[00:26:43] right now
[00:26:45] uh uh oh oh oh new weapons never mind
[00:26:48] we're not done actually okay this is
[00:26:50] installing we have to talk about this
[00:26:51] this is installing this is installing
[00:26:53] this is installing what was that it's
[00:26:55] literally just characters I want to talk
[00:26:57] about but but they're not ranked it
[00:26:58] doesn't matter I mean the archons are if
[00:26:59] you're wondering this is how the archons
[00:27:01] are ranked by the way just just in case
[00:27:03] you're wondering and if you disagree
[00:27:04] you're objectively wrong I mean it could
[00:27:05] be this if your depends on your account
[00:27:07] but this is true okay people that say
[00:27:09] this uh they need to seek medical
[00:27:11] attention sorry that's not true it's
[00:27:13] personal preference it depends on your
[00:27:15] account too anyways
[00:27:19] um actually no that's not
[00:27:21] true okay listen we're going to don't
[00:27:24] clip that though I don't want to have to
[00:27:25] defend that opinion nahita over finina
[00:27:27] ain't no way are you are
[00:27:30] you whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa my phone
[00:27:34] just F
[00:27:36] listen bro you listen I am the biggest
[00:27:39] finina lover I love finina I think she
[00:27:42] gives you so much value but Nikita is
[00:27:44] literally the most broken she is so good
[00:27:49] and dendro is so calm down calm down
[00:27:51] calm down zck also the thing with finina
[00:27:53] is like she's really cracked but you
[00:27:55] know who else is really cracked every
[00:27:56] Hydro five star basic Bally except like
[00:27:58] Mona but Mona's still pretty good and
[00:27:59] it's literally like most of the like if
[00:28:01] you don't need her cuz you can net you
[00:28:02] can yolan you could Ki you can n you
[00:28:04] could child well child's well only has
[00:28:05] one team same with NE but still you
[00:28:07] could [ __ ] Singo Singo by the way
[00:28:09] Singo where the [ __ ] is Singo Singo is
[00:28:11] like here by the way but anyways it is
[00:28:12] what it is I'm actually going to leave
[00:28:13] him there but yeah but fina's cracked
[00:28:15] but Nikita is just too broken in my
[00:28:25] opinion yeah also someone said dendro
[00:28:28] has less op options which is true alam's
[00:28:30] cracked BYU can be good especially with
[00:28:32] finina but he's not like broken on his
[00:28:34] own but like BYU ya ya are pretty good
[00:28:35] as like healers but like other than that
[00:28:37] it's like who are you [ __ ] replacing
[00:28:38] Nita with no
[00:28:41] one
[00:28:43] Cole K is not bad with NE but yeah and
[00:28:46] like 15sec rotation teams like kach
[00:28:47] let's let's just move on okay genin
[00:28:49] impact just tweeted oh roses and muskets
[00:28:52] let me pause my
[00:28:54] music rewind oh by the way when the
[00:28:56] weapon matter drops remind me so I can
[00:28:58] uh we might make it YouTube being good
[00:29:00] at what they do when are you [ __ ]
[00:29:02] stupid calm down I'm not going to Flame
[00:29:04] someone hey thanks 100 bits I appreciate
[00:29:06] you listen this isn't a [ __ ] tier
[00:29:08] list why do you think every character is
[00:29:09] in this tier do you think do you really
[00:29:11] think all of these characters are in the
[00:29:12] same do you think child and Kaza are the
[00:29:14] same tier wake up I just don't want to
[00:29:17] show a tier list on stream CU then I
[00:29:18] have to explain it okay if I'm being I
[00:29:21] don't want to show a to your list okay
[00:29:23] cuz then I have to explain it then I
[00:29:24] have to explain it and I don't want to
[00:29:26] that's why I just talked about archons
[00:29:29] okay I just kept the categories so that
[00:29:31] when I'm making my video I don't have to
[00:29:33] redo
[00:29:36] it yolan and K are the same tier true yo
[00:29:38] unironically listen hear me out listen
[00:29:40] unironically because yolon is basically
[00:29:43] a second SRO and SRO is like the best
[00:29:44] unit in the game and Kwa is just like a
[00:29:47] second sucros but sucros is also like
[00:29:48] the best unit in the game it's actually
[00:29:50] not that far off the truth
[00:29:56] anyways
[00:30:02] anyways we're not talk about it this
[00:30:04] isn't ranked okay they're not ranked
[00:30:06] they're literally not ranked don't talk
[00:30:08] to me I just don't want to remove them
[00:30:10] they're not ranked shut the [ __ ] up they
[00:30:12] literally aren't they literally aren't
[00:30:16] ranked remove them I'm not removing them
[00:30:19] well I just wanted to talk about AR
[00:30:20] actually it would if anything it would
[00:30:22] be
[00:30:24] like like this but we're not going to
[00:30:27] talk about this right now we're not
[00:30:28] going to talk about this right now
[00:30:29] anyways no
[00:30:32] stalling you're iron one in what
[00:30:44] I okay let's keep going whoa gen impact
[00:30:49] just tweeted the new weapons coming out
[00:30:52] let's see if they're good because I sure
[00:30:54] as hell am getting the verdict Clore
[00:30:56] because it's a [ __ ] axe hopefully
[00:30:58] it's good for
[00:30:59] uh hopefully it's good for Navia well it
[00:31:02] obviously will be good for Navia but
[00:31:03] hopefully I can use on my duuke as well
[00:31:05] maybe on another character so let's see
[00:31:07] what it does are these the world's
[00:31:09] crispiest fries let's find
[00:31:16] out okay verdict Claymore let's look
[00:31:19] let's look through it let's look at it
[00:31:20] okay I actually don't know what this
[00:31:21] does by the way I'm not even like
[00:31:22] pretending like I actually don't know
[00:31:23] what this does so we're going to read it
[00:31:24] together and learn it together same with
[00:31:26] the ultimate what the [ __ ] is that
[00:31:30] called verdict Claymore 674 base tag
[00:31:33] which is really high that's as high as
[00:31:34] Aquilla which means it's like basically
[00:31:36] like the highest you can get for a five
[00:31:37] star with a 22 crit rate
[00:31:40] stat High base stack weapons are good
[00:31:42] for characters that obviously scill with
[00:31:44] attack um it also can can help like with
[00:31:46] like well yeah I mean it doesn't really
[00:31:49] yeah anyways 22 grid rate 20% attack on
[00:31:51] the effect that's nice oh yeah there's
[00:31:54] the [ __ ] uh what's the weapon that
[00:31:55] has more than 67 you song of broken
[00:31:57] Pines song of broken pin is like
[00:32:00] 721 what is it 721 if it's 721 I'm a
[00:32:02] [ __ ] genius song of broken Pines let
[00:32:05] me see if it's 721 I'm whipping my [ __ ]
[00:32:09] out I don't think it's 721 that's why I
[00:32:11] said that what is it oh 41 I was
[00:32:13] actually close I was close anyways it's
[00:32:15] a high base attack weapon High base let
[00:32:17] me reset cuz now if someone watches this
[00:32:19] clip looking for information and they
[00:32:21] hear all of that reset whoa genjin just
[00:32:24] tweeted weapons let's look at what they
[00:32:26] do first first of all verdict Claymore
[00:32:28] 674 base attack that's high very high
[00:32:30] for a five star uh 22 crit rate as well
[00:32:32] which is decent it's like 44 crit value
[00:32:34] not bad like a good amount of crit rate
[00:32:36] you also get 20% attack on the passive
[00:32:37] which is great and then let's read what
[00:32:39] the rest
[00:32:40] does okay the rest is i i before I even
[00:32:43] read it I see crystalize so I assume
[00:32:46] that everything else comes if you run a
[00:32:47] geoc character so first of all how good
[00:32:49] is this weapon with no geoc character
[00:32:50] well 674 base stack 22 crit rate and
[00:32:53] another 20% attack right there is
[00:32:55] already pretty good like just as the
[00:32:57] stas stic honestly it's not bad just
[00:32:59] just from that if you scale with attack
[00:33:00] if you don't scale with attack no cuz
[00:33:01] you're only getting 22 crit rate but if
[00:33:03] you scale with attack 6 and4 base attack
[00:33:04] and 20% attack is good now what if
[00:33:06] you're running strong leader team albo
[00:33:08] Navia you're a Geo user okay you also
[00:33:10] get whenever you crystallize a seal ar
[00:33:14] ar this seal will increase your
[00:33:16] Elemental skill damage okay skill damage
[00:33:19] by 18% the seal lasts for 15 seconds and
[00:33:22] you can get off to two stacks so 18 * 2
[00:33:25] 36 and all of the seals will disappear
[00:33:27] 2% uh 2 seconds after the skill deals
[00:33:29] damage I assume once yeah when it deals
[00:33:32] damage it
[00:33:33] disappears okay but you can get it back
[00:33:37] cuz there's no it's last yeah okay okay
[00:33:40] oi yo I pull this for EO he Chucks his
[00:33:45] moo Chuck
[00:33:46] USI yo yo we're playing okay I'm getting
[00:33:49] this foro I don't think for the
[00:33:52] record it's just a bunch of attack um I
[00:33:55] mean the elemental damage is actually
[00:33:56] not bad right cuz oh no it's only for
[00:33:58] your skill it's Elemental skill it's not
[00:34:00] Elemental damage it's Elemental skill
[00:34:02] damage
[00:34:05] yeah wait I actually want to go a full
[00:34:07] USI build ain't red horn better for EO
[00:34:10] definitely but for ushi so the thing
[00:34:13] with ushi is he scales on attack I'm
[00:34:15] pretty sure I'm pretty sure USI actually
[00:34:17] just scales on attack obviously like
[00:34:19] itto's
[00:34:20] defense uh will buff him but ushi's like
[00:34:23] base scaling like his defense okay like
[00:34:26] the you get B attack based on your
[00:34:27] defense but ushi itself is just skill
[00:34:30] damage so you could
[00:34:34] technically dude you can go at USI
[00:34:38] build anyways that's just memes memes
[00:34:41] aside good stat stick especially if
[00:34:43] you're crystallizing in your team but
[00:34:44] even without it high base attack plus
[00:34:46] 20% attack plus 202 crit rate pretty
[00:34:47] decent for a claymore uh is it going to
[00:34:49] be better than like serpent spine that
[00:34:51] gives you insane amounts of damage
[00:34:52] percent honestly I don't even know a lot
[00:34:54] of characters might just want Ser spine
[00:34:55] but that's also a battle pass weapon
[00:34:56] that You refin by buying more battle
[00:34:58] passes so you
[00:35:02] know um this is good I mean like it's
[00:35:06] pretty good in terms of a not like high
[00:35:08] crit stat weapon if you can use the
[00:35:09] attack it's good and then the skill
[00:35:11] damage can be nice in practice who could
[00:35:13] the skill damage be nice on probably
[00:35:14] Navia this proves that Navia is going to
[00:35:15] be a skill user uh I'd say duuke but it
[00:35:18] only Buffs one right because it
[00:35:19] disappears right after your skill does
[00:35:20] damage so I mean that it'll probably
[00:35:22] still be good for him because of the
[00:35:24] attack but for the second part it's kind
[00:35:26] of just a little bonus uh I mean if you
[00:35:29] vape it it could be a big bonus who else
[00:35:31] who's a claymore that spam your skill I
[00:35:33] mean cave well he doesn't really
[00:35:37] SP B Parry but who
[00:35:41] cares uh who the [ __ ] a claymore
[00:35:46] character
[00:35:48] yeah
[00:35:49] de anyways okay that's
[00:35:55] verdict now we have have the ultimate
[00:35:57] overlords Mega magic sword U
[00:36:01] MMS
[00:36:04] Claymore this thing looks like it's made
[00:36:06] of cardboard matter of fact I think it's
[00:36:07] made of
[00:36:08] cardboard you get 565 base attack which
[00:36:11] is pretty high for a
[00:36:12] fourstar 30% energy recharge which is
[00:36:15] nice uh if your Claymore character can
[00:36:16] use this 12% attack I assume at R5 it
[00:36:19] will be 24% which honestly is actually
[00:36:23] not bad because a high Bas St Claymore
[00:36:25] doesn't give like that much attack on
[00:36:27] its secondary stat but that's pretty
[00:36:29] decent it it's 24 and then that's not
[00:36:31] all what why the [ __ ] does it say that's
[00:36:34] not all in its effect that's not all the
[00:36:37] support from the melines you've helped
[00:36:39] in mer wait what if I didn't help any
[00:36:43] [ __ ] fills you up with strength based on
[00:36:46] the number of them you've helped what
[00:36:50] no yo what do you mean based on the
[00:36:54] number eight no way I need to
[00:37:00] explore they said if yo they said each
[00:37:04] arinara you saved Buffs your attack okay
[00:37:06] it's over it's actually over it's
[00:37:08] actually over I mean
[00:37:11] that okay let's assume that at R5 it's
[00:37:14] 24 and 24 right 48 attack with 565 base
[00:37:19] attack is already good for a claymore
[00:37:22] even if you don't use the ER and then
[00:37:24] the third ER makes it really good this
[00:37:25] actually looks like ins stats am I
[00:37:27] coping for an event R5 this actually
[00:37:29] looks like a lot of stats obviously like
[00:37:31] serent SP and stuff would always Prevail
[00:37:32] but as like a free to-play weapon this
[00:37:34] looks really good let me look up title
[00:37:35] Shadows
[00:37:37] again title Shadows I don't really like
[00:37:40] using the wiki for that but whatever uh
[00:37:43] title Shadows is 48 okay title Shadows
[00:37:46] is a lot if you get healed as well but
[00:37:47] the base tack is lower and high base
[00:37:49] tack does matter and this also gives you
[00:37:51] 30 ER which would make it like incred
[00:37:53] yeah oh my God yeah it's it's not always
[00:37:57] the best option it's not always the best
[00:37:59] option for like free to play cuz like
[00:38:00] you might want title if you don't need
[00:38:01] the ER but the base stack is really high
[00:38:04] and you get a lot of attack if R5 it's
[00:38:07] actually really cracked also you might
[00:38:08] not have enough prototypes to R5 a
[00:38:09] weapon like this cuz it is like the new
[00:38:13] protypes
[00:38:15] um yeah that's actually really good I
[00:38:18] like
[00:38:20] it yeah B can use it uh YULA can use it
[00:38:25] honestly a lot of claymor can't well
[00:38:27] duuke can't he doesn't really want the
[00:38:28] ER although the attack's fine genuinely
[00:38:30] CU prototype archaic prototype
[00:38:34] archaic prototype archaic is the same ba
[00:38:37] uh base attack but it gives you 27%
[00:38:40] attack and another instance of damage
[00:38:42] but 27% attack instead of 24 * 2 which
[00:38:45] is 48 on top of er which would be
[00:38:48] useless there but yeah so it's actually
[00:38:50] pretty good I like it tidle Shadows is
[00:38:53] really good too but this one if you can
[00:38:54] use the AR is pretty cracked in my
[00:38:56] opinion
[00:38:58] if I'm wrong tell me I'm wrong but it
[00:39:01] looks really good first impression it's
[00:39:04] kind of ugly I mean it's cardboard so
[00:39:06] maybe are you going to make a meloine
[00:39:08] quest
[00:39:14] stream anyways uh this also proves that
[00:39:18] Navia scales on attack probably and
[00:39:22] relies on her skill because that's how
[00:39:24] weapons for certain characters look like
[00:39:27] usually again I could be wrong I
[00:39:29] actually don't know I'll probably know
[00:39:31] in like two days but it's Lally attack
[00:39:33] percent and uh skill damage so yeah okay
[00:39:37] anyways get your time whoa finally not
[00:39:48] stalling okay usually my camera is here
[00:39:51] but when I do the Arkham Quest okay I'll
[00:39:52] just move it up when I do the Arkham

[00:43:50] think it's going to cost like probably
[00:43:52] like a 100 gifted cuz aboba is like such
[00:43:55] a
[00:43:57] magic can't cheat death you know aboba
[00:43:59] is such like a a a central piece of the
[00:44:03] Zio stream at this point it's like
[00:44:05] synonymous with me so I can't just
[00:44:06] remove it okay well I missed that chest

[00:47:55] Expedition
[00:47:59] [ __ ] no freeo play pulls every Banner
[00:48:02] I'm not a freeto play I'm like a shrimp
[00:48:05] okay I'm like a I'm like a relatable
[00:48:08] like like like seal I'm like a chubby
[00:48:10] seal okay they're cute they're nice but
[00:48:12] they're not like a fully-fledged whale
[00:48:13] they're not like a leviathan they're not
[00:48:15] like carrying the the the the genin
[00:48:19] economy on its back speaking of of of of
[00:48:22] of genin right listen after watching the
[00:48:25] honai star Dev stream I would like to
[00:48:28] say that I am devastated as a genin
[00:48:29] player to see all of the amazing quality
[00:48:33] of life changes we've been asking for
[00:48:34] for years and all the rewards we we have
[00:48:36] been asking for for years go to Star
[00:48:37] rail with that in mind as an as a player
[00:48:40] of both genin and star rail I have
[00:48:42] reached Peak optimality okay cuz look at
[00:48:46] this is why I think this this is not
[00:48:47] even an okay no hashtag ad right now
[00:48:49] listen this is listen no hashtag ad now
[00:48:52] and this is coming I've worked with Gen
[00:48:53] I've worked with star I work with both
[00:48:55] they love me I love them listen well
[00:48:57] except what they did to DEA and Ryden
[00:48:59] should work with b and Yia I'm sorry I
[00:49:02] don't know why I mentioned her she's
[00:49:03] cool anyways uh uh uh listen also rizzly
[00:49:07] C1 should be part of his Base Kit
[00:49:08] constellation should be toggleable
[00:49:10] artifact presets need to happen uh uh uh
[00:49:12] uh uh uh we need more [ __ ] uh either
[00:49:15] abys Wars or a new type of endgame we
[00:49:17] need Co-op and and free aaka but and and
[00:49:21] weapon Banner should still be better
[00:49:22] regardless with that out of the way with
[00:49:24] that out of the way and this for someone
[00:49:25] who doesn't like Goa with that out of
[00:49:27] the way let me keep going yia's fine no
[00:49:29] but remember when listen [ __ ] I
[00:49:32] like Yia okay I just wish I had a reason
[00:49:35] to use her Elemental burst that's all
[00:49:37] that's literally all anyways I'm going
[00:49:39] to keep talking I'm going to keep
[00:49:40] talking okay listen no hashtag right now
[00:49:44] if you want to be happy you either don't
[00:49:46] play gotcha games run away now run or if
[00:49:50] you play both genin and SAR listen then
[00:49:53] you can actually play genin which in my
[00:49:55] my opinion better gameplay while also
[00:49:58] being happy for a ton of just all the
[00:50:00] rewards you thought we would get that
[00:50:02] we're never getting in another game now
[00:50:04] surely they're going to come to genin
[00:50:06] but honestly I have no hope I would like
[00:50:08] to think I would like to pray and and
[00:50:10] believe so I would like to to to to hope
[00:50:13] for a brighter tomorrow okay I would
[00:50:15] like to believe that we're also going to
[00:50:17] get those in genin I would like to
[00:50:19] believe that the free aaka that I got at
[00:50:21] ar42 uh that we all 1.0 players got will
[00:50:25] will be accessible to other players as
[00:50:27] well but I don't know if that's
[00:50:29] realistic which is
[00:50:32] why cuz I think
[00:50:36] genin okay I
[00:50:39] think if we feel like a neglected child
[00:50:42] surely will get more rewards that's my
[00:50:44] copium take but my like reason like my
[00:50:47] logical take is genin's doing really
[00:50:49] well so they're like okay genin's doing
[00:50:51] well and Then star rail they're like
[00:50:52] well let's just give them a bunch of
[00:50:53] rewards so people play more is is my
[00:50:55] internal take but I like both games so I
[00:50:57] don't really care I mean I do care I
[00:50:59] want to get get more too but like I like
[00:51:00] both games so I'm happy as long as if
[00:51:02] any if either of D's happy I'm happy
[00:51:04] whatever but
[00:51:06] like I don't know why we're not getting
[00:51:09] some at least we're getting the
[00:51:10] Expedition and the like we are getting
[00:51:12] more quality of life now but we should
[00:51:13] get more than more does that make sense
[00:51:15] like we used to be at like one out of 10
[00:51:17] quality of life updates or like two out
[00:51:19] of 10 then since starel started getting
[00:51:21] a bunch now we're at like four five cuz
[00:51:24] we're getting Expedition domain restart
[00:51:26] but like where is the other stuff why in
[00:51:27] Abyss like I don't have the reset one
[00:51:29] chamber why can't I auto [ __ ] preset
[00:51:31] a team why can't I artifact preset why
[00:51:33] can't I [ __ ] yo why
[00:51:54] can't
[00:51:57] why I have to talk to zavier what the
[00:52:01] [ __ ] okay this is not
[00:52:17] the why can't we get naked Lisa skin
[00:52:20] okay this is precisely why we can't have
[00:52:23] nice things in gen an impact okay we
[00:52:25] have to ask for reasonable things or our
[00:52:27] overlords our our our our our developers
[00:52:30] will look at us and say wow look at this
[00:52:32] degenerate Community maybe we shouldn't
[00:52:35] cater towards them okay so as a
[00:52:37] community we need to ask for for
[00:52:39] reasonable things okay reasonable things
[00:52:42] okay maybe maybe we should ask for a
[00:52:44] standard Banner we can choose a standard
[00:52:46] Banner five star maybe we should get new
[00:52:48] characters in The Standard Banner okay a
[00:52:50] standard Banner overhaul maybe maybe
[00:52:53] artifact maybe alham Tak takes his shirt
[00:52:55] off that's a lot more reasonable now let
[00:52:59] me claim all before I forget we're going
[00:53:01] to take a guide to uh wait wait Nava's
[00:53:04] mats they they announced them officially

[00:53:14] remember go you
[00:53:21] go oh [ __ ] I didn't think this far ahead

[00:53:32] it has 240 Em which is like best in slot
[00:53:35] for em

[01:07:31] rley Your Grace good to see you y is
[01:07:34] there something you wish to see me about
[01:07:37] yeah what was with that earthquake just
[01:07:38] now kurami there was a 10
[01:07:42] gifted appreciate it ah that the Tremor
[01:07:45] didn't originate from the seafloor in
[01:07:48] fact it seems it came from the surface
[01:07:49] from the surface over the years of
[01:07:50] serving as the warden here I have
[01:07:52] developed a sense for distinguishing
[01:07:54] between what occurs on the surface and
[01:07:56] what occurs
[01:07:57] underwater besides the seal that M net
[01:08:00] set in place won't fail so EAS not a bad
[01:08:02] pronunciation on M also I think the
[01:08:06] dialog volume is a bit quiet I'll turn
[01:08:07] up after this cut scene also I think
[01:08:09] nevet just earthquake so the Fortress is
[01:08:12] okay if you recall our last incident If
[01:08:15] there really were a problem there would
[01:08:16] be crowds of inmates in a panic right
[01:08:18] now huh you've got a point okay seems we
[01:08:22] need to get back to the the surface and

[01:13:28] that's right and we came here to see you
[01:13:30] right away
[01:13:32] nice you and Pon tell nevet everything
[01:13:34] that happened since the primordial sea
[01:13:36] incident as well as your dream regarding
[01:13:37] child wh do you have any idea what that
[01:13:41] might be that's you chat you're the
[01:13:42] massive whale from your description not
[01:13:44] me though that cannot have occurred in
[01:13:46] any ordinary Waters but rather something
[01:13:48] like the primordial sea okay I'm looking
[01:13:52] I'm going to stop yapping dur the AR
[01:13:53] Quest I probably won't but during
[01:13:55] important moments I won't anyways I look
[01:13:57] at my audio mixer and I my mic goes to
[01:14:00] the high yellow almost red and the game
[01:14:02] only stays in the green should I turn
[01:14:04] the game up even
[01:14:06] louder or is it fine anyways let's keep
[01:14:09] going a whale of that size and shape
[01:14:11] cannot usually be found in the waters of
[01:14:13] tat therefore we can only child is
[01:14:17] presently immersed in primordial
[01:14:19] seawater immersed in primordial seawater
[01:14:23] what hell he's not from font Pon most
[01:14:25] people wouldn't be capable of entering
[01:14:27] he I'm not completely sure how he could
[01:14:30] have gotten there myself there's
[01:14:32] something we'd like to ask you
[01:14:34] about are you free to what is it are you
[01:14:37] free all right P felt it too we asked
[01:14:40] the Duke and he said it wasn't from
[01:14:42] underwater so we figured you might know
[01:14:44] something about it it turns out that I
[01:14:46] have just received a report about this
[01:14:48] particular matter in fact that's exactly
[01:14:51] what I was busy with a moment ago
[01:14:53] the source of the Tremor was here on the
[01:14:55] surface near Pon after the shaking
[01:14:58] stopped the water in the pon area Rose
[01:15:01] at an alarming rate Chad PLO means fish
[01:15:03] and Rose is a flower yeah you might not
[01:15:05] have known that the water levels Rose
[01:15:08] I'm so funny what about the people
[01:15:11] there the water levels only Rose for a
[01:15:14] short period of time and have already
[01:15:16] returned to normal now however I still
[01:15:19] have a bad feeling about the whole
[01:15:21] phenomenon if the change in water levels
[01:15:23] is connected with the leaking primordial
[01:15:25] seawater and the situation in Pon may be
[01:15:28] much worse than it appears okay that's
[01:15:31] interesting should be Inon right we need
[01:15:33] to go check on her oh
[01:15:36] no I would also like to go there as soon
[01:15:38] as possible but I'm afraid I can't leave
[01:15:41] just yet oh no we must immediately
[01:15:43] formulate disaster prevention plans for
[01:15:44] the surrounding coastal areas to avoid
[01:15:47] potential I'll have to ask you two to go
[01:15:48] to poron first I'll meet you there to
[01:15:51] check on the situation once I finish
[01:15:52] things here here sounds like a plan
[01:15:54] never that no time to lose let's get
[01:15:56] going please be
[01:15:59] careful okay let me turn the game volume
[01:16:02] up before I start yapping cuz I don't
[01:16:03] want to be way louder than the sound
[01:16:05] actually no I almost screamed calm down
[01:16:07] uh I'll make it I'll make dialog 10 okay
[01:16:11] listen first of all I'm excited for this
[01:16:13] Quest I've heard only good things that
[01:16:15] I've managed to avoid spoilers
[01:16:17] however all I know we talked about this

[01:19:38] you
[01:19:39] okay oh hi
[01:19:41] Navia honestly all of the casualties
[01:19:44] were were worth it if it meant seeing
[01:19:46] you again hey
[01:19:49] I'm we heard there was a situation in B
[01:19:52] so we came came as quickly as we could
[01:19:54] question mark okay I didn't mean that
[01:19:55] sorry as you can see the water level
[01:19:57] suddenly Rose it caused quite the
[01:20:00] disturbance in
[01:20:09] fact deisel there was a wounded resident
[01:20:12] next to a building like black and gold
[01:20:13] like outfit already transported him to
[01:20:15] safety but we've run out of medical
[01:20:19] supplies he's wounded how badly he fell
[01:20:24] so it's probably a broken leg he's
[01:20:26] pretty shaken up when the water level
[01:20:28] Rose he desperately climbed up to the
[01:20:30] roof once the water receded and he saw
[01:20:32] the ground he became terrified and
[01:20:36] eventually he jumped down then find the
[01:20:39] leader of squad one and tell him to take
[01:20:41] the wounded resident to see a doctor he
[01:20:44] should know where to
[01:20:45] go understood I'll take over his search
[01:20:48] and rescue mission in the meantime all
[01:20:50] right you'll be in
[01:20:51] charge
[01:20:55] I'm sorry where were we uh this
[01:20:59] situation imp H right allow me to
[01:21:03] explain I'm L little earlier we suddenly
[01:21:06] heard a loud wait why is it so quiet
[01:21:08] hello at first everyone thought that
[01:21:09] something might have exploded in the
[01:21:11] waterways but before we knew it Water
[01:21:15] started pouring out from
[01:21:18] everywhere it's a bug I mean okay well I
[01:21:21] barely a little earlier we suddenly
[01:21:23] heard a loud noise at first everyone
[01:21:24] thought that something might have
[01:21:25] exploded in the waterways but before we
[01:21:27] knew it Water started pouring out from
[01:21:29] everywhere Rushing Water seemed a little
[01:21:31] odd almost like the unique color of
[01:21:34] primordial
[01:21:35] seawater some people didn't realize the
[01:21:38] danger and thought it was just ordinary
[01:21:40] water leaking from somewhere okay
[01:21:43] everyone on the street who happened to
[01:21:45] be close to the water didn't have a
[01:21:47] chance to
[01:21:49] escape as the water levels Rose they
[01:21:52] suddenly
[01:21:55] disappeared they were all dissolved
[01:21:59] those who realized what was happening
[01:22:01] started to flee in a panic desperately
[01:22:03] trying to get to Higher Ground many were
[01:22:06] injured in the Stampede and some some
[01:22:09] people fell from significant
[01:22:14] Heights the spad Rula initiated rescue
[01:22:18] operations as quickly as possible but
[01:22:20] there have been a lot of
[01:22:24] casualties fortunately the water began
[01:22:27] to recede after some time and the chaos
[01:22:29] came to an end the water that flooded
[01:22:32] the area contained primordial seawater
[01:22:35] so the lower levels of Pon are still
[01:22:37] hazardous to ensure everyone's safety
[01:22:40] I've asked the people there to leave as
[01:22:42] soon as possible no one knows if this
[01:22:44] could happen
[01:22:46] again all we can do for now is try our
[01:22:50] best to help Evacuate the residents okay
[01:22:53] we still haven't completed the head
[01:22:54] count but we'll have some numbers soon
[01:22:57] how awful and all of this just came out
[01:23:01] of nowhere it was quite frightening
[01:23:05] indeed I only wish that everything that
[01:23:08] just happened was a bad dream is there
[01:23:12] any way we can help Navia yeah we're
[01:23:14] here to help thank you for being so
[01:23:17] willing to help in a moment of Crisis
[01:23:19] like this you don't know how much it
[01:23:22] means to me I
[01:23:25] really can't express how grateful I
[01:23:29] am we're missing some people aren't we
[01:23:32] uh-oh uh-oh oh no NAIA oh no silver no
[01:23:38] [Music]
[01:23:40] no wait they're wait but they're not on
[01:23:42] wait if we listen listen okay listen
[01:23:45] Now's the Time I can say it the only
[01:23:47] thing I saw in the Navia trailer was
[01:23:49] that silver and M weren't there but if
[01:23:51] we don't see them in the quest they
[01:23:54] could be somewhere else dude it they
[01:23:56] weren't necessarily here let's
[01:23:58] ask oh no I'm sorry for asking Navia
[01:24:01] deisel we've got a situation
[01:24:06] here I'll be right there yo yo what is
[01:24:10] this I'll shut
[01:24:12] up sorry I need to go for now no they're
[01:24:16] actually dude they could be fine and now
[01:24:18] she goes seems it might be a while
[01:24:21] before she can take a break
[01:24:24] bre Navia walks around talking with as
[01:24:27] many people as she can for organ matters
[01:24:29] her decisions are clear and reasonable
[01:24:31] the wounded are being tended to and we
[01:24:33] finished the preliminary headcount more

[01:29:13] back we're back we're back well given
[01:29:15] the time of day and the whole situation
[01:29:17] in pon pon doesn't think there'd be a
[01:29:20] ton of people here visiting graves right
[01:29:24] that's how things are now she sounds so
[01:29:28] sad are so exhausted that they've no
[01:29:30] strength to spare any words for the dead
[01:29:33] um
[01:29:35] Navia there's no need to push yourself
[01:29:37] okay that's kind of a bad line given
[01:29:40] that a bunch of her friends died and
[01:29:42] people and like people that lived that
[01:29:43] probably not the best time to say don't
[01:29:45] push there's no need to push yourself so
[01:29:49] hard uhoh yo yo
[01:29:53] no Navia what's wrong y Huger sorry
[01:29:58] I I
[01:30:01] just Malo and
[01:30:04] silver they won't ever come back here
[01:30:08] again what should I do
[01:30:14] Papa oh
[01:30:16] huh what happened to them
[01:30:20] Navia everyone agreed on the rescue plan
[01:30:23] but
[01:30:25] still I was the one who initiated it
[01:30:28] they were helping Evacuate the residents
[01:30:31] but they couldn't leave in time
[01:30:35] and and they were caught in the
[01:30:40] seawater what should we do Ive known
[01:30:44] them for so
[01:30:47] long and I know they weren't
[01:30:49] afraid but
[01:30:52] but I could at least hold a funeral for
[01:30:55] my father and I know where he
[01:30:59] rests but as for malose and silver
[01:31:01] they're just
[01:31:04] gone I just can't now my
[01:31:09] goats Oh I thought everything looks so
[01:31:13] clean after it rains even the
[01:31:16] gravestones I didn't expect that you'd
[01:31:19] enjoy a glass of red wine in front of
[01:31:21] Master Call's grave I can understand
[01:31:25] besides the scenery here isn't half bad
[01:31:28] see it's not just me I always want to
[01:31:32] bring something when I visit Papa
[01:31:35] perhaps we might even have a picnic
[01:31:37] that's [ __ ] he wouldn't be angry would
[01:31:39] he how could Master ever be upset with
[01:31:42] you demoiselle yet the cemetery is the
[01:31:45] home of those who have passed is it not
[01:31:49] everyone ends up here sooner or later no
[01:31:52] matter who you are buying yourself a
[01:31:54] plot in advance are you no need
[01:31:58] yet but when I do I hope you'll let me
[01:32:01] be buried beside Master callus
[01:32:04] demoiselle hey stop Jing wa maybe he's
[01:32:07] not dead Okay hear me out he wants to be
[01:32:09] buried next to the master so what if in
[01:32:12] order to fulfill his wish he can't die
[01:32:15] without his body being found so he's te
[01:32:16] he's on vacation the Riders didn't
[01:32:19] actually kill him true he's still alive
[01:32:21] maybe no he's not I'm quite serious that
[01:32:24] way it will save us both the trip to see
[01:32:26] each other whenever you visit your
[01:32:28] father's
[01:32:31] grave that makes sense in that case
[01:32:35] could I be buried on his other side
[01:32:38] after all besides you yeah man we got it
[01:32:40] the two of us could certainly be
[01:32:43] considered Master's closest companions
[01:32:45] no yeah man personally I believe we fill
[01:32:48] those shoes just
[01:32:50] fine why are you bringing this up all of
[01:32:53] a sudden
[01:32:56] seriously all right all right I'll L
[01:32:59] forhad out it but I'd really prefer not
[01:33:02] to talk about this stuff and what do you
[01:33:05] mean by saving me a trip I'd make the
[01:33:07] journey even if I had to visit you two
[01:33:09] somewhere
[01:33:11] else I'd promised to let them rest in
[01:33:14] peace
[01:33:15] here but here I am breaking that
[01:33:20] promise I'm sorry for letting you see me
[01:33:23] in a mess like this I don't usually cry
[01:33:27] really Pon doesn't know how to help you
[01:33:30] feel better but I had always thought I
[01:33:34] could make my wishes come
[01:33:36] true but now that I think about it that
[01:33:40] never solely relied on me many things
[01:33:44] can only be accomplished with someone
[01:33:45] else's help Mose and silver have helped
[01:33:49] me so much
[01:33:52] but by
[01:33:53] contrast I could do nothing for them I'm
[01:33:57] so sorry that you can spend as much time
[01:34:01] as you need here Navia we'll stay with
[01:34:03] you yeah we're here for you thank you
[01:34:06] right now you don't know how much that
[01:34:09] means by the way you can have a look at
[01:34:12] this it's a list of victims from the
[01:34:15] incident that took place here
[01:34:18] OA
[01:34:19] Khan Bernett
[01:34:23] s
[01:34:25] frine
[01:34:27] Karina Daisy
[01:34:30] Ray okay I'm sking this I'm sorry but
[01:34:32] Meelo and silver were there it's okay I
[01:34:34] just can't listen to Pon for too
[01:34:36] long and you're
[01:34:39] right we lost Malo and
[01:34:42] silver but we were able to save more
[01:34:46] than we
[01:34:47] anticipated the overall outcome
[01:34:50] indicates that the
[01:34:52] cost was worth
[01:34:54] it wait but what if Meo and silver open
[01:34:57] the map and teleported to a waypoint
[01:34:59] right before the primordial seawater
[01:35:00] over like what no one's sacrifice is
[01:35:03] truly necessary right don't think that
[01:35:06] way Navia one person might be saved at
[01:35:09] the expense of another Shore but that
[01:35:12] isn't something we should ever consider
[01:35:14] a trade Malo and silver were not the
[01:35:17] price for saving anyone they're Heroes
[01:35:21] I'm good Pon take for
[01:35:23] once thank you Pon what you said just
[01:35:26] now was pretty amazing
[01:35:29] actually I'll remember your words oh uh
[01:35:34] seems you've become more eloquent in the
[01:35:36] time since
[01:35:39] we wait a second okay arino I always
[01:35:43] love this I always love to see you
[01:35:47] however why are you here at the funeral
[01:35:48] were you involved in this if you killed
[01:35:51] loose or silver we I will have to choose
[01:35:53] a side and I don't know which side I
[01:35:55] will choose however I'm
[01:35:57] always I can't speak I get nervous
[01:36:00] around what are you doing here hello is
[01:36:04] everything going well on your side yes
[01:36:06] my people are carrying out the mission
[01:36:08] according to your request oh wait never
[01:36:09] mind all the residents of Pon have been
[01:36:12] evacuated and we are preparing to
[01:36:14] relocate them to Higher Ground thanks
[01:36:16] father as for these supplies we have
[01:36:18] everything taken care of there is no
[01:36:20] need to worry thank you very
[01:36:24] much wait do you two know each other
[01:36:29] yo dude her design is so sick I'm sorry
[01:36:32] we just met recently right Miss
[01:36:36] Navia usually I would call this a
[01:36:39] coincidental encounter but that doesn't
[01:36:41] quite fit this time besides my mind that
[01:36:45] if a twoy Harbinger would come looking
[01:36:47] for me a little suspicious now you we'll
[01:36:50] let that slide spad rosula received
[01:36:52] generous support from the foule which
[01:36:54] allowed us to complete the rescue and
[01:36:56] evacuation work so quickly Mutual Aid is
[01:37:00] essential to fostering positive
[01:37:02] developments we were already in the area
[01:37:04] in any case so it was nothing that said
[01:37:07] I must say that you're a lot sharper
[01:37:09] than you let on I'm sure you understand
[01:37:12] what I mean I apologize for all the ways
[01:37:15] in which I tested you previously we've
[01:37:18] never worked with a foule before and
[01:37:20] it's extremely important for us to know
[01:37:22] who we're working with my subordinates
[01:37:24] have reported that fouille soldiers have
[01:37:26] been observing water levels and taking
[01:37:28] head counts in various locations I hear
[01:37:31] that they've also prepared a large
[01:37:32] amount of emergency supplies I'm quite
[01:37:36] surprised this is nothing to brag about
[01:37:38] nor do I intend to it is simply the way
[01:37:41] of powerful organizations to act
[01:37:43] forcefully whether they are doing good
[01:37:46] or ill you've witnessed that firsthand
[01:37:49] in any case whatever you say as I've
[01:37:50] told this traveler before I know of the
[01:37:53] prophecy and I intend to prevent the
[01:37:55] impending disaster lending your
[01:37:58] organization a hand was a natural first
[01:38:00] step in accomplishing that as such do
[01:38:03] not be troubled by this token of our
[01:38:06] sincerity perhaps one day you'll also be
[01:38:09] able to help me in the same way without
[01:38:12] your help there would have been many
[01:38:14] more
[01:38:15] casualties I won't forget your kindness
[01:38:18] Chad imagine if arino they make her fire
[01:38:21] that either the red like a different
[01:38:23] color it could be the red on her back
[01:38:24] like it be like a like a black and red
[01:38:26] fire imagine kind of like the Luke skin
[01:38:28] but cooler or blue give her blue fire
[01:38:31] furthermore I sincerely regret what
[01:38:33] happened to Malo and silver I only wish
[01:38:37] that my people could have arrived a
[01:38:38] little earlier to prevent this from
[01:38:41] happening don't say that you and your
[01:38:44] subordinates did everything you
[01:38:48] could as Pimon said Malo silver didn't
[01:38:51] choose to sacrifice themselves for any
[01:38:53] specific person and they weren't the
[01:38:56] price paid for other salvation they
[01:38:59] chose to become Heroes themselves I've
[01:39:03] never liked hearing people put it that
[01:39:04] way it's like trying to relieve pain by
[01:39:07] saying some Noble sounding words but
[01:39:11] right now there's nothing more
[01:39:14] suitable they really did become Heroes
[01:39:17] you're right I'm sorry for your loss
[01:39:19] Miss Navia
[01:39:23] water is life to fontaine's people and
[01:39:26] it also spells disaster it's no wonder
[01:39:29] that people always say that prophecies
[01:39:31] represent fate fortunately I've never
[01:39:35] been one for such opinions okay so
[01:39:38] you're one who will try to change fate
[01:39:40] then of course that is why I'm going to
[01:39:43] Hotel bof I still have some things to
[01:39:46] take care of and the children need my
[01:39:48] attention I mean it's oh tell but nice
[01:39:52] try not bad it's okay I I forgive you I
[01:39:54] could actually teach you AR Lino if ever
[01:39:56] like you're like by way traveler Pon one
[01:39:59] more thing
[01:40:01] yeah all right then we'll
[01:40:03] just uh huh this isn't right P thought
[01:40:09] you would ask us to walk with you for a
[01:40:11] moment so you could tell us something in
[01:40:13] private that is a clever and useful
[01:40:15] conversation technique which I do like
[01:40:17] to use when necessary but there's no
[01:40:20] need today damn she likes na hurt to
[01:40:22] have Miss Navia listening in traveler
[01:40:25] I'm sure you remember that I said we
[01:40:27] could work together when we had the
[01:40:29] chance you and I both know that there
[01:40:31] may be issues with the primordial sea
[01:40:34] previously it was the Fortress of meped
[01:40:36] SLO gate and this time it was the water
[01:40:39] levels in Pon these are both signals so
[01:40:43] the time for Jolly Corporation has come
[01:40:45] indeed allow me to share the latest
[01:40:47] Intel I've received from the house of
[01:40:49] the hearths intelligence Network work
[01:40:51] with you during some recent
[01:40:53] investigations a child claimed to have
[01:40:56] discovered some ruins near Pon the ruins
[01:40:59] date back to ancient times and seem to
[01:41:01] be worth investigating in many ways
[01:41:04] judging by the dating of the ruins they
[01:41:06] may be related to the prophecy and the
[01:41:08] coming crisis the situation is becoming
[01:41:11] more urgent so any pertinent information
[01:41:15] will prove extremely precious okay I'll
[01:41:17] I'll text give me your phone number
[01:41:18] initially came to prepare for ruin
[01:41:20] exploration
[01:41:22] unexpectedly this disaster struck and at
[01:41:25] present we're all busy prioritizing the
[01:41:28] rescue effort so that's why the foule
[01:41:31] were already in Pon I wanted to take the
[01:41:34] children along but unfortunately Linny
[01:41:37] Lynette and fem have all been dispatched
[01:41:39] to Higher Ground to assist affected
[01:41:41] residents bro frem is going to go drown
[01:41:44] again try that was too soon I'm sorry we
[01:41:47] love F in this stream okay good for them
[01:41:49] I'm sure they're helping going told that
[01:41:51] outside of the house the person they
[01:41:53] trust most is you I'm sorry dude he's a
[01:41:56] diver he has one J sorry sorry I'm sorry
[01:41:58] W from an which is why I want to give
[01:42:00] you this task are you sure you that'll
[01:42:02] be okay can you trust an outsider like
[01:42:04] me what why are we calling her the house
[01:42:07] of the hearths members each other as
[01:42:09] family but Lenny Lynette and fine said
[01:42:11] that they also see you as such even
[01:42:15] though you are not from the house I'm
[01:42:17] sure you already understand how Earnest
[01:42:20] they can consider their friendship with
[01:42:21] you to be oh that somehow makes Pon feel
[01:42:26] kind of happy bro you drowned in leway
[01:42:29] about the ruins could fetch a high price
[01:42:31] yeah that is true but since the children
[01:42:33] consider you family it's only natural
[01:42:35] that I he they us
[01:42:38] family got it so all we got to do is go
[01:42:40] to some ruins right we can handle that
[01:42:44] excuse me but may I tag along yes you
[01:42:48] wish to join Miss Navia oh wait her
[01:42:51] are you sure to
[01:42:53] explore you need to rest well I'm sad
[01:42:58] yes but I can't just go back and plop
[01:43:02] myself into a chair by the roadside and
[01:43:04] do nothing there's no point in being
[01:43:07] depressed but we still have a disaster
[01:43:08] on our hands as my father's successor I
[01:43:12] must live up to the hopes he had in me
[01:43:14] great dialogue very sad story
[01:43:17] but why is the dialogue right here it

[01:48:56] fine D I'm dying
[01:49:00] Jeepers hey can okay
[01:49:03] look I know hilly trolls enemies right
[01:49:06] but we just did the Cary bear Quest we
[01:49:08] know that hilly trolls are real people
[01:49:10] and we are currently mourning people
[01:49:12] that got disintegrated by water which
[01:49:14] which basically is pretty similar to you
[01:49:17] know these humans that got cursed so can
[01:49:19] we not have to kill them okay we have to
[01:49:21] kill
[01:49:22] them well [ __ ]
[01:49:25] you okay why am I using scar strike a PP
[01:49:29] sorry no disrespect
[01:49:32] car
[01:49:36] gotcha minus four hilly
[01:49:41] trolls and they're suffering dude I mean
[01:49:44] okay if it's like a if it's some of the
[01:49:46] hilly trolls I get it but dude if you're
[01:49:48] the hilly troll with the Scythe are you
[01:49:49] really suffering that guy looks like
[01:49:51] he's [ __ ] bro he looks kind of he
[01:49:53] looks like he's living the life well
[01:49:56] maybe not okay I guess it would suck to
[01:49:57] be but at least has a scythe he's
[01:50:06] cool this place has also been
[01:50:08] contaminated by primordial
[01:50:11] seawater yeah and a lot of it too stop a
[01:50:17] Fontan would most likely dissolve the
[01:50:19] moment they fell in first of all stop
[01:50:21] having minus one chest we didn't miss
[01:50:23] one second of all Navia please I don't
[01:50:25] want to risk you
[01:50:27] dissolving you should go back for safety
[01:50:29] right you can't go down if there's
[01:50:31] primordial seawater it's too dangerous
[01:50:33] and it won't be any help for you to just
[01:50:35] stay here you
[01:50:39] did don't get by I'm wrong we're not
[01:50:41] saying you're useless it's just that no
[01:50:45] you're right I can't do anything in this
[01:50:49] situation I'll leave this to you from
[01:50:51] the looks of things maybe there's no way

[01:50:56] from like oh
[01:50:59] no wait she's Geo just oh just crystall
[01:51:03] you can just build a rock and climb it
[01:51:05] yep maybe the only way left is forward
[01:51:08] in that case do you want to wait for us
[01:51:11] here the water levels here are unstable
[01:51:14] and there's a chance the water will rise
[01:51:17] so staying here wouldn't be safe either
[01:51:20] I'll go together with you perhaps we'll
[01:51:22] find the exit just up ahead seems like
[01:51:24] there isn't any other option all right

[01:52:49] I saw like another dude do you ever try
[01:52:51] to oh that's the right way okay that's
[01:52:52] another way to go do you ever try to go
[01:52:54] on like the Sid trck like there's like
[01:52:55] two options right there's like one road
[01:52:57] that looks po like bus in and there's
[01:52:58] another road road that looks like no
[01:53:00] one's going there and then you try to go
[01:53:01] to the road that's like less popular but
[01:53:04] it ends up being the popular like it
[01:53:06] okay I explained this terribly it's like
[01:53:08] there's two roads and then one of them
[01:53:10] you think is just a side trck right so
[01:53:11] you just go to see if there's a chest
[01:53:13] but it ends up being the main road and
[01:53:14] then you keep going and it's too far
[01:53:15] gone to go back and you wonder if the
[01:53:17] other Road had like a chest or something
[01:53:19] that you missed and then you can never
[01:53:20] go back no just me
[01:53:24] okay sorry I'm actually sorry for
[01:53:26] speaking I'm sorry I have to listen to

[01:55:42] before with foreign Merchants who had a
[01:55:44] debt dispute with him and we'd resolved
[01:55:46] the matter not long
[01:55:48] ago we were headed to see how things
[01:55:51] were going with him at the moment ah

[01:56:01] too it's good to see all of you how have
[01:56:05] you been I've been great thanks to your
[01:56:08] help those bothersome Merchants finally

[01:56:13] guarantor for that person they were
[01:56:15] knocking at my door day and night even
[01:56:17] my neighbor Oba was getting f up with
[01:56:19] them sometimes force is required to calm

[02:00:18] Call's successor
[02:00:19] the head of the spad rasula someone held
[02:00:23] in high regard by every soul in puon
[02:00:27] after you took over the spena you
[02:00:29] treated all of us just like the late
[02:00:31] Master callus had if anyone in need
[02:00:34] reached out to you for help you
[02:00:36] responded not only you but your butler
[02:00:39] your subordinates nearly everyone in the
[02:00:42] Spina D rasula fought for the well-being
[02:00:45] of those in
[02:00:48] pon wait a moment aren't you just
[02:00:51] proving that I'm a good person yes
[02:00:54] correct absolutely right and that is why
[02:00:59] You Stand Accused you have helped so
[02:01:02] many people get through so many
[02:01:05] difficulties you are one with us we are
[02:01:11] inseparable okay we are one big family
[02:01:13] all of us who are from Pon inextricably
[02:01:17] linked and with you being so
[02:01:19] important we couldn't possibly do
[02:01:22] without you therefore this fair and
[02:01:25] honorable Court shall declare you guilty
[02:01:27] and you shall stay here you will be
[02:01:30] together with us forever I'm
[02:01:34] good what are you saying I'll pass on
[02:01:37] that everything you have said is correct
[02:01:41] I have indeed done a lot for my hometown
[02:01:44] and I would be willing to be with you
[02:01:46] all but what is the purpose of having me
[02:01:48] stand here like this what is there to
[02:01:51] discuss oh well if that's what you think
[02:01:55] then I have no further
[02:01:58] comments how wonderful Miss
[02:02:05] Navia I know all these
[02:02:08] people why are they
[02:02:12] laughing me too silver I seem to
[02:02:15] remember now yes I get it this trial is
[02:02:21] wait just a moment th this isn't
[02:02:24] right yo
[02:02:27] Malo what was that Mr Malo our
[02:02:31] conclusion is very clear and unanimous
[02:02:34] let the court judge her now she's guilty
[02:02:38] stay here Navia you're one of
[02:02:42] us deel don't admit guilt this trial
[02:02:45] means to keep you here
[02:02:47] forever I wish to exercise my right to
[02:02:50] defend our lady Mr swanfield you only
[02:02:53] know of n's goodness but nothing of her
[02:02:56] utterly independent mind she was born a
[02:02:59] free and independent Spirit she has
[02:03:01] never been tied down by anything indeed
[02:03:04] even the death of Master callus couldn't
[02:03:05] stop her her actions cannot serve as
[02:03:08] proof that she identifies herself as
[02:03:11] part of any group she merely acted as an
[02:03:13] individual extending her hand to help
[02:03:16] others please do not mistake actions as
[02:03:20] being otherwise true really as an
[02:03:23] individual you say don't forget we are
[02:03:26] all fontans here this is the nation of
[02:03:30] Justice the nation of hydro even if Miss
[02:03:34] Navia only voluntarily rendered her
[02:03:36] assistance that doesn't change the fact
[02:03:38] that her beautiful soul must return to
[02:03:42] everyone water accepts all blends with
[02:03:46] all it will surely accept accept her
[02:03:49] kind actually uh sorry defendant but uh
[02:03:52] my client here actually was not trying
[02:03:53] to be nice she just thought you were
[02:03:55] ugly as [ __ ] and dumb and couldn't do
[02:03:56] anything on your own so she acted
[02:03:58] because she thought that you needed help
[02:04:00] because you're stupid and purely
[02:04:03] dependent incom
[02:04:05] incomprehensible buffoon which is why
[02:04:08] she tried to help you guys out a bunch
[02:04:09] of [ __ ] idiots you are she actually
[02:04:11] doesn't deserve to be here or to be
[02:04:13] blended with the likes of you so I rest
[02:04:15] my case everything is measured here in
[02:04:18] the nation of hydro and in the end
[02:04:20] everyone shall meld together thus when a
[02:04:24] unanimous opinion emerges that opinion
[02:04:27] represents Justice now I speak for
[02:04:31] everyone our opinion is consistent Navia
[02:04:35] should stay we and Navia are one okay
[02:04:39] and you would call this Justice
[02:04:42] Preposterous Preposterous you going to
[02:04:45] jail that still has a chance to exist as
[02:04:49] an individual have you forgotten how
[02:04:52] much you all once wronged to become
[02:04:54] individuals to become
[02:04:57] independent do you mean to
[02:04:59] Def yo what the [ __ ] your Justice is
[02:05:03] flawed then why should we acknowledge it
[02:05:05] as you said we can also have our own
[02:05:09] Justice silver and I shall defend demel
[02:05:13] and that is how we will enforce Justice
[02:05:18] uh
[02:05:19] my head um it hurts yo what up dude
[02:05:24] deis they're actually carrying us it
[02:05:27] hurts my head is
[02:05:29] spinning all I can see is Stars swirling
[02:05:31] in front of me I remember now everything
[02:05:35] that seemed odd from the very
[02:05:40] beginning Karina Desi Ray joyville Jolan
[02:05:44] Essen and Mr jaer and Mrs Bernett who we
[02:05:47] met earlier
[02:05:49] even Malo and
[02:05:51] silver no I don't want to admit no but

[02:06:00] dead don't be afraid and don't admit
[02:06:03] guilt we will protect you to the very
[02:06:05] end absurd who are you to say that she
[02:06:09] cannot be judged we are the majority and
[02:06:13] in the nation of Trials the majority is
[02:06:16] absolute Justice we we are the will of
[02:06:20] all don't let them Escape we shall keep
[02:06:22] Navia here with us Mr Malo and Mr Silver

[02:06:30] two of you possibly hope to stand

[02:08:35] saved her what a [ __ ]
[02:08:38] Chad has been so far it's just him
[02:08:41] carrying the even act four
[02:08:43] car they were defending me at some
[02:08:46] insane trial it looks like you're all
[02:08:49] right did all the sad feelings cause you
[02:08:52] to have a
[02:08:53] nightmare Bon could give you a
[02:08:58] hug the ruins you were exploring
[02:09:00] suffered a cave in when I arrived I
[02:09:02] Found You Falling toward the water this
[02:09:04] guy's literally the main character he's
[02:09:06] kind of like me actually about to be
[02:09:07] dissolved within but
[02:09:11] i d
[02:09:13] h what is it he water bended I think I
[02:09:15] saw two oids protecting you never mind
[02:09:18] oh my God Only For a Moment perhaps even
[02:09:20] a fraction of a second why do they make
[02:09:22] them the chance to retrieve you why did
[02:09:25] they make them the coolest characters
[02:09:27] and they kill
[02:09:28] them were it not for their intervention
[02:09:31] I would not have been able to rescue you
[02:09:33] before your Consciousness
[02:09:35] dissipated wait did you say oenid you
[02:09:39] mean like what happened with
[02:09:41] v so people that are dissolved become
[02:09:43] oceanids perhaps those two oceanids were
[02:09:46] the people you saw in your dream
[02:09:49] well okay well I guess I can't goope
[02:09:52] anymore they didn't have to protect
[02:09:55] me to think that they'd keep doing so
[02:09:58] even after
[02:10:02] death please come with
[02:10:06] me
[02:10:09] no nette are you
[02:10:13] okay oh I am quite all right perhaps
[02:10:17] there's something we could chat about
[02:10:19] why do you look so stiff all of a sudden
[02:10:22] oh Pon knows here that Tai poo feels
[02:10:24] awkward when there's nothing to talk
[02:10:25] about I merely thought that we should
[02:10:27] give Navia some time to herself huh why
[02:10:31] didn't you just say so then don't you
[02:10:33] think it's even Mora
[02:10:35] H I suppose so by the way Siege ween
[02:10:39] sensor regards ah Siege ween I hope all
[02:10:42] is well with her these days her work in
[02:10:44] the Fortress of meped has not been too
[02:10:46] much for her has it no way don't worry
[02:10:50] she's doing fine I see well that is good
[02:10:54] I have always worried that seen would
[02:10:56] need a lot of time to understand the
[02:10:57] world of humanity just as I have oh and
[02:11:02] the Duke also says hi even though SE Dre
[02:11:05] made him do that he hopes that you
[02:11:07] haven't been overwhelmed by all that's
[02:11:08] happened
[02:11:10] lately thank you I have indeed been busy
[02:11:13] lately and I also hope that everything
[02:11:15] is going well in the Fortress of meped
[02:11:18] okay he still doesn't know what to talk
[02:11:21] about uh let's chat about something else
[02:11:24] then so
[02:11:27] net uh you're probably the swimmer
[02:11:32] huh yes of course D he's an
[02:11:36] otter this isn't going

[02:11:43] how did you find these ruins did the
[02:11:45] Nave tell you yes in fact
[02:11:48] I had arranged to meet you in pan but
[02:11:50] when I arrived I discovered that the
[02:11:52] foule were helping the residents
[02:11:54] evacuate they had even transported a
[02:11:56] large quantity of supplies to the area
[02:11:59] amid my astonishment I ran into the Nave
[02:12:02] and we had a chat she informed me that
[02:12:05] she had asked you to investigate the
[02:12:06] ancient ruins here yeah we originally
[02:12:09] planned to meet up with you but we
[02:12:11] thought you might arino kind of carried
[02:12:13] but also I don't know why Navia even
[02:12:14] came with us like I guess she wanted to
[02:12:16] distract herself but like bro thought
[02:12:18] you'd wrap things up so quickly surely
[02:12:19] we knew about the primordial sea I hope
[02:12:22] Navia can get back on her
[02:12:26] feet love is destructive why was that
[02:12:28] wait not here anymore I'm sorry to have
[02:12:30] kept you all waiting like that I'm

[02:13:58] moment take it
[02:14:04] easy yeah lament lament sorry he said
[02:14:09] the
[02:14:15] line oh wait there's a [ __ ] R guard
[02:14:20] yo this game sucks if I die
[02:14:28] finally dude I don't have a proper team
[02:14:30] we're playing an exploration team my
[02:14:32] sh's not geared we're literally running
[02:14:34] no what
[02:14:41] this dude my healer is literally f up
[02:14:43] it's not even on the Healer mode I'm
[02:14:45] going to change her to healer mode wait
[02:14:47] there you go
[02:14:52] this thing heals so
[02:14:57] slow whoa a
[02:15:02] dice
[02:15:13] okay no well we lost our friend quit
[02:15:18] following
[02:15:19] me I didn't miss the chest right no I
[02:15:23] didn't wait I didn't go in the
[02:15:25] downstairs oh I actually did miss a door
[02:15:28] wait was there something in the door
[02:15:30] yeah it doesn't matter whatever it's
[02:15:31] fine we speed running we're speed
[02:15:37] running whatever it's fine can we go
[02:15:40] back H it's
[02:15:46] fine
[02:15:54] looks like we've reached the
[02:15:56] end this is the place there should not
[02:15:59] be any other hidden spaces in the
[02:16:01] vicinity the path sure had some twists
[02:16:03] in turns but it turns out that this
[02:16:05] place isn't actually that
[02:16:08] big there seems to be something on the
[02:16:15] wall Stone
[02:16:19] it seems like they were put here as an
[02:16:21] offering uh looks like never the [ __ ] is
[02:16:24] that down and have a
[02:16:26] look okay perhaps we should just leave
[02:16:30] them be for
[02:16:32] now there are four locations in total
[02:16:35] but only three I've heard we got a lot
[02:16:36] of finina L of this Quest cuz so far
[02:16:37] it's been fin being like kind of cute
[02:16:40] but a failure and then nead just been
[02:16:42] carrying so I assume we're going to get
[02:16:45] that low the surrounding walls also show
[02:16:47] signs of of damage there's something
[02:16:50] written below what pman see uh reason
[02:16:55] dictates that this nation be destroyed
[02:16:58] hey we love record the history of its
[02:17:00] future it past the reason dictates that
[02:17:03] this nation should be
[02:17:04] destroyed okay it feels like someone
[02:17:07] left these slates and these words here
[02:17:09] for a purpose but does he mean that
[02:17:12] Fontaine should be
[02:17:13] destroyed that would fit the
[02:17:15] circumstances dictated by the prophecy
[02:17:17] yes indeed the Slate's contents
[02:17:20] correspond to it take the second slate
[02:17:23] for
[02:17:25] example there's a person kneeling here
[02:17:29] she seems so
[02:17:31] dedicated and there's a whole bunch of
[02:17:33] other people behind her doing the same
[02:17:36] she's facing this uh Celestia aware some
[02:17:41] kind of island in the sky and is that
[02:17:46] lady finina in the third image did the
[02:17:49] hydro archon fall into the water and is
[02:17:53] that a ring of people around her BL
[02:17:56] doesn't quite get it are they all in the
[02:17:58] water the fourth image I know this one
[02:18:02] this exactly matches the content of the
[02:18:06] prophecy the people will all be
[02:18:08] dissolved into the waters and only the
[02:18:11] hydro archon will remain weeping on her
[02:18:14] throne wait what if the font just move
[02:18:17] to like sumu like what if you just
[02:18:19] immigrate like what if you what if all
[02:18:20] of font just goes to like monat and then
[02:18:23] it's a March in
[02:18:26] monat hey a summer in sumaru hey [ __ ]
[02:18:31] the prophecy yes they do seem to
[02:18:34] match I'd rather have sumaru food I'm G
[02:18:37] be
[02:18:38] honest no disrespect to Fontan but I'm
[02:18:41] just saying I'll go to
[02:18:46] sumu
[02:18:48] celes attract them okay fight us we have
[02:18:51] [ __ ] we have [ __ ] we have plot
[02:18:53] armor but I fear I cannot easily uncover
[02:18:56] it most likely due to us missing the
[02:18:59] first slate I am very sorry don't blame
[02:19:03] yourself Mr nervet deciphering ancient
[02:19:06] stone slates isn't one of your
[02:19:08] duties the time's getting the chills
[02:19:11] just looking at these slates this says
[02:19:14] that it's the history of the future
[02:19:16] right that me the prophecy sure to come
[02:19:20] true the history of the future I really
[02:19:23] hope it doesn't mean
[02:19:25] that still pom feels like these images
[02:19:29] are kind of weird when you look at them
[02:19:34] together huh
[02:19:36] uh-oh
[02:19:39] uh-oh I get what you mean Pon the issue
[02:19:41] is the order of the third and fourth
[02:19:43] images right that's right yeah I knew
[02:19:45] that if the images are in chronological
[02:19:47] order sh at the fourth the waters
[02:19:49] drowning Fontaine come before the third
[02:19:52] where the hydro archon herself falls
[02:19:54] into the water and yet the order is
[02:19:56] reversed
[02:20:01] here the thing is also Qui aering what
[02:20:04] sin are the people in the images
[02:20:05] confessing to if we go by timing lady
[02:20:09] finina only emerges in the third image
[02:20:11] that means that the person in second we
[02:20:13] learned about that the wait what was the
[02:20:16] name I forgot the name whatever I
[02:20:17] remember they said it last chat last
[02:20:19] stream [ __ ] Last Quest aeria then aeria
[02:20:23] that's the name I had never met her but
[02:20:25] her appearance the records mind it's her
[02:20:28] the previous archon kneeling before the
[02:20:30] floating island in the skies as if
[02:20:32] confessing a sin did she herself commit
[02:20:36] that
[02:20:37] sin and if not why would she be in such
[02:20:41] a posture also I'm still wondering why
[02:20:44] these ancient stone slates are here at
[02:20:46] all judging from their
[02:20:48] contents could this place be the origin
[02:20:51] of the
[02:20:54] prophecy does that mean that someone or
[02:20:57] some people once saw these slates but
[02:21:01] who would have created these slates and
[02:21:03] left these words
[02:21:06] here what if Hut did it just to [ __ ]
[02:21:08] with you I'm sorry I'll be serious seem
[02:21:10] that any further Clues will have to come
[02:21:12] from finina in that case there's no time
[02:21:15] to lose there's nothing else to be here
[02:21:17] so wait let me look at the slates a
[02:21:19] little longer let me cook a
[02:21:21] little yeah we better get somewhere safe
[02:21:24] for
[02:21:27] now honestly who created the SL this
[02:21:29] matter the real question is whether the
[02:21:30] things will truly play out as the
[02:21:32] prophecy for Tails or not challge
[02:21:36] completed wait wait let me cook for a
[02:21:40] second okay okay
[02:21:45] kneeling a new one is born they summon
[02:21:47] they [ __ ] she was like oh my God I
[02:21:50] sinned kill me she died then a new one
[02:21:52] was born they [ __ ] CH they ritual
[02:21:54] boom finina summoned then everyone's
[02:21:57] dead she's weeping I don't
[02:22:00] know maybe it was like the new Nita you
[02:22:02] know how like how like Ruka Dada was
[02:22:04] like I
[02:22:06] in okay never scar told me to shut up
[02:22:09] I'm sorry sorry I'll stop
[02:22:16] cooking
[02:22:19] I mean this could also be finina who
[02:22:20] sinned and then something happened and
[02:22:22] she got cursed they're like [ __ ] you
[02:22:23] you're not the archon anymore I don't
[02:22:25] know it was Co it's Kobi sorry calm down
[02:22:29] I mean we just know she doesn't have a
[02:22:30] uh not Vision what's the
[02:22:33] wordi neosis we know she doesn't have
[02:22:36] that
[02:22:37] so probably something there she
[02:22:39] definitely sinned I don't know what the
[02:22:40] [ __ ] happened or maybe the other one s
[02:22:42] and cursed her it's one of the two
[02:22:44] 50/50 well if I guess I have a 50%
[02:22:46] chance of I'm going to check on what's
[02:22:48] happening with the Spina you know how it
[02:22:50] is there's some things you just need to
[02:22:52] be there for
[02:22:55] yourself sorry I was distracted you

[02:24:44] okay hello Mona you to what are you
[02:24:47] doing in
[02:24:49] [Music]
[02:24:51] Fontaine the [ __ ] child pulled up to
[02:24:54] Fontaine and then Mona where's kakomi
[02:24:59] Mona speaking of cake okay well lady Meg
[02:25:04] is tus did the Stars not tell you that
[02:25:07] we might meet seriously nobody just use
[02:25:11] as a scry glass whenever they've got
[02:25:13] time to just see who they'll meet on the
[02:25:15] road still we didn't expect to see you
[02:25:18] here uh wait you're not a fanian are you
[02:25:21] Mona well I have some business to attend
[02:25:24] to here so I booked a hotel in the city
[02:25:27] I was just out for how do you pronounce
[02:25:28] that I don't know I bumped into you
[02:25:30] quite unexpectedly if I might add why
[02:25:34] did you think I was from Fontaine though
[02:25:36] is that because majes doesn't sound
[02:25:42] surname uh yeah let's go with that well
[02:25:45] I used to have my own own surname which
[02:25:47] was well some other thing either way the
[02:25:51] old hag told me when she took me as her
[02:25:53] disciple that the first step to being a
[02:25:55] great astrologist pupil was to change
[02:25:57] that name there was nothing for it
[02:25:59] really she really is amazing at
[02:26:01] astrology so I changed my name to what
[02:26:04] it is now according to her wishes to my
[02:26:07] surprise however magistus is not the
[02:26:09] name of some ancient house or Clan uh it
[02:26:13] isn't nope although it is we getting mon
[02:26:17] place of surnames It generally just
[02:26:19] means great okay wow imagine including a
[02:26:23] Bo in your name I reckon so in any case
[02:26:27] I'd give my disciple a name like this as
[02:26:29] well if I were to take one and I may ask
[02:26:32] what your master's name is astromancer
[02:26:35] barbalo Tris
[02:26:37] magistus what whoa that's a long one my
[02:26:42] name means Mona the great astrologist as
[02:26:45] for the old hag hers is is in plain
[02:26:47] speech the Thrice as great scholar of
[02:26:50] the Stars just take it as a title
[02:26:53] specific to astrologists th is great
[02:26:56] that's so petty I know right that's just
[02:27:01] how she is she used to call herself
[02:27:04] magistus actually but when she took me
[02:27:07] in she changed her name to Tris magistus
[02:27:10] okay cool that
[02:27:13] excessive magistus is thus the calling
[02:27:16] card of our school so to speak which
[02:27:18] makes it about the same as a surname
[02:27:21] it's all right if you don't get it you
[02:27:23] can look into it further should you need
[02:27:24] to study astrology more deeply how about
[02:27:27] triple strength traveler that sounds
[02:27:30] terrible but anyway you're not fanian
[02:27:33] are you Mona you're well I was born in
[02:27:35] monstad yes my parents migrated to
[02:27:38] Dorman port and I traveled with the old
[02:27:40] hag for a while after which I settled
[02:27:42] down in monat city oh that's a good
[02:27:45] thing then at least we know you won't be
[02:27:48] dissolved by fontaine's
[02:27:49] Waters speaking of that I'm sure you're
[02:27:53] aware that a bunch of things have
[02:27:54] happened here in Fontaine right I know
[02:27:57] you're not a local but I'd avoid getting
[02:27:59] too close to any water that looks
[02:28:01] strange all the same there's something
[02:28:03] ominous about it the water I
[02:28:08] mean do you come to F because of the
[02:28:10] prophecy that was the main reason yes
[02:28:13] just a while back the steam bird invited
[02:28:16] a panel speak about the C of the
[02:28:19] prophecy as an
[02:28:20] astrologist the invitation was sent
[02:28:22] quite early on I don't think anyone
[02:28:25] expected Fontaine to be in this much
[02:28:27] trouble what do you make of that
[02:28:29] prophecy Mona just tell us what you
[02:28:32] think as an astrologist your word would
[02:28:34] go a long way to make things more
[02:28:35] certain and less scary what I can tell
[02:28:38] you is that I'm an
[02:28:40] astrologer and that this prophecy
[02:28:43] concerns the fate of Fontaine even that
[02:28:46] of all to that ascertaining this is akin
[02:28:49] to reading the fortune of the whole
[02:28:51] world I'm afraid that this is not
[02:28:54] something that just anyone can do if I
[02:28:56] could do it you would no longer call me
[02:28:58] an astrologist but a Visionary wait so
[02:29:01] what's the point of side true the
[02:29:03] prophecy is so huge and Powerful that it
[02:29:06] must surely come from a powerful
[02:29:08] Visionary its contents involveed the
[02:29:10] fate of the world disregarding it would
[02:29:13] be a mistake a visionary
[02:29:17] sounds really powerful and all but does
[02:29:19] such a person really
[02:29:20] exist of course the old hag could do it
[02:29:25] and I'd bet there are others amongst
[02:29:26] those hexen zerkal colleagues of hers
[02:29:28] who could do something
[02:29:30] similar I need to ascertain the accuracy
[02:29:33] of the prophecy could you help me get in
[02:29:35] touch with your master H are you
[02:29:40] sure wait do we get to meet mod as boss
[02:29:43] I'll help you it isn't often that I see
[02:29:45] you with such a ser serious look on your
[02:29:47] face I'll tell you once I hear back from
[02:29:50] her thanks Mona you're amazing as always
[02:29:54] oh well this is something only I can do
[02:29:57] after all so yes your Praises are quite
[02:30:00] welcome good job the greatest of
[02:30:02] astrologist for you of all the people we
[02:30:04] know you know the Stars the best indeed
[02:30:08] indeed okay that's the spirit oh sorry I
[02:30:12] came to see what all the commotion was
[02:30:14] about shut the [ __ ] up sorry do not
[02:30:17] hesitate to inform the spad rosula oh
[02:30:20] whoops guess we were getting a little

[02:30:27] any news I'll be sure to come find you
[02:30:29] to again thanks
[02:30:31] motto and there she goes quick as Rush
[02:30:34] wait how did she Dash without turning
[02:30:35] into the water like when you dash on
[02:30:37] Mona it turns into like a water pole
[02:30:38] how' she just start running without
[02:30:39] turning well we were making a Ruckus try
[02:30:42] to keep it down next time p on but we
[02:30:44] were able to recruit Mona's help didn't
[02:30:45] we our fanian friends will thank us
[02:30:50] someday she didn't Dash no but she
[02:30:52] started running it wasn't walking it
[02:30:54] actually was so fast it looked like a
[02:30:55] dash therefore oh cuz we're in Abyss to
[02:30:58] Hon oh my God it makes sense feeling
[02:31:00] kind of
[02:31:01] sleepy but it's time to get up traveler

[02:31:06] let's sleep and go see nlet thanks
[02:31:10] Pon okay go to Net's office wait can we
[02:31:14] go talk to Navia where's Navia
[02:31:17] is she in fish whatever let's just
[02:31:24] go behold you still Dash in Abyss yeah
[02:31:27] but if you dash before starting it you
[02:31:29] don't I'm pretty sure you can Dash
[02:31:31] without turning into the thing I don't I
[02:31:33] haven't played Mona in a while but I'm
[02:31:34] pretty sure you don't turn into a
[02:31:37] water if you start before uh if you dash
[02:31:40] before
[02:31:42] starting AA as well yeah I've done it
[02:31:45] with aaka mon I don't
[02:31:47] [Music]
[02:31:50] remember you're here
[02:31:54] finally uh is something
[02:31:57] wrong Miss net and Lady finina they they
[02:32:01] seem to have gotten into a dispute oh no
[02:32:03] please go see for
[02:32:06] yourself oh they're fighting
[02:32:12] no like I said I've already explained
[02:32:15] everything
[02:32:17] and yet the problem has not been
[02:32:19] properly solved there is little space
[02:32:21] for excuses between us it is not my
[02:32:24] intention to offend you but please tell
[02:32:26] me where you stand oh no you are the
[02:32:29] hydro archan falor are you not look at
[02:32:33] this this is a list of the victims from
[02:32:35] the recent pent look I love you and I
[02:32:39] love finina but just assume for the rest
[02:32:42] of this Quest it's not her fault but
[02:32:44] just assume that she's useless I don't
[02:32:46] mean it in a disrespectful manner it's
[02:32:48] probably not her fault I don't know the
[02:32:50] lore but given all the clues we have she
[02:32:52] probably can't do anything okay because
[02:32:54] why else would she act like she has a
[02:32:56] plan in front of in front of the Nave
[02:32:58] arino when she has nothing let's just
[02:33:01] listen she might listen I could be wrong
[02:33:03] I love finina I am a finina lover till
[02:33:05] the day I die okay I'm just saying for
[02:33:08] your own sake nevet just proceed
[02:33:12] alone we'll see I'm sorry we'll see you
[02:33:16] mean they're
[02:33:21] all we did not arrive in time to avert
[02:33:24] This Disaster and I will not have I
[02:33:26] don't know I assume it's not her fault
[02:33:27] there's probably going to be lore behind
[02:33:28] her but like I assume she just can't do
[02:33:30] anything but it's not her fault I will
[02:33:31] say this once more was like no one knows
[02:33:34] she can't do anything everything you
[02:33:35] know yesterday I found three stone
[02:33:38] slates in some ancient ruins near Pon do
[02:33:41] you know anything about those like arino
[02:33:43] was mean but she was kind of cooking but
[02:33:45] she was mean
[02:33:46] seriously you're questioning me like
[02:33:48] this is a court case now I don't know
[02:33:51] anything about
[02:33:53] that but you found them in some ancient
[02:33:56] ruins you say that's correct which is
[02:34:00] why I came to ask you some questions
[02:34:01] heated there should have been four
[02:34:03] slates but one of them was missing a
[02:34:05] heated rebuttal featured different
[02:34:07] images that seemed to correlate to the
[02:34:10] prophecy the
[02:34:13] prophecy the second of these slates
[02:34:16] depicts the previous Hydro archon aeria
[02:34:18] kneeling before a floating island in the
[02:34:20] sky as if confessing something do you
[02:34:23] know nothing of this either I don't I've
[02:34:26] never seen such slates I'll ask you
[02:34:29] again do you really have no information
[02:34:33] regarding the previous archon my
[02:34:36] deciphering of the slates indicates that
[02:34:38] the hydro archon aeria once had to
[02:34:40] confess to or apologize for a certain
[02:34:43] sin if anyone would know about it it
[02:34:46] should be you all gods don't have the
[02:34:49] same secrets you know she was herself
[02:34:52] and I'm me is it really so strange that
[02:34:55] I know nothing I understand your
[02:34:58] concerns but I'm sorry I just don't have
[02:35:02] anything to tell
[02:35:03] you dude if I'm never let I'm
[02:35:08] pissed imagine you're you're you're
[02:35:10] [ __ ] now lady finina but I have long
[02:35:13] known of your various secret
[02:35:14] investigations into certain
[02:35:17] matters dude imagine your Aron your
[02:35:19] whole nation's going to like die by
[02:35:21] Drowning to a prophecy and your archon I
[02:35:24] guess maybe I mean we'll see or you're
[02:35:26] literally your archon's like yeah I
[02:35:28] don't know anything there are several
[02:35:29] indications and you're a [ __ ] Hydro
[02:35:31] Dragon that's just saving everyone this
[02:35:33] is not strange in itself considering
[02:35:36] that you are the hydro archon but it is
[02:35:39] strange that you should also claim to
[02:35:40] not know any of aia's Secrets as well as
[02:35:43] do nothing following your inquiries
[02:35:46] you have never been as superficial as
[02:35:48] you have presented I know she's trying
[02:35:50] though nor are you a fool and yet your
[02:35:54] behavior is very inconsistent
[02:36:01] true so you've been watching me all this
[02:36:03] time have you I didn't think you were
[02:36:06] that tight he's a tier three sub Fino he
[02:36:07] watches your streams you wait well since
[02:36:10] you know about my secret
[02:36:13] investigations know I'm actually working
[02:36:15] to take care of it there's no point
[02:36:19] questioning me you're the udx but you're
[02:36:22] still my subordinate you should be
[02:36:24] following my lead just trust in me
[02:36:27] you're archon and do as I say never mind
[02:36:30] whether you can truly convince yourself
[02:36:32] to or not it'll all turn out
[02:36:35] fine yeah I don't know about that one
[02:36:37] for that's all I have to say we do not
[02:36:41] discuss this matter again y
[02:36:44] yo
[02:36:48] oh the Opera is about to start
[02:36:51] toles bro if I'm theet I quit [ __ ] it
[02:36:55] bro [ __ ] it I just saved the whole
[02:36:57] nation I saved I saved your [ __ ]
[02:36:59] General and I saved
[02:37:03] everyone [ __ ] this I'm going to [ __ ]
[02:37:05] mon notice us standing by the door
[02:37:09] wonder what's up with her she was
[02:37:12] smiling huh she didn't seem in the mood
[02:37:15] to car if we were listening in or not
[02:37:17] she seems deeply troubled she seems to
[02:37:19] be deliberately hiding
[02:37:23] something I assume you've been outside
[02:37:25] for a while now oh you noticed seems
[02:37:30] finina didn't even realize we were
[02:37:32] here she was in a great Panic though I
[02:37:35] cannot discern the reason our discussion
[02:37:38] reached impasses time and again okay
[02:37:40] okay I'm sorry not to break immersion
[02:37:43] I'm sorry I don't want to break
[02:37:45] immersion but first time chatter King
[02:37:49] gamer11 says is it just me or are there
[02:37:52] no actual ladies on genin bro what yo yo
[02:37:57] what are you saying have you not seen
[02:38:00] like half the genin characters I'm sorry
[02:38:02] I'm sorry let me keep going let's not
[02:38:04] get distra I'm sorry I please look up in
[02:38:07] your Google search bar look up uh b b e
[02:38:10] i d o u uh also you can look up uh y y a
[02:38:15] e SP m i k actually look up Electro
[02:38:18] characters if you want uh all of them or
[02:38:20] most of them uh you could also look up
[02:38:22] uh uh if you look up the well you can
[02:38:24] look up
[02:38:25] arino uh DEA
[02:38:35] yolan anyways uh I I missed a bit of
[02:38:38] what he said in great Panic though I
[02:38:39] cannot discern the reason our discussion
[02:38:40] reached imp passes this time time and
[02:38:42] time and again a state of affairs we
[02:38:44] cannot allow to continue still I do not
[02:38:47] understand dialogue is the basis for
[02:38:49] understanding so why did she keep
[02:38:51] refusing to engage true I'm uh afraid
[02:38:55] questions alone might not suffice we
[02:38:57] need to make her understand how dire the
[02:38:59] situation is everyone in her Inner
[02:39:01] Circle has noticed that she is hiding
[02:39:03] some secret the issue is her attitude so
[02:39:06] too true I fear that she will not reveal
[02:39:08] anything unless absolutely forced
[02:39:10] to okay we may have to create a
[02:39:14] situation in which she will have no no
[02:39:15] choice but to speak oh like what
[02:39:21] normally people will only reveal the
[02:39:22] truth when standing trial perhaps we
[02:39:25] must have the hydro experience just such
[02:39:29] a scenario no I mean you should I agree
[02:39:31] but she's going to cry you're going to
[02:39:33] put on trial you're going to embarrass
[02:39:34] her in front of everyone she's going to
[02:39:35] admit the truth she's going to cry and
[02:39:36] then everyone's going to be sad the
[02:39:38] end I'll shut
[02:39:41] up we will need to consider this
[02:39:43] thoroughly join forces with various
[02:39:45] parties
[02:39:46] and then do what we
[02:39:49] can if at all possible I would prefer to
[02:39:52] recuse myself from this affair but we
[02:39:55] must prevent the prophecy yeah literally
[02:39:56] she's going to reveal everything it's
[02:39:57] going to be sad she's going to start
[02:39:58] crying then like it's going to be like
[02:40:00] she'll be like I hate you net then we're
[02:40:02] going to leave the Opera and then it's
[02:40:03] going to start raining like and pon pon
[02:40:06] dumbass be like it must be the Hydro
[02:40:08] Dragon sorry her but all Fontaine is in
[02:40:12] crisis the information a god possesses
[02:40:15] is too too precious and so we must take
[02:40:17] a chance on this in this case we will
[02:40:19] need
[02:40:20] help but who will lend us their aid to
[02:40:23] do such a
[02:40:24] thing oh I know who to
[02:40:30] call oh PA [ __ ] who do we call
[02:40:34] Shia clarent Navia
[02:40:38] rizzly saw
[02:40:41] Goodman speaking of which it was pretty
[02:40:43] smart of you to think of hiding here
[02:40:48] involved in a
[02:40:49] disaster devoid of people and here you
[02:40:52] are it's the most natural thing in the
[02:40:54] world huh that's what family should do
[02:40:58] sit and enjoy a leisurely time together
[02:41:01] true it's nice to enjoy tea here you
[02:41:04] know care for a
[02:41:06] cup lend
[02:41:10] everyone or perhaps one of you might
[02:41:13] like to start us off how about you
[02:41:16] friend oh there he is hello NAIA
[02:41:19] me no I don't think I
[02:41:23] can then how about you good

[02:41:31] this boat to become as somber as it is
[02:41:33] in court D well then I guess we're lucky
[02:41:37] we've got a local like me to organize
[02:41:39] things wonderful the spotlight At Last I
[02:41:43] guess I'll be facilitating things from
[02:41:45] here
[02:41:46] here that was a little longwinded don't
[02:41:48] you think hello oh you might be right
[02:41:52] anyway to cut to the chase our friend
[02:41:55] here the traveler has brought us
[02:41:57] together to discuss something
[02:42:00] hey as for what that is well let's start
[02:42:04] by saying that we'll be pulling our
[02:42:05] efforts together to create a series of
[02:42:09] traps oh how
[02:42:12] intriguing well it's just an exp ex
[02:42:15] really one that I just learned from
[02:42:17] chlorin wait why'd you learn an
[02:42:18] expression from Chlor so let's invite
[02:42:21] her to explain in detail a round of
[02:42:24] applause
[02:42:26] please that's
[02:42:29] suspicious huh didn't you say that you
[02:42:33] would be facilitating this oh come now
[02:42:36] your work doesn't involve much public
[02:42:38] speaking right this is a good chance
[02:42:41] to you might even pick up some fancy
[02:42:44] oratory tricks your hats are literally
[02:42:46] touching back
[02:42:47] up I see and what does my boss
[02:42:52] say he is glad that you consider him
[02:42:55] your boss do go
[02:43:06] on in that
[02:43:08] case do any of you have experience
[02:43:11] hunting not that I recall frem and I
[02:43:14] once used a wouldn't stick in a basket
[02:43:16] to catch wild rabbits when we were
[02:43:18] younger as for Lynette um oh right you
[02:43:23] were sick that day weren't you uh I've
[02:43:26] also Gone Diving to catch some fish
[02:43:28] before uh does so G sorry I afraid not
[02:43:35] you may or may not have heard but
[02:43:37] Fontaine once played host to a group
[02:43:39] known as The marose Hunters
[02:43:42] Mar they did not hunt animals but rather
[02:43:45] various monsters left behind by the
[02:43:47] ancient dynasty of King Remis dude no
[02:43:50] way fontaine's monster population has
[02:43:52] already thinned greatly so the hunters
[02:43:55] have Blended back into society taking up
[02:43:57] arms in other lines of work they even
[02:44:00] left a unique methodology of hunting in
[02:44:02] their wake a trap comprises of the
[02:44:05] following bait a trigger and a
[02:44:09] containment
[02:44:10] device sometimes a lethal Implement will
[02:44:12] also be necessary to deal with the prey
[02:44:14] so
[02:44:15] if we were to build a trap together
[02:44:17] right now what would you choose to build
[02:44:20] it with for me I would prefer something
[02:44:24] basket shaped pigeons and rabbits will
[02:44:27] see the bait and naturally enter the
[02:44:29] snare our line of work requires a DEA
[02:44:32] hand and we're some of the best in the
[02:44:35] industry so you can count on our
[02:44:38] techniques you use some of those
[02:44:40] techniques while moving the people of
[02:44:41] Pon didn't you my subordinates mentioned
[02:44:44] that you even wait so we have to design
[02:44:46] a trap children yes what if we manage to
[02:44:49] gather some intelligence in the metime
[02:44:51] what if we do we take a character we
[02:44:53] take an attractive character and then in
[02:44:55] order for f to get baited we make it to
[02:44:58] where the character you can get them but
[02:45:00] you have to spend a currency we're going
[02:45:01] to call these currencies uh uh H uh Brio
[02:45:04] bems and in order to get them you have
[02:45:06] to spend you have to either play all day
[02:45:08] or spend real life money and then you
[02:45:11] will fall into the trap looking for the
[02:45:14] one character you want and end up in cap
[02:45:16] in the Whirl poool of the gacha system
[02:45:19] sorry I'm afraid I can't claim that as
[02:45:22] my strong suit I prefer more stable
[02:45:26] methods like placing bait in the water
[02:45:29] and waiting for the fish to come within
[02:45:32] reach that's the kind of method I would
[02:45:35] count
[02:45:36] on calm and steady exactly the kind of
[02:45:40] and I can be their
[02:45:42] assistant with discretion I'm sure
[02:45:46] huh I'd probably use some sort of
[02:45:48] mechanical animal Papa once bought me
[02:45:51] some small Clockwork squirrels mice and
[02:45:53] such when placed in the forest they can
[02:45:55] attract others of their kind I remember
[02:45:58] that you like those too didn't
[02:46:01] you I did and that would be a good way
[02:46:04] to go about it if they're realistic
[02:46:06] enough animals of the same kind will
[02:46:09] follow them all the way to the Trap what
[02:46:11] about you miss
[02:46:13] net I fear I do not have any related
[02:46:16] experience oh he's literally an otter
[02:46:18] that makes sense you usually solve
[02:46:21] problems directly without the use of any
[02:46:23] such tricks but I do have one more
[02:46:25] question for you
[02:46:27] miss if we were to create a trap now how
[02:46:31] would you design
[02:46:32] it I would like for it to be effective
[02:46:35] but bring no harm to the prey a more
[02:46:39] gentle makes the soundboard louder dude
[02:46:41] the problem with my soundboard is the
[02:46:42] time talk about it however intention
[02:46:45] doesn't necessarily change the [ __ ] yes
[02:46:47] it is I hear it really loud but you guys
[02:46:49] don't so if I make it louder it destroys
[02:46:50] my ears and there I don't know what to
[02:46:51] do about
[02:46:53] it anyways let's keep
[02:46:57] going if we wanted to kill the prey in
[02:47:00] one strike we would need a powerful
[02:47:02] Implement however that also goes for
[02:47:05] prey that must be captured and safely
[02:47:07] contained wait why is that only a hunter
[02:47:12] who's a true expert at subduing their
[02:47:14] prey can
[02:47:15] am I [ __ ] stupid I just realized
[02:47:17] they're talking about like luring finina
[02:47:19] I just realized they're doing all this
[02:47:20] for fin am I stupid this will be like 20
[02:47:22] minutes I'm
[02:47:24] stupid so are we going hunting together
[02:47:28] I was
[02:47:30] like we hadn't thought of seeing
[02:47:32] ourselves as Hunters it kind of works
[02:47:35] but maybe it's still not the best
[02:47:38] metaphor if our means of capturing and
[02:47:40] dealing with our prey is to put them on
[02:47:42] trial and the hunting metaphor is
[02:47:44] actually actually quite accurate at
[02:47:46] least I said it before much more courage
[02:47:48] than any hunter to judge a god a being
[02:47:51] whose seat is an exalted Throne that's
[02:47:54] right oh so that's what's going on
[02:47:57] sounds very
[02:48:00] interesting Florence hunting metaphor
[02:48:02] was just that a metaphor okay I can
[02:48:03] click to continue thank God was just
[02:48:05] that a metaphor you will not call this a
[02:48:06] hunt because that is not what you should
[02:48:08] do at the present nor has the
[02:48:09] relationship between you and finina
[02:48:11] reached such a dire stage first of all
[02:48:14] who who the [ __ ] is talking to us right
[02:48:16] now is this D's
[02:48:18] Leaf no it's not what you need is simply
[02:48:20] the secrets she is keeping attempting to
[02:48:23] take Secrets is an act of sacriligious
[02:48:26] disrespect but must be done to prevent
[02:48:29] Fontan from sinking into the waters as
[02:48:31] foretold in the
[02:48:33] prophecy this is neither Hunter nor prey
[02:48:37] there is neither Hunter nor prey but
[02:48:39] there must be a trap this is what you
[02:48:41] will
[02:48:43] need Mar sh
[02:48:46] Hunter wait can I talk to someone here
[02:48:48] where am I am I on the boat we're going
[02:48:51] on a trip in my favorite rocket ship to

[02:50:11] go on for so long but everyone seemed
[02:50:13] pretty fired up huh
[02:50:15] Pon thought they'd be at least a little
[02:50:17] frightened well F was now that Pon
[02:50:20] thinks about it but everyone else just
[02:50:22] looked a little more conf after the
[02:50:23] meetings Pon uh well it's hard to say
[02:50:26] Pon doesn't have any experience with
[02:50:28] this sort of thing but with you around

[02:52:16] true the prophecy yes what has been
[02:52:20] prophesized will be fulfilled you may
[02:52:23] view such things as the history of the
[02:52:26] future
[02:52:27] what why did she say future like she's
[02:52:29] like future it I believe you have
[02:52:32] witnessed a failed attempt with your own
[02:52:35] eyes can everything inat so easily be

[02:52:42] really be no exceptions ah ah so you've

[02:52:53] in this game yet be happening in Hidden
[02:52:55] Corners where the God's gaze does not

[02:53:22] that you understand right some things

[02:54:50] account soon we're going to do all the
[02:54:51] quests again uh because uh we're going
[02:54:53] to have a second account true how have
[02:54:54] you been the past few days mono fine
[02:54:56] just fine I went to take part in that
[02:54:59] steam bird panel it turned out to be
[02:55:01] more interesting than I expected mention
[02:55:05] the Carri bear Quest I remember all of
[02:55:07] car bear like my favorite quest one
[02:55:08] Journal mentioned that sitting around
[02:55:10] and waiting for the end to come would be
[02:55:12] wrong and that they should make their
[02:55:13] own resue preparations I agreed so we
[02:55:16] had a brief chat with her uh did she
[02:55:20] have pink hair by any chance why yes it
[02:55:23] was Charlotte you remember her right
[02:55:26] that Daredevil
[02:55:28] journalist I'm in full support of her
[02:55:31] view prophecies are very important but
[02:55:34] how can people allow their lives to be
[02:55:36] commandeered by just a few
[02:55:38] words that's right P's glad to hear
[02:55:41] something sensible for
[02:55:43] once
[02:55:44] ah yes about what we had discussed
[02:55:47] before I did try but I'm afraid I
[02:55:50] couldn't reach the old hag I'll try
[02:55:52] again tonight but I wouldn't get your
[02:55:54] hopes up actually someone already came
[02:55:56] over huh huh sorry you tell Mona about
[02:56:01] your mysterious
[02:56:02] guest goodness gracious are you serious
[02:56:06] I believe she came to pass a message to
[02:56:08] us she said that even the God's gate has
[02:56:11] blind spots pretty buold if you ask p
[02:56:14] most people would believe the gods to be
[02:56:16] all knowing right the hexen circle
[02:56:19] members are certainly anything but
[02:56:21] ordinary as for the Mage named n the old
[02:56:24] hag has mentioned her a few times she
[02:56:27] said why she sound more British now I
[02:56:29] just not notice it Inc and that she
[02:56:31] loves guiding those who are
[02:56:33] lost but I've never met her and if she
[02:56:36] were still alive she'd be well suffice
[02:56:40] it to say that the hag's at least a few
[02:56:42] hundred now and n's been around for
[02:56:44] longer than that whoa the hexen circle
[02:56:48] sounds like a scary group but they must
[02:56:51] really stay in shap to live so long
[02:56:54] their abilities alone are pretty
[02:56:56] terrifying if she came to see you
[02:56:58] personally then the problem you're
[02:57:00] facing must truly be of great
[02:57:02] importance well it's not like Pon could
[02:57:05] understand anything she
[02:57:07] said
[02:57:08] transatlantic but I suspect she means
[02:57:11] that there is still a way to turn things
[02:57:13] around hey good for Atlantic didn't say
[02:57:15] when or what that would be though so
[02:57:18] that's
[02:57:19] awesome okay Perhaps it is something
[02:57:22] that you cannot know right
[02:57:25] now true her words meant uh as a helpful
[02:57:28] hint but when will they realize
[02:57:30] that what was the best answer that my
[02:57:32] question could have gotten or sorry was
[02:57:34] that the best answer that my question
[02:57:35] could have gotten traveler P are you two
[02:57:39] all right oh we're fine we're just a
[02:57:42] little down right now
[02:57:44] it kind of feels like the end is coming
[02:57:47] you know I see I feel the end is of
[02:57:51] desperation
[02:57:55] [Applause]
[02:58:00] too the end is coming sorry I had PTSD
[02:58:03] from that I guess you could consider me
[02:58:06] someone who has often witnessed fate so
[02:58:09] far as I have seen it cannot be
[02:58:11] swayed but even so
[02:58:14] I still hope for and Believe In
[02:58:18] Miracles astrology is eternal and
[02:58:21] rational but fate may not be it is cruel
[02:58:26] but it can also be beautiful so speaking
[02:58:30] was trying to tell you not to lose heart
[02:58:33] and to believe that what you are seeing
[02:58:35] playing out before you is not yet set in
[02:58:38] stone I did originally think of steering
[02:58:40] clear of all this but I couldn't even if
[02:58:44] this is all futile I still wish to help
[02:58:46] everyone if we don't struggle to the
[02:58:48] last then how can we Face the end when
[02:58:50] it comes the end sorry you do have a
[02:58:55] point there I go talking about
[02:58:57] astrological principles again sorry
[02:59:00] about that the moment I start talking
[02:59:02] about work rated stuff oh I need to get
[02:59:06] going don't worry about it Mona thank
[02:59:07] you it was worth trying to comfort you
[02:59:09] even if only a little I believe that
[02:59:12] you'll help those who are struggling in
[02:59:13] the same way I did thanks mon if you
[02:59:16] ever need that might be why we always
[02:59:18] seem to meet by
[02:59:21] coincidence I mean was it really
[02:59:23] coincidence she feel kind of I mean I
[02:59:25] guess it was she didn't know we were
[02:59:26] here but also kind of sad too hey

[03:00:54] looking when Caesar before long I had to
[03:00:56] pull a who the [ __ ] is

[03:01:18] yeah this the right Quest let pman see
[03:01:21] the underwater stronghold The Fortress
[03:01:23] of meped has continued in its Noble
[03:01:25] autonomy but that does not mean that
[03:01:28] others cannot interact with it my recent
[03:01:30] attempts to enter the Fortress bore
[03:01:32] little fruit huh guess Charlotte still
[03:01:35] hasn't given up on that thus did an
[03:01:37] Outlander friend become the focus of
[03:01:39] this report a blonded furer with their
[03:01:42] white fairy Legend trailing in their
[03:01:44] wake it is said that this mysterious
[03:01:47] traveler once visited the underwater
[03:01:49] Fortress so while the Fortress Is
[03:01:51] interior remains a mystery behind closed
[03:01:53] doors do not fear for the tales of the
[03:01:56] journalist Charlotte's biggest scoop H
[03:01:59] Charlotte took so many she hasn't been
[03:02:00] able to get a hold of anything at the
[03:02:02] Fortress so since we're easier to find
[03:02:04] she's using us at the seriously wait is

[03:10:13] wow if it isn't the traveler and
[03:10:16] Pon article I wrote about you yeah but
[03:10:19] sounds cooler you got some nerve you
[03:10:22] just used death to make some quick MOA
[03:10:25] can we negotiate a profit split oh you
[03:10:26] needn't worry about that I heard that
[03:10:28] you were in pant some time back so I
[03:10:30] sent you a letter to discuss just that
[03:10:33] it appears you didn't receive it though
[03:10:35] it's all right though I've set aside the
[03:10:36] amount intended for you I've even set
[03:10:38] the table with some
[03:10:40] food really
[03:10:43] you're almost a little too easy to win
[03:10:45] over Pimon if I were a journalist with
[03:10:47] ulterior motives you'd be in trouble now
[03:10:50] you know oh P knows you're not like this
[03:10:53] still what brings you here all of a
[03:10:54] sudden when Mona mentioned you we
[03:10:56] thought of coming to see you at work I
[03:10:59] see it seems you've already bumped into
[03:11:00] Mona here in Fontaine so she mentioned
[03:11:03] me what did she say she said that you're
[03:11:06] a real Dar jabel of a
[03:11:10] journalist nice in which case can this
[03:11:13] Daredevil journalist dare to request an
[03:11:15] exclusive interview with the legendary
[03:11:17] traveler and Pon no h so your article in
[03:11:21] the paper today doesn't count oh of
[03:11:23] course it doesn't that was more like
[03:11:26] live photography wait oh that was this
[03:11:27] Quest I thought that was part of L's
[03:11:29] Quest my bad seen and experience you
[03:11:32] seriously want to interview me yeah are
[03:11:33] we even qualified
[03:11:36] enough why not if I say you're worth an
[03:11:38] interview then you're worth it but not
[03:11:41] right now of course I'll need a few days
[03:11:43] to prepare try order food chat it's 2
[03:11:45] a.m. is there even anything open around
[03:11:47] me like everything closes
[03:11:49] here so that's a yes there's literally
[03:11:52] like nothing spend I'll tell the editor
[03:11:54] and chief immediately I'll have to apply
[03:11:56] for lighting props
[03:11:59] and so much to get done now talk to you
[03:12:06] later wait Charlotte pman still got a
[03:12:08] question for
[03:12:10] you H and what's that
[03:12:14] if just for example Fontaine were to be
[03:12:17] flooded
[03:12:19] tomorrow dude shut the [ __ ]
[03:12:22] sorry huh that's the prophecy you're
[03:12:24] talking about isn't it I mean I do hear
[03:12:27] about it often but I've never once
[03:12:29] thought that the day could be
[03:12:31] tomorrow if you're seriously asking then
[03:12:33] I might try and think of a way to leave
[03:12:36] Fontaine oh but I'm still a journalist
[03:12:38] first and foremost that means I have a
[03:12:40] duty to be reporting from the scene and
[03:12:42] secondly I wouldn't forsake my homeland
[03:12:45] that easily from what I've seen most
[03:12:48] people don't know what they' do should
[03:12:49] the worst come to pass in truth it might
[03:12:52] be better just to behave like normal
[03:12:54] rather than worry over such an end so in
[03:12:56] all likelihood I'd probably still be
[03:12:59] prepping at the office for That
[03:13:00] interview of ours that is a good answer
[03:13:01] I know what you're thinking that sounds
[03:13:03] a bit sad but I've always believed that
[03:13:05] it's best to do what you enjoy just
[03:13:08] think about it if this nation really
[03:13:10] were to be suddenly destroyed tomorrow
[03:13:12] but I still sucess an exclusive
[03:13:14] interview with a truly unique person
[03:13:17] that the story I would wind up writing
[03:13:19] would truly be timeless and then do you
[03:13:21] know what I'd do well I'd write that
[03:13:23] story send it for printing and use
[03:13:25] messenger pigeons to get copies out to
[03:13:27] the various Nations as soon as possible
[03:13:30] I'm not a dreamer nor am I a workaholic
[03:13:32] but I do love my job this is cool I kind
[03:13:34] of don't care I'm going to be honest but
[03:13:35] like insirational behind so true I guess
[03:13:38] but anyway that's my answer and on that
[03:13:41] note I'll get back to my prep operations
[03:13:45] cool that's so nice anyway let's go and
[03:13:49] take a look at the sea shall
[03:13:53] we
[03:13:56] okay shit's about to go down by the way
[03:13:58] I like when we do like 30 minutes of
[03:14:00] talking to random people just for like a
[03:14:01] bunch of [ __ ] to go down and then six
[03:14:03] people
[03:14:05] die's been thinking no don't think Pon
[03:14:08] if it wasn't Fontaine but all of tat
[03:14:11] that would be destroyed tomorrow
[03:14:13] where would we go and what would we do
[03:14:16] no Pon should ask if you really Pon if
[03:14:20] all of tavat was destroyed what would we
[03:14:22] do p if all of tavat is destroyed I
[03:14:24] won't be here
[03:14:29] sorry Sly trying to consider what to do
[03:14:32] point of this we've always been moving
[03:14:33] to the next destination so we haven't
[03:14:35] spent much time thinking about these
[03:14:37] kinds of things we didn't have to either
[03:14:40] with us always being on the road and
[03:14:42] whatnot
[03:14:43] until that until that moment comes I
[03:14:45] think I'll keep on journeying on let's
[03:14:47] Journey starward starward star traveling
[03:14:51] yes cherish every moment I that I have
[03:14:53] to look upon this
[03:14:55] world wait isn't that what we've always
[03:14:58] been
[03:14:59] doing the ban goes back and forth
[03:15:01] between two as the Time Slips By Night
[03:15:03] Falls you return your to your
[03:15:05] accommodations and end this busy
[03:15:09] day the next few days are just as calm
[03:15:12] Charlotte comes to find you and conducts
[03:15:14] the interview in the Spina D rosula safe
[03:15:17] house at
[03:15:18] flound Navia having finished her
[03:15:20] business in PUO even drops by to take a
[03:15:23] photo with the two of you all goes well
[03:15:26] all is well Clarin then comes over says
[03:15:29] Hey traveler are you that one streamer
[03:15:32] I'm a big
[03:15:35] fan feels like he'll grow mold if you
[03:15:38] stay here long enough but it's still
[03:15:40] better than the Fortress of meped that's
[03:15:42] for for sure it's not only so the two of
[03:15:45] you are still here wow Isadora oh you're
[03:15:49] from theonia aren't you yes I'm Isadora
[03:15:53] M NAD sent me to look for you two before
[03:15:56] I heard that afterward you went to the
[03:15:57] Fortress of Mero you think we're
[03:15:59] criminals not at all I'm well aware that
[03:16:02] your friends of happen yes inside the
[03:16:05] Opera House the Mari chose Phantom has
[03:16:08] declared the incident a smallscale riot
[03:16:11] a riot well that said I don't personally
[03:16:15] think it was that serious lady finina
[03:16:18] was watching a performance at the opera
[03:16:20] house and while she was resting during
[03:16:22] an intermission some other audience
[03:16:24] members suddenly started harassing her
[03:16:27] loudly accusing her of doing nothing
[03:16:30] prophecy crisis and before she could
[03:16:33] other to join
[03:16:37] in okay added
[03:16:41] riot
[03:16:43] me refresh
[03:16:47] chat the crowd continued to grow in
[03:16:49] protest against the hydro archon started
[03:16:52] to break out so people have started to
[03:16:55] put the blame on finina guess they
[03:16:57] finally found an outlet for the pressure
[03:16:59] they've I can't hoo that's
[03:17:01] [ __ ] I agree people will naturally
[03:17:04] rely on gods as is customary but the
[03:17:07] moment people feel threatened gods are
[03:17:10] also the first to be blamed so what
[03:17:13] happened after that is finina okay
[03:17:15] seeing that the situation was spiraling
[03:17:17] out of control in that spiral Abyss
[03:17:20] pointless she claimed that she'd gotten
[03:17:22] tired of this and left in a hurry the
[03:17:25] marish Phantom had their hands full
[03:17:27] maintaining order and did not catch
[03:17:29] where lady finina had gone only when
[03:17:32] things had stabilized did we realized
[03:17:33] that she had gone missing so wait a
[03:17:36] second you mean she's still missing how
[03:17:38] do we let fin go missing that's right
[03:17:41] the mar say has dispatched many people
[03:17:43] to search for her but we don't have any
[03:17:46] leads yet that said I don't think
[03:17:49] there's much to worry about she is a God
[03:17:52] after all even if she were to fall into
[03:17:54] the hands of riers what could ordinary
[03:17:57] people do to her but she almost died to
[03:17:58] arino like 5 days ago what do you mean
[03:18:00] what could ordinary literally anyone bro
[03:18:03] it's finina find her what the [ __ ] she
[03:18:05] should be literally locked in her room
[03:18:07] literally nlet has to have her if I say
[03:18:10] on a Le you guys will take it in a weird
[03:18:11] way net literally should have his eye on
[03:18:13] her 24/7 we can't lose our [ __ ]
[03:18:15] archon cuz she got kidnapped by arlino
[03:18:18] while she was chasing a
[03:18:20] cat I understand the situation good M
[03:18:24] nerved sent me to tell you about the
[03:18:25] situation but he didn't say anything
[03:18:28] else don't worry this is more than
[03:18:31] enough to go on thanks for keeping us
[03:18:34] informed is that so well all right then
[03:18:38] in that case Okay CH I'm ordering ptin
[03:18:39] [ __ ] it it'll be here in 40 minutes I'm
[03:18:41] hungry now but I don't want to eat while
[03:18:44] doing the quest but I'll have it for
[03:18:45] after cuz everything closes and I don't
[03:18:46] feel like cooking at 4:00 a.m. by time
[03:18:48] I'm done sounds like we should hurry
[03:18:49] over to put Sal
[03:18:53] in you sure caught on quickly if we know
[03:18:56] finina she won't try to fix things in
[03:18:58] this situation you're going to save food
[03:19:00] for 4 hours I mean look for a place to
[03:19:02] wait out the heat I guess I might eat
[03:19:04] mid I don't know I'm just going to order
[03:19:05] it she may be loud and dramatic but she
[03:19:08] doesn't have a Heart of
[03:19:11] Stone

[03:19:15] meronia and she heard about P she
[03:19:18] couldn't hide her sadness and
[03:19:21] remorse it would be hard for her to
[03:19:23] ignore being accused by the public Pon
[03:19:26] thinks fina's probably taking the
[03:19:28] opportunity to slip away to p and try to
[03:19:31] relieve the sense of guilt that she's
[03:19:33] feeling H well what do you think Pon

[03:22:05] archon I must teach them a
[03:22:10] lesson I can just imagine their twisted
[03:22:12] and frustrated faces once they realize

[03:25:13] flooding in Pon didn't
[03:25:16] it it can't be it's happening again well
[03:25:21] there's no need to worry too much about
[03:25:22] that nolet's made some emergency plans
[03:25:25] so the evacuation should go a lot
[03:25:27] smoother this time bro at at a certain
[03:25:28] point when we go to save every [ __ ]
[03:25:30] region from their archon or the prophecy
[03:25:33] or the [ __ ] the the Tor like at some
[03:25:35] point we can just be like look look I'm
[03:25:37] a traveler I'm just here for tourism I'm
[03:25:39] out like why do we have to solve Every
[03:25:42] Nation I'm sorry yeah keep playing I
[03:25:45] hope you're
[03:25:46] right but the people of P leave
[03:25:52] already has finina finally reached her
[03:25:55] limit now that she's talking about her
[03:25:57] actual feelings she's starting to look
[03:25:59] far less Stiff The Jig Is up you be to
[03:26:02] talk Among Us yourselves for fre call
[03:26:06] I've been investigating the prophecy for
[03:26:08] hundreds of years I once had in
[03:26:11] performance all over to vat searching
[03:26:13] for Clues and feeding information back
[03:26:16] to me I've tried all kinds of ways too
[03:26:19] to hold back the sea anything to keep
[03:26:22] the coastline from advancing but all my
[03:26:25] efforts prove to be futile in the end
[03:26:29] really the truth has been clear to me
[03:26:31] for a very long time we cannot make an
[03:26:35] enemy of the Divine no matter what we do
[03:26:39] the will of the Heavenly principles will
[03:26:41] happen have its way and the prophecy
[03:26:43] shall be fulfilled stop and get it up
[03:26:46] right give
[03:26:49] up I do love the sound of that phrase it
[03:26:53] would mean finally coming to terms with
[03:26:55] fate but also for me to finally be free
[03:27:00] but that would also mean that all hope
[03:27:02] would disappear and we must hold on to
[03:27:04] hope for I've thought about giving up so
[03:27:08] many times especially after we almost l
[03:27:12] p fate is really unreasonable isn't it
[03:27:16] it has no heart and obeys no rules the
[03:27:20] prophecy has only just started to come
[03:27:23] true and so many people have already
[03:27:26] lost their lives wait a second so we're
[03:27:29] beefing with Celestia right because of
[03:27:31] the prophecy okay and we're getting Chev
[03:27:33] next patch and Chev is is has a musket
[03:27:36] and she's America she represents America
[03:27:38] which means we're getting America Next
[03:27:40] patch
[03:27:42] so hypothetically couldn't we just nuke
[03:27:45] Celestia what if we just fired a nuclear
[03:27:50] missile and we just America all over
[03:27:53] Celestia can't we just isn't that
[03:27:55] freedom listen Hey listen hey wouldn't
[03:27:58] we win Fino would be saved the prophecy
[03:28:01] won't be fulfilled hell yeah brother
[03:28:04] sorry it all became clear to me I still
[03:28:09] don't have the right to come to terms
[03:28:11] with Fate on behalf of everyone else as
[03:28:14] long as the final moment hasn't come
[03:28:17] it's still not too late don't worry I I
[03:28:22] will keep hope alive for everyone until
[03:28:24] the very
[03:28:28] end well that's enough for now I got the
[03:28:32] impulse to play the stricken Maiden but
[03:28:36] honestly considering my rank and station
[03:28:39] bro is she okay what yo what the f she
[03:28:42] literally switches just don't take any
[03:28:44] of what I just said no wonder cost no
[03:28:46] stamina when she Char attacks like five
[03:28:48] stamina the whims of trivial prophecy
[03:28:52] she's used to it come on Pon could have
[03:28:55] sworn you were actually being honest
[03:28:57] just
[03:28:59] now time we can't go back I more
[03:29:02] information out of her finina you might
[03:29:04] not have to shoulder this burden alone
[03:29:06] although I don't know what you might be
[03:29:07] keeping from everyone your people are
[03:29:09] more than willing to share the burden
[03:29:10] with you my burden that's impossible it
[03:29:14] was faded right from the start that this
[03:29:16] would be my duty
[03:29:20] alone but even if your burden doesn't
[03:29:22] need to be shared you can still choose
[03:29:23] to confide in
[03:29:25] someone just share it with me I'm what
[03:29:27] you call a
[03:29:29] witness yes I've heard that you came to
[03:29:33] to that from beyond the stars yes in
[03:29:36] other words you never belonged here okay
[03:29:39] that's kind of [ __ ] up to say but is
[03:29:41] in its entirety a show on a stage then
[03:29:45] you're just a spectator aren't
[03:29:49] you if that's the
[03:29:53] case please finina just spit it

[03:30:39] and gentlemen this this concludes my
[03:30:42] opening
[03:30:43] performance now without further Ado we
[03:30:46] may proceed to the trial of our
[03:30:49] God wait wait I have it I have it so
[03:30:52] this is what it is yes you deserve
[03:30:56] praise for the effort you took to raise
[03:30:58] the dramatic Stakes do not forget
[03:31:02] however that I am falor the god of
[03:31:05] Justice the embodiment of Justice itself
[03:31:09] does it not strike you as even the least
[03:31:12] bit absurd to bring the very concept of
[03:31:15] Justice to trial may I interpret these
[03:31:18] words as your refusal to stand trial in
[03:31:22] that case you will have the opportunity
[03:31:25] to defend your honor through no you
[03:31:27] don't want hey you do not look look
[03:31:30] na'vi already lost her dad child got
[03:31:32] [ __ ] clapped you I don't well not by

[03:31:37] blade against a
[03:31:39] god I mean that is an iron thing to be
[03:31:43] fair I see it seems like you have made
[03:31:46] up your
[03:31:56] mind Imon can't believe it she she just
[03:32:04] surrendered what the heck is going on

[03:32:09] a human wow how utterly
[03:32:13] humiliating lady finina what is the
[03:32:15] meaning of
[03:32:18] this it would seem that there has been a
[03:32:21] misunderstanding to be clear the raising
[03:32:24] of both hands is not always an
[03:32:26] indication of
[03:32:28] surrender looking for excuses again huh
[03:32:31] I raised my hands just now to indicate
[03:32:34] my acceptance of the trial no duel shall
[03:32:38] be necessary I will will admit that I've
[03:32:42] been running away for a long time I'm

[03:36:27] about chat the thing with my chat is you
[03:36:29] chat is really cool when we do normal
[03:36:31] stuff whenever we do archon quests or
[03:36:33] Star rail where I can't talk as much you
[03:36:34] guys have a mind of your own and that
[03:36:36] never ends well whenever chat are left

[03:36:44] wash your hands I did I did they're
[03:36:47] literally still
[03:36:49] wet all right let's keep
[03:36:58] [Music]
[03:37:05] going also please allow me to ask as a
[03:37:09] final question before the trial
[03:37:12] begins just how much work did you do to
[03:37:15] force me onto this stage well we did do
[03:37:19] a lot of prep after the meeting that
[03:37:22] day I can go over the tasks assigned to
[03:37:24] the Spina rosula since they were rather
[03:37:26] straightforward and easy Navia the
[03:37:29] president of the Spina rasula most of
[03:37:32] the people who participated in the
[03:37:34] disturbance this morning were my
[03:37:36] subordinates they changed into plain
[03:37:38] clothes and came to the opera house as
[03:37:40] regular audience members waiting for the
[03:37:42] oh so silver there too that's awesome
[03:37:44] Insurrection against you the people's
[03:37:47] resentment against their Aron has been
[03:37:49] building as more and more of the
[03:37:50] prophecy is fulfilled a spark was all we
[03:37:53] needed to turn smoldering anger into a
[03:37:56] flame moreover according to our
[03:37:59] understanding and Analysis of you when
[03:38:01] something like that occurred you would
[03:38:03] likely flee the scene and head to Pon by
[03:38:06] yourself so we arranged for a second
[03:38:09] group to lie and wait there so you mean
[03:38:14] the ones who scoured the settlement for
[03:38:16] me were also from the
[03:38:19] Spina and their goal was to force you to
[03:38:21] step into the giant magic box so you may
[03:38:24] personally participate in the greatest
[03:38:27] magic performance in all of
[03:38:30] Fontan that's right that house was a
[03:38:32] magic box rather than someone's
[03:38:35] residence as the super ultimate version
[03:38:37] of the setup that I used when I first
[03:38:39] performed at the the Opera epicel the
[03:38:42] volume of the box was increased by a
[03:38:44] whole order of magnitude and the
[03:38:46] distance it traversed was the entire gap
[03:38:49] between Pon and aranas its cargo of
[03:38:53] course was an archon instead of a human
[03:38:57] my thanks finina without your help we
[03:39:00] could never have pulled off such an
[03:39:02] extraordinary
[03:39:03] performance uh you're welcome of course
[03:39:08] this performance was only made possible
[03:39:09] with father's support the house of the
[03:39:12] heart spent a massive amount of Labor in
[03:39:14] Mora to pull this off we had to select a
[03:39:17] location construct the giant Magic Box
[03:39:20] dig a tunnel and open up a path through
[03:39:22] the water Chad does this guy Electro one
[03:39:23] kind of look like me be honest be honest
[03:39:26] kind of look like me in other words the
[03:39:28] earthquake that we felt within the giant
[03:39:31] magic box was just a normal tremor from
[03:39:34] the transportation of the whole house
[03:39:38] that's right it wasn't a sign of another
[03:39:40] disaster to come sorry then I can guess
[03:39:44] nervet and Clan's
[03:39:47] Parts you gathered a crowd prepared a
[03:39:50] stage and made sure that the champion
[03:39:53] duelist would be imediately ready for
[03:39:56] why are you wiping off your iron sting
[03:39:58] go make a better weapon look iron
[03:39:59] Sting's fine if you're aggravating maybe
[03:40:01] hyper blo did not really electr charge
[03:40:04] but realistically you're in this
[03:40:05] courtroom there's no dendro you're in
[03:40:06] font 10 so I wouldn't recommend going
[03:40:08] iron sting it depends on what you scale
[03:40:10] off of but I would highly recommend a
[03:40:11] crit weapon you go like Miss spitter
[03:40:13] would kind of match you you go Jade
[03:40:15] cutter primordial Jade cutter like the
[03:40:16] primordial C hey that's a reference to
[03:40:18] primordial you could do that you could
[03:40:20] also go maybe uh I don't know maybe the
[03:40:22] low light of foler incision uh you could
[03:40:24] do if you want a force weapon black
[03:40:26] sword wolf Fang um if you buy the battle
[03:40:29] pass I don't know if you buy the battle
[03:40:30] pass if not like black Cliff uh iron s
[03:40:32] is okay if you're using four stars but
[03:40:34] you'd really have to make sure you're
[03:40:35] proing reactions uh if not again maybe
[03:40:38] like lion roar from electric character
[03:40:40] especially R5 could be not bad uh other
[03:40:43] five stars you sorry let's keep going
[03:40:45] also that as soon as I appeared on the
[03:40:48] stage the trial May commence without a
[03:40:50] hitch am I right yes that is
[03:40:56] correct well florand I must commend you
[03:40:59] for your courage only the most
[03:41:02] outstanding Champion duelist in Alla
[03:41:05] Fontaine would accept a duel with an
[03:41:07] archon without flinching
[03:41:11] thank you okay as for you traveler I
[03:41:15] suppose your role was to keep me
[03:41:17] distracted with conversation once you
[03:41:20] found me in Pon you'd make sure that I
[03:41:23] didn't notice anything am missed before
[03:41:25] revealing we kind of dropped the ball
[03:41:27] though once we ared she was kind of
[03:41:29] being honest with us she would have told
[03:41:31] us everything I feel like and then we
[03:41:32] just did this we betrayed her no oh my
[03:41:36] mission was to give you one last chance
[03:41:41] we'd hope you sh oh well I guess yeah we
[03:41:44] hope you share your seet with us before
[03:41:45] the magic
[03:41:48] box I
[03:41:50] guess then I suppose I must have missed
[03:41:53] my n no we could we could have gotten
[03:41:55] out of her give us like give us like
[03:41:56] another day we would had it it's fine it
[03:41:59] matters not what's done is done the
[03:42:03] stage is already set so there's no
[03:42:06] reason to disappoint the
[03:42:08] audience let's see this trial through to
[03:42:11] the very
[03:42:13] end yeah the only thing we can do now is
[03:42:15] Judge the hydro
[03:42:17] archon so like how I feel a little
[03:42:19] bothered by the conversation earlier
[03:42:21] what did fre want to say right before we
[03:42:22] arrived Madam prosecutor please allow me
[03:42:24] to pass this along this is a charlot
[03:42:27] applied for
[03:42:29] and during the trial according to her it
[03:42:33] should speed up the proceedings huh
[03:42:36] Charlotte wanted to give us something oh
[03:42:38] so she's here too hey
[03:42:42] Charlotte okay oh Le
[03:42:45] see uh isn't just the exclusive
[03:42:48] interview that wait then that means this
[03:42:52] document is a perfect timeline of
[03:42:54] everything that's happened ever since we
[03:42:56] step foot in Fontaine so in other words
[03:42:58] we can refer to this anthology of
[03:43:00] evidence every time we want to use
[03:43:02] something from our journey as evidence
[03:43:04] for an argument super practical gift I
[03:43:07] just realized how long this Quest is
[03:43:08] going to be cuz I watched the trailer
[03:43:10] and we still haven't met [ __ ] skirk
[03:43:12] we haven't seen a whale which I fought
[03:43:14] for like 4 weeks now we haven't
[03:43:16] literally met like half the yo we
[03:43:18] haven't done [ __ ] it's a super practical
[03:43:20] gift let's quickly confirm the
[03:43:22] information in it just think of it as a
[03:43:24] refresher all
[03:43:26] right you defeated the hydro archon in
[03:43:29] the very first oh my God we're legit in
[03:43:31] courts that's one for the history books
[03:43:33] all
[03:43:35] right okay I'm not going to use Chad for
[03:43:38] this I just finished Chad I literally
[03:43:41] right before today like two days ago I
[03:43:43] just finished dongan RPA 2 I just
[03:43:46] finished well I'm technically still in
[03:43:48] like the ending like trial but like it
[03:43:50] basically
[03:43:57] done anyways I practice for this law
[03:44:01] student yeah but studying law doesn't
[03:44:03] they don't Chuck you in I
[03:44:05] mean I don't know become Len's attorney
[03:44:09] yeah we did
[03:44:10] I didn't think that you'd wind up
[03:44:11] getting to the bottom of the case I'd
[03:44:13] been following all this time this is the
[03:44:15] first time Miss
[03:44:17] nerby
[03:44:19] child
[03:44:21] AR I read that as the meeting with Kanye
[03:44:24] I'm what the [ __ ] the meeting with the
[03:44:25] naoui harbinger she's an extraordinary
[03:44:29] person her Instinct must mean
[03:44:33] something The Fortress of mpede was
[03:44:36] almost destroyed in a single day that I
[03:44:39] did didn't witness that scene personally
[03:44:41] will always be a source of professional
[03:44:43] regret I think according to miss net
[03:44:47] both child and that whale should have
[03:44:49] been in the primordial sea at that time
[03:44:51] I nearly lost my awesome friend Navia to
[03:44:54] be honest that's still gives me shivers
[03:44:57] the words of someone as extraordinary as
[03:44:59] a witch can probably only be truly
[03:45:01] understood when something surreal
[03:45:03] happens to
[03:45:08] you
[03:45:10] the prosecution and the defense how did
[03:45:12] she know all of this if you were
[03:45:13] listening sorry we told her it was an
[03:45:16] interview we told her Charlotte was like
[03:45:17] hey we interview and we
[03:45:21] Sorry come on nyet there's no need to
[03:45:25] repeat all the unimportant legal leades
[03:45:28] just fast forward to the part where the
[03:45:30] prosecution lays out my offenses as the
[03:45:33] defendant and the lead actress of this
[03:45:36] performance I still haven't even why she
[03:45:39] still my supposed guilt in all of this
[03:45:43] of course it is only natural for humans
[03:45:46] to struggle to understand the actions of
[03:45:49] a god however you will need more than
[03:45:53] that to convict me of a crime Bro [ __ ]
[03:45:56] it worst case I don't know the lore yet
[03:45:58] okay we'll see at the end of the quest
[03:45:59] worst case for just be like listen up
[03:46:01] okay I'mma Be Real I've been lying this
[03:46:03] whole time I can't do [ __ ] prophecy is
[03:46:05] going to kill us all we're all dead in
[03:46:07] like [ __ ] a week so for now just
[03:46:09] [ __ ] have fun I don't know spend your
[03:46:11] money do whatever you got to do boom
[03:46:13] that's it at least we'll have a last
[03:46:14] [ __ ] fun week in Fontan it is what it
[03:46:16] is [ __ ] it sorry I don't know let's keep
[03:46:19] playing that's true but my charge here
[03:46:20] is unrelated to your conduct as an
[03:46:22] archon the [ __ ] line talks dead I would
[03:46:25] like to charge you as a fraud who's
[03:46:27] never been the AR hunt in the first
[03:46:29] place wait what was that lady fen's a
[03:46:34] fraud hey I came here thinking that we
[03:46:37] were going to try the hydro AR AR for
[03:46:40] forsaking her deed yo did I hear that
[03:46:43] right she's not our archon at all charge
[03:46:50] accepted lady finina do you plead guilty
[03:46:53] to the
[03:46:57] charge lady finina I plead not guilty
[03:47:01] how can I be guilty there is no way that
[03:47:05] I otherwise known as finina de Fontaine
[03:47:10] s and the Regina of all Waters kindreds
[03:47:13] peoples and laws of Fontaine could be
[03:47:16] anything other than your true
[03:47:18] AR yeah even though lady finina can be
[03:47:22] rather eccentric isn't it going too far
[03:47:24] to doubt her very identity it's true
[03:47:26] yeah I've never questioned her identity
[03:47:29] either sure lady finina can be super
[03:47:32] irresponsible but but what grounds does
[03:47:35] that prosecutor have to make such a huge
[03:47:38] claim
[03:47:40] I have cause to believe that Common
[03:47:42] Sense will prevail in this case many of
[03:47:45] the members of the audience have known
[03:47:47] me as the hydro archon ever since they
[03:47:50] were born there would be no fooling
[03:47:53] their memory see even the orries has
[03:47:57] decided to show me its favor are you
[03:48:00] sure you want to commit to a charge that
[03:48:03] will never be
[03:48:05] upheld if you wish to drop the case I
[03:48:08] can promise you as the God of Justice
[03:48:11] that you will not have to face trial for
[03:48:13] making a false accusation we will treat
[03:48:17] everything that's happened as a dramatic
[03:48:19] spectacle and move on with our lives
[03:48:22] what do you say to
[03:48:24] that an argument with near impossible
[03:48:27] odds huh we have to not only refute
[03:48:30] fen's claims but also overturn the longh
[03:48:33] held beliefs of the
[03:48:35] people the people only see as their
[03:48:36] archon because that's their long held
[03:48:38] belief yeah I don't know if if you want
[03:48:39] to go against that I'm going to be real
[03:48:41] well I tried to give you the chance to
[03:48:44] surrender if you must persist then let
[03:48:47] me ask if you believe I'm not the archon
[03:48:52] then what manner of being do you think I
[03:48:55] am finina as a kid grew up playing get
[03:48:57] an impact she saw finina uh sorry she
[03:48:59] saw kokomi on TV she saw what Ki could
[03:49:02] do she was a Ki man she was like oh my
[03:49:03] God kookomi can walk on water she's
[03:49:05] literally a mermaid I want to be like
[03:49:07] her when I grow up and try to make it
[03:49:09] right that's why her hair looks like a
[03:49:10] jellyfish okay so that's what she was
[03:49:11] trying to do it's kind of like how
[03:49:13] Wanderer is like H I'm Wanderer I want a
[03:49:16] main shout like wander is a Shia M we
[03:49:18] know this right you look at Shia okay
[03:49:19] look look at wander right look at all
[03:49:21] his backstory he would M Shia if he
[03:49:23] played genjin if wander played genjin
[03:49:25] and wasn't in the game he would main
[03:49:27] chiao so he tried to like listen it just
[03:49:29] it's it is what it is wander would M
[03:49:31] chiao finina would main Ki let's just
[03:49:33] keep bu and if I was not the archon then
[03:49:37] how did I manage to live live for over
[03:49:40] 500
[03:49:42] years we got to think carefully what do
[03:49:44] we know to be special about finina
[03:49:47] exactly um she likes
[03:49:50] cake uh she likes I mean she's a good
[03:49:54] actress um she's cute don't forget that
[03:49:59] um she's
[03:50:03] fun
[03:50:08] um wait wait what is special about
[03:50:11] finina yo none of these are about finina
[03:50:14] uh okay lenn's attorney fontans can be
[03:50:17] dissolved by water sure child's
[03:50:20] conviction that's the [ __ ]
[03:50:23] mean what is this the meaning oh I mean
[03:50:25] I guess this is about finina the native
[03:50:27] she revealed that she had treat the that
[03:50:29] she had already probed for probed the
[03:50:31] [ __ ] does that mean finina on her own
[03:50:34] I'm going to look up probe right now
[03:50:37] probe from Starcraft a blunt ended
[03:50:40] surgical instrument used for exploring a
[03:50:42] wound or part of the
[03:50:44] body physically explore
[03:50:46] or oh yeah when she met her I remember
[03:50:49] okay I remember I remember when the cut
[03:50:50] scene she was like you don't have a a
[03:50:53] [ __ ] what is it called neosis no yeah
[03:50:55] neosis my bad on her own and believes
[03:50:58] that possibly not only is finina not
[03:51:00] really the AR okay it's this
[03:51:02] right wait no but it's why can she live
[03:51:04] so long Afflicted with some kind of
[03:51:07] curse yeah it might be the curse what
[03:51:08] about this
[03:51:10] uh I'm just going to click this it has
[03:51:11] to be this yeah can't be anything else
[03:51:14] first of all you may be a member of
[03:51:17] another long lived race which would
[03:51:20] allow you to naturally possess she's a
[03:51:23] meline no sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry even
[03:51:26] if that wasn't the case there could be
[03:51:29] other ways to extend your
[03:51:33] life okay sorry I was resetting
[03:51:35] something okay such as a
[03:51:38] curse who gave you that idea was it the
[03:51:42] name you speak so low as to use a
[03:51:45] harbinger's words against me doesn't
[03:51:48] matter who give us the information what
[03:51:49] matters is the veracity of the claim a
[03:51:51] curse a curse I once thought it possible
[03:51:54] that the or archon might naturally
[03:51:56] resemble a type of curse but in light of
[03:51:59] this claim perhaps what I sensed was not
[03:52:01] your Divinity but a curse after all you
[03:52:04] sensed it too oh like in Spider-Man AC
[03:52:07] into the spider across spiderverse
[03:52:09] there's like spot right who's like he
[03:52:11] was supposed to be the the the
[03:52:12] Spider-Man dude but like he didn't cuz
[03:52:14] the other dude got bit by like the
[03:52:15] spider like he yoed him so he became the
[03:52:17] spot yo so finina instead of an archon
[03:52:20] could you just be a cursed
[03:52:21] human lady finina is actually a human
[03:52:26] well it is true that it's extremely
[03:52:29] difficult to tell humans and gods apart
[03:52:31] just by looking at them it's not
[03:52:33] impossible that's wrong Lix I'm not here
[03:52:36] to debate Marvel I don't know okay I'm
[03:52:38] sorry I'm sorry well don't start
[03:52:41] celebrating too early now even if I have
[03:52:45] been carrying a curse like you said how
[03:52:48] does that prove that I am merely a human
[03:52:51] being besides everyone knows that the
[03:52:54] main difference between a human and a
[03:52:56] God is the possession of authority Gods
[03:52:59] can do what humans cannot that's why
[03:53:02] they're worshiped as gods for centuries
[03:53:05] manifestations of my authority have
[03:53:07] served the nation of
[03:53:09] Fontaine one need only to turn their
[03:53:12] eyes towards the orri mechanique de an
[03:53:15] cardal in oper house or consider the
[03:53:18] idium that is used in every aspect of
[03:53:22] life okay my bad that spoilers it's
[03:53:24] literally the first five minutes of the
[03:53:25] movie I watched chat literally the first
[03:53:26] five minutes anyways I'm no more
[03:53:28] immersion breaking okay we're going to
[03:53:30] keep
[03:53:31] going wait that one trial proved the
[03:53:34] opposite fre actually has no control
[03:53:35] over the at all yep that's the child one
[03:53:40] I told you I'm to reference the
[03:53:43] orrice I told you as confused as all the
[03:53:46] rest of us when the orrice declared
[03:53:48] child to be guilty without any proof
[03:53:50] otherwise you should have come up with a
[03:53:52] good explanation for that by now didn't
[03:53:55] I make myself clear at the time the
[03:53:58] decisions of the gods are naturally
[03:54:00] difficult for humans to comprehend there
[03:54:03] is no need to provide an
[03:54:06] explanation lady finina I believe a
[03:54:09] reminder of your current circumstances
[03:54:11] is in order while the court is in
[03:54:13] session the principles of justice and
[03:54:16] the law must come before all else while
[03:54:19] you are an archon you are also first and
[03:54:22] foremost the defendant in this trial you
[03:54:25] will prove yourself unable to defend
[03:54:27] against the prosecution's charges if you
[03:54:29] continue to withhold Vital Information
[03:54:31] against the rules of the
[03:54:33] court I never thought you'd use that
[03:54:37] kind of rhetoric against me
[03:54:39] that was no trick of rhetoric lady
[03:54:41] finina I've merely reiterated the rules
[03:54:43] of the court rules that all should
[03:54:46] respect and
[03:54:49] follow so you neither knew why child was
[03:54:53] declared guilty nor did you understand
[03:54:56] the structure and operations of the
[03:54:58] orries instead of having been created by
[03:55:01] you the manifestations of authority you
[03:55:04] mentioned have been made by the real
[03:55:06] hyro archon haven't they the real Hydro
[03:55:10] Aron well now you're really losing me it
[03:55:14] is true that I did not know why the
[03:55:16] orries gave out a guilty verdict that
[03:55:19] day but the orries handed out that
[03:55:22] verdict unilaterally and it has been
[03:55:25] operating independently ever since it
[03:55:27] was first created wait you telling me
[03:55:30] that in 500 years no one called her out
[03:55:32] I don't know we'll see but I feel you
[03:55:34] can't you can't argue that just because
[03:55:37] a Divine creation is FL L that the god
[03:55:40] behind it must also be no God at
[03:55:43] all she's still throwing out all kinds
[03:55:46] of excuses meanwhile in monat they just
[03:55:48] don't believe V be able to produce proof
[03:55:50] that she has no power just drinking
[03:55:53] wine sure we can put the orries aside
[03:55:56] for now but then miss Reena could you
[03:55:57] give us a brief demonstration of your
[03:55:59] powers in
[03:56:00] Aron my power as an
[03:56:03] archon there are many ordinary citizens
[03:56:06] in the audience How can I just
[03:56:09] carelessly demonstrate the formidable
[03:56:11] power of an
[03:56:12] archon if that poses a concern I'm
[03:56:15] prepared to extend my protection to the
[03:56:18] audience
[03:56:19] um you don't need to go that
[03:56:26] far a brief desion of your power over
[03:56:28] Hydro should be quite harmless surely
[03:56:30] and archon can at least match the
[03:56:31] capacity of human of the vision I was
[03:56:32] literally about to say that like
[03:56:34] literally we play as her right now she
[03:56:35] has a vision can she just press e sumon
[03:56:37] [ __ ] M MO
[03:56:39] and then just I don't know we'll see bro
[03:56:41] literally press your skill E I did it I
[03:56:43] just did it aren't you the hydro Aran or
[03:56:47] is it that you can't even wield the
[03:56:49] power of hydro much less the authority
[03:56:51] of a god IND demium yes it's all because
[03:56:56] of indem nium all archons derive their
[03:56:59] power from the faith of the people and
[03:57:02] I've converted the people's faith in
[03:57:04] Justice into
[03:57:06] emium thus did I give up all of my
[03:57:09] divine power to provide everyone with
[03:57:11] energy for their daily lives have you
[03:57:14] ever seen a more magnanimous God
[03:57:18] magnanimous isn't that a huge stretch
[03:57:23] yeah no matter how generous an Aron can
[03:57:25] be how could they give up all their
[03:57:26] power can a god with no power even still
[03:57:28] be called a god
[03:57:31] hey don't talk about finina like that it
[03:57:34] seems like nobody's buying fina's excuse
[03:57:37] hey come now everyone please don't stare
[03:57:41] at me as if I was a liar I'm still the
[03:57:44] same finina you knew right Marco me I
[03:57:48] don't hey I don't care who you are don't
[03:57:51] talk about finina like that good voice
[03:57:53] acting though sorry I'm still the same
[03:57:55] fre you right the one that you love
[03:57:57] shouldn't you want to believe in
[03:58:01] me please you've got to believe me if
[03:58:06] what the prosecutor said is true she
[03:58:09] really has committed a grave offense did
[03:58:11] she all of us and all of our parents and
[03:58:15] grandparents too and then all of our
[03:58:17] ancestors ever since they were born yo
[03:58:20] who asked you enough that's enough tell
[03:58:25] me then if I'm not the real Hydro me who
[03:58:31] is if you have
[03:58:33] no another Hydro archons existence nor
[03:58:37] can you find anyone who to be such then
[03:58:41] what ground have you to say that I'm not
[03:58:44] actually the real
[03:58:46] deal wow she came up with yet another
[03:58:49] argument how can we repute her now seems
[03:58:53] like she really doesn't want to give
[03:58:56] up
[03:58:59] October October 19th uh I said I called
[03:59:02] Ki the true Hydra archon there's
[03:59:03] probably evidence of earlier but that's
[03:59:05] just the in case you want
[03:59:07] some
[03:59:10] I can't Pro that she's an arch we can
[03:59:11] try to prove that she's just a human and
[03:59:12] if she's only
[03:59:14] human um then she wouldn't
[03:59:17] [Music]
[03:59:20] know
[03:59:24] um performance of grand opera house are
[03:59:26] cleared of the accusations leveled
[03:59:27] against
[03:59:31] them I mean I was thinking
[03:59:37] that
[03:59:41] what evidence can prove that f is human
[03:59:43] well the fact that nevet had to do this
[03:59:44] but I don't think that's it uh net fell
[03:59:47] into seawater but I don't think that is
[03:59:49] relevant but game's
[03:59:53] attorney clear revealed F can be
[03:59:57] dissolved water from the primordial sea
[03:59:59] over the years vashi kidnapped and
[04:00:00] dissolved many young girls for his
[04:00:01] experiments to try Okay
[04:00:06] uh might be this but I I don't know how
[04:00:08] that low
[04:00:11] key I mean if it's up to me I I use this
[04:00:13] what we learned about [ __ ] arino I
[04:00:15] don't know how the other ones relate to
[04:00:17] her this it can't be this
[04:00:19] one it could be this
[04:00:22] one it can't be
[04:00:25] that maybe
[04:00:30] why cuz she's not stopping people from
[04:00:33] getting dissolved maybe I guess [ __ ]
[04:00:37] it
[04:00:40] it has been that all fontans can
[04:00:43] dissolve from the primordial sea and
[04:00:46] that
[04:00:47] means since you insist on claiming to be
[04:00:50] a God and not a human then there's a
[04:00:53] method that you can use right here and
[04:00:55] now to eliminate all suspicions of you
[04:00:58] being the latter Miss Navia please apply
[04:01:01] to serve as a temporary attorney for the
[04:01:03] prosecution before addressing the court
[04:01:06] though you act in partnership with the
[04:01:07] prosec
[04:01:08] you must still adhere to proper
[04:01:11] procedure super Sorry Miss chief justice
[04:01:15] I swear this really will be the last
[04:01:17] time that I'll speak out of turn now
[04:01:20] I've brought some seawat from Pon as
[04:01:23] everyone knows a massive blood struck
[04:01:25] the area not long ago taking many lives
[04:01:29] including those of some of my closest
[04:01:31] friends s so miss finina would you dare
[04:01:35] to touch some of the sea water I'll
[04:01:37] drink it to believe that you are indeed
[04:01:39] the real Hydro archon touching the
[04:01:42] seawater would have no effect on you all
[04:01:44] it should do is strengthen your case but
[04:01:48] if you don't dare to touch it then we
[04:01:49] would have basically proved the
[04:01:53] reverse oh and I must remind you that
[04:01:55] after the disaster at pant nobody wants
[04:01:58] to see any more people dissolve I do
[04:02:01] hope why is it like open Arrow the
[04:02:03] simpler what if you you literally trip
[04:02:05] what if it falls and it just kills
[04:02:06] someone from the
[04:02:08] Rula thepa has governed Pon for many
[04:02:11] years I guess her suggestion is
[04:02:15] valid if lady finina is indeed just a
[04:02:17] human she's probably fanian like all the
[04:02:20] rest of us would she really dare to
[04:02:25] [Music]
[04:02:29] try my client finina while she is an
[04:02:32] archon and not just a mere human can't
[04:02:34] actually touch the water because archons
[04:02:36] their physical form could still dissolve
[04:02:38] and finina because she's so humble and
[04:02:40] wants to be loved by the people she
[04:02:42] chose to be one with the people instead
[04:02:44] of being condescending and and looking
[04:02:46] down upon you she said no I want to be
[04:02:49] have a human form that would dissolve
[04:02:51] like yours sorry uh finina lady finina
[04:02:55] this test has been unilaterally proposed
[04:02:57] by the prosecution as it falls outside
[04:03:00] the realm of standard Court proceedings
[04:03:02] you possess the right to decline
[04:03:07] participation
[04:03:11] what if she Chucks it at someone well of
[04:03:12] course he had to tell her that but
[04:03:14] refusing to participate is basically the
[04:03:16] same as a confession of guilt she's just
[04:03:19] staring at the water without saying a
[04:03:21] single word it really does seem like
[04:03:24] she's quite terrified of it that could
[04:03:27] only mean what's going on is she really
[04:03:31] planning
[04:03:33] to that's not what we thought she would
[04:03:36] I thought we'd be bluffing it should be
[04:03:37] fake water why is it real due to the
[04:03:40] inherent risk of the test lady finina
[04:03:42] you
[04:03:45] may what wait that was her right hand
[04:03:48] too bro use your left one the
[04:03:58] [ __ ] I I'm fine look look at me everyone
[04:04:04] my hand is still here I haven't been Des
[04:04:08] she's left-handed oh believe me now I
[04:04:11] really am your Aron I'm nothing like a
[04:04:14] normal human who would fall apart as
[04:04:17] soon as they touch this water true
[04:04:19] really was this not the most obvious
[04:04:21] thing in the world Miss Sween if you are
[04:04:25] present Miss sien please come forward
[04:04:27] and attend to the defendant
[04:04:32] sien wait why is she here don't be
[04:04:34] nervous it'll just take a few seconds H
[04:04:39] let me
[04:04:39] [Music]
[04:04:42] see that should be enough please
[04:04:45] announce the results of your evaluation
[04:04:47] to the court Miss seen as everyone
[04:04:50] doubtlessly saw Miss Farina was
[04:04:52] displaying symptoms of hyperventilation
[04:04:55] and flushed skin flushed these indicate
[04:04:58] that she was experiencing the adverse
[04:05:01] effects of exposure to primordial
[04:05:03] seawater the extent to which she was
[04:05:06] affected is the same as other humans
[04:05:08] when exposed to primordial seawater of a
[04:05:11] similar con you know I don't really like
[04:05:12] you right now first you shoot Linny then
[04:05:15] you like [ __ ] like man you literally
[04:05:17] like baited us and Lynette then that's
[04:05:20] two then you also are going against
[04:05:22] finina now you know what [ __ ] you sorry
[04:05:26] thank you Miss SI lady finina you may
[04:05:29] return to the defendant stand oh wait
[04:05:32] what did she just say I didn't get
[04:05:34] dissolved shouldn't that be enough to
[04:05:36] prove my innocence she's just a meline
[04:05:39] so is sadine at sadine
[04:05:41] goated well considering your tendency to
[04:05:44] run from your problems we did originally
[04:05:47] prepare a direct sample of the seawater
[04:05:49] around poon however after extensive
[04:05:52] discussion we exchanged it for a sample
[04:05:54] that is not concentrated enough to
[04:05:56] dissolve an actual Human After All on
[04:06:00] the off chance that something entirely
[04:06:02] unexpected might occur we don't want
[04:06:06] anyone else to lose their life to the
[04:06:08] Sea yeah so out of regard for fina's
[04:06:11] life you oh a low concentration sample
[04:06:15] and asked the head nurse to serve as an
[04:06:17] expert witness it's a great thing that
[04:06:20] the direct sample wasn't actually used
[04:06:22] finina could
[04:06:24] have I I can't believe
[04:06:29] you it's really going on here F could
[04:06:32] not known the conse can have not known
[04:06:34] the consequences of touching it as a
[04:06:35] human this is too unlike how she usually
[04:06:37] Acts unless it's actually more important
[04:06:38] for her to keep her upper facade than to
[04:06:39] save her own life yes it is I don't know
[04:06:42] why you just realized this now traveler
[04:06:44] she cares more about the ACT even if she
[04:06:46] lost her
[04:06:49] hand listen to me listen to me everyone
[04:06:53] please don't give me such cold and
[04:06:54] disdainful looks what happened just now
[04:06:57] didn't prove a single
[04:07:00] thing think about it how can you
[04:07:02] conclusively prove that an archon can't
[04:07:05] also be affected by the primordial
[04:07:08] water also also if I was really just a
[04:07:12] human why would I dare to just put my
[04:07:15] hand in that kind of
[04:07:23] water please everyone anyone just listen
[04:07:27] to me I swear I really am your
[04:07:34] Aron
[04:07:36] s
[04:07:45] I don't think anything she says at this
[04:07:47] point will sway anyone the odds are just
[04:07:50] too stacked against her now with all the
[04:07:52] things that have been said hon doesn't
[04:07:54] think there's any way left for finina to
[04:07:56] win I believe the time for arguments and
[04:07:58] presentation of evidence has come to an
[04:08:00] end if there are no objections we will
[04:08:03] move on to the final
[04:08:06] judgment
[04:08:13] I don't think anything she says at this
[04:08:15] will against her
[04:08:28] now in my capacity as chief justice I
[04:08:32] shall now render judgment on farina's
[04:08:34] misrepresentation of herself as the
[04:08:35] archon of Fontaine as a human who
[04:08:39] knowingly deceived her fellow citizens
[04:08:41] finina
[04:08:45] is
[04:09:00] guilty we shall now turn to the orrice
[04:09:03] mechan Jal C to render the final verdict
[04:09:05] on the charges
[04:09:13] the [ __ ] that was a
[04:09:17] starp
[04:09:21] gotcha according to the Judgment of the
[04:09:24] orrice mechan Jal Cardinal finina
[04:09:30] is well what's wrong what's the Ace's
[04:09:34] verdict no the orrice also display place
[04:09:37] a guilty verdict isn't that correct
[04:09:41] then however the exact wording of the
[04:09:44] verdict is
[04:09:45] thus the hydro Aron guilty to be
[04:09:50] punished via the death
[04:09:54] sentence
[04:09:56] yo what wait this is actually France
[04:10:00] sentences I've always thought that it
[04:10:02] was just a myth the one and only time
[04:10:05] the death sentence has been handed out
[04:10:06] at the court
[04:10:08] and it's been given to the very person
[04:10:09] we've worshiped as the God of Justice
[04:10:12] fine has been sentenced to death by the
[04:10:15] orries we just wanted to use the triail
[04:10:18] to show her the seriousness of things so
[04:10:20] she tell us the truth how did things
[04:10:23] escalate this
[04:10:24] quickly this outcome is indeed quite
[04:10:27] strange according to fontaine's current
[04:10:29] definitions of justice as well as its
[04:10:32] recommendations for criminal sentences
[04:10:34] is this sentence really appropriate for
[04:10:37] the crime CRI that have been committed s
[04:10:39] yeah even wasn't sentenced to death by
[04:10:42] The
[04:10:43] orri Mastermind behind the serial
[04:10:46] disappearances case smart strange is
[04:10:47] instead of freen now the rendered the
[04:10:49] judgment on the hydro archon yeah
[04:10:51] they're talking about the last Hydro
[04:10:52] archon wait now we have to prove that
[04:10:54] didn't we just prove she's not the hydro
[04:10:56] archon so doesn't that mean the other
[04:10:57] one has to die indeed the [ __ ] did the
[04:11:01] last one a sentence overly excessive the
[04:11:03] very point of our trial today was also
[04:11:05] to prove that finina has never being the
[04:11:07] hydro archon in the first place well I'm
[04:11:09] cooking but now the aura tree seems to
[04:11:12] have deliberately invoked the title of
[04:11:14] the hydro archon what does this mean
[04:11:17] wait your honor this judgment has to be
[04:11:19] false how because the whole premise was
[04:11:21] she's guilty of not being the hydro
[04:11:23] archon but then the the Judgment said
[04:11:24] the Hydra archon must die so it can't be
[04:11:26] my client it can't be finina finina
[04:11:28] doesn't
[04:11:29] die if finina is the Hydra archon then
[04:11:31] she wouldn't be
[04:11:34] guilty um excuse me if if I may
[04:11:38] interrupt REM this is your last
[04:11:41] chance sorry we love REM the trial still
[04:11:44] going yes it is fem you finally made it
[04:11:49] I assume this means you've completed
[04:11:50] your mission mhm any Mission father
[04:11:54] assigns to me will always be top
[04:11:56] priority okay
[04:11:58] based with some help from the other
[04:12:00] fatou from a brings a stone slate is oh
[04:12:02] that's the one we're missing what the
[04:12:04] first prophecy
[04:12:06] slate who who the [ __ ] is
[04:12:09] that huh so the Nave privately arranged
[04:12:12] for fade to try and find the missing
[04:12:14] slave i d you from it everywhere and
[04:12:17] finally found it at the bottom of the
[04:12:20] sea it took me a long time to get around
[04:12:23] some dangerous stretches of water he
[04:12:25] finally he cooked hey he cooked I
[04:12:27] doubted him at first I can't lie but he
[04:12:28] cooked already
[04:12:30] concluded then doesn't that mean I've
[04:12:33] come too
[04:12:35] late oh no
[04:12:37] father will be disappointed in me S
[04:12:40] don't worry the mystery hasn't been
[04:12:41] resolved yet it's not too late for you
[04:12:43] to
[04:12:44] shine thank you for your hard work Mr F
[04:12:48] please allow me to review the record
[04:12:49] left on the
[04:12:52] Slate traveler I believe that you have
[04:12:55] already seen the other existing slates
[04:12:57] would' like you to come here and confirm
[04:12:59] their
[04:13:02] contents looked like a satue of the
[04:13:04] seven but I don't know who the dude in
[04:13:05] the middle was what do you see what this
[04:13:08] looks like the previous hyaron releasing
[04:13:11] her divine power turning the oceanids
[04:13:12] into humans
[04:13:16] [Music]
[04:13:17] oh I believe I've now made sense of the
[04:13:20] hydro aran's crime it has to do with
[04:13:23] fontaine's lost
[04:13:25] history watch let me predict it are you
[04:13:27] ready Hydro AR just deceiving her people
[04:13:31] oh wait no that's finina and we've
[04:13:34] already proven that she's not the hydro
[04:13:36] archan
[04:13:37] uh so when you say Hydro archon do you
[04:13:40] mean the real Hydro archon we've been
[04:13:42] kind of talking about in truth
[04:13:45] everything that you've encountered in
[04:13:46] Fontaine up until this point can be
[04:13:48] traced back to the contents of these
[04:13:49] Stone slates however I'm uncertain as to
[04:13:53] how much sense they currently make to
[04:13:55] you association between the contents of
[04:13:57] the slates and events in real life let's
[04:13:58] try to recall the contents of the other
[04:14:03] three I remember what they
[04:14:05] were what what the [ __ ] is
[04:14:18] this the first stone slate describes
[04:14:21] what you just have we done this before I
[04:14:22] don't remember seems to show the
[04:14:24] previous Hydro archan using her divine
[04:14:26] power and then the oids turn into hum
[04:14:30] it's going to be like oh my God the
[04:14:31] previous Hydra archon their heart was so
[04:14:33] big their whole people got turned into
[04:14:35] oceanides so she committed or de I don't
[04:14:37] know they're they committed a cardinal
[04:14:39] sin of turning them back to humans and
[04:14:41] then they curse the next hydro archon
[04:14:42] which is finina watch and then it's like
[04:14:44] oh my God okay sorry the real uh does
[04:14:47] that mean that fontans are transformed
[04:14:50] oits oh P wasn't expecting that but if
[04:14:55] oids can turn into humans then perhaps
[04:14:59] this process can be reversed as well the
[04:15:01] second Stone slate shows Celestia
[04:15:03] floating in the sky and the Hydra Aran
[04:15:05] and her people wor it together but the
[04:15:09] heavens this must be the point when the
[04:15:11] hydro Aran and the fontans were branded
[04:15:14] with their original sin does this mean
[04:15:17] that the original sin and the hydro
[04:15:19] archon sin are the same thing the third
[04:15:22] slate shows the hydro Aron sinking into
[04:15:24] the sea surrounded by many
[04:15:27] people that reminds Pon didn't we also
[04:15:30] watch that happen to someone else
[04:15:33] Navia am I dumb didn't Navia sink
[04:15:37] well the force slate is the prophecy the
[04:15:39] fontans have been talking about people
[04:15:42] dissolving into the sea the hydro archon
[04:15:45] crying on her throne and so on we didn't
[04:15:48] believe that such a crazy disaster could
[04:15:50] happen at first did
[04:15:55] we but I have to verify the truths the
[04:15:58] real event related to prophecies the
[04:16:00] stone slates in the ruin describe a
[04:16:02] history of the
[04:16:04] future this is the first piece it seems
[04:16:06] to show the former Hydra archon using
[04:16:08] divine power to turn oceanids into
[04:16:10] people verify truth oh my foot's outside
[04:16:14] I got poutine it's going to get cold I
[04:16:16] don't need to eat it now but I don't
[04:16:17] want it to be cold in the Canadian
[04:16:18] winter let me get it and then we'll
[04:16:20] finish this after this short
[04:16:35] break

[04:20:26] my oh no did I just do my mouse pad wait
[04:20:29] one sec I'm going to pour water in my
[04:20:31] mouse
[04:20:33] pad let me cook
[04:20:35] chat
[04:20:46] balding I am I'm not balding I'm not
[04:20:53] balding wait there's water on the ground
[04:20:55] what the
[04:20:57] [ __ ] wait was something leak did I leak
[04:21:00] something how the [ __ ] did I leak
[04:21:05] something
[04:21:19] okay let me wash my
[04:21:35] hands
[04:21:39] okay
[04:21:42] back the moisture of the
[04:21:47] bag okay I'm
[04:21:50] here okay it seems to show the former
[04:21:53] Hydro Aron using divine power to turn
[04:21:54] oceanids into
[04:21:58] people we know from The Case of the
[04:22:01] serial disappearances of young women
[04:22:03] thought fontans can be dissolved in
[04:22:05] primordial seaw
[04:22:06] and the first stone slate tells us that
[04:22:09] long ago the hyro used her power to turn
[04:22:11] oids into humans this might be the
[04:22:14] reason that fontans can
[04:22:19] dissolve easy for
[04:22:21] Zs celesia floating in the sky and
[04:22:23] woring the hydro archon or people woring
[04:22:24] it together and hydro Aron people woring
[04:22:26] it together they still brought judgment
[04:22:27] down upon
[04:22:30] them might be
[04:22:35] this
[04:22:42] it might also be this I'm going to skip
[04:22:43] this one uh it shows the hydro gon
[04:22:46] singing into the sea by many
[04:22:51] people it's not as simple as falling
[04:22:53] into the sea when Navia fell into the
[04:22:56] sea her Consciousness was subjected to
[04:22:58] judgment the stone slates show the
[04:23:01] people gathered around the hydro archon
[04:23:03] in the
[04:23:03] sea could that be alluding to the same
[04:23:10] thing basically identical to that
[04:23:12] described in the prophecy containing
[04:23:13] circulating throughout Fontan font will
[04:23:15] eventually be dissolved into the sea and
[04:23:16] the hydr will sit alone on her throne
[04:23:18] and weep
[04:23:26] sag what does no I knew it it was this
[04:23:29] one cuz the the waters would kill
[04:23:30] everyone dude I just thought that girl
[04:23:32] was relevant she's not [ __ ] the [ __ ]
[04:23:33] tea lady not many people belied I'm
[04:23:35] eating my [ __ ] foress of nearly flooded
[04:23:38] with primordial seaer which we know can
[04:23:41] cause fontans to
[04:23:43] dissolve it seems increasingly likely
[04:23:45] that the prophecy may come true if we
[04:23:47] hadn't dealt with it in time things
[04:23:50] could have gone very
[04:23:58] badly perhaps what is about to take
[04:24:01] place hased before the true sin of the
[04:24:04] hydro archon that nervet mentioned and
[04:24:06] the original sin cast down on the people
[04:24:08] of Fontaine by Celestia as recorded on
[04:24:10] the stone
[04:24:14] slate they'll dissolve into the
[04:24:16] primordial sea but won't cease to exist
[04:24:20] their Essence will flow in the sea water
[04:24:23] converge and take the form of an
[04:24:28] oenid the hydro archon was sentenced to
[04:24:31] death in court shocking everyone
[04:24:35] present perhaps this means that her sin
[04:24:38] was actually fontaine's original
[04:24:42] sin eating meals for an 8-year-old bro
[04:24:45] it's 3:00 a.m. everything's closed
[04:24:47] except poutine and McDonald's I chose
[04:24:50] poutine that's literally everything else
[04:24:52] is closed
[04:24:54] here Navia fell into the water inside
[04:24:57] those ruins and she nearly dissolved she
[04:25:00] was surrounded by I'm not going to cook
[04:25:01] at 3: a.m. court within her
[04:25:03] Consciousness and was forced to in a
[04:25:06] trial meant to make her stay
[04:25:09] true the eruption of the primordial sea
[04:25:11] at The Fortress of mared was the shest
[04:25:14] sign that the prophecy was about to come
[04:25:15] to pass no matter
[04:25:19] what the prophecy's contents can all be
[04:25:22] verified by recent events if we combine
[04:25:25] what we know together loads of Truth
[04:25:27] should come to light
[04:25:35] true
[04:25:40] hello hello
[04:25:43] game oh it's a cut scene I'll shut up oh
[04:25:47] P gets never mind it's not a cut scene
[04:25:49] so that's how you can make sense of it
[04:25:51] but then it feels like we're going to
[04:25:55] have to share some truly shocking
[04:25:57] revelations let's hear them the first
[04:26:00] slate reveals that fontans are not real
[04:26:02] H what wait oh yeah cuz the ocean thing
[04:26:06] my bad I knew that incredible Lenny did
[04:26:09] you hear that
[04:26:11] we not real
[04:26:14] humans oh cuz they're French oh my god
[04:26:17] of course French PE yeah yeah allans
[04:26:20] were originally created by the late
[04:26:22] previous Hydro archon with oids as their
[04:26:26] basis the evidence for that can be found
[04:26:29] in how only fontans could dissolve in
[04:26:32] primordial seawater and how all the
[04:26:35] girls V dissolved were also turned into
[04:26:38] oids oh and according to Navia when she
[04:26:41] was about to get dissolved she also saw
[04:26:44] everyone gathered around for a trial all
[04:26:47] of them in the shape of
[04:26:49] oids
[04:26:53] indeed yeah and it follows from the
[04:26:56] content of the first slate that she
[04:26:59] probably anchored Celestia by creating
[04:27:01] humans without prior
[04:27:03] permission that could also explain the
[04:27:06] orries judged the hydro archon to be
[04:27:08] guilty it's to account for that ancient
[04:27:12] sin the hydro archon's true
[04:27:15] sin was creating us and yet after many
[04:27:19] hundreds of years the hydro aran's
[04:27:22] Creations have turned around to try to
[04:27:24] judge the archon within the Opera
[04:27:28] epicel the twists of History are often
[04:27:30] the most unexpected of all the third
[04:27:32] state I'm still convinced I should come
[04:27:33] after the fourth yeah is it the image
[04:27:36] here just like when Navia fell into the
[04:27:40] sea so wouldn't it be trying to show the
[04:27:43] image of the hydro archon also falling
[04:27:45] into the sea once the prophecy has been
[04:27:47] fulfilled in the fourth slate in the end
[04:27:50] the people will all be dissolved into
[04:27:52] the waters and only the hydro archan
[04:27:55] will remain weeping on her throne only
[04:27:58] then will the sins of the peopleon be
[04:28:01] washed away did Pon get all that
[04:28:04] right
[04:28:06] you've made some Keen deductions I must
[04:28:08] say given how much you still don't know
[04:28:11] it is impressive that you've already
[04:28:12] managed to connect so many pieces of the
[04:28:14] truth why is n that talking like he
[04:28:16] knows how the [ __ ] does this guy know
[04:28:17] able to decode all the information on
[04:28:19] the slates they've also been etched with
[04:28:21] an additional layer of hidden
[04:28:23] information using a different power
[04:28:25] source when we were at the ruins I tried
[04:28:28] to decipher the hidden information
[04:28:30] recorded in the slates but since we only
[04:28:32] had three slates at the time I was
[04:28:34] unable to come to to a full conclusion
[04:28:37] now that the Slate collection is
[04:28:39] complete I shall make another attempt to
[04:28:41] decipher The Narrative recorded within
[04:28:43] if everything goes well we should
[04:28:45] finally be in unadulterated
[04:28:58] truth
[04:29:00] well did you get it I believe I should
[04:29:03] share this truth not only with you but
[04:29:05] with all the people of Fontaine as well
[04:29:08] I will try to Briefly summarize it for
[04:29:15] you your hypotheses regarding the origin
[04:29:18] of fontans and the sin of the hydro
[04:29:19] archon were both
[04:29:21] correct in the Fontaine of old the
[04:29:24] previous Hydro archon sensed the
[04:29:26] yearning of her oenid familiars for life
[04:29:28] on
[04:29:30] land
[04:29:32] yo are we murdering oceanids and hydro
[04:29:35] shid for fun were enamored with the
[04:29:37] beauty and Romanticism of human beings
[04:29:39] and wishing to have those experiences
[04:29:41] for themselves expressed to the hydro
[04:29:43] archon their desire to become of a
[04:29:45] similar kind what if the end of genin
[04:29:47] impact is like vegan like it like vegan
[04:29:50] propagandas us where it's like we're
[04:29:51] killing all these enemies that are just
[04:29:53] normal people but getting turned or like
[04:29:55] life forms like like oceanids right and
[04:29:57] the hydro things and like the hilly
[04:29:59] trolls and we're just murdering them for
[04:30:00] fun for no reason so we should become
[04:30:03] pacifists that's the end of genin impact
[04:30:06] wow I just predicted that I predicted
[04:30:08] version 8.0 however even though water as
[04:30:12] an element is intricately linked with
[04:30:13] the power of Life the hydro archon as
[04:30:16] one of the seven did not possess the
[04:30:19] authority to create a new form of human
[04:30:21] life wait one of the seven wait like Jun
[04:30:23] cook not one to sorry I'll shut up she
[04:30:26] eventually found a way to create
[04:30:28] permanent humanoid bodies for her
[04:30:29] familiars by appropriating the power of
[04:30:32] this planet's primordial
[04:30:34] sea okay she poured primordial seawater
[04:30:38] into the oan its's blood vessels
[04:30:40] creating humanoid mimics in the
[04:30:43] [Music]
[04:30:46] process but if fontans were to ever come
[04:30:49] into direct contact with water from the
[04:30:51] primordial sea the power within their
[04:30:53] bodies would Escape these artificial
[04:30:55] restraints and return to the Sea as a
[04:30:58] result their forms would collapse and
[04:31:01] they would be reverted to their original
[04:31:03] forms as
[04:31:04] oits
[04:31:08] of course the hydro Aron never received
[04:31:11] permission from the Heavenly principles
[04:31:13] to create a new human
[04:31:16] race and thus the hydro archon and all
[04:31:20] of her Creations came to shoulder the
[04:31:21] original sin of appropriating the power
[04:31:24] of the primordial
[04:31:26] sea that is the true history of how the
[04:31:29] people of Fontaine first came into
[04:31:33] being so you I we were all oen before we
[04:31:37] turned into human
[04:31:42] beings bro why do I have to do I don't
[04:31:44] have oh I don't have an auto I was like
[04:31:45] what the hell that's way too much
[04:31:46] information for me I think I'm just
[04:31:48] going to pretend that I never heard a
[04:31:50] single
[04:31:53] thing wait but if that's the truth we
[04:31:55] can't let the hydro Aram be sentenced to
[04:31:57] death after all her only sin was
[04:31:59] creating us this really might be too
[04:32:02] much information for your regular fanian
[04:32:05] but it does answer a lot of our
[04:32:08] questions alas your hypothesis regarding
[04:32:10] the third and fourth Stone slates was
[04:32:12] inaccurate the Slate's respective
[04:32:14] positions are in fact correct wait I
[04:32:18] literally called it when I saw it the
[04:32:19] first time I said it was them birthing
[04:32:22] the new archon is that is that not what
[04:32:25] literally it is the key point of the
[04:32:26] visual on the third slate is how all the
[04:32:29] individuals depicted in the water are
[04:32:31] humans rather than oits no okay my bad
[04:32:34] they have not been dissolved
[04:32:36] which implies that the water depicted in
[04:32:38] this state is not water from the
[04:32:39] primordial sea I'm just of Fontaine is
[04:32:42] the nation of hydro as well as the
[04:32:44] nation of Trials and Justice instead of
[04:32:47] being the literal element the water in
[04:32:49] the scene symbolizes judgment and
[04:32:52] Justice you may also recall Nava's
[04:32:54] experience when she fell into the sea
[04:32:57] her Consciousness was surrounded by that
[04:32:59] of many others who intended to hold a
[04:33:01] trial to determine her
[04:33:03] fate therefore the meaning of the third
[04:33:06] slate is that the people of Fontaine
[04:33:10] shall try the hydro archon at the court
[04:33:12] of
[04:33:15] justice wait what the [ __ ] exclamation
[04:33:18] mark exclamation mark exclamation
[04:33:22] mark yes it refers to our present
[04:33:26] situation I think I'm following now so
[04:33:30] what you're saying is even though we
[04:33:32] decided to put on this trial to avoid
[04:33:34] fulfilling the prophecy in truth
[04:33:37] everything we've done has happened
[04:33:39] exactly as the prophecy
[04:33:41] foretold so now it seems we're the ones
[04:33:45] making sure it comes
[04:33:48] true what should we do wait so you're
[04:33:51] telling me if we just took one more day
[04:33:54] to just [ __ ] think about how the
[04:33:57] stone tablets work we wouldn't have done
[04:33:59] the [ __ ]
[04:34:02] prophecy if remin died for it one day
[04:34:04] earlier
[04:34:08] no I don't know it feels like there's no
[04:34:11] way out of this no matter what the
[04:34:14] prophecy will be
[04:34:18] fulfilled is this what it feels like to
[04:34:20] be a prisoner of Fate if that's the case
[04:34:23] does that mean the scene in the fourth
[04:34:25] slate will also be fulfilled would still
[04:34:27] happen later not necessarily what if you
[04:34:29] figure out what the third slate is so
[04:34:30] you're like [ __ ] it we're not going to
[04:34:31] have a trial and then you literally nuke
[04:34:33] the people of Fontan in game you ask
[04:34:35] strongly to drop a meteor They're All
[04:34:37] Dead the prophecy can't be fulfilled cuz
[04:34:38] how could they judge you if they're dead
[04:34:40] true TR sorry I would like to point out
[04:34:42] another small fallacy in your
[04:34:45] deductions about the fourth slate you
[04:34:48] probably thought that the eruption of
[04:34:49] primordial seawater Beneath The Fortress
[04:34:51] of meped served as the shest sign that
[04:34:53] the prophecy was about to come to pass
[04:34:55] yes sure I believe that rather than
[04:34:58] being a sure sign that eruption could in
[04:35:01] fact only be a small warning of
[04:35:03] something far worse to come
[04:35:06] as for the root cause of the catastrophe
[04:35:08] I believe you've already encountered it
[04:35:10] once
[04:35:15] before we're going to be teleported to
[04:35:17] the
[04:35:19] Vermilion it's like a Vermilion artifact
[04:35:21] just a small warning of the things to
[04:35:23] come we must find the root cause of the
[04:35:29] disaster what is the true source of the
[04:35:34] catastrophe
[04:35:37] I'm not going to look at chat the
[04:35:38] evidence that verifies the intrusion of
[04:35:40] the primordial sea it's not
[04:35:44] Lenny honestly could I don't know about
[04:35:46] Tri it actually could be
[04:35:51] Tri I mean the curse makes
[04:35:55] sense massive
[04:36:04] whale
[04:36:17] that
[04:36:18] doesn't that
[04:36:20] doesn't that doesn't bro I no I can't go
[04:36:23] on any of the oh it's a whale wait it
[04:36:26] was the whale and
[04:36:29] reality it's you I'm not a whale sorry
[04:36:32] if we're talking about a true culprit
[04:36:34] that could only be that thing inside the
[04:36:36] primordial sea
[04:36:40] right I'm not going to lie I got like
[04:36:42] everyone correct on the first try except
[04:36:44] this one so I'm just going to explain
[04:36:46] something really fast I lowkey forgot
[04:36:48] because we did I this is why I don't
[04:36:49] like trailers I saw the whale in the
[04:36:51] trailer and I've been fighting the whale
[04:36:53] as a weekly boss for like four weeks now
[04:36:55] so I didn't know if me seeing the whale
[04:36:57] was just me seeing the whale or if I saw
[04:36:58] it actually in the archon quest and I
[04:37:00] kind of forgot about the whale any let's
[04:37:01] keep going the truth the original sin
[04:37:05] the and the root cause of the
[04:37:22] disaster oh oh
[04:37:29] no well at least we get to see SK
[04:37:34] whoa
[04:37:44] Teno surely a dragon clears a whale
[04:37:47] right never mind they're dead we're
[04:37:49] [Music]
[04:37:51] Bozo
[04:37:54] oh the [ __ ] did this guy come from
[04:37:57] aren't you in
[04:38:01] [Music]
[04:38:03] jail
[04:38:16] DN yo that will does not look damaged
[04:38:18] never mind he dipped okay maybe he is he
[04:38:21] looked exactly the
[04:38:23] same hey
[04:38:26] child dude imagine if this form was
[04:38:28] playable holy
[04:38:33] [ __ ]
[04:38:42] what the
[04:38:43] [ __ ] yo what that was way too close he
[04:38:47] just wandered did that thing just burst
[04:38:49] into the Opera
[04:38:50] House wait was that the huge wheel you
[04:38:54] saw in your
[04:38:55] dream so we've met it at last I
[04:38:59] understand very well why it has chosen
[04:39:00] to make an appearance here BR said
[04:39:03] thumbs down and then dipped do not
[04:39:04] belonged to that it is a monster that
[04:39:07] has traversed the Stars weeping all the
[04:39:11] while it has been greedily consuming the
[04:39:14] energy from the planet's primordial sea
[04:39:17] using it to grow that is the main cause
[04:39:20] for the rising sea levels the day about
[04:39:22] to reset once it has finished consuming
[04:39:24] all of the energy contained within the
[04:39:25] sea its next step will be you said that
[04:39:30] when the hydro archon first created
[04:39:32] fontans out of
[04:39:33] oids she filled their blood vessels with
[04:39:36] primordial seawater precisely that whale
[04:39:39] finds the blood of Hans n impossible to
[04:39:43] resist therefore when it left the
[04:39:46] primordial sea it decided to make its
[04:39:48] next stop a packed opera house full of
[04:39:50] food food in the form of
[04:39:53] fontans we just barely managed to push
[04:39:56] it back right in that case won't it come
[04:39:59] back to target the people again once
[04:40:01] it's managed to recover its strength
[04:40:04] that is correct
[04:40:05] indeed it is more accurate to say that
[04:40:07] we should thank that Harbinger for
[04:40:08] buying us some time without him the
[04:40:11] whale would have likely come on to land
[04:40:13] far sooner from the way he looked he
[04:40:16] must have been fighting the creature for
[04:40:18] quite a long
[04:40:20] time how is child okay battle Maniac
[04:40:24] we've always known that he had a special
[04:40:26] connection with that whale but we
[04:40:27] definitely didn't expected to help us
[04:40:29] out like this anyway now that we know
[04:40:33] that this whale is the actual cause of
[04:40:35] the disaster recorded in the prophecy
[04:40:37] all we need to do to stop the prophecy
[04:40:39] would be to find a way to beat it up
[04:40:41] right it is too late what do you mean it
[04:40:44] had already absorbed too much of the
[04:40:46] primordial SE energy before we could
[04:40:48] notice it at this point it has become
[04:40:51] practically integrated with the sea
[04:40:53] itself even if the entirety of tat were
[04:40:56] to be destroyed it could still survive
[04:40:59] and swim off towards some other world
[04:41:02] that that's not something I will accept
[04:41:05] wait surely if that exists we'll get up
[04:41:07] the quantum void element soon right
[04:41:09] found the true culprit we going a void
[04:41:10] character come so far you can't just
[04:41:14] tell me that the last hurdle is some
[04:41:16] impossible foe that's just indeed that's
[04:41:20] how a grand performance should end I'll
[04:41:23] fight it to the end no matter what okay
[04:41:26] I mean I respect that prophecy will be
[04:41:28] fulfilled no matter what
[04:41:33] huh
[04:41:36] dot do dot the prophecy yes what has
[04:41:39] been prophesized will be fulfilled you
[04:41:42] may view such things as the history of
[04:41:45] the
[04:41:51] future after everything it's still
[04:41:53] turned out like this we couldn't fight
[04:41:54] against
[04:41:56] fate but wait if this is all about fate
[04:41:58] just as prophecies are usually only the
[04:42:01] future as seen from the perspectives of
[04:42:04] the Gods
[04:42:05] could things be happening in Hidden
[04:42:07] Corners where the God's gaze does not
[04:42:15] fall ultimately fate Shall Serve as your
[04:42:19] only guide no matter what will happen in
[04:42:21] Tat's
[04:42:24] future all you need to do is to Play
[04:42:27] Your
[04:42:33] Part
[04:42:35] could be that you the prophecy will be
[04:42:36] fulfilled there will still a way to save
[04:42:37] everyone did I miss
[04:42:43] something wait I forgot about finina
[04:42:45] what is it that you want to say to me at
[04:42:46] the last moment in the Box what is her
[04:42:49] real
[04:42:57] secret yo what the [ __ ] is happening
[04:43:00] what's happening with the
[04:43:03] orri i leave it is preparing to carry
[04:43:06] out the death
[04:43:11] sentence she's going to start weeping on
[04:43:13] her
[04:43:18] throne no I still need
[04:43:33] answers
[04:43:43] [Music]
[04:43:46] the [ __ ] is
[04:43:49] that bro what
[04:43:52] the what the [ __ ] was
[04:43:55] that do I have to play
[04:44:03] no why is she
[04:44:08] Barefoot
[04:44:12] you oh
[04:44:14] finina sorry that shocked expression on
[04:44:18] your face is just too amusing but I like
[04:44:20] her voice I couldn't help myself yo can
[04:44:23] she be
[04:44:24] playable you are not
[04:44:26] finina who are you coore ah The Sweet
[04:44:31] Sound of
[04:44:32] bewilderment marvelous a sure sign that
[04:44:35] my attempt to deceive everyone was a
[04:44:37] resounding
[04:44:39] success but to answer your question I am
[04:44:43] falor you know the God
[04:44:48] falor why did you deceive
[04:44:51] us oh that wasn't my goal of course
[04:44:54] goodness no but I had to fool everyone
[04:44:58] else too if I was to stand any chance of
[04:45:02] deceiving the Heavenly princess
[04:45:05] deceiving the Heavenly
[04:45:08] principles it's all because of that
[04:45:10] pernicious prophecy Dreadful wasn't it
[04:45:14] everyone doomed to dissolve Fontaine
[04:45:17] condemned to be flooded one was not
[04:45:20] amused in fact one was positively beused
[04:45:24] when that problem was thrust upon me by
[04:45:27] my dearest
[04:45:28] predecessor that's the former Hydro Aron
[04:45:31] egeria for the uninitiated it hardly
[04:45:35] gets more disastrous than a pre-ordained
[04:45:37] national
[04:45:39] catastrophe now does it she knew full
[04:45:42] well that the prophecy would surely come
[04:45:44] to pass and as one of the seven She also
[04:45:49] knew full well that one defies the
[04:45:52] Heavenly principles at one's Peril so
[04:45:55] yes as you have no doubt surmised it was
[04:45:59] a rather impossible situation that I
[04:46:02] found myself in I spent a terribly long
[04:46:06] time mulling it over alone on the ocean
[04:46:09] floor and I was almost growing Barnacles
[04:46:13] by the time I finally
[04:46:15] realized there was only one possible
[04:46:18] solution to this confounding conundrum
[04:46:21] English I had to outwit the Heavenly
[04:46:24] principles allow the prophecy to be
[04:46:27] fulfilled ostensibly at least while
[04:46:30] saving everyone at the same time oh I'm
[04:46:34] a genius I know I can only assume that's
[04:46:38] why egeria chose me as her successor
[04:46:41] although Looking Back Now it was hardly
[04:46:45] The Inheritance one dreams of between
[04:46:48] the task of saving the nation the
[04:46:50] quotidian duties of the Hydra archon and
[04:46:54] not to mention the original sin of
[04:46:56] creating a new race of humans I dare say
[04:47:00] she left me quite a colossal mess to
[04:47:03] clean up
[04:47:05] that one can only play the hand one is
[04:47:09] dealt I did not choose this anymore than
[04:47:12] I chose to be one of her oate
[04:47:16] familiars so you were also once one of
[04:47:18] the oits transformed into a human by
[04:47:21] eger's hand yes I was I always dreamed
[04:47:27] of becoming human and I still do even
[04:47:32] now in my eyes
[04:47:34] to be human is to be part of the
[04:47:36] greatest Opera ever known after becoming
[04:47:40] a God I separated my Divinity from my
[04:47:44] body in spirit leaving behind only a
[04:47:47] self that was as naive and bewildered as
[04:47:50] my past self on her first day as a human
[04:47:54] what the [ __ ] the me you see before you
[04:47:56] now is that Divinity and the human
[04:48:00] counterpart I left behind I named finina
[04:48:05] she could feel Joy sorrow and everything
[04:48:09] in between she could be as Vain and
[04:48:12] conceeded or as Meek and vulnerable as
[04:48:15] she wished her strengths were of a Kind
[04:48:19] only a human could possess as were her
[04:48:24] shortcomings but in my eyes fen's
[04:48:28] Humanity was what made her
[04:48:30] perfect she was perfectly human in every
[04:48:34] way the person I always wanted to be
[04:48:39] anyway she's been sad until then I
[04:48:41] cursed
[04:48:42] her yo what the [ __ ] there all part of
[04:48:46] the plan of course the plan to deceive
[04:48:49] the Heavenly
[04:48:52] principles do you still remember the
[04:48:55] anyway so then I cursed her the Hydra
[04:48:58] archon alone weeping on her throne in
[04:49:03] order that the prophecy might appear
[04:49:05] fulfilled I invited finina to be an
[04:49:09] actress to play the part of the hyro
[04:49:12] Aron in the prophecy under the curse I
[04:49:16] placed on her so long as I fur's
[04:49:20] Divinity continued to exist she could
[04:49:23] not die but nor was she free to live her
[04:49:27] life in the pursuit of
[04:49:28] happiness instead she was forced to take
[04:49:32] the stage in the Opera House house to
[04:49:35] embrace the role of Leading Lady to
[04:49:38] Forever play the part of the god from
[04:49:41] the prophecy all to create a deceitful
[04:49:44] appearance of that prophecy coming to
[04:49:47] pass I suppose now you probably
[04:49:50] understand why your court is called the
[04:49:52] Opera
[04:49:53] epicel but finina is only human isn't
[04:49:58] she even though she has had a long life
[04:50:01] her mind is no stronger than that of any
[04:50:03] other ordinary human being I cannot
[04:50:07] begin to Fathom what she has had to
[04:50:10] endure it must have been torture for her
[04:50:13] it has indeed and although she is in a
[04:50:17] sense me in human form I most definitely
[04:50:21] owe her an apology for
[04:50:24] it it's been 500 years and all along
[04:50:30] she's been playing her part in the most
[04:50:33] unim imaginably long unbearably lonely
[04:50:38] and agonizingly painful Opera of all
[04:50:41] time
[04:50:47] B man [ __ ] you
[04:50:52] falor you made finina
[04:51:02] Cry
[04:51:11] 500 years of suffering like I get why
[04:51:14] she did it but [ __ ] you it's like when
[04:51:16] it's like when okay not for an obscure
[04:51:18] reference but it's like when Leorio
[04:51:20] punches gon's Dad it's like dude [ __ ]
[04:51:23] you what is she doing on stage wait a
[04:51:25] moment that probably isn't finina it's
[04:51:27] likely a reflection of her inner
[04:51:31] self speak directly to her I think know
[04:51:33] I wanted to
[04:51:35] know came here for answers so
[04:51:37] opportunity is not to be missed let me
[04:51:38] try talking to
[04:51:45] her not the same thing dude imagine not
[04:51:48] only having to be French for 500 years

[04:52:54] heart she still playing the role of
[04:52:55] Hydra archon what sort of resolve would
[04:52:58] she have even her inner self and
[04:53:00] subconscious would have such an
[04:53:01] impenetrable defense I have to find a
[04:53:02] way

[04:55:53] prophecy have you heard of it what
[04:55:59] prophecy wait I
[04:56:02] know I think I don't know why but it's
[04:56:07] in my head somehow the people will all
[04:56:11] be dissolved into the waters and only
[04:56:14] the hydro archon will remain weeping on
[04:56:18] her
[04:56:19] throne only then will the sins of the
[04:56:22] people of Fontaine be washed away
[04:56:26] oh very good you know it well what's
[04:56:32] going on
[04:56:34] I can't seem to remember anything
[04:56:37] clearly the only thing I know for sure
[04:56:41] is this
[04:56:42] prophecy will it really come to
[04:56:46] pass yes it will and that is why I've
[04:56:51] come to you disaster will come to
[04:56:55] Fontaine sooner or later things will
[04:56:58] develop just as the prophecy
[04:57:01] declared there is no escaping it but
[04:57:06] doesn't that mean everyone will die I'm
[04:57:09] a fanian just like them will I dissolve
[04:57:15] too oh don't worry magical meetings
[04:57:19] exist in this world precisely to give
[04:57:22] people a chance to turn things
[04:57:24] around it is the reason why you met me
[04:57:28] today I will tell you how to save
[04:57:31] everyone but
[04:57:33] you may have to suffer somewhat
[04:57:37] again
[04:57:39] oh so there's still hope after all
[04:57:43] goodness you frightened me you spoke so
[04:57:46] much and with so much
[04:57:48] certainty as for the suffering well I
[04:57:53] will admit that the first thing that
[04:57:55] came to mind was oh this is the past
[04:57:58] have to be the one to suffer I forgot of
[04:58:00] the camera if the prophecy will come
[04:58:02] true the suffering is die anyway right
[04:58:07] so if I've already met you as my magical
[04:58:10] meeting in this world if there were
[04:58:13] scales with all the people of Fontaine
[04:58:16] on one side and my pain on the
[04:58:20] other is it not obvious where the scales
[04:58:23] should
[04:58:26] tilt you truly are the perfect human my
[04:58:32] ideal I suppose this would also be the
[04:58:35] justice that belongs to you huh don't
[04:58:39] worry it's nothing listen well Fontaine
[04:58:44] has just lost its Hydro archon I need
[04:58:47] you to play a role that of the new
[04:58:52] archon play as a God that's right you
[04:58:59] must begin a NeverEnding masquerade you
[04:59:03] you must never let anyone suspect your
[04:59:06] identity if you can keep it up then I
[04:59:10] shall have my way of defying this
[04:59:13] prophecy but should your identity be
[04:59:18] revealed then all hope will be lost Dum
[04:59:23] but how will I do this a human assuming
[04:59:27] the role of a god without being
[04:59:30] exposed don't worry what you you must do
[04:59:33] is not to turn yourself into a real God
[04:59:37] you simply need to play the role of a
[04:59:40] God as humans imagine them to be being a
[04:59:44] human yourself I'm sure you already know
[04:59:47] what such an entity would be like
[04:59:51] remember your true challenge will not be
[04:59:54] pursuing
[04:59:56] Divinity but contending Against
[05:00:00] Humanity um I'm still not not sure I
[05:00:04] understand
[05:00:05] but I'll
[05:00:07] try I'll try to do this so how long am I
[05:00:12] going to have to play this role to
[05:00:15] accomplish this Mission you will have to
[05:00:18] stay on the stage for many many years
[05:00:23] you will endure and not grow old until
[05:00:26] your task ends but I promise you all
[05:00:32] will eventually end in a magnificent and
[05:00:36] dramatic trial and everyone will be
[05:00:39] saved copium what about silver what
[05:00:42] about Malo how
[05:00:44] exciting I'll be looking forward to
[05:00:54] it CH how many years did Shia have to
[05:00:57] Stu sorry not going to make this a about
[05:01:01] out
[05:01:20] s TR if you have to okay let's say you
[05:01:23] have to like fake being the archon right
[05:01:25] can't she just have a police state and
[05:01:27] then just have like just have like a
[05:01:29] whole military enforcing that she's the
[05:01:31] archon
[05:01:34] I'm sorry where the [ __ ] am I going oh
[05:01:35] it's
[05:01:39] thrown Ryden no don't
[05:01:52] dude the maon Cardinal has announced my
[05:01:55] accession but this is my first time
[05:01:59] facing the
[05:02:01] people
[05:02:03] what should I say to most appear like a
[05:02:06] god to be honest I still don't
[05:02:10] know perhaps I should first try to act
[05:02:14] natural
[05:02:15] courage ladies and gentlemen good
[05:02:19] evening and welcome to the Opera epic
[05:02:23] Clays I'm sure you've all heard about
[05:02:26] how I have taken on the role of hydro
[05:02:28] archon indeed I am finina defontaine
[05:02:32] your new
[05:02:35] archon pure Earnest in truth I know
[05:02:39] little about becoming a nation's new God
[05:02:42] but it will be my honor to guide you all
[05:02:45] as the god falor the God of Justice I
[05:02:49] shall do all within my power to lead you
[05:02:52] into an age of fairness and Justice
[05:02:56] close politely once again thank you all
[05:02:59] for coming you're welcome if you should
[05:03:01] have any questions or suggestions please
[05:03:04] send them to the Maison cardinalis the
[05:03:07] future of Fontaine will require us to
[05:03:10] work together after all this should do
[05:03:14] it I thought I might stammer but
[05:03:17] thankfully I was able to conve my
[05:03:20] thoughts just fine okay and next that's
[05:03:24] the new Hydro archon is this some kind
[05:03:27] of joke [ __ ] you I would have thought
[05:03:29] that a being that surpasses Humanity
[05:03:31] would be a bit more
[05:03:34] assertive hey did you hear that she even
[05:03:37] told us to send her suggestions there at
[05:03:39] the end shouldn't Gods be all powerful
[05:03:43] she's being so modest what's the
[05:03:46] difference between her and an ordinary
[05:03:47] person
[05:03:49] then if you ask me perhaps the
[05:03:52] succession didn't actually happen she
[05:03:54] might just be a maon back puppet wait
[05:03:57] what's going
[05:03:58] on why is everyone suspecting me of
[05:04:01] being a fake
[05:04:04] this is bad if I get exposed here
[05:04:07] there'll be no saving the people from
[05:04:09] the prophecy right M me said that I just
[05:04:13] need to play the role of a God as humans
[05:04:16] imagine them to be calm down finina
[05:04:20] think think what do the people want how
[05:04:25] would they imagine a God to speak and
[05:04:27] act assertive with a strong sense of
[05:04:30] presence one who can dispel all
[05:04:33] doubt that is the character I'm faded to
[05:04:37] play D that's why they made
[05:04:42] her yeah y the VA actually popped off
[05:04:47] very good M she was forced to be I
[05:04:49] almost said Annoying but I don't know if
[05:04:50] the word is
[05:04:53] arant now I was wondering if some weak
[05:04:58] puppet were to one day come on to the
[05:05:01] stage and claim owner ship of this opera
[05:05:03] house would the children of Fontaine
[05:05:06] follow
[05:05:08] them well it seems that you would all
[05:05:11] see right through them having passed my
[05:05:14] test you are qualified to witness
[05:05:17] wondrous trials alongside my AUST self
[05:05:21] here in this house I have a question uh
[05:05:25] okay we know why finina ACC way now does
[05:05:27] anyone know why Fel acts this way like
[05:05:29] okay finina we get it now we know the
[05:05:31] lore behind it makes sense why is Fishel
[05:05:33] acting like this though like why okay
[05:05:37] you may consider my previous act a door
[05:05:40] gift of sorts I thought it was a debut
[05:05:43] that suited the
[05:05:47] atmosphere oh was it explained in the
[05:05:49] event oh yeah the [ __ ] official event
[05:05:52] okay I forgot about that yeah I remember
[05:05:54] that event okay I mean all
[05:05:57] whatever fine I rest my case I mean I I
[05:06:02] cons
[05:06:03] seed now then let us be
[05:06:07] [Music]
[05:06:09] reintroduced so that was just a
[05:06:11] performance how could I have forgotten
[05:06:13] that we were inside an opera
[05:06:16] house a personality it's quite shocking
[05:06:20] to be honest but I suppose it's a better
[05:06:22] look than before such a fascinating and
[05:06:25] full deity how wonderful our future may
[05:06:29] yet be bright after
[05:06:31] all
[05:06:33] it seems I've turned them around best
[05:06:36] follow this flow and restart my
[05:06:38] accession speech resolutely with
[05:06:41] conviction my dear people whether you
[05:06:44] acknowledge me or not whether you trust
[05:06:47] me or nay I say to you keep faith in
[05:06:51] your ARD for
[05:06:54] justice we have heard it said that this
[05:06:57] nation's sins can no longer be washed
[05:07:00] away well I say that Justice is most
[05:07:04] fragrant when it blooms amid sin [ __ ]
[05:07:06] turn up the drama scales of Justice
[05:07:09] should not weigh heavy in the hands of
[05:07:11] its God on one side it must carry
[05:07:15] fairness and
[05:07:17] Justice and on the other pise and
[05:07:21] Applause May law be the prayer on our
[05:07:25] lips May judgment be our worship let us
[05:07:30] light the fires and drink to the future
[05:07:33] of Fontaine there actually different
[05:07:35] options based on what I click there is
[05:07:37] no trouble in this world that Justice
[05:07:41] cannot solve all that is needed is for
[05:07:44] you my people to believe in it heart and
[05:07:49] soul so long as I the archon falor stand
[05:07:54] within the Opera epic so long as I stand
[05:07:58] before the
[05:07:59] orrice I shall even judge the gods of
[05:08:03] this

[05:09:18] trials were the one that I'm looking
[05:09:20] forward to the
[05:09:22] most um if I may be so impertinent what
[05:09:26] kind of trial are you truly looking
[05:09:27] forward to a magnificent dramatic and
[05:09:32] wondrous trial a trial to end all
[05:09:38] things how could you hope to understand
[05:09:42] that's true I fear I lack the ability to
[05:09:45] grasp Your Divine thought lady archon no
[05:09:48] need for fright and do not take what I
[05:09:51] said before too
[05:09:53] seriously go now do your duties the
[05:09:56] trial I await it will come one day d
[05:10:12] [Music]
[05:10:25] lady finina I I don't know what to say
[05:10:28] thank you for agreeing to see me no need
[05:10:31] to thank me or rather thank your own
[05:10:34] sense of perseverance instead long have
[05:10:37] you stood in line to meet me have you
[05:10:41] not oh I'm afraid that's just an
[05:10:45] inevitable consequence of my Divine
[05:10:48] charm all right dearia is it how is your
[05:10:52] son's
[05:10:54] illness you remembered me and you knew
[05:10:57] of my family too of course I'm a go
[05:11:00] doing much better now in fact he is far
[05:11:03] more of an art and believer than I he
[05:11:05] was the one who forced me to seek an
[05:11:07] audience with you and to bring your
[05:11:09] words back to
[05:11:12] him good very good if this should happen
[05:11:17] again in the future please do not
[05:11:19] hesitate to come and tell me going down
[05:11:22] to Citizens homes every so often well
[05:11:24] not usual practice should serve as a
[05:11:27] fine change of
[05:11:29] pace you're such a gentle and wise guy
[05:11:32] God thank you once again on behalf of my
[05:11:39] [Music]
[05:11:48] [Music]
[05:12:00] son
[05:12:02] lady finina here are the latest
[05:12:04] hydrological reports as for the specific
[05:12:07] parameters you asked to take note of I'm
[05:12:10] afraid things still don't look good I
[05:12:13] see it's as I thought then as your God I
[05:12:18] did already expect this but I wanted to
[05:12:21] see how far your human wisdom would
[05:12:23] allow you to analyze it all manner of
[05:12:27] signs indicate that the prophecy will
[05:12:29] still come to pass forget it that's not
[05:12:33] something you need to worry about right
[05:12:36] now well as I understand it the Fontaine
[05:12:40] Research Institute is also trying to
[05:12:41] find a way to counter the rising water
[05:12:43] levels really have they found anything
[05:12:47] I'm afraid that they haven't found any
[05:12:50] effective solution thus far
[05:12:53] okay is that so well no wonder this
[05:12:57] issue has reached the realm of the Gods
[05:13:00] after all still their spirit is
[05:13:07] praiseworthy this is the last one am I
[05:13:09] sleeping
[05:13:13] V the day is finally
[05:13:16] over I haven't had a moment to breathe
[05:13:20] this whole time but it's good to see
[05:13:22] that everything's getting on track there
[05:13:26] are no longer any voices of
[05:13:29] Suspicion maybe this is fine
[05:13:32] I just need to keep going and everyone
[05:13:36] will be
[05:13:38] saved all right finina don't think too
[05:13:42] hard about this you need rest tomorrow's

[05:14:01] a summary of the
[05:14:03] followup there'll be no need for that
[05:14:07] I've seen them already there's no need
[05:14:10] to go back over scenes I've witnessed in
[05:14:12] person before true why are you giving
[05:14:13] her the reports dumb
[05:14:16] idiot lady

[05:14:57] is nothing to worry about I just don't
[05:15:01] know when these days will end I feel
[05:15:04] utterly

[05:15:53] like this I've heard that the first time
[05:15:55] 500 years who was honored to receive an
[05:15:57] audience with you was Madame dearia
[05:16:00] almost many generations
[05:16:05] ago and what a fine family yours is
[05:16:08] indeed it brings me great joy to meet
[05:16:12] such a faithful believer a descendant of
[05:16:15] a line most
[05:16:18] Ardent surely you exaggerate lady Farina

[05:16:31] people that are annoying you just kill
[05:16:33] their entire lineage and in game and
[05:16:35] then you have font just a bunch of cool
[05:16:37] people and then you're the archon and

[05:16:44] lady huh okay don't do that good
[05:16:48] citizen are are you crying are you are
[05:16:51] you advocating I'm not advocating for it
[05:16:54] I'm saying finina could have but she
[05:16:55] didn't which is good good for her I'm
[05:16:58] glad she didn't I'm glad she didn't
[05:17:02] this must be the Overflow of hydro from
[05:17:04] my
[05:17:05] person well can't quite help being the
[05:17:08] god whose Dominion is the waters can
[05:17:12] I no wonder no wonder a manifestation of
[05:17:17] your power then oh Aron I am honored to
[05:17:20] have witnessed it honored
[05:17:24] [Music]
[05:17:27] indeed so
[05:17:30] interminable
[05:17:35] so
[05:17:37] lonely just how much
[05:17:41] longer hundreds of years must have
[05:17:44] passed by
[05:17:45] now perhaps The Show Must Go On for
[05:17:49] hundreds more I never
[05:17:52] imagined that it would hurt so
[05:17:57] much have
[05:17:59] I reached my
[05:18:03] limit
[05:18:05] no perhaps I reached it long
[05:18:09] ago today I didn't even notice my own
[05:18:14] tears I want to tell someone anyone
[05:18:19] about
[05:18:20] this but would that not destroy all I've
[05:18:24] done so
[05:18:26] far I've conducted so many
[05:18:29] investigations across the
[05:18:32] centuries but there's not even a sliver
[05:18:36] of hope that we might break the
[05:18:39] prophecy all I can do is keep
[05:18:43] heart I must maintain this
[05:18:47] act it is the only way to save
[05:18:52] Fontaine please mirror
[05:18:55] me you have to
[05:18:59] succeed B
[05:19:06] finina
[05:19:13] and finina you don't have to shoulder
[05:19:16] this burden alone although I don't know
[05:19:19] what you might be keeping from everyone
[05:19:21] your people are more than willing to
[05:19:23] share your burden with
[05:19:30] you
[05:19:32] I think see play Inner world I find what
[05:19:34] you want to tell me my
[05:19:37] burden that's impossible it was faded
[05:19:41] right from the start that this would be
[05:19:43] my duty alone but even if your burden
[05:19:46] doesn't need to be shared you can still
[05:19:49] choose to confide in someone just share
[05:19:52] it with me I'm what You' call a witness
[05:19:56] a
[05:19:58] witness yes I've heard that you came to
[05:20:01] tat from beyond the stars yes in other
[05:20:05] words you never belonged here and if tat
[05:20:09] is in its entirety a show on a stage
[05:20:13] then you're just a spectator aren't
[05:20:17] you if that's the
[05:20:22] case she's right I could confide in her
[05:20:27] she was literally about to and I got
[05:20:29] [ __ ] ruined if things don't play out
[05:20:31] as
[05:20:32] expected the people of Fontaine will be
[05:20:34] the ones to pay the price no finina you
[05:20:39] shouldn't bro fin is the only character
[05:20:40] that can make me stop
[05:20:42] talking but what
[05:20:44] if what if it's really all right finina
[05:20:49] you've worked so hard for so so
[05:20:53] long surely it would be okay to put
[05:20:55] yourself first for
[05:20:57] once just this once is it such an
[05:21:01] outrageous thing to do anyway to find
[05:21:04] someone in whom you can confide to your
[05:21:06] fris bro why do we do this a day
[05:21:09] earlier surely we could have been her
[05:21:12] friend if you let this opportunity slip
[05:21:15] through your fingers it might never come
[05:21:18] by again think about it why don't we
[05:21:21] just go to we should have went from
[05:21:22] monat straight to Fontan skip sumaru
[05:21:25] skip inauma
[05:21:27] just swim
[05:21:30] there
[05:21:38] [Music]
[05:21:41] no I have nothing to say I am finina the
[05:21:46] archon of
[05:21:47] Fontaine everything will surely get
[05:21:50] better mind all you need to do dear
[05:21:53] spectator is to witness my performance
[05:21:56] until the curtains
[05:21:59] fall
[05:22:15] fine oh lum's
[05:22:20] pissed
[05:22:24] s so even finina doesn't know the truth
[05:22:27] you've never once let her in on the full
[05:22:29] plan yeah yes it had to be done to
[05:22:33] deceive the Heavenly principles you must
[05:22:36] first deceive
[05:22:38] yourself she did very well if she had
[05:22:41] let her resolve falter even once in
[05:22:44] these five centuries Fontaine would have
[05:22:47] been doomed to the most tragic fate it
[05:22:51] seems that trusting Humanity was the
[05:22:54] right decision after all I believe that
[05:22:58] I understand how your deception works
[05:23:01] but that is only half the truth is it
[05:23:03] not how would you build on this
[05:23:05] Foundation to save the people of
[05:23:07] Fontaine true that is the most important
[05:23:10] thing true ah good good you better have
[05:23:14] a good you better have a good
[05:23:15] explanation Fontaine has pinpointed the
[05:23:17] Crux of the issue Crux I'm sure you've
[05:23:20] long sense that the orrice is no simple
[05:23:23] machine yes I've always suspected that
[05:23:27] it had its own Consciousness and Lenny
[05:23:29] did mention that he heard a human voice
[05:23:31] within the core chamber it now seems
[05:23:34] that that person was you hidden within
[05:23:37] the machine all alone am I right and
[05:23:40] then I became one with the
[05:23:43] orries taking fontaine's nosis with me
[05:23:47] yes it would seem so wouldn't it alas
[05:23:51] your understanding of this device still
[05:23:54] lack sufficient depth in truth it is no
[05:23:58] enactor of Justice it is in fact a
[05:24:03] device created to kill the God of
[05:24:08] Justice I beg your pardon the [ __ ] is
[05:24:12] happening you have it and to be more
[05:24:16] precise not only will the orrice take
[05:24:19] down the God of Justice it will also
[05:24:22] take down the Divine Throne upon which
[05:24:25] she has been
[05:24:27] placed I mean did you think I I would be
[05:24:31] the sort to enjoy peaceful Repose Mal
[05:24:34] Farina suffered my work over these last
[05:24:38] 500 years has been to constantly
[05:24:41] accumulate indom nidum within the
[05:24:43] orries but really some have already
[05:24:47] discovered that only a small fraction of
[05:24:49] the energy generated by the device was
[05:24:51] ever used to provide Power to
[05:24:54] Fontaine the vast majority has been had
[05:24:58] to be accumulated
[05:25:01] to enact this death sentence it was all
[05:25:06] part of your plan then both the trial
[05:25:08] and the sentence indeed this power acred
[05:25:13] over five centuries could have sustained
[05:25:17] fontans for Millennia had it only been
[05:25:20] used for that purpose almost all of it
[05:25:23] has now been stored within the
[05:25:25] orries but only Power of this magnitude
[05:25:29] could hope to destroy destroy the hydro
[05:25:31] archon's Divine Throne shaking the rules
[05:25:35] established by [ __ ] the system and
[05:25:38] breaking through the institution that is
[05:25:40] the seven so the orrice call for death
[05:25:43] was for neither finina nor falor but for
[05:25:46] the hydro
[05:25:48] archon the destruction of that Divine
[05:25:51] Throne if I do not misunderstand your
[05:25:54] intent you must be returning what's
[05:25:57] rightfully yours to you of course wait
[05:26:00] what in other words this was all done to
[05:26:04] return the authority of the hydro archon
[05:26:06] to the Hydro Dragon of this
[05:26:09] planet
[05:26:12] but wait no wonder never that's [ __ ]
[05:26:19] Broken Oh what getting sad again are we
[05:26:24] the authority of the ancient dragons
[05:26:26] shall soon be yours once more oh Hydro
[05:26:29] Dragon Sovereign and this is the face
[05:26:33] you
[05:26:34] make
[05:26:36] D f' done throughout the years it's just
[05:26:40] wait let us pull for her before she dies
[05:26:42] the very
[05:26:44] end I've never quite seen it that way
[05:26:47] you know even now I'm quite pleased at
[05:26:50] how well my deception
[05:26:59] worked
[05:27:05] hydr dragon hydr dragon don't
[05:27:13] cry I must say had it been within my
[05:27:16] rights I would have loved to judge the
[05:27:19] Heavenly principles themselves were they
[05:27:22] not guilty of essentially the same crime
[05:27:26] aeria stole the power of the primordial
[05:27:29] sea and the Heavenly principle stole the
[05:27:32] power you ancient dragons
[05:27:34] possessed I for my part am the god of
[05:27:38] justice and is it not just that your
[05:27:41] original Powers should be returned to
[05:27:44] you speaking of Justice I have always
[05:27:48] believed that Justice lies in the
[05:27:50] process of pursuing human existence
[05:27:53] itself so if the theft of the primordial
[05:27:56] se's might was fontaine's Original Sin
[05:28:00] then leaving matters of procedural right
[05:28:03] and wrong aside The Descent of the
[05:28:05] fontans as humans and their right to
[05:28:08] exist in this world would be fontaine's
[05:28:11] original
[05:28:13] Justice in other words existence was
[05:28:17] egeria Justice and to me Justice is the
[05:28:22] continuation of that existence okay
[05:28:25] defying the prophecy and ensuring that
[05:28:28] fontaine's people shall live on
[05:28:31] that should be the Justice enthroned
[05:28:33] over all others at this point we whether
[05:28:39] it be myself or all other
[05:28:43] fontans have shouldered the burden of
[05:28:46] this sin for far too long udex net the
[05:28:52] highest judge in our land when you
[05:28:55] regain your full power as an elemental
[05:28:59] sovereign what verdict shall you pass
[05:29:02] upon us so when I was invited to the
[05:29:05] court of Fontaine to serve as
[05:29:07] udex I see now that that was your idea
[05:29:11] too at last I Now understand the true
[05:29:15] purpose behind this position in the
[05:29:17] beginning I was uninterested in human
[05:29:20] existence but these five centuries of
[05:29:23] living alongside them have gradually
[05:29:24] brought about Mutual understanding
[05:29:26] between us and I have even attempted to
[05:29:29] feeled as they feel you are a devious
[05:29:33] one for salor that was a pretty [ __ ]
[05:29:35] 5D plan things being as they are surely
[05:29:39] you know that I could never declare them
[05:29:41] to be
[05:29:49] guilty
[05:29:51] yo the hour of execution is almost oh my
[05:29:54] God she's dead for The Sinner The
[05:29:57] Curtain Call has come at least give us a
[05:29:59] skin
[05:30:00] I know I may not sound it but faced with
[05:30:04] death I find myself a little
[05:30:07] afraid perhaps this is one thing both
[05:30:10] gods and humans have in
[05:30:18] common farewell
[05:30:21] nervet I hope you've enjoyed the part
[05:30:23] you played these 500
[05:30:29] years
[05:30:32] [Music]
[05:30:46] Chad can I Al that four before he
[05:30:48] [Music]
[05:30:59] dies
[05:31:10] wait why did Finas
[05:31:22] [Music]

[05:32:12] nevertheless I udex selet hereby
[05:32:18] declare people of Fontaine your sins are
[05:32:29] forgiven
[05:32:46] studge bro what
[05:32:58] the
[05:33:05] BR what just
[05:33:07] happened has the death sentence been
[05:33:10] carried out what the [ __ ] was that is
[05:33:12] that bright light some also we still
[05:33:13] have a m skirk so the quest isn't even
[05:33:16] over but since we're all still alive and
[05:33:19] haven't been dissolved I assume whatever
[05:33:21] happened was good for us it's time to
[05:33:24] end this we must meet out punishment to
[05:33:26] that beast but can you think say just a
[05:33:30] moment ago that it can't be
[05:33:32] defeated I have gained the strength
[05:33:34] sufficient to deal with it through
[05:33:37] certain means I now have the ability to
[05:33:40] separate the power of the primordial Sea
[05:33:42] from that creature we should seize the
[05:33:45] opportunity to pursue our Quarry you
[05:33:48] obtained power just now now that the or
[05:33:51] can no longer function I require an
[05:33:53] Executor to help me meet out Justice me
[05:33:56] the root of the calamities befalling

[05:34:36] we're going to execute it but how are we
[05:34:39] going to do that it's
[05:34:42] huge I've already done my best to
[05:34:44] separate the power from my see from the
[05:34:46] way considering the size of feast I
[05:34:49] cannot reach the power source wait we
[05:34:51] still haven't seen where Fin's outfits
[05:34:53] come from right find way to she's only
[05:34:54] white in the I shall share an dragon's
[05:34:58] power with you we shall look for an
[05:35:00] opening to

[05:35:50] [Music]
[05:35:53] player why is there a well this
[05:35:56] soundtrack is [ __ ]
[05:35:57] sick really scary

[05:36:08] before may I
[05:36:12] present
[05:36:17] behold I have granted you my protection
[05:36:20] do not fear seize the moment and use my
[05:36:24] power toess wait did I not just apply
[05:36:25] usia to it I did right okay let's kill
[05:36:28] it now
[05:36:33] cry
[05:36:35] louder The Wind
[05:36:55] Rises the fact that this whale looks
[05:36:58] Hydro but it's not Hydro immune proves
[05:37:00] that the void element will come in
[05:37:03] time we will be getting a void character
[05:37:06] or because this whale is void true or
[05:37:09] Abyss whatever Abyss
[05:37:12] element the
[05:37:15] [ __ ]
[05:37:22] oh did she just throw
[05:37:26] CH wait that other outfit was wait is it
[05:37:29] the same outfit what the [ __ ] wait
[05:37:32] thanks for helping with the cleanup it
[05:37:34] should have been my job but respectfully
[05:37:37] respectfully respectfully
[05:37:39] respectfully this side is so much cooler
[05:37:41] I'm sorry this looks sick compared to
[05:37:43] the I mean I guess they're both cool
[05:37:44] butling in the
[05:37:46] meantime I like that color palette a lot
[05:37:49] better move your cam why I'm literally
[05:37:52] blocking
[05:37:56] nothing yeah it's
[05:37:58] jingu
[05:38:03] anyways
[05:38:06] uh well actually I had a feeling that it
[05:38:09] would happen at some point but they
[05:38:11] bumped into one another earlier than I
[05:38:14] thought what a
[05:38:16] blunder I suppose I'll have to swing my
[05:38:18] sword three million times as
[05:38:21] Penance yeah I mean I've talked about
[05:38:22] this before I think she looks good I
[05:38:24] think she looks a little
[05:38:26] too how do I say this I think her face
[05:38:28] is a little too young to be like the
[05:38:30] [ __ ] child Master that's been in the
[05:38:33] void for like [ __ ] 28 Millennia but I
[05:38:36] still think she looks sick so disciple
[05:38:38] your Master's pet that power who are you
[05:38:46] exactly Pon has an idea from what she
[05:38:49] said earlier she must be child's Master
[05:38:51] maybe she looks like she's from honai
[05:38:54] cuz she's in the abyss right and then
[05:38:56] the last region of genin we go to the
[05:38:59] Abyss then what happens the final quest
[05:39:02] D's Leaf comes out we meet our twin we
[05:39:05] fight we end up close our eyes wake up
[05:39:08] welcome aboard the astral Express we go
[05:39:11] into star it continues from
[05:39:17] genshin yo what if the last planet in
[05:39:19] star that we explore is
[05:39:23] Monsta is that even monat no it's not
[05:39:27] it's just that he has the impression
[05:39:28] that she was
[05:39:30] um's look at her eyes look I simply did
[05:39:34] not have anything to say to they're
[05:39:35] [ __ ] like red pink black
[05:39:38] pink shut up manag to defeat the all
[05:39:42] devouring narwhal without using power
[05:39:44] from Beyond this
[05:39:47] world she is pretty cool though like you
[05:39:49] may speak to me as color palette
[05:39:52] wise what sort of person would take the
[05:39:54] all devouring narwhal as a pet I have to
[05:39:58] agree it's a strange use of a planet's
[05:40:01] primordial Waters just to raise an all
[05:40:03] devouring
[05:40:04] narwhal that kind of power is wasted on
[05:40:07] it it's not Cooperative it eats too much
[05:40:10] and I have more important things to do
[05:40:12] with my chill the only thing that
[05:40:14] creature has going for it is its looks
[05:40:18] all in all it fails as a pet hey if you
[05:40:21] need a new pet Miss SK I'm sorry I think
[05:40:24] you might have missed the point the
[05:40:27] point being well being that this pet
[05:40:31] almost destroyed an entire
[05:40:35] nation so what sort of person is your
[05:40:37] master those legs are sick child's
[05:40:40] Master's
[05:40:41] Master wait is that right if she is like
[05:40:44] a different element like [ __ ] Quantum
[05:40:46] imaginary void whatever whatever that
[05:40:48] element is that's the best element
[05:40:49] that's my favorite element whatever it
[05:40:50] is it's like imagine they make a Geo
[05:40:53] imagine the only reaction you could do
[05:40:54] is avoid crystallize I'm going to show
[05:40:56] up move cam
[05:40:58] sorry I mean I don't know where to put
[05:41:03] it right I'm blocking net whatever sorry
[05:41:07] I assumed you did his name is C
[05:41:12] Loi Cal
[05:41:14] Loi oh I knew that I I know about this
[05:41:16] yeah I know I know about
[05:41:19] him okay I don't who the [ __ ] is Cal
[05:41:25] Loi wait her earrings
[05:41:28] cool
[05:41:31] sounds like a type of pasta dude that's
[05:41:33] [ __ ] you can't say that what dude dude
[05:41:37] dude you
[05:41:39] can't okay
[05:41:44] who I am unfamiliar with that
[05:41:49] name it's not Auto my bad so Master is
[05:41:52] insufficiently
[05:41:54] famous wait the foul how should I
[05:41:57] describe him then oh wait have you heard
[05:42:00] of that's one of the fatou right no I
[05:42:01] don't know actually I could be coping
[05:42:03] foul I know the fool the
[05:42:06] jesture oh foul
[05:42:08] Legacy it's I still don't know who that
[05:42:11] is though but I know that this foul
[05:42:13] Legacy that's all I know near then or
[05:42:17] gold Rin
[05:42:19] daughter that one we've heard Rin
[05:42:21] daughter's part of the Bro imagine
[05:42:22] having Al's mom right wait albo's mom
[05:42:25] what the [ __ ] imagine having eight names
[05:42:27] and no one knowing who you are
[05:42:31] sorry you're blocking skirk my
[05:42:40] bad lore Skipper no I actually dude I I
[05:42:43] didn't know who one character was and
[05:42:45] then people were like bro it was
[05:42:46] revealed in child's trailer child's
[05:42:48] trailer Was Out 3 years ago do you
[05:42:51] expect me to go back and re I'm sorry I
[05:42:53] actually do every day I watch it uh so
[05:42:56] yeah I knew
[05:42:58] that dude I I'll go here no
[05:43:03] I are you happy
[05:43:06] now so you do know that name to be
[05:43:09] honest I also heard all of those names
[05:43:11] and titles from my master I don't
[05:43:14] actually know them
[05:43:15] either it's not Auto my bad but I
[05:43:17] suppose you understand now yes my master
[05:43:21] is likely a similar sort to rauter they
[05:43:24] are both pursuing some form of
[05:43:26] perfection wait did you also mention of
[05:43:29] visionary person myman didn't quite
[05:43:32] catch their
[05:43:33] name actually never mind that I believe
[05:43:36] it expedient to inform you that the all
[05:43:39] devouring narwhal used up nearly all its
[05:43:41] strength fighting you such roing Hydro
[05:43:44] energies will prove difficult for the
[05:43:46] planet's deep seas to digest as such the
[05:43:49] Fontaine back on the surface has most
[05:43:51] likely been thrown into
[05:43:54] chaos the prophecy that you've been
[05:43:56] fretting over should not swing
[05:44:00] what no there's little to be surprised
[05:44:03] about Pon it's natural after all the
[05:44:05] prophecy should surely come true we knew
[05:44:07] this and accepted
[05:44:10] it
[05:44:11] however not to worry falor has already
[05:44:16] managed to deceive the Heavenly
[05:44:21] principles that's true actually what
[05:44:24] Loris why do you the people will all be
[05:44:26] dissolved into the waters why are you

[05:48:18] future old soil can still give birth to
[05:48:21] new Bloom Miss Navia stated hope is like
[05:48:24] seeing a small cookie when you're

[05:48:29] Skyship winglet Boer bin of the Fontaine
[05:48:32] Research Institute the various disputes

[05:49:10] enthralling huh the steam Bird's idea
[05:49:13] was pretty simple with a disaster just
[05:49:16] having passed we would print a free
[05:49:18] edition packed to the margins with good
[05:49:20] news to calm people down the value for
[05:49:23] these big Scoops lies in their
[05:49:24] inevitable follow-ups we'll publish
[05:49:26] further reports and go into the stories

[05:59:00] to apologize but that ship is presently
[05:59:02] in the bowels of our Factory I'm afraid

[06:00:19] same other than that flying ship I got a
[06:00:24] than that flying ship that's why I
[06:00:26] decided to let the interview go through

[06:02:21] using Mr Jer and Miss Line's Shields you

[06:03:26] us
[06:03:28] CH what if we made an account where we
[06:03:29] can use way points and then every Quest
[06:03:31] step like this we'd have to swim all the
[06:03:40] way you would never I wouldn't I
[06:03:44] actually

[06:06:23] everyone the moment she realized I had
[06:06:25] something to say to you h
[06:06:28] so how have things been traveler I'm
[06:06:30] doing all right father says that you did
[06:06:32] a great deal during the latest events
[06:06:34] she's very grateful for your
[06:06:36] contributions to Fontaine hey if Aro
[06:06:38] would like to meet you more than happy
[06:06:40] to help oh I guess you haven't
[06:06:43] heard well after lady finina left father
[06:06:48] and Miss nervet opened negotiations
[06:06:50] during which he gave fontaine's nosis to
[06:06:52] her as a diplomatic
[06:06:55] gift are you [ __ ] kidding me are you
[06:07:00] [ __ ]
[06:07:02] joking Nita gave the
[06:07:05] té
[06:07:07] two and then nevet gives arino one what
[06:07:13] the [ __ ] am I going to do what the [ __ ]
[06:07:15] am I going to do when I have to fight
[06:07:17] all the [ __ ] fouille harbingers okay
[06:07:20] what it's not going to be their battle
[06:07:22] it's not going to be Nita's fight it's
[06:07:24] not going to be [ __ ] Net's fight it's
[06:07:25] going to be mine I'm going to have to
[06:07:27] fight
[06:07:28] them yes I was quite surprised at first
[06:07:32] myself but when I thought it over there
[06:07:34] were actually a number of things going
[06:07:36] for
[06:07:37] it if arino asked me for anything I
[06:07:40] would do it yeah me too actually you're
[06:07:42] right Bas it could been done as an
[06:07:44] apology for the incident with Lord child
[06:07:46] or as thanks for his help in tying the
[06:07:48] all devouring narwhal Town yeah I mean
[06:07:50] he did help with an narwhal but then
[06:07:51] give it to child also to F you don't
[06:07:55] even care about child she was like oh
[06:07:57] yeah
[06:08:00] him well that's true but this is a nois
[06:08:04] we're talking about doesn't this seem a
[06:08:06] bit
[06:08:09] irresponsible I would agree but I've
[06:08:11] also heard that it seems that M imagine
[06:08:15] AR was like the sky is fake and then NE
[06:08:18] was like take the sorry let's keep going
[06:08:22] so there's some reason for this that
[06:08:24] only nervet knows about I suspect you'll
[06:08:27] have to ask him about that yourself H
[06:08:31] yes speaking of which I did see him
[06:08:33] strolling around the entrance to the
[06:08:34] Fortress of meped a while back uh isn't
[06:08:38] he real busy and stuff P didn't think
[06:08:41] he' but back to the topic the nosis was
[06:08:44] given to the Nave right what about child
[06:08:47] they say that he's returned to sah to
[06:08:49] recover from his wounds I hear disaster
[06:08:53] really did a number on his
[06:08:55] health I guess I call one of my waries
[06:08:57] that's true when you think about it
[06:08:59] we've had loads of runin with the foule
[06:09:02] to think we'd be allied with them this
[06:09:04] time so shocked by such a simple
[06:09:07] switching of
[06:09:10] sides thought those AR likein know oh it
[06:09:13] is okay I was like I did hey that voice
[06:09:15] I was like I heard that
[06:09:16] before hey well well what do you know

[06:09:44] with sides in concerns not a single
[06:09:47] place or person but the entire world
[06:09:50] with such a grand goal in mind it is
[06:09:53] inevitable that we must wear many masks
[06:09:56] switch she speaks like a villain too is
[06:09:58] something I've always done she's got a
[06:10:01] Down Will you keep to your position well
[06:10:04] that depends on many things no one truly

[06:14:28] hey nevet honored to meet you
[06:14:32] again so you really are here net H
[06:14:35] didn't think you were going to have free
[06:14:37] time this hour of the
[06:14:39] day really oh I suppose you must have
[06:14:42] met Mr Linny he took the time to greet
[06:14:45] me earlier when he passed this way in
[06:14:48] any case you came at a good time I was
[06:14:50] just considering reaching out to you to
[06:14:52] set up a meeting so I may explain some
[06:14:54] things that I haven't had the time to
[06:14:55] before
[06:14:57] A's glad that you remembered all right
[06:15:00] let's have it then how is Fontaine
[06:15:02] actually saved oh this part of the
[06:15:04] archon quest a mystery to us at least
[06:15:06] net explains it to
[06:15:08] us it is strange how words can often
[06:15:11] leave a bitter taste in the mouth when
[06:15:13] it finally comes time to say them out
[06:15:22] loud
[06:15:25] s
[06:15:27] oh so that's what
[06:15:30] happened FAL Lord destroyed the Divine
[06:15:32] Throne of the hydro Aron and restored
[06:15:35] your power to you transforming you into
[06:15:37] a fully fledged Elemental Dragon
[06:15:40] Sovereign but Pon still doesn't quite
[06:15:43] get what you did to save the fontans
[06:15:45] from dissolving for me the authority of
[06:15:48] the ancient dragons refers to absolute
[06:15:50] control over the hydro element fontans
[06:15:53] were incomplete humans born of aeria use
[06:15:56] of the power of the primordial sea with
[06:15:58] constitutions similar to that of mimics
[06:16:01] but so long as those primordial energies
[06:16:04] remain within them I could use the
[06:16:06] ancient dragon's authority to grant them
[06:16:08] True Blood after the fashion in which
[06:16:11] life was first brought into being on
[06:16:13] this planet in other words when I gave
[06:16:15] my verdict fontans became true humans
[06:16:19] and thus he literally performed human
[06:16:21] Alchemy by water from the primordial sea
[06:16:24] for what could equal the value of a
[06:16:25] human
[06:16:27] that decision as well your verdict was
[06:16:29] the key to making the prophecy appear to
[06:16:31] have come true while saving everyone
[06:16:35] transmutation you could say it was at
[06:16:37] that moment that the fontans were
[06:16:38] finally truly born yeah and in a manner
[06:16:41] of speaking F finally managed to fulfill
[06:16:43] the original Hydro Aran wish to turn
[06:16:46] oids into real
[06:16:48] people it seems from your Expressions
[06:16:51] that you still have more things you wish
[06:16:52] to ask ask away I will tell you the
[06:16:55] truth as I know know
[06:16:57] it about the initial verdict that was
[06:16:59] passed on chill day I have investigated
[06:17:01] his case along many Avenues and I have
[06:17:03] learned that he once fell into an
[06:17:05] unknown Chasm when he was young there by
[06:17:08] chance he awakened the all devouring
[06:17:10] narwhal but whether it be by sentiment
[06:17:13] or reason that should not have been
[06:17:14] enough to consider him the root cause of
[06:17:16] the disaster at most he would have had
[06:17:19] tangential liability as for the Judgment
[06:17:22] passed by the orrice during the trial
[06:17:24] whether it was due to that liability by
[06:17:26] association or falor deliberately using
[06:17:29] him to buy time for us on the assumption
[06:17:32] that he would be able to hold the
[06:17:33] creature off I cannot say guess falur
[06:17:36] had fontans in mind the whole time in
[06:17:39] the end it was thanks to her that they
[06:17:40] finally became real humans H hang on a
[06:17:44] second Pon suddenly got another question
[06:17:46] back when fontans hadn't yet become real
[06:17:48] humans were the children they had also
[06:17:51] transformed o life has always flowed
[06:17:54] like water do you recall how fontans
[06:17:57] would often come to the Fountain of
[06:17:59] Lucine to pray for children no I just
[06:18:01] got here I literally arrived in Fon like
[06:18:03] a week AG all the waters in Fontaine
[06:18:06] converge in truth even those couples did
[06:18:08] not know that such prayers were no mere
[06:18:10] custom instead a form of ritual those
[06:18:14] oids who were blessed within the spring
[06:18:16] water would later descend as new humans
[06:18:18] in the coming
[06:18:19] months uh Pon sort of gets it now what
[06:18:25] is the music so goofy won't be of any
[06:18:27] further use but it'll probably live on
[06:18:29] as a local custom ask away I will tell
[06:18:33] you the truth as I know it fontan's
[06:18:35] future yeah about that rley said finina
[06:18:39] has already left left what's that all
[06:18:41] about did I not listen to rly man I'm
[06:18:43] tired the people are only aware that her
[06:18:45] death sentence has not been carried out
[06:18:48] she abdicated the post of hydro Aron and
[06:18:50] left Affairs related to that title to me
[06:18:53] before leaving the opera house I related
[06:18:55] f 's words to her faithfully and
[06:18:57] completely after hearing them she seemed
[06:18:59] neither saddened nor comforted she
[06:19:02] simply said that she was tired and
[06:19:05] needed to rest Des having said that she
[06:19:07] then packed her things and moved out of
[06:19:08] the Opera House not unlike how an
[06:19:10] ordinary person might um but she still
[06:19:14] got a place to stay
[06:19:16] right you need not worry I will make
[06:19:19] arrangements to ensure that she will not
[06:19:21] want for food clothing board or travel
[06:19:24] in truth I am somewhat happy for her the
[06:19:27] wear and tear on her spirit will of
[06:19:28] course take time to heal but now that
[06:19:31] she no longer has to play the role of
[06:19:33] fos or the hydro archon she can finally
[06:19:36] lay down her burdens and lead a normal
[06:19:38] life what about you then what are your
[06:19:41] plans now that you've regained your full
[06:19:43] Powers as the Hydro Dragon after falor
[06:19:46] passed on the orri also ceased to
[06:19:49] function this matter will directly
[06:19:51] affect our trials after much careful
[06:19:53] consideration I've decided to take over
[06:19:55] its role in our courts from now on I
[06:19:58] shall hear cases and pass verdicts by
[06:20:00] myself looks like you're still
[06:20:02] considering stuff from the perspective
[06:20:04] of the udex huh as an Elemental Dragon
[06:20:07] there are indeed many things that I must
[06:20:09] do but this power in this Duty in a
[06:20:13] manner of speaking you could say that
[06:20:15] both were granted to me as such before I
[06:20:18] attend to my other responsibilities I
[06:20:20] must first and foremost continue to
[06:20:22] serve Fontaine as its highest judge the
[06:20:24] duty of the hydro Sovereign and the duty
[06:20:26] of the udex shall coexist within my
[06:20:29] person Additionally the hydro archon's
[06:20:32] departure has brought about another
[06:20:33] problem which is that the opera house
[06:20:35] shall no longer produce indem nidum
[06:20:38] that's true that power was derived from
[06:20:40] the people's faith in the hydro icon
[06:20:42] wasn't it wait but the various Max
[06:20:45] machines in the city are he's like Alam
[06:20:47] but also a dragon are they getting their
[06:20:49] energy
[06:20:50] from didn't from I told you full command
[06:20:52] of new musia this character is insane
[06:20:56] substitute another reason why I cannot
[06:20:58] quite leave F so I'll probably back in
[06:21:00] like [ __ ] two three patches this
[06:21:02] ancient dragon's Authority stuff is
[06:21:04] really quite useful huh ask away I will
[06:21:07] tell you the truth as I know
[06:21:10] it lost my 5050 what do you want me to
[06:21:12] do do you try winning the 50/50 about
[06:21:14] the noos yeah actually where did your
[06:21:16] nooses go oh that's right they say
[06:21:19] you've given it to the na as a leaving
[06:21:21] aside their intentionality the two
[06:21:23] fouille harbingers have indeed done much
[06:21:24] for us during this grou you better have
[06:21:26] a good explanation you better have a
[06:21:28] good explanation do you know who else
[06:21:29] did a lot for us do you know who else
[06:21:30] did a lot for us me sorry the solar me
[06:21:34] golden font at least at this point would
[06:21:36] seem to be the nois the orrice has
[06:21:38] ceased to function the hydro archon's
[06:21:40] Divine Throne is now no more and I do
[06:21:43] not need theosis power yeah do you know
[06:21:46] who does need it the [ __ ] fouille
[06:21:49] harbingers the the [ __ ] main villains
[06:21:52] bro the
[06:21:53] why as such it is lost all meaning for
[06:21:56] Fontaine if the fatou have impure
[06:21:59] designs we might as well acceed to their
[06:22:01] requests now and avoid unnecessary
[06:22:05] conflict what complicated considerations
[06:22:08] pman thought you were just giving it why
[06:22:10] are you guys trying to convince me
[06:22:11] they're not villains listen I if I could
[06:22:13] side with the fouille I would you think
[06:22:15] I care they're [ __ ] cooler than
[06:22:17] anyone else I would side with them I'm
[06:22:19] just saying we literally had to give up
[06:22:22] two for dor to stop [ __ ] murdering
[06:22:25] innocent children basically tldr so
[06:22:28] literally it's
[06:22:30] okay ask away I will tell you the truth
[06:22:33] as I know
[06:22:37] it that's not what he did
[06:22:42] but that's the
[06:22:45] Tor about the next step on my journey
[06:22:48] wait a second what the [ __ ] is this
[06:22:49] literally the end of font font en you
[06:22:52] soon be heading to naton I
[06:22:54] presume I'm afraid that I have little
[06:22:56] time travel
[06:22:59] guide this region just came
[06:23:01] out as far as I'm aware naton can be
[06:23:05] said to be a nation of
[06:23:07] dragons a nation of dragons you mean
[06:23:11] like you no I suspect that I would not
[06:23:13] find myself welcomed there wait why
[06:23:16] unlike ancient dragons such as myself
[06:23:18] the dragons of naton have undergone long
[06:23:21] years of development and evolution wait
[06:23:22] that's sick of them have entered a form
[06:23:25] of coexistence with humanity naton is
[06:23:28] also the nation of war war ravages those
[06:23:31] lands like an undying flame there is one
[06:23:34] other piece of information I got
[06:23:36] incidentally from my negotiations with
[06:23:38] the Nave that I believe may be useful to
[06:23:39] you the harbinger known as the captain
[06:23:42] has thrown his hat into the endless Ring
[06:23:45] Of War Yes
[06:23:47] capit sounds like a real tough customer
[06:23:50] seriously everywhere you look there's a
[06:23:52] fat Harbinger doing their thing I
[06:23:55] suggest that you fully prepare yourself
[06:23:57] before going to naton in the
[06:24:00] meantime doors will always be open to
[06:24:05] you ask away I will tell you the truth
[06:24:08] as I F wait there's no way that's the
[06:24:10] end of [ __ ] Fontan surely we get more
[06:24:12] yo do Arkham Quest usually end in x
[06:24:15] point2 the [ __ ] surely we get more Carri
[06:24:18] bar is
[06:24:21] like yeah it
[06:24:24] does
[06:24:26] there an interlude D's Leaf an interlude
[06:24:28] oh I see
[06:24:31] okay
[06:24:34] D yeah I miss Dan's
[06:24:39] Leaf I think the only time I'm going to
[06:24:41] do a quest not in English is if D Leaf's
[06:24:44] a main part I might put it Japanese just
[06:24:46] cuz I I'm sorry I I
[06:24:50] get the Japanese Dan Leaf makes my tip
[06:24:53] creamy why did I say that I'm tired I

[06:25:01] if you heard him you would say the same
[06:25:04] respectfully about the next step on my
[06:25:06] journey you'll soon be heading to Natan
[06:25:08] I
[06:25:09] presume I'm afraid that I have little
[06:25:11] Talent as a travel guide I already I
[06:25:13] already talk about this aware a nation
[06:25:15] of dragon question mark bro listen to
[06:25:19] him unlike ancient dragons such as
[06:25:21] myself the dragons of naton have
[06:25:24] undergone long years years of
[06:25:25] development and evolution large numbers
[06:25:28] of them have entered a form of
[06:25:29] coexistence
[06:25:32] humanity
[06:25:38] listen it's loading okay well my video
[06:25:40] is not working anymore well whatever
[06:25:43] never
[06:25:44] [Music]
[06:25:52] mind
[06:25:54] any naton is Al there is one other The
[06:25:57] Harbinger known as the I suggest that
[06:26:00] you I will tell you the truth as I
[06:26:03] know nice internet boo so regarding this
[06:26:07] I know getting ready to share something
[06:26:10] with you uh what is it in truth I
[06:26:14] exchanged some further words with that
[06:26:16] lady named skirk after sending you two
[06:26:18] back to the surface it went something
[06:26:20] like
[06:26:24] this
[06:26:35] [Music]
[06:26:38] top side to see what's going on you
[06:26:40] hurry over soon as well all right
[06:26:46] net same one
[06:26:49] animation what next this entire Quest
[06:26:51] he's just
[06:26:54] been the all devouring narwhal isn't
[06:26:57] here so I'm no longer getting any
[06:27:01] interference I can finally catch the
[06:27:03] scent of your power what it's made of it
[06:27:07] is the authority of the planet's
[06:27:09] primordial
[06:27:10] dragons so something very similar to a
[06:27:13] God's curse mixed in it's quite a novel
[06:27:16] blend I'm sure I've encountered
[06:27:18] something like this
[06:27:20] before what was it again I do not know
[06:27:23] what you speak of
[06:27:26] of course how could I forget you should
[06:27:30] have the remains of the Third descender
[06:27:32] on your person yes remains I've never
[06:27:36] heard of any such
[06:27:38] thing huh according to your parlance I
[06:27:42] believe it may be called a
[06:27:45] nosis well that much is true after fal's
[06:27:48] Divinity faded she handed her nosis to
[06:27:50] me but I fear I have never heard of it
[06:27:53] described in the manner that you just
[06:27:54] did
[06:27:56] I've been training with my master F ever
[06:27:58] since I was young and I have never
[06:28:01] returned to the surface since so most of
[06:28:03] the information I possess I got from him
[06:28:07] it is only natural for those who are
[06:28:09] greater than Humanity to possess a
[06:28:11] different sort of Common Sense which is
[06:28:14] why there are so many problems in our
[06:28:16] attempts to communicate with humans
[06:28:18] regardless you should probably get rid
[06:28:21] of objects of Misfortune to prevent any
[06:28:23] disasters from be falling you to live in
[06:28:26] itself is a blessing but once a person
[06:28:30] dies the bonds he once had with this
[06:28:32] world shall all turn to curses what do
[06:28:35] you mean by
[06:28:37] that no need to fret these are just
[06:28:41] my personal
[06:28:43] thoughts she has hair for no longer
[06:28:45] wishing to return to the surface this
[06:28:48] third descender you refer to who are
[06:28:51] they it's so when they die did they die
[06:28:54] turn a curses Master never mentioned
[06:28:56] them but then they she just called The
[06:28:58] Vision a [ __ ] what was it she called
[06:29:00] it a remnant
[06:29:02] of
[06:29:05] like if you die and it leaves a curse
[06:29:08] but you die and it leaves a vision not a
[06:29:10] vision sorry noi does that mean that's a
[06:29:13] curse no
[06:29:15] okay if you're interested though I could
[06:29:18] ask him I'll be sure to pass the answer
[06:29:20] on to you next time next time you
[06:29:24] believe we will nois not Noki my bad I
[06:29:28] do wait I have a disciple of my own
[06:29:32] don't I he can be the messenger
[06:29:37] then wait was I not wait he they
[06:29:39] literally said that
[06:29:45] though that's what she told me whether
[06:29:49] it would prove useful or not I wanted to
[06:29:51] pass from the third descender I see okay
[06:29:54] the remains of I know what that
[06:29:56] means so that's what the okay P I feel
[06:30:00] listen Pon Recaps things in case you're
[06:30:02] a dumbass and you don't pay attention
[06:30:05] and Pon just expl all the same assuming
[06:30:08] that there was no misunder if you if
[06:30:11] whenever that is what she meant to say
[06:30:13] whenever Pyon says something and I learn
[06:30:16] from it I'm like [ __ ] I'm I'm dumb and
[06:30:19] this time my bad well thanks pon pon was
[06:30:22] made for me I guess said that it would
[06:30:24] bring m forun and that you should this
[06:30:26] is like the one time though usually I'm
[06:30:28] good if she speaks the truth then I
[06:30:31] would simply be putting Fontaine at
[06:30:33] unnecessary Risk by keeping it
[06:30:36] here descender she mentioned one of
[06:30:39] them I am the fourth
[06:30:42] descender for me this information means
[06:30:44] two
[06:30:45] things
[06:30:48] uh-oh one that the noses are related to
[06:30:51] the descenders two the ones who came
[06:30:54] before me sorry the one who came before
[06:30:56] me already died I guessed that you might
[06:30:58] already be familiar with this concept
[06:31:00] but I did not expect you to be one of
[06:31:03] them that means that the nois which are
[06:31:06] exceedingly element compatible and can
[06:31:08] even enhance Elemental abilities do
[06:31:11] indeed come from the third
[06:31:15] descender I wonder does your body also
[06:31:18] possess similar
[06:31:20] properties W like uh like being able to
[06:31:25] use elemental powers without a vision
[06:31:28] that does sort of count as special
[06:31:30] compatibility right no no let's not
[06:31:33] think about this stuff right now it just
[06:31:35] I never we can find out sorry comparing
[06:31:38] the traveler to the dead third descender
[06:31:40] and all don't worry I won't die that's
[06:31:42] what you say but this topic still feels
[06:31:44] like bad
[06:31:45] luck once child recovers let's get some
[06:31:48] more answers out of him or go look for
[06:31:50] his master and get the answers that way
[06:31:53] I too believe it unwise to make too many
[06:31:55] blind guesses when information is
[06:31:56] lacking the same is true of being at
[06:31:59] court all right whatever the case it
[06:32:02] seems like the crisis here in fontaine's
[06:32:04] over for now yes all of fal's efforts
[06:32:08] were for this moment as well but she
[06:32:12] sacrificed herself in the end as a God
[06:32:14] and she suffered through all those years
[06:32:16] as a human was that really what she
[06:32:20] wanted I suppose that would be the
[06:32:22] mystery of a God's will okay the will of
[06:32:25] the Gods suspect not but once in a while
[06:32:27] I too would guess that if wishes were
[06:32:29] like the clouds in the sky they will one
[06:32:31] day return to the Earth as
[06:32:33] raindrops life flows like water
[06:32:37] ands like a the water May sometimes tilt
[06:32:41] one way or another but the Falls fairly
[06:32:44] upon all and what ultimately is the
[06:32:47] difference between the rains that fall
[06:32:49] upon all of

[06:43:06] and song but a stage performer requires
[06:43:09] far more skills than just these hey

[06:43:28] saved the entire world dumb
[06:43:32] true yeah finina coming to wind Bloom
[06:43:34] would be sick imagine venty invites her
[06:43:36] she pulls
[06:43:37] up I F
[06:43:41] filor okay wait where are the other
[06:43:43] archons
[06:43:45] Ryden I haven't listened to like any
[06:43:47] ridden voice
[06:43:50] line about morax I had an opportunity to
[06:43:53] Fe with who the [ __ ] is I admire her
[06:43:56] humility it is a sign of true
[06:43:59] wisdom with the power she
[06:44:02] holds capable of
[06:44:05] doing bro yo this is something I learned
[06:44:08] in like 3.1 and forgot bro that was like
[06:44:11] a year ago okay my memory lasts two
[06:44:14] months for five centuries I DED the ride
[06:44:17] in Shogun in my personal Realm Of
[06:44:19] Consciousness to confirm the
[06:44:21] steadfastness of my will
[06:44:24] yet this finina you speak of though
[06:44:27] possessing only a frail human body
[06:44:29] committed herself to acting out her part
[06:44:32] every second of every day for 500 years
[06:44:36] yo the glazing is actually crazy her
[06:44:40] willpower has in bro why isn't she
[06:44:42] glazing everyone else who's been
[06:44:43] suffering for [ __ ] decad not decades
[06:44:46] centuries I mean true though finina did
[06:44:50] do
[06:44:50] that where's wrong Le
[06:44:55] Jonathan what do you think Jonathan
[06:44:58] Lee about ball tempers all
[06:45:01] volition yet she would give up as well
[06:45:04] as ruling over all of suu she made a
[06:45:07] contract with her own self toop talking
[06:45:10] about contract strictly adhered to it
[06:45:11] for over five centuries without once
[06:45:14] wavering and even fooled the Heavenly
[06:45:16] principles in the
[06:45:18] end I have great respect for approaches
[06:45:21] to justice that place exact ing demands
[06:45:24] not only on others but also on the self
[06:45:28] though her Divinity has vanished and the
[06:45:30] Throne of the archan is no more finina
[06:45:33] will go down in fontaine's history as a
[06:45:36] God of Justice worthy of recognition
[06:45:38] true so true Jong Le you speak of the
[06:45:42] young adeptus of guy
[06:45:45] Plains still fulfilling his duty to this
[06:45:48] very day please give this remedium torum
[06:45:52] to him on my
[06:45:54] behalf oh yes be sure not to let Pimon
[06:45:58] eat them nothing of this world can
[06:46:01] withstand the power of this
[06:46:03] medicine bam what type of drugs did he
[06:46:07] give
[06:46:11] Shia what if sh talked about finina he
[06:46:13] doesn't
[06:46:17] S it's too
[06:46:20] late
[06:46:22] Nita
[06:46:29] the first thing she said when she saw me
[06:46:31] was nice palace when he finally achieved
[06:46:34] the ambition he thought he'd been
[06:46:35] pursuing people often say that wisdom
[06:46:37] isn't about what you know than knowing
[06:46:39] what you can change it is beyond
[06:46:42] question that the prophecy was carved
[06:46:44] into man so long ago and while it me
[06:46:47] look like nothing has changed it also
[06:46:50] seems like everything has I think we
[06:46:53] both know her to be smart enough to turn
[06:46:55] the fate of the world
[06:46:57] around
[06:46:59] true I once borrowed someone else's body
[06:47:03] to ask her if she'd mind allowing lesser
[06:47:05] Lord kusali to watch her
[06:47:15] dance claran Peerless skills have made
[06:47:18] her the most powerful Champion duelist
[06:47:20] in our nation now the curtain has
[06:47:23] finally fallen
[06:47:25] on about Linny and Lynette bro they
[06:47:28] forgot about F their performances are
[06:47:31] just fascinating don't you think they
[06:47:33] draw you into a magical world where on
[06:47:36] one hand everything that takes place is
[06:47:38] part of an elaborate deception but on
[06:47:41] the other all manner of Miracles are
[06:47:43] possible if you are only willing to
[06:47:46] believe now the curtain has finally
[06:47:48] fallen on her
[06:47:49] performance the character she portrayed
[06:47:52] was an imaginary one
[06:47:53] yet in playing that role she fulfilled
[06:47:56] her
[06:47:56] duties though she is Meek and full of
[06:47:59] Doubt by Nature she was able to use
[06:48:01] Madness to stiffen her resolve and see
[06:48:04] her Duty through to its
[06:48:06] conclusion the work that she has done
[06:48:08] over the centuries is truly
[06:48:12] immense if she were to ever make a
[06:48:14] return to the stage I should personally
[06:48:16] attend the performance and give her my
[06:48:19] heartfelt
[06:48:20] Applause yes I must do do so when the
[06:48:23] opportunity
[06:48:25] arises I shall fulfill my vow to judge
[06:48:28] as a survivor of the Dragon race who has
[06:48:30] regained my full nothing will stop me
[06:48:32] from rendering judgment though the day
[06:48:34] will come when I put her on trial I must
[06:48:37] commend the god of virger on her sense
[06:48:39] of
[06:48:40] responsibility few things are without
[06:48:43] flaws in this world but the devotion and
[06:48:46] put on Testament to her commitment to
[06:48:49] continued progress bro she's a kid I
[06:48:51] enormous regret when I learned of the
[06:48:53] mistreatment she has endured over the
[06:48:55] past 500
[06:49:00] years true past
[06:49:06] 500 as a Survivor I shall fulfill
[06:49:09] nothing will stop me I shall fulfill my
[06:49:11] vow to judge all of the seven in turn
[06:49:13] even if the sky should fall and the
[06:49:15] ground give way as the recipient of the
[06:49:18] authority of Animo the god of Breeze and
[06:49:21] hope must also stand trial
[06:49:23] H he spends most of his time being a
[06:49:27] harmless
[06:49:29] drunkard true well even so that's my
[06:49:32] goat that's why dude that's why V's the
[06:49:36] best nothing will stop me
