[00:11:09] like later I don't know but I will be
[00:11:10] streaming my main account when she's out
[00:11:12] on na right now she's only out on Asia
[00:11:13] because they do this thing where Asia
[00:11:15] server gets characters earlier it is
[00:11:16] what it is it makes me regret not
[00:11:18] choosing the Asia server it is what it
[00:11:20] is uh so we are on jss account a VIP of
[00:11:24] the stream I've been on their account
[00:11:25] before uh for I think silver wolf for
[00:11:28] some [ __ ]
[00:11:30] their account is [ __ ] cracked the
[00:11:32] only difference is that the only like uh
[00:11:35] uh L is that they don't have in
[00:11:37] Lun but we're GNA play QQ so it's going
[00:11:41] to be relatable all right we're a QQ
[00:11:44] gamer uh yeah I was going to test her
[00:11:47] with Emer but we're going to use QQ and
[00:11:49] then on my main we'll use emiter or I
[00:11:51] have another someone else volunteered
[00:11:52] their a account that has in bitter um so
[00:11:55] we could swap at any point in the Stream
[00:11:57] but for now we're going to start with QQ
[00:11:58] like that's the well we also have
[00:12:00] jinguan uh but we'll talk about that
[00:12:03] later anyways QQ
[00:12:06] Gamba wait my sounds are
[00:12:14] muted wait a second I know where we are
[00:12:17] wait a second why are we here
[00:12:23] fireflies anyways we're going to pull
[00:12:25] for Sparkle uh and then we're going to
[00:12:27] play her and uh do all of that it's
[00:12:29] going to be
[00:12:33] great it's going to be
[00:12:37] great you ready
[00:12:40] chat uh I will say okay just to to to
[00:12:43] actually be the best the best Sparkle
[00:12:46] streamer by far for now here's
[00:12:48] everything you need to know very fast
[00:12:50] about Sparkle in 30 seconds and if
[00:12:51] you're not listening that's on you
[00:12:53] already okay if you play or slow you're
[00:12:54] a [ __ ] dumbass unless you're using
[00:12:55] sely outside of that you usually want to
[00:12:57] go 1601 160 60 speed not 161 16.1 try to
[00:13:01] get that if you can it's fine go as fast
[00:13:02] as possible even faster than that is
[00:13:03] good outside of that you use the generic
[00:13:05] support [ __ ] it doesn't really matter
[00:13:06] what you do broken kill but then your
[00:13:08] Relic set could be rainbow or it could
[00:13:10] be speed and then your L cone also could
[00:13:12] be literally anything but past and
[00:13:13] future is a really good freet to- playay
[00:13:14] one for other or her signature but for
[00:13:16] other lyes that'll be my guide uh E1
[00:13:19] over S1 but s1's pretty good too okay
[00:13:20] that's all ready why are shoes off I
[00:13:23] don't know she should probably put them
[00:13:24] back on it's what I mean it's still
[00:13:26] winter it's March but and almost March I
[00:13:29] would recommend putting them back on but
[00:13:30] you know I'm not going to tell her what
[00:13:31] to do uh Hana on the banner and QQ
[00:13:34] pretty POG uh
[00:13:47] sampo also Sparkle which is nice about
[00:13:51] her you can run your DPS on literally
[00:13:53] zero speed which is cool because my
[00:13:55] blade is the number one blade in the
[00:13:57] world when we get on a main with zero
[00:13:59] speed the only downside of my blade is
[00:14:00] he has no speed but his caul is like I'm
[00:14:04] telling you it's not just big it's also
[00:14:05] girthy and the thing with sparkle is she
[00:14:08] lets you go no speed so uh well Sparkle
[00:14:11] needs speed but your DPS doesn't so
[00:14:13] you'll see what do we play her now we're
[00:14:15] going to do a temple I don't know if
[00:14:17] this character has uh sorry this account

[00:20:07] Sparkle wait she only has one glove on I
[00:20:09] didn't even

[00:20:15] her she has a [ __ ] fish in a bowl
[00:20:17] what the
[00:20:23] hell all right
[00:20:27] cool
[00:20:32] also for the record uh we will be doing
[00:20:34] em Lin stuff later but for the M most of
[00:20:37] of this stream we will be using QQ and I
[00:20:40] have never I've leveled her on my main
[00:20:42] but I've never played her so there might
[00:20:43] be a little bit of skill issue but I
[00:20:44] like I understand how to player just
[00:20:46] understand that there's like a learning
[00:20:47] curve it's fine uh let's make a new team
[00:20:51] let's make a new
[00:20:53] team
[00:20:54] so we're going to
[00:20:57] do
[00:20:59] QQ where the [ __ ] is
[00:21:02] she am I blind yes or no press one if
[00:21:06] I'm stupid bro where is she not level 80
[00:21:09] oh she is okay uh and then we're playing
[00:21:12] Sparkle and then we're
[00:21:13] playing uh maybe Ron may I mean Ron May
[00:21:17] is just [ __ ] stupidly broken so
[00:21:21] sure oh you don't have runme okay we'll
[00:21:23] do paa then p is also broken it's fine
[00:21:26] uh my mouse just died wait let me plug
[00:21:27] it in
[00:21:34] okay he's right there wait what dude run
[00:21:39] me oh yo am I okay is he [ __ ] lost
[00:21:44] man is he okay congrats on winning the
[00:21:48] 50/50 may you get byou on your own
[00:21:51] account
[00:21:56] though I can't find her
[00:21:59] okay so something I want to say about
[00:22:01] Sparkle teams is that if your DPS isn't
[00:22:05] the most what is playing right now
[00:22:07] classical music for villains dude what
[00:22:09] all right I'm down [ __ ] it uh what I
[00:22:12] will say is that if your team is like
[00:22:15] very skill point hungry Sparkle helps
[00:22:16] but if they aren't then you can kind of
[00:22:19] get away with [ __ ] that you might not
[00:22:20] otherwise like for example if your team
[00:22:23] isn't super skill hungry but playing a
[00:22:25] Healer like Natasha or link still makes
[00:22:26] you want to like Minecraft yourself cuz
[00:22:28] you have to use skill points well now
[00:22:30] you can you know get away with it uh
[00:22:32] however Lua we'll probably fan though um
[00:22:37] I'll probably I mean I don't know we'll
[00:22:38] see oops I replaced the wrong character
[00:22:40] I knew you weren't in the repository
[00:22:42] I've been you for some time all right
[00:22:45] we'll
[00:22:48] see what does your phone look
[00:22:52] like kind of I mean all right there's
[00:22:54] like the little mask thing on top that's
[00:22:56] cool all right let's level
[00:22:59] her 8 million
[00:23:01] Mora I mean not Mora credits sorry gen
[00:23:06] build shall we shall
[00:23:13] we brain rot dude the more games I play
[00:23:17] the more synonyms of like gold or coins
[00:23:19] do I have to learn it's different in
[00:23:21] every game like there should be a law
[00:23:24] okay I believe there should be like a
[00:23:26] government that oversees every game in
[00:23:28] the world like like like a like a over
[00:23:30] like every country does a coalition to
[00:23:32] call like currencies the same thing in
[00:23:35] every game like that should be like a a
[00:23:36] world law not like a state like a like a
[00:23:39] like a it's like worldwide all like XP
[00:23:41] books have to be called the
[00:23:44] same and then like you have to battle
[00:23:46] between constellation and idolon and
[00:23:48] then that's what you call it in every
[00:23:49] game Let's push the envelope
[00:23:55] further it's either pyro or fire and
[00:23:58] everyone else goes to
[00:24:04] jail all right level 80 Sparkle that was
[00:24:07] fast fun surely it'll be as fast on my
[00:24:10] main right let's claim the PS wee pull
[00:24:13] we
[00:24:15] pull wee
[00:24:20] pull yeah uh yep I didn't even look at
[00:24:23] what lons we have I guess we'll use bras
[00:24:25] it's really good um dance dance dance
[00:24:27] also crap but you're dance dance dance
[00:24:28] oh you do have a leveled one I [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:24:30] that likeon though past and future is
[00:24:32] also cracked however I'm going to use
[00:24:33] bras
[00:24:35] because I feel like in this game people
[00:24:37] assume you have S1 more so than in genin
[00:24:39] so I'm just going to use bras cuz I
[00:24:41] don't have
[00:24:42] S1 okay
[00:24:45] traces give me a
[00:24:48] second
[00:24:50] uh wonder do
[00:24:53] that Misha where are you Misha where are
[00:24:57] you oh no that's not him where the [ __ ]
[00:24:59] is it there he
[00:25:06] is
[00:25:09] uh so I should have over 160 speed if I
[00:25:12] don't I promise you I will eat my my my
[00:25:16] my microphone that is a promise that is
[00:25:18] a
[00:25:19] guarantee okay cool
[00:25:22] um for those of you
[00:25:25] wondering actually no one is wondering
[00:25:28] it's just
[00:25:31] [Music]
[00:25:35] level holy [ __ ] you have 90 dude I
[00:25:39] thought I
[00:25:40] pre-formed I guess I didn't I have like
[00:25:43] [ __ ]
[00:25:45] 20 jeez my job hasn't paid me in months
[00:25:49] but happy one year nerd appreciate honey
[00:25:51] comie uh if your job doesn't pay you I
[00:25:54] wouldn't recommend using your money on
[00:25:56] my stream like I appreciate it but you
[00:25:59] can keep it don't worry don't
[00:26:04] worry rules are made to be broken rules
[00:26:08] are made to be
[00:26:24] broken all right we just click the fun
[00:26:26] button
[00:26:36] uh I kind of was just mindlessly
[00:26:39] clicking things if I'm being smart her
[00:26:40] Trace priority is skill and then alt and
[00:26:42] talent are the same so if this is nine
[00:26:44] then I look dumb if I don't level these
[00:26:45] two to nine so I'm going to level the
[00:26:47] other two to nine or I look like a
[00:26:48] [ __ ] dumbass
[00:26:51] um crit damage buff we'll take that HP
[00:26:54] I'm not going to die anyways but sure uh
[00:26:57] effect
[00:26:58] do I want to spend eight of not even my
[00:27:00] accounts things for that I could I
[00:27:08] could you
[00:27:10] [Music]
[00:27:13] look this how much was I yeah 24 I'm
[00:27:16] pretty sure I'm pretty sure this is the
[00:27:17] same as what I thought right 15 yes yes
[00:27:21] action Advance is 50% right where the
[00:27:24] [ __ ] does it say that yes it is okay
[00:27:26] cool yes
[00:27:28] okay 10%
[00:27:32] yeah okay one year will
[00:27:38] punch all right [ __ ] it rip your I'm
[00:27:40] sorry rip your mats I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:27:43] I need the grid damage I'm sorry okay
[00:27:46] um all right so this is our Sparkle
[00:27:49] right now 4,700 hp61 speed 167 crit
[00:27:53] damage
[00:27:56] um yeah
[00:28:03] all right uh you don't need to level
[00:28:04] Basics but I'm going to just in case um
[00:28:07] you don't need to basic on her but it's
[00:28:09] not the worst thing in the world so I'll
[00:28:10] get it to like three doesn't cost
[00:28:12] anything I'll get it to four doesn't
[00:28:14] really cost anything question mark it
[00:28:16] actually isn't bad cuz you get the same
[00:28:18] energy from basing than Skilling so
[00:28:20] sometimes if you play a sparkle bronia
[00:28:22] team which I will do today maybe uh you
[00:28:24] can I know you guys are going to act
[00:28:25] like your armchair experts and you never
[00:28:27] basic on her but you can in some teams
[00:28:29] so I'm going to level a little bit you
[00:28:31] actually can it it it makes you go from
[00:28:33] one skill point positive to seven skill
[00:28:35] like from seven in three turns to one
[00:28:39] but you don't usually do it but in some
[00:28:42] teams you do anyways well Okay the
[00:28:46] reason why it matters is cuz it's
[00:28:47] technically only like two teams but I
[00:28:50] should play those two teams so that I
[00:28:52] have footage for a video so we're going
[00:28:53] to play it uh we're going to go to the
[00:28:55] Parlor car we're going to do the memory
[00:28:56] chaos actually actually no we're let's
[00:28:58] let's
[00:29:00] um let me okay we're going to like try
[00:29:03] hard some stuff but first let me Auto
[00:29:05] Battle some something easy just so that
[00:29:07] I get like Auto Battle background
[00:29:10] footage before I have to start thinking
[00:29:12] uh just so that Allan isn't waiting on
[00:29:13] me for an hour
[00:29:16] um do you have something you want to
[00:29:18] spend your [ __ ] trailblaze power on
[00:29:20] or should I do something that doesn't
[00:29:21] cost any uncap we're not capped we're
[00:29:25] we're two away we got we got like 10
[00:29:29] minutes new relics Suk why do you need
[00:29:32] the new relics huh Sparkle doesn't use
[00:29:37] them why would you need this uh new set
[00:29:40] oh sorry why would you need this new
[00:29:46] set there's power in the mail I won't
[00:29:49] open their mail they can claim
[00:29:55] it wait actually for who I don't know
[00:30:00] learn how to play QQ first dude it's not
[00:30:04] hard you just press your [ __ ] skill
[00:30:06] and you enhance basic ooh
[00:30:11] fish that was a lot of damage and
[00:30:17] victory we we'll do manual gameplay just
[00:30:19] I need like one Autobot clear so that
[00:30:21] Allan isn't starving editing the guide
[00:30:23] cuz while I stream he's editing the
[00:30:24] guide so I don't want it like I don't
[00:30:26] want him to have no footage cuz I don't
[00:30:27] have footage so we need like one or two
[00:30:29] Auto clears and then we can
[00:30:35] play can you find the answer
[00:30:39] anyways gotta
[00:30:46] Cipher all will be swept away by the
[00:30:54] wind what's qq's lyone uh we're on the
[00:30:57] one with jingu on it I think it's jinu's
[00:30:59] likeon yeah I think we have J
[00:31:04] zon what up Safir happy birthday can we
[00:31:07] get a burp in the
[00:31:09] chat for our uh uh graphic designer that
[00:31:14] apparently dude okay
[00:31:16] yo okay yo no disrespect cuz I genuinely
[00:31:21] don't care like listen I actually don't
[00:31:24] care but like bro
[00:31:28] wait one
[00:31:29] sec one sec
[00:31:34] yo uh let me fill this
[00:31:36] up chat does this not one second does
[00:31:39] this not remind you of that one like
[00:31:42] genin content creator that you sometimes
[00:31:44] watch for
[00:31:46] builds where is this
[00:31:54] uh
[00:31:56] chat
[00:31:59] is this not like oh good I don't I
[00:32:02] actually don't care but like is that not
[00:32:04] like does that not look
[00:32:07] like oh good I must be
[00:32:10] tripping all right let me
[00:32:12] continue it's fine it's it's fine but
[00:32:16] like will you find the
[00:32:19] [Music]
[00:32:21] answer dude cuz I don't cover leaks so
[00:32:24] if you cover leaks why would you use a
[00:32:25] thumbnail that looks like mine then
[00:32:27] looks like I do that's not me I just
[00:32:28] wanted to ask why you look like sh War
[00:32:31] that's [ __ ] it's all good it's all
[00:32:32] good
[00:32:34] but together as one human
[00:32:41] creation Duality incoming again
[00:32:45] Duality
[00:32:54] and if Sparkle is the joker I'm Harley
[00:32:58] Quinn mods blow them
[00:33:04] upal is she okay without her lyone yes
[00:33:06] you don't need her lyone at all if
[00:33:08] anything I value E1 a little bit
[00:33:11] more come turn unless you're a base H
[00:33:14] andyer and want the Lyon on your
[00:33:17] account E2 yeah E2 is broken E2 is death
[00:33:19] shred 24% well def ignore it's pretty
[00:33:22] cracked E2 is better but I don't
[00:33:25] recommend dude if you're going to cuz if
[00:33:27] you get okay here's the thing if you get
[00:33:29] E2 you're probably getting S1 which
[00:33:30] means if if you ask E1 or or S1 and I
[00:33:33] say E2 then you're getting E2 and then
[00:33:35] you're getting
[00:33:36] S1 please and victory feeling
[00:33:49] spy all will be swept away by the
[00:33:55] wind
[00:33:58] can you find the
[00:34:01] [Music]
[00:34:03] answer between E2 and E1 S1 E2 the order
[00:34:06] of whale is E2 and then S1 cuz you have
[00:34:10] a good L cone like unless you're well
[00:34:11] the free to playay lones are good so you
[00:34:12] literally can't not have a good L cone
[00:34:14] unless you're like actively trying to
[00:34:16] not have a good lye you get me press
[00:34:17] 1299 4912 if you get me but I like
[00:34:20] having good lones on my account to use
[00:34:22] for other characters the only sort of
[00:34:25] weird thing though is that this L cone
[00:34:26] it might require testing to make sure it
[00:34:28] works how I think it works but the up
[00:34:30] time of it on characters that aren't
[00:34:31] Sparkle or haa doesn't look to be as
[00:34:34] good as I initially thought it would be
[00:34:36] cuz it's um you get okay when you enter
[00:34:40] combat you become dream you get a mask
[00:34:43] and then for three turns crit rate crit
[00:34:44] damage which is really good but then
[00:34:46] after that you need to spend skill
[00:34:48] points four times to get it again and
[00:34:50] let's say you're playing like BR yeah
[00:34:52] you could like have a [ __ ] ton of speed
[00:34:54] and then basic and skill but like let's
[00:34:55] say like even Ting Yun she'll do like
[00:34:57] skill and then basic basic uh and like
[00:35:00] so it'll take you a lot of turns to get
[00:35:03] the uh the alt
[00:35:04] again
[00:35:08] so it seems like to get yeah did I say
[00:35:11] alt to get mask
[00:35:14] whatever I think you generate Stacks
[00:35:16] while you have initial mask yes I assume
[00:35:19] you you can cuz if not it's it's it's
[00:35:21] pretty [ __ ] well not [ __ ] it's still
[00:35:22] good for Sparkle but I assume you can
[00:35:25] which is why I assume it's still a good
[00:35:27] L like I think it's a good lone
[00:35:30] however I don't think it's
[00:35:34] like cuz still though okay let's say
[00:35:36] you're playing BR and let's say you're
[00:35:37] not like [ __ ] 171 or 200 speed or
[00:35:39] whatever let's say you're playing normal
[00:35:43] BR you're not recovering like skill
[00:35:46] points like you're just spamming your
[00:35:47] skill so you wouldn't use on her okay
[00:35:49] what if you're playing like I don't want
[00:35:51] to use tting Yun as an example what if
[00:35:52] you're playing
[00:35:55] like yeah I don't know I mean I mean I
[00:36:01] guess just crit value I mean it's a ton
[00:36:03] yeah it's good for haa it's absolutely
[00:36:04] good for H I'm trying to think of like
[00:36:06] bad examples that would still work I
[00:36:09] think it's fine on tting Yun cuz you
[00:36:10] would well tingyun kind of wants mesh
[00:36:12] and COA but yukong I'm going be honest I
[00:36:17] deleted yukong for my memory so maybe uh
[00:36:21] yeah I mean I think it's good I just I I
[00:36:23] think it's not as valuable as I used to
[00:36:25] think it was more valuable than E2 E1
[00:36:27] but now I don't but it's not bad like I
[00:36:29] think it's pretty
[00:36:32] good
[00:36:35] anyways whoa she
[00:36:38] [ __ ]
[00:36:47] what why did she
[00:36:49] kick what does there EO well I know what
[00:36:51] the technique does but

[00:42:44] rope is there another one on another set

[00:45:24] think we are uh wrong button sorry
[00:45:27] yes and she's low as [ __ ]
[00:45:30] speed we should go Sparkle and then QQ
[00:45:34] automatically goes every time we
[00:45:37] go and then in first cycle and second
[00:45:40] cycle we're going to go twice so I'm
[00:45:42] just going to I'm just going to base it
[00:45:44] cuz it doesn't
[00:45:45] matter just join divination and
[00:45:50] awaken and we go again the
[00:45:54] cycle
[00:46:00] boom and then next cycle will also go
[00:46:07] twice I'm just going to use this I don't
[00:46:10] know I'm afraid of
[00:46:12] dying yeah we go here and then we should
[00:46:14] be going again so we'll do
[00:46:17] this and now boom [ __ ] it Al
[00:46:22] Gamba and now we go again
[00:46:33] go and
[00:46:35] yang I see yin and
[00:46:38] yang and then here we do that you find
[00:46:41] the answer although we already have
[00:46:42] seven skill points but don't talk to
[00:46:44] me and then yeah all right
[00:46:49] cool come on my turn look at the draw
[00:46:54] what happens if I all now just does my
[00:46:56] next attack have good matching [ __ ] cuz
[00:46:58] of that or does it not count oh wait no
[00:47:01] did I just waste it did that just
[00:47:09] wasted yeah it's wasted okay don't Ty
[00:47:12] pepega this isn't a real run we're just
[00:47:16] testing oh wait oh no that was the
[00:47:19] followup
[00:47:21] yeah wait was it wait wait let me read
[00:47:24] again dude it's my first time playing
[00:47:26] her stop getting mad at
[00:47:31] me
[00:47:36] yeah okay yeah yeah
[00:47:39] yeah God maker I didn't make a QQ guide
[00:47:42] so not true
[00:47:50] actually yeah yeah it's this it's this
[00:47:52] the followup attack okay makes sense but
[00:47:54] I just wasted the J tiles right cuz this
[00:47:56] thing gives me four of the same suit but
[00:47:57] I already had four of the same suit so
[00:47:59] you alt before
[00:48:03] Skilling
[00:48:05] no do or do you do it like blade blade
[00:48:07] does skill and then alt and then basic
[00:48:09] read the skill I
[00:48:16] did you four of a kind and
[00:48:24] ALT
[00:48:26] all right I'm
[00:48:36] down wait Q randomly draws one of three
[00:48:38] yes four hidden
[00:48:44] yes oh cuz you get damage increase
[00:48:46] that's
[00:48:48] why okay but you do lose out on that
[00:48:51] right like it Buffs your Al a lot so
[00:48:53] it's worth it but you do lose out on the
[00:48:54] tiles so it's not like you lose out on
[00:48:57] like skill points effectively but it
[00:49:00] gives you more damage so it's worth it
[00:49:04] right obviously with sparkle your skill
[00:49:06] points are fine
[00:49:09] but okay cool I get it all right we're
[00:49:17] good can't wait to [ __ ] up like 50 times
[00:49:21] okay uh before we actually do hard
[00:49:23] content which we will do I promise let
[00:49:24] me send what I have now to Allen so he
[00:49:26] doesn't have no footage
[00:49:28] uh action
[00:49:36] order what is
[00:49:41] this one
[00:49:46] second it's not rocket science bro I had
[00:49:50] to it's my first time playing
[00:49:54] her
[00:50:05] you missed our oneyear anniversary match
[00:50:08] #
[00:50:10] parasocial hash
[00:50:13] parasocial all right I'm uploading this
[00:50:15] to the
[00:50:17] drive okay
[00:50:20] pogers all right chilling okay um think
[00:50:25] need to level alt yeah I but I didn't
[00:50:28] want to like do it on your account I
[00:50:30] literally I checked your sparkle has a
[00:50:32] sorry your C has a [ __ ] level six
[00:50:38] alt well level three technically or four
[00:50:41] sorry
[00:50:42] technically
[00:50:51] but okay level Eight's good enough
[00:50:54] right
[00:50:59] he good
[00:51:01] enough do you want to enter do you want
[00:51:04] to enter the Forgotten Hall all right
[00:51:06] let's do it uh I'm going to be honest I
[00:51:08] think the meme is going to [ __ ] us I'm
[00:51:10] just being honest um we'll try it we
[00:51:14] will try it but I think we're going to
[00:51:15] get [ __ ]
[00:51:18] um we can also beat Sam I'm pretty
[00:51:23] sure um
[00:51:26] we could do 11 and
[00:51:28] 12 we could also do this
[00:51:32] one
[00:51:34] but
[00:51:36] anyways yeah we'll do 11 and 12 we'll
[00:51:38] start with 11 go 12 after uh okay we're
[00:51:42] going to do you use Sparkle and Bron
[00:51:44] with QQ you can also save Al to get
[00:51:47] extra enhanced Basics when you run out
[00:51:49] of skill points so all together
[00:51:52] yes the thing with sparkle bronia though
[00:51:55] is I assume you weave in Basics like you
[00:51:57] either have a really fast BR or you can
[00:51:59] like basic on Sparkle once but yes it's
[00:52:02] probably worth it to Al to get I assume
[00:52:04] that's
[00:52:07] true what if you do chat what if you do
[00:52:09] wait a second am okay be honest if I'm
[00:52:12] cooking or not what if you do Sparkle AA
[00:52:15] and you never run out okay hear me out
[00:52:17] you do QQ in Bor Lune and then [ __ ] your
[00:52:20] healer you do Sparkle
[00:52:24] haa okay
[00:52:27] where's
[00:52:29] uh
[00:52:31] here
[00:52:36] Sparkle kind of want a silver
[00:52:38] wolf actually
[00:52:40] no I think we Ron May silver in AOE is a
[00:52:44] k w it's definitely a Ron May angle and
[00:52:47] then
[00:52:48] fan and then the first half we play
[00:52:50] doesn't really matter let's say blade
[00:52:52] maybe actually we could do this this is
[00:52:53] probably the best team no Ron May is
[00:52:55] kind of sad
[00:53:01] but this account does not been no I
[00:53:04] literally dm'd him I dm' jss I said yo
[00:53:07] if I PayPal you $100 right now can you
[00:53:09] get emiter before the banner leaves and
[00:53:11] he said I have no mats then I'm like
[00:53:14] just use the whale shop he said I
[00:53:15] already bought out the whale
[00:53:18] shop
[00:53:20] oh it's
[00:53:24] fine
[00:53:27] all good uh so this is these are pretty
[00:53:29] good teams um Ron May would probably be
[00:53:31] better first half but this is
[00:53:38] fine
[00:53:40] oh or should I do Lua will I get chat do
[00:53:43] you think I'll die if I go Lua surely I
[00:53:45] won't die right surely Lua is my goat

[01:02:54] thought this was a
[01:03:00] bimer
[01:03:06] um so this is it even worth Skilling
[01:03:09] here let me read what this
[01:03:10] does unremovable all attacks consume HP
[01:03:13] increase speed wait no no it's a debuff
[01:03:15] it's not a buff
[01:03:17] uh one consuming sko the attacking Ally
[01:03:21] loses HP and additional additionally
[01:03:23] deals amount of fire
[01:03:26] damage
[01:03:28] okay waiting means
[01:03:31] change we fine all will be swept away by
[01:03:34] the wind aboba for
[01:03:47] Lune does it matter if I use a skill
[01:03:49] point here wait I want to see what

[01:03:56] T
[01:03:58] execution
[01:04:00] underway okay who

[01:04:27] some value I suppose I also don't need
[01:04:29] the skill
[01:04:30] here dude I have infinite [ __ ] skill
[01:04:36] points I literally have infinite skill
[01:04:40] points Implement
[01:04:43] implementation I'll go every pedal H
[01:04:46] will be swept away by the
[01:04:52] wind strike
[01:04:58] wait that's so
[01:04:59] funny am I
[01:05:06] dead oh [ __ ] she's
[01:05:09] dead Okay that was funny though that was
[01:05:12] actually fine that was actually funny
[01:05:14] dude dude it is what it
[01:05:16] is okay
[01:05:18] cool etal we're actually fine though we
[01:05:21] still clear
[01:05:22] this see wait actually maybe
[01:05:25] not
[01:05:28] feel can you find the answer no we
[01:05:32] actually clear this
[01:05:38] still okay Ron's
[01:05:41] Dead goodbye R okay
[01:05:44] anyway okay okay okay Point learned
[01:05:48] maybe we don't QQ here understand
[01:05:51] understood it's fine okay 12 will be
[01:05:53] easier though
[01:05:54] uh I think the same I think the team was
[01:05:56] good I think it's fine uh we don't need
[01:05:59] like we have too many skill points
[01:06:00] though so Fan's probably better or like
[01:06:03] maybe H for energy cuz our QQ was
[01:06:08] like maybe
[01:06:10] maybe maybe we do that uh I mean no I
[01:06:14] actually don't want to die I think F
[01:06:16] will help with tankiness
[01:06:21] uh the only thing is I wonder if we run
[01:06:23] a support that like like we could do
[01:06:25] silver wolf cuz we can actually use our
[01:06:27] skill like Ron is like skill point
[01:06:29] positive and we don't really need
[01:06:34] that but I kind of hate silver
[01:06:41] wolf hyper carry against death
[01:06:45] yeah what did she do to you she knows
[01:06:48] what she
[01:06:49] did I could play blade support I think
[01:06:52] he'll be fine
[01:06:55] [Music]
[01:06:56] dude unironically blade would
[01:07:01] work I'm not even coping by the way
[01:07:03] blade would actually
[01:07:12] work yeah he does help he would free uh
[01:07:15] QQ pretty
[01:07:16] fast but I think we're doing this team I
[01:07:20] think silverwolf helps break the the
[01:07:22] [ __ ] when when they trap you
[01:07:28] blade alone isn't that good in Breaking
[01:07:29] blade can attack like three times in a
[01:07:31] row you can attack and then passive and
[01:07:34] then
[01:07:40] ult why not just play QQ first side uh
[01:07:43] we could you could just implant Quantum
[01:07:46] here there's no reason like not to I
[01:07:48] just kind of want to fight death a meme
[01:07:49] I think it's
[01:07:50] funnier we could do
[01:07:52] both
[01:07:55] we'll do both we'll do literally both
[01:07:56] I'll clear once like this and then we'll
[01:07:57] swap it uh let me all right [ __ ] you pe
[01:08:01] I
[01:08:08] guess bro is on break
[01:08:13] effect what is the music playing
[01:08:21] on yo what are you doing
[01:08:27] uh I mean it doesn't really matter to be
[01:08:29] honest uh like I just go ER rope the
[01:08:32] rest doesn't really matter as long as

[01:09:49] um we going to do
[01:09:51] that and we're we're going to
[01:09:56] do that's enough that's enough I
[01:09:59] actually just caled it in my head that's
[01:10:00] enough yep all right we're
[01:10:04] chilling ready or not here we
[01:10:12] go better surrender while you have the
[01:10:15] chance nope wrong character feeling
[01:10:20] infallible
[01:10:22] 100% 100%
[01:10:30] for
[01:10:35] the I don't need to skill but like I
[01:10:38] have so many skill points I don't know
[01:10:39] if I ever run out of skill points I'll
[01:10:41] start thinking about what I'm doing but
[01:10:42] for now I'm just like mashing my e key
[01:10:44] and I'm not really getting punished for
[01:10:45] it cuz like as soon as I Al on Sparkle
[01:10:48] boom I'm back to seven so I don't even
[01:10:52] know okay I might as well Al I guess
[01:10:55] whatever I to take damage
[01:10:59] [Music]
[01:11:03] answer I'll oh wait actually when does
[01:11:05] cipher take down I
[01:11:08] forget
[01:11:11] uh wait does it take down at the start
[01:11:12] of her turn or at the start of their
[01:11:14] turn wa let me check
[01:11:21] too one but on QQ it's
[01:11:24] two okay so it's each of their turns
[01:11:25] okay that's fine it doesn't matter if I
[01:11:27] lose it on Sparkle is my point I just
[01:11:29] want to make cuz like Ron May it's like
[01:11:31] if you all before her turn starts you're
[01:11:33] griefing this combat needs
[01:11:37] optimizing this is double
[01:11:39] speed ha this is double
[01:11:45] speed oh maybe I should have hit the TV
[01:11:47] Dude okay so I'm not supposed to Al here
[01:11:50] no now he's angry I'm going to lose
[01:11:52] energy whatever
[01:11:58] no I got a
[01:12:00] prison I kind of want to implant here
[01:12:03] even though this breaks I'm going to
[01:12:05] implant no don't take oh he's
[01:12:11] dead I see through you I see through
[01:12:17] you okay so we spam
[01:12:21] skill I lost so many skill points

[01:12:36] chilling yo that wait that was actually
[01:12:39] a lot of damage wait QQ might be the

[01:12:52] way
[01:12:58] okay that that's why I'm going to say it
[01:13:00] that's why

[01:13:06] it's not 100% so the [ __ ] cycle went
[01:13:09] before my
[01:13:20] character I'm saving that clip
[01:13:26] let's play I'm tilted how much does she
[01:13:29] Advance 50% which typically doesn't
[01:13:31] matter like look let's say I skill here
[01:13:32] QQ goes next but like yeah whatever like
[01:13:37] it's usually 100 but like it's not 100
[01:13:39] but like usually it's the same but
[01:13:42] sometimes [ __ ] can go in
[01:13:47] between that was a

[01:21:11] believe in myself the only thing is I
[01:21:15] mean I guess we still play the same team
[01:21:17] uh there is a world where we bring blade
[01:21:19] for fun but I don't think we need it uh
[01:21:22] and Ron we'll put R man in the first
[01:21:23] half
[01:21:25] though cool
[01:21:30] it that wasn't bad proceed to lock skill
[01:21:33] points during the whole battle we only
[01:21:34] locked skill points once and it wasn't
[01:21:36] even our fault it was cuz the next wave
[01:21:38] of enemy spawned when we weren't ready
[01:21:39] so I actually don't even think I
[01:21:40] misplayed that was actually fine it was
[01:21:42] actually fine was it perfect maybe not
[01:21:45] but it wasn't

[01:24:54] cooler than meme
[01:24:58] but don't use QQ
[01:25:00] technique so that we spend more skill
[01:25:02] points is that actually a thing I guess
[01:25:05] this memory of chaos uh the moon Buffs
[01:25:07] you right based on how many skill points
[01:25:09] you spend that is so cringe why would
[01:25:13] you make I mean I guess that's cool Tech
[01:25:15] to know yeah that that makes sense
[01:25:17] surrender while you have the chance more

[01:33:47] of characters taller than you what do
[01:33:50] you mean by that more enem human
[01:33:56] creation time for
[01:33:59] a okay let's actually do this correctly
[01:34:01] so we do this then we spam our skill yes
[01:34:04] then we ult at
[01:34:06] thew I found it

[01:35:00] just in case I get [ __ ] and she has
[01:35:01] her
[01:35:04] alt hesitation only breeds

[01:35:35] thing pretty fast do this can you find
[01:35:38] the answer could be wrong though but I I

[01:35:47] speed I probably should have save my Al
[01:35:50] though

[01:41:36] assume Ron Ma just better there
[01:41:39] but
[01:41:43] anyways why are you guys aling him why
[01:41:45] are you guys aling him what did he do to
[01:41:47] you do you have him geared let's see oh
[01:41:50] okay okay okay okay speed get the [ __ ]
[01:41:55] out of my sight speed
[01:41:58] boots speed rope get the [ __ ] out of my
[01:42:03] sight all right sorry we're ying your
[01:42:07] topaz um do you have attack boots ah you
[01:42:12] don't this guy only locks speed or I
[01:42:16] guess defense too only locks speed I
[01:42:18] mean kind of Base wait this the wrong
[01:42:19] set what am I doing ew okay CU I saw
[01:42:21] them on him that's why my bad I don't
[01:42:23] know why I clicked on that oh
[01:42:29] oh okay I mean this is still a little
[01:42:31] crit rate heavy but it is what it
[01:42:34] is
[01:42:36] um we can take his
[01:42:40] light oh this gives crit damage I didn't
[01:42:42] even know
[01:42:45] that okay 101 speed clearly you
[01:42:49] [ __ ] don't know know what
[01:42:50] Sparkle does because the more speed you
[01:42:53] invest in jingu the worse he is with
[01:42:55] sparkle true it's not actually worse but
[01:42:56] it's just wasted stats why would you go
[01:42:58] speed doesn't [ __ ] matter stop it get
[01:43:00] some help unless you're zero cycling
[01:43:02] then you can go 134 but if you're doing
[01:43:04] that you're a I I'm sorry but if you're
[01:43:05] building your sparkle 134 and your DPS
[01:43:07] 135 you're weird I'm sorry it is what it
[01:43:10] is you can do that there's nothing wrong
[01:43:11] with being weird just know that you're
[01:43:13] weird there's nothing wrong with
[01:43:16] that it's okay to be weird but know that
[01:43:19] you are weird that's that's just
[01:43:20] recognize it it's fine should i t you or
[01:43:23] Ron may I feel like Ron is just like the
[01:43:25] best character in the
[01:43:39] game just don't speed tune anganga DPS
[01:43:43] Abba well that's the thing with sparkle
[01:43:45] you kind of don't have to all you do is
[01:43:47] you get her high speed and then you
[01:43:49] remove speed from your DPS and you're
[01:43:51] literally Bing chilling it does not
[01:43:53] matter you don't have to think more than

[01:50:35] I should upad this is double
[01:50:40] speed can you find the
[01:50:43] answer is Zio a whale no no he is not no
[01:50:48] he is not no he is
[01:50:51] not no he is
[01:50:54] not
[01:50:55] Victory no he is
[01:51:06] not human
[01:51:11] creation how good is Sparkles likeon
[01:51:14] it's good it's a lot of crit value to
[01:51:15] your team and crit damage to her so it's
[01:51:17] just good it's just a little less
[01:51:20] flexible to other supports than I
[01:51:21] thought outside of ha but overall it's a
[01:51:23] pretty good lone especially for her uh I
[01:51:26] would pick E1 though
[01:51:35] personally this is double speed who's
[01:51:37] your
[01:51:39] wife is Sparkle a musle no but you're
[01:51:41] going to get click baited into thinking
[01:51:42] she is
[01:51:44] probably she's really good come
[01:51:47] on gotcha mon turn
[01:51:59] am I dead dude I'm like at the edge of
[01:52:00] my
[01:52:02] seat please
[01:52:05] and
[01:52:07] victory as one human creation is she way
[01:52:13] better than
[01:52:15] braon
[01:52:17] aam after all these years
[01:52:35] is four more months until I've
[01:52:38] officially wasted away two years
[01:52:40] Watching You
[01:52:42] songs no matter feeling
[01:52:45] scky can you find the
[01:52:48] answer
[01:52:53] yeah in some teams she's like way better
[01:52:55] but the thing
[01:52:56] is I feel like the amount of people that
[01:53:00] just play imiter or like QQ when it like
[01:53:03] actually really matters isn't like as
[01:53:06] high however like as as you know people
[01:53:08] make it out to be however in any team
[01:53:11] ever she's good except like dot like you
[01:53:13] don't really want to buff you're like
[01:53:14] cuz she gives like crit damage
[01:53:18] um like she's really strong but the
[01:53:21] teams that
[01:53:39] [Music]
[01:53:44] yeah uh should I level any of I mean I
[01:53:47] haven't been dying I don't think it's
[01:53:48] worth it
[01:54:16] we're pogged is Dan that's good yeah
[01:54:18] that's s is good
[01:54:28] she good with blade uh not needed I
[01:54:30] think what the [ __ ] where'd she go I
[01:54:33] think she's good with blade if you play
[01:54:34] bronia too
[01:54:45] now like if you're doing like if you can
[01:54:48] you like blade on his own doesn't really
[01:54:49] care about skill points but if you're
[01:54:50] doing blade plus someone that uses skill
[01:54:52] points then it can
[01:54:55] work I mean we can try it I haven't
[01:54:58] really I just don't feel like speed
[01:55:00] tuning bronia
[01:55:06] Sparkle
[01:55:08] but
[01:55:10] yeah do you want to enter the
[01:55:18] forgot
[01:55:21] minus 8 months
[01:55:23] s like realistically you do Sparkle and
[01:55:27] braid gets uh blade gets brought up then
[01:55:30] BR then blade gets brought up again but
[01:55:32] the problem is you also are going to
[01:55:34] have to basic attack at some point or
[01:55:36] you don't have enough skill points right
[01:55:38] cuz Sparkle would be plus one after
[01:55:40] three turns cuz minus three then plus
[01:55:42] four bronia would be straight up minus
[01:55:44] three and then blade doesn't generate
[01:55:45] anything and then your healer has to
[01:55:47] generate so it' be like minus three plus
[01:55:50] one blade just uses one and then doesn't
[01:55:53] use anymore and then I mean yeah so
[01:55:56] you'd probably want Bron to be super
[01:55:58] fast I mean actually it's probably
[01:56:07] fine cuz Bron and blade and Lua offset
[01:56:10] each other and then Sparkle plus one
[01:56:12] blade is minus
[01:56:14] one so this is even but you can't heal
[01:56:17] you literally can't heal wait that's
[01:56:19] actually interesting I'm not going to
[01:56:20] try it that that should
[01:56:24] yeah how
[01:56:26] yeah yeah let's try it [ __ ]
[01:56:32] it so what is it
[01:56:36] it's uh Although our I assume they
[01:56:40] should both be on like like 161
[01:56:48] 160
[01:56:53] Sparkle blade bronia blade and then
[01:56:56] again Sparkle blade bronia blade but lra
[01:56:59] has to be [ __ ] fast as
[01:57:01] [ __ ] as
[01:57:08] well all this just for one
[01:57:13] clear give laa m o you are a smart
[01:57:16] cookie you're a smart cookie
[01:57:20] what the [ __ ] does he even oh there it
[01:57:22] is wait it's level one though bro n [ __ ]
[01:57:25] that never mind I for n no no no no
[01:57:27] we're
[01:57:30] chilling we're chilling we'll just it's
[01:57:32] fine we'll be okay I do agree though
[01:57:35] that's actually a good idea but we'll
[01:57:37] just stack speed it'll be fine win
[01:57:40] set no no it's fine I don't even think
[01:57:42] this guy has a wi
[01:57:45] set all good uh let me just do random
[01:57:48] speed make sure sure this works uh I I'm
[01:57:51] just going to filter by
[01:58:01] [Music]
[01:58:02] speed wait how the Oh that's
[01:58:08] okay
[01:58:18] eight
[01:58:24] okay tting Yun you can hold that uh tun
[01:58:28] yeah don't mind if I
[01:58:36] do I literally only need like one more
[01:58:43] speed Chad do you think if I go
[01:58:45] multiplication we'll be fine surely

[02:11:24] matter this battle is
[02:11:27] unavoidable why does bronia go before
[02:11:34] blade is this some idolon [ __ ] or am I
[02:11:37] just not capable of
[02:11:39] of a decisive moment in the
[02:11:42] battle oh I guess cuz blad started
[02:11:44] before both of them oh yeah yeah that's
[02:11:46] why yeah cuz he's like faster wait how
[02:11:49] much speed does he have wait I guess it
[02:11:51] might have worn off cuz I didn't skill
[02:11:53] wait let me see is it after I skill that
[02:11:55] he gets the
[02:11:56] buff I don't know oh it's just an
[02:11:59] advanced forward right yeah that's why
[02:12:01] fa
[02:12:03] to too little
[02:12:06] resist yeah
[02:12:08] yeah okay well I'm pretty sure it works
[02:12:11] but I can't really show it right
[02:12:16] now but like fairly certain it works uh
[02:12:20] where's
[02:12:22] brono yeah I
[02:12:26] mean yeah so it's probably just that
[02:12:30] yeah yeah I think it's just

[02:26:35] chaos first is there another character
[02:26:37] we want to play that I haven't
[02:26:40] played other than in bitor obviously but
[02:26:44] can't do that right now uh I don't Rec
[02:26:46] recommend her with
[02:26:47] CFA I also don't recommend her with
[02:26:50] jinglu typically uh we did blade we did
[02:26:53] Jing Yuen we could do ratio topaz I
[02:26:56] don't think it'll cuz ratio kind of
[02:26:58] wants a debuffer but like you could have
[02:26:59] a buffer in the team too but it's like
[02:27:02] if I'm also running
[02:27:10] topaz QQ we we did QQ we could do it
[02:27:14] again
[02:27:15] though
[02:27:21] can you use seal we don't have inor or
[02:27:24] on this

[02:27:32] have to learn her though do I have her
[02:27:33] Level D

[02:31:06] killer is the genjin killer number one
[02:31:08] it's the genin
[02:31:14] killer time for a fun
[02:31:20] thought you said you prefer P than
[02:31:21] silver wolf no no no don't make this
[02:31:23] seem like a like a biased opinion thing
[02:31:25] I'm not just saying I prefer pea to
[02:31:27] Silver Wolf I'm saying Pila is a better
[02:31:28] silver wolf I don't give a [ __ ] get mad
[02:31:31] at me you can get mad at me I'm just
[02:31:32] saying it how it
[02:31:36] is but there's some teams situations
[02:31:39] where you'd like silver wolf mono
[02:31:40] Quantum is a good uh situation right
[02:31:43] like a good team for
[02:31:45] silverwolf
[02:31:47] a quick divination a quick divination as
[02:31:50] one all things human creation true good
[02:31:59] take for
[02:32:03] a this is double
[02:32:10] speed to my
[02:32:12] heart I'll go easy
[02:32:15] this
[02:32:17] my
[02:32:17] turn look at the draw please and
[02:32:26] victory a I should have attacked the
[02:32:28] left one that was dumb of
[02:32:32] me but I don't think I'm going to lose
[02:32:35] uh much it's
[02:32:38] fine actually yeah that's fine let's I
[02:32:42] hate seeing
[02:32:45] enjy you find the answer T 69 months um
[02:32:50] take come well the thing with sparkle is
[02:32:56] like a quick divination yeah I just lost
[02:32:59] the cycle from not attacking the right
[02:33:00] enemy I feel like a dumbass it's
[02:33:07] fine the thing with sparkle is she's
[02:33:09] always good she doesn't need mono
[02:33:10] Quantum
[02:33:15] so
[02:33:17] and even a team like this uh like Fen
[02:33:21] gets the pass of being a good like she's
[02:33:23] broken as like a Healer shielder right
[02:33:26] but like you can use
[02:33:28] literally virtually A Healer or shielder
[02:33:31] of any element provided the enemies weak
[02:33:33] to it like let's say there's an ice
[02:33:34] healer out like jard or like something
[02:33:36] like that you can use them it doesn't
[02:33:37] have to be another quantum like you
[02:33:38] don't need four quantum here you just
[02:33:41] want to ensure that you can implant
[02:33:42] Quantum what if the enem is not Quantum
[02:33:44] weak here here the deer is is
[02:33:48] but or like example let's say this is
[02:33:52] cely well cely might not be the best
[02:33:54] example but if you're playing let's say
[02:33:56] you're playing like Quantum 1 Quantum 2
[02:33:59] and your DPS isn't Quantum no how do I
[02:34:02] explain
[02:34:05] this you have 10 seconds you dude chill
[02:34:09] what have 10
[02:34:11] seconds can you find the
[02:34:15] answer
[02:34:16] all things human

[02:38:26] right
[02:38:37] now oh wait what where did this come
[02:38:43] from [ __ ]
[02:38:51] cuz like that's zero that's

[02:39:46] [ __ ] up wait wait wait wait I got
[02:39:51] it okay cuz here's the
[02:39:59] thing oh I
[02:40:03] see I see what this means okay I'm gonna
[02:40:06] have to figure out how to [ __ ] show
[02:40:07] this cuz this means you get so your
[02:40:11] second action happens in the first cycle
[02:40:14] but then you lose it for the second
[02:40:15] cycle so you have one action here and
[02:40:17] you have one action here and you have
[02:40:18] one action here and you have one
[02:40:22] uh wait no here you have
[02:40:25] two and then seven would be like
[02:40:28] there we can't see yes you can oh you
[02:40:32] not see the the black on
[02:40:38] red how do I explain this
[02:40:41] though I mean it's fine I can add text
[02:40:45] cuz here here this is also this is one
[02:40:48] cycle I mean sorry one action two action
[02:40:50] then here you get one action two action
[02:40:53] and then here you get one
[02:40:59] action and then here it's one two here
[02:41:03] it's one two here it's one
[02:41:08] two this looks like
[02:41:14] caul
[02:41:18] write the numbers for each cycle yeah I
[02:41:20] probably
[02:41:21] should I dm'd
[02:41:25] you maybe add a solid
[02:41:38] line yeah I mean it works I just need to
[02:41:41] like figure out if it's worth the brain
[02:41:43] power to explain this
[02:41:50] yes so yes so 160 speed what it does is
[02:41:53] you get two actions first cycle of
[02:41:56] memory chaos and then another two
[02:41:58] actions the second
[02:41:59] cycle and then
[02:42:14] one
[02:42:30] does they don't have more than 160 speed

[03:30:09] whatever emor
[03:30:13] uh
[03:30:17] Sparky
[03:30:20] Ron
[03:30:32] loo isn't there imaginary res yeah but
[03:30:34] it's only one enemy
[03:30:39] right but you're right probably just do
[03:30:41] second
[03:30:44] half how do we even clear first half
[03:30:52] then I guess [ __ ]
[03:30:58] claraa kfka we don't have
[03:31:06] kfka how the [ __ ] do you play
[03:31:09] claraa this CL
[03:31:30] has that
[03:31:32] works Clara plays on her
[03:31:39] own
[03:31:44] call it just cely I'm sure the C is
[03:31:46] strong
[03:31:47] enough we got like we could cely
[03:31:51] um oh there's no silver wolf all right
[03:31:53] we'll just first half it [ __ ]
[03:31:55] it I'm sure either jingly or cely would
[03:31:58] work though with like Ting Yun or BR
[03:32:01] like sely BR paila Fen
[03:32:08] probably but anyways we'll just for off
[03:32:11] only only one enemy is imaginary
[03:32:13] resistant
[03:32:15] so it's fine caution does not mean
[03:32:22] cowardice watch this sound rers let's wi

[04:05:32] like I maybe I should have but I don't
[04:05:35] know do I get to go immediately
[04:05:38] oh [ __ ] well still winnable technically
[04:05:42] probably not now I actually have to
[04:05:45] think
[04:05:50] [Music]
[04:05:52] um okay [ __ ] Ron she can
[04:05:55] go Ron can go you have sparkle can go
[04:05:59] too I
[04:06:01] think
[04:06:03] one 1091 I mean I guess maybe Lua is
[04:06:06] less important than Ron than uh Sparkle
[04:06:08] cuz Sparkle lets us go
[04:06:12] again but L has pretty good
[04:06:20] break their bu stay active yeah but
[04:06:22] Sparkle lets us go twice right even
[04:06:24] though the buff stays well the buff
[04:06:26] stays till our turn starts Ron May will
[04:06:35] stay definitely do this this is
[04:06:37] happening be swept away by the
[04:06:42] wind kind of want a l Al
[04:06:46] but can you find the answer
[04:06:51] lra the time of my life okay I'm going
[04:06:54] to say [ __ ] my energy and I'm going to
[04:06:56] do this for more damage this is usually
[04:06:59] a
[04:07:01] misplay but it is more alt
[04:07:05] damage oh but I lose how many skill
[04:07:07] points I mean no I
[04:07:10] don't conflict requires undivided
[04:07:13] Focus let me
[04:07:23] think because I need to keepy my ALT
[04:07:27] right uh I could also just alt and then
[04:07:29] I'll get another alt back right I'll get
[04:07:31] another
[04:07:34] alt yeah alt also helps with our Basics
[04:07:36] that's true yeah yeah no you're right
[04:07:38] there's no reason not to actually
[04:07:41] there's like literally no reason not to
[04:07:43] I don't think I L Al though
[04:07:49] etal that was a little
[04:07:54] corch do not
[04:07:57] fret Eternal yo mod find the guy that
[04:08:00] said saving skill points for hsr2 find
[04:08:03] them please my cycle no no
[04:08:09] oh okay but it it was literally just the
[04:08:11] first half's fault like we didn't even
[04:08:13] play that it was just the first
[04:08:15] half it was literally just the first
[04:08:19] half sense a
[04:08:24] storm awaken from World cleansing
[04:08:29] Dragon let can you find the
[04:08:33] [Music]
[04:08:35] answer it feeling

[04:08:48] clear I'm
[04:08:52] tilted 19 dude the first time
[04:08:57] I the
[04:08:59] time
[04:09:01] [Music]
[04:09:03] and I swear this is
[04:09:12] I'm going to assume this is 13 3.4 I
[04:09:15] could technically look it up on Ena but
[04:09:17] I don't really want to and I'm going to
[04:09:18] assume that's enough and I'm going to
[04:09:19] Auto Battle this and it's going to do
[04:09:21] better than sely because I want to be
[04:09:22] able to do something in the background

[04:15:27] um wait I didn't Al awaken D scales I
[04:15:31] don't know it was s before the game came

[04:15:37] like Koko helps with AOE for like
[04:15:39] farming even though she sucks and I was
[04:15:41] like dude I swear at some point it's
[04:15:43] going to be the opposite guess what the
[04:15:46] [ __ ] happened imagine playing hunt in

[04:17:13] Dragon I'm going to do a n two only
[04:17:16] because I don't think I need
[04:17:18] three

[04:17:24] and all will be swept away by the
[04:17:30] wind let's play can you find the
[04:17:34] answer and I swear
[04:17:37] where existence is I'll go e
[04:17:41] feeling the
[04:17:43] strength awak anyone else love it when
[04:17:46] your in B Lune is has no speed but
[04:17:49] effectively has 160 speed cuz your
[04:17:51] sparkle has 160 speed yeah me
[04:17:53] too this post was made by the fast
[04:17:56] Sparkle
[04:17:58] gang Eternal sleep the Dead
[04:18:05] return
[04:18:11] there's more to like every pedal all
[04:18:12] will be swept away by the
[04:18:17] wind let's can you find the
[04:18:26] answer
[04:18:29] break all
[04:18:33] right you chose minus four skill points
[04:18:36] wait why do you guys act like the
[04:18:38] purpose of Sparkle is skill point
[04:18:40] efficiency if you're doing you're just
[04:18:42] trying to Max your damage if you what
[04:18:44] are you talking what are you yapping
[04:18:46] about are you going to save your [ __ ]
[04:18:48] alt don't say I feel like I should have
[04:18:51] to add this in the guide don't save your
[04:18:53] alt because you might overcap one skill
[04:18:56] point it gives a ton of
[04:18:59] damage that's the point yeah if your
[04:19:01] team is like [ __ ] I don't even know
[04:19:04] what team would need that many like QQ
[04:19:06] and your unlucky like maybe maybe but
[04:19:09] like even with invetor it's like why
[04:19:11] would I like I I'm never like [ __ ] the
[04:19:13] only times I like [ __ ] I'm out of skill
[04:19:15] points or if the the the Moon [ __ ] me
[04:19:18] like if the like the blessing brings me
[04:19:20] up but like I don't know it's not worth
[04:19:25] me using emer's skill and ALT before
[04:19:28] Sparkle alting as yeah before Sparkle
[04:19:31] alting when I would lose out on 10 *
[04:19:34] three uh damage bonus right or attack is
[04:19:36] it damage bonus I'm Prett sure it's
[04:19:37] damage bonus
[04:19:38] yes cuz this Stacks three
[04:19:41] times and this yeah so instead of this
[04:19:44] being 6 * 3 it's 16 * 3 so there's no
[04:19:48] reason like not
[04:19:53] to anyways
[04:19:59] fck this guy's cracked this thing's S3
[04:20:02] what the
[04:20:05] [ __ ]
[04:20:07] play a mil only team okay you might have
[04:20:10] joined the wrong stream however look up
[04:20:13] Kafka Black Swan best team uh and three
[04:20:15] of the four characters will fit your
[04:20:21] criteria so you know who you're pulling
[04:20:29] for use I guess use Natasha as your
[04:20:32] [ __ ]
[04:20:35] healer
[04:20:45] D team
[04:20:50] when are there even are there Harmony
[04:20:53] like are there male Harmony
[04:20:57] characters wait a second I haven't even
[04:20:59] thought about this are

[04:21:04] wait there aren't even like debuffers
[04:21:05] it's just pea silver wol

[04:21:07] welt okay your wel is your [ __ ]
[04:21:11] Harmony so you're doing you're doing
[04:21:13] you're doing doctor ratio wealth this
[04:21:16] guy doesn't have wealth doctor ratio
[04:21:18] Pretend This Is wealth
[04:21:20] wealth uh
[04:21:23] Lua and
[04:21:28] someone aventurine
[04:21:35] Sask
[04:21:41] isn't event in preservation though
[04:21:43] didn't we see
[04:21:47] that so yeah probably wouldn't be on the
[04:21:50] same team as the ultra but I don't
[04:22:05] know
[04:22:14] let me claim your battle pass
[04:22:18] okay damn 45 mine's are like [ __ ] we
[04:22:21] don't talk about
[04:22:24] it hey
[04:22:31] himo all right uh well I got to get
[04:22:34] ready to upload my Sparkle guide uh
[04:22:36] sorry it's not out as early as I assume
[04:22:38] some others are but I have to record
[04:22:40] some footage so I'm going to go finish
[04:22:41] it it should be out today uh like within
[04:22:43] the day so for me I'm going to nap while
[04:22:45] it's being edited wake up upload it
[04:22:47] that's the goal uh the only things I'm
[04:22:50] going to have to review are like some
[04:22:51] speed tuning stuff I don't think it's
[04:22:52] much I think it's literally just go 160
[04:22:55] like go fast I think it's just the the
[04:22:56] whole section it's fine um
[04:22:59] afterwards yes I have to make a new Tik
[04:23:01] Tok account so whenever that happens
[04:23:03] I'll let you guys know you better follow
[04:23:06] Sparkle gu will come out acon I should
[04:23:08] be faster but we're not going to talk
[04:23:10] about acon yet uh is4 speed enough speed
[04:23:15] is good in general there's no like
[04:23:17] specific amount you need but getting 160
[04:23:20] lets you go twice in the first two
[04:23:22] memory of chaos Cycles so it's like a
[04:23:24] nice goal but even if you have a bit
[04:23:27] less it's fine or a bit more like it's
[04:23:30] fine just go as much speed and crit
[04:23:33] damage or what you're looking for kind
[04:23:35] of like kind of like brono but not
[04:23:37] exactly uh the thing with
[04:23:39] like
[04:23:46] yeah does speed not just make you fast
[04:23:49] yes it does but it also like there's
[04:23:51] certain break points certain specific
[04:23:53] speed numbers where for certain types of
[04:23:56] content notably memory of chaos you get
[04:23:57] to go twice per cycle or like for not
[04:24:00] every cycle but like for certain Cycles
[04:24:02] so it doesn't like speed in general long
[04:24:05] term will give you more turns so in
[04:24:07] general speed is good however certain
[04:24:10] speed break points give you like a lot
[04:24:14] more value if it helps you clear a cycle
[04:24:18] faster
[04:24:21] right oh she's
[04:24:24] gone were you shocked just now speed
[04:24:27] tuning is cringe yes I agree which is
[04:24:28] why I say just go 160 like that's very
[04:24:31] brain off 160 is your goal anything less
[04:24:34] is fine work your way there at some
[04:24:36] point point and then you're
[04:24:41] chilling is it a 161 no it's 16.1 but if
[04:24:45] you have 160 and it's not first of all
[04:24:48] you can check on
[04:24:49] Ana uh but I'm going to say 160 I'm not
[04:24:51] going to say 161 cuz I think that's
[04:24:52] cringe but you can check on Ana and also
[04:24:56] uh it shows the decimals and also if you
[04:24:59] personally have a 160 Sparkle but it
[04:25:02] doesn't go twice in the first two cycles
[04:25:04] meaning you're under 1601 you're 160
[04:25:06] exactly then you are owed Zio
[04:25:08] compensation and I will personally
[04:25:10] apologize to you but yes 161 to be safe
[04:25:14] it's
[04:25:15] 16.1 so
[04:25:23] yeah it's
[04:25:35] there
[04:25:41] dude I think Sparkle should be able to
[04:25:42] like 180 her neck like 360 it she should
[04:25:45] still follow us I think it would be lore
[04:25:47] accurate oh T you yeah
[04:25:53] she sorry uh
[04:25:57] chat sorry I'm sorry I apologize so it's
[04:26:03] okay had the time of
[04:26:07] why is the song suck in my head I don't
[04:26:08] even listen to
[04:26:11] it never felt this way
[04:26:14] before I swear this is
[04:26:18] [Music]
[04:26:26] true oh tun's fine it's not nothing
[04:26:30] wrong T's fine she's actually fine not
[04:26:33] even copium she's
[04:26:35] fine
[04:26:39] hello wel you're
[04:26:43] back thank you Mr
[04:26:47] Yang check the mail it's not my account
[04:26:49] I'll check on my mail on my
[04:27:04] account
[04:27:29] yeah ra sweet this time stare why you
[04:27:32] staring at
[04:27:34] me why you staring at
[04:27:41] me got black Dr Ra natas and BR as main
[04:27:44] team are they great uh together not I
[04:27:47] mean honestly no yes no I
[04:27:51] mean I think Black Swan can work as a
[04:27:55] copium Pila because she shreds defense
[04:27:58] like she's good in her own team but like
[04:27:59] unironically can copium pilo with Dr
[04:28:01] ratio it's not as bad as it sounds uh I
[04:28:05] don't know about the rest though like I
[04:28:06] would probably just put pea there and
[04:28:08] then uh use Black Swan in another team
[04:28:11] but like it could be
[04:28:13] fine the only problem is you have to use
[04:28:16] your skill like you have to use a skill
[04:28:17] point there your team doesn't sound very
[04:28:19] skill point efficient cuz you're running
[04:28:20] ratio plus Black Swan who in a ratio
[04:28:22] team wants the skill plus Natasha who
[04:28:25] needs to skill to heal plus BR unless
[04:28:27] you're like really high skill point bra
[04:28:29] it
[04:28:31] it it'll probably work but
[04:28:41] anyways thanks for watching chat we're
[04:28:44] going to end it here I'm going to stream
[04:28:46] again uh when I can I'm going to release
[04:28:48] the sparkle guide then I'll do another
[04:28:49] star rail stream with sparkle on my main
[04:28:51] account I don't know if it'll be today I
[04:28:52] don't know if it'll be tomorrow two days
[04:28:53] I don't know but I will do another one
[04:28:54] with sparkle and the guide should be out
[04:28:57] within 24
[04:28:58] hours that is all thank you uh yes as
[04:29:02] chat is suggesting we can raid someone
[04:29:04] we can raid Ariel for instance
[04:29:08] uh we'll raid them be nice thanks for
[04:29:11] watching chat I love you all not Paras
[04:29:13] socially stay tuned for the guide coming
[04:29:15] soon uh the thumbnail is already made
[04:29:18] dude okay I can complain about this now
[04:29:20] cuz the stream is ending I've seen so
[04:29:22] many people literally like yoink our
[04:29:24] exact thumbnail which is fine that now
[04:29:26] when I look at my thumbnail it looks
[04:29:28] like someone else's so it like [ __ ]
[04:29:29] with me and like now I we might change
[04:29:31] it I don't even know it literally like
[04:29:34] when I look at my own thumb nail now it
[04:29:36] doesn't even feel like mine it's [ __ ]
[04:29:38] it actually is [ __ ] my mental I don't
[04:29:40] know we might modify it a bit but then
[04:29:42] people are just going to Y that one I
[04:29:44] don't know it's fine it's fine but it's
[04:29:46] fine uh thanks for watching it's fine
[04:29:49] whatever I still think the Gen ones are
[04:29:51] very unique but like when I look at the
[04:29:53] the the star rail ones of ours I I feel
[04:29:55] like they're too similar
[04:29:58] now I don't care though like I'm not
[04:30:00] trying to start I don't give a [ __ ] like
[04:30:01] it's fine it's flattery but it's just
[04:30:03] like now I look at it I'm like this
[04:30:06] looked off so I might I might think
[04:30:08] about modifying it we'll see no big
[04:30:18] deal no it actually doesn't matter like
[04:30:20] it's just like now I like it just like
[04:30:22] [ __ ] with me
