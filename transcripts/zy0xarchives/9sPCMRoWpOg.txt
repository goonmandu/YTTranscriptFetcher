[00:09:00] he said he covered for me
[00:09:03] however this is your fault chat it's
[00:09:06] Jake's fault and my reputation as a a
[00:09:10] streamer as a person and also as a son
[00:09:13] of of of of of of of a father is
[00:09:18] ruined now with that in mind I we're
[00:09:21] going to do the Jean outfit archon Quest
[00:09:24] and I think I'm going to record a gene
[00:09:25] guide soon cuz she's really good with
[00:09:28] finina
[00:09:30] says the catboy
[00:09:34] made
[00:09:37] listen I was thinking I was like dude
[00:09:39] archon act three 5 hours four five hours
[00:09:43] the the the five five hours it's
[00:09:46] literally I I can't stream that long so
[00:09:48] what I'm going to do is act three I'm
[00:09:50] going to do off stream I already started
[00:09:51] it I saw AR Lino she sat on a chair I
[00:09:53] wish I was that chair I didn't say that
[00:09:55] I watched it it was pretty cool I liked
[00:09:57] it it was nice uh I'm not done act three
[00:09:59] though but I'm doing it then four and
[00:10:00] five we're going to stream okay the next
[00:10:02] two the new one the newest one we're
[00:10:03] going to stream it no spoilers it'll be
[00:10:05] this week Surly not copium surely I'll
[00:10:09] try um so yeah the only Quest we're
[00:10:11] doing off stream is uh act three a tea
[00:10:15] party most horny and then after that
[00:10:18] four five boom on
[00:10:21] stream anyways yeah everyone's saying
[00:10:23] it's really
[00:10:24] good
[00:10:27] um yeah so that's why I'm doing this one
[00:10:29] stream I'm paying attention though I I
[00:10:30] saw you know I was like reading it the
[00:10:32] the finina arino talk I was reading it
[00:10:34] so that I'm not like out of the
[00:10:36] loop but yeah so that's that I also want
[00:10:39] to do uid reviews we're also going to do
[00:10:40] a whale account review probably
[00:10:42] collabing with tenha maybe um and then
[00:10:46] we're going to do the cursed account
[00:10:48] review and I want to start playing My
[00:10:50] Free Play account not Co not no no we'll
[00:10:52] just do it I'm not going to say I'm
[00:10:53] going to do it I'm just going to do it
[00:10:55] the only reason I have been really busy
[00:10:57] is cuz for some reason they put the two
[00:10:59] new characters this patch
[00:11:01] so it's been busy for me uh also
[00:11:05] tomorrow I have to go to Toronto for
[00:11:07] like two days it's not going to be for
[00:11:09] long but I have to and then I'll be back
[00:11:11] home
[00:11:14] um with that in mind I'll show you why I
[00:11:16] had M Channel open uh with that in mind
[00:11:19] I
[00:11:20] released probably my longest complete
[00:11:23] guide ever 32 minutes 41 seconds I
[00:11:26] trimmed a lot I had to remove a part
[00:11:29] uh Allan worked really hard on it I
[00:11:31] worked really hard on it we got it out
[00:11:33] in time it was within the first 24
[00:11:37] hours and I think people liked it
[00:11:39] despite it being long so I hope you guys
[00:11:41] liked it yeah sh guide was longer but
[00:11:42] Shia is my my all Shia was sh so I hope
[00:11:46] you guys liked it I worked really hard
[00:11:48] on it check minute
[00:11:50] 3155 oh no what did I do did I swirl
[00:11:53] okay I think my coo missed the swirl
[00:11:56] here but like that's okay dude it
[00:11:58] happens
[00:12:00] no it's fine wait what's wrong wait what
[00:12:04] happened wait wait wait I was what
[00:12:06] happened oh yeah I wrote oops slau dude
[00:12:08] I literally wrote oops slau okay dude
[00:12:11] dude dude dude dude what is this Tom
[00:12:13] [ __ ] look at this look at this look
[00:12:15] at this clear it's not even
[00:12:21] bad okay bit rate moment all good it was
[00:12:24] literally good the only thing that
[00:12:25] happened is this [ __ ] decided to
[00:12:27] spawn something on my let so it canceled
[00:12:30] the charge that's literally not my fault
[00:12:31] if I had C1 you wouldn't even be typing
[00:12:33] like that was relatable cuz I'm c0 true
[00:12:36] L dou you didn't uh the only sort of
[00:12:39] mistake I did you didn't show Amber team
[00:12:42] I'm not
[00:12:43] showing the thing with
[00:12:45] finina is that the guide was already so
[00:12:48] [ __ ] long okay I was at the point so
[00:12:51] I was at the point where I recorded the
[00:12:53] Healer section best healers for her and
[00:12:55] then after it was over 30 minutes and I
[00:12:57] was like okay I have to find a way way
[00:12:58] to record every team without it being 17
[00:13:01] years long because the guy would just be
[00:13:03] that long if I talk about every team and
[00:13:05] she could be used in literally any
[00:13:08] [ __ ] team except like Linny but like
[00:13:11] even that someone D me hey Z can I use
[00:13:14] finina in a Linny monop
[00:13:16] pyro what does monop pyro mean if
[00:13:18] there's a hydro in anyways even then
[00:13:21] it's like sure but like yeah finina can
[00:13:23] be used like literally anywhere so what
[00:13:24] I did is I generalized it I said hey you
[00:13:26] can use her in like these type of teams
[00:13:27] and I talked about some Carri I showed
[00:13:30] instead of like show also Noel got way
[00:13:31] better by the way for Noel Ms in chat
[00:13:33] Noel got way better uh anyways fur drain
[00:13:37] my uh true but I I actually didn't hear
[00:13:40] the whole Dono so I didn't say true to
[00:13:42] that there's one part where I I I showed
[00:13:44] like I was like yeah you can play her
[00:13:45] with carries like rizzly YULA and Ryden
[00:13:47] and someone commented hey in the YULA
[00:13:49] rizzly Ryden team uh can I replace
[00:13:51] someone with a Healer I'm like that
[00:13:53] wasn't a team it was anyways doesn't
[00:13:55] matter um the only kind of mistake it's
[00:13:59] not a mistake I just said the wrong word
[00:14:00] was at 213 I said under instead of over
[00:14:03] obviously it meant the same thing under
[00:14:05] 50% HP I meant to say over that's the
[00:14:07] only thing the explanation was still
[00:14:08] good you know you know it is what it is
[00:14:09] but um 32 minutes by the way dude I went
[00:14:13] to bed I Woke Up This was number six on
[00:14:15] trending and I think I woke up past its
[00:14:17] peak so it's probably higher dude what
[00:14:20] the hell I opened my I opened the the TV
[00:14:23] upstairs my dad's TV and it was
[00:14:25] literally there in my dad's like like
[00:14:28] not recommended but like in like the
[00:14:29] trending category or like the gaming
[00:14:30] category but it wasn't even trending for
[00:14:32] gam just Global trending this has 56k
[00:14:35] views in how anyways thanks guys I
[00:14:37] appreciate it um I'm not a viewer
[00:14:39] account Andy but trending is insane so
[00:14:43] appreciate it so I'm happy three months
[00:14:47] brother thank you for the
[00:14:49] fun I was waiting for it yeah like
[00:14:52] here's the thing also I noticed a lot of
[00:14:55] people get their frea videos like the
[00:14:56] new character videos people get it out
[00:14:59] faster than me but it's like I try to
[00:15:01] make my guides I I can't if okay unless
[00:15:03] I half as a video which I'm not going to
[00:15:05] I can't get a 32-minute guide out faster
[00:15:07] there's just no way right this literally
[00:15:10] just impossible so it's like I tried to
[00:15:13] still do it as fast as I could the only
[00:15:15] way
[00:15:19] so okay not to be that guy who's like
[00:15:21] leaking stuff but like I'm just gonna
[00:15:23] say it I assume the only way other
[00:15:26] people okay unless okay
[00:15:29] unless videos are shorter than this
[00:15:31] which they almost always are the only
[00:15:33] way I could do this faster is if you
[00:15:35] make the video off of leaks that's the
[00:15:37] only way cuz it's like I don't know what
[00:15:39] finina does until I do and like at that
[00:15:43] point there's no way I can make a
[00:15:44] 32-minute guy so it's like maybe maybe
[00:15:46] hey maybe that's the [ __ ] play but I
[00:15:48] don't look at leaks so anyways um when
[00:15:51] are you going to shave when are you
[00:15:52] gonna get a you're right I need to but
[00:15:55] yeah um with that said I don't know I
[00:15:58] feel in chat are acting like it's a war
[00:16:00] everyone I love every content creator
[00:16:03] unless they're weird but like in general
[00:16:05] we're all friends and we're all cool
[00:16:06] it's not like a I like everyone it's
[00:16:08] chill I'm just saying I know I can't get
[00:16:11] it out the fastest sometimes but there's
[00:16:13] a reason for that that's
[00:16:14] all
[00:16:16] um that's literally all there's no like
[00:16:19] competition everyone's
[00:16:20] cool
[00:16:22] um but that's like the only thing is
[00:16:25] like like for example what I did with
[00:16:27] Nita I did a review like sometimes I
[00:16:29] think this is smart like with de I did a
[00:16:31] review and then I did a guide a bit
[00:16:32] later so the review was out instantly
[00:16:34] and then there's a guide a bit later so
[00:16:35] like that makes sense sometimes which I
[00:16:37] do sometimes I was debating doing it for
[00:16:40] finina but I also think having like the
[00:16:41] big guide out AAP a as fast as possible
[00:16:44] is uh what I like to do so that's why
[00:16:49] um
[00:16:52] yeah I don't think is better than S
[00:16:55] question mark it depends it always
[00:16:57] depends exclamation mark it depends I
[00:17:00] could go into detail on it but I don't
[00:17:03] want to because I covered it in my guide
[00:17:04] and then probably have it on a notepad
[00:17:06] somewhere but I made a clip out of it
[00:17:09] but I don't think it got like I don't
[00:17:10] know if it got clipped but I talked
[00:17:11] about it uh than mon but yeah that so
[00:17:14] that's that um I'm always like wondering
[00:17:17] should I make a faster video and then
[00:17:20] the guide out like review and then guide
[00:17:21] for certain characters maybe I did with
[00:17:23] the I don't think it's I don't know
[00:17:25] we'll see um the only reason I say that
[00:17:27] is cuz uh
[00:17:29] I know that some people just want
[00:17:31] whatever information is out as soon as
[00:17:33] possible but then that can spread that
[00:17:35] can make me it won't make misinformation
[00:17:37] but it might make me miss out on some
[00:17:39] things for example a lot of times I
[00:17:42] could have a guide out like ready as the
[00:17:44] server drops but once that
[00:17:48] happens oh like no one else had to got
[00:17:52] to play the character yet so there's a
[00:17:53] lot of like discoveries that aren't
[00:17:55] discovered until after the character has
[00:17:57] been played but you could argue okay
[00:17:59] just make another video later then and
[00:18:00] then you milk two videos but it's like I
[00:18:02] don't really want to do that whatever
[00:18:03] that's just the thing I'm glad you guys
[00:18:05] liked it it did really well anyways the
[00:18:06] only reason I haven't been streaming
[00:18:07] much is because I've been prepping for a
[00:18:08] lot of stuff uh among those Among
[00:18:12] Us by video is full is
[00:18:17] done it's done it's about to be uploaded
[00:18:19] by video the review and charlot video I
[00:18:22] fully recorded but for some reason I
[00:18:25] stalled in the video so I'm trying to
[00:18:26] fix that but those two are done uh after
[00:18:29] it'll probably be Gan guide maybe Shang
[00:18:30] Ling maybe duuke we'll see uh I was GNA
[00:18:33] do duuke but then I couldn't even I
[00:18:34] [ __ ] died to the Thunderbird and I
[00:18:36] got pissed so [ __ ] duuke uh he can die
[00:18:38] in a fire but uh we might uh make it
[00:18:40] we'll see who knows probably not thee
[00:18:42] can like probably five point patch 5.0
[00:18:44] we'll make it to the good anyways yeah
[00:18:46] so that's what's going to happen
[00:18:48] um Noel actually got a lot better too is
[00:18:52] the golden troop set viable for Hut
[00:18:55] sorry to interrupt did you saw the
[00:18:57] massive amount of HSR Dev news about
[00:19:00] yeah I'm going to look for it I'm going
[00:19:01] to look at that off I have it open I
[00:19:03] didn't look at it yet Co this a tier
[00:19:04] three for a year jeez minus a year but
[00:19:08] anyways so that's that
[00:19:10] um wow uh is there anything else I want
[00:19:14] talk about oh yeah uh we're traling I
[00:19:17] opened editor apps I didn't look through
[00:19:19] them yet I'm sorry if you applied I
[00:19:20] didn't respond I'm busy but I'm going to
[00:19:22] tral one to two more editors currently
[00:19:24] we have like three to four well like two
[00:19:26] well marai mari's I don't count him but
[00:19:28] he's the second Channel editor who's a
[00:19:29] gigachad but we also have two three main

[00:23:38] addition forgotten Hall Auto Clear
[00:23:39] function will be introduced after 1.6
[00:23:41] update Trail bues can quickly clear the
[00:23:43] Forgotten Hall without needing to
[00:23:44] rechallenge previous stages based on the
[00:23:46] highest Three Star level from the P
[00:23:48] chaos trilers can directly challenge the
[00:23:51] highest Three Star level from past
[00:23:52] periods upon achieving a three star
[00:23:54] Victory they'll achieve all the rewards
[00:23:55] from proing stages the highest level
[00:23:57] allowed is stage seven damn so you start
[00:24:00] at [ __ ] Abyss 7 then you do memory
[00:24:02] cast 7 8 9 10 11 12 Dam that's [ __ ]
[00:24:07] insane I used to yeah I used to
[00:24:08] literally just it's so [ __ ] click
[00:24:10] intensive to Auto Battle it like you
[00:24:11] have to do like yeah yeah it take a
[00:24:14] while that's that's sick yo s this is 35
[00:24:17] months I'm I'm
[00:24:19] back hello z x
[00:24:24] hi why does hoyo treat genin so badly
[00:24:26] listen here
[00:24:28] I love gen
[00:24:33] impact no I mean I to be
[00:24:38] fair okay here's here's my take I think
[00:24:42] be I
[00:24:48] think I think they know what they're
[00:24:50] doing and they're trying to divide their
[00:24:52] player base so that the people that want
[00:24:54] one type of content play one game and
[00:24:55] the people that want the other type of
[00:24:56] content play the other game and they try
[00:24:57] try to keep it that way however I think
[00:24:59] it would still be in their best interest
[00:25:00] to add some form of endgame or
[00:25:02] repeatable or Co-op content that would
[00:25:04] be really cool and very POG champ and
[00:25:06] would make some players happy without
[00:25:08] anxiety the other ones if it's scalable
[00:25:10] difficulty and add cool untradeable
[00:25:11] rewards and you don't even have to show
[00:25:13] it to everyone initially you could have
[00:25:14] it locked behind [ __ ] ar-50 or
[00:25:16] something and then the like ar20 story
[00:25:18] player or the [ __ ] AR even you could
[00:25:20] put it [ __ ] behind the abyss and then
[00:25:22] if you clear 12 well oh you could go do
[00:25:24] this with your friends and then the
[00:25:25] people that don't want to do it well
[00:25:26] they won't be scared about it the people
[00:25:27] that want to do it we go do it and it'll
[00:25:29] only give like a [ __ ] it'll give like
[00:25:31] a weapon and a name and a glider and an
[00:25:32] animated name card and a pet so then
[00:25:34] it's like you're not getting Primo gems
[00:25:35] you don't have to do it well PR would be
[00:25:37] cool but you get my point you don't have
[00:25:38] to do it and then it's like oh but I
[00:25:39] want the name card okay then [ __ ] get
[00:25:41] good sorry sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:25:44] anyways we're going to play gench no

[00:39:23] this
[00:39:24] video and he said oh you're going to
[00:39:26] hate it but your chat's going to love it
[00:39:28] I don't know if I want to react to a
[00:39:30] video of me I haven't watched
[00:39:34] it maybe also in my recommended look me
[00:39:39] and I Met m on twitchcon he was cool
[00:39:40] he's wholesome this isn't like me
[00:39:42] roasting anything but in the recommended
[00:39:44] I saw I don't think finina is as good as
[00:39:46] people are saying so that feels like a
[00:39:48] video titled for me to watch it this
[00:39:50] looks like I want to click it like I
[00:39:52] feel like I have to I didn't watch it
[00:39:53] yet but I feel like I have to watch it
[00:39:54] on stream I feel like I have to cuz
[00:39:57] realistically it's probably going to be
[00:39:58] nuanced it's probably like like
[00:40:00] clickbait title and it's going to be
[00:40:01] like yeah you know you could use SRO or
[00:40:03] kakomi thanks for thanks for watching
[00:40:06] look look I'll summize the video this is
[00:40:08] what I think wait a second this is what
[00:40:09] I think the I don't think F's as good as
[00:40:11] people are saying video is going to be
[00:40:12] this is my prediction no disrespect this
[00:40:14] is my prediction hey everyone mtashed
[00:40:16] here I don't think fin is as good as
[00:40:18] people are saying then a little bit
[00:40:20] after you can play SRO you can play
[00:40:22] yolon you can play nlet you can play
[00:40:24] Child Ayo or kakomi and then time to
[00:40:27] play Family
[00:40:28] Feud and then 14 minutes long end of the
[00:40:30] video that's my guess which isn't even a
[00:40:32] bad take but she's
[00:40:35] broken like oh but how is she broken if
[00:40:37] every Hydro character is broken doesn't
[00:40:39] that mean I don't need her CU I have
[00:40:41] every Hydro character yes it you don't
[00:40:43] necessarily need her but she's so
[00:40:45] [ __ ] good in so many teams that you
[00:40:46] know what do you want me to call her bad
[00:40:48] do you want me to not [ __ ] say she's
[00:40:49] really good when she's really good
[00:40:51] obviously if you're
[00:40:53] [ __ ] obviously if you if
[00:40:56] obviously if you don't like the
[00:40:58] character and you have every Hydro
[00:40:59] character and you don't want her and
[00:41:01] you're like oh but you said she's good
[00:41:02] so I pulled for her that's kind of on
[00:41:04] you I'm sorry
[00:41:06] I I'm
[00:41:24] sorry what if I click
[00:41:26] Gamers let's talk about furina oh my God
[00:41:30] this I'm liking it okay listen listen
[00:41:32] before we watch
[00:41:34] this I didn't even know it was like that
[00:41:36] maybe I don't want to watch this no I'm
[00:41:37] going to watch it but before we do two
[00:41:39] things
[00:41:44] one I Met m he was very nice and we're
[00:41:47] watching this for fun don't listen even
[00:41:50] if you disagree even if the first thing
[00:41:51] he says is finina is ugly and I hate her
[00:41:53] you better be nice don't go be mean to
[00:41:56] other people okay okay okay I don't know
[00:41:59] what's going to happen in this video I'm
[00:42:00] just saying I don't know what's going to
[00:42:03] happen and this could go in any
[00:42:04] direction also his Fin's in the Healer
[00:42:06] stance already bad already I think she
[00:42:09] looks cute there I actually like the
[00:42:10] Healer stance mine isn't in it but I
[00:42:12] think it looks cooler okay personally I
[00:42:14] know a lot of people like the dark form
[00:42:16] I just kind of like the the contrast
[00:42:17] that's all that's all anyways that's all
[00:42:20] um um but uh we actually talked I talked
[00:42:23] to you guys about what I think about
[00:42:25] finina compared to other um um um um um
[00:42:27] Hydro characters
[00:42:29] um for example uh just know from I
[00:42:32] usually don't even write anything when I
[00:42:33] record a video I just talk like I have
[00:42:35] like key points but I don't usually
[00:42:36] write a script but for example how good
[00:42:38] is as a character overall I believe
[00:42:39] she's uh genuinely very strong for a few
[00:42:40] reasons her skill damage is really good
[00:42:42] uh her burst damage Buffs everyone
[00:42:43] including herself which means even if
[00:42:45] someone has more personal scaling like
[00:42:47] yolan in single Target well her buff
[00:42:49] only Buffs one character and it's not
[00:42:50] her whereas fin with her buff can
[00:42:52] sometimes even be higher and even if it
[00:42:53] isn't it'll buff your whole party and
[00:42:55] it'll be a big bigger buff that will
[00:42:56] contribute to more uh Team DPS generally
[00:42:58] but that's not always true because
[00:42:59] sometimes uh you don't have the Healer
[00:43:01] to substitute it sometimes you need more
[00:43:03] Hydro application which yon thinko gives
[00:43:05] you sometimes you want defensive utility
[00:43:06] which s show gives you and sometimes you
[00:43:08] have to bench your ca for Gene Gene's
[00:43:10] not a bad unit but sometimes the
[00:43:11] grouping that cazo gives you the damage
[00:43:13] bonus and all that can actually be
[00:43:15] better than you know the the gene like
[00:43:17] it depends right it depends sometimes f
[00:43:19] is better sometimes the other characters
[00:43:20] better that just is what it is right uh
[00:43:22] uh s l Hydro true but balancing away
[00:43:24] where there she isn't strictly better
[00:43:25] strictly worse true you can run double
[00:43:27] hydro which is the solution yep yep uh
[00:43:29] uh less app can be nice like quick boom
[00:43:30] true you can you have more quickens more
[00:43:32] Dental damage more Electro damage
[00:43:34] aggravate and less hyper Bloom which
[00:43:37] sometimes is bad sometimes is good you
[00:43:38] know it depends on your team your La
[00:43:39] scaling could be higher but Freo can end
[00:43:41] up doing more damage sometimes when you
[00:43:42] factor in the buff not always but
[00:43:43] sometimes but it also requires a Healer
[00:43:45] change that caus you to change your team
[00:43:46] accordingly example Kaza for Jee or
[00:43:48] Nikita for baiju right true another
[00:43:50] example is defensive utility snal
[00:43:52] provides you whereas Freedom makes you
[00:43:53] more squishy and requires good healing
[00:43:55] if you ever watch watch as a Jeff stream
[00:43:57] and you see him [ __ ] cuming every
[00:43:58] time he's talking about how nice to play
[00:44:00] and uh uh comfy sro's kit is you might
[00:44:03] you know you might be like oh [ __ ] I
[00:44:05] know what he's talking about cuz the
[00:44:06] defensive utility the rain swords the
[00:44:07] healing the the the the damage reduction
[00:44:09] right finina she's like no [ __ ] you if
[00:44:12] you're bad at the game die I don't care
[00:44:14] I'm draining your HP so that's something
[00:44:16] to keep in mind right onfield Hydra
[00:44:18] characters like nolet and Ki are
[00:44:19] obviously not replaced by her but can be
[00:44:21] enhanced by her kakomi can heal your
[00:44:23] whole team the true Hydro archon next to
[00:44:25] the new Hydro archon boom good team net
[00:44:28] with the hydro AR the new Hydro archon
[00:44:30] boom good team uh um um um um um uh
[00:44:33] genuinely team wide buff all four
[00:44:35] characters and usually that's at least
[00:44:36] three characters that are doing damage
[00:44:38] let's say your healer is a dumb [ __ ]
[00:44:39] bozo boom finina does damage boom
[00:44:41] [ __ ] [ __ ] net does damage boom
[00:44:43] official does damage like whoever's in
[00:44:45] your team right boom the situation where
[00:44:47] sron will be preferred so she's not like
[00:44:48] a power creep right she's not power
[00:44:51] creeping I think she's welld designed
[00:44:53] but also [ __ ] cracked right also
[00:44:55] really good because whenever you can run
[00:44:58] over with another Hydro even though you
[00:44:59] don't always need another Hydro you be
[00:45:01] monoh Hydro like solo Hydro but if you
[00:45:03] need another Hydro boom you can yolan uh
[00:45:05] oh people like oh yolan or Singo both
[00:45:07] [ __ ] play them together finina or Yan
[00:45:10] both play them together I believe she's
[00:45:12] powerful but welld designed very
[00:45:15] versatile oh that is leaks what is this
[00:45:18] oh this just the clear I wanted to do uh
[00:45:20] very versatile very good highly command
[00:45:22] don't feel
[00:45:24] forced
[00:45:26] anyways I started yapping oh yeah I also
[00:45:28] I was like what are these numbers I was
[00:45:30] calculating the HP drain cuz she wasn't
[00:45:33] like out so I was trying to calculate
[00:45:35] how much HP I lost in a rotation and it
[00:45:38] was around 40 it varied anyways yeah
[00:45:41] that's all seen very underrated you have
[00:45:44] to watch that clip video it's so good
[00:45:46] this is great but the first sound made
[00:45:48] when fin does the bubble blowing
[00:45:49] animation sounds like the Pokemon in
[00:45:51] battle sound
[00:45:54] what the first sound made when frina
[00:45:56] does the bubble blowing Idol animation
[00:45:58] sounds like the Pokemon in-game healing
[00:46:01] sound this is great and all but the
[00:46:04] first sound made does the bubble blowing
[00:46:07] idle animation sounds like the Pokémon
[00:46:09] in battle healing sound okay uh if you
[00:46:12] just made me waste time you will be
[00:46:13] banned so she better make that sound she
[00:46:16] just sat on a
[00:46:18] bubble all good let her sit all
[00:46:24] good
[00:46:30] sorry wrong Idol please do the right
[00:46:39] Idol okay I don't hear it I'm sorry I've
[00:46:41] played every Pokemon game but I don't
[00:46:42] hear it I don't know maybe you hear it
[00:46:44] anyways uh come out 21 months W Weir
[00:46:51] okay let's watch this at least a bit of
[00:46:52] it but keep in mind everything I said
[00:46:54] earlier one be nice two two like you
[00:46:56] know be nice and three it's probably
[00:46:58] just going to be hey she's good but do
[00:47:00] you need her cuz yolan sing Cho Ki nette
[00:47:02] that's it thanks for watching She's you
[00:47:04] know to [ __ ] forina but yeah that's all
[00:47:06] okay that's my
[00:47:09] prediction uh this is an interesting one
[00:47:12] um I built furina up I ended up getting
[00:47:14] quite lucky listen I know that my
[00:47:17] pronunciation on characters isn't the
[00:47:19] best sometimes it is example
[00:47:22] sing sorry but it's not furina any all
[00:47:26] good all good no big deal no big deal
[00:47:27] all good one uh I did a couple me it
[00:47:30] happens my first ning Wang video I
[00:47:31] called her ning Wang cuz I didn't know
[00:47:33] my first Ryden video I called her ball
[00:47:34] cuz I thought her name was ball and then
[00:47:35] oh oh plot Twisted ball is the puppet
[00:47:37] it's it's eyes PS and we got the arena
[00:47:41] C1 which is good because uh
[00:47:45] C1 can we talk about what Fin's [ __ ]
[00:47:48] constellations are what why is it called
[00:47:50] love is a rebellious bird that none can
[00:47:52] tame why is it called a woman adapts
[00:47:54] like duckweed and water what even is a
[00:47:56] duckweed matter of fact what even is
[00:47:59] water enough to counter my terrible
[00:48:02] artifacts my AR oh names of plays okay
[00:48:05] that's kind of five wow okay I just
[00:48:08] exposed myself for being dumb finina you
[00:48:10] well played finina she she's more
[00:48:12] cultured than I am honestly honestly
[00:48:16] well played fair enough well played is
[00:48:19] strong enough to counter my terrible
[00:48:22] artifacts my artifacts are terrible
[00:48:26] I have a terrible set on her
[00:48:27] realistically compared to what she could
[00:48:29] be her her Effectiveness is a fraction
[00:48:31] of what it could be and I still think
[00:48:33] she was
[00:48:43] good um this is a tough one for me and
[00:48:46] and I want I want you to really listen
[00:48:47] to me here okay some people are going to
[00:48:50] make a video and they're going to be
[00:48:51] like furina is amazing it's sees and I I
[00:48:53] recommend it I feel like people are not
[00:48:56] honest in this game about characters and
[00:48:58] I understand that sometimes I'm a feels
[00:49:00] crafter and I don't have like the best
[00:49:02] math but I I want to at least Enlighten
[00:49:04] you on a couple things yeah okay so I
[00:49:06] think that for the record if a character
[00:49:08] is bad I'll tell you they're bad or I'll
[00:49:09] tell you they're mid like sometimes I
[00:49:10] don't want to like make a guy and be
[00:49:11] like [ __ ] on the character because
[00:49:12] if you watch a guide you want to know
[00:49:13] how like when they're good for example
[00:49:14] rizzly I didn't like clickbait them I
[00:49:16] just call it strong this rizzly build
[00:49:17] because I don't think he's like broken
[00:49:18] but he's decent right de I called her
[00:49:20] bad obviously she's getting better with
[00:49:22] new characters you can argue she's
[00:49:24] pretty good in a net team Lenny helped
[00:49:26] her out like I'm not [ __ ] on
[00:49:27] characters I'm just pretty honest right
[00:49:29] I know like some people got mad at me
[00:49:31] when I said Dale wasn't the best but I'm
[00:49:32] I didn't design her okay I like her I
[00:49:35] think she's pretty I think she's cool
[00:49:36] one of my favorite Su listen I'm not the
[00:49:38] dev okay I'm just being
[00:49:40] honest but finina it's pretty good do
[00:49:43] you need her no you can play cro yolan
[00:49:46] with your Hut and then your other team
[00:49:47] you probably don't need a well you
[00:49:48] probably do want a hydro but maybe have
[00:49:49] never let right I'll let him talk I'm
[00:49:51] sorry the arena good probably worth
[00:49:55] getting probably worth getting for
[00:49:56] almost anyone but I also think that some
[00:49:59] people can abuse this unit more than
[00:50:01] others I also think that furina is kind
[00:50:03] of an endgame unit and what I mean by
[00:50:06] that is I think like a new player
[00:50:08] jumping in the game getting
[00:50:10] finina can not abuse her the way a whale
[00:50:15] or a long-term player can abuse her okay
[00:50:18] H I agree or disagree I I know what
[00:50:19] you're going to say uh I you're going to
[00:50:21] say okay she drains her HP and then if
[00:50:23] you're not healing you don't get much
[00:50:24] Buffs on your burst true but also if
[00:50:26] you're a new player and you're like
[00:50:27] exploring with finina there's a good
[00:50:28] chance I was talking to Fang about
[00:50:30] finina she's like oh my God I can't wait
[00:50:31] to play her in her healing form it's
[00:50:32] like if you're exploring and you're
[00:50:33] chilling and you're having fun her
[00:50:34] healing is actually really nice like
[00:50:36] don't play as a Healer for like abyss
[00:50:38] and stuff but it's like if you're doing
[00:50:39] the abyss you can press e for damage and
[00:50:41] then heal and if you're doing like just
[00:50:43] normal Overworld stuff you can just heal
[00:50:44] with
[00:50:46] her I think she is effective I think she
[00:50:49] is good in multiple situations I think
[00:50:51] she's versatile and I think she has my
[00:50:53] instant stamp of approval even though
[00:50:55] mine trashed here but soaring issues and
[00:51:00] I'm noticing some issues with a lot of
[00:51:02] the characters on my roster and I think
[00:51:04] this is is definitely a bit of a a yo
[00:51:06] okay no disrespect why is aloy Chi-Chi
[00:51:10] okay Noel got better with finina but why
[00:51:11] are these characters like the higher
[00:51:13] leveled ones issue or did you scroll
[00:51:15] really far maybe scroll really far
[00:51:16] explain so let's talk about no yeah
[00:51:19] scroll really far my bad my bad he troll
[00:51:20] really far my bad good the good is do a
[00:51:23] surprising amount more than you have bro
[00:51:27] let the people rejoice as you leveled
[00:51:29] your skill
[00:51:30] before even though I don't have her
[00:51:32] final Ascension even though my relics or
[00:51:35] artifacts are terrible I don't have all
[00:51:37] her talents done she's hitting pretty
[00:51:40] hard she's hitting quite hard as for her
[00:51:44] healing it's three or 4,000 HP it's fine
[00:51:48] but I see this as a sub DPS true um you
[00:51:52] can use your healing in a pinch um but
[00:51:55] the thing is is like if you want to heal
[00:51:57] in a pinch you also have to swap to her
[00:51:59] and then charge attack and then swap
[00:52:01] back to get the healing on the unit very
[00:52:04] clunky so for me I would rather just use
[00:52:06] her as a sub DPS true and um she she
[00:52:10] does hit pretty
[00:52:11] hard and her ultimate is very solid um
[00:52:16] it gives you bonus damage well it does a
[00:52:18] little bit of damage it gives your team
[00:52:20] bonus damage for the record chat uh
[00:52:21] level gives 15% damage uh it's it's
[00:52:26] multiplied by the stacks but5 for like
[00:52:29] as the conversion ratio when you max it
[00:52:31] it's 25 which is like wait why do I not
[00:52:34] remember is it actually 25 am I stupid
[00:52:35] is it 30 how much is it yeah 25 yeah
[00:52:38] yeah
[00:52:39] wait why do I not remember I just made
[00:52:41] the guide whatever and it also gives you
[00:52:44] increased healing bonus which means that
[00:52:48] when you pair her with some of the AOE
[00:52:50] healers like a Barbara or like my
[00:52:53] terrible unbuilt genan I can heal pretty
[00:52:56] much from Z to 100 it's cracked yep and
[00:53:01] um I think that I think that there's
[00:53:03] some really interesting potential with
[00:53:05] using different healers with furina yep
[00:53:07] uh on top of that if you do overheal now
[00:53:11] furina starts to kill I thought that any
[00:53:14] healing from a different Source would
[00:53:16] cause this and if that was the case she
[00:53:18] would be busted I would I would
[00:53:19] recommend her to
[00:53:21] anyone
[00:53:22] listen listen if
[00:53:25] if you not healing enough is the end all
[00:53:28] be for finina just play a better healer
[00:53:31] you might be like Oho I don't have a
[00:53:32] better healer bro Noel is actually
[00:53:35] pretty good with finina like that's how
[00:53:37] good finina is if you have enough
[00:53:38] healing Noel literally becomes better
[00:53:40] than EO arguably don't get mad at me I'm
[00:53:41] just saying
[00:53:44] like but it is you do need the healing
[00:53:46] it is true that you might want to bench
[00:53:48] kazua for genene right which is like
[00:53:50] damn my [ __ ] Kazo like I don't want
[00:53:52] to do that can use him on the other team
[00:53:54] or you could do Kaza and then like Ki or
[00:53:55] like you know whatever but you know it
[00:53:58] is something I would say that she is
[00:54:00] absolutely Gods here but unfortunately
[00:54:03] this only applies with overhealing
[00:54:06] overflowing so she doesn't work with
[00:54:08] Bennett slower healers or like overtime
[00:54:11] healers um like a shing Cho or a kuki
[00:54:15] shinobu they're not going to to function
[00:54:18] as good with her and you can't abuse it
[00:54:21] but this would have been
[00:54:22] amazing and then this is also just you
[00:54:25] know some more value but sure I think
[00:54:28] that in most team comps in most
[00:54:31] situations furina good true but I feel
[00:54:35] this naging thing in the back of my mind
[00:54:39] saying I can't maximize her I can't
[00:54:42] optimize her I don't feel like I can
[00:54:44] abuse
[00:54:45] her as well as some other people could
[00:54:49] and I want I am stopping myself from
[00:54:51] saying skill issue I to explain that I
[00:54:53] want to explain that is even though
[00:54:55] she's got good damage and she can boost
[00:54:58] up the damage of my
[00:55:00] team so can this
[00:55:03] chick and um um actually um actually
[00:55:07] Fin's buff Buffs herself and every party
[00:55:09] member which means the buff is actually
[00:55:11] way higher than this chick in quotations
[00:55:14] that only Buffs your active character
[00:55:15] still Yan's still amazing don't get me
[00:55:17] wrong but it's different Buffs also also
[00:55:21] also you can use them
[00:55:22] together so can this chick without any
[00:55:27] downsides
[00:55:29] whatsoever and when you start taking the
[00:55:32] healing and things out of the kit I
[00:55:34] start questioning is yon just a better
[00:55:37] unit for me and for a lot of the comps
[00:55:40] that I
[00:55:41] use uh for the record chat before I
[00:55:44] don't want to keep pausing but I'm just
[00:55:45] saying this is a very like how he feels
[00:55:47] about the character video so like don't
[00:55:48] be mad at it he's just talking about how
[00:55:49] he feels like even the titles I don't
[00:55:51] think and now he's talking about for him
[00:55:52] so like but yeah it's like well I will
[00:55:55] roast it but like say fine is amazing
[00:55:59] they work in different teams I suppose
[00:56:01] but Primo gem is a Primo gem is a Primo
[00:56:04] Gem and if you don't have some of the
[00:56:06] key units to make her god tier would you
[00:56:10] just be better off with yon and when I
[00:56:12] look at my account and when I test out
[00:56:14] the teams that I did I'm starting to
[00:56:16] feel like I kind of kind of a little bit
[00:56:20] let me explain I tried a lot of
[00:56:23] different things okay
[00:56:26] I've considered some sort of like weird
[00:56:29] like min max one
[00:56:31] bang respectfully respectfully what in
[00:56:35] the ever loving [ __ ] is this team
[00:56:38] respectfully okay it's actually fine I
[00:56:40] it's actually fine
[00:56:42] right okay I actually talked to zag
[00:56:46] about like Ryden finina like R in
[00:56:49] National with finina but wouldn't you
[00:56:51] play Shang Ling not kazua and also
[00:56:56] wouldn't
[00:56:58] you in this
[00:57:00] team it makes
[00:57:07] sense Bennett only Buffs Ryden and
[00:57:09] Ryan's great but Bennett doesn't buff
[00:57:12] finina Bennett doesn't heal enough for
[00:57:14] finina unless you're swapping through
[00:57:15] your characters and if you're swapping
[00:57:16] through your characters I mean you might
[00:57:19] be able to with rden she has downtime
[00:57:21] I'm just going to shut up everything
[00:57:22] ride and shun and it could work but it's
[00:57:25] probably not optimal yeah true um okay
[00:57:27] he knows know tried some hyper Bloom
[00:57:30] type stuff um with different units uh I
[00:57:34] didn't Bennett Bennett doesn't work with
[00:57:36] her great I I Bennett is more valuable
[00:57:38] on a different team in my opinion haded
[00:57:40] Bennett I tried some hyper Bloom Ki
[00:57:42] shobu stuff um I tried shincho little
[00:57:45] bit to Healing here and there oh my God
[00:57:47] this poor soul oh no wonder oh my God
[00:57:50] wait a second wait a second wait a
[00:57:52] second Jean's not in his party
[00:57:55] he doesn't have Vu yao yao is nowhere to
[00:57:58] be seen okay we ask kokomi so if you're
[00:58:02] playing hyper blo with her uh well not
[00:58:03] just Hy like in general you could on
[00:58:04] feel Ki you could also alternatively use
[00:58:06] your jean who's right there but let's
[00:58:08] keep going uh I've tried diona you know
[00:58:12] some shielding some healing I've tried
[00:58:14] everything um but some of the key things
[00:58:16] that I noticed was
[00:58:18] why to me felt the best because of the
[00:58:21] bursting heal I saw that weapon no I saw
[00:58:24] that weap weon I saw that weapon I tried
[00:58:27] everything um but some of the key why is
[00:58:29] this
[00:58:30] a was Gan for me felt the best because
[00:58:35] of the bursting heal uh furina does
[00:58:39] drain a lot of your HP true and
[00:58:40] depending on the enemies you're fighting
[00:58:41] like if you're fighting these these dog
[00:58:44] things yeah are annoying the CYS is kind
[00:58:46] of annoying dog guys yeah I agree I
[00:58:48] agree the current this the second half
[00:58:50] is kind of annoying in some fora teams
[00:58:51] you have barely enough healing cuz it
[00:58:53] feels like it's like in the game because
[00:58:55] of their bleeding you can just dodge
[00:58:57] attacks but anything that um like
[00:59:00] there's some fights with these black
[00:59:01] serenus guys and they're like swinging
[00:59:03] like these they're swinging the big
[00:59:04] thing and they can hit really hard they
[00:59:05] got big AOE um some of these enemies
[00:59:08] that are more Elite the hilly roges um
[00:59:11] some of these
[00:59:13] guys getting your HP drained to 50% and
[00:59:16] then getting tagged you can get one shot
[00:59:19] uh because furina is is draining that HP
[00:59:22] and because he's comparing her to yolan
[00:59:24] is a bit less true but if you're
[00:59:26] comparing to sing TR it's very it is
[00:59:28] true okay I I this is also one of zest
[00:59:30] takes not how M said it but where it's
[00:59:33] like sing gives you a lot of defensive
[00:59:34] utility and then finina drains your HP
[00:59:36] instead so it's like you can feel a lot
[00:59:37] squishier which is true in 123 second
[00:59:40] half or first half sometimes I died hey
[00:59:42] I'll be honest no I've never died but
[00:59:44] sometimes you take a lot of damage right
[00:59:45] like sing will give you defensive
[00:59:46] utility healing and like he feels comfy
[00:59:49] right and then Freo will be like dude
[00:59:53] [ __ ] you if you die you're dumb so that
[00:59:55] is true BL are prime
[00:59:58] actually not good at dodging I honestly
[01:00:01] think that like fiorina good but also
[01:00:04] potentially putting your team at risk
[01:00:06] and so true um I can imagine that
[01:00:08] fiorina while her her like ease of use
[01:00:12] just like placing her
[01:00:14] abilities would be good on mobile I
[01:00:17] could also see her her like getting
[01:00:19] people killed on mobile who can't Dodge
[01:00:21] is good so that's just something i' I
[01:00:23] I've noticed and so to mitigate that I
[01:00:25] did find that A bursty Healer uh felt
[01:00:29] really good you could also swap to
[01:00:31] someone like kakomi and get some healing
[01:00:33] for your team but it doesn't feel as
[01:00:35] good because kakomi has to do like her
[01:00:38] she's got her
[01:00:42] pass are you shitalking my wife you take
[01:00:45] that back you take that back young
[01:00:48] man um and then you can burst and and
[01:00:50] heal up your team and chunk it up you
[01:00:52] take that back doesn't feel as nice as
[01:00:54] being that
[01:00:56] back through I agree quick swapping is
[01:00:58] sick but if you're playing kakomi with
[01:01:00] finina you play her
[01:01:01] onfield or you run with another healer
[01:01:03] you can do if your healer is not the
[01:01:04] best you can always run a prototype
[01:01:05] Amber or like like you run a protype
[01:01:07] Amber or like another character who's
[01:01:09] like like let's say you're playing hyper
[01:01:11] you can do kakomi on field but let's say
[01:01:12] you don't want on field you could also
[01:01:13] have a kie there two like relatively
[01:01:16] okay healers make a good
[01:01:18] healer get a bursty heal from um you
[01:01:21] know Jean Barbara and un
[01:01:25] this is this is why I'm starting to feel
[01:01:26] this is like I test outu I look ATU and
[01:01:30] it's like I'm not going to recommend you
[01:01:31] get BYU because you got furina but some
[01:01:34] has BYU can pair them together and it's
[01:01:36] like well obviously it's a good
[01:01:38] team you can do hyper Bloom teams with
[01:01:40] BYU in the team he can AOE heal he can
[01:01:43] Shield your team he makes it safer like
[01:01:45] he would be a really good option but
[01:01:48] even if it's not the bayu that's tilting
[01:01:50] me a little bit for the record uh my
[01:01:52] Charlotte video is out soon the Char on
[01:01:54] lot I used a level 85 codex on like
[01:01:57] pretty dog [ __ ] artifacts and I always
[01:01:59] had enough healing even though my build
[01:02:01] was [ __ ] now granted I was level eight
[01:02:03] talent and also granted when I say full
[01:02:05] heal usually it's from 50% HP is so cuz
[01:02:08] you're not going to get your freen out
[01:02:09] on one HP right if you do skill issue it
[01:02:11] might take a bit longer to heal unless
[01:02:12] you have C1 charlot good investment then
[01:02:14] you can full heal but like for me for my
[01:02:16] testing my duuke was like 1 HP full
[01:02:18] healed to like 20K or whatever and then
[01:02:20] my finina was half HP full healed like
[01:02:23] obviously if you're 50K HP HP scaling
[01:02:25] character is low it might not insta full
[01:02:27] heal like even charlot who like
[01:02:29] literally just presses q and like
[01:02:31] obviously charlott's a good like
[01:02:32] surprisingly good forar healer but it's
[01:02:34] like what else does she do for your team
[01:02:35] okay supportive weapon supportive
[01:02:37] artifact set but all she does is heal
[01:02:38] pretty much and it's like that's enough
[01:02:41] to make finina really good because of
[01:02:44] how much damage she gives you and her
[01:02:46] personal damage also you can play Lua
[01:02:48] sorry wrong game IU that's tilting me a
[01:02:51] little bit I look at this bad boy right
[01:02:54] here here I didn't pull him net net so
[01:02:58] broken I feel like broken pairing i n
[01:03:01] nuet able to heal and heal himself and
[01:03:05] lose his HP with fiorina who's up and
[01:03:08] down on HP and some other healer it's so
[01:03:11] easy to stack her up and get max value
[01:03:13] that it's like I don't have a I feel
[01:03:16] like I don't have a key component to
[01:03:18] make furina as good as
[01:03:20] possible and um I don't know I don't
[01:03:25] have ch who can drain HP you know
[01:03:31] there's I mean honestly respectable
[01:03:35] pulls but why do you not have Shia Shia
[01:03:37] who can drain HP you know there's no who
[01:03:40] or Shenanigans with her I feel like
[01:03:43] maybe some of my issue with the
[01:03:45] character is like maybe I just don't
[01:03:48] have the right carries or DPS to work I
[01:03:51] tried um you know do have
[01:03:55] teams actually feel pretty good do you
[01:03:56] have a
[01:03:57] them dude this guy
[01:04:00] has okay you literally skipped every
[01:04:03] [ __ ] finina character granted she can
[01:04:04] be used on a lot of teams so like there
[01:04:06] still probably are good teams for you
[01:04:07] but like you literally no out height
[01:04:09] them no wander or Shia that can work no
[01:04:12] nlet no [ __ ] Hut no yo Mia there's
[01:04:17] still other teams you can play but like
[01:04:18] know there's no Hut mechanics or or
[01:04:20] Shenanigans with her I feel like maybe
[01:04:23] some of my issue with the character is
[01:04:25] like maybe I just don't have the right
[01:04:28] carries or DPS to work I tried um you
[01:04:32] know fre play no no I know I know I know
[01:04:34] I'm not I don't listen I'm not going to
[01:04:36] [ __ ] shame someone for
[01:04:37] like I don't encourage spending like I'm
[01:04:39] not like if you want to spend and you
[01:04:40] enjoy it like you don't regret it then
[01:04:42] cool and if you don't want to spend
[01:04:44] because you're spending on a game and
[01:04:45] you like why would I spend that's cool
[01:04:46] too right whatever you like I don't care
[01:04:48] I'm just
[01:04:49] saying there's a lot of extremely high
[01:04:52] value characters he doesn't have that
[01:04:53] would work well with Fino that's not
[01:04:54] like hey that it is what it is but I
[01:04:56] also think finina let's say you have
[01:04:57] like barely any characters you want so
[01:05:00] this is my take of all time I've always
[01:05:02] said this the hydro characters Hydro
[01:05:04] five stars are better the less Hydro
[01:05:06] five stars you have for example you can
[01:05:07] use kakomi with like every Hydro
[01:05:09] reaction you can IO like every Hydra
[01:05:11] nevet every Hydra finina every Hydra
[01:05:12] reaction even child but he's mostly for
[01:05:14] Shang Ling but even if you don't have
[01:05:15] other hydras like the more hydras you
[01:05:17] have the more they can slot into so many
[01:05:18] teams or the less hydras you have the
[01:05:20] more getting a new one is good because
[01:05:22] you can use them in so many different
[01:05:23] teams and Hydra are all really good for
[01:05:25] the most part well all of them actually
[01:05:26] and even like mono Hydro teams are good
[01:05:28] and like s TR is broken so like it's
[01:05:32] yeah so even for like a new player I
[01:05:34] think finina is a good idea you need to
[01:05:37] be mindful of her downsides like yeah
[01:05:38] you drain some HP yeah like there's
[01:05:41] Replacements like Alternatives but like
[01:05:43] is like maybe I just don't have the
[01:05:46] right carries or DPS to work I tried um
[01:05:50] you know a comp like this what team with
[01:05:53] um um aato I used ayato I wait just use
[01:05:57] ki wait a second wait a second okay I
[01:06:00] love IO rank one IO by the way just play
[01:06:02] kakomi then finina and then you have
[01:06:04] enough healing you can onfield her you
[01:06:06] have two oh my God you have kakomi
[01:06:08] finina yolan you're comparing her to
[01:06:10] yolan Boom play them in a team double
[01:06:12] Hydro archon kakomi finina yolan Kazo
[01:06:16] you actually have a monoh hydro team and
[01:06:17] I [ __ ] hate monoh Hydra usually but
[01:06:19] finina actually makes it cool and gives
[01:06:20] me a reason to not just give me a reason
[01:06:23] just gives me a reason not to just be
[01:06:25] like dude [ __ ] dumbass play Electro
[01:06:27] character and then you have Electro
[01:06:28] charge why would you monoh hydro sorry I
[01:06:30] don't want being toxic I'm talking to
[01:06:31] myself anyways uh monoh Hydra actually
[01:06:33] works there alternatively uh whatever IO
[01:06:36] team you were planning on playing just
[01:06:37] put kakomi on field you'll be comfy you
[01:06:39] have finina let's say you want to hyper
[01:06:40] Bloom boom Nita Ki Nita em Ryden Nita
[01:06:42] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] uh I was gonna
[01:06:45] say Dory but don't go Dory Okay use
[01:06:46] Shang
[01:06:47] Lang and I used Bennett and this one
[01:06:51] felt really solid
[01:06:55] I
[01:06:57] mean sure really really good I would
[01:07:00] argue it's probably better to go Kazo
[01:07:02] and then literally your only onfield
[01:07:04] presence is funneling particles for your
[01:07:06] pyron you're sh go less ER and then
[01:07:08] you're just quick sving between
[01:07:09] characters um but
[01:07:11] sure I guess would my team be better if
[01:07:14] I just had Kazu up wait did I get raided
[01:07:16] my my team just be better if I just I
[01:07:19] appreciate it though oh [ __ ] [ __ ] sorry
[01:07:21] I'll go back if I threw yon in here and
[01:07:24] I just made sure all my Vapes were from
[01:07:26] Shang langing um I don't know I don't
[01:07:32] know if it's a me issue and it's my
[01:07:35] account or if other people are going to
[01:07:37] feel this way now remember my fena is
[01:07:41] not so if my damage numbers were higher
[01:07:43] and I was clearing the abyss faster
[01:07:46] maybe maybe I gloss over these things
[01:07:48] but in the current stage of my account
[01:07:50] and the current feelings that I have I
[01:07:52] think she is
[01:07:55] worth but I'm not feeling personally
[01:07:59] like oh my God she's a game changer the
[01:08:02] way I did with um kazua or oh Ryden
[01:08:06] Shogun okay I'm gonna say it Ryden simps
[01:08:09] you can get mad at me I love Ry I think
[01:08:10] she's very cool I like her sword I think
[01:08:13] finina is better I'm not here to start
[01:08:15] beef you might be like oh SC I I need to
[01:08:17] play rational team cuz it helps that's
[01:08:20] cool you can play Ryden she can be
[01:08:22] played in EM she can be played with with
[01:08:23] Shang Ling uh Ryden also helps solve
[01:08:26] skill issue finina punishes do for skill
[01:08:28] issue she drains your HP if you're not
[01:08:30] healing you're not buffing your team
[01:08:31] you're going to suck with finina Ryden
[01:08:33] you don't know how to manage energy you
[01:08:35] press Q all of your energy is back
[01:08:38] up which makes her very friendly that
[01:08:40] makes her better her C2 can make her a
[01:08:42] hyper carry her em can make her hyper
[01:08:44] blo right however finina I think even if
[01:08:49] you so power level wise she's really
[01:08:50] good but even if you're not talking
[01:08:52] about power level right
[01:08:54] you she's like he he said I don't think
[01:08:56] she's a game changer again this is your
[01:08:58] opinion I'm not tagging for it I would
[01:09:00] say personally she objectively is a game
[01:09:02] changer because now you actually need
[01:09:05] healing there's a reason to play A
[01:09:06] Healer if I'm playing a Healer before
[01:09:09] finina the only reason I'm picking them
[01:09:11] is for what they buff you benett gives
[01:09:12] you attack koui hyper blooms BYU gives
[01:09:15] you a nice shield for resistance
[01:09:16] Interruption some dendr application and
[01:09:18] his shield when it pops it Buffs your
[01:09:20] reactions like there's reasons to play
[01:09:22] healers that aren't just healing I would
[01:09:23] if you played attack uh uh goblet and
[01:09:26] healing bonus circlet on Gene before
[01:09:28] finina I would be like why are you doing
[01:09:30] that I just go crit and deal damage now
[01:09:32] you're actually building healing you're
[01:09:33] actually playing healers you're actually
[01:09:35] like oh my God I might actually rather
[01:09:36] play like BYU than Nita in a team even
[01:09:39] though Nita super broken right like
[01:09:40] obviously you can swab your stuff around
[01:09:42] but it's like there's actually a reason
[01:09:44] to play healers to build healers for
[01:09:46] healing and it completely changes your
[01:09:48] teams you're going instead of going like
[01:09:50] example instead of going
[01:09:52] kazua uh uh uh kazua kuki you might go
[01:09:55] like a better [ __ ] Electro healer
[01:09:57] there's none Electro healer suck let me
[01:09:58] rephrase that instead of going kazua
[01:10:00] kuki you might go [ __ ] Jean cookie
[01:10:03] but then you have two he you get my
[01:10:04] point that was a bad example let me
[01:10:05] rephrase that instead of Nito you might
[01:10:06] go Buu instead of Kazo you might go Gan
[01:10:08] instead of instead of instead of IO you
[01:10:09] might call me you get me you get me and
[01:10:12] and I think that right is easier and
[01:10:13] cheaper easier sure cheaper huh finina
[01:10:17] how expensive is finina freeto play
[01:10:19] weapons really good festering's amazing
[01:10:20] and if you don't have it the FL s is
[01:10:22] really good teams are extremely flexible
[01:10:24] so then we talk about okay how expensive
[01:10:25] like how hard is it to build her guilded
[01:10:27] uh the new domain is a new domain so not
[01:10:29] everyone has it but it's an extremely
[01:10:30] efficient domain so everyone should do
[01:10:33] it your goblet could be HP which is
[01:10:35] super easy to get your sand could be HP
[01:10:38] but it could also be recharging your
[01:10:41] energy I don't think she's that
[01:10:44] expensive I mean she gets better with
[01:10:46] investment but it's like yeah Ryden also
[01:10:49] has the catch I I don't think she's
[01:10:51] necessarily it's it's expensive I really
[01:10:53] do think it's a me issue so if anything
[01:10:55] Ryden as a hyper carry would need
[01:10:56] investment to actually perform well but
[01:10:57] you don't need to hyper carry your Ryden
[01:10:59] you can play her with in hyper or you
[01:11:00] can play her with Shang link take this
[01:11:02] with a big juicy grain of salt I would
[01:11:05] really recommend you watch someone who's
[01:11:07] got NAD watch someone who's got car with
[01:11:09] investment yes but I have to explain
[01:11:11] this it depends so hyper yes but hyper
[01:11:13] carries the more you invest to the
[01:11:15] you'll see way more damage like almost
[01:11:17] exponentially right a sha that sucks
[01:11:19] balls your whole team's going to suck
[01:11:21] cuz the rest of your party is buffing
[01:11:22] your Sha but a sh that's well invested
[01:11:23] you're going to feel like oh my God I
[01:11:24] can actually clear everything cuz the
[01:11:26] rest of your team is just buffing him
[01:11:27] whereas if like your Bennett has like my
[01:11:30] Bennett has like a geog goblet but ER
[01:11:32] subsat you're fine like it doesn't
[01:11:33] matter right even with like like let's
[01:11:36] say I don't want to use child let's say
[01:11:38] like what's a good example basically
[01:11:39] most supports also some DPS is even with
[01:11:42] like minimal investment they can still
[01:11:43] perform well because of other factors
[01:11:45] example if you're playing like a um like
[01:11:47] a freeze team H I don't want to use a
[01:11:50] freeze team as what's the best example
[01:11:51] of this reaction comps like hyper blo
[01:11:53] you don't need the best artifacts you
[01:11:54] just need em if your KGI has dog [ __ ]
[01:11:56] substats and your hydro character on
[01:11:58] field isn't the strongest while you're
[01:12:00] hyper boming for like 30k cuz you have
[01:12:01] em it's fine units to play around with
[01:12:04] because you know I I don't have every
[01:12:06] single character in the game on this
[01:12:08] account and I I think that some of the
[01:12:11] gaps in my roster are impacting my my
[01:12:14] enjoyment would you say they impacting
[01:12:16] characters come out that will will
[01:12:18] impact uh how I feel about her but for
[01:12:20] right now if I if I look at her and I
[01:12:24] play with her and maybe you
[01:12:27] know maybe maybe if I did the math and I
[01:12:30] actually had a big brain I wouldn't say
[01:12:32] this but feels craft
[01:12:36] mtashed
[01:12:38] personally I I would rather have my
[01:12:40] yalon in a lot of the comps that I've
[01:12:43] tested but also I know this is like
[01:12:44] Fields craft and he's admitting that
[01:12:46] it's fieldcraft but like dude y yon is
[01:12:50] 1010 probably Max invested since you
[01:12:52] started getting her and then your Fina
[01:12:55] is like barely on life support like I
[01:12:57] get it look I and also frina might not
[01:13:00] feel as nice if you have like no healing
[01:13:01] like I get it okay but it's also like
[01:13:03] dude all good all good let me go back to
[01:13:05] where I did the math ashed
[01:13:10] personally I and also like I don't think
[01:13:12] it's really a competition between them
[01:13:13] because just play both yon in a lot of
[01:13:16] the comps that I've tested I would
[01:13:18] rather have kazua and a lot of comps
[01:13:20] that I've tested and like there's only
[01:13:22] four slots there's only four four
[01:13:24] different slots available true and um
[01:13:27] things start getting congested when you
[01:13:29] look at the meta characters when when he
[01:13:32] did the he said he did someone got to be
[01:13:34] really good to replace this guy and then
[01:13:36] when someone like yon exists it's like
[01:13:38] well they got to be really good to
[01:13:39] replace her and when kazua exists again
[01:13:42] it's like someone has to be really good
[01:13:45] iron sting it's a free Play account
[01:13:47] maybe he does not I'll dude the fact
[01:13:50] that he's able to do so much um
[01:13:54] it
[01:13:55] skews how much I value other
[01:13:58] characters a
[01:14:00] lot so see like I see a question chat
[01:14:02] it's like I'm free to play should I wish
[01:14:03] for fre or wait for Ryden it's like
[01:14:05] genuinely it depends on what you want
[01:14:07] like if you're asking the meta answer it
[01:14:08] also depends on your teams but fina's
[01:14:10] pretty cracked but it's like if you're
[01:14:12] like dude I love Ryden she's sick she's
[01:14:13] also really good like I don't want to be
[01:14:15] like the reason you pick one or the
[01:14:17] other when it's like both can do well I
[01:14:19] think finina because she's a Support
[01:14:21] also this is a big thing support
[01:14:23] character tend to be a lot more valuable
[01:14:24] to your overall account than DPS
[01:14:26] characters I can name you 56 sing show
[01:14:28] teams I can name you five Shia teams I
[01:14:31] love Shia he's my favorite character I
[01:14:32] think he's great especially if you
[01:14:33] invest into him you have good supports
[01:14:35] for him like you know y ya but it's like
[01:14:37] would I recommend Shia over like a
[01:14:40] really good support character that you
[01:14:41] can play in like 50 teams no unless you
[01:14:43] really like him and want to main DPS him
[01:14:45] similar with Ryden but Ryden could also
[01:14:46] be played in hyper
[01:14:48] blo Ryden does have more teams though
[01:14:51] but she does require like to be you have
[01:14:53] to play around
[01:14:55] her right is hot though true she
[01:14:58] is so I'm biased name those 56 teams
[01:15:02] okay you want to hear 56 uh uh sing show
[01:15:05] teams count them t no maybe not tanari y
[01:15:08] Miko finina baiju Shia kazuwa Soo Ryden
[01:15:12] kaching alham n n not really
[01:15:17] nuu sure yolan kakomi hut sugr Kaa Ki
[01:15:22] Fishel
[01:15:23] shinan Bennett Elisa
[01:15:27] anyways I'm very very biased when I talk
[01:15:30] about units in the game but I would at
[01:15:34] least implore you to listen to my
[01:15:37] thoughts because I feel like I
[01:15:40] don't I don't sugarcoat
[01:15:43] it and I I I'm not in the hoyo verse
[01:15:47] pocket like I'm not I'm not getting paid
[01:15:49] from them I respect that so I I'm not
[01:15:51] going to I'm not going lays over some of
[01:15:54] these things that feel a little bit
[01:15:55] frustrating to me I get it she's good
[01:15:57] and and but it's just like I I I don't
[01:16:00] want to ever push someone into a unit
[01:16:02] and then they're like this isn't cracked
[01:16:05] I know for a fact some of them are
[01:16:08] cracked and I will always recommend them
[01:16:10] and I see the potential but I'm not
[01:16:12] getting this feeling of like oh my god
[01:16:14] get her
[01:16:17] now um okay but I've never had the
[01:16:19] feeling of oh my god get her now ever
[01:16:21] for any character
[01:16:23] except maybe no I don't dude cuz like
[01:16:27] bro if you say that in a gacha game it's
[01:16:29] like kind
[01:16:31] of yeah I want to say Nita cuz also at
[01:16:33] the time with Nita we didn't have good
[01:16:34] dendros either our best dendro was
[01:16:36] dendro main character I'm not kidding
[01:16:38] the best dendro support until Nita is
[01:16:41] dendro like was dendro MC which and
[01:16:43] dendro MC is fine my first impressions
[01:16:46] maybe I'll be completely wrong maybe
[01:16:48] when I fully build out Gan I'll be wrong
[01:16:51] but just be a little bit careful with D
[01:16:53] yeah DMC is still good by the way like
[01:16:55] don't feel bad using DMC but it's just
[01:16:56] like the upgrade to is pretty big until
[01:16:58] you're like further into the game
[01:17:00] especially I think if you've got a
[01:17:01] really tiny roster um there there's
[01:17:05] maybe better pickups the only issue is
[01:17:09] the only issue
[01:17:10] is you got 20 days to decide right you
[01:17:15] got 20 days to
[01:17:16] decide but who's making noises oh my
[01:17:20] sorry kirar I'm sorry for raising my
[01:17:22] voice cracked characters that I might
[01:17:24] recommend like kazua might not come
[01:17:27] until like June or July and so it's like
[01:17:31] if the C if the character looks
[01:17:34] fun use it abuser and I guess to
[01:17:38] quantify this as well is if I'm not
[01:17:40] hyping her up and like oh my God I
[01:17:43] cleared the abyss with her I got all the
[01:17:45] stars with her I tried her multiple
[01:17:47] teams she worked even if she was scuffed
[01:17:51] at like gamers
[01:17:54] okay wait wait a second listen I'm not
[01:17:58] an artifact judging Andy
[01:18:01] however you
[01:18:08] have that is a circlet I mean wait a
[01:18:12] second does she gains crit rate
[01:18:13] Ascension right
[01:18:16] so I mean I guess it's fine maybe I'm
[01:18:20] under I mean how much HP does he have
[01:18:22] Plus
[01:18:23] 20 ah yeah you have a lot of HP H that's
[01:18:27] fine it's fine it's fine however keep in
[01:18:29] mind it's tenacity the milth level 80 uh
[01:18:33] level five burst and burst is more
[01:18:35] important than skill by the way like
[01:18:36] burst is really good both are important
[01:18:38] but burst is really
[01:18:39] big she's terrible I could make her hit
[01:18:43] three or four times harder he
[01:18:45] acknowledges it though still cleared the
[01:18:47] OBS that good so the end of the day when
[01:18:51] it's all said and done
[01:18:54] who cares if my furina with 25% of her
[01:18:59] damage potential works then who cares
[01:19:02] get who you want pick who you want if
[01:19:04] they look fun do it I don't even know
[01:19:05] why I'm making this video I'm just going
[01:19:07] to shut up right
[01:19:08] now okay I mean honestly good thing
[01:19:11] honestly good thing I will say I don't
[01:19:13] like okay the only thing I don't like
[01:19:15] look I like how M at least feels like he
[01:19:17] genuinely just talks about what he feels
[01:19:19] the only thing I don't like like I don't
[01:19:21] mind the video the only thing I don't
[01:19:22] like is how it's a bit painted as like
[01:19:27] people are going to say she's
[01:19:29] broken because there you know they want
[01:19:31] to Hype it it's like listen listen I
[01:19:35] think she's really good I think she's
[01:19:37] really really good
[01:19:40] however your opinion is your opinion and
[01:19:42] that's cool I don't think there's some
[01:19:44] characters I don't think are as good as
[01:19:45] most people think right right every time
[01:19:48] I bring up sucros when people talk about
[01:19:50] other Animo five stars that they want to
[01:19:51] pull for they're like oh this I hate you
[01:19:54] so I I stay quiet I learned my lesson
[01:19:56] however four times harder and she's
[01:19:58] still
[01:20:00] however however no I think K is broken
[01:20:02] but that's not anyways you get my
[01:20:04] point
[01:20:05] however the only thing is that it's
[01:20:08] called like this and then it's like he's
[01:20:10] saying stuff like but it's just like
[01:20:13] it's painted as his opinion so it's fine
[01:20:14] like I don't mind the video this
[01:20:15] literally what I called it I literally
[01:20:17] okay I actually didn't call that it was
[01:20:19] mostly because of what his experience
[01:20:21] was on his freet to playay account but I
[01:20:22] out of that decent
[01:20:26] guess is the SRO era over hello also
[01:20:29] link the video people in welcome hi I'm
[01:20:32] not going to be react Andy today but I
[01:20:33] just want to I just want to see is the
[01:20:34] SRO era over can you tell me to my day
[01:20:37] one First Impressions on finina I was
[01:20:39] literally there we talked we literally
[01:20:41] called am I in this
[01:20:43] video no I'm not wor skill issue for Dam
[01:20:47] this guy's Skilling RI
[01:20:51] Bozo d
[01:20:54] this is the guy that wheezes when I take
[01:20:59] damage
[01:21:01] remember like the
[01:21:05] video I probably shouldn't have skipped
[01:21:07] the first part let me listen to him I'm
[01:21:08] sorry the future so if you want like
[01:21:11] more you know structured thoughts wait
[01:21:13] for the post-release analysis which
[01:21:16] hopefully will come out before the end
[01:21:18] Sor I'm impatience I'm feeling very very
[01:21:20] bad physically lately the uh the the
[01:21:23] rizzly pre-release ended up getting
[01:21:25] delayed until well now the banner is
[01:21:28] over I did make a community post
[01:21:29] summarizing my thoughts because I to get
[01:21:32] it out in time hopefully I I I I recover
[01:21:35] and I feel better enough to do the post-
[01:21:39] release but let's get into the first
[01:21:40] impressions so I've Ted her in a lot of
[01:21:42] teams in many of the teams she performed
[01:21:45] more or less as expected right in like
[01:21:48] pyro teams with Hut performs about as
[01:21:50] well as I expected I haven't tried
[01:21:53] double Hydro teams with other the [ __ ]
[01:21:55] is this emote in his chat can you guys
[01:21:57] see this what is this emote characters I
[01:21:59] did try solo Hydro with Yia and as much
[01:22:03] as it was doable I didn't really like it
[01:22:05] very much I think it's hard to fit a
[01:22:07] Healer and the way that her obligation
[01:22:09] work because it's not consistent the
[01:22:11] rate at which what the [ __ ] I'm not
[01:22:14] adding ABA because it's three different
[01:22:16] summons with three different attack
[01:22:17] speeds your hydro AA because your
[01:22:19] summons lined up in a way where they
[01:22:21] didn't attack a little bit and then get
[01:22:24] a power AA and then you start losing
[01:22:25] your Vapes on yo I've done a bit of
[01:22:27] testing on on solo Hydro Yia I don't
[01:22:28] like it very much I I really do think
[01:22:30] you want to stick to double hyro why is
[01:22:33] it work my is not working and overall I
[01:22:35] just don't know if I like finina in her
[01:22:38] specific teams all that much but it's at
[01:22:40] the very least it's all right I've tried
[01:22:42] with Shang Ling it feels good I don't
[01:22:45] think it's better than some of the other
[01:22:46] Hydro options though but it definitely
[01:22:48] does feel all right definitely an option
[01:22:50] if you're s so or you're or your child
[01:22:54] is busy I don't see but I you guys see I
[01:22:56] think you can use it with almost any of
[01:22:58] the animal units cuz you can just have
[01:23:01] benett be your healer and swap between
[01:23:02] all your characters I I did kind of like
[01:23:04] the version using Jee as the animal
[01:23:06] doing neul teams with her and without
[01:23:09] her and having played a lot of the net
[01:23:12] hyper Bloom team with DEA I don't know
[01:23:15] if I would be confident in saying that I
[01:23:17] significantly prefer the finina version
[01:23:20] okay but low key who the [ __ ] world
[01:23:23] is playing I'm sorry if this is your
[01:23:25] favorite team I'm sorry who is playing
[01:23:27] these okay hyper Bloom team with de I
[01:23:31] don't know if I would be confident in
[01:23:33] saying that I see finina version either
[01:23:37] of hyper blue or like taser or actually
[01:23:39] makes good which is cool something awes
[01:23:43] it's it's good definitely and it's
[01:23:45] competitive with those teams for sure
[01:23:47] but I don't think it's like on a whole
[01:23:48] other level in the same way that I kind
[01:23:50] of was expecting it to be I've tested
[01:23:52] ACH bunch of cry teams she feels all
[01:23:54] right but not the greatest especially
[01:23:55] because her Hydro op is kind of you
[01:23:57] can't really stop it once it's started
[01:23:59] which means that when you're against
[01:24:01] bosses it's really difficult to get a
[01:24:03] cryo swirl so it it hasn't felt the best
[01:24:06] I tried to H them in tet teams really

[01:37:20] listen I was thinking I was literally
[01:37:22] laying in bed and then it hit me I was
[01:37:24] literally laying in bed and it hit
[01:37:26] me what if I play a tanari team where
[01:37:31] normally I'd be like oh I could put
[01:37:33] yolan here but he doesn't want a normal
[01:37:34] attack so you can't really use yon so
[01:37:36] what if I played a tinari team with
[01:37:39] finina and then I damage buffed not just
[01:37:41] my finina but also my big ton and my
[01:37:49] EO think about it think about about it
[01:37:51] we have Quicken slow Hydro bonus hyper
[01:37:55] blooms the only question is oh who's
[01:37:57] hyper blooming yeah moo because you're
[01:37:59] spending some time on her so she can
[01:38:01] hyper Bloom you build her on some em
[01:38:03] actually could cook now you might be
[01:38:04] like why don't you just play [ __ ] em
[01:38:06] Ryden sure you can but [ __ ] you I want
[01:38:10] to play
[01:38:13] I think about it cuz your your onfield
[01:38:17] presence is Big T and Yi who both need
[01:38:19] only a little bit of time Fina press is
[01:38:20] EQ swap by you presses EQ
[01:38:26] swap official official would be bad here
[01:38:29] unless you unless you replace fin
[01:38:30] official sure but like in terms of like
[01:38:32] in terms of like in terms of like in
[01:38:34] terms of like in terms of like in terms
[01:38:36] of like with finina this seems pretty
[01:38:38] good you can also do Ryden or another
[01:38:40] like yeah Electro but Ryden is so I
[01:38:42] don't know I don't know I think dude I
[01:38:45] actually think I'm cooking but there's
[01:38:47] nowhere to test it right now energy gen
[01:38:49] mod check dude you you play [ __ ]
[01:38:52] baiju on protype Ember or fa you stack
[01:38:54] ER yeah you're your Y is going to need a
[01:38:57] million true actually everyone's going
[01:38:59] to need a million except Big T so fair
[01:39:02] however it is what it
[01:39:06] is dude it is what it is even if you
[01:39:08] play a Ryden you need to [ __ ] I mean
[01:39:10] Ryden R but you're not going to burst on
[01:39:13] Ryden also Y is y is
[01:39:20] chilling
[01:39:27] yeah I don't think he need a burst every
[01:39:28] rotation on Y in this team right you can
[01:39:30] just do it like whenever you have it
[01:39:31] like once every two I don't know if
[01:39:33] that's optimal but if you need a lot of
[01:39:34] er it probably
[01:39:37] is I would try it but the current Abyss
[01:39:40] is like dog poop for trying it well I'll
[01:39:41] try it still [ __ ]
[01:39:45] it do I have GE reactions they're coming
[01:39:47] out
[01:39:50] soon
[01:39:52] also I
[01:39:53] saw
[01:39:55] I I saw the great Twitter war once again
[01:40:00] of Z Jeff being like I think Nava's kit
[01:40:03] looks underwhelming but he didn't say
[01:40:04] kit in the Tweet so he said Navia then
[01:40:06] the [ __ ] Taylor Swift Navia fans are
[01:40:08] like oh he called my favorite character
[01:40:10] underwhelming and then got mad at him so
[01:40:13] that was uh
[01:40:16] fun dude okay respectfully obviously it
[01:40:19] left his target audience but you got to
[01:40:21] word your tweets carefully you you got
[01:40:23] to say kit cuz if you just say character
[01:40:26] like if you just say it and your
[01:40:27] audience knows what you're talking about
[01:40:29] but then it like yeah that's
[01:40:33] unfortunate uh genin simps are very
[01:40:39] dangerous that's why I don't [ __ ] with
[01:40:42] them uh the only people I do [ __ ] with
[01:40:45] is the people that still get mad when I
[01:40:47] say child's going to die [ __ ] you I

[01:40:50] out lives give it right a good death and

[02:01:58] you emerge right here emerge right here
[02:02:02] emerge right
[02:02:04] now
[02:02:06] flowers
[02:02:08] Haven
[02:02:13] yet not only am I annoyed that I
[02:02:17] died brilliant not only am I why am I on
[02:02:20] the Healer stance not only am I annoyed
[02:02:22] that I died I just remembered that the
[02:02:25] last time we streamed we single pulled
[02:02:27] and got BYU
[02:02:28] donut on no pity and now I remembered
[02:02:31] that I have B donut and I'm angry again
[02:02:34] right
[02:02:37] now how did the it's
[02:02:44] fine a bit to
[02:02:47] swallow
[02:02:50] I'm upset by the
[02:02:54] way well it's end her
[02:03:12] soon artifact
[02:03:17] artifact
[02:03:23] isn't 's damage a bit low I
[02:03:26] mean he's decent could be better I could
[02:03:29] put on MAR CH but also like I'm not like
[02:03:31] that was not I didn't even burst on
[02:03:32] finina
[02:03:34] there he's
[02:03:37] decent chat uh I think it might actually
[02:03:41] be a good time while I still have energy
[02:03:43] what if we did a little bit more uid
[02:03:45] reviews not cuz I need to not cuz I
[02:03:48] particularly want to I mean I'm down but
[02:03:50] also cuz I have to leave for like 2 days
[02:03:51] which isn't a long time but I have to go
[02:03:53] to chel quickly tomorrow so I might as
[02:03:54] well do content now which actually is a
[02:03:56] good idea and then after that we can
[02:03:57] spend resin maybe I should spend resin
[02:03:59] first cuz I'm
[02:04:02] capped oh I said I would do Asia server
[02:04:04] true but if I log into my free playay
[02:04:06] account the [ __ ] a [ __ ] this is the
[02:04:09] only downside of swapping I will do I'm
[02:04:11] fine I said I'd do Asia so I will the
[02:04:13] only problem is if I go to my Asia
[02:04:15] account my I'll get the [ __ ] welcome

[02:09:56] Stellar we did it chat I said I was
[02:10:00] going to play this account again I log I
[02:10:02] I said that then when I log back in
[02:10:04] guess what Stellar
[02:10:07] reunion has anyone else ever came here
[02:10:09] and then be like [ __ ] I want to fight
[02:10:10] the oceanid and then you log out and you
[02:10:12] just stop playing for a bit cuz that's
[02:10:14] what happened and it happen I feel like
[02:10:15] I've logged out here many times dude I
[02:10:19] hate this boss man I [ __ ] hate this
[02:10:24] boss what did C message me
[02:10:47] balls
[02:11:13] where's my
[02:11:17] key
[02:11:30] [Music]
[02:11:31] he got pranked all right chat I think
[02:11:33] it's
[02:11:38] time let me time stamp this if I make it
[02:11:40] into video 2 hours 11 of the stream um
[02:11:45] to 11 don't stop typing chats stop I
[02:11:48] have to do the intro first you guys are
[02:11:49] are wasting your breath what the flip is
[02:11:52] this icon is that Stellar
[02:12:02] reunion dude I literally okay chat I
[02:12:05] just want to be honest with you guys I
[02:12:06] said I was going to start playing this
[02:12:07] account again and then it's been so long
[02:12:09] that I had Stell reunion back then and
[02:12:12] then I got it again I don't know what to
[02:12:14] do um I don't know why my ping is 320
[02:12:17] but I think it would be really funny if
[02:12:19] I played on this account again now every
[02:12:21] time I say I'm going to play on this
[02:12:22] account I end up not playing on this
[02:12:26] account
[02:12:29] so at this point what if we made a new
[02:12:31] account however this account is funny
[02:12:34] because first of all I've reviewed this
[02:12:36] multiple times but we haven't played on
[02:12:38] it in Forever it's a super funny account
[02:12:40] where ar45 and our shs kind of cracked
[02:12:42] just saying but what's especially pogers
[02:12:45] about it is we have an R2 festering
[02:12:47] desire that's how how old it is okay and
[02:12:49] yet it's neglected but not only could we
[02:12:52] turn it around we could also currently
[02:12:55] get finina because that's the dude
[02:12:57] listen I could use festering on her
[02:13:01] think about it think about
[02:13:06] it imagine if we got finina where did
[02:13:09] that come
[02:13:13] from look our yes our thing is only R2
[02:13:16] but listen I had a life back then I
[02:13:19] touched
[02:13:24] grass we'll do one
[02:13:27] Temple because B's also good and shot is
[02:13:30] also good I
[02:13:35] dude you don't have a Healer for finina
[02:13:37] yeah we
[02:13:46] do
[02:13:48] um we have
[02:13:53] Barbara we have
[02:13:56] uh we have
[02:14:01] Barbara we have
[02:14:03] Barbara we could get Charlotte if we
[02:14:06] pull for freom we'll probably get
[02:14:16] charlot
[02:14:26] wait chat what's better
[02:14:28] content fixing this account dude cuz if
[02:14:30] I make this into a video it could be
[02:14:32] like fixing the most scuffed account cuz
[02:14:33] it is but then you won't know it's my
[02:14:35] account until you're watching it and
[02:14:36] then like you don't know at the start
[02:14:39] think about it but we can also make a
[02:14:41] new
[02:14:45] account pull okay but pulling doesn't
[02:14:47] fix
[02:14:50] anything okay what if we just do one
[02:14:51] temple one Temple never heard anyone
[02:14:53] true it objectively speaking one Temple
[02:14:55] never hurt
[02:14:58] okay okay please don't hurt me please
[02:15:00] don't hurt me I haven't pulled on this
[02:15:02] account in years do you guys want to see
[02:15:03] what the last Temple I did was I'll show
[02:15:11] you yay Cole we could play her with
[02:15:15] kaching she's actually
[02:15:20] King oh wow that is a bad tle
[02:15:26] though our last Temple was
[02:15:32] 20236 that is five months
[02:15:38] ago what about before that oh there's no
[02:15:41] more permanent oh we did
[02:15:45] one I don't know what my pity is
[02:16:08] yeah I don't know if I'd even play
[02:16:10] finina chat I'm going to be honest I
[02:16:12] love her I [ __ ] love finina but if
[02:16:13] this account got finina where would we
[02:16:15] use her so we'd have a oh maybe a shot
[02:16:17] no but
[02:16:18] Bennett no we could play finina with
[02:16:21] like E I mean we could finina
[02:16:30] SRO I'm not building
[02:16:33] no I don't want to build Noel she is
[02:16:46] c0o
[02:16:50] I could play no okay let's say I get it
[02:16:52] right finina
[02:16:57] Barbara I don't have
[02:17:03] offishal B but then
[02:17:08] sucros wouldn't sug SRO just be
[02:17:12] better I could play on the sh team but
[02:17:14] my only healer would be
[02:17:16] Bennett oh Bennett and protype Amber
[02:17:20] sucrose no but I want to use my caes
[02:17:23] farzon I think it'd be funny okay I
[02:17:25] actually don't know what the play is I
[02:17:27] need an Nemo healer I literally need Gan
[02:17:29] or saou like saou would actually be good
[02:17:31] but I don't have okay finina doesn't
[02:17:33] actually do much on this account I'm not
[02:17:34] going to lie Fin's busted but like I
[02:17:36] don't even know what I could build here
[02:17:38] Mt was right
[02:17:44] aware yeah if I get Charlotte if I get
[02:17:46] Charlotte she's a good good healer
[02:17:48] Barbara could work but I don't know if I
[02:17:50] want a double Hydro with Barbara being
[02:17:52] the other Hydro here cuz it's kind of
[02:17:53] weird like I don't have like a Kaza I
[02:17:55] don't have like I could play taser but I
[02:17:57] would assume that SRO sucros would be
[02:18:00] more DPS than finina Barbara could be
[02:18:03] wrong but you also get the double swirl
[02:18:06] Electro
[02:18:09] so if you ever want to trade tactics I'm
[02:18:12] always
[02:18:16] ready
[02:18:24] I'm going to do a single
[02:18:27] pull [ __ ] is this what it's like playing
[02:18:29] on 300
[02:18:31] ping okay okay if it's shot we might get
[02:18:35] fre enough okay I mean that's good
[02:18:38] that's fine I
[02:18:42] mean it's it's five fa is

[02:18:54] okay that is a Charlotte weapon
[02:19:15] true on field ooh

[02:20:47] Max
[02:20:48] stamina it's fine I don't think we need
[02:20:51] to pull yet I don't think we need to
[02:20:52] pull yet maybe we could do it later when
[02:20:56] we start playing this account again cuz
[02:20:57] I don't want to like pretend I'm going
[02:20:58] to play the account and then not play it
[02:20:59] I need to start playing it when I say I
[02:21:01] start playing it does that make
[02:21:05] sense wait however what if this is the
[02:21:08] day it starts so that when I'm not home
[02:21:11] I could play secretly on my phone could
[02:21:13] you imagine if I secretly fix this
[02:21:15] account off stream and then when I
[02:21:16] stream you guys like what the [ __ ] how
[02:21:18] do you actually have artifacts now could
[02:21:20] you imagine cuz cuz dude there's no way
[02:21:22] I'm going to play this account like 3
[02:21:23] hours a day on stream I don't have time
[02:21:25] for that on top of the other stuff I do
[02:21:27] right so what if I do it off stream but
[02:21:29] it's like I don't want to do it off
[02:21:30] stream because I feel like that's a
[02:21:31] waste of content so I'm in a weird
[02:21:34] content Loop like like the yeah the
[02:21:36] samsara Loop where it's like beep and
[02:21:38] then you wake up and it's like I don't
[02:21:39] know if I want to play on stream or off
[02:21:45] stream chat listen listen sha right

[02:22:42] farzon player again I want to know what
[02:22:45] it's like to have to play a 300 ER fars

[02:22:51] now uh we also have SRO again c0 but C2
[02:22:54] bet well three but two is huge so we
[02:22:57] could do bet teams when I was initially
[02:22:59] planning on playing this account again
[02:23:00] for the first time the teams we planned
[02:23:02] on making were a Shia team Shia farzon
[02:23:05] sucros Bennett and a taser team beta
[02:23:08] official SRO sucros no I just said

[02:23:43] decided on BET SRO fishal
[02:23:48] something we definitely played that it
[02:23:50] might have been
[02:23:52] sucros and then the first half was Shia
[02:23:56] Faron Animo MC Bennett yes sir tell me

[02:38:36] means this amount of five stars is
[02:38:38] realistic like it could you know if they
[02:38:40] play for that long could happen 678 I
[02:38:41] don't know why you level your normals
[02:38:43] but cool um golden troop that's that's
[02:38:45] pretty
[02:38:47] good pretty good only bad roll is attack

[02:38:51] roll I like it Sans not bad it's okay
[02:38:54] it's okay it's not amazing but it's a
[02:38:55] new set I it's not bad it's about as

[02:39:44] good
[02:39:48] a loved an actual loved unbench Soo

[02:39:54] shot at me my Soo isn't benched second
[02:39:56] of all if you loved him you would clear
[02:39:58] past A3 with him third of
[02:40:01] all Jade spear that's actually not bad
[02:40:04] Jade spear is fine um I was going to
[02:40:05] point out your low em but with a high
[02:40:07] Bas attack weapon like Jade spear attack
[02:40:09] send is more viable it's not always the
[02:40:11] best but it's more viable so let's look
[02:40:14] four Guild of Dreams
[02:40:17] as a Soo player myself I like thundering
[02:40:19] Fury a lot but gilded is f is is viable

[02:40:25] okay really good that's good that's nice
[02:40:28] 32 crit damage an ER roll and an em roll

[02:50:12] on Triple Em which is good but then you
[02:50:14] have a bunch of crit sub stats for some
[02:50:16] reason but you have a lot of ER on your
[02:50:17] Skyward blade like listen you have some
[02:50:21] Er you have a decent amount of em it's
[02:50:23] fine but like imagine if instead of
[02:50:26] having a tiny bit of crit this was
[02:50:28] converted into more em and more
[02:50:32] ER C2
[02:50:34] though pretty pretty
[02:50:36] good but
[02:50:41] yeah where my
[02:50:43] official okay
[02:50:47] visual uh again over 1,000 achievements
[02:50:50] that's going to be me this patch true
[02:50:52] Lev W uh Scout heart official only level
[02:50:55] 80 matter of fact if you're not 90 you
[02:50:58] don't love the character enough we're
[02:50:59] doing someone else uh we'll do your sh
[02:51:01] [ __ ] it hom yeah you didn't expect your
[02:51:04] what the [ __ ] is this why is everything
[02:51:06] red I mean it's fine but it just looks
[02:51:08] weird uh that's good
[02:51:11] that I'm upset not because this is bad
[02:51:14] because you saved your sanity skipped
[02:51:17] the Vermilion domain said hey I have
[02:51:18] good enough substats on the pieces I
[02:51:20] already farmed I'm just going to put
[02:51:21] them on TR and honestly you've probably
[02:51:24] saved months if not years of Sanity that
[02:51:27] I have lost so
[02:51:29] congratulations on your show
[02:51:31] congratulations
[02:51:36] congratulations next
[02:51:43] shot okay
[02:51:45] I'm going to highlight this one in
[02:51:46] particular because they
[02:51:49] said redeem their message highlight
[02:51:51] message my alham is better than yours no
[02:51:56] cope but they misspelled
[02:52:00] alham why do I doubt that your Al is
[02:52:02] better than mine let's just
[02:52:06] look had collector I like
[02:52:10] them light F incision best in slot c0
[02:52:15] Crown skill now with light of folio
[02:52:17] incision it is hard to have enough crit
[02:52:19] rate because you get so much crit damage
[02:52:21] that even if you have crit rate cir it
[02:52:22] you might still have like two over 200
[02:52:25] crit damage but only like 60 70 crit
[02:52:27] rate let's look
[02:52:31] flower never mind this guy is just this
[02:52:35] guy is just the best we found the
[02:52:36] [ __ ] crit rate CEO I'm sorry I take
[02:52:39] back everything I said does your feather
[02:52:41] follow
[02:52:42] up this is a really good feather less
[02:52:45] crit rate but still really good
[02:52:47] Sans pretty good as
[02:52:49] well goblet on set by the way if this is
[02:52:52] the onset dad
[02:52:59] goblet I'm going to vine boom that I'm
[02:53:02] going to vine boom that again it's okay
[02:53:04] a lot of er decent amount of crit on set
[02:53:06] actually uh pretty good um it would be
[02:53:09] even better if you could use the
[02:53:12] HP but it's pretty good actually decent
[02:53:15] this pretty decent um
[02:53:20] ciret okay I'm going to I'm going to
[02:53:22] talk for a second I think if you have a
[02:53:24] crit rate circuit and it has crit like
[02:53:26] 20 crit damage or more it's already
[02:53:28] pretty good like that's good you have 20
[02:53:30] crit damage and 5.8 attack which is good
[02:53:34] and then you have 84
[02:53:37] em wait this is crap we actually found
[02:53:40] the goat that's good your ER is a bit
[02:53:42] low though but uh 8022 20 damn fm2 this
[02:53:46] a good you know what I take back what I

[03:05:11] hell feather
[03:05:13] that's also good
[03:05:15] Sans dude is this what my account would
[03:05:17] look like if I kept farming emblem I ask
[03:05:19] this every time every time I see someone
[03:05:21] with good emblem I feel like this could
[03:05:22] be me in like a different timeline if
[03:05:25] Doctor Strange saw all the timelines
[03:05:27] there's at least one what I'm sayane and
[03:05:29] an emblem this circle is kind of I mean

[03:05:42] value
[03:05:51] nice wait Chad did you guys
[03:05:54] see someone chat asked why are we only
[03:05:56] doing Asia uh reviews today but that
[03:05:58] reminded me do you guys see uh what
[03:06:00] charlot does do you guys see her passive
[03:06:03] okay is this not okay correct me if I'm
[03:06:05] wrong please but is this not the first
[03:06:07] racist passive we got in genin this is
[03:06:10] concerning when party contains one 2 3
[03:06:13] fontans other than herself gain healing
[03:06:16] bonus when the party gains non fontans
[03:06:18] hey get [ __ ] stupid crowd damage on
[03:06:20] my skill that does no damage anyways
[03:06:22] that is
[03:06:24] concerning first the lithic spear now
[03:06:27] the Diversified
[03:06:37] investigation
[03:06:40] concerning all right next IDE
[03:07:07] all right next
[03:07:11] JY yeah y Miko all right let's look at
[03:07:14] your I like y
[03:07:17] Miko let's look at it level 90 y Miko
[03:07:20] only why do you only have 77
[03:07:22] Em I'm going to assume you play her in
[03:07:24] non- dendro teams but if you are playing
[03:07:27] her in dendro em is quite nice
[03:07:29] especially with they're passive but
[03:07:30] maybe you have good sub stats on your
[03:07:31] attack Sands that's okay whith two piece
[03:07:35] twopiece attack
[03:07:38] sets
[03:07:39] a1010 see1 this is basically what I
[03:07:42] would recommend B before dendro came out
[03:07:44] where y you could kind of go based on
[03:07:46] sub stats mix and match two pieces then
[03:07:48] we got gilded dreams dendro reactions
[03:07:50] and also golden troop but you know uh
[03:07:54] still fine that's an insane feather I
[03:07:56] mean FL that's an insane
[03:08:00] flower okay maybe I spoke too soon okay
[03:08:06] maybe yeah this is crack uh look I'll be
[03:08:09] honest sub stats for y on 2b2 be are
[03:08:12] really good obviously there's some
[03:08:14] better sets you could go but this is
[03:08:16] still cracked only thing is if you're
[03:08:18] aggravating and maybe even hyper bloing
[03:08:19] as well like occasionally depending on
[03:08:21] your team having more em like an em
[03:08:23] sense could be nice but going based on
[03:08:25] sub stats is good and your sub stats are
[03:08:26] pretty cracked uh why is your cir did we
[03:08:31] just find a ciret that has exactly the
[03:08:33] same amount of crit rate as crit damage
[03:08:35] this is a one toone
[03:08:37] ciret I don't know if I've seen this
[03:08:42] before
[03:08:44] good y your em your ER is really low um
[03:08:48] 90 energy cause burst by the
[03:08:50] way but if you're just using her for her
[03:08:53] skill
[03:08:55] um then use Golden true but really good
[03:08:58] the crit in value really good uh you
[03:09:00] could optimize em and er a bit more
[03:09:01] though but
[03:09:05] yeah bursting every three
[03:09:11] rotations
[03:09:27] bro scared to look at my ning Wong I
[03:09:29] don't know why but I am not afraid to
[03:09:31] look at your ning why would I be afraid
[03:09:33] to look at your n in fact I enjoy
[03:09:35] looking at ning Wong respectfully
[03:09:36] respectfully of course why would I not
[03:09:38] want to look whoa what the [ __ ] I have
[03:09:41] not seen this weapon on her granted I
[03:09:43] actually think with finina this weapon
[03:09:44] becomes really good in a lot of
[03:09:45] characters because as your HP increases
[03:09:47] or decreases and finina can do that you
[03:09:49] gain charge attack damage ning Wong can
[03:09:51] also charge attack especially with her
[03:09:52] C6 which you have Triple Crown I respect
[03:09:56] it so far to no blast too glad because
[03:09:57] ning Wong still doesn't have a set for
[03:09:58] some [ __ ] reason never mind I just
[03:10:00] remembered Mari chose holy [ __ ] ning
[03:10:02] Wong just got buffed with finina and I
[03:10:03] didn't even notice wait a second can't
[03:10:05] you go Mari chose ning Wong with frina
[03:10:08] wait I want to try this can you guys let
[03:10:09] me cook after
[03:10:11] this
[03:10:13] dude finina dude finina literally
[03:10:15] decided to just show up and buff like
[03:10:18] 90% of characters anyways uh good
[03:10:21] twopiece twopiece flower pretty decent
[03:10:25] feather pretty good
[03:10:27] set so far so
[03:10:30] good goblet don't let me down if your
[03:10:32] goblet lets me down I'm ending stream
[03:10:35] okay that's pretty good Dam uh this is
[03:10:38] probably your weakest piece but still
[03:10:39] overall really good um yeah really good
[03:10:44] I like this Nong
[03:10:46] Jesus what the
[03:10:50] hell um cracked uh right now em on Gio
[03:10:53] is pretty bad because crystallize
[03:10:55] stronger Shields with em who cares but
[03:10:57] when we get the future Geo region right
[03:11:00] with the new Geo archon the new reaction
[03:11:03] cement is going to scale on your em so
[03:11:05] let's just say you might want to some em
[03:11:07] for ning Wong later for Now crystalize
[03:11:09] sucks don't want em good build let's
[03:11:11] just say maybe not true by the way don't
[03:11:14] don't preform me but it'd be funny if
[03:11:16] you needed
[03:11:23] it new viewer ra by Hut okay if you're a
[03:11:27] new viewer and this this is even the
[03:11:28] right
[03:11:31] server I'm
[03:11:35] sorry sorry we're doing Asia right now
[03:11:37] we did na before now we're doing Asia we
[03:11:38] we alternate servers
[03:11:41] usually
[03:11:43] but welcome to the stream I hope you're
[03:11:44] you're having
[03:11:46] a r my coomi I can but look wait I
[03:11:50] already did I not already review
[03:11:52] you no I
[03:11:55] haven't I can't but dude look at kakomi
[03:11:57] STS are weird cuz it's like it's like HP
[03:12:00] like er like em you have a donut why the
[03:12:05] [ __ ] do you have a
[03:12:10] donut wait
[03:12:13] you dude
[03:12:15] I you have an
[03:12:19] art let's just look at KI first of all
[03:12:22] even kakomi Mains and enjoyers like
[03:12:24] myself know that kakomi can use
[03:12:25] thrilling tals because she doesn't
[03:12:26] submit to consumerism and doesn't need
[03:12:28] her signature which is a waste of Primo
[03:12:31] gems with that in mind it looks cool so
[03:12:33] pretty uh for
[03:12:35] deepwood okay I mean that's fine in a
[03:12:38] dendra team uh 75 em wait what the [ __ ]
[03:12:42] are are you
[03:12:44] doing what is the okay respectfully I
[03:12:47] haven't really roasted any builds we're
[03:12:49] about to roast a build what the [ __ ] is
[03:12:51] this look if you're playing her with nuu
[03:12:53] put your [ __ ] put your other random
[03:12:55] ass cringe Dental character on deepwood
[03:12:58] and give your C ccom me the EM she
[03:12:59] deserves with guilded dreams or flower
[03:13:01] of paradise lost or twopiece em twopiece
[03:13:04] em why is she the [ __ ] deepwood user
[03:13:06] who's also on em but for some [ __ ]
[03:13:08] reason on ER as well do you need the
[03:13:11] [ __ ] burst to heal your part know you
[03:13:15] don't deepwood is fine in other teams
[03:13:17] though but if you're stacking em you
[03:13:19] probably want her to be ungilded
[03:13:22] um respectfully Triple Crown though you
[03:13:25] probably want to use her on field which
[03:13:27] is why you're doing that I respect it
[03:13:29] with aesthetic fair
[03:13:32] fair uh but also not fair why did I say
[03:13:40] fair I don't know what this is for like
[03:13:43] deepwood I mean if you didn't have em I
[03:13:46] would think this like standard support
[03:13:47] for dender team and it would be good but
[03:13:48] you have 515 em so makes me think it's a
[03:13:50] Neu let's just review I'm going to have
[03:13:52] a headache let's review Hut she's simple
[03:13:55] wow that's actually insane see this is a
[03:13:57] lot this is a lot more fun see now
[03:13:59] everyone's having a good time amazing
[03:14:01] goblet on set this is a good why do you
[03:14:04] have 20

[03:14:11] want to talk right now
[03:14:13] that was an insane goblet
[03:14:22] though DPS

[03:14:33] sheny Calamity quor
[03:14:37] okay four bzro
[03:14:40] okay C2 okay triple Crow also her normal
[03:14:44] attacks are crowned which is definitely
[03:14:46] a decision of all time really good
[03:14:47] flower all the subsets are good pretty
[03:14:50] [ __ ] good feather too because a lot
[03:14:52] of attack for Shena is very good wow
[03:14:55] wait a second wait a second this is
[03:14:57] pretty
[03:14:58] good this almost reminds me of the
[03:15:01] legendary Zio artifact but obviously
[03:15:03] it's not as good
[03:15:08] uh zok try not to mention the same one
[03:15:11] piece every time challenge impossible
[03:15:13] difficulty I'm pulling it up
[03:15:16] again hm almost as good as the piece I
[03:15:18] got uh uh over two years ago well not
[03:15:22] over but about two years ago let's look
[03:15:24] at
[03:15:26] it dude do you guys realize by the way
[03:15:28] sorry for the detour do you guys know
[03:15:30] how good my Shia was before Shia came
[03:15:31] out his ratio is was the same then as it
[03:15:34] is now but now I have to use Vermilion
[03:15:37] anyways hey what's going on guys Z here
[03:15:39] uh we're just going to do an a a bug
[03:15:41] abuse right now so there there's
[03:15:42] basically if you stand next to Xiao
[03:15:44] who's my husband uh there's a way to
[03:15:46] get good role on an artifact so what you
[03:15:48] want to do is you want to get an
[03:15:49] artifact with good stats ideally crit
[03:15:51] damage and crit rate and you put a plus
[03:15:53] 20 in next to sh right so if you do that
[03:15:56] actually let's let's put more than just
[03:15:57] that if you put uh all this stuff in
[03:15:59] here you're actually guaranteed to get
[03:16:01] only crit uh damage and crit rate
[03:16:03] upgrades so watch
[03:16:05] this
[03:16:09] oh we did

[03:17:56] Sky Pride gives you ER which is nice
[03:17:58] because now you have a good crit
[03:17:59] investment and a lot of ER and a decent
[03:18:02] amount of attack I like this bet crown

[03:18:36] uh for Mari okay uh you entered the
[03:18:39] [ __ ] Nim's dream domain or you got it
[03:18:42] from an artifact uh like the box that
[03:18:44] you get when you clear the abyss that's
[03:18:46] how I got a good piece so maybe benefit
[03:18:48] of the doubt
[03:18:52] unless okay it looks fine never mind
[03:18:55] okay I'll give you the benefit of the
[03:18:56] doubt why is your King on for glad never
[03:18:58] mind we are reviewing kaching iron sting
[03:19:02] that's good I mean what these are good
[03:19:04] but why are you on
[03:19:07] glad I have to
[03:19:09] sneeze bless you thanks no problem let's
[03:19:11] keep never let uh format I should say
[03:19:13] flower that's really good feather also
[03:19:16] really good what the [ __ ]
[03:19:26] this this domain just came out I have
[03:19:30] played since 1.0 September 2020 I only
[03:19:34] have one piece with 40 crit damage in
[03:19:39] three years playing G impact you have
[03:19:41] one on the brand new set I'm gonna I'm
[03:19:44] gonna say a word right now
[03:19:47] freck I'm sorry I'm sorry I went too far
[03:19:50] I'm sorry let's look at your
[03:19:57] goblet yo I'm sorry I'm sorry no no it's
[03:20:00] it's hard it's a struggle to get a good
[03:20:01] goblet I know I know I'm I'm not
[03:20:04] laughing at you I'm laughing with
[03:20:07] you how do you go from this to this keep
[03:20:10] farming you'll get a good a goblin
[03:20:12] honestly deserve for having a piece that
[03:20:14] fuels me with rage like this one but why
[03:20:16] be negative when you can be positive in
[03:20:18] life you got to see the bright side to
[03:20:20] get to the brighter side
[03:20:23] true I like it um also your circuit is
[03:20:25] really good but you might so if you get
[03:20:27] a good Hydro goblet on set boom upgrade
[03:20:29] if you get a good onset circlet boom
[03:20:31] upgrade then offset Hydro goblet which
[03:20:33] you probably have one example yeah I
[03:20:35] mean that's pretty good so uh let's look
[03:20:37] at your neetto to of Eternal flow c0o
[03:20:40] crown on the normal tax
[03:20:42] very nice ratio um 34k HP uh you get
[03:20:47] some crit with n really good I like it
[03:20:49] how much ER 112 I mean oh you have to
[03:20:53] that's fine
[03:20:54] yeah uh do keep in mind that HP circlet
[03:20:57] is also viable I think this is important
[03:20:59] to mention now because um well your crit
[03:21:02] rate is really low so you want the crit
[03:21:03] rate but if you ever have like a ton of
[03:21:06] crit damage low HP and maybe you don't
[03:21:08] have a good crit like circlet it's
[03:21:10] always viable to go HP and for good sub
[03:21:12] stats but you need the crit rate a lot
[03:21:14] so it's fine nice really good really
[03:21:16] good really
[03:21:29] good yugu feels dank man what the the
[03:21:33] [ __ ] does that mean you
[03:21:35] UE let's

[03:22:23] four
[03:22:25] damage however uu is arguably the best
[03:22:29] part of not just Yao Yao's kit but most
[03:22:32] characters kits so I respect it and I
[03:22:35] respect
[03:22:36] it but I don't know what I'm looking at

[03:29:03] will give you EXT Standing
[03:29:08] Ovation yeah that's really good no crit
[03:29:11] weapon for this ratio by the way this is
[03:29:13] pretty insane yeah amos's actually okay
[03:29:16] no ammo slander because it is good just
[03:29:19] in general I just like laughing about it
[03:29:20] because they they released other bows
[03:29:22] that are like more flexible because Amos
[03:29:23] is only good on like two characters but
[03:29:24] anyways uh your ratio is really high
[03:29:27] crit investment and EM so having an
[03:29:29] attack bow actually helps you out which
[03:29:31] is
[03:29:33] nice nice that's actually
[03:29:38] that's we
[03:29:40] good
[03:29:41] that's actually a good note to end on
[03:29:44] but before we do one more chat [ __ ] it
[03:29:46] what's the words that could happen one
[03:29:47] more what's the words that going happen
[03:29:48] one more someone just wrote a uid with
[03:29:50] nothing else [ __ ] it I'm a Gambling Man
[03:29:52] let's see let's just see literally
[03:29:55] nothing their name is male impact what
[03:29:57] does that even mean why is your name
[03:29:59] male impact you know what let's look at
[03:30:01] them har this is actually not bad if you
[03:30:04] have a shield so harer of dawn sure uh
[03:30:06] guilded dreams sure really wait a second
[03:30:10] maybe I judge too soon I wasn't familiar
[03:30:12] with your game this is really
[03:30:14] good I wasn't familiar with your game oh
[03:30:18] my oh
[03:30:21] my okay this 900 HP but other than that
[03:30:26] this is pretty insane triple crown on
[03:30:29] haringer which is really good if you can
[03:30:31] keep your HP high which means you want
[03:30:33] to be running a shielder like jongi with
[03:30:35] your Ali them or another shielder even
[03:30:36] kurara could work um this is good
[03:30:40] assuming that's not factoring in your
[03:30:42] crit passive from Harbinger which you'll
[03:30:44] get plus 208 crit rate on field really
[03:30:46] [ __ ] good uh Hy them yeah 130 ER
[03:30:50] depending on your team could be enough
[03:30:51] could be not enough but uh yeah no good
[03:30:59] build run him with ya ya and cookie well
[03:31:02] the thing is if you're just running
[03:31:03] healers and no Shield you can't really
[03:31:05] swap out of ala mid rotation right
[03:31:07] because you want to keep your mirrors up
[03:31:08] and you do like a longer rotation um so
[03:31:11] so even if you have enough healing if
[03:31:13] you're getting hit you lose your crit
[03:31:14] rate and then it's like it wait you have
[03:31:16] to wait till the tick that you get
[03:31:17] healed and you might get hit again and
[03:31:18] it makes Harbinger worse so like yeah it
[03:31:20] could work but typically you'd want a
[03:31:22] shield with
[03:31:26] Harbinger or you would want to be an off
[03:31:28] field
[03:31:32] character
[03:31:37] yeah um I honestly dude I honestly think
[03:31:40] that's a good note to end
[03:31:44] on I don't want to cuck you like I don't
[03:31:46] want to okay I I don't want to like okay
[03:31:48] I'll do I'll just do one random in chat
[03:31:51] that what okay ka's breasts just wrote
[03:31:54] the uide and wrote Kaa I'm gon to look
[03:31:57] at one piece if this
[03:32:00] isn't why is this good why is ka's why

[03:32:20] hyperventilating okay this Kai is
[03:32:21] actually insane triple crown with child
[03:32:25] in the team to make it look and C6 Kai
[03:32:28] which is rarer than some [ __ ] five
[03:32:30] star constellations by the way two piece
[03:32:32] two piece insane substats on every piece
[03:32:35] this is I respect this Kaa honestly even
[03:32:38] dish would be impressed I think

[03:36:26] [ __ ] wfu SS that swap [ __ ] waiu
[03:36:28] characters they like every two patches
[03:36:30] oh my God I love this new way no okay we
[03:36:33] like we've been loyal to to kakomi and
[03:36:36] finina is the second coming of our Hydra
[03:36:38] archon we have to gear both of them
[03:37:00] bro that could be good no
[03:37:09] unlucky please do normal attack sh team
[03:37:12] uh I'm
[03:37:13] good I'm
[03:37:26] okay disappear Opa six ads I literally
[03:37:30] don't even run ads so that's impossible
[03:37:32] you might get an ad when you enter
[03:37:34] stream because there's pre-rolls uh
[03:37:36] which is a twitch thing but I did not
[03:37:38] take so uh fun fact as a streamer you
[03:37:41] can get a lot of money if you decide to
[03:37:43] take a uh contract where you run ads
[03:37:46] every hour I don't do that if anything
[03:37:49] I'll do sponsor streams here and there
[03:37:50] cuz that's pretty cool but I don't run
[03:37:52] ads uh the only time I will run an ad is
[03:37:55] you might get it when you first run the
[03:37:56] stream or uh if someone redeems run an
[03:37:59] ad with Channel points but yeah usually
[03:38:02] I
[03:38:08] don't why free money I mean yeah but
[03:38:11] like I don't know I hate ads so why
[03:38:12] would I make you guys watch ads maybe
[03:38:14] like I don't I don't know maybe
[03:38:15] eventually but I don't want to I don't
[03:38:17] need it like I like I'm not like I don't
[03:38:19] know I do this for fun it is what it is
[03:38:21] but like also the way I view it is like
[03:38:23] if I okay so I enjoy doing sponsor
[03:38:25] streams cuz they're fun and I get to try
[03:38:26] a new game or do whatever with friends
[03:38:28] or whatever or whatever it is right and
[03:38:30] like that is cool and it
[03:38:32] usually would be like doing that like
[03:38:35] once every however often I do it is like
[03:38:38] the equivalent as of if I were to run
[03:38:40] ads but I don't have to run ads and I
[03:38:43] [ __ ] hate like as a viewer I hate
[03:38:45] watching ads I hate it I [ __ ] hate
[03:38:47] watching ads I hate ads so it's like
[03:38:50] yeah like there's some on YouTube
[03:38:52] obviously but like if I don't have to
[03:38:53] put on Twitch I won't this looks insane
[03:38:54] by the way this could be really
[03:38:57] good I'm being ignored what
[03:39:04] happened however I have to say this just
[03:39:08] so people know cuz people typing
[03:39:09] gigachad
[03:39:10] I don't anyone okay I think I like
[03:39:15] twitch the only thing I want to say
[03:39:17] that's kind of like like that I think
[03:39:19] they that is very bad that they did is
[03:39:22] they were like like there's a new thing
[03:39:24] where like you can get partner plus if
[03:39:26] you have subs or whatever and like it'll
[03:39:28] 7030 Revenue split which is really good
[03:39:31] but like outside of that they made it to
[03:39:33] where you're always getting 50% Subs
[03:39:35] instead of
[03:39:36] 70 and then they would like so then you
[03:39:39] get less from that but then they would
[03:39:40] boost the [ __ ] money you make from
[03:39:41] ads so they like force all the streamers
[03:39:44] especially like smaller or mediumsized
[03:39:45] streamers that are trying to like make a
[03:39:48] bit of money for their hard work have to
[03:39:50] run ads to like get anything which is
[03:39:52] like unfortunate which is why like I
[03:39:54] don't blame people for running ads cuz
[03:39:56] it it doesn't make sense not to I don't
[03:39:58] cuz I don't but like usually
[03:40:06] yeah can you the 30 seconds an
[03:40:09] hour I don't know maybe but then you get
[03:40:12] way
[03:40:14] less anyway someone redeemed running out
[03:40:16] with ch points so everything I said out
[03:40:18] the
[03:40:19] window rip booso see you guys in 30
[03:40:24] seconds yeah riposo now what now what
[03:40:27] get [ __ ]
[03:40:38] added d dude I still can't see Adoba can
[03:40:41] you guys see it I literally still
[03:40:43] can't I just refreshed my chat and I I
[03:40:47] don't think I can see yeah I can't see
[03:40:48] it now never mind I see it dude this
[03:40:50] emote is so ugly what the
[03:40:52] [ __ ] who let this happen who let bro
[03:40:57] cook
[03:41:03] evil is the worst emote but I kind of
[03:41:06] like
[03:41:09] it
[03:41:11] what does it even mean what is the point
[03:41:13] of
[03:41:14] Adoba is it that like Photoshop like
[03:41:17] premere
[03:41:26] Pro
[03:41:33] Adoba
[03:41:39] here it's Adoba you buffoon D I don't
[03:41:42] know what that means oh there's no

[03:41:46] have a we have a circle to forgot let's
[03:41:48] do it want you explore the new area I
[03:41:52] will they don't call me the exploration

[03:41:56] region 100 True l w okay let let me do
[03:41:58] let me level the cir we
[03:42:01] got where's the
[03:42:03] ciret
[03:42:08] um it should say new on it there it is
[03:42:10] crit rate ER this could be a
[03:42:14] beautiful beautiful ciret for so many
[03:42:17] characters cuz we need this
[03:42:21] set also I might spend some fragile
[03:42:24] resin on this domain like more we did
[03:42:26] already I might spend more because
[03:42:27] there's probably going to be a new set
[03:42:29] but we don't know what it is no leaks
[03:42:32] but like it's probably about that time
[03:42:34] but do I really want to farm the new
[03:42:35] domain if it's going to be for like a
[03:42:36] Geo character sorry I might we'll see I
[03:42:39] might say my resin or I might spend it
[03:42:41] now we'll see anyways plus
[03:42:45] four okay
[03:43:00] um please crit rate please don't ruin
[03:43:03] another
[03:43:08] circlet well that is another ciret
[03:43:13] cooked can we free from unique mode yeah
[03:43:15] we can turn off
[03:43:17] mods unless this okay if we roll flat
[03:43:19] attack again we're staying in unique
[03:43:21] mode [ __ ] you chat you guys are bad luck
[03:43:23] if I hit flat attack okay never mind
[03:43:25] this is fine um this piece is fine let's
[03:43:29] keep rolling I have no Mora
[03:43:33] though if you did Vermillion you could
[03:43:35] have had better luck true I actually
[03:43:37] would have true maybe we should ver
[03:43:51] ion okay I don't want to look at this
[03:43:53] piece anymore I'm sorry
[03:43:58] I
[03:44:02] um yeah I'm
[03:44:08] good
[03:44:16] you said you have to go somewhere I do
[03:44:17] but I'm not a responsible streamer so we
[03:44:20] are still farming you know what no we're
[03:44:22] not going to do ver million never
[03:44:24] mind we still have to do the stox video
[03:44:27] soon but I'll do that when I'm back well
[03:44:30] in a few days
[03:44:32] probably well dude it's been so long
[03:44:33] since I uploaded an account review I
[03:44:35] have to go through the editor apps and
[03:44:37] um we might do cursed account first we
[03:44:39] might do the the tenha if he's down
[03:44:41] first I don't know we haven't done a
[03:44:43] whale review in super long our last one
[03:44:45] was free to play so maybe we do the
[03:44:46] whale review we'll see do the Jeff
[03:44:48] account riew that's actually a good idea
[03:44:49] too I actually really want to and I know
[03:44:52] he's down so I probably should too damn
[03:44:54] dude I have so much content that's like
[03:44:56] a good thing I don't know why I'm
[03:44:57] complaining
[03:45:00] but I'm
[03:45:02] excited should the build of your
[03:45:04] teammates when you make guides uh okay
[03:45:06] yes and no I try to make guides for all
[03:45:07] the support characters so you should
[03:45:08] know like you can always look at that if
[03:45:11] you're wondering but when it's something
[03:45:12] unique I try to mention it for example
[03:45:14] in nevet I mentioned like with jangi you
[03:45:16] could go Petra whereas normally you go
[03:45:17] like milth on him um like I try to
[03:45:20] mention it but usually support
[03:45:22] characters I make their own dedicated
[03:45:23] guide because if I start to sing what
[03:45:25] build to go for every character in every
[03:45:27] team it would take way too long uh but
[03:45:29] if it's something unique I try to
[03:45:30] mention
[03:45:33] it
[03:45:38] smile
[03:45:42] em R in guide please okay em em em and
[03:45:45] then em weapon you're welcome Kain or
[03:45:48] dragon's bin you're
[03:45:53] welcome or the new battle pass
[03:46:02] weapon I hate this enemy I hate this one

[03:46:06] slow and I hate the the P the Pyro one
[03:46:08] in the abyss that [ __ ] pizza cutter
[03:46:11] and then F I hate it I actually hate it
[03:46:14] it keeps killing me by just comboing me
[03:46:15] into Oblivion I hate
[03:46:20] it your fin guide nice glad you liked it
[03:46:24] by review is done it's going be uploaded
[03:46:26] tomorrow probably and then um oh my God
[03:46:29] Jeepers sorry this could be good let's
[03:46:31] let's level it I mean crit rate on the
[03:46:32] set is kind of sus but it could be good
[03:46:34] we use like
[03:46:38] it
[03:46:44] should I level it now [ __ ] it we're not
[03:46:45] going to milk
[03:46:51] it so many five stars I can't wait to
[03:46:53] strong box we're like guaranteed a good
[03:46:54] child piece at this rate no that's
[03:46:56] copium I don't want to jinx it hopefully
[03:46:58] we going
[03:47:07] though okay I going a PO ch
[03:47:12] [Music]
[03:47:14] wait nope don't celebrate too soon if
[03:47:16] you count your chickens before they
[03:47:18] hatch and you sell your chickens and
[03:47:19] there's a buyer what if the chickens
[03:47:21] don't hatch the
[03:47:22] chickens don't celebrate too
[03:47:33] early so why don't you shut the [ __ ] up
[03:47:35] sorry I
[03:47:38] will
[03:47:59] I have an
[03:48:01] idea chat what if it's show
[03:48:08] time
[03:48:22] it's not bad a lot of mar show
[03:48:26] characters don't really need that much
[03:48:32] ER it's okay it's
[03:48:36] okay could have been a lot better but
[03:48:38] could have been a lot worse it's okay um
[03:48:40] I wish yeah m is very versatile it's all
[03:48:43] right it's all right could have been way
[03:48:44] better but
[03:48:53] bad crate set though yeah but like it's
[03:48:55] not like you have that much crit rate
[03:48:57] like linia has a [ __ ] ton but like nevet
[03:48:59] for example my NE is pretty good and
