[00:29:39] to have the best wardrobe Department in
[00:29:41] town now as our audience will be well
[00:29:45] aware the yeno is constantly roaming the
[00:29:48] universe and the universe is filled with
[00:29:51] the
[00:29:52] unknown it should come as no surprise
[00:29:54] then that the LA Fu I like the ghost
[00:29:56] girl I think share of strange encounters
[00:30:00] and speaking of strange St has really
[00:30:02] good character Des witness gave us a
[00:30:04] sneak peek into a place of mystery evil
[00:30:08] and Ghost Fire fix
[00:30:12] Garden I thought fixtel Garden was just
[00:30:15] some old abandoned place on the LA Fu
[00:30:18] why is it suddenly getting so much
[00:30:20] attention allow me to explain please
[00:30:23] explain a while back the artisanship
[00:30:25] commission's creation furnace was
[00:30:27] scattered and The Helio by trapped
[00:30:29] inside were able to escape wa they went
[00:30:32] to
[00:30:34] hide y fixt dral Garden I
[00:30:39] see wait what's that Helio people say
[00:30:42] that The Helio are the result of
[00:30:45] accumulated grievances they can possess
[00:30:47] people deceive
[00:30:49] the the soul wait she has paws as eyes
[00:30:53] look at that those possessed exhibit
[00:30:55] bizarre behavior and Restless
[00:30:58] thoughts it's a truly frightening
[00:31:01] spectacle but the creation furnace
[00:31:03] wasn't exactly fragile how could it just
[00:31:05] break rumor has it the artisanship
[00:31:08] commission surveillance recorded a
[00:31:10] gray-haired figure in dark clothing huh
[00:31:15] gray hair dark
[00:31:17] clothing did they have a baseball bat
[00:31:20] hey don't pin this on me the destruction
[00:31:22] of the
[00:31:24] creation disaster right Albert
[00:31:28] just tell us more about fixt
[00:31:32] garden fixt garden has always been
[00:31:35] overflowing with Yin energy y the garden
[00:31:38] itself is littered with suppression
[00:31:40] Towers Stone monoliths and ancient trees
[00:31:44] not creepy enough in the day when the
[00:31:46] Sun goes where is argen it's in South
[00:31:48] America it's pretty it's pretty obvious
[00:31:50] like if you look at a map the garden is
[00:31:52] layered and deceptive and it's easy to
[00:31:55] lose your bearings since the Helio moved
[00:31:59] in it's probably the most dangerous
[00:32:02] place on The
[00:32:03] lafu Helio are experts when it comes to
[00:32:07] possession and even the most experienced
[00:32:09] R wardens and araton spectral envoys yo
[00:32:12] why are they built like that wait a
[00:32:14] second pause wait a second I have
[00:32:16] question friend from your enemy and I
[00:32:18] would like answers tend to go south fast

[00:38:25] Commission they couldn't believe their

[00:38:32] comes in all shapes and sizes the key is
[00:38:35] to bring the best out of everyone still
[00:38:38] to her W's unique skill set isn't
[00:38:41] exactly a blessing people say she has
[00:38:44] the worst luck on the CN show 2v yeah
[00:38:47] cuz there's a creature right there like
[00:38:48] a wolf like how offici o know the deal
[00:38:51] well and blade has me my life running
[00:38:53] into ghosts sorry I probably fall over a
[00:38:55] lot too I remember remember one of my
[00:38:57] gings had the same problem lucky for her
[00:39:00] one of my sponsors sells this amazing
[00:39:02] remedy that can and we're getting
[00:39:05] sidetracked anyway I only told you half
[00:39:08] the story bad luck evil attraction call
[00:39:11] it what you like yeah it all started
[00:39:14] from a single unfortunate event oh when
[00:39:17] huwa was a little younger her tail was
[00:39:19] possessed by a monstrous long life
[00:39:22] species should I move I can there's not
[00:39:24] much here it's just like a yeah it was a
[00:39:26] helio bus that very same day the 10
[00:39:30] Lord's commission decided to seal the
[00:39:32] monster in its Hiding Place took hwa
[00:39:35] under their wing ah I get it so hwa is
[00:39:38] kind of like a a 10 Lord's guinea
[00:39:41] pig I think Hera had a similar fate plan
[00:39:44] for me that may have been part however
[00:39:46] the
[00:39:47] 10 that Hua had the ability to pacify
[00:39:51] the monster naturally anyone able to
[00:39:53] wield the power of a helio bus was seen
[00:39:56] as a potential weapon of War but she's
[00:39:59] just a baby how could a scared little
[00:40:02] foxy and girl ever take on the
[00:40:03] responsibilities of the 10
[00:40:06] Lords was well aware she's a scared a
[00:40:09] cat that's why she watches so many
[00:40:11] horror Mersa to train a
[00:40:13] courage call that Fighting Fear With
[00:40:17] Fear you're all weak y'all if that
[00:40:19] actually worked I'd have joined the
[00:40:21] stellon hunters already practicality
[00:40:23] aside W was willingness to confront her
[00:40:25] shortcoming is a true sign of
[00:40:27] professionalism not to mention having
[00:40:30] spent more than a few years in the
[00:40:31] company of a helio bus she's had to
[00:40:33] develop her own tricks for banishing
[00:40:36] evil attack Banner storm caller can deal
[00:40:40] wind damage to a single shaking look at
[00:40:42] her she's literally trembling looks like
[00:40:44] her tail is it's like Luigi Luigi's man
[00:40:49] Talisman protection bravely brandishes
[00:40:52] her Banner restoring HP to a single Ally
[00:40:55] Luigi Dash attack team are you sure
[00:40:57] she's not trying to
[00:41:00] surrender hu's ultimate tail spiritual
[00:41:03] domination can regenerate allies energy
[00:41:06] and increase their attack well so that's
[00:41:10] what a helius looks like [ __ ] sick
[00:41:12] wonder it took the 10 Lord's commission
[00:41:14] to seal it away when under the influence
[00:41:17] of her tail WWA has a few special
[00:41:19] talents after using her skill she
[00:41:22] receives sacrificed life sacrificed life
[00:41:25] can grant allies as set amount of HP
[00:41:27] restoration at the beginning of their
[00:41:29] respective turns or when they use their
[00:41:32] ultimate nice not B ultimate is good cuz
[00:41:35] that means you can like Panic All to

[01:10:41] dive into the major content that we have
[01:10:43] coming in version
[01:10:44] 4.2 in the intro finina said we need to
[01:10:47] make an appointment with Ser intendant
[01:10:49] shaval Moran so you know she's really
[01:10:52] busy as Fontaine Zaron and she's a
[01:10:54] pretty big celebrity at the opera house
[01:10:56] so the special program team gave me an
[01:10:58] itinerary to follow and it appears to
[01:11:00] show all of farina's recent plans fen's
[01:11:03] recent plans let me guess she's going to
[01:11:04] be going to trial and then another trial
[01:11:07] and then
[01:11:08] another actually that sounds about
[01:11:11] right Fang screenshot I'm sorry Fang if
[01:11:13] you see this big fan I just couldn't
[01:11:16] screenshot
[01:11:17] myself oh looks like Ray called it
[01:11:21] wow there is nothing more more important
[01:11:24] to finina than attending trials at the
[01:11:25] opera house but this trial is a little
[01:11:29] different from the usual my ideal have
[01:11:32] no stains I must correct you people here
[01:11:33] bear no I know I know I keep looking at
[01:11:36] the water rushing in like what's
[01:11:38] happening she said so Praise My
[01:11:40] magnificence and Purity curtain mhm mhm
[01:11:44] seems like you know maybe also nette is
[01:11:47] keeping an eye on things from from
[01:11:50] behind the scenes maybe very serious
[01:11:52] he's always keeping an eye on stuff and
[01:11:53] always just a little bit
[01:11:58] disappointed SC she tell them queen that
[01:12:01] wrote aode in version 4.2 Travelers will
[01:12:03] get to experience Act five of the
[01:12:05] Fontaine archon Quest masquerade of the
[01:12:07] guilty we'll team up with fonan friends
[01:12:10] to delve deeper into the hurricane of
[01:12:12] events and face the impending
[01:12:14] destruction foretold by the prophecy
[01:12:16] Travelers will gradually unveil new
[01:12:18] facts how she so cute how are you so
[01:12:20] cute and encounter an evil that has lur
[01:12:22] swirling death
[01:12:24] ooh I know I know swirling deps very
[01:12:30] spoopy um right so you know the prophecy
[01:12:34] in Fontaine is on the brink of coming
[01:12:36] true and this is possibly the greatest
[01:12:39] crisis we faced in our journey through
[01:12:42] Tad definitely in version 4.1 we learned
[01:12:45] about this precarious situation
[01:12:47] involving the rising primordial seawater
[01:12:49] noet barely arrived in time to hold back
[01:12:51] the seawater from C
[01:12:54] but still the
[01:12:56] hased Japanese posted a
[01:13:01] character Japanese I'm cheing the
[01:13:04] assistance provided us yes whatever yes
[01:13:07] that means she might be playable please
[01:13:09] please I can fix her [ __ ] it I don't
[01:13:11] even want to fix her I believe her
[01:13:13] there's only so much that we can say
[01:13:16] Travelers will have to go and play
[01:13:17] through the verion themselves the godur
[01:13:20] and stories to come I'll shut up after I
[01:13:22] promise they posted
[01:13:24] so be sure to play through uncover
[01:13:26] Hidden Truths and witness this epic
[01:13:29] chapter of fontaine's history for
[01:13:30] yourself this has 40K likes in four
[01:13:33] minutes becomes available sounds good oh
[01:13:37] this skirk hey question have we
[01:13:40] forgotten a pretty important character
[01:13:42] who's been missing from the Fortress of
[01:13:44] meped oh yeah you mean child yeah yeah
[01:13:50] we searched all over the Fortress for
[01:13:52] him
[01:13:54] yep I I guess we'll just have to live
[01:13:56] with the suspense for a little longer
[01:13:59] not ideal but it's fine it is what it is
[01:14:02] uh it is what it is but we saw child at
[01:14:05] the end of the last versions archon
[01:14:07] Quest so it probably won't be long until
[01:14:10] we see him again okay good okay but we
[01:14:13] really need to talk about child master
[01:14:14] who taught him when he was in the abyss
[01:14:15] there we go wait is there Jing didn't
[01:14:17] Jing like because she's confronted with
[01:14:19] a crisis that's tough for even one of
[01:14:21] the great elemental dragons
[01:14:25] Fontaine will have the Travelers help
[01:14:27] but what choices will our Hydro archon
[01:14:29] make in the face of the crisis uh uh
[01:14:34] well just like the prophecy itself all
[01:14:37] will be revealed at The Faded time but
[01:14:41] knowing finina perhaps she'll have made
[01:14:43] some
[01:14:45] preparations once again
[01:14:49] disappointed no way come on guys have
[01:14:52] some
[01:14:54] face okay to bolster everyone's

[01:18:50] is a hydro sword user okay M dude that
[01:18:53] is literally a Pokemon team to an AR
[01:18:58] combat when in this state her Elemental
[01:19:00] skill invites three members they have
[01:19:03] different icds each right melala
[01:19:06] sendon and gent user that's [ __ ] sick
[01:19:09] though love it it's so cute thank Fox
[01:19:13] she looks like a support that means I
[01:19:14] don't have to yeah that's so sick oh my
[01:19:16] God that's opponent do know I actually
[01:19:18] don't know the active character ooh
[01:19:21] their damage increases the more
[01:19:23] characters there are in the party over a
[01:19:25] certain HP
[01:19:27] amount okay I was listening to all that
[01:19:29] but at the very top you said that she
[01:19:31] usually defaults to an UIA ARCA
[01:19:34] alignment so she has more than one
[01:19:36] alignment yes exactly Fin's charged
[01:19:39] attack not only deals physical damage
[01:19:42] also but I do not care about usia
[01:19:44] pneumonia I I'm sorry I'm sorry
[01:19:46] respectfully it it helps against like
[01:19:48] two enemies I don't care that much but
[01:19:51] it is cool that you can do both sure
[01:19:53] does Fin's Elemental skill changes
[01:19:56] depending on whether she is aligned with
[01:19:57] usia or that's cool it's super
[01:20:01] cool sides charged
[01:20:03] attacka ARA alignment her Elemental
[01:20:07] skill summons the singer of many wat
[01:20:10] that is sick no the three ones are
[01:20:11] cooler never mind I lied wait does that
[01:20:13] heal the summons created by Elemental
[01:20:16] skill will remain on the field for a
[01:20:18] period of time even after finina is
[01:20:21] switched out finina Elemental burst
[01:20:24] deals damage to surrounding opponents
[01:20:27] and when the party member's HP increases
[01:20:29] or decreases finina will accumulate
[01:20:32] Fanfare
[01:20:35] Point that's my trumpet amaz so um
[01:20:39] finina increases the damage and the
[01:20:41] incoming healing bonus of nearby party
[01:20:44] members based on the amount of fanfare
[01:20:46] she has wow it seems like this fighting
[01:20:48] style really suits Fin's character it's
[01:20:50] very showy and unpredictable totally I
[01:20:54] can already see the fluctuations in my
[01:20:56] team's HP bar that healing skill might
[01:20:58] come in handy yeah for real and um due
[01:21:02] to her knowledge of deep water aberant
[01:21:04] fina's Pro Talent can deas cool down
[01:21:07] ability if she fluctuates your HP does
[01:21:10] this not make Vermilion Hereafter
[01:21:12] efficient to farm that'll make it even
[01:21:15] easier was I not a Visionary lurking in
[01:21:18] the deaths always the secret lurking in
[01:21:21] the that's my Arcon that's my archon and
[01:21:23] I almost forgot um whenever finina
[01:21:26] summons is on the field finina gains the
[01:21:30] ability Vermon we go water Mar say
[01:21:33] probably better but it is what it
[01:21:35] is yes hey um I actually saw that Fin's
[01:21:38] outfit changes whenever she switches
[01:21:40] between Arco oh yeah yeah good ey you're
[01:21:43] correct dude I actually called it though
[01:21:45] I actually called it you know such
[01:21:47] called I suppose uh yes uh so if you
[01:21:51] want to learn more about Kina then be
[01:21:54] sure to accompany her on her story Quest

[01:26:45] both featured in version 4.2 event
[01:26:49] wishes in the first half of version
[01:26:52] sorry I screenshot we'll have event
[01:26:54] wishes showcasing finina andu during
[01:26:57] this time
[01:26:59] for damages your team B is going to be a
[01:27:01] lot better by the way just from what we
[01:27:02] know from what they said right here not
[01:27:04] porn acting uh just so you know a new
[01:27:07] five star sword blender of tranquil that
[01:27:10] sword looks [ __ ] sick by the way I
[01:27:12] want it I hope it's good I'm probably
[01:27:14] going to pull for it it looks sick
[01:27:17] sword it's actually sick of version 4.
[01:27:25] andato okay let's take a look at what
[01:27:28] other information we can learn from
[01:27:29] Fin's itinerary I was a huge AO fan and
[01:27:32] then neet came out now I need to think
[01:27:34] before I make a video not bench not Ben
[01:27:36] even aort I'm literally rank one
[01:27:38] worldwide okay I will it says strange
[01:27:41] Rumblings have been heard in the depths
[01:27:43] of fontaine's waters that's cool I think
[01:27:45] that's
[01:27:46] sick oh it's here
[01:27:50] already oh
[01:27:54] whale whale whale it looks like it's in
[01:27:57] a sea of pink and blue stars that's so
[01:28:02] pretty that's a big whale yeah isn't
[01:28:05] this the whale that The Travelers saw in
[01:28:07] child's Vision at the end of the
[01:28:09] version1 archon quest yep it's the same
[01:28:13] one after ravaging its way through the
[01:28:16] primordial this otherworldly creature
[01:28:18] has that
[01:28:20] long and
[01:28:22] it's not me I'm a dolphin at most I'm a
[01:28:26] shrimp not a shrimp I'm a cute seal I'm
[01:28:29] not a oh I hope not I get this feeling
[01:28:34] uh that this isn't the type of opponent
[01:28:36] that we can just Brute Force our way
[01:28:38] through you know exactly in the first
[01:28:41] phase it will use its gigantic size to
[01:28:43] Target The Traveler with massive AOE
[01:28:45] attacks from all directions dodging is
[01:28:48] definitely your friend with this one y
[01:28:51] why is bro Auto ATT on so there also
[01:28:54] seems to be why are they playing a bloom
[01:28:57] Team without they forgot yo you didn't
[01:28:59] put y excuse me Professor since we can't
[01:29:02] out we'll have to outsmart it instead
[01:29:06] the creature just freed itself from
[01:29:07] captivity and is grimming with anger so
[01:29:10] if you can find a way toiz on that
[01:29:14] perhaps you'll also find its
[01:29:16] weaknesses oh okay wait is is somebody
[01:29:20] being eaten is it it even possible to
[01:29:23] survive oh this boss yeah so during the
[01:29:25] animation you have to quickly enter your
[01:29:27] credit card information and if you do it
[01:29:29] within it looks like uh 5 Seconds you
[01:29:31] can beat the boss if you can't with a
[01:29:33] massive sword massive sword oh these
[01:29:37] creatures also look Vaguely Familiar to
[01:29:38] me I wonder what the deal is with all of
[01:29:40] this perhaps defeating this mysterious
[01:29:43] enemy within this space will be the key
[01:29:45] to defeating the whale Travelers will
[01:29:47] need to experiment for themselves what
[01:29:49] are those things peeking on the screen
[01:29:50] like at the bottom is that fin truth it
[01:29:52] looks like a ability there's spectating
[01:29:55] in version
[01:29:57] 4.2 that's sick that's actually really
[01:29:59] cool oh man this boss looks really
[01:30:02] really tough um what happens if we for
[01:30:04] some reason can't defeat it you die and
[01:30:06] you don't get the MS help get
[01:30:10] good an option will appear on the
[01:30:12] challenge failed screen the difficulty
[01:30:14] of the boss if Travelers are struggling
[01:30:16] to them during a main quest sure it's
[01:30:18] fine hopefully this provides a smoother
[01:30:20] gaming experience for actually don't
[01:30:22] mind that I it makes my guys useless
[01:30:25] need
[01:30:26] to trying if you're casual F

[01:31:53] lines and a new boss but I hope you're
[01:31:55] still eager for new content Travelers
[01:31:58] because there's still more to come take
[01:32:00] a look at what other Lear from oh eight
[01:32:05] player co-op aside from investigating
[01:32:08] crises it seems like our Hydro archon
[01:32:10] also goes on occasional excursions
[01:32:12] throughout
[01:32:13] Fontaine who knew she did all this work
[01:32:15] behind the scenes I certainly didn't
[01:32:19] well you know maybe she's just using it
[01:32:21] as foggy Forest terrestrial sea and
[01:32:24] fatherless to and
[01:32:27] excuses
[01:32:28] typical hey it seems like the places
[01:32:30] finina has chosen to visit this time
[01:32:32] feature some peculiar
[01:32:34] Landscapes oh yeah it looks like Farina
[01:32:37] is an aranas Forest on the east side of
[01:32:41] Fontaine and that's right behind the
[01:32:44] Opera House what a cool place you think
[01:32:48] this is another tree we're going to have
[01:32:49] to get sigs for be hiding some Secrets
[01:32:52] oh no definit be a video game if there
[01:32:55] weren't Secrets I
[01:32:57] the definitely not what they seem here
[01:32:59] for example strange things have been
[01:33:01] happening with the water veins around
[01:33:03] lock urania as you can see a strong
[01:33:06] Windstorm has gathered around the vortex
[01:33:08] rising from the middle of the lake it's
[01:33:09] almost like it's preventing certain
[01:33:11] things from getting closer and forcibly
[01:33:13] pushing other things away looks cool and
[01:33:17] take a look at this the foggy is she
[01:33:18] eating cake are we that fog is really
[01:33:22] that's why they call the foggy Forest
[01:33:25] P the weeping willow of the lake ooh it
[01:33:29] looks all withered and and the water
[01:33:32] doesn't look quite right like it's
[01:33:35] cloudy or something do you see that it's
[01:33:37] fine Ki can walk through exactly it
[01:33:39] seems like Verina also realized
[01:33:41] something was off it looks like she
[01:33:43] headed underwater and investigate and
[01:33:45] what did she find a number of
[01:33:47] contaminated bacterial mats uhoh e
[01:33:50] speaking of
[01:33:52] there are always new things to discover
[01:33:54] beneath fontaine's Waters in this update

[01:34:49] middle of the sea perhaps it's is also
[01:34:51] guarding some unspeakable Secrets oo

[01:34:57] next stop on so let's go check it out

[01:35:03] this Tower since they've arrived in
[01:35:05] Fontaine I'm so excited that we finally
[01:35:07] get to check it out yes sorry sorry I
[01:35:10] did actually yeah in version 4.2 the
[01:35:13] sealed ruin Tower is the focus of a
[01:35:15] quest series called search in the algae
[01:35:19] sea I know and after unlocking four
[01:35:23] seals along its perimeter the tower and
[01:35:26] its long buried secrets will be unveiled
[01:35:29] to us oh
[01:35:31] amazing okay it would feel great to

[01:36:00] and this is not limited to the two new
[01:36:01] regions in this update the prophesy if
[01:36:03] you're listening you could take that

[01:36:53] discover in
[01:36:54] the itinerary doesn't stop there freeze
[01:36:57] it you can't freeze it it looks like
[01:36:59] she's arranged to spend some time with
[01:37:01] her subject maybe you can I actually
[01:37:02] don't know it's a world boss right
[01:37:04] pretty personable who's to say she might
[01:37:06] even make an appearance at the events
[01:37:07] taking place in Fontaine speaking of
[01:37:10] let's move on to the event
[01:37:13] portion all right the fonan fishing
[01:37:15] Association has recently posted a
[01:37:17] commission inv that P is C
[01:37:21] Island yay F I love know he's cute I
[01:37:26] mean I like the Penguins to be involved
[01:37:29] that little Clockwork penguin next to
[01:37:31] him must be one of his other companions
[01:37:34] but it doesn't look like pear actually
[01:37:36] it's name is FY the name comes from a
[01:37:39] Fontan fairy tale that describ a
[01:37:41] terrifying creature the one voice for
[01:37:43] keep saying chat adults would use the
[01:37:45] story to keep children away from the
[01:37:46] shore as The Story Goes children who
[01:37:50] play by the water are are food for thy
[01:37:52] to devour o yeah for real well children
[01:37:57] must be pretty afraid of that creature I
[01:38:00] know right Frost is coming getting gear
[01:38:02] a little unusual for f to give this
[01:38:04] little penguin a name like that there
[01:38:06] must be some other reason wait hey does
[01:38:09] this event also have something to do
[01:38:11] with this Clockwork penguin absolutely
[01:38:14] in this event we'll be helping frem make
[01:38:16] some improvements to this little
[01:38:17] Clockwork
[01:38:18] penguin a total of three main
[01:38:22] as for the we'll repair the penguin by
[01:38:25] fixing its circuits and reconnecting the
[01:38:27] mother in return the little guy will
[01:38:30] help us out on our journey oh I love

[01:38:44] underwater and find the items that we
[01:38:46] need for the penguin H and uh you know
[01:38:49] what what happens if we run into certain
[01:38:52] speed bumps on our adventure you know
[01:38:54] like Monsters puzzles and all that jazz
[01:38:58] well it seems like the perfect
[01:39:00] opportunity for a little penguin buddy
[01:39:01] to shine exactly in the third stage of
[01:39:05] the event the Clockwork penguin will
[01:39:06] help us defeat monsters lurking around a
[01:39:09] specific domain and obtain any Treasures
[01:39:11] that they may be guarding of course the
[01:39:14] Clockwork penguin will provide different
[01:39:15] Buffs in each battle to help Travelers
[01:39:17] emerge Victorious are they playing NE
[01:39:19] with story behind battles Travelers will
[01:39:22] just have to find out for themselves

[01:40:20] marous gels to instruct the little fungi
[01:40:23] to unleash powerful skills yeah
[01:40:26] Travelers will hopefully enjoy playing
[01:40:28] with the fungi more than ever here's
[01:40:30] hoping we uh actually I have a little
[01:40:32] note here to pass along from our
[01:40:34] developer
[01:40:35] friends the note some folding while they
[01:40:38] hope to make the little fungi and some
[01:40:40] other events permanent so Travelers can
[01:40:42] play at any time the team feels that the
[01:40:44] current design doesn't adequately
[01:40:46] sustain long-term gameplay so they're
[01:40:48] going to continue iterating optimizing
[01:40:50] and improving this event while also
[01:40:52] working hard to develop interesting
[01:40:54] content that isant to the overall game
[01:40:56] wait is this a permanent event the one
[01:40:59] time I look away all right okay let's
[01:41:02] take a look at what else itinerary has
[01:41:05] in
[01:41:06] store oh it's the graph adversarial
[01:41:09] technology experiment live never
[01:41:11] trusting chat again I'm more what the
[01:41:14] [ __ ] is this some adversaries let me add
[01:41:18] them I wish I could but
[01:41:21] involve fighting a researcher obsessed
[01:41:24] with adversarial technology made great
[01:41:27] contributions to the study of counter
[01:41:28] criminal image recognition she believes
[01:41:31] that her research can help her achieve
[01:41:32] great success but her scholarly
[01:41:35] responsibilities make it difficult for
[01:41:36] her to collect the field samples that
[01:41:38] she needs M I'm guessing this is where
[01:41:41] the traveler comes in okay you're not
[01:41:44] wrong but Pauline's request is actually
[01:41:47] pretty reasonable to receive rewards
[01:41:49] simply submit photographs of five
[01:41:51] different sample types that match the
[01:41:52] characteristic that's given on each day
[01:41:54] sounds simple enough you can also
[01:41:56] exchange these samples with your friends
[01:41:59] you might be able to find useful
[01:42:01] references for the samples that you need
[01:42:03] to collect in the adventure archive at
[01:42:05] the end of the quest Travelers will
[01:42:07] receive a special gift from Pauline okay
[01:42:10] special gift that's right it's the zoom
[01:42:12] lens we mentioned during Charlotte's
[01:42:14] character introduction oh how fun to use
[01:42:17] it just equip the camera and activate
[01:42:19] the zoom lens in your inventory the zoom
[01:42:21] lens can be attached to all cameras
[01:42:23] obtained in the game up to this point oh
[01:42:24] my god when equipped with other
[01:42:25] characters the zoom lens won't be able
[01:42:27] to be used in combat but if you switch
[01:42:29] to Charlotte and hold her Elemental
[01:42:32] skill you'll be able to snap picks with
[01:42:34] zoom lens fighting you can even use it
[01:42:37] in domains ooh double wo uh oh my gosh
[01:42:41] that's awesome and I bet Travelers will
[01:42:43] be able to capture some amazing moments
[01:42:45] in co-op mode too and even if you miss
[01:42:49] the chance to participate in the event
[01:42:51] there's no need to worry Travelers will
[01:42:53] still be able to obtain the zoom lens
[01:42:55] after the event ends
[01:42:58] D it seems like finina has also learned
[01:43:02] of the existence of a domain shroud yes
[01:43:05] is the one I think it is Travelers who
[01:43:08] Master the LEL I likey D together I like
[01:43:11] Misty dungeon will be able to easily
[01:43:14] beat their opponents this one's fun now
[01:43:15] less experienced Travelers like myself
[01:43:17] don't need to worry either it is right
[01:43:20] that's what I'm thinking of the Buffs
[01:43:21] brought about my favorite still the one
[01:43:22] with like a bunch of bosses but this
[01:43:25] one's Travelers who are more confident
[01:43:27] in their combat skills can choose to
[01:43:29] jump straight to the final challenge we
[01:43:32] might if this is drink Fin's ban Al the
[01:43:34] lay line overflow event will return at
[01:43:36] the
[01:43:38] end now might be the perfect time to
[01:43:40] start building your parties I mean we
[01:43:42] take those hopefully you're all excited
[01:43:44] for the fabulous events that version 4.2
[01:43:46] has in store but there are still more
[01:43:49] surprises to sh share yay I know let get
[01:43:53] into them well before we get into them

[01:50:32] I'm really hyped for her uh the little
[01:50:33] pets are cool her brst looks cool uh
[01:50:36] also chat oh what the [ __ ] oh I logged
[01:50:38] on my phone by accident I actually
[01:50:39] didn't mean to anyways chat did I not
[01:50:42] listen did I not predict wait listen
[01:50:45] calm down did I not
[01:50:48] predict that Vermilion would be good
[01:50:50] best in thought on every single
[01:50:51] character yes they released Mari chose
[01:50:54] which is the same thing but with crit
[01:50:55] cool but did I not predict that in like
[01:50:58] version 2.1 before before any of these
[01:51:01] any of the sus came out did I not
[01:51:04] predict that Vermillion would be the
[01:51:06] smartest investment which is why I've
[01:51:08] been farming it for years to
[01:51:10] come Zio dlea short let me see let me
[01:51:15] pull this up that didn't work this
[01:51:16] literally did not work what is my short
[01:51:18] called let me pull up oh there it is
[01:51:23] only on one character no it's not no
[01:51:25] it's not no it's not okay ridle me this
[01:51:27] CI and Toma before dend they weren't
[01:51:30] used that much they weren't then D came
[01:51:32] out and now people are calling Kookie
[01:51:34] the official of gen impact oh my God I
[01:51:36] love Kookie Kookie saved my life okay
[01:51:38] Vermilion Hereafter right now it's only
[01:51:40] really used on Shia true about it but
[01:51:42] not only is it versatile because the two
[01:51:44] piece gives you attack percent when you
[01:51:45] take damage in your burst the four piece
[01:51:47] also gives you a ton of attack percent
[01:51:49] so when we get the new new region of
[01:51:50] Conor and Dan Leaf's alt void prism okay
[01:51:54] I thought it was going to be Dan's Leaf
[01:51:56] but this is literally finina it gives
[01:51:57] you damage perc will give you attack
[01:52:00] when you take damage making Vermilion
[01:52:02] best in on especially those without
[01:52:06] their signature set so while we don't
[01:52:08] discuss leaks on this channel I think
[01:52:09] let's just call it a hunch that
[01:52:11] Vermilion is going to be best thought on
[01:52:12] everyone don't Farm Vermilion dude now
[01:52:14] look Unfortunately they released Mar CH
[01:52:17] which is like a better Vermilion for
[01:52:18] everyone except Shia how however however
[01:52:21] however hey hey it still stalks it still
[01:52:27] stalks I'm just say what the [ __ ] wait

[01:58:20] something ominous about yeah rib boo
[01:58:21] minus one Navia will use trial to show
[01:58:24] the world the true meaning
[01:58:27] of judgment
[01:58:29] is can you imagine if Navia dies then we

[01:58:36] [Music]

[01:59:48] dramatic
[01:59:49] trial farewell

[02:00:19] record if you guys don't know I I got to
[02:00:21] bring this up now before uh we slow down
[02:00:23] a little there apparently there's that
[02:00:25] was sick by the way that was one of the
[02:00:26] most hype previews we've seen in a while
[02:00:28] well even the like the 4.0 one was
[02:00:30] really hyped too but this one is was
[02:00:31] super hyped but apparently there's a
[02:00:33] zenist announcement tonight so expect
[02:00:38] another stream I'm probably going to
[02:00:40] stream again tonight because I don't
[02:00:42] know what this is but I kind of want to
[02:00:44] be live for this if I can so I'll try
[02:00:47] because this looks really hype
[02:00:51] um no this is like for us it's midnight
[02:00:59] right I might get baited if it's not a
[02:01:02] big announcement then I might get baited
[02:01:03] but it should be big cuz why else would
[02:01:05] they why would they do this if it's not
[02:01:08] big like
[02:01:11] look right why would they do
[02:01:17] that to bait you
[02:01:25] so yeah that's what I think
[02:01:31] um the bang Boos are cute I'm very
[02:01:34] excited Z we played the ZZ beta like
[02:01:36] closed beta a while ago on stream it was
[02:01:38] fun I enjoyed it not many of you saw it
[02:01:41] but I actually made a video out of it
[02:01:42] that was back when I was saying true it
[02:01:45] wasn't even a sponsored video I just
[02:01:46] streamed it and then made a video out of
[02:01:48] it I didn't even pay me I was just for
[02:01:50] fun and I enjoyed
[02:01:52] it so um we'll see we'll see if it uh
[02:01:56] yeah we'll
[02:01:57] see Omega L scammed bro it was fun it

[02:02:25] right can I hear people in my house
[02:02:27] right now I should probably go up and
[02:02:28] see what's happening um however expect
[02:02:31] the stream tonight for zenis before we
[02:02:32] go also also also also chat quick road
[02:02:35] map I'm going to try to stream as much
[02:02:37] as I can but it's lowkey oh also there's
[02:02:39] two second Channel videos that are done
[02:02:40] I just need to upload them there's a
[02:02:42] video uh rli's video is
[02:02:44] done and um the reacting to the Reddit
[02:02:48] is done so so we're going to upload both
[02:02:49] those uh also listen chat I don't know
[02:02:53] how I'm going to have time to do this
[02:02:55] like I'm going to try to stream as much
[02:02:56] as I can but I have to record a finina
[02:02:59] guide and then if finina cuz there's a
[02:03:02] chance that finina [ __ ] all your HP
[02:03:04] which means that Mar might be good on
[02:03:05] literally every single character which
[02:03:07] means that I'm going to have to spend
[02:03:08] more time talking about every character
[02:03:09] and every guide ever which means I might
[02:03:11] make a separate video on it so I might
[02:03:12] make two finina videos I don't know if I
[02:03:14] will but I might and on top of that
[02:03:16] baiju is going to need a new video and
[02:03:18] charlot is going to need a guide so it's
[02:03:19] four that I'm going to have to make in
[02:03:21] the next like 5 days so it's going to be
[02:03:23] hard I don't know how I'm going to do it
[02:03:25] but I'm going to be busy so I'll try to
[02:03:26] stream as much as I can I also have to
[02:03:28] do the archon quest before it's out in

[02:03:33] outfit just say it does I mean we know
[02:03:36] from the trailer and like I've heard
[02:03:38] rumors but like I made sure not to look
[02:03:40] at leaks like I'm going to look into it
[02:03:41] once I can play finina and have access
[02:03:43] to her and and all that but for now it's
[02:03:45] just like I don't want to mislead anyone
