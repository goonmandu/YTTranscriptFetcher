[00:25:43] apparently I'll have to show a little
[00:25:44] more of my true capabilities
[00:25:48] I did not realize that you had such a
[00:25:50] Pasha for getting into dangerous
[00:25:52] situations
[00:25:54] okay who the [ __ ] slides a French word
[00:25:56] in here
[00:25:58] what

[00:26:06] yay Miko [ __ ] it
[00:26:08] I'm not gonna click on that I'm not
[00:26:09] gonna click on that uh who would slide a
[00:26:12] French word here
[00:26:15] wouldn't say that
[00:26:22] I knew it because French I knew it was
[00:26:23] French he actually whispered that in my
[00:26:25] ear I knew it was that why listen wrong
[00:26:27] one wrong one
[00:26:28] apparently I'll have to show a little
[00:26:30] more of my true capabilities
[00:26:33] I did not realize that you had such a
[00:26:35] pencil yeah it makes sense because he's
[00:26:36] a dragon so he wouldn't hide it like
[00:26:38] he'd hide it and then he said a French
[00:26:40] word so that's how I knew
[00:26:43] bro thinks penchant is a French word I
[00:26:46] mean Pasha is a word in French it might
[00:26:48] also be an English word but no one cares

[00:27:38] this is so loud
[00:27:43] I think they're all good
[00:27:45] so I think that's good
[00:27:48] I think that's also good information
[00:27:55] and I think the English one's good too
[00:27:57] apparently you don't have to show a
[00:27:58] little more of my true capability I
[00:28:00] think they're all good

[00:49:42] Banner three five star characters of
[00:49:45] your choice on the same Banner true you
[00:49:48] can only get one though that's the
[00:49:49] downside I wish you could get more but
[00:49:51] you choose three of any five star and
[00:49:53] you're guaranteed one on your first uh
[00:49:55] five star of the banner yep and you get
[00:49:57] a free standard Banner five star

[00:50:57] uh I leveled my wolf Fang off stream
[00:51:01] so that I actually have a nice another
[00:51:02] sword I can use a good four star option
[00:51:04] a good battle pass option a great weapon
[00:51:06] I like it so we leveled it boom it's
[00:51:08] level 90 now which is pretty cool
[00:51:12] I have to do the monstat uh weapon
[00:51:14] domain which made me want to walk
[00:51:16] through the ocean

[00:51:29] Auto add Auto takes forever

[00:51:47] trying to be here for a day look at this
[00:51:49] I am not trying to be here for a day and
[00:51:52] then I lose my three star weapons and
[00:51:54] I'm gonna forget about them and then we
[00:51:55] have another harbinger of [ __ ] Dawn
[00:51:57] incident I'm not trying to go through
[00:51:58] that
[00:52:03] daily commission rewards let's go back

[00:52:47] New Village

[00:53:40] my
[00:53:41] uh we could put we could put we could
[00:53:43] put like the
[00:53:46] berries yeah but I like berries because
[00:53:48] you can make jam with them
[00:54:06] I guess I could put more mint in I don't
[00:54:08] really need more mint
[00:54:16] s you can just buy Jam yeah but that's
[00:54:19] expensive dude Mora is more of matters
[00:54:22] playing ganshin
[00:54:25] wow I appreciate that is very
[00:54:30] about your head
[00:54:44] ah not bad talibukes are good the ores

[00:55:07] [Music]
[00:55:11] this is equity I didn't check please be
[00:55:13] Equity it is
[00:55:16] it's worth leveling Ian Hugh yes but not
[00:55:18] as important as his normal attacks
[00:55:22] in the name of the princesses
[00:55:25] the name of the princess in this
[00:55:27] domain's really easy so we actually can
[00:55:29] play a friendship team usually I like to
[00:55:30] have like good supports for another that
[00:55:32] and like one friendship character but
[00:55:34] this doing is really easy so we could
[00:55:35] put like I mean Baidu gives us
[00:55:37] friendship Lenny needs friendship and
[00:55:40] then this won't take long maybe just
[00:55:42] like official who's already finished

[01:15:55] makes me happy but like
[01:15:56] I don't know I think it's like
[01:16:00] it's weird if floor 12 goes from hard to
[01:16:02] easy to hard to easy to hard to easy
[01:16:03] with no like [ __ ] logic behind it but
[01:16:06] we'll see
[01:16:09] I don't like when it does that
[01:16:19] my never that ratio is 31 to 2114 with
[01:16:22] prototype Amber it's bad isn't it okay
[01:16:24] that is a dumb and misleading question
[01:16:26] because that is bad but if you're
[01:16:28] running man I should say then your crit
[01:16:29] ratio isn't actually 31 so add up plus
[01:16:31] 36 of that and then that's fine
[01:16:34] 36 was 31 that's like 67 36 yeah so
[01:16:38] that's not that bad uh you still want
[01:16:40] more crude rate though
[01:16:41] but it's fine I have 52. yeah it's still
[01:16:45] like should be higher but whatever
[01:16:48] golf golf
[01:16:52] oh you actually see the water though
[01:16:55] I don't know you saw it
[01:16:58] 306 crit damage Pepe W how is it Pepe W
[01:17:01] he gets crit damage from his [ __ ]
[01:17:03] weapon and from his [ __ ] Ascension
[01:17:05] okay it's not even me it's you
[01:17:08] we only have 20 here we only have 13
[01:17:11] crit damage
[01:17:12] two seven here twenty okay that's a lot
[01:17:17] and then a circle it we literally don't
[01:17:19] even have that much could damage on our
[01:17:20] pieces it's Ascension I spit over
[01:17:22] Ascension plus uh weapon
[01:17:28] cringe weapon dude I
[01:17:31] oh
[01:17:33] check she as we
[01:17:35] oh Robin hi this is
[01:17:42] that what you want me to check oh
[01:17:43] there's another one have you seen
[01:17:44] genchin French dub
[01:17:46] I'm not
[01:17:54] is it actually you gulping each time I
[01:17:57] thought it was a soundboard
[01:18:04] bro those pieces are so good I'm sad I
[01:18:06] have no luck in that domain okay
[01:18:08] I'm going to release a video soon it was
[01:18:10] supposed to be out a while ago but
[01:18:11] there's some delays it is what it is of
[01:18:13] me spending 7 000 resin in this domain
[01:18:15] we use like 70 fragile or 60 fragile
[01:18:18] and uh we still don't have a golden
[01:18:21] troop set for our official we have one
[01:18:23] if we want em on every stat which is
[01:18:24] fine if we're aggravating but as a
[01:18:26] general set we literally like like this
[01:18:28] this is a good goblet for aggravate
[01:18:30] don't get me wrong but in general like
[01:18:31] we literally I don't have a sense like
[01:18:33] our marriages they got kind of Lucky but
[01:18:36] we don't have a Lenny set either like
[01:18:38] our Lenny's on [ __ ] two piss two piss
[01:18:40] where's Lindy
[01:18:42] because we don't have a like I only have
[01:18:45] a good I got lucky I have a good match
[01:18:46] we'll see for Neville because I got a
[01:18:48] good HP sense but uh like a decent one
[01:18:51] but I don't have an attack one so I
[01:18:53] can't use it on Lenny and I can't use uh
[01:18:56] uh I don't have official set either so
[01:18:57] we kind of got [ __ ] in this event
[01:19:00] but at least never let got like uh you
[01:19:02] know he got he got an HP one
[01:19:06] I'm so used to watching vas I tried
[01:19:07] skipping for
[01:19:11] you guys are upsetting me so much that
[01:19:13] I'm hitting my desk and now my desk has
[01:19:14] like a curve to it and I can't aim
[01:19:16] straight anymore so what I want
[01:19:22] I'm gonna I'm gonna behave
[01:19:24] okay listen we're gonna now do the abyss
[01:19:28] we're gonna play normal teams we're
[01:19:30] gonna try never let soloing maybe uh but
[01:19:33] we probably need more ER if we're gonna
[01:19:34] solo right anyways we're gonna do that
[01:19:36] stuff
[01:19:37] and we're also gonna do a four star only
[01:19:39] clear now you'll be like oh my God he's
[01:19:41] gearing he's I wish I could skip Vaude
[01:19:44] friends skip five hours he's gearing
[01:19:46] listen
[01:19:48] listen
[01:19:49] I geared off stream the villette geared
[01:19:51] official actually let me add
[01:19:53] never let geared official
[01:19:58] geared but this answering this is not a
[01:20:00] four-star weapon so the creation looks
[01:20:01] less but still baiju Ard Xiao geared
[01:20:05] also our shallow he's on 140 ER right
[01:20:07] now we don't need that much 140 ERS for
[01:20:09] losers
[01:20:10] and I'm not a loser
[01:20:12] actually I play c0 farzan no one asked
[01:20:18] uh we're gonna go wait where's my good
[01:20:20] circuit this one or is this one better
[01:20:22] this one has a lot of attack
[01:20:25] uh
[01:20:28] what is it
[01:20:42] okay this is
[01:20:44] anyways kazua geared wait how much yard
[01:20:47] was that now 160 that's fine for now
[01:20:48] Sino
[01:20:51] no I I cleared the vine broom I can't
[01:20:56] I miss clicked on my soundbar and I
[01:20:58] removed the vine boom wait let me add it
[01:21:00] again [ __ ]
[01:21:07] um
[01:21:12] wait what the [ __ ] just happened
[01:21:15] wait I
[01:21:17] okay it's fine
[01:21:20] does it work it does
[01:21:23] what does this do okay cool
[01:21:26] all right uh yeah Mikko geared right in
[01:21:30] kaching geared I'll hide them geared
[01:21:33] nahida geared nilu geared yilon
[01:21:39] I [ __ ] her up a little but for us
[01:21:40] intro but she's still gear enough so
[01:21:42] geared kokomi uh
[01:21:48] Hotel
[01:21:50] geared sucrose 887 a.m geared
[01:22:07] whatever I mean it's fine Kaya look at
[01:22:10] look at our Kaya beautiful beautiful
[01:22:12] Kyle I would give him wolfang but I want
[01:22:15] to try using a nonpass weapon just
[01:22:16] because but I want to use little thing
[01:22:18] on them but yeah boom he's geared also
[01:22:19] our arbedo boom [ __ ] geared also also
[01:22:23] also Bennett geared four-star weapon two
[01:22:26] boom and also also also shangling geared
[01:22:30] because we're gonna play then finish in
[01:22:32] most the catch yup and for emblem lastly
[01:22:35] but not least Lee Rosaria
[01:22:38] foreign
[01:22:43] not bad geared uh lastly Rosaria geared
[01:22:48] she has zero em I could give her
[01:22:50] dragon's vein
[01:22:51] because we're probably gonna be reverse
[01:22:53] melting
[01:22:55] um
[01:22:57] but we're gonna do Fab
[01:23:05] yeah
[01:23:07] so yeah we're actually geared
[01:23:10] uh the last thing I I just remembered I
[01:23:12] wanted to do is get my talent up which I
[01:23:14] can do let me go to a crafting table and
[01:23:16] do that no yeah melt okay here's the
[01:23:19] thing in Reverse mouth Rosaria melts but
[01:23:21] also like half the time the enemies get
[01:23:24] like cryoed and then you usually want to
[01:23:26] start with Rosaria to give crit rate to
[01:23:28] your other characters so then like some
[01:23:29] of your bursticks are cryo and then
[01:23:31] they're not melting and then it ends up
[01:23:33] being like a lot of wasted like it's
[01:23:35] like in theory she's the one melting but
[01:23:37] like unless you start on changling or
[01:23:39] like Bennett Chang Ling it's like you
[01:23:40] miss a few melts so I don't really care
[01:23:41] about em that much like you still want
[01:23:43] some but I don't know in my experience
[01:23:45] it's like I'm not melting like that much
[01:23:49] I don't know you probably still want to
[01:23:50] go like I probably still would go
[01:23:51] dragon's vein there but is there is
[01:23:57] wait what else I need to craft I need to
[01:23:59] craft the blue ones right how many do I
[01:24:00] need
[01:24:09] I got one bonus
[01:24:15] I go
[01:24:21] sign
[01:24:35] our chat it is now time to enter the
[01:24:37] brand new 4.1 Abyss we're gonna clear it
[01:24:40] first try we can gamble and if I'll do
[01:24:42] it all with no deaths which I will uh
[01:24:44] and then we'll do a four-star team and
[01:24:46] then maybe test some teams out if it's
[01:24:48] easy we might stay here less if it's
[01:24:49] hard we might stay here more we might
[01:24:52] get hard we'll do what we do and we'll
[01:24:54] see how it goes
[01:24:58] this is pretty [ __ ] broken for uh
[01:25:00] Nevada
[01:25:02] why doesn't it also give plunge attack
[01:25:04] damage that is weird all good
[01:25:10] is 11 new
[01:25:14] oh yeah it is the [ __ ] is this

[01:25:40] and then Mira made it oh my God
[01:25:43] that's the other one okay yeah
[01:25:51] okay first off is Sac second half is the
[01:25:54] new enemy which makes you plunge attack
[01:25:56] right so
[01:25:57] that'd be cool
[01:25:59] okay
[01:26:07] uh one second shot

[01:32:14] there is a hole of this floor
[01:32:16] takes the fun out no I think it's fun so
[01:32:19] like it like I think it's fun but like
[01:32:22] imagine changing your mouse sensitivity
[01:32:25] to play a game like how do I explain
[01:32:27] this it's like I feel like that fox is
[01:32:29] like your like Mouse control
[01:32:31] like you're no longer used to anything
[01:32:33] this is weird
[01:32:43] says the valoran player yeah but I'm not
[01:32:45] switching my [ __ ] sensitivity every
[01:32:46] game
[01:32:49] also
[01:32:50] I don't know
[01:32:53] I guess you could use a controller wait
[01:32:54] does it work with a controller that
[01:32:56] would be kind of lit
[01:33:00] but I kind of want to try with the
[01:33:01] controller
[01:33:08] you
[01:33:10] controller sends his dog [ __ ] yeah but
[01:33:12] like okay also how big does your mouse
[01:33:14] pad have to be to [ __ ] I mean I guess
[01:33:16] if your DPI is like a million you don't
[01:33:18] need a big mouse pad but
[01:33:23] why is this stream lagging is it that
[01:33:25] might be on your end
[01:33:27] hopefully it's not
[01:33:41] they could see zeros saved donated ten
[01:33:43] dollars

[01:34:20] sickness I don't want to do this but I I
[01:34:24] might as well
[01:34:26] okay uh

[01:35:45] middle sorry
[01:35:48] silence
[01:35:55] okay I mean I don't recommend doing this
[01:35:59] to your eyes or to your mouse but it's
[01:36:01] it's pretty funny
[01:36:03] then it works
[01:36:05] wait can I charge back what's happening
[01:36:10] I need once I have to wait I have to
[01:36:11] wait

[01:36:57] glad I did it
[01:37:04] are like yeah that's actually optimal
[01:37:07] I mean I guess it is if you are okay

[01:37:22] your journey ends here I mean to be fair
[01:37:25] you can like no you can't you actually
[01:37:27] need high sense because it hits eight
[01:37:30] times in what four seconds three seconds
[01:37:33] it's three wait it's point eight point
[01:37:35] eight point yeah three seconds right
[01:37:39] down so you attack every like it's a
[01:37:41] tick of damage uh uh I was gonna say
[01:37:45] three per second but that would be nine
[01:37:47] so yeah around there
[01:37:49] silence
[01:38:01] same as Jean wait what no
[01:38:06] what do you mean same as wrongly
[01:38:09] like drawing the charge attack
[01:38:15] I'm gonna be honest I can't name a
[01:38:17] single person who's Zhang Li charge
[01:38:19] attacked E Yeah but jungle is e doesn't
[01:38:27] okay
[01:38:31] it's like one two three four five no
[01:38:34] it's like
[01:38:37] like that's a lot faster than drawing
[01:38:38] these
[01:38:47] that's gonna hurt [ __ ] I don't have
[01:38:49] fires on the wrist
[01:38:54] s
[01:38:55] [Music]
[01:38:56] people conquering
[01:39:00] cheer
[01:39:05] well he's one per second right probably
[01:39:07] that sounds right
[01:39:11] is it I actually feel like I feel like
[01:39:13] it's probably one per second because
[01:39:14] they usually make things one per second
[01:39:15] but in my mind it's slower than that so
[01:39:17] maybe I don't actually know let me check
[01:39:20] I mean usually it just [ __ ] you up
[01:39:21] anyways like you don't actually want the
[01:39:22] Geo uh
[01:39:30] why doesn't it
[01:39:31] why doesn't it tell you
[01:39:43] [ __ ] we're gonna count
[01:39:49] sure
[01:39:55] yo this is
[01:40:00] this is pretty [ __ ] slow
[01:40:06] this is not one second
[01:40:09] look count with me
[01:40:11] One Mississippi two Mississippi three
[01:40:16] maybe I'm counting too slow maybe not
[01:40:17] counting too fast I mean you could just
[01:40:19] record it and count but it's
[01:40:22] 2.5 I mean I could check
[01:40:25] I'm sure the Frame data is on kqm
[01:40:28] have you ever considered a career in
[01:40:30] voice acting
[01:40:34] I remember what [ __ ] me up as we
[01:40:36] didn't know at the start that it had
[01:40:38] that drawing was the first instance of
[01:40:39] me realizing that particle generation
[01:40:41] can be random because I thought well as
[01:40:44] a Jeff also thought that drawing these
[01:40:46] pillar every time it hit generated a
[01:40:47] particle but it's actually a 50 chance
[01:40:49] which is uh an XD moment so
[01:41:01] all right floor eleven should I play a
[01:41:04] real team we could just solo nebula
[01:41:05] again we'll put them first half though
[01:41:12] yo Ralph there's a 27. damn
[01:41:18] we're ready second half we have a cryo
[01:41:21] damage on us
[01:41:25] foreign
[01:41:27] balls
[01:41:30] Rosaria
[01:41:33] shangling Bennett
[01:41:38] it was 0.75 right wait who's Jean Lee
[01:41:40] pretty sure Zhang's just 50 50 isn't it
[01:41:44] uh I'm literally on the page right now
[01:41:45] let me check
[01:41:50] in my PM uh
[01:41:53] yeah 50 that's 50
[01:41:59] .
[01:42:00] be sanctified
[01:42:02] let's be my lucky day today
[01:42:07] bro what is this range
[01:42:36] first am I stupid Maybe
[01:42:47] let's light it up let's Light It Up
[01:42:56] bro where are you going
[01:42:59] that kayaber's lasted six years
[01:43:07] Oh wait we're supposed to play our new
[01:43:10] playlist
[01:43:12] I'm sorry I need to calm down I need I
[01:43:14] don't know why I'm so loud today
[01:43:17] I made an entire musical journey and we
[01:43:19] didn't play it
[01:43:25] I'm playing it now
[01:43:27] on with Shuffle off
[01:43:32] about your head
[01:43:39] well I don't have my burst so we're
[01:43:40] gonna charge up manually
[01:43:42] please don't interrupt me please don't
[01:43:43] interrupt me
[01:43:53] be humble
[01:43:56] huh
[01:44:01] part of me wants to see one part of me
[01:44:03] doesn't
[01:44:07] so I probably won't get it but I do
[01:44:09] think it would be convenient
[01:44:15] but this guy's all dead
[01:44:23] why did that guy spawn so far he was
[01:44:26] literally all the way here
[01:44:28] if there's only one enemy why are you so
[01:44:30] far what are you afraid of
[01:44:34] unnecessary yeah I agree but it's also
[01:44:36] cool like I like to see ones that are
[01:44:38] fun or like
[01:44:39] convenient
[01:44:41] that are like nice and spicy nice and
[01:44:43] spicy
[01:44:44] but yeah
[01:44:48] lights out
[01:44:50] judgment
[01:44:51] cool it
[01:44:55] get it
[01:44:58] photos already got it but
[01:45:06] of course
[01:45:07] far any good okay I don't know if this
[01:45:09] is like bait because strangling but yes
[01:45:10] C4 strangling is amazing
[01:45:13] her best constellation very good very
[01:45:15] good
[01:45:18] the Ty's beckon
[01:45:35] I know there's more
[01:45:44] nothing mighty be humble
[01:45:47] be not perturbed I am unscathed
[01:45:54] all right
[01:45:57] is R1 sax art on Central fine if I don't
[01:45:59] have fav
[01:46:00] R1 sack sword
[01:46:03] I mean yes
[01:46:06] if you have a good sword like okay if
[01:46:09] you have like five if you have a good
[01:46:11] like five star like if you have a weapon
[01:46:12] that has good stats on it you can do
[01:46:14] that with an ER sense if not you can use
[01:46:16] a low refined sack because it's what
[01:46:18] it's still like okay you'll get it every
[01:46:20] two rotations instead of every rotation
[01:46:22] assuming you actually proc the effect
[01:46:24] because it's just a chance
[01:46:26] it's okay
[01:46:28] this character is insane it's unreal
[01:46:29] yeah I'm telling you the only reason I I
[01:46:32] didn't put broken in the thumbnails
[01:46:34] because I put it for the last video
[01:46:36] I think it's really good but also like
[01:46:38] don't feel forced to get up because like
[01:46:40] the Hydra archon's coming I'm so sorry
[01:46:43] but he is very good
[01:46:46] I can't like a lot of the times I'm like
[01:46:48] I don't like judging a character early
[01:46:51] dude what are these enemies
[01:46:55] Rosary is dead Rosario is dead
[01:46:59] freeze
[01:47:01] frostbite
[01:47:09] bro these enemies actually are no joke
[01:47:11] what the [ __ ]
[01:47:14] dude what
[01:47:16] we almost died
[01:47:19] but yeah I usually don't like commenting
[01:47:20] on power level too early but like
[01:47:23] even before he came out when I first got
[01:47:24] to play him I was like this character's
[01:47:26] broken and then I played him like I
[01:47:27] played him I'm like he's broken and then
[01:47:29] I came out and I'm like yeah he's broken
[01:47:32] usually okay usually I'm but like
[01:47:35] subject to change right because like
[01:47:37] it's still early but I do think it's
[01:47:39] really good also he's not needed
[01:47:42] also
[01:47:45] um
[01:47:47] usually the amount like usually my feel
[01:47:50] for a character day one and when I get
[01:47:53] to play him for the first time
[01:47:55] isn't the same as how good he is but
[01:47:58] gives me a good idea of how good the
[01:48:00] character
[01:48:03] hmm it gives me like a good like
[01:48:06] bracket of like how good they are like
[01:48:08] example is like
[01:48:12] when a character is like really good or
[01:48:14] really broken I have no trouble clearing
[01:48:16] and it's like super smooth and it's like
[01:48:17] really easy and happy whereas other
[01:48:19] times it's like
[01:48:21] I'll put like
[01:48:23] sometimes the abyss dog [ __ ] like
[01:48:24] sometimes I know what character is
[01:48:25] decent but the abyss is really bad for
[01:48:27] them
[01:48:27] uh but other times it's like
[01:48:30] like when Ryden came out she was like
[01:48:32] she's good but like the abyss was so bad
[01:48:34] for her and it was like hard to actually
[01:48:36] test her when scarra came out Not only
[01:48:38] was the abyss [ __ ] annoying but also
[01:48:40] I was playing him c0 with a c0 farazon
[01:48:42] and it was just the most disgusting is
[01:48:44] so annoying but the abyss is also
[01:48:46] [ __ ] annoying so
[01:48:48] but that doesn't mean he's bad it's just
[01:48:49] like annoying to play
[01:48:58] Pearl seahorse rip towns
[01:49:00] some stuff durgo capella that one's the
[01:49:02] anima one right so you can probably just
[01:49:04] swirl it
[01:49:05] and then mere mated when operative and
[01:49:07] the field generator
[01:49:21] he's bad though huskara scar is like
[01:49:23] flying motherless Hazel which is fine
[01:49:25] there's nothing wrong with that there's
[01:49:27] nothing wrong with that he's good you
[01:49:29] know you can Dash around and [ __ ]
[01:49:32] told me to watch
[01:49:37] used for some time and I've recently
[01:49:39] been in a very dark place so I am here
[01:49:43] I'll dance
[01:49:46] I thought it was a troll he said my mom
[01:49:48] told me to watch you but
[01:49:49] I'm glad I can
[01:49:52] help
[01:49:59] not not a life on you but
[01:50:02] don't worry chatter things always get
[01:50:04] better
[01:50:05] they do they do they actually do it I
[01:50:07] know a lot of my friends like a lot of
[01:50:08] people because okay
[01:50:12] I don't talk about this much but like
[01:50:13] I've dealt with a lot and also a lot of
[01:50:15] my friends have dealt with a lot I don't
[01:50:17] know why maybe it's because I mean ciao
[01:50:18] I attract [ __ ]
[01:50:20] yeah anyways but like it always gets
[01:50:23] better don't worry
[01:50:24] it does it does it does
[01:50:30] but uh don't
[01:50:33] yeah it gets worse LOL
[01:50:38] no it doesn't
[01:50:41] well it does it like it does temporarily
[01:50:43] but like long term it gets better it
[01:50:44] always does worst case cause dude
[01:50:46] sometimes it's like dude what okay like
[01:50:48] it's like you look at like
[01:50:50] dude [ __ ] like suicide rates in med
[01:50:53] school are super high and then you have
[01:50:54] to think like wow that's because okay
[01:50:55] these people have like huge expectations
[01:50:57] for themselves and then [ __ ] goes wrong
[01:50:58] and like there's like expectations and
[01:51:01] stuff it's like dude who cares about all
[01:51:02] that [ __ ] I believe in you like we've
[01:51:05] all had our time you don't have to like
[01:51:06] to some extent long like let's say long
[01:51:09] term like short term you're like [ __ ]
[01:51:11] everything sucks I'm failing my med
[01:51:12] school I'm not gonna be a doctor my
[01:51:13] parents are gonna hate me but then it's
[01:51:14] like
[01:51:15] years go by and you do other [ __ ] then
[01:51:17] you're happy with another job and you're
[01:51:19] cool and then it's like yeah it got
[01:51:21] better whereas if it's like if you're
[01:51:22] just like full Agony because one thing
[01:51:25] goes wrong it's like it'll just get
[01:51:26] worse
[01:51:28] forehead just don't care I mean
[01:51:34] I don't know
[01:51:36] I don't know
[01:51:40] Oh wait we're supposed to do a gamble
[01:51:42] wait I can't play strongly if we're
[01:51:44] gambling I can't that's cheating
[01:51:52] as a pre-med thank you
[01:51:55] I mean it depends what type of person
[01:51:56] you are like I was in law school but I
[01:51:58] wasn't like stressed about it like
[01:51:59] obviously it's like I need to make sure
[01:52:01] I do good I don't [ __ ] you know but
[01:52:03] like
[01:52:04] it's different between like I I had
[01:52:06] friends that would literally like
[01:52:07] substance abuse just to like
[01:52:09] I don't know I feel like if you're
[01:52:11] ruining your life for a degree it's like
[01:52:15] what are you doing well I mean I get it
[01:52:19] I mean I have like I don't know like I'm
[01:52:21] lucky like I recognize the the privilege
[01:52:24] of having parents that are like you can
[01:52:25] do what you want but also like
[01:52:28] in a Lebanese family for me at least
[01:52:30] it's like you're a doctor you're a
[01:52:31] lawyer you're an engineer
[01:52:33] or like maybe at like a taxi driver if
[01:52:36] you're like hustling or you're a failure
[01:52:37] it's like but yeah I don't know I don't
[01:52:40] really agree with that
[01:52:45] I don't know
[01:52:47] all right anyways we're gonna
[01:52:51] yeah
[01:52:53] like I had a I had a cousin who was in
[01:52:55] med school and then it was like
[01:52:58] I don't know it just wasn't good
[01:52:59] mentally for them so they dropped out
[01:53:01] and then they did Pharmacy and now
[01:53:02] they're like super happy as a pharmacist
[01:53:05] and living a good life so it's like
[01:53:09] I don't know
[01:53:14] all right we're gonna here's what we're
[01:53:15] gonna do we're gonna do
[01:53:16] a new set right now if that's gonna be
[01:53:18] second half person that's gonna be Shout
[01:53:20] far is on Ben 10
[01:53:23] and then I don't know who the last law
[01:53:24] is gonna be we're gonna solo and every
[01:53:26] last second wait I shouldn't do this on
[01:53:28] my first try though right I don't know
[01:53:29] how to dodge this
[01:53:31] with me am I happy shut up [ __ ] you that
[01:53:33] I don't matter
[01:53:36] it doesn't matter look I don't need to
[01:53:38] think about that
[01:53:40] but yeah I mean I am I'm fine really
[01:53:42] names in 20 months
[01:53:52] please use wrongly but if I use wrongly
[01:53:54] it's too easy it's too free I need there
[01:53:56] to be some element of oh what if zox
[01:53:58] dies and loses
[01:54:04] you matter no okay I I know I'm not
[01:54:06] trying to be like I'm not trying to seek
[01:54:08] I know I'm just saying like

[01:54:21] please level [ __ ] we'll play Dale
[01:54:24] okay this is our first team this is our
[01:54:26] second team

[01:54:32] some Er
[01:54:36] am I new villette I have like zero yeah
[01:54:41] I think you're fine because I don't I
[01:54:43] don't expect this enemy to generate
[01:54:44] particles for me and neither will this
[01:54:46] one I don't think I don't know I haven't
[01:54:48] really fought them but I don't think
[01:54:50] they will okay we'll get a bit of ER
[01:54:55] foreign
[01:55:08] off yes but if you have engulfing
[01:55:10] lightning you want more ER because you
[01:55:12] go engulfing an emblem and then you can
[01:55:13] get more and then you might as well get
[01:55:15] like 350 400 so yeah all right first
[01:55:16] half we're gonna do show faruzan

[02:07:45] seconds on the first half that wasn't my
[02:07:47] fault okay look look I might give it to
[02:07:50] doubters right sure but that was
[02:07:52] actually not my fault we just had no
[02:07:54] burst
[02:07:59] okay look let's see how we're supposed
[02:08:01] to funnel because how the [ __ ] do we
[02:08:03] even
[02:08:04] like shout as we get his burst from that
[02:08:12] maybe if you use an actual battery
[02:08:13] instead of Daya
[02:08:15] can you imagine if Dale was Toma with
[02:08:17] favs
[02:08:24] I mean it's not an ER problem it's that
[02:08:26] we started with nothing no no energy
[02:08:29] it's not about that we have one two five
[02:08:31] VR right now which is like normal for
[02:08:33] sure
[02:08:34] it's just that we started with nothing
[02:08:35] here
[02:08:37] oh [ __ ] okay whatever
[02:08:40] I'll give it to doubters but you don't
[02:08:41] deserve it we're gonna run it back we're
[02:08:43] gonna run it back
[02:08:45] run it back second try second this is
[02:08:46] the first try though
[02:08:57] one chamber I thought you're gonna clear
[02:08:58] okay if we actually funneled particles
[02:09:01] to show and started with burst we it
[02:09:02] would have been easy if I had child
[02:09:04] burst at the start we'd have had it
[02:09:24] I mean we also could have played [ __ ]
[02:09:26] Al Haytham by the way we could have just
[02:09:27] out heightened
[02:09:33] okay okay
[02:09:35] if I [ __ ] up my particles I'm allowed to
[02:09:37] reset though new rule

[02:10:35] scam if I if I if I kept going okay can
[02:10:38] I group them by like going here no it
[02:10:40] would be a scam if I it would be a scam
[02:10:42] if I like if that counted the people are

[02:10:46] betting I you can't start when people

[02:27:51] it's okay I didn't need those droplets
[02:27:53] anyways
[02:27:54] I didn't need the six droplets I just
[02:27:57] wasted can't wait for the YouTube
[02:27:59] comments to be like haha this guy this
[02:28:01] guy doesn't know how to play in the
[02:28:03] villain
[02:28:07] stop settle down
[02:28:12] the tides beckon
[02:28:26] okay so far so good even though we
[02:28:28] missed six droplets our damage is still
[02:28:30] good because never let is [ __ ] broken
[02:28:33] he is busted and he will make you bust
[02:28:35] what
[02:28:41] are you lying
[02:28:46] dude I used it
[02:28:50] it's Auto targeting man
[02:28:57] where's my burst where's my burst can I
[02:29:00] have my burst can I have my birth
[02:29:03] that was a dummy I'm sorry that was
[02:29:06] actually a dummy me stopping to press e
[02:29:07] was dumb that was dumb that was dumb I
[02:29:10] admit it though I learned from my
[02:29:11] mistake watch that won't happen again no
[02:29:13] sorry it won't no sorry it won't it's
[02:29:16] not about though you can't make mistakes
[02:29:18] it's about learning from them and not
[02:29:20] repeating them uh fool me once shame on
[02:29:23] you fool me twice shame on me
[02:29:26] first try
[02:29:28] not really the first try but it should
[02:29:30] have been first try we just got lucky or
[02:29:31] whatever but basically first try sold it
[02:29:33] for that too
[02:29:35] oh zox what's your name in that build
[02:29:36] I'm curious oh thanks real person that I
[02:29:39] didn't make up let me show you in case
[02:29:41] you're wondering so our nebula is uh
[02:29:43] level 90 with level nine seven seven so
[02:29:46] you know like room for improvement uh he
[02:29:48] is on a signature weapon c0 four piece
[02:29:53] uh and normally so I put 22 ER on my
[02:29:56] goblet here because we're solo we need
[02:29:58] more energy than normal but typically
[02:29:59] with goblet I don't need that much
[02:30:00] energy so I go for this goblet instead
[02:30:03] uh this circlet this sends uh flower
[02:30:07] feather you know it is what it is this
[02:30:09] is our ratio right now usually we have
[02:30:10] 300 crit damage but we were playing him
[02:30:12] solo so we don't
[02:30:14] uh let me switch back to his normal
[02:30:15] build uh uh uh right meow wait where is
[02:30:18] it I don't know it's I using I was using
[02:30:21] this one yes so this is what we're
[02:30:23] normally on but yeah
[02:30:40] nice first try can I get my points back
[02:30:42] I'm I'm sorry
[02:30:44] HP circular could be better without
[02:30:46] hiker damage okay but why would I care
[02:30:48] like look at me in the eyes and be like
[02:30:51] explain why I should care like I'm being
[02:30:53] honest it's like ayaka Miss splitter
[02:30:55] right it's like okay you can go like
[02:30:56] attack like circles okay okay the same
[02:30:59] as that but like why
[02:31:04] also trust when when Farina comes out
[02:31:07] surely they'll be good together then I
[02:31:09] have hydro resonance and then we could
[02:31:11] run them together
[02:31:14] it's also probably well it's not
[02:31:16] probably it is so it's not dependent do
[02:31:18] I have a good HP one
[02:31:20] Maybe
[02:31:23] oh I mean that could be good
[02:31:25] that also could be good I'm actually
[02:31:27] down to roll this [ __ ] it whatever
[02:31:29] I'm not gonna use it because I'd rather
[02:31:31] just have a big crew damage number
[02:31:32] because it looks funny granted by Elon
[02:31:34] uses HP you might not know this but my
[02:31:36] lawn does use an HP uh circuit so I am
[02:31:38] an HP Android
[02:31:59] try keep it though I mean it could roll
[02:32:02] it could technically no I'm not gonna
[02:32:04] use it
[02:32:06] foreign
[02:32:08] this is better it's better because
[02:32:10] there's er er role goes a long way
[02:32:14] so it's technically better
[02:32:18] it's technically better because there's
[02:32:20] an ER role and er matters
[02:32:24] it's not all about size it's about the
[02:32:26] motion of the ocean
[02:32:27] granted like it's a mix of both but you
[02:32:30] know it's not just ER it's not just crit
[02:32:33] you know okay
[02:32:35] um
[02:32:41] anyways maybe we'll go HP circular one
[02:32:44] day but I'd rather Flex my crit damage
[02:32:45] so true
[02:32:53] what is he blabbering about
[02:32:56] no way you said blabbering that's not
[02:32:59] even a word people use that's not even a
[02:33:01] word people use
[02:33:07] nearly build revealed did my nilu is so
[02:33:09] good you guys actually don't know how
[02:33:11] good my nilo is you guys forget you guys
[02:33:14] forget that I'm the nilu god they call
[02:33:17] me nulu God in my hometown they call me

[02:33:24] oh you're calling for me coming time for
[02:33:27] a house call
[02:33:29] us with Hydra resonance 62k right then
[02:33:32] like her normal team you have higher
[02:33:33] resonance dull blade level one talents
[02:33:36] but look at look at these pieces 20 hp
[02:33:38] on set 20 hp on set 12 HP HP HP
[02:33:45] true

[02:34:14] you did you level your nilu
[02:34:17] if I
[02:34:18] just
[02:34:27] if I remove all of my artifacts okay
[02:34:30] maybe not that was a bit ambitious but
[02:34:32] like it was close Okay I could probably
[02:34:35] remove like half of them
[02:34:39] what was my circlet I don't remember it
[02:34:41] was millith right
[02:34:48] it's not HP main stop that's all you

[02:45:28] I never opened the bookstore I listened
[02:45:30] to you Sue's [ __ ] Lou I listened to
[02:45:33] lose soon's [ __ ] stories
[02:45:35] I got the achievement today
[02:45:49] Chad you want to know my deepest darkest
[02:45:51] secret you know in patch 1.0 before I
[02:45:54] actually made videos I think I might
[02:45:55] have made like only one video I mean
[02:45:56] like the deluke video that's it like I
[02:45:58] had like or like battle pass post like
[02:46:00] I've had like three videos I was
[02:46:02] debating making I was debating making a
[02:46:05] food tier list because I thought food
[02:46:07] was gonna be important in the end game
[02:46:09] when we got raids and stuff I am not
[02:46:11] kidding I'm not joking by the way I was
[02:46:13] gonna go through every food and figure
[02:46:15] out like what the most efficient ones to
[02:46:17] craft are and how good they are and and
[02:46:20] yeah
[02:46:21] yeah yeah we both know how that went
[02:46:25] surely raids dude they're like like fake
[02:46:27] leaks of like oh eight player race are
[02:46:29] coming
[02:46:34] yeah
[02:46:36] yeah
[02:46:37] I used to farm crabs I used to farm
[02:46:40] crabs I used to farm crabs for adepticey
[02:46:45] Temptations
[02:46:47] these
[02:46:53] do it as a meme
[02:47:08] Mega milk mommy these are five months
[02:47:10] what
[02:47:11] oh those are still muted for a second
[02:47:13] but I appreciate it
[02:47:19] food TC is crazy ah there have been
[02:47:22] crazier things tc'd
[02:47:26] I saw a personality sized tier list I
[02:47:30] saw a
[02:47:31] have you seen a [ __ ] ushi rotation
[02:47:41] someone said Sonic's viewer TC and then
[02:47:43] in parentheses I'm a meta that's not a
[02:47:46] thing
[02:47:50] taser DPS is crazier
[02:47:54] yeah yeah finding out who electrocharges
[02:47:56] and how much percentage of your damage
[02:47:58] is electrocharge and also who is
[02:47:59] blooming in a new Bloom team never ask a
[02:48:02] nilu player who is blooming
[02:48:05] especially if there's no kokomi
[02:48:07] especially if the team looks like
[02:48:08] [ __ ]
[02:48:13] well I guess you'd like to call me here
[02:48:15] but yeah
[02:48:17] maybe not what if you're doing this who
[02:48:18] the [ __ ]
[02:48:25] oh should we played the Luke virgin no
[02:48:28] but dude what would I even I mean dude
[02:48:30] looks fine first like against this guy
[02:48:32] probably good here probably
[02:48:37] the loop could probably work here
[02:48:41] well the team you play Candace
[02:48:43] yeah true actually Candace yaoyao is a
[02:48:45] thing I probably need to play that
[02:49:00] okay what would my four star teams be
[02:49:03] I would definitely play 16-18 on the
[02:49:06] witch house
[02:49:12] first and then
[02:49:15] aggravate second probably so we would
[02:49:18] probably do if we're playing four star
[02:49:20] teams we would probably play
[02:49:23] uh Rosaria Caius Maximus shangling
[02:49:28] Bennett and then second half we would do
[02:49:34] probably aggravate so we would do like
[02:49:36] sucrose official Beto and then yeah
[02:49:43] good work
[02:49:46] um
[02:49:47] yeah I mean I like this here I think
[02:49:48] this would work pretty well Beto uh is
[02:49:51] really really really really really good
[02:49:52] against a lot of enemies or at least two
[02:49:55] but here against single Target and here
[02:49:57] against single Target there could be I
[02:50:00] mean we could also use Synchro
[02:50:09] could also just electrocharge like taser
[02:50:14] Hydro for pyro Shields oh yeah yeah
[02:50:16] there's pyrobist Majors yeah we want
[02:50:17] some show we could do either
[02:50:18] electrocharge or Salad which would be
[02:50:21] chucking some dendro in there
[02:50:22] unfortunately yaoyo doesn't have the
[02:50:24] most danger app except when she's on
[02:50:25] field uh we could play dendro MC
[02:50:32] we could also
[02:50:34] DMC and kooky
[02:50:39] but I kind of don't like kooky as much
[02:50:41] as official here I think official's
[02:50:44] damage is really high
[02:50:52] DMC is a five star I mean
[02:50:58] okay we'll play official with a bit more
[02:51:00] I mean wait sucrose is gonna be hyper
[02:51:02] blooming what am I saying I'm [ __ ]
[02:51:04] stupid I forgot we're playing sucrose
[02:51:05] was just gonna hyper them everything
[02:51:06] yeah we're fine
[02:51:19] how to beat Hydro Phantasm I'm razor
[02:51:22] brained you mean like an 11-3 yeah
[02:51:25] they're annoying
[02:51:30] okay wait if we're playing hype
[02:51:34] uh deepwood because right now she is on
[02:51:36] instructor
[02:51:37] which is good for aggravate
[02:51:44] uh we'll give her
[02:51:47] five lats
[02:51:54] and we'll go deep wood
[02:52:07] filter by Deep wood we're gonna steal
[02:52:11] um
[02:52:12] we're gonna take every by jar no wait
[02:52:14] nevermind he's on ER what the [ __ ] baiju
[02:52:16] what are you doing
[02:52:18] okay we'll take care of our pieces
[02:52:20] whatever
[02:52:29] your five is level one I mean we don't
[02:52:30] really need yahweal burst
[02:52:33] it's nice for healing it's I mean we
[02:52:35] probably want the more dendro actually
[02:52:36] yeah okay fine
[02:52:42] the catch
[02:52:44] what should I give her
[02:52:48] honestly level one's probably [ __ ]
[02:52:49] fine do I have enough crit rate
[02:53:11] okay
[02:53:20] I'm gonna give dragons me to Rosaria
[02:53:23] and we're gonna five lines on yao yao
[02:53:25] and then Rosario might need a little bit
[02:53:26] of ER
[02:53:28] I mean well our team cop generates a lot
[02:53:30] of energy we probably don't need a lot
[02:53:31] we might need a little
[02:53:38] well I think we'll be fine
[02:53:49] I'll be fine
[02:53:54] it's been three hours and this guy's
[02:53:56] done nothing excuse you I literally
[02:53:59] cleared the business like [ __ ]
[02:54:07] okay we're gonna [ __ ] you
[02:54:10] hey we're now gonna do four star clears
[02:54:13] wow so looking at the enemy what am I
[02:54:15] doing
[02:54:17] okay here's the teams we're gonna play
[02:54:19] we already went through it we need uh
[02:54:21] just Hydro second half we need something
[02:54:22] to deal with this first half and then
[02:54:24] the rest is pretty straightforward so
[02:54:26] we're gonna play uh our standard Four
[02:54:28] Star team
[02:54:30] Rosaria Kaya reverse melts you play them
[02:54:33] uh with Bennett
[02:54:34] and shangling and then you have a really
[02:54:38] strong Forza team SEC and this also is a
[02:54:40] shangling team that allows you to
[02:54:41] preserve your Saint Joe for the second
[02:54:42] one very easy very accessible characters
[02:54:45] second off we're gonna play either
[02:54:46] aggravate taser or salad for me I'm
[02:54:49] gonna choose the salad the healthy
[02:54:50] option uh we're gonna put sucrose here
[02:54:52] with Fishel and uh we're gonna
[02:54:55] hyperbloom through Synchro and then
[02:54:57] dendro MC if we don't need a Healer but
[02:54:59] I'm a baby so we're gonna put yao yao
[02:55:01] also dendrons he's technically a five
[02:55:02] star also that doesn't really matter
[02:55:04] though also uh we're gonna have no den
[02:55:06] drop but it is what it is all right
[02:55:07] let's go
[02:55:09] also all of our characters on four star
[02:55:11] weapons I think
[02:55:15] it should be dragon's vein black Cliff
[02:55:18] catch sapwood sack uh uh Catalyst like
[02:55:23] fragment stringless
[02:55:27] sack
[02:55:28] fav
[02:55:37] okay this is useless here but all of
[02:55:40] them are useless
[02:55:41] I mean this is good but temporary normal
[02:55:44] shock damage doesn't really matter
[02:55:47] foreign
[02:56:08] really good really good we're gonna pick
[02:56:10] up the pepper although we didn't
[02:56:11] snapshot it but it is what it is
[02:56:13] we break the shield Rosario needs a bit
[02:56:16] more ER but fine
[02:56:18] freeze
[02:56:20] give some particles to shangling
[02:56:23] DreamWork shiver
[02:56:25] I need my power needle here can I get it
[02:56:27] I don't have it that's unlucky
[02:56:32] pick that up
[02:56:35] okay
[02:56:36] uh you can't run this is still fine we
[02:56:39] messed up well we didn't really mess up
[02:56:41] but our energy like was not ideal
[02:56:45] final it's fine this is still really
[02:56:47] good damage I was trying to save some
[02:56:49] birds for next Taps this don't die
[02:56:51] please okay we have we have our Bruce
[02:56:53] basically yeah we're good nice
[02:57:00] yeah but like our first weren't lined up
[02:57:03] it happens it is what it is also if you
[02:57:04] shangling first and Rosario melts more
[02:57:05] but you're supposed to Rosario first but
[02:57:07] also no one asked
[02:57:13] okay
[02:57:15] I'm not on throwing tail so I can kind
[02:57:16] of just chill uh I think we're gonna do
[02:57:20] okay
[02:57:23] this Auto this Auto yo yo
[02:57:30] oh
[02:57:31] [Music]
[02:57:32] dude look at all those numbers
[02:57:35] I'm sorry if the bitter is getting
[02:57:36] [ __ ] but that has to be satisfied
[02:57:41] look at this this
[02:57:43] let me read you a purse
[02:57:46] hopefully the bitrate isn't uh terrible
[02:57:48] right now
[02:57:56] I mean so far so good this is like we
[02:57:58] can't really see what's going on but I
[02:57:59] know that things are dying and that's
[02:58:01] good
[02:58:04] we have a lot of chords we can't really
[02:58:06] Bloom right now
[02:58:07] you want sucrose to be hyperbooming them
[02:58:15] okay I could probably go to a wall and
[02:58:17] make these guys teleport
[02:58:19] uh do I want to do that right now sure
[02:58:21] we'll do that
[02:58:25] nice okay on all my bursts
[02:58:31] rain cutter time to act let me just make
[02:58:34] sure this guy doesn't get his shield
[02:58:35] back there you go
[02:58:41] but it is
[02:58:42] [Music]
[02:58:43] damage doesn't really matter here we
[02:58:45] have enough
[02:59:01] there you go
[02:59:05] Yaya needs tenacity
[02:59:09] uh you can use uh uh what is it called
[02:59:12] the deepwood because you're the only
[02:59:14] dungeer there
[02:59:27] lights out
[02:59:29] frostbite
[02:59:48] okay this time I'll actually Rosaria
[02:59:50] bursts first so we give criterate to
[02:59:52] other characters to do that then we
[02:59:54] shangling then we guiloba then we balls
[03:00:00] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[03:00:02] I'm sorry
[03:00:04] dude calm down at least wait I died
[03:00:08] what the [ __ ]
[03:00:12] I was all good
[03:00:18] if she's only dendro she's knocking
[03:00:21] damage isn't deepwood not as good
[03:00:22] genuine question for you okay
[03:00:24] that is true and aggravate because in
[03:00:26] aggravate all your damage is Electro but
[03:00:29] in hyperbloom hyperloom is danger damage
[03:00:31] well it's yeah it's under damage so
[03:00:34] reducing the dangerous of enemies
[03:00:35] matters so if you're like hyper blue or
[03:00:37] virgin or blue t-pud even if your dendro
[03:00:40] character sucks balls
[03:00:42] makes it do more damage
[03:00:48] freeze no no no no sorry okay we're
[03:00:51] gonna do this so we can snapshot
[03:00:52] everything Rosaria next to criterate
[03:00:54] buffer team then shangling
[03:00:56] the enemy's already got split up that's
[03:00:58] not great but they're gonna come back
[03:00:59] together so that's fine I'm not just
[03:01:01] swap there I didn't swap I don't know
[03:01:03] why
[03:01:03] capture particles on Rosaria okay do
[03:01:05] this Bennett E I miss the E how do you
[03:01:08] miss a bennity how do you miss calm down
[03:01:10] calm down okay it's just a game
[03:01:13] bennettling catch on check link our
[03:01:16] shangling has no energy because we
[03:01:17] didn't catch on changling I said to do
[03:01:19] something and then I didn't do it uh you
[03:01:20] are grounded for a week young man fine
[03:01:23] freeze oh so we're gonna bend it all
[03:01:26] tears swap I mean e swap the shangling
[03:01:28] cap the energy pyronado and now we win
[03:01:31] uh ideally we funnel some particles
[03:01:33] before ending though let me catch them
[03:01:35] on changling
[03:01:36] well unfortunately our damage is too
[03:01:38] high but that was pretty good
[03:01:44] uh what's happening second half it's the
[03:01:46] the dancers okay
[03:01:51] versus attempt at making us feel single
[03:01:53] all good
[03:01:55] cook animal test 6308 absorption test
[03:01:58] enhanced Panama module 75 stand
[03:02:02] clearance
[03:02:06] I'm literally playing Electro and hydro
[03:02:10] and it got cryo
[03:02:13] I know this enemy dances cryo okay I'm
[03:02:15] not dumb but like dude [ __ ] off
[03:02:18] we need to apply dendro I should have
[03:02:20] done that earlier it's fine don't die on
[03:02:21] sucrose okay this is a normal attacks do
[03:02:24] some no attacks get some oh
[03:02:29] [ __ ] it
[03:02:30] I'm healing I'm noticing it
[03:02:34] don't be scared witness the power get
[03:02:37] sucrose to C6 they said it'll be fun
[03:02:39] they said
[03:02:40] rain lines
[03:02:43] by Royal
[03:02:45] come on our sucrose the hyperbloom is
[03:02:48] not even out though uh yeah her I mean
[03:02:51] her done drop time's not the most but
[03:02:52] it's fine
[03:03:01] oh Kitty who died
[03:03:07] the C6 special necessary for this team
[03:03:09] no
[03:03:11] see this visuals always just good but
[03:03:13] like
[03:03:13] it doesn't really change how you play it
[03:03:15] just makes it better
[03:03:17] all right 12-3
[03:03:19] I don't know why I'm talking like this
[03:03:20] is going to be a video because I don't
[03:03:21] think it is but
[03:03:25] they're dancing don't bother them
[03:03:29] well they didn't ask me if they could
[03:03:30] dance
[03:03:40] what am I doing
[03:03:46] hey thanks for the random I hope you're
[03:03:47] doing well
[03:03:49] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm normal I promise
[03:03:52] okay
[03:03:53] let me let me try this again let me try
[03:03:55] this again let me try this again let's
[03:03:56] do this again but a bit nicer and a bit
[03:03:58] spicier
[03:04:00] okay here's what we're gonna do Bennett
[03:04:02] first then Rosaria to give some crit
[03:04:04] rate right boom boom then Shank
[03:04:10] we're gonna start with shangling we're
[03:04:11] gonna start with shangling
[03:04:22] we're gonna start late
[03:04:25] huh everybody standing you can't run
[03:04:28] it's fine we still stopped all this
[03:04:31] freeze
[03:04:32] this is good this is good shangling
[03:04:34] just wanted to make sure I was embedded
[03:04:35] buff
[03:04:38] Rosario boom catch everything catch
[03:04:41] everything nice
[03:04:43] we missed the vanity but still nice let
[03:04:45] me just get some particles before I go
[03:04:46] to the corner and hide are you
[03:04:51] it's okay no it's okay I'm gonna Dodge
[03:04:53] this
[03:04:56] I'm just waiting for her to walk over so
[03:04:58] that these two can group up and be
[03:04:59] reunited
[03:05:02] now watch us
[03:05:07] shangling
[03:05:11] and now we are rivers nothing well in a
[03:05:14] second once the app changes there you go
[03:05:15] I don't have any skills ready
[03:05:18] to swap to her all good
[03:05:26] teamwork I love this team because you're
[03:05:28] always swapping you're nothing damaged
[03:05:31] also it's better than AOE but that's
[03:05:33] what it is
[03:05:35] wait
[03:05:37] dude she just
[03:05:39] she just jumped up
[03:05:45] oh she had her official in team doesn't
[03:05:47] Max yeah need more damage for hyperloom
[03:05:48] no yes for hyperloom no for the team
[03:05:51] first of all sucrose is the one that's
[03:05:52] hyper building most of the time and
[03:05:53] that's what you want you apply Electro
[03:05:54] official then you spread
[03:05:56] with Supergirls and she's the one I've
[03:05:57] been moving however even if fish will
[03:05:59] like she officially gets some hyperlooms
[03:06:01] but even official War hyperlooming it's
[03:06:03] better to focus on her damage because
[03:06:04] her damage is so high but yeah it's
[03:06:06] still a good subset but suka's the one
[03:06:07] that's mostly hybrid
[03:06:09] okay 12 30 seconds let's go
[03:06:11] fight brain outlines your face
[03:06:15] oh I should have altered
[03:06:19] should I burst It On official there but
[03:06:20] it is what it is
[03:06:22] I'm gonna iframe this instead of jumping
[03:06:23] nevermind sucrose has dog [ __ ] iframes
[03:06:33] what I'm actually learning this boss's
[03:06:34] mechanics how is he still talented calm
[03:06:37] down it's a [ __ ] it's a simple boss calm
[03:06:39] down it's not that impressive no one's
[03:06:41] impressed right now
[03:06:44] okay okay I forgot how many I'm sorry I
[03:06:46] forgot how many attacks he did I'm sorry
[03:06:49] thyself
[03:06:54] don't be scared
[03:06:57] we're gonna swap back this thing Joe to
[03:06:59] use his skill in a second
[03:07:06] notice that we like weren't hyperlooming
[03:07:08] at all with just odds and then we
[03:07:09] swapped the sucrose and she hyperloot
[03:07:11] the beauty of sucrose
[03:07:13] yeah actually
[03:07:15] um cos was good sucrose sucks
[03:07:17] who sucks
[03:07:19] I love Cosmo though but
[03:07:24] there you go that was pretty easy a lot
[03:07:26] of time to spare
[03:07:38] not gonna lie our first half was pretty
[03:07:41] bad rotation but the rest is pretty good
[03:07:42] so yeah I don't think it's gonna be made
[03:07:44] into a video but just in case in case
[03:07:45] anyone's wondering
[03:07:47] here are our builds for our characters
[03:07:49] let me actually make a party setup so I
[03:07:51] can go through them like that
[03:07:53] instead of having to rearrange it
[03:07:57] uh well we're our teams we had sucrose
[03:08:02] foreign
[03:08:07] [Music]
[03:08:15] sorry uh soon maybe I don't know I maybe
[03:08:18] who knows you never know until you know
[03:08:24] so let's look through the builds really
[03:08:26] fast in case you're wondering
[03:08:28] Rosaria
[03:08:29] oh four star weapons too by the way so I
[03:08:31] mean R5 Pepe W but like you know you get
[03:08:33] it uh dragon's vein for some yeah two
[03:08:35] blizzard search Universal oblige uh you
[03:08:38] know decent talents pretty decent crit
[03:08:39] ratio low ER could have a little bit
[03:08:41] more but it is what it is good ratio on
[03:08:43] arkaya as well he has zero em though but
[03:08:44] all good black lift long sword R1 I
[03:08:46] wanted to use wolfang Bros like I might
[03:08:48] as well not use a battle pass weapon but
[03:08:49] usually I use wolfang uh and then for
[03:08:51] emblem because emblem is emblem you
[03:08:53] could also use that on Rosario if you
[03:08:54] have some Er pretty good pretty good
[03:08:56] pretty good pretty good shangling Emblem
[03:08:57] The Catch tell me why yep boom pretty
[03:09:01] good uh I don't know why I started
[03:09:03] singing Bennett's on stop with blade
[03:09:05] because usually we use Aquila favonia
[03:09:06] which I'll switch to right now but for
[03:09:07] the four star weapon we have sapwood
[03:09:09] blade uh he's on foreign with literally
[03:09:12] just a bunch of ER
[03:09:14] then our other team was sucrose full em
[03:09:16] uh with stock frags now normally I have
[03:09:18] more em but uh my good em pieces are on
[03:09:21] kazua and I said you know what I don't
[03:09:23] really want to change that so yeah just
[03:09:24] em main stats a good feather and then a
[03:09:26] doctor flower
[03:09:31] credit artist that painted your stupid
[03:09:32] mate outfit thing
[03:09:35] I asked
[03:09:37] chat multiple I I asked them to DM me

[03:09:44] I want to I want to I Wanna I don't know
[03:09:47] who it is
[03:09:49] I guess I could ask in Discord too but I
[03:09:51] asked
[03:09:52] sucrose is not that good you're not that
[03:09:54] good
[03:09:57] thank you there's a problem anyways
[03:09:59] where were we
[03:10:03] official two golden two Vermillion

[03:10:11] posted in my Discord randomly
[03:10:15] but

[03:11:06] they post it we wear
[03:11:12] chill um um
[03:11:14] anyways what are we doing two golden
[03:11:16] Rebellion obviously you want four golden
[03:11:18] troop but I don't have it yet so
[03:11:19] whatever we don't talk about it
[03:11:20] stringless
[03:11:22] uh that's okay ratio but I mean for
[03:11:24] stringless it's good uh we're working on
[03:11:26] the four piece it would be better and
[03:11:28] then we have
[03:11:32] who else do we have sing Cho where's
[03:11:34] sing Cho
[03:11:36] some Joe he's pretty simple again not
[03:11:38] much on him to sack sword an emblem and

[03:14:50] oh
[03:15:04] don't even use her I do use Utah
[03:15:10] needs gold right no
[03:15:17] Crown the normal normal uh is like
[03:15:21] similar to eat it's usually slightly
[03:15:23] better like a little bit but the problem
[03:15:25] is I like flexing my burst damage too so
[03:15:28] I kind of want to if anything I kind of
[03:15:29] want to do the skill because I care
[03:15:31] about my burst damage like normal
[03:15:33] attacks better but like I don't know if
[03:15:35] I care
[03:15:36] because skill also increases burst
[03:15:38] damage
[03:15:41] just Triple Crown check

[03:17:06] good if I go the uh
[03:17:08] uh the crit one this one the only
[03:17:10] problem with this is now people will

[03:45:07] that's plus four that's Plus for it I
[03:45:09] have a lot of ones I'm actually
[03:45:10] exploring true
[03:45:12] stop typing prage death please please
[03:45:13] it's giving me bad vibes I don't like it
[03:45:31] stop it my voice didn't crack I'm sorry
[03:45:35] that was the mic
[03:45:37] stop typing defense stop it stop
[03:46:06] it was so beautiful it was such a good
[03:46:10] piece
[03:46:12] it was so nice
[03:46:38] dude it's actually good
[03:46:41] okay it's ah [ __ ] it's actually usable
[03:46:44] dude can you imagine if the
[03:46:47] can you imagine if there was anything
[03:46:49] else like attack percent or ER even uh
[03:46:51] yeah yeah but if it went like crit rate
[03:46:58] nice plus eight piece
[03:47:04] Lenny only needs like crit damage and
[03:47:06] like kind of attack percent
[03:47:11] I mean yeah
[03:47:14] not even 30 crit value
[03:47:29] okay it's better than this though I
[03:47:31] literally have this piece locked
[03:47:33] although this has HP and ER but
[03:47:38] oh wait I have the exact same piece I
[03:47:40] have the exact same piece but with 58 DM
[03:47:43] instead of 79 defense
[03:47:45] same amount of flat to talk to same flat
[03:47:47] attack same creative same crit rate and
[03:47:49] then defense versus em okay well I guess
[03:47:52] we won't use this done yeah
[03:47:54] the EM is just yeah
[03:47:57] hello Lenny has no defense so flat
[03:47:59] defense is optimal that is true make him
[03:48:02] less squishy same song I'm sorry
[03:48:06] I'll change list
[03:48:14] but yeah
[03:48:28] Zach just know I would have kept that
[03:48:30] piece really that would go ahead
[03:48:33] I mean it's not even that bad like 21
[03:48:35] crit damage on what is basically
[03:48:37] Blizzard's rare if you're playing mini
[03:48:38] like because you need the same amount of
[03:48:40] crit rate as blizzister is like
[03:48:42] not bad
[03:48:44] it's usable for sure but with my
[03:48:46] artifact centers
[03:48:54] copium holy
[03:48:56] it's not even copium
[03:49:03] any weekly missions we gotta do let's go
[03:49:05] cook and Forge true
[03:49:13] goes a witch too much I should say a
[03:49:15] good temporary build for hotel yes
[03:49:16] good good two pieces if you just start

[03:53:20] foreign
[03:54:42] foreign
[03:55:05] [ __ ] it I'll do a single pull to
[03:55:07] distract you guys wait what do we need
[03:55:08] we need near this HP sword right should
[03:55:09] I do a temple dude [ __ ] it no no no no
[03:55:22] but I don't want the weapons anymore
[03:55:25] who would I use the HP sword on I I
[03:55:27] don't think I'd give it to new lou
[03:55:28] because it's too ugly
[03:55:30] could I use it on Kirara Layla yeah
[03:55:33] could give it to nulu but I don't know

[03:55:51] worst case we build pity I guess copium
[03:55:54] don't build pity at home kids
[03:56:01] knew the sword
[03:56:14] I mean it did Shirley Shirley Navia HP
[03:56:19] Claymore who also needs the EM effect
[03:56:22] because uh not just crystallized but
[03:56:24] crystallize part two she's gonna save
[03:56:26] Geo and crystallize will now give you
[03:56:28] more damage when you're shielded based
[03:56:30] on your em think about that the element
[03:56:33] of the crystal that's infused kind of
[03:56:34] like swirl right like Petra the crystal
[03:56:37] you pick up gives you damage bonus to
[03:56:39] your active character of that element
[03:56:40] based on your em
[03:56:42] let him cook let him cook

[04:08:09] [Music]
[04:08:12] I'm gonna send out what's an emoji to
[04:08:13] send
[04:08:14] right away
[04:08:16] that's wholesome you too
[04:08:24] purple C6 Elon and dipped
[04:08:27] true
[04:08:30] is here that build yeah I might make it
[04:08:33] into either a clip or a command
[04:08:35] and then just have it like as a command
[04:08:37] and then I'll have the guide too like
[04:08:38] actually that will have like build and
[04:08:40] then guide Maybe
[04:08:52] isn't it 5am yes and
[04:08:56] No One's Gonna Be able to spell his name
[04:08:59] no that's [ __ ] up
[04:09:06] never let
[04:09:08] though because it looks more natural
[04:09:10] with this spelling but
[04:09:14] revealed myself
[04:09:17] does it work yes hydra's better but if
[04:09:20] you know okay you can use it for if you
[04:09:23] have better subsides and [ __ ]
[04:09:24] same with circuit although I would
[04:09:26] probably choose circlet over goblet as
[04:09:29] what you would replace if you have like
[04:09:30] a lot of crude damage for example but it
[04:09:32] could be subset dependent
[04:09:39] but my okay
[04:09:40] yeah
[04:09:42] I could probably get more HP though
[04:09:44] what a 58 A.M
[04:09:48] this has 37 and then probably yeah just
[04:09:50] a straight sub stat
[04:09:55] or eventually uh maybe I have a goblet
[04:09:56] that has HP I don't actually know like a
[04:09:58] hydro goblet with some HP Subs like
[04:10:00] Hydro damage could damage HP Maybe
[04:10:04] uh I only has crit rate that one has
[04:10:06] four
[04:10:08] yeah that's it
[04:10:13] criter damage circle with a signature
[04:10:15] both are fine but the remember that
[04:10:17] marriage gives you
[04:10:19] um 12 times three so 36 crit rate so
[04:10:23] you don't need as much you might still
[04:10:25] be able to use a crittery circuit like I
[04:10:27] have 52 right so upgraded circuit is
[04:10:29] less than 52.
[04:10:31] but yeah
[04:10:36] there'll be a muscle nobody's really
[04:10:37] good really really really good I think
[04:10:39] it's pretty broken as a DPS doesn't
[04:10:41] us pull though a Hydro 5 star's value
[04:10:43] depends on how many other Hydro 5 Stars
[04:10:45] you have and also
[04:10:46] uh uh if you need a DPS or not
[04:10:50] it's 300 Overkill kind of no like crude
[04:10:53] image is always good but
[04:10:55] when you're really high crit damage HP
[04:10:57] circular can be about as good or
[04:10:59] slightly better
[04:11:00] depends on sub stats so like there's an
[04:11:02] argument to go HP circuit here instead
[04:11:04] of damage but it's not a huge difference
[04:11:06] and also yeah
[04:11:12] crit also looks nicer true
[04:11:17] weapon
[04:11:18] at home
[04:11:19] this is what we're on with uh if we go
[04:11:21] Amber I mean our HP is low because it's
[04:11:23] level 70 but
[04:11:25] I guess
[04:11:31] definitely a big difference but still be
[04:11:34] good
[04:11:39] we're also 977 now
[04:11:41] C6 nowhere to zero we're 977 but I want
[04:11:44] to try to get I want to Crown this for
[04:11:46] sure
[04:11:48] wait what days is this oh tomorrow as
[04:11:50] well so yeah okay
[04:11:54] doesn't sack Catalyst give too much
[04:11:56] criterate what do you mean Sac catalyst
[04:11:59] this how does this give crit rate
[04:12:01] or do you mean like
[04:12:04] hey
[04:12:06] oh sag Jade I was like I've never heard
[04:12:11] someone call it sack my bad my bad okay
[04:12:14] my bad my bad yeah for Jade no it
[04:12:17] doesn't give too much good rate because
[04:12:18] it's like 36 which is basically like a
[04:12:20] circuit so at that point you wouldn't
[04:12:21] want to criterate Circle it like the
[04:12:23] reason why mine every day has so much
[04:12:24] criter is because 10 here five percent
[04:12:27] here
[04:12:28] 12 almost 13 here seven and then like
[04:12:32] every single artifact I have has crit
[04:12:34] rate so like if you go sag Jade let's
[04:12:35] say I have like solar Pearl on right
[04:12:37] which is not quite as much but yeah then
[04:12:40] I could literally just go like instead
[04:12:41] of this flower I'll go the one that has
[04:12:43] more crew damage I don't really have an
[04:12:44] amazing one but you know for example
[04:12:46] like this one although it kind of sucks
[04:12:49] um or like my like this sense is just a
[04:12:52] bunch of crit rate so
[04:12:58] foreign
[04:13:08] Atlas his best in slot you're saying
[04:13:10] you're asking if the the okay you're
[04:13:13] asking if the weapon that gives you
[04:13:15] attack percent with a high base attack
[04:13:16] is the best in slot on a character whose
[04:13:18] damage comes from HP
[04:13:22] sus
[04:13:28] the elemental damage isn't bad
[04:13:31] 12 there you go
[04:13:47] American account on the CN server am I
[04:13:49] uh free to play counts on the Asia
[04:13:51] server
[04:14:00] that we don't have an extra track in a
[04:14:02] Vlad command I mean SMH for a new vid
[04:14:04] brings up the guide but I should
[04:14:05] probably make a command I think we'll do
[04:14:06] that later
[04:14:08] is lost press good yeah it's fine it's
[04:14:10] pretty decent there's a weapon rank in
[04:14:11] my video if you are like
[04:14:13] more curious
[04:14:19] so I'm a good cop said if nothing else
[04:14:21] no
[04:14:22] two of these two bees is really not bad
[04:14:24] like I felt bad because I couldn't
[04:14:25] emphasized like 400 depth is viable but
[04:14:27] like it's literally 400 depth two piece
[04:14:29] two piece four wander four uh nymph for
[04:14:33] [ __ ] the other Set uh I forget what
[04:14:35] it is the bolide they're all like really
[04:14:37] similar and because they're all similar
[04:14:39] to two piece two-piece like it's within
[04:14:41] like two percent of each other like like
[04:14:43] one will be like
[04:14:45] it'll be like heart attack than two
[04:14:46] piece two beats than the others but
[04:14:47] they're all like about two percent
[04:14:48] difference which is like one sub Stat or
[04:14:51] two like it's very minimal so like
[04:14:53] generally just go sub stats so yeah
[04:14:55] Force you could be like oh but whatever
[04:14:57] sub stats on foreshine but that's like
[04:14:58] why because you get you you drain your
[04:15:01] own [ __ ] energy so like you might as
[04:15:03] well go to these HP two piece like hard
[04:15:05] like uh Hydro something nymphocus attack
[04:15:07] yeah but it also gives like 30 Hydro
[04:15:09] damage
[04:15:13] so yeah don't go I wouldn't go Sean
[04:15:23] these are the calcs I linked them in my
[04:15:25] video
[04:15:27] we can go through this so
[04:15:36] so here
[04:15:39] I mean I talked about the sets but I
[04:15:40] also linked these calcs because I it was
[04:15:44] like oh maybe I should have like I put
[04:15:46] her left on screen but I didn't like say
[04:15:48] anything I should have so I was like
[04:15:49] I'll just link these cows as well and
[04:15:51] add something and like look like it's
[04:15:53] literally like I mean I talked about
[04:15:54] this but
[04:15:55] magazines like always go back I should
[04:15:57] say there's like no reason not to unless
[04:15:58] you don't have it which you might not
[04:15:59] like I didn't have it for a while so
[04:16:01] that's fine but other than that it's
[04:16:02] like hard depth two piece doobies other
[04:16:05] four pieces they're all like not only
[04:16:07] are they worse but they're all
[04:16:08] interchangeable with one another like
[04:16:10] for her death is about as good as to be
[04:16:11] stupid like literally basically as good
[04:16:14] so like it's not like
[04:16:16] yeah so it just goes upside same with
[04:16:19] bow light if you're running a shield or
[04:16:20] same with like nymph wonders like
[04:16:22] they're pretty they're not as good like
[04:16:23] 89 versus 85 so it's you know but yeah
[04:16:28] this also assumes a rotation with three
[04:16:34] wait this is second rotation onwards
[04:16:36] I wonder if the first rotation also is
[04:16:38] only three charge hacks or four because
[04:16:40] I assume like the chargeback damage set
[04:16:42] would give you would be more valuable if
[04:16:44] you're doing three four charge tracks
[04:16:46] instead of three like but yeah anyways
[04:16:48] like it varies but it's pretty similar
[04:16:49] so keep that in mind
[04:16:58] foreign
[04:17:16] okay uh final at it
[04:17:22] I like it it's kind of hard to see when
[04:17:25] it's that small but I like it Let me
