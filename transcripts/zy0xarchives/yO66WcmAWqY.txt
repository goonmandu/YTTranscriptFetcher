[00:05:40] oh God
[00:05:46] okay I'm just gonna say it
[00:05:49] I'm just gonna say it here are my two
[00:05:51] takes going into this number one
[00:05:54] we can fix Cara he just needs a hug true
[00:05:57] number two actually part of the same
[00:05:59] take dotori is the only actually evil
[00:06:01] character if he ever gets redeemed I'm
[00:06:03] actually going to eat my microphone live
[00:06:05] on stream before before making a tweet
[00:06:07] about how I'm quitting against an impact
[00:06:08] and then not actually quitting wait is
[00:06:10] that where my glasses cleaner is it's
[00:06:11] under my monitor oh my God I found it
[00:06:14] sorry anyways that's number one take
[00:06:16] that's take number one tatori is the
[00:06:17] actual evil one except he's still hot
[00:06:19] but he's also evil number two not
[00:06:22] because he's evil but anyways number two
[00:06:24] Nikita is the only man foreign
[00:06:28] but he does like one of the only like
[00:06:31] actually useful archons in her Quest so
[00:06:33] surely I can trust her judgment other
[00:06:35] than the deal she made with the Torre
[00:06:37] why did you do that I don't get
[00:06:39] what could you expect why do you think
[00:06:42] sumero would keep me around otherwise
[00:06:44] or maybe killing me is all you can think
[00:06:46] about oh but if that's the case
[00:06:49] why haven't you done it already yeah
[00:06:52] kill him imagine we kill him right there
[00:07:00] chat stop saying okay listen how down
[00:07:03] bad you have to be the type
[00:07:04] guess I had you all wrong there I was
[00:07:07] thinking you were just getting cold feet
[00:07:09] how are down buddies be the type people
[00:07:11] hey High scar in my chat he's not gonna
[00:07:13] see it he doesn't know you
[00:07:17] just kidding he knows you but only if
[00:07:19] you subscribe with twitch Prime
[00:07:24] [Music]
[00:07:27] yeah
[00:07:29] yeah I think with Scara so I think
[00:07:30] scarra the reason why he's so like
[00:07:32] grumpy is because he has a low center of
[00:07:33] gravity because he's pretty short that's
[00:07:35] why character like tall characters like
[00:07:36] shower so chill and like Ito is like fun
[00:07:38] and playful whereas the the shorter ones
[00:07:40] are like the low center of gravity it
[00:07:42] can uh change your emotions I think
[00:07:45] it's not every day you see people
[00:07:47] questioning it's a problem wisdom's
[00:07:49] judgment
[00:07:56] yeah the terms are reasonable I don't
[00:07:59] think there's a problem in making a deal
[00:08:01] even with the balladeer okay well I for
[00:08:05] one have no reason to doubt you
[00:08:07] considering you even struck a deal with
[00:08:10] a doctor
[00:08:11] yes one in which I gained valuable
[00:08:14] information wait did she tell us oh is
[00:08:16] that like okay I'm not gonna spoil
[00:08:18] everything but was that like the the sky
[00:08:20] thing
[00:08:22] yeah yeah she was like yeah yeah yeah
[00:08:24] yeah
[00:08:26] yeah yeah yeah yeah okay cool
[00:08:29] [Music]
[00:08:34] but completely a strategic threat to us
[00:08:37] that puts him in quite a precarious
[00:08:39] position I should have named scarra baby
[00:08:41] girl no he's not baby girl he's
[00:08:43] literally the definition of a brat he
[00:08:46] hates you being stuck here or he likes
[00:08:48] you but he won't admit it Sitting Duck
[00:08:50] quack
[00:08:57] [Music]
[00:08:58] I take no pleasure in saying this but it
[00:09:02] seems as if the doctor had no intention
[00:09:04] of welcoming back a loser oh [ __ ]
[00:09:09] yo that's okay I don't know if that's
[00:09:12] toxic if that's based but dude
[00:09:15] no wait the Tony said hey he's a loser
[00:09:17] oh I just tossed him
[00:09:19] that's kind of [ __ ] up that's actually
[00:09:22] [ __ ] up that's actually [ __ ] up
[00:09:24] but also
[00:09:26] that's [ __ ] up
[00:09:28] sometimes
[00:09:30] other times it's them using you
[00:09:33] most human relationships are this way
[00:09:36] certainly all the stable ones are
[00:09:39] that's how it was between me and the
[00:09:41] fatoui
[00:09:42] and also between each of the harbingers
[00:09:45] um so as long as you have some value to
[00:09:47] offer nobody will ever abandon you
[00:09:50] but after recent events
[00:09:52] even I have to admit that I'm not worth
[00:09:55] quite what I used to be can you turn it
[00:09:58] up a bit uh I can turn up on my stream
[00:09:59] side right now I can turn up that game
[00:10:01] later but I just made my stream thing a
[00:10:03] bit louder exactly 2.9 decibels louder
[00:10:05] you will notice well if the fatou are
[00:10:07] going to reevaluate my utility I need to
[00:10:10] have a backup plan for myself
[00:10:14] I appreciate the sub though yeah I'll
[00:10:17] just be my others for this section
[00:10:19] so why not join forces with us
[00:10:22] I think these two have made their
[00:10:23] objection to that idea fairly clear
[00:10:25] don't you
[00:10:27] and they're your friends
[00:10:29] so I guess you'll be siding with them
[00:10:32] yeah obviously
[00:10:34] don't listen to him well actually we
[00:10:37] could strike a deal that's nahida I just
[00:10:39] voice acted reverse on watch who takes
[00:10:41] 18 months
[00:10:43] time today can be a trial run no way
[00:10:46] trial
[00:10:51] all right then I'll do what we agreed
[00:10:55] go now and keep in touch
[00:10:58] are you
[00:11:00] are you serious about it if she slaps
[00:11:02] pymon a hundred gifted Subs [ __ ]
[00:11:07] [ __ ] is that I'm largely doing yes
[00:11:11] as I told you once before there's Imran
[00:11:13] fishing
[00:11:15] hey uh Nikita what about the greater
[00:11:17] Lord Rooks Nevada huh what about her oh
[00:11:20] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] now you have to die too oh
[00:11:23] [ __ ] now Coley has [ __ ] whatever that
[00:11:25] thing was called again wow sorry I
[00:11:28] didn't say that
[00:11:29] I'm sorry oh yeah
[00:11:34] oh yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:11:36] I would never do that to Cole I would
[00:11:38] never do that clearly
[00:11:41] you need not included your twins details
[00:11:43] in the descender category
[00:11:45] this is an extremely important point
[00:11:48] it's possible that the fatoui have other
[00:11:51] information that even I don't know about
[00:11:54] and since the ballet deer used to be one
[00:11:56] of them he'll be better acquainted with
[00:11:58] this acquaint fate oh my God it all
[00:12:01] makes sense
[00:12:05] him
[00:12:11] mean in him
[00:12:17] Beyond description
[00:12:19] sifting through all of it without
[00:12:21] knowing what to look for would take too
[00:12:23] much even for me
[00:12:25] so I asked the balladeer to search an
[00:12:27] ermisole for any information about those
[00:12:29] ascenders
[00:12:31] he's more familiar with this kind of
[00:12:33] information and should be able to find
[00:12:35] it more quickly
[00:12:36] [Music]
[00:12:51] foreign
[00:13:14] what I thought I could do it fast I'm
[00:13:16] I'm sorry I'm sorry what do you want me
[00:13:18] to say
[00:13:20] um
[00:13:23] lunar
[00:13:25] I'm so I'm I'm I'm actually my brain
[00:13:28] should
[00:13:39] come on with all due respect if I could
[00:13:41] boil you into a stew as we speak I would
[00:13:50] what information he brings back
[00:13:52] and Traveler
[00:13:54] I know what your heart desires most of
[00:13:57] all
[00:13:58] our minds have connected several times
[00:14:00] before
[00:14:01] there's a corner intense Oh I thought
[00:14:04] that's it okay
[00:14:12] I'll hide them
[00:14:14] it is my responsibility to be on guard
[00:14:17] against the balladeer yeah but as
[00:14:20] someone who counts you as a friend oh
[00:14:22] we're a friend
[00:14:25] here can you give you the answers you've

[00:21:36] getting lost
[00:21:37] huh what do you know he was actually
[00:21:40] telling the truth
[00:21:41] [Music]
[00:21:45] what is it this time
[00:21:48] there's a time and a place
[00:21:51] I don't know what that's called but like
[00:21:53] the flops behind them they're pretty lit
[00:22:00] Veil that's what it's called we're here
[00:22:04] I liked hot capes though I think hot

[00:22:13] are you ready ready when you are then
[00:22:16] please begin
[00:22:17] preparing to access cognitive currents
[00:22:20] cognitive currents
[00:22:24] guess he must want to stay alive cause
[00:22:27] he found us oh he doesn't put up any
[00:22:29] resistance he seems to be good at
[00:22:31] working on the front line maybe he had a
[00:22:32] similar role in the fatoui first
[00:22:34] abacadabra and salt akaba stories
[00:22:38] if you discover anything at all make
[00:22:41] sure to share it with us
[00:22:42] will do
[00:22:45] it was a Kaaba it wasn't that hard it
[00:22:47] was not that hard
[00:22:49] how did I mess it up
[00:22:55] would you like to talk
[00:22:59] yes I've also invited pymon to join I
[00:23:03] mean why is pymon here now too oh my God
[00:23:06] nahida I thought we were friends I
[00:23:08] thought
[00:23:09] they don't want to disturb the balladeer
[00:23:18] on the private conversation she made a
[00:23:20] whole new server
[00:23:24] been wanting to ask you something don't
[00:23:27] you think the balladeer is a bit of a
[00:23:28] walking contradiction he
[00:23:31] but he seems to
[00:23:32] what you said
[00:23:35] are you gonna ban scar simps now let
[00:23:38] them have their moment however maybe the
[00:23:40] person called danesleaf pegger could
[00:23:43] um you know receive like a a little time
[00:23:45] out you know something like that maybe
[00:23:47] like maybe like calm down a little
[00:23:51] that's all
[00:23:58] oh he's such a mystery
[00:24:01] stand he said he's so mysterious
[00:24:15] actually I got a glimpse of a few things
[00:24:17] when I ran into hypasia at Paris Di
[00:24:20] you relate what you saw in the
[00:24:22] balladeer's mind
[00:24:28] well it's true
[00:24:31] betrayal turned the paladeir into the
[00:24:33] person he is today
[00:24:35] ah
[00:24:36] I thought nothing could get under that
[00:24:38] eye skin turns out he can get hurt and
[00:24:41] angry like anyone else yeah he just
[00:24:43] bottles up he literally just needs a
[00:24:45] therapist
[00:24:48] plan could have been the whole story
[00:24:51] Quest could have been avoided
[00:24:54] [Music]
[00:25:02] do you know anything about that if you
[00:25:05] mean the mysterious events
[00:25:08] oh this is the recap of the NPC show he
[00:25:10] skipped okay because from what they were
[00:25:14] saying it sounded like lots of tatara
[00:25:16] soon as history is still unexplained and
[00:25:20] most of the information we have now is
[00:25:22] just from people filling the gaps with
[00:25:24] their imagination
[00:25:28] all Animo boys need a therapy
[00:25:31] venti just needs alcohol he's fine
[00:25:40] well they guessed right well this shot
[00:25:42] on this is an unusual stream time for me
[00:25:44] so we have less mods
[00:25:46] must be a riveting conversation you
[00:25:48] three are having
[00:25:49] funny how all the good ones happen when
[00:25:51] I'm not involved
[00:25:54] [Music]
[00:25:58] don't insult me you're having a private
[00:26:00] conversation without me obviously I must
[00:26:03] be the topic of said conversation
[00:26:09] of course you do you can't have your
[00:26:11] prisoner knowing too much
[00:26:13] so uh have you found anything yet
[00:26:19] still looking don't get your hopes up
[00:26:21] though
[00:26:22] you and your twin from outside this
[00:26:24] world it wouldn't surprise me if there
[00:26:26] was nothing on either of you in Urban
[00:26:28] Soul at all
[00:26:33] it's not like we've never met before and
[00:26:36] anyway you're world famous
[00:26:39] it'd be more right now we have to keep
[00:26:41] the peace I'm not interested in creating
[00:26:43] more misery for myself
[00:26:45] conversation is something I can manage
[00:26:48] I'd mod Little Peach because they're
[00:26:50] regular but they made the Luke and they
[00:26:51] asked for the dilute guide so I can't
[00:26:52] have that promoted
[00:26:58] that's not happening that's not
[00:27:00] happening
[00:27:05] that's not happening
[00:27:10] I'll be a good mod no you won't Ray you
[00:27:13] literally won't
[00:27:17] [Music]
[00:27:25] ask you a thing huh
[00:27:28] wait
[00:27:33] okay
[00:27:34] wait it looks similar to those saplings
[00:27:38] what could it be anonymous dick hey do
[00:27:41] you forget the agreement you have to
[00:27:43] share it with that I'll open Twitch mod
[00:27:45] apps and Discord exclamation mark
[00:27:46] Discord so I didn't skip time on time
[00:27:48] just wait wait time he said shots
[00:27:59] it may not pay to act rashly
[00:28:02] there's no one else who can enter the
[00:28:04] furnace it has to be me
[00:28:07] is that so
[00:28:09] well since you insist
[00:28:13] ah what the [ __ ]
[00:28:16] this is a close-up
[00:28:20] knew what was the man in charge
[00:28:30] I have been in tatara sooner for some
[00:28:32] time now
[00:28:34] you have shown me great Hospitality as
[00:28:36] has mikoshi nagamasa and indeed everyone
[00:28:39] else
[00:28:40] under your leadership Totara Suna is a
[00:28:44] warm welcoming place like a giant
[00:28:47] village who the [ __ ] are you gainfully
[00:28:50] employed their lives have purpose
[00:29:03] it was originally established as a means
[00:29:05] of safely disposing Crystal marrow
[00:29:08] the foreign
[00:29:13] giving rise to generations of
[00:29:15] swordsmiths some World skills blood
[00:29:19] dreams every Smith brought into this
[00:29:22] trade looks to find their purpose
[00:29:24] between steel and blade
[00:29:26] that is why you accepted the proposal
[00:29:29] brought to you by myself and akame
[00:29:32] yes well were it not for you coming to
[00:29:35] Inazuma and happening to make akame's
[00:29:37] acquaintance
[00:29:38] the two of you never would have joined
[00:29:40] forces
[00:29:42] and he would be the first to admit that
[00:29:44] there's no way he could have
[00:29:45] revolutionized our forging process like
[00:29:47] this on his own
[00:29:48] at least not on the same time scale
[00:29:50] you allowed akame to take all the credit
[00:29:53] for a method that you jointly developed
[00:29:56] he sold it to me
[00:29:57] okay every piece of ore here is smelted
[00:30:01] using the new technique even now you
[00:30:04] remain one of tatara soon as key
[00:30:06] Consultants working right here alongside
[00:30:09] us
[00:30:10] I believe it is you sir who are truly
[00:30:14] responsible for the changes in our
[00:30:15] manufacturing and forging methods let me
[00:30:17] just call them out you flatter me
[00:30:19] from the outset I saw much that was
[00:30:21] commendable in the forging industry of
[00:30:23] Inazuma and it has been my great honor
[00:30:27] to befriend you all
[00:30:28] so you say Asher
[00:30:31] but is this really the truth my good sir
[00:30:34] oh what do you mean
[00:30:37] I tried to resist thinking it was all
[00:30:39] connected
[00:30:40] because I didn't want to speculate
[00:30:43] and I didn't want to believe that things
[00:30:45] could turn out this way what have we
[00:30:47] gained from adopting your new technology
[00:30:50] ominous black smoke
[00:30:52] mounting production problems oh
[00:30:55] worker fatigue and casualties are up and
[00:30:57] continuing to rise at an alarming rate
[00:31:00] and recently
[00:31:02] as you well know
[00:31:04] someone died because of that strange
[00:31:05] filth inside the fight
[00:31:08] still
[00:31:12] expect you understand it better than I
[00:31:14] do none of the people who went out to
[00:31:16] get help have come back
[00:31:18] now our mutual friend the Kabuki mono
[00:31:22] is taking the Golden Feather to narukami
[00:31:24] Island to seek an audience with Shogun
[00:31:27] this is our last hope this is their last
[00:31:29] hope doesn't oh shut up nothing does
[00:31:34] otherwise why would you still be
[00:31:36] standing there with that smile on your
[00:31:38] face
[00:31:41] I'm just surprised that you finally
[00:31:42] chose to be so sincere
[00:31:44] I'm sure you've been harboring these
[00:31:46] suspicions for quite some time thus
[00:31:52] mikoshi nagamasa may have noticed that
[00:31:54] there was one common denominator among
[00:31:55] all these events
[00:31:57] namely You Usher
[00:32:00] but Mr mikoshi is more cautious than I
[00:32:03] he does things by the book
[00:32:05] after all nagamasa is the adopted son of
[00:32:08] mikoshi torichio the Yokai struck down
[00:32:11] by the shogun's own hand
[00:32:13] if he truly seeks to redeem his family's
[00:32:16] honor an abundance of caution is well
[00:32:19] advised
[00:32:22] you're well informed on the subtleties
[00:32:24] of his situation
[00:32:26] you're right are you sure you're not a
[00:32:29] little overqualified
[00:32:36] sadly I am so very attached to my craft
[00:32:40] enough Escher
[00:32:42] I'm here because an evil force is Raging
[00:32:45] inside the furnace and someone knows
[00:32:47] take your new device inside the high
[00:32:49] risk zone so we can absorb it and put an
[00:32:51] end to the problem
[00:32:52] I'm in charge here
[00:32:54] and I'm about to take some
[00:32:55] responsibility and head inside
[00:32:57] probably to my death
[00:33:00] but what about you dude one of them's
[00:33:01] about to lament I just don't know which
[00:33:03] one's still doing here
[00:33:04] judging from the look in yours what is
[00:33:06] this angle you don't seem to trust me
[00:33:09] they're either gonna fight or kiss I
[00:33:11] we're past that now never mind
[00:33:13] whoever you are
[00:33:15] it looks like your plan to destroy
[00:33:16] tatara soon it has worked
[00:33:19] I just want to know what you're still
[00:33:21] doing here
[00:33:23] it's left
[00:33:24] wait she has a knife wait honestly I'm
[00:33:28] just waiting for the right moment
[00:33:31] all right that guy's dead yeah Rapunzel
[00:33:34] what the [ __ ] like this
[00:33:37] where you finish talking and I stop you
[00:33:39] from entering the furnace
[00:33:42] you
[00:33:44] you
[00:33:51] you're a little smarter than I initially
[00:33:53] gave you credit for
[00:33:55] I thought I'd disguise myself
[00:33:56] exceptionally well at least for the
[00:33:59] first few days
[00:34:01] dude what the [ __ ] you had your people
[00:34:03] look into my background right from the
[00:34:05] start
[00:34:06] it's a long journey from Inazuma to
[00:34:09] Fontaine but that didn't stop them
[00:34:12] eventually they managed to confirm that
[00:34:14] Asher was an alias and that I was not
[00:34:17] from Fontaine at all wait he's not
[00:34:20] lugoff's Dad despite all of that you
[00:34:23] still fail to realize my true weight
[00:34:30] did you really think you would be able
[00:34:32] to see through my plan oh no
[00:34:36] oh no it was actually an imposter among
[00:34:40] us all along so you're really going to
[00:34:42] destroy this place
[00:34:44] is that it oh but you're quite wrong
[00:34:48] there is one other person
[00:34:51] wait was this the Tori's voice actor the
[00:34:53] whole time see him as a person or the
[00:34:55] you told him yourself I swear his voice
[00:34:58] changed puppet you're a human you're
[00:35:02] just missing probably not
[00:35:07] whoever you're working for won't get
[00:35:09] away with this
[00:35:10] they'll be found out
[00:35:13] but
[00:35:15] makes no sense
[00:35:18] what are you really trying to accomplish
[00:35:19] by all this
[00:35:21] why go to all this trouble
[00:35:24] it's no trouble at all patience is a
[00:35:28] virtue which I have in abundance
[00:35:31] this is all part of a carefully
[00:35:33] controlled experiment
[00:35:36] if you must know I'm happy to divulge my
[00:35:38] true identity
[00:35:40] I'm a fatoui Harbinger call me
[00:35:44] the doctor
[00:35:46] um
[00:35:48] because I should have a theme song
[00:35:49] playing every time he talks what
[00:35:52] wants to create a minor inconvenience
[00:35:55] for you wait
[00:35:58] I can't tell that's [ __ ] up if that's
[00:36:00] Giga chat why is this only purpose to
[00:36:03] create a minor inconvenience
[00:36:06] that's it that's why you he just wants
[00:36:08] to create some problems with technology
[00:36:11] just to let loose the evil energy from
[00:36:14] the crystal marrow
[00:36:16] what the [ __ ]
[00:36:19] look how even the righteous soul is
[00:36:22] filled with Venom when faced with its
[00:36:24] demise
[00:36:26] my device functions precisely as you say
[00:36:29] it is the only chance you have of
[00:36:31] preventing a catastrophe and keeping the
[00:36:34] truth from the outside world however I
[00:36:38] did not make it with you in mind
[00:36:42] it is easier for a person to be
[00:36:44] possessed by evil spirits when they are
[00:36:46] filled with hate
[00:36:48] so give in to your Fury I want to see
[00:36:52] what happens when a malevolent heart is
[00:36:54] placed into an unsuspecting puppet
[00:36:57] make no mistake even without you that
[00:37:01] pure innocent puppet would only end up
[00:37:04] being used by someone else instead what
[00:37:08] other reason would a human have for
[00:37:10] befriending one who is not of Our Kind
[00:37:16] [Music]
[00:37:19] hahaha
[00:37:21] if you give him
[00:37:24] my heart
[00:37:26] tell him
[00:37:29] like a mother
[00:37:30] and I
[00:37:32] see him as
[00:37:34] one of us
[00:37:36] he has nothing to prove to anyone
[00:37:42] because not everyone
[00:37:45] just wants to use other people
[00:37:48] thumb
[00:37:49] the only ones
[00:37:55] people like you
[00:38:00] what a beautiful way to see the world it
[00:38:04] almost makes me feel a little guilty
[00:38:07] hmm then out of respect for you I shall
[00:38:11] redefine myself
[00:38:13] think of me as a monster or a demon if
[00:38:17] you wish
[00:38:18] at least this way your death is not a
[00:38:20] consequence of your own Folly turning
[00:38:22] you into an easy target
[00:38:24] you simply lost to something more
[00:38:26] powerful than you could ever
[00:38:30] I say Mr niwa let's see what happens
[00:38:33] will your puppet friend become a human
[00:38:37] no that will prove quite impossible
[00:38:40] Mr niwa
[00:38:43] already dead
[00:38:45] dumb pity
[00:38:47] [Music]
[00:38:52] Jester I have completed the task you
[00:38:54] gave me creating a gap and infiltrating
[00:38:57] inazuma's inner workings
[00:39:00] what fun it was
[00:39:07] I'd like to introduce a puppet to you if
[00:39:10] he proves useful let's make him our
[00:39:13] newest comrade and if not
[00:39:17] let's turn him to dust
[00:39:20] wow so that's a Scara
[00:39:23] origin story
[00:39:27] dumb
[00:39:32] are you all right you killed homeboy
[00:39:36] [Laughter]
[00:39:41] oh no
[00:39:45] although he's lamenting good
[00:39:56] Fontaine oh
[00:39:58] why did we see things from his
[00:40:00] perspective when I touched the doctor to
[00:40:03] confirm whether he'd eliminated all his
[00:40:05] segments I read this memory in his mind
[00:40:09] you have to admit it must be the truth
[00:40:12] maybe so
[00:40:14] but it means nothing
[00:40:16] does it
[00:40:18] but this memory shows that niwa didn't
[00:40:20] betray you
[00:40:21] he never meant for you the noise take
[00:40:24] the device into the furnace
[00:40:27] friend dies and he gets mad at his
[00:40:29] friend for dying
[00:40:31] but at least now he's not a doctor
[00:40:34] at least now he's not a doctor
[00:40:38] you know very well what that means
[00:40:41] even more so than I
[00:40:46] imagine dying that's literally what he
[00:40:49] said
[00:40:52] his imagination but where does that
[00:40:54] leave it where does this leave him
[00:41:01] um
[00:41:04] oh he's actually gonna lament I'm
[00:41:06] telling you scar is about to lament a
[00:41:09] witness he's about a lament
[00:41:11] the doctor was behind it but why has
[00:41:15] that gotten him so worked up
[00:41:17] nobody has ever deceived you like that
[00:41:19] pymon
[00:41:21] it's natural that you find it difficult
[00:41:23] yeah cause Paula doesn't have a [ __ ]
[00:41:24] brain so now you have the complete
[00:41:27] picture
[00:41:28] katsuragi took the Kabuki mono to live
[00:41:31] with the people of tatara Sunnah
[00:41:33] later the doctor showed up disguised as
[00:41:36] a mechanic from Fontaine
[00:41:38] and that's when the trouble began
[00:41:41] um all horrific experiments planned by
[00:41:43] the doctor
[00:41:45] everything he did was just a plant
[00:41:47] season wait this entire nahida I like
[00:41:49] that would bear fruit in the future this
[00:41:52] entire nahita explanation I feel like we
[00:41:54] deducted from the cutscene and then they
[00:41:55] just explained it to us in case our eyes
[00:41:57] were closed I'm not complaining like I
[00:41:59] but literally it was like we just saw
[00:42:01] what happened and then they're like this
[00:42:03] whole thing was what you just saw it's
[00:42:05] like okay
[00:42:06] difficult
[00:42:08] doctor killed his friend
[00:42:14] saw in that memory the doctor put newest
[00:42:17] heart into the device and handed it to
[00:42:20] the palateer
[00:42:21] then he instructed him to enter the
[00:42:24] furnace and absorb all the filth caused
[00:42:27] by the smelting process
[00:42:29] have you seen kitchen plays they don't
[00:42:30] read yet I'm I'm that person too but
[00:42:34] he left the furnace and sheer exhaustion
[00:42:37] and said to the mechanic
[00:42:39] this device seems to have protected me
[00:42:42] what's in it
[00:42:43] the mechanic answered
[00:42:45] you have fled this place for fear of
[00:42:47] punishment
[00:42:49] he left you a gift
[00:42:51] said it's the one thing that you've been
[00:42:53] looking for
[00:42:54] he took it straight from the chest of
[00:42:56] one of his innocent servants the
[00:42:59] mechanic removed to the withered heart
[00:43:01] from the device as he spoke the ballot
[00:43:04] here was stunned that such Unthinkable
[00:43:05] cruelty had brought in the thing he'd
[00:43:08] been longing for his entire life
[00:43:10] a heart acquired through cold-blooded
[00:43:13] murder is a cursed thing well it's kind
[00:43:15] of [ __ ] up
[00:43:22] very betrayal has ensured his survival
[00:43:26] overwhelmed with anger and sorrow the
[00:43:29] balladeer threw the heart to the ground
[00:43:31] and left a tarasuna without looking back
[00:43:34] holy
[00:43:37] holy mother at least eat the heart
[00:43:40] it's like what like 80 grams of protein
[00:43:44] more
[00:43:48] wait let me pause being betrayed
[00:43:50] abandoned by a close friend is sure to
[00:43:51] cause great resentment
[00:43:53] now we know okay I was kidding okay look
[00:43:57] I had the light in the mood somehow now
[00:43:59] we need to know what was behind his
[00:44:01] decision to take revenge on the ride in
[00:44:03] gokaden a hundred years ago wow true
[00:44:08] but that doesn't mean that Vengeance was
[00:44:11] the right decision
[00:44:13] [Music]
[00:44:19] there's not voice acted I mean it
[00:44:21] doesn't make sense just [ __ ] voice
[00:44:22] actor who the [ __ ] cares if the main
[00:44:24] character talks [ __ ] you [ __ ] the
[00:44:26] immersion I don't care if the [ __ ]
[00:44:28] six-year-olds think they're lumine [ __ ]
[00:44:29] you [ __ ] them too I hope their childhood
[00:44:31] is ruined voice actor MC thank you
[00:44:35] I'm kidding I mean
[00:44:39] oh no one didn't run from Justice you
[00:44:43] killed him thumb
[00:44:48] wait okay the only thing I was like kind
[00:44:50] of skipping too hard to understand like
[00:44:52] not scary but mental AFK and he was
[00:44:57] um like the same Clan or some [ __ ] are
[00:44:59] related to kazua yes yes and he is right
[00:45:03] Maybe
[00:45:04] ancestor Grandpa
[00:45:07] yeah okay
[00:45:11] wait so Shirley's car and cause are just
[00:45:13] Bros
[00:45:15] are you worried about me
[00:45:17] if we didn't have such a history I'd
[00:45:19] almost think that qualifies it was
[00:45:21] related to be your friend
[00:45:24] are you worried about me
[00:45:27] we just want to make sure this doesn't
[00:45:29] affect the plans
[00:45:30] I'll keep my end of the deal
[00:45:32] bam we're friends now
[00:45:36] [Music]
[00:45:39] that's why we're here
[00:45:44] but unfortunately there's no information
[00:45:46] about the descenders in Urban Soul even
[00:45:48] if you can't find anything that seems to
[00:45:50] confirm it
[00:45:52] permanent Soul doesn't not keep records
[00:45:54] on the descenders anyone who comes from
[00:45:56] Beyond this world is not counted as part
[00:45:58] of Tibet
[00:46:01] does that mean we have to have to leave
[00:46:02] empty empty-handed
[00:46:07] oh what if instead of leaving
[00:46:08] empty-handed we do a certified detori
[00:46:11] classic and we take pyrimon's heart and
[00:46:13] then we leave me and scarda together
[00:46:15] with pymon's heart true
[00:46:17] [Music]

[00:46:23] really upset

[00:46:30] might interest you

[00:46:35] why there are records about your brother
[00:46:36] and Herman's soul

[00:59:41] you didn't know I know about the sword
[00:59:43] like I know what the sword is it gives
[00:59:45] add an energy when you use uh so you
[00:59:47] Elemental skill it's really good for
[00:59:50] ayaka it's also good on other characters
[00:59:51] like gene or other sword users can use
[00:59:53] it too but yeah no no there's a question
[00:59:58] I wasn't expecting
[01:00:00] ah very well the once renowned ride in
[01:00:04] gokadon comprised of five branches
[01:00:08] aminoma futsu ishin yakume and old I see
[01:00:14] the arch of forging practiced by these
[01:00:17] five Clans was first taught to them
[01:00:19] personally by the almighty Shogun
[01:00:23] over time this guy talks so slow just
[01:00:26] diverged from one another as generations
[01:00:28] of bladesmiths honed and perfected their
[01:00:31] craft until they became five distinct
[01:00:33] Traditions most of the great swordsmith
[01:00:36] clans of old
[01:00:37] have since fallen into decline
[01:00:40] and for a long time only the armenoma
[01:00:43] brand but fortunately
[01:00:46] took out the mantle of the Asian art now
[01:00:48] two fans remain in the original go
[01:00:50] caught in five and my Eraser is right
[01:00:52] you were president when he forged the
[01:00:53] Asian blade
[01:00:59] my friends
[01:01:00] why was there the decline oh God in fact
[01:01:05] this was not made known to me for most
[01:01:07] of my life
[01:01:09] all these years
[01:01:11] I knew of those great Clan's demise but
[01:01:14] never the cause
[01:01:15] I'll be honest I skipped the whole
[01:01:17] Inazuma part wait should I okay low key
[01:01:19] shot I kind of gotta go to bed or got
[01:01:22] all these goals because I have to get I
[01:01:24] don't have to wake up early tomorrow and
[01:01:25] [ __ ] ah
[01:01:29] wait how long is left
[01:01:32] as we are both heirs to a branch of the
[01:01:34] right in gokaden
[01:01:36] it was right that I should know the
[01:01:38] truth half I'm in telling you
[01:01:43] it is a dark and sorrowful Tale
[01:01:47] the ride in Goku oh my God
[01:01:52] by a vengeful bladesmith
[01:01:56] 400 years ago
[01:01:58] so I'm told
[01:01:59] there was a catastrophic malfunction in
[01:02:02] tatara suna's furnace
[01:02:04] one Brave swordsmith heard the commotion
[01:02:07] and chose not normally I would be live
[01:02:09] longer but it rushed to the scene
[01:02:12] hoping to prevent a disaster
[01:02:15] Atara suno was home to a
[01:02:16] state-of-the-art forging and smelting
[01:02:18] operation okay we'll see we'll see and
[01:02:20] overseeing it was the Armory officer
[01:02:24] his surname was niwa though he had
[01:02:27] family ties to the kaida Hora Clan
[01:02:29] knowing that they had just one chance to
[01:02:31] save countless lives
[01:02:33] Mr niwa and the swordsmith leaped
[01:02:36] together into the furnace
[01:02:38] the furnace quickly stabilized but
[01:02:42] neither of them made it out
[01:02:44] The Smith's death no heroic
[01:02:47] dealt a devastating blow to his family's
[01:02:50] fortunes
[01:02:51] his orphaned son was left to fend for
[01:02:54] himself
[01:02:55] and grew up deeply resentful at the
[01:02:57] world okay it's hard
[01:03:00] the whole of Inazuma was culpable in his
[01:03:03] tragedy
[01:03:04] he hated the almighty Shogun for her
[01:03:07] apparent indifference towards his dude
[01:03:08] why does every game have a random old
[01:03:10] person NPC that knows everything
[01:03:12] ah yes I remember 67 years ago the only
[01:03:16] Legacy he had to pass on to his children
[01:03:18] was his hatred
[01:03:21] generation after generation bore this
[01:03:23] Grudge
[01:03:24] living in utter misery
[01:03:26] alas
[01:03:29] if only the story could have ended there
[01:03:32] but 100 years ago
[01:03:34] the then head of this family reached the
[01:03:37] end of his wits what happens all the
[01:03:39] time IRL I guess so no longer and yet he
[01:03:42] could do nothing to change it
[01:03:44] finally
[01:03:46] he made a drastic decision
[01:03:49] to take revenge on the ride in gokadon
[01:03:51] in doing so he sought to vent his pet
[01:03:54] tampenger and shake the very foundations
[01:03:57] of inazuma's forging industry
[01:03:59] in his Fury he murdered indiscriminately
[01:04:02] indiscriminately killing even
[01:04:04] bladesmiths which he belonged to but
[01:04:08] when he came to the kaidahara and
[01:04:10] kamisato Clans
[01:04:12] his Killing Spree came to an abrupt end
[01:04:15] he failed to catch them unawares
[01:04:18] they fought back here tied a horror Clan
[01:04:21] and their ishin art survived that day I
[01:04:24] guess they were lucky ones okay cool
[01:04:26] all right let's think about you just
[01:04:28] like every soul but it seems no I still
