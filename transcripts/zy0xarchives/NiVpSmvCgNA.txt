[00:47:51] anyways shut up like on well let's go
[00:47:54] for a blaze icon this is the first
[00:47:55] iPhone I pull for just because I like
[00:47:57] blade I like blade
[00:47:59] if you're gonna judge me for my spending
[00:48:02] look at him if you're gonna judge me
[00:48:03] judge yourself first look in the mirror
[00:48:06] and ask yourself where your priorities
[00:48:08] lie
[00:48:10] if I get another hemoko like cone I'm
[00:48:12] Banning everyone I chat I can see in
[00:48:14] chat for 10 minutes straight if you
[00:48:15] think this is a joke test me
[00:48:20] we're just going for E1 e0 S1 literally
[00:48:24] everyone in this game is easier as one
[00:48:25] what else playing g-u-n with my [ __ ]
[00:48:27] the [ __ ] what's her name himoko like
[00:48:30] going because I didn't pull for his like
[00:48:31] own everyone was like oh oh he's so bad
[00:48:33] oh he's so bad so we're gonna E1 S1 to
[00:48:38] be fair to the character to be fair to
[00:48:41] the character
[00:48:43] oh
[00:48:45] wait I forgot we needed swordplay that's
[00:48:47] good swordplay is really good because we
[00:48:48] can use this on we use this on yanching
[00:48:50] and refinements are good
[00:48:54] also I'm gonna say it I think
[00:48:55] superimposing sounds dumb refinement
[00:48:57] sounds so much better
[00:49:01] oh I superimposed my light cone
[00:49:05] super in position
[00:49:09] bad take dude it's so weird
[00:49:13] super hey man what's super imposition is
[00:49:16] your light cone
[00:49:18] I don't know
[00:49:26] uh I don't care about that minus minus
[00:49:29] sixteen hundred okay minus another 1600.
[00:49:31] this is gonna be a five star I can feel
[00:49:33] it
[00:49:34] it's not a five star
[00:49:44] okay
[00:49:52] that's good for blade
[00:49:55] okay I've gotten like four of these now
[00:49:57] I might not even want to pull for his
[00:49:59] lycone because if this is like good if
[00:50:01] you have this S5 it's like not that far
[00:50:03] behind it's pretty good
[00:50:07] but I guess okay we're too deep now
[00:50:08] we're actually in too deep but I kind of
[00:50:10] want to use that
[00:50:18] dude it's good it's like
[00:50:21] on average I guess 60 damage is like 40
[00:50:24] and then sometimes 40.
[00:50:26] more
[00:50:29] if you lose use Arlen and save so I like
[00:50:33] that take but the problem is If I Lose
[00:50:35] I'm gonna be so tilted that I'm gonna
[00:50:36] keep pulling so that logic doesn't work
[00:50:39] that logic does not work
[00:50:46] Orchestra name it's called Amino
[00:50:55] [ __ ] I should save
[00:50:57] I'll save I'll save I'll save
[00:51:00] sorry sorry I have too much energy I
[00:51:02] have to calm down oh five star
[00:51:04] please
[00:51:10] just I want to see Blade's face on a
[00:51:13] light cone and I'll be happy and I'll be
[00:51:15] a nice modest man of humble livings okay
[00:51:19] I don't need E6 I don't need refinements
[00:51:22] superimpositions I'll be e0 S1 and I'm
[00:51:24] happy I'm happy
[00:51:27] happy I can live in a humble house
[00:51:30] on the farm
[00:51:32] have some chickens to raise and I'm a
[00:51:34] happy man
[00:51:41] please dude stop
[00:51:48] I already have this
[00:52:04] foreign
[00:52:06] if I do it please dude I don't want to
[00:52:09] see this dude it's so bad
[00:52:12] I don't want it
[00:52:18] okay I won't do it
[00:52:19] I almost did it though
[00:52:22] [ __ ] it's not bad it's just like I don't
[00:52:25] I already have one I already have one

[00:52:44] yeah I lost the 75-25 and I got a light
[00:52:47] cone that I already have
[00:52:57] doesn't scale on HP
[00:53:01] oh my God
[00:53:03] um
[00:53:06] see it was the star rail gots hearing
[00:53:08] you say superimpose was a dumb name I
[00:53:10] can't
[00:53:15] um
[00:53:21] I mean I could use it on
[00:53:22] deserved what the hell is that was that
[00:53:25] deserved

[00:53:59] it literally doesn't such a waste

[01:09:05] lycon XP literally when in my life
[01:09:06] however been like yeah I pre-farmed for
[01:09:09] a weapon literally never so I did I
[01:09:12] actually performed for the weapon uh and
[01:09:14] I leveled uh silver wolf cyclone
[01:09:18] Upstream true real story by the way real
[01:09:21] story by the way look dude only for

[01:10:09] like that many but I literally went
[01:10:11] around and killed boss and like [ __ ]
[01:10:13] enemies
[01:10:15] laughs
[01:10:18] I did an enemy route
[01:10:22] that's like proof that I'm free to play
[01:10:24] right surely whales don't do that whales
[01:10:27] don't do that I'm like free to play
[01:10:29] adjacent I'm a free to play Ally
[01:10:31] okay cool level 80.
[01:10:37] um
[01:10:41] thank you
[01:10:43] [ __ ]
[01:10:46] look at this
[01:10:48] we can also plus 15 it but actually
[01:10:50] let's find safety net
[01:10:52] I was gonna do this off stream but I
[01:10:54] said I might as well level it on stream
[01:10:55] it'll be better content
[01:10:58] number one blade made you're about to
[01:10:59] [ __ ] see you're about to see you're
[01:11:01] literally about to see
[01:11:05] are you [ __ ] okay it's fine it's my deep
[01:11:08] breath stupid it's fine his new set is
[01:11:10] better anyways his new set is better it
[01:11:11] doesn't matter his new set is better his
[01:11:13] new says better it doesn't matter his
[01:11:14] news is better but you can do two piece
[01:11:16] that's why you can do two piece that's
[01:11:18] why like you could do two piece but
[01:11:20] we'll get the new set anyways so it is
[01:11:22] what it is it's fine like this is that
[01:11:25] we have a pretty good two piece for now
[01:11:26] like we have a good two B's and we'll
[01:11:28] get a two piece of the other side and
[01:11:29] then eventually we'll get a four piece
[01:11:30] also uh in Earth salsotto is low-key
[01:11:33] better than the new set
[01:11:35] uh I've seen some math on it like maybe
[01:11:38] maybe it'll change because the numbers
[01:11:39] are kind of iffy but it's like they're
[01:11:42] about as good inner being like slightly
[01:11:44] better
[01:11:46] um so this ball that we have
[01:11:48] no not a bad ball we also have this one
[01:11:51] but this set sucks
[01:11:53] huh how what do you mean how eight
[01:11:56] percent crit rate and then ultimate
[01:11:57] damage which he does and fall of attack
[01:11:59] damage which he does
[01:12:01] so they're like about as good
[01:12:03] but we'll see
[01:12:05] um the only problem is I don't have an
[01:12:08] HP rope
[01:12:09] well I do but these are the sub stats
[01:12:13] so we're gonna have to get a better HP
[01:12:14] one because I looked at my innard South
[01:12:16] soda right I filtered by HP and uh let's
[01:12:20] just say I didn't save any I don't know
[01:12:22] why I guess I didn't know
[01:12:29] new set is when you reach a 70 crit rate
[01:12:31] doesn't matter I'm assuming you're like
[01:12:33] 90 it doesn't matter like I'm assuming

[01:15:10] then I can't
[01:15:11] hello Mr socks

[01:15:21] do I believe you everglow takes it two
[01:15:23] months
[01:15:25] when's the blade guy coming out
[01:15:27] so it's it's recorded but it's not fully
[01:15:30] edited and I have to double check the
[01:15:32] math on some things because like all of
[01:15:34] it's like pre-release stuff right so
[01:15:36] like
[01:15:37] I need to make sure that like the math
[01:15:39] is actually like accurate
[01:15:47] but if you have blue Ultra with him
[01:15:48] they're insane together dude actually
[01:15:50] let me showcase something look so let's
[01:15:52] say you're in combat let me just find a
[01:15:53] random enemy
[01:15:57] um
[01:15:59] okay surely there's an enemy here right
[01:16:00] why am I lagging surely there's an enemy
[01:16:03] here right oh let me close again that's
[01:16:05] why
[01:16:10] wait what was that
[01:16:11] even support the inter-terrestrial peace
[01:16:14] Corporation
[01:16:15] what is the intro to us
[01:16:17] he's a three thousand bits oil
[01:16:21] oh yeah speaking of which we are giving
[01:16:23] out 25 codes through today's Stream So
[01:16:25] if you're watching wow you can get codes
[01:16:27] but we have to do challenges first in
[01:16:28] order to do that any tests on my blade
[01:16:29] and in order to do that I have to do an
[01:16:31] archon Quest so see you guys in six
[01:16:33] years
[01:16:34] but it's good content
[01:16:36] so I'm excited okay anyways let me show
[01:16:38] you guys something about blade
[01:16:40] thanks to the 3000 bits though let me
[01:16:41] show you guys things so let's say you
[01:16:42] have Lewis's field right
[01:16:44] let me show you let me show you
[01:16:46] I don't know if this is gonna work here
[01:16:48] but it should
[01:16:49] wait I need my blade to go okay wait
[01:16:56] right yeah
[01:17:01] I have a team of of you know two really
[01:17:04] cool five stars then you use your skill
[01:17:06] right
[01:17:07] look at what happens first of all Kaka
[01:17:12] then you attack
[01:17:18] what a headache wait my HP total is too
[01:17:21] low
[01:17:24] okay anyways attacking the field heals
[01:17:27] the back up but that's not the point the
[01:17:28] point is if your HP total is higher and
[01:17:30] you skill it removes a high enough
[01:17:32] percentage for Lewis to heal you but my
[01:17:34] HP tool is too low I didn't know if it
[01:17:36] would proc or not okay whatever I mean
[01:17:38] okay next turn you'll see you'll see
[01:17:40] next turn you'll see next turn
[01:17:44] you'll see next turn
[01:17:51] I think it's because other character
[01:17:53] attacked and heal them or some [ __ ] but
[01:17:54] look
[01:17:57] okay whatever this game sucks I need to
[01:17:59] be lower HP whatever you'll see you'll
[01:18:01] see when we actually build them he gets
[01:18:03] like interrupted to get healed by Lucha
[01:18:05] you'll see okay when he's fully feels if
[01:18:08] he okay if you're actually like he's
[01:18:10] built correctly right he uses his skill
[01:18:12] he goes down loses 30 HP then insta
[01:18:15] heals him
[01:18:16] wait does it scale on your Trace level
[01:18:18] is that why no it's always 30.
[01:18:21] yeah I think whatever when he's built
[01:18:23] it'll work okay when he's built
[01:18:26] when he's built it'll work also
[01:18:29] um for the record
[01:18:32] he doesn't scale on how low he is HP
[01:18:35] wise a lot of people in chat well a few
[01:18:37] people I saw were like don't you want to
[01:18:38] be low HP no he's not who Tau he does
[01:18:41] not care about being low HP he cares
[01:18:42] about how much damage he takes he's edgy
[01:18:44] okay basically he wants to hurt himself
[01:18:46] if he hurts himself he does more but he
[01:18:48] doesn't have to be Lloyd for you to do
[01:18:49] more so like you can fully heal him all
[01:18:52] the time and he'll do Max damage as long
[01:18:53] as he takes damage so don't run the
[01:18:55] shield
[01:18:56] he's like the opposite of hutao and
[01:18:58] Arlen so like for example you want to be
[01:19:00] shielded and you want to be low HP with
[01:19:01] him you want to be full HP but you want
[01:19:04] to take damage well you don't have to be
[01:19:06] full HP you could be any HP it doesn't
[01:19:07] matter but you just want to take damage
[01:19:09] that's all very different mcfriend rice
[01:19:12] from Hong Kong
[01:19:16] Smith doggo EXP
[01:19:18] that sounds like a promo so I don't
[01:19:20] really want to click on it but thanks

[01:19:33] intense
[01:19:35] okay chat
[01:19:37] I have a question that will determine
[01:19:39] the fate of the Stream
[01:19:42] am I spam skipping through it or am I
[01:19:44] watching it because I need the level
[01:19:46] blade but I also kinda care but I'm also

[01:20:08] she must have defined it
[01:20:11] time is of the essence the most
[01:20:13] important

[01:20:19] diviner with commanding the cloud

[01:29:39] never mind
[01:29:41] I assume what we want now correct me if
[01:29:44] I'm wrong but I assume we want blade to
[01:29:46] be a little bit faster than brania so
[01:29:48] that we go blade then bronya then blade
[01:29:50] goes again I think that's what we want
[01:29:52] our rotation to be you got me
[01:29:59] but I don't know I'm not a rotation
[01:30:01] crafter in this game I just play

[01:35:13] business did you want to hear that time
[01:35:14] for idle chat
[01:35:16] command
[01:35:20] it was only afterwards that we learned
[01:35:22] our enemies were none other than the
[01:35:23] disciples if everything was going as
[01:35:25] planned
[01:35:26] the Sorcerers of the disciples and the
[01:35:28] Fantastic creatures they commanded were
[01:35:29] no match for us
[01:35:31] and after a while
[01:35:34] our comrades suddenly started to
[01:35:36] slaughter one another
[01:35:42] [Music]

[01:36:01] why did
[01:36:03] and violated the rainbow's admonishments
[01:36:06] what the Disciples of Sanctus maticus
[01:36:09] did are despicable acts that every
[01:36:10] Alliance resident detests

[01:36:23] diviner you're back yeah I voice them oh

[01:36:29] but the deceit of the disciples has laid
[01:36:31] bare to me now
[01:36:36] I was mere
[01:36:39] according to my divination you've hardly
[01:36:41] been here long
[01:36:43] the conflict is difficult Master diviner
[01:36:45] but you have led your forces from the
[01:36:48] front lines and Beyond in pursuit of the
[01:36:50] enemy admirable work hardly
[01:36:55] School must acquire first-hand knowledge
[01:36:57] in order to calculate the future
[01:36:59] collecting intelligence in this way
[01:37:01] assists me in achieving the right answer
[01:37:05] what's all this about a difficult
[01:37:07] conflict
[01:37:10] she's as short as xyox no she's not I
[01:37:12] mean she's shorter but our army is in no
[01:37:15] way inferior
[01:37:17] how can things be so difficult
[01:37:23] is this a segue into joining into the
[01:37:25] Segway into US joining The Fray
[01:37:28] [Music]
[01:37:30] sharp as always
[01:37:33] spent too long around the master diviner
[01:37:35] now we're predicting the future
[01:37:39] let me guess what are we up to this time
[01:37:42] could it be heading to the front lines
[01:37:44] leading the cloud night charge
[01:37:48] well try this on for size
[01:37:51] nope I can't stand any more of this
[01:37:53] fighting so there
[01:37:56] who said you'd be heading to the
[01:37:58] battlefield yeah okay no disrespect I
[01:38:00] love March 5th but has she ever guessed
[01:38:03] anything correctly in the whole story by
[01:38:04] the way does anyone know has she ever
[01:38:06] guessed anything right I feel like every
[01:38:07] time she says something it's like
[01:38:11] he said that the value of unexpected no
[01:38:14] disrespect
[01:38:15] [Music]
[01:38:17] assault was to demonstrate our power to
[01:38:19] the enemy head-on
[01:38:21] now it is time for the unexpected please
[01:38:24] come with me okay
[01:38:27] why does foosh when Loki look like
[01:38:29] females
[01:38:30] she does not she does not look like
[01:38:33] female Xiao
[01:38:36] you take that back
[01:38:39] all right it's fine yeah right I'm
[01:38:42] tripping
[01:38:43] developing many incredible Technologies
[01:38:45] from the tree itself
[01:38:48] she looks like guy Miko no it's just the
[01:38:51] color palette I don't know
[01:38:52] of Life Research into the arbor poisoned
[01:38:56] their minds
[01:38:57] the more they pursued it
[01:38:59] [Music]
[01:39:01] morning bells chime in a dream evening
[01:39:04] Mist gathers around me
[01:39:06] space kakomi I feel like March 7th has
[01:39:10] more kokomi palette she has more of like
[01:39:12] the hair in front though she licks her
[01:39:14] crucibles
[01:39:15] still smoke
[01:39:19] this is where the Alchemists practice
[01:39:21] the way of immortality in ancient times
[01:39:24] they erected Elixir crucibles here to
[01:39:27] absorb the power of the Arbor
[01:39:29] turning fantasy into reality Harbor from
[01:39:32] valorant I love how the crucibles never
[01:39:34] ceases this place was named Eve Miss
[01:39:36] mansion
[01:39:38] An Elegant name but as far as the Art of
[01:39:42] War is concerned it's a death trap
[01:39:45] as long as the crucibles are lit and the
[01:39:47] smoke continues to linger we cannot get
[01:39:49] any closer
[01:39:52] her eyes look like Shadows no they don't
[01:39:54] you clearly have not spent enough time
[01:39:55] staring into xiao's eyes he does not
[01:39:57] have eyes like that
[01:39:59] maybe like the details a bit but the
[01:40:01] color is not even close his eyes are
[01:40:03] different
[01:40:04] dove with medicinal pellets that elicit
[01:40:07] Mara
[01:40:08] unless the cloud Knights were able to
[01:40:10] march with their breath held they would
[01:40:12] be doomed to fall into disarray
[01:40:15] moreover no one could know whether their
[01:40:18] comrade was about to be stricken with
[01:40:19] the cloud Knight's first assault was
[01:40:21] what are the codes dude okay I could
[01:40:24] technically give like five now but I'm
[01:40:26] supposed to do things to give them like
[01:40:28] that's the I got codes to give you guys
[01:40:30] after we do stuff together on stream
[01:40:32] okay I have to clear the simulated
[01:40:34] universe but I want to use blade and I
[01:40:37] can't use blade until I level him and I
[01:40:38] can't level him until I do this Quest so
[01:40:40] it's like
[01:40:41] I wanna I wanna get to that point but I
[01:40:45] have the level blade first because I'm
[01:40:47] not gonna not play blade so we have to
[01:40:50] get through this [ __ ] Quest the
[01:40:51] existence and capacity and Ensure
[01:40:55] smoke can affect us
[01:41:00] indeed
[01:41:01] this demonic vapor is a weapon targeted
[01:41:04] against the cloud Knights about nights
[01:41:07] taboo for the lawful okay and the Sea
[01:41:10] and Joe Alliance has always been
[01:41:11] fiercely independent
[01:41:13] the Disciples of Sanctus medication this
[01:41:16] play I'm at level 40 I could but then
[01:41:18] people would think okay they won't be
[01:41:20] prepared if I've played blade at level
[01:41:21] 40 people think blade sucks is this
[01:41:24] because I suck because he's not alone
[01:41:26] that's not his fault
[01:41:28] I wouldn't Hazard a guess
[01:41:31] all I can say is that the predictions of
[01:41:33] the Stellar on Hunters were more
[01:41:34] accurate than mine
[01:41:36] the future
[01:41:37] wait what did I skip the future that
[01:41:39] Kafka sees is becoming reality
[01:41:43] I could see that future with Kafka
[01:41:53] will find us and influence others okay
[01:41:55] the duty of the master diviner is to
[01:41:58] bring luck and avoid Misfortune okay
[01:42:00] return to the matter at hand
[01:42:02] [Music]
[01:42:03] douse The Elixir crucibles without being
[01:42:06] harmed by them

[02:01:06] yes yes you would
[02:01:10] Eternal States
[02:01:16] hahaha
[02:01:20] okay 64 x donated one dollar hey man was
[02:01:26] wondering hey man I think Kafka will be
[02:01:28] a good pairing with blade at all xqc I
[02:01:31] have no clue what the [ __ ] Kafka does
[02:01:33] yet
[02:01:34] I know what blade does yet
[02:01:40] but probably not but we'll see
[02:01:50] so you are afraid of me who's next
[02:01:55] you chose the wrong anime
[02:02:10] you played on the tutorial I mean yeah
[02:02:11] but does that mean I know what team
[02:02:14] she's gonna be random I don't know maybe
[02:02:16] you do
[02:02:17] I mean she looks like a damage dealer
[02:02:19] but I don't [ __ ] know what team's
[02:02:20] gonna be in
[02:02:21] I need the player first
[02:02:32] ah
[02:02:34] the flame we witnessed claimed to be
[02:02:36] Lord ravager fantilia a name I've heard
[02:02:39] other nameless speak of in the past
[02:02:43] she's one of seven Lord ravagers who
[02:02:46] serve Nanook and finds pleasure in
[02:02:49] witnessing the self-destruction of
[02:02:51] Mortals
[02:02:52] she's LED countless Souls you know
[02:02:56] what's possessed but surely she's fine
[02:02:57] right
[02:02:59] meaning that mean that thing you don't
[02:03:03] have wait never mind she wasn't she was
[02:03:05] just brainwashed
[02:03:08] I don't believe so wait fantilio Revels
[02:03:12] yeah wait shut up after this wait shut
[02:03:15] up shut up you kind of look like well
[02:03:18] achieved
[02:03:22] but there was no indication that Ting
[02:03:24] Yoon had been misguided or manipulated
[02:03:28] it's possible that the Ting Yoon we knew
[02:03:31] wasn't her true self but an image
[02:03:34] fantilia devised to serve her own wait
[02:03:37] what the [ __ ]
[02:03:40] wait no shot she's just evil
[02:03:47] [Music]
[02:03:51] Marge I can't say with any certainty
[02:03:53] where the real Ting Yoon may be or
[02:03:56] imposter imposter replaced by The
[02:03:58] Imposter
[02:03:59] imposter without knowing where the body
[02:04:01] vanished to it'll be tough to get an
[02:04:04] answer
[02:04:06] at this point it's all just conjecture
[02:04:09] and Hope
[02:04:10] but if that body belongs to real to noon
[02:04:14] it does raise the question of why
[02:04:16] fantilia would go to such lengths to
[02:04:18] destroy any evidence of her
[02:04:21] wouldn't it be more in line with her
[02:04:23] destructive nature to leave Ting yoon's
[02:04:25] remains behind as a Display of Power
[02:04:30] I believe this to be fantilia's goal to
[02:04:34] sow seeds of Doubt Among Us
[02:04:37] in a malevolence trap
[02:04:41] clear that the sudden Resurgence of the
[02:04:43] disciples
[02:04:44] connected to the Lord ravager pretending
[02:04:47] to be a CN Joe citizen planting a Stella
[02:04:50] RAM and a lawful all part of her plan to
[02:04:53] bring about our self-destruction
[02:04:56] ventilia is aiming for the ambrosial
[02:04:58] Arbor if she succeeds the lawful will be
[02:05:01] deprived of its roots wait so they just
[02:05:03] killed in yoon's Clone it was like we
[02:05:05] don't know real to noon we don't know
[02:05:07] where she is or who she is
[02:05:09] waterscape the ambrosial arbor can be
[02:05:12] sealed from that cell
[02:05:13] she's actually with me huh let's make
[02:05:15] haste sorry
[02:05:23] that imposter happened what worries me
[02:05:25] Morris
[02:05:27] just how many more anti-modern saboteurs
[02:05:30] are at Large
[02:05:36] certainly
[02:05:41] [Music]
[02:05:44] fascinated with the abundances creations
[02:05:48] since she was an amicaster dispatched by
[02:05:50] the sky fairing commission it's evident
[02:05:53] that there must indeed be a person with
[02:05:54] her name in the commission
[02:05:56] we'll have to let the cloud Knights get
[02:05:58] to the bottom of what happened to the
[02:05:59] real Ting you as for the Ting Yoon who
[02:06:02] accompanied us all that way it's like
[02:06:04] what Mr Yang said
[02:06:06] her appearance was designed to sow seeds
[02:06:08] of Doubt Among Us not again we cannot
[02:06:10] allow ourselves to fall into her trap
[02:06:13] why is it always Among Us
[02:06:25] sorry

[02:22:00] this world would be without quarrel
[02:22:03] if you wish to rid me of the illusion of
[02:22:06] dong Fung
[02:22:08] you must do something for me
[02:22:12] okay I think I get before I can let Don
[02:22:14] Fong die and revoke your banishment
[02:22:16] edict
[02:22:18] I need him to do me one final favor
[02:22:22] I can guarantee you that when it is done
[02:22:25] you will no longer walk in anyone's
[02:22:28] shadow aboard the lawful
[02:22:31] okay I may not be capable of the things
[02:22:33] that Dan Fung was capable of you must do
[02:22:37] it or my promise will come for naught
[02:22:40] if you wish to blame someone blame your
[02:22:43] previous incarnation
[02:22:45] had he not committed that terrible sin
[02:22:49] at the power of dragon transmutation
[02:22:51] been passed on intact
[02:22:53] Chad you remember the thing I was
[02:22:55] talking about last dream about how
[02:22:57] there's like characters who'll get like
[02:22:59] eight different names and then you don't
[02:23:00] know what they call them and then you're
[02:23:01] just like oh is it
[02:23:04] scarra or Wanderer or the [ __ ] six
[02:23:06] other names yeah yeah they're gonna make
[02:23:09] it like
[02:23:10] I don't know what's happening with that
[02:23:11] hug right now it is as I said
[02:23:14] here we stand so different from one
[02:23:16] another
[02:23:18] Don Fong is no more
[02:23:22] now there is only done hung I guess just
[02:23:26] a past form or some [ __ ] because he's
[02:23:28] just I'm the general of the love does
[02:23:31] that hung and then there's the other
[02:23:32] version of the Dragon one I wish I did
[02:23:33] not have to do
[02:23:35] and yet I must I think
[02:23:38] maybe I'm oversimplifying it
[02:23:42] let us talk of happier tidings
[02:23:44] the friends you made on the express are
[02:23:46] here
[02:23:48] do you wish to see them
[02:23:51] you brought them here
[02:23:55] wait his [ __ ] easel
[02:23:58] is that Canadian go wait kazua
[02:24:03] [ __ ]
[02:24:05] your friends are waiting for you
[02:24:07] it's literally a leaf
[02:24:11] I have been keeping the hunt the castle
[02:24:13] of HSR true we find ourselves at War
[02:24:18] why are people calling Dad hung to the
[02:24:21] kazua of star rail
[02:24:24] hey guys welcome to my update
[02:24:28] oh [ __ ]
[02:24:37] yo
[02:24:42] that's pretty cool
[02:24:45] our intelligence tells us that the
[02:24:47] legion are a mad and destructive War
[02:24:50] Machine he said [ __ ] it I'm nearly
[02:24:52] against the alliance
[02:24:54] the armies of the seven ravagers all
[02:24:57] have their own means you scored a drop
[02:24:59] whoa whoa okay I'm actually getting
[02:25:00] drops okay cool I wasn't sure if I was
[02:25:02] like are they on yet or not I just gotta
[02:25:03] drop so that means they're on fog codes
[02:25:06] will come after the quest
[02:25:09] whoa zox thanks for the Lord ravager
[02:25:12] fantaria favors internal collapse which
[02:25:15] is why she masterminded the stellaron
[02:25:18] crisis and urged the Disciples of
[02:25:20] Sanctus Medicus Out of the Shadows
[02:25:23] now that her plot has been laid bare she
[02:25:27] has no choice but to retreat
[02:25:29] and yet that hardly suits her philosophy
[02:25:31] of Destruction
[02:25:33] there must be something more
[02:25:42] is this
[02:25:45] you know what I growing up I learned to
[02:25:47] mind my own business and if it doesn't
[02:25:49] concern me I just looked the other way
[02:25:50] okay that's that's how you have to move
[02:25:52] around here like every time I go to New
[02:25:55] York I see a lot of things I pretend I
[02:25:57] don't see them I'm not gonna talk to
[02:25:58] that well investigate this though do you
[02:26:00] know I'm begging you call him by his
[02:26:02] name in Bible too it's so cool I can't
[02:26:04] what's imbibator
[02:26:07] strongly for him to be destroyed
[02:26:10] the videodera on the other hand
[02:26:13] were split evenly in their favor and
[02:26:15] disfavor of the motion
[02:26:18] the dragon transmutation inheritance was
[02:26:21] not intact after the video were under
[02:26:24] great pressure
[02:26:25] in order to play Cape the ten Lords in
[02:26:28] Sky fairing commissions
[02:26:30] okay this is so much
[02:26:33] I'm really trying like genuinely
[02:26:36] focus on on all of this
[02:26:41] summarize it
[02:26:45] the scene
[02:26:47] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:26:50] I'm trying I'm trying I'm I'm trying
[02:26:54] oh it's all it's everyone look
[02:26:57] your friends are taking the fight to the
[02:26:59] legion as we speak we need to help them
[02:27:02] let's go
[02:27:07] wait how is he fighting
[02:27:13] how did he fight the enemies before
[02:27:15] seeing his friends because the friends
[02:27:17] are in front of the enemies but we're in
[02:27:18] combat with them so all good
[02:27:21] wait did
[02:27:24] we just use three skill points though
[02:27:26] I'm pretty sure we did right because now
[02:27:27] if we attacked minus three
[02:27:31] this is our chance yeah okay wait no we
[02:27:33] still have wait what we saw skill points
[02:27:38] I don't know I feel like it should be
[02:27:40] minus three but we still have still
[02:27:41] points I don't know
[02:27:47] it enhances based on how many times you
[02:27:49] press it yeah I pressed it three times
[02:27:50] wait press press search
[02:27:57] oh in this story he doesn't use okay it
[02:27:59] makes sense
[02:28:00] yeah that makes sense
[02:28:04] oh yeah I thought
[02:28:06] I saw this like I saw it like change
[02:28:07] animations but
[02:28:11] look at the stacks under him
[02:28:16] yeah yeah it stack doesn't use it but I
[02:28:18] assume in the non-story version you use
[02:28:20] the skill points
[02:28:23] wait now we have three though one two
[02:28:26] three but last time we had zero I don't
[02:28:28] know I think it's the story of things
[02:28:30] follow my charge I didn't mean to do
[02:28:33] that oops
[02:28:44] [Music]
[02:28:47] okay one
[02:28:49] two should we try the second one
[02:28:51] okay let's try the second one
[02:28:55] oh that's sick okay did he shot a spear
[02:29:05] sorry
[02:29:06] um Sorry rules are made to be broken
[02:29:13] well I don't do that
[02:29:17] oh
[02:29:26] slow it down sure
[02:29:33] he literally against [ __ ] dragons
[02:29:37] [Music]
[02:29:41] I speak for everyone when I say we will
[02:29:43] be pulling
[02:29:44] forgive my late arrival also okay I'm
[02:29:47] gonna ask this now but this lasts for
[02:29:49] the whole stream if there's any
[02:29:51] incredible
[02:29:53] on uh that hung not then hung on blades
[02:29:58] um
[02:29:59] inert versus Inner Cell soda versus the
[02:30:01] new two-piece send it to me because I've
[02:30:04] seen the the math before it's out but I
[02:30:07] don't know if anything's changed like
[02:30:09] I've done them I've also done the math
[02:30:11] on my end I'm papega but I've also done
[02:30:12] it in on what I thought the rotation is
[02:30:15] but I don't know if the rotation changed
[02:30:16] because I'm not the best at rotations in
[02:30:18] a game that I I don't know as much as
[02:30:19] gunshin
[02:30:20] okay that's all the ambrosial Arbor
[02:30:23] that's her Focus
[02:30:26] Lord ravager fantilia's strategy was to
[02:30:28] create civil Strife then let it consume
[02:30:31] the C and Joe from within
[02:30:35] oh once you're not done talking I'm
[02:30:37] sorry
[02:30:38] Friends of the astral Express
[02:30:40] I have brought someone with me whom I
[02:30:43] think you'll be eager to see that's
[02:30:45] actually my toxic trait my toxic trait
[02:30:47] is thinking people are done talking when
[02:30:49] they take a break like a pause in their
[02:30:51] sentence because my brain can't fathom
[02:30:54] empty space between words
[02:30:56] I'm getting better but it sometimes
[02:30:59] there's like a pause and it's like
[02:31:02] you are
[02:31:03] you are hung right
[02:31:05] and what's with the horns
[02:31:08] it's a long story March
[02:31:13] it's me Rudolph the Red Nose reigned
[02:31:17] you do have secret strength
[02:31:21] boy let us save such reminiscence
[02:31:27] my astral guests
[02:31:29] when you first appeared on the lawful
[02:31:31] your stated aim was the resolution of
[02:31:34] the stellaron crisis
[02:31:36] [Music]
[02:31:43] I see now that I was overly angry guys
[02:31:46] where's Ting Yoon oh uh she's she's here
[02:31:49] about that she's here yeah no worries no
[02:31:51] worries she's here we just uh she
[02:31:52] actually went to the mall to buy a new
[02:31:55] fan because she wanted a different one
[02:31:57] so don't worry about her don't worry
[02:31:59] about don't worry she'll be back it is
[02:32:02] true that the motives of the stelaron
[02:32:04] hunters were not what they appeared
[02:32:09] in order that the Express and the sienjo
[02:32:11] fight side by side
[02:32:13] Kafka lured you here
[02:32:16] of the crisis
[02:32:19] in doing so
[02:32:21] she succeeds guys I gotta Focus there's
[02:32:22] so much text sincerity is beyond doubt
[02:32:25] okay
[02:32:26] the lawful is in your debt
[02:32:28] and I have no right to seek further
[02:32:30] assistance from you
[02:32:34] okay the people who just joined she
[02:32:35] didn't die she just I'm not she's just
[02:32:38] not here for a reason she's just not
[02:32:40] here but she's not dead
[02:32:42] as lady Foo as explained
[02:32:44] the appearance of phantalia means dude I
[02:32:47] love you during your ends but why do you
[02:32:48] talk in essays
[02:32:51] as general of the law Foo
[02:32:54] that's the 300 bits right I appreciate
[02:32:56] it not to ask
[02:33:02] crisis on the law Foo had nothing to do
[02:33:05] with the stellaron I would be willing to
[02:33:07] help but I can't speak for the other
[02:33:09] members of my crew explore understand
[02:33:12] establish and connect as the crew of The
[02:33:16] Express that's the trailblaze Creed we

[02:33:33] there three ones the obstacles we face
[02:33:35] in
[02:33:37] and that's why the nameless who are able
[02:33:39] to whether our destination lies before
[02:33:41] us or behind us the decision is ours to
[02:33:44] make here as on the express every vote

[02:51:11] out come early tomorrow probably I'm
[02:51:14] gonna finish it tonight
[02:51:26] I understand your misgivings but my
[02:51:29] decision is made
[02:51:30] that is the course we must take this
[02:51:32] looks like that home
[02:51:36] very well in that case I will report you
[02:51:40] to the presenters and have you stripped
[02:51:42] of the name and power of the high Elder
[02:51:45] enconomia recycle a luckily for me I've
[02:51:48] never done anything else
[02:51:50] first High Elder that accepted the
[02:51:52] mission to quell the ambrosial Arbor
[02:51:56] according to tradition from then on
[02:51:59] successive High Elders were obliged to
[02:52:01] return to the dragon Vista rain Hall
[02:52:03] the tides of the ancient sea to guard
[02:52:06] and strengthen the arbor seal
[02:52:10] who you remember now
[02:52:14] reverence to the three talents the path
[02:52:17] to the great roots
[02:52:19] the way to the root depths
[02:52:22] is that some kind of riddle
[02:52:25] reverence to the three
[02:52:27] lens
[02:52:29] what the heck does that mean
[02:52:32] don't worry about it just follow me yeah
[02:52:35] this guy's fed up with March he does not
[02:52:37] care Alice you're like man she's too
[02:52:40] dumb I'm not even gonna explain it don't
[02:52:42] worry just follow me
[02:52:49] I would never abandon you march
[02:52:52] it must have been a necessary sacrifice
[02:53:06] president okay cool I don't need to read
[02:53:09] that this is mentioned in the riddle
[02:53:11] one [ __ ] I should have read that
[02:53:13] if we can break the seal here we'll be a
[02:53:15] step closer to the roots of the Arbor
[02:53:23] okay I don't know what the [ __ ] to do so
[02:53:25] let me actually read it okay uh wait
[02:53:27] what
[02:53:51] turns are different
[02:53:58] wait it's how they're lit up this is one
[02:54:04] that's one
[02:54:05] this is two
[02:54:13] three
[02:54:17] this is far
[02:54:28] it worked it worked in general did you
[02:54:33] hear about missed immune
[02:54:35] she's fine what do you mean I think it's
[02:54:39] fine Tilly's infiltration along with a
[02:54:42] meticulous planet
[02:54:44] makes her extremely difficult I think
[02:54:46] it's cool what about her did you ask
[02:54:48] about me carry out an investigation but
[02:54:51] for now our most pressing matter is to
[02:54:54] put a stop to futilious scheme
[02:54:57] did I go the wrong way oh I should have
[02:54:59] just continued it's fine
[02:55:10] dude she's not dead
[02:55:13] she's not
[02:55:20] already a monkey
[02:55:34] oh wow I'm late in my team but I really
[02:55:36] thought about it
[02:55:48] time for a bug
[02:55:53] time for a bug
[02:56:17] why have people been saying time for a
[02:56:19] bug in all caps no space is there any
[02:56:21] Mode called time for a bug that I don't
[02:56:23] know of any connection
[02:56:27] wait why can't I see them
[02:56:31] use the function below
[02:56:34] function
[02:56:36] what one two those three one four two
[02:56:42] three one four two wait but there's
[02:56:45] pairs wait why are there pairs are this
[02:56:47] all muscles of click on [ __ ] okay so
[02:56:54] okay I have a photogenic memory watches
[02:56:57] my memory is photosynthetic I'm not
[02:56:59] gonna open the map again I memorized it
[02:57:02] I don't remember which one two is I'm
[02:57:04] gonna I wonder if it has any
[02:57:10] did you notice the flag okay otherwise
[02:57:14] so this was okay one more time one more
[02:57:16] time
[02:57:20] connection to the seal one
[02:57:28] the creature was stepping on
[02:57:30] there's no other one right there's any
[02:57:31] connection
[02:57:37] is this not two
[02:57:39] oh wait my camera's [ __ ] wait
[02:57:42] wait okay my camera is different okay
[02:57:44] wait so where is actually north so this
[02:57:47] is North which means that one is
[02:57:50] like here right
[02:57:52] yeah okay okay that's why that's why my
[02:57:53] camera was [ __ ] okay so this is one
[02:57:56] that's why
[02:57:57] then two is
[02:57:59] here
[02:58:06] and then three was I'm not gonna put my
[02:58:08] map I know this three was one of these
[02:58:10] two it was it even it was this one that
[02:58:12] was this one
[02:58:16] another four
[02:58:21] foreign
[02:58:24] thanks to the new code
[02:58:26] I'm also giving out codes throughout the
[02:58:28] stream like after this Quest as we do
[02:58:30] challenges hashtag ad but thank you
[02:58:32] coming much for coming in clutch
[02:58:39] my pin message was better though
[02:58:42] someone said genuine
[02:58:45] speaks in gentian skills
[02:58:47] in gechen's skill descriptions that's
[02:58:50] what he said
[02:58:52] uh
[02:58:56] but I don't care enough
[02:59:02] okay let me put blade in my team
[02:59:16] wait what how do I get there bro oh wait
[02:59:19] I can go from there right
[02:59:20] Shirley
[02:59:24] surely I can go from here right yeah
[02:59:37] the arbor is near but until you will
[02:59:40] soon have control of the order
[02:59:44] wait why did that pin message disappear
[02:59:58] okay okay okay okay okay I will be able
[03:00:01] to level up late I believe
[03:00:04] oh God there's another puzzle
[03:00:10] that sign won't stop me because I can't
[03:00:12] read
[03:00:14] no I need to do it okay uh
[03:00:17] ding dong no that's not a bell
[03:00:19] are there any things on the ground no is
[03:00:22] there a map I can use no
[03:00:24] [ __ ] it we just random it
[03:00:33] what seems to be the problem Frank
[03:00:36] it would appear the seals have you at a
[03:00:39] loss
[03:00:41] could the murals in our vicinity be
[03:00:43] related to the seals
[03:00:48] what
[03:00:50] three
[03:00:52] three two baby
[03:00:56] okay this one's a baby wait but this one
[03:00:57] has nothing surely you start with the
[03:00:59] one that I was not wait no this one has
[03:01:00] surely we start with the baby
[03:01:03] baby
[03:01:05] and then we do the
[03:01:06] um the the the the Priestess and the
[03:01:09] priest
[03:01:12] seems to be the price
[03:01:14] okay wait let me let me think okay so it
[03:01:16] would appear the seals have you at a
[03:01:18] loss
[03:01:20] could the murals in our vicinity be
[03:01:22] related to the seals
[03:01:27] I'm gonna solve this I'm not looking at
[03:01:28] a chat this is clearly a windstorm
[03:01:43] oh you can investigate them
[03:01:45] bro
[03:01:47] this mural portrays the video that we're
[03:01:49] young
[03:01:50] they acquire knowledge this mural must
[03:01:53] be related to the others here hey do you
[03:01:56] think this perhaps
[03:01:57] okay so this is Young this is Young what
[03:02:00] about this one this is a baby surely
[03:02:01] this is a baby sure this is the start of
[03:02:03] Lion King
[03:02:08] okay this is what I was right I [ __ ]
[03:02:11] told you I was right I told you one
[03:02:15] two
[03:02:18] [Music]
[03:02:20] what seems to be the problem Frank
[03:02:24] wait it would appear this are you
[03:02:26] [ __ ]
[03:02:28] okay let me read this one maybe there's
[03:02:30] a baby in the middle
[03:02:33] as the day is almost gone the worldly
[03:02:36] limit of the fatihadra is reached after
[03:02:38] seven centuries
[03:02:40] yeah this is the end that's the end
[03:02:46] our reincarnations the mural depicts the
[03:02:49] video out of our being Guided by them oh
[03:02:51] being Guided by the Elder wait a second
[03:02:57] wait what
[03:03:03] and as did the worldly limit of the
[03:03:05] fitiatva is reached after seven
[03:03:06] centuries
[03:03:08] they return to the ancient sea and form
[03:03:10] a shell
[03:03:11] or Michelle awaiting the next rebirth
[03:03:14] what did this one say it was a
[03:03:17] beneath the lunar gloa door
[03:03:20] videodera X begins to form this mural
[03:03:23] describes the video out of a hatching
[03:03:24] rebirth in the lunarescent depth
[03:03:31] there was this one this is Young right
[03:03:37] okay and then the last one is did I do
[03:03:39] this one I don't remember
[03:03:42] our reincarnation's greatest mural
[03:03:45] depicts the video out of our being okay
[03:03:46] easy okay
[03:03:49] so that's the last one that's the one
[03:03:51] before that this one I don't [ __ ]
[03:03:53] know so I'm gonna guess it's two
[03:03:57] investigate
[03:04:07] this has to be two if not it's that one
[03:04:10] what seems to be okay that is this one
[03:04:13] it's one and then two there there's a
[03:04:14] few of the seals this has to be one
[03:04:16] literally on my money that's one so then
[03:04:18] this has to be two
[03:04:22] what seems to be the problem okay this
[03:04:24] game sucks okay maybe that's not one
[03:04:26] maybe this one's one it would appear the
[03:04:27] seals heavy what a loss
[03:04:33] wait how is the elder one to them
[03:04:37] [ __ ] it I'm Brute Force again I don't
[03:04:39] care but how is this one too okay
[03:04:40] explain it explain how this one's too
[03:04:42] that doesn't even make sense
[03:04:45] okay yo how listen read it nation's
[03:04:49] greatest cost
[03:04:51] a wisdom of a past mural depicts the
[03:04:53] videographer being
[03:04:55] got Elder oh after the rebirth okay I
[03:04:57] didn't read the last two words I read
[03:04:59] the first part because I'm I'm speed
[03:05:01] running a speedrunner is not gonna read
[03:05:03] the last words wait what was this one
[03:05:05] then that one was the shell so then this
[03:05:07] one's third what seems to be the problem
[03:05:10] friend
[03:05:13] okay cool
[03:05:15] shut up
[03:05:16] I was doing that on purpose that was it
[03:05:18] on purpose
[03:05:20] I was acting
[03:05:27] what seems to be the
[03:05:40] okay if I just read everything slowly
[03:05:42] and calmly okay maybe we could have
[03:05:45] progressed faster but you never like
[03:05:47] I would rather try to be to do something
[03:05:51] super fast and then if I don't we must
[03:05:54] hurry
[03:05:55] at least I tried wait what there's an
[03:05:57] egg here okay cool
[03:06:10] I feel like it's gonna fight scene let's
[03:06:12] wait
[03:06:12] [Music]
[03:06:21] we've reached the end
[03:06:23] these are the roots of the ambrosial
[03:06:25] arbor where the vestiges of abundance
[03:06:27] lie reverence to the three talents
[03:06:30] the path to the great roots
[03:06:33] this is it
[03:06:35] under the power of the high Elder the
[03:06:38] Arbor's Roots have formed into the image
[03:06:40] of a dragon

[03:22:10] the disruption of the sienjo
[03:22:13] is

[03:22:51] efforts
[03:22:58] thank you
[03:23:00] a truly fearsome enemy
[03:23:03] if she hadn't attempted to turn me into
[03:23:05] a pawn of Destruction
[03:23:07] I'm afraid Victory would have been far
[03:23:10] from certain
[03:23:13] fantilia had established a link between
[03:23:16] me and herself
[03:23:18] her world-time strike Gravely injured
[03:23:20] her
[03:23:21] thus
[03:23:23] her connection to the arbor was severed
[03:23:31] to death
[03:23:34] yeah she's not dead
[03:23:39] it takes more than that to destroy and
[03:23:42] emanator
[03:23:43] of Destruction
[03:23:47] fantilia won't be stirring up trouble
[03:23:49] anytime soon don't worry about her
[03:23:52] infecting the arbor again it's just that
[03:23:54] way no disrespect but there's been about
[03:23:57] like four or five cutscenes of of big
[03:24:00] fights what the [ __ ] have we done what
[03:24:02] has marched on and what has well done
[03:24:04] they've not they haven't even
[03:24:06] contributed
[03:24:08] we're just standing there last fight we
[03:24:11] got a new element we became path of
[03:24:13] Destruction the fire a shield fire
[03:24:16] protection not a destruction whatever
[03:24:18] the [ __ ] that's called
[03:24:20] what do we do this time
[03:24:25] in preservation same thing
[03:24:30] what do we do this time
[03:24:36] a few moments later and the cloud
[03:24:39] Knights arrived a start
[03:24:46] are there other matters
[03:24:51] that's it
[03:24:54] okay don't get me wrong Amazing Story
[03:24:57] amazing soundtrack but why would you ask
[03:24:59] them
[03:25:01] where is take Yoon
[03:25:04] where's to you
[03:25:08] soon
[03:25:10] I miss her
[03:25:17] I can't look at her the same anymore
[03:25:23] she sees us
[03:25:30] foreign
[03:25:36] hey uh okay so
[03:25:40] you guys get drops just by watching the
[03:25:42] stream but I also have 25 codes to give
[03:25:45] out this this stream that gives 60 Jades
[03:25:47] but they're only one Redemption so it's
[03:25:49] like kind of like I'm trying not to like
[03:25:51] over hype it because it's only one
[03:25:52] person's gonna get each well 25 people
[03:25:54] but we're just still a thing to give out
[03:25:56] so yeah uh also there's a code for
[03:25:59] everyone that was pinned earlier like a
[03:26:00] actual code for everyone but I don't
[03:26:03] know where it went so if anyone has it
[03:26:04] post that but yeah I have some to give
[03:26:07] out but I have to do like challenges to
[03:26:09] give them because that's what it is or
[03:26:12] if I wanna so okay here's what it is
[03:26:14] clearing the story Quest lets me give
[03:26:16] out five
[03:26:18] clearing simulated Universe with 10 hot
[03:26:20] blessings let me guess that five ten
[03:26:22] abundance blessings which is bad as [ __ ]
[03:26:24] let me guess that five using blade to be
[03:26:27] entranced by Kafka so getting dominated
[03:26:29] by Kafka that's five and then there's
[03:26:32] another thing for five but it's like
[03:26:34] scuffed so instead I could just give
[03:26:36] them now
[03:26:38] I could also skip all of those and if I
[03:26:40] clear the simulated universe with an
[03:26:43] astral Express member and the stream's
[03:26:46] over two hours and I can give them all
[03:26:47] so I think I'll just do that but I'll
[03:26:50] get five for now for doing this now I
[03:26:52] don't know how to do it though I don't
[03:26:53] know if I should just randomly like post
[03:26:55] them in chat or if I should put them on
[03:26:57] screen one by one
[03:26:59] or if I should like give like but I I
[03:27:02] don't know I'll figure it out but let me
[03:27:03] go [ __ ] do world seven first
[03:27:06] no off the level blade okay wait let me
[03:27:08] do it while I Auto Battle
[03:27:09] how do you redeem them I mean in-game
[03:27:11] you just gotta [ __ ] redeem
[03:27:16] um
[03:27:17] so there's a thing I know how to do like
[03:27:19] actual giveaways but I don't want to
[03:27:21] roll like a bunch of Chatter's names
[03:27:22] just for like
[03:27:25] I feel like if I'm gonna do a giveaway
[03:27:26] like if I'm gonna cause his name I don't
[03:27:29] want it to just be like one code type of
[03:27:31] thing like if I were to do that I would
[03:27:32] I would give more
[03:27:56] oh I have to do every difficulty wait
[03:27:58] you get a [ __ ] herder
[03:28:01] why don't you get a blade
[03:28:15] okay sorry all right let me Auto Battle
[03:28:18] um this stuff just so he levels up just
[03:28:21] because we want to level him we'll Auto
[03:28:22] Battle this while I do this
[03:28:27] do difficulty one then difficulty four
[03:28:28] and that's it
[03:28:30] I mean surely it's still worth to do the
[03:28:31] others for the free [ __ ] right
[03:28:33] [Music]
[03:28:37] Kuru Kuru
[03:28:41] okay let me just Auto Battle this
[03:28:43] enemies
[03:28:45] uh
[03:28:51] if you do difficulty for it gives you
[03:28:53] all of them wait that's sick I didn't
[03:28:56] know that
[03:28:57] that's really cool that's a sick
[03:28:58] mechanic
[03:29:00] okay sounds are a little loud
[03:29:10] um
[03:29:11] [ __ ]
[03:29:19] wait let me figure this out
[03:29:30] give me two seconds
[03:29:40] crush them
[03:29:42] so this is the code that everyone can
[03:29:44] get and then because you're watching
[03:29:47] xylox stream and I have to give out 25
[03:29:48] codes I'm randomly posting one in chat
[03:29:51] now that you're not expecting but only
[03:29:52] one person can claim that one so good
[03:29:54] luck to whoever got it so that's minus
[03:29:56] 124 left
[03:30:02] who's next
[03:30:03] minus one
[03:30:12] definitely insta yeah people are waiting
[03:30:18] to the Past
[03:30:21] someone said got it POG POG if true
[03:30:34] lengthen your strength
[03:30:37] okay so here's the thing I could do the
[03:30:41] nightbot that like rolls giveaways right
[03:30:43] I could but the only problem is like if
[03:30:46] I'm doing that usually like I would want
[03:30:48] to give more but it's just like because
[03:30:50] I have to do 24 different times so I
[03:30:52] don't know
[03:30:55] it's better
[03:30:57] okay sure
[03:31:10] to be fair yeah yeah sure sure that's
[03:31:12] fair
[03:31:24] um
[03:31:25] but how the [ __ ] do I set this up
[03:31:33] [Music]
[03:31:41] lending your strength okay wait so it's
[03:31:49] keyword
[03:31:50] okay we can answer a keyword
[03:31:53] s regulars what dude I make Subs get
[03:31:56] less luck
[03:31:57] no no no no no
[03:32:00] usually I would do this to make people
[03:32:01] want to sub but not enough for this one
[03:32:03] I'll just do normal
[03:32:04] okay cool I figured it out
[03:32:07] let me figure out the word
[03:32:18] oh I can make mods eligible sure mods
[03:32:21] eligible too [ __ ] it
[03:32:30] keep in mind first of all this isn't
[03:32:33] like a huge giveaway it's just 60 uh
[03:32:34] JC's code but they were doing a lot of
[03:32:36] codes uh
[03:32:37] so that's why I don't like
[03:32:40] the idea of rolling a giveaway because
[03:32:41] it feels it more than it is but
[03:32:44] it's only in the Stream because hashtag
[03:32:47] ad so what we're gonna do is I'm Gonna
[03:32:49] Roll
[03:32:49] okay there's a filter called anti-spam
[03:32:52] so if you type the code like let's say
[03:32:56] the code is like
[03:32:59] ziox is so cool tall five five five five
[03:33:02] like let's say that right if you type
[03:33:04] this once you're in if you type it twice
[03:33:06] you're out so only type it once okay
[03:33:07] that's what this does
[03:33:14] uh keywords gonna be
[03:33:25] um
[03:33:26] are you sure I'll just message the
[03:33:28] person I'll just DM them on Twitch I'll
[03:33:30] DM the code on Twitch probably
[03:33:33] if that works I don't know how the [ __ ]
[03:33:34] did you have on Twitch but I'll try wait
[03:33:36] let me see if I can
[03:33:38] received
[03:33:40] well how do you DM someone that's not

[03:43:41] one non-auto battle we'll do an actual
[03:43:43] fight this team still was kind of not
[03:43:45] the best here though but no one else in
[03:43:47] our team is I mean we could use
[03:43:48] [ __ ] it we'll just

[03:45:20] right let's just double all of them
[03:45:32] [Music]
[03:45:37] oh we'll get them all to the point where

[03:46:06] distance is Timely
[03:46:19] [Music]
[03:46:28] I said sorry
[03:46:32] we're gonna skill first because our Ulta
[03:46:35] sets us at 50 HP so we don't want to
[03:46:36] lose much never mind luatra I [ __ ]
[03:46:38] forgot about the ultra all right well we
[03:46:40] should all did earlier but it's fine
[03:46:45] the paradise must savor it for me I
[03:46:49] forgot about it

[03:47:15] I did not quit a single time
[03:47:25] why the [ __ ] is new enemy so hot yeah
[03:47:28] it's getting all over again like the
[03:47:29] aeromites
[03:47:31] okay unfortunately I'm playing an AOE
[03:47:33] carry in a situation where there's no
[03:47:35] other enemy
[03:47:36] all good though
[03:47:38] I think we just thought about this at
[03:47:40] this point
[03:47:46] to the 10 months I appreciate it
[03:47:53] this blade is so [ __ ] sick I mean his
[03:47:55] old is so sick and his follow-up attack
[03:47:57] is so sick
[03:48:05] wasn't there there wasn't there didn't
[03:48:08] they just say we fixed
[03:48:10] bronia's AI skill and Auto Battle
[03:48:15] received divinity
[03:48:17] the highest attack okay sure but
[03:48:20] brochure
[03:48:22] like I get yeah
[03:48:42] sorry
[03:48:45] savor it for me
[03:48:52] okay
[03:48:55] uh we have to dude I'm gonna use legit
[03:48:56] every fuel I have by the way for the
[03:48:58] record we're spamming our fuel on blade
[03:49:00] today but first we spent Jades
[03:49:10] may I know what are the codes no
[03:49:12] [Laughter]
[03:49:16] yeah Chad wrote the one that's shared
[03:49:18] and then we give away the like one time
[03:49:20] usage one throughout the Stream
[03:49:28] [Music]
[03:49:33] the new speed set is the emblem of HSR
[03:49:36] okay but the new Blade Set is the
[03:49:39] Vermilion of HSR and you guys can't wait
[03:49:41] for me to farm that wait wait till I get
[03:49:44] a hold of the new Vermillion just you
[03:49:47] wait
[03:49:54] just you wait
[03:49:59] it literally is
[03:50:04] it literally is the blade Vermilion
[03:50:10] okay
[03:50:17] they had returned
[03:50:22] you can Auto HSR and farm Vermilion two
[03:50:25] games at the same time don't give me
[03:50:28] ideas
[03:50:39] I farm Vermillion in two games at once
[03:50:42] this is what happens
[03:50:44] hey what's up guys
[03:50:52] know any good play teams that don't use
[03:50:54] the water or silver roll no yeah
[03:50:56] actually blade like lowkey can use any
[03:50:58] team he doesn't [ __ ] care bronya is
[03:51:00] his favorite support and luo saves her a
[03:51:02] Healer but you could just do like if
[03:51:04] you're free to play you do Pila
[03:51:07] Natasha Asta and then you can upgrade
[03:51:10] those characters depending on like who
[03:51:12] you have and stuff
[03:51:15] so you're
[03:51:20] fill point every three turns so you have
[03:51:23] room for like a sub DPS which usually is
[03:51:25] like a Hillary support right or like
[03:51:27] like you can do Harmony stuff what you
[03:51:29] usually want like usually you like
[03:51:31] Harmony
[03:51:32] healer but like
[03:51:34] you don't have to do that you're gonna
[03:51:35] do bra near The Witcher than any
[03:51:37] character in the game literally any
[03:51:38] [ __ ] character but not a shield don't
[03:51:40] run a shield of them
[03:51:44] can I run by Lou yeah if you don't do it
[03:51:46] it's fine it's nothing major
[03:51:56] what relics does my guide will be out
[03:51:58] tomorrow morning because it's being
[03:52:00] edited tonight but tldr crit is the best
[03:52:04] then you want HP and speed well okay
[03:52:06] speed depends
[03:52:07] it always [ __ ] depends you can go for
[03:52:09] 134 or whatever breakpoint you're going
[03:52:10] for but if you're running brania you
[03:52:12] might not need it or you could go speed
[03:52:14] bronya and speed that uh blade it's like
[03:52:17] weird same with like if you're running
[03:52:18] after it always is weird
[03:52:21] but generally speaking of like go speed
[03:52:22] but then if you're running Brown you
[03:52:24] don't you don't have to go speed you can
[03:52:26] you don't need to
[03:52:28] and then HP and then attack HP is better
[03:52:30] than times
[03:52:36] but as I said earlier in the Stream
[03:52:40] if there's any updated math on which
[03:52:42] two-piece planner is better for him and
[03:52:44] lycon off let me know and send them to
[03:52:46] me because I've done some and like the
[03:52:49] other people have done some but before
[03:52:50] he came out so I don't know if some
[03:52:52] stuff is skewed
[03:52:53] but it seems like uh inertia Soto and
[03:52:56] his Signet like the new world seven one
[03:52:58] are like about as good like very like
[03:53:00] just stops that depending
[03:53:01] because he uses follow-up attacks and
[03:53:03] ALT and they're both pretty good but he
[03:53:04] also spams basically or like enhanced
[03:53:07] biscuit dogs
[03:53:09] so they're like very similar
[03:53:15] for me
[03:53:22] wind damage or HP wind damage
[03:53:30] Fleet of the Aegis is good too but it's
[03:53:33] never gonna be like his personal best
[03:53:35] slot it's it's fine like it gives you HP
[03:53:37] and it Buster team so like if you're
[03:53:39] running another carry it's better and if
[03:53:41] you're
[03:53:43] if you have better soft spots on it you
[03:53:44] can use it but it's not like better for
[03:53:46] him than the other two
[03:53:59] let me check something
[03:54:17] [ __ ] it receive receivability
[03:54:21] can I run the bypass that Dad hung and
[03:54:23] blade on it uh look if you want to run
[03:54:27] it for like your own visual pleasure
[03:54:29] sure
[03:54:30] should you run it no no you shouldn't it
[03:54:33] gives like no stats
[03:54:34] like arlins is like 20 million times
[03:54:37] better
[03:54:41] even the three star icons better the one
[03:54:43] that gets crittery whatever it's called
[03:54:55] yeah
[03:54:56] maybe I should put silly in this team
[03:54:59] cute
[03:55:03] yeah
[03:55:04] secret battle sounds good that's Arlen's
[03:55:07] one right I always forget the names but
[03:55:08] I'm pretty sure that's Ireland's one
[03:55:09] yeah it's good
[03:55:11] his weapon okay his weapon is is his
[03:55:14] weapon the best then arlins and
[03:55:16] technically Karas
[03:55:17] but
[03:55:19] usually you use powers on someone on
[03:55:21] Clara but if you have it you can use it
[03:55:23] and then the three star
[03:55:25] and the the one in heard his show up is
[03:55:28] like similar to the three-star one at S5
[03:55:30] if you have get up time
[03:55:38] but again
[03:55:41] I am going to be redoing the numbers on
[03:55:43] those because I don't fully trust it so
[03:55:45] like wait a little bit but like that's
[03:55:48] the general ranking
[03:55:51] foreign
[03:56:06] ature weapon worth it you have Arlen's
[03:56:08] S5 then probably not but if not then
[03:56:11] sure depends how many J jobs
[03:56:23] are we done wait how many do I need 30
[03:56:25] right so we're not done
[03:56:30] oh my God 35 I need to do two more kill
[03:56:34] me
[03:56:38] pretty close
[03:56:43] just convert dude I'm not converting two
[03:56:47] to one
[03:56:47] [Music]
[03:56:52] savor it for me that's so much resin
[03:56:56] [Music]
[03:57:07] let me check something really fast shot
[03:57:42] savor it for me
[03:57:52] [Music]
[03:58:04] yeah the washer always gets buffed
[03:58:08] [Music]
[03:58:19] are you enjoying blade well okay yes but
[03:58:22] I don't really get to play him on the
[03:58:23] stream we're just automatic now but I'll
[03:58:24] get to play him in a minute I do really
[03:58:26] like him I think he's [ __ ] sick look
[03:58:28] at him look at him literally look at him
[03:58:29] observe okay that's not his old though
[03:58:31] but
[03:58:33] absorb him favorite in my place
[03:58:46] blade has a bit of attack scaling but he
[03:58:48] has more HP skillets
[03:58:52] like his killing will be like 90 of his
[03:58:54] HP like like let's say like 90 HBO
[03:58:56] they're like 20 or like 30 attack we can
[03:58:58] look right now
[03:59:00] he scales on both but primarily HP but
[03:59:03] also with characters with split scaling
[03:59:04] building crit is like usually the answer
[03:59:07] so just build crit but yeah HP is better
[03:59:09] see it's like 85 smash your speed 30 is
[03:59:11] attack
[03:59:14] and then you look and it's like well I
[03:59:16] mean we're on to be fair on like yeah
[03:59:18] like this is the base
[03:59:21] um
[03:59:28] is it gay to say Kaka no there is
[03:59:30] nothing listen
[03:59:32] listen Okay you can admire another man's
[03:59:36] Beauty there's nothing wrong with that
[03:59:38] in the straightest way possible
[03:59:41] [Music]
[03:59:42] okay I'm using a fuel
[03:59:47] we're gonna do we're gonna put silly
[03:59:48] here so what happens [ __ ] it
[04:00:00] [Music]
[04:00:12] so here comes attack boost is a waste on
[04:00:14] blade right okay stop saying it's a
[04:00:17] waste first of all yukon's main purpose
[04:00:20] is the [ __ ] crit boss that she gives
[04:00:21] you anyways even though the uptime is
[04:00:23] dog [ __ ] and you have to like speed tune
[04:00:24] for it it's mostly that but he has a
[04:00:27] split scaling so like attack isn't as
[04:00:29] good HP is way better but it's still
[04:00:30] something it's like Ting Yoon you're not
[04:00:32] using her just for the attack you're
[04:00:34] using for the [ __ ] energy and the
[04:00:35] damage but the attack's not like
[04:00:37] irrelevant it's just not as good so like
[04:00:41] in situations like that it's like let's
[04:00:43] leave an attack buffer right you you
[04:00:45] would rather use them in your other team
[04:00:46] but if you don't have if you're if
[04:00:48] they're available like team unit is so
[04:00:50] good
[04:00:51] same with like Asta as the speed off is
[04:00:53] really good and then it's like yeah her
[04:00:55] attack buff is like a bit wasted but
[04:00:56] it's not really wasted because it also
[04:00:58] Buffs to other members and it Buffs him
[04:00:59] a bit like it still Buffs him even if
[04:01:02] the percentage isn't as high
[04:01:04] and then on top of that it's like if you
[04:01:06] have her available you might as well use
[04:01:08] her like with Ting you and it's like
[04:01:09] this is a bad take no it's not look even
[04:01:11] okay let's say the attack is zero let's
[04:01:13] say the attack is zero she still gives
[04:01:15] you energy and is skill point efficient
[04:01:17] and worst case she can attack buff your
[04:01:19] [ __ ] silver wolf who cares like
[04:01:21] someone else and she gives you damage
[04:01:23] percent with her alt like it's not like
[04:01:25] you're not using her it's like you'd
[04:01:26] rather use her on the other team and
[04:01:28] then bronya
[04:01:30] okay
[04:01:33] it's fine this is like you don't want to
[04:01:36] use it there
[04:01:43] but yeah also to you and it will steal
[04:01:46] blades aggro which is
[04:01:50] [Music]
[04:01:58] received divinity
[04:02:14] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[04:02:17] yeah also though I will say nihility
[04:02:20] supports are really good with blade
[04:02:21] because a few reasons like there's like
[04:02:24] the surface level
[04:02:26] of like
[04:02:29] Perez tread is good for everyone but
[04:02:31] then on top of that there's not that
[04:02:32] many HP buffers damn it buff is really
[04:02:34] good but also Redstone is really good
[04:02:35] and defense is really good but then on
[04:02:37] top of that blade is like super skill
[04:02:39] point like relatively efficient you
[04:02:41] still are negative skill points but it's
[04:02:43] like still efficient
[04:02:44] so you end up having seal points so you
[04:02:46] can still more often on your [ __ ]
[04:02:47] noility characters
[04:02:49] because you have skill points and you
[04:02:51] kind of want to sub DPS on that team so
[04:02:52] like and well too like the three like
[04:02:55] sharpening yeah they're all pretty good
[04:02:57] well wealth is different because it's
[04:02:58] not as much like debuff but still like
[04:03:00] usually the healthy characters like
[04:03:02] silver wolf and Pila especially but also
[04:03:04] wealth are pretty good of them
[04:03:07] well it's alt is pretty POG but it's
[04:03:08] mostly like yeah action delay and stuff
[04:03:13] foreign
[04:03:38] [ __ ] I need nine of these
[04:03:43] [ __ ] all right we'll go to uh Material
[04:03:46] Exchange
[04:03:47] uh
[04:03:49] uh I have a lot of these I have a lot of
[04:03:51] uh yeah I have a lot of these
[04:03:55] yo no leaks
[04:03:59] there's no way so we're gonna convert
[04:04:01] these uh into uh
[04:04:04] um these ones
[04:04:21] am I gonna regret this
[04:04:26] task
[04:04:28] why are you dripped because blade came
[04:04:29] out we have to be drip for blade what if
[04:04:31] he wants to propose we gotta be ready
[04:04:33] same with kafko is here today too
[04:04:49] but how many do I need I'll just like
[04:04:51] [ __ ] it 11.

[04:04:58] bug and his weapon is 80. and it's crazy
[04:05:01] we need to do the weekly we'll do the
[04:05:04] weekly boss and then we can level some
[04:05:06] traces
[04:05:10] uh and his relics are work in progress
[04:05:12] we obviously want to get his set we
[04:05:14] don't have it yet so we're doing two
[04:05:15] piece two piece uh but we'll Auto Battle
[04:05:17] that later while I eat because I have
[04:05:19] food upstairs
[04:05:35] baldy all right
[04:05:37] uh we're gonna go do world seven because
[04:05:40] we didn't do world seven yet I also have
[04:05:42] to do forgotten Hall
[04:05:43] but I think we should start with world
[04:05:45] seven
[04:05:46] uh because it's new and new is good
[04:05:50] do you want to enter the Forgotten Hall
[04:06:07] wait what the [ __ ] am I doing why am I
[04:06:09] talking to erda
[04:06:12] world seven who's the Boss

[04:06:29] well silver wolf angle

[04:06:33] [ __ ] imaginary I guess
[04:06:35] all good
[04:06:37] uh there's definitely a Sealy boss
[04:06:45] but we're using playing we're not using
[04:06:47] silly
[04:06:48] we're using blade or yanching
[04:06:53] uh we'll do difficulty one the
[04:06:54] difficulty four
[04:06:56] we also wait should I do my weekly
[04:06:57] bosses first
[04:06:59] is she hard
[04:07:01] surely not right
[04:07:11] [Music]
[04:07:14] also let me reduce uh brania's speed or
[04:07:18] increase blades but blade speed will
[04:07:20] increase as we get better out of relics
[04:07:21] because like I can't control like
[04:07:24] we can't like look at this [ __ ] rope

[04:07:28] yeah like like ah we'll get better Visa
[04:07:31] soon
[04:07:33] I might as well plus 50 in this though
[04:07:35] oh we're gonna change sets later but
[04:07:36] might as well plus 15 it because this is
[04:07:38] gonna be good on that hung anyways
[04:07:42] oh we got speed wait is that enough
[04:07:49] two minus two
[04:07:51] uh minus two speed

[04:11:33] it's fine World we'll do the fourth
[04:11:35] difficulty after
[04:11:37] okay we need to get 10 blessings or more

[04:12:28] got this yesterday
[04:12:29] I look the same
[04:12:32] [ __ ] I believe
[04:12:34] by the way I was rolling a piece for the
[04:12:36] record for those of you who don't
[04:12:37] believe okay for those of you who don't
[04:12:39] believe in the artifact book or or in
[04:12:41] Rolling pieces that aren't perfect for
[04:12:43] any of you who don't believe that okay
[04:12:45] do keep in mind that this piece right
[04:12:48] here that I'm about to show you after I
[04:12:49] do this
[04:12:55] after I do this
[04:13:00] after I do this
[04:13:03] after I do this
[04:13:08] okay [ __ ] it I'm just gonna show it this
[04:13:10] piece right here had crit damage
[04:13:13] still rolled it only crit damage as the

[04:13:27] plus 15 because this is impressive what
[04:13:30] the [ __ ]
[04:13:33] I have never had a 40 credit average
[04:13:34] Feast it's a one in four I've done this
[04:13:36] like probably more than four times so in
[04:13:39] theory I should on average have one by
[04:13:40] now and this should be hard pity but I
[04:13:42] don't think it's gonna happen oh it'd be
[04:13:43] so [ __ ] sick if it happened though

[04:20:21] God I can never get over that Clash
[04:20:25] Royale laugh of luocha
[04:20:34] [Laughter]
[04:20:43] that actually sounds like that actually
[04:20:46] sounds like
[04:20:48] let's wait
[04:20:53] let me get a comment let me get a
[04:20:55] girlfriend
[04:21:06] age percentage is better than speed for
[04:21:07] blade it depends I'd say if you're not
[04:21:09] running bronya or like Asta or anything
[04:21:11] you probably want HP but I mean you
[04:21:13] probably want speed but if you're
[04:21:14] running them and have enough speed
[04:21:15] tuning especially for like late memory
[04:21:17] cow Sports then go HP
[04:21:21] I think if you're not running brania and
[04:21:23] you're not managing stuff like that like
[04:21:24] you don't have external sources of like
[04:21:26] turn or speed
[04:21:28] then I would go speed boots
[04:21:31] I think it's uh it's very hard to like
[04:21:34] it also depends on like substance and
[04:21:35] [ __ ] like you might have enough speed
[04:21:36] sub stats
[04:21:38] but usually you you would go speed if
[04:21:39] you don't have that
[04:21:43] why is speed important more turns
[04:21:52] wait I did one last time and I regretted
[04:21:55] it so we're gonna do enigmatic curio
[04:21:57] because I'm an enigmatic man yup true uh
[04:22:01] uh listen
[04:22:03] [ __ ] it
[04:22:12] thank you
[04:22:16] eject the borison or reject the Run
[04:22:31] trouble why is speed important someone
[04:22:33] replied it's an anime girl Pokemon game
[04:22:35] of course speed matters
[04:22:38] wait I didn't get 10 hunt blessings
[04:22:42] well I have 11. I have 11. oh no [ __ ]
[04:22:44] that doesn't count
[04:22:56] enough to show your courage let's wait
[04:22:59] let's see
[04:23:01] stay
[04:23:03] enemies
[04:23:04] no harm in trying
[04:23:08] well
[04:23:11] tragic
[04:23:14] that's what you get for choosing curio
[04:23:16] at the start yeah sure actually
[04:23:20] uh okay but the thing here's the thing
[04:23:23] right here's the thing
[04:23:27] I'm supposed to do challenges to give
[04:23:29] five codes per challenge but there's an
[04:23:31] alternative where if I clear simulated
[04:23:33] Universe with an astral Express member I
[04:23:36] can like and I stream for long enough
[04:23:38] that counts and I can give any code that
[04:23:39] I didn't get I still want to try to do
[04:23:42] the challenges though because it's more
[04:23:43] fun that way but as long as we clear
[04:23:45] with wealth then it counts and I can
[04:23:46] give the codes
[04:23:48] so yeah we're chilling either way
[04:23:58] yes the new relics that came out there's
[04:24:00] one that is like a support Set uh very
[04:24:04] good and the other one is vermilion but
[04:24:06] for blade I love Vermillion
[04:24:30] survive I want to see what um
[04:24:35] I want to see what a blade like an
[04:24:37] average how much you get from an average
[04:24:38] blade rotation do you usually get I'm
[04:24:40] pretty sure you usually get three Basics
[04:24:42] one alt one Talent right
[04:24:46] we got a [ __ ] energy here because
[04:24:48] it's simulated universe so I can't

[04:48:57] send
[04:49:10] wait there's more in the shop
[04:49:14] there's more
[04:49:18] there's not more
[04:49:20] there's not more
[04:49:25] it's fine we'll do a boss route
[04:49:28] okay first dude he's a kill actually no
[04:49:29] we don't we can just
[04:49:31] can we just finish world four you think
[04:49:33] I mean seven four probably right
[04:49:44] by the others okay but okay the others
[04:49:47] are so expensive though because it's two
[04:49:50] times because you have to double and you
[04:49:52] double it up and then you give it to the
[04:49:53] next person
[04:49:56] in the first row
[04:49:58] what are you talking about
[04:50:00] I'm not talking about these dudes I'm
[04:50:01] not talking about these
[04:50:03] I'm talking about the [ __ ] these ones
[04:50:07] bro has 4K oh yeah true we just spent
[04:50:10] okay I'm not used dude I was broke
[04:50:12] before though I'm not used to spending
[04:50:16] we do actually have a lot now that's
[04:50:17] true but it feels like a waste to buy
[04:50:20] these because they're not resin they're
[04:50:22] not stamina mats
[04:50:25] [Music]
[04:50:28] bro I can buy a third by the way
[04:50:48] we need one eight plus one so nine more
[04:50:51] nine
[04:50:54] times
[04:50:56] let's say 327 Blues
[04:51:01] I mean I have 35 of these I could just
[04:51:02] transfer it [ __ ] it
[04:51:06] wait no 27 times two I don't have enough
[04:51:08] but I might have enough dude I it's not
[04:51:10] worth it it's there's no way it's worth
[04:51:11] right
[04:51:13] it's 27 from this then I need 27 for
[04:51:15] another
[04:51:17] or like 26 times 2 from that one
[04:51:20] okay we'll do
[04:51:23] I have a lot of these
[04:51:24] [ __ ] it
[04:51:29] not worth it yeah but I'm impatient
[04:51:42] why is there no music playing
[04:51:50] well I made exactly enough
[04:51:52] take a chad
[04:51:55] all that for five great but it was worth
[04:51:58] it all right our plane's good well we
[04:52:00] still need relics but good enough
[04:52:03] uh I'll play music for now because
[04:52:05] nothing's playing in the background so
[04:52:09] okay um
[04:52:12] now we have too much crit rate towards
[04:52:13] crit like we need more crit damage
[04:52:16] but I don't know if
[04:52:20] we could do that yet
[04:52:22] because
[04:52:23] you know maybe we go sub stats
[04:52:36] let's just borrow this from yanching
[04:52:44] wait I don't think I even have good HP
[04:52:45] boots on any set I've got speed boots
[04:52:51] but I don't think we want speed boots
[04:53:08] massage
[04:53:13] I mean I guess we could
[04:53:15] wait what the [ __ ] wait
[04:53:20] the ratio is better but we lost a lot of
[04:53:22] HP how much HP did I have before
[04:53:26] probably six point something
[04:53:31] uh
[04:53:33] probably
[04:53:43] I mean it's probably good enough for now
[04:53:45] honestly
[04:53:51] you have cons no we don't have ones
[04:53:55] we'll get his if we'll get his good
[04:53:57] Relic set after then [ __ ] it whatever
[04:53:58] like I have the two-piece right now but
[04:54:01] like this is virtually no sub stats on
[04:54:03] it like it's one roll right and then
[04:54:05] this is like a good main stat and then
[04:54:07] six crit rate which isn't bad we might
[04:54:09] get more if we 12 it
[04:54:12] I might regret this I'm gonna 12 it
[04:54:16] just to see if we can get a crit rate
[04:54:18] roll please
[04:54:20] okay yeah yeah you know we'll get a
[04:54:23] better one we'll log in front we'll get
[04:54:25] a better one no big deal we'll get a
[04:54:26] better one for now we'll just play this
[04:54:29] build we have a good ratio our HP isn't
[04:54:31] as high as it should be we could easily
[04:54:33] get an extra 1000 HP or so no big deal
[04:54:35] no big deal we're on it's fine we'll
[04:54:38] just play this team uh and we'll have a
[04:54:40] good time our subwoof is on life support
[04:54:42] I didn't really notice this before
[04:54:44] um
[04:54:48] I would use this on her but it's not
[04:54:49] fully leveled do I have enough
[04:54:51] where I might oh but I just [ __ ]
[04:54:53] chucked all my yeah never mind I'll
[04:54:55] level it later but I'll just 80 this
[04:54:57] stuff from my tree wait what the [ __ ]
[04:54:59] where are my purple ones
[04:55:18] all right we should be chilling for now
[04:55:19] [ __ ] it
[04:55:30] oh wait this isn't even a blade world
[04:55:32] okay
[04:55:34] [ __ ]
[04:55:36] uh okay Chad here's the problem this is
[04:55:39] very clearly a Sealy or yanching floor
[04:55:43] this is not a blade floor
[04:55:52] um
[04:56:01] Mono Wind team okay name me a wind
[04:56:03] healer
[04:56:04] yeah silver wolf named me a wind healer
[04:56:06] matter of fact name me a fire healer or
[04:56:09] an eye sealer
[04:56:13] I can't I can't even play a [ __ ]
[04:56:16] silver team because there's no Healers
[04:56:19] Gene
[04:56:24] we could do blade for the elites and
[04:56:26] then switch to Sealy for the boss
[04:56:29] um or
[04:56:32] we could do [ __ ] we could just Gamba
[04:56:36] we can just pray that silver wolf hits
[04:56:38] wind it's a 50 50.
[04:56:42] and I'm just all I'm gonna say is hey
[04:56:45] hey our game might randomly crash if she

[05:09:17] anyways first one
[05:09:27] could be good so you want effect res
[05:09:31] um

[05:09:45] listen We're not gonna get an err rope
[05:09:48] okay that's not gonna happen err is not
[05:09:51] gonna happen so if okay
[05:09:53] what about the four stars
[05:09:58] this can be good for blade
[05:10:06] but you can also go flee to the Ageless
[05:10:08] for them
[05:10:12] click on the annoyances one
[05:10:15] we'll keep it
[05:10:25] we want that for I mean to be fair

[05:10:38] HP because who cares like she just wants
[05:10:39] to stay alive
[05:10:44] and then we could get an erro but we're
[05:10:46] never gonna get that I don't know why
[05:10:47] she's not on one but yeah
[05:10:51] so like for now we just swapped to this
[05:10:52] [ __ ] and eventually we get err and then
[05:10:54] boom crew damage
[05:10:56] wait no we don't want on
[05:11:00] well I should put this on my healer

[05:12:20] and we also don't need the attack from
[05:12:22] physical ages with blade
[05:12:24] wouldn't it be a lot smarter to give
[05:12:26] branya
[05:12:28] crit damage herself
[05:12:31] or you could give it all this that
[05:12:32] doesn't matter and then our healer gives
[05:12:35] crit damage to our other characters

[05:29:58] look at her dress look at her dress it
[05:30:00] has enhance
[05:30:04] look at this look at his suit
[05:30:09] I am looking
[05:30:12] sorry I had to I didn't even I didn't
[05:30:14] even think if that was a good purchase
[05:30:16] or not I I actually
[05:30:19] calm down I wanted the bypass anyways
[05:30:21] it's fine I just didn't have time to
[05:30:23] think I just
[05:30:31] well I've been live for five hours and
[05:30:33] 30 minutes whoa Jeepers man time really
[05:30:37] flies when you're having fun haha shoot
[05:30:51] one of the blade got in review it's
[05:30:53] recorded
[05:30:54] but I just didn't record the like how
[05:30:56] good is he part because I need to test
[05:30:57] them more and it's being edited right
[05:31:00] now so probably tomorrow but also I'm
[05:31:02] low-key waiting to see if any of the
[05:31:04] math changes because I like figured out
[05:31:06] what his rotation is but I don't know if
[05:31:07] that's like the like Optimal rotation
[05:31:09] like I don't know if
[05:31:10] somehow you do like an extra skill or
[05:31:12] something or basic attack or some [ __ ]
[05:31:14] so I'm trying to wait
[05:31:21] [ __ ] up the deer
[05:31:24] boom
[05:31:29] repay
[05:31:31] foreign
[05:31:39] or lose
[05:31:42] I have never fought this boss before
[05:31:43] outside of the memory of chaos well okay
[05:31:45] I guess I followed the memory of chaos
[05:31:46] but I found like a few times I don't
[05:31:48] really remember
[05:31:53] Q before Ultra more HP loss
[05:31:56] needs to be made for either honestly
[05:31:59] um that could be worth covering in the
[05:32:01] guide to be fair
[05:32:06] but there's a kissimming father because
[05:32:07] if you you first you get more
[05:32:10] mortgage with more damage like Ian then
[05:32:11] Q like you do both
[05:32:14] but your E's probably already active uh
[05:32:17] but if you alt first then you get more
[05:32:19] energy but also your all sets you to 50
[05:32:21] HP so you want to lose more HP and then
[05:32:24] alt usually
[05:32:25] so I think it's worth yeah I think it's
[05:32:26] worth doing EQ and then all thing
[05:32:28] because it sets you back to 50. but with
[05:32:30] luocha he doesn't let you go down so
[05:32:32] it's actually the opposite because
[05:32:33] usually you EQ that Alt
[05:32:36] really back up but if you have launcher
[05:32:39] and you EQ launches no don't perish and
[05:32:42] then he steps in and heals you look so
[05:32:44] that won't actually work here because
[05:32:45] look let's say approach it right then IQ
[05:32:48] then launcher says no no no no wait we
[05:32:50] heal because of this field okay never
[05:32:51] mind because of the all right maybe we
[05:32:53] already use the passive but usually
[05:32:57] for me
[05:33:07] is he generates no energy yeah but it's
[05:33:09] basically that does like you're queuing
[05:33:10] you're not just eating
[05:33:12] e doesn't take a turn he's like half a
[05:33:14] turn like you Ian it's still your turn
[05:33:16] I've got a way to get to let's finish
[05:33:18] this combat meets up this is double
[05:33:21] speed
[05:33:26] please wind wit wind or my game might
[05:33:28] crash
[05:33:33] oh there's gambas what the [ __ ] okay I
[05:33:35] did not set this up
[05:33:37] all right well
[05:33:42] I meant e that alt and Q
[05:33:45] what is it we're waiting for
[05:33:51] yeah that makes sense
[05:33:58] please throw
[05:34:01] [Music]
[05:34:04] I should probably cleanse bronya right
[05:34:07] yeah I read my skill point though but
[05:34:10] then bronya can't even use her [ __ ]
[05:34:13] [Music]
[05:34:15] man [ __ ] you bro
[05:34:18] oh she throws them all right wait RR
[05:34:21] don't die
[05:34:23] then I should save that for next phase
[05:34:24] what you can do oh good
[05:34:26] I definitely should have saved that for
[05:34:27] all last night
[05:34:33] regret
[05:34:35] I am regretting everything right now 90
[05:34:38] believe what the [ __ ] I guess is
[05:34:42] on me all the time
[05:34:45] Eternal sleep is that dead returns
[05:34:52] um don't mind if I
[05:34:56] mean his normal attack doesn't do much
[05:34:58] so we might as well just break a shield
[05:34:59] of a plant
[05:35:00] which one heals again I forget
[05:35:07] whatever I don't feel like thinking
[05:35:21] nothing major hey guys
[05:35:27] thank you
[05:35:31] can I have fun this time
[05:35:33] time for a bug Eternal sleep wait I
[05:35:36] should have implanted first but it's
[05:35:37] fine we're gonna imply wind not
[05:35:39] imaginary because we're not gonna
[05:35:41] implant the wrong element twice in a row
[05:35:42] that would never happen that would never
[05:35:44] happen we're gonna get thank you thank
[05:35:46] you thank you uh we do this
[05:35:50] this is double speed
[05:35:53] oh why is yours it's a tier three for 50
[05:35:55] months
[05:35:57] still waiting for the of Link oh that is
[05:36:01] awkward go back
[05:36:02] yeah it'll come soon don't worry wait
[05:36:05] he's one percent
[05:36:09] oh
[05:36:11] I didn't see his HP I didn't see it I
[05:36:13] didn't think I was [ __ ] him up that
[05:36:15] hard I didn't think I was [ __ ] them
[05:36:16] up that much I didn't check his HP yeah
[05:36:18] remembrance [ __ ] them up
[05:36:20] wait 592.
[05:36:23] all right
[05:36:26] those remembrance right remembers
[05:36:28] carried us
[05:36:33] all right this is 300 there don't pay
[05:36:35] for this
[05:36:36] lengthening your strength
[05:36:41] to Garden defense crush them
[05:36:46] your end approaches
[05:36:49] so hard to tell like I know the circle
[05:36:51] of who you're targeting is bigger but
[05:36:52] sometimes it's hard to tell
[05:37:01] more enemies time for a bug
[05:37:05] nice about wind
[05:37:17] that paradise may be savor it for me
[05:37:22] receive Divinity wait okay now
[05:37:30] that was easy
[05:37:32] Loki a waste of a Gamba but we did it
[05:37:34] that was [ __ ] easy let's do it again
[05:37:37] all right immersion reward boom
[05:37:41] that's good I win crit on the right side
[05:37:46] we take that next one never mind but
[05:37:48] this is good
[05:37:49] good evening that's good we actually
[05:37:51] want Chris damage more than crit rate
[05:37:52] because we have a lot of crit rate so
[05:37:53] good uh
[05:37:55] uh another one if I want a four star I
[05:37:57] guess that sucks that probably sucks
[05:38:01] I mean maybe if we use it on the ultra
[05:38:03] but yeah
[05:38:11] get on someone
[05:38:14] no
[05:38:15] wait actually
[05:38:19] yes
[05:38:21] [Music]
[05:38:26] that's not Blaze message thought set I
[05:38:28] know inner but it's it's just so sad
[05:38:30] dependent it's oh I got so many
[05:38:47] where are they
[05:38:50] okay let's check all the new ones we got
[05:38:52] but yeah in Earth sounds sort of was
[05:38:54] like
[05:38:55] again this is like old math because
[05:38:58] maybe things change now that he's out
[05:38:59] but inertia Soto was like marginally
[05:39:02] better but it's they're basically the
[05:39:04] same depends on sub stats basically like
[05:39:07] both are like very close
[05:39:09] but this may have changed but they
[05:39:12] should be like basically about as good
[05:39:13] and then Fleet of the Aegis is fine too
[05:39:15] all right what is this HP we don't want
[05:39:17] that that's good we don't want that we
[05:39:20] don't want that we don't want that we
[05:39:22] don't want that
[05:39:23] we don't want that we don't want that

[05:39:58] now I have a question
[05:40:00] I have a question

[05:40:18] a self-modulating resin
[05:40:21] and I can use it on anything I could

[05:40:31] I could make a a HP and I'm not gonna
[05:40:34] make HP robe I can make a a a a a a main
[05:40:38] stat that I want
[05:40:39] I could do anything
[05:40:49] use it to actually make your genuine
[05:40:51] good [ __ ] you
[05:40:53] paper p
[05:41:01] multiple athletes are asked who is the
[05:41:03] best football player of all time Spence
[05:41:05] all different types of players of
[05:41:07] genders and race for it all to condense
[05:41:10] into the Adidas logo
[05:41:12] it's a bit
[05:41:16] please fix your genuine It embarrasses
[05:41:18] me as a genuine Main
[05:41:20] dude your name is
[05:41:22] how are you not embarrassed also look
[05:41:25] okay he's not the best I get it but most
[05:41:29] of that comes from our lightning ball
[05:41:30] that I can't get better our [ __ ] uh
[05:41:33] robes on someone else our body sucks
[05:41:36] balls but I farmed I did from look at
[05:41:38] this ring it's good look at this hat
[05:41:40] it's good
[05:41:54] yeah he's kind of embarrassing but it's
[05:41:57] it's look at my blade though he's pretty
[05:41:58] good he has a bit low HP because we're
[05:41:59] on speed with somebody
[05:42:01] um
[05:42:03] yeah we're gonna get a set no worries
[05:42:04] what if I went into that now what if I
[05:42:06] didn't
[05:42:07] we'll do one run one run of his domain
[05:42:09] we're gonna get a good piece I promise
[05:42:10] or you might be back
[05:42:15] listen
[05:42:17] my gen is a work in progress I need the
[05:42:19] far more inert South Soto but I don't do
[05:42:22] simulated Universe off stream because
[05:42:23] I'd rather do it with you guys because
[05:42:24] it's entertaining but I didn't stream
[05:42:26] star rail for a bit so I ended up not
[05:42:28] getting more orbs and that's why
[05:42:31] wait what yeah that's the right one wait
[05:42:34] what is that this is a [ __ ] speed
[05:42:35] support [ __ ] right oh my oh my God
[05:42:44] this is so good
[05:42:47] dude thankfully that emblem of star rail
[05:42:50] is parrot like thankfully the Vermillion
[05:42:52] set is paired with emblem
[05:42:55] thankfully thankfully the [ __ ] the
[05:42:58] [ __ ] Blade Set
[05:43:00] is with a good one
[05:43:03] who's this best it's not on dude like
[05:43:04] most support characters it's not that
[05:43:07] good what do you mean it's not that good
[05:43:08] okay it's a speed for only one turn it's
[05:43:11] not that good but also you get six
[05:43:14] percent speed and a lot of support
[05:43:16] characters best set was four musketeer
[05:43:19] because it gives you some speed that's
[05:43:21] literally it
[05:43:27] so it's like yeah the two piece okay
[05:43:29] also the two piece is really good for a
[05:43:31] lot of people like basically any
[05:43:33] character in the game and then the four
[05:43:35] piece is nice for like
[05:43:36] yeah just give me speed
[05:43:39] wins that better yeah but the win sets
[05:43:41] two pieces wasted and it just advances
[05:43:43] your uh well okay no it doesn't advance
[05:43:45] I suppose but yeah it's only the two
[05:43:47] piece is useless and then this one gives
[05:43:48] you 600 speed and that it's probably
[05:43:52] I feel like this a lot of situations
[05:43:53] where it's just better but
[05:43:59] okay can we all about this without dying
[05:44:01] I actually don't trust this
[05:44:04] let's see
[05:44:07] foreign
[05:44:18] made speed tuning so much harder
[05:44:22] uh yeah I haven't played around with it
[05:44:23] enough I don't [ __ ] know I know like
[05:44:25] it's it's good on supports who don't
[05:44:27] have a better set but it's yeah
[05:44:35] to guard and defense crush them
[05:44:39] I failed to send
[05:44:43] you
[05:44:51] savor it for me
[05:44:55] received divinity
[05:45:02] six percent speed is like nothing
[05:45:05] bro what
[05:45:08] okay actually I'm not gonna pause it's
[05:45:09] all about link look at me look at me
[05:45:11] a speed sub stat is like two
[05:45:14] a speed subside is like plus two
[05:45:18] there are two pieces giving you six
[05:45:19] percent
[05:45:21] six percent
[05:45:23] you're getting two for some start
[05:45:29] and then you also have a four piece for
[05:45:31] some characters

[05:49:19] bird is waiting right now as blade
[05:49:21] hammers this monkey
[05:49:31] we saw like nine codes together I'll do
[05:49:34] that before ending I guess another
[05:49:35] little
[05:49:37] lend me your strength your end
[05:49:40] approaches
[05:49:43] is blading at all's five-star team no no
[05:49:45] you could use Pila and like Natasha's a
[05:49:47] fine healer though which is kind of
[05:49:48] broken but you don't need them
[05:49:52] you use like Asta like Brian is broken
[05:49:54] as well but you just use Asta or
[05:49:56] something well to yoon's attack buff is
[05:49:58] like not the best but it doesn't matter
[05:49:59] her alt is really good with them
[05:50:01] and she's skill point efficient and she
[05:50:03] gives him another hit of damage so like
[05:50:04] she's fine
[05:50:07] um
[05:50:08] yeah these suck okay
[05:50:13] okay yeah Brian does help a lot but
[05:50:16] she's on mood
[05:50:18] granted I've only played him with Brian
[05:50:20] today so
[05:50:22] I'm gonna have to play him a bit more
[05:50:23] without her
[05:50:41] savor it for me
[05:50:44] blue
[05:50:48] repay
[05:50:56] the dead returns

[05:51:11] I feel like ass is pretty good with them
[05:51:13] too though
[05:51:14] like approaches less damage rough though
[05:51:18] but we could probably do like
[05:51:20] just debuff the enemy a bunch and then
[05:51:22] ask the savor it for me
[05:51:32] fuzzy worker sales character though no
[05:51:34] like you can probably still clear with
[05:51:36] one but you don't want to show
[05:51:37] characters because he doesn't want to be
[05:51:39] low HP so there's no point in like
[05:51:41] making him low and chill again and then
[05:51:43] Shields make him do less damage because
[05:51:45] he does more damage the more he gets hit
[05:51:49] received
[05:52:00] savor it for me
[05:52:03] hog

[05:54:40] don't know why it was one shot silver
[05:54:42] wolf
[05:54:44] I guess that's how we died on auto once
[05:54:47] maybe I guess I don't know
[05:54:50] I mean yeah sure we're gonna at least
[05:54:52] use the two piece no matter what
[05:55:12] fuel time one more one more one more
[05:55:15] after this we'll go play blade somewhere
[05:55:16] else
[05:55:19] maybe okay I did some memory of the
[05:55:21] early memory chaos off stream just Auto
[05:55:23] battling and I wanted to do the late one
[05:55:25] with blade on stream but maybe I should
[05:55:26] do that off or maybe I'm sorry maybe I
[05:55:29] do that next stream I don't know because
[05:55:31] I've been streaming for so [ __ ] long
[05:55:37] no I'll probably do at least a bit
[05:55:41] it's just that I want to be able to like
[05:55:43] I want to like clear as many floors as I
[05:55:44] can but I know that if I go I'll only do
[05:55:47] like two because I I can't like there's
[05:55:48] no I don't have time to do all of them
[05:55:51] Daddy
[05:55:57] true
[05:55:58] Rush
[05:56:14] lengthen your strength do not pass
[05:56:17] faster than hung is I'm pretty sure he's
[05:56:19] destruction right
[05:56:22] is it not
[05:56:32] meanwhile Kodak and stuff for God knows
[05:56:34] how long oh I woke up kind of early and
[05:56:36] after this I'm gonna work on my blade
[05:56:38] video so I'm not actually sleeping so
[05:56:39] I'm also staying up but I should
[05:56:41] actually go work on that in a bit so
[05:56:44] fun fact
[05:56:59] crush them
[05:57:01] time
[05:57:04] this is double speed
[05:57:10] lend me your strength your end
[05:57:13] approaches
[05:57:16] you do it on stream no
[05:57:30] uh okay well we still don't have a good
[05:57:32] set
[05:57:33] but that's okay I could Auto Battle it
[05:57:38] um
[05:57:41] yeah blade is pretty sick I like him a
[05:57:44] lot I'm very happy with him
[05:57:45] but we still need the memory chaos to
[05:57:48] actually like you know
[05:57:50] okay I did memory of Chaos
[05:57:53] like I've already memory of chaos of
[05:57:54] them
[05:57:55] but
[05:57:56] I was like at the Hard floors and then
[05:57:59] he came out on the live server so I have
[05:58:00] to come alive sir because I got yeah so
[05:58:03] it is what it is but uh
[05:58:05] I will get to the late he felt okay
[05:58:09] I like how blade feels a lot he feels
[05:58:11] very Punk but um I do need to do a bit
[05:58:13] more at Mary Castleton
[05:58:16] um
[05:58:17] so okay
[05:58:21] here's what I know now
[05:58:25] here's what I know now if I speak as
[05:58:27] though everything that I know is true
[05:58:29] okay I'm gonna speak as though
[05:58:31] everything I know is true if everything
[05:58:34] I know is true this is his best icon but
[05:58:37] S5 secret battle is not far behind and
[05:58:38] even S1 is your best four star and
[05:58:40] usually your other best option but at S1
[05:58:42] it can be slightly worse than Clara's
[05:58:44] icon uh Loki depending on like
[05:58:48] like
[05:58:49] kind of well it's not not an uptime but
[05:58:51] like on the superposition level and the
[05:58:53] off time of the other light cone but
[05:58:54] this one can be about as good as S1 but
[05:58:56] then it falls off compared to the when
[05:58:58] this one has uh certain positions and
[05:59:01] then other than those weapons though if
[05:59:02] you don't have them just go the [ __ ]
[05:59:04] three star not this one uh Mutual demise
[05:59:06] because this gives you 24 crit rate for
[05:59:08] free
[05:59:12] and then this one at S5 with good uptime
[05:59:16] can be about as good as the three star
[05:59:18] but at that point why are you getting a
[05:59:20] five-star weapon and fully superimposing
[05:59:21] it even though it's free to play user
[05:59:23] heard a mods on something else
[05:59:25] um because it can sometimes still be
[05:59:27] worse than the three star it just like
[05:59:28] it's very close
[05:59:31] uh yeah
[05:59:33] but it has more base stats like more
[05:59:35] bass HP
[05:59:38] but I'm not 100 sure
[05:59:41] but yeah
[05:59:43] uh the this one
[05:59:46] like look at it dude it gives you attack
[05:59:48] on a character that wants HP and then it
[05:59:49] heals them that's it that's literally it
[05:59:51] it's just like it looks very sex I get
[05:59:54] it I [ __ ] love this icon but the
[05:59:56] effect is just bad for him unfortunately
[05:59:58] I don't know why but yeah
[06:00:01] woof walk time is literally zylock's IRL
[06:00:04] no it's not bro what okay
[06:00:13] this is me IRL actually wait
[06:00:17] this is me
[06:00:18] tag yourself I'm that hung
[06:00:24] um but yeah
[06:00:31] so that's what I think so far well I
[06:00:33] mean so I know that this is the best and
[06:00:35] I know that this is like the other go-to
[06:00:36] for most people that I know this is the
[06:00:39] rest but like I'm pretty sure if not you
[06:00:40] just got the three star but Clara's like
[06:00:42] one can be a bit better
[06:00:44] um and sometimes better than the four
[06:00:46] star S1
[06:00:53] how much HP on is ideal on blade stop
[06:00:56] okay this is a gen question I get asked
[06:00:59] every time how much attack should my
[06:01:01] show have how much age Feast should my
[06:01:03] hotel have how much [ __ ] defense for
[06:01:05] my Albedo [ __ ] stop that is a trap that
[06:01:08] is a trick question
[06:01:10] okay HP is really good okay but like
[06:01:12] just go mainstat HP and then crit is
[06:01:14] more important so look for crit but then
[06:01:16] more HP is good like there's never like
[06:01:18] a specific amount you need
[06:01:19] just
[06:01:21] level him level your traces get as much
[06:01:23] HP as you can but like crit is usually
[06:01:25] better
[06:01:26] so it's not like there's a specific
[06:01:28] amount you need
[06:01:38] nothing major savor it yeah your stats
[06:01:42] are crit then either speed or HP
[06:01:44] depending
[06:01:47] I usually recommend Blade with a
[06:01:51] someone like brania so at that point go
[06:01:53] HP boots uh and then wind and then HP
[06:02:03] lending your strength
[06:02:10] what do you mean usually he came out
[06:02:11] five hours ago okay but I've been
[06:02:13] thinking about him for more than five
[06:02:14] hours
[06:02:16] um
[06:02:17] that is a fair point though
[06:02:31] but you've been thinking about his
[06:02:33] builds
[06:02:35] inertia Soto versus the new one
[06:02:54] because we're gonna have to check I mean
[06:02:56] I have to make sure they're like
[06:02:59] see how many times we skill or normal
[06:03:01] attack per rotation officials three
[06:03:03] before a burst on the top like per
[06:03:05] person Talent
[06:03:22] oh yeah I could give the okay I'll give
[06:03:24] the rest of the codes while I Auto
[06:03:25] Battle this that's a good take
[06:03:28] good take
[06:03:39] we have like 10 more
[06:03:42] received divinity
[06:03:44] your end approaches
[06:03:50] like 10 more codes each code is 60 Jades
[06:03:53] that you can use once and then there's a
[06:03:54] code for everyone that's pinned
[06:03:57] because we did the stuff I had to do I
[06:03:59] will
[06:04:00] we're gonna
[06:04:02] give away thing and I'll just

[06:33:36] fine
[06:33:57] wait let's try it
[06:34:00] let's try it
[06:34:03] honestly every time we rolled a
[06:34:05] Vermilion flower that looked good it
[06:34:07] ended up bad so as long as that doesn't
[06:34:08] happen in this game too hahaha I'm not
[06:34:11] even gonna manifest it I'm just gonna
[06:34:12] shut up I'm just gonna shut up
[06:34:18] okay
[06:34:24] you better keep rolling crit
[06:34:27] you better keep rolling crit
[06:34:29] or I will find you
[06:34:40] or let's do
[06:34:48] foreign
[06:35:03] if this rolls hit rate again I will end
[06:35:07] my stream mid-sentence you think I'm
[06:35:09] joking I won't even give myself time to
[06:35:11] finish my Words
[06:35:15] if this rolls hit rate the Stream
[06:35:19] that's worse
[06:35:23] I mean we can use it for now it's fine
[06:35:25] for now it's fine for now it's fine for
[06:35:27] now
[06:35:28] it's fine for now
[06:35:30] it's fine it's fine
[06:35:33] where did it go
[06:35:34] it's like okay for now it's not it's not
[06:35:36] good but it's okay before and then level
[06:35:39] another five it will catch the game off
[06:35:41] guard trust me
[06:35:44] true Alfredo true
[06:35:48] um
[06:35:55] okay I really wanted to do some memory
[06:35:57] chaos today
[06:35:58] but I should probably work on my video
[06:36:01] instead and then do that next stream
[06:36:07] where's memory of Chaos
[06:36:14] um
[06:36:34] do you want to enter the
[06:36:38] yeah because I only all about I was
[06:36:40] gonna do all the rest on stream I only
[06:36:41] Auto battled one to three because I was
[06:36:43] like if I'm gonna do calf guy I might as
