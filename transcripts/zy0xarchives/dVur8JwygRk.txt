[00:14:56] 3 anyways our Lino guide is out
[00:14:59] um [ __ ] a day after everyone else but
[00:15:01] it is what it is I think I don't know I
[00:15:03] didn't [ __ ] but after the release o
[00:15:08] [Music]
[00:15:17] sethos okay but the thing is sometimes
[00:15:19] when my videos are like late like this
[00:15:20] wasn't actually late it was still the
[00:15:22] same day technically not really it's
[00:15:23] 3:00 a.m. but like when my guys are late
[00:15:25] sometimes it's because like sometimes I
[00:15:28] actually
[00:15:29] like I'm asleep at the wheel usually I'm
[00:15:31] grinding but like some but like this one
[00:15:32] I legit like was restless so like this
[00:15:36] was a fap this was as fast I could have
[00:15:39] done it unless I'm like dreaming before
[00:15:41] the character's out which in hindsight I
[00:15:43] probably should have but it's okay uh a
[00:15:46] few fuckups
[00:15:48] um okay well this one well okay there's
[00:15:51] no fuckups it's a good video it's like a
[00:15:52] perfect video but I'm saying like visual
[00:15:54] like that doesn't matter uh Bennett was
[00:15:56] on screen when I said sing Cho it
[00:15:58] doesn't actually matter
[00:15:59] like that should be sing Cho benett just
[00:16:02] [ __ ] appeared it's all good um that
[00:16:05] wasn't like that's not on me it happens
[00:16:06] all good is what it is uh and that's one
[00:16:09] two I repeated a sentence here
[00:16:12] um cuz I forgot the trim it doesn't
[00:16:14] matter strong and performed quite wait
[00:16:16] it was 1220 something wait I said uh
[00:16:19] which is still good but also monop pyro
[00:16:21] as well overload with shers or even some
[00:16:23] other teams that will cover vaporize
[00:16:25] monop pyro and overload as well as some
[00:16:27] others that I said mon pyro overload
[00:16:28] twice in a row it doesn't actually
[00:16:29] matter but like I would have trimmed
[00:16:30] that out but it it doesn't matter that's
[00:16:32] it it's
[00:16:33] 3546 I also included a white tassel R4
[00:16:36] clear cuz I don't have white tassel R5 I
[00:16:40] can't it is what it is glitter Nom
[00:16:43] true go to demote dude I don't even have
[00:16:48] R5 and it's not like I could just go get
[00:16:50] one
[00:16:52] oh where is it where is it I leveled it
[00:16:55] on yeah look R4
[00:17:01] so I don't know maybe we'll like in the
[00:17:02] new area or whatever pull for one you
[00:17:05] can't it's chest
[00:17:09] only yeah but I'm not going to go
[00:17:11] exploring for like 10 hours for a
[00:17:14] [ __ ] one clip in a
[00:17:16] showcase also it was kind of unfair cuz
[00:17:18] I have the good set on this account like
[00:17:20] look at my build look at my build team
[00:17:22] as well as some so like this evens out
[00:17:25] like my build was actually pep aw
[00:17:27] different so for most background footage
[00:17:28] I have my arino on okay let me skip to
[00:17:30] the
[00:17:35] here going like look at this
[00:17:39] PW PW well this kind of [ __ ] cuz us on
[00:17:42] her but
[00:17:43] the yeah although that kind of didn't do
[00:17:46] much for overload well Em's I mean the
[00:17:48] crit rate is nice but it is what it is
[00:17:50] um anyways
[00:18:04] [Music]
[00:18:10] well yeah it's my account but I have the
[00:18:12] new set
[00:18:14] basically it's just not live
[00:18:16] server but like everything else is the
[00:18:18] same as my account that's why my [ __ ]
[00:18:20] Chevy was C1 dude I wish I could try C6
[00:18:23] I don't [ __ ] have it anyways the
[00:18:25] video up yeah
[00:18:30] anyways
[00:18:32] um dude I almost started playing genin
[00:18:34] and didn't stall I forgot who I am I'm
[00:18:36] sorry also 5555 resin wow I mean uh not
[00:18:40] resin Mora that's
[00:18:42] cool is it worth farming heret if you
[00:18:44] have glad yes uh so if you're well okay
[00:18:49] yesn't so if you're like scar uh scar
[00:18:51] like if you're like okay maybe not it it
[00:18:53] depends who you are the thing with
[00:18:55] arlino is I assume if you're pulling for
[00:18:58] her it's cuz you love her and you want
[00:18:59] to make her your main and she skills
[00:19:00] really well with
[00:19:02] investment uh yeah it's around 10%
[00:19:04] better which is worth farming for if
[00:19:07] it's going to be your main
[00:19:08] DPS if you already have a really good
[00:19:11] glad and you don't you're just like okay
[00:19:12] I just want my arino to be good boom put
[00:19:14] her on glad you're chilling but like
[00:19:16] it's a noticeable upgrade to where it's
[00:19:18] worth farming for the new set if you
[00:19:20] like her like you don't want to play
[00:19:22] her uh and yeah this is very like okay I
[00:19:26] hate that you [ __ ] like I hate
[00:19:28] hate that like you guys are like susing
[00:19:31] cuz you probably looked at some [ __ ]
[00:19:32] that I can't look at okay but like every
[00:19:35] sign they've given us is pointing
[00:19:36] towards Bond of life being something
[00:19:38] they trying to [ __ ] shove down our
[00:19:40] throats cuz we got a weapon we got an
[00:19:41] artifact set we got AR Lino like it's
[00:19:44] likely that like future characters are
[00:19:45] going to make use of bond of life now
[00:19:47] you guys are timing Suk I don't know
[00:19:49] [ __ ] I'm just guessing but like not
[00:19:51] judging by your sus is probably true so
[00:19:54] I'm just saying like there's a good
[00:19:55] chance that this set becomes even more
[00:19:57] usable and I mean I think this is
[00:19:59] complete garbage but it I could be wrong
[00:20:02] I don't know still though remember usia
[00:20:05] Numa yeah but those are useless but they
[00:20:07] did Chuck them on every character that's
[00:20:08] true is that how you pronounce her name
[00:20:11] who
[00:20:15] arlino
[00:20:23] anyways Uncle Z caught dude I'm not an
[00:20:25] uncle I'm not an uncle I do have a my
[00:20:30] cousin has a daughter I gave her a
[00:20:33] little penguin that was her first
[00:20:35] stuffed animal was like this little
[00:20:36] stupid ass penguin but it was cute but
[00:20:39] that doesn't make me an uncle that's
[00:20:40] just like a a a step cousin not step
[00:20:43] distant I don't know cousin cousin I
[00:20:45] don't know and and it's just Uncle I
[00:20:47] mean I I don't know what the [ __ ] it's
[00:20:52] called
[00:20:54] hu Grand cousin second cousin maybe
[00:20:57] that's it whatever ever anyways uh

[00:43:35] one dude the difference between [ __ ]
[00:43:38] YouTube comments and like Instagram
[00:43:40] comments like I don't even need to pull

[00:43:44] comments are and none of them are
[00:43:46] commenting on oops I didn't mean to
[00:43:47] click on that none of them are typing
[00:43:49] [ __ ] like this
[00:43:52] normal also it's baiju's birthday uh I I
[00:43:56] actually I tweeted to baiju a happy
[00:43:58] birthday M well you don't tweet happy
[00:44:00] birthday to every character why'd you
[00:44:01] reply to baiju I
[00:44:03] said Happy Birthday live every day as if
[00:44:06] it were your
[00:44:09] last honestly it might be his last like
[00:44:12] I'm sorry like no disrespect by Drew but
[00:44:14] like I dude I do you not hear him
[00:44:16] coughing every time he [ __ ] dashes
[00:44:17] all good
[00:44:29] I saw some comments on my arlino guide
[00:44:31] saying her eye frames like when you
[00:44:33] press it is kind of [ __ ] and so I
[00:44:35] think this is more of a a more Universal
[00:44:37] experience than I thought like it's hard
[00:44:39] for me to tell when I'm playing a
[00:44:41] character if it's like skill issue or if
[00:44:43] it's like bad eye frames but I think
[00:44:45] sometimes Panic queuing like you just
[00:44:48] die so I guess it's not just me so
[00:44:54] yeah unlucky
[00:45:05] for
[00:45:08] [Music]
[00:45:26] [Music]
[00:45:38] okay anyways I'm actually just stalling
[00:45:40] now okay no stalling here's what we're
[00:45:42] going to do we're going to start with
[00:45:44] viewer PS to get out the way I think
[00:45:45] it's going to be fun but I don't want to
[00:45:46] stall it any longer the way I'm going to
[00:45:48] do this is there's a lot of viewer PS
[00:45:50] some of my mods went through oh yeah
[00:45:51] these accounts have like 5050 these guys
[00:45:53] whatever but okay I think it's because
[00:45:56] I'm un organized and it's day no no all
[00:45:59] these Pages this is for every form so
[00:46:00] look if I go to the first page and I
[00:46:01] click like here this is like this is
[00:46:04] like an account review honestly [ __ ] it
[00:46:05] they get an account review they're
[00:46:06] probably not even
[00:46:08] here um good ratio I mean a bit inflated
[00:46:11] by polar but still really good ratio uh
[00:46:13] we got uh okay 1010 uh you know decent
[00:46:17] pieces it's a really good stand amazing
[00:46:19] goblet uh yeah you know good child
[00:46:21] anyways
[00:46:22] um anyways uh yeah so let me go back
[00:46:25] who's taller
[00:46:27] Shia delete
[00:46:30] submission anyways uh so I figured
[00:46:33] instead of like dming everyone in
[00:46:34] advance what I'm going to do is if you
[00:46:35] submitted for viewer pull forms like
[00:46:38] you're on 50/50 and you have enough
[00:46:40] Primos to get
[00:46:43] arlino just let me know in chat like now
[00:46:46] and I'll do it so what I think we're
[00:46:48] going to do we have mari's account and
[00:46:49] then we'll take like I think we'll do
[00:46:51] like eight to 10 somewhere around there
[00:46:53] so just [ __ ] it if if you submitted a
[00:46:55] viewer pull forum
[00:46:57] and you're like like either going for
[00:46:59] more than one arino or you're on 50/50
[00:47:01] type me and then type whatever the [ __ ]
[00:47:03] your Discord name is so I could just

[02:01:16] than than winning another 5050
[02:01:22] so it can't be that hard screenshot
[02:01:28] that
[02:01:30] hamis true
[02:01:34] actually good roll all right all right
[02:01:37] well that was actually a good pull
[02:01:38] though like it wasn't a five star but it
[02:01:40] was a good
[02:01:41] pull Chi-Chi summoning triangle please
[02:01:45] please don't type that name in this chat
[02:01:47] she has ruined enough lives oh sacko
[02:01:56] I've gotten cursed of chii way too many
[02:01:58] times I can't even count anymore okay
[02:02:00] double
[02:02:01] lyette what the hell is
[02:02:06] happening unlucky okay if we're going to
[02:02:09] be unlucky at least I'll be educational
[02:02:12] uh is activating C6 bet at worth for
[02:02:14] most people 99% of players yeah it'll
[02:02:16] give you some power damage bonus if you
[02:02:17] have shenu and finina you can make a
[02:02:19] good team with like anyone uh and if
[02:02:21] you're playing someone like arino or
[02:02:22] you're trying to make a double swirl
[02:02:24] setup more consistent with someone like
[02:02:25] duuke it can help with that in mind if
[02:02:28] you're like a Ula Benet player for some
[02:02:30] reason or like a aaka Bennett player for
[02:02:32] some reason then no it can [ __ ] up like
[02:02:34] two to three teams but like generally
[02:02:37] like you shouldn't yeah I'm not I don't
[02:02:40] want to activate it cuz I don't know
[02:02:42] what if like it's just weird cuz like if
[02:02:44] if you can't reverse it but I doubt
[02:02:47] they'd release a future like physical
[02:02:49] character that wants Bennett and that's
[02:02:50] good but maybe
[02:02:52] so it's up to you at your own risk I'm
[02:02:55] C5 Bennett
[02:02:59] though the thing is like with kaching
[02:03:02] aggravates out now so you have a real
[02:03:03] team you don't need to do like some meme
[02:03:05] pyro like you're not going to play her
[02:03:07] with Bennett uh and then with YULA
[02:03:10] you're not going to play with Bennett
[02:03:11] unless you're doing some like screenshot
[02:03:12] number but even then if you are then
[02:03:14] like who cares if you're normals or pyro
[02:03:16] cuz your bur is still going to be like
[02:03:17] it's still going to get stacked although
[02:03:19] it'll be like worse if you're playing a
[02:03:20] benett Ula team which you can that's
[02:03:22] like the only one and then like aaka
[02:03:24] like who cares you're playing
[02:03:26] freeze but you don't need to like it
[02:03:28] depends on you anyways we're going to
[02:03:30] keep ring good
[02:03:32] luck I might make a video on it I was
[02:03:34] thinking about it
[02:03:37] oh yeah and a lot of new characters
[02:03:40] they're they add like this element like
[02:03:42] infusion can't be
[02:03:44] overridden but if it's physical then it
[02:03:46] would be different anyways good
[02:03:49] Lu please dude double double 50/50 win
[02:03:52] on one account that's like a blessing

[02:48:16] editors taking a break so I might
[02:48:19] I we'll see what I do with it but uh
[02:48:21] we're going to make uh
[02:48:22] like a bunch of like Primos on this did
[02:48:25] you hear the iname notice they're
[02:48:26] nerfing orino wait please tell me you're
[02:48:28] joking like the
[02:48:30] boss it's I mean I guess I don't care if
[02:48:32] it's the boss well I mean I kind of do
[02:48:34] but like I'm not going to be
[02:48:36] like wait let me see let me see wait
[02:48:38] where
[02:48:49] update
[02:48:53] summary no but they can't Nerf the boss
[02:48:55] in the same like in the same uh like um
[02:48:59] on the same day that it's released right
[02:49:01] I mean I guess they could but it's not
[02:49:02] like this would be a different thing
[02:49:03] wait what is it what is
[02:49:05] it can be marked
[02:49:08] puzzle am I getting one guide I'm
[02:49:10] getting one guide what are you talking
[02:49:13] about appreciate it Jerry good
[02:49:17] luck I'm getting one guy
[02:49:19] read known
[02:49:21] issues I'm not going to lie I don't even
[02:49:23] know where known issues
[02:49:30] is update summary known issues there's
[02:49:34] an issue where there's a small
[02:49:35] probability that aro's Mas the Red Death
[02:49:37] state will have an abnormal effect on a
[02:49:38] normal attack damage increase this issue
[02:49:40] will be fixed in a future
[02:49:44] update um
[02:49:48] I mean
[02:49:52] yeah it's impossible for me to notice if
[02:49:54] I ever hit that like if I ever got the
[02:49:56] bug or whatever unless I reset the same
[02:49:58] chamber 20 times and once it does more
[02:50:00] damage I don't think this matters it
[02:50:02] means Primo gems though right
[02:50:04] poog let just the bug
[02:50:07] fix no it doesn't matter
[02:50:24] yeah they should F fix your eye frames
[02:50:26] on burst I
[02:50:28] agree I absolutely
[02:50:33] agree I told you it wasn't a skill issue
[02:50:35] that I died on
[02:50:37] her okay I need to play double
[02:50:40] Geo not because I want to Lord knows I
[02:50:43] don't want to but because these enemies
[02:50:44] are annoying
[02:50:49] let me guess need
[02:50:53] something imagine after the fix she'll
[02:50:54] deal negative damage Pella why are you
[02:50:57] pilling that okay now that my guy's out
[02:51:00] and it's not day one and I don't have to
[02:51:02] [ __ ] be Mona laugh anymore okay okay
[02:51:06] okay uh 10 said he watches your guys he
[02:51:09] did not say that uh uh now that I don't
[02:51:12] have to be monk laugh anymore um um um
[02:51:15] um um can she we all agree she's pretty
[02:51:18] [ __ ] strong right AG GRE or am I am I
[02:51:20] cope like she's pretty [ __ ]
[02:51:21] strong so my my from what the from the
[02:51:25] Cs I've seen and that like alone plus
[02:51:28] talking to zag plus my own gameplay
[02:51:31] experience Fields crafter uh she seems
[02:51:35] like a pretty good DPS pretty high up
[02:51:37] not like net level not like broken but
[02:51:39] good um and like the like oaba Hut
[02:51:42] comparison would be like for Vape teams
[02:51:45] I think she's slightly worse although
[02:51:47] more front-loaded so like if you high
[02:51:48] invest you like oh my God she feels so
[02:51:50] much better so maybe but um for other
[02:51:52] teams she's like better like monop power
[02:51:56] overload stuff and then those teams are
[02:51:57] competitive to vape damage so
[02:52:00] yeah but it's easier to like one
[02:52:06] rotate but
[02:52:11] yeah but also I don't like just looking
[02:52:14] at like um it's hard to evaluate cuz
[02:52:17] it's hard to uh okay actually I think
[02:52:20] let me rephrase that the difference in
[02:52:23] DPS per rotation with like kazua and
[02:52:26] jangi is huge and I think with
[02:52:29] Kaza it's like if you look at the Cs
[02:52:31] with Kaza you'll be like okay this
[02:52:32] character's broken and if you look at
[02:52:33] the C jangi like okay she's good and
[02:52:36] it's like realistically a lot of times
[02:52:37] you're going to use wrongly and also her
[02:52:39] rotations are very um comfy like you
[02:52:42] don't need to like sweat a lot you just
[02:52:44] Mash your normal attack button um so
[02:52:46] it's hard to like give a
[02:52:49] intive which is why I usually abstain
[02:52:52] from doing so but she's good like that's
[02:52:53] all you need to know she's good enough
[02:52:55] to get if you want a DPS but not good
[02:52:56] enough to feel like you need to get if
[02:52:58] you already have DPS
[02:53:04] characters okay it's just one guy
[02:53:06] spamming T again you can't do this it's
[02:53:09] literally what like
[02:53:11] like okay you dude you need to reform I
[02:53:14] feel did I already time you out no it's
[02:53:15] a different guy okay 30 minute you need
[02:53:17] to reform
[02:53:26] something you wish to report okay I
[02:53:29] think if I go here they're going to dash
[02:53:30] to
[02:53:30] me
[02:53:33] f gu
[02:53:35] you next customer
[02:53:40] overed I really like something I didn't
[02:53:43] know at the start when I first started
[02:53:44] playing her that I really do appreciate
[02:53:46] is that um
[02:53:49] in AOE you don't have to [ __ ] wait 5
[02:53:51] Seconds which like doesn't matter for
[02:53:52] like Abyss cuz like it's not like you're
[02:53:54] losing DPS waiting cuz you can go on
[02:53:56] your supports but for like random [ __ ] I
[02:53:58] like being able to not have to
[02:54:08] wait if C1 is wrongly needed okay I talk
[02:54:11] about this in my guide I didn't I didn't
[02:54:12] condense my resin uh uh I think C1 the
[02:54:16] okay I think the resistance Interruption
[02:54:18] is
[02:54:19] like almost fake it's not like it's cool
[02:54:22] and like if you have sing trro it stacks
[02:54:24] and like it's comfy but like you might
[02:54:27] still [ __ ] die like if you're skill
[02:54:28] issuing at C 0 you're still going to
[02:54:30] skill issue at C1 to where you want to
[02:54:31] Shield cuz you still can't get healed
[02:54:33] it's not like another character where
[02:54:35] you're going to get healed with her
[02:54:36] you're not so it's like the it's nice if
[02:54:39] you're not running a shield but it
[02:54:41] doesn't save you like you're still going
[02:54:43] to it just doesn't interrupt your combo
[02:54:45] you're still probably going to need a
[02:54:46] shield if you need Shield without
[02:54:50] it but you can also like I don't know
[02:54:54] play you haven't played
[02:54:57] tat dude never type that again I I
[02:55:00] should ban you for
[02:55:02] that you said you're going to Conn resin
[02:55:04] yeah but I forgot so what about
[02:55:17] it what about it oh this oh wait chat
[02:55:21] dude last stream I rolled a really good
[02:55:22] feather well I got a really good feather
[02:55:24] but I didn't roll it and I remembered
[02:55:25] off stream but I didn't want to roll it
[02:55:26] off stream so we have to go roll that
[02:55:27] let me get some K resin first are cons
[02:55:29] worth pulling yes well it depends I'm
[02:55:32] I'm assuming you're asking that because
[02:55:33] you want to spend your Primo gems if you
[02:55:36] don't no but her C1 is insane and then
[02:55:37] her C2 is also good and her C3 is also
[02:55:39] good and her C6 is good but you should
[02:55:40] stop at C1 cuz C1 is the best oh
[02:55:45] Gage what's your opinion on D DPS bar
[02:55:48] DPS bar
[02:55:51] bro one
[02:55:56] second you should already know my
[02:55:58] opinion at this
[02:56:04] point uh I need to ascend my
[02:56:10] weapon tell P for weapon purely because
[02:56:12] jayp is so ugly on her dude they
[02:56:14] actually do it like they they do it on
[02:56:16] purpose and with arlino it's like the
[02:56:18] most Shameless like holy [ __ ] look at
[02:56:20] how cool the Scythe is and then like
[02:56:21] every other weapon
[02:56:24] yeah um black lift pole though looks
[02:56:27] like her like looks like a budget Scythe
[02:56:30] if you
[02:56:34] squint
[02:56:44] 10 okay I really need to get uh the rest
[02:56:48] to the mats let me do that quickly
[02:56:50] actually
[02:56:52] uh let me
[02:56:59] see in battle wait where is
[02:57:03] it commissions
[02:57:06] experience am I dumb oh it's an
[02:57:14] enemies oh cool
[02:57:21] is black Cliff good on her all right
[02:57:23] look here look
[02:57:26] here Zio are Lino guide whoa pogers you
[02:57:31] click
[02:57:32] it it if you want you skip to weapon
[02:57:35] section there's time stamps boom weapon
[02:57:38] rankings now you know uh shout out to
[02:57:40] Jeff for this however I will say uh the
[02:57:43] only thing I kind of
[02:57:45] wish no I don't wish I Chang because I
[02:57:48] made this decision consciously but if I
[02:57:50] could include a
[02:57:52] third um a third weapon ranking to not
[02:57:55] like destroy your [ __ ] like without
[02:57:57] it being visual dog [ __ ] cuz every time
[02:57:59] you put more than two it looks
[02:58:00] disgusting uh I would have put a team
[02:58:02] without with with Bennett but no um Vape
[02:58:07] so like a mono Power Team and in those
[02:58:09] teams white tassel looks better cuz here
[02:58:11] like white tassel's kind of Done Dirty
[02:58:13] because it's really good in this Vape
[02:58:14] team but it looks a bit worse than
[02:58:16] missive windspear whereas if you don't
[02:58:17] need the em then wi is a bit worse and
[02:58:19] then here it's [ __ ] 40% worse than
[02:58:21] signature it's like I think it's the
[02:58:23] biggest Gap because you don't have Ben
[02:58:26] it so the low base attack really gets
[02:58:27] [ __ ] uh yeah but like the left team is
[02:58:30] like the standard one I
[02:58:32] assume dud I have to wait like 10 hours
[02:58:35] for zff to wake up because he had three
[02:58:37] stacks caled on lithic but in this te
[02:58:39] you only have two
[02:58:43] anyways um yeah I mean black Li is fine
[02:58:46] it's as good as your free to play
[02:58:47] options it's like basically
[02:58:48] it's either better if you're stacking
[02:58:50] the passive or Worse well slightly worse
[02:58:54] if you don't get passive
[02:58:56] Stacks but it's better with like even
[02:58:58] one stack usually so it's not bad like
[02:59:01] it's about as
[02:59:07] good dud I want
[02:59:12] this okay
[02:59:22] uh mapel I think you run you run clam on
[02:59:24] on onfield
[02:59:26] Ki if you're talking about off
[02:59:28] field uh then I
[02:59:31] wouldn't but I would still
[02:59:34] go if you're playing off field though
[02:59:36] you're probably you're not I don't think
[02:59:37] you're going song of days past you're
[02:59:38] probably going [ __ ] uh I mean I guess
[02:59:40] you could like turbo stack your healing
[02:59:42] and it's viable so sure but you're
[02:59:44] probably going MTH cuz like not many
[02:59:46] people in your team can use milth
[02:59:49] or deepwood but you you probably can
[02:59:51] it's
[02:59:52] fine it's not that hard to
[02:59:58] stack acaron hotter than chiori om what
[03:00:02] does that have to do with anything what
[03:00:04] like like like like like like true but
[03:00:07] what does that have to do with literally
[03:00:13] anything how do I [ __ ] get up there
[03:00:16] oh my
[03:00:18] is it [ __ ]
[03:00:19] underwater wait no wait

[03:03:57] defensive utility but you're like a
[03:03:59] shield would be too much then you can
[03:04:01] use de if you're
[03:04:05] playing shev is overload and that team
[03:04:09] doesn't really have good defensive
[03:04:10] options outside of B and like Tom kind

[03:34:02] finina will like summon M and then she
[03:34:06] commits genocide which I don't condone
[03:34:08] by the way but uh uh yeah so that's like
[03:34:11] the only time but I I really I've only
[03:34:13] killed like seven
[03:34:20] 17 okay that's a bit more than
[03:34:23] seven I mean what's the difference

[03:35:55] only thing I didn't 100 till recently
[03:35:57] was Dragon SP was like
[03:36:01] 98 uh but now there's this stuff so I
[03:36:04] don't know if you I assume you there's a
[03:36:06] chance to get white tassel here right or
[03:36:08] is it fixed are those chests
[03:36:11] fixed I don't know I know there's one
[03:36:13] with a dark iron is there one with a
[03:36:15] white
[03:36:17] tassel M
[03:36:21] check there
[03:36:24] are there's white tassel a
[03:36:27] lot okay or is it a chance it's just any
[03:36:30] okay yeah that's what I
[03:36:35] figured it's not fixed yeah I didn't
[03:36:37] think it was fixed cuz I heard it was a
[03:36:39] like random when I actually I looked it
[03:36:41] up and it said random but like I
[03:36:42] remember dark iron great swword has like
[03:36:44] a fixed one so I guess there different
