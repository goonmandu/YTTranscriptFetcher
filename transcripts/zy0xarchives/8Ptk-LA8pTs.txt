[00:12:02] like oh like you know what team are you
[00:12:04] running like what you know is your build
[00:12:06] good uh how are you playing him and then
[00:12:08] he he's like he confessed to me that he
[00:12:10] was using his skill and then his burst
[00:12:12] dude let's now not everyone and Chad is
[00:12:14] not a hyphen player but all I'm gonna
[00:12:16] say is if you don't have mirrors on I'll
[00:12:19] hide them it's like playing it's like
[00:12:21] trying to brush your teeth without a
[00:12:23] toothbrush it's like trying to brush
[00:12:25] your teeth with no toothpaste have you
[00:12:26] guys ever done that you're like you know
[00:12:27] I'm too lazy to put toothpaste on my
[00:12:29] toothbrush and then you just brush your
[00:12:30] teeth with like the leftover toothpaste
[00:12:32] from last night and like water and it's
[00:12:34] kind of disgusting and then you brush
[00:12:36] and then it like makes a little thing
[00:12:37] but it's kind of disgusting and it
[00:12:38] doesn't really work that's kind of like
[00:12:40] playing I'll
[00:12:41] um but not bursting first
[00:12:45] has anyone done that
[00:12:47] have you ever done that
[00:12:50] you can speak

[00:13:27] welcome to the stream uh uh Cami pick
[00:13:29] welcome to the Stream
[00:13:32] how do you have so much resin oh dude
[00:13:34] crazy [ __ ] story so I okay crazy
[00:13:36] story actually I went to
[00:13:38] um I went to New York for the Fontan
[00:13:40] exhibit thing which we'll talk about
[00:13:41] later and do you know who I [ __ ] saw
[00:13:43] dude Jay-Z and he said his Ox thank you
[00:13:47] for 20 to 25 years ago putting me on the
[00:13:49] map uh and because of that okay well
[00:13:53] actually a funny story he used to be
[00:13:54] called just Jay uh but the reason he had
[00:13:56] a Zito's name was because of me uh I
[00:13:58] helped him like start his career so he
[00:14:00] added a z out of like respect initially
[00:14:02] he was gonna change it so just like
[00:14:03] Jay's out but I was like that's kind of
[00:14:05] weird so he just put a z there for me
[00:14:08] um and so he kind of we he met up with
[00:14:11] me recently and he was like dude I'm
[00:14:13] forever in your debt for believing in me
[00:14:15] when no one else did and so he gave me
[00:14:18] uh just a little bit of resin not that
[00:14:20] much what you actually saw him yeah he
[00:14:22] was gonna give me like he's literally
[00:14:24] gonna buy me like a house but I was like
[00:14:25] or like a car or something because
[00:14:26] usually you do that like you don't if
[00:14:28] you make it you're not gonna forget the
[00:14:29] people that supported you when you your
[00:14:31] day ones right like that's just weird so
[00:14:33] he was gonna like give back to me and I
[00:14:35] was like dude like to like I don't need
[00:14:37] it you know I already have too many cars
[00:14:39] anyways so I just like yo if anything
[00:14:41] just give me some resin and so we have
[00:14:43] uh six three five so oh you have a
[00:14:46] driver's license yeah yeah of course

[00:14:56] birthday I turned 23. second of all
[00:14:59] maybe it was like a family member it's
[00:15:00] like my lineage of boxes
[00:15:04] does this guy ever shut up
[00:15:06] yo why are you laughing
[00:15:09] no I wasn't I don't think Chad has ever
[00:15:12] said something funny
[00:15:18] I don't know I'm looking it's actually
[00:15:20] harder to look at chat here because like
[00:15:21] I have to like fully turn I've been
[00:15:22] following for two years I want my brain
[00:15:25] sales back match
[00:15:27] I did not hear that
[00:15:29] anyways wow I can't believe my streamer
[00:15:32] who said Fontan and the title is doing a
[00:15:34] Subaru commission wow
[00:15:39] wait chat when do we get Fontana you
[00:15:40] have to just do the Arkham cross right
[00:15:41] or is it a World Cup no so let's go to
[00:15:43] the archon right
[00:15:45] right
[00:15:52] you're not saying anything
[00:15:54] you're actually making like I feel like
[00:15:56] if I was a viewer I'd be concerned for
[00:15:57] you right now and I don't want to have
[00:15:59] like a I don't want to have people
[00:16:01] worried about you being like hey guys
[00:16:04] I've been watching socks and streams for
[00:16:06] a while and I don't really like like I
[00:16:09] feel like the dynamic here is kind of
[00:16:10] weird
[00:16:14] so Fang uh what is your favorite quality
[00:16:16] of mine
[00:16:20] was that I couldn't hear you can you
[00:16:22] please speak up
[00:16:26] what how funny my personality oh that's
[00:16:28] awesome oh no worries what else
[00:16:31] anything else you don't have to like no
[00:16:33] no pressure of course
[00:16:38] my charisma
[00:16:41] foreign
[00:17:18] which should be this week
[00:17:21] whoa is that really you who posted that
[00:17:24] amazing picture next to the Rune grader
[00:17:26] yes true you guys see this
[00:17:28] oh we didn't do the gentian though
[00:17:30] [Music]
[00:17:32] oh wait that's not
[00:17:36] yeah so I went to the Fountain exhibit
[00:17:38] in New York very cool I thought it was
[00:17:40] gonna do like a sponsored tweet or
[00:17:41] something but I ended up not so I just
[00:17:42] went for fun Vlog it was cool
[00:17:44] um so this is there's a rune grader
[00:17:47] there's a lot of like concept art of a
[00:17:48] lot of the enemies and stuff they're all
[00:17:50] really cool I took some pictures I could
[00:17:52] show but this was one I took with a ruin
[00:17:54] grader now the reason why it is
[00:17:55] captioned as such is because oh I'm on
[00:17:58] your account by that I'm gonna like this
[00:17:59] okay anyways uh so the reason why uh uh
[00:18:02] I took a picture here is because if you
[00:18:04] don't know the Vermillion Hereafter
[00:18:05] domain Charles best installed artifact
[00:18:06] set as well as the Echoes of of what the
[00:18:09] [ __ ] is Echoes called Echoes of nobility
[00:18:11] whatever Echoes uh has a rune grader so
[00:18:15] I have killed this guy 2 600 times so I
[00:18:17] wanted to pose next to him maybe do some
[00:18:19] favors that he gives me a good artifact
[00:18:20] so we did that uh and with that in mind
[00:18:22] other than that very fun
[00:18:26] I don't speak uh Spanish but this looks
[00:18:28] like it says uh follow or like subscribe
[00:18:31] so it's pretty cool no it's not as well
[00:18:33] can I wear the world I'm gonna close

[00:34:30] if they give her like a set that gives
[00:34:31] damage based on her ER or a weapon like
[00:34:35] something fishing related like I don't
[00:34:37] know like the bass or the cat or
[00:34:38] something that increases your burst
[00:34:40] damage and gives you ER that'd be pretty
[00:34:42] cool that'd be pretty cool and you could
[00:34:43] run with Bennett if it snapshots bang
[00:34:45] you remember it's not running his goal
[00:34:46] five seconds what it's not showing

[00:36:15] does it make sense that doesn't make
[00:36:17] sense
[00:36:20] now they're gonna they're gonna be like
[00:36:22] I was in Zach's stream and now I'm
[00:36:23] uncomfortable
[00:36:24] all right we're gonna do what I was
[00:36:26] gonna do at the start of stream which is
[00:36:28] my mouse is where's the mouse
[00:36:30] huh where's the mouse
[00:36:33] bro what it's right there oh it changed
[00:36:35] screens
[00:36:36] okay so we're gonna remove everyone from
[00:36:38] the party except who's
[00:36:40] ah Shaw's my favorite character evil
[00:36:42] shall be dispersed
[00:36:45] why would I gamble
[00:36:46] moana's Esther by the way oh okay I'm
[00:36:48] gonna keep that in mind when I put her
[00:36:49] in the deterior
[00:36:52] the remember chat it's not about being
[00:36:54] right it's about making people have a
[00:36:57] reaction more comments more engagement
[00:36:59] so we want to be wrong think of any two
[00:37:01] of this video you've seen have they ever
[00:37:02] been correct ever no no they haven't
[00:37:05] I've seen Xiao in like d tier and wander
[00:37:08] and S no okay no can you level 90 Ito
[00:37:12] it's been six years
[00:37:13] see this is why he's not 90. engagement
[00:37:15] that is one comment that wouldn't have
[00:37:17] been there so he's staying 89. matter of
[00:37:20] fact if I could unlevel him to 88 I
[00:37:22] would at least he's friendship 10 though
[00:37:26] okay anyways chat I have a question
[00:37:31] yes thanks so I we're gonna rate
[00:37:35] together as a team in unison we're gonna
[00:37:37] rate every character's RIS no we're not
[00:37:39] we're gonna rate every character's new
[00:37:40] party animation this thing right the
[00:37:42] only thing is I don't know if I'm gonna
[00:37:44] say the Cure I'm gonna say s a b c d e f
[00:37:48] g h i j k l m n o p and then I don't
[00:37:53] know if we should just leave it there
[00:37:54] and then if I put this on my second
[00:37:55] Channel editor just like puts a letter
[00:37:56] next to it or
[00:37:58] if we should place it in a tier list
[00:38:00] ourselves so we can look at it the only
[00:38:02] downside of that is we'd have to alt tab
[00:38:04] between every character but
[00:38:07] yeah what do you guys think
[00:38:11] Trey eat this mic no it's not my mic
[00:38:12] whoa

[00:38:17] yourself it's easier
[00:38:19] NBC ass music
[00:38:22] put it into this you can review and edit
[00:38:24] true
[00:38:27] all right w
[00:38:29] okay we'll do that then but then every
[00:38:30] time all tab they see it is there
[00:38:31] anything here that's a leak now right
[00:38:33] it's just the end stream

[00:40:14] and tier them I might as well have other
[00:40:16] opinions just to make sure I'm not an
[00:40:18] idiot with that in mind I'm still making
[00:40:20] the list so all of these opinions are
[00:40:22] still mine
[00:40:23] but maybe I'll have some people that
[00:40:25] guide me in the right direction
[00:40:27] because of that

[00:42:01] I have to wait for the alert to finish
[00:42:04] okay with that in mind what are we going
[00:42:06] to be doing today is ranking all the
[00:42:08] party joint animations these are brand
[00:42:09] new uh like this for example oh my God

[00:42:17] one thing came out on my stream I I
[00:42:19] looked at them I kind of talked about
[00:42:20] which ones I liked but now we're
[00:42:21] actually going to rank them and go
[00:42:22] through them all and I know like 18
[00:42:23] people have already done this but I
[00:42:25] technically did it first so I still have
[00:42:27] my copyright right what the [ __ ] am I
[00:42:29] saying we're gonna do it also you two
[00:42:31] need to speak louder because I speak

[00:43:25] you want to play with me
[00:43:29] that's the slice the Mage so Jeff used
[00:43:31] to call it sits in because I think
[00:43:32] that's what it says in Russian but Zev
[00:43:34] also pronounces Eula like oila so I
[00:43:35] don't know okay you can come like here
[00:43:39] then I can move this microphone a bit
[00:43:41] closer

[00:43:55] camera now
[00:43:57] oh no I'm fine chat
[00:43:59] I see you
[00:44:01] that assignment you've been
[00:44:02] procrastinating you should do it

[00:44:07] watching this on your phone
[00:44:09] Vine boom sound effect
[00:44:10] [Music]
[00:44:16] you want to do this start
[00:44:17] and then after this we have dental stuff
[00:44:19] to do so stay tuned okay the way I'm
[00:44:22] gonna proceed is can I do alphabetical
[00:44:25] no
[00:44:26] so in the tier list maker if we do make
[00:44:29] our own to your list
[00:44:31] yeah
[00:44:34] it shows all the characters in
[00:44:35] alphabetical no Sorrows before kokomi Oh
[00:44:37] but it's sanganomia but what the [ __ ] is
[00:44:39] ayler's full name Eloy
[00:44:41] but arataki okay it's not alphabetical
[00:44:43] is this release date but why is that
[00:44:44] Beto first dude what is happening with
[00:44:46] this order because Albedo's here
[00:44:48] satello's release date but then I
[00:44:49] thought it was alphabetical but then
[00:44:55] yeah but like then it's Halo it starts
[00:44:56] with a and she's before Tomos has the T
[00:44:58] and then Ito starts with a
[00:45:01] really wow
[00:45:05] random
[00:45:07] alphabetical and Regional yeah but like
[00:45:10] but like but like porque
[00:45:14] Porter release date
[00:45:16] so it does start with a don't quote me
[00:45:17] on that I'll hide them sniffer how about
[00:45:19] someone called oh items never sub for a
[00:45:21] year and I didn't notice
[00:45:23] subscribe for 13 months
[00:45:27] I wish genshin let you spectate other
[00:45:29] players when you die
[00:45:30] Mr songs one is the Yen FEI Costa you
[00:45:33] promised
[00:45:35] it's random you bottom
[00:45:38] all right so wait I need to title this
[00:45:41] so people don't think it's like an
[00:45:42] actual tier list how do I
[00:45:44] okay we're gonna first add a row above
[00:45:46] called
[00:45:47] SS go SS god tier it's just gonna be so
[00:46:00] okay we're gonna change the color we're
[00:46:02] gonna make it Pink
[00:46:03] boom
[00:46:05] I'm an D will just type Dory
[00:46:08] ready
[00:46:11] I'm ready all right let's go
[00:46:14] wait I kind of just want to say the
[00:46:15] ranking of each character because I
[00:46:16] don't have to all tab every time
[00:46:20] I'm doubting myself
[00:46:22] I think it's better if we just go
[00:46:24] through one moment because I don't have
[00:46:24] to all tab every time you know what man
[00:46:26] chat was wrong [ __ ] you chat your editor
[00:46:27] could do it for
[00:46:28] you yeah but yeah I don't pay them no I
[00:46:30] do pay them back I actually do pay them
[00:46:31] that's the joke I actually do that I
[00:46:33] actually do pillars that's actually I
[00:46:34] actually do pay I actually do fail okay
[00:46:36] let's go ready all right we're gonna
[00:46:38] start from
[00:46:40] um we'll start we'll filter it by
[00:46:42] quality
[00:46:43] oh that's faster on the four star should
[00:46:45] we do that
[00:46:47] we'll start with the
[00:46:49] [Music]
[00:46:52] chat what color are eyes
[00:46:58] I misclicked on that I didn't even mean
[00:47:00] to click gula
[00:47:04] okay let's uh
[00:47:07] where's Zula
[00:47:09] okay let's just put this right here
[00:47:14] anyways okay let's actually start uh
[00:47:16] we'll start with four stars and we'll
[00:47:18] move up to five stars in in
[00:47:20] chronological order as we say in French
[00:47:24] no croissant because croissant is
[00:47:26] smaller the biggest true all right oh is
[00:47:28] that why a croissant is shaped like that
[00:47:29] because in music theory course a
[00:47:31] crescendo is smaller to bigger and then
[00:47:34] a croissant starts small and then goes
[00:47:36] big and then it's a day Christian
[00:47:38] all right Noel
[00:47:40] I like it no that's like some that's
[00:47:43] like some no but it's so in character
[00:47:44] can I say this I'm gonna get unmonetized
[00:47:47] if I say this I feel like this is
[00:47:48] feeding a certain type of player that
[00:47:50] wants to play a mate outfit character
[00:47:52] who bows to them
[00:47:55] it isn't character I don't think it's
[00:47:56] bad I actually don't think it's bad I
[00:47:57] think this is fine this is okay it's
[00:47:59] okay it's not amazing
[00:48:03] yeah but you just like women okay what's
[00:48:06] wrong with that I like women oh well
[00:48:09] don't they know I do I do I do editor
[00:48:13] please don't put this in please I am
[00:48:15] begging you
[00:48:17] do you like women yes
[00:48:19] yes why are you asking me that chat
[00:48:21] smile if you love
[00:48:23] okay so Noel uh I think we can put her
[00:48:26] yeah
[00:48:27] it's okay it's okay it's not bad it's
[00:48:29] not like
[00:48:30] flabbergasting me
[00:48:32] put the definition on screen but
[00:48:34] everything's good I feel like
[00:48:36] I feel like her
[00:48:37] truth
[00:48:40] pretty good
[00:48:42] I just know that there's better ones
[00:48:43] that I've seen others but I think it's
[00:48:44] good
[00:48:45] um I just think it's a little too plain
[00:48:47] if you weren't here I'd put it C since
[00:48:49] you're here B
[00:48:51] damn I don't think it's a like it makes
[00:48:53] sense for Noel but not to spoil but like
[00:48:55] example the one we miss clicked on
[00:48:58] men hater whoa woman whoa dude look at
[00:49:03] this like excuse me excuse me so sorry
[00:49:06] get more start get better Noel raposo
[00:49:09] smoking on that Noel pack
[00:49:12] okay next up Layla
[00:49:14] oh my God she's waking up she's EP she's
[00:49:18] EP any EP eaters in the chat what is
[00:49:21] that sleepy it's like
[00:49:24] it makes sense for her she's like
[00:49:28] it's pretty cute it's not ass I actually
[00:49:30] have the prop yeah I actually okay
[00:49:33] ziox take bonus points any character
[00:49:35] whose animations bring out part of their
[00:49:37] kid for example spoiler alert [ __ ]
[00:49:39] you pulled up so I think that's a bonus
[00:49:42] so uh for Leila I think this is not bad
[00:49:44] I think it's like eight here
[00:49:45] can I all tab yeah all right
[00:49:49] because I don't like the ultimate case
[00:49:51] it like leaks like a notepad or
[00:49:52] something it doesn't matter but it's
[00:49:53] like I don't have anything
[00:49:55] easy You could argue s and I wouldn't
[00:49:57] even be against it but I'm just gonna
[00:49:59] put her a okay what do you think a s
[00:50:01] yeah I think
[00:50:03] this might be biased by the way I don't
[00:50:05] know yet we're just gonna we'll put you
[00:50:07] a little later we'll get to re-look at
[00:50:08] you anyways respectfully okay next up
[00:50:10] Cola
[00:50:15] I mean okay I like that she
[00:50:18] are the bubbles part of the map of the
[00:50:21] region or is it part of the no no
[00:50:24] um
[00:50:25] okay I like that whatever this is called
[00:50:27] Cole Amber I don't know what it's called
[00:50:28] the what the [ __ ] did I just say
[00:50:30] whatever this thing I like whatever this
[00:50:31] thing is I like that it pulled through
[00:50:32] but other than that it's kind of
[00:50:33] whatever she just catches it Coley is
[00:50:35] cute but I don't think it's like the
[00:50:37] best animation I think it's like a like
[00:50:39] a b it's like
[00:50:41] yeah worse than Layla's kind of on par
[00:50:44] with this
[00:50:53] I agree okay what you think Layla's work
[00:50:55] is not better
[00:50:56] she's so easy
[00:50:59] to beep that's a b someone just has to
[00:51:01] put all the girls in s tier
[00:51:04] I think it's better okay next up we have
[00:51:07] Amber
[00:51:11] with her
[00:51:14] it's it's it's it's okay it's it's like
[00:51:17] it's like four star yo me a four-star
[00:51:19] Lenny it is what it is
[00:51:21] am I talking differently than normal I
[00:51:24] don't know yeah I mean I think it's
[00:51:24] whatever like she's
[00:51:27] okay nah everybody should have pulled
[00:51:29] through I don't care oh whoa whoa oh my
[00:51:31] God oh my God
[00:51:33] yeah I think it's I I think it's I I
[00:51:34] think it's right Hammer's eye she's like
[00:51:36] uh see
[00:51:37] I'm sorry Amber means I'm sorry notice
[00:51:39] Nation wait what oh wait she pulls up
[00:51:43] the [ __ ] staff I like that there's a
[00:51:44] rock
[00:51:46] it's oh I think she could have done I
[00:51:49] bet she does have a hop I give extra
[00:51:51] points to every character that has a
[00:51:52] little turn
[00:51:54] like that they do a little turn I think
[00:51:57] it's good but I also think that people
[00:51:59] view tier lists as like a tier is good
[00:52:01] and everything else is bad I think it's
[00:52:03] good but like a b t are good that's not
[00:52:05] bad like I think C is fine C is average
[00:52:07] D is bad f is like what the [ __ ] am I
[00:52:10] looking at and then a like B is still
[00:52:13] pretty good I think it's B wait can you
[00:52:14] do
[00:52:15] we can't spend too much time on each
[00:52:16] character's like
[00:52:18] two years out of nowhere
[00:52:19] like it doesn't even
[00:52:22] yeah yeah
[00:52:25] yeah yeah and then it kind of like
[00:52:28] expands and Layla is a magical oh yeah
[00:52:30] is also magical actually he's a catalyst
[00:52:33] B I think
[00:52:36] I think I still think it's better than
[00:52:37] the what's the CTO Amber
[00:52:40] that was disrespectful wait where is she
[00:52:42] who am I looking who is it oh yeah
[00:52:44] okay easy B I think
[00:52:46] um we'll put a another tier add row
[00:52:49] below we'll call this F
[00:52:52] make it uh red
[00:52:55] wait what

[00:53:08] yeah that what what and then f is like a
[00:53:10] red
[00:53:12] and then s should be like
[00:53:16] ew dude what is this guy doing

[00:53:58] the chat for 10 off
[00:54:00] next up Candace
[00:54:05] okay you're biased because Candace is
[00:54:08] pretty no because she is pretty let's
[00:54:09] all acknowledge that moment of silence
[00:54:11] first of all the fierceness okay the way

[00:54:41] gonna look at me like that we're gonna
[00:54:43] put her in a for the reason that she
[00:54:45] mentioned
[00:54:48] are you kidding Dad she but no it's not
[00:54:52] it's not better than layla it's like if
[00:54:54] anything is on it's not better than this
[00:54:56] I feel like she's EP
[00:54:58] IC that's what I thought all right next
[00:55:00] up Dory
[00:55:03] move on okay I don't like Dory as a
[00:55:06] character but I do like the Gin I I like
[00:55:08] the Slime I think that's the only good
[00:55:09] part of her kid agree move on I like the
[00:55:12] Slime part go next I know you hate Dory
[00:55:14] I'm also Dory disliker but I think that
[00:55:16] the the the bloop is like not bad it's
[00:55:19] hot it's like a it's like a it's like
[00:55:23] I think objectively it's not worse than
[00:55:27] just
[00:55:29] I could do that I can be
[00:55:32] stop it
[00:55:33] all right razor

[00:55:47] like um
[00:55:50] yeah and like the effects don't last
[00:55:52] okay we're overrating everyone this is a
[00:55:55] c I don't think it's like you're
[00:55:56] overrating gory put it back to F listen
[00:55:58] I know you hate Dory and I do too but I
[00:56:01] think the Gin popping up is is not worse
[00:56:04] than it's not worse than
[00:56:07] 2.5
[00:56:09] where's Razer
[00:56:11] 's like C
[00:56:13] plus he's like a c plus he's a little
[00:56:15] better than Amber but he's worse than
[00:56:16] like I mean is he even worse than this I
[00:56:18] mean this is in character though Razer
[00:56:21] it's like the thing with my problem with
[00:56:22] Razer is like there was room for
[00:56:24] potential here they could just pulled up
[00:56:25] the wolf and it would have been s
[00:56:27] Sarah
[00:56:29] ooh
[00:56:32] yo no one look at my mouse cursor that
[00:56:34] was pretty good I like the fan
[00:56:36] what what are you doing
[00:56:39] I actually like that
[00:56:42] like that I should get a night tracker
[00:56:43] because that fan isn't like
[00:56:47] okay I was typing C or S what the hell I
[00:56:50] think it's that is not a mess no it's
[00:56:52] not it's beer a I think
[00:56:54] no because if you put Sarah on a then
[00:56:58] Candace is an s
[00:56:59] like
[00:57:01] bang you gotta let the past ones go who
[00:57:03] you actually do
[00:57:11] I mean I like the fan as I said I'm a
[00:57:13] sucker for parts of the kit that aren't
[00:57:15] usually shown as much getting shown in
[00:57:17] the party select
[00:57:19] oh
[00:57:21] if the wings
[00:57:22] it's like one frame look
[00:57:24] oh wait was that
[00:57:26] oh yeah yeah she had the wings of the
[00:57:28] ass okay I'm happy with a high B okay
[00:57:31] because I could see it being a a but I'm
[00:57:33] Barbie
[00:57:34] I like I'm a sucker for the electro fan
[00:57:36] Mika
[00:57:39] okay he had a book the book disappeared
[00:57:42] yeah Mika of the 9th of the funniest all
[00:57:45] right now I hate him because of you so
[00:57:47] okay I mean Mika looks like a like a
[00:57:50] twerp but I think I don't think it's bad
[00:57:52] it's like book in the crossbow it's not
[00:57:54] terrible you guys just hate Mika you're
[00:57:56] being biased I think it's C it's I we go
[00:58:00] next there's no D though
[00:58:02] oh
[00:58:04] Dory Trang Yoon popsicle oh he said wait
[00:58:09] is this very similar to this
[00:58:12] okay spoiler alert let's do Channel no
[00:58:13] no wait actually I don't because Chad is
[00:58:15] gonna go crazy okay I actually like this
[00:58:16] I actually like this bro four star is
[00:58:17] not bad
[00:58:18] I do think that us doing four stars
[00:58:20] first might like skew the list and then
[00:58:22] we see five stars and we literally come
[00:58:23] so maybe
[00:58:25] but I think this is pretty good right
[00:58:27] that was pretty sick it's like a like
[00:58:30] for a four star it's a like for what it
[00:58:32] is it's a
[00:58:34] Lynette
[00:58:37] because she's a magician get it magic
[00:58:39] trick hey tier
[00:58:46] I think I said it could be S I wish it
[00:58:48] had more effects what else is
[00:58:51] the little thing is nice but I wish it
[00:58:53] had more like sparkles
[00:58:55] I think it's a but if this is a then
[00:58:58] this is s okay dude no it has to be
[00:59:01] asked he literally does a magic trick
[00:59:04] and she flexes her cat ears
[00:59:07] me out right now chat five gifted Fang
[00:59:10] Nails I promise
[00:59:13] dear your pocketed cat that's deer no
[00:59:17] subject to change
[00:59:19] okay
[00:59:21] I think that's no
[00:59:23] okay we'll review the list later go whoa
[00:59:34] let the animation
[00:59:39] let the animation play then we discuss
[00:59:42] because if not then editor has to show
[00:59:44] this and then your take is instantly
[00:59:46] there
[00:59:47] foreign
[00:59:49] always true I listen to women and you in
[00:59:52] particular you're always right with that
[00:59:54] in mind uh
[00:59:57] what's up with this little buddy you're
[00:59:58] also a furry so biased no disrespect I'm
[01:00:01] just saying it's true uh
[01:00:04] I think it's pretty cool it's not
[01:00:06] amazing but he summons his little boy
[01:00:07] he's like yo
[01:00:10] you're fine it's cute it's cute I think
[01:00:12] it's B what do you think A or B it's an
[01:00:15] a give give me some reasoning I feel
[01:00:16] like I'm explaining and then you're just
[01:00:18] like
[01:00:19] I mean he just puts out the dog and then
[01:00:21] single animation like it was very simple
[01:00:23] he just puts out the dog
[01:00:26] I mean yeah that's because
[01:00:28] [Music]
[01:00:35] we can make a fence
[01:00:37] dude
[01:00:38] I am so smart if you disagree with me
[01:00:41] then after this video is up Twitch TV
[01:00:43] glitter Twitch TV not Yuli you can watch
[01:00:46] the video be like I disagree and then
[01:00:47] you make your own content
[01:00:49] you know what that is that's followers
[01:00:51] thanks for the following uh X loosas
[01:00:54] sauce
[01:00:57] here's some photos
[01:00:59] okay Diana
[01:01:03] I hate you no no that wasn't bad that's
[01:01:06] like bailoo you know how badly just like
[01:01:07] oh in in surreal that's like what she
[01:01:10] does she's like mixing it it makes sense
[01:01:12] she's a mixologist but it's not amazing
[01:01:15] I mean it's like it's like it's not very
[01:01:17] satisfying because her cup just
[01:01:19] disappears like yeah
[01:01:21] imagine those drinks
[01:01:23] I was expecting for it to explode true
[01:01:24] that would have been oh because of that
[01:01:26] because of what it could have been it's
[01:01:28] a c yeah
[01:01:29] things that we could be
[01:01:33] no
[01:01:35] more counting dollars will be
[01:01:41] wait do you think it's D chat do you
[01:01:42] guys think C or D I was thinking C but
[01:01:44] I'll get i'll get influence by chat here
[01:01:49] that's a good take that's a good take
[01:01:53] dude look at her it's like how could
[01:01:55] they have done better it's just good
[01:01:57] it's just good Candace could have been
[01:02:00] like
[01:02:01] yeah this could have been like I am
[01:02:02] Candace
[01:02:04] that was good Candace is good but it's
[01:02:06] not like
[01:02:07] nah you're copium I love Candace but I
[01:02:10] think Candace people are saying D for
[01:02:12] Diana I like that yeah all right
[01:02:15] whatever
[01:02:17] I saw you wait that's kind of cute I
[01:02:20] wish it was there for a little longer
[01:02:22] though yeah but it's pretty good it's
[01:02:24] like tiny you can't really see it ninja
[01:02:25] Lego Ninjago
[01:02:28] I like it hey tier I like hey here it's
[01:02:31] not like a oh my God
[01:02:34] I just submitted my last assignment for
[01:02:37] my summer quarter of college while
[01:02:39] watching your stream proof that you make
[01:02:42] people smart
[01:02:45] we don't know your grade yet but I hope
[01:02:48] you did well because that would be
[01:02:49] embarrassing if you didn't after saying
[01:02:50] that uh good luck uh I mean I believe in
[01:02:52] you congrats next up Syncro
[01:02:57] I feel like he did what exactly Mika did
[01:02:59] but more elegant
[01:03:01] not a crossbow this guy's like
[01:03:06] don't act out what he did it's not us
[01:03:09] like no but xinchill was an automatic
[01:03:11] buff
[01:03:12] okay no disclaimer new rule to the tier
[01:03:15] list we are not going to be biased by
[01:03:17] the characters this is just purely
[01:03:18] animation except for Xiao because I love
[01:03:20] shout okay no bias
[01:03:22] this I link objectively Lena is good she
[01:03:25] does a spin shows her cat ears you are
[01:03:28] biased because you like Candace you're
[01:03:29] fine because you like Linda I don't even
[01:03:31] like Linda that much she's okay I like
[01:03:33] like I don't dislike her but like
[01:03:34] I'm not the people that are like
[01:03:37] I've never said that if anything I
[01:03:39] literally usually this guy can testify
[01:03:41] because we play violin together if
[01:03:42] anything I type in match chat catboy's
[01:03:44] DM me I have never I have never said cat
[01:03:46] girls in my life
[01:03:48] true
[01:03:49] all right what's the difference well
[01:03:51] one's a catboy though there's that's a
[01:03:53] joke though don't actually it's a Valor
[01:03:55] joke
[01:03:56] I'll take Cactus is literally asked here
[01:03:59] okay I would if Candace told me to walk
[01:04:03] through a field of broken glass just to
[01:04:05] get her water I would but with that in
[01:04:07] mind I don't think pulling her Shield
[01:04:08] out is more than an a tier no actually I
[01:04:10] love Linda as a character but I don't
[01:04:12] think it's as tears magic trick shows
[01:04:14] her hat puts the Hat on shows that the
[01:04:16] magician-ness is in the hat that
[01:04:18] literally turned into her hat did a spin
[01:04:20] has a tail perfect elegancy in my
[01:04:23] opinion
[01:04:25] all right move on sync control let me
[01:04:27] read you a verse let me read you a
[01:04:29] [ __ ] seat here
[01:04:30] wait do you think it's higher I mean
[01:04:32] it's okay okay
[01:04:36] I'll hide them I mean
[01:04:39] that was pretty cool though wait
[01:04:41] Tommy pulls up a suitcase I like that
[01:04:44] yes
[01:04:46] okay editor can you like censor her when
[01:04:49] she dies
[01:04:51] it's a it's an eight here it's good
[01:04:55] it's a suitcase that floats and the
[01:04:58] suitcase illuminates the light I once
[01:05:00] opened I once opened your Twitter on
[01:05:02] your phone and saw Kevin's throbbing
[01:05:03] [ __ ] so because of that I'm going to
[01:05:06] take your ranking go it down one
[01:05:10] so it's an eightier a bit biased
[01:05:13] you've definitely seen it have you never
[01:05:16] seen okay
[01:05:18] let me I don't want that to be in the
[01:05:20] video Let's redo it it's coffee
[01:05:22] oh briefcase nice it like folds I think
[01:05:25] it's cool a tier as I said part of his
[01:05:27] kit shines I think it's pretty good hey
[01:05:29] here wait what do you think hey
[01:05:31] okay
[01:05:33] I would give it a beat to be honest but
[01:05:35] really
[01:05:38] I think for me a tier like maybe I'm
[01:05:40] rating things a bit high but the way I
[01:05:42] view age here is like this is kind of
[01:05:43] what I expect and a bit more it's like
[01:05:45] it pulls up the suitcase it's a nice
[01:05:47] thing a good design
[01:05:49] it's not
[01:05:51] yeah it's good it's not blowing me away
[01:05:53] but it's not like that's just good it's
[01:05:55] like better than just good it's like
[01:05:57] pretty cool
[01:05:59] I am a baby girl lover trapped in the
[01:06:01] room
[01:06:02] crossed in the room now with people who
[01:06:04] can't appreciate
[01:06:06] his Beauty now now where I no spoilers
[01:06:10] but where I know things are about to get
[01:06:12] good I love you
[01:06:15] oh yeah dude look at the money look at
[01:06:18] little buddy zoom into the money
[01:06:20] [Music]
[01:06:22] what more could you do with a character
[01:06:23] who summons a cute creature the best way
[01:06:26] to have a party animation is to summon
[01:06:28] that cute creature and I think this is
[01:06:29] cute
[01:06:31] yeah you guys are still in I think it's
[01:06:33] really cute a little bit of bias but I'm
[01:06:35] a you boy lover what do you think you
[01:06:37] Egg Way
[01:06:39] give it a
[01:06:40] yeah maybe it's a but I do like it
[01:06:45] like I can see why it's a because like
[01:06:48] this is also it and this is like kind of
[01:06:50] the same thing but I just love you guys
[01:06:52] see it though
[01:06:54] it's cute
[01:06:55] I'm sorry there might be I'll put it
[01:06:57] like a plus
[01:06:59] foreign
[01:07:06] all right next up Rosario
[01:07:10] doing it
[01:07:20] one six four three
[01:07:23] so I'm not allowed to do that but so
[01:07:25] Rosario doesn't even have a knife in her
[01:07:26] kit the fact that she pulled it up I
[01:07:28] think is cool but outside of that is
[01:07:29] kind of basic but I think the fact that
[01:07:31] she pulled up the knife and said I'm
[01:07:32] about to slice you up that makes me feel
[01:07:34] some type of way so I kind of want to
[01:07:36] rank it a bit high but it's objectively
[01:07:37] not that good or it's very short
[01:07:39] compared to like look at you anyways
[01:07:43] like a duration yeah it's like literally
[01:07:45] just so it's kind of but I do like the
[01:07:48] dagger I'm thinking like B I wish you
[01:07:50] twirled it a little yeah she could do
[01:07:52] like a like a valorant knife inspect
[01:07:58] I think it's B yeah
[01:08:01] a b c b I can't find
[01:08:05] no I think it's B I think it's B it's B
[01:08:07] by average yeah it's average
[01:08:09] Hazel
[01:08:15] [Music]
[01:08:30] super cup
[01:08:32] I hope they can see
[01:08:37] all right next up fire is on that was so
[01:08:39] that was actually a good thing how far
[01:08:40] is on
[01:08:43] here's the little thingy
[01:08:44] what was that
[01:08:47] C for C zero parmesan
[01:08:51] it's game gift have fun with this game
[01:08:56] um
[01:08:59] it's okay but like
[01:09:01] feels like be at the very least
[01:09:03] it's not I mean I don't think it's yeah
[01:09:06] it is animation is cool imagine carries
[01:09:08] the thing and also she has a ring around
[01:09:11] her yeah I think it'd be BRC but it's
[01:09:13] probably it's better than the Seas not
[01:09:15] true true I think yeah yeah true it's
[01:09:18] better than Rosario's
[01:09:26] now and she's gonna Scream s so be ready
[01:09:29] for that actually close your eyes let's
[01:09:31] let's let us handle this one
[01:09:35] dude
[01:09:36] okay
[01:09:39] it probably has more yeah
[01:09:42] it is such a it's such a gorgeous I
[01:09:45] actually sense the culture there right
[01:09:48] I feel cultured watching that hey dear I
[01:09:51] just gained culture I am now a cultured
[01:09:53] man I saw it hey dear okay I just gained
[01:09:57] culture no it's ass let's make a deer
[01:09:59] called culture
[01:10:01] adrow above
[01:10:03] culture tier
[01:10:05] I can't spell
[01:10:11] where is she
[01:10:12] culture
[01:10:15] I think I think it's a I think it's a
[01:10:19] wheelchair okay but I'm not this looks
[01:10:20] weird if people look at it how
[01:10:24] no but because like she's gonna be the
[01:10:26] only one there is anyone else
[01:10:31] no okay but no one else has like who
[01:10:34] else has cultural I mean there probably
[01:10:35] are some and now I'm gonna get canceled
[01:10:37] if I say that sure what is my cycle for
[01:10:40] Idol yeah they did oh it's recycling
[01:10:42] okay hey let's just do eight let's just
[01:10:44] do it
[01:10:45] so recycling would be a b cultural
[01:10:48] significance is an S average a true can
[01:10:51] I get a true LOL W in the chat
[01:10:53] it's just a reused idle oh that is a bit
[01:10:55] lower then
[01:10:58] okay because it's a reason idle I can't
[01:11:00] put a b but if I put it B I am literally
[01:11:03] I will not have a ride home so we're
[01:11:05] gonna just put it a
[01:11:09] heart
[01:11:13] all right ning Wong
[01:11:17] wait is that a new skin oh yeah I bought
[01:11:20] it actually it was free in an event but
[01:11:21] I forgot to do the event
[01:11:24] oh you bought it yeah don't say that
[01:11:26] publicly I got it for free sorry yeah
[01:11:29] I actually like the way she like I think
[01:11:31] this is a simple one that works because
[01:11:32] it's elegant
[01:11:34] I love the way the gems follow her hand
[01:11:40] s yeah it's a symbol
[01:11:42] right wait that's good is really nice
[01:11:44] actually yeah this one's really good
[01:11:47] s I think it's good ARS I think it's
[01:11:50] like bra no
[01:11:52] I don't do this I think I think ning
[01:11:54] Wong's skin
[01:11:55] I think ning Wong's skin makes anything
[01:11:58] she does s tier like even if she just if
[01:12:00] this was her Idol I'd be like s because
[01:12:01] it's nothing wrong but I think the
[01:12:03] animation is like a b average out the a
[01:12:04] true no but then that that's not what I
[01:12:07] said in my tier list the animation is a
[01:12:08] so it's a true
[01:12:10] I love you Google
[01:12:12] he breathed fire at the end he breathed
[01:12:14] look let's play back instant replay

[01:13:28] welcome to my house play the music too
[01:13:33] loud
[01:13:37] Barbara
[01:13:39] before we do Barbara listen
[01:13:46] pretty good
[01:13:49] I like it she just jumped in with a
[01:13:52] little
[01:13:54] what Barbara's eyes she's like
[01:13:57] animation in the back
[01:13:59] why are you looking at her feet
[01:14:01] she's like six
[01:14:04] no she's not but she's oh
[01:14:07] I even notice that
[01:14:08] I like ducky
[01:14:23] yeah go ahead go ahead okay go ahead
[01:14:33] it's not even it's like dude's good Loki
[01:14:37] it's almost like dids here
[01:14:40] bad
[01:14:41] look you don't do anything
[01:14:46] oh my God
[01:14:49] I
[01:14:50] buy resign it's like a is this BRC I
[01:14:54] can't even make decisions
[01:14:55] I need like a reset of what I think is
[01:14:58] good
[01:14:59] it's short but yeah stars in the
[01:15:02] background yeah it's a beef
[01:15:04] okay fine
[01:15:07] I don't want to go home no
[01:15:10] all right Chihuahua oh if she's a cat
[01:15:12] parcel I kind of forget because I did so
[01:15:13] I'll go if she's a cat box this is gonna
[01:15:15] be a high oh oh yeah it's a cosplayer
[01:15:18] pose it's fine
[01:15:21] this is what okay this is my opinion a
[01:15:23] Kirara cosplayer would do this actual
[01:15:25] Kirara from the actual video game should
[01:15:28] turn into a box
[01:15:30] that's my take like if I'm a QR
[01:15:32] cosplayer I do this if I'm curara if I
[01:15:35] actually know if I'm actually Kirara and
[01:15:37] I'm posing I'm gonna turn into the box
[01:15:39] no please no
[01:15:44] oh I should wink right
[01:15:46] okay all right yeah I mean it's it's
[01:15:48] whatever it's like see it it's not bad
[01:15:50] but it has a lot of more potential I
[01:15:52] could add
[01:15:55] C for cat true
[01:15:59] I mean
[01:16:00] okay they were very kind to make it
[01:16:03] realistic for cosplayers you know like
[01:16:06] this is such a nice cure our pose you
[01:16:08] know like people in real life Who
[01:16:10] cosplay care can actually imitate that
[01:16:12] post very perfectly so I think I think
[01:16:15] the game was very considerate about that
[01:16:17] which means you know the animation's
[01:16:18] really good wait yeah actually think
[01:16:20] about that stuff no see here
[01:16:23] uh where's Kirara
[01:16:26] see
[01:16:29] all right next up Lisa
[01:16:33] I like the rose I remember when she
[01:16:35] floats that's pretty cool that's pretty
[01:16:36] cool for like I think there's like a
[01:16:37] four star thing but for a Forester is
[01:16:39] pretty good like she kind of floats has
[01:16:41] a rose
[01:16:42] looks at it looks at you like damn okay
[01:16:46] that's a at least a at least a I agree
[01:16:48] okay
[01:16:51] it's just the mommies the EP girls
[01:16:54] that you guys love okay
[01:16:58] Kirara literally just
[01:17:01] yo Tomo literally I could do this
[01:17:08] uh at least minimum age minimum maybe s
[01:17:13] hey Xiao
[01:17:15] Lisa at least an a I'm gonna put her a
[01:17:17] because it could be S uh maybe not but
[01:17:19] hi
[01:17:23] who's next Bennett Rock Falls hits him
[01:17:26] in character but kind of cringe
[01:17:28] default yeah it's just an idol it's just
[01:17:30] an idol one of his idols like
[01:17:35] yeah it's one of his reused Idols it's
[01:17:37] in character but like
[01:17:40] that's really I love you Bennett but
[01:17:42] like that's a that's a d no D for did it
[01:17:46] yeah
[01:17:48] you think B why wait it's a reused Idol
[01:17:51] like okay when I'm recording sometimes I
[01:17:53] just hear Bennett doing like look listen
[01:17:54] watch
[01:17:55] it's literally about to happen I
[01:17:57] guarantee it look
[01:17:59] [ __ ] it's a 50 50. we lost it but look
[01:18:01] it's about to happen look
[01:18:15] look
[01:18:20] see it's literally it's like it's not
[01:18:23] bad but it's just a reused Idol
[01:18:27] right it's recycled yeah it's recycled
[01:18:30] that's like a d I'm sorry
[01:18:32] wait that's just
[01:18:34] that is
[01:18:38] people too no no isn't that like her alt
[01:18:40] wait I haven't played Shannon so long
[01:18:41] I'm sorry let me show you
[01:18:46] [Music]
[01:18:48] let me go get some particles
[01:18:55] Benny's but
[01:18:57] they are all recycled no they're not
[01:19:00] no no they're not not recycled they're
[01:19:02] not they're not
[01:19:06] oh
[01:19:07] wait I didn't even get enough energy
[01:19:14] that is because it's best thought to not
[01:19:16] give your shinyan
[01:19:19] tell me why Shin yet all right press e
[01:19:26] similar someone shot this was the skill
[01:19:28] the end of the skill animation it's
[01:19:31] similar
[01:19:34] then hung trailer we'll watch Raptor
[01:19:36] it's not that wasn't exactly the same
[01:19:39] somewhat similar
[01:19:40] wait shinyan main 11 is in the chat all
[01:19:43] right shinyan Maine what do you think
[01:19:44] what do you think it is I think it's
[01:19:45] like up it's I it's not S I think it's
[01:19:48] not
[01:19:49] bang you can listen this is good a good
[01:19:52] opportunity for you to make your own
[01:19:53] tier list but with that said that is
[01:19:55] definitely a bad thing
[01:19:56] wait I want to switch to Xiao but I
[01:19:57] don't want to see it I mean I've already
[01:19:58] seen it it's fine conquering demons is
[01:20:01] what I do
[01:20:02] okay
[01:20:05] salty that she does that pose better
[01:20:07] than you do what
[01:20:10] um
[01:20:11] okay we're spending too much time on the
[01:20:12] characters I want this to be like a six
[01:20:13] year video so
[01:20:15] it's okay it's just like a power cord
[01:20:17] it's all right it's like beer
[01:20:19] it's not us
[01:20:23] it's okay
[01:20:26] okay
[01:20:27] at the least
[01:20:32] they shouldn't take Luna out I don't
[01:20:34] know if this is biased but somehow I
[01:20:35] prefer ning Wong's rocks over this too
[01:20:38] yeah I wonder why no it's not bad
[01:20:49] saying your ratings are very telling
[01:20:52] that is all that is all that is all
[01:20:54] that's all that's all what does that
[01:20:55] even mean
[01:21:02] there's no way okay
[01:21:06] understand you thank you thank you I'm
[01:21:08] trapped in a room
[01:21:15] dude I'm sorry Beto
[01:21:20] like look no bias Beto insanely I'm I
[01:21:23] love Beto I'm a bad old lover but this
[01:21:25] is just whatever like she just turns
[01:21:27] around true
[01:21:32] um like I love Beto trust me but this is
[01:21:36] also just whatever like I'm not being
[01:21:37] biased here
[01:21:40] this oh no I'm not gonna die I'm I'm
[01:21:43] going to die on the hill that singing is
[01:21:45] at least an eight I put an a no no yeah
[01:21:47] it is I did
[01:21:49] it
[01:21:55] f
[01:21:58] I love Beto like I genuinely love Beto
[01:22:00] and I don't see the appeal here she just
[01:22:02] turned around I mean I've heard it
[01:22:04] someone say that it kind of comes
[01:22:05] similar to ning Wong but the other way
[01:22:07] so there's like something happening here
[01:22:08] which I like but other than that it's
[01:22:10] just like but at least you all had a
[01:22:11] little gem thing I wish I had like a you
[01:22:13] know those like wine clay pots that she
[01:22:15] usually drinks out of I wish it was
[01:22:17] holding one of them yeah it's it's
[01:22:19] whatever it's like a Sierra D honestly
[01:22:24] and it's like a b no I love I'm telling
[01:22:27] you I love Beto but like I don't think
[01:22:29] this is good
[01:22:31] like Beto can even use their birthday
[01:22:33] like lightning yeah it's recycled but
[01:22:35] it's better than just
[01:22:36] official
[01:22:45] it's an iconic pose but there's no Oz
[01:22:47] where's Oz yeah
[01:22:49] where's Oz what is he doing
[01:22:53] it's still a cool pose
[01:22:57] uh everyone's saying a all of Chad is
[01:22:59] saying hey
[01:23:01] I think it's B because there's no others
[01:23:03] I think it's B I think it's B I'm sorry
[01:23:05] again I really like Fishel one of my
[01:23:06] favorite characters but I think it's
[01:23:08] just a like all it should be there
[01:23:10] there's no reason for us not to be there
[01:23:15] listen you can make your own where is
[01:23:19] the team effort I actually agree with a
[01:23:20] lot of that's me yeah I agree because it
[01:23:23] could be better
[01:23:24] okay that is sick [ __ ] whip Ivy from
[01:23:28] Soul Calibur watch they're gonna say us
[01:23:30] or a this is cool you think this is
[01:23:32] right watch just watch look at the
[01:23:35] animation though it's literally cool
[01:23:36] it's I think it's like a recycled skill
[01:23:38] animation but I still think it looks
[01:23:39] cool
[01:23:40] because it's kind of recycled
[01:23:45] well he's today
[01:23:46] it could be B because it is recycled oh
[01:23:49] is it okay
[01:23:52] but I think it's better than like
[01:23:58] okay no this is awesome I think these
[01:24:01] are the same I think these are the same
[01:24:02] this is a recycled kind of recycled but
[01:24:04] pretty cool
[01:24:12] no there's no way
[01:24:14] there's no way that's better
[01:24:16] yeah I don't think it's better I don't
[01:24:18] think it's better I actually don't think
[01:24:19] it's better than officials
[01:24:21] cookies
[01:24:23] see now that's all that needs to be in
[01:24:25] the video
[01:24:27] it's fine it's like a b ite
[01:24:30] I don't feel too strongly about it it's
[01:24:31] kind of it's kind of recycled animation
[01:24:33] but it's not a bad one what
[01:24:38] also a kind of recycled animation a
[01:24:41] little bit different but not a bad one
[01:24:42] all so a b consistent ranking Kaya cool
[01:24:45] it balls s
[01:24:47] well no I mean I mean if there's a coin
[01:24:49] then looks at you seductively
[01:24:53] but be for false
[01:24:55] it is a new animation but B for balls I
[01:24:58] do like that b for balls
[01:25:04] B for balls okay I'm not looking at Chad
[01:25:05] now this is a purely stocks take sucrose
[01:25:11] all right it's a new animation which I
[01:25:12] value not just recycling wait is wait is
[01:25:15] there might be an idol actually wait I
[01:25:17] don't know her Idols no no
[01:25:19] no I feel like I've seen them no I don't
[01:25:20] like
[01:25:21] sorry relax
[01:25:29] wait I want to listen to Idol
[01:25:34] is it an idol I mean just see let me
[01:25:36] just see
[01:25:40] it's longer
[01:25:48] it's about to explode though
[01:25:50] okay it's basically the idol
[01:25:54] I mean it's honestly less
[01:25:57] yeah yeah it's it's height it's height
[01:26:00] I'm
[01:26:01] yeah and then doesn't disappear I don't
[01:26:03] think it's bad we have a bit of an over
[01:26:05] saturation in b
[01:26:09] we have so much in B though
[01:26:11] [Music]
[01:26:14] I think it's fine
[01:26:16] China
[01:26:19] well but who is this sucrose
[01:26:23] uh it's not memorable I [ __ ] already
[01:26:25] forgot about it it's not terrible it's B
[01:26:27] it's like I'm fine I'm putting not
[01:26:29] terrible in C tier but it's not bad like
[01:26:31] it's
[01:26:32] now that's
[01:26:34] I'm pissed I'm putting in C I don't care
[01:26:36] I don't care [ __ ] you even if it doesn't
[01:26:37] make sense I don't care it's like C
[01:26:40] shouldn't doesn't mean bad it's just
[01:26:42] like average and I feel like that means
[01:26:44] C A Lloyd
[01:26:47] [Music]
[01:26:50] all right guys I'm Eloy
[01:26:55] okay
[01:26:56] it's it's not D it's C I think Halo is
[01:26:59] not even here oh
[01:27:03] yeah
[01:27:05] it could be D but I mean I
[01:27:08] don't think it's
[01:27:13] what are you doing yeah yeah okay dude
[01:27:15] all right next up now the five star
[01:27:17] characters Whoa We Made It the good part
[01:27:19] all right surely five stars don't have
[01:27:22] recycled animations let's start with
[01:27:23] everyone's favorite Glee
[01:27:27] I love it okay I'm happy that she pulled
[01:27:30] up the jumpy Dumpty when she just
[01:27:31] tripped I was like lower in the tier and
[01:27:33] then jumpy Dumpty
[01:27:36] what do you think uh yeah it's an a I
[01:27:39] think was that a running enemy I'm not
[01:27:41] looking at chat
[01:27:43] yeah it's all right I agree it's all
[01:27:45] right it's beer in my opinion but I'm
[01:27:46] not necessarily or to go a or it's clean
[01:27:49] it's pretty cute
[01:27:53] hey Mona
[01:27:54] oh she pulled oh
[01:27:58] I actually like that I actually like
[01:28:00] that and I'm not even like a big Mona
[01:28:01] enjoyer but I kind of like that she
[01:28:03] appeared soon and then and it's not
[01:28:06] recycled either I like that I like that
[01:28:07] I like that no bias by the way there
[01:28:10] might be a little but I'll just say I
[01:28:11] like it what do you think uh I like the
[01:28:13] initial animation true and then I like
[01:28:16] the tip of the hat if it was just the
[01:28:18] this that would be a but then she also
[01:28:20] did that which I think adds character
[01:28:21] and Mona is kind of like that yes do you
[01:28:23] agree
[01:28:24] what
[01:28:26] is my son age for me
[01:28:29] I gave it an S yeah really
[01:28:32] ass ass Mona true yeah what that was
[01:28:36] weird
[01:28:38] okay why do you hate me yo hey oh my
[01:28:41] my lovers lady lovers can appreciate
[01:28:44] let's have a talk can lady lovers not
[01:28:45] appreciate uh well-designed character
[01:28:48] model
[01:28:49] [ __ ] you have our old skin on
[01:28:51] I think the new skin has shades of blue
[01:28:53] that I'm not a big fan of wait there's
[01:28:54] another skin yeah it's free you can have
[01:28:56] it I do
[01:28:58] immediately goes to have it do I capture
[01:29:00] her oh really we all got it in the mail
[01:29:03] at some point maybe it expired but
[01:29:06] I feel like you ever got it though
[01:29:07] actually yeah it's free you should have
[01:29:08] it Chad do new accounts have it at least
[01:29:10] it counts on you but like
[01:29:12] does everyone have it yeah this skin is
[01:29:14] actually kind of it's free forever yeah
[01:29:15] see I'm not gonna lie it's kind of mid
[01:29:16] yeah I agree
[01:29:18] let's save and
[01:29:21] all right next up are you okay I'm like
[01:29:24] afraid okay chichi
[01:29:27] doesn't change the fact that she's a
[01:29:28] dead zombie that was [ __ ] up I'm sorry
[01:29:31] let's run that back
[01:29:35] okay I feel like it almost
[01:29:38] it's like a burst animation but like
[01:29:39] it's very simple
[01:29:41] yeah I don't think it's I think
[01:29:43] chongkins is better I'm gonna be honest
[01:29:44] I like this better than just one of them
[01:29:47] that's him stealing it that's her
[01:29:48] breaking from it
[01:29:50] where did I put on Yoon
[01:29:52] a Shelby B
[01:29:54] I mean for a five star though it's kind
[01:29:56] of C no
[01:29:58] I would say c
[01:30:00] people are dead Okay damn that is [ __ ]
[01:30:04] obviously
[01:30:07] it could be B but I think see Yo Mia
[01:30:13] Joe's personality fireworks I think it's
[01:30:15] a little short for my liking but there's
[01:30:17] a little like firework thing she's happy
[01:30:19] B for bandages because I am a bandage
[01:30:25] I don't know what do you think about um
[01:30:29] what do you think
[01:30:30] I look
[01:30:36] yeah I think it shows a lot of
[01:30:37] personality and every minute I try to
[01:30:40] type in s which scares me because you
[01:30:41] made me and scare me
[01:30:43] like it's not that good okay it shows
[01:30:46] personality and for a character like a
[01:30:48] man who likes fireworks there's not much
[01:30:49] more you could do
[01:30:51] yeah I think it was a bit longer and I
[01:30:54] think you could add more so I think it's
[01:30:55] a because it's too short and even people
[01:30:57] who love you and me and have a poster of
[01:30:58] her on their wall and I'm giving me a
[01:31:00] bed sheets to be like yeah I wish it was
[01:31:01] longer to see Mario and Mia so I think
[01:31:03] it's a I mean why are you shading is
[01:31:05] that you
[01:31:07] remember me I love her
[01:31:09] you have your meal on bowline
[01:31:11] [Music]

[01:31:24] love the card oh okay I just love
[01:31:26] magicians though I'm like a big like I
[01:31:28] play like I like Twisted Fate from
[01:31:29] League I like other magicians I like
[01:31:32] this I like this a lot

[01:31:36] oh wanna see a trick and Lenny has rizz
[01:31:38] true fun fact
[01:31:39] is good I think that's S I mean that's
[01:31:42] potentially double s
[01:31:44] no no double s is like a we pretend it
[01:31:46] doesn't exist and then sometimes you
[01:31:48] know what
[01:31:49] tasty
[01:31:51] let's do it next to Lynette all right
[01:31:54] Dale
[01:31:56] that was trash
[01:31:58] dude I think that's the first step no
[01:32:00] way they take arguably the hottest
[01:32:01] character in the game and just give her
[01:32:03] up
[01:32:04] foreign
[01:32:20] I'm sorry I I love Daya but I'm
[01:32:23] just this D for disappointed no way
[01:32:28] oh it's like it's no it's like okay at
[01:32:31] least she walks forward a little bit bro
[01:32:33] she failed firebending fans she's an EST
[01:32:36] she's not she's a five star and I love
[01:32:39] Dale but it's like why do you do her so
[01:32:40] dirty man I'm actually coping deeper
[01:32:43] they did her dirty
[01:32:47] okay we're gonna skip that ayato
[01:32:52] what am I doing
[01:32:55] uh oh he keeps it out or it's not bad
[01:32:57] does it does it show in the parties a
[01:32:58] menu it does I kind of like that put my
[01:33:00] official duties to one side I like that
[01:33:02] he keeps the sword out
[01:33:04] um
[01:33:05] if he didn't it might be a B I think
[01:33:07] because of it it's an a question mark
[01:33:10] maybe it's
[01:33:12] maybe it's still B but yeah I think it's
[01:33:14] a it's pretty good
[01:33:19] yeah he's in love with it he's a stroker
[01:33:21] he's a stroker true
[01:33:24] yeah I think it's I I think b or a could
[01:33:27] be argued I'm gonna put it away
[01:33:29] I think it's pretty good
[01:33:30] okay next up we have big teeth
[01:33:35] oh I mean he plays with balls that was
[01:33:38] whoa let's run it back okay he kicks the
[01:33:41] ball catches it his ears like flingle is
[01:33:43] that a word flail
[01:33:46] I mean
[01:33:48] I don't think it's bad I think it's like
[01:33:49] you know but it's like it's like a b
[01:33:52] puppy died
[01:33:54] what do you think
[01:33:56] I wish his ears wiggled
[01:33:58] they kind of do they like no
[01:34:03] no Beaver ball true B for ball and the
[01:34:07] Bee
[01:34:08] next up shadow
[01:34:11] oh I forgot about that and it's double
[01:34:14] personality and it's like I like it
[01:34:18] better ghost
[01:34:20] there are a lot of aspects here so first
[01:34:22] of all there is the second Shanghai here
[01:34:24] with like the thing looks pissed has
[01:34:26] like the Angy claw and then the original
[01:34:28] is doing a spin and then does the like
[01:34:30] pose and then that's kind of basic but I
[01:34:32] like this so uh that raised it for me I
[01:34:34] really like it also because it's in the
[01:34:36] team
[01:34:39] um
[01:34:42] damn I mean I really like it
[01:34:46] ARS yeah I think it's a
[01:34:49] I think this thing makes me really like
[01:34:51] it just because it stays in the party as
[01:34:53] well it's like right here but if you
[01:34:56] just see her
[01:34:58] yeah I agree her doing this is not that
[01:35:00] much but I just Amazon
[01:35:02] yeah I agree I actually agree I think
[01:35:04] first thing good take
[01:35:07] I'm kidding why are you mad at me
[01:35:11] good job
[01:35:14] I think it's good though
[01:35:18] it's nothing
[01:35:20] I know we're not gonna I'm not right for
[01:35:22] that I'm not
[01:35:27] like I'm biased I love Shanghai so I
[01:35:29] like like this more but it's like it's
[01:35:30] what it's it's okay all right Aika
[01:35:37] I mean it's isn't that just like her
[01:35:39] skill which is like
[01:35:41] but I like that the fan is like there
[01:35:47] it makes sense where I could have that I
[01:35:49] think you can her on that skin is making
[01:35:51] me like you don't like the skin
[01:36:00] try with no skin
[01:36:02] oh the wait what why did your thing lift
[01:36:04] up here
[01:36:06] skin right I guess
[01:36:09] I mean I think it's like dude
[01:36:15] I think it's pretty good it's not like
[01:36:17] insane it's pretty good it's good
[01:36:20] yeah it's kind of her skill though her
[01:36:21] skill does this but it also makes sense
[01:36:27] not true I guess yeah I mean it's pretty
[01:36:29] good I think I think it's a low a
[01:36:32] age
[01:36:35] what do you saying
[01:36:37] it's not hard to animate a fan like that
[01:36:39] to like open and close so if I don't
[01:36:42] know about that
[01:36:44] you a lot
[01:36:47] I wish it held the Claymore if I speak
[01:36:51] in big trouble
[01:36:53] those who know comment and Eula right
[01:36:55] now because
[01:36:57] I know where I want to put you left but
[01:36:59] I don't think
[01:37:01] okay here's the thing objectively it's
[01:37:03] not that much but also we know what type
[01:37:06] of players julamanes are so this to them
[01:37:09] is s which means they accomplish what
[01:37:11] they wanted true or not true
[01:37:13] because you're you're playing Eula
[01:37:15] because Eula looks like EULA
[01:37:17] no one's like yeah man I want to play
[01:37:19] you look because I like having no crit
[01:37:21] rate and fighting enemies playing
[01:37:23] physical and missing my crit and missing
[01:37:25] enemies and resetting when anything
[01:37:26] Dodges my burst so clearly people who
[01:37:28] play Eula like YULA because she's Eula
[01:37:30] and because of that this is satisfying
[01:37:32] with that in mind I think it's like a
[01:37:37] for most people it's like an a for Eula
[01:37:39] Mains it's like a double s tier
[01:37:42] so it's probably like a
[01:37:44] what do you think
[01:37:49] also because she dances I think that's
[01:37:51] like very Eula core and there's the
[01:37:53] Claymore
[01:37:55] well she spins
[01:38:00] yeah someone called me a green physical
[01:38:02] Main
[01:38:03] [ __ ] you man it's his show because it's
[01:38:06] like you don't do reactions dude why are
[01:38:08] you laughing
[01:38:10] I actually okay
[01:38:12] everything my body's like like I don't
[01:38:14] know how to explain this it's like when
[01:38:15] I look at it I'm like this is a but then
[01:38:18] everything in my body's like this is s I
[01:38:20] don't know what that is
[01:38:22] what do you think
[01:38:24] I Am Not a Human mind so like I think
[01:38:27] it's an a what do you think Chad
[01:38:31] I know what that is huh okay why are you
[01:38:33] guys having huh yo it's called being a
[01:38:35] simp okay well that's a maybe it's an a
[01:38:38] then
[01:38:39] yeah I mean I can see it being a I can
[01:38:41] see it it's just the fact that she spins
[01:38:43] and then pauses here why are you pausing
[01:38:44] there like what are you doing hey
[01:38:48] uh what am I gonna say
[01:38:52] I mean does she even care about her
[01:38:54] Claymore though I didn't even know shaqs
[01:38:56] anymore
[01:38:58] what are you looking at her eyes her
[01:39:00] eyes she had
[01:39:02] her voice yeah but like she showed her
[01:39:03] eye though staring at them and then
[01:39:04] showed them against some respectful I'm
[01:39:06] respectful Gene
[01:39:09] I love characters that implement the
[01:39:11] actual weapons that you put on them wait
[01:39:13] let me make this one
[01:39:16] that's sick
[01:39:18] yo editor cut out the first one just
[01:39:20] play it now all right Gene
[01:39:24] [ __ ] don't wait
[01:39:27] I think it's pretty cool though it's
[01:39:29] like you know it's not much though I'm
[01:39:31] abusing this implementation wait that's
[01:39:34] sick though yeah it was pretty cool but
[01:39:37] the animation's not that much just like
[01:39:39] yeah but then look how her hair floats
[01:39:42] and how the dandelions started floating
[01:39:46] yeah I think it's like a b but it's not
[01:39:49] bad like I think B's pretty good I think
[01:39:51] it's B I think we're biased because it's
[01:39:52] five star characters now we're giving
[01:39:53] them all high rankings B why but no
[01:39:55] other character could do the the weapon
[01:39:57] switch like that leave me the weapon
[01:39:58] switch like showing a weapon some other
[01:40:00] characters did yeah look look at Thomas
[01:40:02] oh oh that's why he looks so mad
[01:40:06] she's pretty good though
[01:40:09] no that would not do anything
[01:40:11] and then see if you lose changes his
[01:40:13] mind
[01:40:14] I feel like the love that actually like
[01:40:17] yeah affected me okay but you played
[01:40:19] Tomah on fav
[01:40:21] I don't give a damn
[01:40:24] dude I mean the colorway like looks
[01:40:26] better it's an a it's an a whatever he
[01:40:29] was I probably would bump it up one more
[01:40:31] right
[01:40:33] all right Scaramouche whoa he flies in I
[01:40:37] swear
[01:40:41] okay here's what I like the flying in I
[01:40:43] think that's really cool I think what
[01:40:45] Mona did better wait actually wait did
[01:40:47] he do a thing with his hat he did right
[01:40:48] yeah he does like plink at us
[01:40:51] but I think Mona's so Mona does like a
[01:40:53] similar animation in but then Mona has a
[01:40:55] bit more sass I think the Mona sauce is
[01:40:57] a bit better
[01:40:58] um
[01:41:00] I don't want them I don't want them here
[01:41:02] right now I'm good
[01:41:06] um I like it
[01:41:07] but I'm not like Amazed by it
[01:41:11] it's like a dude you know what it's
[01:41:13] pretty good thing about his animation is
[01:41:15] if you have a team of three other
[01:41:16] characters and then you put scar out
[01:41:17] last you actually see him fly behind
[01:41:19] them and into his slot not really yeah
[01:41:23] so if you're shaking
[01:41:25] this would better be important oh
[01:41:28] the campaign wait spoilers that was ass
[01:41:32] by the way okay this would better be
[01:41:34] important oh I mean
[01:41:37] it's a nice entrance yeah
[01:41:41] still the same rank though I think it's
[01:41:43] good I could see why people put an S I
[01:41:45] think it's a
[01:41:51] he's still good
[01:41:54] I could see why it would be S but I
[01:41:56] think it's a I feel
[01:41:58] I feel seen enough of the five stars
[01:42:00] yeah
[01:42:02] I like this I like this a lot I like
[01:42:04] this a lot I like this a lot I think
[01:42:05] childhood of the bow looks dumb as [ __ ]
[01:42:06] child the swords smash
[01:42:09] platonically as a friend
[01:42:11] do you disagree I think this is sick
[01:42:13] yeah he spins the [ __ ] sword because
[01:42:15] child canonically his weakest weapon is
[01:42:17] a bow which is why he's using it because
[01:42:19] he doesn't really know how so he's
[01:42:20] trying to learn it which is why it's
[01:42:20] goofy animations look goofy but with a
[01:42:22] sword he's masterful and skillful and he
[01:42:24] can do and it turns into a spear I think
[01:42:25] this is really cool uh this is a era s
[01:42:28] for me
[01:42:30] what do you think
[01:42:32] what do you think yeah he looks like Ed
[01:42:34] Sheeran but other than that on his ass
[01:42:36] what do you think
[01:42:37] ars no is that his cape
[01:42:40] oh I like that it's floating I do like
[01:42:42] that as cave is doing that why does it
[01:42:44] look like it looks like it's not real
[01:42:45] well let's get oh I think when he's wait
[01:42:48] I've never like examined I've played
[01:42:50] child a lot but I've never like examined
[01:42:51] him when he uses this skill does it do
[01:42:53] that oh it does do that yeah that's a
[01:42:55] nice touch yeah I think that's cool I
[01:42:56] think it does s yeah what do you think
[01:42:59] you haven't spoken
[01:43:01] that's respectable but why do you want
[01:43:03] to speak
[01:43:06] in the zox live stream we value uh
[01:43:09] listening to everyone
[01:43:10] okay
[01:43:12] why
[01:43:14] like I want you to hear your opinion but
[01:43:17] it's not going to change my ranking this
[01:43:19] is like a zionics rank that's the name
[01:43:20] of the video but the friends give me
[01:43:22] like a reality check like socks shut the
[01:43:25] [ __ ] up you hear me Shut the [ __ ] up
[01:43:26] okay
[01:43:28] venti oh wait I didn't bring child
[01:43:31] I think he's s oh but there's not that
[01:43:33] many characters in ass no I think he
[01:43:35] fits it
[01:43:37] yeah yeah I think it is I think it is I
[01:43:40] think it is all right Venti
[01:43:43] well that's a nice touch
[01:43:45] it's pretty basic this looks like a
[01:43:47] default thing but then the the thing the
[01:43:49] the harp is pretty good
[01:43:53] his hair goes on his uh skill I think
[01:44:01] yes however I wish his eyes also glowed
[01:44:05] he could do more I like Venti
[01:44:10] um bendy is one of my favorite icons
[01:44:12] maybe favorite I'm not sure
[01:44:14] but just animation is like it's like a
[01:44:16] probably I love empty I think venti's
[01:44:18] amazing and P I think we take venti for
[01:44:19] granted because he's our first archon
[01:44:21] and he just introduced and you'll be
[01:44:22] like he's such a breath of fresh air as
[01:44:23] a character but people don't know that
[01:44:25] as a breath of fresh air because you're
[01:44:25] used to [ __ ] venti and then we see
[01:44:27] folklore being uh sassy which I like
[01:44:29] folklore people are like oh but venti
[01:44:32] literally the OG uh not the everyday
[01:44:36] character what am I saying I like benty
[01:44:38] but I think his animation is just an a
[01:44:41] no
[01:44:41] [Music]
[01:44:44] a for animal arkon dude I just
[01:44:50] s do you guys have high expectations I
[01:44:52] mean dude literally look at look at this
[01:44:56] this is so much okay if unless you want
[01:44:59] to put a Double S rank for this this
[01:45:00] isn't the same level in my opinion yes
[01:45:02] there's no way
[01:45:06] [Music]
[01:45:09] I just feel like there's so many ways to
[01:45:11] enhance his animation because he's an
[01:45:13] archon you know
[01:45:15] yeah dude Zhang Lee could take his shirt
[01:45:18] off because the Ark on skin with no
[01:45:19] shirt put that on screen
[01:45:21] yeah okay stop oh look it up oh look at
[01:45:24] what the topic I won't wait is that real
[01:45:26] wait it's real you know what's real yeah
[01:45:28] look look up Zhang Lee our Conquest uh
[01:45:30] archon outfit
[01:45:32] yeah he has no [ __ ] shirt on
[01:45:35] yeah but no like it chose this wait
[01:45:38] where is it
[01:45:39] okay this is the wrong one though holy
[01:45:41] clothes no no but like like this like
[01:45:43] this
[01:45:44] [Music]
[01:45:45] archon statue
[01:45:51] doesn't the statue of his yes he has his
[01:45:53] chest out
[01:45:54] oh that's him yeah it's wrongly with a
[01:45:56] hood
[01:45:57] the statue is hurtless that's what it is
[01:45:58] it might not be the actual outfit but it
[01:46:00] is the statue
[01:46:02] there should be a statue of me
[01:46:05] statue of the seven like BTS sorry
[01:46:08] let me switch back again wait where's my
[01:46:11] OB what is happening
[01:46:13] where's OBS oh there it is
[01:46:16] all right uh who is that ranking
[01:46:19] venti what'd you say
[01:46:22] I agree yeah Fang agree
[01:46:25] sorry I keep staring at you but
[01:46:28] well I kind of like this I mean it's
[01:46:31] pretty basic
[01:46:33] but I do like the Rock
[01:46:35] yeah
[01:46:39] wouldn't do something spectacular but do
[01:46:43] you notice like all the seals yeah I
[01:46:45] like The Rock
[01:46:47] no like the
[01:46:48] The Rock Dwayne Johnson
[01:46:51] sorry what do you think yeah like these
[01:46:52] things right that thought
[01:46:54] like right here
[01:47:00] oh
[01:47:02] yeah I mean he's about to say awesome
[01:47:04] anthos wine
[01:47:09] I think it's B
[01:47:11] like it makes sense for zombie to do
[01:47:13] this I kind of want to give it an A but
[01:47:15] on its own it's like a it's like a it's
[01:47:17] a light
[01:47:18] like there's just a meatballs
[01:47:22] how to make her some spaghetti
[01:47:26] where's my mouse he literally just
[01:47:28] literally just like a meatballs
[01:47:31] I have your order
[01:47:34] I mean it's all right like I don't know
[01:47:36] man I'm sorry it's not bad inside
[01:47:39] uh Albedo
[01:47:42] we made the flower out like that and
[01:47:46] he's like an alchemist Alchemy for what
[01:47:49] could equal the value of a human soul
[01:47:52] old Metal Alchemist Full Metal Alchemist
[01:47:55] Full Metal Alchemist those who watch it
[01:47:57] you know what I'm talking about I think
[01:47:59] this is good you're biased because you
[01:48:00] love Albedo I think it's like a no I
[01:48:02] think it's good he turns the sword into
[01:48:03] a flower exactly and it's your sword
[01:48:05] that you gave him so it's like
[01:48:08] I like it koi dial called me short we're
[01:48:10] dropping in a tear because of that
[01:48:12] um
[01:48:13] no I'm not no I'm not I really are no
[01:48:16] I'm not no I'm not no I'm not no I think
[01:48:20] it's S I actually think it's S I think
[01:48:21] it's good I think it's good like I'm not
[01:48:23] no bias I think this is good he turns
[01:48:25] your sword into a [ __ ] flower also
[01:48:26] shout out to the Albedo players who have
[01:48:28] Cinnabar spindle
[01:48:30] I was toxic
[01:48:33] all right we're getting more Esters on
[01:48:35] the board Luke I think I've seen the
[01:48:36] Luke's yeah he's just like yeah I mean
[01:48:39] wait that's it yeah like well he doesn't
[01:48:43] even put his hand down or anything yeah
[01:48:46] he's so pretty yes but let's go back to
[01:48:49] the grandma drip skin
[01:48:52] yeah it's
[01:48:55] C for [ __ ] because he's the kakamoto
[01:49:00] I don't think so it's just okay yeah
[01:49:02] it's
[01:49:03] like C
[01:49:05] it could be D it's C or DM
[01:49:09] yeah but I think it's like the little
[01:49:12] fire
[01:49:15] it's not very good and it's gone you
[01:49:20] know this part made it better but the
[01:49:22] star was literally just her burst that's
[01:49:24] literally her burst
[01:49:25] that's her burst
[01:49:27] and then it just like stays here people
[01:49:29] are looking at her her her her
[01:49:33] personality not at the animation people
[01:49:35] who are rating this very high are
[01:49:37] looking at her personality that's all
[01:49:39] I'm gonna say
[01:49:40] no
[01:49:43] burst plus Idol yeah I think it's nice
[01:49:46] it's a name I like that her ball spins
[01:49:48] yeah yeah okay I actually didn't oh it's
[01:49:50] like the bowler mode
[01:49:52] yeah it's actually not bad it's not like
[01:49:54] insane but it's okay it's like beer
[01:49:56] whoa s yeah
[01:49:59] yeah really
[01:50:01] I would take her on a date true because
[01:50:03] now Gandhi means are gonna like you and
[01:50:05] gunny means are very loyal so plus five
[01:50:06] million subscribers true I'm gonna say a
[01:50:09] I mean I'm indifferent on it so bra for
[01:50:12] me I'll just play I mean is it even a
[01:50:16] I mean Xin Yan say okay yeah there's a
[01:50:18] Oh Shannon is B man I'm sorry okay I'll
[01:50:20] keep her I'm sorry I'm sorry don't hurt
[01:50:21] me all right I think it's B my Jew
[01:50:27] he should have played with the snake
[01:50:28] more I'm sorry you could have whipped
[01:50:30] out a snake snake should have [ __ ]
[01:50:31] done some stuff
[01:50:32] that would be to animate his snake
[01:50:36] three words billion dollar company
[01:50:41] what the [ __ ] this isn't bad but the
[01:50:44] snake could have done more in my opinion
[01:50:46] uh so I think it's like
[01:50:48] crb
[01:50:50] maybe not C I mean what does he do let's
[01:50:52] look at him
[01:50:54] it's literally saved from tolerant he's
[01:50:56] doing a Rasengan what is that it's a
[01:50:59] Naruto oh you don't know
[01:51:03] it's like is there a thing on right
[01:51:08] it's good we also have sauce
[01:51:11] Sasuke yeah
[01:51:17] see
[01:51:18] [Music]
[01:51:24] that is a Marco meatball big [ __ ]
[01:51:27] Hammer he doesn't do too much with it
[01:51:29] though
[01:51:34] but like ushi is literally better than I
[01:51:37] crowned ushi yeah the cow yeah
[01:51:42] ushi's literally the best part of it
[01:51:43] though I'm not kidding
[01:51:45] look
[01:51:47] he's just jamming look he's literally
[01:51:48] jamming
[01:51:53] well he can say yeah usually would have
[01:51:56] made this way better but I think
[01:51:58] honestly it's still pretty good
[01:52:01] I'm like
[01:52:03] yeah I'm sad there's no ushi it makes me
[01:52:04] want to like be it almost
[01:52:18] okay I'm sorry how is he holding this
[01:52:20] big-ass Tamer with these tiny ass arms
[01:52:22] why didn't they just make him buff
[01:52:23] anyone any answers because he's not Bob
[01:52:26] we're gonna put him for beef or should
[01:52:27] have been buff
[01:52:29] true
[01:52:31] that's you
[01:52:32] I am so big I can't fit through door
[01:52:35] frames moving on
[01:52:37] this is sick the grumpy ghost that he
[01:52:40] turns into a cute little ghost I like it
[01:52:42] double ghost
[01:52:44] I agree this is really good this is
[01:52:47] really good this is probably the best
[01:52:48] one so far is it better than Lenny
[01:52:51] though Lenny though
[01:52:54] really good I think it's really good I
[01:52:55] think it's really good we'll determine
[01:52:58] double s later I think hudao is like as
[01:53:00] good as we've got it yeah yeah as as
[01:53:02] good as we've got it so far really good
[01:53:04] really really good really good right so
[01:53:06] it's a
[01:53:08] doctor yeah
[01:53:10] okay fine
[01:53:14] Nation rise
[01:53:16] that's not us too I love kokomi I love
[01:53:19] kokomi no bias though kokomi Nation I am
[01:53:22] going to step out for a second and take
[01:53:24] an un objective caded look
[01:53:28] Slim's in like the mermaid Hydro archon
[01:53:30] that she is
[01:53:32] which I like there's nothing else after
[01:53:34] she could do something after but go home
[01:53:36] he's already perfect so I'm not gonna
[01:53:37] ask too much of her
[01:53:38] I think it's pretty good
[01:53:43] four months of
[01:53:45] decisions as I head into grads okay she
[01:53:47] kind of showed us look right here what
[01:53:49] is this
[01:53:50] remaining dollars if you listen to
[01:53:52] reptile legit Minecraft songs you're
[01:53:56] welcome I like the way she spins in I
[01:53:59] actually like it I like it it's ARS
[01:54:02] like I want to give call me an ass
[01:54:04] because me but
[01:54:05] I mean it does fit her like what more
[01:54:07] could she do she could still have the
[01:54:08] little jellyfish if she summoned her
[01:54:09] groggy thing that would be like insane
[01:54:14] I think it's today nah I love cool
[01:54:17] really no but then we're we're like
[01:54:19] [ __ ] biased
[01:54:21] I'm also biased because I love kakumi
[01:54:23] wait why I just love Chloe okay I'm a
[01:54:26] combination it started as a meme but
[01:54:28] then I just love her so
[01:54:31] I think it fits her personality to like
[01:54:34] to swim in
[01:54:35] but I could see it being a I think
[01:54:39] for non-kakami fans
[01:54:41] how TF is Coco Anderson Wanderer is an a
[01:54:47] looks like I wonder
[01:54:50] this guy flies in she swims in wait
[01:54:52] that's actually kind of true yeah they
[01:54:53] are pretty similar
[01:54:56] okay but like people without logic would
[01:54:58] also say Mona's the same as wander but
[01:55:00] Mona has so much more sass yes Mona is
[01:55:04] objectively better here objectively I
[01:55:05] don't want to hear it you're delusional
[01:55:06] because you love scar too much and I
[01:55:08] love star too
[01:55:09] come is probably an A2 though I don't
[01:55:11] disagree
[01:55:13] without us
[01:55:15] which tells us actually
[01:55:17] though that people say okay I think the
[01:55:19] person saying that wants car to be S
[01:55:20] though but I disagree nah I disagree
[01:55:22] you're just wrong I'm sorry no I mean
[01:55:26] I mean like I'm down although half of
[01:55:27] Scar remains dude scar remains were like
[01:55:29] literally feral killing everyone to be
[01:55:31] like I love scarra so much and now
[01:55:33] they're literally the same but for Lenny
[01:55:34] it's like pick a [ __ ] character what
[01:55:35] now you swapped I swapped from I like
[01:55:38] I'll have them Endive yet but I was
[01:55:39] never like fighting for I'll hide them
[01:55:40] hey hey they're in my bed that's all I'm
[01:55:42] saying we're gonna put wandering a and
[01:55:44] kokomi and as well I think
[01:55:48] you okay
[01:55:54] scars is unique they're all [ __ ]
[01:55:56] unique Deluxe is unique and it's like a
[01:55:58] detier
[01:56:00] they're literally all unique this guy's
[01:56:01] Marco meatball and it's not that good
[01:56:03] you're just like you're like oh it's so
[01:56:05] unique because he flies in because he's
[01:56:07] flying motherless Haze oh true
[01:56:09] but like kokomis is also as unique she
[01:56:11] [ __ ] swims in because she's a mermaid
[01:56:12] so they're like the same level in my
[01:56:14] opinion I used to think Google is a bit
[01:56:16] better but I can see why that would be
[01:56:18] biased so I think they're the same level
[01:56:21] I think they're the same level
[01:56:24] but Dakota makes me happy she has like a
[01:56:26] little smile this has to be dude
[01:56:30] I think I'll put her a the star is the
[01:56:33] top of a like he's literally on the
[01:56:35] tippy top so what book I'm here too
[01:56:37] true
[01:56:39] Baker call me fan I at as a kokomi lover
[01:56:43] I would put her here but I know that
[01:56:45] that is not a I'm trying to be like a
[01:56:47] little less biased
[01:56:49] so we're gonna put it there
[01:56:53] following right now
[01:56:55] child take was also biased no dude
[01:56:57] literally swords Cape flowing whips
[01:57:00] spins it I think this is sick you guys
[01:57:03] are you guys are coping all right next
[01:57:04] up we got yolan
[01:57:08] okay oh this is the most important thing
[01:57:11] this is the most important thing if
[01:57:13] elon's dice rolled a random number and I
[01:57:15] could use it to like random stuff s
[01:57:18] easiest s of my life but I'm very upset
[01:57:20] that it always rolls a three why why
[01:57:24] yilon's Idol rolls a random number look
[01:57:27] yeah it's random every time look I would
[01:57:29] do the thing where I Advance someone if
[01:57:30] it's a six and they Flex look oh well
[01:57:33] she didn't do it
[01:57:34] anyways just trust me her Idol is always
[01:57:36] random but then her animation is always
[01:57:38] at three which tilts me
[01:57:41] but it's still good
[01:57:43] look I think it would have been double
[01:57:45] lasted if that's the case
[01:57:46] I mean maybe actually because you can
[01:57:48] roll the dice
[01:57:52] look see It's Not Gonna Roll three I
[01:57:54] mean there's a chance to rules of three
[01:57:55] but they roll the [ __ ] three okay but
[01:57:57] it's random
[01:58:00] I promise it's random it's actually
[01:58:01] random you can test it yourself I I
[01:58:04] believe
[01:58:05] one more we'll do one more okay imagine
[01:58:07] it rolls three twice then I won't
[01:58:08] believe you
[01:58:13] you're gonna be here forever
[01:58:20] dude how did it roll a three like
[01:58:25] please don't look at your bracelet just
[01:58:26] roll don't look at your bracelet don't
[01:58:27] look at your bracelet please please
[01:58:28] please please please Roll Roll Roll Roll
[01:58:31] Roll Roll she's not
[01:58:37] if it rolls three again I'm screaming
[01:58:39] okay yeah see it's random so I think it
[01:58:41] should have been random it's still
[01:58:42] really cool I think it's still sick and
[01:58:44] the code floats a little she rolls the
[01:58:46] dice catches it you roll the dice you
[01:58:48] pay the price I like it it should have
[01:58:50] been a random roll though which is what
[01:58:52] for me lowers it by one I think
[01:58:55] the animation is like an S if it was
[01:58:57] random because it's not random it's like
[01:58:58] a
[01:58:59] I mean there's also the whip thing which
[01:59:02] I like
[01:59:03] change the size
[01:59:04] I'm just really tilted that it's always
[01:59:06] a three so I'm gonna give it
[01:59:09] to actually see the number
[01:59:12] well it was worth it for me
[01:59:20] nilu dances Twirls spins amazing well I
[01:59:25] mean do it again
[01:59:26] it could add a little bit more actually
[01:59:31] I mean it's like
[01:59:33] I like the bats I think nilo's cool
[01:59:35] could have been a little more it's kind
[01:59:37] of like eula's but without the like it's
[01:59:39] kind of like this but no but like I feel
[01:59:42] like she should incorporate like that
[01:59:44] water flower that she does yeah there
[01:59:46] could have been a bit more animation
[01:59:48] yes or maybe even a little more of that
[01:59:50] water swirl
[01:59:54] swirl I like I like it I like it but
[01:59:57] there could have been a little bit more
[01:59:59] and it's not like it's hard to do a
[02:00:01] little more you could just add a little
[02:00:02] bit of water
[02:00:04] so nilu very pretty but I think it's
[02:00:06] like a BT animation in my humble opinion
[02:00:10] I loved it I saw this before I don't
[02:00:12] need this I don't need this I love it
[02:00:13] she swings in one more can you ask
[02:00:16] and then does the twirl it's
[02:00:18] by Marquis from nahida unless there's
[02:00:20] like a little aranara with her it's cute
[02:00:25] I think it's really cute I really like
[02:00:27] this one I don't care what anyone thinks
[02:00:28] for this one I think this is S easy I
[02:00:31] think it's just an easy ass
[02:00:33] she swings in is that did you agree
[02:00:38] and there I think there's more like
[02:00:39] there's like little like
[02:00:41] were there more animations I wasn't
[02:00:43] really looking yeah
[02:00:44] okay that thing goes too nice I'll hide
[02:00:47] them
[02:00:49] that was just like synchros I mean
[02:00:55] I'll hide them standing right here with
[02:00:57] whatever this is and this I think is
[02:01:00] already an ass but animation alone we
[02:01:03] put the bias at the door I don't think
[02:01:05] it's good because like singtel literally
[02:01:07] just does that and I was like that's not
[02:01:08] great it's the same thing man it's it's
[02:01:11] like
[02:01:12] it's so in character okay true I will
[02:01:14] add this so a heightened players don't
[02:01:16] hate me because I love item it is in
[02:01:18] character I'll hit the mood and do
[02:01:19] something fancy he doesn't give a [ __ ]
[02:01:20] he's just like dude shut the [ __ ] up I
[02:01:22] agree
[02:01:23] but I don't think I think that's a a
[02:01:25] like a just a copium justification for a
[02:01:28] bad animation so I think it's just like
[02:01:30] whatever it's like C
[02:01:32] do you agree yeah
[02:01:38] yeah this was gonna say like one of his
[02:01:40] anime I'm pretty sure one of the idols
[02:01:41] is like mirrors and it looks better so
[02:01:42] yeah I think it's like C
[02:01:44] and also give
[02:01:47] a gift is it wait yeah the book's also
[02:01:49] ugly I kind of want to make it a detour
[02:01:50] because the book is ugly as [ __ ]
[02:01:53] he's not a catalyst oh dude you were
[02:01:56] asking me if you're all if I'll hit the
[02:01:58] most battered was just you it's just you
[02:02:00] know
[02:02:04] yeah it's I'm sorry I love it but this
[02:02:07] is lokia D but because it's in character
[02:02:08] lowest C because I don't think it's like
[02:02:10] a tear worse than the Luke yeah
[02:02:14] all right next up Kuching
[02:02:16] I like that I like that she uses
[02:02:18] lightning silhouetto it's Justin's skill
[02:02:20] but it incorporates it she's not even
[02:02:21] there on screen at first teleports in I
[02:02:23] like it
[02:02:25] who says that who says that oh bailu
[02:02:28] from starrell
[02:02:30] I like this I like this a lot I like
[02:02:31] this
[02:02:33] yeah and it's very in character
[02:02:35] like compare that to gun years it's
[02:02:38] gonna use it's like so smooth and soft
[02:02:39] but hers is like very so like fast and
[02:02:42] then she like gets into a position so
[02:02:43] fast yeah it makes it makes sense I like
[02:02:46] it it's ARS for me
[02:02:55] I want to say a but like I don't see how
[02:02:58] they would make it better like unless
[02:02:59] they made her like I think it's just
[02:03:02] oh if she did hold the sword that would
[02:03:04] be oh truing
[02:03:08] I don't know though this could be ass
[02:03:11] igned a lot of Chinese films like you
[02:03:13] hold a knife on the other hand maybe
[02:03:15] it's a as long as I have to recycle but
[02:03:17] it's dude it's her skill what do you
[02:03:18] mean recycle it's literally
[02:03:20] what it's not like a idle animation it's
[02:03:22] literally using the skill into you
[02:03:25] I like it it's a hi
[02:03:31] what's up
[02:03:35] okay almost a year of this misery true

[02:05:18] let him walk home I think okay I think
[02:05:21] this pose is very cool for yai I do but
[02:05:23] I think there could be the Kitsune there
[02:05:24] could be a little bit more
[02:05:27] I think it's like it died
[02:05:30] I like that it stays here in the party
[02:05:31] setup I like that she looks like that
[02:05:33] when you're making a party I do but I
[02:05:35] don't think it's that impressive
[02:05:36] compared to this
[02:05:37] true definitely she doesn't SS for sure
[02:05:40] but this one is like a mess come on no

[02:08:27] wind stuff I like the flower stuff I
[02:08:29] think the leaf stuff not flower I like
[02:08:32] it it's probably a though I don't think
[02:08:33] it's like s
[02:08:36] I like it
[02:08:38] his friend is still dead so I
[02:08:41] was [ __ ] I'm sorry I'm sorry please
[02:08:44] don't put that in I'm sorry I think it's
[02:08:45] there pretty good all right lastly
[02:08:50] okay I've seen shouts before I like when
[02:08:53] Xiao has his mask on it makes me feel
[02:08:55] things let's look at it mask on mask off
[02:08:58] like dream
[02:09:00] sure oh it's so pretty okay no bias no
[02:09:04] bias
[02:09:05] look I think he looks really good here
[02:09:07] and he holds a mask and this is how he
[02:09:09] appears in the party setup which I like
[02:09:15] I could see this bro let me wait for the
[02:09:18] donut being over
[02:09:19] I could see this being a but I want to
[02:09:22] put this in s because I like that he
[02:09:23] comes up with the mask then he says oh
[02:09:25] it's you pulls it up and then looks at
[02:09:27] you becomes beautiful reappears it in
[02:09:29] his hand I like it
[02:09:33] s for short
[02:09:35] [ __ ] not
[02:09:42] okay this is the last one if the last
[02:09:44] pick is a bit biased that's fine but
[02:09:46] what do you guys thinking with the
[02:09:48] umbrella soon objectively think this is
[02:09:51] actually pretty good yeah
[02:09:52] what do you think
[02:09:55] uh
[02:09:57] let's talk louder
[02:09:59] it's an s
[02:10:00] true
[02:10:02] what do you think a
[02:10:04] I think a
[02:10:05] you said this was SS where's her mask
[02:10:08] he's like mask on mask off hey guys it's
[02:10:11] dream Minecraft okay listen and he's
[02:10:14] green like dream
[02:10:16] listen yeah I want to put him as s
[02:10:19] he could have lamented
[02:10:21] no but that's a thing like if he did
[02:10:24] lament I would get sad because he would
[02:10:26] be in pain but then do you know what I
[02:10:29] mean like I'm conflicted I like it I
[02:10:31] mean I'm also wearing a shower hoodie
[02:10:33] like I understand the bias here but I
[02:10:34] just I I don't know like
[02:10:36] okay I guess also if I'm a Charmaine I
[02:10:39] also have high standards for Xiao like I
[02:10:41] kind of like I was kind of like I put
[02:10:43] cook like wander and kokomi in the same
[02:10:45] tier and I like both of them I love I
[02:10:46] like them so like I want them to be S
[02:10:49] tears like I want their animations to be
[02:10:52] good to do justice for them so if
[02:10:53] they're not good I'll say hey they're
[02:10:54] [ __ ] I'll say it I'll say it but I think
[02:10:57] it's good
[02:10:58] I think it's good
[02:11:00] I agree
[02:11:02] nice ass
[02:11:04] I don't I still think kutao is better I
[02:11:06] still think even like Lindy's is a bit
[02:11:07] better but I think it's s
[02:11:09] ick look it breaks and then it forms
[02:11:11] yeah yeah oh juicy yes
[02:11:15] oh yeah under nahida though
[02:11:17] he doesn't we
[02:11:19] honestly I would have double acid I
[02:11:22] think it's just so cute I think it's too
[02:11:23] cute I think it's too cute because
[02:11:24] anything else you would have done would
[02:11:25] have been worse like if she did her alt
[02:11:27] or like the I mean this would have been
[02:11:29] cool too but it would be worse than the
[02:11:30] swing though unless she literally pulled
[02:11:32] up an rnara
[02:11:33] I think it would have been yeah I think
[02:11:35] this is really good
[02:11:37] I'm gonna put Nikita SS Lenny's could
[02:11:40] you could argue with us for lydney but
[02:11:45] yeah
[02:11:47] I don't know
[02:11:51] I like this I like this dude Nick he
[02:11:53] doesn't so good
[02:11:55] and then what if you solve it in fast
[02:11:57] you still see them waiting for you for
[02:11:59] ages
[02:12:01] go back to Nikita's I'm putting Lydia up
[02:12:05] woman heaters
[02:12:08] on the team yeah
[02:12:11] conquering demons is what I do
[02:12:17] there's flowers on them can I I'm gonna
[02:12:19] put this down to put it back to SS
[02:12:22] no but you can see some of the flowers
[02:12:24] I'll put in a different party slot yes
[02:12:27] shut up I hide them like I love you but
[02:12:29] like why you just say yes be more
[02:12:30] enthusiastic I'm sorry
[02:12:32] look there's literally flowers on the
[02:12:34] ground when they heat up like Pops in
[02:12:35] boom literally grows plants I like it
[02:12:38] all archons have an extra effect oh
[02:12:40] really what looks like I write it
[02:12:46] I mean there's a little bit of I guess
[02:12:48] she's like she looks like she's
[02:12:49] electrocharged
[02:12:50] okay what about the [ __ ] Marco
[02:12:53] meatball
[02:12:56] oh is that like the letters flying up I
[02:12:57] mean yeah we saw that vent and tea
[02:13:01] the wind is a nice touch yeah yeah that
[02:13:04] one's a nice touch did I put him in a
[02:13:06] I did put them in okay I'd keep it there
[02:13:13] yeah Ryden literally looks like she
[02:13:15] walked in water with her skill active
[02:13:16] and electrocharge herself
[02:13:18] like use your skill while she was wet
[02:13:21] they're like you know electric surgery
[02:13:22] like
[02:13:25] it's like the people I took the vaccine
[02:13:27] no okay
[02:13:33] yeah I think yeah I mean I think it's
[02:13:36] good uh
[02:13:39] do you agree
[02:13:41] no you disagree with like half of them
[02:13:42] yeah
[02:13:43] okay what what is what is I think
[02:13:45] overall I agree true
[02:13:49] writing this SS for the Asian mom energy
[02:13:51] what does that even mean
[02:13:53] she's Asian no I mean she's yeah but
[02:13:57] like
[02:13:58] what does that mean
[02:14:01] what do you mean Asian mom energy if my
[02:14:04] mom is mad she doesn't come in looking
[02:14:05] that hot she's gonna come in with a
[02:14:07] slipper and beat my ass like that's not
[02:14:09] there's a difference
[02:14:16] imagine I didn't pull this slipper
[02:14:21] uh
[02:14:25] this one's still gutted
[02:14:28] and she looks so like happy
[02:14:30] smile
[02:14:32] she just smiles
[02:14:39] dude don't show Daya every time you show
[02:14:41] day I want to cry yeah this is stuff
[02:14:45] like there's so much potential wonders
[02:14:47] is growing on me I like that he dashes
[02:14:48] in but I'm gonna shut up if I wonder
[02:14:50] because then the wander man's like yeah
[02:14:52] you're so right put him in it
[02:14:54] that's how they talk about it no
[02:14:56] disrespect what animation do you think I
[02:14:58] think that's good I think this could do
[02:14:59] oh he works out his Hydro clock I've
[02:15:00] seen it I've seen hey hey I've seen it
[02:15:04] he would probably have like you were
[02:15:06] walking home tonight I don't know about
[02:15:07] Nevada Quest I don't know his
[02:15:08] personality yet so I can't really tell I
[02:15:10] just like how he looks and is
[02:15:13] okay what about our lakino
[02:15:15] should be like no she doesn't stop what
[02:15:17] did she do oh yeah remember she stabbed
[02:15:19] in the trailer
[02:15:20] and then she pushed him and then lights
[02:15:22] out under your computer
[02:15:26] that'd be great I was gonna pull for
[02:15:28] yato once he comes back around in 4.2
[02:15:31] and I was wondering which one yeah
[02:15:34] she has the best she doesn't keep up the
[02:15:38] content do you hear that I didn't hear
[02:15:39] that
[02:15:41] how do I know here's a Dono

[02:15:49] don't know oh prototyping sucks so maybe
[02:15:52] it was a leak I don't know I actually
[02:15:52] didn't hear it so whatever better that
[02:15:54] way I guess I don't know
[02:15:57] place in yours animation oh well
[02:16:00] oh actually I have it I have it but I
[02:16:02] have to keep it on mute because it's
[02:16:03] copyrighted
[02:16:04] Senora's animation
[02:16:09] what is that
[02:16:14] I mean muted I don't get copyrighted
[02:16:16] this is Senora's animation right
[02:16:22] it's not loading that is so awkward

[02:16:36] [Music]
[02:16:41] well anyways sorry senior remains see
[02:16:44] you later
[02:16:52] okay what do you guys think Chad
[02:16:54] any of these takes terrible Now's the
[02:16:56] Time to review
[02:17:02] instead of what you're laughing at your
[02:17:05] setup
[02:17:06] my setup
[02:17:11] you're not just trash
[02:17:19] totally a joke you're a joke
[02:17:22] mine is one viewer
[02:17:28] missed a lot of potential Hero's not bad
[02:17:31] she's still where is she
[02:17:33] I guess she is C no no what whoa whoa
[02:17:36] what dude I just dude if you're a
[02:17:39] [ __ ] cat box why don't you show it
[02:17:41] bro I don't think it's C maybe it is
[02:17:44] maybe everyone's gonna say it's
[02:17:47] cool maybe Kira's B I don't disagree but
[02:17:50] like I don't think it's good
[02:17:57] uh kazo's asked Jose
[02:18:05] yeah I like it it's very wholesome
[02:18:08] useless is good I don't think it's like
[02:18:10] insane though
[02:18:13] imagine if you lose left the sword there
[02:18:15] and then exploded after like however
[02:18:17] many seconds it lasts
[02:18:21] no it's not an actual Claymore it's like
[02:18:23] her ice fall sword or whatever
[02:18:26] how
[02:18:27] look at itos yeah but Ito like it makes
[02:18:29] sense for Ito because he like whips it
[02:18:31] out but like you do the same
[02:18:37] that was a French question mark That's
[02:18:38] how you pronounce question mark in
[02:18:39] French
[02:18:41] true Fontan lore I mean I'm pretty good
[02:18:46] first time chatter wander ass shut the f
[02:18:49] I don't even disagree but if wanted to
[02:18:50] ask so that they're just a package deal
[02:18:53] you want to put them both as you can
[02:18:54] okay that's all I don't even disagree
[02:18:56] either both above that's it's the same
[02:18:58] thing okay if in your head captain
[02:19:00] they're both ass and they're both s sure
[02:19:12] anything else I missed I think we're

[02:19:28] could put both scarra and kokomi S but
[02:19:30] it's up to you because it could be uh
[02:19:32] then cut there and then hands boom and
[02:19:34] then now they don't hate me true and
[02:19:35] then we put it back

[02:30:20] hundred like let's say 88 of them are
[02:30:22] guaranteed that means that 150 out of
[02:30:24] the 300 that's left will lose their 50
[02:30:26] 50. so 150 people that like this comment

[02:35:41] why is our camera oh [ __ ]
[02:35:44] oh
[02:35:46] it's back
[02:35:48] hey hey
[02:35:52] it's back to the review okay the thing
[02:35:54] with Nikita and her Goblin right now you
[02:35:57] know even all field Em's usually a bit
[02:35:58] better than crit or Denver damage up to
[02:36:00] a thousands but it's only a little bit
[02:36:03] better so if you have really good
[02:36:04] substance if your substance are dog [ __ ]
[02:36:06] on em dendro's probably gonna be better
[02:36:08] it depends if your onfield off-field
[02:36:10] team comp all that [ __ ] but like if you
[02:36:11] have a good what the [ __ ] is this
[02:36:14] uh oh that's the best I got I promise
[02:36:17] bad that's the best I got
[02:36:20] oh okay I mean yeah I mean it's fine
[02:36:23] it's actually I mean it is what it is
[02:36:25] this is on set so it could let you go
[02:36:27] and offset something if it rolls like
[02:36:28] this has Em which is good if the last
[02:36:30] subside here is crit rate or damage
[02:36:32] actually good for Nikita apparently the
[02:36:34] calf made the camera has a thing oh
[02:36:36] I get
[02:36:39] all right well how many artifacts yo
[02:36:41] gold strong box what do I strong about
[02:36:44] or something we don't know your account
[02:36:45] yet but whatever you need yeah
[02:36:48] I fixed this account wait this could be
[02:36:50] good I'm not throwing that oh this could
[02:36:52] actually be good
[02:36:53] okay I'm not gonna let's just Auto add
[02:36:55] [ __ ] it
[02:37:02] okay
[02:37:04] yeah okay em goblet is fine for now yeah
[02:37:06] that's fine uh it's not even that young
[02:37:08] well that is bad it's just your em
[02:37:10] goblet is bad yeah
[02:37:12] oh my God whoa is that good I mean where
[02:37:16] did my stream
[02:37:18] [ __ ] I don't know sometimes I feel like
[02:37:20] people with
[02:37:21] don't care about Credence yeah okay so
[02:37:23] if you're playing a hyperloom character
[02:37:24] kooky right
[02:37:25] she doesn't give a [ __ ] but what nahida
[02:37:28] does is she does a lot of damage too so
[02:37:30] the reason why Em's gonna hit us because
[02:37:32] there's like em scalings are here but
[02:37:34] also there's this
[02:37:36] which Buffs your team based on your uh
[02:37:38] the highest characters Em which can
[02:37:41] oftentimes be Nikita and there's this
[02:37:42] which is the main reason because you
[02:37:44] from your em you gain damage you gain
[02:37:45] Denver damage or just damage percent and
[02:37:48] you can criterate
[02:37:49] so because you gain criterate and
[02:37:51] because like you're Nikita em gives you
[02:37:54] damage type of thing
[02:37:55] so it's like
[02:37:57] I don't know how to explain this it's
[02:37:58] like because he doesn't damage dealing
[02:37:59] character she also wants great does that
[02:38:01] make sense
[02:38:02] but like if you're not a damaging
[02:38:03] character like kooky isn't then you just
[02:38:05] want em because what does how does
[02:38:06] cookie deal damage is hyper for them
[02:38:08] it's not her scalings unless you're
[02:38:10] playing Quicken but if you play quick
[02:38:11] and kooky literally call me on my cell
[02:38:14] phone and then we'll talk it's not even
[02:38:15] bad but it's a lot worse it doesn't
[02:38:16] matter that's my uh I digress so yeah
[02:38:19] that's what I like in my humble opinion
[02:38:22] this goblet
[02:38:24] now I am a cursed artifact roller I'm
[02:38:27] probably gonna make this real bad but if
[02:38:30] I roll this and it gets a bunch of crit
[02:38:31] then it's just way better than the other
[02:38:32] one
[02:38:33] so let's see let's see are there any
[02:38:34] plus 20 here that you don't why are they
[02:38:36] all unlocked
[02:38:37] bro these are good are they I mean some
[02:38:39] of them aren't like the first one this
[02:38:41] is better than mine okay
[02:38:43] let's save it yeah I'm not gonna unlock
[02:38:45] all of them but you should do it dude
[02:38:48] these are all good are they yes
[02:38:53] throw it out
[02:38:57] okay this is kind of ass but it's 20 ER
[02:38:59] I'm not gonna throw it they'll get wait
[02:39:01] throw that out right I mean 22 that
[02:39:02] could be good I don't know what you're
[02:39:04] saying okay this is bad this is just
[02:39:05] objectively bad I mean I guess Shanghai
[02:39:07] but she's like I don't use her though
[02:39:09] you have her uh I don't even know I
[02:39:12] don't think I ever
[02:39:14] Chuck can I throw this whatever need
[02:39:16] this
[02:39:17] I mean that's a lot of VR I'm not gonna
[02:39:19] throw it I trust it
[02:39:31] okay what the [ __ ] is this
[02:39:35] we're gonna roll this and if it gets
[02:39:37] crit then it's just I mean even if it
[02:39:39] doesn't this is already better than
[02:39:40] internet okay your goalie gives you like
[02:39:41] nothing so surely we got crit it's not
[02:39:43] ziox lock okay well
[02:39:45] I'm sorry I yeah I mean what do you
[02:39:49] expect when I roll an artifact whatever
[02:39:51] this still wasn't the wrong decision it
[02:39:53] was still sometimes in life you do
[02:39:55] everything correct and you still lose
[02:39:56] for example you you literally you're
[02:39:59] like okay I planned perfectly for my
[02:40:01] first job interview I'm ready I'm going
[02:40:03] four hours in advance and then boom
[02:40:05] there's like a thunderstorm everything's
[02:40:07] canceled you don't get the job so
[02:40:08] sometimes you
[02:40:11] I'm sorry I'm actually sorry dude it's
[02:40:14] still okay this looks bad right this
[02:40:17] looks bad this looks bad it's still
[02:40:19] better than your current one it's still
[02:40:21] better what's your current one
[02:40:23] it's literally I mean yours not dude
[02:40:25] it's literally still better though I
[02:40:27] mean
[02:40:29] at least I will get one shot right
[02:40:31] there
[02:40:33] all right why is this Plus 17.
[02:40:37] I ran out of artifact uh I mean this is
[02:40:40] all good for you on though ER is good HP
[02:40:41] is good crit rate is good this is good
[02:40:43] for her uh flower what this is insane
[02:40:45] feather this is insane also oh yeah yeah
[02:40:48] that's good it's good that's good this
[02:40:50] is really good
[02:40:52] okay okay can't hold them all
[02:40:55] true but
[02:40:57] yeah you're so good suck but it happens
[02:40:59] you can straw mocks emblem now then it's
[02:41:01] new it's in there if I've uh it's kind
[02:41:03] of local damage
[02:41:04] what's your weapon
[02:41:06] so that's pretty good
[02:41:08] um

[02:41:53] yeah do you have enough ER
[02:41:56] you might want a little bit more yarn
[02:41:58] but that's a work in progress just try
[02:41:59] to look for ER in your sub stats because
[02:42:02] for you right now
[02:42:04] uh usually like you go five Cosmo if you
[02:42:06] know that much you are but if you have
[02:42:07] pretty much better if you have enough VR
[02:42:10] so you might need a little bit more
[02:42:12] uh Ibis piercer
[02:42:14] is that that's pretty good right
[02:42:16] I low-key I haven't seen this weapon oh
[02:42:18] yeah I know it is yeah it's the event
[02:42:20] it's yeah yeah it's not bad for melting
[02:42:21] on you because you get em
[02:42:22] um if you're playing mouth it's fine
[02:42:24] uh you can always use prototype Crescent
[02:42:27] I have that uh or Hama Yumi
[02:42:30] um
[02:42:31] but it is pretty good
[02:42:33] it's height wanders let's look at it
[02:42:36] that's good because how do you play on
[02:42:37] your mouth right because of this well
[02:42:39] okay this looks good uh I'm concerned
[02:42:41] about your crit rate
[02:42:44] yo
[02:42:45] freeze right no okay that's not bad
[02:42:48] though right
[02:42:53] yo
[02:42:55] why don't you have wait why don't you
[02:42:57] have good rate
[02:42:58] I mean
[02:43:00] I mean like if
[02:43:03] like three minutes in the abyss like
[02:43:05] doesn't it
[02:43:07] even though it's like one to five I mean
[02:43:09] doesn't it average out like like okay
[02:43:11] there's this this this is true okay this
[02:43:14] gives you some crit rate and then you
[02:43:16] also have
[02:43:18] um you could have cryo resonance no but
[02:43:21] it doesn't work with melt because melt
[02:43:22] is pyro so you might have 20 more but
[02:43:24] even if you are getting that it's still
[02:43:26] [ __ ] not that high you want more you
[02:43:28] want like you still want you want one to
[02:43:30] two no damage yeah you want as close as
[02:43:34] possible to one to two factoring this in
[02:43:36] like plus 20 if no reason
[02:43:38] so you still want to do you want more
[02:43:40] credit like at this point a criterate
[02:43:41] circle is better like if you do yeah I
[02:43:44] mean you don't have a wonders one but
[02:43:45] let's say it's like let's say it's this
[02:43:46] right
[02:43:48] this isn't better
[02:43:50] I mean with the 20 crit rate it's a bit
[02:43:51] high on crit right now because it'd be
[02:43:52] 86 172. wait actually 200 is not bad
[02:43:55] it's not bad wait what 8200 is not bad
[02:43:58] 80 to 200 yeah yeah that's not bad why
[02:44:02] oh wait
[02:44:03] oh but mine's 40. without it why do you
[02:44:06] say 80. oh because I was adding to 20
[02:44:08] you know with what you just had
[02:44:11] I'm gonna scream so Luke do you play
[02:44:13] Luke no oh he's trash okay
[02:44:18] special you just got a new set
[02:44:21] so official was like pretty official
[02:44:23] okay official was pretty broken then
[02:44:25] they added dendro and then she became
[02:44:26] even more broken then they gave her
[02:44:27] characters and weapons and then she
[02:44:28] became a bit more broken and then they
[02:44:30] give her an artifact set that increases
[02:44:31] her damage by like 20 so now she's like
[02:44:33] stupid
[02:44:34] um so if you get the new artifact set
[02:44:37] yeah she gets even better it's the news
[02:44:39] it just came out it's called Uh gilded
[02:44:42] troop golden troop golden troop sure
[02:44:44] it's a new domain really good official
[02:44:47] uh pretty [ __ ] cracked
[02:44:49] wait what are you doing
[02:44:55] wait you actually play
[02:44:58] I might do rational
[02:45:01] why are you just saying keywords
[02:45:03] rational
[02:45:08] application okay so you're saying you
[02:45:11] have a problem
[02:45:12] so bad really okay you need to level
[02:45:15] this skill oh level the skill to [ __ ]
[02:45:17] eight it's really important nine even
[02:45:20] skill is the most important part
[02:45:22] okay you have I mean that's fine but you
[02:45:24] want poor gilded on him
[02:45:26] wait how is this all height and bad okay
[02:45:28] this is dog [ __ ] this is also bad but
[02:45:30] outside of that house is bad
[02:45:32] okay you know what I do EQ
[02:45:36] oh
[02:45:39] yo no wonder it's bad this guy okay no
[02:45:42] flame but this guy was like I kind of
[02:45:44] regret I hate them bro you are you look
[02:45:47] like Eula right now even ayaka would
[02:45:50] want more could rain
[02:45:52] dude almost not really but dude with no
[02:45:56] wonder
[02:45:58] do you not have a criterate circle
[02:46:00] it's over here
[02:46:04] okay so that's better yeah ideally go
[02:46:06] for gilded uh dream like farm this
[02:46:09] domain is really good
[02:46:11] um
[02:46:12] this is good but it's crit damage you
[02:46:13] don't want good times but it yeah
[02:46:16] dude what the [ __ ]
[02:46:22] still low but it's better it's something
[02:46:24] Bros Curtin wants a patch
[02:46:28] yeah uh that is definitely crit rate
[02:46:32] this is not even Plus 20.
[02:46:34] no wonder this guy feels bad
[02:46:37] wait oh
[02:46:38] I'm postponing this I don't care oh yeah
[02:46:41] sure
[02:46:42] I think I gave up on it well you have no
[02:46:44] [ __ ] Mora
[02:46:46] it's not great this piece isn't gray but
[02:46:47] like
[02:46:48] you should far more gilded than people
[02:46:50] told me to do story Quests for gold
[02:46:53] oh I mean I guess that's true you could
[02:46:55] also just use resin
[02:46:57] I gave a second chance the shangly
[02:46:59] that's pretty good
[02:47:02] nice smart still you need more careers
[02:47:04] dude this goblet literally makes me want
[02:47:05] to scream you don't have a better one no
[02:47:07] the central it doesn't like I have no
[02:47:09] dendril man
[02:47:11] okay yeah that's unfortunate wait what
[02:47:13] is that [ __ ] what the [ __ ] did I just
[02:47:15] see huh dude what is this
[02:47:19] is that good what do you mean it's not
[02:47:20] good this is like the insane oh what the
[02:47:25] [ __ ] all right well
[02:47:28] anyways I'm gonna show you this items
[02:47:31] genuinely not bad you're floor eight
[02:47:33] sure where can I showcase this
[02:47:35] let's do it for a million you don't know
[02:47:36] how Vermillion unlocked
[02:47:39] wait good wait for a million go go
[02:47:43] why would I ever do that stuff though
[02:47:45] it's good it's good okay that's good
[02:47:47] that's that's that's sad face
[02:47:51] all right let me show you though
[02:47:54] uh well how do you only have six teams
[02:48:01] wait there's ten now wait do i chat am I
[02:48:04] dumb I thought I only had eight
[02:48:06] is it always been tandem I'd have always
[02:48:07] been ten I thought it was only eight
[02:48:09] okay I'm done I'm done don't talk to me
[02:48:12] you're dumb it's always been 10 yes
[02:48:13] you're dumb it was 10 for so long you're
[02:48:15] dumb I'm dumb I thought it was eight I
[02:48:17] don't know why
[02:48:19] okay look I'll show you I'll hit them to
[02:48:20] hito official or no no you don't
[02:48:23] official here you want I like the nahida
[02:48:25] cookie yeah
[02:48:27] if you need a heater for other team he's
[02:48:29] like yeah yeah or you could use
[02:48:31] uh and then official
[02:48:32] or like there's a few things you do but
[02:48:34] let's just use this round
[02:48:35] [ __ ]
[02:48:37] it's always been 10. yeah well wait so I
[02:48:39] can't count the rotation no
[02:48:42] so you want his burst let me just uh
[02:48:45] this should give us energy
[02:48:50] okay you have no ER
[02:48:52] well they're gonna die here but
[02:48:53] basically what you do is like Nikita e
[02:48:54] you can burst to if you want then your
[02:48:56] lawn burst but I'm not gonna use it
[02:48:57] because that'll bias it okay so look
[02:48:59] we're just gonna cookie eat and then
[02:49:01] I'll hide them and if you're low ping
[02:49:02] you can do a thing where you I'll hide
[02:49:03] them burst then you swap the cookie you
[02:49:05] eat and that's okay well I got knocked
[02:49:07] around but you could eat and then saw
[02:49:08] back to hide them before it's too late
[02:49:10] but like
[02:49:12] well yeah but we didn't do anything
[02:49:16] like we didn't do [ __ ] uh mirror on the
[02:49:18] back I got knocked around let's let me
[02:49:21] show you something normal wait you have
[02:49:22] no ER though
[02:49:23] you know what maybe your ER piece was
[02:49:25] actually worth it wait are we still on
[02:49:27] it no we're not
[02:49:29] wait how do you have no ER
[02:49:31] I didn't roll any
[02:49:33] okay yeah no [ __ ] but
[02:49:37] um
[02:49:39] second chance to shangly wait is this
[02:49:42] not another
[02:49:43] unfortunately whatever
[02:49:47] I saw you a good healer actually I I
[02:49:49] mean she's not like the best
[02:49:52] she's okay it's like a budget Gene
[02:49:54] usually not great
[02:49:58] these rotations here I'll hit him with
[02:50:00] e-punch no because I don't want to teach
[02:50:01] that rotation
[02:50:03] if you start if you start and you want
[02:50:05] three mirrors you could do hold e and
[02:50:06] then plunge to get three mirrors
[02:50:07] instantly basically how do you always
[02:50:09] don't have three mirrors but I want to
[02:50:11] show you like if we have more than three
[02:50:12] mirrors so I'm just gonna do this and
[02:50:14] then this and then catch the energy on
[02:50:16] this guy and that's a lot of [ __ ]
[02:50:17] energy
[02:50:18] still didn't get his burst uh I'm gonna
[02:50:20] do another E actually
[02:50:23] take it easy all right
[02:50:27] can we create
[02:50:28] oh it's R1 that's why
[02:50:30] okay so look
[02:50:32] we're gonna pretend they're not marked
[02:50:33] you mark them then you would yell on but
[02:50:36] [ __ ] it
[02:50:37] now watch this
[02:50:39] you have three mirrors instantly right
[02:50:40] so it's always gonna be three and then
[02:50:42] after four seconds you use your e or
[02:50:44] your charge ax then you keep on three
[02:50:45] and then everything's dead but like you
[02:50:47] obviously like you're playing three
[02:50:48] characters right now like yolan's not
[02:50:49] here so Yolanda do a lot more and also
[02:50:52] if you're only playing these three then
[02:50:52] official to do a lot more the only
[02:50:54] reason you play cookies because they get
[02:50:55] along
[02:50:56] because you want a hyperboom like if
[02:50:58] you're not hyperboleing facials way
[02:50:59] better honestly need a Healer but you
[02:51:01] probably don't okay anyway so yeah
[02:51:03] because if you start with E then you
[02:51:05] have two mirrors and you know what do
[02:51:07] you know what's better than two mirrors
[02:51:09] three three mirrors yeah
[02:51:11] true
[02:51:12] I said bro can't Dodge listen Bud
[02:51:14] dodging is a waste of DPS
[02:51:19] you sound so nerd right now
[02:51:21] wait
[02:51:24] okay wait don't you always explain this
[02:51:27] stuff to your channel yeah but they're
[02:51:29] dumb sorry sorry not distracted
[02:51:32] why is YouTube's Ox here okay
[02:51:36] that was all uh I mean I would show it
[02:51:38] in the abyss we got a base eight so or
[02:51:40] like nine so I don't really
[02:51:42] is there a hard I mean I guess this new
[02:51:43] domain is kind of hard did you oh you
[02:51:44] didn't [ __ ] oh you did huh oh do you
[02:51:47] do it yet huh
[02:51:49] stop calling me
[02:51:54] English
[02:51:58] doesn't expect them to retain all of it
[02:52:00] that's why there's time stamps
[02:52:02] Link in the description if you're
[02:52:03] interested
[02:52:05] okay we'll do this domain for you
[02:52:07] first
[02:52:10] Savage
[02:52:12] I'll just you shoot this guy at crits
[02:52:14] right what the [ __ ] new enemy wait does
[02:52:15] this even have weak points wait Chris
[02:52:17] fine okay watch so we're gonna mark them
[02:52:19] oh hi Mark everybody
[02:52:27] no watches all of our damage now is
[02:52:29] green
[02:52:30] and now we're [ __ ] this guy up and
[02:52:32] your artifacts could be a lot better if
[02:52:33] you wanna like build it or some [ __ ] but
[02:52:35] like oh I did a two mirror there that
[02:52:36] was my bad but yeah and then you like
[02:52:38] proc stuff and then here there is the
[02:52:39] two major you should have done a short
[02:52:40] attack I wasn't really counting but
[02:52:41] basically every four seconds you wanna
[02:52:44] do either a chargeback or your skill so
[02:52:47] that you uh gain a mirror before your
[02:52:49] mirror disappears and then like here I
[02:52:51] would boost well you would use your
[02:52:52] other characters first which is almost
[02:52:53] as it doesn't matter and then like you
[02:52:55] have three mirrors because it flies down
[02:52:56] like let's say two mirrors would be this
[02:52:57] well does it proc with no Enemy No but
[02:53:00] two mirror would be like a spin
[02:53:01] and then one mirror is a different
[02:53:02] animation but the one things are flying
[02:53:04] that means you have three yeah and
[02:53:07] you get two mirrors from using your
[02:53:08] skill and you get two mirrors you get
[02:53:11] one you get two years in the skill if
[02:53:13] you have no mirrors
[02:53:14] but usually you already have mirrors
[02:53:16] because you burst first so you'll gain
[02:53:17] one mirror from scaling and then you get
[02:53:18] one mirror from charge attacking an
[02:53:20] enemy but it has to hit an enemy you
[02:53:21] could also if you want to do a rotation
[02:53:23] with three mirrors at the start
[02:53:25] and you don't have your birth you could
[02:53:27] do uh e and then charge back or more
[02:53:29] advanced but better is you could do hold
[02:53:30] e and then if you hold it you can try
[02:53:32] you can plunge and then back to your
[02:53:34] third mirror you have two and then the
[02:53:34] punch is your third but you don't need
[02:53:36] to learn that just because people over
[02:53:38] complicate I'll hide them and then he
[02:53:40] seems hard but he's not you just burst
[02:53:41] then Auto attack then after a little you
[02:53:44] eat then after a little you charge that
[02:53:45] that's literally it you don't need to
[02:53:46] count four seconds just you feel it
[02:53:48] after a bit worst case you do a two
[02:53:50] mirror attack because you [ __ ] up it's
[02:53:51] not that big of a deal
[02:53:52] but it's four seconds
[02:53:55] Starbucks
[02:54:05] okay
[02:54:06] chat
[02:54:07] I love you guys I'm gonna be home
