[01:52:24] bit better in that regard however Still

[02:00:52] shoot on sight
[02:00:54] ready
[02:00:58] ow flat HP and attack I can't okay like
[02:01:02] I I see people all the time being like
[02:01:04] if your circlet only has one crit stat
[02:01:07] and no other good stat it's not a good
[02:01:09] circlet dude [ __ ] you okay if my crit if
[02:01:12] my if my one substat crit piece has 40
[02:01:14] crit damage I'm sorry I'm going to use
[02:01:16] it okay I I know it's like the odds of
[02:01:19] it hitting that aren't high but like the
[02:01:21] circl suck dude do you know the reality
[02:01:23] of ciret I'll click I'm ar60 I'll click
[02:01:26] on a random ciret I have and I guarantee
[02:01:28] you it's going to look mid okay cuz
[02:01:29] circlets like this isn't even that good
[02:01:31] man and like I'm an AR [ __ ] 20
[02:01:33] million player look at this one look at
[02:01:35] this one we'll do a [ __ ] oh like like
[02:01:37] like like like I don't know I don't know
[02:01:39] I'm
[02:01:42] [Music]
[02:01:46] sorry also I think we've gone full
[02:01:50] circle okay the er1 was good but like it
[02:01:52] kind of goes to
[02:01:54] show it had one or two crit rolls which
[02:01:57] means if you get a piece with like four
[02:01:59] crit rolls and no ER it would be like I
[02:02:02] don't know better on some worse on some
[02:02:04] which is whatever don't talk to
[02:02:09] me okay this one I mean this one could
[02:02:12] actually be
[02:02:13] good I know now I'm coping
[02:02:18] but J This months okay I think we've
[02:02:22] gone full circle though I think we've
[02:02:23] gone full circle from crit being
[02:02:26] overrated to crit being underrated cuz
[02:02:28] dude it's like okay substat efficiency
[02:02:30] definitely matters more than like most
[02:02:31] things however especially with things
[02:02:33] where like reactions can crit or you're
[02:02:35] like aggravating or you have like a
[02:02:36] split scaling character it's like it
[02:02:38] dude it's just like the best atat like
[02:02:40] it's not even close half the time
[02:02:42] sometimes it is you might be playing
[02:02:43] hyper blo then don't build crit but
[02:02:49] like aboba despair

[02:05:08] on five Echoes okay I could just remove
[02:05:09] one one Echoes and go off past but it's
[02:05:11] fine this is more impressive okay okay

[02:05:23] actually my best piece this is lowkey my

[02:05:31] okay I think I have a better flower
[02:05:33] actually well I don't know like crit
[02:05:36] value wise I do but the ER is actually
[02:05:39] uh it's not good cuz my IO does not need
[02:05:40] ER but for aasha maxing you actually
[02:05:43] need ER which is cringe but it's fine
[02:05:46] wow I care about a leaderboard more than
[02:05:47] the game [ __ ] you I'm talking to myself
[02:05:50] right now I don't I don't know I'm I'm
[02:05:59] sorry Hi Mr ZX I'm turning 18 today if
[02:06:03] you can please review it's 67 million no
[02:06:06] but happy
[02:06:11] birth23 what do you think about this
[02:06:13] emote at ziox Pepe ww okay this [ __ ] is
[02:06:17] I'm sorry no disrespect impacts but this
[02:06:18] [ __ ] is ass this might be the wor of all
[02:06:22] time hey looking for some help do you
[02:06:25] run capano with his delusion or his no
[02:06:28] uh I like running capitano's delusion uh
[02:06:31] no say Capitano is not bad but the
[02:06:33] problem is you need Senora for that team
[02:06:35] and uh also probably tarita but it it
[02:06:38] depends how you want to play it you can
[02:06:39] also do finina I just don't like it
[02:06:41] because the team you need like five
[02:06:42] stars for the team and it's also a bit
[02:06:43] harder it's not harder to play but it's
[02:06:45] like kind of boring and the Damage
[02:06:46] cealing isn't as high it's not bad
[02:06:48] though but uh if you run him with his
[02:06:50] delusion uh being able to do like
[02:06:52] consistent po damage with Shang Ling as
[02:06:55] like a battery he's an on Fielder you
[02:06:56] can battery your Shang Ling as well and
[02:06:58] you don't really need benett like Ben is
[02:07:00] great in that team don't get me wrong
[02:07:01] but because Capitano isn't just an
[02:07:02] attack scaler uh you don't actually need
[02:07:05] it and Capitano you can actually buff
[02:07:06] your Shang Ling with Senora as well if
[02:07:09] you want a bit more of a quick swappy
[02:07:10] team so I like to run Capitano with his
[02:07:12] delusion but you can kind of do
[02:07:14] whichever you want it's just a play
[02:07:16] style difference right you can watch my
[02:07:19] Capitano guide when it's out um but but
[02:07:21] it is going to be very long because
[02:07:23] there's obviously two sections depending
[02:07:24] on how you play them
[02:07:27] so [ __ ] you
[02:07:36] dog anyways uh
[02:07:46] Vermilion dude I've been watching uh
[02:07:49] what is it called
[02:07:51] dungeon meshy like the the the D the
[02:07:54] show where it's like adventurers but
[02:07:56] they want to they're like trying to kill
[02:07:58] dra a dragon but just to eat it cuz
[02:08:00] they're like
[02:08:03] hungry it's actually good I've been
[02:08:05] enjoying I have like four episodes left
[02:08:06] I'm almost done it's actually really
[02:08:12] good time to
[02:08:16] tesy who's your favorite the [ __ ]
[02:08:19] dwarf seshi
[02:08:23] I like that guy he's
[02:08:28] funny CI there you go okay why is he in
[02:08:32] um like no no flame but why is he
[02:08:35] wearing
[02:08:37] like okay I mean you know what he's
[02:08:39] wearing like why is he wearing that like
[02:08:40] all good
[02:08:41] but thanks do much for beetle is still
[02:08:44] Northern line build
[02:08:46] yes team
[02:08:48] Fallen I like Fallen but like
[02:08:51] wait who even is Fallen I don't even
[02:08:53] know is that like the the sister or is
[02:08:55] that the dwar the elf I
[02:08:58] see well I I can't I don't know I'm not
[02:09:00] really on team elf because anytime
[02:09:02] there's an Elf character I'm just like
[02:09:04] Free Run's better so I don't really care
[02:09:06] oh the
[02:09:07] sister she's
[02:09:11] cool okay I'm not yo I thought it was
[02:09:13] like
[02:09:18] a uh I thought I watched like okay so I
[02:09:22] was like watching the open it I thought
[02:09:23] it was like this could be good but we
[02:09:26] already have a good flower but it could
[02:09:27] be good it could actually be
[02:09:29] good I thought it was like an albo and
[02:09:32] then I was like oh wait what the [ __ ]
[02:09:33] attack double crit we lock
[02:09:41] that I can watch F and I tried but got
[02:09:43] bored okay but that's the thing it's
[02:09:45] like it's not like a hype anime it's
[02:09:46] just like cozy and like cool and like
[02:09:48] I'm more of a hype type of person but I
[02:09:50] don't know it's enjoyable I find it's
[02:09:53] pretty
[02:09:53] chill
[02:10:05] but but
[02:10:07] like you you should you should watch it
[02:10:09] if you want to watch it don't watch it
[02:10:11] if like if everyone tells you to watch
[02:10:12] something you don't want to watch it
[02:10:13] you're going to be like this is
[02:10:14] overhyped but like if you're like ooh
[02:10:16] like let me watch this and then you'll
[02:10:17] be like oh that's good I don't know like
[02:10:20] every time some like dude you have to
[02:10:21] watch Arcane I'm like dude [ __ ] you I
[02:10:23] don't want to watch Arcane but like I'm
[02:10:25] sure I'm going to watch it at some point
[02:10:26] like well this really good I should have
[02:10:28] watched it earlier and I'm cognizant of
[02:10:30] that I'm I I know that but like right
[02:10:32] now I don't want
[02:10:34] to like that's going to be me when the
[02:10:36] getet anime drops I'm like dude watch
[02:10:38] the gene you're like dude [ __ ] you I
[02:10:39] don't want to and then you're going to
[02:10:40] watch you like oh it's good I don't know
[02:10:42] if it's going to be good or not but
[02:10:55] guaranteed to be ass uh I think
[02:10:58] you're I think you're coping
[02:11:01] brother it might be but like isn't isn't
[02:11:04] it UFO
[02:11:14] table okay here's my pred yo this is
[02:11:16] like a a 5year pre-order prediction that
[02:11:19] might age terribly okay get anime
[02:11:21] prediction from 5 years in advance is
[02:11:23] going to get stalled for 5 years it
[02:11:24] might be bad okay it might be however my
[02:11:26] prediction is it's going to be something
[02:11:28] that doesn't really follow like entirely
[02:11:31] genin Quest lore it's not going to be
[02:11:32] like one to one it's be like their own
[02:11:33] take on it and it's probably going to be
[02:11:35] a good Standalone show I don't know it
[02:11:36] might not be but it'll probably be a
[02:11:38] good Standalone thing but then all the
[02:11:40] like annoying people that no one likes
[02:11:41] you're be like actually it's not the
[02:11:43] same as the manga adaptation and then
[02:11:45] it's going to and then so they're going
[02:11:47] to hate it but hopefully I mean I dude
[02:11:50] cuz there's no way they introduce all
[02:11:51] the [ __ ] story lines of every [ __ ]
[02:11:53] ass character that no one cares about in
[02:11:55] the current archon Quest so they're
[02:11:57] going to have to do something different
[02:11:58] it's not going to be like the same thing
[02:12:00] we start in
[02:12:01] monat [ __ ] Vin I mean hopefully they
[02:12:04] showed valin but there's no way we see
[02:12:06] every random ass character there so it's
[02:12:08] going to have to be something
[02:12:12] different
[02:12:14] anyways okay can someone teach me the
[02:12:16] monat song cuz I always sing the wrong
[02:12:18] one monat song like I I think the
[02:12:21] animation's going to be good cuz the
[02:12:22] studio is good but I don't know if like
[02:12:25] maybe they'll [ __ ] up the lower but I
[02:12:26] don't really care about like I care
[02:12:27] about how do I say this I care about
[02:12:31] like if it's good not if it's one to one
[02:12:34] to the game like I think no one cares if
[02:12:36] it's one to one from the like even like
[02:12:37] you know I don't think anyone cares
[02:12:39] about
[02:12:42] that lore
[02:12:46] Skipper no but you don't want it cuz
[02:12:49] like yeah
[02:13:04] a duel is a battle of wills what's like
[02:13:07] oh I need to look up monat City
[02:13:10] theme if your heart monat City theme
[02:13:14] sword may as like I feel like the genin
[02:13:16] story is already told very well in game
[02:13:19] so there's no reason to just tell it
[02:13:20] again through an anime like it should be
[02:13:22] it should be coherent with it like it
[02:13:24] shouldn't be like fully contradictory
[02:13:26] but there's no it shouldn't be like the
[02:13:27] same
[02:13:31] thing oh
[02:13:37] [Music]
[02:13:41] this wait this is actually
[02:13:46] Nostalgia did I just feel myself aging
[02:13:55] I've faced

[02:20:48] would be like I I wouldn't be hungry
[02:20:51] anymore like okay think about it right
[02:20:53] you give someone a PS5 they sell it they
[02:20:55] get food and then they study to become a
[02:20:59] doctor and then they research and they
[02:21:00] cure like a disease and then because I
[02:21:03] gave them a PS5 now they they save like
[02:21:06] thousands of
[02:21:07] people or what's more uh useful to
[02:21:11] society than a doctor a genin streamer
[02:21:14] so what if they with the PS5 they
[02:21:16] started streaming genin
[02:21:21] I see
[02:21:22] everything that would be
[02:21:25] sick shoot
[02:21:31] on
[02:21:33] enough
[02:21:45] enough okay well this domain [ __ ]
[02:21:47] sucks wasn't I supposed to prep for
[02:21:49] Emily
[02:21:54] oops you're creating a competitor for
[02:21:56] you what the the [ __ ] do you mean
[02:21:58] competitor time to
[02:22:00] testify the no my my viewers can't watch
[02:22:05] two streamers I need all the
[02:22:08] viewers
[02:22:18] no oh this could be good
[02:22:23] oh this could be
[02:22:28] good you stream once a month no I don't
[02:22:31] manly axe picker if I
[02:22:35] did I actually don't have anything to
[02:22:39] say J
[02:22:45] mons cooking is something only hum do
[02:22:49] and increase in brain size why can't you
[02:22:53] cook
[02:22:54] properly
[02:22:57] what I can
[02:23:10] cook Chad I'm thinking of watching uh
[02:23:14] the Deadpool and Wolverine movie with my
[02:23:16] dad tomorrow or maybe not tomorrow but
[02:23:18] like this week is it good I want to know
[02:23:20] my brother said it's
[02:23:21] good ready ew what the [ __ ] do you type
[02:23:25] ew mid okay that means it's good if
[02:23:28] twitch chat think something is mid it's
[02:23:30] probably pretty good dude you guys say
[02:23:32] everything's mid I'm sorry but also I I
[02:23:35] I don't think I like I can enjoy I enjoy
[02:23:38] [ __ ] even if it's like really bad like I
[02:23:40] I think if a movie is bad enough that
[02:23:42] it's like stupid I think it's like Peak
[02:23:44] like this is going to be my worst take
[02:23:45] of all time but I [ __ ] love like dog
[02:23:48] [ __ ] Fast and Furious movies cuz they're
[02:23:49] just so bad they're good and then it's
[02:23:51] like the best thing ever help me get a
[02:23:53] girlfriend before getting yourself AO go
[02:24:00] okay I watched the room with zadra was
[02:24:03] really
[02:24:05] good I did not hit her oh hi
[02:24:15] Mark I turned off fast three cuz it was
[02:24:18] so bad not 5 minutes ago okay but you're
[02:24:20] not like in the really bad ones you have
[02:24:22] to watch like fast 10 or like whatever
[02:24:24] it's called like like the like the newer
[02:24:25] ones they lean into how bad like it it
[02:24:27] turns into like a okay my logic is like
[02:24:30] when I enter the cinema and I'm watching
[02:24:32] a fast and furious movie I I tell myself
[02:24:34] it's a superhero and when it's a
[02:24:36] superhero movie and whenever they touch
[02:24:37] a car they become a superhero so like
[02:24:39] now it makes sense why the cars are like
[02:24:41] [ __ ] flying cuz like obviously you
[02:24:43] can't go that fast in like reverse but
[02:24:45] if they become superheroes it all makes
[02:24:46] sense and then it becomes Peak I'm sorry
[02:24:49] I'm sorry just is what it is what it is
[02:24:52] sorry you can't appreciate true
[02:24:58] Cinema
[02:24:59] anyways
[02:25:02] um okay maybe it's time for Abyss
[02:25:05] reviews land isn't this the [ __ ] uh
[02:25:09] archon the the what the [ __ ] is there
[02:25:11] what are they called Aon the hunt Aon
[02:25:14] and [ __ ] like the horse dude half
[02:25:16] horse half cocka
[02:25:23] I
[02:25:30] land okay I'm
[02:25:45] not evil shall be dispersed
[02:25:57] y sorry uh
[02:25:59] anyways Chad I think it's
[02:26:03] time dude Honestly though cuz we were
[02:26:05] talking about sh L earlier I might
[02:26:06] actually make a new Shang Ling guide
[02:26:08] dude the last one is 2 years old if
[02:26:10] there's anything maybe there's something
[02:26:11] new in that land like she might she
[02:26:13] probably synergizes like pyro archon's
[02:26:15] pyro but I feel like I'm going to make
[02:26:16] dude it's two years old like it deserves
[02:26:18] a new one
[02:26:20] so I'll probably make a new shling video
[02:26:22] uh kind of soon I I'll probably wait for
[02:26:25] Nan but
[02:26:28] yeah maybe Emily too
[02:26:42] actually we'll see maybe not
[02:26:53] hopefully she gets powercraft no
[02:26:55] hopefully she
[02:26:57] doesn't dude I'm sorry you guys are just
[02:26:59] mad that the [ __ ] four stars that
[02:27:01] they regret making are so good you could
[02:27:04] literally skip like three entire regions
[02:27:07] and you'll still have a good account if
[02:27:08] you have like the early what the [ __ ]
[02:27:10] you have the early characters although
[02:27:12] okay to be fair like we've gotten some
[02:27:15] broken ones but
[02:27:21] okay I have to pee I don't feel like
[02:27:23] getting
[02:27:29] up are least power cre turns off field
[02:27:31] pyro
[02:27:32] app
[02:27:36] maybe but also
[02:27:39] like I feel like even if I had a
[02:27:41] character with more
[02:27:48] pyro I guess it depends how
[02:27:55] much like you'd play with like
[02:27:57] nevet cuz some nevet teams can run just
[02:28:00] a Shang Ling or like a de or some [ __ ]
[02:28:02] but a lot of teams that already have
[02:28:04] Bennett like Shang Ling does so much
[02:28:05] [ __ ] damage even if she's on like fav
[02:28:08] ER anyways I have to
[02:28:10] be one
[02:28:19] sec
[02:28:49] for for
[02:29:29] whoa
[02:30:01] T what the [ __ ] does do this IRL glorp
[02:30:16] mean kind of crazy that Sino overload
[02:30:19] with DEA is actually meta
[02:30:22] now dude like you're are you trying to
[02:30:24] stunlock me or what is your definition
[02:30:26] of meta have you ever met a woman
[02:30:30] sorry in TCG oh okay but
[02:30:42] like I got
[02:30:48] baited dude if TCG had ranked I'm not
[02:30:51] kidding I'd be I would play it like just
[02:30:53] add rank I know they would never add
[02:30:55] ranked but I'm not kidding if they did I
[02:30:57] would be rank one or at least the
[02:30:58] highest rank whatever it is whatever
[02:31:01] Challenger is I'd get it you think I'm
[02:31:05] joking but they don't have [ __ ]
[02:31:07] ranked what do you want me to do play
[02:31:08] for fun ah it's actually hidden mm enter
[02:31:11] a tournament why what the [ __ ] would I
[02:31:14] do that
[02:31:41] oh am I here you should make genin Auto
[02:31:44] chest dude I'm not even kidding that
[02:31:46] would be [ __ ] that'd be fire but Al
[02:31:50] they probably wouldn't make ranked so it
[02:31:51] would suck but if if there was a
[02:31:56] ranked Kevin V won 16k today okay but
[02:32:01] like I know that's a lot of money but if
[02:32:03] for getting first place in a tournament
[02:32:05] that you probably like prepped for for
[02:32:06] like a year to two years that's kind of
[02:32:10] like not even good
[02:32:13] motivation like obviously like you know
[02:32:15] good for him but I
[02:32:22] I mean how much were Hearthstone
[02:32:23] tournaments back in the day Hearthstone

[02:39:38] sorry maybe maybe okay sorry maybe we
[02:39:40] get do it I have to open these on my
[02:39:42] second monitor just in case okay sorry
[02:39:45] sorry sorry what is this one Skilling my
[02:39:48] issue in force 12 mobile
[02:39:50] edition yeah we respect mobile players
[02:39:54] oh
[02:39:55] my I mean we respected what is this team
[02:39:58] uh ayat official DMC BYU so a hyper Blom
[02:40:03] team
[02:40:04] uh oh wow this is like slow motion okay
[02:40:08] first of all I would
[02:40:15] recommend okay first of all for hyper
[02:40:18] Bloom I would recommend a dedic DC at
[02:40:19] hyper Bloomer that's not fishal so
[02:40:21] fishal is a solid Electro character
[02:40:23] don't get me wrong but for hyper blo you
[02:40:26] could you could use it as a second
[02:40:27] Electro but you would want someone who
[02:40:28] hyper so either if you have an anemo
[02:40:30] with fishal like a sugr she can swirl
[02:40:32] the electro hyper bloom or you can run
[02:40:33] like a Kookie a em Ryden but here or
[02:40:36] like a burer and then FAL as Electro but
[02:40:38] here uh FAL is definitely not enough cuz
[02:40:40] FAL doesn't really Target
[02:40:42] cores and you're not building fully em
[02:40:44] on FAL so this team is kind of cooked
[02:40:46] like you you would want uh like you play
[02:40:49] if baiju was Kookie or something else be
[02:40:53] a lot better okay what
[02:40:57] the you didn't even
[02:41:01] summon okay
[02:41:05] I I'm tired man I'm tired let's let's go
[02:41:08] to the next half what is this next
[02:41:11] half
[02:41:13] oh what okay this actually I mean
[02:41:15] usually you run like a Kazo or sucos
[02:41:17] here but you know strong Le for Comfort
[02:41:19] sure let's look at your rotation J The
[02:41:22] Shield
[02:41:24] okay I mean that's fine
[02:41:33] whatever I
[02:41:36] mean
[02:41:38] um it's okay
[02:41:57] it's okay I
[02:42:04] I I mean your phone's lagging so I feel
[02:42:06] bad but you probably shouldn't uh like
[02:42:09] waste your child e like use your other
[02:42:11] characters and then swap the child
[02:42:12] generally let's see how you group them
[02:42:15] okay never mind swap the Shang Ling
[02:42:17] funnel the particles swap the sh Ling
[02:42:19] fin the E on Bennett then swap the Shang
[02:42:21] Ling to give her
[02:42:24] part or don't Pyon I mean that's that's
[02:42:27] fine too okay Al for okay I mean I
[02:42:30] usually range form alt in this team with
[02:42:32] child but I mean Pyon Nat with no
[02:42:35] Bennett buff okay yeah I'm sorry please
[02:42:37] if you ever press strangling q and
[02:42:39] Bennett in your team make sure you
[02:42:40] snapshot the Bennett buff let's look at
[02:42:41] your builds okay let's look at your
[02:42:42] builds uh cuz this game play I I can't
[02:42:45] right now I'm sorry let's look at your
[02:42:46] builds
[02:42:49] also you definitely want more Hydro for
[02:42:50] the Pyro lectors typically but let's
[02:42:54] look okay heart of depth that's good
[02:42:57] good
[02:42:58] flower decent feather decent feather
[02:43:01] that's a good sense that's a good goblet
[02:43:04] okay your child's actually
[02:43:07] good Polar Star
[02:43:13] C1 okay um that is 22k HP on jly that is
[02:43:17] like oh my God that is a very low HP
[02:43:20] Jong
[02:43:22] Le
[02:43:25] um okay I don't know but attack geoc
[02:43:27] crit I would I would highly recommend at
[02:43:29] least an HP sand uh you don't you don't
[02:43:31] need it like if you don't need the
[02:43:32] shield you know you you can go damage
[02:43:35] but there's no real
[02:43:39] Point why is your crit rate 36
[02:43:51] all right Addicted to You 34 Stars first
[02:43:55] half Yia Yan yunin jangi second half
[02:43:59] nevet finina fishal kazwa not sure if
[02:44:01] it's a team diff or a skill diff but
[02:44:02] most likely a device diff now no flame
[02:44:05] to anything here but I'm just saying if
[02:44:06] you're running yoia Carey and nevet KY
[02:44:08] and you can 36 star all I'm going to say
[02:44:12] is the problem isn't nevet I didn't say
[02:44:14] it was y I just said it's not nevet I
[02:44:17] just said it's not maybe it's your
[02:44:18] device May maybe it's your build maybe
[02:44:20] it's your skill but I'm just saying it's
[02:44:21] not never let let's look let's look
[02:44:23] let's look I'm sorry let's look I don't
[02:44:25] judge a book by its cover let's
[02:44:30] look okay let's
[02:44:33] look I look I'm not saying what it is
[02:44:35] and what it isn't okay all right you got
[02:44:37] a lot of characters well a decent amount
[02:44:40] like a solid amount to build good teams
[02:44:42] if this is up to me on building teams uh
[02:44:44] obviously you want a lot of hydro for
[02:44:45] the second half so never let fin make
[02:44:47] sense right your other team would
[02:44:48] probably be
[02:44:49] if you want to get funky like I'm a Soo
[02:44:51] lier even though he's not the most meta
[02:44:53] I would play like Soo Nita maybe like
[02:44:54] yolan Ki uh but let's say you don't want
[02:44:57] to play Sono you you could play like
[02:44:59] kaching Nikita kazua and then like
[02:45:01] fishell that's a a solid solid aggravate
[02:45:03] team I would play that uh even thisis is
[02:45:06] good uh but if you want your Kazo with
[02:45:08] nevet you can of course you can also
[02:45:10] play sucro first half you could play
[02:45:11] like a jeang Lee uh second or something
[02:45:16] but yoia yolan yunin jangi good pretty
[02:45:21] like it's it's a good Yia team I like
[02:45:22] running bit with my uh Yia but yunin is
[02:45:25] good as well they're pretty
[02:45:26] interchangeable depending on on a few
[02:45:28] factors you could also run both but okay
[02:45:31] um Okay Ice Spice in the title what do
[02:45:34] you mean ice Spice in the
[02:45:36] title I like
[02:45:44] men yeah I mean you know good for you
[02:45:46] that's cool
[02:45:51] yep good card for Yia as well and net
[02:45:53] actually good card in general okay what
[02:45:55] are you going to do here jongi that's
[02:45:56] fine uh Jang on Fab I like that I like
[02:45:59] that yon okay ooh this is I mean sorry
[02:46:04] just like the that's not your fault okay
[02:46:06] this is I
[02:46:08] mean this is
[02:46:10] fine like Yia is not like the most AOE
[02:46:12] for this but like it's okay it becomes
[02:46:13] single Target after this so far this is
[02:46:15] fine okay you could burst here yep yep
[02:46:18] okay okay
[02:46:22] swap quiet okay oh double e on y La at
[02:46:26] least see one I don't know what
[02:46:27] constellation you are but at least see
[02:46:28] one this quality is uh excuse the
[02:46:30] quality but it's okay okay what is this
[02:46:34] yep
[02:46:37] sure okay you should probably
[02:46:41] yep hold e get the F particles funnel
[02:46:44] that to no I mean I guess I was going I
[02:46:46] would have went y but I mean it doesn't
[02:46:47] matter you got your uh yon burst yunin
[02:46:50] burst Yia e boom yep okay solid rotation
[02:46:54] okay you know I think you know what
[02:46:55] you're doing with this team uh obviously
[02:46:58] here there's a lot of enemies so oh wait
[02:47:00] that's your problem okay first of all
[02:47:02] Yia in sing in single Target cool
[02:47:04] against a lot of enemies not as cool
[02:47:06] unless you're running like Kazo or
[02:47:07] strangling or something but well not
[02:47:08] strangling but like Kazo but here please
[02:47:11] kill the summons I think this is your
[02:47:12] problem kill the summon you kill the
[02:47:14] summon the enemy gets stunned and they
[02:47:16] take damage kill the [ __ ] the bird
[02:47:18] kill the bird kill the bird kill the
[02:47:21] bird kill the bird kill the bird kill
[02:47:25] the bird kill the they're not killing
[02:47:27] the bird but outside of that good
[02:47:29] rotation
[02:47:33] solid yeah I mean honestly 830 is not
[02:47:36] like that bad uh like you want usually
[02:47:40] like you can try to clear bit faster
[02:47:41] than that but it's fine net finina
[02:47:44] official Caza good
[02:47:45] team
[02:47:47] okay there's no healer here outside of
[02:47:49] nevet self healing but I mean you know
[02:47:52] it's
[02:47:53] enough uh sure you didn't need the COO
[02:47:57] burst but it's fine get some swirls in
[02:47:59] it's not bad yeah this is fine this is
[02:48:04] fine you might want to Kazo throw the
[02:48:06] hydro
[02:48:07] yep wait where did your stars go you're
[02:48:10] doing
[02:48:11] fine offishal some yep some in the
[02:48:13] official coo burst here like coso burst
[02:48:16] is good but like see how low they were
[02:48:17] like little things like this might help
[02:48:19] you get an extra star if you only get
[02:48:20] two stars here for example it's like
[02:48:21] they're so low that net charge attack
[02:48:24] basically insta pops them cuz you
[02:48:25] already solled Hydro you just never let
[02:48:26] charge attack here you already have the
[02:48:27] balls out after official e and like this
[02:48:30] guy's going to pop like doing kaz's
[02:48:31] burst animation is kind of a waste of
[02:48:33] time it's not bad but like now you push
[02:48:35] them away and now look they're not
[02:48:36] grouped at all okay you probably just
[02:48:37] need to group that's like yeah cuz now
[02:48:40] they're I mean Nev can kind of hit both
[02:48:42] he's broken enough for that okay you
[02:48:44] missed three okay well that was kind of
[02:48:46] a skill issue but it's fine okay okay
[02:48:48] never mind you are oh you didn't even
[02:48:50] get balls oh you did get balls okay you
[02:48:52] hit I thought I missed okay you hit you
[02:48:55] hit I mean yeah here you could even
[02:48:59] never let Auto attack apply some Hydro
[02:49:01] if you don't have your e up okay you
[02:49:03] have your e you're
[02:49:04] fine oh dude you got in
[02:49:10] okay okay if you don't get a star here
[02:49:14] that's entirely cuz you got knocked back
[02:49:15] like six times against those lectors me
[02:49:17] I reset there or or like even using your
[02:49:19] burst there like realistically right
[02:49:22] look like here he's like one Auto attack
[02:49:25] maybe two from breaking you don't need
[02:49:27] to use your burst you could Auto Dash
[02:49:28] towards the enemy then burst and use
[02:49:29] your like at least save your charge
[02:49:31] attack here for the enemies like now
[02:49:32] you're wasting it and then you wasted
[02:49:34] like maybe a second of it and then by
[02:49:36] the time you get to the enemies it's
[02:49:37] almost done and you like you could have
[02:49:39] swirled Hydro from your burst before
[02:49:40] doing your charge attack so you missed
[02:49:42] out on some damage there finina it's
[02:49:45] fine I don't know if you need to burst
[02:49:46] but it's fine SW the hydro oh don't
[02:49:49] burst like see like you're using long
[02:49:51] animations when there's like 3 seconds
[02:49:52] on the timer left normally it's good to
[02:49:54] do that though but yeah it's fine but
[02:49:57] you definitely could have three star
[02:49:58] this like you definitely could have
[02:49:59] there just a bit of mistakes fine it's
[02:50:01] not that
[02:50:03] bad uh sure hp's
[02:50:09] good
[02:50:12] gotta yeah that actually wasn't yia's
[02:50:15] fault like your first half was fine I
[02:50:17] think your second half you played it not
[02:50:19] the best um here you don't need a full
[02:50:22] rotation I mean maybe with Yia edit that
[02:50:24] out edit that out please please I like
[02:50:26] Yia please okay no but like Mago keni he
[02:50:29] splits like or not splits but he goes
[02:50:30] immune after taking a little bit of
[02:50:31] damage like around where my mouse is so
[02:50:33] your first rotation doesn't need to be
[02:50:35] perfect so if you don't have yolon burst
[02:50:37] yes you want a final particles to her
[02:50:38] but you could probably get through that
[02:50:40] first chunk just with like let's say
[02:50:42] jangi yunen y you just use those chip
[02:50:45] him from like that whatever 20% HP or
[02:50:47] however much it is then he'll go immune
[02:50:49] he'll do his like sword attack and then
[02:50:50] you can go yolan yolon burst do your
[02:50:52] whole like get your second rotation
[02:50:53] ready for when he's not immune anymore
[02:50:55] you don't have to like like here you're
[02:50:57] just like waiting right up so you wasted
[02:50:59] like a bit of time when you could have
[02:51:01] done at like a half
[02:51:02] rotation quietly
[02:51:05] now
[02:51:07] stabiliz like look you're doing a full
[02:51:09] rotation which which is fine but like
[02:51:12] look at look you did like maybe like
[02:51:14] okay one normal attack string and now
[02:51:15] he's immune already okay it's a bit more
[02:51:17] HP than I thought I'm stupid but like
[02:51:18] yeah like 30% or something no not yeah
[02:51:20] about 30 and like he's immune now so
[02:51:22] this whole rest of your rotation is like
[02:51:24] you don't need it to he's still
[02:51:27] immune
[02:51:29] solidify I mean outside of that I mean
[02:51:31] this I think you know what you're doing
[02:51:33] I I don't need
[02:51:35] to three
[02:51:44] stars what the [ __ ] happened here
[02:51:49] let
[02:51:54] my I assume you're going to net e and
[02:51:56] then get interrupted
[02:51:58] immediately that's my guess you charge
[02:51:59] that and get interrupted
[02:52:02] immediately oh maybe not Shadow
[02:52:12] Raven honestly yeah honestly I
[02:52:17] think you don't need a shield on J Le
[02:52:20] but I think a shield would help you cuz
[02:52:21] like you're I feel like your only
[02:52:22] problem is you keep getting knocked
[02:52:23] around everywhere like dodging is hard
[02:52:25] on mobile that's fine but you could just
[02:52:26] put your jongi on on this team or like
[02:52:29] even like a like a another shielder if
[02:52:31] you have
[02:52:37] one
[02:52:38] no I would probably run jly on this team
[02:52:42] but like your your clear is pretty good
[02:52:43] still just going optimize it like you
[02:52:45] definitely get 36
[02:52:46] Stars wasn't bad
[02:52:52] what the [ __ ] is this yoia bro what are
[02:52:54] you this might be the best yoia bro what
[02:52:57] are you feeding her this is a and she
[02:53:01] C2 wait no wonder okay you're I was like
[02:53:04] dude your is hitting pretty [ __ ]
[02:53:07] okay Aqua simak Yan that's fine four
[02:53:09] emblem yep yep HP wait do you have
[02:53:14] enough ER I guess you see1 wait you have
[02:53:15] like literally zero ER I at least you're
[02:53:18] C1 but out like no wonder at the magu
[02:53:21] keni you had no burst look with C1 it's
[02:53:24] it's fine but yeah you're definitely
[02:53:26] really low
[02:53:27] are for a solo Hydro team at least you
[02:53:30] had Fab on Jong Le which helps
[02:53:33] but like I think like okay let me look
[02:53:35] at your magu when you're fighting the
[02:53:37] magu I don't think you got your burst
[02:53:38] after like both your e right if you had
[02:53:41] more ER you definitely get burst
[02:53:45] here ga
[02:53:48] gotcha e and then e bust
[02:53:53] yeah that's
[02:53:57] fine engulfing Eugen is pretty
[02:54:00] funny but I mean it's fine unit build is
[02:54:05] just defense ER whatever
[02:54:10] sure okay strong Le show me your Jang Le
[02:54:13] Jang Le should be on okay honestly m is
[02:54:16] good cuz Y is attack scaling but if like
[02:54:19] if you can Petra is also not bad cuz if
[02:54:21] you pick up a hydr crystal you buff your
[02:54:23] if you pick up a pyro Crystal you buff
[02:54:24] your yoia but like mil is fine fa yeah
[02:54:27] that's good MTH yeah
[02:54:32] sure
[02:54:36] sure show me your
[02:54:43] neet Amber
[02:54:45] R5 that's good that's fine yep that's
[02:54:49] really good actually that's also really
[02:54:51] good that's [ __ ] insane [ __ ] you I'm
[02:54:53] mad at you now I'm actually mad I was
[02:54:55] neutral now I'm mad at you okay your
[02:54:56] builds are really good your builds are
[02:54:58] actually really good you just uh like a
[02:55:00] little bit you could have played a
[02:55:01] little bit better you would have gotten
[02:55:03] it good account
[02:55:06] though
[02:55:10] um
[02:55:12] hppd 28
[02:55:15] Stars I almost had a heart attack okay
[02:55:18] okay don't have a heart attack let me
[02:55:20] click on your YouTube video that's okay
[02:55:22] uh what are are you 57 so not like you
[02:55:24] know it you know not like a ar60 so you
[02:55:28] know I don't know what I'm trying to say
[02:55:30] with a sentence okay you got a crit card
[02:55:32] that's really good arlino Bennett Kazo
[02:55:34] Lila okay I love this team but there's
[02:55:37] one sneak I'm not going to say who I'm
[02:55:39] not before you get mad at me I have an
[02:55:41] aunt named Lila okay so I love her very
[02:55:43] dearly I'm just saying there's one sneak
[02:55:45] in this team that doesn't fully make
[02:55:46] sense to me
[02:55:48] and it's not
[02:55:51] Kaza uh me personally here I would like
[02:55:54] I like Leila but I wouldn't use her here
[02:55:55] I would use either another like it
[02:55:57] depends what you want to do if you want
[02:55:58] to do like Vape you could play like a
[02:55:59] SRO a yolon apparently C6 Candace works
[02:56:02] but I haven't tried it if you want to
[02:56:04] play mono pyro you can you can put like
[02:56:06] Shang Ling there that's cool what's
[02:56:08] wrong with a shield it
[02:56:13] just it just doesn't do
[02:56:15] much here
[02:56:19] like Leila's fine but like you already
[02:56:22] have a heal I mean I guess I guess
[02:56:24] you're playing arlino you can't really
[02:56:27] get healed so you might want a shield I
[02:56:29] get it I get it but I get it but it's
[02:56:34] like you're not melting
[02:56:36] like you're not like she'll give you
[02:56:38] like one melt unless I mean okay you
[02:56:41] might be Kos swirling cryo I mean even
[02:56:43] okay let's see actually you might Kos
[02:56:45] roll cryo but I
[02:56:52] okay yeah you're not
[02:57:00] melting yeah I also think people very
[02:57:03] like
[02:57:04] okay I think not to be a SRO Glazer but
[02:57:07] people really underestimate his his like
[02:57:10] in his uh damage
[02:57:12] reduction his defensive utility is
[02:57:14] really useful for arino if you don't
[02:57:16] have a shield so like I like running a
[02:57:18] ker with her and if you want to sure but
[02:57:19] in this team if you're lacking damage I
[02:57:21] don't know if you are but like because
[02:57:23] you didn't full clear with stars I
[02:57:25] assume you are sing TR would like
[02:57:28] Skyrocket your damage
[02:57:30] here but let's
[02:57:33] see zff take that is a zff take but I
[02:57:36] mean it's true like it is
[02:57:41] true like I'm less of a SRO salesman
[02:57:44] than ZF cuz like you know I'm I under
[02:57:47] like I really like Yan and and finina a
[02:57:49] lot too and I think defensive utility is
[02:57:51] nice but a lot of times just reset if
[02:57:53] you suck but for someone like arino it
[02:57:55] helps a lot to have
[02:57:58] utility I don't know I like Lea like I
[02:58:00] think Lila's a good shielder I just
[02:58:01] don't think like unless you're like I
[02:58:03] don't know doing some cryos swirl [ __ ]
[02:58:06] or like double like unless you can
[02:58:08] melt then you're not gaining much damage
[02:58:10] outside like maybe tenacity the MTH
[02:58:13] versus like I don't know like a jang Le
[02:58:16] or like a Singo
[02:58:18] or a Shang Ling but Shang Ling doesn't
[02:58:20] give you
[02:58:22] defense you should bened Al by the way
[02:58:25] like your bened Al is up you'll get a
[02:58:26] lot more damage if you B at Al you
[02:58:28] should b a burst you still should b a
[02:58:30] burst it's not too late okay well I Okay
[02:58:33] I lied it is too
[02:58:35] late it's
[02:58:41] fine okay open up a rotation with burst
[02:58:48] you got the Pyro swirl Bennett okay
[02:58:50] that's
[02:58:52] fine kill the creatures first kill yep
[02:58:56] now go kill the bird I mean this is fine
[02:58:58] but you need to kill the bird you want
[02:58:59] to be aoeing
[02:59:01] [Music]
[02:59:07] them okay two things one even with this
[02:59:10] team you could clear here you just need
[02:59:12] to like group them better and kill that
[02:59:13] bird second of all am I mistaken or do
[02:59:15] you burst on arino like whenever you
[02:59:18] have it almost like every rotation cuz I
[02:59:20] feel like I've seen you burst like three
[02:59:24] times yeah you don't need to burst okay
[02:59:27] I have a guide on this arino burst one
[02:59:29] of the prettiest animations in the game
[02:59:30] okay it looks great it looks great okay
[02:59:32] she snaps she [ __ ] let me let me play
[02:59:34] that back
[02:59:37] again she snaps boom okay but like it
[02:59:40] did 40K damage do you know what else
[02:59:42] does 40K damage in that time one AR Lino
[02:59:44] normal attack with Bond of life so it's
[02:59:46] cool if you need to heal but if you
[02:59:48] don't need to heal it's like a panic
[02:59:49] button if you don't need to heal you
[02:59:51] don't need to do it and also with a
[02:59:53] proper rotation your skill will be back
[02:59:55] up at the end and you'll have a bit of
[02:59:56] bond of life left over so it's actually
[02:59:58] higher damage to keep that Bond of life
[03:00:00] for your next rotation than to lose it
[03:00:01] all when you
[03:00:06] burst but yeah okay all like outside of
[03:00:09] that though you you did like kind of
[03:00:10] fine like you didn't do bad so it's fine
[03:00:13] right like 823 you could have cleared
[03:00:14] faster
[03:00:15] though yeah skill cool down goes down
[03:00:17] when you know so like usually you have
[03:00:19] it at the end of your rotation what the
[03:00:21] wait this is Navia hyper blo wait okay I
[03:00:25] mean okay you have Nita Ryden finina
[03:00:28] Navia now as a Navia lover and also a
[03:00:32] hyper Bloom lover I will say personally
[03:00:35] I either run a Navia carry team or a
[03:00:37] hyper blo team but I mean sure also
[03:00:40] you're running finina with no healer I
[03:00:41] didn't even notice never mind abort okay
[03:00:45] two things one you don't have enough
[03:00:46] Hydro for double power
[03:00:48] two like yeah cuz it's just finina a bit
[03:00:51] Electro from Ryden second of all you
[03:00:53] don't have a Healer so finina is not
[03:00:54] really giving
[03:00:56] you much unless it's protype Amber Nita
[03:01:00] but that's not enough solo kie would
[03:01:02] just be better
[03:01:04] [Music]
[03:01:10] [Music]
[03:01:13] here
[03:01:15] um wow this is
[03:01:27] I mean wait what the [ __ ] happened to
[03:01:29] your wait did your e just not do damage
[03:01:31] I mean I guess you're high pinging so
[03:01:32] maybe it like took a while
[03:01:34] but oh it didn't crate at the
[03:01:39] [Music]
[03:01:42] 20K okay this half is definitely your
[03:01:44] problem
[03:01:50] wait a
[03:01:51] [Music]
[03:01:54] second feel like your hyper should be
[03:01:56] doing more than 16 and 19k how much em
[03:02:00] does your ryen
[03:02:12] have at least your grouping's
[03:02:15] good okay let me check your builds I'm
[03:02:17] sorry let me check your builds I'm sorry
[03:02:23] uh this is crazy oh sh I need to get on
[03:02:26] Star rail soon oh
[03:02:31] [ __ ] okay wait let me let me start with
[03:02:33] your Ren okay is she on em cuz I feel
[03:02:36] like you weren't hyper bling that much I
[03:02:37] mean maybe she is
[03:02:41] maybe we have
[03:02:43] 852 dragon's ban you should level I mean
[03:02:46] honestly it's two wanders okay uh you
[03:02:49] probably should be on a four set or
[03:02:51] twopiece twopiece but it's
[03:02:56] okay honestly better than I expected
[03:02:58] your Red's
[03:02:59] fine uh I would recommend having more
[03:03:02] like ideally you run two be two piece at
[03:03:04] least two piece gilded or two piece of
[03:03:05] any em set or four piece obviously but
[03:03:07] if you don't have four gilded or four
[03:03:09] flop you could do two piece twopiece
[03:03:10] what's your n heat on do you have deut
[03:03:12] you should you have to have oh my God
[03:03:14] you're not
[03:03:16] on just the put deot on
[03:03:24] okay also Chad is telling me your riding
[03:03:26] was on Electro goblet I didn't even see
[03:03:28] that and that's a problem in it of
[03:03:30] itself but first let's address the
[03:03:31] elephant in the room not only do you
[03:03:33] need deepwood for your Nita's damage but
[03:03:35] especially for [ __ ] hyper blo hyper
[03:03:37] blo is a dendral reaction it does
[03:03:39] dendral damage you will need deepwood
[03:03:41] okay I don't care if your substats are
[03:03:42] worse you go deepwood here
[03:03:48] yeah okay that that's your
[03:03:49] problem definitely want deepwood here uh
[03:03:53] who knows maybe you'll be able to strong
[03:03:54] box deepwood with that land who knows
[03:03:56] who knows I don't know but yeah
[03:03:58] definitely get deepwood okay uh
[03:04:00] definitely get deepwood it's definitely
[03:04:01] worth it and honestly like don't don't
[03:04:04] hate me for saying the truth but like a
[03:04:07] viable alternative here is just don't
[03:04:09] run Navia hyper blo like you could just
[03:04:10] run Navia like double Hydro for the Pyro
[03:04:12] electors with like Bennett or something
[03:04:14] boom you have a decent team or run hyper
[03:04:16] Bloom but without Navia like there's a
[03:04:17] few few things you could do but please
[03:04:18] go deep with okay
[03:04:21] sorry people are saying attack circlet
[03:04:23] I'm not concerned with your gilded set
[03:04:24] because you're going to switch a
[03:04:25] deepwood one so it's fine right okay
[03:04:28] cool right okay sure let's look at
[03:04:30] someone else arino what's your arino on
[03:04:32] glad that's good glad is good that's a
[03:04:35] really good flower really good feather
[03:04:37] okay solid arino unless your last piece
[03:04:40] is like the worst thing ever yeah that's
[03:04:44] good your aro's good so your first was
[03:04:48] honestly fine you just need to play a
[03:04:49] bit better and maybe swap one
[03:04:55] character
[03:05:00] yeah
[03:05:06] yeah why is Electro damage bad Electro
[03:05:08] damage is good for normal Ryden for
[03:05:10] hyper Blom riding you go full em also
[03:05:18] your Ryden is not leveled listen okay
[03:05:21] you don't need to level every character
[03:05:23] but if you're hyper blooming this is a I
[03:05:25] feel like this is what I've said for
[03:05:26] every clip so far for some reason no
[03:05:28] one's Electro characters are Level n
[03:05:30] okay if you're hyper blooming level your
[03:05:32] Electro or whoever's triggering it to 90
[03:05:34] same with Bloom same with virgon
[03:05:37] aggravate as well but especially like
[03:05:39] any Bloom reaction you level your
[03:05:41] character to 90 you lose like [ __ ]
[03:05:42] over 30% damage if you're not 90 it's
[03:05:45] really big
[03:05:55] yeah so that's that's why your hyper
[03:05:57] Loom was doing nothing like if Ryan's 90
[03:05:59] and Nikita's on deep you're almost
[03:06:01] doubling your damage like your hyper
[03:06:02] Loom should not do 16k they should
[03:06:04] definitely do more hello and yes I would
[03:06:07] run Kookie there to have a Healer for
[03:06:08] your finina or more probably more Hydro
[03:06:10] as well cuz your uh there's double py
[03:06:12] lectors in this Abyss so maybe the next
[03:06:14] Abyss it'll be fine but especially if
[03:06:16] there's two Hydro like you need quite a
[03:06:19] bit of hydro or like a taser team or
[03:06:20] something Soldier Liz
[03:06:24] your minus one HSR event okay we ah [ __ ]
[03:06:31] do I have to go do it now I'm having fun
[03:06:32] doing this okay let me do a little bit
[03:06:34] let me do like two more accounts maybe
[03:06:36] we'll do a part three of this
[03:06:38] Steph pyro yunen not an abyss clear but
[03:06:42] we're this is a Discord I'm not
[03:06:44] downloading a Discord video
[03:06:50] I don't know what I'm doing wrong 33 is
[03:06:51] the highest amount of stars arlino
[03:06:54] nevet okay first of all you're running
[03:06:56] Nikita em Ryden and S CH with arino
[03:06:58] brother just just just
[03:07:01] like the EM okay the hyper Bloom core is
[03:07:04] good on its own and it's good to make a
[03:07:06] bad character good but if you're taking
[03:07:08] a good character like they don't you
[03:07:10] don't need to put that with them you can
[03:07:11] just play a good team with a good
[03:07:13] character let's look though
[03:07:36] look okay
[03:07:39] uh this is lagging a little illusion
[03:07:42] shattered witness the power of no my uh
[03:07:51] so you are currently playing burning
[03:07:52] arino just so you
[03:07:54] know which I mean it's a
[03:08:02] choice okay this is going to sound toxic
[03:08:05] but I think if your team had only arlino
[03:08:07] SRO and no other characters You' you
[03:08:09] would you would have cleared that faster
[03:08:12] R cutter
[03:08:17] There Is No
[03:08:25] Escape like you're not vaping at
[03:08:30] all share my
[03:08:34] knowled witness the power
[03:08:37] of
[03:08:43] okay yeah I really don't like your team
[03:08:45] what's your second one
[03:08:47] second team's good this is a good team
[03:08:50] bow your you have seven minutes left
[03:08:55] though so I think it might be a first
[03:08:57] team
[03:08:58] problem swirl Hydro here can also
[03:09:01] official o
[03:09:03] but you got
[03:09:06] pyro okay this is hurting my eyes yeah
[03:09:10] your first team definitely could be
[03:09:11] better uh that's my
[03:09:15] recommendation but I mean you could have
[03:09:18] figured that one
[03:09:20] out where the [ __ ] is Zio archives [ __ ]
[03:09:23] is your name
[03:09:28] thermical I'm free to play wait didn't I
[03:09:30] already see this I saw you say you're

[03:09:53] a what Abyss rotation is this yeah you
[03:09:56] were in the wrong [ __ ] stream you're
[03:09:57] in the wrong [ __ ] stream think I'm
[03:09:59] pulling for a Healer like I don't care
[03:10:01] if it's meta I don't care if if if
[03:10:03] anyone tells you to do it and you think
[03:10:05] you got me [ __ ] up if you think I'm
[03:10:06] pulling for yeah what
[03:10:09] youut kind of
[03:10:11] cute you got me [ __ ] up here
[03:10:18] okay we probably give this to Bao then
[03:10:19] cuz L
[03:10:22] uh and this is a [ __ ] ton of healing so
[03:10:24] we'll probably give this to like dude

[03:16:40] flute Covenant of the deep a brush
[03:16:44] maneuver you're literally not even
[03:16:45] swapping to allies
[03:16:48] [Music]
[03:16:59] them I see everything I mean here you
[03:17:01] you're probably going to use them right
[03:17:03] although to be fair you don't have much
[03:17:04] Hydro out outside of K like it's just
[03:17:06] kokomi so feel like if you you're
[03:17:09] playing out hyam here you probably want
[03:17:10] faster Hydro I mean okay one mirror
[03:17:13] gaming no that was two mirrors actually
[03:17:15] I lied
[03:17:18] wait are you even going to get this the
[03:17:20] [ __ ] is
[03:17:22] happening yeah you got it you got
[03:17:25] it this might be the worst Alm gameplay
[03:17:28] of all time but that was good you got it
[03:17:31] let's watch the show again stabilized
[03:17:33] truth repeats its course everybody stand
[03:17:38] back
[03:17:40] lament okay no flame but the way you
[03:17:42] move your camera is making me
[03:17:45] dizzy no flame though no flame nice
[03:17:49] Dodge by jumping
[03:17:54] up okay you said don't make fun of that
[03:17:56] one plunge but I've seen you miss like
[03:17:57] six so like I'm not trying to Flame you
[03:17:59] but which one am I not allowed to make
[03:18:01] fun of just so I know like which of the
[03:18:02] other ones I can make fun of sorry sorry
[03:18:05] I'm sorry
[03:18:07] dream you do the same I do I I I
[03:18:11] do but I make fun of myself so it's it's
[03:18:14] okay
[03:18:19] Pro tip if you're playing sh you can get
[03:18:20] a free normal attack in between your
[03:18:22] plunges if you just uh normal cancel
[03:18:25] like if you do I [ __ ] CH my team I
[03:18:29] mean it doesn't matter though cuz a lot
[03:18:30] of the
[03:18:32] times if you're bad at it you like lose
[03:18:34] out on a plunge so it's not worth it but
[03:18:36] it's like it's zero frames I'm pretty
[03:18:37] sure like it's just like you don't lose
[03:18:39] any time by doing a normal between your
[03:18:43] jumps versus like like this is jumping
[03:18:45] normally and then
[03:18:47] like I [ __ ] it
[03:18:50] up but anyways doesn't matter doesn't
[03:18:53] matter good clear
[03:18:54] though no one does that sorry I
[03:19:01] do anyways I mean this is a good clear
[03:19:04] okay one more last one and then we do
[03:19:05] our thing we're going to do more I
[03:19:06] honestly might do a part three cuz this
[03:19:08] is fun so I might do more next stream
[03:19:10] but I have to do the like the week's
[03:19:12] about to reset and I didn't do the star
[03:19:13] event and it's about to end and I was

[03:21:26] you don't know any better it's fine I'm
[03:21:28] just saying I'm
[03:21:30] sad you did consent to get roasted that
[03:21:33] was in the the TOs of this form
[03:21:36] so this is why I'm making a new Shang
[03:21:39] Ling guide oh you're going to get it
[03:21:42] please
[03:21:44] yes look at how much more damage you're
[03:21:46] going to do turn to
[03:21:48] Oblivion okay I mean your Shang is not
[03:21:50] critting at all by the
[03:21:52] way I mean okay you started critting now
[03:21:55] never
[03:21:56] mind okay 10ks though is really small I
[03:21:58] don't know what your what is your Shang
[03:22:01] Ling should not be doing 10K in in
[03:22:03] international or like rational
[03:22:06] team she should not be doing 10ks
[03:22:09] illusion SH now You Shall Perish
[03:22:16] wait let me look at your Shang Ling
[03:22:17] build What's Happening
[03:22:24] Here Shang
[03:22:27] Ling I don't want to spoil I almost saw
[03:22:29] the crit ratio I don't want to spoil it
[03:22:31] level 11 Pyon you have
[03:22:34] 100
[03:22:40] brother Shang Ling does a considerable
[03:22:43] amount of that team's damage okay it's
[03:22:45] not just Ren please build
[03:22:49] her R3 F your Fab's not even level 90
[03:22:52] which is a big deal you could also go
[03:22:54] the catch for personal damage but if
[03:22:55] your team needs er uh Fab is fine but I
[03:22:58] don't like running fa I like Fab Shang
[03:22:59] Ling in some teams not in that team in
[03:23:01] that team I like going for a damage
[03:23:02] weapon cuz she is a
[03:23:05] carry that's a good flower honestly
[03:23:07] attack like this is fine okay that's a
[03:23:10] decent
[03:23:11] feather that is maybe the worst Sans
[03:23:13] like okay em attack is fine but you have
[03:23:15] like no crit value 777 HP it's offset 2
[03:23:18] there's no way that's your best
[03:23:20] one that's honestly good that's a good
[03:23:23] goblet that is average it's not bad it's
[03:23:27] not bad
[03:23:29] C4
[03:23:31] yeah
[03:23:33] yeah definitely could uh wait was that
[03:23:35] an em
[03:23:36] ciret wait I'm
[03:23:39] sorry I didn't even look at the main
[03:23:41] stat that's em never mind never mind no
[03:23:44] wonder you have no [ __ ] crit I was
[03:23:45] like I I was literally thinking in my
[03:23:47] head like your stats look decent why do
[03:23:49] you have no like why is your ratio 30
[03:23:52] 100 it's cuz you have a no crit circit
[03:23:54] you're also running a weapon that gives
[03:23:55] you no crit I mean fav isn't bad but
[03:23:58] with 30 crit rate fav is is not I don't
[03:24:00] please don't go
[03:24:02] fav like okay F isn't bad but catch
[03:24:04] would just be better in that team if
[03:24:05] your catch is on Ryden
[03:24:08] sure but uh you definitely don't want an
[03:24:10] amm ciret please go crit cirit like crit
[03:24:12] damage here or crit raid no either's
[03:24:14] fine depends on your ratio crit you
[03:24:15] probably need more crit ra
[03:24:18] but yeah okay that's definitely the
[03:24:25] problem yeah you're running faulon Ryden
[03:24:29] and Bennett you don't need uh definitely
[03:24:34] relatable like I don't think you need fa
[03:24:37] Shang
[03:24:42] Ling what's your riding on
[03:24:50] the catch yeah if your Ryden on your
[03:24:52] Ryden can go Fab but you could also do
[03:24:55] catch Ryden and contain cross spear
[03:24:57] Shang Ling I don't know what weapons you
[03:24:59] have I'm not going to Flame your weapon
[03:25:00] Choice like it might be fine but you
[03:25:02] definitely want more crit values like
[03:25:04] your circet is not
[03:25:07] okay
[03:25:10] anyways also yeah like if you don't have
[03:25:12] good emblem you you could go offset well
[03:25:15] no you're on 200 ER you really want
[03:25:17] emblem to be
[03:25:19] fair but
[03:25:24] yeah HP circuit wait is that triple HP
[03:25:28] or is your Sans if your Sans is er I'll
[03:25:31] give you a pass if you're on Triple HP
[03:25:32] you're on Triple HP okay you lost the
[03:25:37] pass okay I need a
[03:25:40] break wait what's your Fin's crit like I
[03:25:42] feel like you have like 20 crit
[03:25:45] rate wait what are your finina
[03:25:48] stats
[03:25:50] brother look crit isn't everything okay
[03:25:52] I'll be the first to tell you valuable
[03:25:54] substats like energy recharge you have
[03:25:55] you have none either where are your
[03:25:57] stats wait you have no ER and no crit
[03:25:59] what are you what wa what is happening
[03:26:01] oh my God you're full HP oh my God this
[03:26:04] isn't Kirara this isn't Neu man you
[03:26:08] need I'm sorry I don't want to yell at
[03:26:11] you uh a good balance between HP ER and
[03:26:14] crit is is nice for freeno okay full HP
[03:26:17] is not ideal HP Sands great goblet sure
[03:26:21] HP goblet and hydro are both viable
[03:26:22] Hydro is typically a bit sorry HP is
[03:26:24] typically a bit better but but ciret
[03:26:27] triple HP is not recommended HP
[03:26:30] sword if you're already running triple
[03:26:32] HP way
[03:26:34] Overkill I would recommend going uh for
[03:26:37] the font fishable sword that gives you a
[03:26:38] ton of er like the pipe if you don't
[03:26:41] have F ring Des higher also level your
[03:26:42] to is higher than six you have like 17
[03:26:45] million more
[03:26:47] please level your talents higher than 66
[03:26:49] you want to be at least like 99 your
[03:26:50] Jong Le is 151 were you born yesterday
[03:26:54] is this account brand
[03:27:01] newth wait a
[03:27:03] second no flame okay no flame but you're
[03:27:07] you're you're telling me your black
[03:27:09] tassle is level 90 but like all your
[03:27:10] other weapons are like 70 or 80 this is
[03:27:13] probably the least important weapon to
[03:27:14] level in your whole team
[03:27:18] let me look at other let me look at your
[03:27:22] nevet 37k HP okay your Nev's actually
[03:27:25] good what the
[03:27:27] [ __ ] wait okay what your Nev's
[03:27:32] good HP Hydro
[03:27:36] okay this might be the worst ofet Goblin
[03:27:38] of all
[03:27:40] time uh look attack on hydro is good but
[03:27:43] not for nevet okay it'd be good for like
[03:27:45] child right sing I mean there's no crit
[03:27:47] so it wouldn't even be that good but
[03:27:49] yeah this is not great for nevet but I
[03:27:51] mean you know you don't have that many
[03:27:53] artifacts so it's
[03:27:54] fine main stat is more important than
[03:27:56] sub stats I get it but honestly your
[03:27:59] nevet is definitely your your best
[03:28:01] character your rests are kind
[03:28:07] of
[03:28:10] yeah what about who else is not leveled
[03:28:12] wait is your Ryden level what's your
[03:28:14] Ryden ratio
[03:28:17] not bad you could use a bit more crit
[03:28:18] damage though cuz you're on the catch
[03:28:19] right so you have way more crit rate
[03:28:21] than like you have not enough crit
[03:28:23] damage for your amount of crit
[03:28:24] rate but uh what the okay sorry I'm
[03:28:33] I'm this is an insane Flower by the way
[03:28:35] I just I got a I don't know what
[03:28:37] happened I thought this was a HP circlet
[03:28:39] I almost maled but yeah really good
[03:28:42] flower this would be a lot better on
[03:28:45] strangling like the EM here is not I
[03:28:48] mean it's yeah this is like kind of mid
[03:28:51] I would give this to Shang Ling but it's
[03:28:52] fine sure this is pretty good you're on
[03:28:56] five emblem too you can run off
[03:28:58] past uh attack go I don't like double
[03:29:01] attack wa is your sand yeah like attack
[03:29:03] if you're doing attack sand and attack
[03:29:04] Alit usually one of the two I don't do
[03:29:06] attack but like it's it's fine you're
