[00:18:15] [ __ ] how how long it lasts and like
[00:18:16] well it lasts 10 minutes so it's
[00:18:17] basically infinite but like how big it
[00:18:20] is which is 200% I don't know whatever
[00:18:22] it's

[00:19:23] that's foul I mean it's
[00:19:26] true but anyways
[00:19:31] maybe Shang Ling's The House of the
[00:19:32] Hearth you think like Shang Ling's just
[00:19:35] everything what if Shang Ling's a foule
[00:19:38] what if guoba
[00:19:40] is I don't know I don't know what I'm
[00:19:42] cooking great four stars though no this
[00:19:45] is disgusting this is a terrible Banner
[00:19:47] but we'll talk about that after I'm done
[00:19:48] everything but the Banners are [ __ ]
[00:19:49] garbage I was literally on call with the
[00:19:52] Jeff I remember it came out we were
[00:19:55] talking I was like dude I get like it's
[00:19:57] gonna be Chev Lenny uh Lynette and and F
[00:20:01] I was like it has to be that and then
[00:20:03] randomly I was like mid TFT game
[00:20:05] randomly [ __ ] Banner drops I check my
[00:20:08] phone it's Shang
[00:20:11] Ling like look
[00:20:14] why like
[00:20:16] why like how is Shang Ling here what
[00:20:19] does she have to do with any of them
[00:20:21] nothing to settle in fette like okay no
[00:20:25] like like like like dude okay I get it
[00:20:26] she's probably the best character on
[00:20:28] both of these banners and the next two
[00:20:30] in the next patch true okay but like
[00:20:34] like like like like what does she have
[00:20:35] to do with
[00:20:40] them anyways why do you hate Shang Ling
[00:20:43] dude I love Shang Ling it's just always
[00:20:45] strangling it's always strangling do you
[00:20:48] know what else is on every [ __ ]
[00:20:49] Banner dragon's Bane dude I am sick of
[00:20:53] dragon's Bane it's on every Banner if I
[00:20:57] take a shot every time dragon V is on a
[00:20:59] banner I die of alcohol
[00:21:08] poisoning and like Z like I was talking
[00:21:11] to zachi like this is a pretty good
[00:21:12] Banner for like newer players right you
[00:21:14] can get Lynette Shang Lin cons but like
[00:21:16] you and then I'm like dude you get
[00:21:17] Lynette for free he's like oh I forgot
[00:21:19] you get Lynette for free fem is half a
[00:21:22] character sorry no disrespect to the fem
[00:21:23] and Main the one that's left I'm sorry
[00:21:26] actually no disrespect and then Shang
[00:21:27] Ling's broken but like you probably have
[00:21:29] 20 of her and if you're new cuz arino
[00:21:32] attracts you to the game Shang Ling cons
[00:21:34] are good but like even then you'd rather
[00:21:36] have like a a new character that's good
[00:21:38] for you like Singo or like kie or some
[00:21:40] [ __ ] official but like whatever like

[00:22:19] Chevy why do you mention uh Chev with
[00:22:22] arino huh do you know something we don't
[00:22:25] why would you mention her
[00:22:28] I don't
[00:22:29] know but wouldn't it be funny if you
[00:22:31] know she was good I don't know it' be
[00:22:38] funny oh yeah Chevy might go with clind
[00:22:41] actually that that's a fair point cuz I
[00:22:43] mean they might Electro DPS new okay I'm
[00:22:45] about to get stun locked I saw so much
[00:22:48] like kaching slander randomly it
[00:22:51] actually made me angry do people not
[00:22:53] know King's good like like is like
[00:22:56] casual genin like do casual genin
[00:22:58] players to like super conduct kaching it
[00:23:00] actually pissed me off like I rarely get
[00:23:03] one guide but dude I got I saw like
[00:23:05] eight tweets about like oh oh like oh oh
[00:23:09] kaching is so bad oh my God Claren is
[00:23:11] going to be so much better maybe maybe
[00:23:13] but kaching is not even
[00:23:16] bad dude like okay not the don't go
[00:23:19] harass this person okay not the single
[00:23:22] one out cuz I saw like eight tweets but
[00:23:24] I had to keep this open kaching does no
[00:23:26] damage Ryden needs C6 Sara yeah M
[00:23:28] doesn't even go on field and Soo is
[00:23:30] worse than kaching choren saw the need
[00:23:32] for a real main dude you are like all of
[00:23:35] this is wrong literally every word here
[00:23:38] is
[00:23:39] wrong every word here is wrong it like
[00:23:42] pissed me off dude there's no
[00:23:45] way okay yes in a kaching aggravate team
[00:23:48] fal's doing like more damage but like
[00:23:51] that's the same like okay not true cuz
[00:23:53] AOE but like fal's broken it's a joke
[00:23:56] maybe that's why I said be nice to them
[00:23:57] I don't care but I've seen like unironic
[00:24:00] posts of this it is the overworking I
[00:24:02] just added this emote I just added this
[00:24:05] emote
[00:24:10] orange Soo is worse than kaching yes but
[00:24:13] the people that say Soo is a worse
[00:24:14] kaching don't understand how to play Soo
[00:24:16] because you play him in [ __ ] quick
[00:24:17] Bloom where he has a completely
[00:24:18] different role than
[00:24:19] kaching is kaching still a better unit
[00:24:21] overall generally yeah cuz you go like
[00:24:23] aggravate but like it's a different uh
[00:24:26] sinos like more for quick Bloom and I
[00:24:29] would say he's better in quick
[00:24:34] Bloom
[00:24:41] anyways anyways kaching slander did a h
[00:24:45] a hurt my core it wasn't just that it it
[00:24:48] was a it was a plethora of of of one
[00:24:51] guys anyways um we're going to start
[00:24:54] here okay I guess I yapped for long
[00:24:56] enough so I guess I'm forced to finish
[00:24:58] talking about the banners let me finish
[00:24:59] talking about the banners um first of
[00:25:01] all looking second of all uh Linny cool
[00:25:05] uh weapon Banner is what are these four
[00:25:08] stars dude what the [ __ ] is portable saw
[00:25:10] like like who has ever used a portable
[00:25:12] saw don't type me or you're banned like
[00:25:14] what the [ __ ] is a portable saw is it an
[00:25:16] HP main stat the drill one's not bad but
[00:25:19] the [ __ ] prospector drill is I just
[00:25:22] looked up Portable HP
[00:25:31] I just looked up portable
[00:25:33] saw dude okay what is it called
[00:25:39] I oh portable power
[00:25:42] saw it is HP [ __ ] useless garbage
[00:25:45] dude portable saw garbage dragon's bin
[00:25:48] it's been on every Banner if have
[00:25:49] perception garbage F's bow good but you
[00:25:51] get one for free and then HP sword
[00:25:55] really good like that's a good one it's
[00:25:56] good for nuu it's good for kirar there
[00:25:58] aren't many HP swords um zff would argue
[00:26:02] hey if you're going to pull on a weapon
[00:26:04] banner and you want a Neu weapon get key
[00:26:07] cuz it's a bigger increase to your team
[00:26:08] than any other weapon and honestly Fair
[00:26:10] uh I fair but the HP sword is still
[00:26:15] good um lenn's Bow's fine it's good and
[00:26:18] then AR Lino spear is um upsetting I
[00:26:22] actually looked into it cuz arino
[00:26:37] wait where's the like picture of what it
[00:26:41] [Music]
[00:26:44] does yo
[00:26:46] IX first time on your stream nice to
[00:26:50] finally catch you on a stream can you
[00:26:53] say hi Raina to my GF it is okay if you
[00:26:56] don't want to I don't want to don't but
[00:27:02] hello hi okay D okay listen I looked
[00:27:07] into this dude
[00:27:09] okay this is
[00:27:15] literally okay it's a scythe for arino
[00:27:17] so it's [ __ ] sick um but it's like
[00:27:21] literally the least versatile polearm
[00:27:24] right now I assume they're going to add
[00:27:26] Bond of Life supports this isn't like
[00:27:29] sukk it's like I probably cuz why else
[00:27:31] would they make this but if they don't
[00:27:34] it's like the most
[00:27:47] unversaw I'm not even kidding uh but
[00:27:52] yeah
[00:27:55] um it's not that okay so they might
[00:27:58] release someone that's like hey get a
[00:27:59] bond of life if you do this weapon will
[00:28:01] be versatile because you'll get 36%
[00:28:03] damage bonus if not all you're getting
[00:28:06] is Jade spear stats which are good on
[00:28:08] some characters but are bad for
[00:28:10] non-attack scalers because it's a high
[00:28:11] base attack and a lot of times you'd
[00:28:13] rather have crit but it's fine and then
[00:28:15] a passive that's just worse than Jades
[00:28:17] for anyone that's not arino because you
[00:28:19] get 12% damage onon us that's it
[00:28:20] literally just 12% damage nothing else
[00:28:23] Jade spear is damage and
[00:28:26] attack anyways for all the Lino though
[00:28:28] you get another 24% damage and more B uh
[00:28:30] uh uh bond which is you know POG uh but
[00:28:35] there's a chance they release new Bond
[00:28:38] of Life
[00:28:40] [ __ ] probably I mean there's a [ __ ]
[00:28:43] leaker in chat no leaks but like
[00:28:45] probably like
[00:28:48] probably uh I mean I'm not even aware if
[00:28:51] there is a character but I I I don't
[00:28:53] know whatever you guys are are chatting
[00:28:55] so maybe but realistically there's
[00:28:58] probably going to be more uses
[00:28:59] eventually but like right now it's unv
[00:29:00] veratile and then second of all it's
[00:29:02] like even if there's a future character
[00:29:03] that can use it or enable it it's like
[00:29:05] are you going to have to pull for a
[00:29:07] [ __ ] new character that might not
[00:29:08] even be good in your team like let's say
[00:29:10] they release a new character that either
[00:29:12] has Bond of Life as a DPS or is a
[00:29:14] support that gives it to your team right
[00:29:16] am I going to use that maybe dog shed
[00:29:18] character maybe good but maybe dog shed
[00:29:20] character as like my support like it
[00:29:21] might be just bad so it's like probably
[00:29:23] not worth like gambling on that maybe
[00:29:25] they're good I don't know anyways so
[00:29:29] yeah for now it's just an like it's just
[00:29:32] really not versatile which is annoying
[00:29:33] but it's it's cool um and like yeah like
[00:29:38] I would if I wasn't a stre like if I
[00:29:40] let's I was a casual player not a
[00:29:41] streamer I would get this weapon cuz I'm
[00:29:43] like I need a scythe like I would no
[00:29:44] matter what I would even look at C1
[00:29:46] that's not to say it's better because we
[00:29:48] don't know what the [ __ ] C1 does and
[00:29:49] I'll talk about it when I I can like I
[00:29:51] know what it is but like I can't you
[00:29:52] know [ __ ] you but uh yeah so
[00:29:59] yes I'm going to pull for it in fact I
[00:30:00] prearm this [ __ ] this thing's new it's
[00:30:02] going to be [ __ ] ass again but I
[00:30:03] prearm those
[00:30:06] cups anyways porn acting classic no if
[00:30:10] I'm not porn acting I'm telling you what
[00:30:12] I know and what I what I know but like
[00:30:14] usually I don't
[00:30:16] know none of this is porn acting all I
[00:30:19] know is that this is niche as [ __ ] and
[00:30:20] they're probably going to make it less
[00:30:21] Niche but it's still like a gamble like
[00:30:23] I'd much rather have a home on my
[00:30:26] account but it's really like it's good
[00:30:28] for arino which is weird it's like a
[00:30:31] very signature weapon very much
[00:30:33] signature
[00:30:35] weapon which isn't
[00:30:37] bad but like it's not bad like I would
[00:30:40] get it for her because it's a
[00:30:44] scythe
[00:30:46] anyways
[00:30:48] caught
[00:30:51] T oh yeah okay they also drip marketed
[00:30:54] like eight characters while I wasn't
[00:30:55] live which is another reason why I'm
[00:30:57] live
[00:30:59] so first of
[00:31:01] all clar Indi um first of all yapping
[00:31:05] ton City second of all I thought her
[00:31:07] name had an H third of all looking
[00:31:09] fourth of all c a clip of you all I see
[00:31:12] is you drooling over hot
[00:31:17] man this character I remember the
[00:31:20] [ __ ] font 10 like teaser trailer
[00:31:23] dropped when I was like at a dinner
[00:31:25] during twitchcon I remember I wasn't
[00:31:27] home like I could can stream and I look
[00:31:29] I watched all my [ __ ] mobile device I
[00:31:31] was like I'll wait to stream but I was
[00:31:32] like skipping through it Claren was like
[00:31:34] top one or top two most hype I was like
[00:31:36] holy [ __ ] she looks sick so finally
[00:31:38] she's here I don't know why they waited
[00:31:39] for [ __ ]
[00:31:41] 4.26 but she's finally coming
[00:31:49] um yeah so that's cool they announced
[00:31:52] dude we're getting three [ __ ]
[00:31:53] characters next patch hello has this
[00:31:55] ever happened on a 7 point is it 7 I
[00:31:58] think it's 7
[00:32:01] choren Sai weeny and [ __ ]
[00:32:13] SOS so yeah that's pretty hype um choren
[00:32:17] looks sick sein uh she she's cool but
[00:32:20] like I I get too many flashbacks of
[00:32:22] [ __ ] Bou and Chi-Chi
[00:32:24] combined it looks identical to Bou uh um
[00:32:29] I don't know I didn't notice she had a
[00:32:30] [ __ ] gun why the [ __ ] did she she
[00:32:31] have a gun who gave her a
[00:32:37] gun so yeah look at the
[00:32:40] bag wait what is that I'm going to be
[00:32:43] honest I didn't even open this
[00:32:45] tweet oh healer is that a Healer that
[00:32:47] has to be a Healer right there's a
[00:32:48] [ __ ] heart broken and then a heart
[00:32:51] all right probably healer she's a
[00:32:53] [ __ ] nurse right so syringe gun yeah
[00:32:56] that's a [ __ ] healer
[00:32:58] sus dude I don't know what she does I'm
[00:33:02] just okay Bond of Life sus dude I don't
[00:33:06] know but that would actually make sense
[00:33:07] given the weapon that's a good educated
[00:33:09] guess unless you guys aren't guessing
[00:33:11] but I'm saying educated guess- wise that
[00:33:12] makes sense but I don't [ __ ] know so
[00:33:14] stop leak don't don't type leaks anyways
[00:33:17] uh she looks cool I mean she looks
[00:33:19] whatever honestly but maybe cool maybe
[00:33:21] not cool uh choren is definitely cool
[00:33:23] though like even if Chen's bad I'll play
[00:33:25] her uh SIU I'll play if she's good we'll
[00:33:27] see I mean if she's fun whatever sethos
[00:33:29] is cool
[00:33:33] um sethos is cool I like his design I'm
[00:33:37] afraid cuz he's an electro bow and he
[00:33:39] looks like a fourstar so he's probably
[00:33:41] just going to be a worst official but I
[00:33:42] believe in my my boy like hopefully he's
[00:33:44] going to be cool um like dude dude we
[00:33:49] can put him with Soo and then we'll have
[00:33:50] a bench
[00:33:52] team no no I like he looks cool how do
[00:33:54] you know B [ __ ] what do you
[00:33:56] think this is what the [ __ ] do you think
[00:33:59] this is this is Sion of the Blazing
[00:34:07] Sun ew this coffee is like
[00:34:10] grainy got to the end what if he's like
[00:34:13] Sara ew don't [ __ ] don't mention
[00:34:16] don't put Sara and fishell in the same
[00:34:18] sentence anyways he he looks he looks
[00:34:21] cool like I'm actually excited for him
[00:34:23] uh I think gaming is like a good
[00:34:24] fourstar that like I'm happy about
[00:34:26] although I didn't make a guide but he's
[00:34:28] like oh a strong fourar option cool
[00:34:30] hopefully sethos is like that we don't
[00:34:32] know um well we'll see but um I'm very
[00:34:37] excited for chlorin and before chlorin
[00:34:39] comes out fal's good okay uh sorry
[00:34:41] King's good let let's make that clear
[00:34:43] okay cool
[00:34:48] um I don't know why I like I wasn't
[00:34:51] trying
[00:34:53] to oh yeah AR Lino demo that came out

[00:34:58] yeah svore dark donated $1 what is your
[00:35:02] team for alako going to look like dude
[00:35:04] just wait till tomorrow she's out
[00:35:06] tomorrow wi reveal when don't ban me I
[00:35:09] love you King she's out tomorrow every
[00:35:12] pyro character plays the same [ __ ]
[00:35:14] three teams like okay literally every
[00:35:18] pyro character plays the same two like
[00:35:19] two or three teams it's not [ __ ]
[00:35:22] rocket science melt sucks dick buron
[00:35:24] sucks [ __ ] burning isn't a reaction if
[00:35:27] you make mead men the burning set I will
[00:35:28] get mad at you so it's [ __ ] like
[00:35:30] there's like three reactions left not
[00:35:32] even Rea like dude there's like three
[00:35:34] teams that every pyro character can
[00:35:37] play
[00:35:40] anyways we'll get into it we'll get into
[00:35:42] it in the guide and tomorrow please talk
[00:35:44] about the burning set okay I'm not going
[00:35:46] to
[00:35:48] okay guming can melt true
[00:35:53] true but you're using can very
[00:35:56] generously
[00:36:01] but yeah like some shun pyro teams can
[00:36:03] melt because if you're like plunging and
[00:36:06] and gaming always is plunging you're
[00:36:07] like kind of applying pyro uh not as
[00:36:10] fast like with the Luke when I play melt
[00:36:12] Luke like I will override the cryo
[00:36:15] eventually if I'm normal attack e
[00:36:16] spamming but if you're like plunging you
[00:36:18] can kind of your Pyro's slower so yeah
[00:36:21] but it's not a real a lot of times it's
[00:36:23] not real with guming it
[00:36:25] is anyways AR
[00:36:29] lulab I didn't watch
[00:36:32] it check star Twitter dude I
[00:36:38] I I saw it dude I literally I literally
[00:36:43] dude dude dude dude I got [ __ ] where
[00:36:46] is it where is it I got spoiled it's
[00:36:48] fine it's fine it's on me I already knew
[00:36:50] anyways I already knew but bro that's a
[00:36:52] crazy drip marketing dude that's crazy
[00:36:55] why does this guy have Aquilla [ __ ]
[00:36:57] that's not even Aqua I don't know dude
[00:37:00] that's crazy but I knew it I actually
[00:37:01] knew I actually knew I actually knew I
[00:37:03] actually I knew before the quest even
[00:37:04] came out like people were theorizing
[00:37:06] about it from like [ __ ]
[00:37:08] 2.0 so like I knew for like like three
[00:37:11] months it's fine it's fine it's fine it
[00:37:13] just wasn't confirmed in my head now
[00:37:14] it's confirmed but like it like it
[00:37:16] literally was like everyone was yapping
[00:37:18] about it it's fine dude I literally was
[00:37:22] like I I I said like oh I love Sam like
[00:37:25] I love him and then you guys were like
[00:37:26] quotations him him sukk like I like okay
[00:37:29] thanks [ __ ] you chat so like I knew okay
[00:37:32] also at the [ __ ] peny event that I
[00:37:34] went to I made sure not to get spoiled
[00:37:37] but then I was there's like a bit of
[00:37:39] downtime and they had like a TV with
[00:37:41] like a bunch of voice actors and stuff
[00:37:42] cool
[00:37:43] people and they had like a like at some
[00:37:46] point they're like oh we're going to
[00:37:47] play this cut scene and I thought it was
[00:37:48] from like 2.0 so I'm like oh what's
[00:37:50] happening I looked on God no spoilers to
[00:37:52] the quest this is all I know this is the
[00:37:54] only thing I heard I just heard Sam
[00:37:58] like turn back now in [ __ ] Firefly's
[00:38:00] voice and then my whole head was like
[00:38:02] [ __ ] I think I just got spoiled so dude
[00:38:05] like it was that was like a month ago so
[00:38:07] like it is what it is like it is what it
[00:38:08] is okay it is what it
[00:38:10] is it is what it
[00:38:13] is anyways so we'll still do the quest I
[00:38:16] was going to do it today actually I was
[00:38:17] like [ __ ] it I'll just go live and do it
[00:38:19] but I think that's dumb because arino is
[00:38:21] tomorrow and I don't want to be like I
[00:38:22] don't want the guide to be late so I
[00:38:24] can't stream for too long so I'll I'll
[00:38:25] do it like this week no copium no copium
[00:38:28] we'll do it this week no copium
[00:38:31] um how haven't you done it okay here's
[00:38:33] the thing I enjoy quests when I do them
[00:38:36] I've liked almost every genin archon
[00:38:39] Quest everyone that I've streamed
[00:38:40] because I didn't stream the inauma ones
[00:38:42] thank Allah but the star ones too I've
[00:38:45] enjoyed the star rail ones okay pen it's
[00:38:47] been good so far it's just I I can't be
[00:38:49] bothered sometimes to like sit down for
[00:38:51] like 7 hours chained up and [ __ ] do
[00:38:53] it but I'm excited to do it and we will
[00:38:56] do it this week before for the live
[00:38:58] stream so I don't get spoiled and we can
[00:38:59] watch party the star 2.2 together
[00:39:01] without me getting spoiled agreed agreed
[00:39:03] also
[00:39:07] also this is cool and destruction is my
[00:39:10] favorite [ __ ] path so I'm happy she's
[00:39:12] destruction uh with that said I think
[00:39:15] Sam is cooler than Firefly but I like
[00:39:17] both Sam is just bigger and girthier in
[00:39:20] fact who do you think is bigger AR uh
[00:39:23] Sam or arino
[00:39:30] she's so
[00:39:31] Majestic
[00:39:34] yeah Zio doesn't like women no I love
[00:39:37] women I just think okay I I'm going to
[00:39:40] be real okay this is going to be like a
[00:39:42] bad take but like I feel like it's rarer
[00:39:44] to see gacha games have cool looking men
[00:39:46] than [ __ ] women cuz they always just
[00:39:48] make like the same Four Women characters
[00:39:50] and then cycle their [ __ ] same ass
[00:39:51] design it's kind of I mean a lot of
[00:39:53] gench and men look the [ __ ] same like
[00:39:54] a to be fair but like it's like dude Sam
[00:39:58] is like [ __ ] gigachad robot like when
[00:40:00] the [ __ ] do you get to play that that's
[00:40:02] just
[00:40:06] rare that shit's
[00:40:08] rare but also um where's arlino I mean
[00:40:12] arlino is pretty Peak and unique
[00:40:21] so Rio built diff though I mean yeah he
[00:40:25] is built a little different
[00:40:32] should had short hair dude I'm going be
[00:40:34] honest like I still in my head Aro still
[00:40:37] has short hair like I don't even notice
[00:40:39] her [ __ ] long hair where even is it I
[00:40:41] guess it's like a ponytail right yeah I
[00:40:42] don't even see
[00:40:43] it she just has like [ __ ] yolan
[00:40:46] finina haircut in my head like I don't
[00:40:48] even notice that that's like she has a
[00:40:50] [ __ ] thing behind I don't
[00:40:55] know but I I mean like I'm not staring
[00:40:57] at her [ __ ] hair so I don't
[00:41:01] know
[00:41:03] yeah
[00:41:05] anyways anyways so that's my yapping for
[00:41:08] for that's the that's my yapping
[00:41:10] concluded uh first grade magic is POG um
[00:41:13] why am I talking about the weapon matter
[00:41:14] let me close that uh looking um um what
[00:41:19] else did I miss anything
[00:41:21] oh yeah there's also another [ __ ]
[00:41:24] um uh what is it called like a game mode
[00:41:26] like mode for Star it's it's kind of
[00:41:28] like in the in the gap of pure fiction
[00:41:32] andoc they're adding like a thing in the
[00:41:34] middle so it's like 1 2 3 I no it's like
[00:41:36] one two they're like lined up of like
[00:41:38] like Cycle One cycle two or whatever the
[00:41:40] [ __ ] and then they have another thing
[00:41:41] going on in between I don't know I could
[00:41:43] pull up the article but it's pretty cool
[00:41:44] it's just hunt propaganda so that's kind
[00:41:47] of cringe but it's
[00:41:49] fine hunt focus is it's [ __ ] hunt
[00:41:51] propaganda like we've got an nil
[00:41:53] propaganda we've got an erudition
[00:41:55] propaganda this is just hunt propaganda
[00:41:57] it's just some [ __ ] single Target
[00:41:58] [ __ ] for the like one remaining hunt
[00:42:00] player to be happy I'm sorry that was

[00:42:46] fine power creep

[00:43:28] better right surely my chatter is no
[00:43:30] better don't fall for that bait genin
[00:43:32] has it star has it genin's different cuz
[00:43:35] genin when someone comes out I feel like
[00:43:37] you know cuz the game's older like you
[00:43:40] know if a support's really good they're
[00:43:42] going to be good for like years star we
[00:43:44] don't really know yet maybe like I I you
[00:43:46] know Ron Ron May is [ __ ] broken
[00:43:48] she'll probably be broken for a long
[00:43:50] time but
[00:43:54] like I mean yeah there's been a lot of
[00:43:56] new characters that like Lua came out
[00:43:59] best healer wo came out best healer fan
[00:44:01] came out best [ __ ] sustained Avent

[00:44:49] is it seems like they're doing some
[00:44:52] diversity like for example acon is like
[00:44:54] super unique [ __ ] like debuff gives
[00:44:56] her all [ __ ] like that there's been like

[01:01:03] day two I pull on like 10 or whatever
[01:01:05] viewer accounts and then we make a video
[01:01:07] from that the only problem with day two
[01:01:09] like and it ensures one consistent
[01:01:12] double stream and two it lets us
[01:01:14] stalling the only downside of that is
[01:01:17] like everyone's just going to like
[01:01:18] impulse pull day one but it doesn't
[01:01:20] really matter for the content cuz like
[01:01:23] it's still the same content like no one
[01:01:25] cares like I feel like day one I'd
[01:01:27] rather if I'm a viewer I'd rather watch
[01:01:28] someone play arino than pull for arino
[01:01:31] personally but I'm also not like a gacha
[01:01:33] addict so I don't know like I don't
[01:01:35] really care about PS like woo but like
[01:01:37] like day two is hype but or I mean day
[01:01:39] one's also hype but like I'd rather play
[01:01:41] the character so I don't know I don't
[01:01:42] want to be like not able to level my AR

[01:06:52] she needs a dser on her mic I have I had
[01:06:54] that problem too and and uh recording

[01:44:56] I can't level her unless I do
[01:45:02] that ABBA looking how's that
[01:45:11] looking you have to do 2.1 story I'll do
[01:45:13] it this week but if I do it now it's six
[01:45:15] hours which means I would be done
[01:45:17] knowing my stalling let's say 3 + 7
[01:45:19] that's 10:00 a.m. I'd be done at [ __ ]
[01:45:21] like 10: a.m. and then not only that but
[01:45:24] then I'd have to [ __ ] like I would
[01:45:25] even have time to
[01:45:28] sleep overworking
[01:45:39] okay how about G and G that's what I was
[01:45:42] thinking of
[01:45:44] doing I was thinking of gearing my
[01:45:47] golden you already [ __ ] up your sleep
[01:45:49] schedule well I need to dude they
[01:45:50] release characters at like 11: on my
[01:45:52] time I know it's like for other time
[01:45:53] zones but 11:00 p.m. the character's out
[01:45:55] so I have to wake up at like [ __ ]
[01:45:56] like 8:00 p.m. or like
[01:46:01] 600 I also want arlino video to be out
[01:46:03] day one if I can so I'm I'm going to
[01:46:05] like have to grind I won't be minute one
[01:46:07] cuz I'm G be honest chat it might be a
[01:46:09] [ __ ]
[01:46:10] like uh 28 minute video again maybe 30
[01:46:15] hopefully not but if I can get that out
[01:46:17] day one that's POG so we'll see
[01:46:24] dude like like like okay I don't know
[01:46:26] did they show more than one talent but
[01:46:28] like even this one Talent like
[01:46:30] dude like like like like like like you
[01:46:34] like I you L you literally
[01:46:43] can't you literally can't pay me to Yap
[01:46:46] more than this like I can't even write a
[01:46:48] talent longer than this if I tried
[01:47:10] okay also since this is all here as
[01:47:12] official
[01:47:13] info
[01:47:16] uh and she skilled all of these dudes
[01:47:19] but it says a skill should only give 65%
[01:47:21] if you [ __ ] pop it uh but as you can
[01:47:26] see on the health bar here it looks like
[01:47:28] that Bond of life is more than 65%
[01:47:30] because the the way the bond of Life
[01:47:32] health bar Works isn't actually 100%
[01:47:34] it's 200% because the cap is 200 of a
[01:47:36] bond of life so if it's all over your
[01:47:38] health bar that means you're at 200% not
[01:47:39] 100 and because she gains so much here
[01:47:41] is it safe to assume that uh because
[01:47:44] it's on three enemies and she did this
[01:47:47] uh and God a bond of Life bigger than
[01:47:49] just 65 uh that it uh uh it's bigger per
[01:47:54] enemy like an AOE you get
[01:48:00] more yeah look at how big that is which
[01:48:03] means in AOE you get more
[01:48:11] true
[01:48:19] Suk it it doesn't actually matter though
[01:48:22] chat but yeah anyways it's fine hi can
[01:48:24] you watch arino demo again please I
[01:48:26] missed
[01:48:41] it
[01:48:46] yeah anyways
[01:48:56] there's an error in the corresponding
[01:48:58] graphic material we apologize for the
[01:49:05] inconvenience dude she's so sick okay

[01:56:11] pre-fire a
[01:56:12] guide before I get to [ __ ] play
[01:56:18] them I'm not pre-firing where the [ __ ]
[01:56:21] am I
[01:56:24] no bond of Life analogy wait maybe I
[01:56:26] should cook one up it's just a reverse
[01:56:29] Shield that's all it

[01:56:33] this instead of getting like [ __ ]
[01:56:35] like like plus healing you you you you
[01:56:42] don't no CC experience I mean hopefully
[01:56:46] not that would dude I [ __ ] hate I'm
[01:56:49] sorry like no disrespect I'm grateful to
[01:56:51] be in it for star rail but I would
[01:56:53] [ __ ] hate if genin had it like I if
[01:56:55] it does hopefully I'm in it but like I
[01:56:57] would hate it if they did so hopefully
[01:56:59] they don't I don't know like no like
[01:57:01] it's fine like I get why they're doing
[01:57:02] it like I get it but like why dud I I
[01:57:06] don't want to have to [ __ ] talk about
[01:57:07] a character a week before they're out
[01:57:09] and then no one gets to play them and
[01:57:10] you're just like looking at something
[01:57:11] that you can't do and you're like wow
[01:57:12] can't wait to pull for them in seven
[01:57:14] days and then seven days I have to cover
[01:57:15] them again once everyone I just don't
[01:57:17] like it I don't know it's fine like it's
[01:57:18] fine I
[01:57:20] just yeah yeah that's just my personal
[01:57:24] bias
[01:57:31] though you get more money right I mean
[01:57:34] probably but like I don't care like
[01:57:35] that's not my [ __ ] motivation I'm not
[01:57:37] like yeah I need to maximize my Revenue
[01:57:40] when I'm making a video if if you okay
[01:57:43] if you actually if your priority is
[01:57:46] maximizing Revenue you would never ever
[01:57:50] release a 42-minute guide
[01:57:53] this is double
[01:57:54] [Music]
[01:57:55] speed dude my my videos are only long as
[01:57:59] [ __ ] cuz I [ __ ] can't stop yapping
[01:58:03] and like I feel like it's incomplete if
[01:58:04] I don't add
[01:58:06] everything like I feel like cuz cuz dude
[01:58:09] I I feel like sometimes I'll watch a
[01:58:11] video and like I'll scroll to the
[01:58:13] comments and there's like 500 questions
[01:58:16] and I try to like answer everything like
[01:58:19] okay I'm not kidding I started like I
[01:58:21] started recording I mean you guys know
[01:58:23] this but like as I was talking about
[01:58:26] what Bond of life is I was like mentally
[01:58:28] like maybe I should explain this in my
[01:58:29] video more so I might have to [ __ ]
[01:58:31] add more [ __ ] but whatever it's fine I
[01:58:33] mean I explained it I just didn't say it
[01:58:34] expires after 10 minutes but it doesn't
[01:58:36] really matter cuz you're not playing for
[01:58:37] [ __ ] 10 minutes without fighting
[01:58:39] something like you're not just walking
[01:58:41] around like with your [ __ ] 10-minute
[01:58:42] Bond of
[01:58:44] Life maybe you
[01:58:47] are time for good old counter
[01:58:52] on the Still Waters of
[01:58:54] obl time

[01:59:00] it for complicated characters in the
[01:59:05] future no no I'm I'm saying I already do

[01:59:23] today chat I think we do a run but I
[01:59:25] want to do a memory chaos run first like
[01:59:26] we already cleared it we cleared it
[01:59:27] first try Okay easy no big deal uh no
[01:59:29] big deal you know no big deal I'm just
[01:59:31] like that all good uh I'm like that all
[01:59:33] good but I want to um I don't know I
[01:59:34] want to try like another team I don't
[01:59:36] know cuz I feel like we kind of just
[01:59:38] played good characters and cleared it so
[01:59:40] I want to like force myself to clear it
[01:59:43] again I meant Early Access oh I mean if
[01:59:47] I might I'm not saying I won't make
[01:59:48] videos of that if it's available like
[01:59:51] that's fine fine for Star rail whatever
[01:59:54] it's fine like I like I don't I don't
[01:59:56] think it's a bad thing it's fine and if
[01:59:58] I get that I I might make one but I'm
[02:00:01] saying I hope it doesn't happen for
[02:00:03] genin 2 that's all cuz like I don't want
[02:00:05] to I don't
[02:00:07] know eight Cycles used arm dude I'm not
[02:00:10] speed
[02:00:12] running I'm
[02:00:19] sorry anyways we're going to play Acron
[02:00:21] first half and then some random [ __ ]
[02:00:23] second half
[02:00:25] thoughts none wait do I have
[02:00:28] Trend where's my Trend okay I do wait
[02:00:31] that's not
[02:00:35] Trend serval team sniffer why would you
[02:00:38] type either either of those three words
[02:00:41] why would you type any of them why would
[02:00:43] you type all either I don't even have
[02:00:45] server leveled you could have said
[02:00:46] jinguan team and then excluded the
[02:00:48] sniffer but no
[02:00:52] why am I using silver wolf I actually
[02:00:53] don't know wait no cuz this
[02:00:56] half
[02:00:57] um honestly on this half it's not bad
[02:01:01] cuz I feel like yeah yeah on this half
[02:01:02] it's good cuz the death shred is um like
[02:01:05] I feel like kolia is going to out like
[02:01:06] I'll kill them passively cuz Arron's AOE
[02:01:08] so I think I just debuff the tankier one
[02:01:10] I think it's fine second half I don't
[02:01:12] know though second half kind of wants
[02:01:14] paila actually second half dude every
[02:01:16] half wants paa I don't know what do I
[02:01:18] want to play I already cleared this with
[02:01:20] a ratio let's try something else I could
[02:01:22] play imer I could play dude I feel like
[02:01:26] blade probably sucks here but I want to
[02:01:27] play blade I want to say that I've
[02:01:29] cleared with blade you know I'm a blade
[02:01:31] lover I guess jinglu blade but then it's
[02:01:33] just jinglu carrying and then lowkey
[02:01:36] benching blade might be higher DPS but
[02:01:38] blade is fun and I could play Ronald
[02:01:41] Ronald May
[02:01:43] windr oh no wait we're fine well okay
[02:01:46] just I mean no one cares about the
[02:01:47] ascended if you're [ __ ] getting stun

[02:02:10] what does that even mean okay let me
[02:02:12] pick a character
[02:02:16] um honestly it's probably just jinglu I
[02:02:20] kind of forget how broken jinglu is cuz
[02:02:21] it's been a while since I played her so
[02:02:22] I'm not to play her again I do want a
[02:02:24] nil support with her though I mean I
[02:02:27] guess I could just Ron may and like Bron

[02:43:32] backseat if you want but only like
[02:43:34] that's why I have a few VIPs that like
[02:43:37] have game knowledge cuz then if I'm dumb
[02:43:38] and they say something I'm like oh my
[02:43:40] bad but like you're just a dumbass like
[02:43:42] it is what it is like sparkle brono but
[02:43:44] you're going speed boots like are you
[02:43:45] yapping or are you yapping 162 16 like

[02:43:53] please explain what would it do other
[02:43:55] than lower my 7,400 HP please explain
[02:43:58] exactly that's what I thought keep
[02:44:00] getting carried by acaron I'm trying to
[02:44:02] use a real man's character that's copium
[02:44:04] I'm coping but I'm trying okay I'm
[02:44:07] trying it's fine it's fine but my
[02:44:10] Blade's good he his ratio is good his HP
[02:44:12] is good you don't need
[02:44:13] speed not even 10K HP
[02:44:17] okay okay
[02:44:21] calm down my bad my
[02:44:24] fault our silver wolf is scuffed now
[02:44:26] though but it's
[02:44:31] fine wait why am I sub 4K what did I
[02:44:35] change
[02:44:38] um oh I'm on the follow-up set what was
[02:44:41] I using I used like this for more than
[02:44:44] didn't I swap to this or some [ __ ] do I
[02:44:46] have the [ __ ]
[02:44:49] no no wait what was the other piece
[02:44:54] oh um Modge
[02:44:57] check Modge oh I was on this 15 defense
[02:45:00] seven speed right 4K okay that's what it
[02:45:04] was blaz not good yeah I know but low
[02:45:16] key wait what using Sparkle eing last
[02:45:19] dice roll would have brought blade back
[02:45:20] up before turn cycle oh yeah I guess
[02:45:23] there's no point in kicking the [ __ ]
[02:45:25] dice would we even have killed with one
[02:45:27] more turn though maybe
[02:45:29] actually okay dude but like surely Ron
[02:45:31] May here just like full clears Am I
[02:45:33] Wrong Maybe I'm Wrong whatever it's
[02:45:41] fine I mean or we just like or we just
[02:45:44] put jinglu and then like you know but
[02:45:55] if you didn't miss
[02:45:57] anything everything oh
[02:46:01] Gage honestly even P would be
[02:46:05] better why are you forcing blade cuz I
[02:46:08] like them damn let me like a character
[02:46:11] damn
[02:46:19] I mean pill might be better
[02:46:21] honestly no there's no
[02:46:37] way there's actually no
[02:46:40] way I mean it might honestly be [ __ ]
[02:46:43] um
[02:46:51] it might be
[02:47:02] [ __ ] the thing is it can't even be
[02:47:04] silver wolf because if we play silver
[02:47:06] wolf like yeah silver wolf is good in
[02:47:08] single Target but we literally gamble a
[02:47:10] one out of [ __ ] four uh three implant
[02:47:14] cuz he's he's literally not weak to any
[02:47:16] of our things it's [ __ ] one and three

[03:25:26] [ __ ] energy dude another Journey
[03:25:29] Begins Waters of
[03:25:33] obliv I wait for the
[03:25:36] Department no I'm asking a question who
[03:25:38] should I pull for oh it depends on your
[03:25:41] teams I mean I'm going to be honest I
[03:25:44] love Sparkle but I still think Ron May
[03:25:45] is [ __ ] stupid broken but a lot in a lot
[03:25:48] of teams Sparkle is like a lifesaver so
[03:25:51] kind of depends on what you're
[03:25:55] [Music]
[03:25:59] running give me the
[03:26:01] debuff wait they already had the debuff
[03:26:03] so I didn't get one okay wait unless

[03:26:15] another
[03:26:17] netk activated time for a good old
[03:26:22] counter I'm also okay my I think my
[03:26:25] biggest bias in Star rail like this
[03:26:27] could be a good thing or a bad thing but
[03:26:29] like at least I'm honest about it I
[03:26:31] think my biggest bias in Star rail is I
[03:26:33] think weakness breaking enemies and like
[03:26:36] going more often even if it's just to
[03:26:38] [ __ ] break more and [ __ ]
[03:26:39] characters that give you break
[03:26:40] efficiency and anything like that is
[03:26:42] [ __ ] broken I think like I I value
[03:26:45] that higher than most I think it's so
[03:26:46] [ __ ] dude it's so nice just delay the
[03:26:48] enemy action and then [ __ ] go more
[03:26:50] and I don't know sskk break I'm not

[03:27:13] about break effect bro okay I'm not even
[03:27:16] talking about that I'm talking about
[03:27:17] just like like like [ __ ] like like
[03:27:19] even with like acaron part of the reason
[03:27:22] why like using your skill is nice cuz it
[03:27:25] [ __ ] even though it's like a lot less
[03:27:26] damage than your Al it's cuz it [ __ ]
[03:27:28] um It'll like break enemies so if you go
[03:27:30] if you go faster like yeah you can
[03:27:32] player turbo slow with fast supports but
[03:27:34] like even with like with their LOD going
[03:27:36] fast not only applies more debuffs but
[03:27:38] it also like it it does some break

[03:48:39] box it and I had this set in cop goddess
[03:48:42] Silla when will you resp to my please
[03:48:51] again
[03:48:57] um what was I gonna
[03:49:00] say wait where the [ __ ] did I have song
[03:49:02] of days past was it in
[03:49:04] Cope
[03:49:11] s okay all right that's the recording
[03:49:14] outro
[03:49:16] shut the freak up chat shut the freak up
[03:49:19] oh when I click end recording it's going
[03:49:20] to [ __ ] crash the stream again oh
[03:49:23] gay glory
[03:49:30] Abba okay okay okay Z okay Z's from
[03:49:33] another day here uh this was eating on
[03:49:36] my Consciousness so let me make a few
[03:49:38] critical changes before uh you like
[03:49:40] click away okay okay this set the new
[03:49:42] arino domain the bond of Life thing
[03:49:45] uh after looking into arino and her
[03:49:47] weapon H uh what we know about her it it
[03:49:50] very clearly seems like Bond of life is
[03:49:52] going to be more prevalent there's a I
[03:49:54] feel like it cuz why would they release
[03:49:55] a weapon like that so this set might be
[03:49:57] here in the niche tier uh but we'll see
[03:50:00] also I want to point out that um in the
[03:50:04] among the strong box sets if you're like
[03:50:05] a low AR player and you're like just box
[03:50:07] it so I'll never Farm it I think there's
[03:50:09] some sets that are like worth farming
[03:50:10] and I think above all in here is the VV
[03:50:13] set like this set is like low key
[03:50:15] insanely cracked it's just Maiden sucks
[03:50:16] so uh for you this might be a higher
[03:50:18] tier just so you know okay okay I think
[03:50:20] that's literally all I wanted to say
[03:50:21] also song of days past I still don't
[03:50:23] know how to feel about okay that's all
[03:50:26] glory
[03:50:31] Abba we can't see the set okay but like
[03:50:33] you know what these
[03:50:36] are okay that's
[03:50:39] all I think I'm more happy with this I'm
[03:50:41] more happy with this maybe cope maybe
[03:50:43] not and then this this this is probably
[03:50:45] going to be I mean we don't know
[03:50:46] actually this might just be here I mean
[03:50:47] one set is still bad it's still burning
[03:50:49] so like it might be in maybe Co maybe
[03:50:50] not for now but uh it might move up to
[03:50:52] Niche if not only is it good for arino
[03:50:54] but also maybe future you know not us
[03:50:58] but like the weapon aro's weapon
[03:51:00] literally says Hey bond to life POG so
[03:51:04] yeah and then among the just strongbox
[03:51:06] ads VV is like pretty [ __ ] high same
[03:51:08] with like no blast early game but you
[03:51:11] can just strong box it and like strong
[03:51:12] box is pretty big okay that's all
[03:51:16] hello to streer what's your plan for oh
[03:51:18] I can't end the recording or the stream
[03:51:19] might crash oh [ __ ] is on Friday yes
[03:51:23] we'll be live okay so I'm going to be
[03:51:25] live tomorrow for arino
[03:51:27] then live on Friday for the star rail
[03:51:30] poles and then maybe another stream in
[03:51:31] between now I okay okay chat okay chat
[03:51:36] okay for the [ __ ] Arley kops should I
[03:51:40] do do we commit to day two
[03:51:44] or do I YOLO send day one and then delay
[03:51:46] arly Kino testing an
[03:51:53] hour
[03:51:59] yeah okay cuz I think we can do it day
[03:52:03] two and so if we do that then I'm going
[03:52:05] have to stream again so I'll probably
[03:52:07] stream again after day one and
[03:52:12] [ __ ] and I'll put the the thing is I
[03:52:15] don't want to put view like like the the
[03:52:17] forms in the Discord now cuz I feel like
[03:52:18] there's a decent chance people are like
[03:52:20] oh pull on my account and then they like
[03:52:22] apply but then
[03:52:23] like day one they're just going to
[03:52:25] they're oh yeah I'll pull day two but
[03:52:27] then day one they're like oh I want
