[00:15:20] for long enough so I haven't set it up
[00:15:22] yet like I bought a bunch of foam panels
[00:15:23] I just didn't set them up so there's
[00:15:25] still a bit of echo but it is what it is
[00:15:27] um EO dropped bars today wait really oh
[00:15:32] no anyways uh I hope you guys are doing
[00:15:36] well hello we're going to do for those
[00:15:38] of you wondering I said I would do star
[00:15:40] story today I was not lying I
[00:15:43] will uh I'm doing we're doing genin into
[00:15:47] HSR 2.1 story don't hey [ __ ] you it's
[00:15:50] not 2.2 but it is what it is we're
[00:15:53] prepping for 2.2 then we're doing 2.2
[00:15:55] next stream is G be because it's like 10
[00:15:57] hours long dude I looked up HSR 2.2
[00:16:01] um like Quest I didn't want to get
[00:16:04] spoiled I just looked at the duration it
[00:16:06] was like seven 7 hours 50 minutes are
[00:16:09] you [ __ ] me 8 hours that's like three
[00:16:12] movies I could watch opener two and a
[00:16:15] half
[00:16:16] times so it and I saw some tweets like
[00:16:18] oh my God this was Peak fiction it
[00:16:20] better [ __ ] be for eight hours of my
[00:16:22] life you could butter me up [ __ ] put
[00:16:26] me in the oven bake me like a turkey in
[00:16:28] that time
[00:16:29] it better be good although I did see a
[00:16:32] tweet from um probably the shortest
[00:16:34] streamer alive I think um dude
[00:16:39] what dude I was laughing to myself when
[00:16:41] I found this
[00:16:45] gift I don't even okay anyways um uh
[00:16:49] yeah I saw a tweet from probably the
[00:16:50] shortest streamer
[00:16:52] live um fob said finish the do12 story
[00:16:56] in one sitting it is the best main story
[00:16:58] Quest Hoy riverse has done with genin or
[00:17:01] Star rail holy
[00:17:03] moly now this might be true but I'm
[00:17:06] going to be the judge of this we'll do
[00:17:08] it I personally think this sounds like
[00:17:11] recency bias because even after okay
[00:17:14] this is the Zio take of the day so get
[00:17:16] ready to mute your stream I'm pausing
[00:17:17] the music this is the Z take of the day
[00:17:19] everyone said this about every single
[00:17:21] Fontan Quest and while I loved Fontan I
[00:17:23] don't think it was significantly better
[00:17:24] than like Nita's Quest and that was just
[00:17:27] recency bias [ __ ] everyone in the
[00:17:29] anus so I think this is probably a
[00:17:31] similar case but I don't know so we're
[00:17:32] going to do it also I I saw like a few
[00:17:35] one guys oh you give everything 10 out
[00:17:36] of 10 no the [ __ ] I don't Ena Zuma's
[00:17:38] [ __ ] honestly the shanjo L Fu Quest made
[00:17:41] me fall asleep I'm sorry and a lot of
[00:17:43] [ __ ] I don't like but some stuff I do
[00:17:44] like I like Fontan I like sumaru and I
[00:17:47] like 2.0 so far like panacy stuff
[00:17:50] there's some stuff I don't
[00:17:56] like we'll see though
[00:18:00] Z Jeff take no I mean I I disagree with
[00:18:02] zff on a lot of takes the Z Jeff take I
[00:18:03] agree with is that Kerri bar was Peak I
[00:18:05] I agree that I I agree with that
[00:18:08] take but we haven't done two I haven't
[00:18:10] done 2 by two so I don't know I haven't
[00:18:11] finished 2.1 either so we'll
[00:18:15] see we'll
[00:18:19] see um
[00:18:23] anyways anyways
[00:18:29] is today finally star day we star was
[00:18:32] yesterday but we're doing more today
[00:18:33] we're doing we're doing genin into and
[00:18:36] Then star uh finishing the quest that's
[00:18:38] the plan that's the plan that's the plan
[00:18:40] that's the plan that's the plan that's
[00:18:41] the plan that's the plan that's the
[00:18:44] plan also apparently there's no
[00:18:46] copyright strikes on any of the diss
[00:18:48] tracks so I can play these on
[00:18:53] stream so that's cool I didn't know that
[00:18:57] anyways welcome to the Stream
[00:19:00] uh oh dude I [ __ ]
[00:19:03] okay I have a truth that I don't want to
[00:19:06] admit that I'm going to
[00:19:07] admit I spent an unethical amount of
[00:19:12] money

[00:19:36] I bought a [ __ ] okay I bought more
[00:19:38] than one thing I can't lie you might
[00:19:40] want to pre- type CAU in the chat dude I
[00:19:43] bought a [ __ ] uh a
[00:19:46] junko from dongan RPA I like her so I
[00:19:51] bought this
[00:19:53] um I C yo I bought but I bought also
[00:19:57] that's not even that's not my favorite
[00:19:58] character though I just I just saw I
[00:20:00] also bought this [ __ ] cuz he's my
[00:20:01] favorite but um I don't know men i i i
[00:20:06] cuz dude they never have these things
[00:20:07] anywhere so I saw them I was like oh
[00:20:09] [ __ ] I just bought them both but dude
[00:20:11] this thing was like okay the the the the
[00:20:13] the the the the the what's this guy's
[00:20:14] name nagito he was like the price wasn't
[00:20:18] that bad I was like okay like that's
[00:20:19] what I expect the [ __ ] junko one dude
[00:20:22] I rung it up at the cashier he was like
[00:20:24] bro like this is like your whole bank
[00:20:25] account I'm like are you kidding so but
[00:20:27] I didn't back out cuz I'm like [ __ ] it
[00:20:29] I'm In Too Deep so I bought her um also
[00:20:33] apparently they had a [ __ ] what's her
[00:20:34] name Kiri giri but they she was sold out
[00:20:37] I would have bought her anyways so I got
[00:20:39] this [ __ ] wait let me open it wait is
[00:20:41] this like uh am I not supposed to open
[00:20:42] these is it depreciation whatever I
[00:20:44] don't
[00:20:47] care okay I can't open it anyways uh
[00:20:51] this guy I love
[00:20:53] him that's nendo for you okay but like
[00:20:55] why would you pay I feel like it's a
[00:20:57] scam I mean I bought it so I got scammed
[00:21:00] but like why are they so
[00:21:01] expensive I I mean I guess there's like
[00:21:03] different poses maybe that's why but
[00:21:06] like why is [ __ ] good smile company a
[00:21:08] million
[00:21:12] dollars they's super high quality yeah
[00:21:14] that's what I saw like I looked it up
[00:21:16] before buying it like eBay was selling
[00:21:18] it for more than I bought so eBay is
[00:21:20] selling it for $50 more than I spent so
[00:21:22] technically it's an investment and I'm
[00:21:23] making money if I don't open this box I
[00:21:26] made $50 so technically I get scammed
[00:21:31] but
[00:21:34] but it's still too expensive so I don't
[00:21:36] know I I kind of want to open it though
[00:21:38] I don't know what I'm going to do we'll
[00:21:39] see I'll probably open it but anyways I

[00:27:39] um yeah this setup's a work in progress
[00:27:41] but we'll be home soon don't worry about
[00:27:43] it uh I have a lot to do today I really
[00:27:46] was going to do I promised I was going
[00:27:47] to do just starl questing today but I
[00:27:49] was like I kind of want to play genin
[00:27:53] because I some people have suspected
[00:27:59] okay some of you know um or have heard
[00:28:02] about the Ghost Rider
[00:28:06] allegations because I am like the
[00:28:08] Shakespeare of genin and yes it's
[00:28:11] true admits the beef I have acquired
[00:28:14] 2000 resin now obviously it's not
[00:28:16] possible to get 2000 resin just by
[00:28:18] playing the game so clearly I have
[00:28:20] connections to uh people in the industry
[00:28:24] um you know um not going to name any
[00:28:27] names
[00:28:29] but it is what it is uh so we do have
[00:28:31] 2,000 resin to spend I'm not raing your
[00:28:37] sh so you know that's what it is um dude
[00:28:44] I was at the [ __ ] Eden Center today
[00:28:46] cuz I'm in I'm in the I'm in Toronto dud
[00:28:48] the [ __ ] okay no no flame no shade
[00:28:51] the OVO the OVO store was
[00:28:56] empty was
[00:29:08] wait huh I was there it's always empty
[00:29:11] really I don't know I just looked in for
[00:29:13] a second I didn't like go in I the only
[00:29:15] places I went to was I went to buy these
[00:29:17] [ __ ] these things and I bought um
[00:29:20] where did I
[00:29:21] go I went to like Swatch cuz we want to
[00:29:24] get a a gift for someone but they didn't
[00:29:26] have what I wanted
[00:29:31] um where else did I go I don't even know
[00:29:35] oh I got
[00:29:38] T what's your arino rank like 60 or
[00:29:42] something are are I is back at number
[00:29:44] two it is what it is we'll get one I
[00:29:46] think all this means is back at number
[00:29:48] two I I now I assume if I download the
[00:29:51] optimizer I could probably configure a
[00:29:52] build that's number one but because
[00:29:55] we're number two do you know what this
[00:29:56] means it means we have to farm more Echo
[00:29:58] which means it's actually uh smart for
[00:30:00] us and resin efficient to farm
[00:30:02] Vermillion because we can get number one
[00:30:04] iyo and Bill Chia so it's technically
[00:30:07] optimal to do Echo I mean Vermillion
[00:30:09] it's it's not even copium anymore um but
[00:30:12] dude are AR Lino went from like okay I
[00:30:15] just [ __ ] her buildup but she went
[00:30:17] from let pull up my Discord I sent this
[00:30:20] to
[00:30:23] Sam my my arino went
[00:30:26] from okay you know how I spent like 5K
[00:30:29] resin building her and that's going to
[00:30:30] be a video in that video the the the end
[00:30:33] build is pretty good but she's like her
[00:30:35] rank is like top 10K top
[00:30:37] 8K my glad build that I already had
[00:30:41] granted I have to take the pieces from
[00:30:42] other
[00:30:44] characters could you answer my previous
[00:30:47] glad pretty please so yeah it is what it
[00:30:50] is m is 5K could you answer my previous
[00:30:55] donation um How do you have that much
[00:30:59] resin
[00:31:01] okay you might have been living under a
[00:31:03] rock and you haven't heard of the
[00:31:05] Kendrick Drake drama that's going on uh
[00:31:08] you should catch up on it it's pretty
[00:31:10] entertaining um it's actually pretty
[00:31:12] entertaining unlike genin drama which is
[00:31:14] cringe and middle schoolers arguing it's
[00:31:16] actually entertaining you should go

[00:41:27] okay we already talked about this
[00:41:29] there's no beef okay I don't know like
[00:41:31] this was just a misunderstanding me and
[00:41:33] Jenny were fine we're cool right Jenny
[00:41:35] right Jenny right okay right okay stream
[00:41:40] starts Zio talks worst part of the
[00:41:41] stream I can't maybe Z this you just
[00:41:45] wrote a t this is not this
[00:41:49] is I don't even want to read this I'm
[00:41:51] being honest I don't feel like reading
[00:41:52] this this is dude dude the odds of this
[00:41:56] being fake are like 90
[00:41:58] cover of the it goes hard just got back
[00:42:02] from my second date with a girl I've
[00:42:04] been seeing went to a local concert and
[00:42:06] then back to my place we decided to
[00:42:08] watch YouTube on my TV and cuddled on my
[00:42:10] couch asked if I could show her a funny
[00:42:12] YouTube man
[00:42:14] brother I promise you it's not fake okay
[00:42:17] okay okay congratulations but whose
[00:42:21] first instinct what if you you have a
[00:42:23] girl at your house is let me show you
[00:42:26] Zio seek Allah what that's that's your
[00:42:29] first that's your go-to she said yes I
[00:42:32] then played her the abyss randomizer
[00:42:34] video digital footprint video oh Su
[00:42:36] mention and resin stories compilation
[00:42:39] she doesn't know what genin is so I have
[00:42:40] to explain some things but she was
[00:42:42] laughing throughout it I would like to
[00:42:43] announce that we kissed when I walked
[00:42:45] back to her
[00:42:47] car okay well
[00:42:50] congratulations um
[00:42:59] I mean I your decision was questionable
[00:43:02] uh they probably I'm going to keep it
[00:43:04] real with you they were probably already
[00:43:06] into you before you pulled up the Z
[00:43:07] video and then after that video it went
[00:43:09] down a point like let's say they thought
[00:43:11] of you as like a I don't know let's say
[00:43:12] you at like like there's like a bar and
[00:43:15] you had like 80% the the video probably
[00:43:17] dropped it down to like 70% but that was
[00:43:19] still enough to like pass the threshold
[00:43:21] does that make sense so you pass the
[00:43:23] like 50% passing grade
[00:43:29] anyways that's
[00:43:31] funny
[00:43:34] um uh uh congrats I
[00:43:42] guess I mean I trust you chatter so uh
[00:43:46] wait what the [ __ ] edit I also forgot I
[00:43:48] had to tell her what oboba

[00:51:30] talk about oh yeah I want to do okay
[00:51:31] that's the other thing I want to do
[00:51:32] World quests as well because I want I'll
[00:51:35] do these off stream but I want to unlock
[00:51:36] these profile
[00:51:38] pictures I wonder how to get this one I
[00:51:40] hope my favorite inazuman NPC doesn't
[00:51:42] die that would really suck hopefully she
[00:51:44] gets to stay
[00:51:46] alive cloie but yeah we need to unlock
[00:51:49] these
[00:51:51] um yeah
[00:52:00] and so end of May chat end of May expect
[00:52:04] the most streams ever because there's
[00:52:06] going to be the new genin like preview
[00:52:08] stream there's going to be probably
[00:52:10] second half of star Rail and there's
[00:52:11] going to be weathering waves so it's
[00:52:12] going to be like work overload uh I'll
[00:52:15] be at home and [ __ ] but yeah it's going
[00:52:16] to be it's going to be a lot um and I'm
[00:52:18] pretty sure like I'm for sure playing
[00:52:19] all of those I'm going to try to get a
[00:52:21] sponsor stream for weathering but if not
[00:52:23] I'll probably still play it like I'm
[00:52:24] going to I'm definitely going to play it
[00:52:25] so we'll see we'll see if it's good or
[00:52:27] not and then we're definitely doing
[00:52:28] booill stuff and we're also definitely
[00:52:30] doing I mean genin's a little like our
[00:52:33] Lino's really hype but until um once
[00:52:36] second half is here we're just waiting
[00:52:37] for chlorin and then 4.7 is going to be
[00:52:40] pretty big cuz there's like three new
[00:52:42] characters which is insane and then 4.8
[00:52:44] is probably filler patch and then 5.0 is
[00:52:46] not Len and you be like Z how do you
[00:52:48] know there's a 5.0 after 4. uh eight
[00:52:51] they [ __ ] tweeted 5.0 for the first
[00:52:53] time did you see did you dude most

[00:53:57] um where is
[00:53:59] it content
[00:54:04] creators dude I actually okay honest to
[00:54:08] God no lie I got click baited into
[00:54:11] thinking I was quitting I'm not even
[00:54:13] joking I swear to cry okay I knew I
[00:54:16] wasn't quitting but like I was like oh
[00:54:18] [ __ ] is this okay I swear to God I saw
[00:54:22] this I was like oh is this about me I'm
[00:54:23] not even joking I was like oh cool I
[00:54:26] clicked on it it was Mt the whole way
[00:54:27] through oh I got a canadi TI whatever
[00:54:30] but I mean I respect it like I respect
[00:54:31] the The Hustle but it's literally the
[00:54:33] whole way is
[00:54:37] M I was like [ __ ] I got click baited but
[00:54:40] it's okay I respect the
[00:54:42] hustle you're so clickable dude I I
[00:54:45] thought I thought I thought I don't know
[00:54:48] I was like I didn't tweet that is what
[00:54:50] it
[00:54:54] is I was talking to Allan my um editor
[00:54:58] well one of my editors main editor I
[00:54:59] guess he was like uh this is what he
[00:55:01] said not about this it was about um like
[00:55:03] our our leino video the whale video he
[00:55:08] said yo I don't know if I want to expose
[00:55:10] you Alan I'm going to keep it
[00:55:12] real he said dang I have no morals what
[00:55:16] like he said I was asking like what we
[00:55:18] should do about one of our thumbnails
[00:55:19] he's like dang I don't know about you
[00:55:21] but I have no morals when it comes to
[00:55:22] clickbait lamu I think people should
[00:55:24] clickbait the most amount possible it's
[00:55:26] a skill check cuz you have to limit test
[00:55:28] how far you can go before you get
[00:55:31] backlashed I was like I was like no
[00:55:35] that's not
[00:55:41] me it's true okay me personally I think
[00:55:45] that's not a bad take if you're a
[00:55:47] YouTuber like if you're like a content
[00:55:49] if you're like l oh I don't think lwig
[00:55:51] clickbaits that hard well kind of yeah
[00:55:52] he does but if you're like content
[00:55:54] focused I think that's true but like
[00:55:56] I feel like when I was raised on like
[00:55:58] genin YouTube it was like I feel like I
[00:56:01] got click baited a lot and it made me
[00:56:02] angry like like it was like oh [ __ ] like
[00:56:06] but I guess I click baited too at the
[00:56:07] start but well it wasn't
[00:56:10] like like Zio do more damage wow it's
[00:56:13] been 23 years like this video wait where
[00:56:17] is it this
[00:56:19] one I was like dude I see [ __ ]
[00:56:22] be like oh like multiply your damage and
[00:56:24] it was like sh it tilted me so I made an
[00:56:26] actual one and I was
[00:56:28] like hey what's up guys in this video
[00:56:30] we're going to be talking about how to
[00:56:31] deal more damage with every single
[00:56:33] character this is my most Luke official
[00:56:35] Chi sucros requested video and very
[00:56:37] quickly before we even start I just want
[00:56:39] to tell you guys that I am not click
[00:56:41] baiting in like the first clip you okay
[00:56:42] to be fair though I have two stier
[00:56:44] characters in the team three years ago
[00:56:46] so like you got to put some respect on
[00:56:47] my name when I I'm running the exact
[00:56:49] same artifact sets on on a child in two
[00:56:51] different clips but in one I'm using
[00:56:52] support characters and the other support
[00:56:54] characters on the team that aren't doing
[00:56:55] anything and was also this was also no
[00:56:57] no it wasn't clickbait cuz it was
[00:56:58] actually talking about support
[00:56:59] characters reactions and like what
[00:57:02] supports use Resource Management
[00:57:04] artifacts and all that [ __ ] back in the
[00:57:06] time where do more damage was just hey
[00:57:08] level your artifacts true 10K to 200k 20
[00:57:11] times more uh and honestly it could out
[00:57:14] of breath I don't know damage if you
[00:57:16] don't have artifacts you don't have a
[00:57:17] good weapon all that stuff so we're
[00:57:18] going to talk about the importance of
[00:57:19] support characters element go okay so
[00:57:21] what we're going to talk about now is
[00:57:22] tartaglia Bennett wait this is actually
[00:57:24] base though it's not a good team but
[00:57:25] it's
[00:57:26] reac if you guys don't think this is
[00:57:28] important this is literally the biggest
[00:57:30] part of this video the most
[00:57:32] misunderstood and most important thing
[00:57:33] hly by far like you guys will see I'm
[00:57:35] going to show you guys how hard I can
[00:57:37] hit on this py plant with just nothing
[00:57:39] just child pressing q and then it show
[00:57:41] you guys how hard I hit um a clip from
[00:57:43] that I recorded in the past where I
[00:57:45] actually use my supports now keep in
[00:57:47] mind my weapon and my artifacts are the
[00:57:48] same in both videos both Clips the only
[00:57:51] difference is that I'm using my supports
[00:57:52] I don't use any food I don't use any
[00:57:53] potions nothing it's just the power of
[00:57:55] supports and I'm reactions bro playing
[00:57:57] Moto Hydro okay I think the point of
[00:57:59] this was I Vaped on child cuz I think at
[00:58:01] this time child Shang Ling was not known
[00:58:04] this was November I put a [ __ ] colon
[00:58:06] p in the the
[00:58:15] description a Col
[00:58:18] P the purpose of this video play the
[00:58:20] game let's go I one shot pyro plants
[00:58:23] okay this is kind of cringe I can't even
[00:58:24] watch this back I actually can't even
[00:58:26] watch his
[00:58:28] back okay I'll skip forward dealer uh oh
[00:58:32] my God wait let me account riew myself
[00:58:34] 80 child 60 Bennett 61 Barbara 60 sucros
[00:58:37] duuk is leveled kachang Fishel I don't
[00:58:40] know why Amber is 65 ning Wong venty
[00:58:43] Chi-Chi my Shang Ling and think are like
[00:58:45] level two please watch my chicken if not
[00:58:48] I'll phone up your buddy
[00:58:50] Barack I mean this in the nicest way
[00:58:53] possible [ __ ] your stupid ass chicken
[00:58:55] I'm sorry no disrespect to your chicken
[00:58:57] no disrespect let's use du as an example
[00:58:59] because child is the main DPS but
[00:59:00] without constellations you kind of want
[00:59:02] two DPS with them so let's just let's
[00:59:03] say you're using duuke right what do you
[00:59:05] want as a support for deluke you want
[00:59:07] someone that can maximize his damage by
[00:59:08] proing a lot of Elemental reactions oh
[00:59:11] no so if you want to be spamming
[00:59:13] overload over which will just give you a
[00:59:16] ton more damage now the best reaction
[00:59:18] with pyro is melt so running something
[00:59:21] okay not even a bad take this I mean
[00:59:22] vaporize is better but no wait k
[00:59:26] that will let you proc melt a lot which
[00:59:28] will double your damage right every time
[00:59:30] you use a pyro ability on melt it'll do
[00:59:31] two times okay this is fine this is fine
[00:59:34] this is fine as long this is fine k k
[00:59:36] the Luke is actually good K the Luke is
[00:59:37] good and then swap to kind of like you
[00:59:39] want a bit more cryo than just K you
[00:59:41] want two but you know like at least Dam
[00:59:44] right because that's how melt works and
[00:59:45] it's just crazy so running a good party
[00:59:47] is
[00:59:48] [ __ ] especially it is what it
[00:59:52] is it is what it is don't talk to me
[00:59:57] anyways okay uh B of view bro just use
[01:00:01] hyper blo you think was level 10 in the
[01:00:04] clip okay we I pretty sure starting

[01:00:12] somewhere in that those months duuke
[01:00:14] sing trro was known to be really good
[01:00:16] and I talked about it but I was like I
[01:00:17] don't want to play SRO cuz he's in every
[01:00:19] [ __ ] team ever but then eventually I

[01:03:32] literally
[01:03:34] okay you can pull up the straightest man
[01:03:37] in the world literally find him if if if
[01:03:40] sexuality is a spec if it's like a
[01:03:41] spectrum or like a circle I think that's
[01:03:43] called a spectrum then that has to mean
[01:03:45] that at somewhere there's the
[01:03:45] straightest person and the gayest person
[01:03:47] you could find the straightest person in
[01:03:49] the world bring them in the room tell
[01:03:51] them to look at Felix from straight kids
[01:03:52] and he'll be like okay that man is
[01:03:54] beautiful like that man is is
[01:03:56] beautiful he just is he just is he just

[01:04:02] the
[01:04:04] Dragons he's beautiful it is what it
[01:04:07] is it is what it
[01:04:10] is anyways no okay sorry anyways
[01:04:15] um Banner review that's what we're going
[01:04:18] to do Banner
[01:04:23] review a remains
[01:04:26] okay so let's review these banners uh
[01:04:28] I'm really mad about the weapon Banner
[01:04:29] spoiler alert but let's not start there
[01:04:31] let's start with the good we'll do The
[01:04:33] Good the Bad and the Ugly uh Scaro
[01:04:35] wander I like wander I think he's a
[01:04:37] pretty good
[01:04:38] character um so if you want him boom
[01:04:41] he's there um I was debating making uh
[01:04:45] like Banner not Banner but like uh like
[01:04:48] the character review videos I do for
[01:04:49] reruns but I don't know if scar BYU are
[01:04:51] like hype enough for that but anyways
[01:04:53] scar is pretty good
[01:04:56] he's not needed but he's not like bad um
[01:04:59] he gets better with some up like you can
[01:05:01] use him without other Enos and like VV
[01:05:03] him in like taser teams but typically
[01:05:05] you want him with like farzon um so it's
[01:05:08] good that she's on his banner and then
[01:05:09] like Flex Flex uh you could do finina
[01:05:12] teams you could do a cryo character I
[01:05:14] usually like running a cryo with him
[01:05:16] like Rosario or Lila who's on the banner
[01:05:18] so farzon and Lila being here are good
[01:05:20] Leila uh uh I didn't expect farzon to be
[01:05:22] well I did actually but I heard people
[01:05:25] that didn't expect
[01:05:26] okay how do I say this there is a decent
[01:05:28] chance that because farzon was with Shan
[01:05:30] Yun that she wouldn't be with Scara
[01:05:32] again but she is so that's cool for
[01:05:34] Scara um more chances to C6 horiz
[01:05:38] on Bo is always good and her
[01:05:42] constellations are good but she's an old
[01:05:43] character so you might already have them
[01:05:45] Leila is genuinely decent she's a pretty
[01:05:48] decent character she's good with Scara
[01:05:49] decent shielder overall her cons are
[01:05:52] pretty
[01:05:54] good um
[01:05:56] and then there's
[01:05:57] baiju baiju is good I think baiju got
[01:06:00] way better with finina I think without
[01:06:02] finina he's okay um because he's kind of
[01:06:05] like a side grade to yao yao sometimes
[01:06:07] better sometimes worse kind of whatever
[01:06:09] with Farina he's really good one of the
[01:06:11] best healers um not
[01:06:14] well it depends what teams you're
[01:06:16] running cuz some fra teams aren't dendro
[01:06:18] obviously like you could do like Gan you
[01:06:19] could do Bennett you could do whatever
[01:06:20] shenyun but if you're playing a Dedra
[01:06:22] team baiju with finina is really good so
[01:06:25] I actually like him a lot uh with uh if
[01:06:27] you have far uh finina but the four
[01:06:30] stars with baiju don't make sense cuz
[01:06:31] Leila you're not playing with baiju beo
[01:06:33] you can you can play B aggravate with
[01:06:35] him so that's fine but like you don't
[01:06:36] need him for her and then farzon makes
[01:06:38] no sense for BYU so if you're pulling
[01:06:40] BYU the four stars kind of suck but I
[01:06:42] mean he's pretty good so it's fine
[01:06:44] realistically though this looks like a
[01:06:46] I'm saving for clind type Banner but um
[01:06:50] scar byra are pretty
[01:06:52] good now if you pull on this weapon let
[01:06:55] me resume my
[01:06:58] music if you pull on this weapon
[01:07:03] Banner genuinely and I mean this in the
[01:07:05] nicest way possible because we're all in
[01:07:07] this together we're all playing genin
[01:07:09] like look we're a team right we're a
[01:07:11] family you deserve to be bullied I'm
[01:07:13] sorry Jade fall Splender is [ __ ] dog
[01:07:15] [ __ ] Scar's weapon is like good for
[01:07:17] Scara and like okay for like rizzly
[01:07:20] normal attackers fine but like who cares
[01:07:22] like it's like it's good but like I feel
[01:07:24] like CIS have like 50 really good
[01:07:26] options like you could go whith you can
[01:07:27] go any of the battle pass opt like solar
[01:07:29] Pearl you go a bunch of four stars
[01:07:30] there's a lot of good options for like
[01:07:32] catalysts even the new font 10 craftable
[01:07:34] one is good you might have Atlas you
[01:07:37] might have lost prayers there's a lot of
[01:07:38] good ones and Jade fall is just not it I
[01:07:41] have it because I'm a dumbass and I

[01:09:06] my [ __ ] you chat I didn't want that

[01:09:12] during alham update and I'm getting back
[01:09:14] into the game can you give me the
[01:09:16] rundown on anything you think I should
[01:09:18] do dude I've been getting that question
[01:09:20] so much what are your thoughts on a
[01:09:21] video of like everything that changed in
[01:09:24] genin in the past two years or some [ __ ]
[01:09:26] so that people that are coming back they
[01:09:27] kind of know what they missed I feel
[01:09:30] like that' be a
[01:09:32] banger I want to write that
[01:09:34] down everything that changed in genin in
[01:09:38] the since since what though since what
[01:09:41] since like what patch like 3.0 4.0 I
[01:09:44] feel that'd be a good main Channel video
[01:09:45] for like new
[01:09:47] players 1.0 kiss why did I just swear on
[01:09:52] your mother I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[01:09:53] insult your mother
[01:09:58] 2.0
[01:10:02] bro since dend well okay it'll either be
[01:10:05] since 1.0 or it'll be called like in the
[01:10:07] last two years or something that
[01:10:13] [ __ ] 3.0 no need to go
[01:10:16] further yeah maybe 3.0 cuz of dendro
[01:10:34] yeah do it right before not Lan yeah it
[01:10:37] might actually that that's actually a
[01:10:38] good idea in the B patch but but knowing
[01:10:40] me is going to take me so long to edit
[01:10:42] that video that three other people are
[01:10:43] going to make it anyways I think that's
[01:10:45] a good idea pole ding donk yeah but like
[01:10:47] what would I even ask chat you guys are
[01:10:48] a bunch of [ __ ] losers I'm sorry that
[01:10:50] was [ __ ] up but I don't know how to
[01:10:51] format the like I feel like the
[01:10:53] content's good I just don't know how to
[01:10:54] title it you get me
[01:10:59] minus 8 months which HSR Quest are you
[01:11:02] catching up on I haven't watched
[01:11:04] consistently uh we're doing the penty
[01:11:06] quest so we did the first one we're at
[01:11:08] AG we're we're halfway through 2.1 then
[01:11:10] we're doing
[01:11:11] 2.2 I'm real for six months anyways
[01:11:14] Banner review uh so five stars are kind
[01:11:16] of whatever um rage gauge is I don't
[01:11:19] even remember what it does but because
[01:11:21] of that it means it's probably bad Fab
[01:11:23] swword is good but I mean you know
[01:11:26] it's F sword prospector's drill is okay
[01:11:28] sack frags is pretty decent rain slasher
[01:11:30] is pretty decent the four stars are okay
[01:11:32] but please don't pull on this weapon
[01:11:33] Banner cuz the five stars aren't even
[01:11:35] the five stars are kind of whatever
[01:11:36] honestly they're bad and then the four
[01:11:38] stars are
[01:11:39] mid like the four stars are good
[01:11:41] genuinely they're good but like they're
[01:11:42] not like exclusive and astounding like
[01:11:45] it's not like zos Moonlight it's not
[01:11:48] [ __ ] the the HP sword or like what I
[01:11:52] don't even know what like what else do
[01:11:53] you want I guess fav is good any fav
[01:11:54] thing would be good but F like you
[01:11:56] probably have F Swords by
[01:12:00] now what the [ __ ] does range gauge do
[01:12:03] again let me
[01:12:12] check range gauge when the wielder is
[01:12:15] healed or heals others gain a Unity
[01:12:16] symbol uh for each symbol gain three%
[01:12:19] attack this actually isn't bad attack
[01:12:21] percent High base attack this is not bad
[01:12:23] actually
[01:12:26] it Stacks three times so you get what is
[01:12:29] this 9% attack I guess at R5 would be
[01:12:31] double so 18 9 to 18 attack and 21 to 42
[01:12:37] Elemental damage bonus that's actually a
[01:12:39] lot if it scales like
[01:12:41] that yeah this seems pretty
[01:12:49] decent who wants this though yeah that's
[01:12:51] kind of hard cuz you need to make sure
[01:12:53] you get healing ticks like you need a
[01:12:55] Healer that heals you AOE like not AOE
[01:12:57] but like overtime like shenu and Chev
[01:12:59] stuff like that you could use this on
[01:13:01] FAL but FAL snapshots are Oz which means
[01:13:03] you'd have to get healed three times and
[01:13:05] then resummon
[01:13:07] Oz um everyone's having Suk so maybe a
[01:13:12] future character but I guess g could use
[01:13:14] it cuz you get healed as you're on field
[01:13:16] it's probably fine a lot of attack
[01:13:18] Elemental damage run
[01:13:22] us no
[01:13:32] anyways uh chat my keyboard is currently
[01:13:35] spamming
[01:13:40] eights
[01:13:43] hello oh it's soft okay what the [ __ ]
[01:13:48] the [ __ ] was
[01:13:51] that okay we're fine yeah so those are
[01:13:54] my thoughts nothing amazing but the
[01:13:56] character Banners are honestly not bad
[01:13:57] if you want either like if you want scar
[01:14:00] especially these four stars outside of
[01:14:01] maybe B like she's good but like you
[01:14:03] probably have her and you probably have
[01:14:05] constellations as well are pretty
[01:14:10] good
[01:14:15] Cole all right is it stream
[01:14:20] time wait did I even do the Wordle

[01:35:40] when lowkey she's pretty [ __ ] cracked
[01:35:42] just you wait wait until the Banner's
[01:35:44] gone and then you get fomo and
[01:35:46] everyone's like oh my God she's so
[01:35:47] broken just you wait just you wait till
[01:35:49] z is who you should pull for character
[01:35:52] value pull video comes out you know I
[01:35:55] recorded that whole video before Navia
[01:35:57] came out and for some reason it got
[01:35:58] delayed in uploading and I have to
[01:36:00] remake the whole thing because there's
[01:36:01] Navia there's Shan Yun who's not only a
[01:36:03] pretty good pull but also uh brings Shia
[01:36:06] from I don't recommend pulling to a
[01:36:07] pretty good well you know could be good
[01:36:09] pull if you have the upgrades and now
[01:36:11] there's arino too and chori but I mean
[01:36:13] chor is
[01:36:14] chori go
[01:36:19] tomato clarent clears honestly I don't
[01:36:23] know why you're putting two queens up
[01:36:24] against each other I think chind is
[01:36:26] pretty pretty respectable and so is
[01:36:29] arino chlorin is one of my most I think
[01:36:32] chorin was like my favorite when I first
[01:36:35] saw the like Star rail drip it might
[01:36:37] have been it might have been rizzly
[01:36:38] actually it was either Rizzle or clarent
[01:36:40] they're pretty they were pretty
[01:36:43] tied nlet I like more given his like
[01:36:46] lore and how good he is nevet grew on me
[01:36:48] I said star whatever genin drip

[01:53:39] stabiliz I guess that's the way to go
[01:53:41] though if you're like a smaller like
[01:53:42] competing [ __ ] company you just
[01:53:44] monopolize one category like they buy
[01:53:47] every genjin
[01:53:51] streamer trans
[01:53:54] fixed zag on Kick dude he would never
[01:53:56] Z's morals are strong I think Z's morals
[01:54:00] are higher than his like will to live

[02:08:48] know repeated content dude that's
[02:08:53] that's all genin is [ __ ] that's
[02:08:55] all storel is too [ __ ] that's all
[02:08:58] YouTube
[02:09:00] is to be fair though we do have some
[02:09:02] interesting and original content coming
[02:09:04] up like uh transforming our freeto
[02:09:06] playay account uh maybe fixing a
[02:09:07] viewer's cursed account actually
[02:09:08] spending resin uh I want to do a
[02:09:10] challenge where I try to okay I've seen
[02:09:13] I don't know if I've talked about this
[02:09:14] on stream or talked about this to myself
[02:09:15] the voices um but I I yeah I think I
[02:09:18] talked about on stream I want to do a
[02:09:20] video eventually where we like beat
[02:09:21] genin in an x amount of time but every
[02:09:24] video I've seen where it's like let's
[02:09:26] see beating genin
[02:09:29] hours every video I've seen where it's
[02:09:31] like beating genin in certain amount of
[02:09:34] time I think this one was actually the
[02:09:36] abyss but a lot of these are just like
[02:09:37] catching up to the story and like
[02:09:39] there's nothing wrong with that they're
[02:09:41] I'm sure they're like great videos right
[02:09:44] uh like I like I like some of these
[02:09:46] creators like I know some of them you
[02:09:47] know good content but I feel like for my
[02:09:49] audience beating genin would mean 36
[02:09:52] star the abyss or no one would care cuz
[02:09:54] like that's kind of what I do so it
[02:09:57] would it would take like [ __ ] forever
[02:09:59] like that's like minimum
[02:10:02] like a
[02:10:05] month the Eek one was good he did that
[02:10:08] okay did he I'm pretty sure he didn't 36
[02:10:09] star though no disrespect go watch the
[02:10:11] video I'm sure it's great but I'm pretty
[02:10:12] sure I was like did he 36 star and then
[02:10:14] he didn't and I was like oh how the [ __ ]
[02:10:16] would I do this
[02:10:22] yeah anyways I'm not going to spoil it
[02:10:24] for you guys go watch it if you want but
[02:10:27] like
[02:10:29] yeah I'm like I feel like it would be
[02:10:32] pretty hard and it's also a month of my
[02:10:34] like okay let me let me say this this is
[02:10:37] going to sound cocky but like I'm pretty
[02:10:40] sure I could do
[02:10:42] it almost easily but I don't know if I
[02:10:47] want to invest a month of my life for
[02:10:49] one video should abyss and banner yeah
[02:10:52] yeah like I don't blame him like again I
[02:10:55] no flame I'm sure it's a really good
[02:10:56] video I'm just saying I feel like it
[02:11:00] would take like a really long time and I
[02:11:02] don't know if it's worth
[02:11:04] it for
[02:11:09] me like I feel like arlino Banner is
[02:11:11] good cuz AR uh well I mean I guess fem
[02:11:14] Lynette's kind of whatever actually
[02:11:15] never mind arino Banner sucks arino is
[02:11:17] good though
[02:11:29] he played on Stream So double the
[02:11:30] content for you I guess that's smart but
[02:11:34] like the thing is I can't make a lot of
[02:11:36] content I want to make on
[02:11:45] stream is this the same song does this
[02:11:48] play again [ __ ] it
[02:12:03] yeah I mean I could play off stream I
[02:12:05] guess it wouldn't matter but like it's
[02:12:07] so long man a month of
[02:12:12] just
[02:12:17] yeah 68 hours every day okay to be Fair
[02:12:22] though this might sound again I mean I
[02:12:25] guess I guess yeah you need to explore
[02:12:27] for Primo gems so You' literally have
[02:12:29] content for
[02:12:30] like two weeks three weeks maybe maybe
[02:12:34] four if you're doing four no probably
[02:12:36] not
[02:12:38] four yeah
[02:12:40] probably I mean yeah if you're playing
[02:12:42] all day no
[02:13:06] not worth I mean I think it's wor I
[02:13:08] think big project videos are worth I
[02:13:09] think they're really ENT fun to do and
[02:13:11] entertaining to watch like if I'm a
[02:13:13] casual Watcher I like those type of
[02:13:14] videos like I feel almost bad that I
[02:13:18] haven't watched a lot of the videos that
[02:13:19] I just pulled up cuz I'm sure I would
[02:13:20] like watching watching them but it's
[02:13:22] like I don't know I feel like if I make
[02:13:24] genin videos I can't be like watching
[02:13:25] genin videos all day or I want to
[02:13:26] [ __ ] never touch genin again but
[02:13:31] um I I
[02:13:36] like yeah a month straight is probably
[02:13:39] too
[02:13:40] much
[02:13:42] but we'll
[02:13:43] see I think I would do a 24-hour stream
[02:13:48] where like I have to beat something I
[02:13:49] think that would be content like for
[02:13:51] example not like if I'm like cuz right
[02:13:54] now I'm trying to get 1,000 achievements
[02:13:55] if I get like 900 and something I could
[02:13:57] do a stream where I don't end until I
[02:13:58] get 1K I think that would be good
[02:13:59] content and then you could just make
[02:14:01] that into something or like you
[02:14:05] know
[02:14:09] um this [ __ ] song uh that's one idea
[02:14:13] another idea I have is like I mean I
[02:14:15] told you I want to beat every Abyss I
[02:14:17] want to beat Abyss 12 with every
[02:14:18] character not repeating the team like
[02:14:19] not repeating characters and teams so
[02:14:21] that would that would be hard and I want
[02:14:23] Allan thinks it's a good idea for me to
[02:14:24] do Abyss 1 to 12 but anytime anyone
[02:14:28] donates I restart from floor one but I
[02:14:30] feel like that's literally impossible
[02:14:32] cuz someone could donate like a dollar
[02:14:34] and it's just restart but I mean unless

[02:17:58] Lamar special is that true I got no
[02:18:00] problem all right I'm excited man you
[02:18:02] don't even know what I ordered I just
[02:18:03] asked for the Kendrick Lavar special the
[02:18:05] manager ended up ordering us four dishes
[02:18:07] for $66 total and of course the first
[02:18:09] dish he ordered us was the new H King
[02:18:11] House special fried rice they gave us
[02:18:12] the dip sauce of course but personally I
[02:18:14] liked it without it I honestly didn't

[03:03:08] scythe I've been wanting this since
[03:03:09] version negative 1.2 okay but but but
[03:03:13] but it could be a scythe on everyone and
[03:03:16] then oh but how would the plunging work
[03:03:17] just making new animation oh [ __ ] what
[03:03:19] that costs 20 seconds of death time oh
[03:03:21] no oh
[03:03:23] [ __ ] it's literally the whole it's made
[03:03:26] for you to pull on the scam weapon
[03:03:28] Banner it's a scam but it's it's worth
[03:03:30] like it's good for arino it's a good ass
[03:03:32] weapon um but imagine if it was just
[03:03:35] Scythe for everyone
[03:03:38] true they already left it's a money grab
[03:03:44] true it would clip inside half The Poon
[03:03:46] characters it's massive
[03:03:49] hello do we play the same game look at
[03:03:52] this let me show you something let me
[03:03:53] show you
[03:03:54] something have you what the [ __ ] saw you
[03:03:58] okay have you ever seen hello have you
[03:04:00] ever seen a smaller wolves gravestone
[03:04:02] they Scale based on the characters look
[03:04:05] this [ __ ] looks tiny it
[03:04:11] scales this James spe looks like a
[03:04:13] [ __ ] toothpick
[03:04:21] I mean the scyth blade yeah but that can
[03:04:22] scale
[03:04:24] too
[03:04:27] anyways like okay maybe this is like a
[03:04:30] out of touch take but you play you play
[03:04:32] like an indie game and you're like holy
[03:04:35] [ __ ] like this is really good attention
[03:04:36] to detail I can't believe this is there
[03:04:38] and then sometimes you play genin and
[03:04:39] you're like well actually it would take
[03:04:41] death time and the animations would be
[03:04:43] weird it's like bro just [ __ ] then
[03:04:45] fix the animations
[03:04:49] this a billion dollar company like they
[03:04:51] can do
[03:04:55] iten Le Adorn my
[03:04:59] KN transfixed we all know you won't get
[03:05:03] anything good today just get to the two1
[03:05:06] question
[03:05:10] true yeah no but I mean I get the AR I
[03:05:13] mean in my mind I think scye should be a
[03:05:15] weapon type like I'm kind of raing about
[03:05:18] Scythe as a polearm but I think Scythe
[03:05:21] should be a weapon type but it it's
[03:05:23] clear that they wouldn't do that now but
[03:05:24] like I think it would be cool if we had
[03:05:26] Scythe characters that use scythes
[03:05:28] however I think the next best thing is
[03:05:29] making a scythe po arm that could be a
[03:05:31] scythe on other characters and then it
[03:05:32] would slightly be different animations
[03:05:34] like lowkey dude like this is
[03:05:38] like like okay let's say this was just
[03:05:42] it looked like this but like the scy
[03:05:43] part of it was like just a lot longer
[03:05:45] you could still poke with it it still
[03:05:48] wouldn't even look
[03:05:55] bad the plunging animation they'd have
[03:05:57] to make a new plunge animation though
[03:05:59] that's the only thing that I agree would
[03:06:00] look a bit weird but like you could yeah
[03:06:02] it's fine oh what am I doing
[03:06:06] uh single pull every time I misplay
[03:06:09] thoughts no we're going to go
[03:06:16] broke
[03:06:18] o okay I just made a lot of shamain
[03:06:21] really angry I'm sorry yo
[03:06:36] I that
[03:06:38] crazy I'm sorry if you need that
[03:06:40] remember when o was the only pole arm
[03:06:42] user in
[03:06:43] 1. do you really want to only have one
[03:06:46] side user ailable and no F
[03:06:50] versions I don't
[03:06:55] care I think more weapon types is cool
[03:06:57] always it's not going to happen like
[03:06:59] they showed Hoover have they've shown
[03:07:01] that they're willing to give us new
[03:07:05] weapon new weapon types with on new
[03:07:08] weapon classes like like new weapons
[03:07:10] that look different among the already
[03:07:12] defined five weapon types like we got an

[03:12:45] honest um
[03:12:49] the more good Hydro characters there are

[03:13:36] that bad it's just glitchy at times
[03:13:38] which is annoying cuz it's a panic
[03:13:40] button and if your panic button doesn't
[03:13:41] work as a panic button then
[03:13:50] this is the wrong set one if you instead

[03:13:56] Al why okay
[03:14:00] okay thank you for the 100 bits
[03:14:05] s Nava's domain would be a strict waste
[03:14:09] of resin for me whereas there's at least

[03:36:27] want to have to think about it cuz I
[03:36:28] can't think about it like I'm not going

[03:38:34] you're uh uncomfortable being still for
[03:38:36] dude I
[03:38:38] literally sometimes I'll be out of
[03:38:40] breath cuz I'm walking around thinking

[03:38:59] completed how often do you feel
[03:39:02] Restless
[03:39:04] um yeah but I feel like that's the
[03:39:07] nature of like content creation like if
[03:39:09] you're like streaming making videos
[03:39:10] traveling [ __ ] Twitter Tik Tok
[03:39:14] [ __ ] [ __ ] balls like there's so much
[03:39:16] [ __ ] to do how often do you fidget or
[03:39:18] tap with your hands feet or squirm in
[03:39:20] your okay I'm literally doing that right
[03:39:21] now [ __ ] you how often do you find
[03:39:23] yourself excessively talk
[03:39:26] okay I wasn't like this two years ago
[03:39:29] like this is what streaming has done to
[03:39:30] me though like this is like
[03:39:33] manufactured how often do you interrupt
[03:39:35] or intrude on others such as budding
[03:39:37] into their
[03:39:38] conversations I don't think I do
[03:39:44] that take taking over what others are
[03:39:49] doing
[03:39:52] rarely like sometimes but like not like
[03:39:54] I'm not like interrupting
[03:39:59] like I'm not like jumping into
[03:40:03] something I'm a bit more introverted in
[03:40:05] person like I'm still I I kind of force
[03:40:07] myself to be
[03:40:09] extroverted
[03:40:12] um like I kind of forced myself to be
[03:40:14] extrovert Ed but I'm still a little
[03:40:18] likeo shy like I'm kind of just it's
[03:40:21] like a mix of the two I invite people to
[03:40:24] things like whenever I'm like like you
[03:40:26] know like I invite everyone cuz like I I
[03:40:29] I don't know that's how I was
[03:40:31] raised
[03:40:43] but oh that was something I to like
[03:40:45] learn like cuz I always like every time
[03:40:48] I'm like in like in college or
[03:40:49] everything I'd always invite people to
[03:40:50] go out with us wherever we're going and
[03:40:52] then I realized like maybe like one or
[03:40:53] two years ago I'm like [ __ ] like I'm
[03:40:55] like
[03:40:56] a like I have like influence now like
[03:40:58] I'm like a content creator which means
[03:41:00] if I invite people like a whole group
[03:41:02] people will be like I feel like people
[03:41:04] might be like feel like they like need
[03:41:06] to accept or like whatever like so it's
[03:41:09] like [ __ ] with my head and now I'm
[03:41:10] like wary about inviting people cuz like
[03:41:12] I don't want people to be like oh [ __ ] I
[03:41:13] I feel like I have to go I don't know so
[03:41:17] it's [ __ ] with me but for the most
[03:41:19] part this is even the [ __ ] question
[03:41:21] were several of the
[03:41:22] symptoms pres prior h12 no does Sy
[03:41:26] appear in the last two or more settings
[03:41:28] at least two more
[03:41:30] settings no yes well I mean
[03:41:42] yeah you're the extrovert introvert when
[03:41:44] you with a the group of introverts I I
[03:41:46] think I'm more extroverted than
[03:41:47] introverted but I'm
[03:41:54] like
[03:41:57] w I didn't even finish my first thought
[03:41:59] wait wait wait wait like
[03:42:06] yeah no it's [ __ ] with me cuz now I
[03:42:08] don't know if people like talk to me or
[03:42:11] are like yeah like let's hang out or
[03:42:13] like anything like that because I
[03:42:17] like have followers so it's like [ __ ]
[03:42:20] with me so I it's hard to like be just
[03:42:22] like a normal like extroverted person
[03:42:25] when it's like I don't know if someone's
[03:42:26] like yeah I want to go hang out or
[03:42:28] they're like well I feel like I should
[03:42:29] so it's like it's [ __ ] with me a lot I
[03:42:31] don't know anyways but I've gotten
[03:42:33] better in the past like year um but what
[03:42:36] the [ __ ] was I saying yeah this one I
[03:42:38] don't know I assume yes I that's
[03:42:41] it Fang aware no this isn't about Fang
[03:42:45] I know I know like Fang feels genuine
[03:42:47] like I she's a good person but I'm
[03:42:49] saying in general like especially people
[03:42:50] I don't know like this isn't about
[03:42:52] people I've known for a while like
[03:42:53] people that I don't know it's hard to be
[03:42:55] like like hey do you guys want to like
[03:42:57] let's say it's like a group like hey do
[03:42:59] you guys want to go out somewhere and
[03:42:59] then they're like they don't want to but
[03:43:02] they're like yeah let's go just cuz they
[03:43:03] don't want to like not talk to I don't
[03:43:05] know like it's it's hard so I try to be
[03:43:07] more of like a passenger now anyways get
[03:43:11] results 42 out of 58 that's not even bad

[03:59:07] Fearless youngster looking for death huh

[03:59:17] ever thought this
[03:59:19] guy's not even remotely Innovative I
[03:59:23] bought it from Dr Edward he claimed it
[03:59:26] was some exclusive fancy schmancy stuff
[03:59:31] I bought it from Dr Edward the [ __ ] did
[03:59:33] he buy awful first some monster covered
[03:59:37] in eyes stab you in the gut and then all
[03:59:40] you see of blurry glimpses of building

[04:08:19] Rate
[04:08:20] tabloid I thought about it and she had a
[04:08:23] point reporting on stuff like blowing
[04:08:26] out birthday candles and getting spooked
[04:08:27] by Nightmare ghosts isn't exactly
[04:08:30] professional they're calling out the

[04:31:54] payment for the
[04:31:56] drinks please pass it on to her has

[04:32:21] his
[04:32:23] skills Gallagher's going to make me a
[04:32:25] drink flush hello Gallagher that being
[04:32:28] said mixing a drink is way simpler than
[04:32:30] you'd imagine just pick your favorite
[04:32:33] ingredients toss them in a glass mix it
[04:32:35] up and it's done so go ahead explore the
[04:32:39] bar and bring me any ingredients you
[04:32:40] prefer s yes sir nice work let me you
[04:32:44] found some interesting ingredients there
[04:32:47] now each drink has its own flavor and
[04:32:50] the base ingredient sets the tone for
[04:32:52] the initial taste and the lingering
[04:32:55] aftertaste so which one would you like
[04:32:58] to use as the
[04:33:00] base well I only have two uh [ __ ] Soul
[04:33:03] glad all my homies hate Soul glad Pika
[04:33:07] the original formula is said to be hu's
[04:33:10] favorite drink
[04:33:12] it's sour and bitter and the bubbles
[04:33:15] burst in your throat like swallowing
[04:33:17] Rusty chains evoking thoughts of
[04:33:20] Dungeons and
[04:33:21] prisons now that you've chosen the base
[04:33:24] it's time to pick the adjunct the
[04:33:27] ingredient that'll create a marvelous
[04:33:29] chemical reaction with the base it
[04:33:31] should give an unforgettable taste
[04:33:33] without overpowering the main
[04:33:37] tone uh let's do Eternal endurance taste
[04:33:40] is not very intense yet evocative after
[04:33:44] those despicables sent male away M I
[04:33:47] found myself lost in the wilderness of
[04:33:49] my
[04:33:50] dreams they say that even the dirt here
[04:33:53] oozes with
[04:33:55] sweetness huh all I tasted was stoic
[04:33:59] bitterness
[04:34:01] male almost there let's take a
[04:34:04] decoration which style you prefer
[04:34:06] anything you need I've got
[04:34:08] it hanu a symbol of bravery and
[04:34:12] dauntlessness may you break free from
[04:34:14] your shackles just like he
[04:34:16] did well it's
[04:34:21] done Here's to You
[04:34:24] Trailblazer glass of even the wicked to
[04:34:28] the sad
[04:34:30] truth well done
[04:34:32] Gallagher you're not over the hill
[04:34:35] yet so are you
[04:34:39] satisfied oh the flavor
[04:34:42] the richness and layers of these flavors
[04:34:44] are a masterpiece especially with the
[04:34:47] adjunct I can taste the spicy and sour
[04:34:51] notes with a hint of
[04:34:55] sweetness I'm not entirely sure what it
[04:34:57] all means maybe Mr Gallagher can shed
[04:35:01] some light on
[04:35:02] it well if you're expecting a profound
[04:35:05] answer I'm afraid I'll disappoint
[04:35:08] you the imagery it implies is pretty
[04:35:11] straight forward it's just a glimpse of
[04:35:14] what this dream truly tastes like
[04:35:17] nothing
[04:35:17] more does this true taste have anything
[04:35:22] to do with that
[04:35:24] male male I've heard this name in my
[04:35:27] dreams yeah that name does sound
[04:35:31] familiar when got knock out by that
[04:35:33] masked fool girl I think I heard someone
[04:35:36] calling that name do you remember
[04:35:43] I was right about you you guys seem to
[04:35:46] know quite a bit and now there's no
[04:35:49] reason to hide anything from you
[04:35:51] anymore let's dig deeper into the case
[04:35:54] and of course I'll tell you a story
[04:35:57] about
[04:36:00] male all right let's start with what we
[04:36:03] know based on the clues the family has
[04:36:06] it seems that Firefly isn't a local or
[04:36:08] an invited
[04:36:10] guest words
[04:36:12] she's a
[04:36:13] stowaway she managed to fool me at first
[04:36:16] my age must be getting the best of me
[04:36:19] but here on the planet of festivities
[04:36:21] Stow ways are a common sight you're
[04:36:24] bound to run into one sooner or later
[04:36:27] after the incident the hounds wasted no
[04:36:29] time searching for that girl in both the
[04:36:31] Dreamscape and
[04:36:33] reality but here's the thing we only
[04:36:36] received bad news and the tricky is kind
[04:36:38] at that she simply vanished leaving no
[04:36:42] Trace in the Dreamscape or reality as if
[04:36:45] she had never come to pentacon at
[04:36:47] all huh does that
[04:36:55] mean is she a ghost a clever metaphor um
[04:37:00] you you were making a metaphor
[04:37:02] right let me be frank this case
[04:37:07] actually is unlike anything the blood
[04:37:09] hound family has dealt with before dealt
[04:37:12] with before
[04:37:14] so death does happen in pentacon if I
[04:37:18] understand correctly you've witnessed it
[04:37:21] so there's no need to hide even the
[04:37:23] shiniest city has its dark side we're
[04:37:26] all adults here surely I don't need to
[04:37:28] explain too much to you we're all adults
[04:37:31] here and then there's March family based
[04:37:33] on that alone would be naive death may
[04:37:36] occur in sweet dreams so what such
[04:37:39] events are highly unlikely only affect a
[04:37:42] tiny number of
[04:37:43] people if you really want to delve
[04:37:45] deeper into this case you need to
[04:37:48] understand the true problem with the
[04:37:50] family what's the problem gager guess
[04:37:53] it's time to tell the story of that male
[04:37:56] I assume male is the like older Misha we
[04:37:58] saw on the L cone cuz Mel and Misha are
[04:38:00] the same [ __ ] name russal lore I
[04:38:02] think very perceptive but I don't
[04:38:04] [ __ ] know the astral Express has
[04:38:06] received that music box too right do you
[04:38:08] know the secrets it
[04:38:10] holds there is a
[04:38:12] message witness The Impossible in the
[04:38:16] realm of Dreams find the legacy of the
[04:38:19] watch maker father of
[04:38:22] pentacon and thus the answer to the
[04:38:25] question wait where was the
[04:38:27] message on the music
[04:38:32] box why does life Slumber what do life's
[04:38:37] SL that's the exact how does heo how
[04:38:40] does she memorize all of it hey hey why
[04:38:42] are you
[04:38:43] laughing wait did you write it no but
[04:38:47] I'm the officer in charge of this case
[04:38:50] don't how could I not know I'm sure you
[04:38:52] must have noticed that this message
[04:38:54] didn't come from the family you might
[04:38:57] have even guess that the relationship
[04:38:58] between the family and the watchmaker
[04:39:01] isn't as close as it seems I did notice
[04:39:04] that actually just our
[04:39:06] speculation actually it's hard to
[04:39:09] believe that the father of pen con and
[04:39:12] its actual managers are at
[04:39:15] odds now I can assure you that your
[04:39:17] speculation is absolutely
[04:39:19] correct the family is considered the
[04:39:22] watch maker an enemy for a long time so
[04:39:24] so Mel and Sunday are beefing and then
[04:39:26] Sunday was like [ __ ] you die he seems to
[04:39:28] be living only so he kidnapped his son
[04:39:30] Misha stories
[04:39:32] he and now Misha is the hotel servant
[04:39:36] wondered why the family allowed the
[04:39:37] watchmaker to send out such a ridiculous
[04:39:40] message to the outside World inviting
[04:39:42] you here and causing
[04:39:45] chaos so you want to seize this
[04:39:48] opportunity to expose the watch
[04:39:51] maker well now you understand why the
[04:39:55] oak family authorized the nameless to
[04:39:57] assist in the investigation but kept you
[04:39:59] in the dark
[04:40:01] right because the watchmaker is not the
[04:40:04] legend of the land of the dreams at all
[04:40:07] he's the most shameful stain in the
[04:40:10] history of anon
[04:40:11] and he's the root cause of all the
[04:40:13] anomalies in the
[04:40:15] Dreamscape what this has to do with male
[04:40:18] you don't get it well I mean he's the
[04:40:21] watch maker K the betray I [ __ ] knew
[04:40:24] it [ __ ] too easy it's [ __ ] too
[04:40:28] easy it's [ __ ] too
[04:40:32] easy silver
[04:40:34] wolf it's [ __ ] too
[04:40:37] easy dude cuz I was telling you Meeka
[04:40:40] looks too to just be a random ass NPC
[04:40:43] and M and Misha are the same name cuz I
[04:40:45] I watched a video about M tall the chess
[04:40:48] player and then Levy or Levi was like yo
[04:40:51] it's [ __ ]
[04:40:53] Misha I don't know wait aren't we
[04:40:55] supposed to be discussing the watch
[04:40:57] maker I would have expected you to take
[04:40:59] us to maybe a library or an archive room
[04:41:03] of sorts but an amusement
[04:41:06] park the culture of a city reflects its
[04:41:09] history in the most authentic way to you
[04:41:13] it's a fun place but to me it's a prison
[04:41:16] for the planet's past you know that
[04:41:19] pentacon used to be the ipc's prison
[04:41:21] planet right all the prisoners were
[04:41:24] brought here helping the garden of
[04:41:26] recollection Salvage the leaking Memoria
[04:41:29] from the
[04:41:30] macrovoid the prolonged exposure to high
[04:41:33] concentrations of mamoria caused a
[04:41:35] unique phenomenon the dreams of
[04:41:38] countless prisoners intersected and over
[04:41:41] capped and people started meeting each
[04:41:43] other in their dreams living lives that
[04:41:46] were almost identical to
[04:41:49] reality but everything has a price and
[04:41:52] sweet dreams are no exception in the end
[04:41:55] the dream world was unable to alleviate
[04:41:57] the suffering of prisoners in reality
[04:42:00] one of the prisoners Broke Free from the
[04:42:02] IPC shackles and fought for
[04:42:05] freedom he is
[04:42:08] hanu my god of dreamville Great
[04:42:11] Peacemaker hu the goat faithful
[04:42:13] companion of The
[04:42:15] Underdogs cool grunting
[04:42:20] noises so the character hanu is based on
[04:42:22] a real life
[04:42:25] person history is always
[04:42:27] WR however it's undeniable that Clocky
[04:42:31] is an animation that draws from penton's
[04:42:33] actual
[04:42:34] history these characters not only exist
[04:42:37] in dreamville but also in the distant
[04:42:40] past once once you realize this you'll
[04:42:43] understand why we're
[04:42:46] here wait
[04:42:48] what there are so many members of The
[04:42:51] Blood Hound family around
[04:42:53] here they just received a lockdown order
[04:42:56] supposedly from Sunday himself who knows
[04:43:00] what it's
[04:43:01] for
[04:43:04] [ __ ] so many of
[04:43:07] them I've never seen anything like this
[04:43:09] even when they're tracking down SU
[04:43:11] [Music]
[04:43:13] suspects we don't need to go in we don't
[04:43:15] want to draw any unwanted attention
[04:43:17] inside we can just talk here let's find
[04:43:20] a quiet spot and continue our
[04:43:22] conversation sir yes
[04:43:24] sir view here is great right including
[04:43:27] Clocky if all the characters in the
[04:43:30] animation are based on characters in
[04:43:34] reality then clock's counterpart is
[04:43:37] definitely the watch maker in the
[04:43:40] animation he's hu's partner and one of
[04:43:42] the founders of
[04:43:44] dreamville does that mean the watchmaker
[04:43:47] was personally involved in that war and
[04:43:50] sided with asdon oh yes it was a
[04:43:53] Monumental War for Freedom hunu fought
[04:43:56] alongside a mly crew of massed fools
[04:44:00] nameless history fiction lists mourning
[04:44:04] actors Omen
[04:44:06] vanguards even visitors from Beyond the
[04:44:09] sky in the end they emerged Victorious
[04:44:13] among them was the person who would
[04:44:14] eventually be known as the
[04:44:17] watchmaker but if you do the math
[04:44:20] doesn't that mean the watchmaker was
[04:44:22] around for several centuries how is
[04:44:25] march doing the one doing the math I'm
[04:44:26] not sure but M was already the
[04:44:28] watchmaker when I met him so maybe he
[04:44:31] inherited the
[04:44:32] title how old are you now Mr
[04:44:38] Officer I'm 13 okay
[04:44:41] all right no way not even
[04:44:44] close hunu freed the frontier prison but
[04:44:48] peace still eluded with limited
[04:44:52] resources outside world and internal
[04:44:55] conflicts between major prison districts
[04:44:57] the future of oano was uncertain he's a
[04:45:00] juicer it wasn't until the watch maker
[04:45:02] approached the family with the idea of
[04:45:05] turning the prison into the planet of
[04:45:07] festivities that pentacon finally gained
[04:45:10] its name
[04:45:12] Glory thus he became known as the father
[04:45:16] of
[04:45:17] pentacon but take back what he said
[04:45:19] about his M he's not [ __ ] 13 family
[04:45:22] he's a bartender said you were His
[04:45:24] companion so that means
[04:45:28] you no I'm Not His
[04:45:32] companion but rather one of his many
[04:45:35] children but I am indeed a
[04:45:38] traitor not to the family
[04:45:41] but you the [ __ ]
[04:45:44] male what did you do
[04:45:48] uhoh I did
[04:45:50] nothing and that's the worst betrayal of
[04:45:53] all just like you I had close
[04:45:56] companions we dedicated ourselves to
[04:45:59] pentacon but the oak family they set us
[04:46:03] up male was too old to protect his
[04:46:06] children anymore so we left the family
[04:46:10] to find our own path we were branded
[04:46:13] traitors of children it's literally
[04:46:15] Misha even though the true traitors were
[04:46:17] someone
[04:46:18] else while they continue to praise the
[04:46:21] watchmaker's name in the World Behind
[04:46:23] Closed Doors they condemn him on a
[04:46:25] pillar of
[04:46:27] Shame nevertheless we wanted to clear
[04:46:30] his name we intended to find the real
[04:46:33] traitor the one responsible for all this
[04:46:36] and restore Harmony to pentacon but we
[04:46:39] failed
[04:46:41] too much time had passed and the land of
[04:46:43] the dreams had become deeply
[04:46:46] corrupted after countless fruitless
[04:46:49] Pursuits I gave
[04:46:52] up like a lost dog the family accepted
[04:46:55] me and made me an officer supposedly as
[04:46:59] a form of
[04:47:00] forgiveness but it was actually a
[04:47:03] punishment since then I've been
[04:47:05] completely cut off from my partners and
[04:47:08] my
[04:47:09] past as for male
[04:47:12] I heard he died in obscurity in a place
[04:47:15] where no one could find
[04:47:17] him that's when I realized that the
[04:47:20] pentacon I once knew would never return
[04:47:24] we're truly sorry for what
[04:47:26] happened but this is not the end of the
[04:47:29] story
[04:47:31] right H apparently someone has inherited
[04:47:36] the title of the watchmaker and has been
[04:47:38] secretly working against the family all
[04:47:40] this
[04:47:44] time that's my goat unfortunately after
[04:47:47] all these years I have no idea who that
[04:47:50] person is or if they're even
[04:47:53] real it's Misha maybe not I don't
[04:47:56] [ __ ] know but they have the same name
[04:47:58] I just have one lead and I'm going on
[04:47:59] the one lead all in [ __ ] it I'm I'm
[04:48:02] [ __ ] aventurine I'm going all in I
[04:48:04] believe the girl's death must be
[04:48:06] connected to the watchmaker's Legacy and
[04:48:09] at the end of all these Mysteries we
[04:48:11] will find the answers we are seeking if
[04:48:14] it really is male's ghost I want to meet
[04:48:19] him if only for the last
[04:48:21] time for those who despise me could form
[04:48:24] a line from here all the way to the
[04:48:26] entrance of the hotel but those willing
[04:48:28] to look me in the eye and hear me
[04:48:31] out let's just say there won't be many
[04:48:35] I've told you all I know is a sign of
[04:48:38] gratitude thank you for listening to
[04:48:40] this old dog bark and all H uh something
[04:48:45] just happened at the theme park
[04:48:47] SS now if you'll excuse me good luck to
[04:48:50] all of you how
[04:48:53] ironic what's so different between the
[04:48:55] stows rejected by pentacon today and the
[04:48:59] dream Seekers once hailed as Pioneers
[04:49:02] several Amber eras
[04:49:06] ago Gallagher does have a troubled past
[04:49:09] it seems
[04:49:11] while Firefly's whereabouts remain a
[04:49:13] mystery his stories shed light on our
[04:49:16] suspicions about the true identity of
[04:49:18] the watchmaker his connection to the
[04:49:21] family and the power struggles hidden
[04:49:24] behind sweet dreams and
[04:49:28] death all that the family isn't all oh
[04:49:32] and that the family isn't all United as
[04:49:34] one and that death is related to the
[04:49:36] watchmaker and that Clocky is based on
[04:49:38] the watchmaker
[04:49:42] exactly Gallagher suggests that the real
[04:49:44] traitor is someone else that lines up
[04:49:48] with what we've gathered so far Firefly
[04:49:51] got involved in this mess because of the
[04:49:53] Legacy and now we're sure that
[04:49:55] aventurine accusations against Aaron are
[04:50:01] baseless you're really into Clocky huh
[04:50:04] speaking of which that Clocky who only
[04:50:07] reveals himself to you is quite
[04:50:09] intriguing it's a shame we've never met
[04:50:11] him since then okay now that we've
[04:50:14] confirmed a lot of our suspicions let's
[04:50:16] take a moment to think about the clues
[04:50:18] we have send a message to welt and see
[04:50:22] how things are going on his
[04:50:27] end oh can I ask a dumb question can I
[04:50:30] ask a dumb question I feel like I should
[04:50:32] know this by now because they mentioned
[04:50:34] it like 26 times but who the [ __ ] is the
[04:50:36] O
[04:50:38] family no spoilers past what we know

[04:51:24] worried about you they're just checking

[04:51:30] they've made some progress looks like
[04:51:32] we're about to enter the depths of dite
[04:51:34] PR oh I know this place it's been a
[04:51:36] smooth ride uhoh almost too smooth for a
[04:51:39] heavily guarded clears all these [ __ ]
[04:51:41] NPCs let's see if there's anyone waiting
[04:51:44] to greet us and lore welt is [ __ ]
[04:51:58] broken oh it's this [ __ ]
[04:52:04] puzzle something feels off a Grand
[04:52:08] Mansion like this and not a butler or
[04:52:09] servant in sight this door is open looks
[04:52:13] like we'll have just one
[04:52:15] moment just one moment acon draws her
[04:52:17] blade slightly within a moment her
[04:52:19] breath becomes impers
[04:52:21] light I've made myself less
[04:52:24] noticeable the crew can explain their
[04:52:26] presence as authorized by the family but
[04:52:29] I can't come up with any excuses for
[04:52:31] being
[04:52:32] here I see what an interesting technique
[04:52:40] transformation using Arron's okay I know
[04:52:42] what [ __ ] Arron's technique does
[04:52:51] buddy the model in the sand pit it's the
[04:52:55] golden hour the footprints here are
[04:52:58] different from the
[04:52:59] rest two sets
[04:53:02] of looks like Outsiders passed through
[04:53:05] here not long ago
[04:53:12] [ __ ] it we got the Gamba feeling
[04:53:17] lucky sorry I felt like
[04:53:20] gambing we did not win
[04:53:22] spoilers chest no
[04:53:30] chest well there aren't any people in
[04:53:32] this
[04:53:33] Mansion they the [ __ ] quite a few mimic
[04:53:35] guards to patrol this place
[04:53:38] oh okay I guess I can't technique that
[04:53:42] all together uh I don't know about this
[04:53:44] team C
[04:53:47] [Music]
[04:53:55] though spend
[04:53:57] freely free will or was destined for
[04:54:01] Oblivion I weep for the
[04:54:04] Departed it too shall fall I will
[04:54:07] dispatch you your end approaches
[04:54:18] why is blade here I don't [ __ ]
[04:54:23] know why
[04:54:25] not that's half the work on the Still
[04:54:28] Waters of Oblivion
[04:54:31] obliv I hope for an she's
[04:54:36] done another journey be destined for
[04:54:39] Oblivion
[04:54:44] sorry look it dropped something a
[04:54:47] note looks like instructions from the
[04:54:49] butler for the other
[04:54:51] servants seems like the mansion's entire
[04:54:54] Workforce were assigned other tasks
[04:54:56] before Robin's death it must have been a
[04:54:59] big project to require that much
[04:55:02] Manpower the Germany Festival perhaps
[04:55:06] but no matter what their main priorities
[04:55:08] are there should always be be someone
[04:55:10] left at the Mansion right so you're
[04:55:14] saying someone deliberately yeah it's a
[04:55:16] setup yeah but I don't know why the
[04:55:26] Trap stream
[04:55:30] foran no one here either there's a chest
[04:55:33] get the get the chest no one's around to
[04:55:35] entertain us let's make ourselves at
[04:55:39] home TR
[04:55:43] dear brother a letter from Robin how are
[04:55:46] you doing these days I intended to visit
[04:55:47] you uh my return but with the
[04:55:50] approaching TR Festival in your busy
[04:55:51] schedule I refrain from troubling you
[04:55:52] urgent matter it's my depend of
[04:55:54] experience dude
[04:55:58] Jesus um peuli change my
[04:56:01] [Music]
[04:56:02] voice my voice worsened over time and I
[04:56:05] even experienced periods of complete
[04:56:07] voice
[04:56:08] loss investigations
[04:56:10] a Discord lurking within us tainted my
[04:56:12] voice of
[04:56:13] Harmony I immediately realize that such
[04:56:16] levels of interference can only occur if
[04:56:18] either a powerful external force is
[04:56:19] pulling the strings or if a senior
[04:56:21] member of the family is involved
[04:56:22] unfortunately uh latter conclusion which
[04:56:25] means a member of the family is involved
[04:56:27] extremely alarming Discovery a traitor
[04:56:29] has emerged within the family it's
[04:56:32] highly likely that that one person is
[04:56:33] one of the four family heads I trust you
[04:56:35] implicitly dear brother with because of
[04:56:38] our promise within the The Horizon I
[04:56:39] feel this intends to impede its progress
[04:56:41] or even use the festival for some
[04:56:43] ulterior
[04:56:46] motive learn about the memories on death
[04:56:49] Meme and further inquiries believe that
[04:56:51] the culprit who directed it to cause a
[04:56:54] series of incidents is likely the afor
[04:56:56] mentioned traitor in the
[04:56:59] family given your heavy workload please
[04:57:01] take care of yourself Tarts strawberries
[04:57:05] size and sweetness mering cream
[04:57:08] cracknels from medicia
[04:57:11] May Zee be with us Robin as soon as I
[04:57:15] and the rest of the crew arrived in
[04:57:16] pentacon Mr Sunday and Robin showed up
[04:57:19] to greet us I remember hearing something
[04:57:23] unusual in her voice tra and family is
[04:57:27] one of the four heads Harmony had been
[04:57:28] tampered with
[04:57:29] somehow but as far as I know there
[04:57:32] aren't many entities capable of
[04:57:34] interfering with the power of paths
[04:57:37] meaning if there really is that
[04:57:41] I mean to is the real a tra of the
[04:57:43] family the person must hold a high
[04:57:45] position or possess right Sunday has
[04:57:47] been having such difficulty in catching
[04:57:48] the
[04:57:50] traitor there's an impostor Among
[04:57:56] Us bro are you [ __ ]
[04:58:09] [Music]
[04:58:20] the information about Robin Firefly and
[04:58:23] the other
[04:58:24] victims I don't see any commonalities
[04:58:27] among them looks like the rumor rumors
[04:58:30] were right death does seem to be
[04:58:32] targeting random victims and based on
[04:58:36] Sunday's
[04:58:37] notes he's no stranger to death he's
[04:58:40] just surprised that it has research wait
[04:58:42] let me wait wait can I reopen it wait
[04:58:43] wait let me reop no no no let me let me
[04:58:45] no no let me no let me look at it again
[04:58:49] oh my can I not look at it
[04:58:52] again hello can I not open it
[04:58:56] again did
[04:58:59] I this light
[04:59:01] cone is securely
[04:59:03] guarded it must hold some important
[04:59:06] memories baby suay according to Robin's
[04:59:09] interview despite having performed on so
[04:59:12] many Grand stages her favorite
[04:59:15] performance was a a pretend show she put
[04:59:18] on with her brother when they were just
[04:59:21] kids I wonder how their relationship
[04:59:23] what if Sunday okay disclaimer mute your
[04:59:26] mute the stream right now cuz there's no
[04:59:28] way this is the real like this is really
[04:59:30] what happened so mute the stream what if
[04:59:32] Sunday was like you know what sister I'm
[04:59:34] such a like big fan of yours that no one
[04:59:36] else should be able to hear your voice
[04:59:38] so he Fu he like removed her voice voice
[04:59:40] and was like now no one else can hear
[04:59:42] your voice that didn't happen I'm sorry
[04:59:45] there's a traitor it's not him growing
[04:59:46] up brings gains but SL
[04:59:50] losses yeah time is a way of smoothing
[04:59:53] things out or is it dreams of Youth will
[04:59:57] eventually Fade
[04:59:58] Away wait can I not reopen this [ __ ]
[05:00:01] okay GG stream four gleam of old
[05:00:06] [Music]
[05:00:08] blades to Sunday from a letter from
[05:00:13] alala that's not their name Alf Alpha oh
[05:00:17] wait it is um I've been informed about
[05:00:20] Robin and I why is alpha alpha funny I
[05:00:22] would like to express my deepest
[05:00:23] condolences I must remind
[05:00:27] you that you now hold the position of
[05:00:29] not only her elder brother but also the
[05:00:30] head of the oak
[05:00:33] family critical
[05:00:35] period
[05:00:37] death that while you that death is
[05:00:39] connected to the watchmaker I've met the
[05:00:41] watchmaker many times long before the
[05:00:43] dream master adopted you and your sister
[05:00:44] dream master adopted them and I have
[05:00:46] never found any evidence linking him to
[05:00:48] the memory Zone meme now that you are
[05:00:50] the head of the oak family it's
[05:00:51] essential that you assess the situation
[05:00:53] objectively and consider the bigger
[05:00:55] picture it is unwise to allocate all of
[05:00:57] ped's resources and Manpower for the
[05:00:59] sake of a personal Vendetta man [ __ ] you
[05:01:01] it's Robin I hope alafa dies to the
[05:01:04] Charmy Festival on the horizon and the
[05:01:06] watchmaker's guests uh the I barely hold
[05:01:10] in neither you nor I could face the
[05:01:13] severe consequences if dominicus arrival
[05:01:15] is delayed therefore I urge you to
[05:01:17] control your emotions and fulfill your
[05:01:19] responsibilities as for the matter of
[05:01:20] Robin there will be time to pursue it
[05:01:23] once the festival
[05:01:25] concludes his sister just died and he's
[05:01:27] addressing the matter of Robin at the
[05:01:29] end instead of at the start alphalpha is
[05:01:31] a little [ __ ] I hope he she or they
[05:01:33] [ __ ] neither the dream master of
[05:01:35] pentacon nor this old OD is happy I
[05:01:38] don't even like Sunday
[05:01:40] performance they don't seem to care much
[05:01:42] about death instead they're more
[05:01:45] concerned about the Charmy Festival in
[05:01:47] the watch maker maybe the other family
[05:01:49] heads don't think death is a big
[05:01:51] deal one thing's for sure there's a lot
[05:01:55] of internal conflict within the family
[05:01:57] and everybody has their own
[05:02:01] agenda why not I don't I don't mind
[05:02:04] Sunday but I feel like he's doing
[05:02:05] adventuring dirty and aventurine is the
[05:02:07] goat look at him
[05:02:11] he gambles gambling is good no it isn't

[05:03:10] see the [ __ ]
[05:03:13] thread Mr Sunday has done some serious
[05:03:16] research on his
[05:03:17] suspects this Traer must have been
[05:03:20] causing trouble for the family for a
[05:03:21] they all seem to be insiders but I
[05:03:24] haven't met oh I didn't read their jobs
[05:03:26] oops wait these
[05:03:28] characteristics what is
[05:03:30] it no nothing wait can I open it again

[05:04:21] dream

[05:04:35] DRS I'm not sure thinking things at
[05:04:38] first I thought there was like flackers
[05:04:39] is at work but now it doesn't seem like
[05:04:40] that this traitor really exists could
[05:04:43] they be responsible for Firefly and
[05:04:45] Robin's deaths perhaps that's why Sunday
[05:04:48] is taking this matter so
[05:04:50] seriously that's all for now nothing
[05:04:53] more note noteworthy before coming here
[05:04:57] I had all sorts of scenarios in my head
[05:04:59] about dealing with the family I did not
[05:05:03] expect an empty
[05:05:05] Mansion watch out someone's approaching
[05:05:07] uh oh it's the meme again
[05:05:10] I don't think trespassing on forbidden
[05:05:12] areas is the way to be a guest Mr Yang
[05:05:16] and Aaron the galaxy ranger yo Aaron
[05:05:21] could literally use her technique this
[05:05:23] guy's dead nobody came to greet us so we
[05:05:25] entered without permission I hope you
[05:05:28] can forgive us but even if there's no
[05:05:30] one to greet you you should wait for the
[05:05:32] host don't you agree shut the [ __ ] up
[05:05:35] Sunday Saturday's better Friday's better
[05:05:39] as far as I know the crew has officially
[05:05:41] accepted the family's commission so
[05:05:43] coming here will be unnecessary for
[05:05:46] you on the contrary that's exactly why
[05:05:49] we're here to ask you about the case and
[05:05:52] gather more information we don't want
[05:05:55] any loose
[05:05:58] ends well since you've come with
[05:06:01] Goodwill I have no reason to show you
[05:06:03] the door thanks hunde rest assured he
[05:06:06] hasn't figured out that we went through
[05:06:08] those documents
[05:06:10] while the truth remains a mystery I'm
[05:06:13] getting close to it I assure you that
[05:06:16] the traitor will soon pay the price say
[05:06:20] it louder Aaron she was lowkey yapping
[05:06:23] in front of him I have a question for
[05:06:26] you if you don't mind how did the family
[05:06:29] come to the conclusion that the murderer
[05:06:31] was within the
[05:06:32] family with all due respect it's in the
[05:06:36] ipc's interest to wreak havoc before the
[05:06:38] charmony festival and the family has
[05:06:41] every reason to suspect the ipc's
[05:06:43] involvement well other family heads
[05:06:46] share the same suspicions as you but in
[05:06:49] my opinion the true murderer would never
[05:06:52] have drawn as much attention as that
[05:06:54] Ambassador did not to mention I
[05:06:57] personally Shackled him a while
[05:06:59] ago however I'll give you a suggestion
[05:07:02] regarding your suspicions Mr Yang you
[05:07:06] should be more cautious of
[05:07:07] aventurine while the wicked K can't
[05:07:10] break through high walls they can plunge
[05:07:13] their evil dagger into why would I be
[05:07:14] suspicious about aventurine although I
[05:07:16] feel like we've been at this quest for
[05:07:18] like 4 hours not to be a metag gamer of
[05:07:20] the quest but the version preview of
[05:07:22] this very
[05:07:25] uh version uh had a venturine In Like A
[05:07:28] Boss form so I feel like that has to
[05:07:31] happen at some point but like I mean I
[05:07:33] couldn't skip that okay all good a
[05:07:34] businessman not some
[05:07:36] philanthropist but right now he's out
[05:07:39] there handing out his wealth on the
[05:07:41] streets and he went to the clock Studios
[05:07:43] theme park all by himself who knows what
[05:07:46] kind of scheme he's cooking
[05:07:49] up while the family is dedicated to
[05:07:51] keeping our guests safe it might be wise
[05:07:55] for you to stay
[05:07:56] alert you never know what unexpected
[05:08:00] troubles could arise I don't trust
[05:08:02] Sunday he is making the colon 3 face
[05:08:06] though thank you for the raid gecko
[05:08:10] entered safe Zone to AO hotline tip
[05:08:14] there was a major breakthrough in the
[05:08:15] shocking edio aventurine case the
[05:08:19] suspect has been arrested wait Eggo is
[05:08:21] that his first name
[05:08:26] egzo this fraud case has been linked to
[05:08:29] many departments within the inter Asal
[05:08:31] peace Corporation and the what the [ __ ]
[05:08:34] is eggy a large drain in man and res
[05:08:38] resulting in the the IPC taking a
[05:08:41] massive
[05:08:43] loss a planet
[05:08:49] oh what's his real name oh it's like
[05:08:51] Ruka Dada Ka Kasha
[05:08:53] kavada Ka Kasha kavada K yeah the one
[05:08:57] with the K
[05:08:58] Kaka Vada K
[05:09:04] yeah [ __ ] Basha kabasha case's main
[05:09:08] suspect origin Ates from seonia 4 and is
[05:09:11] one of the survivors of the second
[05:09:14] kataka Ain Extinction event who does not
[05:09:17] carry an Interstellar Refugee travel
[05:09:26] permit oh it's not Auto playing I was
[05:09:28] like as per Strategic investment
[05:09:31] Department had Diamond sentiments the
[05:09:33] IPC has appropriately relocated the
[05:09:35] suspect in the spirit of the charter and
[05:09:38] will continue
[05:09:39] Pro's name is Diamond sorry as to the
[05:09:42] motive of the
[05:09:45] suspect oh what pretty
[05:09:48] eyes tell
[05:09:50] me do they shine in the
[05:09:53] dark bro that what color are her eyes if
[05:09:56] I did I'd sell them in a
[05:10:00] heartbeat you don't know how many people
[05:10:03] long for your eyes to be closed
[05:10:07] forever as a servant
[05:10:10] you should not resist your
[05:10:12] master yet you went and killed that man
[05:10:16] anyway based of
[05:10:20] venturine no lawyer has the audacity to
[05:10:22] defend you I would perhaps you ought to
[05:10:26] represent hey you're going to jail but I
[05:10:28] can represent
[05:10:31] you not difficult but definitely
[05:10:36] pointless you're pretty confident on
[05:10:38] your eloquence
[05:10:40] did you also think that when you lied to
[05:10:42] the intelligence you
[05:10:44] [Music]
[05:10:46] guilt ask and you shall receive you
[05:10:50] wanted the perfect construction material
[05:10:53] all I did was offer a
[05:10:55] possibility it was just a small wager if
[05:10:58] your luck holds out the IPC will dig
[05:11:01] something up from the Golden Sands of
[05:11:03] edzo maybe even the sand King's
[05:11:07] remains pity you're look has run out
[05:11:11] I'll admit
[05:11:12] that what I'm more curious about though
[05:11:16] is why such a grand scheme failed to
[05:11:19] benefit anyone in the end including the
[05:11:22] perpetrator
[05:11:25] himself oh Madam I already have what I
[05:11:28] want to be brought before you for the
[05:11:31] next high stak's
[05:11:34] gamble then let's talk about the second
[05:11:37] gamble tell me
[05:11:40] what are you prepared to wager this time
[05:11:42] I'm prepared to wager everything Jade
[05:11:45] since the moment I laid eyes on you my
[05:11:49] life I bet you won't send me to The
[05:11:56] Gallows what do you want
[05:11:59] then I want your Lenor to meet with me I
[05:12:04] have something to say and then what I
[05:12:07] want cash
[05:12:12] it can't be that simple can it it is
[05:12:15] that
[05:12:16] simple 30
[05:12:18] Tas the remain that's not a lot my
[05:12:22] market value I feel like her necklace
[05:12:25] like her her bracelet necklace that has
[05:12:26] to be like at least like a thousand
[05:12:29] tboss no
[05:12:32] less with this money I'll climb to even
[05:12:34] greater Heights than you grasp even more
[05:12:38] riches than you
[05:12:40] you I wager you won't give me this
[05:12:43] chance which is why you should call him
[05:12:50] here interesting a Pity Diamond won't
[05:12:53] see you no one gets to see him from here
[05:12:58] on out I am Diamond's representative and
[05:13:02] I will decide on his behalf okay you're
[05:13:06] wrong flirty Tas I'll give you you that
[05:13:10] and much more than that wealth
[05:13:16] status
[05:13:18] power the IPC will give you whatever you
[05:13:22] want even what you don't
[05:13:26] want
[05:13:29] kavasa a good name but unfortunately
[05:13:33] destined to be buried in the dirt yo you
[05:13:37] though you deserve to live to create
[05:13:41] even more wealth oh that's how they
[05:13:43] chose his new name he's like yeah let's
[05:13:46] go on an adventure and then she's like
[05:13:49] adventurine go pick the clothes you like
[05:13:53] never mind then choose your desired
[05:13:55] identity and
[05:13:58] then use them well
[05:14:02] child may your plans never suffer
[05:14:07] failure life is like a long-term
[05:14:10] investment those who choose correctly do
[05:14:13] the correct things reach the correct
[05:14:17] outcomes show the world their
[05:14:19] value people can't always make the right
[05:14:22] choices in their
[05:14:24] lives but luck has always been on my
[05:14:27] side I've never lost is it because Gyra
[05:14:31] blesses
[05:14:33] me if that's the case she must also be
[05:14:36] looking upon me right now
[05:14:40] My Success is
[05:14:42] inevitable
[05:14:44] but what
[05:14:46] then even if I overcome this difficult
[05:14:50] trial what would come
[05:14:54] next what awaits me after this glorious
[05:14:57] gamble an even more glorious one
[05:15:00] probably will I return triumphant with
[05:15:03] unending riches after countless
[05:15:06] successes or
[05:15:09] will I encounter
[05:15:12] failure never to
[05:15:17] return I'm pretty sure you already have
[05:15:20] some ideas lowly
[05:15:30] Gambler
[05:15:32] what
[05:15:37] what okay I was like I I felt like it

[05:21:36] you still doing here well youve known
[05:21:38] all along the family truly showed
[05:21:41] leniency to everyone who came seeking
[05:21:43] help why would there be a need for such
[05:21:46] high walls and deep Moon that's a good
[05:21:49] point future me however people don't see
[05:21:52] it like that especially since the flavor
[05:21:55] of the drink syrup is so
[05:21:58] alluring you will receive no charity on
[05:22:01] Pentagon and relying on your own
[05:22:04] strength alone to top all high
[05:22:07] walls not not a likely
[05:22:10] fate which is why once you step into the
[05:22:14] hotel you remove your high hat and beg
[05:22:19] everyone you come across for
[05:22:21] help like a hyena scavaging for scraps
[05:22:25] in the
[05:22:27] desert because you know that
[05:22:29] opportunities are
[05:22:31] fleeting okay well when you put it like
[05:22:34] that even ratios of teeny peacock
[05:22:37] analogy sounds pleasant
[05:22:40] ratio's what well you know how rare it
[05:22:41] is for me to give you the Straight Dope
[05:22:44] so listen while you
[05:22:46] can it's good timing that you mentioned
[05:22:48] the doctor I'm especially fond of what
[05:22:51] you and he have in common the
[05:22:55] conspires
[05:22:58] calculations especially the part about
[05:23:00] the finale a magnificent Act of
[05:23:03] betrayal oh when everyone thinks this
[05:23:06] way who would even suspect that there
[05:23:08] was another trap you've meticulously
[05:23:13] devised go on tell me I'm right you know
[05:23:18] who you really are Mr Cavalier Gambler a
[05:23:21] tight over
[05:23:23] cautious massive inferiority
[05:23:26] complex you've won so much and you're
[05:23:29] still so afraid of
[05:23:32] losing they only see your big bets your
[05:23:35] bravado the Full House the street blush
[05:23:39] they don't know the other hand is below
[05:23:42] the table clutching your
[05:23:46] chips for dear life yeah cuz he's a
[05:23:51] gambler it's a heck of an act no wonder
[05:23:54] the tavern sent you an invite you're a
[05:23:57] natural kid you don't stop at fooling
[05:23:59] the audience you fool yourself
[05:24:03] too well the best way to prevent others
[05:24:06] from seeing your true colors is is first
[05:24:09] being able to fool
[05:24:13] yourself of course I know you all too
[05:24:18] well but it's
[05:24:20] strange why did you decline that
[05:24:23] invitation you had the chance to embrace
[05:24:25] Elation was that not what you most
[05:24:28] wanted but you chose the IPC
[05:24:31] instead for the
[05:24:34] preservation I doubt it do you even have

[05:33:20] my is
[05:33:24] this oh the
[05:33:26] job a
[05:33:29] topaz what is this doing
[05:33:36] here what the Des Cornerstone wrench out
[05:33:39] of your hearts
[05:33:40] so I was merely curious why it was
[05:33:46] here wait let me Google
[05:33:54] something aventurine is a type of
[05:33:57] quartz I
[05:34:01] see is just like IPC lore cuz there we
[05:34:05] have topaz we have Jade we have
[05:34:07] aventurine
[05:34:09] why is it just name
[05:34:11] quartz maybe that winged guy put it
[05:34:16] here you you just realized okay I mean I
[05:34:20] knew the other two but I didn't know
[05:34:21] [ __ ] aventurine was
[05:34:23] a stone
[05:34:32] diamond okay the cornerstone's Hue is
[05:34:35] the same as the radiance of H
[05:34:39] body I've got to get it to you I've
[05:34:41] heard a lot of baloney but that lie
[05:34:44] deserves a prize for sheer
[05:34:46] nerve if he were just a little bit
[05:34:50] smarter The Jig would have been up right
[05:34:56] there this is just bait true of course
[05:35:01] that's why Rio's betrayal was one of the
[05:35:02] keys to your plan I have to say that
[05:35:05] doctor's acting wasb true or maybe he
[05:35:10] wasn't acting at all oh all the better
[05:35:13] for you Sunday didn't become head of the
[05:35:15] oak family by acting
[05:35:17] sloppy he's obsessed with
[05:35:19] control you have to give him enough
[05:35:21] detail to satisfy his meticulous nature
[05:35:24] but not so much that he gets
[05:35:28] suspicious meanwhile alam's plan was
[05:35:30] I'll just get
[05:35:31] caught sorry which is why you had ratio
[05:35:34] seeking out and leak the plan on purpose
[05:35:37] to prevent the other party from
[05:35:39] suspecting anything the until you gave
[05:35:41] to ratio was all true we spoke the same
[05:35:44] to
[05:35:47] Sunday finally Sunday took the bait
[05:35:51] found me the Cornerstone and before you
[05:35:53] know
[05:35:58] it everyone's distracted enough for you
[05:36:01] to steal the third Stone right off from
[05:36:03] under them huh
[05:36:08] why don't you stop rumaging through my
[05:36:12] mind your
[05:36:15] mind it's our mind you're me and I'm
[05:36:21] you the best way to prevent others from
[05:36:24] seeing your true colors is to First be
[05:36:27] able to fool
[05:36:29] yourself really you can't even fool
[05:36:33] yourself you just got lucky this time
[05:36:38] bless the other Corner Sunday's hands
[05:36:41] rather beautiful
[05:36:43] green just like you
[05:36:46] smooth
[05:36:48] cunning tell
[05:36:50] me what's it
[05:36:53] name why are you even asking me must I
[05:36:57] do all the
[05:36:59] work Avenger is the stone of luck and
[05:37:02] trickery that's what she said when you
[05:37:05] received the stone wasn't it
[05:37:07] this type of stone isn't rare but its
[05:37:10] Hue is very similar to a certain gem in
[05:37:14] fact it's often used as a
[05:37:17] substitute and that more precious gem
[05:37:22] is
[05:37:26] Jade even Sunday can't tell the
[05:37:28] difference I see looks like Jade can be
[05:37:31] substituted for aventurine
[05:37:34] too sauce for the goose
[05:37:39] aventurine topaz
[05:37:42] Jade three Elites Three Corner who Okay
[05:37:48] sense offered their
[05:37:52] everything you're even more united than
[05:37:55] the
[05:37:57] family as I've said before three chips
[05:38:00] are sufficient All or
[05:38:03] Nothing but will it be the former or the
[05:38:06] latter
[05:38:09] we'll find out soon
[05:38:12] enough so where's the real aventurine
[05:38:15] Stone take it out let's have a
[05:38:20] look suddenly you don't know where it is
[05:38:24] I just want to hear you say it after all
[05:38:27] it really does resemble its
[05:38:32] owner As You Wish then they never went
[05:38:37] anywhere
[05:38:38] they're right where they belong do you
[05:38:40] think he hit it like where the [ __ ]
[05:38:42] the chess player hid the the like
[05:38:44] cheating these cheap
[05:38:47] bubbles you smashed the aventurine stone
[05:38:50] before you
[05:38:52] left oh just look at
[05:38:56] it
[05:38:58] shattered just like your life poor thing
[05:39:03] a humble Pebble coated in the most
[05:39:05] lustrous Sheen
[05:39:08] I take it back this thing is far more
[05:39:11] precious than your
[05:39:13] life you're absolutely clear about the
[05:39:16] consequences of doing this blasphemy
[05:39:18] against clip off's body you think the
[05:39:21] IPC will let you get off scott
[05:39:25] free well Diamond has always been all
[05:39:28] about results as long as I can create
[05:39:30] value far beyond the cost the ends
[05:39:33] justify the means
[05:39:37] how else would the family be fooled if
[05:39:39] there was no price to pay it doesn't
[05:39:42] matter even smash to smithin the
[05:39:46] preservation Cornerstone can still be
[05:39:48] used its effect may be greatly
[05:39:50] diminished but it's enough for
[05:39:54] me now I'm really
[05:39:57] curious why does every step you take
[05:39:59] involve Reckless risks and the choices
[05:40:01] you prepare for yourself always come
[05:40:03] with a strong impulse for
[05:40:05] self-destruction bro aren't you me you
[05:40:07] should know this do you truly believe
[05:40:09] that the greater the risk the greater
[05:40:10] the
[05:40:11] rewards I wouldn't have guessed you'd be
[05:40:13] so loyal to the
[05:40:15] IPC there is so much you don't
[05:40:18] see which is also why you'll never see
[05:40:21] how I'll win it
[05:40:24] all that is if you can do what it
[05:40:31] takes okay I'll just have to wait and
[05:40:34] see
[05:40:35] then the Cornerstone is gone another
[05:40:39] illusion of the harmony for the GLE of

[05:47:09] hand these are manacles on
[05:47:13] you that man gave you your first job and
[05:47:17] you made your first PT of
[05:47:19] gold I remember it all too well you
[05:47:22] wrapped that iron chain around your fist
[05:47:26] for that is the only tool you could find
[05:47:28] then in that
[05:47:31] maze shut
[05:47:33] up oh you don't wish to face your p
[05:47:38] unwilling to admit that your life is
[05:47:40] worth only 60
[05:47:42] Tas well from what I see you refuse to
[05:47:46] confront it because it only proves your
[05:47:49] weakness How could a weak person take
[05:47:51] such daring risk
[05:47:55] true how could I be weak if I can gamble
[05:48:00] big
[05:48:02] aventurine you love the thrill of danger
[05:48:06] but you refused to let go of meaningless
[05:48:09] sentiments even in this beautiful dream
[05:48:12] the only thing you dare allow
[05:48:15] yourself is death in your hands those
[05:48:19] who follow you could have become Joker
[05:48:21] cards they're far more useful that way
[05:48:24] it's not like this is the only place the
[05:48:26] family ever cut Corners you could have
[05:48:28] had tons of action if you weren't so all
[05:48:30] or
[05:48:31] nothing all it takes is a meager
[05:48:34] sacrifice
[05:48:36] bet opal would have resolved this
[05:48:38] without a fuss a Pity you're not him op
[05:48:42] wouldn't be in this state if you could
[05:48:43] just get with the
[05:48:45] program and why couldn't
[05:48:47] you out of professional Integrity those
[05:48:51] techniques you mentioned are highly
[05:48:53] efficient but it's not that I don't know
[05:48:55] about them it's more like I couldn't
[05:48:57] care
[05:48:58] less get it what fun is it if the fight
[05:49:01] isn't fair
[05:49:04] fair you assume your opponents would
[05:49:06] fight fair in the first place the odds
[05:49:09] are obviously not in your favor so how
[05:49:13] are you just breezing by but did that
[05:49:16] mask Fool's words awaken something in
[05:49:19] you answer that could turn everything
[05:49:22] upside
[05:49:25] down everything you mean it could make
[05:49:28] all the cards on the table
[05:49:31] just
[05:49:33] disappear W that's cheating
[05:49:37] madic trick if these leaves could be
[05:49:39] brought back the water we could drink
[05:49:41] they bloom into new
[05:49:53] flowers okay fine I'll go there
[05:50:07] your expression right now is hard to put
[05:50:08] into
[05:50:09] words the lucky charm mama left you is
[05:50:12] made from gold why did you never
[05:50:14] consider selling it you obviously could
[05:50:17] have lived a normal life like big sis
[05:50:19] that way looking back that was the
[05:50:22] better choice Mama only left us with two
[05:50:25] pieces of jewelry a necklace and a lucky
[05:50:29] charm there won't ever be a third
[05:50:33] piece that's what you always say but you
[05:50:36] actually you regret it don't you that
[05:50:39] you didn't
[05:50:40] s you can zip it if
[05:50:43] there's I know you must remember what
[05:50:47] big sis told you you're a child blessed
[05:50:50] by GATRA triclops and can lead the clan
[05:50:54] to happiness so always remember to
[05:50:57] protect yourself and never resent the
[05:50:59] pain and poverty you're going through
[05:51:03] the words still ring in your ears don't

[06:16:48] to the astral Express aventurine prior
[06:16:52] accusation was based on nothing more
[06:16:54] than his own subjectivity which is why
[06:16:58] before we continue working together he
[06:17:01] has a duty to explain himself you want
[06:17:04] to
[06:17:05] create a situation where all three
[06:17:08] parties are
[06:17:10] present there must be some deeper
[06:17:13] meaning behind aventurine
[06:17:16] actions I suspect he's been aware of
[06:17:19] penacon secret from the beginning and
[06:17:22] has been continuously strategizing to
[06:17:25] unveil in that sense the astral
[06:17:29] Express's role in his plans would be
[06:17:32] imperative in the worst case scenario I
[06:17:35] feel like well he's like smart and he
[06:17:37] like knows what's going on but it takes
[06:17:38] him to like the end of the quest to
[06:17:39] figure it out it's like the nukes about
[06:17:42] to detonate and he's like ah there's a
[06:17:45] nuke assuming things do escalate to that
[06:17:49] stage having an extra Ally is a good
[06:17:51] insurance policy penone has numerous
[06:17:55] factions and the State of Affairs is
[06:17:58] sign tweeted it's
[06:18:00] [ __ ] and the C
[06:18:02] Jo bro start just twet like eight what

[06:18:37] mind this just Robin
[06:18:40] stuff ow [ __ ] sorry sorry Robin this
[06:18:44] is so loud uh assuming things do
[06:18:49] escalate to the
[06:18:52] stage I for allies to get a CH policy P
[06:18:55] has new factions and the State of
[06:18:56] Affairs is significantly more intricate
[06:18:57] than that of the bog of bog and the
[06:19:01] sanjo but we must meet me
[06:19:06] me is that a word what the [ __ ] is meat
[06:19:09] but like with a
[06:19:11] t uh I am the bone of my bat stellon is
[06:19:15] my body and trailblaze is my blood

[06:19:21] good vibe to it's a good vibe yo March
[06:19:25] who taught you that
[06:19:26] word the path ahead is fraught with
[06:19:30] danger but what's trailblazing without a
[06:19:34] little danger

[06:20:13] definitely use dude this Quest started
[06:20:15] with Sam where the [ __ ] did Sam go so we
[06:20:17] still have to see Sam and we still have

[06:47:25] expecting
[06:47:27] uh-oh oh [ __ ]
[06:47:30] mity is it
[06:47:34] perhaps to you I am just an emanator
[06:47:38] who's hiding her identity
[06:47:42] but the sleeping and shapeless never
[06:47:45] glance at
[06:47:47] anyone they have no face no form and
[06:47:51] even less of a will to
[06:47:53] speak the nihility envelops everyone
[06:47:57] equally only some who have gone under
[06:48:00] their Shadow can go farther tainting
[06:48:03] themselves with more
[06:48:05] nihility that's
[06:48:09] all that's
[06:48:11] all my friend you really leave me at a
[06:48:14] loss for
[06:48:16] words
[06:48:19] so is this my final
[06:48:23] destination the Land of the Dead this is
[06:48:26] all but a fleeting dream one of the
[06:48:29] thousands of manifestations of a ex
[06:48:32] under the watchful eye of nihility we
[06:48:35] momentarily linger here before moving on
[06:48:38] to our own
[06:48:40] paths it seems that my death has already
[06:48:43] been determined oh [ __ ] even if you wish
[06:48:46] for it oh POG I can't promise you
[06:48:50] anything now that you've accomplished
[06:48:52] your goal I think you can be a little
[06:48:54] more
[06:48:57] forthcoming what do you
[06:48:59] mean your performance at the theme park
[06:49:02] was wonderful and
[06:49:03] grandiose a simple yet practical
[06:49:06] technique that fooled almost
[06:49:10] everyone no one would have ever thought
[06:49:13] that you would have gone to such lengths
[06:49:15] even staking your life just to prove a
[06:49:18] fact that had seemingly been disproved
[06:49:20] long ago real death does not exist in
[06:49:24] penton's
[06:49:27] Dreamscape
[06:49:30] true why would I do so is still chilling
[06:49:33] There's Hope because this is the only
[06:49:35] way you can uncover a secret that is
[06:49:37] even more unspeakable than the serial
[06:49:40] murders to use this dream death to get
[06:49:44] there to that Promised Land people
[06:49:47] constantly seek in this Grand Gathering
[06:49:52] penacon the legacy of the watch maker
[06:49:56] the true land of
[06:49:58] Exile I mean Exile is not bad it gives
[06:50:00] energy to your whole team but for a
[06:50:01] fourstar set I'd rather use structor
[06:50:03] usually or like no blast or something
[06:50:05] but it's fine how did you find out I
[06:50:08] never imagined that something I learned
[06:50:10] about
[06:50:11] unexpectedly would become the key to
[06:50:13] connecting
[06:50:15] everything it's that person's identity
[06:50:18] isn't
[06:50:20] it watch [ __ ] no it can't be actually
[06:50:23] never mind I see you're in the
[06:50:26] no they're probably yapping about
[06:50:28] [ __ ] let's just say I'd put money on
[06:50:30] the
[06:50:31] possibility the murder isn't nearly
[06:50:33] enough to disrupt business as usual even
[06:50:36] if there were one or two murders on
[06:50:39] pentacon most people wouldn't be
[06:50:41] personally
[06:50:42] affected and that won't create anyways
[06:50:45] who okay they're probably talking about
[06:50:47] the head of the family that's the
[06:50:48] traitor I thought they're talking about
[06:50:49] Sam but I don't think they're talking
[06:50:50] about Sam there probably the [ __ ]
[06:50:51] family person and there's no way they're
[06:50:54] talking about Misha yet cuz the [ __ ]
[06:50:56] the Mel like cone was the patch after so
[06:51:00] I don't think there's lore about him yet
[06:51:01] but maybe this dream of theirs isn't a
[06:51:03] boundless
[06:51:04] sea it's a lonely island the family used
[06:51:08] the harmony to build a high wall and
[06:51:10] isolate them from the vast and
[06:51:12] treacherous ocean of the outside
[06:51:17] world that barrier they build keeps
[06:51:19] death out but it also keeps the secrets
[06:51:22] that are lost in that watery Abyss from
[06:51:25] floating to the
[06:51:26] surface in a beautiful dream free of
[06:51:30] suffering who would want to go go
[06:51:32] fishing for those
[06:51:35] Secrets no one unless haha unless unless
[06:51:40] someone goes to the other side of the
[06:51:42] barrier and lives to tell the
[06:51:45] tale someone already
[06:51:48] has I got the idea early on chewing on
[06:51:52] that masked Fool's little
[06:51:54] hint if a mute isn't someone who cannot
[06:51:57] make a sound then it has to be someone
[06:52:00] who cannot speak
[06:52:03] oh someone who survived the treacherous
[06:52:06] depths but is unable to take the stage
[06:52:09] and speak the
[06:52:12] truth I'm happy to know she's safe and
[06:52:14] sound and still on
[06:52:17] Pentagon oh
[06:52:19] hint is that not
[06:52:21] proof well proof is the one thing I
[06:52:24] don't have the only thing that can prove
[06:52:27] these
[06:52:30] conjectures is for the family to come
[06:52:32] clean
[06:52:33] and with the way they buttered up these
[06:52:35] I still don't know who the second one is
[06:52:37] though it seems pretty clear they're
[06:52:39] intent on covering their TR like it's
[06:52:41] Robin plus one but you don't need proof
[06:52:44] to have a suspicion and for me suspicion
[06:52:47] is enough sus I didn't need to find the
[06:52:51] memory Zone meme I just needed for
[06:52:53] someone to kill me like it killed that
[06:52:55] silverhair girl you don't sound very
[06:52:59] confident to me going out of your way to
[06:53:01] make City wide broadcast in an attempt
[06:53:04] to involve more
[06:53:05] people you are simply betting on the
[06:53:08] possibility of someone being able to
[06:53:10] break down the
[06:53:11] barrier you're very lucky that fate has
[06:53:14] decided to let us cross
[06:53:16] paths I happen to be equipped with a
[06:53:19] very sharp blade sharp enough to slice
[06:53:22] through the veil of
[06:53:24] dreams I can also carve the Harmony's
[06:53:27] brand off of
[06:53:30] you well I still don't get how the
[06:53:32] [ __ ] Veil thing works
[06:53:36] though the
[06:53:38] um I mean
[06:53:40] whatever you possess great
[06:53:43] cunning deliberately setting us up to be
[06:53:45] on opposing sides constantly repeating
[06:53:48] the words of the emanator in front of
[06:53:50] others leaving me no choice like they
[06:53:52] like we put up a wall to separate us
[06:53:54] from the other people or whatever the
[06:53:55] [ __ ] which like I get but like how do
[06:53:57] you break that wall like how do you what
[06:53:59] the [ __ ] my blade is sharp enough to
[06:54:00] slice through it what does that even
[06:54:02] mean
[06:54:05] and that's how you
[06:54:07] win opportunity and strategy both are
[06:54:12] essential she's just that girl
[06:54:15] okay all right that's how you win opport
[06:54:19] strategy both are essential and in your
[06:54:20] plans the IPC always wins it's a
[06:54:23] metaphor maybe you just have to
[06:54:26] die to the family the life of an
[06:54:29] ambassador is still invaluable
[06:54:33] it's a huge gamble isn't it but allow me
[06:54:37] to point out a mistake the ipc's Success
[06:54:41] is Not
[06:54:42] Guaranteed I unfortunately have no
[06:54:45] contingencies for such an important
[06:54:50] matter detonating a
[06:54:52] stellon I can't do it the adventuring
[06:54:55] stone is too broken to even Safeguard my
[06:54:58] escape from the stage if at the end of
[06:55:00] the day you did not unath your blade I
[06:55:04] would have lost the bet but you want the
[06:55:05] bet so moral of the story keep gambling
[06:55:08] it is pointless to discuss it
[06:55:10] works you have won your prize is an
[06:55:14] entry ticket into that deep sea and
[06:55:17] after this whether you can return from
[06:55:19] the
[06:55:20] abyss here another gamble of yours have
[06:55:23] you never
[06:55:25] wavered
[06:55:27] wavered of course I
[06:55:30] have but I can only Bank on my own good
[06:55:33] fortune because other than
[06:55:37] that I have
[06:55:41] nothing wake up from this dream and go
[06:55:44] to where you should be your gamble is
[06:55:48] not over
[06:55:52] yet
[06:55:57] well yo yo chill before we part
[06:56:03] can you answer one more
[06:56:06] question as someone who has traveled on
[06:56:09] that
[06:56:10] road can tell
[06:56:13] me why are we born into this
[06:56:17] world if it's just to
[06:56:23] die she's I don't think this I never
[06:56:26] have nor do
[06:56:29] you but the nihility envelops you and
[06:56:32] and
[06:56:33] I and
[06:56:35] everyone and because of that it's
[06:56:38] pointless
[06:56:41] what nihilism Frederick
[06:56:45] NCH but it is still there if the dice of
[06:56:49] Fate are always
[06:56:51] waited then that is our
[06:56:54] destiny why
[06:56:57] then do we struggle against it my answer
[06:57:01] might not be able to resolve your
[06:57:03] confusion because it has been with you
[06:57:05] throughout your journey and is already a
[06:57:07] part of your
[06:57:10] life but you said sleep is the rehearsal
[06:57:14] of death so why does life
[06:57:17] Slumber because we are not ready for the
[06:57:19] final
[06:57:22] rest Akon's really okay Akon's really
[06:57:25] good at saying a lot of words without
[06:57:27] saying any words so you can definitely
[06:57:29] understand why we want to be prepared
[06:57:33] even if the ending has been
[06:57:35] predetermined that's fine there are
[06:57:37] countless things that humans cannot
[06:57:39] change like
[06:57:42] you but before the end there are many
[06:57:45] things that humans can do while on their
[06:57:48] journey and because of this whoa whoa
[06:57:50] whoa whoa the end will thus reveal a
[06:57:53] completely different
[06:57:55] meaning yo acon your text will change
[06:57:59] colors take a good look at your pocket
[06:58:02] Pock ET your friend has already given
[06:58:05] you the
[06:58:08] answer good
[06:58:15] luck oh my God it's the butt plug doctor
[06:58:18] ratio gave us yo no way what the [ __ ]
[06:58:23] the impossible in the dreams game is not
[06:58:25] death but rather dorcy stay alive I wish
[06:58:28] you the best of luck love ratio
[06:58:35] I forgot about that he gave that to us
[06:58:38] like last stream and I shall get
[06:58:46] going Mister uhoh you're
[06:58:51] leaving you ultimately chose

[06:59:28] to I'll get there one day
[06:59:32] [Music]

[06:59:39] call of GATRA triclops know that it is
[06:59:43] time for me to go and be reunited with

[07:01:50] kakava with hope for the morrow nestled
[07:01:53] in my heart I descend into the Slumber
[07:01:56] of tonight until the denant of all
[07:01:59] coming moros kisses me I have then
[07:02:01] embraced the quiet death but this man is
[07:02:04] different he lives and breathes in the
[07:02:06] present in every sinking Night by every
[07:02:09] daring gamble no vision of Morrow ever
[07:02:11] graced his dreams his life knows not
[07:02:14] quietude his fate yet demands him to win
[07:02:16] them all to weather tempests one after
[07:02:19] another till Meer enshrouds his very

[07:05:08] expected 11 times I've tried but ended
[07:05:13] in
[07:05:14] failure before I knew it this world and
[07:05:17] I became too
[07:05:20] intertwined and it became too difficult
[07:05:23] to escape the constraints of the script
[07:05:27] Elio is right in this land of the dreams
[07:05:32] you and I will reap Unforgettable gains
[07:05:37] gains hell yeah bro know people's hearts

[07:05:47] blade most of the things that I'm good
[07:05:50] at only apply to villains who need no
[07:05:56] mercy so there is only one method that I
[07:06:01] use
[07:06:05] this is to show
[07:06:09] you

[07:06:43] really hype reveal if I didn't see Dre

[07:13:45] identity and
[07:13:48] purpose my name's Boot Hill and I'm a
[07:13:52] galaxy
[07:13:57] ranger a galaxy ranger
[07:14:01] you look like you've seen a ghost did
[07:14:04] you think we all went
[07:14:07] extinct well that's the dude imagine how
[07:14:10] hot bill would be if he wasn't a
[07:14:12] cowboy the righteous Heroes of the hunt
[07:14:15] I'm sorry I mean I like the
[07:14:18] character I just think it's like I think
[07:14:21] if he ditched the cowboy everything he'd
[07:14:23] just be like twice as cool
[07:14:26] jacking he's still cool though
[07:14:29] is pardon my friend frankness but there
[07:14:32] are plenty of rumors in the cosmos
[07:14:34] regarding the Galaxy Rangers current
[07:14:36] status and none of them are pretty
[07:14:40] stories I have a hard time believing
[07:14:44] you this is hilarious the tail that this
[07:14:47] bunch of fool spin is getting out of
[07:14:50] hand there's even a bit about the Galaxy
[07:14:53] Rangers being turned into Gibbons by Dr
[07:14:56] primitive and they're in some Valley
[07:14:58] screwing around on swings
[07:15:02] of course I know you won't believe me
[07:15:05] which is also why similarly I have a
[07:15:08] hard time believing that you're the real
[07:15:11] nameless see the bullets in this gun 9
[07:15:15] mm and eternal classic I may need the
[07:15:19] astral Express's help right now but if
[07:15:22] you're an impostor just like that
[07:15:26] one okay I think I like okay I think I
[07:15:29] like his design like visuals I think
[07:15:31] it's just every time I hear him talk I'm
[07:15:33] just imagining a k and a w
[07:15:35] emote I can't allow myself to be exposed
[07:15:38] to Danger that's just the way it goes so
[07:15:43] you all have to first prove
[07:15:46] yourselves huh where are you
[07:15:54] going recognize
[07:15:58] this recognize this whips out a Co model
[07:16:02] fudger the Jade Abacus of Ally and oath
[07:16:06] the CN Joe really gave this to you
[07:16:09] guys mod fudger yo don't teach pom pom
[07:16:12] to swear this is the Jade Abacus gifted
[07:16:14] to the express by the Sho lau's General
[07:16:18] Jing
[07:16:19] Yen its presence on board serves as the
[07:16:22] sheno alliance's official recognition of
[07:16:25] the
[07:16:26] express is that
[07:16:29] enough no not bad
[07:16:33] kiddo and across these sprawling Stars a
[07:16:36] gentle squeeze is all it takes to rustle
[07:16:39] up a whole Legion of cloud
[07:16:42] Knights now I reckon that'd be one
[07:16:46] fuding sight to
[07:16:50] behold now it's your turn you're so
[07:16:53] [ __ ] with unskippable quille cut scene
[07:16:55] wait what wait am I done with 4.1 what
[07:16:59] is happening I just want to I want to is
[07:17:01] what happened did Gallagher just kill
[07:17:03] him what what is
[07:17:04] happening give me some time to Pro I
[07:17:06] mean 21 sorry give me some time to
[07:17:08] process all right then what is happening
[07:17:11] toss any questions my way let's see if
[07:17:14] my answers can't turn your trust if your
[07:17:17] gut tells you otherwise still ain't too
[07:17:20] late to show me the door and why would I
[07:17:23] play along if I truly am a real galaxy
[07:17:27] ranger you stand to lose nothing
[07:17:31] H all right then tell
[07:17:34] me what kind of organization are the
[07:17:37] Galaxy
[07:17:41] Rangers oh my friend this question is a
[07:17:44] hard one I don't think I can even
[07:17:47] consider us and I like that his eyes are
[07:17:49] [ __ ] targets that's pretty cool
[07:17:52] everyone's on their own faded path along
[07:17:55] the hunt with their own Resolute sense
[07:17:57] of righteousness and not so welcome
[07:18:00] among on such socalled Universal
[07:18:04] values
[07:18:07] oh this reply does not instill trust it
[07:18:11] only makes your predicament
[07:18:14] more
[07:18:16] precarious I'm guessing you're going to
[07:18:18] ask about some form of shared Faith
[07:18:21] right but us Galaxy Rangers don't need
[07:18:25] that sort of thing cuz Okay okay I'm
[07:18:26] going to come clean I don't look at
[07:18:28] leaks I try not to look at leaks but
[07:18:30] like four or five months ago I saw like
[07:18:33] some character with black and white hair
[07:18:35] that like a star rail design and it was
[07:18:37] like this guy before he was like a
[07:18:39] cowboy I was like holy [ __ ] this looks
[07:18:40] like the coolest character I've ever
[07:18:41] seen in my life it wasn't even I didn't
[07:18:43] look for it someone showed it to me and
[07:18:45] then now he has a cowboy hat and [ __ ]
[07:18:46] and like he's still cool I just wasn't
[07:18:48] expecting a
[07:18:51] cowboy anys I like
[07:18:54] him never bully the weak he was always a
[07:18:57] cowboy kill the innocent these o aren't
[07:19:01] something lofty beliefs but the
[07:19:03] fundamental bottom line that one must
[07:19:06] never cross maybe he was I don't [ __ ]
[07:19:08] know whatever maybe it was no hat or
[07:19:11] something I don't I don't know I don't
[07:19:12] remember what I
[07:19:19] saw he he did have the Hat okay I don't
[07:19:22] even know anymore
[07:19:41] as Galaxy Rangers we the bestly adhere
[07:19:44] to the bottom line when someone crosses
[07:19:47] them the Hunt's Vengeance will surely
[07:19:50] come
[07:19:50] knocking and In This Moment the other
[07:19:54] crucial meaning of bottom line comes
[07:19:56] into play as long as you don't cross it
[07:19:59] you're free to do whatever you please
[07:20:02] you catch my
[07:20:04] drift second
[07:20:06] question why do you seek trouble with
[07:20:09] the astral
[07:20:10] Express I already said that I seek no
[07:20:14] trouble I must go to panone for a matter
[07:20:18] but I don't have an invite and I can't
[07:20:21] even enter the family's Hotel
[07:20:23] doors if only I could borrow the
[07:20:27] nameless his
[07:20:29] identity the entire Cosmos knows your
[07:20:32] guest of the
[07:20:33] family aren't the Galaxy Rangers also
[07:20:37] esteemed
[07:20:39] guests oh you've hit the nail on the
[07:20:42] head this is why I'm here how long is
[07:20:45] this cut scene if I tell you the Rangers
[07:20:49] are pursuing an impostor a son of a nice
[07:20:51] lady son of a nice lady posing as one of
[07:20:54] us she's on Pentagon it right
[07:20:57] now my informant is a memo keeper
[07:21:01] she's the same as all mimetic organisms
[07:21:03] appear in one moment and gone the next
[07:21:07] she scares the fudge out of me still she
[07:21:11] gave me some vital
[07:21:13] info that galaxy ranger impostor who is
[07:21:16] it impostor is that the third question
[07:21:19] is it a hard question it isn't just that
[07:21:23] you might not believe me that person
[07:21:26] calls herself acaron and according to
[07:21:30] our forant she could be an emanator of
[07:21:35] nahil that's
[07:21:38] impossible that's what I said don't
[07:21:41] worry when I first received the news I
[07:21:44] had the exact same reaction as
[07:21:46] you ex never gives anyone so much as a
[07:21:50] wait are you forced into this cut scene
[07:21:51] if you enter the [ __ ] what reason
[07:21:53] would they have train station moral cuz
[07:21:56] I think zff was telling me in a call he
[07:21:58] was like dude you have to go through 20
[07:22:00] minutes some [ __ ] just to enter memory
[07:22:01] of chaos I'm like
[07:22:04] oh then you must know that can also
[07:22:07] conce our own identities which for many
[07:22:10] people it's better that way otherwise
[07:22:13] there'd be wanting Bloodshed across the
[07:22:15] cosmos or even perhaps turning their
[07:22:19] back on the path they're supposed to
[07:22:22] follow I had the Good Fortune of running
[07:22:25] into an Eli emanator its appearance was
[07:22:29] no different than that of the those
[07:22:31] clowns if it weren't through sheer luck
[07:22:33] that I got it drunk I would have never
[07:22:36] known of its eminent
[07:22:38] status even in the purest hunt you'll
[07:22:42] find the yjo alliance under the
[07:22:44] spotlight and Galaxy Rangers lurking in
[07:22:47] the shadows paths are inevitably
[07:22:50] Concepts created by people and exist in
[07:22:53] Plains beyond our
[07:22:55] understanding to reckon that nahil
[07:22:58] emanator don't exist
[07:23:01] well maybe we just ain't nihilistic
[07:23:08] enough so do you understand now your
[07:23:13] companion does this [ __ ] also
[07:23:15] only have one earring you do this on
[07:23:17] every character you don't want to
[07:23:18] believe me you'd best send a message to
[07:23:20] him I'm done I'd advise you to move
[07:23:23] fast we don't know what's happening in
[07:23:26] the Dreamscape or how much of what the
[07:23:28] memo keeper said is true
[07:23:31] and that
[07:23:33] acaron who knows what she intends to do
[07:23:36] next they're only going to have one
[07:23:38] sock oh it's
[07:23:40] done okay that wasn't that bad that was
[07:23:44] cool please
[07:23:47] don't I don't intend to do okay um
[07:23:51] that's not what the [ __ ] to
[07:23:56] you did you
[07:23:58] know people who come to the land of
[07:24:01] dreams for the first time they'll
[07:24:04] subconsciously stop to reaffirm that
[07:24:08] they're still walking on Solid
[07:24:12] Ground and then they will unanimously
[07:24:16] raise their heads to gaze at the
[07:24:22] sky be it reality or
[07:24:25] dream staring at the sky is instinct
[07:24:30] for
[07:24:32] Humanity since the day that the golden
[07:24:35] hour was
[07:24:37] completed it's always been been
[07:24:40] there watching over every single night
[07:24:44] of DEC this actually [ __ ] this should
[07:24:48] be illegal SK has been mercilessly
[07:24:53] SED died with the of
[07:24:58] nil and this whole event
[07:25:01] hey this is in the previous stream I
[07:25:02] remember within the course you guys were
[07:25:04] like spoiled all of a
[07:25:08] blade a single slash of a
[07:25:11] blade isn't really
[07:25:13] accurate it was actually two blades just
[07:25:16] that the second one was
[07:25:18] faster wait doesn't her Al have three
[07:25:20] slices though well technically four with
[07:25:22] explosion well three and then explosion
[07:25:24] okay any any guests who weren't supposed
[07:25:27] to be be invited have GED at this
[07:25:31] banquet even if the harmony is all
[07:25:36] embracing I have no choice but to show
[07:25:39] some of them the
[07:25:41] door for the sake of
[07:25:45] Pon and the
[07:25:49] peace the planet of festivities has no
[07:25:53] place for you a puppet of
[07:25:57] nity speaking of living in the shadow
[07:26:00] Shadows there's probably not much
[07:26:02] difference between us it's only polite
[07:26:05] to reveal your true self at least when
[07:26:08] speaking to others penton's dream
[07:26:12] master oh
[07:26:17] [ __ ] that's just another reason that you
[07:26:20] can't
[07:26:22] stay whether you believe it or not this
[07:26:26] is the real me
[07:26:31] we are are
[07:26:32] [Music]
[07:26:35] one is this the unity of the family
[07:26:39] espouses my mortal sh has long since
[07:26:45] dissipated the oak family's
[07:26:51] 17,36 offspring are now my eyes ears and
[07:26:56] mouths spreading Joy across dreams
[07:27:00] when
[07:27:01] required and in times of essential
[07:27:05] need exil evil from this Haven in
[07:27:14] my I feel like some of the VA said Ste
[07:27:17] and others said stead so it made like a
[07:27:19] weird last word am I am I am I am I
[07:27:21] coping from the sound of it it seems
[07:27:23] like you're asking me to leave
[07:27:27] paniconi I am glad
[07:27:30] standing
[07:27:31] one
[07:27:33] alas I'm not
[07:27:36] asking if you think you
[07:27:41] can are you threatening
[07:27:45] me I ended it with a period it was a
[07:27:49] statement not a
[07:27:51] threat okay knowing who I am and still
[07:27:54] showing such malice you're not the first
[07:27:57] nor will you be the
[07:27:59] last this scene played out many times
[07:28:02] before and usually when faced with my
[07:28:04] questions most people retort why can't I
[07:28:08] English teacher
[07:28:10] acaron the result has invariably been
[07:28:13] that they
[07:28:15] can't you are
[07:28:18] confident but be
[07:28:20] reminded the family is
[07:28:23] forgiving but not not
[07:28:25] weak the cords of the harmony extend
[07:28:29] across
[07:28:30] world if you do not not
[07:28:33] comply when the blade is unch for
[07:28:37] even breath you will never be able to

[07:35:58] character low key I feel like could have
[07:35:59] guessed 80% of what I feel like I I feel
[07:36:03] like I was gapping okay I was joking
[07:36:06] about how he's the [ __ ] K dude from
[07:36:08] dongan RPA he literally is like he
[07:36:10] literally is just lucky [ __ ] student

[07:36:14] where he like cares about his family but
[07:36:16] his family got [ __ ] murdered like
[07:36:17] like destroyed and he's like this like
[07:36:19] sad boy lament cuz his whole [ __ ]
[07:36:22] family Clan is

[07:39:04] B you I should have had
[07:39:09] BST spend
[07:39:25] freely Okay no Okay I like 2.1 I was not
[07:39:29] I'm going to be honest I mean I knew the
[07:39:31] Firefly Sam thing but I did not expect
[07:39:33] the Gallagher thing I'm kind of trying
[07:39:35] to process what that means Gallagher is
[07:39:37] cuz it was kind of a lot of yapping that
[07:39:39] I wasn't ready for and I couldn't go
[07:39:40] back and think about it because I got
[07:39:41] [ __ ] forced into a 20 minute
[07:39:43] unskippable cut scene for some [ __ ]
[07:39:45] reason um so that was pretty crazy cuz
[07:39:49] it was also like there's like no
[07:39:50] characters that could have like there's
[07:39:52] like no relevant characters to the plot
[07:39:54] so it was just like oh well it's [ __ ]
[07:39:56] Gallagher but I guess that makes sense
[07:39:58] maybe I don't even know I guess guess
[07:39:59] we'll have to do the next quest to see
[07:40:00] if it makes sense or
[07:40:03] not the rest was good though well like I
[07:40:05] I mean the rest was also
[07:40:09] good ENT stuff was
[07:40:16] cool he's a follower of enig Mada okay
