[00:04:57] search for it yeah
[00:05:06] quit following me
[00:05:33] wait I replied to someone with Thomas
[00:05:34] and at the same time someone else did
[00:05:36] did whoever who's this person with the
[00:05:39] same brain as me
[00:05:40] not just in the answer with the correct
[00:05:43] answer they said Thomas instead of Tomah
[00:05:46] what a chad
[00:05:48] chain Ryu the absolute Legends
[00:05:52] guys watch too many sock streams his
[00:05:54] brain got rotten
[00:06:06] there's a new kokomis car video coming
[00:06:08] out
[00:06:13] extreme
[00:06:24] like throwing Tails power resonance okay
[00:06:25] what else
[00:06:27] does she give you something
[00:06:30] yeah obviously Shield but like I'm
[00:06:32] talking about like compared to Tomah
[00:06:37] Chad I know Shield I know I'm done with
[00:06:40] the other Thomas gives
[00:06:48] she's cuter
[00:07:10] okay I don't know if this is a bad take
[00:07:12] or not but like Sumi Island exploration
[00:07:15] if you're playing scarra farazan
[00:07:18] low-key right Loki Loki Loki fav low-key
[00:07:22] you kind of want fav because like your
[00:07:24] farazan is like especially if she's Nazi
[00:07:27] six needs a million ER and then if she's
[00:07:30] Nazi six then Bennett also needs a
[00:07:31] million ER
[00:07:32] and even with a millionaire he might not
[00:07:34] get his wrist back so you kind of want
[00:07:36] fav

[00:23:01] new check mark this is not even code by
[00:23:03] the way they're giving us a they got an
[00:23:04] option for a check mark where it's like
[00:23:06] a special X check mark so they'll
[00:23:07] replace our x to the check mark however

[00:29:09] like as a kokomi as the leading kokomi
[00:29:11] fan I know they did her dirty in her
[00:29:13] story so I don't do it as the kokomi
[00:29:15] Nations leader however I also said if
[00:29:17] kokomi gets a rerun I would explore
[00:29:19] watatsumi Island so we do have to do

[00:29:43] catching I'm getting too good against
[00:29:44] what if I do I see deal no no I can't do
[00:29:47] that

[00:31:21] singers like some metal singers because
[00:31:23] they scream with like their diaphragm if
[00:31:26] they don't scream properly it damages
[00:31:27] their throat
[00:31:31] my guitar teacher taught me how to
[00:31:33] scream though so I know how to scream if
[00:31:34] I have to

[00:42:10] website that's all also you can see the
[00:42:12] type of person people are by what's
[00:42:14] trending for them for me kokomi is
[00:42:16] trending because I am kokomis
[00:42:19] biggest Defender
[00:42:22] [Music]
[00:42:31] truly surely donated one dollar Bros
[00:42:35] bite slip in Chilean cosplay
[00:42:39] I don't know what that means
[00:42:43] what is this dude what is this music
[00:42:47] but it makes me feel like I feel like
[00:42:48] kind of like a
[00:42:49] [Music]
[00:42:51] minor in France
[00:42:53] [Music]
[00:42:58] not even using kokomi I had kokomi so I
[00:43:02] recorded a kokomi scarra video
[00:43:05] but it started with kokomi and then it
[00:43:07] went to scars so I changed my teams from
[00:43:08] all kokomi to allskara
[00:43:10] um
[00:43:12] gotta know what the [ __ ] this is but
[00:43:14] yeah it was like yeah so I had to like
[00:43:16] because I like to do this to where when
[00:43:17] I'm talking about teams I could just
[00:43:18] scroll through them so then I'm off to
[00:43:20] edit [ __ ]
[00:43:22] there you go spoilers for The Wanderer
[00:43:23] team so you can go triple and emo double
[00:43:25] a Nemo you can go [ __ ] teams where he
[00:43:28] doesn't matter okay I
[00:43:30] I recorded this video and then I heard
[00:43:33] the Jeff's take about dendro teams with
[00:43:35] Scara and I couldn't agree more so I
[00:43:37] said that as well where a lot of times
[00:43:40] you could just play hyperloom and then
[00:43:41] truck a random unit there and it's their
[00:43:43] best team but if you do that to your
[00:43:44] Scara why the [ __ ] are you pulling from
[00:43:46] so yeah
[00:43:49] [Music]
[00:43:55] is 80 200 good or should I reduce crit
[00:43:58] rate okay
[00:43:59] [Music]
[00:44:01] I know you're just asking like like a
[00:44:04] normal question but like
[00:44:07] I feel like The Meta of people
[00:44:09] showcasing a big number is
[00:44:11] for brain a crit rate is like good if
[00:44:14] anything you want
[00:44:15] if anything when you're 80 to okay when
[00:44:17] you're 8200 more create is better than
[00:44:20] more crew damage you just want a one to
[00:44:22] two ratio until you're like 92 crit rate
[00:44:23] well even at 92 Critter is better but
[00:44:26] you might get a Biz card that gives you
[00:44:27] eight crit rates I like to have a bit of
[00:44:29] leniency so 8200 is really good but like
[00:44:31] don't think you have too much crit rate
[00:44:34] because you like it's fine
[00:44:40] yeah yeah 92 six wow thank you zox for
[00:44:43] showing me your scar out okay I'm
[00:44:44] pausing this music it's [ __ ] my vibe
[00:44:46] it's like it's too peaceful I need

[00:47:59] like the the kitten stuck on a tree or
[00:48:02] like around like a Wrestled a tiger to
[00:48:04] save uh a helpless individual it's no
[00:48:07] big deal like it's no big deal so like
[00:48:09] the reason behind why I have so much
[00:48:10] resin it's like it's not something I
[00:48:12] like to bring up like I know you guys
[00:48:14] ask about it and sometimes I answer but
[00:48:16] I don't want to make it seem like I'm
[00:48:17] flexing like it's fine like I do the
[00:48:19] things that I think I should do as a
[00:48:22] good citizen and as a good uh uh a good
[00:48:26] child of God I think I need to do those
[00:48:29] things
[00:48:30] it's just like my duty like not
[00:48:32] everyone's as strong as me not everyone
[00:48:34] can wrestle a tiger bare-handed okay so
[00:48:36] I don't need to like be like oh I can

[00:51:10] upon the Gale there should be another
[00:51:11] one here unless he flew away okay he
[00:51:13] flew away okay

[00:53:20] Loki
[00:53:27] Abyss okay the only problem with this is
[00:53:30] that there's a real a real
[00:53:32] non-negligible chance
[00:53:34] that it kills all of my motivation and I
[00:53:36] don't want to play the game after it's

[01:22:36] I'm not listen I love getting impact I'm
[01:22:39] not trying to be mean here but if in
[01:22:42] your trial you need to put a character
[01:22:43] on 240 ER maybe something about their c0
[01:22:47] is like worth looking at maybe
[01:22:49] something's wrong
[01:22:56] [ __ ] is this build
[01:23:02] the trial yards rigged yeah because
[01:23:03] slimes give a bunch of energy and [ __ ]

[01:30:52] videos and zionics for nine I'm a
[01:30:54] shangling main farming emblem forever
[01:30:56] can I join your world caught fishing
[01:30:59] forever floor 12 ain't nothing but a
[01:31:02] shangling away I'm living life Q or die

[01:31:10] going I need more tell me why shangly is
[01:31:24] foreign
[01:31:26] [Music]
[01:31:34] [Music]
[01:31:42] been fishing all my life for the cash
[01:31:46] machine
[01:31:46] [Music]
[01:31:49] oh [ __ ] wait
[01:31:53] is the reason why there's a three second
[01:31:55] rule for food falling on the ground
[01:31:57] because of ICD is there an internal
[01:31:59] cooldown unlike the dirt application so
[01:32:01] like if there's the initial proc but
[01:32:03] then it takes three seconds before the
[01:32:05] next one so if you do it in three
[01:32:06] seconds it like minimizes it because it
[01:32:08] only got one proc of dirt like germ
[01:32:10] absorption so the ICD is three seconds
[01:32:13] that's crazy oh my God I didn't know why
[01:32:16] that was a thing I just realized it
[01:32:19] wow
[01:32:21] I don't know why that thought just came
[01:32:22] to me now but I can't believe we just
[01:32:24] [ __ ] we just cracked it we just
[01:32:26] solved the case call me [ __ ] Bill Nye
[01:32:28] the gentian guy
[01:32:32] um that's actually crazy I didn't know
[01:32:33] there's ICD in real life too
[01:32:36] wow
[01:32:41] yo thanks to the oh wait I can't see my
[01:32:44] Subs oh there it is yukiara takes the

[01:33:39] sniffling I just can't stop but think
[01:33:41] about the sniffer mode and it's like
[01:33:43] ruining the show for me it's literally
[01:33:45] ruining it for me because he's literally
[01:33:46] just sniffer that's his whole [ __ ]
[01:33:48] thing he's just sniffer
[01:33:50] it's like it's ruining it for me
[01:33:55] wow
[01:33:58] it's been good though it's been good I
[01:33:59] like it
[01:34:07] sometimes I like to imagine there's a
[01:34:09] twitch chat with me IRL when I'm doing
[01:34:10] anything
[01:34:14] Demon Slayer bat chest [ __ ] you you guys

[01:34:21] chest it camera says a year
[01:34:31] well I didn't record
[01:34:34] I'm probably gonna skill issue so this
[01:34:36] won't be used this footage anyways but
[01:34:37] still
[01:34:42] too slow
[01:34:51] it truly is bad wow you're so different
[01:34:57] it is objectively enjoyable to watch
[01:34:59] both visually pleasing and also just
[01:35:02] pretty good
[01:35:03] limbo is the red I'll be real well I
[01:35:06] mean you're streaming
[01:35:09] let me stream well
[01:35:13] Raiders run away why
[01:35:15] as far as like streamers go I'm probably
[01:35:18] on the side of like
[01:35:20] most like presentable like saying and
[01:35:22] like normal so I don't know why you
[01:35:25] would you would run
[01:35:31] what's that is Tom on this team I'm on
[01:35:33] two emblem two fluorescent I don't ask
[01:35:35] shut up it doesn't really matter you can
[01:35:36] go like emblem or something you could go
[01:35:39] like Nobles if and it's not on it like
[01:35:40] guys it's like yeah it's whatever
[01:35:45] Loki exile for farazan
[01:35:49] but emblem is fine all right let's go
[01:35:56] on Fury oh I [ __ ] forgot that I'm uh
[01:36:07] I burst it is high bursted
[01:36:11] perfect fire it up supporting fire
[01:36:17] Jack The Wind Rises
[01:36:28] please please [ __ ] you I thought it
[01:36:31] would Auto Target so okay the thing with
[01:36:34] scarra is like without reminiscence you
[01:36:36] want a verse with the start of your
[01:36:37] rotation but I'm on a reminiscing so I
[01:36:38] can't do that so I have to burst like oh
[01:36:40] I met the first one first I want to
[01:36:42] burst like at the end
[01:36:43] but not like
[01:36:50] I had to Dodge I was gonna get [ __ ] by
[01:36:52] the Pyro [ __ ]
[01:36:54] up
[01:36:57] everybody it's a lot of bad things that
[01:37:00] they wish wait I don't have a pyro wait
[01:37:02] what the [ __ ] am I doing
[01:37:04] why did you guys tell me to play this
[01:37:06] team
[01:37:11] upon the game
[01:37:13] Watch it Furman that'll be fine we're
[01:37:16] gonna spam swirl
[01:37:19] huh
[01:37:21] The Wind Rises
[01:37:26] I found the game
[01:37:32] yeah just dare to mess with me
[01:37:36] actually not even bad it's fine
[01:37:40] like obviously you want Hydro in this
[01:37:42] team but like given the fact that I had
[01:37:44] no Hydra is fine
[01:37:45] all right by in this team I meant to say
[01:37:48] in this floor
[01:37:54] of elimination
[01:37:57] foreign
[01:38:27] feel sweaty to play wrong plus skill
[01:38:30] issues
[01:38:31] he's only complicated because maybe
[01:38:36] people make them seem complicated
[01:38:38] literally just Auto attack on him and
[01:38:39] then use your skill when you feel like
[01:38:40] it and use the charge pack when you feel
[01:38:42] like it you'll get the timing naturally
[01:38:43] as you play him for more than once he's
[01:38:45] not hard wait how am I knocking up wait
[01:38:47] why is my clear so [ __ ] slow
[01:38:52] I guess first off was slow but
[01:38:57] yeah
[01:39:00] bro that was yeah okay that was scary
[01:39:10] you just gotta count to two well it's
[01:39:12] like four seconds right so you burst all
[01:39:14] attack for about four seconds then
[01:39:15] charge attack or skill then four seconds
[01:39:17] then use the other one that's it
[01:39:19] basically all you need to know
[01:39:23] you don't need to do the advances like
[01:39:24] you don't need to like swap the cookie
[01:39:26] even swap back the height in between his
[01:39:28] bursts like I do that because
[01:39:30] it's more DPS like you don't need to say
[01:39:31] that
[01:39:33] okay I don't have hydro so I need to
[01:39:35] kill this guy before he gets his [ __ ]
[01:39:37] Shield
[01:39:37] [Music]
[01:39:39] my favorite streamer [ __ ] he jumped the
[01:39:42] wrong way
[01:39:43] is there a way to group both of them hmm
[01:39:46] maybe let me try something
[01:39:50] I think there's a way I just need to
[01:39:51] make him Dash in the correct direction
[01:39:56] okay that's one then I staggered this

[01:58:08] so I'm gonna yeah easy
[01:58:11] I want to buy the Coco shopping cart
[01:58:14] you're [ __ ] super rod
[01:58:17] the catch
[01:58:22] okay let me filter my friendship
[01:58:30] uh let's filter my friendship and let's
[01:58:32] go down so we'll do this uh okay so um
[01:58:35] Mika
[01:58:38] is Fang still in chat
[01:58:43] she isn't okay we don't need to play
[01:58:45] yunjin uh we could do we hit friendship
[01:58:47] I'm like I like vendor a lot
[01:58:50] um
[01:58:51] I mean we could do Eula Mika but I kind
[01:58:53] of don't want to
[01:58:54] oh [ __ ] she's there okay we're gonna
[01:58:56] play Yoon chin I like yunjin she's
[01:58:57] really cool and we can do normal I kind
[01:58:59] of want to okay so I kind of want to do
[01:59:00] a Showcase of my rank one ayato so we
[01:59:03] might want to do a normal attacking team
[01:59:04] but okay we can do this so far
[01:59:07] um
[01:59:08] we have a singer and a cat
[01:59:13] wow this team is gonna be bad no matter
[01:59:15] what we do because if we add Mika it's
[01:59:17] it's like none of these low friendship
[01:59:19] characters are good here maybe like
[01:59:20] legit you
[01:59:23] um
[01:59:25] what's your battle plan
[01:59:30] is French of 10 isn't she
[01:59:33] yeah maybe it's under 10.
[01:59:37] but we could play oemia for like just
[01:59:39] like the carry but she is such a 10.
[01:59:42] Hazel got a problem you can't solve
[01:59:46] okay
[01:59:47] what what are we swirling
[01:59:51] what are we swirling
[01:59:54] this these are like the three worst
[01:59:56] elements to pair together
[02:00:07] yeah that was a bad take
[02:00:14] fine
[02:00:18] oh okay whatever you say
[02:00:22] are are you from Tennessee because
[02:00:31] reconnaissance
[02:00:32] we're literally playing the team don't
[02:00:35] go to sleep I'm sorry
[02:00:37] wow look at this team it's so good
[02:00:39] because we have Eula and then uh yunjin
[02:00:41] to give normal attacks and then kokomi
[02:00:43] to free wait what are we doing are we
[02:00:44] freezing
[02:00:53] do machine gun guro
[02:01:00] shatter EULA
[02:01:09] to get back close to this team okay
[02:01:13] this is a good base though we'll figure
[02:01:14] it out okay we'll figure it out I need
[02:01:15] to start
[02:01:19] we can just like bring one French to 10
[02:01:21] character just to make it easy like we
[02:01:22] could do Cosmo and then like now Cosmo's
[02:01:24] not even good here we could do like ciao
[02:01:26] either like ciao and then
[02:01:29] I don't even know
[02:01:30] I mean I guess Eugene buff scar is
[02:01:32] normals technically yeah like scarra
[02:01:36] scarra farazan but then we're not I
[02:01:39] don't know we can
[02:01:46] all right anyways
[02:01:49] so here's the plan let me explain to you
[02:01:50] guys what's happening before I do it so
[02:01:53] I am planning on making two videos we're
[02:01:56] gonna do a video of spending a hundred
[02:01:58] thousand resin in Vermillion because we
[02:02:00] have confirmed confirmed
[02:02:07] in the archive
[02:02:10] spent almost a hundred thousand resin on
[02:02:14] um Vermillion and you can tell this by
[02:02:16] the ruin greater kill count so 2500
[02:02:18] means 100 000 resin but I'm also
[02:02:20] assuming maybe I've killed like a
[02:02:22] hundred exploring in the abyss whatever
[02:02:25] like I don't think I have because I
[02:02:26] really didn't explore Rune as much but
[02:02:28] let's say so we're trying to get like a
[02:02:30] bit of comfiness to prove that we spent
[02:02:32] at least a hundred thousand okay at
[02:02:34] least
[02:02:35] but before we do that which uh in case
[02:02:37] you're wondering is like 300 and
[02:02:39] something million more uh like 330 or
[02:02:41] 360 or something so yeah anyways so I
[02:02:44] want to be able to make that into video
[02:02:45] but another video I want to make
[02:02:47] is like our journey because I wanted to
[02:02:48] make a video on how I accidentally got
[02:02:50] rank on Ito because we have a lot of
[02:02:52] good clips for that and then I could
[02:02:53] like I think it'd be a funny video so I
[02:02:55] think what we're gonna do today is spend
[02:02:57] all of our resin the final home stretch
[02:02:59] of the hundred thousand then make this
[02:03:01] plus the other artifacts into the ayato
[02:03:04] video
[02:03:06] and then
[02:03:10] chose five right now okay but I have the
[02:03:11] clip of when it was one and I could
[02:03:13] probably change my build to make it one
[02:03:15] so
[02:03:16] there you go
[02:03:18] anyways I digress
[02:03:24] I digress so that's gonna be one and
[02:03:26] then two will be like oh we spent 100K
[02:03:28] resin and then we look at uh what what
[02:03:31] happens what what our show has become
[02:03:34] after 100K resin
[02:03:37] I was debating making both into one
[02:03:39] video but I feel like all the resin I'm
[02:03:41] spending is gonna be used like it's
[02:03:42] gonna be like wasted if we don't make it
[02:03:44] into something so I think that's gonna
[02:03:45] be the ayato one but also it's like a
[02:03:48] few streams ago we did the same thing
[02:03:50] and then a few streams before that we
[02:03:51] did the same thing but I don't know if
[02:03:52] the VOD is still up I don't know if
[02:03:54] there's still a lot of my [ __ ]
[02:03:57] last 2K resin stream so I don't know if
[02:03:59] I can make that into a video or not
[02:04:22] where are my videos how do you see there
[02:04:24] used to be videos here
[02:04:25] whoa about me it was wonderful what's

[02:04:37] I need to update this uh how do I see my
[02:04:40] videos

[02:05:45] whoa scenery here is wonderful
[02:05:50] well actually let me look this up I feel
[02:05:51] like as a showman I should know the
[02:05:53] answer to this question I I've
[02:05:54] definitely looked it up before but I
[02:05:56] forget let me look it up before
[02:05:57] answering you
[02:06:00] so I don't just say what I think
[02:06:13] Hey where's the spreadsheet
[02:06:16] foreign
[02:06:36] I know the the normal answer but
[02:06:38] anything of the actual math okay the
[02:06:40] next location on my list is really far
[02:06:42] away here it is
[02:06:44] okay so Scarlet Sands is uh
[02:06:47] yeah
[02:06:49] it's okay it's it's like it's basically
[02:06:52] a refined death match
[02:06:55] yeah it's the same as a refined
[02:06:56] Deathmatch
[02:06:57] so it's fine it's not great like if
[02:06:59] there's the five the other five options
[02:07:00] are better usually but it's fine
[02:07:04] but oh wait let me see this
[02:07:10] R5 I thought just better here
[02:07:15] yeah

[02:07:27] if you have no better option is fine
[02:07:30] that's there oh yeah no worries I also
[02:07:32] felt like I should know that as a
[02:07:33] Charlemagne side yeah
[02:07:36] okay shot

[02:07:45] you to a meal don't worry there's no
[02:07:47] hidden snares here our friendship is
[02:07:49] stable and mature
[02:07:51] After all you've been helping me out for
[02:07:53] so long I should have found an
[02:07:54] opportunity to return the favor long ago
[02:07:56] my my this invitation is starting to
[02:07:58] sound like some sort of long
[02:07:59] premeditated plot
[02:08:01] I've heard
[02:08:05] oh right I've already informed the
[02:08:07] restaurant as to your dietary
[02:08:08] preferences and tastes so no need to
[02:08:10] worry just relax enjoy the meal
[02:08:12] the only truth
[02:08:15] thanks Hazel
[02:08:18] oh it's all coming out now
[02:08:30] so yeah that's the plan
[02:08:33] so in the past we spent a lot gone a lot
[02:08:35] we've spent a lot of Vermillion which
[02:08:37] I'm gonna make a compilation video of
[02:08:39] 100 000 resin
[02:08:41] but for now we are going to try to see
[02:08:44] if we can finally get our perfect shell
[02:08:46] pieces with this 2 million [ __ ] 2 000
[02:08:49] resin plus our condensed resin plus
[02:08:51] maybe a few fragiles over 2000 see if
[02:08:54] today is the day plus the other streams
[02:08:56] and everything combined to where our
[02:08:58] show can be the best ciao not just in
[02:09:01] North America wonderful
[02:09:03] but in the world I've landed the perfect
[02:09:05] job
[02:09:08] and that's the plan
[02:09:12] for reference
[02:09:14] um
[02:09:23] I have a sheet that clout who's one of
[02:09:26] our mods made
[02:09:28] on how much resin we've wasted in
[02:09:30] Vermillion approximately but I'm not
[02:09:31] gonna use this for this video that'll be
[02:09:33] for the next one but yeah but tldr uh
[02:09:35] tldr it's about 100K not 120k but just
[02:09:38] keep in mind that we could have had
[02:09:39] around where's the Mora
[02:09:42] um okay we'll cover this next next video
[02:09:44] but keep in mind we could have had
[02:09:45] around 300 to 400 million Mora just by
[02:09:48] the way in case you're wondering just
[02:09:49] just keep that in mind okay cool just
[02:09:51] keep that in mind
[02:10:01] also Feng told me to add this song and
[02:10:05] uh I'm just gonna add it to q and see if
[02:10:07] it's good
[02:10:10] 86 hours in domain lamal wait really
[02:10:13] where did it say that
[02:10:16] yo thanks for the
[02:10:19] six months wall me
[02:10:21] balls oh yeah 85 hours
[02:10:27] no chance shallow laments per burst
[02:10:29] point three number of runs number of
[02:10:31] shao laments assuming he always needs a
[02:10:33] child 1200. it's a lot of [ __ ]
[02:10:35] laments
[02:10:36] fish buildings that you won
[02:10:39] all right so if we're gonna spend two
[02:10:41] thousand resin we might as well not
[02:10:42] waste the Friendship XP so let's play
[02:10:44] characters that aren't friendship ten I
[02:10:45] think we use
[02:10:48] honestly these characters with scarafar
[02:10:49] is probably fine
[02:10:51] but then I can't use it as a background
[02:10:52] footage okay well we'll use the
[02:10:53] Friendship team after a little we'll
[02:10:54] start by doing
[02:10:56] like a normal team
[02:11:00] we'll do like uh Zing QE and then Kaya
[02:11:04] Maybe we don't have a Healer but I don't
[02:11:07] need a Healer because I'm good I'm too
[02:11:08] good at the game I don't think I need a
[02:11:09] Healer but I also want to spam charge
[02:11:11] attack so slingshot doesn't really work
[02:11:12] ah we'll just end to see Fish fill what
[02:11:15] the hell there's a five gifted I
[02:11:16] appreciate it
[02:11:23] I think shows the Healer true true
[02:11:31] called telepathy
[02:11:37] by Jungkook and his friends temperature
[02:11:47] no I hit
[02:11:52] Frozen
[02:11:54] Rises
[02:12:00] it's been a long day without you my
[02:12:06] friend
[02:12:15] it's the worst Starlight gameplay I've
[02:12:17] ever seen all good though
[02:12:24] do we break the 2000 resident or do I
[02:12:26] condensed
[02:12:28] if we break 2000 then we're technically
[02:12:30] uncapped kakomi Nation Comey so that's
[02:12:34] the four months picture this I already
[02:12:35] thanked you I take back my thanks [ __ ]
[02:12:37] you
[02:12:39] okay I'm gonna use oh God these guys
[02:12:51] isn't your Kaya on geared oh wait true
[02:12:54] actually
[02:13:00] Rune grader is tall so this works
[02:13:02] unironically but we should probably use
[02:13:04] Rosario I I just remembered I just
[02:13:06] wanted to use Kaya's skin sag
[02:13:13] have a nice uh uh uh badge big F
[02:13:18] what you need from Vermilion
[02:13:21] um
[02:13:24] I guess that's a good question
[02:13:27] what do we need from beryllium thanks
[02:13:28] for asking I think we could use a good
[02:13:31] flower an animal goblet a better feather
[02:13:35] that's basically it our stats is good
[02:13:37] and our circlet is really good
[02:13:41] so two to three pieces
[02:13:44] honestly if we got an amazing Vermilion
[02:13:46] Animo goblet would be fine
[02:13:49] because we could use an offset something
[02:13:52] else and then we'll be good
[02:14:01] yeah I couldn't say that last song it
[02:14:02] wasn't bad
[02:14:06] thank you Fang
[02:14:08] uh we're not getting Kai though we'll
[02:14:09] use uh
[02:14:11] uh we'll need a shiny understood
[02:14:14] understood
[02:14:20] wasn't bad it was amazing sorry
[02:14:34] do your Masters bidding okay shut up
[02:14:37] okay I will
[02:14:44] that's far enough
[02:14:47] ah cry louder
[02:14:51] rain outlines your fate
[02:14:57] when did you even get two thousand two
[02:14:59] hundred two thousand resin oh I already
[02:15:00] told you guys I said at the start of the
[02:15:02] trailer for new versions I'll explain
[02:15:03] basically uh
[02:15:07] no I can't but maybe you guys could rate
[02:15:09] that could be good
[02:15:11] that also could be good
[02:15:13] start
[02:15:17] also we're gonna keep all of our five
[02:15:19] star artifacts from today we won't
[02:15:20] strongbox just in case Fontaine gets a
[02:15:22] new strong box because it probably will
[02:15:23] and then we're gonna dump it in there
[02:15:24] and make a new video from it
[02:15:26] uh yeah so to answer in case you're new
[02:15:28] here I just got here that's what the
[02:15:30] subs are the guys that's the same quests
[02:15:32] and Kim takes the uh the the subs so
[02:15:36] um
[02:15:39] suggestions I do and I add them to
[02:15:41] notepad anyways I need to focus
[02:15:45] yeah we have 2000 resin because I um
[02:15:48] so here's what happened Twitter changed
[02:15:50] to X for some reason and so the good
[02:15:53] people over at X support said hey there
[02:15:56] used to be Legacy verified you had a
[02:15:58] check mark when it was imported by the
[02:15:59] way not a big deal but you know just
[02:16:00] saying just saying something to remind
[02:16:02] you guys so yeah so they said since it's
[02:16:04] called X we are actually giving a
[02:16:06] special check mark to anyone who has X
[02:16:08] in their name and used to be verified so
[02:16:10] that's actually so I but I but you have
[02:16:12] to pay for Twitter blue and I don't want
[02:16:13] to do that so what's happening is
[02:16:15] because I refused they said hey we
[02:16:18] really appreciate your content so we
[02:16:20] really would do anything for you just
[02:16:22] say something we'll get it for you do
[02:16:23] you want like a car a house like you've
[02:16:25] really saved us and saved this platform
[02:16:27] we could do anything for you and I said
[02:16:29] look I'm I don't want that I'm a humble
[02:16:32] man so please if anything like if
[02:16:36] anything just just give to charity be a
[02:16:37] nice person and they said we're not
[02:16:39] gonna do that we're a corporation but we
[02:16:42] can give you some resin a voucher for
[02:16:45] 2000 resin for you to be will pay for
[02:16:48] your resin 2 thousand resin will pay for
[02:16:50] it so that you can have more content on
[02:16:52] your stream
[02:16:53] and so that's what we're doing
[02:16:55] oh this could be
[02:17:03] this could be 60 in this it might be
[02:17:05] better than your circuit watch watch

[02:18:53] that's all Catherine what the [ __ ] this
[02:18:54] guy add ass Rabbit Song
[02:19:01] laughs
[02:19:02] do you want to enter the Forgotten Hall
[02:19:06] you even get hurricanes we had one we
[02:19:08] had like a tornado recently but it
[02:19:10] wasn't like big it was like a warning it
[02:19:12] was fine
[02:19:13] uh but no
[02:19:21] we got floods here though not not not
[02:19:23] like now but like a few years back
[02:19:25] there's like big [ __ ] floods
[02:19:27] we have to like help out like it was
[02:19:29] like a whole [ __ ] area was [ __ ]
[02:19:30] flooded
[02:19:43] cry cryo incarnate
[02:19:49] you're dead why am I dying what the
[02:19:54] [ __ ] share the case upon me
[02:20:00] go
[02:20:11] that could be good this is going to be
[02:20:14] crit damage mainstat with flat attack
[02:20:16] flat HP ER and good rate
[02:20:32] too slow
[02:20:34] wait why am I not playing kokomi I just
[02:20:36] realized
[02:20:49] by ordinance divine
[02:21:01] know your place
[02:21:11] for most taser teams you want like sing
[02:21:13] Cho and then like Fishel or Beto or both
[02:21:15] and then a Nemo character kokomi works
[02:21:18] on teaser but she would want to be The
[02:21:19] Driver
[02:21:20] I wouldn't use those like all field in
[02:21:22] that team because there's usually better
[02:21:23] options like even Bennett can be better
[02:21:25] but on field she's fine for taser if you
[02:21:28] need healing
[02:21:30] um although usually you could do like
[02:21:31] Synchro Beto and nandi healing and then
[02:21:33] kokomi would shine more in like dendro
[02:21:34] teams or like with uh freeze or with
[02:21:37] like
[02:21:46] when's the last time you visited your
[02:21:48] teapot literally today to get my second
[02:21:50] transient resin
[02:21:51] yeah
[02:21:54] at a reliable source say that Fang is
[02:21:56] taller than you she isn't
[02:21:59] I'm like I'm like eight foot but she
[02:22:01] wears giant ass heels and then poses
[02:22:04] super straight and [ __ ] and then I'm
[02:22:05] just like hunched and like leaning and
[02:22:07] I'm chill so like it looks almost close
[02:22:10] but it's not
[02:22:12] quit following me
[02:22:19] the 35
[02:22:22] why can't I make 35 contests
[02:22:26] any Motionless in nine months appreciate
[02:22:29] it
[02:22:33] do you play gunshot on the phone
[02:22:35] wait what do you mean
[02:22:37] I sometimes I do
[02:22:39] nine months yay
[02:22:57] that's crazy you can make 35 condensed
[02:22:59] but you can't make one good artifact
[02:23:06] okay okay watch this
[02:23:10] I was gonna save all my strong boss
[02:23:12] artifacts for font 10 but no I'll prove
[02:23:14] I'll prove it out or wrong watch this
[02:23:17] watch us
[02:23:24] okay maybe you're right
[02:23:26] foreign
[02:23:37] no we are not strong boxing till
[02:23:39] fountain
[02:23:48] huh uh okay we need to play a friendship
[02:23:52] team
[02:23:55] friend
[02:23:59] I mean I could just play Xiao [ __ ]
[02:24:02] carry them but
[02:24:04] if our dendro characters need friendship
[02:24:06] we can also play like an electro carry
[02:24:08] and then just like aggravate like we
[02:24:10] could do
[02:24:14] honestly I haven't played Sino in a
[02:24:16] while I could probably do this
[02:24:17] but then we have no
[02:24:37] we'll see pleco call me oh [ __ ] I didn't
[02:24:39] want to play kokomi
[02:24:48] take heart Victory will be ours
[02:24:57] what if I play three healers what if I
[02:25:00] chat what if I what if I do what do I do
[02:25:02] at full healer team where's kooky
[02:25:05] don't tell me they did it again
[02:25:14] I don't know
[02:25:17] okay let's play neither blue
[02:25:21] because kirana bites you need friendship
[02:25:24] so we can do this this is fine we'll
[02:25:25] play another blue
[02:25:37] unfortunately I think literally every
[02:25:39] character in this team needs em though
[02:25:42] because literally anyone can bloom at
[02:25:44] any time we'll just give it to kokomi
[02:25:46] but yeah
[02:25:55] okay
[02:25:58] foreign
[02:26:17] oh she's not okay cool even better team
[02:26:19] then
[02:26:23] find the side effects seems like okay we
[02:26:27] do this then we cook over
[02:26:33] here
[02:26:43] okay I don't want to talk about this
[02:26:49] you haven't activated the circle shut up
[02:26:51] I I know that's why I said I don't want
[02:26:53] to talk about it I didn't notice until I
[02:26:55] saw my Bloom damage and then I was like
[02:26:56] okay [ __ ] you
[02:27:07] so uh what is there to talk about for
[02:27:09] our 2000 resin chat
[02:27:11] foreign
[02:27:13] type of jam I like raspberry I like
[02:27:16] blueberry jam I think blueberry jam is
[02:27:17] pretty good I'm a blueberry enjoyer
[02:27:24] guava okay that has to be some fancy
[02:27:27] [ __ ]
[02:27:30] where do you get guava jam I'm sure it's
[02:27:32] good but where the [ __ ] you get guava
[02:27:34] jam
[02:27:37] it's cheap really
[02:27:40] apricot apricot's good but then I get
[02:27:42] the chunks of apricot and I don't want
[02:27:44] it
[02:27:45] it's still good though
[02:27:52] taking the turn for the better
[02:28:01] those are the best parts no it
[02:28:03] imbalances the ratio so the ratio of
[02:28:06] like jam to bread to whatever else is on
[02:28:08] it is like usually perfect until you get
[02:28:10] a big chunk of apricot that you're not
[02:28:12] expecting and then the big fruit will
[02:28:14] ruin the perfect Jam to whatever else
[02:28:17] ratio
[02:28:21] marmalade Supremacy okay
[02:28:23] I've only had a marmalade as a kid and
[02:28:26] maybe my taste buds have a refined since
[02:28:28] then but I remember [ __ ] hating it I
[02:28:30] remember having marmalade and it just
[02:28:32] tasted like [ __ ] refined ass
[02:28:34] I don't know
[02:28:40] maybe I was just a kid though like I
[02:28:42] don't trust my palette back then but I
[02:28:44] did not like uh marmalade
[02:28:50] Marvel is just Citrus Jam I'm throwing
[02:28:53] the orange one specifically I usually go
[02:28:55] for raspberry jam remember I honestly
[02:28:57] either way
[02:29:10] mine the side effect
[02:29:23] all right that's the first one
[02:29:26] first artifact space of many so let's
[02:29:29] clear some
[02:29:36] burst of many
[02:29:39] foreign
[02:29:46] facts suck
[02:29:49] and we're also trying to save a lot of
[02:29:51] five star effects with a new strong box
[02:29:52] if there is one allegedly who knows but
[02:29:54] I assume there will be
[02:29:57] why so many locked ones bro
[02:30:04] wait I'm out
[02:30:06] wait bro we have
[02:30:10] 1200 artifacts that are either five
[02:30:13] stars
[02:30:15] or locked like four stars
[02:30:18] holy [ __ ]
[02:30:25] Elliot
[02:30:30] this could be good like we'll check
[02:30:31] we'll check we'll check
[02:30:35] unlock your four stars there's a reason
[02:30:37] they're locked
[02:30:38] there's a reason they're locked chat I
[02:30:40] would have just locked [ __ ] like with no
[02:30:41] reason I'm not dumb
[02:30:43] I'm not unreasonable
[02:30:48] wait wait okay to be fair before I get
[02:30:52] too excited I one of the only good
[02:30:54] pieces I have is a good sense
[02:31:01] ball trap
[02:31:03] ball strap
[02:31:05] oh well I don't want to do that though
[02:31:07] wait do I not have art wait I'm out of

[02:33:14] Chad if everyone types people flower
[02:33:16] right now will roll a good flower
[02:33:18] this is a social experiment if everyone
[02:33:21] types people flower will get a good
[02:33:23] flower
[02:33:25] you have to type it though
[02:33:27] you have to type

[02:33:43] flower and it'll bless this piece that's
[02:33:45] all I asked chat that's a lot
[02:34:09] and I choke up my water
[02:34:16] dude
[02:34:18] maybe it's a sign
[02:34:20] today is not a not a good day okay we'll
[02:34:23] unlock some four stars
[02:34:26] uh why does somebody unlock four stars
[02:34:29] let's see
[02:34:36] okay we don't need martial artists

[02:35:07] Jeong LI or something it's like font
[02:35:08] yeah it's Loki fine

[02:35:12] who cares
[02:35:23] bro why are all my Vermillion pieces
[02:35:25] either em or ER
[02:35:32] okay chat I'm gonna say something there
[02:35:35] is one two three four five six flowers
[02:35:39] the odds of us getting that have okay
[02:35:41] six of these flowers have one crits that
[02:35:43] the odds of us getting on the other crit
[02:35:46] either rate or damage on them is like
[02:35:48] basically 100 so we're gonna roll all of
[02:35:50] them we're gonna get them all to plus
[02:35:51] four
[02:35:52] I'm gonna get this one before then I'm
[02:35:53] gonna keep feeding it until we got one
[02:35:54] with double crit
[02:35:56] eight months I appreciate it flower hope
[02:35:59] you finally got a good piece yeah we're
[02:36:01] about to actually we're about to watch
[02:36:03] we're about to
[02:36:14] we're about to get a baby's watch
[02:36:30] what
[02:36:31] we're about to get a good piece of watch
[02:36:32] if this gets great and ER and crit
[02:36:35] damage like that's actually not bad
[02:37:00] Ah that's a little I still told you I
[02:37:04] still told you I still told you I said
[02:37:07] sometimes if you have faith the artifact
[02:37:11] Lords answer your call they say hey
[02:37:14] maybe we've had we've been a bit too
[02:37:16] tough on ziox maybe we've
[02:37:19] we've [ __ ] with them a bit too much
[02:37:21] maybe you know he could have some good
[02:37:23] luck for once
[02:37:26] maybe for now we'll take it easy on them
[02:37:31] they didn't say that give up on your
[02:37:33] dreams nothing's worth it
[02:37:40] that's fine this is gonna make up for it
[02:37:42] we're gonna keep farting
[02:37:43] don't give up on your dreams it's fine
[02:37:45] like like there's a light at the end of
[02:37:47] the tunnel that's the point of this
[02:37:49] stream like it's gonna things get better
[02:37:51] okay they always do Okay and like even
[02:37:54] if we're struggling for a week a year
[02:37:56] two years
[02:37:57] it'll get better don't worry
[02:38:01] so far it's a statistical anomaly true
[02:38:04] and and and soon you know what goes up
[02:38:07] must go down and what is down will go up
[02:38:10] okay and we can only go up from here so
[02:38:13] so so throw like from this point onwards
[02:38:17] nothing can hurt us
[02:38:23] because I know that we are destined for
[02:38:27] greatness
[02:38:46] watch this feather
[02:38:51] unironically could be good for so though
[02:39:00] your luck is atrocious okay you know
[02:39:02] what my theory is I think whenever
[02:39:04] people think I'm lucky I get unlucky
[02:39:06] like I got instara I got Celia in my
[02:39:09] first pull then I got [ __ ] but from
[02:39:11] every batter after I got by lose like on
[02:39:14] twice on gentian I got the [ __ ] okay
[02:39:16] you're gonna Pepe W this but I got my
[02:39:18] [ __ ] OG Xiao Sans literally although
[02:39:20] like two and a half years ago at this
[02:39:22] point literally or maybe not a half but
[02:39:24] over two years ago and and since then
[02:39:26] it's just been bad after bad
[02:39:30] remember health comes first
[02:39:38] could you imagine if I just stayed on my
[02:39:40] two-piece two piece on Shao and then
[02:39:42] they got the new Vermilion came out
[02:39:44] right and I said you know what there's a
[02:39:45] new set it's a bit better but it's not
[02:39:47] worth farming let's do emblem instead
[02:39:50] could you imagine where I would be right
[02:39:51] now
[02:39:52] like imagine okay I know I'm saying this
[02:39:55] is a joke right but imagine how
[02:39:57] unironically my life would probably be
[02:40:00] different like we would be having a
[02:40:01] different conversation right now people
[02:40:03] in chat would be different the whole
[02:40:05] dynamic would be different literally
[02:40:06] everything like like it's like Butterfly
[02:40:08] Effect maybe I would have had like a job
[02:40:10] like I would have been like waking up at
[02:40:12] like 6 a.m oh boy can't wait to be a
[02:40:15] good citizen today and then just like I
[02:40:17] could have lived a good life
[02:40:27] your ayato would be bad do you want to
[02:40:29] know the worst part
[02:40:34] yeah I may have the best Echoes ayato
[02:40:35] right but do you know what the worst
[02:40:37] part is
[02:40:38] let's talk about glad pieces which is
[02:40:40] like a similar set in strength
[02:40:47] huh that's a pretty good Hydro goblet
[02:40:50] that's another pretty good Hydro goblet
[02:40:51] okay what about your flower oh well you
[02:40:53] can use this on ayato
[02:40:55] oh wow there's a lot of flowers you
[02:40:57] could use on ayato that's pretty cool
[02:40:58] okay okay what about your feather oh
[02:41:00] okay
[02:41:02] that's a like these are feather this is
[02:41:04] a feather you can use on ayato
[02:41:06] sounds not that good but I have a goblet
[02:41:08] Circle it oh wow you actually have some
[02:41:11] pretty decent glad circles
[02:41:13] huh almost as if you didn't need to farm
[02:41:16] Echoes or Vermillion that's crazy
[02:41:21] but that's why we play games chat what
[02:41:24] the rules are made to be broken if you
[02:41:27] just follow the rule book right meta is
[02:41:30] made to be broken nobody made nobody
[02:41:32] like nobody remembers oh this guy is
[02:41:34] shangling is so good no one cares okay
[02:41:36] no one cares no one no one no one goes
[02:41:40] says hey I'm gonna wake up today play my
[02:41:42] favorite video game just to fit in the
[02:41:44] mold okay
[02:41:46] and that's the lesson
[02:41:55] we're out of condenser is it
[02:42:00] any more goblet unlucky
[02:42:09] why does Neil have a double blade she
[02:42:10] doesn't you just saw it wrong I actually
[02:42:11] have key she's on key
[02:42:22] what version of seven is this I don't
[02:42:23] know I went on the Spotify this is the
[02:42:25] the one that was like most plays I just
[02:42:26] added it
[02:42:32] keyless dude we don't need key because
[02:42:34] content's gonna give us a stale baguette
[02:42:37] oh oh my God instead of a blacksmith
[02:42:40] it's gonna be a baker and then he bakes
[02:42:42] you a baguette sword and then you use it
[02:42:44] and it gives you HP because it's a
[02:42:46] [ __ ] baguette so it gives you HP so
[02:42:47] we're getting a new HP sword
[02:42:51] wait that's actually dude imagine we got
[02:42:54] a baker
[02:42:59] goblet in Vermillion uh yes I actually
[02:43:01] have a good one for uh fickle or is it
[02:43:04] on the eye that's not official
[02:43:07] it's actually really wait who the [ __ ]
[02:43:09] is that on
[02:43:13] kaching
[02:43:15] cacking
[02:43:17] yeah it's actually pretty good
[02:43:19] it's usually my official though let me
[02:43:21] give it to her
[02:43:22] we're official
[02:43:24] where is
[02:43:25] yes
[02:43:30] laughs
[02:43:33] hello memos
[02:43:40] call memos you're French right do you
[02:43:41] think they're gonna make a bakery for
[02:43:43] Fontana instead of a blacksmith and then
[02:43:45] it'll be like uh it'll be like uh
[02:43:46] they'll it'll be a boulangerie right and
[02:43:49] then and then what he'll do is he'll
[02:43:50] make you a baguette as a weapon uh for
[02:43:53] your sword but also a pole arm and a
[02:43:55] claymore and then you can use it and
[02:43:56] it'll scale on HP so then you will have
[02:43:59] a weapon for aniloo
[02:44:01] swap
[02:44:20] don't spread your stupidity dude it's
[02:44:22] actually a good idea though
[02:44:24] I would rather play a video game where I
[02:44:26] can equip a baguette than a random
[02:44:28] another generic dude who remembers
[02:44:29] frostbearer genuinely who the [ __ ]
[02:44:32] remembers frostbearer or or ice but ever
[02:44:34] or [ __ ] Dragon spine spear
[02:44:37] nobody
[02:44:42] oh yeah and you can eat your sword but
[02:44:44] then you lose it
[02:44:47] and it gives you 500 attack because
[02:44:49] you're like damn that was a good
[02:44:50] baguette
[02:45:01] yeah I saw they put they always put
[02:45:03] reside on like a full physical build
[02:45:22] okay sorry

[02:54:44] foreign
[02:55:06] [Music]
[02:55:20] I wish I could Auto Battle this domain
[02:55:25] I wish I would remember exactly what I
[02:55:28] did and then do the exact same thing
[02:55:38] will you ever stop farting Vermillion
[02:55:40] yes we are about to have we've spent
[02:55:42] officially 100K resin I'm gonna make
[02:55:44] that into video this is gonna be maybe
[02:55:45] the finale at least until Fontan maybe
[02:55:48] not but we need to actually be efficient
[02:55:50] with our residents of this so we're
[02:55:51] spending 100K and then we'll see what
[02:55:53] happens and then from there maybe I'll
[02:55:54] take a step back to reflect on my life
[02:55:58] find the side effects and then surely we
[02:56:01] can just strong box it and then we're
[02:56:03] fine
[02:56:23] today yeah I might Auto Battle am I dead
[02:56:26] ass lonestarial and auto battle in the
[02:56:27] background though

[03:00:26] don't have an enema one like anyone who
[03:00:28] has like a hydro hard adapt or like a a
[03:00:30] [ __ ] like Electro thundering fury
[03:00:33] like that's fine

[03:01:04] and a good [ __ ] dendro gilded I just
[03:01:07] can't get a [ __ ] Vermillion

[03:01:23] but I'm not gonna get my hopes up I'm
[03:01:25] just gonna let the roles speak for

[03:02:22] it's like
[03:02:25] [Music]
[03:02:27] okay maybe they just hate maybe it's
[03:02:28] like maybe it's a language issue
[03:02:31] [ __ ] it
[03:02:39] uh I need a language that I can't even
[03:02:41] understand because like there's a few
[03:02:43] where like I could guess it needs to be
[03:02:45] like
[03:02:57] you know I saw an Indonesian meme that
[03:02:59] made me laugh so we'll do Indonesia
[03:03:00] Indonesia I mean [ __ ] it
[03:03:08] wait why does this still say achievement
[03:03:09] I can still kind of read it like can I
[03:03:11] let's see let's look at an artifact
[03:03:14] wait
[03:03:20] wait why is it the same

[03:03:56] mostly is the same let's find a little
[03:03:58] maybe maybe it's like maybe good
[03:04:00] artifacts are hidden here
[03:04:12] [Music]
[03:04:27] let's move out we'll see maybe maybe the
[03:04:30] luck is hidden in the server well not
[03:04:32] it's not a server but in this language
[03:04:44] dude
[03:04:49] also Mariah is uh Mariah's Indonesian so
[03:04:53] if he edits this then and we do get
[03:04:55] something good then he can put a spicy
[03:04:57] name that I wouldn't know of so it's
[03:04:59] like double content
[03:05:11] all right pause champ
[03:05:22] the only difference is there's a comma
[03:05:23] instead of a DOT
[03:05:33] well that was uh
[03:05:36] tragical Dormer
[03:05:51] wait Chad what what language is ah I'm
[03:05:54] actually not gonna say it what language
[03:05:55] is goat penis

[03:06:59] is like
[03:07:02] either pork or lamb it's one of them but
[03:07:05] shouldn't move be cow because Cows say

[03:17:46] we're switching it up
[03:17:48] and it can't get worse from here
[03:18:08] Einstein didn't factor in RNG when he

[03:40:47] are you on
[03:40:49] if you're on like melt or some [ __ ] yeah
[03:40:51] but if you're on business or no you want

[03:40:54] because like that create your way you
[03:40:56] get you have could be attack percent or
[03:40:58] could be energy recharge it could be
[03:40:59] crit damage
[03:41:01] because you start you get like 40 damage
[03:41:03] from business here you get uh 15 from
[03:41:05] crowd resonance

[03:46:56] all right I'm not the w
[03:46:59] all right let's get the other million
[03:47:06] it's gonna do really let's get it really
[03:47:15] [Music]
[03:47:27] got something for you
[03:47:38] I'm so sad I don't know what to talk
[03:47:40] about artifact Farm I'm just like
[03:47:41] waiting
[03:47:48] stand disappear they even get a lament
[03:47:52] man what's the point worthless
[03:48:00] foreign
[03:48:02] the tree but after using alloy because
[03:48:05] the game will never expect Ami
[03:48:12] foreign
[03:48:22] wait I have a video
[03:48:24] hey everyone I'm test here how to get
[03:48:27] overpowered artifacts and I Wish future
[03:48:30] mtash could have told past mtash I
[03:48:33] already liked this video These artifacts
[03:48:35] because I made some dumb mistakes when I
[03:48:39] learned from them and now I'm sharing
[03:48:41] this info with you so that you can have
[03:48:43] the best artifacts in the game and
[03:48:45] honestly make them two three even four
[03:48:48] times better than they would have been
[03:48:50] now I want to explain this because on
[03:48:52] many of the artifacts that you're gonna
[03:48:54] get you're going to get wasted stats
[03:48:57] stats that don't really help you like
[03:48:59] defense which I did a whole video on how
[03:49:02] it's not really a good stat if you're
[03:49:05] looking to do the most damage possible
[03:49:07] and Destroy enemies before they even hit
[03:49:09] you
[03:49:10] well you're gonna need to follow this
[03:49:12] guide It's Gonna Save You resources it's
[03:49:14] gonna save you time and it's actually a
[03:49:16] really simple system once you understand
[03:49:17] it so let's get started on how these
[03:49:20] artifacts work we'll talk about how to
[03:49:23] farm for artifacts after but this system
[03:49:26] is used even when you're low level
[03:49:37] up here and we're going to look at a
[03:49:39] couple of upgraded items and I want to
[03:49:42] talk about stats on it so with the
[03:49:44] Gladiators Nostalgia that I have here
[03:49:46] any of the five star items you can see
[03:49:49] are rolling with four stats on it
[03:49:52] already they're right there these are
[03:49:54] unupgraded and they still have four
[03:49:56] stats now four stats is the most that
[03:50:00] you can have on any artifact what are
[03:50:02] you doing I'm taking notes blue one
[03:50:03] you'd be able to upgrade and get four on
[03:50:05] this purple one I've got four you can't
[03:50:07] get higher than four
[03:50:09] but
[03:50:10] every four levels that you upgrade in
[03:50:13] artifact one of two things will happen
[03:50:17] number one if you upgrade an item to
[03:50:20] level four it will get another Stat or
[03:50:24] if it's got full stats it will upgrade
[03:50:27] one of those stats and that happens
[03:50:29] every four levels now a blue artifact
[03:50:33] can only be leveled up to twelve so you
[03:50:35] could damn it sooner time
[03:50:38] to and an upgrade depending on the blue
[03:50:41] and with a purple it upgrades to level
[03:50:44] 16. so you could max out the stats and
[03:50:47] then get a couple upgrades
[03:50:49] now with a five star you've got all the
[03:50:52] stats on there already so at level four
[03:50:54] at level eight twelve sixteen and at 20
[03:50:58] you're gonna upgrade one of these stats
[03:51:00] as well as the base stat so that is
[03:51:04] where a lot of the value comes in but
[03:51:06] this video isn't about maxing out five
[03:51:08] starred artifacts because that's gonna
[03:51:10] take a lot of time this is about turning
[03:51:13] even your blue artifacts into God rolls
[03:51:16] it's about turning your purples into
[03:51:19] great DPS boosting purples that are
[03:51:21] going to carry your team for a long long
[03:51:23] time until you can replace them
[03:51:29] here
[03:51:30] it's not perfect but if we were to level
[03:51:33] it up to four which I'm gonna do I'm
[03:51:35] gonna get another stat all right so
[03:51:37] we're gonna enhance it to level four and
[03:51:38] you can see that it says adds one new
[03:51:40] bonus attribute so we're gonna enhance
[03:51:43] this
[03:51:43] and we're gonna see
[03:51:45] wow we actually
[03:52:13] got crit rate so this is a this is a
[03:52:16] situation where I actually got lucky
[03:52:19] this is what you would want to happen
[03:52:21] now the HP HP is always what you get on
[03:52:25] flowers there's nothing you can do about
[03:52:26] this one but these stats here okay this
[03:52:29] doesn't work I tried I tried we need I'm
[03:52:31] looking for a [ __ ] pulling ritual
[03:52:33] there's no one I mean a [ __ ] rolling

[04:21:03] that could be good
[04:21:09] wait we spent two thousand resin wait
[04:21:11] more I had five condensed
[04:21:18] play dory's theme and then play her C6
[04:21:21] hyper Bloom with Zinky and Yow then you

[04:21:33] do I have butterflies though
[04:21:36] let me check
[04:21:38] did I have to I literally I can't fathom
[04:21:40] spending 2 000 resin and then missing
[04:21:42] out on the other resin
[04:21:44] I don't have condensed
[04:21:46] why do I never know where the [ __ ]
[04:21:47] contest is yeah I don't have any
[04:21:51] uh let me go get a crystal fly there
[04:21:54] should be Crystal flies
[04:21:57] foreign
[04:22:03] I got the ones that were here but
[04:22:05] there's also some under this rock and I
[04:22:08] didn't have a dental character so I
[04:22:09] didn't open it
[04:22:12] but you can go here boom and then there
[04:22:14] should be some easy
[04:22:25] [ __ ] you pigeon plus one foul
[04:22:33] all right
[04:22:36] we have now unfortunately but officially
[04:22:38] spent over 2 000 and today that's just
[04:22:40] today alone let me check my Rune grader
[04:22:42] kill count actually
[04:22:45] good
[04:22:56] almost 2 600. I see
[04:22:59] anyways we have officially spent over 2
[04:23:02] 000 resin today alone
[04:23:04] and have we gotten any good Vermillion
[04:23:06] pieces no but we've had pieces that had
[04:23:08] potential and I would argue that's good
[04:23:10] enough now we also have
[04:23:14] we also have an Echoes piece now this
[04:23:17] isn't just any Echo species like we have
[04:23:19] a few that we could level this could be
[04:23:20] good this could be good but
[04:23:23] we got this piece
[04:23:26] Max credential Max Credit roll my Ito
[04:23:30] right now already basically rank one
[04:23:32] because of our unfortunate luck which I
[04:23:35] can show
[04:23:36] but
[04:23:37] I think if this piece
[04:23:40] rolls only crit
[04:23:46] be a
[04:23:48] joyful situation
[04:23:51] so we're gonna roll it and we're gonna
[04:23:53] roll it slowly
[04:23:55] to really Savor the rules also I don't
[04:23:58] think I've ever had 10 million Mora so
[04:24:00] this is like the most model we're ever
[04:24:01] gonna have by the way I'd never
[04:24:04] ever have this much of aura

[04:52:25] new pieces I might have to update it
[04:52:28] I can track actually I forget what it
[04:52:30] said
[04:52:32] [Music]
[04:52:37] it's just strictly better than the
[04:52:39] million after the bay to update no
[04:52:42] because
[04:52:47] but this is basically what I have except
[04:52:49] the other sounds
[04:52:51] also it wants me to go to 22 ER because
[04:52:53] I didn't set the ER amounts
[04:52:57] and I didn't do like I didn't set up
[04:52:59] like this one's not set up
[04:53:06] I didn't do like uh I didn't set a fores
[04:53:08] on or anything which changes it a bit
[04:53:13] wait what the [ __ ] is this when did I
[04:53:16] how do I not know my own artifacts

[04:54:32] like 24.
[04:54:33] [Music]
[04:54:36] Xiao inherently has like more than that
[04:54:39] there's no way you have 30 crit rate bro
[04:54:42] just equip an artifact
[04:54:47] and most of shao's weapons are crit rate
[04:54:49] like even the freedom like oh free plays
[04:54:51] like black Castle which is crit damage
[04:54:53] or not black though what the [ __ ] am I
[04:54:54] saying black Cliff which is great damage
[04:54:55] but most of his weapons are great
[04:54:59] [ __ ] black Castle all right I'm doing

[05:02:05] years for the second Geo region we'll be

[05:02:10] that's not bad
[05:02:12] it could be like a union uh I mean she
[05:02:14] doesn't really want damage but it could
[05:02:16] be like um
[05:02:18] Ito could use ER
[05:02:21] um

[05:03:00] you play Goro and then either no other
[05:03:02] Geo or you play Albedo or zhangli
