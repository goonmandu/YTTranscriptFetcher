[00:24:41] [ __ ] get a room [ __ ] you don't
[00:24:43] have to come after us like we're just
[00:24:45] anyways um it's okay but so there's a
[00:24:49] picture I'm just going to recreate it in
[00:24:50] Ms paint actually I'm loing up and I say
[00:24:53] there's a picture of like seedin healing
[00:24:55] 30k and then ya Yao healing two so then
[00:24:57] zag quotes to he was like someone do
[00:24:59] this with uh Ula and nevet so then I did
[00:25:03] this I got off Google images caught it
[00:25:05] was like YULA doing a million and then
[00:25:07] nevette doing
[00:25:09] 14
[00:25:11] anyways um another dayse
[00:25:15] stream oh yeah we have to watch this
[00:25:17] video also a doctor commented on my hair
[00:25:20] this is real by the way it's
[00:25:22] um one
[00:25:25] second Zio what's the channel called
[00:25:29] uh daily
[00:25:33] dose okay first of all
[00:25:35] impacts this thumbnail is crazy I would
[00:25:39] hire you just to fire you [ __ ] you okay
[00:25:42] this is personal okay this is now
[00:25:44] personal [ __ ] you second of all that's
[00:25:47] number one second of all a doctor
[00:25:50] commented a jur not uh uh a a medical
[00:25:54] doctor commented
[00:25:58] hello doctor
[00:26:00] here you know they're a doctor cuz the
[00:26:03] name on YouTube is cortisol which I
[00:26:04] think is like a it's like a compound
[00:26:06] it's like a medicine cortisol it's
[00:26:11] something it's your body's main stress
[00:26:14] hormone there you go anyways his hair
[00:26:17] thinning pattern isn't consistent with
[00:26:19] androgenic alpaca which cons which
[00:26:21] occurs either from the front on both
[00:26:24] sides or from the vertex of the head so
[00:26:26] it's most likely just the way his hair
[00:26:28] is but if he's going through hair loss
[00:26:31] the pattern is more similar to the one
[00:26:32] seen in a women last I checked I was a
[00:26:34] man
[00:26:35] therefore I do not have hair loss and my
[00:26:38] hair is just a little thin on the top
[00:26:40] but that's cuz it's parted like Dad hung
[00:26:41] and B
[00:26:52] Lun
[00:26:53] anyways first woa streamer to have a
[00:26:56] tacit Mark IRL he's definitely Arrow so
[00:27:04] SOB
[00:27:05] anyways power of
[00:27:08] coming all right let's turn that guy
[00:27:11] off um so maybe a jiny video weaing
[00:27:15] waves if you guys are interested maybe a
[00:27:16] jade video for Star but dude I I feel
[00:27:18] like every time I pick a starel
[00:27:20] character to review their mid and then I
[00:27:21] skip the best ones so I don't know maybe
[00:27:23] I'll wait till like I think I'll do Jade
[00:27:25] if I have time if not I'll do the next
[00:27:26] STL character the sh the one that's
[00:27:29] strangling uh and then genin we're
[00:27:31] getting Emily next patch so we're
[00:27:33] definitely doing an Emily video at Z
[00:27:36] zero X do you think another chamber for
[00:27:38] third team in Abyss would be better or
[00:27:40] worse than imag I haven't done the
[00:27:42] theater yet but
[00:27:46] probably yeah I don't

[00:28:00] guys like it or not and if I like it or
[00:28:01] not the only thing I'm guaranteed is I'm
[00:28:03] going to stream it when it's out and I'm
[00:28:04] probably going to make a video like my

[01:05:57] dude I think I still have this [ __ ]
[01:05:58] zit dude this thing was tilting me it's
[01:06:01] not your show I have excellent news none
[01:06:03] of this matters none of this counts
[01:06:05] because we're going to actually do a
[01:06:06] winner takes all spiral Abyss Showdown
[01:06:11] team versus Team don't worry about it
[01:06:13] it's just skin never say that you sound
[01:06:16] like that sounds disgusting time wins
[01:06:19] dude you know I friend once we were at
[01:06:20] like a house not party it was just like
[01:06:22] a like we were all just like it was just
[01:06:24] like a like a chill like we all vibing
[01:06:26] we this dude this had like his he was
[01:06:29] like this dude has like his like balls
[01:06:31] out and I was like why do you have your
[01:06:32] balls out he was like it's it's just
[01:06:35] that sounds fair he said in French he
[01:06:37] just in Grand but I don't know how to
[01:06:38] say that in English so if none of this
[01:06:40] matters the double or Z do you remember
[01:06:42] you were there wait Z are you here do
[01:06:44] you
[01:06:45] remember z z do you
[01:06:49] remember I wasn't there dude you don't
[01:06:51] know the S Grand backstory okay whatever
[01:06:55] he needs this desperately so if none of
[01:06:57] this matters the double or nothing was
[01:06:59] just he just lost nothing so I just
[01:07:01] forfeited by Twitter you guys ready to
[01:07:03] go can we walk there instead of doing
[01:07:05] the weird why do you keep asking these I
[01:07:07] get I get every time like oh look who's
[01:07:10] being Pon right
[01:07:12] now I did all of this for nothing just
[01:07:15] to jump
[01:07:17] cut
[01:07:19] F hey Nick Hey
[01:07:22] Jake which
[01:07:26] hey hey you want to solo the this oh
[01:07:30] yeah all this is like kind of off the
[01:07:32] cuff two things one I would explain the
[01:07:34] ending and how we we made it better
[01:07:36] modified it for Content uh I'm I'm like
[01:07:38] the Martyr all good second of all uh uh
[01:07:42] this Abyss we were like okay let's make
[01:07:44] it as challenging as possible cuz we had
[01:07:47] an account with like mid artifacts but
[01:07:49] everything was C6 and like you can't
[01:07:51] disable constellation so I was like okay
[01:07:52] I don't want this to be too easy so me
[01:07:55] and Jake decided we're going to solo
[01:07:56] everything with chlorin and arino the
[01:07:59] Only Rule that we had from like
[01:08:01] production was like use chlorin cuz you
[01:08:03] want to like showcase a new character so
[01:08:04] I was like we'll do chlorin one half AR
[01:08:06] Lino the other half and then solo no
[01:08:08] healers well chlorin can self heal so AR
[01:08:10] Lino but AR gets [ __ ] so like only two
[01:08:16] characters why you looking I I thought
[01:08:19] it effect yeah down all right you want
[01:08:21] to do Claren arino choren alino chamber
[01:08:24] one chamber two and chamber three also
[01:08:27] this coffee saved my life I was
[01:08:29] literally passing out on the couch
[01:08:31] upstairs cuz I had like no sleep and
[01:08:33] then I was like I I like laid down on
[01:08:34] the couch with one airpod in and I was
[01:08:36] like blasting music to like Revitalize
[01:08:39] my system and then I I had a coffee and
[01:08:40] then I was like okay I'm good want to do
[01:08:42] choren alino laoren allino chamber one
[01:08:45] chamber two and chamber three are we
[01:08:46] going to die if we die that's that's on
[01:08:50] you man but if if you were to choose
[01:08:53] like a full team what would you do okay
[01:08:55] first half easy Claren Nita fishal
[01:08:58] unless it's some broken C6 Electro maybe
[01:09:01] but probably offal and then Kaza I'm
[01:09:03] trying to speed clear and then all I do
[01:09:04] is I Electro I swirl it boom they're
[01:09:06] dead in my burst
[01:09:08] uhhuh it's about time I was talking he
[01:09:11] was exp I was I was explaining he asked
[01:09:12] me a question he asked me a
[01:09:15] question you got I asked him a question
[01:09:17] and then I could have went strongly for
[01:09:18] a shield that's all I'm oh good yeah
[01:09:21] tell me more yeah that's not bad you can
[01:09:23] also play other characters with Clarin
[01:09:24] you don't have to do he official Kaza uh
[01:09:27] but I I do like that core or Jong Lee uh
[01:09:29] you can also do finina but the problem
[01:09:30] is you kind of die like chorin teams
[01:09:33] they if you don't have a Healer like
[01:09:34] your chorin self heals but if you're
[01:09:35] Fina draining and you're hyper looming
[01:09:37] yourself like you can just die so I
[01:09:39] don't like that as much Jong Le is nice
[01:09:40] for comfort so can kiaha kiaha can give
[01:09:43] you some shielding uh make her nicer
[01:09:44] Comfort Nikita's nice but gets
[01:09:46] multi-wave it can be annoying but in
[01:09:48] that case thundering Fury is better Oh I
[01:09:49] thought thundering Fury was a myth
[01:09:51] you're a myth you're a myth okay uh in
[01:09:54] multi-wave content if you if you don't
[01:09:55] have it it kind of sucks but against
[01:09:57] like a single boss or something you know
[01:09:58] I don't get me wrong I love to run what
[01:10:00] the [ __ ] is the other set [ __ ]
[01:10:02] Whimsical framy that one's fine Vibe all
[01:10:07] we ready yeah go I mean just go right
[01:10:09] now I'm going right now right now start
[01:10:12] Wheel of Shame on the line okay I'm I'm
[01:10:15] ready in three two the song's a
[01:10:21] banger so I had done this maybe 60 [ __ ]
[01:10:25] times I had to reset ayss for like 2
[01:10:27] days straight because this was when
[01:10:29] chlorin released okay I almost broke my
[01:10:31] [ __ ] monitor chlorin was like the
[01:10:32] most tilting character to test on 200
[01:10:34] ping she's really good and she's fun but
[01:10:35] I have to do triple KY which I'm going
[01:10:37] to say this weaing waves Pro tries gen
[01:10:40] an impact whoa this fight is like a
[01:10:41] hologram no it's not but like if you
[01:10:43] don't have a shield and you're on 250
[01:10:45] ping and you're like not like anyways
[01:10:48] it's actually like [ __ ] annoying but
[01:10:50] it is what it is
[01:10:52] um yeah so I was like okay I'm going to
[01:10:54] run to the left cuz that's a a way to
[01:10:55] make the the blue dude not Dash okay

[01:20:42] will it's just that it's just that I
[01:20:45] like no cuzzz cuzzz all right let's get
[01:20:49] these losers out of here next team let's
[01:20:52] go
[01:20:55] so uh guys what are your teams going to
[01:20:57] be uh choren Fishel kazua Nita probably
[01:21:02] sorry did I say team you get to pick one
[01:21:05] character per side that's right you
[01:21:08] thought it was going to be easier for
[01:21:09] you guys you have okay F okay should I
[01:21:12] um first of all let me link this video
[01:21:15] go like it if you want uh second of all
[01:21:19] okay chat uh do I let it play or do I
[01:21:23] ruin the facade I'm not going to run the
[01:21:25] facade 30 seconds to make up but you've
[01:21:27] got the skill right okay you got the
[01:21:29] this was I'll let it play and then I'll
[01:21:31] talk oh you didn't oh you didn't know
[01:21:33] oh so here's the thing you need to make
[01:21:36] up over 30 seconds because Jake kind of
[01:21:39] screwed you over a little bit oh okay
[01:21:42] does that seem hard to you no not at all
[01:21:45] 30 seconds oh yeah in the where okay
[01:21:48] basically what happened was we uh after
[01:21:50] me and Jak cleared is like really close
[01:21:52] and they're like oh that was hype maybe
[01:21:54] we should put that at like the end of
[01:21:56] the video but then we were like well we
[01:21:58] don't want to re-record it so I was like
[01:21:59] okay it's all good we'll just do another
[01:22:01] like we we'll do it normally and then
[01:22:03] Doro and John did they both did a clear
[01:22:07] with a full
[01:22:09] team and I like built a team for Doro
[01:22:12] and Jake built a team for John and it
[01:22:13] was like it was were
[01:22:15] poging but like they both cleared at
[01:22:17] about the same time so there's like a
[01:22:19] difference of like 30 seconds and it
[01:22:21] like wasn't hype so then they were like
[01:22:23] [ __ ] it redo it with solo characters to
[01:22:25] make it more hype so that's what you
[01:22:27] guys are seeing and then the first cut
[01:22:28] was like remove that should be too hard
[01:22:30] right so technically you're a gen gamer
[01:22:32] though right yeah I already won you're
[01:22:34] the best around okay I got this I like
[01:22:36] where this is going all right it's
[01:22:38] supposed to be hard okay don't worry
[01:22:40] immersion gone no no it's better this
[01:22:42] way okay listen Okay but Doro and you
[01:22:45] don't die at all that's an easy dub oh
[01:22:47] that's true yeah and Doro starts with a
[01:22:49] d and so does d so Doro is going to die
[01:22:52] and Jonathan starts with a J because
[01:22:54] you're a
[01:22:56] joke I don't mean that I'm so sorry I I
[01:22:59] said that and I was like that was good I
[01:23:01] didn't mean that good I'm ready I'm
[01:23:03] ready I griefed though I kind of I kind
[01:23:05] of griefed Doro cuz I was like cuz
[01:23:08] because the first one wasn't close I was
[01:23:10] like okay I don't want Dora to have an
[01:23:11] unfair advant like I don't want to like
[01:23:12] try hard coach him and then it's like
[01:23:14] too easy and it's not good content so I
[01:23:16] kind of like was like oh he's got this
[01:23:18] and I didn't help him that much until
[01:23:19] the end and I kind of griefed him for
[01:23:21] that cuz Jake was like hard helping
[01:23:22] let's go but it's okay sorry D begin
[01:23:27] like I don't want to like backseat
[01:23:30] him oh okay okay okay looking little
[01:23:34] nervous just a little bit just a little
[01:23:36] bit that's okay nervous still
[01:23:40] win this is way grouped him really well
[01:23:42] though but this guy's going to dash away
[01:23:43] now because you ran too far like it's a
[01:23:46] you know it happens there the best of us
[01:23:48] okay I've seen enough on this side for
[01:23:49] now doing decent wait wow wait you

[01:24:09] what' you say what were you saying Jake
[01:24:11] before that just happened I was just
[01:24:12] saying all you have to do is don't die
[01:24:14] but you died uh did you die oh we got
[01:24:17] this in the bag baby whoa whoa whoa this
[01:24:20] guy's getting coaching we have a cheater
[01:24:23] a midstar part it's just a little help
[01:24:25] you know is Doro too good is my teammate
[01:24:28] needing emotional support yes where's
[01:24:30] your support you forgot your teammate
[01:24:32] was even your teammate the enti that is
[01:24:33] true dude I didn't for I when's his

[01:24:55] playing pack I'm I'm actually surprised
[01:24:58] I'm doing this he's too good Doro looks
[01:25:00] like he's chilling this like the easiest
[01:25:02] thing he's ever done literally is jonan
[01:25:03] looks stressed he's stressed he's tense
[01:25:06] relax his forearms are
[01:25:10] shaking oh nice Z Z's zag and my grandma
[01:25:14] have the same birthday and it's [ __ ]
[01:25:16] January 6th so I know where zag was I
[01:25:21] thought what up John oh okay
[01:25:25] that's okay I think we're chilling still
[01:25:27] F fine to be fair I did die in this
[01:25:31] chamber so this is actually closer than
[01:25:33] it looks because can't heal cuz he
[01:25:35] doesn't have Al so this is more close
[01:25:37] than although I believe in Doro and
[01:25:38] there's no way he
[01:25:41] dies that's my Grandma's birthday too is
[01:25:43] your grandma are you my sibling is your
[01:25:45] grandma called T Janet
[01:25:49] maybe if yes okay okay DM me I died I
[01:25:53] died I died
[01:25:57] die what's even happening I was
[01:26:00] looking doing Grandma does that mean
[01:26:02] Jonathan's ahead now is this her first
[01:26:04] name deated yes I'm ahead well you guys
[01:26:08] are pretty even now okay same boss same
[01:26:10] enemy it's pretty close it's pretty
[01:26:12] close yeah capellia was
[01:26:16] hard and then one more he's dead yeah
[01:26:18] okay okay all
[01:26:22] right it's close all he has to do is die
[01:26:25] if Doro dies you're back in the lead
[01:26:29] okay cinematic battle I think oh do you
[01:26:34] what the dude listen man this is hard
[01:26:37] who is that guy poor John they were
[01:26:40] flaming him cuz he was he kept dying
[01:26:42] there but then Doro died to this part
[01:26:44] which this part was hard to be fair but
[01:26:46] I what what Doro did like I could have
[01:26:48] prevented this if I was coaching as hard
[01:26:49] as Dr was I uh I was which I mean sh
[01:26:53] good like good well played to Jake cuz
[01:26:55] that's what I should have done he Doro
[01:26:56] wasted his burst on arino and aro's
[01:26:58] burst doesn't do [ __ ] so you only use it
[01:27:00] as a panic button and because he doesn't
[01:27:02] have it he can't heal up here so he he
[01:27:04] gets one shot unlucky I just died too
[01:27:07] wait did you actually yeah I just did C6
[01:27:10] okay well still use it as a panic button
[01:27:11] doesn't matter well for solo like for
[01:27:15] solo I'm in the lead cuz if you're like
[01:27:18] if you're soloing against someone else
[01:27:19] and you're not like a like you have
[01:27:22] to you have to play to never reset cuz
[01:27:25] like it doesn't matter how fast you

[01:58:33] up oh
[01:58:44] cake all right I guess we start can I
[01:58:48] talk to this guy I thought talking to
[01:58:49] him would start it that's why I didn't
[01:58:53] oh oh Pat its
[01:58:54] head oh it doesn't show
[01:58:57] me he he so
[01:59:00] soft wait I'm not done I'm not done I'm
[01:59:02] not
[01:59:03] done rub it
[01:59:08] ears change the
[01:59:16] music it's so quiet I should have turned
[01:59:19] it up
[01:59:28] [Music]
[01:59:42] all right here's what we're going to do
[01:59:43] we're going to do this for the first
[01:59:44] time we're going to try hard we're going
[01:59:46] to clear it easy and then afterwards
[01:59:49] we'll probably test some stuff around
[01:59:50] and then I'll give you guys my thoughts
[01:59:51] on it I already have my thoughts but I
[01:59:54] like they're all influenced so I want to
[01:59:56] go in with no thoughts and then and then
[01:59:59] no
[01:59:59] bias my guess here's my initial guess I
[02:00:03] think this game mode is going to be mid
[02:00:05] for like three seasons and then they're
[02:00:07] going to release they're going to like
[02:00:09] make it in like five in like half a year
[02:00:11] it's going to be actually hard and like
[02:00:13] way better I I'm guessing it's going
[02:00:15] like cuz like even in in like starl when
[02:00:17] they give us new modes it would start
[02:00:19] kind of like I feel like it just got
[02:00:20] better or it would get harder
[02:00:22] we'll see
[02:00:25] though what the [ __ ] is
[02:00:45] this Reddit is melting a fuel saying
[02:00:47] it's hard okay again I'll only give my
[02:00:50] opinion when I'm done doing it because
[02:00:52] right now it's it's I do not have a
[02:00:54] credible opinion but what I think it is
[02:00:57] is it's do you have characters built so
[02:01:00] it's going to be I think it's like easy
[02:01:01] if you're endgame and it's hard if you
[02:01:03] aren't and and don't have enough
[02:01:06] characters that's like my guess but I
[02:01:09] hope that it like kind of in the future
[02:01:11] balances in the Middle where it's like
[02:01:13] harder but less demand well actually I
[02:01:16] don't give a [ __ ] if it's demanding [ __ ]
[02:01:19] you it's only Annoying if it's demanding
[02:01:22] if you need a lot of five stars like if
[02:01:23] it's like hydro hydro is like all five
[02:01:25] stars
[02:01:26] anyways get out of my chat Z I know what
[02:01:29] your take is and I don't want to be
[02:01:30] influenced well okay don't actually get
[02:01:31] out of my chat but just type like
[02:01:32] aboba I'm trying to have a a a no bias
[02:01:36] take but not yet I haven't played it
[02:01:38] yet just abova okay we'll see though
[02:01:41] anyways performance prep so we're doing
[02:01:43] only hard mode the rest doesn't matter
[02:01:45] um you must select 18 characters to
[02:01:47] participate in the challenge character
[02:01:48] has to be level 70 you can invite one
[02:01:50] Supporting Cast character
[02:01:53] so 18 level 70s that's uh a
[02:01:57] lot I will say though um I I really
[02:02:02] think that leveling characters 70 is
[02:02:04] annoying but I I I'm pretty I don't know
[02:02:07] how hard this is going to be but my
[02:02:09] guess before this mode came out was you
[02:02:11] probably can have one really good
[02:02:13] character and then carry through
[02:02:15] everything with three level 70s that are
[02:02:17] barely built like not built just leveled
[02:02:20] but I could be wrong we haven't done it
[02:02:22] yet so let's try it uh reward
[02:02:29] preview wait which one is the oh this is
[02:02:31] the weekly one right toy metal all right
[02:02:34] let's do

[02:03:29] different element types that's not going
[02:03:30] to what the
[02:03:32] [ __ ] I mean I guess it's still a crit
[02:03:36] stick uh that's fine that's good
[02:03:39] actually that's also good iron sting
[02:03:44] Tom I mean that's fine I mean it's fine
[02:03:48] cuz you're not hyper blooming but like

[02:08:45] W okay let me actually do a real
[02:08:47] Supporting Cast let me not like throw
[02:08:48] the game uh okay we're going to do this
[02:08:50] I'm going to do this as a guide maker
[02:08:52] okay okay and then okay so okay so first
[02:08:55] of all I'll hi them's broken I just need
[02:08:56] to make sure I an electro support okay
[02:08:58] we're going to put Fel in here and we're
[02:08:59] going to put y Miko cuz she get either
[02:09:00] support or on field depending on what I
[02:09:02] need okay cool um realistically we also
[02:09:07] put ryen but I don't know if my Ryden is
[02:09:08] built and she's also C2 so it's cheating
[02:09:10] so I'm not going to put
[02:09:12] Ryden um do I have chevis in here
[02:09:16] already yeah chevis is definitely broken
[02:09:18] uh for this actually I don't know if
[02:09:21] she is because what if I don't get only
[02:09:23] pyro Electra what if I get Animo I don't
[02:09:26] know we'll see I don't know how this
[02:09:27] works I'm putting
[02:09:29] Shia for sure Shia is my best character
[02:09:31] I'm putting shun she can make anyone
[02:09:34] plch and Is A
[02:09:42] Healer uh I'm going to put kazua in here
[02:09:45] cuz he's
[02:09:47] broken I'm going to put Bennett cuz he's
[02:09:49] broken I'm going to put solid pyro DPS
[02:09:53] maybe hut hut works on her
[02:09:58] own
[02:10:02] um I mean you already know Shang Ling
[02:10:05] the problem with Shang Ling is if I get
[02:10:06] a really bad team for her like no benett
[02:10:08] no no pyro battery but I mean it should
[02:10:11] be
[02:10:12] fine last slot uh we could do like
[02:10:16] a so baiju would be really good if we
[02:10:20] get Electro characters and we have a
[02:10:22] quick and team but if we get pyro
[02:10:24] characters and it's a burning team BYU
[02:10:25] sucks so I feel like a strategy you
[02:10:27] could run is like running minimal pyro
[02:10:30] or some [ __ ] no maybe not I don't know
[02:10:33] or just no anemo and then you go chevis
[02:10:35] and you full overload I don't actually
[02:10:36] know no you want anemo to monop pyro I'm
[02:10:39] I'm just yapping never mind rizzly is
[02:10:41] definitely good though cuz you can no
[02:10:42] but what if you super
[02:10:44] conduct well if you if you melt he's
[02:10:47] good uh maybe I'm overthinking we could
[02:10:51] play the newest character siin for
[02:10:53] [ __ ] nothing sorry that was toxic
[02:10:55] please don't put that in the video uh I
[02:10:58] I feel like groupers are going to be
[02:10:59] good I don't know what we're fighting
[02:11:00] but I feel like there's a good chance
[02:11:01] vent is good here can I check what I'm
[02:11:04] fighting oh it's just
[02:11:06] bosses never mind well it's villain act
[02:11:09] three I don't know if act one and act
[02:11:10] two are like small mobs but Verdes and
[02:11:13] ventor has to be
[02:11:14] good venti is good
[02:11:18] okay but like for sure like sucros gives
[02:11:20] you a bit of gives you uh [ __ ] Verdes
[02:11:23] and
[02:11:24] venor but the EM might be wasted if
[02:11:26] you're not proing
[02:11:28] reactions okay we'll keep V in
[02:11:31] here let me make sure ven is geared
[02:11:34] though okay not bad I mean it's kind of
[02:11:37] a crit venty not an em venty but like we
[02:11:39] take
[02:11:44] that who are you plunging on for shenyun
[02:11:46] okay look shenyun works as a Healer
[02:11:48] she'll work with Y she'll work with Shia
[02:11:50] she'll work with huta and she'll work
[02:11:53] with C6 Bennett which I don't have
[02:11:56] active so she's not she might not be the
[02:11:59] most consistent option but I don't
[02:12:03] care VV is good too
[02:12:06] t okay I think we're ready should I play
[02:12:09] duuke though I want to play
[02:12:11] duuke who Do I even
[02:12:17] bench am I overthinking this oh benched

[02:12:29] I kind of want to just remove everything
[02:12:31] and click that I'm not going to do that

[02:12:39] ready okay we're running full trial
[02:12:42] characters and then we have our
[02:12:45] cast hopefully it's not hard I mean I I
[02:12:47] don't think it'll I mean I I do hope
[02:12:49] it's hard cuz hard is fun but like I I
[02:12:51] don't think it's going to be that bad
[02:12:52] okay all sorts of events can happen

[02:18:15] are real
[02:18:17] experiences you mean if it comes from my
[02:18:20] imagination it can't be real life I
[02:18:24] remember a time when a hord curse was
[02:18:25] put on me H curse all good was CED in
[02:18:27] unmelting ice and I had to spend my days
[02:18:30] and I also remember playing with White
[02:18:32] Fang in the forest we chased golden
[02:18:35] butterflies waited through rushing
[02:18:37] streams and shattered the very Moon
[02:18:39] beneath our feet and I'll never forget
[02:18:42] marching in that celebratory procession
[02:18:44] with the other troops being showered in
[02:18:46] confetti as I excitedly waited for her
[02:18:49] majesty the queen to bestow her honor
[02:18:50] upon me to me all these events are
[02:18:53] indistinguishable from real experiences
[02:18:56] take my latest dream for instance from
[02:18:58] now on you are a concierge Okay cool so
[02:19:02] this gu M here and like I I waited
[02:19:06] waited and waited and now finally two
[02:19:11] guests have arrived at last I can
[02:19:13] fulfill my duty is there anything else
[02:19:16] you'd like to ask me
[02:19:21] uh about Madam Mage and who is this
[02:19:24] Madam Alice Suk is he really just a
[02:19:26] figure from your dream well Madame Mage
[02:19:29] is Madame Mage she and her friends oh
[02:19:33] yes and they're all Mages too each one
[02:19:35] of them is a master if it actually is a
[02:19:37] Quil pens of Caster spells she has a
[02:19:40] very mysterious ink bottle but the other
[02:19:43] Mages all love her magic they use their
[02:19:46] powers of creation to transform Her
[02:19:47] Fantasy truth into true how do they do
[02:19:50] that I haven't the slightest L Skipper
[02:19:53] do you know what happens if I don't skip
[02:19:54] lore okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[02:20:01] sorry let's look at a take from someone
[02:20:03] who doesn't skip
[02:20:07] lore D Lees Al should imprison all
[02:20:09] enemies and double your damage but at
[02:20:11] the cost of capping your FPS at two
[02:20:12] until the end of combat he imprisons all
[02:20:16] the enemies in his ass just like he did
[02:20:19] with the eye of the first field tiller I
[02:20:22] don't know what the [ __ ] that even means
[02:20:24] but this is a non lore Skipper
[02:20:30] take
[02:20:34] anyways is there anything else you'd
[02:20:36] like to ask me about the book yes I what
[02:20:39] do you mean per well Madame Mage says
[02:20:41] that every page of a story book I'm sure
[02:20:44] only the most distinguished of guests
[02:20:45] are able to take the what a thrilling
[02:20:48] battle thring Tales of Dragon Slayers
[02:20:49] that's what every story needs to spice

[02:21:00] performances in fact is there anything
[02:21:03] else you'd like to ask me that's all I
[02:21:04] want to ask is getting more confusing by
[02:21:06] the second but Wolfie seems all right so
[02:21:10] we should be fine right
[02:21:13] besides our goal is to set foot in every
[02:21:15] corner of tat and the courage to boldly

[02:31:52] left
[02:31:54] one wait there's another free mystery
[02:31:58] cache Boon consumes all Fantasia money
[02:32:03] and gain one random wondrous wanderous
[02:32:06] Boon consecutive counter measures gain
[02:32:08] one random wanders Boon but after

[02:32:37] click the left
[02:32:39] one mysterious cash effect triggered
[02:32:42] lose all of your things okay for 8
[02:32:45] seconds after use your skill the crit
[02:32:46] rate for the character's normal attacks
[02:32:48] and crit damage increased plus 10 plus
[02:32:50] 20 that's not bad I don't know if I care

[02:33:02] fine but I could have spent money first
[02:33:05] yeah is there a way to skip cuz I would
[02:33:07] have skipped if I could have I feel like
[02:33:09] you maybe that means you should spend
[02:33:10] money in general like before you get

[02:38:45] talk uh I'm going to do like four four
[02:38:49] maybe coming in is this level okay can
[02:38:52] you hear Pon like hindsight Harry we
[02:38:55] probably don't need like that was a lot
[02:38:56] easier than I thought we definitely
[02:38:57] don't need to use Kaza but like H it's
[02:38:59] fine I don't think it's going to get
[02:39:01] like that much worse do I have to talk
[02:39:03] to someone why did it make me
[02:39:07] leave oh arino oh and Kaza hey Kaza
[02:39:12] what's up man I don't believe anyone
[02:39:14] enjoys taking up arms and going to war
[02:39:17] whenever the sound of clashing blad FES
[02:39:19] Fades into the
[02:39:21] distance I appreciate too quiet for you
[02:39:24] then I'll play a tune on the
[02:39:27] leaf wait I want I want Shia in here
[02:39:30] arino what do you up to my
[02:39:33] Queen the enemies we Face are of a
[02:39:36] lonely breed deal with them however you
[02:39:38] see fit but get
[02:39:41] complacent you should expect to fend for
[02:39:44] yourself as I am not in the habit of
[02:39:47] coming to other people's rescue you if
[02:39:50] you do encounter a foe for whom you are
[02:39:52] no match simply make yourself
[02:39:55] scarce and I shall deal with it in due
[02:39:59] course thank
[02:40:03] you har like you know if here if you're
[02:40:05] free later okay all right uh continue
[02:40:08] performance sorry I just had to talk to
[02:40:10] her uh let's keep going okay so maybe
[02:40:13] spending money is good companion select
[02:40:16] is probably better than random but I
[02:40:18] kind of want to do random cuz it's funny
[02:40:19] what do you guys
[02:40:20] think no let's select okay wait so what
[02:40:23] is this choose one character to join
[02:40:25] from two random
[02:40:27] pyros oh I guess if you don't want pyro
[02:40:30] then you do a full random one okay do I
[02:40:32] want pyro pyro could be good but
[02:40:34] honestly I'm not for random cuz it's
[02:40:35] funny so let's just do
[02:40:36] it ooh sorry I'm sorry that's my goat
[02:40:40] I'm sorry I'll them love you
[02:40:42] though we got
[02:40:45] sh all right
[02:40:47] nice uh let's fight the the the thing
[02:40:50] what is the bonus challenge defeat the
[02:40:53] exhausted Jade PL ter room after act its
[02:40:55] activated state is
[02:40:58] finished okay I have to make sure I do
[02:41:00] that I guess it doesn't
[02:41:02] matter it's only for 20
[02:41:04] money five DPS it doesn't matter we
[02:41:07] don't take
[02:41:09] damage watch this watch
[02:41:13] this yeah we could have drafted more
[02:41:15] supports in
[02:41:16] hindsight we do Claren
[02:41:21] okay this is a little
[02:41:22] cooked it's a little cooked a [ __ ] we
[02:41:26] don't have supports uh we waste a Scara
[02:41:30] we waste a
[02:41:31] farzon cuz farzon like you'd be like oh
[02:41:34] she's the best support for Shia but
[02:41:36] she's like czo so I don't even care if I
[02:41:38] had mine I would save her but like I
[02:41:40] don't care and then we save Shia for
[02:41:42] like good hard content and we waste like
[02:41:47] a I mean we could do Yia are Yia is C6
[02:41:49] though so I probably don't want to like
[02:41:51] that's a with support cast maybe
[02:41:54] maybe that's kind of rough I wish I had
[02:41:59] like I don't
[02:42:02] know [ __ ]
[02:42:08] it it doesn't we told you it literally
[02:42:10] doesn't matter though like look how many
[02:42:11] characters we have I'm going to do this
[02:42:13] want to do this let do
[02:42:16] this let do this
[02:42:19] I

[02:43:46] situation dear guest there is absolutely
[02:43:49] nothing to fear to start with's going to
[02:43:51] be left with scuffed supports and no DPS
[02:43:53] at the end okay we're in version like
[02:43:56] 4.7 you should understand that supports
[02:43:59] are DPSS oh no I'm going to have Bennett

[02:45:02] going to get uh
[02:45:06] brother what if I refresh events just
[02:45:08] for
[02:45:10] fun I probably
[02:45:13] shouldn't I kind of wanted to get a a
[02:45:15] wondrous Boon though I feel like that's
[02:45:16] better than another companion H we'll
[02:45:18] get a companion maybe it's good
[02:45:20] random oo uh hm's good if we have an
[02:45:23] electro support so we can Quicken right
[02:45:25] now we have none so I can't even play a
[02:45:27] Hy them but I assume we'll get one so
[02:45:28] we're going to click them how long will
[02:45:30] this require exactly all right this one
[02:45:32] gives me 110 defeat 45 it's a
[02:45:37] monolith wait we have kazwa I feel like
[02:45:39] kazwa ventti here kind of
[02:45:46] [ __ ] everyone's saying it's so bad
[02:45:49] you're cooked okay in that case I think
[02:45:52] I should do this one but I think oh
[02:45:54] that's a monolith too whatever I think
[02:45:55] it's funny to do this one we'll just try
[02:45:57] it I think it'll be funny might as well
[02:46:00] do the harder ones we have to make this
[02:46:01] look hard no it was the worst thing ever
[02:46:04] it's really bad it's easy okay well I'm
[02:46:06] going to make it look easy
[02:46:08] anyways maybe it's hard for where's my
[02:46:11] Kaza wait wait wait wait I didn't play
[02:46:12] Kazu I didn't I saved him wait where did
[02:46:16] Kazu go
[02:46:19] wait I I didn't play him oh he's he's oh
[02:46:21] he's
[02:46:22] there I didn't see him yo I thought that
[02:46:33] was I don't know man I actually don't
[02:46:35] know how I didn't see him I'm sorry I'm
[02:46:37] actually I actually feel stupid I'm
[02:46:39] sorry it Mariah if this is a second
[02:46:41] Channel video or clippers please edit
[02:46:43] that out okay whoever's like watching
[02:46:46] this please cut that out okay um we're
[02:46:49] going to play definitely kazwa Bennett
[02:46:51] like I feel like this is really good for
[02:46:52] Mona stuff um full disclosure my kazwa
[02:46:55] C1 not C2 not C6 but C1 so have an extra
[02:46:58] ecast which is really useful uh we have
[02:47:00] Bennett Shia's really good for this for
[02:47:01] AOE but I kind of want to save Shia for
[02:47:02] harder content but Shia's better in AOE
[02:47:05] so for bosses I'd rather use a single
[02:47:07] Target character like Aro Mia uh because
[02:47:10] it's a support like we got it from a C6
[02:47:12] uh so I think we do this here or I could
[02:47:15] use yeah I could use wander as well but
[02:47:18] I think we're going to play cuz sh's
[02:47:19] broken well our Shia's
[02:47:23] broken and then we're going to do
[02:47:25] strangling no we're not we're going to
[02:47:26] put wander anyways I think we no but
[02:47:28] Shang Ling without Bennett is kind of
[02:47:30] cope so maybe we play Shang Ling well
[02:47:31] like Shang Ling wants Bennett so like I
[02:47:34] feel honestly this team's probably
[02:47:36] enough like I feel like we don't need to
[02:47:38] use sha am I coping let me
[02:47:44] think yeah I feel like this is probably
[02:47:46] enough
[02:47:51] yeah this should be fine I'm not this
[02:47:53] team order kind of sucks but what the
[02:47:55] [ __ ] it starts right

[02:55:38] Yia all right let's do that let's use
[02:55:40] Yia
[02:55:43] [Music]
[02:55:49] these areas are very cool oh I can check
[02:55:52] the map oh never mind what the [ __ ]
[02:55:54] theater Lobby
[02:55:56] theator oh I'm in the
[02:56:04] theater Ring the
[02:56:07] Alarm all right let's do it Yia clear
[02:56:09] we're using so I'm I'm mimicking we have
[02:56:11] trial characters and this is a support
[02:56:12] character we yoing from a friend who has
[02:56:14] a C6 Yia not ours but yeah we're going
[02:56:17] to do yoia and I wanna I have a theory
[02:56:22] that I want to see if I can
[02:56:24] like uh like let's say you're a new
[02:56:28] player and you borrow your friend's
[02:56:29] character I wonder if your other three
[02:56:31] can just be random dog [ __ ] for like
[02:56:33] three runs so I'm going to like I'm not
[02:56:34] saying scar is bad but I'm never going
[02:56:36] to swap into him and I'm also never
[02:56:39] gonna we'll do yo Mia with Bennett like
[02:56:41] Bennett's a good character but like you
[02:56:43] can you don't need your Bennett to be
[02:56:44] geared for him to be good so we're going
[02:56:46] to do Yia Bennett and then we won't
[02:56:47] touch the other two characters character
[02:56:49] well wait strangling cuz whatever like
[02:56:51] she's good
[02:56:55] but I'll see if this works or not I mean
[02:56:58] obviously it's C6 so should I be
[02:57:00] bursting I have remin
[02:57:02] Ence okay uh this is definitely a Yia
[02:57:05] moment of all time all good all
[02:57:08] good all right I don't know if this
[02:57:10] works
[02:57:12] but oh I need to heal so I don't lose
[02:57:14] the thing okay I'm not going to like use
[02:57:15] their abilities too much though just a
[02:57:17] little bit

[03:05:26] missing I I mean the Scrolls of destiny
[03:05:31] that through this realm in time and
[03:05:33] space make for a rather interesting read

[03:05:40] of darkness by the power of my o deang
[03:05:45] the tears and suffering described here

[03:05:52] streamer I would watch official's
[03:05:56] stream what up
[03:05:58] shun this domain is filled with mystery
[03:06:02] but one fears that we shall miss much if
[03:06:04] we are too hasty to proceed perhaps we
[03:06:07] could pause for a
[03:06:09] moment there is little of interest in
[03:06:11] this area and if we were to Wi away the
[03:06:14] time through conversation our throats
[03:06:16] would surely grow part true fashion a

[03:17:37] shouldn't shouldn't have wasted our uh
[03:17:39] my arino so early
[03:17:48] wait how many stages are there in total
[03:17:50] chat cuz you don't need all of
[03:17:56] the
[03:17:58] eight eight times what is that it's what
[03:18:01] you always need four right and it's
[03:18:03] eight just 8 * 4 which is
[03:18:05] 32 but each character divided by two is
[03:18:08] 16 cuz each character can go twice so
[03:18:10] you yeah you don't need to use everyone
[03:18:17] wait how many characters you bring I
[03:18:18] don't
[03:18:20] remember you have four uses left is it
[03:18:22] oh it's 18 yeah so you have yeah so two
[03:18:24] spare characters well four uses okay we
[03:18:27] got every
[03:18:30] Star 18 for Hard
[03:18:35] Mode you can finish the run without
[03:18:38] companion events wait how does that work
[03:18:47] wait do they regen their
[03:18:49] Vigor that would actually be really
[03:18:54] cool
[03:18:58] yep oh you get a new one oh events okay
[03:19:03] okay there's caches that can regen
[03:19:07] Vigor okay then the difficulty is still
[03:19:10] needing the characters but if there's a
[03:19:12] if you can reset or like do stuff to
[03:19:14] make sure you gain more Vigor then you
[03:19:15] might be able to cheat some clear with
[03:19:17] like less built
[03:19:18] characters which is pretty cool the only
[03:19:21] not cool part is that you need so many
[03:19:22] characters okay wait what I have to do
[03:19:24] now who do I someone said talk to the
[03:19:27] fox also I don't did I get the second
[03:19:31] dialogue for Shia I don't think I did

[03:21:07] just get it I don't know
[03:21:19] new end game ended I don't consider this
[03:21:20] end game yet like this is not like until
[03:21:23] they make it like unless they expand on
[03:21:26] it it's kind of just another combat
[03:21:30] mode but I assume they're going to
[03:21:32] expand on it but maybe that's just
[03:21:36] copium like I'm not calling this end
[03:21:38] game end game is like repeating content
[03:21:41] something you can like do non-stop like
[03:21:44] this isn't harder than a Abyss it's just
[03:21:46] more of a account check than Abyss it's
[03:21:48] more of a it's more horiz horizontal
[03:21:50] investment check and like who do you
[03:21:52] have check versus Abyss that's like
[03:21:54] vertical and two
[03:22:04] teams Quest what is this oh no

[03:23:42] hello Fang um

[03:24:29] check um why can't I configure the party
[03:24:32] I'm not in a [ __ ] oh yeah I
[03:24:34] can let's
[03:24:36] see oh wait that's not how you do
[03:24:40] it uh

[03:25:04] okay we could but I don't know if we
[03:25:07] want to there's definitely enough
[03:25:13] though it's possible someone already did
[03:25:16] did it okay because you're talking about
[03:25:17] it that makes it sound like it's
[03:25:19] impressive so now I'm going to do it so
[03:25:20] that you go you're like it's possible
[03:25:22] Zio did
[03:25:31] it time to level Amber to s
[03:25:49] hello big F hello
[03:25:50] potatoes
[03:25:54] bot all right let's do this with four
[03:25:57] stars
[03:25:58] um okay let me give this my I mean uh
[03:26:01] let me play it
[03:26:03] again yeah let's just go again
[03:26:16] are we enjoying it okay let me give my
[03:26:19] let me give my content creator take and
[03:26:22] then let me give my personal take okay
[03:26:23] there's going to be two takes here
[03:26:24] there's going to be two takes here let
[03:26:26] me do Pros into cons okay Pros are that
[03:26:30] we have another game mode that's
[03:26:31] permanent and that's combat and that's
[03:26:33] expandable on cons are like most of the
[03:26:35] other things like I think it's like a
[03:26:38] lot of the idea of it and a lot of the
[03:26:39] stuff I did I liked however I think it's
[03:26:42] in a weird threshold where it's too easy
[03:26:45] for someone like me I know I might not
[03:26:48] be the target audience but like it's too
[03:26:49] easy for someone like me and then it's
[03:26:52] too hard or impossible for not too hard
[03:26:55] but like it's too much of a character
[03:26:56] check for uh some accounts which you
[03:27:00] might think is not a bad thing and I am
[03:27:02] inclined to think it's not a bad thing
[03:27:04] but if it's certain elements where like
[03:27:06] there's not a lot of options like you
[03:27:08] get Gio maybe in the rotation or hydro
[03:27:10] which is a really good element but
[03:27:12] there's like no four stars so it's not
[03:27:13] like free to play accessible it might be
[03:27:15] more annoying because it's it's not like
[03:27:16] are you good it's more like do you have
[03:27:18] the characters do I think that's
[03:27:19] necessarily bad not really cuz it's
[03:27:22] different well kind of yes but it's also
[03:27:24] like it's a gacha so I get it like it's
[03:27:26] it's fine and like I just think it's a
[03:27:28] weird Middle Ground where I really like
[03:27:30] the idea and I enjoy content that makes
[03:27:32] me use more characters like I don't
[03:27:34] think it's bad if you force people to
[03:27:36] build more than two teams I don't like I
[03:27:37] know people like oh but what if they
[03:27:38] don't have characters like okay maybe
[03:27:40] they'll be able to do it in a month and
[03:27:41] for now you can borrow a support
[03:27:43] character and do it on medium difficulty
[03:27:44] and like you lose a little bit it's fine
[03:27:46] like whatever like I don't think it's
[03:27:47] the end of the [ __ ] world like some
[03:27:48] people like I think some people complain
[03:27:50] about it way too much but I also think I
[03:27:52] will complain about it because I think
[03:27:53] it should be a little bit it's in a
[03:27:56] weird middle ground that I don't like
[03:27:57] like I think it should be and I enjoy it
[03:27:59] like I'm enjoying it but I think it
[03:28:01] should be actually I don't know if I'm
[03:28:03] like for me it's like too easy like I
[03:28:05] could just brain off and like destroy it
[03:28:07] I think it should be either or both of
[03:28:11] these it should either be a little bit
[03:28:13] um higher level enemies like more of a
[03:28:17] challenge yes ideally it's more of a
[03:28:19] challenge and a bit less of a character
[03:28:22] check like you need 18 level 70s but in
[03:28:26] reality you don't need to use like let's
[03:28:28] say I'm fully free to play but they
[03:28:31] don't you don't need 18 level 70s if I
[03:28:34] could just like I could probably clear
[03:28:36] it with like five good
[03:28:37] characters and even right now it's like
[03:28:41] I could probably build a team like you I
[03:28:43] I did this a bit like I could do a team
[03:28:45] of like Shia let's say I have a level 90
[03:28:47] Shia I put Shia on a team the other
[03:28:49] three characters could be literally
[03:28:50] anything at this difficulty and I can
[03:28:52] clear but what if if they made it a bit
[03:28:54] harder then okay I would need to build
[03:28:56] my other characters or if they made it
[03:28:58] to where you don't need to use four
[03:29:00] characters or you get more Vigor then
[03:29:02] you could you could do that so I don't
[03:29:04] know like I kind of personally it's like
[03:29:06] whatever to
[03:29:07] me
[03:29:10] but um yeah like you do get free
[03:29:12] characters and stuff which is cool I
[03:29:15] think
[03:29:21] yeah I don't know there's a few changes
[03:29:23] I would make to it personally but I'm
[03:29:26] glad that it exists because
[03:29:28] like it's good to have another game mode
[03:29:31] that's like this I just hope it it
[03:29:34] either gets like quality of life changes
[03:29:37] which I think we should ask for and I
[03:29:38] will continue to do so uh I I'll try to
[03:29:41] formulate some thoughts of what because
[03:29:42] right now I'm just rambling uh that's
[03:29:44] one and two
[03:29:46] gets a bit harder as well like higher
[03:29:48] level enemies cuz the highest level
[03:29:49] enemy what level are they I don't think
[03:29:50] they're 100 right so that would be cool
[03:29:53] as well but but I'm glad like I think
[03:29:54] there's a lot of potential so we'll see
[03:29:57] 95 yeah Abyss is
[03:30:01] 100 but it's I don't think it's designed
[03:30:04] for the same player base as Abyss
[03:30:07] but
[03:30:12] yeah like okay here's here's my thing
[03:30:14] let's say the abyss came out today I
[03:30:16] would make a guide on it the theater
[03:30:18] came out today I'm not inclined to make
[03:30:20] a guide on it cuz like what can I say
[03:30:22] other than
[03:30:23] just like build
[03:30:28] characters but I like that it's like
[03:30:30] almost uh simulated un like it's not
[03:30:33] simil Universe it's not but I like that
[03:30:35] it's like there's like each run is going
[03:30:38] to be different and your teams are going
[03:30:39] to be scuffed which is cool like I I
[03:30:41] like that and I know some people don't I
[03:30:44] just wish it was more
[03:30:46] um either challenging or
[03:30:53] more honestly yeah I wish was more
[03:30:55] challenging okay Z like Nick there's a
[03:30:59] Nick take and there's a z take Nick as a
[03:31:01] person me I just wish it was harder I
[03:31:03] don't care if it's not like this is
[03:31:06] going to sound like toxic but like I've
[03:31:08] been playing the game for three [ __ ]
[03:31:09] almost four years give me something hard
[03:31:11] I don't care if Jimmy who picked up the
[03:31:13] game two weeks ago and is playing a free
[03:31:15] to-play no pull account uh well free to
[03:31:17] play I want to be able to clear but like
[03:31:19] two week old no pull account can't clear
[03:31:21] it I don't give a [ __ ] I want harder
[03:31:23] content now Zio content creator I'm like
[03:31:26] okay I also want it to be accessible I
[03:31:27] don't want people to be like okay I need
[03:31:29] a five star or I need more characters so
[03:31:31] I wish there would either be a bit more
[03:31:33] Vigor or more trial characters or more I
[03:31:35] could use like two of my friend
[03:31:36] characters and then you need to level a
[03:31:38] bit less characters to 70 I think that
[03:31:40] would do better for more people but
[03:31:42] personal like so I agree with that
[03:31:45] however I also as a person I'm like you
[03:31:47] know what even if I have to build 20
[03:31:49] characters as long as it's not like too
[03:31:51] restrictive which it might be You could
[03:31:53] argue it is uh I don't I just want it to
[03:31:55] be hard like just make it harder like
[03:31:57] [ __ ] it like I've been [ __ ] farming
[03:31:59] artifacts for three and a half years
[03:32:01] like I would clear
[03:32:03] content in 1.0 and people like okay you
[03:32:06] can only clear this cuz you're
[03:32:07] unrelatable and your artifacts are too
[03:32:09] good but now it's been like three and a
[03:32:10] half years so it's like you've had time
[03:32:12] to get to where I was in 1.0 Maybe not
[03:32:15] maybe just started but like you know get
[03:32:16] what I'm saying also blackl long sword
[03:32:18] what the hell is happening
[03:32:23] here it
[03:32:34] is but it's a weird thing where it's
[03:32:36] like I
[03:32:39] can't yeah it's a weird middle Zone too
[03:32:42] where it's like I asked for combat
[03:32:45] content I asked for for combat content I
[03:32:46] ask for combat content they give us
[03:32:48] combat content and then I complain I
[03:32:49] don't want it to seem like I don't want
[03:32:50] the dev to be like oh no more combat
[03:32:52] content [ __ ] you so I'm like thank you
[03:32:54] so much but could you please add this
[03:32:57] like can you like I'm glad but like can
[03:32:59] we make it better that's all that's all
[03:33:00] that's
[03:33:02] all a two we account should not be able
[03:33:04] to clear yeah yeah that's my point
[03:33:07] like it's a fine line
[03:33:10] between you like I give a bit less
[03:33:16] I care less about the character
[03:33:19] requirement than most people because I'm
[03:33:21] like you know what it's okay if you
[03:33:23] can't clear like until you get more
[03:33:25] characters and level more characters but
[03:33:27] the problem is if it's very much gacha
[03:33:29] batty where it's like okay the this week
[03:33:31] it's hydro and Gio and then Gio there's
[03:33:33] no characters and hydro they're all five
[03:33:35] stars so you kind of have to spend your
[03:33:37] Primos which is like a bit different
[03:33:39] than play the game a lot
[03:33:43] like yeah so it's it's a bit
[03:33:51] weird but like personally like again as
[03:33:55] I said me as a person if they don't
[03:33:58] change that at all but it gets harder
[03:34:00] I'm having fun like if I have to use
[03:34:02] every character I've leveled for 3 years
[03:34:05] then [ __ ] sign me up like that makes
[03:34:06] me
[03:34:08] happy it would be cool though if it was
[03:34:11] like I think okay here's my final take I
[03:34:13] think the perfect scenario
[03:34:16] I think perfect scenario is the exact
[03:34:19] okay is this but it gets
[03:34:21] harder and we just get more
[03:34:24] like either trials or the like like
[03:34:27] something to make it to where you don't
[03:34:29] necessarily need as many five stars but
[03:34:31] I mean for this one you kind of don't
[03:34:32] it's just if they change the week I
[03:34:33] don't know what the next week's going to
[03:34:34] be not harder no [ __ ] you I want it
[03:34:37] harder I don't like that's for me though
[03:34:40] that's for endgame player if this is
[03:34:41] like a mid game mode for like lower
[03:34:43] players then cool you can make it easier
[03:34:45] but for
[03:34:46] me it's just easier than Abyss but it's
[03:34:49] more of a horizontal
[03:34:51] check but you can disagree with
[03:35:06] that yeah like if it's cryo Geo anemo
[03:35:09] we're screw well okay that one there's
[03:35:11] no way they would do that but they might
[03:35:12] make something based off a reaction and
[03:35:14] also put Geo
[03:35:16] like what if they put uh Hydro Geo and
[03:35:19] then another element Clueless Okay maybe
[03:35:21] they would but if it's like hydro and
[03:35:23] then whatever like Electro cryo whatever
[03:35:25] and then they add Geo it would be a
[03:35:27] little
[03:35:32] cooked what's the worst what's the other
[03:35:34] element with the least units let me
[03:35:38] check cuz cryo has a
[03:35:40] lot although some of them are kind of
[03:35:43] like a little cope but
[03:35:47] dendro wait what would Hydro dendro Geo
[03:35:50] look like Hydro dendro
[03:35:55] Geo okay this I
[03:35:58] mean uh 1 2 3 four 5 6 7 eight nine four
[03:36:03] stars five uh 11 four
[03:36:07] stars 12 if you count MC cuz dendron is
[03:36:10] really
[03:36:11] good yeah then you would need like I
[03:36:13] mean realistically let's say you have a
[03:36:16] hydro five star cuz you know what you're
[03:36:17] doing let's say you have one of the
[03:36:19] standard Banner characters that's 14 and
[03:36:22] then you would need four more yeah this
[03:36:24] would be a bit
[03:36:28] annoying you can't use MC oh never mind
[03:36:32] 13 okay there's no way there if it's
[03:36:35] Hydro dendro Geo uninstall
[03:36:45] oh you can use MC just not aloy super
[03:36:47] hard difficulty with like cosmetic
[03:36:50] reward only and you need to complete
[03:36:52] hard for the monthly Primo oh yeah there
[03:36:54] okay there is trial characters too so
[03:36:56] assuming that let's say the trials have
[03:36:58] like maybe four or five five stars you
[03:37:00] can use let's say let's say four plus
[03:37:02] one support character friend then yeah
[03:37:04] you would be able to but also like do
[03:37:06] you even have cave and then would you be
[03:37:08] able to clear with like Yin ning Wong
[03:37:10] maybe but like I mean I guess that's not
[03:37:12] the worst example the worst example
[03:37:13] would be like I guess [ __ ] I don't
[03:37:17] know
[03:37:20] anyways wait what happened real
[03:37:24] Z oh you got put in the Asylum nice
[03:37:26] white room [ __ ] you Charlie yeah you

[03:37:38] now thanks 1,000 bits gold how about a
[03:37:40] super hard difficulty with cosmetic
[03:37:42] rewards only yes yes yes yes yes yes
[03:37:46] that's actually the like more evolved
[03:37:47] take it's make the the rewards more
[03:37:50] accessible for like freeo play players
[03:37:53] but make
[03:37:54] the Max Max Max like okay you get
[03:37:57] cosmetic or some [ __ ] way harder [ __ ] it
[03:37:59] make me grind that sh give me a pet make
[03:38:01] that as hard as you [ __ ] can I don't
[03:38:03] care just not like whale bait but like
[03:38:06] you need like insane artifacts cool I'll
[03:38:08] grind or like skill all grind people
[03:38:11] would complain yeah but like so
[03:38:19] difficulty doesn't equal fun yeah maybe
[03:38:20] not for you it [ __ ] does for me so uh
[03:38:23] suck my ball no sorry but okay like
[03:38:25] artifact checks aren't all fun like

[03:38:29] definition of fun it's more like okay
[03:38:31] cool mechanics type [ __ ] or like cool
[03:38:34] decision
[03:38:41] making but like with that said like this

[04:34:30] lucky to you and keep farming them and
[04:34:32] then let that decide your characters cuz
[04:34:33] if you do a domain that hates you you're
[04:34:35] you're going to get nowhere you're going
[04:34:36] to end up looking like [ __ ] Twitch TV

[04:37:44] this
[04:37:50] one let's play a British meme for this
[04:38:09] one Buckingham Palace has announced the
[04:38:12] death of her majesty Queen Elizabeth
[04:38:18] II
[04:38:23] oh wait this is good what the [ __ ]
[04:38:27] wait wait is this an upgrade I don't
[04:38:29] even know I mean that's oh my God why do
[04:38:32] I keep farming Vermillion if I have
[04:38:33] eight of the same perfect feathers I
[04:38:35] mean this is really good um the crit
[04:38:38] damage rules are low but outside of that
[04:38:43] 46.6 crit value and attack percent this
[04:38:46] is good what the hell this is really
[04:38:52] good wait is it better than my current
[04:38:54] piece oh [ __ ]
[04:38:57] um yes it might be actually cuz I need
[04:39:00] crit rate wait it might actually be
[04:39:09] better wait you wrong
[04:39:14] weapon wait e wrong
[04:39:18] circlet uh what's my normal
[04:39:29] builds wait 97
[04:39:33] 227 huh
[04:39:45] wait what was the circle I usually use
[04:39:46] for
[04:39:48] this is it that
[04:39:53] [Music]
[04:40:00] one wait is this the flower I usually
[04:40:02] use or do you use one with the ER I
[04:40:04] don't even know this is just an a
[04:40:06] caution moment though oh what the [ __ ]
[04:40:08] wait what is this
[04:40:15] wait this is [ __ ] lit this is funny
[04:40:18] wait I like this
[04:40:23] build I know it's wasted cuz shenyun
[04:40:26] gives you crit but it's pretty funny cuz
[04:40:28] uh dude the [ __ ] okay no disrespect
[04:40:30] but the [ __ ] at aasha don't uh factor
[04:40:33] in shenyun so you don't get like the
[04:40:35] crit raid
[04:40:37] buff okay we're not 34 but
[04:40:41] yeah there's no shanu
[04:40:43] here overal by
[04:40:49] 04 e whoa whoa whoa whoa
[04:40:54] whoa oh wait my Chin's buffed the
[04:41:03] hell wait what could I do to make it
[04:41:05] better a bit less crit rate that's not
[04:41:09] possible
[04:41:12] I mean realistically for me
[04:41:21] um this piece is better cuz I don't need
[04:41:24] CR I don't need
[04:41:26] ER or crit rate but for Akash I do so
[04:41:30] sag [ __ ] website maxing like it
[04:41:34] matters wait let me go here and go out
[04:41:37] we check our rank
[04:41:44] use Optimizer every single time I've
[04:41:47] used Optimizer for sh it's told me the
[04:41:48] exact same build I was on I'm not joking
[04:41:50] it has never given me an upgrade ever
[04:41:54] like it's fine for like normal use or
[04:41:55] other characters but for Shia it's never
[04:41:57] changed anything ever maybe now cuz I
[04:42:00] have so many pieces but like I used it
[04:42:02] literally like last time oh oops I
[04:42:04] wasted XP
[04:42:17] okay this sh build is 16 but I feel like
[04:42:19] normally I'm higher I feel like I like a
[04:42:21] 13 or
[04:42:30] something 16
[04:42:50] if you
[04:42:56] ever okay I feel like at this rate
[04:43:02] though okay I'm going to be honest I
[04:43:05] think for aasha purposes the ER is even
[04:43:07] better which is like unfortunate cuz I
[04:43:09] don't need ER
[04:43:12] cuz then we go to the 130 category and
[04:43:14] then
[04:43:18] t let me see I have to leave and go
[04:43:24] back so this is 16 let's see if we go
[04:43:29] higher get it twisted maybe we should
[04:43:31] keep
[04:43:33] gambling can you explain why you don't
[04:43:34] need the ER my shout okay regardless
[04:43:37] like I don't regardless of
[04:43:38] constellations uh like C6 he's C1 even
[04:43:42] without that Shen Yun farzon C6 fav and
[04:43:46] finina in my team Shia is Shia needing
[04:43:48] ER is liberal propaganda well it it he
[04:43:51] does but only at like yeah with like
[04:43:53] different teams at c0 and [ __ ] like yeah
[04:43:57] so my shout does not need ER like like
[04:44:00] unless I really cook the like my
[04:44:02] rotation has to be like
[04:44:04] [ __ ] Let me
[04:44:06] refresh I can't refresh for 20 seconds
[04:44:09] okay
[04:44:17] make sure all the subs are
[04:44:19] usable
[04:44:21] yeah they usually are the only bad one
[04:44:24] is my ciret but like I feel like
[04:44:26] circlets are like like I my I have
[04:44:28] better ones but I have no ER and like
[04:44:30] lower ER categories are impossible
[04:44:36] [Music]
[04:44:44] 20 wait it literally got worse
[04:44:47] hello how did it get
[04:44:51] worse how did he get where he's
[04:44:55] 20
[04:45:02] dude he got
[04:45:07] worse that's [ __ ]
[04:45:13] in my well that feather's an upgrade so
[04:45:16] uh

[04:45:28] like I literally can't wait crit rate
[04:45:31] one
[04:45:32] second filter by VV and then filter by
[04:45:36] crit crit damage oh this is the highest
[04:45:38] one this one has no attack this one does
[04:45:41] have attack but at the cost of 11
[04:46:05] ER this one gives me an attack
[04:46:09] roll what's the crit value difference
[04:46:12] 24.8 time 20 wait that's
[04:46:15] 25.6 25.6 I don't want to do math that's
[04:46:19] like
[04:46:21] 35.6 uh that's something point4 25 plus
[04:46:24] let's say 50 that's like 40.4 I think
[04:46:26] that's 40.4 I don't know I don't want a

[04:53:30] would trust you but I can't just like be
[04:53:32] like okay well it's fully your channel

[04:53:38] have perms to do that but um
[04:53:41] I wouldn't want you to be able to just
[04:53:43] like you know like I would have to have

[04:54:18] but yeah I I need to get better I need I
[04:54:20] think I need more people cuz I need to
[04:54:21] get better at delegating tasks like
[04:54:23] that's why everything's like delayed cuz
[04:54:25] like for example the arino video and
[04:54:28] like the slice strong Box video are done
[04:54:31] but
[04:54:32] like be I don't know it's always like
[04:54:34] the last part takes like a year well the
[04:54:36] the okay the the the strong video was
[04:54:38] like delayed that was on me so like I
[04:54:39] don't want to upload anymore but the
[04:54:41] other ones are just
[04:54:42] like
[04:54:44] yeah can someone edit that thinking cat
[04:54:46] meme with skeletons and Nick's saying
[04:54:48] this isn't funny what what does that
[04:54:49] even
[04:54:56] mean no like it's not it's on me is my
[04:55:00] point like okay sometime like some
[04:55:02] videos like I'll I'll like there'll be
[04:55:03] time sensitive and I'll get them late
[04:55:05] but like most of them it's my fault most
[04:55:06] of them it's like
