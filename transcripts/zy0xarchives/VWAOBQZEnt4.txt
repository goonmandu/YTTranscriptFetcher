[00:11:14] was doing is like he spoke with them
[00:11:15] once and he's carrying them around but I
[00:11:17] kind of don't know more
[00:11:18] so
[00:11:22] your purpose in life is to be in that

[00:11:35] that he was like a broken healer we'll
[00:11:37] see if that's true or not but yeah at
[00:11:39] least looks cool sounds cool
[00:11:40] aesthetically cool visually cool audibly
[00:11:44] cool so I'm excited
[00:11:48] because of him I am going to cream
[00:11:51] and I'm going to pound
[00:11:53] let me close chat oh wait this is easy
[00:11:55] s-c-o-s-e
[00:11:57] cos
[00:12:00] Coast
[00:12:10] uh Co
[00:12:15] Le cover
[00:12:21] covered
[00:12:23] is covet a word what is a covet what is
[00:12:26] a
[00:12:28] what is a covet I knew what cover I
[00:12:30] actually knew it let me look this up
[00:12:32] Covey
[00:12:35] oh yes
[00:12:38] ah yes yearn to possess or to have oh I
[00:12:43] I convey
[00:12:46] locha
[00:12:50] well that's cool
[00:12:54] that's pretty hype
[00:12:56] ranking best to worst sumeru characters
[00:12:59] oh God
[00:13:00] well I don't have a bad feeling about
[00:13:02] that
[00:13:06] you know what okay I'll take the bait
[00:13:07] all right hello we're gonna skip through
[00:13:09] it
[00:13:11] oh it's not ordered [ __ ]
[00:13:14] Dodge okay I'm not watching the whole
[00:13:15] thing
[00:13:17] yeah I'm not watching the whole thing
[00:13:18] wait what do you say about kolei because
[00:13:19] once she gets a couple of constellations
[00:13:21] like the second one and you give her a
[00:13:23] sacrificial bow she actually becomes a
[00:13:25] staple team member for new leblum teams
[00:13:27] it does take a while to perfect her
[00:13:28] playstyle into steam but I gotta say her
[00:13:30] damage her dealer and more importantly
[00:13:32] when it comes Dory the thing that she
[00:13:34] will apply tons of Electro from her
[00:13:35] burst but just like with Kali it has a
[00:13:36] weird ICD not to mention the fact her
[00:13:38] main source of electric application
[00:13:39] comes from the burst and it's super
[00:13:40] expensive you will need tons of the art
[00:13:41] to fix this problem I mean sure she's a
[00:13:42] Healer so that's fine but we also the
[00:13:44] battery forms are in every single way
[00:13:45] the most important one being is that she
[00:13:47] doesn't rely on her burst and you can
[00:13:48] just use her skill to trigger so the
[00:13:49] battery who needs the battery
[00:13:52] Omega
[00:13:55] wait is Yaya here
[00:13:58] I really love the fact we got a defining
[00:13:59] four-star character that we can pretty
[00:14:01] much put into any Central team she's got
[00:14:02] amazing healing from her burst she has
[00:14:03] great danger application and most
[00:14:05] importantly when she's using the birds
[00:14:06] she becomes a total Wacko and yeah not
[00:14:07] much needs to be said about her if he
[00:14:08] had to choose the first game yeah
[00:14:11] but when it comes what is the Jeff doing
[00:14:13] there where's the chef
[00:14:21] doesn't last that long and the part
[00:14:22] where she provides infinite resistance
[00:14:23] Interruption comes from the passive
[00:14:24] talent and it doesn't last that long and
[00:14:26] sure you can use her in monopiro but it
[00:14:28] feels almost the same way as using shiny
[00:14:29] in here and you could use her for milk
[00:14:30] on you but at the same time it's just
[00:14:31] not as reliable as xianglee or C4 yanfi
[00:14:33] or others and I know her damage gets
[00:14:35] fixed when you get more constellations
[00:14:36] and she is on the standard Banner but I
[00:14:37] don't know it feels like whoever's
[00:14:38] missed the mark with her and the funny
[00:14:39] thing is I do love using her and I am
[00:14:41] secretly hoping that her yeah
[00:14:43] all right anyways we could what we're
[00:14:46] not gonna We're Not Gonna react content
[00:14:48] to uh
[00:14:50] We're Not Gonna We're Not Gonna react
[00:14:51] content to again video when I'm trying
[00:14:53] to [ __ ] do my HSR stuff so was the
[00:14:55] video sped up because my brain doesn't
[00:14:57] work
[00:14:58] on slow speed like I can't listen to a
[00:15:00] [ __ ] so I can't I listen to myself on
[00:15:02] two times speed and I already talk fast

[00:15:09] volume shot

[00:17:33] bunch of abundance for [ __ ] luocha

[00:18:09] is [ __ ] in this game but actually that's
[00:18:10] not sure I got stealing one but most of
[00:18:12] my artifact luck has been bad but this
[00:18:14] one was good
[00:18:15] um the only thing is I have no spheres
[00:18:17] because I didn't do a single simulated
[00:18:19] Universe run off stream I don't want to
[00:18:22] it's good content so we need to do that
[00:18:23] I have no [ __ ] balls I have good wind
[00:18:26] balls good ice balls that's it nothing
[00:18:28] for Celie nothing for [ __ ] the gamer

[00:18:38] I got this yesterday
[00:18:41] or two days ago
[00:18:45] and uh now I know that when I roll
[00:18:48] pieces off stream it ends well so if I
[00:18:52] roll if if this doesn't roll well
[00:18:56] then I know it is your fault and not
[00:18:58] mine
[00:19:00] and that is a fact
[00:19:02] wait I can plus 11 it
[00:19:04] no let's not do it all the way this
[00:19:05] one's all the way

[00:20:00] or HP I am I actually am breaking up a
[00:20:02] chat I'm breaking up with chat yeah I
[00:20:04] can't roll anything on stream you're
[00:20:06] ruining my relics it's not me it's you
[00:20:08] it's not me it's you
[00:20:20] one more time
[00:20:24] okay maybe this piece is just cursed
[00:20:26] never mind
[00:20:28] maybe that's not your fault Chad I'm
[00:20:29] sorry dude I mean it could still be good
[00:20:32] like it's still fine my genuine doesn't
[00:20:34] have a good lighting set it's fine I
[00:20:36] could use that for now it's okay it's
[00:20:37] better than nothing shut the [ __ ] up my
[00:20:39] like the reason we got stuck in memory
[00:20:41] of chaos is because our we didn't have a
[00:20:42] good like rjgan was kind of [ __ ] he
[00:20:44] was kind of clapped so now we can
[00:20:46] actually like
[00:21:04] himoko like on it's not good but it's
[00:21:06] usually it could be better than the four
[00:21:07] stars because the base tax really high
[00:21:08] so like it's not good but like if you
[00:21:10] have it it's fine don't like [ __ ] it
[00:21:12] listen I know it's not great but it's
[00:21:14] okay it's better than the [ __ ] four
[00:21:16] stars I have objectively like
[00:21:18] objectively like numberedly it's better
[00:21:21] that's not great but like
[00:21:23] it is what it is
[00:21:24] not great but it is what it is
[00:21:28] but I'm not claiming about that one the
[00:21:30] bypass like what we're getting is the
[00:21:34] um
[00:21:35] what about I we're getting about
[00:21:38] password but not that one
[00:21:39] which one are we getting again
[00:21:43] I guess I could choose now
[00:21:52] um
[00:22:00] I don't know we wanted one of them but I
[00:22:02] I don't want to click the wrong one so
[00:22:04] I'll wait

[00:22:35] the one I was gonna go for this one I
[00:22:36] already have
[00:22:38] this one is very [ __ ] I'm not gonna lie
[00:22:41] and maybe like it's usable like when
[00:22:43] blades out
[00:22:46] foreign
[00:22:51] yeah this one's pretty good but I'm not
[00:22:53] gonna level a newer Edition one when I
[00:22:54] only have one edition character I use
[00:22:59] bad but Kaka yeah I mean
[00:23:02] yeah it's just attack so I can see why
[00:23:06] but this one's
[00:23:15] yeah these two I want I already have
[00:23:17] this one I'll probably get this one also

[00:24:27] oh we have double Rewards
[00:24:29] I've been waiting for this all my life
[00:24:31] so we should probably use this on world
[00:24:33] six because I need inert
[00:24:36] uh is there any difficulty I haven't
[00:24:38] cleared yet
[00:24:40] I did that I don't think I did world

[00:25:13] but I don't have it refined actually no
[00:25:16] I'm not gonna I'm just gonna use that
[00:25:17] icon
[00:25:18] um
[00:25:20] okay we're gonna play silver wolf I need
[00:25:22] to gear her or not silver uh [ __ ]
[00:25:24] what's her name silly
[00:25:26] I need to level some [ __ ] because my
[00:25:29] silly is unacceptable my ceiling needs
[00:25:31] to be needs to do better this is gonna
[00:25:34] get her damage
[00:25:35] my Yen Ching goaded my silly she's okay
[00:25:38] she's okay but we have to make her
[00:25:41] better
[00:25:42] okay never mind
[00:25:46] um
[00:25:48] boots dude These Boots are so good uh
[00:25:51] attack ones
[00:25:59] I don't have good attack ones
[00:26:03] oh darn oh shucks whatever am I see this
[00:26:06] is fine for now whatever
[00:26:15] wait but what if I could use these oh my
[00:26:17] God that would be so much better but
[00:26:18] then I would need another quantum piece
[00:26:19] like Quantum feat do I have Quantum feet
[00:26:23] I don't sag
[00:26:31] all right it's fine
[00:26:33] that's like good enough for now it'll
[00:26:35] get better our uh silver wolf has enough
[00:26:37] hit rate so she's chilling we'll change
[00:26:38] light cones eventually when I have
[00:26:39] enough XP to level the other one team
[00:26:41] Yoon is fine buy it lose fine Jun is
[00:26:43] [ __ ] we need to unfuck him uh so in
[00:26:46] order to do that we're gonna take these
[00:26:47] gloves boom I should probably use this
[00:26:48] ring on him so I could use these gloves
[00:26:49] on someone else but for the time being
[00:26:51] it's all good it's it's cool
[00:26:54] well I should give that to Ian King
[00:26:56] so I do this sizzling Thunder sizzling
[00:26:59] Thunder
[00:27:04] and then I got these boots which
[00:27:06] obviously there's no sub stats so you're
[00:27:07] gonna laugh at me haha but it's fine
[00:27:09] it'll get it while leveling up
[00:27:11] and then since we have four piece bed of
[00:27:13] sizzling Thunder Yan Ching can go on
[00:27:19] this oh my God look at that
[00:27:22] and then Circle it or hat we go a crit
[00:27:26] damage one four substance great damage
[00:27:27] we're like how four hours Mamma Mia
[00:27:30] that's only sad yanching wants on top of
[00:27:32] like attack but this is like the main
[00:27:34] set so watch this wow how did it just
[00:27:36] roll
[00:27:37] wow how did I just roll crit damage
[00:27:58] oh that's actually good that's like best
[00:28:00] case scenario
[00:28:02] uh let me unlock the other artifact
[00:28:04] where is it do I have it equipped
[00:28:08] wait where's the Hat I just [ __ ]
[00:28:09] rolled is it equipped on someone
[00:28:11] oh it's locked
[00:28:13] wait no this is the new one
[00:28:14] oh it is equipped
[00:28:19] all right one more
[00:28:22] okay that's that's fine no that's okay
[00:28:25] one one bad rule doesn't ruin the bunch
[00:28:27] you know one you know it's fine that's
[00:28:30] good that's good
[00:28:34] um don't want to throw these
[00:28:36] the engine doesn't need crit rate these
[00:28:37] are actually useless
[00:28:39] I'm not gonna cope
[00:28:45] well
[00:29:00] that's fine he likes attack this is fine
[00:29:03] he likes attacker set he doesn't need
[00:29:05] criterate overall 32.8 180 crit damage
[00:29:09] basically 100
[00:29:10] damage we are chilling okay we're
[00:29:13] chilling we can enhance this to 80. uh I
[00:29:16] think we can
[00:29:18] yeah we can but I'm gonna see who I
[00:29:20] level first so
[00:29:22] it's not even copy of if you guys say
[00:29:25] copium you're the ones coping not me
[00:29:27] I've never coped in my life
[00:29:29] dude he has blizzard Strayer think of
[00:29:31] him like ayaka what would you type
[00:29:33] copium if my ayaka had 30 crit rate no
[00:29:36] you wouldn't
[00:29:37] you wouldn't type copium with my ayaka
[00:29:39] had 30 credit right
[00:29:44] I'm taking the gamble to yep yep uh-huh
[00:29:46] yup we take the [ __ ] camera ticket
[00:29:48] yup I didn't get anything
[00:29:51] is there anything else I can break no
[00:29:57] you took the bait
[00:29:59] this is double speed
[00:30:05] no joke yeah I know yeah I feel like a
[00:30:09] thousand can be better than credit on
[00:30:10] him also I've noticed in this game
[00:30:11] there's way more damage for send Buffs
[00:30:14] compared to attack percent Buffs when
[00:30:16] you like compared to genshin like
[00:30:18] there's way more damage than Buffs
[00:30:19] Gadget has like [ __ ] Bennett noblesse
[00:30:22] Mila throwing Tails this game has like
[00:30:25] ew
[00:30:28] let's give us a lot of damage percent
[00:30:29] buff so I feel like attack percent is
[00:30:31] even more valuable
[00:30:33] then in gentian
[00:30:36] yeah bronya yeah
[00:30:37] wait no I was talking about Genji stuff
[00:30:39] not not sorrow stuff yeah startle has
[00:30:41] brania Ting Yoon and then like some
[00:30:42] light cones give damage
[00:30:45] oh
[00:30:46] I asked the two well Asic is like attack
[00:30:49] and speed so as does that counter
[00:30:51] example
[00:30:59] so that means kimoko like code is okay
[00:31:02] listen
[00:31:03] but High base attack exactly that's what
[00:31:06] I'm saying so you guys are like oh go
[00:31:07] this way because High base attack five
[00:31:09] star light cone
[00:31:12] sir invest in himoko today
[00:31:19] it's still copium but it's still it's
[00:31:22] better than some other options
[00:31:28] like you're not
[00:31:30] has a five star but
[00:31:32] but you can use it it's kind of like
[00:31:34] when I use Aquila on ayaka aquilon ayaka
[00:31:37] butterfly everyone made fun of me for it
[00:31:39] but it's like
[00:31:40] about as good and argue and usually
[00:31:42] slightly better than the free-to-play
[00:31:44] option aminoma unless you need the ER
[00:31:47] it's like about it's like like two
[00:31:50] percent better
[00:31:51] but everyone will make fun of you for it
[00:31:53] that doesn't mean it's worse so if you
[00:31:55] have it leveled you know
[00:31:56] I
[00:32:00] and I can't even change them keep at it
[00:32:07] OverWatch 2 World Cup ongoing I stopped
[00:32:09] watching OverWatch World Cup after xqc
[00:32:13] wasn't in Team Canada anymore that's
[00:32:15] when I used to watch
[00:32:18] I'm about to die so it's over
[00:32:21] I was a team Canada fan
[00:32:29] Chad do you guys think I could fight the
[00:32:31] Trotters I think I could fight the
[00:32:32] Trotters
[00:32:35] okay we're fine
[00:32:40] better late than ever
[00:32:42] thanks for the drops no worries okay
[00:32:45] sorry uh we're gonna do this wait do you
[00:32:48] guys think I could even wait what I
[00:32:50] implant on that guy
[00:32:51] I think I could kill all three so I'm
[00:32:53] gonna be greedy
[00:33:01] [Music]
[00:33:09] um I'm gonna be greedy nice I'll link
[00:33:12] your misery
[00:33:15] this guy about to dip now
[00:33:19] all right we got this dude our ceiling's
[00:33:21] [ __ ] over geared actually illusions
[00:33:22] of the past
[00:33:23] my artifacts that like my Relic centers
[00:33:25] are too high because the country but
[00:33:26] like it's actually pretty decent
[00:33:28] uh could damage speed is not actually
[00:33:31] could Dodge
[00:33:33] we got both
[00:33:43] after oh this is I mean
[00:33:45] that
[00:33:50] I've brought it you under the best of
[00:33:51] thought should I focused on her opinion
[00:33:54] um if you're only gonna use one
[00:33:57] depends on your team but generally
[00:33:58] brania
[00:34:00] okay you also have her E1 yeah
[00:34:02] but you probably want both you don't
[00:34:04] need the most investment the thing with
[00:34:05] Team Yoon is like she dies in one hit if
[00:34:07] you don't invest in her that's like the
[00:34:09] only main reason you want to like level
[00:34:10] her other than like her choices so like
[00:34:12] if you choose low investment you can
[00:34:14] still be fine but low key don't tell
[00:34:15] anyone I said this but low-key you go
[00:34:17] like a tanky set like you legit go like
[00:34:19] HP on a piece or something if you're
[00:34:20] just getting [ __ ] because like she'll
[00:34:22] still buff you and she'll still be good
[00:34:23] but if you don't have the resources
[00:34:25] invest you can like use that for a bit
[00:34:26] and then eventually go like the actual
[00:34:28] build
[00:34:29] life
[00:34:34] yeah everyone [ __ ] aggroes her for
[00:34:36] some reason
[00:34:44] you're also Ultra trailer yeah I came
[00:34:48] huh
[00:34:50] dude I used to like Alex's dreams but I
[00:34:52] swear he's just half farming now I can't
[00:34:54] watch him anymore
[00:35:00] [Music]
[00:35:02] yes but if you're dying in one hit and
[00:35:05] losing your memory of chaos or simulated
[00:35:06] Universe runs because your team even
[00:35:08] instadized then it's not worth it until
[00:35:10] you have resources like just early game
[00:35:12] I'm saying like early game if like you
[00:35:13] can't build every character to Yoon gets
[00:35:15] value without much just like keep her
[00:35:17] alive but then eventually you want to go
[00:35:18] attack yeah
[00:35:21] yeah
[00:35:23] YouTube bait
[00:35:25] can I have fun this time
[00:35:29] well what do I know
[00:35:33] I'll enter misery
[00:35:42] Pepe W not everyone can refresh fuel
[00:35:45] listen here bud okay I'm I'm literally
[00:35:48] giving a free to play accessible early
[00:35:51] game solution I have to I still run my
[00:35:54] ass on full HP so she doesn't get
[00:35:56] [ __ ] clapped by cocolia I still run
[00:35:59] her on HP
[00:36:02] I can't build every character either
[00:36:05] I don't want any of these
[00:36:07] um
[00:36:09] wow I mean this location is good I guess
[00:36:13] okay bro oh those good glue's good
[00:36:18] all right first double reward oh you get
[00:36:21] wait does this double double
[00:36:24] wait no it's the same thing it's 40.
[00:36:25] it's not condenser as and I'm stupid I
[00:36:27] thought okay it's the same thing oh
[00:36:29] oh [ __ ] wait this is kind of lit okay
[00:36:31] okay I'm hype imagine getting double
[00:36:33] Loot and all of them being bad could not
[00:36:35] be me right oh that's good
[00:36:39] no cred damage but I don't have a good
[00:36:41] lighting bolt that's good that's good
[00:36:42] that's good
[00:36:43] that sucks
[00:36:45] okay cool
[00:36:48] energy rope nope energy
[00:36:51] sounds actually good
[00:36:52] dude our genuine look look you honestly
[00:36:55] like sad watch this
[00:36:57] listen listen okay listen I can explain
[00:37:00] I actually can't explain but I don't
[00:37:02] listen this is yeah our genuine was like
[00:37:05] the problem it's not his fault it's just
[00:37:07] I couldn't yeah so
[00:37:10] we finally have an upgrade now hopefully
[00:37:12] this actually rolls into the stat I want
[00:37:14] hopefully but I know it will so that's
[00:37:17] no problem
[00:37:28] do I have enough Relic XP
[00:37:31] um
[00:37:35] um
[00:37:36] yeah we got one Attack girls we got one
[00:37:38] attack girl true Master copper in the
[00:37:40] chat we got wanna talk girl is fine
[00:37:42] surely we just get crit right here and
[00:37:44] then we're chilling
[00:37:48] I mean okay attack's not bad it's it's
[00:37:52] not bad it's fine the attack's fine it's
[00:37:55] okay it's better than nothing our crude
[00:37:56] rate's still is dog [ __ ] but or could
[00:37:58] ratio but our boots are zero now
[00:38:02] um I could go a four-star boot actually
[00:38:05] never mind I [ __ ] can't okay we'll go
[00:38:07] offset we'll go like um
[00:38:16] okay well we'll figure it out later
[00:38:18] we'll figure it one step I thought
[00:38:21] you were coping okay bro bro I don't
[00:38:24] speak in absolute I say attack percent
[00:38:27] generally is fine but on yancheng it's
[00:38:29] even better because he only wants crit
[00:38:31] damage in attack because he already has
[00:38:32] a [ __ ] on a crit rate so it's like
[00:38:34] ayaka on blizzard trigger attack percent
[00:38:36] Circle it is viable on Yan Chang attack
[00:38:38] set is great
[00:38:45] hello herdo
[00:38:49] uh give me a you know what I'm gonna
[00:38:52] gamble for a curio
[00:38:53] jeez is pretty good
[00:38:55] Omnia caps is also pretty good I'll get
[00:38:57] some cheese
[00:38:59] I hate parchment I'm a parchment hater
[00:39:05] thanks all the subs guys Zuri actors in
[00:39:07] 14 months Wing leaders are two months
[00:39:08] Maya Walker thinks of six months around
[00:39:11] there's a prime
[00:39:18] get your lives in one hour I'll probably
[00:39:20] put it on screen but I'm lazy so yeah
[00:39:31] what does cheese do uh cheese is like
[00:39:34] it's made from milk it's actually pretty
[00:39:36] tasty oh chat look what I got I ordered
[00:39:38] a
[00:39:39] I want the Foy cocoa in a shopping cart
[00:39:41] and I wanted to so I got like three of
[00:39:43] the packs for that and I didn't get that
[00:39:45] before but I got a super rod
[00:39:47] I don't know what this is but it looks
[00:39:48] cool so now I have a rod so I'm happy
[00:39:51] and everything was worth it
[00:39:54] but I will I will buy my Foy Coco in a
[00:39:56] shopping cart it's like five bucks so
[00:39:57] it's worth
[00:40:00] yo I
[00:40:05] did I not pick the hunt
[00:40:11] it's fine uh [ __ ] whatever sure
[00:40:15] abundance
[00:40:17] that was the worst Fortune glue ever no
[00:40:20] bro
[00:40:26] that should hit him right
[00:40:28] foreign
[00:40:41] tricks that uh can you go back to
[00:40:44] Vermillion no nice try though
[00:40:50] just kidding we probably will after the
[00:40:52] game live stream
[00:40:57] bro can you yeah
[00:41:01] okay what a headache
[00:41:04] rules and wonders
[00:41:07] are you still roll first
[00:41:10] I'm embarrassed
[00:41:25] should I get little chopped I mean
[00:41:27] probably wait until he's out past that
[00:41:29] but realistically he's probably gonna be
[00:41:31] the best healer so
[00:41:33] either yes or it depends if you have
[00:41:35] japard or bailu
[00:41:37] because if you have Natasha Bailey you
[00:41:39] might not need another but he's probably
[00:41:40] better than both of them so
[00:41:41] probably yes
[00:41:50] oh this is both these are fine let's do
[00:41:52] this
[00:41:55] let's do skip
[00:41:58] oh no wait we're not playing g-un oh
[00:42:00] these are so bad uh
[00:42:04] res effector is actually good we might

[00:45:15] sure sure it is
[00:45:27] double speed
[00:45:38] I should probably do
[00:45:41] I always have this situation where
[00:45:42] they're full energy I don't know what to
[00:45:43] do I think the play is this then this
[00:45:47] then this for like Optimal energy I
[00:45:50] don't know if that's true or not
[00:45:51] [Music]
[00:45:57] time for a bug
[00:46:01] [Music]
[00:46:02] I'm just gonna skill I don't care

[00:46:06] but is it no I already used
[00:46:09] it's fine we go again why the [ __ ] do we
[00:46:11] go again
[00:46:13] probably like a blessing or some [ __ ]
[00:46:15] is it yes
[00:46:23] true actually
[00:46:26] so I told you inject the Boris and
[00:46:27] reject the Run
[00:46:29] always
[00:46:43] the [ __ ] is a borison it's the hunt card
[00:46:45] we picked very good
[00:46:47] I was gonna summon his homies and we
[00:46:49] didn't use our we didn't save our
[00:46:51] hunting so that's gonna be an XD moment
[00:46:52] but we should be fine
[00:46:53] [Music]
[00:47:01] let's be friends
[00:47:07] a thousand wonders
[00:47:12] all free you've disappear among the Sea
[00:47:14] of butterflies are you the causeway of
[00:47:16] twitch shut the [ __ ] up no
[00:47:20] I'm barely the [ __ ] Mika of twitch
[00:47:23] hey guys Mika Mika of the Knights of
[00:47:26] fevonius here
[00:47:28] hey guys Faith one's pretty good
[00:47:34] okay our second extra our double one
[00:47:36] hopefully we got a energy recharge rope
[00:47:42] wait I closed the what was the
[00:47:45] I missed the sphere okay whatever we'll
[00:47:47] check the sphere later
[00:47:48] wait what was it the right set I didn't
[00:47:50] even see it
[00:47:53] I didn't mean to close it
[00:47:57] uh kiro's probably not worth this late
[00:48:00] in the run but I'm not just like maybe
[00:48:01] I'll get like a robe or something uh
[00:48:11] ah [ __ ] it
[00:48:13] I remember these fine
[00:48:20] are you the John Cook of twitch I mean
[00:48:22] they they call me that but like I you
[00:48:24] know it's no big deal I don't really see
[00:48:25] it it's no big deal uh it had some
[00:48:27] blessing that's good there you go take
[00:48:29] that boom regrets
[00:48:32] next to the drop no worries
[00:48:36] the RR is four percent drop rate really
[00:48:39] yikes yeah I knew it was really rare but
[00:48:41] that's actually ass I might um I might
[00:48:43] use the
[00:48:44] the like guaranteed mainstab thing from
[00:48:46] the bow pass on that
[00:49:03] we're just upgrading oh I have robe I
[00:49:05] forgot maybe I should upgrade everything
[00:49:06] uh it's still worth the upgrade though
[00:49:10] because we could do two and only lose
[00:49:12] one right because 140 yeah so we could
[00:49:13] do crit damage and probably speed
[00:49:24] all right cool
[00:49:26] poggers
[00:49:28] ready when you are do you remember I'll
[00:49:30] hide them both but if I have to pick
[00:49:32] I'll hide them
[00:49:42] trickier to craft
[00:49:44] this combat needs Optimum speed
[00:49:49] good shot no sauces in chat no leaks no
[00:49:54] sassy no nothing okay we don't do that
[00:49:57] I'm just gonna say I feel like every
[00:49:59] region is gonna have their ahitham so
[00:50:01] it's gonna be a very confusing time for
[00:50:03] all of us so please bear with me during
[00:50:05] this process that's all I'm gonna say
[00:50:07] that is all I'm gonna say that is all
[00:50:09] I'm gonna say no more if I have to say
[00:50:11] any more if I have to say anymore
[00:50:17] illusions of the past
[00:50:21] oh [ __ ] I thought I was on Bilu

[00:50:46] a tall male character that looks kind of
[00:50:49] like that not like identical but like
[00:50:50] similar vibe
[00:50:57] I know Ina Zuma's but I feel like if I
[00:50:59] speak I'm in big trouble so I'm not
[00:51:00] gonna say it
[00:51:08] Chick-fil-A
[00:51:17] this combat needs oh should I use teams

[00:56:55] XD okay we'll probably do the only one I
[00:56:57] need is quantum wait what if I craft a
[00:56:59] special Quantum no but I should craft an
[00:57:01] ER rope right
[00:57:07] um

[00:57:24] get it yet

[00:57:37] though but it's fine we go again they do
[00:57:39] five did
[00:57:42] um
[00:57:59] what do you think three or six
[00:58:07] what if we do world one
[00:58:25] oh to be fair we still need a hit rate
[00:58:28] ball
[00:58:29] uh I mean not uh number we need a
[00:58:32] [ __ ] uh ER rope on this set but we
[00:58:35] could probably craft one
[00:58:44] um yeah
[00:58:58] because they're doing a god-free unchang
[00:59:00] me yeah I have but I don't know yet
[00:59:04] should we fight gephard

[00:59:27] a hunt angle
[00:59:34] oh Gamble
[00:59:35] if you can gamble you don't pick the
[00:59:37] Gamba actually why

[01:01:17] I mean I like seals seal is cool
[01:01:31] cool
[01:01:47] listen I that was like the worst run
[01:01:50] everything about that runs okay let's do
[01:01:52] a quick world five run we haven't done
[01:01:54] our six six five we have no five in a
[01:01:56] while we have enough actually if I do
[01:01:58] four I get bonus rewards look at this if
[01:02:00] I do four look at this I get free first
[01:02:02] time clearing because I haven't done
[01:02:04] four four

[01:02:12] um
[01:02:22] only thing is my Jun is kind of uh
[01:02:26] mid so we need to fix that
[01:02:33] I don't know how these boots actually
[01:02:35] suck I don't use those on him
[01:02:44] yeah maybe we could start by giving him
[01:02:46] a rope that's not dog [ __ ]
[01:02:49] it's fine
[01:02:55] thank you
[01:03:06] these two pieces are good but like the
[01:03:07] rest is like like this is so [ __ ] bad
[01:03:09] and then I don't even have like a good
[01:03:11] off like other two piece that could go
[01:03:12] unless I go Eagle of Twilight line
[01:03:18] so it's kind of copium
[01:03:21] okay maybe we don't put him I'll just
[01:03:22] [ __ ] brute force it I guess Saj
[01:03:38] carry out you take that big Lotto again
[01:03:41] we take that three times in a row surely
[01:03:42] this time it'll actually help us
[01:03:49] fox is like subscribe welcome welcome
[01:03:53] 36 minutes
[01:03:55] the predictions uh I'm just hoping to
[01:03:57] see a Fontan teaser because you know how
[01:03:58] like before for Inazuma but also what I
[01:04:02] remember more is recently for the desert
[01:04:04] thing when they released like new desert
[01:04:06] in sumeru they kind of like sat us down
[01:04:08] like dalway pulled up he was like yo and
[01:04:10] then he like they like sat us down and
[01:04:12] we saw like preview of like the region
[01:04:14] so surely we get that for French land
[01:04:16] surely that would be cool but they
[01:04:18] probably will do that next last year not
[01:04:20] this one but surely we got something for
[01:04:21] this one I don't know maybe a little
[01:04:22] teaser maybe they like they tickle our
[01:04:24] balls a little bit like a little teaser
[01:04:26] uh uh these all suck I'm probably not
[01:04:29] gonna Shield
[01:04:31] you have follow-up attacks no but I
[01:04:33] might get something cool
[01:04:34] okay
[01:04:38] that's that's okay
[01:04:47] oh yeah drip marketing and four oh true
[01:04:50] we're gonna get a 4.0 drip marketing yo
[01:04:53] I can't wait
[01:04:56] I can't wait I actually can't wait
[01:05:00] what if they don't what if the drip
[01:05:02] marketing for 4.0 is just like
[01:05:08] another Clevelander
[01:05:11] foreign
[01:05:27] I mostly hyped for any Harbinger where
[01:05:29] we get to play any harbinger of hype and
[01:05:31] if we uh well I know we will but
[01:05:32] whenever we do and I'm hyped for the
[01:05:34] Hydra archon
[01:05:38] and whatever the um whatever I go see
[01:05:41] the others but yeah
[01:05:48] I'm just waiting for the community's
[01:05:50] reaction when we find out that Capitano
[01:05:52] was a reckless palette all along order
[01:05:54] Guff I haven't quite figured out yet
[01:05:56] it's either legoff or
[01:05:59] um it's either the Guff or Reckless
[01:06:02] palette but I'm not sure which one yet
[01:06:04] okay yeah
[01:06:06] chaos
[01:06:08] who said we're skipping 3.9 actually
[01:06:10] they did so this is not leaks at all
[01:06:12] when you look at the official gentian
[01:06:14] impact like a Dev update thing they said
[01:06:17] in 3.8 this is happening and in 4.0 this
[01:06:20] is happening why didn't they mention 3.9
[01:06:22] I don't know but it's easy to Guess that
[01:06:24] hey maybe after 3.8 we might get 4.0
[01:06:26] true
[01:06:41] you think hydrocar will be a nahida on
[01:06:43] The Meta level no okay hydrocon's
[01:06:45] probably gonna be really good there's no
[01:06:46] way they make her bad okay obviously but
[01:06:50] maybe clueless but the the thing with
[01:06:52] Nikita is like two dollars how many gift
[01:06:55] to diffuse still doesn't get a rerun
[01:06:59] [ __ ] 50.
[01:07:00] okay listen
[01:07:02] if you let us look at a rerun I will eat
[01:07:04] an entire sock on stream but that's not
[01:07:05] gonna happen anyways that's not the
[01:07:07] point
[01:07:08] um
[01:07:09] the thing with the heel is like okay so
[01:07:11] dendro's just a broken element right now
[01:07:13] at least for the content we have so
[01:07:15] dendro MC is really good but that's what
[01:07:17] MC isn't inherently better than like a
[01:07:19] Nemo MC it's just dendro's really
[01:07:21] [ __ ] good and Animo already has
[01:07:22] sucrose cause of aventi [ __ ] Gene
[01:07:24] like whatever right and the thing with
[01:07:26] dendro is like Nikita came out and it
[01:07:27] was just like way better than every
[01:07:28] Denver option like way better
[01:07:31] so it's like
[01:07:33] and now we have so many good [ __ ]
[01:07:35] Hydro characters that unless [ __ ] up
[01:07:37] like like the the Hydra icon is like
[01:07:40] unless the Hydra icon like like she'll
[01:07:43] they'll probably be met up but like the
[01:07:45] odds of them replacing a hydro character
[01:07:46] is very little but the odds of them
[01:07:48] being either a slight upgrade or are
[01:07:49] good with them like a like another
[01:07:51] option or like slightly better or like
[01:07:53] good in Hydro teams that's pretty high
[01:07:59] it'll probably have like it'll probably
[01:08:01] enable like my guess is she'll enable
[01:08:03] monohydra teams and or she'll be like a
[01:08:07] really good healer but probably not
[01:08:08] because I have kokomi so it'll probably
[01:08:10] be something with like bubbles I'm a
[01:08:12] slime Theory you know the Slime theory
[01:08:13] that the archons all do something of the
[01:08:15] slimes she's gonna be a bubbles really
[01:08:17] like a bunch of hydro bubbles that's
[01:08:19] gonna be funkalore
[01:08:25] and then it stun's enemies C sees them I
[01:08:28] should not claim this right yeah no
[01:08:52] uh what am I curious right now oh these
[01:08:55] are actually pretty good yeah I kind of
[01:08:57] but these two suck parchment sucks at
[01:08:59] the boss and big Lotto is dead prism is
[01:09:02] good robe is good I'm kind of down to

[01:09:05] pretty good too

[01:09:51] take that unlock I never get unlocked
[01:09:52] anymore
[01:09:54] probably should have read it though
[01:10:14] but you have winning Masters Tokyo dude
[01:10:16] I'm coping so hard Friday dude I watched
[01:10:19] I I missed a lot of the tournament but
[01:10:21] like yesterday or two days ago I watched
[01:10:23] both na games and both of them ended no
[01:10:26] okay spoilers but like both have ended
[01:10:28] third like one game from overtime and
[01:10:31] someone threw like it is what it is
[01:10:32] they're like dude it was I actually am
[01:10:34] coping it was one game from overtime
[01:10:36] twice
[01:10:39] but I also like PRX I think they're very
[01:10:41] fun to watch so I don't really care but
[01:10:43] I just need n a to win one thing we've
[01:10:45] been losing too much dude everyone did
[01:10:46] we've actually been losing time we need
[01:10:47] one game where we don't suck okay one
[01:10:49] game one game
[01:10:51] we're a [ __ ] joking League we're a
[01:10:53] joke in healthcare we're a joke in most
[01:10:55] things but we need to have valorous so
[01:10:58] surely surely I was I was t i was NRG is
[01:11:01] probably my favorite but they lost so
[01:11:03] I'm I'm All EG now
[01:11:05] I like prx2 though
[01:11:09] I like Sonic but then they started
[01:11:12] winning too much now like okay you've
[01:11:14] had your you've had your [ __ ] time to
[01:11:15] shine okay boaster's cool but like
[01:11:19] [ __ ] you oh
[01:11:24] an A1 TFT World wow TFT worlds
[01:11:41] I actually like TFT though
[01:12:07] what's up
[01:12:10] butterflies is there any popular game
[01:12:12] where Nas yeah dude against an impact
[01:12:15] dude literally get it back to na we have
[01:12:17] me we have the Jeff what do you need we
[01:12:20] win gets an impact worlds
[01:12:25] dude what more do we need
[01:12:36] yeah I mean technically smash too but
[01:12:37] it's not like like Melee especially is
[01:12:39] mostly on any like it's it's just like
[01:12:41] less popular in other regions
[01:12:45] also I think the only reason why NA was
[01:12:48] on top at the start of valorent was
[01:12:50] because EU was playing [ __ ] was
[01:12:53] playing CS though they still are so like
[01:12:55] they the they had it caught up like the
[01:12:58] all the good players were flakes yes
[01:13:01] double speed
[01:13:03] but it's okay we'll catch up
[01:13:19] come on
[01:13:21] this is double speed
[01:13:34] cop okay but like I feel like
[01:13:38] okay I don't know I haven't followed or
[01:13:40] watched the Esports till until since
[01:13:42] like last time I was watching was like
[01:13:43] when
[01:13:44] San Francisco shock was the best it's
[01:13:46] been a while but like like the like it's
[01:13:48] been like a few years but
[01:13:51] is it like OverWatch League more
[01:13:53] relevant than World Cup like I feel like
[01:13:54] OverWatch League was like and like the I
[01:13:56] don't know yeah
[01:14:00] I mean neither of them are relevant but
[01:14:21] ready when you are
[01:14:30] how's World Cup not relevant I mean I
[01:14:32] guess it is my point was only just like
[01:14:34] I feel like the team's playing like the
[01:14:36] entire year
[01:14:38] in like a whatever format and then
[01:14:40] finals is like more
[01:14:42] kind of shows more of the best players
[01:14:45] than one tournament once but like I get
[01:14:48] that world comes a bigger thing so sure
[01:14:50] but like I don't know that's how I
[01:14:52] viewed it at least
[01:15:11] butterfly
[01:15:33] this is double speed
[01:15:44] yeah we'll probably finish this
[01:15:45] installed again because uh it's like 20
[01:15:48] minutes away

[01:18:16] how did I get nothing
[01:18:18] okay this run is actually [ __ ] we

[01:19:07] I mean honestly I think we will get you
[01:19:08] later on oh I should have [ __ ]

[01:19:11] this one oops whatever
[01:19:14] ready when you are
[01:19:20] balls
[01:19:22] that's a super try the super I think

[01:19:26] it's all the different currencies so I
[01:19:28] don't know what the [ __ ] is what but I
[01:19:29] appreciate it
[01:19:32] I think it's a new future
[01:19:34] [Music]
[01:19:37] send your strings welcome customers
[01:19:42] a thousand wonders
[01:19:49] copying YouTube yeah
[01:19:52] the worst part is um like it's fun like
[01:19:55] it's so cool I think but the main thing
[01:19:57] that's annoying is um
[01:19:59] everything that's not donos gets like a
[01:20:03] pretty big cut that goes to Twitch like
[01:20:04] it's fine but like I feel like they're
[01:20:06] trying to kill off donors
[01:20:08] which is kind of sucks
[01:20:13] it's like what they did with gift Subs I
[01:20:15] don't know what they're doing with this
[01:20:15] I think which is like kind of weird but
[01:20:19] whatever
[01:20:36] why are they both on Ting Yoon
[01:20:41] oh don't worry Tian won't get targeted
[01:20:44] haha
[01:20:49] this is double speed
[01:20:54] can I ignore the odds surely sure like
[01:20:56] in Brute Force this right surely
[01:21:03] this is probably a mistake
[01:21:06] it was definitely a mistake
[01:21:08] but I'm down
[01:21:11] in the doctor
[01:21:18] fine
[01:21:20] wait I'm actually fine because I do this

[01:22:02] thought I had enough because I don't
[01:22:10] fine
[01:22:13] that's fine

[01:23:18] all right nice World completed so we
[01:23:20] should get some rewards just for that
[01:23:22] although world four kind of sucks but it
[01:23:24] is what it is Boom
[01:23:29] okay
[01:23:31] wow that was uh useful
[01:23:35] and we got an unlock
[01:23:46] okay let me get ready for the gentian
[01:23:48] live stream so I'm going to change my
[01:23:50] game category to ganshin impact
[01:23:57] foreign
[01:24:02] guys I appreciate it
[01:24:18] try a lodge dungeon in the meantime no
[01:24:21] surely not
[01:24:23] I'm excited for three brain I'm excited
[01:24:24] to explore if there's a new region from
[01:24:26] the teaser we saw but other than that
[01:24:28] I'm hyped for 4.0 like mostly
[01:24:33] because that thing gets bored like it's
[01:24:35] fun but it gets boring after a bit
[01:24:36] usually
[01:24:39] but what do I know nothing
[01:24:45] Let me refresh their page
[01:24:48] will Hydro traveler be good how the [ __ ]
[01:24:51] do I know I'm here's my prediction of
[01:24:53] hydro traveler e is gonna be some
[01:24:55] utility like kindness healing thing like
[01:24:57] small healing and then burst is gonna be
[01:24:59] damaged I don't think they're gonna make
[01:25:00] Hydro traveler a full healer I might be
[01:25:02] wrong but I don't think so especially
[01:25:03] because Barber is free but the skill
[01:25:05] might be a bit like sincho-esque where
[01:25:07] there might be like a little bit of
[01:25:08] healing
[01:25:09] and then the burst will be damaged
[01:25:11] that's my guess maybe full-on healer
[01:25:13] maybe I'm just guessing a little bit of
[01:25:15] healing but maybe like a HP scaling
[01:25:17] burst that's my guess
[01:25:30] log into gentian yes sir
[01:25:36] there you go
[01:25:41] just for you let me close my sorrow
[01:25:48] fell straight to the prime that's our
[01:25:51] trade
[01:25:56] want to set a new traveler they give you
[01:25:57] freezing troll oh I would take that
[01:25:58] absolutely absolutely what the [ __ ] dude
[01:26:02] give me that
[01:26:12] I wish they Implement like new outfits
[01:26:15] per region though I think Travelers
[01:26:16] should have a different outfit every
[01:26:17] region I know it's like a very
[01:26:18] mainstream take but like I think dude
[01:26:20] like why the [ __ ] can we not just look
[01:26:22] different we've been through F we've
[01:26:24] been to [ __ ] eight different
[01:26:25] continents we're literally going to
[01:26:28] Paris
[01:26:29] let me [ __ ] wear a beret
[01:26:32] it's fine though
[01:26:35] trolley level 90 then though because
[01:26:37] especially Hydro one's probably gonna
[01:26:38] scale on HP I probably should but
[01:26:41] whatever
[01:26:43] C6 I don't even know
[01:26:46] um
[01:26:52] reaction crowd skinny there's a prime
[01:26:55] wait I [ __ ] my other stuff maybe
[01:26:56] there's a two months the only Mars is
[01:26:58] eight months appreciate it guys but
[01:27:00] what's this 11.

[01:27:06] new Hydro reaction we're getting cement
[01:27:08] we're getting a lightning storm uh and
[01:27:11] we're getting
[01:27:12] um
[01:27:13] we're getting
[01:27:15] um
[01:27:16] we're getting steam which is like a
[01:27:19] lighter version of vaporize it's just
[01:27:20] gonna be steam
[01:27:22] which is what happens when you use hydro
[01:27:24] and Pyro uh but not on an enemy so like
[01:27:27] you Ben and ALT infuses yourself then
[01:27:29] you like Barbara Hydro around you on you
[01:27:31] and then it like steams and then it
[01:27:33] Buffs you it Buffs your hydro and Pyro
[01:27:35] damage by 50 percent
[01:27:41] hangover things in four months
[01:27:53] are we getting cold veggie yeah we're
[01:27:55] gonna get frozen vegetables
[01:28:02] Trust
[01:28:12] wait what would Geo and dendro be like
[01:28:14] uh Rocky Mossy rock is that yeah I think
[01:28:17] Mossy rock is what I called it what else

[01:28:21] leafy leafy Mountain

[01:46:46] Alice with the fairy tale will reveal
[01:46:48] first and
[01:46:50] action
[01:46:52] okay
[01:46:54] exact location of bottle land can't be
[01:46:57] found on any map its very existence can
[01:47:00] be difficult to prove
[01:47:02] but I know of a mage who once used her
[01:47:04] magic powers to leave bottle land
[01:47:09] the little Mage was practicing her magic
[01:47:11] as the grand Mage had instructed okay as
[01:47:14] usual she started slacking off during
[01:47:17] her practice okay
[01:47:18] she already knew the grand mage's magic
[01:47:21] tomes from cover to cover and she
[01:47:23] stumbled on some strange incantations in
[01:47:26] the newer books
[01:47:27] teleportation
[01:47:29] okay oh
[01:47:31] I'm gonna visit every Kingdom that I
[01:47:33] read about in The Storybook the little
[01:47:35] Mage was very brave and confident so she
[01:47:38] was not afraid of venturing out on her
[01:47:40] own in fact she believed that the bad
[01:47:43] guys were the ones who should be afraid
[01:47:45] of her okay the bad guys noted okay
[01:47:46] after taking a few moments to compose
[01:47:48] herself yeah she began to recite the new
[01:47:51] magic spells she had just learned okay
[01:47:56] the god of Fortune was evidently looking
[01:47:59] after her this is going to be on the
[01:48:01] exam guys listen operation the little
[01:48:03] bottle and Mage left her home
[01:48:06] no it really
[01:48:08] really amazing the little Mage seemed
[01:48:11] like a child in a candy shop with an
[01:48:13] endless amount of Mora in her pocket
[01:48:15] okay she was excited to try all the
[01:48:17] different incantations she found as if
[01:48:20] they were different flavors of candy
[01:48:22] given Nation Magic
[01:48:24] when spring water drops down pure and

[01:53:03] shall we continue our performance yes
[01:53:06] please welcome back everyone let's
[01:53:12] legend of the magic bottle
[01:53:16] wow
[01:53:18] of course there were Travelers who found
[01:53:21] and entered bottle land [ __ ] Mike is
[01:53:23] squeaking most Travelers chose to remain
[01:53:25] there there were also some who decided
[01:53:27] to return to their homelands
[01:53:29] but there accounts of bottle land
[01:53:32] whereas very different
[01:53:34] if you ask me oh it's been too long
[01:53:36] since I've left that place
[01:53:38] [Music]
[01:53:42] um
[01:53:43] shouldn't we call it the Valerian Mirage
[01:53:48] welcome back deer night okay
[01:53:52] we're in Bottle land oh
[01:53:56] okay yep yep
[01:54:00] that's good
[01:54:03] first of all
[01:54:04] of our main events that's actually cool
[01:54:06] free Layla plus Kyle especially unusual
[01:54:09] if you missed the kai skin you're dead
[01:54:11] to me place inside a bottle located
[01:54:13] somewhere in the desert
[01:54:21] Travelers will be able to collect them
[01:54:23] to obtain some rewards including Kaya's
[01:54:27] new outfit
[01:54:29] I need to get that all right
[01:54:33] yes well since it's the desert I think
[01:54:35] it's safe to assume that we'll be seeing
[01:54:37] a variety of terrain you think uh I hope
[01:54:41] the vouchers won't be hidden in some
[01:54:42] extremely hard to reach places
[01:54:46] surely we can surely surely we won't
[01:54:49] have to do the entire event for the skin
[01:54:51] so I could get on my other account I'm
[01:54:52] in their search
[01:54:53] so for example it looks kind of fun
[01:54:55] though you can use these crystals to
[01:54:57] help us locate vouchers more easily
[01:55:00] and in addition to collecting vouchers
[01:55:03] bottle land also has many unique
[01:55:05] attractions absolutely okay so first up
[01:55:09] we have the pre-prints hmm
[01:55:13] well there are streaming projectors
[01:55:15] scattered throughout the Valerian Mirage
[01:55:17] it's said that if you place an object in
[01:55:20] the projector then you can construct a
[01:55:22] corresponding item based on its original
[01:55:25] shape and the power of your imagination
[01:55:28] okay
[01:55:31] yeah exactly but there is does that
[01:55:34] looks sick I feel like it does but I
[01:55:36] haven't gone to see much of it it can
[01:55:37] only just a certain two
[01:55:39] potential objects called a pre
[01:55:41] there's all the Falls brother
[01:55:43] traveler bin the street the street
[01:55:44] projector to end
[01:55:47] okay some changes
[01:55:49] [Music]
[01:55:53] we might encounter some obstacles
[01:55:58] imagine you could call them you can just
[01:56:00] fight
[01:56:02] it'd be pretty cool
[01:56:04] which will then allow us to pass through
[01:56:07] that sounds awesome sounds super fun
[01:56:09] success yeah yeah I can't wait to give
[01:56:11] it a try yeah right that's pretty cool
[01:56:13] in addition to the pre-prints we'll also
[01:56:15] have a fun and new way to get around you
[01:56:18] might even be able to call it a game
[01:56:20] mode it's called the choo choo cart yeah
[01:56:23] so with the choo-choo cart travel wait
[01:56:26] Mario Kart two car stations in various
[01:56:28] areas of the valoria Mirage
[01:56:30] oh oh my gosh this is so cool it's so
[01:56:35] fun I love this it's like a little baby
[01:56:37] amusement park but not really baby it's
[01:56:39] going to give me a headache
[01:56:41] for sure
[01:56:49] but next we have some event mini games
[01:56:53] [Music]
[01:56:57] so get ready for this guys because this
[01:56:59] one's got a long name so its technical
[01:57:01] name is the crocomorph vortex based
[01:57:04] crocodilian armored heavy Naval
[01:57:06] Battleship style recreational water
[01:57:07] blasting Cannon
[01:57:11] it's an epic Fame
[01:57:12] I think my head hurts
[01:57:17] well apparently it said that hey mobs
[01:57:20] accurate reflection wait I've actually
[01:57:22] gone at this okay we are this is lit
[01:57:24] apparently I've never missed a shot in
[01:57:26] my life so
[01:57:28] it uses stored ammunition to fire Hydro
[01:57:31] Bubble Blast
[01:57:33] because I know some of you will be
[01:57:34] concerned about this the hydro bullets
[01:57:36] that it fires are safe and their use for
[01:57:39] leisure purposes only Safety First yep
[01:57:42] and once it's out of ammunition it will
[01:57:44] take a certain amount of time to reload
[01:57:46] its Supply absolutely but if you need to
[01:57:50] we can also manually reload it at the
[01:57:52] right opportunity
[01:57:53] [Music]
[01:57:54] okay use the cannon to hit as many of
[01:57:58] the target balls as you can within the
[01:57:59] time limit to earn points yeah there are
[01:58:02] also different types of Target balls to
[01:58:04] aim at these include order Normie tiny
[01:58:06] Vantage brouhaha overdrive and dual
[01:58:09] charge Target balls should we be noting
[01:58:12] this down
[01:58:13] overdrive that's quite the list yeah
[01:58:16] some some fun names in there huh
[01:58:19] a notable tile is the overdrive ball so
[01:58:23] Travelers can break it to enter an
[01:58:24] enhanced State during which you will
[01:58:26] gain infinite ammo
[01:58:29] also take it right so when your bullets
[01:58:33] hit the targets in this state they will
[01:58:35] cause damage in a larger AOE Travelers
[01:58:38] will definitely have a blast with this
[01:58:40] mechanic so give it a shot
[01:58:44] let's shoot for the stars
[01:58:47] I'll be here all day thanks for coming
[01:58:50] so next up we have sojourns of The
[01:58:55] Barking Fox [ __ ] I hate soldiers will
[01:58:58] have to control the Barking Fox to reach
[01:59:00] the destination within the time this
[01:59:02] looks kind of cool though they'll also
[01:59:03] have to collect as many Adventure coins
[01:59:05] as possible while moving the fox
[01:59:07] actually maybe not I don't know yet the
[01:59:09] coins are projections you can pass
[01:59:11] through oh it looks so great
[01:59:19] which can obstruct traveler's sight
[01:59:20] players will also encounter disruptor
[01:59:23] orbs which emit disruption waves but
[01:59:25] these disruption waves don't seem like
[01:59:27] they're dealing any real damage dude
[01:59:29] what even are we I guess we're a soldier
[01:59:31] so these disruption waves they won't be
[01:59:34] damaging The Barking Fox it's kind of
[01:59:36] cute sensor that reduces the remaining
[01:59:38] time of the challenge as well as your
[01:59:39] score so our little barking Fox buddy
[01:59:42] will be safe
[01:59:42] [Music]
[01:59:44] now guess what our next mini game is
[01:59:55] that totally sounds like a game for Eula
[01:59:58] right oh it is actually cool it's
[02:00:00] monsters it's probably fun but it's
[02:00:02] actually a combat mini game it just
[02:00:05] happens to take place on a stage and
[02:00:07] some of the game mechanics have been
[02:00:08] inspired by theater trying for you guys
[02:00:10] to make fun of me for not clearing in
[02:00:12] three seconds so before
[02:00:16] just their party to fit the special
[02:00:17] features of the different stages okay
[02:00:20] cool you can defeat opponents to
[02:00:22] accumulate honed will and once you've
[02:00:24] gathered enough you'll obtain honed
[02:00:26] Focus effects
[02:00:29] why is she so fast wow she's just
[02:00:32] zooming what the [ __ ] yeah it's Gotta
[02:00:35] goal right
[02:00:40] yeah that's one of the Buffs you can get
[02:00:42] that's pretty epic it's a consuming I
[02:00:45] love this
[02:00:46] house
[02:00:47] the thing the circles don't get 40K and
[02:00:49] then they swap to clean the like 8K
[02:00:52] like one game of this mini minions
[02:00:57] [Music]
[02:01:02] what
[02:01:03] what huh wait what the [ __ ] is this any
[02:01:05] game is called bang bang
[02:01:09] I've got a finch fact
[02:01:18] the rebound to X accelerate oh so this
[02:01:23] cute little detail is one of The
[02:01:24] Inspirations perfect it's actually
[02:01:26] curling yeah dude this is Canadian we're
[02:01:29] going to be launching a certain number
[02:01:31] of Finch balls
[02:01:32] place as many Finch balls as you can in
[02:01:34] high scoring zones and reach the set
[02:01:36] scores to complete the challenge what
[02:01:39] the [ __ ] is that yep and you'll need to
[02:01:41] know this I mean it's new code that I'm
[02:01:43] down
[02:01:44] so if the finch ball stops inside the
[02:01:47] Red Zone you will earn four points if it
[02:01:50] stops within a yellow zone okay Red Zone
[02:01:52] two points Four Points
[02:01:57] yeah
[02:01:59] so you're going to want to press the
[02:02:00] launch button at the right time to set
[02:02:03] the direction before entering the
[02:02:04] charging sequence
[02:02:06] release the button to launch the
[02:02:07] baseball in the corresponding Direction
[02:02:10] so I know it may sound safe now that
[02:02:14] there's some finesse to getting it right
[02:02:16] okay this looks fun this looks like the
[02:02:19] game you send on like iMessage in like
[02:02:21] the [ __ ] game like the bird thing and
[02:02:23] then you like play with like a friend
[02:02:25] balls wait there's so many levels oh I
[02:02:28] love that
[02:02:29] yeah game pigeon is giving it a little
[02:02:32] hug oh that's so cute it's adorable it's

[02:07:12] is called shared site in this event
[02:07:16] Travelers will assist a researcher who
[02:07:18] is collecting experimental data we will
[02:07:21] need to use imagine we could pet the
[02:07:22] animals described mirror to find and
[02:07:24] recover small animals in order to
[02:07:26] complete the experiment okay that's
[02:07:27] pretty cool what Travelers may use the
[02:07:30] device linked to the inscribed mirror to
[02:07:32] view the environment from the animal's
[02:07:33] point of view use the information
[02:07:36] to figure out their location and
[02:07:38] Recovery you just killed them the second
[02:07:40] event is called perilous Expedition wow
[02:07:46] adventurers study sumeru's geography and
[02:07:49] hydrology but despite its name this will
[02:07:52] actually be a combat event cool I love
[02:07:55] playing combat me too that's cool I like
[02:07:57] combat events usually event a new area
[02:07:59] will unlock for us to explore each day
[02:08:01] and we'll need to fight our way through
[02:08:04] each exploration consists yeah if the
[02:08:08] team compositions are probably like a
[02:08:09] super like than a stack event focused
[02:08:11] like fun patch and then exploration has
[02:08:14] different challenges this will be a
[02:08:16] great chance for players to test yo this
[02:08:18] looks like my team when God you first
[02:08:19] came out and I wanted to try like
[02:08:21] actually no I I I don't know it's called
[02:08:24] adventurers trials Advanced the branch
[02:08:28] Master of the monstat adventurers game
[02:08:30] has prepared new challenges to help
[02:08:32] train rookie adventurers
[02:08:34] in the sequential trials you will need
[02:08:36] to pass three consecutive trial
[02:08:38] challenges in a single run as for
[02:08:40] fortuitous trials three trial challenges
[02:08:43] will be randomly generated
[02:08:45] I actually like a variety of fun mini
[02:08:48] games such as flying and collecting
[02:08:50] Adventure coins while dodging attacks
[02:08:52] kicking slimes into the goals I wish
[02:08:55] there were more last time and or it was
[02:08:56] a bit harder but like it was still fun
[02:08:58] oh I love King slimes my favorite
[02:09:02] but that's not all Todd's genius
[02:09:04] invocation TCG will also be receiving an
[02:09:07] update
[02:09:15] available in version 3.8 different
[02:09:18] stages I think if we have like actual
[02:09:20] hard PVE I'm hyped for it but if it's
[02:09:22] like easy I don't care
[02:09:24] opponents to increase your score
[02:09:26] okay I get it so Travelers will need to
[02:09:30] pit their well-constructed decks against
[02:09:32] endless waves of enemies for a set
[02:09:34] amount of rounds the more enemies you
[02:09:37] defeat the more points you earn that's
[02:09:39] right there's a Candace card well that

[02:12:06] [Music]
[02:12:16] what she lacks in size she makes up for
[02:12:19] in her sense of justice
[02:12:22] bolstered by her convictions she patrols
[02:12:25] lives by herself if if anyone suspicious
[02:12:29] appears such as an unknown Outlander
[02:12:34] oh Hydro to watch their every move wait
[02:12:38] but before anything's Justice occurs but
[02:12:42] just little melazine that's kind of sick

[02:12:49] what the [ __ ]
[02:12:55] the [ __ ] that's actually how you
[02:12:59] but if you look at the crowd standing
[02:13:02] Outlander isn't careful and finds them
[02:13:04] can I adopt the pet seal
[02:13:05] misunderstanding
[02:13:07] then we can let the Court decide there

[02:13:18] little bit longer like why don't you

[02:17:13] get a real job no I'm kidding
[02:17:16] yeah might not be playable I don't even
[02:17:18] [ __ ] know might just be an NPC if
[02:17:19] it's NPC like Pom-Pom that's kind of
[02:17:21] cute actually I take back everything I
[02:17:23] said if it's like Pom-Pom because she
[02:17:24] looks like a train conductor so she's

[02:19:02] think he got shot by something oh this
[02:19:04] I don't know maybe the exploration thing
[02:19:06] though it looks like an exploration
[02:19:07] thing doesn't look like his abilities
[02:19:09] foreign
[02:19:22] teaser video for 10 seconds of footage

[02:19:29] I know what this pink thing is
[02:19:33] also I didn't say I hate kids
[02:19:36] I don't like playing a character that's
[02:19:38] a toddler The Only Exception is I think
[02:19:40] nahid is a cool character but usually
[02:19:42] like I'd rather play a tall Giga chat
[02:19:46] you literally said that whatever I'll
[02:19:48] double down
[02:19:59] I agree actually
[02:20:10] is this Japanese

[02:22:04] the kitty next to the pink child is so
[02:22:07] cute where
[02:22:09] oh the [ __ ] when she was like here bro
[02:22:12] there's just a random cat I can find 10
[02:22:15] of these in game now
[02:22:17] you've probably swirled one off a cliff
[02:22:19] with a gene

[02:24:42] pretty cool
[02:24:44] [Music]
[02:24:49] a little aranara chilling with Scara
[02:24:53] I feel like initially I was like I want
[02:24:56] scared to stay a villain but I feel like
[02:24:57] they kind of did his like
[02:24:59] troubled boy who needs therapy and then
[02:25:01] nahida adopts some art pretty well
[02:25:03] because it turned out it was just datori
[02:25:04] being a [ __ ] a Vermin so I hope they
[02:25:07] just don't give dattari Redemption
[02:25:09] notorious just evil which is cool like
[02:25:12] yeah oh they just keep the Torah evil
[02:25:15] like if you try not I would be pissed if
[02:25:18] they didn't but
[02:25:19] I will
[02:25:20] [Music]
[02:25:24] no the tour is like like scar is just
[02:25:27] like unlucky life
[02:25:29] and he took it out on people because
[02:25:31] he's like a child who needed therapy and
[02:25:33] a hug but like the tour is like actually
[02:25:35] beyond evil like the story is like
[02:25:37] invented evil like Kaya's ancestors
[02:25:44] do the carry Bear Quest
[02:25:49] foreign
[02:26:04] [Music]
[02:26:16] I want to play them yeah I want to play
[02:26:17] them too but I also want him to die like
[02:26:19] I want a character to be playable but
[02:26:21] also dead
[02:26:22] he needs to die in the story he's
[02:26:24] literally the [ __ ] he's literally the
[02:26:26] like Ultra evil terrorist of gentian
[02:26:29] like he has to die but I want him to be
[02:26:31] playable I think he's sick I hope he's
[02:26:33] playable like I like I think he looks
[02:26:35] cool definitely evil though
[02:26:37] definitely do not condone his actions
[02:26:41] but I want to play him
[02:26:47] also I got this as soon as the stream
[02:26:49] started this is actually pretty good
[02:26:50] right
[02:26:51] I mean it's HP but
[02:26:57] playable Senora dude Senora would still
[02:26:59] sell well look at her it doesn't matter
[02:27:01] it doesn't matter if a character is dead
[02:27:02] if you can play her and she looks cool
[02:27:03] people will still [ __ ] swipe I don't
[02:27:06] care one of my cookie run Kingdom

[02:27:30] design is lame okay but her I'm not even
[02:27:33] gonna argue that I'm just gonna say her
[02:27:34] design would sell regardless
[02:27:37] like look at her I like objectively okay
[02:27:39] even if you know nothing about her even
[02:27:41] if you don't know nothing about genjin
[02:27:42] you could be a normie and you would
[02:27:44] consider playing the game or looking at
[02:27:46] senoras
[02:27:47] [Music]
[02:27:54] she must sing
[02:27:56] Ma

[02:28:21] I'm afraid to scroll down I'm actually
[02:28:24] afraid
[02:28:30] [Music]
[02:28:38] okay I mean I'm happy with this I'm
[02:28:40] actually happy with this live stream
[02:28:41] overall the pat 3.8 looks fun like it's
[02:28:44] gonna be a bit filler near the end but
[02:28:45] it's a [ __ ] ton of fun events while
[02:28:46] waiting reruns which whatever take it or
[02:28:49] leave it if you want Eula you want to
[02:28:50] clear you want scar you want to call me
[02:28:52] you're happy if not it is what it is but
[02:28:54] like the events are cool you can save
[02:28:55] your previous looks hype
[02:28:58] so okay the [ __ ] skin is the best I
[02:29:01] think Kai's Skin's the best part clear
[02:29:02] if you play CLE but like Kaya skin oh my
[02:29:04] God I guess I'm gonna make a new Kaya
[02:29:06] guide so stay tuned for that I guess but
[02:29:09] I I'm high
[02:29:13] who plays Clee there's like five people
[02:29:16] in chat
[02:29:17] apparently half my mod team does every
[02:29:18] time I ask that like four mods show up
[02:29:20] and are like me so
[02:29:22] but yeah
[02:29:26] foreign
[02:29:31] I guess you just type five times
[02:29:41] um
[02:29:42] okay let me let me roll this piece [ __ ]
[02:29:43] it in honor of this live stream it's our
[02:29:46] first Fontan piece
[02:29:53] okay how
[02:29:56] much I think
[02:29:57] things live stream ends the stream like
[02:30:00] it was the Fontan teaser and the n a
[02:30:01] side and then it ended right it was
[02:30:03] supposed to end
[02:30:05] right here boom ends I think for na I
[02:30:08] don't think we get extra stuff but I
[02:30:09] think what they do is they try to end it
[02:30:11] at the right time but there's delay on
[02:30:12] Twitch and stuff if I press and stream
[02:30:14] mid-sentence it's gonna be like and
[02:30:16] it'll end so I think they just end
[02:30:19] stream when the video ends but there's
[02:30:20] delay like just like play it a bit
[02:30:22] longer and then end but it's fine yeah
[02:30:24] maybe it's like a YouTube view farming
[02:30:26] or something I don't know
[02:30:28] like yeah
[02:30:31] test it now I'm not ending streams
[02:30:34] there's all the new phones guys I
[02:30:36] appreciate it
[02:30:37] yeah I'm excited I'm really excited like
[02:30:40] very excited every time I see new again
[02:30:42] it's like they know how to tickle your
[02:30:45] balls a little they know how to tease
[02:30:46] you to where you're like missing like
[02:30:48] they know how to like make you overseas
[02:30:50] should be like I need a break and then
[02:30:51] right when you're at that point they
[02:30:52] draw you back in by showing you
[02:30:54] something and then 3.8 you're gonna be
[02:30:56] like you're gonna be like halfway
[02:30:57] through like oh I don't care too much
[02:30:58] anymore and then boom Fontan teaser is
[02:31:00] gonna come out
[02:31:01] and then 4.0

[02:44:37] uh keep in mind though before you guys
[02:44:39] make fun of my event scores because you
[02:44:40] always compare me to streamers we did a
[02:44:42] full point all of these first try just
[02:44:43] saying just saying the last one we
[02:44:44] removed the Nemo damage was because I'm
[02:44:45] not a whale but I'm just saying just say
[02:44:47] thanks for being here guys this was two
[02:44:49] streams today wow I love you all
[02:44:52] seriously means a lot that you're here
[02:44:53] and I'm high for 3.8 and I'm especially
[02:44:55] high for 4.0 so
[02:44:57] uh I'll probably ask my second Channel
[02:44:59] editor Mirai the Giga Chad to make the
[02:45:02] live stream reaction into video so if
[02:45:04] you missed it or want to watch it that
[02:45:05] should be on the second Channel within a
[02:45:07] day or two
[02:45:08] and I'm making a Beto guide for the main
[02:45:10] Channel right now it's almost done and
[02:45:12] I probably should be doing a bit clear
[02:45:13] now but it is what it is
[02:45:15] a lot of background noise it's probably
[02:45:16] ends soon I don't know what the [ __ ]
[02:45:17] happening
[02:45:18] um but yeah beta guide and I'm probably
[02:45:19] gonna make a Kai guide as well well not
[02:45:21] now I'll wait till the Skin's out for
[02:45:22] footage because it looks better but
[02:45:24] that's gonna happen now
[02:45:26] um
[02:45:28] yeah there's actually background noise
