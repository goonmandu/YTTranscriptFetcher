[00:16:54] they have to be like
[00:16:56] immortalized like like like yeah
[00:17:05] like can you just get tattoos removed
[00:17:07] you but I don't want to do that dude
[00:17:08] look at me I'm borderline too afraid to
[00:17:11] get a tattoo I don't want have to go
[00:17:12] through removing it no immortalize like
[00:17:15] like Lincoln Park cuz like okay Chester
[00:17:17] is the goat and like well I think so but
[00:17:19] like he's you know it's
[00:17:22] like his legacy's already
[00:17:26] solidified there's no room for
[00:17:33] anyways welcome to the
[00:17:35] stream they have to die first they don't
[00:17:37] have to die but it's like if they're
[00:17:39] still alive what if tomorrow I find out
[00:17:42] they're a bad person and then I have
[00:17:43] their logo on my arm what the [ __ ] do I
[00:17:47] do I'm not
[00:17:54] parasocial cut your arm off you have to
[00:17:57] die no no no no no I
[00:18:06] don't turn off chat to get your point
[00:18:08] across that's not a bad idea but because
[00:18:11] everyone's just drama farming with chat
[00:18:13] on I feel like I'm going to keep chat on
[00:18:14] I'm not going to drama Farm but it's a
[00:18:17] fair game like I I gotta look if you're
[00:18:19] in the pig pen you got to do what the
[00:18:20] pigs do I'm sorry not calling anyone a
[00:18:22] pig you're all cool I guess or not I
[00:18:25] kind of don't care
[00:18:31] what up John oh yeah I met John this uh
[00:18:35] weekend I don't know what day it is I'm
[00:18:38] it's a blur yeah weekend he was a
[00:18:41] [ __ ] loser no he was nice he was nice
[00:18:43] the only flaw of his is he plays uh John
[00:18:46] impact he plays Chong y but I say
[00:18:52] that what's the DM leaker drama there's
[00:18:55] none it's just this happens every few
[00:18:57] months every few weeks in every
[00:18:58] Community this isn't genin this isn't
[00:19:00] about a specific person you're thinking
[00:19:01] it is I just think DM leaking in general
[00:19:03] is cringe unless it's like like this guy
[00:19:06] confess to a crime or it's like you you
[00:19:08] need you need it to like prove something
[00:19:10] that's like very important but when it's
[00:19:13] just like w you're a bad friend it's
[00:19:15] like oh suck my balls man like okay yeah
[00:19:20] so I is the Jeff is my friend I haven't
[00:19:23] hung out with him in like a year I'm a
[00:19:25] bad friend I know okay I know
[00:19:32] that's actually funny
[00:19:34] though anyways uh Chad welcome to the
[00:19:37] stream um let's get this stuff over with
[00:19:40] so if you didn't see I tweeted
[00:19:42] this okay I kind of was like I don't
[00:19:44] want to tweet anything but then FK
[00:19:46] tweeted this and I was like I was
[00:19:48] literally listening to youh for I was
[00:19:50] like I kind of want to post this so I
[00:19:51] posted it um people laughed some people
[00:19:54] were like dude this is toned that can
[00:19:57] you address the accus
[00:19:59] you know like I get that they're like on
[00:20:01] my side but like brother if it's nothing
[00:20:04] serious why do I have to be serious like
[00:20:05] I'm going to be serious because it's
[00:20:07] worded this is my main issue with this
[00:20:10] is uh okay well I'll scroll to my part
[00:20:11] later but it's worded in a way that
[00:20:13] makes it seem very
[00:20:15] serious when it's [ __ ] that's very like
[00:20:17] resolved privately two years ago it's
[00:20:20] you know it's nothing that should be
[00:20:22] talked about right now I will talk about
[00:20:23] it I'm going to give you guys full
[00:20:24] context because you deserve to know
[00:20:25] about it given that it's a thing now but
[00:20:28] it's like it it went from being it went
[00:20:31] from being about hey like this person
[00:20:35] might feel bad to oh well this is up the
[00:20:38] like fight for the public opinion
[00:20:40] now it's worded so [ __ ] up yeah dude
[00:20:42] it looks I was talking to people about
[00:20:44] this it made it seem like I like [ __ ]
[00:20:46] assaulted someone bro do you know what I
[00:20:49] do you want to know what it is do you
[00:20:50] want to know what it it's literally I
[00:20:53] literally invited someone and then I'm
[00:20:55] okay let me oh my God I'm okay let me
[00:20:57] get into it also
[00:20:59] I have to say this is a big disclaimer
[00:21:01] like make sure to listen to this
[00:21:03] part before I talk about what I'm angry
[00:21:06] about or what I don't want I don't want
[00:21:07] to be angry but what I'm bothered by I
[00:21:11] have to say this is a very important
[00:21:13] disclaimer I do genuinely feel bad for
[00:21:15] ASU I think he's been through a lot of
[00:21:16] [ __ ] I think a lot of stuff that's
[00:21:17] happened is unfair to a lot of different
[00:21:19] people uh I'm glad he's still with us I
[00:21:21] think there's a lot of [ __ ] up things
[00:21:23] that have happened okay this is like
[00:21:25] fully true and I also think that he
[00:21:27] worded this in a very State I've had a
[00:21:29] lot of friends that have been suicidal
[00:21:31] and or depressed I've been in Dark
[00:21:33] Places I get it and I I you know that's
[00:21:36] [ __ ] and I don't want people to bully
[00:21:37] people for
[00:21:39] that however because he was I believe he
[00:21:43] was in an emotional state I'm going to
[00:21:44] pause my Spotify I think it caused him
[00:21:46] to word things incorrectly Fang don't
[00:21:48] say me I think he worded things
[00:21:51] incorrectly uh or at least in a way that
[00:21:54] makes things seem significantly worse
[00:21:56] than they are and I mean I I know know I
[00:21:58] was there and also it like when he was
[00:22:01] talking about it like I watched this
[00:22:02] well I didn't watch the stream but my
[00:22:03] editor was like yo you should watch his
[00:22:04] Stream So I watch his stream like he was
[00:22:06] talking about like oh I wasn't there but
[00:22:07] and then bra like or bra tweeted about
[00:22:09] or like I talked to bra like I'm not
[00:22:11] like flaming him but like he like posted
[00:22:13] wait what the [ __ ] oh yeah he posted St
[00:22:15] he's like oh I wasn't wait where the
[00:22:17] [ __ ] did he change the
[00:22:18] document oh yeah he moved it whatever he
[00:22:20] was like I wasn't there uh but and it's
[00:22:23] like bro do you know who was there me
[00:22:26] why are you guys talking I'm sorry I
[00:22:29] well actually I heard a rumor and then
[00:22:31] they like exaggerate it and it's not
[00:22:32] even close to what it is it's like bro
[00:22:34] like no disrespect genuinely no
[00:22:36] disrespect but like I get it it's not
[00:22:38] easy for you you're going through a lot
[00:22:40] and I do feel like I genuinely feel bad
[00:22:42] but it's also
[00:22:45] like
[00:22:49] hello anyways also
[00:22:53] uh did Brax delete his first Google doc
[00:22:56] cuz I kind of need it for something I I
[00:22:58] would dude they weren't there also the
[00:22:59] people that were there like I know
[00:23:01] people that were there and I contacted
[00:23:02] those people like yeah it's fine like I
[00:23:04] contacted the person invol like I'll get
[00:23:06] into it but like he deleted it oh
[00:23:16] great wake up in the
[00:23:21] morning okay I'm going to look up the Mt
[00:23:23] review I don't care
[00:23:36] yeah I know what U said chat like I'll
[00:23:39] talk about
[00:23:41] it I don't know if I need this video or
[00:23:43] not but I want to have it open just in
[00:23:45] case people are saying like all right
[00:23:50] anyways I will start by
[00:23:56] clarifying I want to clarify a few
[00:23:58] things one again he's in an emotional
[00:24:00] state so I'm not blaming him for certain
[00:24:02] wording second don't harass people I
[00:24:05] don't care if you like them or not don't
[00:24:07] be a dick I don't like the like drama
[00:24:09] farming oh this guy is a [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:24:11] and then the other one's like no this
[00:24:12] guy should die it's like just I I don't
[00:24:14] care like chill but these this is worded
[00:24:18] in a very serious way where it makes it
[00:24:20] seem like it's something that it's not I
[00:24:21] have friends who
[00:24:24] are okay I have to be careful with my
[00:24:26] wording
[00:24:28] I have friends who
[00:24:31] are like victims of serious things and
[00:24:35] they're like yo why does this sound why
[00:24:37] is this written like it's something
[00:24:38] serious and I was like dude it was
[00:24:39] literally just this and they're like oh
[00:24:41] why was it worded like that and I'm like
[00:24:44] I don't
[00:24:45] know and so because this is a thing now
[00:24:48] we have to talk about
[00:24:52] it okay so again disclaimer emotional
[00:24:56] state whatever now moving on
[00:24:58] uh I don't know if I want to read this
[00:25:00] all but I mean I I can like I it's
[00:25:03] [ __ ] he said alphabetical order and
[00:25:05] my name is zedy z and then an X so I
[00:25:08] kind of [ __ ] myself over now it's at
[00:25:10] the bottom it's fine to Zs I've told you
[00:25:14] this in person but I feel like you've
[00:25:15] matured a lot over the past two years oh
[00:25:16] also everything here the one it's only
[00:25:19] one thing by the way the the thing here
[00:25:21] is two years ago just so we know and
[00:25:22] it's resolved privately everyone moved
[00:25:24] on well the two people moved on cuz it's
[00:25:26] only two people it's me and one other
[00:25:27] person it's not like it's a big anyways
[00:25:29] two years ago I've told you this in
[00:25:31] person but I feel like you've matured a
[00:25:33] lot over the past two years since me and
[00:25:34] you an expo which is like matured since
[00:25:37] then cool you and I are both aware that
[00:25:39] I've gone out of my way to clean up
[00:25:40] after you for a certain issue which I
[00:25:42] don't know if I agree with but I'll read
[00:25:43] and then we'll get into it but when I
[00:25:44] found out uh although he has help like
[00:25:47] I've talked to him but when I found out
[00:25:48] I was getting accused by Brax phone and
[00:25:50] people behind the scenes uh saying I was
[00:25:51] protecting you over things I was
[00:25:53] completely unaware of I was pissed also
[00:25:56] for the record I did talk to bra we'll
[00:25:58] get into it but he even said here also
[00:26:00] silence to he said this is not true he's
[00:26:02] not silence like anyone like I made sure
[00:26:03] this wasn't true I'm like dude like and
[00:26:05] I I asked like I talked to him so we're
[00:26:08] cool on that front it is admitted that
[00:26:09] it's either a lie or a misunderstanding
[00:26:11] I'm not going to say lie I don't want to
[00:26:13] cause [ __ ] misunderstanding cool I told
[00:26:16] you recently face to face in La that he
[00:26:18] seemingly had dirt on you and your
[00:26:19] reaction to this inform information was
[00:26:21] extremely disappointing to me do you
[00:26:23] know how this conversation went okay to
[00:26:25] be fair I'm going to take ownership I
[00:26:27] think I [ __ ] up a bit for something
[00:26:28] but it literally was like oh yeah these
[00:26:30] people are spreading rumors about you am
[00:26:32] I supposed to be happy I was mad yeah I
[00:26:34] was mad I was like what the [ __ ] like
[00:26:36] what is okay well I wasn't mad it was
[00:26:38] more so let me word this carefully it's
[00:26:40] like if these rumors are like if it's
[00:26:42] something that's true or relevant I
[00:26:45] would want to know about it and make it
[00:26:46] right like I would want to know what it
[00:26:48] is I would want to do better whatever
[00:26:50] but if it's something that's like either
[00:26:51] wrong or just like very exaggerated of
[00:26:54] something that's like irrelevant then
[00:26:56] it's naturally going to Warrant like a
[00:27:00] okay what like he literally was just
[00:27:01] saying oh he well he has dirt on you he
[00:27:02] was reference to you it was like very
[00:27:03] vag like what is it that's why he's like
[00:27:05] oh is it ex why I was like I was asking
[00:27:07] like a million questions cuz like what
[00:27:08] is it who's saying this why are they
[00:27:10] saying this like what is it about like
[00:27:11] because I don't if someone comes up to
[00:27:12] like this person has dirt on you are you
[00:27:14] not going to be like what is it who is
[00:27:15] it like can I talk to someone is it okay
[00:27:17] do I have to make it up like do I have
[00:27:19] to apologize do I have to like I want to
[00:27:20] know what the [ __ ] it is but anyways you
[00:27:23] repeatedly emphasize how you would never
[00:27:24] side with me publicly regarding drama
[00:27:26] this I lowkey regret saying but I I I I
[00:27:29] I'll talk about it yet you wanted me to
[00:27:31] clarify things and relay information to
[00:27:32] you it felt like a stop in the face ask
[00:27:33] why is z I don't know and I'm not your
[00:27:35] messenger this was like insult injury I
[00:27:36] already know very well you care deeply
[00:27:37] about your Public Image and you try to
[00:27:39] specifically try to avoid all forms of
[00:27:41] drama and I never uh expected you or
[00:27:42] ever asked you to side with me publicly
[00:27:44] at all your comments are unnecessary
[00:27:46] okay do you know why I don't do drama my
[00:27:49] viewership is probably going to Peak
[00:27:51] today I could Farm drama all day but
[00:27:53] that's not who I am I just want to play
[00:27:54] games and have fun a lot of people try
[00:27:55] to drag you into drama a lot of people
[00:27:56] try to farm it and I respect the drama
[00:27:58] Farm is you know good for you I've been
[00:27:59] on a thumbnail of a lot of videos you
[00:28:02] know I have I mean shout out I mean you
[00:28:03] know we shout out it is what it is and
[00:28:05] like that's fine that's cool but it's
[00:28:07] not my type of content and I'm going to
[00:28:09] go as far as saying I don't like that
[00:28:10] type of content I think some of it's
[00:28:12] fine some of it's disingenuous it's not
[00:28:13] what I do okay this is not what I do and
[00:28:16] he knows that everyone knows that it's
[00:28:17] not a secret it's not like oh oh [ __ ]
[00:28:19] like oh your Public Image it's like yeah
[00:28:22] I don't want to be seen as like a bad
[00:28:23] person or like it's and it's also like
[00:28:25] if I make a mistake I want to know I
[00:28:28] want to own up to it and I want to make
[00:28:29] sure that whoever's involved feels okay
[00:28:31] like I want to resolve it like a normal
[00:28:33] human not like oh well let's just air
[00:28:35] this [ __ ] out public anyways let's keep
[00:28:38] talking I don't want anything to do with
[00:28:39] whatever skeletons you may or may not
[00:28:40] have in your
[00:28:43] closet I'm not going to play spooky
[00:28:45] scary skeletons that would be uh
[00:28:48] copyrighted I do not want have anything
[00:28:50] to do with every skeleton you have in
[00:28:51] your closet you need to worksh out with
[00:28:52] bra's phone privately and you know
[00:28:53] what's crazy I did talk to bra but it's
[00:28:56] not about me and it's not about him it's
[00:28:59] a situation where that doesn't involve
[00:29:01] it's not like this is why it's like oh
[00:29:03] you have to resolve it with him it's
[00:29:04] like well if he's spreading rumors again
[00:29:06] I'm not going to accuse anyone I'm not
[00:29:07] going to say he was or wasn't if he was
[00:29:10] that's [ __ ] but why and if it's like
[00:29:14] if what the Situation's about we'll talk
[00:29:16] about it's not about him it's also not
[00:29:18] about it's about a person and that
[00:29:20] person like is who should matter anyways
[00:29:23] from my understanding neither of you
[00:29:24] have made any efforts to contact each
[00:29:25] other over it and plan to sweep it under
[00:29:27] the rug we didn't sweep on the rug I
[00:29:29] actually resolved the [ __ ] situation
[00:29:30] I just wasn't aware there were rumors
[00:29:32] until you told
[00:29:33] me which is going to lead to more rumors
[00:29:35] spreading I hope this will prompt you
[00:29:37] guys to communicate and squash whatever
[00:29:38] this beef is again no beef because I
[00:29:40] refuse to deal with this or take any
[00:29:42] form of responsibility for it later down
[00:29:43] the line I am sorry for the grief this
[00:29:45] might cause you but I'm genely sick of
[00:29:46] getting drag for other people problems
[00:29:47] and that's it likewise to Jake no no no
[00:29:49] I want to play osrs
[00:29:51] whatever okay I'm going to go in detail
[00:29:55] but first let me say
[00:29:58] uh we'll talk about the rumors I I think
[00:30:00] the order in which I'll do it is I'll
[00:30:02] say what happened then I'll say what the
[00:30:03] rumor was then I'll explain that and
[00:30:06] then I will conclude on talking about
[00:30:08] why I didn't defend him publicly or why
[00:30:10] I told him I wouldn't even though he
[00:30:11] didn't expect me to and
[00:30:14] then did I write anything down I don't
[00:30:16] think so no I think that's it okay
[00:30:28] top how's your shirt a conscious Choice
[00:30:29] dude I I I I've been waiting this for
[00:30:31] four days I didn't sleep I'm sorry um I
[00:30:33] just I've been running around okay I
[00:30:35] I'll talk I'll talk okay I'm going to
[00:30:37] keep this brief cuz it's going to get
[00:30:38] clipped a lot out of context so I have
[00:30:39] to make sure every word I say is
[00:30:41] accurate but I need you to understand
[00:30:43] like F at a fundamental level that the
[00:30:46] way this is worded makes it seem
[00:30:48] like it is extremely exaggerated and
[00:30:52] this is my main
[00:30:53] issue um it's worded like oh there's
[00:30:56] some [ __ ] serious that like oh [ __ ] like
[00:30:59] that that he knows about you do you know
[00:31:01] what happened let me paint a picture
[00:31:03] first of all my first like big official
[00:31:04] event I went to I went
[00:31:07] toyc um like kind of undercover with
[00:31:09] Julie like we just chilled but then I
[00:31:11] went to enim Expo and that was like my
[00:31:12] first big event and I was with a bunch
[00:31:14] of people and it was fun for the most
[00:31:16] part I was a bit like Dumber cuz it was
[00:31:18] my first time and I've learned a lot but
[00:31:20] here's the entire thing that happened
[00:31:23] okay okay let me actually be serious
[00:31:26] here's the entire thing that happened so
[00:31:27] I
[00:31:28] there was like a house party that was
[00:31:29] happening at an Airbnb there were people
[00:31:31] that were invited I didn't I was just
[00:31:33] there and it was fun everything was cool
[00:31:35] then we were talking to a few people
[00:31:36] that were already there they left to go
[00:31:38] to something a dinner an event
[00:31:41] whatever and then one of the people that
[00:31:44] I was like like we were talking to uh oh
[00:31:46] actually they said like oh we'll
[00:31:47] probably come back after or we may come
[00:31:49] back after something like that and then
[00:31:50] I was like they left and then this is 2
[00:31:53] years ago mind you and then I uh
[00:31:55] afterwards a bit later I was like oh I
[00:31:57] damned one of person just only one
[00:31:58] person I was like like by the way are
[00:32:00] you coming back like you know like it
[00:32:02] was it was fun whatever and they were
[00:32:03] like oh I'd love to but like maybe it's
[00:32:05] too late or anything I'm like oh like no
[00:32:07] pressure but if you want to come we're
[00:32:08] still like chilling right like everyone
[00:32:09] it was it wasn't just me it was like 20
[00:32:10] people I don't know the exact amount but
[00:32:12] it was a lot of people we were just
[00:32:13] chilling big place so they're like okay
[00:32:17] cool they came over um but what happened
[00:32:19] was this is where I'm trying to take
[00:32:21] some
[00:32:22] accountability I think I inadvertently
[00:32:24] invited more people than I had thought
[00:32:27] because they came with their friend and
[00:32:28] that's fine but two things first of all
[00:32:31] I only invited them and second of all I
[00:32:35] had asked the person who organized the
[00:32:36] party I'm like 99% sure it was U but I
[00:32:39] don't want to like I don't care who it
[00:32:40] was cuz my memory from two years ago is
[00:32:42] a little [ __ ] but like I remember asking
[00:32:43] U yo can I invite them back they were
[00:32:45] already here he's like yeah of course
[00:32:46] but if it wasn't U it was like someone
[00:32:47] else my point is just I asked the person
[00:32:49] before inviting them but that's not the
[00:32:51] point the point is they came over and
[00:32:53] then that's the issue oh no wait wait
[00:32:54] wait wait I'm getting there and then so
[00:32:56] the person came and that was fine but
[00:32:58] their friends I think it was two or
[00:33:00] three I I genuinely was not talking to
[00:33:01] their friend I don't know who they are
[00:33:03] their friends uh came but they were like
[00:33:05] a bit too drunk like their friends were
[00:33:08] uh kind of piss drunk the person I
[00:33:09] invited wasn't and then those people
[00:33:12] ended up and wait till you see the big
[00:33:14] reveal they ended up leaving the area
[00:33:16] where the party was at and they entered
[00:33:18] uh an area where like people were
[00:33:19] sleeping and they opened a door and
[00:33:21] barged in to accidentally like they
[00:33:23] didn't mean harm I'm not blaming them
[00:33:24] but they were too drunk and they opened
[00:33:26] a door where people were sleeping and
[00:33:27] then uh they basically like everyone got
[00:33:29] kicked out now to add something I will
[00:33:32] say when they did get kicked out I
[00:33:33] thought it was just them so and the
[00:33:35] person I invited kind of felt really bad
[00:33:37] this is where I feel bad they felt
[00:33:39] really bad um and they were sad about it
[00:33:42] cuz they thought they ruined everything
[00:33:43] they're like [ __ ] like I'm friends with
[00:33:44] these people I ruined everything my
[00:33:46] friends ruined everything and I felt
[00:33:48] like [ __ ] about it because and I I tried
[00:33:50] to tell them like no like you don't have
[00:33:52] to like like I said like you guys don't
[00:33:53] have to leave just like the people that
[00:33:54] whatever but then I think the person
[00:33:56] that was in charge I think it was also
[00:33:57] like no everyone else so I kind of
[00:33:58] contradicted that but you know my bad
[00:34:00] but anyways I was like it's okay like
[00:34:01] and then like they felt really bad and
[00:34:03] they left and I dm' them I was like hey
[00:34:05] I'm like right away I was like hey I'm
[00:34:08] really sorry like I didn't mean to cause
[00:34:11] you any harm or make it like uh like you
[00:34:14] didn't do anything like I tried to make
[00:34:15] it clear you didn't do anything wrong I
[00:34:16] apologize a few hours later the same
[00:34:18] night they said no it's okay you don't
[00:34:20] have to apologize I was like yes I do
[00:34:21] and I apologized and then literally the
[00:34:23] next day I reached out again and
[00:34:25] everything was fine and since then we've
[00:34:27] been fine we've were friends we've been
[00:34:28] reaching out this is 2 years ago two
[00:34:30] years it's fine we've been friends since
[00:34:32] we've been you know we talk from time to
[00:34:34] time we're cool I even reached out again
[00:34:35] today just to make sure because I didn't
[00:34:37] want to go on stream and say hey like
[00:34:40] we're cool and I genuinely was like
[00:34:41] doubting myself because of how this is
[00:34:43] written I swear to God I was like maybe
[00:34:45] they were uncomfortable like maybe
[00:34:46] something happened I reached out again
[00:34:47] today and they were like um like I
[00:34:50] reached out they're like wait what do
[00:34:51] you mean there's rumors question I don't
[00:34:52] want to like say everything they said
[00:34:54] cuz I want to try to keep things private
[00:34:56] and not leak DMs like everyone keeps
[00:34:57] doing
[00:34:58] but they were like no like I was like I
[00:34:59] want to make sure we're cool and they're
[00:35:01] like oh yeah like I I just thought like
[00:35:04] I just felt bad because I felt like I
[00:35:05] ruin stuff or like whatever H and I was
[00:35:07] like no absolutely not it wasn't your
[00:35:08] fault I feel bad I'm sorry and they were
[00:35:10] like no we're cool again this was solved
[00:35:13] two years ago privately and there were
[00:35:15] rumors spread by a says it was bra I
[00:35:18] don't know who it was I don't care who
[00:35:19] it was I'm not blaming people there were
[00:35:21] rumors spread now it's public like is
[00:35:23] this worth writing it like I get you
[00:35:25] emotional and I'm not trying to blame
[00:35:26] you genuinely I get you've been through
[00:35:28] a lot but why would you word this like
[00:35:30] it's like assault like I really don't
[00:35:32] get it like it's like do you
[00:35:35] want like rumors are being spread about
[00:35:37] you and I feel bad about it and now it's
[00:35:40] like it's just
[00:35:42] weird now I talk to Brax about what the
[00:35:44] rumors were because the rumors are a bit
[00:35:46] different than this okay this isn't just
[00:35:48] don't like it's not just o or anything I
[00:35:49] asked what the rumors were and he was
[00:35:51] like oh well I wasn't there and we're on
[00:35:53] the same page man bra we sell that
[00:35:54] privately you don't have to like be
[00:35:56] weird about it but ly what the rumor was
[00:35:58] was it's also I checked also in the
[00:36:01] Stream multiple times said uh made girls
[00:36:03] feel uncomfortable it was one person and
[00:36:05] they didn't feel uncomfortable it was
[00:36:06] that one it was literally one person it
[00:36:08] was one and I apologized like 18 times
[00:36:10] and they didn't feel uncomfort I
[00:36:11] literally checked today again solv two
[00:36:13] years ago I checked today again they
[00:36:14] didn't feel uncomfortable they just felt
[00:36:16] bad because the party was kind of ruined
[00:36:18] and I take blame for that like I'm I'm
[00:36:20] sorry about that I genuinely am but it I
[00:36:22] don't like when they say oh plural like
[00:36:24] as if I I'm like weird and making people
[00:36:26] feel weird because if that happens I
[00:36:28] would like to know and I would like to
[00:36:29] do better and I do think regardless I
[00:36:31] have gotten better that's why he said I
[00:36:33] feel like you've matured a lot over the
[00:36:34] past few years because I have
[00:36:34] self-reflected a lot I do feel bad but
[00:36:37] it's not like it's made multiple like
[00:36:40] women feel that's not that okay so I
[00:36:43] talked to Brax about what uh like the
[00:36:45] rumors were just to you know like what
[00:36:46] he heard or whatever um I don't know who
[00:36:49] is reading it I quite frankly don't care
[00:36:51] but I care about what it is and if it's
[00:36:53] real if it's important if it's not just
[00:36:55] important but like if it's real if it's
[00:36:56] true I would like to address it I'd like
[00:36:58] to make it right if it's serious this
[00:37:00] ideally privately if it has to be public
[00:37:02] sure but ideally I could just resolve
[00:37:04] this privately uh this what it was is
[00:37:07] it's the same thing I told you guys but
[00:37:09] allegedly oh well I wasn't there but I
[00:37:11] know I heard from someone who may have
[00:37:13] been there I don't know I wasn't there
[00:37:14] maybe uh people felt people felt
[00:37:18] pressured to drink now here's what I'm
[00:37:20] going to say again I invited one person
[00:37:23] and it was the main person I was like
[00:37:25] talking to like it was a big group it's
[00:37:26] not like it was just me and them it was
[00:37:28] literally a big group and this is why I
[00:37:31] want to word myself
[00:37:32] carefully I like never again they what
[00:37:35] they felt bad about was maybe they
[00:37:36] ruined the party and I checked in on
[00:37:38] them again to make sure it wasn't like
[00:37:40] oh I didn't want to like the drink it
[00:37:42] was literally just I felt bad for
[00:37:43] ruining the party and it wasn't their
[00:37:44] fault at all like I don't blame them in
[00:37:45] fact I blame myself but it's not like I
[00:37:48] invited someone with the intention of
[00:37:49] like making them like get drunk or
[00:37:50] anything and that didn't even to my
[00:37:52] knowledge didn't happen they just left
[00:37:53] within it was like maybe 2 hours after
[00:37:55] and like that's it it was just over and
[00:37:57] like okay it kind of sucked but like
[00:37:59] like I feel bad it kind of sucked but
[00:38:00] it's not like it was oh well this guy
[00:38:03] pressures people to drink and because I
[00:38:05] heard the rumor I've been
[00:38:07] like reflecting a lot and in this
[00:38:10] instance it was literally just that's
[00:38:11] why I again I reached out today I was
[00:38:13] like I just want to make sure like we're
[00:38:16] cool like I didn't just say we're cool
[00:38:17] I'm like are you okay like you didn't
[00:38:18] just say you're okay just to like kind
[00:38:20] of move on like I want to make sure
[00:38:22] you're actually okay they're okay I
[00:38:24] don't want to name them like
[00:38:26] everything's cool we're cool we're
[00:38:28] friends if the one person involved is
[00:38:30] cool the one person that it matters
[00:38:32] about why is it public why are rumors
[00:38:34] being spread why is it like a big issue
[00:38:37] why is it worded like in a way that's
[00:38:38] like you read this and like you're
[00:38:41] like you're like if you've experience
[00:38:43] something bad you're like oh [ __ ] like
[00:38:45] this is something on that level it's
[00:38:47] like no the [ __ ] it
[00:38:48] isn't and even when I talk to people
[00:38:51] they're like oh well I heard this so I
[00:38:52] can't really take sides I don't know
[00:38:54] what's true I'm like [ __ ] I was
[00:38:55] there like I was there and I have
[00:38:56] friends who were there like
[00:38:58] I was there you weren't there like what
[00:38:59] are you H well maybe the person the
[00:39:04] person I
[00:39:05] invited check
[00:39:11] DM the person I invited like I really
[00:39:14] feel felt bad for them and I really
[00:39:16] think they're a good person and I think
[00:39:17] we're friends two years ago we solved
[00:39:20] this and we've talked since and today I
[00:39:23] reached out to them again just because I
[00:39:25] felt bad and they're they're
[00:39:30] fine
[00:39:31] anyways
[00:39:33] um and bra said this is not true I know
[00:39:36] in his first document he was like oh
[00:39:37] everyone's been told to shut the [ __ ] up
[00:39:39] about it which I I just assumed that
[00:39:41] wasn't about me and then that's why like
[00:39:42] at this when I was with ALU he was like
[00:39:45] well maybe what bra said was about you I
[00:39:46] was like how like what the [ __ ] so he
[00:39:49] like again I'm not blaming people
[00:39:51] probably a misunderstanding bra heard
[00:39:53] something auu heard something I'm not
[00:39:54] here to blame people I'm just saying the
[00:39:57] way was worded the way it's public for
[00:39:58] no reason the way it's not brought to me
[00:40:00] the way it's like a middleman telling me
[00:40:02] the way it's like [ __ ] this that I
[00:40:04] just think is weird and it's uh all it's
[00:40:06] not a non-issue I don't to like dismiss
[00:40:08] it like I think I could have done better
[00:40:09] it's just word it in a way that's like a
[00:40:10] huge [ __ ] deal when it's just okay
[00:40:14] like the night was kind of cringe like
[00:40:16] it it sucks the person involved was okay
[00:40:18] everything's fine that's that's what
[00:40:20] happened and I literally was like ready
[00:40:22] to talk about this and then a stream
[00:40:24] then kind of mentioned it too so like
[00:40:25] okay it lines up with what I'm [ __ ]
[00:40:26] saying except he was like oh well maybe
[00:40:28] it was like oh girls
[00:40:30] plural also I like I don't know I wasn't
[00:40:33] there but like he wasn't in the room but
[00:40:35] I'm pretty sure was in the same [ __ ]
[00:40:36] house like I'm not again my memory is
[00:40:38] [ __ ] terrible ask any of my friends
[00:40:40] like I'm pretty sure I went up and asked
[00:40:41] them like yo I can invite this person
[00:40:43] back right I was like yeah if not
[00:40:45] someone else asked whatever I mean I
[00:40:46] digress this is not important the last
[00:40:48] things I want to say are um the last
[00:40:50] things I want to say are for this you
[00:40:54] repeatedly emphasize how you would never
[00:40:55] side with me publicly regarding drama
[00:40:58] um this was just I do want to take a bit
[00:41:01] of accountability for this I don't think
[00:41:03] I should have said it to his face like
[00:41:04] that I think it's true and I still
[00:41:06] believe that unless you're like
[00:41:08] literally someone who's been who's had
[00:41:10] my back my whole life and who I really
[00:41:12] trust I don't really know you like that
[00:41:14] and with Austin in particular again I
[00:41:17] don't want this to be like misconstrued
[00:41:18] as like oh everyone I [ __ ] hate a I'm
[00:41:21] friends with him I was friends with him
[00:41:23] now I don't know I was friends with him
[00:41:25] maybe I still am and
[00:41:27] but I was never in like the like close
[00:41:30] friend group I'm not in like their group
[00:41:31] chats I'm not in like the close circles
[00:41:33] and I've heard like I'm not going to
[00:41:35] make this public because as [ __ ]
[00:41:37] mature adults we I like to solve this
[00:41:39] [ __ ] privately but like I've heard that
[00:41:42] he said some things or done some not
[00:41:43] done not done I don't want to make it
[00:41:45] amp up but said some things about me
[00:41:46] that I don't appreciate or about people
[00:41:48] that I care about and it it's it's made
[00:41:50] it to where I'm not fully trusting of
[00:41:52] anyone and so I'm not going to blindly
[00:41:55] be like Oh I'm your white knight in this
[00:41:56] drama let let me take the [ __ ] blow
[00:41:58] for you no man it's your [ __ ] C it's
[00:42:00] not my circus not my monkeys why would I
[00:42:02] [ __ ] jump in there and he didn't
[00:42:04] expect me to so I'm not like blaming
[00:42:06] it's not like he said you have to he
[00:42:07] didn't say that let me clarify he didn't
[00:42:09] say that but now he's saying like oh you
[00:42:11] emphasize how you never want to side and
[00:42:13] I shouldn't have said it so bluntly I
[00:42:14] admit and even I apologized to him I
[00:42:16] remember cuz after I said it Fang was
[00:42:18] like that was kind of an [ __ ] thing
[00:42:19] to do I was like I'm sorry yeah you're
[00:42:21] right it was I was just emotional
[00:42:22] because I was like it was at a point
[00:42:24] where I was like well what if something
[00:42:25] blows up or like you know like what if
[00:42:28] exactly this happens where it's like
[00:42:30] well I'm just manifesting against
[00:42:31] everyone it's like I don't want to have
[00:42:33] if there's another War I don't want to
[00:42:34] have to be like and I said like I would
[00:42:37] def like in my chat if you were
[00:42:38] slandering you would say no like stop
[00:42:39] being so mean and when we were watch
[00:42:41] partying the episode that we recorded on
[00:42:43] Jake's channel of like bra U ant Jake
[00:42:46] and me people are like how are bra and U
[00:42:48] in the same room I said to my chat it's
[00:42:50] in the VOD yo guys people are adults
[00:42:53] they can just talk things out it wasn't
[00:42:54] awkward and I didn't find the thing to
[00:42:56] be awkward like I had a time and it was
[00:42:59] cool but it's not like I'm going to like
[00:43:01] write a [ __ ] Google doc because like
[00:43:03] that's not me unless it's like about me
[00:43:05] or it's really serious I will but like
[00:43:07] that's not I'm not going to be like no
[00:43:09] guys especially when I had personal like
[00:43:12] I found considered you a
[00:43:16] friend I consider you a friend and I
[00:43:18] still do but I there are definitely some
[00:43:20] things
[00:43:21] that I heard that bothered me and we
[00:43:24] weren't as close as you were to some
[00:43:25] other people and that's okay and you
[00:43:26] didn't expect me to say anything that's
[00:43:28] just why I felt that way and when I
[00:43:29] heard like the dirt on you it bothered
[00:43:31] me and made me ask a bunch of questions
[00:43:33] which I get it you didn't want to be the
[00:43:35] middleman or whatever and that's fair
[00:43:37] and I probably should have just I don't
[00:43:39] know man it's just want I hear [ __ ] like
[00:43:40] that it it like [ __ ] with me and I want
[00:43:41] to know about it I don't want to feel
[00:43:43] guilty when like if there's something
[00:43:45] bad I want to resolve it or or apolog
[00:43:47] like do something about it and if it's
[00:43:49] just [ __ ] then I don't want to worry
[00:43:50] about it but if it's just like kind of
[00:43:52] ambiguous and it [ __ ] with
[00:43:54] me anyways I'm sorry for getting heated
[00:43:57] um I don't want to send harassment or
[00:43:59] hate to anyone everyone's fine actually
[00:44:01] I think everyone sucks like [ __ ]
[00:44:03] everyone I don't care
[00:44:06] um
[00:44:08] but
[00:44:12] like I genuinely this is important I
[00:44:15] genuinely do think that assu is in a
[00:44:17] really rough spot and has ridden this
[00:44:19] from an
[00:44:20] emotional standpoint that's very
[00:44:22] difficult for him I don't think he means
[00:44:23] it to be as dramatic as he made it out
[00:44:25] to be and I don't blame him for it I I
[00:44:28] blame many people for the rumors and for
[00:44:30] this being public even though it was
[00:44:32] solved privately two years ago reminder
[00:44:33] two years ago this wasn't yesterday this
[00:44:35] was two years ago and it was solved
[00:44:37] privately the day
[00:44:39] of however I do feel bad for him a lot
[00:44:42] of [ __ ] happened and I know that when
[00:44:44] you're in a dark spot you're not
[00:44:46] thinking rationally so I don't want
[00:44:47] people to dog pile him because that
[00:44:49] could you know be a bad thing okay I
[00:44:52] grew up with
[00:44:53] [ __ ] ah I shouldn't bring this up but
[00:44:55] like I I've seen drama Farmers like
[00:44:58] [ __ ] keemstar and then we know what
[00:44:59] happened to eeka like I don't want this
[00:45:01] [ __ ] I'm not trying to like make
[00:45:03] someone's life worse okay I I have no
[00:45:06] problem I just don't want things like
[00:45:08] this to be said especially in a word
[00:45:10] like this okay I just want to make that
[00:45:12] clear um I'm going to move on I'm not
[00:45:15] here to like milk drama I I know it's
[00:45:17] good for views and [ __ ] I'm not trying
[00:45:18] to make a video out of this I'm sure 18
[00:45:20] YouTubers will who who what happened
[00:45:22] explained like like okay but like that's
[00:45:26] all um um if there's anything that
[00:45:28] people want to talk about or you heard a
[00:45:30] rumor like I don't even know why I'm
[00:45:32] still talking like like if you want to
[00:45:33] reach out to me you can reach out to me
[00:45:34] that's all I'm trying to say but like
[00:45:35] this is what I just explained and that's
[00:45:40] it
[00:45:44] um
[00:45:48] yeah you pinned a chat from someone
[00:45:49] called G sfw now he pinned it he's a
[00:45:52] mod that's my uh he's a he's a OG mod
[00:45:55] he's actually a goat I like that
[00:45:58] guy look at dish sweet I really don't
[00:46:01] need to though like I don't know what it
[00:46:02] is but like and I like dish but like I I
[00:46:04] I kind of don't care like nothing
[00:46:07] against again I like dish but it's like
[00:46:09] do I really care about like what this
[00:46:10] person said this and this person said
[00:46:12] this like I I don't man this is high
[00:46:14] schooler
[00:46:18] [ __ ] like seriously like it's like but
[00:46:21] instead of it being like like I've had
[00:46:23] streamer friends DM me like yo are you
[00:46:24] okay is everything okay like I
[00:46:25] appreciate that but I'm not not like I'm
[00:46:28] not talking about what they said to me
[00:46:29] publicly or like we can talk about stuff
[00:46:33] and that's okay and it's also not about
[00:46:35] me like most of this it's 32 34 pages
[00:46:38] and like again I feel bad for U and I
[00:46:40] think he's going through a lot of tough
[00:46:41] things and I think there are rumors
[00:46:43] about him that aren't true and I think
[00:46:44] like some stuff like there's a lot of
[00:46:46] things that are [ __ ] but like as far
[00:46:48] as I'm concerned unless I want to milk a
[00:46:51] two-hour video on this what I should be
[00:46:54] concerned about is my part and my part
[00:46:56] is uh
[00:46:57] I don't want to dismiss it but it's
[00:46:59] being amped up to be much more than it
[00:47:01] really is and I'm going to leave it at
[00:47:02] that and I reached out to the person two
[00:47:04] years ago they're okay we're cool and I
[00:47:05] reached out to them again today to make
[00:47:07] sure just to make sure and they were
[00:47:10] cool and yes don't uh [ __ ] idolized
[00:47:13] content creators this could be anyone
[00:47:14] this could even be me I I saw people
[00:47:16] like I appreciate you guys but I saw
[00:47:17] people being like no like no way off at
[00:47:18] anything and like I appreciate that cuz
[00:47:21] I know I didn't but I don't want you to
[00:47:23] like blindly like put your faith in
[00:47:25] someone but it's also I feel like when
[00:47:27] you're a morally responsible person that
[00:47:28] says that I feel like the other people
[00:47:29] that aren't morally responsible like oh
[00:47:31] no I always believe me and then it's
[00:47:32] like they have more like fans because
[00:47:33] they're like doesn't matter you don't
[00:47:35] always believe your [ __ ] favorite
[00:47:36] person that you don't know okay thank
[00:47:37] you anyways

[01:21:06] circl it's fine wait was this attack
[01:21:08] clet
[01:21:10] skeleton okay if you're like Jade Spear
[01:21:12] and you're using attack sure but on a
[01:21:14] [ __ ] Scarlet Sands please get an em
[01:21:16] Sands I am begging
[01:21:20] you also you have zero er do you have
[01:21:22] constellations no yeah you probably want
[01:21:24] some Er
[01:21:25] like not bad overall but yeah I would I
[01:21:28] would try to get some some your sh's
[01:21:30] good though your sh's good
[01:21:34] though wait so why doesn't Echo work I
[01:21:37] never
[01:21:38] understood Echo is like okay let's say
[01:21:41] you ever get like a buy one get one or
[01:21:43] like okay you ever like okay you ever
[01:21:46] see like okay you ever see like a oh buy
[01:21:48] five cant get the sixth one free and
[01:21:50] you're like dude I just want like four
[01:21:52] and then you end up being like [ __ ] it
[01:21:53] I'll get five so I can get the six one
[01:21:55] and then what happens what happens what
[01:21:56] happens yes I'll rate your sub your sh
[01:21:59] for Subs but it has to be a worthy price
[01:22:01] and then what happens is you only eat
[01:22:02] like four croissants and then you end up
[01:22:04] throwing two but you got them cuz like
[01:22:05] they were free it was good value but
[01:22:06] like you ended up throwing them or not
[01:22:07] eating them or they got stale so you
[01:22:09] kind of regret it that's kind of like
[01:22:11] Echo like it comes with Vermillion but
[01:22:13] you don't want it cuz it sucks on most
[01:22:14] characters also on high ping the proing
[01:22:17] is uh inconsistent so it's
[01:22:20] worse you could use it on Clarin though
[01:22:22] so maybe it's optimal
[01:22:36] no no Z no no get away get away no no no
[01:22:41] don't do it don't do

[01:55:23] [Music]
[01:55:32] I really don't think z f engag in sub
[01:55:34] tweeting bro I just talked about it
[01:55:35] right now your like two minutes I
[01:55:38] literally tweeted then went live that
[01:55:39] was my way of saying I'm going live also
[01:55:42] I I get this I I do personally believe
[01:55:45] that all this like sub tweeting he said
[01:55:47] she said let's make rumors public is
[01:55:49] [ __ ] I fully agree however if some
[01:55:52] someone's going to paint
[01:55:54] something to be like I don't want to say
[01:55:56] it's like minor per se but something a
[01:55:58] lot smaller like something to make
[01:56:00] something seem really big when it's not
[01:56:02] that big of a
[01:56:03] thing I think that is a little bit of
[01:56:06] clown behavior and I think I can engage
[01:56:08] with that in an unserious way because
[01:56:10] it's not serious like you're [ __ ]
[01:56:12] like bro like you have your [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:56:14] and balls out what are you

[01:57:21] a filter today but
[01:57:26] I was I was talking about like Star rail
[01:57:28] characters I liked with like the people
[01:57:30] at this thing I'm not going to say who
[01:57:31] was there well I mean you guys kind of
[01:57:32] saw like it was like yeah there's a
[01:57:35] bunch of people and like I was like oh I
[01:57:36] like these characters I was like and
[01:57:37] then I said I like sparkle but not like
[01:57:40] the racist part like not because she's
[01:57:42] and then they were like oh so you like
[01:57:43] the racism I was like No And then it
[01:57:45] became a thing I was like can we please
[01:57:46] kill this narrative right now and they
[01:57:48] kept saying it it's not because of that
[01:57:51] okay but I think she's cool doal while I
[01:57:55] run errands okay this
[01:57:58] doesn't this okay to list of How likely
[01:58:02] character will be able to see arinara
[01:58:05] rational
[01:58:12] okay
[01:58:15] okay
[01:58:17] okay this has a hundred replies I don't
[01:58:20] even want to click this
[01:58:25] I'm curious [ __ ]
[01:58:35] it re Reddit is like this is why I'm not
[01:58:39] Reddit is like so it is it
[01:58:42] is Z's birthday cake why did you print
[01:58:45] this when did I wear a tie what the
[01:58:49] [ __ ] it's great to stay in the door
[01:58:52] domain until you can get a four piece em
[01:58:54] set or or two out of your three Sands
[01:58:57] goblet and hat and the for for your cie
[01:59:00] or for your Ryden or for your Neu Hydro
[01:59:02] characters or whatever but this is a lot
[01:59:04] easier than getting perfect min max crit
[01:59:06] stats and I know it can be challenging
[01:59:08] to get em main stats but the reality is
[01:59:11] you only need the EM main stat it's a
[01:59:13] lot easier than getting double crit
[01:59:14] Elemental damage yeah true that's just
[01:59:16] the reality true I actually made my own
[01:59:18] TS we didn't upload it though [ __ ] wait
[01:59:19] I didn't upload it it's literally
[01:59:21] unlisted on my second Channel I'm sorry
[01:59:22] Mariah if you're watching
[01:59:25] this um oh these are individual sets
[01:59:28] though I did domain tier list is
[01:59:29] different do I agree with
[01:59:34] this I would probably put emblem higher
[01:59:36] but and viridescent but I agree with
[01:59:39] most of it we believe that the
[01:59:41] underwater proportion inant what ain't
[01:59:44] no way a guy from socks chat was
[01:59:46] secretly an uncle 200 resin cap no
[01:59:50] weighing okay
[02:00:01] okay A lot of people are convinced that
[02:00:04] for what is this please don't be a St
[02:00:07] lock please don't be a works amazingly
[02:00:09] in dander based teams so let me tell you
[02:00:11] why it's not the case first of all for's
[02:00:15] like the damage bonus doesn't affect
[02:00:17] transformative reactions like Bloom and
[02:00:18] Hyper Bloom okay but it bumps you around
[02:00:20] iation is way worse than for example C
[02:00:24] therefore you will generate signicantly
[02:00:26] less Bloom oh cool but do you know what
[02:00:28] you generate more of spreads which means
[02:00:30] more uh sorry quickens which means more
[02:00:31] spreads and uh aggravates so it can
[02:00:34] actually be better to have less Hydro
[02:00:35] that's why I use Theon over syro a lot
[02:00:36] of times without hym although both are
[02:00:38] viable course second forina doesn't buff
[02:00:41] transformative reaction I knew it I
[02:00:42] [ __ ] knew yo pre-at I [ __ ] knew it
[02:00:44] hyper and bar damage won't change and
[02:00:46] lastly she forces you to play baaja or
[02:00:48] even worse Yao ya instead of stronger
[02:00:50] Nita which causes further loss of damage
[02:00:52] that being said forina is still strong
[02:00:54] enough to mify those downsides but DPS
[02:00:56] increase she brings in those teams is
[02:00:58] not very big a lot of people are
[02:01:10] convinc I disagree the last part is fine
[02:01:14] like it's not like the biggest increase
[02:01:15] in damage sure it isn't it's not the
[02:01:17] biggest but like
[02:01:23] I don't
[02:01:25] know I think that's a I think this is a
[02:01:27] bad short sorry if you made this and
[02:01:29] you're watching you're like I thought it
[02:01:30] was a good short that's cool uh 570 high
[02:01:34] score you are brain rotted 1618 you are

[02:27:38] cry although usually it's official not
[02:27:41] cookie oh it was
[02:27:42] official wait I need a team for this
[02:27:44] domain honestly you could overload the
[02:27:46] shields right we can try overload but I
[02:27:49] feel like J Le is no we're going to play
[02:27:51] Jong Lee we're going to do uh our Queen

[02:29:15] if you own

[02:29:26] because these
[02:29:28] weapons are kind of terrible it gives
[02:29:30] you crit rate when you don't crit but
[02:29:32] you typically want to crit cuz you're

[03:58:19] um I'll bite just cuz I like Jake he's
[03:58:23] at least to towards me he's the homie
[03:58:26] so I wanted to make a statement about
[03:58:28] ATU
[03:58:30] myself I'm someone who's very
[03:58:34] non and very avoidant I think that's the
[03:58:37] white unit Shir out the same one anyways
[03:58:38] I'll shut up sorry let me
[03:58:42] restart I'm so is very
[03:58:46] non-confrontational and very avoidant
[03:58:49] when it comes to talking about these
[03:58:50] sorts of things and it's because I
[03:58:53] always thought it was sustainable for me
[03:58:54] to do this for myself to live and
[03:58:57] survive
[03:59:01] um but because of it
[03:59:05] sorry I was unable to be there for ATU
[03:59:09] when he needed it he says he still sees
[03:59:12] me as his friend
[03:59:14] and I told him that I still do
[03:59:17] too and I believe that we will grow and
[03:59:20] overcome it together um but of course
[03:59:24] it'll take time there's a lot
[03:59:27] of there's a lot to this whole situation
[03:59:30] there's many wrongs on both sides uh but
[03:59:36] for me I am very scared when it comes to
[03:59:40] these sorts of things because I don't
[03:59:41] like talking about it of
[03:59:47] about conflicts it's because I'm afraid
[03:59:51] of what will happen because I don't know
[03:59:53] what will
[03:59:54] happen and I'm afraid I might
[03:59:56] lose everything here that helps me live
[04:00:02] and also support my family at
[04:00:04] home but it's gotten to a point where I
[04:00:07] I I want to say things to to stand for
[04:00:12] myself and for others
[04:00:15] and so I'm saying this now to hold
[04:00:17] myself accountable and to grow from it
[04:00:20] and be a better person regarding bra I
[04:00:24] was mad at him for a while because he
[04:00:25] did dox my girlfriend's face and I was
[04:00:28] not happy about that he did apologize
[04:00:30] and I was still mad and I should have
[04:00:34] communicated that better to him that I
[04:00:36] was upset okay I've heard enough this is
[04:00:38] high schooler drama sorry sorry for
[04:00:40] making you watch that I mean no respect
