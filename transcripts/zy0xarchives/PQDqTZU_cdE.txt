[00:31:02] unlucky
[00:31:03] [ __ ] I thought I thought leaving an
[00:31:06] empty slot would put fra here I got
[00:31:13] [ __ ] that's not the right character
[00:31:17] but oh maybe we play our French playlist
[00:31:19] today
[00:31:25] actually dude she's
[00:31:30] I don't think
[00:31:33] she's I have a high she like how do I
[00:31:36] how do I describe fre I think she lives
[00:31:38] life on caps lock
[00:31:41] like yeah she lives in caps
[00:31:46] lock I respect it though I says you what
[00:31:49] do you mean says
[00:31:52] [Music]
[00:31:55] me dude wolfang actually matches her
[00:31:57] really well but we're using festering
[00:31:59] imagine not having fering hey chat point
[00:32:02] at laugh no
[00:32:05] fering
[00:32:10] sorry
[00:32:18] sorry FS R man is their weapon better
[00:32:21] festing yes but not by like that
[00:32:24] much it's like 10 to 15% R3 ring still
[00:32:27] better than um okay apparently zff so
[00:32:31] zff in the weapon rank in the so there's
[00:32:33] a Freo weapon rank in my video it'll be
[00:32:34] out tonight in or or within 24 hours in
[00:32:38] the weapon ranking zff put an R3
[00:32:40] festering cuz so many people ask about
[00:32:42] it so apparently there's a lot of people
[00:32:44] that did the event but didn't refine it
[00:32:45] for some reason so if that's you we got
[00:32:48] you
[00:32:50] covered I don't know how that's possible
[00:32:53] but actually that's not true my ALT
[00:32:55] account has an R2
[00:32:57] uh I gave my good I gave my finina
[00:32:59] pieces to
[00:33:05] Candace oh I rolled this off stream it's
[00:33:07] not the best but it had three sub stats
[00:33:09] I rolled it got crit rate I rolled it
[00:33:10] got 10 that's not bad with ER it's
[00:33:12] actually okay it's not amazing it's okay
[00:33:14] though it's okay for
[00:33:16] now HP goblet question mark HP goblet is
[00:33:19] about as good as Hydro it's slightly
[00:33:21] better but not like I heard other people
[00:33:24] explain it like Hydro like HP is way
[00:33:26] better and it confused me and then I
[00:33:28] looked into it and it's literally like
[00:33:29] one substat so if people say that
[00:33:31] they're stupid and dumb but it's like
[00:33:32] it's basically the same HP and hydro are
[00:33:34] both good HP is lowkey a bit better
[00:33:36] though if you're typing copium you're
[00:33:37] wrong cuz golden troop gives you so much
[00:33:39] damage percent and then her burst gives
[00:33:40] you so much damage percent that HP ends
[00:33:41] up being a bit better but it's like
[00:33:43] about as
[00:33:50] good also we gain crit when we Ascend
[00:33:52] her but for now juicy what do you
[00:33:55] recommend for having no fering is Wolf
[00:33:57] Fang good what do you recommend if
[00:33:59] having no festering oh uh if you have no
[00:34:03] fering no
[00:34:05] fering sorry uh you can fish for f sound
[00:34:11] Fairman Lake light lily oh
[00:34:20] [ __ ]
[00:34:24] well her noral attack looks really cool
[00:34:27] look at this also chat look at
[00:34:31] this and if you have summoned creatures
[00:34:33] they swap so this is like what you
[00:34:34] normally want but let's say you do this
[00:34:36] boom it's a Healer
[00:34:40] boom normally you're in this phase
[00:34:42] though if you're in the other phase
[00:34:43] you're kind of griefing but it's cool
[00:34:44] for like exploring cuz you get a
[00:34:47] Healer disgusting weapon pull the
[00:34:49] signature
[00:34:50] why the signature is
[00:34:53] significantly worse when compared to
[00:34:55] other signatures compared to the free to
[00:34:57] plays and this signature compared to
[00:34:58] this free to play if you need ER and
[00:34:59] usually you need ER and my artifacts
[00:35:01] need ER so it's only like 10% better for
[00:35:03] me 10% is not worth $200 but it does
[00:35:07] look pretty and okay ZF got mad at me
[00:35:10] for saying this but I'm debating pulling
[00:35:12] it for AO cuz my IO is lowkey like rank
[00:35:15] one with Miss spitter and I need a crit
[00:35:17] damage
[00:35:17] weapon I have low five that's not a high
[00:35:20] them I don't
[00:35:25] know do I have to do the world quest to
[00:35:28] get to the new area chat or do I just
[00:35:30] [ __ ] walk does anyone know cuz I need
[00:35:32] to get flowers I could also join
[00:35:34] people's
[00:35:34] worlds I hate when a new character needs
[00:35:37] an entire new region of mats it's going
[00:35:38] to take forever walk
[00:35:47] okay can you change her
[00:35:49] skin yeah see now she's white like blue
[00:35:53] and white instead of blue and blue now
[00:35:55] it's dark
[00:36:02] Zago zap donated $1 being playing since
[00:36:05] 1.0 and every time you mention my one
[00:36:08] snowman piece and no festering him going
[00:36:11] to make you festering desire and new One
[00:36:14] D why do you have one snowman
[00:36:18] piece walk on water yes but kakomi could
[00:36:21] first
[00:36:22] so we we kokomi paved the way for finina
[00:36:26] true w why the [ __ ] is sa whatever it's
[00:36:28] fine say's actually fine with
[00:36:31] fin out benit changling why the [ __ ] are
[00:36:34] you playing Bennett triangl
[00:36:39] witho
[00:36:40] comfor how am I a comfort streamer if
[00:36:44] anything it's your favorite
[00:36:50] discomfort but these guys are cool look
[00:36:52] they literally like will fly up to your
[00:36:54] opponent it's pretty sick they also
[00:36:56] follow you
[00:37:05] around let the world Collide let the
[00:37:08] world
[00:37:10] Collide and then there's people that are
[00:37:12] going to appear right now boom watch
[00:37:13] this boom watch this boom watch yeah
[00:37:16] that means there people watching you
[00:37:17] whenever you see people in fina's burst
[00:37:18] pop up it means that people at hoyo are
[00:37:22] watching you play that's not true it's
[00:37:24] actually just fanf Faire Stacks does
[00:37:26] anyone know exactly the amount of Fan
[00:37:28] Fair Stacks they pop up at I think it's
[00:37:30] 100 200 300 cuz there's three but I'm
[00:37:32] not sure cuz it's weird to test and I
[00:37:34] didn't feel like counting all the
[00:37:36] healing I was gaining cuz I had a
[00:37:37] limited time uh only to make the video
[00:37:39] but it is it 100 200 300 cuz I know it
[00:37:42] pops up when it's maxed but anyways if
[00:37:45] you guys know let me
[00:37:48] know you said you show me the
[00:37:55] script
[00:37:58] uh fine I usually literally just record
[00:38:01] off the top of my head Carlo than about
[00:38:03] but I didn't want this section to be too
[00:38:04] long so I wrote like I was like I'll
[00:38:05] just write one or two points and end up
[00:38:07] writing a whole [ __ ]
[00:38:09] notepad so
[00:38:12] um tldr tldr she's like a better tldr
[00:38:18] she's balanced in a way where she's
[00:38:19] really [ __ ] strong but she doesn't
[00:38:21] power creep anyone cuz the other Hydro
[00:38:22] supports are sometimes better or
[00:38:24] sometimes worse which is really cool
[00:38:26] what the [ __ ] this I'm not reading sorry
[00:38:37] okay appreciate you uh Joelle her
[00:38:40] gameplay looks cool yes you'll see I
[00:38:42] mean I can't really show it yet but
[00:38:43] you'll see for the record okay for my
[00:38:47] team section by the way by the way by
[00:38:51] the way I literally have to cut in the
[00:38:53] middle to add more teams cuz there's too
[00:38:56] many look monoh Hydro Hut uh hyper blo
[00:39:00] Yia duuke Shia kaching nilu and there's
[00:39:05] nevet and there's way more there's I
[00:39:07] there's so
[00:39:09] many there's probably not a single
[00:39:11] character other than
[00:39:13] like yeah I mean I guess there's a few
[00:39:15] she doesn't really want to work with but
[00:39:16] for the most part she can be play with
[00:39:18] like
[00:39:21] anyone uh the Showcase of my video is
[00:39:23] going to have three a clip of three
[00:39:25] different teams there's a Hut there's a
[00:39:27] nevet and the last one I didn't choose
[00:39:28] either mono Hydro or aam I don't know
[00:39:30] yet I was thinking of doing a fourstar
[00:39:32] clear but I was like all the fourstar
[00:39:34] healers no the fourar heers are fine but
[00:39:36] a lot of the fourstar team comps with
[00:39:37] her are kind of weird cuz you usually
[00:39:38] build them around like one carry and
[00:39:40] it's like it's weird the four star
[00:39:41] carries kind of don't synergize
[00:39:44] as that's actually maybe a false
[00:39:46] statement let me
[00:39:47] think uh yeah I mean
[00:39:52] yeah Noel actually true Noel is good
[00:39:54] with her Noel unironically got like Noel
[00:40:00] unironically jumps up one to two tiers
[00:40:03] cuz she can full heal your entire
[00:40:14] team is finina better than Yellen and
[00:40:17] ziny shut the [ __ ] up shut up stop it's
[00:40:21] too early in the day for the is finina
[00:40:24] better than Singo shut stop
[00:40:26] stop stop it it's too early we just went
[00:40:30] live we just went live we just went
[00:40:34] live I can make it a clip actually uh
[00:40:38] should I make this a
[00:40:40] clip cuz I wrote I literally recorded
[00:40:43] for so long about this that I ended up
[00:40:45] like destroying it cuz I talked for too
[00:40:47] long so I deleted it and then
[00:40:48] re-recorded
[00:40:52] it
[00:40:55] okay
[00:40:58] okay I'm going to pause alerts everyone
[00:40:59] shut up everyone shut up I'm going to
[00:41:01] answer this once and only once and for
[00:41:03] anyone else we exclamation mark whatever
[00:41:06] command we make it
[00:41:08] okay okay let me record this on the Hut
[00:41:11] team okay listen here you're probably
[00:41:16] watching this because you asked if
[00:41:17] finina is better than Singo or yolan
[00:41:18] you're one of those Chatters okay no
[00:41:20] it's okay I still respect you here's the
[00:41:22] answer yes and no okay fina's buff and
[00:41:25] personal damage is so [ __ ] insane
[00:41:27] that anytime you can run her you run her
[00:41:29] however she needs a Healer that can full
[00:41:30] heal all of your team at the same time
[00:41:32] which means a lot of the times you have
[00:41:33] to remove a good offensive option like
[00:41:34] Kazo for a defensive one like Jean or
[00:41:36] Nikita for baiju for example it's still
[00:41:38] not bad but something you have to
[00:41:38] consider with that in mind if you can
[00:41:40] run foren team you usually want to and
[00:41:42] you can run double Hydro kind of like
[00:41:43] cro and yolan you can run yolan or cro
[00:41:45] and finina now how does she compare with
[00:41:46] others well her Hydro application is a
[00:41:48] bit slower so she doesn't really want to
[00:41:49] be the solo Hydro for someone like Hut
[00:41:50] duuk but she can for my testing for the
[00:41:53] most part keep up with someone like Yia
[00:41:54] or DEA barely right which is not not bad
[00:41:56] but I usually recommend using your
[00:41:57] double Hydro in teams like that and in
[00:41:59] situations like that Yan's personal like
[00:42:01] percentage motion value damage is higher
[00:42:03] than fina's but finina can actually have
[00:42:05] more personal damage because her buff
[00:42:07] Buffs all of your party including
[00:42:08] herself which means with her Buffs she
[00:42:10] can actually do more and yon's buff is
[00:42:12] only to the active character however
[00:42:14] snol gives you defensive utility and
[00:42:15] healing and faster hyd drop so does yon
[00:42:17] so there's situations where you want to
[00:42:18] use them more than free enough for
[00:42:19] example you only want one Hydro
[00:42:20] character or you need a Healer like you
[00:42:22] can't fit a Healer like Gene in your
[00:42:23] team and Kazo gives you grouping so do
[00:42:24] you want to replace Kazo with je you
[00:42:25] want to as soon as you don't so it's
[00:42:27] pretty nuan but for is well balanced but
[00:42:28] also broken like she's pretty op but she
[00:42:31] doesn't power creep anyone true okay did
[00:42:33] that fit in a minute maybe there you
[00:42:37] go what about Amber on aita it is not
[00:42:40] enough play Prototype Amber as your only
[00:42:41] healer you will die and I will laugh at
[00:42:43] you but protype Amber is good to
[00:42:46] supplement another healer so let's say
[00:42:48] you don't have Buu who's like really
[00:42:49] good at like healing your full team you
[00:42:51] could do like protype Amber Nita and
[00:42:53] then um like a single like kooky or
[00:42:56] something and it's like two mid healers
[00:42:58] can like make up for the good
[00:43:01] healer okay I'm my throat hurts let me
[00:43:03] drink
[00:43:12] water this team is pretty cracked well
[00:43:15] Flex last all you can play [ __ ] M
[00:43:17] here dude it doesn't
[00:43:18] matter m is actually decent with uh
[00:43:21] finina I kind of want to level finina I
[00:43:23] mean M why do I have no glider
[00:43:27] where the [ __ ] is the
[00:43:30] Oculus is it in the [ __ ]
[00:43:34] clam oh I got
[00:43:38] it can Fino use key yes let me pull up
[00:43:42] sorry let me pull up an interactive map
[00:43:43] to see where her flowers

[01:07:46] want to heal on
[01:07:52] her
[01:07:55] Sheil Loki the worst archon okay that is
[01:07:57] bait that is this guy pulled for farita
[01:08:00] played her played her level two and then
[01:08:04] concluded she's at least top two she's
[01:08:07] like I think she's I honestly don't
[01:08:12] think that she's like yeah I think she's
[01:08:15] top
[01:08:17] two like I think Nita I mean Nita's
[01:08:19] [ __ ] Nita's broken but I think Fin's
[01:08:21] also
[01:08:22] broken
[01:08:35] he is a lot more Universal I mean okay
[01:08:37] finina is universal but the thing is you
[01:08:39] might already have SRO yolan net child
[01:08:42] ayat like you might have 50 Hydro
[01:08:44] characters on your account in which case
[01:08:46] Fino is still good but it's like okay
[01:08:48] you can modify your
[01:08:49] teams but like the less Hydro characters
[01:08:52] you have
[01:08:55] the more each Hydro five star becomes
[01:09:07] valuable uh who should I play
[01:09:10] today wait let me play R Shia actually
[01:09:13] where's the Shia
[01:09:19] team sure I'll hang out with you
[01:09:22] youngsters
[01:09:25] wait is this boss hydro hydro
[01:09:28] boss it's
[01:09:34] fine what talent first
[01:09:39] for what you ask talents just EQ or q e
[01:09:42] but both are
[01:09:48] important
[01:09:52] conquering
[01:09:58] oh
[01:10:00] dude the
[01:10:04] world the [ __ ] is this we'll see okay my
[01:10:07] friend is level six okay don't don't get
[01:10:09] mad at her
[01:10:12] dying Dodge
[01:10:16] Dodge
[01:10:19] whene
[01:10:22] lat
[01:10:26] what the
[01:10:27] [ __ ] he just he just threw a javelet at
[01:10:32] me IM the one time in middle school this
[01:10:34] kid threw a chair at me True by the way
[01:10:36] true story I dodged it though that's why
[01:10:39] I play Shia cuz I can
[01:10:46] dodge anyways whoa L
[01:10:51] Blossom did you ey frame the
[01:10:54] chair oh we only got two water that
[01:10:57] failed to transcend oh
[01:11:01] sad
[01:11:14] s also scar remains Rejoice because this
[01:11:19] team but with scar instead of Jiao and
[01:11:23] like Michael instead of Jean or like
[01:11:26] maybe Charlotte I'm not sure if she's
[01:11:27] better but um something like this with
[01:11:30] Scara actually pretty good you can
[01:11:33] actually play pretty good uh there's
[01:11:34] pretty good Synergy with finina you you
[01:11:36] just don't have a lot of defensive
[01:11:37] utility cuz it's hard to run like a
[01:11:39] shield and a Healer cuz the two and ones
[01:11:41] are not as good not good enough unless
[01:11:43] it's BYU but BYU doesn't synergize too
[01:11:45] well cuz you can't like swirl
[01:11:49] dendro yeah who's Michael mik
[01:11:52] Mika
[01:12:02] soon so let see one heals are insane I
[01:12:04] need to test her a bit more I know she's
[01:12:06] good with finina cuz she can heal your
[01:12:07] full team um but outside of that I I
[01:12:11] need to play her more I Haven have
[01:12:17] time I also know charging her e takes
[01:12:20] [ __ ] six
[01:12:22] decades I need to go
[01:12:29] here does a weapon better worth it no
[01:12:32] but if you really want fre his weapon
[01:12:34] you can but it's not I don't recommend
[01:12:37] it let me
[01:12:52] navigate
[01:12:55] yeah wait actually that's a good take
[01:12:57] won't guys no no dude surely this isn't
[01:13:00] even Suk but surely NE finina is going
[01:13:03] to get a rerun in like [ __ ] five
[01:13:05] patches with nevet and then you can get
[01:13:07] Net's weapon and Fin's weapon on the
[01:13:09] same Banner like I surely that just
[01:13:19] happens already
[01:13:22] coping
[01:13:25] sorry where's
[01:13:34] Lenny yeah imagine she reruns with
[01:13:36] kokomi and then it's the [ __ ] other
[01:13:52] donut
[01:14:04] can she work with another dedicated
[01:14:06] healer are you assuming finina I mean
[01:14:09] are you asking if finina is a dedicated
[01:14:10] healer or are you assuming finina is a
[01:14:13] dedicated
[01:14:21] healer did I okay I thought it was going
[01:14:23] to
[01:14:24] drown dudee Fontana saved me like at
[01:14:27] least [ __ ] 20
[01:14:35] times okay I'm also going to say this
[01:14:37] once so the people in chat now know and
[01:14:39] don't have to ask okay okay
[01:14:43] finina doesn't heal she can heal but she
[01:14:46] shouldn't all you do on finina is you
[01:14:49] press Q sorry you press e you press Q
[01:14:53] you you swap that's it your e does a lot
[01:14:56] of damage by draining the [ __ ] of your
[01:14:57] whole team you drain the HP they do more
[01:14:59] damage then your burst Buffs everyone
[01:15:02] including herself based on how much come
[01:15:04] you drained and how much healing they
[01:15:06] gain whenever you lose HP buff whenever
[01:15:09] you gain HP buff that's all you need to
[01:15:12] know however you're draining all of your
[01:15:15] party members HP at the same time so you
[01:15:18] want a Healer that can heal everyone at
[01:15:21] the same time can you use Kookie Bennett
[01:15:23] whatever yes but it'll be worse cuz you
[01:15:25] have to swap through your characters and
[01:15:27] you might be like okay what if I just
[01:15:29] don't die okay well then you you do less
[01:15:31] damage cuz finina needs to
[01:15:33] drain I almost said come again she needs
[01:15:35] to drain your HP or her skill will do
[01:15:37] less damage 40% more if four characters
[01:15:40] are above 50%
[01:15:47] HP wait Hoover just confirmed raids are
[01:15:51] coming eight player raids I just
[01:15:54] confirmed it listen finina Elemental
[01:15:58] skill does more damage based on how many
[01:16:02] party members in your HP are above
[01:16:08] 50% how many part you have above 50% HP
[01:16:11] increase your damage okay if 1 2 three
[01:16:14] or four you gain 10% 20% 30% or 40% more
[01:16:17] damage but why after the One 2 three
[01:16:20] four characters they put or more why
[01:16:23] would they willingly put or more in
[01:16:26] fina's kit for the first time out of
[01:16:28] anyone's kit because we're getting raids
[01:16:33] true eight player raids are coming not
[01:16:35] copium trials trial
[01:16:39] characters okay maybe that's true but it
[01:16:41] would be cooler if it was because of
[01:16:42] raids you have to admit it would be
[01:16:44] cooler it would be cooler it would be
[01:16:52] cooler
[01:17:04] Hut yolan freom Moda protype Amber no
[01:17:06] you're going to die don't do that don't
[01:17:08] do that you are not healing
[01:17:16] enough if anything you'd play SRO over
[01:17:19] yolan like a thousand times it's
[01:17:21] actually not even close it's literally
[01:17:22] so not close that it's laughable it's
[01:17:24] actually so much better to ghosting CH
[01:17:27] for the healing there that I literally
[01:17:28] laugh at the idea of benching
[01:17:39] him anyways I need chat uh unfortunately
[01:17:43] we have to level fre now I mean I want
[01:17:45] to level her but unfortunately it takes
[01:17:46] [ __ ] 5 Years cuz it's new mats so I
[01:17:48] might need to yell people's flowers give
[01:17:50] me a minute uh but I assume most people
[01:17:52] going pull for fin if you want to pull
[01:17:54] for her or did or are going to don't

[01:35:51] be one side oh dude I I was playing slay
[01:35:56] the spy with Z Jeff and then like in the
[01:35:59] middle he was like yo drip marketing
[01:36:00] just came out and then I looked at it I
[01:36:02] wasn't streaming though so you guys
[01:36:03] didn't get my authentic reaction however
[01:36:07] however they are at this is not a drill
[01:36:09] they are adding America to gench and
[01:36:11] impact where is it they are adding
[01:36:13] America to genin impact hell yeah
[01:36:15] brother we're now getting guns they're
[01:36:18] adding America where is it where is she
[01:36:20] where is she
[01:36:22] with a gun this is like Shang Ling with
[01:36:24] a gun hell yeah
[01:36:28] brother or pom pom with a gun true
[01:36:30] American pom
[01:36:34] pom okay uh I am not allowing chusi to
[01:36:38] be in my chat that is a that is a
[01:36:40] 10-minute timeout such a hassle okay
[01:36:43] that is a time that is a 10-minute
[01:36:44] timeout so much but CH is there also
[01:36:48] Navia hi Navia she's awesome hopefully
[01:36:52] silver and the other the old dude what's
[01:36:54] the old dude's name silver easy and the
[01:36:56] old dude they pull up
[01:36:58] when net Navia is fighting Bo melis yeah
[01:37:02] Melo how do you say his name Meo melis
[01:37:06] whatever hopefully they pull
[01:37:09] up uh she will save Gio true not copium
[01:37:13] she will save
[01:37:20] Gio
[01:37:21] also uh an advantage of finina now that
[01:37:24] we're talking about Navia is that no sus
[01:37:29] at all whatsoever we no
[01:37:32] sus something that is important to know
[01:37:34] with finina is that SRO and yolan their
[01:37:38] rain sword rain dice water only fire off
[01:37:41] on normal attacks whereas a character
[01:37:43] like finina the hydro is apt all the
[01:37:46] time even if you're not you know
[01:37:47] attacking so just keep that in mind for
[01:37:49] someone like de
[01:37:51] or maybe future characters cuz we know
[01:37:54] font is a region that is is you know not
[01:37:56] traditional you do other stuff than just
[01:37:59] normal attack in
[01:38:05] Fontan oh
[01:38:07] also I'm going to have to make a Youtube
[01:38:09] short about how I [ __ ] okay one
[01:38:11] second one Zio Dan's Leaf did I not
[01:38:16] listen listen did I
[01:38:20] not
[01:38:22] I talked about this earlier
[01:38:26] but
[01:38:29] uh let it go I am not letting it go did
[01:38:34] I not [ __ ] predict Fin's entire kit
[01:38:38] no it's not veron's only good on one
[01:38:40] character no it's not no it's not this
[01:38:41] was before finina leaks by the way
[01:38:43] people like oh this was before anything
[01:38:47] okay riddle me this cie and Toma before
[01:38:50] D take damage in your burst the four
[01:38:51] piece also gives you a ton attack
[01:38:53] percent so when we get the new region of
[01:38:55] Conor and Dan Leaf's alt void prism
[01:38:59] damages you and gives you damage percent
[01:39:01] the Vermilion set will give you attack
[01:39:03] when you take this is literally what
[01:39:04] finina does by the way void prism is
[01:39:08] literally Conor and df's ALT void prism
[01:39:12] damages you and gives you damage percent
[01:39:15] the Vermilion set will give you attack
[01:39:16] when you take damage making Vermilion
[01:39:19] best in slot on every character
[01:39:21] especially those without their signature
[01:39:23] set so while we don't discuss leaks on
[01:39:25] this channel I think let's just call it
[01:39:26] a hunch I literally predicted for's kit
[01:39:30] now I can milk a short reacting to the
[01:39:31] short
[01:39:35] true TR look at the thumbnail isn't this
[01:39:37] pretty it's beautiful anyways yeah
[01:39:39] they're adding America so I'm
[01:39:44] excited we don't care okay well sorry
[01:39:47] I'm sorry for speaking I'll actually I I
[01:39:49] will never speak again I'm sorry
[01:39:55] uh
[01:39:58] also oh yeah I can walk on the water I
[01:40:00] forgot

[01:53:01] could do like uh I played a monoh hydro
[01:53:03] team with kokomi yolan finina Kaza it
[01:53:07] was pretty
[01:53:12] good thanks for the
[01:53:18] boss prototype Amber could help I don't
[01:53:21] know if it's enough but it would
[01:53:22] definitely help we could see if it's
[01:53:25] enough are best with Fina there's a
[01:53:27] seven minute or 5 to seven minute
[01:53:29] section in my finina guide talking just
[01:53:31] about
[01:53:33] healers uh I can go over it right now so
[01:53:36] that if I forgot anything Chad you guys
[01:53:38] can correct me but here is what I
[01:53:41] believe I
[01:53:45] said in terms of Fin's healers here's
[01:53:48] what you want to know
[01:53:53] BYU Jean oh yeah there's this D video
[01:53:56] too there you go but anyways baiju Jean
[01:54:00] and MAA Big Winners they heal all your
[01:54:02] team instantly Charlotte is also pretty
[01:54:04] similar can heal your team very fast all
[01:54:06] your team uh so those characters got a
[01:54:08] lot better Yaya's fine but needs more
[01:54:10] field time compared to baiju that's the
[01:54:11] main drawback cuz you need to be on
[01:54:13] field to like kill everyone so better
[01:54:15] Noel pretty cracked the only downside is
[01:54:17] you have to main DPS your Noel which if
[01:54:19] want to do that you want to play Noel go
[01:54:21] ahead but I wouldn't slot Noel into a
[01:54:23] random team
[01:54:25] um sa's like a budget Jean gets better
[01:54:28] with constellations not a bad option but
[01:54:30] jean is usually Jean so better uh
[01:54:33] Barbara is okay but you need a [ __ ] ton
[01:54:34] ER to burst and burst is the only thing
[01:54:36] that's going to heal everyone so it's
[01:54:37] kind of but yeah kakomi really good on
[01:54:41] field as a driver because you can heal
[01:54:43] everyone at the same time but uh off
[01:54:45] field uh is is okay too uh I didn't talk
[01:54:49] about Chi-Chi cuz it's [ __ ] Chi-Chi
[01:54:52] um I could talk about her Chi-Chi's
[01:54:55] healing is enough but she's also she
[01:54:57] doesn't really do anything other than
[01:54:59] just
[01:55:06] heal
[01:55:14] yeah uh I guess I could add
[01:55:18] that
[01:55:36] I was just chatting that so don't forget
[01:55:38] one two three but yeah CH doesn't do
[01:55:41] much else but at least she can heal
[01:55:43] enough uh diona no cuz dona's good but
[01:55:46] not with finina uh same with like
[01:55:48] Bennett and like like Bennett is like
[01:55:49] he's broken but it's like you'd have to
[01:55:51] swap through all your characters cuz
[01:55:52] you're only healing one dude at a time
[01:55:54] also he can't heal past 70% like he
[01:55:56] won't if you're over 70 so it's like a
[01:55:58] lot worse Kookie is fine cuz she damages
[01:56:01] you which gives you stacks and then
[01:56:02] heals you which just gives you Stacks
[01:56:03] but it's only one character at a times
[01:56:05] you have to be quick swappy and the
[01:56:06] healing is not like that good so you'd
[01:56:08] want like another healer with Kookie
[01:56:09] you'd want like two mid healers like you
[01:56:10] could do like ya Yao cookie in a denter
[01:56:12] team or like Ki cooki or like something
[01:56:14] like that um dory's Dory still dog [ __ ]
[01:56:20] uh you need a lot of er her healing is a
[01:56:21] bit better like her healing is fine but
[01:56:23] you need a lot of
[01:56:25] energy like
[01:56:29] yeah did they buff de
[01:56:34] higher did they buff de uh indirectly
[01:56:38] kind
[01:56:39] of they gave her more teams where she
[01:56:41] could be
[01:56:45] used so baiju is the best not object
[01:56:48] like Jean can be Jean is really good too
[01:56:50] Jean BYU alternatively yao
[01:56:54] yao uh and and then like Mika charlot
[01:56:58] are like the the the like new really
[01:57:00] good healers with
[01:57:02] her yao yao is like a a fourar version
[01:57:05] of like y sometimes better than BYU but
[01:57:07] with finina it's usually a bit worse
[01:57:09] same with uh saou in relations to Jean
[01:57:13] and barara in relation to
[01:57:18] kakomi
[01:57:27] H you're not going to go maiden's
[01:57:29] prototype Amber because the only reason
[01:57:32] you run prototype Amber on a character
[01:57:34] is because they're a good character if
[01:57:36] you're going maidens and Amber what the
[01:57:38] [ __ ] is left of your Nita like what the
[01:57:39] [ __ ] is your Nita going to do on
[01:57:41] maiden's Prototype Amber like just go
[01:57:43] [ __ ] a Healer at that
[01:57:44] point like it's a lot better to do
[01:57:48] baiju and like a strong like I don't
[01:57:50] know I don't
[01:57:52] know for Mona sure sure for Mona sure
[01:57:56] Mona's s doesn't matter sure but like
[01:57:59] [ __ ] Mona no Mona's fine you can you can
[01:58:01] do that you can do that I don't think I
[01:58:03] want to talk about that but like you can
[01:58:11] sure yeah you
[01:58:13] can cuz mona can go prototype uh F uh I
[01:58:17] was going to say five normally but you
[01:58:19] you go like protype Amber and then a
[01:58:20] healing set and then not care about the
[01:58:22] rest cuz you're just stacking ER and
[01:58:24] you're bursting
[01:58:26] sure but outside of like I I don't
[01:58:30] really I don't know man I don't think
[01:58:32] it's worth the one minute to talk about
[01:58:34] that
[01:58:37] personally
[01:58:40] maybe is SCU with finina no no not at
[01:58:43] all just run another uh
[01:58:48] Hydro I could test this on stream but I
[01:58:50] I did a bit of um Fina Hydro app
[01:58:55] testing uh and with someone like cout
[01:58:57] just go another hydro and then with with
[01:58:59] like Yia it managed to keep up though
[01:59:02] but even then it's like running double
[01:59:03] Hydro is just
[01:59:05] good wait
[01:59:10] me what's my jeans ER I'm on amoma amoma
[01:59:13] helps a
[01:59:18] lot
[01:59:20] but right now what I what I did with my
[01:59:22] Gene is I literally went to my pieces
[01:59:24] and I filtered by energy recharge and
[01:59:26] attack so er attack and then ER it
[01:59:30] doesn't like I was thinking should I go
[01:59:31] ano crit but then I realized my Jean's
[01:59:33] going to do like wow 40K damage so like
[01:59:35] it doesn't [ __ ] matter so I might as
[01:59:37] well just give her
[01:59:47] healing is be necessary yes don't there
[01:59:51] is objectively no reason to play an
[01:59:54] anemo healer if you're not a veres
[02:00:01] ventor unless you're like sh farizon
[02:00:06] Jean but even then you want to buff your
[02:00:09] your
[02:00:16] finina all right chat can someone uh let
[02:00:19] me in I need to do the boss
[02:00:21] again talk about Shena
[02:00:28] no I got a
[02:00:31] world I mean to be fair we could
[02:00:33] probably test her now
[02:00:36] but what the [ __ ] did I just copy
[02:00:41] paste
[02:00:45] boss my pace is not working oh [ __ ]
[02:00:57] what is Fin's best team
[02:01:01] yes
[02:01:03] yes that's like asking what Nikita's
[02:01:05] best team is what is caza's best team
[02:01:09] streamer what what's Bennett's best
[02:01:13] team Shang
[02:01:18] link
[02:01:23] it's always
[02:01:31] strangling let's light it up
[02:01:35] everybody everybody stand
[02:01:39] back oh [ __ ] I used it after my e
[02:01:41] expired I wasn't
[02:01:48] looking
[02:01:55] sharing my
[02:02:17] knowledge
[02:02:33] why why do you have four piece
[02:02:37] Echoes you want to explain why you farm
[02:02:39] four piece
[02:02:40] Echoes you don't even have a show
[02:02:44] here I love
[02:02:47] ayo
[02:02:50] word of advice don't break the law best
[02:02:53] of
[02:03:01] luck is M worth leveling now um maybe if
[02:03:05] you need a Healer in the fina team you
[02:03:07] can use
[02:03:07] mik memory you don't need him to be like
[02:03:10] the highest investment you just need
[02:03:15] healing I might die here
[02:03:23] over Barbados guide us
[02:03:27] hey let the world
[02:03:41] Collide I don't okay Charlotte's fine
[02:03:44] chat she's fine her healing is good it
[02:03:46] heals everyone her healing is good like
[02:03:48] if the yeah yeah I'm not sure what else
[02:03:50] she gives you
[02:03:54] um does she give you
[02:03:58] anything
[02:04:16] else tenacity I mean like
[02:04:28] like yeah you probably go fav on or M uh
[02:04:33] probably fav right probably go
[02:04:40] fav but her healing is not is pretty
[02:04:42] good for Fino
[02:04:45] so ma doesn't give you much either but
[02:04:49] it's like a bit of attack
[02:05:10] speed yeah can let me level their
[02:05:14] talents I lowy might have to [ __ ]
[02:05:16] kill Whopper flowers dude
[02:05:28] can I use full em vvg no no unless you
[02:05:31] have another healer your team no your
[02:05:34] healing skills on attack like finina
[02:05:36] okay part of what makes finina really
[02:05:38] really really welld designed in my
[02:05:39] opinion is you actually need healing
[02:05:42] okay let me make this clear your skill I
[02:05:44] tested this your skill in a rotation
[02:05:46] drains approximately 40 to 50 50% of all
[02:05:49] your character's HP 40 to 50 all of it
[02:05:53] which means and if you're ever under 50
[02:05:55] you do less damage on anyone so you want
[02:05:58] to always be healthy so you want a
[02:06:00] Healer that can heal everyone if your
[02:06:01] Jean's Q heals you for like 2 Hp she's
[02:06:04] useless you actually need healing which
[02:06:06] is nice I like that about finina cuz if
[02:06:08] finina didn't need healing she' be the
[02:06:10] best Hydro character by far like well
[02:06:12] her Hy drop still a bit less but who car
[02:06:14] like if you didn't need the healing
[02:06:17] finina coo would just be better than
[02:06:19] another Hydro character Kaza but you
[02:06:21] have to bench your Kaza for Gan a lot of
[02:06:23] the times you have to bch your Nikita
[02:06:24] for baiju you have to bch your [ __ ]
[02:06:26] Bennett for ma
[02:06:28] like like that helps balance her bit
[02:06:31] she's still really [ __ ] cracked but
[02:06:33] you actually need to build your healer
[02:06:35] which is nice that's cool that's a good
[02:06:37] thing that's a good
[02:06:47] thing I'll do a trial while this boss
[02:06:50] responds do B we'll do
[02:06:56] Charlotte is finina buff powerful as
[02:06:59] Bennett okay well Bennett is only attack
[02:07:00] per Bennett is still [ __ ] broken by
[02:07:02] the way uh but finina gives you correct
[02:07:05] me if I'm wrong chat but Talent level 10
[02:07:07] 300 Stacks should be 75% damage bonus to
[02:07:12] every party member
[02:07:14] everyone finina gets it
[02:07:17] herself
[02:07:19] your [ __ ] DPS gets it and your off
[02:07:21] field support gets it you have a Healer
[02:07:22] usually three of your four characters
[02:07:24] are going to be doing significantly more
[02:07:25] damage sometimes four maybe your healer
[02:07:27] is a bit but usually three characters do
[02:07:30] not 75% more damage but get 75% damage
[02:07:33] bonus which is a lot that's a
[02:07:39] lot so she's broken I I she's very very
[02:07:42] very good whoa Among Us sorry rain
[02:07:46] outlines your face
[02:07:51] how's Fino with sha uh if you have C4
[02:07:54] Gene especially
[02:07:57] good
[02:07:59] because okay to be fair disclaimer to
[02:08:01] all Shia Scara players any anemo man the
[02:08:05] current Abyss the doing the current
[02:08:07] Abyss with Shia or like an anemo DPS is
[02:08:10] like you're walking through glass baref
[02:08:12] foot while also having to scratch your
[02:08:14] nose but you can't scratch your nose and
[02:08:16] then you get home and your pillows warm
[02:08:19] that's what it feels like it feels like
[02:08:20] brushing your no I'm not going to do
[02:08:22] that again it feels like it feel yeah so
[02:08:25] listen it's disgusting okay it is not a
[02:08:28] good Abyss for any more characters like
[02:08:30] DPS is it's not our fault it's it's just
[02:08:33] unlucky power but in general yeah
[02:08:37] um that's cool normal ATT
[02:08:42] attack smile let me take damage on
[02:08:44] people but
[02:08:47] um free Ena gives damage buff even to
[02:08:50] elements that are hard to buff you can't
[02:08:52] swirl anemo like yeah you could [ __ ]
[02:08:54] swirl with Nemo characters but you can't
[02:08:56] vescent venor buff anemo right so damage
[02:08:58] buff the anemo characters like
[02:09:01] Scara pretty
[02:09:05] tasty did he just miss when I wasn't
[02:09:08] moving hold that rain outlines your face
[02:09:12] no my soul let me weave you a bur this
[02:09:14] [ __ ] showcase is Justus s
[02:09:17] ch
[02:09:27] Bond anniversary birth there you
[02:09:41] go gr gr gr the Temple of
[02:09:47] wisdom wait hear
[02:09:59] me do I do less damage if I don't kill
[02:10:01] that thing why am I doing like no
[02:10:05] damage shower me shower me
[02:10:17] with
[02:10:25] also chat you okay I've seen multiple
[02:10:28] people ask me about finina rotations
[02:10:30] literally all you do is EQ that's it if
[02:10:34] you're low HP swap to your healer right
[02:10:36] after to instantly heal everyone and and
[02:10:38] Max your fan Fair Stacks if not you just
[02:10:44] EQ I might make a new Gene guide cuz
[02:10:46] shimoi needs healing now so so like
[02:10:48] attack an emo crit might not even be the
[02:10:50] best right
[02:11:04] now so
[02:11:08] doain also with finina uh
[02:11:11] unironically you can run [ __ ] Mar CH
[02:11:14] on any DPS I [ __ ] hate that now fin
[02:11:18] makes every guide video ever 30 seconds
[02:11:22] longer every guide I'm ever GNA make is
[02:11:25] 30 seconds longer cuz you can probably
[02:11:27] play them with finina and if you do you
[02:11:28] can probably run mag CH hunter or
[02:11:30] Vermillion which hey hey verm
[02:11:33] hey I wish Mari chose was never born and
[02:11:36] we could just use Vermilion on every
[02:11:38] character however yeah there's going to
[02:11:40] be an extra 30 seconds in every guide
[02:11:41] being like yeah if you're playing finina
[02:11:43] you can use Mar so yeah if you're
[02:11:47] DPS that doesn't mean you always want to
[02:11:50] like there's sets that are still better
[02:11:51] than this right but it's 36 crit rate
[02:11:55] and normal Char attack
[02:12:04] [Music]
[02:12:13] damage uh yes to that's a fine
[02:12:17] build
[02:12:19] let's play
[02:12:22] Jiao need the help of an elder
[02:12:28] huh we can also play Yia I actually
[02:12:30] geared her I didn't get my yunen
[02:12:32] though
[02:12:39] but fina's probably really good with
[02:12:41] rizzly uh I would need to test it a bit
[02:12:44] more maybe we'll do that today uh I
[02:12:46] played B it was was kind of
[02:12:51] whatever don't if you ask what B Mar is
[02:12:54] I'm not going to answer by the way I if
[02:12:55] you either know or you don't
[02:12:59] know
[02:13:03] barbos why am I on
[02:13:11] Rust no wonder I have no [ __ ] burst
[02:13:13] I'm on Rust Faron shower me
[02:13:16] with I'm going to wait until I can for
[02:13:19] burst okay the
[02:13:21] world wait me truth
[02:13:25] repeat lament lament
[02:13:30] worthless where's my far
[02:13:33] on uh
[02:13:35] 85 that was 100 but domain
[02:13:43] [Music]
[02:13:45] buff like I usually despise playing Shia
[02:13:48] without Bennett I [ __ ] hate it but um
[02:13:52] with freut it's actually
[02:13:54] fine now imagine if I had C4 Jean
[02:13:58] imagine C4 Jean here
[02:14:02] oo that would be
[02:14:05] juicy why did you lock that it had
[02:14:07] attack and HP why is that a
[02:14:16] copium
[02:14:21] Fino with Soo we could try that it's
[02:14:25] fine Soo is good in quick Bloom and
[02:14:27] Hyper Bloom and finina is good for that
[02:14:29] so it should be fine it should be pretty
[02:14:31] good we can try it though it would be
[02:14:32] Soo finina
[02:14:35] BYU or or Nikita but then who's your
[02:14:39] healer Ki is probably not
[02:14:42] enough you could also double dendro no
[02:14:45] you probably won't you probably fishal
[02:14:49] BYU or like yao yao cookie or
[02:14:55] like yeah you could Nita by Drew but
[02:14:58] then that's
[02:15:01] like yeah we could we could try we could
[02:15:04] try I'm still on [ __ ]
[02:15:09] rust
[02:15:12] stri Barbados I played with uh I I F
[02:15:15] this Abyss with Al Albert hyam
[02:15:18] and uh and uh and finina it was fine
[02:15:22] finina gives you less Hydro than like
[02:15:23] yolan but that just means more quick and
[02:15:26] less hper
[02:15:27] Bloom
[02:15:31] worthless
[02:15:33] worthless useless
[02:15:45] boring I won't really work on that team
[02:15:48] uh I
[02:15:48] mean yeah but you can also
[02:15:52] like it's still probably fine to just
[02:15:55] like like after your rotation just press
[02:15:58] Q jump once and then
[02:16:00] swap but yeah uh yeah you want by you
[02:16:03] there or kakomi but then you're double
[02:16:05] hydro which is kind of bad actually yeah
[02:16:08] Ki would be bad what am I saying what if
[02:16:10] you do M why am I
[02:16:16] th
[02:16:18] does finina work with vasas no vuk
[02:16:22] kasha's glow is dog
[02:16:46] [ __ ]
[02:16:56] have fun with this
[02:16:58] game have fun with this G I swear by my
[02:17:04] sword lament lament he said the
[02:17:11] thing oh [ __ ] I I got bonked on him and
[02:17:13] I low
[02:17:16] punched
[02:17:21] nice like that's pretty good damage for
[02:17:23] no Bennett it's not
[02:17:26] bad I wonder if you
[02:17:41] could yeah
[02:17:44] no wait a second wait wait a second
[02:17:51] I don't have
[02:17:54] it wait a
[02:17:59] second okay chat one second what if
[02:18:02] hypothetically wait a second wait a
[02:18:04] second shut up wait a second what if
[02:18:06] hypothetically listen what if
[02:18:08] hypothetically we had ne's best slot
[02:18:10] right and we could restore 1%
[02:18:14] HP and then we could go we could we are
[02:18:17] yeah five that's 2% per particle okay
[02:18:20] finina heals herself then we run Bennett
[02:18:26] uh what's her name
[02:18:29] Faron let me
[02:18:32] cook wait actually okay okay okay I know
[02:18:36] Shia Shia Mains we're known for having a
[02:18:38] lot of copium okay I know
[02:18:40] that so let's say you don't
[02:18:44] have everyone shut up for a second this
[02:18:46] is important
[02:18:52] conquering demons is what I
[02:18:55] do you listen me on your team this is
[02:18:58] like the staple right you C4 Gene very
[02:19:01] nice boom boom boom boom boom okay let's
[02:19:02] e on C4 Gene Okay the reason you want a
[02:19:04] Healer like this is because fina's
[02:19:07] octopus seahorse and other thing crab
[02:19:12] suck your HP okay you want to be above
[02:19:15] 50% HP so your skill does more damage
[02:19:16] 40% more Dam very very good okay what if
[02:19:20] hypothetically you're like [ __ ] her
[02:19:22] damage you go MTH well far I already
[02:19:24] have MTH but whatever [ __ ] damage and
[02:19:26] then you're like it's okay if some my
[02:19:27] characters are low HP I don't give a
[02:19:29] [ __ ] cuz I'm still stacking my burst
[02:19:32] which is giving me damage for set
[02:19:34] Bennett's giving me attack farzon
[02:19:35] shredding the resistance [ __ ] dude the
[02:19:37] last thought of this team sucks balls
[02:19:39] anyways the last thought in a sh team is
[02:19:41] literally garbage anyways so what if
[02:19:44] you're just [ __ ] far uh finina and
[02:19:46] then who cares if you're your HP is low
[02:19:49] like it's fine who gives a [ __ ] if your
[02:19:51] [ __ ] Fin's damage is lower cuz you're
[02:19:53] buffing your
[02:19:56] sh dude the only thing to Toma does in
[02:19:59] this team the only thing he does is p
[02:20:02] resonance 20% attack and and and and and
[02:20:04] and or 25 uh I actually forget which one
[02:20:07] it is cuz it's been a while and 50%
[02:20:09] plunge damage which isn't bad but it's
[02:20:11] like
[02:20:12] bro let me
[02:20:14] cook
[02:20:16] 25
[02:20:18] Jang Lee Jang Lee diminishing returns
[02:20:21] pretty hard here cuz like you already
[02:20:22] have MTH on farzon and then you only get
[02:20:24] resistance tread with farizon also gives
[02:20:27] you let me
[02:20:29] cook and you have homop passive true LOL
[02:20:33] double true L well I mean Bennett's
[02:20:35] healing your sh it's just Bennett's not
[02:20:37] really going to heal farzon much or
[02:20:39] finina
[02:20:46] much
[02:20:48] [ __ ] it let's do one domain Let's test
[02:20:50] it in a in a good domain though what is
[02:20:52] the most efficient Vermilion test the
[02:20:56] Vermilion let me
[02:20:58] cook let me cook let me cook it's good
[02:21:02] never
[02:21:05] yes why is it loading so long it's like
[02:21:07] a
[02:21:08] warning it's fine I'm spping
[02:21:16] coffee
[02:21:24] finina healer CAC
[02:21:28] w why I just use yolan for her damage
[02:21:31] buff cuz yolan is cringe and you have
[02:21:34] the normal attack but it's like a slower
[02:21:35] normal attack than sing chos so you have
[02:21:37] to delay okay fun fact about Shia if you
[02:21:40] do this sing CH rain swords fire but
[02:21:43] yons are a bit slower so you have to
[02:21:44] like like you have to do like a slower
[02:21:47] jump I'm pretty sure I tested this a
[02:21:49] while back it's been a while but yeah
[02:21:51] it's
[02:21:57] cringe isn't it the opposite oh then
[02:22:00] sro's cringe wait is it okay s ch's
[02:22:02] cringe then one of them's cringe I just
[02:22:05] can't remember who's cringe evil
[02:22:07] conquering someone's cringe I don't know
[02:22:10] who but someone's
[02:22:12] cringe no we didn't get to stack
[02:22:16] it
[02:22:19] cuz one of the okay I guess it's SRA
[02:22:20] then oh okay my bad but yeah one of them
[02:22:22] one of the two's timing on jump cancels
[02:22:25] is [ __ ] disgusting I thought it was
[02:22:26] Yan but I guess it's inro so there you
[02:22:29] go then yeah there is no reason why not
[02:22:32] to do yon then off we
[02:22:41] go have fun with this game I should do
[02:22:45] this first Echo and S

[02:27:52] but
[02:28:04] three uh both her talents are important
[02:28:07] but this is probably smarter for
[02:28:10] us cuz dude you gain 2% which is a
[02:28:14] lot 2%
[02:28:17] well it's 0.2 I know it's 0 2 but like
[02:28:20] it's .2 time
[02:28:24] 300 which is 2 * three that's a lot of
[02:28:29] percent or is it
[02:28:32] 0.02 yeah it's 0.02 never mind 0.02 I
[02:28:34] mean
[02:28:36] still that's 6 divided by 10 which is 6
[02:28:40] I guess it's wait am I bad at math right
[02:28:42] now wait a
[02:28:43] second yeah yeah it's times 300 it's

[02:28:51] yeah but I also kind of want her to deal
[02:28:53] damage I think I'll do
[02:29:01] 77 lost student math it's Point okay
[02:29:04] it's
[02:29:05] 02 times
[02:29:10] 300 just still
[02:29:14] six but 7 seven
[02:29:17] 7 s's the Jeff true actually okay we
[02:29:20] have the 7 seven true actually true
[02:29:34] actually if we Ascend we get uh more CR
[02:29:38] so yeah we have 77 crit rate 77 again
[02:29:42] which is not
[02:29:43] bad this is actually pretty cracked if
[02:29:45] we get the more crit rate we have enough
[02:29:46] ER decent amount of HP um and this is
[02:29:50] like our worst set of the two
[02:29:53] our Mar is a lot better but our guilded
[02:29:56] is is okay I'm running off piece
[02:29:58] Vermillion of course I am uh the other

[03:11:23] need BYU here for
[03:11:24] sure and full em coomi maybe but then
[03:11:28] your your dental op is
[03:11:32] low yeah you could do
[03:11:36] this you could do
[03:11:40] this there are still so many places for
[03:11:42] us to expore yeah ya ya could work too
[03:11:45] actually K isn't a lot of healing no not
[03:11:47] at all cuz you're on full
[03:11:52] em winess I actually do like the ya Yao
[03:11:55] idea
[03:11:57] here don't fear Yo's
[03:12:02] here but then you don't even have a lot
[03:12:04] of
[03:12:11] hydro what we a Candace
[03:12:16] gigachad damage from Nita yeah I mean
[03:12:19] Nita is probably the best option cuz
[03:12:20] it's Nita
[03:12:27] but we could try it there are still so
[03:12:30] many places for us to
[03:12:36] explore who the [ __ ] am I
[03:12:39] wait I'm going to need em on like
[03:12:42] everyone not finina
[03:12:47] but BR you're going to die I
[03:13:09] mean why I put finina in the team
[03:13:14] I don't
[03:13:17] know I don't really see the benefit of
[03:13:19] fina in this team but I mean she she
[03:13:22] does
[03:13:41] damage
[03:13:46] yeah I think for her damage buff to be
[03:13:48] good you would need an actual on Fielder
[03:13:50] here you'd have to do like
[03:13:55] this like I think you would need an
[03:13:57] actual character in this
[03:14:00] team then who's
[03:14:03] blooming we'll need a
[03:14:11] strategy
[03:14:20] what's that join you for a
[03:14:24] walk why not I've been waiting for you
[03:14:28] for 300% ER I'll height
[03:14:33] them you want to have enough healing no
[03:14:35] let me cook let me cook we Bloom on Nita
[03:14:39] so we go full HP kakomi real but also
[03:14:43] true real but also
[03:14:48] true okay this doesn't work against a
[03:14:50] [ __ ] Electro dude so ignore this
[03:15:07] but gr gr make yourself at home shower
[03:15:11] me with time to oh I forgot
[03:15:14] nuu
[03:15:17] oops I forgot
[03:15:23] nuu okay I actually don't like this
[03:15:26] team without five characters if we had
[03:15:28] five characters I would like the team
[03:15:30] without five characters I actually kind
[03:15:32] of don't like it what if we onfield
[03:15:41] nuu
[03:15:55] yeah I kind of don't like
[03:16:00] it yao yao Nita yeah but then who the
[03:16:04] dude no one in your team has em then
[03:16:06] except
[03:16:11] Nita
[03:16:17] cuz like let's say it's this right let's
[03:16:18] say it's
[03:16:24] this what the [ __ ] is your like are you
[03:16:26] stacking em on finina is that what
[03:16:28] you're
[03:16:34] doing triple Hydro but then you have no
[03:16:36] healer if you do y
[03:16:41] on
[03:16:46] this her my knowledge don't be
[03:16:53] scared I should eat on Neu first this
[03:16:56] doesn't matter I just want to get an
[03:16:57] idea of what's going to
[03:17:02] happen I mean
[03:17:04] like against an actual enemy this is
[03:17:06] like functional
[03:17:11] probably
[03:17:18] yeah fin gets every bloom in the
[03:17:30] world why are we on vortex
[03:17:41] vanquisher
[03:17:42] I mean it's okay I guess like I could
[03:17:45] see it working but you you if you have
[03:17:49] key and finina can use the EM be a lot
[03:18:02] better where is ya
[03:18:11] Yao
[03:18:14] did we actually find the first onfield
[03:18:16] NE team ain't no
[03:18:25] way we doing
[03:18:35] Abyss hold up Rick I'm thinking one sec
[03:18:38] I'm thinking sorry I'm thinking thoughts
[03:18:41] I have to figure out if I like like Neu
[03:18:42] or not like with finina or
[03:18:44] not
[03:18:46] uh what the [ __ ] was the play was it ya
[03:18:49] ya Let's put Byer actually hopefully
[03:18:52] this won't take
[03:19:10] long Chad hear me out
[03:19:12] hear me out are you hearing me out yes
[03:19:13] or no pretend we bursted right pretend
[03:19:16] we used our burst taking a turn for the
[03:19:18] better my
[03:19:28] strength I
[03:19:31] mean I see everything I could see the
[03:19:34] aura what was the aura the world
[03:19:37] clim mind the side effects remember help
[03:19:41] here
[03:19:43] S dendra I mean they died too fast
[03:19:47] but there might actually be a [ __ ]
[03:19:50] onfield newo
[03:20:08] team why is NE on dull blade shut up
[03:20:19] wait let me look at who was
[03:20:25] blooming everyone help myled Chad you
[03:20:30] guys are now the
[03:20:32] students I'm not going to BU
[03:20:35] Dr it should be Hydro cuz they're just
[03:20:37] perad dendro right does the dentro ever
[03:20:39] get off of him I think he's still per no
[03:20:42] he's Hydro there wait till Nita blooms
[03:20:46] here and you have a bit of downtime so
[03:20:49] ya ya could

[03:21:12] [ __ ] I I tapped
[03:21:27] e yeah I don't see the need to like I
[03:21:30] agree I don't see the need to shove
[03:21:32] finina into Neu Bloom team I just want
[03:21:34] to see if it's worth mentioning or
[03:21:36] not I feel like Oki can actually onfield
[03:21:40] NE in this team though and you could
[03:21:42] probably fit ya Yao here instead of by
[03:21:43] if you
[03:21:55] want no fina's Al shouldn't buff the
[03:21:57] bloom damage but it's still like she's
[03:21:59] still good
[03:22:10] damage
[03:22:18] [Music]

[03:31:58] going to Shadow play that but it's going
[03:32:01] to include all of my
[03:32:09] audio
[03:32:13] get out soon yes it'll be out uh it's
[03:32:16] almost done it's being edited right now
[03:32:17] so probably within like before the end
[03:32:21] of Tom like within a day like hopefully
[03:32:23] tonight is the goal the goal is
[03:32:27] tonight I see
[03:32:29] everything no my sword witness power
[03:32:33] with me would you be better than C that
[03:32:36] team no I don't need more
[03:32:39] healing
[03:32:42] so okay like if you want you can put
[03:32:44] Gina that team but then you would go uh
[03:32:46] it allows it would allow you to go a
[03:32:47] different not kakomi so you could do
[03:32:49] like Ayo or nevet although nevet with uh
[03:32:52] yolan is kind of cringe
[03:32:55] but outside of
[03:32:57] that like you you you would bench uh
[03:33:01] Kaza for Gan if you need a Healer with
[03:33:03] finina but if you already have a good
[03:33:05] one like uh K on field then
[03:33:09] yeah
[03:33:15] probably should have started with Ki
[03:33:21] actually I'm actually not going to coo
[03:33:23] burst cuz [ __ ]
[03:33:31] that dude stop redeeming
[03:33:35] 1618 my ech what does that even have to

[03:48:41] the map is so big

[03:48:46] arm and it was
[03:48:50] strangling are you okay no I play
[03:48:53] genin why would you think I'm
[03:48:56] okay let the world
[03:48:59] C wait hear
[03:49:02] me of the stor too late [ __ ]
[03:49:07] useless EV conquering yeah I think he
[03:49:10] takes less damage when that thing's
[03:49:11] alive cuz like when I broke it he did
[03:49:13] like I almost fell off my chair so I
[03:49:17] think it supposed to break the little
[03:49:17] Duty summons look look look look look
[03:49:20] he's about to do it again
[03:49:23] Watch yes he's like oh yeah I actually
[03:49:26] think you do more damage to
[03:49:33] him have fun with this my why do people
[03:49:36] want my Jean B I mean yeah I'll show it
[03:49:38] I'll make an updated Gan guide it's
[03:49:40] going to be BYU charlot then Shang Ling
[03:49:43] Jean theuk true true true true true true
[03:49:46] true true true true dare to mess
[03:49:55] with uh I'm liter literally l i c h TR R
[03:49:59] Li on ER attack healing bonus it doesn't
[03:50:02] I'm just going Subs it's kind of
[03:50:05] whatever I'm just going attack and
[03:50:07] energy and healing
[03:50:10] I wonder if I BYU should go healing
[03:50:12] bonus or HP
[03:50:13] though usually I go HP on him but maybe
[03:50:16] three healing bonus is
[03:50:19] better me over five not really it
[03:50:22] depends I need the attack so I'm going
[03:50:25] am but five is good too am is really
[03:50:28] good
[03:50:30] though both are
[03:50:38] fine
[03:50:47] yeah I'm running a HP
[03:51:02] goblet would clam be good on Jean uh
[03:51:04] just just please get vescent you can
[03:51:07] just strong box it vescent is like you
[03:51:09] need veres on your account like I can't
[03:51:10] think of a single account do want veres
[03:51:12] unless you're playing literally like
[03:51:13] hyper Bloom on one team and like I'll
[03:51:14] height them on the other maybe but like
[03:51:16] even then just [ __ ] get get vescent
[03:51:19] yeah ocean clam is a lot better now like
[03:51:22] healers need healing more than they did
[03:51:25] like if you're not running them if
[03:51:26] you're running them with finina they
[03:51:27] need more healing so healer sets are
[03:51:29] actually viable but with an an emo
[03:51:31] healer you almost always want iredescent
[03:51:32] cuz even if you're only swirling Hydro
[03:51:35] it's a lot more damage cuz fin actually
[03:51:36] does a lot of
[03:51:38] damage
[03:51:53] attack CIT whichever you need more it
[03:51:54] doesn't matter like healing bonus is the
[03:51:57] easy answer but like yeah just go I mean
[03:52:00] they're both fine the thing is it's
[03:52:02] like if you like turbo optimize yourself
[03:52:06] you can probably go like attack or crit
[03:52:08] and like actually damage while having
[03:52:10] enough healing if your substats are good
[03:52:12] but then it's like does it really matter
[03:52:14] cuz your Gene's going to do like 40K
[03:52:15] it's like Okay cool so like you could
[03:52:18] just go for
[03:52:20] healing um
[03:52:23] yeah also if you don't care about your
[03:52:26] damage as much it's easier to get good
[03:52:29] healing so you let's say you're not
[03:52:31] looking for crit you can get a healing
[03:52:33] bonus Circ that has attack or ER on the
[03:52:35] substat but you can't get an attack
[03:52:36] circlet that has healing bonus on the
[03:52:38] substat so it it could be more efficient
[03:52:40] if you look at it like
[03:52:41] that but it depends like what other
[03:52:43] stats you
[03:52:47] want don't ask me about saou ER
[03:52:50] requirements I'm going be honest I I
[03:52:52] don't [ __ ]
[03:52:56] know but I'm pretty like if I were to
[03:52:59] guess 180 to 220 but
[03:53:07] like
[03:53:21] what should I do should I do another
[03:53:22] Abyss uh we'll do gilded

[04:10:21] yeah I think she's really good I think
[04:10:23] she feels pretty good in in a bunch of

[04:10:28] of teams where she doesn't feel

[04:10:32] question mark was
[04:10:34] NE I actually kind of like the Neo team

[04:13:10] more like you're deeper in the r
[04:13:12] cycle yeah there were there were there
[04:13:15] were some some some

[04:14:03] it Giga
[04:14:06] Chad
[04:14:08] man I don't I don't like one viewer raid
[04:14:10] cuz like well I don't know if it's
[04:14:13] someone who actually streams and like
[04:14:16] they're just like starting out and they
[04:14:17] don't have viewers yet I don't want to
[04:14:19] Don know all them but if it's someone
[04:14:22] [ __ ] trolling and like raing just
[04:14:24] just to see the notification I don't
[04:14:26] want to thank them so you're stuck there
[04:14:29] being like what do I do what do I do
[04:14:32] what do I do here see this is why this
[04:14:36] is why I mean to everyone
[04:14:37] freak you
[04:14:40] chat I just assume if it's one it's a
[04:14:42] troll cuz if it like if you're starting
[04:14:44] out like you you probably have like a
[04:14:46] homie or two supporting you and that's
[04:14:47] like two or three what if you don't have
[04:14:49] homie oh then you should join the Z or
[04:14:52] the Jeff Discord exclamation mark
[04:14:53] Discord in the respective chat boom plus
[04:14:55] one homie minimum true real real there
[04:14:59] you go I just fixed gen an
[04:15:06] impact
[04:15:09] oh yeah read the rules when you join
[04:15:16] true also
[04:15:19] okay dude why can like almost any
[04:15:22] character go maros
[04:15:25] now why not cuz it's so weird now every
[04:15:29] time dude looking at any character build
[04:15:31] is going to be weird
[04:15:33] now it's already weird I can't make fun
[04:15:35] of someone's ER or I get like quote
[04:15:37] tweeted like dude I made fun of some
[04:15:39] yol's build and then people were
[04:15:40] defending like the ER people were
[04:15:42] defending the like 130 ER like oh why
[04:15:44] he's actually C1 with Ryden and a saxing
[04:15:47] it's like dude oh what do you want now
[04:15:49] there's another layer I can't even say
[04:15:52] anything
[04:15:53] R yeah have you tried the wanderer team
[04:15:57] yes but my ma is dog [ __ ] so I like was
[04:15:59] Perma low HP so I wasn't getting buffed
[04:16:01] a lot I see but I'm I don't see why it
[04:16:05] wouldn't be good cuz you get like the
[04:16:06] cry infusion and you get
[04:16:08] hydro my thought on it is it's a
[04:16:11] Wanderer team that does not have a
[04:16:13] shielder yeah it's
[04:16:16] annoying I was thinking of BYU but then
[04:16:19] it's like why the [ __ ] would you
[04:16:22] yeah like then you don't have like what
[04:16:25] what is dendro doing there you're just
[04:16:27] blooming and then you like wander can't
[04:16:29] really synergize with
[04:16:33] it true you could see4 Gene there but
[04:16:36] [Music]
[04:16:40] yeah I don't know I don't know if I like
[04:16:42] it more than Bennett J Le though or like

[04:31:56] what team are you playing K me
[04:31:59] taser yeah I did the same thing but
[04:32:00] monoh hydro which isn't the same thing
[04:32:02] at all but it just replaces FAL with Yan
[04:32:04] so
[04:32:06] yeah it's just I I didn't used to like
[04:32:10] cooko me taser that much because it kind
[04:32:12] of just felt like an inferior version of
[04:32:14] suos taser in almost every situation but
[04:32:16] I feel like there's actual there's more
[04:32:18] upside to taser with li the fact that
[04:32:21] you just [ __ ] talk to my wife but yeah
[04:32:24] Ki taser feels pretty good or AO true as
[04:32:28] the rank one IO I can say I love IO I
[04:32:31] farmed eeko just for
[04:32:33] him and you're talking about playing him
[04:32:36] with Fino I farmed Echo just for
[04:32:40] him yeah I saying the same Tas team you
[04:32:43] want to use on him that's his best set
[04:32:47] now oh my [ __ ] God I forgot about
[04:32:51] that no [ __ ] way n no no did I no no
[04:32:56] no no to be fair Vermillion might be
[04:32:59] better on

[04:33:14] into this
[04:33:17] build zero cuz you weren't farming for
[04:33:19] him doesn't count well I I don't even
[04:33:22] have a dude even you can even manage as
[04:33:25] a sh
[04:33:29] dude
[04:33:33] yes it's so J for for me it
[04:33:38] is uh it's fine I actually love that you
[04:33:41] can dude if golden okay if mag say never
[04:33:43] came out I would be the smartest player
[04:33:46] right now cuz I would Vermilion
[04:33:48] everyone
[04:33:51] true true you I mean I still can it's
[04:33:54] it's okay what 36 crit rate versus how
[04:33:56] much attack is ver million again 18 plus
[04:34:00] that's 66 right yeah it's 60 something I
[04:34:03] don't know the second number
[04:34:06] that's it's one number n that's like you
[04:34:08] know n when when when a number is bigger
[04:34:10] than 10 it's still one number yeah but
[04:34:12] there's two numbers that make a bigger
[04:34:15] number okay
[04:34:20] well that's a lot of attack
[04:34:23] though and finina gives a damage buff
[04:34:26] which
[04:34:27] means doesn't mean anything but maybe
[04:34:30] you want more attack percent to go that
[04:34:32] damage ever thought of that king or
[04:34:33] queen I did
[04:34:39] maybe maybe it's you have a crit rate
[04:34:41] weapon and a crit rate Ascension wait
[04:34:43] hear me
[04:34:45] out like death mod shout hear me out
[04:34:49] finina with a Vermillion

[04:45:23] yet what are you doing just kidding
[04:45:25] don't feel forced to spend but she is
[04:45:27] really good I'm making a full guide It's
[04:45:29] Over 30 minutes right I'm going to try
[04:45:30] to lower it cuz I feel like long I don't
[04:45:32] know if you guys care if the guide's too
[04:45:33] long but I always feel bad if I video
[04:45:34] too long so I'm going to try to cut it n
[04:45:35] she's mid no you're mid and [ __ ] dumb
[04:45:37] shits in chat call every character mid
[04:45:39] even if they're good or bad [ __ ] you and
[04:45:41] [ __ ] everyone who's ever T I'm sorry I'm
[04:45:44] kidding you're cool I'm just kidding but
[04:45:45] she's really good you don't need her
[04:45:47] though why because you might not I don't
[04:45:49] know your account um you might not
[04:45:51] because there's a lot of good Hydro
[04:45:52] characters so you know you might have
[04:45:55] already good teams you might have
[04:45:56] nevette yolan SRO kokomi all of them
[04:45:59] together there's a lot of good Hydro
[04:46:01] characters but Fino's really good
[04:46:04] especially if you can fit a heal on your
[04:46:05] team her damage bonus is really good so
[04:46:08] if you like her if you want her if you
[04:46:10] need Hydro characters if you want to get
[04:46:12] another Hydro character if you want to
[04:46:13] use hydro characters together kind of
[04:46:15] like how yolan is good with SRO so is
[04:46:21] finina being too popular can be such a
[04:46:24] hassle then yeah who knew the people
[04:46:26] would adore me so
[04:46:29] much oh she's very good why is he having
[04:46:32] sudden outbursts I'm sorry
[04:46:34] I'm normally more normal than this I
[04:46:36] don't know what's wrong with me today I
[04:46:38] apologize I apologize to the one chatter
[04:46:40] I I'm sorry I I don't know what's what's
[04:46:43] happening I think it's cuz I think it's
[04:46:45] cuz I got donut ever since I got BYU's
[04:46:51] donut I'm sorry I don't even know how
[04:46:54] this happened dude it is what it is it
[04:46:56] is what it is uh key is better key is
[04:46:58] really good on her uh
[04:47:00] doio it depends on your team if your
[04:47:02] team doesn't use em then not really but
[04:47:05] uh like it's not as good but if your
[04:47:06] team can use em then Key's really
[04:47:14] good like genuinely her teams are finina
[04:47:18] then an AOE like a good healer like BYU
[04:47:20] Jean ma shot whatever and then Flex Flex

[04:47:39] I'm going to try to rush it out but it
[04:47:41] always takes a long to make these guys
[04:47:43] there's probably other Freo videos that
[04:47:44] are out now but I assume they're like 15
[04:47:46] minutes minus 30 because I think it's
[04:47:49] like I genuinely don't know how it would
[04:47:52] be possible to make a video of this
[04:47:54] length SL quality not saying that it's
[04:47:56] like high quality but like whatever with
