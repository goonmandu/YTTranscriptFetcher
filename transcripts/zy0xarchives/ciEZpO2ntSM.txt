[00:15:03] it's not stun
[00:15:05] loock it's actually not STL this
[00:15:10] time I was I was thinking about hyper
[00:15:12] Bloom for a while now I was like should
[00:15:13] I make a video talking about it and I
[00:15:15] kind of left that in my idea bank and
[00:15:17] yesterday I saw this video from genon
[00:15:20] scientist I actually like G scientist
[00:15:22] good content overall uh you know go
[00:15:25] watch it Banger uh and I I was looking
[00:15:28] other I saw this one too uh and I read
[00:15:31] the comments and the comments tilted me
[00:15:33] video's not bad though video's good uh
[00:15:35] but the comments here kind of tilted me
[00:15:37] uh where is
[00:15:40] this
[00:15:42] dude we chat I have to making my
[00:15:45] lifelong Mission if you guys remember me

[00:15:50] to be that cookie is not needed for
[00:15:52] hyper blo I want that to be my my legacy

[00:15:57] hyper blo today
[00:15:59] uh for user planetary
[00:16:01] rendevu because this is a common uh
[00:16:04] misconception a lot of people think this
[00:16:05] when it's not

[00:16:09] electro character in the
[00:16:12] game ficial anyways uh welcome to the
[00:16:17] stream uh but yeah anyways uh this video

[00:16:27] only thing is I feel
[00:16:29] inspired to myself talk about hyper blo
[00:16:32] kind of separate points so I might make
[00:16:33] a video on at some point I'm going to
[00:16:35] wait before uploading it cuz I don't
[00:16:36] take any traffic from this video like I

[00:17:38] new
[00:17:39] playlist what is this
[00:17:42] playlist I don't want to listen to
[00:17:46] this I also don't want to listen to this
[00:17:49] dude I have no playlists they're all the
[00:17:53] [Music]
[00:17:57] same
[00:18:02] whatever
[00:18:04] um whatever I'll just play this okay
[00:18:08] welcome we have a lot to do uh also
[00:18:12] apparently the abyss reset a lot about I
[00:18:14] I opened my genin it was [ __ ] it says
[00:18:17] floor A3 so we might have to do that as
[00:18:19] well
[00:18:22] um and you know maybe we'll get to show
[00:18:25] off some some hyper blo you know maybe
[00:18:27] we'll get to maybe we'll get to you know
[00:18:30] without cookie maybe we'll get to show
[00:18:31] off uh you know Su girl
[00:18:36] official playlist last updated December
[00:18:39] 15
[00:18:41] 2011 about hyper to play with DMC
[00:18:46] colle okay I don't care if the op like
[00:18:50] any math or like simulator tells you
[00:18:53] that Kay DMC hyper blo is the best free
[00:18:55] to-play team if you're running Cole over
[00:18:57] a good character you are actually
[00:19:00] griefing your life I'm actually sorry I
[00:19:03] know you can do like Barbara Cole DMC
[00:19:06] but you're griefing get Singo oh Singo
[00:19:08] is not free to play he's in the [ __ ]
[00:19:09] monthly shop so if you play the game for
[00:19:11] more than three months you can get him
[00:19:12] true or four months five I don't know
[00:19:14] but you can get
[00:19:17] him
[00:19:19] anyways anyways h k is great in y teams
[00:19:23] yeah absolutely she can also be used in
[00:19:25] 15-second rotation teams not bad with
[00:19:27] like kaching
[00:19:29] but guess what we're not talking about
[00:19:30] that we're talking about hyper blo and
[00:19:32] if you use colay and Hyper
[00:19:36] Bloom it can work well okay I think
[00:19:40] it's I'm pretty sure it's actually good
[00:19:42] if you're playing like Barbara but I
[00:19:44] don't understand why people make it okay
[00:19:47] this is going to tilt me also this is
[00:19:48] another thing that tilts me again not
[00:19:50] about I I we should watch I don't think
[00:19:52] it's not about that video it's about
[00:19:53] like random commenters people that use
[00:19:56] like I see people talk this is like the
[00:19:57] other video that s lock me not this one
[00:19:59] this one's good uh the like people that
[00:20:02] assume your freeo playay hyper Bloom
[00:20:03] team is like [ __ ] sorry is like
[00:20:09] Barbara
[00:20:11] DMC so where the [ __ ] is DMC Barbara DMC
[00:20:15] colay and like some random garbage
[00:20:22] dude if you if you
[00:20:26] dude Lisa
[00:20:31] true what is
[00:20:36] Lisa dude like if you're coping this
[00:20:38] hard you have bigger problems than the
[00:20:40] reaction I'm sorry like I'm actually
[00:20:43] sorry you have bigger problems of on
[00:20:45] your genant account that you need to
[00:20:46] solve and it's not like oh swipe it's
[00:20:48] literally like learn to build a team I'm
[00:20:50] sorry like
[00:20:57] I
[00:21:00] cuz I'm going to say it there's two
[00:21:02] options either you play the game for a
[00:21:05] little bit and then you get a lot of the
[00:21:07] four stars passively through not only
[00:21:08] free through events but also monthly
[00:21:10] shop or pulling on any Banner or you
[00:21:12] don't play for a long time well then
[00:21:14] there's two options either you're new
[00:21:15] and then you're going to probably pull
[00:21:16] on whatever Banner is there in which
[00:21:18] case you can either build a team around
[00:21:19] a five star or add that five star to
[00:21:21] your team
[00:21:23] or do what you can with the characters
[00:21:25] you have Shang Ling's free you make a
[00:21:26] Shang Ling team
[00:21:30] funny thing is you can clear this oh
[00:21:31] absolutely well ah yes okay yes you can
[00:21:35] however I wouldn't use Lisa here but
[00:21:38] like yes you can clear with like
[00:21:40] anything with Hyper Bloom provided you
[00:21:42] have
[00:21:44] em but the thing is it's
[00:21:47] like if your argument is like this isn't
[00:21:49] a free to- play Team then it's like bro
[00:21:51] like these are 1.0 characters that are
[00:21:53] in the monthly shop well sugr isn't but
[00:21:57] you know
[00:22:01] like you don't need you might have
[00:22:02] cookie but you don't need cookie if you
[00:22:04] do have cookie use her if you
[00:22:09] don't um who is I going to put
[00:22:12] DMC
[00:22:14] right and let's say like
[00:22:22] man
[00:22:26] man man
[00:22:30] honestly if you don't have sugr you
[00:22:32] could probably do like you could even do
[00:22:34] Lisa like the reason I was kind of Ming
[00:22:36] on Lisa wasn't cuz Lisa's that bad it's
[00:22:38] literally cuz if you're playing like
[00:22:40] pick a struggle like you can have a bad
[00:22:42] Electro and do have a good hyper Blom
[00:22:44] team you can have a bad hydro and have a
[00:22:45] good hyper Bloom team you have a bad
[00:22:47] dendro and have a good hyper Bloom team
[00:22:48] but if all your slots are bad that's
[00:22:50] that's more than like the re oh the
[00:22:52] reaction doesn't carry me it's like pick
[00:22:54] a dude like at certain point you don't
[00:22:56] have Sr you don't have kie or official
[00:22:58] or sucros or like any dendro character
[00:23:01] it's like bro like what are you doing
[00:23:03] like if your account isn't made to hyper
[00:23:05] blo and you you're more geared towards
[00:23:07] other
[00:23:08] teams hyper might still be better but
[00:23:11] sure go for those other teams but like
[00:23:14] it's fine but what's nice also is um
[00:23:17] Shang Lang has some pretty good teams
[00:23:18] that don't even need s so you could do
[00:23:19] like
[00:23:20] uh 16 18 where the [ __ ] is whatever you
[00:23:24] get the point I don't know where rosari
[00:23:26] is
[00:23:33] can we switch to JP voice just for the
[00:23:35] spiral of this yeah yeah I'm trying not
[00:23:38] to mention like the damage just of the
[00:23:40] reaction cuz I I understand like I
[00:23:44] fundamentally understand that literally
[00:23:46] just hyper blooming is enough to meet
[00:23:49] The Nine Star floor 12 clear son is
[00:23:51] finally born like uh the the like when
[00:23:54] the time like I understand that
[00:23:56] right but it's also like if you're
[00:23:59] playing Barbara Cole Lisa like what are
[00:24:02] you doing like it's still going to clear
[00:24:04] but like why is that the team that you
[00:24:06] build like do you have zero four stars
[00:24:09] maybe like maybe you're doing like a I'm
[00:24:11] playing only freeto playay characters
[00:24:12] sure but outside of that why would you
[00:24:14] like why would you do
[00:24:17] that the C DPS on a good condition it's
[00:24:20] barely enough okay but that argument
[00:24:23] doesn't make sense cuz barely
[00:24:25] enough okay barely enough when you're
[00:24:28] playing essentially like characters
[00:24:30] Without Limbs is like really good like
[00:24:33] barely enough when you're playing dog
[00:24:35] [ __ ] unit I'm sorry Cole players but dog
[00:24:38] [ __ ] unit outside of n
[00:24:40] Bloom
[00:24:41] and almost dog [ __ ] unit with
[00:24:45] Lisa and you're nine starring floor 12
[00:24:48] you
[00:24:50] know that's like good but like it's the
[00:24:53] team is bad like the team is bad but if
[00:24:56] you but yeah I don't know how to explain
[00:24:58] it any more than that without like
[00:25:00] thinking about it
[00:25:03] more like okay K is not bad but like
[00:25:09] genuinely like I don't think there's
[00:25:12] another dendo character in the same tier
[00:25:14] as her like almost like okay objectively
[00:25:17] okay cave never mind Cav's worse well
[00:25:19] yeah Cav's worse
[00:25:22] but
[00:25:24] yeah like she's not like bad it's just
[00:25:28] there's better D characters almost
[00:25:33] always for hyper blo if you're again if
[00:25:37] you're a nuu player and you like Cole
[00:25:39] that's cool we're not talking to you
[00:25:40] right now that's cool that's
[00:25:46] cool what do you mean cave is bad don't
[00:25:48] talk to me right now I'm not trying to
[00:25:50] this isn't my opinion right now I'm not
[00:25:52] talking as an opinionator right now okay
[00:25:55] I I I love cave no disrespect I'm just
[00:25:57] saying actually okay to be fair to Cave
[00:26:01] I would rather play this like I would
[00:26:03] much rather play like this hyper Bloom
[00:26:06] team but you're running premium premium
[00:26:07] like he takes time on
[00:26:12] field like if you're doing Barbara
[00:26:14] Barbara's not going to really Hydro from
[00:26:15] off field much like her ring is like
[00:26:17] pretty like it's okay it's not great
[00:26:21] then your Electro is g to be like you
[00:26:23] need c you need either some Electro
[00:26:25] right you want something like Lisa
[00:26:26] wouldn't really
[00:26:29] yeah
[00:26:31] anyways
[00:26:37] anyways
[00:26:40] anyways
[00:26:44] sunlock but I'm also like my point isn't
[00:26:47] even that the the like I I don't even
[00:26:50] care if this team is good enough my like
[00:26:52] the Barbara team is good enough my point
[00:26:53] is usually you can do better like I have
[00:26:56] genuinely
[00:26:58] I I maybe I've seen one account in my
[00:27:01] like hundreds of accounts that I've
[00:27:02] looked through where I would actively
[00:27:05] like recommend that team it's like dude
[00:27:09] 99% of the time you have something
[00:27:10] better and if you don't you're going to
[00:27:12] get something better in like one patch
[00:27:14] of playing the game so at that point
[00:27:16] like why would you turbo invest in these
[00:27:18] characters well I guess they can
[00:27:20] placehold your artifacts but still like
[00:27:26] yeah
[00:27:31] on K is not bad no onfield K is pretty
[00:27:33] good for um pretty much any team that
[00:27:36] needs an on Fielder like a Hydra on
[00:27:38] Fielder she is
[00:27:39] good sometimes it'll like if you don't
[00:27:41] need the healing you you'd rather use
[00:27:43] like a damage dealer but it's
[00:27:46] fine what's the song
[00:27:52] Beautiful H for the record I'm not stun
[00:27:54] locked I chose to talk about it this
[00:27:56] isn't like I I had to like I chose to
[00:27:59] talk about it this is like I feel like
[00:28:01] talking about hyper
[00:28:03] boom I felt like it [ __ ]
[00:28:24] it but also yeah yeah oh another thing
[00:28:28] is
[00:28:30] uh this so we can watch this video
[00:28:33] together but the thing is if I if I
[00:28:35] watch this video while I'm stun lock
[00:28:36] people think I don't like the video but
[00:28:37] I actually like the video it's like
[00:28:39] separate like I'm ranting about other
[00:28:40] [ __ ] but anyways the the only thing I
[00:28:45] don't agree with in ter um the only like
[00:28:48] meta take that is like true that I don't
[00:28:52] agree with despite it being true is the
[00:28:54] like the the the the like spam argument
[00:28:57] of like high SE High floor low ceiling
[00:29:00] where like it's true hyper Bloom
[00:29:02] automatically brings you to a pretty
[00:29:03] high like decently High floor and then
[00:29:05] the ceiling is like lower than like a
[00:29:06] Meta Even like Shia right now like Shia
[00:29:08] shenyun finina like it's going to clear
[00:29:10] way faster than my random ass hyper
[00:29:12] Bloom team that's
[00:29:15] true but does that matter and then the
[00:29:19] answer is well it depends what you're
[00:29:20] playing for but if you're looking up
[00:29:23] guides and you're trying to clear Abyss
[00:29:25] like that's like what you're trying to
[00:29:26] do the the odds are you'll be able to do
[00:29:29] that with something like hyper Bloom
[00:29:31] before you can do it with your like
[00:29:33] certain carries that are a lot better
[00:29:35] than hyper Bloom eventually right but
[00:29:38] then it's like does that matter like I
[00:29:40] in an Ideal World yes you want to do as
[00:29:42] much as you can but the reality is all
[00:29:44] you need is Nine Stars and after that
[00:29:46] there's no more content so it's like the
[00:29:49] floor is like the floor being high is
[00:29:51] like really really big it's like such a
[00:29:54] big deal that it doesn't really matter
[00:29:57] for for people that are looking
[00:29:59] to just clear the abyss or like have the
[00:30:03] strongest teams that they can for now if
[00:30:07] a a hyper invested team of a hyper carry
[00:30:10] will do better than their like just em
[00:30:13] main stat team right so that that's
[00:30:16] basically the
[00:30:18] thing it's not that the ceiling doesn't
[00:30:20] matter the ceiling does matter but it's
[00:30:22] like in my opinion a lot less relevant
[00:30:25] it's it's more for fun like I care about
[00:30:27] this ceiling I've been farming crit for
[00:30:29] like over 3 years now right so like I
[00:30:32] care but like if you're looking up like
[00:30:35] what's good and you care about okay well
[00:30:37] how well not look how do I say this if
[00:30:40] you're trying to clear the
[00:30:41] abyss the team that's going to be
[00:30:43] recommended to you isn't the Hy the
[00:30:46] hyper invested team it's the oh well
[00:30:47] this team has Hydro Electro dendro it's
[00:30:50] always going to be pretty good and it's
[00:30:52] very easy to build and it's very
[00:30:53] flexible you can close your eyes spam
[00:30:55] buttons and your rotation is going to be
[00:30:56] good right right okay and because it
[00:31:00] gets spam recommended people think it's
[00:31:02] the automatically the best team okay but
[00:31:04] the reality is while that's not
[00:31:06] necessarily true it's still going to be
[00:31:07] spam recommended because the people that
[00:31:09] need recommendations are people that
[00:31:10] can't clear the abyss if you're asking
[00:31:12] me hey man I cleared the ab in 30
[00:31:14] seconds but I want your opinion on who's
[00:31:17] better Shia or hyam like I'll answer you
[00:31:19] I'll tell you but actually I don't want
[00:31:21] to open that can of worms right now I'm
[00:31:22] lying to you but you
[00:31:24] know generally I'll Hy them although
[00:31:27] we'll not get into it but you know let's
[00:31:28] say you're asking that then we can talk
[00:31:30] about that but if you're asking me hey
[00:31:31] man I can't clear floor 12 I I'm two
[00:31:34] starring it I'm one starring it what's a
[00:31:36] team that I can build without needing to
[00:31:38] spend five years of my life farming
[00:31:40] domains I'll probably say hyper Blum and
[00:31:42] Shang Ling or something like that right
[00:31:44] and like that's kind of the point that's
[00:31:47] kind of the point and uh zff pointed me
[00:31:49] out the the the team simulation of a
[00:31:53] hyper Bloom team that's random I think I
[00:31:55] bookmarked it I did bookmark it
[00:32:05] wait where is
[00:32:18] it this is the rotation of this
[00:32:20] simulated team
[00:32:23] okay let a equal random if a is one
[00:32:26] right en Ryden skill attack if two yolan
[00:32:30] skill burst attack if three SRO skill
[00:32:33] burst attack if4 Nikita skill burst
[00:32:36] attack and then in between you just
[00:32:38] randomly
[00:32:40] swap like this is like a rotation of
[00:32:42] randomly swapping and it still did
[00:32:48] fine but
[00:32:55] anyways it's it's literally like yeah
[00:33:08] anyways link I can link it I I don't
[00:33:11] know
[00:33:12] how like I don't know who made this but
[00:33:15] I like
[00:33:20] it I am sorry to ask but it's a genuine
[00:33:23] question what's the best Shang Ling team
[00:33:30] Shang Ling
[00:33:31] Bennett
[00:33:37] Hydro I'm gonna say child Kaza generally
[00:33:41] I'm gonna say that generally but there's
[00:33:43] a there's a lot of good strangling
[00:33:50] teams why is AA so low this isn't like
[00:33:52] an actual
[00:33:55] list
[00:33:57] all right [ __ ] it call meun locked I
[00:33:59] don't care we're watching this guys
[00:34:01] there is no but okay let me preface this
[00:34:03] by saying I like this content creator he
[00:34:05] makes Banger content so go check him
[00:34:07] out this should be an anti- stun law cuz
[00:34:10] I assume we're going to agree on a lot
[00:34:11] of things denying that in the past year
[00:34:13] and a half hyper has been kind of a
[00:34:15] guaranteed re I'll also link it in chat
[00:34:17] G all you need for it to function is a
[00:34:19] solid D drop player I think I already
[00:34:21] linked it application and elro character
[00:34:24] built with elemental Mastery that can
[00:34:26] trigger the H
[00:34:30] although you don't need cie that can
[00:34:33] trigger the hyper
[00:34:34] consistently day just for fun I went to
[00:34:37] my Discord server and typed hyper boom
[00:34:39] in the search bar and got this as a
[00:34:41] result hyper boom is [ __ ] hyper Bloom is
[00:34:44] bad if this theme is so good why there
[00:34:46] are such oh yeah I've also seen the
[00:34:49] like enable CC sure I've also seen the
[00:34:53] like takes of I don't know what to call
[00:34:55] these like
[00:34:57] these type of takes but like the people
[00:34:59] that are like super endgame and tcing
[00:35:01] their super endgame speedrunning and
[00:35:02] they're like yeah hyper Bloom is [ __ ]
[00:35:05] because I clear in 20 seconds and my
[00:35:08] hyper Bloom team clears in 40 or it's
[00:35:10] like well you still have to farm em
[00:35:12] we're not going to get into it negative
[00:35:14] opinions about it sure a possible
[00:35:16] explanation could be that my Discord
[00:35:18] server is just dumb but uh I think the
[00:35:21] actual reason is more complex than that
[00:35:23] truthfully the conversation is quite
[00:35:25] split on the matter because you have
[00:35:27] people that say this I'm just standing
[00:35:29] here and everything's dying with Hyper
[00:35:31] Bloom and you will have others that say
[00:35:33] this instead hyper blo itself does not
[00:35:35] do anywhere near enough damage to solo
[00:35:37] carrier being good so what's dude how do
[00:35:40] you even say that sentence out loud
[00:35:42] let's find
[00:35:44] out the main reason people like hyper
[00:35:46] Bloom is that it's probably the most
[00:35:48] sure prooof way to achieve damage in the
[00:35:50] genine I was listening to my friend's
[00:35:52] bfer video on the matter the other day
[00:35:54] and at one point he goes like this hyper
[00:35:57] Blum is simply a good source of sub DPS
[00:35:59] that you can incorporate into teams
[00:36:01] consisting of already good synergistic
[00:36:03] units that do damage sorry buddy I think
[00:36:06] that's understating it while it's
[00:36:07] technically true that Hy is a source of
[00:36:09] sub DPS that can come from off field and
[00:36:12] in this way it's similar to what
[00:36:13] characters like Fishel can do with odds
[00:36:16] in my opinion framing it as such is kind
[00:36:18] of underestimating the magnitude of this
[00:36:20] Elemental reaction for example let's
[00:36:23] take a composition where the hyper booms
[00:36:25] damage is on the high end so a double
[00:36:27] hydroc comp with shinchu and Yan n is
[00:36:29] the dandr player and cookie as the
[00:36:31] electr player on a team like this since
[00:36:33] you get a lot of hydro application even
[00:36:36] with pretty bad execution you will still
[00:36:38] be able to get at least 20 hyom SP
[00:36:40] rotation that's another thing like I
[00:36:42] talked about this earlier but like you
[00:36:44] literally can close your eyes Mash your
[00:36:46] mouse buttons and your keyboard and you
[00:36:47] will clear like I get it oh you're using
[00:36:50] good characters but like literally it is
[00:36:52] so brain dead assuming you're giving
[00:36:54] your cookie an elemental Mastery SP like
[00:36:56] iron stick thing and the Paradise Lost
[00:36:57] as the artifact set with elemental
[00:36:59] Mastery main pieces in this scenario
[00:37:01] you're Crossing 700,000 damage per
[00:37:04] rotation with cookie pretty easily to
[00:37:06] context to L how big this is let's say
[00:37:08] that you use the same double hydrocore
[00:37:10] on the team but with Hut and jungle you
[00:37:12] replacing cookie and wa how much is that
[00:37:14] I kind of spaced out 700 easily to
[00:37:17] contextes how big this is let's say that
[00:37:19] you use the same double hydrocore team
[00:37:22] but with Hut and Jung replacing cookie
[00:37:24] and N of course Hut is acting as the
[00:37:26] main DPS here and I remind you all that
[00:37:29] this is still one of the most popular
[00:37:30] team she has in order for Hut to match
[00:37:33] the damage cookies deing on her own
[00:37:35] composition she will need pretty nice
[00:37:37] Talent level investment quite great
[00:37:39] artifacts and a pretty good fourstar
[00:37:41] weapon option no but no but 200 crit
[00:37:45] value level 10 Talent battle pass that's
[00:37:48] all easier than em main stat right no no
[00:37:51] it has to be it's so much easier and
[00:37:53] keep in mind that in terms of
[00:37:55] theoretical single Target d damage huto
[00:37:57] is still one of the best DPS we have in
[00:37:59] the game while there are more
[00:38:01] differences between the two teams aside
[00:38:03] from the damage just huto and cookie are
[00:38:05] dealing the point I'm trying to make
[00:38:06] here is that at its peak hyper broom's
[00:38:08] output is comparable to that of a main
[00:38:10] DPS and sure Hut's total damage can get
[00:38:13] a lot higher on teams that are more
[00:38:15] focused on magnifying her output but
[00:38:18] yeah but oh is he going to say what I
[00:38:19] was about to say considering that hyper
[00:38:20] Blom is doing this on a team that also
[00:38:22] slots in seriously strong sub DPS it has
[00:38:25] nothing to end compared to most main DPS
[00:38:28] sources and this is truly what made
[00:38:30] hyper Bloom so popular within the
[00:38:31] community reaching levels of damage that
[00:38:34] other characters can only achieve by
[00:38:36] breaking through more expensive lers
[00:38:38] yeah okay that's L I was going to say
[00:38:39] cuz you can do the same on hyper Bloom
[00:38:41] you can add alyon there and then
[00:38:43] suddenly oh [ __ ] I have a real damage
[00:38:45] dealing character that's not Barbara
[00:38:46] Cole investment something people often
[00:38:49] underestimate about hyper BL is that you
[00:38:51] don't actually need this much Hydro up
[00:38:53] going to say a nice level of damage in
[00:38:56] fact if if you play both shinan on a
[00:38:58] team you will often have too much Hydro
[00:39:01] application what I mean by this is that
[00:39:02] if you generate more than two hyper
[00:39:04] blooms in a single instance only two of
[00:39:06] them will D the opponent and that's
[00:39:09] because of the internal cool down of the
[00:39:10] elemental reaction on a team that uses
[00:39:12] both Shino and Yan this happens a lot so
[00:39:15] generating it also happens a lot when
[00:39:17] you [ __ ] like your koui up time dies
[00:39:19] and then you like do your rotation you
[00:39:20] swap to C and there like 80 cores on the
[00:39:22] ground in a single shot and then you're
[00:39:24] like [ __ ] I suck remove one them from
[00:39:27] the team you won't stray away from that
[00:39:28] ceiling of hyper boom damage that much
[00:39:31] and this allowed less conventional teams
[00:39:33] like a double hyra with cocoi or fridge
[00:39:35] teams to flourish of course if you
[00:39:37] remove one of shinan you're losing on
[00:39:39] some raw damage but you're replacing it
[00:39:41] with more utility so some people like it
[00:39:43] the ease of use is also pretty
[00:39:45] impressive specifically the lack of
[00:39:47] restrictions in terms of rotation and
[00:39:49] I'm not dud it's so brain dead you
[00:39:52] literally can't play it wrong compar
[00:39:55] teams actually can't oh [ __ ] I used
[00:39:58] cookie before my hydro oh
[00:40:00] wow that it realistically makes it more
[00:40:03] fible
[00:40:05] I basic setup in terms of ability
[00:40:07] activation there is not really that much
[00:40:09] here that is set in stone about
[00:40:11] rotations this makes it much easier for
[00:40:13] it to adapt to [ __ ] enemy movements
[00:40:15] and patterns than it is for most teams
[00:40:17] the combination of high based damage and
[00:40:20] may made hyper Blom a big one of Hope
[00:40:22] for many players the sentence just use
[00:40:25] hyper Bloom EAS not a meme you can just
[00:40:27] slap hyper BL on to many themes and it
[00:40:29] will make them decent at the very least
[00:40:31] like not super great but at the very
[00:40:34] least decent and able to clear the base
[00:40:36] and yet some people dislike hyper
[00:40:39] blo I be dude yeah I I I remember you
[00:40:44] [ __ ] I roasted your hyper clear
[00:40:47] cuz you cooky bursted the [ __ ]
[00:40:49] Electro Bird yeah it's immune sorry but
[00:40:53] see that's a perfect example if the
[00:40:55] average gen player has the same I'm
[00:40:58] sorry no disrespect has the same level
[00:41:00] of intellect as you you can still clear
[00:41:03] with Hyper blo but maybe playing like
[00:41:04] Hut or Shia might not be your level and
[00:41:07] that's okay that's okay that's the
[00:41:09] strength of the team that's cool if if
[00:41:11] you just want to close your eyes and
[00:41:12] mash buttons I do that then the hyper
[00:41:15] blooms for
[00:41:17] you that was kind of [ __ ] I'm sorry
[00:41:20] but true though be completely honest now
[00:41:23] I don't typically use hyper Blom themes
[00:41:25] the reason is that there is sort of a
[00:41:27] limit to the damage hyper blo teams can
[00:41:29] deal on teams that are fully focused on
[00:41:32] hyper Bloom damage you typically have a
[00:41:33] d drop player that is not dealing much
[00:41:36] damage himself due to the lack of quick
[00:41:37] and consistency I drop players that are
[00:41:39] filling a nice sub DPS rule but that are
[00:41:42] clearly not receiving any kind of
[00:41:44] particular help from teates in terms of
[00:41:46] support and an anro character that is
[00:41:48] built with elemental Mastery pieces to
[00:41:50] maximize the hyper Bloom damage true
[00:41:53] however what if you do something like hm
[00:41:58] Alam maybe finina maybe
[00:42:02] maybe I kind of want to say sucr
[00:42:04] official but I don't know if that's just
[00:42:05] me coping because I like sucro so I'm
[00:42:07] not mon sub version I'm sure Yan's a
[00:42:10] better character particular help from
[00:42:13] teammates in terms of support and an
[00:42:15] anro character that is built with
[00:42:16] elemental Mastery pieces to maximize the
[00:42:18] hyper Bloom damage on this type of theme
[00:42:21] in terms of artifact investment it gets
[00:42:23] really hard to noticeably improve its
[00:42:25] performance if you already found a
[00:42:27] correct set for your Electro character
[00:42:30] for one once you've reached a certain
[00:42:31] level of Elemental Mastery on your
[00:42:33] character it gets quite hard to get more
[00:42:36] this is like like this is what I'm going
[00:42:38] to say here if I'm a cookie mate and I
[00:42:41] love Kookie like I love Shia yeah I'm
[00:42:44] going to want to be the best [ __ ] I
[00:42:46] want to be the number one sh I'm going
[00:42:47] to want to [ __ ] one shot everything
[00:42:49] and going from good hyper Bloom to
[00:42:52] Better is like almost not nothing but
[00:42:54] like it's not as
[00:42:57] noticeable however most people that are
[00:42:59] playing the hyper BL team aren't like I
[00:43:01] [ __ ] love Kookie yes sing yes I love
[00:43:04] you usually it's just like wow I can
[00:43:07] clear this with my brain off and I only
[00:43:08] have to farm for a month and now I can
[00:43:10] spend all my resin maxing the character
[00:43:12] I like which is cool imagine if I got a
[00:43:16] th000 em on Sha and then I didn't have
[00:43:18] to go
[00:43:20] Vermillion but this is still a very
[00:43:22] valid um like a very valid point on your
[00:43:26] character it gets quite hard to get more
[00:43:28] and anyway the way the formula works the
[00:43:30] more Elemental Master you get the
[00:43:32] smaller the relative increase you get in
[00:43:34] terms of damage weapons wise you can
[00:43:36] pick anything but at the end of the day
[00:43:38] if it doesn't have elemental Mastery
[00:43:40] it's not going to positively impact its
[00:43:42] damage of the damage on the team so the
[00:43:45] row damage the Andro and hydro
[00:43:46] characters are dealing you can of course
[00:43:48] increase that through artifact
[00:43:49] investment and so on much more but since
[00:43:52] each of them is typically dealing a
[00:43:54] minuscule part of the team damage it's
[00:43:56] not going to matter that much wait what
[00:43:59] but the the last video we watched said
[00:44:00] it was just a little bit of sub DPS and
[00:44:02] that yolan would be carrying but how is
[00:44:04] it 56% here if yolon the five star unit
[00:44:07] who's also pretty high in sorry I'll
[00:44:09] shut up um a minuscule part of the team
[00:44:12] damage it's not going to matter that
[00:44:14] much of course there are a few
[00:44:15] exceptions to this like the quick that's
[00:44:17] what I was talking about so teams were
[00:44:19] the I think the middle ground of of
[00:44:23] people being like um I think the middle
[00:44:26] ground personally and if I make a video
[00:44:29] I will I will highlight this the middle
[00:44:30] ground of people being like wow like
[00:44:32] hyper Loom is only a really good like
[00:44:35] boost to like a high floor but low
[00:44:36] ceiling and the people that are like
[00:44:38] well like the people that want to just
[00:44:40] clear and the people that want to clear
[00:44:42] super fast look if you want to just
[00:44:44] clear and you want a free to playay team
[00:44:45] that can clear there's a lot of four
[00:44:47] stars that make a really strong hyper
[00:44:48] Bloom team with like almost not almost
[00:44:50] no but like
[00:44:51] very very much less investment time than
[00:44:54] a the same build on a crit carry whereas
[00:44:58] if you want to fully Max it and you
[00:45:01] really care about hyper Blom that much
[00:45:02] then explore the CM save your Primo
[00:45:05] drams and get someone like Alam because
[00:45:07] then you'll have very meta competitive
[00:45:09] DPS while still playing a hyper BL team
[00:45:12] boom you have Alam Nita finina or you
[00:45:14] don't need three five stars you can do
[00:45:15] like [ __ ] uh bench finina ghosting TR
[00:45:18] boom two four stars there ideally you
[00:45:20] have Alam Nita true but maybe you could
[00:45:22] [ __ ] bench Nita too that that
[00:45:23] wouldn't be ideal but you can themes so
[00:45:26] teams where the dendro or the electro
[00:45:27] character become a meaningful source of
[00:45:29] raw damage dealing on this teams you
[00:45:32] typically pick a hydro character that is
[00:45:34] not applying that much Hydro because
[00:45:36] that way you'll be able to maintain
[00:45:38] quick and up time more consistently on
[00:45:40] opponents as a reminder generating
[00:45:42] blooms deactivates the Quicken status on
[00:45:44] opponents this means that if you use a
[00:45:46] very strong Hydro applier like aino you
[00:45:48] will basically have no Quicken these
[00:45:50] subtitles are [ __ ] like I know he didn't
[00:45:51] make think they're automated but like a
[00:45:53] sh and regardless of the D
[00:45:56] you pick you will just be running team
[00:45:59] on the flip side a character like furina
[00:46:01] makes things quite balanced because
[00:46:03] she's not a great Hydro applier what
[00:46:05] typically happens on furina teams is
[00:46:06] that you get much less hyper Bloom
[00:46:08] damage but the Quicken up time is much
[00:46:10] more frequent and ironically enough
[00:46:12] these are the teams that include hyper
[00:46:13] Bloom that I like the most because they
[00:46:15] allow great raw damage dealers like
[00:46:17] alham or to stand out more while it's
[00:46:20] technically true that you can still
[00:46:22] increase hyper Bloom's output through
[00:46:24] things like an aita's conation to the
[00:46:26] same is true for Quicken so I don't
[00:46:28] think that's a very good argument and at
[00:46:30] the end of the day the bottom line here
[00:46:32] is that it's truly impressive what your
[00:46:34] characters can do if you hyper invest on
[00:46:36] them the other day I was looking at this
[00:46:38] guu m speedrun guu a character that many
[00:46:41] people believe to be weak nowadays but
[00:46:43] it's still quite astounding what she can
[00:46:45] do when hyper invested and this applies
[00:46:48] to any character really anybody can pick
[00:46:50] his main hyper invest on him and then
[00:46:52] get these very impressive runs the truth
[00:46:55] is after you play the game for a long
[00:46:57] time you're eventually going to get
[00:46:58] pretty good artifacts the more you fall
[00:47:00] into this deep artifact tail the more
[00:47:02] you're going to be attracted by this
[00:47:04] kind of hyper invested stuff so in a way
[00:47:06] the more you play the game in a certain
[00:47:08] way the older hyper Bloom can grow for
[00:47:10] you hyper Bloom is for sure the safest
[00:47:13] path you can make to achieve a certain
[00:47:14] level of damage at minimum but it comes
[00:47:17] a point where you don't need to play it
[00:47:18] safe anymore truthfully it's not like
[00:47:20] this for every player though because
[00:47:22] there are still players that have played
[00:47:24] for a long time but don't care about all
[00:47:26] of these hyper stuff and that's how
[00:47:28] teams like nuet hyper blo or brle fridge
[00:47:30] are Bor do you know how easy it would be
[00:47:33] do you know how much better my life
[00:47:35] would be as a Shia man if hyper blo
[00:47:38] didn't exist and I could just chill
[00:47:39] everyone to pull sha it would be a
[00:47:41] beautiful world we' have so many Shad I
[00:47:44] want to hate it but I don't that should
[00:47:46] tell you
[00:47:51] enough this is a stun lock I'm not even
[00:47:54] going to read it nice try you you got
[00:47:56] paid by the government to Stun loock
[00:47:59] Me So teams that kind of lower the
[00:48:01] potential damage of the main DPS
[00:48:03] compared to the norm in this case net
[00:48:05] rezzly in exchange for more hyper blooms
[00:48:08] and so higher floor damage and honestly
[00:48:10] this is where I think the hate for hyper
[00:48:12] Bloom stems from so this Mania from some
[00:48:14] people that want to slap this reaction
[00:48:16] onto every team if you tell main that
[00:48:19] has I yeah like I'm pretty sure the
[00:48:21] hyper Bloom nevet teams are like they'll
[00:48:24] work but like it's literally worse than
[00:48:26] DEA there because de gives you like a
[00:48:28] Vape Plus Interruption like resistance
[00:48:29] Interruption plus you don't need a
[00:48:31] Healer like there's teams that are
[00:48:33] better for
[00:48:34] nevet unless Cals have changed like I'm
[00:48:36] not like refreshing this every day but
[00:48:39] Mania from some people that want to slap
[00:48:41] this reaction onto every team if you
[00:48:43] tell a nuet main that has hyper invested
[00:48:45] in his character to play the hyper boom
[00:48:47] variant you will probably just get a big
[00:48:49] Fu USI response just because in this
[00:48:52] case it's never heard swees the main
[00:48:55] potential the character to benefit a
[00:48:57] second place style that honestly doesn't
[00:48:59] synergize that well with him so it's
[00:49:01] definitely something that depends on how
[00:49:02] you play the game personally I can
[00:49:04] definitely relate to the people that is
[00:49:06] like hyper Bloom because at my level of
[00:49:08] investment on my account it just doesn't
[00:49:10] make much sense for me to use hyper Blom
[00:49:12] themes I have many constellations many
[00:49:14] signature weapons and a lot of great
[00:49:16] artifacts so I just don't need it many
[00:49:19] people like to say that hyper BL is
[00:49:20] unbalanced because it gives you too much
[00:49:22] damage for free but in my opinion it's
[00:49:24] perfectly balanced because it comes with
[00:49:26] pros and cons this perception of hyper
[00:49:28] Blum as the Ultimate Weapon of G genin
[00:49:31] kind of makes it overrated that's why I
[00:49:33] mostly disagree when people say things
[00:49:34] like oh there is hper Boom so there is
[00:49:37] no point in me pulling for that
[00:49:38] character or playing this character
[00:49:40] because the truth is that many of these
[00:49:42] characters that people do post or just
[00:49:44] gold [ __ ] have an top potential that can
[00:49:47] push them higher than these hyper boom
[00:49:49] themes and I'm done for today if you
[00:49:51] enjoy this video please I agree with
[00:49:53] almost everything the last point
[00:49:57] true fob the last point of like the
[00:50:01] point that I like to make is like hey
[00:50:04] because you have basically free single
[00:50:08] Target team if you want to do it you
[00:50:11] should never feel like you need a DPS
[00:50:13] that helps you in single Target you can
[00:50:15] get it like Hut is great Yia can work
[00:50:18] she can but it's like you should never
[00:50:20] be like [ __ ] I need them cuz you don't
[00:50:23] like you're fine you can clear you can
[00:50:25] clear any boss Day 2 Bill if you just
[00:50:28] Farm a little bit7 M
[00:50:33] 65367 overated that's why but also um I
[00:50:37] think at like this like my level
[00:50:39] investment you don't need hyper blo but
[00:50:42] the thing is it's like you're still
[00:50:43] probably
[00:50:45] like who's like probably top three DPS
[00:50:49] well this guy okay how do I build a team
[00:50:51] with him okay well I'm going to do then
[00:50:53] I want Electro to Quicken and then well
[00:50:56] I might as well have a [ __ ] hydro and
[00:50:57] then I'm hyper bling like yeah it's
[00:50:58] quick Bloom but like you know we're
[00:51:00] probably going to be [ __ ] hyper
[00:51:04] bling and it's like if hyper Bloom
[00:51:06] wasn't good then you would just pure
[00:51:07] Quicken like if hyper wasn't good this
[00:51:09] team would like always be better or like
[00:51:12] uh maybe not that one but like Jong Le
[00:51:14] and like Fishel right or like bet or
[00:51:17] some [ __ ] what up
[00:51:23] slice you need perfectly B because it
[00:51:26] comes with pros and cons this perception
[00:51:28] of hyper blo as the Ultimate Weapon of
[00:51:30] genin kind of makes it overrated that's
[00:51:32] why is better than
[00:51:36] finina you're benching finina for
[00:51:44] FAL n surely
[00:51:47] not say things like oh there is I boom
[00:51:50] so there is no point in me pulling for
[00:51:52] that character or playing this character
[00:51:54] because the TRU truth is that many of
[00:51:56] these characters that people do post but
[00:51:58] like this is a really good like most of
[00:51:59] my S comes from like the arguments I've
[00:52:01] heard not from this video this is good
[00:52:03] uh good
[00:52:08] overall so
[00:52:10] Banger go support the
[00:52:13] goat
[00:52:18] um why is he drinking soy sauce dude you
[00:52:21] [ __ ] this is coffee it's just black
[00:52:23] coffee link the video again sure I
[00:52:27] um I'll straw box with you slice I
[00:52:30] pre-typed the comment I said well said
[00:52:33] okay cuz I lowkey pre-at but don't like
[00:52:35] I pre-at but I didn't watch all of it
[00:52:37] like I pre-at parts of
[00:52:40] it I pre-at the like the bad part not
[00:52:43] the good
[00:52:44] part some people
[00:52:47] like not all of it I said well said the
[00:52:51] problem I had with the high floor low
[00:52:53] ceiling take is that while it's true
[00:52:54] getra unfortunately doesn't doesn't have
[00:52:55] any content harder than floor 12 because
[00:52:57] of that when players are looking for gu/
[00:52:58] help to reach that DPS threshold a team
[00:53:00] that can relatively easily clear floor
[00:53:02] 12 hyper Loom is I forgot a comma is
[00:53:05] often times very good at doing that
[00:53:06] because of how high the floor is and how
[00:53:08] flexible it is in sense of easy
[00:53:09] rotations and having three to four
[00:53:11] unique and useful elements in your
[00:53:17] team you did a good job pointing out
[00:53:24] the lack of needing it for already
[00:53:29] seasoned players who have many
[00:53:32] well-invested
[00:53:34] DPSS as well as
[00:53:37] the sort
[00:53:39] of high end of hyper Bloom SL
[00:53:44] quick Bloom teams with
[00:53:47] alham SL
[00:53:51] finina or
[00:53:54] others
[00:53:56] you're going to reach the limit little
[00:53:58] bro holy
[00:54:16] essay Mr socks you mentioned fast clears
[00:54:20] in Abyss what do you think about this
[00:54:22] fast
[00:54:24] clear
[00:54:25] why did you link me a Reddit
[00:54:36] clear I'm not watching this
[00:54:40] um as well as the sort of highend of
[00:54:43] hyper Bloom SL quien teams with Al
[00:54:45] height them for I lost my train of
[00:54:47] thought what was I
[00:54:48] saying it's I can't think I was do the
[00:54:54] world
[00:55:06] cream
[00:55:10] uh I think a lot of the
[00:55:16] overring is mostly
[00:55:18] for clearing
[00:55:21] the is Forest time for is mostly for
[00:55:25] first time clearing Abyss where
[00:55:31] the EM investment needed usually is a
[00:55:35] lot easier than the crit team
[00:55:43] Alternatives thumbs up
[00:55:49] emoji what do we
[00:55:51] think bro
[00:55:53] stop is this not a good it's a support
[00:55:56] of comments he ain't reading all
[00:56:17] [Music]
[00:56:21] that yeah I might make um
[00:56:26] a video about hyper at some point but
[00:56:30] anyways good video

[01:01:25] been a while since we got some GE reruns
[01:01:27] either albo or
[01:01:30] Ito there's a very high chance that we
[01:01:33] see them today and if we see both chiori
[01:01:36] and another geoc character then that
[01:01:39] means that this stupid [ __ ] who
[01:01:42] has no friends no one that loves them
[01:01:44] and no one who wants to sit next to them
[01:01:46] at the lunch
[01:01:47] table might be back and in the abyss and
[01:01:50] if that
[01:01:53] happens not going to be happy so we'll
[01:01:56] see hopefully not hopefully not
[01:01:59] hopefully not hopefully
[01:02:04] not

[01:03:03] and no disrespect but if they release
[01:03:05] chori albo and itto in the same patch
[01:03:08] it's going to be the most dead patch in

[01:03:15] the world like nobody cares I'm actually

[01:09:31] time to Abyss before it reset um comes
[01:09:33] out
[01:09:36] worthless can can you please play your
[01:09:38] I'm not reading that dude I didn't I
[01:09:41] don't have a moaning compilation that's
[01:09:43] not AI is getting out of
[01:09:50] hand why are you farming Vermillion this
[01:09:52] is why
[01:09:54] this is
[01:09:56] why that could actually be good that
[01:09:59] could actually be
[01:10:03] good I'm not going to say it I
[01:10:22] see
[01:10:29] is Jade fall good on shinan oh Shen okay
[01:10:32] you
[01:10:38] misspell what does Jade fall even give
[01:10:40] again why do I have this [ __ ]
[01:10:44] weapon
[01:10:46] energy
[01:10:49] damage uh restore energy gain damage
[01:10:52] bonus for the corresponding element of
[01:10:53] tie for 1% to
[01:10:58] 12% yeah eh
[01:11:17] no have you why would I have seen
[01:11:20] someone react to my Bennett guide what
[01:11:22] is there to react to
[01:11:24] how is that a reaction wow good guide
[01:11:26] thanks
[01:11:28] man how do you react to a
[01:11:35] guide although I could make a new better
[01:11:37] guy there's probably some new stuff
[01:11:40] there's finina now so you can actually
[01:11:41] build some different stuff and um
[01:11:46] yeah there's also
[01:11:52] uh what what else is there there's
[01:11:57] uh yeah C6 now is like a lot more
[01:11:59] relevant that's what I was trying to say
[01:12:01] C6 is a lot more relevant now cuz finina
[01:12:03] and shenyun actually there's a lot of
[01:12:05] good teams with C6 like I think I should
[01:12:08] activate it at this point because of
[01:12:10] shenyun there's actually a lot of stuff
[01:12:12] you can do now which is cool Benny team
[01:12:16] I might
[01:12:22] eventually po was playing gen looking to
[01:12:25] play genin and looking at the reasons
[01:12:26] why not to C6
[01:12:27] Bennett if that's still a contingence
[01:12:30] issue then I will make an updated video
[01:12:32] on it I could actually make an updated
[01:12:33] short that'll take like 40 seconds to
[01:12:35] make might be better maybe I will if
[01:12:38] people are still wondering I don't want
[01:12:39] them to get like 2-year-old information
[01:12:41] I think it's worth I think at this point
[01:12:43] in the game it's worth C sixing for
[01:12:47] sure granted even a year ago I would say
[01:12:50] like it's whatever like it's not bad to
[01:12:52] activate it unless you're like a Ula but
[01:12:55] even with Ula it's like you don't really
[01:12:57] care cuz Ula teams don't use benit and
[01:13:00] if you do you're trying to speedrun get
[01:13:01] a big like you're not speed on you're
[01:13:02] trying to get a big number to screenshot
[01:13:04] and even if you're doing that doing
[01:13:05] pyran normals doesn't really matter I
[01:13:07] don't
[01:13:11] think I might all that's a good short
[01:13:13] idea let me write it
[01:13:17] down uh idea short of C6
[01:13:22] Bennett update with Shun finina stuff
[01:13:27] also maybe a new Bennett guide question
[01:13:30] mark the guide isn't outdated though
[01:13:32] like it's not well it's like at this
[01:13:34] point I should update it for Fina but
[01:13:36] the information there is still good the
[01:13:37] only thing is now with finina you can
[01:13:39] actually stack healing on Bennett like
[01:13:40] there's a reason to want healing whereas
[01:13:43] before there's like none so
[01:13:46] yeah
[01:13:47] anyways the loot guide is outdated [ __ ]
[01:13:50] you yes it is but [ __ ] you
[01:13:59] but every time I read comments I think
[01:14:01] it's more of a hot take to like the I
[01:14:04] think average people still would rather
[01:14:06] go uh Skyward Bennett so you know you
[01:14:10] can do
[01:14:12] that but um yeah although to be fair I
[01:14:17] think with finina skywards probably the
[01:14:20] best not because aquilla's worse because
[01:14:23] like objectively speaking base attack is
[01:14:25] just like theoretically if your
[01:14:27] artifacts are perfect base attack's
[01:14:28] always better because you can't build
[01:14:29] base attack on your artifacts you can
[01:14:31] build ER you can't build base stack but
[01:14:34] if you actually care about your healing
[01:14:35] and you're playing finina you need a lot
[01:14:37] of ER and you also need a lot of HP so
[01:14:39] that's kind of
[01:14:44] hard flat attack
[01:14:47] on Richie you have been subbed for three
[01:14:51] months please tell me that was an ironic
[01:14:55] please tell me that was
[01:14:57] ironic please
[01:14:59] confirm please
[01:15:10] confirm but yeah base attack doesn't
[01:15:13] count towards uh sorry flat attack isn't
[01:15:15] base attack it's not the
[01:15:20] same
[01:15:22] fire with
[01:15:25] rocks fire well with rocks you're so
[01:15:28] goofy Navia you're so silly you're so
[01:15:33] goofy let's
[01:15:37] begin stay cool face
[01:15:39] your at
[01:15:41] you oh Also to clarify in case cuz I
[01:15:44] don't know if it I don't want this to
[01:15:46] seem like I took a stance on something I
[01:15:48] don't mind people like reacting or
[01:15:49] watching my guides if anything it's free
[01:15:51] publicity like I'm I just I meant it as
[01:15:54] like
[01:15:54] a like when someone was like they
[01:15:57] reacted to your guy it's like okay like
[01:15:58] did
[01:16:00] I I think the word watched is more
[01:16:09] appropriate hi Mr ZX can you check my
[01:16:13] eia ID 712
[01:16:18] m924
[01:16:20] 195
[01:16:22] uh
[01:16:23] no but thanks for 100 bits I I
[01:16:26] appreciate it I appreciate
[01:16:28] it jice will
[01:16:32] PR did
[01:16:33] I okay here's the thing you know when
[01:16:37] like the teacher you're like teacher I
[01:16:39] really have to pee and they're like
[01:16:40] listen
[01:16:43] here Umberto that's your name for the
[01:16:45] situation listen here Umberto if I let
[01:16:48] you pee I'm going to have to let
[01:16:49] everyone else go pee and then you go pee
[01:16:51] and then everyone else raises their hand
[01:16:53] everyone goes to PE and then the class
[01:16:55] never progresses and now personally I
[01:16:57] think that's kind of [ __ ] you should
[01:16:58] let your [ __ ] students go PE however
[01:17:01] they have a point if I do your account
[01:17:04] review right I review your uid for 100
[01:17:06] bits then that then every 100 bit I'm
[01:17:09] going to be stun locked for 2
[01:17:12] minutes however I do kind of hate that
[01:17:14] teacher and I don't want to be that
[01:17:16] teacher so just for you we'll do the
[01:17:18] review fine fine let me find this it is
[01:17:21] EU though
[01:17:23] which means I'm going to have to use Ena
[01:17:24] but it's
[01:17:27] fine
[01:17:30] um
[01:17:32] 71 2 90 2
[01:17:39] 495 all right what did you say review my
[01:17:42] sh okay this is good uh crit rate
[01:17:52] C4
[01:18:21] out I I have to make make sure this is
[01:18:23] real give me a
[01:18:29] second I'm
[01:18:31] sorry give me a
[01:18:44] second is my game going to crash Why did
[01:18:51] it
[01:18:53] wait I didn't copy the U oh yeah okay I
[01:18:55] got
[01:19:06] it yeah [ __ ] you slime I didn't get the
[01:19:08] Parry though
[01:19:13] uh who the [ __ ] is
[01:19:19] trunks
[01:19:21] anyways
[01:19:24] shower
[01:19:25] review that's good that's concerning but
[01:19:38] good I just want you to understand for
[01:19:41] reference that Shia
[01:19:42] C4 is the biggest m is one of Humanity's
[01:19:47] biggest mistakes it's not the worst
[01:19:50] thing that we've ever done
[01:19:54] but it's up
[01:19:57] there uh I assume yes okay I assume you
[01:20:01] want to get C6 maybe it's like a it's a
[01:20:05] placeholder that's fine Vermilion let's
[01:20:08] look at your build that's good uh 47 em
[01:20:10] is wasted but still really
[01:20:13] good I don't like
[01:20:15] you that's pretty okay that was [ __ ]
[01:20:18] this a good feather uh this is okay I
[01:20:20] mean I say okay because my standards are
[01:20:21] really high but this is good this is all
[01:20:23] so really
[01:20:25] good I don't like
[01:20:31] you I don't like you I'm sorry I get
[01:20:34] jealous around Vermillion uh it's a good
[01:20:37] CH you need more well you don't need 70
[01:20:40] like 70 is fine but you at that level
[01:20:42] investment crit ratees a lot more
[01:20:43] valuable than crit damage uh however
[01:20:46] I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
[01:20:47] you get crited with someone like shenyun
[01:20:49] so you Pro you
[01:20:51] know what is this by the way what
[01:21:01] the that's fine I guess I
[01:21:04] mean uh two vescent is kind of
[01:21:07] useless you could be like o the er's up
[01:21:10] that is so good but in reality you have
[01:21:12] the signature so you don't need that
[01:21:13] much ER and you're running sh you're
[01:21:14] probably running farizon so like you
[01:21:16] probably don't need the er
[01:21:21] um
[01:21:23] but yeah yeah pretty good
[01:21:25] sh um I would just try to get more CR
[01:21:30] rate now if you thought I would let you
[01:21:32] off the hook that way clearly you must
[01:21:33] be new here I mean that easily 30 crit
[01:21:35] damage on a circlet 30 crit damage on a
[01:21:38] feather uh dice
[01:21:41] roll all right one to six you get a six
[01:21:44] you are banned for 17 years
[01:21:51] unlucky all right wait do I have any
[01:21:53] plls on this
[01:21:56] account waa three PS sorry
[01:22:13] sorry c0 X listen
[01:22:20] me okay yo I literally said that if I
[01:22:23] let one of you go pee I'll have to let
[01:22:25] everyone go pee and I didn't want that
[01:22:27] please stop chucking bits for a review I
[01:22:29] can't I I I I like I appreciate I can't
[01:22:32] oh we got nothing do I have a free pull
[01:22:36] maybe I
[01:22:40] do [ __ ] wait surely I have more
[01:22:43] somewhere
[01:22:46] events
[01:22:48] [ __ ] um
[01:22:51] well
[01:22:58] Don know all his own
[01:23:01] mods true wait there's so many skins the
[01:23:07] [ __ ]
[01:23:09] wait okay it's now March sing Show's in
[01:23:12] the shop you for for from now on you are
[01:23:16] not allowed to cope about hyper Blom and
[01:23:19] play [ __ ] Barbara and and then
[01:23:20] complain about it he is now I am deeming
[01:23:23] him free to play for this month okay get
[01:23:26] your
[01:23:37] SRO and for reference my freeto playay
[01:23:40] Asia account has enough star glitter to
[01:23:42] get srol well I bought a blackl pole
[01:23:44] instead but I have enough leftover to
[01:23:46] where I could get a uh s show and I
[01:23:47] don't even pull on that account
[01:23:51] anymore v r donated
[01:23:58] $5 I literally just said I couldn't I
[01:24:01] just said I
[01:24:09] couldn't minus 24 star glitter wait
[01:24:11] blackl pole is not bad why are you [ __ ]
[01:24:13] talking of blackl
[01:24:21] pole
[01:24:34] if you [ __ ] do blackl pole you are free
[01:24:36] to play phobic cuz sh wow that took so
[01:24:40] long to load what the [ __ ]
[01:24:44] sh oh I don't have a black Liff he has a
[01:24:46] lot of good options but not ever has a
[01:24:48] free play option so you might have to
[01:24:49] blackl if not you can missive wi spear
[01:24:51] missive is actually potentially better
[01:24:53] it depends on the up time of your
[01:24:54] passive but usually it's better because
[01:24:56] black Li pull is hard to proc the stack
[01:24:57] so usually I would go miss it but it's
[01:24:59] an old event so you might not have it uh
[01:25:00] so black the would be a free to playay
[01:25:02] option if not you can do something like
[01:25:03] white tassel but if you use white
[01:25:07] tassel yeah it's a little
[01:25:12] cringe five she's better at 140 ER stop
[01:25:16] stop
[01:25:17] it
[01:25:20] stop yes you can go fast yes but if you
[01:25:23] have
[01:25:25] fav okay if you have fav and you play
[01:25:30] Shia it's actually not bad however two
[01:25:34] things
[01:25:36] one well there are two worlds either
[01:25:39] you're like high investment in which
[01:25:40] case if you don't have a better
[01:25:43] option okay let me calm down the odds
[01:25:47] are if you don't have a lot of fav
[01:25:49] lances you would probably rather give it
[01:25:51] to a support like maybe yao yao maybe
[01:25:53] Jang Lee maybe someone you're using and
[01:25:55] then Shia and offensive P but if you
[01:25:57] need the energy on Shia and your
[01:25:59] teammates fav is really good and
[01:26:02] potentially you're I don't even want to
[01:26:04] say best option but it can be no it
[01:26:07] isn't [ __ ] you it's not but it's good
[01:26:09] it's one of the better like as far as
[01:26:11] gotra for go it's really
[01:26:14] good five star weapons are a pretty
[01:26:16] decent upgrade though um and then in his
[01:26:18] like best teams you don't need ER well
[01:26:20] his best team not no plural but the odds
[01:26:23] of you having this team are are a lot
[01:26:25] Slimmer than you having like a a better
[01:26:26] weapon so
[01:26:31] yeah cuz the thing is like lithics
[01:26:33] really good too and Deathmatch is pretty
[01:26:36] cracked and the thing with Death Match
[01:26:38] is like it helps you build him a lot cuz
[01:26:39] you get same with like crit sub stats
[01:26:42] they just
[01:26:46] help but like what if you're like if
[01:26:48] you're like so let's say you're like
[01:26:50] okay like let's say you're free to play
[01:26:51] sh you don't have a lot of weapons and
[01:26:53] you're running like a CZ farzon then
[01:26:55] something like fav is really good cuz it
[01:26:57] helps your sha and it also helps your
[01:26:58] [ __ ] Faron from needing instead of
[01:27:00] needing 368 ER she only need 324 so it's
[01:27:04] pretty uh achievable 324 ER very easy so
[01:27:08] you know
[01:27:14] okay I'm going to do it I'm going to do
[01:27:17] it and you guys are going to get mad at
[01:27:19] me but I'm going to do
[01:27:21] it
[01:27:22] R5 drill yes you can also prospector's
[01:27:26] drill but I swear that weapon isn't real
[01:27:29] like I pulled it I looked at it I was
[01:27:30] like oh this seems pretty good but like
[01:27:32] I feel like no one has it dude okay type
[01:27:36] oh wait this could be a farita
[01:27:41] piece dude type me smile in the chat if
[01:27:44] you have prospector's drill but don't
[01:27:46] lie don't
[01:27:51] lie
[01:27:53] okay that's too many M you do not have
[01:27:55] prospector's
[01:28:00] drill yo T type me smiley face in the
[01:28:03] chat if you have if you have range gauge
[01:28:07] you don't have this weapon don't type me
[01:28:08] smile you nobody has
[01:28:16] this I
[01:28:21] do
[01:28:25] all right let's level the piece we just
[01:28:32] got damn so many followers today thank
[01:28:34] you you know what if you okay I'm going
[01:28:37] to make a z guarantee this is okay okay
[01:28:40] everyone who just followed your next
[01:28:43] artifact Will Roll however this one
[01:28:45] rolls that's a guarantee if this only
[01:28:47] gets flat defense I'm sorry you just got
[01:28:49] [ __ ] if it rolls crit congratul
[01:28:51] ulations but we're in this together we
[01:28:54] are now binded soul and
[01:28:57] blood bound not binded are you [ __ ]
[01:29:00] stupid yeah yeah you
[01:29:04] are first roll
[01:29:07] please well you're [ __ ] no this is
[01:29:10] actually good for first of all 111 it's
[01:29:13] aesthetic second it's good for finina
[01:29:15] who uses golden troop so this is a good
[01:29:17] Fina piece this is a good finina
[01:29:20] piece
[01:29:22] yo I'm so
[01:29:24] sorry I'm actually sorry okay wait one
[01:29:27] more one more one
[01:29:30] more let me
[01:29:35] uh okay okay okay crit damage not bad
[01:29:41] crit damage not
[01:29:43] bad okay one more crit roll is actually
[01:29:46] good like no cope one more crit damage
[01:29:47] is actually good or crit
[01:29:50] rate the not bad not bad only one miss
[01:29:55] HP is good crit is good flat defense
[01:29:58] sucks but not
[01:30:01] bad yeah it's
[01:30:04] good uh the reason why I say not bad
[01:30:07] instead of like really good is because I
[01:30:09] already have this but what's nice is
[01:30:11] like this gives HP so I could give this
[01:30:12] to Fina and then this would go on like
[01:30:14] Navia or uh probably
[01:30:17] official
[01:30:18] yeah why am I keeping these I mean yeah
[01:30:22] I
[01:30:23] guess I don't know but I'll give that to
[01:30:26] my fish uh my finina for
[01:30:29] now shower me with
[01:30:36] praise wait should I give my finina no
[01:30:39] bless yo let me cook for a second should
[01:30:41] I give my finina no bless and then only
[01:30:43] care about my shs damage but I feel like
[01:30:45] at that point bet it's
[01:30:48] better well okay never mind dude dude
[01:30:51] dude I just care about
[01:30:58] Shia but at that point BET's probably a
[01:31:00] better unit I think Frida's only better
[01:31:02] because of her personal damage too I
[01:31:05] think at that point don't use
[01:31:08] VV look milth song do you think I'm
[01:31:12] using
[01:31:13] VV I'm not you're supposed to go VV on
[01:31:16] on Shun in this or farzon in this team
[01:31:19] but I'm
[01:31:20] not
[01:31:29] VV on
[01:31:31] finina what if I go crystallize chow and
[01:31:34] then I pick up the hydr
[01:31:42] Crystal and then you run albo let me
[01:31:46] cook
[01:31:50] chori sorry
[01:31:53] um I should probably level this to nine
[01:31:55] can I okay I can Pro I can craft this
[01:31:58] wait let's actually level to nine I'm a
[01:32:00] I'm a finina enjoyer should probably
[01:32:02] Crown it
[01:32:11] honestly why is he standing on the
[01:32:15] table
[01:32:20] uh
[01:32:36] uh finina Talent boom boom boom all
[01:32:39] right 9 10 good enough for now uh yeah
[01:32:43] this is I don't even have the [ __ ]
[01:32:45] lightless
[01:32:46] Mass it's fine though I'll double crown
[01:32:49] her eventually uh did I Crown net yes I
[01:32:53] did genuine question who's an okay
[01:32:56] replacement if I don't have
[01:32:58] furina did you just say finina I
[01:33:00] couldn't hear the TTS replacement for
[01:33:02] finina in what team sha Bennett Bennett
[01:33:06] is the replacement for any character in
[01:33:08] a Shia team you don't have you don't
[01:33:10] have shenyun play Shia you don't have
[01:33:11] finina play Shia you don't have farzon
[01:33:14] seek employment what sorry no play sugr
[01:33:17] uh sug is fine or shun uh Gan also works
[01:33:20] depends you don't you don't need it
[01:33:22] but yeah benett is usually the
[01:33:30] wait actually that's not true according
[01:33:32] to the one YouTube short we saw the most
[01:33:34] important thing of a shadow team is a
[01:33:35] shield true so actually bench farzon for
[01:33:39] Jong Lee true no Leila
[01:33:43] true what up
[01:33:46] car never
[01:33:48] mind okay let me uh uncap this resin
[01:33:51] this wasn't my fault by the way someone
[01:33:53] someone gave that to us I just can't
[01:33:55] disclose
[01:34:00] who honestly if you don't have finina
[01:34:03] you could probably use
[01:34:05] like you could probably use SRO or like
[01:34:08] yolan let's say SRO yolan and then you
[01:34:10] could replace farzon with like Nita and
[01:34:12] shenyun with kie and then you have a
[01:34:13] pretty good team right there uh that's
[01:34:15] what I would do but it's up to you it's
[01:34:17] up to
[01:34:18] you pretty good team
[01:34:29] the live stre starts in 18
[01:34:32] minutes did it start
[01:34:35] yet no not
[01:34:39] yet I got enemies got a lot of enemies
[01:34:43] you see the G this video on Hy yeah it
[01:34:44] was
[01:34:45] good C1 shun C1 furina C6 f and no
[01:34:52] million do I pull for xia I won't hold
[01:34:55] you
[01:34:56] back that's
[01:34:58] $10 uh what did you just ask uh M
[01:35:05] months sh
[01:35:07] forena okay I have a question I really
[01:35:10] mean no disrespect but why why would you
[01:35:14] like I'm not encouraging pulling for
[01:35:16] constellations but if you're going to
[01:35:18] why would you stop at the terrible one
[01:35:19] instead of getting the good one for not
[01:35:21] one character but but but but but but
[01:35:23] two
[01:35:26] characters I mean this
[01:35:30] isn't exploration base true actually
[01:35:34] it's not bad they're not bad it's just
[01:35:36] like C2 is so big see1 finina is good
[01:35:39] see1 finina is it's okay sure it's good
[01:35:43] but like this is so good with Shia C ver
[01:35:46] is so good with
[01:35:50] Shia
[01:35:52] but yeah this is fine it helps you scale
[01:35:55] up uh faster and you also get more
[01:35:58] so yeah what if I don't have sh it's not
[01:36:01] bad can I go Ben
[01:36:12] it here's the everybody
[01:36:17] stand make way for the disappear
[01:36:27] for 10 dude why these guys not
[01:36:29] groups this taking way longer than it
[01:36:32] should luci's donated $10 ruined my
[01:36:37] sleep schedule for this but it's okay
[01:36:39] because it's
[01:36:42] z0x wait is
[01:36:50] it
[01:37:15] all
[01:37:16] right was this
[01:37:20] unlucky
[01:37:27] you think that's the best constellation
[01:37:29] in the game don't talk to
[01:37:32] me I'm a I'm a Nita C2
[01:37:39] enjoyer
[01:37:41] worthless Shang Ling C4 true actually
[01:37:45] Shang Ling C4
[01:37:48] true um wait wait a second
[01:38:05] yeah yeah yeah 25% that's all
[01:38:17] right my point is more so there's some
[01:38:20] characters where I don't see the point
[01:38:21] of getting C1 unless you want to get
[01:38:24] C2 I don't think Fin's necessarily one
[01:38:26] of them but he
[01:38:29] sock like shenyun C1 and finina C1 if
[01:38:32] you choose one of the two to get C2 for
[01:38:34] your sh which is I think what you're
[01:38:35] building would be a lot more beneficial
[01:38:37] than like one
[01:38:39] one but obviously like gotcha is gotcha
[01:38:43] so you can't really choose everybody
[01:38:46] stand
[01:38:50] disappear
[01:38:54] C2 with key competes yeah fin C2 is
[01:38:56] really good I like I'm not
[01:39:00] yeah finina cons also makes her better
[01:39:02] with uh Shia especially pre- shenyun
[01:39:05] well even post chanun but just because
[01:39:07] it's like let's say you're playing
[01:39:09] Bennett it's like pretty hard to heal
[01:39:12] enough uh alone but shenyun kind of
[01:39:14] changes
[01:39:16] that anyways let me go
[01:39:20] kets
[01:39:21] I didn't sleep last night chat so I'm a
[01:39:23] little uh I'm a
[01:39:27] little delayed I'm I'm on high ping
[01:39:30] right
[01:39:37] now T goblet Child free T goet child's
[01:39:40] good it just it just depends like uh
[01:39:43] shenyun makes it worse finina farzon
[01:39:46] make it better uh Mar makes it better
[01:39:49] Vermillion makes it worse so like it
[01:39:51] depends it's not bad though like it can
[01:39:53] be better depending on your subat and
[01:39:55] teams yeah I would use the optimizer for
[01:40:00] that still on geog goblet no I'm
[01:40:03] not I change
[01:40:06] it still on iron point though

[01:46:40] whoopsy
[01:46:47] daisies floor
[01:46:49] eight
[01:46:51] how do I link my account to get drops uh
[01:46:54] usually you have to do that through
[01:46:56] twitch for the live stream and they just
[01:46:57] give codes so yeah you're going to get
[01:47:00] 300 Primo gems you can link it on H labr
[01:47:02] I don't know I don't do that I usually
[01:47:04] uh copy paste it in my game but I forget
[01:47:06] to do it and then I lose out on 300
[01:47:09] Primos but I know there's a way to
[01:47:10] automatically redeem it I should
[01:47:13] probably figure it out do you see Jake's
[01:47:16] Tik Tok I do not use that app I will
[01:47:18] though actually okay I have a Tik Tok
[01:47:22] but it's like [ __ ] so I'm making a new
[01:47:24] one because the Tik Tok support team is
[01:47:26] a bunch of no sorry I don't know them
[01:47:27] they might be good people I'm not going
[01:47:28] to Flame them however they're not
[01:47:30] responding so I have to make a new one
[01:47:32] is what it is though well I don't have
[01:47:34] to
[01:47:45] but so
[01:47:49] bad
[01:47:55] less social media a w yeah but it's not
[01:47:57] me using it we're just like Po like I'm
[01:47:59] making shorts anyways so why would I not
[01:48:01] put them there is my like cuz Allan's
[01:48:03] going to be managing it and it's like
[01:48:05] why would
[01:48:07] I essentially if it does well I can pay
[01:48:10] him more is my logic like you're not
[01:48:12] going to make money on Tik Tok so it's
[01:48:14] like whatever I do well I mean we'll see
[01:48:18] it's just like wasted uh content if not
[01:48:21] is my
[01:48:22] logic I don't need to actually use
[01:48:26] it what the [ __ ] is
[01:48:28] aboba it's a
[01:48:35] boba I mean you guys know I [ __ ] hate
[01:48:37] Twitter but I'm also like I I use
[01:48:40] Twitter but dude my phone's been
[01:48:41] overheating so I haven't had a phone for
[01:48:42] like 5 days so I haven't been using it
[01:48:44] my life's actually been better but I
[01:48:46] just
[01:48:47] like I don't know I I try to stay in my
[01:48:50] own bubble I just I post and then I
[01:48:52] closed
[01:48:55] out you're addicted I'm actually not I
[01:48:58] literally don't even
[01:49:00] like I don't even use it that
[01:49:05] much look FB 28 FB 26 FB 25 23 I don't
[01:49:11] even use that much 22 22 21 19
[01:49:17] 18 okay a lot of 18 1
[01:49:30] no I don't use
[01:49:32] Instagram that's daily usage dude what
[01:49:35] do you want for
[01:49:39] me I don't know I like you guys not
[01:49:43] parasocial like I feel like you okay
[01:49:46] some communities are really
[01:49:48] funny and
[01:49:51] so my replies are funny and
[01:49:55] sometimes I I I you know I see tweets
[01:49:58] that make me laugh but other times it's
[01:49:59] just depression like actually so I I try
[01:50:02] not to use it too
[01:50:09] much like by I have scroll I have Doom
[01:50:13] scrolled basically every app and none of
[01:50:16] them have ruined my day more than
[01:50:17] Twitter but it's also sometimes you know
[01:50:19] made me
[01:50:27] happy why you being normal dude I
[01:50:29] haven't slept I didn't sleep and I'm
[01:50:32] waiting for chy I have two exams next
[01:50:38] week yeah Tik Tok and YouTube shorts are
[01:50:41] entertaining but the the and I I I mean
[01:50:43] I make them I I but sometimes I feel
[01:50:46] like once you start scrolling you can't
[01:50:48] stop and then it's like it becomes brain
[01:50:50] Rod like I I get I know this is
[01:50:53] hypocritical coming from a brain Roder
[01:50:55] however and it's it's entertaining but I
[01:50:57] just like so the first few are
[01:50:58] entertaining but after that you're in
[01:51:00] this like Loop where it's like you don't
[01:51:02] you're not even like conscious anymore
[01:51:04] it's like what am I I don't even know
[01:51:06] what I'm watching it's like I can't stop
[01:51:08] but I don't I'm not I don't know if I'm
[01:51:09] enjoying it or
[01:51:11] not and then like you feel your brain
[01:51:14] cells blowing

[01:54:50] don't know no porn acting for real
[01:54:52] because I actually have seen nothing
[01:54:54] about chiori cuz I I gota just don't
[01:54:57] care I mean I actively try not to look
[01:55:00] so I haven't seen anything so actually
[01:55:02] all her animations everything I have not
[01:55:04] seen I don't know what the [ __ ] she does
[01:55:06] no capping I just finished the sparkle
[01:55:09] guide so I haven't had time to care well
[01:55:12] okay I wouldn't check anyways because I
[01:55:14] don't check sometimes I do I'm not going
[01:55:17] to lie but I usually don't
[01:55:30] you should tweet dead Pat nope I'm not
[01:55:32] tweeting okay I might but not that
[01:55:34] Travelers that everyone's Keen to hear
[01:55:36] more about the new version tell it then
[01:55:40] unsurprisingly our first bit of
[01:55:42] information relates to our newest
[01:55:44] character chiori woo huh it's just a
[01:55:47] piece of fabric huh why was it in the
[01:55:49] Box wo it's actually really beautiful a
[01:55:52] professional designer like giori is very
[01:55:55] strict about her materials she probably
[01:55:58] uses unique Fabrics pretty frequently oh
[01:56:00] yeah I'm a designer too that makes a lot
[01:56:02] of sense yeah I thought that really
[01:56:05] strong impression at the falia film
[01:56:07] festival yeah definitely you could get a
[01:56:10] really good read on her based on how she
[01:56:11] dresses and the way that she talks o I
[01:56:13] agree she seemed firm and decisive like
[01:56:16] the kind of person who always says
[01:56:18] exactly what she means M I also get the
[01:56:20] impression that she's not afraid of
[01:56:22] going after what she wants yeah it must
[01:56:24] have taken a lot of effort for an Ena
[01:56:26] zooman to become so successful in the
[01:56:28] Fontaine fashion industry yes I bet her
[01:56:31] success was based on a lot of skill and
[01:56:33] talent mhm you know it you all seem
[01:56:36] pretty familiar with giori already but
[01:56:38] you might not be aware about her combat
[01:56:40] abilities so I'm not please show them
[01:56:43] appreciate her fighting style let's
[01:56:47] fighting it's up to me me to decide who
[01:56:50] I want to be and to wait do you have a
[01:56:52] puppet please no one can tell me what
[01:56:54] never mind I just got
[01:57:01] baited okay hilly TR didn't die from
[01:57:06] that oh she does have a puppet
[01:57:09] thing okay that's cool I Am The Cutting
[01:57:11] Edge of
[01:57:14] fashion that's not bad either puppet's
[01:57:17] the best part oh my God oh she so
[01:57:21] cool that felt short I guess they're
[01:57:23] always like that it is a puppet Cut
[01:57:25] Above the
[01:57:27] Rest yeah and I love her animations
[01:57:30] they're so Sleek yes yeah super stylish
[01:57:33] major sty the skill it's like a Geo Alo
[01:57:37] I'm to add them to my own collection
[01:57:38] it's like if we got you see that during
[01:57:40] her burst she actually crosses them over
[01:57:42] to look like scissors yes yeah I didn't
[01:57:44] even notice that that's cool notice that
[01:57:46] good catch yeah observers often consider
[01:57:49] consider giori to be an unconventional
[01:57:52] designer she has a unique way of
[01:57:54] Designing her clothes aside from using
[01:57:57] her own to cut fabric that's skills on
[01:58:00] attack and defense oh no her long time
[01:58:03] personal oh no it's probably it's
[01:58:05] probably like Al then I guess tooto is
[01:58:09] indispensable to how chori expresses her
[01:58:11] unique Creative Vision to the world it's
[01:58:14] like she has an aura that proclaims to
[01:58:16] Everyone Active GE conct IS F
[01:58:21] okay the bright side is J's found an
[01:58:24] ingenious way I can talk over this the
[01:58:27] bright side is tooto doesn't look like a
[01:58:28] geoc construct but it depends on geoc
[01:58:31] construct which means geoc constructs
[01:58:32] are [ __ ] stupid cuz any enemy coughs
[01:58:34] on them and they break you plays wrly
[01:58:36] [ __ ] dog the wolf Lord walks into it
[01:58:38] his dead but wait wait tomoto it doesn't
[01:58:42] look like that it's not a c I don't
[01:58:43] think so that's cool maybe she could
[01:58:45] expand into a new industry if she wanted
[01:58:47] but it needs one
[01:58:50] ski can adjust the direction of her Dash
[01:58:52] to attack enemies from multiple angles
[01:58:55] and as an experienced
[01:58:57] business knows does it leave does the
[01:58:59] second one leave if the pillar breaks I
[01:59:00] wonder will summon an additional
[01:59:02] automaton when tooto is active and there
[01:59:04] are other geoc constructs on the it's
[01:59:06] summon so I guess not unlocking why
[01:59:08] would un specific talents chori can
[01:59:10] trigger special effects when using her
[01:59:12] skill or normal attack during the upward
[01:59:14] strike on her El is that a [ __ ] clo
[01:59:15] hanger interesting so it seems like you
[01:59:18] can even switch your
[01:59:19] [Music]
[01:59:21] uhuh her little assistant a lot of
[01:59:24] trouble oh absolutely JY doesn't like to
[01:59:26] waste her time on um trivial matters if
[01:59:30] someone tests plle with a stri oh
[01:59:34] infusion never mind [ __ ]
[01:59:36] it she already may be a professional Des
[01:59:39] I'm also really fun to watch in combat
[01:59:42] the normal ATT will cause to gain GE
[01:59:44] infusion is it to anyone or just her
[01:59:46] though it also needs to serve a
[01:59:47] functional purpose when when chiori is
[01:59:49] in your active party and any of your
[01:59:52] characters are wearing a unique outfit
[01:59:54] or a non-default wing glider can I play
[01:59:58] movement speed increas maybe it's just
[01:59:59] for her no it's probably just for her
[02:00:01] and true designer but imagine travel
[02:00:02] will definitely be smoother when she's
[02:00:04] in the party it's probably just for
[02:00:06] her well maybe not ji tends to run into
[02:00:11] a lot of trouble it might be because of
[02:00:14] her blunt personality but unexpected
[02:00:17] problems often arise no matter how much
[02:00:19] she tries to avoid and passive did I
[02:00:21] miss it I'm sure that a straightforward
[02:00:23] person like chori has her own methods of
[02:00:26] getting herself out of those situations
[02:00:28] quickly it's possible chei is an
[02:00:33] unconventional designer with a Clear
[02:00:35] Vision she isn't afraid to go after what
[02:00:37] she wants and that approach has made her
[02:00:40] very successful chori will do anything
[02:00:43] to make sure the choria brand becomes
[02:00:45] renowned throughout all of toat so she's
[02:00:48] always looking for ways to increase its
[02:00:50] exposure such as participating in
[02:00:53] Fontaine Fashion Week ooh I bet she
[02:00:56] probably has to go all out on Fashion
[02:00:58] Week chori's story Quest the sesor
[02:01:01] chapter will become available in version
[02:01:03] 4.5 oh like like scissors compor as she
[02:01:06] confronts unexpected wait never mind
[02:01:08] Elon made that a slur you can't say that
[02:01:10] you can't you can't I'm sorry we'll have
[02:01:13] to wait and see you get limited on twit
[02:01:15] sure that Kirara will be there to help
[02:01:17] chori being her good friend and all
[02:01:19] oh I can't wait to see what kind of
[02:01:21] interactions they'll have I should
[02:01:24] mention that shiori also designed karo's
[02:01:27] outfit oh so Kirara is one of ch's
[02:01:30] clients if you want to learn more about
[02:01:33] Chi then be sure to check out her story
[02:01:35] Quest when it becomes available that's
[02:01:37] cool scissors Travelers won't just be

[02:01:41] also be available in version 4.5 after
[02:01:44] Travelers complete her Quest they'll
[02:01:45] receive a special reward the fomer ooh
[02:01:49] awesome oh this a pretty interesting
[02:01:52] tool you can draw a random number from a
[02:01:54] hat when you interact with the phmeter
[02:01:56] and then you get resin based on the
[02:01:58] number on a decision they can use the
[02:02:00] phmeter as an interesting solution oo
[02:02:02] yeah if you're farming for artifacts or
[02:02:04] enhancement materials in co-op mode you
[02:02:07] might run into a situation where
[02:02:08] multiple people want to use the same
[02:02:10] character but you can decide a winner by
[02:02:13] drawing a random number with the okay
[02:02:15] I'm done it's literally gamb you can
[02:02:18] roll
[02:02:19] if you're as easily I'm going to use the
[02:02:21] [ __ ] out of that though I
[02:02:22] am if you have a lot of content to
[02:02:25] explore then you can even use the
[02:02:27] phmeter to decide where you should start
[02:02:29] yeah we're definitely using that every
[02:02:30] day back and forth yeah how about we try
[02:02:33] the phatom that's useless but it's
[02:02:34] content so o me
[02:02:37] first wait have we decided what the
[02:02:39] numbers mean oh uh how about this then
[02:02:43] whoever draws the largest number gets to
[02:02:46] introduce the next piece of information
[02:02:48] ooh okay though I think I'll be sitting
[02:02:50] this one out I already got to introd
[02:02:52] okay anything higher than a one and I'll
[02:02:54] do Vermillion roll again I'll
[02:02:56] go
[02:02:58] okay that's okay I guess I'm not doing

[02:03:32] loveo I sure hope we don't get this in
[02:03:35] the
[02:03:36] abyss so it's not just a good weapon for
[02:03:38] chiori might also work for albo that's
[02:03:42] something that Travelers will have to
[02:03:44] try out for themselves nervet and Kell
[02:03:46] will also oh my God that's so
[02:03:49] all right
[02:03:51] well sorry first half I'm sorry it looks
[02:03:55] like we also have information about a
[02:03:57] new wish the chronicled
[02:04:01] wish what's that yeah let me explain a
[02:04:05] new type of banner will be available
[02:04:07] starting from version 4.5 the chronicled
[02:04:10] wish the chronicled wish Banner will
[02:04:13] allow travelers to obtain a variety of
[02:04:15] characters such as CLE and D they'll
[02:04:18] also be able to obtain weapons such as
[02:04:20] Hunter's path and and Beacon wait I've
[02:04:23] actually been saying about wow I've been
[02:04:25] saying they should do this for like a
[02:04:26] year wait if so many characters and
[02:04:29] weapons are going to be on the same
[02:04:31] Banner all these can be chosen as kind
[02:04:32] of hard to pull for exactly please be
[02:04:34] good please don't scam us please be good
[02:04:36] nope you can chart a specific course for
[02:04:38] the character or weapon that you want
[02:04:41] plus it only takes a maximum of one fate
[02:04:43] point to guarantee your target you're
[02:04:45] also guaranteed an item that matches
[02:04:47] your target type
[02:04:49] for example if you're targeting a
[02:04:51] specific five-star character whatever
[02:04:53] you end up pulling is guaranteed to be a
[02:04:55] character the same is true for weapon
[02:04:58] poles okay that's actually seems like a
[02:05:00] great opportunity for travelers out on
[02:05:03] certain characters that's actually
[02:05:04] pretty F and I've been saying some
[02:05:07] characters I don't like need a full
[02:05:09] rerun but should be there will only
[02:05:11] feature festar characters that have had
[02:05:13] at least three character event wishes
[02:05:15] and have not appeared on any recent
[02:05:18] banners H more details about the
[02:05:21] chronicled wish banners will be revealed
[02:05:23] in an official announc be sure to keep
[02:05:25] an eye out if you're interested in them
[02:05:27] also version 4.5 will introduce a
[02:05:29] training guide system to make it easier
[02:05:31] for new travelers to explore to vet
[02:05:33] we'll provide more details later on in
[02:05:35] the program okay cuz like someone like C
[02:05:38] if you're a CLE man you deserve to pull
[02:05:40] for Cle at some point but does she
[02:05:41] deserve a full rerun for like 3 weeks
[02:05:44] this is so good for that assuming I
[02:05:47] understand it correctly maybe there's
[02:05:48] like a fine print where like you get
[02:05:49] [ __ ] if you I don't know click the
[02:05:51] wrong button but that seems pretty POG
[02:05:53] and de's weapon and tan Ari's weapon oh
[02:05:57] my
[02:06:01] God this is not a
[02:06:03] drill we are
[02:06:07] [Applause]
[02:06:17] getting
[02:06:20] [Music]
[02:06:22] he who
[02:06:43] tweets all right sorry I was yapping uh
[02:06:46] de's weapon and tar weapon are actually
[02:06:49] really good by the way Beacon of the REI
[02:06:50] is insane so in case you're wondering
[02:06:52] I'm very excited for that we can talk
[02:06:54] more about it after to the next bit of
[02:06:56] content let me see here a
[02:07:01] bottle judging from the shape of the
[02:07:04] glass and the color of the liquid I'm
[02:07:06] guessing that the bottle has something
[02:07:07] to do with Alchemy oh and judging from
[02:07:10] our surroundings maybe oh no Dory [ __ ]
[02:07:14] please
[02:07:15] no next we're introducing an event that
[02:07:18] takes
[02:07:19] it's an Alchemy event as the city of
[02:07:21] monat continues to develop its leaders
[02:07:23] are busy with planning for its future
[02:07:26] the kns of fonus have always been
[02:07:27] conducting Alchemy research and they've
[02:07:29] been looking for a way to Showcase their
[02:07:31] results Lisa came up with the idea to
[02:07:33] open a potion shop the people of monat
[02:07:36] can learn more about alchemy and the
[02:07:37] Knights can better understand their
[02:07:39] needs everybody wins it's it's literally
[02:07:41] a staff exciting yeah definitely
[02:07:44] especially since Travelers will get to
[02:07:46] run the potion shop during this event oh
[02:07:49] and what'll that look like in the
[02:07:51] alchemical Ascension event Travelers
[02:07:53] will need to cultivate herbs brew
[02:07:55] potions and sell their products to
[02:07:56] increase the Shop's revenue and expand
[02:07:58] their business so it's a management Sim
[02:08:01] oo I love that yeah exactly Travelers
[02:08:04] who build up the revenue and run the
[02:08:05] shop smoothly will be able to earn
[02:08:07] various rewards he gems and a fourstar
[02:08:11] pole arm dialogues of desert sages
[02:08:15] nice Travelers can also look forward to
[02:08:18] familiar companions at the shop you
[02:08:20] Travelers can scale their business even
[02:08:22] faster if they fulfill these special
[02:08:23] customers requirements oh sounds pretty
[02:08:27] neat I'm hyped yeah me too that's all I
[02:08:31] have to announce about this event what's
[02:08:33] the next bit of
[02:08:39] news I feel like we don't even need to
[02:08:42] introduce this one everyone can
[02:08:44] understand that our upcoming content is
[02:08:46] about cats it's like I've returned
[02:08:50] home cat Julie has already gotten into
[02:08:53] character hey wait wait a second sucros
[02:08:56] also has animal ears right well she
[02:09:00] doesn't have a tail though oh so sirose
[02:09:03] isn't Park cat no comment wait really
[02:09:05] she's
[02:09:07] not we've completely gone off to I have
[02:09:10] cat ears tooing the most important the
[02:09:13] feline Fortress fery The Traveler and
[02:09:16] Pimon have encountered all all sorts of
[02:09:18] strange creatures during their Journey
[02:09:20] I'm going to say it but this is what
[02:09:22] genin looks like to nonin players to
[02:09:24] visit the familiar ctail ah that makes
[02:09:28] sense since they've been on the road for
[02:09:29] so long there's no better way to relieve
[02:09:32] your fatigue than spending time with
[02:09:33] some cuddly cats cat lovers of tat fine
[02:09:38] Fortress for for this EV doesn't
[02:09:42] actually take place cat a kind-hearted
[02:09:45] person recently prepared a new space for
[02:09:47] the cats to play to their hearts content
[02:09:49] Travelers simply need to set up fluffy
[02:09:51] feline homes for the cats satisfy
[02:09:53] specific Target requirements and provide
[02:09:56] the cats with their favorite food I'm
[02:09:58] done only then will Travelers be able to
[02:10:00] play with their furry friends at the
[02:10:02] Throne of
[02:10:03] meow playing with cats can be a little
[02:10:06] oh my God you can pet the [ __ ] cat
[02:10:07] angry if you do something that makes
[02:10:08] them uncomfortable okay never mind this
[02:10:10] event's good once Travelers have become
[02:10:12] good friends all of the cat is that the
[02:10:14] first time in 3 years a special friend
[02:10:17] yep you can bet the
[02:10:18] make it per very good friend to the cats
[02:10:21] hey you know what all this cat talk
[02:10:23] reminds me
[02:10:24] of into bat they're pretty closely
[02:10:27] associated right I can definitely see
[02:10:30] Travelers returning to the cat's tail to
[02:10:32] play some genius invocation TCG after
[02:10:34] playing with all those cats play with
[02:10:36] the cats chat stop typing B the the two
[02:10:39] TCG players left might be in chat have
[02:10:41] some respect suddenly I feel like there
[02:10:44] hours in the day you might be in trouble
[02:10:47] then ver 4.5 is adding even more new
[02:10:50] cards events and challenges to genius
[02:10:52] invocation TCG for all travelers aside
[02:10:55] from playing with cats and engaging in
[02:10:57] card games the developers also prepared
[02:11:00] some challenges that will give Travelers
[02:11:01] the opportunity to show up their skills
[02:11:04] in version 4.5 Travelers will meet two
[02:11:07] guard members in Fontaine one of them is
[02:11:10] a genius inventor who rejected an
[02:11:12] invitation from the Fontaine Research
[02:11:14] Institute three times wow sure seems
[02:11:19] like there are a lot of geniuses in
[02:11:20] Fontaine I wonder that place has so many
[02:11:22] cool inventions this genius inventor
[02:11:25] will lend The Traveler a remote cannon
[02:11:27] that he invented to take down a fearsome
[02:11:30] hilly chural Rogue uh I meant that the
[02:11:33] cannon will be used to take down slimes
[02:11:35] oh that's cool too this game kind of
[02:11:38] reminds me of the marbles that we would
[02:11:39] play with when we were younger oh yeah
[02:11:41] yeah totally so in this event Travelers
[02:11:45] will remotely operate a turret to fire
[02:11:47] Elemental shell and an endless hord of
[02:11:50] slimes try to defeat as many slimes as
[02:11:52] you can by triggering Elemental okay not
[02:11:54] to sound like Peta right now but what
[02:11:56] these slimes do to you rewards that you
[02:11:57] can
[02:11:59] obtain yes reward delicious special
[02:12:02] equipment will also I'm starting to I
[02:12:04] think we're the bad guy in genin let you
[02:12:05] even more points sweet maybe the other
[02:12:08] twin was right involves a mysterious
[02:12:10] concoction called the pH potion oh
[02:12:13] that's something thaty developed right
[02:12:16] if I remember correctly I love face CL
[02:12:18] from
[02:12:19] the didn't the traveler participate in a
[02:12:21] bunch of experiments to help him with
[02:12:22] his thesis yep he's made some
[02:12:25] improvements since then and he's waiting
[02:12:27] for someone to test him
[02:12:29] out in previous challenges you had to
[02:12:32] wait for the potion to take wait no way
[02:12:33] they're playing hyper Travelers will
[02:12:35] automatically enter time dation mode
[02:12:38] when you enter the Challenger you can
[02:12:40] even take pictures when this mode is
[02:12:42] active mhm time will resume when you
[02:12:45] move or use any type of skill you'll
[02:12:47] enter time time dilation mode again once
[02:12:49] you stop moving or using your skills mhm
[02:12:52] yep time will stop as long as you don't
[02:12:54] move after unleashing a skill it's
[02:12:56] pretty sweet right I'm sure that
[02:12:58] Travelers will be able to take tons of
[02:13:00] cool pictures of their characters yeah
[02:13:02] absolutely Travelers will also need to
[02:13:04] focus on accumulating phase force during
[02:13:06] combat once you have enough of it you'll
[02:13:09] be given an advantage that will help you
[02:13:10] complete the challenge awesome also the
[02:13:13] layline Overflow vent will be returning
[02:13:15] in version 4.5 so miss out you guys oh L
[02:13:19] overflow okay we take those finished
[02:13:21] introducing all best part of the version
[02:13:24] 4.5 uh next up we have wait a second
[02:13:29] we've just announced a lot of
[02:13:30] information don't you think that's true
[02:13:32] let's take a short break and look at the
[02:13:34] last redemption code before we continue
[02:13:36] wait last that's a good idea then we'll
[02:13:38] see everyone on the I swear this just
[02:13:39] started byebye where's AR Lino oh cat
[02:13:44] let me move my face cam oh [ __ ] I'm gone
[02:13:47] I'm back
[02:13:53] [Music]
[02:13:55] hello
[02:13:57] sorry can you leave again okay sorry for
[02:14:03] talking uh that Banner is actually I'm
[02:14:06] actually hyped for that Banner what the
[02:14:08] [ __ ] like I heard rumors but I did not
[02:14:11] expect that what the [ __ ] wait so okay
[02:14:14] so it's 50 if you lose Okay so you pick
[02:14:19] you choose something to chart for and if
[02:14:21] you lose it's a
[02:14:22] 50/50 if and then the second one is
[02:14:24] guaranteed and if you lose the first one
[02:14:26] you get a character or weapon whatever
[02:14:28] you chose
[02:14:31] right it just depends okay the what it
[02:14:34] depends on is what type of wishes it
[02:14:35] uses I assume it's the [ __ ]
[02:14:36] intertwined ones cuz they want money
[02:14:40] um but still welcome back that could be
[02:14:43] in addition to the new events in version
[02:14:45] 4.5 the developers also plan and a few
[02:14:48] system optimizations let's take a look
[02:14:51] yeah version 4.5 Travelers will be able
[02:14:54] to view a character's Talent upgrade
[02:14:56] materials on the character Talent
[02:14:57] interface menu yeah that's cool
[02:14:59] hopefully everyone understand what
[02:15:01] materials they need in order to improve
[02:15:03] a character skills remember the new
[02:15:05] training guide that we mentioned earlier
[02:15:08] that's also a new verion 4. but like no
[02:15:12] this adventure rank 12 or higher and
[02:15:14] completed the quest Welcome to the
[02:15:16] adventur able to refer to this I don't
[02:15:19] trust what the P the common option is
[02:15:21] cuz a lot of times it's sometimes it's
[02:15:23] wrong en goals and suggestions based on
[02:15:26] the levels weapons artifacts and talents
[02:15:29] of your characters it also takes your
[02:15:31] maximum World level into account
[02:15:33] hopefully this guy your job is done
[02:15:36] started their journey into that
[02:15:37] prototype Ron or designed as a helpful
[02:15:39] resource for travelers who are
[02:15:41] relatively new to to that there's so
[02:15:43] much to discover in genin Impact I'm
[02:15:46] sure that Travelers will eventually f
[02:15:47] figure out the best system for them
[02:15:49] where's my face cam I'm sorry exploring
[02:15:51] all those possibilities Why did no one
[02:15:52] say anything did you guys so far we've
[02:15:55] just been
[02:15:56] covering what the [ __ ] but we also have
[02:15:59] some external news to share during
[02:16:01] version 4.5 genin impact will be teaming
[02:16:04] up with the Discovery Channel to launch
[02:16:05] benef discover Chanel Environmental
[02:16:08] Conservation genin characters will serve
[02:16:11] as ambassadors for specific natural
[02:16:12] landscapes and they'll be embarking on a
[02:16:14] journey with all the Travelers out there
[02:16:16] so suris such a cool collaboration
[02:16:20] Inc during version 4.5 Travelers can
[02:16:24] also look what's going to happen
[02:16:25] Discovery Channel or anime first OST
[02:16:27] album Jade rolence the album will be
[02:16:30] comprised of two discs which feature
[02:16:33] over 50 tracks by the hoyo mix team it
[02:16:36] will contain music from version
[02:16:38] 4.4 I think the music look pretty good
[02:16:40] this patch featured I always think it's
[02:16:42] good and story but we take that more
[02:16:46] music is good
[02:16:48] all right seems like we've delivered all
[02:16:51] of the information why she winking at me
[02:16:52] wait does that mean that we've come to
[02:16:54] the end of the special program oh
[02:16:57] already so fast but wait a special
[02:17:00] trailer anyone else super excited for
[02:17:02] the Cat Cafe special OB immediately 100%
[02:17:07] 11% I'm also really excited for everyone
[02:17:10] special I mean like they met her but I
[02:17:13] want them to like meet her like get to
[02:17:16] know her see her cool sword scissor
[02:17:20] attack a
[02:17:22] special I mean I'm a little biased but
[02:17:24] you know I mean I think that's it's she
[02:17:27] over I will probably end up spending a
[02:17:30] lot of time on the rolling Crossfire
[02:17:32] event too uh yes if they show our Lino
[02:17:35] 50 gift destroy those slimes destroy the
[02:17:38] slimes will and I just roll with it then
[02:17:41] huh I had to I had
[02:17:43] to that's so good bye
[02:17:46] everyone
[02:17:48] thanks for coming guys Oh but before you
[02:17:51] leave a special announcement D way comes
[02:17:53] on screen hey guys look at the
[02:17:57] oh oh [ __ ] I mean that's what it
[02:18:04] is that was
[02:18:06] short 35 minutes is that normal feel
[02:18:10] like that was
[02:18:12] short um I assume this is because
[02:18:14] they're waiting for 4.6 to release
[02:18:16] chlorin AR Lino Andor is going to be
[02:18:19] three that's why
[02:18:26] um
[02:18:30] however this I'm going to be
[02:18:33] honest I'm going to be honest honest
[02:18:35] take right now chori looks cool outside
[02:18:38] of that filler event patch but I'm kind
[02:18:42] of hyped about this am I am I pre
[02:18:44] prematurely hyping this i h i was hyped
[02:18:46] when I heard G uh presets and then I
[02:18:48] realized they weren't actually presets
[02:18:50] and it was just poop but this looks cool
[02:18:53] I just still if you have to use event
[02:18:55] wishes on
[02:18:56] this um which I assume you do because it
[02:18:59] says event
[02:19:02] wish I mean no it's still
[02:19:06] like it's basically cu the thing is okay
[02:19:09] this is what it is for me a lot of
[02:19:11] people like let's say you're like okay
[02:19:12] I'm saving for Ula rerun let's say
[02:19:14] you're the like the people that keep
[02:19:15] complaining that albo hasn't got a rerun
[02:19:17] like patches where's albo where's albo
[02:19:19] if he gets a rerun he's going to sell as
[02:19:21] much as [ __ ] burnt toast okay I love
[02:19:23] albo no disrespect but the odds of like
[02:19:26] the amount of people that are going to
[02:19:27] pull from probably not worth a full
[02:19:29] rerun which is why having like a banner
[02:19:31] that's basically a rerun right because I
[02:19:33] don't know what four stars are going to
[02:19:34] be on it it's probably just everyone so
[02:19:36] it's maybe a bit worse maybe a bit
[02:19:38] better it's effectively going to be the
[02:19:40] same question mark it might be different
[02:19:43] pity or something however it is a 50/50
[02:19:46] where you either get the character you
[02:19:48] get it next one right and if you lose
[02:19:50] you're guaranteed a character so it's
[02:19:52] it's realistically for someone who wants
[02:19:54] albo or YULA or CLE it's the same as if
[02:19:57] they got a rerun unless I misunderstand
[02:20:02] it outside of that though the weapon
[02:20:06] things uh you're if you want like a
[02:20:08] standard weapon you're kind of coping
[02:20:10] Jade spear is not here which is [ __ ]
[02:20:12] funny uh that's actually weird why is
[02:20:15] Jade spear not here what the [ __ ]
[02:20:20] huh what I mean I guess cuz they want to
[02:20:24] sell for Jade for Shia but what the [ __ ]
[02:20:27] Amos where no you better [ __ ] be
[02:20:29] thankful Amos isn't here dude if you try
[02:20:32] to get Hunter's path and you get Amos
[02:20:34] I'm I'm I'm done I'm uninstalling I'm
[02:20:39] sorry [ __ ]
[02:20:42] Amos I mean it's okay but actually no
[02:20:44] it's not but it's okay for G you uh
[02:20:49] yeah song of broken I mean so song
[02:20:52] Beacon Hunter's path are the three that
[02:20:55] aren't on
[02:20:58] standard Jade was recently than a weapon
[02:21:00] Banner yeah I mean I assume that's why
[02:21:03] yeah makes
[02:21:04] sense same with
[02:21:14] Amos anyways Beacon of the REI is
[02:21:16] genuinely really good uh I think it's du
[02:21:18] Luke's best in slot A lot of the times
[02:21:21] and uh Hunter's path is also pretty
[02:21:26] good or very good
[02:21:29] rather so yeah um it's not like I don't
[02:21:32] recommend assuming this is the same
[02:21:34] currency as regular wishes like sorry
[02:21:37] assuming it's the same currency as event
[02:21:39] wishes which is the worst case scenario
[02:21:40] but I assume it's that that's why they
[02:21:41] put event then I don't recommend like
[02:21:44] let's say you're like okay how should I
[02:21:45] spend my Primo gems I don't recommend
[02:21:46] pulling on this this but if you're
[02:21:48] someone who wants Ula or albo or CLE or
[02:21:51] de weapon which is good or big teas
[02:21:53] weapon which is also good then yeah it's
[02:21:57] it's as if you always have an albo rerun
[02:21:59] or a clear rerun or a UL rerun or the
[02:22:01] those weapons so that's not
[02:22:10] bad worst case is a whole new currency
[02:22:13] true actually unless they give it like
[02:22:15] unless there's a way to get it
[02:22:17] yeah that would be I mean would it even
[02:22:21] they all come from Primo gems I guess it
[02:22:23] would be because like
[02:22:26] separate I don't know it depends how
[02:22:28] they do it if they give like some free
[02:22:29] ones like in the shop and [ __ ] then more
[02:22:32] free stuff would be better but it would
[02:22:34] be annoying because then everything's
[02:22:36] like different different pity different
[02:22:37] that I assume the pity is going to be
[02:22:42] different I don't think it's going to be
[02:22:44] yeah I don't think it's going to be I
[02:22:46] think it's going to be event currency I
[02:22:47] think the reason they put event there is
[02:22:49] so that they can justify making it event
[02:22:51] currency that is my guess I don't
[02:22:54] [ __ ] know but that's my
[02:22:58] guess and they also said the banners
[02:23:01] like this is for people for characters
[02:23:03] that don't get a rerun for haven't got a
[02:23:05] rerun for a while so maybe they'll like
[02:23:07] update it like maybe this lasts a
[02:23:09] certain amount of time and then after
[02:23:11] it'll be
[02:23:14] like like I don't know like some other
[02:23:16] character
[02:23:18] maybe I'm not
[02:23:20] sure yeah I assume it'll like rotate or
[02:23:22] some [ __ ] cuz like Jade spear is not
[02:23:25] here right stuff like that Amos B I
[02:23:27] don't think they're like wow Amos is
[02:23:28] making us so much money maybe but I
[02:23:31] don't Regional B Regional uh I mean yeah
[02:23:35] these are all monat but also monat was
[02:23:37] the first region so but I guess Jong and
[02:23:39] child are old as [ __ ] too I don't
[02:23:43] know but it makes sense like you ask me
[02:23:46] like who should be on standard a year
[02:23:48] ago and I'd be like YULA albo CLE like
[02:23:51] that's like the standard but I didn't
[02:23:52] expect Beacon and Hunter path well I
[02:23:54] guess those should be on standard as
[02:23:56] well um but I'm glad they're
[02:23:58] here that's
[02:24:00] cool isn't it Regional Beacon of the REI
[02:24:03] is not a monstyle weapon neither is
[02:24:04] Hunters so I don't think that's
[02:24:07] the the the like necessarily the
[02:24:10] argument maybe maybe it'll be like mon
[02:24:12] that themed uh but I guess kaching and
[02:24:14] Chichi aren't here maybe you're right
[02:24:15] actually kaching and Chichi are the wait
[02:24:17] is Chi-Chi here it says all of these can
[02:24:19] be chosen wait that means duuke
[02:24:27] better wait so if kaching and chii and
[02:24:30] who else is a [ __ ] standard five star
[02:24:32] is there any other one oh well Big T and
[02:24:33] DEA I guess it might actually be monad
[02:24:35] yeah that makes
[02:24:38] sense thought there's actually a deluke
[02:24:41] banner so if you're like dude there
[02:24:43] there's this one person in my mentions
[02:24:45] that keeps complaining about not having
[02:24:47] duuke for like literally 3 years now now
[02:24:49] they can [ __ ] Force
[02:24:58] duuke you can click Mona if you want to
[02:25:01] words kakomi sorry sorry sorry uh Jean
[02:25:04] if you want a worse sh you sorry Jean's
[02:25:06] good too uh and then YULA CLE and ALB
[02:25:09] are basically Perma rerun now so that's
[02:25:10] cool um
[02:25:15] yeah capital D
[02:25:19] colon Jean's good but as a standard
[02:25:21] character I wouldn't like seek her out
[02:25:23] because if you're going to seek out a
[02:25:25] like effectively limited character Shan
[02:25:28] yun's worst case scenario is usually
[02:25:30] being a jean like that's not a bad thing
[02:25:32] Jean's good but it's like worst case of
[02:25:35] Shan Yun is your Jee which is why one VI
[02:25:37] as soon as she came out I mean there's
[02:25:38] also like drama we're not going to get
[02:25:40] into it but everyone was like oh Shan so
[02:25:42] bad sh like Shen is so Niche it's like
[02:25:43] her Niche is not only good and more vast
[02:25:47] than you think and make gives you a fun
[02:25:50] New play style but at worst she's Jean
[02:25:52] and no one's like oh Gan is so bad but G
[02:25:55] is also standard
[02:26:02] anyways what is this worse any character
[02:26:05] is that you wait wait let's see worse
[02:26:07] any character worse kakomi worse chori
[02:26:10] worse Shang Ling worst Shang Ling worst
[02:26:14] shun okay that's true I mean not true
[02:26:17] not true I don't that's not true that's
[02:26:19] not true that's not
[02:26:20] true uh I mean it is true but I didn't
[02:26:23] say
[02:26:24] that okay but they're also all worst
[02:26:45] strangling it's like weon Banner system
[02:26:47] you can choose what you want it's better
[02:26:49] because well it's 50/50 instead of
[02:26:51] whatever 7030 but it's better be
[02:26:53] actually no it okay so it's better
[02:26:56] because you're guaranteed after one miss
[02:27:00] like it's
[02:27:03] 50/50 and you guaranteed to get whatever
[02:27:06] of the type that you chose so like let's
[02:27:10] say you miss Ula you're guaranteed one
[02:27:12] of these five stars and if you miss a
[02:27:13] weapon you're guaranteed one of the
[02:27:14] weapon five
[02:27:15] stars and I'm very skeptical to like be
[02:27:19] hype about any gacha system because
[02:27:21] gacha is gacha but this looks like this
[02:27:23] sounds really
[02:27:25] good like it doesn't sound like a
[02:27:28] scam which I didn't expect to say
[02:27:31] someone linked a tweet what is
[02:27:33] this oh there's a [ __ ]
[02:27:42] F okay yeah the wish guarantee count
[02:27:45] will continue to accumulate or carry
[02:27:47] over to the next one that means that
[02:27:49] there's
[02:27:50] multiple okay so we know there's going
[02:27:52] to be more than
[02:27:59] one EG in the current CR gold wish you
[02:28:01] could Char course towards Gan and the
[02:28:03] first five star character you obtain is
[02:28:05] Cle as this character is not Gene you
[02:28:08] obtain one fade point you do another 10
[02:28:10] wishes don't receive a five star item
[02:28:12] you're 80 away okay sure once the next
[02:28:15] one begins your
[02:28:17] fate points will be okay yeah yeah well
[02:28:18] that's just fate points yeah fate points
[02:28:20] would be reset which is unfortunate but
[02:28:22] that's how fate works I assume well
[02:28:24] that's how it works right now anyways uh
[02:28:26] the item list
[02:28:28] change item list may change stay tuned
[02:28:32] only event exclusive five stars that
[02:28:33] have not appeared in the event wish at
[02:28:35] least three
[02:28:37] times that have appeared at least three
[02:28:40] times and have not appeared
[02:28:44] recently CR will be available from time
[02:28:46] time to time
[02:28:49] okay it's a
[02:29:02] start the fade is pretty
[02:29:05] weird uh oh well not weird but like fade
[02:29:08] point is very much like if you get it
[02:29:10] you feel incentivized to keep going or
[02:29:12] you lose it but outside of that
[02:29:14] everything's like that's the main uh uh
[02:29:17] downside but I don't know how long they
[02:29:19] last because they don't say it so if it
[02:29:20] lasts a long ass time and you're like
[02:29:22] okay I really want Ula then it's fine to
[02:29:24] pull for it but if it lasts like a month
[02:29:26] or two months then it's like kind of
[02:29:29] hard uh harder to be like harder to like
[02:29:32] guarantee that you'll get the character
[02:29:33] you want unless you have
[02:29:37] enough but I'm going to be honest like I
[02:29:39] could be very pessimistic about it but
[02:29:43] realistically I know people like the the
[02:29:46] people that want Ula enough to like beg
[02:29:48] for a Ula rerun are going to H like
[02:29:51] realistically if you care about that
[02:29:52] character that much you're going to save
[02:29:53] Primos to get them so like this would be
[02:29:55] good for
[02:29:56] you read question
[02:30:00] two uh what will the item list change
[02:30:03] that list may change stay tuned only
[02:30:05] event wa I already read
[02:30:08] this oh wait I skipped question too is
[02:30:12] there a wish guarantee before wish any
[02:30:14] us choose your path it's 50/50 right all
[02:30:18] characters or all
[02:30:19] weapons there's guarantees for five star
[02:30:22] and four
[02:30:24] stars yeah 50% chance and then there's a
[02:30:26] fade Point
[02:30:30] yeah use intertwines
[02:30:35] yeah I mean we knew that right it say
[02:30:37] event that's unfortunate
[02:30:43] though that's cool if you want it
[02:31:02] at least there's no [ __ ]
[02:31:13] Chi-Chi freeo play bait yes well I don't
[02:31:17] know about bait okay let me explain it
[02:31:19] this way if you're free to play the only
[02:31:22] reason you would want any of these
[02:31:23] characters on on your account is if you
[02:31:25] just love them but there's no reason to
[02:31:27] ever get any of these characters
[02:31:28] willingly on your account however if you
[02:31:31] like them the fact that they're there as
[02:31:33] as if they were limited characters is
[02:31:35] good I think any other take
[02:31:39] is I would disagree with it's the the
[02:31:42] the Fate point is weird like that's
[02:31:44] cringe however it's
[02:31:47] effectively if you miss the first one
[02:31:49] you get it second pole and it's
[02:31:52] basically like a limited like a limited
[02:31:55] event B Banner for whatever character
[02:31:58] for either one of these characters if
[02:32:00] you want them so it's like if you're
[02:32:02] like okay I really want a Ula rerun then
[02:32:03] it's as if the Ula rer Run's there
[02:32:06] should you pull on that Banner probably
[02:32:08] not I wouldn't but if you really like
[02:32:11] these characters then they're there same
[02:32:12] with a certain weapon and I would argue
[02:32:15] weapon wise
[02:32:27] I'm not sure if you want a weapon I
[02:32:29] assume the four stars would be worse
[02:32:31] than a weapon Banner because weapon
[02:32:32] banners usually have good weapon well
[02:32:34] not good they're dog [ __ ] but like let's
[02:32:37] say the weapon Banner has good four
[02:32:38] stars here the four stars you get would
[02:32:40] probably just be random [ __ ] like a
[02:32:41] standard pull
[02:32:43] um which would be worse
[02:32:47] but the five star might be better like
[02:32:49] if you want Beacon you guaranteed beacon
[02:32:51] in two PS versus like let's say it's
[02:32:53] Beacon and donut or some
[02:32:57] [ __ ] but you might just got like [ __ ]
[02:33:01] like some dog [ __ ] you don't want eh I'm
[02:33:03] not a big fan of
[02:33:06] weapons but I'm not a big fan of weapon
[02:33:08] BS in general
[02:33:10] so I don't
[02:33:14] know it's basically standard premium
[02:33:20] yeah it would be a lot better if it used
[02:33:22] standard pulls but as it stands it's
[02:33:25] nice if you want the
[02:33:29] yeah legal loophole Market event cuz
[02:33:32] they're limited yeah I mean yeah like
[02:33:35] ideally well here's the thing ideally
[02:33:38] these characters get added to standard
[02:33:40] but
[02:33:42] also I personally don't think like I've
[02:33:45] said this for literally years I think
[02:33:47] characters like YULA ALB and CLE do not
[02:33:50] like they deserve to the charact the
[02:33:52] people that want them deserve to be able
[02:33:53] to pull them but I also don't think
[02:33:55] they're like no one's like yes albo
[02:33:58] rerun like people at ho I'm sure the
[02:34:00] [ __ ] company's not like yes we're
[02:34:02] going to make so much money when we
[02:34:04] rerun CLE like but the people that are
[02:34:06] like waiting for them really want the
[02:34:08] character so it's nice to have a way to
[02:34:10] pull them without needing a [ __ ] 3-
[02:34:12] week rerun where where it's just them
[02:34:14] plus one more character
[02:34:16] so no disrespect to the characters but I
[02:34:19] think that's a a obviously like there's
[02:34:22] ways to make this Banner better but
[02:34:23] that's a good way to go a good way to go
[02:34:25] about it is having a banner where it's
[02:34:27] like hey if you want Ula you can select
[02:34:31] Ula and I guess it's um I wish it just
[02:34:35] instead of being I wish it was a 50/50
[02:34:36] that carried over instead of being a
[02:34:37] Fate The Fate point is the only thing I
[02:34:39] don't like cuz fade points are just like
[02:34:41] oh well you need to pull now or you
[02:34:43] don't get it like if if the banner
[02:34:44] leaves but if the banner lasts a long
[02:34:45] ass time it's better than if the banner
[02:34:47] lasts short we don't know how long the
[02:34:49] banner is going to last so we'll see
[02:34:51] that's the only
[02:34:57] thing still very happy about it though
[02:35:00] um like at worst don't pull on it at
[02:35:05] best you have been waiting for Ula or
[02:35:08] albo or CLE or's weapon or D's weapon or
[02:35:11] ula's weapon and now you can get it
[02:35:13] that's how I view it uh although the
[02:35:16] real at worst is you random like like
[02:35:20] the real at worst is you don't know any
[02:35:22] better and then you pull for like a
[02:35:23] character that's kind of whatever and
[02:35:25] then you get a fade point and you get
[02:35:26] baited into pulling more don't do that
[02:35:28] don't don't fall for bait outside of
[02:35:30] that I think it's it's it's
[02:35:38] po can you lose 50 to another limited
[02:35:41] yes so when you choose character or
[02:35:43] weapon if you lose the 50-50 you get
[02:35:45] another one of either of that so like it
[02:35:48] locks into character or weapon which is
[02:35:50] good but like let's say you lose on Ula
[02:35:52] you can get I think you can get albo I
[02:35:55] think that's how it works could be
[02:36:06] wrong but like I would much rather lose
[02:36:09] to like I would lose if I lose my 5050
[02:36:11] and I get albo I'm I'm not like you know
[02:36:15] you might be pissed if want like CLE but
[02:36:17] I'm a lot happier than getting a
[02:36:38] Chi-Chi uh as far as the weapons
[02:36:44] go these two are yeah yeah I
[02:36:47] mean 1 2 three kind of
[02:36:51] four five
[02:36:53] six I'm going to count these two as one
[02:36:56] seven there's like seven pretty good
[02:36:57] weapons but they're St like these are
[02:36:59] standard weapons so it's like it's not
[02:37:01] like y you might already have
[02:37:03] them uh and then hund path and Beacon
[02:37:06] are pretty crack but you
[02:37:09] know I wish Jade spear was here I'm
[02:37:12] happy Amos
[02:37:14] isn't
[02:37:28] yeah but it's now it's not 25050 for a
[02:37:30] weapon okay yeah so I think the biggest
[02:37:33] scam that has ever been scammed in scam
[02:37:36] is weapon man especially the old weapon
[02:37:38] man but even now it's like at worst you
[02:37:41] like let's say I charge something I'm
[02:37:42] not pulling but let's say you do let's
[02:37:44] say I get Jay Spar that's one J spear
[02:37:46] again that's two and then you get
[02:37:48] kagura now it's like not now but like
[02:37:51] for this Banner it's if you miss a
[02:37:53] weapon let's say you want Beacon you get
[02:37:55] Skyward spine your next five star is
[02:37:57] guaranteed to be Beacon which is still
[02:38:01] not ideal but it's better than this how
[02:38:03] the only thing that's worse than this is
[02:38:05] that now like on this one you can lose
[02:38:06] and you can get the other limited one
[02:38:08] like you could get like I would argue
[02:38:10] this Banner is like [ __ ] Jade is
[02:38:12] standard so it's a bad example but like
[02:38:14] let's say it's like and like Jade cutter
[02:38:17] losing to Jade cutter is a lot better
[02:38:19] than losing to like Skyward spine and uh
[02:38:23] weapon matters sometimes have really
[02:38:24] good raid up four stars like favonius
[02:38:27] weapons and [ __ ] but outside of that the
[02:38:30] the five star like pity is
[02:38:33] better uh except yeah no that's
[02:38:40] it but yeah I mean even on this weapon B
[02:38:43] you can lose to a standard one like you
[02:38:44] can get Skyward spine on this one
[02:38:46] I'm pretty sure I literally just did I
[02:38:47] just got a Skyward spine I'm pretty
[02:38:52] sure never mind cran echoing call sorry
[02:38:55] sorry sorry but I did get a Skyward
[02:38:57] spine somewhere was it from a permanent
[02:38:58] wish where did I get a Skyward spine I
[02:39:01] remember Shan was like Skyward and I got
[02:39:03] a Skyward maybe it was weap matter I
[02:39:05] don't
[02:39:10] know I don't
[02:39:14] know the pity cares over to the next but
[02:39:16] the guarantee does not yes I think I
[02:39:18] think that's what they said so it's like
[02:39:21] yeah the only time it would really suck
[02:39:23] is if you get like you lose 50-50 and
[02:39:27] then you don't have enough to get the
[02:39:28] character you want and then it expires
[02:39:29] but I don't know how long it's going to
[02:39:30] last and
[02:39:31] second please don't just randomly like I
[02:39:35] don't recom like if the banner isn't
[02:39:37] lasting a long time then it's I don't
[02:39:38] recommend pulling unless you have enough
[02:39:41] to like keep going if you lose a
[02:39:43] 50/50 but I assume it's going last a
[02:39:46] while but I don't know and
[02:39:48] also because this Banner is so like
[02:39:50] Niche like no like meta player is going
[02:39:52] to be like I need CLE notice spectac
[02:39:55] Cally I feel like if you're someone who
[02:39:57] really has been wanting for one of these
[02:39:59] reruns for a while you're probably
[02:40:00] saving
[02:40:01] Primos or not or you're just rolling the
[02:40:04] dice that happens
[02:40:09] too so I think it's a net
[02:40:14] positive
[02:40:22] I thought they would give us extra
[02:40:23] rewards you must be new here man you hey
[02:40:25] it's been three years you must be
[02:40:39] new here man take a fowl take a fowl and
[02:40:43] and sit

[02:40:58] the what's happened to Ho

[02:59:07] mean I
[02:59:10] mean that's
[02:59:12] good
[02:59:16] H I don't think that's better than our
[02:59:17] set
[02:59:21] though yeah I don't think that's good
[02:59:24] enough I
[02:59:33] mean okay
[02:59:38] wait wa let me
[02:59:42] see
[02:59:51] [Music]
[02:59:53] wait I can fast equip right cuz I
[02:59:54] unequipped
[02:59:57] everything wait that actually
[03:00:01] worked okay that's copium
[03:00:04] [Music]
[03:00:12] but
[03:00:14] why is our crit
[03:00:16] [Music]
[03:00:21] damage wait
[03:00:23] 91.9 234 2467 let me write that
[03:00:30] down
[03:00:33] Life 2
[03:00:35] 467 91 Point something 9 2 3 4 2 3
[03:00:42] 4
[03:00:45] [Music]
[03:00:54] it's like barely
[03:00:56] [Music]
[03:01:05] better I okay I guess we need CR rate
[03:01:08] let me
[03:01:10] see what's our Miss crit rate piece
[03:01:14] honestly if we need crit raate this is
[03:01:16] better maybe we got crit damage build
[03:01:17] done wait one
[03:01:22] [Music]
[03:01:35] [Music]
[03:01:42] sec
[03:01:45] wait no we actually need crit rate on
[03:01:46] our sh well I guess Shan Yun gives us
[03:01:47] 10% so we technically
[03:01:50] don't but we still should wait
[03:01:54] [Music]
[03:01:58] okay is it ever an offset ciret
[03:02:02] angle this is our best ciret crit rate
[03:02:06] 21 15
[03:02:12] 11
[03:02:22] blizzard Sands this is not even that
[03:02:25] much worse our sand is literally only
[03:02:27] one crit rate roll better so this is
[03:02:29] actually good our feathers also insane I
[03:02:32] have a perfect feather though like this
[03:02:35] every subsat is
[03:02:37] [Music]
[03:02:42] good
[03:02:53] [Music]
[03:02:57] no this is
[03:02:59] lower I'm on Jade wait that's wait wa
[03:03:02] wait
[03:03:06] wait the [ __ ] was I
[03:03:12] using
[03:03:17] our attack is exactly the same we lost
[03:03:20] three crit rate for
[03:03:23] 10 15 crit damage which is actually
[03:03:26] higher crit value but it's going to be
[03:03:28] worse because uh
[03:03:35] shun minus 100 attack I wrote 2367
[03:03:39] down how do we lose 100 attack our
[03:03:42] flower dude wait did
[03:03:46] we maybe I
[03:03:50] typoed it was 24 67 oh maybe I'm just
[03:03:54] wait why the [ __ ] did I write 2
[03:03:56] three okay then it is worse damn that
[03:03:59] goet
[03:04:00] sucks wait Maybe not maybe we do what
[03:04:04] flower are we on maybe we keep the
[03:04:07] flower our flower is not even that
[03:04:12] bad
[03:04:14] why is it worth with shenyun no it's
[03:04:15] worth without
[03:04:20] shenon okay this is five Vermillion
[03:04:23] which honestly this is pretty good uh
[03:04:26] like this is actually
[03:04:42] good
[03:04:47] I think I want the ER roll if I'm being
[03:04:49] a [ __ ] aasha cringer if I'm not then
[03:04:52] I don't want the ER or and I don't want
[03:04:55] the the crit rate like I don't need more
[03:04:58] than this cuz realistically this is
[03:05:00] wasted if I go
[03:05:04] higher which means I would
[03:05:12] do
[03:05:15] yeah like if I don't care about
[03:05:19] anything then I do this maybe this one's
[03:05:22] probably more efficient but let's say
[03:05:27] this and I need literally zero ER so we
[03:05:32] would need oh wait I'm on hom yeah I'm
[03:05:33] on
[03:05:38] hom now we go for a crit damage flower
[03:05:41] maybe I guess here offset flower would
[03:05:43] actually help cuz I could go crit damage
[03:05:45] so I could
[03:05:46] do oh wait this is [ __ ]
[03:05:49] good oh no but
[03:05:52] it's oh but the substats are so
[03:05:54] efficient but I don't care about the
[03:06:00] ER no I don't care about
[03:06:03] the wait so I
[03:06:10] do
[03:06:12] life
[03:06:14] far
[03:06:19] away I mean this is our attack is low
[03:06:23] why is our attack so
[03:06:24] low oh I was on hom before wait does hom
[03:06:28] even give more attack what attack have
[03:06:29] with oh yeah I guess out of
[03:06:37] combat I'll [ __ ] optimize it
[03:06:42] later
[03:06:47] oh yeah our passive is on because we're
[03:06:48] [ __ ] we're
[03:06:50] [ __ ] yeah we're like one
[03:07:00] HP
[03:07:06] life
[03:07:11] life the road
[03:07:17] well also this gives attack okay yeah
[03:07:20] I'm G to have to figure this
[03:07:22] out
[03:07:25] uh wait what's our worst
[03:07:37] piece yeah is our flower or
[03:07:42] ciret but I
[03:07:45] also cir are a lot harder though cuz
[03:07:47] it's one
[03:07:49] sub was probably
[03:07:52] flower use the 50 crit value sand okay
[03:07:57] but I don't even think the 50 CR cre
[03:07:59] value sand is like that good compared to
[03:08:01] this
[03:08:04] one cuz this is like 45 CR value
[03:08:10] 44 it's 44 but I have ER
[03:08:14] [Music]
[03:08:17] this one's
[03:08:23] 50 what if I just do
[03:08:39] [Music]
[03:08:42] twopiece
[03:08:45] wait this is very even I like that
[03:08:49] 96.0 200.0
[03:08:52] 100.0 I like that straight to the
[03:08:57] point [ __ ] ER why the [ __ ] would I
[03:09:00] [Music]
[03:09:11] need
[03:09:14] crit value
[03:09:16] Andy dude I mean okay I actually don't
[03:09:19] need ER though like no
[03:09:27] copium shun gives 4% against single
[03:09:30] Target making it 100% see I like the way
[03:09:33] you
[03:09:34] think okay we'll see we we're going to
[03:09:37] go from rank 24 to rank like six uh
[03:09:39] [ __ ] like
[03:09:41] 600
[03:09:43] far
[03:09:45] away yeah we're 128 now so much
[03:09:50] [Music]
[03:10:03] worse
[03:10:06] well cuz Okay the thing is let's say we
[03:10:10] do five piece right let's say we do five
[03:10:11] piece
[03:10:13] the problem isn't that I don't have a
[03:10:15] good
[03:10:16] Vermilion the problem
[03:10:19] is that our worst piece is our goblet
[03:10:22] like it's still the Goblet after
[03:10:25] that I don't think it's even
[03:10:28] close uh let me
[03:10:33] see yeah
[03:10:35] look this goblet is dude look at how
[03:10:39] [ __ ] this
[03:10:41] is
[03:10:49] so at this point our our upgrade isn't
[03:10:52] even a Vermillion goblet it's an offset
[03:11:07] goblet no this is still the best
[03:11:11] one
[03:11:21] honestly [ __ ]
[03:11:25] it never
[03:11:35] mind you can get better flower why are

[03:36:54] better than my sha it actually pisses me
[03:36:56] off but
[03:36:59] um this is definitely not our best build
[03:37:02] I just don't feel like optimizing it but
[03:37:03] it could definitely be better
[03:37:05] because uh this flower sucks dick
[03:37:08] compared to like the crit value is
[03:37:09] really [ __ ]
[03:37:11] high but like er is like lowkey more
[03:37:14] valuable
[03:37:20] here actually I think our goblets our
[03:37:22] worst piece on

[03:38:09] oops
[03:38:20] dude what even is my best Hydro
[03:38:22] goblet probably we probably need crit
[03:38:24] rate so probably that one but this is
[03:38:27] the same crit rate and it's on set all
[03:38:29] we lose is one [ __ ] roll so that
[03:38:31] can't be the best
[03:38:39] one
[03:38:43] I'm
[03:38:48] tilted maybe it is offset
[03:39:01] flower let the game

[03:51:21] for being tired I didn't sleep last
[03:51:22] night uh and we'll do the abyss and
[03:51:23] stuff next stream I'll try to stream
[03:51:24] very soon um oh no never mind this is
[03:51:29] still worse than our last build
[03:51:38] but
[03:51:39] I I was 30 with this goblet just wanted
[03:51:42] to share that the first time I ever
[03:51:44] doned I thank making me last and he told
[03:51:47] me to shut
[03:51:49] up our last one's 24 but
[03:51:52] still that didn't happen
[03:51:57] still
[03:52:03] whatever third IO we used to be one I
[03:52:06] think if I my AO can always be one if I
[03:52:09] like optimize a bit better I just I kind
[03:52:11] of slap whatever looks good wait number
[03:52:14] one is the [ __ ] this guy's 69 crit rate
[03:52:17] what the [ __ ] is wrong with this person
[03:52:19] the damn will sooner die bro you are
[03:52:20] literally YULA what are you
[03:52:23] doing okay I mean this artifact's
[03:52:25] [ __ ] insane that one's pretty good
[03:52:29] that one's
[03:52:29] insane okay I mean makes sense but he's
[03:52:33] literally 69 crit rate dude what the
[03:52:38] [ __ ]
[03:52:50] two
[03:52:53] based am I trying too hard to get crit
[03:52:56] rate maybe I'm trying too
[03:52:58] hard maybe that's the
[03:53:00] problem dude imagine like if I have this
[03:53:03] but with two attack like attack and then
[03:53:05] an attack roll it would be so much
[03:53:06] better but I don't have it
[03:53:10] it's
[03:53:29] fine maybe I just uh maybe I'm coping
[03:53:32] too
[03:53:32] much like maybe I'm supposed to go
[03:53:37] Jade
[03:53:48] anyways anyways we'll leave this for
[03:53:50] another
[03:53:52] time we'll leave this for another
[03:54:04] time 25%
[03:54:07] attack
[03:54:13] is that ever an
[03:54:19] angle
