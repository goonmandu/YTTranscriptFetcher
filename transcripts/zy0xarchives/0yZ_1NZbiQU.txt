[00:37:53] yeah is there pink there there's nothing
[00:37:56] wrong with your build let me just
[00:37:57] explain to you
[00:37:59] okay you told me no sorry sorry sorry
[00:38:01] I'm sorry yeah I told you you told me
[00:38:04] that this isn't my number one bu couple
[00:38:07] years ago when you built your Shia you
[00:38:08] had this is my number one build
[00:38:11] yeah so you're telling me that you spent
[00:38:15] 100 to 150,000 resident in this game to
[00:38:18] change your build from probably what I
[00:38:21] assume was a two piece two piece build
[00:38:23] to four piece per million true yeah
[00:38:28] what about it with slightly worse stats
[00:38:30] what do you mean slightly worse okay
[00:38:32] this isn't my best build to be fair this
[00:38:34] is a random uh one but I have my best uh
[00:38:37] sha Vermilion is on H but I think if you
[00:38:39] use hom you're a cringe Lord that's all
[00:38:43] uh also this cringe Lord and this is
[00:38:46] also some attack Subs cuz Optimizer
[00:38:48] likes attack Subs actually there's not
[00:38:49] even that many just fair yeah optim like
[00:38:51] attack dude
[00:38:52] the so dude the aasha is so stupid cuz
[00:38:55] the sh doesn't even use shenyun shenyun
[00:38:57] doesn't give a [ __ ] about child's attack
[00:38:59] and she gives eight like up to 10% crit
[00:39:01] rate and and guess what okay the number
[00:39:04] ones have like 99 crit rate well guess
[00:39:06] what the [ __ ] happens with Shan Yun
[00:39:08] nothing sorry it's okay I I just want
[00:39:12] you to know that like you
[00:39:14] know you might be diseased that the
[00:39:18] value of your sh build depends so much
[00:39:21] on an arbitrary website but I also
[00:39:25] suffer from this same disease and I also
[00:39:27] would like my characters to do well on
[00:39:29] that arbitrary website I know and like I
[00:39:31] know I'm number one but if if I want to
[00:39:33] like prove number one by the way I am
[00:39:35] number if if you if I put my actual
[00:39:37] number one build no one is better when
[00:39:39] you factor in shanon but it I can't
[00:39:41] explain that I don't need ER okay I'm
[00:39:43] building 130 ER CU it's optimal but I
[00:39:46] don't need ER what type of sh player
[00:39:47] needs ER if you're a Shia man and you
[00:39:49] have C6 fars on and you need ER seek

[00:47:59] what the [ __ ] um
[00:48:01] okay are you ready we have to like go
[00:48:04] through the the
[00:48:06] prefaces yeah
[00:48:09] okay okay a few things first of all what
[00:48:13] is like the forfeit like what do what do
[00:48:15] I get when I inevitably
[00:48:17] win you're not going to
[00:48:20] win like you can you can skip your vilon
[00:48:23] you can strongbox emblem all you want
[00:48:24] you're not going to win do you know what
[00:48:26] your title is going to
[00:48:27] be I [ __ ] clear the floor and defeat
[00:48:31] the almighty short okay cuz I was
[00:48:34] thinking I was like what would I make
[00:48:35] the title if I lose and if I do I could
[00:48:37] be like I could be like I spent like I
[00:48:41] lost $500 for this piece if I like have
[00:48:44] to gift like a 100
[00:48:46] Subs
[00:48:48] boom but I don't know what our forfeit
[00:48:50] is but I'm not gonna lose I was thinking
[00:48:52] it would probably be simple because like
[00:48:55] you know
[00:48:56] I've done so many of these videos but I
[00:48:59] was thinking like maybe we could title
[00:49:00] this like artifact Showdown or some
[00:49:03] [ __ ] like
[00:49:04] that like yoia versus
[00:49:08] Hut and then I would just say it's
[00:49:10] simple it would just be three words I
[00:49:12] destroyed Zio nothing else it's just
[00:49:16] simple as that man all that's all you
[00:49:19] deserve you just deserve three
[00:49:21] words Li speaks up a balding dwarf at St
[00:49:24] I'm not balding sorry
[00:49:28] uh in no not in bed I did not destroy
[00:49:31] him in bed that's weird sorry wait why
[00:49:33] is that weird sorry sorry sorry that's
[00:49:35] notd sorry sorry that's sorry let me
[00:49:38] change my team farzon gives me bad
[00:49:42] vibes who do you think let's let's start
[00:49:44] with the controversial take who do you
[00:49:45] think is the worst designed character in
[00:49:47] genin what do you mean by Design you can
[00:49:50] interpret that however you
[00:49:53] want you could say like gameplay wise
[00:49:55] kit wise the looks wise well not looks
[00:49:58] like design
[00:50:02] wise if I say what I want to say
[00:50:07] then a lot of people are going to be
[00:50:10] upset okay I'll you okay you're going to
[00:50:12] say sh but you're actually just Co
[00:50:14] coping you're actually just coping the
[00:50:17] real make up a reason yeah why the call
[00:50:24] sh
[00:50:26] what was yours uh Faron because all of
[00:50:30] her [ __ ] potential is in C6 and it
[00:50:33] upsets me do you know do you know what
[00:50:35] what it feels like to not have C6 fars
[00:50:36] on can I explain can I give you an
[00:50:37] analogy world is a whole lot easier
[00:50:40] imagine you're like you're you're
[00:50:41] traveling okay so and you forgot to pack
[00:50:43] your toothbrush but you have toothpaste
[00:50:46] so like well my my teeth are like dirty
[00:50:48] I'm going to go to bed but I'm going to
[00:50:49] brush my teeth I'm a sanitary individual
[00:50:51] but you don't have a toothbrush so C
[00:50:53] Faron is like you pour the toothpaste on
[00:50:54] your finger and like using your finger
[00:50:56] to like brush your teeth and it's better
[00:50:58] than nothing but it's it's so much worse
[00:51:01] than having a fully like a good
[00:51:03] toothbrush which is C6 Horizon okay
[00:51:06] that's that's the difference between c0
[00:51:08] and C6 oh got it all right I'll
[00:51:10] Counterpoint you so you know I'm taking
[00:51:12] your argument all right C6 farizon is
[00:51:16] insane it's got all the packages for a
[00:51:18] beautiful Nemo support y all right C is
[00:51:22] Bare Bones got nothing feeling up took a
[00:51:25] character that was Bare Bones then gave
[00:51:28] them six constellations oh no and then
[00:51:31] they were still Bare Bones D
[00:51:34] okay but she's
[00:51:40] pretty I
[00:51:44] mean I who are you talking about I said
[00:51:46] Dory I said Dory oh Dory oh yeah Dory
[00:51:49] doesn't has no reason to exist but I
[00:51:51] thought you talking about
[00:51:53] DEA okay okay no I I I I haded Dory very
[00:51:57] quickly in the way I was speaking cuz
[00:51:59] you know yeah but wa have you heard
[00:52:01] about the listen listen brother all
[00:52:03] right de
[00:52:07] here can we move on to the next subject
[00:52:09] thank
[00:52:10] you she's gotten better with the Vette
[00:52:13] true
[00:52:16] true true dor is like the only battery
[00:52:19] that needs a
[00:52:21] battery she's like here's the thing like
[00:52:23] okay I didn't actually believe that Dory
[00:52:26] was like that terrible
[00:52:28] until I did an account review and I
[00:52:32] actually used C6 Dory and it was
[00:52:34] legitimately one of the most
[00:52:36] traumatizing experiences of my entire
[00:52:38] life I kid you not I did not it was like
[00:52:41] a year after she I just I don't don't
[00:52:43] she's a Jare talk about it it was it
[00:52:47] was
[00:52:50] yeah I also think rizzly C1 should be
[00:52:54] part of his base kit because it's so
[00:52:55] cringe to not charge attack on a
[00:52:57] character who's like designed around
[00:52:58] charge attack character there are
[00:53:00] definitely some characters who C1 should
[00:53:02] have been a c0 or even their passive
[00:53:06] Talent should be like a part
[00:53:08] of like wait what was I saying no sorry
[00:53:11] their constellation should be a part of
[00:53:13] their passive Talent that's what I
[00:53:14] that's what I was I agree I think
[00:53:17] certain characters certain five stars
[00:53:18] shouldn't have an ability until you get
[00:53:20] C6 like their alt shouldn't it's like
[00:53:22] locked behind like you can't press q and
[00:53:24] then when you spend enough money it
[00:53:27] unlocks that's the future
[00:53:29] of what the hell did I just hear you
[00:53:32] going to [ __ ] lock characters burst
[00:53:35] behind a c that would be that would be
[00:53:37] so dude that would suck but it would be
[00:53:42] funny and like like floor 15 it's like
[00:53:45] you have 15 seconds and if you don't
[00:53:47] enter your credit card information
[00:53:49] within 15 seconds you just die aren't
[00:53:51] you f2p though yeah I'm Prett to play
[00:53:54] standing around free to play Plus or
[00:53:56] like after I'm free to play but I'm
[00:53:58] giving genin ideas so that they think
[00:54:00] that endgame would make the money so
[00:54:01] that they release it so you're welcome
[00:54:03] in
[00:54:04] advance
[00:54:06] ah all right f2p Pro

[00:54:42] but I kind of forget itated one don't
[00:54:45] play it shut the hell up pleas and I
[00:54:47] know you already lost it's okay he's
[00:54:49] going to
[00:54:51] play my sights have been set Soul where
[00:54:54] the [ __ ] is
[00:54:55] so sorry all just too quiet okay are we
[00:54:59] are we doing this
[00:55:02] yeah please answer last question
[00:55:05] no sorry I think it's time so Mr
[00:55:10] socks yeah let's talk about the
[00:55:13] structure how we're going to do this
[00:55:16] agreed yeah I'm so I'm still hellbent on
[00:55:19] the title cuz if if your I destroyed Zio
[00:55:23] then I'm [ __ ]
[00:55:25] I'm going to be like I came everywhere
[00:55:28] mytle you know what we should do we
[00:55:29] should make it vague we we in the title
[00:55:32] we should not tell who
[00:55:35] want yeah yeah you could do like I like
[00:55:40] I wris it all or some [ __ ] and I'll do
[00:55:43] like I spent X on this pie like if I
[00:55:46] okay if I do Vermilion it would be like
[00:55:48] on Sha but I think I'm doing emblem for
[00:55:51] fairness we can figure it out after we
[00:55:53] figure here are the for I think vague is
[00:55:55] best because like you know they they
[00:55:58] know I'm going to win but it's better
[00:56:00] for them to not it's like the shoing
[00:56:03] right shinger Victory don't know until
[00:56:05] you actually see oh yeah I I actually I
[00:56:07] was friends with shinger back in the
[00:56:10] day can we just [ __ ] this [ __ ] guy
[00:56:13] dude a [ __ ] I was friends with
[00:56:17] shinger
[00:56:19] yeah all right so how this going to work
[00:56:24] yeah Mr sock spent 200 years to get 390
[00:56:30] or more artifacts that can be fed into
[00:56:32] the strong box is that is that correct
[00:56:34] yes I have over 390 strong boxable five
[00:56:39] star artifacts okay not bad not bad all
[00:56:41] right so what we're going to do is we're
[00:56:42] going to do a first round all right
[00:56:44] we're going to do a first round we're
[00:56:45] going to convert 10 Rounds which is 390
[00:56:47] pieces and we are going
[00:56:50] to if you see something that you would
[00:56:53] roll
[00:56:55] plus see if it gets the right stat for
[00:56:57] you blah blah blah if it's already four
[00:56:59] line start you lock it but we don't roll
[00:57:01] them until after we both go our separate
[00:57:03] ways get our pieces okay we're going to
[00:57:06] watch each other get [ __ ] on Roll
[00:57:09] watch each other get [ __ ] those are my
[00:57:11] favorite on rolls context
[00:57:13] brother I'm
[00:57:16] down but I'm not going to get [ __ ] on
[00:57:18] rolls fair fair disclosure you're going
[00:57:20] get [ __ ] one we're going to both do
[00:57:22] the same emblem set so that so that it's
[00:57:25] like people won't be like oh oh oh ER is
[00:57:28] is is so bad on Vermilion but then
[00:57:30] emblem is so much easier to build
[00:57:31] because every stat good on emblem sure
[00:57:33] I'm sorry but I it would take you would
[00:57:36] have to I would have to lick the ground
[00:57:37] before I tried to strong boss for
[00:57:39] million it's I just like listen there
[00:57:41] I'm not not to offend you all right I
[00:57:43] know that you love that that that domain
[00:57:46] but like I I seriously I I no no I
[00:57:49] actually say I say the domain is
[00:57:51] terrible I like people like I I don't
[00:57:54] ever go to [ __ ] Vermillion I do it
[00:57:56] because I I I I I there's nothing in my
[00:57:59] life that is going better than like
[00:58:00] there's nothing in my life that I look
[00:58:02] forward to more than building my sh so
[00:58:04] why would I do anything
[00:58:06] else hearing this man explain why he
[00:58:08] does things that he recommends dearly to
[00:58:11] people not to do is the
[00:58:12] most dude Al you're a hypocrite no I'm
[00:58:16] not strong orillion or far but I can do
[00:58:20] whatever I want it's my life I can say
[00:58:22] don't Gamble and then gamble all my
[00:58:23] money identities to choose from need me
[00:58:27] to come up with some anyways good talk
[00:58:30] yes you know you know I will I will let
[00:58:33] Mr Socks play with his toys it's
[00:58:36] all yes the toys that I have to put back
[00:58:39] after you're done playing with because
[00:58:42] you just leave them on the floor no I
[00:58:43] don't I picked them
[00:58:45] up
[00:58:47] okay okay we'll do it uh we we'll
[00:58:50] evaluate substats wait are we going for
[00:58:52] best piece or best pieces like if I get
[00:58:55] 50 good pieces and you get one but yours
[00:58:57] is better than all 50 who wins M that's
[00:59:00] a good question how do we want to
[00:59:01] determine that I don't know anything but
[00:59:04] I I feel like I feel like we're battling
[00:59:08] you know I feel like it's it's for that
[00:59:11] one it's for for One Piece yeah okay
[00:59:15] also we're going to assume the set
[00:59:17] doesn't matter and it's just based on
[00:59:19] stat like for example I mean I guess
[00:59:22] context matters like if you have a geog
[00:59:23] goblet defense percent is good
[00:59:25] yeah but like if let's say I do like a
[00:59:28] run of husk and I get a geog goblet and
[00:59:30] you did emblem I don't want you to be
[00:59:32] punished for doing emblem yeah I I think
[00:59:35] we'll figure we can we can figure that
[00:59:36] out after we see the roles because I
[00:59:38] think what what I think will be what
[00:59:41] will be good is um after we see the
[00:59:43] pieces that we get it'll be kind of
[00:59:46] clear if one piece is better than the
[00:59:48] other like obviously there's going to be
[00:59:50] the Nuance of different main
[00:59:52] stat also a lot harder to get in you
[00:59:55] know most pieces because goblet is one
[00:59:58] of those things um and also you know we
[01:00:01] can also ask chat to see you know what
[01:00:04] they think between X piece versus y
[01:00:06] piece like between your piece versus my
[01:00:08] piece yeah speaking of One Piece do have
[01:00:10] you seen do Flamingo do you know what he
[01:00:11] looks like do you think he looks like me

[01:02:39] chat please one yes please
[01:02:43] one there's not even
[01:02:52] one anyways
[01:02:56] what if you get double crit anemo goblet
[01:02:58] on
[01:02:59] emblem okay chat uh I want to say
[01:03:02] something we have over 100 pieces of
[01:03:04] strongbox I farmed more up artifact XP
[01:03:06] we're ready okay and whoever gets the
[01:03:09] best piece wins and we're both going to
[01:03:10] do I told slice we're both going to do
[01:03:12] emblem so that the sub stats are fair
[01:03:13] now what slice doesn't know is that I
[01:03:16] never actually planned on doing emblem
[01:03:17] and this whole time I want to do
[01:03:19] Vermillion but I didn't want to tell
[01:03:21] him dude dude dude dude dude
[01:03:25] um it's it's dude cuz what if we get the
[01:03:29] perfect child piece on the wrong set
[01:03:32] then what then
[01:03:37] what let me give you guys a quick
[01:03:39] rundown on what my sh looks like now may
[01:03:41] I'll take one more day my sh has an
[01:03:44] amazing feather an amazing sand really
[01:03:47] good offset goblet onset Vermillion
[01:03:49] sucks so that could be good that could
[01:03:51] be a good upgrade and a pretty good
[01:03:52] circlet I have a lot of different
[01:03:53] circlets uh to choose from I don't know
[01:03:55] why I just on yeah a lot of them right
[01:03:56] but my flower is kind of okay it's good
[01:03:59] but it's not insane so I could get a
[01:04:01] Vermillion flower upgrade or Goblin
[01:04:04] upgrade and it would be insane however I
[01:04:07] understand that this context of this
[01:04:09] video will look better if I do emblem
[01:04:11] cuz there's more pieces I could do so
[01:04:13] what I think we're going to do is maybe
[01:04:15] we'll do like one maybe two emblem runs
[01:04:18] to try to like actually have a chance at
[01:04:20] winning and then we'll do Vermillion cuz
[01:04:22] I I rather improve my cow than anyone
[01:04:25] else doctor he is out again concerned
[01:04:28] just do emblem nobody likes
[01:04:34] you that was a bit far um I'm going to
[01:04:37] manually click on artifacts at the start
[01:04:39] just in case there's a really good piece
[01:04:40] I forgot to
[01:04:42] lock
[01:04:43] um no I don't think it matters all right
[01:04:47] first one we're going to start with
[01:04:48] emblem we're going to start with emblem
[01:04:50] we're going to start with
[01:04:53] emblem
[01:04:58] we'll do one emblem if it's good we'll
[01:05:00] keep doing emblem if it's bad we'll do
[01:05:02] Vermillion oh it looks like it was bad
[01:05:04] we'll do ver I got a new that sucks so
[01:05:07] far three this could be good I guess
[01:05:09] we'll lock it uh could be good I don't
[01:05:12] know if it's worth leveling I like you
[01:05:15] you my f streammer appreciate it
[01:05:22] though this could be good that's a high
[01:05:24] roll that is a high roll crit rate uh
[01:05:27] obviously the two other stats eh well it
[01:05:29] could be HP is good for Yan okay good
[01:05:31] good good we Lo it unlucky um unlucky
[01:05:35] maybe could get crit
[01:05:37] rate maybe a ride in piece dude emblem
[01:05:40] that's the thing with emblem dude every
[01:05:42] piece could be good cuz everyone can use
[01:05:44] every piece if this is vermilion I don't
[01:05:46] care but it's emblem so it could be good
[01:05:48] for
[01:05:52] ryen Okay so um we locked a few pieces
[01:05:56] maybe I should keep track of how many I
[01:05:57] lock but I don't
[01:06:00] know keep doing emblem then okay one
[01:06:03] more

[01:29:04] Shang Ling while I
[01:29:14] go have I ever cross P you know the the
[01:29:18] interesting thing is I think about Mr so
[01:29:20] asking that to me I'm like has Mr SAU
[01:29:23] cross
[01:29:24] peed because like how would he think
[01:29:26] about the concept of cross
[01:29:29] peing if he didn't already experience
[01:29:31] cross peeing and like my first thought
[01:29:33] was like who would he have cross peed
[01:29:36] with well that's obvious we know who he
[01:29:39] would have cross peed with now the thing
[01:29:41] is we would need a testimony from that
[01:29:43] side to see if cross peing actually
[01:29:46] happened you know what I'm
[01:29:49] saying yeah that's my thought that's
[01:29:52] that's what I

[01:40:13] actually sorry but I will forgive you if
[01:40:14] this was emblem this would have been
[01:40:15] like a shanglin piece right so this is
[01:40:18] good but it's not but it's not
[01:40:21] it's not vermilion's a viable set on

[01:41:01] over you see here's the thing and this
[01:41:05] is why Vermilion that we set imagine if

[01:47:59] [ __ ] nothing nothing with socks you
[01:48:01] didn't hear that okay
[01:48:03] sorry um okay what's the best way to
[01:48:05] roll these I guess I'll roll like worst
[01:48:07] to best and then yeah you can choose you
[01:48:09] can choose cuz I know that your three
[01:48:11] lines are you should probably start with
[01:48:12] your single line crit cuz they're
[01:48:13] probably going to break yeah wait what
[01:48:15] do you mean break like they're going to
[01:48:18] roll the [ __ ] okay that's kind of toxic
[01:48:20] but okay um also yeah we need to
[01:48:24] maximize this cuz any good roll that's
[01:48:25] that's a plus one YouTube short yeah and
[01:48:28] also you know what we better maybe how
[01:48:30] about how about um if you get a good
[01:48:32] piece or a decent piece then it's my
[01:48:34] turn to try to roll a decent piece like
[01:48:36] we should alternate like it shouldn't
[01:48:37] all just be your roles we got to I'm
[01:48:39] down I'm down I'm
[01:48:40] down let him go okay okay okay your four
[01:48:43] line first hit crit okay first piece
[01:48:46] yeah yeah it rolls good okay okay not
[01:48:49] bad not this is optimal for a Fab D
[01:48:51] character watch this yeah actually not
[01:48:53] bad get [ __ ] okay it can still you
[01:48:57] could still say
[01:49:00] okay I don't think it's worth it I
[01:49:02] personally don't think it's worth
[01:49:04] it this is so never mind uh no shot
[01:49:08] you're going to do that okay that's
[01:49:10] pretty mid that's what's the what's I
[01:49:13] mean What's the total set on that it's
[01:49:14] like 40 no no I just I have like yeah
[01:49:17] it's not a bad piece but my thing with
[01:49:18] Mar CH is I have like 5 100 feathers
[01:49:20] that I never use I see there's no way
[01:49:23] you're going to use this on a on a on a
[01:49:24] single line crit no no why would I do
[01:49:26] that what the
[01:49:28] hell okay yeah you got kind of Bon there
[01:49:31] buddy that's not that badad 30% stat not
[01:49:36] bad that's kind of you I can't lie you
[01:49:38] can do better you can do do better let
[01:49:39] me do better let me do better 30%
[01:49:42] St yeah I can do better okay um let's
[01:49:46] roll something that's like mediocre you
[01:49:48] know you have to [ __ ] roll that go go
[01:49:50] is
[01:49:50] [ __ ] dude no this is like the this is
[01:49:53] the let me teach you a lesson okay we're
[01:49:55] saving the beut let me give you some
[01:49:56] some streaming uh uh my streaming
[01:49:59] philosophy okay maybe there's upand
[01:50:01] coming streamers right you're like oh
[01:50:03] give me some here's some you have to
[01:50:04] Edge your viewers with like a piece
[01:50:06] that's like oh look at how good this is
[01:50:08] and then they're like oh roll it roll it
[01:50:10] and then they their attention stays till
[01:50:12] the end of the stream when you actually
[01:50:13] do roll
[01:50:15] it yes I feel definitely like I'm
[01:50:17] getting edged by you exactly that's the
[01:50:19] goal
[01:50:21] this piece I don't think is very good
[01:50:22] let's just Chuck it it's just HP ER crit
[01:50:23] damage so like it could be good right it
[01:50:26] could be I don't know why you're
[01:50:29] laughing I don't know why you're
[01:50:30] laughing if it roll Splat HP you're
[01:50:33] done okay okay pass it's it's pass if
[01:50:35] you're like coping on your lawn cuz cuz
[01:50:38] the roll is decently high it's it's not
[01:50:40] a low roll if it were a low roll then
[01:50:41] I'd be like dead but you know all right
[01:50:43] what's the next roll it dude dude dude
[01:50:47] dudee I don't know if you want to keep
[01:50:49] going on that one but I mean it would be
[01:50:52] funny if it got 25
[01:50:55] HP No
[01:50:57] No aort abort
[01:50:59] aort
[01:51:01] um okay okay okay what if I raised you
[01:51:04] this pyro
[01:51:05] goblet okay this has to roll only crit
[01:51:07] damage or else it's GG yeah this piece
[01:51:09] is actually kind of poop I'm skipping
[01:51:12] and
[01:51:14] it's you didn't even let the enhance no
[01:51:17] dude okay is this a hot take that I feel
[01:51:20] like the the new roll animation is so
[01:51:22] much less hype yeah it is there's no
[01:51:25] popup it's just like on the right like I
[01:51:27] know yeah yeah it doesn't show it in
[01:51:29] front of you like it doesn't have a
[01:51:30] different separate UI that's yeah that's
[01:51:33] not bad uh okay let me roll an actual
[01:51:36] piece this is boring this could be good
[01:51:38] it's all good it's all good just cuz you
[01:51:40] no one would ever use that it's only an
[01:51:42] off piece but you know we'll let it oh

[01:57:49] most most uh most DPS characters pair
[01:57:51] with finina use their attack defense or
[01:57:52] HP main stat they don't need damage
[01:57:54] bonus that it's fine unless you already
[01:57:57] have a good one which I haven't seen

[02:04:56] Main St one on the mask because you're
[02:04:59] not actually ever going to use that

[02:05:56] they didn't talk about it either they
[02:05:56] just said split scaling well if they
[02:05:58] only show the skill and it's like a
[02:05:59] little puppet thing then probably it's

[02:07:39] that's why great is it not what's up
[02:07:42] yeah that's why that piece is great 13%
[02:07:44] subset is huge
[02:07:46] right is it
[02:07:49] you're ah you don't want to give me you
[02:07:51] don't want to give me it I know you I

[02:08:02] good but but it's it's still just a y
[02:08:06] sense ah okay all right all right I'll
[02:08:09] I'll let you cope I'll let you
[02:08:14] cope just question mark [ __ ] if
[02:08:18] if you're a Shang Ling player you change
[02:08:20] her SS every three different teams
[02:08:23] exactly try play try playing melt ganu
[02:08:25] I'm a melt G mate no I'm not imagine
[02:08:28] playing m g you okay that's a good sense
[02:08:29] what else do you
[02:08:31] have or is that your your piece that I
[02:08:33] have to beat now that's the piece that I
[02:08:36] think qualifies
[02:08:38] as you know like not [ __ ] mask kind of
[02:08:42] deal you know what I'm saying let's be
[02:08:43] honest let's be honest you would use
[02:08:45] that piece more often than the attack
[02:08:47] mask that you that you
[02:08:51] um I'm being very honest I would
[02:08:54] probably use that as an offset piece my
[02:08:55] shin Ling is always on ER because she
[02:08:57] never has enough okay
[02:09:02] um but here's the thing what I'm talking
[02:09:05] about right is if we're trying to be the
[02:09:08] best because we're trying to compare our
[02:09:10] our artifacts together right the best
[02:09:12] shling builds in the world would not run
[02:09:16] energy recharge main stat
[02:09:20] I mean I mean sure
[02:09:24] sure sure I would use that on like cut I
[02:09:26] I would use it like I would use
[02:09:28] it I would use it on changling I mean it
[02:09:31] depends what changling team you're
[02:09:31] playing like some teams don't need DM
[02:09:33] right but yeah yeah but most of the time
[02:09:36] if you were to optimize around a reverse
[02:09:38] Vape Shing damage that's fair it be nice
[02:09:43] that's fair all right Mr are you saying
[02:09:44] that that piece is not worthy of your
[02:09:46] standards man I'm just upset at it it's

[02:12:38] than the one that you just rolled okay
[02:12:39] but but but but it's literally like
[02:12:41] barely one crit roll more and it's
[02:12:43] attack versus two ER and I don't even

[02:12:52] journey let me show you something if I
[02:12:54] filter My My circlets by crit rate crit

[02:12:59] and that is pain and and then it's like
[02:13:02] 28 26 25 so so so 21 is actually right
[02:13:06] there it's not even bad so so maybe you
[02:13:09] should use this collab opportunity to

[02:14:48] right but it's not bad right it's not
[02:14:52] bad but would you say say it's
[02:14:54] statistically better than the EM that I
[02:14:57] roll uh oh it's actually close kind of
[02:15:00] close I would I would rather use your
[02:15:02] ciret because em ciret is a bit better
[02:15:03] than attack
[02:15:05] goblet I mean sorry Em non circul yeah
[02:15:08] yeah it's it's slightly better if you if
[02:15:09] you take a look at the stat right like
[02:15:12] my rear is 2% more and the CV is like 2%
[02:15:15] more it's like barely better okay okay
[02:15:18] but what about this flower now this is
[02:15:19] not just barely better okay all right I
[02:15:22] you know I'll give you this one if this
[02:15:24] were an emblem it would be the perfect

[02:15:27] perfect piece for Yan okay it's not
[02:15:29] going to roll HP anyways but okay low
[02:15:32] roll but it's it's a low roll you know
[02:15:34] fine it's not just about the it's not
[02:15:36] just about the size of the
[02:15:38] Roll oh okay yeah okay mhm I'm going to
[02:15:42] throw something uh a little copium in
[02:15:43] here okay should I this you I mean no
[02:15:47] it's not bad I don't I would 56 em on

[02:24:47] recharge it doesn't have three stats on
[02:24:49] this ah but here's the thing rolling

[02:42:43] yo holy [ __ ] [ __ ] I can't believe you
[02:42:45] rolled that wow if if that last roll was
[02:42:48] crit that would have been 50 crit value
[02:42:50] I think right yeah it would have yeah
[02:42:51] that would been 30 crit damage even if
[02:42:54] you if you Minal it would not have been
[02:42:56] if you Minal it would have been I mean
[02:42:59] I'm still happy with attack
[02:43:01] 29.6 yeah I'm still happy with the
[02:43:03] attack but 10 crit rate 20 crit damage
[02:43:05] would look uh 30 crit damage would looks
[02:43:07] insane but this is still really really
[02:43:08] really really
[02:43:11] good is socks you got two Vermilion
[02:43:16] pieces for your
[02:43:19] Shia when you strong box with me dude I
[02:43:22] actually you spent two years two years
[02:43:25] and now I got better pieces that's
[02:43:28] [ __ ] wait are you saying
[02:43:30] that oh what the [ __ ] you have that I
[02:43:33] know the feathers are my best piece
[02:43:35] that's why I'm like a bit Bittersweet
[02:43:36] cuz feathers are the best piece I have I
[02:43:38] have one two but this one's better I
[02:43:40] think
[02:43:41] right it's the same crit value but plus
[02:43:44] one attack roll no this is 48 crit value
[02:43:48] wait maybe it's not better I don't know
[02:43:49] guess it depends nice pieces actually
[02:43:52] actually insane I cannot believe I just
[02:43:54] witnessed that those two pieces it's so
[02:43:57] rare to see God roll pieces because the
[02:44:00] piece that you just rolled is a
[02:44:01] technically a fire roll right it's a
[02:44:03] unicorn piece that roll all all decent
[02:44:05] stats obviously you are blessed with
[02:44:08] your feathers and you already have a 48
[02:44:10] CV feather so it's not a benefit for you
[02:44:12] but for anyone else it would have easily
[02:44:14] been a benefit still insane like I I use
[02:44:16] Vermilion on more than one character but
[02:44:17] also the you use Vermilion on more than
[02:44:20] one charactering Lenny true brother
[02:44:27] brother
[02:44:30] yeah you have mental illness
[02:44:34] yo it's
[02:44:39] good what is coming out of your mouth is
[02:44:41] the same thing as when someone Farms the
[02:44:45] H justr Quantum set okay for every
[02:44:47] single character because they're like
[02:44:49] you know it's all wait that's true I
[02:44:52] Quantum Jing Le is actually best
[02:44:54] slot okay besides that dude best set
[02:44:58] true legend has it that a hero once
[02:45:01] plucked an eagle's feather from a top

[03:02:31] that I make it doesn't like help me ever
[03:02:33] it literally has never helped it'll just
[03:02:35] say the same build that I already

[03:03:42] clap
[03:03:44] you can just type okay space
[03:03:48] clap oh what a surprise the same build
[03:03:51] but it does show that these feathers are
[03:03:53] optimized better if I need 120
[03:03:56] er um so yeah I mean that is true yeah
[03:04:00] that's true how do I unequip a weapon on
[03:04:03] this website like right now I have hom
[03:04:05] but I don't know how to make it like
[03:04:06] either weapon
[03:04:09] sign cream over the next good Vilan
[03:04:12] artifact Mr socks
[03:04:15] def HP or 100 defense z0x FL I'm waiting
[03:04:20] for it to load I'm waiting for it to
[03:04:23] load that's the build we're already on
[03:04:25] but now this is without ER but I don't
[03:04:27] know if it it literally doesn't
[03:04:29] change I have 120 oh 116 instead of 120
[03:04:33] wait what changed the damed will oh the
[03:04:35] flower wait the other flower is still
[03:04:37] better no I mean not if I need the ER
[03:04:40] though and the ER is valuable so true
[03:04:49] I need the AR I need the AR I need the
[03:04:50] AR In the Arms of an Angel wait if I
[03:04:55] click home on nothing
[03:04:59] happens edit weapon how do I remove it
[03:05:03] swap weapon how do I just put no weapon
[03:05:05] on
[03:05:12] close
[03:05:14] can I not not have a
[03:05:16] weapon and then it just tells me which
[03:05:18] one's better whatever I'll just put my
[03:05:19] weapon on why not add constraints I
[03:05:30] did well that was going to be the same
[03:05:32] thing but a different circlet
[03:05:37] anyways how about this if this is bad
[03:05:42] dude I'm not adding
[03:05:53] o reduced to just standing around how
[03:06:00] absurd why would I add
[03:06:10] this reduced to just standing around how
[03:06:14] absurd oh wow wait Optimizer actually
[03:06:16] puts both new things better but this is
[03:06:20] without chenu or no is it yeah I think
[03:06:21] that's without
[03:06:33] Chun
[03:06:35] anyways well let me see how that
[03:06:40] goes first time chatter a BD lay a hand
[03:06:43] on me you're going to you're you're
[03:06:45] going to fit right in man welcome to the
[03:06:47] welcome to the
[03:06:48] stream you're going to fit right
[03:06:54] in wait I have too much ER I want
[03:06:59] 105 oh it's using a different flower
[03:07:02] okay that's why what's my crit rate whoa
[03:07:06] sorry sorry sorry 84 a.m what the [ __ ]
[03:07:11] ew ew
[03:07:15] all
[03:07:28] good dude what the [ __ ] is
[03:07:42] this
[03:07:44] I'm going to be honest every single time
[03:07:46] I've ever eyeballed a build it's been
[03:07:48] the same as the one I generate I it's
[03:07:50] literally almost always the same the
[03:07:52] only difference is like aasha maxing
[03:07:54] versus actually maxing cuz my sh needs
[03:07:57] zero ER and needs absolutely zero uh uh
[03:08:01] uh uh uh like it doesn't need more crit
[03:08:03] rate doesn't need zero but like I get a
[03:08:05] lot from I don't want to go past 92 cuz
[03:08:07] like Abyss card and chanun gives you CR
[03:08:09] rate so like I wouldn't go to [ __ ] 98
[03:08:13] that's the difference do you have your
[03:08:14] teammates added
[03:08:16] yes reduced to just standing around how
[03:08:19] absurd how
[03:08:21] absurd reduced to just reduced to just
[03:08:24] standing
[03:08:28] around anyways sh was 15 which is insane
[03:08:33] uh on on Jade spear instead of being 15
[03:08:34] he's 20 uh granted I like Jade Shia a
[03:08:38] lot more than I like H Jia but it's fine
[03:08:44] you need more defense no I
[03:08:48] don't save the build you need to like
[03:08:51] subscribe to do that and also it's kind
[03:08:52] of
[03:08:55] weird oh you like Jade better dude who
[03:08:57] the [ __ ] pulls a Homa I'm sorry hom

[03:16:20] oh this isn't even
[03:16:23] bad this is actually not bad again then
[03:16:26] lay a hand on
[03:16:32] me that's good it's a lot of rolls never
[03:16:36] going to use it no but it's
[03:16:41] good Optimizer piece you [ __ ]
[03:16:44] act look I get it crit value is not
[03:16:46] everything I'm going to make a new video
[03:16:48] about artifacts maybe I'll talk about
[03:16:50] that I get it but I guarantee you the
[03:16:53] optimizer is not going to put that above
[03:16:54] my [ __ ] crit ones I guar it's good as
[03:16:57] like up piece but it's not good
[03:17:00] like right now for my
[03:17:03] xia look I'll add it just for you I'll
[03:17:06] add it I'll add it
[03:17:08] artifacts add new artifact boom boom
[03:17:12] boom you guys are pelling like it's
[03:17:16] going to choose that oh where am I going
[03:17:19] character shall optimize there it's
[03:17:21] literally you're just yapping it's not
[03:17:23] going to put it
[03:17:25] over this is without shenyun by the way
[03:17:28] cuz that's what Akashi uses but shenu
[03:17:29] would make attack even worse there's no
[03:17:32] way there's literally no way the feather
[03:17:34] goes to that
[03:17:38] one
[03:17:40] glueless yeah no it did
[03:17:43] see maybe if it's like Mari chose but
[03:17:47] even then
[03:17:48] like cuz cuz Vermilion gives you a lot
[03:17:50] of attack so attacks a bit
[03:18:01] worse did he get something good oh yeah
[03:18:04] yeah I did I didn't just get something
[03:18:07] good I got a lot thing
[03:18:10] good yeah yeah I did
[03:18:14] plug the right team and Buffs I did I
[03:18:16] put everything that Akashi uses the only
[03:18:18] thing I didn't do is the shenyun but
[03:18:20] shenyun wouldn't make attack better
[03:18:21] anyways shenyun would make attack
[03:18:25] worse no one asked okay sorry when is
[03:18:29] Dune three coming out how would I
[03:18:41] know
[03:18:46] a butterfly why is there no music
[03:18:47] playing H Skyward scatter I killed
[03:18:55] [Music]
[03:19:00] [Music]
[03:19:04] it how do you suain with that team do
[03:19:07] you use finina for
[03:19:08] healing
[03:19:10] uh you might have not played for a bit
[03:19:12] that's okay Shan Yun Is A Healer she's
[03:19:15] basically Jean but instead of burst
[03:19:16] healing it's overtime healing with a
[03:19:18] little bit of burst at the
[03:19:20] start so that's how you can play this
[03:19:23] team with Bennett though and then you
[03:19:25] would ask that question and I would say
[03:19:26] you make your Bennett go on like song of
[03:19:28] days past or something with healing and
[03:19:29] you build for
[03:19:31] healing but she's a Healer question mark
[03:19:35] yes that is why shenyun is good at worst
[03:19:38] she's Jean at best she's broken she is a
[03:19:42] the Healer how do you not know
[03:19:44] [Music]
[03:19:51] [Music]
[03:19:54] this yeah Bennett's good in the team
[03:19:58] too life Falls

[03:23:56] this wasn't what popped up when the
[03:23:58] sponsor typed exclamation Mar genin so

[03:39:12] Tuesday you're getting crit yep that's
[03:39:15] how I got my crit have you reacted to
[03:39:17] the lesbian Post in o0 X I don't what I
[03:39:21] don't think so 30 mon still axe
[03:39:25] picker I'm too gullible this is like
[03:39:28] this is literally like three years ago C
[03:39:31] by the way Zio perfect Sands yep it's
[03:39:34] [ __ ]
[03:39:35] time it is time
[03:39:38] again cuz it happens in every gotta game
[03:39:42] every
[03:39:47] time oh what is this Zio shows us a
[03:39:51] trick to getting perfect artifact rolls
[03:39:53] three years ago hey what's going on guys
[03:39:55] Zio here uh we're just going to do uh a
[03:39:57] bug abuse right now so there's basically
[03:39:58] if you stand next to Xiao who's my
[03:40:00] husband there's a way to get every
[03:40:02] single good roll on an artifact so what
[03:40:04] you want to do is you want to get an
[03:40:05] artifact with good stats ideally crit
[03:40:07] damage and crit rate and you put a plus
[03:40:09] 20 in next to sh right so if you do that
[03:40:12] actually let's let's put more than just
[03:40:13] that all this stuff in here you're
[03:40:16] actually guaranteed keep in mind I had
[03:40:18] three 40K Mora and look at how few
[03:40:21] artifacts I had I was actually
[03:40:23] struggling do a bug right now so there's
[03:40:28] that's it that's all my well I had this
[03:40:31] but like basically if you stand next to
[03:40:32] xia who's my H you're actually
[03:40:34] guaranteed to get only crit uh damage
[03:40:36] and crit rate upgrades so watch
[03:40:39] this
[03:40:43] oh
[03:40:45] true 50
[03:40:49] CV yeah [ __ ] it look at the artifact

[03:54:42] just that account used in the video and
[03:54:44] he they also watch my stream or my
[03:54:45] videos option two is that this is

[04:03:30] for like months now it's been in my
[04:03:32] editors DMS for like literally like 5
[04:03:34] months I've been saying I'm going to
[04:03:35] make it uh I think I saw recently think
[04:03:38] seie made a video like that shout out to
[04:03:39] her I'm just I'm I'm saying this so that
[04:03:41] it's not like I I don't want to like
[04:03:42] make a video when I see someone else
[04:03:43] makes a video it always [ __ ] with me
[04:03:45] when I'm like making a video and then so
[04:03:46] I just want to uh I also want to say the
[04:03:50] slice strong video is going to be out
[04:03:52] probably within a month I'll try to
[04:03:54] actually upload it also the verdict
[04:03:56] incident is done I just need a thumbnail
[04:03:57] but I need to like pose for a thumbnail
[04:03:59] I've never done that before so it's it's
[04:04:01] going to take like a year but the video
[04:04:02] is actually done it is a banger it is a
[04:04:05] banger a month copium no no no no no it
[04:04:08] will be it will be it will be uh
[04:04:10] hopefully the whole thing doesn't get
[04:04:11] yed but we will upload
[04:04:13] it
[04:04:15] um
[04:04:19] yeah sliced benched no he's not benched
[04:04:23] we will upload
[04:04:25] it and uh yeah a bunch of content coming

[04:04:33] we'll see
[04:04:36] true oh also
[04:04:39] uh leaking this but I think I I don't
[04:04:42] think it's a secret
[04:04:44] uh yeah it's not a secret Pon asked me
[04:04:48] if I wanted to do the four shows against
[04:04:50] everything you guys know how he does
[04:04:52] those videos do you guys think I should
[04:04:54] do it you think that's a good idea we
[04:04:55] can like I won't make it into video but
[04:04:57] he would I assume it would just be
[04:04:58] stream content I would stream it and
[04:05:00] then he'd make a video probably yeah all
[04:05:03] right
[04:05:05] bet all bet we'll probably do it then uh
[04:05:08] maybe this week maybe
[04:05:09] next uh yeah they pretty good content
