[00:54:40] me okay one
[00:54:42] second hi Mr strammer I'm curious about
[00:54:46] your hopes for Claren if any on a scale
[00:54:49] of four star version official to Five
[00:54:51] Star version of yay what do you
[00:54:55] imagine
[00:54:57] okay you're trying to stun loock me
[00:54:58] because you're comparing chlorin to
[00:55:00] either a what the [ __ ] is this I
[00:55:03] filtered my eem you dumb [ __ ] sorry
[00:55:05] sorry um dude this is so [ __ ] I D like I
[00:55:10] guess I have to do minor
[00:55:15] aics
[00:55:17] anyways
[00:55:25] um
[00:55:36] anyways
[00:55:38] uh I think they have to do a thing I
[00:55:41] think genin impact does this thing where
[00:55:43] characters that are like especially
[00:55:46] hyped they kind of have to make them
[00:55:48] good you know so I have faith in Claren
[00:55:51] that's not really true some of them suck
[00:55:52] dick but for the most
[00:55:55] part so I have faith um also it's kind
[00:55:59] of
[00:56:01] impossible de clueless well did they
[00:56:03] made DEA standard I don't know I mean de
[00:56:05] should be better but like was she even
[00:56:07] that hyped I like her but did I don't
[00:56:09] know I don't know maybe
[00:56:12] maybe whatever I Electro in general is
[00:56:15] pretty cracked she was so hyped oh well
[00:56:19] I don't know what they did free her
[00:56:25] man
[00:56:37] Electro isn't that great right now okay
[00:56:39] you okay this is either you are either
[00:56:42] trolling me so that I get stun locked or
[00:56:44] you Electro has never been bad I don't
[00:56:46] give a [ __ ] if you're one of the oh
[00:56:48] Electro was bad before dendro go suck a
[00:56:50] [ __ ] Electro in taser has always been
[00:56:52] good and then dendro made it six times
[00:56:54] better Electro's just good I'm sorry
[00:56:56] Electro's just good I'm sorry it just is
[00:56:58] Electro's just good I'm sorry Electro's
[00:57:00] good so it's hard for an electro
[00:57:02] character to be well okay Electro
[00:57:03] characters can be bad but Electro I have
[00:57:06] faith in Electro characters especially
[00:57:08] if they're on field I'm sorry now I
[00:57:11] don't know anything about choren we
[00:57:12] don't know anything about her kit but
[00:57:14] the odds are she's going to be on field
[00:57:16] because why the [ __ ] would they make a
[00:57:17] such a front-loaded character an off
[00:57:20] Fielder Dory exists if okay Dory is just
[00:57:24] bad design cuz she has like eight of up
[00:57:26] time but if there was no if there was no
[00:57:28] other option I would probably play like
[00:57:31] if K I don't know I dory's just [ __ ]
[00:57:34] design though but like in general if
[00:57:36] Dory just had better up time she'd be
[00:57:41] [Music]
[00:57:43] good cuz do you understand dude she
[00:57:46] applies Electro up to once every 4
[00:57:49] seconds that is stupidly good but it it
[00:57:52] it has a [ __ ] 8sec downtime so what
[00:57:54] are you going to do for 8 Seconds
[00:58:02] nothing
[00:58:07] yeah a lot of hard characters are on are
[00:58:10] off field like y de yolan bad take okay
[00:58:13] that's not even a bad take because Yan's
[00:58:15] a bow character so they would have made
[00:58:16] her a [ __ ] charge shotter yeah that's
[00:58:17] cringe nice try thank God Starfield yay
[00:58:20] uh can onfield and so can DEA because
[00:58:22] her burst is literally trying to force
[00:58:23] her on field so a bad take
[00:58:30] okay I don't know
[00:58:32] dude I'm just going to take this as a
[00:58:34] son I've been playing genin for so long
[00:58:36] that I have a feeling for what character
[00:58:38] looks on field and what character
[00:58:39] doesn't Maybe I'm Wrong maybe this is
[00:58:42] entirely copium but I feel like I can
[00:58:44] tell who they're going to make on field
[00:58:46] I don't know maybe I'm wrong black socks
[00:58:48] or white socks or no socks or two socks
[00:58:51] or one
[00:58:55] socks
[00:58:57] like let's say chori right you look at
[00:58:59] her you're not like okay this maybe they
[00:59:01] make her a DPS but I wouldn't be like
[00:59:02] she has to be a DPS but like choren I
[00:59:05] feel like what like no dude how would
[00:59:08] they I mean maybe maybe maybe like but
[00:59:12] like like like okay we saw some trailers
[00:59:14] where her Electro iron sting was electro
[00:59:17] which means it gives me the idea that
[00:59:18] she'll be able to infuse with Electro I
[00:59:20] don't know there aren't even leaks about
[00:59:21] her so there's literally no way for me
[00:59:23] to know I'm just saying it looks like
[00:59:24] she's like like going to be able to do
[00:59:26] that whereas you look at
[00:59:30] like a character that can summon [ __ ] or
[00:59:33] have all field presents you're like oh
[00:59:34] okay there's off field presents maybe
[00:59:37] though we don't know maybe maybe her
[00:59:39] [ __ ] skill summons a mini chlorin
[00:59:41] that like shoots [ __ ]
[00:59:45] lightning Uncle Z dude what are you
[00:59:48] yapping about memory quick swap maybe
[00:59:52] you Ain messing
[00:59:55] around
[00:59:57] so y but actually good dude dude d d
[01:00:00] dude stop stop stop stop what are you
[01:00:02] trying to do to me Y is good
[01:00:09] stop grow grow grow grow grow grow
[01:00:24] May
[01:00:29] okay
[01:00:45] anyways Mr socks it's my birthday today
[01:00:48] I'm finally legal what should I do with
[01:00:50] my why would you say it like that
[01:00:54] alive
[01:00:56] enlist in the
[01:00:58] Army I think my
[01:01:01] scenario
[01:01:08] counter
[01:01:10] me is cryo worse than Gio at Zio dude
[01:01:15] are you like like like like so you know
[01:01:17] when the teacher says there are no such
[01:01:19] thing as bad questions yeah the teacher
[01:01:21] was [ __ ] lying that's a bad question
[01:01:23] that's a dumb question hey is is cryo
[01:01:27] worse than no element you you answer
[01:01:32] me freeze is really
[01:01:44] good super conduct is
[01:01:46] cope reverse melt can work freeze is
[01:01:50] really
[01:01:52] good and fridge is kind of a meme but
[01:01:55] like kind of does something kind
[01:02:03] of whoa what are you doing sorry unch
[01:02:13] me freeze works like one out of 10
[01:02:16] abysses yeah but what's nice is
[01:02:20] um well when it works it's broken and
[01:02:22] when it doesn't like it's like for
[01:02:24] example let me show you something
[01:02:27] uh a lot of the
[01:02:30] times it's not like like okay let's say
[01:02:32] here you can like freeze these things
[01:02:34] really good like if you can freeze these
[01:02:36] which you can it would be broken like it
[01:02:39] is broken same with like these things
[01:02:41] right where freeze is like really good
[01:02:42] and then against this you want to
[01:02:44] [ __ ] jump off a cliff
[01:02:46] right
[01:02:48] yeah but you can just either swap to
[01:02:50] monoc cryo or you can still like be fine
[01:02:53] like it's not like that bad especially
[01:02:55] if you're Hydro option isn't like like
[01:02:57] actually does damage like finina or some
[01:03:00] [ __ ] it's still fine um we could try the
[01:03:03] team actually but uh also I
[01:03:07] think an interesting thing you can do if
[01:03:10] you're
[01:03:11] playing how did you misspell
[01:03:14] plsis uh we don't have that emote by the
[01:03:16] way an interesting thing you can
[01:03:18] do uh with let's say freeze aaka is
[01:03:21] unironically if you're playing finina
[01:03:24] you could do Mar chose
[01:03:26] if you're not um if the enemy can't be
[01:03:29] frozen because if the enemy can't be
[01:03:30] frozen this gives you 20 crit rate but
[01:03:32] this gives you
[01:03:34] 36
[01:03:36] um yeah I mean you lose Crow damage
[01:03:38] bonus
[01:03:40] but yeah
[01:03:43] know so you can make it a bit more
[01:03:48] consistent wait is it did Fang enable
[01:03:53] ptosis I still don't see it I don't
[01:03:58] how many cats but no
[01:03:59] Sands this is the worst emote I have

[01:32:44] this water not drained wait you have to
[01:32:47] drain the water oh [ __ ] maybe that's
[01:32:52] why read the tablet hints I did and I
[01:32:56] lit up all the things I lit them all up
[01:32:58] with
[01:33:04] fire I read the tablet it was like light

[01:33:36] light three and then leave this one
[01:33:37] empty but then when I go there it's like

[01:33:41] part is that is that like top right like
[01:33:42] how the [ __ ] would I know and then over
[01:33:45] there there's only like one square I
[01:33:47] assumed it was that it was like okay see
[01:33:49] I left one empty but was that the wrong
[01:33:51] one see like I did this purpose but

[01:40:20] [ __ ]
[01:40:22] idiot

[01:40:31] herach solved this puzzle in one
[01:40:35] minute wait I just forgot what I saw cuz
[01:40:38] I have the memory of a goldfish okay top
[01:40:39] right was not lit fam wait so top right
[01:40:42] was
[01:40:45] unlit and
[01:40:51] then top left right one right top left
[01:40:55] one
[01:40:55] right wait does that mean this one or
[01:40:58] does that mean this
[01:41:01] one
[01:41:03] wait wait wait wait chill I'm not dumb I
[01:41:06] promise I'm not
[01:41:22] dumb
[01:41:27] wait I had this wait no I
[01:41:29] didn't
[01:41:45] what that doesn't even make sense you
[01:41:49] have to combine them
[01:41:51] oh wait but I kind of I thought that was
[01:41:53] what I was doing I guess it wasn't oh
[01:41:56] you like put them all together in like a
[01:41:57] picture and then whatever is empty there
[01:41:59] is what's empty so like that would be
[01:42:02] like the yeah but that's what I was
[01:42:03] doing wait that's literally what I was
[01:42:05] doing it's inverted oh that's why yeah
[01:42:10] cuz cuz this one was supposed to be
[01:42:11] unlit but in the video it was I'm dude
[01:42:15] I'm yeah it's the opposite so if this
[01:42:17] was unlit that means it's lit right and
[01:42:20] then these were lit fam and then this
[01:42:22] one was unlit
[01:42:38] wait well I forget which ones were

[02:05:24] anyways [ __ ] builds okay you are coping
[02:05:27] you are actually coping look at this
[02:05:29] look at this look at this sparkle 166
[02:05:32] speed and then bro 162 which means I can
[02:05:34] play them both in the same team with my
[02:05:35] blade true so suck my balls the only
[02:05:39] problem with Aria is um okay this is the
[02:05:42] the main problem so I usually run this
[02:05:44] right uh where is it I usually run this
[02:05:46] 29 crit damage on broken Kel which is
[02:05:49] great um and I usually go broken k kill
[02:05:52] right the problem is I don't have a
[02:05:55] single broken kill piece with speed so
[02:05:57] in order to have 160 speed I need to go
[02:06:00] [ __ ] offset but it doesn't matter
[02:06:03] it's it's it's 10
[02:06:05] damage so
[02:06:10] sag do you want to the Forgotten Hall do
[02:06:12] you want to enter the Forgotten
[02:06:20] Hall
[02:06:28] just go 156 okay I'm a nice person I
[02:06:31] promise but if you guys start talking
[02:06:33] about speed break points all stream like
[02:06:34] you always do I will start Banning
[02:06:36] people stop it I do not give a [ __ ] okay
[02:06:39] I get it 160 breakpoint 133 point4
[02:06:42] breakpoint 171 I don't care I don't care
[02:06:45] stop it okay speed is important but
[02:06:48] trying to hit a break point so you can
[02:06:49] get one cycle isn't the everything in
[02:06:51] your life okay [ __ ] you also I already
[02:06:53] built all my well not all but the
[02:06:55] characters I plan on using dude my
[02:06:57] inator had I had to [ __ ] throw all
[02:07:00] his speed out he had 134 I have to throw
[02:07:02] all of it
[02:07:03] out
[02:07:05] um because [ __ ] Sparkle just jumps
[02:07:08] him up to her so I don't know my builds
[02:07:10] are a bit scuffed because of that cuz
[02:07:12] I'm using Sparkle but whatever that's

[02:13:44] important basic on
[02:13:50] her
[02:13:56] would the back light cone be good for
[02:13:57] Aron so um from what we know about her
[02:14:01] actually okay what exactly do we know
[02:14:03] about her I'm I'm going to say from what
[02:14:05] we know about
[02:14:07] her I can't see an argument for using it
[02:14:12] on her instead of on your support
[02:14:15] like you
[02:14:17] know on
[02:14:20] Pila
[02:14:24] there's already videos
[02:14:29] oh wait
[02:14:33] really what's her name
[02:14:41] acaron oh yeah there is okay cool mine
[02:14:43] will be out in a few
[02:14:45] hours continue it's just being edited
[02:14:48] right now but it's done okay cool we can
[02:14:50] talk about it yeah uh yeah have fun if
[02:14:52] you're free to play she's good but like
[02:14:55] you kind of need a likeone that doesn't
[02:14:58] suck all
[02:15:05] good Veri seaon prawn actor
[02:15:14] Troon few hours liar I'm not a liar do
[02:15:19] we still have the upper hand
[02:15:27] yeah is good night
[02:15:30] s okay
[02:15:33] look good night and sleep well is really
[02:15:36] good however if you have it
[02:15:40] S1 it's still fine but like the
[02:15:44] difference between her L cone and that
[02:15:45] is like night and day like it's like
[02:15:48] it's like for a character it's really
[02:15:51] like trying to sell the ly cone even
[02:15:53] compared to other character signatures
[02:15:56] it is very much trying to sell
[02:15:58] it that's all I'm going to say now is
[02:16:00] that a Like You could argue like I don't
[02:16:03] like when a character doesn't have good
[02:16:04] free to play options it bothers me but
[02:16:06] it's also a way to like vertically
[02:16:08] invest very highly with her cuz there's
[02:16:09] a lot of really good upgrades E1 is like
[02:16:12] no one cares E2 is really good ly con's

[02:18:33] have been out like two hours ago or an
[02:18:35] hour ago but um I didn't
[02:18:41] know I didn't know content creators were
[02:18:43] allowed to make videos before the
[02:18:44] servers out I don't [ __ ] that's not a
[02:18:47] thing in genin so apparently we
[02:18:49] are um
[02:18:55] allegedly I don't know I mean I'll
[02:18:56] explain in the video so uh it should be
[02:18:59] out in a bit what is this lightning ice
[02:19:03] okay thank [ __ ] I can play blade
[02:19:14] again
[02:19:19] who all
[02:19:25] blade is so hot I can't take it dude you
[02:19:28] you dude what are you yapping about but
[02:19:30] yeah uh uh yeah does that hurt you'll
[02:19:35] see It'll be out soon
[02:19:40] um exist what I can say is I I I played
[02:19:44] her for a while not definitive of the
[02:19:46] live servers though things might change
[02:19:48] and um relax
[02:19:51] every pedal in life all will be swept
[02:19:53] away by it like okay after one rotation
[02:19:57] I was like this is pure biased by the
[02:19:59] way but I was like holy [ __ ] this isn't
[02:20:01] fair like that was my
[02:20:03] reaction but I'm the watch my video when
[02:20:06] it's out I I go into more depth about it
[02:20:09] that's all I'm going to say for
[02:20:19] now
[02:20:22] tempted to whale don't be because like
[02:20:25] if you have jinglu like you are you're
[02:20:28] chilling or a good damage dealer
[02:20:34] memories I don't
[02:20:40] think
[02:20:42] etal Destiny isn't um wait I'm I don't
[02:20:46] want to Auto Battle sorry let me just
[02:20:47] check really
[02:20:49] fast
[02:20:55] uh boom
[02:21:07] boom stand
[02:21:13] still Tiding
[02:21:18] man relax
[02:21:22] all will be swept away by the
[02:21:30] wind okay
[02:21:40] yeah I was just checking if there's
[02:21:42] anything I can or can't say but
[02:21:44] everything's going to be in the video so
[02:21:46] uh I'll just let make you guys watch the
[02:21:48] [ __ ] video but yeah I like I'll just
[02:21:51] say very excited for her but don't get
[02:21:53] baited to pull for her if you have a
[02:21:55] good DPS because there's a lot of
[02:21:57] characters that are like quote unquote
[02:21:58] meta and a lot of them aren't
[02:22:00] necessarily better than the
[02:22:02] others um and it also depends what
[02:22:05] content you're doing I will say acaron
[02:22:07] because we know I'm going to say we know
[02:22:10] from other people's videos that are out
[02:22:11] now we know that she's like can break uh
[02:22:16] toughness or can break enemies
[02:22:18] regardless of their type right they're
[02:22:21] always super effective makes her pretty
[02:22:23] pretty good like
[02:22:25] universally however her freeo playay
[02:22:27] lyone option is actual garbage I don't
[02:22:30] think I've ever recorded a weapon like a
[02:22:33] lyone section for a character or a
[02:22:35] weapon section for a genon character
[02:22:36] where I straight up don't mention a free
[02:22:38] to- play option and I think that's the
[02:22:40] case for her outside of good night sleep
[02:22:41] well which isn't technically freeto
[02:22:43] play weakness but not resistance yeah
[02:22:46] yeah I didn't say resistance did I she
[02:22:48] has res pen on her alt though there's
[02:22:50] res pen 20% I
[02:22:52] think I think it's
[02:22:57] 20t and
[02:22:59] awaken all things human
[02:23:10] creation
[02:23:12] yeah like usually usually what it is
[02:23:14] with theiles it's like it's it's like
[02:23:17] you're typing like aware if you don't
[02:23:19] have [ __ ] uh pila's lyone like um
[02:23:22] tutorial cuz you're like [ __ ] I'm [ __ ]
[02:23:25] but with uh with
[02:23:27] her
[02:23:31] yeah that's silver wolf well it's oh
[02:23:34] silver wolf like I said paila well it's
[02:23:35] always on Pila cuz if you're not running
[02:23:37] it on Pila what are you doing with your
[02:23:38] life sorry that was toxic we're going to
[02:23:40] do
[02:23:41] this your end approaches receive
[02:23:44] Divinity dude P's [ __ ] broken I'm
[02:23:46] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry she's [ __ ]
[02:23:48] broken I don't care
[02:23:52] lend me your strength a blade Knows No
[02:23:55] Mercy I want to kill this guy but I kind
[02:23:57] of don't feel like attacking the Trotter
[02:23:59] am I dumb if I don't attack the Trotter
[02:24:01] probably that paradise may be
[02:24:04] unreachable I still don't want to attack
[02:24:05] the Trotter whatever [ __ ] the troter I
[02:24:07] know I should I know I should but [ __ ]
[02:24:09] the
[02:24:10] troter I want to AOE him oh I did cool
[02:24:15] Eternal Dead
[02:24:18] return shouldn't peel up be E4 actually
[02:24:20] be great for acon great question and the
[02:24:22] answer is no now yes E4 gives another
[02:24:25] debuff but you can run resolution shines
[02:24:27] as Pearl sweat on Luca's back whatever
[02:24:29] the [ __ ] it's called and then apply a
[02:24:30] debuff with your normal attack on top of
[02:24:32] also applying a debuff with your
[02:24:33] ultimate there you go consistent
[02:24:36] debuffs I'll go easy but you can if you
[02:24:38] have E4 you can also get a debuff
[02:24:40] through your
[02:24:42] skill let's you find the answer you show
[02:24:45] your one debuff for Action yes that is
[02:24:46] why you normal attack before alting if
[02:24:48] you Al and you have a resolution it'll
[02:24:49] only apply one even though it applies
[02:24:51] two but it only counts as one but if you
[02:24:52] normal attack before you ult then you
[02:24:54] can apply one and then apply another
[02:24:58] truee this battle is lend me your
[02:25:01] strength for your we've entered the
[02:25:04] storm to guard and defend BS on sustain
[02:25:07] wealth I okay listen this is going to be
[02:25:11] investment bias to the max but I had so
[02:25:14] much fun with it I okay I like you asked
[02:25:17] me that yesterday I'll be like copium
[02:25:19] you're coping I dude I had so much fun
[02:25:22] with it but but I don't recommend it
[02:25:25] okay it's gonna be like clickbait damage
[02:25:28] I think I did when I removed the Healer
[02:25:30] from my team I did like a million or
[02:25:31] like 999k I'll probably get a million
[02:25:33] for the video which is like clickbait
[02:25:35] damage no one cares but
[02:25:37] like if you're not high investment and
[02:25:39] you're just like trying to clear I don't
[02:25:41] recommend replacing your healer with
[02:25:43] wealth but I did it and I cleared and it
[02:25:46] was really [ __ ] fun so you can but
[02:25:50] again more in the
[02:25:52] video Let's Play for a while let's play
[02:25:56] sorry I'm not going to I'm not going to
[02:25:57] elaborate on it cuz like yeah I'm not
[02:26:00] going to elaborate on it
[02:26:02] yet Paradise it for me so real thing and
[02:26:06] very much viable POG spin yeah but it's
[02:26:09] also
[02:26:12] like lend me your strength yeah I have
[02:26:16] enough respect I have enough respect for
[02:26:18] my audience to mention it so that they
[02:26:21] know how it works but also understanding
[02:26:24] that like if I'm just trying to clear do
[02:26:26] I want to have to [ __ ] poo sweat to
[02:26:29] with no healer maybe I mean it's it's
[02:26:31] good it's like [ __ ] it I like it but
[02:26:34] if you're not like um like kind of try
[02:26:36] Harding and know what you're doing it's
[02:26:37] a bit
[02:26:40] annoying but yeah I like welth
[02:26:49] so
[02:26:54] lend me your strength a blade knows no I
[02:26:57] think I I mean I do think I auto battled
[02:26:58] with the team by the way I think I tried

[02:41:14] accessible but honestly I guess it kind
[02:41:17] of depends well it is cuz everyone like
[02:41:19] you have paila probably and you can
[02:41:22] choose g a fan for free and you can get
[02:41:24] Lynx as a
[02:41:26] Healer um or like the other dude the new
[02:41:29] one the new
[02:41:34] fourstar but your Lyon option may be a
[02:41:36] little copage
[02:41:39] strength Gallagher yeah Gallagher gives
[02:41:41] it's not just one debuff it's two
[02:41:42] ultimate and enhanced basic that
[02:41:44] paradise May savor it for me but
[02:41:47] Gallagher has no Clans that is healing
[02:41:49] makes you want to [ __ ] eat a wet
[02:41:51] noodle it's not bad it's not like bad
[02:41:53] healing but it's like yeah I don't know
[02:41:55] it's okay it's okay but there's no like
[02:41:57] cleanse so it's like a little oh I mean
[02:42:00] with eidolons yeah
[02:42:01] sure I guess that I guess that's fair
[02:42:03] it's a fourstar you might get the idolon
[02:42:05] that is fair that is fair that's a fair
[02:42:12] point but uh do you know what else can
[02:42:15] give you a debuff trend of the market or
[02:42:18] whatever the [ __ ] it's called the L cone
[02:42:19] with topaz

[02:43:48] Sparkle and then I looked at my
[02:43:50] characters I'm like I don't want to
[02:43:51] actually as Black Swan or

[02:45:37] want some it's blueberries and
[02:45:39] blackberries dude blackberries
[02:45:41] blackberries get a bad rep cuz if like
[02:45:43] sometimes they're sour and they're not
[02:45:44] ripe but if they're ripe and sweet
[02:45:46] they're actually like
[02:45:47] insane these are like I got good black R
[02:45:50] I got lucky good
[02:45:59] RNG like if you don't know you don't
[02:46:01] know like if you um if you haven't had
[02:46:05] like insane blackberries you don't know
[02:46:06] what I'm saying but like top tier
[02:46:08] blackberries are top tier but overall I
[02:46:11] rank them third it's blueberry or
[02:46:12] raspberry first I don't know I think I
[02:46:15] like raspberry stuff more but I like
[02:46:16] blueberries alone more and and then it's

[03:15:59] wrong with
[03:16:12] [Music]
[03:16:15] that
[03:16:20] there's an epidemic of no ER ropes in
[03:16:23] this
[03:16:25] household 29 crit damage on [ __ ] Ting
[03:16:28] Yun that is
[03:16:33] useful okay we should be
[03:16:45] fine
[03:16:48] let's go all right I'm ready ready
[03:16:50] ready ready
[03:17:03] ready is Ting Yun the Bennett is
[03:17:06] silverwolf the kazua they don't look
[03:17:10] happy to see
[03:17:11] us
[03:17:15] no
[03:17:19] if silverwolf was the free
[03:17:21] fourstar well not free but let's say
[03:17:23] free fourstar and paila was the banner
[03:17:26] five star you would all know pila's true
[03:17:31] strength paila is the goat
[03:17:36] sound make a wish does that
[03:17:43] hurt existence is no no no
[03:17:49] oh stand still every padal all will be
[03:17:53] swept away by the
[03:17:58] wind paila equal official silver wolf
[03:18:02] equal y moo wait that's actually the
[03:18:05] first accurate one I've ever seen that
[03:18:07] is the first accurate one I've seen in
[03:18:09] my life Destiny all right you
[03:18:15] win may as well kill them
[03:18:18] all I'm scared cuz silver wolf is good
[03:18:21] and yay is good but I think there's an
[03:18:23] overlap between people that would say
[03:18:24] silver wolf is better than paila and P
[03:18:26] that would say Y is better than Fel so I
[03:18:28] actually think you're

[03:40:02] thinks I'm a whale S4 on Kafka S2 eyes
[03:40:05] of the prey on Black Swan you probably
[03:40:07] have a better light cone okay and I
[03:40:09] still I like like so stop holding me to
[03:40:11] some higher standard okay okay chat hear
[03:40:13] me out you know how literally there's
[03:40:15] like like no freeo playay option and
[03:40:17] it's like forada if you're running like
[03:40:18] Black Swan or Kafka or like [ __ ] Loop
[03:40:21] if you have welt but like you shouldn't
[03:40:23] be [ __ ] using or like silver wolf but
[03:40:25] like this is co okay I have a theory
[03:40:27] okay let's say you don't have good night
[03:40:28] sleep PA right you don't have like w
[03:40:29] Leon or any of the good ones right
[03:40:32] here's my
[03:40:33] theory what if dude dude hear me out
[03:40:37] what if you just run a high base attack
[03:40:40] lone from another [ __ ] path [ __ ] it
[03:40:43] dude [ __ ] it like just just get the base
[03:40:45] attack [ __ ] it dude [ __ ] it like like
[03:40:47] what if you just do that what if you
[03:40:48] just slam this on her what if that's the
[03:40:54] play dude you got to be [ __ ] up if you
[03:40:56] think I'm running Loop I'm
[03:41:03] sorry you can't I mean you can you just
[03:41:06] don't get the
[03:41:14] effect
[03:41:17] dude I'm
[03:41:19] cooking I mean I'm not actually cooking
[03:41:22] like don't actually do that
[03:41:31] but someone Cal
[03:41:42] that let me AO about
[03:41:44] this
[03:41:52] etal in lunar
[03:41:58] flame blade
[03:42:01] ofon
[03:42:03] um wa what is the new Lon again actually
[03:42:06] I forgot your end approaches I know the
[03:42:08] hero one what's the what's the memory
[03:42:11] chaos one what's it called is it it's
[03:42:13] show time or is that the harmony one
[03:42:16] it's
[03:42:23] showtime the Dead
[03:42:27] return oh yeah dude what dude dude in
[03:42:30] lunar
[03:42:32] flame
[03:42:37] this fail how are you
[03:42:42] in do you know what gives acon a debuff
[03:42:45] she can apply her alt yes but you know
[03:42:47] what else her signature sorry sorry so
[03:42:50] it it is hard to like inflict the the
[03:42:52] the consistent debuffs it's just her alt
[03:42:54] which will be every x amount of
[03:42:57] turns um and
[03:43:00] then when the we's effect hit rate is
[03:43:02] 80% or
[03:43:05] higher you know what actually do that I
[03:43:08] think you should build 80 hit rate on
[03:43:09] acon to just to get this 20 attack
[03:43:11] that's actually what you should do
[03:43:13] that's what you should do
[03:43:16] yeah so uh let's pretend this Lon
[03:43:17] doesn't exist okay okay L
[03:43:21] flame so this is 6% damage every time
[03:43:24] you ult
[03:43:29] basically fail to send
[03:43:35] you the Dead
[03:43:44] return
[03:43:48] this is for Black Swan man yeah yeah but
[03:43:50] they they were they weren't talking
[03:43:51] about Black Swan I don't
[03:43:52] think I'm not making fun of the ly cone
[03:43:55] I was talking about for acaron I was uh
[03:43:57] whoa why did I start whoa why am I
[03:44:00] lagging what
[03:44:03] the wel LC wel lone is the the the best
[03:44:08] of the worst you get me it's like the
[03:44:10] it's it's it's it's cope like it's it's
[03:44:12] good because it's it's not good but it's
[03:44:13] not bad it's like if you have no better
[03:44:15] option you can use it it's not like
[03:44:18] great but it at least gives you stats
[03:44:21] like at least it gives you
[03:44:23] stats so it's
[03:44:27] okay um it's not your go-to choice
[03:44:30] there's better options but if you like
[03:44:31] there's no freetop playay option so the
[03:44:33] only thing you can technically get if
[03:44:36] you aren't swiping is if you have this
[03:44:39] you can get uh
[03:44:42] this but yes I assume you'll have good
[03:44:45] night sleep well so it's fine but um
[03:44:48] yeah what if I only have formada in the
[03:44:51] nicest way possible consider jinglu I'm
[03:44:54] kidding pull for who you like like but
[03:44:56] but like okay actually you can adjust
[03:44:59] your team to make Fato work if you run
[03:45:02] someone who has chalk or Wier like Kafka
[03:45:04] or Black Swan or something uh and those
[03:45:06] teams work by the way for mod can be
[03:45:13] fine um I considered or tried I guess uh
[03:45:17] Black Swan in a ratio team as a kind of
[03:45:20] cope Pila because when she skills it
[03:45:21] shreds defense and she has like debuffs
[03:45:23] right uh and then there's her oh skill I
[03:45:25] clicked on alt but skill is here um I
[03:45:28] mean there's also the alt that makes
[03:45:29] more damage but well that's from dots
[03:45:31] but anyways it's it's mostly this it's
[03:45:34] okay like Black Swan is fine um you
[03:45:36] could also do her with Black Swan and
[03:45:38] Kafka and then you have like a honestly
[03:45:40] a pretty decent
[03:45:42] team but
[03:45:43] yeah
[03:45:46] I'll have a like lone R ranking math for
[03:45:49] the guide like I'm not going to be like
[03:45:51] I I have the general ranking in my head
[03:45:53] right now but I'll have the ranking for
[03:45:54] that guide
[03:45:58] so but the signature is is pretty
[03:46:00] considerably better than the next best
[03:46:02] thing it's like 10 to 15% and then like
[03:46:04] 30% better than some of the like cope
[03:46:07] options or 25 to
[03:46:12] 30 do we want to do pure
[03:46:18] ition day one guide maybe I already
[03:46:21] recorded a full guy or not full like
[03:46:23] half of it because there's some stuff I
[03:46:24] don't know yet so I wouldn't talk about
[03:46:26] that but then I um I was like wait I
[03:46:29] should probably do a review first I
[03:46:30] record a full review that one's done
[03:46:31] it'll be uploaded today uh tomorrow
[03:46:37] morning how SS you'll see well I mean
[03:46:39] it's already out you know aren't you the
[03:46:42] moan guy no it's not
[03:46:43] me
[03:46:59] wait I actually forget what her E1
[03:47:02] does
[03:47:03] um oh yeah I mean that's pretty
[03:47:06] good I think that helps a lot actually
[03:47:08] if you have
[03:47:11] that yeah that's really
[03:47:13] good
[03:47:30] that only affects her damage question
[03:47:32] mark no cuz it says res right so it
[03:47:34] should affect
[03:47:35] everything right have their res
[03:47:39] reduced oh wait when Alon is active in
[03:47:41] battle wait never mind wait no yeah on
[03:47:43] yeah yeah so it's everything yeah
[03:47:45] why am I second guessing yeah it's
[03:47:46] everything uh pure fiction where are you
[03:47:49] no what the [ __ ] that's forgotten
[03:47:53] Hall pale flame wait let me claim this
[03:47:55] what what time is it 1:30 oh we have
[03:47:59] time you need a shock proc no because uh

[03:48:07] everything with her
[03:48:13] Alt
[03:48:18] do you have access to the Creator server

[03:50:48] DM I hate jard he is so useless I don't
[03:50:52] understand why anyone would would like
[03:50:54] him by choice all he is is an attractive
[03:50:56] sweet caring sexy sweaty muscular hot
[03:50:59] jock type that reminds me all too much
[03:51:01] of the feelings I used to get from
[03:51:02] watching the football team in high
[03:51:03] school how could anyone appreciate him
[03:51:05] when all he does is bring a big Shield I
[03:51:06] was able to clear simulated Universe one
[03:51:08] with no shielder and people tell me that
[03:51:10] I need a defensive uh unit yes I died to
[03:51:13] world one over 20 times but I wasn't
[03:51:14] trying to be fair why would I need a
[03:51:16] shielder my team of sampo hook D hung
[03:51:19] tting
[03:51:20] Yun uh if my team is one clearly one of
[03:51:23] the best teams in the game I don't have
[03:51:24] skill issue and I don't like hot men I
[03:51:26] especially don't like hot sexy men like
[03:51:27] japar who want nothing to do who want to
[03:51:30] do nothing but protect me I don't need
[03:51:32] protection I certainly don't need a hot
[03:51:33] sexy man like japar on my roster what do
[03:51:35] people even see in him a kind
[03:51:37] compassionate and caring individual who
[03:51:38] looks after his family and City how
[03:51:40] could anyone be actually okay with japar
[03:51:42] getting off with getting jard off of
[03:51:45] their departure warp it's simply logical
[03:51:47] that no one should appreciate japar it's
[03:51:49] such a ludicrous idea that anyone would
[03:51:51] want jaar's muscular arms wrapped around
[03:51:52] them while they cudle in bed at night
[03:51:55] after a wonderful night out in bog what
[03:51:57] a silly
[03:52:01] concept who made this who who wrote
[03:52:11] this you I did not write this
[03:52:18] I might tweet it later
[03:52:30] though yeah this a followup attack uh
[03:52:33] pure fiction I remember well I didn't do
[03:52:35] it but I've
[03:52:37] heard
[03:52:43] sorry
[03:52:48] please don't tweet
[03:52:50] anything wait what are you yapping about
[03:52:53] my Twitter never did anything bad what
[03:52:56] is wrong with me tweeting I'm just
[03:52:59] funny
[03:53:01] what that blueberry was
[03:53:11] bad who am I playing oh yeah I need to
[03:53:14] GE
[03:53:15] topaz wait can I just give her the ratio
[03:53:17] like on I pulled
[03:53:19] 20% um wait what team am I
[03:53:31] running wait that's
[03:53:43] huge
[03:53:48] right fall attack ignores defense her
[03:53:50] alt doesn't attack yeah but this isn't
[03:53:51] just to alt right it's when using the
[03:53:53] ultimate oh to attack enemy Target [ __ ]
[03:53:55] I can't read I can't read
[03:54:01] okay why topaz I don't have [ __ ] dude
[03:54:04] I don't have the [ __ ] followup
[03:54:05] attackers from the standard Banner okay
[03:54:07] I don't have any of them I have Yan
[03:54:13] ching
[03:54:15] use
[03:54:17] Clara
[03:54:21] heo so what I was theorizing is like uh
[03:54:24] like in theory right uh add in hominum
[03:54:27] what in theory I would do uh jinglu
[03:54:30] hyper sorry what's his name jingu and
[03:54:32] Hyper carry team and then the other team
[03:54:34] would be uh era and topaz and then I
[03:54:38] just follow with ATT
[03:54:43] them
[03:54:48] that was what I was thinking and then I
[03:54:49] would put Sparkle with J to buff
[03:54:52] lightning
[03:54:53] Lord and I would put Ron May with this
[03:54:58] team and then a Healer or some
[03:55:05] [ __ ] use dot I mean I can but is there
[03:55:09] even a buff for DOT follow attacks
[03:55:12] follow up attack
[03:55:17] this Buffs your alt
[03:55:19] but you
[03:55:28] know who should my I forgot what my team
[03:55:31] was I have't like I maybe Ron was
[03:55:35] here maybe I played P

[04:13:47] helped feels crafting
[04:13:52] but use Kafka Kafka is a followup
[04:13:55] attacker
[04:13:56] technically I don't know if it's better
[04:13:58] than tingyun
[04:14:03] though use the alt one for jinguan yeah

[04:14:07] the play we don't have that many
[04:14:07] followup
[04:14:10] attacks Co

[04:33:31] [Applause]
[04:33:35] pity na math dude the difference between
[04:33:38] 30 and 35 it doesn't
[04:33:40] matter
[04:33:43] 35 minus 30 that's like
[04:33:46] two back in
[04:33:50] business Chad that's you this is our
[04:33:52] height difference that's chat this is
[04:34:03] me but welth good yes well well welth
[04:34:07] but I already have a welth I'm going to
[04:34:08] use him by the way I'm going to use him
[04:34:09] with Aron I already have wels
[04:34:14] multiple multiple
[04:34:28] BOS build wealth dude I I I like zero I
[04:34:32] think one cycled not zero I think it was
[04:34:34] one cycled um with acon wealth no healer
[04:34:38] and my wealth was on it was almost zero
[04:34:40] but it was one cycle and my Acro my my
[04:34:42] wealth wasn't like he literally all I
[04:34:44] did was I went relics I filtered by
[04:34:46] speed I just clicked actually I'm pretty
[04:34:48] sure I did recommended gear and then I
[04:34:50] just
[04:34:51] went
[04:34:53] but you'll see that in the
[04:34:55] video things may change on release and
[04:34:58] also uh W usually wants some damage like
[04:35:01] he does okay damage his damage isn't bad
[04:35:04] but I don't feel like building him
[04:35:05] properly I'm probably just going to
[04:35:06] stack speed on him uh I
[04:35:09] also don't really have spare nil like
[04:35:11] I'm going to be honest I have this for
[04:35:13] Black Swan this for either P or silver
[04:35:15] wolf this for either P or silver wolf
[04:35:17] and then this for Kafka so I'm kind of
[04:35:20] cooked I am not giving his ass for
[04:35:23] Ma so I might
[04:35:30] actually wait
[04:35:40] oops
[04:35:48] [Applause]
[04:35:55] post a video already yeah I know uh mine
[04:35:57] should be out soon like tomorrow morning
[04:35:58] or tonight well technically tonight for
[04:35:59] me cuz I'm not going to sleep it should
[04:36:00] be tomorrow morning for normal
[04:36:08] people when Prime
[04:36:12] minus 600 surely it's worth right I
[04:36:14] don't have good nil lyones like I have
[04:36:16] some but I use so many I use P I use
[04:36:18] silver wolf I use CFA I use Black Swan I
[04:36:20] use uh acon and I use welt kind of I
[04:36:24] want to use wel that's
[04:36:31] six Super impros BR lyone dude JS look
[04:36:34] at what I leveled off stream today look
[04:36:36] you ready jump scare warning okay and
[04:36:39] then guess what guess what guess what I
[04:36:42] [ __ ] got another I have
[04:36:49] two I'm going to go try the scarner
[04:36:51] updates yeah have fun playing League
[04:36:55] Bozo get more I mean it is pretty good I
[04:36:58] like using other lyones though like I
[04:37:00] like having a lot of different ones
[04:37:01] levels I'm going to level
[04:37:02] DDD despite not wanting to I know it's
[04:37:06] good [ __ ]
[04:37:07] you I'll I'll I'll level it
[04:37:10] eventually but I'm trying to save mats
[04:37:12] right now for um Sparkles like not
[04:37:14] Sparkle Arron's icon because I'm
[04:37:16] definitely getting
[04:37:37] that okay well this was fun um I got to
[04:37:40] go do some stuff
[04:37:42] so I guess there's already videos about
[04:37:43] Aron so uh with that in mind I will have
[04:37:46] mine out within a few hours please go
[04:37:48] watch it let me know what you think it's
[04:37:50] it's like lowkey a guide but I'm not
[04:37:52] calling it a guide because I probably
[04:37:54] will re some more full one later uh but
[04:37:55] it's a review uh go watch it uh x mark
[04:37:58] YouTube if you want to catch it as it's
[04:38:00] out there will be a genin stream again
[04:38:02] in probably two days and then star rail
[04:38:04] when she's when Acron is
[04:38:06] out um if you're new
[04:38:10] hi
[04:38:12] so I'm a bit deded today but I hope
[04:38:15] you're all doing well seven days is
[04:38:18] it yeah it
[04:38:29] is okay now that everyone's gone and
[04:38:31] only the cool people are
[04:38:36] here Sparkle clears acaron but don't
[04:38:40] tell anyone I said that
[04:38:46] anyways but Aron's sick like she's she's
[04:38:49] really cool anyways
[04:38:53] uh Soldier there's a gifted I appreciate
[04:38:55] it P bigel there's a sub Elena doesn't
[04:39:05] follow B plus tunil plus Sparkle instead
[04:39:08] of sustain just you if you're using
[04:39:10] wealth yeah if you're not you're you're
[04:39:12] dead well if you can like zero cycle
[04:39:15] before you die sure if not you're [ __ ]
[04:39:19] but if you have wealth you can do that
[04:39:21] that's what I
[04:39:22] uh
[04:39:24] allegedly would do well not necessarily
[04:39:27] what I would do but I like that
[04:39:29] team you can also get E2 yeah but with
[04:39:32] E2 you would still want a Healer you
[04:39:34] just replace an aity you do like Pila
[04:39:36] and then like Ron May or some [ __ ]
[04:39:38] Sparkle BR
[04:39:40] whatever
[04:39:43] what's also cool though is because she
[04:39:44] doesn't need energy and because she gets
[04:39:46] her Alt from uh allies just like like
[04:39:50] like debuffs debuff
[04:39:52] stacking um you can have your supports
[04:39:55] go really fast like really fast and then
[04:39:58] boom you get your
[04:40:01] alt regardless of hert speed although
[04:40:03] hert speed is still important but even
[04:40:05] regardless of
[04:40:08] it so attack boots Suk I I think feels
[04:40:12] crafting well this isn't really feels
[04:40:14] crafting cuz there has been math done on
[04:40:15] it but I'm going to say feels crafting
[04:40:16] because she's not out uh speed Booth
[04:40:18] should be better for your entire
[04:40:19] rotation but attack you don't get
[04:40:21] punished as hard for going attack boots
[04:40:23] because you can still get your alt back
[04:40:26] um fast through your
[04:40:29] supports because speed lets you use your
[04:40:32] skill Aron needs a lot of attack okay
[04:40:34] attack
[04:40:36] orb
[04:40:38] um but
[04:40:40] yeah
[04:40:43] it's
[04:40:44] um acaron needs me
[04:40:49] okay but yeah it depends tack are better
[04:40:52] it depends for what for your alt yes but
[04:40:55] skill speed lets you go more often which
[04:40:57] lets you skill more often which can be
[04:40:59] more rotation damage and sometimes even
[04:41:00] if it isn't it lets you do more
[04:41:02] toughness damage right because you break
[04:41:03] the F you break enemies more often if
[04:41:05] you're going more often which I value
[04:41:06] pretty highly with a character like her
