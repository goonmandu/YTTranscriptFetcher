[00:25:59] let me close another Google
[00:26:01] Chrome hi z h do you think you could
[00:26:05] review my yo I have worked very hard on
[00:26:08] her shouid
[00:26:11] 634 mil4
[00:26:15] 39366 um I don't typically review
[00:26:17] characters for bits but uh money talks
[00:26:21] yeah let's do it six all right cely seal
[00:26:26] IRL five 63
[00:26:29] achievements let's click on it yiko
[00:26:32] 2,000 attack
[00:26:35] Z how do you have exactly zero
[00:26:43] em that's okay maybe you don't [ __ ]
[00:26:45] maybe you don't play Y in a denter team
[00:26:48] at all maybe this is a non-er team in
[00:26:49] which case sure wiith
[00:26:53] okay to be fair you can gain em from
[00:26:55] wiith but
[00:26:59] two glad 2 TF okay they're living in uh
[00:27:03] 2022 constellation c0 talents 7 10
[00:27:08] n this was the Y build when she first
[00:27:10] came out since then we got like two
[00:27:12] better sets but it's okay
[00:27:15] glad that's pretty
[00:27:18] good that is missing crit damage but 15
[00:27:21] attack with ER is okay that's really
[00:27:24] good also very good
[00:27:33] how the [ __ ] this like miles better than
[00:27:36] all your other pieces except maybe the
[00:27:37] Goblet but yeah this is insane feather's
[00:27:41] insane um sounds yeah the rest is pretty
[00:27:44] good I I would say if you're
[00:27:48] playing yeah this is really good if
[00:27:50] you're you might need a bit more ER
[00:27:52] depending on your team and you might
[00:27:53] need um a bit of em if you're like
[00:27:56] aggravating cuz em s becomes better than
[00:27:58] attack sends however R5 wiiz gives you
[00:28:00] 480 Em which is a lot I mean it also
[00:28:04] could give you attack yeah it still
[00:28:06] applies but anyways worse than FAL
[00:28:11] LMFAO okay
[00:28:15] anyways
[00:28:19] um why does someone say I'm the first
[00:28:21] person to do a scuffed stream in 2024
[00:28:23] it's not even scuffed it's just a
[00:28:25] different background and I'm sick so I
[00:28:26] sound IL I will be home soon okay it is
[00:28:31] temporary anyways not a bad guy
[00:28:33] obviously if you want a better set you
[00:28:34] can go either golden troop or guilded
[00:28:36] dreams but 2v is fine
[00:28:39] too let me review a random person [ __ ]
[00:28:42] it um Atlas is ar60 so hey there I
[00:28:47] expect quality Ula for ar60 Ula pfp
[00:28:50] almost 2500 attack song of broken penis
[00:28:54] four pale flame
[00:28:56] see
[00:28:58] C6 okay triple crowd C6 Ula R1 broken
[00:29:03] Pines let's see let's see the build
[00:29:04] let's see the
[00:29:06] build that is not bad oh that's crit
[00:29:08] rate okay I take back me saying it's not
[00:29:11] bad that is amazing let's look at the
[00:29:13] second piece okay also really
[00:29:16] good you also have H A one to one attack
[00:29:19] to HP which doesn't mean much but it's
[00:29:21] satisfying sense pretty good
[00:29:25] goblet pretty tasty
[00:29:28] Aqua thanks of 5 months bro things of
[00:29:33] 14
[00:29:35] ciret kind of fell off not bad attack
[00:29:38] and crit rate still pretty good but for
[00:29:40] a C6 Ula after seeing your first two
[00:29:42] pieces this could be a little bit better
[00:29:44] but it's still not bad circlets aren't
[00:29:45] easy um circlets can be hard can you
[00:29:48] what
[00:29:50] 5 yo yo this is the most Ula man Ula I
[00:29:54] have ever seen this is a C6 Ula who's
[00:29:57] press retry in the abyss with no
[00:29:59] energy I like it I actually love this
[00:30:02] you for convenience will you review my
[00:30:05] account 619
[00:30:08] m74
[00:30:11] 310
[00:30:13] I'm I'm
[00:30:15] not not doing uid reviews right now
[00:30:22] I can you review my K are just finished
[00:30:26] okay no more I'll do like Ka so rip Bozo
[00:30:28] to the other person just because it's Ka
[00:30:30] however no we're not doing we can't
[00:30:32] spend all stream doing J reviews okay
[00:30:34] this is one also your name is Kaa so
[00:30:37] well close enough Kaa 87 out of 90 11
[00:30:40] months Miss spitter reforged okay I like
[00:30:43] it you have the skin two piece two piece
[00:30:45] that's fine C1 I mean it's Kaa it's hard
[00:30:47] to get 888 that's not a true kaay main
[00:30:50] not even
[00:30:52] crowned but it's okay let's look at the
[00:30:55] artifacts very good
[00:30:59] is this a [ __ ] joke is this a joke
[00:31:02] your parents named you Kaa and this is
[00:31:04] how you treat them sorry 2024 the year
[00:31:07] of the pirate mate wait this is insane
[00:31:09] you should be playing Pirate before ye
[00:31:11] ends up walking the plank and going down
[00:31:13] to than for $5
[00:31:16] arges this is a really cracked s this is
[00:31:18] insane goblet oh my oh my okay dude this
[00:31:22] feather is the only bad piece everything
[00:31:23] else is amazing
[00:31:25] honestly um you could probably just
[00:31:28] strong box blizzard to get one other
[00:31:29] piece if you want a two piece twopiece
[00:31:30] you can also use other two pieces um but
[00:31:33] overall this is probably a really good
[00:31:34] ratio if we
[00:31:35] check that's pretty good could use a bit
[00:31:37] more crit rate but it's
[00:31:40] fine
[00:31:43] yeah yeah
[00:31:45] nice Vermilion goblet aware yeah wait a
[00:31:48] second you have a Vermillion goblet but
[00:31:50] you have no Shia so how did you get
[00:31:53] Vermilion that's interesting how did you
[00:31:55] get Vermilion on your account that's
[00:31:57] that's
[00:32:03] interesting wait what the [ __ ] am I
[00:32:05] looking
[00:32:10] at Abyss oh yeah the abyss boxes wait
[00:32:15] how much resin do I have oh I swear I
[00:32:19] promise you I uncapped it twice today
[00:32:20] that's why I'm next to a lay line bro I
[00:32:22] literally woke up I slept with 80 resin
[00:32:24] cuz I'm like I'll wake up I'll stream
[00:32:25] early I was sick I didn't early I
[00:32:27] uncapped my resin to 140 I was going to
[00:32:29] start stream it was 160 I uncapped it to
[00:32:32] 140 went around started stream and now
[00:32:35] it's 160 again my cat ate my rabbit so
[00:32:37] review my and your cat didn't eat your
[00:32:42] rabbit6
[00:32:45] 7,795 because my cat ate my
[00:32:51] rabbit did she just dodge my Navia
[00:32:56] e
[00:33:00] I manag 31 Stars wait
[00:33:04] wait new
[00:33:06] Abyss IM only get 31 Stars
[00:33:11] damn congrats if that's your new Heist
[00:33:15] chat I was thinking okay don't tell
[00:33:16] anyone about this idea okay because it
[00:33:18] takes me like a year to go from idea to
[00:33:21] content and and so don't tell anyone
[00:33:23] okay I was thinking but I don't know if
[00:33:27] this will be good content or
[00:33:31] not this is something that I have never
[00:33:33] seen except in other
[00:33:36] games okay you know how like every game
[00:33:39] has like a rank though right where you
[00:33:41] guess people's rank okay and I was
[00:33:43] joking like yo what if we did a guess
[00:33:44] the crit damage we're not going to do
[00:33:45] that but you know how like everyone has
[00:33:46] like oh guessing your ranks oh reviewing
[00:33:49] your whatever the [ __ ] okay what if for
[00:33:51] people that are struggling with Abyss
[00:33:53] right either like the most like scuffed
[00:33:54] clears or like 30 Stars 36 Maybe even 36
[00:33:58] uh 34 or like really good clears what if
[00:34:00] we did reviewing viewers clears and then
[00:34:02] I make you guys record your Abyss runs
[00:34:04] and then you send them to me and re
[00:34:06] review them and especially if it's not
[00:34:07] 36 like looking for help or if you know
[00:34:10] it's scuffed and you just want to get
[00:34:11] made fun of
[00:34:14] lovingly wouldn't that be content that
[00:34:17] dude and never done before it'll
[00:34:19] probably get copied by everyone once we
[00:34:20] do it to be
[00:34:22] fair wouldn't that be
[00:34:24] content it could be terrible it might be
[00:34:27] disc it might be like dog [ __ ] it might
[00:34:29] be really good I don't know but I think
[00:34:30] that's a good idea in which case we will
[00:34:32] probably put a submission form in
[00:34:34] Discord exclamation mark Discord I'll
[00:34:35] put that in announcements you can like
[00:34:37] post your like YouTube it'll be probably
[00:34:38] unlisted YouTube uh ideally not a file
[00:34:40] because I don't want to get a virus uh
[00:34:42] and will'll watch it on stream I think
[00:34:44] that' be a great idea we'll talk about
[00:34:45] it more later I'll probably post an
[00:34:46] announcement this is the first good idea
[00:34:48] of your life sorry uh I don't know if I
[00:34:51] want to give constructive criticism or
[00:34:53] if we just want to laugh at people uh
[00:34:55] like you know in a Content way not not
[00:34:56] in a mean way but we'll see uh I guess
[00:34:59] it'll depend maybe a bit of both
[00:35:02] um cuz like I feel like people I don't
[00:35:05] know I think we'll do both I think we'll
[00:35:07] do both what if we give what if we're
[00:35:08] like a harsh
[00:35:10] teacher why is Zio not in the
[00:35:13] basement nice and the Jeff said I could
[00:35:15] go outside for a bit I'm going to be
[00:35:17] back in the basement in probably two or
[00:35:18] 3 days which should be next stream wait
[00:35:21] I already took the butterflies the
[00:35:25] hell dude I feel bad I told Z Jeff we'd
[00:35:28] play RuneScape together and then his
[00:35:30] sleep schedule he literally wakes up at
[00:35:32] like f like 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. and
[00:35:35] at that time I'm in bed and then now I
[00:35:37] got sick so I I've just been like sad
[00:35:40] but it's
[00:35:43] okay dude he literally sleeps at like
[00:35:45] 6:00
[00:35:49] p.m.
[00:35:52] anyways why do I have to pee already I
[00:35:54] just [ __ ] started anyways I managed
[00:35:58] to avoid uh any spoilers of the Abyss I
[00:36:01] genuinely have no clue what's in it
[00:36:02] except I heard that the hydro [ __ ] is
[00:36:06] in
[00:36:06] it but I heard about that like a month

[00:36:13] at burst that's the only thing I know I
[00:36:15] haven't actually looked at the enemies
[00:36:16] yet like genuinely so I don't know if
[00:36:18] you need elements hopefully for the
[00:36:20] first time in a while Shia's going to be
[00:36:21] good again because Shia great for AOE
[00:36:23] genuinely not bad character pretty
[00:36:25] strong DPS but the past like six no like

[00:40:51] request line except maybe Yia anyways
[00:40:55] welcome to okay okay
[00:40:58] chat uh I was right I
[00:41:00] forget also okay by the way the tenot
[00:41:04] okay so I had editor apps open and I
[00:41:06] found a few cool people so we're going
[00:41:07] to be tring some people I think um but I
[00:41:11] actually made a random decision where I
[00:41:13] said so our second Channel editor marai
[00:41:16] gigachad carrying the channel on his
[00:41:17] back uh I said bro like low key his
[00:41:21] editing so good what if I just gave him
[00:41:23] the tenha account review so the whale
[00:41:25] account review he will be working on and
[00:41:27] that will be on the main channel so
[00:41:29] there's it's finally in the process of
[00:41:30] being uploaded well
[00:41:33] edited so we'll see and I'll try to have
[00:41:35] another editor for like the other stuff
[00:41:36] that's backlogged cuz I'm really
[00:41:38] backlogged right now so I'm trying to
[00:41:39] figure it out for next year or this year
[00:41:41] um so I think that's going to happen I
[00:41:43] still need another editor for well
[00:41:45] probably through the people that I'm
[00:41:46] traving for like other videos um because
[00:41:49] I feel like I do I record a lot but I
[00:41:51] end up uploading like half of it so
[00:41:53] we'll see um dude why do people keep
[00:41:56] asked me if I'm going to stream
[00:41:57] Minecraft why the [ __ ] would I stream

[00:51:32] this okay this should be
[00:51:37] fine yo my PC is only at 82 degrees
[00:51:40] yesterday when I was streaming is like
[00:51:41] over 90 so I don't know what I did but
[00:51:43] pogging okay let's play a real team
[00:51:45] first half and then second half we'll
[00:51:46] play uh Mr cockmaster
[00:51:50] Chow do I need any
[00:51:52] elements not really I'm just Chow
[00:51:56] kazua
[00:51:58] farizon and
[00:52:01] Bennett actually
[00:52:04] de sorry she's getting buffed this year
[00:52:07] so we might as well use her before it's
[00:52:08] cool like I'm a DEA player before it was
[00:52:10] cool to be a de
[00:52:12] player I was a d player before it was
[00:52:14] cool to be a de
[00:52:17] player no
[00:52:21] cop
[00:52:23] dead evil conquering
[00:52:28] can I [ __ ] hit that
[00:52:30] okay dude I saw a post on the beautiful
[00:52:34] website that is
[00:52:35] x.com uh and they were like they were
[00:52:38] like oh who do you think the best DPS in
[00:52:40] 4.0 is and like or 4 pointx whatever and
[00:52:43] like there's like a picture for best DPS
[00:52:45] of each like one point whatever two
[00:52:47] point whatever and three point whatever
[00:52:48] and they were all wrong because the
[00:52:49] answer of all three is I SP every was
[00:52:52] unironically Shang Ling and they put
[00:52:54] like who aaka and
[00:52:58] like like Bloom although to be fair if
[00:53:02] you're factoring in what the content was
[00:53:04] back then that it's venty and then kind
[00:53:06] of AA cuz freezing was really good um
[00:53:09] cuz everything could be
[00:53:11] frozen but like
[00:53:20] yeah dude I honestly think that a lot of
[00:53:23] the the people that are like okay I
[00:53:25] think there's a lot of hindsight Harries
[00:53:27] with regards to Hut cuz Hut's obviously
[00:53:30] always been pretty good but like she got
[00:53:32] a lot better because they actually
[00:53:33] started putting bosses in the abyss cuz
[00:53:35] back when it was like back when there
[00:53:37] was like like one point whatever it was
[00:53:38] like venti would just group everything
[00:53:40] and carry you and then even after that
[00:53:42] kind of stopped working Abyss was still
[00:53:44] so AOE that you'd rather have like AOE
[00:53:46] teams or someone that could hit
[00:53:48] everything like [ __ ] pyron or sha
[00:53:50] even or child
[00:53:53] whatever but yeah
[00:53:57] now they carry
[00:53:59] true hopefully sh cuz the last slot on a
[00:54:02] sh team bar fora finina kind of is good
[00:54:04] with Shia but outside of finina the best
[00:54:06] last slot like the last slot in a Shia
[00:54:08] team if you have C6 fars on is literally
[00:54:09] anything they all [ __ ] like they're
[00:54:11] all mid cuz Dr Le can't go midth cuz
[00:54:13] your far on midth and like toas C6 is
[00:54:16] pretty
[00:54:17] good um and like OA full crit is
[00:54:21] good
[00:54:23] so got another shot
[00:54:26] support but we have finina
[00:54:42] so this Yan CAO help too
[00:54:47] yeah ready evil
[00:54:53] conquering I mean sh got helped a lot
[00:54:55] too though like I think Shia's
[00:54:57] performance when he was like new and
[00:54:59] like for probably a year was like really
[00:55:02] honestly like very above average because
[00:55:04] the enemies were like a bunch of enemies
[00:55:05] that would group up and you would plunge
[00:55:06] all of them which is when child was
[00:55:08] really good but then it's
[00:55:10] like they started adding bosses and a
[00:55:12] bunch of cringe [ __ ] to the abyss like
[00:55:14] stuff that needs Elements which is when
[00:55:16] it was like he got buffed through like
[00:55:18] farizon and [ __ ] and now finina and
[00:55:22] hopefully another character
[00:55:26] sorry and he got an artifact set and
[00:55:28] then another artifact set that power
[00:55:29] crap the other one and then and then
[00:55:31] another artifact set and then another
[00:55:32] artifact set and then the artifact set
[00:55:33] that we've been grinding went into the
[00:55:35] strong box and then he got an event
[00:55:36] weapon and then he got new five star
[00:55:37] weapons and then he got support
[00:55:38] characters he can work with and
[00:55:41] then what cons I never L uh zero most of
[00:55:45] my five stars are see
[00:55:48] Zero not Chia though but Chia doesn't
[00:55:51] really wait okay this is new floor 11
[00:55:54] okay new floor 11 uh slimes and hydro
[00:55:58] mimics which I [ __ ] hate bubble

[00:56:03] [ __ ] with it yeah we'll just go Animo

[01:03:19] you're probably talking about Scara yes
[01:03:21] he's good enough okay I don't need to
[01:03:22] play him for you to say to to determined
[01:03:25] that but he is
[01:03:27] geared okay here's what we're going to

[01:03:30] fl2 two clears with whatever teams we
[01:03:33] want the first one we're going to gamble

[01:03:37] going to do four star clears two of them
[01:03:39] that might be a separate upload on the
[01:03:40] second Channel I might upload the four
[01:03:41] star clear uh but anyways we're going to
[01:03:43] do two at least four teams probably
[01:03:48] and um I haven't seen what the new Abyss
[01:03:51] is so new Abyss new year new Z
[01:03:55] this is a temporary setup I'm sick
[01:03:56] excuse the nasal what penis but okay I
[01:04:01] only saw what 121 is and I know there's
[01:04:03] a hydroa somewhere so far both single
[01:04:06] Target which Mia as a Shain uh currently
[01:04:09] wants to lament off a bridge chamber two
[01:04:12] this actually good for us that's all
[01:04:14] what the [ __ ]
[01:04:16] Gio
[01:04:19] Gio okay uh this is
[01:04:23] fine [ __ ] Tula first
[01:04:26] H okay dude Shia's really good here
[01:04:29] against run guards and [ __ ] but also and
[01:04:32] he's fine against PMA but it's goingon
[01:04:34] to be annoying against the tulpa God
[01:04:36] damn it
[01:04:38] whatever also tulpa I'm pretty sure can
[01:04:40] vaporize you if you play Bennett cuz
[01:04:41] he's hydro and if you just Bennett burst
[01:04:43] you just get one shot so that's going to
[01:04:45] be
[01:04:52] fun okay and this if this is too easy we
[01:04:55] might not upload it but yeah we'll see
[01:04:57] hydroa thunder water tur this one has
[01:04:59] run grader run guard Geo [ __ ] which
[01:05:02] means you probably want like a claymore
[01:05:03] or you just ignore it I guess play
[01:05:07] National
[01:05:09] okay why is everyone saying yoia why the
[01:05:11] [ __ ] would I want to play
[01:05:13] yoia Sorry that was [ __ ]
[01:05:16] up whoa I can Vape the tulpa
[01:05:21] whoa yeah I mean she's probably good
[01:05:23] here
[01:05:25] but so is any pyro
[01:05:32] character unless mean second half but
[01:05:34] that would be worse cuz it seems like
[01:05:36] there's a lot of enemies it only be good
[01:05:38] for men if we could play tanari I mean I
[01:05:41] could play Yia
[01:05:45] but you never show Yia love
[01:05:48] true not her fault though she's fine she
[01:05:51] okay I want to play Navia she's new a
[01:05:53] weird usually play the new character are
[01:05:54] we play Navia second maybe although some
[01:05:57] of these enemies have Geo
[01:05:59] resistance
[01:06:01] but oh yeah there's [ __ ] Geo slimes
[01:06:04] yeah maybe
[01:06:06] not maybe first yeah I'll play her
[01:06:17] first okay we play different team second
[01:06:21] oh we could
[01:06:23] Linny
[01:06:25] well I could play ly against this
[01:06:36] guy
[01:06:39] orow cuz like Lenny like you'll just
[01:06:41] monop pyro this guy monop pyro these
[01:06:43] three and then kiri's Hydro so you're
[01:06:45] vaping yeah you lose the monop Pyro but
[01:06:46] who cares you're running [ __ ] Bennett
[01:06:48] who's going to vape lind's going to vape
[01:06:50] and Shang Ling's going to vape [ __ ] it
[01:06:52] and then Kazo can also just infuses
[01:06:55] burst or we probably play J Lee cuz I
[01:06:57] don't want to die
[01:07:00] yeah okay we'll start with Navia Shia
[01:07:02] though I think Shia against Thunderman
[01:07:04] if
[01:07:05] annoying but he's probably good here

[01:22:21] was
[01:22:23] bro is Navia made out of
[01:22:26] paper is Navia made out of [ __ ] paper

[01:23:00] happen let me play like I'm Not Afraid
[01:23:02] at all and if I win then I'll consider
[01:23:04] scamming the
[01:23:08] doubters we're just going to DPS we're
[01:23:09] just going to
[01:23:14] DPS could have done more attacks there
[01:23:16] that my

[01:23:24] Reve I have to die once to be relatable
[01:23:26] to like new
[01:23:29] players to be no rest for the wicked
[01:23:32] this one's got your name on it
[01:23:39] attack guess maybe this is a lesson when
[01:23:42] you're afraid that's when bad things
[01:23:44] happen but if you're not afraid and
[01:23:45] you're just you're just doing what you
[01:23:46] always do that's the best way to succeed
[01:23:49] even when the pressure's on team is
[01:23:52] feeling
[01:23:54] lucky burst burst
[01:23:57] burst at you as you wish wi my
[01:24:02] greatt
[01:24:06] first okay that was so much easier that
[01:24:09] was so easy that was so easy I just he
[01:24:14] hits hard okay he hits hard I wasn't
[01:24:19] prepared
[01:24:20] please Mari edit out the part of me
[01:24:23] dying oh first try so far so good let's
[01:24:26] see if 123 second half on our first try
[01:24:29] as well will go good or not okay uh
[01:24:31] let's go we have our
[01:24:33] bursts because of the energy from
[01:24:35] killing the enemies I forgot about
[01:24:38] that they're about to hit me so
[01:24:41] Dodge what the [ __ ] okay well they split
[01:24:44] up I [ __ ] up the grouping it's okay
[01:24:51] Dodge
[01:25:00] com your coming was for told oh this
[01:25:03] looks easy we got this I'm even going to
[01:25:05] I'm going to suck them never mind they
[01:25:08] summon the thing can't stagger anymore
[01:25:10] bro bro
[01:25:13] lament T's pretty good here cuz you hit
[01:25:15] all of
[01:25:16] them wow that was so easy as long as you
[01:25:18] don't get killed by the too okay listen
[01:25:20] let this be a lesson
[01:25:22] in life you do better in stressful
[01:25:25] situations when you just act normal like
[01:25:27] like you're calm and at ease let's say
[01:25:29] the biggest exam of your life is coming
[01:25:30] up and you're like stressed you're
[01:25:31] worried you look at it you look at the
[01:25:33] results oh my God I made the dumbest
[01:25:35] mistakes how could I make these mistakes
[01:25:37] I've never made this mistake before in
[01:25:39] my life I've never confused this before
[01:25:41] in my life but you made that mistake why
[01:25:43] how it's because you were stressed and
[01:25:45] you were Your Own Worst Enemy okay that
[01:25:48] is the lesson that you can uh derive
[01:25:50] from this abis because when I just ask
[01:25:52] acted natural I cleared the pulpa easily
[01:25:54] you would you watch that like what the
[01:25:55] [ __ ] Z is so good but the first time we
[01:25:57] did it we got one shot because I was
[01:25:59] nervous there was vomit on my sweater
[01:26:01] already mom spaghetti okay anyways first
[01:26:04] try we cleared it easy we're going to
[01:26:05] try some other teams

[01:34:06] get a clean sweep can we get a clean

[01:53:56] issue I all swapped but it didn't work I
[01:53:58] [ __ ] hate alt swapping dude most
[01:54:00] people don't even know you can hold alt
[01:54:01] press the number and it uses your alt as
[01:54:03] you swap cuz it never [ __ ]
[01:54:07] works the it's fine calm down I'm going

[01:54:48] flames
[01:54:51] not bad floor 13 out yet
[01:54:54] no okay Flo 13
[01:55:07] time this Abyss is so good H I actually
[01:55:11] don't know how do I feel about the I
[01:55:12] haven't thought about it screaming down
[01:55:13] the hall is driving me insane WTF is an
[01:55:17] outs
[01:55:18] swap I like
[01:55:21] what is the alt swap okay look look if I
[01:55:26] if I okay let's say I swap to to to net
[01:55:29] right I press
[01:55:31] three I press three right net but if I
[01:55:35] hold alt and I press three look what
[01:55:36] happens but for some re like usually it
[01:55:38] presses your alt and you swap but for
[01:55:40] some reason
[01:55:41] 96.7% of the time when you're in abyss
[01:55:43] and you do that it just it'll swap and
[01:55:45] he'll just do that and then he won't Al
[01:55:46] then he dies and then you guys in chat
[01:55:48] you [ __ ] Fons in the chat like you
[01:55:54] suck anyways let's go to the
[01:56:01] ab um personally I like the Perpetual
[01:56:04] mechanical array uh Thunder
[01:56:06] manifestation can go [ __ ] itself uh this
[01:56:09] half is fine this half is also fine
[01:56:11] although G sles are annoying for some
[01:56:12] teams but it's fine like this is fine
[01:56:15] and then hydroa I think is cool cuz he
[01:56:16] can actually oneshot you and I think
[01:56:18] enemies that can oneshot you as long as
[01:56:20] they're fair and dodgeable is actually
[01:56:21] pretty cool second half also fine I
[01:56:23] think I just don't like the thunder man
[01:56:24] if the rest is
[01:56:31] fine it's almost my birthday will you

[02:00:27] hypothetically we did the abyss with
[02:00:29] fourstar
[02:00:31] teams and we used
[02:00:33] cave as like a a new character to use
[02:00:37] he's new not really but sure uh we would
[02:00:39] probably do
[02:00:41] SRO I'd say kie for hyper blo and it's
[02:00:44] probably still the answer however I
[02:00:46] don't even know if we need an electro
[02:00:47] cuz thunder man if and the I mean yeah
[02:00:50] it's probably still worth first half
[02:00:53] we're no matter like I think the best
[02:00:54] team to use first half here unless we're
[02:00:56] playing National is for sure this like
[02:00:58] for sure this team we dude this team we
[02:01:02] pioneered [ __ ] two years ago now
[02:01:04] everyone's using it not true but it's
[02:01:05] really
[02:01:06] good we used to play this well actually
[02:01:09] Z Jeff used to play this initially
[02:01:11] before Rosaria came out with diona a
[02:01:13] little bit more
[02:01:15] copium but then we got Rosaria and I was
[02:01:18] like wait love this team and I put her
[02:01:26] in
[02:01:28] water okay who should the last character
[02:01:30] be so typically if I'm playing Hy ow
[02:01:33] typically if I'm playing hyper blo um I
[02:01:36] would put like maybe like a sucrose or
[02:01:38] uh what I could do is like let's say you
[02:01:40] playing hyper I would do like fishal uh
[02:01:42] sucrose SRO and then a dendro and then
[02:01:45] i' I'd swirl uh the the the hyper blo me
[02:01:48] with with my sucos but what I think
[02:01:50] we're going to do is we're going to play
[02:01:51] cave we're going to play SRO and we're
[02:01:55] going to play cookie
[02:01:57] Emoji last slot I'm not sure we could do
[02:02:01] ya Yao but my cave is already on
[02:02:03] deepwood and that's very low damage
[02:02:05] outside of hyper Bloom I kind of want
[02:02:06] another damage dealer uh like if I could
[02:02:09] play a five star put like gilon there
[02:02:10] but not sure activate the cave cons oh
[02:02:14] we
[02:02:17] could fish I ficial is not a bad idea no
[02:02:21] but Thunderman
[02:02:24] if Toma would be okay but
[02:02:30] uh Cav is better with only bloom yeah
[02:02:32] but only bloom is so bad well like
[02:02:34] without nuu it's just like the team
[02:02:36] damage is a lot lower cuz like what what
[02:02:38] else are we putting in the team no
[02:02:40] fourstar dendro character outside of
[02:02:42] like technically C would actually deal
[02:02:44] damage and no fourar Hydro out of SRO
[02:02:46] would deal damage I mean the only one's
[02:02:48] Barbara right
[02:02:50] Candace so it would suck like our team's
[02:02:52] damage would be
[02:02:56] worse Kirara Kirara is not a bad idea
[02:02:58] but also mostly just Shields no but
[02:03:01] Kirara Buffs you right Kirara has Buffs
[02:03:03] in her kit okay we get we can play
[02:03:06] Kirara
[02:03:07] um Kirara
[02:03:11] has is it just our constellations it
[02:03:13] might just be our
[02:03:17] constellations
[02:03:20] yeah it's just the con I know her C6
[02:03:22] gives you damage and I know C2 gives you
[02:03:23] dendra
[02:03:26] app okay I mean that's fine do I have
[02:03:30] cave
[02:03:33] cons where's
[02:03:35] cave I cannot find
[02:03:40] him I have two should I activate
[02:03:43] two this does
[02:03:47] nothing normal attacks speed
[02:03:50] wow mean
[02:04:04] sure should I go instructor Kirara what
[02:04:07] if we keep our Kirara on deepwood and we
[02:04:10] go Super Hyper carry cave and we say
[02:04:12] [ __ ] deepwood we go like
[02:04:17] gilded or golden lowkey
[02:04:23] but clam clam cave actually kind of
[02:04:27] works it's funny okay we'll go go Guild
[02:04:31] of
[02:04:33] Dreams we'll go Guild the dreams should
[02:04:36] I just take alam's pieces that would be
[02:04:37] kind of Canon feel like that's something
[02:04:39] Cav would
[02:04:40] do okay let's just take alyam
[02:04:47] pieces watch this new background what
[02:04:51] happened to the stairs and the base the
[02:04:53] stairs will be back next
[02:04:55] stream it is
[02:04:57] temporary don't worry my child don't you
[02:05:00] worry don't you worry
[02:05:02] child I'll be there for you sorry uh
[02:05:07] we're going to take this sound let's
[02:05:10] look at our ratio 67.2 151 164 ER 437 em
[02:05:15] decent well pretty low attack but we get
[02:05:17] more uh if we are proing rea such as
[02:05:19] Bloom uh or even hyper Bloom being level
[02:05:21] 90 is very important unfortunately I
[02:05:24] don't know what the [ __ ] a morning
[02:05:25] flower
[02:05:26] is I'm not even being ironic I can't
[02:05:29] remember the last time I've seen this um
[02:05:32] so he's level
[02:05:34] 80 will we Nine Star I'm actually not
[02:05:37] sure but we can
[02:05:42] try it's a desert yeah I figured okay
[02:05:44] this might actually not work I'm kind of
[02:05:47] afraid um we'll do one try with this and
[02:05:49] if it doesn't work we'll
[02:05:59] swap also I don't know if um Kirara is
[02:06:03] better than Yao yaa here cuz Yaya would
[02:06:06] give us someone to be on field
[02:06:08] with and you can be on field with Kirara
[02:06:11] but you can't normal attack in her cat
[02:06:13] form but whatever we'll just try
[02:06:17] it
[02:06:21] are you ready I'm ready dude am I dude
[02:06:23] am I okay like what am I saying right
[02:06:25] now I don't know thanks for all the subs

[02:06:37] Aquilla you unfield cave are you dumb
[02:06:40] are are you
[02:06:42] dumb yes you onfield cave but like you
[02:06:45] spent a bit of time on your other
[02:06:46] characters too and ya let us do
[02:06:51] that but Kirara can too I guess cuz like
[02:06:54] I want to be able to normal attack I
[02:06:56] mean what's the exact time of the
[02:07:00] infusion uh where the [ __ ] is it it's on
[02:07:02] the skill
[02:07:05] right never mind I'm
[02:07:08] stupid it's been a while maybe I am
[02:07:13] dumb does it say it somewhere duration
[02:07:16] 12 seconds oh it's just burst never mind
[02:07:18] it's just
[02:07:23] burst
[02:07:25] yeah yeah that's [ __ ] 20us 12 chat
[02:07:28] that's a lot of time that's 8 seconds
[02:07:30] you be normal attack or like I mean it's
[02:07:32] not really 8 seconds cuz you're like
[02:07:34] swapping and [ __ ] but
[02:07:37] still
[02:07:39] anyways we're going to
[02:07:42] do yeah I just needed to put Bennett on
[02:07:45] uh sapwood that's
[02:07:47] all
[02:07:59] okay for St clear time Ka I almost said
[02:08:02] cave Kaa
[02:08:05] Rosalina benen no sorry Shang Ling first
[02:08:09] where Shang Ling Shang Ling Bennett
[02:08:11] second half we're probably going to swap
[02:08:13] this team eventually but for now let's
[02:08:15] try it we'll see if we can do it with
[02:08:17] our level 80 cavic
[02:08:19] so we're going to do cave sing
[02:08:22] trol
[02:08:24] Kookie and I would do ficial but I can't
[02:08:28] cuz Thunder manifestation so we're going
[02:08:29] to do
[02:08:31] Kirara I don't know if this going to
[02:08:33] work we'll
[02:08:34] see let me blow my
[02:08:45] nose you think I have a sharp tongue I
[02:08:48] just tell it like it is okay let's
[02:08:50] go boom boom I'm actually going to Shang
[02:08:53] Ling first even though I lose out on
[02:08:54] Rosario's crit raid buff because I want
[02:08:56] to make sure my uh Rosaria melts oh my
[02:08:59] God I missed cuz I'm on Dragon's vein
[02:09:00] was what I was going to say but my
[02:09:02] Rosaria missed so now I'm
[02:09:07] upset it's fine though I think it'll be
[02:09:15] okay why are you in the closet I'm not
[02:09:18] in a
[02:09:21] closet shiver me timbers
[02:09:24] boom pick up the
[02:09:27] pepper I mean that pepper is useless we
[02:09:30] already snapshotted
[02:09:32] did you know shling snapshots chat do
[02:09:34] you know that do you know that do you
[02:09:35] know that yes or no yes
[02:09:39] okay so does Kaa so does
[02:09:46] Rosaria uh not the best placement but we
[02:09:48] should still be able to kill it here cuz
[02:09:50] it takes a lot of
[02:09:52] damage
[02:09:54] boom I don't really want to use any more
[02:09:56] burst if I don't have
[02:10:01] to oh I'm going to have
[02:10:04] to okay this should be enough bursts no
[02:10:07] more no don't kill him energy okay we
[02:10:10] got it we got the energy he can die
[02:10:12] now
[02:10:13] go okay this should be fine Cave against
[02:10:16] the thunder man if might be hard though
[02:10:17] this is probably going be the hardest
[02:10:18] chamber for cave and he's not level 90
[02:10:20] You' do a lot more damage if he was cuz
[02:10:22] of the reactions but it's fine let's see
[02:10:24] how it goes
[02:10:28] sorry s is lowkey going to carry us
[02:10:35] here
[02:10:42] your probably should have skilled before
[02:10:44] bursting
[02:10:46] but wait there's actually DEC decent
[02:10:48] damage
[02:10:53] honestly I just that for ey frames
[02:10:55] probably not smart though cuz we wasted
[02:11:00] damage yo cave you want to get your
[02:11:02] burst man
[02:11:10] nice yeah s's lowkey carrying but C is
[02:11:13] doing

[02:11:46] nice no well Cav is just I he's just Al
[02:11:50] without aly's mirrors and the mirrors
[02:11:52] are a big part of his damage but even
[02:11:54] without it it's fine AL C things for 3
[02:11:57] months just a dead drer for a fourstar

[02:14:54] deepwood I keep forgetting so lowkey we
[02:14:56] haven't really been debuffing the
[02:14:57] enemies cuz I kind of forgot to go
[02:14:59] Kirara um but it's okay maybe it should
[02:15:01] be on cave in hindsight any it's
[02:15:08] nice not bad definitely could have done
[02:15:11] more damage though if we had better dut
[02:15:12] off time that's on me that is my bad
[02:15:14] Hydro TOA [ __ ] you this guy can do a lot
[02:15:17] of damage to us

[02:15:39] that
[02:15:40] attack he does oh [ __ ] he
[02:15:44] does but the hit doesn't go until the
[02:15:48] and I dodged too early because my
[02:15:49] reaction time is too good so we're going
[02:15:50] to boom boom then we're going to do this
[02:15:53] I could have eat first but it's fine
[02:15:59] boom perfect Dodges perfect

[02:17:26] trying he's actually trying okay this
[02:17:28] team is a quick swap team which means
[02:17:29] you have to constantly EQ EQ EQ I need
[02:17:31] to okay I'll use my eye frames
[02:17:33] efficiently now
[02:17:34] watch efficient eye frame usage watch
[02:17:38] this also my rosar is on an em goblet
[02:17:41] sorry Em stand which usually is really
[02:17:43] good on this team if you're vaping right
[02:17:45] or sorry melting but you can't really
[02:17:46] melt against an enemy that's Hydro so uh
[02:17:49] we're losing out on a lot of damage
[02:17:53] potential nice
[02:17:59] Dodge like you a little my Bennett oh it
[02:18:02] didn't expire I just could see it oh
[02:18:03] it's fine good eye frame usage by the

[02:18:12] nice wait so far so good so far oh I'm
[02:18:15] about to M Dodge
[02:18:22] I don't know if I got my Kay e off or
[02:18:23] not wait this is actually perfect this
[02:18:25] is actually such good gameplay all the
[02:18:26] comments would be like wow despite the
[02:18:28] failed attempts at the start he's
[02:18:30] actually so good at dodging that his
[02:18:31] skill really showed off in this Abyss I
[02:18:35] wish one day to be as good as Z second
[02:18:37] half we're going to start with Kirara
[02:18:38] cuz I don't remember what the enemies
[02:18:39] are okay that's what they are it's fine
[02:18:40] we're going to get deot on
[02:18:45] them uh too many cores here
[02:18:50] can they group yes or
[02:18:52] no should I bursted earlier they're not
[02:18:55] going to [ __ ] they're knocking a
[02:18:56] group they're knocking a
[02:19:04] group you see how I alt swap to get ey
[02:19:07] frames yeah yeah yeah that's why you alt
[02:19:09] swap that's why you hold alt press the
[02:19:10] number except that doesn't work 90% of
[02:19:12] the time okay so so good
[02:19:16] Dodge
[02:19:19] good Auto targeting I guess [ __ ]
[02:19:21] hitting a crystal for no
[02:19:27] reason I'm a Catal press one if you're
[02:19:30] totally a
[02:19:34] cat I meant to e not Q
[02:19:40] F come at
[02:19:42] me o look at this look at all these look
[02:19:45] at the plethora of reaction write that
[02:19:47] down p l e t h o r a plethora it means
[02:19:52] like many like like a vast array like a
[02:19:55] wide selection a
[02:20:01] plethora
[02:20:03] boom and our Kaaya I mean sorry our cave
[02:20:07] very underleveled even talent wise nice

[02:20:33] might have been better there but it's
[02:20:34] fine only level 80 should be 90 for
[02:20:36] reactions like Bloom hyper Bloom but
[02:20:37] it's fine uh 667 talents
[02:20:40] C2 we run four star weapons on everyone
[02:20:43] but they have refinements and stuff so
[02:20:44] it's not like a freeo playay build but
[02:20:45] you know this is just our standard
[02:20:47] uh so not bad I I actually purposefully
[02:20:50] took my Rosaria off of our R5 battle
[02:20:53] pass weapon cuz I want it to be a little
[02:20:54] more relatable but Dragon ban was worse
[02:20:56] there cuz we weren't really vaping uh
[02:20:58] melting against the tulpa but normally I
[02:21:00] have her on
[02:21:01] Deathmatch um who else did we use we
[02:21:05] used we used um Kookie just full em zos
[02:21:10] but even iron staying is is like fine it
[02:21:12] does like the same for that uh wol Fang
[02:21:15] R1 twopiece twopiece random [ __ ] on AR
[02:21:17] Kaaya cuz random [ __ ] works what
[02:21:19] else do we have what else do we have we
[02:21:20] didn't play fishal uh we played a level
[02:21:23] 50 do hands assistant on Kirara on
[02:21:25] deepwood again doesn't matter too much
[02:21:29] um Bennett was on sapwood blade no Bless
[02:21:33] oblig yeah no oblig sapwood
[02:21:37] blade and then I think that was
[02:21:40] it oh Shang Ling Shang the catch four
[02:21:45] emblem pretty good ratio when you factor
[02:21:47] in the crit you get from the
[02:21:50] catch
[02:21:53] yeah so pretty good teams overall very
[02:21:55] happy with it now let's do maybe another
[02:21:57] clear who should we
[02:22:00] play are you the Gojo of genin
[02:22:04] impact Yes
[02:22:14] actually um
[02:22:30] I mean we could do
[02:22:32] like like a sucros official team we
[02:22:36] about like
[02:22:41] Quicken like like but there's no like
[02:22:44] bet doesn't really work here because
[02:22:46] it's one enemy doesn't work as
[02:23:00] well dude we're going to play the same
[02:23:02] [ __ ] team second half no honestly it
[02:23:04] would end up being the same teams cuz if
[02:23:06] we do a force arle again it would
[02:23:07] literally be
[02:23:16] this
[02:23:19] ning Wong
[02:23:42] um I don't know how I feel about
[02:23:46] this
[02:24:04] I feel like this right
[02:24:07] now um we
[02:24:12] probably I mean I could also do
[02:24:16] like
[02:24:18] can also do an Avia clear because she's
[02:24:20] new again I don't think I played her
[02:24:21] second even though there's a bunch of
[02:24:23] Geo [ __ ]

[02:34:27] value but it's okay it's
[02:34:44] okay wait what that is my ya ya

[02:38:23] struggling to do anything I can't
[02:38:38] lie why do you need deepwood when solo
[02:38:40] dendro because we're not actually
[02:38:43] playing an electro team we're playing
[02:38:45] hyp hyper Bloom and Hyper Bloom's

[02:39:50] do Barbara Vape Barbara Crown Vape
[02:39:54] barbar with strangling Bennett and
[02:39:55] usually I do suas but I can't probably
[02:39:58] down honestly we could do Lynette but I

[02:40:09] y I don't know if Dona actually does
[02:40:11] anything though it's literally just
[02:40:14] Yem I mean energy too and a shield but
[02:40:17] we don't need the shield cuz I'm never
[02:40:19] going to die anyways sure that's
[02:40:26] right you need a claymore true but not
[02:40:30] if we're skilled and that's a problem
[02:40:32] we'll figure out how to break the Geo
[02:40:34] Shields when we get there that's a
[02:40:34] problem for another day did anyone tell
[02:40:36] you that you would look like Velma I

[04:15:22] there too [ __ ]
[04:15:24] it no surely
[04:15:34] not Chad I was talking about this
[04:15:38] earlier I was talking about this earlier
[04:15:41] I might unironically do a thing that's
[04:15:43] popular with other games but no one's
[04:15:44] done with genin to my knowledge which is
[04:15:47] reacting to your clips of Abyss clears
[04:15:51] so you're going to I'm going to open a
[04:15:52] form in Discord probably the last one
[04:15:55] was for account review I never ended up
[04:15:56] doing it so rip Bozo anyways is what it
[04:15:58] is we will do it eventually where you
[04:16:00] send me your Abyss clears either good or
[04:16:03] cursed probably we'll do cursed ones I
[04:16:05] think it'll be more entertaining like
[04:16:06] you can't fully clear you can't 36r or
[04:16:08] you do 36r whatever it
[04:16:10] is uh and you'll record yourself
[04:16:13] clearing the abyss or trying to maybe
[04:16:15] he'll get like one star two star three
[04:16:18] star and then you send it and then we
[04:16:20] react to it on stream I think that would
[04:16:22] be a good idea I don't know if it would
[04:16:23] be like good content or not but I think
[04:16:24] it be a good
[04:16:31] idea Curr like exclamation mark Discord
[04:16:33] or I'm prettyy sure just SL like zyx or
[04:16:36] zerox okay I'm Auto battling XP books
[04:16:38] I'm
[04:16:41] sorry
[04:16:43] also no that's
[04:16:46] it why is Nita in this
