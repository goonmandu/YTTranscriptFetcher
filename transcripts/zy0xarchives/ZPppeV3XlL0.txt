[00:16:23] um it was on Dory cuz my Dory is my
[00:16:26] placeholder
[00:16:27] Navia anyway uh gen impact apparently
[00:16:30] apparently apparently
[00:16:34] apparently there are two new
[00:16:37] characters we'll talk about the pretty
[00:16:39] one
[00:16:42] first
[00:16:44] Bayonetta is being added to
[00:16:50] genjin Cloud retainer Shan Yun I think
[00:16:53] I'm not too sure how to pronounce it but
[00:16:55] I'll learn Cloud retainer first of all
[00:16:58] looking second of all looking third of
[00:17:02] all this means so here's the first thing
[00:17:06] that came to my mind oh my God we are
[00:17:09] finally getting a Lee
[00:17:12] uan an Nemo character that isn't Shia do
[00:17:15] you know what that means Shia on the
[00:17:17] lithic spear can finally work Shia dude
[00:17:20] lithic spear can't work with like it's
[00:17:23] fine on child but there's never been an
[00:17:25] anemo support but now maybe we don't
[00:17:27] know what she does there might be
[00:17:29] anyways I digress uh hopefully she works
[00:17:32] for Shia no leaks no dreams we do not
[00:17:35] talk about those but I would love it if
[00:17:38] she did I would love it hey I would love
[00:17:42] it
[00:17:43] anyways
[00:17:45] anyways anyways look at her chat I like
[00:17:49] her I think she's sick she reminds me of
[00:17:51] Maki is that her name I don't
[00:17:53] know anyways I think she's cool um I
[00:17:56] mean obviously she's very
[00:17:58] how do I say
[00:18:00] this obviously like I'm talking outside
[00:18:02] of her personality I'm
[00:18:04] saying I'm saying if what the [ __ ] why
[00:18:06] won it zoom in bro what I'm
[00:18:10] saying I'm saying like like if this is
[00:18:12] all I see from
[00:18:14] her anemo
[00:18:17] Supremacy if this is all I could see
[00:18:21] respectfully i' be like okay she's
[00:18:22] pretty cool I like her hair let me show
[00:18:24] no let me show you her hair her hair is
[00:18:26] really cool there's a lot of colors I'm
[00:18:27] saying just like just like I like I
[00:18:31] think it's very cool okay she has I
[00:18:33] think she's sick uh and hope she looks
[00:18:36] like she's built like not built she
[00:18:38] looks like she's designed support
[00:18:41] character Vibe esque so hopefully she is
[00:18:43] so I can use her in my sh team and uh
[00:18:47] yes anyways obviously they they made her
[00:18:51] personalities overwhelming but that's
[00:18:54] I'm respectful so we don't talk about
[00:18:55] that uh but it's the the common theme of
[00:18:57] the Shen H uh family or the cloud
[00:19:00] retainer family
[00:19:03] anyways uh then there's this guy Lion
[00:19:05] Man or
[00:19:08] boy
[00:19:10] dude bro he
[00:19:14] looks what the yo this guy I don't he
[00:19:17] looks like he's like six characters
[00:19:18] combined but I don't know which ones he
[00:19:21] has like the BET hair Vibes and then
[00:19:23] like jzo Bennett I don't know I don't
[00:19:25] know um but there's also this guy who uh
[00:19:32] I've been told is pronounced gaming but
[00:19:34] it's ridden gaming um because they
[00:19:36] didn't put a space so gaming
[00:19:39] um yeah so we're getting two characters
[00:19:42] I kind of don't give up like if he's fun
[00:19:44] if he's cool cool as of right now I
[00:19:46] don't really give a [ __ ] I think the
[00:19:47] lion mask thing is
[00:19:50] cool but Cloud
[00:19:51] retainer so we'll see hopefully they're
[00:19:54] they're good
[00:19:57] um
[00:20:00] yeah okay also the problem I'm going to
[00:20:02] say this the problem with them not
[00:20:03] putting a space between GA and Ming like
[00:20:06] G and Ming is that now when you title a
[00:20:09] video it's going to be called gaming
[00:20:10] guide cuz you can't like that's just
[00:20:13] what people are going to look up like
[00:20:15] Alam didn't put a space so I I put it
[00:20:17] together because there should be a space
[00:20:18] but anyways so it's just G to [ __ ] with
[00:20:21] every search Eng like it's it's [ __ ] I
[00:20:23] but whatever I mean that's on them not
[00:20:26] like I don't know why they wouldn't just
[00:20:28] [ __ ] space but it's
[00:20:31] fine it's okay um or a cap yeah a
[00:20:36] capital yeah they could also just
[00:20:37] Capital that letter but I mean
[00:20:42] yeah it's fine gaming review I don't
[00:20:47] know doesn't really matter uh okay Navia
[00:20:49] is here apparently I'm late so my bad
[00:20:52] but that's all we needed to recap
[00:20:55] on I also want her Axe really badly I
[00:20:57] was I was going to stream me preparing
[00:20:59] for Navia but I don't know what happened
[00:21:00] I
[00:21:12] didn't I like how every time you talk
[00:21:14] about the character the like whole
[00:21:15] Avengers Assemble on how you're supposed
[00:21:17] to pronounce it or write it and like
[00:21:19] everyone disagrees it's
[00:21:22] it's it's

[00:22:50] ready are you ready wait how the [ __ ] do
[00:22:51] I crystallize with this I guess ning
[00:22:54] Wong everybody stand back
[00:23:00] we oh I have no
[00:23:05] crystals fire oh yeah she also screams
[00:23:08] fire when she SS for some reason
[00:23:22] fire
[00:23:26] with
[00:23:30] out so yes
[00:23:34] um we can talk about
[00:23:38] her the AL deals no damage the alt is to
[00:23:40] help you crystallize her she's like you
[00:23:42] no she's not she's not but her skill is
[00:23:46] like
[00:23:47] n it's only like 60% of her damage I
[00:23:49] think but it it it feels like 90 like
[00:23:52] it's most of her damage most of her
[00:23:53] damage is her skill then it infuses her
[00:23:56] normals for 4 seconds and her her burst
[00:23:58] Rains Down cannon fire but it's mostly
[00:24:01] just to help you get more Geo more
[00:24:02] crystallize and it gives you stacks for
[00:24:05] your your skill cuz it counts as
[00:24:07] crystallize so a lot of her damage comes
[00:24:10] from just pressing your skill she
[00:24:11] doesn't have she has a weird feel time
[00:24:13] requirement where she wants to be on
[00:24:14] field for like 8 seconds or like 12 but
[00:24:17] not like 15 or whatever like a bit less
[00:24:20] than most people but that makes her very
[00:24:22] quick swappable you can kind of do
[00:24:24] whatever you want with her which is
[00:24:25] pretty cool uh and all of her damage is
[00:24:27] from loaded so usually which means but
[00:24:30] it's okay it's front loaded but it's
[00:24:31] front loaded on a 9-second cool down
[00:24:33] which means like let's say you skill and
[00:24:35] then you're about to swap out cuz
[00:24:37] usually you have two skill casts so
[00:24:40] usually you save two per rotation you do
[00:24:42] two then you swap out then you do
[00:24:44] whatever then you come back you do two
[00:24:46] rinse and repeat but because her damage
[00:24:50] such a big chunk like 200k 100 to 200k
[00:24:53] comes from just pressing your skill at
[00:24:56] c0 you can like yo a skill from your
[00:24:59] next rotation and clear enemies a lot
[00:25:01] faster if you can clear in like 1.5 or
[00:25:04] in 2.5 or whatever so sometimes you can
[00:25:08] like extend your rotations on her which
[00:25:09] makes her flexible and very
[00:25:11] cool I think through my experience we're
[00:25:14] going to play her today I think even
[00:25:17] though I talked about this in my guide
[00:25:18] which will be out later uh I think it's
[00:25:22] people over exaggerate how she's like
[00:25:24] needs field time but doesn't need field
[00:25:26] time because the more you play her at
[00:25:28] least for me it felt like she actually
[00:25:29] does want to be on field but she doesn't
[00:25:31] have to be because you can swap out
[00:25:33] because most of damage comes skill so
[00:25:34] yeah uh there's a [ __ ] axe we're
[00:25:36] going to get this by the way we're going
[00:25:38] to oh yeah I wanted to stream to do a
[00:25:39] banner review I forgot but then I didn't
[00:25:43] anyways uh this Banner is okay well the
[00:25:45] axe and misl are really good and then
[00:25:46] akumaru is cracked uh well for certain
[00:25:49] characters it's really good and then
[00:25:51] Dragon yeah dragons B
[00:25:55] flute and then four stars are decent
[00:25:57] rosar is good C2 is good Candace is
[00:25:59] pretty pretty okay like she got better
[00:26:01] like you know you play like nilu ya yaa
[00:26:02] she's right like she used to be kind of
[00:26:04] whatever but then with some dental
[00:26:05] characters should got better um C6 gets
[00:26:09] better and then sucrose is cracked but
[00:26:10] doesn't really need constellations so
[00:26:12] well C1 helps and then C6 can help
[00:26:15] anyways
[00:26:16] [Applause]
[00:26:19] navio ready
[00:26:22] chat should I pull axe if I already have
[00:26:25] Mis spitter no absolutely not if you
[00:26:27] want it sure cuz it's a [ __ ] axe I
[00:26:29] would but you shouldn't because serpent
[00:26:31] spine is about as good if you have it R5
[00:26:33] and sometimes even better with that in
[00:26:35] mind it's a battle pass weapon do I
[00:26:36] recommend you buy five battle passes no
[00:26:38] but if you have it it can lowkey be
[00:26:39] better than a signature depending uh
[00:26:41] sometimes especially if you have Bennett
[00:26:42] in your team which you often times will
[00:26:44] very good weapon very very good
[00:26:49] weapon sack we're going to test sack I
[00:26:51] don't know if it's the Jeff copium or
[00:26:53] actually good it's definitely good if

[00:26:56] you're playing her solo like at that

[00:35:10] Shades I like that the opposite of
[00:35:15] alham true okay uh let me fit her into
[00:35:19] every single team I made so all of these
[00:35:22] teams I mean my Navia gu is going to be
[00:35:24] out soon but in case you're wondering
[00:35:26] all of these are Navia
[00:35:28] teams um you can also play Navia with
[00:35:31] Noel but my Noel is level 40 so I will
[00:35:33] let other players the rec Crafters uh
[00:35:37] Gamers the on the case do
[00:35:40] that but I will level my Noel theas on
[00:35:43] the case the Spa's on the
[00:35:45] case wait who's on the case I'll take
[00:35:48] the lead [ __ ] wait a second I forgot
[00:35:50] who's on the case Count Me In [ __ ] who's
[00:35:53] on who's on the case again Thea's on the
[00:35:56] case
[00:35:57] okay this one isn't really a team this
[00:35:59] is experimental I don't think she works
[00:36:01] here but I want to try it same with
[00:36:02] these characters I don't know if she
[00:36:04] works but I want to try it but the first
[00:36:06] two teams are legit like these ones are
[00:36:08] legit uh we're going to play this
[00:36:13] one I kind of want to play ALB
[00:36:24] actually pull for axe oh oh I forgot
[00:36:27] well okay we're going to play with
[00:36:28] servant spine anyways I already recorded
[00:36:30] my Showcase with servant spine cuz it's
[00:36:31] like lowkey better and it's not a five
[00:36:33] star but well it is a battle pass uh but
[00:36:36] I could pull the axxe it is very pretty
[00:36:37] I really want the axe I
[00:36:39] might okay chat the only oh I didn't
[00:36:42] [ __ ] I need to top up well I think I
[00:36:43] might have topped up
[00:36:45] actually okay the only problem
[00:36:49] is the only problem is are we going to
[00:36:53] is there like a challenge we're going to
[00:36:54] do where I'm going to have to pull cuz
[00:36:55] if yes I'll save it but if not gazing up
[00:36:59] at eternity oh this wait this is [ __ ]
[00:37:09] sick we're going to put this in game
[00:37:11] we're going to put
[00:37:16] this apparently it's like a huge morax
[00:37:18] St it's actually really cool you guys
[00:37:19] should go get it anyways
[00:37:22] um I have heard about
[00:37:25] it let me gear her and then we'll talk
[00:37:27] okay cuz I don't want to have to oh
[00:37:31] [ __ ] okay listen I pre geared all my
[00:37:36] characters before starting I pre geared
[00:37:38] everyone so you guys can be like oh my
[00:37:39] God gearing oh my God I did okay I
[00:37:42] literally geared and she gets with F I
[00:37:45] literally put my [ __ ] Jonathan on I
[00:37:47] put J Le on [ __ ] geog goblet so that
[00:37:49] my burst actually does damage I put
[00:37:51] Bennett on [ __ ] no Bless but with
[00:37:53] skywards that I have enough ER even if
[00:37:55] my team sucks balls
[00:37:57] because I want to heal enough for finina
[00:37:58] I know there's like downtime and nav
[00:38:00] rotations where you can heal on each
[00:38:01] character but it's kind of in practice I
[00:38:03] don't know wait why is he on wait 329
[00:38:05] wait never mind I'm on the wrong no no
[00:38:06] okay anyways
[00:38:08] um yeah so I geared everyone now the
[00:38:11] problem with Navia run her on for glad I
[00:38:14] don't even mention for glad I was I
[00:38:16] literally when I was recording I was
[00:38:17] like hm should I mention for glad bide
[00:38:20] and husk and then I thought about it I'm
[00:38:21] like bro if you're using those sets just
[00:38:23] [ __ ] go substats so I literally
[00:38:25] edited it out I don't even think they're
[00:38:27] worth mentioning but I mean maybe glad
[00:38:29] cuz it's such an old set maybe maybe
[00:38:32] glad the rest I don't think so maybe
[00:38:34] glad maybe but it's not it's like at
[00:38:38] least 10 to I think 15% worse than
[00:38:40] Alternatives but anyways this is felds
[00:38:43] crafting the math will be when the video
[00:38:44] is out but anyways uh I am going to use
[00:38:50] Mari when I
[00:38:52] play oh yeah I just got this I'm going
[00:38:55] to play
[00:38:57] Mar when I use finina because it's
[00:39:00] Nava's best in slot with finina now her
[00:39:03] new sets are best in slot overall but
[00:39:05] with finina m is about as good slightly
[00:39:08] better in fact depending on substats
[00:39:10] than the new resin black hole of a set
[00:39:13] now the problem for me though is I going
[00:39:15] to test na'vi on like 50 teams which
[00:39:17] means I don't want to have to gear each
[00:39:19] time so I'm going to keep around golden
[00:39:20] and then if we play with fin later and
[00:39:22] like Abyss clear I might swap to
[00:39:25] Mari
[00:39:27] that's all balls wait what the [ __ ]
[00:39:30] ciret am I using I'm pretty sure it's
[00:39:32] crit
[00:39:35] damage where's Dory there she
[00:39:44] is we get crit damage from ascending oh
[00:39:47] wait there's this I forgot okay I am
[00:39:49] about to rant first of all let's do the
[00:39:51] there's the good the bad the ugly we
[00:39:53] might also pull for the axe but let's
[00:39:54] talk about this this is important
[00:39:55] there's a good there's a bad and there's
[00:39:57] an ugly first of all this is sick okay
[00:40:00] this feels like a company actually cares
[00:40:01] about us because oh look at how convened
[00:40:04] this is Boom there should been out eight
[00:40:06] patches too boom cool right cool now
[00:40:11] this is really sick now you are the ugly
[00:40:15] I
[00:40:17] assume
[00:40:19] listen here is what isn't as
[00:40:24] sick now this might be
[00:40:28] this is probably something I'm going to
[00:40:29] get used to and probably something that
[00:40:32] only affects me and people who want to
[00:40:35] make like like for like streams and
[00:40:37] content when you level the artifact let
[00:40:40] me just do this this is really cool by
[00:40:41] the way there's 15 and you can enhance
[00:40:43] next year that is sick huge W
[00:40:49] but it's like look look it's faster sure
[00:40:53] but it's so much like it's faster which
[00:40:56] is is cool but it like ruins the hype
[00:40:59] for for like I don't know for Content
[00:41:02] it's so much worse but I I like if I'm
[00:41:04] like I like it's fine it's fine and I'm
[00:41:08] sure I'll get used to it but for Content
[00:41:11] it's so much dude there's no P be like
[00:41:13] boom it's
[00:41:15] just but it's okay I'm not a
[00:41:18] complaining actually I am complaining
[00:41:21] but it's it's
[00:41:23] fine like I think the thing is I think
[00:41:25] it's nice if I'm like playing casually
[00:41:28] which is most like 99% of people so it's
[00:41:30] fine but I'm like [ __ ] I wish I could
[00:41:33] have the popup cuz look look let's say
[00:41:35] let's say this get crit rate right you
[00:41:36] won't even notice it look it's about to
[00:41:38] get crit rate you didn't even know wait
[00:41:40] it got crit rate what the [ __ ] but see
[00:41:42] dude there was
[00:41:45] no you see what I
[00:41:48] mean but I think for videos I'll just
[00:41:52] like whoever edits it will just like
[00:41:54] zoom in or if I'm editing it I'll just
[00:41:55] zoom in in and it'll be fine cuz we
[00:41:57] could just zoom in to top right but for
[00:41:58] streams it's like harder to show I don't
[00:42:00] know
[00:42:01] whatever okay plus eight it got crit
[00:42:05] damage okay this is still hard for me to
[00:42:07] get used to uh we're going to enhance it
[00:42:09] to the next TI once whoa it's fine wait
[00:42:12] no no no I shouldn't do that I shouldn't
[00:42:13] do
[00:42:14] that swipe to quickly select multiple

[00:42:38] Mora Max okay it's a start also I rolled
[00:42:40] this off stream so we're going to throw
[00:42:43] it

[00:43:16] I forgot wait this only had this didn't
[00:43:18] have crit raid by the way this one also
[00:43:20] had only crit damage I rolled it off
[00:43:21] stream it got crit raate and then I just
[00:43:22] rolled this one wait that's
[00:43:25] pog
[00:43:26] this one's better it has ER and more
[00:43:28] crit value it's actually good also
[00:43:34] um my Navia has been running on 105 ER
[00:43:38] and I was perfectly fine but I I think
[00:43:39] she needs like 120 to 140 but I've been
[00:43:42] using literally no ER and it's been fine
[00:43:45] I don't know I think it's cuz I'm
[00:43:46] running a fa Le um but yeah happy
[00:43:51] birthday he okay okay
[00:43:55] okay
[00:43:56] I haven't decided chat
[00:44:02] um look I know I want the axe I know and
[00:44:07] Miss spitter my IO is rank two probably
[00:44:11] rank one in the world on Miss
[00:44:15] spitter the only thing is I don't know
[00:44:17] if I should save this for another
[00:44:22] time chat we might have to raise the
[00:44:24] price of VIP redeem I know a lot of
[00:44:26] people are saving for it but I I VIP
[00:44:28] like three new people that I don't know
[00:44:30] and hey they're probably great people
[00:44:32] but I'm just
[00:44:33] saying save it for the content dude
[00:44:36] there's no content though but also
[00:44:39] here's the thing I feel like if I want
[00:44:42] to pull and it's a challenge like if I
[00:44:44] die pull then it's not like a CH it's
[00:44:45] not like a downside so I need it to be
[00:44:47] like pulling when I don't want to
[00:44:52] pull like example we get the axxe and
[00:44:56] and then we do it for Mis
[00:45:00] flitter don't give up on us coming up
[00:45:02] with an idea okay that is facts oh chat
[00:45:06] what do you guys think one sec not not
[00:45:08] stalling by the way what do you guys
[00:45:09] think about a video not stalling someone
[00:45:11] redem tenple okay well we have to I'll
[00:45:14] do it listen no no stalling by the way
[00:45:18] what do you guys think of the idea of
[00:45:20] beating floor 12 with every single
[00:45:24] character in the game
[00:45:26] without using duplicate characters on
[00:45:28] either team which means I use Sr once I
[00:45:30] can't use them ever again and I don't
[00:45:34] know if the next part is possible but if
[00:45:35] possible and I can't swap artifacts off
[00:45:39] anyone everyone has to be geared I need
[00:45:41] to level like 70 or 60 how many
[00:45:43] characters 70 70 Time 4 artifacts think
[00:45:45] about that think about that think about
[00:45:48] that times five not four think about
[00:45:52] that think about that that's imposs
[00:45:55] possible because half your artifacts are
[00:45:57] [Music]
[00:45:59] echoes mods find
[00:46:03] his find find his location then don't
[00:46:09] send it to anyone don't talk to them
[00:46:10] don't do that then go there take their
[00:46:12] pillow right take his pillow remove the
[00:46:15] pillowcase put on a new one that's a bit
[00:46:17] less comfy and then make sure it's warm
[00:46:20] put a heater in under the pillow hide it
[00:46:23] in integrate it into the pillowcase so
[00:46:25] that the pillow is always warm on both
[00:46:27] sides then then unplug their take their
[00:46:30] phone charger tangle it a little to
[00:46:32] where it only charges at a specific
[00:46:34] angle then what you want to do is plug
[00:46:37] that back into the wall in a loose way
[00:46:40] where it's going to fall out when they
[00:46:41] plug their phone in and then they're
[00:46:42] going to have to go and be inconvenience
[00:46:44] because their phone won't actually work
[00:46:46] anymore it won't charge they think it
[00:46:47] will charge but it won't charge properly
[00:46:49] so they'll miss their alarm won't go off
[00:46:51] next morning they're going to miss their
[00:46:53] flight miss their their ride to work
[00:46:55] their boss like listen here this is the
[00:46:57] sixth time you've been late fired lose
[00:47:00] their job all because I don't remember
[00:47:02] what their message was but they chose to
[00:47:04] make a
[00:47:07] joke all right verdict uh we'll do a
[00:47:09] Tempo uh I think we're gonna
[00:47:13] um okay okay here's what I'm going to do
[00:47:16] I will pull until
[00:47:18] five mods don't get paid enough for that
[00:47:21] buddy I'm not going to keep going if we
[00:47:24] lose because I think we're going to save
[00:47:26] pulls for the video I'm going to
[00:47:29] make
[00:47:32] but please don't throw a video
[00:47:37] but we could get like we could do one
[00:47:40] temple one Temple never hurt nobody also
[00:47:42] someone redeemed it yeah I have someone
[00:47:44] redeemed it we're just doing one
[00:47:54] time

[00:59:13] resets [ __ ] cool Downs
[00:59:17] finally it's I have been asking for this
[00:59:22] for years and they listen
[00:59:32] yes
[00:59:35] okay
[00:59:39] NPC nav is really fun but I haven't had
[00:59:42] time to play on stream so we'll get into
[00:59:44] it uh okay this is like the biggest
[00:59:46] disclaimer ever I'm going to say right
[00:59:53] now
[01:00:02] [Applause]
[01:00:10] zated out his evil conquering all over
[01:00:13] stream sorry I got distracted I wanted
[01:00:15] to write something down before I forgot
[01:00:17] uh this is a big disclaimer Navia is
[01:00:20] actually pretty good we'll talk about it
[01:00:21] but her skill does like a m like a big
[01:00:25] number and do you guys remember what
[01:00:27] happened with the last character who did
[01:00:28] a big
[01:00:31] number do you guys remember uh the
[01:00:33] clickbait that ensued just be careful
[01:00:36] she's good okay like I'm saying this I
[01:00:38] like her and because you can frontload
[01:00:40] her damage and actually like extend your
[01:00:41] Rotation by using an extra skill you can
[01:00:43] actually get a lot more value than you
[01:00:45] would like get theoretically like the
[01:00:47] like charted like DPS isn't her DPS will
[01:00:51] be higher than like the math DPS if you
[01:00:53] can end a rotation after using your
[01:00:54] skill but just keep in mind that the
[01:00:56] clickbait of big number applies to her
[01:01:00] just keep that in mind but it is a
[01:01:02] 9-second cool down not a [ __ ] 20
[01:01:04] right or 18 20 right 80 energy
[01:01:10] cost are we fully geared 74 231 probably

[01:02:28] there's
[01:02:32] some you may have escaped my pun last
[01:02:35] time but you definitely won't this time
[01:02:38] why do Norwegian ships have bar codes so
[01:02:41] they can
[01:02:43] Scandinavian did you just om your own
[01:02:48] joke anyways
[01:02:50] uh also yeah she probably will have have
[01:02:58] um what was I going to say yeah her
[01:03:00] scaling for those of you who don't
[01:03:02] actually know her scaling is like her
[01:03:05] the scaling on her skill is like at
[01:03:07] level 10 I think it's over 700 but
[01:03:09] anyways uh let's say let's say 700 it
[01:03:11] gets doubled so it's effectively
[01:03:14] 1,400 uh cuz you double it like when you
[01:03:16] press it if you are not if your bullets
[01:03:18] hit it gets doubled and then you get
[01:03:20] damage bonus as well so it's basically
[01:03:23] 1,400 scaling like motion value which is
[01:03:26] a lot that's a lot of damage and if you
[01:03:29] are um using like golden true it's a lot
[01:03:33] of
[01:03:35] damage and what's nice about her is that
[01:03:39] she's the least Geo geoc character that
[01:03:41] is probably her biggest strong suit
[01:03:43] because she wants to crystallize which
[01:03:45] means she's not designed around running
[01:03:47] a [ __ ] mono [ __ ] yellow physical
[01:03:50] team like all the other GEOS oh oh if
[01:03:52] you play eight GEOS gain crit damage
[01:03:54] [ __ ] you na' he's like okay play me with
[01:03:56] one other Geo I'm fine play like Electro
[01:03:58] with me play like Hydro with me [ __ ]
[01:04:00] put Shang Ling next to me she's fine
[01:04:01] with that she doesn't need eight [ __ ]
[01:04:03] GEOS in your team which is cool in fact
[01:04:06] she doesn't want more than one goo
[01:04:08] unless like there's one exception which
[01:04:10] is Noel
[01:04:11] Goro uh that team's actually not bad
[01:04:13] Noel Goro finina but outside of that
[01:04:15] it's usually Navia and then either one
[01:04:18] Gio or no Gio other than her usually one
[01:04:20] but you can do only her Gio especially
[01:04:23] like Sac great we'll test that that's
[01:04:24] the one thing I need to test more but in
[01:04:26] theory it should work so I don't see why
[01:04:28] I would be wrong I could be wrong o Act
[01:04:31] of the guilty oh okay uh enemies what
[01:04:35] the [ __ ] oh this kind of this cool I
[01:04:37] forgot they change this not
[01:04:39] bad where are the [ __ ] the where are
[01:04:42] the [ __ ] operations oh there
[01:04:46] there a non donated one how good is this
[01:04:50] weapon Banner can you talk about how
[01:04:52] flexible the new weapon is is or
[01:04:55] not it has a really high base
[01:04:58] attack low crit value but well not low
[01:05:02] it's 22 crit rate it's it's good it's a
[01:05:04] lot of stats it's better on attack
[01:05:06] Skilling characters because it has a
[01:05:07] high Bas stack and it gives you 20%
[01:05:09] attack uh the skill damage part is like
[01:05:11] more or less relevant it's really good
[01:05:13] for Navia but for a lot of characters
[01:05:14] it's kind of whatever but it is pretty
[01:05:16] good like it's genuinely pretty decent
[01:05:18] uh because the base Stack's High it can
[01:05:20] outperform low Bas stack weapons if
[01:05:21] you're not running an attack buffer like
[01:05:23] Bennett
[01:05:25] um but it's pretty
[01:05:27] decent it's also a [ __ ]
[01:05:34] axe is the unforged good now uh
[01:05:39] unforged it's fine unforge is okay
[01:05:41] unforge is just attack it's
[01:05:47] fine is it good on DPS saou yeah that's
[01:05:52] a bit
[01:05:55] why does it nav dude I navigated to
[01:05:57] crabs and it I don't want to kill the
[01:06:05] seals it's fine I'll kill these
[01:06:07] guys [ __ ] you playing your game a tag
[01:06:10] yeah you're dead
[01:06:12] now yeah now
[01:06:14] what also I was literally farming these
[01:06:17] and then the server reset so I was
[01:06:18] actually trying to have enough but I
[01:06:19] almost have enough we need like two
[01:06:20] Talent levels and we're done and I I
[01:06:22] prearm the books and I prearm I
[01:06:24] literally I literally prearm the axe
[01:06:27] mats I pre-formed my axe to level 90 and
[01:06:30] guess what I didn't get the
[01:06:32] axe unfortunately beacon beacon oh my
[01:06:35] God every day of the week Beacon is so
[01:06:37] dude Beacon is pretty
[01:06:42] cracked Chad is Beacon ever going to
[01:06:45] come back that [ __ ] was on DEA
[01:06:52] Banner dude Beacon and Hunter's path are
[01:06:56] they're just gone bro add them to the
[01:06:57] standard literally add them to the
[01:06:59] standard why wouldn't you they're good
[01:07:01] and they would incent the people would
[01:07:03] be like oh my God maybe I want to pull
[01:07:05] now what the [ __ ] did I just
[01:07:10] do just pull the ax there no
[01:07:14] balls no
[01:07:20] balls do Bennett absolute need for Navia
[01:07:23] no no no no no not at all well okay the
[01:07:27] the problem
[01:07:29] is nav's teams right now are kind of
[01:07:31] like she doesn't really have many teams
[01:07:34] that have good Synergy but it just works
[01:07:36] cuz na'vi is pretty
[01:07:38] good uh the the problem with Bennett is
[01:07:41] like Bennett's okay Bennett's really
[01:07:42] good with
[01:07:44] Navia because there's like no other
[01:07:46] healer that synergizes with Gio very
[01:07:48] much the only problem is finina is also
[01:07:51] really good with Navia but there's no
[01:07:52] healer that synergizes with Gio
[01:07:54] other than Bennett but Bennett doesn't
[01:07:56] cize with finina now the problem is Goro
[01:07:58] is not a Healer don't talk to me he is
[01:08:00] technically but not shut up we'll talk
[01:08:02] about that later just stop talking to me
[01:08:03] okay Bennett works though but Bennett
[01:08:05] with finina usually is like not the best
[01:08:07] Synergy but it can work with Navia
[01:08:09] because she has a bit of downtime in her
[01:08:11] rotation and what you want to do if
[01:08:13] you're playing this team is spend some
[01:08:15] time on each character to let them heal
[01:08:17] a little bit you don't want to spend too
[01:08:18] much time but let's say all your party's
[01:08:20] low cuz uh Fin's crab and [ __ ] drain all
[01:08:24] your energy what you want to do is you
[01:08:25] swap through them while Bennett's field
[01:08:26] is
[01:08:30] up and then that's during your Navia
[01:08:32] downtime now the exception is uh Noel
[01:08:36] you can actually play Navia finina Noel
[01:08:40] and it's actually pretty good na'vi is
[01:08:41] like a a support like a sub DPS there
[01:08:44] where you just burst damage generate a
[01:08:45] [ __ ] ton of energy get the [ __ ] out and
[01:08:47] then no on fields and finina Buster Noel
[01:08:49] and then the last character is flex it'
[01:08:50] be Goro it could be Bennett it's
[01:08:51] actually pretty
[01:08:52] good that that's like the one um the one
[01:08:56] exception to Navia
[01:09:02] teams o sunfire's actually
[01:09:05] uh Sunfire is actually a take of all
[01:09:08] time I actually kind of want to try that
[01:09:10] I didn't think of
[01:09:12] Sunfire huh I'm actually down to try
[01:09:17] Sunfire yeah we'll try
[01:09:22] Sunfire Sunfire Opa dude Sunfire is not
[01:09:26] Shang
[01:09:29] Ling did I just do zero damage to the
[01:09:40] crab uh so Sunfire would be probably
[01:09:43] finina Yen and
[01:09:46] benen where's
[01:09:48] Ben Benny's Adventure team assemble
[01:09:52] you'd Miss [ __ ] fin oh well I I did miss
[01:09:56] you

[01:12:24] anyone that can use it and I don't want

[01:12:33] bunch of
[01:12:35] characters dude serpent fine underwater

[01:14:01] skip button I just dude I just realized
[01:14:04] I just maybe I've been coping for so
[01:14:05] long I just realized after what we went
[01:14:07] through with finina there's no way they
[01:14:10] wouldn't want the average consumer to
[01:14:12] see that it's over it's literally
[01:14:15] over it's over it's actually
[01:14:21] over sad back she seems so happy and
[01:14:23] Goofy oh no yeah yeah happy back yeah

[01:14:27] she's so goofy and silly yeah yeah yeah
[01:14:29] no don't worry happy back story don't
[01:14:31] worry yep yep silly and goofy yep that's

[01:23:40] to no I shouldn't I shouldn't aren't
[01:23:43] there a bunch like at the shore aren't
[01:23:45] there a bunch of crabs like over
[01:23:51] here bro already have her level 80 yeah
[01:23:54] yeah like I pre- farmed everything I
[01:23:55] could 90 her if I want uh I don't really
[01:23:57] want to though not like cuz there's no
[01:23:59] real benefit for just an attack Skilling
[01:24:01] carry like it's a little bit of damage
[01:24:14] but bro what is
[01:24:16] this gu but yeah her Talent okay I'll
[01:24:20] explain what she does in a minute but
[01:24:22] her talents are literally a Yu-Gi-Oh
[01:24:25] essay that I hate how it's written like
[01:24:27] her skill looks so [ __ ] complicated
[01:24:29] but all you do is you just press I and a
[01:24:30] kill stuff well I mean you want
[01:24:32] crystallize I guess but like it's
[01:24:34] literally written like an essay it's
[01:24:36] like yeah it's
[01:24:38] worded it's you shoot a shotgun that has
[01:24:41] multiple bullets so you would assume
[01:24:43] that each bullet does damage but it's
[01:24:46] not that it's like however bullets
[01:24:48] however many bullets you hit will
[01:24:50] increase the one damage number it does
[01:24:53] which isn't a bad thing it's just really
[01:24:54] confusing cuz like I assumed it was like
[01:24:56] okay if I hit them with 11 shots can do
[01:24:58] 11 hits but it's it's one hit it's just
[01:25:01] the damage is
[01:25:02] multiplied or well yeah not exactly
[01:25:06] multiplied but you know what I
[01:25:19] mean yes it's R5 he's a whale I am using
[01:25:23] serpent
[01:25:34] spine are two wolves with her yeah
[01:25:37] that's fine woles is fine with her woles
[01:25:40] is especially good if your off field
[01:25:41] supports scale on attack but it passive
[01:25:44] is inconsistent uh but it depends like
[01:25:46] it depends what content you're doing but
[01:25:48] it's just a [ __ ] SAS
[01:25:51] stick
[01:25:56] that's a whale weapon I mean
[01:25:58] Fair it's a battle
[01:26:00] pass I mean it's not like accessible but
[01:26:03] it's not a five star I mean it might be
[01:26:05] more expensive than a five star if you
[01:26:06] think about it five battle passes well
[01:26:08] not really
[01:26:16] but no I can't I can't I can't I will
[01:26:18] get too much hate for this I'm sorry I'm
[01:26:19] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I can't I
[01:26:21] can't I'm sorry I can't I'm sorry ABA
[01:26:23] minus 15 aboba aboba aboba we
[01:26:27] March almost
[01:26:29] done I have to pee so bad but I'm not
[01:26:32] allowed to until my Navia is fully
[01:26:33] geared wait there's a [ __ ] chest
[01:26:36] there uh let's go murder this
[01:26:42] crab how many dollars is serpent spine
[01:26:45] um well for Canadian currency the battle
[01:26:49] pass would
[01:26:50] be it's 10 bucks right where's the TR
[01:26:53] yeah well 13 Canadian but it says 10
[01:26:55] under my head so it's like 10 times 10
[01:26:57] for one time 5 for refinement
[01:27:01] m284
[01:27:03] 339
[01:27:07] We R five tech is basically 1% worse
[01:27:10] than her weapon yeah it's sometimes
[01:27:11] slightly better sometimes slightly worse
[01:27:13] it's like basically as good as a five
[01:27:16] star weapon that's ra up on a gotra that
[01:27:18] you might get [ __ ]
[01:27:19] on whereas the battle like I'm not like
[01:27:22] obviously spend on what you want to
[01:27:23] spend but like the battle pass is also
[01:27:24] the battle pass so it's like it's a lot
[01:27:26] easier to have a battle pass weapon than
[01:27:27] it is if you're spending if you're not
[01:27:28] spending you can't get it but if you are
[01:27:30] it's easier to get that than a [ __ ]
[01:27:31] limited five star so it
[01:27:33] depends it's 170k Indonesian dollar what
[01:27:37] the [ __ ] wait
[01:27:39] actually what the
[01:27:42] hell

[01:39:14] this bro I have nine free
[01:39:17] PS yo dro the family Mons
[01:39:22] my has been
[01:39:24] obsessing January do you think it's Joe
[01:39:27] ever for
[01:39:29] him
[01:39:31] um feeling lucky feeling lucky your name
[01:39:36] on
[01:39:36] it [ __ ] I thought I would get more
[01:39:38] crystalized but I didn't
[01:39:40] Al or burst I've been playing too much
[01:39:44] starl Warfare I guess bro stop
[01:39:50] running watch
[01:39:55] out also okay so in my I I already
[01:39:58] recorded most of my guide and when I'm
[01:40:00] talking about her like rotations and
[01:40:02] stuff I I I did I drove the let me let
[01:40:05] me okay here's my take I I talked about
[01:40:08] how optimally you want to be doing two
[01:40:09] skills per rotation and then you swap
[01:40:11] out and then you'll when you go back to
[01:40:12] you're about to get your second eback or
[01:40:14] you already have it and then you do two
[01:40:15] e again and then if you can clear in
[01:40:17] like 1.5 rotations or 2.5 whatever you
[01:40:20] can extend your rot do another skill and
[01:40:22] then clear the content with that said in
[01:40:25] my experience in every piece of content
[01:40:28] I've done every single one I've cleared
[01:40:31] with just three e or it's been to the
[01:40:33] point where like maybe I don't but it's
[01:40:34] like waves of content and then it's like
[01:40:36] okay well I want to do another E and
[01:40:37] then I end up doing three e all the time
[01:40:39] so I don't know I feel like two is
[01:40:40] optimal but I always do three so I
[01:40:41] actually don't
[01:40:44] know cuz like even even if it's like
[01:40:47] okay I might not be like like obviously
[01:40:48] I'm high investment but like let's say
[01:40:49] you're not a lot the abyss content
[01:40:51] unless it's like the boss floor like
[01:40:53] first half it's like waves of enemies
[01:40:54] waves of enemies waves of enemies so
[01:40:55] it's like you need time to like reset up
[01:40:58] War guess so I don't
[01:41:03] know are you guys getting a free Five
[01:41:05] Star I mean we got aaka and I I mean so
[01:41:08] there's that I mean you guys didn't but
[01:41:10] I did like like uh if you're ar42 you

[01:43:40] character that feels the less Geo which
[01:43:42] is good the video's an hour
[01:43:45] long D okay I mean if we have time
[01:43:49] maybe I'm not a big react Andy but the
[01:43:52] last video is really good so we
[01:43:55] might C6 vet work no well it would work
[01:43:59] for the last like no it wouldn't only
[01:44:02] after your GE infusion wears
[01:44:12] off okay let's go do ver million it's a
[01:44:16] good domain to test things
[01:44:19] in
[01:44:26] actually okay let's do my it's actually
[01:44:28] better got no time to
[01:44:32] lose
[01:44:35] sorry no I just spilled how the [ __ ] did
[01:44:38] I wait I don't have any [ __ ]
[01:44:39] kleenexes
[01:44:42] wait wait one sec I have toilet paper
[01:44:45] somehow I don't know how this got here
[01:44:48] there we're
[01:44:49] good
[01:44:51] dude my arm smells like
[01:44:54] coffee why you guys typing hot it's
[01:44:56] literally just if you're out dude it's
[01:44:58] literally just
[01:45:05] cheaper she's better than your C6 Tri
[01:45:08] okay you're just
[01:45:17] coping Navia Joo isn't overtaken okay
[01:45:21] I don't have C6 Bennett but I can read
[01:45:24] uh and here it
[01:45:25] says uh this Geo infusion cannot be
[01:45:28] overridden so I assume that no C6 benett
[01:45:31] would not
[01:45:37] work the world can read no weighing
[01:45:42] dude freak
[01:45:46] you
[01:45:49] attack
[01:45:55] hey there hey there
[01:46:02] Thea I want to level nine her skill but
[01:46:05] I'm
[01:46:10] broke how's Beacon compared to axe or
[01:46:12] serpent spine it's pretty good it's uh
[01:46:15] well okay it's not better than the alter
[01:46:17] the weapons you mentioned but it's in
[01:46:18] terms of five stars it's up there
[01:46:21] there will be a weapon right in my video
[01:46:22] I think it's like in terms of five stars
[01:46:24] Beacon and
[01:46:27] um what's the other one I think red horn
[01:46:30] no not red
[01:46:34] horn the [ __ ] are the five star
[01:46:36] Claymores I think it's just yeah I mean
[01:46:38] Beacon's yeah Axe and
[01:46:40] Beacon wolves wolv is
[01:46:44] okay I think most of the five stars are
[01:46:47] okay the crit ones are more valuable cuz
[01:46:48] you're probably running her with Bennett
[01:46:54] probably on Forge is
[01:46:57] okay I might have been think abouto
[01:47:04] sword wait what the how do I do no
[01:47:06] damage I guess it didn't
[01:47:09] crit Warfare I guess I mean I guess

[01:49:44] good this s well yeah this sucks but
[01:49:47] this could be really good okay let's
[01:49:48] we'll level it after I uncap my resin
[01:49:51] I just want to stay
[01:49:53] capped after using Navia do you think
[01:49:55] she revived
[01:49:58] Gio listen here
[01:50:04] brother na Navia Navia doesn't even
[01:50:08] synergize with like okay Navia doesn't
[01:50:13] Navia is Navia okay she's Navia pretend
[01:50:16] she has pretend she has no vision okay
[01:50:19] she she she's good but she's not forcing
[01:50:23] you to play a Geo team okay she might
[01:50:25] want a jongi she might want an
[01:50:29] albo but for the most
[01:50:32] part you put Shang Ling there you put
[01:50:35] SRO there you put FAL there you put
[01:50:37] Bennett there you put [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:50:38] [ __ ] B there you put you put you put
[01:50:40] you put most characters there and the
[01:50:43] team will perform
[01:50:44] fine provided you're buffing her and are
[01:50:47] using a a an a team archetype
[01:50:51] that hey he easy provided you're using a
[01:50:55] team archetype that already Works sing
[01:50:58] yolan finina yolan right A lot of these
[01:51:00] you put a [ __ ] Navia there it'll
[01:51:02] probably work cuz Nava's personal damage
[01:51:04] is pretty good please expain
[01:51:06] crystallized I don't know what it is
[01:51:07] it's nothing it does not
[01:51:09] exist no okay so you okay Geo whoa and
[01:51:13] then an element wo and then it resonates
[01:51:15] and then there's a Shard on the ground
[01:51:16] this [ __ ] Shard you pick it up wa a
[01:51:18] shield that's it that's the literally it
[01:51:20] everybody stand back everybody stand
[01:51:25] back guess was that 344k waa
[01:51:33] Jeep but like here I shouldn't do
[01:51:34] another skill so like in theory you swap
[01:51:36] you would Bena burst you would finina
[01:51:38] burst well other order but finina burst
[01:51:39] Bena burst jly burst like you could jly
[01:51:41] burst in the middle stay in the middle
[01:51:43] then you reset your rotation and then
[01:51:44] you swall back to youra boom I have two
[01:51:45] charges the thing is most of the times
[01:51:47] when I'm doing stuff I clear so fast
[01:51:49] that I I would use three e and then I'll
[01:51:51] be
[01:51:53] done don't apply Geo first okay shut up
[01:51:55] [ __ ] you I don't know why I geed
[01:51:58] first listen okay don't talk to me right
[01:52:00] now you know what I meant finina yeah
[01:52:03] yeah yeah whatever you get
[01:52:14] me opinion about Cloud retainer oh
[01:52:18] uh
[01:52:27] I'll have to know wait to know more
[01:52:29] about her kit before
[01:52:39] commenting how strong is she with a
[01:52:41] signature weapon okay if you're talking
[01:52:42] about
[01:52:44] Navia oh this is another thing okay if
[01:52:47] you're talking about Navia Nava's
[01:52:50] strength with her signature weapon is
[01:52:52] basically in the team I'm running
[01:52:54] basically exactly as good as Navia with
[01:52:57] this weapon basically the only thing is
[01:52:59] her skill will be a bigger number
[01:53:01] because the signature weapon I don't
[01:53:03] know if you can see it from here like
[01:53:05] it's effect um yeah you can it Buffs
[01:53:08] your skill damage by a lot okay you can
[01:53:10] stack 18% times
[01:53:12] two which means you're going to see
[01:53:15] people with this weapon do a bigger
[01:53:17] number does that mean it's necessarily
[01:53:18] better not well like it's slightly
[01:53:21] better but yeah it's it's just like
[01:53:24] bigger
[01:53:26] number but it doesn't like o averaging
[01:53:28] it out it's about as good as her fine
[01:53:30] sometimes a bit better sometimes a bit
[01:53:31] worse usually not a bit worse sometimes
[01:53:33] a bit better or about as
[01:53:40] good but it's a good weapon like it's
[01:53:44] good I want to try uh sack as
[01:53:48] well
[01:53:50] what characters make good use of mist
[01:53:53] splitter everyone literally everyone
[01:53:55] that could use
[01:53:57] crit aaka Ayo alham can um I mean even
[01:54:04] [ __ ] finina can I mean fing desire is
[01:54:06] really good on her but
[01:54:08] like so the well okay not fora but is
[01:54:12] the base Stack's high so it's usually
[01:54:13] like well even Bennett it's usually
[01:54:16] characters that want attack and that
[01:54:18] also want crit so basically any most of
[01:54:21] the sword users
[01:54:24] can Oro even SRO
[01:54:30] can
[01:54:32] Chi-Chi I did not say chii did I mention
[01:54:36] Chi-Chi is Chi-Chi a

[01:57:49] depressing I don't know why I'm here I'm
[01:57:51] going to be
[01:57:53] honest can you rank all font 10
[01:57:56] characters H that sounds like a clip
[01:57:59] that sounds like something that's going
[01:58:00] to get clipped and I'm going to have to
[01:58:01] defend it till the day I die so for now
[01:58:03] I will abstain from doing so but net is
[01:58:05] broken and so is finina I will not
[01:58:07] comment

[01:58:24] sorry easy this
[01:58:31] 6 hi Nick I think we should go to coup's
[01:58:35] counseling I just think our parasocial
[01:58:38] relationship isn't working out it's not
[01:58:41] me it's you for to long you've promised
[01:58:44] Elden ring streams and I am left waiting
[01:58:47] because you haven't put an Elden ring on
[01:58:48] it
[01:58:51] Elden ring will happen okay it will when
[01:58:54] I don't know but I purchased the game
[01:58:56] and I want to play I I played Dark Souls
[01:58:58] 3 I played I played uh I played uh I
[01:59:01] played a bit of uh
[01:59:05] bloodborne I'll I'll play it I just
[01:59:07] don't know
[01:59:09] when it will be before Celestia it will
[01:59:12] fear not also something I want to point
[01:59:15] out is that this Abyss is how how do I
[01:59:19] explain this let's say you're baking a
[01:59:21] cake but you're out of milk and your
[01:59:23] friend's like oh no problem ah no
[01:59:25] problem no and then he hands you a
[01:59:27] mysterious liquid and then you you use
[01:59:29] that instead and you're like dude this
[01:59:31] cake isn't baking what the [ __ ] this
[01:59:32] cake did you give me [ __ ] orange
[01:59:34] juice what the [ __ ] am I making my cake
[01:59:36] with man that is how it currently feels
[01:59:38] to test teams in this Abyss the first
[01:59:40] half you need 86 elements the second
[01:59:42] half you you also need you also want
[01:59:45] Dango Electro and you you don't need it
[01:59:47] I I've cleared it without it but it's
[01:59:49] it's just it's not a fun of this okay
[01:59:52] there's like eight waves of enemies here
[01:59:53] it's disgusting second half is actually
[01:59:55] good for Navia cuz she can burst bosses
[01:59:57] but for this thing you either need to
[01:59:59] like cancel its teleport like it's
[02:00:00] invisible I did that by accident it was
[02:00:02] literally about to TP I did and then
[02:00:04] nav's gunbrella one shotted the thing it
[02:00:06] literally didn't go invisible and then I
[02:00:07] killed it uh and then it destroys the
[02:00:09] Jade plume and then this thing oh my God
[02:00:13] okay whoever designed durge of capellia
[02:00:15] listen here listen here durge of
[02:00:17] capellia first of all [ __ ] you for
[02:00:19] having [ __ ] second of all this
[02:00:21] [ __ ] dancing around the ring if
[02:00:24] he hits if he comes into contact after
[02:00:27] swallow if he comes into contact with
[02:00:30] Jang Le's pillar it it literally
[02:00:32] disappears I am not joking if you jeanly
[02:00:35] pillar and he'll be [ __ ] swinging
[02:00:37] around it he runs into it it's dead he
[02:00:39] slices it it's dead bro I have a clip I
[02:00:41] would show you but I need to sensor the
[02:00:43] the ID before I can but
[02:00:45] literally you don't understand how
[02:00:46] frustrating it is cuz Jong Le's in a a
[02:00:49] Geo team he loses a lot of value if your
[02:00:51] pillar doesn't hit the enemy so you need
[02:00:52] the pillar to be close but it can't be
[02:00:54] too close or it'll break and then if you
[02:00:55] place it at the perfect distance
[02:00:57] sometimes it just [ __ ] breaks
[02:01:08] anyway skill
[02:01:18] issue
[02:01:21] Shia useless
[02:01:24] worthless
[02:01:35] lament where is Navia oh yeah she's only
[02:01:39] level 80 I should probably 90 her just
[02:01:48] cuz

[02:02:44] golden troop two Petra but dude I I
[02:02:47] thought I had good Petra it's so mid
[02:02:49] like imagine dude imagine having good
[02:02:51] Petra in the year of
[02:02:54] 2024 so I don't
[02:03:02] know
[02:03:08] Al dude that's what I'm saying but also
[02:03:11] you okay this is what Gio would be a
[02:03:14] little bit less dog [ __ ] if constructs
[02:03:15] didn't get destroyed by literally the
[02:03:17] wind being too strong okay or a boss
[02:03:19] coughing in your general vicinity
[02:03:21] however however albo Ms you have it a
[02:03:25] lot better than Jong Lee because you can
[02:03:26] do
[02:03:27] this like well it depends where you're
[02:03:29] fighting but like you can put it away
[02:03:31] from the enemies but Jong Lee this
[02:03:33] [ __ ] literally his pillar his
[02:03:35] [ __ ] schlong has to be right next to
[02:03:37] them or nothing happens there
[02:03:41] midnight at
[02:03:46] you com at you
[02:03:52] wait chat watch this watch this watch
[02:03:53] this gaml watch this you guys are not
[02:03:55] ready for what I'm about to do watch
[02:03:56] this watch
[02:04:00] this
[02:04:02] the no wait I worked I thought it was
[02:04:05] physical it worked
[02:04:08] hey
[02:04:10] [Music]
[02:04:16] she we just lamented on Navia with
[02:04:19] nature as one with wind and
[02:04:29] Cloud what the
[02:04:35] [ __ ] I got
[02:04:37] careless I'm I'm fine Tru
[02:04:45] repeat go coming from YouTube how is
[02:04:48] na'vi oh hello welcome to the twitch uh
[02:04:50] Channel if you're from YouTube uh I
[02:04:53] would like you to know that uh this is
[02:04:54] actually a sane uh an educational uh uh
[02:04:58] uh uh twitch stream the guide will be
[02:05:00] out later tonight or tomorrow morning
[02:05:02] Navia feels very fun to play uh she's
[02:05:04] satisfying because her burst of damage
[02:05:06] on her skill comes at a low cooldown and
[02:05:08] is very uh it's good frontload of damage
[02:05:11] it makes you feel good it's a big number
[02:05:13] you just have to make sure it's hitting
[02:05:14] all the pellets it's used sort of like a
[02:05:16] shotgun uh and if you do so she actually
[02:05:18] feels quite nice now is she like uh I
[02:05:20] feel like she might be overly click
[02:05:23] baited in the near future because she
[02:05:25] does do a big number but for the most
[02:05:27] part she's a pretty good DPS it feels uh
[02:05:29] like so far but we are still testing her
[02:05:31] so it is too early to
[02:05:34] judge dude sorry calm down I'm normal uh
[02:05:38] yeah so wait let me get some
[02:05:39] crystallizes you you suck up the
[02:05:41] crystallizes you get more bullets and
[02:05:42] then well bullets and or damage
[02:05:44] depending and then you shoot I need one
[02:05:46] more and then that's it but you don't
[02:05:48] needs to hold you can also just tap hold
[02:05:50] sucks in the crystals so like let's say
[02:05:52] you're like doing this this this this
[02:05:56] and then there's like crystallizes but
[02:05:58] you don't pick okay well I'm already
[02:05:58] full stacked
[02:06:01] so watch this watch this watch this

[02:20:13] honest best weapon for Navia uh her
[02:20:16] signature ax if not Ser SP refin is
[02:20:17] really good about as good honestly as
[02:20:18] actually you don't really need to pull
[02:20:19] for it but it is really good if not you
[02:20:20] can use sack gr or if you're only GI on
[02:20:22] your team but with two Goos I find it to
[02:20:23] be a little copium but you get an extra
[02:20:24] charge so could be fine uh if not the
[02:20:26] free to play weapon is the ultra meal
[02:20:27] Lord Mega lovenia I don't know what it's
[02:20:29] called but it's the meloine sword is
[02:20:30] available through the current event it's
[02:20:31] cardboard you can also use title Shadows
[02:20:33] of free to play option uh or basically
[02:20:34] any five star is pretty decent somewhere
[02:20:36] in the middle there usually under
[02:20:37] serpent spine like a beacon or a statti
[02:20:39] like
[02:20:46] wolves
[02:20:54] I don't have a
[02:20:56] [Applause]
[02:20:58] Healer [ __ ] it finina you're healing
[02:21:05] now fighting
[02:21:08] crit oo that was a lot of
[02:21:10] damage I guess may I first for witness
[02:21:15] my great undertak wait really great
[02:21:18] undertaking
[02:21:20] Roy this one's got your name on
[02:21:23] it hey

[02:21:45] was like why can't I E
[02:21:51] worthless
[02:21:54] worthless I [ __ ] that
[02:21:59] up
[02:22:06] we no need for er uh that's not true so
[02:22:10] why well Navia skill does so much damage
[02:22:13] right you're like oh my God oh my God it
[02:22:14] does so much D but why does it do so
[02:22:15] much damage because crystallize how do
[02:22:18] you crystallize in Lavia your burst and
[02:22:20] your support GE character but you need
[02:22:21] your burst for more Stacks so your burst
[02:22:24] Buffs your skill basically it's kind of
[02:22:26] like why you burst on nevet nevet only
[02:22:28] bursts for the [ __ ] balls you don't
[02:22:30] really care about like the burst damage
[02:22:32] but well like it's it's a bonus it's not
[02:22:34] like bad that's
[02:22:42] nice some redeem 10B did they did it
[02:22:44] earlier and I
[02:22:46] did
[02:22:49] does your burst continue if you switch
[02:22:51] characters her burst wait let me show
[02:22:53] you this her burst isn't a field her Bru
[02:22:56] let me show you
[02:22:57] this it does by the way but let me show
[02:22:59] you this let me show you this let me
[02:23:01] show you
[02:23:04] something her burst doesn't snapshot
[02:23:07] right I need to make
[02:23:16] sure
[02:23:21] you guys want to see something cool
[02:23:23] look so look let's say you burst here
[02:23:26] right it's going to fire at these
[02:23:27] enemies right raining fire if you
[02:23:30] [ __ ]
[02:23:31] teleport watch bur it's not a field it's
[02:23:34] literally some dude with a cannon
[02:23:36] following you
[02:23:42] look so that's pretty
[02:23:45] cool yeah
[02:23:48] literally just some guy with a cannon
[02:23:50] hell yeah brother yeah it's silver and
[02:23:52] Malo I
[02:23:57] I I missed
[02:24:00] them okay back to the
[02:24:05] abys r five serpent or R1 wolves serpent
[02:24:09] wolves can help buff your team
[02:24:16] but
[02:24:21] okay also I need someone with C1 to test
[02:24:24] this for me because obviously I
[02:24:29] can't the C1 through my reading
[02:24:33] comprehension should refund you nine
[02:24:36] energy and 3 seconds cool down per skill
[02:24:39] cast which means if you skill twice it
[02:24:41] should be 18 energy and 6c cool down
[02:24:43] reduction can someone confirm this cuz
[02:24:45] the way it's worded could it I I think
[02:24:47] it means per skill cast this is the max
[02:24:49] you can reduce but it might also be per
[02:24:51] burst but I think it's per skill so if
[02:24:54] someone has C1 let me know but I'm
[02:24:58] pretty sure that's how it works from my
[02:25:00] reading comprehension watch Jo Jeff fit
[02:25:03] zff also doesn't have C1 he also
[02:25:05] probably just reading
[02:25:14] comprehension funds 18 over two e okay
[02:25:16] good
[02:25:20] okay I this we're going to play Navia
[02:25:23] nah via maybe in the second half um
[02:25:27] she's good in both I would
[02:25:34] argue I think first half is more cool
[02:25:37] and cozy because you can reset as you
[02:25:39] want it's the first half but second half
[02:25:42] is a boss and I think Navia is pretty
[02:25:44] pretty good at dealing with one big
[02:25:46] enemy uh because of how her damage works
[02:25:49] or it's pretty good in in like small AOE
[02:25:51] like uh in the in this part when there's
[02:25:53] the two you're jty that's not what they
[02:25:55] say oh what a day and then the two F two
[02:25:57] week pyrro dudes if you group them up
[02:25:59] you can and then if you and then they
[02:26:02] die which is actually not bad but uh for
[02:26:04] like enemies that are far away it's like
[02:26:06] like this part is kind of annoying no
[02:26:08] actually this one's not that bad but
[02:26:10] like this one is
[02:26:13] annoying how much ER for Navia Jong fav
[02:26:18] double Geo okay
[02:26:21] unironically if I'm wrong spank me I
[02:26:24] recommend in my guide ER requirements I
[02:26:27] always change right before uploading but
[02:26:28] like I'm recommending around 120 to 140
[02:26:32] but like I been playing Navia on 105 ER
[02:26:36] with jly and Fa and I've been fine but
[02:26:38] like I
[02:26:40] also scuff my rotations because I'm
[02:26:43] really high investment so I eat three
[02:26:44] times and then before bursting instead
[02:26:46] of two and obviously if you're three
[02:26:47] eing you need like no ER so it's
[02:26:50] like I think it's around 120 to 140 but
[02:26:53] like it could be a lot less if you're
[02:26:56] managing your energy correctly or using
[02:26:58] an extra skill it
[02:27:01] depends maybe
[02:27:04] 110 but
[02:27:07] yeah anyways Navia W Navia yeah woo NAIA
[02:27:12] yeah woo should I play should I play
[02:27:15] Golden Trooper m i could switch to Mar
[02:27:17] right
[02:27:22] now realistically 140 dude I don't even
[02:27:25] like I saw the map okay I saw the ER
[02:27:27] Cals like i' i' i' i' i' I've seen all
[02:27:31] the calculations of what Navia might
[02:27:33] need but I feel like if you go on the
[02:27:34] high end it's like almost not worth it
[02:27:37] like it's not not worth it cuz you want
[02:27:39] to burst but it's like if you need 160
[02:27:42] with another Geo
[02:27:43] character I mean it's probably like it's
[02:27:45] probably like 13
[02:27:47] 3140 with another butt I don't know like
[02:27:51] at that point use fav like at that point
[02:27:54] I would [ __ ] fa albo I don't care
[02:27:56] [ __ ] you fight me I would L [ __ ] you I
[02:27:58] would literally fa my albo fight
[02:28:02] me but yeah I
[02:28:11] mean get have more energy than most cuz
[02:28:13] you clear yeah I know but
[02:28:15] also
[02:28:22] okay let's play um Navia finina wait
[02:28:26] okay I'm going to go M Hunter golden
[02:28:27] troop is is good if I if I'm not playing
[02:28:29] finina but I don't want to change my
[02:28:30] build every time that's why I'm on this
[02:28:32] but if we're playing finina let's
[02:28:33] actually play our best in SL artifact
[02:28:34] set so you guys aren
[02:28:36] like that's what you guys sound like
[02:28:37] that's literally what you guys sound
[02:28:38] like if I'm wrong Sayo you're wrong but
[02:28:41] I know I'm not wrong so don't say that
[02:28:43] why do I have so much ER I literally
[02:28:45] have 140 ER without even trying
[02:28:50] I rolled this I had this this was plus
[02:28:51] 16 on stream I rolled this to 20 off
[02:28:53] Stream So the last roll was uh crit rate
[02:28:56] it used to have six crit rate so
[02:28:58] actually pretty
[02:29:02] good but I have oh my God that's too
[02:29:05] much 65 plus 36 wait what the [ __ ] oops
[02:29:11] sorry I'm not
[02:29:14] on you know Z not be the brightest but
[02:29:17] we love them okay like like say what
[02:29:20] okay uh where's
[02:29:22] Mali defense man if only she scaled on
[02:29:26] defense my build would be so much
[02:29:31] better this is how you know I'm not a
[02:29:34] leaker cuz I assumed she would scale on
[02:29:36] defense like when I got dude when I got
[02:29:39] this S I was like yes
[02:29:45] Navia okay
[02:29:48] um
[02:29:51] Suk sure
[02:29:54] Bud sure
[02:30:06] pal oh that's so nice that we can
[02:30:15] Auto
[02:30:19] do I have a geog goblet on set if I
[02:30:24] do oh
[02:30:27] whoa
[02:30:38] yeah oh yeah there's this now too look
[02:30:41] look this okay low key this is a lot
[02:30:43] cleaner I don't like that it's full
[02:30:44] screen but it's a lot cleaner so
[02:30:51] yeah let me filter by
[02:30:56] J she needs Em
[02:31:00] Right no no she doesn't um she doesn't
[02:31:04] want em because the so Gio is think of
[02:31:07] Gio as uh White physical it's okay to
[02:31:10] ask questions chat think of think of Gio
[02:31:13] as yellow physical okay Gio is physical
[02:31:16] but colored yellow there aren't any
[02:31:18] reactions that are happening the only
[02:31:20] thing Elemental Mastery does for Gio is
[02:31:22] increase the strength of your
[02:31:25] crystallized shield now you might be
[02:31:27] like oh that's cool no it doesn't do
[02:31:30] anything uh especially because genion
[02:31:32] impact has a really cool mechanic where
[02:31:34] if you have two Shields guess what they
[02:31:36] both [ __ ] break they both take damage
[02:31:38] at the same time they don't they don't
[02:31:39] do [ __ ] so let's say you're playing J Le
[02:31:41] I will have order Shield do then you
[02:31:44] pick up a crystallized Shield double
[02:31:45] shield do you get hit by something it
[02:31:48] [ __ ] breaks the inner small Shield
[02:31:50] before it breaks the big Shield by
[02:31:52] hitting both at the same time it doesn't
[02:31:53] like stack so yeah Em's useless I didn't
[02:31:56] know yeah I mean all good that's what
[02:31:58] I'm here for dude I this is my only J
[02:32:01] man I've been paying bills to you every
[02:32:04] month for a year now that's crazy love
[02:32:07] you of the Year hopefully I can get back
[02:32:09] into genin again soon and see you next
[02:32:12] year twitch con and take a cute picture
[02:32:14] yeah hello sh
[02:32:17] sure
[02:32:19] copia uh bro I don't have okay here's
[02:32:22] the problem I don't have a geog goblet
[02:32:24] that doesn't suck and I don't have an
[02:32:25] attack sand and you like dude how do you
[02:32:27] not have an attack Sand Dude I don't I
[02:32:28] don't what do you want me to do like I
[02:32:30] don't it's it's it's I
[02:32:36] don't if I have an attack one with crit
[02:32:38] damage I'll level it okay I
[02:32:40] do okay chat chat this is our last hope
[02:32:44] if this gets a 18 crit damage I'll use
[02:32:47] it oh my God oh my
[02:33:03] God someone said
[02:33:15] usable
[02:33:18] okay Real Talk Chat real talk I'm not
[02:33:20] even coping right now I'm being honest
[02:33:22] if this gets crit damage it could be
[02:33:25] usable cuz the only stats
[02:33:45] we
[02:33:49] use finina attack goblet cope I mean I
[02:33:52] was thinking that but it's like you
[02:33:56] still you you get a lot of I'm playing
[02:33:58] Bennett and you also get attack from her
[02:34:00] passive so I don't think it's I don't
[02:34:03] think it's the
[02:34:06] play we also have no blast and
[02:34:10] MTH it might be closer than I think
[02:34:13] though
[02:34:15] but
[02:34:21] but yeah Bennett is Bennett give her
[02:34:23] two-piece yeah but Mar is literally like
[02:34:27] I mean honestly this isn't that bad chat
[02:34:29] right this isn't that bad dude it's not
[02:34:32] that
[02:34:37] bad dude don't even type copium it's not
[02:34:41] that bad do that have a crit
[02:34:45] damage
[02:34:47] why is my leg on the wall I'm sorry uh
[02:34:49] that's crit rate that's attack that's
[02:34:51] crit damage but has no sub stats because
[02:34:52] we don't need crit rate this one is
[02:34:54] lowkey our best even though it gives us
[02:34:56] nothing um but see something that's
[02:34:58] really cool about about about about
[02:35:01] about about a gearing stream is that you
[02:35:02] can actually level pieces so watch this
[02:35:04] watch this if you let me cook I oh my
[02:35:08] God we oh I forgot we got we got the
[02:35:11] level wait we actually got [ __ ] to level
[02:35:13] chat hold your [ __ ] horses chat hold
[02:35:17] your
[02:35:19] horses first of

[02:36:01] damage decent rolls decent
[02:36:05] rolls please don't let me down this is
[02:36:07] the new artifact overlay maybe this is
[02:36:09] our overlay personally I don't like it
[02:36:11] because it's less hype but maybe it'll
[02:36:13] bring us good rolls that's one good roll
[02:36:16] that's one good
[02:36:19] roll that's Elemental Mastery which
[02:36:22] isn't
[02:36:23] useless but it's not really useful
[02:36:26] either we're going to put two plus
[02:36:28] eights in here I'm going to close my
[02:36:30] eyes when I open them I better see an
[02:36:31] arrow next to crit damage or
[02:36:34] crate thank you good artifact maybe you
[02:36:37] live to see another
[02:36:42] day is it a waste to put a plus 20

[02:36:53] appreciate
[02:36:58] that are
[02:37:00] you this is a prank there must be a
[02:37:02] camera somewhere this could be good for

[02:37:05] finina um but uh this is uh I mean it's
[02:37:12] not bad I don't want people to think

[02:37:27] good it's just not for our Navia it's
[02:37:30] it's good for um it's good yeah it's
[02:37:33] good for dude Mari sh Hunter could be
[02:37:34] used on literally any character with
[02:37:36] finina so if that character needs em for
[02:37:39] example dillick for example Hut for
[02:37:41] example someone else it's fine pretty
[02:37:44] like good cuz it was a force then it
[02:37:46] rolled good so it's actually pretty good

[02:41:12] troop was better am I wrong okay I know
[02:41:14] it's 53 plus plus 36 crit rate so we're
[02:41:17] basically 100 crit rate I know but like

[03:23:05] actually don't disagree like sack's good
[03:23:07] but like I I wouldn't really play it in
[03:23:09] one even without accounting for the
[03:23:11] you're saving it's about as much fing
[03:23:15] damage well because the thing because
[03:23:17] it's like it gives you ER and then it
[03:23:19] gives you ER on the effect and then I
[03:23:21] don't know but the extra skill cast yeah
[03:23:22] but like even without it it's a good
[03:23:24] option well yeah well no well yes cuz
[03:23:27] it's another skill cast but
[03:23:30] also I mean yeah but it's like you're
[03:23:32] losing you're losing how much damage
[03:23:37] percent also are you going to
[03:23:39] crystallize enough for three skills in a
[03:23:40] row if you're the s solo Geo character
[03:23:43] yes really you only need you only need
[03:23:45] like yeah you need three well no also
[03:23:48] your burst gives you Stacks your e
[03:23:52] itself gives you one crystallize because
[03:23:54] it's a [ __ ] Geo attack so you just
[03:23:57] need one more crystallize bat chesting
[03:24:00] from either an attack or your birth or
[03:24:03] [ __ ] anything you know it's hard not
[03:24:06] to get three yeah but you're
[03:24:09] coping why dude okay you're saying if in
[03:24:14] a team with zero ER requirements you go
[03:24:16] an ER weapon yeah okay I mean
[03:24:20] sure like sure but I wouldn't go that
[03:24:23] over a serpent unless you're like I
[03:24:26] don't know I mean you might not have a
[03:24:31] serpent has it but also no team has zero
[03:24:34] ER requirement well yeah if you're
[03:24:36] running another GE with fa you need
[03:24:38] like 125 Plus not I mean no but it could
[03:24:44] be and that's what the stat gives you
[03:24:47] from s great sword in yeah but the
[03:24:49] effect also gives you three particles
[03:24:51] right or four yeah but even if it didn't
[03:24:53] it's just the fact that you're getting
[03:24:55] the skill damage is better than almost
[03:24:58] every other effect from any other weapon
[03:25:00] in the
[03:25:01] game
[03:25:05] sure I mean like I it's not worth
[03:25:08] disagreeing right now but like sure like
[03:25:10] I think it's good I don't think it's as
[03:25:11] good as you think but I could be wrong
[03:25:13] cuz I am Fields crafting and you are
[03:25:15] Fields crafting unless it was math then
[03:25:17] I I can't talk it's both it was math and
[03:25:19] then it was Fields crafted to be as good
[03:25:21] as the math
[03:25:26] tone I mean
[03:25:31] sure
[03:25:33] anyways uh her new set is such a [ __ ]
[03:25:35] resin like
[03:25:38] void her new set feels so bad to farm
[03:25:41] yeah don't Farm it with finina yeah I'm
[03:25:45] just going to Golden her I think

[03:41:23] spawn like at the edge and like doing
[03:41:26] yeah they're
[03:41:28] weird I've done this Abyss so many times
[03:41:30] I hit
[03:41:32] it really now how many times at least
[03:41:39] two
[03:41:41] I think that's more than
[03:41:46] me the tides
[03:41:51] becking said nice Hydro Bro bucko nevet
[03:41:54] has zero Hydro out from our field and it
[03:41:57] was a [ __ ] pyro Abyss Mage then you
[03:41:59] swirl you forcefully swirl the Pyro and
[03:42:01] it doesn't matter cuz they die in like 2
[03:42:03] seconds and it's more of a shield check
[03:42:05] than a damage check why does the
[03:42:06] hydro nice team building solo Hydro
[03:42:10] that with a dendro unit with it's
[03:42:13] literally
[03:42:16] fine okay okay okay okay ready ready
[03:42:18] ready you can windy
[03:42:21] plant oh it's this [ __ ] I
[03:42:27] forgot I forgot to
[03:42:35] burst fine I time y I'm actually getting
[03:42:37] the timing right
[03:42:38] though you don't understand how many
[03:42:42] times I've said those exact words with
[03:42:45] that exact same intonation today like
[03:42:49] you actually don't
[03:42:53] understand dude what type of [ __ ]
[03:42:55] character bursts before Bennett I know
[03:42:59] and finina I
[03:43:05] know Sanctified my last two brain cells
[03:43:12] wait nevet can actually follow overload
[03:43:14] maybe nevet overloads the
[03:43:17] meta
[03:43:20] um sure buddy dude cuz if you overload
[03:43:23] the character into Narnia you can
[03:43:25] literally follow it with your [ __ ]
[03:43:26] Hydro
[03:43:28] beam yeah and the upside to that is you
[03:43:31] can follow them and you get to play
[03:43:34] powerful overload carries like Yen oh
[03:43:38] wait how are you doing that
[03:43:41] with you get to play powerful overload
[03:43:44] off fielders like true wait actually we
[03:43:49] might have cooked the
[03:43:52] team or
[03:43:54] de K wait what if overload saves
[03:43:59] de de's already been saved by hyper

[03:51:10] Shang Ling isn't a surprising best team

[03:51:14] is better than I thought which is cool I
[03:51:16] mean I knew it' be good in this team but
[03:51:18] I I guess I should try it in the double
[03:51:20] GE Al I don't really see the point but I

[03:56:22] called I forgot to burst that's only
[03:56:24] applicable for one
[03:56:27] team no you should do this in every one
[03:56:29] of her
[03:56:33] [Applause]
[03:56:34] teams guide maker by the
[03:56:37] way
[03:56:41] uh I mean you can but not always cuz
[03:56:44] sometimes you have like spare bit up
[03:56:45] time
[03:56:49] no like you'd rather bet at all I mean I
[03:56:52] guess it doesn't you rather you'd rather
[03:56:54] yeah you'd rather have the crystalizes I
[03:57:00] guess we'll never be the same I mean you
[03:57:03] could do I
[03:57:07] think
[03:57:09] wait wouldn't you want to okay wouldn't
[03:57:11] you want to like finina e q jangly e
[03:57:15] then Navia q and then Bennett or benett
[03:57:17] first like you should have time to do
[03:57:19] that what's the upside
[03:57:22] though I mean you might as well get your
[03:57:23] [ __ ] fan I me you could finina then
[03:57:25] Bennett and then you get well you get
[03:57:27] more up time of your burst with Bennett
[03:57:29] that's basically
[03:57:31] it and you not really I mean yeah cuz
[03:57:35] like your burst is kind of still going
[03:57:37] at the end you know
[03:57:39] I mean
[03:57:41] yeah your burst damage doesn't really
[03:57:43] matter well it's okay well then what's
[03:57:46] the
[03:57:48] upside yeah I mean it it'll I mean it
[03:57:50] only lasts for 12 honestly the main
[03:57:53] upside is you don't forget to bur yeah
[03:57:56] that is that is the biggest upside of of
[03:57:59] of
[03:58:00] not
[03:58:01] syncopating the
[03:58:07] burst
[03:58:18] nav no's

[04:33:52] [ __ ] well I don't want bro
[04:33:55] chill bro chill I don't want to do this
[04:33:57] much for
[04:34:03] million it just Auto
[04:34:05] it okay let's get out of here before
[04:34:07] things get dangerous let's get out of
[04:34:09] here before things get
[04:34:11] dangerous why the [ __ ]
[04:34:18] ayss trying to flick onto
[04:34:22] it I got
[04:34:29] it how's not yeah she's pretty
[04:34:32] good she's really good I like her she's
[04:34:35] not like broken but like she's good
[04:34:37] really good I
[04:34:39] think like DPS wise I like her only
[04:34:42] problem is uh Geo but she's kind of like
[04:34:45] she I think she distances herself from
[04:34:47] the Geo element well enough to where
[04:34:49] she's good if that makes sense she's not
[04:34:52] like oh my God play me with eight GEOS
[04:34:55] it's like you can play her with like
[04:34:56] zero or one other
[04:34:58] GEOS one of the good ones hey Queen She
[04:35:02] riing on J Le no if anything she's more
[04:35:04] riing on Bennett
[04:35:05] but I don't think I'm going to say that
[04:35:07] when talking about our teams because
[04:35:09] it's not really true it's just there's
[04:35:10] not many healers that Geo teams like
[04:35:13] other than Bennett That's it there might
[04:35:14] be some in the future except well you
[04:35:17] can play Noel but like you'd have to
[04:35:18] Noel
[04:35:29] finina
[04:35:32] Suk what if we play a team with no
[04:35:35] energy like no
[04:35:39] reactions lowkey cryo but you can cryo
[04:35:42] swirl and Crow crystalize actually that
[04:35:45] was the worst take of all time wait is
[04:35:46] there there H what should the last
[04:35:48] character
[04:35:54] be double
[04:36:00] dendro okay let's do a clear um we'll
[04:36:02] play Navia again with uh
[04:36:06] [Music]
[04:36:12] maybe hyper I don't like her inro
[04:36:30] teams what about
[04:36:33] this oh Sunfire I forgot about that wait
[04:36:36] but my Jean's not on
[04:36:43] em would this even
[04:36:46] work I mean it probably would but why
[04:36:49] would you play Navia I
[04:36:51] mean why not I
[04:36:54] guess this honestly might work yeah it
[04:36:57] actually might
[04:37:04] work you heard about offset na'vi attack
[04:37:06] wait offset plays gin yo what the
[04:37:12] [ __ ] no what is
[04:37:23] that where's
[04:37:28] Jean thought you was not 90 should be
[04:37:33] here Chad be honest did I ruin this Jean
[04:37:35] skin for you
[04:37:49] guys you enhanced it thanks that was my
[04:37:53] true supporters right
[04:38:03] there
[04:38:24] only beneficial really I mean okay yeah
[04:38:27] that's feels like the standard team
[04:38:31] however like that I feel like that's her
[04:38:33] best team no that's not true I I feel
[04:38:35] like that's the standard team that you
[04:38:36] would default to but is it actually
[04:38:38] better than Bennett
[04:38:41] finina and
[04:38:46] maybe I going try
[04:39:03] it
[04:39:12] can you play no well dude she's level
[04:39:26] 40 I can't find anyone Navia her with
[04:39:29] Lila furina and Charlotte cuz Charlotte
[04:39:31] has so much prry app and Lila has her
[04:39:33] burst and shield
[04:39:36] h no
[04:39:38] but you can and that's

[04:41:35] on sack this team should be on sack
[04:41:37] whatever uh well
[04:41:41] as I have bad feelings about this in
[04:41:43] single Target but whatever I actually
[04:41:46] don't know why I brought the second half
[04:41:47] but it's

[04:42:58] to do I
[04:43:03] guess
[04:43:05] how much ER is on your Navia uh my my
[04:43:07] finina is on five which is why but she

[04:55:40] wait what the [ __ ] is this
[04:55:47] team okay do you want to hear say fire
[04:55:49] instead of
[04:56:02] attack
[04:56:06] [Music]
[04:56:07] hang on I think that's the wrong domain
[04:56:08] now it's just for
[04:56:09] testing it's just for testing
[04:56:13] purposes it's just for testing
[04:56:32] purposes
[04:56:38] like no Stacks
[04:56:44] there boken the boken I could have reong
[04:56:48] the shielded but [ __ ]
[04:56:51] you thought it was American
[04:57:02] Sniper
[04:57:16] wait dude how do I need so much
[04:57:21] ER I mean fish is none
[04:57:28] but if you sprint I get Navia why are
[04:57:31] you what does that even mean
[04:57:43] cuz you need to burst on Fishel here
[04:57:46] like you want to be able to burst on her
[04:57:47] every
[04:57:48] two not every time which shouldn't be
[04:57:51] hard you only need a little bit cuz like
[04:57:53] first time you burst and then second
[04:57:54] time you
[04:57:55] e so it shouldn't be
[04:57:59] hard just need a little bit of Y
[04:58:24] yeah like that works and then we just
[04:58:26] reset that and that and then that and
[04:58:29] then that
[04:58:31] yeah yeah
[04:58:33] yeah
[04:58:35] y Yahoo
[04:58:41] sorry okay let me go to the
[04:59:02] jish
[04:59:06] I do have
[04:59:23] to bro stop spamming the same question
[04:59:27] now I don't want to answer
[04:59:30] it that's Gees I'm not trying to kill it
[04:59:32] and in
[04:59:39] fact actually this looks like a real
[04:59:41] weapon let me take it
[05:00:01] off
[05:00:06] we are at the ZF
[05:00:10] spot if I don't have enough ER I will
[05:00:13] scream I mean he's probably going to
[05:00:15] [ __ ] whack my pillar and break it uh
[05:00:17] probably benr
[05:00:21] right although O's off time is uh not
[05:00:31] ideal
[05:00:33] yeah and then it's up so we probably J
[05:00:35] Le and then benett but if we don't get
[05:00:36] the second e you need like a million ER
[05:00:38] feel
[05:00:40] like me
[05:00:50] maybe you're just yeah we're using the
[05:00:52] level one weapon
[05:01:01] yeah
[05:01:15] [Music]
[05:01:22] wow yeah that actually works and then
[05:01:24] our cool Downs are back we just need a
[05:01:26] bit more ear this this works but you
[05:01:27] need way more like a lot
[05:01:31] more I don't think this matters because
[05:01:35] either way in the video I'm going to be
[05:01:36] recommending this team so I don't think
[05:01:37] it matters if you do a fast or a long
[05:01:40] rotation but if you do a short one you
[05:01:42] need more ER that's all and it's
[05:01:45] probably better because your cool Downs
[05:01:47] line
[05:01:48] up sack yeah I mean yeah I mean yeah
[05:01:52] unironically yeah no but sack makes your
[05:01:54] rotation longer so it would it would
[05:01:56] change no no are you [ __ ] me right
[05:02:00] side upside
[05:02:01] downside
[05:02:19] this is why you don't get new Chatters
[05:02:21] what does that even
[05:02:22] mean new Chatters love me right
[05:02:29] guys
[05:02:30] [Music]
[05:02:31] Yahoo

[05:02:47] sorry
[05:02:54] sorry
[05:03:01] sorry
[05:03:07] what
[05:03:10] I please no no please please don't make
[05:03:14] me do this please don't please I do not
[05:03:16] want to go f vet
[05:03:18] please please don't make me go F
[05:03:31] Bennett
[05:03:38] fire
[05:03:56] sorry I mean this works we just don't
[05:03:58] have our burst but it would basically be
[05:04:00] that and
[05:04:01] then
[05:04:07] yeah I
[05:04:13] mean
[05:04:21] yeah isn't fa benett good don't talk to
[05:04:23] me it's not bad it's actually it's
[05:04:25] sometimes as good but I just hate it I
[05:04:28] despise it that doesn't make it bad I
[05:04:30] just it goes against my morals
[05:04:34] it goes against everything I stand
[05:04:42] for where the
[05:05:01] [ __ ]
[05:05:03] okay let's
[05:05:17] go wait where the [ __ ] did I I didn't
[05:05:20] crit [ __ ] you I didn't crit
[05:05:24] again life boms like a FL far
[05:05:31] away
[05:05:38] why not try on chicken because the
[05:05:39] damage doesn't really matter I'm just
[05:05:41] making sure it works but like I pretty I
[05:05:43] pretty much confirmed it now I don't
[05:05:44] know why I'm doing
[05:06:01] this
[05:06:12] okay let me save this just in case I
[05:06:13] need
[05:06:26] it wait
[05:06:28] [Music]
[05:06:31] so
[05:06:45] what happens if you put another pyro
[05:06:46] character instead of fishal hey hey I
[05:06:50] like what you're
[05:06:56] cooking and share what I'm talking about
[05:06:58] I mean I think it's pretty
[05:07:00] self-explanatory right
[05:07:02] you just do three like you do whatever
[05:07:05] your normal combo is which I assume is
[05:07:06] three and then
[05:07:08] two and you just do it twice and then
[05:07:10] you go jly benit ficial Navia
[05:07:12] probably you could I still think Navia
[05:07:15] burst at the start might make
[05:07:18] sense but I
[05:07:24] yeah how much does dashing after your
[05:07:27] eatter does that matter like I know Dash
[05:07:30] cancelling like basically everything's
[05:07:31] faster
[05:07:40] but guide maker yeah but if I do every
[05:07:42] team's rotation it takes like it'll make
[05:07:45] the video like 50 minutes which is why
[05:07:47] it's not worth it especially for a day
[05:07:48] one video which is why I usually do one
[05:07:50] example rotation if the character is
[05:07:52] complicated Navia is kind of in the
[05:07:54] Middle where it's kind of like you kind
[05:07:57] of can just do almost any normal attack
[05:07:59] combo provided it's 4 seconds like I
[05:08:01] like I like
[05:08:03] the uh the one like that is good because
[05:08:06] it's like [ __ ] 50 hits like that it's
[05:08:08] kind of like with Jang Lee you do like
[05:08:10] you kick and then you dash
[05:08:12] it you can Dash can very
[05:08:17] easy which is
[05:08:21] three but
[05:08:30] yeah okay this chatter is so
[05:08:35] annoying it has to be a
[05:08:37] timeout I'm
[05:08:41] sorry yeah I
[05:09:01] agree
[05:09:08] okay I mean I think we did what we have
[05:09:09] to
[05:09:11] do um the only things I need to probably
[05:09:15] add are I pretty much covered every team
[05:09:18] that's good in terms of like not all of
[05:09:20] I mean there's like maybe some I want to
[05:09:23] test I mean don't the only one I didn't
[05:09:25] think of that I might add is Sunfire but
[05:09:28] I think in this team you would need
[05:09:31] sack
[05:09:35] uh and outside of that I
[05:09:56] think yeah there's some things I would
[05:10:00] add let me see
[05:10:31] this
[05:10:42] hey z x hello I saw you watching the kai
[05:10:47] stream you must be a big fan and play
[05:10:49] the game a ton
[05:10:55] right I okay I'm going to pretend I
[05:10:57] didn't read
[05:11:00] that can I used during combat okay how
[05:11:03] am I in combat with what good
[05:11:08] night thatle should I watch this okay we
[05:11:10] watch
[05:11:11] it what is
[05:11:22] this can I okay this is okay no
[05:11:25] discrimination towards PlayStation
[05:11:27] players but this is on
[05:11:29] Playstation no discrimination towards
[05:11:32] PlayStation players but this is on
[05:11:48] Playstation dude she has so much hit leg
[05:11:51] also is your Bennett C6 was that
[05:12:00] Pyro
[05:12:24] I mean
[05:12:30] yeah
[05:12:40] I mean
[05:12:42] yeah
[05:12:45] yeah you
[05:12:49] yeah yeah I'm pretty sure the standard
[05:12:51] rotation that team is 18 seconds and the
[05:12:52] only difference is you have time to I'm
[05:12:54] pretty sure you have time to Jong
[05:12:57] EQ
[05:12:59] um but like yeah
[05:13:02] yeah that's cool it's cool to know that
[05:13:04] a rotations are flexible I don't think
[05:13:06] I'll cover
[05:13:08] like I don't think it's worth for me
[05:13:11] to cover a 16 18 and 20 and technically
[05:13:17] uh 6times 3
[05:13:20] 24 uh wait what the [ __ ] am I saying 9 *
[05:13:22] 3 27 but that one's kind of bad
[05:13:26] but
[05:13:28] yeah sorry I don't know why I said
[05:13:30] 6times three
[05:13:35] but I'll figure it
[05:13:37] out did you see you're going to pull for
[05:13:39] the axe I definitely will and we got
[05:13:40] lost prayer when we tried
[05:13:45] today what the [ __ ] I'm going to drown
[05:13:49] yo yo give me the
[05:13:51] chest give me the
[05:13:58] chest let me go for now
[05:14:03] I miss
[05:14:06] finina yeah I mean I think the most
[05:14:08] applicable rotation is the same one but
[05:14:09] jly Q just cuz it's more comfy and you
[05:14:12] actually get to use it for once and most
[05:14:14] people are going to have a bit of
[05:14:15] downtime on Navia instead of like having
[05:14:16] to rush it all but I do think oh
[05:14:18] achievement I think that's good to
[05:14:30] know
[05:14:38] animation is just nice dude I've learned
[05:14:40] to hate it cuz it takes so long it
[05:14:41] stresses me out I feel the abyss timer
[05:14:43] ticking but yeah it's cool anyways we
[05:14:46] got our chest
[05:14:52] easy like the city can't hold
[05:15:00] us but yeah I mean the the basics are
[05:15:03] that you can swap in and out of her kind
[05:15:05] of whenever you can burst at the start
[05:15:06] of your rotation too especially in some
[05:15:08] teams that want the solo Geo or that
[05:15:10] solo Geo to crystallize more and you
[05:15:12] typically you just normal attack for 4
[05:15:15] seconds usually I assume it's normal
[05:15:17] three times and then Dash and then
[05:15:18] however many you could do after which I
[05:15:20] think is two and then outside of that
[05:15:22] it's just [ __ ] short hold your e and
[05:15:25] don't suck but it's pretty flexible like
[05:15:27] you can you can also save the second e
[05:15:30] like you can like e once normal swap the
[05:15:32] jly burst swap back
[05:15:45] normal Talent priority skill and then if
[05:15:48] you're on field this if you're not on
[05:15:49] field this but
[05:15:57] skill can you talk about how good the
[05:15:58] shotgun feels yeah it's really
[05:15:59] satisfying it's very satisfying I really
[05:16:01] like Navia sorry I'm super tired and I'm
[05:16:03] thinking about some stuff that I'm going
[05:16:05] to record so I'm a bit dud but um yeah I
[05:16:09] think most of it's pretty much
[05:16:15] done appreciate it though s
[05:16:20] um
[05:16:30] yeah
[05:16:33] do talk andus of Geo yes for 4 seconds I
[05:16:36] wasn't sure if it was 4 seconds or 4
[05:16:37] seconds plus hit lag but it's just 4
[05:16:39] seconds so
[05:16:54] yeah all right sorry I'm Deadshot next
[05:16:56] stream will be a bit more energetic I'll
[05:16:57] be live in probably a day or two uh I'm
[05:16:59] just going to I have to end so that I
[05:17:01] can work on the Navia video I think I
[05:17:03] didn't want to add a full combo section
[05:17:05] because I think it varies extremely
[05:17:06] heavily but I might I might add it I
[05:17:08] might call it Advanced tips or something
[05:17:10] instead of Combos and what I'll do is
[05:17:12] just address not address but just
[05:17:15] mention burst at the start well you
[05:17:17] might drawing the pillar before the
[05:17:18] burst that depends but burst at the
[05:17:20] start if you're solo Geo if you're not
[05:17:21] near the start and what normal attack
[05:17:23] combos are optimal but the thing is
[05:17:25] there like eight different normal attack
[05:17:26] strings that are fine play some hongar
[05:17:29] ra yeah it's it's like more variable
[05:17:32] than most characters which is why I
[05:17:34] don't want to go in too much detail but
[05:17:36] I'll probably mention the key points and
[05:17:38] then from there you could craft what
[05:17:39] works with your team I do think sack
[05:17:41] great swword with solo Geo is really
[05:17:43] good though but that is as a Jeff take
[05:17:46] so shout out to
[05:17:54] him I am not clicking that
[05:18:00] link
