[00:22:42] Z's tall so please follow this one
[00:22:44] instead uh listen first of all we are
[00:22:48] tall that is true I launched this
[00:22:50] yesterday this could also be read as zxy
[00:22:53] stall or as Zio I stall so that's cool
[00:22:57] um but anyways it is z is tall that's
[00:23:00] that's what it is it's not it's not
[00:23:02] stalling it's not stalling but I can't
[00:23:05] use the name that I had it'll probably
[00:23:07] be changed in like a month when I get it
[00:23:09] but for now it is Zio's tall not Z not
[00:23:13] not Zio iall that's not how you should
[00:23:16] read it so so I will link it uh uh if
[00:23:19] you want content there there will be
[00:23:21] some exclusive content uh unfortunately

[01:21:52] friend who plays like every Mo
[01:21:54] MMO it is like it is like league but
[01:21:59] more toxic oh wait it's a MOA never mind
[01:22:00] I don't know what you're talking about I
[01:22:01] think of something else it's not a MOA
[01:22:03] it's it's it's MOA is but it's not a
[01:22:07] MOA okay I I don't know what that is it
[01:22:10] has the same angle but it's a MMO oh you
[01:22:14] know my brother's addicted to mobile
[01:22:17] Legends I I have never played mobile
[01:22:19] Legends or seen mobile Legends gameplay
[01:22:22] in my life life you keep that my entire
[01:22:25] life I I I swear to God people talk
[01:22:27] about it all the time I have never
[01:22:30] played that game seen that game in my
[01:22:33] entire
[01:22:37] life uh mean either no I actually
[01:22:39] haven't either but well it looks like
[01:22:41] it's basically just like a league ripoff
[01:22:42] but I don't
[01:22:44] know it's it's league if you don't have
[01:22:47] a PC is what I well he's a Casual Gamer

[01:32:16] up you do it for a a reward an an
[01:32:18] achievement but you have to do it for

[01:32:43] like so much [ __ ] I have millions of
[01:32:45] hours into
[01:32:48] RuneScape I know I know I would cuz cuz

[01:33:00] pretty good
[01:33:01] okay uh okay this one might not be that
[01:33:04] good but it's still it's still I don't I
[01:33:05] don't know this this this is the next
[01:33:06] question who do you ship sh with me next
[01:33:11] question what do you
[01:33:15] mean I don't I'm not a big shipper like
[01:33:17] I don't care like you know I'm not going
[01:33:19] to like Yak your yam like who you like
[01:33:21] ship what you ship I don't give a [ __ ] I
[01:33:23] don't care do it don't do it but like me
[01:33:25] and Shia were cool I like
[01:33:28] Shia you like Shia that much are you
[01:33:31] dude are you
[01:33:33] trolling look at him okay what if he
[01:33:37] look at him like all all three feet like
[01:33:41] what
[01:33:45] what Shia dude dude dude Shia he's like
[01:33:50] what is Shia for the the blind he is
[01:33:52] vision for the deaf he is hearing for
[01:33:54] the hungry he is food for the Thirsty he
[01:33:56] is
[01:33:59] water the ants he is them you know he is
[01:34:03] what what
[01:34:08] okay oh did you mean 3 feet cuz he was
[01:34:11] short I thought you were like
[01:34:12] referencing like the [ __ ] pole
[01:34:15] arm no no no no no no he's not short by
[01:34:17] the way short like are you he sh's an
[01:34:20] adeptus meaning he can choose any
[01:34:21] physical form he wants because he's not
[01:34:23] just like a human so he could choose his
[01:34:24] physical form because of this he could
[01:34:25] choose to be tall or short or anything
[01:34:27] which means he has any height every
[01:34:29] height and all the heights but there are
[01:34:31] two things first of all he only appears
[01:34:32] short if you are zero friendship don't
[01:34:34] play him no constellations he gets
[01:34:35] taller as you play him and with
[01:34:36] friendship second of all even if you
[01:34:38] perceive him as short it would be a
[01:34:39] message to be like hey size isn't
[01:34:41] everything right it's not just the end
[01:34:43] all Beall but furthermore that is just a
[01:34:46] trap for people like a bait for people
[01:34:47] who don't actually play sh to thinky
[01:34:49] sword but when you do play them and you
[01:34:50] use them and you own them and you level
[01:34:52] him up he gets taller and then you
[01:34:54] actually can understand that Shia isn't
[01:34:56] in
[01:34:57] fact short and he not Everything Is Not
[01:35:00] What It Seems Wizards of Waverly Place
[01:35:02] reference where are we going
[01:35:04] next the worm all right wait which wor
[01:35:07] there's like 15 so
[01:35:09] dark the mechanical one okay wait can I
[01:35:12] can I ask you something yeah do you like
[01:35:18] EO Define light I mean like what do you
[01:35:21] think about it like you know
[01:35:23] like I don't know like what you think
[01:35:25] forms of like you know like like like to
[01:35:29] what degree like do I like him enough to
[01:35:31] let him shove his like uh his um his uh
[01:35:34] no that's not what I was
[01:35:36] asking like do you like like okay [ __ ] I
[01:35:39] was just going to ask I was going to ask
[01:35:41] if if he was worth like the Geo wolf
[01:35:43] Lord coming in the abyss every time he's
[01:35:44] there or if you would rather never have
[01:35:46] EO but never have the GE wol
[01:35:49] for but you don't haveo to
[01:35:52] no no oh my God you to fight the Geo
[01:35:54] wolf no but there's different Geo
[01:35:57] characters okay that's not what I'm
[01:35:59] first of all where the [ __ ] are you you
[01:36:01] said the worm there's like 15 worms are
[01:36:03] you in the
[01:36:03] chasm wait can you not find oh you're in
[01:36:06] the chmm okay yes Chasm okay okay but

[01:36:30] your shout for like five minutes
[01:36:32] straight that's fine right yeah the
[01:36:33] point I'm making is that it's I hate
[01:36:35] that boss and I hope it never ever makes
[01:36:38] it to the abyss or to my psych ever
[01:36:41] again I don't think it's that bad I

[01:36:45] negative uh negative bias on uh on a
[01:36:48] genit impa not that bad the GE wol for
[01:36:51] could literally if it goes to the
[01:36:53] cafeteria and sits down no one is

[01:50:55] Razer in Japanese sounds so
[01:50:57] sick I have never heard of dude
[01:51:00] literally listen in English no
[01:51:01] disrespect you know great voice acting
[01:51:02] but in English he's like I'm razor and
[01:51:05] then in Japanese he sounds like a
[01:51:06] [ __ ]
[01:51:08] gigachad maybe I should play in
[01:51:11] Japanese you play in Japanese you play
[01:51:13] in uh English right uh I used to play
[01:51:14] Japanese but on stream I play English so
[01:51:16] that when I say voice lines people don't
[01:51:17] think I'm crazy crazy I was crazy once
[01:51:21] oh you were crazy once just once yeah y
[01:51:25] Miko made me change to English cuz she's
[01:51:26] like right here right now emerge and
[01:51:28] then Shen is like Skyward huh
[01:51:32] scatter just like those two characters
[01:51:34] specifically yeah cuz they use their
[01:51:36] skill three times each time they're on
[01:51:37] field y uses it six
[01:51:39] times meanwhile Fel just has to cast her
[01:51:41] e to sumon Oz
[01:51:45] anyways okay wait wait wait wait we got
[01:51:47] we got to focus up on this one we cannot
[01:51:49] have the we do not want to break the
[01:51:50] shield twice go go go go go disappear my
[01:51:54] physical
[01:51:55] goet oh this thing's dead not even close
[01:51:58] let's go
[01:52:02] nice okay next question next
[01:52:04] question
[01:52:06] um okay this this is a real question
[01:52:10] from a real person why would it be from
[01:52:12] a fake person okay
[01:52:14] genuinely what units do you admit are
[01:52:17] better than
[01:52:18] Shia okay I'm very honest meta wise
[01:52:22] because I don't like to mislead people
[01:52:23] so like when I make a video or I'm
[01:52:25] talking about like hey should I pull for
[01:52:26] sh a lot of times I'm like you know like
[01:52:27] you can get nevet you get Alam like
[01:52:29] there's a lot of better options meta
[01:52:30] wise until this patch now still nevet is
[01:52:33] better but like this patch if you have
[01:52:35] shenyun and C far on in finina is
[01:52:36] actually pretty meta so it's like now a
[01:52:38] lot of things change but it also depends
[01:52:39] on your account cuz he's expensive so
[01:52:41] like if you have no other supports
[01:52:42] there's a lot of DPSS that can be better
[01:52:44] for cheaper but if you have like you
[01:52:46] pulled on the shun Banner you have fariz
[01:52:47] on C6 and then either B Bennett or fre
[01:52:49] Ena right then Shia's actually pretty
[01:52:51] meta right now but it's you know I'm
[01:52:54] more I recommend support characters to
[01:52:56] pull generally more than DPSS because
[01:52:58] you can use them on so many teams so
[01:53:00] many account like most accounts can fit
[01:53:02] a finina can fit a like whatever support
[01:53:05] right whereas if you already have two
[01:53:07] really good DPSS do you need to pull for
[01:53:08] sha do you need to pull for Hut do you
[01:53:10] need like depends right it depends on
[01:53:12] what you like uh but I think he's gotten
[01:53:14] a lot better and I think in his best
[01:53:15] team he's meta and his other teams he's
[01:53:17] okay okay yeah that's fair that's fair
[01:53:21] yeah I'm very careful with like gacha
[01:53:22] advice cuz I want to like make people
[01:53:24] feel like they need to pull on something
[01:53:25] like everyone when I started making G
[01:53:27] videos I feel like a lot of people no no
[01:53:28] shade but I feel like a lot of stuff
[01:53:30] that I saw was like you need this
[01:53:31] character so you need this character you
[01:53:33] need this character so it was like I
[01:53:35] don't want people to think or like you
[01:53:36] need C6 and so I was like yeah I like to
[01:53:38] Hype characters up but I don't want
[01:53:39] people to feel like they need a
[01:53:40] character so I try to be a little honest
[01:53:43] right yeah I try to mislead people all
[01:53:45] the time so they don't use the as me
[01:53:48] yeah
[01:53:51] like how how I say I say finina is bad
[01:53:53] all the time and people people genuinely
[01:53:55] believe it like they they they don't
[01:53:57] like
[01:53:58] they you'll get
[01:53:59] mad no they don't get mad I I oh they're
[01:54:03] not allowed to get mad they get banned
[01:54:04] oh
[01:54:06] okay I see so we run a
[01:54:10] dictatorship who the [ __ ] is that you
[01:54:12] it's not
[01:54:15] you I like the M K I think he's
[01:54:18] cooloring let an neemo res I forgot I'm
[01:54:21] going to die again oh does he actually
[01:54:24] actually I don't remember stay in stay
[01:54:25] in D stay in I'm pretty sure he does I
[01:54:29] know the we not has like 7
[01:54:31] million oh yeah I not you not we
[01:54:35] not
[01:54:37] true people genuinely think I'm crazy
[01:54:39] when I was fighting the wut in the abyss
[01:54:41] they genu I I I feel like I was
[01:54:43] genuinely going crazy cuz I was doing
[01:54:45] absolutely zero damage dude it is such a
[01:54:48] stupid piece of [ __ ] I'm sorry the WEA
[01:54:51] literally dances you can't even rotation
[01:54:53] properly God forbid you need to like
[01:54:55] stay on a character it dashes everywhere
[01:54:57] then you have to like pop the bubbles
[01:54:59] and if you don't you do no damage and if
[01:55:00] you do that whatever you popped it with
[01:55:03] the resistance is lowered so then you
[01:55:04] have to like pop off but if you don't
[01:55:07] GG and it stands back up in like two
[01:55:09] seconds yeah it does and has D res and
[01:55:11] like Animo res so the characters that
[01:55:13] you like are no longer characters that
[01:55:14] you
[01:55:15] like
[01:55:17] anyways oh yeah yeah I was like I was
[01:55:20] like using Alm was like I was doing zero
[01:55:22] damage to it like actually zero damage
[01:55:25] like genuinely like like I I think I saw
[01:55:28] three digits like actually three digits
[01:55:30] okay I said dendro and an emo but it's
[01:55:31] every res and especially anemo that is
[01:55:33] the correct uh not to be misleading but
[01:55:36] yes it has like Omega resistances and
[01:55:38] then when it's down it loses some but
[01:55:41] yeah but but my chest said to use I'll
[01:55:44] hate them yeah yeah it's fine it's it's
[01:55:46] so it's mostly an the only thing it
[01:55:48] actually has a special resist
[01:55:49] resistances to is Animo everything else
[01:55:51] it's high like equal like dendro isn't
[01:55:53] more it's not more resistant to dendro
[01:55:54] than cryo but it's still it still has
[01:55:58] resistances like it's just tanky
[01:56:00] basically but Animo is especially bad
[01:56:02] against
[01:56:03] it I see yeah I thought dendro too but
[01:56:06] that was just cuz it was green so I got
[01:56:09] baited I have to fact check myself
[01:56:12] sometimes I think green enemies are D
[01:56:13] resistant I have to I have to I have to
[01:56:16] you
[01:56:17] know like you think Shia's dead isn't
[01:56:20] all right yes yes sh looks lowkey a
[01:56:23] little Electro cuz he has like purple
[01:56:24] legs and [ __ ] like pants and like a
[01:56:27] skirt oh yeah

[02:01:51] four there's three other people in here
[02:01:53] you can okay all right
[02:01:57] yeah where am I going oh over
[02:02:02] here all right next question um let's
[02:02:06] [Music]
[02:02:10] see these are all kind of
[02:02:14] terrible okay wait okay this one's
[02:02:17] actually genuinely kind of good um um
[02:02:20] not good but like actually normal any
[02:02:23] tips for those who want to soon are are
[02:02:26] Shia
[02:02:28] me you want to like fix that question
[02:02:33] grammatically it's it's a wait I'm
[02:02:35] literally saying any tips for those who
[02:02:38] want to soon our shms I'm I'm literally
[02:02:41] reading it as is okay okay all good um
[02:02:45] uh the biggest tip I could give you is
[02:02:47] that Shia's only good Banner was last
[02:02:49] half and Shia wasn't on it it was
[02:02:50] shenyun and finina if you missed that
[02:02:52] tough luck no I'm just kidding I mean
[02:02:54] but yeah I mean you want farzon and
[02:02:57] every farzon Banner is like Scaro C5 you
[02:02:59] get by accident but now you can actually
[02:03:01] get shenyun who's like his best support
[02:03:02] as well as finina uh farzon but uh did I
[02:03:05] say finina instead of farzon I meant to
[02:03:06] say finina [ __ ] I meant never mind uh
[02:03:10] yeah pull on that Banner if it's not if
[02:03:11] you did that was I don't want to talk
[02:03:14] anymore okay okay fair enough fair
[02:03:16] enough so so basically if you don't have
[02:03:18] finina if you don't have no no you don't
[02:03:20] need finina you don't need finina but
[02:03:22] farzon and shun's
[02:03:24] banner finina [ __ ] finina [ __ ] character
[02:03:28] don't P for finina just Cloud retainer
[02:03:30] right wait don't one sec uh no so
[02:03:33] farizon was with Cloud retainer so you
[02:03:35] want both also the okay disable that
[02:03:37] emote thing that's like a sub emote I
[02:03:39] don't want to yink a sub emote I'm
[02:03:40] pretty sure but it's a cool emote
[02:03:42] anyways yeah so farizon was on a banner
[02:03:44] that wasn't Scara for like the first
[02:03:46] time so it's really good for
[02:03:47] sha um
[02:03:51] um do you need cak for okay let me
[02:03:55] explain this in an analogy I'm so glad
[02:03:57] you asked czo farizon so okay so the
[02:04:00] other day I was taking a shower real
[02:04:01] story literally this week okay well I
[02:04:03] take a shower like every day but I was
[02:04:04] saying this week I was taking a like
[02:04:05] earlier this week I was taking a shower
[02:04:06] and I was looking for my shampoo I was
[02:04:08] like trying to put shampoo but there's
[02:04:09] like none left so what I did was I took
[02:04:11] the cap off I filled some water in it I
[02:04:13] had to like shake it really hard to get
[02:04:15] like a little bit of shampoo and I got
[02:04:16] enough to wash my hair shake it you
[02:04:17] shaking sh that is what it feels like to
[02:04:20] have a c on it's still better than no
[02:04:22] shampoo you're going to wash your hair
[02:04:24] but it's going to be more annoying it's
[02:04:25] going to take longer it's going to be
[02:04:26] harder whereas if you have a C6 on
[02:04:28] that's like overflowing overloaded
[02:04:31] unlimited shampoo right it's it's like
[02:04:33] brushing your it's like okay you're
[02:04:35] driving a truck with 20 Wheels okay that
[02:04:38] is C6 far on c0 far on is like a truck
[02:04:41] but there's only one wheel and it's like
[02:04:43] barely a truck and it's like shaking and
[02:04:45] like it's better than no truck you don't
[02:04:47] want to walk to [ __ ] uh Texas but but
[02:04:50] you know I'd rather have a 28 wheeler
[02:04:53] than a one-wheeler you get me okay yeah
[02:04:58] yeah I have no idea what you just said
[02:05:00] but I'm just going I'm I'm just going to
[02:05:01] go with it I just c farone's not useless
[02:05:04] I just really hate it because C6 is like
[02:05:06] insanely uh uh better so so C so C6 or
[02:05:11] bus got it okay C6 or bus do not pull
[02:05:13] for Faron if you cannot get C6 well it
[02:05:18] [ __ ] character [ __ ] [ __ ] character c0 to
[02:05:20] 5 do not pull for it do not pull for
[02:05:24] it my c0 Faron used to use a hydro
[02:05:27] goblet because it had 25 ER on
[02:05:31] it 20 25 yeah just so I could get her
[02:05:34] burst back before [ __ ] genin 2 came
[02:05:37] out genin genin 2 yeah oh
[02:05:42] yeah you think there's going to be a g
[02:05:46] too sorry oh I was talking to
[02:05:50] you dude but I'm not dead I'm talking
[02:05:53] too yeah but I'm focused on
[02:05:56] talking sorry I'm not a streamer like
[02:05:58] you I don't talk a lot what the [ __ ]
[02:06:00] what the my God there's so much purple
[02:06:04] anyways
[02:06:05] um no I mean I feel like they're going
[02:06:08] to keep expending on get sh and then if
[02:06:09] ever it's like actually like downfall
[02:06:11] they'll just make
[02:06:12] something I don't think it'll be genin 2
[02:06:14] I think it'll be another game
[02:06:16] right like genin impact mobile version
[02:06:21] true genjin but on the
[02:06:24] switch okay yeah we're we're going to
[02:06:27] get
[02:06:28] that like just just we're going to get
[02:06:31] listen listen here's my theory when
[02:06:33] genjin impact switch comes out we're
[02:06:36] going to get the genip impact anime as
[02:06:39] like feel like anime is going to come
[02:06:41] out first I'm not even coping I'm
[02:06:42] excited for the anime
[02:06:44] though you're you genuinely wait you
[02:06:47] genuinely believe they're going to going
[02:06:48] to release an anime wait is this like a
[02:06:51] meme okay I know it's been like stalling
[02:06:53] but is it not with [ __ ] UFO table or

[02:08:36] you pick like 14 other characters okay
[02:08:37] if I pick one I pick Shia and it's not
[02:08:39] even close but there's a lot of other
[02:08:40] characters I really like too like I
[02:08:41] spend longer thinking about who I want
[02:08:42] to play than actually playing games a
[02:08:44] lot of the times like the only reason I
[02:08:45] kept playing OverWatch after the [ __ ]
[02:08:47] Dev said go [ __ ] yourself and stop

[02:16:12] any other suu's water meanwhile has a
[02:16:15] rich and complex flavor profile but it

[02:26:54] yeah will you whale on Dane
[02:26:57] Slave oh yeah what the [ __ ]
[02:26:59] absolutely I I usually see Z five star
[02:27:01] characters though my biggest regret
[02:27:03] sometimes is having c6s or like I only
[02:27:05] have C6 sh but like even C2 Ryden I
[02:27:07] activated and I hate it cuz now every
[02:27:08] time I use Ryden and like she would look
[02:27:11] good everyone's like oh it's cuz you
[02:27:12] have C2 it's cuz you same with Shia it's
[02:27:14] like Shia's C6 all the constellations do
[02:27:16] all almost nothing unless you actually
[02:27:18] use a C6 so in a single Target situation
[02:27:20] none of his constellations do anything
[02:27:22] except C1 gives you a little bit and C5
[02:27:24] gives you like 2% and it's like okay so
[02:27:26] then I'll like do some like normal [ __ ]
[02:27:28] that a free like you know like good
[02:27:29] artifacts will be able to do and be oh
[02:27:31] it's cuz you have show so it tilts me so
[02:27:34] I don't like pulling for constellations
[02:27:35] that much um but I would definitely get
[02:27:37] D Leaf Madam ping I would
[02:27:39] C6 oh Madam ping Madam ping you would
[02:27:42] see Z like like the curtain model or

[02:27:49] memes right just for the memes like it's
[02:27:51] not uh just it'd be really funny right

[02:28:19] sick what's up she domain expansions in
[02:28:22] the teapot yeah domain expansions wait

[02:32:27] for mentioning mint given the current
[02:32:29] landscape next question uh question
[02:32:33] actually wait you're asking me oh yeah
[02:32:36] yeah I'm asking you give me a second
[02:32:37] yeah I'm literally trying to find what
[02:32:38] that's good and they're all kind
[02:32:41] of uh okay you know
[02:32:45] what
[02:32:49] those memories so dark so dark okay
[02:32:52] thank you for recovering the silence
[02:32:55] what's your genuine opinions on Fontaine
[02:32:58] like characters are Conquest
[02:33:00] Etc oh that's great I love finina uh I
[02:33:04] love I think the AR Quest was amazing I
[02:33:06] think recency bias makes everyone think
[02:33:08] well okay recency bias every time
[02:33:10] there's a quest that's decent everyone's
[02:33:11] going to say it's the best I think still
[02:33:13] though now having like a bit of time for
[02:33:15] it to simmer I really like it
[02:33:18] personally I think I haven't decided if
[02:33:22] I like it more than suar or not cuz I
[02:33:23] also really liked not every suar Quest
[02:33:25] but like the starting ones like 3.2 and
[02:33:27] the other one like Nita and I also
[02:33:29] really really really really liked Kerry
[02:33:31] bear that's probably my favorite Quest
[02:33:32] Carri bear anyways but font was really
[02:33:34] good and the finina like storyline was
[02:33:36] really good I think both were good but
[02:33:39] font's not done yet like there's still
[02:33:40] more like uh we're going to get like a
[02:33:42] Dan's Leaf Quest I think but anyways we
[02:33:46] we we we might I don't know I don't 4.5
[02:33:49] you know I think that's a 4.6 thing but
[02:33:51] I'm not sure like I'm pretty sure that
[02:33:52] happens every patch it's like the Aron
[02:33:54] Quest and then Dan's Leaf like a bit
[02:33:55] later I don't know yeah anyways why what
[02:33:59] are your thoughts I think I was the uh
[02:34:01] holy [ __ ] go I didn't say star that's
[02:34:03] you okay but anyways uh yeah I've never
[02:34:06] I'll be honest I might be the only
[02:34:07] person that did not cry during the
[02:34:09] archon quest 4 for yeah I am a Shain so
[02:34:13] I don't feel emotion so I didn't cry but
[02:34:14] it definitely was yeah uh it was
[02:34:17] definitely um I liked it and it was
[02:34:20] definitely
[02:34:23] emotional you you didn't you serious you
[02:34:26] didn't cry can can chat vouch for you no
[02:34:28] I didn't cry but I was like I was like
[02:34:29] you know like I was like feeling things
[02:34:32] I'll be honest I I think I
[02:34:34] last I okay okay but like but but wait
[02:34:40] you thought it was
[02:34:41] ass no I I I laughed
[02:34:45] oh
[02:34:46] uh I I don't know it's just it's like I
[02:34:48] don't I mean we all C
[02:34:53] differently okay true true true by the
[02:34:55] way this thing TS your damage in half
[02:34:57] just invalid and it's extra anemo
[02:34:59] resistant this is what I was talking
[02:35:00] about anemo is [ __ ] against the
[02:35:04] boss I'm think I think I'm doing a lot
[02:35:07] of damage yeah I saw this one streamer
[02:35:09] she cried the entire Quest like two
[02:35:11] boxes of Kleenex gone oh Jesus Christ
[02:35:14] yeah like two boxes of the Kleen ax gone
[02:35:17] like there were like Billy Billy
[02:35:18] compilations of
[02:35:21] it two boxes yeah oh my
[02:35:25] God I think I go through that in like a
[02:35:27] week but oh really well my nose actually
[02:35:30] gets running quite a bit so I do too oh
[02:35:31] yeah yeah I literally like blew my nose
[02:35:33] before stream and I was like lowkey
[02:35:34] bleeding a
[02:35:36] little I wish I was making that UPG
[02:35:38] those stupid allergies stupid allergies
[02:35:44] yeah
[02:35:46] stop is this
[02:35:50] one does your chat have any questions
[02:35:54] or uh I'm waiting for you to ask me
[02:35:57] questions oh you're ask chat mind mine
[02:35:59] again okay never mind uh holy [ __ ] okay
[02:36:03] let
[02:36:04] me name something that's
[02:36:07] not okay okay this one this one you're
[02:36:09] going to have a field day of but would
[02:36:12] you recommend becoming a Shain if so why
[02:36:14] go off no no question what like yes but
[02:36:18] you don't choose your main your main
[02:36:19] chooses you I don't have to have time to
[02:36:21] get into the theory right now but you
[02:36:22] don't choose your main your main chooses
[02:36:24] you if Shia chooses you you main Shia
[02:36:26] like there's a reason why a lot of mains
[02:36:27] of a lot of characters like have similar
[02:36:29] traits and qualities okay because the
[02:36:32] like yeah sometimes you might lose your
[02:36:33] 50-50 oh maybe I should try this
[02:36:34] character or like whatever like you're
[02:36:35] building pity CU you're weird but it's
[02:36:37] fine but it's like the main the
[02:36:39] character will attract certain players
[02:36:41] and if Shia calls you then you should
[02:36:43] answer the call but if he doesn't then
[02:36:44] he might not be for you
[02:36:47] okay I love Shia so but I'm not going to
[02:36:51] like be like everyone needs to play Shia
[02:36:53] if if you are someone who who who who
[02:36:55] Shia calls to then you are someone who
[02:36:57] sh calls to so you so you resonate with
[02:37:01] the characters you have you have to
[02:37:02] resonate with your character I don't
[02:37:04] know maybe I don't know if resonates the
[02:37:06] word like I get what you're saying but
[02:37:08] I'm not saying like you have to be like
[02:37:10] yeah he's so relatable I'm Shia I'm
[02:37:12] Wanderer I am sad but it's like you know
[02:37:15] there's more complexity to the
[02:37:16] characters than that that's not what I'm
[02:37:18] saying don't get mad at me I love you
[02:37:19] Scara and I love you Scara Ms anyways um
[02:37:22] but
[02:37:23] like you know like there's like okay and
[02:37:26] I I okay so for like smash for example
[02:37:28] like smash like Melee there's like a
[02:37:30] saying well it's not a saying but I
[02:37:31] heard one guy say like okay like all
[02:37:33] Falco players like they they they were
[02:37:35] born as Falco players like you don't
[02:37:37] choose to main Falco it's like he calls
[02:37:39] you and it's the same with Shia it's
[02:37:40] like you know like there's a reason why
[02:37:42] Hut profile pictures in Co-op like you
[02:37:44] you can you can tell what's going to
[02:37:46] happen like you know they're going to
[02:37:50] Yap they're like
[02:37:52] menaces uh-huh so like do you have to
[02:37:55] like is there like special like like
[02:37:56] requirements like you know like like I
[02:37:58] don't know like physical attributes or
[02:38:00] like uh well you have to be tall but a
[02:38:03] lot of it is just like it kind of like
[02:38:05] calls to you you know it's like he calls
[02:38:07] to you like Hear My Call call my name
[02:38:10] and I will be there that you know okay
[02:38:12] so you you should have to call his name
[02:38:14] and and he will be there then
[02:38:16] yeah okay
[02:38:17] yeah okay does that answer your question
[02:38:20] so
[02:38:22] basically only if you're
[02:38:25] tall I mean I don't know the more that
[02:38:28] main Shia the marrier but you don't want
[02:38:29] someone who main Shia for the wrong
[02:38:31] reasons you get
[02:38:32] me like I'm not going to tell you to
[02:38:34] pull for Shia because I think you need
[02:38:36] him but if you're like I like sh should
[02:38:38] I pull yeah get
[02:38:39] him okay okay so pull for whoever you
[02:38:42] want
[02:38:44] true yeah but but some but also this
[02:38:46] this something people get confused too
[02:38:48] you also need to like some people want
[02:38:49] to be able to clear the abyss without
[02:38:51] needing [ __ ] 10 million years of
[02:38:52] investment so sometimes strength is fun
[02:38:54] like for some people character that's
[02:38:56] cool that's fun that is what they want
[02:38:58] but for other people a character that is
[02:39:00] actually good might be more enjoyable
[02:39:02] and that's okay too I hate The Meta
[02:39:04] versus casual discourse like both like
[02:39:06] you know whatever's fun to you they're
[02:39:09] both cool true true true true true I I I
[02:39:13] say that to my child all the time true I
[02:39:15] was like they're like asking me who who
[02:39:16] who who they should pull from like okay
[02:39:18] do you want like like what are you like
[02:39:20] what are you asking yeah what are you
[02:39:22] asking are you like are you like a are
[02:39:24] you pulling for for the visuals like the
[02:39:26] visuals like super shy super like you
[02:39:29] pulling for the visuals or are
[02:39:32] you yeah are you pulling for the visuals
[02:39:35] or are you you know big numbers and then
[02:39:39] they and they they just leave my chat
[02:39:40] cuz they can't answer that question so
[02:39:41] okay let's go yeah now I get
[02:39:44] that
[02:39:46] those memories are lost to dark B I
[02:39:50] don't I don't know this this this might
[02:39:51] actually take five years the shield
[02:39:53] never breaks I'm pretty sure we can just
[02:39:54] swirl everything cuz R sha true oh
[02:39:59] unless oh my God we must be the goats of
[02:40:02] genin impact best character in the game
[02:40:04] because everything true unless
[02:40:08] yeah it's like how Kaza sucks all the
[02:40:11] shields when there's like Abyss Mages
[02:40:12] and you just clear with Kaza yeah I just
[02:40:14] suck I just suck yep go go go go go boom
[02:40:19] nice good
[02:40:21] [ __ ] should I claim this do I need this
[02:40:23] anything

[02:40:32] them like the like three maybe
[02:40:35] four are you trying to like like yeah

[02:40:40] level 90 yeah this I'm trying eventually
[02:40:42] like I want all my characters to be like
[02:40:44] good that's my goal long term when I'm
[02:40:46] done with
[02:40:47] Vermilion when you're oh when you're
[02:40:49] done with Vermillion yeah so in like
[02:40:51] five to six so I'll see you in genjin
[02:40:53] Impact too yeah okay 5 six

[02:41:00] R the or VIPs around the numbers and it
[02:41:02] was like if I just did Mora instead of
[02:41:05] Vermillion I'd have like over a billion
[02:41:07] like it'd be like an insane
[02:41:09] amount a damn yeah I actually might be
[02:41:12] able to pull it up what are you what

[02:41:38] pun um okay yeah but like my Shia I want
[02:41:41] him to be like rank one so I can make a
[02:41:42] video on it but for real like right now

[02:57:21] the point like the sh mask on like my
[02:57:24] shoulder I would get a sleeve if I was

[03:06:43] like a cummer

[03:06:48] one Chad I link this this

[03:07:11] of her yeah it's a pin it's like you you
[03:07:13] put it on like something like like you
[03:07:16] like your backpack no I'm not going out
[03:07:17] with a [ __ ] backpack full of pins I'm
[03:07:19] I'm going out with like a like I put it
[03:07:21] on like my actually what do I actually
[03:07:23] what do I even put pins on I don't know
[03:07:24] I just have them yeah you put pins on
[03:07:26] backpacks yes you put PS on backpacks
[03:07:29] guess you do I don't know I don't put
[03:07:31] things on anything clothes you just go
[03:07:32] out with your clo like how absurd I
[03:07:35] guess you do I don't
[03:07:37] know this is the last one what is
[03:07:39] this but you play you play honai Third
[03:07:42] no no no like I like it I'm open to
[03:07:45] sponsorships by the way say you like it
[03:07:47] if you never played it cuz like okay
[03:07:49] here's my take on it I don't know cuz I
[03:07:51] haven't like I've played it a little
[03:07:52] like I had on my phone for a bit like I
[03:07:53] played it a bit but I think I like the
[03:07:54] character design but it's it seems so
[03:07:56] [ __ ] sad and like everyone just dead
[03:07:58] dead dead dead and then you hear a song
[03:07:59] and all hongy players are crying and
[03:08:01] it's like you wake up you play hongkai
[03:08:03] you cry your day is like sad so it's
[03:08:05] like I don't want to inflict that upon
[03:08:06] myself but it looks good like I can
[03:08:08] appreciate the characters like like
[03:08:11] yeah that's kind that that's my kind of
[03:08:14] vibe to be honest but to be fair okay uh
[03:08:17] the only reason okay the only reason why
[03:08:20] I don't play honai
[03:08:21] Third is it's it
[03:08:25] REM it's instanced that's it that's how
[03:08:28] do you even like how do you even trigger
[03:08:30] it okay let's go it's instance oh [ __ ]
[03:08:32] we said it's not like it's like uh yeah
[03:08:34] it's not really like it's I see it's
[03:08:36] instance like all the battles are inst
[03:08:38] it's not like you know just my not my
[03:08:40] type of uh I see game I played Cookie
[03:08:44] Run
[03:08:46] Kingdom you play Cookie Run kingdom yes
[03:08:50] sir wait you say you wait okay how many
[03:08:53] Goa games do you realistically play
[03:08:55] these days like right now it's just uh
[03:08:57] genin star rail woa but it's in the beta
[03:09:00] that's
[03:09:01] it oh my God it's actually dead I'm dead
[03:09:05] that was easy I don't know how anyone
[03:09:06] would die to
[03:09:07] that true you know what that was a
[03:09:09] glitch that was a glitch like like you
[03:09:11] you've seen it you've seen it multiple
[03:09:12] times right uh no what do you mean no I
[03:09:16] have not seen that glitch where you die
[03:09:17] I have I I have I have witnesses that
[03:09:19] has said that you've died to H glitches
[03:09:22] before yeah but not that one like that
[03:09:25] was just a skillet Sho just just like I
[03:09:27] drowned in font once I actually jumped
[03:09:29] in a pool on Fontaine with nevet and it
[03:09:31] drowned me for some reason but that was
[03:09:33] a glitch
[03:09:35] okay okay yeah yeah
[03:09:40] sure like a swimming glitch yeah
[03:09:46] yeah okay yeah seahorse seahorse SE got
[03:09:49] seahorse SE horse um you know I'm sans's
[03:09:53] voice actor from undertale
[03:09:57] listen I I literally have never played
[03:09:59] undertale have you ever gotten a Skype
[03:10:06] call
[03:10:08] thoughts you're that's actually not bad
[03:10:11] yes sir
[03:10:14] okay
[03:10:16] sorry okay okay
[03:10:19] [Music]
[03:10:21] okay okay this one 10 up boats how many
[03:10:25] made them beloved in your inventory a
[03:10:27] true Shia have a lot of them okay so I
[03:10:31] farmed vescent venor uh at the start
[03:10:33] more than anyone initially because I was
[03:10:35] prepping for sh okay but the thing is as
[03:10:37] time passes you get such good artifacts
[03:10:39] that you destroy all the old like maiden
[03:10:41] like I'm not keeping Maiden but the ones
[03:10:43] that I kept are [ __ ] insane that's
[03:10:45] what I have a theory anytime you see a
[03:10:46] maiden piece on anyone you know it's
[03:10:48] going to be the most broken [ __ ] you've
[03:10:49] ever
[03:10:50] seen cuz with maidens you only keep the
[03:10:52] really good off pieces right okay so I
[03:10:56] have six many but like my feather
[03:10:59] has six maidens you won't be laughing
[03:11:02] when you see
[03:11:03] them you know let me send you a picture
[03:11:05] of
[03:11:07] one lay on that is what I'm keeping
[03:11:10] right now it's about the numbers it's
[03:11:11] about the numers it's not about numbers
[03:11:13] about them numbers it's it's it's it's
[03:11:16] about them numbers I have let me let me

[03:29:21] this one's actually real what inspired
[03:29:24] you to start streaming be a
[03:29:27] streamer dude there's so many I grew up
[03:29:30] on like literally like okay I I kind of
[03:29:34] started making videos by accident like I
[03:29:36] just like not by accident but like I was
[03:29:37] just like I want this information no
[03:29:39] one's making it so I'm going to figure
[03:29:40] it out and then make it but like I watch
[03:29:43] like okay you're probably not going to
[03:29:45] know this guy I watch Like bod is like a
[03:29:46] RuneScape YouTuber which I really liked
[03:29:48] I watch like I don't watch cont yeah
[03:29:51] well like also like a lot of like I told
[03:29:52] you like Rec full rad I watched [ __ ]
[03:29:55] Tyler one my whole life uh oh you guys y
[03:30:00] a squad yo a
[03:30:03] squad
[03:30:05] me I don't know there's like a lot of
[03:30:09] honestly like I watch a lot of people
[03:30:11] and a lot of people inspired me in
[03:30:12] different ways I don't have like a
[03:30:14] specific one in mind right now
[03:30:17] but
[03:30:19] um I get it I get it like all like you
[03:30:22] you you've been watching like stream I
[03:30:23] [ __ ] I cannot with this boss yeah I get
[03:30:26] it you like
[03:30:28] sorry okay like you watch like like like
[03:30:31] you've been watching streaming your
[03:30:32] entire you know entire yeah I mean like
[03:30:34] I never so I I mean I I said this on
[03:30:36] stream like but every time I say this
[03:30:38] people glaze me and I'm not trying to
[03:30:39] get glazed but like I initially didn't
[03:30:42] think I was like okay I just wanted to
[03:30:43] make guides because I want to help
[03:30:44] people and it's like the videos that I
[03:30:45] would want like RuneScape has really
[03:30:47] good guides but I felt like genjin for a
[03:30:49] while genjin has a lot of good like
[03:30:51] video makers now I'm not going to act
[03:30:52] like it's just me like there's a lot of
[03:30:53] people that make really good videos even
[03:30:54] if I wasn't there however at the time
[03:30:57] when I was looking stuff up like there's
[03:30:58] a lot of questions that I couldn't
[03:30:59] answer and a lot of stuff that I
[03:31:01] wouldn't like help me the way that I
[03:31:03] wanted to be helped which is kind of why
[03:31:06] okay uh like my first video was
[03:31:08] literally just reviewing a battle pass
[03:31:09] weapon CU I didn't know if it was good
[03:31:10] or not
[03:31:12] but like I always enjoyed streaming more
[03:31:14] I just didn't think I was like
[03:31:17] entertaining enough okay dude streaming
[03:31:18] is like impossible like you if you how
[03:31:20] do you get discovered like you can be
[03:31:21] the funniest person in the world okay
[03:31:23] it's not like a hard like I'm not going
[03:31:24] to be like I get but like how do you get
[03:31:26] discovered like if you're not like if
[03:31:28] you like you could be funny and like
[03:31:30] entertaining but like there's so many
[03:31:33] streamers that it's like hard to like
[03:31:35] make an impact ACH an impact so I was
[03:31:37] like okay well I'll just make
[03:31:39] videos I kind just I happened by
[03:31:42] accident also I died cuz you're
[03:31:43] distracting
[03:31:44] me listen listen listen listen listen
[03:31:47] listen it's okay it's okay it's okay to
[03:31:49] admit to your like you know shortcomings
[03:31:52] get it I'm not short I don't have
[03:31:55] cmings okay
[03:31:57] yeah yeah
[03:31:59] I I mean I I watch I watch stream I
[03:32:03] don't know the because twitch wasn't a
[03:32:06] thing back then when I started watching

[03:32:11] you like on Justin TV oh I also grew up
[03:32:13] with Starcraft like like Day N that also
[03:32:16] anyways yeah keep going sorry dude the

[03:32:42] first uh like sort of like organiz they
[03:32:45] were not organization back then but they
[03:32:46] were like the first

[03:34:51] you have to believe me okay yeah wait
[03:34:53] this thing has a Nemo okay hear me out
[03:34:56] I'm going to give you an idea we're
[03:34:57] going okay back to genin here okay
[03:34:58] here's tell me if this idea would fix
[03:35:00] the not fix but make the game amplifying
[03:35:03] better and would would solve everyone's
[03:35:05] complaints are you ready yeah go go The
[03:35:08] genin Hires one person his name is John
[03:35:11] impact John genin right a likable person
[03:35:14] smiles a lot okay all he has to do is
[03:35:16] listen to the community pretend that he
[03:35:18] cares like hey we hear you yep we'll get
[03:35:20] on that even if nothing changes the fact
[03:35:22] that we have someone listening imagine
[03:35:24] the the the how much more money they
[03:35:26] would make because everyone thinks that
[03:35:27] hey they love us
[03:35:29] boom that just sounds like a therapist
[03:35:33] yeah so everybody should just we should
[03:35:36] just get a genin therapist yes but like
[03:35:39] like someone like dude like hire like
[03:35:41] one person who like like like like cares
[03:35:44] you know they're like yeah man raids are
[03:35:47] coming yeah man we hear
[03:35:50] you their their entire job is just to
[03:35:53] say we hear you no no but like obviously
[03:35:55] they would Implement some quality of
[03:35:56] life but like just like one person who
[03:35:58] like a little like like a like um like
[03:36:00] like what like you your community speaks
[03:36:02] they listen right they like respond
[03:36:04] they'll be like yeah we'll try like some
[03:36:06] kind of manager maybe like a like a
[03:36:08] maybe they have like a title for it like
[03:36:09] a manager for a
[03:36:13] community no no no no it has to be okay
[03:36:16] it's not commun it's not like okay okay
[03:36:19] okay it's like it's like okay it's like
[03:36:21] okay it's like someone okay hear me out
[03:36:23] it's like okay it's like okay it's like
[03:36:26] let's say everyone's like damn I wish
[03:36:28] dea's jump didn't end the burst they
[03:36:30] would be
[03:36:32] like we will see what we can do and then
[03:36:34] everyone's like
[03:36:36] yes wait wait they they just have to say
[03:36:39] that they ideally some things would
[03:36:41] happen sometimes they'd be like hey we
[03:36:43] can't do that some like you know what
[03:36:45] boom we fixed
[03:36:46] it wait what wait what if they they just
[03:36:49] say that and' be like okay we will We
[03:36:51] they would have to do some of the work
[03:36:53] like I'm saying one person that we feel
[03:36:55] like we're not screaming into the void
[03:36:56] you get
[03:36:59] me like I genuinely believe they hear it
[03:37:04] they they like they would have like the
[03:37:07] statistics to sort of like back back
[03:37:10] their decisions you know like they they
[03:37:13] I generally don't think you are shouting
[03:37:16] into a void but I feel like they're like
[03:37:19] I'm just yapping I don't even know what
[03:37:20] I'm saying and then
[03:37:21] they whatever no no I mean obviously
[03:37:24] like like if I'm being real like this
[03:37:26] game is a lot more like casual than like
[03:37:28] I like to make it seems like I get why
[03:37:31] like it's catered towards casual people
[03:37:33] I'm just saying it would be nice to have
[03:37:34] someone who's
[03:37:35] like yeah like this is why our you know
[03:37:38] we choose to do this this is why we you
[03:37:39] know just be cool to like listen to that
[03:37:41] you know it's like cuz like example TFT
[03:37:43] has like more dog like hearstone used to
[03:37:45] have like Ben bro like there used to be
[03:37:46] like people that just like you know Yap
[03:37:47] about what they do like yeah like you
[03:37:50] know we chose to do this because this
[03:37:51] okay so just like just like a reason
[03:37:53] behind decisions that's that's all yeah
[03:37:55] like you know we just listen to stuff oh
[03:37:57] cool boom oh cool yeah no no no I think
[03:38:00] should have that maybe like a
[03:38:02] dialator yeah
[03:38:05] nice be like NP they put that like an
[03:38:07] NPC in the game you could talk to them
[03:38:09] be like true this is this this is why
[03:38:13] this is why de is De
[03:38:16] true oh de all right all right okay

[04:34:58] five let's look at your oh your F rings
[04:35:01] are too I see let's look at your Golden
[04:35:03] tro so the flower very nice you got HP
[04:35:06] you got 10 crit rate 14 crit damage
[04:35:08] pretty good feather that's okay
[04:35:11] right it's okay it's okay there's HP
[04:35:14] there's crit damage it's not bad uh Sans
[04:35:16] that is very good Sans that is a very
[04:35:18] good Sans uh typically I would be in a
[04:35:21] bad mood looking at the Sands but it's
[04:35:22] okay uh goblet that is a good goblet
[04:35:25] that is a good goblet you have some Er
[04:35:26] as well finally a finina with some er uh
[04:35:29] ciret is absolute dog [ __ ] uh why H
[04:35:32] you're running [ __ ] attack percent
[04:35:34] like it's [ __ ] it's it's [ __ ]
[04:35:35] Shang Ling sha uh sing Cho but no it's
[04:35:38] finina but it's okay it's okay not

[04:35:42] circuit um FL sound Fairman uh your
[04:35:46] ratio

[04:35:54] is oh you got 16 here I forgot about
[04:35:58] that I mean
[04:36:00] still it's still not that high it's like
[04:36:04] 71
[04:36:07] but it's
[04:36:11] okay it's okay it's a good build it's a
[04:36:14] good build overall I would recommend a
[04:36:15] bit more crit rate even with the weapon
[04:36:18] uh your ER should be fine because you
[04:36:19] get some from the passive uh and it
[04:36:21] depends on your team so I'm going to
[04:36:22] assume ER is fine uh it it depends on
[04:36:25] your team though uh pretty good I would
[04:36:27] just recommend more CR rate I'm working
[04:36:28] on it sounds good let's look at one more
[04:36:30] character kamisato aaka she's on the
[04:36:33] amima kakushi good uh free to play
[04:36:35] weapon for blizzard Strayer this means
[04:36:36] you don't actually need a lot of er not
[04:36:38] crowned at all which means you don't
[04:36:39] respect her so we're going to move to
[04:36:40] another character none of these
[04:36:41] characters are crowned nevette is Ryden
[04:36:43] double crowned uh you crowned her e for
[04:36:44] an unknown reason but let's look at it
[04:36:46] emblem of SE fate very good circlet very
[04:36:49] good flower very good feather if this go
[04:36:51] Sans isn't good I'm disappointed that's
[04:36:54] actually very good goblet attack with
[04:36:56] double crit are you on engulfing or the
[04:36:57] catch on favonius Lance uh truly a a
[04:37:00] weapon of all time uh that's
[04:37:04] good
