[00:33:38] pressed leave like for now but then it
[00:33:39] like abandoned the mission and then I
[00:33:41] got a cut scene and then so I think I
[00:33:43] just lost something I don't know what I
[00:33:44] was doing but I like lost some side
[00:33:45] commission so I don't know how the [ __ ]
[00:33:47] that even happened but whatever it is
[00:33:48] what it is it is what it is I didn't
[00:33:50] mean dude I didn't mean to but it is
[00:33:51] what it
[00:33:54] is oh yeah let me use my own agents what
[00:33:56] the
[00:33:59] [ __ ] I okay I wanted to try the blue
[00:34:03] onuaku
[00:34:06] fredd let's
[00:34:08] try included on yeah it's good but why
[00:34:11] are you asking this
[00:34:13] now what we're going to play genon later
[00:34:15] I think unless we get
[00:34:18] addicted EO reference she's an
[00:34:24] Oni cuz you're the only one for me who
[00:34:27] the [ __ ]
[00:34:29] skip we made
[00:34:32] it Vision Corporation has it monitoring
[00:34:34] station
[00:34:36] here the train also stops
[00:34:40] nearby to avoid alerting any also okay
[00:34:44] I'm going to say it I'm going to say it
[00:34:45] I'm going to say
[00:34:47] it this TV system low key respectfully
[00:34:52] if you're watching Hoovers needs an
[00:34:54] upgrade I dude [ __ ] these
[00:34:57] TVs but I don't know how to change it I
[00:34:59] think you should just like take the SL
[00:35:01] the fire route and then make it more Rog
[00:35:02] likee or or just [ __ ] kill the TVs it
[00:35:06] has to work cuz like it's a cool concept
[00:35:08] but after playing it for 20 hours it
[00:35:10] gets
[00:35:12] annoying still the beta yeah this still
[00:35:14] early beta so like feedback constructive
[00:35:21] criticism isn't HSR that STS clone uh if
[00:35:26] you're talking about like swarm disaster
[00:35:28] kind like I guess but swarm disaster is
[00:35:30] the best mode they ever added SL fire is
[00:35:32] such a good game that any clone of it
[00:35:34] will be good cuz it's just the best game
[00:35:36] ever
[00:35:38] standing I'm standing still she said
[00:35:41] whoa whoa
[00:35:43] whoa I just want to see this girl's Al

[00:36:01] you're ever in okay code stream make
[00:36:03] sure he's not playing a character that
[00:36:05] either you or I like because everyone he
[00:36:07] plays in a beta gets

[00:36:13] just makes them get nerfed so whenever I
[00:36:16] see code playing a character I like I'm

[01:22:29] sure the I'm sure there's a meta that's
[01:22:32] developed already
[01:22:35] right I feel like the only times I die
[01:22:37] in this game mode is when I go too fast
[01:22:38] but like I don't want to go slow going
[01:22:40] slow is cringe no give me
[01:22:44] this [ __ ] I'm

[01:22:52] inside of game
[01:22:55] begin wait this is a bad spawn cuz I
[01:22:57] have to break this [ __ ] thing I
[01:23:00] actually don't know what the Met is
[01:23:01] other than getting a good
[01:23:02] spawn cuz like is there actually any
[01:23:04] like more things you like okay the end
[01:23:06] is kind of skillful but like the start
[01:23:08] is literally just mashing a
[01:23:10] button can I get this HP no I can't this
[01:23:13] one dude what is this [ __ ] all well I'm
[01:23:16] griefing this is like like this is like
[01:23:19] a [ __ ] spawn but I don't know if I could
[01:23:20] be playing better like I mean I'm
[01:23:21] totally
[01:23:24] go
[01:23:27] [Applause]
[01:23:30] ahead like should I went for that gold
[01:23:42] thing are you okay I didn't die I was
[01:23:45] going to I was literally going to eat my

[01:24:44] I should went okay I thought that
[01:24:45] Boulder to the right was going to hit I
[01:24:47] thought why did it stop midair wait why
[01:24:49] do Boulders stop midair that's not how
[01:24:50] gravity works why the [ __ ] did it stop
[01:24:52] midair that's not how gravity
[01:25:01] works I could also drift more in the air
[01:25:03] I was debating if I should do that like
[01:25:05] instead of plunging like that you could
[01:25:08] drift which might be better to like
[01:25:10] evaluate where you're
[01:25:11] going but I don't
[01:25:14] know go
[01:25:16] ahead [ __ ] I have to break this [ __ ]
[01:25:18] that is such a waste of

[01:26:55] [Applause]
[01:27:02] wait this is op maybe the way you get a
[01:27:04] good score is you just get this power
[01:27:11] [Applause]
[01:27:16] up oh they call me the movement Master
[01:27:20] nope stay here
[01:27:23] ah that was a grief I should have just
[01:27:24] [Applause]
[01:27:25] went fine we're fully jump bro the [ __ ]

[01:27:37] not
[01:27:41] left nope
[01:27:51] chill
[01:27:52] sometimes I expect a block to fall and
[01:27:54] it doesn't fall and I don't understand
[01:27:55] the
[01:28:03] gravity
[01:28:07] boo
[01:28:15] F so I got that HP midair sheesh
[01:28:21] sheesh dude my my I almost H my throat
[01:28:24] my

[01:28:44] HP I need HP I need
[01:28:51] HP HP M
[01:28:57] check why did that one stop midair how
[01:29:00] does that even happen how does gravity
[01:29:01] pull them to the right but not to the
[01:29:03] left like
[01:29:09] [Applause]
[01:29:15] what no oh you [ __ ] no this game sucks
[01:29:20] this game sucks this game sucks this
[01:29:21] game sucks this game sucks this game
[01:29:22] sucks this game sucks this game sucks
[01:29:24] this game
[01:29:31] sucks bro blames physics for skill issue
[01:29:35] okay if there's if there's blocks here
[01:29:37] and here and then this one Falls but
[01:29:39] this one stays in the air what's
[01:29:50] happening
[01:29:54] [Music]
[01:29:58] I'm not running an ad
[01:30:04] now that actually hurts my
[01:30:08] wrist I feel like did do people have
[01:30:11] like 1K score now what's the highest
[01:30:13] score right now damn 1,800 how the [ __ ]
[01:30:16] do you had
[01:30:18] 1,800 spiky blocks and dark blue ones
[01:30:21] don't fall or
[01:30:26] really wait which ones are spiky oh yeah
[01:30:28] spiky yeah obviously those don't fall oh
[01:30:30] the black ones just don't wait they do
[01:30:32] fall look they're falling look at the
[01:30:34] [ __ ] trailer they're
[01:30:36] falling look look look look look the
[01:30:38] [ __ ] look the the purple one Falls oh
[01:30:41] it stops wait when does it stop oh it
[01:30:43] only goes one oh only goes one tile wait
[01:30:46] let me try
[01:30:48] this wait wait wait let's see let's see
[01:30:50] let's see let's test the theory
[01:30:53] oh yeah it literally just does not
[01:30:55] fall what about here okay here it falls
[01:30:57] wait why did it fall there does it fall
[01:31:00] if other blocks are
[01:31:02] falling I
[01:31:04] see or does it get stuck next to the
[01:31:07] other ones wait why does it what why is
[01:31:09] it not falling
[01:31:14] here I don't understand the gravity of
[01:31:16] this
[01:31:20] game
[01:31:24] [Applause]
[01:31:29] oh okay just sticks if it sees us
[01:31:30] something of the same color I
[01:31:36] see okay that makes sense so there it
[01:31:39] wouldn't hit me here it won't hit well
[01:31:40] it'll stop there
[01:31:43] okay so like here okay that makes sense
[01:31:47] okay makes
[01:31:50] sense
[01:31:56] Theory crafting zzz's
[01:32:07] TCG well I already lost life I don't
[01:32:09] know why I'm going to keep going
[01:32:13] but okay wait is there anything else I
[01:32:15] don't
[01:32:20] know what what the the [ __ ] does this
[01:32:22] thing do what the [ __ ] is a chili pepper
[01:32:24] oh wait no that doesn't do anything what
[01:32:25] the [ __ ] does it
[01:32:35] do Shang
[01:32:38] Ling maybe it just summons goo
[01:32:49] actually
[01:32:50] GG made everything the same color I
[01:32:55] see okay I'm
[01:32:57] learning okay he learned I understand
[01:33:00] how this
[01:33:01] works we're going to get a million right
[01:33:05] now is there a better strategy than SPL
[01:33:07] spam plunging like do I want to go slow
[01:33:09] and actually think about what I'm doing
[01:33:10] cuz I could like we could slow it down
[01:33:12] but I don't know if slowing is the play
[01:33:14] cuz like if I slow down I could get this
[01:33:16] thing look like I could like do this and
[01:33:17] then that and then they fall on me and
[01:33:19] then I move like I could like but I
[01:33:20] don't know if that's better
[01:33:22] I guess it
[01:33:30] is go
[01:33:32] ahead yeah your HP does drain fast later
[01:33:35] oh I'm
[01:33:37] [Music]
[01:33:40] dead what even is the Strat is just run
[01:33:44] cuz we can
[01:33:47] run I take
[01:33:50] damage
[01:33:54] So It
[01:33:57] Begins maybe at the start we go so to
[01:33:59] get like power ups and [ __ ] like this
[01:34:03] thing well that thing doesn't really do
[01:34:05] anything I mean I guess it helps I need
[01:34:08] HP though no I missed
[01:34:14] it I'm I'm
[01:34:20] dead So It
[01:34:26] Begins maybe I got to be like a midair
[01:34:28] swerer like here we wait get
[01:34:31] this I thought I could I was like wait I
[01:34:33] can't eat up wait I got it I got it I
[01:34:36] actually got it I actually got it okay
[01:34:38] I've TC in my mind now I know what I'm
[01:34:39] going to do I know what I'm going to do
[01:34:40] no no just keep
[01:34:50] going
[01:34:52] here we just go here we just [ __ ] go
[01:34:53] it doesn't matter okay now now I choose
[01:34:56] this path that was the worst path I
[01:34:58] should have went to the right it's fine
[01:35:00] no we got an HP so it's
[01:35:02] worth
[01:35:04] bro bro I
[01:35:06] can't
[01:35:09] well it won't let me go
[01:35:14] right fine I didn't I didn't lose a
[01:35:18] life I I just lost the gold thing
[01:35:20] whatever that was it might have been an
[01:35:21] extra HP
[01:35:25] thing
[01:35:28] no what am I doing what am I doing I was
[01:35:31] trying to get the HP I'm stupid it's
[01:35:32] fine I I go in here I'm full HP doesn't
[01:35:33] matter I'm literally full HP it doesn't
[01:35:35] matter I just should have had the gold
[01:35:37] thing the gold thing could have been an
[01:35:38] extra life as long as they give you
[01:35:40] that this like a bad path but I don't
[01:35:42] know how to change paths maybe that's
[01:35:44] the play maybe I need to like go to the
[01:35:45] right and left
[01:35:48] more like here [ __ ] dude [ __ ] the middle
[01:35:55] no oh my God oh my God oh my God wait
[01:35:58] I'm
[01:36:01] fine this is such a bad path why am I
[01:36:04] here oh cuz I get
[01:36:06] the Among
[01:36:09] Us full HP full
[01:36:18] HP stay in the middle like you a little
[01:36:23] don't want to
[01:36:26] riddle okay here I swerve no you
[01:36:37] [ __ ] oh my God he's gaming no I didn't

[01:37:18] start I actually never cared about
[01:37:20] anything actually actually oh my
[01:37:26] no okay I learned I learned though that
[01:37:28] was a good death cuz we learned it was a
[01:37:30] good death cuz we learned it was a good

[01:46:45] abysses because for example like
[01:46:48] recently a lot of abysses were like just
[01:46:49] [ __ ] for shot so he'd be like way lower
[01:46:52] usage rate than normal and I don't want
[01:46:53] to be like I don't want to be the like
[01:46:55] one guys that pretend that like a

[01:47:39] in the last
[01:47:42] Abyss but also okay here's another okay
[01:47:45] I'm I'm going to say this in the nicest
[01:47:47] way possible my Shia has
[01:47:51] been higher investment than most Chows
[01:47:54] since version 1.3 and it's at the point
[01:47:57] where if you pull for him you probably
[01:48:00] can invest into him at least to the
[01:48:02] level that I was 3 years
[01:48:04] ago I know Lux involved in it but like
[01:48:07] bro it's been 3
[01:48:17] years which is better than now true

[02:06:07] best two stacks of inside I don't know
[02:06:09] what that is but give me I want them
[02:06:17] all
[02:06:21] sorry I just I flashed back to Shang
[02:06:23] Ling I miss
[02:06:25] her
[02:06:28] sorry I don't know why I just changling
[02:06:35] oted behave now you know I have to
[02:06:39] explain to Yuli why Shang Ling was the
[02:06:41] OPA emote like he genuinely would not
[02:06:43] understand I have to like break it down
[02:06:44] from him so for those of you who don't
[02:06:47] know it's so the OT is called
[02:06:49] like Korean gamer Rage 3 or something
[02:06:51] and it's referencing a Korean streamer
[02:06:53] breaking his keyboard okay and I think
[02:06:56] that that is the average that is your
[02:06:58] reaction to seeing Shang Ling mentioned
[02:07:00] again because it's always Shang Ling so
[02:07:02] whenever I I mention Shang Ling I
[02:07:04] imagine everyone in chat is breaking
[02:07:06] their keyboard the way that Opa
[02:07:10] is speaking of opa I think we're going
[02:07:12] to be doing 10 has account review in

[02:42:59] by the way that
[02:43:02] here do you know what the quality of
[02:43:04] information was when when genin first
[02:43:07] came out let alone in the closed
[02:43:14] beta
[02:43:19] here or randomiz hey everyone Mt here
[02:43:23] and I Wish future Mt could have told
[02:43:26] past Mt all about these artifacts
[02:43:29] because I made some dumb mistakes see
[02:43:33] that was the starter in that's where we
[02:43:35] were at at the start of genin helpful
[02:43:38] video by the way for 3 years ago no FL
[02:43:40] helpful for 3 years ago but I'm saying
[02:43:42] that's where we're at with zenas except
[02:43:44] it's still the beta we're not even there
[02:43:46] right
[02:43:48] now whoa efficient artifact guide save
[02:43:51] your resin wait how does this video have
[02:43:52] a million views I didn't even know it
[02:43:53] had a million views what the [ __ ] what
[02:43:54] do I say hey what's up guys today we're
[02:43:56] going to talk about artifacts and how to
[02:43:58] be efficient with them we're going to be
[02:43:59] covering what artifacts you should throw
[02:44:01] away and fodder into XP and what
[02:44:03] artifacts you should keep for your
[02:44:04] current characters and for future
[02:44:05] characters that might come out Mount to
[02:44:08] be able to spam their burst on cool low
[02:44:10] key this video should be remade it's not
[02:44:12] bad but this was before dendro it was
[02:44:14] before like we we had like one HP
[02:44:16] scaling character right do we even have
[02:44:18] any Yol isn't out who the [ __ ] wait let
[02:44:20] me look shinan yeah we had like Jong Lee
[02:44:23] that's
[02:44:26] it what patch was this August 2021 we
[02:44:30] set your plume is always going to be
[02:44:31] attack your flower is always going to be
[02:44:32] HP look at that dude oh my God look at
[02:44:35] this flower oh my oh my God look at this
[02:44:37] flower because the main stats are always
[02:44:38] set your plume is always one and to be
[02:44:41] set your plume is always going to beack
[02:44:42] PL look at this oh my oh my God imagine
[02:44:45] that on Vermilion oh my God oh my God I
[02:44:49] didn't even have Vermillion Vermilion
[02:44:51] wasn't even out back then always going
[02:44:52] to
[02:44:57] ATT but do keep I mean this is actually
[02:45:00] fair this is still accurate but because
[02:45:02] now dendra is out and [ __ ] like like em
[02:45:05] and like even HP scaling characters are
[02:45:07] more prevalent
[02:45:10] but yeah that makes
[02:45:14] sense
[02:45:15] artifacts that have a good ex also
[02:45:18] healing bonus is actually good
[02:45:20] now dog [ __ ] since you're going for one
[02:45:23] on the main stat this good right both
[02:45:25] crit stats support set as I mentioned
[02:45:27] having energy recharge on like the Sands
[02:45:29] and even HP pieces killed this young
[02:45:31] cute Zio what the [ __ ] does that mean HP
[02:45:34] Sands for some healers like diona and
[02:45:36] the same thing for some ciret what is
[02:45:39] this
[02:45:40] emote
[02:45:43] um what the [ __ ] is
[02:45:51] Dodge would it even let me add it oh it
[02:45:53] did okay [ __ ] it we're adding DOD wait
[02:45:55] we already have Dodge though we have we
[02:45:57] have
[02:46:02] Dodge I mean this is I don't know if
[02:46:05] it's good or
[02:46:09] bad it's like healing bonus on this
[02:46:11] specific set can be good so do keep that
[02:46:13] in mind when you're farming no bless
[02:46:14] oblig let me change my category for can
[02:46:16] also be used for like healers and some
[02:46:18] support characters that might want
[02:46:20] different stats also and I thought I
[02:46:21] should mention that for the quote
[02:46:22] unquote bad artifact sets you know sets
[02:46:24] that you're not necessarily using like
[02:46:26] maiden's or for example lava Walker if
[02:46:28] you're not using that set on anyone I
[02:46:30] still recommend keeping the ones that
[02:46:31] have really good substats because they
[02:46:33] can be used as an off piece for example
[02:46:35] since I've done so much Ford as inventor
[02:46:37] I have a lot of Maiden pieces that I can
[02:46:39] use as offset pieces and so I highly
[02:46:41] recommend keeping pieces on bad sets CH
[02:46:43] what videos I need to remake this video
[02:46:45] needs a remake Shang Ling guide oh wait
[02:46:47] wrong one it's all coming out

[02:50:10] seconds which is honestly
[02:50:12] pretty only applies when she's in the
[02:50:15] rushing ice state which is where since

[02:50:19] ton of er at level 90 if you do level it

[02:57:34] or weren't there when it happen remember
[02:57:36] but I was there so I will try my best to
[02:57:38] document what really happened and how it
[02:57:39] affects LeBron's
[02:57:41] [Music]
[02:57:43] Legacy
[02:57:45] yo turn it up this game came out at a
[02:57:47] time where everything was [ __ ] light
[02:57:49] mode Google online classes good evening
[02:57:52] and [ __ ] it's like 10:49 p.m. you got
[02:57:55] viruses and vitamins everywhere
[02:57:57] everyone's just [ __ ] depressed no
[02:57:59] money staying inside all day well that's
[02:58:02] just every year and when we had just a
[02:58:04] few months left in 2020 to say goodbye
[02:58:06] and forget about all that happened this
[02:58:08] gensin I don't really know what that
[02:58:10] says about me if my highlight of 2020
[02:58:13] was a gotcha game coming out but I'll
[02:58:15] take it the release of genin I mean the
[02:58:16] year is pretty dog [ __ ] it's not like
[02:58:18] had a bigger highlight genuinely excited
[02:58:20] to play something rather than just
[02:58:22] playing a game cuz I have nothing to do
[02:58:24] I got to Lea in one
[02:58:27] day and the day after I already maxed
[02:58:30] out the statue what the [ __ ] yo this guy
[02:58:33] needs to okay I know coming from me this
[02:58:36] is going to seem hypocritical but lowkey
[02:58:38] touch grass I know I know I know
[02:58:40] hypocritical I know dude I think it took
[02:58:42] me like literally like a month to
[02:58:45] [ __ ] level my statue my free playay
[02:58:47] account still doesn't have Max stamina
[02:58:49] and he's
[02:58:56] ar46 PS4 players got exclusive weapons
[02:58:59] and gliders little bit of crossplatform
[02:59:01] discrimination but I'll let that slide
[02:59:02] for how fun the game was for the first
[02:59:04] week the map at the time felt like it
[02:59:06] stretches out all the way to China if
[02:59:08] you enhance over exp just dies like you
[02:59:11] don't even get any back you actually had
[02:59:13] to eat it actually did say [ __ ] you
[02:59:15] that's Canon healer back then
[02:59:16] downloading the game was slow as [ __ ] I
[02:59:18] remember the life was to pause and
[02:59:20] unpause to get your internet back 120
[02:59:22] resin I'm pretty sure I started day two
[02:59:24] or I might have started day one but I
[02:59:25] remember everyone when I downloaded
[02:59:28] everyone was like yeah yesterday it was
[02:59:29] impossible to download so I downloaded
[02:59:31] like the day after that [ __ ] happened
[02:59:33] classic sending your characters on an
[02:59:35] expedition made them un game you think
[02:59:39] I'm joking but if it was 120 at release
[02:59:42] and star was already at like 200 surely
[02:59:44] or 240 surely by now we're probably at
[02:59:47] like 200 I haven't logged into genin in
[02:59:49] a while we're probably like 200 as well
[02:59:50] 240 maybe to the mines she's literally
[02:59:52] in the mine spending 20 hours for like
[02:59:54] what eight stone when somebody talked
[02:59:56] about their most hated or least played
[02:59:58] character you would tell them to send
[02:59:59] them on Expedition artifacts dropped on
[03:00:01] the floor so every time [ __ ] there is
[03:00:04] nothing more satisfying I'm sorry that
[03:00:06] [ __ ] cringe Co-op venty ruined this
[03:00:09] [ __ ] you by the way this was so
[03:00:11] beautiful the the five star art back on
[03:00:14] the ground was literally Peak and I
[03:00:15] would do anything to get it back I don't
[03:00:17] care bro if vent's trolling you kick him
[03:00:20] block him report
[03:00:22] him I miss it I don't know I miss it 10
[03:00:25] times you want to be the cause of
[03:00:26] someone's mental breakdown they could
[03:00:27] have also made it single player only the
[03:00:29] H now get an animal character with some
[03:00:32] I guess guess yeah I guess you can't
[03:00:33] check the artifact as fast maybe it was
[03:00:34] just nice for early game I don't know
[03:00:36] man I think it looked sick I don't know
[03:00:38] I'm sorry I think it looked sick here
[03:00:40] you go be the host now get an Animo
[03:00:43] character with some
[03:00:45] suction now whip out that [ __ ] and suck
[03:00:48] all the artifacts into the void yeah
[03:00:51] leave right away if you were a host and
[03:00:54] you leave everyone leaves so you just
[03:00:56] minus five someone's life away cuz you
[03:00:58] got to realize back then nobody did
[03:01:00] damage so your average time was longer
[03:01:02] I'm going to add on to this anyone who
[03:01:04] played the Luke in 1.0 and was trying to
[03:01:07] do the [ __ ] Crimson witch domain that
[03:01:10] [ __ ] was impossible okay especially the
[03:01:12] level I think it might have been the
[03:01:13] level 41 cuz I farmed artifacts before I
[03:01:15] was supposed to you would get shocked if
[03:01:17] you melted a cryo slime so I couldn't
[03:01:20] play my pyro character and my only other
[03:01:22] DPS was Kaa so what the [ __ ] could I do
[03:01:24] it was so hard I had to like I literally
[03:01:26] got Chi-Chi I was like Auto attacking on
[03:01:28] Chi-Chi there's I it took like 20
[03:01:30] minutes pretty buggy I mean that's to be
[03:01:32] expected but there was this venty bug
[03:01:34] where you hold e open camera hide
[03:01:36] character and he just Why access
[03:01:38] indefinitely yeah I didn't know that's
[03:01:40] how you did that once you've had enough
[03:01:41] I've seen people do this but I don't
[03:01:42] know how and you would think gu just be
[03:01:44] on the ground no he TPS to that location
[03:01:46] venty no C remember these limited
[03:01:50] banners oh Banner 1.1 Banner review okay
[03:01:54] or 1.0 I guess okay venty got Shang Ling

[03:02:11] band out gate you know why change walk
[03:02:13] if cute well the CLE Incident That's
[03:02:16] what I'm saying on the topic of CLE one
[03:02:18] of the classic CLE defining moments of
[03:02:20] this era that cement itself in genin
[03:02:23] history this before my time M
[03:02:26] triology is Cle worth
[03:02:30] it I spent
[03:02:32] $2,000 on
[03:02:34] CLE CLE
[03:02:36] [Laughter]
[03:02:38] sucks this became one of the top ginin
[03:02:41] posts on Reddit of all time to this day
[03:02:44] now that just say the word That's a
[03:02:46] classic
[03:02:48] classic no so genin GG used to be that
[03:02:51] website you go to for information and
[03:02:53] guides and they were okay I guess their
[03:02:56] layout was cool but it it caused a lot
[03:02:58] of misinformation cuz they copied a lot
[03:03:00] of [ __ ] now it's better but it's still
[03:03:02] kind of bad I know so I
[03:03:04] know at one point genon G someone there
[03:03:07] reached out to me I was like yo can we
[03:03:08] feature your guides there and I think
[03:03:10] sometimes they still do like in like the
[03:03:11] video section which is good cuz that
[03:03:12] helped add information
[03:03:14] but their tier list was so bad and
[03:03:16] people thought it was me I'm like dude
[03:03:17] this is not me I didn't make this tier
[03:03:20] list there's like a million genin GG's
[03:03:23] GG they released this 1.0 tier list
[03:03:26] let's review the review the 1.0 tier
[03:03:28] list okay okay sucros in C tier B in C
[03:03:31] tier Kaa in C tier okay Bennett was B
[03:03:35] Chi-Chi was s to be fair for 1.0 if all
[03:03:38] you needed was healing Chi-Chi was
[03:03:40] cracked like okay she wasn't she made no
[03:03:42] energy okay don't get me wrong but if
[03:03:44] all you care about was healing she felt
[03:03:45] nice to you know put in your team heal a
[03:03:47] bit but Bennett and B was sus sing tro
[03:03:50] and
[03:03:51] B
[03:03:53] yeah
[03:03:55] yeah bet was a late Discovery at least
[03:03:57] for me I figured out BTO was broken
[03:04:00] after a while zff was a b rid or die I
[03:04:02] was official rid or die um but Bennett
[03:04:05] we knew early Bennett like October early
[03:04:07] October we knew benett was good and the
[03:04:10] thing with strangling a was dude the
[03:04:12] thing with strangling I level Shang Ling
[03:04:14] just cuz the first Abyss was a bunch of
[03:04:16] cryo [ __ ] so it's like I might as well
[03:04:17] have another DPS with duuke just to melt
[03:04:19] some things little did I know she would
[03:04:22] soon be the next
[03:04:25] deluke um yeah with these tier lists is
[03:04:28] that every time there's just a Minefield
[03:04:30] in the comment section you can't please
[03:04:32] everybody except this one this one
[03:04:34] doesn't please anybody it's not their
[03:04:36] fault no one knew what was going on in
[03:04:38] 1.0 also for the record venty was
[03:04:40] literally a tier of his own back then uh
[03:04:43] like the the three best characters are
[03:04:44] venty Bennett inro like it was just like
[03:04:46] venty was so [ __ ] broken this one
[03:04:48] doesn't please anybody it's not their
[03:04:50] fault no one knew what was going on in
[03:04:51] 1.0 take me for example 2 years in and I
[03:04:55] still don't know what's going on I found
[03:04:56] an old recording of me playing during
[03:04:58] these times just look at the way I
[03:04:59] played this fight out dude I wish I had
[03:05:01] old
[03:05:04] recordings bro at least attack here we
[03:05:07] go yeah I mean yeah understandable I
[03:05:10] think I'm ort ready this was the day of
[03:05:12] physical Shank
[03:05:14] y FAL Dam it you guys think it's troll
[03:05:17] but back then this [ __ ] was the Wild
[03:05:18] West no artifacts just Spam attack on
[03:05:21] Pike was broken to be fair like as a
[03:05:23] weapon it effect still as good physical
[03:05:25] strong Le with Pike in a hyper bloom or
[03:05:28] super like taser team is actually not
[03:05:30] bad obviously H is better but Pike is
[03:05:32] actually good it it's just not for Shang
[03:05:34] Ling CU Shang Ling is a pyro but like
[03:05:36] for like Jang Lee J Le is like lowkey
[03:05:38] the best physical and let's not forget
[03:05:40] when the banner looked like this see
[03:05:43] this gu right here he was that guy back
[03:05:44] there he
[03:05:45] was AIT sorry shut up no no he's
[03:05:50] summoning bubbles oh hold
[03:05:54] up oh chill chill
[03:05:57] what he this a
[03:06:00] bubble oh hell no Jesus man why are you
[03:06:04] so
[03:06:07] mad he throws out a [ __ ] chicken I
[03:06:10] got to say though I'm not into the hot
[03:06:11] man I like them much cooler we Al had an
[03:06:13] event where if you reach ar20 you get a
[03:06:15] free Barbara wait I don't care what you
[03:06:18] guys say Barbara is actually do we not
[03:06:20] still get we still get free Barbra to
[03:06:21] Crucible yeah that fits our first
[03:06:24] gameplay event this Co-op you kill
[03:06:27] monsters they drop Cub put the cube in
[03:06:30] the oven do it enough times and you win
[03:06:32] now if you didn't play during those well
[03:06:35] then that's really good he's going to
[03:06:37] say it so happy for you but you know
[03:06:40] yeah back in the old days we have to pay
[03:06:43] for for everything even for event it was
[03:06:47] it was literally worse I think it was
[03:06:49] about as good but like a bit worse than
[03:06:50] [ __ ] lay lines like it wasn't
[03:06:52] efficient to claim you could do it and
[03:06:53] get the event roads without claiming
[03:06:55] which is what the meta was but you
[03:06:56] literally could claim like you had to
[03:06:59] spend resin for these XP books you would
[03:07:00] only get like a bit of Primos yeah you
[03:07:03] want those Heroes wits you got to pay it
[03:07:05] up I was I remember everyone was
[03:07:08] complaining I was like this sucks but at
[03:07:10] least I get to play with my friends like
[03:07:11] at least there a co-op event and I was
[03:07:12] like this was at the time where there
[03:07:14] were rumors that the next one would be
[03:07:15] like eight player raids so I was like
[03:07:17] hype I was like yo I can't wait little
[03:07:19] did I know noway right not back then
[03:07:24] back then they weren't free they were
[03:07:26] not free so what you're telling me is
[03:07:27] that they're basically lay lines with
[03:07:29] gameplay despite that I had a ton of fun
[03:07:31] I remember playing this [ __ ] like an MMO
[03:07:33] RPG everyone played their shitty D
[03:07:35] kaching venty oh look at me I want to be
[03:07:37] the I want to do big damage and looking
[03:07:40] at our team's draft there was you
[03:07:42] [ __ ] you better heal cuz I'm not you
[03:07:45] think I care we play just to fail and
[03:07:47] get nothing I got locked Barbara every
[03:07:50] game just to heal so they won't die now
[03:07:53] that that's a classic now if you aren't
[03:07:56] yet convulsing from all the Nostalgia it
[03:07:58] was around this time where conspiracy
[03:08:00] theories started to float around oh no
[03:08:02] all right I say
[03:08:09] uh so you had a bunch of people go
[03:08:12] around and spread just a little bit of
[03:08:13] misin this about respawning uh you know
[03:08:18] I was walking my dog on the roof of
[03:08:19] fonia's headquarters when suddenly
[03:08:21] golden chest just popped out of nowhere
[03:08:23] this is definitely not my first time
[03:08:25] seeing
[03:08:26] it dead ass used to watch those I
[03:08:29] genuinely I think I still have the marks
[03:08:30] on my map of where chess would respawn I
[03:08:33] showed this a like a few streams ago
[03:08:35] yeah I literally believe that the chest
[03:08:37] would respawn all the time in the orange
[03:08:40] [ __ ] on Mount hoola and I literally
[03:08:41] would go through [ __ ] half of monat
[03:08:44] to get see if Chester I'm not kidding
[03:08:47] take a picture and say damn I
[03:08:53] [Music]
[03:09:11] glitch
[03:09:18] yeah
[03:09:21] yeah yeah no it's proof it's actually
[03:09:23] proof dude I I literally I remember
[03:09:25] watching
[03:09:28] video hey guys look at uh this luxurious
[03:09:31] chest on monad I remember getting it a
[03:09:33] few days ago and then I literally I dead
[03:09:35] ass would always TP to the Waypoint
[03:09:38] above the Knights of fonus and go check
[03:09:39] we might as well hey we might have it
[03:09:41] now let me see hey we might have it okay
[03:09:44] it's not
[03:09:45] [Music]
[03:09:51] loading or the one in the bank holy [ __ ]
[03:09:54] this was everywhere at the time so many
[03:09:56] people were saying oh my God make sure
[03:09:58] you come back to the bank uh every few
[03:10:00] days like it was a welfare office oh get
[03:10:02] your free 200k injection every week
[03:10:04] thank you China I mean with all the
[03:10:06] theories and skitso post about the
[03:10:08] golden chest I actually started to doubt
[03:10:10] myself maybe I'm wrong so I blew up
[03:10:12] genin and you know what I'll never trust
[03:10:14] the internet ever again then T hen you
[03:10:17] had quite possibly one of the the worst
[03:10:20] part and like the the like small bit of
[03:10:22] Truth was that you actually got more
[03:10:24] chests when like you would Ascend to a
[03:10:25] different world level they'd add chest
[03:10:27] I'm pretty sure I think that's where it
[03:10:28] would come from is that like you might
[03:10:30] get a chest and you ascend into like
[03:10:31] other chests but like [ __ ] man cuz then
[03:10:33] you would see them everyone's like oh
[03:10:35] chest respond and you be like oh chest
[03:10:36] do respawn and so I kept checking the
[03:10:38] same [ __ ] places the biggest trations
[03:10:41] of all time
[03:10:43] ar42 AA wait this is real though that's
[03:10:46] how I got my AA wait what do you mean

[03:17:32] trying to figure out how to destroy for
[03:17:34] me it was Fenty climbing and I literally
[03:17:36] would play the game on mute cuz every
[03:17:37] time I'd climb in Japanese on venti he
[03:17:40] would just like do a high pitched moan
[03:17:41] and I have to take my earphones off cuz

[03:18:03] my sword there was no dragon spine you

[03:18:11] last Play points this the same I mean I
[03:18:13] guess you have to walk there from datal
[03:18:15] loopa gorgi but there was no dragon
[03:18:17] spine you had to walk everywhere this
[03:18:19] was quite possibly the most menacing
[03:18:21] place to ever exist watching down Oculus
[03:18:24] videos and noting down every and then
[03:18:26] you would miss one so you'd have to Rego

[03:25:42] like the discussion this was a this was
[03:25:44] I'm not going to bring this up but this
[03:25:45] was literally a mod of the Discord kept
[03:25:48] going and it this is like old beef and I
[03:25:51] had beef with like no one I remember I
[03:25:54] this was like old beef boil down to how
[03:25:57] can you math if no money so that was a
[03:25:59] big meme between me and zff like how can
[03:26:01] you math if you're broke ZF basically
[03:26:04] was born like a bit prematurely a bit
[03:26:06] early because he heard someone uh
[03:26:08] basically talking about how bad Bennett
[03:26:10] was that's how he was born he was
[03:26:12] actually born uh recently like after
[03:26:14] genin came out but he spawned as an
[03:26:16] adult so basically someone was just
[03:26:18] playing uh duuke and was like wow this
[03:26:20] is really the best pyro carry Shang Ling
[03:26:22] and Bennett are so bad all other pyro
[03:26:24] characters suck and then zff spawned
[03:26:25] immediately behind them with like he
[03:26:27] didn't even like I don't know how he
[03:26:30] came from he just appeared there spawned
[03:26:32] as a human that was his day one and
[03:26:34] gently whispered into the person's ear
[03:26:37] uh the truth and then they became the

[03:26:55] [Applause]
[03:26:56] the you're lucky I'm
[03:27:00] not then what you want to do is spend
[03:27:02] them on a banner what' the music stop
[03:27:04] this is not normal Z stream where is the
[03:27:05] what the [ __ ] am I playing Ito albo Goro
[03:27:09] literally what are you talking about oh
[03:27:10] yeah cuz the [ __ ] heral you needed to
[03:27:13] you needed [ __ ] why I'm the way that
[03:27:15] I am I'm going to post on YouTube right
[03:27:16] so now I'm going we're going to get
[03:27:17] YouTube frogs okay so chat be on your
[03:27:19] best behavior and I'm going to be on my
[03:27:21] best behavior I'm not going to be Pogo
[03:27:23] today no weirdness nothing weird no
[03:27:25] jokes only optimal gameplay look at how
[03:27:28] cringe chat is like can you guys even
[03:27:30] see the chat no deaths and good content
[03:27:33] okay that that like for me I expect good
[03:27:35] behavior from me and from you guys chat
[03:27:36] okay we're going to work together came
[03:27:38] from YouTube I'm confused if you're new
[03:27:40] and you're from YouTu YouTube uh I just
[03:27:42] want you to know like I'm like the same
[03:27:44] you know same type of person [ __ ] dude I
[03:27:46] used to try to convince people I'm the
[03:27:48] same now I just told them to run why is
[03:27:50] there a section called
[03:27:52] gearing 86 137 without uh Sky harp when
[03:27:56] I put Sky harp increase some people say
[03:28:00] oh gearing BGE Zio gearing that's going
[03:28:02] to take 10 to 15 business days bedge but
[03:28:06] think about it you watch my YouTube
[03:28:07] videos to learn how to gear your
[03:28:08] characters so why not watch How I gear
[03:28:11] my had a sub goal called unlock all way
[03:28:13] points bro that was the biggest scam I
[03:28:17] don't even have I still don't even have
[03:28:19] every Waypoint I literally still don't
[03:28:21] have every
[03:28:23] Waypoint wait Coos you actually gifted
[03:28:26] for that I remember yeah you got scammed
[03:28:28] I'm sorry is live instead so you Bank
[03:28:31] all the knowledge so I would technically
[03:28:33] argue that the rest of the stream is
[03:28:35] badge and me gearing is actually woked
[03:28:37] so that is what I'm going to do I want
[03:28:39] okay the whole point the whole reason I
[03:28:41] went to gear the only reason I went to
[03:28:45] gear was to give my Yi more ER and now
[03:28:48] all I'm doing is competing with another
[03:28:50] streamer who's my friend and who we're
[03:28:51] not even in a competition with because
[03:28:53] some idiot in chat said oh Cho has a
[03:28:56] larger Cho after stream is gearing half
[03:28:58] your face is gearing bro why are you
[03:29:00] guys typing badge it's not badge it's
[03:29:02] hype when I gear okay that's enough what
[03:29:04] the [ __ ] is this why would I open MS
[03:29:07] paint so what you want to do here wait I
[03:29:09] remember this I can literally explain
[03:29:11] what this drawing is cuz I'm an artist
[03:29:12] look look there's two ruined serpents
[03:29:14] and okay here's exactly what what it is
[03:29:16] there's two ruined serpents and they
[03:29:18] would dig to you the 50% chance they dig
[03:29:20] 50% chance they and then they don't dig
[03:29:22] what you had to do is have you ran to
[03:29:25] one and hope the other dug to you or you
[03:29:28] rather let me restart you ran to the one
[03:29:30] that wasn't digging so that the the
[03:29:32] other one would dig to the one that
[03:29:34] wasn't digging and if both of them dog
[03:29:36] you win if both of them don't dig you
[03:29:39] lose and you reset is if you think
[03:29:41] they're both going to dig you could like
[03:29:42] theoretically go to this guy and then
[03:29:43] they both dig there but that's probably
[03:29:45] not going to happen so what you do is
[03:29:46] you kind of wait you see which one digs
[03:29:49] yep cuz then there's a 75% chance that
[03:29:51] at least one of them is going to dig
[03:29:52] right so when one of them digs you go to
[03:29:55] the other one that didn't dig let's say
[03:29:56] this guy digs and he he's going to TP to
[03:29:58] you you run to this one that's doing
[03:30:00] this and then you you go over there and
[03:30:03] then you're here and then this guy digs
[03:30:04] to you and then this guy comes to you
[03:30:05] and they're all there now if the other
[03:30:07] one digs you go to that one now if both
[03:30:09] of them dig you just go to the big dude
[03:30:10] and then they both dig to you and then
[03:30:12] they're all there and then and then you
[03:30:13] win now if none of them dig this is
[03:30:15] where things get interesting if this guy
[03:30:17] doesn't dig and he does those and then
[03:30:19] this guy doesn't dig he what do you do
[03:30:21] you reset because the game [ __ ] you
[03:30:23] and you got [ __ ] by RNG basically
[03:30:24] cosplay being a Ula man and you press
[03:30:26] the retry bar forever dude if you thanks
[03:30:29] the 100 bits by the way but if you think
[03:30:31] this is a meme I crowned my Barbara like
[03:30:33] I crowned this is I I watch it
[03:30:38] who I do why is there a stream today Mr
[03:30:41] socks and then all you you'll see is

[04:12:29] is not a case for no skip button okay
[04:12:32] let dumb asses be dumb asses but let
[04:12:34] them play the game okay I would rather
[04:12:37] let someone skip dialogue than have to

[04:13:45] said okay this is a a a constitutional
[04:13:49] lawyer who uh who testifies at the
[04:13:52] Supreme Court on a on a current case
[04:13:54] okay he's he he he said and I quote I
[04:13:57] remember this he said I hate [ __ ]
[04:14:00] reading for the life of me cuz my job is
[04:14:02] reading all I do is read [ __ ] court
[04:14:04] cases so whenever I have free time I
[04:14:06] can't read drives me
[04:14:10] insane
[04:14:12] listen he has a justification for it I
[04:14:16] have one too I why if I I I don't want
[04:14:19] to read one day I could just
[04:14:21] listen I mean I do read I I just like
[04:14:24] sometimes I don't want
[04:14:28] to like if it's like a okay archon
[04:14:31] quests are like lowkey the reason no
[04:14:34] they're not the reason I got into the
[04:14:35] game but they're very like every time I
[04:14:37] do Arkham Quest I get addicted I'm like
[04:14:39] holy [ __ ] this is so good and then I
[04:14:40] have to wait like six years for the next
[04:14:42] one and then I forget everything and I'm
[04:14:43] like [ __ ] and I'm sad and then I
[04:14:45] remember AR when there there a new one
[04:14:47] I'm like oh [ __ ] I'm hype and then I do
[04:14:48] it and then after that it's like oh
[04:14:50] nothing that's literally it that's
[04:14:51] literally all it is I remember the n one
[04:14:53] beep and then you wake up like oh this
[04:14:55] is so good and then nothing after and
[04:14:57] then I have to wait like six
[04:15:03] years shower me settle down but also
[04:15:07] just because I enjoy them doesn't mean
[04:15:08] you know you have to enjoy
[04:15:12] them which is why like if my friends
[04:15:14] like yo like I wish I could skip the
[04:15:15] story I'm not going to be like no
[04:15:17] actually listen to the story it's like
[04:15:19] you know [ __ ] skip it the show that
[04:15:22] but the only yeah to relinquishing these
[04:15:25] items into your I don't think they would
[04:15:26] add it
[04:15:36] though
[04:15:39] especially story that so story that
[04:15:42] locks content is more prone for people
[04:15:45] to not care about I feel like I know
[04:15:46] like like some of the world quests you
[04:15:48] want to do to like explore with it but
[04:15:50] like for example the so like this change
[04:15:53] where you can quick
[04:15:54] start Mr sock do I I can turn the music
[04:15:57] up a
[04:15:58] little this this change where you can
[04:16:01] quick start uh I'll read the down after
[04:16:03] the strange you could quick start these
[04:16:05] TR things that you haven't done
[04:16:07] is especially nice because so let's say
[04:16:10] I know you could Co-op them in the past
[04:16:12] but anyways let's say I didn't do the
[04:16:14] Aron Quest and I need to do the weekly
[04:16:16] boss I'd be like [ __ ] this is a chore
[04:16:18] and I would spam my space bar through it
[04:16:20] and not care cuz I need the weekly boss
[04:16:22] but if but I also care about the AR
[04:16:24] Quest I want to do it but like if I have
[04:16:26] to choose between learning and missing
[04:16:28] finina mats I probably would be like
[04:16:30] okay I'm not missing the mats so it's
[04:16:32] like being able to do it whenever you
[04:16:34] want to is nice which is why whenever
[04:16:36] there's like big piece of content locked
[04:16:38] behind like some Quest it's like I get
[04:16:39] it but it's also like more people are
[04:16:41] just going to [ __ ] power through it
[04:16:43] and not care you have an entire week yes
[04:16:46] I love it when my whole week is I mean I
[04:16:49] literally okay let's say let's say okay
[04:16:52] let's say I there was no other way to
[04:16:53] get the at than do the quest I would
[04:16:56] have but I like personally I have to do
[04:16:59] finina guide Charlotte guide BYU video
[04:17:02] and then like [ __ ] whole new areas
[04:17:04] got on like it was a lot and even if I
[04:17:07] like and then you'll be like okay well
[04:17:08] what if you're not a streamer well then
[04:17:09] I don't play this game as a job so what
[04:17:11] if I had like an exam that I have to
[04:17:13] study for do I want to do an Aron Quest
[04:17:15] while I'm studying probably not like I
[04:17:17] mean I might cuz I procrastinate a
[04:17:19] lot what the [ __ ] am I doing
[04:17:25] interact hello I am I am oh it's this
[04:17:30] thing wait I remember this thing wait
[04:17:32] wait I remember this thing you did this

[04:18:17] and the thing expired
[04:18:25] so yo that was just bad timing though
[04:18:29] that was literally just bad
[04:18:31] timing wait where the [ __ ] was I where
[04:18:34] was that
[04:18:35] challenge
[04:18:37] I know I went here and then I glided
[04:18:39] somewhere I glided over

[04:19:46] what if I just go Scara and
[04:19:52] cheat no I'm not going to cheat I'm not
[04:19:54] going to cheat I'm not going to cheat
[04:19:56] losers find a way winners find an excuse
[04:19:59] no other way around losers find an
[04:20:01] excuse winners find a way I'm about to
[04:20:03] find a way
[04:20:05] watch
[04:20:22] what the [ __ ] why is that so close okay
[04:20:25] we got
[04:20:29] it wait what is that oh that's where we
[04:20:33] started uh is there anything up here
[04:20:35] that I want
[04:20:37] I'm going to land on a chest watch
[04:20:40] this
[04:20:51] watch I got a crab that's that's
[04:20:53] basically a
[04:21:03] chest
[04:21:05] [ __ ]
[04:21:19] do you not have the treasure Compass I
[04:21:21] don't even know I might maybe with this
[04:21:23] week
[04:21:26] surely this wasn't locked all right anys
[04:21:29] d
[04:21:33] it wait let me heal no
[04:21:37] oh
[04:21:42] cool should I claim my Fountain rewards
[04:21:44] it's probably max
[04:21:47] level socks I can't 36ar this Abyss
[04:21:50] sag what characters you have
[04:21:53] actually upload a screenshot of all of
[04:21:56] your characters to imer or link me your
[04:21:59] Ena or your uid I got
[04:22:05] you
[04:22:12] [ __ ]
[04:22:19] well we don't talk about
[04:22:35] it
[04:22:43] do a forar clear oh we still need to do
[04:22:45] the fourar clear you're right I do that
[04:22:47] every patch I actually didn't
[04:22:50] yet I mean but I think the I didn't want
[04:22:52] to play hyper Bloom but I think the play
[04:22:54] if we want to force dark CLE is just
[04:22:55] hyper Bloom I mean cookie not official I
[04:22:58] mean both work well we could do this
[04:22:59] actually but it's probably just
[04:23:03] this DMC counts the forest St right true
[04:23:07] you always play the same two teams no I
[04:23:10] don't I play 1618 and bet usually but
[04:23:13] now we're not playing
[04:23:15] 168 I mean 1618 might work first half
[04:23:17] but you want Hydro here so I probably
[04:23:22] wouldn't you don't AAL someone oh [ __ ]
[04:23:26] they need to focus on
[04:23:28] HP no you're probably fine
[04:23:33] wasart like okay go HP goblet like for
[04:23:36] frea go HP goblet uh but you don't need
[04:23:39] to like you have her signature too you
[04:23:41] don't need to just go HP on everything
[04:23:44] but HP Sands could be good if you have
[04:23:46] enough
[04:23:57] ER it's a bit intense for me right
[04:24:04] now think of double Anya with finina
[04:24:06] official wait who's your healer
[04:24:09] Jean
[04:24:12] um I don't think i' have I tried that
[04:24:14] team what is it this this
[04:24:20] Jean and then like Scara no not Scara
[04:24:23] like
[04:24:27] sucros
[04:24:32] uh I mean I'm not the big I mean it fits
[04:24:36] probably
[04:24:37] fine but at that point why don't you do
[04:24:40] like at that point I'd rather have a
[04:24:43] different Drive I
[04:24:47] mean I just don't see the point of
[04:24:49] double anymo like sugas gives you Em
[04:24:51] which is nice but normally I would just
[04:24:52] do
[04:24:54] like I
[04:24:56] mean I would have an on Fielder here
[04:24:58] like an actual on
[04:25:00] Fielder [ __ ] it never
[04:25:03] let but I mean it's probably fine it's
[04:25:06] probably genuinely a fine
[04:25:08] team I I don't know if I would
[04:25:11] replace
[04:25:15] yeah that point just play
[04:25:17] Nita yeah you could well if you're n you
[04:25:21] could do a dendro and then sucros can
[04:25:23] swirl the electro to hyper Bloom you
[04:25:24] don't really want Nikita without like
[04:25:26] with fishal as your only Electro and no
[04:25:28] sucros but you could do Nita you could
[04:25:30] do uh sucros and then another dendro
[04:25:35] character
[04:25:39] but you'd want a
[04:25:40] Healer so it would have to be like BYU
[04:25:42] but BYU's d drop is not that
[04:25:45] great anyways I want to do are we going
[04:25:48] to do a four star clear what would our
[04:25:49] first half be probably [ __ ]
[04:25:50] strangling if we're being honest but we
[04:25:52] need
[04:25:56] Hydro like Shang Ling
[04:26:05] Bennett there's not enough fourar
[04:26:10] Hydra literally SRO
[04:26:19] Barbara Candice true could play
[04:26:26] Candace Fino would be cracked
[04:26:35] here
[04:26:36] bet official can destroy the shield
[04:26:38] actually can you actually break the
[04:26:41] fatherless Flames with just double
[04:26:43] Electro is it consistent I should
[04:26:45] probably try
[04:26:46] it cuz you can overload spam I know that
[04:26:49] but I guess beta would bounce on dude
[04:26:51] beta is so
[04:26:54] broken zff almost died of cringe playing
[04:26:57] beta official team yeah but zff always
[04:26:59] dies of
[04:27:04] cringe
[04:27:09] do we just quick
[04:27:11] in
[04:27:14] good good
[04:27:24] try can try
[04:27:28] it or we could taser wait is is my
[04:27:32] character's geared offishal stringless
[04:27:35] golden only two piece golden but it is
[04:27:37] what it is
[04:27:39] uh yep we're not playing Kaa bet is
[04:27:43] probably on aquilis
[04:27:48] favonius
[04:27:52] oops what the I
[04:27:55] forgot no I mean okay uh do I want to
[04:27:59] reggear them I
[04:28:03] can
[04:28:04] [ __ ]
[04:28:14] check yoia please what's the
[04:28:17] weapon range
[04:28:19] gauge this is really good though for a
[04:28:22] rust ratio we're also not even fully
[04:28:24] ascended well you probably want more
[04:28:26] crit damage never
[04:28:30] mind there you
[04:28:34] go range
[04:28:36] Gage uh so our we need to play kakomi
[04:28:43] fan we could give her our leveled F
[04:28:46] sword and then we also need to
[04:28:49] play ya oh
[04:28:52] yo why
[04:29:04] is [ __ ]
[04:29:14] it I think this is
[04:29:18] fine is there a nocturnal team I feel
[04:29:20] like we need a team that's National but
[04:29:23] nocturnal who's an edgy character no
[04:29:29] but
[04:29:30] Rosaria works at night so Rosaria would
[04:29:33] be nocturnal true
[04:29:39] okay we can try this I don't know if
[04:29:41] this will work though we might have to
[04:29:43] give
[04:29:45] up we'll see second half we play hyper
[04:29:49] blue wow I love hyper
[04:29:52] Bloom who's our hyper blo
[04:30:02] driver
[04:30:04] me
[04:30:12] cave we got actually cave I'm not even
[04:30:30] kidding I mean wait we're not playing
[04:30:32] Shang
[04:30:34] l
[04:30:48] my I don't know if my K's geared but I'm
[04:30:50] not going to just send it Ka probably
[04:30:51] does enough just by being
[04:30:57] there dude where is Kaa oh he's level 90
[04:31:01] what the [ __ ] I Ed my
[04:31:04] Kaa
[04:31:10] this probably
[04:31:12] works although National I usually don't
[04:31:15] play like just full single Target but C6
[04:31:18] Lynette could pop off there true I don't
[04:31:20] think I have C6 but lyette could work
[04:31:24] actually no dendro a Simon oh yeah there
[04:31:27] is a Simon yeah I think Nationals made
[04:31:30] for the first
[04:31:32] team I mean realistically we could
[04:31:34] probably swap these team comps and then
[04:31:35] just bench Bo cuz it's single Target
[04:31:37] second half I don't know who we'd play
[04:31:39] instead of bet though if we do
[04:31:41] that probably
[04:31:47] um yeah there's not really I mean Kookie
[04:31:52] maybe but I don't really like aggravate
[04:31:54] cookie as much as I like uh hyper Bloom
[04:32:04] cookie we can also just not play Shang
[04:32:07] Ling and just hyper Bloom
[04:32:20] second so what would this be it would be
[04:32:22] Shang Ling
[04:32:26] Bennett srol and then second half would
[04:32:29] be
[04:32:32] offishal
[04:32:34] sucrose
[04:32:36] yo
[04:32:43] Yao I
[04:32:45] mean we could technically
[04:32:49] Barbara and then bench this and do
[04:32:53] Kookie like but then our d op's low I
[04:32:58] mean could do like
[04:33:01] this it's kind of cope though I don't
[04:33:03] really like that all DMC over kurara
[04:33:08] but triple healer
[04:33:11] yeah like I'm sure would I'm sure it
[04:33:14] would work but it's kind of
[04:33:20] copium try my team out what the [ __ ] is
[04:33:23] your team Bart I did Lisa aggravate and
[04:33:26] National with jzo I mean Lisa aggravate
[04:33:28] is not bad I actually think Lisa's like
[04:33:30] underrated for that stuff but I don't
[04:33:32] know if I want
[04:33:34] to I mean we could we could play this
[04:33:37] first half we'll put Ka so the Kaia
[04:33:39] lovers stay in chat
[04:33:41] um and second half we could do a Lisa
[04:33:44] team we could do
[04:33:51] Lisa Leisa is 90 right yeah we could do
[04:33:54] Lisa
[04:33:55] fishal Yao squared and sucros but Lisa
[04:33:59] off field is not as
[04:34:02] good so sucros here is kind of weird
[04:34:19] okay we could try it let me make sure at
[04:34:21] least is the only character that's not
[04:34:22] geared though so we have to gear
[04:34:25] her
[04:34:28] [ __ ] I'll give her
[04:34:31] whth and uh probably for TF is is her
[04:34:35] best on field but I don't I think our
[04:34:38] sucros is on
[04:34:39] Fielding I mean we could also swap
[04:34:42] between the
[04:34:54] two could also give her emblem but I
[04:34:56] think we'll
[04:34:58] do yeah we'll do
[04:35:04] gilded
[04:35:09] no am I really going to take all of my y
[04:35:11] pieces no way right no way bra wait why
[04:35:14] is this on diona give me that n n n n
[04:35:29] n do I have a gilded Electro goblet I
[04:35:31] think I have one with 13 crit rate
[04:35:33] correct me if I'm wrong correct me why
[04:35:34] do I have an em goblet on my y Miko why
[04:35:37] is that on
[04:35:46] her stop typing first time chatter every
[04:35:50] time someone's first message is Flaming
[04:35:52] me that doesn't make them a Chad it does
[04:35:55] not you aren't a Chad for flaming me
[04:35:58] that does not make you a
[04:36:01] Chad no it doesn't no it doesn't
[04:36:08] I could use solar Pearl but remind me to
[04:36:09] Auto attack before I burst but yeah
[04:36:12] let's just do
[04:36:22] this the [ __ ] is
[04:36:34] this
[04:36:43] I don't want to steal a ey piece but
[04:36:45] wait is it's kind of low ER but we're
[04:36:47] playing quickin and we have official
[04:36:49] we're ah if we on field a bit I'm sure
[04:36:51] it's fine I'm sure I'm sure it's fine
[04:36:54] quick and with visual I'm sure it's
[04:37:02] fine we'll maybe boost it up a little
[04:37:06] actually let's try
[04:37:10] it okay I think we're good fishal is
[04:37:13] geared I think everyone's geared I what
[04:37:16] my Su universe and founded Paradise for
[04:37:23] IAL could also throwing
[04:37:27] Tails I'm going to throwing
[04:37:34] tails
[04:37:40] bro I just went out got back and you're
[04:37:42] still
[04:37:43] gearing you're cool you're funny okay
[04:37:47] we're playing FAL no we're playing
[04:37:51] sucros do I want to start on my thr
[04:37:53] Tales user maybe
[04:37:55] not but don't care Plus didn't ask and
[04:37:58] also ratio yao yao should be on
[04:38:03] instructor but she's on emblem and I
[04:38:06] don't know if I want to okay emblem's
[04:38:08] kind of funny I think emblem ya Yao is

[05:07:36] team second hindsight one probably not K
[05:07:39] first team hindsight 2 second team was
[05:07:41] good but hyper balloon probably would
[05:07:43] have been better hindsight three uh our
[05:07:46] Bennett had absolutely no artifacts so
[05:07:49] he should have been on instructor or no
[05:07:50] blast hindsight 4 our ya Yao was
[05:07:54] definitely not supposed to be on
[05:07:58] emblem but we did it with fourstar
[05:08:00] characters pogers
[05:08:06] [Music]
[05:08:07] I actually had the try hard that was fun
[05:08:09] I wish I mean I know that's like as but
[05:08:11] like doing it was not fun but in
[05:08:14] hindsight like damn I wish I had to try
[05:08:16] that hard every
[05:08:19] Abyss how are you hyper bloom forar only
[05:08:21] without Singo
[05:08:24] legit sing Cho and then just first half
[05:08:26] [ __ ] it or Barbara I mean it doesn't
[05:08:29] really matter if you don't have sing tro
[05:08:31] right can you just Barbara
[05:08:32] can you just Barbara DMC another and
[05:08:35] then Kookie but then your only damage is
[05:08:37] Kookie Candice yeah I guess Candace
[05:08:40] Works do you have C6 Candace though C6
[05:08:43] makes her a lot
[05:08:45] better taser the the thing is I don't
[05:08:50] like taser without bet but if you're
[05:08:52] talking about first half you could
[05:08:54] Barbara B
[05:08:58] official you could Barbara bet

[05:09:39] you will if you're at floor 12 and you
[05:09:41] have no Hydro five stars that's either
[05:09:43] very unlucky or you just don't like
[05:09:45] Hydro characters which is fair but
[05:09:47] usually you have one at least even if
[05:09:49] it's Mona like Mona's
