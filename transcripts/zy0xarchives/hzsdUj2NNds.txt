[00:07:30] welcome oh I have butao true
[00:07:37] it just died hello Fang
[00:07:40] oh there's a new code in chat redeem it
[00:07:42] I'm gonna forget to redeem it I wonder
[00:07:45] how many how many gems do you think I've
[00:07:46] lost in both gencha and starrell from
[00:07:48] just not redeeming codes or forgetting
[00:07:49] to probably like probably like
[00:07:52] dude do you know how many live stream
[00:07:54] okay well I don't think about it
[00:07:58] uh let me play some form of music and
[00:08:00] then we're gonna play stereo
[00:08:05] yes
[00:08:18] boom
[00:08:20] wait I don't know what I can look I
[00:08:21] don't know if it's I haven't streamed
[00:08:22] Starlet in a long time
[00:08:24] I've been playing it off stream but I
[00:08:25] haven't been streaming it so I don't
[00:08:26] know if my setup looks
[00:08:28] like it should I need to be centered
[00:08:30] boom all right
[00:08:35] how long is the code valid for I don't
[00:08:37] know but usually they're not allowed a
[00:08:38] lot of the redeem it as soon as you can
[00:08:39] okay woof walk time
[00:08:42] okay so I basically chucked my Dan hung
[00:08:44] ill pieces on my Clara so my Clara why'd
[00:08:48] I say Cara hook uh my hook has on the
[00:08:50] fall of an aeon we're gonna superimpose
[00:08:51] this I need to do simulated Universe
[00:08:53] this week to claim the superimposers and
[00:08:54] I'll have three or two I'll be S3
[00:08:58] uh uh uh uh uh okay okay look I I rolled
[00:09:02] okay I before I show you guys what I'm
[00:09:04] on
[00:09:05] I rolled off stream and I got some
[00:09:07] insane [ __ ] relics I even
[00:09:08] screenshotted it which proves that you
[00:09:09] guys are the problem not me because I
[00:09:11] rolled off stream the only thing I don't
[00:09:13] want to talk about is my boot is
[00:09:16] I don't want to talk about my boots I
[00:09:18] can go and offset one and it would
[00:09:20] probably be more efficient to go like
[00:09:21] offset like this but I don't want to do
[00:09:23] that because it looks ugly so please
[00:09:25] shut the [ __ ] up uh but look so this is
[00:09:28] what I rolled off straight so I got this
[00:09:30] literally today this didn't even have
[00:09:33] crit damage it only had three sub stats
[00:09:34] I said you know what
[00:09:36] let's see where it goes and where it
[00:09:38] went is a nice place uh of pretty much
[00:09:41] perfect stats the only downside is it
[00:09:43] missed it like one it didn't have four
[00:09:45] stuff that's but who cares
[00:09:48] what up Drew dude
[00:09:49] and Dish hello
[00:09:52] anyway it's really good then I also
[00:09:54] rolled this today
[00:09:55] but I also only have these for boots so
[00:09:58] we don't talk about it but I did roll
[00:09:59] this today as well
[00:10:00] um last time I rolled I got multiple
[00:10:02] like okay I've been every single day I
[00:10:04] was gone I was in New York for like four
[00:10:06] four days and then when I was playing
[00:10:07] kitchen I would just Auto Battle like
[00:10:09] Relic domain so it's like I've been
[00:10:10] farming a lot it's just a lot of the bad
[00:10:12] ones I throw away
[00:10:13] I think I threw my other one anyways
[00:10:15] yeah so I have this
[00:10:17] and I have this
[00:10:18] that I just got this one's pretty good
[00:10:20] as well but it's my yanching one I'm
[00:10:22] cheating this belongs to Yan Ching so I
[00:10:24] am sorry Mr yanching
[00:10:27] but we are borrowing it
[00:10:31] These Boots are disgusting they're
[00:10:32] actually so bad that going an offset
[00:10:34] boot is probably better because more
[00:10:35] speed uh and we'll make up for the like
[00:10:37] the 16th damage but I don't want to do
[00:10:39] that because I think it's kind of cringe
[00:10:40] so we'll see what we can do uh our ball
[00:10:42] is really good it's on the wrong set but
[00:10:44] inner it's okay uh if you don't know for
[00:10:47] Mr ill rudolin arena is better
[00:10:50] but it's fine
[00:10:52] it's fine
[00:10:53] and then a rope we're gonna this is the
[00:10:55] one we're gonna use we're actually gonna
[00:10:56] join Garcia's rope
[00:10:58] um because I am mean like that
[00:11:00] but hopefully we do get uh the the set
[00:11:03] the rudolent arena
[00:11:05] so I want
[00:11:08] Story of My Life sorry sorry
[00:11:15] why speed boots because if your whole
[00:11:17] team is fast then you are way more
[00:11:20] efficient than if your whole team is
[00:11:21] slow and
[00:11:23] a common misconception well it's not
[00:11:26] common yet because he's not out until
[00:11:27] now and now he's out but something
[00:11:29] that's going to be a misconception in
[00:11:30] literally a day once people start
[00:11:32] playing him is wow my dad hung ill is
[00:11:35] fast I have no skill points don't build
[00:11:37] speed on him which is cringe don't do
[00:11:39] that build speed on him but build more
[00:11:41] speed on your supports because then your
[00:11:42] support every your whole team is fast so
[00:11:44] you can go twice per cycle but your
[00:11:45] supports are also fast so you can still
[00:11:47] generate the skill points true
[00:11:49] or you could do a full slow team if you
[00:11:51] just don't care but like it's not as
[00:11:53] good
[00:12:00] all right is he out
[00:12:10] sniffer
[00:12:14] dude look at him
[00:12:19] dude look at him he's so beautiful he is
[00:12:22] so beautiful he's so Majestic
[00:12:27] Banner yukong Asta March oh if you're
[00:12:30] wondering ask
[00:12:31] okay I think I think Asta is still to
[00:12:34] this day the one of the probably the
[00:12:36] most criminally underrated character I
[00:12:37] think ass is really good even with like
[00:12:39] okay with that how ill do you wanting
[00:12:40] Yoon but like the second like another
[00:12:43] like fine option is pretty [ __ ] good
[00:12:46] if you have her E6 E4 and E6 are really
[00:12:48] good and then mashing [ __ ] is also good
[00:12:53] anyways I want to pull from dude look at
[00:12:55] him
[00:12:57] dude dude I'm gonna okay I wanna try
[00:12:59] something with King Yoon today okay I
[00:13:01] fell down we're gonna talk about that
[00:13:03] hot girl once I pull from but I've went
[00:13:05] into like a deep deep TC Rabbit Hole of
[00:13:09] his rotation depending on your team and
[00:13:12] it has [ __ ] with me for like
[00:13:14] hours but basically
[00:13:17] we're I'm pretty sure we're chilling I
[00:13:19] just need to the one thing I need to do
[00:13:21] is um
[00:13:22] we need to put our Ting Yoon on the
[00:13:24] [ __ ] energy build
[00:13:26] which means mashing [ __ ]
[00:13:29] um [ __ ]
[00:13:31] 15 erro minus 12 right now and also uh
[00:13:35] what's the other set called Von dwac who
[00:13:37] the [ __ ] it is I don't know so we're
[00:13:39] gonna have to do that
[00:13:43] because other people can test it as well
[00:13:45] but I want to test it myself that my
[00:13:47] theory is Dan hung ill should be able to
[00:13:49] alt every three turns with the Ting Yoon
[00:13:51] even if she's not E6
[00:13:53] but I need to make sure that's true
[00:13:57] so yeah anyways we're gonna warp we're
[00:14:00] gonna uh do that right now
[00:14:03] and then we're gonna level him
[00:14:05] um chat is it wait let me check is the
[00:14:07] new boss out
[00:14:11] I mean it has to be but like can I do I
[00:14:13] need to do a [ __ ] archon Quest
[00:14:16] stagnant Shadow oh it's right I love you
[00:14:19] thank you whoever did this thank you
[00:14:24] I will say and this is oh wait my games
[00:14:26] are yeah this is how you guys know I've
[00:14:28] been playing this game in the background
[00:14:29] this [ __ ] is muted as [ __ ]
[00:14:32] wait what's the normal sound for me wait
[00:14:33] let's see
[00:14:35] why do I still not hear him hello hello
[00:14:39] is he okay
[00:14:42] he's playing we are booge
[00:14:45] wait is it
[00:14:47] is this what maybe I'm using like voice
[00:14:51] oh wait let me check maybe I've muted it
[00:14:53] like locally
[00:14:58] wait what why the [ __ ] it no volume
[00:15:02] I don't think my volume mixer hasn't
[00:15:03] muted
[00:15:04] um
[00:15:15] I used voice meter for a bit and then I
[00:15:16] uninstalled it maybe it [ __ ] with my
[00:15:21] GameStops
[00:15:26] hello Jeff
[00:15:47] I need to reinstall them out
[00:15:49] give me a second
[00:16:01] because I think I muted it on your
[00:16:02] trumpet which I used to use to split my
[00:16:04] stream audio but now I don't use that
[00:16:05] anymore so I think I have to reinstall
[00:16:06] it to re-unmute it and then re-install
[00:16:09] it
[00:16:12] gearing volume Ain't No Way shut the
[00:16:15] [ __ ] up it's gonna take like two seconds
[00:16:20] it's not loading
[00:16:25] how are you in and I still have
[00:16:26] maintenance oh did you try getting
[00:16:27] better that's actually a it's a common
[00:16:29] it's a common mistake just try to it's
[00:16:31] it's an issue of skill if I were to be
[00:16:33] uh if I were to be honest
[00:16:39] oh I have it up in I have it open please
[00:16:40] please please
[00:16:47] oh yeah that's why okay I switched the
[00:16:49] audience okay this might destroy your
[00:16:51] ears give me a second I figured it out
[00:16:52] so we'll move with your character for
[00:16:54] the abilities duration
[00:16:57] okay cool
[00:17:00] oh yeah I had to reinstall why do I have
[00:17:02] to reinstall it reinstall an app that I
[00:17:05] uninstalled just to fix it that makes no
[00:17:07] sense
[00:17:08] is this finder still too loud it's still
[00:17:10] a little bit loud dude why did the dude
[00:17:12] he literally Jiggles his torso
[00:17:22] are you pulling for ill's lycon okay
[00:17:24] here is why I don't want to pull for it
[00:17:26] I might I might but the reason why I
[00:17:28] don't want to do it now is because I as
[00:17:30] I said I fell down the rabbit hole of
[00:17:33] tcing his rotations to a stupid [ __ ]
[00:17:35] degree where I literally am upset
[00:17:39] and this what gives him energy on his it
[00:17:42] gives him more energy okay this icon
[00:17:44] gives him more energy and the problem
[00:17:46] with this is I'm pretty sure I can three
[00:17:48] alt like three turn alt without needing
[00:17:51] it but if I get it then I won't know if
[00:17:54] it's because of the icon or not so I'm
[00:17:55] not going to use the icon we might pull
[00:17:57] for it later I might get it but I'm not
[00:17:59] gonna use it until I figure out if I can
[00:18:01] three turn all to them
[00:18:04] because yeah
[00:18:06] I don't know how to explain it it's just
[00:18:07] it's I don't I just don't want it we
[00:18:10] have nine
[00:18:11] wait what if I do a temple here dude
[00:18:13] it's literally I have nine for free and
[00:18:14] I'll get ten dude I'll get 10 when I get
[00:18:16] them okay true ready let me turn my
[00:18:18] music down
[00:18:20] pull and don't use it okay I'm not a
[00:18:22] whale do you think I'm just here For
[00:18:24] Your Entertainment I'll do whatever you
[00:18:26] say
[00:18:27] oh Chad told me so I'll do it
[00:18:31] what pity are you on oh yeah uh I don't
[00:18:35] pull off stream like I pull for a
[00:18:38] character then I stop so our last record
[00:18:40] is probably gonna be yeah oh well we did
[00:18:42] pull for Luca actually when did we get
[00:18:44] Kafka okay
[00:18:46] yeah it's our we're we're like we're
[00:18:48] very far 50 50.
[00:18:54] look at the character in menu and move
[00:18:56] the camera they follow you what
[00:19:01] what the [ __ ]
[00:19:03] hey
[00:19:27] anyways
[00:19:28] let's pull
[00:19:29] try King Yoon shut the [ __ ] up shut the
[00:19:32] [ __ ] up dude yeah actually you're
[00:19:34] actually gonna give me nightmares no no
[00:19:36] no we're not doing that okay let's pull
[00:19:38] temple temple temple temple all right
[00:19:40] Temple
[00:19:42] first temple 50 50.
[00:19:46] are there any of the four stars I want
[00:19:50] I have a very nice
[00:19:52] um so we do want Asta like uh Islands

[00:20:11] are you asking
[00:20:14] are we talking uh
[00:20:17] I'm not even gonna
[00:20:20] I mean
[00:20:24] wasn't there a banner where I got like
[00:20:25] eight Servals why am I always getting
[00:20:26] Servals can jump higher than the average
[00:20:28] building this is because buildings can't
[00:20:31] jump pause up no unlucky
[00:20:35] okay that's only 24s though only 20
[00:20:38] pulls well technically 30 because we
[00:20:39] didn't actually Temple after Kafka
[00:20:47] okay okay oh I'm also gonna have to
[00:20:50] level a meshing [ __ ] which is
[00:20:51] unfortunate because I should have had it
[00:20:53] leveled before the stream started but I
[00:20:56] did oh that's good yukon's good well we
[00:20:59] want more Islands on her cool
[00:21:02] yeah nice
[00:21:04] another 10 ball this is the fourth
[00:21:07] temple
[00:21:09] unlucky
[00:21:11] well Third Temple of this Banner but
[00:21:13] we're at 40 pity
[00:21:21] if we get bailu I will ban at least 10
[00:21:24] Chatters no mercy
[00:21:27] oh that's good I like this icon very
[00:21:29] strong
[00:21:31] good
[00:21:34] that was a good Temple
[00:21:38] that was a good Temple
[00:21:42] okay one more why is there a Gamble and
[00:21:44] if I'm gonna win the 50 50 or not dude
[00:21:46] [ __ ] all of you

[00:23:41] let's not talk about the past but

[00:23:49] that was a Four Star by the way okay
[00:23:56] okay cornopica

[00:24:17] something we'll get okay good it's fine
[00:24:19] sir
[00:24:26] oh my God sorry I'm focused
[00:24:31] that's good that's good that's probably
[00:24:34] at least E5
[00:24:36] maybe E6
[00:24:37] Asta into
[00:24:41] imbibator lunae
[00:24:43] boom [ __ ]
[00:24:54] dude everything I click it's like
[00:24:57] I'm like stressed what the [ __ ] is Data
[00:24:59] Bank
[00:25:00] oh wait there's a drop
[00:25:06] dude it's not only that oh we won the
[00:25:09] 5050 I'm happy it took a long time I run
[00:25:10] 50 50. dude look at him he even has a
[00:25:12] maple leaf because he visited Canada to
[00:25:14] come see me so I gave him a souvenir
[00:25:16] it's no big deal it's no big deal he
[00:25:18] actually like forgot some things here so
[00:25:19] he'll be back later but it's let me go
[00:25:22] let's [ __ ] go
[00:25:27] his waist what about it
[00:25:30] what about it
[00:25:33] dude he's so [ __ ] sick
[00:25:36] I'm actually very hyped
[00:25:41] yummy
[00:25:43] I still don't get how he's imaginary and
[00:25:45] not oh my how many you asked us okay
[00:25:48] that has to be E6 right that has to be
[00:25:51] E6
[00:25:56] sorry I got distracted that has to be E6
[00:25:58] that actually has to be where's Aston
[00:26:00] where's Asta
[00:26:04] oh it is
[00:26:07] uh I don't know if I'll use it now but
[00:26:12] this means we have a really good up time
[00:26:14] on our attack buff
[00:26:15] which uh can be very nice
[00:26:21] yep okay cool uh and a speed buff also
[00:26:25] because of the energy but yeah okay okay
[00:26:27] so so so so so let's level Mr ill
[00:26:36] why is he shorter than blade
[00:26:39] I mean blade is like the show of star
[00:26:41] rails so it makes sense I guess but
[00:26:48] all right so I fully leveled on the fall
[00:26:50] of an aeon just for him I also leveled
[00:26:53] relics uh I pre-farmed some mats okay I
[00:26:56] don't have a lot of these because listen
[00:26:58] I don't kill enemies I just Auto it's
[00:27:01] fine we'll convert we're chilling but I
[00:27:03] did actually perform a lot uh if I could
[00:27:05] show you guys how many purples I have
[00:27:06] that's 57 which is quite a decent amount
[00:27:08] on top of what I prefarmed for the
[00:27:09] weapon so I actually do have a lot so
[00:27:12] don't worry
[00:27:13] we can actually play them
[00:27:15] uh relics I basically
[00:27:19] gave everything the hook that he's gonna
[00:27:21] use out of curiosity I wonder what the
[00:27:24] game will give him if I click on
[00:27:25] recommended gear
[00:27:27] why is this all plus zero okay this is
[00:27:28] actually a good set though wait this is
[00:27:30] actually like low-key optimal this is
[00:27:32] like actually good but why does it plus
[00:27:33] zero
[00:27:34] wait what about main stats defense
[00:27:38] well at least the set's good
[00:27:46] um okay this is a good piece this one's
[00:27:48] okay this one I mean at least it's crit
[00:27:51] this one is [ __ ] terrible uh and then
[00:27:53] this is good and this is good so well no
[00:27:55] crit but actually not even bad
[00:27:57] okay anyways what we have is the
[00:27:59] following so I want to go either
[00:28:00] musketeer of the wild wheat four piece
[00:28:02] or uh the imaginary set the probably the
[00:28:06] imaginary set is it's kind of
[00:28:07] inconsistent it's like conditional but
[00:28:09] if you're playing Pila you can have like
[00:28:10] 100 debuff up time if you're using
[00:28:12] the silver wolf icon which we got uh two
[00:28:15] patches ago
[00:28:16] so you're at least getting 20 value and
[00:28:19] 10 imaginary damage which is a lot even
[00:28:21] if you're not getting the imprisoned
[00:28:22] crit damage so like it is more
[00:28:24] consistent than people make it out to be
[00:28:25] but this is like the generic like easy
[00:28:28] set that everyone has so it's probably
[00:28:29] what we're gonna use uh but since I I
[00:28:32] don't have a good four piece of either I
[00:28:33] have a good two piece two piece
[00:28:36] so that's what we're gonna do I rolled
[00:28:38] this off stream and I rolled this off
[00:28:39] stream
[00:28:40] and then I also rolled the uh our ball
[00:28:42] now as I said earlier
[00:28:45] rudolin arena is better than salsodo but
[00:28:47] I don't have a good rule in Arena so
[00:28:48] suck my salsodo that didn't make sense
[00:28:50] I'm sorry
[00:28:52] I hid my desk and my boo towel lit up
[00:28:54] brother
[00:28:58] uh we're gonna take this I'm gonna give
[00:29:00] this to Celie because we're gonna borrow
[00:29:01] her piece I'm sorry silly
[00:29:04] um
[00:29:07] we got criterated from our traces we
[00:29:09] need speed boots unfortunately my only
[00:29:12] good speed boots are
[00:29:16] I don't want to talk about it let's
[00:29:17] filter by speed let's filter by speed
[00:29:19] I don't want to talk about my speed
[00:29:20] boost right now okay like my best option
[00:29:23] is to go offset because if I go on set I
[00:29:26] literally
[00:29:33] I don't want to talk about it
[00:29:38] I mean this is still better than a four
[00:29:40] star but we have a first
[00:29:43] okay let me
[00:29:46] where we simply
[00:29:51] syntheticans we're gonna synthesize some
[00:29:52] boots really fast let's go to salvage
[00:29:54] and then we're gonna click on this
[00:29:57] let's just make some booze really fast
[00:29:58] let's make some boots really fast this
[00:29:59] won't take long not long at all this
[00:30:01] could be good we'll keep it uh this
[00:30:03] really won't take long shot this won't
[00:30:05] take long
[00:30:08] this is good no
[00:30:11] oh also also I have I did the event you
[00:30:14] know the [ __ ] the last event that
[00:30:15] like mining one that took literally 60
[00:30:17] the excavation that took 54 [ __ ]
[00:30:20] years it was It was kind of fun but it
[00:30:22] took [ __ ] forever I did all of it I
[00:30:24] literally did all of it I am not even
[00:30:27] kidding I did all of it
[00:30:30] so we have I can
[00:30:32] um force create something
[00:30:36] why did they say gearing by okay dude
[00:30:38] not you too it literally doesn't even
[00:30:41] take a lot we're literally gear look
[00:30:42] look I click on feet I go boom we get
[00:30:45] speed it's done I'm done I'm literally
[00:30:46] done
[00:30:47] boom I'm literally done
[00:30:51] that's still better than our four star
[00:30:52] we can use that
[00:30:54] the one thing I wanted to force oh man I
[00:30:57] should do this okay I'm [ __ ] it I don't
[00:30:59] care
[00:31:01] yeah
[00:31:03] I need to try this I need to try this I
[00:31:05] don't even want to do this but I need to
[00:31:06] try it
[00:31:10] okay oh attack good routine
[00:31:17] like I don't want to use a set but it
[00:31:20] that it's like kind of optimal for ting
[00:31:21] Yoon sometimes so we're gonna do it
[00:31:24] um
[00:31:32] but it's only minus one resin it's
[00:31:34] that's not resin okay I'm not even gonna
[00:31:36] read chat I'm just gonna level this
[00:31:38] we're just gonna level this we're gonna
[00:31:40] do this
[00:31:41] we're gonna go to our four-star piece
[00:31:42] where the [ __ ] is it
[00:31:46] did I not unlock it
[00:31:48] or is it still on dude where is my boot
[00:31:51] oh I still have it on sorry sorry my bad
[00:32:00] plus eleven no big deal we got a crit
[00:32:02] rate roll okay all right
[00:32:04] wow
[00:32:06] okay at least I got a crittery roll it's
[00:32:08] already better than a four-star piece so
[00:32:09] it's all good
[00:32:19] boom
[00:32:21] all right our boots are oh actually good
[00:32:23] okay I think it's not amazing but it's
[00:32:25] usable boom so now we're dead hung ill
[00:32:27] we are gaining how much to trade from
[00:32:29] traces let me check it is 5.3 plus 4.0
[00:32:33] so 9.3 plus there's another one here 2.7
[00:32:36] so 12. uh crit rate is what we're
[00:32:39] gaining 64 plus 12 is 76 plus 0.8 so
[00:32:44] 76.8 158.8 pretty good ratio on a
[00:32:48] non-crit weapon uh which is also his
[00:32:50] free to play best slot and if you can
[00:32:52] superimpose it for free it's almost
[00:32:54] asbestos thought it's not his icon is
[00:32:55] better but not by that much so pretty
[00:32:58] [ __ ] cracked well I can superimpose
[00:33:00] it once but twice once I do this thing
[00:33:01] but it is what it is shut up we'll get
[00:33:04] better later
[00:33:08] what if I gain no no we're not doing
[00:33:10] that
[00:33:13] okay we're gonna go do
[00:33:15] okay
[00:33:16] all right
[00:33:20] profile pictures
[00:33:22] is it gonna be that hung ill it probably
[00:33:24] will be where is it where the [ __ ] is it
[00:33:26] I don't wanna I'm not gonna buy it I'm
[00:33:28] not gonna buy it I just wanna see what
[00:33:29] it looks like I'm not gonna buy it
[00:33:30] though
[00:33:31] wait what
[00:33:35] I mean he's in like a row but
[00:33:39] where's the pivoter
[00:33:43] I mean she's cute
[00:33:46] oh well
[00:33:48] Chad does you remember to claim HSR
[00:33:50] BattleBots dude I forgot to claim my
[00:33:52] gentian level 50 Battle pass last time
[00:33:54] star rail I fully claimed it two days
[00:33:56] ago I fully I got everything it was all
[00:33:58] hoodie I got everything
[00:34:00] that's why that's literally the only
[00:34:02] reason why I could level my lycone
[00:34:04] because it gave me so much uh XP
[00:34:09] all right let's uh Ascend our uh Mr ill
[00:34:12] so we're gonna go do let me make a team
[00:34:14] from
[00:34:16] adox I claimed it three weeks ago
[00:34:19] [ __ ] you
[00:34:21] sorry I'm sorry that was uncalled for
[00:34:23] okay so 99 of players this is the team
[00:34:26] you're gonna play
[00:34:30] you're welcome now here's here's a wait
[00:34:32] my mouse just died
[00:34:34] okay I need to plug my mouse in whatever
[00:34:37] at least this game isn't hard
[00:34:43] Yukon also work yes but she's weird
[00:34:45] because her buff doesn't last for like
[00:34:47] you okay Yukon is a lot more skill point
[00:34:50] fiendy so she'll eat all your skill
[00:34:52] points while you're sleeping but you can
[00:34:55] like use your skill once every two turns
[00:34:56] and like it's it's fine you do need to
[00:34:59] speed tune with her it's just she eats
[00:35:00] your skill points a lot uh E6 helps yeah
[00:35:03] with Yukon
[00:35:04] I don't like playing her but I recognize
[00:35:07] that she's fine you can also use a mono
[00:35:09] imaginary team you could do this where
[00:35:12] is he you could do this
[00:35:14] and then either her or welt and then
[00:35:16] luocha and then silver wolf time for a
[00:35:19] bug
[00:35:21] but yeah and then you're like okay also
[00:35:23] for your healer on that hung ill okay
[00:35:25] here's the thing you need to know for
[00:35:26] healer you either have little and you're
[00:35:28] [ __ ] chilling or dripart and you're
[00:35:30] also chilling because he Shields you
[00:35:31] with his alt you don't really need to
[00:35:33] skill you're chilling
[00:35:34] or you're crying so it's either luocha
[00:35:37] japard or you're crying if you're crying
[00:35:40] it's fine you can use Natasha you can
[00:35:41] use bailu you can use [ __ ] fire emcee
[00:35:44] if you're weird I don't really see the
[00:35:45] point of running her like yeah she can
[00:35:47] give you a shield without skill pointing
[00:35:48] but it's like it's kind of not hard and
[00:35:50] then memory chaos they're gonna [ __ ]
[00:35:51] destroy your anus so I kind of recommend
[00:35:53] a Healer more but anyways uh uh yeah
[00:35:56] yeah or Japan or you're crying it's fine
[00:35:58] if you're using another healer it's just
[00:36:00] you kind of you'll have to do uh a two
[00:36:03] charge normal a level two normal on him
[00:36:05] instead of a level three
[00:36:06] base not all the time but your rotation
[00:36:09] will probably be uh
[00:36:11] uh like level two level two level two
[00:36:13] and then level three unless you can
[00:36:14] alter read three turns and it'll be like
[00:36:15] three either three three two or three
[00:36:18] two two it doesn't matter okay so this
[00:36:19] is our team we're gonna play it uh I
[00:36:21] might use silver wolf because she's
[00:36:22] higher level no she's not they're both
[00:36:24] level 70. but she's geared better
[00:36:26] anyways
[00:36:32] drop hard
[00:36:34] don't talk to me or my son ever again
[00:36:41] I thought that was destructible
[00:36:46] what does he have boob window why not
[00:36:49] foreign
[00:36:59] you're a leaping dragon
[00:37:02] wow
[00:37:04] I'm pretty sure it okay I need to try it
[00:37:06] against enemies but I'm pretty sure it
[00:37:07] makes you not get um
[00:37:09] like they won't Ambush you and you
[00:37:11] attack them instantly if you run into
[00:37:13] them but I'm not actually sure
[00:37:17] and then you run faster after doing it
[00:37:25] wait let me try his I haven't I haven't
[00:37:27] used a technique I'm gonna be honest I
[00:37:28] haven't tried the technique
[00:37:30] I'm not a technique user well I am but I
[00:37:33] don't know I haven't used his
[00:37:35] uh where the [ __ ] is serious
[00:37:44] dude
[00:37:54] I mean okay I know what this technique
[00:37:56] does it gives you one stack of his all
[00:37:58] things so a free skill point and attack
[00:37:59] uh not attack it'll do damage based on
[00:38:02] his attack but like the the outs of
[00:38:03] combat thing I don't actually know
[00:38:07] oh yeah you can walk through them wait
[00:38:09] no you can't wait let me read it wait
[00:38:10] what if I Mouse
[00:38:12] this game sucks I don't actually know
[00:38:13] what this technique does but let me read
[00:38:15] it let me read it I haven't read it
[00:38:17] let me read it okay feel is auto
[00:38:19] battling
[00:38:21] minus one
[00:38:23] wait let me read it
[00:38:25] uh
[00:38:28] uh
[00:38:32] okay
[00:38:37] okay yes after you attack Okay cool so
[00:38:40] you do this and then that and then
[00:38:41] you're doing all the things okay cool
[00:38:43] makes sense
[00:38:45] okay let's go out about this
[00:38:55] I'm gonna put another DPS in this team
[00:38:58] because my imbibators level one
[00:39:01] um so I think blade can carry
[00:39:03] actually
[00:39:04] we're gonna let me do something we're
[00:39:07] gonna do this and then we're gonna do uh
[00:39:10] this
[00:39:13] there you go
[00:39:14] wait so
[00:39:18] and then what the
[00:39:21] I ran out of Rage
[00:39:26] I just don't want to Auto attack him
[00:39:27] wait

[00:42:01] surely
[00:42:07] boom
[00:42:09] 50. oh 60.

[00:42:15] a good start
[00:42:17] two single poles Don't Mind If I Do
[00:42:22] uh uh this is the energy we will take
[00:42:25] that this one is crowd control resist
[00:42:29] true we'll get that
[00:42:31] [Music]
[00:42:32] um we will level this we will level this
[00:42:36] we will level honestly I'm never gonna
[00:42:38] die I don't need the HP we might as well
[00:42:40] save our mats for now
[00:42:42] uh basic attack both supported
[00:42:48] and we'll level everything else

[00:43:43] I don't know why I'm like alternating
[00:43:47] okay good start
[00:43:48] uh well let's send them in a second but
[00:43:50] for now he should at least be palatable
[00:43:52] he should at least be palatable I would
[00:43:55] assume that I could clear it with him so
[00:43:57] let's play an actual team which is this
[00:43:59] one uh is my Pella geared I don't know
[00:44:02] she's on we don't talk about it uh she
[00:44:05] at least does have pieces though so it
[00:44:07] should be fine
[00:44:08] I need to give her the um this
[00:44:12] listen I just get through so she had HP
[00:44:14] and doesn't die that's the only reason
[00:44:16] we don't talk about it uh this is what I
[00:44:18] want to use though

[00:44:42] wait why is she on internet sausoto
[00:44:45] oh because that wait oh because I don't
[00:44:47] have an ER or something else right

[00:44:50] one but I'll use that on Ting Yoon
[00:44:53] okay yeah
[00:44:54] we'll be fine for now
[00:44:57] okay let's go

[00:46:46] use a skill on someone you basically
[00:46:47] Miss A
[00:46:48] third normal attack charge but it
[00:46:50] doesn't really matter this guy's Dead

[00:47:24] cool
[00:47:33] let's be friends
[00:47:37] pretty sure I give it to [ __ ] P like
[00:47:39] I said more energy I don't know why I
[00:47:42] pressed baseball I
[00:47:49] just gonna have a battle
[00:47:51] I don't want to talk about it I don't
[00:47:52] want to talk about it shut the [ __ ] up
[00:47:54] shut the [ __ ] up I was trying to go fast
[00:47:56] and I knew it would
[00:48:00] receive Divinity you still roll for
[00:48:03] Implant minus one skill point let's try
[00:48:05] bozo
[00:48:07] silver was still probably better but I
[00:48:09] don't know if I'm gonna use
[00:48:11] I don't know
[00:48:19] pillow's also like free to play so it's
[00:48:21] very
[00:48:23] it's a lot more like if I have the
[00:48:25] choice between two I'll just do
[00:48:26] something out of the team
[00:48:35] okay
[00:48:37] okay Auto Battle is kind of cooking just
[00:48:39] don't use skill they use peel let's go
[00:48:41] that's fine
[00:48:43] what will Auto Battle do on the next
[00:48:45] turn will it be a normal basic attack
[00:48:47] yes it will we have no skill points
[00:48:50] okay well
[00:48:52] that is quite unfortunate
[00:49:01] foreign
[00:49:09] wait no don't
[00:49:16] The Wrong Enemy
[00:49:18] okay Auto Battle is actually so stupid
[00:49:20] I'm just doing this manually now
[00:49:29] cool
[00:49:33] oh
[00:49:35] we're gonna use fuel
[00:49:36] I do not care
[00:49:39] okay uh we're gonna do this then we have
[00:49:42] enough uh energy true
[00:49:45] Pepe W okay I unironically got fuel from
[00:49:48] leveling when am I gonna spend it off
[00:49:50] stream no I'm gonna spend it when we get
[00:49:53] a [ __ ] new character why are you Pepe
[00:49:55] Wing me there's a reason I saved it
[00:50:06] wait I just used my
[00:50:10] I didn't know I already used I forgot
[00:50:13] it's fine we'll just do it too it's not
[00:50:14] a big deal
[00:50:15] it's not a big deal two's not even bad
[00:50:16] it's literally not even bad Shut the
[00:50:18] [ __ ] up it's actually not even bad shut
[00:50:20] up shut up shut up shut up shut up I
[00:50:21] just miss clicked it's fine
[00:50:32] I'm trying to relax and enjoy my video
[00:50:35] game uh let's do this then we'll get our
[00:50:38] alt true and then we'll do we have
[00:50:40] literally every alt Let's do an auto
[00:50:42] battle all the moment we'll do this and
[00:50:44] this and this
[00:50:48] Eternal statement
[00:50:54] let's do the opposite of Blade kind of
[00:50:56] but if you put them in the same team
[00:50:57] they kiss so that's something to keep in
[00:50:59] mind uh depending on what you are
[00:51:01] playing Star rail for depending on like
[00:51:02] what type of player you are if that
[00:51:03] makes sense
[00:51:16] not bad
[00:51:28] is Xiao good with Kafka honestly uh he
[00:51:31] would be uh
[00:51:34] that's a tough nut to crack oh we need
[00:51:36] five more
[00:51:38] okay let's get five more uh the one
[00:51:40] thing I want to do though is
[00:51:44] oh I should have done this off stream I
[00:51:46] want to level matching Cox
[00:51:49] I mean this gives 10 energy
[00:51:57] maybe we could use that instead
[00:51:59] we'd have to see exactly how much it is
[00:52:01] but
[00:52:03] homage
[00:52:04] homage
[00:52:19] that hung Stacks look like Among Us
[00:52:21] lympho
[00:52:23] there's no way you said that
[00:52:25] let me look
[00:52:27] okay they literally don't they literally
[00:52:30] don't
[00:52:30] Dave
[00:52:33] that's wrong that's what I meant it
[00:52:39] they don't they actually don't
[00:52:48] maybe when they're like colored let's
[00:52:49] see let me use my alts we'll see if when
[00:52:52] they're colored they look different
[00:52:54] dude is all this so [ __ ] beautiful
[00:52:58] no they don't I mean nah
[00:53:03] with my glasses off they do okay but
[00:53:06] that's a skill issue
[00:53:10] oh
[00:53:12] [ __ ] yeah
[00:53:13] the strength
[00:53:30] why a pillow hauling her book like that
[00:53:43] show build run for emblem a third fate
[00:53:48] hahaha
[00:53:53] okay how long is
[00:53:56] can you just die you have like one HP
[00:53:58] okay that's fine
[00:54:03] this is Among Us replace skill points
[00:54:05] yes they do when you alt on Dan Hong he
[00:54:07] basically gets two skill points like
[00:54:09] you'll get two of those among this thing
[00:54:10] okay now I'm calling him among us but
[00:54:12] whatever you get two among uses and then
[00:54:14] a mangai and then uh they count as skill
[00:54:16] points for him
[00:54:20] how do I not have branches
[00:54:24] does anyone know because I don't
[00:54:27] I literally have been [ __ ] I've been
[00:54:29] doing the the daily Expeditions whatever
[00:54:31] they're called assignments
[00:54:33] a Simon
[00:54:36] I'm going to the store I literally have
[00:54:38] been doing assignments I am not even
[00:54:39] joking right now I am literally not even
[00:54:41] yoking
[00:54:45] uh what else I don't want to buy I think
[00:54:47] we're good actually
[00:54:49] yeah I think we have the rest
[00:54:53] okay
[00:54:57] uh let's level let me set and already
[00:54:59] send them let me claim this
[00:55:01] let me level some traces uh which I can
[00:55:05] do by making all of my things purple so
[00:55:06] let's do that we're going to make all of
[00:55:08] them except two purple
[00:55:26] all right uh we're gonna level basic all
[00:55:29] the way
[00:55:30] never mind I can't XD yes I also can't
[00:55:32] this is worth
[00:55:34] imaginary damage worth
[00:55:37] this worth
[00:55:39] this worth
[00:55:41] this worth
[00:55:43] uh
[00:55:44] uh now I need more
[00:55:50] all good
[00:55:52] um let's make more so we're gonna go to
[00:55:53] uh this right here or the blue one do I
[00:55:55] have a lot of the blue ones no I don't
[00:55:56] have a lot of the green ones I kind of
[00:55:57] do I could make a green one okay I think
[00:55:59] I'm gonna do green we're gonna go we're
[00:56:01] gonna click these yep we're gonna put
[00:56:02] two of them oh confirm and then we're
[00:56:03] gonna do 84. yep then we're gonna make
[00:56:06] them into Blues by going here and then
[00:56:08] clicking on the blue one we're gonna
[00:56:09] make 29 good take
[00:56:14] okay uh I need to make sure I have
[00:56:16] enough for this this is pretty cracked
[00:56:18] so maybe I wait for now
[00:56:20] yeah let's just send him again first
[00:56:27] that's gonna burn him later okay it's
[00:56:29] not hard for me to kill random NPCs
[00:56:31] along the map it takes like two seconds
[00:56:32] it's just I don't know okay
[00:56:41] hit me hit me I [ __ ] dare you
[00:56:47] let's try you don't I do
[00:56:53] do we still have the upper hand
[00:57:01] uh we're gonna alts
[00:57:21] divinity
[00:57:24] foreign
[00:57:31] ergy a little but whatever
[00:57:38] nice we're actually getting our all back
[00:57:40] fast on pillow that's really good
[00:57:44] that means we have up time poggies
[00:57:53] nice
[00:57:57] all right
[00:58:11] [ __ ] let's go again
[00:58:14] do we still have sorry I'm sorry I'm
[00:58:17] sorry I'm sorry
[00:58:24] okay I could be wrong on this so don't
[00:58:26] quote me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty
[00:58:28] sure ER R rope on this guy is literally
[00:58:31] griefing your entire life because it's
[00:58:33] better to do your not even level three
[00:58:36] normals like to do a level two if you
[00:58:37] have an attack rope then a three if you
[00:58:39] don't like it's just not worth it just
[00:58:41] just [ __ ] go attack this is not it's
[00:58:43] literally just not rich
[00:58:46] welcome customers because you lose out
[00:58:48] on so much damage
[00:59:03] level three is pretty true but okay I
[00:59:06] don't know I don't know yet well I do
[00:59:08] know but I'm just gonna say I don't know
[00:59:10] because it's safer that way I feel like
[00:59:12] people that I've seen are kind of like
[00:59:17] okay
[00:59:18] okay I don't know if average player is
[00:59:21] gonna play dad hung uh ill in a [ __ ]
[00:59:24] random ass team where he sucks but if
[00:59:26] you play him in a like skill point
[00:59:27] efficient team it's like I feel like you
[00:59:29] can manage
[00:59:31] like you can manage to just like pretty
[00:59:34] consistently get the basic attacks you
[00:59:35] want
[00:59:37] and two is not bad either like you can
[00:59:39] do one or two I mean sorry sorry that
[00:59:40] was wrong you do three or two
[00:59:46] the only thing is like the thing is it's
[00:59:48] like okay sometimes shit's gonna go
[00:59:50] wrong so sometimes you're [ __ ] you'll
[00:59:52] play against Kafka she'll dominate your
[00:59:54] entire team you have to cleanse three
[00:59:55] characters you have to use pila's skill
[00:59:57] to remove a [ __ ] buff on an enemy you
[00:59:59] have to they call the IRS on you you
[01:00:01] have to like sometimes you have to do a
[01:00:02] lot of things and then you'll lose out
[01:00:04] on some skill points it's fine okay at
[01:00:06] that like I get it if that doesn't
[01:00:08] happen and everything goes smooth you
[01:00:10] can spam your three or you do like three
[01:00:11] two two two if you alter before turns
[01:00:13] because you're weird it's there's a few
[01:00:14] different things it's fine but
[01:00:16] usually you can get away with fully
[01:00:18] stacking your normal attack and you're
[01:00:20] chilling
[01:00:21] that [ __ ] happens and that's okay and
[01:00:23] then you can just do your second charge
[01:00:24] uh you do two charges at a three and
[01:00:26] it's still pretty good
[01:00:28] strengths
[01:00:43] those who say uses too many seconds I've
[01:00:45] never played QQ yeah but at least with
[01:00:46] QQ you get the Gamba
[01:00:48] which feeds my addiction not addiction
[01:00:50] my enjoyment Pro
[01:00:53] are you on Speeders speed
[01:00:56] I'm a speedy man
[01:00:58] I don't think I have enough speed yet
[01:00:59] though I don't think I'm one three four
[01:01:02] but we're still we're still gearing them
[01:01:03] we're in the board in the process you
[01:01:05] know we're in the process
[01:01:08] tell me his best set I will go insane
[01:01:17] what happens then what happens that I
[01:01:19] wanna I wanna see you go inside
[01:01:23] either musketeer or the
[01:01:25] um imaginary set they're the two good
[01:01:27] ones or you could like substat like uh
[01:01:29] two pieces
[01:01:36] repent wait repent kind of sounds like
[01:01:39] Lament
[01:01:41] that wasn't funny I'll shut up
[01:01:48] good alternative lycone
[01:01:52] um so the thing is his alternative free
[01:01:55] to play lycon is also his not
[01:01:57] alternative lycombe that everyone wants
[01:01:59] anyways
[01:02:00] so just go to her the store be like hey
[01:02:03] there urda and then buy the [ __ ]
[01:02:05] destruction thing and then you're
[01:02:06] chilling
[01:02:08] how are you doing there erda
[01:02:12] my name's erda
[01:02:20] I can't afford it then simulate more
[01:02:23] universes no I mean there's other
[01:02:25] options
[01:02:26] um I don't know what it's called but the
[01:02:28] light cone that looks like white I
[01:02:29] actually I don't know why I can't
[01:02:30] remember the name it gives you attacking
[01:02:31] crit rate it's pretty good uh Arlen's
[01:02:33] icon is fine Clara's icon's okay his
[01:02:36] signature is bet uh his best and then I
[01:02:38] think there's another
[01:02:40] I think those are the main ones uh the
[01:02:42] [ __ ] what is it called
[01:02:44] the the battle pass one is not good for
[01:02:46] stats but itself heals you which can be
[01:02:49] okay if you're running a dog [ __ ] healer
[01:02:51] and you don't want to spend skill points
[01:02:53] having a bit of self-healing can be kind
[01:02:55] of convenient it's still not like
[01:02:56] amazing but it can be okay
[01:03:09] uh sorry no I thought it was better late
[01:03:12] than never
[01:03:18] every time I waste a skill point a baby
[01:03:21] kitten cries
[01:03:24] foreign
[01:03:46] so yeah like we're ulting every three
[01:03:47] turns which means that now even if we
[01:03:49] only have two skill points we can still
[01:03:51] do a fully charged one which is why I
[01:03:52] like Ting Yoon is so valuable
[01:03:54] or his signature like home you can you
[01:03:56] can return oh dude I keep rolling over
[01:03:58] my headset you can three turn off with
[01:04:00] either signature icon or Ting Yoon
[01:04:07] I'm pretty sure e 16 Yoon and his lycone
[01:04:10] you can two turn alt but I don't know
[01:04:14] um yeah
[01:04:20] dude why does he
[01:04:31] wait I thought I only needed [ __ ] I need
[01:04:33] 35. wait chat okay chat chat chat chat
[01:04:35] chat chat chat Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha
[01:04:37] Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha chat I have
[01:04:42] uh 35 of these and I'm never gonna use
[01:04:45] them ever so should I convert them into
[01:04:47] the these just avoid killing more
[01:04:49] because like what am I gonna do with
[01:04:50] them
[01:04:54] well like literally what can I do with
[01:04:55] them like no one uses them unless they
[01:04:57] release a character in like five years
[01:05:01] I accidentally farmed too many
[01:05:04] I just like pre-farmed way too many for
[01:05:05] I think Kafka yeah I prefarmed too many
[01:05:08] for Kafka
[01:05:12] I just was like mindlessly Auto battling
[01:05:14] and then I made too many
[01:05:17] nail of the ape
[01:05:23] it's two to one yeah but like I don't
[01:05:25] think any other character uses these so
[01:05:27] like unless they release someone that
[01:05:28] does I don't see the point of keeping
[01:05:30] them
[01:05:35] yeah maybe I mean maybe they will but
[01:05:38] for now it's like yeah oh it's fine
[01:05:42] boom okay so we can now Ascend them
[01:05:45] please don't have enough oh I do easy
[01:05:48] I'm gonna get him to 80 because look at
[01:05:50] him wait do I need to send someone let
[01:05:52] me think
[01:05:55] ah [ __ ] it
[01:05:57] childhood's end
[01:05:59] here you go
[01:06:02] wait am I one speed short there's no way
[01:06:05] right there's no one through these five
[01:06:06] truly there's no way I'm surely I'm not
[01:06:13] [Laughter]
[01:06:16] okay
[01:06:17] what
[01:06:19] you're [ __ ] with me right there's no
[01:06:21] way I'm
[01:06:27] someone somewhere is [ __ ] with me
[01:06:31] well to be fair this is my series rope
[01:06:33] so if I can get a better one
[01:06:35] from just like farming or something
[01:06:41] um okay let me elaborate on that even
[01:06:44] more ideally we go rudeland Arena so
[01:06:46] I'll probably get a better set soon
[01:06:47] anyways so I think it's okay if we're
[01:06:49] not one three four right now because
[01:06:52] we're gonna Farm another set anyways
[01:06:55] um
[01:06:58] but for now we can go with
[01:07:02] how much dude how much horses are crit
[01:07:04] rate right now wait this is fine I mean
[01:07:07] we lost some crit damage but
[01:07:11] wait I need to make sure my team's
[01:07:12] faster
[01:07:13] oh my God that [ __ ] everything
[01:07:18] dude it's literally
[01:07:20] he needs okay dude I hate this game okay
[01:07:24] we need like we need like two speed on
[01:07:26] this we need like two speed
[01:07:29] not six we need like two
[01:07:33] I hate speed tuning
[01:07:37] oh no RT you need to be even faster too
[01:07:39] because at E1 right
[01:07:40] yeah because of this I need to I need
[01:07:42] her to be even faster wait why is she so
[01:07:44] slow
[01:07:45] I'm on okay shut the [ __ ] up okay uh
[01:07:50] listen listen listen listen listen
[01:07:53] listen shut the [ __ ] up listen everyone
[01:07:55] chill everyone chill I can fix this
[01:08:01] can he fix it yes he can surely I have
[01:08:04] one speed boot one
[01:08:08] maybe it's levels maybe it's leveled oh
[01:08:09] it's on The Witcher though [ __ ]
[01:08:12] [ __ ] I can go this set I got this side
[01:08:17] like uh two piece
[01:08:20] or even four but ideally it's probably
[01:08:23] two
[01:08:29] dude I
[01:08:41] oh is it a decimal moment for the other
[01:08:44] Lucha build is it actually
[01:08:47] wait let me do this
[01:08:50] yeah yeah let me check
[01:08:54] wait what did I just do I'll give the
[01:08:56] Woodshop a bit less because Ting Yun is
[01:09:10] wow effect hit rate
[01:09:17] I mean honestly this isn't bad if we
[01:09:18] just get like attack percent on uh speed
[01:09:20] boots pretty good
[01:09:22] okay we got 53 that's cool
[01:09:28] uh uh okay let's see
[01:09:34] wait where is it silly surely we're not
[01:09:37] right
[01:09:41] you don't have to check it doesn't show
[01:09:43] the desk I probably have to check right
[01:09:44] ah let's just assume it's enough
[01:09:50] I mean to be fair we also gained speed
[01:09:51] for a turn when we uh Alt
[01:09:54] but
[01:10:00] he he ha
[01:10:12] one sec chat uh I need to change teams
[01:10:15] uh uh uh uh uh uh uh thing to
[01:10:20] what is it called
[01:10:22] vorcak Von wack
[01:10:27] Lumberjack there it is we need to go
[01:10:29] this well we don't need to I think we're
[01:10:30] actually fine without it but I want to
[01:10:31] go this I just don't have a ball
[01:10:34] okay we're gonna have to do this world
[01:10:36] for like the first time ever
[01:10:41] I haven't done that [ __ ] like world
[01:10:43] four or whatever in like 17 decibels
[01:10:50] but it's really the universe is fun so
[01:10:53] use this technique then spam left click
[01:10:54] sure this technique is the one part that
[01:10:56] we haven't really haven't really used
[01:10:58] much so I do need to
[01:11:00] figure out how it works should I go next
[01:11:02] to an enemy or just here
[01:11:05] oh
[01:11:08] wait
[01:11:12] okay he [ __ ] power crapped yolan
[01:11:15] what the hell
[01:11:17] yeah Power craft Yukon
[01:11:21] this lasts for 20 seconds right holy
[01:11:23] [ __ ]
[01:11:24] that's pretty cool
[01:11:26] guy like that
[01:11:28] how do you not know that I just don't
[01:11:29] dude I don't know techniques I just I
[01:11:31] don't really give a [ __ ] I mean
[01:11:33] techniques are good like wow you reduce
[01:11:35] the fence but like I don't know
[01:11:39] I kind of look at them last usually
[01:11:45] check new emotes
[01:11:48] like in chat I don't message people on
[01:11:51] honkai Star rail
[01:11:53] only message I have ever sent and it's
[01:11:55] still one of my mods
[01:11:57] well friends
[01:12:02] I I only have like three friends
[01:12:08] hey man how are you
[01:12:11] how how you been XD
[01:12:19] hey heardo
[01:12:21] okay never mind shut up
[01:12:24] anyways we need to get uh it's a new
[01:12:26] week it's a new me we need to get
[01:12:28] another Super imposer so let's get a
[01:12:30] herd of bond because I have one it costs
[01:12:33] two one plus one is two that's true you
[01:12:35] can write that down which means we'll be
[01:12:36] able to buy another and superimpose are
[01:12:38] on the fall of an aeon
[01:12:42] I want to do world seven but I also want
[01:12:44] to do is it five or four that has Von
[01:12:46] kak oh it's four so we need to do we
[01:12:48] need to get Von back we don't need to
[01:12:50] but I want to because I want to see if
[01:12:51] it actually changes anything
[01:12:54] um
[01:12:56] for Big T
[01:13:00] and then we should be chilling
[01:13:15] so we'll do four we'll do six and we'll
[01:13:18] do seven and then we'll do memory chaos
[01:13:19] probably
[01:13:21] it doesn't
[01:13:24] for what I mean for three turns I know
[01:13:26] it doesn't but
[01:13:28] I'm pretty sure there's another break
[01:13:29] point okay I could be wrong because I
[01:13:31] didn't get to try this on my account
[01:13:32] because I'm [ __ ] scuffed right now
[01:13:34] but I'm pretty sure there's another
[01:13:36] break point you can hit with uh meshing
[01:13:39] plus err rope 15 plus that Von wax set
[01:13:42] but I need to try it
[01:13:46] I'm gonna get this to 15 though
[01:13:53] cogs yeah but Cog is always that's five
[01:13:56] like you get that for free
[01:14:16] alternatives are skill basic basic
[01:14:22] well okay you also started memory of
[01:14:24] chaos with half of your well I guess
[01:14:26] that's only for one fight but you can
[01:14:27] use your Technique but you start Moc
[01:14:29] with half of your alt ready so it kind
[01:14:31] of like
[01:14:35] well I guess it doesn't matter but yeah
[01:14:39] I don't know
[01:14:41] good to know though
[01:14:43] okay let's do a four
[01:14:48] what the [ __ ] is this oh it's [ __ ]
[01:14:49] strong okay we're gonna we're gonna get
[01:14:51] pounded
[01:14:52] we're gonna get ass blasted from [ __ ]
[01:14:54] swarog
[01:14:56] the absolute Chad
[01:15:00] the unshakable Goliath that is farrog
[01:15:05] uh let's make more of uh let's make more
[01:15:08] of these
[01:15:10] hey why don't you just kill enemies to
[01:15:12] get some shut up I will I literally will
[01:15:14] I literally will just give me time
[01:15:29] uh how much dude this costs eight
[01:15:33] oh but that Critter is so nice
[01:15:36] that Critter is so juicy
[01:15:38] it's fine I'll fire it off stream I can
[01:15:40] level two things yeah we're gonna level
[01:15:41] normals for sure and then
[01:15:44] these are all pretty similar how often
[01:15:46] are we we're gonna hold every three
[01:15:48] turns it might actually be
[01:16:06] yeah we'll do this
[01:16:08] okay
[01:16:09] one two
[01:16:12] uh I probably want silver wolf here
[01:16:18] yeah he probably wants to roll up here
[01:16:21] time for a bug
[01:16:28] okay we're gonna lose by the way
[01:16:39] fixer build what's wrong with my oh
[01:16:46] how does that even have okay let me put
[01:16:48] this uh I okay let's put this around
[01:16:54] Quantum implant okay here's what's gonna
[01:16:56] happen we get this Far Rock right we
[01:16:58] implant it's a 50 50. if we get Quantum
[01:17:01] we alt f4 go again
[01:17:03] agree or disagree
[01:17:12] it's a 50 50.
[01:17:15] really we win it
[01:17:37] can we do it
[01:17:45] uh yo I would Loki wish I could do this
[01:17:48] without a path
[01:17:49] I just wanted like I just want to kill
[01:17:51] the things but then I'm gonna die so
[01:17:53] let's do um
[01:17:54] what should I do probably hunt
[01:17:57] 's got a fun I mean remembrance is just
[01:18:00] freeze them
[01:18:01] but
[01:18:05] foreign
[01:18:13] how is hunt bench
[01:18:20] is the new rope and ball good for Dan
[01:18:23] Hung okay what do you mean rope and ball
[01:18:25] why do you say it like that you mean the
[01:18:27] world seven yeah Ritalin Arenas is best
[01:18:29] if that's what you're talking about
[01:18:32] it's not like super far ahead so if you
[01:18:35] already have like a space stealing
[01:18:37] station or innard South Soto they're
[01:18:38] okay
[01:18:39] but
[01:18:40] um the new one's the best
[01:18:43] all right let's go Discord
[01:18:51] do you think it'll hit me if I just walk
[01:18:53] no I didn't
[01:19:02] would you be mad at me if I Auto Battle

[01:19:22] minus four all it was only three okay we
[01:19:25] didn't get anything we want reset
[01:19:27] oh eject the borison or reject the Run
[01:19:30] true
[01:19:32] uh this kind of [ __ ] with how we play
[01:19:34] though because then we'll feel weird but
[01:19:36] whatever
[01:19:38] I'll get it uh uh okay
[01:19:42] wow okay well at least we can get
[01:19:44] Clockwork Apple
[01:19:48] I don't want to get this because it
[01:19:49] gives us a skill point and then it'll I
[01:19:51] don't want that I don't want that I
[01:19:52] don't want more skill points let me play
[01:19:54] Dan hung ill as God intended we're gonna
[01:19:56] do uh okay these are useless
[01:20:00] I mean this is technically good I just
[01:20:02] don't want it
[01:20:22] don't play the Swarm mode then dude I
[01:20:24] just

[01:21:14] when is the new path gonna drop uh in
[01:21:16] 3.0 we're gonna get dendro
[01:21:18] but in this game it's gonna be called
[01:21:20] grass
[01:21:42] yep grass
[01:21:46] oh wait they what the [ __ ] why did their
[01:21:49] curse look like that
[01:21:51] also it goes faster when I click
[01:21:54] what the hell
[01:21:57] are you [ __ ] this is our that is our
[01:22:00] only bad blessing
[01:22:03] and it has their only bad one
[01:22:07] yeah they look like this now [ __ ]
[01:22:09] Picasso painting
[01:22:13] and look it goes faster like I'll spam
[01:22:15] click oh well there's only one line but
[01:22:16] well Pat it lightly uh you suck okay
[01:22:19] well we'll probably lightly again
[01:22:21] you gained enough
[01:22:28] costumes
[01:22:37] unfortunate
[01:22:40] we're in trouble now
[01:22:41] I hate starting with all my alts it like
[01:22:43] puts it stresses me like it's like I
[01:22:45] want to use all of them but I don't want
[01:22:46] to use any of them
[01:22:48] this is double speed okay watch this
[01:22:51] watch us watch this okay we're gonna
[01:22:53] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[01:22:54] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[01:22:55] we're gonna save the energy no but to me
[01:22:57] is kind of energy hungry
[01:22:59] yeah we'll do this we'll continue to get
[01:23:01] energy because she's she's hungry she
[01:23:03] wants energy
[01:23:25] it was more hungry now we're about to
[01:23:27] get our Outback watch Steve
[01:23:30] the hunt moment
[01:23:42] wow this really simulated my universe
[01:23:57] okay uh if I press reset blessing and we
[01:24:00] don't get a hunt I will not just alter
[01:24:02] for the simulated Universe I will alter
[01:24:05] for the Stream
[01:24:08] okay
[01:24:10] dude I actually can't
[01:24:14] I mean
[01:24:18] Okay I lied about altaforing the stream
[01:24:20] it's whatever it's fine uh we'll get
[01:24:23] [ __ ] doctors robe I guess whatever
[01:24:28] all right we need a
[01:24:33] refresh too let's spend a refuel well
[01:24:36] ideally we get
[01:24:37] oh two dude 240 cap is so nice
[01:24:41] when trailblaze power exceeds or reaches
[01:24:43] the max Reserve trailblade power will
[01:24:45] begin to regenerate over time Reserve
[01:24:46] trailer power covers one point every 18
[01:24:48] minutes okay very slow Max of 2400 wait
[01:24:51] what the [ __ ]
[01:24:53] wait 2400 is so much
[01:24:56] dude if you don't play for like a week
[01:24:58] you save like
[01:25:00] is it one to one is that like 2K resin
[01:25:02] the hell
[01:25:04] oh yeah it's kind of cracked
[01:25:09] 10 days yeah it's 240 a day well
[01:25:12] yeah because well it's 18 minutes each
[01:25:16] charges up slower yeah but it doesn't
[01:25:18] matter because it's just like resin you
[01:25:20] wouldn't have otherwise
[01:25:22] like you don't want this to fill up but
[01:25:24] like sometimes you know life happens
[01:25:25] life happens sometimes
[01:25:33] damn that's pretty cool I like that and
[01:25:35] 240 cap obviously is like really nice
[01:25:41] I mean to be fair when Gen increased
[01:25:43] their cap to 160 like three years ago
[01:25:45] people like everyone was mad about it
[01:25:49] oh we asked for more water and you gave
[01:25:51] us a bigger cup I mean true uh okay
[01:25:54] we're gonna use like we're gonna use
[01:25:55] this on TuneIn by the way it doesn't
[01:25:57] [ __ ] like we want attack but I don't
[01:25:58] really care I just want to be able to
[01:26:00] use the two piece I think we're
[01:26:01] literally done here I don't want to ever
[01:26:02] do this world again well I guess you
[01:26:03] should finish it but I don't think we
[01:26:05] even need to keep going I just want to
[01:26:07] try this out on her
[01:26:11] um
[01:26:12] fine we'll download someone
[01:26:19] now we can gamble
[01:26:24] oh man it's still too low I I do think
[01:26:26] 160 is absolutely still too low for the
[01:26:28] record I'm not saying it's like it's
[01:26:30] definitely too low it's just
[01:26:33] I don't know
[01:26:38] why'd I do that no you [ __ ] no no no
[01:26:42] are they linked I can't tell I can't
[01:26:44] tell if there's a yo I did
[01:26:46] it says Battlestar one of two I think
[01:26:48] that I don't know hopefully they were
[01:26:49] linked hopefully hopefully they're
[01:26:52] linked right
[01:26:57] hopefully
[01:27:00] you took the bait
[01:27:03] time for a bug watch
[01:27:07] maybe that's her skill actually I I
[01:27:09] lowkey forgot the voice on I'm pretty
[01:27:10] sure it's the skill

[01:30:12] 800 and Guild of the dreams probably
[01:30:13] like around 1K if you can
[01:30:15] you could use the blood tainted
[01:30:17] Greatsword or something like that
[01:30:19] um because it has a really high base
[01:30:20] attack uh for a three-star weapon
[01:30:23] like it's higher than the four stars so
[01:30:26] yeah
[01:30:28] mailed flowers you can use as well

[01:33:11] damn
[01:33:13] this is good
[01:33:15] okay
[01:33:17] that's actually not bad because less
[01:33:18] damage okay pog
[01:33:20] I was lucky
[01:33:22] oh I probably shouldn't claim ew ew
[01:33:29] I mean I guess the we do still want
[01:33:32] [ __ ] Von whack but
[01:33:35] whatever
[01:33:38] what's up Staffing
[01:33:42] how he goes about Shaman and even if you
[01:33:44] don't have that hung it was like on
[01:33:45] [ __ ] he's not wind he's
[01:33:48] imaginary I have blades lycone
[01:33:52] also I'm trying to figure out if I can
[01:33:54] three turn onto this which I know I can
[01:33:57] but I don't want to get a like on that
[01:33:58] focus on my energy because then it [ __ ]
[01:33:59] with how I understand the character and
[01:34:01] my brain is too simple
[01:34:04] and smooth
[01:34:05] I'm gonna go I know this is probably the
[01:34:07] dumbest thing we could pick right now
[01:34:09] but I'm gonna Gamba
[01:34:11] there is no world where that was the
[01:34:13] correct decision by the way in case
[01:34:14] you're wondering
[01:34:20] but if Galactic big Lotto is wrong then
[01:34:23] I Don't Want to Be Right
[01:34:36] okay
[01:34:42] yeah
[01:34:45] I don't know why I did that
[01:34:55] oh you're not getting the icon I don't
[01:34:58] know if I'll get it but I want to play
[01:34:59] him without it first
[01:35:05] okay
[01:35:08] wow well at least every time an enemy
[01:35:11] takes damage from a DOT all allies will
[01:35:13] restore HP
[01:35:16] that's fine
[01:35:26] time for a DOT oh maybe that's what
[01:35:29] silver wolf says
[01:35:43] why are these guys [ __ ] they're Deep
[01:35:46] Purple
[01:35:58] [ __ ] it
[01:35:59] we're gonna Overkill these guys
[01:36:05] this is double double speed
[01:36:18] cleansing dragon
[01:36:24] man he's not dead
[01:36:32] yo this is the prime uh
[01:36:35] I don't know what I just said I'm sorry
[01:36:36] criterate we take those
[01:36:39] skip I'm gonna take the left one oh well
[01:36:41] wait I skipped twice
[01:36:47] okay I've done like
[01:36:49] I've done a lot of simulator versus runs
[01:36:52] through I runs right and I don't think I
[01:36:54] have ever ever in my life finished a run
[01:36:58] where my Cosmic big Lotto wasn't
[01:37:01] destroyed so I have a theory like I'm
[01:37:03] pretty sure that if I break all three of
[01:37:04] these it's like guaranteed to be
[01:37:05] destroyed but I I wanna I just test for
[01:37:07] myself okay it didn't cool well there
[01:37:10] you go
[01:37:11] we're chilling uh what Alberta I mean it
[01:37:14] has something okay well
[01:37:17] okay
[01:37:21] ready when you
[01:37:24] are let's wait and see
[01:37:30] dude he literally can't even see me
[01:37:36] literally I would play them
[01:37:43] uh do I need to think about this fight
[01:37:45] or can I just Unga Bunga it looks like
[01:37:47] I'm about to move twice so I might as
[01:37:49] well use my alts to get more energy back
[01:37:51] is
[01:38:00] this combat needs optimizing oh yeah I
[01:38:04] said I would alt that four if we don't
[01:38:05] get imaginary implants whatever 50 50
[01:38:07] roll the dice pay the price all right we
[01:38:09] got it nice I was fully expecting not to
[01:38:11] get it okay cool
[01:38:20] pressing here there's literally nothing
[01:38:22] right
[01:38:23] because it's like about the normal but
[01:38:24] then I just use alternate it literally
[01:38:25] does nothing true
[01:38:36] time we have this
[01:38:40] [ __ ] if they died okay well
[01:38:42] um surely to you and you get her enough
[01:38:44] energy from this surely surely surely
[01:38:46] surely surely surely surely surely
[01:38:51] soon soon we'll have the better we'll
[01:38:54] have the set on here we'll have the set
[01:38:55] on here soon soon
[01:38:58] um time for a bug
[01:39:00] now let's not change the implant let's
[01:39:02] just sing off to do that and then do
[01:39:04] that and then if they're not dead with
[01:39:05] Charles yeah I just broke it whatever
[01:39:09] we do this let me do this can we do this
[01:39:23] holy [ __ ]
[01:39:25] Ed well
[01:39:27] um that was cool
[01:39:33] no when is the I'm afraid of the hand
[01:39:35] he's about to eat one of my [ __ ]
[01:39:37] characters
[01:39:41] no oh wait it's third phase never mind
[01:39:43] I'm done I thought this was P3 okay
[01:39:44] we're gonna let P2
[01:39:46] Eternal sleep
[01:39:51] dude I haven't done this world I
[01:39:53] literally haven't done this world except
[01:39:55] to clear it once because I never [ __ ]
[01:39:57] do a world four okay we're gonna do
[01:40:00] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[01:40:01] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[01:40:02] we're gonna do this then silver wolf
[01:40:03] you're gonna implant no I don't have
[01:40:05] enough skill points because if I still
[01:40:06] roll with e then I time for a bug and
[01:40:08] then I Ting uni then my dad Hong has no
[01:40:11] skill points so we're gonna base attack
[01:40:15] then we're gonna we I mean we need to
[01:40:17] Alt
[01:40:18] oh team moves twice okay I'm gonna blame
[01:40:20] that on uh simulated universe
[01:40:23] but even if he doesn't normally we have
[01:40:25] two skill points which is still fine but
[01:40:26] now we got three poggers
[01:40:29] gonna take some damage
[01:40:47] [ __ ] well
[01:40:49] um okay if I add one more energy we
[01:40:52] would have two skill points basically
[01:40:54] for free so
[01:40:55] just ignore this animation
[01:40:59] okay it's fine it's literally not even
[01:41:01] bad it's literally not even bad it's not
[01:41:02] even bad we get a skill point
[01:41:10] nice
[01:41:16] in my humble opinion
[01:41:21] Dan Hong's level zero basic is like if
[01:41:23] you need a skill point it's like it's
[01:41:26] like it it can make it's like it's it's
[01:41:28] it's a thing it's not good but like you
[01:41:32] know I think his worst one is his level
[01:41:34] one one the level one one is so [ __ ]
[01:41:36] ass level twos good level three is
[01:41:38] really good and then zeros and one both
[01:41:41] suck with zero is better than one
[01:41:42] because at least get a skill point so
[01:41:43] like
[01:41:44] yeah
[01:41:48] uh I might as well Alt
[01:41:57] he's skill point hungry isn't he hey I
[01:41:59] give him my skill point
[01:42:06] I did not say that
[01:42:08] like here for example enemy seven
[01:42:10] percent HP is about to change phases
[01:42:13] a smart player that isn't me you could
[01:42:15] just do like a let's say you kill him
[01:42:16] with a level zero or level one or level
[01:42:18] two normal attack you just do that you
[01:42:19] don't have to go all the way or waste
[01:42:20] your alt like I did because I'm a
[01:42:22] dumbass but it was to prove a point true
[01:42:27] now he's gonna summon this dude please
[01:42:29] don't eat me
[01:42:30] who's he gonna take who's he gonna take
[01:42:32] silver wolf
[01:42:33] that's perfect we didn't even [ __ ]
[01:42:36] need you sorry that was kind of mean
[01:42:39] um I mean true but also mean we're gonna
[01:42:41] lose
[01:42:52] I'm gonna press R right after this
[01:42:55] attack
[01:43:00] she's the quarter team no she's not
[01:43:03] we're not mono imaginary
[01:43:15] then we kill this so we move again
[01:43:17] instantly or we get her all back into
[01:43:18] the noise he's not dead he's not dead
[01:43:20] he's gonna don't you dare don't you
[01:43:22] [ __ ] dare
[01:43:24] wait a break I am so I I literally
[01:43:27] outplayed the out player I broke them
[01:43:29] before he could eat me
[01:43:32] wait why did his action get Advanced
[01:43:35] wait
[01:43:36] I okay it's probably some blessing that
[01:43:38] I'm forgetting about
[01:43:39] okay
[01:43:41] um
[01:43:42] you chose The Wrong Enemy okay both of
[01:43:45] the hands are about to move
[01:43:47] but we're about to get this back so we
[01:43:49] might be able to do something dumb what
[01:43:50] if I do this and then
[01:43:55] that's fine
[01:43:57] that's fine
[01:44:00] haven't searched
[01:44:05] man trick you smart
[01:44:15] sorry excuse my language
[01:44:24] wait
[01:44:25] okay I mean that was fine I just thought
[01:44:27] it was his turn that worked
[01:44:34] I'll steal my dad home
[01:44:36] oh that's also bad
[01:44:41] we can almost break it
[01:44:43] do I get my old I don't think I get my
[01:44:44] old back from this I have on an ER row
[01:44:46] but
[01:44:48] look at this
[01:44:52] okay
[01:45:06] oh nice yes yes I cleared it yeah
[01:45:13] all right we did it uh I really don't
[01:45:15] need to claim this [ __ ] world but I
[01:45:17] mean I want to try Von wax so maybe
[01:45:18] we'll get like a maybe we'll get like a
[01:45:21] usable ball maybe I don't know oh my God
[01:45:23] what is this
[01:45:26] [Applause]
[01:45:29] okay I can't end on that I'm going again
[01:45:31] I'm sorry oh
[01:45:42] it's all good you win some you lose some
[01:45:44] at least we won the 50 50.
[01:45:48] wait what did I just get was that my
[01:45:49] first time clearing why did I just get
[01:45:51] two wait was that actually my first time
[01:45:52] clearing
[01:45:53] craft the arrow rope I did so the whole
[01:45:55] reason I did that was I just wanted one
[01:45:57] ball any anything so I shouldn't have
[01:45:59] claimed three times I don't have to
[01:46:00] claim once or technically zero but yeah
[01:46:03] it's fine I just I was like I might as
[01:46:04] well oh well I mean I'm never gonna use
[01:46:06] this but we'll keep it I guess what
[01:46:08] about the Rope
[01:46:12] yeah unlucky but yeah we already cried I
[01:46:14] already Force crafted one where is it uh
[01:46:17] uh where's the set
[01:46:18] there no
[01:46:20] it's [ __ ] green
[01:46:22] am I blind did I already level it I'm
[01:46:25] gonna yo am I I'm actually blind
[01:46:29] oh this is this there it is
[01:46:32] I thought it was greener than it is it's
[01:46:33] kind of like a weird like blue I don't
[01:46:35] know
[01:46:36] yeah so we did we force crafted this
[01:46:41] how do you get a non-character five-star
[01:46:43] lycon what do you mean like just a
[01:46:45] random one or like this I'll show you so
[01:46:46] you go to the standard banner I have a
[01:46:48] free Temple boom you do it it's gonna be
[01:46:49] a licorn look you can pick one ask for
[01:46:51] one and you'll get a watch
[01:46:53] yeah well
[01:47:02] oh
[01:47:04] wait we got to dude
[01:47:07] wait that's huge okay that's actually
[01:47:09] probably the best four star we could
[01:47:12] have gotten
[01:47:14] I think they meant heard us like on oh
[01:47:17] um
[01:47:19] well okay in case you're wondering about
[01:47:20] this you can go to uh this shop
[01:47:22] Starlight and if you've pulled it off
[01:47:24] you can buy whichever one of these but
[01:47:26] if you talk about the one with no
[01:47:27] character on it yeah that's hurt us true
[01:47:29] which is in this thing so like
[01:47:33] yeah there's a new one now too I
[01:47:35] actually haven't read it
[01:47:38] oh that's pretty pop for uh dot
[01:47:40] characters
[01:47:42] but yeah

[01:48:09] effectres yeah
[01:48:15] oh yeah we're also getting yeah we're
[01:48:17] also getting another character in
[01:48:18] literally the second half
[01:48:20] okay but dude okay this is also the
[01:48:22] thing dude it's actually impossible dude

[01:51:25] Relic I'm probably not gonna use well I
[01:51:27] probably will use it actually so it's an
[01:51:29] investment
[01:51:31] uh let me unlock something to throw away

[01:53:29] The Relic is this one no it's not it is
[01:53:32] this one yes it is boom boom okay
[01:53:37] I'm gonna pretend I don't see Fang's
[01:53:38] messages
[01:53:40] um
[01:53:41] where did it go Sage did I remove it
[01:53:44] wait did I just lock it by accident
[01:53:46] where the [ __ ] did it go there's I
[01:53:48] actually locked it
[01:53:49] um
[01:53:53] attack is uh pretty good for tingyun it
[01:53:56] doesn't I mean effector is also nice
[01:53:58] I swear to Yuna always gets detained
[01:54:03] that's a tough nut to crack
[01:54:11] I told my therapist about you now my
[01:54:13] therapist needs a therapist
[01:54:15] that didn't happen that literally didn't
[01:54:18] happen
[01:54:19] that literally did not happen
[01:54:25] but also that's normal if if if if if if
[01:54:28] if if
[01:54:28] okay ask a therapist they'll be like
[01:54:31] yeah most people should have a therapist
[01:54:32] so that means that they also should have
[01:54:34] one because you can't therapist yourself
[01:54:36] if you're a hairdresser you're not gonna
[01:54:38] cut your own hair if you're a [ __ ]
[01:54:39] plastic surgeon you're not gonna plastic
[01:54:41] surgery yourself if you're a tattoo
[01:54:43] artist you're not gonna tattoo yourself
[01:54:45] so it's like a therapist would need
[01:54:47] another therapist anyways I'm throwing
[01:54:49] faster artifacts I don't care strongbox

[01:56:02] minus one planet minus who who's from
[01:56:05] this planet let me look it up I'm
[01:56:07] looking it up Hong Kong Wiki Von wack
[01:56:13] is a small and crowded Planet almost
[01:56:15] entirely covered by rainforests and
[01:56:17] islands with its exuberant Wildlife
[01:56:19] being the most recognizable feature
[01:56:22] is anyone from here
[01:56:27] Yan Ming
[01:56:29] I don't know
[01:56:31] Ting Yoon claimed that the saint sand
[01:56:34] Citrus seeds from The Bitter Water
[01:56:35] Confederacy are okay I don't care
[01:56:40] oh all good good to know about the lore
[01:56:43] I guess
[01:56:47] uh we're gonna We're Not Gonna level
[01:56:48] this I just wanna see if this works
[01:56:51] um our team has like no HP so if we die
[01:56:53] but it's fine
[01:57:00] I have this unlocked
[01:57:06] um
[01:57:07] well I think everything else is Chill I
[01:57:08] should probably level other traces just
[01:57:10] to make her stronger but
[01:57:15] why do you read like a kindergarten
[01:57:17] teacher I don't what are you doing okay
[01:57:21] okay I literally don't only 1K attack
[01:57:24] dude my weapon is level one we are just
[01:57:26] testing something okay we are trying
[01:57:28] something indention impact when we are
[01:57:30] testing a team or a rotation we fight an
[01:57:32] enemy with no weapons on our level one
[01:57:34] weapon so that we don't kill it we don't
[01:57:36] want to kill the masanori because we do
[01:57:38] too much damage it is the same thing
[01:57:40] here
[01:57:46] um I don't know where to go I can go
[01:57:47] marry a chaos but you kinda
[01:57:50] scratch I mean I guess we could just
[01:57:51] memory chaos
[01:57:53] let's try there
[01:57:56] but we start with a lot of energy so
[01:57:57] I'll make sure to like I'll start with a
[01:57:58] hundred uh
[01:58:00] doesn't matter
[01:58:02] what world dude I just want to die
[01:58:03] because she's low HP so we'll do like an
[01:58:04] early one
[01:58:05] sure they shouldn't get one-shotted
[01:58:07] right surely this guy doesn't one
[01:58:08] shotter
[01:58:13] error the [ __ ]
[01:58:29] why does not say minus one account shut
[01:58:31] the [ __ ] up
[01:58:33] okay we're gonna start with our Alt
[01:58:41] I just want to use it five times
[01:58:46] hopefully my Auto Battle is off it is
[01:58:50] okay let's try it
[01:58:51] [Music]
[01:58:56] okay so we do skill
[01:59:01] she got [ __ ]
[01:59:05] it's fine
[01:59:09] okay I'm gonna waste the skill point
[01:59:10] we're not playing for damage here we're
[01:59:12] just trying to see if this works so uh I
[01:59:14] I don't care about that hunting skill
[01:59:15] points whatever it's fine
[01:59:21] do this
[01:59:25] they do this
[01:59:27] oh yeah oh we're so dude we are so
[01:59:30] [ __ ] chilling we are so [ __ ]
[01:59:32] chilling
[01:59:34] yeah we also got everyone get hit but
[01:59:36] like
[01:59:37] still look how we have we have like
[01:59:39] extra
[01:59:40] would have been fine even without it no
[01:59:42] we can try again
[01:59:43] excited
[01:59:48] oh and our turn order scuffed
[01:59:55] oh we're gonna kill it [ __ ] we're gonna
[01:59:56] kill her
[02:00:08] enemy targets detected [ __ ]
[02:00:11] don't kill her
[02:00:14] no that hung died oh my God no wait it's
[02:00:18] our turn it's our turn no it's fine it's
[02:00:19] our turn
[02:00:20] yeah we got it okay very pog
[02:00:24] but Mission cogs also I can't even look
[02:00:26] at the [ __ ] weapon
[02:00:28] mashing cogs also
[02:00:32] magic dogs also will give you will give
[02:00:34] you will give you we'll give you eight
[02:00:36] energy when you get hit as well but yeah
[02:00:38] it's one's return but like so if you use
[02:00:40] an attack
[02:00:41] you get eight and then and then and then
[02:00:43] and then and then and then after you get
[02:00:44] hit as well okay so if you get hit so
[02:00:46] actually pretty pog
[02:00:56] wait chat do you think we could get it
[02:00:58] with this too this is 10 err
[02:01:02] I kind of want to try let's try it
[02:01:05] let's cool it cool it
[02:01:11] I'm sorry I'm I'm not normally right now
[02:01:14] I actually don't know what's wrong with
[02:01:15] me
[02:01:23] wrong character
[02:01:31] 's flat energy I know I know it's hot
[02:01:33] energy versus uh 10 error I know but I
[02:01:36] just don't know if like
[02:01:37] despite it not being ate every hit I
[02:01:39] don't know if the 10 is enough or not
[02:01:42] so we might as well just try it effort
[02:01:46] okay we'll give it to the ultra
[02:01:55] okay now we spam Q on our keyboard
[02:01:56] vigorously
[02:02:00] can you guys hear this is it picking it
[02:02:02] up
[02:02:05] oh we have dude we're [ __ ] chilling
[02:02:07] we are so back we are so back
[02:02:13] we are Barack
[02:02:16] you got hit yeah but like ah surely it's
[02:02:19] so fun
[02:02:20] we'll try we'll keep trying we'll keep
[02:02:21] doing it
[02:02:23] we're not playing to win right now I'm
[02:02:25] just trying something
[02:02:32] I'll pay attention to
[02:02:38] um
[02:02:42] I sent a storm
[02:02:45] oh yeah we keep getting hit dude stop
[02:02:48] hitting me okay we'll just let me try
[02:02:50] again because that was actually really
[02:02:52] close
[02:02:52] I think yeah I think we have to get hit
[02:02:54] at least once without meshing [ __ ]
[02:02:58] which I mean tingyun does have a global
[02:03:02] taunt true and real
[02:03:05] um
[02:03:18] to the start that's what we were doing
[02:03:19] we were all together at the start
[02:03:21] oh unless you mean before her turn
[02:03:23] starts yeah you could do that yeah yeah
[02:03:25] that is uh that is a good point you
[02:03:27] could do that
[02:03:27] but I don't really want to do that
[02:03:29] because that excuse the results you got
[02:03:31] me you get me so I'm gonna wait you can
[02:03:33] do that with the asset too I'm pretty
[02:03:34] sure where you insta ass dolls before
[02:03:36] it's even your turn like right now
[02:03:38] but yeah
[02:03:40] um We're not gonna do that
[02:03:51] sorry also
[02:03:52] solo don't hit my thing noon don't hit
[02:03:54] my she got [ __ ] imprisoned we're
[02:03:56] gonna figure
[02:03:57] it's fine I don't care about this guy's
[02:03:58] attack doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[02:03:59] it doesn't matter let me don't hit my
[02:04:02] don't hit my
[02:04:04] oh they actually didn't
[02:04:06] okay no one hit my team you yet okay
[02:04:25] yeah this is gonna be not enough energy
[02:04:28] yeah yeah
[02:04:30] it is close though how much do you have
[02:04:35] yeah we need to get hit we have 114 or
[02:04:37] 130. so I mean
[02:04:44] but
[02:04:47] if we run this like on over meshing cogs
[02:04:49] not only do we get more attack which
[02:04:51] doesn't really matter
[02:04:52] like that much but we also get I mean
[02:04:54] this is better on brania but let's say
[02:04:56] we use it on her we got one skill point
[02:04:59] when we use an ultimate on an ally which
[02:05:01] is a lot
[02:05:02] once every two turns or two ultimates
[02:05:05] that's not every two turns that's every
[02:05:07] like four six turns
[02:05:10] but the 30 more damage is nice but I
[02:05:12] don't even know if our death is going
[02:05:13] she I don't even think he's going right
[02:05:15] after her so we'd have to speed tune
[02:05:16] even more
[02:05:19] although her E1 gives him speed oh my
[02:05:22] God I hate this there's so many things
[02:05:26] okay
[02:05:36] um okay well
[02:05:38] what we I found out what I wanted to
[02:05:41] find out which is
[02:05:42] most people okay everyone has mesh and
[02:05:45] [ __ ] most people don't have this anyways
[02:05:46] and if they do if you do have it you
[02:05:48] probably use it on brania so it's fine
[02:05:49] with that in mind
[02:05:55] wait what if you get this S5
[02:05:58] is S5 [ __ ] does it go from six to uh
[02:06:01] oh it's plus one each level
[02:06:03] ew I mean that's still almost double I
[02:06:07] guess it's no not even
[02:06:09] here we go six seven eight nine ten yeah
[02:06:11] never mind
[02:06:19] yeah that's worse
[02:06:20] okay yeah it's definitely a measuring
[02:06:22] [ __ ] angle then if you want to get it
[02:06:23] every three turns
[02:06:26] but I mean at least it's a free to play
[02:06:27] weapon so we hey we tested we want to
[02:06:29] test so yeah that works if you do
[02:06:30] measuring [ __ ] S5 though where's my S5
[02:06:33] one
[02:06:33] I have an S5 one there it is if you do
[02:06:36] matching [ __ ] S5
[02:06:40] and you have slightly Von whack and you
[02:06:44] have a err rope you can alt every three
[02:06:47] turns on Ting Yoon without using your
[02:06:49] skill more than once
[02:06:51] so you can alt then skill then basic
[02:06:55] attack then basic attack and then alt
[02:06:57] again which means your dad hung should
[02:07:00] be able to alt every three turns as well
[02:07:04] I think we can try that out though but
[02:07:06] it should be
[02:07:08] fine because if you're dead hunk at all
[02:07:10] 33 times then you're bawling
[02:07:18] I'm gonna use this though because I
[02:07:19] don't feel like leveling mesh and cogs
[02:07:30] also the only reason I have to do all of
[02:07:32] this is because
[02:07:34] this Okay the reason I'm doing all of
[02:07:36] this is so that I can include one
[02:07:38] sentence in my video on whether you
[02:07:40] should [ __ ] third normal or second
[02:07:42] normal on him because it's kind of weird
[02:07:44] I don't know I mean you want a third
[02:07:46] normal but like I don't know
[02:07:49] like I hate it okay I'm gonna vent a
[02:07:52] little it's like okay you want to do a
[02:07:53] level three normal but like
[02:07:57] I also feel like most people that are
[02:07:59] playing to you and Aren't gonna do this
[02:08:00] so I'm gonna have to try to be like yo
[02:08:01] do this but it's yeah it's all good
[02:08:05] I want to try to do an actual memory
[02:08:06] Castle Run well we'll get the 10 but
[02:08:08] let's just do six now uh
[02:08:10] uh what was the second half we'll do
[02:08:12] this no this
[02:08:15] what level is my Why is my
[02:08:17] I'm gonna cry
[02:08:21] peel up
[02:08:23] actually silver wolf is better here
[02:08:24] minus one skill point though
[02:08:28] wait I have a teacher
[02:08:36] if my blade really wants the water right
[02:08:39] and my dad hung ill really wants the
[02:08:40] wheelchair right where the [ __ ] do I put

[02:11:20] ad into a honka ad and it'll be like so
[02:11:23] in Fontaine and then I'll Skip and then
[02:11:24] it'll be like just like a random style

[02:12:47] gechen can also be so talented at voice
[02:12:49] acting honestly like if I was a viewer
[02:12:51] of mine I'd be impressed

[02:13:28] [ __ ]
[02:13:31] well it was a it is so Joker that healed
[02:13:35] nothing
[02:13:41] okay I'm not even kidding I think I die
[02:13:43] if I don't do this I don't want to do
[02:13:45] this but I think I actually have to like
[02:13:47] I'm not even kidding
[02:13:48] and then I'll ultimately get hit too
[02:13:50] much
[02:14:03] lover first and foremost also I used to
[02:14:06] play bailu I recently went to Natasha
[02:14:08] because I'm like you know what I might
[02:14:09] as well play Natasha
[02:14:11] um
[02:14:22] consumption too much of a problem uh if
[02:14:24] you're dumb
[02:14:26] no that was toxic it's fine okay it is a
[02:14:29] drawback like you need to be mindful of
[02:14:31] it but if you're like if you know what
[02:14:34] you're doing it's fine if you build a
[02:14:35] team properly it's fine
[02:14:37] I do recognize that sometimes [ __ ] can
[02:14:40] go wrong like it just can you can play
[02:14:42] perfectly but your [ __ ] best friend
[02:14:44] gets detained you get dominated by Kafka
[02:14:46] the [ __ ] ambulance gets called
[02:14:48] [ __ ] you have to use pila's still
[02:14:50] what like it happens so sometimes but
[02:14:52] even if that happens you can just use
[02:14:54] like dead hunk Hills level two normals
[02:14:56] are still pretty good like the combos
[02:14:58] that involve his level two it's still
[02:14:59] fine and then if you can do level three
[02:15:01] to level three so it's fine
[02:15:03] uh let's try to kill the monkey
[02:15:07] almost no okay we're fine
[02:15:16] he thought this seems wholesome but I
[02:15:19] can't read all that I'm sorry my brain I
[02:15:21] I appreciate it
[02:15:24] I have no skill points
[02:15:29] oh [ __ ] she [ __ ] sniped them
[02:15:34] no no I I press Alt
[02:15:40] distance is timely also okay this might
[02:15:43] be a skill issue take but
[02:15:46] you know how I was like yo don't run a
[02:15:47] shield with blade because he wants to
[02:15:48] take damage so it's bad but when I was
[02:15:50] when I was Auto battling when I was Auto
[02:15:53] battling the weekly boss I checked at
[02:15:55] one point and the boss had a one HP and
[02:15:57] only my Lucha was alive and then I lost
[02:15:58] so what I did was I put a [ __ ] shield
[02:16:00] on the team and then I won so yep
[02:16:03] sometimes you gotta Somebody's gotta
[02:16:05] Play Dirty

[02:18:31] are amazing it's still good at easier
[02:18:33] I feel you know forced but E2 is a good
[02:18:35] stopping point it's pretty big

[02:29:30] whatever I mean it is what it is maybe
[02:29:32] it is what it is it is what it is it you
[02:29:36] know sometimes it's not what it's not
[02:29:37] but sometimes it just is what it is and
[02:29:39] this is one of the times where it
[02:29:40] definitely was what it was we're gonna
[02:29:42] give our Natasha uh a little bit a more
[02:29:46] HP
[02:29:47] um just a little bit more so that she's

[02:34:23] lunae
[02:34:26] this team might actually die though I
[02:34:27] guess we're gonna I know we're fine we
[02:34:29] have 12 Cycles we have literally the
[02:34:31] most DPS possible the only way we'd lose
[02:34:34] a star is if taehyun gets [ __ ]
[02:34:36] taunted
[02:34:41] let's win
[02:34:56] foreign
[02:34:57] okay
[02:34:59] we're gonna do this
[02:35:04] then we're gonna
[02:35:06] okay good
[02:35:07] uh uh we'll smack this guy up let's
[02:35:10] settle this
[02:35:18] oh [ __ ] I targeted the wrong dude it
[02:35:20] should still be enough damage copium it
[02:35:23] was not enough damage
[02:35:25] oh yeah it was okay we're fine
[02:35:31] okay nice
[02:35:40] yeah I know this damage is actually
[02:35:41] really good
[02:35:44] okay so we get our alt if we basic
[02:35:47] attack and we get hit if I use my skill
[02:35:49] we don't get her alt but I can't use my
[02:35:51] skill I mean you're not supposed to I
[02:35:54] mean I okay I misspoke everything that I
[02:35:55] said if I basically talk I don't get my
[02:35:57] alter my skill I get it but I'm not
[02:35:59] supposed to use my skill but I kind of
[02:36:00] want to
[02:36:02] uh surely they'll attack me right
[02:36:06] I'm sure they'll attack me
[02:36:07] and Target's detected
[02:36:09] surely you're attacking you in here you
[02:36:11] you chose okay
[02:36:20] I mean it doesn't really matter
[02:36:32] this guy just say Silverman guard bad
[02:36:34] chest like the ad
[02:36:36] that's so cool 200k
[02:36:39] oh
[02:36:41] thanks Dojo [ __ ] it we go again
[02:37:00] thank you
[02:37:02] I sent a storm
[02:37:06] hey why the [ __ ] would Yukon be better
[02:37:08] than Ting Yoon
[02:37:16] why is he destruction I don't [ __ ]
[02:37:18] know I'ma be real
[02:37:29] stay close
[02:37:34] wait what happens
[02:37:38] um
[02:37:49] if I hit him we're gonna get hit
[02:38:01] wait does he counter Splash damage like
[02:38:03] if I hit here yeah right so I should
[02:38:05] probably do it here
[02:38:12] yeah I mean we could probably tank it
[02:38:15] The Witcher could heal us
[02:38:17] ah what's the Worst That Could Happen
[02:38:19] what's the worst that could happen
[02:38:23] yeah the Witch of the chat doesn't
[02:38:24] matter
[02:38:39] do you need to get hit here or not
[02:38:42] should I heal
[02:38:44] I mean we have a field surely don't need
[02:38:46] to heal more than the field right surely
[02:38:48] right surely right
[02:38:53] I have a lot of spare skill points I
[02:38:55] have a lot of spirit skill points it
[02:38:56] doesn't matter
[02:38:58] thank you
[02:39:00] so that was basically two turns
[02:39:06] oh yeah I failed to leave
[02:39:14] nice let me dab Shred
[02:39:17] and then we
[02:39:19] pillow again
[02:39:25] no
[02:39:26] you [ __ ] [ __ ] if you kill my pillow
[02:39:29] I will find you if you kill my pillow I
[02:39:33] will find you I will find you
[02:39:36] okay we're fine I'll see you off
[02:39:49] the strength
[02:39:51] I Really Wanna I really want to hit
[02:39:53] brania but I know that if I do this
[02:39:54] guy's gonna be like
[02:39:57] but we're gonna alt anyways so I might
[02:39:58] as well oh we're gonna get [ __ ] okay
[02:40:00] I'm just gonna be greedy I don't really
[02:40:01] care
[02:40:03] Life's too short to play it safe
[02:40:05] [ __ ] it this isn't life advice this is
[02:40:08] thorough advice true
[02:40:10] uh
[02:40:16] cool
[02:40:25] I don't know why I talk to that guy to
[02:40:27] be honest but it's fine
[02:40:44] you chose The Wrong Enemy
[02:40:48] okay
[02:40:58] foreign
[02:41:01] not bad
[02:41:03] not bad our team is so [ __ ] squishy
[02:41:05] though
[02:41:06] we need to give I actually need to give
[02:41:07] my pillow full HP
[02:41:11] I actually don't see the dude I actually
[02:41:14] did
[02:41:17] wait I'm on
[02:41:22] wrong web
[02:41:29] I mean to be fair that has more HP so
[02:41:31] it's like technically optimal but I
[02:41:33] should I should run yeah this is what I
[02:41:35] want to get uh energy
[02:41:40] [ __ ]
[02:41:44] I won't make it
[02:41:46] tankier as well
[02:41:48] pillow too pillow could run like
[02:41:53] I could go HP on the body if I want like
[02:41:56] I don't really care about the crit rate
[02:41:59] gifting unhp ball yeah I could as well I
[02:42:01] I don't I I did actually I literally did
[02:42:03] it's just plus six and purple
[02:42:10] dude I listen I don't have XP
[02:42:17] catch you next time on the Disney XP
[02:42:19] Channel
[02:42:28] all right let's go get some artifact XP
[02:42:30] what should we what should we Farm what
[02:42:31] should we Farm what should we Farm I'm
[02:42:32] not a dissimulated I'm not a simulate
[02:42:34] some universes right now but we could
[02:42:35] also Farm something that's like that's
[02:42:37] like a normal Relic query domain
[02:42:42] does y'all need peeler can you see what
[02:42:44] else to use someone else
[02:42:45] pillow or is the rule for the two
[02:42:46] thousand Hillary options but you could
[02:42:47] also use uh outside of thinking you
[02:42:49] could use ASA you could use Yukon or you
[02:42:51] could use I don't really like you hung
[02:42:53] though but you could you could use
[02:42:54] [ __ ] uh what's your name uh
[02:42:57] uh what's your name uh uh
[02:42:59] uh uh I forget you use welt please don't
[02:43:02] punish me Mr zayax
[02:43:04] but while this kind of skill point
[02:43:05] hungry too well is he not hungry but he
[02:43:07] wants to use this girl because it's
[02:43:08] pretty good
[02:43:10] it's honestly low-keyed I feel like
[02:43:12] there's not that many characters I mean
[02:43:13] like obviously there's healers like
[02:43:14] Japan and Chile you can use but like in
[02:43:16] terms of just support characters there's
[02:43:17] like five
[02:43:28] huh
[02:43:36] Jafar is basically a Healer you just get
[02:43:37] a fat ass Shield
[02:43:58] all right let's do world seven
[02:44:00] yep seven
[02:44:08] uh because I feel like the all the good
[02:44:11] content in this game I don't like doing
[02:44:12] off stream but I don't stream it enough
[02:44:13] to do all of it so it's like I don't
[02:44:15] know what to do on or I'll stream but I
[02:44:17] auto battled worlds one to six in memory
[02:44:19] chaos offstream so we could just do the
[02:44:21] later ones uh we'll do something we'll
[02:44:22] do a little bit of a universe simulation
[02:44:26] we'll do a very unique team and play uh
[02:44:29] the exact same team as last time but
[02:44:30] instead of Silver Wolf we use Pila
[02:44:32] wow so original
[02:44:34] oh also
[02:44:36] you could use bronia if your bronya is
[02:44:40] E1 and S1 because S1 you get skill point
[02:44:45] E1 you also got skill point
[02:44:48] well fifty percent chance but yeah so E1
[02:44:50] S1 can help
[02:44:58] the average level of your team is lower
[02:44:59] than the recommended level
[02:45:06] also okay I need to know if I'm stupid
[02:45:08] is there actually a reason to ever
[02:45:10] unless like your team Yoon is like
[02:45:11] literally tied to your Jin Yuan and like
[02:45:13] you can't remove her no matter what like
[02:45:15] you asked the tune join my team please
[02:45:16] and she says no [ __ ] you and then her
[02:45:18] neck cracks if outside of that is there
[02:45:20] ever a [ __ ] reason to go yukong over
[02:45:22] her in this team like literally ever
[02:45:24] because you don't get energy like I know
[02:45:26] okay I know the Buffs are pretty good
[02:45:28] but it's like the uptime is ass and then
[02:45:30] you have to skill like you can only
[02:45:31] skill once every two turns you can't
[02:45:33] skill every turn
[02:45:34] uh you also get imaginary damage thanks
[02:45:36] to uh this thing which is 12 and there's
[02:45:39] like
[02:45:41] um
[02:45:44] you go this but like
[02:45:48] unless this is S5 which it might be yeah
[02:45:51] you can get a S5 but unless it's S5 it's
[02:45:54] like 12 okay but like it's not like the
[02:45:57] other Harmony like cones don't already
[02:45:59] give you a lot of damage
[02:46:02] I mean yeah you can probably
[02:46:08] and then to Yoon
[02:46:11] okay wait let me let me let me let me
[02:46:13] let me look at like the passes
[02:46:17] yeah this gives you imaginary like this
[02:46:19] is the nice one
[02:46:21] and then this is a lot of stats but it's
[02:46:23] like
[02:46:33] yeah I mean
[02:46:45] yeah E6 helper helps her but it's like
[02:46:51] yeah E6 helps her a lot and you also get
[02:46:55] some other ones along the way but it's
[02:46:56] like
[02:46:57] I still don't see
[02:47:01] you preferring her over Ting Yoon
[02:47:22] because to you not just will give you
[02:47:23] like similar Buffs
[02:47:29] but she'll like not just give you
[02:47:32] similar Buffs but also give you uh a lot
[02:47:34] of energy which is really important
[02:47:38] and be very very skill point efficient
[02:47:41] like very skill point efficient
[02:47:45] oh you got a jar lucky
[02:47:47] unlucky's Edge
[02:47:52] like and on top of that her base attacks
[02:47:54] aren't really useless because you have
[02:47:55] the the [ __ ] Passover your dude
[02:47:57] attacks alongside you this one
[02:48:01] uh yeah additional lighting damage so
[02:48:03] like it's not like your basic attacks
[02:48:04] are useless at either and it's like
[02:48:06] you're generating skill points and you
[02:48:09] buff once every three turns and you can
[02:48:10] alt pretty reliably and give energy
[02:48:12] every three turns so it's like
[02:48:16] yeah
[02:48:25] wait can you play you can play that hung
[02:48:27] with Dad hung what the [ __ ] I feel like
[02:48:28] this should be banned what if I do dad
[02:48:30] hung dad hung blade and then [ __ ] and
[02:48:33] then like the ultra
[02:48:35] can we clear with this you think what do
[02:48:37] you think
[02:48:38] hahaha
[02:48:40] dude surely we can clear with this
[02:48:43] forbidden team
[02:48:48] wait someone said double that hung
[02:48:50] double bronia wait that is so wait
[02:48:54] no but no no no no we need the we need
[02:48:57] our our Tall Man team
[02:49:13] I feel like we have to cheese it with a
[02:49:14] remembrance no like I feel like we can't
[02:49:16] win with a normal thing
[02:49:24] we actually have the remembrance cheese
[02:49:33] all right let's get a curio
[02:49:36] oh perfect [ __ ] perfect all right we
[02:49:39] got big Lotto
[02:49:43] why the [ __ ] do I have that
[02:49:58] you think there's a special cutscene if
[02:50:01] we clear with this team
[02:50:02] you think they get oiled up
[02:50:13] I think there's a special cutscene we'll
[02:50:15] try it
[02:50:18] dude low-key
[02:50:24] okay I was about to cook something so
[02:50:25] stupid that I'm not even gonna say it
[02:50:30] wait I'm not [ __ ] hunt wait did I
[02:50:32] skip a remembrance Skipper remembrance
[02:50:34] I forgot his remembrance
[02:50:40] no okay good
[02:50:42] dude why am I only getting hunt
[02:50:45] okay
[02:50:49] oh okay you're [ __ ] I I mean we
[02:50:53] should have went hunt I don't know what
[02:50:55] to say I'm actually tilted
[02:51:07] what if okay
[02:51:09] [ __ ] it I'll say it whatever okay
[02:51:11] whatever hear me out right
[02:51:14] in Bible or lunae okay sure
[02:51:17] then
[02:51:19] okay
[02:51:21] all right that's a good basis all right
[02:51:24] now usually you'd put like Pila right
[02:51:26] okay
[02:51:31] people like pillow right okay silver
[02:51:32] wolf
[02:51:35] what if what if we put what if we put
[02:51:38] what if we what if we play a three-man
[02:51:40] team and then the fourth slot we just
[02:51:42] bring blade for fun because like yeah
[02:51:44] for fun he just wants to be there and
[02:51:46] then like yeah he'll eat a skill point
[02:51:47] but then after that he doesn't
[02:51:53] emotional decluttering
[02:52:04] he also doesn't generate skill points
[02:52:06] okay true but what if you don't skill on
[02:52:07] blade what if you'd only normal attack
[02:52:09] and don't even what if you don't press e
[02:52:16] think about it think about it think
[02:52:18] about it let me cook
[02:52:22] should I jump nah I mean nah but what if
[02:52:25] we
[02:52:29] our team is actually so bad we can't our
[02:52:31] team is literally too bad to even Gamba
[02:52:39] okay well
[02:52:46] let's wait
[02:52:52] yeah then you can go full attack blade
[02:53:01] don't get complacent okay so we do this
[02:53:07] first
[02:53:18] the truth of life
[02:53:25] this is certainly a team
[02:53:31] no look we're actually we have skill
[02:53:32] points we're chilling look at this look
[02:53:34] at how many skill points we have we're
[02:53:36] chilling
[02:53:40] I will dispatch
[02:53:43] blade not giving us skill points is so
[02:53:46] sad
[02:53:58] but I mean this is literally fine
[02:54:04] this is fine we're actually fine we're
[02:54:07] literally fine
[02:54:15] you chose
[02:54:19] okay related too
[02:54:24] wait did I have a stat oh I had stocks
[02:54:27] wait we're actually chilling we're
[02:54:29] chilling
[02:54:41] now do it without the wheelchair I am
[02:54:43] never doing anything about the ultra
[02:54:45] actually the best pull I've ever done
[02:54:47] ever in any game Lucha is so stupid dude
[02:54:50] he is so broken he is actually the best
[02:54:52] pull he's so good I don't care I don't
[02:54:54] give a [ __ ] about silver wolf enjoyers I
[02:54:56] don't give a [ __ ] I I love blade I don't
[02:54:58] care Lucha is so [ __ ] stupid I'm also
[02:55:00] I don't have a drip hard so I I actually
[02:55:04] the best addition to my account
[02:55:08] but yeah I know fuschwan is next so
[02:55:11] maybe she'll maybe she'll be very pogged
[02:55:13] but Lewis is stupid man he's so good
[02:55:17] uh dissociation's really good we'll do
[02:55:20] this one I guess no actually Frozen
[02:55:21] because
[02:55:34] although remembers blessings are nice to
[02:55:36] be upgraded so the damage doesn't matter
[02:55:37] but it's okay
[02:55:39] Quantum okay
[02:55:41] physical
[02:55:49] oh Society ticket oh Wick wait that was
[02:55:53] cracked dude if there's a lesson to be
[02:55:56] learned it's always picked a lotto
[02:55:58] ticket
[02:55:59] oh I gotta stop spending my [ __ ]
[02:56:00] money dude yeah I will do this I
[02:56:02] actually need money

[02:56:22] um okay so we're gonna do okay ha ha
[02:56:24] hahaha
[02:56:27] seven search on the battle while I pull
[02:56:31] something up it's like
[02:56:53] the strength
[02:56:58] scared
[02:57:01] [Music]
[02:57:02] no
[02:57:04] why somebody else
[02:57:09] no
[02:57:11] okay yo
[02:57:14] why does water not he doesn't even move
[02:57:17] at least Dash forward
[02:57:32] um
[02:57:33] well this hits seven times at least
[02:57:38] foreign
[02:58:02] hi hello you mean to tell me that you
[02:58:03] can have two dead hungs oh my God that's
[02:58:05] cool first time chat see this is
[02:58:07] literally the reason why we played this
[02:58:08] team
[02:58:10] only for the
[02:58:13] this is a lore team
[02:58:15] I accept the watch I guess but you chose
[02:58:17] to wait he's tall surely there's lore in
[02:58:19] that
[02:58:29] [ __ ] please don't oh whatever
[02:58:35] the only thing I don't like about the
[02:58:37] Roadshow and this is just like the most
[02:58:38] like first world problem thing where
[02:58:40] it's like it's not even a bad thing it's
[02:58:42] just I don't like how when the fight is
[02:58:44] won and I know I'm about to win Lewis
[02:58:46] decides to take like he'll take like
[02:58:48] four turns like heal someone and then
[02:58:50] it'll put a field down and then his alt
[02:58:51] will take like six years and then it's
[02:58:52] just
[02:58:53] but it doesn't matter like it's not a
[02:58:55] bad thing it's just like sometimes I
[02:58:56] just want to like just let me play the
[02:58:58] game man
[02:58:59] that's all
[02:59:01] look at this
[02:59:10] how much better is like a compared to
[02:59:12] hurt as S5 for Den Hong I think
[02:59:16] I think it's so it should be around 10
[02:59:19] ish percent
[02:59:22] like five to ten well around 10. the
[02:59:25] only thing is
[02:59:27] well five to ten
[02:59:29] the only thing is it's like
[02:59:33] which would me okay if it's just five to
[02:59:34] ten better then it's not a good icon to
[02:59:36] get but I think the like nice part is
[02:59:40] the energy it gives you makes it kind of
[02:59:42] comfy do I still recommend getting it no
[02:59:43] but the energy gives you can be nice
[02:59:45] especially if like you're not [ __ ]
[02:59:47] alting every three turns on Ting Yoon or
[02:59:50] if you're not
[02:59:51] running like like the most efficient
[02:59:54] team
[02:59:54] that's nice
[02:59:57] why not blades icon
[03:00:02] 80 crit right okay that's good increases
[03:00:05] the max HP by 18 when the wear is
[03:00:08] attacked or consumes HP their damage
[03:00:10] increases by 24. so I mean do you want
[03:00:12] to taunt him I mean you could taunt like
[03:00:14] I you could like okay here's here's how
[03:00:17] you play you put this on on that hung
[03:00:19] right then you put a fire emcee next to
[03:00:22] him then you talked on fire EMC the
[03:00:25] splash damage hits you you get 24 damage
[03:00:31] true
[03:00:36] how much difference does 10 er do it's
[03:00:38] quite it's decent like I can alt every
[03:00:41] three turns with my dad hung ill with
[03:00:43] Ting you but I've also seen people say
[03:00:46] like this is something that I literally
[03:00:48] cannot test even if I want to
[03:00:50] um so I'm taking word for it
[03:00:53] where it's like if you have Ting Yoon E6
[03:00:56] and you Alt
[03:00:59] uh and you're on a full energy build and
[03:01:01] you spam Alt you can two turn Alt
[03:01:04] with lycone
[03:01:06] even without ER R rope
[03:01:08] so which is really good because then you
[03:01:10] save skill points you do more damage but
[03:01:11] even if you can't you should still be
[03:01:13] able to three turn Alt
[03:01:15] so like it's fine it's just pretty good
[03:01:17] overall and you can usually it makes it
[03:01:19] to where you can spam your third normal
[03:01:21] attack Without Really um
[03:01:27] without really needing to think whereas
[03:01:29] at e0 like without his signature
[03:01:32] uh you need to think a little
[03:01:43] you can try it just swipe
[03:01:45] I also don't have e16 units
[03:01:53] but I could look a bit more into it
[03:02:02] you chose The Wrong Enemy
[03:02:17] can you make a guide yeah
[03:02:47] kill

[03:12:30] all right cool
[03:12:35] well
[03:12:36] that was fun that was that was cool
[03:12:41] at least we can now
[03:12:44] refine our weapon
[03:12:46] superimpose it I almost bought a [ __ ]
[03:12:48] single pole
[03:12:57] wait did I
[03:12:58] I guess I didn't really look at the Rope
[03:13:00] yeah let me go look at it
[03:13:02] uh where are the ropes we got
[03:13:08] skipped it
[03:13:14] I mean double flat start but crit rate
[03:13:17] might get crit damage I guess
[03:13:20] can't be too picky
[03:13:25] dumb I heard a like comes even good yes
[03:13:27] they're really good
[03:13:56] yeah we need to superimpose it
[03:14:01] yeah this looks pretty good
[03:14:05] they are pretty cracked
[03:14:11] okay I wish I know
[03:14:12] let me Auto Battle something while I
[03:14:14] think let's do um
[03:14:15] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:14:20] it's probably events I didn't check yet
[03:14:35] look guys imaginary resistant
[03:14:39] uh
[03:14:41] uh let's do it's the last one
[03:14:43] actually let's do this one
[03:14:46] surely this guy's not imaginary
[03:14:48] assistant no he's not all right
[03:14:58] all right
[03:15:03] not this domain oh no wait what the [ __ ]
[03:15:06] is wrong with this domain literally what
[03:15:08] the [ __ ] is wrong with it
[03:15:14] what is wrong with this domain
[03:15:17] repay
[03:15:25] yes really good for pillow
[03:15:30] it helps with your app timer out
[03:15:41] appreciate it
[03:15:55] although that was actually kind of
[03:15:57] popping off
[03:16:01] unless we don't use skill hunting in but
[03:16:03] I think it will
[03:16:13] the head returned
[03:16:19] so we're going for his icon I'm on
[03:16:21] Guarantee
[03:16:22] um
[03:16:25] that's a tough nut to crack
[03:16:29] if he's like your favorite character
[03:16:31] then probably like maybe but if not no
[03:16:36] like if you already have a good option
[03:16:38] then you could save your guarantee for
[03:16:40] whoever you want
[03:16:42] but like it is pretty decent so
[03:16:48] he's literally chained up wait is he
[03:16:53] I guess I could examine it further let's
[03:16:55] see
[03:17:00] okay I mean dudes I mean
[03:17:12] dude you don't even see light cones on
[03:17:14] characters when you attack
[03:17:16] it's not like it's not like it's like a
[03:17:17] weapon and you see it
[03:17:19] I can't even zoom in on it
[03:17:21] can I zoom out in the archive
[03:17:30] Zedge
[03:17:47] when the guide out it should be out
[03:17:49] tomorrow so I recorded most of it the
[03:17:52] only things I need to re or that I
[03:17:53] needed to add is I didn't
[03:17:55] uh I didn't know what the [ __ ] the
[03:17:57] technique did so I didn't I didn't
[03:17:58] record that yet and I didn't record
[03:18:00] um some of the combo like the like
[03:18:02] rotation part because it's well like I
[03:18:05] kind of did but it's really weird where
[03:18:07] it's like what you should be doing and
[03:18:09] what you're gonna be doing are different
[03:18:10] because like
[03:18:14] you can spam your level three normal
[03:18:17] every turn with this team if you don't
[03:18:19] ever use a skill on anyone other than
[03:18:21] Ting Yoon ever but it's like you're
[03:18:23] probably gonna need to so it's like
[03:18:24] there's like a lot of weird [ __ ] and
[03:18:25] then it depends on your team that
[03:18:26] depends on your light code and then if
[03:18:28] your team Yoon is on uh meshing [ __ ]
[03:18:30] and also uh this two-piece and also
[03:18:33] um whether or not she's on E6 will
[03:18:35] change how the [ __ ] you put I don't know
[03:18:36] it's like
[03:18:38] I feel like I'm trying to find a way to
[03:18:40] word it without making the video 64
[03:18:42] minutes long but also without someone
[03:18:44] being mad at me for missing something so
[03:18:45] I'm trying to like be as deep I'm trying
[03:18:47] to figure out how to word it but I can't
[03:18:49] I think I kind of figured it out so I'll
[03:18:51] try to word it correctly
[03:18:56] your streams go hard minimized and muted
[03:18:59] okay
[03:19:01] foreign
[03:19:04] yeah like basically you want to try to
[03:19:07] do three normals but [ __ ] can happen and
[03:19:09] also another rotation that isn't bad is
[03:19:12] two normals a few times and then a three
[03:19:15] normal example like if you if you have
[03:19:17] the burst every four turns let's say you
[03:19:19] don't have to noon you could do N2 and
[03:19:21] or like level two level two level two
[03:19:23] and then level three or level three then
[03:19:25] two two two two which is fine it's not
[03:19:27] that much worse and it's better than
[03:19:29] going in ER rope
[03:19:32] um
[03:19:32] I'm pretty sure
[03:19:37] it's just like
[03:19:39] I'm trying to figure out how to work
[03:19:40] like I I have recorded already but it's
[03:19:42] like 10 minutes of a section so I'm
[03:19:44] trying to see if I can make it shorter
[03:19:46] uh but I would hate myself if I cut
[03:19:47] something out that I wanted to say so
[03:19:49] I'm trying to not
[03:19:53] but yeah
[03:20:05] well done silver for pretty different
[03:20:07] roles I know they're both in a Hillary
[03:20:09] but like silver wolf is more of like
[03:20:11] straight up defense production debuffer
[03:20:13] type of thing also implant weakness weld
[03:20:15] is pretty good but he's more of like a
[03:20:17] kind of sub DPS like yeah he did like
[03:20:19] slow enemies and [ __ ] but it's a little
[03:20:21] bit different
[03:20:22] um I think he's good
[03:20:27] why does farming for Speed boots feel
[03:20:28] like farming for an em goblet dude it
[03:20:30] actually does
[03:20:33] it actually does
[03:20:41] official guy to win right after the dad
[03:20:43] hung ill guide It's that one's done as
[03:20:45] well the only thing I don't have is the
[03:20:46] visuals because I don't have a good
[03:20:47] [ __ ] Golden Corral set but it's fine
[03:21:08] no I'm not even kidding I before I
[03:21:10] started this stream my dad hung's boots
[03:21:11] were a [ __ ] four star I just got this
[03:21:13] like now we were literally using four
[03:21:15] star boots every other piece this looks
[03:21:17] amazing this is amazing this is amazing
[03:21:19] and then wrong two piece but it's fine
[03:21:21] this is really good this is really good
[03:21:23] and then we have this it's like [ __ ]
[03:21:24] seven crit rate wow yes I love my speed
[03:21:27] boots
[03:21:30] I have to steal for my silly and my
[03:21:32] yanching though before yancheng this guy
[03:21:34] I mean it's only one piece even without
[03:21:35] it you know we're still chilling
[03:21:38] Sage we don't talk about a genuine yeah
[03:21:40] this guy I mean I love him but like yeah
[03:21:42] we don't talk about him sorry man
[03:21:45] what ratio Z71 158 but we also getting
[03:21:48] five percent crit rate from a trace I
[03:21:50] don't have yet so we're gonna gain five
[03:21:51] which is pretty good like 76 ish or
[03:21:54] it'll be like closer to 77. uh 158
[03:21:57] pretty good
[03:21:59] pretty good
[03:22:11] Sino effect I did not bench Sino I did
[03:22:16] not bench side of my genuine just has
[03:22:18] terrible relics all of my luck on him
[03:22:20] are bad the only light cone of his I
[03:22:22] have is [ __ ] uh himachos I have
[03:22:25] himako's lycone it's like the only it's
[03:22:27] the only use dude
[03:22:32] foreign
[03:22:42] just use breakfast I mean yeah but I'd
[03:22:44] have to fully superimpose it and then
[03:22:46] level it and it's also not even always
[03:22:49] better like
[03:22:51] like himoko's icon is bad but it's still
[03:22:54] because of the base that's still like
[03:22:55] usable it's just it feels like [ __ ]
[03:23:10] yeah I could also get the bow dude
[03:23:13] I mean I guess I have other ones now
[03:23:15] like I could also get the battle pass
[03:23:16] one
[03:23:19] I think it's also because it doesn't
[03:23:20] give me crit because it doesn't give me
[03:23:22] crit
[03:23:23] my ratio looks terrible which has
[03:23:26] demotivated me because you guys would
[03:23:27] make fun of me for it it's not even that
[03:23:29] he's bad it's that you guys would be
[03:23:30] like oh envies is better and then I'm
[03:23:32] just like okay well and then
[03:23:35] we just got this too this could be good
[03:23:36] you know
[03:23:38] oh yeah I also don't have a lightning
[03:23:39] ball that that was the biggest thing I
[03:23:40] forgot about that I don't have a
[03:23:42] lightning ball
[03:23:43] look I have a imaginary one I have a
[03:23:46] grade wind one I have a great ice one
[03:23:48] you know uh um um um um a decent Quantum
[03:23:52] honestly you know oh I guess I have
[03:23:54] space filling station but yeah I don't
[03:23:56] know
[03:23:58] I don't know man
[03:24:04] my best inertia soda one is this which I
[03:24:07] mean you know it's only plus 12 like I
[03:24:09] might get you know another roll
[03:24:15] foreign
[03:24:20] I would use that okay but
[03:24:25] I'm saying like my it's okay
[03:24:28] I just like all my other characters are
[03:24:30] so much better my dad hung amazing my my
[03:24:33] Kafka stunning my Sealy gorgeous my
[03:24:37] blade Perfection although Seeley looks
[03:24:39] bad now because I took some of her
[03:24:40] relics but I promise her build is
[03:24:41] usually good blade perfect
[03:24:44] silver wolf time for about okay I don't
[03:24:47] know why that's on her but you know what
[03:24:48] I mean usually time for a bug
[03:24:52] cracked
[03:24:55] my Blade's actually so good though I'm
[03:24:57] actually proud of my blade I love blade
[03:25:00] okay this piece sucks but every I mean
[03:25:02] this is even about HP speed crit it's
[03:25:03] actually good I lied this piece actually
[03:25:06] is so beautiful you could frame it next
[03:25:07] to the Mona Lisa and people wouldn't
[03:25:09] even know which is the more valuable
[03:25:10] piece circlet
[03:25:14] boots pretty nice 22 damage we need that
[03:25:16] ball yes sir every subset is usable and
[03:25:20] and and and and and and and and we also
[03:25:23] have we also have another one
[03:25:26] um on a different set in case I need it
[03:25:27] I think but do I have another window
[03:25:28] inside but this is still a really good
[03:25:30] ball and boom this is probably one of
[03:25:32] our worst pieces too but you know 16 of
[03:25:34] credit we take it
[03:25:37] our worst piece is this but like it is
[03:25:40] what it is
[03:25:45] do I have a damaged body that I've
[03:25:47] locked
[03:25:49] um no I mean like this could roll crit
[03:25:51] rate I guess
[03:25:59] okay
[03:26:03] well whatever it's only one you know
[03:26:05] it's still really good it is
[03:26:13] okay he's too down on the same team yes
[03:26:15] you can use this with you
[03:26:24] bro your speed onto a blade we're using
[03:26:26] uh blade brania
[03:26:28] I know you could do like turbo amounts
[03:26:30] of speed on both of them but it's fine
[03:26:31] we still go twice
[03:26:32] with that hung we want one three four
[03:26:34] right one three three but I don't know
[03:26:35] if there's like a decimal point where we
[03:26:37] have enough because there's no way to
[03:26:38] check unless you try it I'm pretty sure
[03:26:40] so we have to try it
[03:26:42] but yeah
[03:27:00] point one
[03:27:12] three four for two turns uh per cycle in
[03:27:17] yeah two different cycle things like
[03:27:18] memory chaos and stuff you just get to
[03:27:19] go more like speed in general lets you
[03:27:21] go more and stuff but then a 134 is a
[03:27:22] break point to be able to go twice
[03:27:25] before
[03:27:27] um
[03:27:33] cycle
[03:27:37] so they went through five asses on team
[03:27:38] now I mean I also gives you more speed
[03:27:42] yeah yeah for first cycle
[03:27:45] there's other speed break points for
[03:27:47] like other
[03:27:50] there's other speed breakdowns for like
[03:27:51] other cycles and stuff
[03:27:54] there's a lot
[03:27:56] um
[03:27:59] I would check the chicken means for that
[03:28:01] but also if you're playing bronya well
[03:28:03] not okay well Brony gives you an extra
[03:28:05] turn so
[03:28:06] um
[03:28:07] you can run either both high speed or
[03:28:09] both low speed but if you're running
[03:28:12] acid you also get a lot of speed so
[03:28:14] usually don't do like attack
[03:28:27] yeah I'm pretty sure there's a kaching
[03:28:29] Mains page with all of the breakpoints
[03:28:30] if you guys care about them I can try to
[03:28:32] pull it up
[03:28:33] because I remember I like I've
[03:28:34] definitely seen it but I kind of forget
[03:28:52] okay
[03:28:53] let's go do
[03:28:56] I actually don't know what I'm gonna do
[03:28:59] hmm
[03:29:05] I Got YouTube running instead of
[03:29:06] downtown hey keep pulling hey hey keep
[03:29:09] sorry
[03:29:11] good luck
[03:29:13] you think we could Auto Battle this boss
[03:29:15] we can try
[03:29:17] wait I don't need to do this one let's
[03:29:18] do the new one
[03:29:22] I actually might pull for his light cone
[03:29:24] but I haven't decided so I don't want to
[03:29:25] do it today because that would be
[03:29:26] impulse impulsivity
[03:29:34] you're gonna do with this team I feel
[03:29:36] like we're gonna get like destroyed
[03:29:39] [ __ ] it
[03:29:56] yeah I'm not sure
[03:29:59] um
[03:30:07] thank you
[03:30:13] um I'm just throwing stuff down I think
[03:30:17] oh wait we can dude why does Genji not
[03:30:20] let us change the music mid fight
[03:30:21] because like whenever I do a boss on the
[03:30:22] turn I just realized like oh should I
[03:30:24] can do this in this game why can't I do
[03:30:25] this in [ __ ] gention this is so sick
[03:30:34] foreign
[03:30:49] settings no not in uh abyss and not in
[03:30:53] domains
[03:30:56] so like let's say I'm fighting like
[03:30:59] Scara
[03:31:00] and I'm like oh [ __ ] I want to hear uh
[03:31:02] what's his name uh uh uh uh you paying
[03:31:05] Chen singing humming in my ears you
[03:31:08] can't it says leave battle leave domain
[03:31:22] sorry I'm not gonna ruin the song I
[03:31:24] won't ruin this for you guys
[03:31:28] I think the only thing is left for the
[03:31:30] guide are
[03:31:32] um
[03:31:33] the like advanced stuff that I haven't
[03:31:35] recorded where it's like
[03:31:42] I mean honestly I've done most of it but
[03:31:44] I need to figure out
[03:31:47] because I I don't know
[03:31:52] whoa
[03:31:54] I need to figure out if people are
[03:31:55] actually gonna be doing like three two
[03:31:56] two or not or if that's just like a myth
[03:31:59] in urban legends
[03:32:03] what am I feel a die
[03:32:10] well this is a riboso maybe we don't
[03:32:12] Auto Battle
[03:32:15] honestly we might still win which is
[03:32:16] kind of a chad
[03:32:27] [Music]
[03:32:33] [Music]
[03:32:36] well
[03:32:38] it's fine we still win we still win we
[03:32:41] literally still win
[03:32:47] okay no we don't
[03:32:50] hey at least at least at least at least
[03:32:53] at least it was close at least it was
[03:32:55] close
[03:32:56] at least I was close I just blame Auto
[03:32:59] Battle well I just don't say lore
[03:33:01] accurate that was not lower accurate
[03:33:05] okay well um maybe I should just
[03:33:07] manually play or or maybe bench peel up
[03:33:09] Pila died really fast
[03:33:11] honestly
[03:33:16] just do this
[03:33:17] I think blade actually just tanks it
[03:33:20] even though you're not really supposed
[03:33:21] to play blade in this team I think he
[03:33:22] just tanks it
[03:33:27] don't kill her at second phase you just
[03:33:29] want to listen to the [ __ ] music
[03:33:35] mods can we add a band Turman chat

[03:33:41] like anytime someone types use Japan it
[03:33:43] would be better if they just weren't
[03:33:44] able to type
[03:33:51] why do you type mod check you're a mod

[03:36:47] better late than never
[03:37:03] dude peel is better than blade here
[03:37:20] [Music]
[03:37:24] welcome
[03:37:25] a thousand
[03:37:26] [Music]
[03:37:30] all right we do it
[03:37:38] okay
[03:37:40] okay I mean
[03:37:48] I just got loose and Afterglow
[03:37:55] foreign
[03:38:09] I feel like Blade's more AOE I know
[03:38:11] blade also has like mostly adjacent
[03:38:13] stuff but his past have also just [ __ ]
[03:38:15] everyone up and his damage feels a bit
[03:38:17] more AOE than um
[03:38:19] Mr Ill Bill also has like adjacent
[03:38:22] damage on some hits but it's not on
[03:38:23] every hit
[03:38:25] um and it feels like less
[03:38:27] [Music]
[03:38:32] Elmore AOE I mean depends how many
[03:38:34] enemies you're fighting I mean usually
[03:38:35] you're only fighting three but doesn't
[03:38:37] blade
[03:38:38] um so blade slice look we can look at it
[03:38:43] we can look at it blade slice is
[03:38:45] um where's the follow-up attack
[03:38:47] the [ __ ] is follow-up attack skill oh
[03:38:49] it's Talent yeah so it's foreign and
[03:38:54] then the other attacks are um where does
[03:38:57] it say here yeah big hit and then
[03:38:59] smaller for adjacent and then same with
[03:39:01] Alt
[03:39:02] this guy is similar uh alt is the same
[03:39:05] it's one big hit and then adjacent and
[03:39:07] then the other ones it's um
[03:39:09] where is it it's on basic right yeah
[03:39:11] it's
[03:39:12] from the fourth hit onward it does
[03:39:14] adjacent which like yeah it'll still be
[03:39:16] a lot of damage
[03:39:18] um or five like a fifth hit on a fourth
[03:39:21] hit honor is if it's second as well
[03:39:24] uh and then ultimate is also adjacent so
[03:39:26] it's like if you're fighting like five
[03:39:27] things blades town will hit all of them
[03:39:29] but usually you're not fighting five
[03:39:31] you're just one or three so like it you
[03:39:33] know but blade does feel more AOE I
[03:39:35] don't know maybe maybe it's just like
[03:39:37] copium but
[03:39:39] Papa
[03:39:45] this guy does that really good single
[03:39:46] Target though on top of his adjacent
[03:39:48] [ __ ]
[03:39:50] that dragon is really cool
[03:39:53] dude did you guys see the new [ __ ]
[03:39:54] valorant gun finisher it literally is
[03:39:57] the dragon from Star rail they just copy
[03:39:59] pasted it I am not even kidding by the
[03:40:01] way I am literally not kidding look
[03:40:12] low-key copyright infringement all good
[03:40:15] it's actually pretty dude look literally
[03:40:17] look
[03:40:22] it's literally like there's a white one
[03:40:24] too this one's black but there's a white
[03:40:26] one oh I don't know where it is let me
[03:40:28] pull up the white one
[03:40:32] I [ __ ] clicked on every dude
[03:40:35] where is it rise of the Dragon Kings
[03:40:45] let me pull it up
[03:40:48] oh here it is look
[03:40:52] look
[03:40:54] dude it's literally the same [ __ ]
[03:40:57] it's his dragon
[03:41:01] star rail invented dragons true okay no
[03:41:03] I'm I know I know it's it's probably
[03:41:05] it's not
[03:41:06] I I know okay I get it it's it's [ __ ]
[03:41:11] IRL lore okay but I'm just saying it
[03:41:14] looks like [ __ ] Dan hung uh Dan hung
[03:41:16] ill as a bundle
[03:41:18] I Loki kind of want it now
[03:41:24] the dragon's true
[03:41:30] they all copied Hanzo anyways okay true
[03:41:33] that is that is a good point
[03:41:38] where's your coffee I finished it I made
[03:41:40] a cappuccino
[03:41:42] it is done
[03:41:47] wait so now because I showed that on
[03:41:49] stream if I buy the bundle it's a
[03:41:51] business expense right true so I can
[03:41:52] deduct true real okay all right well I
[03:41:55] don't even like the skin but I like the
[03:41:56] finisher so maybe I have to I kind of
[03:41:58] have to for him even if I don't like it
[03:41:59] I don't know
[03:42:02] dude it's a bit it's business it's a
[03:42:05] business expense it's my brand I need to
[03:42:12] okay
[03:42:14] it's an investment

[03:42:53] shot um it's gonna be I won't I'll have
[03:42:55] to close Chad for my mental
[03:43:04] foreign
[03:43:13] just don't miss it's that simple okay
[03:43:15] that is that is a fair point

[03:44:20] now I'm not saying you have to use it
[03:44:23] I'm just saying
[03:44:25] there is a light cone you could use
[03:44:27] that's all I'm saying I'm not advocating
[03:44:29] for it I'm just saying
[03:44:39] waiting is dead as [ __ ]

[03:45:35] like it could be useful but
[03:45:38] I feel like okay what if I told you that
[03:45:40] the reason I know is
[03:45:43] what if I told you that the reason I
[03:45:45] know right
[03:45:46] is is is is is is okay how do I say this
[03:45:50] so you guys don't judge me what if the
[03:45:51] reason why I know it is like
[03:45:54] like business expenses like like like
[03:45:56] um like characters

[03:46:21] created right one two three four but if
[03:46:24] you hold W look you can create them
[03:46:26] faster one two three wait it looks the
[03:46:28] same I swear it's faster
[03:46:30] wait is it I actually don't even know
[03:46:32] anymore
[03:46:32] one two three four five wait let's do it
[03:46:36] without it one two three ah okay maybe
[03:46:39] not I actually don't know
[03:46:41] it's faster on some characters I don't
[03:46:43] know I felt like sometimes it was faster
[03:46:44] why was it wait
[03:46:47] there was faster wait what the [ __ ] is
[03:46:49] happening
[03:46:51] they changed it at 1.1 did they

[03:54:14] the important parts and then the rest
[03:54:15] you just read fast
[03:54:17] like you read everything that's not that
[03:54:19] doesn't seem important fast and then
[03:54:20] what's important you read like a new
[03:54:21] highlight and you take notes that's not
[03:54:24] motivation though it still sucks it's
[03:54:25] gonna be [ __ ] annoying and boring but
[03:54:27] hey
[03:54:30] I don't have a good work methodology
[03:54:32] though I like turbo grind to the point
[03:54:34] where I hate myself and then I turbo
[03:54:36] procrastinate and then I alternate so
[03:54:38] like example
[03:54:40] I'll like do I literally slept all day
[03:54:42] then I woke up at like 8 p.m and then I
[03:54:44] or no not 8pm I mean I guess I I stayed
[03:54:47] up to like seven yesterday working so

[03:54:49] quote-unquote but like recording but I
[03:54:52] don't know like I'll like I like I don't
[03:54:54] know I like procrastinate for like a day
[03:54:56] like a day and they'll be like damn I
[03:54:58] shouldn't have procrastinated and then
[03:54:59] I'll just like be more efficient than I

[03:58:12] dragon
[03:58:14] these nuts I don't say it weird
[03:58:29] yeah I mean I think
[03:58:30] yeah I did like I wanna I don't know
[03:58:33] what to do because it's like I want to
[03:58:35] play more but I also need to edit so I
[03:58:38] don't know I'll see what I do I'm pretty
[03:58:40] sure I've finished recording everything
[03:58:42] uh except
[03:58:47] um
[03:58:48] it's not the combo part
[03:58:50] of the switches on your keyboard these
[03:58:51] ones are pink but I used to have gator
[03:58:52] on black inks that are lubed and I use a
[03:58:55] G Pro super light
[03:58:57] for my mouse
[03:59:15] you want our light cone low key neither
[03:59:17] is e0 E2 I mean it's just pretty like E1
[03:59:21] is like E1 is okay it's not like bad but
[03:59:24] it's definitely a stepping stone for E2
[03:59:25] so like
[03:59:31] um
[03:59:32] yeah E2 is really really good
[03:59:35] which is really really good
[03:59:49] another E2 bait I mean yeah it's also
[03:59:52] like don't you know don't be like oh my
[03:59:54] God I need it like I got E2 Ryden and I
[03:59:56] rarely [ __ ] use it so it's like
[03:59:58] you know
[04:00:00] if you want it it's good but like you
[04:00:03] don't need it
[04:00:07] it's all yours
[04:00:18] I said E2 righted dude okay why are the
[04:00:22] same things have different names
[04:00:25] what dude e and C are the same thing
[04:00:29] I'm done
[04:00:36] I know they're different games but
[04:00:37] they're made by the same dude it's the
[04:00:39] same I'm done I'm done
[04:00:41] Matt I have to change my whole
[04:00:43] vocabulary to start saying a Nemo
[04:00:45] instead of wind I go outside damn it's
[04:00:46] very animaley today and then this game
[04:00:49] is like oh no [ __ ] you it's wind again
[04:01:07] the consequences
[04:01:08] leaping dragon
[04:01:12] dude you can go so hecking far with this
[04:01:18] I'm also record it actually I haven't
[04:01:19] talked about the technique in my thing
[04:01:21] yet
[04:01:24] we're gonna Dash till we find an enemy
[04:01:33] is there an enemy anywhere
[04:01:36] dude
[04:01:38] bro they're in [ __ ] Narnia
[04:01:46] found one
[04:01:49] there you go
[04:01:55] foreign
[04:02:10] you are right that is correct
[04:02:15] let me say that clip one sec
[04:02:30] [ __ ]
[04:02:38] I mean he also Jiggles a little
[04:02:41] respectfully respectfully it's not like
[04:02:43] as much as blade but hey it's more of
[04:02:45] just like a a movement
[04:02:48] I mean
[04:02:59] okay dude yeah I mean this is more yeah
[04:03:05] respectfully
[04:03:08] but then you look at blade
[04:03:13] I can't even there it is
[04:03:16] I don't know
[04:03:28] yeah they made up new physics
[04:03:32] okay uh I'll get a dead shot
[04:03:36] okay is there anything wait is there
[04:03:38] anything I need to do more
[04:03:40] okay wait let me recap this stuff really
[04:03:43] fast
[04:03:44] okay I'm gonna recap some things so
[04:03:48] and three is optimal but some weird
[04:03:49] teams no not not even weird a lot of
[04:03:51] teams also have to end too and it's okay
[04:03:53] if you have 10 too
[04:03:57] all town and skill are basically just
[04:03:59] like these two are just [ __ ] Buffs
[04:04:00] and then this one is just
[04:04:02] um adjacent and it gives you two skill
[04:04:03] points
[04:04:05] lycoms are pretty straightforward relics
[04:04:07] are also pretty straightforward
[04:04:09] uh his e2s cracked his E6 is cracked
[04:04:16] yeah yeah like N2 is normal like doing
[04:04:18] two two two three or just two two three
[04:04:22] or like three two three like a lot of
[04:04:24] people might have to do if you need to
[04:04:26] heal or if you need to like cleanse or
[04:04:28] like debuff an enemy like like whatever
[04:04:30] the f like there's a lot of times where
[04:04:32] you might intend to I also think this is
[04:04:34] very copium but I think that like
[04:04:36] if you're not gonna
[04:04:38] n three or N2 you could do like a zero
[04:04:41] like a no charges if you're just
[04:04:42] finishing an enemy off or you have like
[04:04:43] no [ __ ] skill points and you're
[04:04:44] waiting but doing the the one charge
[04:04:47] seems very like kind of bad
[04:04:50] um
[04:04:51] because you just don't like you lose a
[04:04:52] skill point
[04:04:54] um
[04:04:56] I think to you this is best support by
[04:04:58] far
[04:04:59] uh and you can always three turn off
[04:05:01] with her after doing skill basic basic
[04:05:03] if you have meshing cogs Von walk and
[04:05:06] err rope but if not she's still really
[04:05:08] good
[04:05:09] and then
[04:05:11] Brian is 25 S1 E1 if not it's not really
[04:05:13] good
[04:05:14] uh asked is pretty cracked I think
[04:05:17] underrated
[04:05:18] especially with E6 and E4
[04:05:22] Yukon is decent I don't like her but I
[04:05:25] think that is purely just I don't like
[04:05:26] how she plays but I think she is pretty
[04:05:28] good and can be a sub DPS and you can
[04:05:30] run uh planetary Rendezvous and you can
[04:05:34] run this like I mean you unlock this not
[04:05:37] run so I do think there's like I do
[04:05:39] think she's bet like she's fine
[04:05:41] uh she's just more skill point uh Nami
[04:05:45] and like hungry and Ting Yoon gives you
[04:05:47] way more energy
[04:05:54] you don't like anyone I just don't like
[04:05:55] how she plays I don't dislike her I just
[04:05:58] it's like so many skill points and the
[04:05:59] buff off time lasts like negative two
[04:06:01] seconds they have to speed tune and then
[04:06:02] like yeah I'll get better with these
[04:06:03] like I might like her at E6 but then
[04:06:05] like E2 also helps like I don't know I I
[04:06:07] don't I'm not gonna say any of that in
[04:06:09] the video like she's decent you can use
[04:06:11] her it's just like Ting Yoon is better
[04:06:13] but like you can use her
[04:06:15] she's she's not like she's not bad just
[04:06:17] you need to manage her skill points and
[04:06:19] speed tune her and
[04:06:21] um idlons also help
[04:06:23] I don't think she looks good hey I think
[04:06:25] she looks good I'm not disrespecting her
[04:06:27] I'm just saying
[04:06:36] uh wealth is also decent and then I
[04:06:39] think
[04:06:40] um
[04:06:42] silver wolf and Pilar are usually like
[04:06:44] one of the two is usually your third
[04:06:45] slot and then your healers are luocha or
[04:06:48] Japan as a shield or anyone else but
[04:06:50] those are the two best ones
[04:06:56] I think that's literally everything
[04:07:03] hahaha
[04:07:12] yeah my icons are kind of [ __ ] right
[04:07:14] now uh I don't ask why this is on her
[04:07:16] usually she's on this one but now it's
[04:07:17] on pillow so I mean we could do this one
[04:07:19] for now but then Luca has no light cone
[04:07:21] I just don't have enoughility like owns
[04:07:23] because I use I like okay I use silver
[04:07:26] wolf I use Pila I use Luca I use Kafka I
[04:07:30] use
[04:07:31] um welt well I want to use wealth I
[04:07:33] literally can't so it's like I don't
[04:07:35] have enough [ __ ] utility Legos
[04:07:38] but yeah
[04:07:50] I think that hunk is good though he is
[04:07:52] definitely strong you just need to like
[04:07:54] um you need to manage your skill points
[04:07:55] so he's pretty restrictive on the teams
[04:07:57] you can so I don't think he's he he he's
[04:08:02] more his playstyle is a bit more
[04:08:04] flexible than people think
[04:08:06] because you can do like n2s if you have
[04:08:09] to like you can spare a skill point but
[04:08:11] his teams are very restrictive like
[04:08:12] there's like three teams you can play
[04:08:14] that's it like it's very restrictive and
[04:08:17] like if you do anything else or if
[04:08:18] you're not imagining your skill points
[04:08:19] he'll feel a lot worse
[04:08:29] I'm pretty sure he is similar in damage
[04:08:32] to some of the good like some of the
[04:08:35] strongest carries but he won't be as
[04:08:37] flexible
[04:08:39] um
[04:08:40] like and you have to manage your skill
[04:08:42] points
[04:08:44] yeah res I'm pretty sure I've seen calcs
[04:08:47] but I wanted to wait till he's out
[04:08:49] before diving deeper into it so I'm not
[04:08:52] gonna comment on it yet
[04:08:53] I'm not gonna comment Strickland as
[04:08:55] power level yet because
[04:08:56] I am not informed enough but I do know
[04:08:58] that he's at least very good I know
[04:09:00] these at least like strong
[04:09:03] [Music]
[04:09:13] why can't I climb his mushroom
[04:09:20] would you recommend to run with Ting
[04:09:21] Yoon and then or Harmony healer but your
[04:09:24] healer has to be skill point efficient
[04:09:25] or shielder and if you can't do that
[04:09:28] then it's fine
[04:09:29] but here's a bit worse and then your
[04:09:31] Harmony also has to be skillful and
[04:09:33] efficient and then your inhability also
[04:09:34] has to be skill point efficient so like
[04:09:36] Ting Yoon Pila and then healer
[04:09:40] I think like 90 of people are gonna run
[04:09:42] taking P11 healer but like you might
[04:09:44] have silver wolf you can use her she can
[04:09:46] be better too
[04:10:04] yes
[04:10:16] uh I'm like 99.99 sure that King Yoon
[04:10:21] Pila is
[04:10:23] better than uh tingyun yukong but you if
[04:10:26] you don't have Ting Yoon or she's on
[04:10:28] another team you can use Yukon
[04:10:32] cause like peeling Pila zero skill
[04:10:34] points to Yoon uses one and then Yukon
[04:10:36] uses one so like I mean yeah
[04:10:40] well can you use this one like first
[04:10:42] turn I'm talking about
[04:10:43] feelings is zero than zero then zero
[04:10:52] what do you just skill point gen with
[04:10:53] Yukon yeah you could
[04:10:56] probably won't be better than um
[04:10:58] I mean
[04:11:01] I guess it depends on enemy defense but
[04:11:04] like defense threat is like very
[04:11:06] valuable I guess also silver wolf is
[04:11:07] just
[04:11:10] even way more
[04:11:12] because Silver's defense threat is like
[04:11:14] [ __ ] triple
[04:11:18] but yeah defensive is really good
[04:11:21] so I don't see the like one turn buffer
[04:11:24] well I guess you also have you have more
[04:11:26] than a one turn buff because you have um
[04:11:29] like you you have the light cone and you
[04:11:31] also have uh where is it I mean you
[04:11:33] might have this but
[04:11:35] where's this one no no that was that one
[04:11:37] yeah and then you might have this too
[04:11:39] like this is also 12 percent
[04:11:41] but I honestly I don't know I feel like
[04:11:44] um I can I'm gonna look into it more but
[04:11:47] like 36 defense at level seven and then
[04:11:51] this scales up a little I think it maxes
[04:11:53] at 40. uh no it doesn't because it's
[04:11:55] plus one for level 39.
[04:11:59] that's a lot
[04:12:03] and you have the flexibility of being
[04:12:05] able to remove like cleanse an enemy
[04:12:07] basically
[04:12:25] um
[04:12:31] but what you can do with Yukon is use
[04:12:35] your skill once every like two or even
[04:12:36] three turns like you don't have to spam
[04:12:38] it
[04:12:41] um
[04:12:45] but I can't I mean yeah
[04:12:52] probably not three it would have to be
[04:12:54] every two unless you just don't alt
[04:12:56] often
[04:13:06] yukon's literally skill point neutral no
[04:13:08] yeah but Den Hong ill is -3
[04:13:11] like when you alt okay he's minus like I
[04:13:14] think 2.33 because when you Alt
[04:13:16] you gain plus two like he's not exactly
[04:13:19] negative three but when you attack it is
[04:13:21] so it's like
[04:13:22] you need your healer needs to be skilled
[04:13:24] one efficient that's one your Ting Yoon
[04:13:25] it's going to fission that's one
[04:13:27] and then you want that's only two so
[04:13:30] it's like
[04:13:31] and even uses a skill once so it's like
[04:13:33] if your other character also uses skill
[04:13:35] then you're doing a level two normal
[04:13:37] which isn't even bad like it's fine
[04:13:42] and Yukon also wants to use your skill
[04:13:43] it's not like you're never using your
[04:13:44] skill that's not true like you want to
[04:13:46] use it I mean I'm saying even if you
[04:13:48] don't like let's say you don't right
[04:13:49] let's say you just don't use your skill
[04:13:51] let me know you you need to you need
[04:13:53] roaring [ __ ]
[04:13:54] you literally need to
[04:14:13] yeah like let's say use one skill right
[04:14:15] let's say you just use one
[04:14:17] then
[04:14:18] let's say it's like similar to Ting Yoon
[04:14:25] your combo would okay your combo with
[04:14:28] Yukon instead of Ting Yoon
[04:14:31] would probably go from 333 to 322 or if
[04:14:37] you're alting every three somehow
[04:14:38] although you can't without thinking's
[04:14:39] energy you do three two two
[04:14:42] or two three three no sorry two two two
[04:14:44] three
[04:14:48] which I don't think is better
[04:14:49] um
[04:14:52] yeah
[04:14:53] also I I don't know
[04:14:59] it depends on the defense of the enemies
[04:15:01] you're fighting
[04:15:05] also like yeah you need to speak to him
[04:15:07] but that's like assumed
[04:15:09] um
[04:15:11] so I will say
[04:15:15] I also think that um
[04:15:17] the like the value of Defense start
[04:15:19] depends on enemies you're fighting but
[04:15:20] like especially in high memory chaos I
[04:15:22] feel like 36 defense is like pretty
[04:15:24] [ __ ] huge I think this is like a lot
[04:15:27] and then silver wolf like also is an
[04:15:29] option she can cost a skill point
[04:15:32] because usually you want to implant you
[04:15:34] don't have to but it also reduces res so
[04:15:36] like it's a pretty good ability
[04:15:38] um but you don't have to
[04:15:39] uh but even just like her normal attacks
[04:15:41] and give uh it will put a [ __ ] bug on
[04:15:44] them time for a bug
[04:15:46] okay that's what we're doing let's get
[04:15:48] this and then your alt also gives
[04:15:49] [ __ ] like an insane amount of Defense
[04:15:51] shred too
[04:15:53] um although it is single Target as
[04:15:55] opposed to
[04:15:56] pila's AOE
[04:16:06] when having bronze like gonna make
[04:16:07] things easier yeah yeah sure but the
[04:16:10] part of the appeal like part of the
[04:16:11] reason why I'm considering Yukon is
[04:16:12] because of planetary rendezvous
[04:16:16] which is pretty good like this isn't a
[04:16:17] this is a pretty good icon it's a lot of
[04:16:19] damage
[04:16:22] uh especially if you superimpose it
[04:16:23] right
[04:16:33] yeah like it is really good
[04:16:42] it is a lot harder to get S5 this E6
[04:16:45] Yukon than just a basting Yoon
[04:16:51] um although I guess her uh second Idol
[04:16:54] on is also quite nice
[04:16:56] uh like really really nice
[04:17:00] but yeah
[04:17:09] I mean I don't think I mean having her
[04:17:12] as like a I think she's a pretty decent
[04:17:14] all like the more I think about it
[04:17:18] the more Yukon is like a fine option
[04:17:24] but
[04:17:25] yeah
[04:17:27] still Ting Yoon
[04:17:32] um
[04:17:42] peace that's not fair every team wants
[04:17:45] to you yeah but like
[04:17:49] okay you might not have bronia but like
[04:17:50] he does not want Brian so like your
[04:17:52] other team can use bronyo
[04:17:55] um or you could use I also think ass is
[04:17:58] a pretty good option honestly you can
[04:18:00] also run planetary Rendezvous on her or
[04:18:02] no you want Mission cogs you want
[04:18:03] Mission cogs
[04:18:05] um you're all mentioning [ __ ] on her
[04:18:06] but especially if you have asset E4 or
[04:18:09] E6
[04:18:11] pretty good
[04:18:31] wanna spar
[04:18:39] it's not that bronya is like bad
[04:18:43] for him it's just you get a lot less
[04:18:45] value than with literally any other
[04:18:47] character you put bronio in because
[04:18:49] okay so like Brian is never gonna be bad
[04:18:51] because you get
[04:18:53] crit damage
[04:18:54] attack
[04:18:56] and if you use your skill you get a lot
[04:18:58] of damage so like she'll never be bad at
[04:18:59] a free turn
[04:19:03] but the reason why you probably wouldn't
[04:19:04] want to use her with that hung ill
[04:19:06] unless you have E1 and her signature
[04:19:10] like on is because
[04:19:12] his teams already are like very [ __ ]
[04:19:15] it's so hard to use three skill points
[04:19:18] on them every turn it's really hard like
[04:19:20] you can't do you can't heal you can't
[04:19:22] [ __ ] like peel a skill you can't do
[04:19:24] anything you just skill three times you
[04:19:25] get it that's it so if you want bronny
[04:19:29] to work with him you can't if you use
[04:19:31] bronny's skill you're gonna do uh
[04:19:34] you're not gonna have enough skill
[04:19:35] points because brawny's skill is
[04:19:37] effectively minus two skill points when
[04:19:39] you compare her to like Pila because
[04:19:41] Pila normal attack that's plus one skill
[04:19:43] point bronya's skill that's minus one so
[04:19:46] the difference between minus one and
[04:19:46] plus one is two so it's literally
[04:19:48] basically two skill points less so
[04:19:52] there's probably a case to be made of
[04:19:53] like okay well Brian gives you so much
[04:19:55] damage
[04:19:56] that like
[04:19:58] it's fine or like you could make your
[04:20:00] dad Hong still do like a normal like
[04:20:03] let's say two charge and then or like
[04:20:05] just a normal normal and then you go
[04:20:06] again and then you do a three charge and
[04:20:08] you're buffed like there's definitely
[04:20:10] ways to play around it it's just that
[04:20:11] like she's a lot worse with him than
[04:20:13] with another character
[04:20:15] like with blade for example you attack
[04:20:16] and you broaden it then you attack again
[04:20:18] and you don't need to think about it but
[04:20:20] with danong ill it's like
[04:20:23] yeah exactly you could like but dude do
[04:20:26] you know how
[04:20:27] okay I don't think this is bad but you
[04:20:30] know how bad it feels to do a a no
[04:20:33] charge like basic normal attack on Den
[04:20:35] hung then go branya then skill and then
[04:20:38] use him again like it works but it's
[04:20:40] like it's just it's like Ugh like I
[04:20:42] would rather play her with any other
[04:20:44] character
[04:20:46] um
[04:20:48] yeah
[04:20:52] so it's like is it better than nothing
[04:20:54] yeah like you can probably make it work
[04:20:56] but it's not
[04:20:58] yeah
[04:20:59] you also get that like you do get a lot
[04:21:01] of damage it's just like you lose out on
[04:21:03] a lot of it or you wanna or you're gonna
[04:21:05] like [ __ ] base attack on her and then
[04:21:07] it's like well
[04:21:45] okay you wanna see my my brownie goblet
[04:21:47] my brownie a ball my brontos here 29. on
[04:21:51] a credit understand
[04:22:01] who asked I asked me I asked
[04:22:04] I asked
[04:22:13] yeah I think overall with him though
[04:22:15] it's like you want to do so you want to
[04:22:17] do a level three normal attack if you
[04:22:19] can whenever you can like okay there's
[04:22:21] like tight rotations was like you could
[04:22:22] do 333 or you could do three two two two
[04:22:25] two but like I feel like the more I get
[04:22:27] into that the more it's like it depends
[04:22:28] on 17 million things and that tilts me
[04:22:30] because it's like then I'll give advice
[04:22:32] to someone and then it just won't help
[04:22:33] them so generally I think you go for
[04:22:35] three and then sometimes you have to do
[04:22:36] two
[04:22:37] some teams have to do too they have to
[04:22:40] do two two and then three or two two and
[04:22:42] then three
[04:22:43] um although you probably no it would be
[04:22:45] for three two it's not uh three two but
[04:22:47] anyways but in general it's like try to
[04:22:50] do three and if you can't then we think
[04:22:51] in a two is fine and sometimes leaving
[04:22:54] in a zero if you need to like finish off
[04:22:56] an enemy or save skill points for like a
[04:22:59] boss or whatever the [ __ ] that's fine
[04:23:00] too whereas generally you go for three
[04:23:02] if not two
[04:23:04] and you never do one one is ass
[04:23:09] yes
[04:23:11] can I see your bronica damage no I don't
[04:23:13] even know if we are [ __ ] I don't
[04:23:15] think our body is even plus 15 like
[04:23:17] we're not like we didn't Min maxer it's
[04:23:19] just our ball is really good
[04:23:21] like my good Christmas pieces are on
[04:23:23] other characters like for example okay
[04:23:25] there's not even
[04:23:27] okay like my good crit damage pieces are
[04:23:30] like on him right it's like I don't want
[04:23:32] to give them the brawn it's good on
[04:23:33] running but it's like I'd rather make my
[04:23:35] carry like I don't know man I'll build
[04:23:37] her soon I'll build her soon soon not
[04:23:40] copy him soon soon soon soon
[04:23:52] also
[04:23:55] to talk about this set
[04:23:58] musketeer is like pretty like Unga Bunga
[04:24:00] consistent right because like
[04:24:03] wait why am I on three what why did it
[04:24:05] say three oh because I was yeah
[04:24:07] this is blah the four piece is pretty
[04:24:10] consistent it's like you don't need to
[04:24:11] think about it you could just go it
[04:24:13] um and then this one has a lot of
[04:24:14] conditionals on the four piece however
[04:24:16] if you're playing pillow or even silver
[04:24:19] wolf
[04:24:20] there's basically no situation where you
[04:24:22] don't have 10 imaginary damage
[04:24:24] and 20 crit value or like 10 crit rate
[04:24:27] so like that's still a lot right
[04:24:32] um even if you're not getting the 20
[04:24:34] crit damage at the end the 200 to the
[04:24:36] end you'll get against imaginary weak
[04:24:38] enemies because that hung has really
[04:24:40] good break so you're gonna imprison them
[04:24:43] probably
[04:24:45] and then you'll get some damage
[04:24:49] um
[04:24:52] so I don't think this four piece is like
[04:24:55] as situational because even if you don't
[04:24:57] get the damage it's pretty good but
[04:24:58] obviously you don't want to get thicker
[04:24:59] damage
[04:25:01] um and also the crit rate doesn't work
[04:25:02] for like rudolent Arena so you still
[04:25:05] will need 70 crit rate outside of that
[04:25:06] 10.
[04:25:10] um and then musketeer is just like the
[04:25:12] general set
[04:25:13] like it's just good attack basic attack
[04:25:15] damage which is really good and then
[04:25:17] speed so it's like
[04:25:19] which was good
[04:25:24] um
[04:25:25] yeah
[04:25:29] silver for the wheelchair priority pull
[04:25:30] from okay Lu Workshop is probably 18
[04:25:33] times as valuable for him
[04:25:35] unless you have japard I guess like if
[04:25:37] you have Japan and like no Pila
[04:25:39] available
[04:25:41] then yeah but like Lewis was like so
[04:25:45] [ __ ] good with him
[04:25:46] because you use Lucha uses so okay does
[04:25:49] without skill points are
[04:25:52] basic attacks so generate skill points
[04:25:53] obviously and then heal cleanse and then
[04:25:57] set a field that heals you when you
[04:25:58] attack without any skill points it's
[04:26:00] like okay literally better than a bailu
[04:26:03] without even using your skill okay he's
[04:26:05] if you can't use his skill ever
[04:26:08] [ __ ] it if you can't use a skill or his
[04:26:10] alt he's still better than like Natasha
[04:26:12] maybe you want to alt but like you're
[04:26:13] gonna alt anyway like literally better
[04:26:16] than the other healers without even
[04:26:18] using his skill
[04:26:19] so it's like really good for him
[04:26:22] um yeah
[04:26:33] still world is also insane though but
[04:26:35] for Dan Hong in particular
[04:26:37] like
[04:26:38] yeah she's like an upgrade over Pila but
[04:26:41] not by that much pillow's uptime is 100
[04:26:42] Pila uses zero skill points silver wolf
[04:26:45] might want to use one to implant that
[04:26:47] doesn't mean she's worse it's just she's
[04:26:49] not always like a strict like way better
[04:26:51] it's just a bit better usually more
[04:26:53] single Target too and less like Fearless
[04:26:56] free to play so
[04:27:01] please stop calling her Pila you can't
[04:27:03] tell me what to do
[04:27:06] but like the thing about the world is
[04:27:07] like I don't want people to think also
[04:27:09] that you need to implant for her to be
[04:27:10] good because I feel like people are
[04:27:12] gonna fall into the Trap of always
[04:27:13] playing like oh I need to play mono
[04:27:14] imaginary it's like no the [ __ ] you
[04:27:15] don't like yeah it's probably still a
[04:27:17] good team but like you don't [ __ ]
[04:27:19] need to like her defense tread is still
[04:27:20] really high it's like even if you never
[04:27:22] touch your skill and you probably should
[04:27:24] because it does reduce resistances but
[04:27:25] even if you never press your skill you
[04:27:27] are putting bugs on enemies that like
[04:27:29] reduce let's say defense by six and then
[04:27:31] you're also reducing defense here so
[04:27:32] it's like even if you're not using skill
[04:27:34] she's really good and then you also can
[04:27:36] use your skill but then it's like she'll
[04:27:37] be less skill point efficient
[04:27:39] but yeah so they're both good I think
[04:27:42] they're both really good
[04:27:52] I lost okay I can't lie this is gonna
[04:27:55] mean I'm a terrible guide maker but I
[04:27:57] have no I don't [ __ ] remember what
[04:27:58] our Lawns do I am not lying energy POG
[04:28:01] that's actually really good energy is
[04:28:02] really good uh
[04:28:04] uh that doesn't matter
[04:28:06] that also doesn't matter okay it's just
[04:28:07] E1
[04:28:08] wait what is he too
[04:28:10] I mean
[04:28:11] not a situational no it's mostly just
[04:28:13] the one
[04:28:15] um and then whichever one of these gives
[04:28:16] her more I'm pretty sure alt is that
[04:28:18] yeah alt is the defense thread so
[04:28:19] leveling the alt is also nice but E1 is
[04:28:22] the is a good one yeah
[04:28:26] also technique but I mean you can't
[04:28:28] level your [ __ ] technique
[04:28:33] E4 good for ice teams I'm I'm talking
[04:28:35] about I'm talking about that I'm talking
[04:28:36] about that hung we're talking about that
[04:28:37] hug we're only talking about him we're
[04:28:38] only talking about him don't take this
[04:28:39] out of context oh Zion said effort shut
[04:28:41] the [ __ ] up we're talking about that
[04:28:42] Hong hill we are only talking about this
[04:28:44] guy that is all I'm talking about okay
[04:28:46] trust me I built her as an ice carry
[04:28:49] last [ __ ] I know we died in memory of
[04:28:51] chaos 12 or 7 not 12. what's the last
[04:28:53] four in this [ __ ] game like nine
[04:28:54] whatever in the last one but we don't
[04:28:56] talk about it okay we we just we built
[04:28:58] her for alt we're probably ill right now
[04:29:01] but yeah this is pretty good for her
[04:29:02] damage and other ice characters
[04:29:05] 10. whatever
[04:29:08] Abyss 12.
[04:29:19] so you're telling me her E4 is for Jing
[04:29:21] Liu susk how do you know about that
[04:29:24] character
[04:29:25] not the character I mean I guess we've
[04:29:27] seen their art on Twitter so yeah maybe
[04:29:31] sauce
[04:29:35] we did see their drip on x.com my
[04:29:38] favorite website I heck and love X
[04:29:46] we've seen them in game I know man but
[04:29:47] in game you would be like wow this looks
[04:29:49] like a ice carry
[04:30:01] wait what is the sound
[04:30:03] you played as her oh
[04:30:05] okay I have a lower Skipper I'm sorry I
[04:30:08] don't okay I'm not a skipper I just
[04:30:10] haven't done it I haven't done it I
[04:30:12] literally you remember I haven't done it
[04:30:14] I haven't done it I haven't done it fine
[04:30:16] you [ __ ] win okay you win Chad are
[04:30:18] you happy you win you win you win I'm
[04:30:20] sorry
[04:30:25] I don't think I did it it's not like I
[04:30:26] like for Gore I just don't think I did
[04:30:28] it
[04:30:30] uh I guess you could press J
[04:30:33] this isn't even that many I don't even
[04:30:35] have a lot of quests left like I had
[04:30:36] everything done before on 1.0 I finished
[04:30:38] literally a request but since then I
[04:30:40] have to catch up
[04:30:41] I'll do it I'll do it
[04:30:51] man but I should but I don't want to
[04:30:53] because now I'm gonna have to [ __ ]
[04:30:54] edit and record and I don't want to do
[04:30:56] that it's not that I don't like doing it
[04:30:57] it's I'd rather stream but it's okay I'm
[04:30:59] gonna do it
[04:31:02] I think the only thing in the team
[04:31:03] section I want to re-record is Yukon
[04:31:04] because my understanding of her old
[04:31:07] friends is still developing I should
[04:31:09] probably level mine so I can play her I
[04:31:11] might do that off stream thanks for
[04:31:12] watching I love you guys
[04:31:14] I will see you all in probably two days
[04:31:17] so tomorrow I can upload and stuff
[04:31:20] expect a dad hung ill guide soon I'd say
[04:31:23] tomorrow is the plan
[04:31:26] I will stream again probably gentian and
[04:31:28] then start rail maybe we'll see maybe
[04:31:30] another star rail if I'm feeling it well
[04:31:31] I want to do both my goal my plan my my
[04:31:34] sorry my plan is to do both so we'll see
[04:31:37] thanks for watching
[04:31:39] I hope you enjoyed your stay
[04:31:42] balls also so you guys know for this
[04:31:45] entire streams I did not have seven TV
[04:31:49] it doesn't work I don't know why I even
[04:31:51] refreshed it it still doesn't [ __ ]
[04:31:53] work so I literally if you type balls I
[04:31:55] don't even see the emote so I've just
[04:31:57] been seeing people typing words the
[04:31:58] whole time
[04:32:00] and it's been driving me insane
[04:32:02] little by little second by second stand
[04:32:05] in the middle
[04:32:07] like you a little it's okay it's no big
[04:32:09] deal
[04:32:12] with that in mind I'm now going to end
[04:32:14] the live broadcast
[04:32:24] and with that said
[04:32:26] uh expect the den hung guide within a
[04:32:28] day or two but probably tomorrow it
[04:32:29] should be tomorrow it's it's done being
[04:32:31] recorded well I just have to record a
[04:32:32] little bit more and then I'm gonna edit
[04:32:33] it
[04:32:34] uh but I love you guys and I will try to
[04:32:36] be as thorough as possible but I it's
[04:32:38] like the video I don't want it to be
[04:32:39] pushing like 59 minutes so I'll try to
[04:32:41] like
[04:32:42] I don't know we'll see what I do but uh
[04:32:44] he's pretty straight he's like his kid
[04:32:46] is complicated but his build and his
[04:32:48] teams and everything else is very
[04:32:50] straightforward like he's super simple
[04:32:52] to build but he's very hard to like
[04:32:58] rotate like like play I guess like not
[04:33:00] really like you can probably just Auto
[04:33:01] Battle but like you need to have a good
[04:33:03] team and like the the Nuance between how
[04:33:07] often you can alt how often your team
[04:33:08] Yoon can alt how often like what you
[04:33:11] need to build on your supports for them
[04:33:12] to alt which I'll cover
[04:33:14] affecting you in particular at least an
[04:33:16] Asta and like sh like the weird like
[04:33:18] nuanced stuff not weird but like the
[04:33:20] super specifics that was kind of hard so
[04:33:22] it's like hard to like
[04:33:23] cover all that but I will do my best
[04:33:26] and speed tuning yeah but
[04:33:28] that's mostly for the other character
[04:33:29] well it is also for like for that all
[04:33:32] you need to know about speed tuning is
[04:33:33] like you kind of want to get one three
[04:33:34] four for the two cycles in the first
[04:33:36] second two turns in the first cycle but
[04:33:38] for the rest it's just like either your
[04:33:41] whole team is fast or your whole team is
[04:33:42] slow you just and you want your supports
[04:33:44] to go right before him
[04:33:51] friends
[04:33:53] yet again
[04:34:02] but it's also like I don't know when to
[04:34:03] mention that I think I'm pretty sure I
[04:34:04] mentioned when I talk about speed like
[04:34:06] the boot part but then I don't want
[04:34:07] someone to skip to the team section and
[04:34:08] then not hear me say that so it's like
[04:34:10] do I need to repeat it in the team
[04:34:12] section but then it's like I'm adding an
[04:34:13] extra minute to the video I actually
[04:34:15] don't know [ __ ] like that like in Star
[04:34:16] rail a lot of the like info you should
[04:34:19] know I never know where the [ __ ] to put
[04:34:20] it like I'll put it somewhere but it's
[04:34:22] like
[04:34:23] yeah
[04:34:25] I don't know
[04:34:26] I'll probably put it in like
[04:34:28] I mean I already I already put it in the
[04:34:30] speed section but I might put it in the
[04:34:32] team section as well just be like make
[04:34:34] sure they're faster anyways there's a
[04:34:35] watch I'm gonna add we're gonna arrange
