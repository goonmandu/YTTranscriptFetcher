[00:13:16] I don't care I don't make money on
[00:13:17] Twitter I don't give a [ __ ] but I'm just
[00:13:18] saying 40K likes 400k views this one a
[00:13:22] million oh it's said a million earlier
[00:13:23] yeah a million [ __ ] views what are
[00:13:26] people doing to it it was a joke
[00:13:36] anyways it l lit do you know why I'm
[00:13:38] going to be full like full B like this
[00:13:42] is like I'm leaking content creator
[00:13:44] Secrets right now I don't give a [ __ ] I
[00:13:45] was uploading my 4.4 reaction video and
[00:13:47] I was like I wonder what other people
[00:13:49] think and I just youtubed 4.4 reaction
[00:13:51] and then these were the first two
[00:13:52] results I was like oh and I just took a
[00:13:54] picture that's it that's literally the
[00:13:56] whole thought process that was the
[00:13:58] entire thing
[00:13:59] that was the whole thought
[00:14:01] process
[00:14:03] any something that wasn't I mean
[00:14:05] honestly Doro you want my actual take I
[00:14:07] was thinking about this I think this if
[00:14:09] anything just
[00:14:11] like like let's say I'm you right this
[00:14:13] just strengthened in my opinion I think
[00:14:15] this strengthens your community cuz
[00:14:17] whenever there's something like this
[00:14:18] people will like rally behind the person
[00:14:20] they like and they'll be like oh what's
[00:14:22] wrong with positivity and then they'll
[00:14:23] just rally behind so if anything it
[00:14:24] helps my opinion but I don't know
[00:14:26] anyways um
[00:14:29] yeah Twitter's definitely a place just
[00:14:31] chasing drama we know what the [ __ ] is
[00:14:32] The Kinks what do you mean what what do
[00:14:34] you mean
[00:14:37] Kinks I mean the okay the the thing is
[00:14:40] I'm I'm going keep it a a dollar what is
[00:14:42] the drama there's none there's none
[00:14:44] there's no drama I'm not a drama farmer
[00:14:47] but I just posted a picture as a joke
[00:14:49] and then some people got not mad no no
[00:14:52] one got mad but it was like you
[00:14:56] know the content creator flight me they
[00:14:59] people flaming Conor creators which
[00:15:01] isn't very ideal but
[00:15:03] anyways be
[00:15:05] nice uh I will I will say though I I
[00:15:09] will say though we'll talk about the the
[00:15:11] the Zio bench tier list later um I have
[00:15:13] this open but anyways I will say
[00:15:20] though I will say though
[00:15:23] um oh g hi
[00:15:27] G
[00:15:31] please I will
[00:15:32] sayd be funny and he said he genuinely
[00:15:35] likes on stream off thanks for the 100
[00:15:39] bits
[00:15:42] um what was I going to say yeah I I
[00:15:45] don't know how it got a million which is
[00:15:46] weird cuz that means that either people
[00:15:48] are quot tweeting it or people are just
[00:15:49] sharing it I don't
[00:15:53] know but let's move
[00:15:56] on um
[00:16:02] I'm not getting involved I don't care
[00:16:03] I'm not I'm not I'm not saying any
[00:16:05] opinions um but I do think it's a lot
[00:16:08] easier to live your
[00:16:11] life
[00:16:14] um I think it's a lot easier to live
[00:16:16] your
[00:16:19] life okay here's my take I think it's a
[00:16:21] lot easier to live your life being
[00:16:23] excited about things however I think
[00:16:25] it's a lot easier as a content creator
[00:16:27] to be mad about things so like me
[00:16:29] personally I always always always bring
[00:16:33] up how [ __ ] garbage it is that we
[00:16:35] don't have endgame or real C I could do
[00:16:36] with my friends I say every survey we
[00:16:38] [ __ ] get every time I can I bring it
[00:16:41] up however as a as a player of genin
[00:16:46] anytime I get something that I am
[00:16:47] excited about I like to show the
[00:16:49] excitement so I'm not just going to be
[00:16:50] like like let's say oh when you plunge
[00:16:53] [ __ ] support oh my God like that
[00:16:55] makes me happy I'm not going to be like
[00:16:57] oh no raids though
[00:17:00] so it's like oh [ __ ] I [ __ ] lowered
[00:17:02] my camera so like you know there there's
[00:17:04] Nuance to things there there's Nuance to
[00:17:06] things uh I'm I'm very much in the
[00:17:09] middle as much as I like to be hype you
[00:17:12] know uh uh uh I like to to keep it a
[00:17:16] buck uh I think some people benefit out
[00:17:19] of making things either better than they
[00:17:22] seem or worse than they seem for example
[00:17:24] I could milk things by making them seem
[00:17:26] a lot more exciting than they are or
[00:17:28] milk things by being like like Shifting
[00:17:30] The Narrative like Shifting the argument
[00:17:31] being like Oh we got a free skin but oh
[00:17:34] well star rail got [ __ ] do [ __ ] so
[00:17:37] where's my Dr [ __ ] like you know there's
[00:17:39] a lot of you can make whatever you want
[00:17:41] out of stuff I don't like to get into
[00:17:43] that I don't give a [ __ ] quite frankly
[00:17:45] it's not worth it for me that's not the
[00:17:47] community I want I don't want to be
[00:17:48] [ __ ] 50 years old and look back at my
[00:17:50] community of 12-year-olds that are like
[00:17:53] oh yeah [ __ ] you anyways it's fine it is
[00:17:55] what it is so this is I'm just saying
[00:17:57] nothing right now but uh uh so genin
[00:18:00] hello
[00:18:03] Jud why did your okay the [ __ ] Dono

[00:18:12] wait I open never
[00:18:15] mind is you I wasn't molding I'm just
[00:18:19] saying also speaking of which I see
[00:18:22] [ __ ] sometimes being like Oh
[00:18:24] like these content creators are so
[00:18:26] afraid to say something against hoyo
[00:18:28] it's like okay I don't know who you're
[00:18:31] watching cuz I this is never about me
[00:18:33] for the most part I don't know who
[00:18:34] you're watching I can say whatever the
[00:18:36] [ __ ] I want i' and full disclosure I've
[00:18:39] worked with them I've done sponsors with
[00:18:40] them I I do sponsor them sometimes I I I
[00:18:43] there's a lot of [ __ ] I do with them but
[00:18:45] I told them hey for full disclosure I'm
[00:18:47] allowed to talk about stuff and like
[00:18:49] still be like critical and mean and [ __ ]
[00:18:51] and they're like yes just don't be like
[00:18:54] death threats or like slandering for no
[00:18:56] reason like you know [ __ ] like that but
[00:18:57] outside of all that I say whatever the
[00:18:59] [ __ ] I want to say so I don't know why
[00:19:00] people are like oh oh this person's
[00:19:02] hating on the game but at least they're
[00:19:03] not bought it's like I hate on the game
[00:19:04] every [ __ ] day suck my balls sorry
[00:19:07] it's fine anyways uh uh more resin
[00:19:09] please uh uh de fix please raids please
[00:19:12] Co-op please make Ryden and bet work
[00:19:14] together please uh uh uh yoia I don't
[00:19:16] care people don't care about yia's burst
[00:19:17] anymore I do what the [ __ ] is yia's
[00:19:19] burst sorry let's move on what did D
[00:19:23] say I'll go a positive guy feel think
[00:19:26] I'm a dick rider don't give a [ __ ] well
[00:19:28] I I'm not going to be like the Arbiter
[00:19:31] of Justice here acting like I know
[00:19:33] everything do whatever the [ __ ] you want
[00:19:34] but personally I don't think it's I
[00:19:36] don't think okay I think there's a
[00:19:38] difference between being excited about
[00:19:40] something I don't think that's dick
[00:19:41] writing versus being like yeah genin's
[00:19:43] perfect we don't need like okay for
[00:19:45] examp here's a good example of what I
[00:19:46] think the the line between dick riding
[00:19:47] and not dick riding is when I say
[00:19:49] something like hey I wish we had more
[00:19:52] endgame I wish I could raid with my
[00:19:53] friends and then [ __ ] are like
[00:19:55] oh go play another game get to the story
[00:19:56] game you probably want a skip button no
[00:19:58] go play [ __ ] final combat six [ __ ]
[00:20:01] you that's dick riding shut up dude what
[00:20:05] they can they can make a end game if I
[00:20:07] want anyways Z Jeff dick rid sing Cho
[00:20:11] okay but Singo is like he Singo is top
[00:20:13] two units in the game and he's not two
[00:20:16] I'm kidding I'm kind of biased I still
[00:20:17] don't know where I stand I I I thought
[00:20:19] Bennett my whole life but I'm I actually
[00:20:22] don't know who I put number one anymore
[00:20:23] cuz my whole life I saw Bennett but now
[00:20:25] there's a lot of teams that can use that
[00:20:26] need Hydro but don't need Bennett but
[00:20:28] then in those teams you could also use
[00:20:29] like yolan or finina or nlet instead of
[00:20:31] SRO so it's hard to determine I feel
[00:20:33] like number one is like Hydro support
[00:20:35] like nameless Hydro support it's like
[00:20:37] one of them because it depends and then
[00:20:39] number two is benett anyways and then
[00:20:41] Kaz
[00:20:43] Nita but yeah so smiley
[00:20:51] face number one is hydro the
[00:20:54] element cuz here's the thing if yeah
[00:20:59] it's like I would say in a vacuum it's
[00:21:02] like prob Like You could argue SRO
[00:21:06] utility Hydro op Dam like all that [ __ ]
[00:21:09] but then it's like well what if you have
[00:21:11] it's like he's also kind of like there's
[00:21:14] getting more Hydro options you can use
[00:21:17] so it's like it's still the correct
[00:21:19] answer but it could be like it's like
[00:21:20] Cal Aster CU it could be like yolan it
[00:21:22] could be finina it could be nevet it
[00:21:23] could be child well not really child but
[00:21:25] Shang thing anyways doesn't matter I'm
[00:21:28] getting distracted uh I I don't really
[00:21:30] have anything important to say but I uh
[00:21:32] I feel like when I act like I have
[00:21:33] something to say uh people are
[00:21:35] interested so I'm acting like I have
[00:21:36] something to say when I actually don't
[00:21:38] so I'm just wasting all of your time
[00:21:39] someone made a tier list of my benched
[00:21:42] characters uh which I talked about this
[00:21:45] last stream but I didn't tweet about it
[00:21:47] now I tweeted about it this is [ __ ]
[00:21:48] this is not true this is not real none
[00:21:50] of this is accurate however they also
[00:21:53] well they also did a star real one also
[00:21:54] not accurate dude I didn't bench
[00:22:00] none of these are accurate uh apparently
[00:22:02] when I reacted to
[00:22:04] it they made a new one a Zio approved
[00:22:09] the bench tier
[00:22:12] list and they wrote down everything I
[00:22:15] said benched fun but benched thinking of
[00:22:19] using more but benched the L guide
[00:22:22] benched because skill issue kind of
[00:22:24] benched number one IO power C by net use
[00:22:28] sometimes that was a lie will eventually

[00:34:39] like actually I use them for every like
[00:34:41] Abyss 9 10 11 so I think occasional I

[00:35:04] cuz honestly I feel like I've done child
[00:35:06] dirty recently I haven't played him
[00:35:07] enough I was going to make a a new child
[00:35:10] video like guide and I just didn't so I
[00:35:11] didn't really play him but we will go
[00:35:13] back to
[00:35:14] him
[00:35:16] diona I feel like I've used her recently
[00:35:18] but I don't remember why I think I did
[00:35:21] some fourar clear we'll put her in rare
[00:35:22] usage not fully benched I'm being honest
[00:35:24] Jong Le one of the most used I tried to
[00:35:27] stop myself from using him because once
[00:35:29] a [ __ ] you raisin just kidding thanks
[00:35:32] for the pre you just subbed before
[00:35:34] following are you look Prime full are
[00:35:37] you okay thanks for the prime though I
[00:35:39] appreciate it anyways uh jeang Lee I'm
[00:35:43] going to be honest there was a time
[00:35:44] where I used them every [ __ ] Team all
[00:35:46] the time and then I got so bad at
[00:35:47] dodging that I have to remove him from
[00:35:48] my team to like this was like two years
[00:35:50] ago to remember how to dodge against
[00:35:52] theu keni and ever since I use him I
[00:35:54] like him but I don't like abuse him so
[00:35:56] he's going to be still used actually I
[00:35:58] think he's still up here cuz a lot of
[00:35:59] like meta teams that I like like even
[00:36:00] some sh teams preina some Linny teams H
[00:36:04] still
[00:36:06] used
[00:36:10] shinan
[00:36:13] albo I think he has okay here's my albo
[00:36:16] take in an ideal world where we get new
[00:36:19] Geo characters every once in a while
[00:36:21] albo would have moderate usage but as it
[00:36:23] stands I don't use him unless we get a
[00:36:25] new Geo character but recently we got
[00:36:28] Navia and I played him a bit with Navia
[00:36:29] so I think he's somewhere in here
[00:36:30] probably in like the rare usage doing
[00:36:33] bro uh maybe what if we get another he
[00:36:35] might go up to
[00:36:40] occasional we'll put him in occasion
[00:36:46] H when was the last time you used them
[00:36:48] well recently because of
[00:36:49] Navia but outside of that it's probably
[00:36:54] rare Okay g
[00:36:57] okay okay okay okay G is going to go uh
[00:36:59] listen listen listen listen listen
[00:37:02] before he talk about G you listen before
[00:37:03] he talk about G you I have been okay
[00:37:06] sometimes I'm so addicted to genin that
[00:37:09] sometimes I
[00:37:12] just sometimes I literally just stop and
[00:37:14] have a random genin idea I'm just hit
[00:37:16] like Bo boom and then I I think and I'm
[00:37:18] like wait a second why am I using G as a
[00:37:20] burst support I actually like her I just
[00:37:23] [ __ ] hate charge attacking like
[00:37:25] charge shotting so I I've been telling
[00:37:27] myself yo Z you should play G burst
[00:37:30] support this was recent so we might
[00:37:33] bring
[00:37:34] that okay she's bench okay she's okay
[00:37:37] fine fine fine RAR us listen I'm giving
[00:37:39] myself the benefit of the doubt listen I
[00:37:42] think we're going to be using her okay
[00:37:44] but as a burst
[00:37:46] support
[00:37:48] sh uh let me make a new shout tier let
[00:37:51] me make a new shout here let me make a
[00:37:53] new shout here let me make it Animo why
[00:37:55] does that change that [ __ ] color and
[00:37:56] not the other
[00:37:57] color animal
[00:37:59] color is the you that's
[00:38:02] ugly that's not really I mean it is kind
[00:38:04] of anal Shia lament okay Shia a tier for
[00:38:10] every character
[00:38:11] bro okay real realistically he's there
[00:38:14] but like
[00:38:16] dude Hut not benched um probably in the
[00:38:19] still used because there's so many the
[00:38:21] thing with DPS characters is even if I
[00:38:23] really like them I can't use more than
[00:38:26] like two per ays run so it's like I
[00:38:29] can't if I love Hut I love net I love
[00:38:32] Shia I love alham I love Soo I love
[00:38:35] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:38:37] B I can't use well B's kind of a support
[00:38:39] but you get my point I can't use them
[00:38:41] all in the same
[00:38:42] team Rosaria next to Kaaya not
[00:38:47] benched okay what's the difference
[00:38:48] between not benched and moderate
[00:38:52] usage what the [ __ ] is this
[00:38:55] tier
[00:39:05] um maybe I'll just delete this
[00:39:09] one okay Yen Fe I'm going to put her in
[00:39:12] the rare usage tier because um the more
[00:39:16] tiar you add the more you are lying to
[00:39:17] yourself
[00:39:20] omiga okay I'm about to unvented today
[00:39:23] though I'm literally going to play okay
[00:39:24] I if if my yen is built she goes in the
[00:39:28] not bench category agree let's
[00:39:36] see okay I mean listen it something went
[00:39:41] wrong along the way also I just realized
[00:39:43] this is an attack oblet uh I don't want
[00:39:45] to talk right now but we will be playing
[00:39:47] Yen today because I need some Yen
[00:39:49] footage so uh I'm going to put her in
[00:39:51] rare usage
[00:39:54] okay rare usage
[00:39:58] if you play Yen say one of her voice
[00:40:00] lines I'm Yen okay yeah all right my bad
[00:40:04] uh uh okay YULA
[00:40:09] uh I love
[00:40:16] YULA Kaza most used one of our most
[00:40:22] used uh aaka I actually do like aaka I
[00:40:25] play her every time I to try freeze
[00:40:26] teams in the abyss I feel like recently
[00:40:29] freeze teams have been well I think this
[00:40:30] Abyss works
[00:40:32] but a lot of the abysses recently it's
[00:40:34] kind of been ass not ass but like
[00:40:36] annoying to play so I've been playing
[00:40:37] her less but I think occasional usage is
[00:40:41] fair what's up plays the character once
[00:40:44] thinks they're bench now on thinks
[00:40:46] they're unbench now on dude I can't have
[00:40:48] Perma [ __ ] 50 characters Off the
[00:40:50] Bench there's like 70 Genet characters
[00:40:52] now Yia oh oh oh oh oh okay okay okay so
[00:40:56] so Yia objectively benched but recently
[00:40:59] sh has got us playing Yia so I would put
[00:41:03] her in the rare usage tier okay I think
[00:41:06] this tier is just copium bench
[00:41:19] tier TB is
[00:41:24] one saw you yeah I thought he was
[00:41:26] benched Ryden I like Ryden she's still
[00:41:30] used still
[00:41:32] used actually okay I'm going to be
[00:41:35] honest I've been using her recently
[00:41:37] but I started using Ryden less because I
[00:41:41] have her C2 and I don't
[00:41:44] like I don't like having reden C2
[00:41:47] because it makes my damage unrelatable
[00:41:49] so I use her less so put it on
[00:41:50] occasional usage I wish I had C zero why
[00:41:53] did youa cute ooo at Zio explain low Ula
[00:41:57] ranking no no ula's actually really high
[00:41:58] it's just she's next to duuk whom I love
[00:42:00] that's why that's all uh
[00:42:02] Sara yeah I mean rare
[00:42:07] usage I'm going to add another row this
[00:42:09] row is going to be
[00:42:11] called I don't want to admit that they
[00:42:15] are benched but I because sometimes I'll
[00:42:20] be like Wow Let's play this character
[00:42:23] haha woo and let's put uh Yia and Sara
[00:42:28] here okay Ki my
[00:42:38] queen c nation please rise up for your
[00:42:40] leader we're going to name this tier
[00:42:45] fish okay this is a lot of tiers I maybe
[00:42:49] we'll just pomi and lament
[00:42:52] actually we'll put her
[00:42:55] here
[00:42:57] bro go next to okay aloy hey Hey listen
[00:43:02] I've realized that the longer genin goes
[00:43:04] on the less people have aloy the more if
[00:43:07] I Crown mine and make her look good I
[00:43:09] could actually convince new players that
[00:43:11] she was actually broken and this was the
[00:43:14] doctor ratio of genin so so I'm going to
[00:43:18] Crown her and it will listen we're going
[00:43:21] to unv her
[00:43:25] soon I'm just saying so I'm going to put
[00:43:28] her for now in
[00:43:31] um I don't want to admit that they're
[00:43:33] Ben because sometimes I'm going to use
[00:43:34] them Toma rare usage some I do some I do
[00:43:38] do some Burge and stuff uh I'd say
[00:43:41] occasional honestly cuz I play him with
[00:43:42] like Shia Scara sometimes with C6
[00:43:44] unironically look look look I promise
[00:43:46] you he's going to be on relics he's
[00:43:48] going to be on actual artifacts he's
[00:43:50] going to be on artifacts look I promise
[00:43:51] you I could show you the world where is
[00:43:55] he where is he where is he where is he
[00:43:56] where is he where is he where the [ __ ]
[00:43:57] is

[00:44:16] very nice he seemed very funny very
[00:44:18] chill uh I like EO I like
[00:44:25] EO
[00:44:27] oh did I [ __ ] up his name I don't know
[00:44:28] I'm bad with names anyways cool guy um I
[00:44:31] thinko goes in
[00:44:37] um rare usage I mean he's he's a little
[00:44:40] benched but like I it's not really
[00:44:44] like but
[00:44:47] like Goro yeah Goro's Ben Shena I like
[00:44:51] Shena I like Shena and listen if listen
[00:44:54] listen no no no no no
[00:44:56] if you have anything to say about
[00:45:02] Shena please say it to my
[00:45:05] face say it to her
[00:45:10] face I do like her I played her with uh
[00:45:12] rizzly recently show weapon look okay
[00:45:15] it's the it's the level 21 cuz I swapped
[00:45:16] it with ya Yao but usually she's on fav
[00:45:18] it's actually not bad and I run her on
[00:45:20] um either echo or twopiece
[00:45:22] twopiece see 3.2k attack with a bunch of
[00:45:25] ER and kind of enough crit for fav so
[00:45:28] unironically a good build true um I'd
[00:45:32] put her in like probably in this tier
[00:45:34] though she's a bit lower than the others
[00:45:36] but yeah
[00:45:40] yunen
[00:45:43] okay um I like
[00:45:47] yunen I like
[00:45:51] yunen not
[00:45:54] bed we're going to put her in the um
[00:45:58] rare usage
[00:46:01] tier Fang's not here to be honest Fang
[00:46:03] will see this if I put her any lower
[00:46:05] we'll put her in the next to next to
[00:46:07] yoia that's fair that's fair that's fair
[00:46:10] Yim Miko I actually like y I feel like I
[00:46:12] use her I feel like I use her I can't
[00:46:13] remember if I do but I feel like I do I
[00:46:15] feel like I do I like y my Y is built I
[00:46:17] promise I promise 7,000 gifted if she's
[00:46:20] not geared yep she's not on em stand
[00:46:23] right now because I wasn't playing
[00:46:24] aggravate or some [ __ ] I forget the
[00:46:25] reason but but um yeah literally all
[00:46:28] geared except I removed the EM Sands I
[00:46:29] gave that to someone but outside of that
[00:46:31] fully geared true I was playing some
[00:46:33] like attack build I forget
[00:46:35] why anyways I I I use her I use her not
[00:46:39] bened okay she's not here okay okay I
[00:46:41] I'm coping a little but I think she's in
[00:46:43] like this tier I use
[00:46:46] her ayato okay listen ayat let's say
[00:46:51] like three patches ago right before net
[00:46:53] however many that was
[00:46:56] before nevet I'd say ayo was like uh
[00:47:00] probably here since nevet came out ao's
[00:47:04] like
[00:47:09] um he's in the not he's in the he's in
[00:47:12] the rare
[00:47:16] you what is my AO on right now let's see
[00:47:21] aasa number five in the world right now
[00:47:24] aato number five
[00:47:27] probably you know I could probably make
[00:47:29] it higher but like I'm under a CV emblem
[00:47:32] IO that's [ __ ] it doesn't count so
[00:47:34] technically and this one's on glad so
[00:47:35] technically like top three probably top
[00:47:37] one
[00:47:39] um we'll put him in occasional no he's
[00:47:42] he's rare usage yolan I love
[00:47:46] yolan I love yolan Kookie I love Kookie
[00:47:50] Yan koui that's a full team right
[00:47:54] there
[00:47:56] Hazel uh I agree with whoever was
[00:47:59] cooking and put Hazel next to Barbara in
[00:48:01] the Barbara tier I think that makes
[00:48:02] sense the L you think about it sadly
[00:48:05] those are my last bits I sent you a DM
[00:48:08] showing a bit about my account I hope
[00:48:10] it's good enough let me know anything
[00:48:13] there when you're free if you need
[00:48:14] anything more
[00:48:17] smile okay your account listen we're
[00:48:20] trying to I
[00:48:24] mean your account kind of good which
[00:48:27] isn't like a bad thing than 100 of bits
[00:48:30] but it's like we're trying to fix a like
[00:48:32] [ __ ] account you're just like you need
[00:48:34] to farm more like you just like don't
[00:48:37] have art like you just need to farm more
[00:48:40] so we'll see but I appreciate it anyways
[00:48:44] back to tier list uh
[00:48:47] tanari I like him I think there's some
[00:48:49] potential but he is benched I'm going to
[00:48:51] be honest uh but I think I'm going to
[00:48:52] start playing again for a new guide
[00:48:54] we'll probably make an updated one uh I
[00:48:56] want to experiment with some new teams
[00:48:58] with finina I want to try finina deita
[00:49:01] and then like or finina baiju and then
[00:49:04] like uh Yi or em Ryden stuff like that
[00:49:08] um so we're going to put him in rare
[00:49:09] usage for now my music's a bit loud I'm
[00:49:12] getting a
[00:49:14] headache I just muted it never mind okay
[00:49:18] uh
[00:49:19] Cole

[00:49:32] used he's still
[00:49:35] used I use
[00:49:37] him staff of scarlet Sands best in slot
[00:49:40] thundering Fury best in slot double
[00:49:42] crown best slot ratio 100
[00:49:49] 200 exactly a th000
[00:49:53] defense be honest

[00:50:04] like he's not benched he's not
[00:50:12] benched Candace I don't have her built

[00:50:20] want to do a bloom clear she's she's you
[00:50:22] know not benched I still don't know what
[00:50:24] the difference between not benched and
[00:50:25] occasional usages uh but she's in one of
[00:50:28] the
[00:50:29] two me when I'm
[00:50:31] lying dude sorry I don't want to play n
[00:50:34] against a [ __ ] boss enemy but

[00:50:36] play
[00:50:40] Bloom Nita I
[00:50:46] used Leila not built yet but when she is
[00:50:48] she'll be un benched look I'll make a
[00:50:50] new category
[00:50:54] called
[00:50:57] un
[00:50:58] benched will use them when I
[00:51:03] finish leveling them and it's going to
[00:51:07] be uh
[00:51:09] purple that's an ugly ass
[00:51:14] color

[00:51:19] mostly for exploration but I'll put them
[00:51:20] occasional he's not bench actually no I
[00:51:23] use them all the time to explore I don't
[00:51:24] know if that counts but
[00:51:27] Faron yep next to
[00:51:32] Shia Soo and Scara are not in the same
[00:51:34] tier dude

[00:52:45] we love day in this community ma ma of
[00:52:47] the
[00:52:49] ni um I madean rare usage no I think

[00:52:56] um no he's definitely here I mean yeah
[00:52:59] he's kind of
[00:53:08] benched the piece of me I wish I didn't
[00:53:13] need BYU we love him he's in uh he's one
[00:53:17] of our most use characters since finina
[00:53:18] came out before he was like but with
[00:53:21] Fino we do use him quite a
[00:53:23] bit uh
[00:53:26] cave cave is like alyam without the
[00:53:28] mirrors rare usage but we play him with
[00:53:30] fourar clears from time to time so I
[00:53:32] mean I used them once recently that's it
[00:53:34] I have wasted 11 months now speaking of
[00:53:38] 11 months Kirara has six
[00:53:44] letters benched has eight
[00:53:49] seven 7 + 5 11 that's not true uh Kirara
[00:53:54] is going to is she's not benched uh I
[00:53:56] haven't honestly I haven't used her that
[00:53:58] much recently but I I like her and I
[00:54:00] think I don't know why I haven't used
[00:54:01] her as much I think I've just been using
[00:54:02] ya ya instead I don't necessarily think
[00:54:04] yaa is even better I just I have been
[00:54:06] but uh Kar occasional usage Kirara is
[00:54:08] cool Kar is cool Linny it is
[00:54:12] Showtime uh rare
[00:54:17] usage that's not true I
[00:54:21] I you are the piece of me
[00:54:25] I mean I like Vinnie I just usually play
[00:54:28] what's new man I sure do love an hour of
[00:54:31] Zer gaml
[00:54:34] Bo okay this is what if I rank this
[00:54:37] based on how much I like the characters
[00:54:39] no no it's how much I use them and
[00:54:40] realistically Lenny he's occasional
[00:54:42] Lynette I love you Lynette I'm sorry
[00:54:45] from I'm
[00:54:48] sorry nevet yes
[00:54:50] sir nevet is one of our most used
[00:54:53] characters rizzly he's still used
[00:54:56] he's still
[00:54:57] used um he's still
[00:55:01] used honestly I don't see the point of
[00:55:03] this tier I think we just do
[00:55:06] this and then we delete this tier and we
[00:55:08] put rly
[00:55:12] there okay minus one tier finina hey
[00:55:15] that's a [ __ ] full child team where's
[00:55:16] Bennett where's Bennett there you go
[00:55:18] that's our team okay cool we love
[00:55:20] finina what does she say let the show
[00:55:23] that's not what she says I don't
[00:55:25] remember but she says something uh
[00:55:29] Charlotte we'll use them when I finish
[00:55:31] leveling Navia we use we use Navia not
[00:55:33] benched we use her she's like YULA if
[00:55:36] you didn't want to [ __ ] jump off a
[00:55:38] cliff head first every time you didn't
[00:55:39] crit uh in game
[00:55:41] Chev uh we use mostly cuz she's new but
[00:55:44] I think overload teams rided teams I
[00:55:46] think you can make her work I kind of
[00:55:48] like her I'm going to put her in
[00:55:49] occasional usage or I'll put her in not
[00:55:51] benched I'll put no I'll put her in
[00:55:54] occasional uh Cloud retainer we're gonna
[00:55:56] put her up here and uh gaming not out
[00:55:59] yet we don't [ __ ] know but
[00:56:03] um I just assume he's going to
[00:56:06] be I don't know probably like used he
[00:56:09] looks cool his like animations visuals
[00:56:11] are cool I don't know if he's going to
[00:56:13] be good or not who knows uh Cloud
[00:56:15] retainer I doubt we would ever bench
[00:56:17] because she enable like all we know from
[00:56:19] the official trailer is that she lets
[00:56:21] you plunge so I assume she's Lament but
[00:56:25] how would I
[00:56:26] know
[00:56:28] so do I have too many tears yes
[00:56:32] but these characters are not benched

[00:56:39] yiko that's not y That's [ __ ] Yan all
[00:56:41] of these characters not bench either
[00:56:43] occasional usage rare usage Barbara
[00:56:46] don't want to admit that they're bench
[00:56:47] because I'll use them
[00:56:49] sometimes we'll use them when I finish
[00:56:51] leveling them benched F Yia Sara sorry

[02:44:15] the result if I don't we're going to
[02:44:17] pretend it didn't happen if there is an

[02:44:23] go with a friend go with a family member
[02:44:25] or lover
[02:44:27] her I don't have any of those so I would

[02:45:03] forever but like this is just
[02:45:05] objectively better than invisibility

[02:45:11] intelligence and creativity is pretty
[02:45:13] good too dude why would I I want to be

[03:07:15] I'm going to give sucros a cryog goblet
[03:07:17] and then in four streams when I remember
[03:07:18] that she's on a cryog goblet I'm going
[03:07:20] to be confused but it's okay cuz I live
[03:07:22] in the moment not for the future cuz the
[03:07:24] present is now and the past is the
[03:07:26] present and why would you live in the
[03:07:29] future when you could live in the now
[03:07:31] true get it twisted gamble we're going
[03:07:34] to do this
[03:07:42] piece
[03:07:45] okay Z be [ __ ] yes don't get
[03:07:49] distracted yes
[03:07:51] yes yes yes second half
[03:07:57] Yen Yen where are you
[03:08:02] finina Bennett who's our last slot I
[03:08:06] don't need a shield I have her C4 but I
[03:08:09] kind of like Jong Lee uh against the
[03:08:12] thunder man if of
[03:08:18] [ __ ] yeah we could go more Hydro it
[03:08:21] would make sense to have more Hydro than
[03:08:23] just
[03:08:25] finina um SRO is also technically one of
[03:08:29] the characters in the lantern right
[03:08:30] thing
[03:08:31] so yeah this is not a bad
[03:08:34] idea she mostly charge attacks s isn't
[03:08:37] that great I mean not really you do
[03:08:39] weave in normal
[03:08:40] attacks you're not just charge attack
[03:08:42] spamming you charge attack when you have
[03:08:43] your seals you could also charge attack
[03:08:45] like without them but you are normal
[03:08:47] attacking what is the optimal normal
[03:08:50] attack string actually let me pull it
[03:08:52] up uh it's been a
[03:09:06] while
[03:09:08] Yen play Styles it's been a while n two
[03:09:13] yeah that sounds normal that sounds uh
[03:09:16] uh uh uh
[03:09:25] reasonable N2 n or
[03:09:30] n3c alternatively in the presence of
[03:09:33] sufficient
[03:09:35] Hydro Q N1 C N1
[03:09:41] EC
[03:10:01] okay
[03:10:11] okay
[03:10:13] okay we'll probably do n2c then
[03:10:18] okay I just don't fully
[03:10:21] understand so I mean we'll just play
[03:10:24] relearn it it's been a while um okay I

[04:19:20] [ __ ] okay guys uh thanks for the
[04:19:24] boss
[04:19:29] we holy
[04:19:35] rat thanks for the helpful guides
[04:19:38] nicotine okay don't call me that Flor n
[04:19:40] of
[04:19:44] a dude it's actually
[04:19:47] insane I actually okay I have to talk
[04:19:49] about something really fast I don't know
[04:19:51] why I don't know how genin like allowed
[04:19:54] a character to be as broken as FAL cuz
[04:19:57] think about it okay think about this FAL
[04:19:59] is a character who gives you literally
[04:20:02] AOE Electro damage when she charge shots
[04:20:05] for Oz on top of being able to be ran in
[04:20:07] a hybrid build and then if you get her
[04:20:09] best constellation C1 you can also
[04:20:13] normal attack and all will fire
[04:20:15] coordinated attacks as your official
[04:20:18] normal attacks even if he's not there on
[04:20:19] field so you can build both for Electro
[04:20:22] damage and physical maximizing your C1
[04:20:25] and your A1 passive you don't even need
[04:20:27] to unlock A4 it's literally just this
[04:20:30] and if you get C1 and then she's
[04:20:31] literally best character in the game I
[04:20:33] actually don't get how broken she is so
[04:20:35] be sure to level your fish
[04:20:38] really worth it I created Another
[04:20:40] Universe and founded
[04:20:45] Paradise exactly why I'm a hybrid fishal
[04:20:48] Man
[04:20:54] true okay ignore everything I just said
[04:20:57] but FAL is
[04:20:58] broken that was the only true

[04:29:46] that
[04:29:56] lament

[04:30:01] lemon
[04:30:03] cement is event hard
[04:30:16] no for you maybe what the [ __ ] does that
[04:30:21] mean oh I turned my sounds down cuz I
[04:30:24] was Auto battling and it was tilting me
[04:30:26] it was so
[04:30:28] loud okay that's fine actually it's a
[04:30:30] little bit loud now why is there a crane
[04:30:31] here the
[04:30:34] [ __ ]
[04:30:38] is that
[04:30:39] five um is that skirk yeah I actually
[04:30:44] love this team cuz it lets me play three
[04:30:46] characters that I really like and then I
[04:30:47] heal
[04:30:49] her I wish I could play CFA here too
[04:30:56] though although I usually put Lua here
[04:30:59] but I like wo for Ron to help her get
[04:31:01] her
[04:31:02] alt but L's kind of chill just lay back
[04:31:08] I could also all right we'll start this
[04:31:10] event I might go do simulated Universe
[04:31:12] though CU I I don't farm that [ __ ] off
[04:31:13] stream so a lot of my balls suck like my
[04:31:15] balls and ropes suck cuz every time I do
[04:31:17] like I want to do simers on stream
[04:31:19] thoughts on weathering waves promising
[04:31:21] and it sounds like they're listening to
[04:31:22] their uh users so it might be good if it
[04:31:26] is we'll play
[04:31:28] it uh I'm trying to see if I can get a
[04:31:30] beta key by applying for the beta or
[04:31:34] maybe we'll get sponsored I don't know
[04:31:35] and we'll try it and I'll you know I'll
[04:31:37] let you guys know if it's good or if
[04:31:38] it's bad I hope it's either really good
[04:31:42] or complete [ __ ] I hope it's not in the
[04:31:44] middle like I hope it's either amazing
[04:31:45] and I want to play it or it's like bad I
[04:31:48] don't have to play it I don't want it to
[04:31:50] be like a game where it's like it looks
[04:31:51] good and then like like it's like it's
[04:31:53] like you're like you're like getting
[04:31:54] edged and you can't tell if you're going
[04:31:55] to like it or not and it's like it's
[04:31:57] like good and it falls off so I hope
[04:31:58] it's either really good or I don't have
[04:32:00] to think about
[04:32:02] it TF um
[04:32:06] what are you talking about wait there's
[04:32:08] a lot of games like that where it's like
[04:32:09] good and then after a week you get bored
[04:32:10] and you never play it again I don't want
[04:32:12] it to be that I want it to either be
[04:32:13] really good or really bad don't don't
[04:32:16] give me no like don't get my host up I
[04:32:20] spent 700 hours in Lost Arc and haven't
[04:32:23] touched it since cuz everyone quit and I
[04:32:26] was just like
[04:32:31] well dude I had the name Shia that [ __ ]
[04:32:34] was hard to get
[04:32:42] anyways what is
[04:32:44] this um dude I haven't geared my cely in
[04:32:47] like seven patches I should probably
[04:32:48] play her again when I play you
[04:33:00] again let's play
[04:33:02] RM rap monster where's RM
[04:33:06] hello ma Ron May there she is scent
[04:33:10] plugin ice and
[04:33:13] fire
[04:33:16] energy let's do
[04:33:19] it can you briefly explain HSR please
[04:33:24] okay
[04:33:26] um time to change tactics so you press
[04:33:28] buttons wait why is my [ __ ] bronia F
[04:33:31] wait what the [ __ ] is my bronia
[04:33:34] speed um well I can't check
[04:33:37] here whatever doesn't
[04:33:46] matter you can wait am I stupid oh wait
[04:33:50] what the [ __ ] why did I dude I my eyes
[04:33:53] looked at the crit stuff and then it
[04:33:54] glanced away yeah wait we're actually
[04:33:57] fine we're actually fine we're actually
[04:34:00] fine some value I suppose some value I
[04:34:04] suppose is this is a freeo play Team
[04:34:06] yeah man
[04:34:08] yeah yeah we're playing a freeo play
[04:34:10] Team
[04:34:12] yep yep okay here's star rail then you
[04:34:15] get a bunch of pretty characters and
[04:34:17] then you build them and then you Auto
[04:34:18] Battle and it does stuff for you but
[04:34:20] it's cool cuz the hard content you can
[04:34:22] focus and there's like strategy to it
[04:34:23] right like here I'll be like okay well I
[04:34:24] want a skill like what I did there right
[04:34:26] Auto Battle I would have wasted a br use
[04:34:28] but there I actually made my bronia
[04:34:29] skill point efficient okay but but and
[04:34:31] then for easy content you can Auto about
[04:34:33] it so you don't have to you know think
[04:34:34] too much and yeah my Bron is Turbo
[04:34:36] speeded which is actually really good
[04:34:37] for this
[04:34:40] team receive sa it for your own
[04:34:45] SK Eternal sleep is the Dead
[04:34:49] return pull pretty characters then close
[04:34:52] the game okay
[04:34:56] okay every pedal all will be swept away
[04:34:59] by the wind all will be swept away by
[04:35:01] the all will be swept away in the rug
[04:35:07] avoidable uh probably Auto attack
[04:35:13] here all will be
[04:35:16] revealed in lunar
[04:35:22] flamey
[04:35:25] hard why did you question mark me I just
[04:35:28] quoted The Voice
[04:35:29] line not this
[04:35:31] skill could have saved my Al for the I
[04:35:33] got it red
[04:35:35] look I can my heal for the BR uh buff
[04:35:37] but we got
[04:35:40] it
[04:35:42] there's why are you so calm what the
[04:35:44] [ __ ] do you want me to do we've enter
[04:35:47] the do you want me to be your [ __ ]
[04:35:49] Jester stream while I'm fighting a deer
[04:35:52] in honky star rail that has no chance of
[04:35:54] killing
[04:35:57] me I'll see you off who you think I
[04:36:00] am all will be revealed in lunar Flame I
[04:36:05] look like [ __ ] who do you think I
[04:36:08] am think I'm I show
[04:36:12] Zio oh I probably should save that
[04:36:17] whatever you are Pierro the jester
[04:36:25] okay some value I suppose oh flop things
[04:36:28] are
[04:36:29] gifted this is for you this is for you
[04:36:31] look at this
[04:36:32] damage
[04:36:34] 1417
[04:36:36] ow receive Divinity so this is the Warth
[04:36:39] of life every pedal all will be swept
[04:36:42] away by the way D holy dude she is
[04:36:45] yapping so this is the of Life
[04:36:50] enemy Harmony
[04:36:53] lore to run we've entered the storm to
[04:36:56] guard and defend
[04:37:00] them says you all will be revealed I
[04:37:05] don't Yap as much as Ron may also didn't
[04:37:07] she literally like rufy us didn't she
[04:37:09] literally unless I misunderstood the
[04:37:12] story which I have half skipped didn't
[04:37:14] she literally make give us a [ __ ]
[04:37:16] truth serum yeah and
[04:37:22] okay all will be revealed in lunar
[04:37:31] flame I'll see you
[04:37:34] off
[04:37:36] so you're worse okay I am not worse than
[04:37:40] that P all will be swept away by the
[04:37:45] wind this battle is that is a crime
[04:37:48] nowhere to
[04:37:55] run all will be
[04:37:57] revealed in lunar flame we're going to
[04:37:59] break oh no he's
[04:38:03] not you
[04:38:07] to
[04:38:08] guard she gave us her cake if you think
[04:38:11] about it I'm not thinking about it me
[04:38:14] your
[04:38:15] strength why is HSR so hard it's not
[04:38:17] look hands off we win I was just trying
[04:38:21] to like to like be like in interrogate
[04:38:24] in intrusive not intrusive immersed in
[04:38:27] the game play Lun Flame the hard part is
[04:38:30] what you do before you get in combat
[04:38:32] it's like gearing and
[04:38:33] stuff you have broken five stars I mean
[04:38:36] it's star
[04:38:37] rail why do you think they're so
[04:38:39] generous with
[04:38:41] pulls all will be because in my opinion
[04:38:44] the gap between a lot of the four stars
[04:38:45] and five
[04:38:46] stars is a little bigger than genin so
[04:38:50] save your
[04:38:54] pulls or you can have E6
[04:39:00] QQ at least for carries I think a lot of
[04:39:03] fourstar supports are really really
[04:39:05] cracked I mean like as is good in the
[04:39:07] new mode and stuff
[04:39:09] but a lot of the four stars get way
[04:39:11] better with Idol on too though but I
[04:39:13] think um well that's the same in genin
[04:39:15] so
[04:39:17] yeah gen has three good four stars wa
[04:39:20] what are you talking about yeah that's
[04:39:22] bait I could name like 10 right now
[04:39:24] actually I will yao yao sucros bet
[04:39:26] official sing Cho Shang Ling Bennett uh
[04:39:31] Rosaria Kaa you play Reverse melt very
[04:39:33] easily
[04:39:36] Kirara bro fell for the bait okay I'll
[04:39:39] stop Kookie
[04:39:45] true anyways uh
[04:39:51] Kafka I think yeah I think this I think
[04:39:54] St I'm still
[04:39:56] like catching up on all the STL stuff
[04:39:58] but I think s is really good for like
[04:40:00] really good forer supports and then
[04:40:02] damage dealer wise there's some that are
[04:40:04] really good um but a lot of them get
[04:40:07] like I know QQ is like a lot better with
[04:40:09] Idol on and for the most part I think
[04:40:12] having I actually think having DPSS that
[04:40:15] are five star in this game like carries
[04:40:16] that are five star are is actually very
[04:40:19] valuable like really valuable and having
[04:40:21] multiple for different types of content
[04:40:22] is also very valuable or Jing Leu for
[04:40:24] everything um but yeah and then BR and
[04:40:28] Ron
[04:40:29] may but anyways
[04:40:33] uh
[04:40:35] what was I GNA okay wait Kafka we'll do
[04:40:37] we'll do blade blade BR having at least
[04:40:41] one five star you like healer or
[04:40:43] shielder is really useful too though
[04:40:45] some question mark there's only one DPS
[04:40:47] yeah but not really like in genin I'll
[04:40:48] say okay you only need one DPS and you
[04:40:50] can clear or two DPS you clear
[04:40:52] everything in this game that's kind of
[04:40:53] true but I feel like having different
[04:40:55] DPSS that do different things for
[04:40:57] different types of content helps a lot
[04:40:59] it's like especially with the new mode
[04:41:01] where it's very AOE versus memory of
[04:41:03] Chaos
[04:41:05] obviously you could use Hera there in
[04:41:06] the new mode P the P [ __ ] Pulp
[04:41:09] Fiction
[04:41:16] but like you don't want to be using your
[04:41:18] [ __ ] hunt carry
[04:41:20] there Ed too little lend me your
[04:41:24] strength the fight is set sely does well
[04:41:28] we should try actually I could try s
[04:41:30] there I haven't tried C
[04:41:32] there I guess you could just Spam
[04:41:34] infinite it turns on
[04:41:37] them for I did jinglu blade second half
[04:41:41] in the last
[04:41:43] uh I did jinglu blade instead of a
[04:41:46] audition character and I
[04:41:48] got I ended up getting like instead of
[04:41:50] 40K I got like 28k or something it for
[04:42:00] me it was still enough to get all the
[04:42:02] stars
[04:42:03] but
[04:42:05] E4 Link's better than Bou absolutely a
[04:42:08] blade Knows No Mercy I mean I guess
[04:42:10] unless you really don't care about
[04:42:11] cleansing
[04:42:13] but um Lynx is really really good
[04:42:17] because oh yeah my bronia speed is
[04:42:19] [ __ ] for this
[04:42:22] team actually wait no actually we only
[04:42:24] have Blade no we're fine I just the Auto
[04:42:27] Battle [ __ ] it
[04:42:29] up underestimated you lyx is really good
[04:42:32] though cuz she has um
[04:42:35] she's basically like freeo play budget
[04:42:38] Lua this battle is
[04:42:41] unavoidable lend me your
[04:42:47] strength fail
[04:42:52] to L is the worst character in the game
[04:42:57] true this was typed by someone who lost
[04:43:00] their
[04:43:02] 50/50 good new Eternal SL Dead
[04:43:10] return we've entered the
[04:43:14] storm them is EAS with b d she works
[04:43:17] pretty well the thing with Bao isn't
[04:43:19] that she doesn't work it's just you
[04:43:20] don't have a cleanse so well there's
[04:43:21] another problem that her healing is kind
[04:43:23] of RNG but not having a cleanse is fine
[04:43:27] when it's fine and then she'll heal
[04:43:28] enough but when it's not fine you get
[04:43:31] [ __ ] cuz you really like a lot of
[04:43:33] content like yeah you can run another
[04:43:34] cleanser like BR but it's
[04:43:36] like um a lot of times having multiple
[04:43:40] cleanses or just a Healer that can
[04:43:41] cleanse is really really good this
[04:43:43] combat needs this is double
[04:43:46] speed but anyways
[04:43:51] return for I got to stop reading
[04:43:56] bait it's not worth it strength your end
[04:44:01] approaches we got a chatter that hates
[04:44:03] the w we got Z Jeff who hates
[04:44:07] woo
[04:44:12] take we've entered the storm no he
[04:44:15] doesn't hate her he doesn't hate her def
[04:44:23] them see you
[04:44:27] later he doesn't hate her I just saw him
[04:44:29] put rank her lower than I thought she
[04:44:31] deserved and I don't really understand
[04:44:33] why I feel like she's
[04:44:34] yeah I feel like she's F like she gives
[04:44:37] you energy attack and like like yeah
[04:44:40] she'll need a skill point to press for E
[04:44:43] compared to like Lord night Dad but like
[04:44:45] you get healing and cleansing
[04:44:52] so fail
[04:44:54] to oh that was good
[04:45:00] return that paradise savor it for
[04:45:03] me
[04:45:08] also what I like about wo this battle is
[04:45:11] unavoidable why if my BR attacks BR goes
[04:45:14] again uh we'll do this
[04:45:18] strength we've entered the to guard and
[04:45:22] defend crush them I will dispatch
[04:45:28] you I underestimated
[04:45:33] you
[04:45:36] see you later can I have fun this
[04:45:39] time time for
[04:45:43] a this is double
[04:45:49] speed so I'm supposed to basic attack
[04:45:51] here and not press my skill but like
[04:45:53] eight characters are going that's
[04:45:57] fine uh I don't feel like risking
[04:46:00] it don't be
[04:46:03] scared
[04:46:05] fail
[04:46:06] to wait that was like the best case
[04:46:08] scenario silver wolf proed our blades
[04:46:11] passive unnecessary fa
[04:46:16] to that paradise Savor for
[04:46:23] me eternal St
[04:46:29] return rubber

[04:53:30] this cut through
[04:53:32] the
[04:53:35] Auto battle's dumb yeah it is but it
[04:53:37] doesn't matter like Auto battle's dumb
[04:53:40] but you don't use it for like the hard
[04:53:41] content like I'll do it for like early
[04:53:43] Moc floors although now you can just
[04:53:44] auto start at like seven but me your
[04:53:47] strength we've entered the
[04:53:51] storm them cleanses yeah but I thought I
[04:53:54] was going to go with blade before brono
[04:53:56] did I I don't even remember what turn
[04:53:57] just happened but typically I do blade
[04:54:00] then BR then blade like I'm not bring
[04:54:02] first
[04:54:04] be swept away by the wind wait did I
[04:54:06] just did I Al before a turn started no I
[04:54:08] think your turn already started I don't
[04:54:09] know
[04:54:10] exist I'm half asleep don't talk to me
[04:54:13] right now this battle is unavoidable
[04:54:16] yeah like I basic first and then I go on
[04:54:19] blade your end
[04:54:22] approaches savor it for
[04:54:25] me okay yeah we went
[04:54:28] here woo nice we did
[04:54:32] it
[04:54:34] fail to I love blade
[04:54:42] man old memories on the icy post wait
[04:54:47] what the [ __ ] jaar's here
[04:54:52] eh okay uh we're going to
[04:54:58] do ratio or in bu better
[04:55:01] chat I feel like VI is just better but
[04:55:04] ratio is new and he's ratio and he's
[04:55:09] free ratio okay I'll play ratio I think
[04:55:12] I have him geared
[04:55:14] yeah actually a pretty solid build I I
[04:55:17] don't know why I P for his lyone but I
[04:55:19] mean look at him I
[04:55:21] guess
[04:55:25] ducky okay we'll do ratio with I could
[04:55:27] play topaz actually would make sense or
[04:55:30] we could just do okay well we're playing
[04:55:33] silver wolf no matter what oh P might be
[04:55:36] better if they're AOE like if they're
[04:55:37] both actually no no we're going to do
[04:55:40] silver
[04:55:45] wolf we do silver wolf A Healer and then
[04:55:48] either topaz or Ron may I think I want
[04:55:52] to do Ron may but topaz would be good as
[04:55:57] well just do topaz Ron May that's only
[04:56:00] so my topaz doesn't have E1 and doesn't
[04:56:02] have S1 so she only has one debuff and
[04:56:05] then Ron only has one debuff and ratio
[04:56:08] has one debuff that's three plus like I
[04:56:11] know you can like weakness break and
[04:56:13] [ __ ] but I'd rather just have silver
[04:56:14] wolf here I
[04:56:18] think we could just do
[04:56:26] this that is oh yeah I forgot we could
[04:56:28] just Argent yeah we could literally just
[04:56:30] Argent but we're not going to we're not
[04:56:31] going to we're going to play the new
[04:56:33] character
[04:56:36] character Ron May again ZZ dude okay
[04:56:41] fine if my toaz is built I think she is
[04:56:43] is she
[04:56:45] 7155 and you get more CR with this
[04:56:48] fine fine man wait what the [ __ ] she's
[04:56:50] missing a
[04:56:53] two-piece what did I change the
[04:56:57] Rope wait who has her
[04:57:02] rope oh yeah we need to do inert cell
[04:57:04] sto chat I don't have good inert ropes
[04:57:07] at all I know you can use like other two
[04:57:09] pieces but like my inert cell SoDo is
[04:57:11] like on life
[04:57:14] support it's like critical
[04:57:16] copium let me change lones here I don't
[04:57:19] need this
[04:57:26] one my silver wolf builds a bit cooked
[04:57:30] um yeah this will be fine send plugin
[04:57:34] ultimate damage we don't really I mean
[04:57:36] oh F
[04:57:37] attack weakness break efficiency I
[04:57:39] actually really like that this is also
[04:57:41] fine but I think we going a weakness
[04:57:43] break okay cool should be
[04:57:47] good don't get complacent don't get
[04:57:52] [Applause]

[05:04:43] forgot about the event until like the
[05:04:44] last day and I didn't have time to
[05:04:45] finish it uh even though they gave us
[05:04:47] like 60 days cuz I'm [ __ ] stupid and
[05:04:49] I waited till the last day and then I
[05:04:50] ended up not even finishing it in time
[05:04:52] so I have to like keep doing it after
[05:04:53] just so I could get this phone
[05:04:55] cover anyways uh Cry of the Frozen

[05:05:13] mode you guys are telling me oh my it's
[05:05:16] probably out in the other servers too
[05:05:17] cuz I'm a [ __ ] na loser dude I was
[05:05:21] saying as soon as I started playing Star
[05:05:22] rail there's no reason not to just
[05:05:24] choose the Asia server everything comes
[05:05:26] out earlier and it's not like Ping
[05:05:27] matters in an auto battle game like it
[05:05:29] doesn't matter if anything the Ping can
[05:05:31] help you react cuz like you're going to
[05:05:33] be like delayed right so it's like oh
[05:05:34] like this you see the F you're in the
[05:05:36] past but it's like oh what if I don't
[05:05:38] know what I'm
[05:05:46] saying you'll get Ambush more often I
[05:05:49] mean yeah I guess but who cares I get I
[05:05:52] get ambushed
[05:05:57] anyways all right should we do uh
[05:06:00] simulat
[05:06:01] universe
[05:06:14] D I actually really need Ino like I'm
[05:06:18] going to inert your cth SoDo
[05:06:21] what I I also chucked a bunch of stuff
[05:06:24] in the synthesizer to no avail to no
[05:06:28] avail wait I have 880 what the dude what
[05:06:30] the flip wait let me get a bit more let
[05:06:32] me let me get a bit more uh we're going
[05:06:34] to salvage I was dude I I farmed so many
[05:06:36] relics my inventory is full I had one
[05:06:38] uh, 1500 I have to throw a
[05:06:44] bunch okay let's do 10 let's do
[05:06:47] 10 we have 1,000 we're going to farm I
[05:06:50] think what should we Farm should I
[05:06:54] farm I could farm this set I really need
[05:06:57] I could do like feet or
[05:06:59] body but I'm down to look for ropes I'm
[05:07:04] also going to look for
[05:07:05] balls I don't know if doing ropes is
[05:07:07] like a waste cuz all I want is attack I
[05:07:10] don't want HP I don't want ER I don't I
[05:07:13] don't want
[05:07:17] defense I mean yeah it is worth cuz the
[05:07:20] other domain the other set in this
[05:07:22] whatever the [ __ ] it's called the world
[05:07:24] is bad can you stop talking him trying
[05:07:26] okay sorry uh uh sorry we'll go for I'll
[05:07:30] do four surely we got a good attack open
[05:07:32] for I'll start with the third one HP
[05:07:35] fourth one
[05:07:37] HP dude I mean they're good for blade
[05:07:40] but
[05:07:42] like okay one more one more for the boys
[05:07:45] at
[05:07:47] home
[05:07:49] look I I love ER but not now not
[05:07:55] now dude I have like okay I swear for
[05:07:59] some reason I have like eight ER ropes
[05:08:01] on inert but like one good attack rope
[05:08:03] that's it [ __ ] it I'm doing
[05:08:08] four [ __ ] [ __ ] no oh I mean
[05:08:13] it's it has speed it could be good it
[05:08:16] could be good I
[05:08:22] mean you is best on everyone not on
[05:08:25] inner sto so er on like any of the
[05:08:28] supportive sets is insane but on inner
[05:08:30] salotto you're playing like blade you're
[05:08:32] playing like to well blade can use Ru in
[05:08:33] Arena which is what I'm using but you
[05:08:35] know like like topaz whatever the [ __ ] a
[05:08:37] lot of DPS is so you don't want attack
[05:08:39] usually you can use an off piece yeah
[05:08:41] but this okay I'm going to say it the
[05:08:43] worst part of star rail by far is that
[05:08:46] there's no off pieces I don't care I
[05:08:48] dude it's so annoying sometimes you roll
[05:08:51] like the best most insane [ __ ] Relic
[05:08:53] and you just can't use it like I
[05:08:55] literally have relics that are are just

[05:11:02] [ __ ] again we have like literally 20
[05:11:11] now I actually hate I actually hate
[05:11:15] this at least I'm on rent now but even
[05:11:19] dude my r one sucks my ropes are so bad
[05:11:23] you dude I have a good
[05:11:25] HP on inert salotto why is this on
[05:11:28] silver wolf like I have a good inert HP
[05:11:32] but rud and I
[05:11:43] don't wait do I have a good wind ball on
[05:11:46] inert I think I do what the [ __ ] is
[05:11:58] it I mean I guess I could just go inert
[05:12:01] and then take the go from a bad rope to
[05:12:03] a good rope which realistically is more
[05:12:07] optimal I just don't want to go
[05:12:12] inert I mean yeah like this is probably
[05:12:15] technically better I gain speed though
[05:12:18] which means I don't know if I still line
[05:12:20] up to my
[05:12:21] BR it might actually have made it worse
[05:12:24] if I don't line up what talent level am
[05:12:27] I should probably get this higher
[05:12:30] whatever
[05:12:37] 174 Pepe W yeah ARR I need more crit
[05:12:41] damage on her she's not like optimized
[05:12:43] yet but I'm going full speed so I can
[05:12:45] catch up to this
[05:12:47] guy okay we're going to do a run of
[05:12:51] something what if I do rul Arena and
[05:12:54] broken kill it's so much more efficient
[05:12:55] dude this this so much more efficient
[05:12:57] but I want I need a nerd
[05:13:00] too what do the world
[05:13:02] again oh yeah that one's also really
[05:13:13] good what if I just do
[05:13:22] this okay what what path do you want to
[05:13:24] go chat what path do you want to
[05:13:30] go
[05:13:36] nil
[05:13:38] Elation I've actually never played I
[05:13:41] haven't played Dr ratio here
[05:13:43] yet although I don't think playing him
[05:13:46] against the deer is the best choice but
[05:13:49] probably be fine could do that it'll be
[05:13:53] fine
[05:13:59] ratio I mean we could play him with to
[05:14:03] and
[05:14:06] then like this maybe silver
[05:14:10] wolf imprisonment res yeah but it's
[05:14:14] fine actually we could probably just

[05:38:36] mind wait it's actually pretty good okay
[05:38:38] cool I'm never going to use it but it's
[05:38:39] pretty good is it better than my current
[05:38:40] one for blade 615
[05:38:43] versus uh 812 yes it's actually better
[05:38:46] okay well I'm going to throw this one
[05:38:48] then I mean it doesn't matter cuz my
[05:38:50] blade is going to be on R in Arena but
[05:38:52] this is pretty good for
[05:38:54] now nice got a good piece
[05:38:58] um
[05:39:00] attack yeah that one might give attack
[05:39:02] doesn't
[05:39:03] matter I'll just save both flat HP flat
[05:39:06] HP is useless look at how much HP blade
[05:39:09] has flat HP is nothing compared to
[05:39:16] percent over CA on crit raid maybe we're
[05:39:19] temporary though yeah actually yeah but
[05:39:21] we're this is temporary it doesn't
[05:39:23] matter actually it does matter we
[05:39:26] probably shouldn't use this for now but
[05:39:27] the thing is we're trying to go rudol in
[05:39:29] so so we're trying to go the [ __ ]
[05:39:31] this one I have a rudlin ball where's my
[05:39:32] ball I have
[05:39:34] this which is better for us but the
[05:39:37] problem is I don't have a good a rope on
[05:39:39] the r yet so I don't know what I'm doing
[05:39:41] I mean I guess since we're getting crit
[05:39:42] raate we could still just use this cuz
[05:39:45] now it's like that what the f
[05:39:48] say byebye chat I hope today treats you

[05:43:08] [ __ ] okay I'll filter
[05:43:14] it I'll filter sets that I don't care
[05:43:17] about that
[05:43:28] much
[05:43:36] no select
[05:43:37] all okay this should be
[05:43:43] better [ __ ] it whatever 870 now all we
[05:43:47] need is wait can I get three more n [ __ ]
[05:43:50] it okay if we don't get a good attack
[05:43:52] rope here then [ __ ] the universe is
[05:43:55] against me the universe is against me if
[05:43:56] I don't get a good attack rope here bro
[05:43:59] bro it's not funny anymore it's not
[05:44:06] funny dude dude dude dude dude dude dude
[05:44:08] dude okay well whatever I dude I
[05:44:11] actually can't use a nerell sto I I'm
[05:44:13] telling you I have one good St soda rope
[05:44:16] and then the other one like look my
[05:44:18] jinglu has this okay eight speed's not
[05:44:20] bad I'm going to be honest but that's it
[05:44:22] I have this one and I have this one
[05:44:23] that's it and I put I use this on like
[05:44:26] eight
[05:44:27] characters
[05:44:29] whatever it's
[05:44:30] fine why do you want salot useless no
[05:44:32] Sal is
[05:44:35] good also salotto was the
[05:44:37] 1.0 so salotto has always been out
[05:44:41] basically right so I farmed a lot of it
[05:44:43] which means I have a lot of good balls
[05:44:45] on this set because I have a lot of good
[05:44:47] balls I need good rope for the balls you
[05:44:50] can't have balls without rope so I want
[05:44:53] good rope for the balls and then for the
[05:44:55] other one like Rudin Arena or like
[05:44:57] [ __ ] uh uh
[05:45:00] Glam you might be like oh but Farm these
[05:45:02] they're so efficient yes but the the
[05:45:04] [ __ ] worlds are efficient which means
[05:45:05] both sets are good so they're easy to
[05:45:07] farm whereas salotto the other one sucks
[05:45:09] [ __ ] penis so there's no reason to do
[05:45:11] it so you might as well strongbox the
[05:45:12] [ __ ]
[05:45:14] rope but I don't know maybe I should
[05:45:16] just ignore like [ __ ] say [ __ ] salotto
[05:45:18] but especially for like topaz and like I
[05:45:21] use topa okay I guess topaz I also need
[05:45:23] a ball I don't have a good ball on
[05:45:25] anything for topaz but
[05:45:27] whatever I don't
[05:45:35] know you know the strong box cost 10
[05:45:38] relics yeah it's definitely a
[05:45:43] scam is what it
[05:45:47] is it's a scam but I'm
[05:45:51] addicted maybe we just [ __ ] Farm
[05:45:53] World a and we accept that we're going
[05:45:54] Glam maybe we just accept it but I'm not
[05:45:58] going to go 1 three so here's the thing
[05:45:59] there's also a lot of characters where
[05:46:01] I'm not going to go 135 speed on like my
[05:46:03] blade isn't going higher and then what
[05:46:05] if like yeah my blade isn't going higher
[05:46:08] and a lot of the times the fast BR is
[05:46:10] not going higher and then I mean who
[05:46:12] knows what Sparkle does but what if I
[05:46:14] don't want to go higher if I'm playing
[05:46:15] Sparkle I mean I don't know what the
[05:46:16] [ __ ] she does so there's a decent chance
[05:46:18] that like I don't give a [ __ ] about that
[05:46:20] set even though it is really good uh
[05:46:22] this one's
[05:46:24] nice and then world seven is World s's
[05:46:27] really good this one's good
[05:46:29] but yeah I mean my embi Lune I think is
[05:46:33] on Glam cuz I have a good
[05:46:37] ball yeah that's only I mean okay ignore
[05:46:39] the rest I yed his pieces but he is on
[05:46:41] glamou but like I mean the rope's fine
[05:46:45] wait this ball is not good actually well
[05:46:47] I mean okay never mind attack speed
[05:46:48] never mind yeah it's actually pretty
[05:46:51] good I didn't see the
[05:46:54] attack yeah that's fine anyways okay I'm
[05:46:58] going to end cuz it's been like 6 hours
