[00:24:40] really bad if I don't get it oh my God
[00:24:44] I'm the goat okay okay okay all right
[00:24:46] okay okay all
[00:24:49] right all right daily quote let me close
[00:24:52] chat morning did you read the paper yet

[00:24:59] morning did you read the paper yet
[00:25:04] no all right daily
[00:25:06] ability what the [ __ ] is that you can't
[00:25:08] get that in one you literally
[00:25:12] can't it looks like a bunch of spikes
[00:25:14] though like Kookie e oh it's Kazo
[00:25:20] okay I could have got that L
[00:25:23] key star ra do uh we'll start with acon
[00:25:26] why not acaron uh that was a terrible
[00:25:29] [ __ ] guess maybe ASA terrible [ __ ]
[00:25:32] oh bronia no not Harmony uh
[00:25:36] Gard I don't know what weekly boss he
[00:25:38] uses though he might use these I
[00:25:39] actually don't know maybe it's a newer
[00:25:40] enemy then and not like the The Ice mat
[00:25:42] who's the newer enemy with from this
[00:25:44] [ __ ] area or or that uses this mat
[00:25:46] I'm actually not sure I don't really pay
[00:25:48] attention when I level but it could
[00:25:50] still be jart if he uses the the blue
[00:25:51] mats okay he does cool I just didn't
[00:25:54] know if he used the blue mats but he
[00:25:55] does uh da quote the meaning of a flower
[00:25:59] lies in the duration of its Bloom who is
[00:26:02] a flower
[00:26:04] Bloomer Argent no who blooms flowers I
[00:26:08] feel
[00:26:10] like maybe Black
[00:26:12] Swan no she's not a flower girl I don't
[00:26:18] think the flower lies in the duration of
[00:26:21] its
[00:26:23] Bloom okay let me just listen I want to
[00:26:25] listen to their voice so we'll just
[00:26:26] guess stuff until we have the the the
[00:26:27] the voice and and then we'll listen uh
[00:26:29] it doesn't really matter who I guess
[00:26:31] let's just we'll listen we'll listen
[00:26:32] it's definitely non March Okay let's
[00:26:34] listen let me pause this music all right
[00:26:37] the meaning of a flower lies in the
[00:26:40] duration of its Bloom and not in its
[00:26:44] petals ar oh my the seeds it leaves
[00:26:49] behind Okay this either welth or Lua
[00:26:52] those are that's the vibe I'm getting
[00:26:54] but but but L has like flowers in his
[00:26:57] field right it's [ __ ]
[00:27:00] okay the
[00:27:07] meaning wait his voice is actually way
[00:27:09] deeper in English of a flower that's
[00:27:11] like rare It's usually the
[00:27:19] opposite okay I see you daily ability

[00:32:44] [ __ ] wait this is a burning
[00:32:49] set dude when de comes out this going to
[00:32:51] be
[00:32:53] insane wait this song's hype
[00:32:58] wait what the [ __ ] is
[00:33:03] this is this
[00:33:12] [Music]
[00:33:15] new isn't this her theme yeah but aro's
[00:33:17] trailer didn't even come out did it
[00:33:19] unless you mean like the the old
[00:33:23] one or like the 4.6 thing
[00:33:28] oh like the 4.6 yeah yeah yeah but like
[00:33:30] the AR you know like the actual trailer
[00:33:31] is not out okay okay okay cool I'll try
[00:33:34] to be live for that anyways let's let's
[00:33:36] uh let's Okay so new artifact sets this
[00:33:38] one Buffs burning the other one is
[00:33:39] tailor made for [ __ ] what's yeah
[00:33:41] arino uh let's look at it C thanks for
[00:33:44] 30 months thanks for every other sub
[00:33:45] that I missed by the way I appreciate
[00:33:46] you uh okay unfinished r two piece 18%
[00:33:50] attack four piece after leaving combat
[00:33:52] for 3 seconds damage delt will be
[00:33:54] increased by
[00:33:55] 50% that's a lot of damage B
[00:33:58] 50% hello friendly hello fent thanks for
[00:34:01] four months if no opponents burning are
[00:34:04] nearby for 6 seconds damage bonus will
[00:34:06] increase by 10% per second for more than
[00:34:09] 6 seconds so that's 6 seconds then minus
[00:34:12] 10 10 then- 10 then - 10 then- 10 then-
[00:34:14] 10 for like from 6 to 11 seconds I
[00:34:17] guess when a burning opponent exists it
[00:34:19] will increase by 10 instead until it
[00:34:22] reaches 50 this effect still triggers if
[00:34:25] the character equipping it is off field
[00:34:30] so this a
[00:34:32] 50% damage
[00:34:34] bonus to everything right it's just
[00:34:37] damage dealt
[00:34:42] increased yeah 50% damage bonus if
[00:34:45] you're triggering burning now is burning
[00:34:49] you know kind of questionable yes
[00:34:53] yes yes but
[00:34:59] I mean if you're playing like a vape
[00:35:00] buron like you're doing like retr
[00:35:02] burgeon duuke you could proa I mean but
[00:35:05] you can probably slap it
[00:35:07] on like there's some teams that
[00:35:09] accidentally
[00:35:11] burning but I
[00:35:17] don't there are some like melt like burn
[00:35:20] melt characters like like G and [ __ ] but
[00:35:24] it's like yeah it doesn't buff burning
[00:35:26] yeah but burning damage is nothing so
[00:35:27] doesn't matter like burning doesn't do
[00:35:29] damage we're talking about the
[00:35:30] character's damage would this be good
[00:35:32] this could be triggered on the support
[00:35:33] though what could you put this on like
[00:35:36] who's in a [ __ ] burning like you're
[00:35:37] not going to put this on
[00:35:38] SRO right 50% I mean no but EML gives
[00:35:43] you too
[00:35:46] much
[00:35:47] um you're not putting on Nikita you need
[00:35:50] deepwood I mean unless you have Deo on
[00:35:52] someone else Toma no Toma doesn't do
[00:35:54] damage he burgeons
[00:35:57] and I don't think this is going to buff
[00:35:59] your like transformative reaction damage
[00:36:01] there's no way
[00:36:04] right
[00:36:06] like there's no way this increases
[00:36:11] that I mean maybe but I don't think
[00:36:14] so now it's damage percent yeah that's
[00:36:16] what I'm saying like damage percent
[00:36:19] won't buff like buron or
[00:36:21] Burning uh it could be good for like a
[00:36:24] team that has a random pyro character
[00:36:26] like what if you're playing
[00:36:28] what if you're playing a good team you
[00:36:29] just add Bennett and there's dendro
[00:36:31] there and then you accidentally like
[00:36:32] sometimes you burn is it going to be
[00:36:34] consistent you need to burn every six
[00:36:36] seconds like you need to have an enemy
[00:36:40] burning with less than a sixc window in
[00:36:42] between or like maybe a bit longer than
[00:36:44] six
[00:36:46] but yeah I was thinking of some ayto
[00:36:48] [ __ ] like soup but you would need um
[00:36:51] just say de no but like don't talk to me
[00:36:53] about de but de's usually a support if
[00:36:54] you're playing de DPS you probably want
[00:36:56] emblem anyways
[00:37:03] right
[00:37:05] um yeah for burn M ganu it's just 50%
[00:37:09] damage which is good like that's
[00:37:13] good that's that's basically yeah it's
[00:37:17] basically it would just be better
[00:37:19] reminescence better shaas in that case
[00:37:22] cuz it's for everything even though your
[00:37:24] skill and burst don't matter uh you
[00:37:26] don't you know
[00:37:33] yeah I'm not the biggest fan of Vern
[00:37:34] melt but yeah burning is a DPS loss
[00:37:38] right for most characters like usually
[00:37:39] you don't want to be burning because the
[00:37:41] Pyro's going to eat away at the dendro
[00:37:43] and then it's just like it's
[00:37:44] scuffed
[00:37:50] but yeah you can bur on you you don't
[00:37:53] need to
[00:37:54] though Linny yeah Linny can fit in Linny
[00:37:57] can use like baiju I actually like okay
[00:38:00] I wouldn't go Nita though cuz well you
[00:38:02] can if you don't care about dying but
[00:38:04] Linny will get knocked around everywhere
[00:38:06] when he's Char shotting if you're
[00:38:06] playing Linny Bennett Shang Ling Nikita
[00:38:09] but if you do Linny Bennett Shang Ling
[00:38:12] and
[00:38:14] BYU it's basically mono pyro and you get
[00:38:18] you get to run the set but you can also
[00:38:20] just go Mar on him like you could
[00:38:21] default to Mari anyways so it's not like
[00:38:24] you need this set
[00:38:28] but
[00:38:30] yeah is BYU better than J Le there in
[00:38:32] general no but with this set
[00:38:35] yeah bro ignoring every chat about Shang
[00:38:38] Ling yeah but why Shang Ling has like 86
[00:38:41] sets and you're probably not running her
[00:38:43] in I mean okay if you're running her in
[00:38:46] burning you're like buron you're
[00:38:48] probably not running Bennett like you
[00:38:49] could do like some Bennett changling
[00:38:51] stuff but like if you're actually
[00:38:53] burning or or burgeoning you're probably
[00:38:56] shling might be your solo pyro and in
[00:38:58] that case you need so much ER that
[00:38:59] you're going
[00:39:02] emblem and if you're doing well honestly
[00:39:05] if you're if you're doing buring you're
[00:39:06] going em that's different but you're not
[00:39:07] stacking like you're not going full em
[00:39:11] but
[00:39:13] integrational yeah Nita SRO Ben
[00:39:18] changling or like Flex instead of Nita
[00:39:22] but
[00:39:29] but what is wait let me check what's
[00:39:31] your [ __ ] don't you still need a lot
[00:39:32] of ER in that team let me pull up uh we
[00:39:35] do we do let me check let me check y
[00:39:37] [Music]
[00:39:44] requirements like I feel like you still
[00:39:46] want a lot of ER on that
[00:39:53] team okay I think if if Nikita is your
[00:39:56] on Fielder though I think you can funnel
[00:39:58] particles better than most people will
[00:40:00] tell you you can like I feel like you
[00:40:01] can either even without fav I feel like
[00:40:03] you can like benett es SW the shling a
[00:40:05] bit more often but
[00:40:07] like you'd probably still need like
[00:40:10] [ __ ]
[00:40:11] 200
[00:40:13] um in which
[00:40:17] case emem just gives you so much [ __ ]
[00:40:19] damage whereas the music go sorry
[00:40:30] you get the damage on as long as you're
[00:40:31] not in combat for more than 6 seconds
[00:40:35] um damage d by 50 in combat if no
[00:40:38] burning opponents damage by 10% 6
[00:40:41] seconds I mean yeah but are you doing a
[00:40:43] sixc
[00:40:49] rotation wait actually what if I play
[00:40:52] this and in duuke duuke Melts speedrun
[00:40:56] you kill in one plunge like two
[00:41:05] plunges no but I I assume it counts even
[00:41:07] when you're not on field on duuke which
[00:41:09] means it would by the time you set up
[00:41:11] your rotation it's
[00:41:17] gone but uh okay let's say you're
[00:41:19] playing Shang Ling and you have let's
[00:41:21] say you have what 200 ER not only you're
[00:41:24] getting 20% ER here which is let's say
[00:41:26] equivalent subat the attack sure uh you
[00:41:29] get what like 50% burst damage like
[00:41:32] damage bonus to your burst right if 200
[00:41:36] ER cuz uh 25% would be 100 so yeah 50
[00:41:40] this one is also 50 now you'd be like
[00:41:42] okay this is for everything
[00:41:44] sure but everything for shanglin is just
[00:41:47] re burst like Gua is doing peanuts so
[00:41:50] it's basically the same thing but emblem
[00:41:51] is efficient to farm and this one you
[00:41:53] need to burn so it's it might be
[00:41:55] inconsistent
[00:41:58] and if you're over 200 ER it'll be
[00:42:00] better and if you're under it might be
[00:42:01] slightly
[00:42:04] worse so I'm going to leave this set as
[00:42:06] has potential because it's cool for
[00:42:09] burning but you're probably not farming
[00:42:11] it doesn't the first part stack
[00:42:16] what doesn't the second part stack with
[00:42:19] the first if you're not on
[00:42:21] field well yeah you can um unless you're
[00:42:24] saying 50 plus another 50 that's not how
[00:42:26] it works I don't think think it's damage
[00:42:28] out increase by 50
[00:42:31] if yeah if no burning goes down when a
[00:42:33] burning exists will'll increase by 10
[00:42:35] until it reaches 50 it doesn't say until
[00:42:36] it like plus another 50 it says reaches
[00:42:38] 50 so I don't think that means 100
[00:42:39] that's just 50 if it's 100 it's way
[00:42:41] better but it's it's
[00:42:45] not yeah so I don't like that I mean
[00:42:48] yeah
[00:43:05] and if it triggers when the equipping
[00:43:07] character is off field I assume that
[00:43:08] means if you're in combat even with
[00:43:10] another [ __ ] character it's ticking
[00:43:12] down cuz you're in combat even if it's
[00:43:14] not like you're on cuz yeah that's what
[00:43:15] I assume it means anyways this is the
[00:43:17] real set we have to talk like this is
[00:43:18] the real set which is just [ __ ] I
[00:43:20] assume Arin know set it says Bond of
[00:43:25] Life 18% of attack good I mean obviously
[00:43:28] this is literally Vermillion Echoes boom
[00:43:31] I told you Vermilion bis and air fryer
[00:43:34] wait I was okay I didn't even get to
[00:43:36] talk about this I was thinking maybe
[00:43:37] like some Ayo soup teams where you have
[00:43:40] a djo character like so Ayo Nita kukie
[00:43:45] or Ryden and DEA no you need a Healer so
[00:43:49] uh kukie DEA is unironically a good team
[00:43:52] it's actually a good
[00:43:53] team in that team
[00:43:57] you don't want to give this to your
[00:43:58] emers you don't want to give this to
[00:44:00] kuki you don't want to give this to De
[00:44:01] you also don't to give this to Nita
[00:44:02] because she's on deepwood could ayato
[00:44:04] use it
[00:44:07] yeah that's Curry not soup whatever you
[00:44:10] know what I mean it's a variation of
[00:44:12] soup with D [ __ ] I don't know man why do
[00:44:14] you guys let the Jeff make food need
[00:44:16] team names okay I don't know they're all
[00:44:18] food I don't know but you know what I
[00:44:20] mean it's like yeah
[00:44:25] anyways um fragment of harmonic Whimsy
[00:44:28] so this is the fragment set what is this
[00:44:29] one called unfinished Ry
[00:44:32] okay um two Beast % attack four beast
[00:44:35] when the value of bond of Life increases
[00:44:37] or decreases so that's arleo's mechanic
[00:44:39] uh but I wonder if it interacts with the
[00:44:41] existing bond of Life thing so there is
[00:44:42] Bond of Life on do I did I craft any
[00:44:45] like the Fontan weapons I might have a
[00:44:47] sword I might have crafted the
[00:44:55] sword maybe the bow
[00:44:59] I don't think the B um you have the
[00:45:01] Catalyst wait do
[00:45:03] I I don't think I
[00:45:06] do let me go to the
[00:45:13] blacksmith yes you do wait did I just
[00:45:16] not see it chat one if I'm stupid but
[00:45:20] please don't type it please don't type
[00:45:23] one bro where I have wolf Fang but
[00:45:26] that's what I'm talking
[00:45:32] about the
[00:45:34] Catalyst wow I don't even I lowy don't
[00:45:36] even remember what the catalyst
[00:45:42] is bro am I getting one guide what are
[00:45:44] you [ __ ] yapping
[00:45:47] about it's right there oh I forgot about
[00:45:51] flowing curity okay yeah this one has
[00:45:53] mod of Life uh okay my bad it's level 20
[00:45:57] dude I dude okay what the [ __ ] I have
[00:46:00] this weapon wait when the [ __ ] did I get
[00:46:03] this I'm not even acting I actually
[00:46:06] don't remember
[00:46:08] this wait
[00:46:13] what oh Shan yun's weapon Banner oh that
[00:46:16] was a dark time that was a that was a
[00:46:19] dark time that was a dark
[00:46:23] time okay anyways um
[00:46:27] Mega whale no I'm not no I'm not anyways
[00:46:32] uh yeah so when the value of a bond of
[00:46:34] Life increases or decreases this
[00:46:36] character deals 18% increase damage for
[00:46:38] uh 6 seconds Max Three
[00:46:45] Stacks that's pretty
[00:46:51] good 8 attack was that like 54 8 * 3 24
[00:46:57] yeah 54% damage bonus 54 damage bonus
[00:47:01] plus 18%
[00:47:05] attack I mean yeah this just aro's best
[00:47:08] set right um I scale increased and a bom
[00:47:13] of
[00:47:17] Life can you just use this with
[00:47:19] characters that are running font weapons
[00:47:21] probably right I'd have to test it I
[00:47:23] don't like that it's not out and I can't
[00:47:25] test it but I assume it would work cuz
[00:47:27] it says the value of a bond of life so
[00:47:29] it should work it lasts 6 seconds oh
[00:47:31] yeah it only lasts 6 seconds wait how
[00:47:33] often can you do this once every 10 10
[00:47:36] all is
[00:47:37] clear
[00:47:39] um wait but at last no
[00:47:46] yeah triggered once every
[00:47:53] 10 doesn't work cuz it's not increasing
[00:47:56] SL decreasing ining Bond of Life lasts
[00:47:59] forever can't you just heal though yeah
[00:48:01] can't you just like use this weapon
[00:48:03] shenu q and then it's going to change
[00:48:04] the bond of life is that not how Bond of
[00:48:06] Life
[00:48:11] Works yeah have to heal such small ticks
[00:48:13] yeah to not cap it right wait how much
[00:48:15] is this when the B life is
[00:48:18] uh oh wait no I remember I have to look
[00:48:20] this up cuz it it like it didn't show
[00:48:21] how much a bond of life is you have to
[00:48:23] like look it up
[00:48:29] um where does it show the HP amount to
[00:48:31] like Max
[00:48:33] it it's not 1,000
[00:48:38] HP oh we're 24% of Max HP that's what it
[00:48:41] is wait but no that doesn't that wasn't
[00:48:43] in blue right let me just make sure it
[00:48:45] doesn't
[00:48:46] change yeah no it's
[00:48:49] not okay yeah that's not even that
[00:48:52] that's really not a
[00:48:54] lot and it's yeah that's not a lot okay
[00:48:57] I mean Tech yeah yeah this is arino then
[00:49:00] it work with the Chev cuz she heals like
[00:49:02] [ __ ]
[00:49:05] true yeah or a character with really
[00:49:08] high HP like like like HP uh main
[00:49:11] stat okay this is an arlino set but for
[00:49:13] arlino it's what what did I say 54% 8
[00:49:16] yeah 54% damage bonus and 18% attack
[00:49:19] that's a lot of [ __ ] stats like that
[00:49:21] is a lot of stats um let's say she's a
[00:49:24] polearm uh pyro user who would run I
[00:49:26] don't [ __ ] know a random set let's
[00:49:29] say uh let's just make up a random set
[00:49:31] for no reason let's say glad that would
[00:49:33] be 35% damage bonus just to um normal
[00:49:37] attacks though no you're probably not
[00:49:38] going to normal I don't know what if you
[00:49:40] normal attack on her or not maybe it
[00:49:42] looked like you do cuz her t attack she
[00:49:43] was like floating maybe whatever let's
[00:49:45] say you get 35 from another set here
[00:49:47] it's [ __ ] 54 which is just
[00:49:50] better um and it's to everything
[00:49:53] increase damage that means burst skill
[00:49:55] Auto attack charge attack whatever the
[00:49:58] [ __ ]
[00:50:03] um yeah so that's pretty
[00:50:13] good I mean marish say
[00:50:19] is yeah but
[00:50:24] anyways do you check the weapon wait did
[00:50:26] they the weapon
[00:50:29] stats bro a keen-edged weapon luster
[00:50:32] dazzling as the Crimson Moon it doesn't
[00:50:34] say
[00:50:35] [ __ ] stop typing
[00:50:53] sniffer anyways
[00:50:57] why 4
[00:51:01] months okay I mean this is a good
[00:51:04] set
[00:51:06] um the burning one is well for her it's
[00:51:09] probably not very
[00:51:10] versatile and uh unless they release
[00:51:13] other oh my God that Scythe is massive
[00:51:15] unless they release other characters
[00:51:17] that uh can use Bond of
[00:51:25] life why do we still have a dull blade

[00:55:02] I do I did Broken Keel I did world
[00:55:08] s hi Mr s what's up do you recommend
[00:55:11] pulling B Oru or Linn doesn't care about
[00:55:16] arino or safe for finina okay finina
[00:55:18] clears both BYU and Linny I'm sorry um
[00:55:21] she probably clears arino too but no
[00:55:23] disrespect arino um if you wanted DPS
[00:55:26] Len is pretty decent and if you want a
[00:55:29] support Buu is good with finina in
[00:55:31] particular um I'd say BYU goes up in
[00:55:34] value if you have finina so if you don't
[00:55:35] have finina wait for finina if you are
[00:55:37] have enough to get two characters you
[00:55:38] can get baiju and finina but only if
[00:55:41] finina like if you're going to play byun
[00:55:43] your team don't just pull them and then
[00:55:44] bench him
[00:55:46] right is BYU will be an UPG BYU is an
[00:55:49] upgrade baiju is a side grade to yao yao
[00:55:52] pre uh preina but with finina like post
[00:55:55] Farina he's a lot better well for finina
[00:55:59] if you have time to onfield your ya yaa
[00:56:01] she can be good in those teams too but
[00:56:03] BYU like heals very very
[00:56:05] easily um and
[00:56:11] bursts but like for a lot of teams like
[00:56:14] especially if you don't have finina you
[00:56:15] can just ya yaow and if you do have
[00:56:17] finina and have another good healer CA
[00:56:19] resin have another healer maybe someone
[00:56:21] like uh uh uh shun or you could use

[01:06:26] don't but
[01:06:29] it's it's you could think it's good but
[01:06:31] it's not the
[01:06:35] best I can confirm I was paid by z0x to
[01:06:40] boost his confidence in Brazil it's fine
[01:06:43] maybe I wouldn't know maybe it's the
[01:06:45] same with like KFC apparently KFC in
[01:06:47] like EU or UK or whatever is good but
[01:06:49] here it's like I don't know it's just
[01:06:51] inferior Popeyes here
[01:07:08] Sky Burger King's dead in Egypt wait
[01:07:10] what happened what the [ __ ] happened in
[01:07:13] Egypt
[01:07:27] 07

[01:07:32] stream earlier I named another like 30
[01:07:34] women so I named like 150 dude that's
[01:07:37] actually good like 150 women I basically
[01:07:42] named Every Woman we'll see about that
[01:07:45] no no cap At All by the way
[01:07:56] Zev helped you in the first one no he
[01:07:57] didn't Zev legit said like one name
[01:08:01] unironically he helped with the genin
[01:08:05] characters wait how did I end up in
[01:08:06] Fontan I was doing oh I did a
[01:08:09] daily cool
[01:08:14] it you should read the first Con in
[01:08:17] kazua guide just because this kingms
[01:08:20] I'll click it what is caza's first
[01:08:24] con need
[01:08:26] em yo okay but like it's true for an
[01:08:29] anemo character like yeah like like yeah
[01:08:31] like you need to farm VV em like yeah
[01:08:33] yeah yeah yeah dud D dude it is the
[01:08:36] downside it's just I feel like for hyper
[01:08:39] glom characters it's often times
[01:08:40] overstated it is annoying for like sugr
[01:08:43] or Kaza to get em main stats but you
[01:08:46] don't for sugr in particular you don't
[01:08:47] care about the sub stats kazwa um you
[01:08:50] usually it depends if you have an ER
[01:08:52] weapon you kind of
[01:08:53] don't but um
[01:08:55] you want ER as well maybe some crit rate
[01:08:57] if
[01:09:03] fa anyways why is zos never on the
[01:09:06] banner yeah true
[01:09:08] dude the dam will soon read the full
[01:09:11] statement bro wait what do you mean like
[01:09:14] everything I mean I know it's which are
[01:09:16] difficult to farm that's implied
[01:09:27] High Investments cost level 90 for
[01:09:28] transformative reaction
[01:09:31] damage honestly I don't even agree with
[01:09:33] this one I agree with these like this is
[01:09:35] all true right um but honestly like yeah
[01:09:39] you need to level 90 him that that's
[01:09:41] true cuz you want your swirl to do more
[01:09:42] damage but I feel like level 90 and
[01:09:45] going yeah main stat is like not even as
[01:09:47] hard as like how you would mid Max like
[01:09:50] a
[01:09:54] DPS but but well I
[01:10:02] mean but yeah like it is something like
[01:10:04] some supports you can run like literally
[01:10:06] nothing on and it's fine like I know
[01:10:08] sucros you also want to level for swirl
[01:10:10] damage but I ran my sucros like level 70
[01:10:12] 111 talents for like years and it was
[01:10:15] fine or like
[01:10:17] yeah yeah and VV took me months
[01:10:22] yes yes okay to be dude my ar45 freetop
[01:10:26] playay count strong boxed VV and got em
[01:10:28] but I know that's a low sample size but
[01:10:30] like now you can just strong box it
[01:10:31] right um which is cool so it might still
[01:10:35] take a bit but you don't you no longer
[01:10:36] have to farm
[01:10:43] maidens you also

[01:21:50] crit rate on it but I don't have that so
[01:21:52] I'm not going to I'm not going to do an
[01:21:53] HP circle with sub stats cuz it it just
[01:21:55] makes me look worse even if it's like as

[01:35:26] everybody
[01:35:30] all got learn SK already taught me who's
[01:35:34] P
[01:35:36] who's I guess he's dead I guess he's

[01:35:44] day
[01:35:47] up
[01:35:48] Paradise been fishing all my life for
[01:35:52] the catch sh
[01:35:54] [Music]
[01:35:56] Parise my life for the catch sh
[01:36:01] Parise fing all for the
[01:36:05] [Music]
[01:36:08] sh that's a lot of
[01:36:11] [Music]
[01:36:17] weapons tell me why
[01:36:20] sh is so
[01:36:27] [Music]
[01:36:37] I
[01:36:39] yeah that spear did get better for Shia
[01:36:43] though the uh mildly xenophobic spear
[01:36:46] because Shan Yun is um from Le so sha
[01:36:49] can actually use it better because and
[01:36:50] previously there's no anemo support that
[01:36:52] was from that region only a shenyun well
[01:36:54] Sha but he's not a support so you can
[01:36:56] actually like get more Buffs from this
[01:36:58] what is Discord mod spear the kid spear
[01:36:59] unfortunately I can't get it cuz my
[01:37:00] inauma is still
[01:37:03] raining kidden cross
[01:37:06] bear why don't you Max your shun I
[01:37:08] thought you were Shain I am uh it took
[01:37:10] me like a year to Max my farizon the
[01:37:12] reason why is because Shen yun's Buffs
[01:37:14] don't come from uh not actually Talent
[01:37:17] levels what her Buffs come from are her
[01:37:19] passives so it doesn't actually matter
[01:37:20] that much like yeah it scales on attack
[01:37:23] but like look look at the attack I'm
[01:37:24] gaining I would gain literally two
[01:37:27] attack wo two attack I mean it's base
[01:37:30] attack so yeah percent but still um I
[01:37:34] I'll 90 her eventually I think I just
[01:37:35] needed these the Jades but I'm at 37 so
[01:37:38] I'll get them soon I I I already prearm
[01:37:40] the cloud seam
[01:37:42] scales but we'll just get these what
[01:37:45] about her signature it's level
[01:37:49] 90 also 7 seven if I naturally get her
[01:37:53] to 78 by playing her I'll get her to
[01:37:56] 90 I feel like I got in a lot of natural
[01:37:58] levels on duuke like I don't think I
[01:37:59] manually chose 88 I don't maybe I did I
[01:38:02] don't know why he's
[01:38:05] 88 wait what date did I get the Luke you
[01:38:07] guys want to see date obtained how do I
[01:38:08] check that I'm pretty sure I got the
[01:38:09] Luke like day

[01:57:26] it's bosses and first half uh characters
[01:57:28] with good AOE are good except for cellia
[01:57:30] so whatever good DPS you have will
[01:57:32] probably be good first half unless
[01:57:34] they're like there's a lot of power
[01:57:35] resistant [ __ ] so like I didn't enjoy
[01:57:37] playing duuke first half but I enjoyed
[01:57:38] it second half for example so yeah hyper

[04:04:34] Sunday on a [ __ ] Sunday speaking of
[04:04:36] Sunday we could do the star well not now
[04:04:38] it's like 9 wait how long is the Star
[04:04:40] Quest does anyone know chat who knows
[04:04:42] how long the Star Quest is
[04:04:44] playing the song
[04:04:47] again five to six
[04:04:50] five I feel like it's probably six if
[04:04:52] you guys are saying
[04:04:53] five two the three out it can't be
[04:04:58] three I'm not skipping either how long
[04:05:00] is it if not eight if reading
[04:05:03] everything wait is this real fact check
[04:05:06] six we're not skipping CU we're
[04:05:08] streaming
[04:05:11] it six
[04:05:28] five
[04:05:33] okay so three Auto all they outside okay
[04:05:36] I guess there definitely more than three
[04:05:38] okay okay here's what I think the plan
[04:05:40] is chat hope you enjoyed this stream
[04:05:42] so's a different vibe but shout out
[04:05:44] everyone I played with Toano glitter
[04:05:47] Julie and my friend Alec uh I'm going to
[04:05:49] end now and I'm going to do get I'm
[04:05:52] going to stream both I think we stream
[04:05:55] star for adventurine release cuz it's in
[04:05:56] three days so I might as well do that
[04:05:58] first and genin like we might do genin
[04:06:00] in two days and then star rail in three
[04:06:02] maybe unless I do star rail Then star
[04:06:03] rail again but I think it's probably
[04:06:05] better to do star Rail and then genin
[04:06:06] and then star rail because if not I'm
[04:06:07] doing star star and then genjin I don't
[04:06:09] know up to I mean I don't mind either
