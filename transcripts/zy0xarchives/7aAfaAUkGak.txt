[00:12:20] will not stand for this cried nevette
[00:12:22] you are being treated unfairly swiftly
[00:12:24] in an act of selfless Courage the Hydro
[00:12:26] Dragon renounced his six star and gave
[00:12:28] it instead to siwin promoting her to a
[00:12:30] five-star character such as only fitting
[00:12:32] for the head
[00:12:34] nurse no okay dude I tried to I rewrote
[00:12:38] this like eight times cuz there's not
[00:12:39] enough characters like if I had Twitter
[00:12:41] blue I'd be [ __ ] yapping a [ __ ]
[00:12:43] storm but I don't know there's only like
[00:12:45] 140 dude I'm actually kind of sad I
[00:12:47] expected more uh more seins to be mad at
[00:12:50] me but there's like no one cared well
[00:12:53] not like in a bad way but like I don't
[00:12:54] know like I feel like I made peace I
[00:12:56] feel like it was just like peace reigned
[00:12:57] which is pretty cool
[00:13:02] I someone else's joke wait how do how
[00:13:05] the [ __ ] would I know okay I I mean the
[00:13:07] nevet six-star thing is like a pretty
[00:13:09] common joke but this I there's no way
[00:13:11] someone already wrote there's literally
[00:13:12] I crafted this in the [ __ ] bathroom
[00:13:14] oh [ __ ] heo I crafted this and the
[00:13:16] [ __ ] like I was

[00:13:40] know I just wasn't feeling it so B uh
[00:13:43] but I feel better we're chilling uh also
[00:13:46] I was thinking about it I was like dude
[00:13:47] I kind of like imagine the content if I
[00:13:50] actually tried to get 1K achievements
[00:13:51] before Nat land Loki is probably too
[00:13:53] late yo yo if I had like 900 but okay it
[00:13:57] might still be good content so we might
[00:13:58] do like one or two achievement hunting
[00:14:00] streams but if if I don't know man it
[00:14:02] might be it might be cooked cuz I don't
[00:14:04] let anyone else on my account so I when
[00:14:06] I play I like stream it or I'm like off
[00:14:08] stream but like dude
[00:14:10] I I don't
[00:14:13] know well I want we'll see we'll see is

[00:14:35] okay that's why also I was playing
[00:14:37] valerant earlier that's probably why um

[00:14:45] [ __ ] ton those are the worst for me cuz
[00:14:47] they're not hard like you get a lot of

[00:14:50] stream it cuz it's kind of boring and I
[00:14:52] don't want to do it off stream CU it's

[01:18:34] okay okay at least for the guy cat
[01:18:36] owners I know like 82% of them are just
[01:18:39] like [ __ ] boys who use it to like send

[01:28:41] check let me check you I mean it's
[01:28:44] doable but I will I actually think I
[01:28:46] should 90
[01:28:47] him cuz he does aggravate so it does
[01:28:50] matter oh but dude I just spent like a
[01:28:52] week farming for this [ __ ] man

[01:29:05] right e charge out Q yeah I know you
[01:29:07] can't but does it even matter and at
[01:29:09] that point What's the difference between
[01:29:10] e charge q and EQ instantly like what's
[01:29:13] the point of the one charge before Q
[01:29:14] does it actually do anything cuz then
[01:29:16] you lose your funnel particles
[01:29:28] A1 can I be honest I don't remember what

[01:45:04] deposit okay never mind uh I'll play
[01:45:07] this uh I'll just play
[01:45:11] sh why so many quests
[01:45:14] okay I don't okay whenever I'm playing
[01:45:17] genon off stream unless I'm like
[01:45:18] recording or testing like a character it
[01:45:20] feels like I'm like wasting my time cuz
[01:45:22] I'm like I could just be streaming this
[01:45:24] so for a lot of quests it's like I don't
[01:45:25] want to stream them cuz there's better
[01:45:27] content to stream but then I don't want
[01:45:28] to play it off stream cuz I'm like I
[01:45:29] could be streaming genin so I it ends up
[01:45:32] in a vicious cycle where I just never do
[01:45:33] them unless it's like a good qu like a
[01:45:35] archon quest and I'll stream it like
[01:45:37] that's why I did the 4.7 archon
[01:45:39] Quest

[01:49:50] going to need uh this is a crit circlet
[01:49:53] I don't know why I didn't level this so
[01:49:54] let's do a quick plus4 see what it gets
[01:49:56] maybe em maybe ER maybe flat defense
[01:49:58] okay flat defense awesome all right and
[01:50:01] then it rolls into HP okay this is
[01:50:02] definitely a fun game I I love rolling
[01:50:05] artifacts maybe just give me another HP
[01:50:06] roll while you're at it o crit damage
[01:50:08] okay that's good that's good uh let's do
[01:50:10] another roll see what
[01:50:12] happens roll roll flat attack for me see
[01:50:14] what happens okay HP uh I mean maybe
[01:50:18] like Bond of Life Hut I don't know I
[01:50:20] don't know
[01:50:23] okay I
[01:50:27] mean
[01:50:29] Suk I don't even know I mean it's like
[01:50:31] an off piece I guess but you just said
[01:50:34] you won't keep
[01:50:35] mid
[01:50:38] yeah
[01:50:40] sure fine okay what
[01:50:45] about FEA wait this could be good double
[01:50:48] crit hp% watch it gets attack here
[01:50:51] [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just
[01:50:53] just roll defense why don't you just
[01:50:55] [ __ ] roll defense get it over with
[01:50:56] yeah just roll
[01:50:58] HP yeah yeah yeah just roll defense just
[01:51:01] do it just do
[01:51:05] it okay that feather is gone um wait
[01:51:09] wait we're not done let's look at like
[01:51:10] one set at a time okay um these flowers
[01:51:13] could be good but I think I already have
[01:51:14] really good flowers so I could be a bit
[01:51:15] more picky like well that's a Max
[01:51:18] roll okay well we'll test them whatever
[01:51:24] flat
[01:51:25] [Music]
[01:51:28] attack okay uh this could be good a Sans
[01:51:31] okay I actually need a good Sans on the
[01:51:32] set my arino spoiler alert to the video
[01:51:34] I uploaded today we got a good build for
[01:51:36] her but her Sans is lacking
[01:51:41] okay okay
[01:51:47] um what other set should I look at flop
[01:51:50] St lock
[01:51:57] okay [ __ ] this
[01:51:58] piece we could throw this piece away
[01:52:00] unless it gets like 40 crit damage but
[01:52:02] that's not going to happen yeah okay
[01:52:06] um do I have a good
[01:52:08] ciret oh double
[01:52:16] crit okay but there's a high likelihood
[01:52:18] that I like never use this set there's a
[01:52:20] high likelihood that even if we get a
[01:52:22] few future dendro character I just play
[01:52:24] the dendro support set I don't know I
[01:52:26] mean maybe I don't know what the [ __ ]
[01:52:27] people are going to use we'll level this
[01:52:29] see what we get plus
[01:52:30] 4 HP
[01:52:40] percent I I'm going to keep this at
[01:52:43] plus4 I don't think we're using that
[01:52:46] man man I mean okay this could get crit
[01:52:49] rate and then no one will be laughing
[01:52:51] anymore I mean you're laughing now but
[01:52:52] you'll stop laughing no you won't okay
[01:52:54] that's fine maybe we'll get
[01:53:01] um I don't even know what I'm
[01:53:04] doing okay [ __ ] this geog Goblin I don't
[01:53:07] care also [ __ ] this em goblet I don't
[01:53:12] care lowkey the circl could be
[01:53:15] good give something good give be
[01:53:17] something good HP I mean it could still
[01:53:19] be
[01:53:20] good no it can't
[01:53:25] [Applause]
[01:53:28] okay what if I went in strong box oh
[01:53:31] what if I went in strong box for million
[01:53:33] right
[01:53:35] now say I won't say I won't see what the
[01:53:38] [ __ ] happen sayah
[01:53:43] won't oh no but we didn't because we
[01:53:46] said we were saving for Nalan strong box
[01:53:48] that's a free video whatever the sets
[01:53:50] are boom I geared my my alham with the
[01:53:54] new strong box plus one skeleton yeah
[01:53:57] okay we shouldn't we
[01:54:01] shouldn't
[01:54:09] [ __ ] okay lowkey though would you guys
[01:54:11] be mad at me if I leveled this double
[01:54:12] crit this has to be good do I already
[01:54:14] have a feather on the
[01:54:19] set I do what the [ __ ] is this okay okay
[01:54:23] let's just play the
[01:54:26] game that's like the best feather I've
[01:54:28] seen in my life and it's on [ __ ] a
[01:54:30] random ass
[01:54:34] set could you imagine if it was on a a
[01:54:36] set that's good for every character like
[01:54:38] echo or Vermilion sorry if you're new
[01:54:40] and you're watching the stream I assume
[01:54:41] there's at least a few new players
[01:54:43] watching please don't Farm Vermillion or
[01:54:45] Echoes okay regardless of who you play
[01:54:47] and what you m and who you watch don't
[01:54:50] make the same mistake I do okay please
[01:54:51] take it for me please take it from me
[01:54:54] okay don't do it okay don't do
[01:55:02] it thank
[01:55:05] you too
[01:55:10] late isn't Vermilion 18% attack on the
[01:55:13] two-piece yes but now you're starting to
[01:55:14] sound like me okay this is when you know
[01:55:16] you're too far gone in the copium 18%
[01:55:19] attack is a universal two-piece however
[01:55:21] it used to be a rare one now it's on
[01:55:22] many sets furthermore there's a lot of
[01:55:24] really good there's like artifact set
[01:55:25] Power creep lowkey like it depends on
[01:55:27] your account but if you have like finina
[01:55:28] you can M CH say everyone plus like it's
[01:55:30] not really best in on like anyone but
[01:55:32] also like kind of but like Vermilion is
[01:55:35] like the two is versatile but like
[01:55:38] there's also more HP scalers now and
[01:55:40] also like like like there's so many
[01:55:42] other sets that are versatile like if
[01:55:43] you just Farm emblem and reminescence
[01:55:45] the reminescence two piece is versatile
[01:55:47] and then you don't need Vermilion but I
[01:55:49] need
[01:55:50] Vermilion Z listen to n's practice voice
[01:55:53] line okay I
[01:55:57] will okay this attack OB could be good
[01:55:59] but if it's cringe you're
[01:56:09] bad also let me change my game
[01:56:12] language cuz I can't
[01:56:18] read
[01:56:20] character NE profile voice
[01:56:24] over first get into position like this
[01:56:27] okay B him B him B him ban him like like
[01:56:31] what what takes your [ __ ] like how
[01:56:33] deep in the cummer brain you have to be
[01:56:35] to to to go through this and then type
[01:56:37] it in my
[01:56:38] chat take a deep breath relax the
[01:56:41] weather Thunder is kind of sunny days
[01:56:44] are so warm and cozy good morning uh
[01:56:49] remember sometimes you can convey me
[01:56:51] okay to be fair though click on any
[01:56:53] Navia voice
[01:56:54] Line This is not scripted content click
[01:56:56] on literally
[01:56:57] anyone oh I was lucky wait okay maybe
[01:57:00] not the about ones quick okay never mind
[01:57:04] in I
[01:57:05] do nice to meet you my time with this
[01:57:08] maybe okay never
[01:57:11] mind I don't get it I don't either it's
[01:57:15] not what I
[01:57:16] thought M sock is a kaching quick Bloom
[01:57:18] team viable yes but don't have too much
[01:57:20] Hydro like you can use like
[01:57:22] I like I was going to play on my freeo
[01:57:24] Play account because I use Barber like
[01:57:25] my I don't have many healers so Barbera
[01:57:27] there is fine like I like just quick and
[01:57:29] better usually uh with like a ya Yao or
[01:57:32] something but you could do like
[01:57:34] especially lowbudget teams like like
[01:57:35] freeo play teams you could do um like a
[01:57:39] Barbara and then you just get a bit of
[01:57:40] bonus hyper blooms that'll do like I
[01:57:42] don't know 25 30k for free as long as
[01:57:45] there's not too much Hydro that you're
[01:57:47] like losing the dendro so it's not bad
[01:57:49] Ki could do it too
[01:57:55] you never play that account I know man
[01:57:57] but but it's cuz Okay honest to God I
[01:58:00] genuinely think I'd be playing that
[01:58:01] account right now if they didn't release
[01:58:03] like six gotcha games bro i' I've been
[01:58:06] play like I have to do dailies on like
[01:58:07] eight accounts or eight
[01:58:19] games dendro crit damage
[01:58:26] just hire someone
[01:58:30] me me
[01:58:41] me wait should we open this
[01:58:49] chat can we get a gamma going maybe what
[01:58:52] said we get more of thoughts also what
[01:58:55] was I about to
[01:58:56] do um I was about to do something I just
[01:58:59] don't know what the [ __ ] I was going to
[01:59:03] do oh can
[01:59:07] resin 1,000 achievements okay
[01:59:10] realistically chat I think if I'm 100
[01:59:12] achievements away I think if I can get
[01:59:14] 900 getting to 1,000 is easy because I
[01:59:17] would do like a I could make that at the
[01:59:18] content and I'd be motivated but going
[01:59:20] from
[01:59:23] going from [ __ ] T to T going from 800
[01:59:26] to 900 is like depressing one ver milon
[01:59:29] strongo for the morale
[01:59:34] boost okay oh that's what I wanted to do
[01:59:37] I want to level my attack
[01:59:47] allet sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
[01:59:50] sorry sorry sorry
[01:59:55] sorry man I'm
[01:59:59] sorry okay um dude it's it's one it's
[02:00:04] one um um um um Vermilion no let's not
[02:00:08] do Vermilion let's do something new what
[02:00:11] if I do flop [ __ ]
[02:00:15] it no I don't want to do
[02:00:18] flop flop is for
[02:00:20] losers I'm not a loser I farm
[02:00:25] Vermilion
[02:00:28] um do voru Kasha for the
[02:00:33] boys honestly vasha is not even bad I
[02:00:36] just don't want the other set like I
[02:00:38] don't want [ __ ] nighttime Whispers In
[02:00:39] oh wait this is song of days past wait
[02:00:41] vasha wait I'm thinking of the wrong set
[02:00:43] is vasha this one wait uh the the blue
[02:00:45] one right where the [ __ ] is the vasha
[02:00:47] domain it's like in the desert oh this
[02:00:49] one nyss vasha
[02:00:53] bro I was singing of [ __ ] uh song of
[02:00:55] days pass song pass is good I don't want
[02:00:56] the other set fukasha this is uh this is
[02:00:59] a two-piece only type of
[02:01:06] set I've been in the vasha mine for
[02:01:14] weeks twitch user Jamies explain
[02:01:17] yourself right now why the [ __ ] were you
[02:01:19] in vasha explain yourself right right
[02:01:22] now future Dain is not even good for dea
[02:01:24] it's it's okay but it's like as good as
[02:01:26] emblem plus you can use mag with finina
[02:01:28] plus instructor is better as a support
[02:01:30] or MTH so oh disregard that again keep
[02:01:32] that out of your mouth okay
[02:01:42] explain
[02:01:46] Sask okay
[02:01:55] you can't be serious with emblem
[02:01:57] DEA okay the the damage C from her burst
[02:02:00] it's like barely better to go V Rasha
[02:02:03] plus emblem gives you ER Plus it's
[02:02:05] approximately and excuse the
[02:02:06] approximation 6.54 62 times more
[02:02:09] efficient to farm so like why would I
[02:02:11] [ __ ] farm for a vasha set two Beast
[02:02:14] is
[02:02:16] good but also that's like if you're
[02:02:18] trying to do damage on De which you
[02:02:20] shouldn't like granted you should be
[02:02:22] playing like instructor or MTH or like I
[02:02:26] don't know like golden
[02:02:27] [Music]
[02:02:40] troop or a different character okay dude
[02:02:43] stop slandering DEA we are de enjoyers
[02:02:46] in this chat room you know what I'll
[02:02:48] play de right
[02:02:50] now you're going to be like wow they
[02:02:52] truly carried you got a job for
[02:02:55] me look is she good no but is she pretty
[02:02:59] yes okay let me oh [ __ ] I have to do the
[02:03:01] prediction okay I'll did have
[02:03:08] this here the
[02:03:10] C okay
[02:03:12] [ __ ]
[02:03:18] well pitiful
[02:03:25] M de is actually so good with Lenny okay
[02:03:26] so good is a bit of a stretch but yes
[02:03:28] she can be played with Lenny the main
[02:03:30] problem with Lenny and and I I actually
[02:03:32] played her with Linny in the small times
[02:03:34] I played Linny uh the the only problem
[02:03:36] is like you either because de's up time
[02:03:39] on her e is uh mediocre at best like it
[02:03:43] just wore off you're either eating away
[02:03:45] at your Bennett's up time if you use it
[02:03:46] after Bennett to get longer resistance
[02:03:48] interruption or you use it before
[02:03:50] Bennett but then you lose out on time
[02:03:52] for Linny so you might get interrupted
[02:03:53] when you're charge shotting so it's like
[02:03:55] a bit annoying it's fine though it's
[02:03:56] fine though it's just a bit
[02:04:04] annoying
[02:04:07] wait wait this wait wait wait this could
[02:04:10] be
[02:04:10] good
[02:04:15] hello this could actually be good wait
[02:04:17] let's level it for who dude dude dude

[02:04:23] character who is burning wait wait let
[02:04:25] me level it let me level

[02:19:03] I'll be out [ __ ] drinking I don't
[02:19:04] know like I don't want to be [ __ ]
[02:19:07] whatever I mean the timing is
[02:19:08] weird but yeah it's it's so my birthday
[02:19:11] is August 15 this is midnight like as
[02:19:15] like it's like the start of the 16 and

[02:19:22] 15 I don't know there's always something

[02:19:30] live
[02:19:32] already also I think the waa patch is
[02:19:35] around then too like around 14 15 16 so
[02:19:39] I don't even know what's happening
[02:19:41] but yeah so I'll definitely be live cuz

[02:19:46] stream a [ __ ] preview patch but also
[02:19:47] it's my birthday so I don't know what
[02:19:49] we're going to do
[02:19:51] I don't know s 7
[02:19:54] months alcohol is bad for bald people
[02:19:57] okay first of all alcohol is bad in
[02:19:58] general but but I I'm not bald okay and
[02:20:01] and I don't like like what are you
[02:20:04] [ __ ] talking about okay why would you
[02:20:05] even type that in my chat do you think
[02:20:07] it's another streamer maybe but not my
[02:20:10] stream like that message might make
[02:20:12] sense if your streamer's bald but it
[02:20:13] doesn't make sense in my [ __ ] chat
[02:20:14] cuz I'm not bald and I'm not
[02:20:17] balding alive everybody stand back one
[02:20:21] with wind if you're not bald then tilt

[02:21:12] title you should look up thin hair the
[02:21:14] league on YouTube why would I ever look
[02:21:17] that up
[02:21:22] do donated $5 can you please look at my
[02:21:26] H and ioka and help in Max them
[02:21:31] 63,5
[02:21:39] 7,343 I looked it up what you want me to
[02:21:41] click on here
[02:21:52] oh doler thanks the oh [ __ ] minus
[02:21:55] $10 okay fine I'll look okay but what
[02:21:58] type of a question is look at my Hut and
[02:22:00] AA and tell me which one's better like
[02:22:02] what do you even want me to
[02:22:04] say
[02:22:06] Hut thanks for
[02:22:15] watching AA is good in content where
[02:22:18] shit's freezable like the current Abyss
[02:22:20] you can play IA team it kind of depends
[02:22:22] on the content uh she's fine in mono
[02:22:24] cryo but okay I can look you up though
[02:22:26] I'm not going to minus 10 what is this
[02:22:29] 6034 60
[02:22:32] 34 uh all right let's see Doppler ar60
[02:22:38] Chong Yun M which is concerning because
[02:22:40] you don't have Chong Yun on your profile
[02:22:41] you said aaka or Hut I assume this is a
[02:22:44] flex given that you're ar60 and not
[02:22:46] someone who actually wants advice but
[02:22:48] let's look uh 228 em who h
[02:22:55] r okay well now you have to be C6 right
[02:23:04] okay at least he's triple crowned I
[02:23:06] respect that Crimson witch that's
[02:23:09] a very good
[02:23:14] flower very good
[02:23:16] feather okay I I see where this is going
[02:23:19] honestly okay I'm going say it if you're
[02:23:21] going to whale at least build your
[02:23:23] character properly and you did so I
[02:23:24] respect it it's a good hotel never mind
[02:23:27] I mean you have C6 so you get like the
[02:23:28] crit rate thing but it is comical that
[02:23:31] you're 63 crit rate however it is a good
[02:23:33] Hut
[02:23:43] um B all right
[02:23:46] Yan I've I've I know I've asked you
[02:23:49] multiple times for different numbers but
[02:23:51] a six would genuinely make my day it
[02:23:54] would genuinely make my
[02:23:56] day not better but help where am I
[02:23:59] lacking in sub stats what do you mean
[02:24:00] you dude you have like damn near perfect
[02:24:03] Subs typically I'd say [ __ ] balance
[02:24:05] your crit ratio but I I assume C6 Dow I
[02:24:08] mean I C6 Dow like changes it a little
[02:24:10] but you still want a high crit rate even
[02:24:12] with C6 okay we got a three
[02:24:15] unlucky what about your
[02:24:18] AA wait
[02:24:22] honestly your attack's a little
[02:24:24] low um
[02:24:32] like yeah like obviously this AA is
[02:24:34] really good but you can definitely go
[02:24:36] attack ciret or yeah probably ciret um
[02:24:40] just because especially with like a
[02:24:41] refined Mis spitter but you it's
[02:24:43] honestly fine you have 130 ER High crit
[02:24:46] ratio you could get more like let's say
[02:24:48] you have an attack circuit that has
[02:24:49] better sub like these subsets they're
[02:24:51] not bad attack's good ER is good but
[02:24:53] like if you had attack with like double
[02:24:55] crit ER it just be
[02:24:58] better
[02:24:59] yeah definitely still good
[02:25:05] though y why are people okay I guess
[02:25:07] we're just [ __ ] doing uid reviews why
[02:25:10] I bro I you I said if you don't know I

[02:26:10] piece which
[02:26:11] I okay it's attack I was about to

[02:26:17] [ __ ] that's a good show um
[02:26:20] um it's a bit

[02:26:30] if you have cuz shadow gets a lot of
[02:26:31] damage sources but you are running
[02:26:33] double attack like two piece attack two
[02:26:35] piece attack it's it's fine if your subs
[02:26:37] are way better but anemo would be better
[02:26:39] there unless well yeah
[02:26:44] yeah everything else is fine though
[02:26:59] finina helps yeah but also like shenyun
[02:27:02] does like I don't know what your team is

[03:02:42] XP
[03:02:44] um well let me just say let me just tell
[03:02:47] you
[03:02:51] welcome to got dude I think the worst
[03:02:54] I've ever gotten punished for leveling
[03:02:55] something was like when I leveled okay
[03:02:57] they kind of made it better cuz they
[03:02:59] gave us [ __ ] and they reduced the cost
[03:03:00] of money but when I started playing
[03:03:02] [ __ ] Wawa and you level an echo to 20
[03:03:05] or like 25 it feels like I don't know
[03:03:07] dude it felt like my account got like
[03:03:10] stripped of every resource
[03:03:22] I feel like every I don't know actually
[03:03:24] I don't play enough gotcha games but all
[03:03:26] the ones that I've played which is like
[03:03:27] five actually no dude Cookie Run no

[03:03:34] a cookie house mid maxer but like the
[03:03:37] main thing I had like no cookie XP my
[03:03:39] whole life so I feel like I feel like
[03:03:40] that's usually a bottleneck but I I gen
[03:03:42] is a lot of characters you don't need to
[03:03:44] level fully a lot you do now like for
[03:03:46] like dendo reactions [ __ ]
[03:04:01] but you're a gotcha
[03:04:11] tourist okay it was definitely a mistake

[03:14:24] I'll give you guys my opinions because
[03:14:26] I'm not a scammer uh Navia unironically
[03:14:29] like in my opinion and I don't really
[03:14:33] care too much about like her lore I
[03:14:36] think she's like five out of five
[03:14:37] because she's actually a good Geo
[03:14:39] character and is satisfying to play and
[03:14:41] has free to playay Friendly teams and uh
[03:14:43] uh I don't know I just think her like
[03:14:45] it's kind of like a Ula but instead of
[03:14:47] like it being your burst that you have
[03:14:48] to hit it's a skill and it's a lot like
[03:14:50] cooler not cooler but like less annoying
[03:14:54] I actually like nav lot ch's cool but
[03:14:56] she's kind of just albo 2 so a bit not a
[03:14:58] five uh and then G is
[03:15:02] G but I I I do really like Navia
[03:15:04] actually but okay how do I reroll this
[03:15:06] you just close it and
[03:15:09] reopen read the question it said am I

[03:18:40] bow and so I lit up a firework in my
[03:18:44] friend's house and let's just say that
[03:18:46] no
[03:18:47] one talks poorly about my queen just
[03:18:51] kidding she's probably like I mean I
[03:18:52] like her like I mean like play style
[03:18:55] wise somewhat dislike but like game like

[03:19:11] following aspect okay I'm I'm going be
[03:19:13] okay look honest man honest man
[03:19:15] characterization and story line line I'm
[03:19:17] not going to lie I'm not the there's
[03:19:18] some lore I really pay attention to like
[03:19:20] archon Quest and then there's others
[03:19:22] that you know I'm mashing through okay
[03:19:23] all good uh I do you know she's like a
[03:19:25] friend of the arinara she's pretty
[03:19:27] wholesome so characterization I think
[03:19:29] she's cool art and visual elements I
[03:19:31] also think she's
[03:19:32] cool um you know what I'll click this
[03:19:35] one voice acting hey
[03:19:39] okay okay great great job great job
[03:19:42] great job combat strength
[03:19:48] sorry uh combat
[03:19:51] strength look okay
[03:19:57] um open world okay she's not like bad
[03:19:59] she's not bad she's just not she's like
[03:20:02] okay she's basically like cuz the thing
[03:20:05] is Hut came out before her like if it
[03:20:07] was yoia into Hut You' like okay you
[03:20:09] know gotcha game they make the next like
[03:20:11] single Target pyro better than the last
[03:20:13] one I get it but if it's like the like
[03:20:16] Hut came
[03:20:18] first she's not bad she's just not like
[03:20:21] particularly
[03:20:24] good that's all that's all that's all
[03:20:27] okay I'm going to say combat strength
[03:20:28] I'm going to say somewhat unsatisfied
[03:20:32] open world mechanics I'm going to
[03:20:36] say I'm G to open world mechanics
[03:20:39] um honestly I think the fact that her
[03:20:42] burst and
[03:20:44] skill don't really have much like
[03:20:47] cohesion kind of tilts me uh she is pyro
[03:20:51] is definitely good for Overworld I agree
[03:20:54] you can like light actually she can Farm
[03:20:56] specters easily okay open world
[03:20:57] mechanics true she can actually like
[03:21:00] [ __ ] up specters and [ __ ] which is which
[03:21:01] is
[03:21:02] nice all right do you own Yia yes what

[03:23:32] other Yia na I mean sorry [ __ ] kokomi
[03:23:34] Nation
[03:23:36] enjoyers um like I heard they did her
[03:23:38] dirty combat strength like my
[03:23:41] understanding of kokomi is like kind of
[03:23:43] badass
[03:23:44] General like War leader like [ __ ]
[03:23:47] leads the water nation and then in the
[03:23:49] story Quest she was kind of just like
[03:23:51] oooo traveler but I was like I'm I don't
[03:23:54] want to her to ruin I don't want to ruin
[03:23:56] my image of her so I didn't do the story
[03:23:59] Quest but I love kokomi comat strength
[03:24:02] very good voice acting very good art and
[03:24:05] visual elements probably the bet I mean
[03:24:07] probably her strongest
[03:24:09] element bro just listening to
[03:24:12] anybody okay well I'm not I'm going to
[03:24:14] do neutral I'm going to do I don't
[03:24:16] remember didn't pay attention thoughts
[03:24:19] okay do you own Ki yep what were your
[03:24:22] motivation um art IND visual elements I
[03:24:26] mean like now it would be strength at
[03:24:28] the time I was just like to test
[03:24:31] her
[03:24:33] um boom
[03:24:35] boom
[03:24:37] boom do you have any feedback regarding
[03:24:40] Ki and your willingness to obtain
[03:24:44] her kokomi
[03:24:51] is I don't even know what the [ __ ] to
[03:24:53] say do the fish
[03:24:59] emote okay how much you like chori I
[03:25:02] like chei
[03:25:04] somewhat uh I I the only thing I don't
[03:25:06] like I like her design and stuff the
[03:25:07] only thing I don't like about her is
[03:25:08] that she just feels like albo too like
[03:25:10] there's not much like I mean okay I like
[03:25:13] that I both like and dislike her e
[03:25:15] because I think it's really cool that
[03:25:17] you it like swaps you to another
[03:25:19] character that's like a new mechanic
[03:25:21] however I don't like that it forces you
[03:25:23] to go to the next character which means
[03:25:24] that if you act like if your party setup
[03:25:26] isn't perfectly crafted in the right
[03:25:28] order you're cooked also if you press e
[03:25:30] too many times you e on the character
[03:25:31] you swap into and it makes me want to
[03:25:33] cry but it is a unique thing and I think
[03:25:35] it's cool um and also her tomago doesn't
[03:25:38] get destroyed like albo's flower can
[03:25:40] although albo FL doesn't get destroy
[03:25:42] that much Jong Le's pillar does if
[03:25:43] you're playing Jang Le in a geot team uh
[03:25:45] get [ __ ] particles but Alo usually can
[03:25:47] position it fine I like
[03:25:50] chori um open world mechanics sure you
[03:25:53] can like e on The High Ground
[03:25:55] characterization I actually like her her
[03:25:57] her personality art and visual elements
[03:25:59] yep uh voice acting sure combat strength
[03:26:03] somewhat satisfied yep do you own chori
[03:26:06] yep
[03:26:10] um
[03:26:12] other she
[03:26:15] told the the guy at the store being
[03:26:19] weird
[03:26:24] to jump to walk into the ocean and take
[03:26:28] a deep breath and that made me respect
[03:26:32] her for who she
[03:26:37] is question mark wait didn't she do that
[03:26:39] she was like dude she like Flames some
[03:26:41] dude chori trailer
[03:26:47] uh hello is someone going to tailor my
[03:26:49] suit yeah this guy what were you
[03:26:52] thinking why would you keep a Keno
[03:26:54] commission official waiting she threw
[03:26:56] him out a window I mean that's basically
[03:26:57] the same she was last in line foolish
[03:27:01] girl you are no Apprentice of
[03:27:07] mine chori league player did you hear
[03:27:12] me hey it's first come first served this
[03:27:16] wedding dress needs to be ready for
[03:27:17] fitting by
[03:27:19] Nightfall aoff raise the waist a little
[03:27:22] higher to accentuate her figure and the
[03:27:25] sleeves need shortening I'll fetch the
[03:27:27] material got it I'll get it for
[03:27:32] you I knew it that dress is for Leticia
[03:27:35] isn't it always dreamed of wearing a
[03:27:38] choria wedding dress a so some poor
[03:27:42] girl's dumb dream is more important than
[03:27:44] my business huh she thinking it look
[03:27:47] we're we're all thinking it she just
[03:27:48] didn't say it yet but she's thinking it
[03:27:51] I'll say it for you [ __ ] it I'll take
[03:27:52] the B I was looking for my fabric shears
[03:27:56] those were the wrong ones this this was
[03:27:59] an expensive
[03:28:01] suit oops oh not those ones
[03:28:05] [Music]
[03:28:07] either what are you going to
[03:28:11] do what do you mean I thought you wanted
[03:28:14] your suit tailored
[03:28:20] look at her see that's what I'm saying
[03:28:23] that's what I saying and then she broke
[03:28:25] the glass
[03:28:27] chori who' you throw out this time what
[03:28:30] are you saying I did nothing so I
[03:28:34] respect her for
[03:28:37] that anyways uh do you have any other
[03:28:40] feedback regarding the character chori
[03:28:41] okay I will say
[03:28:46] hm I don't know I think the fact like
[03:28:49] the C1 stuff is a little I mean I guess
[03:28:51] it's all font 10 characters have like
[03:28:53] pretty [ __ ] insane C12 or like one of
[03:28:56] the two or
[03:28:57] both
[03:28:59] uh I'd say gameplay-wise a bit too
[03:29:02] similar to
[03:29:04] albo uh gameplay and performance- wise
[03:29:07] even though she can be slightly better
[03:29:09] but but still a solid character and
[03:29:13] good for geo Nation
[03:29:18] C1 like I want to say C1 should be base
[03:29:20] kid but
[03:29:22] like yeah I wish she could Double Summon
[03:29:29] with Navia without C1 but so is
[03:29:33] life next how much do you like k I love
[03:29:36] K uh how satisfied with fulla uh con
[03:29:40] ranked he's actually good and underrated
[03:29:42] okay for a free fourstar actually very
[03:29:44] satisfied for a free fourstar I think
[03:29:46] he's very underrated and a solid solid
[03:29:48] character open world mechanics cool it
[03:29:52] he's the og ice Bridger never forget uh
[03:29:55] not like amazing for like I feel like
[03:29:57] ice bridging half the time is annoying
[03:29:58] but I remember 1.0 low stamina for the
[03:30:01] geoh
[03:30:16] a terrorist and then what the [ __ ] he
[03:30:18] founded the abyss what the [ __ ] anyways
[03:30:19] he's cool uh voice acting uh I actually
[03:30:22] like Ka coolit balls art and visual
[03:30:25] elements I like him cool it Balls next
[03:30:27] is there any other feedback about the
[03:30:29] character that K Ka that you would like
[03:30:30] to
[03:30:32] share balls no it's going to get
[03:30:34] blacklisted if I type balls
[03:30:39] um I don't know the [ __ ] should I say
[03:30:42] about Ka did you know that
[03:30:47] Kaa Rosaria Shang Ling
[03:30:52] Bennett performs extremely well as one
[03:30:56] of the best free-to-play accessible
[03:31:00] fourstar teams that doesn't require sing
[03:31:04] Cho or any other Hydro for that matter
[03:31:08] allowing you to run them on your other
[03:31:12] half and decimating most Abyss
[03:31:17] rotations next kuo Sara I like Sara uh
[03:31:21] well okay I don't really like her kit
[03:31:23] but I like her design I think she's very
[03:31:25] cool uh but I kind of don't like her I I
[03:31:29] don't like the Saro is one of the firsts
[03:31:32] in the trend of Niche character for a
[03:31:34] specific
[03:31:36] element uh and there's like I think
[03:31:39] that's fine because it lets them avoid
[03:31:42] power creep and make new units that like
[03:31:44] fill a specific Niche which I think is
[03:31:46] fine however if a lot of their powers
[03:31:48] constellation locked which kind of is
[03:31:50] for Sara but it's not even close to far
[03:31:52] farzon so I hate farzon much more for
[03:31:54] that than Sara but obviously C2 C6
[03:31:57] notably C2 you know well yeah actually
[03:31:59] both can definitely matter but uh uh uh
[03:32:02] uh I also think that even in her like
[03:32:04] Niche like most of the time I'm making
[03:32:05] an electro team even if it's an electro
[03:32:07] team with an electro carry I'm picking
[03:32:09] fishell sorry sorry I said it sorry I
[03:32:11] said it or like like you can do it like
[03:32:13] Ryden but Ryden also doesn't need s like
[03:32:15] you can do right in Sara but you also
[03:32:16] don't need Sara which you know um is not
[03:32:20] a bad thing like you don't want to be
[03:32:22] dependent on a character but it's not
[03:32:23] like she does that much for that many
[03:32:27] characters but she's fine and then
[03:32:29] sometimes is good uh open world
[03:32:32] mechanics neutral I mean I don't really
[03:32:35] know honestly whatever characterization
[03:32:38] and
[03:32:42] storyline I didn't pay attention sorry
[03:32:44] Eno Zuma is is uh blocked out of my
[03:32:46] memory combat strength honestly don't
[03:32:49] hate me she's not like bad but uh yeah
[03:32:52] not amazing voice acting sure uh art and
[03:32:55] visual elements I really like next any
[03:32:57] other
[03:32:59] feedback one
[03:33:09] second ficial Von
[03:33:11] loss narid is a playable Electro
[03:33:14] character in genin Impact sorry overall
[03:33:17] how much you do the following factors
[03:33:18] influence your willingness to pull for
[03:33:20] characters rank them in order with one
[03:33:22] being important and seven being the
[03:33:24] least important like most important and
[03:33:25] seven being the least important the [ __ ]
[03:33:27] okay um art open world mechanics voice
[03:33:30] acting control party lineup
[03:33:33] characterization story line combat
[03:33:34] strength okay I'm going to say this as a
[03:33:36] non-u maker okay this is purely me as a
[03:33:43] player this this I'm not this isn't the
[03:33:46] right now these
[03:33:49] four these are the ones I like the I
[03:33:51] care about the most honestly it's mostly
[03:33:53] these three well this definitely matters
[03:33:56] too it's definitely these four control
[03:33:58] movement is kind of why I like Shia
[03:34:00] although I lik them before I played him
[03:34:01] cuz he looks cool but like I think he
[03:34:03] feels very like I like characters that
[03:34:05] are like agile like that feel like
[03:34:07] that's why I kind of like chorin cuz you
[03:34:08] can kind of control what you're doing
[03:34:09] with her like you can Dash you can
[03:34:10] choose the direction you dash in whereas
[03:34:12] like Yay Miko I like Yay but you play
[03:34:15] her and you're like like right here
[03:34:16] right now you get [ __ ] knocked into
[03:34:18] Antarctica and it's like okay well I'll
[03:34:20] just [ __ ] kill my okay but I think
[03:34:21] art IND visual elements definitely
[03:34:23] matters um it definitely matters to me I
[03:34:27] think how a character looks definitely
[03:34:29] matters
[03:34:32] um characterization also matters uh to a
[03:34:36] certain extent does it matter more than
[03:34:38] control/ movement and combat strength
[03:34:47] okay I'd say
[03:34:52] uh
[03:34:55] one
[03:34:59] two well not really maybe
[03:35:04] one like okay this is like true for some
[03:35:08] characters like finina even Nita but
[03:35:11] Nita is so broken like combat strength
[03:35:14] sometimes doesn't like if I like a
[03:35:15] character if I truly like a character I
[03:35:17] don't care if they're good or bad but
[03:35:18] some characters are so good that they're
[03:35:20] fun because they like trivialize content
[03:35:23] or make it easier like Kazu is not
[03:35:25] sometimes he's like a s grade or not
[03:35:28] even better than sucros but some
[03:35:29] sometimes he is but even when he doesn't
[03:35:32] feel like even when mathematically he's
[03:35:35] not better he just makes your life so
[03:35:37] much better that in practice he'll be
[03:35:38] better like it's just like it's like
[03:35:40] using a [ __ ] Fork instead of a spork
[03:35:43] what I don't know you get get what I'm
[03:35:45] saying though
[03:35:48] uh so it's probably ariv visual elements
[03:35:51] then control movement then combat
[03:35:53] strength then characterization then
[03:35:56] party lineup then open world no then I
[03:35:58] mean these are kind of whatever to me
[03:35:59] but open world's nice like I might get
[03:36:01] C1 yolan for that and the voice
[03:36:04] acting so basically he's better okay
[03:36:07] look I I'll be the first to tell you I
[03:36:08] think he's better I think he's amazing
[03:36:10] he's like my second highest ranked five
[03:36:13] star character I think he's insane
[03:36:15] however
[03:36:16] like a lot of the like some teams will
[03:36:18] perform similarly to another option or
[03:36:20] some teams you can't like you need an on
[03:36:22] Fielder and you can't use them for that
[03:36:23] and that's
[03:36:24] fine but like his grouping and then the
[03:36:27] convenience of it and how low the
[03:36:29] cooldown is it's just like it makes it
[03:36:31] to where I don't know your life is just
[03:36:33] a lot easier like it's easier to play
[03:36:35] sometimes it'll just translate to being
[03:36:36] better because of the ease of grouping
[03:36:38] and like I don't know it's yeah oh
[03:36:41] that's it what the heck
[03:36:48] okay
[03:36:52] money can I do it again
[03:36:57] [ __ ] wait should I do it on my freeto

[03:42:46] oh thank God this is actually the
[03:42:47] perfect
[03:42:51] outcome
[03:43:01] also actually not Also let's lock in how
[03:43:03] much do you like
[03:43:04] baiju I somewhat like the character
[03:43:08] actually yeah I'll leave it at somewhat
[03:43:10] how satisfied are you with the aspects
[03:43:12] of character baiju okay open world
[03:43:14] mechanics
[03:43:15] I think he's cool cuz he heals you a lot
[03:43:17] so I like using him for the open world
[03:43:19] art and visual elements I like his snake
[03:43:21] also I Revisited this trailer not too
[03:43:23] long ago off stream uh but in baiju's
[03:43:27] trailer he looks extra
[03:43:30] like yeah like look usually he looks
[03:43:33] like okay whatever but
[03:43:35] like wait where was
[03:43:39] it like what the [ __ ] BYU doesn't look
[03:43:41] like this
[03:43:42] normally wait where is it um
[03:43:46] oh not at all I have complete confidence
[03:43:48] in your pers what the hell since when
[03:43:51] does BYU look like
[03:43:53] that so anyways art visual elements I
[03:43:57] think is pretty cool characterization
[03:43:58] and
[03:43:59] storyline okay I need a lad to like tell
[03:44:02] me cuz I don't actually know is his like
[03:44:06] business relationship with Chi-Chi
[03:44:08] ethical or is it like is it like is it
[03:44:11] like child labor like is it like is
[03:44:12] Chi-Chi like you know is he like helping
[03:44:14] her out or is he like like cooking her
[03:44:17] he's like her dad he's helping her okay
[03:44:19] okay okay then cool characterization
[03:44:22] okay voice acting sure combat strength
[03:44:27] honestly someone satisfied I think in a
[03:44:30] lot of a lot of times he can be a yao
[03:44:31] yao side grade which is not a bad like
[03:44:34] it's cool cuz you don't need to get him
[03:44:36] but he's particularly nice with finina
[03:44:38] and he's also very comfy so I actually
[03:44:39] do like him quite a
[03:44:41] lot because it's a character that's very
[03:44:43] optional but it gives gives you a lot of
[03:44:45] like pluses if you get him and I feel
[03:44:48] like he's very popular with
[03:44:49] finina
[03:44:52] um I also like that his shield is
[03:44:55] garbage because I think having like he's
[03:44:58] mostly a Healer but having like the
[03:45:00] extra resistance Interruption is cool
[03:45:02] but like I don't having a turbo strong
[03:45:05] Shield is is would be broken with this
[03:45:08] kit like I don't know do you own BYU yes
[03:45:11] what's your primary motivation for
[03:45:12] owning
[03:45:13] BYU uh strong
[03:45:16] party finina and uh interesting do you
[03:45:19] have any feedback regarding
[03:45:21] BYU
[03:45:23] um I
[03:45:25] think Buu
[03:45:28] is
[03:45:30] a character I don't know um
[03:45:34] very cool side grade to yao yao
[03:45:40] sometimes upgrade other times good with
[03:45:44] finina
[03:45:46] his shield sucks [ __ ] but let me censor
[03:45:49] this
[03:45:50] sucks [ __ ] moram meat but he
[03:45:55] is a good
[03:45:58] healer and never seen a single personis
[03:46:00] use yaa over BYU bro ya Yao goes [ __ ]
[03:46:04] crazy also a fourstar also the thing is
[03:46:06] is like you haven't seen that because if
[03:46:09] you pulled BYU you're going to use BYU
[03:46:10] but yaa is a fourstar very good
[03:46:13] sometimes does the exact same thing in
[03:46:14] know like in some teams or does like you
[03:46:16] know like ya ya in like a Neo team
[03:46:17] she'll be different um and it's like the
[03:46:21] point is that because Yao exists you
[03:46:23] don't need BYU but BYU can be better
[03:46:25] sometimes like with finina so yeah
[03:46:28] anyways how much do you like nevet okay
[03:46:31] I love nevet I'll say this right now I
[03:46:34] love nevet I love nevet I think he's
[03:46:37] elegant I think he's graceful he's a
[03:46:39] [ __ ] Hydro Dragon he has a [ __ ]
[03:46:41] giant ass Hydro
[03:46:43] beam however
[03:46:46] he's like too strong to where I kind of
[03:46:48] want to say go [ __ ] yourself it's like a
[03:46:50] weird
[03:46:52] like
[03:46:54] dude like I actually think he's a
[03:46:56] mistake okay no no but
[03:46:59] like I don't know it feels like
[03:47:03] especially like the current Abyss you
[03:47:04] need so much Hydro if you have nevette
[03:47:07] easy mode if you don't have nevette
[03:47:09] you're like the [ __ ] meme where
[03:47:10] you're like sweating and like like let
[03:47:12] me pull it up gamer sweat
[03:47:15] versus payone
[03:47:20] meme okay like I I don't know the
[03:47:22] original but like someone edit this with
[03:47:24] like nevet versus like a freeto playay
[03:47:27] team like this is no nevet in the abyss
[03:47:31] and then this is net
[03:47:45] yeah so that's how I
[03:47:47] feel
[03:47:48] um It's cool cuz
[03:47:52] like you
[03:47:54] know I actually don't know what I'm
[03:47:56] trying to say like it's not bad for
[03:47:58] there to be a DPS that's really strong
[03:48:01] cuz then like let's say you're free to
[03:48:02] play you pull for a really strong
[03:48:03] character then you don't need like every
[03:48:05] [ __ ] five star in the game you can
[03:48:06] clear the like it you know there's like
[03:48:08] reasons why a good character is good but
[03:48:10] also like I think he's a bit overtuned
[03:48:13] and a bit I'm using the word a bit so
[03:48:15] generously that it should be like I
[03:48:17] should be able to use it as a donation
[03:48:18] on my taxes as a [ __ ] write off but
[03:48:21] like you know he's definitely
[03:48:23] overtuned um which I dislike but I do
[03:48:28] think he's
[03:48:29] fun um although I did get bored of him
[03:48:31] faster than I
[03:48:33] thought but
[03:48:36] yeah he's also probably the first I
[03:48:39] think genin does a okay they do a lot of
[03:48:41] things poorly but one thing they do well
[03:48:43] in my opinion is they don't power creep
[03:48:45] much like there's some and I think the
[03:48:47] first like arguable instance is nevet
[03:48:49] like I think nevet is just a better AO
[03:48:51] like AO has off field presence that's
[03:48:55] it um yeah open world mechanics yep
[03:48:59] voice acting shirt uh characterization
[03:49:01] storyline yeah I really like him art I
[03:49:04] really like
[03:49:06] him but yeah I do think he's a bit
[03:49:12] overtuned do you own NE let yes what's
[03:49:16] your primary motivation uh I like them
[03:49:18] feels good strong abilities any feedback
[03:49:22] please please please please please
[03:49:28] please please do not release another
[03:49:32] character another sorry you can release
[03:49:34] a strong support but another DPS of his
[03:49:38] caliber it makes it invalidates
[03:49:45] other
[03:49:47] characters
[03:49:49] and
[03:49:50] transcends
[03:49:53] Beyond the play
[03:49:57] whichever of the many strong
[03:50:01] DPS
[03:50:03] exist and instead leans towards pull net
[03:50:08] you [ __ ] dumbass or suffer
[03:50:21] all
[03:50:23] right he's really cool though and a
[03:50:27] dragon raw
[03:50:30] XD how much you like Navia okay I
[03:50:32] actually like Navia uh
[03:50:35] how storyline cool I mean her friends
[03:50:37] are dead sorry uh I mean like yeah it's
[03:50:40] fine combat strength very satisfied open
[03:50:41] world mechanics yeah yeah you can use
[03:50:43] your e you don't need like alt for for
[03:50:44] just killing a random thing so it's cool
[03:50:46] voice acting Sure Fire sure sure art and
[03:50:48] visual elements
[03:50:52] um I'm just gonna okay look uh I like
[03:50:55] her
[03:50:57] she gives me I mean I think she's pretty
[03:51:00] all right yeah she's cool whatever like
[03:51:02] it's a bit too
[03:51:05] like I don't know already old what's
[03:51:07] your Navia what she's so pretty I I
[03:51:11] literally clicked satisfied what are you
[03:51:13] talking about what are you talking I
[03:51:14] clicked satisfied I literally clicked
[03:51:19] satisfied the only drawback to me is
[03:51:21] like I can't see her without seeing
[03:51:23] Taylor Swift but every like it's the
[03:51:25] same thing with child and Ed Sheeran
[03:51:27] it's not necessarily a bad thing it's
[03:51:29] just like because that connection's in
[03:51:30] my brain I can't unsee it but I do think
[03:51:32] she's great and beautiful okay okay this
[03:51:35] character has interesting skill
[03:51:36] mechanics yep um yep
[03:51:46] Society if her burst summoned Malo and
[03:51:51] silver can I put
[03:51:54] Emojis no I can't oh wait I can what the
[03:52:01] [ __ ] anyways
[03:52:04] um I think Navia is
[03:52:10] actually rewarding to play and a good
[03:52:15] good
[03:52:17] character despite being Geo very strong
[03:52:22] solid DPS good freeo playay teams but
[03:52:25] not power creeping and invalidating
[03:52:30] content like a certain Hydro
[03:52:35] Sovereign I don't actually know if he's
[03:52:37] Dragon okay next how much you like Razer
[03:52:42] okay
[03:52:43] unironically I mean I created My Free
[03:52:45] Play account to play Razer but then like
[03:52:46] he used to be like fine in Abyss like
[03:52:48] 1112 and then new abys new abys newys
[03:52:50] newys newys now you play him you get
[03:52:52] [ __ ] but you can play thundering
[03:52:54] furry if you have C6 Bennett uh I don't
[03:52:57] play that though but like you can I mean
[03:52:59] I think he's cool uh I wish he was you
[03:53:01] know not physical but I mean I guess
[03:53:04] he's not in that team I do like the
[03:53:07] character though I actually do like him
[03:53:08] quite a bit he was one of the first like
[03:53:10] one of the first few characters I was
[03:53:11] like yeah this guy's
[03:53:12] cool um so like them combat
[03:53:17] strength okay uh well art and visual
[03:53:21] elements yeah voice acting uh honestly I
[03:53:26] [ __ ] love Japanese Razer I think he's
[03:53:28] [ __ ] sick open world mechanics sure
[03:53:32] characterization I mean he's a little
[03:53:33] bit like I do like that he's like razor
[03:53:36] language and he just like condenses
[03:53:38] stuff
[03:53:38] down um so that's
[03:53:43] cool probably smells terrible though but
[03:53:45] I mean it's not really his fault he's
[03:53:47] Raised by Wolves but you know it's okay
[03:53:48] I mean I kind of want to take him down a
[03:53:50] point for that but it's fine um we'll do
[03:53:52] that all right
[03:53:55] um
[03:54:00] razor I'm just going to write
[03:54:06] razor overall how much do you like
[03:54:10] farizan I'm glad you asked me
[03:54:15] [Music]
[03:54:20] thank you thank you gen impact for
[03:54:22] asking me my thoughts on Faron I've been
[03:54:25] waiting for this day I've been waiting
[03:54:26] for someone to listen fact I've been
[03:54:27] telling this to myself over and over how
[03:54:30] much I like farizon and no one's been
[03:54:31] listening I'm glad someone
[03:54:37] cares I somewhat dislike the character
[03:54:39] now let me explain why Z you're a Shain
[03:54:41] man you you play an emo characters why
[03:54:43] do you somewhat like her well let's see
[03:54:47] combat
[03:54:49] strength somewhat satisfied art inv
[03:54:52] visual
[03:54:54] actually at C6 very satisfied at
[03:55:01] c0 we'll do some with that one art and
[03:55:03] visual
[03:55:04] elements yeah she's all right open world
[03:55:08] mechanics characterization
[03:55:12] storyline voice acting have fun with
[03:55:15] this game Miku hater oh sorry sorry okay
[03:55:19] next is there any other feedback about
[03:55:21] the character that you would like to
[03:55:22] share yes as a matter of fact there is
[03:55:28] farizon is a very cool looking character
[03:55:36] wow hot
[03:55:38] sunny
[03:55:40] Miku I love her
[03:55:46] however there are some glaring flaws in
[03:55:50] her game play design let me
[03:55:55] explain first of
[03:55:58] all anemo is my
[03:56:02] favorite element
[03:56:06] wow she's great however there's some
[03:56:10] gunning flaws in her gameplay design let
[03:56:11] me explain one
[03:56:16] for what
[03:56:18] reason
[03:56:20] should several
[03:56:23] parts of a character's otherwise
[03:56:27] interesting kit be locked behind a
[03:56:32] singular
[03:56:34] constellation C1 okay C2 okay C3 okay C4
[03:56:42] okay C5 okay
[03:56:48] C6
[03:56:51] colossal unlike anything we've
[03:56:55] ever seen before from a
[03:56:59] fourstar it's like if sar's C2 plus C6
[03:57:04] plus C8 plus a new
[03:57:07] character were all locked behind a
[03:57:12] singular constellation
[03:57:15] you may be
[03:57:17] thinking Z oh [ __ ] I doxed myself uh
[03:57:20] Nick [ __ ] uh kokomi
[03:57:23] fan wait what's my name on my Asia
[03:57:25] server whatever
[03:57:27] [Applause]
[03:57:28] traveler one second and let me fact
[03:57:30] check something really fast
[03:57:47] faron's C6
[03:57:50] doesn't do that
[03:57:52] much right doesn't it just do
[03:57:59] like characters affected by the wind
[03:58:01] secret ways pray full winds benefit have
[03:58:03] 40% increased crit damage when they deal
[03:58:05] anemo damage when the characters uh
[03:58:06] active character deals damage when
[03:58:08] affected by prayerful winds benefit they
[03:58:10] will apply pressurized collapse to the
[03:58:12] opponent's damage the effect can be
[03:58:13] triggered once every 3 seconds this cool
[03:58:14] down to shared between all party
[03:58:17] members yes but it's much more than
[03:58:21] meets the eye
[03:58:24] firstly you gain an Nemo crit damage
[03:58:29] which is
[03:58:30] [Music]
[03:58:31] nice
[03:58:33] secondly you
[03:58:35] also gain a significant amount of energy
[03:58:41] generation for not only
[03:58:44] your otherwise 300 ER
[03:58:48] need but
[03:58:50] [ __ ] I'm trying to find a nice way to
[03:58:53] say
[03:58:56] like
[03:58:59] needing oxygen wasting okay sorry
[03:59:02] needing support but also for your other
[03:59:08] anemo
[03:59:09] characters that you are supporting
[03:59:19] thirdly you also gain skill damage which
[03:59:24] not only deals damage but especially
[03:59:29] allows you to run a supportive set like
[03:59:34] tenacity of the
[03:59:37] milleth if fourthly if that wasn't all
[03:59:46] sufficient
[03:59:48] faron's C6 also provides you with some
[03:59:53] grouping
[03:59:55] greatly aiding the
[03:59:58] anemo DPS she is paired with now while
[04:00:04] her anemo Buffs are very much
[04:00:08] appreciated for a sh main like me the
[04:00:13] sheer fact that it is locked behind a C6
[04:00:18] on a fourstar which is never guaranteed
[04:00:24] never is truly
[04:00:27] Blasphemous and
[04:00:30] outrageous it is simply
[04:00:36] put like trying to brush your teeth
[04:00:41] without a toothbrush
[04:00:45] c0 farizon is like toothpaste on a
[04:00:49] finger C2 to four is like
[04:00:54] toothpaste with a
[04:00:56] toothpick and C6
[04:00:59] farizon is like a
[04:01:03] perfect toothbrush a perfect and new
[04:01:07] toothbrush with fresh
[04:01:11] toothpaste this these these are my qums
[04:01:15] I think that's a word with fars
[04:01:19] on wait it's not a
[04:01:23] word
[04:01:28] quals I love
[04:01:31] her I truly do as an Animo player I am
[04:01:37] very grateful for her better than
[04:01:41] nothing at c0 and nice still for Shia e
[04:01:46] but a colossal
[04:01:49] difference at C6 which is in my opinion
[04:01:54] the poorest designed
[04:01:57] constellation layout and kit in all of
[04:02:05] tat I would
[04:02:09] rather die
[04:02:14] then build 400 ER on my
[04:02:18] Faron
[04:02:20] love
[04:02:26] Z okay it's like not 400
[04:02:31] but do you think they're going to ignore
[04:02:33] it
[04:02:46] I want to move my C
[04:02:55] back all
[04:02:57] right overall how much is the folling
[04:02:59] factors influence your willingness to
[04:03:00] pull for
[04:03:02] characters

[04:07:30] [ __ ] how many Primos do I have on this
[04:07:32] account damn dude I should have pulled
[04:07:34] for finina but like I don't think I want
[04:07:36] to pull until I like clear the abyss
[04:07:39] maybe unless it's a really cool
[04:07:40] character and like I want to do like
[04:07:42] whatever this account has has and then
[04:07:45] well I'm not going to pull anyways but
[04:07:47] like I'll I'll like yeah and then and
[04:07:48] then we'll decide what we do with it cuz
[04:07:51] right now the account is kind of like
[04:07:53] it's not like amazing but I feel like
[04:07:54] that makes it a challenge but if I had
[04:07:56] like every good character it would be
