[00:10:29] star characters but before that welcome
[00:10:31] to the stream how is your [ __ ] I'm
[00:10:34] convinced he isn't
[00:10:36] the because he either got spoiled or he
[00:10:40] is terrified I only I barely got spoiled
[00:10:43] I only know a little bit of the Aron
[00:10:44] Quest I only saw like small parts that I
[00:10:46] shouldn't have seen But for most of it
[00:10:47] I'm I'm still blind uh the only thing I
[00:10:49] got spoiled is jjk and Chainsaw man cuz
[00:10:51] the people that read that [ __ ] comic
[00:10:53] book are dumb losers that don't know how
[00:10:54] to shut the [ __ ] up or talk to their
[00:10:56] friends about it or put tags to about
[00:10:58] spoilers cuz they're all [ __ ] mouth
[00:11:00] breathing losers that don't know how to
[00:11:02] [ __ ] properly tag something oh oh I
[00:11:04] read comic book in my book club oh
[00:11:07] here's what here's how your favorite
[00:11:08] character dies no one asked you you have
[00:11:11] no friends have no family no [ __ ] no
[00:11:15] no
[00:11:16] nothing neither do
[00:11:19] I anyways sorry welcome to the
[00:11:23] stream I don't really care like I'm at
[00:11:25] the point where I don't care anymore I
[00:11:26] just I appreciate the animation now I
[00:11:28] already know everyone that
[00:11:29] and I'm I'm like season one I know who's
[00:11:32] dying is what it is is what it
[00:11:35] is is is what it
[00:11:40] is night Dad sorry for yelling I didn't
[00:11:45] mean
[00:11:47] it
[00:11:49] well
[00:11:51] anyways
[00:11:52] [Laughter]
[00:11:55] uh what is playing right now wait what
[00:11:57] music is playing oh
[00:12:00] wait whose theme is
[00:12:02] this m stream when how do I not know who
[00:12:05] Serene and
[00:12:07] fatherless Ayo that's the chat I guess
[00:12:10] it is AO huh benched okay this might be
[00:12:14] a bad take but Ayo is one of the only
[00:12:17] five stars that almost objectively got
[00:12:19] powercraft like I know he has more off
[00:12:21] field presence he's like a bit you know
[00:12:23] Norm like it's like different but like
[00:12:25] he's the only character where it's
[00:12:27] literally like why don't I just play
[00:12:29] nlet like every other five star child
[00:12:32] has strangling kakomi heals yolon off
[00:12:34] field like he's like the only [ __ ]
[00:12:37] character where it's just
[00:12:39] nevet and it
[00:12:41] hurts it hurts because I have the right
[00:12:45] one
[00:12:48] I whatever it's okay I'm actually sad
[00:12:52] about that like I love nevet but [ __ ]
[00:12:55] [ __ ] you man why are you this good why
[00:12:57] is nevet that good we have to talk about
[00:12:59] this I'm actually going to talk about I
[00:13:01] wanted to make a video about the the
[00:13:02] like five best okay we'll talk about
[00:13:05] this later in the Stream but I want to
[00:13:06] talk about some five star characters
[00:13:07] with everyone and net actually doesn't
[00:13:09] make sense but we'll get into
[00:13:15] that- 16 is better to farm Mar or emblem
[00:13:19] have terrible artifacts across the board
[00:13:20] you can't go wrong with either but since
[00:13:22] emblems now in the strong box the
[00:13:23] correct answer is probably Mar and
[00:13:26] golden and then use strong box your
[00:13:27] emblem but you might not have Fina and
[00:13:29] without finina the amount of characters
[00:13:30] you have that need those two sets are
[00:13:32] lower but you probably still have like
[00:13:34] Fel or nevet or rizzly or Linny or like
[00:13:37] a bunch of characters so
[00:13:39] depends anyways or ver million okay
[00:13:42] welcome to the stream we have a lot to
[00:13:43] talk about I'm not going to stall I'm
[00:13:44] not going to stall I'm not going to
[00:13:45] stall I I Rush okay I I didn't even
[00:13:48] shave I look like a like a rat aritar 11
[00:13:51] months Farm deepwood true's also really
[00:13:54] good but that wasn't in the multiple
[00:13:56] choice so you failed the exam you just
[00:13:58] made up your own [ __ ] multiple
[00:14:04] choice anyways welcome to the stream
[00:14:06] chat uh update on the archon quest it
[00:14:09] will be done I said I'm going to do it
[00:14:11] this week and I'm not a liar so I'm
[00:14:13] going to be doing it this week except
[00:14:15] instead of this week it's next week
[00:14:16] listen I was going to do it before I
[00:14:18] left for 4 days but the reason I didn't
[00:14:20] was because listen my Dad's here and I
[00:14:23] don't want him to see me in the Jean
[00:14:25] outfit wearing Jean's wig and Jean's
[00:14:27] like half naked outfit so I'm going to
[00:14:29] wait till he's not here which is next
[00:14:30] week listen it's an 8 Hour stream okay I
[00:14:33] can't what the [ __ ] you want me to do

[00:14:57] little bit after the B release I
[00:14:59] literally was pre- farming for like
[00:15:00] weeks except you want to know something
[00:15:02] funny okay listen I'm going to say this
[00:15:04] early in the Stream cuz the star rail

[00:15:18] was catching up off stream today and I
[00:15:19] unlocked the newest boss I was like oh
[00:15:21] [ __ ] so I had to farm that all day I
[00:15:23] spent like like 10 fragile resin on it
[00:15:25] is what it is like fuels it's fine so we
[00:15:27] were like pre- fared but is what it is
[00:15:29] uh so we'll have Argentina and Hana when

[00:29:26] right get Di
[00:29:29] W okay chat just kidding we're still
[00:29:31] stalling okay before we start a few
[00:29:34] things you pay CH Giga
[00:29:38] Chad so I purposefully saw this Dev blog
[00:29:43] and didn't click on it well that I kind
[00:29:45] of lied I clicked on it I said I'm going
[00:29:48] to save this for stream but what if I
[00:29:49] scrolled once I saw one click
[00:29:52] Expeditions I tweeted about it and then
[00:29:53] I started Stream So I still haven't read
[00:29:56] the whole blog and I'm like 99% sure
[00:30:00] we're not getting artifact loadouts but
[00:30:02] it's called artifact management and
[00:30:04] enhancement screen optimizations so hey
[00:30:07] maybe probably not but I would love to
[00:30:10] believe so especially
[00:30:12] because look listen
[00:30:15] listen listen I I only I haven't
[00:30:19] scrolled all the way well I scrolled
[00:30:20] like I haven't read it yet
[00:30:23] so let's read this new blog that is
[00:30:27] coming you are coping so unbelievably
[00:30:30] hard well we're about to get so
[00:30:32] unbelievably hard if presets are coming
[00:30:34] maybe not this version maybe not next
[00:30:38] version but as long as it's coming then
[00:30:40] so are we hello Travelers in version 4.3
[00:30:43] will Implement optimizations in the game
[00:30:46] archon quest requium of the depths to
[00:30:49] ensure that Trav have a smoother
[00:30:50] experience from version 3 the chasm
[00:30:52] delve is no longer prerequisite okay
[00:30:54] cool doesn't matter oneclick features
[00:30:56] first of all the one of the biggest
[00:30:58] changes we've been asking for since
[00:31:00] since back before [ __ ] technology was
[00:31:03] invented oneclick Expeditions the
[00:31:06] ability to say hey man why the [ __ ] does
[00:31:08] your other game have it but we don't why
[00:31:10] the [ __ ] every time I send my Bennett
[00:31:12] and chii to the mines I have to take
[00:31:14] them out and then put them back in now
[00:31:17] oneclick Expeditions will become
[00:31:18] available after 4.3 this will allow
[00:31:21] travelers to claim Expedition rewards
[00:31:22] with a single click as well as repeat
[00:31:25] Expeditions with a single
[00:31:30] click this is a w this is the biggest W
[00:31:34] ever
[00:31:35] now if I were anyone else I would be
[00:31:38] like hey why didn't this happen 3 years
[00:31:40] ago but I'm not someone else so I'm
[00:31:42] happy finally [ __ ]
[00:31:45] finally I genuinely thought that they
[00:31:48] purposefully didn't want to add this so
[00:31:50] that we go play Star rail but I'm glad
[00:31:52] they [ __ ] added it now let's keep
[00:31:54] going ingredient processing and forging
[00:31:55] the rest I haven't seen uh processing
[00:31:58] and forging aside from Expeditions
[00:31:59] you'll be able to claim processed
[00:32:00] ingredients and Forge them with a single
[00:32:02] click okay that's cool Mystic
[00:32:05] offer when performing Mystic offering at
[00:32:07] crafting benches you'll now be able to
[00:32:09] add multiple artifacts and batches with
[00:32:10] a single click in future versions you'll
[00:32:12] also able to claim created
[00:32:18] Furnishing I mean this looks cool but
[00:32:22] I've also okay there's a bunch of
[00:32:23] [ __ ] let me explain this uh let me
[00:32:25] cuz I know a lot of you guys are visual
[00:32:26] learners let me show you why this isn't
[00:32:28] as big as you might think the Expedition
[00:32:29] part is really cool but let me uh first
[00:32:31] of all do something really fast so if
[00:32:33] you notice when I uh do a strong box for
[00:32:36] example right I'll strong box something
[00:32:38] smart like emblem or Vermilion right
[00:32:40] there's a reason why I click on each
[00:32:41] artifact every time I do this a bunch of
[00:32:43] [ __ ] idiots sorry people in the chat
[00:32:46] say oh oh you know you can drag click he
[00:32:48] can drag click you can but the problem
[00:32:50] is if you drag click what if there's a
[00:32:52] good artifact I didn't lock what if I
[00:32:53] just drag click something that had
[00:32:55] potential what if in what I like crit
[00:32:56] rate this this could get crit damage
[00:32:57] this could be good maybe I didn't want
[00:32:58] to throw that okay maybe I didn't want
[00:33:00] to throw that okay so there's like
[00:33:03] that's why I think that even though
[00:33:04] we're getting batch changes me
[00:33:06] personally I don't want to just batch I
[00:33:08] want to click on them to see okay
[00:33:09] nothing good here okay Mystic offering
[00:33:12] you know and then that turns into a
[00:33:13] piece okay healing bonus okay I just
[00:33:15] have to see maybe anyways so yeah next
[00:33:18] up
[00:33:20] optimiz chat if this is artifact
[00:33:25] presets I will suck every dick why did I
[00:33:30] say that if this is artifact presets 100
[00:33:32] gifted 100 gifted to my stream and every
[00:33:35] stream on Twitch now the reason why I'm
[00:33:37] confident saying that is because I know
[00:33:39] they're not adding it okay I know they
[00:33:40] won't add it I just know there's no way
[00:33:42] they add it there's literally no way
[00:33:44] they add it I'll do I'll there is no way
[00:33:47] they add it but if they
[00:33:54] do wait what is this
[00:33:58] okay the song is distracting
[00:34:01] me okay as the journey goes on the
[00:34:04] number of artifacts test you can collect
[00:34:05] will continue to increase to help
[00:34:07] Travelers quickly find and manage
[00:34:08] artifacts please please please automatic
[00:34:12] locking and quick unlock factions have
[00:34:14] been added okay to automatically lock
[00:34:17] and unlock carment that's cool if you
[00:34:19] get crit damage crit rate you can auto
[00:34:20] lock sure but I don't really care okay
[00:34:24] okay
[00:34:25] additionally as a reference to help
[00:34:27] Travelers when
[00:34:30] choosing recommended artifact set
[00:34:33] information based on recently active
[00:34:35] players will be shown on characters
[00:34:36] artifact screens for more details about
[00:34:39] artifact management options please stay
[00:34:40] tuned in the future official
[00:34:45] descriptions okay well we're getting a
[00:34:47] recommended Stat or set not stat we're
[00:34:50] getting recommended artifact sets based
[00:34:52] on active players now for those of you
[00:34:55] typing oh huge
[00:34:58] jobless era let me remind you how
[00:35:00] completely uh uh uh brain dead the
[00:35:03] average genin player is not you guys not
[00:35:06] you watching this You're great and
[00:35:07] honestly it's okay to be a casual who
[00:35:09] cares but I'm just saying for Shia for
[00:35:11] example his normal attack levels are
[00:35:14] about 15 to six million times more
[00:35:16] important than his burst levels it's
[00:35:17] true it's a lot more damage what do you
[00:35:20] think Talent reference will tell a new
[00:35:21] player to level
[00:35:25] first what so it's going to be the same
[00:35:28] with the artifact part uh probably so
[00:35:30] it's probably not going to be very
[00:35:31] helpful but you know better than nothing
[00:35:33] sure anyway actually I think it'll do
[00:35:35] more harm than good but we'll see
[00:35:37] depends on the character I guess star
[00:35:38] rail is yet to get the artifact load out
[00:35:40] feature yet going to have to wait
[00:35:43] another few years for them to get it
[00:35:45] shut up like a man can dream optimized
[00:35:47] enhancement screens okay okay when
[00:35:50] Travelers a pop-up appears okay uh this
[00:35:53] will make okay wait in version 4.3
[00:35:55] enhancement information will be
[00:35:56] integrated into the original screen
[00:35:58] making it smoother for travel getting
[00:36:00] rid of the frequent popups I like that I
[00:36:06] like okay I like
[00:36:08] that
[00:36:11] sure quality of life that we expect from

[00:45:35] this Mel I forgot to crop this picture
[00:45:36] but this melin costume was designed for
[00:45:39] very
[00:45:40] skinny um
[00:45:43] cosplayers and not a big Mammoth of a
[00:45:46] man like me it was designed it was worn
[00:45:48] by like 5 foot2 like like like literally

[00:45:54] cosplayers not me okay I come in it I
[00:45:56] literally I I tried to put it on it
[00:45:58] didn't fit I had to wear it [ __ ]
[00:46:00] backwards like it wouldn't it literally
[00:46:03] putting the mask on crushed my nose and
[00:46:05] I couldn't see so I had to flip it like
[00:46:08] I was supposed to wear it the other way
[00:46:09] so I could have a like they were going
[00:46:10] to put a tail I was like dude no so I
[00:46:13] literally flipped it like it wasn't
[00:46:14] closed but I put this [ __ ] paper
[00:46:16] thing over so that it hides It Anyways
[00:46:18] also the arms because it was warn by
[00:46:20] like five other costumes before me were
[00:46:22] I swear to God not their fault by the
[00:46:24] way but were like kind of soaking wet it
[00:46:27] is what it is but I almost cut my arm
[00:46:29] off it's fine but I just like didn't put
[00:46:31] my arm all the way so I kept it like I
[00:46:33] only put like the like like the T like
[00:46:35] like like like half of it in so it was
[00:46:38] fine um I know it was kind of gross but
[00:46:40] the outfit itself was cool
[00:46:42] uh I disinfected my hands it's fine but
[00:46:46] anyways outside of that I was fine I was
[00:46:48] a meloine um I just couldn't really see
[00:46:51] and I couldn't tap my phone so it's a
[00:46:52] very scuffed Temple session now the
[00:46:56] banners for the temple were not very
[00:46:57] hype because it's [ __ ] Ayo and Soo oh
[00:47:00] also I think I'm going to play my freeo
[00:47:02] playay account cuz I want to pull just
[00:47:03] build pity I know H build pity but I
[00:47:06] need kie and Kirara so if I get either
[00:47:08] I'm happy hopefully we can get kie but
[00:47:09] if I get Ayo or Soo I'm offing I'm gonna
[00:47:12] I'm going to Jet dash off a bridge but
[00:47:14] it's fine we're not going to get it so
[00:47:16] uh I was doing temples and just so you
[00:47:19] guys know not to spoil the short but I
[00:47:21] did a temple and I got Mona I was like
[00:47:24] Hey can a meline win the 5050 I got Mona
[00:47:27] and then I like threw my phone well I
[00:47:28] didn't throw it but like it like fell
[00:47:30] like I didn't like slam it but like it
[00:47:31] fell and when it fell it closed cuz I
[00:47:35] couldn't use my [ __ ] Paws okay okay
[00:47:37] that sounds furry I couldn't use my
[00:47:38] hands it it fell it closed it ended the
[00:47:40] recording but there's still someone
[00:47:42] while Fang was recording like the video
[00:47:43] okay
[00:47:45] sure but the the screen recording
[00:47:47] stopped after Mona and then I tried so I
[00:47:49] picked it up and like what if we get
[00:47:50] another five star I tried to swipe down
[00:47:53] okay I tried to swipe down picture
[00:47:54] animate this I tried to swipe down down
[00:47:56] when I pressed to swipe down I swear I
[00:47:59] swear to God I got cookie then I was

[00:48:03] just in case I swiped again I got
[00:48:06] [ __ ] aoto I got two five stars and I
[00:48:10] didn't record the second one so I only
[00:48:12] started recording again after Mona and
[00:48:14] before the next weapon so like recording
[00:48:16] I got Mona then it stopped and it
[00:48:18] restarted after the AO and then like I
[00:48:20] was trying to swipe up but it kept
[00:48:22] tapping whatever so that's going to be a

[00:58:13] be a good
[00:58:14] video if I'm out of content I'll watch
[00:58:23] it
[00:58:28] he hates hyper Bloom okay I don't like
[00:58:31] when people paraphrase another person
[00:58:33] listen now you guys are paraphrasing
[00:58:34] another Creator cuz now if I all I hear
[00:58:37] is they hate hyper cuz now I'm taking
[00:58:39] your word and if the word is they hate
[00:58:41] hyper blo then why would you hate a
[00:58:43] super freetop playay friendly easy team
[00:58:45] that invalidates a lot of the single
[00:58:46] Target carries you would otherwise pull
[00:58:48] for that's just great and that costs
[00:58:50] like nothing to build other than em but
[00:58:52] see that's probably not what they said
[00:58:53] and now I'm going to have to watch it to
[00:58:54] argue about it so I don't want to so
[00:58:56] [ __ ] all of
[00:59:06] you what the [ __ ] net
[00:59:11] hello they said you hate hyper blo me I
[00:59:15] don't hate hyper blo when the [ __ ] did I
[00:59:17] say I hate hyper blo I hate that it
[00:59:19] exists actually that's not true I I just
[00:59:22] think it like makes Hut worse cuz why
[00:59:24] would you pull for a single Target carry
[00:59:26] when you can hyper Bloom but who car
[00:59:27] like it's
[00:59:29] broken donated $1 hello Mr sock I watch
[00:59:33] you in Costco Anda in
[00:59:36] Costco what does that mean you're
[00:59:39] watching me at the
[00:59:41] store hyper Lum is
[00:59:48] cringe am I getting one guide I'm
[00:59:51] getting one guide okay fine I'm going to
[00:59:53] get one guide f fine I'll get one
[00:59:58] guide what was this what did you link
[01:00:01] me this has 56 dislikes
[01:00:07] [Applause]
[01:00:14] why okay fine I will give credit to this
[01:00:17] person so that I'm not stealing their
[01:00:19] content okay I don't like reacting if
[01:00:21] I'm stealing the content so I will you
[01:00:23] know if it's a video I will link
[01:00:26] it um with that said if it's a good
[01:00:29] video check it out if it's a bad video
[01:00:33] just you know be normal and don't give
[01:00:34] them hate cool cool we're on the same
[01:00:36] page okay this is called stop
[01:00:39] recommending hyper blue I'm not going to
[01:00:40] watch it all uh notably because it
[01:00:44] has I don't think dislike ratio is
[01:00:47] everything but for the record I don't
[01:00:49] have my most controversial
[01:00:51] video is this and this this
[01:00:56] has like and now it's irrelevant this is
[01:00:59] patch 1.6 so now this is going to look
[01:01:00] stupid by the way and this has like you
[01:01:02] know for the
[01:01:05] record if you're even remotely caught oh
[01:01:08] but I have to watch the intro before I
[01:01:10] watch the rest cuz if not it's out of
[01:01:11] context what are these called reality of
[01:01:14] hyper Bloom damage I've seen the Cals
[01:01:15] hyper teams are not special true low
[01:01:18] investment argument oh no oh
[01:01:22] no no don't count act the low investment
[01:01:32] argument your biggest controversy is
[01:01:34] when you said you like women and laughed
[01:01:36] dude saying okay listen I'm going to
[01:01:39] clarify this just saying that sentence
[01:01:41] out of context is like it's it's it's
[01:01:43] like it was like weird and out of
[01:01:45] context but yes I like women and I would
[01:01:47] like to assume and hope that my
[01:01:49] community likes women and we all do and
[01:01:51] respect them and are not there are no
[01:01:53] misogynists in my Community true and
[01:01:55] based okay it just was a random out like
[01:01:58] you forced me I was on the spot I said
[01:02:01] it and the context was funny that's
[01:02:07] all I don't like reacting to these
[01:02:10] videos because whatever I say is I don't
[01:02:14] like it I don't like it when I react to
[01:02:16] someone we'll just watch it to the quote
[01:02:18] unquote meta I have gench the past 2
[01:02:21] years you know that there is one thing
[01:02:22] in the game that's just buil different
[01:02:25] than the rest of the roster hyper Bloom
[01:02:27] the legendary Elemental reaction that
[01:02:29] does a more billion damage per rotation
[01:02:31] hyper bloom a team core that requires no
[01:02:33] also no one says hyper Bloom is like
[01:02:35] like the best like reaction Always by
[01:02:37] the way right like we know I'm sure that
[01:02:39] people here and like Theory crafters and
[01:02:41] stuff know that like you know I'd rather
[01:02:44] play Child changling and like a lot of
[01:02:46] other AOE teams than just hyper Blom all
[01:02:48] the time but it's very good and it's
[01:02:50] very low investment in the sense it's
[01:02:52] not low investment in the sense of oh my
[01:02:54] God God how try getting an em goblet
[01:02:56] it's so hard it's like look so you're
[01:02:58] going to get flower and feather are
[01:03:00] virtually not irrelevant but like you're
[01:03:03] going to get them before your other
[01:03:04] pieces and then you're going to get an
[01:03:06] em either circlet or goblet on top of
[01:03:09] your Sands the other one can be offset
[01:03:11] and the odds of you farming that
[01:03:13] especially if it's a set a domain like
[01:03:14] part of the reason by that cuz a lot of
[01:03:16] new people are flower of paradise Andes
[01:03:19] a big part of hyper being popular is I
[01:03:21] got super unlucky on Golden uh troop no
[01:03:24] gilded dreams what the [ __ ] is it called
[01:03:25] gilded dreams I got really dry on my em
[01:03:28] pieces and I still got it passively from
[01:03:30] farming for a good deepwood a good crit
[01:03:32] set for alham a good crit set for
[01:03:34] [ __ ] well Soo uses TF but you could
[01:03:36] use it on Soo like whoever right so a
[01:03:37] big part of it is you're going to get
[01:03:39] the EM passively while farming for other
[01:03:41] [ __ ] if you have to go out of your way
[01:03:43] to farm flower of Paradise Lost and try
[01:03:45] to get the best em [ __ ] Sands goblet
[01:03:48] circlet on set yeah yeah maybe it'll be
[01:03:50] easier to get a 6010 crit ratio on your
[01:03:52] Shang Ling Maybe I didn't watch this
[01:03:54] video yet by the way I'm just saying cuz
[01:03:56] I know that's a thing like people might
[01:03:57] take this and be like hey I got really
[01:03:58] unlucky on my em goblet let's look at
[01:04:00] the math of an em goblet like I get it
[01:04:02] but it's like a big part of it is you're
[01:04:03] going to passively get either a goblet
[01:04:06] or a circle you don't need both on like
[01:04:08] golden troop which is a very efficient
[01:04:12] gilded dream why can't I remember I keep
[01:04:14] confusing golden and gilded whatever the
[01:04:16] one with
[01:04:17] deepwood compared to like while you're
[01:04:19] farming your deepwood no investment no
[01:04:22] skill expression no will to live and no
[01:04:25] [ __ ] play optimally the all in all
[01:04:28] best cheapest most recommendable most
[01:04:31] free-to-play friendly way of clearing
[01:04:32] the abyss by far hyper
[01:04:37] Bloon also you don't need four Golden by
[01:04:39] the way if this is a big argument I
[01:04:41] don't know if this the point of the V
[01:04:42] video but if it is you can always go two
[01:04:43] wanders to Golden or two golden to
[01:04:45] gilded not golden [ __ ] me sideways you
[01:04:47] can always go two be2 be cuz it's only a
[01:04:49] little bit of em loss it's not like the
[01:04:50] biggest [ __ ] deal uh and a big part
[01:04:52] of your team's damage is also like s Jo
[01:04:54] and other
[01:04:55] characters great it's not just I would
[01:04:58] like to tear down this ridiculous
[01:04:59] pedestal that has held hyper blo up for
[01:05:01] so long and hopefully take a step in
[01:05:03] steering the community out of this
[01:05:05] deranged pothole that sucked all of us
[01:05:07] in balls deep for the past year and a
[01:05:09] half no if you think I have a point with
[01:05:11] what I'm about to say please leave a
[01:05:13] like and a subscribe if you think I
[01:05:14] should be crucified for my blasphemy
[01:05:18] Bas using solar healer cookie he might
[01:05:21] be on Prototype Amber
[01:05:23] Nita wait is he think I have a point
[01:05:26] with what I'm about to say we can't
[01:05:27] really see please leave a like and a
[01:05:30] subscribe if you think I should be
[01:05:31] crucified for my everyone just got
[01:05:32] healed though so it looks like
[01:05:34] it let's get this over
[01:05:41] with to properly comprehend why hyper
[01:05:43] Bloom isn't the Messiah that much of the
[01:05:45] community believes it to be we must
[01:05:47] first understand what it does and
[01:05:48] doesn't do wow what does it is simply an
[01:05:51] elemental reaction that does single
[01:05:52] Target damage wow es of transformative
[01:05:55] damage with every trigger which sounds
[01:05:57] perfectly
[01:05:59] fine uh one sec chat sorry I know I'm
[01:06:03] getting distracted but this just got
[01:06:05] tweeted 4.3 special program 7 a.m. on
[01:06:09] the
[01:06:12] 8th
[01:06:15] Friday oh [ __ ] NAIA in America okay bet
[01:06:19] we will be there we're going to watch
[01:06:21] party this we will watch party this
[01:06:24] Navia and
[01:06:29] America I like Navia she's cool and CH
[01:06:32] looks cool
[01:06:35] too Taylor Swift and genin dude I saw
[01:06:37] someone mad that people were comparing
[01:06:38] her with Taylor Swift dude they
[01:06:39] literally like why would you get mad at
[01:06:41] that it's not even an
[01:06:43] insult anyways yeah Taylor Swift and uh
[01:06:46] Chev so I'm
[01:06:53] excited
[01:06:55] it is did like it's fine bro keep in
[01:07:00] mind hyper Bloom isn't good with
[01:07:02] seahorse cuz the seahorse's attacks
[01:07:04] leaves Electro residues so the seahorse
[01:07:06] is basically hyper blooming you also
[01:07:09] hobly but this is where the disconnect
[01:07:12] between fantasy and reality happens what
[01:07:14] the community fails to understand is
[01:07:16] that the damage that hyper deals by
[01:07:18] itself while substantial is by no means
[01:07:21] gamebreaking or even an outlier you you
[01:07:24] can expect around 500k worth of hyper
[01:07:26] damage ration assuming you have a level
[01:07:29] 90 FM hyper Bloom trigger give or take
[01:07:33] to put this into perspect level
[01:07:35] 90 500k worth of hyper Bloom damage per
[01:07:38] 20 second rotation assuming is by no
[01:07:41] means game breing do they say how many
[01:07:43] targets they say single Target you can
[01:07:44] expect around 500k worth of hyper Bloom
[01:07:47] damage per 2 second rotation assuming
[01:07:49] you have a level 90 I mean hyper is
[01:07:51] mostly single Target but there's a very
[01:07:52] small AOE but to put this into
[01:07:54] perspective in a team like this and this
[01:07:57] isn't the best hyper Bloom team by any
[01:07:59] means but it certainly is a popular one
[01:08:02] more than half of your total DPS will
[01:08:04] come from Blue numbers AKA
[01:08:10] your okay one thing to say this is going
[01:08:14] to be I'm sure this video is filled with
[01:08:15] a bunch of valid uh points but you need
[01:08:18] to understand two things one if you're
[01:08:20] playing Singo and yon together yes
[01:08:22] they're going to carry your team when
[01:08:23] I'm playing and like what's a good
[01:08:25] example of this when I'm playing an
[01:08:26] onfield carry even dude when I play Hut
[01:08:29] finina yolan and Jean I often times
[01:08:32] swirl hydro and it's my hydros that are
[01:08:34] carrying not my Hut I know that's not
[01:08:36] like the best team like a lot of the
[01:08:37] times strong Hydro supporters are doing
[01:08:39] more than your [ __ ]
[01:08:40] reactions but and also here you don't
[01:08:43] have a like let's just let them talk
[01:08:45] your hydro character's personal damage
[01:08:48] believe it or not every single good
[01:08:50] hyper Bloom team possesses a damage
[01:08:52] profile consisting not primarily of
[01:08:54] hyper blo damage but of talent damage
[01:08:56] like any other good team sure hyper blo
[01:08:59] is simply a good source of sub DPS that
[01:09:01] you can incorporate into teams that you
[01:09:04] can teams consisting of already good
[01:09:05] units and not needing a lot of
[01:09:07] investment is he going to say that
[01:09:08] already good Sy you just need a
[01:09:10] character on like your healers on full
[01:09:11] em that do damage it has never been the
[01:09:14] sole focus and should not be regarded as
[01:09:16] such hyper blo itself does not do
[01:09:18] anywhere near enough damage to Solo
[01:09:20] Carry a team into being good no you
[01:09:23] can't can't just play Yao yo Barbara DMC
[01:09:25] and kie and expect a competent team for
[01:09:28] their sole Merit of it being hyper blo
[01:09:30] it just doesn't work that
[01:09:35] way I mean you can if you just change
[01:09:38] one of the
[01:09:41] units
[01:09:43] like I mean you actually technically
[01:09:45] could with this team it's just the
[01:09:47] amount of damage you'd gain by just
[01:09:48] having SRO would be very high test the
[01:09:52] team in the abyss I mean we
[01:09:56] could okay we can test Steam for the
[01:10:00] soul what is it let me write it down ya
[01:10:01] ya Barbara DMC cookie Merit of it being
[01:10:05] hyper Bloom it just doesn't work that
[01:10:11] way now that we've established the
[01:10:13] limited nature of hyper Bloom damage in
[01:10:15] contributing to good hyper Bloom teams
[01:10:17] how good actually are those good hyper
[01:10:19] Bloom teams okay please debunk alham
[01:10:22] yolan cookie Flex or like a team that's
[01:10:26] not just Nita on field nothing wrong
[01:10:28] with Nita on field but these are the
[01:10:29] only hybri teams I've seen have I missed
[01:10:31] some the only hyper teams I've seen are
[01:10:33] n onfield it's the only one I've seen in
[01:10:36] the game right now is double dendro
[01:10:38] hyper Bloom with Alam Nita and one of
[01:10:41] the three sing chos but once again and
[01:10:44] even more so with this team than the
[01:10:46] previous example hyperboom damage only
[01:10:48] contributes to a fraction yeah cuz
[01:10:50] you're running out H them and farita no
[01:10:53] [ __ ] it you're running alyam finina of
[01:10:56] course you don't need the hyper Blom but
[01:10:57] it's a big passive damage source that is
[01:10:59] literally nothing like it takes no
[01:11:01] effort at all you need Electro without
[01:11:03] Hy them you need a Healer without Hy
[01:11:05] them so the hyom is literally free it's
[01:11:07] entirely free it's fully free the
[01:11:10] alternative is running like fishal okay
[01:11:13] yeah FAL gives you damage but like FAL
[01:11:15] hym is only really good if you can FAL
[01:11:19] in between alam's burst and it's
[01:11:20] starting so you have to burst swap to
[01:11:21] fishal e or q and then swap back them
[01:11:24] which me testing on the high paying Asia
[01:11:25] server wasn't consistent me doing on my
[01:11:27] main account I can do but if you get
[01:11:29] interrupted it [ __ ] it up so yeah
[01:11:31] totally he's beefing I am not beefing at
[01:11:32] all I think realistically I'm going to
[01:11:34] finish watching this video and be like
[01:11:35] this guy has good points but words it in
[01:11:36] a bad way but I think that's their point
[01:11:38] so they get they can call it like
[01:11:41] this cuz for example I think okay this
[01:11:45] is nothing like I don't want to compare
[01:11:47] this to zff cuz zff has mostly good
[01:11:50] genin takes well he has some bad takes
[01:11:52] like uh like everything that I listen we
[01:11:55] disagree a lot okay but I love him and I
[01:11:57] think he has a lot of really good meta
[01:11:58] advice a lot of really good build advice
[01:12:00] a lot of good advice overall however the
[01:12:02] one thing
[01:12:04] I think is z Jeff's weak point is
[01:12:08] wording things in a way that doesn't
[01:12:10] make people hate him and I think this
[01:12:12] video so far is like this community is
[01:12:14] glorifying hyper blo you [ __ ] losers
[01:12:17] like I know that's not what he's saying
[01:12:18] but it's like dude where you can present
[01:12:20] your point
[01:12:22] differently anyways team DPS the fact
[01:12:25] that this team is so strong is very much
[01:12:27] a combined effort between Talent damage
[01:12:29] and Hyper Bloom damage with Talent
[01:12:31] damage being the main contributor yeah
[01:12:33] of course you're playing Alam alam's
[01:12:34] broken well really noten team are
[01:12:37] fantastic they're by no means outliers
[01:12:40] compared to the Myriad of other top
[01:12:41] teams that don't make use of hyper Bloom
[01:12:43] at all n let carry yeah no [ __ ] n let
[01:12:47] I'm going a cream also also this team
[01:12:51] has a significant amount of damage
[01:12:52] that's finina and
[01:12:54] which is the same argument he's making
[01:12:55] about hyper blo like a big part of your
[01:12:56] team's damage isn't just a Hut but I
[01:12:59] mean Hut does a lot here
[01:13:01] too Vape P spread Al haam kazua
[01:13:04] aggravate double Hydro EC swirl L monop
[01:13:07] pyro nuu Bloom etc etc wait all
[01:13:10] of double Hydro EC swirl line monop
[01:13:17] pyro is this a C6 Bennett
[01:13:22] Kaza blue is this Lenny they don't have
[01:13:24] oh they might not have Lenny they might
[01:13:25] not have Lenny they might not have Lenny
[01:13:26] okay they don't have Linny never mind no
[01:13:27] flame no flame no flame they don't have
[01:13:28] Lenny etc etc all of these teams listed
[01:13:31] above and many more are very much
[01:13:34] competitive and sometimes superior to
[01:13:36] the best of hyper Bloom teams at any
[01:13:38] given investment level does that mean
[01:13:40] hyper Bloom teams are bad no not at all
[01:13:43] as I said good hyper Bloom teams are
[01:13:45] among the best in the game they just
[01:13:46] aren't anything special true I think if
[01:13:50] anything he's talking to the wrong
[01:13:51] people that are saying hyper like no I I
[01:13:53] don't think I've met a TC saying like
[01:13:55] yeah hyperon is better than like the top
[01:13:57] meta teams I think the main argument
[01:13:59] that I've seen people make and that I
[01:14:01] have made a lot of times is like hey by
[01:14:03] the way hyper Bloom can get you to the
[01:14:05] DPS check you're looking for to clear
[01:14:07] the abyss a lot
[01:14:10] faster like it can get you there very
[01:14:13] easily not easily cuz I know like I
[01:14:16] don't
[01:14:20] know ton of casual content creators
[01:14:23] saying hyper Bloom is the best hyper
[01:14:24] Bloom is really good with low effort
[01:14:28] like listen if I'm playing Sino SRO like
[01:14:32] not okay well like yeah Soo what does he
[01:14:35] want a Dango character what's like the
[01:14:36] best support in the game SRO you're
[01:14:38] literally hyper bloing by accident like
[01:14:40] you don't need the [ __ ] hyper looms
[01:14:41] they just happen a lot of teams or like
[01:14:43] let's say you're playing like
[01:14:45] SRO uh who's a good carer I mean I don't
[01:14:47] want to use alyam again but we'll use
[01:14:48] alyam again let play alyam SRO no [ __ ]
[01:14:51] SRO alham Electro there's like no reason
[01:14:54] not to add a hydro like unless you're
[01:14:56] playing like fishal and you like don't
[01:14:57] have em on your characters sure but it's
[01:15:00] like it's so easy to just passively
[01:15:02] hyper Bloom with your healer because you
[01:15:03] need a Healer in the team the
[01:15:05] alternative is like okay you're not
[01:15:06] running a Healer you could do like
[01:15:07] fishal Jong Le I'll hi them and then you
[01:15:09] can Flex the last slot you might not
[01:15:11] hyper Bloom whatever but it's like I
[01:15:13] don't know I think it's just like free a
[01:15:16] lot of the times and it doesn't need a
[01:15:18] lot of investment and it's really good
[01:15:19] single Target and a lot of abysses right
[01:15:21] now are very uh one of the two Hal they
[01:15:23] make it single Target in the past it's
[01:15:25] like it was very AOE abysses when venty
[01:15:28] was really good um honestly Shia too but
[01:15:32] anyways well not like you know copium
[01:15:34] but you know what I mean but now there's
[01:15:36] a lot of like
[01:15:40] yeah I agree low investment argument is
[01:15:42] kind of bad because most people don't
[01:15:43] have a limit to high investment you
[01:15:44] could be talking about 100K resonant
[01:15:45] artifacts for example yeah but oh okay
[01:15:49] okay this is important I need to specify
[01:15:52] this okay okay we are talking about the
[01:15:55] floor not ceiling right yeah the floor
[01:15:58] to Nine Star clear floor 12 that's it
[01:16:01] that's all that [ __ ] matters and I
[01:16:03] like I get it you might want to speedrun
[01:16:04] you might want to clear way faster you
[01:16:06] might want to get a [ __ ] 300 crit
[01:16:07] damage sh like this guy I get it but the
[01:16:11] bar to Nine Star Abyss is what matters
[01:16:14] for most like when we talk about low
[01:16:17] investment when we talk about ease of
[01:16:18] axis when we talk about people just
[01:16:20] wanting to [ __ ] get their Primo gems
[01:16:21] that's what we're looking for it's the
[01:16:23] ease of just getting to that level which
[01:16:26] is why I'm saying things like you can
[01:16:28] clear with any character in the game but
[01:16:30] it might take you a bit harder to clear
[01:16:31] with [ __ ] like I was going to say
[01:16:33] Noel but Noel's actually pretty good
[01:16:34] with finina you know decent um you know
[01:16:37] like Razer now Razer you can Dude every
[01:16:40] character has the team whatever Barbara
[01:16:42] DPS she can hyper
[01:16:48] blo well although hyper Bloom teams
[01:16:51] don't necessarily do more than other
[01:16:52] good teams teams in the end surely
[01:16:55] there's still the fastest way of
[01:16:56] reaching damage thresholds at lower
[01:16:58] investment watch she's going to average
[01:16:59] the chance of an em goblet the answer gu
[01:17:02] I guar no the idea that hyper Bloom
[01:17:05] requires lower investment is
[01:17:07] fundamentally wrong in two ways firstly
[01:17:09] as I've explained earlier building just
[01:17:12] a hyper Bloom trigger will not get you
[01:17:13] anywhere near the damage of a full team
[01:17:16] in other words playing hyper Bloom does
[01:17:18] not spare you from needing to build
[01:17:19] other characters yep secondly getting a
[01:17:22] full Yem main stat set for hyper Bloom
[01:17:24] is not
[01:17:25] NE simply building a DPS set for a Talon
[01:17:28] damage dealer to begin with I know
[01:17:30] multiple people with top ranking
[01:17:32] Wanderer sets by the time their flop
[01:17:34] domain finally decided to yeah stop
[01:17:37] doing flop okay I said this earlier
[01:17:40] listen a big reason I pretend flop
[01:17:43] doesn't exist is because you need to
[01:17:45] build a dento character for hyper
[01:17:47] anyways you want good deepwood you
[01:17:48] probably want good gilded so you're
[01:17:50] going to get gilded as you're farming
[01:17:54] like let's say you want to build your
[01:17:55] alyam or your Sino do you know what's
[01:17:56] cool as you get good crit you're also
[01:17:59] going to get em pieces it's not just
[01:18:01] like if you calculate in a vacuum how
[01:18:03] much em it takes you to get like how
[01:18:05] much resin it takes you to get a good em
[01:18:06] set it might look bad okay if all you
[01:18:09] want from all you want for your hyper
[01:18:12] team is just flower Paradise Lost you
[01:18:14] might have a better time and this is a
[01:18:17] good point I'll give it to him you might
[01:18:19] he didn't even make the point yet but
[01:18:20] I'm sure he will you might have a better
[01:18:21] time going and farming emblem building
[01:18:23] your SRO Shang Ling yalan building
[01:18:25] another team than just grinding for em
[01:18:27] and in that case I would genuinely
[01:18:29] rather you go two piece 80m twopiece 80m
[01:18:32] and the [ __ ] flop domain can suck my
[01:18:34] left nut sure but I'm also
[01:18:38] saying it's a very like especially uh
[01:18:42] the reason why we kind of disavow flop
[01:18:44] is cuz like unless you want the other
[01:18:46] domain you probably have a good
[01:18:49] gilded not accidentally but like as
[01:18:51] you're farming for the other stats youi
[01:18:53] cuz so many characters want gilded or
[01:18:55] deepwood especially and this was
[01:18:57] especially true before 4.0 because now a
[01:19:00] lot of characters can use Mar CH a lot
[01:19:01] of characters can use Golden dreams
[01:19:03] golden troop gilded [ __ ] the other one
[01:19:05] the one that uh gives you skill damage
[01:19:07] like Fel for example went from her best
[01:19:09] in slot being for gilded well it was VI
[01:19:12] like you could go four thunder so or
[01:19:13] substats but like four gilded was there
[01:19:17] and then golden troop Now is better so
[01:19:18] it's like it used to be even more true
[01:19:21] that there was way more of a reason to
[01:19:23] farm that domain even if you didn't want
[01:19:25] to do hyper Loom even if you didn't care
[01:19:26] about hyper Loom you were farming golden
[01:19:28] troop for like fishal Yi a bunch of
[01:19:30] supports alham a bunch of DPSS deepwood
[01:19:32] for any dendo character like there's so
[01:19:34] like even you could use [ __ ] on like
[01:19:36] tanari like there's so many characters
[01:19:38] that could use that
[01:19:39] [ __ ] but now I will admit there's more
[01:19:44] of a reason to do other domains with the
[01:19:46] rec 4.0 onwards so if you literally
[01:19:50] don't need any set well you still want
[01:19:52] deep but if you're playing hyper Loom so
[01:19:54] my point still stands but if you don't
[01:19:55] need any of them then yeah it might be a
[01:19:57] waste of just [ __ ] Farm flaw for em
[01:19:59] drop an onet em goblet for them with
[01:20:03] just how utterly rare Elemental Mastery
[01:20:05] main stats are it actually requires a
[01:20:07] very comparable oh my God I knew it I
[01:20:09] [ __ ] knew it kill me now for hyper
[01:20:11] blo as it is to acquire a basic
[01:20:13] functional set for any given crit
[01:20:15] scaling damage dealer and it is actually
[01:20:17] faster to farm a serviceable set for
[01:20:19] characters who can utilize more substats
[01:20:21] or main stats like Hut chaning or no
[01:20:24] light building a competent hyperboom
[01:20:26] trigger often times is equivalent to
[01:20:28] building a good sub DPS in terms of
[01:20:30] resin investment and gain for your
[01:20:31] damage it is a perfectly valid option to
[01:20:34] pursue if the units on your account line
[01:20:36] up for it nicely but it is not
[01:20:38] inherently easier or quicker to
[01:20:39] accomplish than the other options well
[01:20:43] it it's true but also you can do
[01:20:45] twopiece twopiece or you yeah you can
[01:20:47] literally okay I don't have the math on
[01:20:49] this so if I'm wrong spank me but you
[01:20:51] literally can go for like a fourstar
[01:20:54] goblet right like you can literally use
[01:20:56] like let's say you're super unlucky
[01:20:58] can't you do like a fourstar em goblet
[01:20:59] you lose what four levels I know this is
[01:21:02] Fields crafting but like is it really
[01:21:05] going to [ __ ] you that
[01:21:10] hard and it's like at the same time
[01:21:13] you're farming like an efficient domain
[01:21:15] do like deepo is a very efficient domain
[01:21:18] gen generally like unless you literally
[01:21:20] don't care about your dental character
[01:21:22] anymore
[01:21:33] hyper blo is simply a piece of a puzzle
[01:21:35] along with a sea of others available at
[01:21:37] your disposal that you may choose to
[01:21:39] assist you in building functional teams
[01:21:41] around synergistic units okay so far so
[01:21:43] good and has never been the endol up nor
[01:21:46] are teams that use a combination of
[01:21:48] random [ __ ] units paired together for
[01:21:49] the sole purpose of generating hyper
[01:21:51] blooms okay loan that can work though
[01:21:53] that's the only like low key it can kind
[01:21:54] of work but true easiest most low
[01:21:56] investment ways of clearing
[01:22:01] the abyss believe it or not was that
[01:22:04] last ways of clearing the abyss
[01:22:06] generating hyper blooms the easiest most
[01:22:08] low investment ways of clearing the
[01:22:10] abyss believe it or not nothing good in
[01:22:12] this game is Balan around just its
[01:22:14] ability to generate hyper blooms not
[01:22:16] Nita not tcho and definitely not
[01:22:19] nvite the way hyper blo has been treated
[01:22:22] in the past last year and a half is akin
[01:22:23] to this one restaurant you found when
[01:22:25] you just moved to a new town thought
[01:22:27] their food tasted pretty good and the
[01:22:28] location was pretty convenient then out
[01:22:30] of nowhere decided to adamantly claim it
[01:22:33] as the best restaurant in town Bar None
[01:22:35] when in reality dozens of other joints
[01:22:37] around serve an array of Cuisine that
[01:22:39] tastes just as good and very you guys
[01:22:41] say Z analogy anyway I urge you to stop
[01:22:45] centralizing your thinking around hyper
[01:22:46] glom in this damn game don't try to
[01:22:48] evaluate new units based on how they
[01:22:50] stack wait a second okay guys am I okay
[01:22:53] I actually forgot about this isn't ula's
[01:22:55] highest DPS team a hyper Bloom team like
[01:22:57] objectively I'm not joking right now I
[01:22:59] don't know like answer me is wasn't it
[01:23:01] actually the highest like there's a
[01:23:04] reason why not anymore because of finina
[01:23:06] okay before finina sure before finina uh
[01:23:09] finina is actually cracked by the way
[01:23:10] people are saying Fin's like H she's not
[01:23:12] that Fin's actually cracked but anyways
[01:23:14] there's a big reason why whenever I'm
[01:23:17] doing like a frem a showcase I just
[01:23:18] Chuck him in a hyper Bloom team because
[01:23:20] the other characters in that team kind
[01:23:22] of [ __ ] carry while you're on field
[01:23:23] and cryo has Synergy
[01:23:26] there does that mean it's inherently the
[01:23:28] most low investment no well it is
[01:23:31] actually because of the other stuff I
[01:23:33] talked about and definitely don't try to
[01:23:35] evaluate them by how they perform in
[01:23:37] hyper Bloom teams when they have no
[01:23:39] inherent Synergy with it believe it or
[01:23:41] not the best way to get Risley to clear
[01:23:43] Abyss for a new player will never be to
[01:23:45] build a hyper obviously not it's rly if
[01:23:47] you like the shits and giggles of seeing
[01:23:48] colorful numbers on your screen all the
[01:23:50] power to you just know that what you're
[01:23:52] doing is a meme and not a real
[01:23:57] recommendation fridge isn't a worthless
[01:23:59] interaction you actually get more blooms
[01:24:00] for Hy uh per Hydro op because the hydro
[01:24:02] will freeze and then Bloom and then
[01:24:03] you'll get more Dental cores uh per each
[01:24:06] but it is what it is you know it's
[01:24:08] okay that was a lot of ranting once
[01:24:11] again please subscribe so I can do more
[01:24:12] of these videos Team Series will I get
[01:24:16] it if you're a dumbass and you okay not
[01:24:17] a dumbass sorry if you're uh like if
[01:24:19] you're like new to the game right like
[01:24:20] obviously like there's no shame in being
[01:24:22] new or not knowing stuff I don't want it
[01:24:23] to seem like I'm like being like that
[01:24:24] cuz it doesn't matter like the less
[01:24:26] knowledge you have about genin the
[01:24:27] better cuz it means you touch more grass
[01:24:28] so you're better than me I'm just saying
[01:24:30] let's say you're like OAB boonga right
[01:24:32] you're like OAB boonga hyper Bloom good
[01:24:35] I don't need to level my talents or my
[01:24:36] characters or like well you need to
[01:24:37] level your characters but I don't care
[01:24:39] about my talents I don't care about my
[01:24:40] characters hyper Bloom yeah obviously
[01:24:43] you want your SRO to do damage yeah
[01:24:45] obviously you want your other characters
[01:24:46] to deal
[01:24:48] damage but like
[01:24:51] bro I don't
[01:24:56] know if you're building your team for
[01:24:59] the hyper Loom reaction damage and
[01:25:00] nothing else like literally nothing else
[01:25:03] yes it's not
[01:25:05] ideal I mean dude it worked
[01:25:12] it like obviously you want your hydro
[01:25:15] character which is like the most broken
[01:25:17] [ __ ] element in the game to do damage
[01:25:19] to yeah you want your like dendral
[01:25:21] character to do damage if they can
[01:25:24] yeah but like even without that I think
[01:25:27] it lowkey works a
[01:25:29] little I would try the team but we
[01:25:31] didn't even do the abyss yet like it
[01:25:32] just
[01:25:34] reset but like I'm pretty sure I could
[01:25:36] just play a bunch of random dog [ __ ] uh
[01:25:38] this Abyss is more annoying though this
[01:25:39] Abyss isn't like a standard one well I
[01:25:41] mean second half it would work it's just
[01:25:44] Jade Plum has high DZ
[01:25:46] so uh it would be worse than it should
[01:25:48] be if I do second
[01:25:51] half reset six days ago okay well I
[01:25:54] wasn't home I just got
[01:25:57] home this guy said it's 500k 20 seconds
[01:25:59] is not good enough when that is
[01:26:01] literally enough to Nine Star wait did
[01:26:04] he say it's not good enough comprehend
[01:26:08] why hyper blo is simply an element
[01:26:11] damage with every
[01:26:12] trigger
[01:26:15] that around 500k worth of hyper Bloom
[01:26:18] damage per 20 second rotation assuming
[01:26:20] you have a level 90 fully hyper Blom
[01:26:22] trigger give or take to put this into
[01:26:25] perspective in a team like this and this
[01:26:28] isn't the best hyper Bloom team by any
[01:26:30] means but it certainly is a popular one
[01:26:32] more than half of your total DPS will
[01:26:35] come from Blue numbers AKA your hydro
[01:26:37] characters personal damage believe it or
[01:26:40] not every single good hyperboom team
[01:26:42] possesses a damage profile consisting
[01:26:46] not like okay uh this I know this
[01:26:49] website has its like issues and stuff
[01:26:51] like it's not like the most like yeah
[01:26:53] always reliable like use these numbers
[01:26:55] out of context but like for example
[01:26:57] right a lot of teams uh a Neu Bloom with
[01:27:00] Alam by is really good A lot of people
[01:27:02] kind of underrate it I mean I used to
[01:27:03] underrate it too uh but it is pretty
[01:27:05] good but in general right a lot of alham
[01:27:07] teams for
[01:27:09] example if you look at the damage
[01:27:11] distribution a lot of it will be this
[01:27:13] side is fake news yeah I mean this side
[01:27:15] is kind of [ __ ] but like I don't know
[01:27:16] what a better one is what's the what's
[01:27:18] is there any one that people use the
[01:27:19] WeChat one wait what's the WeChat one
[01:27:24] like I've seen spreadsheets but I don't
[01:27:25] want to pull up a random spreadsheet I
[01:27:27] don't know if this actually a
[01:27:29] website play the game yeah but you can't
[01:27:31] see anything from that there's no
[01:27:32] actually test in
[01:27:34] game does Anka have one is that a real
[01:27:36] like does that one work meat
[01:27:40] spin anyways point is yeah I guess this
[01:27:45] won't really show the I mean it kind of
[01:27:46] still shows the
[01:27:50] point what whatever point
[01:27:54] is whoever told him to react to this
[01:27:57] dude it's not a stun
[01:28:01] blck someone agree about makes hyper
[01:28:03] thank you Danny I I will give you a kiss
[01:28:06] right now I will give you a kiss right
[01:28:08] now what makes high cheap is the domain
[01:28:10] itself de and Guild have two really good
[01:28:12] sets that we use on a lot of different
[01:28:13] characters
[01:28:15] true also electrod dendro Hydra is
[01:28:17] really good
[01:28:21] true
[01:28:23] also true comfortes autopilot gameplay
[01:28:26] instead amount of variations not yeah
[01:28:29] true but also like
[01:28:33] okay obviously you shouldn't build your
[01:28:35] account around having a team that just
[01:28:37] has a hyper Loom character and no one
[01:28:39] else do damage but I also feel like even
[01:28:41] if you do that you should you might
[01:28:43] still be able like you probably still
[01:28:44] will be able to clear am I wrong like I
[01:28:46] feel like we can do a dog [ __ ] ass team
[01:28:48] but it'll still
[01:28:51] work
[01:28:56] we'll do
[01:29:04] it do the team from the video yeah I
[01:29:07] mean we
[01:29:11] could the dra probably has done it by
[01:29:13] now he definitely did there's no way he
[01:29:20] didn't
[01:29:25] I think it's just I mean it's it's fine
[01:29:28] it's I shouldn't even react to stuff
[01:29:29] like this cuz it's probably decent
[01:29:30] points but we in a way that's very click
[01:29:32] bitable which is okay like I respect the
[01:29:34] grind but like you know I think it's
[01:29:44] also yeah it's also like okay stuff like
[01:29:48] this well it's not like really low
[01:29:51] increas but like
[01:29:52] stuff where it's
[01:29:54] like you I I don't know what like when I
[01:29:57] like
[01:29:59] okay if I'm coping Sayo you're [ __ ]
[01:30:02] coping but like not only do you not need
[01:30:04] sub stats on these pieces but like you
[01:30:06] literally could like I don't I threw
[01:30:08] away my fourstar ones but literally
[01:30:10] during the farming process you can dead
[01:30:13] ass use a fourstar how much em less is
[01:30:15] this I'm actually going to level this I
[01:30:16] don't care [ __ ] it uh do I have any XP
[01:30:19] I'll just Auto
[01:30:20] add
[01:30:23] I could just Google this but I don't
[01:30:29] care 48 less well I'm leveling
[01:30:33] it we'll
[01:30:42] see well this is definitely a
[01:30:45] waste of my hard-earned
[01:30:48] artifacts especially the 35 XP bro
[01:30:53] whatever so 139 instead of
[01:30:57] 187 wow Z can't M that's 50- 2 right 50
[01:31:01] - 2 so
[01:31:07] 48 that's like
[01:31:10] Dude
[01:31:11] bro that's literally not even bad what
[01:31:16] the
[01:31:16] [ __ ] you can literally I mean it's
[01:31:19] pretty bad but bro it's one piece if
[01:31:22] you're unlucky like on average you'll
[01:31:24] probably get a main stat of either a
[01:31:27] goblet or a circlet not both while Anand
[01:31:30] so two of the three while farming for
[01:31:31] your other
[01:31:36] characters or you minus 48 instead
[01:31:38] that's the alternative minus
[01:31:44] 48 48 * 3 not times three what the [ __ ]
[01:31:49] okay do you guys not understand well not
[01:31:50] you guys but like the one one guy in
[01:31:52] chat not understand that off pieces
[01:31:54] exist and you're also going to like
[01:31:56] first of all on average farming this
[01:31:58] domain you're going to get em if you're
[01:32:00] building other characters at the same
[01:32:01] time but if you don't cuz let's say for
[01:32:04] some reason it's not an efficient domain
[01:32:05] for you which usually it will be
[01:32:07] especially if you're playing a dender
[01:32:08] team where you need deepwood anyways one
[01:32:10] four star on set and then an off piece
[01:32:13] like dude all you need is one of the
[01:32:15] three then because you have one of the
[01:32:16] three on set one of the three offset
[01:32:18] from just playing the game and then one
[01:32:20] of the three as a four star which is a
[01:32:23] lot
[01:32:26] easier yeah is 10% on Sand Sans is fine
[01:32:29] yeah so there you go you literally yeah
[01:32:31] dude what the [ __ ] that is so much
[01:32:33] easier if you can literally one of the
[01:32:35] two you ignore the other two you fourar
[01:32:37] boom and then you have a four piece
[01:32:38] gilded which is uh efficient anyways cuz
[01:32:41] it's gilded you can't clear abys with
[01:32:43] that yes you you think you need the 40
[01:32:45] em to clear Abyss
[01:32:48] 40 it's 40 em
[01:32:55] what the
[01:33:06] [ __ ]
[01:33:12] yeah but
[01:33:14] yeah
[01:33:17] anyways your best Hydro is Barbara yeah
[01:33:20] I mean well that's also why I say I'm
[01:33:23] going to make a video about the best uh
[01:33:24] the most valuable five star characters
[01:33:27] and something I always say is the less
[01:33:30] Hydro characters you have the more one
[01:33:32] is valuable and if you've been playing
[01:33:33] genin for long enough to clear the abyss
[01:33:36] there's a very very very very high
[01:33:38] chance you have one of the following
[01:33:40] hydros one I'm not saying all I'm saying
[01:33:42] one SRO
[01:33:44] Ayo child kokomi yolan nuu finina nuu is
[01:33:50] a bit of an exception but whatever
[01:33:52] uh nlet who actually let's just filter
[01:33:54] by
[01:33:55] Hydro or Mona any of those literally one
[01:34:00] of any of those is a incredible increase
[01:34:03] to your account like the more Hydra you
[01:34:07] have the less a new one will affect it
[01:34:09] which is why yeah if you have every
[01:34:10] Hydro character in the game like finina
[01:34:12] can still have really strong teams cuz
[01:34:14] she's really good but like she might not
[01:34:16] feel as like oh my God I need her like
[01:34:17] you know you probably don't she's good
[01:34:19] but you probably don't need her but it's
[01:34:23] like the odds are you'll probably get
[01:34:27] one other Hydro character minimum like
[01:34:29] you'll probably get SRO plus another
[01:34:31] right probably because even if you don't
[01:34:32] you're like okay I hate Hydro characters
[01:34:34] you'll probably lose the 50/50 and get
[01:34:35] mono and it's like you might want kokomi
[01:34:37] you might want AO you might want child
[01:34:38] you might want nlet NE if you're playing
[01:34:40] Bloom uh but she's more Niche yolon well
[01:34:42] really good but Niche or [ __ ] finina
[01:34:45] s you can also get in the shop that's
[01:34:47] true so it's like if you only have
[01:34:50] barbaras a hydro would I recommend you
[01:34:51] play hyper
[01:34:52] Bloom probably like maybe not right
[01:34:56] maybe not well maybe not but it's like
[01:35:00] at some point you're going to get a
[01:35:01] [ __ ] hydro and the hydro characters
[01:35:03] are broken so it's not a sacrifice to
[01:35:05] play a hydro reaction team anyways like
[01:35:07] it's not like oh [ __ ] man I have to play
[01:35:10] [ __ ] I have to play sucros fishal Singo
[01:35:13] and aita [ __ ] it's like the team's good
[01:35:16] anyways well obviously you'd want a
[01:35:17] Healer maybe but you get my point like
[01:35:20] it's like you're playing a good like
[01:35:22] good Hydro is really good Electro
[01:35:24] characters are often times really good
[01:35:25] or you play kie who A Healer and Hyper
[01:35:27] blooms D characters are generally pretty
[01:35:29] good where case you have DMC who's not
[01:35:31] like particularly good but they're fine
[01:35:33] and then your last character is just a
[01:35:34] good character yeah literally every
[01:35:36] Hydro five star is usually good
[01:35:38] right yeah obviously child you don't
[01:35:41] really hyper blue like you're more of
[01:35:42] like a Shang linger but all of these
[01:35:43] characters are
[01:35:45] good except for Mona Mona's dude she's a
[01:35:48] standard she's fine like I wouldn't
[01:35:50] recommend her for like hyper Bloom like
[01:35:52] obviously Mona Mona yeah Mona is like
[01:35:54] for different stuff but Mona for like
[01:35:56] freeze and [ __ ] is
[01:36:01] okay but what Mona is okay what is okay
[01:36:05] I get that Mona's clunky and and like
[01:36:06] you want to hate your life if you're
[01:36:07] playing freeze with Mona instead of
[01:36:08] kokomi I get it but getting her if your
[01:36:11] only other Hydro is SRO who I'm going to
[01:36:13] assume you have from the shop which
[01:36:15] means he's free technically if you play
[01:36:17] the game for just a few months which you
[01:36:19] should by the time you get to the abyss
[01:36:20] unless you're speedr running and which
[01:36:21] case good job but anyways uh assuming
[01:36:24] you have sing Cho Mona as like your
[01:36:26] whatever for freeze or whatever copium
[01:36:28] or whatever is good enough to allow you
[01:36:30] to play s in your hyper bloom or other
[01:36:32] like Shang Ling team and then ideally
[01:36:34] you'll get another Hydro character
[01:36:35] you'll get yolan you'll get finina
[01:36:36] you'll get AO you'll get nlet you'll get
[01:36:38] child you get K you'll get someone
[01:36:40] else anyways
[01:36:44] cool let's get to
[01:36:50] flor2 also oh my God how did I forget
[01:36:53] this
[01:36:55] also do you know what a big thing for
[01:36:58] hyper BL when it came out I feel like
[01:37:00] okay no disrespect to this person like
[01:37:02] actually no disrespect like it is what
[01:37:03] it is I feel like like it's like as if
[01:37:05] they started playing today like yeah
[01:37:07] maybe today you're fing flop and you
[01:37:09] have finina and you don't well if you
[01:37:10] have finina you can still play that team
[01:37:11] but then you don't want to do deepwood
[01:37:13] for some reason cool don't do it but
[01:37:15] like Not only was the domate efficient
[01:37:17] also guess who has played in every team
[01:37:21] but not hyper Bloom this [ __ ]
[01:37:24] yeah now there's more teams with Fin and
[01:37:26] like there's other stuff you could do
[01:37:28] sure but guess who has played in
[01:37:30] literally every team that wasn't hyper
[01:37:33] Bloom and like some dend Rea like dender
[01:37:35] reactions which is a big reason why hey
[01:37:38] man you want to play your really strong
[01:37:40] Bennett team well guess what you're
[01:37:42] doing second half uh I don't know Hydro
[01:37:44] character while she wasn't out but Hydro
[01:37:46] character uh maybe a dendro character
[01:37:48] maybe an Electro and you don't even need
[01:37:49] a last character
[01:37:53] so it's like you
[01:38:03] know oh
[01:38:07] yeah do Abyss with those lineups I mean
[01:38:10] if I can fill the characters I I
[01:38:13] mean this team doesn't actually need a
[01:38:15] lot like I could do this with three
[01:38:16] characters but this team obviously would
[01:38:18] want like something like this I could sh
[01:38:22] or hyper like uh not hyper Blom [ __ ]
[01:38:24] Vape
[01:38:29] anyways all right let's uh go to 412 now
[01:38:32] we need to unlock
[01:38:40] it 100 minute
[01:38:43] intro I'm not looking at his National
[01:38:45] take stop stop you guys are getting
[01:38:48] click baited you guys are getting click
[01:38:50] baited
[01:38:51] you guys are getting click baited stop
[01:39:17] it another test
[01:39:20] subject sharing my knowledge sharing my
[01:39:22] knowledge outlines
[01:39:25] your with me into the
[01:39:33] wind going
[01:39:36] somewhere my
[01:39:38] sword another test subject huh finally
[01:39:47] iow your head second
[01:39:52] to the very finally H another test
[01:39:58] subject
[01:40:05] ow do put domain so good I got a better
[01:40:08] Ryden build while farming for Nikita
[01:40:09] even after one year of emblem Dam oh sh
[01:40:13] I muted alerts I'm sorry I unmuted
[01:40:17] them like I don't know man I'm very like
[01:40:21] understanding of like I know how YouTube
[01:40:23] works so I get that even if you have a
[01:40:25] good point if you word in a bad way
[01:40:27] people will get mad at you but I think
[01:40:29] like some of the takes are good some of
[01:40:31] them are just like like why are you
[01:40:33] choosing to have that argument it's like
[01:40:35] I don't know to the people that think
[01:40:37] you just like can build no team but just
[01:40:40] have a reaction and not level your
[01:40:42] characters and not build your characters
[01:40:43] sure like I I get that they're dumb but
[01:40:46] like I don't
[01:40:48] know the weird H to die it's like okay
[01:40:53] you know the like drama Farmers that
[01:40:54] will find one Twitter reply and like
[01:40:56] make an essay about how the community is
[01:40:58] outraged over something when it's one
[01:41:00] person like I know there's a lot of
[01:41:02] people who think okay hyper Blom is just
[01:41:04] always so broken that it carries
[01:41:06] everything which I mean to a certain
[01:41:09] extent if you understand how to build a
[01:41:11] team is kind of true cuz like if you are
[01:41:13] building a good Hydro unit with a good
[01:41:15] dentro unit then it is true like it'll
[01:41:18] do a lot but like if you're not building
[01:41:20] your characters properly and you're just
[01:41:21] relying on the reaction then yeah yeah
[01:41:23] you might be getting like [ __ ] click
[01:41:25] baited by people you might be getting
[01:41:27] baited into thinking hyper Loom and not
[01:41:29] building your other characters but like
[01:41:32] I don't
[01:41:34] know hyper is broken CU electar is
[01:41:36] broken I mean that that's another thing
[01:41:38] taser teams even before djo were really
[01:41:40] good and now it's like okay well what if
[01:41:42] I just Chuck a djo character
[01:41:46] there I see everything like this team
[01:41:49] could clear everything
[01:41:51] realistically without hyper blooming
[01:41:53] like well maybe not but like like I
[01:41:55] would replac Kaza but
[01:41:59] like it's like it's not just the hyper
[01:42:01] doing all the damage but it's a big
[01:42:03] extra amount of
[01:42:04] damage for free My
[01:42:08] Sword what's the taser team uh
[01:42:11] electrocharge so like bet official for
[01:42:13] example oh bet official SRO for example
[01:42:15] with like sucros or like Ayo bet ficial
[01:42:20] like Hydro official is a good uh combo
[01:42:22] but you don't need bait official it's
[01:42:23] basically just Electro
[01:42:28] charge
[01:42:31] your T still good yes T's still good
[01:42:35] especially um I think if there's an
[01:42:38] abyss with two enemies or like three but
[01:42:40] especially two bet is really really
[01:42:49] good
[01:43:00] [Music]
[01:43:14] you tried the team yet no not
[01:43:19] yet
[01:43:21] Here Comes The Catch evil conquering
[01:43:25] worthless what's the highest damage
[01:43:27] hyperm team whichever team has good
[01:43:29] units and then you just hyper Lo on the
[01:43:30] side your hyper reactions
[01:43:33] always not exactly the same but mostly
[01:43:35] the same you're getting the EM from your
[01:43:37] Kookie plus whatever Buffs from like
[01:43:38] deepwood Nikita's em share whatever
[01:43:40] right but it's like your hyper damage is
[01:43:43] basically the same it's
[01:43:45] just like it changes a bit but like it's
[01:43:48] basically the same but what changes is
[01:43:50] like the other characters [ __ ] I'll
[01:43:52] hide them as a DPS boom a bunch of
[01:43:54] damage Nita a bunch of damage Soo [ __ ]
[01:43:56] well Soo copium but like you
[01:43:59] know a bunch of stuff boom a bunch of
[01:44:02] damage that guy is a Jeff hater surely
[01:44:05] not right Surly
[01:44:10] not means
[01:44:14] the will
[01:44:17] clear dude unironically child Dory n uh
[01:44:21] well not cookie who's the last character
[01:44:23] that I played in that team another
[01:44:24] dendro I think um like Co or some [ __ ]
[01:44:28] uh unironically is good for one rotation
[01:44:30] but then child goes on cool down if
[01:44:32] child had no cool down on his e that
[01:44:34] team is
[01:44:37] cracked Here Comes The Catch why sh
[01:44:41] hyper teams cuz I [ __ ] can it doesn't
[01:44:43] matter dude it literally does not matter
[01:44:47] like that's dude do people not
[01:44:50] understand that playing yolan and Nita
[01:44:52] in literally any team is GNA clear like
[01:44:55] it's that plus Kookie for free Hyper
[01:44:57] Bloom and then any character in the game
[01:45:01] and then it's like okay but you want
[01:45:02] investment for your yolan and stuff yeah
[01:45:03] true but you know how you get a good
[01:45:05] investment for your Nita by farming
[01:45:06] deepwood hm what do you get while you
[01:45:08] farm deepwood golden [ __ ] gilded dreams
[01:45:12] hm isn't that the set that hyper blooms
[01:45:15] so are you telling me you're going to
[01:45:16] get a Gita and at the same time you'll
[01:45:17] build your hyper character without even
[01:45:19] trying
[01:45:21] whoa that is crazy it's almost as if you
[01:45:24] don't actually need that much investment
[01:45:25] for hyper blo no that can't be
[01:45:36] true actually stun locked dude I wish I
[01:45:39] was [ __ ]
[01:45:41] [ __ ] I don't know I almost said [ __ ]
[01:45:43] locked but that would have just been
[01:45:44] clipped so I'm not going to say that
[01:45:45] what is this guy doing okay he's
[01:45:46] literally [ __ ] locking me let the mighty
[01:45:48] be
[01:45:49] humble no don't kill particles nice now
[01:45:53] I can kill
[01:45:56] him I have to say though to change the
[01:46:00] subject what the [ __ ] is nlet man what
[01:46:03] the [ __ ] is nlet he might be the only
[01:46:05] DPS I put on the same tier as support
[01:46:07] characters what the actual [ __ ] is nevet
[01:46:10] like actually it's not just his numbers
[01:46:13] his numbers are really high by the way
[01:46:14] but it's not just his numbers it's like
[01:46:16] he's so brain dead you literally can
[01:46:19] just solo every everything like what the
[01:46:21] [ __ ] is wrong with nevet like actually
[01:46:25] how is this Fair like genuinely how is
[01:46:27] it
[01:46:28] fair cuz I'm thinking of like like okay
[01:46:32] who do I recommend as a five star and
[01:46:33] it's almost always good supports and
[01:46:35] then DPSS you can pick the ones you like
[01:46:37] yeah characters like Alam are really
[01:46:39] good generally but like a lot of DPSS
[01:46:41] are really strong but I actually think
[01:46:43] nevet is like almost in the support tier
[01:46:45] like genuinely like if you ever are like
[01:46:47] I don't care which DPS I play just give
[01:46:49] me a good one you're probably pulling
[01:46:51] AET with me I think got hide them's a
[01:46:54] really good option too
[01:46:56] but out of my
[01:47:01] way are about to
[01:47:10] get he's also really fun I think he's
[01:47:12] fun but that's
[01:47:19] subjective
[01:47:21] I have no energy never mind I
[01:47:24] do how much crit rate does Kazo need
[01:47:26] with five sword uh a good thing with f
[01:47:29] sword is there's a chance to proc
[01:47:31] against like every time you hit
[01:47:32] something so every time you crit
[01:47:34] obviously but like there's a chance to
[01:47:35] crit the more hits you're doing and Kazo
[01:47:37] does multiple hits like when he sucks up
[01:47:39] goes down burst and especially against a
[01:47:41] lot of enemies where Kazo is good
[01:47:43] so you actually need less crit than
[01:47:46] other characters you can get away with
[01:47:48] less
[01:47:49] ideally like 30 to 50 20 is probably
[01:47:53] like the lowest I'd recommend 30 is like
[01:47:55] a good starting point 30 is fine 20 to
[01:47:58] 30 minimum I'd say yeah but what's nice
[01:48:00] about Kazo is you don't really need the
[01:48:03] only subset you need on your em pieces
[01:48:05] is ER so no you get that with fav yeah
[01:48:08] the only Subs you're looking for is crit
[01:48:09] and EM obviously cuz you get er from fav
[01:48:12] you might need a tad bit more depending
[01:48:14] on your team but outside of that your
[01:48:16] sand Goblin and ciret only need crit
[01:48:18] rate yeah 20 okay 20 might be too low if
[01:48:21] your refine is low I kind of forgot
[01:48:23] about low refine unrelatable I'm sorry
[01:48:25] yeah C would depend on your refine
[01:48:27] level but like that's like the low
[01:48:29] amount also I saw people I randomly saw
[01:48:32] people talking about how Skyward spine
[01:48:35] uh like how fav isn't like it's hard for
[01:48:38] Shena to make use of fav because she
[01:48:40] need crit rate listen here bucko okay a
[01:48:42] lot of Shena teams and by a lot I mean
[01:48:45] the only teams where you play Shena
[01:48:46] which are cryo characters have
[01:48:48] characters that are very energy hungry
[01:48:49] or need some Er like just a random
[01:48:52] example would be especially if you're
[01:48:53] using ki's burst something like this
[01:48:54] where all these characters can use the
[01:48:56] [ __ ] energy so yeah you can like
[01:48:58] scour spine your AKA uh your Shena or
[01:49:00] use another weapon and that's still fine
[01:49:02] but like fav is like really really
[01:49:03] really good here because you need the
[01:49:05] energy for a lot of characters not just
[01:49:06] chanha and the base attack is high for a
[01:49:08] four-star weapon
[01:49:10] anyways yeah you also get Crow residance
[01:49:13] CR rate true true that's actually I
[01:49:15] didn't even think about that true that's
[01:49:16] actually maybe you should be the guide
[01:49:18] maker chat true
[01:49:23] anyways okay let's keep going dude
[01:49:26] imagine chat makes a guide oh my God it
[01:49:29] would be terrible oh my God the [ __ ]
[01:49:31] society would collapse as we know it it
[01:49:34] would be
[01:49:40] over might actually be
[01:49:48] better you're funny Chad you're you're
[01:50:02] funny can you add hyper bat what the
[01:50:05] [ __ ] is hyper bat the
[01:50:17] be
[01:50:19] silence
[01:50:24] [ __ ] the might be hyper bad badest but
[01:50:27] hyper Bloom I kind of hate badess though
[01:50:30] why is my mon dead what the [ __ ]
[01:50:34] yo
[01:50:38] yo no you
[01:50:42] [ __ ] bow your head oh it's j bro it's
[01:50:49] j
[01:50:51] everyone
[01:50:52] in I miss my
[01:51:03] e here you
[01:51:14] are wow they just got hyper
[01:51:18] bloomed
[01:51:32] should I group them fine I'll group
[01:51:34] them is Jong Le still worth
[01:51:37] pulling I wholeheartedly believe that
[01:51:39] Jong Lee gives you so much comfort as a
[01:51:41] character while also being optimal in
[01:51:42] some teams that while typically he will
[01:51:44] be less DPS than kazell like 10 to 20%
[01:51:46] in certain teams maybe more maybe less
[01:51:48] uh and actually isn't going to be the
[01:51:49] most like TC well not TC but like the
[01:51:51] most like meta recommended option all
[01:51:53] the time he's very comfy can help a lot
[01:51:54] of people enjoy the game more and be
[01:51:56] optimal in some teams for characters
[01:51:57] that need a shield perhaps you're nevet
[01:51:59] perhaps you're Linny maybe sha in some
[01:52:00] teams so actually I think he's higher
[01:52:02] value than people give him credit for
[01:52:04] but not
[01:52:08] needed Shields do make you worse at the
[01:52:11] game though I agree like I I stopped
[01:52:13] learning to dodge when I was playing
[01:52:15] strong the all the
[01:52:18] time lightly burn
[01:52:22] the justice is blind like I was thinking
[01:52:25] about this yeah I'm going to stream
[01:52:27] Argent release tomorrow on na server
[01:52:28] Argent and haa I think I might start
[01:52:31] making star guys again when Ron May
[01:52:33] comes out Argent didn't look that
[01:52:34] interesting to me so I didn't want to
[01:52:35] like fully like look into his kit and
[01:52:37] like figure out how to make a guide but
[01:52:39] I might for the next
[01:52:43] character be
[01:52:46] humble
[01:52:48] INF
[01:52:51] it's because he's the Luke
[01:52:56] huh sorry the Temple of
[01:53:00] [Applause]
[01:53:02] wiard the process of elimination bond is
[01:53:05] strong whoa wait did they all just die
[01:53:08] cuz of our hyper blo huh sorry I'll shut
[01:53:10] up I don't know
[01:53:12] why your sacrifice is ready
[01:53:17] gotta I I missed the Char shot okay we

[01:53:34] part

[01:54:40] cancel dude am I the worst Alyan player
[01:54:43] what the [ __ ] is happening what the [ __ ]
[01:54:46] is happening I mean net the [ __ ] is
[01:54:48] happening right now bro I can't even
[01:54:50] play the game I hope no one's watching
[01:54:54] this
[01:54:57] hello what the [ __ ] is happening right
[01:54:59] now my of wait where the
[01:55:03] [ __ ] I'll read that in a second sorry
[01:55:06] trying not to skill issue
[01:55:09] uh okay what's up is it bad that I
[01:55:12] refresh my res every day uh I think if
[01:55:14] you do the 51 it's
[01:55:16] fine past that I don't recommend for
[01:55:18] casual gameplay but if you love and are
[01:55:19] addicted to artifacts like I am then you
[01:55:21] know do what makes you happy what I
[01:55:24] personally think is spending money on
[01:55:27] something that you enjoy and that you
[01:55:28] don't regret is okay whatever that is if
[01:55:32] you regret it feel forced to do it if
[01:55:33] you're like oh my God I can't clear the
[01:55:34] abyss unless I spend do 5 days so maybe
[01:55:37] do that before Bening genin takes like 1
[01:55:40] hour to speed what the [ __ ] is
[01:55:44] that wait huh no yo this is so good but
[01:55:50] I don't know if I want it to be all
[01:55:51] lowercase cuz this is like if you
[01:55:53] normally type sucros that's going to
[01:55:54] come up I don't know if I want
[01:55:58] that oh it's not
[01:56:01] loading oops I just leaked my entire
[01:56:03] history did I look anything up that sus
[01:56:06] there have been many po written
[01:56:08] applications lately thank God guess I'll
[01:56:10] just have to reject them
[01:56:16] all okay we'll try this emote out this
[01:56:18] eme's on trial period
[01:56:20] we might remove
[01:56:23] it why can't I see it I still can't see
[01:56:26] the emote in chat it's not working for
[01:56:41] me about to
[01:56:45] get what did I want to do oh never mind
[01:56:47] I was like I wanted to swap out of alam
[01:56:49] after he burst it I didn't know what
[01:56:50] ability to use so I panicked and stood
[01:56:52] there but it's fine I already cookied
[01:56:54] usually it's the
[01:56:57] cookie all right cool floor
[01:57:02] 12 okay before we start floor 12 I want
[01:57:05] to say nevertheless y requirs are very
[01:57:08] low on his signature by the way you
[01:57:09] really need a lot less you could get
[01:57:10] away with uh is it like 10 to 20 Z to 20
[01:57:14] maybe depending on your
[01:57:16] team uh I guess like 10 to 30 is
[01:57:18] generous but I don't think it's 30 but
[01:57:20] yeah it's a lot less say 10 to 20
[01:57:24] um I hate ER requirements though cuz
[01:57:26] they vary on so many things and like I
[01:57:27] feel bad if I tell you a number and then
[01:57:29] it's like for you it's more or less so
[01:57:33] yeah um okay there's something I want to
[01:57:36] talk about like this is not so I opened
[01:57:38] genin tier list maker and it was already
[01:57:40] filled without the font end characters
[01:57:42] from a previous stream I don't know why
[01:57:45] like I had something a tier called 200
[01:57:46] things to consider about Ula so don't
[01:57:48] take this seriously okay okay this was
[01:57:50] already here right except the Scara I
[01:57:51] just added this uh to please the Scara
[01:57:53] lovers in chat so just so they don't get
[01:57:55] mad at me cuz I love Scara anys we're
[01:57:57] not talking about this this doesn't
[01:57:58] matter this literally does not matter
[01:57:59] this does not matter this does not
[01:58:01] matter wow pogging this isn't like I I
[01:58:04] this isn't an actual Ser list but
[01:58:05] there's something I want to talk about
[01:58:06] and there's a reason why this is here so
[01:58:07] let's talk about it okay I was thinking
[01:58:10] about this cuz I was thinking like okay
[01:58:12] this isn't an actual tier list by the
[01:58:13] way like there's no characters here it
[01:58:15] doesn't matter but I was thinking okay
[01:58:18] let me make this more scy let's put um
[01:58:21] you we'll give Candace some love we
[01:58:23] haven't given Candace enough love there
[01:58:25] you go uh okay so
[01:58:29] look look um look this isn't an actual
[01:58:34] list right but I was thinking cuz I want
[01:58:37] to make a video that's like either top
[01:58:39] five or 10 but probably five uh uh uh or
[01:58:42] just like a general talking about
[01:58:44] characters that are the the best
[01:58:46] additions or most valuable additions to
[01:58:48] your account okay I think that's a good
[01:58:50] video for people that are like hm which
[01:58:51] five star should I pull five stars not
[01:58:52] four
[01:58:53] stars these aren't the characters by the
[01:58:55] way but I was thinking about it and I
[01:58:57] was thinking two things one every
[01:59:00] [ __ ] Hydro character would fill up
[01:59:01] like 90% of the video so I think well
[01:59:04] this guy got powercraft but in general
[01:59:06] right and the more I think about it the
[01:59:09] more I think they should all be in like
[01:59:11] the same category like Hydro character I
[01:59:14] think should be its own like character
[01:59:15] like every Hydro counts as one cuz like
[01:59:17] literally all of these can be used in so
[01:59:20] many [ __ ] teams and it's like the
[01:59:21] more you have the less you need but I
[01:59:24] don't know how to like cuz finina is a
[01:59:26] different pull value than like yolan
[01:59:28] who's a different pull value than Ki a
[01:59:29] different pull value than child but they
[01:59:30] all have high pull value based on what
[01:59:32] you need so it's kind of hard to like if
[01:59:34] I make it like a like a top X number is
[01:59:36] going to be like hydro hydro hydro hydro
[01:59:38] then the other stuff so it's like I
[01:59:40] don't know child's not flexible no but
[01:59:43] in the one team he's really good at he's
[01:59:45] really good at that [ __ ] team and
[01:59:47] that team is really [ __ ] good like
[01:59:48] child Shang Ling is so good that it
[01:59:50] justifies child as a character on like
[01:59:52] he's okay in like taser and [ __ ] but
[01:59:53] it's like child Shang Ling is like
[01:59:56] really really really
[01:59:59] good why is Candace and scarer I just
[02:00:02] sorry I don't
[02:00:05] know anyways
[02:00:09] um anyways uh and then the Kazo
[02:00:13] obviously but outside of that I think
[02:00:15] nevet is the first the more I thing
[02:00:17] about it I think nevet is the first DP
[02:00:19] character to be on par with like not on
[02:00:21] par but like to break the like never
[02:00:24] recommend a non-support character cuz I
[02:00:26] think nevet is like actually like alhy
[02:00:28] was the closest before look look what I
[02:00:30] wrote I wrote this like a year like a
[02:00:31] few patches ago this wasn't today DPS is
[02:00:34] but never as valuable as supports but
[02:00:35] this guy is close to that since he's
[02:00:37] very versatile and good teams and dendro
[02:00:39] is broken true and I still think this
[02:00:42] but I think nevet is even like
[02:00:46] closer
[02:00:48] um and then I think the like so my
[02:00:53] current question mark like I don't know
[02:00:55] if this is honorable mentions I don't
[02:00:56] know if this will be in it I don't know
[02:00:58] I haven't decided yet and this is what I
[02:01:00] need chat for I think Neu Ryden and Jong
[02:01:03] Lee and arguably venty but I don't think
[02:01:06] venty anymore because of the The Meta
[02:01:08] kind of [ __ ] him sideways but he's
[02:01:09] still good but anyways I think these
[02:01:11] three characters are like nice for
[02:01:15] certain things where they would be
[02:01:17] really nice
[02:01:19] if you can like okay especially like NE
[02:01:22] okay let me talk about this these three
[02:01:25] characters can be really [ __ ] nice to
[02:01:27] have but are also not needed for example
[02:01:30] NE Bloom feels really good in AOE has
[02:01:33] some really good budget friendly teams
[02:01:35] you can play you don't need n with uh
[02:01:36] Nita with her but you can be play with
[02:01:38] Nita like alham Cole there's so many
[02:01:40] [ __ ] like freet to-play accessible
[02:01:42] teams free-to-play teams outside of NE
[02:01:44] who's not fre play that are like really
[02:01:45] good that you can do Ryden amazing for
[02:01:48] like Ryden is like like the noob Tamer
[02:01:51] because she just gives you energy you
[02:01:53] can play National you can play uh hyper
[02:01:55] carry especially with C2 and you can
[02:01:56] play hyper Bloom one if you don't have
[02:01:58] Kookie or just as like a technically
[02:02:01] better Kookie but not a Healer in a lot
[02:02:03] of really good teams which kind of makes
[02:02:05] her in my opinion valuable but not like
[02:02:08] on the same level as the others uh but
[02:02:10] it depends like on your account she
[02:02:11] might be same with nuu and
[02:02:15] arguably well okay n is not the same but
[02:02:17] n is very like one is onedimensional the
[02:02:21] right word I think onedimensional exists
[02:02:22] for Neu cuz Neu is like really good but
[02:02:26] she only works one
[02:02:28] time like in one specific team and
[02:02:31] that's not a bad thing child also mostly
[02:02:33] Works in one team but like n's passive
[02:02:35] says hey if you're not playing Bloom
[02:02:37] [ __ ]
[02:02:40] you anyways ne's not in this but like
[02:02:43] this was just my like honorable mention
[02:02:45] part but like like I have to explain the
[02:02:47] like I don't have to explain Nita to you
[02:02:50] but like these three I kind of have to
[02:02:51] explain that's the only
[02:02:54] thing anyways Jeong Lee I
[02:02:57] think hear me out I think Jang Lee is
[02:03:01] better the less the more casual you are
[02:03:04] and the worse you are at dodging and the
[02:03:06] more you value comfort and if you're on
[02:03:07] your phone and if you're chilling but
[02:03:10] also if that was it I think he'd be cool
[02:03:13] for some people and bad for others but
[02:03:15] he also has teams where he's just the
[02:03:17] best option right like he just does like
[02:03:19] there's some teams where like you want a
[02:03:21] shield and in those teams J Le is
[02:03:23] usually the best not always like with
[02:03:26] like some like sometimes if you have
[02:03:27] milth on your farz on you could go like
[02:03:29] C6 Toma for Shia or you go like dea for
[02:03:31] some net teams even though de is usually
[02:03:33] copium but it works uh Linny if you want
[02:03:35] a shield instead of Shang Ling jangi is
[02:03:37] the best option like like the res tread
[02:03:39] and stuff like and Petra also in like a
[02:03:41] mono Pyro Team or with nette you can go
[02:03:43] Petra like there's situations where he's
[02:03:45] also meta but usually he's just comfort
[02:03:48] and I value that
[02:03:49] so I think that these three characters
[02:03:53] need to be mentioned in the discussion
[02:03:55] but I don't know exactly where they
[02:03:58] are I think
[02:04:00] finina is very POG incredibly POG but I
[02:04:04] don't but
[02:04:06] like I think similar things about a lot
[02:04:09] of the hydro characters I think a lot of
[02:04:10] the hydro characters are very
[02:04:16] POG ven is comfort therefore same tier I
[02:04:20] don't agree because ventti I think is
[02:04:23] like cool and sometimes if we ever get
[02:04:27] the old Abyss again venty will literally
[02:04:29] be the like the the first Abyss we got
[02:04:30] in the game venty will be immediately
[02:04:32] like the best unit but it's well maybe
[02:04:33] not but yeah but it's like now they kind
[02:04:36] of like [ __ ] venty so it's like
[02:04:39] sometimes he's like a life like some
[02:04:41] content is literally like venty destroys
[02:04:43] everything like yeah floor 9 to 11 sure
[02:04:46] [ __ ] N9 okay whoa not like for venty
[02:04:49] 911 this sounds worse than I should
[02:04:53] I I'm Middle Eastern I'm allowed to make
[02:04:55] that joke venty literally can can can
[02:04:58] carry floors 9 to 11 he can he just can
[02:05:00] he literally can but it's like then you
[02:05:02] get to floor 12 nothing moves you're
[02:05:04] like okay well why am I not playing
[02:05:05] sucros why am I not me
[02:05:07] kazua huh why you guys typing huh why
[02:05:10] you guys typing huh like no you don't
[02:05:12] why are you typing huh like my brother
[02:05:14] doesn't have to shave his beard before
[02:05:16] going to the airport or get racially
[02:05:17] profiled and stopped by TSA stop acting
[02:05:20] like I can't make that joke yes I can
[02:05:22] you're not sub [ __ ] suffering the
[02:05:24] consequences of it arguably I'm not
[02:05:26] either because I'm kind of spicy white
[02:05:28] but my family is so shut the [ __ ] up
[02:05:30] anyways we're going to keep talking
[02:05:32] about this we're going to keep talking
[02:05:33] about this we're g we're g we're gonna
[02:05:35] keep talking about this anyways
[02:05:39] uh I'm just kidding Chad but yeah he
[02:05:41] does carry Flores 9 101 and a lot of
[02:05:44] other
[02:05:46] content um
[02:05:51] but he kind of not falls off but falls
[02:05:55] off and because of that I don't know if
[02:05:58] I like I won't recommend him as highly
[02:06:00] like I don't think he's like worth
[02:06:03] getting for just I don't
[02:06:06] know I don't think like I don't
[02:06:07] recommend pulling him but like he's good
[02:06:09] to have and some people will get a lot
[02:06:11] of value out of
[02:06:13] him yeah for like for floor 12 you're
[02:06:16] just verd as in vener which isn't bad
[02:06:18] like like you're never going to get like
[02:06:20] he's never going to be useless I don't
[02:06:23] think he's ever going to be
[02:06:25] useless I'm going to I'm going to change
[02:06:27] the writing on this okay uh the like
[02:06:30] he's never going to be
[02:06:32] useless but it's
[02:06:34] like I don't know I don't know I think
[02:06:37] it's a bit different that's just me but
[02:06:38] I'm still thinking about it energy
[02:06:40] refund that's just for him though it's
[02:06:41] just like makes his energy uh cost less
[02:06:43] his burst like he doesn't need that much
[02:06:47] ER
[02:06:49] child and IO above NE Ryden is cope I
[02:06:51] don't think they're above it I think
[02:06:52] they're just in the hydro character tier
[02:06:54] I don't think AO is a better pull
[02:06:56] especially with nevet before nevet came
[02:06:58] out maybe but with nevet I don't think
[02:07:00] so anymore I'm just saying Hydro
[02:07:02] characters as a label AO might no longer
[02:07:05] be in there honestly uh child You can
[02:07:08] disagree with cuz changling but I
[02:07:09] actually think AO like kind of got
[02:07:11] [ __ ] by nevet he's literally just the
[02:07:13] worst nevet now outside of having more
[02:07:15] off field presence he has more off field
[02:07:18] presence but like usually he's just
[02:07:21] worse correct me if I'm
[02:07:25] wrong R vent's passive it's not just him
[02:07:27] oh my bad well energy then
[02:07:33] sure let me read it oh it's what the
[02:07:36] burst infuses okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:07:38] okay that makes
[02:07:40] sense that makes sense that makes
[02:07:43] sense yeah okay that makes sense true I
[02:07:46] forgot true but like yeah I mean that
[02:07:49] that's worth mentioning you're right but
[02:07:51] still my like the the point still stands
[02:07:53] that like he wherever ventti is good and
[02:07:55] like feels nice to use he's like one of
[02:07:58] the best if not the best characters like
[02:07:59] for sure but in some in most of like the
[02:08:03] difficult like content which is floor 12
[02:08:05] or bosses he'll just be a vescent
[02:08:07] venerous swirler and yeah also give you
[02:08:09] some energy which isn't like
[02:08:12] terrible it's always going to have an
[02:08:14] okay Baseline but it's like sometimes he
[02:08:17] feels like the best [ __ ] unit the
[02:08:18] game and other times he feels like a
[02:08:20] worst version of Kaza that's basically
[02:08:22] it so I think he's worth being mentioned
[02:08:25] but I don't think he's on the same level
[02:08:27] that's
[02:08:28] all that's
[02:08:35] all Bro think venty aim good his burst
[02:08:38] what dude what do you even know how to
[02:08:40] type what you just
[02:08:42] type literal God gets shafted by emo boy
[02:08:45] dude shut is Kazo even emo he lost his
[02:08:49] friend is he emo
[02:08:56] Dam not emo sexo why did you just resub
[02:09:01] and say
[02:09:07] sexo all right anemo emo tier list anemo
[02:09:11] emo tier
[02:09:14] list Shia wait who wins between Shia and
[02:09:16] Scara I actually I feel like Shia has
[02:09:19] more reason well I mean they both have
[02:09:20] reasons but Shia Loki like suffered for
[02:09:22] a million years
[02:09:25] Scara no but Scara like low key just
[02:09:28] needs a hug well that's not true but he
[02:09:30] needs like 10
[02:09:31] hugs Shia's emo scara's
[02:09:40] edgy trauma isn't a contest okay it's
[02:09:43] not about that it's not about how much
[02:09:44] they suffered it's about like how they
[02:09:46] show it like like okay how do I explain
[02:09:48] this it's about like their aesthetic
[02:09:49] like Shia aesthetically will attract
[02:09:51] more or
[02:09:53] less I guess it's not about who they
[02:09:55] attract it's about the vibe they give
[02:09:59] off dude every every anemo character has
[02:10:02] like a sad backstory except like isn't
[02:10:04] Gan just
[02:10:10] hardworking sa's

[02:53:51] also Fina very good potential with one
[02:53:56] stat we would like to avoid hopefully
[02:53:59] and arguably ER as well because we
[02:54:00] already have a good uh HP ER stat so
[02:54:02] hopefully getting crit would be uh not
[02:54:06] [ __ ] it Rhymes so it's
[02:54:13] true

[02:55:16] desires to exist W without needing
[02:55:20] anything okay to exist purely off one
[02:55:24] grain of rice and
[02:55:27] I am using this the techniques of our
[02:55:32] ancestors of people much smarter than I
[02:55:37] am I I admit it to roll this artifact
[02:55:41] and I don't care about it I don't care
[02:55:43] no reaction
[02:55:46] wow that's nice no reaction no reaction

[02:56:02] set I like it our current best one is
[02:56:05] holy [ __ ] look at this defense one
[02:56:07] anyways our HP one is either 13 crit
[02:56:09] rate which this one is better then uh
[02:56:12] because you also get more ER and 18 crit
[02:56:15] damage yeah it is better uh or this one
[02:56:18] which has 20 er um do I need the 20 ER
[02:56:21] I'm not sure let's look oh wait we

[03:34:53] it like I obviously it's like not like
[03:34:57] you know there's no need to exchange the
[03:34:59] most accurate it's rather pathetic to
[03:35:02] force a conversation just sucks which
[03:35:05] one's good though feel like it's the
[03:35:06] only one to do it's a waste of time yeah

[03:37:37] time disclaimer this one is over over
[03:37:40] used and apparently it'll like it'll
[03:37:42] probably just give us a generic result
[03:37:43] that shouldn't be taken seriously okay I
[03:37:45] know this I acknowledge this but we're
[03:37:47] doing it for fun agree everyone on the
[03:37:48] same page

[03:37:54] the [ __ ] you sent me a GitHub link who
[03:38:01] a wholesome
[03:38:04] values there's no need to exchange
[03:38:07] pleasantries it's rather pathetic to
[03:38:10] conversation just to occupy silence
[03:38:22] um wa which one should we do which one
[03:38:25] should we do how long is this one how
[03:38:27] long does it take wait it doesn't have
[03:38:29] any questions
[03:38:39] 60
[03:38:42] got it
[03:38:53] dude okay we're going to speed run this
[03:38:55] we'll do this but we have to speedrun it
[03:38:57] no stalling only content speedrun okay
[03:39:00] okay one has to prove they're worthy of
[03:39:02] my respect before they receive it no
[03:39:04] what the [ __ ] I think you should respect
[03:39:06] people I disagree wait that sentence
[03:39:09] actually angered me that dude dude [ __ ]
[03:39:12] okay that actually angered me I would
[03:39:13] like to keep a list of things that
[03:39:15] should disqualify others from
[03:39:16] interacting with me yo what the [ __ ] is
[03:39:20] this I
[03:39:21] mean like if you play Ula no no no no no
[03:39:24] I mean this is got to I
[03:39:27] mean interacting is Harsh like there's
[03:39:30] there's things that people do that's
[03:39:31] like weird or like not nice but like
[03:39:33] interacting is Harsh of a term I don't
[03:39:36] really like that term uh disagree I
[03:39:39] guess yeah it sounds like arrogant like
[03:39:41] like you're like Better Than People yeah
[03:39:43] I disagree uh most likely just give a
[03:39:46] warm welcome to people just entering a
[03:39:48] community that I'm established in oh
[03:39:50] yeah of course no Gatekeepers I first
[03:39:53] judge a person based off outwardly
[03:39:55] observable characteristics deter if I
[03:39:57] should act positively or
[03:40:00] negatively I think you should TR like
[03:40:03] what the [ __ ] is this you say run to new
[03:40:05] Chatters okay but that's different
[03:40:07] that's not [ __ ] you okay
[03:40:11] uh I mean you kind of have to like not
[03:40:13] you have to but like I feel like you
[03:40:15] inherently
[03:40:17] like at least I feel like it's
[03:40:22] like I want to be positive to people but
[03:40:25] like you kind of inherently get a
[03:40:27] judgment of someone based on how they
[03:40:29] act is that not what this means I mean
[03:40:32] it's characteristic I don't like this
[03:40:33] question I feel like you're like
[03:40:35] inherently yeah I feel like you're
[03:40:36] inherently like not biased but like
[03:40:39] influenced by whatever your first
[03:40:40] Judgment of them
[03:40:42] is I don't
[03:40:45] know I don't think it should determine
[03:40:47] if I'm positive or negative towards them
[03:40:48] though ideally but I don't know if
[03:40:50] that's I don't know if it affects me
[03:40:51] like I can't tell if I'm like answering
[03:40:54] with how I would want to act or how I
[03:40:56] actually act like I would like to think
[03:40:58] that I act positively to people but
[03:41:00] obviously if the first thing I see is
[03:41:01] you being an [ __ ] I'm not going to be
[03:41:02] nice to you like if you're an ass I'm
[03:41:04] not going to like like I won't be mean
[03:41:05] but like like dude like what the [ __ ]
[03:41:07] are you doing I don't know I don't
[03:41:08] really like this question uh
[03:41:10] um I mean slightly agree I guess
[03:41:13] whatever I am joined when newcomers
[03:41:15] attempt to join and be a part of my own
[03:41:16] space yeah yeah join my community yeah
[03:41:21] yeah I want to show equal levels of
[03:41:23] respect to those who I first meet
[03:41:25] instead of discriminating based on perer
[03:41:27] okay chat listen you guys are having
[03:41:29] fake right listen I tell you guys to run
[03:41:31] for your own safety but if you're
[03:41:32] willing to accept the risks of of
[03:41:34] whatever this stream is then you are
[03:41:36] welcome by all
[03:41:39] means
[03:41:41] I want to show equal levels of respect
[03:41:42] to those who I first
[03:41:48] meet
[03:41:53] yeah what does this mean discrimin based
[03:41:56] on personal preferences but if I didn't
[03:41:57] meet them before what would the personal
[03:41:59] preferences be if it's first meet what
[03:42:01] would the preferences like what I heard
[03:42:02] I don't know I mean
[03:42:07] agree I want to cry
[03:42:10] we'll do I want to
[03:42:12] do we'll do agree I mean I guess like
[03:42:16] why would I be mean to someone yeah yeah
[03:42:18] I agree for
[03:42:19] sure I hold grudges for long no I don't
[03:42:21] hold grudges I don't I actually am the
[03:42:24] least grudging grudging I do not I hate
[03:42:27] [ __ ] dude [ __ ] can't
[03:42:29] get over something that happened 10
[03:42:30] years ago that like wasn't even a big
[03:42:32] deal grow the [ __ ] up sorry it depends
[03:42:35] there's levels sometimes you know but I
[03:42:37] don't really hold grudges I forget a lot
[03:42:40] I forget a lot and I think people can
[03:42:42] change so I don't hold Goods an eye for
[03:42:45] eye tooth for tooth
[03:42:48] um false I am sorry for whatever someone
[03:42:52] did to you okay some people are [ __ ]
[03:42:53] and don't deserve forgiveness but a lot
[03:42:55] of people do it
[03:42:58] depends uh in my opinion I don't know
[03:43:01] I'm like what do I know I tooth for
[03:43:04] tooth uh no I don't think so doesn't
[03:43:08] that make the world go blind
[03:43:10] is that the saying I for I makes the
[03:43:12] world go
[03:43:13] blind I mean sometimes I
[03:43:16] guess it's
[03:43:20] unch let something go when I feel that a
[03:43:22] person has previously wronged me no I
[03:43:24] let things
[03:43:25] go I do but I like to talk about it like
[03:43:28] I'm not going to like Let It Go for no
[03:43:30] reason but like if we're cool we're
[03:43:36] cool I don't know un characteris I mean
[03:43:39] I
[03:43:45] like no I don't think that's me I'll
[03:43:47] disagree I believe good prevails over
[03:43:49] evil in the end what the [ __ ] is yo what
[03:43:52] I mean yeah I think so I like the hope
[03:43:55] so what the
[03:43:57] [ __ ] I
[03:44:00] agree I mean
[03:44:02] like I don't know does it does
[03:44:07] it I mean you study law and you think
[03:44:10] that's true okay I like how do I say
[03:44:13] this
[03:44:18] I I am very
[03:44:21] optimistic but I also believe society's
[03:44:24] [ __ ] like I think like you know
[03:44:27] [ __ ] Justice systems [ __ ] a lot of
[03:44:29] [ __ ] is [ __ ] the [ __ ] whole economy
[03:44:31] system is you work you're a cog in the
[03:44:33] machine you try to make more money and
[03:44:34] then you're a better person than the
[03:44:35] other person for some [ __ ] reason
[03:44:37] like I don't like all that stuff so I
[03:44:39] think like there's a lot lot of like
[03:44:40] [ __ ] up stuff in the world but I'm
[03:44:42] very optim I'm a very positive I try to
[03:44:44] be a positive person I try to think
[03:44:46] positive or I get too depressed like I
[03:44:47] try to be very like I don't know I don't
[03:44:50] know like I hope
[03:44:52] so I hope so I don't [ __ ]
[03:44:58] know I'm gonna do like neutral no but
[03:45:02] that's a bad that's a [ __ ] answer I
[03:45:03] can't do
[03:45:04] neutral
[03:45:08] uh evil fails people are
[03:45:11] dumb dude I mean
[03:45:17] like yeah maybe it's like a
[03:45:21] SL I don't get biased by chat though
[03:45:23] what do I
[03:45:30] think Evil's already
[03:45:33] prevailing like the more I think about
[03:45:36] it logically the more I want to disagree
[03:45:37] but in my heart I agree does that make
[03:45:39] sense
[03:45:41] sense like in my heart I agree but like
[03:45:44] every time I hear something or see
[03:45:46] something I like it makes me want to
[03:45:53] disagree so I'm going to do slightly
[03:45:55] disagree because I don't know when
[03:45:57] envisioning possibilities of what could
[03:45:58] happen I often grasp on to the better or
[03:46:00] best outcomes no I'm I I
[03:46:05] ah no I'm kind of a Doomer like I'm like
[03:46:08] positive but like I expect the worst a
[03:46:11] lot because historically in my life it
[03:46:14] has been the no like I don't know at
[03:46:16] least artifact farming not to make that
[03:46:18] about my life but we' we've rolled it's
[03:46:21] h yeah yeah that's a that's a disagree
[03:46:24] that's a
[03:46:25] disagree people can be trusted to do the
[03:46:27] right thing most of the
[03:46:29] time what is the right thing I think
[03:46:32] people can be trusted to do uh uh to act
[03:46:36] in their best interest but very
[03:46:38] selfishly I think most most people do
[03:46:40] what's best for them and the people very
[03:46:42] close around them but not the right
[03:46:44] thing like I think uh morally it won't
[03:46:47] be the right thing I think a lot of
[03:46:49] people that
[03:46:50] like end up like doing bad [ __ ] it's
[03:46:53] like they're trying to do something for
[03:46:55] themselves and then it like spiraled so
[03:46:57] I don't think so I disagree when we live
[03:47:00] in a cold harsh world we have to accept
[03:47:02] this reality okay this is yo I'm not
[03:47:05] that much of a Doomer like I get it okay
[03:47:07] A lot of people are [ __ ] we're we're
[03:47:09] [ __ ] listen I can't even I have to
[03:47:12] [ __ ] look there's a lot of [ __ ] up
[03:47:13] [ __ ] I have to cancel there's a lot of
[03:47:16] listen I this is too why is it asking me
[03:47:20] this not cold
[03:47:24] anymore
[03:47:31] um I don't think so I think there's a
[03:47:33] lot of a lot of good but there's also a
[03:47:36] lot of
[03:47:38] bad like it's
[03:47:40] true you
[03:47:43] know
[03:47:45] but I don't like to view it like that so
[03:47:48] I'm going to slightly disagree looking
[03:47:50] at the state of things those who believe
[03:47:52] people are good at heart must be
[03:47:53] blissfully ignorant dude what who wrote
[03:47:55] this this guy yo who wrote this what the
[03:48:04] hell this is depressing I don't think so
[03:48:07] I think um
[03:48:10] I don't think so I think a lot of this
[03:48:12] comes from your like experiences but you
[03:48:15] answer like a Shia wood I also think
[03:48:18] okay but this is my like I also believe
[03:48:20] that most people are inherently good but
[03:48:22] like a lot of people become bad people
[03:48:24] because of like their like upbringing or
[03:48:26] like not like upbringing necessarily but
[03:48:28] like people around them like if your
[03:48:29] family is like how do I say if your
[03:48:31] family or like your like [ __ ] not to
[03:48:33] be
[03:48:34] like political Andy but like if your
[03:48:36] family or like government or like people
[03:48:39] you look look up to or whatever like
[03:48:41] teach you things in a certain way you're
[03:48:43] probably going to grow up believing
[03:48:44] those things like you could be a bad
[03:48:46] person kind of just like because of a
[03:48:49] bad like obviously it's your fault but
[03:48:51] like I don't know I don't know dude why
[03:48:53] is this quiz so
[03:48:54] Doomer I disagree we're speedr running
[03:48:57] even in times when people are mad
[03:48:59] another who has made a big mistake I
[03:49:00] believe the in the power to correct and
[03:49:02] improve yes I agree we should not make
[03:49:04] people suffer for what is in the past
[03:49:06] because it's unnecessary ah it depends I
[03:49:08] mean what did you
[03:49:10] do did you pee in my soup that you
[03:49:13] should suffer a little not like a lot
[03:49:15] but like you know like maybe like you
[03:49:17] know I'll pee in your soup what the [ __ ]
[03:49:20] like a bit I like it's not unnecessary
[03:49:23] but like I I believe in like I don't
[03:49:25] think people should suffer I don't know
[03:49:28] what are these
[03:49:35] questions I for an ey like I don't I
[03:49:38] don't believe in I for an ey like I
[03:49:40] think it's like it depends like I
[03:49:43] believe more in
[03:49:44] like you know forgiveness and
[03:49:46] Rehabilitation but like sometimes it's
[03:49:49] not like you know everything is Forgiven
[03:49:51] I'm going to I'm going to slightly
[03:49:53] disagree we should not always focus on
[03:49:55] Improvement wa I don't even remember if
[03:49:56] disagree or agrees what I meant whatever
[03:49:58] we should always focus on Improvement
[03:49:59] not punishment H not I mean mostly not
[03:50:02] always but mostly I think improving is
[03:50:04] better positive
[03:50:06] reinforcement it's more likely to see
[03:50:08] how someone could something could wrong
[03:50:11] rather than its potential upsides this
[03:50:12] isn't even
[03:50:14] [Music]
[03:50:18] English you regularly make new friends
[03:50:21] yeah I do you spend a lot of time
[03:50:22] exploring various random topics that
[03:50:24] peque your interest I actually do uh
[03:50:27] yeah I do seeing other people cry easily
[03:50:29] can make you feel like you want to cry
[03:50:31] no not really uh you have to make a
[03:50:33] backup plan for a backup plan do
[03:50:38] I yeah yeah uh I don't like I'm not like
[03:50:42] an
[03:50:44] overthinker you make a backup plan for a
[03:50:46] backup
[03:50:49] plan okay guys we're gonna guys we're
[03:50:52] going to go we're going to hit B and
[03:50:54] then if the B hit fails we lose okay I
[03:50:56] don't yeah I don't I'll do a slight
[03:50:58] disagree you'll usually stay calm even
[03:51:00] under a lot of
[03:51:01] pressure Chad do I stay calm press one
[03:51:04] if I stay
[03:51:06] calm no I don't I actually don't like I
[03:51:08] don't get like
[03:51:09] yeah I sometimes get overloaded but like
[03:51:12] I I actually I noticed one of my biggest
[03:51:15] faults is I need to I noticed I act a
[03:51:17] lot more rationally if when a lot of
[03:51:19] things go wrong I just like give it five
[03:51:22] minutes and then react cuz sometimes
[03:51:24] like I'll like respond to something not
[03:51:26] like respond but like react to something
[03:51:28] that and it's like it's never the right
[03:51:30] choice until I chill so I'm going to
[03:51:32] disagree on this you so EV you rarely
[03:51:35] try to introduce your to new people uh
[03:51:36] that's not true slight disagree I
[03:51:38] introduced myself kind kind of somewhat
[03:51:40] not really I kind of sit in the corner
[03:51:42] but I introduce myself sometimes you r a
[03:51:43] complete finish one the lot
[03:51:47] guide I also have a Yen fake guide uh
[03:51:50] that I recorded that I never uploaded as
[03:51:51] well as probably 17 other videos I had a
[03:51:53] resin spending video in Star rail a dad
[03:51:56] hung guide fully edited with a thumbnail
[03:51:58] uh quite a few others too yeah anyways
[03:52:00] you're are very
[03:52:02] sentimental
[03:52:05] sentimental Senti from hongye Impact
[03:52:10] uh am I
[03:52:14] sentimental not really like a
[03:52:17] little emotions are I I don't know am I
[03:52:20] I play
[03:52:24] Shia
[03:52:27] dude I don't think I'm very s I'm like a
[03:52:29] little sentimental but not really you
[03:52:31] like to use organizing tools yes yes oh
[03:52:34] my I literally have a notepad right
[03:52:38] now I literally have notepads of
[03:52:40] everything I'm going to
[03:52:42] do even a small mistake can cause you to
[03:52:45] doubt your overall abilities and
[03:52:48] knowledge yeah yeah that happens I get
[03:52:51] that quite a bit you feel comfortable
[03:52:53] just walking up to someone and you find
[03:52:54] interesting yeah I gasted myself into
[03:52:56] into being able to do this because I was
[03:52:58] like why the [ __ ] wouldn't I so I've
[03:52:59] gotten better at this you are not
[03:53:01] interested in discussing various
[03:53:03] interpretations and Analysis of creative
[03:53:05] Works yes I
[03:53:07] am you are more inclined to follow your
[03:53:10] heart than your head no [ __ ] your head
[03:53:12] than your heart what you are more
[03:53:13] inclined to follow your head than your
[03:53:15] heart
[03:53:16] TR true A wise man once said follow your
[03:53:20] head for small decisions and your heart
[03:53:22] for big ones true l
[03:53:26] w yes I think I
[03:53:29] am usually prefer doing what you like at
[03:53:32] any given moment instead of planning a
[03:53:34] particular daily routine yes but I plan
[03:53:38] a routine and then I don't follow it l w
[03:53:41] so maybe a small one you rarely worry
[03:53:43] about whether you make a good
[03:53:45] impression um I think when I took this
[03:53:48] like two years ago I explained how this
[03:53:49] got [ __ ] by me now being a content
[03:53:51] creator cuz usually I don't care too
[03:53:53] much but now I noticed that if I say
[03:53:55] something people are going to like let's
[03:53:56] say I meet someone they're going to
[03:53:57] remember that one 10-second or like 30
[03:54:00] second interaction for a lot longer than
[03:54:02] I will and so if I had a bad day or if I
[03:54:04] said something that I don't mean or if I
[03:54:05] was mean or if I was like just like
[03:54:07] anything then it's definitely a lot more
[03:54:09] like it's a lot like I wouldn't want
[03:54:11] that so I definitely
[03:54:13] care like I try not to make like I try
[03:54:17] not to act in a way that I wouldn't
[03:54:20] want to act that's the most pepega
[03:54:23] sentence I've ever said but I do worry
[03:54:25] about it quite a
[03:54:26] bit I mean to a certain extent like I
[03:54:29] don't obsess over it but you enjoy
[03:54:31] participating in group
[03:54:32] activities [ __ ] no I mean yeah I
[03:54:36] do if it's like for fun like I'll five
[03:54:39] sack with the
[03:54:40] homies wait was I supposed to disagree
[03:54:42] you rarely worry oh oops yeah you're
[03:54:45] right
[03:54:47] um sometimes I'm a bit anti social but
[03:54:51] uh for the most part I mean I kind of do
[03:54:53] I'm pretty indifferent like I like it I
[03:54:55] don't I don't really care but I like
[03:54:57] being with friends I usually okay I
[03:54:59] usually this is my the state of my exor
[03:55:02] and what the [ __ ] is it called n what's
[03:55:04] the E
[03:55:05] and extroverted versus introvertedness I
[03:55:09] always have fun when I go out like with
[03:55:11] friends or people meeting people like I
[03:55:12] usually always have fun but I don't want
[03:55:15] to do it initially I just like rather
[03:55:16] stay home but like every time I do it I
[03:55:18] have fun so like yeah I usually do enjoy
[03:55:20] you like books and movies that make you
[03:55:21] come up with your own
[03:55:23] interpretation yeah yeah for the most
[03:55:27] part although it kind of tilts me when
[03:55:29] it's like the author's like oh you can
[03:55:31] choose [ __ ] you what do you think you
[03:55:34] wrote the damn book you made the damn
[03:55:37] characters sorry
[03:55:39] but
[03:55:48] like I don't
[03:55:51] know I mean Okay no Okay minimal
[03:55:54] spoilers only right now when I finished
[03:55:58] code guas I I it's been a while it was
[03:56:00] like the second anime I watched like
[03:56:01] years ago so it's been a while I
[03:56:03] remember like being like oh [ __ ] like
[03:56:05] you know that's cool and then they like
[03:56:07] release a movie and I'm like what the
[03:56:08] [ __ ] doesn't this ruin the ending and
[03:56:09] then I haven't watched a movie so I
[03:56:10] don't know but yeah
[03:56:12] anyways anyways
[03:56:16] um so I'm going to just slight
[03:56:19] disagree movies non- Cannon oh I see
[03:56:23] your happiness comes from helping others
[03:56:24] accomplish things than your own
[03:56:27] accomplishments uh I wish it did it
[03:56:30] doesn't but I do like helping people
[03:56:31] accomplish things it makes me happy it
[03:56:33] makes me warm inside but I definitely
[03:56:35] get uh I definitely am very
[03:56:39] uh uh
[03:56:40] uh uh self
[03:56:43] fulfillment like I like helping others
[03:56:45] but I that's not like where my happiness
[03:56:47] comes
[03:56:48] from maybe
[03:56:51] this well it's not more that's the
[03:56:55] thing yeah it's not
[03:56:57] more it's like also you're interested in
[03:57:00] so many things that you find it
[03:57:01] difficult yep you are prone to worrying
[03:57:03] that things will take a turn for the
[03:57:05] worse
[03:57:07] um I
[03:57:09] I'm not like that I know people that
[03:57:10] always like are worried that like shit's
[03:57:12] going to [ __ ] up and like that's sad and
[03:57:14] a lot of times it's like because not to
[03:57:17] be a [ __ ] you know diagnosing Daryl
[03:57:21] but like a lot of times I feel like it's
[03:57:23] like people will wrong you or [ __ ] will
[03:57:25] go wrong and then it's like you kind of
[03:57:27] expect it to happen again which isn't
[03:57:28] your fault and that that sucks and I try
[03:57:30] not to like think like
[03:57:32] that but I mean I'm getting I'm trying
[03:57:36] to finish my law degree cuz I don't
[03:57:37] think this is going to last so uh a
[03:57:39] little bit like a little but like I'm
[03:57:41] not prone to it you avoid leadership uh
[03:57:43] not really you're definitely not an
[03:57:45] artistic type of
[03:57:47] person hey I can whip a nice little draw
[03:57:50] look look who am I drawing who am I
[03:57:51] drawing who am I drawing who am I
[03:57:52] drawing you guys already know I don't
[03:57:54] even have to finish it look at
[03:57:55] this J spear J spear boom lament rubber
[03:58:00] cement yep yes sir yes sir yes
[03:58:07] sir
[03:58:12] uh I'm not really art like I like like
[03:58:15] music and like I like consuming Arts but
[03:58:17] I'm not I mean I've played a lot of
[03:58:19] music I don't know if that counts like I
[03:58:21] played like piano guitar I like three
[03:58:23] two guitars well my brother's guitars i
[03:58:24] y
[03:58:26] them uh I mean I'm like I'm not like
[03:58:29] very artistic but you have yeah I play
[03:58:33] aim Labs with a
[03:58:36] metronome play the piano dude I play
[03:58:38] like s years of piano I can't remember
[03:58:39] [ __ ] I was a kid like I'm sure I could
[03:58:41] get back into it but it's been so long
[03:58:43] so I don't
[03:58:45] know like a little like slightly
[03:58:54] artistic yeah you think the world would
[03:58:57] be better if people relied more
[03:58:59] rationality than less on their feelings
[03:59:01] is it toxic if I say
[03:59:05] yes yeah I mean this is very Shain to be
[03:59:08] like yeah [ __ ] feelings but like like I
[03:59:13] think it's I have matured recently and I
[03:59:15] think it's bad to just dismiss feelings
[03:59:17] and stuff and like you have to come to
[03:59:18] terms with them I have matured but I
[03:59:20] also am very rational and I don't like
[03:59:23] feelings you PR to do your chor the FR
[03:59:26] nope you enjoy watching people argue
[03:59:29] okay yes but in a not mean way like I
[03:59:31] like arguing I'm in [ __ ] dude I study
[03:59:33] law well I used to aware but like I like
[03:59:36] that arguments are cool I like that that
[03:59:38] but like as long as they're not too
[03:59:39] heated like if you're not having a gamer
[03:59:41] Moment Like if it's not like a [ __ ]
[03:59:43] Twitter thread and you're just like C
[03:59:44] like you know like like respectfully
[03:59:46] arguing I like
[03:59:50] that you said to avoid drawing attention
[03:59:52] to yourself
[03:59:54] um well uh I kind of do
[04:00:01] like I should probably Auto Battle Star
[04:00:04] while I do this
[04:00:06] but no everyone's saying no
[04:00:09] okay yeah okay you're right yeah okay
[04:00:12] you're right let's big disagree your
[04:00:14] mood can change well small disagree I'm
[04:00:16] not like the people like some people
[04:00:17] talk in capto some people talk in capto
[04:00:19] I disagree like like that's not me like
[04:00:21] there's nothing I I love professional
[04:00:23] yappers don't get me wrong they make
[04:00:25] introverted people feel comfortable okay
[04:00:26] but I'm like a bit I'm not like a
[04:00:28] professional yapper I'm a little bit I'm
[04:00:30] a little bit under you m yep which is a
[04:00:32] flaw of mine I I'm very Snappy which I
[04:00:35] don't like this this runs in my family
[04:00:38] we get we we are we we mood change fast
[04:00:41] but not for long like I might get upset
[04:00:43] fast but then I don't I like 5 minutes
[04:00:45] later I'm chilling you lose patience
[04:00:47] with people who are not as efficient as
[04:00:48] you uh I don't think so do
[04:00:52] I feel like this is a j no no but I
[04:00:55] don't think I
[04:00:57] do I mean no I definitely don't it's a
[04:01:01] Leo
[04:01:03] thing you finish others sentences [ __ ]
[04:01:06] but I mean it's not in a mean way
[04:01:09] sometimes they like struggling on a word
[04:01:11] I'm like oh do you mean this like I I
[04:01:12] try dude I'm not like me like mad I'm
[04:01:17] not like losing patience I am impatient
[04:01:19] but it's not like if I know someone's
[04:01:21] trying I'm not going to be like mad at
[04:01:22] them for not like I okay here's an
[04:01:25] example here's the best example when I
[04:01:26] play like a team like let's say I'm
[04:01:28] playing valerant okay I don't flame
[04:01:29] people that are bad I'm not going to be
[04:01:30] like like I'll like say like to my to my
[04:01:33] friends or to like to you guys but I
[04:01:35] won't be mean to them the only people I
[04:01:37] will Flame is if someone's being mean to
[04:01:39] like my friends or me like if someone's
[04:01:41] like being an [ __ ] it's like okay
[04:01:42] [ __ ] you like I'm not going to Flame
[04:01:44] someone to not because they're not
[04:01:45] good I mean I will but not to them does
[04:01:48] that make sense like I I'll say it to
[04:01:49] you guys I don't know I don't think I do
[04:01:52] but maybe you have to end up doing
[04:01:54] things at the last yep you often have
[04:01:56] been fascinated by the question of what
[04:01:57] if anything happens after death um I
[04:02:00] mean kind of but I also too stupid to
[04:02:03] know so why I don't know I don't know
[04:02:06] kind of not really maybe kind of usually
[04:02:09] prefer to be around others rather than
[04:02:10] your
[04:02:13] own
[04:02:15] no I love being around others but I also
[04:02:18] love being alone you become bored or
[04:02:19] lose interest when the discussion gets
[04:02:20] highly theoretical no you find it easy
[04:02:23] to empathize when a person whose
[04:02:24] experience is very different than
[04:02:26] yours I don't think so um I'm not like
[04:02:30] the best empathizer but I try like I try
[04:02:33] and I I I don't find it like
[04:02:37] hard
[04:02:39] find it easy to empathize a person who
[04:02:41] kind of a
[04:02:43] little how are we only 50 dude I'm speed
[04:02:46] running usually postpone finalizing yeah
[04:02:48] [ __ ] me dude I literally book flights at
[04:02:51] the last minute and then get [ __ ] by
[04:02:53] Air Canada fat [ __ ] every time cuz I
[04:02:55] wait till the last day I am so bad I am
[04:02:58] so bad at postponing [ __ ] and I I I
[04:03:01] don't learn you early second guess the
[04:03:03] choices you made
[04:03:04] um usually when I make a decision I
[04:03:07] don't go back on it but I do I second
[04:03:10] guess I don't even I have no memory I
[04:03:12] actually am concerned about like
[04:03:14] genuinely I think I have some memory
[04:03:16] problem because I can't remember half
[04:03:17] the [ __ ] I do in life but um I don't
[04:03:20] really second guess too much after a
[04:03:23] long and exhausting week a lively social
[04:03:25] event is what you
[04:03:29] need okay a little bit I I
[04:03:33] sometimes ah I'm literally second
[04:03:35] guessing this right now I second guess a
[04:03:37] lot for like the same like for a little
[04:03:39] bit and then I never think about it
[04:03:40] again I don't know what that counts like
[04:03:43] for example I
[04:03:44] like when I'm talking about like let's
[04:03:46] say I'm talking about like what I think
[04:03:47] about a character I'll like rephrase it
[04:03:49] eight different times but then after
[04:03:51] I'll just never think about it again so
[04:03:53] I I mean I do second guess but like I
[04:03:56] also don't I don't know where that leads
[04:04:01] me I'll put out like slightly disagree
[04:04:06] after the longest L week a lot of the
[04:04:07] social events what you need
[04:04:08] yes but also I need to just be a [ __ ]
[04:04:10] alone for a little bit I need time to
[04:04:12] just [ __ ] play against an impact so
[04:04:14] I'm going to neutral I hate neutral

[04:04:17] slight disagree you enjoy going to Art
[04:04:19] Museums yeah I mean it's okay you also

[04:04:36] one I I know half the things should just
[04:04:38] be a text but I like talking to people

[04:07:33] time I mean
[04:07:36] yeah kind of

[04:07:40] philosophical questions is a waste of
[04:07:41] time no you feel more drawn to places

[04:07:46] bustling busing atmospheres than quiet
[04:07:49] intimate places

[04:11:20] over
[04:11:22] any if I could skip these questions I
[04:11:24] would you're very intrigued by labeled
[04:11:27] things labeled as controversial am I a
[04:11:29] drama farmer chat be honest am I a drama
[04:11:32] farmer chat be honest am I a drama
[04:11:34] farmer chat be honest am I a drama

[04:11:45] I intrigued by it do I look at it in my
[04:11:48] off
[04:11:49] time I I think I do but I do to learn
[04:11:52] like I guess that makes me intrigued by
[04:11:54] it like I don't like drama farming but I
[04:11:56] like to look at like I like to watch
[04:11:57] like Mogul Ma and [ __ ] just to know like
[04:12:00] I like to be up to date on things and to
[04:12:02] know what not to do like I try to be the
[04:12:05] okay this is going to sound very cringe
[04:12:07] but I try to be the best me okay I try I
[04:12:09] feel like sometimes I try to act like
[04:12:13] not the person I am but the person I
[04:12:15] want to be until I am that person cuz I
[04:12:17] feel like I'm not like I feel like I
[04:12:19] have a long way to go so I want to be
[04:12:21] better but it's like I need to learn
[04:12:24] from people that are better and from
[04:12:25] people that are dumb asses to avoid what
[04:12:27] the [ __ ] they're
[04:12:28] doing so I'm going to like slight agree
[04:12:31] on
[04:12:34] this but I don't want to be involved in
[04:12:36] drama cuz like why like I don't want to
[04:12:38] be that person even though it would like
[04:12:40] Farm views easily I don't like that it's
[04:12:41] like weird I don't know it's not weird I
[04:12:43] mean you know to each their own like I
[04:12:45] don't like you can dark mode this how
[04:12:47] how do you dark mode this
[04:12:53] anyways so you're delusional about
[04:12:55] yourself I mean it's not even that it's
[04:12:57] okay here's the thing I feel like
[04:13:00] randomly okay I feel like I locked out
[04:13:03] and have a platform but I don't view
[04:13:06] myself Worthy of the platform unless I
[04:13:08] am the person that I would like to be I
[04:13:10] feel like at a baseline like obviously
[04:13:12] I'm it doesn't matter this doesn't
[04:13:14] matter okay it's I'm irrelevant but like
[04:13:16] I feel
[04:13:18] like I don't want people to look up to
[04:13:21] me if I don't think I'm a good person
[04:13:23] like I think I'm a good person but I
[04:13:24] don't think I'm like I don't know I
[04:13:26] don't know you I feel like I have a lot
[04:13:28] to learn uh you would pass along a good
[04:13:31] opportunity if you thought someone else
[04:13:32] needed it
[04:13:33] more depends depends depends maybe
[04:13:38] I have I mean I have done this but it's
[04:13:40] never been like a huge deal if it's like
[04:13:43] but I guess if they need well it dep
[04:13:45] like
[04:13:58] if yeah it depends I feel like if I
[04:14:03] don't really need it and someone really
[04:14:04] needs it I would for sure but if I
[04:14:07] really need it and someone else really
[04:14:08] needs it but like a little more I
[04:14:09] wouldn't unless they're like my friend
[04:14:11] or like family or something but if it's
[04:14:13] like someone I don't know and I also
[04:14:16] really need it I wouldn't like it just
[04:14:18] depends if it's like zag
[04:14:22] yeah I'm going to slight disagree I'm
[04:14:24] actually
[04:14:26] GNA yeah I'm going to slight disagree

[04:16:23] this I'm not a
[04:16:25] contrarian the betas are known for the
[04:16:27] rebellious stake for the streak for this
[04:16:30] personal typ no belief is too sacred to
[04:16:32] be questioned no idea is too
[04:16:35] fundamentalization hey what if hyper
[04:16:37] Bloom isn't that
[04:16:41] good disagree uh cost of
[04:16:44] contrarianism think they're champions of
[04:16:47] rationality and Logic the
[04:16:50] [ __ ] strk and weaknesses knowledge all
[04:16:54] right y knowledgeable quick thinkers
[04:16:59] original excellent
[04:17:02] brainstormers charismatic
[04:17:05] energetic
[04:17:09] all right weaknesses we can skip this
[04:17:10] yep yep very argumentative true
[04:17:14] insensitive whoa whoa whoa whoa I'm
[04:17:16] sensitive what the hell intolerant
[04:17:20] unless people are able to back up their
[04:17:21] ideas in a round of mental sparring
[04:17:24] Debaters are likely to dismiss not just
[04:17:26] the idea but the people themselves can
[04:17:28] find it difficult to focus yo yo why do
[04:17:31] I always get
[04:17:33] this why do I always shut the [ __ ] up
[04:17:36] you don't know me you don't know me you
[04:17:39] don't know
[04:17:41] me it's like practical
[04:17:45] matters boredom comes too easily for
[04:17:47] debaters and fresh thoughts of the
[04:17:49] solution I mean yeah that does happen I
[04:17:52] don't think this I think these two I've
[04:17:54] gotten a lot better at because I know
[04:17:57] that a lot of people aren't like me and
[04:17:59] sometimes uh arguing it and like
[04:18:01] debating stuff is just like not the the
[04:18:03] play romantic relationships
[04:18:08] um Sparks may fly opportunities for
[04:18:12] growth that's it okay
[04:18:17] friendships loyalty support and
[04:18:19] emotional feedback these are not
[04:18:23] what the Vaders look for in their
[04:18:25] friendship
[04:18:26] what the last thing people with the
[04:18:29] Vader personality type want to hear is
[04:18:30] you're right okay that's actually true
[04:18:31] but I feel like this is true for
[04:18:33] everyone maybe not oh no that's actually
[04:18:35] not true dude some people
[04:18:38] started singing without knowing what it
[04:18:41] was hi Fang so insensitive and
[04:18:44] intolerant yo why are you flaming me
[04:18:47] I've gotten
[04:18:49] better dude I listen with this listen I
[04:18:54] don't want to hear you're right I want
[04:18:55] someone to tell me listen you're a
[04:18:57] [ __ ] dumbass here's what it is okay
[04:19:00] if I'm dumb tell me I'm
[04:19:04] dumb but I also
[04:19:08] know that some people sometimes just
[04:19:10] need like someone to listen to them and
[04:19:12] I'm bad at that I'm trying to get better
[04:19:14] cuz sometimes I like try to like I'm
[04:19:15] very like try to provide a solution for
[04:19:17] people I try to like every time there's
[04:19:19] a problem like oh no big deal we got
[04:19:21] this and then I like rationalize it but
[04:19:24] some it's not
[04:19:26] good um wasn't there a 21 Savage clip
[04:19:30] about
[04:19:35] this
[04:19:39] I saw you one
[04:19:45] second there's a 21 Savage CP about
[04:19:54] this whatever I can't find
[04:20:01] it I can't find
[04:20:04] it never a dull moment
[04:20:10] someone said typical Leo and someone
[04:20:12] replied space racism yo never a dull
[04:20:15] moment emotions dis yo I don't dismiss
[04:20:20] them this is okay listen
[04:20:23] lament dude being inclined to suppress
[04:20:25] their emotions and feelings when
[04:20:26] Debaters are faced with a friend who
[04:20:28] figuratively literally needs a should to
[04:20:29] cry on them no how to handle the
[04:20:30] situation they are perfectly willing and
[04:20:32] happy to offer a series of rable Reon
[04:20:35] dude dude I I just said this two
[04:20:38] paragraphs
[04:20:40] ago they are
[04:20:43] I soak it in what I need to soak
[04:20:47] in they are perfectly willing and happy
[04:20:50] to offer a series of rational reasonable
[04:20:51] solutions to the problem hand as
[04:20:52] Debaters do in any situation where a
[04:20:53] problem need to be fixed but they are
[04:20:54] certainly not known for their
[04:20:55] sensitivity or outward affection no
[04:20:57] matter how intuitively they may
[04:20:58] understand another's position worse is
[04:20:59] when a debator personality tries to turn
[04:21:01] these emotional situations and something
[04:21:02] they find more comfortable a debate
[04:21:04] given how remarkably good debators are
[04:21:05] arguing both Sid about point they are
[04:21:06] remarkably bad at putting themselves in
[04:21:08] someone else's shoes from an emotional
[04:21:09] standpoint Debaters should avoid at all
[04:21:10] cost of Temptation to turn a discussion
[04:21:12] about the causes of a friend's recent
[04:21:14] breakup into competitive intellectual
[04:21:17] fer
[04:21:20] dude so long as everyone understands not
[04:21:23] to take their words too personally
[04:21:24] anyone who isn't afraid to discuss new
[04:21:26] ideas and have them converted into much
[04:21:29] confetti is likely to find stimulating
[04:21:31] and thought-provoking friends and
[04:21:32] Debaters it's not always a compatibility
[04:21:34] that clicks every but Debaters don't
[04:21:35] care about being liked by everyone
[04:21:36] anyways as long as they get to alternate
[04:21:38] between being the sound board what
[04:21:40] sounding board and the megaphone the
[04:21:43] real friend are about to enroy their
[04:21:43] company for a long
[04:21:46] time is he bothering you
[04:21:52] Queen I mean I I don't
[04:21:55] know some of this isn't true some of

[04:22:03] that's not

[04:22:07] Blustery and fighting nature of debater

[04:40:14] build DMC for
[04:40:16] damage does my DMC actually need damage
[04:40:19] though does it
[04:40:29] matter feel like her scalings are very
[04:40:33] low
[04:40:41] let's
[04:40:47] go oh that's a terrible card for a
[04:40:49] second half good for this one but we
[04:40:51] don't really care about this
[04:40:53] one oh my God I press I pressed three to
[04:40:57] uh four to swap the Gen and she's on
[04:40:59] three XD
[04:41:02] moment I swear by my sword
[04:41:08] settle
[04:41:10] down where the [ __ ] did that guy
[04:41:21] go teams for first half uh anything
[04:41:23] Hydro based is really good cuz these
[04:41:26] guys have a lot of [ __ ] Hydro
[04:41:32] Shields us
[04:41:36] oops bow your
[04:41:38] head I clear this was sh with like
[04:41:41] [ __ ] kokomi not recommended

[04:42:02] instructor into DMC cookie or we cookie
[04:42:05] first wait no DMC has a 20 second cool
[04:42:06] down right so we probably DMC first
[04:42:08] probably Barbara into kakomi fan

[04:42:18] maybe wait did I say Ki oh
[04:42:22] whatever go barar go go Barbara
[04:42:27] go
[04:42:33] me you imagine if we had SRO here
[04:42:35] imagine the more the mest morest damages
[04:42:38] we could
[04:42:42] do our bond is
[04:42:46] strong don't be
[04:42:49] scared imagine how much more damage we
[04:42:51] do
[04:43:02] F running three
[04:43:21] healers [ __ ] I actually don't know where
[04:43:23] oh it's here it's here it's
[04:43:26] here get him get him get him get him
[04:43:31] you oh we got this easy oh my God we got
[04:43:34] this easy
[04:43:37] easy oh my dude this is a team with only
[04:43:42] hyper blo damage by the
[04:43:45] way strong I don't want to kill it too
[04:43:48] fast
[04:43:49] but the
[04:43:51] hell wait is hyper Bloom good no I
[04:43:55] thought we were no we've been lied to no
[04:43:57] no it can't be let's try attack uh these
[04:44:00] cards are [ __ ] useless for our second
[04:44:02] half but our first half is good cuz net
[04:44:03] so it doesn't matter
[04:44:05] uh we're getting carried I
[04:44:07] guess we'll do attack for the second
[04:44:09] half sure no we won't and do we have HP
[04:44:13] scaling characters I mean technically
[04:44:15] Kookie Barbara but not really we'll do
[04:44:19] attack HP is definitely better but like
[04:44:22] I don't care about our yeah attack
[04:44:23] doesn't do anything but it's fine no
[04:44:25] cards we're playing hard
[04:44:27] mode I swear by my
[04:44:33] sword
[04:44:35] a this is a terrible clear right
[04:44:42] now strike a pose strike
[04:44:47] pose let the mighty be humble we have on
[04:44:51] Jee just forward ENT on a Healer build
[04:44:52] so attack attack healer bonus my Gene
[04:44:54] guide should be out in a day or two uh
[04:44:56] probably no no not I think my next video
[04:44:57] is uh farming for Finas it should be in
[04:44:59] like two three
[04:45:03] days he me shower me
[04:45:06] with where are my
[04:45:09] balls oh I should have Fina burst I
[04:45:11] didn't want
[04:45:12] to that's fine not the fastest first
[04:45:15] half but it's fine we're not
[04:45:17] speedrunning wow I really should have
[04:45:19] finina bursted what the [ __ ] okay this
[04:45:21] is scuffed this is
[04:45:27] terrible bro can you die oh my God
[04:45:30] there's this [ __ ] this was a terrible
[04:45:32] first half I don't even want to
[04:45:35] it's fine we're still going to play this
[04:45:36] we're still going to play it and we're
[04:45:38] against enemies on dendro res that was
[04:45:40] disgusting that was disgusting if we
[04:45:41] still clear this uh it's a Christmas
[04:45:43] miracle we're a genius I should reset
[04:45:45] here this enemy has Omega dendr res by
[04:45:47] the
[04:45:50] way
[04:46:02] me SLE this
[04:46:09] oh I want my cookie out I was like what
[04:46:11] the
[04:46:15] [ __ ] go away I have no Hydro I have no
[04:46:17] Hydro I [ __ ] up I [ __ ] up all my
[04:46:20] coold
[04:46:32] Downs I don't know if we clear this
[04:46:35] pretty bad first half and bad uh
[04:46:36] rotation
[04:46:39] but I mean there's a chance hyper Bloom
[04:46:41] is pretty broken but this guy does have
[04:46:43] D
[04:46:58] res we are just pressing the mouse one
[04:47:00] button without thinking at all out of my
[04:47:03] way
[04:47:05] I have no D I have no D I have no D I'm
[04:47:07] not even hyper
[04:47:08] blooming well I think we're fine
[04:47:16] though wait what the [ __ ] I thought
[04:47:18] hyper Blom was bad what I'm kidding I
[04:47:20] didn't think it was
[04:47:22] bad H Hyper's not broken though these
[04:47:25] characters suck
[04:47:27] scratch I mean I'm on a solar Pearl
[04:47:33] unrelatable
[04:47:42] H 150 clear yeah but it was also the AL
[04:47:45] like the absolute worst hyper Blom comp
[04:47:47] you can use basically because you don't
[04:47:48] have Singo or a good dendro and
[04:47:52] um it was a dendr resistant enemy so
[04:47:55] usually like your SRO official will do
[04:47:58] way more there like I'd much rather play
[04:48:00] sucros with Fel and S and and SRO and
[04:48:03] then dendro my hyper Balloon Team if the
[04:48:06] enemy is very danger like resistant
[04:48:07] right cuz you want your damage to come
[04:48:09] from the other sources but even despite
[04:48:11] that we still
[04:48:12] cleared that actually motivated me for
[04:48:15] my free to play count to play hyper
[04:48:16] Bloom I wasn't going to now I kind of
[04:48:17] want to oh my God I SW nothing dude how
[04:48:20] do I get no Hydro I have [ __ ] finina
[04:48:22] what I won't do that I think I can still
[04:48:24] get
[04:48:28] this let the mighty be
[04:48:33] humble will end you this literally
[04:48:35] motivated me to play my fre Play account
[04:48:37] but I was going to play quick and not
[04:48:38] hyper
[04:48:39] Bloom

[04:52:30] I thought I couldn't for some reason and
[04:52:32] my E Auto targeted okay cool that was
[04:52:34] the worst possible uh series of events
[04:52:36] my E Auto targeted that so I didn't get
[04:52:38] balls and then I wasted three
[04:52:41] balls
[04:52:43] Sanctified skill issue on display for
[04:52:45] everyone to
[04:52:53] see
[04:53:00] cool don't be
[04:53:02] scared bond is
[04:53:06] dratter I have to stay close for my like
[04:53:08] Hydra ring and my uh cookie
[04:53:17] ring
[04:53:21] away out of my
[04:53:26] way terminate
[04:53:30] propagate come on we can do it we can do
[04:53:35] it yeah my first half was pretty bad
[04:53:38] this time but relatable I
[04:53:42] guess I didn't Auto attack on Barbara
[04:53:45] there I got like no hyper blooms we need
[04:53:46] to Auto attack on Barbara
[04:53:52] more
[04:53:58] scared
[04:54:02] you
[04:54:05] we might not get this we might though
[04:54:07] it's actually pretty close out
[04:54:11] of I froze
[04:54:16] myself [ __ ] I didn't know I had no cooky
[04:54:18] ring forgot that for a little
[04:54:22] bit
[04:54:25] away I need to play more Hydro ooh I
[04:54:29] okay we almost got it I just need to
[04:54:30] Auto attack on Barbara a little more
[04:54:32] okay okay we got this was Auto attack on
[04:54:34] barara a little more I just I [ __ ] up
[04:54:36] cuz I kept getting Frozen and [ __ ] I
[04:54:37] wasn't uh applying enough
[04:54:40] Hydro dude those enemies are so cringe
[04:54:48] though yeah Barbara freezes
[04:54:57] you I mean obviously you should have
[04:54:59] Singo on that team so it's not
[04:55:01] like obviously SRO can free you with his
[04:55:04] skill but like SRO SRO he carries
[04:55:19] that swear by my
[04:55:25] sword I don't think I swirled that other
[04:55:27] one yeah no damage the well I mean
[04:55:29] actually I think I did the damage or
[04:55:31] maybe the V wore off I don't know damage
[04:55:33] is is the
[04:55:48] same might a team has zero MV yeah it
[04:55:51] does it does cuz it was the team that
[04:55:54] was not recommended so I I'm trying to
[04:55:56] see if like it's still you know just
[04:55:58] trying to experience it just trying to
[04:56:00] experience pure hyper blo in a situation
[04:56:02] where you shouldn't just to see like
[04:56:04] what it's
[04:56:06] like I need to Auto attack a lot more on
[04:56:08] Barbara it's just
[04:56:16] annoying B
[04:56:23] bro I friend
[04:56:32] that
[04:56:35] too many hyper blooms at once we lost
[04:56:37] value it's
[04:56:42] okay froze
[04:56:45] myself I'm
[04:56:49] afraid don't be
[04:56:51] scared yeah this te has like no damage
[04:56:53] but I mean hyper blue but I mean like no
[04:56:55] personal
[04:56:56] damage and when when you hyper too many
[04:56:58] cores at once it doesn't do all the
[04:57:00] damage to an enemy so it's like wasted
[04:57:04] need to stay on top of my cookie
[04:57:10] rotation better time than last time
[04:57:13] though go bar go Barbara go don't
[04:57:24] die don't be
[04:57:27] scared oh this is so easy what the [ __ ]
[04:57:29] we have so much time we have so much
[04:57:31] time on a zero MV
[04:57:54] team not going to lie this looks bad I
[04:57:56] mean yeah it's the worst hyper Bloom
[04:57:58] team possible like basically like you
[04:58:00] have no damage outside hyper blo and it
[04:58:02] still was like basically enough like
[04:58:07] yeah good job on playing hyper dude
[04:58:09] someone was [ __ ] on
[04:58:11] it like I'm saying like ideally single
[04:58:14] Target situation obviously that enemy
[04:58:15] had D res like the second one and the
[04:58:17] third one's annoying but like single
[04:58:18] Target you can do something like this
[04:58:20] and then sug hyper blooms for you with a
[04:58:22] dendo character so you do this this
[04:58:23] fishal two really powerful single Target
[04:58:25] characters and like this seems good
[04:58:27] without hyper blo it's good without
[04:58:28] hyper blo right so then you be like oh
[04:58:30] but but then hyper is literally free bro
[04:58:32] it's it's [ __ ] free Mr of all time
[04:58:36] could you give me a second opinion on if
[04:58:38] I should live in Marain for instead of
[04:58:41] getting nothing from villion or keep my
[04:58:43] current Mar is more
[04:58:46] efficient Mar is more efficient but you
[04:58:49] can strong box Vermillion so if it's
[04:58:51] just Foria you can also save fore strong
[04:58:52] box or Mar
[04:58:56] CH playing never at fre night yeah but I
[04:58:59] only have three characters in it and
[04:59:00] like it was just to try the second team
[04:59:02] also it is it's unrealistic to assume
[04:59:04] someone won't have SRO if they're at
[04:59:06] floor 12 because it's in the shop unless
[04:59:08] you're mismanaging your star glitter or
[04:59:10] choose to never pull which is
[04:59:11] respectable so fair I guess but like
[04:59:14] it's unrealistic to assume your best
[04:59:16] Hydro is Barbara is my
[04:59:18] point assuming you have any Hydro
[04:59:20] character that isn't Barbara you will
[04:59:21] perform and Candace you'll perform
[04:59:23] significantly
[04:59:24] better why is sucros this I don't know I
[04:59:27] might change it I think it's
[04:59:32] funny
[04:59:39] okay chat uh the gon live stream is soon
[04:59:42] and I said I was ending an hour ago
[04:59:43] because I have to stream star rail
[04:59:45] tomorrow so I don't know why I didn't
[04:59:46] end I'm going to stream star rail
[04:59:48] tomorrow the banner comes out Argent and
[04:59:50] haa I know they're out for Asia and for

[04:59:55] guide or a short guide for the future St
[04:59:58] characters starting at Ron may but I
[04:59:59] don't want to do Argent te for reasons

[05:00:04] normal second Channel video and have fun
[05:00:05] with him and we're going to stream him
[05:00:06] on his na release roughly which is
[05:00:09] tomorrow at 12:00 but I think I'm going
[05:00:11] to be live a bit late probably like 3:
[05:00:13] or 400 P p.m. just because I have stuff
[05:00:15] to do during the day um so I might be a
[05:00:18] bit late but afternoon tomorrow we're
