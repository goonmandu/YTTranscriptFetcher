[00:11:49] her C4 is cool so like cool but also why
[00:11:53] is she here and then Razer makes no
[00:11:54] sense so this banner I I honestly think
[00:11:57] they're trying to get rid of filler
[00:11:58] fourstar sorry Yen I like you uh uh like
[00:12:03] they're using a lot of filler forars so
[00:12:04] that people don't pull and then they
[00:12:06] pull on like for nland they're going to
[00:12:07] do like [ __ ] I don't even know what
[00:12:09] they're G to do like f what are they
[00:12:10] going to do for they're just saving all
[00:12:11] the good characters for N I don't know
[00:12:16] maybe but yeah as root slander pointed
[00:12:20] out was it Yen on a banner recently or
[00:12:22] am I tripping Yen well I don't know how
[00:12:24] to check banners
[00:12:27] genin is there like a a Wiki page for
[00:12:32] this because I feel like we got her
[00:12:35] recently let me look this genin Wiki
[00:12:43] banners six
[00:12:47] months okay what am I scrolling through
[00:12:49] right
[00:12:55] now is there a page for event wishes
[00:13:18] check Yen's page dink donk no but it's
[00:13:22] cool to have a banner list wait what is
[00:13:24] this game with.net do I want to click
[00:13:26] this [ __ ] it whatever
[00:13:32] wow this is an ugly ass
[00:13:33] website uh where was Yen let's
[00:13:37] see that's this patch okay Yen Yen what
[00:13:41] she was at
[00:13:43] 4.6 oh 4.5 uh 45 whatever she's right
[00:13:49] there
[00:13:54] bro so like again no disrespect to Yen
[00:13:57] but like hello
[00:13:59] Shen's here Shang Ling's here
[00:14:02] and and razer's a
[00:14:05] sneak this is actually a a filler Banner
[00:14:08] cuz they're like [ __ ] Emily no one wants
[00:14:10] her except me I mean I want her I think
[00:14:12] burning looks
[00:14:19] cool so anyways
[00:14:23] um the BYU of this patch I
[00:14:27] guess uh yeah so
[00:14:29] Silver Lining is that I guess they're
[00:14:31] saving good four stars for the next
[00:14:33] banners I I don't
[00:14:35] know uh Yan's really strong
[00:14:38] though I was theba making a video for
[00:14:40] her but I I think I have no time now so
[00:14:42] probably not but she's really
[00:14:44] good in case you were
[00:14:46] wondering um let me write something down
[00:14:54] actually
[00:14:57] anyways uh and then there's the weapon
[00:14:59] manner which I did not look at but
[00:15:01] looking at it now uh oh yeah they posted
[00:15:03] what the weapon does right no porn
[00:15:05] acting here I can go pull it up yeah
[00:15:07] they did um looking at these weapons I
[00:15:10] mean fav bow fav Lance are both great uh
[00:15:12] flute sucks the wandering weapon like
[00:15:15] wandering everstar and whatever the [ __ ]
[00:15:17] makyra
[00:15:18] aquamar um they're they're like these
[00:15:20] are honestly not bad like the weap is
[00:15:22] actually not bad uh flute sucks five you
[00:15:25] get for free but you want refinements
[00:15:27] five like bow Lance is always great to
[00:15:29] have you might have a 100 by now so like
[00:15:31] I don't like for me it's like whatever
[00:15:33] but having a lot of five weapons is good
[00:15:36] uh the wandering thing I literally have
[00:15:37] to look up what wandering uh uh even
[00:15:39] star does I preloaded this wandering
[00:15:43] even
[00:15:44] star it's em I know what makyra doeses
[00:15:47] but I I think it's just the same thing
[00:15:48] which I just read it and it looks like
[00:15:50] the same thing um what the [ __ ] I'm
[00:15:52] lagging okay yeah it's just a em stat
[00:15:55] stick that gives you some attack em gets
[00:15:57] converted to attack
[00:15:59] yeah so n it's okay like it's good you
[00:16:03] use on like I guess Vape characters Nita
[00:16:07] whatever like it's fine but like why
[00:16:09] wouldn't you just use like okay for Nita
[00:16:10] cool I I get it but for like almost
[00:16:13] anyone else I feel like there's just
[00:16:14] better options but it's okay yeah yeah
[00:16:18] but like how does it I don't know I'm a
[00:16:20] you're going to hate me for this but I'm
[00:16:21] a witth simp but anyways it's not bad uh
[00:16:24] makyra is also pretty good it's kind of
[00:16:26] like mhy is basically like the
[00:16:29] it gives me similar Vibes to mailed
[00:16:30] flowers which is a really solid free to
[00:16:32] playay
[00:16:33] weapon but anyways like they're not
[00:16:35] needed but they're they're they're
[00:16:36] pretty decent
[00:16:42] um oh yeah true
[00:16:46] actually I forgot about that nearby
[00:16:49] party members gain 30% of this
[00:16:52] buff okay so you gain a little bit of a
[00:16:55] but isn't it flat attack so it's not
[00:16:57] even like that big
[00:17:00] cuz what is it it's 24% like okay 24 to
[00:17:02] I guess
[00:17:03] 48% of your em as attack but it's flat
[00:17:07] attack I mean it's it's fine like if you
[00:17:10] get it for everyone it's fine whatever I
[00:17:11] I don't care I they're they're okay
[00:17:15] weapons they're okay honestly the four
[00:17:17] stars are not bad it's just flute sucks
[00:17:19] the rest are pretty good uh Aqua simuler
[00:17:21] you already know how I feel about this
[00:17:23] it is a great bow but I don't recommend
[00:17:25] it I don't recommend pulling for it for
[00:17:27] yolan but I think it's fine to pull for
[00:17:29] account it's really good for like every
[00:17:30] bow user yolan she can use it well but I
[00:17:33] I'd rather if you're going to get a five
[00:17:35] star for her I'd rather get El plus she
[00:17:37] needs a lot of ER on a lot of teams so I
[00:17:38] would use just the freeto play fav but
[00:17:40] if you don't need ER then Aqua is broken
[00:17:41] on her so like well really good on her
[00:17:43] so cool uh lumad
[00:17:45] elegy they just posted what it does uh I
[00:17:48] can tell you what it
[00:17:50] does it [ __ ] well okay let's read it
[00:17:54] oh well this weapon looks stupid for
[00:17:58] Emily but we don't like legally I don't
[00:18:00] know what Emily does however I know what
[00:18:03] Emily does cuz come on we've seen it
[00:18:05] okay look 68 base attack 33% crit rate
[00:18:09] okay fine stats sck sure a lot of crit
[00:18:12] rate that's like this is like homo stats
[00:18:14] right well P but flipped attack is
[00:18:18] increased by 15% cool then so this is
[00:18:22] what like statti for every character I
[00:18:24] just put my hand on my screen you can't
[00:18:25] see it statti for every character is 608
[00:18:28] base attack with 30 3 crit rate which is
[00:18:29] good and 15% attack so already fine I'm
[00:18:33] going to have to mention this in every
[00:18:34] weapon ranking ever isn't H 88 crit
[00:18:36] damage no it's
[00:18:37] 66 uh anyways so that's that then after
[00:18:41] the equipping character triggers burning
[00:18:43] on an opponent or deals dendro damage to
[00:18:46] burning opponents so whenever there's
[00:18:47] burning
[00:18:48] basically um or burning is triggered the
[00:18:51] damage dealt is increased by 18% last
[00:18:53] for eight seconds Stacks two times so 18
[00:18:56] * 2 36% damage when two stacks are
[00:18:58] reached or when the duration is
[00:19:00] refreshed at two stacks restore 12
[00:19:03] energy this can happen once every 12
[00:19:06] seconds uh and can be triggered when
[00:19:08] you're off field so first of all decent
[00:19:11] stats well solid stat stick second of
[00:19:13] all what the [ __ ] is this 12 energy
[00:19:15] every 12 seconds that's a lot that's a
[00:19:17] lot of energy that's a lot of energy if
[00:19:20] you're
[00:19:21] burning so assuming Emily needs ER which
[00:19:25] I assume she will this is going to make
[00:19:27] your ER needs like
[00:19:29] way
[00:19:32] smaller um
[00:19:36] however we'll talk about if it's good or
[00:19:38] not when Emily's actually out I will say
[00:19:41] though that pulling assuming she's a
[00:19:44] support and like you know I mean we can
[00:19:46] assume that she
[00:19:47] is never feel like you need to get a
[00:19:49] signature for your support character
[00:19:51] like sometimes I'll see like weapon C
[00:19:52] like even with chorin who's not a
[00:19:54] support but like it'll be like this
[00:19:55] weapon gives you a 20% damage increase
[00:19:58] but you're like okay but you only do
[00:19:59] half of your team's damage cuz FAL does
[00:20:01] the other half so it's like a 10% team
[00:20:02] DPS increase so you got to take things
[00:20:04] with a Grandin of salt never feel like
[00:20:06] you need to pull uh cuz you know that's
[00:20:08] how they get you however good weapon
[00:20:10] well it looks pretty solid uh for Emily
[00:20:13] and outside of that okay stat stick well
[00:20:15] I say okay but like it's it's still like
[00:20:17] it's good it's a lot of stats but I
[00:20:19] wouldn't choose it over like
[00:20:21] a well let's see
[00:20:26] actually uh let me look at the poems I
[00:20:28] have H is what same stats virtually the
[00:20:31] exact same stats but I lose out on 15%
[00:20:33] attack and instead gain on well attack
[00:20:36] based on my HP so
[00:20:39] 8% of my HP which like with Shia is
[00:20:47] 24K let me Cal this plus
[00:20:50] 20% okay let's assume over 50% HP I
[00:20:52] again
[00:20:54] 8% let me Cal this do I have a
[00:20:56] calculator my my keyboard is too small I
[00:20:58] don't have a calculator hotkey I'm just
[00:20:59] going to look up
[00:21:00] Cal using this keyboard today let's say
[00:21:03] 25 KP
[00:21:05] time8 right is it
[00:21:08] point8 yeah wait well I did times point8
[00:21:11] oops 20 wait how much HP do I
[00:21:17] have dude [ __ ] this okay I'm using
[00:21:20] Windows C this C is dog [ __ ] one sec one
[00:21:21] sec one sec I don't want to leak
[00:21:26] everything yum yum
[00:21:29] okay I got it uh
[00:21:32] 25k
[00:21:34] time uh8 divided by 100 which is
[00:21:39] 0.8 200 right I didn't [ __ ] this up 200
[00:21:44] attack which is the equivalent
[00:21:47] of what's
[00:21:49] the God God God what's the equivalent of
[00:21:53] attack for him right now let's say I go
[00:21:55] I mean I should probably keep the same
[00:21:56] weapon let's I have 2500 attack
[00:22:02] uh how much attack was that was 200 you
[00:22:05] [Music]
[00:22:10] do so it's like 12 it's like 12 to 133%
[00:22:14] of my attack it's basically Which is
[00:22:16] less than 15 but basically the
[00:22:20] same basically the same above well I
[00:22:23] guess slightly worse but yeah basically
[00:22:25] the same above 50% HP and then under
[00:22:27] it's worse by quite a
[00:22:30] bit
[00:22:31] okay so stats stick seems good actually
[00:22:35] seems really I think this weapon going
[00:22:36] to be broken on Emily but like it's
[00:22:38] broken if you can proc the burning but I
[00:22:39] don't think any other character can proc
[00:22:41] the burning there's no Dental pole arm
[00:22:42] other than yao yao
[00:22:51] right oh I guess you could give it to
[00:22:53] like a yeah you can give it to a pyro
[00:22:55] too so like wait this actually could be
[00:22:58] insane on Shang Ling wait wait no wait
[00:23:02] but wait who does after the equ
[00:23:03] character triggers
[00:23:06] burning okay well okay the way burning
[00:23:10] triggers is like whoever applies the
[00:23:12] last element to burn like I'm pretty
[00:23:14] sure when the aura is there and you redo
[00:23:16] it it's whoever applied the last element
[00:23:18] I think like with dendro here is just
[00:23:20] apply dendro and you're fine but with
[00:23:21] pyro I think you have to be the one to
[00:23:23] proc it which I think Shang Ling will
[00:23:39] Dam dam she can actually use this
[00:23:41] then um I'm curious to test or see at
[00:23:45] least how efficient the the how easy it
[00:23:48] is to proc the passive on someone that's
[00:23:49] not Emily on Emily obviously you can or
[00:23:51] a dendo character obviously you can
[00:23:52] maybe a future Dental pole arm um but
[00:23:56] for for like Shang Ling I I I know you
[00:23:59] can
[00:24:00] but I wonder if it I don't know we'll
[00:24:02] see I guess but it's definitely good but
[00:24:05] the thing is yeah I don't know if you
[00:24:06] can double stack in time cuz like what
[00:24:07] if you're running Nita Nita reapplies
[00:24:09] the dendro and then she'll be the
[00:24:11] burning trigger I think and if you're
[00:24:13] playing like Kaza Kazo might pyro SW I
[00:24:15] don't know I mean
[00:24:17] yeah anyways stat stick
[00:24:22] um yeah I think the five stars I think
[00:24:26] unironically the character Banners are
[00:24:28] kind of [ __ ] and the weapon Banner is
[00:24:31] decent like I think aqua and lumid are
[00:24:34] good it's hard to tell how good a new
[00:24:37] five star is but like this one looks I
[00:24:39] mean it's at least a solid SAS stick and
[00:24:41] then it looks like it's very much tailor
[00:24:44] made for Emily or a burning character
[00:24:46] which you know makes it good uh and then
[00:24:50] the four stars are decent except flute
[00:24:51] [ __ ]
[00:24:53] flute okay that's all
[00:25:03] how would I get this for
[00:25:06] arlino okay unironically though Jade
[00:25:09] spear Jade spear if you have it is
[00:25:11] already a pretty solid option for arino
[00:25:13] because she can actually make use of all
[00:25:15] the stats for once um but if you're
[00:25:17] saying can you use this on her I mean
[00:25:19] yeah it's it's [ __ ] basically crit
[00:25:21] rate homo with attack percent like it's
[00:25:23] good I don't think you're going to play
[00:25:25] I mean are you going to play burning art
[00:25:26] Lino probably not with Emily no comment
[00:25:30] I mean literally no comment but from
[00:25:32] like assuming you are sure can she
[00:25:35] reliably trigger the
[00:25:37] burning
[00:25:39] probably I have to test it I don't
[00:25:42] know like I don't I haven't tested it I
[00:25:44] don't [ __ ] know but it depends how
[00:25:47] much burning how much
[00:25:50] uh dendro you have oh yeah but even then
[00:25:53] well no the damage increase is huge the
[00:25:55] ER is useless for arino mostly
[00:25:58] but the the damage bonus is pretty big
[00:26:00] 18 even just
[00:26:02] 18% but 36 obviously is a lot anyways
[00:26:06] I'll shut up uh
[00:26:08] yeah I don't think I'm going to pull uh
[00:26:11] I think we just well I'm going to get
[00:26:12] Emily obviously but I don't think I'm
[00:26:14] going to get weapon although it is
[00:26:16] pretty I will say the weapon's very
[00:26:18] cool
[00:26:21] okay uh back to salling sorry cream
[00:26:33] okay I'll shut up I'll shut up let me

[00:56:08] away knowledge stored in books does not
[00:56:10] wisdom make no more than the Reflections
[00:56:12] in a lake is the real thing fools drink
[00:56:14] themselves into hypothetical stores
[00:56:17] while the sagacious seek truth earnestly
[00:56:20] do not be dece oh sters do not be
[00:56:22] deceived by false paralysis but do not
[00:56:24] make Reckless decisions either cool
[00:56:27] rationality is the front of hope within
[00:56:31] chaos bro I asked for my fortune what
[00:56:34] are why are you reading the [ __ ]
[00:56:35] dictionary to
[00:56:43] me I'm not adding an emote called These
[00:56:51] Nuts okay you misspelled his name
[00:56:53] there's a s
[00:56:56] but
[00:57:03] anyways check the 5.0 list you made it
[00:57:06] wasn't that on my laptop though so
[00:57:07] technically I'm not bound by it okay I
[00:57:09] have to pee uh let me zoom in
[00:57:15] on I was going to say who's the newest
[00:57:17] character but I remember it's seedin
[00:57:19] yeah that's not happening
[00:57:22] uh no [ __ ] it you guys get sh okay
[00:57:27] one second
[00:58:04] for
[00:58:41] oh my God I I'm back I'm back oh my God
[00:58:46] oh my
[00:58:48] God wait one
[00:58:53] sec Chad I have a question
[00:58:56] okay I'm going to I was thinking of this
[00:58:58] while I was peeing H so okay okay okay
[00:59:00] this theater is three elements right
[00:59:02] it's Hydro cryo anemo
[00:59:07] famously uh Hydro characters have like
[00:59:09] no [ __ ] four stars for some
[00:59:11] reason okay I going to run a poll right
[00:59:15] now cuz I want to see something okay
[00:59:17] this is a sample size of like I don't
[00:59:18] know let's say 4K people okay if you
[00:59:21] still play the game right now don't
[00:59:23] don't vote on this if you don't play it
[00:59:25] okay or have played a lot like even if
[00:59:27] you don't play like right now like have
[00:59:28] played a lot I'm doing a I want to see
[00:59:31] like how many people actually
[00:59:33] have five star hydros okay so do you
[00:59:37] have five star Hydro parenthesis s okay
[00:59:42] responses one five star
[00:59:45] Hydro 2 to three 28 four to five plus
[00:59:51] zero
[00:59:53] none actually let me rephrase this how
[00:59:56] many five star hydros do you have I want
[01:00:00] to see this Hydro MC does not count hydr
[01:00:02] MC does not count if you count hydr MC
[01:00:04] [ __ ] you that's not a real character
[01:00:12] sorry yeah you count Mona Mona counts
[01:00:14] Mona's good well she's not good but like
[01:00:16] she's good enough to replace she's
[01:00:17] decent she replaces other five stars she
[01:00:21] counts anyone that clicks one I assume
[01:00:24] it's Mona but the if you press like if
[01:00:26] you have like SRO Mona and a five star
[01:00:28] you chose to pull for you you probably
[01:00:30] have a good amount of like like if you
[01:00:32] chose nevet or you chose like yolon and
[01:00:34] you have SRO and you have Mona you're
[01:00:39] fine oh this is actually crazy like this
[01:00:42] is like I know like there's nothing that
[01:00:44] proves that this poll is true but this
[01:00:46] is actually crazy that only 2% have
[01:00:54] none I have eight yeah I mean I have I
[01:00:56] mean yeah yeah that's
[01:00:59] crazy okay
[01:01:03] noted but okay I will also admit that I
[01:01:07] think the highest pull priority like the
[01:01:10] closest thing to a must pull is any five
[01:01:12] star Hydro if you don't have another one
[01:01:14] like if you have no Hydro on your
[01:01:16] account other than justing too there's
[01:01:18] almost nothing that's worth more than
[01:01:19] another Hydro
[01:01:23] character I think it's that and then
[01:01:25] Nita
[01:01:27] Kaza okay sein doesn't sein literally
[01:01:30] ruins you know like the video essays of
[01:01:32] how this one character broke the
[01:01:35] foundational laws of the universe sein
[01:01:37] breaks every Theory but if you throw
[01:01:39] sein in the in the jail everything else
[01:01:42] makes sense like neu's really good but
[01:01:44] she doesn't like you know there's some
[01:01:46] hydros that aren't your standard Hydro
[01:01:48] like n is great to have but she's not
[01:01:50] like she doesn't feel like a hydro like
[01:01:53] you know you have to like make your team
[01:01:54] around her but it's not hard to do she's
[01:01:57] like her own
[01:01:58] team anyways okay noted honestly then
[01:02:02] okay assuming that sample size is
[01:02:06] true I feel
[01:02:09] like cryo is like probably one of the
[01:02:12] well outside of Gio like the worst
[01:02:13] element to get for this thing even
[01:02:15] though there's a lot of characters
[01:02:18] like I feel like crowd characters either
[01:02:20] like they [ __ ] or they do
[01:02:22] nothing like half the crowd characters
[01:02:24] are great and then the other half are
[01:02:25] kind of just is
[01:02:28] there how many [ __ ] characters are
[01:02:30] there in this game now dude there's so
[01:02:36] many no crow five star since Shena but
[01:02:39] is that real there rizzly bro what you
[01:02:41] what are you yapping
[01:02:48] about yeah like I feel
[01:02:51] like yeah
[01:02:58] but anyone's not bad don5 thank you I
[01:03:02] put into my theater line oh
[01:03:06] boy dude honestly the thing with theater
[01:03:08] is like lowkey we'll do I didn't do act
[01:03:11] to yet okay I didn't do it I don't know
[01:03:13] if it's harder but like because it's not
[01:03:16] that hard it all it is is like do you
[01:03:18] have the characters and then if you do
[01:03:19] you're chilling and if you don't like it
[01:03:22] doesn't matter if the characters are bad
[01:03:23] because it's not hard so you could use
[01:03:25] any [ __ ]
[01:03:28] I hope they make it harder though like
[01:03:30] if they do I'm telling you if they just
[01:03:31] made this game
[01:03:33] mode either harder or more riant on
[01:03:36] Buffs like like like on the boons or
[01:03:38] whatever like simulated Universe it
[01:03:39] would be so much it would go from like
[01:03:42] kind of whatever to like really
[01:03:46] good hello
[01:03:48] Wolfie all right season two Hydro cryo

[01:04:35] it's not bad uh with Vermilion though
[01:04:37] you kind of get a lot of attack I would
[01:04:39] still try to get a better one maybe with

[01:26:50] shenon over here okay
[01:26:54] when storytellers tell Tales pertaining
[01:26:56] to oneself they often resort to slap
[01:26:59] Dash Stitch work derived from decrepit
[01:27:02] documents garnished with a glut of
[01:27:05] aggrandisement entertaining to be sure
[01:27:08] but do not believe everything you hear
[01:27:10] of course if you wish to hear the truth
[01:27:12] you need only ask
[01:27:14] me wait this isn't straight in fact one
[01:27:18] is suddenly reminded of an old tale it

[01:49:42] changling rly how you doing
[01:49:45] king after taking a look around here I'm
[01:49:48] wondering whether to expand our library
[01:49:50] at The Fortress of marpit
[01:49:54] then again most of our collection
[01:49:56] consists of legal advice pamphlets and
[01:49:58] mechanics textbooks which no one reads
[01:50:02] so maybe not this voice is so dumb like
[01:50:04] just hire a librarian you're right those
[01:50:06] would be more popular and that's also
[01:50:09] why you can never find why would a
[01:50:10] prison hire a librarian disappear from
[01:50:12] the shelves I I guess that's the thing I
[01:50:14] don't know maybe it is but I feel like
[01:50:15] do you even need to like like it's just
[01:50:17] like just buy
[01:50:19] books rehabilitation
[01:50:23] okay sure but like like Ken rly what is
[01:50:26] he even doing he's just there sorry but
[01:50:28] like you surely don't have that much to
[01:50:31] do okay fine get a get a librarian sorry
[01:50:33] we got quite a few punishing ahead of us
[01:50:36] don't we you ready if life gets too dull
[01:50:39] for too long I start to feel numb inside
[01:50:42] I need some excitement to make me feel
[01:50:44] alive me too that's why I I play this
[01:50:48] game dice if I like the numbers I roll

[01:51:14] here finina hi
[01:51:18] finina whenever I'm reading a story I
[01:51:21] like to picture it vividly in my mind in
[01:51:23] the theater of my imagination the [ __ ]
[01:51:25] is this scene plays out in full color I
[01:51:28] can see the Expressions on the
[01:51:30] characters's faces hear their words feel
[01:51:33] the Cadence of their speech text on the
[01:51:36] page is transformed into a spellbinding
[01:51:39] show and I watch with baited breath to
[01:51:42] see where each person's story will take
[01:51:44] them so you see I'm not just another
[01:51:48] celebrity I've got solid directing chops
[01:51:50] too
[01:51:57] okay is it too early look not
[01:52:00] to I'm going to say it
[01:52:03] now and
[01:52:07] look I'm going to say it before Nat land
[01:52:09] and also shz comes out finina might be
[01:52:12] top one archon sorry sorry sorry we'll
[01:52:14] see
[01:52:17] though um
[01:52:23] companion
[01:52:24] random oh I can't well I can but it's
[01:52:26] going to be the same one I mean whatever
[01:52:28] [ __ ]
[01:52:29] it I've been waiting for you for ages
[01:52:32] I've been waiting for you for
[01:52:39] ages nobody disagrees okay but like I'm
[01:52:42] I'm pre-ordering my take now cuz
[01:52:44] everyone's going to disagree anytime
[01:52:45] there's a new [ __ ] archon you
[01:52:47] [ __ ] not only anytime anyone
[01:52:49] says anything bad about a character you
[01:52:51] like hate bandwagon them I saw when bro
[01:52:53] was like oh I don't really like finina
[01:52:55] at the start and then everyone was like
[01:52:56] oh [ __ ] you it's like bro let him have
[01:52:57] an opinion that's number one number two
[01:52:59] just just you wait okay they're going to
[01:53:01] give us like an archon Quest oh my God
[01:53:02] this this archon is so cool and then you
[01:53:04] be like best archon ever best archon
[01:53:06] Quest ever last archon's worse it
[01:53:09] happens every
[01:53:12] patch however I am also recency biased
[01:53:15] because I like
[01:53:18] finina Ryden Shogun clears I fear okay
[01:53:21] you're just horny which is fine like
[01:53:23] that's fine I'm not judging you but you
[01:53:25] like recognize what you
[01:53:43] are I think Ryden is
[01:53:47] like Peak visually but I don't know
[01:53:50] about the like uh I don't know what the
[01:53:52] archon quest compared to sumaru
[01:53:56] or uh
[01:53:59] font principal cast defeat the villain
[01:54:02] with time limit bonus challenge star
[01:54:03] challenge okay sure what is this
[01:54:04] interrupt Emperor fire and iron searings
[01:54:06] coronation I assume that's when he's reg
[01:54:09] regening uh we'll just put a bunch of
[01:54:10] Hydra in the team
[01:54:12] Ayo
[01:54:17] yolon and then anything so let's do like
[01:54:20] YULA
[01:54:32] Barbara okay
[01:54:34] boom
[01:54:36] boom boom boom no it's
[01:54:43] fine IO gameplay
[01:54:47] riveting f for mercy of frost I for
[01:54:55] I'm literally
[01:54:58] one-handed more
[01:55:01] speed quietly
[01:55:09] now wait so do I have to kill him now oh
[01:55:11] no during the coronation so he's going
[01:55:13] to do an animation I
[01:55:16] assume mind the daily
[01:55:25] why is my damage lowkey midet I mean I
[01:55:28] know I'm not really playing a team
[01:55:29] that's probably why
[01:55:31] but no don't
[01:55:34] die wait what's the coronation wait huh
[01:55:39] wait was that it did I miss
[01:55:43] it wait what was the
[01:55:45] coronation [ __ ] wait run it back run it
[01:55:48] back was it that I just have killed them
[01:55:51] [ __ ]
[01:55:56] why does yolan work with IO when he
[01:55:58] doesn't do normal attacks he does normal
[01:56:00] attacks inside of his skill that's why
[01:56:01] Eko Buffs him CU his normal attack
[01:56:03] damage and he's not going a skill damage
[01:56:04] to that like golden troop also that's
[01:56:06] one two cuz he's a good designed
[01:56:08] character unlike burst where it doesn't
[01:56:09] work for some lame [ __ ] reason oh
[01:56:11] it's burst damage de's actually designed
[01:56:13] well [ __ ] you sorry no but like it
[01:56:15] should work on De and also it works with
[01:56:17] Ryden but bet doesn't which makes
[01:56:18] literally no sense and it's fine all
[01:56:20] good though
[01:56:24] same team to
[01:56:27] the oops I keep resing R to Al I don't

[02:29:50] I assume you don't need damage for a
[02:29:51] Kirara trial however let me build her
[02:29:53] just in case I think I'm going to I'm on
[02:29:55] Doan's assistant for a tanky Shield what
[02:29:57] I'm going to do though is give her a fa
[02:29:58] sword just in case I need energy and
[02:30:00] then on our build we're on deepwood
[02:30:01] memories full HP right HP HP HP
[02:30:07] um I mean it's a standard shielder build
[02:30:09] okay what do you want me to say man
[02:30:11] we're on a shielder build so like what
[02:30:14] what can I expect from a trial other
[02:30:16] than building Kirara the way she should
[02:30:18] be built which is a shield
[02:30:20] now maybe it's not that maybe you're
[02:30:22] playing like [ __ ] spread Kirara but
[02:30:24] how the [ __ ] would I know so we're going
[02:30:25] to go in on a normal build but I put her
[02:30:27] on Fab just in case just in case okay we
[02:30:29] leveled our think to 20 deepwood

[02:31:03] seen anyone do this so I actually don't
[02:31:04] know what it is but there actually seems
[02:31:06] to be a good chance that we need to
[02:31:08] bloom um collect the particles and reach
[02:31:10] the destination within the time limit so
[02:31:12] this is just run cool oh that sounds fun
[02:31:14] actually and then defeat all opponents
[02:31:16] within the time limit the challenge will
[02:31:17] be flooded with water okay we're
[02:31:19] actually looming okay I'm not joking I
