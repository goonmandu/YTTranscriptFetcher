[00:23:14] stupid doesn't matter cryo uh let's say
[00:23:16] Rosario okay good guess good guess yep
[00:23:18] okay fourth one uh let's do uh Barbara
[00:23:23] uh monster let's say Bennett Ben 10 okay
[00:23:26] okay monster uh resistance that could be
[00:23:28] the Luke that could be I think Razor's
[00:23:30] resistance but I'm not sure yes he was
[00:23:32] good guess good guess another Claymore
[00:23:34] for Monster it's not the Luke uh I don't
[00:23:37] know what book Noel does but it uses but
[00:23:39] no one does because there's Noelle okay
[00:23:40] there you go four let's let's get a
[00:23:42] fifth streak just to prove you guys that
[00:23:43] is not a fluke okay sumeru's sword okay
[00:23:46] that's [ __ ] easy it's nilu again wait
[00:23:48] there's another Sumo sword
[00:23:54] oh no Kira's from Inazuma uh
[00:23:58] [Music]
[00:24:00] uh Layla
[00:24:03] I was I don't know why I always forget
[00:24:05] Layla's from Inazuma I mean from sumeru
[00:24:07] I don't know I think it's because when
[00:24:09] she was introduced it was in the you
[00:24:10] know Zuma event with the aimiko so I
[00:24:12] associate her with the news about true
[00:24:16] see five straight told you
[00:24:23] it's Razer
[00:24:27] [ __ ] oh it's not again it's not no yeah
[00:24:29] it's literally no well
[00:24:31] how is it
[00:24:33] it was a sumeru event oh well I guess I
[00:24:36] was focused on yaimiko so it made me
[00:24:37] think of Inazuma so I'm right and you're
[00:24:39] wrong true can I get a true in the chat
[00:24:41] true true true yo
[00:24:45] yo let him look I'm about to get seven
[00:24:47] streak watch this just for you just for
[00:24:49] you a seven streak Catalyst from monstat
[00:24:51] Clee that's Barbara wait is it Barbara I
[00:24:54] just sang Barbara's no Bara uses these I
[00:24:56] think so it's uh uh Mona logic it is
[00:25:00] Mona
[00:25:01] wait does Mona does Barbara actually use
[00:25:03] those if Barbara uses those I have so
[00:25:04] much gentle knowledge it's actually
[00:25:06] scary it's actually scary it's actually
[00:25:08] scary I just guess double amounts that
[00:25:09] I'm so stupid but we find the right
[00:25:11] elements
[00:25:14] consistent smart true true I am true
[00:25:23] I meant to get ciao not changing but
[00:25:24] chengling was a better guess okay could
[00:25:27] have yet to know it's pole arm pyro pole
[00:25:29] arm no uh who the [ __ ] else who's a pyro
[00:25:34] poem other than shangling and Tomah who
[00:25:38] the [ __ ] does that third one
[00:25:39] wait why did I not
[00:25:41] uh pyro characters
[00:25:47] wait what
[00:25:48] [Music]
[00:25:53] wait I'm stupid wait let me think let me
[00:25:56] think why am I stupid
[00:25:58] [Music]
[00:26:00] yo I'm playing a pyro team right I'm
[00:26:02] trying to play pyros I have Lenny I have
[00:26:04] Bennett and then my last thought is
[00:26:06] gonna be uh I'm gonna play a pyro pole
[00:26:09] arm who would I use
[00:26:11] who would I use like dragon's Bane on
[00:26:13] changling hotel okay
[00:26:17] why did I not think of futao am I stupid
[00:26:23] I got it though I literally got it I'm
[00:26:25] still at a 9th Street
[00:26:29] who that was not pyro in my mind like
[00:26:32] ascends past every
[00:26:34] literally don't say you're done I
[00:26:36] literally got it don't be mad I
[00:26:37] literally got it I thought the thing
[00:26:38] because when I think of pyro characters
[00:26:40] I'm thinking of like supports that I
[00:26:42] Chuck in a team I'm not thinking of you
[00:26:44] that without a transcends look I even
[00:26:46] hutao loves me so much she gave me butau
[00:26:48] true look even lights up
[00:26:50] true

[00:27:04] right
[00:27:05] I'm stuck in a quick shot yeah that's
[00:27:07] diligence okay that's what I thought
[00:27:09] um
[00:27:12] I'm just gonna guess
[00:27:16] wait am I gonna lose wait
[00:27:20] wait let me think

[00:30:00] [ __ ] I'm in Japanese
[00:30:02] whatever
[00:30:06] uh come on
[00:30:11] hey he didn't see you there he
[00:30:14] he
[00:30:21] he posts this
[00:30:28] who's the guy on the bottom left
[00:30:31] oh glad you asked so I'm like probably
[00:30:35] not just the tallest gun distributor but
[00:30:37] also just tallest streamer in general
[00:30:38] did I just get donor walled by a four
[00:30:41] feet eleven wait what happened thanks
[00:30:42] for the busy sir
[00:30:45] 10 months
[00:30:48] um I saw something confused are you
[00:30:49] actually a law student if not why aren't
[00:30:50] you concerned of your digital footprint
[00:30:52] that's a myth that doesn't exist
[00:30:56] that's a myth kind of like kind of like
[00:31:00] dinosaurs
[00:31:02] thank you
[00:31:09] how to play hutau with yolan and sing
[00:31:11] Cho just charge attack
[00:31:14] you want to do two normals into charge
[00:31:16] attack usually you do
[00:31:18] and then you if you're c0 you can jump
[00:31:20] cancel if you're C1 you can Dash cancel
[00:31:22] uh and if you sometimes you don't need
[00:31:25] to cancel if you want to like go through
[00:31:26] two enemies at the same time you're
[00:31:28] welcome
[00:31:35] if you're c0 run a shield as the last
[00:31:37] law so you don't get [ __ ] if you're C1
[00:31:39] you can also run a shield or you can go
[00:31:40] shangling because when you use
[00:31:42] shanglings Elemental burst pyro NATO uh
[00:31:45] shangling actually calls upon the god of
[00:31:47] pyro whose name is Johnson uh and then
[00:31:50] Johnson's pyronado will one shot
[00:31:52] everything and also vaporize because you
[00:31:53] have a lot of hydro
[00:31:58] okay
[00:31:59] yeah we play music
[00:32:04] we're gonna musical Journey so this
[00:32:05] could be literally anything oh French
[00:32:07] music w
[00:32:09] all right
[00:32:11] so as I explained last stream
[00:32:16] we did get an anonymous donation
[00:32:20] um Anonymous donation of around 1600
[00:32:22] resin thirteen hundred sorry wait
[00:32:25] it could be higher one second speaking
[00:32:27] of xiangling Charlie socks will play to
[00:32:29] our taglia for once
[00:32:33] I can chat it should be higher one sec
[00:32:35] the donation was actually higher I just
[00:32:37] I misclicked
[00:32:38] okay
[00:32:43] uh we did get an anonymous origination
[00:32:45] of about 1600 resin now it's not it's
[00:32:48] not like it's anonymous because I but
[00:32:50] let's just say the person who gave it
[00:32:52] rhymes with baby what that sounds
[00:32:55] it was Jay-Z but it's because I was I
[00:32:58] went to New York City I he said hazox
[00:33:00] long time since we we met uh I want to
[00:33:02] thank you again for putting me on the
[00:33:04] map uh that is why initially my name was
[00:33:06] just Jay I put the Z there out in honor
[00:33:09] out of you uh with respect to you
[00:33:11] because of everything you've done for me
[00:33:12] and my family obviously I don't brag
[00:33:14] about it because I'm humble and why
[00:33:16] would I say stuff like that there's no
[00:33:18] reason to it's weird it's not relatable
[00:33:19] so I just spare I'm sparing the details
[00:33:22] but let's just say an anonymous donor
[00:33:24] gave us some resin so it is what it is
[00:33:26] and that's why we have them some for
[00:33:27] today so
[00:33:29] starting now
[00:33:32] what we're going to be doing today is
[00:33:33] the following
[00:33:39] we're going to be continuing the resin
[00:33:40] spending of our last stream here
[00:33:43] for a total of five to seven thousand
[00:33:45] resin I'll calculate it after it'll be
[00:33:47] somewhere around there
[00:33:50] um and then after that we're gonna
[00:33:52] hopefully have pieces for Linney navient
[00:33:54] official maybe how would I know maybe
[00:33:56] Risley listen you guys gonna be like
[00:33:58] sucks how would he know listen he
[00:34:00] probably is gonna need a new domain okay
[00:34:01] shut the [ __ ] up don't type susk I just
[00:34:04] assume he will okay how would I know I'm
[00:34:06] just guessing [ __ ] you also probably the
[00:34:08] Arkham do uh and then we're gonna do
[00:34:10] official run with the new set because I
[00:34:13] made a new visual guide but I don't have
[00:34:15] footage with a new set because I don't
[00:34:16] have the new set so once I get it we'll
[00:34:17] go there cool so right now we're gonna
[00:34:20] record the like mini intro of day two
[00:34:23] because technically in video stuff it's
[00:34:26] gonna be day one and then it's gonna
[00:34:27] transition to now which is day two so

[00:35:02] it is now a new day day two I have a new
[00:35:04] shirt
[00:35:08] and we're gonna spend the rest of our
[00:35:09] five to seven thousand resin I don't

[00:35:24] and still 43 fragiles
[00:35:29] um so yeah we're gonna spend like
[00:35:30] basically all of that
[00:35:32] because it they won you know I got tired
[00:35:34] after like four hours day two we're
[00:35:36] gonna have better pieces oh wait Did We
[00:35:38] Roll yeah we did roll the other ones
[00:35:39] okay yeah what was the best I have so
[00:35:41] far
[00:35:48] I mean I mean yo HBO yo okay oh this is
[00:35:53] good wait this is actually good I can
[00:35:54] submit my friends
[00:35:56] I forgot oh
[00:35:59] my God
[00:36:01] it's okay
[00:36:02] wait what was that don't know can't wait
[00:36:04] for you to account reviews yes we will
[00:36:08] this week no copium
[00:36:14] oh also so you guys know the plan is
[00:36:16] where you need to build Lenny and Fishel
[00:36:18] zai zero X certainly is one of my
[00:36:21] favorites of all time okay shut the [ __ ]
[00:36:23] up you're throwing away my my thought
[00:36:24] process gets interrupted uh and also
[00:36:27] like yeah I
[00:36:29] but
[00:36:31] if we got a good amiibo goblet we could
[00:36:33] use it on travel as well and then the
[00:36:34] extra pieces we're gonna strongbox
[00:36:36] Vermillion either probably an extreme or
[00:36:38] sometime when we're done
[00:36:41] dude your characters are probably gonna
[00:36:42] need this maybe not yet maybe archon
[00:36:44] maybe [ __ ] Risley I don't know but
[00:36:46] probably so
[00:36:48] what I can do is if this video delayed
[00:36:50] is we can turn it into a farming for a
[00:36:52] new character if we know what they do so
[00:36:54] then it's not leaks because it we don't
[00:36:55] talk about leaks here true okay anyways
[00:36:57] we're gonna uh I'm just guess dude dude
[00:37:00] the dendro domain is
[00:37:02] I never needed the [ __ ] emblem domain
[00:37:03] in [ __ ] Inazuma so ratio also ziox
[00:37:07] shouldn't you do the archon quest before
[00:37:08] the reek resets surely you're not going
[00:37:10] to miss a week of [ __ ] reputation and
[00:37:12] [ __ ] [ __ ] you okay [ __ ] you we'll do the
[00:37:14] r Conquest next stream or into maybe I
[00:37:17] don't know this week [ __ ] you all right
[00:37:18] let's just do the the Numa of sin
[00:37:24] official isn't [ __ ] well official is
[00:37:27] cool until she speaks then she's cringe
[00:37:29] but then you hear Oz speak and Oz is a
[00:37:31] Chad so he's cool and it makes up for it
[00:37:32] true true
[00:37:35] um I want to play Kazo but I need
[00:37:36] friendship on characters so we might
[00:37:38] just bring baiju in here yeah he started
[00:37:42] so mean to her listen I like Fishel but
[00:37:45] listen to her literally listen to her am
[00:37:48] I in English or Japanese
[00:37:50] oh well you can't really listen to her
[00:37:51] but whatever
[00:37:56] I official Am The Princess and the
[00:38:01] do not be mean to official dude I love
[00:38:03] official
[00:38:05] I think visual's sick but she is a
[00:38:07] little annoying
[00:38:12] unbased opinion dude I
[00:38:17] never mind official could do no wrong
[00:38:24] no oh okay do you guys want to know do
[00:38:26] you want to know the worst part
[00:38:28] of my account not just my account of
[00:38:31] like this video of everything of being a
[00:38:33] [ __ ] streaming and being content
[00:38:35] driven okay
[00:38:36] look
[00:38:38] I I literally I haven't played getting
[00:38:41] in like five well I mean I streamed
[00:38:43] engine but I basically like I have to
[00:38:44] travel for a little bit to helping move
[00:38:46] and so I haven't really gotten to play
[00:38:48] much so I've been saving my resin the
[00:38:50] donation from a mysterious viewer for
[00:38:52] like five days which means I haven't got
[00:38:55] into Farm Talent books I haven't gone to
[00:38:57] suspend my natural resin matter of fact
[00:38:58] anyone anyone anyone being like yo how
[00:39:01] does he have so much resin this hurts me
[00:39:03] it literally would have been let I would
[00:39:05] have had more resin if I just spent
[00:39:06] resin naturally instead of saving it up
[00:39:09] but I didn't want to spend any resinol
[00:39:11] stream
[00:39:12] so I love you guys so much that I saved
[00:39:15] it for you guys the only painful part is
[00:39:18] that now I can't like spend resin on
[00:39:20] Lenny's talents or Lynette or like
[00:39:22] leveling her we almost have it because I
[00:39:25] needed to save my resin for the stream
[00:39:27] But like after the stream I can like
[00:39:28] look I literally only need one boss so
[00:39:29] true
[00:39:35] wait let me get ready to timestamp stuff
[00:39:37] so editor doesn't have to watch the
[00:39:39] entire [ __ ] vlog
[00:39:43] uh because if I do that if I make editor
[00:39:46] watch the entire VOD they will go insane
[00:39:48] because doctors say they prescribe My
[00:39:51] Stream because I'm actually uh a medical
[00:39:56] yeah I can probably get sued for saying
[00:39:58] that they prescribe My Stream because
[00:39:59] I'm like I'm I'm therapeutic however
[00:40:02] uh if you watch too much of it you go
[00:40:04] insane so you're watching moderation
[00:40:08] okay first round of money
[00:40:10] also I farm Crystal flies true watch
[00:40:12] this oh not bad
[00:40:14] oh wait
[00:40:16] wait okay we don't
[00:40:18] feed but what if oh I am Hydro I need HP
[00:40:23] and crit oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] maybe we don't
[00:40:27] know we actually don't know it's too
[00:40:28] early but this is gonna be really good
[00:40:31] yo
[00:40:34] okay we're gonna level this later
[00:40:36] dude crit crit attack HB
[00:40:43] wait a second
[00:40:45] this could be good worst case it's like
[00:40:47] a lot of fees
[00:40:56] that's [ __ ] sick
[00:40:59] but
[00:41:04] do you see the cafe bug yeah
[00:41:06] um yeah I don't know if we're gonna
[00:41:09] Co-op today
[00:41:11] I definitely did see the cafe bug
[00:41:28] it's a hack yeah apparently it's like
[00:41:30] with if you like well not if you because
[00:41:32] you shouldn't do this but people like
[00:41:34] can like hack their clients somehow and
[00:41:37] then make it to where cave can
[00:41:39] permanently delete something in your
[00:41:40] world that you can interact with so like
[00:41:42] a [ __ ] domain tree or something
[00:41:45] and it's like permanent to the point
[00:41:47] where even if you like reinstall your
[00:41:49] game
[00:41:50] yeah
[00:41:52] isn't it a prank I don't know it doesn't
[00:41:53] really matter
[00:41:58] because if people do that they get
[00:41:59] banned right so it's like
[00:42:07] is it fake hopefully it's fake
[00:42:12] oh this could be good if you guys for
[00:42:14] damage this could also be good if it
[00:42:15] gets Critter rate we'll keep those
[00:42:21] happy anniversary delete Dory
[00:42:30] yeah I don't know
[00:42:35] could be real could be fake if it's fake
[00:42:37] then whoever started it has the sense of
[00:42:39] humor of a [ __ ] child just just so
[00:42:41] you know
[00:42:55] it's 100 not fake
[00:42:58] oh there you go
[00:43:00] I am believing chatters
[00:43:10] bug wait I kind of did is it still does
[00:43:14] it still work
[00:43:17] did they patch yet
[00:43:19] oh they patched it
[00:43:21] patch how do they patch the most
[00:43:24] poisonous [ __ ] so fast
[00:43:26] they imagine it within like a day
[00:43:30] surely they patched my account to get
[00:43:32] good [ __ ] Vermillion pieces
[00:43:35] surely they patched well that's fine
[00:43:45] wait why didn't they just why did they
[00:43:47] just patch ventially all to not suck
[00:43:49] artifacts off the map True just make it
[00:43:51] to where venti's alt can't stock
[00:43:53] artifacts or like
[00:43:55] in Co-op it doesn't suck items or the
[00:43:57] other person's items you can lose your
[00:43:59] own because if you're dumb enough to do
[00:44:00] that then you deserve it boom and then
[00:44:02] we can leave [ __ ] the old domains
[00:44:03] where [ __ ] all the [ __ ] would be on the
[00:44:05] ground and then it looks way better
[00:44:14] okay I don't talk about this run I don't
[00:44:16] know what just happened
[00:44:21] it's supposed to suck items okay why the
[00:44:24] [ __ ] would it have to suck items and
[00:44:26] Co-op
[00:44:27] just make it suck your items not the
[00:44:28] [ __ ]
[00:44:30] the other dude's items you're welcome
[00:44:52] this is certainly a team this is
[00:44:54] certainly one of the teams of all time
[00:45:16] feels like watching Envy artifact run
[00:45:18] okay what does that I'm sure Envy
[00:45:20] doesn't mean clear bad
[00:45:22] why are you guys flaming both of us
[00:45:24] also look look if my clear's a bad
[00:45:27] explain this explain this if my clears

[00:45:53] okay well this team is listening
[00:46:04] dude if I was a new viewer if I hadn't
[00:46:06] seen Lenny until watching my stream I

[00:46:12] time

[00:56:19] gonna throw the other dude then watch
[00:56:20] this Showtime
[00:56:22] it's not show time I'm [ __ ]
[00:56:27] when is it gonna be Showtime man I just
[00:56:29] want it to be Showtime
[00:56:32] please please I don't ask him much I
[00:56:35] don't ask much of you Lenny but please
[00:56:37] please show time
[00:56:43] it's showtime chat
[00:56:54] It's Showtime Showtime
[00:56:58] well I don't know how condensed
[00:57:05] you make me want to pull him but I'm
[00:57:07] saving for clorindi dude is gonna come
[00:57:10] out in [ __ ] six years you have time
[00:57:11] to get Primo gems just submit and pull
[00:57:13] true succumb and pull true true don't be
[00:57:16] responsible spend Primo gems
[00:57:19] that's not true please save your save
[00:57:20] your gems if you don't want you don't
[00:57:22] need them I mean he's cool he's fun he's
[00:57:23] pretty strong you don't need save if you
[00:57:25] want
[00:57:29] well okay kind of okay
[00:57:31] so the reason I say save is because
[00:57:33] mystically you're probably gonna want
[00:57:35] like like realistically you're probably
[00:57:36] gonna want [ __ ] like either navient
[00:57:38] or Risley or Fontan Arcon or [ __ ]
[00:57:42] another character so odds are
[00:57:45] you're gonna not have enough female gems
[00:57:46] but if you want if you only want two
[00:57:48] characters you'll probably be able to
[00:57:50] especially if the second one is far
[00:57:51] because there's a lot of Primos that
[00:57:53] come with the new region
[00:57:54] but you might just get super unlucky and
[00:57:57] then rip Bozo so yeah
[00:58:05] [Music]
[00:58:14] build is
[00:58:17] okay I got you just because it's Fontan
[00:58:19] patch I got you uh so she's on Homa
[00:58:23] she's on forkers which Elsa might
[00:58:25] reminiscence build is better but I don't
[00:58:27] like using it so I'm on my Crimson
[00:58:29] witchfield uh we're usually on this
[00:58:31] flower but it's on linear right now
[00:58:32] amazing uh our feather is this one our
[00:58:35] Sans it's pretty good you know some em a
[00:58:37] lot of crit it could be better but it's
[00:58:39] pretty good uh our goblet is that and
[00:58:41] our circlet is that now I don't think I
[00:58:42] have enough em so I could go for uh this
[00:58:45] goblet that gives me more em to make it
[00:58:47] to where I have one six well what I mean
[00:58:49] I think that one's better actually and
[00:58:51] when I cooked
[00:58:53] so like
[00:58:57] pretty decent pretty decent with HP
[00:58:59] sounds pretty good
[00:59:00] uh My Romance is better though but yeah
[00:59:03] that's why no one asked
[00:59:05] [Music]
[00:59:13] that is French phobic
[00:59:15] please apologize
[00:59:18] stop
[00:59:23] shut the [ __ ] up no one cares get better
[00:59:26] do better
[00:59:29] that's not really true I mean like I
[00:59:30] guess it does matter well no it doesn't
[00:59:32] matter but
[00:59:33] it's a natural comparison to make
[00:59:35] the same [ __ ] characters
[00:59:38] um one vaporizes one's monopiro play
[00:59:40] your favorite
[00:59:42] somebody
[00:59:57] else
[00:59:59] show time waiting I will see
[01:00:03] that's not Showtime I'm sorry
[01:00:12] realistically though did Yulie after
[01:00:14] that too when we were at the [ __ ]
[01:00:15] exit he literally asked me do you think
[01:00:17] Lenny's better than hyperbloom and then
[01:00:19] he's like do you think Lenny's better
[01:00:20] than hutau and I'm like dude why do you
[01:00:22] sound like twitch chat right now why are
[01:00:24] you quizzing me like that
[01:00:27] like the the real answer is probably
[01:00:29] like wait for DPS calcs but like it
[01:00:31] realistically it's like do you have
[01:00:33] shangling Bennett Cosmosphere or do you
[01:00:35] have singtel spare do you have Synchro
[01:00:37] spare Plato if you have Bennett and like
[01:00:39] either changling or Kazo or zhangri or
[01:00:41] Deus bear then play well not really Dale
[01:00:42] but you can then play Lenny and then
[01:00:45] Lenny's a bit more
[01:00:46] um
[01:00:47] I like Lenny a bit more than um
[01:00:51] some things that are have less AOE kind
[01:00:53] of like hyperloom okay hyperloom's a lot
[01:00:55] easier to build like everyone can play
[01:00:56] hyperboom I think that's like the beauty
[01:00:57] of hyperloom it's like if you could make
[01:00:58] a hyperloom team out of like basically
[01:01:00] nothing uh and it's very easy to use and
[01:01:02] like pretty strong like you get a lot of
[01:01:04] value out of it with like nothing but
[01:01:05] what I like about lineal more is like he
[01:01:08] feels like even though he's a single
[01:01:10] Target DPS primarily you kind of have
[01:01:12] AOE because of his teams like and you
[01:01:16] it's not like let's say you're in an
[01:01:17] alien situation you can kind of do like
[01:01:19] not a lot of char trots you can
[01:01:20] literally like normal attack burst and
[01:01:23] then like swap to other characters and
[01:01:24] you kind of quick okay well I didn't
[01:01:25] create anything but you kind of quick
[01:01:26] swap with him and then you can clearly
[01:01:27] stuff so it feels a lot nicer than like
[01:01:29] someone who's purely single Target
[01:01:32] and like
[01:01:34] for example okay
[01:01:39] she has some AOE like you can Dash to
[01:01:41] enemies you can like burst and stuff but
[01:01:42] like her support are like sincho yolan
[01:01:45] and sexual Elon don't have AOE like very
[01:01:48] very little so it's like if you are an
[01:01:50] AOE content yeah hutao can do some but
[01:01:53] unless you're playing like shangling or
[01:01:54] something it's like you don't have that
[01:01:55] much but like Lenny's teams are usually
[01:01:57] like kazua Bennett changling so it's
[01:01:59] like you have a lot just from like your
[01:02:01] team
[01:02:03] nerd how is he still going dude I'm
[01:02:06] sorry oh
[01:02:08] if this gets crit damage I will
[01:02:12] redacted
[01:02:14] could be good
[01:02:20] all timestamp that fine
[01:02:30] who would use that susk okay there's for
[01:02:33] sure a new Hydro character that's gonna
[01:02:34] use something in the new Hydro domain
[01:02:36] okay shut the [ __ ] up it's not even susk
[01:02:38] okay it's at some point surely
[01:02:51] you guys are typing sus it confirms that
[01:02:53] what I'm saying is true
[01:03:02] please be Showtime please
[01:03:07] it's your time
[01:03:09] well I actually hit that what the [ __ ]
[01:03:11] one more one more one more
[01:03:16] well I hit that wait maybe not I don't
[01:03:18] know

[01:04:02] however
[01:04:03] keep in mind
[01:04:04] that unless I'm mistaken the next weapon
[01:04:07] Banner is going to be child and John Lee
[01:04:09] so you're gonna get Polar Star maybe but
[01:04:11] you might also get Vortex vanquisher and
[01:04:13] no disrespect to Vortex vanquisher it's
[01:04:16] a fine attack stick right
[01:04:18] but if you want a bow for child
[01:04:21] and you love your your tartaglia then
[01:04:23] why don't you pull on the [ __ ] double
[01:04:25] bow Banner where you literally can't
[01:04:27] lose unless you [ __ ] get a off-bander
[01:04:29] weapon
[01:04:31] dude they're both amazing why don't you
[01:04:34] just pull on this
[01:04:40] don't you'll get Amos
[01:04:51] the only the only downside with of uh
[01:04:54] the first great magic with child is in
[01:04:56] international you only get uh since
[01:04:58] you're not running another Hydro you're
[01:05:00] only getting 16 attack but then you're
[01:05:02] getting a bunch of movement speeds so I
[01:05:04] mean it's funny I guess but the charge
[01:05:05] hack isn't bad for and then it's bow of
[01:05:07] homo and then Amos is like insane so
[01:05:10] [ __ ] good don't look at me okay
[01:05:17] I'm so stupid I said Amos uh [ __ ]
[01:05:21] okay now this is aqua is insane not Amos
[01:05:24] Amos is Amos Is Not Great Aqua Cindy
[01:05:27] Locker is insane not Amos I oh
[01:05:42] insane copium no it is Amos is great I
[01:05:46] think Amos is a really good pull for
[01:05:48] basically every Bowser that's not a uh
[01:05:51] yolan I mean like what the [ __ ] dogs
[01:05:53] it's literally a long signature okay but
[01:05:55] you know what yolon's actual signature
[01:05:56] is [ __ ] elegy and Fab and just use
[01:05:59] the ER weapon and then have a good life
[01:06:00] happy life and then give Amos uh not
[01:06:02] Amos I [ __ ] I keep saying
[01:06:05] what is it called Eloy aqua and then
[01:06:08] give Aqua to a [ __ ] someone that
[01:06:10] wants crit
[01:06:12] and then give Yolanda like a [ __ ] ER
[01:06:14] weapon so that she's not hating her life
[01:06:16] and then fav is Loki better for your
[01:06:18] team and LG's Loki better for your team
[01:06:20] you're welcome
[01:06:27] dude I keep saying [ __ ] Amos dude I
[01:06:30] need to remove
[01:06:32] uh I mean it has attack it has could
[01:06:34] rate their low rolls but it could be
[01:06:37] good
[01:06:37] oh but the only problem is now this has
[01:06:39] to be in the video because if I get this
[01:06:41] and I'm talking about what I was talking
[01:06:42] about then
[01:06:45] how would I even edit that
[01:06:51] what's up Emmy
[01:06:54] let me do a new reaction
[01:06:56] oh this could be good I can I mean it
[01:06:59] could be good whatever
[01:07:10] can you check JP Lynette's heavy hit
[01:07:12] voice line no because every character
[01:07:14] when they take a heavy hit they're like
[01:07:16] and I don't want to listen to that on
[01:07:17] screen right now I'm sorry I don't I
[01:07:19] actually don't I don't I don't want to
[01:07:20] do that to you or to me I don't want to
[01:07:22] do that I'm sorry we're not gonna listen
[01:07:24] to it
[01:07:26] you know what we will but if it's what I
[01:07:28] think it is you're getting bad 24 hour
[01:07:29] timeout
[01:07:35] yeah okay mods find them yeah I [ __ ]
[01:07:39] knew it I literally [ __ ] knew it I
[01:07:42] [ __ ] knew it I [ __ ] knew it I
[01:07:44] didn't mean to press you on the knee
[01:07:49] foreign
[01:07:54] did I just miss it
[01:08:06] I like how um
[01:08:14] dude I got one shot in
[01:08:20] it
[01:08:27] foreign
[01:08:48] who else thinks we need our Showtime
[01:08:50] emote
[01:08:52] uh we could but I don't know what it
[01:08:54] would be here
[01:08:58] minus 31 months die zero x heart updated
[01:09:01] dilute guide when in coping
[01:09:17] chatting
[01:09:19] it could be him bowing or something yeah
[01:09:21] but I'm not gonna make an emote
[01:09:23] I'm only um I've made two emotes I made
[01:09:25] Eula and I made Dory
[01:09:28] this is like well it's not really made I
[01:09:30] just well Eula I did make Dory I just
[01:09:32] like joined an image but like you lied I
[01:09:34] cropped that [ __ ] myself
[01:09:39] which one better on your lawn
[01:09:43] Savage father's really nice it helps
[01:09:45] with your energy it helps your team with
[01:09:47] energy it's really good it's also free
[01:09:49] to play you can get one for free by
[01:09:50] doing uh early quest
[01:09:57] gifted what the [ __ ]
[01:10:02] insane
[01:10:03] thank you
[01:10:06] even C1 yalon yeah probably because C1
[01:10:09] like gilan's damage is mostly reverse
[01:10:10] like yes C1 will give you an extra
[01:10:12] charge so a little bit more damage once
[01:10:13] per fight maybe two if your rotations I
[01:10:15] actually don't know how it lines up with
[01:10:16] the rotations but it's that's not really
[01:10:19] the main point of stringless If You're
[01:10:20] Gonna Play stringless it's mostly for
[01:10:21] your burst damage and then the en is
[01:10:22] kind of wasted because you're not really
[01:10:23] procking reactions on her usually
[01:10:27] oh yeah
[01:10:28] so like five would still help but then
[01:10:30] even if you're like okay but with C1 I
[01:10:32] have more E's so more I need less energy
[01:10:34] true but at that point it's like okay if
[01:10:36] you need less energy then like just go
[01:10:39] HP Sands and [ __ ] and then Fab will give
[01:10:41] you enough
[01:10:44] so five is really good
[01:10:51] show time
[01:10:52] it's not show time
[01:11:02] well August happened today it'll be this
[01:11:04] week or your money back guaranteed not
[01:11:07] redo
[01:11:09] it's like [ __ ] eight hours dude it's
[01:11:11] gonna be so long I'm actually afraid I
[01:11:13] don't know if I'll have to split it in
[01:11:14] two or not it's gonna be good
[01:11:22] you said this week last week okay true
[01:11:24] but no copium now
[01:11:27] Lynette's normal attacks sound like Five
[01:11:29] Nights at Freddy's what
[01:11:39] okay you're too young to be on Twitch
[01:11:41] I'm sorry like we're gonna have to bend
[01:11:42] you for that like you're
[01:11:44] like for your own set like I don't think
[01:11:46] you're allowed on twitch under the age
[01:11:48] of like 13.
[01:11:58] they do
[01:12:11] uh I mean I don't know about that one
[01:12:13] I'm gonna be honest
[01:12:19] let me listen let me listen
[01:12:23] okay I don't know this is I'm not gonna
[01:12:25] entertain this idea
[01:12:28] castling to animations spam it
[01:12:39] thank you
[01:12:41] I don't know uh I'm not Degen enough for
[01:12:45] that
[01:12:52] um
[01:12:59] you look good
[01:13:13] I don't know
[01:13:18] do our group wasn't English because I
[01:13:20] don't like having to read as much
[01:13:22] like I read the text but I I don't know
[01:13:25] sometimes I want to just not read it
[01:13:37] what about monohydro with Synchro yolan
[01:13:40] Lynette and Barbara on field
[01:13:46] why
[01:13:58] we go
[01:14:07] why not I mean
[01:14:10] true I guess
[01:14:15] the problem the problem with the Hydra
[01:14:17] like
[01:14:18] monohydro in this economy is like
[01:14:20] hydro's like the best reactions it's
[01:14:22] like just [ __ ] put it put an electric
[01:14:23] character put it down to a character put
[01:14:25] a pyro character
[01:14:41] what about Mono Animo
[01:14:45] good
[01:14:48] mono Animo chat I mean Loki Xiao Kana
[01:14:52] plays that yeah I guess never mind I
[01:14:54] just I just said ciao
[01:14:56] Nemo
[01:15:02] what about monodendro okay but that is
[01:15:05] actually stupid because you literally
[01:15:07] keep the dendril on the enemy with if
[01:15:09] even if you have Electro
[01:15:13] and he was actually stupid though
[01:15:21] I didn't swirl this guy
[01:15:26] how are you liking Lenny I love him when
[01:15:28] he says it's showtime when he doesn't
[01:15:29] it's kind of whatever
[01:15:45] dude can can she [ __ ] Groove yes or
[01:15:48] no
[01:15:53] what is
[01:15:54] I guess she's getting taunted but
[01:15:57] okay
[01:16:02] they just vaporized me
[01:16:10] dude dude dude dude dude
[01:16:17] well I thought that would kill I thought
[01:16:19] okay well I should have shot her
[01:16:24] hey sauce are there any good pyro 4
[01:16:26] stars available at genjen yet wow I'm
[01:16:29] glad first time chatter asked that
[01:16:31] question uh boy do I have the character
[01:16:33] for you imagine a character who could
[01:16:35] use not just a ton of different artifact
[01:16:38] sets notably the most efficient one to
[01:16:40] farm in the game this could be good but
[01:16:43] also uh imagine if that character could
[01:16:46] additionally use a free-to-play 4 star
[01:16:50] pull arm that you could fish and refine
[01:16:52] for free that is one of her best weapons
[01:16:55] on par with some 5 Stars while also
[01:16:57] having Synergy with another four-star
[01:16:59] character that we're getting for free
[01:17:00] this event with that four star also
[01:17:03] being free anytime through the abyss who
[01:17:06] also has no ICD on her burst and a very
[01:17:09] high scaling on an ability that you can
[01:17:11] vaporize
[01:17:14] that would be great if that was real
[01:17:30] it's it's not too much Toma is not free
[01:17:44] [ __ ]
[01:17:47] I'm sad
[01:17:56] accidentally
[01:18:09] demons
[01:18:14] what is this character design
[01:18:20] I'm now that Lily's bull looks good on
[01:18:22] tanari does it
[01:18:25] isn't it like purple and red
[01:18:33] um
[01:18:35] I mean there was a statement made about
[01:18:37] tanari's design or like his colors that
[01:18:41] um that said that uh every single weapon
[01:18:44] in the game matches at least one of the
[01:18:46] colors in his design because he has
[01:18:47] every [ __ ] color on him so it's
[01:18:49] probably true like he literally has a
[01:18:52] matching color with every bow
[01:18:58] but yeah
[01:19:09] foreign
[01:19:30] doesn't have Calamity why the [ __ ] would
[01:19:33] a xiaomi need calamity
[01:19:36] what
[01:19:37] the [ __ ] would I need calamity queller

[01:20:25] easy for us I think it's starting to be
[01:20:27] too easy even with friendship characters
[01:20:29] I think we're so good that like I could
[01:20:32] probably do this blindfolded
[01:20:34] even with a chart-shotting character I
[01:20:36] could do with my eyes closed
[01:20:45] no you can't okay well I'd probably want

[01:42:26] fur
[01:42:27] vote

[01:44:47] low-key my favorite team but I want any
[01:44:49] to win always because na loses in every
[01:44:51] game ever and it's probably a matter of
[01:44:53] time till they lose invalid too like
[01:44:54] every year but for now I'm just like my
[01:44:57] priority is like the teams I like no n a
[01:44:59] and then the teams I like
[01:45:04] I have to do we have to win something
[01:45:06] and it has nothing else
[01:45:08] I got crit rate plus damage feather a
[01:45:13] if you

[01:48:12] on something on like their taskbar by
[01:48:13] accident instead of clicking back into
[01:48:15] the gunshin and then they like launches
[01:48:17] something that takes five hours to load
[01:48:18] and then your whole PC starts lagging
[01:48:20] and then you're like waiting for that
[01:48:21] thing to load so you can close it
[01:48:22] because I just did that and
[01:48:25] no okay well it's like when you
[01:48:27] accidentally open Microsoft's word and
[01:48:28] then your whole computer starts freaking
[01:48:30] out or you accidentally open and then
[01:48:33] there's the pop-ups like active please
[01:48:34] activate Microsoft Word or like when you
[01:48:36] try to move a picture around in [ __ ]
[01:48:38] Ms word and then it's like you'll move
[01:48:40] it and it'll [ __ ] all of your texts
[01:48:42] because it's designed in like 1994.
[01:48:51] foreign
[01:49:09] this enemy doesn't have a weak spot does

[01:49:19] shoulders

[01:49:30] motion 0.25 speed play-by-play 4K HD
[01:49:35] Replay that did not miss
[01:49:37] I think that's the first bullet uh first
[01:49:39] shot inaccuracy or something because
[01:49:40] that actually hit
[01:49:51] we are playing bird Jake Lenny
[01:49:55] God forbid girls take a sippy of their
[01:49:57] water
[01:49:58] why don't you
[01:50:03] um actually
[01:50:22] sounds that harassment
[01:50:26] you forgot to claim no oh dude no
[01:50:36] I do not want to talk
[01:50:42] y'all let's distract the children yo oh
[01:50:45] my God I can't believe we're pulling
[01:50:46] okay can we get something
[01:50:49] the big Club
[01:50:51] you've heard of the big Club okay but
[01:50:53] have you heard of have you heard of its
[01:50:55] successor its father actually the
[01:50:58] Talking Stick
[01:50:59] trope
[01:51:08] dude Talking Stick is so bad
[01:51:14] its effect is so Niche that I'm like
[01:51:16] okay you know maybe there's like some
[01:51:18] specific character coming in like 4.8
[01:51:20] that it's designed for but at the same
[01:51:22] time it's like even if the whole effect
[01:51:25] works it's like
[01:51:26] still probably not better than [ __ ]
[01:51:28] serpent spine
[01:51:30] so I uh
[01:51:35] Hey where's my Co-op teammate
[01:51:38] okay I'm not even gonna ask
[01:51:45] please be Showtime please Lenny please
[01:52:00] where the [ __ ] uh mind them
[01:52:07] wait Chad you know these guys have like
[01:52:09] the pneumonia thing or the Numa thing
[01:52:12] like on their shoulder what happens if I
[01:52:13] we see them
[01:52:24] so I've done it with Lynette but I've
[01:52:27] never really noticed anything like I
[01:52:28] don't actually know what happens what
[01:52:30] [ __ ] dude
[01:52:35] there's stunned a bit oh I see okay good
[01:52:39] to know
[01:52:43] you sell them for a singular second
[01:52:44] their attacks are less aggressive oh I
[01:52:47] mean if they're in the abyss that would
[01:52:48] probably matter a lot more because
[01:52:49] they'd be like a lot more annoying and
[01:52:51] harder
[01:52:53] they lose their Elemental attacks okay
[01:52:55] okay that makes sense
[01:52:57] I mean we can we can try it like I don't
[01:52:59] know if you guys are just trolling me
[01:53:00] but
[01:53:01] because sometimes channels say like good
[01:53:02] stuff and as long as they'll just say
[01:53:03] random [ __ ] and I'll believe them and
[01:53:05] then it'll just be wrong

[02:00:13] did I miss
[02:00:22] it's with Lenny oh so it's Numa it's not
[02:00:25] Lucia okay
[02:00:28] I didn't know the colors I thought
[02:00:31] wait why do I think the colors with
[02:00:32] others I thought purple was
[02:00:36] pneuma but that means purple's Lucia and
[02:00:37] you want to use Numa on purple I thought
[02:00:40] the colors are different okay my bad
[02:00:43] I know you have to hit with the opposite
[02:00:45] I know that I just thought that
[02:00:47] um
[02:00:48] I didn't know what color pneumo like I
[02:00:50] know you use white on purple or whatever
[02:00:52] the [ __ ] like light on dark but I didn't
[02:00:54] know that light I thought light was the
[02:00:56] other one I thought light was
[02:00:59] but I guess that means light is pneuma
[02:01:02] I don't know I don't know yeah
[02:01:05] like I know you use Numa for Sia Lucia
[02:01:08] for Numa but I don't know which one was
[02:01:10] new man which one was here so yeah I get
[02:01:12] I guess Numa is the light one
[02:01:17] [Music]
[02:01:20] scratch dumb wait dude I'm not even
[02:01:24] gonna respond to that
[02:01:33] where's Lenny's best and Slot bow I have
[02:01:35] not pulled for it
[02:01:37] it's pretty cool I like it
[02:01:39] um this batter is tempting but I think I
[02:01:41] would only pull on this Banner if I
[02:01:43] wasn't super excited for navient Risley
[02:01:47] Farina and also
[02:01:50] um [ __ ] chlorine and because I like
[02:01:53] those all of those characters there's a
[02:01:55] decent chance I'm gonna pull for one or
[02:01:57] two of their weapons and because and I
[02:01:59] don't want to have like every five star
[02:02:00] weapon because then people like dude
[02:02:02] you're such a dude your inventory is so
[02:02:04] unrelatable so we're gonna wait
[02:02:16] boom
[02:02:17] I haven't gotten a single good piece in
[02:02:20] Co-op okay it's actually like a sign
[02:02:22] dude
[02:02:23] it's okay
[02:02:31] you're already not relatable I mean I
[02:02:33] know but I pull so the way it is I only
[02:02:36] pull weapons for like my favorite
[02:02:37] characters or if the weapon's insane for
[02:02:39] example like a support weapon that's
[02:02:41] like really nice for like a lot of
[02:02:43] different stuff I'll get and like my my
[02:02:46] favorite characters all get their
[02:02:47] weapons right but like okay well he
[02:02:49] doesn't have [ __ ] Lo-Fi on but like
[02:02:50] I'm not just gonna pull on like any web
[02:02:51] manner you know
[02:02:54] so Lenny isn't your favorite I mean I
[02:02:56] like lady he's not my favorite I think
[02:02:58] it's cool I like the magician aesthetic

[02:03:01] don't like him more than nive yet dude

[02:15:19] that it's not even two DPS by the way
[02:15:20] it's not two percent DPS it's two
[02:15:22] percent a Nemo damage bonus on top of
[02:15:24] all the other bonuses we have so it's
[02:15:26] definitely not two percent more damage
[02:15:27] but you know what I mean yeah it's very
[02:15:29] copy it doesn't matter all right we're
[02:15:30] gonna crown
[02:15:31] it's good because we're a Nemo main

[02:21:29] for Linney because the cat fetched a
[02:21:31] good piece for us oh could be good
[02:21:34] could be good okay maybe maybe if we say
[02:21:37] it's show time first
[02:21:41] when you use Charles burst do you like
[02:21:43] Hatcher oh my God the Hedgehog person is
[02:21:45] back okay uh I'm not reading that
[02:21:53] this domain is lockless dude [ __ ]
[02:21:55] true
[02:22:04] come on Miller strongly
[02:22:07] oh I'm on linear it's fine this is good
[02:22:10] this is better this better this better
[02:22:10] it's better it's better it's actually
[02:22:11] better the only problem is I have no
[02:22:15] Petra's better on this but the only
[02:22:17] problem is I have no stats like look I
[02:22:21] have like I don't have Petra pieces so
[02:22:24] I'm literally on like no HP so I need to
[02:22:26] run black Castle or my shield does
[02:22:27] nothing
[02:22:34] let me pick up the crystal
[02:22:44] [ __ ]
[02:22:50] okay we do this then we do
[02:22:57] it's showtime it is Showtime [ __ ]
[02:23:00] crit and then I didn't hit her okay I'm
[02:23:01] actually tilted
[02:23:06] why is there a [ __ ] kokomi jellyfish
[02:23:08] in the air
[02:23:11] kokomi
[02:23:16] the hell
[02:23:24] and then 20 attack better than another
[02:23:25] damage percent bonus in this scenario or
[02:23:27] nah no no not at all maybe if you have
[02:23:29] like
[02:23:30] okay usually a mini team also has like
[02:23:32] Chang Ling where the power damage bonus
[02:23:34] is also really good but
[02:23:36] usually no because you with Lenny you
[02:23:39] usually have a [ __ ] up attack set from
[02:23:41] things like Bennett pyro resonance
[02:23:42] Nobles obliged Bennett and also Bennett
[02:23:45] so it depends
[02:23:47] uh on your team and [ __ ] but like
[02:23:49] usually no damage percent is really
[02:23:50] [ __ ] good really really really good
[02:23:57] why can't I switch to the right
[02:23:58] character
[02:24:14] I'm Gonna Save my ALT for Showtime at
[02:24:18] the end
[02:24:32] all right Chad Legends say if you claim
[02:24:35] while it's showtime
[02:24:37] you'll get something good wait someone's
[02:24:39] calling me the [ __ ]
[02:24:40] wait one time
[02:25:32] okay sorry
[02:25:41] lip readers swimming lip readers no it's
[02:25:44] not it's nothing secret I just I mean I
[02:25:46] could tell you guys but I also don't
[02:25:48] want you guys to know so [ __ ] you guys
[02:25:51] foreign
[02:25:58] [Laughter]
[02:26:01] so they called me
[02:26:03] and they're like where is it I have to
[02:26:05] tell them
[02:26:08] were you talking with Kanye no
[02:26:12] after what he said I had to cut ties
[02:26:23] Clueless
[02:26:33] all right let's play actual Lindy team
[02:26:36] so you guys can remember what a good
[02:26:37] Lenny feels like because a lot of you
[02:26:39] people forget a lot of you people forget
[02:26:42] uh what a Lenny can do when he is well
[02:26:45] uh uh played
[02:26:48] with that in mind we still don't have a
[02:26:49] signature artifacts that's not gonna be
[02:26:50] a lot lower than it could be but still
[02:26:54] you think hybrid jungle is good
[02:26:58] ah bad the only problem is wrongly burst
[02:27:00] is that the animation takes exactly one
[02:27:03] Mississippi to Mississippi through
[02:27:04] almost three seconds so it's like pretty
[02:27:06] [ __ ] it's like two and a half it
[02:27:08] takes a while that's like the main
[02:27:09] downside if you have spare time if you
[02:27:11] like the big number I like the big
[02:27:12] number it's fine the only downside is
[02:27:14] you might your Shield might be less
[02:27:15] tanky and it takes a long time but if
[02:27:17] you can get past that then it's fine
[02:27:20] because there's no need for that much HP
[02:27:22] like my strong leads HP is pretty
[02:27:23] [ __ ] low but like my Shield's not
[02:27:25] breaking so it's fine
[02:27:27] usually I'm on Fab but yeah
[02:27:32] I need benefit results
[02:27:35] sorry let's do this
[02:27:37] let's do this pick up the Petra Crystal
[02:27:40] boom that we I don't have my alts
[02:27:43] did we do this this
[02:27:47] team is Loki better I don't know what
[02:27:49] you're talking about
[02:27:50] makes up for it like by a lot
[02:27:56] like I'm 99 certain
[02:27:59] um zhangi is actually better than Daya
[02:28:02] here
[02:28:03] even though I like Dan better like I
[02:28:05] like using Dan here because there's like
[02:28:06] no teams but I'm pretty sure this team's
[02:28:08] better because the problem with that is
[02:28:10] her resistance Interruption lasts like
[02:28:12] [ __ ] negative three seconds so
[02:28:15] because it doesn't last long you can't
[02:28:18] really use it at the start like if let's
[02:28:19] say you use their thing here right
[02:28:20] that's there the new kazua then you bend
[02:28:23] it then you Linny it's basically done
[02:28:25] so you could use that but then if you
[02:28:27] use Daya it's like you would use her
[02:28:29] after Bennett and Kazo but then it's
[02:28:31] like you eat away at your Bennett buff
[02:28:32] so it's kind of weird
[02:28:34] thank you
[02:28:36] but she's still fine like she's you know
[02:28:41] you could use Chang Ling yeah
[02:28:44] shangling is probably the like
[02:28:45] shanglings you any team that can use oh
[02:28:48] shingling blisters
[02:28:53] I was gonna say [ __ ] dude maybe talking
[02:28:55] about shangling hey shangling she
[02:28:59] blessed us
[02:29:00] ah this could be good maybe I don't know
[02:29:02] but this is really really good holy [ __ ]
[02:29:04] okay awesome
[02:29:05] we'll lock this I guess
[02:29:08] damn let me time stamp that that's our
[02:29:10] first piece and that was our first piece
[02:29:12] in an hour and 20 minutes I'm time

[02:38:11] one doesn't show where it is there's
[02:38:12] usually like a little Trail it doesn't
[02:38:13] show it so I'm gonna assume it's like
[02:38:14] nearby but I don't actually know it's
[02:38:18] probably like
[02:38:19] maybe it shows it and I can't see no it
[02:38:21] definitely doesn't can I walk in here no
[02:38:23] okay so let's just assume it's like
[02:38:29] no you literally can't see it I don't
[02:38:30] care what anyone's gonna say so it's
[02:38:31] probably like I'm gonna assume it's like

[02:38:36] okay
[02:38:46] no that was fast
[02:38:48] I mean for most people it probably would

[02:38:51] I'm probably the best explorer that this
[02:38:53] world has ever seen so uh there you go
[02:38:55] before the crystal flies fly away we're
[02:38:57] gonna get all of them so there's one

[02:47:14] solvent but only two mats so that's
[02:47:16] unlucky
[02:47:17] could be good I guess
[02:47:26] fragile not condense
[02:47:28] you know what I meant
[02:47:31] all right back to the [ __ ]
[02:47:34] denouement of sin
[02:47:37] cage that we are in
[02:47:41] okay I actually can't I literally okay I
[02:47:43] actually need to finish this because
[02:47:44] we've been streaming for a while like I
[02:47:45] don't wanna like I have a lot to do
[02:47:46] still and it's only been like yeah so
[02:47:48] let's speed run we're speedrunning now
[02:47:51] I have to put Cab in my team wait Dale's
[02:47:53] already friends with 10 why don't they
[02:47:54] just play cavi
[02:47:56] no we'll say a lot of mistakes
[02:48:01] not Vermillion you changed we strong
[02:48:03] boxed a thousand pieces in Vermilion and
[02:48:06] got nothing but Despair and one good
[02:48:08] piece we're gonna strongbox Vermillion
[02:48:10] literally after this with whatever
[02:48:12] pieces we get from here we're gonna

[02:48:29] first [ __ ] wave without altering but
[02:48:30] it takes so [ __ ] long I actually
[02:48:32] can't
[02:48:33] I don't think I can kill it with that
[02:48:34] whole thing unless I have like shangling
[02:48:36] tell me why shangling
[02:48:40] it's showtime
[02:48:42] okay we're gonna get a good artifact

[02:49:01] end and then we use it as we claim
[02:49:04] it has to be Showtime as we claim I
[02:49:06] think that's my theory
[02:49:13] that's Vermillion good for Lenny I mean
[02:49:15] yeah like just you need the new set for
[02:49:17] them but if you don't have it
[02:49:18] vermillion's good
[02:49:21] don't Farm it for him though
[02:49:36] fine we're saving the show time for the
[02:49:38] end
[02:49:55] no I missed
[02:49:58] [ __ ] I didn't quit
[02:50:06] okay if it's show time good artifact

[02:50:22] I mean
[02:50:23] [Applause]
[02:50:26] Maybe
[02:50:37] you have to use four alts on the tree no

[02:51:44] it worked wait
[02:51:47] surely it's show time surely it's

[02:52:11] what if I make an exception I roll this
[02:52:13] piece right now just to see if it really
[02:52:14] is Showtime
[02:52:20] okay let's do I'm so disclaimer because
[02:52:23] this will probably be in the video
[02:52:25] We're Gonna Roll all of these pieces at
[02:52:27] the end but because it's showtime I'll
[02:52:29] do an exception and we'll roll uh the
[02:52:32] feather we just got [ __ ] the feather we
[02:52:33] just got right now
[02:52:35] what is

[03:07:35] it's fine
[03:07:37] it wasn't show time though I thought if
[03:07:39] we got in show time that would have been
[03:07:40] a true that we wouldn't guaranteed a
[03:07:42] good artifact maybe cocoyo and cocodile
[03:07:44] is enough to be a good artifact but we
[03:07:46] didn't get the showtime so I'm not sure
[03:07:51] okay
[03:07:52] potential potential I think we need to
[03:07:54] hit the full combo though
[03:07:56] unlucky
[03:08:13] foreign

[03:29:34] foreign
[03:29:41] [Music]
[03:30:26] oh no they put skip dialogue they'll
[03:30:28] never because it's a story game
[03:30:31] which means that even on my second
[03:30:33] free-to-play account I still have to uh
[03:30:35] read or listen to all of the Inazuma
[03:30:37] lore despite uh not only having done it

[03:31:21] gonna have to redo it on my other
[03:31:22] account if I want like anything and I
[03:31:26] don't want to do that like having to
[03:31:28] redo a quest without being able to skip
[03:31:31] is really painful like I I the first
[03:31:33] time I enjoyed it but now I'm gonna have
[03:31:34] to do it again
[03:31:36] and it's like uh

[03:32:56] whatever the [ __ ] Nintendo story with
[03:32:58] Fang and we were buying I don't know
[03:32:59] we're just looking around we bought um I

[03:33:03] we're just looking around and this guy
[03:33:05] this guy came up to us there's a [ __ ]
[03:33:08] statue okay there were two statues in
[03:33:10] like a glass display of Fire Emblem
[03:33:12] characters three there's a bileth that
[03:33:14] was like booba and there was Claude and
[03:33:17] [ __ ] listed there or whatever there's
[03:33:18] just three and then this one dude came
[03:33:20] up to us was like yo do you know like he
[03:33:22] was like with a hoodie and like I don't
[03:33:25] know he looked sauce but whatever you

[03:33:39] was like is that like
[03:33:41] is that Japanese I'm like it's it's just
[03:33:44] from a game and then he was like oh cool

[03:33:48] master magician and literally like
[03:33:50] whispered it to me and I'm like okay
[03:33:51] this guy is about to whip this [ __ ] out
[03:33:53] in the Nintendo store I'm gonna leave
[03:33:55] and then I just walked away
[03:33:57] dude okay New York has actually made me
[03:33:59] a worse human like where I live
[03:34:02] whenever someone asks me something like
[03:34:03] I'll answer I'll be polite I'll be nice
[03:34:05] but dude in New York City you literally
[03:34:07] just don't look at people like literally
[03:34:09] there's so many people that are just
[03:34:10] like actual NPCs like just talking to
[03:34:13] themselves and screaming at you that you
[03:34:15] literally just ignore and keep moving so
[03:34:17] now when I'm here sometimes I'll catch
[03:34:18] myself being rude and I just won't
[03:34:19] respond to people and I'm like okay I
[03:34:21] probably shouldn't do that
[03:34:24] no like actually like there's literally
[03:34:27] people that were like dude I went to a
[03:34:29] [ __ ] I went to a pizza place that had
[03:34:32] like Italy in the name and behind the
[03:34:34] counter there's like Lebanese people so
[03:34:35] they're screaming in Arabic I understood
[03:34:36] and they're and then this one dude I
[03:34:39] don't know I think it was like a
[03:34:39] homeless person or something they
[03:34:40] literally came in and they were like
[03:34:41] begging for like not begging but they're
[03:34:43] like trying to like take something
[03:34:44] basically or like trying to get like
[03:34:45] pizza for free or like harass the
[03:34:47] customer I don't know and then the whole
[03:34:49] like everyone behind the counter while
[03:34:51] they were talking to me they were
[03:34:52] screaming like they're telling him to
[03:34:54] leave dude I okay it's actually like a
[03:34:57] different place it's like it's like if
[03:34:59] you designed it feels like a movie no it
[03:35:01] feels like a quest like I don't know I
[03:35:04] don't know all those 4 AM
[03:35:09] but it is what it is
[03:35:11] I love this city how dare you I mean I
[03:35:14] like it too it's just an experience
[03:35:21] I mean it's still better than La it's

[03:36:03] if they do they're weird and another eye
[03:36:05] weird but everyone that likes it likes
[03:36:06] it because of the people there like
[03:36:07] there's a lot of cool people there but
[03:36:09] outside of that dude it's so [ __ ]

[03:36:21] like what the [ __ ] are you saying
[03:36:22] literally everywhere I walked half the
[03:36:23] people looked like they were about to
[03:36:24] punch me I did not feel safe anywhere
[03:36:27] you have to drive an hour to go
[03:36:28] everywhere the only places that are nice
[03:36:30] are like outside like an hour from the
[03:36:32] city where everyone lives so everyone's
[03:36:33] all around like an hour from each other
[03:36:35] as I hate it I hate everything about it
[03:36:39] I am uh yeah New York is way better
[03:36:42] I mean yeah
[03:36:44] what is this slander I'm sorry I just
[03:36:46] don't like it
[03:36:49] maybe I don't know and then the people
[03:36:51] like the people that I know that move
[03:36:52] there are like yeah the people are nice
[03:36:53] but I don't like me here or like I like
[03:36:55] being here because of the people
[03:36:56] basically
[03:36:58] is the rent in L.A even good
[03:37:03] I want to rent in the current market
[03:37:06] yeah well
[03:37:09] minus I don't even know how much
[03:37:25] granted rent here is also very expensive
[03:37:27] so I can't really speak but yeah
[03:37:33] [Laughter]
[03:37:42] I have to pay 1200 to live with five
[03:37:44] other people holy [ __ ] I mean hopefully
[03:37:47] it's like surely it's big it's fine
[03:37:48] surely
[03:37:53] Clueless
[03:37:56] ever expensive yeah I mean right now
[03:37:59] though I'm pretty sure the whole like
[03:38:01] just housing in general is [ __ ] right
[03:38:02] now
[03:38:04] but don't worry guys it'll just keep
[03:38:06] getting worse
[03:38:38] do I want this yeah
[03:38:53] rent may take my life savings but at
[03:38:56] least it's show time
[03:38:58] it's show time
[03:39:02] it is in fact show time so well that's
[03:39:05] fine
[03:39:11] okay don't let my slander ruin your life
[03:39:13] plans I'm allowed to not like a city but
[03:39:15] you can still move there like there's a
[03:39:17] lot of opportunity there's a lot of cool
[03:39:18] people so like I understand why a lot of
[03:39:21] people go there like I travel there
[03:39:23] because I have like there's a lot of
[03:39:24] things that I want to do there so I
[03:39:26] understand the appeal I just would not
[03:39:28] want to live there
[03:39:30] because there are a lot of downsides and
[03:39:32] good food yes and I might not be the
[03:39:34] most experienced well I've been to a lot
[03:39:36] of good places there however Toronto

[03:43:41] news disease [ __ ] literally made a
[03:43:44] villain
[03:43:45] just for that sentence that scar already
[03:43:47] [ __ ] knew
[03:43:59] oh my God it's attack
[03:44:03] foreign
[03:44:11] wait I forgot
[03:44:14] oh dumb I Loki forgot the set gives
[03:44:16] I forgot this head gives a ton of crit
[03:44:18] rate so even pieces with only crit
[03:44:19] damage are good so I might have to look
[03:44:21] back through all of our imagination Jose
[03:44:23] and see if there's pieces will only
[03:44:24] occur damage because I might not have
[03:44:26] locked them for example let's look at
[03:44:27] like feathers let's look let's look
[03:44:28] there might be like a feather that
[03:44:30] doesn't have criterate but has a bunch
[03:44:31] of crit damage you get me
[03:44:33] yeah like this could technically be good
[03:44:35] uh maybe
[03:44:56] go down circuit you unlocked
[03:44:58] if it has no sub stats I still wouldn't
[03:45:00] lock it though but we'll see it might
[03:45:02] not snoring
[03:45:17] perfect
[03:45:19] can you please get pyrode thank you
[03:45:22] no I pressed how do I I just opened my
[03:45:26] windows okay okay I fixed it
[03:45:33] can this guy group so I can [ __ ]
[03:45:35] swirl him I guess he swirled because I
[03:45:37] did the same damage on both wait no
[03:45:38] maybe I just wasn't on the net that's
[03:45:40] why
[03:45:41] uh whatever
[03:45:46] I'll just
[03:45:50] fog
[03:45:57] boom boom it could be good
[03:46:02] and maybe
[03:46:10] [ __ ]
[03:46:28] foreign
[03:46:31] two charge shot
[03:46:34] three shot
[03:46:36] e burst
[03:46:38] please die please die please die please
[03:46:39] please please please please please
[03:46:41] okay we do this we swirl we swirl swirl
[03:46:44] again
[03:46:45] then we bet it Bennett Lynette Lenny
[03:46:49] trick shot
[03:46:52] guys over the hill
[03:46:54] wait let's repogged and now it's
[03:46:56] showtime
[03:46:58] [ __ ]

[03:47:21] what the hell
[03:47:23] wait that was [ __ ] parkour
[03:47:26] that was actually parkour the hell
[03:47:29] it's show time
[03:47:32] oh it's crit rate on the set
[03:47:34] I could still be good if we have like
[03:47:36] enough damage it could still be fine I
[03:47:38] mean
[03:47:40] I guess I'll be fine
[03:47:41] it's crazy it is crit rate
[03:47:44] but the sub stats are perfect so it
[03:47:46] could still be good or a good off piece
[03:47:47] true it could still be good
[03:47:55] especially for a character that isn't
[03:47:57] Lenny because Lenny gets like 24 crit
[03:47:59] rate yummy

[03:55:23] what does the square in square and fair
[03:55:25] even mean okay fair and square is like
[03:55:27] you know how square is like Fair because
[03:55:29] each side of a square is the same length
[03:55:31] that's what a square means because each
[03:55:33] side is like four centimeters for
[03:55:34] example and that's four four four four

[03:56:26] foreign
[03:56:40] actually I was gonna leave anyways I
[03:56:42] think she knew that I wanted to leave
[03:56:43] because she's probably listening to the
[03:56:44] stream so she she knew
[03:56:49] how do you say 10 in French this and
[03:56:53] actually if you say
[03:56:54] 79 no
[03:56:57] yeah 79 it sounds like you're saying
[03:57:02] thank you
[03:57:06] I'll let the Google translate say it
[03:57:24] foreign
[03:57:38] so you can't say 19 and Fontan if you
[03:57:40] type 19 they literally they send you to
[03:57:42] the [ __ ] Fontan court of justice and
[03:57:45] you're put on trial
[03:57:47] did it once he got arrested
[03:57:55] you can't say AED either
[03:57:59] the [ __ ] does that mean
[03:58:01] 420

[04:00:28] husband girlfriend and boyfriend is okay
[04:00:30] so it's as it stands right now it's ciao
[04:00:32] I'll hide them uh kokomi and uh last one
[04:00:35] is undecided actually
[04:00:47] my bad I forgot I actually forgot I'm
[04:00:50] sorry uh with that in mind I think
[04:00:52] you're allowed one uh per region so I
[04:00:55] think with the release of noviet and
[04:00:57] chlorine uh some of those might have to
[04:01:00] be added to the list sorry
[04:01:02] maybe Risley but we I don't know yet
[04:01:04] we'll have to see how they play about to
[04:01:07] see them closer up
[04:01:08] keep rolling on my headset wire
[04:01:10] oh crit damage
[04:01:13] this could be good I guess
[04:01:43] you select Sino I do like cyano
[04:01:50] okay
[04:01:56] he's benched no he's I still plays Dino
[04:02:06] I do like them
[04:02:11] I love Sino
[04:02:16] foreign
[04:02:33] aggravate player a disgusting aggravate
[04:02:36] enjoyer aggravate's pretty cool but if
[04:02:38] you're playing Sino you play quick Gloom
[04:02:40] and you feel a lot better true
[04:02:55] quick Bloom cringe term okay the
[04:02:58] hyperbloom
[04:03:00] same thing
[04:03:04] actually yeah I think about what I said
[04:03:06] sino's best teams are low-key more hyper
[04:03:09] blue than quick blue
[04:03:11] but it doesn't matter
[04:03:20] never see new place I know yes you have
[04:03:23] I play Sino a lot
[04:03:28] foreign
[04:03:36] hyperbloom what are you hyperblooming
[04:03:41] what even is your T you're not
[04:03:43] hyperlooming on kaching you're hyperbole
[04:03:45] on Sino
[04:03:52] um
[04:04:06] look I'm allowed to like a lot of
[04:04:09] characters okay they release too many
[04:04:15] it's showtime
[04:04:19] I didn't get it
[04:04:29] could be good
[04:04:32] it could be good
[04:04:39] coaching official is great
[04:04:42] I mean okay you can play Nikita uh sorry
[04:04:44] not here you can play Barbara or kokomi
[04:04:46] for like quick Bloom just a little bit
[04:04:48] of spare hyperbooms it's fine
[04:04:50] but if you're playing Elon instead of
[04:04:51] like Kazo or sucrose I don't know I
[04:04:54] don't know I mean I'm sure it's probably
[04:04:55] still fine because the alarm is op but
[04:04:57] like I don't know I'm not a big fan of
[04:05:00] that at all
[04:05:06] especially because you want to swirl
[04:05:07] Electro for your official too because
[04:05:09] Fishel does so much [ __ ] damage
[04:05:12] and she got both
[04:05:21] laughs
[04:05:44] boom boom
[04:05:50] boom
[04:05:52] that's bad
[04:05:54] oh
[04:06:00] okay double crit attack
[04:06:03] the criterate roll is really low but
[04:06:05] crit damage is like decent and crit
[04:06:08] damage matters more on the side so it
[04:06:09] could be good
[04:06:10] double crit you know we take it about
[04:06:11] that
[04:06:13] okay that's a piece that's piece finally
[04:06:15] a good piece finally I mean we don't
[04:06:17] even know how it's Gonna Roll but you
[04:06:18] know could be could be good
[04:06:27] how much resin have I spent today
[04:06:35] all right
[04:06:49] um
[04:06:51] I've probably killed like two to three
[04:06:53] in the Overworld genuinely probably like
[04:06:56] three max so 180
[04:07:00] times most of them have been fragile I
[04:07:02] think I did like two or three clears
[04:07:03] without fragiles so let's say one let's
[04:07:05] say 175. 175 times what is it 40 resin
[04:07:09] because each kill would be 40 on average
[04:07:12] that's seven thousand wait that's
[04:07:14] exactly seven thousand I just I just
[04:07:16] whipped out the [ __ ] calculator
[04:07:20] so that would be uh 7K resin
[04:07:23] now there's a little bit of room for I
[04:07:25] might have done a few 20 resins so we'll
[04:07:26] do a bit more because I might have done
[04:07:28] a few like non-condense runs yeah me
[04:07:34] Rune grader 2600. that is weird I feel
[04:07:36] like there's not that many Rune graders
[04:07:38] in the Overworld how have you killed
[04:07:39] 2600 I feel like there's not that many
[04:07:41] have you killed more Rune graders than
[04:07:43] like hilly trolls that's weird I feel
[04:07:45] like they're not as common I feel like
[04:07:47] killing Turtles are okay well 5000 but I
[04:07:49] feel like Hillary drills are like way
[04:07:51] more common but I don't know it's weird
[04:07:53] that's weird
[04:07:56] that's weird
[04:07:58] oh it's okay
[04:08:02] let's keep going haha jumpy Dumpty go
[04:08:06] okay well we're probably gonna do five
[04:08:08] more and then we'll level all of our
[04:08:09] artifacts and then we'll end I think
[04:08:10] that's a plan and then next stream we do
[04:08:12] more strong box maybe Ark on Quest maybe
[04:08:14] caulk maybe balls yep
[04:08:18] oh I didn't even do my commissions but
[04:08:20] let's at least um Expedition
[04:08:22] because I want to make sure I get my
[04:08:23] mats
[04:08:24] for my things
[04:08:27] need my orbs man I need my oars
[04:08:30] my rocks
[04:08:39] yeah we'll probably stream the Dan hung
[04:08:42] ills stream like we'll probably do a
[04:08:44] star rail stream and then again to one
[04:08:45] probably I haven't decided if I want to
[04:08:47] make a guide yet or not I could and I
[04:08:49] already know how to
[04:08:50] allegedly build him like not like you
[04:08:53] know like we from the from the [ __ ]
[04:08:54] trial obviously but I'm just saying like
[04:08:56] I don't know if it's worth the effort
[04:08:58] because it's like gonna be long and I
[04:08:59] have to test a lot of [ __ ] so I might
[04:09:01] uh it's just a bit like I'm gonna have
[04:09:03] to rush really hard so I don't know I
[04:09:05] haven't decided yet but I do like them a
[04:09:07] lot so we're definitely gonna play him
[04:09:08] and stream him for sure
[04:09:14] clear is shorter than the crafting table
[04:09:16] I can't
[04:09:21] yeah while Xiao isn't so
[04:09:30] oh wait oh my God my teapot is probably
[04:09:33] full why did I say it like that yeah
[04:09:34] teapot is Max let me go buy stuff fast
[04:09:36] before the week the week so three set
[04:09:41] eight years balls balls hey tubby

[04:11:18] miss Vermillion
[04:11:36] why did you dash on me that's fine

[04:11:52] it is Showtime fog
[04:11:55] maybe we'll uh maybe he'll show us a
[04:11:57] good artifact
[04:12:02] that's the wrong sound I meant to do it
[04:12:05] it's I mean now I'm just gonna
[04:12:15] we'll finish this run in the multiple
[04:12:17] level artifacts like one more run surely
[04:12:20] because we need the XP we can't destroy
[04:12:22] them so I'll just destroy like

[04:16:59] narration say actually
[04:17:05] let's see reminder this set does want
[04:17:08] crit damage a lot so that would be very
[04:17:10] uh beautiful of a stat to get
[04:17:15] so let's look through and let's level
[04:17:18] the credential pieces or anything we
[04:17:19] have locked pretty much
[04:17:22] okay we're not leveling that why did I
[04:17:24] lock that
[04:17:25] okay why do I keep locking I mean it has
[04:17:27] HP and criterate it might get her damage
[04:17:29] I guess I guess it's worth it [ __ ] it
[04:17:33] if it doesn't get something good we'll
[04:17:35] just Chuck it back into another piece
[04:17:36] let me go no copium here see oh we got
[04:17:39] wait why did I skip it we got crit
[04:17:41] damage
[04:17:42] wait I don't know why I skipped it
[04:17:46] let me cook shot let me cook let me cook
[04:17:48] up a nice meal what if there's a HP
[04:17:50] scaling character who wants crit
[04:17:54] okay
[04:17:57] are you letting me cook I'm currently in
[04:17:59] the kitchen I'm [ __ ] flipping
[04:18:01] pancakes
[04:18:02] making an omelet
[04:18:08] te
[04:18:09] wait low roll but it's all good
[04:18:13] I mean not even that low overall
[04:18:15] it's like mid
[04:18:17] okay I might be cooking
[04:18:19] I might have uh found the secret sauce
[04:18:26] it's gonna get power good enough for
[04:18:27] Lenny good enough for you know redacted
[04:18:33] because the thing with this video is
[04:18:36] like
[04:18:36] probably by the time this is released we
[04:18:38] know what characters are gonna want to
[04:18:39] use this set right soon people are going
[04:18:41] to be re-watching this maybe in a week a
[04:18:43] month and be like oh this is such a good
[04:18:44] piece for
[04:18:45] someone I don't know I literally don't
[04:18:47] know but it probably will be so true
[04:18:50] maybe by the time this upload I'm like
[04:18:52] oh [ __ ] it's [ __ ] you know navient at
[04:18:54] the clock also we have 666 for uh more
[04:18:56] up so
[04:19:00] all right let's go crit crit crit crit
[04:19:02] crit crit crit
[04:19:06] not bad maybe I don't know how can how
[04:19:08] can I tell I it's hard to probably dude
[04:19:10] it's a [ __ ] Fontaine set someone's
[04:19:11] gonna need it not Lenny I tried to build
[04:19:13] my Lenny
[04:19:15] could still be good
[04:19:32] one more critical roll would actually be
[04:19:34] huge
[04:19:35] one more critical and that's a good
[04:19:36] piece
[04:19:40] crit page crit
[04:19:42] oh wait that's okay actually good usable
[04:19:46] nice and usable what is my voice track I
[04:19:49] don't know that's good good piece uh at
[04:19:51] least one disappears
[04:19:53] it's not like insane but it's good and
[04:19:55] there's an HP roll so okay let me
[04:19:57] rephrase that if a character wants to
[04:19:58] set an HP then it's really good because
[04:20:01] yeah the roles aren't the highest yeah
[04:20:02] it only has three sub stats but critic
[04:20:04] damage
[04:20:05] on a new set and HP with an HP roll you
[04:20:09] know
[04:20:09] we like it all right let's keep going
[04:20:11] maybe some other flowers
[04:20:16] oh this one I didn't lock but it has
[04:20:17] screw damage and we both know how this
[04:20:19] set works
[04:20:21] arrows thanks for the 10 big months
[04:20:33] energy recharge
[04:20:35] [Music]
[04:20:43] normally only crit damage I wouldn't go
[04:20:45] for but this set with like Lenny like
[04:20:46] you
[04:20:47] you don't really need crit rate with
[04:20:49] Lenny
[04:20:51] if you're running Mario say so
[04:20:55] oh man it could be good
[04:21:15] I'm sorry I want to find a piece I can
[04:21:16] throw in

[04:23:56] pulsating it might get a crit damage
[04:23:57] roll okay
[04:24:02] this could be good crit damage HP era
[04:24:05] hey all I'm saying is there's potential
[04:24:09] ideally Rose Parade but even without it
[04:24:11] just like good uh okay flat defense but

[04:29:04] it's not terrible do I have a better one
[04:29:08] already let's see do I have a better one
[04:29:09] uh that's not better this is arguably
[04:29:12] well yeah um
[04:29:14] this is better right
[04:29:19] oh I have this wait 21.9 what is this
[04:29:21] one
[04:29:23] 18 uh but also has an attacker
[04:29:27] yeah I don't want to keep it whatever

[04:29:36] please
[04:29:38] oh
[04:29:39] boy only one Emerald the rest is okay

[04:29:50] that's so [ __ ] good that is so good
[04:29:54] all right easy that's good that's good
[04:29:56] we basically just that's actually good
[04:29:57] even the Emerald's not bad it depends on
[04:29:59] who
[04:30:01] but that's good we cook the feather you
[04:30:03] let a chef like me in the kitchen
[04:30:06] I cook up a nice a nice artifact
[04:30:15] uh sometimes tell me about these dude
[04:30:18] this is so good
[04:30:19] if only I had four stop stops but who
[04:30:21] cares
[04:30:23] Chef yeah like shangling
[04:30:26] cup that's clear
[04:30:34] that's clear
[04:30:36] all right let's level this so it could
[04:30:38] be I mean it's only crew damage but it
[04:30:40] could be 40K damage you never know till
[04:30:41] you know I've leveled a piece like this
[04:30:43] a thundering Fury flower it now has 41.2
[04:30:46] I believe crit damage so you never know
[04:30:47] until okay well it was worth a shot you
[04:30:50] might think I look dumb now but I still
[04:30:52] would uh like to emphasize that it's
[04:30:54] worth a shot because
[04:30:57] you never know until you know and
[04:30:59] sometimes you don't know when you don't
[04:31:01] know
[04:31:04] oh
[04:31:05] what
[04:31:12] why did I just hit my mind I'm sorry I
[04:31:15] don't know if that [ __ ] with your
[04:31:15] earphones I don't know why I did that
[04:31:18] yeah I am not okay I am not okay
[04:31:22] I don't know why I did that well this is
[04:31:25] like uh maybe a good feather
[04:31:34] I like your damage let me make sure I
[04:31:36] don't have uh do I have artifact XP left
[04:31:38] uh they have enough
[04:31:46] what if I flip my mouse
[04:31:49] I don't want to drop it expensive Mouse
[04:31:53] oh
[04:31:55] well I might have to do it again
[04:32:00] maybe it worked maybe I found the
[04:32:02] [ __ ] maybe I found the artifacts oh
[04:32:04] wait don't do that side
[04:32:09] [ __ ] it didn't work I mean this is still
[04:32:12] good this is still good this is still
[04:32:13] good
[04:32:15] one more control
[04:32:18] okay if this gets a crit roll no I'm
[04:32:20] gonna be more specific if this gets crit
[04:32:22] damage I'll do a 10 pull on the house
[04:32:23] for Content as an offering to the RNG
[04:32:26] Gods above in gentian
[04:32:34] [ __ ]
[04:32:35] wait another good piece
[04:32:38] damn yo our [ __ ] live yet maybe we
[04:32:41] don't know what he's gonna use
[04:32:43] our future characters can be cracked
[04:32:49] we don't know we actually don't know we
[04:32:50] actually know I'm just I'm guessing it's
[04:32:52] like how would I know
[04:32:55] Temple now I said temple if I got crit
[04:32:57] damage the other thing I literally said
[04:32:59] if I could damage I'm sorry I said if we
[04:33:01] could damage our Temple why would I why
[04:33:03] would I change the promise these could
[04:33:06] all be good by the way because crew
[04:33:07] damage uh is good
[04:33:13] how do I do that
[04:33:18] well
[04:33:21] I mean it could
[04:33:33] dude stop stop now I have to level it
[04:33:36] because it has 61 at level eight so it's
[04:33:37] good enough to level but I don't want it
[04:33:39] I don't
[04:33:40] stop giving me him stop stop stop stop
[04:33:42] stop stop stop
[04:33:47] wait what is this good what is
[04:33:52] I don't even know how to feel anymore
[04:33:54] about artifacts like I don't know what's
[04:33:57] good and what's wrong and what's right I
[04:34:00] thought I knew I thought I knew but now
[04:34:02] I don't I'm confused and I'm frustrated
[04:34:17] okay this is I'm not keeping this it's
[04:34:19] like one of everything now I'm not
[04:34:21] keeping that like it's
[04:34:24] it's
[04:34:25] if I didn't have as many em pieces as I
[04:34:27] have right now like if I didn't have all
[04:34:29] the other artifacts I have then this
[04:34:31] could be good but it's not worth it for
[04:34:33] me
[04:34:43] yeah I guess it could get another em
[04:34:45] roll and then 80 em plus 10 er is dude I
[04:34:48] don't know I mean
[04:34:53] I don't know I I just don't want to look
[04:34:55] at that artifact do you ever have an

[04:42:25] we still have this beauty of an artifact
[04:42:27] yeah credential circlet is a bit more
[04:42:29] versatile on this set because it was
[04:42:31] great but it could still be really good
[04:42:32] for a lot of characters so and amazing
[04:42:35] Subs that's like almost basically
[04:42:37] perfect
[04:42:38] um so we're gonna level it

[04:55:12] em attack crit rate crit damage even
[04:55:14] arguably ER they're all good on the set
[04:55:18] there's a lot we could get
[04:55:20] I have a good feeling I gotta fit
[04:55:36] what
[04:55:42] is
[04:55:47] I mean could be good Mike Phantom
[04:55:50] there's a problem
[04:55:52] we need more artifact XP though
[04:55:58] foreign
[04:56:19] of the HP pieces that I've been locking

[04:56:55] let's go through it
[04:57:02] I have been cursed to only get elemental
[04:57:06] Mastery I think uh that's the only
[04:57:07] explanation I don't have artifact XP
[04:57:09] anymore
[04:57:11] foreign
[04:57:26] Professor why can't I get a crit
[04:57:30] I actually can't roll crit it's fine

[04:57:40] or not gilded golden Troop
[04:57:45] okay okay okay this is also good sub
[04:57:49] stats

[04:58:00] [ __ ] plus four piece I can throw
[04:58:04] like these are all [ __ ] not plus four
[04:58:14] well this I mean I could technically
[04:58:16] throw this
[04:58:18] to help us do
[04:58:33] whoops
[04:58:35] okay what if we level the double
[04:58:37] crippies we could be official God now I
[04:58:40] don't have enough artifact XP to level
[04:58:41] it slowly but we can level it fast
[04:58:43] uh and see how it goes so one level is
[04:58:46] gonna get crit yes it did uh no surprise
[04:58:48] here we try to build
[04:58:50] insert Future character or Lenny and
[04:58:53] guess what uh by accident we build our
[04:58:55] official so there you go we now have
[04:58:56] official build without even trying
[04:58:59] wait this is wait wait wait wait I
[04:59:03] I have no XP okay okay I'm sorry I'm
[04:59:06] going on a rampage I'm sorry I actually
[04:59:07] need to level this piece I'm actually
[04:59:09] like I I can't I can't I can't I can't I
[04:59:11] can't I can't I can't I can't I can't

[04:59:44] please one more control I'll do anything
[04:59:46] one more oh oh

[04:59:59] official I don't care I don't care I
[05:00:01] don't care it's actually still good I
[05:00:02] don't care don't laugh it's still good
[05:00:03] it's still good that's a lot of crit I
[05:00:05] don't care still fine a lot of HP but
[05:00:07] yeah I
[05:00:09] guess is what it is
[05:00:13] sometimes in live chat you just let this
[05:00:15] be a life lesson sometimes you need to
[05:00:16] know when to just say it is what it is
[05:00:18] because sometimes it just is what it is
[05:00:20] and that's that's all that it is what it
[05:00:22] is it is man it is what it is
[05:00:33] do I have a good sense attack or Em are
[05:00:36] like equally as good for Fishel so
[05:00:39] either would be fine
[05:00:41] okay we have like literally none except
[05:00:43] this one
[05:00:45] surely this gets good damage surely
[05:00:47] right
[05:00:49] surely right
[05:00:51] surely crit damage right
[05:00:53] surely crit damage right okay never mind
[05:00:58] goblet
[05:01:00] dendro Geo okay Alberto peace
[05:01:04] Electro okay we have official piece

[05:01:07] release
[05:01:13] if this guy's current I'm happy if it
[05:01:14] doesn't I don't talk about it
[05:01:17] uh I mean could still be good
[05:01:23] might as well pulsate it
[05:01:24] not much to lose I'm gonna be honest
[05:01:33] [ __ ] now I have to level it okay this
[05:01:35] could be good this could be good oh God
[05:01:37] I have to level it now
[05:01:38] give me good it could be good
[05:02:02] I was like does it always take you this
[05:02:04] long to find an artifact to throw away
[05:02:06] shut up
[05:02:08] okay I don't care what anyone or their
[05:02:11] mother says I don't need one two three
[05:02:15] dendro Crimson witch goblets that look
[05:02:17] the [ __ ] same I think this is the
[05:02:19] worst one the HP is pretty nice uh
[05:02:22] maybe this one's the worst yeah because
[05:02:24] this one's better and then this one
[05:02:26] might be good on someone
[05:02:32] delete the HP hat or is it
[05:02:34] this is 15 credit though this is
[05:02:36] actually not a bad office
[05:02:39] for like five something
[05:02:44] okay
[05:02:46] please official Goblin I mean it could
[05:02:48] be good you never know until you know it
[05:02:50] right okay now I know
[05:02:53] I mean okay uh if
[05:02:56] if 21 could damage it could still be
[05:02:57] good I know this looks terrible but if
[05:02:59] it gets 21 for damage
[05:03:01] yeah it was worth a shot it was a shot
[05:03:03] I was at the shot
[05:03:09] this could be good this set is really
[05:03:10] good for Albedo we might accidentally
[05:03:12] build our Albedo
[05:03:22] it's okay
[05:03:24] might be worth keeping honestly
[05:03:38] it's okay it's actually okay
[05:03:41] foreign
[05:03:51] wait did I not get a double crit circlet
[05:04:02] uh
[05:04:04] um this could be both of these could be
[05:04:06] good
[05:04:27] well back to the artifact box as we go
[05:04:44] wait was that trying to level
[05:04:52] this could be really good if this has
[05:04:54] criterate it's amazing
[05:04:55] it's actually so close to being good
[05:04:57] like literally all that needs is crit
[05:04:58] rate and suddenly it's great
[05:05:07] it was worth a shot
[05:05:09] surely we don't need to spend more than
[05:05:10] seven thousand resin take a good uh set
[05:05:12] right that would be uh absurd
[05:05:19] sorry
[05:05:25] this also would be really good if you
[05:05:27] get your damage
[05:05:34] oh wait em your quit damage H3 these
[05:05:40] could be valuable
[05:05:42] especially the em and credential ER
[05:05:44] could be good as well
[05:05:46] I like what I'm seeing I'm gonna have to
[05:05:48] throw another Plus 20.
[05:05:51] I'm never using this in my life
[05:05:55] this could be good if this rolls crit
[05:05:58] damage amazing if it rolls em could be
[05:06:00] good if it rolls both also amazing let's
