[00:30:42] um someone called me actually
[00:30:44] um and when actually someone came up to
[00:30:45] me they said sucks actually this is why
[00:30:47] I'm streaming surreal the CEO of star
[00:30:49] rail Mr honkai himself literally said
[00:30:52] Fox
[00:30:53] I used you as a motivation when
[00:30:56] designing Jin yuan's Lightning God you
[00:30:58] guys see how big he is that's actually
[00:30:59] inspired off of me his name was gonna be
[00:31:01] Nick but they changed it to lightning
[00:31:03] Lord so the reason behind that was he
[00:31:06] was a big fan of my stream and one day
[00:31:07] he was watching my stream and got
[00:31:09] inspired because I was so
[00:31:11] um uh electrical like he was like dude
[00:31:14] your personality is so like bursting
[00:31:16] with energy that I want to make you a
[00:31:19] bursting character so he designed me for
[00:31:21] that so anyways long story short uh you
[00:31:23] know really likes my content thinks I'm
[00:31:25] great tall all of that and ended up
[00:31:28] designing the lightning board after me
[00:31:29] and so I'm playing Star rail today for
[00:31:32] that reason
[00:31:33] so we'll play join you in later
[00:31:35] why is he streaming from a water bottle
[00:31:37] what does that mean what does that mean
[00:31:40] like like that explain that joke if it's
[00:31:42] supposed to be funny explain I didn't
[00:31:43] get a hunt
[00:31:46] dude what the [ __ ] is this I mean
[00:31:50] wow dissociation
[00:31:53] is good because you have a lot of money
[00:31:55] right
[00:31:56] I mean reduction die is like
[00:32:00] um
[00:32:01] [Music]
[00:32:03] okay we're rich
[00:32:06] you're so quiet today it's unnerving how
[00:32:09] how is it unnerving that I'm I have
[00:32:12] neighbors that I must be considerate
[00:32:14] about why is it unnerving
[00:32:25] I'm scared
[00:32:27] of what
[00:32:38] okay we're gonna buy a curio
[00:32:41] that's good
[00:32:46] you sound very strange
[00:32:48] okay listen
[00:32:50] I'm sorry you guys are used to to okay
[00:32:53] I'm sorry you guys are used to listening
[00:32:55] to me being a bit louder but sometimes I
[00:32:58] have to be considered
[00:32:59] you guys only want me to stream when I
[00:33:01] can scream at the top of my lungs no
[00:33:03] okay I'm showing
[00:33:07] Troy Samaritan does and you guys either
[00:33:11] take and receive that information or
[00:33:15] [ __ ] you
[00:33:20] I think
[00:33:24] dude this is literally I'm literally um
[00:33:27] this is YouTube's loud streaming
[00:33:34] remember when you kicked
[00:33:36] remember when you kicked out your
[00:33:38] brother out of his room because you were
[00:33:40] screaming okay listen he decided to go
[00:33:43] sleep upstairs because I was streaming
[00:33:46] that's not because I was loud it's just
[00:33:48] normal if someone's streaming you would
[00:33:49] want to go
[00:33:51] upstairs on a different door because you
[00:33:53] don't want to be in the background
[00:33:55] that's normal
[00:33:56] that had nothing to do with me being
[00:33:58] loud
[00:34:04] if anything me being loud helped him
[00:34:06] sleep better because it's like it drowns
[00:34:08] out the voices it's like the voices oh
[00:34:10] my God I can't sleep there's too many
[00:34:12] voices but if you're getting distracted
[00:34:13] by a five out of six streamer then
[00:34:15] there's no more voices in your head but
[00:34:17] his
[00:34:18] proof
[00:34:22] true thanks Alex you really saved my
[00:34:24] sleep and my life like And subscribe if

[00:34:34] did you guess the exact average number
[00:34:36] five gifted decisions at the past four
[00:34:38] six

[00:34:43] 18K
[00:34:46] misery 23 whatever
[00:34:52] 8.9k

[00:35:02] [Music]

[00:35:37] good artifacts we're gonna do both
[00:35:38] literally both good artifacts and good

[00:35:48] only have we been waiting but we're also
[00:35:50] at our most presentable
[00:35:53] and I think that there's something to be
[00:35:55] said about that
[00:35:57] I
[00:35:58] think there's something to be said about
[00:36:00] that
[00:36:05] like if I watched a streamer be this
[00:36:09] calm I would be gifting as many Subs as
[00:36:11] as possible honestly they would probably
[00:36:14] my bank would would block my bank
[00:36:19] I hear noise outside I'm afraid
[00:36:24] if this is my
[00:36:29] [Music]
[00:36:31] smile shielded characters take 16 less

[00:38:01] gift of giving okay because my presence
[00:38:04] is a gift to you okay and like no ego
[00:38:07] but I'm just saying like you know
[00:38:09] obviously like I was just like okay like
[00:38:11] the more the merrier so I might as well
[00:38:13] do an extra stream and then you guys
[00:38:15] aren't reciprocating
[00:38:18] look at this Pom-Pom sticker
[00:38:24] [ __ ] hate Pom-Pom but it's pretty
[00:38:25] cute
[00:38:33] it's a plus seven rated dude
[00:38:40] 720p stream I can't okay listen the only
[00:38:45] way I can fix my 720p stream is if I end
[00:38:47] it and restart but I feel like
[00:38:53] who's next
[00:38:56] hello
[00:39:00] wait okay I have a question
[00:39:09] chat
[00:39:11] does anyone know how to change the
[00:39:12] stream to 1080p
[00:39:18] wait the Discord not ping this whole
[00:39:20] time
[00:39:21] oh it did it did I'm getting one guy
[00:39:26] [Music]
[00:39:27] but it actually didn't
[00:39:30] why did this could not ping
[00:39:34] oh no we have no discordians here
[00:39:42] [Music]
[00:39:45] little bro is streaming on his phone if
[00:39:49] I see my phone you probably have better
[00:39:50] quality
[00:39:52] yeah these suck
[00:39:56] [Music]
[00:40:03] to be fair my Discord was closed on my
[00:40:04] PC I didn't think that would matter
[00:40:05] though
[00:40:07] wait okay real talk though wait wait
[00:40:08] real talk real talk does anyone know if
[00:40:10] I restart stream it when I switch to
[00:40:11] gungeon like eventually right
[00:40:15] if I restart stream
[00:40:20] [Music]
[00:40:24] if I restart stream right
[00:40:28] how the [ __ ] would I even be able to
[00:40:30] make it 1080 do I have to change my bit
[00:40:31] rate because is my if your bit rate's
[00:40:33] too high could it make the quality worse
[00:40:35] or is that not a thing
[00:40:40] what am I I mean this
[00:40:42] foreign
[00:40:46] [Music]
[00:40:51] stop saying I look like people that I
[00:40:53] don't know like who the [ __ ] is Gargamel
[00:40:56] what am I supposed to know them why you
[00:40:59] guys keep saying I look like random
[00:41:00] people I don't know who they are
[00:41:04] living on I'm not Googling it this can't
[00:41:06] end well if I Google it
[00:41:09] actually true um
[00:41:12] the evil guy from The Smurfs okay I
[00:41:14] don't look like that I actually like
[00:41:17] okay sometimes you guys like you're
[00:41:18] funny and I'll admit it but that's
[00:41:20] literally not true that's literally not
[00:41:22] true
[00:41:22] also it's pronounced Gargamel
[00:41:25] this is not true
[00:41:29] it's legit just objectively and I'm an
[00:41:31] objective man not true
[00:41:37] enemies ahead
[00:41:39] it's not true
[00:41:45] wait I might actually die I should
[00:41:46] probably put a fire character here uh
[00:41:48] [ __ ] you ting Yoon ratio
[00:41:53] you could Auto Battle this or I'm gonna
[00:41:54] die
[00:41:56] be honest I think I can get out of the
[00:41:58] battle
[00:42:03] actually we'll start by like
[00:42:07] volley's okay
[00:42:09] now well just okay like I know it's fine
[00:42:10] but I was thinking like
[00:42:12] if I end stream and change the bid rate
[00:42:15] because you're not that 6 000. maybe my
[00:42:17] the internet is not good enough for 6K

[01:36:02] guaranteed
[01:36:04] yeah there's actually a
[01:36:06] yeah I kind of want to say this story
[01:36:08] but basically
[01:36:10] a lot of people that stopped me and were
[01:36:12] like dude literally every single person
[01:36:14] that recognized me at this thing
[01:36:15] literally every single person with no
[01:36:18] exceptions they all either called me
[01:36:20] short or said I'm surprised you're this
[01:36:21] tall
[01:36:24] or said Xiao is short one guy said Chow
[01:36:26] is short I'm surprised at how many
[01:36:28] people were here that knew me so shout
[01:36:30] out to all of you you were all cute and
[01:36:31] amazing but also
[01:36:34] [ __ ] all of you
[01:36:38] people being like okay
[01:36:40] okay real talk real okay I'm being like
[01:36:42] dead ass right this one person went up
[01:36:44] one person recognized Fang okay went up
[01:36:47] there I was like oh my God like I love
[01:36:48] your streams or not literally like the
[01:36:49] cutest fan like the most like nicest
[01:36:51] wholesome it was like this the cutest
[01:36:54] interaction I've ever seen they dressed
[01:36:56] well it was just like a nice person okay
[01:36:58] and then everyone that came up to me no
[01:37:00] disrespect but you were all just like
[01:37:01] all just like coming up to me like yo
[01:37:04] bro you're short
[01:37:05] but I was towering over them
[01:37:08] the [ __ ] is this am I a joke to you
[01:37:13] anyways
[01:37:15] kazoo or sucrose and ayato vape
[01:37:20] no maybe I should just stick to
[01:37:22] answering questions
[01:37:33] are pretty interchangeable cause was
[01:37:35] usually better unless you want to
[01:37:36] on-field then sucrose is better
[01:37:38] but there's a few exceptions like
[01:37:39] thrilling tales on sucrose can sometimes
[01:37:41] be nice
[01:37:43] um and causwell can sometimes be a lot
[01:37:45] better if you don't need the em but want
[01:37:47] the elemental damage buff for example a
[01:37:49] freeze team Right freeze can't really
[01:37:51] use em but can use the elemental image
[01:37:53] from casual so while a lot of times
[01:37:54] they're interchangeable sometimes one
[01:37:56] can be significantly better for the
[01:37:57] other another example taser teams you
[01:37:59] might want your sucrose on field doing
[01:38:02] you know and then you can use casual
[01:38:03] your other team
[01:38:06] how much you are for farazan around six
[01:38:08] to seven hundred
[01:38:10] that should be enough to get you her
[01:38:12] burstack next patch if you wanted to get
[01:38:15] it back like within a day or two you
[01:38:16] might need a bit more
[01:38:19] and now she needs a lot like like okay
[01:38:21] I'm not even kidding like 250 to 300 at
[01:38:24] c0 it could be less if you're running
[01:38:25] like triple Animo or if you're like
[01:38:27] using your e and like but like you need
[01:38:30] as much as you can get C6 you can get
[01:38:31] away with less
[01:38:44] nowhere to hide what's your opinion on
[01:38:46] hyperboom Sarah if I speak I'm in big
[01:38:48] trouble

[01:56:28] sulky things eight months Fang why are
[01:56:30] you laughing
[01:56:40] bark for Vermilion
[01:56:43] foreign
[01:56:50] food you're bad
[01:57:01] it's a dendro cup with 3.9 crit rate
[01:57:04] seven crit damage and 100 em good on
[01:57:06] anyone oh
[01:57:10] you tell me
[01:57:13] where is it
[01:57:14] you tell me
[01:57:18] this came out we got this like the first
[01:57:20] day sumeru came out literally like one
[01:57:22] of the first dendro goblets in the game
[01:57:24] it had a Mac trade role Max could damage
[01:57:26] roll four statter it wrote on the m and
[01:57:28] HP and one uh crit damage
[01:57:37] oh
[01:57:41] it's not um it's like it looks better
[01:57:44] than it is but it can be really good
[01:57:45] like crit and EM is good for like
[01:57:48] um spread carries like I'll hide them
[01:57:49] can use it like that
[01:57:53] or characters like split scaling like um
[01:57:55] like silhani but I was like yam scaling
[01:57:58] and then also a lick spread
[01:58:01] um but in general crit is usually a bit
[01:58:03] better
[01:58:04] but still good
[01:58:08] yeah nahita too the heater too like I
[01:58:10] use this [ __ ] on heeda no one asked but
[01:58:12] I'm gonna show you anyways once again
[01:58:15] let me show you I have a deep wood a
[01:58:19] deepwood 103 em feather that I use on
[01:58:22] the heater because it helps give me some
[01:58:23] more em for offfield and also on field
[01:58:25] and have some error on it too
[01:58:29] thanks for asking
[01:58:33] not even four set okay the thing is yeah
[01:58:36] so when nahida first came out I was like
[01:58:39] okay really you should use deepwood
[01:58:41] because why the [ __ ] would you not use
[01:58:42] deepwood right and I agree but since
[01:58:45] nahida's release there has been
[01:58:47] approximately eight dendro characters
[01:58:48] that use deepwood literally every new
[01:58:50] [ __ ] support character is just oh
[01:58:52] dendro support use five and deepwood
[01:58:54] dendro support use five and deepwood
[01:58:56] dental support use five and deepwood so
[01:58:58] a lot of times I'm playing nahida in
[01:58:59] like a new team or whatever with another
[01:59:01] dendro character so I'm like I might as
[01:59:02] well give mine a heater damage and give
[01:59:04] the [ __ ] random other character
[01:59:05] deepwood
[01:59:06] it's like yeah if she's your only dendro
[01:59:08] go [ __ ] deep wood but like
[01:59:10] baiju there's so many [ __ ]
[01:59:12] democrators that use Depot it's like it
[01:59:13] depends but yeah
[01:59:16] also even then I would probably rather
[01:59:17] go for gilded than two two but whatever
[01:59:19] yeah my point
[01:59:22] could this be the goblet
[01:59:35] it's a good shot the Geo Region's gonna
[01:59:37] come out soon we're gonna get leeway too
[01:59:41] what
[01:59:45] Lee UAE
[01:59:52] right now right here right now
[01:59:55] the wind melted as one with wind and
[01:59:59] Cloud thank you
[02:00:02] yeah we're gonna get a new Geo region
[02:00:04] because okay think about it right think
[02:00:06] about how many dendro characters we've
[02:00:07] got in a Sumer right and if they're
[02:00:09] great I love the Denver characters but
[02:00:11] like think about how few Geo characters
[02:00:12] we have so what I think what I think and
[02:00:15] this might be this isn't a leak okay we
[02:00:16] don't talk about leaks here I'm just
[02:00:18] saying what if they didn't release that
[02:00:20] many danger characters sorry Geo
[02:00:22] characters because they're waiting for
[02:00:23] the next Geo region for the Geo
[02:00:26] expansion where'd you we get the the wet
[02:00:28] cement reaction
[02:00:30] and mossy Rock
[02:00:36] think about that
[02:00:42] maybe when the chasm comes out maybe
[02:00:44] when the chasm goes out we'll get the
[02:00:45] Geo expansion
[02:00:48] and Albedo's gonna be on standard Banner
[02:00:57] I need to swirl the [ __ ]
[02:01:00] did I just roll that joke
[02:01:11] how did I
[02:01:14] it's actually not my setup that's why
[02:01:17] if I was at home I hit that why are you
[02:01:20] so quiet
[02:01:21] I am
[02:01:23] poor
[02:01:26] [Music]
[02:01:27] what do you mean I'm being normal today
[02:01:33] that could be good
[02:01:48] for big tea yeah it gives you what like
[02:01:51] 60 em per shot so 120 is that without
[02:01:54] refinement anyways attacking em when you
[02:01:57] charge shot I was like fine
[02:02:02] 80. there you go 80.
[02:02:05] 80 amp per shot times two right so it
[02:02:07] should be 160.
[02:02:12] you take those
[02:02:16] I was actually thinking about like who
[02:02:17] would be good on and like realistically
[02:02:19] you're just chart shotting characters
[02:02:20] that charge on the M it's just too honey
[02:02:22] and [ __ ] um
[02:02:25] but even gonyu
[02:02:29] I mean yeah like I guess it depends on
[02:02:32] what else you have yeah there's only two
[02:02:46] oh this is but it's nice to see you
[02:02:49] again have a nice stream yeah I
[02:02:52] appreciate they said 500 bits uh that's
[02:02:54] definitely a lie saying you have to go

[02:19:10] monstat for the end of the game where
[02:19:12] Kaya's dad says I am the abyss God and
[02:19:15] then we fight Kaya's Dad we're gonna get
[02:19:18] new anima reactions because we go back
[02:19:20] to monstad this could be good
[02:19:25] True by the way that's actually true
[02:19:27] lore
[02:19:33] I mean realistically we're probably
[02:19:34] going back to monsat so like actually
[02:19:35] true
[02:19:37] and then we're gonna get a kaya skin
[02:19:39] where he's gonna be shirtless because
[02:19:40] we're back to monstat and Kaya has lore
[02:19:43] because of the [ __ ] the the Carrie bear
[02:19:45] request which if you didn't I'm not

[02:20:35] what he did where
[02:20:42] did he no no way
[02:20:47] in the event wait actually we link it
[02:20:51] he only said oh yeah he said Ashanti
[02:20:52] yeah I heard that never mind I heard
[02:20:53] that but that's one word bro it's
[02:20:55] literally Enchanted
[02:21:03] honestly I would sound better okay like
[02:21:05] no disrespect like a kind of sounds
[02:21:07] great right but like I'm just saying
[02:21:08] like I could make any character sound
[02:21:10] better like that's just my like
[02:21:11] signature
[02:21:21] as you wish me as one with wind and
[02:21:24] Cloud
[02:21:25] into the wind wait what if you're
[02:21:28] playing a different language does he
[02:21:29] still speak French if you're playing
[02:21:30] like Korean like does he still say
[02:21:32] Ashanti if you're playing in like
[02:21:34] Japanese
[02:21:39] no wow so it's not even French it's just
[02:21:43] English French
[02:21:44] it's like American French hell yeah
[02:21:46] brother
[02:21:49] Ashante brother
[02:21:52] I play Sienna he didn't say anything
[02:21:54] like that um
[02:21:55] that's [ __ ] up
[02:22:05] why is your voice so deep oh thanks for
[02:22:07] noticing I'm actually the voice actor of
[02:22:09] Dane's Leaf uh when he's released so
[02:22:11] that's why like that explains a lot yeah
[02:22:19] people say I sound like corpse husband
[02:22:21] actually so you know like it's no big
[02:22:24] deal like it really isn't a big deal but
[02:22:26] I thought I should point out that fact
[02:22:27] just in case you're like not used to it
[02:22:36] I'm like the Jungkook again chin you
[02:22:37] know the Dwayne Johnson
[02:22:39] uh who else what else do you guys call
[02:22:42] me Chad who else

[02:22:49] [Music]
[02:22:57] how good is yam Kirara for bloom or
[02:22:59] hyperbloom no
[02:23:01] okay first of all for hyperbloom it's
[02:23:03] not Kirara that's hyper building she's
[02:23:05] not Electro and then for bloom
[02:23:07] you would have to have like three hydros
[02:23:10] and then if you're doing that it's kind
[02:23:12] of copium so I wouldn't
[02:23:16] like I mentioned it in my video because
[02:23:17] like if you want to do it just go yeah
[02:23:19] but like it's hot
[02:23:31] please say new and exciting jokes
[02:23:38] laughs
[02:23:42] Okay so
[02:23:44] a guy walks up to a dock right
[02:23:48] and then the duck is like he's like he's
[02:23:51] just chilling and then the guy's like
[02:23:52] hey what's quacking
[02:23:57] is like quack
[02:24:02] [Music]
[02:24:10] get it because like the Ducks say quack
[02:24:12] right and like cracking like oh what's
[02:24:13] cracking because
[02:24:24] you owe me a trial I can't wait to try
[02:24:27] Romeo
[02:24:32] okay so we're gonna play yunjin
[02:24:36] Joe
[02:24:42] all right we'll set up we'll set up
[02:24:43] we'll set up we'll set up all our boosts
[02:24:49] all right we're actually on the
[02:24:50] Thundering pulse or Mia wait there's
[02:24:52] actually a Lydia
[02:24:59] I just [ __ ] unloaded my whole combo
[02:25:01] without an e oh
[02:25:09] ow
[02:25:12] wow wait what a 14 ping here how's my
[02:25:15] ping better here than at home
[02:25:34] your circus was so cute yeah apparently
[02:25:36] it was we should probably do it but I
[02:25:37] don't know if I'll stream I'll probably
[02:25:38] watch that
[02:25:39] wait where is it this thing I'm gonna
[02:25:41] unlock it I have it
[02:25:47] bro okay okay well
[02:25:55] this needle trigger Bountiful cores and
[02:25:57] double double team okay first of all
[02:25:59] never call it the double double team
[02:26:00] again but no she's not supposed to like
[02:26:03] sometimes you'll accidentally proc some
[02:26:04] but it's never optimal for newly to proc
[02:26:06] looms because you want nearly to stack
[02:26:08] HP and you want someone else's not bloom
[02:26:11] why is there a chest here
[02:26:15] there's probably a lore behind this
[02:26:16] chest but I can't remember
[02:26:19] who says there aren't benefits
[02:26:25] foreign
[02:26:41] yeah I think I remember it being
[02:26:42] annoying or some [ __ ]
[02:26:44] I just didn't open it
[02:26:46] dude some chests deserve to be better
[02:26:48] than common it's not my fault also
[02:26:49] there's a luxurious one here though I
[02:26:51] don't know why
[02:26:52] the [ __ ] did I get it
[02:26:55] oh my God I can't believe he still
[02:26:57] didn't get it
[02:27:00] I remember what I said I was gonna be
[02:27:02] quiet I'll be quiet
[02:27:03] sometimes it's best to be quiet actually
[02:27:05] sometimes in life like you gotta know
[02:27:07] when to when when to listen Went to went
[02:27:10] to move in silence
[02:27:15] right Fang
[02:27:17] thing
[02:27:34] are you
[02:27:38] here to play with me
[02:27:41] that's thanks Tyson mage
[02:27:48] Falling Leaves
[02:27:50] kikiara Loki Slavs it does
[02:27:53] I think he dude key like he first came
[02:27:56] out and like you laugh at it because
[02:27:58] it's a [ __ ] HP weapon for one
[02:27:59] character but then they've released like
[02:28:00] 86 sword characters that want HP and
[02:28:03] they release no [ __ ] four star sword
[02:28:05] characters so there's two options either
[02:28:06] they're trying to sell Ki or font 10's
[02:28:09] gonna come out four star craftable sword
[02:28:12] La Baguette vital which is going to give
[02:28:15] HP as a craftable weapon on top of
[02:28:17] giving energy to your whole team scaling
[02:28:19] on your max HP
[02:28:20] and then it's above
[02:28:23] so realistically that'll happen if not
[02:28:24] then key is broken
[02:28:26] so for now don't pull key wait for font
[02:28:29] 10 4 star sword if not if it doesn't go
[02:28:31] out then Pokey true I low-key wish I had
[02:28:33] key but all good
[02:28:35] not for nilu though neither is as best
[02:28:36] as doll blade
[02:28:42] why does he sound normal
[02:28:44] I have always sounded normal your
[02:28:46] imagination just projected your uh
[02:28:49] Insanity onto me I've always been sane
[02:28:52] I have three resin
[02:28:56] we will have good artifacts so that we
[02:28:58] can level

[02:29:12] you know what might as well actually
[02:29:14] that feather wasn't bad we probably
[02:29:15] should get oh
[02:29:19] yo wait I have to be quiet I have to be
[02:29:22] quiet but yo
[02:29:23] this is actually good what the [ __ ]
[02:29:27] yo what the hell

[02:29:31] [ __ ] Vermillion
[02:29:35] let me cook let me cook let me cook
[02:29:37] don't count a chicken before it hatches
[02:29:43] yo this could be really good
[02:29:51] oh [ __ ]
[02:29:53] wait this is really good what the [ __ ]
[02:29:56] boom 10 credits

[02:33:33] never know which [ __ ] game to stream
[02:33:36] or make videos on like there's [ __ ]
[02:33:38] so much I never know actually it's hard
[02:33:40] to tell which one people are more
[02:33:41] interested in I've just been doing both
[02:33:43] like I mean I like both but I don't know
[02:33:46] I care about the viewer experience
[02:33:48] I'm happy doing whatever dude I'll
[02:33:50] [ __ ] stream myself eating eating

[02:34:09] videos on that but
[02:34:21] I'm determined to get a good artifact
[02:34:26] watch the xyox edits nope I will do
[02:34:29] viewers submitted tick tocks but or
[02:34:30] YouTube videos whatever but it will not
[02:34:32] be the ziox edits those that's not what
[02:34:35] we're trying to add that is not what
[02:34:36] we're trying to review
[02:34:38] what no I don't want you to do it
[02:34:42] because then that means more edits of of
[02:34:44] that
[02:35:03] oh this could be good
[02:35:04] [Music]
[02:35:05] never just doomed actually maybe today's
[02:35:07] not the day okay this could be good

[02:35:40] it's new we're gonna first try it and we
[02:35:43] might make it into a video like we might
[02:35:44] do like a randomized or some [ __ ] like
[02:35:46] with the last one but that one hasn't
[02:35:47] been released yet but I probably
[02:35:49] released that one and then make a new
[02:35:50] one good take
[02:35:56] disparage yeah I mean would be a good

[02:39:33] do like a randomizer spin the wheel of
[02:39:35] death and then ruin our account and
[02:39:37] that's gonna be a video next of this is
[02:39:39] gonna be a banger video and I want to do
[02:39:41] a video either completing my my shower
[02:39:44] Vermillion build or farming for fokalore
[02:39:47] in the new Hydro domain one of those two
[02:39:51] could be a video with all our resin I
[02:39:52] don't know which one I should do you
[02:39:54] guys can let me know and I'll take this
[02:39:55] suggestion
[02:39:58] also I have some stereo stuff planned
[02:40:00] and some get yourself plan so expect
[02:40:02] both
[02:40:06] um
[02:40:08] yeah this week I'm gonna upload the
[02:40:11] abyss randomizer video we did like
[02:40:13] [ __ ] two months ago super old but
[02:40:15] it's a banger so expect that and a free
[02:40:18] to play account review we did like a
[02:40:19] month ago
[02:40:21] so expect both of those
[02:40:25] yeah
[02:40:28] I think that's the plan
[02:40:30] I was quiet today because I'm streaming
[02:40:31] at a hotel so I'm sorry next stream will
[02:40:34] either be
[02:40:35] I'll be back home in like two or three
[02:40:37] days so it should be that unless I
[02:40:38] decide to stream again here but it would
[02:40:39] be in a different room with actual noise
[02:40:41] canceling so it could be a bit louder
[02:40:42] but it should probably be when I'm back
[02:40:43] home I'll let you guys know
[02:40:46] so I'll see you guys soon thanks so much
[02:40:47] for being here sorry that it was a bit
[02:40:49] of a shorter stream it's only been two
[02:40:51] hours and 40 minutes which is why I
[02:40:53] might try to stream again
[02:40:54] but it should be soon just expect a soon
