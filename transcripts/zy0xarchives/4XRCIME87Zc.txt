[00:21:09] if I don't activate constellations to
[00:21:11] stay relatable and to show normal Kaza

[00:23:51] that I'm wrong but I was reading up I I
[00:23:53] I I read up a little on the [ __ ] on
[00:23:55] the [ __ ] on the [ __ ] on the
[00:23:57] [ __ ] uh uh uh uh Dan Hong lore and I
[00:24:01] know okay I know it's more complicated
[00:24:02] cuz it's like Bou and [ __ ] and whatever
[00:24:04] the [ __ ] but I don't care but dude like
[00:24:07] do you guys know that hung literally
[00:24:10] like lowkey was just like blade you're
[00:24:13] going to die so I'm going to sacrifice
[00:24:16] everything to save you and then they
[00:24:17] like basically curs him by being
[00:24:18] Immortal I know there's like more to it
[00:24:20] than that but basically forces him to be
[00:24:22] immortal and then blade hates him
[00:24:26] now
[00:24:28] yeah we all know this okay but I'm just
[00:24:33] saying I didn't know it was like that
[00:24:35] obvious like I thought it was like I
[00:24:37] thought the fact that they were like on
[00:24:38] a l cone it was like a little like hint
[00:24:40] or something I didn't know they were
[00:24:41] literally like I Didn't Know Dan hung
[00:24:43] like goes to sleep dreaming about
[00:24:47] blade I mean maybe they're just friends
[00:24:49] maybe they're just homies I would do
[00:24:50] that for my
[00:24:56] friends
[00:25:00] Cuts scene Skipper okay I literally paid
[00:25:02] attention to the [ __ ] quests in that
[00:25:04] game okay I just didn't know the details
[00:25:07] of the Dan hung oh I didn't do the
[00:25:08] newest Quest I didn't do the newest one
[00:25:10] the newest one I didn't do so it might
[00:25:11] have been that
[00:25:13] one no you don't okay [ __ ]
[00:25:16] you hey
[00:25:19] bline what I actually don't care now
[00:25:21] that I think about it [ __ ] you we're
[00:25:22] going to go do artifacts cuz that's more
[00:25:24] entertaining and we can uncap our resin
[00:25:25] and then go watch the Stream
[00:25:30] historians will say they're good friends
[00:25:35] true dude what's the
[00:25:37] point okay so I want to say something
[00:25:41] but then I don't know if new people will
[00:25:42] take me
[00:25:43] seriously what's the point of his okay
[00:25:46] dude what's the point of reading if you
[00:25:47] already know things like reading is for
[00:25:50] people who don't know if you know you
[00:25:52] don't need to read cuz you already know
[00:25:56] it it's it's like okay it's like you
[00:25:59] could you could read Bennett's ultimate
[00:26:00] Fantastic Voyage Bennett performs a
[00:26:02] jumping attack that deals power damage
[00:26:04] creating an inspirational field if the
[00:26:05] health of a character within and then
[00:26:07] you could read all that or you could
[00:26:10] just be me and be like field heal and
[00:26:14] attack and then that's it you get
[00:26:16] healing and attack so why read when you
[00:26:19] can know
[00:26:20] things we
[00:26:23] go okay in what if you can't read
[00:26:28] the magic I actually can't read now

[00:31:17] in the anniversary good question good
[00:31:19] question good question here's what I
[00:31:22] think here's what I think anniversary
[00:31:24] rewards what would make players happy
[00:31:26] Primo gems resin or like anything
[00:31:29] relating to that wishes more artifacts
[00:31:31] more whatever no they're they're not
[00:31:33] trying to make us happy they're trying
[00:31:34] to make us satisfied it's like how in
[00:31:36] like a plane they or like they'll make
[00:31:38] it like cold enough for you to be
[00:31:40] annoyed but not cold enough for you to
[00:31:41] get up and do anything that is what they
[00:31:43] want here so we're not going to get like
[00:31:45] Primos maybe a little bit maybe like a
[00:31:46] tenple but here's what I'm thinking
[00:31:49] untradeable rewards right okay we get
[00:31:51] like a glider we get like an event
[00:31:53] weapon maybe maybe maybe a traveler
[00:31:55] outfit genin coming on the switch and
[00:31:57] the anime same time two in one okay that
[00:32:00] could be cool we could get DEA Buffs
[00:32:02] okay Dory could be fed into the strong
[00:32:04] box to delete her from the game but also
[00:32:06] give you a perfect artifact like a self-
[00:32:08] modulating res uh uh piece from honkey
[00:32:10] star rail where you can choose the main
[00:32:12] stat of your piece maybe also substats
[00:32:14] furthermore toggleable constellations
[00:32:16] artifact load out so you no longer have
[00:32:18] to gear for 4 hours straight furthermore
[00:32:20] times two we could also get maybe maybe
[00:32:23] maybe a reward that's like oh today
[00:32:25] today if you do a domain
[00:32:28] you can you can you can choose one set
[00:32:30] instead of two and then you only get
[00:32:31] that set furthermore furthermore during
[00:32:34] the anniversary month for 30 days double
[00:32:37] the res no no they wouldn't give res
[00:32:39] that's cop but the rest Could
[00:32:41] Happen new skins new skins you could get
[00:32:45] think of think of a good Halloween's
[00:32:46] coming up Halloween Chia he has a
[00:32:48] [ __ ] Scythe Reaper boom [ __ ] same
[00:32:50] thing with Hut bow boom [ __ ] nette
[00:32:53] but without his jacket or shirt [ __ ] it
[00:32:56] sorry that was that was a bit more
[00:32:58] copium but the rest could happen now
[00:33:00] realistic okay now let me mute alerts
[00:33:03] cuz this is distracting me I'm sorry I
[00:33:04] appreciate the
[00:33:06] sub more realistic rewards in case
[00:33:08] you're like oh that's copium
[00:33:10] okay a temple the shop reset like a
[00:33:14] glider or like a pet and then a thank
[00:33:18] you from someone it's like Co is going

[00:34:01] since they're standard Banner characters
[00:34:02] are going to The Standard Banner going
[00:34:04] on every like weapon man as well as
[00:34:06] normal weapons cuz Hunter's path pretty
[00:34:07] good re of the beacon of the sea pretty
[00:34:10] good furthermore furthermore furthermore
[00:34:13] deab Buffs but we'll talk about that
[00:34:14] later in the standard Banner now we're
[00:34:17] they're going to add the one point
[00:34:18] whatever characters other than like the
[00:34:20] archons so like they they wouldn't add
[00:34:21] like ventti or whatever or like Jong Lee
[00:34:22] but they'd add like albo CLE [ __ ]
[00:34:25] [ __ ] [ __ ] who else Ula
[00:34:27] [ __ ] cuz Okay at this point dude like
[00:34:30] yeah they're cool characters yeah well
[00:34:32] you know Al's pretty good whatever but
[00:34:33] like no one's no one's like saving their
[00:34:35] PR like yes man I can't wait for the
[00:34:36] next CLE rerun maybe you are if you are
[00:34:38] no disrespect to Cle players I'm just
[00:34:40] saying it probably won't make them that
[00:34:42] much money dude everyone wanted Ula for
[00:34:43] [ __ ] 5 years she came out her Banner
[00:34:45] sold [ __ ] a couch that's it that's
[00:34:47] literally it so it's not profitable for
[00:34:49] them to keep rerunning characters that
[00:34:50] that that are like 1.2 okay so at that
[00:34:52] point just add them to the [ __ ]
[00:34:53] standard maybe rerun oh here's a
[00:34:55] anniversary Banner all the old forgotten
[00:34:57] characters you can pick who to pull for
[00:34:59] that's a new idea write that down write
[00:35:00] that down anniversary Banner write that
[00:35:02] down notice how none of my ideas involve
[00:35:03] Primo jams or resen because I know
[00:35:05] that's not happening true is this going
[00:35:07] to start it's almost 7:30 I can only
[00:35:08] talk for so long I'm
[00:35:10] just anyways those are good ideas so
[00:35:18] true we get the new seals in our teapot
[00:35:21] and then you can you can pet them oh my
[00:35:23] God you can pet every every animal in G
[00:35:26] back you can pet
[00:35:28] them yeah I'm making sure it's running

[00:35:32] not looking at genin official chat okay

[00:58:10] on top with a cut half facing up top the
[00:58:13] cut Bri with your fruity nutty bacon mix
[00:58:16] and top with the other half God kind of
[00:58:18] like a sandwich if you have any extra
[00:58:21] just lay it in a circle around your Bree
[00:58:23] use your beaten egg to coat the pastry
[00:58:26] then fold it up over the top of your
[00:58:27] Bree like you're wrapping a present you
[00:58:29] want to completely cover the Bree with
[00:58:31] no gaps in the pastry place the top and
[00:58:34] pinch it shut removing the excess pastry
[00:58:37] dough finally coat the pastry's exterior
[00:58:40] in your eggwash and bake until golden
[00:58:42] brown and
[00:58:43] Flaky cheesy Savory and a little bit
[00:58:46] sweet Bri onute is perfect for sharing
[00:58:50] and the best part is that you can fill
[00:58:52] it with just about anything try it with
[00:58:54] rosemary and figs caramelized onion and
[00:58:56] ham or if you're really daring sweet
[00:58:59] chili pepper green onion

[01:23:16] pet happy anniversary genin impact my
[01:23:19] name is Ben balmaa and as the voice of
[01:23:22] cave
[01:23:23] I'm always looking for better ways to
[01:23:24] integrate artistic expression and
[01:23:26] practical functionality I'm so happy to
[01:23:29] be celebrating the three-year
[01:23:32] anniversary for deleting our [ __ ]
[01:23:34] world without
[01:23:36] decorations well inspired by the
[01:23:38] enchanting Landscapes of tat here's a
[01:23:41] fun and functional craft that can really
[01:23:43] add a mystical vibe to a celebration in
[01:23:45] a matter of minutes if you have any
[01:23:47] mason jars lying around they can easily
[01:23:49] be transformed into Fantastical yet
[01:23:51] functional lanterns
[01:23:53] all you need is some small battery
[01:23:54] powered LED lights art supplies and some
[01:23:57] creative thinking decorate the glass
[01:24:00] with glitter for a nebula jar or make
[01:24:02] your own designs inspired by the world
[01:24:04] of tat with colorful paper paint string
[01:24:07] or even maple leaves and place the LED
[01:24:10] lights like a battery powered tealight
[01:24:12] or fairy light inside the Mason jar the
[01:24:15] light will pass through the different
[01:24:17] shapes and colors to give it a unique
[01:24:19] and enchanting glow yeah that's looking
[01:24:21] pretty good
[01:24:23] and the fun doesn't stop there Jenny has
[01:24:25] another DIY project that can add a lot
[01:24:27] of color to any genin theme celebration
[01:24:30] that right Jenn hey that's right I'm
[01:24:33] Jenny okori wishing all the fans and
[01:24:35] players a very happy thir year
[01:24:37] anniversary well as the voice of Yia you
[01:24:41] know I have a soft spot for colorful
[01:24:42] bursting light displays and we can
[01:24:44] easily make our own decorations by
[01:24:46] turning the average balloon into
[01:24:48] explosive slimes all you need is a
[01:24:51] couple of colorful balloons confetti and
[01:24:54] some art supplies take your deflated
[01:24:57] balloon and fill it with either homemade
[01:24:59] or store bot confetti a funnel can
[01:25:02] really come in handy here next use a
[01:25:05] balloon pump to inflate the balloon
[01:25:07] regular air allows them to bounce around
[01:25:09] the room but if you want a floating
[01:25:12] enimo slime you'll need to use helium
[01:25:15] shape the Slime into a sphere by letting
[01:25:17] out a little air and tie off the end
[01:25:21] then go ahead and add some white eyes
[01:25:24] and any other details you'd like to give
[01:25:26] the Slime a personality you can use
[01:25:28] white paint or paper for these eyes now
[01:25:32] not only do you have some fun slime
[01:25:34] balloon decorations but when they pop
[01:25:38] they'll explode in a burst of colorful
[01:25:40] confetti condensate these balloons and
[01:25:43] starlight jar decorations can level up
[01:25:45] any genin party as we celebrate this
[01:25:47] three-year achievement I look forward to
[01:25:49] seeing what you create I look forward to
[01:25:52] seeing you

[01:47:19] for being a part of it
[01:47:20] thank you my favorite genin memory of
[01:47:22] the past year was baiju becoming a
[01:47:25] playable character that was so
[01:47:29] exciting a relasing him like the most
[01:47:32] dead zone of the Dead
[01:47:34] Z all good I still like Day saying
[01:47:37] though that's absolutely my favorite
[01:47:39] memory of the past year timing of the
[01:47:40] release wasn't ideal all good hey there
[01:47:42] my name is na Tara and I play all haam
[01:47:44] in genin Impact what is your favorite
[01:47:46] story from the are we still going out
[01:47:47] tonight or the infamous traitor traitor
[01:47:51] AAR anger scene that all ha them has uh
[01:47:55] just because it was really fun seeing
[01:47:57] the reception to that and it was very
[01:47:59] fun recording you know it's all haam is
[01:48:01] very reserved very kind of to himself so
[01:48:04] having this one moment where he breaks
[01:48:07] character putting on an act of course
[01:48:09] but still like showing more emotion than
[01:48:11] anyone has ever seen him do was very fun
[01:48:15] to kind of go
[01:48:16] into in terms of the game the I want to
[01:48:20] say is congratulations for going you
[01:48:23] know three plus years strong yeah the
[01:48:25] the world that they've managed to build
[01:48:28] is nothing short of impressive and also
[01:48:31] seeing the sort of fans admiration
[01:48:33] toward the game is you know nothing
[01:48:36] short of delightful really because there
[01:48:38] is just such an enthusiasm and such a
[01:48:40] passion with the fan base so seeing this
[01:48:42] sort of relationship between the two is
[01:48:45] endearing and the fact that I get to you
[01:48:47] know kind of share in both of these
[01:48:49] experiences is
[01:48:52] awesome hey what's up I'm Zach Gordon I
[01:48:54] am the voice of tinari if I have one
[01:48:58] anniversary message it's I can't wait
[01:49:00] till the next year and the year after
[01:49:02] that and I hope to be around for uh as
[01:49:05] long as we all enjoy the game so thank
[01:49:08] you what is something you like or admire
[01:49:11] about your
[01:49:12] character one thing that if I may say so
[01:49:15] myself I I feel like we worked really
[01:49:17] hard to do
[01:49:18] well was
[01:49:21] his ability to care about kie and I
[01:49:24] think that a lot of people that
[01:49:27] really what they and feel that they're
[01:49:30] very intelligent quote unquote I'll I
[01:49:34] think sometimes the ego can get in the
[01:49:35] way of that and one thing that I really
[01:49:38] admire about tinari is that he's able to
[01:49:42] put that aside and and really focus on
[01:49:44] what matters which is being able to
[01:49:47] articulate and and translate what he
[01:49:49] knows
[01:49:51] and pass it on to a student or an
[01:49:54] apprentice somebody like Kay a
[01:49:57] good it all up compion think tyari is a
[01:50:00] very compassionate individual we
[01:50:03] certainly tried our best Infuse that
[01:50:05] into the
[01:50:07] role my name is Ben Bala I voice cave do
[01:50:10] you have an anniversary message you'd
[01:50:12] like to share after seeing genin when it
[01:50:15] first came out I had no doubt that it
[01:50:17] was going to be something special and it
[01:50:19] was going to stand the test of time
[01:50:21] there's so much potential to be had into
[01:50:24] that and like so many new people to meet
[01:50:26] and and places to explore and travel to
[01:50:30] the game's just a gem and like as far as
[01:50:32] people that have helped me get this far

[01:51:16] sound cliche but I'm really super
[01:51:18] grateful to be part of this what is your
[01:51:20] favorite story from the past year oh my
[01:51:24] favorite my favorite scene oh gosh
[01:51:27] there's so many ah it's like the boss
[01:51:30] battle the when I first saw the boss
[01:51:33] battle when I was doing the session I
[01:51:34] was like this is going to be insane and
[01:51:37] the the boss battle theme oh my gosh
[01:51:40] that was just like insane but then I was
[01:51:45] like straight on his head looking right
[01:51:49] at you poof
[01:51:51] yeah that was kind of sad but it was
[01:51:54] kind of a was my favorite
[01:51:56] one hi I'm anco I voice Ryden shogen and
[01:52:01] a I met she was cool and a handful of
[01:52:05] NPCs I can't believe that genin impact

[01:52:13] excited for what the future holds for

[01:52:37] playing thank you for loving this game
[01:52:40] what's one of your favorite character
[01:52:42] lines okay I get asked this a lot and
[01:52:45] the answer is the about EO line
[01:52:50] who about I just think it's so funny how
[01:52:54] in one word you get to know exactly what
[01:52:57] Ryden Shogun think just
[01:53:00] who
[01:53:02] harako that never fails to make Mega
[01:53:07] him hi my name is Kimberly Anne Campbell
[01:53:10] and I'm the voice of Nita the dentro
[01:53:12] archon in genin Impact what was your
[01:53:14] favorite memory of the past year I
[01:53:16] said are a lot and no surprise there a
[01:53:21] lot to do with niita but I would say
[01:53:24] that one of my favorite memories from
[01:53:25] last year would have to be when Nita's
[01:53:29] trailer dropped she has two trailers but
[01:53:31] the one in particular that comes to mind
[01:53:33] is the one where she's going through her
[01:53:35] birthday over and over again and it
[01:53:37] starts off as happy and then it's like
[01:53:39] okay it's still kind of happy but then
[01:53:41] it gets really dark and like really
[01:53:44] depressing and even though it's like a
[01:53:47] really sad video it was like like super
[01:53:50] well done and I was like oh my gosh this
[01:53:52] is so good
[01:53:55] and we going to deal from like streamers
[01:53:58] YouTubers it was like just amazing to
[01:54:01] see everybody's reaction to it I could
[01:54:02] not wait for it to come out there you go
[01:54:04] turned out as well as it
[01:54:07] did well there you have it folks
[01:54:09] straight from the mouths of some of our
[01:54:11] favorite characters it's isn't there
[01:54:14] someone you've forgotten two someone's
[01:54:16] to be exact yeah oh oh I I was told
[01:54:19] about to get to you guys I swear right
[01:54:22] that's what
[01:54:24] I can you give us a short intro my name
[01:54:27] is Damon Mills and I voice Linny the
[01:54:29] greatest magician in all to that is
[01:54:32] there anything you want to say to the
[01:54:33] community about your character I think
[01:54:35] Linny and Lynette's story is quite
[01:54:37] fascinating because they're both
[01:54:39] incredibly fun characters and all about
[01:54:42] razzled Dazzle but their Collective past
[01:54:45] is so dark and painful I mean they both
[01:54:48] mask it really well particularly Lenny
[01:54:50] who appears front-facing very confident
[01:54:53] but he's burdened by his ties to the
[01:54:55] fouille growing up as an orphan kind of
[01:54:58] acting as a parent to his siblings kind
[01:55:01] spoilers but all good I feel like he was
[01:55:02] forced to grow up really fast and just
[01:55:06] like do you have an anniversary message
[01:55:07] you'd like to share I still remember
[01:55:09] when genin first came around and I
[01:55:11] thought it was the neatest concept I
[01:55:13] know this game has gotten so many people
[01:55:15] through so much stuff and I'm really
[01:55:17] excited to finally be a part of it in
[01:55:19] such a big way it's really special to me
[01:55:22] and I can't wait to see where the rest
[01:55:23] of the game
[01:55:25] goes I know my name is and I the voice
[01:55:28] of Lynette and I actually adore cats so
[01:55:32] this is a true honor is there anything
[01:55:34] you want to say to the community about
[01:55:36] your character yeah uh Lynette Lynette
[01:55:39] is really fun for me because you know
[01:55:43] she is the the Dead Pan kind of I guess
[01:55:48] emotionless character archetype but we
[01:55:50] did try to elevate her from that um so
[01:55:54] it's really fun uh trying to you know
[01:55:59] keep that feel that base feel of her
[01:56:02] being dead pan but also adding enough
[01:56:04] Nuance so that she is an interesting
[01:56:07] character do you have an anniversary
[01:56:09] message you'd like to share yeah 3 years
[01:56:11] that's crazy um I'm very excited I'm
[01:56:15] excited to see future characters I'm
[01:56:16] excited to see more Fontaine um and more
[01:56:20] Lynette of course uh and um yeah I want
[01:56:24] to thank you guys for being so
[01:56:25] supportive and stuff um it's uh it's
[01:56:29] been a blast and I can't wait to see you
[01:56:32] guys a blast CLE jumpty Dumpty we're
[01:56:35] getting CLE for free watch there you

[02:01:50] [Music]
[02:01:52] good that is really good uh these
[02:01:54] weapons I don't know what the [ __ ] they
[02:01:55] do but
[02:01:58] cool um this one's called the range
[02:02:07] gauge
[02:02:09] okay that's
[02:02:11] cool uh what else is there where are the
[02:02:13] anniversary rewards actually let's look
[02:02:15] at what what [ __ ] nette does dude
[02:02:17] this [ __ ] floats and says and
[02:02:20] then
[02:02:20] he he [ __ ] hydr on
[02:02:25] you bank or somewhere similarly
[02:02:31] [Music]
[02:02:33] flui that
[02:02:35] sick
[02:02:37] [Music]
[02:02:39] silence be
[02:02:42] Sanctified those bubbles synergize with
[02:02:44] Hydro MC POG Hydro MC is going to be
[02:02:47] that is so [ __ ] dude dude dude dude
[02:02:49] dude there's no way they literally made
[02:02:51] him whip it out did I not call this he
[02:02:53] literally just whips it
[02:02:54] [Music]
[02:03:01] out the only other prediction now all
[02:03:03] they need dude imagine so they do that
[02:03:05] now the next next p are like oh oh guess
[02:03:07] what guess what uh we're actually
[02:03:09] confirming that the [ __ ] Dane's Leaf
[02:03:11] is coming out and going to damage all
[02:03:13] your party members making Vermillion the
[02:03:14] best on every character and then Z how
[02:03:16] would I be so right so many times
[02:03:20] let me take a screenshot of
[02:03:22] this
[02:03:25] [Music]
[02:03:27] Sanctified need this that look so sick
[02:03:29] wait no this one's better [ __ ] I missed
[02:03:32] it I like that he floats wait where's
[02:03:34] the like actually pre actual preview cuz
[02:03:36] I feel like you can move around during
[02:03:38] it or is that during his charge wait I
[02:03:40] actually don't know what that is is that
[02:03:41] a Char attack or a skill see
[02:03:47] right
[02:03:55] dude what the [ __ ] is
[02:04:01] this can I play with Shang
[02:04:11] Ling that's pretty
[02:04:17] sick
[02:04:19] actually you could probably I know he's
[02:04:20] probably not made for nuu but you can
[02:04:22] probably because he's like a range Hydro
[02:04:24] dude you can probably stay far from the
[02:04:26] N Bloom so you you don't [ __ ] die
[02:04:28] through your
[02:04:29] blooms you looks cool
[02:04:34] [Music]
[02:04:42] though I don't get how he works I mean
[02:04:45] me neither but it's probably use your
[02:04:47] skill burst and you charge attack and
[02:04:48] like like walk cuz this is charge attack
[02:04:51] so you probably want to be charge
[02:04:51] attacking as much as you can unless it's
[02:04:54] bad but it shouldn't be bad so you
[02:04:55] probably just want to do that the whole
[02:04:58] time uh Source water droplets that net
[02:05:01] absorb will increase the formation speed
[02:05:02] of his Seal Seal creat charge up his
[02:05:05] charge attack and will heal nette if the
[02:05:06] seal has been formed charge ATT
[02:05:08] Equitable judgment will be Unleashed
[02:05:10] dealing continuous Hydro damage in a
[02:05:11] straight line in front of
[02:05:17] them wait what
[02:05:23] okay because there's something that
[02:05:24] heals him there is a
[02:05:27] chance that this
[02:05:32] means that he might damage himself which
[02:05:34] might mean that the magos set is good on
[02:05:36] him so we're going to f that set there
[02:05:37] is no leaks here just purely suspicion
[02:05:39] because why else would he [ __ ] heal
[02:05:40] himself so there's a good chance it's
[02:05:42] true also he's being ran alongside Hut
[02:05:45] silly CH hilly CH who also does that
[02:05:51] so it's a nice way to
[02:05:54] assume that it might work on him which
[02:05:56] means that when we Farm golden troop and
[02:05:58] Mar it will be for him and I can make a
[02:06:00] video out of
[02:06:02] that he is a charge attacker looks like
[02:06:06] what is the time stamp so that I can
[02:06:07] keep this for my intro I don't
[02:06:10] know two hours and six I not that
[02:06:16] down they said his Char consumes HP did
[02:06:19] they where I thought they just chatter
[02:06:21] and
[02:06:27] stuff oh
[02:06:30] oh Net's charge attack will continuously
[02:06:33] consume HP confirmed in the special
[02:06:35] program before he's out that means
[02:06:37] there's a good chance he uses Mari CH
[02:06:39] because he loses HP also wants to charge
[02:06:41] ATT probably going to be the best that
[02:06:42] on him we don't know what he scales on
[02:06:44] we don't know attack HP defense we don't
[02:06:46] know but that looks good therefore it's
[02:06:48] probably going to be good so we're going
[02:06:49] to prearm for it and that's why I'm
[02:06:51] going to farm uh Mari and golden
[02:06:54] troop also for fishal and lny but
[02:07:15] yeah the higher the n's current HP the
[02:07:17] more damage his charge tracks
[02:07:19] is that a percentage is that an
[02:07:38] [Music]
[02:07:45] amount okay okay he says he says he said
[02:07:48] listen listen listen our boy Michael
[02:07:50] actually I don't know who this is but
[02:07:51] someone
[02:07:55] said
[02:07:56] wait wait let me
[02:08:08] cook where is
[02:08:10] it did I miss it oh my God I missed it I
[02:08:13] missed it I missed it no no oh there it
[02:08:17] is they also said the higher n's current
[02:08:20] HP the more damage he deals with the sh
[02:08:22] attacks which I am guessing means he
[02:08:24] wants HP a lot of Hydra characters want
[02:08:26] HP so it's reasonable to assume I can go
[02:08:28] Mar look for HP uh crit Hydro all that
[02:08:30] stuff but we don't know we don't know we
[02:08:31] don't know we
[02:08:33] don't it's good to have a a starting
[02:08:36] point
[02:08:41] though cool
[02:08:43] sure an adult around to help you with

[02:11:36] [ __ ] dude they literally they literally
[02:11:38] said hey we're going to make Vermilion
[02:11:41] actually work on characters other than
[02:11:42] just Shia but instead these characters
[02:11:44] want HP or some [ __ ] so they're making a
[02:11:45] use set for it they literally power CB
[02:11:49] [Music]
[02:11:56] for only [ __ ]

[02:12:48] will be amazing when Dan sf's ability
[02:12:50] void prism coock will damage all your

[02:12:55] new ability actually comes out before
[02:12:57] days Leaf characters in Fontan drain
[02:12:59] their own HP okay we saw this with
[02:13:00] rizzly coming out and with nette coming
[02:13:02] out they drain their own HP but for some
[02:13:04] reason they release a low-key better set
[02:13:06] with [ __ ] Mari chose that's more
[02:13:08] versatile and also works on HP scaling
[02:13:10] characters and now what's the point of
[02:13:12] verm million did I waste over 100,000
[02:13:13] resin as a Shain for one

[02:18:28] logical your thoughts you think she
[02:18:30] plays with
[02:18:34] silverwolf that was cool though I mean
[02:18:36] she looks cool I was kind of waiting for
[02:18:37] like the show of like the big old and
[02:18:39] they did it but it was like while she
[02:18:40] was talking so I kind of but it's cool
[02:18:42] she looks hype I already pre-formed for
[02:18:44] her so I'm excited in our own
[02:18:46] hands
[02:18:51] be vigilant of three things fire theft
[02:18:54] and S no like preservation mats and [ __ ]
[02:18:56] and the new boss it's not sus it's not
[02:18:58] hard to tell what she's going to need
[02:19:00] there's a new [ __ ] boss and there's
[02:19:02] mats last

[02:19:38] like lowkey Auto battling world five and
[02:19:40] I cleared it but we're going to do it
[02:19:41] again with like a legit build and don't
[02:19:44] worry I I'll stream it next stream dude
[02:19:46] I literally just Auto battled it I

[02:19:50] lucky but it's fine well I'll stream it
[02:19:51] next stream it is what it is we'll talk

[02:26:29] or than for three
[02:26:34] months your least favorite cookie flavor
[02:26:36] I actually don't know what what's a bad
[02:26:40] cookie I don't even know if there's any
[02:26:42] cookie I dislike I okay this is going to
[02:26:45] be a bad take but I like oatmeal cookies
[02:26:47] so much that I feel like when people add
[02:26:48] raisins to them it makes it worse I
[02:26:49] don't even dislike raisins but it just
[02:26:51] pisses me off it's like dude it's so
[02:26:52] much better without it what are you
[02:26:53] doing with your
[02:26:55] life butes the I don't even think
[02:26:59] they're bad I still think like I still
[02:27:01] think they're good it's
[02:27:03] just actually no let me okay this is
[02:27:06] going to be a terrible take you guys are
[02:27:08] get mad at me my [ __ ] my like College
[02:27:12] High School whatever the CP it's called
[02:27:13] like in the middle had like FR baked
[02:27:17] oatmeal cookies and they're good and
[02:27:18] then sometimes there's oatmeal cookies
[02:27:19] that had chocolate chips in them and it
[02:27:21] just pissed me off because like dude who
[02:27:23] the [ __ ] why that doesn't even synergize
[02:27:25] well it's like you're playing [ __ ]
[02:27:26] Neu and you slap cookie in there it
[02:27:28] doesn't make [ __ ] sense make a
[02:27:30] chocolate chip cookie that's great make
[02:27:31] an oatmeal cookie that's great why are
[02:27:33] there random chocolate chips that have
[02:27:34] no
[02:27:35] Synergy it wasn't bad it's just it was
[02:27:38] worse than the original [ __ ] omo
[02:27:40] ones here but I know that no one's going
[02:27:43] to agree with this take cuz Everyone
[02:27:44] likes chocolate chips cuz they're
[02:27:45] chocolate oh my God God chocolate
[02:27:48] chips now
[02:27:52] disappear that's a circular granola bar
[02:27:55] I gu I mean yeah I
[02:27:58] guess one with
[02:28:03] nature yes here I'm not going to fight
[02:28:06] for this opinion cuz I don't even think
[02:28:07] I'm right I just I don't
[02:28:10] know I don't even think I'm right it's
[02:28:12] just I feel like people are corrupting a
[02:28:13] good
[02:28:15] thing
[02:28:17] it's like okay okay like okay
[02:28:19] listen I think like adding chicken to
[02:28:21] most things you know it's a good way to
[02:28:22] get some protein and it usually tastes
[02:28:24] pretty good right but I feel like a lot
[02:28:25] of times some like lesser good places
[02:28:29] will like you'll ask you'll get like a
[02:28:30] salad right and you'll get like chicken
[02:28:31] with it and then they'll just add like
[02:28:33] Bland ass unflavored ass disgusting
[02:28:35] chicken that just makes the whole thing
[02:28:36] worse like sometimes it's like oh nice I
[02:28:38] get you know additional [ __ ] meat and
[02:28:40] it's good but like it's like there's
[02:28:42] something that's good and they just add
[02:28:44] some random Bland [ __ ] on it and then
[02:28:45] you're like pissed and that's how
[02:28:47] cookies being ruined by some random
[02:28:49] thing if you have any questions about
[02:28:51] schizophrenia or wait what what's that
[02:28:59] Dono what's her take on mint chocolate
[02:29:02] chip uh I can't remember the last time I
[02:29:05] had it I actually like mint though I
[02:29:08] like mint I love
[02:29:13] mint my grandma grows mint leaves so
[02:29:15] some I just nibble on mint
[02:29:18] I'm a mint enjoyer like I don't I don't
[02:29:20] order mint stuff I don't but I like like
[02:29:22] mint tea and mint
[02:29:24] like in like manushi we when we get that
[02:29:27] like a lemones pizza we put like a bunch
[02:29:29] of toppings I always put mint in it like
[02:29:31] mint and olives but that's just that's
[02:29:33] just me I was raised on
[02:29:37] mint minty is not the same as mint
[02:29:39] chocolate okay but like I like mint so
[02:29:41] even in [ __ ] where people are like oh my
[02:29:42] God I hate mint chocolate I just like it
[02:29:44] cuz I like mint but it's not like I
[02:29:45] don't go out of my way to get it
[02:29:51] it also if you want mint chocolate just
[02:29:53] eat just brush your teeth and then eat
[02:29:55] dark chocolate and then it's free eat
[02:29:57] chocolate then brush your teeth after
[02:29:59] don't swallow the toothpaste but it's
[02:30:01] just free mint flavoring you're welcome
[02:30:03] you're welcome you're welcome you're
[02:30:05] welcome I Harvard wants to know your
[02:30:12] location not the same flavor I mean okay
[02:30:15] you're right but
[02:30:17] I still like it I don't
[02:30:18] know I had mint soft serve once which
[02:30:21] was really good but I think the
[02:30:23] chocolate I don't know I'm not dude is
[02:30:25] it weird that I'm a chocolate flavor
[02:30:27] hater like it's not that I hate
[02:30:28] chocolate but it's like if you come home
[02:30:31] after a long day of work and your go-to
[02:30:33] is a bowl of just chocolate ice cream
[02:30:36] it's like what are you doing with your
[02:30:38] like there's so many better flavors you
[02:30:40] could have [ __ ] you could even
[02:30:41] strawberry dude you can have chocolate
[02:30:43] with you have like cookie dough you like
[02:30:44] birthday cake you have a [ __ ] French
[02:30:45] vanilla you get a [ __ ] caramel you
[02:30:47] get you you even mix chocolate with
[02:30:49] things who just has like normal
[02:30:50] chocolate flavor it's not even bad it's
[02:30:53] just like what's wrong with that's like
[02:30:55] sociopathic
[02:30:59] Behavior like I like chocolate it's dude
[02:31:02] I eat chocolate I like chocolate but
[02:31:03] like I don't
[02:31:06] know strawberry so bad well I like
[02:31:09] strawberry but I also don't buy like
[02:31:11] plain strawberry ice cream I just if
[02:31:14] okay if I'm eating neopolitan ice cream
[02:31:16] chocolate's the last one to go I'm sorry
[02:31:19] I'm sorry I'm sorry also chocolate is
[02:31:21] overpowering it's a strong [ __ ]
[02:31:22] flavor so let's say you're eating like a
[02:31:24] bunch of different flavors of ice cream
[02:31:25] and you have chocolate then the rest of
[02:31:26] your mouth is just [ __ ] chocolate
[02:31:27] then the next thing you have is [ __ ]
[02:31:29] chocolate
[02:31:45] this
[02:31:48] like Okay who in their right mind orders
[02:31:51] chocolate milkshake I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:31:55] you get vanilla you can get [ __ ]
[02:31:57] cookies and cream you get even
[02:31:58] strawberry if you're like oh my God I
[02:31:59] love straw who's just
[02:32:02] like I'm sorry yeah chocolate peanut
[02:32:05] butter is goated I I think chocolate is
[02:32:07] a good combo starter but it needs
[02:32:09] something else it's kind of like it's
[02:32:10] kind of like Kookie right it's like you
[02:32:12] want to play with like hyper Bloom but
[02:32:14] if you're just playing like kie as like
[02:32:16] a Electro carry in like electrocharge
[02:32:18] it's like it's like it's okay but it's
[02:32:20] like
[02:32:21] why just hyper blo man just hyper
[02:32:25] blo chocolate that bad in Canada maybe
[02:32:28] maybe dude actually no I
[02:32:31] mean yeah I don't
[02:32:37] know I think I think it's only with ice
[02:32:40] cream as my take I think chocolate in
[02:32:41] general is good I think chocolate and
[02:32:42] ice cream is not bad actually no that's
[02:32:45] not even the right take chocolate with
[02:32:46] things in ice cream is good chocolate
[02:32:48] alone in ice cream it's like I just want
[02:32:49] to shoot myself in
[02:32:51] game dude it's just like oh I'm just
[02:32:53] tasting [ __ ] this one same flavor
[02:32:55] that I taste all the time it tastes
[02:32:56] generic as [ __ ] is this chocolate wow
[02:33:00] chocolate but chocolate with chocolate
[02:33:02] banana chocolate peanut butter chocolate
[02:33:04] [ __ ] anything usually is
[02:33:11] good yeah it's like a monoch chocolate
[02:33:14] team like you're not it's like if you're
[02:33:16] playing mono Hydro you might as well add
[02:33:19] a [ __ ] Electro charact or like a
[02:33:20] something character and then you have a
[02:33:21] reaction if you're playing they say
[02:33:22] Electro say Hydro I don't know what I
[02:33:23] said if you're playing mono cryo it's
[02:33:25] like yeah it could be better against
[02:33:26] bosses but you might as well just
[02:33:27] [ __ ] play a freeze team usually right
[02:33:29] unless it's like a big [ __ ]
[02:33:30] unfreezable [ __ ] massive man you
[02:33:33] might as well just put a hydro in there
[02:33:34] that's kind of how I feel about
[02:33:35] chocolate it's like monoch chocolate ice
[02:33:37] cream I think there's just better
[02:33:39] options meta wise but if if that's what
[02:33:41] you like have fun you know that's what I
[02:33:43] think please just end the stream at Zio
[02:33:51] I'm
[02:33:52] sorry flavor
[02:33:56] resonance
[02:33:59] well what's the anemo flavor Animo is
[02:34:02] kind of like vanilla cuz you can mix it
[02:34:04] in and it doesn't overpower like if you
[02:34:06] have like let's say banana with vanilla
[02:34:08] right it's just banana but like a bit
[02:34:09] sweeter a little vanilla but banana with
[02:34:11] chocolate it's like a whole new flavor
[02:34:12] it's still good I like banana chocolate
[02:34:14] but it's like a whole new flavor but
[02:34:15] vanilla like you can add it in any team
[02:34:17] kind of like an Nemo you add it in a
[02:34:18] team it swirls it up it doesn't ruin the
[02:34:20] team okay chocolate okay chocolate's
[02:34:23] good but let's say you're playing like a
[02:34:24] let's say you're playing a team that
[02:34:25] like does not want the chocolate
[02:34:27] reaction chocolate can come overpower it
[02:34:29] you just taste chocolate it ruins it
[02:34:30] sometimes it's great but long as it
[02:34:32] overpowers it whereas anemo like vanilla
[02:34:35] is not really going to hurt you you
[02:34:36] don't adding vanilla to something
[02:34:38] doesn't really ruin it you're rarely
[02:34:40] going to ruin something with
[02:34:42] vanilla that's an emo when are you when
[02:34:45] is Kazo going to ruin a
[02:34:48] team what is chocolate Gio no but
[02:34:51] chocolate is good but it's like needed
[02:34:54] in specific teams only what is the ICD
[02:34:56] on chocolate reactions to avoid being a
[02:34:58] psychopath I think chocolate's Kookie
[02:35:01] Kookie is great when you want her but
[02:35:04] you don't want to add cookie in like a
[02:35:05] freeze team I mean you can like
[02:35:07] electrocharged and
[02:35:09] then maybe not cookie maybe like Toma
[02:35:12] like but Tom's not
[02:35:15] that
[02:35:17] I don't
[02:35:17] [Music]
[02:35:19] know there are leaves around is dendro
[02:35:23] pistachio to accomp them that is not cuz
[02:35:26] they're
[02:35:27] green how do we get here I'm sorry I'm
[02:35:30] sorry time to
[02:35:34] go
[02:35:35] with I think chocolate snapshots and
[02:35:38] vanilla doesn't cuz like a little drip
[02:35:40] of chocolate and like suddenly you take
[02:35:42] like banana and a smoothie I love
[02:35:43] bananas but if you add in a smoothie
[02:35:45] it's usually good but it overpowers
[02:35:47] whatever else and then your smoothie
[02:35:48] tastes like banana which is is a good
[02:35:49] thing but it's like you add it at the
[02:35:51] start then it snapshots no matter what
[02:35:53] else you add you're still going to taste
[02:35:54] the [ __ ] banana whereas like
[02:35:56] something else like even a raspberry
[02:35:57] it's like it might get like Blended away
[02:35:59] and then if you add up too much [ __ ] you
[02:36:00] won't really taste the raspberry anymore
[02:36:01] whereas banana like especially ripe
[02:36:03] bananas it's like it's going to snapshot
[02:36:05] into the drink
[02:36:08] itself into the
[02:36:12] wind and
[02:36:14] VOA
[02:36:20] so bananas are so great you can eat
[02:36:21] veggies easily have you ever thought of
[02:36:24] just not eating veggies true no no I'm
[02:36:26] sorry I'm sorry I'm not a
[02:36:28] dietitian no but like okay vegetables
[02:36:31] aren't even bad though just [ __ ] boil
[02:36:32] them or cook them I mean most raw
[02:36:35] vegetables are kind of ass I can't lie
[02:36:37] but if you cook them they're usually
[02:36:38] good other than like [ __ ] spinach or
[02:36:41] like
[02:36:42] salad how we explore the area ahead of
[02:36:45] us later
[02:36:49] I guess carrots are
[02:36:55] good just put sauce on the veggies okay
[02:36:58] that is the most American take I've ever
[02:36:59] heard listen no disrespect but if you're
[02:37:02] just coating your [ __ ] veggies and
[02:37:03] sauce there's no longer a purpose to
[02:37:05] eating veggies it just becomes just like
[02:37:08] you're eating Ranch it's just not it
[02:37:10] loses all of its benefits except like
[02:37:11] you get fiber and a few vitamins but at
[02:37:13] that point just take a [ __ ]
[02:37:14] supplement of [ __ ] vitamins and or
[02:37:25] Fiber what am I
[02:37:33] doing bro is always
[02:37:37] traveling I'm a
[02:37:43] traveler okay also I'm I I think the way
[02:37:46] that you worded that like disgusted me
[02:37:47] cuz you like put sauce on them it just
[02:37:50] it just made me think of like just
[02:37:52] dumping a bottle of ranch on it I'm
[02:37:54] pretty sure there's a better way to word
[02:37:56] that to make it sound more
[02:38:03] appetizing anyways thanks for watching

[02:39:35] like characters where it's like a good
[02:39:38] example is like sing troll where it's
