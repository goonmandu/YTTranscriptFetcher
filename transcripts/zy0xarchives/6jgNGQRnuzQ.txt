[00:26:05] like not what skin like like thin feels
[00:26:09] like I'm like I don't like not being at
[00:26:10] the bottom feels so weird but like oh
[00:26:13] maybe cuz it's smaller than usual wait
[00:26:14] let me make it bigger let me do this and
[00:26:17] then hilly chle was better anyways
[00:26:23] anyways look look at how relatable this
[00:26:25] is good night sleep well S4 by the way
[00:26:28] okay Black Swan sample like on S2 this
[00:26:32] is like actually worse than the freeo
[00:26:34] play option which is this okay okay Ron
[00:26:36] May memories of the past S4 arguably
[00:26:39] worse than meshing cogs but if you argue
[00:26:41] that fight me and then wo has on a well
[00:26:44] B Lon but it is what it is it is all it
[00:26:46] is it's [ __ ] B
[00:26:49] Lon uh
[00:26:51] however now to break the Mirage and not
[00:26:55] actually look free to play at all we're
[00:26:57] we're going to buy the weth lyone now I
[00:26:59] don't think I'm going to use it but I
[00:27:01] think it's nice to have just because I'm
[00:27:03] very low on The Hil Lyon and it would be
[00:27:05] good on like you know
[00:27:07] weth uh clarus could be good too I know
[00:27:10] the lon in general is pretty good but I
[00:27:12] already have two five star destruction
[00:27:14] ones I don't think I want another
[00:27:21] um not good on wealth it's a good stat
[00:27:23] stick in general like it's just good
[00:27:25] stats it's not bad it's just there's
[00:27:27] usually a better option but I don't have
[00:27:29] nil Lon the thing with nil characters is
[00:27:31] all of them want the [ __ ] tutorial
[00:27:33] Mission and you can only use it on one
[00:27:35] so I kind of need another lonee for
[00:27:36] someone else and I don't have literally
[00:27:38] anything
[00:27:40] else I have one good night and sleep
[00:27:42] well it's literally not even S5 and
[00:27:44] [ __ ] I'd rather ferment myself in a
[00:27:46] [ __ ] jug than use fada don't even
[00:27:48] mention that [ __ ] lone to me don't
[00:27:50] mention that lone to
[00:27:52] me
[00:27:56] anyways
[00:28:01] uh okay let's just uh let's let's get a
[00:28:03] go to [ __ ] peny before it's too late
[00:28:04] and I stall for 7even hours of
[00:28:11] stream yeah the new one's good it gives
[00:28:13] a
[00:28:16] but I don't
[00:28:18] know I kind of don't see the purpose in
[00:28:21] buying
[00:28:25] it the benefit of buying the the the fre
[00:28:28] like the memory of chaos one is that
[00:28:30] it's a freeo play lyone so even if it
[00:28:33] performs
[00:28:35] slightly I want to say worse but I guess
[00:28:38] sometimes
[00:28:39] better it's like more
[00:28:44] impressive I don't
[00:28:54] know bro sorry Escape okay this is one
[00:28:57] thing I don't get with star rail genin
[00:28:59] player take incoming muted LOL w why
[00:29:02] when I spam the Escape key look at how
[00:29:05] many [ __ ] escapes the needs
[00:29:09] look

[00:29:16] why but look you can literally you can

[00:29:23] look at no animation cancel you have to
[00:29:25] animation cancel leaving the game you
[00:29:27] literally have to animation cancel to oh
[00:29:29] I [ __ ] it up you lit have to why am I
[00:29:31] [ __ ] it up wait wait wait wait
[00:29:34] there's a faster way what's the fastest
[00:29:35] way oh yeah it's a step you do that and
[00:29:36] then you spam your step key you do that
[00:29:39] and you spam your yeah that's how you

[00:29:58] of clutch that was kind of

[00:30:20] while I'm doing something else I hear

[00:30:25] the okay this music's very l
[00:30:30] L get hit by car I already
[00:30:36] did okay we'll do our dieses
[00:30:41] later um
[00:30:44] okay wait let me put can I put blade in
[00:30:47] this team without
[00:30:55] griefing kind of can't
[00:30:58] I mean we could Ben Kafka
[00:31:02] but
[00:31:05] um I mean it's [ __ ] story we don't
[00:31:08] actually need to fight anything right so
[00:31:10] I don't think it matters let me put as
[00:31:13] Team
[00:31:14] Four also Dan hung like inor is really
[00:31:17] good for exploring cuz like could Talent
[00:31:19] then spam
[00:31:20] e wasn't that be
[00:31:23] Clueless Okay blade Black Swan okay hear
[00:31:26] me here my takeout he my full takeout
[00:31:29] before you take it out of context okay
[00:31:31] everyone ready everyone ready listen
[00:31:32] listen Pand than for 3 months but [ __ ]
[00:31:35] you sorry listen listen to my whole take
[00:31:37] Mr sock a good team for Dan okay you
[00:31:41] play Dan Hong you play a support and
[00:31:42] then another support that A Healer you
[00:31:44] could do like Ting Yun paila or like
[00:31:45] silverwolf or like [ __ ] Ron May or BR
[00:31:48] but with BR you have to uh usually you
[00:31:50] would basic attack with braia and then
[00:31:52] and then go no sorry uh basic ATT with
[00:31:54] emor L then your bronia goes right after
[00:31:56] and then you skill on your emor you
[00:31:57] could also run bro really fast so that
[00:31:58] she uh Basics and then goes after and
[00:32:00] then skills but anyways uh okay so uh uh
[00:32:04] listen here here my whole take out here
[00:32:05] my whole take out Black Swan right
[00:32:09] technically is like if you use her in a
[00:32:12] non-dot team she could just be a worse
[00:32:14] peila because she reduces defense of
[00:32:16] enemies by 20 plus% right and and
[00:32:21] debuffs if you're playing Dr ratio but
[00:32:22] in general like a worse paa right and
[00:32:25] pila's arguably top two characters in
[00:32:27] the game
[00:32:30] so this is not even
[00:32:35] bad okay not top two but like top like
[00:32:39] four p a not skill point positive
[00:32:42] actually still skill point positive so
[00:32:43] Pila never needs to use her skill but uh
[00:32:45] Black Swan would only need to use it
[00:32:47] once every three turns because this
[00:32:48] defense red lasts for three
[00:32:52] turns so still skill point
[00:32:56] positive
[00:33:01] anyways okay no more
[00:33:04] yapping are you ready okay so for those
[00:33:06] who don't know we will be continuing the
[00:33:09] quest starting from wherever the [ __ ] we

[00:43:48] good look is this lady the stow away
[00:43:51] we're looking for huh I remember this
[00:43:54] guy who's this
[00:43:57] his forearms kind of
[00:43:59] big I like his pants still think he he
[00:44:03] should shave personally but says know
[00:44:05] him look at his brown hair and gray
[00:44:09] vest he's the officer sent here by the
[00:44:12] family to maintain order at the Charmy
[00:44:17] Festival I see you're wrong I mean I
[00:44:20] think you should have a full ass beard

[00:44:24] beard or shave my take we're sure she's
[00:44:27] the one that's nonsense take another
[00:44:31] look will you the witness report says
[00:44:34] that the suspect is a lad with silver
[00:44:36] hair and you guys are going after a girl

[00:53:09] man who turned dreams wait wait wait I

[00:53:19] founder of the dream skip not a lur
[00:53:21] Skipper not a l Skipper turn dreams into
[00:53:24] reality
[00:53:25] there were different stories out there
[00:53:27] about the watchmaker's origin some said
[00:53:29] he was a traveling Merchant from Beyond
[00:53:31] the sky some claim that he was exiled to
[00:53:34] pentacon as a prisoner and some
[00:53:37] speculate that he wasn't even a real
[00:53:38] person just a symbol the true story is
[00:53:41] anyone's guess but everyone aspires to
[00:53:44] emulate his success and be the next
[00:53:46] watchmaker as his inspiring story became
[00:53:49] known across the cosmos those with a
[00:53:52] dream flocked to pentacon and droves

[00:58:34] pioneered the school of thought known as
[00:58:36] cism in which he promoted the conception
[00:58:39] of Soul glad as a new kind of lifestyle
[00:58:41] and just like that he created a

[01:46:23] other again so soon hey I'm this is like
[01:46:26] the fourth time we see each other some
[01:46:27] would say it's Destiny others would say
[01:46:29] it's fate hey uh I haven't had a chance
[01:46:32] to properly introduce myself all the
[01:46:34] commotion just now I heard a bunch of
[01:46:37] mass fools were causing a ruckus on the
[01:46:39] streets I happened to be passing through
[01:46:42] got stopped for questioning and there
[01:46:44] were some
[01:46:46] misunderstandings along the
[01:46:48] way anyway I owe you another one is this
[01:46:52] lady your friend too yeah I'm pretty
[01:46:55] popular well we've only met each other
[01:46:57] once before but she is a kind soul for
[01:47:00] helping me at the hotel it's my pleasure
[01:47:03] to beautiful lady okay I SK I I didn't
[01:47:06] mean to skip the beautiful lady part by
[01:47:09] the way what did you do to that man
[01:47:11] earlier it was like someone took him on
[01:47:13] an emotional roller coaster yeah avent's
[01:47:15] kind of yeah he's kind of insane I'm
[01:47:17] sorry it he's just like that I was
[01:47:18] wondering about that too
[01:47:21] what happened back there
[01:47:23] exactly oh never mind I thought she was
[01:47:25] asking about in the room okay never mind
[01:47:28] wait what oh about the [ __ ] the dude
[01:47:31] uh talk therapy I use that on him what
[01:47:33] are you talking about it wasn't talk
[01:47:35] therapy it was Clockwork I don't think
[01:47:39] it's that simple could it have something
[01:47:41] to do with that uh Clocky that only you
[01:47:43] can see Clocky yes that cartoon
[01:47:48] character I think he shown up in in
[01:47:50] reality I mean in the Dreamscape I don't
[01:47:54] really know how a cartoon character
[01:47:55] could show up around here but according
[01:47:58] to our friend here only honest people
[01:48:01] with childlike innocence can see
[01:48:04] him it seems like I'm too old to qualify
[01:48:08] for that if Clocky really exists that
[01:48:11] can explain a lot of
[01:48:13] things huh can you see me too I can feel
[01:48:17] the presence of something inexplicable
[01:48:20] next to you but it's a shame that I
[01:48:22] can't communicate with him like you can
[01:48:25] we can both perceive these extraordinary
[01:48:27] things in the dream probably due to our
[01:48:30] ability to react to
[01:48:31] Memoria you're more attuned to it than I
[01:48:34] am I thought your heightened perception
[01:48:36] was caused by something the elegant
[01:48:38] memoe keeper might have left in your
[01:48:40] mind now it seems to me there are many
[01:48:43] more special beings like her in this
[01:48:46] dream who is she shortly after we parted
[01:48:49] red again someone spying eyes on me I
[01:48:53] looked in the mirror and spotted A lady
[01:48:55] wearing a black veil we had a deep
[01:48:58] conversation but I won't bore you with
[01:49:00] the
[01:49:01] details it's a shame Veil her for her
[01:49:04] name I only know that she's from the
[01:49:07] garden of recollection Garden of
[01:49:11] recollection is that the group that
[01:49:12] serves the Eon of Rememberance exactly
[01:49:15] they Traverse freely between different
[01:49:17] worlds as mimetic entities and are only
[01:49:19] visible to certain people after all it
[01:49:22] is a Grand Event held by the family the
[01:49:25] guest list could be a lot longer than we

[02:29:06] breaking by Robin her songs are played
[02:29:09] in the Dreamland from time to time as
[02:29:11] the Charmy Festival is drawing
[02:29:15] close
[02:29:17] this spot is the closest place to the
[02:29:19] sky in the Dream
[02:29:20] escape it's far away from the hustle and
[02:29:24] bustle of the city and free from the
[02:29:26] bickering among the
[02:29:29] dreamers you can feel the
[02:29:32] moment the
[02:29:34] scenery the people and the
[02:29:37] dreams is someone singing without being
[02:29:40] disturbed by anyone this gives me honky
[02:29:42] Vibes is someone going to die is is she
[02:29:44] going to like tell me this is this is
[02:29:48] okay
[02:29:49] well how
[02:29:53] beautiful time I don't like this Frozen
[02:29:56] at this golden hour this Golden Dream
[02:30:00] shared by the fool from The Tavern and
[02:30:03] the memo keeper from the garden of
[02:30:05] recollection the wandering Ranger and
[02:30:08] the IPC Ambassador the astral Express
[02:30:13] nameless yo you want to go back to the
[02:30:15] ship I hear music right
[02:30:17] now last time I heard a song like this
[02:30:21] someone died please let's go back to the
[02:30:24] ship
[02:30:26] yo everyone falls asleep here
[02:30:30] equally regardless of our different
[02:30:41] agendas I'm
[02:30:44] sorry I really am still away
[02:30:46] [Music]
[02:30:48] I
[02:30:50] know I I never saw that
[02:30:54] coming I think it's only right to tell
[02:30:59] you yo Firefly the music's getting
[02:31:02] louder town was destroyed a long time
[02:31:08] ago it was probably the doing of the
[02:31:11] Legion or the Swarm
[02:31:13] [Music]
[02:31:15] but
[02:31:17] I'm an in
[02:31:20] Refugee just
[02:31:22] like many of the pentacon locals stop
[02:31:25] the music the harmony excepts
[02:31:27] everyone including Wanderers from
[02:31:31] afar the family takes them in but they
[02:31:35] don't they don't belong
[02:31:39] here yo why is this city racist in this
[02:31:42] Splendid Metropolis some have a dream
[02:31:45] called pentacon
[02:31:47] but some have
[02:31:52] dreams that are no different from
[02:31:55] reality
[02:31:57] okay even though everyone who comes here
[02:32:00] harbers the same motive in the
[02:32:04] beginning and it's likewise for
[02:32:06] me a wish I have a wish I want to
[02:32:09] achieve so badly in the real
[02:32:13] world but I can't
[02:32:17] was there a Five Star
[02:32:19] so I want to give it a shot
[02:32:23] here
[02:32:25] okay I know the feel what's your
[02:32:31] wish entropy law
[02:32:34] Syndrome have you heard of this term
[02:32:38] it's a strange
[02:32:40] condition those suffering from it will
[02:32:43] experience an irreversible chronic
[02:32:45] dissociation of their physical
[02:32:47] structure yo this means they will slowly
[02:32:51] fade
[02:32:52] away and the process is barely
[02:32:56] noticeable to
[02:32:57] others
[02:33:00] okay you can still run jump and talk as
[02:33:06] usual everything seems
[02:33:11] normal but then you'll start doing
[02:33:14] everything slightly slower
[02:33:16] than
[02:33:19] others
[02:33:20] [Music]
[02:33:22] uhoh and then even slower than
[02:33:26] that until the lines between your body
[02:33:31] and the entire world become
[02:33:34] blurry yo we can cure it it we we'll
[02:33:37] find a way able to tell reality from
[02:33:39] dreams
[02:33:40] because they have all been
[02:33:45] shattered
[02:33:49] [Music]
[02:33:51] so how could I possibly resist
[02:33:54] it I mean can you
[02:33:57] imagine I can actually free myself from
[02:34:00] this icy medical cabin in this
[02:34:04] dream I can forget about all the
[02:34:07] doctor's advice I can listen and see and
[02:34:11] touch and think and understand whatever
[02:34:14] I want with my body
[02:34:19] so although this world isn't
[02:34:23] real this
[02:34:26] experience is priceless D just like this
[02:34:37] moment are they going to kiss oh never
[02:34:40] mind for certain reasons there are
[02:34:42] things I can't reveal to you
[02:34:45] yet
[02:34:47] but there are also things you should
[02:34:51] know I am in fact after the watch
[02:34:54] Maker's
[02:34:56] Legacy but that doesn't mean we have to
[02:34:59] go our separate ways and be
[02:35:02] enemies but at
[02:35:04] least I really hope things don't turn
[02:35:07] out that
[02:35:10] way yo these are so
[02:35:13] toxic who are you
[02:35:16] I hope so
[02:35:18] too
[02:35:22] [Music]
[02:35:24] thanks in my
[02:35:26] dream I saw a scorched Earth the [ __ ]
[02:35:30] bird sapling emerging from
[02:35:34] it it bloomed against the morning
[02:35:37] sun and it whispered to
[02:35:40] [Music]
[02:35:43] me I still remember the question on the
[02:35:46] invitation
[02:35:49] letter why does life
[02:35:52] Slumber you see everything is possible
[02:35:56] in this land of
[02:35:58] dreams the nightmarish past will
[02:36:00] disperse and fade away like bubbles in
[02:36:03] water and the future that you don't want
[02:36:05] to face will never
[02:36:07] come why do people choose to
[02:36:11] sleep I
[02:36:13] think it's because there are afraid to
[02:36:16] wake up from the
[02:36:19] dream I'm sorry things are getting all
[02:36:23] Bleak and
[02:36:24] serious yo let me see what I can do to
[02:36:27] lighten the mood I mean don't you have a
[02:36:31] lot of friends on the astral
[02:36:32] [Music]

[02:41:44] story when counting the happenings on
[02:41:46] urell 6 it's surprising what Tales they
[02:41:50] spin oh well it was my problem for
[02:41:53] trusting
[02:41:54] him I'm really really disappointed in

[02:44:24] less
[02:44:25] reality I'm never wrong about the
[02:44:27] distinctive sense of Memoria that's in
[02:44:28] the air but this is very different from
[02:44:32] the sweet dream that I'm familiar
[02:44:35] with
[02:44:37] suffocating
[02:44:38] silent
[02:44:40] uneasy and these floating words can you

[03:18:20] Dreamscape Firefly did you make it out
[03:18:24] you're quite concerned about that young
[03:18:26] lady that's fair she was hellbent on
[03:18:30] assuring your safety even at the brink
[03:18:32] of death started to tog a little at my
[03:18:35] heartstrings
[03:18:37] even I know you've many questions so
[03:18:40] please compose yourself
[03:18:42] before that you should let your friends
[03:18:44] know you're
[03:18:47] safe how considerate Black
[03:18:52] Swan who the [ __ ] got me
[03:18:55] flowers it's [ __ ] adventurine isn't
[03:19:01] it a
[03:19:05] suspicious could it really just be a
[03:19:08] coincidence I've got a funny feeling
[03:19:10] about that lady
[03:19:13] but she did find and save her too the
[03:19:16] least we could do is listen to the other
[03:19:18] party's
[03:19:20] request that memo keeper obviously came
[03:19:23] here with an agenda we should remain
[03:19:28] Vigilant look Miss himo I brought the
[03:19:31] kid back as promised you're all right we
[03:19:35] couldn't find you in either dream or
[03:19:37] reality we were worried sick it's good
[03:19:41] to see your unharmed armed allow me to
[03:19:44] introduce you to miss Black Swan memoe
[03:19:47] Keeper of the garden of
[03:19:49] recollection you know each other yeah
[03:19:52] Miss heo said that they were
[03:19:54] investigating the incidents happening in
[03:19:56] the
[03:19:57] Dreamscape we've only met once but
[03:20:00] thanks to you we might be able to use
[03:20:02] this opportunity to get your camera a
[03:20:05] little bit
[03:20:06] better so how did you end up actually no
[03:20:09] no horny what the library what you
[03:20:12] so the one who attacked you was a girl
[03:20:15] dressed in red AEP Deb ucer arts and was
[03:20:20] able to shape shift her name is Sparkle
[03:20:24] a masked fool who has infiltrated
[03:20:27] penacon don't worry she won't be
[03:20:30] bothering you for now she's probably
[03:20:32] patting herself on the back for a job
[03:20:34] well done it seems you know her well of
[03:20:39] course I know everyone here
[03:20:42] on pentacon anyone could be lying but
[03:20:45] the remembrance does not
[03:20:48] lie so I feel the need to clarify with
[03:20:51] everyone Miss Sparkle's tricks can
[03:20:54] induce
[03:20:55] hallucinations but that strange
[03:20:57] Dreamscape nothing to do with her it
[03:21:00] originated from penacon itself
[03:21:05] panone itself have you not sensed it yet
[03:21:09] this apparent land of dreams it's a
[03:21:12] carefully designed dream maintained by
[03:21:15] the family through unknown
[03:21:17] means and the memory Zone she fell into
[03:21:21] that's the true Dreamscape chaotic
[03:21:24] dangerous memory Zone meme a beast of
[03:21:28] memory dwells in the ever shifting
[03:21:32] Labyrinth she's right everyone do you
[03:21:36] all still remember your surroundings
[03:21:38] during your entry into the
[03:21:40] Dreamscape
[03:21:42] [ __ ] fish the deep sea huh so everyone
[03:21:47] saw the same
[03:21:49] thing I
[03:21:51] remember it was a
[03:21:53] room and then through a mirror the
[03:21:58] gallery of thoughts that's how the hotel
[03:22:01] staff referred to it have you
[03:22:04] noticed these Landscapes seem quite
[03:22:07] distinct from that of penacon in your
[03:22:09] dream yet strikingly sound
[03:22:13] mycap Miss Black
[03:22:16] Swan you're
[03:22:18] right I didn't give it much thought at
[03:22:20] first but in hindsight the overlap is
[03:22:23] hard to
[03:22:25] ignore also after speaking to some of
[03:22:28] the frequenters the first stop when you
[03:22:31] enter the dream is supposed to be the
[03:22:32] hotel in the dream but due to certain
[03:22:36] incidents the hotel is now under
[03:22:39] renovation what could possibly happen
[03:22:41] have to happen to an entire building for
[03:22:44] it to require renovation that's a little
[03:22:46] sus that with what she just experienced
[03:22:49] and the answer is
[03:22:50] clear penton's dream is sinking right
[03:22:54] now turning back to its original form
[03:22:57] and falling into the deep
[03:23:00] sea sinking you mean the Dreamscape is
[03:23:05] collapsing the encounter at the
[03:23:07] Dreamscape damn her eyes are literally
[03:23:08] like a [ __ ]
[03:23:09] Galaxy lit a [ __ ] color gradient that
[03:23:13] would explain the uneasiness we've
[03:23:15] sensed from the family leaving aside the
[03:23:17] question of guest safety were this to
[03:23:20] become public it would it would tarnish
[03:23:23] the name of the planet of
[03:23:25] festivities with the Charmy Festival
[03:23:28] around the corner it's no wonder they'd
[03:23:31] want to keep it under wraps even the
[03:23:33] guest safety cannot be assured Now isn't
[03:23:36] the monster that she encountered
[03:23:38] indisputable proof need I remind you
[03:23:41] that it is a memory Zone
[03:23:43] meme How could a meme that Harold's
[03:23:46] death and murder appear in a family
[03:23:49] proclaims to be absolutely safe everyone
[03:23:54] could be lying on penacon does that
[03:23:57] include the family as
[03:23:59] well Miss Black Swan we fully understand
[03:24:02] our current predicament now going back
[03:24:05] to your original
[03:24:07] suggestion for what reason has the
[03:24:09] garden of recollection chosen to work
[03:24:11] with the Asal
[03:24:13] Express H let me rephrase then this is
[03:24:17] my personal request not the garden of
[03:24:22] Recollections and the answer is simple
[03:24:25] Miss himo I simply wish to make an
[03:24:29] exchange related to the
[03:24:32] remembrance apart from my duty I also
[03:24:36] have
[03:24:37] some Pursuit and
[03:24:40] Aesthetics I am I am a memo keeper and a
[03:24:45] collector I too yearn to experience
[03:24:48] those luminous dazzling Cherished
[03:24:51] Memories that's simple enough to
[03:24:54] understand no as for you all nameless of
[03:24:58] the astral Express and practitioners of
[03:25:01] the
[03:25:03] trailblaze I have faith in your
[03:25:05] potential as well as in the unique
[03:25:08] Splendor you will unleash on the stage
[03:25:12] this is why I wish to befriend all of
[03:25:18] you a place where nightmares and sweet
[03:25:21] dreams
[03:25:23] intersect the perfect cradle for the
[03:25:29] remembrance I understand but before
[03:25:32] replying we must first discuss this
[03:25:34] among
[03:25:35] ourselves naturally take your
[03:25:37] [Music]
[03:25:40] time
[03:25:43] Chad if I click on her hand does it make
[03:25:45] us hold hands hey heo how do you see
[03:25:48] things himo it's best to be skeptical of
[03:25:50] her there's a significant amount of
[03:25:53] intentional misdirection in her words
[03:25:56] but I worry about the worst outcome if
[03:25:59] the Dreamscapes anomaly really exists
[03:26:02] and it isn't a natural
[03:26:03] occurrence but instigated by someone
[03:26:06] behind the scenes then it likely has
[03:26:09] something to do with the watchmakers in
[03:26:12] fight huh how'd you figure that one out
[03:26:15] well excluding any extreme scenarios The
[03:26:19] Mastermind responsible for these shifts
[03:26:22] in the Dreamscape undeniably stands
[03:26:24] against the family whichs it down to two
[03:26:27] possibilities someone is drawing in
[03:26:29] external influences to distract and
[03:26:32] disrupt the family's control over
[03:26:34] pentacon either that or the family has
[03:26:38] been forced to seek outside Aid
[03:26:40] surreptitiously for self preservation
[03:26:42] okay but from the encrypted message on
[03:26:45] the invite and the family's reaction the
[03:26:48] former is more likely which also means
[03:26:52] that the one who sent out the encrypted
[03:26:54] nameless message and The Mastermind
[03:26:56] behind the anomaly are on the same side
[03:27:00] maybe even the same
[03:27:03] person well this doesn't necessarily
[03:27:06] mean a thing right in terms of methods
[03:27:09] both the fools and the Riddlers could
[03:27:11] pull off hasn't the IPC cracked the
[03:27:13] message
[03:27:14] too March calm down it's just a
[03:27:19] possibility but if this encrypted
[03:27:21] message isn't some harmless prank but
[03:27:25] dunzo to Trail Blaze Into The Fray we
[03:27:29] cannot remain
[03:27:31] uninvolved well let me tell you what I
[03:27:34] discovered and I'm sorry it's bad
[03:27:37] news according to reliable sources some
[03:27:40] people spot gotted a tall silver armored
[03:27:42] man on pentacon I've reached out to the
[03:27:45] blood hound family for news and visited
[03:27:47] many silvered claim to have seen this
[03:27:51] Invader and this didn't we see him on
[03:27:53] the couch earlier I've sent it to you
[03:27:56] open it look at the
[03:28:01] start holy [ __ ] we got both gamers in
[03:28:04] the [ __ ] Quest Sparkle and then
[03:28:06] silver
[03:28:07] wolf it's it's that hacker girl
[03:28:12] I'll get straight to the point I know
[03:28:14] you've been investigating the
[03:28:18] ab the music's louder weed to see that
[03:28:21] you've been doing that because the
[03:28:23] deeper you the closer you'll get to
[03:28:26] uncovering the truth about this soal
[03:28:29] beautiful dream the family is obviously
[03:28:33] hiding something
[03:28:35] right we've some valuable
[03:28:39] information of my heart I've decided to
[03:28:43] share it with all of you enter this
[03:28:47] string of code into your dream the
[03:28:50] device you used to dream with that's not
[03:28:52] my settings CU everyone else is loud
[03:28:53] listen to March when she talks also I
[03:28:56] take it you
[03:28:58] already
[03:29:01] [Music]
[03:29:04] Sam fight Sam straight think you'll get
[03:29:07] along with him just fine'll be overwhel
[03:29:11] by his
[03:29:13] enthusiasm oh he had me relay a message
[03:29:17] to
[03:29:18] you
[03:29:22] curtain said
[03:29:27] no I wish you luck don't fall behind
[03:29:34] nameless those stellon Hunters they even
[03:29:37] factored penacon into their plan nowhere
[03:29:40] safe from that
[03:29:42] the situation is clear the planet of
[03:29:45] festivities isn't what it seems on the
[03:29:47] surface everyone's sites including the
[03:29:50] factions in the family are set on the
[03:29:53] watch every party has I take that back
[03:29:57] and they're attempting to thwart each
[03:29:59] other okay while we still don't know
[03:30:01] what this Legacy entails it's only a
[03:30:04] matter of time before the power struggle
[03:30:05] and snares innocent bystanders okay the
[03:30:08] molten Knight Sam is reportedly a
[03:30:11] remnant of cloth's iron Cavalry a
[03:30:14] genetically engineered Warrior he
[03:30:16] possesses superhuman perception and acts
[03:30:19] decisively he'll leave no margin for
[03:30:22] error this individual is every bit as
[03:30:25] dangerous as Kafka and Blade the random
[03:30:28] kofun blade mentions we love to see it a
[03:30:31] threat the hidden map that silver wol
[03:30:33] mentioned is probably the sealed
[03:30:35] Dreamscape hotel for the sake of what's
[03:30:37] to come a visit seems necessary
[03:30:42] which is why I didn't suggest it
[03:30:43] initially but the way things are now the
[03:30:46] astral Express has a reason to join The
[03:30:48] Fray if the family asks just tell them
[03:30:51] that the express is investigating the
[03:30:53] stellon hunters I'm sure they'll
[03:30:56] understand we'll plan our next move
[03:30:58] according to how they react then we are
[03:31:00] in agreement let's return and inform
[03:31:03] Miss Black
[03:31:05] Swan o

[03:31:57] safety if needed I will also parlay with

[03:33:11] don't dude in this world there's no I
[03:33:13] could I listen better than a memo
[03:33:18] keeper like I feel like he'd be like a
[03:33:20] good friend to have like he's definitely
[03:33:22] like he has bad motives but once you get
[03:33:25] past that you'd be homies with him like
[03:33:27] you you first have to figure out what
[03:33:28] he's after and then once you figure that
[03:33:30] out you're cool with him just get on his
[03:33:32] good side and it's
[03:33:34] fine like I'm not saying he's a like a
[03:33:36] good guy like you know but I don't need

[03:33:40] need to find find out we're just
[03:33:44] homies thank you for saving me can you
[03:33:46] confirm Firefly is safe don't worry that

[03:33:54] that she refuses to wake up from the
[03:33:56] dream which isn't possible she must be
[03:33:59] hold up somewhere massaging her eyes

[03:52:05] a little
[03:52:08] time got

[03:52:45] there is a known semblance in the memory
[03:52:48] Zone mirroring the essence she
[03:52:52] radiates what reason does she have to
[03:52:54] delve so deep into the Dreamscape she is
[03:52:59] she
[03:53:00] running no running

[03:53:19] help you phase through the memory Zone
[03:53:21] uh yeah one sec I'm doing a
[03:53:23] puzzle I picked up slivers of her
[03:53:25] thoughts in the memory Zone these will
[03:53:28] help you form an impression of her
[03:53:30] LeBron's Legacy now you must hang on to

[03:58:30] hiding how to fight them mother [ __ ]
[03:58:33] they just killed our friend pain dictate
[03:58:35] your thoughts compose yourself and you
[03:58:37] will walk the right path once someone
[03:58:41] said to me no compassion for the enemy
[03:58:45] for that is cruelty upon
[03:58:48] yourself but you must See Clearly who
[03:58:51] the true enemy
[03:58:52] is and then with one swing of your
[03:58:56] blade you must understand its meaning
[03:59:00] and the price you
[03:59:01] pay this is the only advice I have for
[03:59:04] you from someone burdened with a blood
[03:59:07] debt

[04:00:08] Black Swan do you not intend to open
[04:00:10] some sort of
[04:00:13] teleporter I don't recommend that her
[04:00:17] mental state is unstable so we have to
[04:00:20] avoid any rough traversal methods like
[04:00:23] just
[04:00:24] now also while we're departing we can
[04:00:28] still do more for Miss Firefly can't
[04:00:32] we some remnants of her presence linger
[04:00:35] nearby seize the chance to Edge them
[04:00:38] into your remembrance holy [ __ ] fall
[04:00:41] Master if we can start investigating on
[04:00:43] the way that would be good let's go we
[04:00:47] have to find another path sorry but
[04:00:50] could you give me a few more minutes I
[04:00:53] um I have some unfinished
[04:00:59] business you watch AR as Aron turns away
[04:01:02] you remember that it was all that it was
[04:01:04] there
[04:01:06] that that it was there that she
[04:01:09] dissolved into a mere illusion you see
[04:01:10] her pause lips
[04:01:12] pursed eyes downcast after a moment she
[04:01:15] hunches down as if Gathering something
[04:01:17] with her hands and rises again May death
[04:01:21] be the end of your boundless
[04:01:23] dream guiding you back to the waking
[04:01:28] [Music]
[04:01:31] world let's
[04:01:33] [Music]

[04:01:39] okay all
[04:01:41] right I hate this game what is
[04:01:54] [Music]

[04:02:07] this
[04:02:31] okay oh no one's here what's going on
[04:02:35] why is it getting hot in the memorial
[04:02:41] these are all charred remains they're
[04:02:45] still smoldering the culprit can't have
[04:02:47] gotten far I suppose we can slow down
[04:02:50] for now
[04:02:52] then shut up
[04:02:54] S looks like this monster was slain by a
[04:02:57] thermic
[04:02:58] weapon
[04:03:03] okay looks like this monster died of a
[04:03:06] hyperthermic reaction
[04:03:18] something's off these traces are fresh
[04:03:22] someone just left the
[04:03:24] scene would this person have anything to
[04:03:26] do with what's happened just now I
[04:03:28] cannot reach a conclusion with so few
[04:03:31] Clues just listen to your gut you were
[04:03:34] the one who said that the remembrance
[04:03:37] doesn't work Lie from of these carcasses
[04:03:41] that person was tall and much stronger
[04:03:44] than an adult male the method was clean
[04:03:47] and crisp Sam no strike kills I mean it
[04:03:50] could be a monster too a mercenary or an
[04:03:53] assassin he entered through the door
[04:03:55] from the lobby and went farther into the
[04:03:58] hotel if that's the case he should have
[04:04:01] seen everything that happened here I
[04:04:03] take back what I said we have to hurry
[04:04:05] to that memory Zone where Miss Firefly's
[04:04:07] presence was was imprinted considering
[04:04:09] what this person can do if his goal is
[04:04:12] that place as well there won't be
[04:04:13] anything left there you two this way
[04:04:17] I'll try to create our music's already

[04:14:14] I'm down let me get this book
[04:14:19] first are you ready no no no there's a
[04:14:22] bird I saw the bird there's a little Le
[04:14:25] Firefly the bird it's what this room
[04:14:28] left behind the memories of
[04:14:31] her the slight trembling of I hate this
[04:14:34] they kill a character then they're like
[04:14:36] Wow Let's go through all the memories
[04:14:37] with her the flow of
[04:14:39] Memoria I gathered and reproduced them
[04:14:43] in
[04:14:44] fragments as for the
[04:14:46] context we'll need to sort that out a
[04:14:48] bit fine she's still fine she's not dead
[04:14:50] she's still fine she's still fine
[04:14:51] recreating memories on this scale takes
[04:14:53] quite a toll on
[04:14:56] me for that thing I encountered with my
[04:15:00] Trailblazer friend back then if I'm not
[04:15:03] wrong it has to do with the watch maker
[04:15:06] she mentioned
[04:15:08] your name thinking of you even in your
[04:15:11] absence seems like you two were pretty
[04:15:14] close bro we met we met like 5 hours ago
[04:15:16] she seems to be sharing her Discovery
[04:15:18] with someone and it's related to the
[04:15:21] watch maker I think okay I don't know if
[04:15:24] this is going to be like oh it was just
[04:15:25] a dream or if she's actually dead if
[04:15:27] she's actually dead I think they should
[04:15:28] have introduced her and then killed her
[04:15:30] off in like two two quests like I don't
[04:15:32] like I feel like if you're going to
[04:15:33] introduce a character and make us like
[04:15:34] them don't kill them off right away like
[04:15:37] let us like them more and then kill them
[04:15:39] off anyways she has no idea that she'll
[04:15:41] become a victim
[04:15:51] aware why did
[04:15:53] you this isn't what we agreed on wait
[04:15:57] who you yo yo who are you yelling
[04:15:59] atation has changed and it seems that
[04:16:02] companion has deviated from the original
[04:16:05] plan perhaps judging from the outcome
[04:16:09] this is that person's true hey who
[04:16:11] betrayed
[04:16:12] her I swear to God if it's one of the
[04:16:15] family [ __ ] who forced her to go that
[04:16:18] way Mecca what an intriguing
[04:16:22] statement I recall the blood hound
[04:16:25] family is pursuing a criminal a tall
[04:16:27] male
[04:16:30] is no but Sam wouldn't be in a [ __ ]
[04:16:32] dream with her the door it w open based
[04:16:37] on these fragmented pieces of
[04:16:39] information it seems Firefly's companion
[04:16:42] betrayed her like IAM valerant and
[04:16:44] trapped her alone in this room
[04:16:45] disappearing Without a Trace she
[04:16:48] mentioned that this transaction involves
[04:16:50] the watch maker and that often means
[04:16:52] stepping on many people's
[04:16:55] toes they might have had their eyes on
[04:16:57] the Legacy or wanted to silence another
[04:17:00] Who Knew Too Much or there could be a
[04:17:03] deeper secret tucked away in this memory
[04:17:05] Zone
[04:17:07] and to hook that elusive prize one needs
[04:17:10] the right bait so a master Baer
[04:17:14] me
[04:17:17] Firefly this is just the worst case
[04:17:21] scenario but think about it if the
[04:17:24] Mastermind behind all this is nearby why
[04:17:27] would he let us look around
[04:17:29] freely
[04:17:33] unless there's something else he cares
[04:17:35] more about and Mees or should I say is
[04:17:40] verifying she had no other way to leave
[04:17:43] but from the side
[04:17:49] Corridor the door it both open it's a
[04:17:54] dead end based on these fragmented
[04:17:56] pieces of information it seems Firefly's
[04:17:59] companion betrayed her halfway she
[04:18:02] mentioned that this transaction involves
[04:18:04] the and that often means stepping on
[04:18:07] many people's toes they might have had
[04:18:10] their eyes on the Legacy or wanted to
[04:18:12] silence another Who Knew Too Much or
[04:18:15] there could be a deeper secret tucked
[04:18:17] away in this memory
[04:18:19] Zone and to hook that elusive prize one
[04:18:23] needs the right
[04:18:24] bait do you
[04:18:27] mean
[04:18:29] Firefly this is just the worst something
[04:18:32] else he car we already T that literally
[04:18:35] was what we said earlier
[04:18:40] also we missed the last
[04:18:42] bird where
[04:18:49] the there's another bird over I guess I
[04:18:51] can't go back can
[04:19:00] [Music]
[04:19:03] I where was the bird there's a bird over
[04:19:05] here wasn't there I swear I came all the
[04:19:07] way back for a [ __ ] bird I'm going to
[04:19:08] find this [ __ ]
[04:19:12] bird you would not believe your
[04:19:15] eyes
[04:19:17] fireflies L up down
[04:19:19] Firefly stay calm she see
[04:19:23] yes what is making her so
[04:19:28] nervous let's get going
[04:19:33] let's if I can try again there it is
[04:19:37] she stares at the
[04:19:39] screens wait what all this in mind
[04:19:42] Firefly and her companion there should
[04:19:44] only be one have entered this Corridor
[04:19:47] together I backtracked for a bird and I
[04:19:49] got a cut
[04:19:54] scene that thing I encountered if I'm
[04:19:57] not wrong she thinking of she seem yeah
[04:20:01] we did that one
[04:20:05] before
[04:20:07] [ __ ] you bird why are there even Birds
[04:20:10] here man it's not the time we're serious
[04:20:13] right
[04:20:16] [Music]
[04:20:25] now there's actually a path here
[04:20:28] unpredictable Pathways pointing toward a
[04:20:30] Wandering meme she was I have the humor
[04:20:33] of a
[04:20:35] child
[04:20:48] okay it's an exit following this path
[04:20:52] should lead me out of the no the door's

[04:28:26] caught damn in short you need to thank
[04:28:29] this lady here my friend not only did
[04:28:32] she not betray you on the contrary
[04:28:36] she rescued
[04:28:41] you from that galaxy
[04:28:48] ranger
[04:28:50] right I do enjoy seeing that shot this
[04:28:53] guy talks like a [ __ ]
[04:28:54] sociopath my friend let's be honest that
[04:28:59] woman named
[04:29:01] acaron isn't as simple as you thought
[04:29:05] did she say she's a galaxy
[04:29:08] ranger she's actually an
[04:29:11] emanator who brings death and
[04:29:20] finality no way bro she literally could
[04:29:23] have saved Firefly by just
[04:29:34] jumping acuron did nothing wrong
[04:29:37] [ __ ] she could have literally
[04:29:38] jumped and caught her this is the
[04:29:41] truth let me give you some IPC Insider
[04:29:44] information my friend it's not like
[04:29:47] there okay look I know my says me my
[04:29:50] reaction time sucks but there was a big
[04:29:52] purple [ __ ] forming then it appeared
[04:29:55] then it struck it's not like it was like
[04:29:56] a fast oh [ __ ] what where did Firefly it
[04:29:59] was literally like a whole process we
[04:30:01] DOD main character dodged it and we're
[04:30:03] slow as [ __ ] we dodged it we're on P of
[04:30:06] preservation we press e we taunt all
[04:30:09] right all good let me give you some
[04:30:10] insided information do you know Duke
[04:30:11] Inferno I do I fought him before did
[04:30:15] I nicely done as
[04:30:19] expected I'll cut to the chase
[04:30:23] then this Duke Inferno is a fire demon
[04:30:26] from fetor he's an energy life form and
[04:30:30] it's rumored that his birth is related
[04:30:32] to a certain
[04:30:34] genius
[04:30:36] he and his thugs formed everflame
[04:30:40] mansion and viewed nuk as their
[04:30:44] savior in actuality they were led by
[04:30:47] this CH does look like me burning
[04:30:50] and practicing the will of didn't do do
[04:30:53] ratio Quest no I didn't and even the
[04:30:55] other Annihilation gangs weren't
[04:30:57] spared I'm not sure what the family was
[04:31:00] thinking or perhaps someone was scheming
[04:31:03] behind the
[04:31:04] scenes
[04:31:06] but shockingly these characters received
[04:31:09] an
[04:31:10] invitation and why would the everflame
[04:31:13] Mansion
[04:31:15] decline they Harbor Fierce intentions
[04:31:19] swearing to turn the planet of
[04:31:21] festivities into a sea of Blazing
[04:31:27] Flames but there's no need to
[04:31:30] worry they won't be able to attend do
[04:31:33] you know why
[04:31:38] because iFit is
[04:31:42] dead what
[04:31:46] happened they were eliminated on their
[04:31:49] way the asent demonstrating remarkable
[04:31:52] exp minus one character ended iFit and
[04:31:56] swiped the invitation that the
[04:31:58] annihilation gang had in their
[04:32:00] possession the everflame Mansion
[04:32:03] disbanded each going
[04:32:10] okay their separate
[04:32:13] ways thereafter a mysterious galaxy
[04:32:16] ranger arrived on penacon checking into
[04:32:20] the hotel with only amus I mean yeah he
[04:32:22] could be lying but do you still need me
[04:32:25] to continue the story my
[04:32:30] friend it was acon doesn't Ru out to
[04:32:32] others do you have any other
[04:32:34] evidence
[04:32:36] the Galaxy Rangers come and go like
[04:32:38] shadows and there's little communication
[04:32:40] between
[04:32:41] them her story is almost too
[04:32:45] perfect she remains silent there's no
[04:32:48] concrete evidence against her while the
[04:32:52] IPC can investigate it'll take some
[04:32:56] time so my
[04:32:59] friend the choice is yours now you can
[04:33:03] leave this place immediately
[04:33:06] without looking back and forever forsake
[04:33:09] the chance to get closer to the truth I
[04:33:13] don't like the way you talk to me or you
[04:33:15] can accept my invitation and learn a
[04:33:18] truth a truth potent enough to upend
[04:33:21] everything in
[04:33:23] pentacon I need your help so I'll wait
[04:33:27] but not for
[04:33:29] long once you are ready Follow Me Wait
[04:33:33] does the choice actually matter here see
[04:33:35] the truth first then
[04:33:37] decide you'll still have
[04:33:40] time acaron is the emanator of a
[04:33:43] particular Eon but he gave me a
[04:33:46] choice maybe I should talk to Black Swan
[04:33:53] again this ain't balder's gate L
[04:33:59] bro my my you look like a small injured
[04:34:03] animal are you still with willing to
[04:34:05] talk to me of course I'm still willing
[04:34:09] to be your
[04:34:15] psychotherapist I admit I made a
[04:34:17] transaction with that gentleman to bring
[04:34:19] you before him he needs you it's
[04:34:22] essential if we want to reclaim penacon
[04:34:25] recognizing his immense potential and
[04:34:27] the invaluable memories he can help me
[04:34:29] gather I opted to join forces with
[04:34:33] him in
[04:34:36] everyone may be lying and yes I don't
[04:34:39] like a venturine guy talks like a
[04:34:40] sociopath with an addiction to winning
[04:34:42] yeah that's entirely true entirely
[04:34:44] however he is
[04:34:47] pretty do you still remember I said I
[04:34:51] have faith in your potential and that's
[04:34:54] not a lie The Garden of recollection
[04:34:57] wants to witness the future of the
[04:34:59] astral Express trailblazing the cosmos
[04:35:03] and as for these memories I will
[04:35:05] treasure them I do not have reasons to
[04:35:08] hurt any of you instead I will continue
[04:35:12] how often did they get away with being
[04:35:13] pretty [ __ ] the first thing we
[04:35:15] saw about Ron May is her literally
[04:35:18] drugging us and everyone was still sing
[04:35:21] Look I still love her do what you want
[04:35:23] CFA you can commit crimes it's fine but
[04:35:26] I'm just saying you can't be like oh oh
[04:35:28] pretty PR it is what it
[04:35:31] is pretty privilege is a thing
[04:35:36] can you TR can I trust adventurine my
[04:35:38] take on this might surprise you oh black
[04:35:41] Swan's take in my view he's a
[04:35:43] trustworthy individual not for any other
[04:35:46] reason but because he's an exceptional
[04:35:49] businessman in this vast Universe no one
[04:35:52] values honesty and contracts contract
[04:35:54] Jeong
[04:35:56] Lee but always be guard particularly
[04:36:00] when making agreements with him
[04:36:03] scrutinize the details
[04:36:06] beyond the confines of the contract your
[04:36:09] rights are off his radar he'll go to
[04:36:12] extreme lengths to ensure his
[04:36:16] Advantage who do you think's The
[04:36:17] Mastermind I still believe that Miss
[04:36:19] Firefly situation is deeply connected
[04:36:22] with the stellon hunter just as we
[04:36:25] speculated but as you've heard
[04:36:27] aventurine has his finger point Ryden
[04:36:29] would never betray me I can't fathom why
[04:36:32] he draw that conclusion but given his
[04:36:34] access to the the ipc's intelligence
[04:36:36] Network we should seriously she's going
[04:36:38] to be like oh my god look this is going
[04:36:39] to be okay this is going to be like the
[04:36:40] big plot twist she's like oh my God I
[04:36:42] had no choice I had to deliver death
[04:36:45] onto him it was my duty and then we're
[04:36:47] be like oh I forgive you and then there
[04:36:48] be red text Abba under score it was
[04:36:52] unexpected ear
[04:36:56] encounter that's why during this golden
[04:37:00] Suare it's
[04:37:04] but
[04:37:06] what is this dude tell me that tell me
[04:37:09] this is the best

[04:37:24] confused and
[04:37:27] sad whoever that girl might have been

[04:55:39] the M Zone asking you to
[04:55:41] stay for to Ralia youur to the
[04:55:43] companions after a thorough discussion
[04:55:45] the crew decides to assist pentony

[04:57:00] [Music]
[04:57:02] second
[04:57:05] okay you could go back oh okay then I
[04:57:08] guess it would have made sense to do it
[04:57:10] and then go back
[04:57:12] [Music]
[04:57:23] but it closes your game it's a joke
[04:57:30] ending wait is this
[04:57:32] bait
[04:57:34] I I guess it's not hard
[04:57:40] [Music]
[04:57:42] to I
[04:57:45] [Music]
[04:57:54] know yeah it's probably just the Easter
[04:57:56] egg you do it you're like oh you [ __ ]
[04:57:57] up and then you
[04:58:02] reset it deletes your
[04:58:06] account what did you rate the story I
[04:58:09] think it was really good I mean I'm
[04:58:10] curious to see how they follow up on it
[04:58:12] right but I liked it a
[04:58:15] lot I mean it was uh recency bias I know
[04:58:19] but it was definitely my favorite one so
[04:58:21] [Music]
[04:58:23] far left us on a huge Cliffhanger yeah
[04:58:25] [ __ ] them for that oops I have
[04:58:27] background mus nice but I really liked
[04:58:30] it the first planet wasn't bad too uh
[04:58:35] jillo V was good
[04:58:38] but I like it so far but penin is also
[04:58:41] aesthetically my favorite like
[04:58:42] aesthetically the whole dream [ __ ] I
[04:58:44] think is cooler than I think is like
[04:58:47] seven times cooler than everything else
[04:58:48] but that's just the type of stuff I like
[04:58:50] so I'm already biased but I like
[04:58:55] [Music]
[04:59:02] it
[04:59:09] a little rushed yeah the only thing I
[04:59:11] think I don't know if Firefly is
[04:59:12] actually dead I assume she is cuz we're
[04:59:14] getting all this [ __ ] [ __ ] there's no
[04:59:15] way she comes back uh elici a moment
[04:59:18] sorry but I feel like if um if she act
[04:59:21] like be like assuming she
[04:59:24] is assuming she is I wish we like it's
[04:59:27] weird to like meet her and then have
[04:59:29] memories with her and then she dies like
[04:59:31] I feel like yeah I feel like it could
[04:59:32] have been spread out a little bit longer
[04:59:35] pacing wise what happened to Lisa no
[04:59:37] nothing she's cool she's just chilling
[04:59:40] but
[04:59:40] anyways yeah Fontan sumaru pagy I still
[04:59:44] like sumaru a lot I don't know if I like
[04:59:47] Fontan or sumaru better feel like
[04:59:48] everyone's going to say font 10 cuz it's
[04:59:49] more recent and I I don't even remember
[04:59:51] half the [ __ ] that happened sumaru cuz
[04:59:52] of the memory of a goldfish but I
[04:59:53] remember liking it a
[04:59:56] lot but Fontana is really
[05:00:01] good
[05:00:08] yeah super act two was insane I also I
[05:00:11] think kri bear was like my favorite or
[05:00:13] one of my favorite genin
[05:00:16] Quest
[05:00:18] [Music]
[05:00:22] anyways 99% Firefly ain't dead Sparkle
[05:00:24] was sus of her the whole time yeah I
[05:00:27] think but like okay here's the thing if
[05:00:29] she's not dead like okay if you're like
[05:00:31] okay Robin's Not Dead sure but like I
[05:00:34] feel like if Firefly is not dead why
[05:00:36] would they give us this whole thing cuz
[05:00:37] think about it let's say you play the
[05:00:39] game in a year right you're not going to
[05:00:40] have to wait for the next patch so you
[05:00:42] could do all of this and then you just
[05:00:45] keep going and she's
[05:00:46] back maybe like hope you know but I feel
[05:00:50] like it would be really
[05:00:58] jabate yeah maybe it's some like dream
[05:01:01] [ __ ] like Cole you know we cured
[05:01:08] her yeah that could be fair maybe she's
[05:01:12] like don't believe your eye you would
[05:01:14] not oh pentag is you would not believe
[05:01:17] your eyes and Fire Flies oh my God I

[05:04:34] what we might actually unbench or
[05:04:39] J this is Firefly's gift to
[05:04:44] us
[05:04:45] slowly thank you
[05:05:01] Firefly let me [ __ ] Thanos I guess
[05:05:04] but it's fine it's not
[05:05:09] bad I to make
[05:05:13] myy
[05:05:17] earth I mean it's still our best piece
[05:05:19] shut up [ __ ] you it's still our best
[05:05:21] piece don't talk to me it's fine it it's
[05:05:23] bad but it's it's it's
[05:05:26] fine I would like to make myself believe
[05:05:31] that planet Earth
[05:05:33] turns
[05:05:37] slowly
[05:05:52] Dum you purposely release your guide a
[05:05:54] bit later uh for genin okay so star I
[05:05:58] just got [ __ ] like that's on me if
[05:05:59] star was delayed that's on me next one
[05:06:01] will be faster but for genin usually I'm
[05:06:04] like a little bit after other people uh
[05:06:07] because it's
[05:06:09] hard to it my guys are just long like it
[05:06:13] is what it is I Y for so long so like if
[05:06:16] I'm releasing a 30 minute video like it
[05:06:19] it's it's very difficult to have all
[05:06:21] that information in one day right cuz
[05:06:23] like it's not like I can prep it that
[05:06:24] much in advance unless I'm literally
[05:06:25] like like I feel like it's like
[05:06:29] impossible to get that much information
[05:06:31] very early on
[05:06:33] so it's I have to yeah takes a while and
[05:06:37] also I personally don't like releasing
[05:06:39] videos I don't like releasing guide
[05:06:41] videos until other people get to play
[05:06:43] the character just to make sure there's
[05:06:45] nothing that I would forget because a
[05:06:46] lot of people have to make a follow-up
[05:06:47] video being like oh I forgot this cuz
[05:06:49] they want to get their video out in the
[05:06:50] first
[05:06:51] hour um and I stream as the characters
[05:06:54] out which is also a thing so it's it's
[05:06:56] it's a lot of stuff stand still I think
[05:06:58] the best thing to do as a YouTuber is
[05:07:00] you just release it and then after you
[05:07:01] make a followup but I like to do
[05:07:05] that
[05:07:10] asep away by the
[05:07:15] wind but
[05:07:17] yeah receive
[05:07:21] Divinity
[05:07:23] um what took the longest for Shen Yun
[05:07:25] though I I I feel like I wasn't that
[05:07:27] late for shenyun but I think it was only
[05:07:29] like one day after others it wasn't bad
[05:07:31] but I'm trying to see what took took the
[05:07:32] longest I think I had to test a lot of
[05:07:34] teams when she was
[05:07:36] out oh I was actually I think it was
[05:07:38] just the editing like I think the guide
[05:07:39] was recorded before I don't think I
[05:07:42] added anything did
[05:07:48] I the planet Earth turn to
[05:07:53] [Music]
[05:08:01] slowly oh wait there is something I
[05:08:03] changed oh yeah that's what took shenu
[05:08:08] longer [ __ ] I had to add a
[05:08:10] whole section being like I had to add a
[05:08:13] whole section being like well I think I
[05:08:15] did I add it I think I added it and then
[05:08:17] I removed it so I kept Rea exporting cuz
[05:08:19] [ __ ] I I like talk about her
[05:08:20] power level cuz I don't want people to
[05:08:22] think she was Niche but I also don't
[05:08:23] want people to think I was overhyping a
[05:08:25] character when people were mad I genin

[05:21:17] I got a dude I got a pyro goblet with
[05:21:19] double crit at level zero on M which is
[05:21:23] good for a lot of power carries it
[05:21:24] [ __ ] rolled Thanos look you would not
[05:21:28] believe your eyes you would not believe
[05:21:31] your eyes this it's not bad it's just
[05:21:34] the problem is a lot of mar CH
[05:21:35] characters don't want crit rate like
[05:21:37] Linny has crit Ascension and duuke and
[05:21:40] then even for the others like the ER is
[05:21:42] usually wasted but it's still a good
[05:21:45] piece um I also got a piece with double
[05:21:49] crit and it rolled like [ __ ] that rhymes

[05:22:10] really need crit rate cuz Shan Yun gives
[05:22:12] some if you're running Shan Yun serpent
[05:22:13] spine his best weapon gives some Mar CH
[05:22:15] gives some and then you might have if
[05:22:17] you have C6 you also get more so crit
[05:22:19] rate on your pieces is still it could be
[05:22:22] good but it's yeah that's the thing so

[05:35:39] or guess what I if I start watching
[05:35:41] something and you I disappear for a
[05:35:44] couple
[05:35:44] days then you're going to blame
[05:35:50] me watch two episodes a day if I watch
[05:35:54] two episodes of One Piece which has over
[05:35:57] a thousand a day that is three years
[05:36:02] that is three years of my life three
[05:36:05] years of my life watching two a
[05:36:09] day three
[05:36:11] years that's how much I spent that's
[05:36:13] more than what I spent a ver
[05:36:15] million can you leave I miss offline
[05:36:18] chat I'm not ending for
[05:36:21] chat
[05:36:27] to yeah but like I know I would like it
[05:36:29] like there's a lot of shows that I know
[05:36:30] I would like I just don't want to start
[05:36:32] yet like I know I'm going to watch it at
[05:36:34] some point in my life but now 3 years
[05:36:39] isn't even bad [ __ ] that's
[05:36:42] watching two every day that I can't even
[05:36:45] that
[05:36:48] every Ying until the heat death of the
[05:36:53] universe got to go fat day than for 6
[05:36:58] months
[05:37:13] I read people saying that verm is a DPS
[05:37:14] loss I mean not
[05:37:17] really it's only a DPS loss if you're
[05:37:20] not running a crit rate weapon and you
[05:37:21] don't roll a single uh crit rate roll
[05:37:24] basically that's when it's a DPS sa if
[05:37:26] your M has zero crit rate subs and
[05:37:29] you're not running a cre wait no or
[05:37:31] you're not running a cre weapon not and
[05:37:35] or but that's not
[05:37:39] really it is definitely a waste of resin
[05:37:42] though definitely a waste of
[05:37:53] resin definitely no reason anyone should
[05:37:55] enter that domain ever uh with that in
[05:37:58] mind
[05:38:05] you either die the hero or you live long
[05:38:08] enough to see yourself become the
[05:38:11] villain never meet your Heroes
[05:38:17] [Music]
[05:38:28] chat
[05:38:30] okay statistically speaking
[05:38:33] Chad statistically
[05:38:36] speaking vermilion's optimal for us
[05:38:39] because we want to do a strong Box video
[05:38:40] which means we need more bad pieces to
[05:38:42] throw into the strong box and this

[06:05:25] was just asking Miss Kuching about
[06:05:26] purchasing a kite a kite are you buying
[06:05:29] some Regional Specialties to bring back
[06:05:31] to
[06:05:33] Fontaine well yes
[06:05:37] and it seems you haven't heard yet the
[06:05:40] theme of this year's Lantern right is
[06:05:42] Kite wait why would you be afraid of me
[06:05:43] playing your main I play literally every
[06:05:45] character perfectly the only actual
[06:05:47] Mains I've seen mad at me are Yia Mains
[06:05:49] for playing her once without yunen and
[06:05:50] then they were like wow I saw him do an
[06:05:52] abyss clear with his 250 crit damage oia
[06:05:55] but because he didn't have yunen he made
[06:05:56] her look bad and now people think she's
[06:05:58] bad even though his 250 crit damage
[06:06:00] level eight talent build didn't clear in
[06:06:02] 5 seconds oh my God that's it every
[06:06:05] other character I've played perfectly
[06:06:07] the it Le to build TR do this is this a
[06:06:10] long quest
[06:06:11] iies of other nations after all it is
[06:06:15] said that the stones of Another Mountain
[06:06:17] may serve to better polish one's own
[06:06:19] Jade yeah remember my business meeting
[06:06:23] with but all I really did was use my
[06:06:25] network to introduce lady Wang to some
[06:06:27] interesting Soo wait I'm actually the
[06:06:29] soo
[06:06:31] goat
[06:06:32] Thee Well you how high and far a kite
[06:06:36] can fly depends as much on the weather
[06:06:38] conditions as on the skill of the person
[06:06:40] holding the string but as soon as
[06:06:42] there's no wind you can only flail about
[06:06:44] helplessly like a sweet flower M exactly
[06:06:48] Lea is now a nation ruled by humans
[06:06:50] after all plus the easier we can make it
[06:06:53] to right thought it was a novel idea it
[06:06:57] shouldn't cost much with Miss
[06:06:58] Charlotte's help does he have 142 crit
[06:07:00] rate then he doesn't to the price wait
[06:07:03] does he want it to be too much more
[06:07:05] expensive than a traditional
[06:07:08] kite toys no my side was geared I might
[06:07:12] have [ __ ] him over for kaching though
[06:07:13] cuz I was trying to get my kaching rank
[06:07:14] one well rank 50 to me think for a
[06:07:17] second about how remarkable it is that a
[06:07:20] flimsy paper kite attached to a string
[06:07:22] has the capacity to touch the
[06:07:24] sky it is this wa let me look for
[06:07:27] something of paper that also carries the
[06:07:29] weight of Leo's cultural Traditions
[06:07:32] there's an old poem that goes oite born
[06:07:35] of paper flying true in sound a lone
[06:07:38] traveler Wait f kaching okay no
[06:07:44] disrespect
[06:07:48] but for someone who's been farming for
[06:07:50] kaching since 1.0 and I just I literally
[06:07:53] only have her geared like by accident
[06:07:55] he's right here 6 I have random [ __ ] on
[06:07:58] her and she's 54 we're so close I could
[06:08:01] just put a real wait a second wait a
[06:08:03] second we could overtake this guy wait a
[06:08:06] second wait a
[06:08:10] second my roll value is literally higher
[06:08:13] my roll value is literally higher he
[06:08:15] just probably ner redistributed it I
[06:08:17] have attack percent and and useful
[06:08:20] stats my bad ranked
[06:08:24] genin in the past more drama to
[06:08:28] symbolize a feeling of longing yeah or
[06:08:30] evoke the peacefulness of idic rural
[06:08:33] scenery if the people of today can
[06:08:35] derive enjoyment from this activity they
[06:08:38] will not only be more likely to better
[06:08:40] appreciate the
[06:08:42] tradition but Al that's the king we know
[06:08:44] always thinking five steps ahead of
[06:08:46] anyone else well said Miss
[06:08:50] Kuching as as duality of kaching builds
[06:08:53] I'm never using that word again for
[06:08:55] example whenever a kite blew away people
[06:08:59] would say it was the adep ey that
[06:09:00] summoned the wind to take it away as an
[06:09:02] offering that way you can turn an
[06:09:05] unfortunate event into one what about
[06:09:09] something more fun do you know anything
[06:09:12] like that more
[06:09:15] fun let me think whoa I suppose we
[06:09:19] should first talk about how kites are
[06:09:21] made it's another one of our precious
[06:09:23] forms of traditional not listen Okay I'm
[06:09:25] going to be honest I do not give a [ __ ]
