[00:03:35] I'll have something I haven't tried yet
[00:03:36] boss

[00:03:49] I do have other matters to attend to
[00:03:53] [Music]
[00:03:58] hey pymon Traveler
[00:04:00] looks like the gods smile upon me after
[00:04:03] all
[00:04:04] and come now I wouldn't joke about
[00:04:06] wanting to see my what do you say come
[00:04:08] now
[00:04:09] if you say so we missed you too
[00:04:12] official business right
[00:04:18] The Tavern not at all the acting Grand
[00:04:21] Master positively terrifies me why would
[00:04:24] I ever do anything that might displease
[00:04:26] her
[00:04:28] the truth is I'm in sumeru to learn
[00:04:31] about the alcohol industry here so
[00:04:33] despite how it might look I'm actually a
[00:04:36] Jafar Tavern weekly business purposes
[00:04:38] business spices are famous the world
[00:04:41] over and it's long been rumored that
[00:04:44] this fine establishment was where a
[00:04:46] certain very popular spiced cocktail was
[00:04:49] invented okay that's why the knights
[00:04:51] sent me their foremost expert in
[00:04:53] alcoholic beverages to come and see if
[00:04:55] it is as good as the rumors say
[00:04:57] and
[00:04:59] so far so good
[00:05:01] I'm already in talks with some spice
[00:05:03] merchants in Port ormos about some
[00:05:06] potential collaboration
[00:05:07] yeah that does sound like a great
[00:05:09] business opportunity yeah let's not get
[00:05:12] ahead of ourselves whether this
[00:05:14] lucrative opportunity gets passed along
[00:05:16] to Don Winery or not
[00:05:18] depends on how nice I'm feeling
[00:05:25] I'm guessing you've been to sumeru
[00:05:27] before what makes you say that you can't
[00:05:29] assume we're all on your own so you
[00:05:30] might be quite familiar you must be
[00:05:31] quite familiar with this place sharp of
[00:05:33] you I wouldn't say I'm familiar though I
[00:05:36] just came here on the sly once when I
[00:05:38] was very young
[00:05:40] and
[00:05:42] [Music]
[00:05:43] do continue it looks like I'm [ __ ] I'm
[00:05:47] sorry do I have to tell when I said we
[00:05:50] could talk about the old times digging
[00:05:52] up my past wasn't exactly what I had in
[00:05:54] mind
[00:05:55] well all right since you're so
[00:05:57] interested like I said I was very young
[00:06:00] then well we got kyolor we had only just
[00:06:03] taken me in
[00:06:04] I overheard My adoptive father talk
[00:06:06] about sending a team of merchants to
[00:06:08] sumeru during a business meeting
[00:06:10] I'm sure you'll agree that everyone's
[00:06:13] curious about their roots on some level
[00:06:15] and my roots they're in conria
[00:06:18] which is said to have been located deep
[00:06:21] underground somewhere near sumeru okay
[00:06:24] and so I stowed Myself Away amidst the
[00:06:27] cargo and silently joined the merchant
[00:06:30] delegation on their trip to sumero
[00:06:33] it wasn't long before the merchant
[00:06:35] delegation received news that I'd gone
[00:06:36] missing
[00:06:37] their leader promptly found me and
[00:06:40] before I knew it My adoptive father was
[00:06:42] dragging me back home by the year okay
[00:06:44] it was a short-lived Adventure
[00:06:46] sorry I don't have a more thrilling
[00:06:48] story thrilling Tales speaking of
[00:06:51] Catarina how much do you know about it
[00:06:52] not much okay the only reason I knew
[00:06:55] that conria was near sumeru is because I
[00:06:57] happened to read that in a book when I
[00:06:59] was young oh what the [ __ ] why are you
[00:07:01] there less to do with Congress what the
[00:07:03] hell
[00:07:03] and so I started caucus as well
[00:07:06] I used to believe that I had inherited
[00:07:08] some sort of Duty from my father
[00:07:11] hey dance leave then I began to wonder
[00:07:14] maybe my father left me in the peaceful
[00:07:15] land of monstat for no other reason than
[00:07:18] simply to give me a happier life maybe
[00:07:20] my father happy life would be good to me
[00:07:22] of course even if it means being cut off
[00:07:25] from
[00:07:26] certain things
[00:07:28] this is obviously all speculation
[00:07:31] simply put I'm afraid that I'm not
[00:07:34] particularly in the know on this topic
[00:07:36] these days my surname almarik
[00:07:40] Roberts
[00:07:44] one day afternoon please boss
[00:07:48] the death afternoon
[00:07:51] 's face
[00:07:53] look close
[00:07:56] wait who says come a little closer
[00:07:57] that's Lisa that's Lisa he's being edgy
[00:08:00] at true
[00:08:02] I like his drip I can't wait yeah can't
[00:08:05] wait to get him in six years it's ten
[00:08:07] years when I'm married and have like a
[00:08:09] real job and then he comes out tell me
[00:08:12] what do you know about the significance
[00:08:14] of that name Albury
[00:08:21] ah you've decided to join us
[00:08:24] I was wondering how long you planned on
[00:08:26] listening in I believe I've seen you
[00:08:29] before in monstat
[00:08:31] danesliff if I'm not mistaken so you
[00:08:34] remember me
[00:08:35] then we are already acquainted okay
[00:08:39] descendant of the Abyss orders found her
[00:08:42] wait
[00:08:44] did we know this this is this new lore
[00:08:48] the [ __ ]
[00:08:50] wait
[00:08:55] wait
[00:08:57] descendant of the Abyss orders founder
[00:09:05] that's like big balls so like there's
[00:09:07] balls which is him and then there's like
[00:09:09] I'll just keep playing the quest
[00:09:14] I take it that you weren't aware of this
[00:09:16] until now Kaya or you wouldn't have been
[00:09:19] so forthcoming with your surname so why
[00:09:24] it's quite a lot of baggage for a
[00:09:25] surname isn't it
[00:09:27] though I must say it does confirm an old
[00:09:29] suspicion of mine
[00:09:31] I suppose that was why my father left me
[00:09:33] in monstad after all
[00:09:35] I'm surprised that you take me at my
[00:09:37] word without the faintest hint of
[00:09:39] skepticism you're danger I told me just
[00:09:42] happens to answer some questions I carry
[00:09:44] in my memories
[00:09:46] and in any case
[00:09:48] I recognize your eyes you're a pure
[00:09:50] blood conry and aren't you
[00:09:54] very clever
[00:09:56] forgive me for being direct but I
[00:09:59] sincerely hope this new knowledge
[00:10:00] doesn't change anything
[00:10:02] if you've already let go of your ties to
[00:10:05] the Past then keep it that way
[00:10:08] you're not involved with the abyss
[00:10:11] ordering what if Kai is an abyss Mage
[00:10:12] and he starts dancing in a crowd Shield
[00:10:14] appears hey hold on now this
[00:10:16] conversation has taken a rather sudden
[00:10:18] turn for the deadly serious
[00:10:20] and I'm afraid that as someone from
[00:10:22] monstat I'm not accustomed to this sort
[00:10:24] of atmosphere because you know his
[00:10:26] constellation gives him a shield
[00:10:28] do I strike you as the type who would be
[00:10:30] bound by that kind of thing bound relax
[00:10:32] I'll be just as delighted to hunt down
[00:10:35] the abyss order tomorrow as I have
[00:10:37] always been I trust you Kyle either way
[00:10:40] looks like we're out of time who the
[00:10:42] [ __ ] are they why are we zooming into
[00:10:43] that oh so I'll leave the three of you
[00:10:45] to carry on the conversation without me
[00:10:47] what is this Gap right here oh
[00:10:49] [Music]
[00:10:52] Kaya see you around
[00:10:54] and danesliff no need to listen in from
[00:10:57] the sidelines next time we meet
[00:10:59] let me buy you a drink
[00:11:01] okay
[00:11:03] okay
[00:11:04] tension I don't really trust him do ody
[00:11:07] Dane the fact is I still do not know him
[00:11:09] well it would be meaningless for me to
[00:11:11] jump to conclusions but can the person
[00:11:13] truly be unaffected by their ancestry
[00:11:17] so you said that an albarik founded
[00:11:19] their uh I almost said Abyss Abyss order
[00:11:22] I thought my sibling was the founder
[00:11:25] Kaya's dad
[00:11:27] grabbed Aether or the mean right was
[00:11:30] like you are mine now and then corrupted
[00:11:32] him and now it's Kaya's dad and Aether
[00:11:35] against us and Kaya and then in the end
[00:11:38] the final cut scene Kaya versus his dad
[00:11:40] they fight Danes leave by our side
[00:11:43] gikaya's dad kills Dane's Leaf the Kaya
[00:11:46] saves danger Avengers him kills his own
[00:11:49] father we save Aether by killing a big
[00:11:52] Abyss uh Herald and then in the final
[00:11:55] moments we think we just saved everyone
[00:11:57] the days over boom from the Shadows the
[00:12:00] void Reckless palad and legoff come out
[00:12:03] all along the Final Bosses of the last
[00:12:06] patch the masterminds behind it all all
[00:12:09] along
[00:12:12] well I suspect that they call your
[00:12:14] brother their prince precisely because
[00:12:16] there is a succession of sorts and then
[00:12:20] the Lou comes in red
[00:12:24] so what do you plan to do here in sumaru
[00:12:26] I mean to investigate the loom of fate
[00:12:30] do you remember that name oh Timmy's dad
[00:12:34] Timmy's dad and Kyle's dad right so
[00:12:39] nevermind let's just
[00:12:42] [Laughter]
[00:12:45] imagine they're the abyss founders
[00:12:49] yeah this already single plan we learned
[00:12:51] about that back in my side you've got a
[00:12:52] new lead
[00:12:53] not exactly
[00:12:55] my memories suffer from erosion
[00:12:57] but while I was recovering my health
[00:12:59] recently
[00:13:01] I suddenly remembered something I
[00:13:02] remember something brother
[00:13:04] he mentioned the loom of Fate back when
[00:13:06] we traveled am I supposed to know what
[00:13:08] the lumafate is oh God I don't I might
[00:13:11] have forgotten apparently so
[00:13:13] I was also quite surprised when these
[00:13:16] memories tallied up not yet okay I
[00:13:18] recall that we were traveling to sumeru
[00:13:20] when the matter was brought up
[00:13:24] correct
[00:13:25] correct at that time they must have been
[00:13:27] introduced in one way or another to this
[00:13:30] concept
[00:13:31] if I recall correctly we were somewhere
[00:13:34] in a video Forest then
[00:13:38] no
[00:13:40] now is not the time are you concerned
[00:13:42] about the US order no it's just oh I'm
[00:13:46] still waiting for my drink

[00:14:10] more profitable oh this guy he's a
[00:14:13] merchant I don't care what about this
[00:14:14] Harissa

[00:15:28] tavern for a drink

[00:16:13] badge
[00:16:24] hello danesleaf
[00:16:26] wait
[00:16:28] this place it's
[00:16:30] familiar my lips hurt
[00:16:33] [ __ ] that's good it's pretty normal
[00:16:35] yes the forest has barely changed from
[00:16:38] how I remember it
[00:16:40] there is very little human activity here
[00:16:42] after all
[00:16:43] let's search the area and see what we
[00:16:45] can find
[00:16:47] oh
[00:16:49] what's gonna happen this is where the
[00:16:51] people of kataria were living watch it's
[00:16:54] gonna be some like random lore about
[00:16:56] them dying no spoilers but I'm telling
[00:16:59] you
[00:17:00] why is it way so small it's a good
[00:17:03] question maybe nothing
[00:17:11] nothing it's an extinguished bonfire
[00:17:13] sauce or strangers perhaps looks like
[00:17:16] it's been ages since it was last lit and
[00:17:18] clearly they put it out carefully to
[00:17:20] prevent a forest fire too dude what is
[00:17:22] in there it's not water it would have
[00:17:24] evaporated it's literally just white
[00:17:25] liquid area
[00:17:27] all that's left is that building
[00:17:30] what
[00:17:33] unlikely there are no signs of life in
[00:17:35] this area we should be able to enter
[00:17:37] without incident
[00:17:40] if you say so well uh you're in the way
[00:17:45] then Dane
[00:17:47] oh that's it
[00:17:48] I was ready to listen enter the house
[00:17:53] of the house
[00:17:56] [Music]
[00:18:04] 10 stream title I was gonna change this
[00:18:09] smell it

[00:18:12] marks exclamation marks in here
[00:18:17] [Music]
[00:18:19] seems you're right Dane
[00:18:22] hey we got a medicine ball or this one

[00:18:27] why don't we open it uh and by we paima
[00:18:31] means you
[00:18:33] scared that whatever's inside might bite

[00:18:45] was this a makeup box oh someone's dead
[00:18:51] why do I feel like someone's dead
[00:18:53] [Music]
[00:18:54] was hoping we'd uncover some super big
[00:18:56] secret especially after Dane caught this
[00:19:00] uh oh
[00:19:03] something's about to happen I don't like
[00:19:05] this
[00:19:06] is just a bench surely a bench can't
[00:19:08] mean anything
[00:19:09] wait is it a bed I don't know
[00:19:15] oh
[00:19:21] doesn't look like there's anything else
[00:19:23] worth their attention here you sure we
[00:19:26] have the right place Dane my memories
[00:19:28] are quite foggy but my subconscious and
[00:19:31] instincts both assert that something
[00:19:33] once happened here
[00:19:34] but we'll exhaust ourselves if we search
[00:19:36] aimlessly
[00:19:38] yeah dude not climb on roasting this
[00:19:41] place where this is literally like a
[00:19:42] five thousand dollar apartment in New
[00:19:44] York it's literally
[00:19:46] just some minor adversaries
[00:19:50] go to La the Chicago's like [ __ ] 500
[00:19:53] 000 boom you get this
[00:19:55] pymon's like saying it's trash
[00:19:57] take it easy
[00:20:02] why are we killing slimes
[00:20:05] I'm a slime pacifist
[00:20:08] anyway
[00:20:15] Let's Just Dance
[00:20:47] I doubt that the appearance of those
[00:20:49] monsters was wholly random there must be
[00:20:51] something nearby holy oh like the whole
[00:20:55] like apps
[00:20:56] hmm
[00:20:58] but it seems to be more than that okay
[00:21:01] I'll go slightly further out to
[00:21:03] investigate any issues with the nearby
[00:21:05] Ley lines
[00:21:06] I might be a while you should wait for
[00:21:09] me here yeah we're not gonna wait for
[00:21:11] you
[00:21:12] your suspicions are as banal as they are
[00:21:15] the [ __ ] is I barely think that this
[00:21:18] house should remain the focus of our
[00:21:19] investigation and as such
[00:21:22] stay here and keep an eye on it not to
[00:21:25] mention that if even forest rangers are
[00:21:27] capable of investigating Ley lines I
[00:21:30] will be more than able to handle it
[00:21:32] alone okay
[00:21:33] fair enough
[00:21:35] yeah surely we won't get attacked while
[00:21:37] we're out here waiting
[00:21:39] there surely we'll just be making food
[00:21:40] with pymon surely nothing's gonna happen
[00:21:42] surely we're just gonna wait
[00:21:45] surely We're Not Gonna trigger a story
[00:21:47] changing cutscene here
[00:21:48] where's the bonfire
[00:21:52] I know something's about to happen
[00:21:54] don't like that that's
[00:22:04] Cup oh it is water wait what's happening
[00:22:09] there's no other reason the food alone
[00:22:10] would be in the changing the subject
[00:22:12] Pain's taking forever he said that there
[00:22:15] might be an issue with the nearby Ley
[00:22:17] lines how bad do you think it could be
[00:22:20] ah
[00:22:21] we came together but now it's back to
[00:22:24] just being the two of us again
[00:22:26] you know now that baima mentions it we
[00:22:30] really have spent lots and lots of time
[00:22:32] together haven't we

[00:23:02] came to save us and then was

[00:30:29] I'm from conria
[00:30:30] I'm just a traveler
[00:30:33] your clothes
[00:30:35] do you worship a god traveler I follow
[00:30:38] no God though I count some of them as my
[00:30:40] friends
[00:30:41] sounds like you've had an eventful life
[00:30:46] all right well
[00:30:48] my name is Ida and you are correct I was
[00:30:53] once conrion
[00:30:55] oh I apologize for my earlier hostility
[00:30:58] but you must understand it's as far as
[00:31:01] I'm concerned humans who do not worship
[00:31:04] the seven on I extinct
[00:31:07] and all who place faith in the gods are
[00:31:11] my enemies spoken like a true Connor Ian
[00:31:15] that may be
[00:31:17] but the fact is that chances to talk to
[00:31:20] people like yourself have been
[00:31:22] few and goodbye shall ask lover 101.
[00:31:25] thanks for being here
[00:31:29] curse of immortality
[00:31:35] I must curse
[00:31:37] laughs
[00:31:38] it was a little gift given to the people
[00:31:44] of conrey are by those
[00:31:47] vile gods
[00:31:49] we lost our home
[00:31:52] our loved ones everything
[00:31:56] the agony of
[00:31:58] the cataclysm itself was already too
[00:32:01] much to bear but then came the curse
[00:32:04] robbing us any chance of release
[00:32:08] all we can do is watch
[00:32:11] helplessly as our souls erode in our
[00:32:16] bodies
[00:32:17] okay well that's kind of such
[00:32:21] it's just like dancing Christmas
[00:32:22] mortality so why did some people turn
[00:32:24] into hilly trolls and then others are
[00:32:26] afflicted by this curse although konria
[00:32:29] began with a single bloodline it was
[00:32:33] a home to others too
[00:32:36] any who forsooks their gods and came to
[00:32:39] Conrail were welcomed as our fellow
[00:32:42] citizens
[00:32:43] when the cataclysm came
[00:32:45] we pure blood conorians were declared
[00:32:49] for greater sinners
[00:32:52] upon us the gods placed the curse
[00:32:57] immortality who the [ __ ] says
[00:33:00] whose ancestry belonged to the domains
[00:33:04] of other gods were punished with the
[00:33:06] curse of the Wilderness as they fled
[00:33:09] turning them into monsters yeah that's
[00:33:13] kind of [ __ ]
[00:33:16] so who is this hilly troll to you my son
[00:33:19] my brother my friend watching his Kari
[00:33:23] bear oh my well I knew it
[00:33:26] illegitimate son
[00:33:29] how times have changed
[00:33:33] say that out loud with no consequence
[00:33:35] now but
[00:33:38] it was once a matter of unspeakable
[00:33:40] shame
[00:33:42] I was a noble of conoria
[00:33:45] I resented the life that my family had
[00:33:48] arranged for me
[00:33:52] and then
[00:33:53] one day
[00:33:55] I met a beautiful woman amongst the
[00:33:58] people foreign
[00:34:05] it was love at first sight Anonymous 6
[00:34:07] or 20 gifted
[00:34:08] Kari bear faced great hardship from the
[00:34:12] very moment of his birth all due to my
[00:34:16] selfish desires and and I was never able
[00:34:21] to be there by his side for any of it
[00:34:24] after all that
[00:34:26] he turned into a hillystone right before
[00:34:29] my very eyes
[00:34:30] I always owed him much and now I
[00:34:34] at least I can finally be close to him
[00:34:39] she was
[00:34:42] we were separated
[00:34:44] um I do not wish to dwell on it I'm
[00:34:46] sorry
[00:34:47] it could be worse
[00:34:50] I suffer the pain of loss because I once
[00:34:54] had everything I could wish for
[00:34:59] and now
[00:35:01] now that I have lost almost everything
[00:35:05] the little that remained I see with new
[00:35:08] Clarity if nothing else
[00:35:11] at least I still have Cory bear
[00:35:15] oh
[00:35:17] yes
[00:35:19] we're still gonna go kill a bunch
[00:35:23] yeah but I do have other things I wish
[00:35:26] to do
[00:35:29] you me
[00:35:31] if you heard so inclined
[00:35:34] sorry I'm sorry bro I need the common
[00:35:36] chest
[00:35:42] I see everything
[00:35:45] I do it Nana
[00:35:49] let's go out
[00:35:57] over here
[00:36:01] a crafting bench I'm sure you're
[00:36:03] wondering why I brought Curry bear here
[00:36:05] to sumeru well
[00:36:07] it's because he needs a medicine that
[00:36:10] can only be made here
[00:36:12] one which will help him to recover his
[00:36:16] Clarity of mind
[00:36:18] huh
[00:36:25] when we're in the castle they said the
[00:36:26] queue could not hope to break the curse
[00:36:30] I am well aware of my powerlessness
[00:36:33] against the punishment of the Gods
[00:36:35] but it is said that this medicine is
[00:36:38] imbued with the power of sumero's God of
[00:36:42] wisdom and can awaken the Mind from a
[00:36:45] state of Deep stupa
[00:36:47] it has been used in the past to treat
[00:36:50] cases of mania
[00:36:53] I believe that it might just work where
[00:36:56] do you hear this read about it in a book
[00:37:00] imagine reading books library
[00:37:04] [Music]
[00:37:09] I mean since this medicine requires the
[00:37:12] power of the seven to work
[00:37:14] in my youth I I disliked the life of
[00:37:18] nobility and craved excitement
[00:37:22] is the voice so dramatic because he's
[00:37:24] got him saying he lost everyone he loves
[00:37:31] there's a reason it must have been
[00:37:32] banned true
[00:37:35] Choice do I have
[00:37:37] what exactly would you have me do huh
[00:37:42] the gods have already punished us
[00:37:46] what does one more sin matter now yeah
[00:37:49] this video is really good I understand
[00:37:51] never mind
[00:37:52] yeah
[00:37:54] as long as you understand
[00:37:57] I'm sorry
[00:37:59] he's having his Joker moment actually
[00:38:01] sometimes perhaps a consequence of
[00:38:04] having lived too long as it happens
[00:38:08] I am in dire need of some help to make
[00:38:10] this medicine my hands don't have the
[00:38:13] dexterity they once did
[00:38:15] I I feel her they may be decaying from
[00:38:19] within
[00:38:20] okay
[00:38:21] to start with his head take this
[00:38:23] ingredient all right what the [ __ ] is
[00:38:26] this that's what [ __ ] time already
[00:38:27] needs to ascend
[00:38:29] a mushroom also do you have any uh [ __ ]
[00:38:34] I don't I have like one Regional I'm
[00:38:36] sorry oh they're there never mind we're
[00:38:37] fine
[00:38:39] I picked some before yes wonderful oh in
[00:38:43] in that case we have everything we need
[00:38:46] this is the method for making the
[00:38:49] medicine you just need to I'll call him
[00:38:52] about the steps all right
[00:38:55] all right I got this i got this
[00:38:58] uh uh crafts
[00:39:01] the [ __ ] nameless taboo Medicine of the
[00:39:05] Royal Court
[00:39:10] crafting by Among Us
[00:39:14] let's do it
[00:39:20] [Music]
[00:39:24] is it done
[00:39:31] in all honesty I do not know what the
[00:39:34] end product is supposed to have a
[00:39:37] picture
[00:39:39] the moment has finally arrived it's time
[00:39:41] to give Kerry bird the medicine no no
[00:39:44] we need to perform one final step
[00:39:48] of a bad feeling about this I said
[00:39:51] before that this medicine relies on the
[00:39:54] power of the god of wisdom points
[00:39:58] what's up remember me must pay a visit
[00:40:01] to
[00:40:02] a two of the seven
[00:40:08] oh let's go we're not calling nahida
[00:40:12] uh oh probably should ask her but all
[00:40:14] good
[00:40:16] probably should ask nahida if this will
[00:40:17] work before we kill this dude's son but
[00:40:19] you know
[00:40:20] whatever
[00:40:28] look at this statue
[00:40:31] how can I bow before this thing
[00:40:36] will utter no prayer nor will I sing
[00:40:40] your praises
[00:40:43] and your kind destroyed my home
[00:40:47] right unfathomable
[00:40:49] suffering on my compatriots yet
[00:40:53] here I stand before you now he didn't do
[00:40:56] anything wrong
[00:40:57] he's just chilling more than fate itself
[00:41:00] already has that wasn't the heater's
[00:41:03] fault wisdom
[00:41:04] I seek not to disavow myself for the
[00:41:08] sinful it's just a radish my veins I
[00:41:11] wish only to beseech you
[00:41:14] to have pity
[00:41:17] upon her Young
[00:41:19] an unfortunate soul unfortunate
[00:41:23] Care Bear
[00:41:25] he was turned into a monster before he
[00:41:28] had the chance to witness anything

[01:07:53] how hard they can hit I've done it like
[01:07:54] two years ago not anymore but like you
[01:07:57] know you can explain the context sure
[01:07:59] but what is like a 10 second clip
[01:08:04] [Applause]
[01:08:04] [Music]
[01:08:06] I don't know
[01:08:08] I don't blame anyone I'm just saying I'm
[01:08:10] just saying don't like people can make
[01:08:12] whatever content they want it's all good
[01:08:13] but I'm just saying it's kind of weird
[01:08:15] kind of weird champ
[01:08:16] kinda kind of misleading
[01:08:32] minus one chest where's One Fury how do
[01:08:34] you guys how are you guys seeing chess
[01:08:37] that I'm not seeing
[01:08:40] oh
[01:08:42] barnshots soon my shorts will be on I'm
[01:08:45] definitely making YouTube shorts I don't
[01:08:46] know if I'll upload them to tick tock
[01:08:47] too maybe but I won't run it it'll just
[01:08:49] be one of my I don't know we'll see but
[01:08:51] definitely YouTube shirts because I
[01:08:52] think they're just good potential
[01:08:55] I'm literally already on there it's just
[01:08:57] not my channel that's all
[01:09:01] I don't mind the platform I just don't
[01:09:03] like the [ __ ] the the the the some of
[01:09:06] the content not all of it but like
[01:09:09] some of the clickbait stuff is kind of
[01:09:10] weird it's like some of the content
[01:09:12] there you wouldn't get away with on
[01:09:13] YouTube like if there's like yeah
[01:09:15] anyways it's just it's fine
[01:09:17] but no it's always good obviously like
[01:09:19] some of it's good but all right we're
[01:09:21] back to the quest back to the quest
[01:09:22] okay I think we made it to the end what
[01:09:24] is that thing
[01:09:28] remember chances are that's it's just
[01:09:30] like the defiled statue yeah I remember
[01:09:32] that I was literally thinking of that
[01:09:33] but I was like am I coping if I say it
[01:09:37] something to do with the Miss order and
[01:09:38] these worshiping hilly trolls remind me
[01:09:40] too much of the grand thief
[01:09:43] okay
[01:09:46] oh
[01:09:48] this place is bad news we've got to go
[01:09:52] oh dear
[01:09:54] you free who the [ __ ]
[01:09:57] what do you hear me alone
[01:09:59] before a power I should cut it
[01:10:03] yo who the [ __ ] is that
[01:10:06] oh dear creature
[01:10:12] for I'm no God
[01:10:14] I am but a sinner
[01:10:20] a sinner
[01:10:24] pure spotless I know your fate well
[01:10:31] you need no longer more vacuum
[01:10:33] assessment nor accept the countless lies
[01:10:38] is that you Kaya's dad
[01:10:44] rise Beyond The Fate The Stone upon you
[01:10:48] it's the boy mode
[01:10:53] of time
[01:11:01] who in the world are you what do these
[01:11:02] words mean
[01:11:04] the voice it's gone
[01:11:08] white this guy just got infused with
[01:11:11] Electro
[01:11:17] what just happened
[01:11:20] when I saw that thing my
[01:11:23] my heart was instantly at peace I I was
[01:11:27] overcome by a sense of oh
[01:11:30] Joy perhaps
[01:11:32] all right I feel good in fact I I feel
[01:11:38] better than I did before I came in here
[01:11:40] came
[01:11:43] someone's not right about this place we
[01:11:45] need to get out of here
[01:11:50] wait what the [ __ ] is that
[01:11:52] does it bait you in it makes you feel
[01:11:54] good and then you get baited and then it
[01:11:55] consumes you and then you turn into a
[01:11:56] hilly troll SI silly Turtle silly Turtle
[01:12:01] hilly Billy's
[01:12:04] silly hilly turtle
[01:12:07] thank goodness he's still okay
[01:12:11] I
[01:12:12] have a strange feeling that what just
[01:12:15] happened was meant to be for this to
[01:12:19] happen or right at the moment when I was
[01:12:22] dreading or worshiping at a statue of
[01:12:25] the seven
[01:12:26] it's as if fate was calling to me uh-oh
[01:12:30] you say that I bowed before that thing
[01:12:34] so perhaps it might be just as effective
[01:12:37] oh I have to try oh you said it yourself
[01:12:42] I oh no well I don't have a terrible
[01:12:45] feeling about this
[01:12:50] Curry bear
[01:12:52] [Music]
[01:12:58] [Music]
[01:13:02] Papa
[01:13:04] Cory bear

[01:13:29] of course
[01:13:33] [Laughter]
[01:13:38] and yes yes this is this is what this
[01:13:40] feeling is
[01:13:42] how do you feel Corey bear
[01:13:45] are you fully awake now
[01:13:48] yes
[01:13:50] it feels like I just woke up from a long
[01:13:53] long sleep
[01:13:55] I dreamed that I was hiding in a little
[01:13:58] room
[01:13:59] I didn't dare go out the whole time and
[01:14:02] I didn't want to either oh
[01:14:06] wait oh
[01:14:09] hey buddy
[01:14:14] how about that
[01:14:15] me
[01:14:17] Papa
[01:14:18] what's happened to me
[01:14:22] Don't Panic son it's just
[01:14:27] While You Were Sleeping we we went into
[01:14:29] a fairy tale world
[01:14:32] there's no more conry out here and no
[01:14:36] more home but but
[01:14:38] do you know what that means
[01:14:41] no more red sky
[01:14:43] or no more
[01:14:45] end of the world
[01:14:46] is this one plus one hilly troll Mouse
[01:14:49] no dude no no too soon too soon
[01:14:59] no no no no no no no of course not
[01:15:02] look Corey bear you you still have
[01:15:04] Mama's scarf on your arm
[01:15:07] that means she's watching over you
[01:15:10] protecting you so how could you be dead
[01:15:17] yes really you've all only just woken up
[01:15:22] and and this must all be very confusing
[01:15:24] for you just
[01:15:26] rest here for now what if his mom is
[01:15:29] Senora
[01:15:30] and that's why she's dead because it you
[01:15:33] have to promise me something
[01:15:35] never take off your mask understand
[01:15:40] whatever happens you mustn't take it off
[01:15:44] okay Papa what happens do they die is
[01:15:47] that why you get it when they're dead I
[01:15:49] don't know
[01:15:50] it's a dream
[01:15:53] since that day have I been so no glad as
[01:15:58] I am not insane I can't believe this is
[01:16:01] really happening
[01:16:07] I knew that placing my hope in the seven
[01:16:11] was a waste of time
[01:16:12] I I even worshiped at one of their
[01:16:15] statues like like a common
[01:16:17] Fool's lover maybe that was this guy's
[01:16:19] name he's lives forever he's gonna
[01:16:21] change his name I want something true
[01:16:22] always a murderer
[01:16:25] I was naive to think that the gods who
[01:16:27] conspired against us whatever
[01:16:30] offer Redemption
[01:16:33] but the God we saw in that cave Ralston
[01:16:37] died maybe these guys are awesome and he
[01:16:39] just dipped and pretended to die because
[01:16:40] he was tired of Senora because she's
[01:16:41] crazy nothing like literally after two
[01:16:43] year Warren board anyways I'll stop
[01:16:45] talking
[01:16:46] that wondrous power it was
[01:16:49] truly enchanting I
[01:16:53] yeah also this guy was like What if he
[01:16:56] was attracted to the cryo Herald instead
[01:16:58] he's like you know what I'm sorry Senora
[01:17:00] but
[01:17:00] this ad that he's a majestic being and
[01:17:03] then
[01:17:05] surely that must have been the reason I
[01:17:07] bowed down
[01:17:08] now then after one besieges a God and
[01:17:12] the god responds by answering their
[01:17:15] prayers should they uh
[01:17:16] um do something to show their devotion
[01:17:20] piety is hardly my area of expertise
[01:17:25] but surely I should honor the god that
[01:17:28] is not a God that was a sinner a sinner
[01:17:37] think about him how dare you utter such
[01:17:40] blasphemy
[01:17:42] you and I have both witnessed his divine
[01:17:45] power when has the seven worked a
[01:17:49] miracle like this before never he is a
[01:17:53] god mightier than they and yet you will
[01:17:56] call him a sinner oh Preposterous oh no
[01:18:00] matter
[01:18:01] believe what you will you cannot shake
[01:18:04] my face
[01:18:05] I am going to [ __ ] you I'm getting plus
[01:18:09] one hilly troll mask yeah have fun
[01:18:13] go ahead
[01:18:16] honestly I hope you become a healthy
[01:18:17] troll too and then I get plus two masks
[01:18:19] yeah
[01:18:27] I should probably save him though
[01:18:29] I'll probably save them I feel bad
[01:18:33] we'll probably save them
[01:18:34] wait is the sun just sleeping let's see
[01:18:38] oh [ __ ] he's just chilling [ __ ] we can't
[01:18:40] read his mind
[01:18:42] can we [ __ ] alive

[01:18:49] in the fairy tale world as well
[01:18:52] my name's Kari bear
[01:18:55] nice to meet you dude it's like [ __ ]
[01:18:57] dude why are these quests so sad it's
[01:18:59] like [ __ ] utility's Quest or there's
[01:19:01] like that robot thing that's like cool
[01:19:02] but sad because like his the maker yeah
[01:19:06] and then there's this why is there every
[01:19:08] time they introduce another NPC it's
[01:19:09] like the saddest backstory
[01:19:13] yeah carcata
[01:19:15] foreign
[01:19:16] Rises
[01:19:25] following me
[01:19:37] those are the easiest to write
[01:19:42] yo I'm sorry
[01:19:44] wait we didn't get meat okay whatever
[01:19:49] why don't we get me
[01:19:51] getting me
[01:20:13] laughs

[01:20:25] ow
[01:20:27] huh
[01:20:29] that's our music
[01:20:39] I almost lost the three slimes
[01:20:58] The Wind Rises
[01:21:09] it's actually surprising how we never
[01:21:11] have our bursts like she's like I mean I
[01:21:13] guess it's low ER but
[01:21:20] no
[01:21:21] impossible
[01:21:23] what happened
[01:21:26] the hilly turtle worshipers have
[01:21:28] disappeared too
[01:21:31] was it oh an illusion
[01:21:35] it's true yes it can't have been an
[01:21:38] illusion I still feel that
[01:21:41] awesome and wondrous power flowing
[01:21:45] through my mind in body it was neither
[01:21:48] illusion nor coincidence and certainly
[01:21:51] no dream
[01:21:53] it was a Wonder yes a Divine or wonder
[01:21:57] let's go Traveler
[01:21:59] there is a reason for its disappearance
[01:22:03] and I do believe that someday in the
[01:22:06] future
[01:22:07] you're turning into a zealot
[01:22:09] could he
[01:22:19] you take I I'd eat who seems to be in a
[01:22:22] trance back to the small house
[01:22:28] Zealot like a Pokemon I think it's like
[01:22:30] a Divine worshiper or something I
[01:22:31] remember the Zealot in Starcraft I used
[01:22:33] to play Starcraft and then they would
[01:22:35] like they'd have like they'd be like my
[01:22:37] life for ire and then Ira was like their
[01:22:39] God so I think it's like a god worshiper
[01:22:42] like that I don't know
[01:22:43] oh no no no no
[01:22:46] maybe someone else came by it was
[01:22:48] fanatic there you go
[01:22:51] no no it can't have been that there's
[01:22:54] there's no sign of a break-in and and no
[01:22:56] sign of anyone having been here
[01:23:00] oh
[01:23:04] this does not bode well what if he's oh
[01:23:07] [ __ ] I was in Co-op someone killed the
[01:23:09] hilly trolls from the mats I'm sorry I
[01:23:10] didn't turn on Co-op I'm sorry uh we'll
[01:23:13] find them we'll find them we'll find
[01:23:14] them I'm sorry I'm sorry if I'm sorry
[01:23:17] bro I'm sorry
[01:23:18] this isn't how we left it
[01:23:22] imagine piemon just killed them oh no
[01:23:25] did he
[01:23:29] oh he looked in the mirror
[01:23:32] yeah you looked in the mirror
[01:23:34] oh
[01:23:38] it's broken
[01:23:40] oh no
[01:23:44] oh yeah the beer was broken the whole
[01:23:46] time I must have taken his mask off
[01:23:49] and
[01:23:49] wait was it not for wait
[01:23:52] wait was it not broken as soon as he was
[01:23:56] told am I trolling it was broken oh
[01:24:02] uh oh what if this is like in our Dream
[01:24:04] time travel

[01:24:09] are gonna be like you've been asleep for
[01:24:10] six years and then beep and then we're

[01:24:27] guessing how is that that just means I

[01:30:19] all of them this guy's like the NPC
[01:30:21] version of the tourists
[01:30:22] I've been using a fake name
[01:30:25] entire time
[01:30:28] Ida is the name of a servant I once had
[01:30:32] my real name is clotor
[01:30:37] oh what is Kyle's dad
[01:30:41] yo bring him to Kaya call Kaya what the
[01:30:44] hell maybe not his dad maybe like a

[01:30:48] it's one of Kaya's
[01:30:53] wait so the dads the dude that like made
[01:30:55] the this order so this could be like uh
[01:30:57] uncle nephew niece brother
[01:31:01] ancestor you saw too didn't you
[01:31:05] unmistakable eh the power inside Corey
[01:31:09] bear and the power of the one you call
[01:31:10] us sinner
[01:31:13] it was one of the same
[01:31:16] oh you're positive no
[01:31:18] it's the power of the Abyss isn't it
[01:31:21] oh at long last I have seen it with my
[01:31:26] own eyes that is no business of yours a
[01:31:29] sinner
[01:31:30] yes
[01:31:31] salvation for a sinner can only come
[01:31:35] from a sinner
[01:31:37] Cora bear did not deserve his fate but
[01:31:39] now
[01:31:41] it's wonderful
[01:31:43] he will be able to weave his own destiny
[01:31:45] anew born into abject sorrow he
[01:31:50] shall now become
[01:31:52] the loom of fate
[01:31:59] oh yeah that's the thing I was like I
[01:32:01] don't know what it is you're about this
[01:32:02] being from the abyss but the abyss is
[01:32:04] Sinister and dangerous
[01:32:06] sinister
[01:32:08] dangerous oh I never imagined that you
[01:32:12] of all people would deny the abyss
[01:32:16] how ridiculous
[01:32:18] we once believed that you would bring
[01:32:21] new strength and hope to conoria
[01:32:24] us [ __ ] is happening
[01:32:27] worthy Abyss a wondrous mystery what the
[01:32:32] [ __ ] is happening imagination and
[01:32:34] comprehension
[01:32:35] and the one who controls the abyss can
[01:32:38] control everything
[01:32:40] we yearned for that future we looked to
[01:32:44] you to take us there but what did you
[01:32:48] bring us instead they think I would wear
[01:32:51] a prince okay that's what I was gonna
[01:32:53] say I was like does he think we're our
[01:32:54] brother which I guess he does
[01:32:57] that's just gonna say I guess we do look
[01:32:59] similar we have the same [ __ ] haircut
[01:33:02] there's a rat tail we have a
[01:33:04] low-key ponytail
[01:33:17] okay nevermind what the [ __ ]
[01:33:31] hey traveler traveler
[01:33:42] yo someone called Mahira someone someone
[01:33:44] ring her up someone ring nahida right
[01:33:46] now
[01:33:47] of course I knew this was gonna happen I
[01:33:49] [ __ ] knew it
[01:33:50] oh you've been sleeping for so long what
[01:33:52] happened yeah I [ __ ] [ __ ] you [ __ ]
[01:33:54] you pie mom [ __ ] you [ __ ]
[01:33:59] what happened while you were unconscious
[01:34:02] shut up Daisy why is your way so small
[01:34:04] check the Ley lines nearby it appears
[01:34:06] that the abyss tampered with them the
[01:34:08] way our dream was a whole questline
[01:34:10] information and memories flow within the
[01:34:12] Ley lines
[01:34:14] what did you witness
[01:34:16] the founder of the Abyss order Albrecht
[01:34:18] what happened to him oh wait he is the
[01:34:20] founder only Abyss order his faith in
[01:34:22] the abyss well he was many things
[01:34:27] no he just name dropped them
[01:34:31] I thought it was just an NBC no wonder
[01:34:33] his voice actor was lit
[01:34:38] but the curse of immortality continued
[01:34:41] to torment his body and mind
[01:34:43] and in the end neither his faith nor the
[01:34:46] abyss he worshiped could save him after
[01:34:49] a hundred years he lost his mind
[01:34:52] completely and was never seen again
[01:35:01] was just one perverse product of his use
[01:35:04] of Abyssal power during his life
[01:35:07] rather ultimately sided with him you
[01:35:09] could say that
[01:35:10] he wouldn't be the abyss orders Prince
[01:35:12] otherwise
[01:35:21] I was sorry to tell you
[01:35:27] so you saw his memories from centuries
[01:35:30] ago through your own eyes
[01:35:33] it all but that was centuries ago still
[01:35:36] as I'd suspected
[01:35:38] the notion of the Loom of Fate did
[01:35:40] indeed rear its head the hilly trolls
[01:35:42] yeah the Hilton is not kayak seems
[01:35:44] closest to the ancestor
[01:35:46] albariq's son Kari bear and what
[01:35:49] happened to him and yet your brother
[01:35:51] never breathed a word of this incident
[01:35:53] to me
[01:35:54] I wonder
[01:35:56] was that the moment that he decided to
[01:35:58] go down this path
[01:36:00] imagine the Haley chill just starts oh
[01:36:02] so soft and there's like an ice ring
[01:36:04] around them this Kaya bursts I said I
[01:36:07] could know what he thought about all
[01:36:08] this
[01:36:10] something is clear that's not a happy
[01:36:12] memory
[01:36:13] clearly this series of events sparked a
[01:36:16] long period of deep contemplation
[01:36:18] this I almost forgot the song I need to
[01:36:20] check where it all began no we already
[01:36:22] did the parametric Transformer Dory
[01:36:25] I need to know what lies buried in this
[01:36:26] field
[01:36:28] oh it's gonna be a hilly troll mask plus
[01:36:30] one
[01:36:31] plus one mask
[01:36:40] did you read bury them yet a male and
[01:36:44] female skeleton buried together
[01:36:47] interestingly the male skeleton appears
[01:36:50] to have been interred much longer yeah
[01:36:52] it's holding a silk scarf in its hand
[01:36:55] what does this mean
[01:36:57] and how did you know that there were
[01:36:59] bodies buried here
[01:37:04] what yeah it's probably the most unless
[01:37:08] clotara Albury finally found a way to
[01:37:11] rid himself of the curse
[01:37:14] this all raises far too many questions I
[01:37:17] like his candy time to think
[01:37:19] and to search my memories for some
[01:37:22] missing pieces we should part ways here
[01:37:25] huh well there's a dad I mean who the
[01:37:27] [ __ ] buried the dad then you
[01:37:31] you know it's better yeah yeah I think
[01:37:35] that he might have seen you
[01:37:40] he
[01:37:42] yes
[01:37:43] I have my suspicions as to his identity
[01:37:47] but I need to confirm some other details
[01:37:49] before I can be sure oh he if the time
[01:37:51] is right I will tell you when we next
[01:37:53] meet
[01:37:56] that he saw the traveler how
[01:37:58] possible
[01:38:00] I fear that while these things would
[01:38:02] limit anyone else
[01:38:04] they are no obstacle to him
[01:38:07] why what is he a sinner all right let's
[01:38:11] leave it there
[01:38:13] get some rest
[01:38:15] goodbye goodbye
[01:38:20] there goes Dane and just like that who
[01:38:24] is he again huh

[01:38:35] huh
[01:38:39] wait that's it
[01:38:42] no way we end up all we know is his
[01:38:44] pronouns and then he dips
[01:38:48] it must have been he him
[01:38:51] dude tell me more
[01:39:05] wait who the [ __ ] buried him do you
[01:39:07] think Aether buried him or did he buried
