[00:09:15] hypothetically for do teams uh every Cal
[00:09:18] of everything is super scuffed and
[00:09:20] depends on everything um like attack
[00:09:24] speed even er a lot of that [ __ ] for a

[00:09:51] number but it's usually with hit rate um
[00:09:54] you you Cal it on 30 effector as enemies
[00:09:57] but like level 90 but
[00:09:59] um even if you're 10 or 20% under it's

[00:20:06] gal gal we're going to uh I'm going to
[00:20:08] start with Ki please rise up for our
[00:20:10] Queen dude I was thinking about this off
[00:20:13] stream I think I was literally like
[00:20:15] outside like I don't even know where I
[00:20:16] went where did I go today what the visit
[00:20:18] my grandma anyways I was somewhere
[00:20:19] outside I was thinking like dude if I
[00:20:21] was purely like a like let's say I
[00:20:24] literally was okay I never streamed get
[00:20:26] in my life and I was full casual who
[00:20:29] would be in my team and I was thinking
[00:20:30] about this a lot I I I was like okay you
[00:20:33] for sure you got to have sh in there sh
[00:20:35] that's like number one boom okay then
[00:20:37] I'm like who would I put there and I'll
[00:20:38] say about it I was like
[00:20:41] realistically because shenyun is
[00:20:43] actually like good wish out and she
[00:20:45] looks like that probably these two
[00:20:47] realistically then I think I'd have
[00:20:49] either finina or kakomi probably one of
[00:20:52] the two now I like them both but I feel
[00:20:55] like they'd be redundant cuz they're
[00:20:57] both just like Hydro archon mermaids
[00:20:59] right well not really one's a you get
[00:21:01] the point so like I would choose one I
[00:21:03] don't know which one
[00:21:06] um but like dude literally like let's
[00:21:08] say this this is already a meta it could
[00:21:10] be both it could be both but we need a
[00:21:13] strategy actually it might be this but I
[00:21:16] don't know who the last Char I don't
[00:21:21] know I feel like I'd probably have an
[00:21:23] electro character I like Electro
[00:21:24] characters too much I feel like one of
[00:21:26] either finina or Ki would be an electro
[00:21:28] character and then that would be the
[00:21:29] team and then finina would be on healer
[00:21:31] well I mean she's already a Healer I
[00:21:32] don't need another actually okay then
[00:21:34] probably I I mean I love you kakomi but
[00:21:36] you'd probably go team two then we'
[00:21:38] probably go like y or some
[00:21:40] [ __ ] stun law actually maybe I'll height
[00:21:42] them but I'll height them in this team
[00:21:43] does nothing
[00:21:45] so
[00:21:47] um [ __ ] use aloy she is secretly m i
[00:21:52] mean maybe
[00:21:53] Alan I'm not using
[00:21:56] aloy actually we might use aloy
[00:22:00] I will do as you command all
[00:22:01] right uh okay chat's closed we're going
[00:22:04] to do sh next no wait before do by one
[00:22:07] it could be it could actually be
[00:22:13] official chat I mentioned
[00:22:17] y but it was
[00:22:20] official now what does that tell us
[00:22:22] class H the answer was ficial not Yi hm
[00:22:28] that no I just think that's interesting
[00:22:30] that's all no I think it's a little
[00:22:32] concerning that's all I'm saying I'm not
[00:22:33] implying
[00:22:35] anything I'm not implying
[00:22:37] anything I just think it's
[00:22:41] concerning I just think it's a little
[00:22:45] weird sorry we're going to do Ren Shogun

[00:40:32] was G C6
[00:40:37] no all right chat let's watch best
[00:40:40] artifact for guming Mari versus Crimson
[00:40:45] Witch by the way the real answer is
[00:40:47] they're very similar in strength Mari
[00:40:49] helps you get more crit rate which can
[00:40:50] help with consistency which is typically
[00:40:52] recommended but if you have a lot of
[00:40:54] crit rate like with shenyun serpent
[00:40:56] spine and C6 then you may want to go for
[00:40:59] Crimson Witch uh not because it's better
[00:41:01] but because you might over cap on crit
[00:41:03] rate
[00:41:04] otherwise Here Comes The
[00:41:07] Catch the

[00:50:20] like this you're not going to like this
[00:50:22] dude dude dude dude dude dude you know
[00:50:25] how genin a lot of times when you math
[00:50:27] anything it's like it depends star rail
[00:50:29] is like 50 times that it's so much it
[00:50:33] depends it's crazy and the worst part is
[00:50:35] everyone presents math and then it's
[00:50:36] like it depends 50 times and then
[00:50:38] nothing Lins up and then nothing lines
[00:50:40] up and then everything changes depending
[00:50:41] on one thing but then you have to like
[00:50:43] show a visual of one example so that you
[00:50:46] look like you're right and then sorry
[00:50:49] what are you talking about just mathing
[00:50:50] star real stuff it's
[00:50:53] annoying especially with DOT characters
[00:50:55] will sooner die again coincidentally
[00:50:57] Black
[00:50:59] Swan dude the thing the thing with
[00:51:01] that's the cool part
[00:51:03] no imagine imagine okay imagine imagine
[00:51:08] okay imagine making an Excel sheet okay
[00:51:10] okay okay imagine having to change okay
[00:51:13] imagine okay imagine you can't do math
[00:51:16] though you yink it from other people I
[00:51:19] don't yoink
[00:51:21] it I I use it and I credit it I I I'm a
[00:51:26] $50 a month sub to Z Jeff's patreon
[00:51:29] that's not
[00:51:30] yoinking
[00:51:34] anyways imagine imagine this right
[00:51:37] actually wait black Swan's official info
[00:51:39] is out right Black Swan HSR
[00:51:42] talents official let me let me type
[00:51:44] official so I don't get
[00:51:45] leaks
[00:51:48] uh I think it's in the like notice right
[00:51:51] the [ __ ] notice oh yeah there it is I
[00:51:53] got it yeah yeah here
[00:52:02] cool
[00:52:05] it yeah look so uh ultimate applies
[00:52:09] Epiphany on all enemies for certain
[00:52:10] number of turns enemies affected by
[00:52:11] Epiphany take more damage in their turn
[00:52:13] and their Arcana whatever okay look what
[00:52:16] does this say Epiphany more damage in
[00:52:19] their turn red to that doesn't mean they
[00:52:21] shut oh it's sh
[00:52:24] ABD this doesn't mean they just take
[00:52:27] more damage it's not just flat
[00:52:28] vulnerability like a vulnerability buff
[00:52:30] it's in their turn H okay so the dots
[00:52:34] that they take when their turn starts
[00:52:35] they'll take more
[00:52:37] okay now imagine if you use black Swan's
[00:52:41] ultimate right you're mathing it oh this
[00:52:43] is so good but then the enemy
[00:52:49] moves you don't really have time to use
[00:52:51] any of your character's abilities you
[00:52:53] don't maybe you don't use kafka's skill
[00:52:55] to detonate stuff maybe you didn't even
[00:52:56] have time to apply a lot of dots then
[00:53:00] maybe your lra goes he
[00:53:03] attacks then that same enemy moves again
[00:53:07] cuz maybe it's an enemy with like 200
[00:53:09] well we don't know the speed of new
[00:53:11] enemies but let's say 200 150 180 speed
[00:53:13] enemy they
[00:53:15] go oh [ __ ]
[00:53:18] okay H it would seem two turns of my
[00:53:22] Epiphany is gone
[00:53:24] already I don't even have time to apply
[00:53:27] anything does the alt
[00:53:32] suck I don't know where I'm going with
[00:53:34] this let's watch the
[00:53:36] trailer it does it by the way the all
[00:53:38] doesn't suck
[00:53:40] but wait I need to turn this
[00:53:42] [Music]
[00:53:54] up
[00:53:58] what the [ __ ] was
[00:53:59] [Music]
[00:54:06] that what are you afraid of yo okay they
[00:54:10] are not that big yoj yo
[00:54:14] relax this is just a
[00:54:19] Dreamscape life is a winding
[00:54:23] Labyrinth with memor
[00:54:25] are sole
[00:54:31] companions people believe they're facing
[00:54:33] the present and the
[00:54:35] future yet failed to realize we're all
[00:54:38] moving toward the
[00:54:41] past wait uh black SW how do you move
[00:54:44] how do you move towards the past if
[00:54:45] you're moving how would you go backwards
[00:54:47] are there's more than one destiny to
[00:54:51] choose
[00:54:52] from
[00:54:53] okay yo what the road ahead who is the
[00:54:58] cameraman open your eyes and face your
[00:55:04] fears that was kind of sick how else
[00:55:06] will you find the
[00:55:10] answer there might be
[00:55:15] Death Or Another price to pay dude that
[00:55:20] is like that is such a sick animation
[00:55:22] that is such a cool old but Fe
[00:55:26] not unless I erase them you won't
[00:55:33] forget
[00:55:40] so I'm about to I'm about
[00:55:43] to I'm about to yeah there we
[00:55:48] go please
[00:55:51] ladies anyways uh yeah that trailer was
[00:55:54] good I'm very exced EX for Black Swan
[00:55:55] one of the uh uh in my opinion cooler
[00:55:58] looking
[00:55:59] characters uh I will say from what we
[00:56:02] know officially only if you are like hey
[00:56:05] I want to save my Jades here is my take
[00:56:08] if you like her go for her however I
[00:56:10] recommend getting her basically sorry
[00:56:14] primarily if you have
[00:56:17] Kafka and ideally Black Swan now you
[00:56:22] might be uh what the [ __ ] uh Ron May now
[00:56:25] you might be like Z how do you know this
[00:56:27] well with all the info that we
[00:56:29] know about all her abilities she
[00:56:32] synergizes these are all official she
[00:56:34] synergizes very
[00:56:37] well with Dot and the only other dot
[00:56:40] character that's relevant is Kafka now
[00:56:42] you be like Z what about sampo E4 Z what
[00:56:45] about yeah you could play them okay but
[00:56:47] Kafka just she just she just dominates
[00:56:49] she's just better it is what it is it is
[00:56:50] what it is play who you want anyways so
[00:56:55] that's usually when you would uh uh want
[00:56:58] a Black Swan on your account is for that
[00:57:00] team but if anything I think kfka and
[00:57:03] Black Swan both are very similar in Vibe
[00:57:05] and so if you like one you probably like
[00:57:07] the other I know I
[00:57:09] do um so
[00:57:13] yeah ASA should be good pixel because
[00:57:16] Asa gives you a lot of attack a lot of
[00:57:17] speed what do dot teams want attack
[00:57:20] speed and damage but you know attack and
[00:57:22] speed is
[00:57:23] good
[00:57:25] ASA also gets better with like Adon
[00:57:26] stuff but yeah she she probably a good
[00:57:36] fourstar anyways back to genin I got
[00:57:51] distracted uh I'm going to get this
[00:57:53] Oculus wait I was going for the the
[00:57:56] wayo it's fine I'll get this first wait
[00:57:58] what the [ __ ] was okay okay
[00:58:02] um okay oh was there the [ __ ] is
[00:58:17] this can you use Black Swan with
[00:58:23] Arin
[00:58:32] I don't think that character's out yet
[00:58:34] so we could talk when he's
[00:58:40] out
[00:58:42] reminder dude yeah I I got jump scared
[00:58:46] by Arland in the same tier as sely once
[00:58:49] but we don't talk about
[00:58:53] that
[00:59:03] oh wait one second let me respon to
[00:59:10] something
[00:59:17] [Applause]
[00:59:23] um
[00:59:31] uh something
[00:59:38] [Applause]
[00:59:40] down
[00:59:43] okay how does this happen so often dude
[00:59:46] there should be a warning like like a
[00:59:47] like there's like sirens when you
[00:59:49] approach a unskippable cut scene like a
[00:59:53] and then I leave
[00:59:57] dude imagine each Zone that forces you
[01:00:00] into a cut scene it's like in red P's
[01:00:02] like maybe we should explore the the
[01:00:04] area ahead of us later maybe we should
[01:00:06] why is bad thanks for the dollar Cory
[01:00:10] why is Dea bad okay do you want an
[01:00:12] honest answer or do you want a fun
[01:00:23] answer because
[01:00:25] here's the honest
[01:00:26] answer
[01:00:29] D wait what the [ __ ] do I have to do for
[01:00:31] this chest dude please don't play with
[01:00:34] me right now I'm tired okay I'm sleep
[01:00:36] deprived I've had a long day frankly
[01:00:38] I've had a long week and now there's
[01:00:40] this [ __ ] baby puzzle for [ __ ]
[01:00:42] Toys R Us kids o' clock what what what
[01:00:44] do I have to
[01:00:48] do I'm just going to go to the way point
[01:00:50] you you can have your chest you can keep
[01:00:52] it man I don't care
[01:00:58] anyways uh deaz has a few
[01:01:02] problems um her burst doesn't last very
[01:01:04] long you jump it cancels the damage it
[01:01:07] does is kind of whatever it doesn't work
[01:01:08] with like yolon or SRO or bet uh
[01:01:11] additionally her skill which is a pretty
[01:01:14] nice ability uh has first of all if you
[01:01:17] repress it it doesn't reset the up
[01:01:21] time uh it has very [ __ ] up time
[01:01:25] it gives you Interruption uh resistance
[01:01:26] Interruption which is nice but for like
[01:01:28] 5 Seconds it applies pyro which is nice
[01:01:31] but
[01:01:35] slowly also it expires about halfway
[01:01:39] through your
[01:01:40] rotation and there's no way to reset it
[01:01:43] now you might be like Z it can't be that
[01:01:46] bad how often do you apply
[01:01:48] pyro like once per second 1.5
[01:01:53] seconds5
[01:01:56] 2.5 H one point 2.5 seconds for a pyro
[01:02:01] shot no no way but I mean that has to be
[01:02:03] good right like what's a bad character
[01:02:05] like Dory Dory sucks how often does she
[01:02:08] apply 4 seconds no no no no no I must be
[01:02:11] true point4 no no no no there's no way
[01:02:14] there's no way there's no way what about
[01:02:15] what about um [ __ ] what about kie what
[01:02:17] about
[01:02:18] Kookie every 1.5 okay but but Kookie
[01:02:21] surely kookie's up time isn't
[01:02:27] surely cies up 's not that no but
[01:02:30] there's 3 seconds downtime here it can't
[01:02:32] be
[01:02:34] 100% no but but D must have
[01:02:36] constellations she must have a
[01:02:38] constellation that that fixes everything
[01:02:41] Dam D C2 D
[01:02:44] [Music]
[01:02:46] C2 oh 6 seconds more that's
[01:02:50] nice does it apply pyro more
[01:02:53] often maybe that's
[01:02:57] [Music]
[01:02:59] C4 oh Z C6 looks good Z that's a lot
[01:03:02] more
[01:03:04] damage that's a lot more damage surely
[01:03:06] it's surely it's not equivalent to my CZ
[01:03:09] Hut
[01:03:11] right oh but Shen came out Z Shen y came
[01:03:16] out you can plunge with her now you
[01:03:18] could you could plunge with her
[01:03:22] now you could you can PL with her
[01:03:26] now surely surely she can jump inside of
[01:03:29] her
[01:03:35] [Music]
[01:03:53] Alt
[01:03:57] surely Shan you get save her Del's good
[01:04:00] now what the deluke been bad since 1.
[01:04:03] [ __ ]
[01:04:05] two surely de's good now
[01:04:16] too where'd my burst
[01:04:19] go where the burst goes
[01:04:23] off no it's
[01:04:25] okay best unit in the game Singo he can
[01:04:30] carry her you can have rain swords maybe
[01:04:33] vaporize a
[01:04:41] little Z why are you doing more damage
[01:04:43] outside of your
[01:04:44] [Music]
[01:04:47] burst no it's okay at least you can use
[01:04:49] your
[01:04:50] field it on surely it'll last long
[01:04:53] enough
[01:04:54] surely you won't get knocked
[01:05:02] [Music]
[01:05:05] around your mommy teach you
[01:05:12] that anyway she actually got better with
[01:05:14] nevet though uh one of Net's more
[01:05:16] optimal teams involve running uh him
[01:05:18] alongside de because each different
[01:05:20] reaction you Pro with nevet gives him uh
[01:05:22] stacks of his passive more charge attack
[01:05:23] damage uh a higher charge attack scaling
[01:05:25] actually it's really good uh and I think
[01:05:28] that's how it works it's been a while uh
[01:05:30] and you get to vaporize some hits like
[01:05:31] an occasional vaporize like your burst
[01:05:33] or skill or whatever which is pretty
[01:05:34] good uh and on top of that the
[01:05:36] resistance Interruption even though the
[01:05:38] up time kind of sucks is actually good
[01:05:40] for nevet in particular now why because
[01:05:42] at the start of your rotation you want
[01:05:44] to use your [ __ ] on nevet you're going
[01:05:45] to be close to enemy but then Co you can
[01:05:47] social distance because net massive
[01:05:49] hydroco right remember remember what I
[01:05:51] taught you large Hydro beam so you can
[01:05:54] space backwards and even though de's up
[01:05:56] time isn't as good as like Jong Le
[01:05:58] shield and it will expire well you're
[01:06:00] going to be in [ __ ] Narnia so the
[01:06:02] enemies can't hit you furthermore the
[01:06:04] vaporize is quite nice and she can run a
[01:06:07] supportive artifact set instructure is
[01:06:08] not that great with the let uh sorry
[01:06:11] tenacity of the midth isn't that great
[01:06:12] on nevet but or with nevet because he
[01:06:14] scales on HP but you can go instructor
[01:06:16] ooh that's 120 em so de actually has a
[01:06:19] team where she's quite uh potent if
[01:06:21] you're like a de enjoyer there you go I
[01:06:22] think Deja de
[01:06:24] DEA visually uh looks uh good so I would
[01:06:28] like to run her when I can net Works uh
[01:06:31] she works well in another team
[01:06:33] additionally a bit of a lesser Synergy
[01:06:35] in a scenario where she's almost
[01:06:37] objectively a worse Jang Le but can work
[01:06:39] is with Linny because Linny likes to
[01:06:41] have pyro characters with him why am I
[01:06:43] missing an artifact I don't know but I
[01:06:45] can use the amazing feature fast equip
[01:06:47] right surely surely I can fast surely
[01:06:50] wait what the [ __ ] is [ __ ] it [ __ ] it oh
[01:06:53] [ __ ] it what's my r ratio [ __ ]
[01:06:55] it that's too much crit rate that's
[01:06:57] actually too much crit rate is this good
[01:07:02] okay um I mean it's actually not bad
[01:07:06] except the Goblet it's actually not bad
[01:07:08] except the
[01:07:11] Goblet it's actually not bad except the
[01:07:16] Goblet open Heimer of genin what does
[01:07:19] that have to do with
[01:07:22] anything okay let me give him Vermilion
[01:07:25] fast equip
[01:07:27] custom set
[01:07:30] type
[01:07:33] Vermilion main AIC attack pyro crit
[01:07:39] damage
[01:07:40] generate
[01:07:44] equip oh wait that's
[01:07:49] good too much
[01:07:52] though
[01:07:56] why Vermilion because it's the best set
[01:07:58] in the
[01:08:00] game okay anyways it's actually good
[01:08:05] it's actually
[01:08:09] good all right uh let's go do
[01:08:12] Vermillion speaking of which speak of
[01:08:14] the devil let's go do

[01:12:01] good all good all good no big deal love
[01:12:06] to see it hate to be
[01:12:11] it make
[01:12:16] way why are you in
[01:12:21] Vermilion why am I in Vermillion
[01:12:26] why
[01:12:29] does why does Arnold lift
[01:12:33] weights why does Michael Phelps swim why
[01:12:36] does LeBron James shoot the
[01:12:41] basketball why does Messi kick the
[01:12:46] ball cuz it's what you
[01:12:50] do if you spend I don't know one year
[01:12:55] two years three
[01:12:58] years
[01:13:00] losing getting beat
[01:13:03] up trying to achieve your goal what are
[01:13:06] you going to do are you going to say oh
[01:13:08] it's been 3 years there's no point in
[01:13:10] going on oh maybe I should call it quits
[01:13:14] maybe I should cut my losses or
[01:13:17] so you say
[01:13:19] huh well I've put a lot of effort in
[01:13:22] cost fallacy I put a lot of effort in
[01:13:24] and I've
[01:13:26] learned I've bettered myself as a human
[01:13:29] in this domain I've learned through the
[01:13:34] domain why would I stop now if I stop
[01:13:37] now no I'm being reasonable if I stop
[01:13:39] now the last three years have been a
[01:13:41] waste but if I keep going and I get a
[01:13:44] good piece then it was a smart
[01:13:46] investment now you could say Z that's
[01:13:48] that's fair right that's fair but can't
[01:13:50] you just strong box yes and that is the
[01:13:52] main flaw of the logic is that I could
[01:13:54] go strong box and honestly I might
[01:13:58] but what if we Vermilion with resin and
[01:14:02] then the bad Vermilion we strongbox into
[01:14:04] good
[01:14:06] Vermilion now that's a pretty good AR
[01:14:08] that's a pretty good uh
[01:14:11] argument
[01:14:13] now you could also say Z hey man I'm a
[01:14:17] sh right I'm a sh and I I have a genuine
[01:14:21] question please answer honestly okay
[01:14:22] please ask your question z uh I just got
[01:14:26] sh I'm new to the game ar50 I mean I've
[01:14:29] been playing but you know I'm still
[01:14:30] leveling I just hit
[01:14:32] ar50 I really want to get better
[01:14:34] artifacts what should I farm man should
[01:14:38] I go Vermillion like you you're my idol
[01:14:40] man should I go to
[01:14:43] [Music]
[01:14:45] Vermillion
[01:14:47] look young one please listen I would say

[01:14:53] you should be a good productive member
[01:14:57] of society right I have high help others
[01:15:00] that need
[01:15:01] help and help yourself too and you
[01:15:05] should Farm Mar chose Hunter it's good
[01:15:07] on basically any character with finina
[01:15:10] it's good on a lot of font 10 characters
[01:15:12] it's good on Shia you could also get
[01:15:14] golden troop fal's best set good on yai
[01:15:17] if you want good on aita if you're not
[01:15:18] going deepwood good on some other
[01:15:20] [ __ ] supports it's a good set
[01:15:24] okay well what if uh what if I went ver
[01:15:26] million
[01:15:27] instead well you could but Echo
[01:15:32] sucks and it doesn't work on high ping
[01:15:34] and the only character it's best install
[01:15:36] on got powerc okay well uh what about
[01:15:39] Vermillion well you could use it on a
[01:15:40] lot of characters but
[01:15:43] um okay so I should go marosi but how
[01:15:46] does Mar compare to to Ona surely
[01:15:49] Vermillion is just better well they're
[01:15:52] actually pretty similar and if you're
[01:15:55] low investment well you can get crit
[01:15:57] raate for free with the set so it makes
[01:15:59] it easier to build oh okay so uh I
[01:16:04] shouldn't do
[01:16:05] Vermillion then why are you still doing
[01:16:08] it team well good question chatter good
[01:16:11] question man because if I don't do
[01:16:15] it then I'm a quitter let the world come
[01:16:18] and how can
[01:16:20] I okay listen listen this is a good one
[01:16:24] how can I tell you what to do if I don't
[01:16:27] follow my own advice I would be nothing
[01:16:29] but a yapper if I didn't have a good
[01:16:31] Vermilion set could you imagine
[01:16:35] if imagine two scenarios one oh Z
[01:16:39] finally has the best Vermilion in the
[01:16:42] game boom rank one sh that's scenario
[01:16:44] one scenario 2 yeah he gave up he tried
[01:16:49] he tried but he gave
[01:16:51] up now me
[01:16:55] personally if I'm in a Choose Your Own
[01:16:57] Adventure series and that's what life is
[01:17:00] Right Choose Your Own
[01:17:01] Adventure
[01:17:04] personally I would choose the
[01:17:09] ladder anyway I hope that answered your
[01:17:11] question um but we got nothing good I'm
[01:17:14] going to go get uh I'm going to use a
[01:17:15] fragile I don't care
[01:17:22] I'm
[01:17:24] what was the question uh you could
[01:17:25] scroll up in
[01:17:27] chat ladder means you will give up wait
[01:17:30] no but I thought I said wait I said no I
[01:17:33] said the former was give up I don't know
[01:17:36] whatever [ __ ] you I fine you give up
[01:17:39] then I don't
[01:17:41] care I'm trying
[01:17:44] to okay realistically I say this but my
[01:17:47] sh's already like the best like
[01:17:48] technically cuz shenyun gives you 10
[01:17:50] crit rate and we're like top 30 it's
[01:17:53] literally already perfect sh so we can
[01:17:55] already make the perfect sh video which
[01:17:57] means like I can already make a video
[01:17:59] being like I spent 3 years right which
[01:18:01] means that me continuing to farm
[01:18:03] Vermilion actually serves no purpose it
[01:18:06] actually serves no
[01:18:12] purpose the feeling's
[01:18:21] mutual

[01:28:01] huh so was your ratio uh about the
[01:28:05] same uh what date was this what date was
[01:28:07] this posted let's see in February
[01:28:10] 2021 so three years
[01:28:13] ago was your shout about as
[01:28:16] good huh you must not have farmed for
[01:28:19] him much after then that's fine like if
[01:28:21] you have a really good sh build 3 years
[01:28:22] ago then uh that's okay you probably
[01:28:24] just stopped farming so it's okay like
[01:28:26] it's okay you probably didn't waste any
[01:28:28] more resin so it's
[01:28:30] fine also why are people saying why are
[01:28:34] people saying no ER I do I have to bring
[01:28:38] this up every time I I talk about Shia
[01:28:40] I'm in a triple [ __ ] Animo team with
[01:28:43] finina and a C6 farzon who has favonius
[01:28:46] warbo and my Shia has C1 even if I'm not
[01:28:50] using C6 I at least have C1 why the [ __ ]
[01:28:52] would I need
[01:28:54] energy if literally if I have zero
[01:28:57] energy and I use all my abilities I get
[01:28:59] my burst
[01:29:03] back watch this Tik Tok I'm not watching
[01:29:06] a Tik Tok I'm not watching a Tik
[01:29:20] Tok
[01:29:35] what is
[01:29:39] this dude is this an edit okay I'm not
[01:29:43] watching
[01:29:45] this I'm actually not watching
[01:29:50] that
[01:29:53] how does it feel that Shia isn't special
[01:29:57] anymore imitation is this most sincere
[01:30:00] form of
[01:30:02] flattery it is I've seen
[01:30:06] [ __ ] I've seen I'm going to say
[01:30:08] it I'm sorry do you know how many
[01:30:10] [ __ ] I've seen with the exact
[01:30:12] same thumbnails as my graphic designer
[01:30:14] not me I don't do anything original as
[01:30:16] him every time I see one I give him a
[01:30:18] raise I'm like hey that's another bonus
[01:30:21] this month
[01:30:23] it's flattery sh if if [ __ ] Mr Beast
[01:30:26] posts a video and then 10 other people
[01:30:28] copy it would you be like oh how does it
[01:30:30] feel now that now that there's people
[01:30:33] copying
[01:30:34] you I'm sorry your Walmart ass Shia
[01:30:38] characters can't do anything that Shia
[01:30:41] can I'm sorry your du okay the's

[01:31:01] with uh Shen Yun can make punch teams
[01:31:03] they're pretty cool I actually like her
[01:31:04] a lot but to be fair to shiao because a
[01:31:08] lot of people aren't fair to Shia his
[01:31:10] AOE is huge so he makes use of plunging
[01:31:13] a lot better than most characters who
[01:31:16] even though they can be really good now
[01:31:18] with plunging in any form of AOE sha
[01:31:21] would usually be a lot better but in
[01:31:22] single Target yeah I might rather play

[01:39:16] 174k 170k sha could never genin could
[01:39:20] never
[01:39:21] oh I [ __ ] my e were
[01:39:24] off here comes the
[01:39:32] catch okay I am not critting my who like
[01:39:36] negative crit not bad
[01:39:38] though not
[01:39:43] bad I'm C4 far on but sh and finina what
[01:39:46] do I do um the good content creator in
[01:39:50] me wants to say hey don't worry about it
[01:39:53] you can still play that it's fine the
[01:39:55] bad content creator in me wants to say
[01:39:58] pull so uh Choose Your Own
[01:40:01] Adventure what do you want to
[01:40:10] hear I'm going to
[01:40:12] do no I'm not I'm not pulling never
[01:40:19] mind
[01:40:31] what's your Hut build glad you asked our
[01:40:33] Hut is on the staff of Homer uh she is
[01:40:36] C1 she is crowned 1099 will eventually
[01:40:39] Triple Crown it is what it is artifacts
[01:40:41] we have four CRI wit of flames uh
[01:40:43] amazing almost 50 crit value flower with
[01:40:45] an HP Roll by the way an HP stat uh
[01:40:48] that's pretty good feather is okay HP uh
[01:40:51] a lot of crit okay I like to see that
[01:40:53] plume sorry Sans has a crit rate crit
[01:40:56] damage and EM as a HP main stat I have
[01:40:59] another HP S that I can use but uh I
[01:41:01] like this one cuz it gives me a bit of
[01:41:02] em uh goblet now I have a really good
[01:41:04] onset pyro goblet for shimaa but the
[01:41:08] problem is I could go shy Hut is
[01:41:10] actually pretty good but uh what my Hut
[01:41:13] actually needs is em because I don't
[01:41:14] have Anem sand so we're going for a
[01:41:16] goblet that gives me 77 em and some crit
[01:41:19] rate because I need em on my out uh for
[01:41:21] the circlet we have uh this one right
[01:41:23] here that has 23 em 22 crit damage for a
[01:41:26] total ratio of 82 225 with 145 em and
[01:41:30] 32k HP now also more HP with like Hydro
[01:41:33] well I think we have hydro res right now
[01:41:34] I but with Hydro I'm not in the party
[01:41:36] but hyd res also gives you more HP at
[01:41:38] that point em Sands would be better so
[01:41:40] we could swap but it is what it is uh
[01:41:42] also I noticed that if I go this circlet
[01:41:44] I actually have a 222 crit damage so
[01:41:46] this is my
[01:41:47] build
[01:41:49] okay
[01:42:02] more em or shenyun yeah shenyun also uh
[01:42:05] benefits a lot from em because kind of
[01:42:07] like icy quills it gets multiplied when
[01:42:09] you uh Vape so that is a fair point we
[01:42:11] really want an em S I just don't have a
[01:42:13] good em sand uh I've been I've been
[01:42:15] farming I farm witch a lot at the start
[01:42:16] of the game I never got one we literally
[01:42:19] don't I think I might have have one that
[01:42:20] has like no crit but that's it yeah I
[01:42:23] could strong box but I don't want
[01:42:27] to uh I also don't have a good pyro
[01:42:29] Goblin on set use Mar CH
[01:42:34] no I do think Mar CH is a livesaver for
[01:42:37] a lot of Hut players though because Hut
[01:42:39] notoriously very difficult to get crit
[01:42:41] rate on because you have hom and uh I'm
[01:42:44] pretty sure she as sends crit
[01:42:46] damage so it's kind of hard so mag helps
[01:42:49] a lot with that
[01:42:53] like I'm on a crit rate circlet seven
[01:42:55] crit rate here seven 14 crit rate 13
[01:42:59] crit rate 11 crit rate like it's you can
[01:43:01] get more than that but it's hard and I
[01:43:03] still only have 80 too so like Mar shy
[01:43:07] helps a lot but Shan Yun also gives you
[01:43:09] like up to
[01:43:19] 10
[01:43:33] when will you do EU
[01:43:36] reviews
[01:43:37] [Music]
[01:43:39] EU EU
[01:43:48] reviews yeah the problem Mar SA is it's
[01:43:50] good on everyone so I I just don't like
[01:43:53] like let's say I have a good like a good
[01:43:55] build on a character I don't want to
[01:43:57] [ __ ] just oh Mar oh Mar say oh and
[01:43:59] then literally every character has to
[01:44:00] use that
[01:44:08] set what if I let what if I let fast
[01:44:11] equip decide my sh build [ __ ]
[01:44:14] it I want to see what genin thinks is my
[01:44:17] optimal sh build we're going to do fast
[01:44:20] equip quick
[01:44:26] configuration all this is like basic
[01:44:29] okay I
[01:44:31] mean only 81 c
[01:44:35] r
[01:44:37] um what if I
[01:44:40] do custom
[01:44:45] Loadout actually I mean this works
[01:44:47] unironically but um
[01:44:53] what is my marish Shi builds do I even
[01:44:56] have okay wait let me just equip
[01:45:01] them I'll just change my

[02:53:25] let's go together and when this God
[02:53:27] stirs up a win loads of ore gets exposed

[02:53:38] we'd be rich if we got in on the action
[02:53:40] somehow you're catching my
[02:53:43] drift
[02:53:47] chat okay real talk though scale of 1 to
[02:53:51] 10 what do you think the resemblance is
[02:53:54] between me and this guy cuz I think
[02:53:56] hairwise it's similar he has a different
[02:53:58] like he has a mustache and a beard so
[02:54:00] that's minus one point but build Wise
[02:54:02] It's in my opinion I might be
[02:54:06] biased round a one to one anyway going
[02:54:10] to stay put in five five is not even bad
[02:54:14] okay actually I'll take five I'll
[02:54:16] actually take five a who's this it's
[02:54:19] perfect for
[02:54:25] skyers headed straight for the
[02:54:30] what a of that selective reading dude if
[02:54:33] everyone types zero look if everyone
[02:54:36] types zero and a like one person types
[02:54:39] five the five is clearly reasonable cuz
[02:54:41] it's there's no way zero is like
[02:54:43] realistic
[02:54:44] shs it ain't nothing I'll leave this
[02:54:47] like obviously I'm going to read the one
