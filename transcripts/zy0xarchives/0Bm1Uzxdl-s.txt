[00:00:02] say it oh dude I felt so bad I felt so
[00:00:05] bad so many people in the comments were
[00:00:08] like okay I don't want to I don't want
[00:00:10] to roast but so many people were
[00:00:13] like underrated video but no shinan
[00:00:17] she's the real underrated character and
[00:00:19] I just want to be
[00:00:20] like I just want to crush their dreams
[00:00:23] but I can't they're too they're too
[00:00:25] wholesome they're too pure what do I
[00:00:26] have to do
[00:00:31] seriously what do I have to do what the
[00:00:34] [ __ ] am I
[00:00:41] dumb I've done everything I could don't
[00:00:45] try
[00:00:45] shinan yeah I yeah so my argument with
[00:00:51] shenan is like genin is pretty balanced
[00:00:55] and not that hard endgame wise to where
[00:00:57] you can play the characters you like so
[00:00:59] shenan is still viable but her scalings
[00:01:01] are just bad so you can't like it's just
[00:01:03] it's
[00:01:04] copium uh Dom thanks for the three mon3
[00:01:06] sub I think you're Dom if not lotion one
[00:01:09] ex three months dude what the [ __ ] is
[00:01:10] this
[00:01:11] commission oh it's not me I hate you I
[00:01:15] no no Take that
[00:01:18] flower
[00:01:20] back take take that flower we're back
[00:01:25] okay I'm leaving I forgot I was in Co-op
[00:01:27] guys
[00:01:33] okay but Cod shenan true Cod shenan
[00:01:41] POG I'm like the dude it's weird cuz I'm
[00:01:44] like the
[00:01:45] biggest Enthusiast no the
[00:01:49] biggest what is the word the biggest
[00:01:51] like like advocator
[00:01:55] advocation the biggest
[00:02:02] Advocate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm the biggest
[00:02:09] advocate for uh shut up chat I'm the
[00:02:13] biggest advocate for
[00:02:16] um for like playing who you like but
[00:02:19] since I make videos I can't mislead
[00:02:21] people or I try not to so like I can't
[00:02:24] say like haha yeah Noel is the
[00:02:28] underrated healer like I can't I
[00:02:30] wouldn't I feel like I'm just being like
[00:02:33] like I'm lying so like I feel
[00:02:37] like I don't it's weird cuz Okay okay
[00:02:40] it's weird cuz here's the real talk
[00:02:45] okay I'm serious there's no need for
[00:02:47] shenen in this game she has a PVP
[00:02:49] Bruiser kit all right chat code said it
[00:02:52] himself but like the thing is like I
[00:02:54] genuinely believe if you're going to
[00:02:56] have more fun playing shenan than
[00:02:57] playing guu you should play shenan right
[00:03:00] but I can't put that in a video because
[00:03:01] if I do then like I'm giving like false
[00:03:05] information or whatever so I can't say
[00:03:07] anything like that cuz I'm not
[00:03:09] stupid um but yeah do whatever you want
[00:03:13] it's just she's never optimal for like
[00:03:15] Abyss right now at least well yeah her
[00:03:18] skillings are just low it's weird cuz
[00:03:19] some characters have like niches that
[00:03:21] might be good in the future like
[00:03:24] Hut um like couta is good but like
[00:03:26] against one enemy she's so much better
[00:03:28] than like
[00:03:30] than against like 10 enemies
[00:03:35] right uh sorry I [ __ ] covered my trat
[00:03:37] back one sec I don't know
[00:03:39] how make a copium guide for players who
[00:03:42] want to use their faves yeah I mean
[00:03:43] that's why I try to um I try to make
[00:03:45] guid on every character and that's why
[00:03:47] like I've talked about this in another
[00:03:48] stream but this is why uh it upset me
[00:03:51] when people were angry that I like made
[00:03:53] a Chichi build and stuff because I think
[00:03:55] every character
[00:03:57] should have like guides on and you
[00:03:59] should be able to play every character
[00:04:00] optimally even if that character isn't
[00:04:02] optimal right cuz you're going to play
[00:04:03] who you like so I do believe there needs
[00:04:05] to be Shang Ling uh shenan guys I I
[00:04:07] believe there needs to be chii guys I
[00:04:09] believe you know all that [ __ ] uh
[00:04:11] because people are going to play who
[00:04:12] they like so it's like if you're going
[00:04:13] to play this character cuz you play who
[00:04:15] you like then you should learn to play
[00:04:17] them ultimately right if you want to you
[00:04:19] know like play how you want but um yeah
[00:04:22] the shling and hoow work in the same
[00:04:25] team I don't know I haven't tried it but
[00:04:27] I feel like it it's not ideal um unless
[00:04:29] you're running like mono pyro which is
[00:04:32] like cuta Shang Ling venti but again I
[00:04:35] haven't tested
[00:04:39] it find it amazing that you can talk so
[00:04:41] well and play genjin at the same time uh
[00:04:44] I
[00:04:45] mean it's not that hard of a game I'm
[00:04:49] just chilling don't worry and a lot of
[00:04:51] the times I'll die and then just blame
[00:04:53] the talking so it's a good excuse
[00:05:02] chat No Cap I'm becoming I'm kind of I'm
[00:05:05] okay boys if we ever
[00:05:09] stream okay chat if I ever stream a game
[00:05:12] where it's like competitive you know
[00:05:15] let's say OverWatch let's say valerant
[00:05:17] right I'm going to need you guys I just
[00:05:18] want you guys to know from now in the
[00:05:20] future you guys have to only POG
[00:05:22] whenever I do something good and then
[00:05:23] just be just no comment if I [ __ ] up
[00:05:26] okay I we can't have my chat devolving
[00:05:29] until like xqcs chat okay that's not
[00:05:31] what we're going for here I just want
[00:05:32] this to be
[00:05:36] clear no I'm kidding I'm kidding say do
[00:05:40] whatever your OverWatch rank I peaked
[00:05:43] Masters I'm trash now though I'm like
[00:05:45] diamond but I've been starting to play
[00:05:47] valerant and aim carries over but I have
[00:05:49] no game knowledge so I don't know where
[00:05:51] to stand I don't know how my abilities
[00:05:53] work but if I One V one someone I
[00:05:54] usually win cuz I actually have okay
[00:05:57] decent aim like not amazing aame but you
[00:06:00] know good
[00:06:06] enough I know you're a juicer I saw your
[00:06:09] comment on his video I I like xcc I
[00:06:11] don't watch all of his things he [ __ ]
[00:06:14] I I mainly watch him when he played
[00:06:15] OverWatch genuinely and then I watch

[00:06:37] peaches I'm trolling but uh yeah I watch
[00:06:40] a lot of
[00:06:42] people what agent do you use I just use
[00:06:44] Raina cuz I don't need to learn her
[00:06:46] abilities like I'm new so I'm just like
[00:06:48] okay I'll let my aim carry me and I
[00:06:51] don't need to ever think about how to
[00:06:52] use raina's abilities cuz I kill someone
[00:06:54] and then I press a button that's my
[00:06:55] logic

[00:11:15] feature my videos cuz most of their like
[00:11:17] a lot of their like information was bad
[00:11:19] from what I could tell I don't use the
[00:11:20] website but people have told me like a
[00:11:22] lot of the shit's bad but they feature
[00:11:23] my [ __ ] so hey easy clap easy showcase
[00:11:27] action
[00:11:29] [Music]
[00:11:34] gold do we have enough gold o do I do it
[00:11:37] chat do I Mark
[00:11:41] history okay if I get a three star I'll
[00:11:43] level it if I get a three star I'll
[00:11:45] level if I get a four star we're not
[00:11:48] leveling Mi hoyo what do you think okay
[00:11:50] we're leveling
[00:11:53] it I don't twitch that often so I'm not
[00:11:55] really understanding these twitch
[00:11:56] language there's a plugin known as
[00:11:58] better TTV and another known as franker
[00:12:00] face Z it lets you see twitch emotes
[00:12:01] they're also above my head so when
[00:12:03] people type something like POG youu it
[00:12:05] makes a face that you can see above my
[00:12:07] head but it's basically just an emote
[00:12:09] that's a cooler emote so when I say
[00:12:10] something like damn that was copium
[00:12:12] there's an emote called copium which is
[00:12:14] basically you being high on coping which
[00:12:16] I think originates from the people that
[00:12:17] thought like Trump won the election and
[00:12:19] was fraudulent which was [ __ ]
[00:12:21] stupid but anyways so yeah that was
[00:12:23] where copium comes from and now we say
[00:12:25] copium when we get an artifact that is
[00:12:27] like okay right okay anyways
[00:12:31] is genin L A good guide you I don't know
[00:12:35] but from what I can tell no so usually
[00:12:37] the okay my YouTube channel is pretty
[00:12:39] good hey we got the math guy Z Jeff on
[00:12:42] Deck but we can you can also use like
[00:12:44] Theory crafting Discord so like kaching
[00:12:46] Mains are good and then there's main CH
[00:12:48] a main Discord for most uh
[00:12:51] Mains and they're usually they're pretty
[00:12:53] cool I'm in most of
[00:12:54] [Music]
[00:12:57] them except one that I
[00:13:00] but apart from that one they're all
[00:13:02] cool should I pull CLE 5c3 Yan uh
[00:13:06] whoever you like better they're
[00:13:07] basically Yan is like budget CLE uh I
[00:13:11] don't know if at C3 she becomes better
[00:13:13] or not but I would say just use the one
[00:13:14] you like more is it worth pulling for
[00:13:17] another version of the same character no
[00:13:19] but if you like CLE better then go ahead
[00:13:22] basically
[00:13:26] uh pick up razor Ms dude razor Ms are
[00:13:29] are so [ __ ] uh so wholesome razor
[00:13:31] mans made me razor Ms are the reason I
[00:13:35] talk in any Discord like I'm very active
[00:13:37] in a lot of communities but only because
[00:13:40] of Razor mans cuz like I was
[00:13:43] like yeah I don't
[00:13:45] know uh what I dude okay I'm lost today
[00:13:48] let me Focus up okay we're going to
[00:13:49] level shingu we're going to level his
[00:13:50] burst and his
[00:13:53] e
[00:13:57] boom boom
[00:14:02] is Alo good with MTH yes it's a good set
[00:14:05] for
[00:14:09] him all right
[00:14:15] easy King man's website is insane yes it
[00:14:17] really is I uh a lot of my bet guide was
[00:14:22] with uh Zantos and zanto is like the
[00:14:24] dude in King man that does beta stuff
[00:14:26] he's very cool so yeah anyways I'm going
[00:14:29] to do this this clear I want to
[00:14:31] do is autow Ula uh whichever you like
[00:14:35] more they're both good enough if you're
[00:14:36] asking which one's better probably Hut
[00:14:39] uh the only problem with is that she
[00:14:40] steals your shingu and YULA doesn't
[00:14:42] that's the only argument favor in favor
[00:14:44] of YULA um but yeah I would
[00:14:47] go chat I was thinking what's my top
[00:14:49] five
[00:14:51] supports and I'm very
[00:14:54] uh I know who they are I just it's
[00:14:57] really hard to order the top four it's
[00:14:59] very hard gen tier list the sauce what
[00:15:02] is it let me open
[00:15:05] it oh yeah this is oh yeah this is Mega
[00:15:09] sauce yeah Shang Ling should be there
[00:15:12] Hut should be
[00:15:15] down Bennett's fine chingu is fine J's
[00:15:18] fine G is fine vent's fine only Hut
[00:15:20] shouldn't be here and then Shang Ling
[00:15:22] should be there and then child should
[00:15:25] also well it dep I mean I think G should
[00:15:26] be a tier of her own but and then Shia
[00:15:29] should also yeah yeah this is weird
[00:15:31] there's no in no world is Hut better
[00:15:32] than Shia if you think Hut is better
[00:15:34] than Shia you're delusional I'm sorry
[00:15:35] actually that's not true you might not
[00:15:36] play the game a lot you might be misled
[00:15:38] by other Char content creators I'm not
[00:15:40] going to Flame people that don't know a
[00:15:41] lot about the game it's okay it's okay
[00:15:43] to not know it's okay to be misled it's
[00:15:46] okay to not invest that much time in the
[00:15:48] game do math about the game that's fine
[00:15:50] but sh is
[00:15:53] better okay anyways anyways let's go
[00:15:57] Abyss
[00:16:00] okay I can be more precise I can be more
[00:16:01] precise Hut is better against one enemy
[00:16:03] Shia's better because his AOE is
[00:16:05] extremely consistent so he's good
[00:16:06] overall especially in the current end
[00:16:07] game content that's why uh there all the
[00:16:10] end game content is AOE all the end game
[00:16:12] content is multiple enemies so Hut's
[00:16:15] still good but Shia is Shia is as good
[00:16:18] against one like one or two enemies as
[00:16:20] he is against 10 or 20 or 50 and he's
[00:16:22] never not going to do his AOE like
[00:16:24] there's no setup you can be you can play
[00:16:26] with your eyes closed and still hit
[00:16:28] everything
[00:16:29] whereas Hut will kill one enemy very
[00:16:31] well maybe two enemies but
[00:16:35] yeah Hut is good because damage Shia is
[00:16:38] good because Shia yeah I mean yo Hut's
[00:16:40] good I'm not I'm not bashing her I'm
[00:16:41] just saying anyways uh last character
[00:16:43] CFT to gear Shing Chu I kind of want to
[00:16:45] give him Skyward I think Alexi told me
[00:16:47] to use Skyward on this team over a sack
[00:16:50] so we're going to do
[00:16:52] that we are going to do that smile I'm
[00:16:55] going to run a two-piece hydration set
[00:16:59] um with a two-piece
[00:17:01] noblis do you have any noblis with a lot
[00:17:03] of uh ER this doesn't have any
[00:17:11] ER yeah I might need more
[00:17:16] ER dude I need to farm no blast I'm
[00:17:19] jealous of codes [ __ ] no blast pieces
[00:17:21] I'm so jealous this is one of the
[00:17:22] domains that I've been neglect oh I
[00:17:24] think it's one where um the it's
[00:17:26] probably my most unlucky domain but also
[00:17:28] I've been collecting it uh am I
[00:17:31] geared I have three pieces let's run an
[00:17:35] offset feather maybe what was kind of
[00:17:37] Juicy that's kind of that's kind
[00:17:38] of okay okay what all right it's not bad
[00:17:42] I mean 50 crit rate is not a lot but
[00:17:44] it's fine uh can we get a bit more crit
[00:17:47] rate maybe maybe on the
[00:17:49] feather
[00:17:53] okay okay that's a start what if we say
[00:17:56] [ __ ] you energy recharge and we do this
[00:17:59] ever ever ever think about this it's
[00:18:01] actually not bad yeah I like that what
[00:18:04] up best
[00:18:05] Tre so diplomatic not wanting to upset
[00:18:07] chat it's just I don't want people to um
[00:18:11] when I try
[00:18:12] to explain why one character is better
[00:18:15] than another I don't want people to
[00:18:16] think that character is bad so if I say
[00:18:19] like if I'm comparing huta and duuk and
[00:18:23] a lot of people have like [ __ ] on duuke
[00:18:25] really hard because of Shang Ling right
[00:18:27] and if you're comparing Shang Ling and
[00:18:28] duuk yes I'm going to tell you the 500
[00:18:30] reasons why Shang Ling is so good but
[00:18:33] that doesn't mean duuke is useless and I
[00:18:35] know Alexi thinks otherwise but hey just
[00:18:37] hear me out when I'm tell telling you
[00:18:39] why one character is so good I always am
[00:18:43] scared that I'm bashing the other
[00:18:45] character too much because realistically
[00:18:47] they're both good and you should play
[00:18:49] the one you like I'm just explaining why
[00:18:50] one is better basically anyways we're
[00:18:52] going to run I want to try TF Bennett
[00:18:55] I'm pretty bad at this comp but I want
[00:18:56] to get used to it cuz apparently it's
[00:18:58] very strong
[00:19:08] um I think this is the order I can't
[00:19:11] remember but I think that's it also my
[00:19:13] sh stats are kind of scuffed um I don't
[00:19:16] know what's on them I didn't check but I
[00:19:17] assume they're kind of
[00:19:19] scuffed you have a vid on changling I
[00:19:21] don't know why she's good I do I have I
[00:19:23] talk about her in well I have a Shang
[00:19:24] Ling guide but in my last video I talked
[00:19:25] about her and it's only like a three
[00:19:26] minute section so you could just skip to
[00:19:28] it and
[00:19:29] uh you'll get everything in 3 minutes
[00:19:31] but quick rundown she vaporizes every
[00:19:33] hit her burst snapshots if you don't
[00:19:34] know what that is I explain it and it
[00:19:36] hits everything around her so it's very
[00:19:37] good against multiple enemies TR require
[00:19:40] C4 she doesn't she just better at
[00:19:49] C4 all right let's go
[00:20:00] I think this is the Order Perfect Parry
[00:20:03] boom look at this damage look at this
[00:20:04] damage press one if this damage is
[00:20:06] unparalleled unprecedented unbelievable
[00:20:10] insane
[00:20:12] oblivious
[00:20:14] atrocious dude that that was actually
[00:20:17] hey that was actually pretty good that
[00:20:19] was actually pretty good why are you
[00:20:21] guys pressing two I killed the Jew
[00:20:23] bishop and okay all right
[00:20:26] okay that was not bad
[00:20:32] No Cap I think I'm going to uh I think
[00:20:35] if I talk about this team in a video I'm
[00:20:36] going to call it the best team you never
[00:20:38] heard of cuz who the [ __ ] that isn't a
[00:20:41] theory crafter knows about TF Bennett
[00:20:43] actually not even that what I said was
[00:20:45] not true who that isn't that doesn't
[00:20:47] watch [ __ ] ZF stream plays TF Bennett
[00:20:50] literally nobody oh that was the wrong
[00:20:52] order I'm supposed to Ben atol after
[00:20:53] that's fine
[00:21:04] the B C2 yes my my fourstar characters
[00:21:05] have constellations my five stars
[00:21:07] usually don't or have like one to two
[00:21:09] usually one but or zero to one but my
[00:21:11] duuke has two
[00:21:13] so okay this was a bad this was a bad
[00:21:16] clear I I want to try to get a good
[00:21:26] one that being said if you ask me Z do
[00:21:29] you like TF Bennett I will still say no
[00:21:31] but it's pretty it's pretty
[00:21:33] good I just I I don't know I don't like
[00:21:36] playing it's just there's so many like
[00:21:39] supports I want to run with dude what is
[00:21:41] this Ang okay no no we're respectful
[00:21:43] chat we're respectful we do not we do
[00:21:45] not objectify characters in this stream
[00:21:48] we are
[00:21:49] respectful it was just a weird
[00:21:52] angle dude why are these plants not
[00:21:54] teleporting to
[00:21:57] me dude what are the PLS doing what okay
[00:22:00] what is this guy
[00:22:02] doing I'm done bro he teleport okay I'm
[00:22:10] done does B snapshot yes BOS does Shang
[00:22:14] Ling does but I think uh shingu doesn't
[00:22:16] which is why I use his burst before
[00:22:18] Bennett I might be wrong but I think I'm
[00:22:20] not wrong uh Prince Aaron thanks for the
[00:22:22] tier one extended through July
[00:22:25] POG appreciate you seriously
[00:22:30] where are they like this guy just
[00:22:32] doesn't teleport what is
[00:22:37] this I want to use my counter but
[00:22:39] they're not attacking yeah whatever it's
[00:22:42] fine I'll get a better clear later this
[00:22:45] is not bad
[00:22:48] though here we go again boom boom
[00:22:53] pow okay my EAS on cool down
[00:22:58] oh dude I'm one ER short okay whatever
[00:23:00] my bet is on ER wise I need like one
[00:23:04] more unless I'm just bad at rotations
[00:23:06] which I might be so hold your C
[00:23:09] W's do snap shot yeah yeah I'm just
[00:23:12] always worried that I forget cuz a lot
[00:23:15] of abilities like like kaay and stuff
[00:23:17] like I know if they snap on then I
[00:23:19] forget so there's too many
[00:23:30] [Music]
[00:23:34] how does this team work does TF proc on
[00:23:36] other characters burst no uh every time
[00:23:39] Bennett's e and okay I might not
[00:23:42] understand the full extent of this comp
[00:23:43] cuz I just started playing it but
[00:23:45] basically uh tf's TF Bennett presses
[00:23:49] Bennett presses e it overloads and it
[00:23:52] vaporizes um but yeah whatever the
[00:23:55] basically it it it does a lot of damage
[00:23:57] because of that but but mainly because
[00:23:59] of uh you can use it every second
[00:24:01] because when it overloads or when it
[00:24:02] procs a reaction an electro reaction
[00:24:05] which is overload um the cool down of
[00:24:07] your e goes to 0.8 seconds because of
[00:24:11] Bennett's already low cool down on the E
[00:24:13] basically and this isn't with the super
[00:24:15] Vape bug by the way I think unless it
[00:24:18] might be with but the Cs I've seen were
[00:24:20] without it I don't know if it's patched
[00:24:22] out or not but I know that when it is
[00:24:25] like the Cs I've seen were assuming it
[00:24:27] was patched out so
[00:24:29] it was fixed yeah okay so yeah this is
[00:24:30] without
[00:24:32] it yeah
[00:24:38] yeah easy
[00:24:42] clap all right uh apparently this half
[00:24:45] is a lot harder for this team is what I
[00:24:48] heard is that true or is that a lie we
[00:24:51] will see Boom Pow then I hit him with a
[00:24:54] boom and then I'm just going to e
[00:24:56] without I think this is enough particles
[00:24:57] right yeah okay
[00:24:59] cool all right that was oh also chat if
[00:25:02] you guys you guys are used to me having
[00:25:04] good artifacts right my Bennett I should
[00:25:06] you not I'm not meing my Ben has a crit
[00:25:08] rate of 40 something 43 or something and
[00:25:12] his crit damage is 130 like this is not
[00:25:15] like a gig stacked Bennett this is a
[00:25:18] very copium Bennett I have a lot of Em
[00:25:21] which isn't bad it's
[00:25:23] just feel oh wait yeah he doesn't even
[00:25:25] snapshot why did I do that
[00:25:29] imagine having benett
[00:25:33] sad last vide are Shang Ling C4 I
[00:25:35] already answered my uh
[00:25:38] constellations my uh my my fourstar
[00:25:41] characters have constellations my five
[00:25:42] stars usually don't and like most my
[00:25:44] four stars are C6 or at least like
[00:25:48] four just because I've uh I pull on new
[00:25:51] banners this okay this isn't doing too
[00:25:53] bad considering I'm very scuffed
[00:25:55] rotation here actually this is pretty
[00:25:56] bad but well it's not really actually
[00:25:58] there's only three enemies left and I
[00:26:00] don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing I
[00:26:01] don't know what I'm supposed to do here
[00:26:02] I just SMH my keyboard I'm going keep it
[00:26:05] real [ __ ] I thought he'd hit me that was
[00:26:08] so
[00:26:16] stupid is it worth playing for ficial
[00:26:19] constellations
[00:26:20] uh yeah but I it depends on the other
[00:26:23] characters in the banner FAL has good
[00:26:25] constellations I don't know what you def
[00:26:27] like it's hard for me to Define what's
[00:26:29] worth pulling for though cuz like it
[00:26:31] depends uh but they are good if that's
[00:26:33] what you're asking
[00:26:36] yeah dude I was so scared uploading my
[00:26:39] last video it did it did well and people
[00:26:41] liked it but like I was so [ __ ]
[00:26:43] scared that people would be like I can't
[00:26:44] believe you said this character is
[00:26:46] underrated they're so like they're
[00:26:48] either they're bad or they're not
[00:26:50] underrated I was I was scared cuz I
[00:26:53] don't know what the [ __ ] people think is
[00:26:54] underrated like I guess I was right but
[00:26:56] like it's very hard cuz I
[00:27:00] know what like
[00:27:03] general what like the majority of the
[00:27:06] YouTube audience thinks is good and bad
[00:27:08] but I don't like every individual has a
[00:27:09] different opinion so like if one person
[00:27:12] thinks it's not underrated then like
[00:27:13] they're going to be like wow
[00:27:18] misleading you did an overrated video
[00:27:20] people would be so pissed I was debating
[00:27:22] it but it would mainly be like two
[00:27:23] characters so I don't know if it's worth
[00:27:25] it
[00:27:44] where the two characters nope you're not
[00:27:47] hey nice try nice try to bait me into
[00:27:49] saying them that's not happening today
[00:27:52] that's not happening think I'm going to
[00:27:54] I'm going to say who's overrated upset
[00:27:56] all of chat
[00:28:05] nice bait nice
[00:28:09] try wait what did I just scuff whoa one
[00:28:12] sec I just scuffed something my OBS
[00:28:15] okay is it fine now Mona oh yeah we're
[00:28:19] fine we're fine I don't know what I
[00:28:20] scuffed but I fixed it we're
[00:28:24] okay shenan is over yeah yo I had this
[00:28:27] okay this was a shower thought I was
[00:28:29] thinking cuz I read a lot of comments
[00:28:31] being like where's shenan in my
[00:28:33] underrated video right I was
[00:28:36] thinking is shenan overrated because
[00:28:39] people think she's underrated that was
[00:28:42] my thought cuz like think about it if
[00:28:45] people think a character is over uh
[00:28:47] underrated but they're not then is is
[00:28:49] that character
[00:28:57] overrated this is a scuffed rotation but
[00:28:59] not bad damage not bad damage
[00:29:00] considering no I don't think so no one
[00:29:02] plays her yeah
[00:29:04] true true true
[00:29:07] true I mean she might be underrated but
[00:29:11] like yeah not really in a copium
[00:29:15] way she might be underrated in the sense
[00:29:18] that like she's not complete garbage
[00:29:20] she's just not optimal but like that's
[00:29:22] very copium that is like the most copium
[00:29:24] sentence I've ever said on Twitch and
[00:29:26] I've said many sentences on Twitch
[00:29:28] including something like flat defense is
[00:29:30] not that
[00:29:36] bad
[00:29:38] okay yo one sec my sounds are loud I
[00:29:41] can't give me a
[00:29:51] second oh dude he's getting knocked back
[00:29:53] into Africa dude no no no go back okay
[00:29:56] cool oh this is good actually not a bad
[00:29:59] clear hey first time TF benett not a bad
[00:30:02] clear I don't care what anyone
[00:30:11] says oh please don't die
[00:30:19] [Music]
[00:30:29] cool cool we're done what makes Chan
[00:30:31] lackluster it's just your scalings like
[00:30:34] cool design cool character like idea is
[00:30:36] just she doesn't do enough like there's
[00:30:39] always a better replacement
[00:30:46] basically but hey play her if you like
[00:30:48] her I'm not telling you not to play
[00:30:56] her B I think
[00:31:02] 140 you remember all those people saying
[00:31:04] BET's not viable cuz she has two too
[00:31:05] high of an energy cost I'm on
[00:31:26] 140 was better shine sh Ling C Shang
[00:31:29] Ling yeah I don't have to read the rest
[00:31:30] of your your
[00:31:32] sentence if you have Shang Ling C4 she's
[00:31:34] better
[00:31:35] than probably whatever character you're
[00:31:37] going to say next unless it's G or maybe
[00:31:41] sha um I still argue for Shia over but I
[00:31:45] know people disagree
[00:31:48] so that bot is cap what did the bot say
[00:31:51] Z has never died I have never
[00:31:54] died um all right we have to do wolf
[00:31:57] let's do wolf
[00:32:04] POG we are wolf
[00:32:07] [Music]
[00:32:14] doers one sec chat sorry just making
[00:32:17] sure my stre stream's not
[00:32:19] scuffed yeah we're good all right
[00:32:22] cool all right um yeah let's do wolf we
[00:32:27] can gambo too is Shang Ling good without
[00:32:29] child yes Shang Ling with uh shingu
[00:32:32] is uh better in single Target worse than
[00:32:34] AOE about as good overall in my opinion
[00:32:36] I know some people don't like child that
[00:32:38] much uh but I
[00:32:40] [Music]
[00:32:42] do Shang Ling just needs Bennett That's
[00:32:45] Her main uh downside in my opinion well
[00:32:47] an shingu she she has expensive team
[00:32:50] comps but the thing is like the
[00:32:52] alternatives are usually like the the
[00:32:56] thing is like her team are gen gen
[00:32:59] generally expensive but like the
[00:33:01] supports you would hm how do I explain
[00:33:04] this the other team comps where you
[00:33:06] would use those supports are usually
[00:33:07] just worse so it's not that big of a
[00:33:09] deal um but it's like why I like Ula
[00:33:13] over someone like duuke or something um
[00:33:17] because I like Ula because she doesn't
[00:33:19] steal your supports YULA runs diona and
[00:33:22] Fel and like Rosario or you know and
[00:33:26] those characters aren't very high High
[00:33:27] valued supports um usually like fal's
[00:33:31] really good but she's not using that
[00:33:32] many teams right she doesn't need like
[00:33:34] YULA doesn't need like shingu or or bet
[00:33:36] uh or
[00:33:38] Bennett yeah I need a better team for
[00:33:40] Wolf
[00:33:42] um who do I have geared other than like
[00:33:45] TF
[00:33:47] benett um you have duuke geared I want
[00:33:50] to play duuke I like love your YouTube
[00:33:54] vids nice welcome
[00:34:01] I don't know what that emote is uh kiwi
[00:34:03] but it is adorable they're AR considered
[00:34:06] support they're aren contested yeah
[00:34:07] exactly they're not contested like
[00:34:09] dona's good but she's not like like same
[00:34:12] with Fishel like you don't need fishal
[00:34:14] unless you're running like another
[00:34:15] physical carry or like B which I mean I
[00:34:18] guess B's really good
[00:34:20] but yeah anyways um let me gear this
[00:34:24] really fast
[00:34:27] [Music]
[00:34:47] kind of scuff but all
[00:34:51] right for du comp who do you want except
[00:34:53] shingu so duuk shingu and then um
[00:34:56] usually Bennett Flex the flex character
[00:34:59] like the best four star is usually
[00:35:01] sucros but a few like a lot of five
[00:35:03] stars are better um so like the last
[00:35:05] character would be like Jong Lee or
[00:35:07] venti or albo can work uh some people
[00:35:09] don't like albo cuz he can mess up your
[00:35:10] reaction sometimes um but for me it's
[00:35:14] been fine but I might just be lucky or
[00:35:16] C6 string true might help uh but yeah so
[00:35:18] last character is usually like strong Le
[00:35:20] vent ALB if you have a five star could
[00:35:22] also be Gan if you're not using Bennett
[00:35:25] uh but in terms of four stars it's
[00:35:26] usually duuk shingu
[00:35:28] Bennett or diona and then
[00:35:31] um who the [ __ ] is the last
[00:35:33] character uh sucros yeah also my shingu
[00:35:37] is not on sack sword for some reason so
[00:35:38] I don't have his burst up so I'm doing
[00:35:40] like zero
[00:35:42] damage Mona yeah Mona works too I forgot
[00:35:44] Mona existed imagine [ __ ] up the Hey
[00:35:47] My My My cool down was up all right
[00:35:49] chill I didn't have I have I don't have
[00:35:51] sa sword it's fine it's fine
[00:36:01] hope Kazo can be the flex in my Del sh
[00:36:03] Chu Bennett team hopefully Kazo looks
[00:36:10] sick I still don't know how I'm going to
[00:36:11] build kazawa I'm going to prep for him
[00:36:13] today we're going to spend our resin I
[00:36:15] don't [ __ ] know like if we're going
[00:36:17] to play him quick swap I'll need like
[00:36:19] one of the garbage sets like thunder so
[00:36:21] or lava Walker but if I farm for lava
[00:36:23] Walker and then I end up not playing him
[00:36:25] quick swap I might malt I
[00:36:28] might have a slight maling
[00:36:38] session never pre-farm no always
[00:36:42] prearm um
[00:36:45] like look I have a month of either the
[00:36:50] like for me at least maybe you guys
[00:36:53] shouldn't unless like you have Intel
[00:36:55] about what the character will need but
[00:36:58] like my Sha's only good because I well
[00:37:00] okay I want to not scuff them what's
[00:37:02] wrong with them oh yeah wrong feather my
[00:37:04] sh's only this good because I farmed for
[00:37:06] him for literally like 5 months before
[00:37:07] he came out cuz I knew sh was going to
[00:37:08] come out
[00:37:11] right so pre far for your broke yeah
[00:37:14] that's why I think like I wish I could
[00:37:17] talk about leaks like I wish mihoyo
[00:37:19] would just tell not have to leak would
[00:37:21] just tell us hey this character is going
[00:37:23] to need this [ __ ] Talent mat or talk
[00:37:26] to us a bit about what the [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:37:27] they do so I can free Farm an artifact
[00:37:29] set without having to guess anyways you
[00:37:32] guys have 30 seconds to vote on if we're
[00:37:35] going to get a dream
[00:37:38] solvent 30 seconds POG bet all your
[00:37:45] [Music]
[00:37:48] points yeah yeah no I was talking about
[00:37:50] myself like I need to prearm but yeah
[00:37:55] anyways G you also doesn't steal shingu
[00:37:58] and
[00:37:59] Bennett uh G honestly needs good
[00:38:03] supports cuz if you run well she doesn't
[00:38:05] like G is broken just alone but
[00:38:08] like yeah yeah g is pretty nuts but like
[00:38:11] her best teams have high value supports
[00:38:12] Right freeze wants venty Mona although I
[00:38:14] guess Mona is not high
[00:38:16] value but yeah venty is uh and then
[00:38:19] second team like if you're running her
[00:38:20] melt you need Shang Ling Ben it and then
[00:38:21] if you're running her just no reactions
[00:38:23] then yeah run whatever you
[00:38:26] want all right
[00:38:28] Chad what do you think I'm thinking
[00:38:29] dream solvent and two of the
[00:38:30] strawberries watch this and a glad piece
[00:38:33] I'm feeling lucky okay
[00:38:36] solvent okay never mind oh we got two
[00:38:42] strawberries
[00:38:45] sad very
[00:38:47] sadge [ __ ] believing
[00:38:50] yeah it's a doubter
[00:38:53] stream it's cuz we had to Luke out we
[00:38:56] should have swapped
[00:38:58] all right chat good
[00:39:00] news good news chat I have five resins
[00:39:04] of the condensed variety cuz I didn't uh
[00:39:06] play genjin
[00:39:10] Yesterday imagine calling any boss mat
[00:39:12] other than butt plug yeah true they
[00:39:14] literally all are like okay we're not
[00:39:16] going to analyze this too much but like
[00:39:19] this is a butt plug this is a butt plug
[00:39:22] if you're creative this is a butt plug
[00:39:24] arguably a butt plug I don't know what
[00:39:26] this is
[00:39:27] maybe definitely like that's a lot and
[00:39:30] this is a
[00:39:33] [Music]
[00:39:34] tail why do you use gems to refresh when
[00:39:36] you have fragile I save my fragiles uh I
[00:39:38] think they're more valuable in case a
[00:39:39] new character comes out or a new
[00:39:40] artifact set or something that I'm not
[00:39:42] ready for I just crack these
[00:39:45] open or like if I'm about to end stream
[00:39:48] we have no content then like someone
[00:39:50] like raids me or like I'm like [ __ ] we
[00:39:52] got to do this boom pop the faggies
[00:39:59] Pepe W what the [ __ ] is Pepe
[00:40:02] W wait what am I doing with my resin
[00:40:05] uh let me think about it we'll go kill
[00:40:07] the Run guards I think about
[00:40:12] it frile resid like Last Hope yeah I
[00:40:14] usually like saving around 10 I have
[00:40:16] like 25 now though um I was saving my
[00:40:20] fragiles
[00:40:22] for uh for pale flame but then I got
[00:40:25] pale flame pretty fast so
[00:40:29] yeah nightbot timed out code get [ __ ]
[00:40:32] okay I got to fix my
[00:40:34] nightbot I'm
[00:40:36] sorry uh what the [ __ ] is this it's not
[00:40:44] bad I like how you're right here cuz
[00:40:46] nobody uses
[00:40:51] it uh do we want Pepe W what even is it
[00:40:55] when do you use Pepe w
[00:41:05] okay
[00:41:05] sure add a GRE no I [ __ ] hate AG GRE
[00:41:09] holy [ __ ] I was watching slice's stream
[00:41:11] I was like man this is a good stream and
[00:41:12] then he said agre and the whole chat
[00:41:15] spam this and I started I maled I hate
[00:41:18] agre dude I I he looks so
[00:41:25] dumb agre just so
[00:41:28] bad we could add ZF
[00:41:32] [Music]
[00:41:35] oopsy um yeah so I might do lava Walker
[00:41:39] if I want to run quick swap kazua if
[00:41:41] that's even a thing in which case I
[00:41:43] should probably get four lava Walker but
[00:41:45] I don't think I know myself I don't
[00:41:48] like comps where it's like hey this is
[00:41:50] only going to work if you ventti Al and
[00:41:52] then benit Infuse your swirl with pyro
[00:41:55] and then all the enemies inside get
[00:41:56] infused with pyro and if you miss a
[00:41:58] single enemy you're brain dead and
[00:41:59] shouldn't play the team I don't like
[00:42:01] those teams so realistically am I going
[00:42:03] to run a kazua lava Walker maybe who
[00:42:06] knows but I don't know if it's worth
[00:42:08] like pre-
[00:42:16] farming and it's the same reasoning as
[00:42:18] with uh sha it's an anemo character who
[00:42:21] doesn't have a good anemo set so they
[00:42:23] might need uh like one of the other sets
[00:42:26] right before Shia came out if you guys
[00:42:28] were here I was farming thunder so
[00:42:30] because I was like okay he's going to
[00:42:31] come out he's either going to need two
[00:42:32] vescent two glad or another set like
[00:42:35] thunder sother like lava Walker like
[00:42:36] blizzard Strayer because he doesn't have
[00:42:37] a good set turns out the problem with
[00:42:39] sha is his Al gives him so much damage
[00:42:41] percent that something like thunder is
[00:42:43] worse than just glad because of attack
[00:42:45] percent being better but if there's a
[00:42:47] new anemo character that doesn't have a
[00:42:48] ton of attack damage percent then they
[00:42:52] might want one of those sets
[00:42:58] just run lava Walker
[00:43:01] aaka
[00:43:03] um yeah
[00:43:05] no I don't want lava Walker
[00:43:08] dude we might have to do it let me do my
[00:43:10] talent books first diligence or what's
[00:43:12] the other one pause
[00:43:15] [ __ ] that's not bad let's do that
[00:43:21] [Music]
[00:43:29] all right lesson in being a mod chat you
[00:43:31] guys get educated on being a mod in a uh
[00:43:34] moderate twitch stream okay we're not
[00:43:36] big but we're not tiny so we actually
[00:43:38] have people talking so we're going to
[00:43:40] I'm going to give you guys a lesson
[00:43:41] being a
[00:43:42] mod I'm pretty diligent I'm nice to
[00:43:45] people all right you see you see someone
[00:43:47] like lol xddd typing M Omega l d and k w
[00:43:51] whenever I die that's okay it gives
[00:43:53] flavor but when you see someone like uh
[00:43:57] I am streaming but nobody watches me so
[00:43:59] I am watching this can somebody watch My
[00:44:01] Stream I don't you don't need to be here
[00:44:04] you're wasting the oxygen of this chat
[00:44:07] room boom rolled I'm sorry I I feel bad
[00:44:11] for you but also don't self-promote it's
[00:44:16] cringe I don't mean anything like I'm
[00:44:19] sure you're a cool person I'm sure if we
[00:44:21] talked we'd be like friends you know
[00:44:23] we'd be homies but yeah don't
[00:44:25] self-promote unless you're code code can
[00:44:27] self
[00:44:28] promote time zones are weird wait what I
[00:44:32] misread
[00:44:33] that oh yeah no people get um you get
[00:44:37] different Talent books per server well
[00:44:39] not how do I explain yeah okay I'm going
[00:44:41] to move on cuz this was not the common I
[00:44:43] thought it
[00:44:44] was song of broken Pine is good for
[00:44:46] support bet not really it's kind of
[00:44:48] copium I wouldn't use
[00:44:52] it cuz like the stat is wasted but is it
[00:44:55] better than some alternative I don't
[00:44:57] know I haven't mathed [ __ ] Pines for
[00:45:00] support beta but it doesn't look that

[00:52:48] worst piece um so yeah I could get a
[00:52:51] better feather from vescent I don't
[00:52:52] really have that good one like this

[00:53:16] it Nick you're my favorite streamer
[00:53:19] you're my favorite viewer
[00:53:20] Smile
[00:53:23] Smile you're all my favorite viewers
[00:53:25] anyone that
[00:53:27] I
[00:53:30] so if you hear this you're my favorite
[00:53:32] viewer I want you to know this that
[00:53:35] right now the 1,021 people here
[00:53:37] currently you are all my favorite
[00:53:39] viewers so anyone else in the future
[00:53:42] that joins I might like them I might
[00:53:44] love them I might hate them but they
[00:53:46] won't be as favorite as you thousand
[00:53:50] right now that's all you need to know
[00:54:03] all right I dude I haven't done this
[00:54:04] domain in so long I [ __ ] I hate this
[00:54:07] domain I mean it's not that bad but if
[00:54:08] it goes wrong it goes like [ __ ]
[00:54:16] terrible I was here
[00:54:24] smile oh dude don't die okay
[00:54:33] [ __ ] just joined what happened nothing
[00:54:36] it's a secret okay chat should I check
[00:54:39] all my artifacts at once I think we just
[00:54:41] okay I think here's the plan I'm going
[00:54:43] to explain this again I think if we
[00:54:45] check an artifact we're just going to be
[00:54:47] depressed every time right let's say we
[00:54:48] check 10 artifacts if nine out of 10 are
[00:54:50] bad we're going to be sad 9 out of 10
[00:54:51] times so what we're going to do is we're
[00:54:53] going to accumulate wealth okay we're
[00:54:55] going to be like a rich capitalist
[00:54:58] individual we're going to accumulate all
[00:54:59] our wealth and then at the end we're
[00:55:01] going to check all the artifacts and we
[00:55:02] do a big Gamba so I'll check these uh
[00:55:04] after like we'll do FL
[00:55:07] forx flow tips
[00:55:10] for thank you for the flower in the 100
[00:55:14] bits no no it it's actually big brain
[00:55:16] like this is it it's it's better for
[00:55:19] your mental health right cuz think about
[00:55:21] it if you just check every run you're
[00:55:24] probably going to be sad 95% of the time
[00:55:28] but wait does the pillar make them not
[00:55:31] whatever but if you check once after 10
[00:55:35] 20 runs then you might be like happy
[00:55:38] like okay how do I explain this the odds
[00:55:40] of you being happy are much higher than
[00:55:42] if you were to just check everyone
[00:55:43] individually you know then instead of

[01:03:48] anyways chat I was thinking tomorrow we
[01:03:51] should check these artifacts soon by the
[01:03:52] way what up Matha I was thinking
[01:03:54] tomorrow well I was thinking of doing it
[01:03:55] today but I didn't but I was think
[01:03:57] tomorrow
[01:04:00] like all right one
[01:04:03] sec uh one sec let me let me jabate the
[01:04:07] jator one sec so someone asked me quote
[01:04:11] do you like ride on to that I say ride
[01:04:14] on this dick get rolled you were going
[01:04:15] to try to roll me you probably have the
[01:04:17] message typed out you probably have haha
[01:04:19] ride on this dick Lau XD right you
[01:04:22] probably have that ready you just got
[01:04:23] rolled I'm sorry see you you can no
[01:04:25] longer show your face here because
[01:04:27] you're too embarrassed I feel bad for
[01:04:30] you now tell me what your thoughts on
[01:04:32] Gulpin
[01:04:34] are but anyways uh what was I going to
[01:04:37] say yeah I was going to do like so my
[01:04:40] plan was initially like okay stream
[01:04:42] genin and then after like 4 hours or
[01:04:43] whatever when I'm out of content variety
[01:04:46] but I feel like I always just never do
[01:04:48] cuz it gets too late so I could five
[01:04:51] head just randomly stream during the day
[01:04:53] whatever I'm doing like OverWatch or
[01:04:55] some game Hades Pokemon valerant who
[01:04:58] knows and then at night do a gen stream
[01:05:00] so I could do it separate if I don't
[01:05:02] feel like doing one long one so I might
[01:05:04] do
[01:05:05] that uh yeah I kind of want to level
[01:05:09] like a new account on OverWatch so if I
[01:05:11] do that I'll probably just stream it cuz
[01:05:13] might as well I'll just be Chill
[01:05:19] Vibes also to let me warm up again dude
[01:05:22] I have my sense recently I literally
[01:05:23] have my well not have but minus point I
[01:05:28] like quartered I whatever almost half my
[01:05:31] sense so I have to get used to new
[01:05:35] sensitivity cuz it was it was good but
[01:05:37] like it was good for what I played and I
[01:05:40] want to be able to play more will you do
[01:05:42] a CLE guide yes I'm going to borrow my
[01:05:43] friend's account who has CLE literally
[01:05:46] tomorrow start testing CLE stuff but I
[01:05:48] already know like artifacts and weapons
[01:05:50] and [ __ ] so it's mainly just borrowing
[01:05:52] it to to test like animation cancelling
[01:05:54] and stuff cuz she's been out for for so
[01:05:55] long that like all the math has already
[01:05:57] been done on her
[01:06:03] right not pulling for Cle I might but
[01:06:06] the guide will be out before like I'll
[01:06:08] record I'll make the guide before the
[01:06:10] rerun right uh cuz like we already know
[01:06:14] everything about CLE like nothing new is
[01:06:15] coming it's it's the same
[01:06:17] character YouTube stream no it it just
[01:06:19] be two twitch streams probably okay
[01:06:21] here's the plan
[01:06:26] uh actually are you guys interested in
[01:06:27] that like so I was like I'll probably
[01:06:30] still do like variety after genjin after
[01:06:32] like 4 hours or whatever if I want to
[01:06:35] but like should I okay so if I'm doing
[01:06:38] I'm not going to look at chat yet
[01:06:39] because I don't want to be biased but or
[01:06:41] influence but if I'm just vibing and
[01:06:44] it's not going to be like a full formal
[01:06:45] stream if I just want to do like 1 hour
[01:06:47] or two hours of some random game or like
[01:06:48] OverWatch or something should I stream
[01:06:51] it separately and then like still do
[01:06:53] gench at night or do you guys rather
[01:06:55] just
[01:06:56] I mean I guess there's no downside so I
[01:06:58] don't know why I'm asking it but yeah
[01:07:00] anyways get boa I will let's do the
[01:07:02] Gamba first um well we can get uh Goa so
[01:07:06] we're going to do nobless versus
[01:07:07] bloodstained I don't know why I'm
[01:07:09] farming this I'm going to be honest but
[01:07:10] we have one 2 3 4 5 six no bless and
[01:07:13] that's what we want versus how many
[01:07:15] Blood
[01:07:16] Stained Blood
[01:07:20] Stained 1 two 3 4 5 6 seven eight so a
[01:07:23] bit better odds we're going to do a
[01:07:24] Gamba
[01:07:28] we're going to do a Gamba chat you have
[01:07:29] one minute to vote biggest Gamba of the
[01:07:32] stream what will have better
[01:07:36] artifact yep noblis
[01:07:39] nope blood stain stain of
[01:07:43] hemoglobin all right let me go get boba
[01:07:47] one
[01:07:49] [Music]
[01:07:52] sec oh also I've been trying to think
[01:07:55] who who's who's like my top four
[01:07:57] supports I've been trying to order them
[01:07:59] cuz it's obviously Jang Le ventti
[01:08:00] Bennett shingu right it's pretty clear
[01:08:02] jangi ventti benett shingu but I've been
[01:08:04] trying to order them and it's really
[01:08:06] hard cuz there's so many arguments for
[01:08:07] every character that like even someone
[01:08:10] like shingu who usually I'd put like the
[01:08:12] fourth um you can argue that he enables
[01:08:15] pyro characters and a lot of pyro
[01:08:16] characters are only good because of him
[01:08:18] so it's hard for like so there's like
[01:08:20] yeah it's very hard but
[01:08:24] anyways is that Boba yeah he's a giant
[01:08:26] Boba plushy say hi chat we're bringing
[01:08:29] him for good artifact
[01:08:33] luck uh let me
[01:08:40] hydrate okay here's what we're going to
[01:08:42] do we're going to check blood stain
[01:08:45] first and then no bless and then after
[01:08:48] that we'll see what's better uh
[01:08:50] hopefully Nu blast cuz I don't like
[01:08:52] doubters winning so yeah boom okay
[01:08:57] feather okay who the [ __ ] okay I'm gonna
[01:09:00] all right chat I've been on my thing as
[01:09:03] open join requests cuz I felt like you
[01:09:05] guys were respectful however clearly I
[01:09:09] need to change it now you might be
[01:09:10] asking Z you probably don't even know
[01:09:12] how to change it true true but if I
[01:09:14] didn't know how to change it then would
[01:09:16] I know that it's right here okay that
[01:09:19] it's right in the other section okay no
[01:09:22] would I know that it's in the co-op
[01:09:26] watch this look at this five head
[01:09:28] play reject join requests actually
[01:09:32] rolled literally I'm going to accept
[01:09:35] them just to say rolled oh actually
[01:09:38] demolished get oh dude actually
[01:09:41] demolished okay anyways back back to
[01:09:43] Blood
[01:09:44] Stained back to Blood Stained okay Blood
[01:09:47] Stained where's
[01:09:50] blood I'm nothing nothing against
[01:09:53] whoever tried to join I'm sure you're a
[01:09:54] wonderful IND indidual okay
[01:09:58] boom dude how long has it been since
[01:10:00] we've gotone in a crit circl like
[01:10:02] actually how many
[01:10:03] streams flower not bad crit damage not
[01:10:07] bad
[01:10:09] Sans albo Sans hey
[01:10:13] albo
[01:10:14] yeah oh
[01:10:17] uh this is good hey say what you want
[01:10:20] crit rate ER on physical actually not
[01:10:22] bad now granted I already we have
[01:10:26] this but this is looking like the best
[01:10:29] artifact so bad uh so far so not
[01:10:33] bad okay yeah okay but doubters have one
[01:10:36] artifact if you're a doubter this is
[01:10:38] your Saving Grace this is your Holy
[01:10:41] Goblet chalice whatever this is yeah
[01:10:46] okay boom
[01:10:48] noblis okay here's the prediction this
[01:10:51] gobbl is going to be
[01:10:52] bad but this one's going to be amazing
[01:10:54] watch this this is going to be HP oh
[01:10:57] yeah we already saw this this one's
[01:10:58] going to be Hydro damage okay this is
[01:11:01] actually not bad though for like J Lee
[01:11:04] or like Bennett not bad
[01:11:07] feather hey three good stats High Rolls
[01:11:10] we like that we like that uh crit rate
[01:11:14] no crit
[01:11:21] okay okay I mean not bad I mean hey crit
[01:11:27] damage okay here's what I'm gonna
[01:11:30] do here's what I'm gonna
[01:11:33] do if this feather gets crit
[01:11:36] damage Believers win if not I think the
[01:11:40] golet's better cuz a physical goblet on
[01:11:42] blood stain is pretty good with a crit
[01:11:44] stat so we're going to level the feather
[01:11:46] to plus four if it gets crit damage we
[01:11:49] give it to Believers if it doesn't we
[01:11:51] give it to doubters all
[01:11:54] right the those are the terms and
[01:11:56] conditions that you've accepted copium
[01:11:58] so hard I mean a four stat hey if this
[01:12:00] has scw damage is actually really good
[01:12:01] though cuz it's nobl with only good
[01:12:02] stats so there's a chance I guess we'll
[01:12:06] just get it to
[01:12:12] four oh
[01:12:17] okay oh dude
[01:12:21] um all right well
[01:12:25] I'm sorry if you're a Believer I I love
[01:12:27] you I truly do
[01:12:29] but bua didn't come in clutch
[01:12:37] today yeah okay
[01:12:41] well there you go I think doubters have
[01:12:43] won every gambo today do I have any how
[01:12:46] did I refresh once yeah I only refresh
[01:12:48] once well refresh two more boom we can
[01:12:50] do more uh domains but I don't want to
[01:12:51] do no blast anymore we can do another
[01:12:53] Gamba but we'll do it lava Walker cuz I
[01:12:55] want to prep this just in
[01:12:57] case or

[01:13:38] like YULA I'm tired of tired of being a
[01:13:41] meta

[01:14:47] [ __ ] cracked but my only bloodstain
[01:14:48] Sands is this one and it missed well it
[01:14:50] got er which actually isn't
[01:14:52] bad honestly okay no cap this is this
[01:14:55] isn't even copium No Cap if this hits
[01:14:57] crit damage or ER we are
[01:15:01] cuming okay dude this is winnable if you
[01:15:06] think this isn't winnable you're
[01:15:11] trolling okay uh
[01:15:16] yeah I
[01:15:19] [Music]
[01:15:21] mean okay
[01:15:37] okay yeah this is this is dog
[01:15:39] [ __ ] uh I will just run an ER SS
[01:15:42] actually cuz I don't want to have to
[01:15:44] like you only need like 20 or like 30 ER
[01:15:47] or 40 on her but I don't have any ER sub
[01:15:50] stats so I'm just going to run a [ __ ]
[01:15:51] ER sense I don't care uh that being said
[01:15:54] we need a ciret let's run this one
[01:15:57] what's my
[01:15:58] ratio okay um now see the thing is this
[01:16:02] is like one to two Okay you know how one
[01:16:04] to two is like Optimal this is this is
[01:16:06] one to two now you might be thinking Z
[01:16:09] run a crit damage ciret well the thing
[01:16:11] is my crit damage ciret has bad sub stat
[01:16:13] actually has
[01:16:15] ER which
[01:16:17] means if I run a Sans that has some
[01:16:21] ER but I don't
[01:16:25] yeah my 's my my Sands don't really have
[01:16:30] [Music]
[01:16:35] ER level that physical blood stain
[01:16:37] goblet bro look at what I am using there
[01:16:40] is no way there's literally a 0% chance
[01:16:44] zero that this oh wait that this ends up
[01:16:49] better there's literally no way you have
[01:16:51] a less attack what's my attack oh
[01:16:55] um oh no I'm on attack stand now wait
[01:16:58] what am I without
[01:17:00] it okay what if we run wolves we can
[01:17:02] just run
[01:17:04] Wolves yeah there you go 2K and then if
[01:17:07] I put attack
[01:17:09] Sands 2500 and then if we don't put
[01:17:11] attack Sands cuz we're not little
[01:17:13] [ __ ] actually cuz I don't have good
[01:17:15] enough ER Subs boom 21 and then we have

[01:18:06] her uh we're going to run Jean cuz she's
[01:18:09] cool and suddenly we got a team we got a
[01:18:12] [ __ ] team on our hands boys

[01:18:58] crit rate
[01:19:04] [Music]
[01:19:11] ciret yo that song was kind of hype no
[01:19:13] cap I wasn't really paying attention and

[01:19:17] ever just make noises when you don't
[01:19:18] know what to say or am I weird
[01:19:21] anyways okay hey you got to give crit
[01:19:24] rate to your team that's not bad
[01:19:26] genuinely genuinely press one if I'm
[01:19:28] being genuine you got to give crit rate
[01:19:30] to your team on Rosaria hey that's true
[01:19:34] that's true we could also run her with
[01:19:36] staff of hom and then suddenly anyone
[01:19:39] that typed copium looks like a fool with
[01:19:42] this perfect 1 to five ratio
[01:19:46] wow okay uh yeah we'll just run DM and
[01:19:50] we can run
[01:19:52] maybe I mean
[01:19:56] like I can do
[01:19:58] this like this is hey this is pretty
[01:20:02] good do you do PS4 reviews uh no but you
[01:20:05] can submit an imer link which is just a
[01:20:06] picture of your PS4 account so I could

[01:20:13] can't do this anymore are

[01:20:30] I not supposed to I don't know what
[01:20:33] domains are anymore dude I haven't
[01:20:35] [ __ ] done a domain that isn't like
[01:20:37] vescent in a while I don't even know
[01:20:39] what I've been doing actually oh
[01:20:43] my okay maybe we're not okay all right
[01:20:47] okay maybe we're not playing YULA all
[01:20:49] right chat I'm sure there's like three
[01:20:51] or four Ula fans in chat that were
[01:20:53] exciting to see some Ula Gam game play I
[01:20:56] don't know if that's possible anymore
[01:20:57] I'm going keep it real maybe maybe on
[01:20:59] tomorrow's stream or we can just you
[01:21:02] know what what if we just what if we
[01:21:03] just do lava Walker today I said we do
[01:21:05] Thunder Fury what if we
[01:21:07] don't actually no I want to do Thunder
[01:21:09] Fury I don't know we might do both we'll
[01:21:13] see not YULA but Rosaria pepega yeah but
[01:21:17] Ula also applies cryo right her e does
[01:21:20] and then her Q does and then her e does
[01:21:23] again just put Jong Le in the
[01:21:28] team we could or we could play Shia
[01:21:36] [Music]
[01:21:39] smile play her she's gorgeous yeah but
[01:21:42] have you seen Shia look I I agree YULA
[01:21:46] is very uh well-designed she's she's
[01:21:49] beautiful right but come
[01:21:51] on come on that's all I have to say just
[01:21:54] OB effectively I you can't compete with
[01:21:56] Shia I'm sorry respectfully like okay
[01:22:01] respectfully I don't
[01:22:07] know also my jungly is on uh [ __ ]
[01:22:10] favonius Lance for some reason probably
[01:22:12] change
[01:22:14] that can anyone compete with Shia uh I
[01:22:18] mean have you seen Jong Lee with like
[01:22:21] Chinese voice acting too I don't know
[01:22:23] kind of
[01:22:37] kind of makes me feel a certain way poo
[01:22:40] kill me okay all right chat watch this
[01:22:43] this is going to be the best artifact
[01:22:44] we've ever seen or your money back if
[01:22:46] this isn't the best
[01:22:48] artifact I will
[01:22:50] refund actually I'm not going to refund
[01:22:52] anything you'll get scammed but I
[01:22:54] guarantee best artifact watch
[01:22:56] this watch we meteored the
[01:22:59] tree wow
[01:23:03] insane okay all right
[01:23:08] F she C1 sha worth it it's good but I
[01:23:11] don't know if it's worth it like it
[01:23:12] depends on your definition it's not
[01:23:13] needed but it's pretty
[01:23:19] good TR viable is free to play yeah he's
[01:23:21] uh hyper carries are pretty good for
[01:23:23] free to play cuz hyper cares mean you
[01:23:25] don't have to invest that much in your
[01:23:26] supports so like you invest a lot in
[01:23:29] Shia and you get to his damage cealing
[01:23:30] very or like you know good damage pretty
[01:23:33] fast whereas a lot of
[01:23:35] characters you might need to invest into
[01:23:37] like their whole team right
[01:23:56] like with tri teams yeah I mean any
[01:23:57] Shang Ling team any like even like bet
[01:24:01] teams like you can just invest in beta
[01:24:02] if you want but you know shingu and and
[01:24:04] fishell both want investment too like a
[01:24:06] lot of a lot of like the teams that
[01:24:07] synergize with each other need a lot of
[01:24:10] investment whereas hyper carries don't
[01:24:13] so like YULA YULA is very freetop play
[01:24:15] friendly in my in my mind cuz you only
[01:24:17] invest in
[01:24:18] her uh and her supports are't expensive
[01:24:21] and they're all all her supports are
[01:24:22] like free to play or like we're giv for
[01:24:24] free in past
[01:24:26] events oh my okay D all we're
[01:24:34] cursed coun riew
[01:24:38] FG what is it called down
[01:24:43] bad
[01:24:51] uh okay
[01:24:54] kind of a sus kind of a sus account
[01:24:57] review I'm going keep it
[01:24:59] real Foster check yeah sure kind of a
[01:25:02] sus account
[01:25:03] review um
[01:25:06] because your main your pyro okay your
[01:25:09] DPS are all pyro like Hut Yan Fe Shang
[01:25:14] Ling so it's yeah but you have Razer you
[01:25:17] have bet you have ning Wong you have
[01:25:20] options uh
[01:25:25] parametric Transformer true I should do
[01:25:27] that okay uh I'll make you a [ __ ]
[01:25:30] Pyro Team first so if you're running you
[01:25:32] can run Hut or Shang Ling it's up to you
[01:25:34] judging by the fact that your Hut's
[01:25:35] level 80 and your weapons Homa level 80
[01:25:38] will make you a Hut team so Hut shingu
[01:25:40] Kaa and then flex but since you don't
[01:25:42] have J Le is probably a Healer so
[01:25:44] probably like diona do you have diona
[01:25:46] you do so probably this is your first
[01:25:49] team very good team should be able to
[01:25:51] clear Abyss uh second team it depends
[01:25:54] you can run you yeah you can't really
[01:25:57] run Shang Ling cuz you're using uh
[01:25:59] shingu with Hut but you can run B you
[01:26:03] could run Razer you could run uh y well
[01:26:06] overload yon I guess or you could run
[01:26:08] ning Wong it's up to you judging by the
[01:26:11] fact that you have a ning Wong level 70
[01:26:14] and a whith level 80 r five I assume you
[01:26:18] like ning Wong so I'm going to make you
[01:26:20] a ning Wong team that being
[01:26:23] said uh that's not me saying ning Wong
[01:26:25] is the best option here like again you
[01:26:27] could make a bet team you could make a
[01:26:28] Razer team whatever but I'm just going
[01:26:29] to make you a ning Wong one uh so you
[01:26:31] can run ning Wong with any good off
[01:26:32] field supports uh I would recommend
[01:26:34] using with j or ALB if you had them you
[01:26:36] don't you could run with MC though I
[01:26:38] think uh ning Wong with MC is actually
[01:26:39] pretty good no cap I really like it you
[01:26:41] don't have Bennett which kind of
[01:26:43] sucks actually yeah everything I said
[01:26:46] about changling doesn't really apply I
[01:26:48] don't like Shang without Bennett
[01:26:49] honestly
[01:26:52] um but Razer and ning Wong don't need
[01:26:55] Bennett who's your other healer
[01:26:58] Barbara oh
[01:27:00] yeah yeah so I would just do
[01:27:09] um yeah I mean this isn't this isn't
[01:27:11] even that copium it's fine it's it's
[01:27:13] genuinely fine you just run ning Wong
[01:27:15] with a Geo goom MC who are actually good
[01:27:17] together you get Geo residence you get
[01:27:19] uh Geo battery because of traveler uh
[01:27:22] and if you can utilize her C two I
[01:27:24] believe if she gets a lot better uh and
[01:27:26] then on top of that you just run FAL as
[01:27:27] an off field support and then you stick
[01:27:29] a Healer there who's probably Barbara
[01:27:30] put your Barbara on thrilling tals is it
[01:27:32] a copium team yes but will it work yes
[01:27:35] what if I go with the Razer or B uh just
[01:27:38] I mean if you're running a Razer
[01:27:41] team Razer would be
[01:27:45] here where's
[01:27:47] Razer Razer or bet would be here uh I
[01:27:51] can't find them though
[01:27:54] and then you'd run a a a super conduct
[01:27:56] and a Healer so ideally diona or like
[01:27:59] rosari or something since you don't have
[01:28:01] any cryo users other than these two I'd
[01:28:03] probably put diona on this team diona or
[01:28:05] Kaa one of the two and then the last
[01:28:07] character is just a flex support so
[01:28:11] like yeah you could even Mona if you
[01:28:13] well you don't have a pirate of
[01:28:15] Vape yeah [ __ ] someone just any Flex
[01:28:17] support but
[01:28:19] anyways
[01:28:21] uh I would do the what I said the Ning
[01:28:24] wrong
[01:28:27] team do I did your cat ears technique
[01:28:30] what do you mean cat ears
[01:28:31] technique [ __ ] does that mean I don't
[01:28:33] have a cat ears technique
[01:28:37] oh never mind I do I just
[01:28:41] realized look I I say a lot of stuff
[01:28:44] okay so when people quote me on things I
[01:28:46] say I usually don't
[01:28:49] remember but yes I'm glad the uh the the
[01:28:52] strategy worked for you the fact that
[01:28:53] you said those words that I will not
[01:28:55] repeat do not didn't change the outcome
[01:28:58] I'm sure that was just
[01:29:00] fluke but I'm glad it worked for
[01:29:06] you three dream solvents Jesus Christ I
[01:29:09] got I think well I think I got two
[01:29:11] actually that's not bad
[01:29:13] congrats still waiting for cat your
[01:29:16] stream I a we said it would be post

[01:33:29] employee and he said very good thank you
[01:33:32] Nicholas I was like all right well you
[01:33:34] didn't have to call me by my government
[01:33:35] after I said those words but all right
[01:33:38] it's fine I'll get over
[01:33:45] it man he called me my government
[01:33:50] dude actually a very nice dude though
[01:33:53] but yeah I
[01:34:00] anyways okay chat No Cap I've kind of
[01:34:03] been Dono Walling Mi hoyo now do you
[01:34:07] guys so I don't I don't do um I don't do
[01:34:11] sponsored stuff usually I know I can I
[01:34:13] know nobody gives a [ __ ] but I usually
[01:34:14] don't okay except Razer cuz I like Razer
[01:34:17] but do you guys think I should do a do
[01:34:20] you guys think I should do a honai
[01:34:21] stream or is the game Trash I don't know
[01:34:23] the game I genuinely don't what do you
[01:34:24] guys think should I do it or should I
[01:34:27] not not like regardless of money I'm
[01:34:30] just talking about the game like I don't
[01:34:31] give a [ __ ] about the money I'm not here
[01:34:33] for money I'm just saying should I
[01:34:35] like cuz there's there's a thing where
[01:34:37] there's like kaching and fishell
[01:34:40] right there's a lot of yeses but also a
[01:34:42] lot of NOS it's like a 50/50 there's
[01:34:44] like yes and there's like trash it's
[01:34:46] like it's
[01:34:49] very yeah there's yes and there's no
[01:34:51] trash I don't know
[01:34:55] it's
[01:34:56] all we'll see we'll
[01:34:59] see it's fun but gets repetitive yeah
[01:35:01] but if it's like a 2hour stream it's
[01:35:03] just testing the
[01:35:05] game we'll see we'll
[01:35:07] see I'm not against
[01:35:12] it but hey if there's endgame content in
[01:35:16] honai that we discover that'll make
[01:35:18] that'll be like hopeful for the future
[01:35:21] of genin right cuz what do we need we
[01:35:23] need Co-op op endgame content actually
[01:35:25] did I do the survey yet I think there's
[01:35:27] a survey I didn't do if we get endgame
[01:35:28] Co-op content this game is goated
[01:35:31] genuinely as soon as we get repeatable
[01:35:33] endgame content Co-op that is difficult
[01:35:37] but fun oh that's a bro I will literally
[01:35:41] okay you know how I ate a sock on stream
[01:35:44] I will eat a [ __ ] on stream if they I
[01:35:46] I'm not don't I'm not saying that if I
[01:35:47] finished that sentence it would have
[01:35:48] gotten clipped but if they give us
[01:35:52] repeatable endgame C Co-op content
[01:35:54] that's like nuzen cost resin oh dude oh
[01:35:58] it's over we win genin goed s
[01:36:03] game don't clip it I didn't say
[01:36:06] that I didn't finish my sentence if I
[01:36:08] finish my sentence you would have been
[01:36:10] able to clip it but since I tactically
[01:36:12] cut my sentence you can no longer go
[01:36:14] back I apologize I apologize
[01:36:26] can you repeat what you said
[01:36:30] no sorry bro but I'm late and I walk
[01:36:33] into you saying all right I didn't say
[01:36:35] that it was a figure of speech it was an
[01:36:39] exaggeration a hyperbole if you will the
[01:36:42] exact opposite of a
[01:36:49] euphemism I I didn't that didn't I was
[01:36:51] not sad
[01:36:55] [Music]
[01:36:56] either way it's not like we're going to
[01:36:57] get co-op endgame content there's no
[01:37:04] way look I was thinking of what would
[01:37:07] rhyme with sock okay and it was the only
[01:37:09] word I could come up with granted if I
[01:37:11] spent more time thinking about it maybe
[01:37:13] I could have had a better sentence maybe
[01:37:16] like we'll eat a you know will throw a
[01:37:20] rock
[01:37:21] will uh
[01:37:26] invest in stocks you know like I could
[01:37:28] have thought of something but that's
[01:37:30] what we
[01:37:32] found hey look I I'm going to be real if
[01:37:35] Mi hoyo is listening or
[01:37:39] anyone that oh [ __ ] wait this is good we
[01:37:42] need a t oh this actually good okay POG
[01:37:45] um no
[01:37:49] cap what was I going to say
[01:37:53] what was I going to say oh yeah if
[01:37:55] anyone like okay if me saying
[01:37:58] that brings negative consequences to me
[01:38:02] in order for mihoyo to give us endgame
[01:38:04] content then it will be worth it if my
[01:38:06] reputation becomes tainted right they're
[01:38:08] like oh sock when are you you promised
[01:38:11] but you didn't
[01:38:13] deliver if that happens but we get
[01:38:16] endgame content then it's for the
[01:38:17] greater good
[01:38:40] [Music]
[01:38:43] Chad how do I advertise TF Bennett if it
[01:38:46] if if I if I end up using it I like
[01:38:49] we'll call it the strongest team you've
[01:38:50] never heard of but like it's it's Bas
[01:38:54] like it's dude the DPS of like if you
[01:38:57] play it optimally in like Alexi's comp
[01:39:00] calculator which is just an Excel
[01:39:02] spreadsheet it's [ __ ] similar to G
[01:39:05] and people like there's no way for me to
[01:39:08] tell people that it's that good without
[01:39:12] employing like I don't know how to get
[01:39:14] that message across it's very difficult
[01:39:17] but also I don't know if that's true yet
[01:39:18] like I have to test
[01:39:21] it clickbait all the away yeah no I
[01:39:24] don't I don't want
[01:39:25] to there like then nothing
[01:39:27] differentiates me from the YouTubers
[01:39:29] that are like wow how did mihoyo let
[01:39:31] this happen c0o freeo Play Broken insane
[01:39:34] how is this okay th those I don't want
[01:39:36] to be there I like being in the Middle
[01:39:38] where it's like damn I want to click on
[01:39:40] this without it being cancerous that's
[01:39:42] what I
[01:39:44] [Music]
[01:39:48] want it's good but actually reaching the
[01:39:50] ceiling is
[01:39:52] copium yeah yeah true and it's hard to
[01:39:54] play very uh well at least for me I
[01:39:57] might just be dumb but it is hard to
[01:40:02] play I think freeze helps or messes up
[01:40:04] huta shingu it helps huta shingu Kaaya
[01:40:07] is usually the core uh for that team
[01:40:09] it's very good uh so adding freeze
[01:40:11] messes up uh deluke or characters that
[01:40:14] can shatter so Claymore um and I CLE
[01:40:16] shatters too but I don't uh I still
[01:40:18] tally but anyways like uh freeze will
[01:40:21] mess up Delo cuz you don't want to
[01:40:22] shatter but Hut does doesn't chatter if
[01:40:24] she uses her spear like a pyro attack on
[01:40:27] a Frozen character it'll melt so Ka just
[01:40:30] adds bonus damage you forgot to put
[01:40:32] Philippines yeah yeah we got to change
[01:40:34] the title we we put Philippines in the
[01:40:36] title so we get all the viewers we put
[01:40:39] uh c0o we put freeo play we put broken
[01:40:42] and we put uh we put corp's husband we
[01:40:45] got everyone
[01:40:47] clicking Rosaria new skin boom get all
[01:40:51] the viewers
[01:40:53] and we we'll start with the Majestic
[01:40:56] intro there you go we'll start with that
[01:40:58] and we'll put like in the thumbnail
[01:41:00] we'll put like new skin leaked free
[01:41:04] akaka patch
[01:41:08] 1.1 oh I can't
[01:41:10] s seeing the violin as the intro I
[01:41:14] should make a [ __ ] post video that would
[01:41:16] be funny I should do
[01:41:19] [Music]
[01:41:21] that shout you skin will bring in
[01:41:24] viewers honestly yeah that's like it's
[01:41:26] not a bad uh it's not a bad call okay
[01:41:28] let me level the artifacts we
[01:41:31] got um where are the TF
[01:41:35] [Music]
[01:41:38] ones can't believe chat convinced me to
[01:41:41] to face cam today I wasn't going to and
[01:41:42] then I was like you know what [ __ ]
[01:41:45] it we're going to have a booba vtuber
[01:41:48] okay if we get crit damage I will be
[01:41:51] very happy
[01:41:53] but I don't think we
[01:41:56] will s uh this could still be good
[01:41:59] though and this is not a copium
[01:42:01] statement this it could still be
[01:42:11] good where's my shirtless taraga oh [ __ ]
[01:42:14] one sec my voice died okay uh I have a
[01:42:18] there's a so there's a mod only channel
[01:42:20] on my Discord called tartaglia shirtless
[01:42:22] because
[01:42:24] unfortunately uh it's mod only so I
[01:42:29] apologize seems it doesn't matter where
[01:42:31] I go to watch streamer Matt's always a
[01:42:32] meme I mean yeah the dude's a living
[01:42:37] meme hydration I got
[01:42:44] you okay what are we
[01:42:46] doing why is that a thing I I don't know
[01:42:49] why not
[01:42:51] [Music]
[01:42:56] uh what was my plan I forgot let me try
[01:42:59] Okay let me try one thing really
[01:43:01] [Music]
[01:43:14] [Music]
[01:43:18] fast um B Bennett official who's the
[01:43:22] last character sh
[01:43:23] true and
[01:43:32] then how's he not ban he talks about so
[01:43:34] much leaks yeah I don't mind people
[01:43:36] talking about leaks but I don't well I I
[01:43:38] can't but I don't mind it I I really
[01:43:40] don't care I just don't like monetizing
[01:43:42] it I find it unethical but maybe that's
[01:43:45] just my [ __ ] the law studed inside of
[01:43:48] me I just feel like it's weird to like
[01:43:50] data mine and then monetize it like if
[01:43:52] you're leaking so that people
[01:43:53] know what like I don't know I don't like
[01:43:56] I don't care if you leak [ __ ] I really
[01:43:57] don't and like I don't I genuinely could
[01:44:00] not give less of a [ __ ] it's just weird
[01:44:02] to make your living out of that I just
[01:44:04] find it weird why are these guys vibing
[01:44:06] they're not
[01:44:08] teleporting but I don't I don't have a
[01:44:10] strong stance on it like I might be
[01:44:12] wrong I'm very like I it's hard cuz when
[01:44:15] I like if I'm streaming and I have some
[01:44:20] form of influence on what people think I
[01:44:23] like giving my opinion when I know what
[01:44:25] my opinion is but sometimes I just don't
[01:44:27] know like what my position should be on
[01:44:30] stuff so I try to approach it with
[01:44:32] caution but I just I yeah I don't like
[01:44:34] the idea of
[01:44:35] like like yeah just monetizing leaks
[01:44:40] like I don't
[01:44:45] know opinion no right or wrong yeah but
[01:44:47] I feel like people are influenced by
[01:44:49] opinions of people they watch very
[01:44:51] heavily um
[01:44:53] and my opinion like if I say something
[01:44:56] like shenan is broken and then people
[01:44:59] invest into shenan and then they're like
[01:45:01] damn Z made me waste all my resources on
[01:45:03] shenya and I hate him and then it it it
[01:45:06] hurts me and it also hurts them right
[01:45:08] and so if I'm saying like if I'm saying
[01:45:10] something like man I hate this person
[01:45:12] and then that person gets a bunch of
[01:45:14] hate because of me and especially if
[01:45:17] it's an opinion that I'm not sure if I
[01:45:19] have or not it's very iffy although
[01:45:22] either way I love everyone like I don't
[01:45:27] care
[01:45:28] um but
[01:45:31] yeah M about that too yeah I don't like
[01:45:33] the way Alexi talks
[01:45:36] about uh that stuff I I don't like it
[01:45:39] and I love Alexi I'm probably his
[01:45:41] biggest friend uh biggest fan but a lot
[01:45:43] of the thing like I don't like taking
[01:45:45] the moral High Ground And the main thing
[01:45:47] is like a big thing he's against is like
[01:45:49] encouraging whaling which I'm against as
[01:45:51] well but like at the same time it's not
[01:45:53] a streamer's job to be like the [ __ ]
[01:45:57] like never spend your money like not
[01:45:59] everyone has to be like that any it
[01:46:00] doesn't matter this none of this matters
[01:46:02] you love us yes I love all of you
[01:46:04] especially you Mr code yeah but
[01:46:06] genuinely like I I like like I I I like
[01:46:09] being friends with everyone like I think
[01:46:10] people are I think I see the best in
[01:46:13] like I think people are good inherently
[01:46:15] so I try not to not like people uh and
[01:46:18] there's not many people I dislike like
[01:46:20] of all the YouTubers I think there's
[01:46:23] one that annoys me but he's not big
[01:46:28] anyway so it doesn't matter King snow
[01:46:29] thanks for the three
[01:46:31] months appreciate you who I'm not saying
[01:46:34] it it's not that's not happening I'm
[01:46:36] sorry you can try to get me to say it
[01:46:38] but it's not
[01:46:39] happening cuz it doesn't matter there's
[01:46:41] no benefit of me being like I dislike
[01:46:44] this person unless the only benefit is
[01:46:46] me correcting misinformation that is
[01:46:47] important like if someone's making like
[01:46:51] like um if someone says bad [ __ ] about a
[01:46:54] character that isn't true I should
[01:46:55] correct it right
[01:46:59] yeah techy I said a smaller all right I
[01:47:03] literally said small how the [ __ ] is
[01:47:05] teone small he literally has 10 times my
[01:47:08] audience if that at minimum 10 times
[01:47:10] like I okay maybe not 10 but you know
[01:47:13] what I
[01:47:19] mean okay this is a terrible clear guys
[01:47:22] I'm sorry I don't know what I'm
[01:47:33] doing it's not the size that matters are
[01:47:37] you talking about content creators
[01:47:40] or okay guys stop guessing stop but it
[01:47:43] isn't Tony I like Tony I I don't the
[01:47:46] thing is apparently Tony includes
[01:47:48] disclaimers like hey this is just I okay
[01:47:51] here's the thing with Tony I like Tony I
[01:47:53] love I find his videos funny but I hate
[01:47:55] people's reaction to the videos I hate
[01:47:58] that it has an impact cuz he doesn't
[01:47:59] even want it to has an impact he
[01:48:01] literally puts a disclaimer in Chinese
[01:48:02] according to ten0 who I trust he
[01:48:04] literally puts a disclaimer in Chinese
[01:48:06] that this isn't this is just like whale
[01:48:08] damage it's just a showcase and people
[01:48:10] still are like wow did you see the
[01:48:12] damage he did I need YULA I hate the
[01:48:15] response that his videos get but that
[01:48:17] doesn't mean I dislike his videos I
[01:48:18] think he's fine I think everything he
[01:48:20] does is cool and entertaining but but
[01:48:23] like I don't like the the response it
[01:48:26] gets that's
[01:48:32] all oh yeah shingu doesn't snapshot I
[01:48:35] don't know why I always shingu burst uh
[01:48:36] like inside of venets it's just like
[01:48:38] force of habit but I don't have
[01:48:41] to 36k what else 10 30k Again sh Wait
[01:48:46] I'm not hting okay what else Mr Bennett
[01:48:51] boom okay I need to get some particles
[01:48:53] maybe a little bit of
[01:48:56] [Music]
[01:49:00] particles for the extra D damage yeah
[01:49:12] true I need to farm some particles
[01:49:14] before this ends it might be too late
[01:49:17] now uh okay yeah it was too late
[01:49:20] T oh [ __ ]
[01:49:27] chat I have been recording for an hour
[01:49:29] and 30 minutes because I wanted to
[01:49:32] record one Abyss clear oh my dude my I
[01:49:36] got okay let me delete
[01:49:40] it all
[01:49:47] right dude okay my videos don't look
[01:49:50] edited right like I try my best to make
[01:49:52] my seem like fluid look at how many
[01:49:55] [ __ ] dude look at how much I have to
[01:49:56] record for one video that was one of my
[01:49:58] shorter videos all of this is me
[01:50:02] talking all of this is DPS footage bro
[01:50:06] well maybe okay this isn't but like most
[01:50:07] of it it took I don't know why it takes
[01:50:09] me so many [ __ ] Clips to make one
[01:50:12] video but anyways doesn't
[01:50:14] matter I think I'm more picky with what
[01:50:16] I include though
[01:50:19] like yeah feel like genon should lower
[01:50:22] their prices yeah I agree although
[01:50:24] sadly capitalism woo it's not going to
[01:50:27] happen but I agree the rates are bad
[01:50:30] however uh not to defend mihoyo but
[01:50:32] rates are terrible they should be better
[01:50:35] however at least the game is very
[01:50:36] free-to-play friendly and force our
[01:50:38] characters are very good but that being
[01:50:40] said yes I
[01:50:44] agree just do everything for his try
[01:50:46] it's more that like I need to clear
[01:50:47] content like 100 times because like if I
[01:50:51] clear in 20 seconds okay I get 20 second
[01:50:53] of footage but like it's a 15minute
[01:50:56] video where I'm talking over DPS Clips
[01:50:58] so like I need to clear so much [ __ ]
[01:50:59] with so many
[01:51:01] comps played games with worse rates a
[01:51:03] sad I've never played a gacha game
[01:51:05] before so
[01:51:10] yeah what is your voice on dead in every
[01:51:12] vid
[01:51:14] uh YouTube voice I don't know dude you
[01:51:17] guys know my I I had like bro have you
[01:51:19] guys heard my old YouTube videos I don't
[01:51:21] know why my voice is deep like maybe I
[01:51:23] recorded after I woke up or
[01:51:26] like bro look at my so I don't even have
[01:51:28] that many videos right like I'm I'm but
[01:51:31] if you looked at my first one tell me
[01:51:33] this okay tell me if this actually
[01:51:35] sounds like me it doesn't wait he what's
[01:51:38] up guys I'm quickly going to make a
[01:51:39] review on the verison hunt which is the
[01:51:41] battle pass boat like
[01:51:43] what okay like later I get I talk a bit
[01:51:46] more like swap kill everything that's
[01:51:48] pulled in and then by the time you yeah
[01:51:50] I uh I think it was like when I woke up
[01:51:52] or maybe um my voice is when I'm talking
[01:51:58] fast like this my voice is more high
[01:52:00] pitched than if I just slow down and I
[01:52:01] think for this video I was like all
[01:52:02] right because I never made a video
[01:52:04] before so I was just like talking as
[01:52:06] though I had to talk whereas now I'm
[01:52:08] just like vibing so maybe what's what do
[01:52:10] I sound in a new
[01:52:12] video and it'll give you back two to
[01:52:14] yeah yeah it's it's literally night and
[01:52:17] day literally night and day
[01:52:22] was that your
[01:52:31] dad okay uh I don't have Bennett burst
[01:52:33] yet which is quite a
[01:52:36] sagger someone should make sagger into
[01:52:38] an emote I find sagger sounds cool like
[01:52:41] I don't know what it would be maybe like
[01:52:42] a sad Badger like a sagge with a badger
[01:52:46] and then it's a sagger oh my dude hire
[01:52:48] me Twitch right now put a contract on me
[01:52:51] bro holy
[01:52:57] we make a sad Badger call it
[01:53:00] sagger how is that haha okay I'm
[01:53:08] done okay this is the worst we don't
[01:53:10] talk about this
[01:53:16] oh did you guys see it do you guys see
[01:53:19] something oh I'm so I'm malding how did
[01:53:22] we clear that fast bro my DPS is on a
[01:53:25] level one
[01:53:26] weapon that's like a betal comp right
[01:53:29] she's literally on a level one weapon
[01:53:33] I'm done okay I'm
[01:53:37] molding okay
[01:53:39] [Music]
[01:53:42] uh I didn't
[01:53:44] know okay well there you go that makes
[01:53:48] sense uh we should probably level our
[01:53:50] Talons more never mind
[01:53:57] [Music]
[01:54:04] what was I going to
[01:54:05] do oh yeah sorry all right
[01:54:10] boom should you ever consider making em
[01:54:12] beta with tartaglia no uh unless 1.6
[01:54:15] changes this the scaling like the the
[01:54:18] damage of electrocharged isn't much so
[01:54:20] even in electrocharged teams
[01:54:22] it's a nice bonus damage but it's not
[01:54:25] enough to build em uh on your beta so
[01:54:29] that's why rain slasher isn't as good as
[01:54:31] it seems in like uh in those teams like
[01:54:34] it could be a viable option but it's not
[01:54:37] like yeah actually it's not even I think
[01:54:39] it's worth worse than
[01:54:41] archaic according to Mr
[01:54:44] zanto okay uh boom boom boom and then
[01:54:48] Jean and then here we put shingu all
[01:54:51] right easy clap
[01:54:55] but yeah this is probably like if I were
[01:54:56] to make a VD on this and I don't know if
[01:54:58] I will I would 1 million per call this
[01:55:01] the strongest team you've never heard of
[01:55:03] cuz
[01:55:04] literally nobody has ever [ __ ] played
[01:55:06] TF Bennett if you did congrats I owe you
[01:55:08] an ice
[01:55:10] cream if you're ever in the supermarket
[01:55:13] and you see me and you're like Z you owe
[01:55:15] me an ice cream I play TF benett I will
[01:55:17] buy you
[01:55:19] one how do you play Mona uh I don't have
[01:55:22] her but two Hydro set two no blast use
[01:55:26] your uh Bennett burst and then Mona
[01:55:28] burst and then Bennett e so like you
[01:55:30] have to like double Vape from my
[01:55:31] understanding you have to like use it on
[01:55:33] pyro and then pyro it anyways I I don't
[01:55:35] have her so I'm not
[01:55:38] [Music]
[01:55:49] sure uh what am I what's the order is
[01:55:51] that to wa I'm supposed to e on shingu
[01:55:55] that and then that and then perfect
[01:55:57] Parry wow such a good streamer boom look
[01:56:00] at this damage okay Sho what else okay
[01:56:04] what else Bennett okay not critting
[01:56:06] that's fine 30k okay I still didn't crit
[01:56:08] okay my benett didn't crit a single time
[01:56:10] guys I have not crit
[01:56:12] once I will
[01:56:14] crit
[01:56:18] bro okay running back
[01:56:24] run it back run back we're going to get
[01:56:25] it we're going to get
[01:56:26] it we're going to crit this time let me
[01:56:28] wait for my serent spine to stack
[01:56:30] up oh by the way if you guys use serpent
[01:56:33] spine make sure your serent spine user
[01:56:34] is on one in Abyss cuz the stacks will
[01:56:36] stack up while you're just chilling five
[01:56:40] head we played L who was your main uh
[01:56:42] kha'zix and Gangplank okay we're going
[01:56:45] to go here
[01:57:00] okay look at this crit okay wait look at
[01:57:03] this crit though okay okay 30k Bennett
[01:57:06] what else sh what else Bennett tell him
[01:57:10] okay
[01:57:11] Bennett how do you do so much
[01:57:15] damage bet you feel dumb for ditching
[01:57:17] him now Roy yeah little [ __ ]
[01:57:23] okay actually pretty good actually fast
[01:57:27] clear actually fast clear no
[01:57:32] cap do you guys want to
[01:57:35] see after this let me show you my Ben
[01:57:38] ratio okay whatever you think my Bennett
[01:57:40] ratio is it is lower I just want you
[01:57:42] guys to know that whatever you think my
[01:57:44] artifacts on Bennett are they're
[01:57:47] worse like my benett is ultra
[01:57:51] undergeared
[01:58:00] like someone wrote 55 110 I genuinely
[01:58:03] think it's worse than that I'm not even
[01:58:05] capping I literally think it's worse
[01:58:07] than 5110 but we'll
[01:58:13] see oh [ __ ] I should have caught the
[01:58:14] particles on sh although it doesn't
[01:58:16] matter we're just going to just BR force
[01:58:18] it dude it's so bad it's mainly a bet
[01:58:22] pum well it's bet and Bennett but beta's
[01:58:25] broken
[01:58:31] so 5110 is actually
[01:58:34] good chicken 65 roll do you care to
[01:58:38] explain that statement 5110 is good okay
[01:58:42] all right I don't I'm not a flexer I've
[01:58:44] never flexed on stream before but like
[01:58:53] this is what we usually deal with on
[01:58:55] this stream okay this
[01:58:59] 5110 is the most copium of
[01:59:02] copium 2 99.6
[01:59:08] okay okay now what
[01:59:12] anyways
[01:59:18] wait okay I didn't no wonder he wasn't
[01:59:21] critting oh my my God what am I doing
[01:59:25] dude call me step bro cuz I don't know
[01:59:27] what I'm doing what the [ __ ] is that
[01:59:29] okay I think my ciret is wrong I don't
[01:59:31] know what the [ __ ] okay wait wait what's
[01:59:33] my best Critter ciret uh probably this
[01:59:37] one it's on Jean but I want to [ __ ] my
[01:59:40] Jean that sound's not
[01:59:43] bad
[01:59:46] okay yeah this is my ratio 45 112 like
[01:59:50] it's not good it's just we have 400 Em
[01:59:53] which is also
[01:59:56] good why are you guys PA
[01:59:59] going can you explain to us why you
[02:00:01] don't put some constellations on your
[02:00:03] characters oh just cuz I don't want to
[02:00:04] be called like like I'm fine with having
[02:00:07] whale artifacts but I don't want to have
[02:00:08] like a C6 sh or like there's no point in
[02:00:12] getting constellations it just makes
[02:00:13] people be
[02:00:15] like Z only likes this character cuz
[02:00:18] he's C6 I I kind of try to not have
[02:00:20] constellations on five stars maybe C1
[02:00:22] sometimes activate like I have child C1
[02:00:24] I have sh C1 but
[02:00:26] yeah that's main why uh okay what was I
[02:00:30] going to
[02:00:31] [Music]
[02:00:34] do what was I going to do oh yeah yeah
[02:00:38] Bennett okay how do I make my Bennett
[02:00:40] better let let's be real here like this
[02:00:42] feather is pretty good but like I'm
[02:00:45] pretty sure crit is better than em and
[02:00:48] so we might want to try to get more crit
[02:00:55] somehow if this guy crit
[02:00:58] damage I will gift one
[02:01:02] sub I will gift one
[02:01:05] sub if this gu CR damage if it every
[02:01:07] time it rolls crit damage after that
[02:01:09] I'll give another sub and if it only
[02:01:10] rolls crit damage I'll give 1000 million
[02:01:13] but that's not going to happen so it
[02:01:14] doesn't
[02:01:16] matter okay all right cool nice uh there
[02:01:20] might be another feather we didn't see
[02:01:21] though
[02:01:22] maybe uh actually there's none okay um
[02:01:27] [Music]
[02:01:28] huh okay
[02:01:32] [Music]
[02:01:35] um at least the song uh is slapping you
[02:01:38] know it's a pretty good song now my
[02:01:40] question is chat my question is what if
[02:01:43] I do something known in the industry as
[02:01:45] a circlet swap and then we put a goblet
[02:01:48] that is pyro but with crit rate wow and
[02:01:53] now suddenly the
[02:01:54] ratio that's pretty good that's hey we
[02:01:57] don't crit often but when we do we hit
[02:01:59] hard now what if I
[02:02:01] run no black sword's too copium dude do
[02:02:04] I really want to level a [ __ ] black
[02:02:05] sword to 90 I don't
[02:02:08] know uh if we get a crit rate ciret
[02:02:12] which I don't think I have on TF
[02:02:14] [Music]
[02:02:26] okay call me crazy call me high on
[02:02:30] copium
[02:02:31] [Music]
[02:02:34] but arguably oh [ __ ] arguably better
[02:02:38] arguably better now is it good no but is
[02:02:41] it better
[02:02:54] okay we're going to go do we're going to
[02:02:55] do more domains we're going to do more
[02:02:56] domains you I usually don't do refreshes
[02:02:58] past this so I'm going to use I'm going
[02:02:59] to do one fragile and one bonus refresh
[02:03:03] because I didn't stream in two days so I
[02:03:04] saved my gems cuz I didn't refresh when
[02:03:06] I didn't Stream So you get a bonus so
[02:03:08] now this is like me giving you guys more
[02:03:10] content cuz I missed two streams
[02:03:12] easy you don't give them their own
[02:03:14] artifacts it's hard I have too many
[02:03:15] characters I play so I I swap artifacts
[02:03:17] between characters um but yeah like I I
[02:03:23] like B fishal and sometimes TF H sorry
[02:03:26] sometimes venet all want thundering Fury
[02:03:29] so like it's hard for me to have that
[02:03:30] many Thunder Fury
[02:03:35] [Music]
[02:03:38] pieces oh yeah [ __ ] I'm still on the
[02:03:40] attack goblet oops
[02:03:44] [Music]
[02:03:51] two refreshes only last five minutes
[02:03:53] actually
[02:03:58] true you know what we'll do a Gamba chat
[02:04:01] you guys can this is going to be the
[02:04:03] best Gamba in history we're going to
[02:04:06] Gamba if with this whole 135 resin okay
[02:04:10] divide that by 20 it gives you a number
[02:04:12] I know what it is but I don't want to
[02:04:13] say it because now it's been so long
[02:04:15] that if I say six you'll think it took
[02:04:16] me this long to calculate it but we're
[02:04:19] going to do all this resin in thundering
[02:04:20] Fury the question the Gamba is simple
[02:04:24] will we get will streamer get one good
[02:04:29] artifact that's all will we get one good
[02:04:31] artifact you might be thinking what is
[02:04:33] good I don't know we'll decide later yep
[02:04:36] good nope should not have
[02:04:45] rolled okay chat since good and should
[02:04:47] rhyme we're using no should but then in
[02:04:50] parenthesis it explains anyways all
[02:04:52] right boom you guys have 2 minutes to
[02:04:56] vote we'll check all the artifacts at
[02:04:58] the
[02:04:59] end believing is a scam true
[02:05:06] sag why do this guy's not get knocked
[02:05:08] back the
[02:05:11] [Music]
[02:05:12] [ __ ] he's in Dev mode dude I wish I
[02:05:15] haven't gotten good artifacts in actual
[02:05:20] years what does stringless have string
[02:05:22] good
[02:05:27] [Music]
[02:05:29] question why
[02:05:32] do oatmeal cookies have raisins who
[02:05:36] knows the world's out to get us chat at
[02:05:39] least we have each
[02:05:48] other when you play on your free to play
[02:05:50] usually at the start of the Stream if I
[02:05:51] want to today I didn't really feel like
[02:05:53] it cuz I didn't know what to do on it um
[02:05:55] but I'm not against
[02:06:09] [Music]
[02:06:13] it by the way if ever have to like
[02:06:15] cancel the stream or announce anything
[02:06:18] it will be posted in my Discord I'm
[02:06:20] trying to be more better at announcing
[02:06:22] before it's late cuz like yesterday I
[02:06:24] couldn't stream cuz of sadist so if
[02:06:25] you're not in you should join uh oh
[02:06:32] no it's fine it's not rigged it's not
[02:06:35] rigged it's not rigged it's okay it's
[02:06:38] not rigged it's one artifact it's one
[02:06:40] artifact we'll do another we'll do
[02:06:42] another we won't we won't but it's fine
[02:06:44] it's one artifact now Believers think
[02:06:47] they're going to like they're not going
[02:06:49] to win right however little do Believers
[02:06:52] know that like now they're going to win
[02:06:55] more because there's more doubters which
[02:06:56] means Believers will win even more
[02:07:01] wow your sh is double crowned only yeah
[02:07:04] yeah I might Crown the e but it's kind
[02:07:06] of a
[02:07:08] waste y want to see something cool no
[02:07:11] cuz it's probably not cool but
[02:07:20] yes change language honestly I
[02:07:26] should you emote what the [ __ ] is
[02:07:29] that that is not okay you can't say want
[02:07:32] to see something cool and then post
[02:07:34] whatever the [ __ ] that is not hey it's a
[02:07:37] good emote but it's like I would not
[02:07:39] describe that as cool I would describe
[02:07:40] that as do you want to see something
[02:07:43] cursed and potentially frightening
[02:07:46] horrifying it is good though I like it
[02:07:51] blurst no it's not blessed in no world
[02:07:54] is that
[02:08:00] blurst why do you go behind the tree
[02:08:02] better artifacts
[02:08:23] I need to probably get more emotes I
[02:08:24] want to commission an artist for more
[02:08:26] otes but I also want to uh I need a new
[02:08:27] YouTube picture and I also need um
[02:08:30] [ __ ] I need new sub badges for cuz I
[02:08:33] actually have been streaming for a while
[02:08:34] now which is POG which means I need sub
[02:08:36] badges for like six months and a year
[02:08:38] and [ __ ] so we might have like a triny a
[02:08:40] shiny trap inch and like a Flygon or
[02:08:42] something so yeah
[02:08:52] yeah anyways I'm
[02:08:54] vibing your new video is great no you're
[02:08:58] great but yeah I think I cracked the the
[02:09:02] the what people want to see
[02:09:05] formula other than just normal character
[02:09:07] guides videos like
[02:09:09] that that uh are
[02:09:13] very complete as to like everyone can
[02:09:16] use them and that look clickable like
[02:09:19] that art like not clickbait but that are
[02:09:22] like you know something that applies to
[02:09:24] everyone so it's like uh uh the same
[02:09:26] sort of title format as like a a gacha
[02:09:29] gamer video except it's me making it so
[02:09:31] the information in it will be good right
[02:09:34] for the most part so that it's like five
[02:09:38] head stuff but like made to look
[02:09:41] mainstream which means we're like the
[02:09:43] Gateway from average mobile Andy to
[02:09:47] Theory crafting boom easy right

[02:20:45] pity dude I've been building artifact
[02:20:47] pity for like literally 10 streams in a
[02:20:49] row like the only good artifact we've
[02:20:52] gotten in the recent streams unless I'm
[02:20:53] forgetting something which I don't think
[02:20:55] I am I think the only good artifact is
[02:20:57] this one and it's all em like it's not
[02:21:00] even crit so it's like a copium good
[02:21:03] artifact but it's fine this is where our
[02:21:05] lock changes
[02:21:20] don't change your username no no no just
[02:21:22] be profile picture I'm not going to the
[02:21:24] only username I might change is Twitch
[02:21:26] to just Z without the X's cuz my brother
[02:21:28] has that but I'd have to contact twitch
[02:21:30] for
[02:21:35] it okay

[02:21:59] twitch and if I do it's like at this
[02:22:01] point do I want to change my twitch name

[02:26:18] know he wasn't so could he going be
[02:26:20] higher and my and my bet is not on a
[02:26:23] bless my bet is on TF so like this isn't
[02:26:25] I could probably e 100K genuinely I'm
[02:26:28] not capping I think I could e 100K cuz
[02:26:31] my he could be in in uh in
[02:26:33] TF this could be
[02:26:35] sucrose I could even level my talent if
[02:26:37] I want to and I can probably run more
[02:26:40] crit D oh no I can't I can't run more
[02:26:41] crit damage okay wait
[02:26:44] chat chat this might have been a fluke

[02:26:52] fluke let me go to no blast real
[02:26:56] [Music]
[02:27:00] quick I don't want to scuff my artifacts

[02:27:06] much did venty serve any purpose there
[02:27:09] what did venty do he just clumped

[02:27:18] um I need a goblet that doesn't have HP
[02:27:20] on any stat okay there you
[02:27:23] go I need a circlet that doesn't have HP

[02:27:54] witness you guys are about to witness
[02:28:14] history actually uh ge resonance is
[02:28:17] probably worse than pyro resonance right
[02:28:19] cuz uh sh wants attack more than he
[02:28:21] wants damage
[02:28:23] percent I'd
[02:28:26] assume I don't actually know whatever
[02:28:29] we'll just give her we'll just we'll use
[02:28:30] the

[02:33:45] to see what I can do uh this should be
[02:33:48] fine too
[02:33:52] no okay we're going [ __ ]
[02:33:54] [Music]
[02:33:57] it all right chat here goes
[02:34:01] nothing okay well I don't have my 308 on
[02:34:03] cool down but it would have killed them
[02:34:05] just know it would have killed him okay
[02:34:07] if it wasn't on cool down he would have
[02:34:08] died it would have been height but it's
[02:34:11] on cool down
[02:34:12] [Music]
[02:34:20] uh
[02:34:21] okay why alt because alt gives you
[02:34:24] damage percent right unless I'm stupid I
[02:34:27] don't really read
[02:34:29] talents but Al should give me damage
[02:34:31] percent right under the effects of B all
[02:34:34] all evil all damage dealt by sh
[02:34:36] increases by
[02:34:41] 5% doesn't enhance the e oh well there
[02:34:44] you
[02:34:46] go Shia main did not know
[02:34:51] well actually I it should enhance the E
[02:34:53] it says all damage I don't see why it
[02:34:54] wouldn't if it doesn't then it's ridden
[02:34:56] poorly so I just assume it does until
[02:34:57] proven
[02:35:01] otherwise I meant my character I yeah I
[02:35:04] mean yeah I know but it's fine it's fine
[02:35:06] SE I'm just
[02:35:07] vibing it does yeah yeah I'm not stupid
[02:35:10] I doubt myself too much for someone
[02:35:11] who's played [ __ ] six years of Sha
[02:35:16] [Music]
[02:35:20] but I want to see it
[02:35:27] uh I mean we
[02:35:31] can
[02:35:33] oh okay don't talk about Bennett it's
[02:35:35] fine Bennett's fine he's
[02:35:41] fine Bennett doesn't count Bennett
[02:35:43] doesn't count it's not a death Bennett
[02:35:45] he's chilling don't worry about him
[02:35:47] Bennett doesn't count
[02:35:54] do the coop all right sea get
[02:35:58] on we can try
[02:36:01] it you also need Mona yeah Mona does
[02:36:04] give damage true I don't yeah I don't
[02:36:07] have her also Cy 2 would be much better
[02:36:09] than yon Fe like much much
[02:36:12] better but cy2 is like the the whale the
[02:36:15] secret whale damage
[02:36:19] [Music]
[02:36:22] I'll just use yon J Le and then you do
[02:36:24] the
[02:36:29] rest I don't know what my most damage is
[02:36:31] though I I feel like two glad is is is
[02:36:34] cool but I probably substats over like
[02:36:35] this might actually be my best uh cuz if
[02:36:38] I don't care about crit rate then I
[02:36:41] literally filter by crit damage and I
[02:36:42] take all the highest ones
[02:36:44] now luckily or unluckily depending on
[02:36:47] how you see it
[02:36:50] actually this is better if I don't care
[02:36:52] about crit rate I do this and then
[02:36:53] suddenly yes my ratio is worse but I
[02:36:56] have more attack percent now see I'm at
[02:36:58] 2,600 attack sock says Auto reject on oh
[02:37:02] [ __ ] my bad yeah people were joining
[02:37:05] earlier
[02:37:08] uh I'm
[02:37:10] [Music]
[02:37:14] stupid all right I got it
[02:37:19] [Music]
[02:37:32] chat kill the
[02:37:33] CLE C4 gen and what probably Bennett
[02:37:38] [Music]
[02:37:40] right probably Jean Bennett there's no
[02:37:43] reason there's no way Bennett isn't
[02:37:45] unless I'm running Bennett
[02:37:50] the question is well is is G is Cy 2
[02:37:53] better than J Lee probably but do we
[02:37:55] want to run the setup of setting up cy2
[02:37:57] I don't know maybe we
[02:38:00] could like J well actually no that's not
[02:38:02] true J Le well I could run Bennett
[02:38:04] actually never mind I have Bennett I
[02:38:05] forgot I have
[02:38:14] Bennett have crowned
[02:38:16] Mona I genuinely cuz Mona's nice cuz she
[02:38:19] has uh thrilling Tales too right you
[02:38:21] can't give me thrilling tals
[02:38:24] though same with
[02:38:34] [Music]
[02:38:36] CLE okay we can try you and Bennett
[02:38:38] jeene we can swap later what do you want
[02:38:39] to what do you want to fight against we
[02:38:40] can do like uh we can do the the
[02:38:43] something probably that's close to
[02:38:44] teleport right maybe a
[02:38:46] plant or we could do vop we go plant if
[02:38:50] we kill the plant we'll go Bishop
[02:38:52] actually this is my world this plant's
[02:38:53] probably dead Omega LOL it's fine we can
[02:39:01] wait oh my music's kind of loud I didn't
[02:39:03] turn it back
[02:39:05] down okay chat I believe do you

[02:39:12] believe in the content we have Sea by
[02:39:15] our side okay I need to get all charge
[02:39:16] though
[02:39:24] also I have no er um also no crit rate
[02:39:27] cuz I give myself Max crit damage well I
[02:39:30] still have like 55 crit rate or
[02:39:31] something but you know relatively no
[02:39:34] crit
[02:39:34] rate okay I'm ready whenever I have Al

[02:46:42] yeah I uh there's a lot of underrated
[02:46:44] characters I was I was always scared
[02:46:47] because I was really scared to upload it
[02:46:48] because I didn't know what people
[02:46:50] considered underrated and like everyone
[02:46:52] has a different
[02:46:53] definition of what's
[02:46:58] underrated why is there a capital D
[02:46:59] colon what did I say oh yeah but
[02:47:03] like yeah like every character is just
[02:47:06] super slept
[02:47:07] on I just feel bad for everyone that was
[02:47:10] expecting me to say uh like talk about
[02:47:12] Shang Ling and then they watch it and
[02:47:14] they're like wait a second where is
[02:47:15] Shang Ling and then I don't have the
[02:47:17] heart to tell them uh not sorry I talk
[02:47:19] about Shang everyone that expected
[02:47:20] shenan and I didn't have the heart to
[02:47:22] tell them like all right I'm sorry I'm
[02:47:25] sorry okay even Mr code even okay code
[02:47:29] himself has stated in this very chat
[02:47:32] room you know
[02:47:39] copium isn't code like the biggest uh
[02:47:43] physical damage hater in the world he
[02:47:45] went from Ming shenan to hating physical
[02:47:47] this is what shenan does to to a man sag
[02:47:50] who's overrated Hut who else I'm not
[02:47:53] going to say but there's quite a few
[02:48:01] others uh free play use Trang Ling often
[02:48:03] as copium yes but she's not copium at
[02:48:07] all but yeah people use her as copium
[02:48:09] like I used to think strangling was
[02:48:11] copium uh and honestly if you were to
[02:48:13] ask me who I prefer like who I enjoy
[02:48:15] more between duuk and Shang Ling I enjoy
[02:48:18] duuk more like I would still play duuke
[02:48:20] but that doesn't my opinion doesn't
[02:48:22] really matter like I'm still gonna say
[02:48:25] what's
[02:48:26] best why is H rated because she's good
[02:48:28] but she's not like the best and most
[02:48:30] people yeah most people most everything
[02:48:33] think she's just broken quick swap Ula
[02:48:36] is my favorite thing what the [ __ ] is
[02:48:37] quick swap Ula
[02:48:49] is it just Ula diona official beta and
[02:48:51] then you just Spam your burst or it
[02:48:53] doesn't have to be diona right YULA
[02:48:54] official bet
[02:48:58] someone could be Rosaria and then you
[02:49:00] don't have a
[02:49:03] Healer yeah so join no no sea bad we're
[02:49:08] just doing we're Vibe conten thing now I
[02:49:10] don't want to I'm going to do I'm going
[02:49:11] to do a cry domain actually I'm going to
[02:49:13] do a lava Walker we have 20 resin
[02:49:15] boom not that I don't want to see but
[02:49:17] it's Co-op Co-op is
[02:49:20] scuffed would bet be better than fishal
[02:49:23] for double cryo you okay uh just to stop
[02:49:25] you there because I don't want
[02:49:28] to uh answer okay before I even get to
[02:49:31] your question like ba I don't ever ever
[02:49:34] ever recommend running beta without
[02:49:36] another Electro character she has a high
[02:49:39] energy cost on her burst of 80 but that
[02:49:41] doesn't matter if you just run her with
[02:49:43] Fel and sometimes you can run with like
[02:49:44] Lisa but generally speaking if you just
[02:49:46] run her with Fel you're good
[02:49:49] uh so if you're
[02:49:51] asking should I run fishal or beta with
[02:49:54] my Ula always fishal but if you're like
[02:49:57] but or both basically like if you're
[02:49:58] running one run FAL but you can also run
[02:50:00] both if you
[02:50:01] want uh
[02:50:03] yeah SM forever sea dead how did you
[02:50:06] [ __ ] up your wait sea how do you mess up
[02:50:08] your own
[02:50:10] emote you literally typed one of your
[02:50:12] own emotes and it didn't
[02:50:14] show are you not the real sea
[02:50:21] I deleted it oh
[02:50:25] sad I need new emotes but also I'm so
[02:50:28] inconsistent with streaming I like lose
[02:50:30] Subs like I literally like every time I
[02:50:32] make a sub goal I'll like end up like
[02:50:35] the sub goal will be over and I'll be at
[02:50:37] the same amount of Subs I started at not
[02:50:39] that I care like I don't do this for
[02:50:40] money but still like if I get new sub
[02:50:42] new sub slots I lose
[02:50:47] them well I got a gmax Venusaur all to
[02:50:50] myself Andrea you you think I want a
[02:50:53] gmax Venusaur I have like
[02:50:58] 20 want me to make you some no I do not

[02:51:04] be mad well they I'm sure they're nice
[02:51:06] people they wouldn't be mad but I'm not
[02:51:08] going to like yoink their business you
[02:51:13] [Music]
[02:51:14] know the other DPS you be considering
[02:51:16] overrated is kaching uh I think people
[02:51:19] know kaching now like I like kaching I
[02:51:20] don't think kaching is bad I just she's
[02:51:23] not like broken and I think everyone
[02:51:25] knows that she's not like the best I
[02:51:27] think kaching Mains are the play people
[02:51:29] who play kaching are the harshest
[02:51:31] critics of kaching in my
[02:51:33] experience people no one hates kaching
[02:51:36] more than kaching Mains that's a fact
[02:51:38] that is literally a
[02:51:39] fact sag
[02:51:49] hate her a ton sad well I mean like
[02:51:55] yeah
[02:51:56] [Music]
[02:52:01] yeah meanwhile shenen means coping hey
[02:52:04] shenan are just having fun that's what
[02:52:06] counts that's what
[02:52:07] counts cuz they're having more fun than
[02:52:09] us like who's having more fun someone
[02:52:11] playing shenan having the time of their
[02:52:13] life of their life or someone playing

[02:52:48] which is kind of a Betto
[02:52:51] comp chat I think I could No Cap if I

[02:52:56] make a video before my CLE video cuz C's
[02:52:59] in uh maybe not actually I'm kind of a
[02:53:02] slow
[02:53:04] procrastinator so I don't know but that
[02:53:06] being
[02:53:07] said I'm either going to make a TF
[02:53:10] Bennett video which is like the most
[02:53:12] broken comp you've never heard of
[02:53:14] or I might do something else like a uh
[02:53:17] like best sports or something just
[02:53:19] overall or like best teams for every
[02:53:22] character or some [ __ ] you know I don't

[02:57:03] I'll eat it at a restaurant I'm not a
[02:57:04] little [ __ ] but like at the same time
[02:57:06] if you've ever had maple syrup it is
[02:57:08] literally if you don't know how much
[02:57:10] better maple syrup is if you okay I have
[02:57:13] to my Canadian's coming out a b a little
[02:57:15] too much but maple syrup is so much
[02:57:17] better
[02:57:18] is literally like exponentially better
[02:57:20] like it's like you're playing okay
[02:57:22] normal like table syrup is like playing
[02:57:25] duuke without Crimson Witch of flames or
[02:57:27] without shingu right and then Mel Ser is

[02:57:43] artifacts imagine having pancakes with
[02:57:46] syrup why would you imagine that imagine
[02:57:48] imagining having pancakes with syrup you
[02:57:51] just eat them like [ __ ] bread you
[02:57:53] just like take a fist full of pancake
[02:57:55] and put nothing on
[02:57:59] it that sounds kind of fun I wish I
[02:58:01] could eat with with like I wish it was
[02:58:03] like socially acceptable to just take
[02:58:05] fistfuls of things I know it'd be
[02:58:07] disgusting but I feel like it'd be funny
[02:58:09] you know just like imagine having a fist
[02:58:11] full of cake
[02:58:18] I actually don't have pancakes a lot I
[02:58:20] really want to though you guys are
[02:58:22] making me
[02:58:30] hungry pancakes would that's not a real
[02:58:32] word Nick pixels I'm
[02:58:34] sorry but yeah that caramel stuff is
[02:58:36] good I don't know how to pronounce it
[02:58:37] I'm not going to try but it is good
[02:58:40] actually yo wholesome
[02:58:43] story uh Alexi got me like 5 years ago
[02:58:47] got me a job of like
[02:58:50] homemade that doy Dei I don't know how
[02:58:53] to guys I'm trying to I'm going to say
[02:58:56] it as bad as possible so you don't think
[02:58:57] I'm trying to say it correctly because I
[02:58:59] don't know how to say it correctly okay
[02:59:00] so since I don't know how to say it
[02:59:01] correctly rather than embarrass myself I
[02:59:03] will say it in the worst way possible so
[02:59:05] you understand that it's me admitting
[02:59:07] that I don't know how to say it and he
[02:59:08] made me like a jar of it and it was
[02:59:10] pretty
[02:59:12] good for some occasion it might have
[02:59:14] been like it was some occasion you just
[02:59:15] got me some I was like wait pog
[02:59:19] look I don't know how to say it all
[02:59:20] right I I'm not like it's fine I'm not
[02:59:23] going to learn right now I'll learn
[02:59:25] eventually I'll better myself as a
[02:59:30] person all right it's fine it's fine
[02:59:33] we'll figure it out we'll figure it
[02:59:41] out look all I'm saying is my way
[02:59:45] probably wasn't correct okay you could
[02:59:47] like I can admit it but it was also
[02:59:50] funnier right so I think I win I think
[03:00:00] like look at least I'm I'm I'm
[03:00:02] self-aware that I can't
[03:00:04] pronounce like foreign words right I'm
[03:00:07] not going to try to say it and butcher
[03:00:09] it I'm
[03:00:11] self-aware dude I used to I used to call
[03:00:14] Ning Wong ning Wang okay I I've learned
[03:00:16] I've evolved and I have bettered myself
[03:00:19] as a human okay I am no longer the same
[03:00:23] man I once was and so I'm sure one day
[03:00:26] I'll be able to pronounce doke de
[03:00:29] efficiently okay I'm sure I'll be able
[03:00:31] to say it correctly and people be like
[03:00:33] wow are you are you where are you from
[03:00:35] how do you say it so so properly I'll be
[03:00:38] like hey I just I just know a little
[03:00:41] something you got to thank my twitch
[03:00:42] chat you know but for now like we're in
[03:00:46] the learning phase
[03:00:51] okay I don't look I say Kaa but in my
[03:00:54] videos I try to say Kaa cuz that's what
[03:00:56] I was told is I don't know dude I just I
[03:00:58] just I I'm I don't know I I don't know
[03:01:01] in my videos I'm more formal
[03:01:04] okay also I don't know what I'm
[03:01:06] doing am I out a genin Content
[03:01:09] SM we'll think about it let me go kill
[03:01:11] the boar you're in the training Arc true
[03:01:15] we're training
[03:01:18] names are all made up true that's why
[03:01:20] like if I say something in a more
[03:01:22] entertaining way then is it should it be
[03:01:24] the correct way cuz what's the point of
[03:01:26] saying it correctly if you can say
[03:01:29] it and it's more entertaining you know
[03:01:32] easy five
[03:01:34] head unless it's like someone's name
[03:01:36] obviously
[03:01:40] but pronounce Chichi as Kiki the first
[03:01:43] way of playing yes
[03:01:46] s uh I think I did too I didn't know how
[03:01:48] to pronounce like shingu or kitching or
[03:01:50] any of them I had to learn all that I
[03:01:52] mean I [ __ ] I thought it was ning
[03:01:54] Wang for like literally months but uh
[03:01:57] yeah takes a
[03:02:01] while Nick play valerant monka w i could
[03:02:04] stream OverWatch but I'd have to set it
[03:02:05] up and I don't really know how so I'd

[03:02:09] something I think tomorrow I'm either
[03:02:11] going to try to work on a video or do
[03:02:12] like two streams I'm actually not sure I
[03:02:14] might do like I'll try to actually be
[03:02:17] efficient

[03:02:24] yes I like butchering names of
[03:02:33] characters Shing Chu is good enough by
[03:02:35] the way I've I've consulted an excessive
[03:02:39] amount of of speakers of the language I
[03:02:42] we've come to the conclusion that it's
[03:02:44] it's okay that is the conclusion
