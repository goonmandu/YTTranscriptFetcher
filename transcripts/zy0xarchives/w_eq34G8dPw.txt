[00:07:46] diluk guide after our Leo um shut the
[00:07:51] [ __ ]
[00:07:56] up dude I'm so glad I didn't even think
[00:07:58] of including over load in the
[00:08:02] video thank you I would have stun locked
[00:08:04] myself into the worst team comp possible
[00:08:07] I enjoyed my
[00:08:14] stay might be good for arino though who
[00:08:17] knows no Suk well a little Suk but who
[00:08:20] knows
[00:08:39] what does stun lock
[00:08:41] mean let's say you're playing your
[00:08:43] favorite video game and the enemy
[00:08:46] presses an ability on you and you get
[00:08:48] stunned and you can't
[00:08:51] move that is a St
[00:08:58] lock a be underscore dude I just cleaned
[00:09:01] my glasses and they got
[00:09:15] dirtier hello therex Nicholas ZX I
[00:09:19] haven't tuned Chad do you think a boba
[00:09:21] would eat a or do they live peacefully
[00:09:24] skill you streamer I know also I'm
[00:09:27] always done a world by you for
[00:10:27] are you going to do the 10-sided Abyss
[00:10:29] team list oh that that z z did honestly
[00:10:34] we could if you remind me later dude uh
[00:10:36] one of the challenges I want to
[00:10:39] do I've talked about this uh a while ago
[00:10:42] but knowing my procrastination Mastery
[00:10:44] is going to take me a year and eight
[00:10:46] other people are going to make videos
[00:10:47] about it before I do but I was thinking
[00:10:48] of doing this thing where I
[00:10:53] clear when I cleared Abyss 12 with every
[00:10:56] single character in the game but I can't
[00:10:59] read use them so it has to be like
[00:11:00] different team different team different
[00:11:01] team type of thing so that's like way
[00:11:02] harder than 10 teams or eight I don't
[00:11:04] know how many you said but we could we
[00:11:05] could do that we could try to figure it
[00:11:06] out I haven't sat down and thought about
[00:11:08] what teams I would
[00:11:09] use anyways let me uh let me
[00:11:18] start engage
[00:11:30] surely sign is a part of it what if I
[00:11:32] use every character yeah if I have to
[00:11:33] make 10 teams there's actually oh yeah
[00:11:36] I'm using okay this headset is like
[00:11:37] lowkey on its last legs so I got to be
[00:11:39] delicate with it and I ordered a new one
[00:11:41] of the same so it's going to look the
[00:11:42] same but uh if this one ever like stops
[00:11:45] working I want to have a spare like I
[00:11:46] don't want to just you
[00:11:49] know
[00:11:56] yeah dude I'm not using I don't even

[00:13:52] room
[00:13:53] yes yes they said I would never

[00:15:07] Los Angeles so I was like yo I want to

[00:15:11] forgot to record this section before I
[00:15:13] left can you record it for me he's like
[00:15:15] sure and then he recorded for me and
[00:15:17] then I just delayed the upload two weeks
[00:15:18] cuz I'm a [ __ ] loser so I'm going to
[00:15:20] try to get a double swirl double swirl
[00:15:21] is when you swirl both pyro and the
[00:15:24] other element that you talk to the
[00:15:25] groaning researcher bro what are your
[00:15:27] quests Z your team generally either
[00:15:29] Hydro or wait is this my account oh this
[00:15:31] is my account and it's generally easier
[00:15:33] to do inap that's mine cuz Bloom's yeah
[00:15:37] I was on a level one Claymore for this I
[00:15:38] remember yeah that was me all good um
[00:15:42] yeah so it's out finally the [ __ ]
[00:15:44] loot gu's out uh I actually I trimmed a
[00:15:46] lot and it's still 42 minutes I was
[00:15:48] going to reexport to trim uh I was I
[00:15:50] could have saved 30 seconds here I was
[00:15:52] going to delete this part annoying if it
[00:15:53] pushes them outside of your like I don't
[00:15:55] have to tell people like think before
[00:15:56] bursting just don't be a dumbass but
[00:15:58] whatever I included it
[00:15:59] uh and
[00:16:00] also
[00:16:03] um wait what else was
[00:16:06] there yeah I I trimmed some of what Z
[00:16:09] said cuz he eventually he moved on to
[00:16:11] like you can finina Q before e but like
[00:16:14] I dude literally I don't want to talk
[00:16:17] about finina Q before E so I just put it
[00:16:20] in like a note form to save time um but
[00:16:23] yeah no it's pretty it's pretty good
[00:16:24] it's one of the more detailed guides
[00:16:25] I've made probably the most there's
[00:16:28] other guys where I've went into more
[00:16:29] details on combos cuz doesn't really
[00:16:31] have like combos just attack twice
[00:16:33] between your e it's not that hard but
[00:16:35] Hydro supports in general are not just
[00:16:36] very strong characters like anyways it's
[00:16:40] out the Luke yolan and finina are really
[00:16:44] really powerful but also can apply a ton
[00:16:47] zero CLE guys in three years you pulled
[00:16:49] for Cle sorry I'm sorry for legal
[00:16:52] reasons that was a joke I'm sorry for
[00:16:55] example applies so much you can vaporize
[00:16:57] very consistently and easily and will
[00:16:59] apply Hydro at a much faster rate than
[00:17:01] your standard cryo support will apply
[00:17:04] cryo for all those reasons vaporiz has
[00:17:06] been the standard for a lot of but
[00:17:09] yeah D gu
[00:17:13] ring dude Elden ring will happen you
[00:17:16] guys need something to look forward to I
[00:17:18] don't want to like you ever okay anyone

[00:37:05] week buy I'm not buying but we're
[00:37:07] getting 50 can I get 50 let's do the
[00:37:08] math so this is one level that's another
[00:37:11] level two that's roughly three with this
[00:37:14] it would be like let's say four total
[00:37:16] then that that would be another two so

[00:37:55] probably get 47 and then m three that's
[00:37:58] unlucky but it's fine I'm going to like

[00:43:10] her own Crimson witch with finina Mar
[00:43:12] always is like about as good or slightly
[00:43:15] better or slightly worse than your
[00:43:16] signature option with with Hut is just
[00:43:19] substats just
[00:43:24] pick it might be slightly better but
[00:43:27] it's I yeah I'd have to
[00:43:35] check okay are we
[00:43:47] ready 9% wait I saw a video on this who
[00:43:51] made it oh I think it was [ __ ] uh TGs
[00:44:05] um TCG B no that's not who I'm talking
[00:44:10] about okay it's not a leak video though
[00:44:13] I can't show like leak videos but this
[00:44:14] he this isn't a leak video so
[00:44:22] uh his CS not mine so shout out to him
[00:44:26] but uh this is what it it is given I
[00:44:29] don't know what his assumptions are so
[00:44:31] it might be flawed it might not be I
[00:44:33] don't know I I didn't do it but yeah
[00:44:37] basically this just means sub stats
[00:44:38] although 9% is more than I thought I
[00:44:40] thought it' be more like five or like
[00:44:42] like yeah but
[00:44:45] yeah still still sub stats mag is just
[00:44:48] really efficient to farm unlike

[01:21:05] hypothetical uh uh uh uh
[01:21:17] person every time I join stream I feel
[01:21:20] relieved because socks always stalls for
[01:21:23] at least hour I don't L for Prime gaming
[01:21:26] I appreciate it uh you said Shia
[01:21:29] okay uh 1,900 attack what's your weapon
[01:21:33] that's not going to show me jade spear
[01:21:36] R3 c0 Triple Crown I respect

[01:21:47] to okay can I be honest or do I have to
[01:21:49] be nice just tell me right now straight
[01:21:51] up tell tell me do I have to be honest
[01:21:53] or can I be nice like do I have to be
[01:21:54] nice or
[01:21:55] it's not bad you could go based on sub
[01:21:57] stle Shia so if if like two emblem is is
[01:21:59] fine golden troop is dog [ __ ] but but
[01:22:03] but if the sub stats are good it's
[01:22:09] okay and I respect you for farming
[01:22:13] this okay no I don't okay okay if you
[01:22:16] farm marish like golden true Mar instead
[01:22:18] of Vermillion that makes sense for your
[01:22:20] account it's smart but if you also have
[01:22:22] Echo then that's that something isn't
[01:22:24] adding
[01:22:26] up okay let me look at these pieces
[01:22:30] flower okay now I'm mad at you see you
[01:22:32] didn't have to have a flower this good
[01:22:34] now I don't even want to be nice anymore
[01:22:36] why is this on sh instead of like yo
[01:22:39] okay you have
[01:22:41] two okay let me look at the feather
[01:22:44] that's an offset Vermilion by the way um
[01:22:47] that's a decent sand a pretty good sand
[01:22:50] that's a decent goblet pretty good
[01:22:52] pretty good I mean this is all good but
[01:22:54] but
[01:22:56] but why aren't you going at least like
[01:22:58] two Vermillion two Vermillion two of is
[01:22:59] fine there's no reason to go two golden
[01:23:01] troop like this is a really good
[01:23:03] piece I mean maybe you don't have
[01:23:05] another enemo goblet I
[01:23:10] guess that's good though it's a good
[01:23:12] Chow what's your ratio 81 to okay you
[01:23:16] needed the emblem holy
[01:23:18] [ __ ] that's exactly just
[01:23:23] emblem all right it's good I would
[01:23:26] recommend a better set but it's fine you
[01:23:29] should be like you can clear 12 with
[01:23:30] this if you have a team that doesn't
[01:23:34] suck 70250 better wait
[01:23:40] what why would you lower your crit
[01:23:49] rate no no I mean like if you have 70
[01:23:52] 250 like you're fine it's not bad but
[01:23:55] like why would you do
[01:24:07] that review my Clash of Clan base I'm
[01:24:10] not doing that I will however review the
[01:24:14] uh mail that yolan gave
[01:24:17] us can you play Elden ring already
[01:24:20] please I will I will thank you a few
[01:24:24] fresh flowers I recently tossed the dice
[01:24:27] on a whim and rolled growing flowers off
[01:24:29] the list now since having a bit more
[01:24:32] color around the house couldn't hurt I
[01:24:33] picked up a few sprigs from the flower
[01:24:36] market but not long after I potted them
[01:24:38] a pile of hardto crack cases ended up at
[01:24:41] my desk I was tied up for months I
[01:24:44] barely even had time to water them more
[01:24:46] than a few times I assumed they'd be far
[01:24:49] too parched to flour but they turned out
[01:24:52] to be more resilient than I thought
[01:24:55] and stubbornly budded I guess the old
[01:24:58] saying fearlessly the petals V the
[01:25:00] biting cold they deny was inspired by
[01:25:04] tenacious little flowers like these
[01:25:06] premium te's already brewed so if you'd
[01:25:07] like to admire them with me better hurry
[01:25:10] oh doubt she's a woman of
[01:25:15] action uh Shia's letter was still better
[01:25:17] though Shia said hey I dreamed of
[01:25:21] you please
[01:25:24] if you'd like to meet me call me that's
[01:25:27] what he said he said I didn't like
[01:25:30] dreaming but I dream of you and it makes
[01:25:31] me smile I wish that were real shiao is
[01:25:34] truly the rizzler of Our
[01:25:39] Generation
[01:25:45] anyways you ruined
[01:25:52] it do you remember his first letter what
[01:25:55] do you mean you do I remember
[01:25:56] [ __ ] I have it it's right here
[01:26:00] there was nothing for me to do today so
[01:26:02] I decided I would find a crystal fly for
[01:26:03] you to put it in your hair I thought
[01:26:05] that it would look nice the next thing I
[01:26:06] knew I had caught several more than I
[01:26:08] intended I hope you do not mind if you
[01:26:10] wish to meet me speak my name to be able
[01:26:13] to spend some time with you is
[01:26:17] enough and Shang Ling had to [ __ ]
[01:26:19] ruin it when we had our alone time with
[01:26:21] Shia Shang Ling was like oh am I
[01:26:23] interrupting
[01:26:25] yes you are Shang Ling yes you are lay
[01:26:28] line overflow let me go do
[01:26:37] that is there a glitch at
[01:26:40] 3620 in the delute guide I will check

[01:26:44] frame of Shang Ling you will be banned
[01:26:46] forever if you are trolling me you will
[01:26:48] be banned 3620 you better not be [ __ ]
[01:26:51] trolling me it does not look like a
[01:26:53] blacken screen so you're probably
[01:26:55] trolling me comp that can work although
[01:26:57] it's not my favorite lastly you can play
[01:26:59] duuke in a mono Pyro Team with Bennett
[01:27:01] and then flexible supports Kazo is
[01:27:02] obviously the best here for a huge
[01:27:04] amount of pyro damage cuz I said Bennett
[01:27:06] yeah but Bennett's like the Luke's best
[01:27:07] support there wasn't even Shang Ling
[01:27:09] there Shang Lings
[01:27:11] later for a more unique team comp that
[01:27:14] can work although it's not my favorite
[01:27:16] lastly you can play duuke in a mono okay

[01:35:30] Nita thank you for the
[01:35:32] D wait wrong set X appreciate it l
[01:35:41] bits you're the best streamer ever True
[01:35:44] by the way uh this is actually good
[01:35:46] though this is actually good
[01:35:48] because my AO I think he's on like five
[01:35:51] Echo usually uh um unless I'm I'm I'm
[01:35:55] Ayo
[01:35:56] maxing but his flower is like one of his
[01:35:58] worst
[01:35:59] pieces
[01:36:02] so the neosis is Misfortune chat don't
[01:36:05] listen to my lore takes I'm just [ __ ]
[01:36:06] posting okay I just say what I think is
[01:36:08] the funniest you don't have to you don't
[01:36:11] have to take it like sometimes I see
[01:36:12] comments like oh I can't believe feel
[01:36:14] EXO skip dude I'm just here I'm vibing
[01:36:17] okay don't take my my lore yapping
[01:36:19] seriously I'm just yapping I do pay
[01:36:22] attention during archon Quest I do I do
[01:36:24] but I'm not I don't know that much so
[01:36:26] you can go to someone else for those
[01:36:28] takes I'm just yapping I would rather
[01:36:31] them not make do or playable at all if
[01:36:33] they're going to make him be a good guy
[01:36:35] let villains stay bad please your name
[01:36:38] is Kermit booty hair shavings please
[01:36:40] refrain from giving your opinion however
[01:36:42] I think the tier list is the best
[01:36:44] outcome dor stays evil and he's just an
[01:36:46] evil character like he should be and
[01:36:47] then he dies a painful death but he's
[01:36:48] still playable second best outcome is
[01:36:54] I don't know actually in the story would
[01:36:56] make more like it makes more sense for
[01:36:58] him to just be evil and die but I also
[01:37:00] selfishly really want to play him so I
[01:37:02] don't know but I yeah we'll
[01:37:13] see I foret this a 9 plus game well yeah
[01:37:17] but
[01:37:20] like so
[01:37:24] like whatever dor did he did it's not
[01:37:26] like the rating if he's playable or not
[01:37:28] it won't affect the rating I don't think
[01:37:31] like no you can play as a mean
[01:37:37] character I don't know maybe I'm wrong
[01:37:40] all right let's do this Gamba good
[01:37:43] luck okay uh well that's one for
[01:37:46] believers that's two for believers ER em
[01:37:50] def kind of not good that's three for
[01:37:52] belie oo no that's the wrong set but

[01:40:24] to off piece of flower but it's like all
[01:40:26] the rolls are good ER roll is good HP
[01:40:29] roll is good crit rolls are good that's
[01:40:32] good it's just not good for aoto but I
[01:40:35] mean it might be better than this like I
[01:40:37] don't really have the best IO
[01:40:39] piece
[01:40:43] uh I guess it
[01:40:46] is is it even better than that though
[01:40:49] [Music]
[01:40:51] 624 uh yes I think I need the crit rate
[01:40:57] more okay it's not good but it might
[01:41:00] help me um hit another ER threshold
[01:41:02] which would help me uh [ __ ] aasha
[01:41:11] rmax I it technically does we'll
[01:41:15] see aasha Andy dude [ __ ] you I wish
[01:41:20] there was a better way of doing it okay
[01:41:22] but there isn't
[01:41:24] how much attack do you have in your AA
[01:41:27] SLS doesn't that mean like sarcasm why
[01:41:30] are you even asking what the [ __ ] are
[01:41:31] you doing why would you add a SL what
[01:41:33] are you doing what does that mean I I
[01:41:36] don't even want to I'm not even going to
[01:41:37] show you I don't know I don't know I
[01:41:39] don't know I
[01:41:42] like I'm playing duuke I'm playing duuke
[01:41:44] I'm playing duuke we're playing duuke
[01:41:46] we're playing
[01:41:48] duuke it means serious no that's like
[01:41:50] SRS but also you don't need to if you're
[01:41:53] asking a question you don't need to add
[01:41:54] serious cuz why would that be a joke no
[01:41:56] one's like oh what's your
[01:41:58] attack I don't know I don't think she's
[01:42:00] geared Loki wait she is okay she's on a
[01:42:04] fourstar so this is like relatable you
[01:42:06] get me it's not even bad uh it's usually
[01:42:08] this piece but okay okay uh okay
[01:42:13] uh
[01:42:15] okay
[01:42:17] okay s is for
[01:42:20] socks oh
[01:42:23] time to shine I'm not swirling pyro I
[01:42:26] did a whole I spent hours making the
[01:42:29] perfect double swirl pyro rotation and
[01:42:31] explanation just to never do it in my
[01:42:33] free time cuz it's a waste of my life
[01:42:36] but if you want to know how you you can
[01:42:37] watch my video it's
[01:42:43] cool dude it was actually oh I need
[01:42:45] caness resin it was actually so annoying
[01:42:48] to record like every clear making sure I
[01:42:51] double swirl or I [ __ ] reset
[01:42:53] it was dude it's so [ __ ] too cuz if
[01:42:56] you don't have C6 benett and you're not
[01:42:57] C4 in you're not using your C4 cuz like
[01:43:00] like it's annoying and a waste of DPS
[01:43:02] it's like it's annoying it's like Ping
[01:43:04] dependent it's like the enemy might [ __ ]
[01:43:06] up dependent so
[01:43:09] yeah like uh even the rotation part was
[01:43:12] I mean it's not hard on this guy though
[01:43:13] this guy's pretty consistent
[01:43:24] oh once again another day another
[01:43:28] chatter who said review my EU sha and
[01:43:31] then a mod replied he's not checking
[01:43:33] your eia and now in order to make my
[01:43:35] Mod's life more difficult I will
[01:43:37] actually review your EU Shia you are
[01:43:39] welcome H let me pull up enko right now
[01:43:42] we will do this random EU Shia review uh
[01:43:45] so I'm sorry hey it's a classic in this
[01:43:48] channel I'm sorry uh Shia on Deathmatch
[01:43:52] 63m I don't know why I pointed that out
[01:43:54] it's useless uh 120 ER your talents are
[01:43:57] not leveled properly you want to Max
[01:43:59] your normal attacks nothing else really
[01:44:00] level the others too but like the
[01:44:02] difference between a normal attack level
[01:44:03] and the others level is like huge so
[01:44:05] definitely get your normals to 10 I at
[01:44:07] least nine uh crit ratio is honestly
[01:44:10] good ideally a bit more crit damage a
[01:44:13] bit less crit rate not because 98 is bad
[01:44:15] 98 is like it's optimal to get as close
[01:44:18] to 100 as you can but there's Buffs to
[01:44:20] crit rate that can happen for example
[01:44:22] Abyss can give you 8% so I like to not
[01:44:23] be higher than 92 if you're running Shan
[01:44:25] Yun she can give you I think it's like 4
[01:44:27] to 10% when you're plunging so again
[01:44:29] right you might not want to be at 98 but
[01:44:31] it's still good uh your attack's low but
[01:44:33] you're on death match so expected your
[01:44:35] death match is level 80 actually which
[01:44:36] means your AR might be
[01:44:38] low wait what okay never mind you like
[01:44:41] your Hut more than your sha uh Case
[01:44:43] Closed uh you are not a real Shia main
[01:44:46] you are not worthy of this review
[01:44:48] however your artifacts are pretty good
[01:44:51] level your weapon please
[01:44:58] okay stop typing your EU shs it was one
[01:45:01] exception okay I I'm sorry I'm sorry let
[01:45:05] me go con resin I don't know why we're
[01:45:06] at 240
[01:45:18] caught you enabled them I know I know
[01:45:20] but like I was just being a bit like it
[01:45:22] was a little bit of Tom Foolery I was
[01:45:24] doing a little bit of Tom Foolery genin
[01:45:27] Creator exposed my thoughts on the genin
[01:45:31] Creator
[01:45:33] exposed dude my [ __ ] Twitter feed has
[01:45:35] been so ass recently I mean it's always
[01:45:37] like that it's like [ __ ] valerant
[01:45:40] drama or vtuber drama and both of them I
[01:45:43] I make me want to run my head into a
[01:45:45] post in game like I don't care like why
[01:45:48] do I keep seeing this I'm not even
[01:45:49] clicking on them I don't care
[01:45:55] just follow art accounts dude maybe I
[01:45:57] need the fob Master
[01:46:01] approach maybe that's the
[01:46:09] take just deactivate k
[01:46:21] w just use the following tab dude I
[01:46:24] can't help it I can't help it okay I try
[01:46:27] to use the following tab I try W I try
[01:46:29] but something drives me to the other one
[01:46:31] I think when I open the app it's on the
[01:46:32] other one but something draws me there I
[01:46:34] don't know why it just
[01:46:37] happens the [ __ ] are those marks on the
[01:46:40] map which ones I mean I used to have I
[01:46:45] used to farm enemies like there's Abyss
[01:46:46] mes there the they're there I used to
[01:46:49] farm enemies in 1.0 I used to also mine
[01:46:52] uh cor lapis and other ores um I don't
[01:46:55] know why there's Z chest but it's iconic
[01:46:58] and whenever I would reset Primo Vis
[01:46:59] apps I accidentally click on this and I
[01:47:01] find it funny so I don't remove it um
[01:47:04] for examp there's also these which yo
[01:47:08] this is me from 3.5 haha how's the
[01:47:14] content is there new co-op
[01:47:17] raids
[01:47:20] aware hey did you know you could
[01:47:21] subscribe for free using time but most
[01:47:24] of the maps are just most of the pins
[01:47:25] are just useful stuff so like like if I
[01:47:27] want to do like mining there's like a
[01:47:28] ore uh ball okay except that one but
[01:47:31] like usually it's like okay for the most
[01:47:33] part it's like these are all crystal
[01:47:34] flies so like I I usually am short on
[01:47:36] crystal flies cuz I condense all my
[01:47:38] resin so like let's have one Crystal F
[01:47:40] boom there's a Mark here boom boom boom
[01:47:41] there's going to be
[01:47:43] three true thank you I learned something
[01:47:46] new thanks so
[01:47:48] much thank
[01:47:50] you did you know you're weird
[01:47:57] but like what is worse being weird or
[01:47:59] being normal cuz if you're normal you're
[01:48:01] like you're Bland like no one cares but
[01:48:03] if you're weird at least you got
[01:48:04] personality at least you have some
[01:48:07] flare

[01:48:29] big Sask Sask Sask
[01:48:34] Sask left of desert I guess that would
[01:48:36] make sense cuz like warm here and then
[01:48:38] it's like pyro so like
[01:48:40] here but I can't scroll my map any
[01:48:43] further like it only lets me go here but
[01:48:44] if I go north look at how high I can go
[01:48:46] I guess cuz there's [ __ ]
[01:48:48] there maybe because there's [ __ ] there

[02:09:01] phase reaction so I don't remember
[02:09:03] rolling Crossfire was uh I did this one
[02:09:07] what the [ __ ] was
[02:09:10] it f like the [ __ ] meow one was
[02:09:15] fine shooting Cannon
[02:09:20] oh yeah
[02:09:22] I like that we got the pets of stuff
[02:09:25] though how with the following characters
[02:09:27] chori
[02:09:39] nevet Gamers I'm testing out Tori in her
[02:09:43] test run here and I've got a rant for a
[02:09:45] second in 2024 why are they still giving
[02:09:49] us these random units and not allowing
[02:09:51] us to use our own teams let me test her
[02:09:54] on my team to see if she's any good you
[02:09:56] know what I'm saying let me try her with
[02:09:58] Aro let me try her with Navia let me use
[02:10:01] my Max I mean that's fair anyways uh uh
[02:10:06] okay nevet yeah he's a [ __ ] Chad
[02:10:08] honestly I'm going to do somewhat
[02:10:10] because I think he's lowkey too broken
[02:10:12] in my humble opinion but I mean I love
[02:10:14] him so whatever um chori
[02:10:21] slight upgrade to albo cool for geo
[02:10:24] players kind of whatever if not is that
[02:10:26] a bad thing no I'd rather have that than
[02:10:29] constant power
[02:10:30] creep is it a good thing
[02:10:35] so I mean I guess that's neutral yeah
[02:10:37] know
[02:10:39] neutral which are characters you own yep
[02:10:42] yep uh
[02:10:45] characterization she's sassy she's cool
[02:10:48] I like chori
[02:10:49] art pretty cool as well but still Gio so
[02:10:52] that's minus one check if she wasn't Gio
[02:10:54] i''d be here sorry damage dealing
[02:10:56] ability uh honestly her THS are they're
[02:10:58] pretty cool like I don't think there's
[02:10:59] nothing wrong with that teamwork ability
[02:11:01] I mean she's Geo so it's restricted the
[02:11:03] fact that c you need C1 to work properly
[02:11:05] with like well you work without Navia
[02:11:07] anyways but um but um but um didn't do
[02:11:10] the story Quest okay I didn't do the
[02:11:11] story Quest do is she not am I supposed
[02:11:13] to not like her I I like her okay I'll
[02:11:15] do the quest one day uh uh uh teamwork
[02:11:17] ability yeah I wish that C1 was a part
[02:11:19] of her kit like a lot of characters but
[02:11:21] outside of that cool uh but it's
[02:11:23] teamwork ability so I would actually
[02:11:25] probably put it unsatisfied somewhat
[02:11:27] because it's a geoc character of all
[02:11:30] times I X dead bro is not doing the
[02:11:33] quest I will I will I will I
[02:11:40] will support
[02:11:42] capability wait what's between uh how
[02:11:46] well she supports your team yeah someone
[02:11:49] satisfied control movement um character
[02:11:52] voiceover satisfied control movement
[02:11:54] lowkey controversial
[02:11:57] take okay on one hand it's really cool
[02:12:00] that there's like a new thing where oh
[02:12:02] [ __ ] you can swap directly by pressing
[02:12:03] your e but on the other hand [ __ ] you
[02:12:05] for making me order my team in a certain
[02:12:07] way she works in any team yeah so does
[02:12:10] albo but you're not playing albo with
[02:12:12] your freaking frecking why did I say
[02:12:14] frecking that is a world
[02:12:19] record like okay the argument like you
[02:12:22] can like Flex a Geo character in like
[02:12:24] any team but like one it's not that good
[02:12:26] and two chor is pretty decent like she's
[02:12:29] pretty good but the thing is is like
[02:12:31] with a lot of characters like Navia or I
[02:12:33] think Noel's no yeah Noel is the other
[02:12:36] one that like just don't have constructs
[02:12:38] you either you only get one doll if
[02:12:40] you're not C1 which is kind of
[02:12:43] sadge anyways what I was going to say is
[02:12:46] I think she she has a unique mechanic
[02:12:48] which is cool and I like design that
[02:12:50] gives you unique mechanics but what the
[02:12:52] unique mechanic is I kind of don't like
[02:12:54] so it's a little weird um like it's not
[02:12:56] that I don't like it it's that it's
[02:12:58] annoying uh to build your team
[02:13:02] around does the control movement refer
[02:13:04] to the movement passive okay there's no
[02:13:06] way it's about the movement
[02:13:08] passive so um I'm going to neutral it
[02:13:11] actually I'm definitely nonneutral but I
[02:13:13] don't know if I'm satisfied or
[02:13:18] unsatisfied [ __ ] it so any other
[02:13:21] feedback
[02:13:23] please let me
[02:13:26] swap to any character I
[02:13:30] desire by
[02:13:32] holding I mean how would you even do it
[02:13:34] on mobile you can't like I would say
[02:13:36] hold three but you can't really do that
[02:13:38] on
[02:13:48] mobile you can
[02:13:58] let's pretend they will read
[02:14:02] this chori
[02:14:05] smile uh nevet I mean I like
[02:14:10] nevet oh support capability is not good
[02:14:12] but like I don't want him to be a
[02:14:14] support if he was also a support the
[02:14:16] yeah it's [ __ ] over uh control
[02:14:19] movement
[02:14:21] honestly kind of annoying without C1 but
[02:14:23] I'm not unsatisfied with it just use the
[02:14:29] shield Hydro Dragon
[02:14:34] raar how you the following weapons uraku
[02:14:37] misiri to of the Eternal flow I kind of
[02:14:40] don't care I'm going be honest uh I mean
[02:14:43] uraku is good for like
[02:14:44] albo it's it's all right neutral to to's
[02:14:48] cool
[02:14:52] have not done it have not done it uh yes
[02:14:56] I know about
[02:14:58] it how satisfied are you I'm
[02:15:00] unsatisfied
[02:15:04] uh okay
[02:15:11] okay it just isn't long
[02:15:14] enough like make it last for like 20
[02:15:17] decades so you can actually build pity
[02:15:18] slowly so that it's not like oh oh it's
[02:15:21] gone oh [ __ ]
[02:15:25] you um if I miss chronicled wish like
[02:15:29] I'd rather have it than not have it but
[02:15:30] I wish it was done better that's all I
[02:15:32] may get characters or weapons I don't
[02:15:34] want no new characters will not be added
[02:15:37] I mean who cares if I miss the chronicle
[02:15:38] wish it can take a long
[02:15:40] time yes that's but that's not the main
[02:15:43] thing but yes I already have characters
[02:15:45] and weapons no one cares there are too
[02:15:46] many characters and weapons that can be
[02:15:47] obtained at the same time
[02:15:51] I don't know when the Chron cold wish
[02:15:52] will be available this is a another
[02:15:55] thing please make it last
[02:15:59] longer to properly build to properly
[02:16:04] ramp up on the Fate pity
[02:16:10] also fate
[02:16:13] Point carrying over would be nice next
[02:16:19] how satisfy you with characters weapons
[02:16:20] that can be obtained
[02:16:21] um I mean the characters that were there
[02:16:24] were fine like it makes sense monat
[02:16:26] standard charact like that that was fine
[02:16:27] I don't think that was a bad part of it
[02:16:29] I think that was fine for like the two
[02:16:30] people that want CLE or Ula like I would
[02:16:33] rather have that than just a CLE Ula
[02:16:35] rerun for 10 years like 30 days of just
[02:16:37] Cula I'd rather have that there so that
[02:16:40] that's fine um that wasn't the main
[02:16:44] issue which voice of language you use
[02:16:47] wait I use multiple hello English I
[02:16:49] guess do you have any other

[02:21:45] death time we are very busy and this
[02:21:49] would take too long for Niche
[02:21:54] content well boy I am glad you brought
[02:21:58] that
[02:21:59] up
[02:22:01] firstly it would take little to no Dev
[02:22:06] time at all previous previously loved
[02:22:10] events such as the ENA zuman
[02:22:15] Labyrinth would take minimal effort to
[02:22:18] recycle with scale able
[02:22:22] difficulties Co-op enabled and rewards
[02:22:25] to obtain this does not even need to be
[02:22:30] focused around Primo gems there can be
[02:22:35] weapons

[02:50:13] last piece so it's like balance it's
[02:50:16] okay aventurine piece ra wrong Game Dude
[02:50:19] wrong
[02:50:22] game
[02:50:26] that do I even level this like I feel
[02:50:28] like it's
[02:50:30] useless like I'm I'm not playing crit on
[02:50:32] the set raycore FM donated
[02:50:37] $14 best Canadian line 650
[02:50:42] million 161,000 you might be the only
[02:50:45] Canadian Linny but fine fine what is
[02:50:50] this
[02:50:55] um dude I can't the numbers they're
[02:50:57] they're
[02:51:01] moving why is there a colon 3 in your
[02:51:03] name and a [ __ ] face here I'm I'm
[02:51:05] about I'm about to press this x you are
[02:51:07] on strike two already and I didn't even
[02:51:09] look at your line yet you're on strike
[02:51:11] two of three if I see one more strike
[02:51:13] you're out Triple Crown C3 honestly I
[02:51:17] respect this so far Zer em meaning you
[02:51:19] probably have really good substat
[02:51:21] distribution substat investment let's
[02:51:24] look at this that's a good flower that's
[02:51:27] a good feather honestly you might be
[02:51:28] overcapping on crit rate um H maybe not
[02:51:32] we'll see Sans that's good
[02:51:35] well it's it's not great but it's
[02:51:40] okay good
[02:51:44] goblet okay ciret what does your Liney
[02:51:48] look like
[02:51:49] 6256 that means you have 96 crit
[02:51:54] rate that's good so good Linny now if
[02:51:57] you want a min max here's the secret
[02:52:00] Tech Linny doesn't need that many sub
[02:52:02] stats cuz like you don't need that much
[02:52:05] crit rate because you get
[02:52:07] enough uh well you you want crit rate
[02:52:09] but like you have crit Ascension you
[02:52:10] have Mar so you don't need like that
[02:52:12] much but you want crit rate and you want
[02:52:14] crit damage but at a certain point it's
[02:52:15] like there's other stats you're looking
[02:52:17] for too right and that's attack usually
[02:52:20] but with attack the thing is you're
[02:52:21] running power resonance Bennett and no
[02:52:22] bless so you also kind of don't care but
[02:52:25] if you want a turbo min max what you can
[02:52:26] do is on a piece like this
[02:52:28] right you can get a sand that has like a
[02:52:31] [ __ ] ton of crit damage and no other
[02:52:32] subs and then on your other pieces you
[02:52:34] can get um cuz it can't get attack
[02:52:36] percent so then your other pieces you
[02:52:38] can get attack percent uh and then help
[02:52:40] balance your ratio so for example or
[02:52:41] like crit rate so like if this had the
[02:52:43] crit rate you need on your circlet uh
[02:52:44] like here then here you could have
[02:52:45] attack percent because you can't get
[02:52:46] attack perent on the S like on the sub
[02:52:48] side does that actually matter no it
[02:52:50] doesn't really matter your Len is good
[02:52:51] but uh the only other subset you could
[02:52:53] you could uh maximize is attack r five
[02:52:56] the bow no don't well you can but
[02:52:59] don't I guess you also get attacked from
[02:53:02] the [ __ ] bow right anyways good Lenny
[02:53:05] what's your gaming
[02:53:12] like okay I'm bored
[02:53:20] okay let me let me Forge my battle pass

[03:07:32] particularly hard Shia is currently top
[03:07:34] three top five before being generous in

[03:18:56] one's
[03:19:00] fine wait Fang's FaceTiming me the
[03:19:06] hell hey gorgeous oh hi if you're going
[03:19:10] to play n there's a character that looks
[03:19:12] like Shia there well I thought they were
[03:19:14] all women
[03:19:17] okay so what you're going to have to do
[03:19:18] is that you're going to have to go look
[03:19:19] through like every single character
[03:19:22] until you eventually find the one that
[03:19:23] looks like Shia and then you're going to
[03:19:25] have to also not only look at them but
[03:19:27] also look at their firing
[03:19:31] positions uh like the one where they
[03:19:33] like shoot and their butt Jiggles I saw
[03:19:35] that I saw all of
[03:19:37] them
[03:19:45] what caught
[03:19:47] no I didn't actually say all them but I
[03:19:48] know about that I didn't even want to
[03:19:50] say it but you no no I didn't look at
[03:19:51] them all but like I know I know about it
[03:19:54] dude I once I made the grave mistake of
[03:19:57] entering fob master stream and it was
[03:19:59] just [ __ ] okay ni I listen man okay
[03:20:04] listen listen listen listen I really
[03:20:05] respect you okay and who you are as a
[03:20:08] person but you literally came to my
[03:20:11] stream to call out one of your Chatters
[03:20:14] who was in my stream
[03:20:17] my VIP several potatoes this
[03:20:19] [ __ ] is like oh yeah I have
[03:20:20] every Nik Nike
[03:20:23] character you're literally proving my
[03:20:26] point no no I just caught like you
[03:20:29] caught you also caught you got caught
[03:20:31] one I was going to say red-handed but in
[03:20:32] this instance one-handed
[03:20:37] yo okay what is
[03:20:39] your literally just me right at my bad
[03:20:42] my
[03:20:44] bad okay um anyways if you won an i
[03:20:48] tracker I think you should actually make
[03:20:49] it like a sub bow or a donut because I
[03:20:52] think people would love to see you with
[03:20:54] an eye tracker while playing no no I
[03:20:57] don't but what do you mean I just look
[03:20:58] at characters's eyes doesn't matter like
[03:21:00] there's nothing to look
[03:21:02] at Nick I can pull up like responses
[03:21:06] that you no no no you can't you can't
[03:21:08] also I'm like a billionaire so I don't
[03:21:09] need a sub goal if anything if anything
[03:21:12] like I have like I'm like you heard of
[03:21:14] Jeff Bezos he com to me for financial
[03:21:17] advice have you heard of Jeff yeah yeah
[03:21:20] no big
[03:21:21] deal okay
[03:21:23] yeah uhuh
[03:21:28] yeah what is your
[03:21:30] point I don't
[03:21:32] know I didn't expect to make it this far
[03:21:35] you know you do this thing where like
[03:21:37] every time you're caught you immediately
[03:21:39] start stting the most I get nervous
[03:21:41] around
[03:21:43] women
[03:21:45] okay so how you doing anyways you should
[03:21:49] you should actually tryk like I'm not
[03:21:50] even lying you're probably going to hate
[03:21:52] it because you're like oh this doesn't
[03:21:53] look like B doesn't feel like Bor I
[03:21:55] can't mold because they're pretty women
[03:21:57] but you're gonna love it because there's
[03:21:58] pretty women thing when if I ever said
[03:22:01] wow I love this game there's pretty
[03:22:03] women you will okay no I'm so serious
[03:22:09] okay thank
[03:22:10] you I'll keep that in mind can you
[03:22:13] actually make a goal uh
[03:22:17] yes really
[03:22:21] yeah CH you heard a here
[03:22:25] first yeah I probably will never do it
[03:22:28] but but it sounds like a good idea so if
[03:22:30] I ever get an eye tracker I'm
[03:22:32] down
[03:22:34] hi big
[03:22:37] fan okay I have to go waste all my res

[03:22:53] is like how do you install it like what
[03:22:56] how does it detect is it like webcam
[03:22:58] does your webcam tell you where you're
[03:23:00] looking the
[03:23:13] million B you probably calibrate it I I
[03:23:18] see of course you would
[03:23:24] know stop flexing your iPhone 15 dude I
[03:23:28] hate it I just my old one [ __ ] like
[03:23:30] started overheating so have to upgrade
[03:23:32] it's not a flex I don't like it I wish I
[03:23:34] had my old one it still annoys
[03:23:37] me dude okay I don't know what this is
[03:23:39] but okay so I like having like
[03:23:41] predictive text where like I'm typing
[03:23:42] and then I'll type eyes and then the eye
[03:23:44] emoji will appear and then I tap it okay
[03:23:46] I type hot face boom it appears I tap it
[03:23:49] but for some reason now it's been autoc
[03:23:50] completing my words so I have to disable
[03:23:52] predictive but now the [ __ ] thing on
[03:23:54] top left and I can't find a middle
[03:23:56] ground and I there's like smart the
[03:23:58] predictive that I disabled it still
[03:23:59] doesn't work I don't know
[03:24:03] whatever is it pro Max no it's just
[03:24:06] normal Pro I I'm not a big fan of
[03:24:08] excessively large
[03:24:10] phone it's not just size
[03:24:17] anyways that's a good idea though I
[03:24:19] might I might make the [ __ ] ey
[03:24:20] tracker a sub goal or not a sub goal
[03:24:22] just like a stream at some point like
[03:24:24] with no
[03:24:27] goal
[03:24:29] yeah wow seven mon that's not what she
[03:24:32] said wait what do you mean on the
[03:24:33] million and scream that's crazy you
[03:24:35] getting Al
[03:24:37] side dude I have to pee so bad but what
[03:24:40] was I going to do oh the domain stuff
[03:24:42] okay I'll think about it okay let me pee
[03:24:45] first
[03:24:49] wait do I have a piece I can I can I can
[03:24:51] I can like I was going to say Edge but

[03:29:13] sparkle e to the power of H
[03:29:20] what
[03:29:28] what
[03:29:31] H okay the only problem
[03:29:36] who okay actually okay here's my
[03:29:38] thoughts here's my thoughts I
[03:29:41] think domain efficiency tier list could
[03:29:44] be a main Channel video if I wait till
[03:29:46] after our Lino set comes out so that we
[03:29:48] can talk about the new I think that's
[03:29:49] what I was waiting for I don't think I
[03:29:50] was just stalling for no reason I know
[03:29:51] my battle pass is too low level cuz I
[03:29:53] forgot to claim for like two weeks I'm
[03:29:54] sorry please don't get mad at me I'm
[03:29:55] sorry please I'm sorry I'm
[03:30:02] sorry can you do a set was the best set
[03:30:05] for supports on HSR like they have
[03:30:07] [ __ ] good sets the only support set
[03:30:10] is the [ __ ] the speed one and the
[03:30:11] wind
[03:30:13] one so you usually just go sub stats
[03:30:18] usually it's speed if you're a giga Chad
[03:30:20] and you know what you're doing wind is
[03:30:22] low-key slept on especially for supports
[03:30:24] or acaron but also no one cares just go
[03:30:26] sub
[03:30:28] stats
[03:30:30] anyways
[03:30:42] um yeah I think I will wait to do this
[03:30:46] till the arino set's released if I
[03:30:48] forget remind me remind me or if I
[03:30:51] remember on my own before I'm reminded
[03:30:53] every VIP and mod will be banned and
[03:30:56] then it will be Anarchy and aboba will
[03:31:01] rign started seeing gu saying wiet the
[03:31:03] glazing begins
[03:31:05] aboba okay just have you know just have
[03:31:09] you know just just let it be
[03:31:12] known zff did it zff has been glazing
[03:31:15] that set since like like the day the
[03:31:18] game came
[03:31:22] out I think it depends I think a lot of
[03:31:24] people are myself included are too
[03:31:28] pepega to use it and it [ __ ] some teams
[03:31:30] over but like with a lot of with some
[03:31:32] characters it's like
[03:31:36] insane anyways um are the new artifacts
[03:31:39] that's good not like the arino one's
[03:31:41] insane for
[03:31:42] arino um
[03:31:45] and the but the the burning set is
[03:31:47] [ __ ] burning so it's like burning but
[03:31:50] also so this is what I was thinking of
[03:31:52] for like when I was making the duuk out
[03:31:53] I was like should I mention it and I was
[03:31:55] looking at it I looked it up uh what is
[03:31:56] it called I can pull up their Twitter I
[03:31:58] think it's on their [ __ ] Twitter um
[03:32:01] genin
[03:32:02] impact I was looking at
[03:32:04] it I was looking at it and
[03:32:09] um it's 50% damage review one of my
[03:32:13] characters preferably new vet born
[03:32:16] man than like 1,00 bits okay sure but
[03:32:18] let me do this first so I was looking at
[03:32:20] it 50% damage and 18% attack which is a
[03:32:23] lot right it's a lot of stats but also
[03:32:26] it's like if you're playing like a
[03:32:29] burning team like B like burn Vape with
[03:32:32] like the Luke you're also running finina
[03:32:34] so you can also go marose and then not
[03:32:36] have to farm the set and Mar gives you
[03:32:39] effectively 72 crit damage right 36 crit
[03:32:42] rate effectively 72 crit damage and
[03:32:44] normal and charge attack damage which
[03:32:46] doesn't matter for duug matters for some
[03:32:47] characters but basically 72 CR like crit
[03:32:49] value for
[03:32:51] free whereas this gives you 50% damage
[03:32:55] which is different but still and 18%
[03:32:57] attack so it's like even if it would be
[03:32:59] better for you it's like does it really
[03:33:02] matter if you can just Farm Magi so yeah
[03:33:07] I don't
[03:33:08] know also lowkey burning teams
[03:33:12] especially if you're burgeoning can
[03:33:14] arguably run Mar even without finina it
[03:33:16] won't be consistent but I feel like
[03:33:18] those teams you kind of self damage
[03:33:19] yourself a lot like you [ __ ] burn
[03:33:22] [ __ ] burgeon your own character and
[03:33:23] you constantly take damage to where you
[03:33:25] can actually run those sets or
[03:33:28] Vermillion
[03:33:29] true so um I don't really like like I
[03:33:33] think it
[03:33:34] like it's worded like I don't
[03:33:38] know it's usable if you're burning but
[03:33:42] yeah
[03:33:46] MH needs finina but you can't use
[03:33:48] healers okay that is the most chatting
[03:33:51] comment I've ever seen none of the words
[03:33:53] you just wrote made
[03:33:57] sense
[03:34:05] anyways wait let me do this uh nlet
[03:34:10] review gan maxer gan maxing
[03:34:21] Jean
[03:34:24] 631 boom boom boom boom boom
[03:34:28] boom time to say bye
[03:34:35] boom they said free to play do we think
[03:34:38] that's
[03:34:38] cope I
[03:34:41] mean
[03:34:43] uh yeah okay I mean
[03:34:46] yeah all right okay yeah nice try buddy
[03:34:48] okay that's that's a lie uh so C6 net
[03:34:52] to crowned
[03:34:55] once for
[03:34:59] Mar that's a good flower all the sub
[03:35:01] stats are useful very good
[03:35:03] flower very good
[03:35:05] Sands [ __ ] you for the Sands actually
[03:35:09] feather um a lot of HP it's good I will
[03:35:13] say uh to the stat efficiency glazers if
[03:35:17] I see more ER I'm going to get mad at
[03:35:19] you because you have a [ __ ] toome and
[03:35:21] your C6 which I can't remember every
[03:35:22] single one but I'm sure it [ __ ]
[03:35:24] healths but you also have toome so you
[03:35:26] don't actually need that much more ER
[03:35:27] anyways goblet that's good
[03:35:30] ciret good HP crit
[03:35:34] damage yeah good enough for
[03:35:36] that wait how much HP do you have
[03:35:40] 35 lowkey the optimizer might tell you
[03:35:42] to go [ __ ] HP circlet but it's pretty
[03:35:48] cracked overcapped it doesn't really
[03:35:52] matter like 36 plus 64 [ __ ]
[03:36:01] 100 yeah yeah you you definitely
[03:36:03] like won't need that much ER in practice
[03:36:06] but it's not like bad it's fine
[03:36:16] yo what if I do one Abyss Run for the
[03:36:18] boys at home no that's [ __ ] dumb why
[03:36:19] would I do that damn I want to rank all
[03:36:22] the domains I mean I guess I know what
[03:36:23] the next one is wait I could just do it
[03:36:25] before it's out cuz I [ __ ] know what
[03:36:27] it's going to be like it's not like we
[03:36:28] don't know what it is but then when is
[03:36:30] it going to get uploaded I don't want to
[03:36:31] get uploaded in like [ __ ] four years
[03:37:00] woo I just got jingly you congrats make
[03:37:03] it a tww video instead of main or it'll
[03:37:04] be
[03:37:05] outdated okay true but I lowkey think
[03:37:08] marai is not doing anything until the
[03:37:10] arlino video so I could just give it to
[03:37:13] him and then he like makes it and then
[03:37:14] GG
[03:37:23] the resin went woke they made it trans
[03:37:25] the Liberals are crazy what are you
[03:37:28] talking about transient
[03:37:33] resin I actually
[03:37:35] can't what's your favorite TF comp I
[03:37:38] don't even know I just fast nine
[03:37:52] I'll use it though

[03:39:36] IMO turn off face cam for vid question
[03:39:39] mark
[03:39:54] okay I think I have my opinions
[03:40:19] tier maker moment is there even a
[03:40:28] [ __ ] oh wait there is one but it's
[03:40:31] 4.0 updated so it doesn't have the new
[03:40:37] ones it's missing two sets
[03:40:53] add them
[03:40:55] yourself wait you think I know how to do
[03:40:57] that I got this i got
[03:40:59] this
[03:41:08] um all wait wait
[03:41:43] dude this looks disgusting
[03:42:01] I always feel like somebody want me
[03:42:18] bro this one doesn't
[03:42:29] even what do I
[03:42:39] do Wiki
[03:42:53] um here use this one I think under
[03:42:58] B here use this one no one's lowkey
[03:43:02] uglier
[03:43:17] we can't is goed yeah it
[03:43:21] is all right maybe let's just do
[03:43:24] it do you know why dwe is trending it
[03:43:27] just memes it was like Hoover creater
[03:43:29] dwe confirms and then a bunch of random
[03:43:37] [ __ ] I confirm and stuff
[03:43:52] okay
[03:43:53] anyways real no
[03:43:56] way no
[03:43:58] way all right is it
[03:44:02] time should we be in
[03:44:05] uh should I should I go through my
[03:44:07] knowledge
[03:44:10] Bank all right it's time let's do
[03:44:13] it it's time
[03:44:28] all right you know what time it
[03:44:32] is ready
[03:44:38] ready turn off freaking chat on screen
[03:44:42] for video
[03:44:43] then I mean okay realistically it'll be
[03:44:46] second channeled but like even if it's
[03:44:47] main Channel like it's fine it's not
[03:44:49] that
[03:44:55] serious there's a higher likelihood to
[03:44:57] get second channeled than main channeled
[03:44:59] but like realistically as long as the
[03:45:01] information isn't dog [ __ ] it doesn't
[03:45:02] really
[03:45:06] matter I would play background music but
[03:45:08] apparently it goes to the recording so I
[03:45:12] won't all right anyways
[03:45:15] we're going to review no we're not going
[03:45:16] to review we're going to rank every
[03:45:19] domain efficiency wise which one should
[03:45:21] you be farming and which one should you
[03:45:22] be laughed at for farming before I start
[03:45:26] important disclaimer that you should
[03:45:27] know is that the earlier sets are added
[03:45:30] to strong box like as new regions come
[03:45:33] out so right now we have the strong
[03:45:34] boxes for like the first few regions up
[03:45:36] until like embl or husk and ocean H clam
[03:45:39] which makes farming the early sets not
[03:45:41] necessarily bad but uh there's an easier
[03:45:45] way to do it where you don't need to
[03:45:46] spend resin in the strong box if only
[03:45:48] one set is good and the other one's bad
[03:45:49] so for example in the past I would say
[03:45:52] hey verd descent is needed you really
[03:45:54] want this set you still do so you would
[03:45:56] farm this domain but now if you farm
[03:45:58] this domain you might also get maidens
[03:45:59] which is useless which makes an
[03:46:01] otherwise good sort of domain now bad
[03:46:04] with one good set that you would strong
[03:46:05] box okay okay so we're going to rank
[03:46:08] these in tier so you know what the farm
[03:46:09] what I think I'm going to do is rename
[03:46:11] these tiers as like a one set is good or
[03:46:13] something I actually should probably
[03:46:15] think about this maybe we just keep it s
[03:46:16] and a uh yeah it needs an F tier for
[03:46:20] sure uh let's add a
[03:46:22] tier cuz like it could have a tier
[03:46:24] that's like good but strong boxable or
[03:46:26] some [ __ ] I don't know how to like words
[03:46:29] you know like I'm thinking of something
[03:46:31] but I don't know how to say
[03:46:36] it
[03:46:40] words what color should F be
[03:46:48] add a strong box at tier yeah okay
[03:46:52] there's going to be okay
[03:46:56] s do
[03:46:58] these
[03:46:59] a maybe do
[03:47:05] these
[03:47:08] b
[03:47:10] um
[03:47:13] Niche Maybe good for you wait no but I
[03:47:17] put maybe it's like a probably we'll do
[03:47:20] probably okay s is everyone should do a
[03:47:23] is wait wait let me let me I'll recap
[03:47:25] after I do them all and then C just
[03:47:28] strong box
[03:47:30] it strong box oh my God the x
[03:47:40] is wait should I delete D then it
[03:47:43] doesn't need a d if there C is just
[03:47:44] strong box
[03:47:46] it s is like
[03:47:53] yeah D is cob tier but then what is
[03:47:56] that's f as
[03:48:00] well but also the thing is is like the
[03:48:02] just strong box it could be said for C
[03:48:04] tier domains and D like f tier domains
[03:48:06] for example like I would strongbox Petra
[03:48:09] if you're playing like Petra Jang Lee
[03:48:11] but this domain is f for sure like
[03:48:13] you're not farming this but
[03:48:15] but you might want a you might want
[03:48:18] Petra for like one character so it's not
[03:48:20] like it's strong box but it's not like
[03:48:22] see it's like
[03:48:26] here is there I don't think there's a
[03:48:28] single domain where both sets are
[03:48:30] useless I mean okay arguably this if
[03:48:33] you're not playing like EO
[03:48:36] but
[03:48:39] uh
[03:48:41] yeah I mean Vermillion
[03:48:46] yo
[03:48:52] chill Petra sling you farm in strong box
[03:48:55] you can get a
[03:48:58] set yeah you could just go and do it but
[03:49:00] you can also just STW MOX a little bit
[03:49:02] cuz you don't really care about the
[03:49:03] stats on it like it's okay if my Jang Le
[03:49:05] is lower HP if I just want the main like
[03:49:07] if you're trying to mmax with Petra you
[03:49:09] probably don't need to tank your Shield
[03:49:11] well maybe you do if you're playing I
[03:49:12] never let
[03:49:15] vasha and
[03:49:17] nymph yeah vasha and nymph are
[03:49:20] interesting no I mean you don't keep
[03:49:22] strong box it you do it once yeah that
[03:49:25] is
[03:49:26] true Okay C will be just strong box it D
[03:49:28] will be
[03:49:32] cope honestly I think no D tier I think
[03:49:35] it's sa a b CF no we need a d do we need
[03:49:38] a d yeah we need a d d is cope f is
[03:49:42] only once at
[03:49:49] most wait is anything let me Mental Math
[03:49:52] this really
[03:49:53] fast is anything going to go in D
[03:49:56] because I feel like if you're D you're
[03:49:57] maybe F like let's say I do
[03:50:01] this this is probably
[03:50:04] here what would go here nothing would go
[03:50:07] I guess
[03:50:12] like yeah loky do
[03:50:16] f is avoid
[03:50:22] avoid avoid for most
[03:50:29] people like honestly Vermilion is
[03:50:31] probably cope but I would probably put
[03:50:33] it
[03:50:34] here okay okay okay I'm not going to get
[03:50:36] too ahead of myself I'm not going to get
[03:50:38] too ahead of myself myself I'm not going
[03:50:40] to do myself
[03:50:47] okay I think I'm ready um boom boom boom
[03:50:51] boom boom boom so what if it's one set
[03:50:53] is really good and the other one is
[03:50:54] really [ __ ] it'll probably be in just
[03:50:56] strong MOX it but what's better text
[03:50:58] just strong boxit or one set good one
[03:51:00] bad like one good one bad I guess that
[03:51:02] would just be just strong boox
[03:51:05] it one good set
[03:51:09] only this is too much text no [ __ ] it
[03:51:11] [ __ ] it [ __ ] it you'll know what I'm
[03:51:12] saying
[03:51:36] whatever there's a lot of text it's
[03:51:38] fine okay I made the tear I'll probably
[03:51:41] just fast forward from the intro I made
[03:51:42] the tear here's what it is s is you
[03:51:44] should Farm domains absolutely a is like
[03:51:46] everyone a is like you probably should B
[03:51:49] is Niche but it might be good for you
[03:51:51] depending on who you play so you know it
[03:51:52] depends C is also technically Niche but
[03:51:55] it's going to be for uh basically
[03:51:57] domains with one good set and the other
[03:51:59] one that's bad um it's also the just
[03:52:03] strong box at tier for example one's
[03:52:04] really good one's really bad you just
[03:52:06] strong box the good one you never see
[03:52:07] the bad one the the alternative is it's
[03:52:09] a newer set that you can't strong box
[03:52:11] right but one of them's good one of them
[03:52:13] is bad so like like let's say I want AR
[03:52:15] Lino set but the burning set I don't
[03:52:17] want I would strong box AR linos so it
[03:52:20] might be there no spoilers but I can't
[03:52:23] cuz it's not out so I have to farm the
[03:52:25] domain so it's like it might actually go
[03:52:27] up to Niche cuz the strong box is out
[03:52:28] but we're not spoiling that yet we're
[03:52:30] not getting there we're not getting
[03:52:30] there we're not getting there um we're
[03:52:32] not spawning that
[03:52:33] yet we're not spawning that yet um and
[03:52:37] then there's cop tier which is like you
[03:52:39] probably shouldn't do it and then F tier
[03:52:40] which is don't do it I don't know if we
[03:52:42] need dnf we might delete one but for now
[03:52:44] this is what it
[03:52:45] is okay o okay let's start in game the
[03:52:50] first one Midsummer Courtyard I have
[03:52:52] spent many summers in this
[03:52:56] Courtyard uh okay fun fact about this
[03:52:59] domain I think thundering Fury is really
[03:53:01] good I I really like thundering Fury not
[03:53:03] on everyone not everyone needs it but
[03:53:05] for like kaching um it's amazing for
[03:53:07] like Soo it gives you a lot of energy
[03:53:09] spam you can basically spam your skill
[03:53:11] it's good in general even like IO can
[03:53:12] use it it's just good in Electro team
[03:53:14] not always like beta will go emblem
[03:53:16] Ryden will go emblem but it it can be
[03:53:19] good uh even the two piece is fine now
[03:53:21] this domain I think used to be efficient
[03:53:23] because you could thunder so there
[03:53:25] certain characters for example C6 uh
[03:53:27] official or some Electro characters in
[03:53:30] Electro teams or characters in Electro
[03:53:31] teams where enemies are always electrode
[03:53:33] you could use both uh sets the problem
[03:53:36] is now fishell got a much better set
[03:53:38] that we're going to talk about so a lot
[03:53:41] of the times you might run thundering
[03:53:42] fury on someone but then your other
[03:53:43] character won't really want to run the
[03:53:45] other set your y Miko your official now
[03:53:48] will want okay spoilers uh like the the
[03:53:51] skill buffing set a lot more than
[03:53:53] they're going to want thunder sother so
[03:53:55] I used to say farm this but now I think
[03:53:57] it's just strongbox tier because
[03:53:58] thundering Fury is good but the other
[03:54:00] one's not
[03:54:01] great
[03:54:04] um you could I mean I think it's just
[03:54:07] strongbox at tier uh but in my heart
[03:54:10] it's B tier should I reward this
[03:54:12] probably not I think it's just here
[03:54:15] it's probably just
[03:54:17] here given the logic of the tearers it's
[03:54:19] here because you don't want you're not
[03:54:20] going to strongo thunder Suther like I
[03:54:22] don't see someone using Thunder sother
[03:54:25] past oh I just got lucky and I have good
[03:54:26] sub stats cuz I used to use it a lot I
[03:54:28] used to have thunder my official but for
[03:54:30] now it's just thundering Fury is really
[03:54:32] good but you should just strongbox it
[03:54:33] it's an old set you can strong box it
[03:54:35] you're
[03:54:35] good
[03:54:37] uh next is verid descent maidens okay I
[03:54:42] used this example earlier verid descent
[03:54:44] is
[03:54:44] the core support set that everyone
[03:54:46] should have on their anemo characters
[03:54:48] this set is broken anemo characters
[03:54:50] supports are broken you got a huge buff
[03:54:53] it's amazing everyone should have this
[03:54:54] on their account it's even if it's like
[03:54:56] a okay lowkey I used to run like a
[03:54:58] fourar set on my low investment sucr she
[03:55:00] did no damage but she debuffed the
[03:55:01] enemies and I cleared floor 12 but
[03:55:05] obviously you want a good set if you can
[03:55:06] it's good on Kazo it's good on Su it's
[03:55:07] good on venti it's got on everyone uh
[03:55:09] but Maiden sucks Maiden is terrible it
[03:55:11] gives you a bit more healing technically
[03:55:13] if you're playing a bad healer with
[03:55:15] finina you can use it maybe early game
[03:55:18] you can but it's it's never optimal like
[03:55:20] it's almost never what you want to get
[03:55:22] so I don't recommend touching this
[03:55:24] domain because of this verd descent
[03:55:26] broken Maiden terrible just strong box
[03:55:29] it yeah old sets you're going to notice
[03:55:30] that Trend C tier but like if we're
[03:55:33] ranking the sets individually veres is
[03:55:35] like ssss o Gage uh domain of guun yeah
[03:55:40] more like domain of garbage uh f here
[03:55:44] okay with that said I like Petra I think
[03:55:47] Petra is underrated in certain teams for
[03:55:49] example you're playing Jang Le with like
[03:55:50] nevet you could get a hydr crystal 35%
[03:55:53] Hydro damage bonus if you pick it up
[03:55:54] actually good to have a set on your
[03:55:55] account with that in mind because it's a
[03:55:58] supportive set and its Niche not only do
[03:56:01] most people not need it for most people
[03:56:03] you can just ignore this um but also
[03:56:06] even if you do need it it's okay if your
[03:56:07] sub stat suck like I have a plus zero
[03:56:09] Petra feather as my only Petra feather
[03:56:12] on my Jong Lee but it's fine cuz who
[03:56:14] cares myi has a bit less HP yeah his
[03:56:16] shield will be a bit weaker but I'm
[03:56:17] already clearing I don't need the a
[03:56:19] little bit of like mid Max so even if
[03:56:21] you want it you don't need to like turbo
[03:56:23] Farm it so viable set but I think it's
[03:56:26] an avoid like I don't think you ever set
[03:56:28] foot in this domain you shouldn't know
[03:56:29] that there's a ruin hunter in that
[03:56:31] domain I know uh bide is is AR it's
[03:56:35] outdated it's archaic it's viable with
[03:56:38] characters that are shielded like
[03:56:40] shielded yoia can use it it's like
[03:56:42] viable but it's never the best there's a
[03:56:44] few characters that can use it I've
[03:56:47] experimented with it don't recommend it
[03:56:49] uh there's better
[03:56:52] sets uh hidden place of zoo formula why
[03:56:56] did I read it like that the Crimson
[03:56:58] witch domain oh this was my home this
[03:57:00] and viridescent back in the day these
[03:57:02] were my
[03:57:03] homes um yeah if you know you know this
[03:57:07] is a I mean Crimson Witch is great for a
[03:57:09] lot of characters um the good thing is a
[03:57:11] lot of those power characters that love
[03:57:13] Crimson witch got Alternatives as well
[03:57:15] it's a classic domain it is because lava
[03:57:17] Walker makes you cry um but okay here's
[03:57:20] the thing Crimson witch really good set
[03:57:22] made for duuke given how it works but
[03:57:24] it's also great on other pyros Hut or
[03:57:26] basically any pyro character can make
[03:57:28] use of the set get a lot of pyro damage
[03:57:30] bonus increase the reaction damage it's
[03:57:32] good lava Walker is only good for like
[03:57:34] mono pyro if the enemies are always
[03:57:35] afflicted by pyro it's fine it's 35%
[03:57:38] damage it's not useless but personally I
[03:57:41] like never used it ever because there's
[03:57:43] usually either a better option or I
[03:57:45] don't really want to spend time grinding
[03:57:47] for this Set uh well yeah cuz it's only
[03:57:50] for like one team like if I'm playing
[03:57:51] Shang Ling and mono pyro I don't want to
[03:57:52] remove her emblem and even then emblem
[03:57:54] is usually better because you get er and
[03:57:55] then even more than 35% damage if you're
[03:57:57] going high ER which you are on Shang
[03:57:59] Ling maybe not like clear or something
[03:58:01] but you get my point anyways it's viable
[03:58:04] but it's niche and Crimson Witch is
[03:58:05] really good but it's strong boxable and
[03:58:09] yeah even with like even those
[03:58:10] characters that I was naming there's
[03:58:11] better options Shang Ling's going emblem
[03:58:13] even l he's going Mari chose which is
[03:58:16] we'll get there soon but just better so
[03:58:20] even when you're playing mopyro it's
[03:58:22] only a oh I have it because I farm
[03:58:24] Crimson witch so it's like usable but
[03:58:26] it's not good uh and Crimson Witch is a
[03:58:29] really good set but even the characters
[03:58:31] that used to just need it like duuke you
[03:58:32] would always go four piece now have
[03:58:34] Alternatives you can go Guild the dreams
[03:58:36] and you can go Mar chose if you're
[03:58:37] running fora so it's like less needed
[03:58:40] and because of that um
[03:58:45] because lava Walker is viable I was
[03:58:46] debating putting it B but I don't think
[03:58:48] so because you could say the same about
[03:58:49] thunder Soother right so I think it's C
[03:58:51] next to this I think these two are like
[03:58:53] similar Crimson witch and thundering
[03:58:55] Fury are really good but you're just
[03:58:56] going to strongbox it
[03:58:58] right uh and it's an old set so
[03:59:03] yeah clear pool and Mountain
[03:59:08] Cavern what is this blood stain no blast
[03:59:11] oh yeah okay strong box now okay there's
[03:59:15] also I have to disclose if you need like
[03:59:17] every set you're a new player um I'm
[03:59:20] still the things that are in CER like
[03:59:23] you could say strong box it to any set
[03:59:25] that's in the strong box if you only
[03:59:26] need the one set but I assume a lot of
[03:59:27] people watching this are going to need a
[03:59:28] lot of sets that's when the distinction
[03:59:31] between like b c and d is going to come
[03:59:32] because like all of these sets are about
[03:59:34] as efficient to like Farm if you need to
[03:59:37] I I would say this one's less um because
[03:59:41] maidens is not usable
[03:59:44] honestly maybe this is
[03:59:46] cope dude I think this might be
[03:59:51] cope cuz like I could see a newer player
[03:59:54] using thundering Thunder Soo if you
[03:59:56] needed on official I could see a newer
[03:59:58] player using lava Walker but like
[03:59:59] maidens is so bad but Viv is so good
[04:00:03] yeah
[04:00:05] okay
[04:00:07] yeah Okay and like I wouldn't yeah okay
[04:00:10] let me rephrase that okay cut that out
[04:00:12] Mari let me rephrase this okay
[04:00:15] I could see new players like if you need
[04:00:17] every domain right you you're like okay
[04:00:18] all these sets I want a strong box I
[04:00:21] would recommend farming some of the
[04:00:22] newer sets that are high value and then
[04:00:24] strong boxing whichever ones you need
[04:00:25] more for example ver has and Venter
[04:00:26] maybe thundering so thundering Fury or
[04:00:29] Crimson witch if you need but there's
[04:00:31] Alternatives we'll get into that
[04:00:33] um if you need a lot of them there's C
[04:00:36] because it's not like bad to enter the
[04:00:38] domain like you can use lava Walker it's
[04:00:40] just never going to be like Optimal to
[04:00:43] do so
[04:00:44] and yeah the same with v like VV maidens
[04:00:46] is like VV is so good but maidens is so
[04:00:48] bad so it's like
[04:00:51] yeah it balances out okay this domain uh
[04:00:54] Blood Stained and nblast nblast is great
[04:00:56] you need on every account and this is
[04:00:58] one of the few sets where also like
[04:01:00] let's say you're playing a he like a a
[04:01:02] support or healer that's not doing
[04:01:03] damage even if like your sub like your
[04:01:05] four star or your substats are really
[04:01:06] bad you want ER usually it's still going
[04:01:09] to give your team attack like at worst
[04:01:11] you're getting attack on your team as
[04:01:12] long as you're bursting so it's it's
[04:01:13] it's always a really good support set to
[04:01:15] have uh Blood Stained is usually useless
[04:01:18] it's okay for physical attackers mainly
[04:01:20] the two-piece the four piece gives you
[04:01:22] stamina reduction which like when you
[04:01:24] like your charge attack stamina cost it
[04:01:26] used to be for physical kaching that was
[04:01:28] it uh yeah not recommended to farm uh I
[04:01:32] use the two-piece on my Ula that's it
[04:01:34] and for nobless oblig this is amazing
[04:01:37] good really really good support set so
[04:01:40] it's the same as VV basically whereas
[04:01:42] you want it on account but you don't
[04:01:44] want to farm the other set if you're a
[04:01:47] physical player and you can use like
[04:01:49] twopiece sub stats sure but like still C
[04:01:51] tier it's the Box tier this is the
[04:01:53] strong box tier you're going to notice
[04:01:54] this we're going in order you might
[04:01:56] notice this at the start now something
[04:01:58] that might not be strong box tier that
[04:02:00] is strong boxable is this one blizzard
[04:02:02] Strayer and heart of death a lot of
[04:02:05] people might only need one and you can
[04:02:07] strong box strong box that one but if
[04:02:09] you need both this might actually be
[04:02:10] worth farming so blizzard stayer is like
[04:02:13] broken it's really good for any freeze
[04:02:14] character all of them Kaa rosar why am I
[04:02:17] starting with Kaa aaka guu Kaa Rosaria
[04:02:21] any cryo that's freezing this set
[04:02:23] amazing really good I will say that
[04:02:26] oddly enough Mari chose is still fine
[04:02:28] especially against bosses that can't be
[04:02:29] frozen you get 36 crit raate from that
[04:02:31] set this one gives you 40 plus Crow
[04:02:33] damage bonus which usually makes it just
[04:02:35] better if you're freezing
[04:02:37] but if you're running fre m is always
[04:02:40] anyways we'll get there but blizzard is
[04:02:42] a really good set for freeze characters
[04:02:43] it's amazing
[04:02:44] um freeze kind of gets nerfed sometimes
[04:02:47] when the abyss is just like no you can't
[04:02:49] freeze me boss boss boss or you need
[04:02:51] this element so you know it is what it
[04:02:53] is but for cryo characters in general
[04:02:55] usually you're farming the set at least
[04:02:56] the two-piece uh even the four piece is
[04:02:58] good though cuz even if you're not
[04:03:00] freezing and you're mono crying it's 20%
[04:03:01] crit rate stop spoiling I'm sorry that
[04:03:04] domain's too good I'm sorry it's in my
[04:03:06] head rent free we should have started
[04:03:08] with it uh yeah freeze isn't the most
[04:03:10] meta now but it's still a broken
[04:03:12] reaction when it works so this is good
[04:03:13] set and then hearted dep is also good uh
[04:03:16] hard of depth also has Alternatives
[04:03:18] though like even someone like child it's
[04:03:19] like you can use harded depth you can
[04:03:21] use four piece you can use two-piece you
[04:03:23] can use the other sets that we'll get
[04:03:25] into later a lot of hydro characters
[04:03:27] that can use hard depth Ayo as well can
[04:03:29] use like eight other sets so it's never
[04:03:31] like
[04:03:32] needed um and I would if you're I
[04:03:34] usually wouldn't recommend like strong
[04:03:35] boxing this one but if you want blizzard
[04:03:38] and you also have a hydro character you
[04:03:39] can build then you can use this as like
[04:03:41] a substat set and it's not bad um so I
[04:03:44] think this domain's decent I think it's
[04:03:46] B tier
[04:03:48] H it's b or a probably B because I think
[04:03:51] it's more on the niche end You could
[04:03:52] argue a actually it might be a wait let
[04:03:54] me think how Niche is cryo who's
[04:03:58] playing aaka G let me look at the
[04:04:01] character
[04:04:03] list the the Hydra one's definitely
[04:04:05] Niche the cry one's Niche to cryo but is
[04:04:09] cryo more Universal than I think wait
[04:04:12] oops character
[04:04:18] archive yeah
[04:04:20] okay yeah I agree I I think it's it used
[04:04:24] to be a I think it's B now and you can
[04:04:25] also STW box if you need one cuz in the
[04:04:28] past it's like if you need only one it
[04:04:29] doesn't feel bad to get the other but
[04:04:32] now it doesn't really feel bad either
[04:04:33] but you might have Alternatives that you
[04:04:35] already have farmed so yeah B and also
[04:04:37] given how like the the teams kind of got
[04:04:39] changed or the characters that use those
[04:04:41] sets got changed by The Meta okay back
[04:04:45] to
[04:04:46] artifacts um oh God I have to resc
[04:04:48] scroll
[04:04:50] everything whoa okay milth domain woo
[04:04:56] milth and pale flame okay pale flame is
[04:04:57] used on physical carries uh if you play
[04:05:00] Ula cool if you don't no one cares about
[04:05:02] this uh uh set that's not true there's
[04:05:04] other physical characters but for the
[04:05:05] most part very Niche physical set the
[04:05:08] really good one is MTH this was one of
[04:05:10] the happiest one of my happiest uh uh uh
[04:05:13] uh times artifact farming wise was
[04:05:16] seeing milth go to the strongbox because
[04:05:18] now I don't need to get a physical set
[04:05:21] if I'm not playing physical characters
[04:05:22] milth is amazing not for everyone not
[04:05:24] even for every account but if you're
[04:05:26] playing like Jang Lee you're playing
[04:05:27] maybe kokomi you're playing anyone that
[04:05:30] does off field damage uh that's a
[04:05:32] support like not like a primary damage
[04:05:34] dealer like it's viable on ficial but I
[04:05:35] don't recommend it usually because you
[04:05:37] want her to do damage but a lot of like
[04:05:38] supports can use this provided their
[04:05:41] skill hits enemies from off field even
[04:05:42] like a C6 far on uh also the two-piece
[04:05:46] gives you HP which makes it good for
[04:05:47] someone like what's her name Neu cool
[04:05:51] pale flame very Niche so what does that
[04:05:53] mean it means it's the strongbox tier
[04:05:55] wow big surprise okay but milth is
[04:05:59] really good um and pale flame is Niche
[04:06:01] like if you're a physical player this
[04:06:03] goes up for you if you're a physical
[04:06:04] player you probably want pale flame and
[04:06:06] you might you probably want MTH on
[04:06:09] someone o
[04:06:12] Gage uh em reminescence okay this is a
[04:06:15] classic this is a classic this was like
[04:06:18] the S tier
[04:06:19] one I will say now it's strong boxable
[04:06:22] so you might be like hey I'll just Farm
[04:06:24] emblem uh in the strong box and I don't
[04:06:27] need to see reminescence with that said
[04:06:29] I think remance is still good because
[04:06:31] twopiece giving you 18% attack it's
[04:06:33] gotten more common than before a lot of
[04:06:36] sets do that now but it's good the
[04:06:38] two-piece you can use on literally
[04:06:39] anyone same with emblem two-piece
[04:06:41] because it's ER but the emblem four
[04:06:42] piece is like the most meta no not the
[04:06:45] most meta but one of the most meta sets
[04:06:47] just in general but it's mainly for like
[04:06:50] burst supports or burst DPSS someone
[04:06:52] like Ryden Shang Ling Singo yolon sh uh
[04:06:55] did they say Shang Ling already so many
[04:06:57] characters reminescence is like mid no
[04:07:01] it's not mid reminescence is let me say
[04:07:03] this again reminescence is two-piece is
[04:07:05] flexible reminescence is four piece is
[04:07:07] weird gives you damage but you lose
[04:07:09] energy it's not good on everyone but
[04:07:11] it's good on certain characters you can
[04:07:12] use it on Hut you can use it on y Mia
[04:07:14] it's especially good because uh you can
[04:07:16] see on Scara too rizzly there's a lot of
[04:07:18] characters that can use this as like
[04:07:19] their alternative set because it's
[04:07:22] efficient this is a domain that even
[04:07:24] though shimwa is often times there's a
[04:07:27] alternative that's either a bit better
[04:07:28] or sometimes a bit worse like you know
[04:07:30] yoia can use this four piece pretty well
[04:07:32] it's almost yeah it's rarely the best
[04:07:34] option if ever but what's nice is that
[04:07:37] you get it for free as you farm for one
[04:07:39] of the best sets in the game and so
[04:07:41] because of that I actually really like
[04:07:43] this domain yeah you could strong box
[04:07:45] emblem but you obviously can't strong
[04:07:47] box everything and if there's one domain
[04:07:49] that you I think of the domains that you
[04:07:52] can farm this is pretty
[04:07:55] efficient
[04:08:00] um let me think before I stier it
[04:08:03] because it might be a it's either High a
[04:08:05] or low s now let me think a
[04:08:07] little
[04:08:09] um if I see a new player enter this
[04:08:12] domain
[04:08:13] I don't think it's a bad thing and
[04:08:15] honestly even if we look at the other
[04:08:17] sets like if you don't have
[04:08:20] finina and you don't want to do this set
[04:08:22] and maybe you're not playing dendro
[04:08:24] there are very little domains that would
[04:08:26] recommend over it in fact I don't think
[04:08:27] there's any if you're not like there's
[04:08:29] the dendro efficient domain which we'll
[04:08:30] get into and there's the finina
[04:08:32] efficient domain and then it's probably
[04:08:34] emblem so I think it's s and uh I just
[04:08:38] don't like that it says do these but
[04:08:40] yeah I think this is a
[04:08:43] yeah another thing is emblem is needed
[04:08:45] on so many
[04:08:46] characters uh like with ver veredes and
[04:08:49] vener it's needed on like every anemo
[04:08:50] character but a lot of the times you
[04:08:51] need one two enemo supports uh well
[04:08:54] supports not DPSS but yeah with emblem
[04:08:57] though it's like you were probably
[04:08:58] playing a lot of the meta supports want
[04:09:00] emblem you're probably playing SRO
[04:09:01] you're probably playing Shang ling
[04:09:02] you're probably playing yolan you're
[04:09:03] probably playing maybe B maybe Ryden
[04:09:05] there's like so many there's other
[04:09:07] characters that can even use either the
[04:09:08] two-piece or the four piece just because
[04:09:10] right U Rosaria Kaa can use it just cuz
[04:09:13] they want ER and they do damage there's
[04:09:15] like newer like even fars on if you're
[04:09:17] not you don't need VV like there's a lot
[04:09:19] of characters that could just use
[04:09:21] it uh DEA true DEA can use it DEA can
[04:09:25] use it change it to recommend these okay
[04:09:29] yeah I'm going to change this
[04:09:31] to
[04:09:33] highly
[04:09:35] recommend oh my God the D is not even
[04:09:47] um
[04:09:49] s most
[04:09:53] efficient
[04:10:06] thoughts uh it's probably generally
[04:10:08] efficient no but that's too cringe I'm
[04:10:10] going to have a spine [ __ ] it if you're
[04:10:12] mad at embl being high like like look in
[04:10:14] a mirror but I you know reminescence is
[04:10:16] a little cope but it's it's a good set
[04:10:19] to get while you're farming for set that
[04:10:20] you need on like 20 characters like
[04:10:22] you're farming this so much that just
[04:10:24] constantly strong boxing it you might
[04:10:25] not have enough sets for all the
[04:10:27] characters if you're playing like strong
[04:10:29] or meta supports if you're not that's
[04:10:30] okay too but like in general it's just
[04:10:32] really good and this is a good
[04:10:34] alternative that like you're not going
[04:10:35] to be mad
[04:10:38] about okay and yeah the two-piece is
[04:10:40] always good
[04:10:51] okay I I I agree with myself it's either
[04:10:54] low s or high a but there's in my mind
[04:10:56] right now there's two sets that are
[04:10:57] better than it so should there only be
[04:11:00] two sets in s I'm down for three but
[04:11:03] we'll see we we'll see when we get there
[04:11:04] we might move
[04:11:05] it slumbering Court husk and ocean hued
[04:11:10] clam I don't even like you
[04:11:15] cope okay okay okay let me be real here
[04:11:17] clam is O is not bad you can onfield it
[04:11:20] with kokomi you can get a bit more
[04:11:23] healing if you're playing like uh finina
[04:11:26] need a bit more you can get a bit of D
[04:11:28] like a bubble damage from like Chi-Chi
[04:11:30] you can do clam cave that's a that's a
[04:11:33] thing husk is good for EO like it's the
[04:11:36] best in Saw Set for some Gio right it
[04:11:39] can be good on really good on albo as
[04:11:40] well if you can use the defense the
[04:11:42] difference between husk and golden troop
[04:11:44] on on albo depends on like how much
[04:11:47] defense and Goro and stuff um so they're
[04:11:49] both viable it's really good on EO but
[04:11:52] one Geo is copium two a lot of the
[04:11:55] healers that can use this either have
[04:11:57] other sets or are copium like Ki is
[04:11:59] really good but she has like 20 sets she
[04:12:00] can use um so I'm not a big fan isn't
[04:12:05] ocean Clan best in for KI not always it
[04:12:08] can be it's great on field but there's
[04:12:09] also other Hydro sets you can use on
[04:12:11] field and a lot of times that's support
[04:12:13] you're running like milth or you can run
[04:12:15] deepwood memories or you're playing
[04:12:16] Bloom with uh either flop or golden
[04:12:19] dreams golden dreams gilded troop gild
[04:12:21] the dreams that's what it's called
[04:12:23] so yeah I I think like yeah you can Farm
[04:12:27] it for kakom if you want but I wouldn't
[04:12:29] ever setep foot in the domain unless you
[04:12:31] also want Gio and then the worst part is
[04:12:33] what if you want Gio you're an eain you
[04:12:35] probably don't even want clam like the
[04:12:37] the overlap of people that want husk and
[04:12:39] that want ocean H clam is like very slim
[04:12:41] like it's rare that you want both both
[04:12:44] even if you're an eain just strongbox it
[04:12:46] but if you're a eain that also wants
[04:12:48] clan for healer then you can go into it
[04:12:50] or vice versa so I'm going to put in cop
[04:12:51] tier it's not useless but it's not I
[04:12:53] wouldn't even put it
[04:12:56] here cuz like even in the strong boxable
[04:12:59] domains I think these are all better
[04:13:00] ones that like most accounts would need
[04:13:02] most accounts want VV most accounts want
[04:13:03] nobless uh most accounts want milth
[04:13:06] Crimson witch and thundering Fury are a
[04:13:08] bit more Niche but they're like insane
[04:13:10] for the characters that can use them
[04:13:11] this one is like a lot less common to
[04:13:14] need and a lot less
[04:13:15] meta
[04:13:17] anyways 2B defense uh subat can be
[04:13:20] viable for like defense characters and
[04:13:22] we're going to get more of them so yeah
[04:13:26] the Lost Valley more like the Lost resin
[04:13:29] Vermilion and Echo if you farm this
[04:13:31] domain please seek help I farm this
[04:13:35] domain I should seek help I don't
[04:13:37] actually mean that
[04:13:39] it's in my opinion one of the least
[04:13:42] efficient sets uh domains so
[04:13:45] Vermilion is best in slot on Shia
[04:13:48] situationally it's usually best in slot
[04:13:50] but with shenyun Mari can be better but
[04:13:54] I don't want to get into it it depends
[04:13:55] if you have a crit rate weapon allar
[04:13:57] you're going to overcap on crit rate so
[04:13:58] Vermillion still usually recommended but
[04:13:59] if you only get crit damage sub stats
[04:14:01] and can dodge crit rate Mai can be
[04:14:03] better than Vermillion but if you're not
[04:14:04] running Shen Yun then Vermillion can be
[04:14:06] better it just depends on a lot of
[04:14:07] things so even though Vermilion is like
[04:14:10] the go-to set for Shia and my favorite
[04:14:12] set for xia and what I recommend for
[04:14:14] Shia if you're strong boxing it cool
[04:14:17] however it's not more efficient to farm
[04:14:18] than M I don't recommend far I say I
[04:14:21] recommend it on Shia that's only if
[04:14:22] we're talking like turbo min max it
[04:14:24] doesn't matter in terms of resin
[04:14:25] efficiency I wouldn't recommend setting
[04:14:28] foot in this domain the only time you
[04:14:30] can is if you want this for Shia and you
[04:14:32] also want Echo but Echo is another thing
[04:14:36] in it of itself so Echo not only is
[04:14:38] really Niche cuz it's only for normal
[04:14:40] attackers but also it's like Ping
[04:14:42] dependent it doesn't work properly
[04:14:44] sometimes and I just don't like it now
[04:14:46] the only good like the main good thing
[04:14:48] about this domain is that both two
[04:14:50] pieces give attack perc so at least
[04:14:52] that's viable however I don't recommend
[04:14:54] it okay I take it from me I've spent
[04:14:57] probably 150,000 resin here I can tell
[04:14:59] you I can tell you that it wasn't
[04:15:01] efficient I can be honest hey you
[04:15:04] shouldn't do that and now that was
[04:15:06] before a lot of the new sets came out
[04:15:08] now Shia has another set he can use so
[04:15:10] even for Shia Mains I don't really
[04:15:11] recommend it
[04:15:13] um this set also has a niche where if
[04:15:16] you're a character that's draining HP or
[04:15:18] running with finina and you're using
[04:15:19] your burst a lot you get a lot of attack
[04:15:21] so it's viable but as you're about to
[04:15:24] see there's also a set hinted Mar that
[04:15:28] just gives you more stats in general for
[04:15:30] most characters because you're getting
[04:15:31] crit instead of attack which would just
[04:15:32] be
[04:15:33] better eeko is like Ayo set and a viable
[04:15:37] for normal
[04:15:39] attackers like for certain normal
[04:15:41] attackers okay but it's like it's not
[04:15:45] the best
[04:15:47] option and so because of that I don't
[04:15:49] recommend it I don't recommend this
[04:15:51] domain I think it is cope I think it is
[04:15:53] cop tier um like if you're playing Shia
[04:15:57] you either have Alternatives or you you
[04:16:00] just strong box like strong box like the
[04:16:02] reason I said I can recommend Vermillion
[04:16:03] is because you can strong box it it's
[04:16:04] actually a pretty good strongbox set but
[04:16:07] I don't even think it's here because
[04:16:08] there's an alternative and only like one
[04:16:10] character use a Vermillion you can like
[04:16:12] technically use it on like Linny but you
[04:16:14] shouldn't because there's better same
[04:16:16] with gaming so I don't think it's like
[04:16:18] as good as these because thundering Fury
[04:16:20] I highly recommend for like Soo kaching
[04:16:22] you kind of need you don't need it for
[04:16:23] Soo but I don't like playing djo kaching
[04:16:25] without it I think it's a lot worse with
[04:16:28] Shia it's like there's another set
[04:16:29] that's just as good with Ayo the thing
[04:16:31] is even if eeko can technically be your
[04:16:34] best you can go glad you can go hard to
[04:16:36] depth you can go the other Hydro set nym
[04:16:38] or whatever I think that works on
[04:16:40] him yeah you kind of have to do some
[04:16:42] weird backing thing but you can make it
[04:16:44] work like there's other sets you can do
[04:16:45] you can go sub
[04:16:47] stats I'm not a big fan
[04:16:51] um I think it's a I think it's D tier
[04:16:54] for cope uh the only reason I'm not
[04:16:56] putting it f is because I like I don't
[04:17:00] think it's I don't think it's a tier
[04:17:02] below EO and
[04:17:07] eeko uh not eeko uh bubble I mean
[04:17:10] honestly maybe no I think the only
[04:17:13] reason it's not actually is because both
[04:17:14] of them give attack
[04:17:21] percent noers I mean it's terrible but I
[04:17:24] don't think it's
[04:17:30] like I don't think it's F I think it's
[04:17:33] D I mean maybe it's
[04:17:37] F no one should enter it that is true is
[04:17:41] it true
[04:17:43] what okay what if what if you
[04:17:47] play honestly it is true because even if
[04:17:50] you play Shia
[04:17:53] ayato if you play Shia
[04:17:56] ayato you're probably going M you like
[04:17:59] if you're being super efficient you
[04:18:01] strongbox Vermillion and then you use
[04:18:03] well two options either one you
[04:18:05] strongbox
[04:18:06] Vermillion and you use random [ __ ] on iO
[04:18:09] like glad because glad you get from
[04:18:12] bosses
[04:18:15] but if you use
[04:18:17] Ayo uh sorry but but or option two you
[04:18:20] do Mari and then whatever F I think it's
[04:18:23] D though I think it's D and the only
[04:18:25] reason it's not F You could argue the
[04:18:27] only reason it's not f is because the
[04:18:28] two pieces are very VI like versatile
[04:18:30] and if you're not like you're playing
[04:18:33] Shia without shenyun and you're not like
[04:18:34] you're not a finina puller there's an
[04:18:37] there's an argument to be made for okay
[04:18:38] I really want a strong box the set and
[04:18:40] not go farm for uh the other domain that
[04:18:42] we'll talk talk about I think it's cope
[04:18:44] I think most people shouldn't go
[04:18:46] there but I would feel bad putting it f
[04:18:49] given what the two pieces do I don't
[04:18:51] recommend it don't don't go in it but I
[04:18:53] don't think it I think it's bottom of D
[04:18:55] the difference between here and here is
[04:18:56] nothing though I don't I don't think
[04:18:57] it's a big deal I I think it's bottom D
[04:19:00] like no bias cuz they
[04:19:03] like there's an argument to strong box
[04:19:05] it in fact you could argue it's
[04:19:07] efficient for your child to strongbox
[04:19:11] it like your you're never going to not
[04:19:13] strongbox
[04:19:17] it um but you're not going to strongbox
[04:19:20] eeko like strong boxing Echoes feels
[04:19:24] dumb one character yeah but he's also
[04:19:28] good like that
[04:19:30] matters whereas this like okay Petra is
[04:19:33] literally one character but in one like
[04:19:36] two
[04:19:39] teams [ __ ] this AO slander okay it's not
[04:19:42] let me clarify it's not AO slander io's
[04:19:45] pretty DEC like he's pretty good the
[04:19:47] thing is IO has 50 sets like IO can
[04:19:49] literally just use glad which you get
[04:19:51] from bosses and glads like you're going
[04:19:53] to get glad by like playing the game
[04:19:55] doing weeklys doing this doing that so
[04:19:57] even though io's good I don't recommend
[04:20:00] going Echo for Ayo that's the main thing
[04:20:17] I'm gonna make a can I make a Vermilion
[04:20:19] tier can chat can I just make a
[04:20:21] Vermillion tier would you leave me alone
[04:20:22] if I make a Vermillion tier would you
[04:20:24] leave me alone if I make a Vermilion
[04:20:27] tier I'm
[04:20:38] um put it below f
[04:20:55] yeah I think it's just low D for the for
[04:20:57] the reasons I mentioned earlier I think
[04:20:58] it's low D You could argue High F I
[04:21:01] don't care I'm moving on cuz I don't
[04:21:02] want this to last an hour I'm leaving it
[04:21:04] low
[04:21:05] D I think it's the definition of
[04:21:09] d uh Spire oh this domain I love this
[04:21:12] domain
[04:21:15] deepwood and guilded
[04:21:18] dreams okay I'm going to say something
[04:21:21] and if you disagree with this then
[04:21:23] that's okay dendro is absolutely broken
[04:21:26] a lot of dendro reactions are good a lot
[04:21:28] of dendro characters or dendro teams are
[04:21:30] really good and you can do a lot of low
[04:21:31] investment clears with certain D
[04:21:33] reactions and dendro characters because
[04:21:34] of this s tier on top of that the the
[04:21:37] domain sorry the artifacts themselves
[04:21:39] can be very versatile what I mean by
[04:21:41] this is the following deepwood
[04:21:42] incredible for dendral supports or a
[04:21:44] support character dendro teams not only
[04:21:46] can dendro characters like Nita use it
[04:21:48] but also non- dendro supports can use it
[04:21:51] if for some reason your D character like
[04:21:52] if you want to run your D character on a
[04:21:54] lot of damage but you're running a
[04:21:55] kakomi that's just supporting uh just
[04:21:58] applying a bit of hydro you can give
[04:21:59] this to her you can give this to Jang
[04:22:01] Lee generally you're giving this to a
[04:22:03] dend user though a dendro character and
[04:22:05] it's good for a bit of dendro damage and
[04:22:07] then a huge resistance tread basically
[04:22:09] like the Verdes and VOR but for dendro
[04:22:12] um
[04:22:13] and then there's guilded dreams which is
[04:22:14] like super efficient this is just a
[04:22:16] bunch of em and some attack as well for
[04:22:19] free this gives you 80 em and then em or
[04:22:22] attack depending on your team usually
[04:22:23] it's just a bunch of em with like 14%
[04:22:25] attack metled in there um the two-piece
[04:22:29] is good two-piece of 0 em is good enough
[04:22:31] for something like hyper Bloom by the
[04:22:33] way and this is going to you're we're
[04:22:35] going to talk about this set next but
[04:22:36] not only is this set really good for
[04:22:39] dendro DPSS or even like DPSS in a d
[04:22:42] team it can also be good for non- dendro
[04:22:44] so it's good for like someone like Soo
[04:22:47] right in like dendro teams it's good for
[04:22:48] a dendro character in dendro teams like
[04:22:49] Alam but it's also good for like
[04:22:51] vaporize you can use this on Duo couta
[04:22:54] whatever you can it's just em it's not
[04:22:55] bad it's not necessarily the best in
[04:22:57] slot but it's efficient so it's good you
[04:22:59] can use the two-piece for transformative
[04:23:01] reactions let's say you're playing hyper
[04:23:02] bloom or buron you don't need to farm a
[04:23:04] brand new set for that you can just use
[04:23:06] gilded and you can even use two-piece if
[04:23:08] you can't get a good four piece which is
[04:23:09] really important because not only does
[04:23:12] that make hyper Loom accessible because
[04:23:14] you don't necessarily need like okay em
[04:23:16] Main St on five star set of this
[04:23:19] specific set you can just twopiece
[04:23:20] twopiece with wanders that's an em set
[04:23:22] that you get from killing bosses or you
[04:23:24] can four piece ideally more em and it's
[04:23:26] great or you can um I mean honestly you
[04:23:29] you might even be able to use one like
[04:23:32] fourstar em main stat we've talked about
[04:23:33] this before it's not even that big of a
[04:23:35] deal uh and you passively get that em
[04:23:38] set while you farm
[04:23:41] deepwood which is insane because
[04:23:43] deepwood you need or want in almost in
[04:23:46] most endro teams the exception is like
[04:23:48] aggravate you don't need it if you're
[04:23:50] not doing a lot of danger damage in
[04:23:51] those teams I put my ya Yao and
[04:23:53] instructor but deepwood is generally
[04:23:55] just go-to for Dango supports and the
[04:23:57] two-piece is viable as well if you don't
[04:23:59] have a good um Guild of dreams you can
[04:24:01] go like two-piece deepwood twopiece
[04:24:03] anything on someone like uh what's his
[04:24:05] name Alam boom you're chilling this
[04:24:07] domain's insane if you don't play dendro
[04:24:09] you don't need it but even if you don't
[04:24:13] okay first of all dendr is just
[04:24:14] broken um and a lot of the like you you
[04:24:18] could argue it's not necessarily broken
[04:24:19] but it's really good and some of the
[04:24:21] lowest way the some of the ways to clear
[04:24:23] Abyss with the lowest investment is with
[04:24:26] a team like hyper Blum or certain dendro
[04:24:27] teams that's not to say hyper is super
[04:24:30] broken and you need to use it but it's a
[04:24:33] lot of the times you're looking to clear
[04:24:35] Abyss with the lowest investment and
[04:24:37] this is one easy way to do it on top of
[04:24:40] that this guilded dream set could be
[04:24:41] used outside of dendro so because of
[04:24:42] that it's already an S tier and it's
[04:24:44] staying in s
[04:24:47] tier I think this domain is so efficient
[04:24:50] that it makes the the next domain less
[04:24:52] efficient in comparison or less
[04:24:54] efficient overall because this domain
[04:24:56] exists and that one is City of Gold so
[04:24:58] City of Gold is the Scara domain uh scar
[04:25:01] Mains how does it feel I'm in Vermilion
[04:25:04] you're here but the other set so this
[04:25:06] one gives you ano damage bonus on the
[04:25:07] two-piece and then um just normal attack
[04:25:09] charge attack PL attack damage um
[04:25:15] yeah no what am I
[04:25:18] saying yeah and normal attack speed
[04:25:20] that's what I was missing I was like
[04:25:21] there's something else to it when Char
[04:25:23] yeah okay so you get damage and then
[04:25:24] attack speed that's I I forgetting okay
[04:25:27] uh it's pretty Niche it's mostly just
[04:25:28] for Scara other characters can use it
[04:25:30] especially the two-piece like it's it's
[04:25:31] honestly fine on like Shia too you can
[04:25:33] like charge attack plunge it's fine on
[04:25:35] some characters
[04:25:37] um even non any like it's fine but it's
[04:25:40] mostly a scar set
[04:25:43] um the thing is though is that not only
[04:25:46] is there another set you could use with
[04:25:47] that character especially with finina
[04:25:49] which we'll get into but also the other
[04:25:51] set flower fire I lost is like weird
[04:25:53] it's technically the best set for Bloom
[04:25:55] hyper Bloom and buron generally because
[04:25:58] it gives you more damage to those
[04:25:59] reactions and em on the two-piece so
[04:26:01] it's pretty good the problem is unless
[04:26:04] you're like a scaran or you just want
[04:26:06] the set I almost never recommend farming
[04:26:09] flop be assuming you're farming the
[04:26:12] other domain that gives you deepwood and
[04:26:13] gilded now you might be like well why
[04:26:14] would I farm that set well if you're
[04:26:17] playing any team that wants flop you
[04:26:21] need deepwood like you need it it's a
[04:26:22] huge DPS increase to for your Bloom team
[04:26:25] for your burgeon team or for your hyper
[04:26:27] Bloom team because they're all dendro
[04:26:29] and so when I see people say oh you need
[04:26:31] so much resin to get a good hyper Bloom
[04:26:32] set because you have to farm a new
[04:26:33] domain no you don't you're farming
[04:26:35] deepwood already because you need it and
[04:26:37] you'll passively also get gilded right
[04:26:39] you're farming for both it's an
[04:26:41] efficient domain because you're farming
[04:26:42] both both and because you need this to
[04:26:44] even unlock these teams this is just an
[04:26:47] upgrade that I don't think is worth it
[04:26:49] for most people I don't even have a good
[04:26:50] flop set maybe eventually I will if
[04:26:53] you're like a Neu man or you really want
[04:26:55] to maximize your hyper Blom damage it
[04:26:56] can be worth it it can be efficient it
[04:26:59] can be but even in order to even unlock
[04:27:02] like hey I should farm this domain you
[04:27:04] need like or need farm this set in
[04:27:07] particular unless you're like the the
[04:27:08] scar Set wter uh you need deepwood
[04:27:11] already and as you farm deepwood you're
[04:27:13] already getting a good Bloom set a good
[04:27:14] burgeon set a good hyper Bloom set and
[04:27:16] that could also do more um so that's my
[04:27:20] take on it it's not bad like this set in
[04:27:22] a vacuum is pretty good it's just you're
[04:27:24] probably going to be farming this dendro
[04:27:26] Set uh anyways and so upgrading from
[04:27:28] gilded to flop is usually not worth your
[04:27:30] resin until everything else is done and
[04:27:33] then you're just kind of playing for
[04:27:34] upgrades like I clear every Abyss with
[04:27:35] Hyper Bloom among other teams and I've
[04:27:37] never used flop yet eventually I might
[04:27:40] get it but yeah it it's niche uh same
[04:27:42] with desert Pavilion Niche but both of
[04:27:44] them you can argue like if you play
[04:27:47] Scara then you there's a reason to do
[04:27:50] this if you're also you're like okay
[04:27:51] well I'll also get a hyper set passively
[04:27:54] and I can you know get my scar set
[04:27:56] whatever
[04:27:58] um this isn't in the box yet if it was I
[04:28:02] would say just strong box it
[04:28:07] um I think it's niche I think it's very
[04:28:09] niche
[04:28:13] I think there's more reason to step foot
[04:28:15] in this domain because there's no strong
[04:28:17] box of it yet than the other
[04:28:21] ones uh I will say though that with
[04:28:24] someone like
[04:28:25] Scara there have been new sets that are
[04:28:28] released that you can use instead of it
[04:28:30] uh even before that came out personally
[04:28:32] I used and I still do I use reminescence
[04:28:35] on him right which I put an S tier
[04:28:37] because I need emblem on 26 characters
[04:28:40] oh I got a good reminescence passively
[04:28:41] like no flex but my yoia is like top 100
[04:28:45] just I'm not trying to build her I'm
[04:28:46] just going for emblem and then boom I
[04:28:48] have a really good Yia ranking on a
[04:28:49] website that doesn't mean anything I'm
[04:28:51] sorry for bringing it up but it's like
[04:28:53] okay cool and this set's really good I
[04:28:55] can use it on scar I used it on rizzly
[04:28:56] as well before I got a good marish now I
[04:28:58] have that uh set but anyways oh
[04:29:01] passively
[04:29:02] boom um I still think it's B though cuz
[04:29:05] you know if you don't have the
[04:29:07] Alternatives or you really care about
[04:29:08] Scara like I care about sha the other
[04:29:10] set is good like flop is good it's just
[04:29:12] not a worthwhile upgrade you could argue
[04:29:15] B or C I'm going to put it here because
[04:29:17] it's not strong boxable and I could see
[04:29:19] you entering this domain with Logic the
[04:29:23] rapper
[04:29:25] what um okay molten iron Fortress
[04:29:29] another non-strong boxable
[04:29:31] domain nymph's dream and voru kasha's
[04:29:39] glow okay
[04:29:44] Vine
[04:29:45] boom okay I I don't even know how to
[04:29:50] feel before I say anything chat do we
[04:29:52] have Cals on child's artifact
[04:29:57] sets kqm child I want to know the
[04:30:00] numbers before I say anything because
[04:30:03] I've always been a child used substats
[04:30:05] and don't
[04:30:08] care new bis n stream is about 3% better
[04:30:12] than other options without pre- stacking
[04:30:14] 7even to 8% with pre-
[04:30:18] stacking okay so we're in the Vermilion
[04:30:20] levels of
[04:30:22] cope okay um that's according to kaching
[04:30:30] Maines personally I farm this domain
[04:30:34] very briefly just to get the 2% hp% the
[04:30:36] twopiece vasas for my nuu that's n's
[04:30:39] go-to usually twopiece vasha TWP mil you
[04:30:42] got HP you're chilling
[04:30:45] um the four piece is really weird it's
[04:30:48] very Niche there's like new characters
[04:30:50] that can like kind of maybe use it for
[04:30:52] the most part it's like made for DEA but
[04:30:54] even for DEA often times emblem is just
[04:30:57] better because you need a lot of ER in
[04:30:58] herb burst teams and it's a lot easier
[04:31:00] to build if you have a set that gives
[04:31:01] you ER and then damage from the ER
[04:31:05] and part of the reason why it can't be
[04:31:07] better is because sometimes glow could
[04:31:08] be like 1 or 2% better or whatever but
[04:31:10] emblems way more efficient to farm
[04:31:12] you're farming It Anyways add DE to the
[04:31:15] list of characters so for the most part
[04:31:17] I only like efficiency wise I enter this
[04:31:20] domain for the two-piece HP for someone
[04:31:22] like nuu maybe and that's it uh NYS
[04:31:26] though like the two-piece gives you
[04:31:27] hydro damage bonus the four piece can be
[04:31:28] used on some Hydro characters for
[04:31:30] example child technically his best in
[04:31:32] slot um yeah cool right cool uh you can
[04:31:38] use both two pieces on yolan or like
[04:31:40] finina but finina really wants gilded so
[04:31:42] not fre I take that back golden not
[04:31:43] gilded golden troop I I confuse the
[04:31:45] names I'm sorry don't be mad at me
[04:31:51] um twopiece [ __ ] on DEA even with C1
[04:31:55] it's not that bad doesn't C1 make de
[04:31:57] sanss uh HP becomes closer to attack and
[04:32:00] it's it's like pretty whatever so it's
[04:32:01] not bad but yeah like emblem is the
[04:32:03] go-to for de that's the thing and
[04:32:05] emblem's really efficient um I think
[04:32:09] even if you're a child man like I play
[04:32:11] well okay it's been a while since child
[04:32:12] but like I like child quite a
[04:32:14] bit so um if there was a set that was
[04:32:17] like insane for him I'd Farm it this set
[04:32:19] is technically his best thought but a
[04:32:21] lot of times with child it's like you
[04:32:23] really should just go substats because
[04:32:24] he can use a lot of sets efficiently he
[04:32:27] can use the other Hydro set a heart of
[04:32:28] depth he can use two be two be very well
[04:32:30] two be no bless especially with high
[04:32:31] investment frontload your damage he can
[04:32:33] use two pie of attack two pie of hydro
[04:32:36] um and also for the set to truly have
[04:32:39] potential that's kind of what we talked
[04:32:41] about uh
[04:32:42] Fox it really does get better if you're
[04:32:45] like Min maxing this effect and pre-
[04:32:47] stacking it right before you enter your
[04:32:49] e do like a normal or like whatever
[04:32:50] child Ms do you can like pre-stack it
[04:32:53] right
[04:32:54] cool you can do
[04:32:56] that uh you can pre-stack the set it
[04:32:58] becomes a bit better than Alternatives
[04:33:00] still kind of whatever I still recommend
[04:33:02] just going substats being efficient but
[04:33:05] you can use it if you farm it same with
[04:33:07] vasas I think there's a reason to enter
[04:33:10] the domain if you want but for the most
[04:33:13] part I don't recommend
[04:33:15] it not efficient sad face thumbs
[04:33:25] down okay chat spamming F I think this
[04:33:28] another D
[04:33:30] tier
[04:33:38] um D for DEA true
[04:33:43] why is nothing in a I think there's one
[04:33:45] too many tiers I really think there's
[04:33:47] one too many tiers we could move
[04:33:49] everything up like but I don't think
[04:33:50] this is a I mean lowkey it might be this
[04:33:54] we'll rearrange stuff at the
[04:33:56] end we'll rearrange stuff at the end
[04:34:18] yeah okay I think this is D
[04:34:20] because uh I don't think it's F just
[04:34:22] because this like the two-piece you want
[04:34:24] for nuu and then like they're not
[04:34:26] terrible the two pieces aren't terrible
[04:34:27] it's like I don't recommend it you
[04:34:29] shouldn't go here
[04:34:33] but you
[04:34:36] know how do I word what I'm trying to
[04:34:38] say
[04:34:52] I don't know what I'm trying to
[04:35:01] say yeah it's exactly like it's okay and
[04:35:05] because this set is technically best in
[04:35:06] slot it gives me the like okay certain
[04:35:09] people are really going to want it it's
[04:35:10] not that doesn't make it aici though but
[04:35:13] also because this gives you HP for like
[04:35:14] nuu it's okay like it's not good it's
[04:35:17] not efficient and that's what we're
[04:35:18] talking about but I don't I wouldn't put
[04:35:20] it f personally I think it's like here
[04:35:22] in the [ __ ] Vermilion tier of like
[04:35:24] basically F but not quite so
[04:35:29] D um
[04:35:31] yeah okay uh next
[04:35:35] domain Mar CH Hunter the new font 10 set
[04:35:38] and golden troop well
[04:35:41] this set has influenced every other set
[04:35:44] I've talked about every this domain has
[04:35:46] basically influenced every character
[04:35:48] build in the game because you can run
[04:35:50] this on most characters with finina and
[04:35:52] it's either as good slightly better or
[04:35:54] slightly worse than their signature set
[04:35:55] for a lot like 80% of characters it is
[04:35:58] insane it's like stupid that some
[04:36:01] characters can use it without finina
[04:36:02] like Shia if they're manipulating their
[04:36:03] HP and then basically anyone that's on
[04:36:06] field dpsing can use it with uh finina
[04:36:09] it is like the most insane thing ever
[04:36:11] it's not just that this is insane golden
[04:36:14] troops also insane for some reason it's
[04:36:16] another official buff it's like it it's
[04:36:19] so good this is like this is insane it's
[04:36:22] the thing is the like drawback is if you
[04:36:24] don't have finina there could be an
[04:36:26] argument for okay maybe this domain
[04:36:28] isn't as much for me even then even then
[04:36:32] golden troop is a sizable increase to
[04:36:34] someone like officials damage
[04:36:36] potentially yimo potentially Nikita if
[04:36:38] you're not running deepwood skill damage
[04:36:41] characters in General uh chlorin can use
[04:36:43] it Navia can use it um there's another
[04:36:46] set for Navia but yeah albo can use it
[04:36:50] if you don't want to farm husk which you
[04:36:51] shouldn't usually be
[04:36:54] farming oh I said chind I meant to say
[04:36:58] um I didn't mean to say
[04:37:00] choren I meant to say uh uh chori chori
[04:37:03] that's what I saying chori can use it
[04:37:05] that's what I meant to say um caught oh
[04:37:08] [ __ ] no but M I should say though is
[04:37:10] like yeah yeah you might not have finina
[04:37:12] but not only is finina broken and an
[04:37:14] archon so like it makes sense that the
[04:37:16] set is made like you know in
[04:37:19] her ideal but also even without finina a
[04:37:23] lot of font 10 characters that are
[04:37:25] really good can use it example nevet
[04:37:27] boom even without Fino you can use this
[04:37:29] and it's broken and then like rizzly can
[04:37:30] use it Lenny can use it Shia can use it
[04:37:32] good characters by the way well you know
[04:37:35] it to varying levels um so it's really
[04:37:38] good and then it becomes insane with
[04:37:40] finina and then golden troop is also
[04:37:42] just insane like in general um I would
[04:37:45] say let's say no one on your account
[04:37:47] needs mag you don't have uh finina and
[04:37:50] you're like okay I play fishal I have a
[04:37:51] good thunder so or twopiece twopiece
[04:37:53] should I upgrade to Golden maybe not
[04:37:56] necessarily but outside of that like
[04:37:58] even then it's a good upgrade like it is
[04:38:00] a good upgrade for FAL um but outside of
[04:38:03] that like in general it's good yeah y
[04:38:05] too like a lot of characters can use
[04:38:07] this um the thing with with Y it's like
[04:38:10] if you're on Fielding her you can use
[04:38:11] other sets as well but in general
[04:38:14] especially from off field it's a good
[04:38:15] set
[04:38:18] um and with yeah I mean if you are
[04:38:21] playing aggravate and fals like kind of
[04:38:22] carrying you then yeah you're right you
[04:38:24] it might be worth upgrading to Golden
[04:38:25] even in that situation but overall
[04:38:27] insanely efficient especially with
[04:38:29] finina or just font characters in
[04:38:31] general uh you know manipulating their
[04:38:33] HP and stuff broken set broken set also
[04:38:36] because of this set that's why
[04:38:37] vermillion's so low like yeah it's in
[04:38:39] strong box and yeah can technically
[04:38:41] still be best on Shia but mag CH is
[04:38:43] often times similar in strength and yeah
[04:38:46] you might overcap on crit raid with like
[04:38:47] Jade Spear and it can be annoying and
[04:38:49] like that's kind of why I don't want to
[04:38:51] put Vermillion in F maybe I'm coping as
[04:38:53] a Shain you can put it in your own F if
[04:38:55] you want but like M is so efficient to
[04:38:57] farm that you might just get it
[04:38:59] passively because you're going for it
[04:39:00] for like so many characters or so many
[04:39:02] teams with finina so I think it's really
[04:39:04] good I think this domain is like top of
[04:39:07] s uh very efficient lastly Waterfall oh
[04:39:11] no lastly this the arlino domain it's
[04:39:13] not out when I'm recording this but it's
[04:39:14] here I I cropped it terribly I'm sorry
[04:39:16] the reason these two are ugly is cuz I
[04:39:17] cropped them myself this is what it
[04:39:19] looked like I'm sorry I don't know what
[04:39:21] happened but um waterfall went song of
[04:39:24] days passed and nighttime Whispers in
[04:39:26] the echoing
[04:39:27] Woods this is
[04:39:29] very it's eh it's not strong boxable
[04:39:32] which means certain people might want it
[04:39:34] uh this is a Navia set right if you're
[04:39:36] playing Navia you're like oh I want this
[04:39:37] you can use on like ning Wong some Geo
[04:39:39] characters the two pieces attack uh song
[04:39:42] of days passed when it came out I
[04:39:43] dismissed it now I think with hindsight
[04:39:46] and thinking about it there are
[04:39:48] situations where it's nice notably if
[04:39:50] you're playing Bennett as a solo healer
[04:39:52] with finina and you need more healing um
[04:39:54] it can be a nice way of just getting
[04:39:56] more healing genuinely and still buffing
[04:39:57] your team it can be nice on Shen Yun if
[04:39:59] you're not running vescent vendor
[04:40:01] usually you're going vescent but some
[04:40:02] teams might not need it uh for example
[04:40:05] you could do like VV on farzon to buff
[04:40:08] your finina in a sh team and then shenu
[04:40:10] could use this but shenu could could
[04:40:11] also use ocean H clam or no blast it's
[04:40:13] not needed at all and neither is the Geo
[04:40:16] set but you can use the Geo
[04:40:18] Set uh with certain characters like
[04:40:21] Navia did I not say shenyun I was
[04:40:23] talking about shenyun I don't know if
[04:40:24] chat thought I wasn't saying shenyun but
[04:40:26] yeah usually you run VV on farzon and
[04:40:28] then this on shenyun or another set on
[04:40:29] shenyun or you could do like emblem
[04:40:31] farzon like and VV shenyun like you
[04:40:33] don't need it you really don't it's
[04:40:35] niche but you can use it um other
[04:40:38] healers can use it as well it's a
[04:40:40] generic healer set
[04:40:43] I think it's
[04:40:45] um it's pretty cope I think Navia is a
[04:40:48] good character and it's not strong
[04:40:51] boxable which is a plus like it's a a
[04:40:53] reason why you may want to go for it
[04:40:57] right um but overall it's pretty Niche
[04:41:01] and I don't recommend it that much I
[04:41:03] think it's in probably cop tier but it
[04:41:08] might it's in like C but you can't
[04:41:09] strong well maybe it's just in C
[04:41:12] actually B I don't think it's B Navia
[04:41:16] can still golden troop yes or oh my God
[04:41:19] it all circles back okay thank you
[04:41:21] chatter not only as I said Can Navia use
[04:41:23] Golden troop she can also use Mari CH
[04:41:25] with finina and it's sometimes even
[04:41:27] better or about as good as her signature
[04:41:30] set with finina like that's how good the
[04:41:32] set is it's insane and golden troop in
[04:41:35] general even without finina so yes uh
[04:41:38] because of that I'm going to put it high
[04:41:40] D You could argue if you're na man I'm
[04:41:42] sorry no disrespect uh and song of days
[04:41:44] past I think will get better as you may
[04:41:47] need healing maybe with finina maybe
[04:41:49] with new healers I think there's like
[04:41:50] you know maybe more testing to be done
[04:41:52] I'm not sure but I personally would only
[04:41:55] recommend it with like a bad healer with
[04:41:58] finina like
[04:41:59] Bennett
[04:42:01] anyways or like Shan Yun
[04:42:04] sometimes
[04:42:07] um would I put it C
[04:42:12] would I even okay let's say they're not
[04:42:14] in the strong box right now if they're
[04:42:15] in the strong box would I recommend
[04:42:17] strong boxing them well not really
[04:42:20] more not really like for most healers
[04:42:23] you're going no blast and you strongbox
[04:42:24] that for most DP like even like Navia
[04:42:26] yeah you you could strongbox if you're
[04:42:28] an Navi man go ahead but for the most
[04:42:29] part it would be like you still go
[04:42:30] golden troop or Mar say what you're
[04:42:32] farming which is like the same argument
[04:42:33] as like Shia where you just farm that
[04:42:35] set so yeah I'm putting it in D cop
[04:42:38] tier lastly the new domain
[04:42:41] these are announced they should they
[04:42:43] might they're probably out by the time
[04:42:44] this
[04:42:45] uploaded
[04:42:46] um song is as good as milth and no bless
[04:42:49] in the long term I disagree no bless and
[04:42:52] MTH are used on so many
[04:42:54] characters and nobless can be used with
[04:42:56] like no requirements you can have zero
[04:42:57] healing not care about anything you just
[04:42:59] press Q you buff your whole
[04:43:02] team it's out in like three days okay
[04:43:04] true
[04:43:11] um let me show you what these new
[04:43:12] domains
[04:43:15] do
[04:43:17] [Music]
[04:43:19] oh okay these are what the new domains
[04:43:21] do the new
[04:43:26] sets okay
[04:43:50] okay the thing with song Also to clarify
[04:43:52] is like I'm a Believer in the set I
[04:43:54] think there's situations where it's POG
[04:43:55] and like as I said I use it with
[04:43:59] finina on my Bennett with finina and I
[04:44:02] use it on my shenyun with Shia because I
[04:44:03] want to I want to buff my Shia and I I
[04:44:05] like you know I I I don't care about the
[04:44:07] rest but the thing is it's not worth
[04:44:10] going out of your way to farm it because
[04:44:13] almost all of your healers all of your
[04:44:14] like almost all of them can just slap on
[04:44:17] no Blaser instructor almost all of them
[04:44:19] and then the ones that deal damage from
[04:44:21] field can just run MTH like they can on
[04:44:22] top of the no blast user like on your
[04:44:24] kakomi on your chii on your Jang Le so
[04:44:26] like it's almost never worth going out
[04:44:29] of your way to get song unless you like
[04:44:32] I don't know really need it or just have
[04:44:34] the resin it's not worth it
[04:44:42] but I am a believer in song like I do
[04:44:45] think it's like decent I just don't
[04:44:48] think it's worth going out of your way
[04:44:49] to
[04:44:52] get as attack scaling becomes less
[04:44:55] common yeah but like you can go instruct
[04:44:58] like the odds of you I mean the odds of
[04:45:01] you not proing reactions and not needing
[04:45:02] attack are pretty slim and even
[04:45:06] then I mean like I guess if you're
[04:45:09] playing like
[04:45:12] I mean even with nevet like deaz on
[04:45:18] instructor I
[04:45:20] guess like I could see it I could see
[04:45:25] it I could see a future where like okay
[04:45:28] full HP scaling team you're not really
[04:45:31] proing reactions you might as well go
[04:45:33] song of days past for the damage
[04:45:35] increase I could see it um at that point
[04:45:38] I would recommend strong boxing it it's
[04:45:40] not there yet
[04:45:41] maybe it's I okay you've convinced
[04:45:44] me I don't know if this is correct
[04:45:47] though but I could see it I think right
[04:45:51] now though it's not worth it like right
[04:45:54] now I wouldn't enter
[04:46:00] it a few Niche situations don't change
[04:46:02] the general
[04:46:03] efficiency
[04:46:06] yes but like when we're in D tier like
[04:46:08] we're talking about those Niche
[04:46:10] situations and how how Universal that I
[04:46:12] mean that's honestly really rare too
[04:46:27] though night time and NY should be the
[04:46:29] same one isn't the difference between
[04:46:31] clam and song Tiny yes it is I think
[04:46:34] Shia
[04:46:36] Mains so I saw Cals I don't know from
[04:46:38] who that were saying song is better and
[04:46:40] I think determin that clam is better so
[04:46:43] I think it like I could be wrong so I
[04:46:46] think a lot of the times it's like very
[04:46:49] uh minimal okay okay I convinced myself
[04:46:51] and then I convinced myself the other
[04:46:52] way okay I think conclusion to save a
[04:46:55] bunch of time you could cut out the
[04:46:56] yapping okay okay okay song I think will
[04:46:59] get better as time comes especially if
[04:47:01] you don't need attack and like it
[04:47:02] because it gives you like it doesn't
[04:47:03] just buff your attack like no that's
[04:47:04] something will but even in those teams
[04:47:06] if you have enough healing ocean clam
[04:47:07] performs similarly sometimes slightly
[04:47:09] better sometimes slightly worse and so
[04:47:11] putting them next to each other both
[04:47:12] clam and song of day's past make sense
[04:47:14] in my mind however I cons I personally
[04:47:16] believe in song of day's past future I
[04:47:18] think it's a decent set but I'm still
[04:47:20] going to leave it in cop here because a
[04:47:21] lot of times other supportive sets are
[04:47:23] way more Universal or more efficient to
[04:47:25] farm or strong boxable or you already
[04:47:27] have them whatever so yeah it's probably
[04:47:29] not worth like going for that
[04:47:30] specifically but it it can be it has its
[04:47:33] uses but it's mostly
[04:47:36] cope
[04:47:38] okay but I also think clam is C
[04:47:42] it's very good on Chev yeah Chev can use
[04:47:44] it too but again
[04:47:47] like yeah Chev can use it adding that
[04:47:50] but like you know she can also use the
[04:47:53] other
[04:47:57] sets clam and husk should be C if clam
[04:48:02] and husk are if like okay if these if if
[04:48:04] if if CL if this is C this is like not
[04:48:07] far behind it if dude if this is C then
[04:48:10] these are all F and then there's no
[04:48:13] D and then the whole list falls
[04:48:23] apart isn't Chevy's healing kind of [ __ ]
[04:48:25] for days no no no I remember testing
[04:48:27] this for the guide Chevy can use it if
[04:48:29] you build it up healing because you'll
[04:48:30] you'll cap it in like a few ticks and
[04:48:33] you don't really have that many set
[04:48:34] options like you're as someone said
[04:48:36] you're probably on no blast with Bennett
[04:48:37] so like it's fine
[04:49:05] oh yeah another
[04:49:08] thing another thing so song of days past
[04:49:12] takes time to build up once you build it
[04:49:14] up though I think it's like continuous
[04:49:15] and like the up time depends but another
[04:49:17] thing is you can misuse the Buffs like
[04:49:19] you buff your active party member and
[04:49:21] like you can mess this up and it will
[04:49:22] buff the wrong character and like the
[04:49:24] wrong damage and like there is some
[04:49:26] inconsistencies with it as well um that
[04:49:30] might just be a skill issue but it's
[04:49:31] something worth mentioning for sure uh
[04:49:34] it is definitely a long ass set
[04:49:46] yeah but like I'm a Believer
[04:49:49] like
[04:49:55] yeah you can mess up thrilling Tales too
[04:49:58] it's not the same that's just um you
[04:50:00] know it's not the same cuz like this is
[04:50:01] overtime so you're going to be swapping
[04:50:03] through characters
[04:50:11] my voice cracked can you evaluate
[04:50:14] instructor instructor is pretty cracked
[04:50:16] but it's like um instructor is like a
[04:50:17] Min maxer set I mean I guess you could
[04:50:19] use it early game too cuz it's a
[04:50:20] fourstar but like you're not like I
[04:50:22] don't recommend leveling instructor like
[04:50:25] when you're still trying to like build
[04:50:27] your character I mean honestly yeah it's
[04:50:29] not even bad I think instructure is
[04:50:31] really good instructure like um I mean
[04:50:34] no it's not instructor okay that okay my
[04:50:36] point is instructor is not good in the
[04:50:38] mid game if you are like uh you're
[04:50:40] artifact stats are bad you don't want to
[04:50:42] be
[04:50:42] like H I mean yeah it is it doesn't even
[04:50:45] cost that much to [ __ ] level it's
[04:50:47] just
[04:50:48] like okay instr is always good but it's
[04:50:50] like if you're in the weird Middle
[04:50:51] Ground where let's say your Bennett's
[04:50:53] not healing enough and you don't have
[04:50:54] enough like you don't have enough ER on
[04:50:56] your
[04:50:57] Bennett you're not going to be like okay
[04:50:59] well I can go instructor and mid Max my
[04:51:00] ER you might not have that luxury but
[04:51:02] it's always a good set effect and then
[04:51:04] late game it's really good and like
[04:51:06] early game it's a fourar so it's cheap
[04:51:08] so instructor is generally just good
[04:51:11] It's just sometimes you might be in a
[04:51:13] weird middle Zone where it's a fourstar
[04:51:15] set you don't have good art like stats
[04:51:17] and you don't want to be like Min maxing
[04:51:18] another set and you might not get it
[04:51:20] from boss like you know but it's good
[04:51:23] generally it's
[04:51:32] good okay uh I'm getting stunlocked by
[04:51:34] this cuz now I'm second guessing but I
[04:51:36] think uh
[04:51:48] all right I'm pulling it no I'm not
[04:51:50] pulling it I don't trust you
[04:51:53] guys yeah I think it's
[04:52:03] D this is um how efficient it is to farm
[04:52:07] the domains that's what we're doing
[04:52:18] there's no alternative for Eos set mag
[04:52:20] should say with Fino but there's other
[04:52:22] Alternatives
[04:52:32] too I mean I guess they're just worse
[04:52:45] the alternative is to switch to
[04:52:50] Noel EO in this economy is
[04:52:57] crazy
[04:52:59] uh I mean I do see the logic though you
[04:53:03] could argue
[04:53:07] this because if you're playing certain
[04:53:10] character characters that don't have
[04:53:11] great Alternatives there's like you
[04:53:13] might want to strong box it and the same
[04:53:15] can be said about clam as a decent like
[04:53:18] healing alternative you usually wouldn't
[04:53:19] strongbox it but you like sometimes it's
[04:53:22] fine um I do think it's mostly cop
[04:53:30] though like CH what do you think [ __ ] it
[04:53:32] this okay I'm not going to respect the
[04:53:34] poll though I'm not moving it based on
[04:53:35] you guys I'm just
[04:53:36] curious husk clam r
[04:53:42] ranking um should I just put two tiers
[04:53:44] or all of them I'll just put C tier and
[04:53:46] D
[04:53:48] tier
[04:53:51] do what is a tier for dude don't talk to
[04:54:03] me sometimes you need two full sets and
[04:54:05] you can't strongbox two full sets okay
[04:54:07] here's the thing with veres ventor
[04:54:09] here's my take on VV
[04:54:10] okay I agree but
[04:54:15] also I would argue that there is no
[04:54:18] other domain with the biggest gap
[04:54:21] between best and worst like there's no
[04:54:24] other domain that's more strong boxable
[04:54:26] than vescent none there's no other
[04:54:28] domain where the other set is as garbage
[04:54:31] as maiden's none so even though VV is
[04:54:33] like SSS tier m is like f f f tier and
[04:54:37] so because of that there's no better
[04:54:39] strong boxable set at all like it's the
[04:54:41] strongbox set because yeah you might
[04:54:44] want to M Max your DPS more but like I
[04:54:45] would rather enter a domain with a
[04:54:47] really good set and one that I might use
[04:54:49] than maidens like there's a chance I use
[04:54:52] Thunder sother on my official if it's
[04:54:54] really good sure like probably not but
[04:54:56] sure but I'm not going maidens I'm just
[04:54:58] not so I don't think
[04:55:01] um like maybe like if you're playing
[04:55:04] Kazo sucr venti and then you want to run
[04:55:06] the twopiece on sh or something yeah you
[04:55:08] might Farm the domain but I I I don't
[04:55:11] nah I don't think m is that bad it is it
[04:55:16] is it's only good if you're like low AR
[04:55:19] and you need healing that's fine but
[04:55:22] even then you'd rather have song and
[04:55:24] you'd rather have clam and you'd
[04:55:26] probably just go no blast anyways
[04:55:51] [ __ ] Z is asleep or I'd randomly call
[04:55:53] him why are you asleep
[04:55:59] M maidens have better sub stats that's
[04:56:01] true
[04:56:04] actually oh my god I've been yapping for
[04:56:06] so long okay I got to wrap
[04:56:07] up oh my god I've been
[04:56:30] okay okay this might be copium
[04:56:52] we could delete a shift everything up so
[04:56:57] that this one dude okay okay okay I
[04:57:00] don't know how to explain
[04:57:02] this this domain I don't think should be
[04:57:05] next to Vermilion and nymphs but I don't
[04:57:08] think it should be next to like no blast
[04:57:10] either so I don't actually know where
[04:57:12] the [ __ ] it should
[04:57:25] go put Vermillion and F true
[04:57:36] actually H wait who actually uses husk
[04:57:40] albo but he has an alternative Noel but
[04:57:42] she has an
[04:57:44] alternative yunen two-piece and Goro
[04:57:50] twopiece chori can basically every Gio
[04:57:53] can EO is like the main one that needs
[04:57:56] it a lot of others have an alternative
[04:58:23] okay executive decision might be this
[04:58:26] and this but I don't feel like
[04:58:30] elaborating I will elaborate if you play
[04:58:33] Gio I think it's fine and also I don't
[04:58:36] think um clam is bad sometimes a lot of
[04:58:40] times it might be but sometimes it can
[04:58:41] be good Niche but husk can be good I
[04:58:45] don't think there's overlap between them
[04:58:47] but I can see an argument for it whereas
[04:58:50] uh emblem and shimad I think are I think
[04:58:52] emblem is [ __ ] amazing and I think
[04:58:54] you're farming it like 5 million
[04:58:56] times but but it's like okay so the
[04:58:59] thing with these like both sets are
[04:59:00] broken gamebreaking insane AR like
[04:59:03] lowkey whereas this one one is like
[04:59:06] insanely broken and then shanaa is good
[04:59:13] but it's not amazing it's like
[04:59:18] okay
[04:59:21] okay and emblem is strong boxable it's
[04:59:24] just you're usually not You Won't Get
[04:59:26] Enough from just draw boxing
[04:59:29] it
[04:59:31] but I think I just think a tier is
[04:59:33] lonely and I'm biased by that
[04:59:49] okay I'm keeping it s I changed my mind
[04:59:50] okay last sets arlino set I'm just
[04:59:53] moving on last arino set uh is this one
[04:59:55] fragment of harmonic Whimsy it's good
[04:59:57] for arino it gives her the most damage
[04:59:59] possible it's 18 time three damage which
[05:00:02] is like 56 I think math um so you know
[05:00:06] good damage no not 56 18 plus 18 is
[05:00:10] 34 cuz 36 and then plus another 18 6
[05:00:13] Plus yeah four so 54 okay I said 56 it
[05:00:16] was 54 right yeah 54 and then 80% attack
[05:00:21] so this de gives you 54% uh damage
[05:00:23] increase just for your bond of life and
[05:00:26] then 18% attack Bond of Life arlino
[05:00:29] mechanic it's also a font 10 mechanic
[05:00:30] with some weapons we can test this when
[05:00:32] it's out I'm pretty sure it's not going
[05:00:34] to work very well if you're not arino or
[05:00:36] maybe a future character
[05:00:42] yeah and then attack percent like the
[05:00:44] stats you get on this thing are insane
[05:00:45] but like you're probably not farming
[05:00:46] this for anyone other than arino as I'm
[05:00:48] recording this arino is not out she's
[05:00:50] probably going to be pretty good cool
[05:00:52] set to farm for her I wouldn't right now
[05:00:54] I wouldn't recommend it for other
[05:00:55] characters it'll probably be good for
[05:00:57] more in the future um but for now it's
[05:01:00] just arino the other set is burning for
[05:01:02] some reason I don't know why they
[05:01:03] decided to make a burning set but I mean
[05:01:05] I guess burning sucks and it needs a
[05:01:07] buff sure um what this set does is it
[05:01:11] gives you damage when there's someone
[05:01:13] that's burning and it even Buffs you
[05:01:14] when you're off field if there's no
[05:01:16] burning you lose the damage bonus and
[05:01:17] you get 18% attack 80% attack substats
[05:01:19] are are good versatile the burning
[05:01:22] effect is cool it's good for burning
[05:01:24] teams for whoever is either burning or
[05:01:26] just a like a damage dealing off field
[05:01:29] whatever in that team cool even then if
[05:01:32] you're running like finina or you're
[05:01:33] taking burning or burgeon damage anyways
[05:01:36] which you might be you can usually just
[05:01:37] run Mar Hunter even like either with
[05:01:41] finina or even without finina if you're
[05:01:42] taking damage from your own reaction
[05:01:44] which burgeon often times will do or
[05:01:46] like sometimes burning if you're close
[05:01:47] to en me but usually it's more for buron
[05:01:50] but mostly for
[05:01:52] finina
[05:01:55] um so it will give you damage bonus
[05:01:57] which can make it nice but usually there
[05:01:59] is a better set from my understanding of
[05:02:01] the set it's damage bonus which won't
[05:02:03] affect the transformative reaction that
[05:02:04] is burning so it won't actually buff
[05:02:06] your burning damage it'll buff your
[05:02:08] characters in a bir uh burning team
[05:02:10] it's fine it's just really Niche and
[05:02:13] right now I don't think these teams are
[05:02:14] like ideal there might be like you know
[05:02:16] like a burnmouth g maybe like burn Vape
[05:02:19] there's some burn Vape teams that you
[05:02:20] can play it's fine there's still other
[05:02:23] sets that can even be better or used
[05:02:25] instead that you might uh that will be
[05:02:27] more efficient to
[05:02:28] farm but it's it's it's yeah like
[05:02:31] there's a situation but as it stands
[05:02:34] right now burning is not is like one of
[05:02:35] the worst reactions that might change
[05:02:38] but for now that's that so so not a big
[05:02:40] fan uh I am a fan of what am I doing I
[05:02:42] am a fan of the arlino set for arlino
[05:02:45] but again as it stands it's very Niche
[05:02:47] that might change with new characters so
[05:02:50] right now but yeah you want it for arino
[05:02:52] like it's a lot of
[05:02:54] damage so for
[05:02:57] now
[05:03:02] um it's arguably a b because it's new
[05:03:06] not strong boxable and arino is insane
[05:03:08] oh okay we don't know and arino is going
[05:03:11] to be pulled by like literally everyone
[05:03:12] because of how prominent she will
[05:03:16] be so I'm probably like I
[05:03:20] think just like looking at the sets
[05:03:23] objectively I don't think it should be
[05:03:25] that high because right now there's only
[05:03:26] like one character that could use it
[05:03:28] which it would rank it around C however
[05:03:30] I think it'll get better in the future
[05:03:31] and I think arlino will be very popular
[05:03:33] so it might be B
[05:03:36] um especially given
[05:03:41] uh I should probably wait to see the
[05:03:43] difference in strength between this and
[05:03:46] other sets for our
[05:03:48] Lino because again it the thing with
[05:03:51] like someone said it's similar to Navia
[05:03:52] set I was thinking about that but the
[05:03:53] thing with Navia set is like navet can
[05:03:56] be similar to Alternatives and also
[05:03:58] worse than Magi sometimes or like as
[05:04:00] good whereas I don't think that will be
[05:04:02] the case for AR Lino
[05:04:04] set but we don't know yet because the
[05:04:07] Cals aren't
[05:04:08] out um
[05:04:11] um it's BRC I think because the burning
[05:04:15] set is extra Niche and probably not
[05:04:17] great like I would rather have um what's
[05:04:19] this that called flop on my account than
[05:04:21] burning I'm going to put it
[05:04:24] C but I think it could get a lot better
[05:04:27] I do think
[05:04:30] so let me think not look at chat close
[05:04:33] my eyes do I think this is C or B right
[05:04:35] now uh arlino set good for her not good
[05:04:38] for anyone else it might be good for
[05:04:39] other people in the future burning set
[05:04:41] you're basically never using it twopiece
[05:04:43] gives you attack which is nice you're
[05:04:44] probably not playing burning if you are
[05:04:46] viable if you're not even if you are
[05:04:48] there's other sets though so that set is
[05:04:50] like let's pretend it doesn't exist our
[05:04:52] Lino set it's decent it's good for one
[05:04:55] like Niche C okay cuz it's either b or d
[05:05:00] depending on how many characters will be
[05:05:01] able to use it for now we put it C it
[05:05:03] might drop to D it might drop uh uh go
[05:05:05] up to B
[05:05:06] see are you recording yeah thanks for
[05:05:08] the B though I appreciate you I'll read
[05:05:09] your message in a
[05:05:12] minute C for chlorin well we don't know
[05:05:15] what she does but imagine chlorin uses
[05:05:16] it too and then [ __ ] the next
[05:05:17] character use the two then boom a tier
[05:05:20] but probably
[05:05:26] not damn a having nothing in it is like
[05:05:29] crazy but I think the gap between S and
[05:05:33] B is like
[05:05:34] huge I think it's actually really big I
[05:05:37] think the gap between blizzard stare and
[05:05:38] emblem is like in insane if St box
[05:05:41] didn't exist this would like go up
[05:05:43] obviously and like there would be more
[05:05:44] balance like you could put like this in
[05:05:46] a or some [ __ ] but because of strongbox
[05:05:51] like Mar say a tier okay you
[05:05:54] are that is the worst take I've seen all
[05:05:57] day and I've seen a lot of bad takes
[05:06:13] AR Lino domain is quite good come
[05:06:16] on wait why wait I'm actually curious
[05:06:18] why people think that is this arino bias
[05:06:21] I love arino I love her but like I also
[05:06:23] love Shia and vermillion's dog [ __ ] but
[05:06:25] like this is really good on arino but
[05:06:26] like name me another character that's
[05:06:28] released right now that can use it and
[05:06:30] name me a character that's released
[05:06:31] right now that can use a burning set
[05:06:33] like there's a few Niche teams burnmouth
[05:06:35] ganu cool but like maybe in the future
[05:06:38] again I can't predict who's coming out
[05:06:40] in like the next patch and stuff I don't
[05:06:42] know I genuinely don't know this might
[05:06:44] go up it might I it might when I was
[05:06:57] here and it might go down like it might
[05:07:00] actually go down if it's only arino it
[05:07:02] might go down I'm not even kidding like
[05:07:03] there's a chance it's D if it's only
[05:07:05] arlino and no one else then it's D
[05:07:11] logic Navia said might go up no it's a
[05:07:12] weird Niche Geo set and like even Navia
[05:07:15] herself can use Mar CH for like the same
[05:07:18] power level or golden troop for
[05:07:22] decent they not the same
[05:07:47] okay dude it's actually
[05:07:54] uh I mean I think I'm done but like no a
[05:07:57] is actually a little wild I do think
[05:07:59] this domain is more efficient than this
[05:08:01] domain if we're being honest like if I'm
[05:08:03] being like okay I can do whatever the
[05:08:05] [ __ ] I want but this is going to look
[05:08:06] stupid I would literally do this like
[05:08:09] not even kidding I'm not even joking if
[05:08:11] this is like I can make as many TI as I
[05:08:13] want I'm doing this it's like this then
[05:08:15] that then this and this and this but
[05:08:17] like that looks
[05:08:21] weird
[05:08:25] okay make a tier you should probably
[05:08:28] specially farm for one of them okay
[05:08:30] that's like weird that's a lot of words
[05:08:41] do you put only used on four units no
[05:08:43] it's not it's used on more also the
[05:08:45] two-piece is versatile also gilded is uh
[05:08:48] really good and the two-piece is really
[05:08:49] good and you need deepwood it's not like
[05:08:51] deepwood is just viable it's you need it
[05:08:53] like you're not playing D without it if
[05:08:54] you're playing Neu Bloom without
[05:08:56] deepwood you are like way doing way less
[05:09:01] DPS it's not just a like oh you can use
[05:09:03] an alternative you can't like you need
[05:09:05] it it's like like VV like you need it
[05:09:07] and you can't strongbox it if this was
[05:09:10] strong boxable it you know you could
[05:09:23] argue this is assuming strong
[05:09:30] box gild's barely better than twopiece
[05:09:32] twopiece yeah but see I got you okay
[05:09:35] twopiece twopiece what you're saying
[05:09:36] twopiece em with two piece em okay name
[05:09:38] the twopiece EM sets
[05:09:40] there's wanders okay and then there's
[05:09:41] gilded and flop which you're not [ __ ]
[05:09:44] farming over
[05:09:45] this so it's like the two-piece is
[05:09:48] gilded like twopiece gilded is good you
[05:09:50] don't need four piece but it's like it's
[05:09:52] the set you're using like I'd rather go
[05:09:53] twopiece gilded than Farm
[05:09:59] flop so
[05:10:02] yeah my
[05:10:08] thoughts oh oh my God you're a genius
[05:10:11] hns Kurt I'll give you a kiss on the
[05:10:14] lips if I
[05:10:15] could I'm sorry I said that wait you're
[05:10:18] actually a
[05:10:19] genius I think a tier is Gladiators and
[05:10:22] Wanderers it's not even a domain a
[05:10:25] domain but it's like they they come
[05:10:26] together I'm
[05:10:30] sorry oh but I guess you're not you're
[05:10:33] not strong boxing them though are you
[05:10:34] like I wouldn't I mean it's not even
[05:10:36] that bad to do glad but I wouldn't no
[05:10:39] you're just getting it from
[05:10:42] bosses You're Not Strong boxing them
[05:10:48] though I'll change what the a tier's
[05:10:50] called okay [ __ ] it I looked up
[05:10:51] gladiator wander and a Truck came up
[05:11:13] what if I put passively Farm don't
[05:11:16] strong
[05:11:18] box
[05:11:21] a a for
[05:11:40] okay now I just need a picture Chad do
[05:11:42] we have a PNG of glad and
[05:11:48] wander how do I get
[05:11:56] it the truck
[05:12:33] oh would you look at that glad wander
[05:12:35] magically appeared
[05:12:42] no but you don't want to be strong
[05:12:43] boxing it I don't want people to think
[05:12:44] you have to stbx it how do I remove it
[05:12:46] why can't I get it out bro go out get
[05:12:48] out get
[05:12:58] out efficient but
[05:13:02] don't strong box
[05:13:16] I'd say it's sufficient to like um try
[05:13:19] to get your last piece of it like if
[05:13:21] you're at like three out of
[05:13:24] four just use words okay you're right
[05:13:28] delete
[05:13:31] row honestly dude what if I just remove
[05:13:34] the
[05:13:36] letters this looks so much better if I
[05:13:38] just remove the letters
[05:13:46] or I
[05:13:47] just add a row below and I write tier
[05:13:51] Gap tier
[05:13:54] Gap cuz like there's actually a gap
[05:14:03] here is only good if you have finina no
[05:14:05] it isn't Net's like the best DPS in the
[05:14:07] game and he can use it without finina
[05:14:08] you can use on rley you can use on uh
[05:14:10] sha you can use on Linny and you can use
[05:14:11] on future characters as well and
[05:14:12] probably some existing ones that I'm not
[05:14:13] thinking of like burgeon teams if or
[05:14:16] burning if you're taking your own self
[05:14:17] damage Additionally you can run marishi
[05:14:19] with finina who's like a broken support
[05:14:21] you probably should be
[05:14:23] getting ging that's someone I forgot
[05:14:26] there you
[05:14:27] go so like there's
[05:14:30] like that so Niche that's a niche that's
[05:14:34] good outside of its main usage which
[05:14:36] isn't Niche outside of the other said
[05:14:39] that's broken so it's like it's it's too
[05:14:41] good it's actually unfathomably good
[05:14:43] there's like five different good parts
[05:14:44] about
[05:14:55] it okay this is my list I'm too
[05:14:58] indecisive though so this is a second
[05:14:59] Channel video not a main but I think
[05:15:00] it's a good
[05:15:07] video If strong don't exist everything
[05:15:10] here moves up everything in the strong
[05:15:11] box tier except like this and this move
[05:15:28] up okay I'm going to end this here
[05:15:31] however I want to see what it looks like
[05:15:33] if I remove the letters does it look
[05:15:34] worse or
[05:15:37] better um
[05:15:55] dude this actually looks better this
[05:15:57] actually looks so much better without
[05:15:58] the
[05:16:04] letters and then I add a row above
[05:16:06] called maybe cope Maybe not and then
[05:16:10] it's this this and
[05:16:15] husk wait I'm actually a genius cuz
[05:16:18] these depend a lot more like if you're a
[05:16:21] geog God or like oh my God it's actually
[05:16:23] this I found it this is the solution
[05:16:25] boom this is the final one you can't
[05:16:27] even argue this you could argue but I
[05:16:29] don't want to argue that okay GG I win I
[05:16:31] win I actually just won remove the
[05:16:33] letters
[05:16:39] okay we're
[05:17:07] done
[05:17:37] e
[05:18:07] e
[05:18:37] e

[05:23:48] I tried to end but this guy gifted 100
[05:23:50] so I'm going live for the delute guide I
[05:23:53] appreciate you okay can I end again
[05:23:56] that's all dude my stream [ __ ] it I
[05:23:58] clicked end recording I didn't click end
[05:23:59] stream it
[05:24:01] crashed how is that on me I just clicked
[05:24:04] end
[05:24:05] recording that's all I did
[05:24:08] my throat hurts I'm tired dragon mass
[05:24:10] 600 gifted you're a Chad I appreciate it
[05:24:12] thank you so much uh I will say the the
[05:24:15] other reason I'm starting is because
[05:24:16] seeing this here makes me embarrassed
[05:24:18] and I actually want to lower it so don't
[05:24:20] get mad at me also I was thinking the
[05:24:22] following thing what if strongbox isn't
[05:24:25] included and I just want to farm domains
[05:24:26] and never strongbox here is what changes
[05:24:29] I figured it out I actually had time to
[05:24:31] think and I thought look at what happens
[05:24:33] this goes all the way there because
[05:24:35] vescent vener is literally needed as
[05:24:37] long as you're running an an emo
[05:24:38] character and you probably are because
[05:24:39] they're broken milth goes right here uh
[05:24:43] actually no it doesn't milth is really
[05:24:44] good but it's not need on every support
[05:24:46] but it's really good uh Crimson witch
[05:24:48] yeah we're putting it here as well I'm
[05:24:49] also uh uh uh I'm going to change this
[05:24:52] to generally good this goes here changed
[05:24:56] to
[05:24:57] Niche this no bless you're farming that
[05:25:00] for every account and this goes here
[05:25:02] okay that's all
[05:25:04] ratio dude I crashed randomly
[05:25:11] how is that my
[05:25:18] fault dude it was not my fault wasted no
[05:25:23] it wasn't wasted we still have the bot
[05:25:24] it's fine it's fine I don't think I
[05:25:25] saved the recording though but it's
[05:25:29] fine yeah if strongbox doesn't exist
[05:25:32] though it changes to like this I think I
[05:25:34] think these are are like potentially
[05:25:37] really good
[05:25:38] good potentially
[05:25:43] good and
[05:25:46] this honestly it's probably that oh
[05:25:52] Gage actually no it's
[05:25:55] not same shirt dude I'm not I'm not
[05:25:58] streaming again it literally just
[05:26:04] crashed no strong box list
[05:26:10] there's no strong
[05:26:16] box uh yeah that's it dude how is that
[05:26:20] my fault no Laura will be next stream
[05:26:22] [ __ ]
[05:26:23] it why is bloodstain an S blood stain
[05:26:25] sucks but no bless you need on like
[05:26:27] every account so strongbox isn't a
[05:26:28] factor then this is probably here I
[05:26:31] think that's fair to say thoughts
[05:26:34] thoughts
[05:26:39] then it's not efficient okay well then
[05:26:41] it's here whatever don't talk to me no
[05:26:43] this is still here though VV is like too
[05:26:45] good I don't
[05:26:47] care anyways it doesn't matter this
[05:26:49] isn't making anything this one doesn't
[05:26:56] matter same
