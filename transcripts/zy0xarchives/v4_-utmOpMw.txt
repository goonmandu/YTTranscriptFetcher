[00:12:28] clear Abyss I'll explain that to you
[00:12:29] guys that I is better than but we're
[00:12:31] also gonna do

[00:12:47] okay so if you guys like oh I want my
[00:12:48] account to be reviewed here's here's
[00:12:50] what's gonna happen
[00:12:52] when fontan's out I'm gonna do a whale
[00:12:54] review
[00:12:55] where we're fixing a well that can't
[00:12:56] clear the abyss because maybe the
[00:12:57] Fontana Abyss will be hard or something
[00:12:59] we'll see who knows that's gonna be one
[00:13:00] also I'm gonna do a cursed account
[00:13:02] review which might be this week or next
[00:13:04] so if your account is cursed and you're
[00:13:06] like what the [ __ ] is happening what do
[00:13:08] I do we're gonna be fixing that and

[00:13:13] doing a hundred uid reviews
[00:13:15] 100 people's accounts
[00:13:18] on a smaller scale it's gonna be like a
[00:13:20] in-depth account of you'll be 100 like
[00:13:21] just do ideas
[00:13:22] I'll do probably 50 today or 50 tomorrow
[00:13:25] because I don't trust that I can do 100
[00:13:26] today but the point is the video is
[00:13:29] going to be I reviewed 100 counts so
[00:13:30] we're gonna do 50 today 50 tomorrow or
[00:13:32] 100 today I don't know
[00:13:33] and that's gonna happen
[00:13:41] stops happening uh also
[00:13:45] I want to do my 100
[00:13:47] 000 resin on Vermillion video the only
[00:13:50] problem with that is there's like
[00:13:51] nothing to like what can I do
[00:13:56] wow guys look I got a em Sans
[00:14:09] do you guys want to know a secret
[00:14:12] do you guys actually want to know secret

[00:14:15] thousand resin on Vermilion recap video
[00:14:17] it's gonna be like a shower showcase
[00:14:18] it's gonna be hype it's gonna be cool oh
[00:14:19] my God I cried while watching it
[00:14:22] but I was also gonna make a video
[00:14:25] on the three streams ago or three okay
[00:14:29] I've done this three times but
[00:14:31] the three times ago I spent 2 000
[00:14:33] residents Vermillion I said my goal is
[00:14:35] to get a good Echoes piece if I don't
[00:14:37] care if I can't remember I'm happy but
[00:14:39] if I get Echoes I can make that into us
[00:14:41] I accidentally got an amazing ayato but
[00:14:44] then I got nothing good on either set so
[00:14:46] then a few streams ago I did another
[00:14:48] 2000 resident stream I said the same
[00:14:50] thing I didn't get anything
[00:14:52] yesterday last stream I spent another
[00:14:55] 2000 on Ito and Xiao obviously Xiao
[00:14:57] primarily didn't get nothing so I can't
[00:15:00] even make an eye to a like funny video I
[00:15:02] can't do [ __ ]
[00:15:04] so we have to keep going not naturally
[00:15:06] naturally we have to keep going
[00:15:08] naturally we have to keep going it is
[00:15:10] what it is you know you can't end on a
[00:15:12] loss it is what it is you can't end on a
[00:15:15] loss xayax is crazy crazy you dropped

[00:16:20] block and then quit give up early
[00:16:26] do you guys think do you guys think if
[00:16:28] if Logan Paul gave up early he wouldn't
[00:16:30] have crypto scammed his viewers after
[00:16:32] walking into a Forest in Japan he would
[00:16:34] have left it there but he didn't give up
[00:16:36] and then he scammed people that could be
[00:16:38] me nah I didn't say that I did not say

[00:17:44] the way
[00:17:44] a quote from my stream which is uh uh
[00:17:47] the only way to get a good five star on
[00:17:48] this Banner is if you lose the 50 50
[00:17:50] which is absolutely true by the way
[00:17:52] absolutely true by the way uh I love
[00:17:55] kokomi but even kokomi doesn't like her
[00:17:57] donut I like wander he can use his Bell
[00:17:59] literally no one else can so uh yeah
[00:18:06] it's a 75-25 I know I literally knew
[00:18:08] that but I was like it won't sound as
[00:18:10] good oh my God I got Bible I forgot okay
[00:18:13] okay okay not to throw Fang under the

[00:24:47] no I actually don't think it's this
[00:24:50] oh it could be like something sh but
[00:24:52] then where's the Ogo oh start
[00:24:55] o e no it's not that s e wait let me
[00:25:00] beat the lights quickly
[00:25:01] I'll read all the films after wait
[00:25:03] s-e-t-h-o
[00:25:07] wait I feel like this is a word
[00:25:11] I feel like there's a word that looks
[00:25:13] like this like um
[00:25:17] I feel like there's a word that looks
[00:25:18] like this
[00:25:21] is a word no it's not there's a word
[00:25:23] that looks like this though there's a
[00:25:25] word like like a meth like
[00:25:27] meth it's not meth it's
[00:25:30] what if it's t e
[00:25:34] oath
[00:25:36] o t h
[00:25:40] other
[00:25:41] no there's no R [ __ ] uh
[00:25:45] I Wanna Cry
[00:25:49] oh [ __ ]
[00:25:52] other okay what if it's what if it's q
[00:25:55] no s a no h can be second h e
[00:26:00] t o
[00:26:07] pass stop no there's
[00:26:12] oh
[00:26:21] the only word like this is like Rodeo
[00:26:23] but there's no r
[00:26:24] it can't be and the O can't be there so
[00:26:26] it's like something Dio like Sid video
[00:26:30] oh my God I oh
[00:26:34] oh there's no h I'm [ __ ] stupid yo yo
[00:26:37] okay chat I don't want to look at chat
[00:26:38] because you guys probably have a strong
[00:26:39] answer I'm sorry if you're clipping this
[00:26:41] don't include me being stupid skip past
[00:26:43] it I'm sorry I forgot there was an H it
[00:26:45] could have been like hideo okay I
[00:26:49] it happens when you're so smart you
[00:26:51] forget the basic things it's just a
[00:26:53] thing that happens it's called
[00:26:54] Einstein's equilibrium this is actually
[00:26:56] a good guess though because now I know
[00:26:57] the O isn't there and it isn't there
[00:26:58] which proves through mathematical
[00:27:00] equations that e is either here or here
[00:27:03] and O is either here or first letter so
[00:27:05] now I know that it starts it's it's e
[00:27:08] something o something watch it's like
[00:27:12] Clorox
[00:27:14] g g o no can't be
[00:27:23] oh like it's like detox but there's no D
[00:27:25] is there a word like that like
[00:27:35] okay what if it starts with oh it could
[00:27:37] be like oh
[00:27:39] something oh you know it can't be e
[00:27:42] something o s o
[00:27:46] okay what the [ __ ] is this word
[00:27:54] is this wait there's a word like this if
[00:28:01] is this a streamer oh my [ __ ] it's a
[00:28:04] valorous streamer that's not a word
[00:28:14] I'm looking up ethos
[00:28:19] the characteristic Spirit of culture era
[00:28:22] or community
[00:28:24] wow
[00:28:26] ethos
[00:28:37] we learned that in middle school I went
[00:28:39] to middle school in French
[00:28:42] Rosa lawyer but doesn't know ethos
[00:28:44] pathos logos that's not a [ __ ] law
[00:28:45] term you bonobo also it's now deemed
[00:28:49] cringe to use a bunch of Latin phrases
[00:28:51] in the court because unless it's like a
[00:28:53] specific one that you learned and that
[00:28:54] you need to use because there's no other
[00:28:55] term it seems condescending and you look
[00:28:57] like an [ __ ] if you say like [ __ ]
[00:28:59] post-hoc Ergo prompter Hulk when no one
[00:29:02] else knows what the [ __ ] that means [ __ ]

[00:33:55] work on it together two heads are better
[00:33:57] than one
[00:33:58] this has to be like
[00:34:00] I actually don't know who would say this
[00:34:02] it's like a friend I don't think Jean
[00:34:03] would say this she's too busy to care
[00:34:05] about us but I kind of want to guess her
[00:34:06] something on your mind
[00:34:11] two heads are better than one
[00:34:17] two heads better than one
[00:34:23] who has two heads
[00:34:30] wait okay I just said this was a waifu
[00:34:32] but now I wanna now I think it's a
[00:34:34] character that is like
[00:34:35] a kid so it's gonna seem weird if I
[00:34:37] guess them so I'm gonna guess Jean and
[00:34:39] then I'm gonna Guess the Character I was
[00:34:40] thinking so it's not weird okay I think
[00:34:42] this could be the heat up okay it was

[00:34:47] that was weird I thought it would
[00:34:49] let's just move on listen
[00:34:52] listen
[00:34:55] I I realized like I feel like I heard
[00:34:59] this one listen
[00:35:00] I realized I thought because think about
[00:35:04] it let's not think about it I know
[00:35:06] because I was like in my mind who wants
[00:35:07] to work together it'll be like gene or
[00:35:09] like Lisa but then I was like oh [ __ ]
[00:35:11] knowledge nahida I
[00:35:16] I promise this looks worse
[00:35:19] intellect
[00:35:23] what is this
[00:35:26] wait let me close chat what the [ __ ] is
[00:35:28] this
[00:35:30] looks like an Animo icon though it could
[00:35:33] be who tells e oh my God I'm so good I
[00:35:35] am dude oh my this is why hutau chose me
[00:35:38] and not you chat this is why hutao chose
[00:35:41] me
[00:35:42] real
[00:35:48] wait is this why I keep rolling flat HP
[00:35:49] because Utah likes me
[00:35:53] it's okay I like hotel too
[00:35:56] I'm a hotel lover
[00:36:05] what about Xiao okay here's the harsh
[00:36:08] reality of being a Charmaine if you are
[00:36:10] a true chow mein and Xiao loves you like
[00:36:12] he loves me which isn't possible but
[00:36:14] anything close to that you will suffer
[00:36:16] as he did xiao's existence is suffering
[00:36:18] his trailer suffering his backstory
[00:36:21] suffering the yakshas dead his whole
[00:36:23] thing is suffering so if you're a true
[00:36:25] chow mein you suffer your luck bad your
[00:36:28] artifacts bad your social life bad
[00:36:30] everything bad you suffer for Xiao and
[00:36:33] it'll all work out in the end okay Xiao
[00:36:35] finally smiled when there was a lantern
[00:36:37] right we will all smile in the end it'll
[00:36:40] get better but for now it's suffering
[00:36:41] and that's okay okay but that's how true
[00:36:43] Xiao means that's what Xiao does to you
[00:36:46] so don't main Chao if you have a choice
[00:36:48] the problem is we shall means we didn't
[00:36:51] choose the main Chao
[00:36:53] Xiao chose us
[00:36:58] anyways we got the hotel
[00:37:00] and we got Nikita
[00:37:03] endless mode
[00:37:04] ayato
[00:37:05] Bennett
[00:37:07] Sino oh monster hydros uh Masa Hydro
[00:37:10] Barbara Mona wait last time was Mona
[00:37:12] this time since Barbara five head
[00:37:16] oh I knew it wasn't that
[00:37:23] anyways
[00:37:27] I haven't heard anything more true in my
[00:37:29] whole life okay it is real though that
[00:37:31] your main chooses you like
[00:37:34] if you have a friend and you're like you
[00:37:36] know what type of character they like or
[00:37:38] what type of person they are you can
[00:37:40] guess who they're gonna Main in genjin
[00:37:42] it's not like they have a free choice no
[00:37:43] the [ __ ] they don't unless they like
[00:37:46] pull a character and they're like oh my
[00:37:47] first five star like sure but like if
[00:37:49] they act other than gotcha they actually
[00:37:51] are chosen
[00:38:03] all right anyways
[00:38:11] um
[00:38:14] the only problem is I tend the main
[00:38:16] characters
[00:38:17] that I don't I like I usually disavow
[00:38:20] the mains of the characters I play in
[00:38:22] most games not and get you know shout's

[00:40:51] also
[00:40:55] to explain what happened
[00:40:57] or why we're on the Asia account
[00:40:58] actually I don't need to explain yet
[00:40:59] I'll I'll show it as we go
[00:41:01] uh let me turn Co-op off though so I
[00:41:04] don't get spam requested
[00:41:07] who's this Shadows
[00:41:13] I don't even run an ad you can't I can't
[00:41:15] it's too late in the Stream
[00:41:16] like even if I click it it doesn't go
[00:41:22] okay
[00:41:25] listen
[00:41:28] so
[00:41:32] yo mods have to work overtime today I'm
[00:41:34] sorry
[00:41:34] okay listen
[00:41:37] so I was thinking right I was thinking
[00:41:40] it would be good content if I took an
[00:41:42] account that was in the in the dumps
[00:41:45] an account that was in the trenches
[00:41:47] an account that was pages of 30 months
[00:41:50] holy [ __ ] Thirty thirty months no life
[00:41:53] no [ __ ] no sleep yeah we're gonna
[00:41:55] mute that one uh-huh yeah [ __ ] you
[00:41:57] there's a 30 though
[00:41:58] I was thinking hey it would be cool if
[00:42:02] I took an account that was in the
[00:42:04] trenches in the dumps and I brought it
[00:42:06] to Greatness okay and I count that right
[00:42:08] now and maybe be at like floor nine four
[00:42:10] ten of the abyss and could get the floor
[00:42:12] twelve clear it Nine Stars
[00:42:15] in a short amount of time we don't spend
[00:42:17] we don't do anything like that and we
[00:42:19] clear everything
[00:42:21] so
[00:42:23] I was thinking of making this into like
[00:42:25] a video right where it's like I'll like
[00:42:27] I'll Transform it I will go through the
[00:42:28] transformation you guys will watch us
[00:42:30] like the progression will level talents
[00:42:32] well artifacts will make the account
[00:42:34] good fast and then you guys were like
[00:42:36] whoa this is how you should progress and
[00:42:37] then you can progress and then in the
[00:42:39] end we'll clear the abyss it'll be hype
[00:42:42] people will be crying
[00:42:44] and clapping
[00:42:49] and we have 220 pink so it's relatable
[00:42:52] so let's look at what this account is
[00:42:56] and what it has to offer
[00:43:01] now before we get into that you might be
[00:43:03] wondering hey zox why is Xiao and
[00:43:05] Bennett why are they dead what account
[00:43:07] are you on
[00:43:08] first things first
[00:43:10] what account are you on and why is Xiao
[00:43:12] and Bennett dead well off stream I tried
[00:43:15] to fight child and I lost well I won I
[00:43:17] claimed the rewards but it was close and
[00:43:19] I lost two characters okay this is the
[00:43:21] account we're starting with okay so when
[00:43:23] I say cursed account I mean cursed
[00:43:25] account this it's so cursed that it has
[00:43:27] a festering desire but only refinement
[00:43:29] rank too because I was too lazy to get
[00:43:30] all of it so this is our Asia account
[00:43:34] I call it free to play although
[00:43:36] technically two years ago I got a
[00:43:38] welcome but only logged in five times so
[00:43:40] we'll just save some spare Primo gems so
[00:43:42] it's as if we were free to play because
[00:43:43] we won't spend the extra ones
[00:43:47] uh but we haven't really touched it and
[00:43:49] so what I want to do is take an account
[00:43:52] that looks like this right let's just
[00:43:54] look at a ratio I mean not bad
[00:43:56] right
[00:43:58] I used to play Razer or this is not bad
[00:44:00] wait no I did what the [ __ ]
[00:44:03] wait
[00:44:12] anyways an account that's
[00:44:15] probably at four like okay the highest
[00:44:17] we've been was we cleared floor nine so
[00:44:18] we're at around the floor nine to ten at
[00:44:20] the abyss and we're gonna take it to 412
[00:44:22] and fully clear it
[00:44:24] that's the plan we're not starting a new
[00:44:25] account we're taking a cursed one and
[00:44:28] then we're gonna see how we could
[00:44:29] progress as fast as possible afap if you
[00:44:32] will
[00:44:34] to fully clear everything
[00:44:37] and you can see the progression and the
[00:44:39] struggle now you might be like sucks
[00:44:41] what is with this account okay we have a
[00:44:43] black Liverpool xiaomane two of our
[00:44:46] lesson two Berserker right now so we
[00:44:47] have actually a good ratio our shout
[00:44:49] outs unironically listen listen shut up
[00:44:51] it's actually good it's actually not bad
[00:44:54] okay we're at the phase where we need to
[00:44:57] focus on like our talents I don't even
[00:44:59] have slimes because listen it's it's
[00:45:01] scuffed it's stuffed okay my voice
[00:45:04] didn't crack it scuffed but we're
[00:45:06] getting there okay and we're gonna go to
[00:45:09] the motion to make this account great
[00:45:12] we have here's what we have on this
[00:45:14] account
[00:45:15] we have Xiao we have official
[00:45:18] we have Bennett we have cintro we have
[00:45:22] baydo we have Shang Ling
[00:45:25] and for the five stars Xiao Albedo from
[00:45:29] his first manner Eula from her first
[00:45:30] Banner mono
[00:45:32] kaching
[00:45:35] actually pretty good
[00:45:37] now I was thinking either we place no fi
[00:45:41] I was thinking we play only Xiao is our
[00:45:43] five star but I don't know yet
[00:45:47] I mean I guess we could use kaching
[00:45:49] she's really good but I kind of want to
[00:45:51] play like I kind of like use like four
[00:45:52] star characters I think it's like cooler
[00:45:55] but kaching is also pretty relatable
[00:45:57] because she's a standard five star maybe
[00:45:58] we do play kitchen I don't know
[00:46:02] we're either gonna do kaching aggravate
[00:46:04] or shangling
[00:46:06] tell me why Shang
[00:46:11] oh also we have a zero farzan and I
[00:46:15] thought it would be [ __ ] hilarious if
[00:46:17] you guys got to experience the
[00:46:18] free-to-playing farazon experience if
[00:46:20] you guys got to witness it see what a
[00:46:22] c05 is like because I've been used to C6
[00:46:25] and trust me it's comfy
[00:46:29] also we don't have much leveled like we
[00:46:33] like I if I filter by energy recharge
[00:46:36] right this is gonna be my highest energy
[00:46:38] recharge piece oh wait that's actually
[00:46:40] good okay wait but yeah okay that like
[00:46:43] like bro I have a plus eight cents
[00:46:45] that's the highest
[00:46:46] what is it why did I farm Vermillion
[00:46:49] anyways this account has potential okay
[00:46:52] and I want to turn an account that dude
[00:46:54] look like your account might look like
[00:46:55] this right now a lot of four star five
[00:46:57] stars like you started artifact farming
[00:46:59] but not really you went to Vermillion
[00:47:01] because you're dumb like me what's
[00:47:02] happening you don't know your talents
[00:47:04] aren't even fully leveled your weapons
[00:47:06] aren't even fully leveled you don't even
[00:47:07] know where you're going and I'm going to
[00:47:10] transform this into a thing of beauty
[00:47:13] and so here's the game plan first we're
[00:47:16] going to establish what teams we're
[00:47:19] gonna play Then Focus only on those
[00:47:20] eight characters then we're gonna level
[00:47:22] all of our weapons level our talents as
[00:47:25] fast as possible using our fragile resin
[00:47:27] that we get from leveling the account
[00:47:29] and from our daily 160 resin or 240 I
[00:47:32] think but we're not going to refresh
[00:47:34] and
[00:47:37] then we're gonna start artifact farming
[00:47:39] as we kind of have a strong Boxford
[00:47:41] Essence boom Oh my God
[00:47:44] and we're gonna make this account clear
[00:47:46] Abyss floor 12 Nine Star or six star or
[00:47:50] just clear it we'll see but we're gonna
[00:47:52] make it clear for 12 as possible
[00:47:54] from an account that right now can only
[00:47:55] clear like four nine or ten that is the
[00:47:58] plan
[00:48:00] also in case you're wondering
[00:48:04] we are now AR 40 we are currently r46 it
[00:48:07] is a pretty low count but it's a very
[00:48:08] old account
[00:48:12] um
[00:48:25] also okay guys I'm just being honest
[00:48:27] right now
[00:48:32] I don't know if I want to play kaching
[00:48:34] or shangly but if I play shangling I'm
[00:48:37] gonna have to fish for the catch and I
[00:48:38] would rather go outside
[00:48:40] fully naked
[00:48:42] scream then I would get arrested because
[00:48:44] why the [ __ ] am I naked arrested deal on
[00:48:47] the news twitch streamer gone too far
[00:48:49] I'm behind bars I have to pay a fine be
[00:48:51] like guys I was I'm sorry I don't know
[00:48:53] what got into me and then be escorted
[00:48:55] back to my home after paying that fine
[00:48:57] instead of fishing for the catch I would
[00:48:59] rather do that I'm sorry I'm sorry I
[00:49:01] don't want to do either I'm just saying
[00:49:02] I would rather do that than fish for the
[00:49:03] catch so if I read magically get a catch
[00:49:06] on my account
[00:49:07] just let's both say it's me okay let's
[00:49:10] both say zox farmed it off stream he
[00:49:12] went fishing it was cool
[00:49:20] I might do a fishing stream I might do a
[00:49:22] fishing stream I'm kidding I might
[00:49:23] actually do a fishing stream I don't
[00:49:25] want to though
[00:49:32] crispy outside tender inside oil meets
[00:49:35] fire deep fry slow bake globa mad
[00:49:38] condensed pyronado
[00:49:47] oh yeah and by the way in case you're
[00:49:48] wondering are shy links d0 like I'm
[00:49:50] telling you this account has a lot of
[00:49:52] five stars but we don't have like that
[00:49:53] many characters we we did get lucky on
[00:49:55] Beto I remember for some reason we have
[00:49:57] C3 beta which is [ __ ] huge and I want
[00:50:00] to use Beto but other than that I think
[00:50:01] our officials like c0 are sucrose to C1
[00:50:05] which is Big
[00:50:06] um that's Razer down to C3
[00:50:12] C1 I guess

[00:57:29] right now on Vermillion
[00:57:35] no it says 52.
[00:57:38] that's not even dude top 52
[00:57:42] and our Vermillion is garbage
[00:57:45] like compared to our other set because
[00:57:47] our offset's literally verdescent but
[00:57:48] like
[00:57:50] we used to be top one but it's fine okay
[00:57:52] it's still fine it's it's still dude
[00:57:56] there's a 2v series at number five I
[00:57:58] wonder if our TV series is better
[00:57:59] actually I don't know
[00:58:00] yeah
[00:58:02] maybe not better than this guy but I
[00:58:04] don't know if it's better than a
[00:58:04] Vermillion
[00:58:07] I don't know I could check
[00:58:09] anyways
[00:58:11] anyways
[00:58:15] Psy Oaks without same one sense I can't
[00:58:19] okay look at what's funny though so if
[00:58:21] we look at my shadows and my artifacts
[00:58:22] right highest value one is my shadow
[00:58:24] Sans then it's the shall flower then my
[00:58:27] shell goblet isn't here but it also has
[00:58:29] attack so it's not bad and then I also
[00:58:31] have
[00:58:33] um
[00:58:39] those memories
[00:58:40] so dark
[00:58:43] anyways
[00:58:46] okay let's go back on our main account
[00:58:48] but just keep in mind that this account
[00:58:49] actually let me uncut resin more because
[00:58:51] I'm gonna be streaming for long okay
[00:58:52] let's do a smart boy dude what's a smart
[00:58:53] place to spend your resin we should
[00:58:55] probably pick our teams first okay let's
[00:58:56] pick teams
[00:58:59] wait this part will probably be in the
[00:59:02] this part will probably be important
[00:59:03] let's pick teams
[00:59:09] so there you go four nine that's as far
[00:59:11] as we got
[00:59:18] foreign
[00:59:31] I'm chatting really fast
[00:59:44] sorry I got distracted okay
[00:59:48] yeah so we got the phone on check the
[00:59:49] history someone said uh challenge
[00:59:51] summary
[00:59:54] I mean
[01:00:09] okay let's pick a team let's pick a team
[01:00:10] so this is what we're gonna we're gonna
[01:00:12] work towards so I think we should play
[01:00:14] shot with a c0 farzan because it's
[01:00:16] comical and shot was really good I
[01:00:18] believe that was good
[01:00:19] still gross and Bennett
[01:00:21] the only problem is in this team
[01:00:24] if we play this team our next team can't
[01:00:27] run changling because we want better
[01:00:29] with shangling like yeah you could play
[01:00:30] her without her him but it's not that
[01:00:31] great it's not as good so I wouldn't do
[01:00:34] it so we I want to do this
[01:00:36] I think second team we play hyper blue I
[01:00:39] think hyperloom is really good or we
[01:00:40] could play uh electrocharged or we could
[01:00:43] play Quicken
[01:00:45] like this
[01:00:46] now I like Kuching
[01:00:49] I really like a chat I think she's fun
[01:00:51] I don't think she's good
[01:00:53] but I also think we could play a
[01:00:56] four-star team which is more you know
[01:00:58] wow four stars and Beto's really broken
[01:01:00] we could do beta official
[01:01:03] um either Central sucrose but like
[01:01:04] [ __ ] Hazel or we say [ __ ] that and we
[01:01:07] play dendro because dendro's good and
[01:01:09] then we do dendro MC
[01:01:11] come on yeah yeah I don't
[01:01:15] see and then uh we don't have a Healer
[01:01:17] dude I need yayao or Kirara I mean we
[01:01:19] can see
[01:01:21] no because that official's hyperbooming
[01:01:22] I don't have kooky
[01:01:25] okay so I don't have Electro healer oh
[01:01:27] Barbara
[01:01:31] wait where's Barbara
[01:01:34] wait Barbara
[01:01:36] bedroom MC
[01:01:47] Barbara I'm gonna make a place like Joe
[01:01:51] yeah my initial plan was kaching dendro
[01:01:54] MC
[01:01:55] official and then Barbara which is
[01:01:57] actually not bad that's an emo dude it's
[01:02:00] the same okay [ __ ] you guys it's the
[01:02:02] same thing it's literally look look look
[01:02:03] okay I didn't want to have to teleport
[01:02:06] but I will
[01:02:20] pull for kokomi
[01:02:25] okay here's my philosophy I could vote
[01:02:27] for kokomi but I kind of want to save my
[01:02:28] Primos because I want to wait for Fontan
[01:02:30] like I think fontan's gonna be hyped so
[01:02:31] I want to wait I love kokomi but I
[01:02:33] already have on my main so I kind of
[01:02:35] want to wait
[01:02:41] what's up
[01:02:47] foreign
[01:02:59] okay
[01:03:03] no the point of having a second account
[01:03:05] isn't to play the same characters as I
[01:03:07] main the only reason I pulled for Xiao
[01:03:09] here was because I figured that oh I
[01:03:11] wouldn't be playing child with my man
[01:03:12] anymore because there'd be too many
[01:03:13] characters so I want another account to
[01:03:15] only play xiaowan
[01:03:16] I still play kokomi every day
[01:03:36] [ __ ] you guys
[01:03:37] that does it yeah
[01:03:55] all right so uh sorry I was thinking so
[01:03:58] okay ciao photos in sucrose Benito right
[01:04:04] second half this is where we can play
[01:04:06] multiple teams I would like to play if
[01:04:08] it's up to me I play kaching official
[01:04:10] dendro MC Barbara because it's fun
[01:04:12] Barbara's underrated so it looks cool
[01:04:15] you're like what the [ __ ] you're playing
[01:04:16] Barbara I like this team
[01:04:18] but we could also make other good teams
[01:04:20] like I think even without dentro this
[01:04:22] team
[01:04:23] and then uh like hazel or some [ __ ] is
[01:04:26] actually really good too
[01:04:28] or
[01:04:32] or we could do like
[01:04:34] do like this and then like kooky when we
[01:04:36] get kooky if we get kooky or Dory but
[01:04:38] preferably kooky doesn't even work
[01:04:41] do you meow no not a try though thing
[01:04:44] you could meow
[01:04:50] um
[01:04:57] what do you guys think Chad actually
[01:04:58] I'll probably let you guys decide
[01:05:01] no wait EULA hyperbloom
[01:05:08] yeah so a lot of people who haven't
[01:05:11] played travel c05 might think sucks
[01:05:15] you said Xiao was good with one of Nemo
[01:05:17] support right Xiao sucrose Bennett and
[01:05:19] then let's say Fishel is a good team and
[01:05:21] that's true
[01:05:22] so can't you just do that with farazan
[01:05:25] My Sweet Summer child
[01:05:28] you don't know
[01:05:30] so if SARS on C6 yeah but far Zone c0
[01:05:34] needs like in this team would be like
[01:05:37] 396 ER I'm not even kidding like 300 so
[01:05:40] more than 300. so I mean no probably not
[01:05:44] more but around 300 and our child c0 and
[01:05:46] our fire is on c0 so we really really
[01:05:48] want another Nemo and then you can't
[01:05:50] really use Hazel here so it would have
[01:05:51] to be this we could use Animo MC
[01:05:56] okay listen hold the copium right hold
[01:05:59] the copium what if we do Bennett an EVO
[01:06:02] MC
[01:06:04] Stu girls here
[01:06:06] hey hey
[01:06:11] then Colleen now we can also play Fishel
[01:06:13] [ __ ] it [ __ ] dentro we just play taser
[01:06:28] hey who let me cook
[01:06:33] foreign
[01:06:51] on her own as long as they have it well
[01:06:52] not on her own but with an electro she
[01:06:54] can hyperbloom
[01:06:57] um
[01:06:59] so like a good deadro character would be
[01:07:01] good here
[01:07:04] damn there's actually so much we could
[01:07:05] do holy [ __ ]
[01:07:08] okay shot I guess you guys can choose so
[01:07:10] we're playing Xiao right we're playing
[01:07:11] Xiao
[01:07:14] do you guys want the other team to be
[01:07:15] this is the option for the other team
[01:07:17] okay
[01:07:18] we either do
[01:07:21] kaching
[01:07:23] aggravate
[01:07:24] like this
[01:07:26] with Barbara or we do
[01:07:29] Beto
[01:07:34] sing show
[01:07:36] official
[01:07:39] or no beta Synchro sucrose
[01:07:42] and then we Flex either facial if we
[01:07:45] want a taser or a dentro character if we
[01:07:48] want a dendro
[01:07:52] what do you guys think
[01:07:53] we can pull it I'll pull it and I'll
[01:07:55] play the character you guys want
[01:08:00] because it'll also influence my first
[01:08:01] team so let me just set up the poll
[01:08:04] which team
[01:08:06] Xiao first f
[01:08:10] responses catching no wait kaching
[01:08:14] aggravate
[01:08:15] Beto
[01:08:17] sing Cho
[01:08:21] taser or hyperbloom [ __ ] I can't write
[01:08:23] all that
[01:08:25] I'll just do
[01:08:27] sing Cho I think you guys can choose is
[01:08:29] there another option I mean we could do
[01:08:30] shangling but I don't want to push
[01:08:31] anything uh
[01:08:42] Simon wants to know we're not talking
[01:08:44] about this specific Abyss we're talking
[01:08:46] about just like teams we should build
[01:08:48] for our account
[01:08:50] oh my God it's literally 50 50. this is
[01:08:52] Forever by the way this isn't just this
[01:08:54] Abyss this isn't just the best do you
[01:08:56] guys want me to play kaching or Beto
[01:08:59] that's what I'm asking
[01:09:07] oh my God
[01:09:09] damn Beto's winning
[01:09:16] hey I [ __ ] love Beto
[01:09:24] yeah also okay we can okay so first of
[01:09:28] all
[01:09:29] let me take a picture of this pole so I
[01:09:30] save it this moment will be Frozen in
[01:09:32] Time who says that chat
[01:09:34] if you know who says that type the
[01:09:36] corresponding emote
[01:09:40] that was the infinite balls and chat
[01:09:42] glitch
[01:09:43] wait fanger sent me a link what is this
[01:09:47] does the site show my
[01:09:55] wait this is [ __ ] adorable
[01:09:58] she sent me an Ali Express leak look at
[01:10:00] this
[01:10:02] look call me slime or call me uh jelly
[01:10:05] what are those called [ __ ] fungus
[01:10:06] thing
[01:10:08] that's cute
[01:10:11] buy it I actually want it
[01:10:23] link I could link it but I don't know if
[01:10:25] it's like legit
[01:10:32] anyways okay let me finish this so I
[01:10:34] don't get distracted because this might
[01:10:35] be in a video okay so here's how I
[01:10:37] choose what DPS character I want to play
[01:10:39] right it's like first it's like okay who
[01:10:41] do I like and enjoy playing Xiao also
[01:10:43] he's good because he's hypercarity so I
[01:10:44] can invest into him and he has good AOE
[01:10:46] so he's generally fine in any content
[01:10:48] the only thing is you might have to flex
[01:10:49] his team like sometimes in this Abyss
[01:10:51] you need Hydro so we can put [ __ ]
[01:10:52] like kokomi or Syncro or Elon or
[01:10:55] something next up right
[01:10:56] true okay okay true people saying bias
[01:10:59] okay [ __ ] you it's true it's just true
[01:11:01] it's literally true good AOE good and
[01:11:04] most content true
[01:11:06] other than that
[01:11:08] for the other team there's a few options
[01:11:09] okay here again you could go based on
[01:11:11] what you like because we could play
[01:11:12] kaching we could play Eula we could play
[01:11:13] beta we could play shangling right but
[01:11:16] first of all chat already chose Betos
[01:11:18] intro second of all if we build a team
[01:11:20] that's like Beto sincho official right
[01:11:24] these three characters are good in like
[01:11:26] everything like they're literally okay
[01:11:28] sex artificial are literally always good
[01:11:30] at supports and like almost every team
[01:11:31] assuming you want the elements and then
[01:11:33] Beto's really good when you can use her
[01:11:35] so it's like it's really good for like
[01:11:37] your whole account and then we're also
[01:11:38] they suggests here
[01:11:39] the only thing I don't like is that we
[01:11:42] have to play a Nemo MC here but I think
[01:11:44] that's based because anyone MC is funny
[01:11:45] now alternatively we could do
[01:11:54] uh a dendro team here
[01:11:56] like this and double
[01:11:59] alternatively
[01:12:01] we could play Hazel instead of sucrose
[01:12:02] here which is worse but that would let
[01:12:04] us use sucrose here so I don't actually
[01:12:06] know what I want to do I think we do an
[01:12:08] email MC
[01:12:09] uh first half what do you guys think
[01:12:12] chat
[01:12:13] like I actually don't know what's better
[01:12:16] I think the thing I like about
[01:12:19] um uh animal MC is that she can shred
[01:12:22] resistances
[01:12:24] not not resistances but animores
[01:12:28] but sugars gets throwing tails
[01:12:31] all right let's see actually
[01:12:34] hey so Giga Chad
[01:12:37] foreign
[01:12:53] anyways if I get a name on cc6 right
[01:12:58] um
[01:12:59] Animo res is decreased by 20 percent
[01:13:02] which is actually good because farzans
[01:13:04] well farzan also has res decrease but
[01:13:07] still anemo res shred is hard to get
[01:13:10] generally speaking uh farlone has it
[01:13:12] right here 30
[01:13:15] um
[01:13:15] yeah but we don't have this we don't
[01:13:18] have this and we don't have this
[01:13:27] do you have five sword for Nemo MC
[01:13:40] okay maybe sucrose is better
[01:13:44] um
[01:13:46] I mean
[01:13:48] wait let's look at our other weapons I
[01:13:50] think I have
[01:13:51] okay I do have stock prags if I want
[01:13:53] energy which could be good
[01:13:55] um
[01:13:56] wait what do I have for hazel I have an
[01:13:58] R1 with this
[01:14:00] or mapa but probably what's this yeah
[01:14:04] what about first
[01:14:06] Rob harp
[01:14:08] I have harp and stringless and fav
[01:14:11] [ __ ]
[01:14:16] five Hazel shut the [ __ ] up this isn't
[01:14:20] as a Jeff stream if we play Hazel we're
[01:14:22] gonna make him do damage
[01:14:24] all right
[01:14:33] ah
[01:14:38] what's the other weapon type I didn't
[01:14:40] check oh Claymore but I mean I don't
[01:14:41] guess we don't care about claymore's but
[01:14:43] oh no Beto Beto
[01:14:49] ah Beto can use like one of these it's
[01:14:51] fine
[01:14:52] serpent spine is so much better but
[01:15:05] Hazel isn't doing damage without farzan
[01:15:07] just put him on five you papega [ __ ] you
[01:15:10] I think rain Sasha's gonna aggravate
[01:15:12] it's okay actually I mean it gets better
[01:15:14] it gets better
[01:15:16] with the refinements but it's it's okay
[01:15:18] so em
[01:15:19] okay because we just did we just did
[01:15:21] Beto weapon house here's how em works on
[01:15:23] beta right yeah aggravates usually as
[01:15:25] good as attack but not with Beto because
[01:15:27] Beto's scalings are she doesn't Electro
[01:15:29] a lot she just Electro's big like is
[01:15:31] that like she doesn't Electro as often
[01:15:33] as like yai or like fish or whatever but
[01:15:35] her scalings are [ __ ] huge so like
[01:15:36] Em's less good but the effect of this
[01:15:39] weapon is not bad
[01:15:41] especially they're five minutes
[01:15:43] where's the weapon right here actually
[01:15:45] do I have it
[01:15:54] whoa whoa
[01:15:59] where is it did this beta guide is so
[01:16:01] old and still not updated like uploaded
[01:16:02] it's been like 20 days so the weapon
[01:16:04] rankings like 20 days ago
[01:16:06] I'm scrolling
[01:16:20] race R1
[01:16:23] yeah researcher R1 and pro type archaic
[01:16:25] are basically as good literally about as
[01:16:27] good
[01:16:31] what about this is non-aggravate
[01:16:33] research is a lot worse yeah
[01:16:37] Saj
[01:16:46] hilarious hang down quickly sorry
[01:16:50] that's my Bido thing
[01:16:54] I don't know what the song is whether
[01:16:55] this is my playlist
[01:17:06] yeah we already have our cake flexed uh
[01:17:09] if not I [ __ ] read your chat I didn't
[01:17:10] say yeah we're never kick leveled oh I
[01:17:12] could use sock if I want to on field her
[01:17:14] but I don't think we're gonna on field
[01:17:15] her I guess the ER is nice dude what if
[01:17:17] we just is there a five on the weapon
[01:17:19] but no it's [ __ ] bow
[01:17:25] yeah
[01:17:27] and now we save
[01:17:40] foreign
[01:17:56] oh it's all coming out now
[01:18:03] we might actually play Hazel
[01:18:24] now we're playing Hazel and shall though
[01:18:29] that is so fun okay well
[01:18:42] a Nemo man I mean I am in a Nemo man
[01:18:45] that is true
[01:18:47] level 90 every new character on my main
[01:18:48] right I haven't done that yet you guys
[01:18:50] think I should do that
[01:18:55] foreign
[01:19:13] like this if we're not playing dendro
[01:19:17] and then if we are playing deadro
[01:19:22] we'll probably do something like
[01:19:27] I want to put sucrose here for playing
[01:19:29] dead Dragon because Hazel's not gonna be
[01:19:30] on full em I mean I guess you'll play
[01:19:31] Hazel full am no because he doesn't even
[01:19:33] swirl this
[01:19:34] I mean he I guess he does and his chart
[01:19:37] attack but star Jack's tiny
[01:19:49] I don't think we're playing deadro if we
[01:19:51] have to play dendro we'd put like Dedra
[01:19:53] MC here we would do like
[01:19:55] this
[01:19:58] and then sucrose would go here
[01:20:00] if we have to play danger we change it
[01:20:02] to this and then this would be
[01:20:03] dangerously not anymore
[01:20:07] but also I'm on 220 pings so I don't
[01:20:09] know if I can play A Healer this team
[01:20:11] sorry
[01:20:13] how would I Parry on Tundra ping
[01:20:28] I can also official
[01:20:32] I mean I could also Hazel like I could
[01:20:35] let Fishel out of it
[01:20:37] I mean Lisa
[01:20:58] oh
[01:21:02] he's still finding teams it's important
[01:21:04] because this is going to be for the
[01:21:05] whole future of the account we're
[01:21:06] committing
[01:21:12] we know what our team's gonna be if we
[01:21:14] don't use dendro but if we do use dendro
[01:21:17] dude if I had yeah yeah this would be so
[01:21:19] good I could use Cola but it's like
[01:21:21] Coley with kaching works but kolei in
[01:21:23] like a normal team is like not that much
[01:21:25] of time
[01:21:39] what if we do what if we do chat what if
[01:21:41] we do sucrose
[01:21:46] I can't even pull for a dental character
[01:22:12] what if we got a denture character with
[01:22:13] a Singapore could you imagine can you
[01:22:15] imagine can you imagine
[01:22:20] what's up
[01:22:36] check store well I don't know who the
[01:22:38] four stars are this month I'm gonna be
[01:22:40] honest
[01:22:44] official shangling that's actually good
[01:22:46] we could maybe get official but I don't
[01:22:48] plan on pulling
[01:22:52] can't even buy these bro I'm actually
[01:22:57] I actually am broke
[01:23:02] maybe we should pull
[01:23:14] okay I don't I want to go to my main
[01:23:17] account I don't want to stall anymore so
[01:23:18] let me just finish this okay if we are
[01:23:21] playing dendro we'll do denture MC and
[01:23:23] then we'll do dandrum c sucrose special
[01:23:25] Syncro maybe beta whatever and then
[01:23:28] instead of special and then here we'll
[01:23:30] just use like
[01:23:32] five Albedo no that won't that won't be
[01:23:34] enough
[01:23:39] I actually don't know what we would do
[01:23:41] here like literally Hazel on fav I'm not
[01:23:44] even kidding this would be bad
[01:23:47] so we cut it
[01:24:01] official has a battery first half so
[01:24:03] official is a secondary battery but the
[01:24:06] thing with farazon is like you also need
[01:24:08] another battery
[01:24:11] like
[01:24:15] okay I know where if Amazon's not geared
[01:24:18] okay but like just look at like how
[01:24:20] little energy we're gonna get just look
[01:24:24] uh these guys give it I mean slaves give
[01:24:27] energy but still everybody stand back
[01:24:32] I'll even
[01:24:34] if I was on
[01:24:36] we'll see about that
[01:24:40] like okay I know we didn't really build
[01:24:43] much yard on her yet okay but like she
[01:24:46] does not get energy she literally
[01:24:48] doesn't
[01:24:53] be about that
[01:25:00] so we're gonna get one burst per patch
[01:25:12] wait do I have a five lands for Xiao
[01:25:15] please no I don't want to play it please
[01:25:16] okay thank God
[01:25:19] okay anyways I'm just gonna leave it at
[01:25:21] that I don't want to stall for too long
[01:25:22] so I think our teams are gonna be
[01:25:29] shall far is on first half and then
[01:25:33] taser second half or dendro hyperbloom
[01:25:35] depending on the characters we have and
[01:25:37] over pull for now I'm thinking Hazel for
[01:25:39] taser because sucrose is occupied
[01:25:43] uh or like some dead drumsy thing
[01:25:47] we can like talk about it more as we go
[01:25:49] that's like the plan for now because
[01:25:50] having a rough plan is important to not
[01:25:52] waste resources
[01:25:54] okay time to swap accounts
[01:25:57] wait actually let me spend 20 more resin
[01:25:59] just to uncap what should we do chat
[01:26:01] we need a domain because we have the X2
[01:26:07] and I'm gonna farm for Mass off Stream
[01:26:09] So doing like artifacts on stream is not
[01:26:12] that dumb
[01:26:15] all the time yeah sorry
[01:26:21] and you can dance no
[01:26:24] um
[01:26:25] tf's good right because we can play TF
[01:26:27] or TS we can TS Beto or TS
[01:26:31] well I mean we're gonna emblem Beto do
[01:26:32] any of them for anyone else [ __ ]
[01:26:35] okay
[01:26:39] both these are good for official
[01:26:46] no official could just strong box it
[01:26:48] though
[01:26:51] yeah we need that bump dude I don't have
[01:26:52] emblem I don't have it
[01:27:03] okay
[01:27:23] Vermillion could be good because we
[01:27:24] could use the two-piece on Fishel
[01:27:26] uh gilded is also really good
[01:27:30] like gilded and deepwood is good but the
[01:27:33] problem is
[01:27:36] I don't know if we're actually playing a
[01:27:38] dendro team like I don't know if we're
[01:27:39] gonna use our DMC or if we're gonna use
[01:27:42] her as anemo
[01:27:57] it's safer to go emblem dude
[01:28:04] Farm Mora did I have a lot of more
[01:28:05] though look look
[01:28:09] I have 11
[01:28:12] wait that's one million I mean okay
[01:28:14] maybe it's not that much
[01:28:19] okay we'll do one more line
[01:28:24] I'll do one
[01:28:32] the problem is it's resin efficient okay
[01:28:34] gilded and deeper are very resigned but
[01:28:37] I don't know if I'm gonna be playing a
[01:28:40] dendro team and if I'm not then spending
[01:28:42] my resin there will make us not progress
[01:28:45] as fast anime hey what is this team by
[01:28:48] the way oh yes because I'm not official
[01:28:51] I press Bennett
[01:29:06] boring
[01:29:28] [Music]
[01:29:32] we'll do gilded
[01:29:34] what's wrong with gilded Guild's good
[01:29:45] ain't no way he's plunging the dirt
[01:29:51] this is our responsible account chat
[01:29:54] this is our responsible accounts
[01:29:57] swamps
[01:30:02] get our burst because we have enough VR
[01:30:04] and then
[01:30:06] you only get the correct lament voice
[01:30:08] line if you do everything perfectly so
[01:30:10] if you're not lamenting as often as me
[01:30:12] on shout you're doing something wrong
[01:30:25] As You Wish
[01:30:32] how did he die
[01:30:34] it's pink it's actually ping it's
[01:30:36] actually pink actually pink actually
[01:30:38] think they've actually picked up
[01:30:39] actually think they've actually picked
[01:30:40] the thing they picked up
[01:30:47] let's light it up stand clear
[01:30:54] okay okay so far so good so far so good
[01:30:56] so far so good good the main good domain
[01:30:57] is that all you've got
[01:30:59] that's gonna hurt me wait Chad I need to
[01:31:01] get a sapwood blade what are the odds of
[01:31:03] me

[01:31:07] prototype absorption
[01:31:12] Eagle conquering no well unfortunate
[01:31:20] are on our request oh well
[01:31:25] yeah I'm doing that I'm gonna do that
[01:31:27] one yep
[01:31:38] all right moment of truth
[01:31:42] this could be good actually could be
[01:31:43] good even the two piece could be good
[01:31:46] uh
[01:31:48] yeah
[01:31:49] you can use deepwood four stars doesn't
[01:31:51] matter too much and keep like this
[01:31:53] could be good
[01:32:03] okay low-key the more I think about it
[01:32:05] the more I could Ching team would be
[01:32:06] easy to build but I think we're just
[01:32:08] gonna stick to what I my guns okay let
[01:32:11] me swap accounts
[01:32:17] we will resume the free to play one next
[01:32:19] stream
[01:32:21] I'll progress off stream I just wanted
[01:32:23] to like start give you guys like a taste
[01:32:25] of what's to come
[01:32:26] and then we'll be doing it
[01:32:29] probably either at the start at the end
[01:32:31] of streams
[01:32:35] let me do dailies and on cap resin and
[01:32:37] then we'll probably do the uid reviews
[01:32:38] and then I'll do resin spending maybe in
[01:32:40] Abyss run and uh wanna oh yeah we're in
[01:32:42] Water Swimming Island
[01:32:45] with kokomi
[01:32:48] hernation this island just came out by
[01:32:50] the people wondering that's why our
[01:32:52] Explorations at 33 Yoshi Ori is 100
[01:32:54] because this one already released
[01:32:55] earlier I completed everything that's
[01:32:57] out but water to me just came out with
[01:32:59] kokomi's rerun already being at 33 is
[01:33:01] actually impressive I'm sorry I did that
[01:33:03] off stream but we will get it to 100 now
[01:33:05] because it literally came out with
[01:33:07] kokomi's Banner so yeah
[01:33:09] uh our resin got capped probably so uh
[01:33:11] while I was on the Free Play account so
[01:33:13] not my fault yeah I have to go up there
[01:33:15] that was a lie by the way it was capped
[01:33:17] when I started stream but
[01:33:22] okay let's start by getting this this
[01:33:24] this
[01:33:26] one Fury

[01:33:56] wait you can't climb that yeah you can
[01:34:00] does it matching jump better that's what
[01:34:01] I did I didn't hold space
[01:34:06] watch I'll do it I'll get it without
[01:34:08] even
[01:34:26] where is it okay let me climb up
[01:34:31] it'll be too easy if I don't do this so

[01:34:34] I'm too talented okay we're gonna go
[01:34:45] was that to the right or to the left I
[01:34:47] couldn't even tell wait where am I I'm
[01:34:48] to the right I'm to the right onto the

[01:36:21] go we're gonna explore this island later
[01:36:23] uh because it just came out with kokomi

[01:37:41] what is this
[01:37:43] what the [ __ ] is dangerous location is
[01:37:45] this an event it's probably an event
[01:37:57] wanted to be island was released in 2021
[01:38:00] and now it's 2023 what the hell is he
[01:38:03] talking about first message okay listen
[01:38:05] here buddy listen here okay listen here
[01:38:07] pal you might be playing on a different
[01:38:09] version of the game but in my against an
[01:38:11] impact so sumeru came out a bit ago
[01:38:14] we've we finished exploring most of it
[01:38:15] Inazuma came out right now but they're
[01:38:18] releasing it one Island at a time so we
[01:38:20] just finished Yoshi Ori watatsumi came
[01:38:22] with kokomi Yoshi already came with uh
[01:38:25] uh YULA and now with water you know
[01:38:27] that's not for me to do it with Clee
[01:38:29] because that was the last Banner the
[01:38:31] last in the Zuma bet who's lost with Ito
[01:38:33] uh we got Yasha Island and then water to
[01:38:35] me just came out with kokomi so that's
[01:38:36] why we're doing that
[01:38:37] foreign
[01:38:42] wait did I miss yeah this game sucks
[01:38:55] we go
[01:38:58] it's gonna be this one [ __ ]

[01:41:52] using okay
[01:41:53] sorry
[01:42:12] that's far enough
[01:42:25] we'll meet again
[01:42:29] happy
[01:42:32] this is underground right yeah no okay
[01:42:42] I feel sorry for this guy's neighbors
[01:42:44] dude they can't hear me
[01:42:56] The Wind Rises
[01:43:00] quit following me
[01:43:07] everybody
[01:43:16] search for it
[01:43:18] cool oh wait it's not done
[01:43:30] sorry I'm saving my voice from the juid
[01:43:32] reviews I'm like I'm saving
[01:43:35] we're about to do it but I have to pee
[01:43:37] so bad I just don't want to get up until
[01:43:38] we're ready
[01:43:45] someone said you look like Barbie
[01:43:47] literally no one said that you're making
[01:43:49] that up so that I read your comment
[01:43:53] [Music]
[01:43:56] add ass
[01:43:59] rabbit sauce
[01:44:03] add
[01:44:05] ass
[01:44:07] add a strawberry sauce
[01:44:14] oh
[01:44:15] so imagine playing normal attack Scara
[01:44:17] when with charge attacks you could do
[01:44:24] I saw people getting mad at the Jeff for
[01:44:25] saying Wanderers should spam charge
[01:44:27] attacks
[01:44:28] this is why this is what I did and then
[01:44:30] I saw a theory crafting war between n2c
[01:44:33] and CA spam and the intricacies of the
[01:44:36] difference in AOE that the the the the
[01:44:38] center of both attacks is different and
[01:44:41] also the the different places that each
[01:44:43] entail and the true answer so this is
[01:44:45] like that's like the theory crafter take
[01:44:47] right or you could have the ziox take
[01:44:49] where it's you could use n2c or charge
[01:44:51] tax spam and then you don't need to
[01:44:53] think more of it because both are fine
[01:44:54] and then you move on see how much brain
[01:44:56] power I just saved by just saying that
[01:44:58] hey dude that's that's like the dude
[01:45:01] it's like it's like too easy to be me
[01:45:03] sometimes but also
[01:45:06] why isn't it working also
[01:45:11] I have a question
[01:45:15] so the guy who did a 45 minute child
[01:45:17] guide yeah because Xiao deserves it
[01:45:20] but okay it just depends like it's it's
[01:45:22] not a clear-cut answer feel that's
[01:45:23] basically a great answer are dumb
[01:45:25] because the aoes actually it's bigger it
[01:45:28] feels bigger than it actually is because
[01:45:29] though in practice it's different
[01:45:31] because the center of the attacks are
[01:45:33] different so it's actually like bigger
[01:45:34] than you think but also if you play
[01:45:36] scarra as a charge attacker why are you
[01:45:38] using Scott it's a it's like a Hazel or
[01:45:40] a sucrose skin or it's like a worse
[01:45:41] trout if you're spamming chargebacks I
[01:45:43] feel like oh it's actually just shout
[01:45:44] out but different because he's better
[01:45:46] with venti okay when has venti been
[01:45:48] relevant [ __ ] you but it's like so it's
[01:45:50] like usually like when you pull for
[01:45:52] scarra like the purpose is different
[01:45:54] it's like scarra becomes good
[01:45:56] like scar is decent right but it's like
[01:45:58] he's not bad scar is decent it's just
[01:46:00] like if you use him to play a hyperloom
[01:46:03] team why are you playing him like okay
[01:46:05] you can play who you like but like it's
[01:46:06] just a sucrose skin and then if you use
[01:46:08] him to play like charge attack spam it's
[01:46:10] like
[01:46:11] it could be his best playstyle and it's
[01:46:14] fun and you do so I like it I do that
[01:46:17] but at the same time it's like it feels
[01:46:19] like at that point he's just Shout
[01:46:21] but not as much DPS still fine
[01:46:26] but then it's like if you're normal
[01:46:27] attacking then he feels like okay he can
[01:46:29] make use of more supports he can use
[01:46:31] sync show better you can use visual
[01:46:33] yolan better he can use like freeze
[01:46:35] teams better he can also question mark
[01:46:38] Xiao ain't better surely surely scarra's
[01:46:41] AOE is just as good it's actually the
[01:46:43] same you're right scar is normal attacks
[01:46:45] AOE is actually so big people are
[01:46:47] underrating it it's actually as big as
[01:46:49] ciao you're right you're actually right
[01:46:50] enemies group that easily and his charge
[01:46:52] attack doesn't displace them and as far
[01:46:53] as on C6 actually groups them because
[01:46:56] Frozen C6 groups and it's so good that
[01:46:58] scarra actually's AOE will hit
[01:47:00] everything and also her C6 definitely
[01:47:02] will displace them and also venti can
[01:47:04] definitely pull everything together by
[01:47:06] the way
[01:47:07] anyways that's not the point uh my point
[01:47:09] was I think scarra becomes like a really
[01:47:11] cool character when you're playing him
[01:47:13] in a play style that other characters
[01:47:14] don't play so like I think when you
[01:47:16] either end to C or get his weapon and
[01:47:19] n3c M3 just N3
[01:47:21] then he becomes like kind of
[01:47:23] distinguished like yeah he's just flying
[01:47:25] Hazel but like and you can get like a C2
[01:47:27] like C1 C2 which I don't think are
[01:47:29] needed but I think like at that point he
[01:47:32] becomes like a very like
[01:47:34] unique character but if you charge that
[01:47:35] spam he kind of feels like
[01:47:37] I don't know
[01:47:41] I don't know
[01:47:42] like
[01:47:43] this is coming for someone who charged
[01:47:45] back spams like I think it's funny
[01:47:46] because you just
[01:47:50] like I just like just found this I think
[01:47:51] it's fun but I feel like he's like less
[01:47:53] of a character when you do that
[01:48:01] coma Shield needs an a at that too
[01:48:04] let's move on maybe no nobody brought
[01:48:06] this up I just chose to talk about it
[01:48:07] because I felt like talking about it
[01:48:10] [ __ ] you I'm not moving on
[01:48:14] uh what they want to craft so I want to
[01:48:16] craft the thing
[01:48:19] [ __ ] it we're gonna do one strong box
[01:48:22] we'll do a daily bullet actually no
[01:48:24] we'll do Crimson witch actually comes
[01:48:25] witch we'll do one
[01:48:39] you are comparing C6 ciao you are
[01:48:41] delusional well you have you have
[01:48:44] delusions
[01:48:46] yeah
[01:48:47] also his set and a lot of his weapons
[01:48:49] want him to normal attack so like in
[01:48:51] practice and a lot of his support So in
[01:48:53] practice a lot of people get more like
[01:48:55] yeah unless you're playing him and just
[01:48:57] like
[01:48:59] I mean if you're playing on this team it
[01:49:00] doesn't matter you just
[01:49:06] okay uh I need to talk about my resin
[01:49:08] we'll do for a million
[01:49:10] just once
[01:49:14] he's fun because fly I think scar is
[01:49:16] very fun to explore with and to run
[01:49:18] around with and to do short fights with
[01:49:20] I think the fact that he flies
[01:49:22] is annoying in Abyss because if you get
[01:49:25] knocked for some reason he just was like
[01:49:27] and then he comes back up which is fine
[01:49:29] if you're under Shield
[01:49:30] so usually you have to run a shield but
[01:49:32] I don't like being forced on Shield I
[01:49:34] find it annoying
[01:49:48] but I also I don't like the sentence I
[01:49:50] just said where it's like
[01:49:52] I don't like having to play a character
[01:49:54] optimally he's like I get it just
[01:49:55] [ __ ] play Shield but I find it
[01:49:56] annoying but you can Tom or Layla or
[01:49:59] Jonathan Lee I guess
[01:50:11] yeah that's why I need a shield
[01:50:17] okay I don't know I put coconut salt
[01:50:20] it's a popcorn in my team okay it's not
[01:50:22] that's not my fault
[01:50:28] that's also a problem of using
[01:50:30] um reminiscence is you can't panic
[01:50:33] button
[01:50:35] okay this doesn't
[01:50:38] okay one more
[01:50:40] did you review where we're literally
[01:50:42] right about to I just want to get a good
[01:50:43] Vermillion fast just one run
[01:50:49] but I don't know
[01:51:09] [Music]
[01:51:13] haha
[01:51:14] incite me insects
[01:51:17] follow me
[01:51:30] but yeah
[01:51:32] pretty good
[01:51:34] actually no this can't be good
[01:51:37] I don't know why I said that could be
[01:51:39] good okay one more then I'll tell you
[01:51:40] either
[01:51:44] yeah I like running like you can run for
[01:51:46] freeze teams or you could run Layla like
[01:51:48] you're growing like either two cry or
[01:51:49] like one cry one Hydro it's actually not
[01:51:50] bad like Layla can work you can get crit
[01:51:52] rate and like Rosario too
[01:51:55] um
[01:52:01] well
[01:52:04] I just think when you
[01:52:18] but I also I know that I enjoyed scarra
[01:52:22] a lot more when I got C6 bars on like
[01:52:25] maybe that's just like bias or something
[01:52:26] but I know like personal experience
[01:52:28] he's like so much more fun as he's as
[01:52:30] far as on
[01:52:40] can you actually
[01:52:42] oh yeah no yeah I know actually
[01:52:45] missed a stream of my family were in the
[01:52:48] crash there okay don't worry but your
[01:52:50] stream is keeping me sane oh Sage I'm
[01:52:53] glad they're okay inside of this
[01:52:57] okay one more one more then I'll go one
[01:52:58] more awesome
[01:53:03] in essence on for um what is it
[01:53:13] minus say to weary
[01:53:27] it's far enough
[01:53:33] Adventure Time
[01:53:38] it's like okay
[01:53:40] [Music]
[01:53:43] like I love Wonder but if you're so if
[01:53:45] you're charged back spamming he's he's
[01:53:47] horizontal chow and if you're normal
[01:53:49] attack spamming he's just flying sucrose
[01:53:51] so it's like pick your play style why
[01:53:53] did that do no damage yeah it's like
[01:53:55] pick your play style bro
[01:54:00] that was my fault I [ __ ] very
[01:54:02] reminiscence
[01:54:14] why not both I consider I consider n2c
[01:54:17] normal attacks
[01:54:18] so when you know attack you usually do
[01:54:20] two normals into a charge unless you
[01:54:21] have a signature weapon or some other
[01:54:23] [ __ ]
[01:54:24] like when I say no attack you're still
[01:54:25] charge hacking but it's like
[01:54:27] because doing this can sometimes be
[01:54:29] better
[01:54:36] I need to make sure I have
[01:54:37] procranescence
[01:54:46] wait can I even proc it [ __ ] please okay
[01:54:50] cool
[01:54:53] I should run a shield
[01:55:01] this game sucks
[01:55:03] I should run a shield
[01:55:05] I'm sorry I'm on the shield next time
[01:55:11] just like a Dodge attack
[01:55:15] know your place
[01:55:31] try flying higher with scarra
[01:55:34] ah okay ah
[01:55:38] okay here's the problem with flying high
[01:55:39] on Scara so first of all Let's ignore
[01:55:42] the fact that sometimes if the enemies
[01:55:43] are like tiny sometimes scarra will just
[01:55:46] like attack and Miss by the way other
[01:55:49] than that it's a waste of like one third
[01:55:51] of your stamina bar
[01:55:59] I mean you could do it but it's like
[01:56:01] yeah
[01:56:04] what is cardio no damage that isn't bad
[01:56:06] okay okay fine we'll do one more clear
[01:56:08] double the idea review
[01:56:10] it's not bad I'm just doing a bad
[01:56:11] because okay let me put a shield here
[01:56:13] sorry kokomi I love you I don't want to
[01:56:15] take you out of the team but we have to
[01:56:18] where are we headed this time
[01:56:22] no energy they don't have energy
[01:56:25] okay I don't have energy okay that's
[01:56:27] fine
[01:56:27] it's almost on fav
[01:56:36] ORS
[01:56:44] okay this is without an artifact set
[01:56:46] we're just running some stats right now
[01:56:48] there's no artifacts that are mascara
[01:56:49] well two features
[01:56:54] like his damage isn't bad but we also
[01:56:56] have like
[01:56:58] how do you know if you proximate it
[01:57:00] drains energy so if your energy isn't
[01:57:02] drained it's because it's too low
[01:57:21] foreign
[01:57:27] Defender but
[01:57:30] I'm I'm being honest I'm being dead ass
[01:57:32] here
[01:57:35] scarra as a hyper carry is like
[01:57:38] significantly more dependent on farzan
[01:57:41] and her C6 than Xiao is hyper Curry
[01:57:43] because if you don't have that a lot of
[01:57:44] people say okay you can still play
[01:57:46] farzan but you could also just play them
[01:57:47] in like a free steam or singtro yolan or
[01:57:50] like [ __ ] taser or whatever
[01:57:53] it's not even it's literally like
[01:57:55] objectively true and then but at that
[01:57:57] point if you're playing them four of you
[01:57:58] in that team he's fine
[01:57:59] but it's just a skin for sucrose who's
[01:58:01] better not significantly better but a
[01:58:04] bit better because they have spread
[01:58:07] so what do you mean so what do you mean
[01:58:09] so
[01:58:11] you can't install Xiao for something
[01:58:13] then I say okay but scar is more like in
[01:58:16] the defense of Scar and I say scar is
[01:58:17] more dependent on that and then you say
[01:58:18] so
[01:58:22] I think he's sick I think he's fun I
[01:58:24] think he's cool I think he's good for
[01:58:26] exploring I'm just saying I'm just
[01:58:29] staining the both sides relax
[01:58:32] relax
[01:58:38] so what a chad
[01:58:41] okay let me go connect last resin but
[01:58:43] that's the piece so bad why haven't I
[01:58:45] gone yet
[01:58:51] quit following me
[01:58:53] can't critique him did I critique
[01:58:55] everyone
[01:58:57] I critique everyone
[01:59:04] wait I don't have [ __ ] Crystal flies
[01:59:14] critique Xiao he's too tall it's [ __ ]
[01:59:17] annoying your head Clips on a bunch of
[01:59:18] [ __ ] you can't see him half the time
[01:59:21] because he's jumping too high
[01:59:25] it's annoying he's like so [ __ ] tall
[01:59:27] and makes other people feel short
[01:59:29] it makes people insecure
[01:59:44] okay to be fair though I I as the like
[01:59:47] biggest animal lover right I love animal
[01:59:49] and farazan made my favorite characters
[01:59:51] better I [ __ ] hate farazan I hate
[01:59:55] fart I okay I don't [ __ ] talk many
[01:59:57] characters I like wander I do I like
[01:59:59] your email she's cute I hey
[02:00:03] far not like visual but like her kid I
[02:00:07] [ __ ] hate her kid dude she's
[02:00:09] literally oh my dude without her C6 it's
[02:00:12] like you're playing a character who like
[02:00:15] how do I say this in the nicest way
[02:00:16] possible it's like you're playing a
[02:00:17] character who is like meant to ride on a
[02:00:20] horse as a Cavalier but they fell off
[02:00:22] their horse and then their horse kicked
[02:00:24] them and now they're riding on like a
[02:00:25] guinea pig that's what you're playing
[02:00:27] it's not
[02:00:30] but without the [ __ ]
[02:00:38] the horser C4 uh the pig has boots so it
[02:00:42] doesn't hurt itself and then C6 you get
[02:00:44] the horse back
[02:00:55] the disrespect on my Miku
[02:00:58] listen
[02:01:00] I love Animo I just don't like that it's
[02:01:03] like gate kept like Caesar farzones not
[02:01:06] fine but it's okay like it's viable like
[02:01:08] it works you still play it and Shout
[02:01:10] triple enema teams you still played in
[02:01:12] some skara teams like you could do skara
[02:01:13] farzan and then like another anyway you
[02:01:15] can do jeans on fire you could do venti
[02:01:17] scars go to Venti if the enemies are
[02:01:18] displaceable kazua but especially with
[02:01:20] c65 like it's fine but it's like it's
[02:01:23] not fine because you're literally
[02:01:25] gatekeeping an entire character like
[02:01:27] dude her C6 is like insane it's
[02:01:30] literally a new character because people
[02:01:31] forget how much this does it's not just
[02:01:33] like the Sara C2 like this is Sarah C2
[02:01:35] right the first part but then the other
[02:01:37] part is like oh you can also run Millis
[02:01:38] now and you group enemies and you
[02:01:41] generate energy that's four things in a
[02:01:43] C6 and then there's also C2 and also C4
[02:01:48] I hate it it's like gatekeeping on Nemo
[02:01:50] players like I don't care because after
[02:01:52] C6 but I care because then whenever I
[02:01:55] like I don't know I care for you guys
[02:01:58] but [ __ ] you guys
[02:02:00] you smell go shower sniffer
[02:02:08] huh
[02:02:16] Jordan big buff at c0c2 yes I know like
[02:02:18] I know xiaomanes are like yeah I still
[02:02:20] play farzan I know scar mates like yeah
[02:02:21] you can play fires like I know like you
[02:02:22] can still play her it's just I hate the
[02:02:25] difference I hate it I [ __ ] hate it I
[02:02:27] hate how without C6 your best goblet is
[02:02:30] whichever main stat okay ignore I don't
[02:02:32] know why I'm on this your best goblet is
[02:02:34] whichever one when you filter by ER
[02:02:36] comes up first if it's Electro you go
[02:02:38] Electro if it's a hydro you go Hydro
[02:02:41] it's I'm not even kidding by the way
[02:02:43] that's literally how you build her
[02:02:45] it's okay though
[02:02:52] however we are gonna play our free to
[02:02:54] play count and our free play has these
[02:02:56] zero fars on
[02:03:00] Xiao is still short and bad even with C6
[02:03:02] power is on true not true if I say true
[02:03:04] it's gonna get clipped
[02:03:06] but [ __ ] you
[02:03:12] five piece tenacity I don't know what
[02:03:14] why she's on this goblet I'ma be real we
[02:03:16] could give her any more damage sure sure
[02:03:18] uh animal damage and then ER
[02:03:22] do I have one
[02:03:25] yeah I do yeah but like my my kokomi and
[02:03:28] wander like rerun video is coming out
[02:03:31] like tomorrow it should have been out a
[02:03:32] few days ago it's coming out tomorrow
[02:03:33] and like it's pretty positive like I
[02:03:35] love kokomi and it's pretty positive in
[02:03:37] terms of Scara too like I don't have
[02:03:39] much bad to say about him it's just the
[02:03:40] bad things I have to say about him I
[02:03:42] have to say them but then when I say
[02:03:44] them some people get mad it's like I
[02:03:45] have to say it like I have bad things to
[02:03:46] say my child too
[02:03:48] I have to say though fall 10 is [ __ ]
[02:03:50] in like two weeks
[02:03:52] you don't want to pull for a character
[02:03:54] without knowing everything and then
[02:03:55] fonten comes they're like well I guess I
[02:03:57] have to spend money
[02:03:59] same with kokomi
[02:04:01] kokomi's only downside is that she's too
[02:04:03] pretty
[02:04:06] dude I'm watching I've been watching
[02:04:08] [ __ ] I've been watching [ __ ]
[02:04:09] psychic K right and there's a apparently
[02:04:12] there's a there's a girl in it called
[02:04:13] kokomi and she has a fan club there's
[02:04:15] literally a kokomi fan club it's
[02:04:17] actually insane
[02:04:19] I didn't know this
[02:04:22] that's literally us
[02:04:33] was Tom on Verizon because sub stats
[02:04:35] that's all I just filtered by ER
[02:04:39] um but
[02:04:49] I say I feel like that's what I say
[02:04:51] forget
[02:04:56] I hope you watched it dubbed
[02:05:01] I did not
[02:05:07] yeah chat for most people if you're
[02:05:09] wondering which crit ratio is better
[02:05:12] other than like attack em ER like those
[02:05:14] stuff matter but if you're just
[02:05:15] wondering which create ratio is better
[02:05:16] and you're comparing two just multiply
[02:05:18] criterate from time script damage
[02:05:20] and then whichever has the bigger number
[02:05:21] like obviously the other sub stats
[02:05:22] matter too and like set effect other
[02:05:25] [ __ ] team but usually just [ __ ]
[02:05:27] multiply them
[02:05:34] I did this off stream yo I did it clear
[02:05:37] with Ryden Nikita call me three
[02:05:39] characters only I was like I want to
[02:05:41] just do this for background footage I
[02:05:42] did I actually did it was cool
[02:05:44] because when I was talking about kokomi
[02:05:46] I was like yeah you can just play in
[02:05:47] like you know hyperbloom so I was doing
[02:05:49] that I put on [ __ ] clam
[02:05:51] foreign
[02:05:59] uh yeah no one can answer that question
[02:06:01] generally you want it to be your Hydra
[02:06:03] character like kokomi or Barbara and you
[02:06:05] stack them on em but some teams is a
[02:06:06] deadro but that's not as good but it
[02:06:08] depends on your team okay cool I have to
[02:06:09] go pee baby
[02:07:54] hey guys I'm back
[02:08:01] not underscore sorry donated three
[02:08:04] dollars hey chat back again to give you

[02:08:56] Forest
[02:08:59] I need the berries man these shits are
[02:09:02] impossible
[02:09:04] they're not even that hard to get but
[02:09:08] can you review you for once dude my last
[02:09:10] UND reviews EU wasn't it
[02:09:18] I don't look like Albert Einstein okay
[02:09:21] calm down
[02:09:22] [Music]
[02:09:24] I missed that uh rebozo that's deserved
[02:09:27] I can't lie I'll do it you recount
[02:09:29] review just for you okay
[02:09:39] type your uid I'll put it Inca fine
[02:09:42] that's your payment for being a mod
[02:09:45] but after this your pay is being halved
[02:09:49] and I probably already have to before so
[02:09:51] it's gonna be half of zero divided by
[02:09:53] another half so half of half of zero
[02:10:10] you know what I realized the other day
[02:10:12] what I find is funny is like there's
[02:10:13] some characters that you can like hate
[02:10:15] on and some people agree some people
[02:10:17] don't right it's like if someone's like
[02:10:18] oh like [ __ ] Xiao some people will be
[02:10:20] like based other people will be like nah
[02:10:22] [ __ ] you okay but then there's a few
[02:10:24] characters that literally everyone
[02:10:27] rallies behind like one of the Jeff's
[02:10:29] mods I'm not gonna say who but had the
[02:10:32] bad decision of saying nah nilu's ugly
[02:10:35] and everyone was like no [ __ ] you
[02:10:37] capital D colon you're ugly not nilu
[02:10:41] and in that moment I was like
[02:10:43] I'm I'm proud same with like kokomi
[02:10:46] kokomi Nation I think they did her dirty
[02:10:48] in the story Quest but I didn't do the
[02:10:49] story Quest because I choose ignorance
[02:10:51] as it is bliss
[02:10:53] I have just heard
[02:10:57] the Yeti's pinned okay
[02:11:00] I'll [ __ ] anchor it
[02:11:08] okay fine
[02:11:09] okay before we look at this chat mind
[02:11:11] you
[02:11:16] this deluke main has been asking me to
[02:11:20] do EU account reviews for probably two
[02:11:22] years now okay so if I don't see near
[02:11:25] perfect artifacts or something of beauty
[02:11:29] this is not just gonna be an unmod but
[02:11:31] this is gonna be a band
[02:11:33] for my time and for yours
[02:11:38] 900 achievements
[02:11:47] wait this looks pretty insane well
[02:11:49] beginner that reads the the ritzy kind
[02:11:51] of inflates it but still
[02:11:53] yeah that's good some em 110
[02:11:56] I mean
[02:12:01] sorry Anka's like hard for my brain what
[02:12:02] is this
[02:12:05] [ __ ] you I'm not wasting my voice on you
[02:12:07] no I'm not
[02:12:15] not Vermillion
[02:12:24] okay this is a denture goblet [ __ ] you
[02:12:26] it also has em and attack [ __ ] you this

[02:12:57] 100 I have zero
[02:13:18] okay that was pretty disrespectful to
[02:13:19] yai but the rest is pretty pretty insane
[02:13:22] that wander is busted
[02:13:24] wait why are you on Twin why are you on
[02:13:35] well yeah I'll hide them is getting here
[02:13:37] it looks good so based
[02:13:39] I don't want to talk about other
[02:13:40] characters
[02:13:48] We're not gonna talk about twin nephrite
[02:13:50] that is like a nahita weapon if anything
[02:13:58] it's not a Nikita weapon you wouldn't
[02:14:00] run this on the heater
[02:14:05] this [ __ ] magic guy that you can use
[02:14:06] on her where's Magic guide

[02:14:47] quit following me wada Sumi for kokomi
[02:14:50] oh good idea

[02:14:55] I started the stream I was here but I
[02:14:57] moved let me check my team
[02:15:11] foreign
[02:15:25] 50 of the 100 then the other 50 will be
[02:15:27] another server probably Asia because I

[02:26:00] okay
[02:26:05] actually not bad the ratio looks worse

[02:26:12] next one
[02:26:15] oh a top shangling wait hopeful I know
[02:26:17] you all right
[02:26:20] okay
[02:26:21] let's look at this this is a top
[02:26:23] shangling so first of all she's not even
[02:26:25] ascended what is this okay this is a
[02:26:28] scam she's not even ascended
[02:26:31] your pirate is level 11.
[02:26:36] when this far from home oh brother I
[02:26:40] will
[02:26:42] stop for scarlet sounds
[02:26:44] that's good
[02:26:45] for emblem that's good
[02:26:48] I'm expecting something I'm expecting
[02:26:50] something staggering
[02:26:52] that's good every subset is useful
[02:26:55] oh yeah this is why I wish I didn't main
[02:26:58] shell don't get me wrong I love Xiao
[02:27:00] okay I love I hey hey I love Shout
[02:27:05] but imagine if I made a character who
[02:27:07] used a set that other characters used
[02:27:09] imagine if I played a character who
[02:27:12] made a character who
[02:27:13] use the emblem all of my teams would
[02:27:16] look good this is really good also I
[02:27:18] could unmute alerts because I know a lot
[02:27:20] of people are like annoying stuff uh
[02:27:22] I'll go through them in a second
[02:27:25] foreign
[02:27:27] that's good it's better than it looks
[02:27:29] because the it's actually a lot of
[02:27:30] Korean yeah that's actually really good
[02:27:31] [ __ ] you I'm mad now why am I mad when
[02:27:33] someone has good artifacts why does it
[02:27:34] upset me this is pretty decent
[02:27:39] also pretty decent a lot of these pieces
[02:27:40] are like I just spit over all these
[02:27:42] pieces don't look that good but then
[02:27:43] it's like a lot of the stats are useful
[02:27:45] like attacks useful emcs
[02:27:48] yeah it's actually good
[02:27:50] that's actually really good because none
[02:27:52] of your stats are wasted
[02:27:53] like even on your pieces I'm like like
[02:27:55] this every sounds good every stats good
[02:27:57] every stats
[02:27:59] at this point yeah I mean except for HP

[02:28:29] single one of your [ __ ] shangling
[02:28:30] pieces has like no you useless subset
[02:28:33] except the one you don't have one bad
[02:28:34] subside your flat HP is useless
[02:28:36] everything else good good
[02:28:39] good and then good with flat attack
[02:28:41] that's not even like useless yeah that's
[02:28:44] good
[02:28:46] but I don't think you actually play
[02:28:48] shangling because she's not even
[02:28:49] ascended
[02:28:50] wait let's look are other characters

[03:07:20] balance your good rate a little I know
[03:07:22] it's not that easy but like surely one

[03:07:52] uh
[03:07:56] uh best DPS kokomi and Kirara what why
[03:08:00] are you
[03:08:07] sure black sword isn't even 90.

[03:08:28] husbando whale based you can't chat how
[03:08:32] many times I have to say this you can't
[03:08:34] just
[03:08:36] type something about yourself and then
[03:08:37] call yourself based that's not how it
[03:08:40] works that's not however looking at your
[03:08:42] character list this is looking pretty
[03:08:43] based
[03:08:44] is are they actually a whale
[03:08:50] yo what the [ __ ]
[03:08:53] R1 weapons not wait not even
[03:08:55] um
[03:08:57] okay they actually are a [ __ ] husband
[03:08:58] collector
[03:09:00] all right let's look at um
[03:09:02] I don't even know who to start with
[03:09:03] let's look at ciao
[03:09:05] okay that's a good flower
[03:09:06] that's a [ __ ] insane feather holy
[03:09:09] [ __ ]
[03:09:14] you think that's funny actually that
[03:09:16] hurts oh my God I was gonna be like holy
[03:09:18] [ __ ] this is insane but also imagine if
[03:09:20] this is [ __ ] familiar you missed the
[03:09:22] 50 50. dude that hey that [ __ ] hurts
[03:09:25] that hurts hey all right and if anyone
[03:09:28] can bully you it's me because I spent a
[03:09:29] hundred thousand resin and I still don't
[03:09:31] have a piece like that
[03:09:37] anyways good show
[03:09:39] yeah really good shot a lot of er too
[03:09:41] okay you what I forgot your C6 you don't
[03:09:44] actually need that much ER but it's good
[03:09:45] good job
[03:09:47] um Triple Crown okay
[03:09:49] so you need to Luke I rarely see a good
[03:09:51] look Beacon of the Red Sea that's good
[03:09:54] um
[03:09:56] wow that's [ __ ] insane
[03:10:02] and there's attack on it
[03:10:04] that is also insane
[03:10:06] oh my God what is this the Luke
[03:10:09] Luke my voice didn't crack your ears did
[03:10:12] uh yeah it's good
[03:10:17] that's good you're
[03:10:19] ELC your em is a little low
[03:10:21] but that commercial is [ __ ] stupid
[03:10:23] the hell C6 Triple Crown two all right
[03:10:26] look at one more one more one more one
[03:10:27] more let's look at it I like that maybe
[03:10:28] light a fully decision
[03:10:31] for gilded triple crowd
[03:10:34] that's insane
[03:10:36] it's also insane
[03:10:37] also insane
[03:10:40] wait
[03:10:43] well sorry if you love like such good
[03:10:44] gilded sets ah dude it's good
[03:10:49] get on them
[03:10:53] that's probably the best item we've seen
[03:10:57] look at my other characters find love XD
[03:11:00] fine
[03:11:01] what are your other characters
[03:11:04] Homa four Crimson witch
[03:11:07] that's good
[03:11:10] that is mediocre at best
[03:11:13] that's really good
[03:11:22] what is this
[03:11:24] 18 criterate
[03:11:27] what is this
[03:11:28] 18 times 2 is 36.
[03:11:32] almost 37 with a 0.3
[03:11:36] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:11:38] no way the Dory mate has this
[03:11:49] that goblet's also really good because
[03:11:50] it's on set with 82 a.m like it could be
[03:11:52] better but for onset it's really good
[03:11:54] uh
[03:11:56] uh this is a perfectly perfectly
[03:11:58] balanced feather hey it's even 13 13.
[03:12:02] that's good I mean this flower is stupid
[03:12:05] it's insane but the rest is just pretty
[03:12:07] good
[03:12:08] oh it's good eighty two two four and
[03:12:11] it's really hard for Houma hotel to have
[03:12:12] 80 crit rate like it's really rare
[03:12:14] because you get so much great damage on
[03:12:16] Hotel
[03:12:21] okay let me look at another best ciao n
[03:12:23] a okay [ __ ] you by the way for saying
[03:12:25] that because I'm right here all good
[03:12:27] though all good
[03:12:29] let's have a homo four Vermillion okay
[03:12:34] double crown not even triple
[03:12:37] disrespectful but all good
[03:12:41] that's good
[03:12:43] that's really good
[03:12:44] that's really good
[03:12:46] that's good
[03:12:48] that's really good no if you have a good
[03:12:50] Vermillion
[03:12:51] must be nice
[03:12:53] all right Curtis a bit low though like
[03:12:55] Shadow doesn't really have an excuse to
[03:12:56] be local grade I know you're on homo but
[03:12:58] like his Ascension passes could rate
[03:13:00] so like
[03:13:02] I mean I guess your Goblin has no
[03:13:03] criterate and you're
[03:13:06] yeah your flower doesn't either I guess
[03:13:08] that's unlucky but also at this point
[03:13:11] you probably have a sense so okay this
[03:13:12] is actual advice your offset piece
[03:13:15] shouldn't be this you're guaranteed you
[03:13:17] haven't uh a piece on your account are
[03:13:19] you what air are you yeah you're 60. you
[03:13:21] for sure have a Sans that's attacked
[03:13:24] with more crit rate than like crit
[03:13:26] damage or like at least more to balancer
[03:13:28] ratio because when you're this High
[03:13:29] investment more crit damage isn't going
[03:13:32] to do nearly as much as more crit rate
[03:13:35] um
[03:13:38] wait are all your stats [ __ ] crit
[03:13:39] right okay well
[03:13:41] okay maybe not we'll see though I mean
[03:13:44] like I I don't know
[03:13:48] uh next one wait did I miss any I missed
[03:13:51] there was only one kid bits I did miss
[03:13:53] one sorry uh ellsrich says
[03:13:57] putau go h p o o
[03:14:00] the [ __ ] does that mean
[03:14:03] what the [ __ ] did that mean Homer
[03:14:06] c0 One Crown okay
[03:14:20] okay I mean it's glad people get a lot
[03:14:22] of glad vlad's been out forever
[03:14:25] but also what the [ __ ] is this
[03:14:29] Heather
[03:14:32] that's great damage I thought my eyes
[03:14:34] played tricks on me
[03:14:35] that's good
[03:14:37] okay also really yeah this is actually
[03:14:39] really good what the hell that ER is
[03:14:41] low-key wasted but it doesn't matter if
[03:14:42] you have 56 em I had a pretty good crit
[03:14:45] amount and it's on set so pretty good
[03:14:47] 119 DM total that's good uh uh oh you're
[03:14:50] on an HP circuit
[03:14:52] it's viable
[03:14:54] but it's not as good
[03:14:56] but these are insane substance
[03:15:00] yo even without a crit Circle it you
[03:15:03] actually have really good songs I would
[03:15:04] say like Honestly though like
[03:15:06] if this was a crit rate circlet
[03:15:09] you would have action insane ratio but
[03:15:12] still even just like this it's really
[03:15:13] good
[03:15:14] um
[03:15:15] is there Yolanda on HP circuit no
[03:15:19] that doesn't make sense
[03:15:28] but I have to catch up on some
[03:15:37] last joke true with the outfit based
[03:15:40] lost prayer to our cake too glad
[03:15:43] okay
[03:15:45] okay
[03:15:49] this is pretty good uh I mean pretty
[03:15:51] decent you certainly kind of sucks balls
[03:15:52] I'm not gonna lie
[03:15:55] um keep in mind two God is only 18
[03:15:57] attacks so so you can make up for it
[03:15:59] with a substance or another set but very
[03:16:01] good
[03:16:01] that's pretty good where is it
[03:16:07] I'm saying yeah better than any hutao
[03:16:09] okay I don't know about that one those
[03:16:11] are fighting words but let's look proud
[03:16:13] member of kokomi nation respectable
[03:16:16] combination rise
[03:16:20] thundering pulse Horsemen hours
[03:16:23] double ground
[03:16:27] let's look at it
[03:16:29] that is an insane flower okay that is an
[03:16:32] insane feather okay

[03:54:31] a lot of Adventure characters want ER
[03:54:33] okay
[03:54:42] a lot of the ones that want ER could use
[03:54:44] like Fab so Critter would be better
[03:54:46] damage but hey it's still good yours
[03:54:48] good
[03:54:51] if you are but it's still good yours

[03:55:27] one more [ __ ] damage we'll be okay
[03:55:33] we already have enough VR

[03:56:28] dangerous supports that want ER I build
[03:56:30] on like
[03:56:31] just ER and crit rate for fav like I
[03:56:33] don't give some damage but for the ones
[03:56:35] that want damage these are good
[03:56:37] throw away the four star piece on MC now

[03:57:39] I forgot yeah it's good easy
[03:57:42] all right not bad
[03:57:44] we can actually use this on her
[03:57:47] hanky
[03:57:53] wait what the [ __ ]
[03:57:58] whatever
[03:58:04] trip over water or slaver Fontana
[03:58:06] characters stop ignoring me I have a
[03:58:08] video literally called that coming out
[03:58:11] hopefully tomorrow
[03:58:14] um I just need to keep editing it but
[03:58:16] tldr
[03:58:17] it's up to you I love that answer no but
[03:58:20] like listen
[03:58:22] do you already have two DPS characters
[03:58:23] you like
[03:58:24] okay then skip the other DPS if not then
[03:58:27] you can get one if you want
[03:58:32] he's good enough to play if you like but
[03:58:34] he's not good enough to where you should
[03:58:36] feel like you need him that's basically
[03:58:37] him
[03:58:41] why does nahida need 1000 em it's not a
[03:58:44] need it's a want
[03:58:45] basically
[03:58:47] time you're under a thousand PM it's
[03:58:49] good because it'll uh buff you like
[03:58:52] patience
[03:58:53] and if you're oh wait let me let me
[03:58:56] explain this better because it's hard to
[03:58:57] just say buff you it's because of her
[03:58:58] passive her passive will convert her em
[03:59:01] to two things one well three things
[03:59:03] it'll give her criterate and
[03:59:05] um
[03:59:08] this thing whatever the [ __ ] this does
[03:59:09] yeah it'll give em to your team okay two
[03:59:12] things I don't know why I said three
[03:59:13] oh no bonus damage that's what it is
[03:59:15] damage percent criterate and it gives
[03:59:16] your team em so three things
[03:59:19] so all Fields stacking yams the best and
[03:59:22] it also okay that's not it it also Buffs
[03:59:25] your [ __ ] scaling and it Buffs any
[03:59:27] reactions you may be procking on the
[03:59:28] heater
[03:59:30] so you don't want to go over a thousand
[03:59:32] yam but if you're under a thousand em is
[03:59:35] always either a good option or the best
[03:59:36] option
[03:59:40] that's only on field no well it's
[03:59:42] through your on-field character so it
[03:59:44] it's
[03:59:45] uh wait no sorry let me rephrase that
[03:59:47] it's your highest uh okay it's the
[03:59:50] highest em on your team to your onfield
[03:59:52] character which is usually going to be
[03:59:53] Nikita like Nikita is usually gonna have
[03:59:54] the most they have on her team unless
[03:59:55] you're playing nearly bloom
[04:00:01] sorry I'm tired explaining it's hard
[04:00:06] usually yeah
[04:00:12] why are you playing ahita kuki I mean
[04:00:14] depends what weapon you have on cookie
[04:00:17] like a five cookies not gonna have more
[04:00:18] ER but it does I mean maybe it doesn't
[04:00:20] really matter you still want to Stack
[04:00:21] again off field but stacking game is
[04:00:24] about as good like it's usually off
[04:00:26] field it's usually slightly better than
[04:00:28] going crit and attack uh not attack
[04:00:30] sorry uh yeah but going crit and dental
[04:00:33] damage so it depends on soft stats on
[04:00:35] field
[04:00:37] like it's it's very close so it depends
[04:00:39] like I have like I don't have a good
[04:00:42] um
[04:00:44] yeah like I have a really good [ __ ] ton
[04:00:45] of em on a feather but then for like
[04:00:47] goblet my dental is really good so he's
[04:00:49] my dead one type of thing so I'm On Em
[04:00:52] dendro crit but going yeah Triple M is
[04:00:54] like more simple it just depends it's
[04:00:56] literally always the M sounds that go
[04:00:58] based on subsides then go based on sub
[04:01:00] stats on field dandruff crit is like
[04:01:03] slightly better but it's still pretty
[04:01:04] even and then off field em is like
[04:01:07] slightly better but again it can be
[04:01:08] pretty even so it just depends
[04:01:13] but it's usually a bit better to go em
[04:01:15] especially off field
[04:01:19] depends how you play her you should
[04:01:20] probably level her normals
[04:01:22] actually no I don't really I don't feel
[04:01:24] sure that much
[04:01:34] hey man
[04:01:36] hey
[04:01:39] glad to have you
[04:01:40] this could be good I think these are

[04:04:23] how do I say this
[04:04:27] let's say you're like taking a stroll
[04:04:30] okay and you see someone who's in danger

[04:04:46] me up your friend your homie
[04:04:50] I'm a good person I would
[04:04:53] I would
[04:04:54] no someone a moderator gifted 20 Subs
[04:04:58] says socks please do Vermilion in this
[04:05:01] instance it would be basically letting
[04:05:04] someone die if I don't go to Vermilion
[04:05:06] it would be taking money that could be
[04:05:08] used for something for a good cause and
[04:05:11] stabbing them
[04:05:13] so we're gonna go do for a million but
[04:05:15] let me look at some resin first

[04:05:47] like dying
[04:05:49] and you don't help them you're like you

[04:10:28] they gave us all
[04:10:30] the odd language when you're doing the
[04:10:31] simulated Universe would you like to
[04:10:33] enter the Forgotten Hall when you're
[04:10:35] doing the simulated Universe it
[04:10:36] literally lets you have the long
[04:10:38] description or the razor language one
[04:10:40] it's actually sick
[04:10:55] ah
[04:11:03] four pieces surely one of them will be
[04:11:06] good
[04:11:09] man this could be good
[04:11:31] bro so down bad he locked a three liner
[04:11:34] with one crit okay kameos
[04:11:38] now not everyone is as privileged as a
[04:11:42] whale
[04:11:44] like you
[04:11:46] better break this down so you can
[04:11:47] understand when I was a young child a
[04:11:50] toddler
[04:11:51] an adolescent
[04:11:52] I got a lava Walker goblet now this
[04:11:55] level Walker goblet didn't look that
[04:11:57] good it had defense percentage defense
[04:12:02] flat and critical rate
[04:12:06] who would go who would level that that's
[04:12:08] not good but then plus four it got crit
[04:12:11] damage suddenly could rain in crit
[04:12:13] damage on a goblet okay interesting then
[04:12:17] to plus 20 it only rolls great and now
[04:12:20] it looks like this and from this is a go
[04:12:23] by God in patch 1.0 from the lava Walker
[04:12:26] domain and now it is still equippedable
[04:12:31] because hey it unlocked that final stat
[04:12:35] of a second crit value and now
[04:12:39] maybe we'll get that on Vermillion who
[04:12:41] knows
[04:12:42] I don't know until I try and that's the
[04:12:45] point you never know until you try
[04:12:57] you said unlock her damage okay I [ __ ]
[04:12:59] it up it was crit rate that it unlocked
[04:13:00] how would I know
[04:13:02] okay
[04:13:20] okay
[04:13:22] well
[04:13:24] it was still worth a shot like you can't
[04:13:26] you miss every shot you don't take so
[04:13:27] [ __ ] it
[04:13:29] might as well take a shot

[04:27:31] them should I also upload them to tick
[04:27:33] tock I just I'm afraid of that platform
[04:27:36] but I could just have him manage it and
[04:27:37] then just upload it because it's like
[04:27:39] free content
[04:27:41] like I know you like it's
[04:27:43] I just don't know like I'm afraid man
[04:27:46] every night no that's from Tick Tock is
[04:27:48] like afraid of it or it's like the
[04:27:50] community like not the community but
[04:27:51] like the like you get banned for no
[04:27:53] reason and like there's a lot of like
[04:27:55] weird [ __ ] not a weird [ __ ] but like
[04:27:57] I don't know
[04:28:02] do you understand yes or never
[04:28:12] it's like I want to but I have to make
[04:28:15] sure that I don't
[04:28:18] but I'm Gonna Cancel The Raid and
[04:28:20] re-rade because I want to be able to
[04:28:21] talk a little bit more sorry I cancel
[04:28:22] the rape I'll redo it
[04:28:24] um I want to make sure I don't make my
[04:28:27] okay because I assume you can cut like
[04:28:30] I want to make sure I don't
[04:28:35] change what I want my community to be
[04:28:39] because I know there's like like in
[04:28:41] every like platform there's like a lot
[04:28:43] of different type of people I want to
[04:28:45] make sure my community stays what I want
[04:28:48] my community to be
[04:28:53] which is fine because I can just post
[04:28:55] the like nor the most sane Clips on
[04:28:58] multiple platforms
[04:29:01] I also
[04:29:04] wanna make sure don't bring them here
[04:29:06] it's not it doesn't matter that people
[04:29:08] from
[04:29:10] it won't change to a chat don't worry
[04:29:14] but I just need to make sure I don't end
[04:29:16] up in a position where I feel like I
[04:29:19] can't criticize a character because
[04:29:21] people will be like you're talking bad
[04:29:22] about my comfort character that is my
[04:29:23] biggest fear in life
[04:29:25] changing my audience to that so as long
[04:29:28] as it's not that we're chilling like as
[04:29:29] long as I could be like yeah like
[04:29:33] you know
[04:29:35] cave is always that I'll hide them and
[04:29:37] no one's mad at me it's fine
[04:29:39] but I know it won't be that we'll see I
[04:29:42] don't know I haven't decided yet
[04:29:44] we might try it
[04:29:46] we'll see I don't know
[04:29:53] it's so bad trust me
[04:30:05] I'm a nice guy though I'm not gonna say
[04:30:08] anything bad the only the only thought
[04:30:10] okay the only time I remember people
[04:30:12] being mad at me
[04:30:15] was being mad at their showcases but
[04:30:17] like I was like you know
[04:30:19] I was justifiable in being mad at their
[04:30:22] show kisses
[04:30:23] I wasn't mad at the people doing it I
[04:30:25] was mad at the people that would take it
[04:30:26] out of context and get mad at me for
[04:30:27] calling their bad it's like bro I won't
[04:30:29] dare to be good look at her
[04:30:31] I like that more than you like damn
[04:30:33] let me complain
[04:30:44] foreign
[04:30:47] I have no clue
[04:30:49] I mean it doesn't matter though because
[04:30:50] like [ __ ] like that I can I don't need
[04:30:52] to post like I don't need to post
[04:30:54] everywhere I just keep on streaming it
[04:30:55] doesn't matter like I can cater I can
[04:30:57] choose what I post where so I mean it
[04:30:59] doesn't really matter
[04:31:17] already poster clips
[04:31:32] I'm just a surprise
[04:31:41] talk so well to Showcase numbers and
[04:31:43] Justified that character I mean it
[04:31:44] doesn't matter okay YouTube was full of
[04:31:46] that before I started okay do you know
[04:31:48] what dude that's part of the reason why
[04:31:49] I started YouTube literally all I saw
[04:31:51] about gentian was like whales flexing
[04:31:52] how much they could whale or how good
[04:31:53] their whale characters are I was like
[04:31:55] but now it's not like that anymore
[04:31:58] and now people understand like there's
[04:31:59] disclaimers like people understand I
[04:32:01] assume they're two people understand
[04:32:02] what it I mean okay no comment for legal
[04:32:04] reasons but like you know
[04:32:06] there's a difference like okay I don't
[04:32:09] mind whales stroking whale things that's
[04:32:11] all fine I just don't like it when other
[04:32:14] people take that and use it as an
[04:32:15] argument for why their character is good
[04:32:17] because like I can't mislead people
[04:32:19] that's my but but like
[04:32:22] clips iox and guide dogs are different
[04:32:25] like I'm the same person but like me
[04:32:28] making sure I give good advice on a new
[04:32:30] character and try to be honest and
[04:32:33] criticize like I'm making my new next
[04:32:35] video is going to be kokomi and Wanderer
[04:32:37] should you pull right I'm very honest
[04:32:39] with it like I say a lot of good things
[04:32:41] about wander but I also say the bad
[04:32:42] things like yeah sometimes you get
[04:32:43] interrupted if you're not running a
[04:32:44] shield [ __ ] he's not like
[04:32:47] he's like as a hyper carries kind of
[04:32:49] depend on c64 is on you're playing
[04:32:50] without it you can play other teams but
[04:32:51] like you kind of want it he's not like
[04:32:54] game breaking he's decent he's good
[04:32:56] enough if you like like you know like
[04:32:57] I'm nuanced but then it's like
[04:33:00] as Clips I'm not gonna make one I'm not
[04:33:02] gonna make a clip being like I played
[04:33:04] wander without a shield I wanted to jump
[04:33:05] off a cliff like I'm not gonna make that
[04:33:07] it's true I did and I did want to do
[04:33:10] that but I'm not going to make that
[04:33:12] I still like him I like wander
[04:33:15] is cool
[04:33:18] the thing I don't like though as I was
[04:33:20] saying is when people take
[04:33:25] content that other people make like
[04:33:27] content that like let's say whales make
[04:33:29] because they want to showcase their
[04:33:31] whale character with food whatever like
[04:33:33] it's fine you can make that it's
[04:33:34] entertainment but I don't like when
[04:33:36] people take that and then bring it to me
[04:33:38] as like oh look at this number that I
[04:33:41] saw this character is good that pissed
[04:33:43] me off people do that with Eula to the
[04:33:46] other characters but with other
[04:33:47] characters I was never really like
[04:33:49] I like a lot of characters are just good
[04:33:52] and I don't need to like criticize or
[04:33:53] like I can criticize but I don't need to
[04:33:54] like start a debate about but Dale was
[04:33:57] like objectively bad
[04:33:59] and Eula wasn't bad but she was like
[04:34:02] people were pretending like she was
[04:34:03] better than every other character when
[04:34:04] she came out
[04:34:07] uh but anyways
[04:34:10] so it's like
[04:34:12] yeah
[04:34:15] well it's not about the content it's
[04:34:16] about like the
[04:34:20] it's not about the content it's about
[04:34:22] the like
[04:34:24] what people take from it like if I made
[04:34:28] a video right now that said okay
[04:34:30] a new top five DPS video and I put
[04:34:33] [ __ ] like who's the character that's
[04:34:35] not number one like I don't know [ __ ]
[04:34:37] let's have okay I was gonna say um yeah
[04:34:38] but that's toxic to your moments I'm
[04:34:40] sorry I love you guys I'll give you guys
[04:34:41] a break uh let's say [ __ ] I don't
[04:34:43] know
[04:34:44] random character let's not put to Luke
[04:34:46] number one right I'd like I don't know
[04:34:48] let's not put like child and I explained
[04:34:50] well child's good but he's not
[04:34:52] I'm not gonna start this debate again
[04:34:53] let's have a sign of there I'm like yo
[04:34:55] you guys don't understand the power of
[04:34:56] Sino quick Bloom it's good in AOE it
[04:34:58] also has a good single Target TF gives a
[04:35:00] [ __ ] ton of energy on field he has the
[04:35:01] most energy generation on field outside
[04:35:03] of like TF Bennett and then I just gave
[04:35:05] a bunch of [ __ ] reasons to make it
[04:35:06] look legit okay
[04:35:08] not true but there would be a good
[04:35:10] amount of people that would because I am
[04:35:13] credible which I'm glad that I'm
[04:35:15] credible and there's nothing that's like
[04:35:17] literally when I upload a video a guide
[04:35:19] I like refresh it for like two hours to
[04:35:22] see if I forgot anything out and then I
[04:35:24] checked it's like it [ __ ] with my
[04:35:25] mental but anyways because I'm generally
[04:35:28] credible
[04:35:30] some people would be like would use that
[04:35:33] in other people's streams and then be a
[04:35:34] dick about it be like oh do you see that
[04:35:36] like oh like Santa's better and it would
[04:35:38] like start [ __ ] that's what people do
[04:35:40] with whale showcases sometimes and it
[04:35:42] tilts me
[04:35:50] 700 complex words people believe you
[04:35:52] it's more about the confidence look
[04:35:54] listen
[04:35:56] okay yeah I'm sure I was better than
[04:35:57] sucrose because you can do more personal
[04:35:59] damage and then you can just go five
[04:36:00] lands and sucrose doesn't really go
[04:36:01] [ __ ] fast because you're not building
[04:36:02] crit on her but you can go five trials
[04:36:04] and you have good personal damage so you
[04:36:05] play shot on a shallow team and then you
[04:36:07] go forward with the vendor so you can
[04:36:08] swirl Electro and hydro because you're
[04:36:10] playing hyperbloom while normal attack
[04:36:12] canceling before every plunge because
[04:36:13] you don't lose any frames doing that you
[04:36:14] can normal as you jump normal plunge
[04:36:16] boom you hit a good AOE which is pretty
[04:36:18] big you can also displace enemies you
[04:36:20] can plunge so in the air you don't take
[04:36:21] damage whereas sucrose has like no
[04:36:23] [ __ ] iframes on her burst she dies
[04:36:25] like paper and you can group everything
[04:36:27] you can give energy to your team with
[04:36:28] five and you don't need a battery
[04:36:29] because you're running five and you get
[04:36:31] to play Xiao
[04:36:32] see now everyone's playing Charlotte
[04:36:34] invest in Charlotte today
[04:36:38] it's actually not bad though like I was
[04:36:40] kind of trolling the transaction not bad
[04:36:45] anyways I digress
[04:36:50] talk [ __ ] about ziox not his credibility
[04:36:52] okay
[04:36:53] what does that mean
[04:36:54] [ __ ] you
[04:36:57] no but like with my blade video for
[04:36:59] example so like look like I uploaded my
[04:37:00] play video
[04:37:02] and I had re-watched this a few times
[04:37:03] but then I noticed that I noticed two
[04:37:06] things like through just like were you
[04:37:08] watching like look at the comments
[04:37:10] because I was yeah it I was just like
[04:37:12] every time I upload a guide I'm like
[04:37:15] kind of like need to make sure like I
[04:37:17] watched like 15 times though like is it
[04:37:19] good that I like a costume stuff and I
[04:37:20] noticed at one point I said [ __ ] I
[04:37:22] cut it out but I literally noticed that
[04:37:24] like I think I said I want to talk about
[04:37:25] planet ornaments everything I said was
[04:37:27] fine with that at one point I said like
[04:37:29] 12 instead of eight like I just said the
[04:37:31] wrong number but then I just went to
[04:37:32] YouTube Studio I cut it out so it's not
[04:37:33] there anymore but like [ __ ] like that
[04:37:36] it's like any time there's a mistake
[04:37:37] like that that slides I'm like [ __ ] uh
[04:37:40] also there's one with like bronia I said
[04:37:42] like a wrong word and like cut that out
[04:37:43] too but anyways or asking for the pin
[04:37:46] comment if it's not like cuttable
[04:37:50] anyways okay that's all
[04:37:55] foreign [ __ ] you guys
[04:37:59] we'll see though
[04:38:04] don't be too hard yourself well it
[04:38:06] depends so if it's like a small mistake
[04:38:08] like the one that I put in the pickup
[04:38:10] the only one that's still in the video
[04:38:11] because that looks like this is like a
[04:38:12] one second cut it's just two uh was that
[04:38:15] I I said once when reading this I said
[04:38:18] lower instead of higher but like it
[04:38:20] doesn't matter like you know you can
[04:38:21] tell by reading it like it's fine but
[04:38:23] like
[04:38:26] worried that I make a mistake that's
[04:38:27] like relevant so like for example
[04:38:31] like
[04:38:33] if I [ __ ] up weapon ranking or like
[04:38:35] artifact stuff that's when it like like
[04:38:37] [ __ ] but like that basically doesn't
[04:38:39] happen anymore
[04:38:41] like sometimes I'll forget about
[04:38:43] something but like the last time like a
[04:38:45] big mistake happened was like Albedo and
[04:38:47] like [ __ ] 1.2 which is like two years
[04:38:49] ago but like yeah
[04:38:52] like sometimes things happens like I
[04:38:53] remember my first new video like I was
[04:38:56] like after making I was like oh [ __ ]
[04:38:57] like I realized Actually I don't even
[04:38:59] know if I I know I mentioned the new one
[04:39:02] um but like I realized like okay like I
[04:39:04] could have mentioned something I should
[04:39:05] have mentioned so I was like [ __ ] was
[04:39:07] you could do this right e then Auto auto
[04:39:09] and then e and it's faster than just
[04:39:11] spamming e
[04:39:13] but like that is the bonus thing I just
[04:39:16] added that there it's not like I [ __ ]
[04:39:17] up
[04:39:18] anyways doesn't matter there's a logic
[04:39:20] uh I gotta go well I don't but I'm tired
[04:39:22] I know there's a drive
[04:39:30] anyways we're gonna raid kitchen Mains
[04:39:32] because I said I was gonna do it like an
[04:39:33] hour ago and then I canceled it because
[04:39:35] I wanted to talk more
[04:39:37] thanks for watching
[04:39:42] um
[04:39:42] it's just a game no
[04:39:45] because misinformation can cause people
[04:39:46] to wail and then that's real money but I
[04:39:49] know like I know sometimes I take it a
[04:39:51] bit too seriously
[04:39:53] um which is why like I don't upload like
[04:39:55] I could upload so much more but it takes
[04:39:57] me so [ __ ] long to review a guide
[04:39:58] like I've had this video guide done for
[04:40:00] like 20 days but like I have can I show
[04:40:03] this
[04:40:08] like look this video is fully edited
[04:40:10] okay
[04:40:11] but now look at the [ __ ] I want to add
[04:40:13] again
[04:40:14] I'm leaking my notepad I don't care like
[04:40:17] re-record Talent make sure that bounce
[04:40:19] is okay same sentence twice redundant
[04:40:21] type of attack percent I said this
[04:40:23] whatever ER amounts on screens like it's
[04:40:25] like so much little [ __ ] and it [ __ ] it
[04:40:28] takes so long it's fine it's worth it
[04:40:32] yeah that's like after the video is
[04:40:34] edited like I'm adding [ __ ]
[04:40:36] thanks
[04:40:41] um
[04:40:44] and then also I don't shut the [ __ ] up
[04:40:46] so my videos are like 30 minutes and
[04:40:48] then I need to trim it to 20. but like
[04:40:49] sometimes I like should I just leave it
[04:40:51] long and then who cares I don't know
[04:40:53] that's the video guys I love y'all uh
[04:40:55] not pair of socially though we're gonna
[04:40:56] rate your chick mates
