[00:28:29] spaceship except
[00:28:38] like I'm think of like new
[00:28:41] characters it could be like a new four
[00:28:43] star but it's not Misha cuz Misha's from
[00:28:45] penan maybe a new F no it's probably a
[00:28:48] it's probably a five star who's like the
[00:28:50] last new character right before
[00:28:57] peny can't be Ron may wait let me look
[00:29:00] at the elements could be fire topaz
[00:29:02] where's topaz wait where the [ __ ] is
[00:29:03] topaz from topaz is hunt fire it could
[00:29:06] be her I don't know where the [ __ ] she's
[00:29:07] from though flavor of glue oh where's
[00:29:10] she from okay but that was a good guess
[00:29:13] wait that was actually could oh cuz of
[00:29:15] this it wasn't oh she's 1.4 oh it was
[00:29:17] ratio okay but I guess this ratio and
[00:29:19] tobaz are like the same thing cuz
[00:29:21] they're in the same team ratio and topaz
[00:29:23] it's like okay 1.4 my bad my bad I
[00:29:25] should have known I forgot about the
[00:29:26] version wait I didn't I didn't read the
[00:29:28] past and future are so similar uh wel

[00:57:29] been I can't remember every single
[00:57:31] trailer we watch that might be my
[00:57:32] favorite one although I like the when
[00:57:34] gian's boyfriend showed up with like the
[00:57:36] white
[00:57:37] hair
[00:57:39] um wait where is the I don't know why

[00:57:48] been prepared I mean I'm pulling
[00:57:51] so those bloody Exiles somehow figured
[00:57:58] anyways that was pretty
[00:58:13] good I like the puppet I think the
[00:58:14] puppet's pretty cool on top of just her
[00:58:18] uh normal stuff I think the pu's pretty
[00:58:23] cool wait does you have two earrings or
[00:58:25] one
[00:58:27] dude I'm telling you every G dude I'm
[00:58:28] telling you that you just add asymmetry
[00:58:31] to the
[00:58:35] characters it's always
[00:58:39] one I could be a character
[00:58:42] designer the puppet has her old
[00:58:45] eyes
[00:58:48] really what the [ __ ] are her old eyes
[00:58:50] before she became eltion what
[00:58:54] happened how do you pay attention to her
[00:59:04] lore Focus up
[00:59:07] okay we'll watch the firefight thing in
[00:59:10] like two hours chat we're we're wo for
[00:59:12] now well we might HSR later so we'll
[00:59:14] we'll watch the fire thing when we
[00:59:16] switch
[00:59:18] okay what thing I think there's a
[00:59:20] trailer or something I'll watch after
[00:59:27] why did this guy just DM me a monkey
[00:59:29] fight and said watch
[00:59:32] this this is 4
[00:59:35] minutes you want me to watch you do a
[00:59:37] 4minute boss fight tear them
[00:59:53] toie this audio quality is terrible by
[00:59:55] the way
[00:59:58] wait did
[01:00:05] yous okay minus one outro
[01:00:15] skill it to
[01:00:18] me okay it's lagging wait yo okay
[01:00:24] wait is it even dude is it even better
[01:00:26] DPS to [ __ ] swap cancel because if
[01:00:28] you do you lose the outro
[01:00:30] buff I feel like it's not worth is it
[01:00:33] you get like how okay what's the bonus
[01:00:34] that you get from it you
[01:00:36] get I don't know I can figure out
[01:00:38] later like I feel like you should only
[01:00:40] do on yeah last
[01:00:43] one no flame I know it's just casual
[01:00:45] gameplay but you
[01:00:47] you yo I'm not opening this
[01:00:51] link okay I opened it what what is on
[01:00:54] your desk okay there's too much booba
[01:00:55] here I'm sorry I can't okay we're
[01:00:56] pulling Yin pull this is our first uh no
[01:00:59] we're at like roughly 20 or 30
[01:01:01] pity Yin only does like 60% of your
[01:01:04] damage if you don't quick swap yeah I
[01:01:05] know but like that's why but calara only
[01:01:07] does like you know 30 pity okay
[01:01:14] 30
[01:01:15] okay unlucky we got a four start it's
[01:01:18] better to
[01:01:21] okay what if you just didn't play calaro
[01:01:24] [Music]
[01:01:30] [Music]
[01:01:39] okay second time Bol if these are purple
[01:01:42] then it could have been mortifies so it
[01:01:44] better be go oh my God why am I pulling
[01:01:45] on this Banner it could have just been
[01:01:47] mortify I could have had mortifies but
[01:01:50] no now I'm going to get [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:01:52] uh Yan woo
[01:01:54] [Music]
[01:01:57] it's okay I'm leaving this here for
[01:01:58] viewer attention give me a second let me
[01:02:00] sip sip my coffee dude remind me not to
[01:02:02] have an energy drink before bed I
[01:02:04] literally woke up every like two hours
[01:02:05] at the start with like my I felt my
[01:02:07] heart and then Can You Feel My Heart and
[01:02:11] then I went to sleep again I SLE like 12
[01:02:16] hours do a thumbs up for the
[01:02:21] thumbnail okay
[01:02:23] sorry should I do the devs listen
[01:02:40] face okay but hot take I think Yin it's
[01:02:43] probably isn't even a hot take I think
[01:02:44] yilin doesn't even have like feel like
[01:02:46] yin's good but she's missing a character
[01:02:49] that seriz with her well like the the
[01:02:52] character that synergizes the best with
[01:02:53] her is like a dog [ __ ] fourstar the
[01:02:56] that's who has the worst scalings in the
[01:02:58] game like she's good but I think she's
[01:03:01] only going to get better like I I don't
[01:03:03] think that makes her bad if anything
[01:03:04] I'll just make her
[01:03:05] better cuz like calaro you're either
[01:03:07] hurting his damage or you're hurting her
[01:03:09] damage Gan you're either hurting his
[01:03:10] damage or you're hurting her damage
[01:03:12] Encore sure but Encore is like you don't
[01:03:15] get the buff of like the electro bonus
[01:03:16] and whatever the
[01:03:18] [ __ ] anyways another
[01:03:21] Temple I don't have a single Alto so one
[01:03:24] Alto would be fine honestly
[01:03:29] okay I'm
[01:03:33] done does this game any good I like it
[01:03:36] chat likes it Commando of conviction
[01:03:44] okay dude sin stop you are literally
[01:03:48] calaro prop propaganda
[01:03:50] brainwashed he doesn't he he cized with
[01:03:54] her but he if you swap out one you lose
[01:03:56] a [ __ ] out of his
[01:04:00] Synergy imagine an electro character
[01:04:03] Actually I don't even know what she
[01:04:04] would need may maybe maybe she's
[01:04:07] just maybe they just need to make the
[01:04:09] outro skill not lose on Swap [ __ ]
[01:04:11] another
[01:04:13] Temple okay five star and then we get
[01:04:15] mortify five star and please please
[01:04:17] please have we tried the Coliseum yeah
[01:04:19] we did it all

[01:05:25] feet
[01:05:28] wait what just happened also mods just
[01:05:31] gave points to believe to doubters I
[01:05:33] probably would have refunded if that was
[01:05:34] me but hey fair enough I'm not blaming
[01:05:36] mods my
[01:05:38] bad I did technically lose but it's okay
[01:05:42] it's okay scammed rib
[01:05:45] Bozo we did lose first though to be fair
[01:05:47] we did
[01:05:48] lose what the wait what wait is that
[01:05:52] maybe that's sponsored lock you can have
[01:05:54] this lock too exclamation Mark what
[01:05:56] sorry sorry what the [ __ ] hello hello
[01:06:03] hello wait let me tweet
[01:06:07] this
[01:06:13] yinlin dude it's not just same tful it's
[01:06:16] literally back to back
[01:06:36] sponsored account it's my account is
[01:06:43] normal rectifier yinin is a skilled
[01:06:47] patroller and Powerful natural resonator
[01:06:49] after being suspended from her duties at
[01:06:51] the public Security Bureau she must now
[01:06:53] pursue hidden evils in secrecy
[01:06:56] oh that's why she has disguises I guess
[01:06:58] now pull for
[01:07:02] weapon string
[01:07:05] master um would you have swi you didn't
[01:07:07] get her yeah I want y then I would have
[01:07:09] gotten her no matter
[01:07:11] what my myang is
[01:07:23] dead hey he
[01:07:32] wait what the
[01:07:35] [ __ ] wait look if I Mouse one
[01:07:41] wait oh maybe it was just bugging I was
[01:07:43] like I wasn't
[01:07:47] clicking
[01:07:49] oh well I didn't know that's I mean this
[01:07:51] just a wa mechanic it's not Ying but if
[01:07:52] you attack and
[01:07:54] you you can like cue the
[01:07:56] input like look I only I only Mouse one
[01:07:59] once like I'm not pressing to plunge I
[01:08:01] don't know that was a
[01:08:02] thing
[01:08:04] anyways
[01:08:08] um I ya an entire defense of calaro in
[01:08:11] your DMs okay okay I get what you're
[01:08:13] saying man I [ __ ] you sorry sorry sorry
[01:08:16] sorry the outro deepens are so
[01:08:21] overrated okay that's fair but you okay
[01:08:23] okay okay okay okay okay fair I'm just
[01:08:25] saying I'm just saying you lose a bit if
[01:08:27] you swap out and you lose a bit if you
[01:08:28] don't swap out does that make sense does
[01:08:30] that make sense like if you swap out you
[01:08:31] lose something and if you don't swap out
[01:08:32] you lose something but swapping out is
[01:08:33] still better but you still do lose
[01:08:35] something like there's no like perfect
[01:08:37] Synergy yet well I guess your kit makes
[01:08:39] it to where you want to swap but you
[01:08:40] also want to stay on the
[01:08:47] buff the most meta team okay no but Gan
[01:08:51] look like Gian is perfect because
[01:08:53] mortify Buffs him and he's just Bing
[01:08:54] chilling
[01:08:56] you have to swap out
[01:08:57] anyways
[01:08:59] um well you don't have to for
[01:09:04] Garo I mean I I guess it does give
[01:09:07] energy you're right I mean does it do
[01:09:09] you care I mean I guess you care but
[01:09:12] it's also
[01:09:15] like calaro Mains people talk about him
[01:09:18] more than actually playing him true
[01:09:20] sorry sorry sorry sorry no but this is
[01:09:23] good to know I mean I can look into it
[01:09:25] more later
[01:09:25] yes you do you just get hit and
[01:09:28] staggered yeah but also I'm going to be
[01:09:31] honest this is going to look so there's
[01:09:33] the I get the like the the sheet damage
[01:09:35] take where it's like okay in practice
[01:09:38] you have to swap but also in practice
[01:09:40] it's a lot harder to get a good calaro
[01:09:42] rotation
[01:09:43] than in paper on
[01:09:46] paper but I agree it's probably optimal
[01:09:48] to still swap like I'm not
[01:09:50] disagreeing I just wish I didn't have
[01:09:52] to I mean we can test it out later okay
[01:09:55] anyways I I bought the battle pass
[01:09:57] weapon
[01:10:00] um well I didn't I didn't claim it yet
[01:10:10] actually
[01:10:14] oh it's not here wait where the [ __ ] is
[01:10:17] it is it here no wait it has to be here
[01:10:21] what does it look like I thought it
[01:10:22] would be a box yep box
[01:10:26] hello where's my box
[01:10:32] hello oh it's
[01:10:36] this okay chat am I getting her okay am

[01:10:57] her weapon's crazy I know but like dude
[01:11:00] it's like
[01:11:02] $100 fine maybe we will but like this is
[01:11:04] the second best option well third best
[01:11:06] option but second best if you aren't
[01:11:07] considering another five
[01:11:12] star Yin damage during the swaps is also
[01:11:14] more damage than the damage you lose
[01:11:16] from deepen outro which you aren't
[01:11:17] getting anyways have you tried on
[01:11:18] Fielding this [ __ ] throughout
[01:11:19] his whole outs against tough enemies

[01:12:01] second of all you have verden Summit if

[01:44:52] probably energy the ice active is
[01:44:53] [ __ ]
[01:44:54] penis
[01:44:57] but I mean it does more damage than
[01:44:59] [ __ ] what's his
[01:45:01] name it does more damage than this guy's
[01:45:03] entire kit but it's not
[01:45:08] great unsponsored oh [ __ ] okay Heron's
[01:45:11] really good though I so I don't know I'm
[01:45:14] sure both are viable but the
[01:45:15] impermanence Heron is very good for uh
[01:45:17] for uh just teams for support characters
[01:45:20] in general to buff your main damage
[01:45:22] dealer although in this game there's a
[01:45:23] lot of different sources of damage
[01:45:24] there's no just like one main DPS
[01:45:26] although GN is one but you get what I'm
[01:45:28] saying uh so uh uh uh uh uh
[01:45:48] yeah oh they're dead wait I didn't get
[01:45:50] to play the team okay okay
[01:45:57] uh we'll do another
[01:46:02] one is z Ms viable I don't like calaro
[01:46:05] see that is very based of you I'm sorry
[01:46:07] I'm sorry I'm sorry uh I mean like yeah
[01:46:11] but like I feel like unless you're
[01:46:13] literally unless your kit literally says
[01:46:15] you cannot swap out you probably should
[01:46:17] just quick swap anyways like you can do
[01:46:19] Basics on her she has like five enhanced
[01:46:21] Basics I think
[01:46:24] um but like you can always run someone
[01:46:26] else that you can just swap into like
[01:46:27] Havoc MC or
[01:46:29] like if you want to buff for Basics you
[01:46:31] can play
[01:46:33] [ __ ] sonano
[01:46:38] but
[01:46:44] top top
[01:46:54] minus 10 [ __ ] you cow sorry I like that
[01:46:58] you don't have to pick up the like the
[01:47:00] [ __ ] you get from killing
[01:47:06] enemies uh Karo I need to make sure he's
[01:47:09] geared cuz we're actually going to play

[03:54:34] either we can either do the new memory
[03:54:37] of chaos or we could do the genin
[03:54:41] quest or we could maybe do the 2.2 Quest
[03:54:44] but I feel like that would take way too
[03:54:45] long cuz it's 3:00 a.m.
[03:55:20] someone said memory of chaos for Boot
[03:55:22] Hill content no disrespect but I
[03:55:25] literally cannot play the reason I can't
[03:55:27] play booill is cuz I didn't do 2.2 so I
[03:55:29] don't have the boss mats so I can't
[03:55:30] unlock his traces also the week just
[03:55:32] reset so it's kind of cooked

[04:51:45] POV fix the stream title protect the
[04:51:48] guests within the Dreamscape but I
[04:51:51] witnessed a group of organic life forms
[04:51:54] making their way to the theme park and
[04:51:57] soon after a rip tore through the sky
[04:52:01] and Black Rain started leaking out of
[04:52:03] the
[04:52:05] Void the family needs to provide a
[04:52:08] reasonable explanation it appears the
[04:52:10] good sir has seen many great events
[04:52:13] how's volume that an Uninvited Guest has
[04:52:15] unexpectedly entered the
[04:52:17] Dreamscape however their target is not
[04:52:21] the ordinary guests but the ambassadors
[04:52:23] of the IPC the music's a little loud the
[04:52:26] family ensure that the safety of the
[04:52:28] guests is of the highest importance miss
[04:52:31] Robin I know the blood hound family has
[04:52:34] already sealed off the theme park and
[04:52:37] has control over the situation the
[04:52:39] family try their best to protect their
[04:52:42] reputation but as you can see sir no
[04:52:45] innocent bystanders were affected in
[04:52:47] this incident perhaps the Dreamscape is
[04:52:49] not as perfect as promised but there's
[04:52:52] no place safer than dreams under the
[04:52:53] family's wool yeah I'll turn Robin's
[04:52:56] voice up after let through this stay
[04:52:59] here but keep in mind guests come to

[04:56:43] Robin I didn't expect to meet a fan here
[04:56:47] I'm honored welcome to penacon a world
[04:56:51] filled with wonderful dreams I can't
[04:56:54] believe I'm actually meeting the real

[04:56:59] Festival preparation is important yeah
[04:57:02] you probably wouldn't want a venturine

[04:57:27] like rain and the red light tearing
[04:57:29] through the sky claiming it was merely
[04:57:32] special effects seems a bit farfetched

[04:58:39] Sparkle
[04:58:45] we're Back to Where it All
[04:58:47] Began you entered the golden hour from
[04:58:50] this place
[04:58:51] Firefly and it is also from here where
[04:58:54] you will enter the true okay no spoilers
[04:58:57] please but if Firefly
[04:58:59] dies I'm going to be
[04:59:02] mad it is a pleasure to Journey
[04:59:05] alongside you once
[04:59:08] more but but it's time I laid bare the
[04:59:11] entire truth before
[04:59:15] you as you might have
[04:59:18] heard I also go by another
[04:59:22] name stellon Hunter yeah I saw the drip
[04:59:25] marketing I know I saw the dri marketing
[04:59:27] you lied to me I'm
[04:59:31] sorry I had no other choice I know you
[04:59:34] have many
[04:59:37] questions do you remember when we
[04:59:39] encountered death death in that strange
[04:59:41] dream ske I do I do when I was caught by
[04:59:44] that Meme the meme in that instant
[04:59:47] before it killed
[04:59:49] me I saw the reflection of another
[04:59:51] Dreamscape in its ghastly
[04:59:54] pupils so following the clues in the
[04:59:57] script I came up with some theories
[04:59:59] about the
[05:00:00] meme that's why are the pauses so longed
[05:00:03] silverwolf to
[05:00:05] meditations drawing everyone to the
[05:00:08] dreams Hotel
[05:00:10] okay I intended to call upon death
[05:00:13] before you
[05:00:14] arrived to Solve the Riddle using more
[05:00:17] direct
[05:00:19] means and then invite you to
[05:00:21] join however contrary to my wishes I
[05:00:25] couldn't defy the
[05:00:27] script and I I didn't get a chance to
[05:00:30] explain it to you okay I'm following
[05:00:33] this is how you see now I was impaled by
[05:00:36] the bladed wings of death the heavy
[05:00:40] pressure of concentrated Memoria my
[05:00:43] asthma exploded in my mind as if it was
[05:00:47] actually reality but after the momentary
[05:00:51] numbness
[05:00:53] subsided I found that my body was
[05:00:56] absolutely unscathed I was still
[05:01:00] alive and it was just as I thought I I
[05:01:03] had arrived at a place stly different
[05:01:06] from this beautiful dream beneath the
[05:01:09] Dreamscape of pentacon lies another more
[05:01:12] chaotic more Primal memory Zone its name
[05:01:17] land of the Exiles land of the Exiles
[05:01:20] and so then I returned to the hotel in
[05:01:23] the Dreamscape hoping to tell you of its
[05:01:27] existence yet I I I could not reveal my
[05:01:30] own
[05:01:31] identity so I could only divert your
[05:01:35] party's attention and lure you away from
[05:01:37] the
[05:01:38] battlefield okay after
[05:01:41] all my attempts proved fule gambling it
[05:01:45] wasn't until not long ago when a crimson
[05:01:49] blade of light shattered the high wall
[05:01:52] of the
[05:01:53] dream causing you all to fall far into
[05:01:56] the abysal depths of the
[05:01:58] Dreamscape that I was able to awaken you
[05:02:01] and your companions one by one okay and
[05:02:04] and that's it that is all that's
[05:02:05] happened so
[05:02:07] far I completely understand I know it's
[05:02:11] tough to believe all this without
[05:02:15] reservations I just want to say okay the
[05:02:17] pauses have to be a bug by the way sorry
[05:02:19] I'll shut up close to the final
[05:02:22] answer just one more thing needs to be
[05:02:26] done and then I can prove it to you
[05:02:30] now let's leave this
[05:02:34] place please close your eyes okay take a
[05:02:38] deep breath
[05:02:40] and visualize the Dreamscapes outline in
[05:02:43] your
[05:02:45] heart and
[05:02:47] remember you must not open your eyes
[05:02:50] times [ __ ] sorry I won't
[05:02:53] three
[05:02:55] two
[05:02:57] one don't be afraid can I open the one
[05:03:01] who has come to oh [ __ ]
[05:03:02] sorry has arrived
[05:03:11] who [ __ ] stop stop stop they told me
[05:03:14] close your eye after a piercing Screech
[05:03:15] a thick and ferocious surge of Memoria
[05:03:17] crashes into your chest churning and
[05:03:19] ravaging your Consciousness becomes like
[05:03:21] scrapes sorry scraps of paper caught in
[05:03:23] a Whirlpool breaking apart dissolving
[05:03:26] and dispersing within the turbulent
[05:03:27] muddy
[05:03:29] current innumerate voices resonated
[05:03:32] through the Symphony of Memoria like
[05:03:33] raring Thunder and among them one Echo
[05:03:35] stood out with exceptional Clarity you
[05:03:37] knew it came from the girl beside you
[05:03:39] your heartbeating to the same Rhythm
[05:03:40] peaceful and even more
[05:03:41] peaceful welcome to my until the quiet
[05:03:45] Darkness memories Ripple into existence
[05:03:48] sorry let me rephrase that until in that
[05:03:50] quiet Darkness memories Ripple into
[05:03:53] existence dot dot dot I never knew you

[05:03:59] me wait in a suit
[05:04:10] do you have a driver's license why would
[05:04:12] you ask that I do oh he does that
[05:04:16] is surprising why because this is jaella
[05:04:21] the city of
[05:04:22] sins jaella no it's
[05:04:25] nothing I'm just thinking that you
[05:04:28] haven't slept in 20 system hours yeah I
[05:04:31] didn't either Firefly I was okay though

[05:04:50] over feel free to activate Sam anytime
[05:04:53] you'd
[05:04:54] like there is still some time before
[05:04:57] part of the script
[05:05:00] unfolds let me stay a little longer in
[05:05:02] this
[05:05:03] body along silence andu neither of them
[05:05:06] brought up any topic seemingly
[05:05:07] accustomed to this silence it wasn't
[05:05:09] until much later that a soft sigh once
[05:05:11] again broke the quiet in the car such a
[05:05:13] long
[05:05:16] tunnel didn't feel this long when I set
[05:05:19] off in half a system hour it will lead
[05:05:22] us to
[05:05:23] Kafka and then comes the downfall of the
[05:05:26] jaella
[05:05:28] Brotherhood is that also part of the
[05:05:30] script it's in your script too
[05:05:34] sorry I didn't
[05:05:37] notice their Destiny won't change just
[05:05:39] because of your selective
[05:05:43] ignorance I told you before it's a bad
[05:05:47] habit what about you
[05:05:50] then is this the moment you finally find
[05:05:54] the death you've been looking
[05:05:57] for as always it's a blank
[05:06:00] slate it's not on this
[05:06:03] planet why the sudden

[05:06:29] do hey don't take everything so

[05:06:35] only one type of Destiny Elio Sask the
[05:06:38] inescapable able type he can see the
[05:06:42] future and
[05:06:43] we likewise are aware of our
[05:06:47] predetermined
[05:06:48] end but before that moment arrives we

[05:10:25] anything Elio yeah okay of the
[05:10:30] dreams peny I hope you find whatever you
[05:10:36] seek there be it answers
[05:10:40] more
[05:10:42] salvation okay thanks
[05:10:46] blade so blade if you're not doing
[05:10:50] anything sorry glad to see you're safe
[05:10:53] and
[05:10:55] sound Mr Yang you're here too close your
[05:10:58] eyes wait what just happened hello why'
[05:11:00] she just this is the answer that was a
[05:11:03] sharp turn isn't it
[05:11:06] incredible the monster that we have
[05:11:08] always known as
[05:11:10] death is actually the guardian of the
[05:11:14] land of the
[05:11:16] Exiles it abides by a certain
[05:11:20] Rule abducting people from their dreams
[05:11:22] and bringing them here the question that
[05:11:25] has been perplexing us does death really
[05:11:29] exist in the Dreamscape yes appears to
[05:11:32] be a cognitive trap it was laid by those
[05:11:35] orchestrating events from the Shadows to
[05:11:38] cover up the truth behind the
[05:11:40] disappearances and the existence of this
[05:11:42] Fortress known as dream flux Reef okay
[05:11:46] every emergence of that Meme is related
[05:11:49] to the watchmaker since dreamlux reef is
[05:11:53] where it brings its captives it's likely
[05:11:56] that many of our long-standing questions
[05:11:58] will be answered in this place the
[05:12:01] atmosphere here is Darkly different from
[05:12:04] the beautiful
[05:12:06] dream there are no Regulators here like
[05:12:09] the
[05:12:10] family and they all look like they're
[05:12:12] mildly dazed but from The Whispers of
[05:12:15] the
[05:12:16] residents I've heard a familiar
[05:12:19] Gallagher
[05:12:21] Gallagher it's that man again always in
[05:12:24] the right place at the right
[05:12:26] time though that does save us the
[05:12:29] trouble of looking for
[05:12:30] him heo and March have already made a
[05:12:33] move get ready we're about I should
[05:12:36] probably rewatch The the last scene of
[05:12:38] 2.1 real dream I kind of forgot what
[05:12:40] happened the
[05:12:42] Exiles hey Firefly before we go should
[05:12:46] we speak to everyone
[05:12:48] first I'm really sorry for waiting until
[05:12:52] now to tell you
[05:12:55] everything why can't you reveal your
[05:12:57] true identity well isn't that what you
[05:12:58] just said two
[05:13:01] reasons firstly the
[05:13:04] script in the future that Elio
[05:13:07] saw Sam and and the astral Express's
[05:13:10] confrontation was
[05:13:13] inevitable I that
[05:13:18] aside thank
[05:13:20] you so who's Sam do you still remember
[05:13:24] that medical cabin I told you about
[05:13:28] yeah
[05:13:30] well that's
[05:13:32] Sam it belongs to the iron Cavalry of
[05:13:36] Glam moth's firmament front line
[05:13:39] a firefly typee four tactical heavy
[05:13:43] assault Mech strategical assault Mech
[05:13:45] that's what it stands for cradle of let
[05:13:47] me write that down cuz it's going to be
[05:13:48] in some trivia game show and the meaning
[05:13:51] of my
[05:13:55] birth longest time it
[05:14:00] was what does Sam stand for strategic
[05:14:03] ass Mech differs from correct one point
[05:14:12] cool cool I should probably play a
[05:14:14] character that explores faster wait I
[05:14:17] just what did I just
[05:14:19] do notice I click top left trying to
[05:14:21] skip because of [ __ ]
[05:14:24] waa um what's our exploration team do I
[05:14:26] have one oh lagging
[05:14:29] okay hello hello hello hello hello hello
[05:14:33] hello hello H hello hello hello hello
[05:14:35] hello hello
[05:14:50] uh we'll do
[05:14:54] acaron wait who's the fastest to run
[05:14:57] around with I know you could do yukong
[05:15:00] iner
[05:15:01] Lune you could
[05:15:04] do cely for invis
[05:15:11] Dill no I just do
[05:15:19] D oh yeah Sparkle can
[05:15:22] too okay let me just put a
[05:15:25] Healer all right we got a
[05:15:32] team water heat the cloud
[05:15:35] song
[05:15:37] Oh what I huge cocky what a huge cocky
[05:15:42] also left his mark on dream flux what
[05:15:44] the [ __ ]
[05:15:57] well what's this
[05:16:21] watch
[05:16:29] this
[05:16:32] unbelievable to think there's a
[05:16:33] settlement of this size within the
[05:16:36] Dreamscape and all beyond the family's
[05:16:38] reach
[05:16:42] I'm going to turn this to
[05:16:46] five is this
[05:16:49] louder the atmosphere in this Fortress
[05:16:52] is pretty different from that in the
[05:16:55] beautiful dream when I first saw
[05:16:58] it I was in awe
[05:17:01] too the sky here it's like is that a
[05:17:04] three star a reflection of the 12
[05:17:07] Dreamscapes
[05:17:09] what's even more bizarre is that this
[05:17:11] place is also separated into trade and
[05:17:14] residential
[05:17:15] areas the layout may be simple I don't
[05:17:18] trust Clocky let the record show before
[05:17:21] we do the quest it seems that there are
[05:17:24] quite a number of people living
[05:17:26] here I don't trust Clocky I don't trust
[05:17:29] Misha both Dreamscapes have distinct
[05:17:31] styles theal designs are quite similar
[05:17:34] is it works of the same hand perhaps
[05:17:37] hard not to spec culate on the
[05:17:42] connection but there's no point in
[05:17:45] overthinking things let's meet up with
[05:17:47] himo and the others first take a right
[05:17:50] turn at the end of this road and you'll
[05:17:52] reach the trade thanks Firefly not
[05:17:54] coming with
[05:17:55] us the astral Express likely needs room
[05:17:58] for some internal
[05:18:01] deliberation sure let's reconnect later
[05:18:04] dude what did they do you look look oh
[05:18:06] wait was the right decision further
[05:18:09] observations are need wait Misha's in
[05:18:10] the back with Clocky wait a second but
[05:18:12] first there's something did I just
[05:18:14] summon him into
[05:18:15] existence let's go I'm sure you've
[05:18:18] already noticed
[05:18:20] him who look over there the Ry hotel's
[05:18:24] Bell
[05:18:25] booy how did he end up here and right
[05:18:29] after Miss acaron severed the beautiful
[05:18:32] dream he heard you talking [ __ ] we'd
[05:18:36] better check just to be sure no cuz look
[05:18:39] look look look the only thing that what
[05:18:42] the [ __ ] why is there a kid in the trash
[05:18:43] legal for me to stay in honestly based
[05:18:46] what dude I literally look I got lowkey
[05:18:48] one of the ly con spoils spoils me uh
[05:18:51] which ly cone is it it's probably
[05:18:53] destruction or is it Harmony it might be
[05:18:57] Harmony I think Robin can use it right
[05:19:00] yeah
[05:19:01] Harmony hello this looks like Misha's
[05:19:04] dad is this Michael hello
[05:19:13] also now that I was looking through them
[05:19:15] though in
[05:19:17] destruction no that's just Misha soon
[05:19:20] you'll be able to go to a larger world
[05:19:21] the boy happily accepted his inheritance
[05:19:24] inheritance of course before that time
[05:19:25] comes however guard this place well
[05:19:34] Misha the hands of the compass keep
[05:19:37] turning until they point to the moment
[05:19:39] of Dreams the asdon system overflowing
[05:19:41] with Memorial glows with a soft light
[05:19:42] outside the Train's Windows hey guys
[05:19:45] what do you suppose the world with
[05:19:46] within the dream would look like it I
[05:19:49] must meticulously map it out the
[05:19:51] girl packing away her surveying tools
[05:19:55] gazes at the new world within reach F
[05:19:57] anticipation that place is a mess don't
[05:19:59] you run off don't you run off once we
[05:20:01] get in there I won't have you two
[05:20:02] getting kidnapped
[05:20:04] again the man in the cowboy attire
[05:20:06] grumbles as he cleans his weapon then
[05:20:08] walks over to the sofa with a drink
[05:20:10] shaking his head in resignation the
[05:20:12] landine of the dreams promises infinite
[05:20:14] possibilities will surely make our Mark
[05:20:15] hey conductor if I fall if we fall in
[05:20:18] love with that place and never return
[05:20:19] would you miss us the nameless dresses
[05:20:21] like a gentleman nameless dress like a
[05:20:23] gentleman Winks at pom pom smiling you
[05:20:26] can't joke at the condu conductor's
[05:20:28] expense like this is that what you want
[05:20:30] to say conductor the girl's M stous grin
[05:20:32] spreads across her face you guys are so
[05:20:33] mean the bubbles drift and up and down
[05:20:36] in the glass as the express fills up
[05:20:38] with joyful laughter the youthful
[05:20:40] silhouettes of these nameless get
[05:20:41] gradually slowed slow swallowed by
[05:20:44] Memoria have a safe trip please when the
[05:20:46] conductor turns their head the express
[05:20:47] is already empty the conductor stands
[05:20:50] Frozen this time hauntingly familiar as
[05:20:53] if lived through countless times
[05:20:58] before
[05:20:59] [Music]
[05:21:01] beep wait a
[05:21:03] second what the [ __ ] I just passed my
[05:21:06] bachelor's exams could I I get a

[05:21:42] five you're wait well con
[05:21:48] see nope Clocky is a good friend of mine
[05:21:52] we all live here how did you two get
[05:21:55] here this Dreamscape isn't supposed to
[05:21:58] be open to the
[05:22:00] public I wonder if it has something to
[05:22:03] do with
[05:22:04] sleepy so this is your home yep after my
[05:22:10] work in the beautiful dream ends I'll go
[05:22:12] back home commuting used to be more
[05:22:15] convenient but ever since travel became
[05:22:17] cumbersome sleepy started fing people
[05:22:20] back and forth between the two
[05:22:21] Dreamscapes this
[05:22:24] sleepy can you describe what it looks
[05:22:27] like sleepy is a memory Zone name looks
[05:22:31] Fierce and has many eyes but it's
[05:22:34] actually really well
[05:22:35] behaved taking care of it
[05:22:39] Gallagher again based on the description
[05:22:41] that Meme is indisputably
[05:22:44] death nightmare for the family but for
[05:22:48] the people who live here well that
[05:22:50] couldn't be further from the truth death
[05:22:54] not in a dream surely sleepy is just a
[05:22:57] little aggressive and sometimes messes
[05:22:59] up by fetching the wrong guest but it
[05:23:01] would never hurt anyone I see has it
[05:23:06] brought back any guests recently say in
[05:23:09] the last day or two we're currently
[05:23:12] investigating a missing person case that
[05:23:14] occurred within the beautiful dream I
[05:23:17] see then you'll have to speak with
[05:23:19] Gallagher I'm sure he's very busy he's
[05:23:21] currently busy hosting a visitor from
[05:23:23] the oak family and specifically asked
[05:23:25] not to be
[05:23:26] disturbed um Mr Yang the person you're
[05:23:31] looking for is it Miss
[05:23:33] Robin just as I thought considering what
[05:23:37] happened with Miss Firefly this doesn't
[05:23:39] come as a surprise if you're looking for
[05:23:42] Miss Robin I can lead the way she told
[05:23:45] me that she'd be willing to meet with
[05:23:46] outside guests yo thanks this if it's
[05:23:50] not too much
[05:23:51] trouble also we're looking for our
[05:23:54] missing companions a woman with red hair
[05:23:57] accompanied by wait him's missing you
[05:24:00] seen sorry I forgot 2.1 sorry oh I I
[05:24:04] haven't but please rest assured dream
[05:24:08] flux reef is a small place and it's not
[05:24:11] as bustling as the I saw a tweet that
[05:24:12] was like Koko will be imaginary
[05:24:15] soon how about this since it's your
[05:24:18] first time here in dreamlux Reef I'll be
[05:24:20] your guide and help you find your
[05:24:22] companions and then we can all go visit
[05:24:24] miss Robin together she's gone to Mrs
[05:24:26] Grace's to visit the children she won't
[05:24:29] be there all right then we'll uh follow
[05:24:31] your plan the
[05:24:32] reason 15 this we now know the answer to
[05:24:36] both murdered cases that have caused
[05:24:38] such commotion in pentacon yeah as for
[05:24:40] the intentions of The Mastermind behind
[05:24:43] it all we are still none the
[05:24:46] wiser that name sleepy uh no
[05:24:51] idea but its connection to gager is
[05:24:54] worth digging into regardless we have to
[05:24:58] find
[05:24:59] him say you mentioned before that you
[05:25:03] saw Clocky that it actually only those
[05:25:05] with innocent or pure hearts which is
[05:25:07] why children and me could see them but
[05:25:09] now you can too Mr Yang I can't shake
[05:25:12] off this strange feeling therefore
[05:25:15] you're pure at heart really still so
[05:25:17] young at heart forget it it's not
[05:25:20] important uh we'd better just follow
[05:25:24] Misha
[05:25:27] okay
[05:25:34] stream everyone look from here you can
[05:25:38] see the most spectacular view of
[05:25:41] dreamlux
[05:25:42] reef a black hole that's the abyss
[05:25:45] that's the abyss portal musk Reef disc
[05:25:48] formed from Consolidated
[05:25:50] Memoria was dreamlux Reef built on such
[05:25:53] unstable Memoria oh so Mr Yang is also
[05:25:58] versed in Memoria Dynamics I was just
[05:26:01] trying to figure out how to explain this
[05:26:03] huge hole to everyone I bet you guys
[05:26:06] have a lot in common with Miss Cy
[05:26:11] every time they say Memoria I'm going to
[05:26:13] take a
[05:26:16] shot whoa the Memoria is so
[05:26:23] unstable my calculations are finally
[05:26:26] done in another hours the above dream
[05:26:30] will swallow the dream below my
[05:26:33] hypothesis was correct this place will
[05:26:35] cease to exist as the dream devours
[05:26:37] everything
[05:26:40] H who are you all and why haven't you
[05:26:42] left
[05:26:43] yet who are you I'm KY a Dreamscape
[05:26:46] surveyor specializing in Memoria and
[05:26:48] Dynamics and this life's work that I'm
[05:26:52] researching you see that huge gaping
[05:26:54] hole it was just a narrow Rift many
[05:26:57] years ago but now it's grown into a
[05:26:59] giant hole the surrounding Memoria has
[05:27:02] been flowing towards the other end of
[05:27:04] the hole at a constant velocity slow oh
[05:27:07] again surely
[05:27:09] but the scary part is according to my
[05:27:12] calculations the flow rate of Memoria
[05:27:15] has recently changed and it's faster
[05:27:17] than ever before it's almost almost as
[05:27:21] if something is sucking it in from The
[05:27:22] Other Side by constantly improving upon
[05:27:25] Madam Melina's Memoria measurement
[05:27:28] method I finally obtained accurate
[05:27:30] results after 10 system hours the dream
[05:27:34] flux Reef will cease to exist just like
[05:27:37] the melting of glaciers everything will
[05:27:40] crumble and disintegrate the dreams on
[05:27:43] that side of the Void will fuse into one
[05:27:46] uh please don't worry this sort of thing
[05:27:50] has happened many times before Miss Hy
[05:27:54] isn't a bad person she's just a bit lost
[05:27:58] in her own world you don't
[05:28:02] say there was a something else Rosalina
[05:28:05] Interest Who sorry alinaa oh do you know
[05:28:10] her too or are you also a fan of Memoria
[05:28:14] Dynamics we're very interested in Madame
[05:28:18] Rosalina's achievements uh could you
[05:28:21] tell us a little more about
[05:28:23] them why of course she's an excellent
[05:28:26] scholar of Memoria Dynamics and the
[05:28:29] first person to apply Memoria rate
[05:28:31] measurement methodology on Interstellar
[05:28:34] Travelers regrettably due to the
[05:28:37] presence of the G of recollection
[05:28:39] ordinary people don't pay much attention
[05:28:41] to the nature of Memoria she departed
[05:28:44] this world without much Fame leaving
[05:28:46] only a few thin journals behind I came
[05:28:49] to ponei to learn more about my Idol and
[05:28:52] went to Great Lengths to seek out dream
[05:28:54] flux Reef all because this is her final
[05:28:57] resting place prodigies always meet
[05:28:59] their demise prematurely if only Madame
[05:29:02] roselina had more time she would have
[05:29:04] discovered a way to reverse the flow of
[05:29:06] Memoria
[05:29:08] I felt it the source is in the golden
[05:29:11] hour there is a certain anomalous
[05:29:14] presence stirring the currents of the
[05:29:16] memory Zone I must uncover more concrete
[05:29:19] proof I must convince
[05:29:22] everyone does the name something sound
[05:29:25] familiar to you um yeah of course it was
[05:29:28] one of the nameless uh mentioned by the
[05:29:30] conductor if I remember correctly that's
[05:29:32] right yeah seems like she did a great
[05:29:34] deal of research and calculations in
[05:29:36] dreamlux Reef
[05:29:38] before abruptly passing away oh miss KY
[05:29:43] regularly mentions her I hear Madam
[05:29:46] ralina passed away during the prison
[05:29:49] War she could see the pentacon of
[05:29:52] today should be really happy perhaps our
[05:29:56] destinational district that's where the
[05:29:58] largest crowds Gather in dream where are
[05:30:00] we going oh should I have this unlocked
[05:30:03] already sorry we might be able to find
[05:30:05] the other thing
[05:30:08] is that March hi March where's hoko
[05:30:11] though oh my I'm human and so are you
[05:30:16] can you get a
[05:30:17] grip Mr Yang and Miss Trailblazer I've
[05:30:20] been waiting for you quickly come help I
[05:30:23] bumped into a member of the family on
[05:30:25] the way here he was so scared and I just
[05:30:28] wanted to calm him down but let me go
[05:30:32] let me go I've only done good in my life
[05:30:36] well this is how it turned
[05:30:39] out you shall now you shall pay respect
[05:30:42] to March 7th ghost of dream flux Reef me
[05:30:46] a ghost don't make me hit you oh sorry
[05:30:49] he thinks he's
[05:30:51] dead although when I first fell in I
[05:30:54] also thought the same dear guest this is
[05:30:58] not the afterlife this is dreamlux Reef
[05:31:01] that's right did you hear that repeat
[05:31:04] after me dream
[05:31:08] Reef you you're talking to someone
[05:31:11] invisible if I'm not dead what am I I
[05:31:15] should have pushed my luck and try
[05:31:16] sleeping in my

[05:32:04] bats Destin for Oblivion
[05:32:15] okay he passed out his intense negative
[05:32:19] emotions attracted the nearby memory
[05:32:21] Zone memes I
[05:32:24] see but why aren't the other people
[05:32:26] around here scared unlike in the sweet
[05:32:29] dream people here don't see memory Zone
[05:32:31] memes as dangerous Monsters And even if
[05:32:35] they pose a threat people can easily
[05:32:37] Escape by by forcing a wakeup call but
[05:32:39] we can't just leave this man here wake
[05:32:41] up call like Discord or safe is there a
[05:32:45] peny Discord group chat dude I wonder if
[05:32:48] that group chat gets leaked what do you
[05:32:49] think Sparkle's been saying everyone
[05:32:52] here is living a self-sufficient life I
[05:32:55] don't know how to describe it but this
[05:32:57] place feels like the real
[05:33:00] Dreamscape jeez a stroke of Genius like
[05:33:06] this evening Jesse
[05:33:08] um is it evening welcome Miss March who
[05:33:12] might these be these two are my friends
[05:33:16] as for the man lying on the ground uh

[05:33:22] Fright I see another poor guy who
[05:33:25] accidentally ended up here I'll take
[05:33:27] care of him Sparkle has skeletons there
[05:33:29] been a lot of new faces lately things
[05:33:32] must be tough in this
[05:33:34] dream the few remaining havens of
[05:33:36] freedom and Asana will soon face trouble
[05:33:38] do such things often happen here not
[05:33:41] really but they're becoming more
[05:33:43] frequent now guess it's one of the signs
[05:33:45] of the sweet dreams collapse this man
[05:33:48] has had quite the
[05:33:49] shock could you help me find a halian
[05:33:52] lady March her songs can heal mental
[05:33:54] wounds Chad what do you think the new
[05:33:56] March's name is going to be is it going
[05:33:57] to be is going to be March 8th or or uh
[05:34:01] uh uh uh June
[05:34:02] 7th that must be Robin she's also here
[05:34:06] in dreamlux Reef huh Robin but I thought
[05:34:11] she oh right if March 7th safe and sound
[05:34:17] then it means Robin must be okay too
[05:34:20] Robin's okay about to take us to her to
[05:34:22] find out what happened but before that
[05:34:25] let's meet up with himo you were with
[05:34:27] her earlier right we met some stowaways
[05:34:30] in the residential area most of them
[05:34:32] came from neighboring star systems I
[05:34:35] heard that places like dream flux re
[05:34:37] first scattered throughout the memory
[05:34:39] zone of Asana like islands in the ocean
[05:34:42] they existed before the family arrived I
[05:34:45] also heard that when dream flux Reef
[05:34:47] took shape it was the center of all
[05:34:49] Dreamscapes in pentacon okay if that's
[05:34:52] true it's no wonder there are so many
[05:34:55] similarities between this place and this
[05:34:57] heo must be gathering information let's
[05:35:00] hurry up and get going
[05:35:04] okay who wait who's cloa yo

[05:36:15] know us I've been keeping an eye on you
[05:36:17] since the day you arrived in pentacon
[05:36:20] but we would have met under more dude
[05:36:21] look at his torso it's like width
[05:36:24] between shoulder to shoulder isolated

[05:36:27] Dreamscapes please allow me to formally
[05:36:30] introduce myself I'm Micah the
[05:36:32] gravekeeper of dream FL also without any
[05:36:34] spoiler shot does the quest get like
[05:36:36] better and better or how does it work
[05:36:37] does it like scale up or does it fall
[05:36:39] off late game
[05:36:40] gravekeeper Life in dreamlux reef is
[05:36:43] pretty liberating I feel like everyone
[05:36:45] here mostly keeps to themselves without
[05:36:47] meddling in others Affairs my daily task
[05:36:50] involves cleaning a few quests in most
[05:36:53] games are like so there's usually like
[05:36:57] NPC filler but it's not really filler
[05:36:59] it's like setting the stage right then
[05:37:02] there's something really POG you POG
[05:37:05] right it goes up it's like it starts I
[05:37:07] I'll do a gra to it pogs then it goes
[05:37:09] back down to like some like a bit cooler
[05:37:11] filler than the first one cuz there's
[05:37:12] like cool characters but it's like
[05:37:14] filler and then it goes down a little
[05:37:16] and then and then there's like some big
[05:37:18] cool climax
[05:37:21] climax like like for example it's like
[05:37:23] this and then like it goes up and then
[05:37:26] it goes down a little and then it goes
[05:37:28] up and then it
[05:37:31] like it's not a filler it's like setting
[05:37:34] the stage it's like you need to know the
[05:37:35] information but it's like npc1 oh 20
[05:37:38] years ago the Memoria came all over us
[05:37:42] ah yes the Memoria sorry you're too

[05:40:29] not hash ad anymore it's not often that
[05:40:31] I tried this music style I've gained
[05:40:34] some valuable insights from it
[05:40:37] oh I can't thank you enough Robin well
[05:40:40] these kids have made incredible progress
[05:40:43] in only a few
[05:40:45] days it was nothing Grace I merely
[05:40:48] taught them how to sing it was you who
[05:40:51] brought hope into their lives life must
[05:40:53] be quite difficult for them in reality I
[05:40:56] imagine that's right whenever it's time
[05:40:58] to say goodbye to these kids they're
[05:41:00] reluctant to
[05:41:02] leave but I've explored every corner of
[05:41:05] dream flux Reef talk do we have a robin
[05:41:08] emote chat are there any good
[05:41:12] ones this shatter dream is not worth
[05:41:15] clinging
[05:41:17] to it seems you truly are a child of the
[05:41:21] harmony Emma and Andy are orphans I took
[05:41:24] under my wing Carol there with her blind
[05:41:27] eyes used to work at a nutrition center
[05:41:30] in the outer ring of penacon and as for
[05:41:33] Gary he's been living with autism since
[05:41:36] he was a child autism they're not old
[05:41:38] enough to enter the sweet dream managed
[05:41:41] by the
[05:41:43] family
[05:41:45] Gary see if we compare people to birds
[05:41:50] these kids are like fledglings with
[05:41:52] impaired wings but in this dream well
[05:41:55] they can fly freely even if they stumble
[05:41:59] along the way well they're still relying
[05:42:01] on their own strength that's pretty cool
[05:42:04] me an old lady with no legs well without
[05:42:07] this dream I couldn't even walk toward
[05:42:10] them what the [ __ ] is futa fob
[05:42:13] futa oh F
[05:42:16] okay never mind I'm glad that you found
[05:42:19] a new life here in pen of course most
[05:42:21] normal fob
[05:42:23] chat don't worry Robin dreams have their
[05:42:27] significance but they aren't
[05:42:29] everything both the children and I
[05:42:32] understand this no matter how long we
[05:42:35] fly through this dream we will one day
[05:42:38] return to reality but you know what Emma
[05:42:41] and Gary aren't plagued by their
[05:42:43] insecurities anymore no and Carol is
[05:42:47] learning how to cope with her blindness
[05:42:49] and Andy is livelier than ever cool even
[05:42:53] I've become more optimistic you see in
[05:42:56] dreams we learn how to live once we
[05:42:59] return to reality we learn how to
[05:43:02] survive cool and should our feathers be
[05:43:04] damaged then we share our wings with one
[05:43:07] another there's no need to covet an
[05:43:09] elcer sky in dreams because we have the
[05:43:12] right and the ability to fly towards a
[05:43:15] broader
[05:43:17] Horizon it's a relief to see you safe
[05:43:20] and sound miss
[05:43:22] Robin it's nice to see you all again
[05:43:25] astral Express crew I heard my
[05:43:28] disappearance cause quite the commotion
[05:43:30] out there I'm really sorry about
[05:43:33] that since you're here can we assume
[05:43:37] assume that you're fully aware of the
[05:43:39] situation in penacon ever since I
[05:43:42] returned to
[05:43:43] penone my voice started to change until
[05:43:47] it gradually faded
[05:43:49] away at first I thought it was a
[05:43:51] temporary
[05:43:53] ailment perhaps due to having been way
[05:43:55] too long okay no I thought maybe it just
[05:43:58] take some time for my body to acclimate
[05:44:00] to the high concentration of memori and
[05:44:02] Asana no spoilers but also she said
[05:44:05] Memoria have to take a shot no spoilers
[05:44:08] but every time I play her in my team she
[05:44:09] starts singing so clearly her voice came
[05:44:11] back so at least I know that's happening
[05:44:13] it
[05:44:14] seems the root of the problem goes Way
[05:44:17] Beyond me there are elements around me
[05:44:20] that don't align with the
[05:44:22] harmony I'm losing my voice there just
[05:44:24] one if I finish this water bottle from
[05:44:26] the Memoria I'll get a I'll
[05:44:28] get I'll get I'll get another drink the
[05:44:32] sweet dreams collapse that memo keeper
[05:44:36] mentioned the same thing thing so it's
[05:44:39] real while I was away from penacon the
[05:44:42] boundaries of the 12 Dreamscapes kept
[05:44:44] expanding
[05:44:45] outward but whenever I mentioned the
[05:44:48] anomalies in my dreams all the family
[05:44:50] heads refused to talk about it only my
[05:44:54] brother was willing to
[05:44:56] respond okay later I discovered the
[05:45:00] secret letters from the IPC
[05:45:02] Ambassador internal piss commission
[05:45:04] there are hidden secrets beneath the
[05:45:05] surface of pentacon
[05:45:08] so following the clues in the oak
[05:45:10] family's
[05:45:12] dossier I found my way here the land of
[05:45:15] the
[05:45:16] Exiles concealed by the family under the
[05:45:18] guise of death a Dream Within a dream
[05:45:22] where penton's past is buried hearing
[05:45:25] you speak it sounds as if your voice has
[05:45:27] made somewhat of a recovery true I hate
[05:45:30] to admit it but the Harmony in this
[05:45:33] place resonates more broadly than within
[05:45:35] the Sweet Dream It's
[05:45:37] incredible but the family has
[05:45:39] experienced
[05:45:40] betrayal the traitor or
[05:45:44] traitors abandoned their original
[05:45:46] principles and using the name of
[05:45:49] Harmony exploited people's weaknesses to
[05:45:52] turn pentacon into the planet of
[05:45:54] festivities okay trapping everyone in
[05:45:56] the illusion of the sweet dream this is
[05:45:59] not the strong defending the weak but
[05:46:02] rather the strong exploiting the weak
[05:46:05] okay tell them a world without equality
[05:46:07] won't ever be favored by the
[05:46:09] Harmony and naturally those voices
[05:46:12] blessed by them could there be another
[05:46:14] Force influencing the family's shift in
[05:46:17] philosophy miss Robin considering what
[05:46:19] happened with acaron it's difficult to
[05:46:22] conceive of another entity within the
[05:46:24] realm of the harmony capable of
[05:46:26] influencing
[05:46:28] everyone unless a power surpassing that
[05:46:31] of an emanator is
[05:46:34] involved I'd heard about what happened
[05:46:36] to the yjo
[05:46:38] Alliance but as far as I'm aware the
[05:46:41] family hasn't faced any such external
[05:46:44] interventions okay perhaps I've just
[05:46:47] been away too long been away too long
[05:46:49] and missed something regardless I cannot
[05:46:52] accept my home is moving towards the
[05:46:54] very opposite of what the harmony
[05:46:55] represent then [ __ ] the harmony still
[05:46:57] claiming to uphold it I'm Malian now
[05:46:59] must uncover the reason why Mel cut ties
[05:47:01] with the family M and who exactly it was
[05:47:04] who betrayed us all
[05:47:07] do you remember our Arrangement Mr
[05:47:09] Micah well here's my
[05:47:12] answer I've decided to forgo my role and
[05:47:16] never step foot on the Charmy Festival
[05:47:18] stage
[05:47:23] again 11 of the TR Festival look here
[05:47:27] brother a little bird it's a robin looks
[05:47:31] like a fledgling charm Dove but Charmy
[05:47:35] doves don't live here
[05:47:37] so how did this little bird get here
[05:47:40] maybe its parents abandoned it it looks
[05:47:43] weak and
[05:47:45] frail why don't we find something soft
[05:47:47] and make a nest for
[05:47:49] it this place is too dangerous for a
[05:47:53] fledgling let's take it with us we can
[05:47:55] put it on the wooden shelf in front of
[05:47:57] your
[05:47:59] window okay a bird like that must have a
[05:48:03] beautiful singing voice
[05:48:06] but where will it live I'll ask the
[05:48:10] family head to build a cage for it a
[05:48:13] cage then it won't have the freedom to
[05:48:16] fly
[05:48:19] right let's
[05:48:21] see what is it that has captured the
[05:48:24] attention of the two best interpreters
[05:48:27] of the great one who kind voice to the
[05:48:30] point that they've forgotten how to
[05:48:32] enjoy their
[05:48:35] dessert oh poor little thing uhoh
[05:48:39] doesn't look like it's doing
[05:48:42] well do you want to rescue it I do but I
[05:48:47] don't want to lock it up in a cage why
[05:48:50] uh-oh I don't like this guy even if it's
[05:48:52] small and not fully feathered and can't
[05:48:55] sing I didn't come into this world just
[05:48:58] to be locked up in a cage
[05:49:01] Birds they should be flying free in the
[05:49:04] so hi oh
[05:49:07] sorry that's quite the Romantic idea and
[05:49:11] what about you our young scholar do you
[05:49:15] agree with your sister I think she's
[05:49:18] right I feel like he's going to kill the
[05:49:19] birds leave it out in the wild it won't
[05:49:22] survive for more than a few days at best
[05:49:25] ah I see it seems our little scholar is
[05:49:29] still a bit
[05:49:31] unsure well let me tell you youngsters a
[05:49:35] story
[05:49:37] as you probably know Charmy doves can
[05:49:40] fly through the air when they fly really
[05:49:44] high the friction caused by the flapping
[05:49:47] of their feathers against the atmosphere
[05:49:50] creates amazing lights so that they look
[05:49:54] like shooting stars we've seen this
[05:49:57] spectacle so many times that we think
[05:50:00] it's just something they can naturally
[05:50:03] do but that's not the truth they radiant
[05:50:07] display is the result of countless
[05:50:11] struggles against this doesn't sound
[05:50:13] like a kind voice
[05:50:15] Generations countless struggles against
[05:50:17] nature over Generations their ancestors
[05:50:19] were too weak to survive on the ground
[05:50:22] so to escape Predators they started
[05:50:26] seeking new opportunities in the air
[05:50:29] after countless attempts by many
[05:50:33] generations one of them finally figured
[05:50:36] out how to fly it soared into the sky
[05:50:41] and never looked back at the ground
[05:50:43] again so you mean birds aren't Born to
[05:50:48] Fly feel like this is like a metaphor
[05:50:50] for Robin or some [ __ ] find a way to do
[05:50:52] it through their determination well
[05:50:54] that's an idealistic way of putting it
[05:50:58] so what are your thoughts
[05:51:01] Sunday I I think people believe birds
[05:51:05] are meant to fly because
[05:51:07] they've never seen those birds crashing
[05:51:09] to their death D chill that's an
[05:51:12] interesting
[05:51:14] perspective so have you decided what to
[05:51:17] do with the bird now for now I'll keep
[05:51:21] it in a cage until it can take care of
[05:51:23] itself because I I want it to live no
[05:51:29] matter what well kids it seems each of
[05:51:34] you has found your own an sir we will
[05:51:38] take good care of it won't we brother
[05:51:42] yeah but go for wood wood there's one
[05:51:46] thing I don't that his
[05:51:48] name and what my name who had hoyo HQ
[05:51:51] [ __ ] wrote up go for
[05:51:53] wood what if this little charmony Dove
[05:51:57] never learns to fly in the end I mean if
[05:52:01] there are fledglings in this world that
[05:52:03] can never fly throughout their lives
[05:52:07] should we let them go back to the
[05:52:09] sky only to see them crash to the ground
[05:52:12] and
[05:52:13] die talking in your sleep
[05:52:17] birdie time to wake
[05:52:19] up
[05:52:21] huh oh he's not dead huh need a hand

[05:52:32] that where is Robin tell me now

[05:52:41] ask don't worry your sister is here safe
[05:52:44] and sound
[05:52:46] she's probably walking around the
[05:52:48] streets now if I were you I'd be more
[05:52:51] worried about
[05:52:53] myself after all right in front of you
[05:52:56] is the guy who just stabbed you in the
[05:52:57] chest with a
[05:52:59] dagger if you wanted to kill me you

[05:53:14] wonder you had the guts to go against
[05:53:16] the dream master and the four families
[05:53:19] looks like I made the right choice
[05:53:21] choice you are aware of my plan and see

[05:53:39] famous Robin has chosen my side plus
[05:53:42] some clues about a traitor and a bright
[05:53:44] future for pentacon any of that catch
[05:53:47] your interest I find it hard to believe

[05:54:29] explanation that'd be great please
[05:54:32] follow me honorable Oak family head now
[05:54:36] all the actors are on the
[05:54:40] stage moments
[05:54:43] later well this the monument I mentioned
[05:54:45] earlier the names inscribed on it should
[05:54:49] be familiar to all of you roselina
[05:54:52] and Tian of course when penacon was
[05:54:55] known as a frontier prison it was the
[05:54:57] Trailblazers who connected it with the
[05:54:59] Stars they were the heroes who saved us
[05:55:02] Danna and their names deserve to be
[05:55:04] immortalized not just just on the small
[05:55:07] Stone tablet but in the anals of history
[05:55:09] for all of time however today the planet
[05:55:13] of festivities is nothing but sweet
[05:55:15] dreams that heavy piece of history is
[05:55:18] all a distant
[05:55:20] memory just like that prison if their
[05:55:23] names are inscribed here then that means
[05:55:27] according to Micah they died long
[05:55:30] ago roselina was killed during the war
[05:55:34] of independence she ventured alone Into
[05:55:37] the Heart of the star system to
[05:55:38] investigate the flow of Memoria but she
[05:55:42] never
[05:55:43] returned tyin was a skilled Gunslinger
[05:55:47] strong and reliable he led the people
[05:55:50] through countless battles but he didn't
[05:55:52] live long enough to witness the arrival
[05:55:54] of true peace true piss in the decade
[05:55:58] following the war Pentagon face
[05:56:00] challenges internal and external to
[05:56:03] protect Asana Tian took up the way of
[05:56:06] the trail place and led the L moth
[05:56:08] family to explore beyond the
[05:56:10] system only to be surrounded and wiped
[05:56:14] out by the
[05:56:15] Swarm okay though I had expected as much
[05:56:19] the tales of these Heroes truly are
[05:56:21] sorrowful true to the title of
[05:56:24] Trailblazer they spent their lives
[05:56:26] venturing into the
[05:56:28] unknown but what about this tablet there
[05:56:32] are no names carved on it when dreamlux
[05:56:34] Reef was created its owner was still
[05:56:38] alive however he insisted on erecting a
[05:56:41] monument for himself saying that it will
[05:56:45] happen someday here we meet again Robin
[05:56:49] oh [ __ ] I clicked too fast here we meet
[05:56:51] again
[05:56:52] Robin
[05:56:54] sorry items obain speed
[05:56:58] hams I promised to give the siblings
[05:57:01] some privacy so let's talk about our
[05:57:03] business first what do he say that
[05:57:06] sounds sensible enough since you went
[05:57:09] through the trouble of gathering the
[05:57:10] family head the crew and the stellon
[05:57:13] hunters I'm guessing you have something
[05:57:15] important to say Mr Gallagher oh is it
[05:57:18] that obvious the look on your face is
[05:57:21] practically screaming I'm the one behind
[05:57:23] all yeah tell them
[05:57:26] March you're right Mr Yang it is indeed
[05:57:30] time to come clean on everything the
[05:57:33] siblings already know what they need to
[05:57:36] and they've made their
[05:57:38] choice but you nameless arrived a bit
[05:57:41] late so it's only fair that I answer
[05:57:44] your questions before we begin let me
[05:57:48] reintroduce myself I'm the founder of
[05:57:51] dreamlux reef the deputy of the
[05:57:55] watchmaker and the one who sent out that
[05:57:58] invitation as Gallagher the history
[05:58:02] fictionist I humbly extend my greetings
[05:58:05] to you all
[05:58:06] history
[05:58:08] fictionist so what everything you told
[05:58:11] us was made up well don't worry fiction
[05:58:14] everything I shared was true well except
[05:58:18] for the part about the family accepting
[05:58:20] me back I double checked with my gu so
[05:58:22] he's a yapper and everything he said
[05:58:24] about the family the watchmaker and mich
[05:58:26] is
[05:58:27] true thank you for your a FS crafter now
[05:58:31] let's get down to business I'm sure
[05:58:33] you're all wondering why I went through
[05:58:35] the trouble of setting up this battle
[05:58:36] for the Legacy inviting different
[05:58:39] factions and stirring up a Ruckus all
[05:58:41] over
[05:58:42] pentacon yeah t orbs better than damage
[05:58:44] boils down to something very familiar
[05:58:47] all of you the stellon the
[05:58:50] stellon but how is that possible
[05:58:53] pentacon is a free flowing Interstellar
[05:58:56] Hub there are no signs of contamination
[05:58:59] whatsoever you're totally correct so
[05:59:03] care to take a guess at what that means
[05:59:08] you're pulling on our leg again the
[05:59:10] sweet dream doesn't come out of thin air
[05:59:12] if you think of the memory Zone as the
[05:59:14] sea creating the land of the dreams is
[05:59:17] like filling that wild ocean with Earth
[05:59:20] to make an island oh is gager the one
[05:59:22] telling everyone to go
[05:59:24] 44111 no wonder have to deal with these
[05:59:27] [ __ ] in my chat stop listening
[05:59:28] to Gallagher to achieve this without the
[05:59:32] help of an emanator of remembrance or
[05:59:34] enigmata the only way is to use a
[05:59:38] stellon and that's not something you can
[05:59:40] achieve with a simple wish it requires
[05:59:43] vast quantities of knowledge time and
[05:59:47] Manpower I'm sure you get what I'm
[05:59:49] hinting at in ozana the planet of
[05:59:53] festivities itself is a stellon
[05:59:56] disaster uh the planet of festivities
[06:00:00] itself is a stellon
[06:00:03] disaster what does that mean sorry being
[06:00:05] as o means you need to know the inside
[06:00:07] jokes of like five different games I'm
[06:00:09] sorry liberated theti prison you don't
[06:00:11] have to wor about it countless
[06:00:13] challenges as they began building
[06:00:14] pentacon from the ground up that's when
[06:00:17] the idea of using the stellon came into
[06:00:19] play okay the stellon first entered the
[06:00:23] aana system during the
[06:00:25] war the nameless warned everyone against
[06:00:29] the Folly of attempting to tamper with
[06:00:31] such a power and most heeded their words
[06:00:35] but there are are always people in the
[06:00:37] shadows with ulterior motives the
[06:00:40] Turning Point came after tian's death
[06:00:42] with two of the nameless gone the
[06:00:45] watchmaker had to go to the front lines
[06:00:48] it was at that moment his Rivals saw an
[06:00:50] opportunity by the time a representative
[06:00:53] from the mour systems family arrived at
[06:00:56] the watchmaker's call the stellon had
[06:00:58] already been activated and was seeping
[06:01:01] into the primordial synesthesia
[06:01:03] Dreamscape and I suppose the family
[06:01:06] happened to possess the knowledge to
[06:01:07] seal the stellon not just that they knew
[06:01:11] far more about the stellon than the
[06:01:13] average person they helped Mel swiftly
[06:01:16] quell the civil unrest and played a part
[06:01:19] in building pentacon the disguise of the
[06:01:22] harmony those three eras were known as
[06:01:25] the age of dreaming watchmaker who had
[06:01:29] been left in the dark so there's leakers
[06:01:31] Among Us the
[06:01:33] universe then how how did they turn
[06:01:36] against each other remember the island
[06:01:39] in the ocean metaphor I don't the truth
[06:01:41] is the stellon was never truly sealed it
[06:01:45] existed in a different form within the
[06:01:48] Dreamscape think about this what would
[06:01:50] it cost to create and maintain such a
[06:01:53] lavish
[06:01:55] Dreamland it's people's lives the
[06:01:58] opulent dream is built upon the decay of
[06:02:00] spirits with a toxic Elixir called
[06:02:03] pleasure flowing through the Dreamscape
[06:02:05] it tempts people to indulge in the
[06:02:08] Dreamscape and gradually their minds
[06:02:10] succ come becoming nourishment for the
[06:02:13] sweet dream oh confusion laziness and
[06:02:17] cowardice weaknesses that plague
[06:02:20] Humanity were magnified and nourished by
[06:02:22] the family paniconi became a new kind of
[06:02:25] prison even more impenetrable than the
[06:02:28] previous one I feel like we kind of knew
[06:02:30] this as soon as we saw like 2.0 preview
[06:02:32] stream I was like no way this happy ass
[06:02:34] place is actually happy and and clock's
[06:02:36] a [ __ ] murderer I'm just waiting for
[06:02:37] that part to be true [ __ ] you Clocky
[06:02:39] sorry sadly we realized this far too
[06:02:42] late by then the family had a firm grip
[06:02:45] on pentacon swiftly quelling any
[06:02:48] opposition that arose at my Wit's End I
[06:02:51] had to use the power of the enigmata and
[06:02:54] sought refuge in this chaotic realm over
[06:02:57] the years I created a meme within this
[06:02:59] dream you created a meme dorcy that's
[06:03:03] its real name we exploited a loophole
[06:03:06] you see regular people can't fall asleep
[06:03:08] again while they are inside the
[06:03:10] Dreamscape so this is the true meaning
[06:03:13] of the
[06:03:14] impossible you sent out invitations in
[06:03:17] the watchmaker's name to find forces
[06:03:20] capable of resolving the stellon
[06:03:22] disaster and draw them into pentacon to
[06:03:26] uncover the truth why did someone at Z
[06:03:29] the thing that killed Firefly like I
[06:03:31] don't know what a meme is [ __ ] I
[06:03:33] know what the meme is sorry it's not
[06:03:35] just that above all I wanted to see what
[06:03:38] happens when the major factions engage
[06:03:40] in a struggle for the Legacy since this
[06:03:43] is the watchmaker's first announcement
[06:03:44] in decades the trait tra within the
[06:03:47] family is bound to reveal themselves so
[06:03:50] would you say there's an imposter Among
[06:03:52] Us so the legacy is just a
[06:03:55] facade if you want to consider the
[06:03:57] stellon as the Legacy I'm totally fine
[06:04:00] with that if that's the case where is
[06:04:03] the stellon now that's a question
[06:04:05] question for Mr Wings the stellon is
[06:04:08] still under the family's control and as
[06:04:10] the head of the oak family I'm sure he
[06:04:12] holds all the
[06:04:14] answers so telling me this guy's full
[06:04:16] legal name is Sunday Oak what a [ __ ]
[06:04:20] name are you done talking so will you
[06:04:24] tell us where the stellon
[06:04:26] is okay
[06:04:28] it is the pentacon Grand Theater
[06:04:32] itself huh as I suspected
[06:04:36] it's the embodiment of the family the
[06:04:39] edifice that first materialized within
[06:04:41] the sweet
[06:04:42] dream that's what turned penacon into
[06:04:44] its current state as for the person who
[06:04:47] employed its power it is in fact Mr
[06:04:50] gopherwood the current dream master okay
[06:04:53] go for what is the worst name well that
[06:04:55] was easier than I thought did you
[06:04:58] conduct your own investigation already
[06:05:03] correct when I was trying to track down
[06:05:05] the person who murdered my sister apart
[06:05:09] from you gopherwood was my second
[06:05:14] suspect confronting me first turned out
[06:05:16] to be a smart move on your part I didn't
[06:05:19] have other options the dream master has
[06:05:22] been Elusive and even the heads of the
[06:05:24] families can hardly get an audience with
[06:05:26] him
[06:05:27] moreover Mr gopher wood has been kind to
[06:05:31] my sister and
[06:05:32] me and I didn't want it all to end like
[06:05:35] this what do you mean by that to be
[06:05:38] honest my brother and I are a he looks
[06:05:41] like a vtuber a lot a lot of characters
[06:05:43] do we grew up as orphans and were
[06:05:46] adopted by the family when they came to
[06:05:49] help Mr goer wood recognized our
[06:05:52] potential and brought us to penacon but
[06:05:54] I can't just stand by and watch Mr
[06:05:57] gopherwood become an enemy of the
[06:05:59] harmony I won't use my voice to support
[06:06:02] an evil cause I won't step on that stage
[06:06:05] and sing
[06:06:06] no matter who the traitor is I see a
[06:06:07] chest or what orders they give me I
[06:06:10] won't let the Charmy Festival become an
[06:06:12] event that destroys Harmony itself okay
[06:06:14] I do see that Su Paradise in our dreams
[06:06:18] indeed for the Paradise in our
[06:06:21] dreams as the head of the oak family I'm
[06:06:25] responsible for ensuring penton's
[06:06:27] promising
[06:06:28] future Robin and I will head into the
[06:06:31] sweet dream and confront the dream
[06:06:33] master and if it turns turns out that
[06:06:36] the family has truly strayed from the
[06:06:38] harmony I'll fight alongside you the
[06:06:41] enemies you were about to face aren't
[06:06:43] like this old dog here who can barely
[06:06:45] even bark since our interests are
[06:06:48] aligned why don't we team up
[06:06:51] may we have always been following in the
[06:06:54] footsteps of our nameless predecessors
[06:06:56] yeah there's no reason to stop now yeah
[06:06:59] we nameless won't back down from a
[06:07:01] challenge isn't that right Miss
[06:07:03] Trailblazer
[06:07:06] uh ain't nothing to fear no more we'd
[06:07:09] win
[06:07:11] what Heroes Never Back Down peace was
[06:07:13] never not what going against the dream
[06:07:16] or not what the [ __ ] is this
[06:07:23] dialogue whenever I rate the quest at
[06:07:26] the end of this this is minus one point
[06:07:28] right
[06:07:33] here come on don't jokes at such a
[06:07:36] serious moment rest assured sitting on

[06:08:50] Yang how powerful is that dream master

[06:08:56] pentacon and he has the entire power of
[06:08:58] the harmony behind him not to mention
[06:09:01] the stellon in his possession we must
[06:09:04] proceed with great caution maybe you can
[06:09:07] just stay behind this time Mr Yang no

[06:09:53] if I'm right he intends to use it to
[06:09:56] track your location or contact you when
[06:09:58] needed as it so happens this may
[06:10:01] actually be of some use in the current
[06:10:03] situation adventuring
[06:10:06] is he still alive yeah he's fine and
[06:10:08] what does he have to do with our mission
[06:10:10] to confront the dream master B remember
[06:10:12] what I said or maybe I'll bust working
[06:10:14] with the IPC is a way to keep the family
[06:10:17] in check if negotiations go south and
[06:10:20] the family show their true colors by
[06:10:23] going after the stellon I'll use this
[06:10:25] transmitter to send a message to the IPC
[06:10:28] the only question mark in all of this is
[06:10:31] aventurine current
[06:10:33] status but the IPC is is always
[06:10:36] listening the message should be a
[06:10:37] problem okay well you take care too if
[06:10:42] anything goes wrong don't worry about me
[06:10:45] just spoken like a true hero even if the
[06:10:49] dream master is innocent the family's
[06:10:51] corruption runs
[06:10:54] deep I won't make the same mistake male
[06:10:58] did let's wish him the best of luck can
[06:11:00] you eat something no you have something
[06:11:03] else to tell us Gallagher what why would

[06:12:42] earlier as for the last nameless he
[06:12:45] embarked disembarked and embarked again
[06:12:49] traveling in a great circle ending up
[06:12:52] back where he started on his deathbed he
[06:12:55] told me to find the astral Express and
[06:12:57] deliver an invitation to the Future
[06:13:00] nameless he left behind a special gift a
[06:13:03] True Legacy come with me now uhoh is the
[06:13:08] time to reveal it what did he leave
[06:13:10] uh-oh is it a l
[06:13:16] cone back here

[06:13:21] alive old friend like you've still got
[06:13:24] so much to say and do I've kept my
[06:13:27] promise brought the future Trailblazers
[06:13:29] you've waited so long
[06:13:31] for I don't know why you were so
[06:13:33] obsessed with that train
[06:13:36] but I remember your last
[06:13:40] words don't let us down old
[06:13:45] man the
[06:13:50] [ __ ] hello what's
[06:13:54] happening let me lock in
[06:14:16] should probably mute alerts said's dead
[06:14:19] go ahead his resting place lies in the
[06:14:23] garden up ahead the first and last male
[06:14:26] Char legor the watchmaker Mel chart leg
[06:14:30] work the L of the watchmaker okay
[06:14:43] kind of don't want to use my technique
[06:14:45] is there anything over here fine what he
[06:14:46] the cloud
[06:14:50] song What A heat the cloud saw oh
[06:15:01] chest another chest
[06:15:10] wait is that a
[06:15:13] wheelchair wait that's the [ __ ] uh
[06:15:15] Relic set that's the break effect
[06:15:27] set Beneath the Sea surface of the
[06:15:30] memory Zone in a garden
[06:15:32] closest to the full moon in the water an
[06:15:35] elderly man rests on a recliner
[06:15:36] enveloped in utter silence the
[06:15:39] watchmaker Mel leg work has passed that
[06:15:41] endless Timeless dream where no sound
[06:15:42] could ever awaken him sure enough the
[06:15:45] watch maker is the third nameless even I
[06:15:48] could guess that
[06:15:49] one the Legacy he left behind was a
[06:15:52] dream bubble I believe inside that
[06:15:55] bubble there's something that holds
[06:15:57] meaning only for the nameless after all
[06:16:00] when I checked its contents I found
[06:16:02] nothing
[06:16:03] inside Maybe some trailblaze
[06:16:07] runes even more mysterious than me well
[06:16:11] let's have a
[06:16:12] look as the words cease himo nods ever
[06:16:15] so slightly in your direction you take a
[06:16:16] deep breath steady your mind and turn
[06:16:17] your gaze towards the watch maker touch
[06:16:20] the dream
[06:16:22] bubble first round against the dream
[06:16:24] bubbl and the thick vicious
[06:16:27] Memoria converges under strain then
[06:16:30] stretches outward from your fingertips
[06:16:32] as if weaving a delicate web it gently
[06:16:34] cradles your Palm a chill travels from
[06:16:36] your fingertips carrying it with a
[06:16:38] carrying with it a myriad of vibrant and
[06:16:40] intertwined memories as experience would
[06:16:42] suggest but in time but this time you
[06:16:44] see nothing at all how could this be try
[06:16:47] to focus and capture
[06:16:49] Memories the dream bubble is clearly
[06:16:50] extraordinary perhaps the approach was
[06:16:52] wrong you think holding your breath and
[06:16:54] closing your eyes with one knee on the
[06:16:55] ground you press your forehead against
[06:16:57] the thin film coated in
[06:17:00] memoral then before you there remains an
[06:17:02] abyss of darkness no Crimson Sun
[06:17:04] descending upon the snowcapped mountains
[06:17:06] no gentle laughter no twinkle stars
[06:17:09] twinkling stars no Echoes of Swords
[06:17:11] clashing and most of all no traces of
[06:17:13] trailblaze there's nothing and nothing
[06:17:15] is there
[06:17:16] indubitably this is but an empty dream
[06:17:18] bubble wait what's going on
[06:17:22] [Music]
[06:17:23] seriously there's nothing inside this
[06:17:26] dream
[06:17:29] bubble How could a dream bubble be
[06:17:33] empty just just as I suspected that old
[06:17:36] man always had this strange belief in
[06:17:38] the nameless and the trailblaze and I
[06:17:41] never understood where he got that
[06:17:43] confidence from Echoes especially since
[06:17:45] he never managed to get in touch with
[06:17:47] the express while he was alive could
[06:17:49] never figure out what was going on in
[06:17:51] that old man's head but this empty dream
[06:17:55] bubble is so typical of him he was
[06:17:58] always full of weird fantasies and
[06:18:01] incomprehensible romanticism
[06:18:05] that mischievous old
[06:18:08] man don't think that's the case
[06:18:10] Gallagher there's a bird I'm sure male
[06:18:13] has left us the most precious thing of
[06:18:15] all whatever you say gorgeous don't
[06:18:17] start getting all philosophical on me
[06:18:19] all right just as male believes in the
[06:18:22] nameless of the future we
[06:18:24] unconditionally believe in the nameless
[06:18:26] of the past how could they leave with
[06:18:29] regrets for the future when they were
[06:18:31] ready to dedicate their lives to the
[06:18:33] land they loved their there must be
[06:18:35] something contained in this dream bubble
[06:18:38] it's just we haven't figured it out
[06:18:40] yet you also have faith in the watch
[06:18:43] maker don't you Gallagher well I'm a
[06:18:47] follower of the
[06:18:48] enigmata My Philosophy forbids me to
[06:18:51] have faith in anything that's why I
[06:18:55] understand what faith means in the path
[06:18:58] of Trail
[06:19:00] BL and I also want to know what he left
[06:19:04] behind
[06:19:05] H can I borrow your pet I need to make a
[06:19:09] trip back to Golden hour and check
[06:19:10] something at the Dreamscape sales store

[06:22:28] express earlier but they didn't
[06:22:31] respond something doesn't seem right
[06:22:35] I need to leave for a moment you can

[06:23:12] unsettling thing sorry sorry possibly go
[06:23:16] wrong it better not relax with a big
[06:23:19] event like this there's bound to be lots
[06:23:22] of gossip and rumors don't
[06:23:25] worry oh that's a relief well looks like
[06:23:30] I won't get any fudging clues out of
[06:23:32] these two that was useless
[06:23:40] Cody greetings I'm Cody of the blood
[06:23:43] hound family head of security for the
[06:23:45] hotel hello so uh there's something I
[06:23:49] wanted to ask about I've been hearing
[06:23:52] some unsettling rumors about certain
[06:23:55] incidents that might affect the charmony
[06:23:57] festival do I care about this think
[06:23:59] there's anything to be worried about I
[06:24:02] um what do you mean
[06:24:05] wait you haven't heard yes okay sorry
[06:24:08] I'm not sure where you heard those
[06:24:11] rumors but they're completely baseless I
[06:24:15] can assure you as a representative of
[06:24:17] the blood hound family that everything
[06:24:19] is going smoothly for the charm
[06:24:22] festival at present all of the families
[06:24:24] are focused on making sure the festival
[06:24:26] starts on time even the dream master
[06:24:29] himself has arrived so don't worry your
[06:24:31] trip won't be in vain ah
[06:24:36] that's a relief she doesn't appear to be
[06:24:40] acting so it seems that even the hotel
[06:24:43] staff are out of the
[06:24:48] loop back already hasn't she returned
[06:24:51] yet
[06:24:53] nope I'm starting to wonder sending her
[06:24:57] to contact Sunday was a good idea
[06:24:59] neither the staff nor the guests seem to
[06:25:02] know anything about what's happening in
[06:25:04] the dream dreamscaping I
[06:25:06] agree another unusual thing is that the
[06:25:09] oak family is supposed to be in charge
[06:25:11] of organizing the council and managing
[06:25:13] everything inside and outside the dream
[06:25:16] I walked around the hotel but didn't
[06:25:18] meet a single member of the oak family
[06:25:21] okay so no one can stop us if we just
[06:25:22] [ __ ] shoot everyone sorry like just
[06:25:24] like walk forward you have to fight just
[06:25:26] go the head of the O family is that
[06:25:29] Sunday guy
[06:25:31] right we shouldn't linger here too long
[06:25:35] let's go back to the express for now not
[06:25:37] so fast have you ever robbed
[06:25:42] vipc bro what if you run away now
[06:25:46] everyone will be chasing after
[06:25:48] you are you this gu a taxor we sit here
[06:25:51] and do nothing I wouldn't say do nothing
[06:25:56] but let's stay put for now even if the
[06:25:59] family has ulterior motives they could
[06:26:02] have anticipated us you don't want to
[06:26:03] attract un wanted attention from certain
[06:26:06] Outsiders so they won't do anything
[06:26:10] Reckless see the IPC lackeys are keeping
[06:26:14] a close eye on this hotel if I were a
[06:26:17] family member I'd find an official
[06:26:19] excuse and keep the surprise factors
[06:26:22] here of course we don't need to walk
[06:26:25] into their trap I gave a backup plan to
[06:26:28] the memo keeper if it turns out we won't
[06:26:31] be allowed to enter the Dreamscape
[06:26:33] she'll order a drink for me in the VIP
[06:26:36] lounge at the hotel in reality a secret
[06:26:40] signal that's right oh a concrete object
[06:26:43] can indeed help the memo keeper
[06:26:45] establish a connection with
[06:26:47] you but bu Hill if you have more backup
[06:26:51] plans in the future I hope you'll let me
[06:26:54] know in
[06:26:56] advance I'm sorry but it's one of my
[06:27:00] quirks I have too many unreliable
[06:27:03] friends and if I reveal that I have
[06:27:05] backup plans things can
[06:27:11] things how do we get into the VIP
[06:27:16] lounge [ __ ] I can't check my builds this

[06:32:20] enjoy hey this guy doesn't know anything
[06:32:23] at all as long as you're
[06:32:26] satisfied let's give the memo keeper
[06:32:28] another half system hour if she doesn't
[06:32:32] show up we'll need to come up with a new
[06:32:34] plan the situation is
[06:32:36] unclear something must have happened on
[06:32:38] the planet of festivities but the public
[06:32:41] is unaware of it someone in a position
[06:32:44] of power within the family must be
[06:32:45] covering it up it's unusual for the
[06:32:48] followers of the harmony to invite other
[06:32:50] factions let alone the IPC and the
[06:32:53] masked
[06:32:56] fools if what you said about the
[06:32:58] emanator of the nihility is true the
[06:33:01] situation in penacon is a little
[06:33:05] complicated to say the
[06:33:07] least actually you here G see in a month
[06:33:11] I feel like we're almost we're like
[06:33:12] almost done as you know the faction that
[06:33:16] follows the path of the Hunt is some of
[06:33:18] the most dangerous bulks in the cosmos
[06:33:20] to mess with I mean we're about to get
[06:33:24] the boss fight right would impersonate
[06:33:26] the sieno alliance or the Galaxy
[06:33:29] Rangers it's like ask him for a death
[06:33:32] Wish isn't there a same among the sieno
[06:33:34] people that the rainbow set lets their
[06:33:38] Lux Arrow do all the beaten talking do
[06:33:43] all the Talking well talking you know
[06:33:46] what I
[06:33:47] mean even though the Galaxy Rangers have
[06:33:50] been out of sight for years we've been
[06:33:53] keeping an eye on this region even the
[06:33:55] dumbest criminals know better than the
[06:33:57] mess with the annihilation gain much
[06:34:00] less the Rangers but that Aur okay
[06:34:02] someone CH just wrote I have she doesn't
[06:34:04] seem like a lunatic at all on the contr
[06:34:08] she's smart so we have 6 to seven hours
[06:34:10] left [ __ ] that's how long you
[06:34:12] said the whole Quest is what are you
[06:34:14] talking about the when to strike without
[06:34:16] mercy and do you believe that someone
[06:34:19] like her would have an ulterior motive
[06:34:21] for impersonating a galaxy ranger I'm
[06:34:24] not entirely sure but I do have my
[06:34:28] suspicions maybe she knows a galaxy
[06:34:31] ranger or perhaps she's trying to lure
[06:34:34] us out for some reason anyway what
[06:34:37] worries me more are the anomalies within
[06:34:39] the family they've summoned followers
[06:34:42] from various paths for the festival no
[06:34:45] matter how generous such a gesture is
[06:34:47] this move seems highly unusual unless
[06:34:51] the invitations weren't sent by
[06:34:54] them if that's the case it's even more
[06:34:57] intriguing that the family insists on
[06:34:59] organizing the charmon festival maybe
[06:35:02] it's she pay the a Harmony pulling the
[06:35:05] strings you find it Beyond human
[06:35:07] understanding because it wasn't deranged
[06:35:09] by humans at all people do stupid
[06:35:13] things
[06:35:15] impulses they abandon their principles
[06:35:17] when self-interest is involved they
[06:35:20] believe in things they know they
[06:35:22] shouldn't and fge they even break their
[06:35:25] own rules but
[06:35:27] eons don't they stick to their
[06:35:31] determined path and never turn back you
[06:35:34] think sheep's will is behind all
[06:35:37] this it may not necessarily be
[06:35:41] sheipe there's definitely some higher
[06:35:43] entity
[06:35:44] involved I know sound
[06:35:48] pessimistic but if human Free Will were
[06:35:51] reliable why would we even need Galaxy
[06:35:56] Rangers it's much simpler when you boil
[06:35:59] it down to the eons and paths like how
[06:36:02] lawn always follows the path of the hunt
[06:36:05] or or how the express stays true to the
[06:36:07] trailblaze despite hail's disappearance
[06:36:10] but in my opinion akil's fall holds
[06:36:14] significance for the nameless oh so
[06:36:17] you're saying the nameless now have to
[06:36:19] take responsibility for their own
[06:36:20] choices because they're absolutely right
[06:36:24] lead
[06:36:25] exactly I believe the purpose of the
[06:36:27] journey isn't just about following a
[06:36:29] path that's always considered absolutely
[06:36:32] right it's more about
[06:36:34] doing your best to choose the right path
[06:36:36] for yourself among countless
[06:36:38] possibilities okay even with limited
[06:36:41] insight and judgment okay I don't know
[06:36:43] what you've been through but I agree
[06:36:46] that people must take responsibility for
[06:36:48] their
[06:36:49] choices because no one else can do it
[06:36:52] for
[06:36:53] him that's why the Galaxy Rangers need
[06:36:55] to uncover she P for my drink figure out
[06:36:59] her true
[06:37:01] intentions just in case
[06:37:04] I have a backup plan if the memo keeper
[06:37:06] doesn't show up you sure have a lot of
[06:37:08] cards up your sleeve he doesn't have
[06:37:10] sleeves well I guess he does but they're
[06:37:11] like going back to my old career would
[06:37:14] by the way when you were walking around
[06:37:16] the hotel did you happen to see any
[06:37:20] important looking guests what's your
[06:37:23] plan it's simple we just grab some
[06:37:27] hostages and use them as bargaining
[06:37:28] chips the family or maybe we can even
[06:37:31] take their identities no need for that
[06:37:35] we'll return to the express now wa are

[06:40:27] request due to certain reasons I have
[06:40:31] been exiled by the family
[06:40:33] thankfully this memoe keeper came to my
[06:40:35] Aid and helped me escape their
[06:40:37] surveillance
[06:40:39] unnoticed to be honest it was more like
[06:40:43] stalking than
[06:40:45] helping and the process was far from
[06:40:49] unnoticed but we did
[06:40:52] Escape I asked her to guide me to a
[06:40:54] place beyond the family's reach and to
[06:40:56] contact a few trustworthy individuals
[06:40:59] namely all of you trustworthy
[06:41:04] the son of a nice lady you think I'm
[06:41:07] dumb or
[06:41:08] something how about this I'll put a few
[06:41:12] B holes in your head and see what

[06:41:23] I'm willing to answer all your questions
[06:41:25] but not right now if my cover hadn't
[06:41:28] been blown we might have had more time
[06:41:29] but at the moment we don't have any
[06:41:31] other options
[06:41:33] no other options Put the gun
[06:41:38] down this is the only way I can ensure
[06:41:40] everyone's
[06:41:42] safety I kindly request an immediate
[06:41:45] warp jump out of the astonis star
[06:41:51] system this passenger is
[06:41:55] requesting as far as I can tell she's
[06:41:59] not a threat and seems to be telling the
[06:42:02] truth

[06:42:06] your
[06:42:07] companions Don hung please rest assured
[06:42:10] your nameless companions are safe but
[06:42:12] they need our
[06:42:14] help as for booill you may have guessed
[06:42:19] I've been waiting for
[06:42:20] you Galaxy Rangers are known for their
[06:42:23] elusive nature and limited contact with
[06:42:26] so this was the only way I could reach
[06:42:28] my left arm is getting
[06:42:31] numb only by doing this can I find a
[06:42:34] true how long is this cut scene and
[06:42:37] fulfill a long put your gun down
[06:42:40] man to return his relics to their
[06:42:43] rightful
[06:42:45] owner someone once told
[06:42:48] me that every rainfall is like a gift
[06:42:51] from the heavens a sign of their mercy
[06:42:55] upon the
[06:42:56] world raindrops are said to be the tears
[06:42:58] of the Gods shed in response to the
[06:43:01] Sorrows of the world
[06:43:04] their constant pouring as a reminder
[06:43:06] that the gods haven't abandoned us yet
[06:43:08] okay
[06:43:11] so how long has this rain going on
[06:43:16] for I used to believe just like
[06:43:20] you that it would eventually
[06:43:25] stop years and decades
[06:43:31] passed and in the
[06:43:35] end such
[06:43:37] hope faded away before the rain did
[06:43:42] looks like the god you mentioned doesn't
[06:43:44] exist after
[06:43:46] all as he spoke the old mind's Gaz
[06:43:49] reminded fixed on the remain fixed on
[06:43:51] the distance admits the fine drizzle of
[06:43:53] Black Rain countless shadowy hands
[06:43:54] emerged from the sea shrouded in
[06:43:56] ethereal Mist reaching Towards the Sky
[06:43:59] one by one
[06:44:03] let me share a story with you Mortals
[06:44:09] who walk the
[06:44:10] paths are like Sailors on a vast
[06:44:14] ocean leaving behind a trail that
[06:44:19] creates countless ripples of
[06:44:23] possibilities these ripples last longer
[06:44:27] than the fleeting lifetimes of
[06:44:31] humans and and for
[06:44:34] some their presence leaves such a strong
[06:44:40] Mark that it's reflected in the
[06:44:44] waves like those Shadows on the ocean
[06:44:49] sin
[06:44:50] thers the obsessions of the path
[06:44:54] Striders they emerge from the depths of
[06:44:58] I
[06:44:59] ex seeing themselves as masters of the
[06:45:03] their own
[06:45:04] destiny unknowingly repeating the
[06:45:07] actions of their past lives they emerge
[06:45:12] from the nihility and head toward it
[06:45:16] leading purposeless
[06:45:20] lives
[06:45:22] however these Hollow Phantoms they were
[06:45:26] once my dear
[06:45:29] companions a group of Galaxy
[06:45:34] Rangers are you watching over them
[06:45:36] watching over them
[06:45:39] no I'm guiding them toward
[06:45:43] Transcendence it was a brutal
[06:45:47] War The Crusade That Shook the
[06:45:53] universe the universe witnessed the fall
[06:45:56] of zuro the Lord I remember I was there
[06:46:00] it came at a price
[06:46:04] a price so Hefty that only
[06:46:09] those who were
[06:46:11] there still remember remember the
[06:46:15] unwavering determination of the hunt
[06:46:18] followers persists even in
[06:46:22] death so someone must guide these lost
[06:46:26] souls to their life
[06:46:29] beyond they were heroes in their time
[06:46:34] and they shouldn't be reduced to Mere
[06:46:38] puppets of nihility as for
[06:46:43] me I've suffered too many losses on that
[06:46:47] Battlefield to advance any
[06:46:52] further and that makes me the
[06:46:55] most fitting person to carry out this
[06:46:59] task but you know these sin thirsts
[06:47:04] they're not who they used to be does
[06:47:06] this seem pointless to you though some
[06:47:10] tasks have to be done even if they are
[06:47:14] pointless whoa I can help you for what
[06:47:19] for the meaning of the
[06:47:22] nihility that's what I've been seeking I
[06:47:27] see after all this realm is off limits
[06:47:30] to ordinary Souls right thank you
[06:47:34] stranger before we part ways I have one
[06:47:36] more question what is T it is true that
[06:47:40] actions and even their entire lives may
[06:47:43] seem pointless from our perspective but
[06:47:47] if and it's just an
[06:47:49] if if this is what the Departed ones
[06:47:53] expected I wait for the Departed should
[06:47:56] we try to change it a good
[06:47:58] question and a profound one what I do
[06:48:01] know holy yeah
[06:48:03] is that one
[06:48:05] day I too will pass
[06:48:09] away and when I bid farewell to this
[06:48:12] world someone will stand at my
[06:48:16] grave and place a bouquet of flowers on
[06:48:23] it
[06:48:28] what nine hours when I appeared as a
[06:48:32] child my speech mindset and soul

[06:52:36] power uh-oh what makes you think you can
[06:52:39] sit there all high and mighty looking
[06:52:41] down on everyone else well I've spent
[06:52:45] enough time in confession today to enter
[06:52:47] the Harmony's Paradise right then I'll
[06:52:50] take my leave good luck with your
[06:52:52] election and
[06:52:55] uh that we kind of cooked them oh rever
[06:52:59] triplef faac Soul he my doubts who can
[06:53:04] judge the strong when their power hides
[06:53:07] their
[06:53:08] crimes who can vouch for the weak when
[06:53:12] they will pay any price to survive okay
[06:53:15] who can Comfort the purest Souls when
[06:53:19] even they get LED astray if the strong
[06:53:22] defending the weak is truly the
[06:53:25] foundation of
[06:53:27] paradise then
[06:53:30] who who is responsible I for the
[06:53:33] suffering and anguish in this wretched
[06:53:39] world no
[06:53:42] brother
[06:53:44] brother brother are you all right
[06:53:48] I'm
[06:53:50] fine I've been working long hours and I
[06:53:53] just made a trip to dreamlux reef and
[06:53:56] back so I'm a bit out of
[06:53:59] sorts but it'll all be over before we
[06:54:01] know it you've been working non-stop on
[06:54:03] the Charmy Festival Mr Sunday and no one
[06:54:07] could have predicted this incident even
[06:54:09] if the stellon does I'm trying to get
[06:54:12] through this though still feel sorry for
[06:54:14] all the trouble he' caused
[06:54:16] you no need to worry about troubling
[06:54:19] anyone the charmony festival was meant
[06:54:21] to spread joy and Harmony across the
[06:54:24] cosmos but now that we know the truth
[06:54:28] pause I can't pause it's it's online man
[06:54:31] I can't pause the game been hour I can I
[06:54:33] can I could just click this but we're
[06:54:35] going to get through the cut scene first
[06:54:36] we'll do our best to explain everything
[06:54:38] to the dream master even if the
[06:54:40] negotiation does not go
[06:54:43] smoothly I'll refuse to go on
[06:54:46] stage without the chord Master the
[06:54:48] harmonious choir would not arrive and
[06:54:51] the Charmy Festival would be just a
[06:54:53] grand performance and nothing
[06:54:55] more I'm relieved to see your
[06:54:58] determination you know since arriving in
[06:55:01] pentacon we haven't had any contact with
[06:55:04] this dream master himself I'd heard of
[06:55:07] the heads of the five major lineages but
[06:55:10] the dream master is a mystery to me the
[06:55:12] dream master rarely grants an audience
[06:55:15] even for us okay dream master but given
[06:55:18] the urgency of the situation he's agreed
[06:55:22] to meet us in
[06:55:23] person perhaps he'll be the first guest
[06:55:26] to meet the dream master in years Mr y
[06:55:28] let's hope we can reach a consensus that
[06:55:31] satisfies everyone
[06:55:33] indeed let us hope so okay it's about
[06:55:37] time we'll have to get ready for the
[06:55:39] meeting don't worry okay I can get my

[06:59:29] Moon so it's like a million calories it
[06:59:31] was pretty good
[06:59:32] it's no big deal this theater here looks
[06:59:36] much better than the moon back home it's
[06:59:39] just
[06:59:40] [Music]
[06:59:42] magnificent they told me not to sell
[06:59:45] everything I had just to come to
[06:59:48] pentacon how short s selling everything
[06:59:52] you
[06:59:53] had why would you go to such
[06:59:56] lengths why can't you see life back home
[07:00:02] is
[07:00:03] miserable it's not really living at
[07:00:07] all it's better to be here at pinicon no
[07:00:11] pain no worries about tomorrow just s
[07:00:14] why is this like six-year-old drunk do
[07:00:16] whatever you want that's what I call
[07:00:20] living yeah now this is the
[07:00:25] life is this oh it's a pepp sh my
[07:00:30] bad huh what did you say young lady I
[07:00:35] didn't quite catch
[07:00:38] that oh it's nothing sir you see the
[07:00:42] traffic on Glocks Avenue can be
[07:00:44] dangerous how about I ask a blood hound
[07:00:47] family member to escort you to iDine
[07:00:49] park over there imagine being short
[07:00:51] though sorry enjoying your sweet
[07:00:54] dream yeah that's a great idea wow no
[07:00:59] wonder you are the leader of of this
[07:01:02] sweet tree you're totally a
[07:01:06] lifesaver see you around Mr Sunday
[07:01:09] and it was nice chatting with
[07:01:15] you what's up sister this is the land of
[07:01:19] the
[07:01:20] dreams but why do they live like
[07:01:23] this the man we ran
[07:01:26] into he doesn't seem happy at
[07:01:29] all even those sweet dreams are nice
[07:01:32] they're just
[07:01:33] Illusions but for him they're the only
[07:01:36] way to survive even if it means giving
[07:01:38] up on
[07:01:39] reality that's not really living at
[07:01:43] all I suppose you have a
[07:01:45] point but in my opinion that's how most
[07:01:49] people live their lives why do you say
[07:01:52] that you think that man is not actually
[07:01:55] living but that's not quite
[07:01:58] accurate even without pentacon people
[07:02:01] create their own Illusions called self
[07:02:04] value people believe they have a
[07:02:06] predetermined value to fulfill gaining
[07:02:10] value means gaining power this guy talks
[07:02:12] like a super villain deemed worthless
[07:02:13] are seen as the
[07:02:15] weak however value doesn't come out of
[07:02:19] thin air and there's a limit to it to
[07:02:23] accumulate value people have to take
[07:02:26] from others so the weak get exploited
[07:02:30] talks like [ __ ] Bane
[07:02:32] are you suggesting that this is not how
[07:02:36] things should
[07:02:37] be
[07:02:38] exactly but
[07:02:41] ironically people don't think there's
[07:02:43] anything wrong with it because they
[07:02:45] uphold the elusory notion of self value
[07:02:49] and even the weak believe in
[07:02:51] it the survival of the
[07:02:54] fittest that's where all the tragedies
[07:02:56] in the world come
[07:02:58] from people come to the sweet dream in
[07:03:01] pen con to escape from that reality and
[07:03:05] find Solace no tragedies exist here only
[07:03:09] happiness although in its nent
[07:03:12] form isn't that the same Paradise we
[07:03:15] yearn for in our
[07:03:19] dreams perhaps that man is just an
[07:03:23] exception let's not jump to
[07:03:25] conclusions we should experience the
[07:03:27] Dreamscape
[07:03:29] ourselves just as I did at dream FL Reef
[07:03:32] yes seeing is
[07:03:35] believing I'll accompany you the dream
[07:03:38] master hasn't shown up yet so we have
[07:03:40] some time for a
[07:03:45] stroll oh
[07:03:47] PG water heats the cloud
[07:03:52] song glad to meet you again Robin how
[07:03:55] are the preparations for the Charmin
[07:03:57] Festival coming along we're all so
[07:04:00] excited about it y I'm so [ __ ] hungry
[07:04:03] it's going
[07:04:04] smoothly you're too kind Robin it's a
[07:04:07] pleasure to have guests from I can't
[07:04:09] stand being lonely or bored so this
[07:04:11] jubilant Dreamscape is perfect for me
[07:04:14] but if this went on forever would it get
[07:04:17] boring
[07:04:19] too n not at all who would get tired of
[07:04:23] having so much fun every day you get to
[07:04:26] wear fancy clothes uh explore all sorts
[07:04:29] of dream bubbles indulge in delicious
[07:04:32] food without gaining weight and you
[07:04:35] never get old or sick as long as you can
[07:04:38] afford a room this place is the ultimate
[07:04:42] Paradise but you know that only a few
[07:04:45] things can be brought back from the
[07:04:47] Dreamscape to reality
[07:04:49] right that's exactly why I don't plan on
[07:04:52] bringing anything back just enjoying the
[07:04:55] dream itself is good enough for me I
[07:04:58] mean I'm not one of those long living
[07:05:01] species I only have around 60 or only in
[07:05:04] this sweet dream can I truly feel like
[07:05:06] I'm in control of my life and fate who
[07:05:09] would want to go back to reality after
[07:05:11] what if pen what if Penton is a what if
[07:05:13] Penton want that chat Z take incoming
[07:05:16] new to stream what if penacon is a
[07:05:18] metaphor for playing honkey star rail as
[07:05:21] an escape from your life and then you go
[07:05:23] to pentony you play your gacha game to
[07:05:25] escape from the harsh
[07:05:27] reality and then the moral of the story
[07:05:29] is to uninstall and that's what's going
[07:05:31] to be like when we finish the last ball
[07:05:32] I don't
[07:05:33] know I
[07:05:35] see I genuinely wish you all the
[07:05:39] happiness in the
[07:05:43] world and I wish you a fantastic
[07:05:46] performance Robin I'm off to the blue
[07:05:48] hour for the ball see you
[07:05:52] later I'm an escapism expert seems like
[07:05:56] that guest's perspective didn't resonate
[07:05:58] with you that's like my technique that's
[07:06:00] my e She had a valid point I could sense
[07:06:04] her genuine
[07:06:05] happiness it's just
[07:06:11] that hello what you're trying to say is
[07:06:16] she thinks she's in control of her life
[07:06:19] but in reality she's just escaping from
[07:06:22] reality and seeking solace in this sweet
[07:06:25] dream once she steps out of this
[07:06:28] Sanctuary everything will be lost
[07:06:32] well she did make mention of being able
[07:06:35] to afford a
[07:06:36] room didn't
[07:06:43] she
[07:06:49] B however the Paradise in our
[07:06:53] dreams it doesn't have to
[07:06:58] end no in the paradise we year
[07:07:02] for shouldn't be just a fleeting dream
[07:07:11] either
[07:07:15] deal wait would you guys actually be mad
[07:07:17] at
[07:07:18] me if I put Subway Surfer on the
[07:07:25] side the scene in this Dreamscape is
[07:07:28] truly
[07:07:29] breathtaking isn't it
[07:07:33] oh Robin can't believe I'm meeting you
[07:07:36] in person you're right even though time
[07:07:40] stands still in this Dreamscape it
[07:07:42] always feels fresh I find something new
[07:07:46] every
[07:07:47] time a philosophical
[07:07:49] mind I hope I'm not
[07:07:52] intruding oh not at all H with little
[07:07:55] time left I yearn for Meaningful
[07:07:59] conversations especially with someone as
[07:08:01] esteemed as you it's my pleasure no need
[07:08:05] to be
[07:08:06] formal yeah I was part of a war and
[07:08:10] while escaping from the sosian Mother
[07:08:12] Ship I got exposed to some radioactive
[07:08:16] materials and then all my comrades died
[07:08:20] wait are my game sounds too low my
[07:08:22] hometown wiped out by neutral I getting
[07:08:24] one
[07:08:25] gu I couldn't bear to live with
[07:08:29] everything I knew gone
[07:08:34] how heart
[07:08:38] wrenching I hope the family has been
[07:08:40] able to help you just a little bit quiet
[07:08:43] okay and I'm truly grateful for that
[07:08:47] they provided me with a comfortable room
[07:08:49] the most advanced life supports in the
[07:08:51] cosmos and a stellar team of
[07:08:55] caregivers my physical body is now in
[07:08:57] the dream pool sustained by life support
[07:09:01] the me you see here is whole rational
[07:09:04] and no different from any other person
[07:09:06] my true
[07:09:07] appearance
[07:09:09] oh I hope you never
[07:09:12] so you'll be living
[07:09:15] forever just being able to live at all
[07:09:17] is good enough for me now whether it's
[07:09:20] in this I don't think this part is bad
[07:09:21] or anything but I think this is like I
[07:09:22] feel like they're saying things like I
[07:09:24] key already knew or they're just like
[07:09:25] giving me examples like real life people
[07:09:27] but like my world has been torn apart
[07:09:31] and my life could end any like I feel
[07:09:33] like my knowledge of Penton an hour ago
[07:09:35] and now is the same even if this whole
[07:09:37] place is an illusion it's still my
[07:09:41] paradise and I'll treasure every moment
[07:09:43] I spend
[07:09:45] here now I envy those Everlasting
[07:09:50] things that old man's
[07:09:53] story it's so
[07:09:56] tragic
[07:09:58] fortunately this sweet dream gives him
[07:10:00] joyful memor still holds on to I mean
[07:10:02] yeah but okay for the rest of his life
[07:10:04] it's more about Sunday and Robin's
[07:10:06] ideologies okay but didn't we know that
[07:10:07] like from the bird Sunday was like cage
[07:10:09] it and make sure it doesn't die because
[07:10:11] it's going to eventually like fly into a
[07:10:13] wall and kill itself and then Robin was
[07:10:14] like let it free let the bird fly that
[07:10:16] was 2 hours
[07:10:18] ago I feel like that was basically what
[07:10:21] we're seeing
[07:10:25] now that's precise getting
[07:10:28] deeper I'm not look I'm not a writer
[07:10:30] they're than me I'm I'm not complaining
[07:10:32] I'm just saying even s has its
[07:10:36] limitations while it provides Solace to
[07:10:39] the
[07:10:40] disillusioned it can't completely
[07:10:42] eliminate pain in
[07:10:44] reality there will be a way
[07:10:47] out penacon is already on the right
[07:10:50] track okay I'm not eating so I'll go let
[07:10:53] me just go wash my hands just my last

[07:16:40] dream it can't erase the worries and
[07:16:43] pain of reality or bring to
[07:16:46] happiness remember the old man we met
[07:16:49] earlier without this dream he might have
[07:16:52] completely lost
[07:16:54] himself that might be true
[07:16:58] but even without pentacon
[07:17:01] he could have chosen another
[07:17:03] path as far as I know the intelligencia
[07:17:07] guild has been promoting their
[07:17:08] Rehabilitation techniques for a long
[07:17:10] time now okay that path may have been
[07:17:13] more ordinary and
[07:17:15] challenging but now he's receiving
[07:17:18] Hospice Care in a com State and his fate
[07:17:22] who says your fate is sealed I feel like
[07:17:23] that's a voice line I don't know from
[07:17:25] what game your fate is
[07:17:27] sealed or is it taking it away from them
[07:17:30] well
[07:17:31] don't forget this not every okay my bad
[07:17:37] the future for Humanity is like the sky
[07:17:39] for
[07:17:40] Birds people mistakingly believe that
[07:17:43] flight is inherent to Birds because
[07:17:45] they've never witnessed those bird this
[07:17:47] is he said this 2 hours
[07:17:51] ago brother like it's the same I just I
[07:17:55] just said it's okay sorry you remember
[07:17:57] how we took in that little Charming this
[07:17:59] is this is literally the same
[07:18:01] is am I am I [ __ ] Deja Vu am I am I
[07:18:03] hallucinating is this not the same qu is
[07:18:05] this not what happened two years ago I'm
[07:18:08] sorry yeah oh cuz there's no Pon they
[07:18:11] have to repeat okay fair enough food and
[07:18:13] water cuz in genin the difference is in
[07:18:15] genjin I skip Pon so I don't see the
[07:18:17] extra stuff okay I decided to leave
[07:18:21] penone I opened the cage and set it free
[07:18:24] okay this is new this is new well
[07:18:26] I I didn't mention what happened to it
[07:18:29] in my letters because I didn't want to
[07:18:31] upset you okay shortly after you left oh
[07:18:35] crashed to its death right in front of
[07:18:37] your
[07:18:41] window when I had a bird we we would let
[07:18:43] it fly in my room and one time it
[07:18:45] [ __ ] ran into the wall cuz it's dumb
[07:18:47] like it was fine but it like ran into
[07:18:49] the
[07:18:51] wall I had surmised as much I knew you
[07:18:55] wouldn't have avoided mentioning the
[07:18:56] bird for no reason despite that
[07:18:59] unfortunate
[07:19:02] I still believe it was the right
[07:19:04] decision Birds aren't meant to spend
[07:19:07] their lives in
[07:19:08] cages they belong in the
[07:19:11] sky even if they can't
[07:19:13] fly but here's the thing if there are
[07:19:16] birds in this world that can never fly
[07:19:19] can we really assert that they belong in
[07:19:22] the
[07:19:26] sky are you implying that the same goes
[07:19:30] for humans too
[07:19:35] uhoh let's take the astral Express as an
[07:19:39] example
[07:19:40] theous efforts to bridge worlds gaining
[07:19:44] Fame Across the
[07:19:46] Universe however only a few
[07:19:49] extraordinary individuals can endure
[07:19:51] such a perilous
[07:19:53] Journey that's because the pursuit of
[07:19:56] the trailblaze exceeds the capabilities
[07:19:59] of ordinary humans
[07:20:02] otherwise why would this path be filled
[07:20:04] with broken rails and abandoned Express
[07:20:08] and even a fallen
[07:20:12] Eon that's just sophistry what is let me
[07:20:16] look up sof sorry then only the powerful
[07:20:19] would have the right to determine the
[07:20:23] future use of fallacious arguments
[07:20:26] especially with the intentions of
[07:20:27] deceiving okay
[07:20:29] FCI okay
[07:20:32] unfortunately that's exactly what
[07:20:35] happens another name for the future is
[07:20:38] self
[07:20:40] value while this world has its fair
[07:20:43] share of Heroes who inspire people and
[07:20:46] Garner admiration for their heroic Deeds
[07:20:48] the majority of ordinary people will
[07:20:51] never become heroes in their
[07:20:56] lifetime some are born weak and
[07:20:59] vulnerable like this guy like Bane and
[07:21:01] Thanos had a baby
[07:21:03] circumstances some fall victim to malice
[07:21:06] and
[07:21:07] cowardice when it comes to survival
[07:21:10] everyone is equal and the weak can only
[07:21:13] watch as their value gets constantly
[07:21:16] diminished by external forces that's why
[07:21:19] we should care for the weak and support
[07:21:21] them as if their suffering were our own
[07:21:24] that's what the ODS of Harmony have
[07:21:26] always taught us so true Robin
[07:21:30] while the harmony holds Noble
[07:21:33] aspirations the strong will always be
[07:21:36] strong and the weak will always be
[07:21:40] weak even in this Carefree
[07:21:43] dream human nature contains greatness
[07:21:47] but it also Harbors inherent weaknesses
[07:21:50] that can't be
[07:21:51] eradicated in the end if people can't
[07:21:55] even secure their own
[07:21:56] Survival they won't care about the
[07:21:59] elusory future of
[07:22:01] quality as long as the law of survival
[07:22:04] of the fittest
[07:22:06] prevails there will always be fledglings
[07:22:08] crashing to their death okay I'm not
[07:22:11] even exaggerating you can look up famous
[07:22:13] quotes of like okay if you if you if I
[07:22:16] say a quote from either Sunday or like a
[07:22:18] dictator you won't be able to tell which
[07:22:20] is like a movie villain you won't be
[07:22:22] able to tell which is which like I
[07:22:23] looked up Thanos quotes
[07:22:32] I know what it's like to lose your
[07:22:34] planet was on the brink of collapse I'm
[07:22:36] the one who stopped that the hardest
[07:22:39] choices require the strongest
[07:22:52] Wills you could not live with your own
[07:22:54] failure and where did that bring
[07:22:56] you okay
[07:22:58] sorry but if people people don't live
[07:23:01] for the future I like villains there's
[07:23:03] nothing wrong with that
[07:23:05] survival if even you my brother don't
[07:23:10] believe that the harmony will I mean I
[07:23:12] guess he is kind of a dictator lowy can
[07:23:15] make our dreams come
[07:23:20] true I feel like there's two way this
[07:23:22] goes either we just [ __ ] fight him
[07:23:23] and we win or he's like super strong and
[07:23:26] he's like Robin's like no stop it Sunday
[07:23:28] and then he's like my sister and then he
[07:23:30] gives
[07:23:35] up why did your mom hear my
[07:23:43] stream people often forget that when the
[07:23:47] first bird took flight the entire world
[07:23:50] envisioned a future where where every
[07:23:52] bird could fly but little did they know
[07:23:55] that the themselves as a bird would
[07:23:57] crash into a wall no more FL ledg Lings
[07:24:00] would ever crash to their
[07:24:03] death are you reading sister what are
[07:24:06] you reading Mr Gul for what gave me a
[07:24:09] picture book it's about the story of the
[07:24:12] harmonic strings if I could become a
[07:24:14] cord Master harmonic Whimsy
[07:24:17] suon dominicus the harmonious
[07:24:21] choir I want to sing with everyone and
[07:24:24] spread our wishes so that all can feel
[07:24:26] happiness and joy I
[07:24:29] see then
[07:24:31] I would summon the harmonious choir too
[07:24:34] don't you have a wish of your own wait
[07:24:36] isn't that a guy from like uh Street
[07:24:39] Fighter
[07:24:40] guile wait it is wait his theme is fire
[07:24:58] [Music]
[07:25:00] wait what the [ __ ] is
[07:25:02] guess guess I looked it up devoid of gu
[07:25:06] what is gu Sly or cunning
[07:25:11] intelligence innocent and without
[07:25:12] deception is guess okay yeah of course
[07:25:16] like innocent it's just that it includes
[07:25:20] your wish and everyone
[07:25:23] else's I long for a true Paradise where
[07:25:28] everyone can find peace
[07:25:31] let's build a stage there and invite
[07:25:33] everyone to our performance so that both
[07:25:36] our wishes come true through the power
[07:25:38] of the harmonious choir it's a deal then
[07:25:41] yeah it's a
[07:25:43] deal but how can I become a cord Master
[07:25:47] bro I study in French stop saying my
[07:25:49] vocabulary sucks of course it does
[07:25:51] [ __ ] Okay I literally went to
[07:25:55] primary school middle school high school
[07:25:57] uh CP and University incl in in
[07:26:02] French so when I have to read books
[07:26:04] they're all French maybe you will have
[07:26:07] to become a star
[07:26:16] first eight what the [ __ ] that was 1
[07:26:19] hour [ __ ] we're [ __ ] last time it was
[07:26:23] nine and now it's up to us to forge
[07:26:28] ahead since he's already already carried
[07:26:30] out his last wish my final mission is
[07:26:33] complete but pardon me if I sound Kurt
[07:26:37] it's good to have
[07:26:39] determination the path M left for you is
[07:26:42] not an easy one to
[07:26:44] tread why is
[07:26:46] Gallagher okay so I was looking at blade
[07:26:48] right in the car and he had a suit on
[07:26:50] with his like thing unbuttoned and the
[07:26:52] the the tie down like this I was like
[07:26:53] okay he probably had the tie up for like
[07:26:55] a meeting and then took it off to drive
[07:26:57] Gallagher this guy it's like why is this
[07:26:59] tie down with a button open and no like
[07:27:02] a a
[07:27:05] choker why else would he have chosen to
[07:27:08] sleep in solitude staking everything on
[07:27:11] some nameless in the future now do you
[07:27:14] have the
[07:27:15] numbers and in numbers comes
[07:27:19] strength oh God any more encouraging
[07:27:23] words as I see it relying on welts
[07:27:26] negotiations alone is far from enough
[07:27:29] we're almost done regardless of whether
[07:27:31] the other party will be compliant
[07:27:33] negotiating simply allows them as equals
[07:27:37] and won't grant us an upper hand pone is
[07:27:40] our rival's home turf and we already
[07:27:44] have very few chips left to play with
[07:27:47] rather than idly sit around while the
[07:27:49] families got us blocked off an offensive
[07:27:52] approach might be a wiser course of
[07:27:56] action we're more familiar with the
[07:27:58] stellon properties than most and since
[07:28:01] it's the key to stabilizing the sweet
[07:28:04] dream it's vital to the family's
[07:28:06] interests by attacking their core
[07:28:09] interests they're bound to retaliate
[07:28:12] hastily and as the saying goes haste
[07:28:15] makes waste true that's right as long as
[07:28:19] we pose a threat to the stellon either
[07:28:21] with words or otherwise we have a chance
[07:28:23] at gaining the upper hand but the
[07:28:25] problem is on the eve of the Charmy
[07:28:28] Festival opening how exactly are we
[07:28:31] going to get close to the theater Family
[07:28:33] Security will be airtight and if we
[07:28:35] brute force
[07:28:37] it even if we succeed it's too
[07:28:44] risky so no one's going to say
[07:28:47] anything then I'll raise my hand I know
[07:28:50] the answer to this question Yeah March
[07:28:52] what's up you have all people
[07:28:55] whoa of course you do looks like we have
[07:28:58] one more Ace of on sleeves time for the
[07:29:00] Master
[07:29:05] stroke the cre would have been disbanded
[07:29:09] long ago if it weren't for me so I heard
[07:29:12] that before the Charmy Festival begins
[07:29:15] there will be a pageant to kick off the
[07:29:17] festival it's called The Soul glad TM
[07:29:20] festivity audition why did she read out
[07:29:22] TM something and it's going to be held
[07:29:24] in the moment of scorge sand as long as
[07:29:27] we clinch the top spot we'll be able to
[07:29:29] attain the title of festive Superstar
[07:29:32] and be able to personally bask in The
[07:29:34] Graces of Miss
[07:29:36] Robin not that that's important what's
[07:29:39] crucial is that we can enter The Grand
[07:29:41] Theater so how do we go about
[07:29:44] participating in these festivity
[07:29:48] auditions I've already procured special
[07:29:51] invite tickets from Miss Robin's fan
[07:29:54] club to tell you the truth I had been
[07:29:57] preparing to join the auditions all
[07:29:59] along
[07:30:00] but now it looks like even if I scrape
[07:30:03] through I probably still won't have the
[07:30:06] chance to shake Miss Robin's hand so
[07:30:08] they're still running this thing
[07:30:11] huh it was originally just a publicity
[07:30:14] stunt set up by male to drum up
[07:30:17] attention we'll follow Mar's plan I'm
[07:30:20] afraid I won't have the
[07:30:22] time fictionist that's such a fake job
[07:30:26] already completed my final mission as a
[07:30:28] Fields crafter we pentac I ensure a
[07:30:30] spread
[07:30:31] misinformation all down to
[07:30:33] you the next part is long and monotonous
[07:30:37] wait you're trolling why is everyone

[07:36:49] personality okay
[07:36:52] what there's a difference I okay the
[07:36:54] tier list here's the tier list
[07:37:06] perality
[07:37:09] tier
[07:37:12] list okay top tier
[07:37:16] is
[07:37:18] good
[07:37:21] slash
[07:37:24] unique
[07:37:26] personality then under is is like
[07:37:29] neutral right they don't really you know
[07:37:32] whatever then it's
[07:37:35] bad slash
[07:37:38] cringe then right under
[07:37:44] here is
[07:37:55] still n you're bugging okay but like
[07:37:59] what would the those voice lines I just
[07:38:00] saw sorry
[07:38:02] sorry okay but in the defense of this
[07:38:05] game I Al in the defense of star rail I
[07:38:06] would also put lumine and Rover there
[07:38:09] they're all there I don't give a
[07:38:13] [ __ ] what would you rather have Kratos
[07:38:16] God of War that's what I would rather
[07:38:19] have I'd rather
[07:38:23] have they're cringe but it doesn't make
[07:38:26] them bad okay then they're in this tier
[07:38:28] which is in my opinion worse than
[07:38:29] neutral I think good M like good is is s
[07:38:34] tier neutral is like C and then cringe
[07:38:36] is like
[07:38:39] d sorry back to the quest what's
[07:38:42] happening
[07:38:46] depart it's like funny cringe brother
[07:38:49] the last voice line was whole up you
[07:38:51] didn't ask for consent that is not the
[07:38:54] good type of
[07:38:55] cringe were we reading the same voice
[07:38:58] lines allow me to introduce the rules of
[07:39:00] this challenge to
[07:39:02] you there are three stages up ahead on

[07:39:18] love with [ __ ] Rover perance or
[07:39:20] stelle whatever the [ __ ] her name is
[07:39:23] also a bit of trivia the record score
[07:39:26] for this stage is held by a participant
[07:39:28] with fire red hair his exceptional
[07:39:31] performance brought even the strictest
[07:39:33] judge to

[08:01:06] I mean true that's
[08:01:08] fair your endeavors are worthy of extra
[08:01:12] recognition and I've taken steps to
[08:01:14] ensure that however this reward is not a
[08:01:19] material one what's upie but rather the
[08:01:21] opportunity for an open and honest
[08:01:24] communication between us as previously
[08:01:27] oh [ __ ] I didn't my sister Mr Yang and I
[08:01:31] have met with the dream master we delved
[08:01:34] into the truth about penacon and its
[08:01:37] stellon and have come to a consensus
[08:01:40] both I and the oak family cannot acques
[08:01:45] to your
[08:01:47] request
[08:01:49] acques the act of or condition of
[08:01:52] acquiescing or giving tacit Ascent
[08:01:55] agreement or consent by silence or
[08:01:56] without objection
[08:01:58] oh wait I learned about this okay but I
[08:02:00] learned this in
[08:02:01] French I learned this though I learned
[08:02:03] about this though I remember my teacher
[08:02:04] gave me a bonus point cuz he said he
[08:02:06] said in class he said in class silence
[08:02:09] never equates to consent and then in an
[08:02:11] exam uh uh uh there was a example of
[08:02:14] implicit consent where you enter a taxi
[08:02:16] uh and in the taxi it's like you
[08:02:17] implicitly consent to paying the Taxi's
[08:02:20] Fair even though the taxi driver was
[08:02:22] like are you going to pay me for driving
[08:02:23] you there you like implicitly did it you
[08:02:25] implicitly uh agreed
[08:02:28] by silence
[08:02:33] anyways just as expected we acknowledge
[08:02:37] the perspective of you
[08:02:39] nameless pentacon did he only learn one
[08:02:42] thing in school but not as you
[08:02:45] suppose the planet of festivities cannot
[08:02:48] and will not revert to a place
[08:02:50] characterized by chaos disorder or
[08:02:54] Anarchy
[08:02:58] through your journey of overcoming
[08:03:00] obstacles you must have glimpsed the
[08:03:02] essence of that era the vulnerable
[08:03:05] ruthlessly eliminated equality
[08:03:09] non-existent common folk living
[08:03:11] precarious lives eing out a dreary
[08:03:16] existence quick pop quiz what is Sam
[08:03:19] step up your game join hell spin today I
[08:03:21] had a meme and I clicked on a video and
[08:03:23] I got an
[08:03:25] ad what does Sam uh stand for Sam is
[08:03:29] abbreviation that stands for strategic
[08:03:31] assault
[08:03:32] Mech
[08:03:34] Bravo ultimately only Heroes like
[08:03:38] yourselves manage to achieve success no
[08:03:41] it doesn't yes it is loser sorry I
[08:03:43] didn't mean to call you loser it does
[08:03:44] though I remember Firefly told us I
[08:03:45] wrote it down but I would dare ask if
[08:03:49] you did not possess the special status
[08:03:51] of having a stellon and you were but an
[08:03:54] anonymous and frail member among the
[08:03:57] masses
[08:03:58] which pentacon would you prefer the one
[08:04:01] without you bozo give me Robin a
[08:04:03] dystopia for the survival of the fittest
[08:04:06] yes or a sweet dream Paradise for
[08:04:10] all there's nothing wrong with being the
[08:04:12] fittest I don't know why are you asking
[08:04:14] me
[08:04:22] true it's not the point don't let him
[08:04:26] mislead you Mr Sunday even if the
[08:04:29] members of the oak family can't fully
[08:04:31] agree on what to do about the stellon
[08:04:34] now's not exactly the time to be holding
[08:04:36] an extensive discourse about penton's
[08:04:39] past is it the stellon issue concerns
[08:04:42] the life and death of everyone on
[08:04:44] pentacon if anyone has a better
[08:04:46] suggestion the crew is more than willing
[08:04:48] to listen this way we'll at least know
[08:04:50] what welt and miss Robin are dealing
[08:04:52] with and the reason why they failed to
[08:04:54] make our
[08:04:56] appointment ah
[08:04:58] navigator that is precisely my
[08:05:01] intention with all present let's begin
[08:05:05] by discussing the details of that
[08:05:07] meeting let's talk about our
[08:05:09] tribulations and choices our ideals and
[08:05:13] beliefs and our final course of action
[08:05:17] the only path to
[08:05:21] take something on to
[08:05:24] death a while ago you mean to say oh
[08:05:28] [ __ ] it's O for the longest time there
[08:05:30] have been Scoundrels who would
[08:05:34] use fesal that I have bequeathed to the
[08:05:38] mass as a tool to realize their ambition
[08:05:43] indeed dream master once the Charmy
[08:05:46] Festival begins the stellon powers along
[08:05:49] with the song will be broadcast across
[08:05:52] the entire planet of
[08:05:55] pentacon this is indeed surpr in to
[08:05:59] me the Dreamscape is maintained by the
[08:06:02] collective effort of the five
[08:06:05] families if someone were to use the
[08:06:07] charm Festival to recklessly disseminate
[08:06:11] the power of the
[08:06:13] stellon this individual must hold a
[08:06:16] position of great Authority do you have
[08:06:20] any suspects I'd like to ask did you
[08:06:24] really not know of the Stellar Ron's
[08:06:26] existence
[08:06:29] H I would have never thought that this
[08:06:34] nameless would points the spear at me if
[08:06:37] I have offended the astral Express
[08:06:40] extends its sincere
[08:06:42] apologies but the current circumstances
[08:06:45] are dire and leave no room for
[08:06:47] meticulous inquiry we're doing this out
[08:06:50] of concern for the Dreamscapes safety so
[08:06:54] if you could please alleviate our
[08:06:59] concerns dream master it's just to prove
[08:07:02] that the charm Festival has nothing to
[08:07:05] do with the
[08:07:06] stellon if we're being overly
[08:07:09] cautious I will return to the stage to
[08:07:11] offer tribute and song Just per the
[08:07:16] arrangement
[08:07:18] Sunday
[08:07:20] robinin I've watched you two grow up
[08:07:23] okay and know your dispositions like the
[08:07:26] back of my hand there a piss Fountain
[08:07:28] both of you right now can surely be loed
[08:07:32] as their most devout
[08:07:35] Advocates I already know your resolve
[08:07:38] the magnitude of this matter is enormous
[08:07:42] and cannot be taken lightly since Mr
[08:07:45] Yang has asked with such earnestness I
[08:07:49] will personally respond and kind if
[08:07:53] there is a need the entire that Soul
[08:07:56] glad that's what the the government
[08:07:59] wants you to believe it's
[08:08:02] piss somay might I ask you to beseech
[08:08:06] them to cast their light onto me and
[08:08:09] question me in their stead so that no
[08:08:13] lies may be concealed I will do as you
[08:08:17] command Rob could thanks for ruining
[08:08:20] peny for me I mean Soul glad is
[08:08:22] basically beer and cheap beer tastes
[08:08:24] like piss anyways so it's basically it's
[08:08:26] it makes sense
[08:08:28] that all land may be utterly
[08:08:31] dispelled I will do as you command May
[08:08:35] th will be carried out on Earth just as
[08:08:39] it is in the heavens oh triplef faced
[08:08:43] Soul please sear his tongue and Palms
[08:08:46] with a hot iron so that he will not be
[08:08:49] able to fabricate lies and make false
[08:08:52] vows let us begin there is nothing else
[08:08:57] to
[08:08:59] understood again
[08:09:02] question have you devoted your life to
[08:09:05] your God never worshiping other gods
[08:09:10] naturally do you love your God as you do
[08:09:13] yourself always heeding their
[08:09:17] admonishments naturally have you strayed
[08:09:20] from the path expected by your God
[08:09:23] betraying their name never have you ever
[08:09:26] been in inordinate with your asks of
[08:09:28] your God coveting more than the
[08:09:31] foundation of the creation itself never
[08:09:34] never then a final
[08:09:39] question do you swear to fulfill all
[08:09:42] vows past present and future naturally
[08:09:47] with the Eon my witness if I do not
[08:09:50] deliver on my words or if I reneg on my
[08:09:54] vows may I be cursed in accordance with
[08:09:58] Divine Law they have seen your faith and
[08:10:03] have endorsed your
[08:10:04] faith with this it can be evidenced just
[08:10:09] a moment oh he said objection what is it
[08:10:12] Mr Yang I have another question I hope
[08:10:15] to have answered to my understanding the
[08:10:18] family's Harmony and prosperity have
[08:10:21] never relied on so-called div
[08:10:24] interesting the god you both mentioned
[08:10:28] are they truly
[08:10:33] sheepe Mr Yang should know that those
[08:10:36] belonging to the family toil together as
[08:10:40] if they were kin embracing solidarity
[08:10:44] and unity under their
[08:10:46] Liv all duplicity is this doesn't sound
[08:10:49] very harmonious of you dream master such
[08:10:52] a delicate and complex
[08:10:55] Symphony which other God could perfectly
[08:10:59] harmonize this if not for the great one
[08:11:03] she perfectly
[08:11:05] harmonize therein lies the problem it
[08:11:09] isn't an outsider lurking in the shadows
[08:11:12] who changed the harmony but a dissonance
[08:11:14] that has surreptitiously emerged from
[08:11:17] within this very Symphony itself in the
[08:11:20] distant past there existed an eon with
[08:11:24] one flick of the wrist they crafted the
[08:11:26] laws of the cosmos their followers
[08:11:29] formed the beyond the sky choir
[08:11:32] spreading solemn and reverent hymns
[08:11:35] throughout the Universe later they fell
[08:11:39] the route traversed by this Eon clashed
[08:11:42] with the harmony ultimately being
[08:11:44] absorbed and fused into it the chorus
[08:11:48] that once reverberated across worlds
[08:11:50] fell silent and when it echoed a new it
[08:11:54] was transformed into the hymn of Harmon
[08:11:57] though an eon May perish paths with no
[08:12:01] Masters still linger in the all
[08:12:04] forgiving Harmony Echoes of bygone
[08:12:07] dissonance May subtly arise okay Mr Yang
[08:12:12] being overly aute can be a
[08:12:15] detriment especially when you find this
[08:12:18] guy has a black hole in his staff he'll
[08:12:19] be fine and without
[08:12:23] allies so this is how it is
[08:12:28] for the sake of our grand car Sunday
[08:12:32] please to an opportunity to
[08:12:35] rest
[08:12:38] what
[08:12:40] uh-oh
[08:12:46] uh-oh sorry Robin it's just
[08:12:51] you I did not wish for you to know this
[08:12:58] it's a Pity that things have turned out
[08:13:00] this
[08:13:01] way so this is the true reason I can't
[08:13:05] sing the shadow that envelops penacon is
[08:13:09] actually we were never Children of the
[08:13:12] haunt Sunday you [ __ ] our ideal
[08:13:15] Paradise could not have been crafted by
[08:13:19] sheipe true Bliss can only be guaranteed
[08:13:23] by the one who transcends the many
[08:13:29] within the foundation of law Humanity
[08:13:32] establishes civilization and through
[08:13:35] Harmony we obtain
[08:13:44] order unbelievable who the [ __ ] is
[08:13:48] order remnants of
[08:13:51] Le what have you done with Mr Yang and
[08:13:54] miss Robin let me look up order

[08:14:05] Star rail it corresponds wait is it
[08:14:07] going it corresponds with the Aon
[08:14:09] Ena oh this [ __ ] I've seen them
[08:14:11] in [ __ ] golden
[08:14:19] gears they were absorbed by
[08:14:22] sheepe
[08:14:24] oh L Skipper bro do do you think I read
[08:14:27] every popup in
[08:14:29] [Music]
[08:14:35] swarm
[08:14:37] okay don't worry I just gave them some
[08:14:41] time alone to ponder their Fai wait so
[08:14:43] what if he comes out and he releases A
[08:14:45] New Path the path of
[08:14:48] order you should know that these actions
[08:14:51] make you an enemy of the astral Express
[08:14:54] that'd be sick should we need to stand
[08:14:56] against the nameless it would only be
[08:14:59] myself and the oak family
[08:15:01] involved but we haven't reached that
[08:15:03] point yet you know his dead Okay so is
[08:15:05] [ __ ] himo But Here We Stand sorry
[08:15:08] your efforts for the justice of paniconi
[08:15:10] are evident to everyone and have been
[08:15:13] widely
[08:15:16] observed sorry sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[08:15:20] that was too far I was going to say
[08:15:21] tingu but I didn't want to I'm sorry I'm
[08:15:23] sorry I love you
[08:15:24] MCO I'm sorry I'm sorry you want us to
[08:15:27] talk ter stop beating around the bush
[08:15:29] and get to the point give Mr Yang back
[08:15:30] to us
[08:15:31] now oh I intend to she's dead no she's
[08:15:34] not it's another game she's fine look at
[08:15:35] her she's fine negotiation honai star
[08:15:38] himo she's fine if it is the order that
[08:15:40] drove
[08:15:42] imprison and you're using them to coers
[08:15:44] our compliance then there'll be no point
[08:15:47] in entertaining any type of
[08:15:49] discussion you mistaken Miss
[08:15:52] heiko they are in very safe hands and
[08:15:56] just as the family has always proclaimed
[08:15:59] no one can be harmed in the Dreamscape
[08:16:01] least of all in the beautiful new world
[08:16:04] belonging to the order penacon and the
[08:16:06] entire universe have witnessed far too
[08:16:09] much innocent
[08:16:11] Bloodshed the strong wield their blades
[08:16:14] against the weak and the victors push
[08:16:17] the vanquished to the brink of
[08:16:19] Life natural
[08:16:22] selection the world abides by this
[08:16:24] principle establishing the well being of
[08:16:27] humanity at top the corpses of the
[08:16:31] downtrodden only we were rather I
[08:16:37] possess the power to put an end to this
[08:16:41] farce so you've decided to resurrect a
[08:16:44] dead
[08:16:45] Eon no one's ever done such a thing if
[08:16:48] Miss himiko is interested let's draw
[08:16:51] back the veil and speak candidly I've
[08:16:55] always firmly believed that people
[08:16:56] people can understand one another
[08:16:58] through peaceful means I'm willing to
[08:17:00] divulge the unembellished truth as to
[08:17:03] the intentions of the ORD path Striders
[08:17:07] so that you will make better judgment
[08:17:08] for the astral Express for penacon and
[08:17:12] for this stretch of the
[08:17:14] universe words can hardly do justice to
[08:17:16] the beauty of that ideal so come with me
[08:17:21] everyone let us retrace our steps and
[08:17:26] huh where'd he go welcome this isn't any
[08:17:30] location in penton's Dreamscape it's my
[08:17:34] inner World wait we're inside Sunday the
[08:17:36] reason the scenery how do you feel
[08:17:37] abouts unchanged is because your
[08:17:40] Consciousness has drawn on similar
[08:17:42] Concepts to fill in the
[08:17:46] gaps you imprison us did you do the same
[08:17:48] to welt it's a tuning process stronger
[08:17:52] in effect and more draining on the mind
[08:17:55] the gray-haired guest has experienced it
[08:17:57] before so she should understand what it
[08:18:00] entails tuning allows you to intuitively
[08:18:03] grasp my feelings which also means hide
[08:18:07] they predicted weing waves now everyone
[08:18:11] please look at the huge screen the road
[08:18:14] we once took begins
[08:18:17] here from this point on you will witness
[08:18:21] the numerous decisions I've faced I've
[08:18:24] selected a portion okay this part seems
[08:18:26] sick and I'm distracted cuz I need to go
[08:18:28] to the washroom give me a second I
[08:18:29] believe after going through similar
[08:18:31] predicament I'll be passed you'll be
[08:18:32] able to better understand

[08:28:53] skeletons left the closet had to go put
[08:28:55] that [ __ ] back in now we're
[08:28:59] here let's begin the first
[08:29:03] decision a story about a baby
[08:29:07] bird this story happened when Robin and
[08:29:10] I were very young okay we were victims
[08:29:13] of the stellon disaster and the family's
[08:29:17] Mr gopher wood who would later become
[08:29:20] the dream master of
[08:29:21] pentacon saw that we siblings had no one
[08:29:24] to turn to and took us in
[08:29:27] why is this guy called go for wood is
[08:29:29] there Robin and I lived a time with
[08:29:31] naria care in the world one day after
[08:29:35] dinner while my younger sister and I
[08:29:38] were lounging about same dude if Sunday
[08:29:40] was a streamer you guys would be typing
[08:29:42] same one story Charmy Dove all on its
[08:29:46] own that baby bird was Tiny it didn't
[08:29:50] even have all of its feathers and it
[08:29:53] couldn't
[08:29:54] sing when we found it
[08:29:56] it was already on its last breath really
[08:29:59] I've never heard of this before into a
[08:30:01] shrub probably abandoned by its parents
[08:30:04] wait there was a bird we decided to
[08:30:06] build a nest for it right there and
[08:30:09] then however thinking back that winter
[08:30:13] was unusually cold with Fierce winds at
[08:30:17] night in the yard not to mention the
[08:30:19] many poisonous bugs and wild Bible
[08:30:23] reference goph for wood
[08:30:26] gowood is a term used once in the Bible
[08:30:28] for the material used to construct
[08:30:30] Noah's
[08:30:31] Ark she's Skeleton on my closet till I
[08:30:34] Google doc what okay noted it was clear
[08:30:39] that if we left the fledgling in the
[08:30:41] yard it stood no chance of surviving
[08:30:44] until
[08:30:45] spring so I suggested we take it inside
[08:30:49] place it on the shelf by the window and
[08:30:52] asked the adults to Fashion a cage for
[08:30:54] it we we decided that when it regained
[08:30:57] its strength enough to spread its wings
[08:31:00] we would release it back into the
[08:31:03] wild the tragic part some yeah yeah the
[08:31:06] bird [ __ ] died we know you already
[08:31:09] told this this bird's fate had already
[08:31:11] been determined long before this
[08:31:14] moment its Destiny was determined by our
[08:31:18] momentary
[08:31:19] whim now I pass the Power of Choice to
[08:31:23] you all faced with this
[08:31:26] situation what choice would you make
[08:31:29] stick to the original plan and build a
[08:31:31] nest with soft net where the charm any
[08:31:34] Dove fell or build a cage for it and
[08:31:38] feed it giving it the utmost care from
[08:31:42] within the warmth of a h just give it a
[08:31:44] cage I eagerly await your
[08:31:47] answer okay hot okay okay I may be a hot
[08:31:51] take but like if if a lot of wild
[08:31:53] animals just die in the wild is it even
[08:31:55] that bad if domesticated and I'm like
[08:31:56] feeding them and like they're my homie I
[08:31:58] feel like they're living a good life I
[08:32:00] don't know unless you like cut its balls
[08:32:02] off but
[08:32:11] like are the cage for it y I'm happy to
[08:32:14] see that you made a choice similar to
[08:32:17] ours if your mind is made up let me
[08:32:20] reveal the outcome of this
[08:32:24] choice we passionately nursed it back to
[08:32:27] health preparing only the best food for
[08:32:30] it every day we even pred its
[08:32:33] feathers later on the day that Robin
[08:32:36] left penacon we opened the cage door and
[08:32:40] let it fly back into the sky I watched
[08:32:43] it for a long while by the window
[08:32:46] probably about three or so days in those
[08:32:49] I don't know why I agreed with Sunday
[08:32:51] sorry he's giving me a [ __ ] psychotic
[08:32:54] rant I'm sorry
[08:32:56] succeeded but its attempt did not go
[08:33:00] perfectly after flying UNS the fall
[08:33:03] shattered okay I get it the bird died
[08:33:05] regret the choices we
[08:33:08] made next let us head to the second
[08:33:11] decision this time it's the story of a
[08:33:16] Dreamchaser
[08:33:18] right this story happened when I was
[08:33:20] appointed as okay new story POG a
[08:33:23] position exclusive to the Oak family
[08:33:27] charged with listening to the problems
[08:33:29] and
[08:33:29] vexations Escape residence wait maybe
[08:33:32] this is actually I think we saw this
[08:33:33] this is when he was in the church it was
[08:33:35] during that period that I had the
[08:33:38] opportunity to hear voices from all
[08:33:40] corners of the
[08:33:42] Dreamscape he was a
[08:33:44] Dreamchaser and it's okay stow away it's
[08:33:47] not just like the rest of them know this
[08:33:51] I was there it was like an hour ago good
[08:33:54] except that to most most people the
[08:33:57] price he
[08:33:59] paid I suppose you could say it was
[08:34:02] everything he told me I sold everything
[08:34:06] heed his two children he had a plan in
[08:34:09] place he would buy back his children
[08:34:11] once he had made his fortune and enjoy
[08:34:14] penton's beautiful dream with
[08:34:17] them alas his plan to smuggle himself
[08:34:21] was somewhat clumsy and he was sniffed
[08:34:24] out by those Pig headed hounds after
[08:34:28] hearing the Dreamchaser story I
[08:34:30] immediately appealed to the blood hound
[08:34:32] family to cease their
[08:34:34] Pursuit that way at least he could live
[08:34:38] peacefully but I was still too naive to
[08:34:42] the ways of the
[08:34:43] world I did not anticipate that what I
[08:34:46] thought was a kind gesture I finished
[08:34:48] reading this in my had like 20 minutes
[08:34:49] 20 seconds ago and I'm just waiting for
[08:34:51] him to catch up cuz chat is slow sorry I
[08:34:53] could let you guys read sorry
[08:34:57] I'll tell you the outcome soon for now
[08:35:01] I'd like you all to make a choice will
[08:35:02] you do as I did and try to convince the
[08:35:05] blood hound family to stop their Pursuit
[08:35:08] so that the Dreamchaser may live
[08:35:10] peacefully and realize his wishes or
[08:35:13] will you remain silent leaving him to
[08:35:16] languish while the hounds are hot on his
[08:35:18] heels until his inevitable J I look
[08:35:21] forward to everyone's decisions wait
[08:35:23] can't you just like free the kids let
[08:35:25] them die
[08:35:26] if you have that much pull can't you
[08:35:27] just like buy the kid like like set them
[08:35:30] like I don't know buy them and then buy
[08:35:31] them
[08:35:31] food [ __ ] the guy let the guy die he
[08:35:34] sold his kids kill
[08:35:42] him but who takes care of them I mean
[08:35:44] you're Sunday you're rich just buy buy
[08:35:46] the kids then like give them to someone
[08:35:48] who's adopting and then give them food
[08:35:50] if no one's adopting then I don't know
[08:35:54] [ __ ] get them PC and make them Farm
[08:35:56] your dailies but then you like feed them
[08:35:58] and stuff it's fine just they'll play
[08:36:00] Goa games for you they'll be happy
[08:36:01] they'll play Goa games you'll like feed
[08:36:04] them they'll have to live a free and
[08:36:06] happy life but they play Goda
[08:36:13] [Laughter]
[08:36:15] games okay sorry feed them to the Swarm
[08:36:19] give them to
[08:36:20] arlino I don't know about that one
[08:36:36] it seems you like me are pondering
[08:36:39] whether a different Choice could have
[08:36:41] led to a better outcome say he never
[08:36:43] gets caught he would only die from
[08:36:46] delirium caught the methods with which
[08:36:49] illegal stowaways enter dreams are unor
[08:36:51] should he be
[08:36:53] apprehended could the hounds afford to
[08:36:55] turn a blind
[08:36:56] eye the answer is a definitive no as to
[08:37:01] your
[08:37:02] choice I once in the story this time oh
[08:37:05] a new story this story happened the day
[08:37:08] I was appointed the oak family head at
[08:37:12] that time Mr gopherwood was the current
[08:37:15] dream master and as for his wish we had
[08:37:19] a private conversation what surprised me
[08:37:22] was that the dream master had only come
[08:37:24] to deliver a letter to me he let me read
[08:37:27] its contents and it was a letter from my
[08:37:33] sister the letter contained the usual
[08:37:36] pleasantries anecdotes from her travels
[08:37:39] nothing out of the
[08:37:40] ordinary just as I started wondering how
[08:37:43] this letter related to our
[08:37:45] discussion the dream master began to
[08:37:48] speak do you know who wrote this letter
[08:37:52] my sister of course but why would would
[08:37:55] you personally visit me to hand me a
[08:37:57] letter from my sister containing mere
[08:38:00] trivialities uhoh to help you grasp the
[08:38:03] fal scope of this
[08:38:05] issue do you know where Robin is at this
[08:38:09] moment from what the letter indicates
[08:38:12] Cas
[08:38:13] VI has she mentioned anything about a
[08:38:16] stray bullet a stray bullet a war has
[08:38:20] broken out on that planet it is because
[08:38:23] of this very reason that Robin chose
[08:38:26] this
[08:38:27] destination to spread the word of the
[08:38:30] Harmony and to save the lives
[08:38:34] Planet she personally made for the front
[08:38:39] lines she hoped to ease the people's
[08:38:42] suffering with s and was willing to
[08:38:45] Brave mortal danger to deliver the ipc's
[08:38:48] medical
[08:38:49] supplies
[08:38:51] unfortunately stray bullets show no such
[08:38:57] compassion is she all
[08:39:01] right why did someone just type in my
[08:39:03] chat stelle is not cringe bro I said
[08:39:06] that 2 hours ago are you on Internet
[08:39:09] Explorer on your mobile
[08:39:11] device if the operation was successful
[08:39:15] she should probably be recovering in the
[08:39:18] field
[08:39:20] hospital by the Eon above the bullet
[08:39:24] struck her neck
[08:39:25] directly yet possibly as a reward for
[08:39:28] her consistent Deeds of Harmony it
[08:39:32] didn't hit any vital
[08:39:34] arteries once you've attended to your
[08:39:36] outstanding tasks it would be advisable
[08:39:39] to write her back as soon as
[08:39:42] possible those damned
[08:39:46] Savages I'll pack my bags right away my
[08:39:49] gratitude for bringing this to my
[08:39:51] attention Mr gopherwood
[08:39:53] now you understand why she always wears
[08:39:56] such elaborate neck ornaments well I
[08:39:58] didn't even notice how could this happen
[08:40:01] wait show me her neck all in the past so
[08:40:03] please don't worry I'm looking this up I
[08:40:06] share this in the HSR understand the
[08:40:09] harmony limitations and predicament oh
[08:40:12] yeah she has the strong defending the
[08:40:15] weak look up her E6 many times it is
[08:40:19] nothing more than wishful thinking
[08:40:30] [Music]
[08:40:39] there's nothing oh there's a hole wait
[08:40:41] is that my monitor that's
[08:40:43] dirty wait maybe my monitor is dirty oh
[08:40:45] no there is a
[08:40:57] yeah it is
[08:41:00] there
[08:41:02] likewise I've prepared one last question
[08:41:06] one last choice because this is merely a
[08:41:09] figment of
[08:41:11] imagination a nightmare that has haunted
[08:41:14] me through countless
[08:41:16] nights if you ever had the opportunity
[08:41:18] to make a choice like I did would you
[08:41:21] still support Robin's Journey on the
[08:41:23] path of Harmony yeah yes [ __ ] you
[08:41:26] [Music]
[08:41:28] Sunday the side Robin's
[08:41:46] Destiny I mean I'd support her but I'd
[08:41:48] probably be like hey maybe you shouldn't
[08:41:49] go on the front lines like you're
[08:41:50] probably going to die but like I support
[08:41:53] you like I wouldn't stop her from
[08:41:55] Harmony I'd probably just be like yo
[08:41:56] maybe don't book a flight
[08:42:06] there ask
[08:42:09] March wait you can talk to
[08:42:13] them you can't believe that happened to
[08:42:16] miss
[08:42:17] Robin the strong defending the week is a
[08:42:19] great Mantra but if I had to pay such a
[08:42:23] price
[08:42:32] I I often feel like I've dreamt of
[08:42:35] similar scenes on certain
[08:42:38] nights in the dream I see blurry
[08:42:43] faces their confusion and fear are Lucid
[08:42:47] to
[08:42:47] me but I also remember they chose never
[08:42:52] to give
[08:42:53] up if Mr Sunday's question leaves you
[08:42:57] puzzled you should find the answer from
[08:43:00] your own
[08:43:01] experiences with each Trail blaz dangers
[08:43:04] and tribulations will surely
[08:43:07] follow but would you ever back away yeah
[08:43:11] would you stop March I never back away
[08:43:13] reaching their next destination I mean I
[08:43:15] would I would tell you to stay in the
[08:43:15] ship youo so you don't die believe you
[08:43:17] have an answer of your own in
[08:43:21] your I said stop making numy run around
[08:43:24] dude he need needs exercise look at
[08:43:29] him
[08:43:40] sorry Miss Robin's courage is
[08:43:44] admirable and here I was thinking she
[08:43:46] was just another Superstar
[08:43:49] celebrity but the fact that she's also
[08:43:51] Mr Sunday's younger
[08:43:53] sister no I doubt he'd wish harm on his
[08:43:56] own flesh and
[08:44:09] blood well I'm going to support her but
[08:44:14] um I still don't think she should
[08:44:17] go like I be like yo maybe like pursue
[08:44:20] your path of Harmony but like don't go
[08:44:22] to the AC of War Zone maybe maybe just
[08:44:24] make like a heartfelt tweet about
[08:44:28] it welcome to
[08:44:32] my you know when Co started and like all
[08:44:34] the celebrities like sang imagine on
[08:44:37] like a zoom call just do
[08:44:46] that will he make this Choice
[08:44:50] yeah I
[08:44:53] see I am now aware of everyone's
[08:44:57] stances raising these questions merely
[08:45:00] serves to illustrate one
[08:45:02] point the fight of penacon cannot be
[08:45:05] salvaged welome to my War the true
[08:45:09] foundation for a sweet dream if I can
[08:45:11] stop one Z from stalling can only be
[08:45:13] established through the order where the
[08:45:16] strong govern the weak I know the
[08:45:19] suffering of being
[08:45:21] tormented the turmoil of losing your way
[08:45:25] how sorrow and even despair set in when
[08:45:29] matters don't work
[08:45:31] out all of this causes me unending
[08:45:34] pain because this is not what happiness
[08:45:37] is at
[08:45:39] all we must teach the weak how to live a
[08:45:42] happy life and this life isn't some
[08:45:45] Noble propriety that the Upper Crust
[08:45:48] preaches but in definitive terms a way
[08:45:51] of survival that belongs to everyone
[08:45:56] so what is your definition of living a
[08:45:58] happy
[08:46:00] life huh good
[08:46:03] question human consciousness is
[08:46:05] fundamentally an illusion a cage known
[08:46:08] as
[08:46:10] selfworth people lured in by this
[08:46:12] illusion make mistakes yet still ask
[08:46:16] that external influences bear the burden
[08:46:19] when one mistake after the next
[08:46:21] permeates the masses they become
[08:46:24] impossible to trace thus the amassing of
[08:46:28] these individual cages culminate to form
[08:46:31] a prison a place dictated only by the
[08:46:34] rule of survival of the F be like as a
[08:46:38] child we found a bird nature is always
[08:46:42] accompanied by predation and
[08:46:44] sacrifice its antithesis is known as
[08:46:48] order that is what I want to do unite
[08:46:52] people's happiness under the banner of
[08:46:55] order they won't need to make bitter
[08:46:58] choices any longer nor face the
[08:47:00] weaknesses of
[08:47:02] humanity they can cast aside their
[08:47:04] Primal instincts to build a Haven for
[08:47:10] mankind simply describing thoughts as
[08:47:13] far too abstract okay so allow me to
[08:47:16] provide a simple example simple example
[08:47:18] okay as you all may know there are
[08:47:20] societal Norms like weekends and long
[08:47:24] weekend yes on some worlds during these
[08:47:28] hard earned rest days people are given
[08:47:31] the chance to extricate themselves from
[08:47:33] the stresses of everyday life yeah
[08:47:36] allowing a certain Tranquility to return
[08:47:38] to their souls Sunday is a weekend and
[08:47:41] it is only on these days that people do
[08:47:44] not have to adhere to the law where the
[08:47:46] strong prey on the
[08:47:48] weak they can live out their lives
[08:47:50] happily during these brief
[08:47:53] intermissions it's just a Pity that two
[08:47:57] or 3 days are still too fleeting
[08:47:59] compared to the span of a
[08:48:03] lifetime from where I stand society's
[08:48:06] ideal system should be seven rest days
[08:48:10] following Sunday there should ensue a
[08:48:13] okay I mean kind of Bas a third and
[08:48:15] indeed an infinite procession of
[08:48:18] Sundays this should be the face of the
[08:48:20] new world idilic Eternal peace ful days
[08:48:25] uh someone once said uh there's a quote
[08:48:28] that goes you don't hate Mondays you
[08:48:29] hate capitalism is this what Sunday's
[08:48:31] trying to
[08:48:33] say and thus every person can return to
[08:48:37] their base selves in this I can't see
[08:48:39] the text hello some gaze in reverence at
[08:48:42] the stars pouring their whole beings
[08:48:44] into calculating the distance between us
[08:48:47] and the isolated world of
[08:48:49] pagana meanwhile some seek refuge in
[08:48:52] quiet Corners holding one one another
[08:48:55] unencumbered by the chains of unwelcome
[08:48:59] obligations there would be no need to
[08:49:01] Bear the hardships of
[08:49:03] reality only in this way can Humanity
[08:49:07] face the inevitable end with the purest
[08:49:10] of
[08:49:11] spirit living a life of
[08:49:15] dignity this is what it is to live in
[08:49:19] Bliss Miss
[08:49:21] Firefly you who are stricken with
[08:49:24] entropy lost
[08:49:25] syndrome you of all would surely
[08:49:28] understand this herass is not
[08:49:35] listening it sounds like a Flawless
[08:49:40] Theory but that's
[08:49:44] just
[08:49:46] but what is the price to attain all
[08:49:51] this the cost is minute merely a
[08:49:55] personal and eternal
[08:49:58] sacrifice if this paradise is to be
[08:50:00] maintained for everyone someone must
[08:50:03] remain trapped in solitary wakening
[08:50:06] until the end of the
[08:50:10] cosmos
[08:50:13] Awakening which means that this socalled
[08:50:16] paradise is still a dream stepping into
[08:50:19] this paradise means forsaking reality
[08:50:22] correct
[08:50:27] it is not forsaking but
[08:50:29] transcending Flesh Blood sorrow this guy
[08:50:33] talk too much if the physical is
[08:50:36] spiritual suffering it is only logical
[08:50:39] that we defeat
[08:50:41] it but in this supposed Bliss people
[08:50:45] won't have defeated their
[08:50:46] demons the chance to overcome their
[08:50:49] tribulations would be forever lost to
[08:50:52] them in other words
[08:50:55] it is an
[08:50:56] escape that's understanding it but there
[08:51:01] is no shame in escape on the contrary
[08:51:05] the seeds of Escape exist in everyone's
[08:51:07] Hearts don't you agree Miss
[08:51:10] Firefly and as to why we sleep it is
[08:51:14] because we are afraid to awaken from our
[08:51:18] dreams but this is not in conflict with
[08:51:20] the grand
[08:51:21] plan only in acknowledging this can we
[08:51:25] truly understand the Frailty of human
[08:51:28] nature and from there show compassion
[08:51:31] and
[08:51:34] protection
[08:51:37] I I admit that you are a born
[08:51:42] leader your perspective on Humanity
[08:51:44] brims with
[08:51:47] pessimism yet you express compassion for
[08:51:51] all even when your heart pies them wait
[08:51:55] wait wait wait wait what's up
[08:51:58] just okay I'm
[08:52:08] live one sec
[08:52:33] [Music]
[08:52:45] but unlike
[08:52:47] you I live for the
[08:52:50] self from my perspective individuals
[08:52:55] choices for themselves is their
[08:52:58] Birthright the want to escape may be
[08:53:01] innate in the
[08:53:02] weak but whether they are weak or
[08:53:06] not it is not up to another to
[08:53:10] decide perhaps in your
[08:53:13] mind you also view me as
[08:53:21] weak because I don't don't think
[08:53:26] so true as Miss Firefly has said her
[08:53:29] peace the astral Express will also
[08:53:32] naturally give you our
[08:53:36] answer we'll leave it to you just as Mr
[08:53:39] Mel instructed before tell him our
[08:53:48] choice what
[08:53:52] the one second what is this place oh
[08:53:57] [ __ ] Misha does this place ring any
[08:53:59] bells
[08:54:00] Misha I I don't know but I feel a sense
[08:54:06] of deja vu what is this
[08:54:12] place oh you're fine uh I turn it
[08:54:16] [Music]
[08:54:18] off thing okay no you're good I just
[08:54:20] don't want to like show you on love you
[08:54:29] [Music]
[08:54:38] okay it's the realm within a dream
[08:54:41] bubble this was left to the astral
[08:54:43] Express by a nameless but weirdly when
[08:54:46] we entered it it was completely empty
[08:54:49] the cab is tilted where is it
[08:54:51] [Music]
[08:54:55] is
[08:55:01] it please turn it back off looks fine
[08:55:04] okay Dr Edward from the Dreamscape sales
[08:55:07] store told me that dreams are formed
[08:55:10] from memories and a dream bubble anyway
[08:55:13] hi Misha you going to learn Misha I saw
[08:55:16] I I I'm like pretty spoiler free no
[08:55:19] spoilers I just saw that Misha was
[08:55:21] trending on Twitter like a while ago so
[08:55:23] I assume there's there's stuff
[08:55:26] so I thought you might be able to help
[08:55:29] us in unraveling this mystery me unravel
[08:55:34] she
[08:55:36] us among us too well that's a combo I
[08:55:39] don't know much about dream bubbles but
[08:55:42] if you want to figure out what this
[08:55:44] Mansion is I'll do my best I'm counting
[08:55:48] on you
[08:55:49] then all right heo I still don't get it
[08:55:53] why were you so sure that Misha had a
[08:55:55] connection with this dream bubble no
[08:55:58] wrong voice I'm sorry I'm sorry I meant
[08:55:59] to do I'll stop I ruined it I wasn't
[08:56:03] sure it was just a hunch but since Misha
[08:56:07] feels familiar with this place my hunch
[08:56:11] might be correct so true this place
[08:56:13] looks a bit familiar I remember this
[08:56:16] place exactly this is where you and
[08:56:19] Firefly encountered death which we now
[08:56:22] know as dormancy
[08:56:24] considering its connection to dreamlux
[08:56:26] Reef it's not surprising it appeared
[08:56:29] here the question now is who brought you
[08:56:32] here based on the clues we have so far
[08:56:36] it's unlikely to be that masked fool
[08:56:38] we're drawing closer to the truth once
[08:56:40] more let's give Misha some time let's
[08:56:41] give Misha some time as I believe he'll
[08:56:44] unveil the secret of the dream bubble
[08:56:47] all right but there are doors all over
[08:56:50] the place which one should we choose
[08:56:55] H I
[08:56:57] guess maybe this
[08:57:00] way okay sure thing M uh I'm not
[08:57:03] entirely sure but let's give it a
[08:57:10] try wait you managed to choose the right
[08:57:14] door that was on point dude I'm telling
[08:57:15] you I'm telling you this place is quite
[08:57:19] different from the
[08:57:21] hotel but I just I feel like I've been
[08:57:25] here before
[08:57:27] and even lived here for a while if I
[08:57:31] remember correctly there should be a
[08:57:34] fireplace down that hallway Clocky and I
[08:57:38] used to sit by the fire listening to the
[08:57:41] crackling of
[08:57:42] firewood and and the room on the other
[08:57:46] side was the toy room okay I loved
[08:57:50] spreading out all the toys from the Box
[08:57:52] on the floor
[08:57:54] making up stories for each of them
[08:57:57] hold this doesn't make sense didn't I
[08:58:02] grew up in dreamlux Reef
[08:58:05] so what is this place this could be a
[08:58:09] case of
[08:58:10] Amnesia don't worry Misha it's common
[08:58:13] for everyone to forget certain aspects
[08:58:15] of the past those memories haven't
[08:58:18] vanished they're just lying in the
[08:58:20] depths of your mind since this place
[08:58:23] seems familiar to you why don't we
[08:58:26] explore a few more rooms and see if you
[08:58:28] can recall anything more yeah then let's
[08:58:32] check out the rooms
[08:58:40] I Tick Tock oh no not Tik
[08:58:44] Tok I beep beep beep noises from the
[08:58:49] room origami bird you and origami bird
[08:58:53] are friends
[08:58:55] yeah it's a member of the compass crew
[08:58:58] just like clarky and Miss mirror and
[08:59:01] there's more than just one origami bird
[08:59:03] they follow Miss mirror's orders and
[08:59:05] handle all sorts of jobs on the ship
[08:59:07] they're the best
[08:59:14] Sailors could you tell us more about the
[08:59:16] compass
[08:59:17] Misha the compass is a ship Bound for
[08:59:20] the new world Clocky and his Partners
[08:59:23] travel through layers of fog to the
[08:59:25] depths of the sea Whenever there is
[08:59:28] danger kaky will use a compass and guide
[08:59:31] the ship in the right direction that's a
[08:59:33] great story but in the pentacon cartoon
[08:59:37] Clocky and his Partners have always
[08:59:39] lived in dreamville and never ventured
[08:59:42] out huh oh that does seem something
[08:59:47] doesn't add up
[08:59:48] weird I I clearly
[08:59:52] remember clock he arrived in the new
[08:59:55] world in the end perhaps Clocky has a
[08:59:58] hidden
[09:00:00] past so where has Clocky
[09:00:03] gone did he it will protect you from
[09:00:07] harm just like they did with
[09:00:13] Clocky H
[09:00:16] okay something very
[09:00:19] important h
[09:00:35] M that's the name now we all know him as
[09:00:38] the watchmaker is that your dad Misha so
[09:00:42] who is he talking to do you know
[09:00:45] anything about it Misha I'm sorry I
[09:00:47] don't know much about the watch maker
[09:00:50] but M anything special about about that
[09:00:54] name Mel oh is okay well close I
[09:00:57] basically knew it his Grandpa's
[09:01:00] name
[09:01:02] [Music]
[09:01:04] okay
[09:01:07] Grandpa do you mean you're the
[09:01:10] watchmaker's grandson but we haven't
[09:01:13] heard anything about the watch maker
[09:01:15] having
[09:01:17] descendants and the name m is not rare
[09:01:20] yeah perhaps it's merely a coincidence
[09:01:23] also isn't M and Misha the same name
[09:01:25] more about your grandpa M yeah sure he
[09:01:29] was a Seafair who fearlessly ventured
[09:01:31] into mysterious seas and storms he was
[09:01:35] always on the sea and had lots of
[09:01:37] friends who accompanied him on his
[09:01:42] travels he didn't want me to call him
[09:01:45] Grandpa because that would make him
[09:01:47] sound old he believed he was still young
[09:01:51] the name Mel was given to him by his
[09:01:53] parents Mahal and
[09:01:55] Elise renowned
[09:01:58] [Music]
[09:02:01] seafarers chat El leise would or
[09:02:14] no would you pull or not pull
[09:02:22] [Music]
[09:02:27] absolutely not what do you mean
[09:02:28] absolutely not have you seen her do you
[09:02:31] have
[09:02:32] eyes every time he came back he'd share
[09:02:35] his log book with me and tell me about
[09:02:37] his adventures at
[09:02:40] Sea I want to become a great adventure
[09:02:43] just like
[09:02:44] him it appears that the seaf farer has
[09:02:47] nothing to do with the watch maker so
[09:02:50] perhaps it's just a coincidence so where
[09:02:53] is your your Grandpa now he went off on
[09:02:56] a New Journey and it's been quite a
[09:03:00] while you don't have to you don't have
[09:03:03] to time out the first time Chatters it's
[09:03:07] okay drama frogs are bound to happen

[09:05:04] with
[09:05:05] the people already did that 100 times oh
[09:05:09] wait but the quest just came out today
[09:05:10] how did people already do it it just
[09:05:12] came
[09:05:13] [Music]
[09:05:18] out look there it
[09:05:22] is the water resembles a precious Jewel
[09:05:26] every time I gaze at the shimmering
[09:05:28] lights beneath the waves it feels a you
[09:05:31] look at the quest description okay I can
[09:05:33] check standing by your
[09:05:36] side have you recalled anything Misha
[09:05:39] yeah I saw these sentences in Grandpa's
[09:05:43] log book he used to say that despite the
[09:05:46] Perils of the sea whenever he stood on
[09:05:49] the deck in the afternoon overlooking
[09:05:52] the sparkling waves
[09:05:54] he would think of this fountain in front
[09:05:56] of his house he often said that those
[09:05:58] moments felt like returning to his
[09:06:00] family's side and the difficulties at
[09:06:03] Sea didn't seem quite as
[09:06:06] challenging you know I quite understand
[09:06:09] such
[09:06:10] sentiments don't s I'll start getting
[09:06:12] great hair you're talking like an
[09:06:15] elder hey not an elder perhaps every
[09:06:20] Adventurer far from home carries a
[09:06:22] fountain with in their soul even though
[09:06:25] the other side of the sea remains
[09:06:27] shrouded in the unknown the fountain in
[09:06:30] front of his house serves as a compass
[09:06:33] leading him back to his cherished ones
[09:06:36] yeah while Grandpa was at home we would
[09:06:39] stand by The Fountain and place the
[09:06:42] compass a toy boat that I made into the
[09:06:46] pool back then I would ask him when I
[09:06:48] could go on adventures like him and he
[09:06:51] would always like wait his [ __ ] eyes
[09:06:52] is literally a hole it's a key
[09:06:55] keyhole It seems this taale is truly a
[09:06:58] seaer and has nothing to do with the
[09:07:01] watch maker yeah based on Misha's
[09:07:05] Recollections the scenes in the dream
[09:07:07] bubble appear to be but this raises more
[09:07:10] questions according to Misha he was
[09:07:13] clearly born on an oceanic Planet could
[09:07:16] this be some sort of
[09:07:19] metaphor perhaps the ca refers to the
[09:07:22] memory Zone
[09:07:24] I'm
[09:07:26] sorry I don't know but my memories keep
[09:07:30] pouring out
[09:07:31] uncontrollably is mar cooking water
[09:07:34] flowing from a fountain perhaps I'll
[09:07:41] I'll we're going to the opposite side
[09:07:45] right no wait can I get past this left
[09:07:49] here no what if I jump sorry I don't
[09:07:52] know why I made that joke sorry sorry
[09:07:53] sorry sorry sorry what's this a
[09:07:57] hand okay huh something feels feel like
[09:08:01] there's a chest here different about
[09:08:03] this
[09:08:04] place this is it I remember this
[09:08:13] Corridor I want to go
[09:08:15] too up ahead
[09:08:18] is Grandpa's
[09:08:20] study sa it was in that room that I saw
[09:08:26] him the last
[09:08:30] time tick tick
[09:08:36] tick
[09:08:44] huh the atmosphere in this room feels
[09:08:47] totally different Misha you finally come
[09:08:53] luy you're
[09:08:56] here are those books on the bookshelf
[09:08:59] log books left behind by that seaf farer
[09:09:03] yeah whenever he came back he placed a
[09:09:07] log book on the bookshelf in his room so
[09:09:09] he's a cartographer like M contain
[09:09:11] records of his expeditions to every
[09:09:14] corner of the world he described our
[09:09:17] world as a fountain to ensure that
[09:09:20] everyone had land to settle on he had to
[09:09:23] continue exploring the sea and search
[09:09:26] for the in months sea on that day he
[09:09:32] called me to his study telling me that
[09:09:35] he was embarking on another journey I
[09:09:38] asked him if I could go with him but he
[09:09:42] said that my adventure lay
[09:09:44] elsewhere and told me to stay
[09:09:46] home and patiently await a certain sound
[09:09:50] at the door what sound he told me about
[09:09:54] a vast ocean in the
[09:09:57] sky an ocean of
[09:10:00] stars he spoke of a train that
[09:10:03] transports children with a desire to
[09:10:05] venture far away the magical School Bus
[09:10:08] traversing the Sea of stars without ever
[09:10:11] stopping he said that he knew the crew
[09:10:15] on the train oh and that he had asked
[09:10:19] them to take me along wait that's us he
[09:10:22] said the journey I had always dreamed
[09:10:25] of what start there a train could it be
[09:10:30] it's oh [ __ ] the astral
[09:10:32] Express I I remember now Grandpa's
[09:10:37] friends are a group of n came to this
[09:10:39] world to resolve a disaster caus I just
[09:10:42] realized something but I don't want to
[09:10:43] say it then he gave his pocket watch to
[09:10:47] me it was his cherish's treasure
[09:10:51] appearing in every one of his Advent
[09:10:53] Tales it basically he's basically saying
[09:10:56] that like he's going to join the astral
[09:10:57] Express but I haven't seen Misha in the
[09:10:59] astral Express in like any piece of
[09:11:01] media so that probably means he's going
[09:11:03] to die he said as long as I kept moving
[09:11:08] forward I'd eventually reach my desired
[09:11:12] destination and then no no you're going
[09:11:13] to join don't worry the distant sound of
[09:11:16] a train
[09:11:17] whistle heckling throughout the
[09:11:21] room cuz I feel like in the 4.3
[09:11:24] that whistle didn't we
[09:11:27] yeah I think I can still find the
[09:11:31] way maybe he's the janitor true this is
[09:11:35] the dream do you remember looks like
[09:11:37] we're
[09:11:38] just I'm I'm the best at this watch
[09:11:41] never mind
[09:11:42] watch the
[09:11:46] [Music]
[09:11:51] a 4 3 question mark no like the 4.3
[09:11:54] preview stream didn't have like Misha in
[09:11:56] the express being like Oh I'm Misha of
[09:11:59] the
[09:12:01] astr
[09:12:02] this is my room of clocks wait he's the
[09:12:05] clock master I spent my time waiting for
[09:12:07] Grandpa to return from his voyage Walter
[09:12:11] gave me this Workshop oh 2.3 my bad my
[09:12:14] bad my bad 2.3 my bad here I learned how
[09:12:18] to repair Clockwork in Gears out of my
[09:12:21] fondness to Precision mechanics
[09:12:25] in my
[09:12:26] dreams I was the captain of the compass
[09:12:30] I I was born and raised here so this
[09:12:35] building in the dream bubble is your
[09:12:38] childhood home yes this dream bubble
[09:12:42] itself is my
[09:12:45] home looks like you've remembered
[09:12:47] everything now wait wait why does it
[09:12:50] feel like everyone else knows something
[09:12:52] I don't
[09:12:59] March do you remember when she mentioned
[09:13:02] the Clocky that only she could
[09:13:05] see yeah the little guy here right but
[09:13:09] we all saw him in dreamlux Reef right
[09:13:13] and Mr Yang even greeted him looks like
[09:13:17] everyone on the astral Express has a
[09:13:19] childlike Spirit the answer lies in the
[09:13:22] astral Express
[09:13:23] her experience shows that neither
[09:13:25] Firefly nor acaron can see this Clocky
[09:13:29] and when we were in dreamlux Reef you
[09:13:31] may have noticed that for some reason
[09:13:34] nobody outside of the crew had ever
[09:13:36] talked with
[09:13:37] Clocky wait
[09:13:41] really a mimic life that can only be
[09:13:44] seen by a select few it's just like a
[09:13:47] hidden message wait a second by someone
[09:13:50] for the name wait a second it was but
[09:13:53] Misha can see Clocky too right they even
[09:13:56] grew up that's what m left for us but
[09:13:58] Misha hasn't started the way of the
[09:14:00] trailblaze yet that's the key to the
[09:14:03] mystery March now take a moment to
[09:14:06] recall have you ever seen any I thought
[09:14:09] I thought I thought I thought the kids
[09:14:10] could see it couldn't the kids see it
[09:14:14] wait no way that's the answer March
[09:14:19] 7th this dream bubble is the place where
[09:14:22] I was born
[09:14:24] and
[09:14:25] I I'm a dweller in this
[09:14:28] dream just like a memory Zone
[09:14:31] meme I should have stayed here and
[09:14:34] waited for you but when reality and
[09:14:37] memories
[09:14:38] merged I unconsciously pushed open that
[09:14:41] door and left the bubble with Clocky
[09:14:44] what the hell so it's not that the
[09:14:47] watchmaker's dream bubble is empty but
[09:14:51] rather the stuff inside died ran
[09:14:54] away and the whistle you heard was the
[09:14:57] sound of the express arriving at
[09:14:59] pentacon that's one way to see it but I
[09:15:02] believe there's a longer story behind
[09:15:05] all this it's best for Misha himself to
[09:15:08] explain all the is going to be like see
[09:15:10] when I was younger there was a bird with
[09:15:12] your name now should we call you Misha
[09:15:15] or Mel thank you all for helping me
[09:15:19] ReDiscover my true self now
[09:15:23] please allow me to reintroduce
[09:15:26] myself I was born on laka in the prir
[09:15:30] system adopted by seafarers Mel and
[09:15:35] Char they gave me a
[09:15:37] treasure a name that carried their
[09:15:44] hopes male Char lward wa I knew it I
[09:15:48] called this like 2.0 Misha sorry wait
[09:15:52] but literally literally 2.0 cuz I was
[09:15:54] like Mel and Misha are the same
[09:15:59] [Music]
[09:16:01] name if you prefer you can call me by a
[09:16:04] more familiar name the watchmaker so
[09:16:09] you're the watch maker himself
[09:16:13] unfortunately that legendary
[09:16:17] figure it's no
[09:16:19] more I am only a reflection of his life
[09:16:23] as for the child who has been with you
[09:16:26] he's the innocent protagonist of Misha's
[09:16:29] childhood
[09:16:31] dream friend of
[09:16:33] Clocky a Young
[09:16:36] Apprentice and a future mechanic wait is
[09:16:39] this finina falor
[09:16:41] no kind of not really I mean they kind
[09:16:43] of look like
[09:16:47] finina no okay sorry sorry sorry I
[09:16:50] overcooked sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
[09:16:52] sorry sorry no just cuz you know Fino is
[09:16:54] like innocent falor no
[09:16:58] okay and this also marks the beginning
[09:17:01] of his journey devoted to the trail oh
[09:17:04] [ __ ] I overcooked I ruined it at the end
[09:17:06] of the
[09:17:07] journey I left this little
[09:17:10] flame which I so
[09:17:13] cherished in my deepest
[09:17:16] dreams hoping to pass it on to the
[09:17:19] nameless of future Generations
[09:17:23] however he somehow left the dream bubble
[09:17:27] and forgot all about his
[09:17:29] task I apologize for all the confusion
[09:17:33] this
[09:17:35] caus because he was born with a desire
[09:17:38] to trailblaze wasn't
[09:17:40] he I don't think Misha has forgotten his
[09:17:43] role as a guide he remembered it and
[09:17:46] that's why he mistakenly appeared as a
[09:17:48] hotel doorman in Her Dream from the very
[09:17:50] beginning the one who brought our UNC
[09:17:52] conscious friend here must have been
[09:17:54] Misha if that's the case we encountered
[09:17:57] the watchmaker's Legacy from the
[09:17:59] beginning didn't we well I have a
[09:18:03] sarcastic friend who says I always take
[09:18:05] big detours and end up back where I
[09:18:08] started perhaps that's what every namess
[09:18:11] has to go
[09:18:13] through but in the end you found
[09:18:17] me I'm sure you're all wondering what my
[09:18:20] legacy
[09:18:21] is I believe my has mentioned the
[09:18:23] stellon and my
[09:18:25] wealth if I may
[09:18:28] apologize the stellon part is
[09:18:31] real as for my wealth however it's
[09:18:35] nothing more than a baseless
[09:18:37] rumor I left my homeland as a child and
[09:18:41] embarked on the Journey of trail
[09:18:44] blaz I traveled to various
[09:18:48] planets until finally reaching
[09:18:51] asdon where my my friends and I built
[09:18:53] the original
[09:18:55] pentacon and fought for its future ever
[09:18:59] since I've been moving forward all my
[09:19:03] life doing what I could to overcome the
[09:19:06] obstacles in my
[09:19:08] path but
[09:19:10] ultimately my journey reached its end
[09:19:13] huh and I left behind no possessions
[09:19:16] worth in trusting so if you ask what's
[09:19:20] left within this worn out engine that
[09:19:23] can be called a
[09:19:25] legacy I suppose it's the things that
[09:19:28] are still I'm sorry sorry burning in the
[09:19:30] Eng
[09:19:31] furnace now that you're well aware of
[09:19:33] the current situation of
[09:19:36] pentacon I certainly hope that you'll
[09:19:38] help me get this world back on
[09:19:40] track but I'll leave that decision to
[09:19:43] you for the path of
[09:19:46] trailblaze is never paved by others all
[09:19:50] I have for you is a story
[09:19:53] and two

[09:27:28] special pocket watch in my
[09:27:31] memories it was with my
[09:27:34] grandpa guiding him on his sea

[09:27:41] adventure story I wanted to have a
[09:27:45] pocket watch like that

[09:27:52] dreams it sounded like he like aged down
[09:27:56] like like became like 50 years younger
[09:27:58] when he said that he's like and that's
[09:28:02] when you appeared

[09:30:23] might learn about life itself and
[09:30:24] everything within however the more I
[09:30:26] learned the more I found out I found
[09:30:27] myself lost in confusion and distress I
[09:30:30] thought that I would be able to learn
[09:30:31] how to live a better life but all I
[09:30:32] Learned was how to elegantly face the

[09:31:42] own ending there may be there are many
[09:31:44] things that people are capable of and
[09:31:46] our endings will thus take

[09:32:26] to our own ending there are many things
[09:32:28] that people are capable of and our
[09:32:29] ending will thus take on a completely
[09:32:31] new meaning a nameless does not indulge
[09:32:32] in temporary dreams nor would they
[09:32:34] forsake their birth rights due to pain
[09:32:35] and suffering do you still recall the
[09:32:38] question I left in my invitation letter

[09:32:49] nameless devoted his higher life to
[09:32:57] finding
[09:33:01] [Music]

[09:33:37] is where it
[09:33:39] [Music]
[09:33:41] ends what do you mean Misha you told me
[09:33:45] that the trailblazing Expedition would
[09:33:48] never end

[09:33:54] said so now it's up to you to decide
[09:33:58] your next destination my next
[09:34:03] destination what's that supposed to
[09:34:05] Misha you're acting weird
[09:34:09] today if you're feeling
[09:34:12] down no I I'm not feeling down as for
[09:34:18] Clockwork yeah it resolves all problem
[09:34:21] problems in this
[09:34:24] dream so do you know what Clockwork
[09:34:28] actually is
[09:34:31] H I'm not quite
[09:34:35] sure well everyone gets lost at times
[09:34:40] they may hesitate and doubt which way to
[09:34:42] go that happens in this Dreamscape and
[09:34:46] Beyond but don't worry everyone goes
[09:34:50] through moments of uncertain in
[09:34:52] hesitation
[09:34:54] eventually they gather the courage to
[09:34:56] make bold decisions whether it's calming
[09:35:01] joyful angry or or
[09:35:04] sad all they need is a little nudge to
[09:35:07] take that step toward where they truly
[09:35:10] belong I
[09:35:14] mean the little n i mean you're
[09:35:16] literally mind controlling them to be
[09:35:18] happy I don't know about little nudge
[09:35:19] but and I hope you'll share with others
[09:35:23] okay such is the essence of clockwork
[09:35:26] the will of the
[09:35:32] trailblaze oh clock's hands spin around
[09:35:36] nonstop s indicating confusion
[09:35:40] frustration and
[09:35:42] weakness but wa that's our hat I'm not
[09:35:45] supposed to know that yet okay never

[09:36:07] Force war and venturing even
[09:36:11] further what if what if Mel is is what
[09:36:14] if he is pi does not belong to
[09:36:17] [Music]
[09:36:18] order who the [ __ ] is
[09:36:30] I can't believe that Eon would cast a
[09:36:33] glance at penone at a time like
[09:36:35] this is it because of the resonance from
[09:36:38] the legacy of the trail place and she
[09:36:40] pays or perhaps the bond between you is
[09:36:44] so strong that it even impresses an
[09:36:48] eon well there might be another
[09:36:51] possibility
[09:36:52] perhaps they want to witness on behalf
[09:36:54] of the Fallen eons who will hold the
[09:36:57] future of
[09:37:00] penacon if that's the case on behalf of

[09:41:52] you're not getting away with it I'm
[09:41:53] clipping this no no I saw some [ __ ] one
[09:41:55] second of the won't be a big deal I saw
[09:41:58] some [ __ ] that makes G to want to look
[09:41:59] like a saint one second
[09:42:02] why this other voice line
[09:42:05] says I flexed on him too hard with my
[09:42:08] Peak swag guess I messed around and
[09:42:11] found out huh
[09:42:18] [Music]
[09:42:23] I'm sorry bad like I'm trying to defend
[09:42:25] you
[09:42:27] but fate
[09:42:32] b anyway we can't leave the stellon
[09:42:36] unchecked this is about trailblazing a
[09:42:39] bright future for pentacon and
[09:42:41] fulfilling male's and his predecessors
[09:42:43] long cherished
[09:42:45] wishes now that we've taken up the
[09:42:47] mantle we can't afford to fail them
[09:42:51] however the same applies to the
[09:42:54] order their plan didn't materialize
[09:42:58] overnight and they have the profound
[09:43:00] Collective consciousness of the planet
[09:43:02] of festivities behind them a desire to
[09:43:05] dream to Slumber and Escape
[09:43:10] reality all those hidden emotions have
[09:43:12] given birth to the sweet dream of the
[09:43:14] order they've harnessed the will of an
[09:43:17] entire planet to create an eon true this
[09:43:22] confrontation is far more complicated
[09:43:25] than a simple power
[09:43:26] struggle to secure penton's
[09:43:30] future fighting on the stage alone is
[09:43:33] not enough what do you mean are you not
[09:43:37] coming with us I believe Firefly is
[09:43:40] trying to say that
[09:43:45] mhm before I
[09:43:47] left the destiny slave told me that this
[09:43:50] journey would bring Unforgettable
[09:43:54] rewards even though the script he gave
[09:43:56] me only had a few lines I couldn't
[09:43:58] ignore them because one of the lines
[09:44:02] said I experience death three times in
[09:44:07] the land of the dreams three
[09:44:11] times this can't be serious he March
[09:44:13] also has one earring only the first time
[09:44:17] was a painful death when I was stabbed
[09:44:20] by the blade of dorm
[09:44:22] which led to all subsequent events
[09:44:24] Firefly only has stuff on the one side
[09:44:26] of her head the script will always come
[09:44:30] true
[09:44:32] but in a way that will only be revealed
[09:44:35] when that page is
[09:44:36] turned so now I've understood the
[09:44:39] meaning of my second
[09:44:44] death and I am prepared to face
[09:44:48] it if all go
[09:44:51] my efforts will provide crucial support
[09:44:53] for
[09:44:54] you only by achieving victory in this
[09:44:57] battle can we secure a future for
[09:45:02] pentacon and only
[09:45:05] then my third and final
[09:45:09] death yeah Firefly pauses way longer
[09:45:12] than other characters I don't know if
[09:45:13] it's on purpose or not but it's the most
[09:45:15] terrible
[09:45:17] form does that mean the true
[09:45:21] death where everyone in pentacon loses
[09:45:24] themsel completely in the Eternal sweet
[09:45:27] dream of the
[09:45:29] order we must do everything we can to
[09:45:32] prevent that have you oops I mean to
[09:45:35] click otherwise I wouldn't be here thank
[09:45:38] you again for your assistance for the
[09:45:40] astral Express may we meet again in
[09:45:45] reality

[09:46:11] earth it bloomed in the morning
[09:46:14] sun and whispered to me

[09:46:23] flame wait where did her shirt
[09:46:26] go may we meet again in
[09:46:35] reality did s today jaella name will
[09:46:38] disappear from cosmic history and the
[09:46:41] everflame Mansion will take its

[09:46:56] dreams pentacon I hope you find whatever
[09:47:01] you seek there be it
[09:47:04] answers or
[09:47:07] salvation you mean my three deaths
[09:47:12] silverwolf told me about
[09:47:14] it it's such a shame that it's not part
[09:47:17] of my script well I want to live
[09:47:22] I'm never afraid of death
[09:47:26] dude of death is eternal life and
[09:47:31] that's that's something I'll never
[09:47:33] desire the pauses between Firefly is
[09:47:35] like commas like the one part of s the
[09:47:37] next part it's like it's like and now
[09:47:39] Firefly on the scene of the
[09:47:42] action thank you so much we're reporting
[09:47:46] lot people
[09:47:48] die and I am no exception
[09:47:53] sorry death is like a
[09:47:56] script A fate that cannot be
[09:48:01] defied but that's exactly why we have to
[09:48:07] choose where we want to rest from I'm
[09:48:08] not make it's fine she's just on high
[09:48:10] ping it happens it's okay do you exist
[09:48:14] just to perish are you not the same

[09:48:39] to
[09:48:42] sorry if I were to die
[09:48:46] now I would only be a weapon no don't
[09:48:49] die Firefly you will live I
[09:48:54] believe I should die as a
[09:48:57] human though its definition escapes me
[09:49:01] isn't this the answer that ordinary
[09:49:03] people look for their whole
[09:49:05] lives a name that can be carved onto
[09:49:08] their Tombstone okay the tombstone that
[09:49:11] belongs to me once bore the
[09:49:14] inscription glo's iron
[09:49:19] Cavalry then it she doesn't speak to
[09:49:21] slow in other dubs okay someone in my
[09:49:23] chat said it was a bug which is kind of
[09:49:24] why I've been [ __ ] posting but if it if
[09:49:26] it's intentional it's intentional so I
[09:49:28] can't tell if it's a bug then I'm making
[09:49:30] fun of it if it's not then my bad I
[09:49:32] don't [ __ ] know I mean I don't care
[09:49:34] that much but it will bear the name
[09:49:38] Firefly and all the Brilliance she
[09:49:41] showed at the end of her
[09:49:46] life I'm auto play
[09:49:48] sorry okay
[09:49:55] that's quite unexpected old
[09:49:58] man who would have thought your crazy
[09:50:01] plan would actually
[09:50:04] work do all you nameless fools just act
[09:50:07] on a whim okay Gallagher's also talking
[09:50:10] so though my bad maybe my brain is
[09:50:12] rotted to an
[09:50:13] end the nameless may be young oh [ __ ]
[09:50:17] they had the ability to achieve this
[09:50:19] goal
[09:50:20] just like you did in your
[09:50:26] time it's a shame you won't be able to
[09:50:28] see it
[09:50:30] firstand maybe I won't
[09:50:33] either once something fictional is seen
[09:50:36] through ceases to
[09:50:38] exist yeah not just those
[09:50:41] nameless even Mr Wings is just like
[09:50:45] you
[09:50:46] stubborn won't listen or give up no
[09:50:49] matter what
[09:50:52] well fate is unpredictable I
[09:50:56] guess if we weren't Bound by those
[09:50:58] cursed
[09:51:00] paths maybe we could have had some good
[09:51:02] talks but in the end we managed to do
[09:51:06] it now we can find
[09:51:10] Solace remember how those idiots cursed
[09:51:13] us they it go to hell you worthless
[09:51:17] traitors well I don't know if they
[09:51:20] really meant it
[09:51:22] but if Longing For Freedom means going
[09:51:24] to hell then I'll be joining you soon
[09:51:27] you
[09:51:30] fool let's get together and have supper
[09:51:32] again in
[09:51:35] hell oh I almost forgot there's one more
[09:51:39] thing here's to you a glass of hello and
[09:51:43] goodbye Trail Blazer to the
[09:51:47] imperfect tomorrow what are you doing
[09:51:50] gallager
[09:51:54] it's warm here isn't
[09:51:57] it you're lucky to have found Shelter
[09:52:01] From the
[09:52:02] rain let alone fresh berries in
[09:52:07] this desolate
[09:52:11] place I was just following the scent of
[09:52:14] life it's particularly strong in a place
[09:52:17] like this it's a shame these berries
[09:52:19] don't have much FL
[09:52:21] I thought she was eating like a
[09:52:23] snowball seriously that's a
[09:52:26] berry in case you didn't know this fruit
[09:52:28] is pretty
[09:52:30] juicy the only downside is that when you
[09:52:34] chew it it
[09:52:36] becomes
[09:52:38] extremely
[09:52:40] spicy
[09:52:42] okay have you lost your sense of taste
[09:52:50] I can still taste certain things like a
[09:52:54] faint
[09:52:55] sweetness nice and spicy I didn't
[09:52:58] process that before coming here I
[09:52:59] stopped by a place called orcon it had
[09:53:02] Barren Cliffs and nights lit by
[09:53:05] bonfires burgundy snow would fall from
[09:53:07] the sky and when it landed on my tongue
[09:53:10] it tasted like raspberries the flavor
[09:53:13] wasn't exactly sweet but it left a
[09:53:16] lasting
[09:53:18] impression when I think back on my past
[09:53:20] I realized that what's tying everything
[09:53:23] together isn't the big events but rather
[09:53:27] these small Unforgettable moments don't
[09:53:30] worry about it losing oneself is a
[09:53:33] reality that every self- Annihilator
[09:53:35] must
[09:53:36] face at least I haven't completely lost
[09:53:39] my senses and memories yet well
[09:53:42] congratulations on adding another
[09:53:44] footnote to your journey by the way are
[09:53:48] you always alone
[09:53:51] I mean there's Black Swan no no I had a
[09:53:52] companion in orron never mind she's a
[09:53:55] short nameless girl who aspired to
[09:53:56] explore ex she always said she'd walk a
[09:54:00] path deeper and farther than
[09:54:05] aavil quite an ambition for such a small
[09:54:08] girl
[09:54:09] who so what what
[09:54:15] happened
[09:54:17] she became stagnant water
[09:54:21] is this a dead hongkai
[09:54:23] character Kiana is Kiana dead thought
[09:54:26] Kiana was alive
[09:54:28] Kiana
[09:54:31] dead in act I I it is revealed that
[09:54:33] Keana is in fact alive I don't know I'm
[09:54:36] spoiling my [ __ ] whatever sorry
[09:54:39] well my spoiler sorry man I'm sorry
[09:54:45] condolences I don't need them the girl
[09:54:48] left with a smile she never never
[09:54:50] regretted her choice and most definitely
[09:54:52] wanted me to say goodbye with a
[09:54:54] smile so that's what I did okay to the
[09:54:59] okay look look look look I didn't mean
[09:55:01] bro this is from a Reddit post that is 4
[09:55:03] years old it's not like this came out
[09:55:06] today sorry sorry
[09:55:12] sorry that's proof that you're grieving
[09:55:15] for
[09:55:18] her or perhaps I'm just
[09:55:22] afraid
[09:55:24] afraid I rarely sense that emotion from
[09:55:28] you what do you fear I'm afraid I'll
[09:55:32] forget the 30 days I spent with her just
[09:55:35] like all the other days in my
[09:55:37] life most of them have already washed
[09:55:40] away with the rain disappearing into an
[09:55:42] unseen
[09:55:43] realm I fear that those Vivid red
[09:55:46] memories will fade away
[09:55:48] too there isn't much color left and
[09:55:52] besides this faint warm red there's
[09:55:55] almost nothing hard to
[09:55:57] imagine a ranger accustomed to Bloodshed
[09:56:02] destru destruction finding warm in red
[09:56:03] color sorry I have experienced this
[09:56:06] warmth many
[09:56:09] times long ago I promised someone that
[09:56:12] I'd bring it to more
[09:56:13] people and that for every remaining
[09:56:16] moment of my life I'd strive
[09:56:19] for A better ending for all as long as
[09:56:23] this red color still lingers I have a
[09:56:26] chance to fulfill that
[09:56:28] promise it represents a burning fire a
[09:56:32] blooming flower the berries in this cave
[09:56:36] and life itself fleeting yet still
[09:56:42] dazzling in the end it will lead me
[09:56:45] Beyond the Horizon of
[09:56:47] existence and on the other side
[09:56:51] I
[09:56:51] will cut off
[09:56:56] nil the one blessed by the sleeping and
[09:57:00] shapeless is considering how to kill
[09:57:04] them that's
[09:57:06] truly pure
[09:57:08] nihility but you're right about one
[09:57:11] thing after spending so much time thanks
[09:57:15] for the long stream you're a great
[09:57:16] streamer thank
[09:57:18] you 10 hour stream when I look at this
[09:57:21] vibrant red
[09:57:24] fire do I realize
[09:57:27] that when will this
[09:57:30] rain ever stop
[09:57:34] perhaps I wait for the Departed of The
[09:57:36] Departed have finally quieted
[09:57:41] down the sky will clear
[09:57:44] up I do weep for them four four hours
[09:57:54] have you heard of a planet named barari
[09:57:57] skandros Don hung it's one of the
[09:58:01] paradise kingdoms under the influence of
[09:58:03] the
[09:58:04] harmony a sought after Wonderland for
[09:58:07] the inhabitants of the dardu major and
[09:58:10] minor
[09:58:11] systems half an Amber era ago the family
[09:58:15] held an unprecedented Festival
[09:58:18] there and after that everyone on the
[09:58:21] planet if you could use like a the
[09:58:24] family do you think the same thing will
[09:58:27] happen on pentacon yes like a pet or how
[09:58:31] else can we explain
[09:58:33] it the family deliberately used the
[09:58:36] watch Maker's invitation to keep all the
[09:58:39] path Striders here but banished the
[09:58:42] emanator of the nihility because of the
[09:58:45] nihility I'm rarely affected by the
[09:58:47] power of other paths but somehow I and
[09:58:50] unconsciously infiltrate
[09:58:52] them maybe that's the risk they're
[09:58:55] trying to avoid I would
[09:58:58] disagree barari skandros is not part of
[09:59:01] the credit system or connected to the
[09:59:03] silver rail it's nothing more than a
[09:59:06] remote civilization sheltered by the
[09:59:08] harmony but if the family messes with
[09:59:10] penacon that would be like declaring war
[09:59:13] on almost half of the factions in the
[09:59:15] cosmos no they
[09:59:18] don't if they truly serve the harmony
[09:59:21] that is what do you mean the path in
[09:59:23] paniconi is
[09:59:25] impure the harmony here has
[09:59:29] impurities do you remember the ancient
[09:59:32] swarm disaster I
[09:59:34] do taser the propagation brought endless
[09:59:38] Havoc to the
[09:59:39] universe and it eventually why do I hear
[09:59:41] someone walking to the left fierce
[09:59:43] battle among all
[09:59:46] eons the [ __ ] is happening
[09:59:53] it's pom
[09:59:55] pom okay sorry two paths lost their eons
[09:59:59] in that war the propagation and the
[10:00:03] order coincidentally their downfall is
[10:00:07] related to a certain Eon sheipe the
[10:00:10] harmony Legend has it that they
[10:00:13] participated in the Crusade against the
[10:00:15] imperator insectorum and devoured Anna
[10:00:18] the order for unknown reason
[10:00:21] holy
[10:00:22] foroni so you're saying that the two
[10:00:26] paths are working behind the scenes but
[10:00:28] I don't see any descendants of the
[10:00:30] propagation in
[10:00:32] penacon could it be that the remnants of
[10:00:35] beyond the sky choir are hiding within
[10:00:38] the family trying to resurrect a fallen
[10:00:42] Eon I can't say for sure but they're
[10:00:45] definitely planning something for the
[10:00:47] Char resurrecting
[10:00:48] eon
[10:00:50] hly now this is getting way too
[10:00:52] complicated is this why you want us to
[10:00:54] leave ason right away are you giving up
[10:00:57] the Charmy Festival will start soon bu
[10:01:00] talks fast one thing that I need to
[10:01:02] confirm no matter what a warp jump is
[10:01:05] the best way to do
[10:01:07] so time is running out I have another
[10:01:15] plan hold on are you thinking of using
[10:01:19] in the Jade Abacus of allying oath
[10:01:23] exactly the assistance from the lau
[10:01:26] Cloud Knights would be enough think it
[10:01:29] over
[10:01:31] carefully you can only use that once in
[10:01:34] your lifetime I have considered it
[10:01:36] thoroughly my companions
[10:01:40] are they're also once in A- lifetime
[10:01:43] Treasures
[10:01:47] a wait a second

[10:02:01] child the nameless is quite the
[10:02:05] Diplomat our secrets have spread like
[10:02:08] wildfire within the
[10:02:10] family an IPC starships are gathering
[10:02:14] towards
[10:02:15] Arana this is a crucial moment for us so
[10:02:21] where is the chosen one who

[10:02:50] brother I I know she doesn't want to
[10:02:53] sing for the order so I'll take her
[10:02:57] place

[10:03:03] years I'm sure you understand the
[10:03:05] consequences of your
[10:03:10] choice if you consider this a
[10:03:14] betrayal well there can't be two sons in
[10:03:17] the sky I'll step up and tell take down
[10:03:20] the other son if necessary

[10:58:10] what do you want from
[10:58:12] me
[10:58:14] nevertheless this is what a trivial blip
[10:58:16] in the annals of Galactic
[10:58:19] history what truly matters is the course
[10:58:22] this River shall take in the days to
[10:58:24] come you've arrived at the perfect
[10:58:27] moment the charmony festival is about to
[10:58:30] commence and it would be a shame if you
[10:58:32] were absent for the Harmony's prologue
[10:58:36] allow me to extend my warmest Ifill was
[10:58:39] here boom one shot one kill Sunday's
[10:58:42] dead Quest over 10 hours ago the very
[10:58:44] core of Aba sorry the abod of the
[10:58:47] stellon the grand stage of the Charmy
[10:58:52] festival and the Very place where the
[10:58:56] future of penacon shall be determined uh
[10:59:00] yeah K you probably don't need both Boot
[10:59:02] and Firefly but if you if you like both
[10:59:04] them I'm sure that's fine like your
[10:59:06] account's not ruined because you want
[10:59:07] two DPSS you could just interchange was
[10:59:12] [Music]
[10:59:13] fine but
[10:59:16] [Music]
[10:59:21] very place where your schemes get
[10:59:22] smashed to
[10:59:24] [Music]
[10:59:27] Smither your unwavering faith in the
[10:59:30] trailblaze is truly
[10:59:32] impressive true goodness can only be
[10:59:35] achieved through
[10:59:38] faith allow me to point out that falling
[10:59:40] into a permanent Slumber is not
[10:59:43] happiness especially when those people
[10:59:45] are driven by someone else's will in
[10:59:47] their
[10:59:49] sleep do you still believe that the
[10:59:51] order only seeks to control the universe
[10:59:53] as their puppet
[10:59:55] heo no matter how perfect your vision of
[10:59:58] paradise may be a cage oh my God the
[11:00:01] bird anology
[11:00:04] again people will never achieve true
[11:00:07] happiness in a world like that they
[11:00:09] would just be toys for the Eon okay
[11:00:11] which Eon though March cuz I've seen
[11:00:13] some of them it seems you have
[11:00:16] misunderstood my
[11:00:18] intentions allow me to
[11:00:21] clarify my desire is not to resurrect a
[11:00:24] fallen Eon or become one
[11:00:30] myself my sole objective is to create a
[11:00:33] paradise free from eons where the order
[11:00:36] ensures the dignity and happiness of all
[11:00:39] Humanity a paradise exclusive to us
[11:00:43] human
[11:00:44] beings that that's not the case if
[11:00:47] people are to live with dignity there
[11:00:49] must be nothing and no one above
[11:00:52] them in your so-called Paradise you
[11:00:55] would be the one reigning
[11:00:59] Supreme looks like we won't be able to
[11:01:02] convince each other now that our
[11:01:04] conflict has been destined let's unveil

[11:16:14] about it
[11:16:15] if it slipped all our minds reckon that
[11:16:18] person was just a minor scoundrel
[11:16:21] unimportant yes when the dust settles
[11:16:25] I'll just think of a way to recall it in
[11:16:28] the memory Zone everyone let's hurry up
[11:16:31] and look for Miss himo shall
[11:16:33] we she's now a minor star on pentacon
[11:16:37] and the entire hotel's concerned about
[11:16:39] her wellbeing you're

[11:17:08] general that's all right in these times
[11:17:11] of conflict for the sake of utmost
[11:17:13] safety it is only right that the
[11:17:15] alliance steps forward to mediate on
[11:17:17] behalf of the Astro Express we must not
[11:17:21] allow you to take unnecessary
[11:17:23] [Music]
[11:17:27] risks yeah that our
[11:17:29] [Music]
[11:17:37] general furthermore despite the ipc's
[11:17:40] eagerness for Success it prioritizes
[11:17:44] peace above all and the family Trap
[11:17:47] though it may be professes a desire for
[11:17:50] harmony the alliance has always want
[11:17:53] people over with reason I firmly believe
[11:17:56] both parties can indeed put aside their
[11:17:58] differences and come to a peaceful
[11:18:01] agreement the general possesses a deep
[11:18:04] understanding of the greater good you
[11:18:06] flatter me but ultimately it's been all
[11:18:09] down to the express well would you look
[11:18:12] at that here comes the Big Hero
[11:18:15] that's
[11:18:17] [Music]
[11:18:19] me let me guess you were thinking about

[11:18:40] jokes on the way here what about you Mr
[11:18:43] Yang I heard that even miss Robin wasn't
[11:18:45] spared and that guy locked you both up
[11:18:49] it's a long story but at least Mr Sund
[11:18:54] from
[11:18:55] YouTube he used an ability called to
[11:18:59] connect our consciousnesses with his in
[11:19:02] other words he imprisoned us within his
[11:19:05] Consciousness thanks to General Jin
[11:19:07] yuen's destruction of the harmonious
[11:19:10] choir we were able to escape he used
[11:19:13] that tuning us I can confidently say now
[11:19:17] he was truly after a fair fight with us
[11:19:21] had he wanted he could have easily taken
[11:19:24] us
[11:19:25] down speaking of the oak family head
[11:19:29] where is he
[11:19:30] now it's complicated but in a
[11:19:33] nutshell he's now the former Oak family
[11:19:36] head huh the IPC has named him the key
[11:19:39] figure in the family's pentacon split
[11:19:42] citing a threat to Cosmic peace
[11:19:45] he must represent the family and answer
[11:19:48] for the unrest caused huh his trial is
[11:19:51] set to take place the family quickly
[11:19:54] labeled him and the remnants of the
[11:19:55] order as enemies declaring the turmoil
[11:19:58] and internal Rebellion everyone really
[11:20:01] has their own agenda after all then
[11:20:04] what's going to happen to miss R I can't
[11:20:06] tell if I'm just overleveled like
[11:20:08] overgeared cuz it didn't it felt like
[11:20:09] the boss fight wasn't done like I feel
[11:20:11] like usually they're harder than that I
[11:20:13] just like boom and died can only say
[11:20:15] that the [ __ ] mobs before Sunday were
[11:20:17] harder girl hello it's time
[11:20:20] everyone the ipc's key members and I
[11:20:23] have agreed to consult one another
[11:20:25] before given the General's invitation
[11:20:27] and the Matter's significance to the
[11:20:29] universe the crew will naturally
[11:20:32] accept however if the IPC has any
[11:20:35] reservations why of course you're
[11:20:36] welcome they've mentioned that your team
[11:20:39] is a trusted Ally besides if there can
[11:20:42] be reliable observers from the astral
[11:20:44] EXP exess present discussions will go
[11:20:47] more
[11:20:48] smoothly I'm kind of allergic to those
[11:20:51] types of
[11:20:52] situations not to worry heo and I won't
[11:20:55] take care of things I'm afraid I'll also
[11:20:58] have to return to the express first the
[11:21:01] conductor is worried about us thank

[11:21:15] one option
[11:21:18] here great although I'm not too sure of
[11:21:21] the reason the representatives from the
[11:21:23] IPC have insisted on her presence allow
[11:21:26] me to lead the way follow me
[11:21:29] please the negotiation will commence at
[11:21:31] the hotel lobby everyone please follow

[11:22:25] my sincere thanks to you general of the
[11:22:27] lau I'm not halfway through we're almost
[11:22:29] done here assures that the talks will
[11:22:31] likely reach a conclusion that satisfies
[11:22:34] all
[11:22:35] sides oh looks like everyone has come
[11:22:38] with expectations of course topaz if you
[11:22:42] please sure leave it to me
[11:22:45] in summary it's good news after much
[11:22:48] deliberation from the Strategic
[11:22:49] investment Department's Council the
[11:22:51] absolute majority of members have agreed
[11:22:54] to the following resolutions in light of
[11:22:57] long-term considerations for interr
[11:22:59] asral peace and by Authority sorry I
[11:23:03] misclicked now that's
[11:23:06] something does that mean eventually took
[11:23:08] a hit for
[11:23:10] nothing well if that's what it takes to
[11:23:13] bring peace to the entire Universe it's
[11:23:15] a price I'll gladly
[11:23:18] pay has the IPC finished sharing all its
[11:23:22] thoughts then it's us I forgot I turned
[11:23:24] music up I'm like why is it louder than
[11:23:26] him Guild much like the genius Society
[11:23:28] has taken a keen interest in the recent
[11:23:31] Calamity in penone ultimately both it's
[11:23:34] so L it sounds like like at the Oscars
[11:23:36] or like the game awards when they like
[11:23:37] wrap it up and they blast the music so
[11:23:39] the guy talking you can't he's like
[11:23:40] drowning in the
[11:23:41] sound the floor is yours for final
[11:23:45] cerum organic life's unrelenting search
[11:23:49] to understand the realm of inner
[11:23:51] spirituality is something I both admire
[11:23:54] and envy inorganic life has no mechanism
[11:23:58] to what are you talking about but when
[11:24:00] my mechanical impulses are activated my
[11:24:03] inspiration circuits will start to
[11:24:05] operate and I will enter a state defined
[11:24:08] every time within the realm of
[11:24:10] imagination their alas they are after
[11:24:13] delber
[11:24:14] not only that we've also established
[11:24:17] contact with the garden of recollection
[11:24:19] through the
[11:24:20] IPC and they've pledged their support
[11:24:22] for our research Endeavors I'm truly
[11:24:25] happy for the Dreamchasers on pentacon
[11:24:27] the cosmos's brightest and let's admit
[11:24:31] dimmer are now that's [ __ ]
[11:24:35] up it's a big
[11:24:40] double it's only a matter of time till
[11:24:42] stal say Gat okay I'm just warning you
[11:24:45] guys I'm just warning you
[11:24:48] guys also I thought Sunday was the
[11:24:50] classist one I realized it's it's
[11:24:52] probably ratio it's between ratio and AO
[11:24:57] now it's a big W for everyone
[11:25:01] but never mind at the end of the day
[11:25:05] this is a positive
[11:25:09] outcome no wonder everyone insisted that
[11:25:12] she'd be there it heartens me to learn
[11:25:14] that everyone is willing to put aside
[11:25:16] their differences for penton's
[11:25:18] plight I trust that everyone will surely
[11:25:21] reach consensus in the upcoming
[11:25:23] negotiations looks like penton's future
[11:25:26] is
[11:25:27] decided I'm one peace is our greatest
[11:25:30] wish piss beyond that we desire nothing
[11:25:34] else well that's good now that
[11:25:37] everyone's minds are at ease I shall
[11:25:40] take my le you may now depart with peace
[11:25:43] of mind
[11:25:45] the alliance will be with all wait are
[11:25:47] we actually done I thought there was
[11:25:48] more if that's the case it appears that
[11:25:52] we have nothing else to worry about on

[11:28:13] their own purpose personal
[11:28:16] reasons as you all may know the astral
[11:28:19] Express never declines any passenger
[11:28:21] whose heart yearns for the distant Stars
[11:28:25] therefore traving with us for a while
[11:28:27] until reach their destinations whoa the

[11:28:59] that everyone firstly pom pom wishes to
[11:29:02] thank everyone if it weren't for you all
[11:29:04] unearthing the truth about pentacon pom
[11:29:07] pom would have never known where
[11:29:10] M what they had to go through was
[11:29:12] regrettable but I can they all fulfilled
[11:29:15] their wishes now then we come to the
[11:29:17] Crux of this navigation meeting the
[11:29:19] first choice is from himo the oceanic
[11:29:22] planet of laka a planet composed
[11:29:25] entirely of water Ki many aquatic races
[11:29:28] reside there of course it's also the
[11:29:30] home planet of the
[11:29:34] venerable the second choice is the agot
[11:29:36] world melanin suggested by welt
[11:29:39] melatonin named as one of the initial
[11:29:41] sites of the stellon disaster and the
[11:29:44] place where the beauty adilla ascended
[11:29:47] today it's celebrated as a planet of
[11:29:50] undying Allure the third choice is ostar
[11:29:54] a planet nestled within a vast ion storm
[11:29:56] region currently under assault by the
[11:29:59] antimatter Legion The Last Choice
[11:30:01] courtesy of Black Swan is the glass belt
[11:30:04] petraia a massive belt of asteroids that
[11:30:06] was turned to Glass by the Lord ravager
[11:30:09] zephro oo next up everyone will select
[11:30:13] the Destin that they wish to visit and
[11:30:16] then we'll put it to a
[11:30:19] vote laka little Misha and old male's
[11:30:23] Homeland having been through so much in
[11:30:25] pentacon as an aspiring nameless I
[11:30:28] believe a visit to his home world is a
[11:30:30] must Count Me In still I imagine that
[11:30:34] planet must have changed entirely after
[11:30:37] the stellon disaster I've heard that its
[11:30:40] land masses no longer exist and the
[11:30:42] native population has has completely
[11:30:45] changed H I'm not against Miss heimo's
[11:30:48] choice but ostar sounds like it's in
[11:30:51] danger nope remember when Robin went to
[11:30:53] help a place in danger and got shot yeah
[11:30:55] I remember let's not do that which is
[11:30:57] right though the fact that the distress
[11:31:00] signals have ceased means we're probably
[11:31:01] too
[11:31:02] late but I still think we should
[11:31:05] investigate the situation there three
[11:31:07] votes for Lusaka looks like we have a
[11:31:10] winner next up luaka the Planet wait
[11:31:14] really is this scripted or this
[11:31:16] navigation Mee ised I mean I know we're
[11:31:19] going back I mean I saw I'm not dumb
[11:31:21] like I saw the the new San characters so
[11:31:23] I know we're not going there now but
[11:31:25] like maybe we're actually going there
[11:31:26] next when it's time to make the jump pom
[11:31:28] pom will make an announcement there's
[11:31:30] still some time before the
[11:31:33] jump what should I
[11:31:38] do how about a chat over here
[11:31:45] oh you're here seeing your reflection
[11:31:49] Among the Stars in the port
[11:31:52] hole really does seem somewhat
[11:31:56] surreal how about it this journey of
[11:32:00] beautiful
[11:32:01] dreams was it to your
[11:32:08] liking what a roller coaster ride it's
[11:32:10] just so Peak keep it coming it kind of
[11:32:13] left me running more you know seems like
[11:32:15] there's still a lot of Lo Loose Ends no
[11:32:17] it's why do they have the valerant
[11:32:18] accent here it's it's sort of a dece x
[11:32:21] Machina when the next survey comes I'll
[11:32:23] be checking the too easy box
[11:32:26] [Music]
[11:32:31] again there's a rich scent of curiosity
[11:32:35] here such memories can be irresistibly
[11:32:40] captivating so how about you hand that
[11:32:44] small Parting Gift back to
[11:32:48] me what was the small parting gift to
[11:32:50] have it
[11:32:51] back
[11:32:53] oh oh
[11:32:56] okay oh
[11:33:01] oh never mind I just stumbled upon a
[11:33:06] particularly fascinating spot in your
[11:33:08] memory uhoh before I explain I would
[11:33:12] like to apologize to you
[11:33:14] you this farewell gift I gave you isn't
[11:33:17] really a compass from the memory Zone
[11:33:20] but merely an empty light her voice is
[11:33:23] nice dude I feel like black Swan's like
[11:33:24] a ASMR YouTuber in the Dreamscape for
[11:33:27] the first time and I procured a few
[11:33:31] trinkets from your
[11:33:32] companions their functions are
[11:33:36] similar this way I can always be attuned
[11:33:40] to your location ready to assist
[11:33:42] immediately if you en encounter any
[11:33:44] threats but this is not its most
[11:33:48] intrinsic function light cones are
[11:33:51] slices of light used to encapsulate
[11:33:53] solidified phenomena this empty light
[11:33:56] cone is the same it can etch your
[11:34:00] memories in their most Vivid form and
[11:34:03] then allow me to admire and manipulate
[11:34:07] them turning them into unique
[11:34:11] momentos all the world is born from the
[11:34:14] power of mind and soul and that power is
[11:34:18] memory to prevent ourselves from being
[11:34:21] forgotten by the world we must make the
[11:34:24] world remember
[11:34:25] us or use our memories to recreate it so
[11:34:30] do you want to make new memories
[11:34:32] together I'm sorry I'm sorry life
[11:34:35] seemingly vast offers but a scant
[11:34:38] collection of impactful
[11:34:40] memories some joyful some sorrowful some
[11:34:45] light some heavy but you are different
[11:34:50] memory is a reflection of the future
[11:34:54] within that reflection I see your
[11:34:57] unparalleled
[11:34:59] worth you have the power to craft
[11:35:02] memories that can Captivate the world
[11:35:05] your memories why did fate make me laugh
[11:35:07] universe's Future Path and that memory
[11:35:11] will be as scintilating as the star
[11:35:14] clusters you see in this
[11:35:18] portal you're making me
[11:35:21] blush how adorable uhoh but do you know
[11:35:25] the deeper meaning behind
[11:35:28] it the reason is simple in this
[11:35:32] grandiose and ostentatious dream of the
[11:35:35] families only you personally experienced
[11:35:39] the entire
[11:35:41] course stop speaking in

[11:35:59] the arrival of their next destination
[11:36:02] all filled with hopes and expectations
[11:36:05] of their own present and
[11:36:08] future revealing everything at this
[11:36:11] moment would be a bit of buzz kill does

[11:37:40] 2158 of the Amber era the first year of
[11:37:45] the new
[11:37:46] Epoch the universe resumed its intended
[11:37:51] trajectory the kindling of conspiracies
[11:37:54] smoldered in pentacon the land of the
[11:37:59] dreams failing to erupt into a blaze it
[11:38:03] instead flickered briefly on kath's
[11:38:07] Anvil before Vanishing in the blink of
[11:38:11] an eye
[11:38:13] the dead and those faded to die remain
[11:38:17] in their Eternal
[11:38:19] Slumber while the living find solace in
[11:38:22] deep
[11:38:24] Sleep all clamored in a cacophony of
[11:38:28] silence and then went about their own
[11:38:32] ways the cosmos emanated A Vitality
[11:38:35] characteristic of a new
[11:38:38] era all for the modest price of a
[11:38:41] brother and sister's mild
[11:38:44] grief babies are born as stars

[11:39:01] new Time Marches forward heralding the
[11:39:05] arrival of a new chapter in the history

[11:40:35] battle against Sunday everyone in
[11:40:38] paniconi failed and no one survived
[11:40:47] huh but don't
[11:40:50] panic the truth as horrifying as it may

[11:41:04] here next I'll use this empty light conb
[11:41:07] that carries all your memories to relive
[11:41:10] everything that happened before
[11:41:14] and when this story reaches its end I'm
[11:41:17] sure someone as clever as you will
[11:41:20] notice
[11:41:22] that there's a major flaw in the story
[11:41:25] you have
[11:41:26] experienced yet within that flaw lies a
[11:41:30] glimmer of
[11:41:32] hope are you ready for it
[11:41:36] yes do you remember
[11:41:39] everything when the clock turned back
[11:41:41] the express started warp jump sending
[11:41:44] you to a strange
[11:41:46] dream you were bewildered back then and
[11:41:50] then a galaxy ranger named acaron showed
[11:41:52] you a way
[11:41:55] out when you arrived at the revery Hotel
[11:41:58] you met the dman Misha bro this was like
[11:42:00] two months ago more this like four an
[11:42:03] IPC
[11:42:05] representative thankfully acaron
[11:42:08] appeared again and helped
[11:42:11] you after that you you saved Firefly and
[11:42:14] explored pentacon I remember this my
[11:42:17] goat during the tour you ran into
[11:42:19] Sparkle disguised as sampo and
[11:42:22] accidentally entered a child's
[11:42:25] dream yeah I remember there I rescued
[11:42:28] both of you from death but Firefly
[11:42:31] didn't return to
[11:42:33] reality she realized the truth and tried
[11:42:36] to involve you in her plan but that
[11:42:39] resulted in an accidental death
[11:42:43] even more unsettling you soon
[11:42:46] encountered another
[11:42:49] murder the two cases of death prompted
[11:42:52] you to investigate the truth behind the
[11:42:54] sweet
[11:42:56] dream despite your efforts to gather
[11:42:58] information about the two victims you
[11:43:01] didn't make much
[11:43:03] progress but you did learn about the
[11:43:06] watch maker from
[11:43:09] Gallagher meanwhile aventurine was
[11:43:12] secretly carrying out his scheme in
[11:43:14] which you were one of the
[11:43:17] ponds in the midst of a fierce battle
[11:43:20] acaron revealed her true identity as an
[11:43:23] emanator of the nil and unsheathed her
[11:43:27] sword that strike foiled aventurine plan
[11:43:31] and opened a passage between the sweet
[11:43:34] dream and the original memory
[11:43:37] Zone upon your arrival at dream flux
[11:43:40] Reef you learned the truth that death
[11:43:43] death was actually
[11:43:45] dorcy as well as the truth about the
[11:43:48] Dreamscape the stellon and the bell boy
[11:43:53] Misha you split up with Sunday and Robin
[11:43:57] looking for a way to seal the
[11:44:00] stellon however it turned out that
[11:44:02] Sunday and the dream master had their
[11:44:05] own hidden agenda okay and you had to
[11:44:09] engage in an ultimate duel on the stage
[11:44:11] where the [ __ ] is Robin now though
[11:44:14] Festival finally the story reached its
[11:44:18] conclusion you emerged Victorious with
[11:44:21] the trailblaze triumphing over the order
[11:44:24] and pentacon embracing a bright and
[11:44:27] peaceful
[11:44:29] future this marks the end of the
[11:44:32] thrilling journey in

[11:45:21] firefly and Robin acon unsheathed her
[11:45:23] sword and revealed the power of nil
[11:45:25] death is the disguise of
[11:45:29] [Music]
[11:45:38] dorcy okay I have a few it could be two
[11:45:41] things in my mind first of all
[11:45:43] could could Misha have escaped the
[11:45:44] bubble that early on maybe I don't think
[11:45:48] it's
[11:45:52] this

[11:46:05] like dorm he's my pet but I don't who
[11:46:07] the I don't remember who said that [ __ ]

[11:46:21] option on purpose so you talk to me I
[11:46:22] knew it was this one little I knew it I
[11:46:24] knew it was one I said it was one though
[11:46:25] or should I call him I knew it cuz
[11:46:27] there's no way he escaped the bubble
[11:46:28] that early only a segment of memory in a
[11:46:30] dream bubble but his ambition for the
[11:46:33] trailblaze led him to leave the bubble
[11:46:37] and embark on a I just wanted to know

[11:46:41] well Misha is
[11:46:44] and he was granted Power by the trail
[11:46:47] plays there's still one thing that he
[11:46:50] shouldn't be able to do a life born in
[11:46:53] the memory Zone man
[11:46:57] reality so why did he appear in the Ry
[11:47:01] hotel in
[11:47:03] reality the answer is
[11:47:06] simple he is the one fatal variable that
[11:47:10] contradicts all our know known
[11:47:14] information this means that you who
[11:47:18] wholeheartedly believe in this memory
[11:47:21] are still trapped in the
[11:47:24] Dreamscape at this very
[11:47:31] moment
[11:47:38] huh oh that makes
[11:47:41] sense because he can't be in reality we
[11:47:45] have to be in the Dreamscape whenever we
[11:47:47] see
[11:47:48] Misha uh-oh beep it's [ __ ] the heita
[11:47:53] all over
[11:47:55] again Wake up sleepy head break free

[11:50:22] wait so hello we're back in
[11:50:28] 2.0 I'm kind of glad there's more cuz if
[11:50:30] the quest ended there I would have felt
[11:50:31] a little
[11:50:34] empty thank you so much
[11:50:39] blackan finally I can breathe a sigh
[11:50:43] leave okay now that we're experiencing
[11:50:45] Peak I'm going to say something that's
[11:50:47] going to upset the lore fans I feel like
[11:50:49] Sunday like one hour of the quest where
[11:50:51] they're yapping about the bird over and
[11:50:53] over could have been avoided I'm sorry
[11:50:54] okay let's keep going like I feel like
[11:50:56] one hour of my life is gone but
[11:50:58] everything else was good what happened
[11:50:59] what is this place the deja vu is strong
[11:51:01] with this
[11:51:04] scene I understand you must be confused
[11:51:07] and we'll do our best to shed light on
[11:51:09] the
[11:51:09] situation however before that it's
[11:51:11] essential to to know
[11:51:14] that this place is the rift between
[11:51:16] dream and
[11:51:18] reality a place reserved only for those
[11:51:21] who have awakened from Anna's dream okay
[11:51:24] do you remember Sunday's ambitious
[11:51:29] plan he intended to harness the power of
[11:51:32] the stellon the collective will of over
[11:51:35] 100,000 it was 10
[11:51:38] 7,336 actually 107 336 but it's okay
[11:51:41] you're the me you're the memory keeper
[11:51:42] you should know this and restore the
[11:51:46] order unfortunately it didn't stop there
[11:51:49] from the early days of our journey into
[11:51:51] asdon we were already affected by the
[11:51:54] stellon that strange
[11:51:56] dream X donated one maybe a sign that
[11:51:59] your literally you true y yap
[11:52:02] yap what all this is just a dream that I
[11:52:06] fall asleep on the express I'm now back
[11:52:08] at the beginning of the story
[11:52:12] I don't think the goal of the order was
[11:52:15] to put everyone into a deep
[11:52:17] sleep quite the
[11:52:19] contrary they used the stellon to
[11:52:22] catalyze the leakage of a Sorry's
[11:52:25] Memoria into the material world allowing
[11:52:28] the Dreamscape to blend with reality and
[11:52:31] that included a lot of Memoria from the
[11:52:33] beyond the sky oh [ __ ] they're saying
[11:52:35] Memoria again I got a drink as time came
[11:52:36] and went the dreams of did I miss
[11:52:39] any Memorial
[11:52:44] they became indistinguishable from
[11:52:45] reality and reality became an
[11:52:49] illusion people think they are awake but
[11:52:52] their Spirits have long since stepped
[11:52:54] into the Temple of
[11:52:56] order this is what makes Anna's dream so
[11:53:00] powerful in this paradise governed by
[11:53:03] the order everyone indulges in their
[11:53:06] delightful dreams and lives happily ever
[11:53:09] after I believe what you experienced in
[11:53:11] the sweet dream except for that flaw was
[11:53:16] real only in this way could you reach
[11:53:19] the destination lifting the crisis in
[11:53:22] pentacon and embarking on your next
[11:53:25] trailblazing Expedition if it wasn't for
[11:53:28] Aaron's plan we might have been trapped
[11:53:30] in this dream forever fortunately while
[11:53:33] the path of the order governs all things
[11:53:35] it can't affect the
[11:53:37] nil I nil is broken what the hell Master
[11:53:40] tried to expel me at any cost
[11:53:43] this is also why you felt a sense of
[11:53:45] peculiarity when traveling with
[11:53:48] her well I'm not as fortunate as she is
[11:53:53] even if I'm a memo keeper I was still
[11:53:56] influenced by the power of the order and
[11:53:59] fell into
[11:54:00] hallucinations however thanks to your
[11:54:04] memories now we still have a chance to
[11:54:06] turn the
[11:54:08] tide for Mortals even if they possess
[11:54:11] the Great power of a path they can't
[11:54:14] create a Flawless world like gods do
[11:54:17] that's why there was a flaw in your
[11:54:19] dream in other words once you have
[11:54:22] realized the world is not real you'll
[11:54:24] have a chance to break free from the
[11:54:26] dream the flaw in your dream lies within
[11:54:29] Misha who could have never appeared in
[11:54:33] reality when I turned the pages of your
[11:54:36] memories I realized that I was in an
[11:54:40] illusion too huh
[11:54:45] didn't expect it all comes back didn't
[11:54:47] expect it all comes back to Misha now
[11:54:50] Sunday has usurped the power of the
[11:54:53] harmonious choir through the charmony
[11:54:55] Festival Asana has thus fallen into
[11:54:58] Anna's
[11:54:59] dream everyone equally into the notes of
[11:55:02] the
[11:55:07] Eon oh
[11:55:11] pog
[11:55:13] standard I mean that's weapon
[11:55:30] PS failure doesn't mean
[11:55:34] weakness Only the Strong can gather the
[11:55:36] will to resist the order and try to
[11:55:39] break free
[11:55:45] why are people saying to all to 10
[11:55:47] people I feel like everyone got it Kos
[11:55:48] tweeted it there's no way he randomly
[11:55:50] got lucky I think it's for I think
[11:55:51] everyone gets it unless this guy just
[11:55:54] got
[11:55:57] lucky everyone got it okay we still have
[11:56:00] a chance though to make it
[11:56:03] happen please Black Swan guide us to
[11:56:07] those with a strong will
[11:56:12] it was originally for 10 but they got
[11:56:13] flamed I see all right please come with
[11:56:17] me yes ma'am these people
[11:56:20] are they're the ones who accept Anna's
[11:56:23] dream and indulge in their happy
[11:56:26] Illusions we have no means to wake them
[11:56:28] up can I just
[11:56:30] TP yes no not even your Clockwork will
[11:56:35] do the
[11:56:40] trick uh okay
[11:56:42] however there are still other things we
[11:56:44] can do let's keep
[11:56:47] going talk to an
[11:56:57] NPC you missed one Memorial like 3 to 4
[11:57:00] hours ago when gallaga was revealing
[11:57:02] watch maker resting place oh sorry oh
[11:57:05] it's Robin
[11:57:07] it's Robin that's what I just said
[11:57:14] glitching in six months ay
[11:57:16] Boba hey
[11:57:18] Robin a
[11:57:21] boba finally you've arrived what do you
[11:57:25] mean by that let me introduce you to
[11:57:26] Robin she woke up from Anna's dream by
[11:57:29] her own will and it's this tough lady
[11:57:33] who led us here with her
[11:57:36] song I woke up for the same reason as
[11:57:39] all of you in the dream I experienced
[11:57:42] something that could
[11:57:46] never what happened you say we going to
[11:57:50] Lo it up you [ __ ] you [ __ ] I want to see
[11:57:52] it Fly freely in the
[11:57:55] [Music]
[11:57:57] sky without us this bird would be too
[11:58:01] fragile to survive on its
[11:58:03] own do you want it to
[11:58:06] die no
[11:58:08] but it's the same bird
[11:58:12] then let's take care of it together
[11:58:14] until it can return to the
[11:58:17] sky huh oh anomaly birds have wings
[11:58:21] because they're meant to fly anomaly
[11:58:24] even if they may crash on the ground oh
[11:58:26] it's like Exit 8 they shouldn't be we
[11:58:28] should play that game donated
[11:58:31] $1 birs belong to the sky so we should
[11:58:36] help them oh they showed us the story 26
[11:58:39] times cuz they're eventually goingon to
[11:58:40] anomaly it I get it okay so what about
[11:58:42] Sunday in the
[11:58:43] church okay
[11:58:47] sorry the illusion was so impossibly
[11:58:51] Blissful that I realized it was just a
[11:58:54] dream and this is our final hope enna
[11:58:58] dream is founded upon the harmonious
[11:59:01] choir namely everyone shared wishes it
[11:59:05] will only materialize once the
[11:59:07] aspirations of all beings in pentacon
[11:59:09] merge as
[11:59:11] one present it has become impervious due
[11:59:14] to people's desire to remain slumbering
[11:59:16] with wait but wasn't that
[11:59:18] a and in order to wait wait but wasn't
[11:59:21] that a memory so her anomaly was she had
[11:59:23] a memory that was wrong isn't that weird
[11:59:25] wait how if her memory of the bird story
[11:59:28] is wrong couldn't she just be like wait
[11:59:29] maybe I just had a bad
[11:59:32] memory like that's not something that
[11:59:34] happened
[11:59:36] like wasn't that like 20 years ago how
[11:59:39] old is she like 20 that's like 20 years
[11:59:40] ago
[11:59:42] [Music]
[11:59:45] it's a lamp oh did did she like see the
[11:59:48] thing I
[11:59:51] don't the dream was changing the memory
[11:59:54] yeah yeah yeah but like okay let's say I
[11:59:55] have a childhood memory and then like
[11:59:56] today I'm like I remember the memory a
[11:59:58] bit differently I wouldn't be like Oh
[12:00:00] I'm in a dream I would be like maybe
[12:00:02] maybe I just misremembered this no but I
[12:00:04] guess I guess she knows Sunday's an
[12:00:06] [ __ ] so he wouldn't say that okay
[12:00:07] fair
[12:00:09] enough we must make everyone in penone
[12:00:12] want to wake
[12:00:14] up now comes the tricky part how do we
[12:00:18] do
[12:00:21] it just [ __ ] bring Boot Hill with a
[12:00:24] gun [ __ ] put a gun to their head
[12:00:26] they'll be like okay I'll wake up
[12:00:30] [Music]
[12:00:36] thoughts humans yearning for sweet
[12:00:39] illusion no way I just W up leading them
[12:00:42] to subconsciously resist the harsh
[12:00:46] reality therefore I carefully selected a
[12:00:50] moment where she was completely
[12:00:52] unguarded guiding her to uncover the
[12:00:55] truth herself to make her regain her
[12:00:58] Consciousness however to wake up
[12:01:00] everyone in paniconi and get them to
[12:01:03] share the same
[12:01:05] determination that would be nearly
[12:01:08] impossible indeed I'm afraid it's almost
[12:01:11] a difficult to what if we just flash a
[12:01:13] sign that says you're in a dream wake up
[12:01:16] but we can't just stay here and do
[12:01:21] nothing like a big billboard this is a
[12:01:24] critical moment for the whole universe
[12:01:27] who cares about some dumb
[12:01:32] number thanks to Black
[12:01:35] Swan you're welcome and thanks to the
[12:01:39] memo Keepers in pentacon too I believe
[12:01:42] your partners have also awakened from
[12:01:46] their
[12:01:47] dreams this is the first step of our
[12:01:50] plan with the assistance from the garden
[12:01:52] of recollection those who possess a
[12:01:55] strong will like you will gradually
[12:01:57] awaken from the dream these free wills
[12:02:00] are the Discord that will sway Anna's
[12:02:04] dream however Awakening a mere handful
[12:02:07] of individuals is insignificant compared
[12:02:09] to the vast number of people immersing
[12:02:12] in the dream we must find other ways to
[12:02:15] awaken the Free Will of millions of
[12:02:17] people within a short period of time if
[12:02:20] breaking through from the inside proves
[12:02:22] challeng 11 a.m. we can seek assistance
[12:02:24] from the outside we've long been aware
[12:02:27] of a potential
[12:02:29] solution Asana is a galaxy known for its
[12:02:32] abundant Memoria and the remarkable
[12:02:34] phenomenon known as sinesia Dreamscape
[12:02:37] when people first enter this place they
[12:02:40] often find themselves and others sh ing
[12:02:42] a collective dream at this very moment
[12:02:45] there was only one dream encompassing
[12:02:48] the entire asdon system so you mean if
[12:02:52] we can attract a large number of
[12:02:54] Outsiders to this system their Free Will
[12:02:57] would intertwine with this dream and
[12:02:59] shake it to its core however those
[12:03:02] Outsiders might also succumb to the
[12:03:05] dream and become the foundation of the
[12:03:07] order
[12:03:09] instead the real challenge is how can we
[12:03:12] gather a huge number of people as
[12:03:15] determined as you within a short period
[12:03:18] of
[12:03:19] time looks like the Jade abiss of no no
[12:03:23] need for that keep your wants in a
[12:03:25] lifetime treasure we don't need to
[12:03:28] bother the sieno wait okay no disrespect
[12:03:31] has booill done anything yet thousands
[12:03:33] of people with unwavering Free
[12:03:36] Will that's
[12:03:38] easy just leave it to us Galaxy Rangers
[12:03:42] you can gather Galaxy
[12:03:45] Rangers Outsiders may see Galaxy Rangers
[12:03:49] as Elusive and disconnected individuals
[12:03:53] and actually they're right and that's
[12:03:56] why we have a tacid understanding Among
[12:04:00] Us do you know what it is acaron a butt
[12:04:05] plug it's The Relic I returned to you
[12:04:08] exactly its owner must have told you
[12:04:11] that it's meaningless to anyone other
[12:04:14] than a galaxy ranger and that it can
[12:04:16] only fulfill its purpose when returned
[12:04:18] to its rightful owner because it's a
[12:04:22] burial
[12:04:23] artifact we're the
[12:04:25] only who has served the Galaxy with
[12:04:29] honor when it lad illuminates the
[12:04:31] universe it means the fall of a hero
[12:04:35] countless meteors will streak across the
[12:04:38] sky those meteors are Galaxy Rangers
[12:04:43] coming from all corners of the cosmos
[12:04:45] driven by a shared purpose without
[12:04:49] questioning the cause or counting the
[12:04:51] cost because we abide by a common
[12:04:54] principle what's the principle the
[12:04:56] shooting stars of the hunt only descend
[12:04:58] on the longest night and with them comes
[12:05:03] the dawn we've stayed silent for far too
[12:05:07] long now it's time to remind all the
[12:05:11] cowards
[12:05:12] oppressors and villains of the universe
[12:05:14] of our presence I'll be the one to
[12:05:17] ignite the first Spark D wait about to
[12:05:20] be useful wait I'll complete the Second
[12:05:24] Step I'll fine-tune the slumbering souls
[12:05:26] with the song of the harmony
[12:05:28] interrupting them with the Discord of
[12:05:30] trailblaze and guiding them towards
[12:05:33] reality it's true that some people are
[12:05:36] born strong and others are born
[12:05:39] weak if the trail blazes the Target of
[12:05:42] Heroes then the harmony will guarantee
[12:05:45] that the strong help the weak only the
[12:05:48] people of pentacon themselves can be the
[12:05:50] saviors of their their path of Happiness
[12:05:51] should be forged by
[12:05:54] themselves thanks Robin
[12:05:57] namess I'm willing to instill courage in
[12:06:00] all those who need it this includes my
[12:06:02] brother as
[12:06:04] well and his
[12:06:07] dream is too cruel for him your plan
[12:06:10] sounds well conceived but still it
[12:06:13] appears somewhat idealistic and
[12:06:19] romantic the flaws rooted in human
[12:06:22] nature can't be eradicated
[12:06:25] overnight do you believe these efforts
[12:06:28] alone are enough to convince everyone to
[12:06:31] choose the right
[12:06:33] path I agree with you Black Swan that's
[12:06:36] why the most critical aspect of this
[12:06:38] plan is not to convince everyone to to
[12:06:41] choose the right
[12:06:43] path but to inspire them to save
[12:06:47] themselves Inspire them to save
[12:06:49] themselves so you're the key in the end
[12:06:53] the harmonious choir possesses the power
[12:06:55] of an
[12:06:56] emanator to overcome it you'll need the
[12:06:59] same level of power the final step in
[12:07:02] destroying the sweet dream that's a
[12:07:05] relief to
[12:07:06] hear now that our roles are
[12:07:09] assigned let's get your our Battlefield
[12:07:12] impose a grand
[12:07:16] finale May I have a moment alone with
[12:07:20] you yes one more thing I need to explain
[12:07:22] to
[12:07:24] you this grand festival is drawing to
[12:07:27] its
[12:07:27] close this is the starting point for the
[12:07:30] ultimate stage of our
[12:07:32] journey just as it marked the beginning
[12:07:34] of all the stories in pentacon
[12:07:50] only by reflecting on our steps can we
[12:07:52] remember the path we should be walking
[12:07:54] on and the companions who have walked
[12:07:57] alongside
[12:07:59] us there's something you should know we
[12:08:02] were able to locate you within this
[12:08:04] boundless dream and find the key to
[12:08:07] Breaking Free from the
[12:08:08] dream all because of one person 's
[12:08:11] unwavering dedication
[12:08:14] Firefly
[12:08:16] Firefly she awakened from the dream
[12:08:19] ahead watched discovered the express
[12:08:21] amidst the stars and brought us valuable
[12:08:24] information about the remnants of the
[12:08:26] order she may have been aided by the
[12:08:29] script and it came at a
[12:08:33] cost as you know Firefly is a stowaway
[12:08:38] who entered the Dreamscape in a
[12:08:39] different way from ours
[12:08:42] without the dream po or assistance from
[12:08:45] the
[12:08:46] family she can only awaken from this
[12:08:48] dream in one
[12:08:50] way a real death

[12:14:55] countless ripples or a bug bite I don't

[12:15:01] fleeting lifetimes of
[12:15:03] humans and for
[12:15:05] some their presence leaves such a strong
[12:15:08] Mark that it's reflected in the waves
[12:15:11] weing waves sin
[12:15:13] thers the obsessions of the path
[12:15:16] Striders they emerge from the depths of

[12:20:44] between reality and
[12:20:46] Imagination all right gray life is akin
[12:20:50] to a winding Labyrinth where memories
[12:20:54] serve as our soul may your schemes be
[12:20:58] forever
[12:20:59] concealed Anna's dream is too cool for
[12:21:03] to the imperfect tomorrow please stay
[12:21:07] tun I still remember a question on the
[12:21:11] invitation
[12:21:14] letter why does life
[12:21:22] Slumber why does life
[12:21:25] Slumber we don't know the answer yet but
[12:21:28] we're about to awaken from this dream
[12:21:31] someone answered that earlier such is
[12:21:34] the dialogue is like why does life
[12:21:35] Slumber and then she said it leave this
[12:21:38] place return to where you belong
[12:21:41] and awaken panone from this
[12:21:46] dream will you come with us what if
[12:21:48] folks don't want to wake up will I get
[12:21:50] to witness your hidden Powers as I said
[12:21:53] our plan is not about convincing
[12:21:55] everyone to choose the right path but
[12:21:58] about inspiring them to save
[12:22:01] themselves so when will people actively
[12:22:06] save themselves the answer
[12:22:08] is when they are in desperate situations
[12:22:12] like a drowning individual in the deep
[12:22:15] sea yeah that's why I said get Boot Hill
[12:22:17] to [ __ ] whip his gun out on everyone
[12:22:20] oh [ __ ] wake up [ __ ] oh [ __ ] hey
[12:22:24] Z thanks for the raid I firmly believe

[12:22:38] dude it wasn't even that bad okay in my
[12:22:41] defense I'm really good at cloggy
[12:22:42] puzzles that one was the hardest one
[12:22:43] I've ever done the fragility of
[12:22:46] humankind often freezes them in their
[12:22:49] tracks but in truly desperate situations
[12:22:52] they will strive to save
[12:22:55] themselves and
[12:22:57] now paniconi has enough Heroes to lead
[12:23:00] them
[12:23:01] forward it's through this inherent
[12:23:05] self-centered Instinct that people exert
[12:23:08] their utmost effort even when they know
[12:23:11] their struggle is
[12:23:13] fruitless as absurd as it may seem it's
[12:23:17] their resistance does she not get cold
[12:23:20] she's like barely wearing a shirt I feel
[12:23:23] like I'd be cold I mean like I
[12:23:24] appreciate it but I feel like I'd be
[12:23:26] cold wait w would just twet it twice oh
[12:23:29] yeah see
[12:23:33] Temple
[12:23:38] any as for now
[12:23:41] it is time to guide them not as a savior
[12:23:45] but as a nameless among those
[12:23:48] Mortals in this
[12:23:51] way you will reunite in the warmth of
[12:23:54] the
[12:23:56] sunlight she barely feels things true
[12:23:58] the rain is wait does she have Co
[12:24:01] intensifying that's [ __ ] hope she's
[12:24:03] okay before we part with cuz she can't
[12:24:05] taste either right please allow me to
[12:24:07] ask a few final
[12:24:08] questions so far are you have
[12:24:12] forged bonds with numerous individuals
[12:24:15] do you think Bill believes Co is real or
[12:24:17] no cuz he's kind of
[12:24:18] like it's kind of like yeehaw I'm
[12:24:22] sorry acon outfit is warm wait
[12:24:25] [Music]
[12:24:31] how okay sorry I got distracted so far
[12:24:34] you forge unbreakable bonds of newest
[12:24:35] individuals true might I ask you fear
[12:24:39] severing these bonds with your own hands
[12:24:45] Bond I feel no fear wait what the
[12:24:54] hell if there is a vast lifelike
[12:24:57] Dreamland that is virtually
[12:24:59] indistinguishable from
[12:25:01] reality a realm without death where
[12:25:05] everyone can attain the happiness and
[12:25:07] fulfillment they deserve living BL
[12:25:10] pefully ever
[12:25:12] after I would
[12:25:14] ask would you wish to stay
[12:25:17] yes no I I mean no I mean if you're
[12:25:21] there gorgeous
[12:25:25] sorry imagine if this Splendid dream
[12:25:29] were faded to fall
[12:25:31] apart friends family
[12:25:35] strangers followed by the gentle breeze
[12:25:38] soaring Birds the Star
[12:25:41] ours and ultimately
[12:25:45] yourself everyone and every face they
[12:25:49] remember the joy and the
[12:25:52] heartaches the vows sealed and those
[12:25:54] left
[12:25:56] healing all will inevitably March
[12:25:59] towards a predetermined
[12:26:02] ending if you had grasped the Journey's
[12:26:05] finale right from its Inception I would
[12:26:08] ask
[12:26:10] would you still embark on this journey
[12:26:13] yes because I got to meet you sorry yes
[12:26:16] because I'm a Trailblazer I would always
[12:26:18] blaze a
[12:26:20] trail who up blazing the trail sorry I'm
[12:26:24] glad the answer itself doesn't
[12:26:27] matter what matters is that you've made
[12:26:30] a
[12:26:31] decision listen touch and
[12:26:35] Ponder and therein lies the
[12:26:38] sensation check is it because that's
[12:26:41] what makes us
[12:26:44] exist such is the only answer humans can
[12:26:47] offer when facing the
[12:26:52] nihility if the nihility represents the
[12:26:55] Primal Fear of Life rendering any lofty
[12:26:58] convictions insignificant under their
[12:27:00] imposing
[12:27:02] Shadow then behind this
[12:27:05] Shadow there must exist the most fervent
[12:27:08] source of light in the world
[12:27:11] [Music]
[12:27:15] just as every life that edges closer to
[12:27:18] death fervently approaches the end of
[12:27:20] the
[12:27:21] nihility we must pursue that primordial
[12:27:27] light now to think that you exist in the
[12:27:33] nil and you watch over others to depart
[12:27:36] it such a task is absurd and
[12:27:40] meaningless
[12:27:42] nevertheless someone had to do
[12:27:45] it as for the meaning you mentioned even
[12:27:48] if it's a meaningless
[12:27:50] task I've come this far haven't I even
[12:27:54] if the future of Forge may not even
[12:27:58] belong to you it may not belong to me
[12:28:01] but it definitely belongs to
[12:28:07] someone hardships is this so
[12:28:11] sad in that
[12:28:14] case allow me to do something
[12:28:17] meaningless too
[12:28:20] please tell me your
[12:28:24] name uh-oh is she going to say something
[12:28:26] other than acon my
[12:28:29] name Jonathan perhaps oh no mind she
[12:28:32] just moed existence will vanish in the
[12:28:36] next moment and nobody
[12:28:40] will remember this conversation or your
[12:28:45] answer but I
[12:28:47] [Music]
[12:28:49] believe that your name should be
[12:28:54] remembered and this
[12:28:57] universe will remember
[12:28:59] it as
[12:29:03] well for
[12:29:06] me some things are difficult to recall
[12:29:10] yet there are others this this makes
[12:29:11] sense cuz she said she guard the acaron
[12:29:13] river so maybe her name's not acaron and
[12:29:15] she was just like I guard the acaron
[12:29:17] river a creation of the past that she's
[12:29:20] also slow dancing with the memory keeper
[12:29:22] so maybe she like told her something I
[12:29:23] don't know I remember that marks the
[12:29:26] start of my
[12:29:28] journey the origin of the vibrant red
[12:29:31] Hue in my
[12:29:33] life and the most fervent element amidst
[12:29:36] every
[12:29:37] Tempest that's my name the most fervent
[12:29:40] element admits every
[12:29:42] Tempest I mean electroch charges Hydro
[12:29:45] Electro is your name
[12:29:46] Electro I remember the marks that's the
[12:29:50] that I remember that marks the start of
[12:29:52] my
[12:29:55] journey

[12:30:30] is is another name which is a name for
[12:30:33] River and underworld think of sticks

[12:47:38] stood on the brink of

[12:47:43] surrender to its new
[12:47:45] master amidst it all a body decayed a
[12:47:50] pack of vultures gathered and a brother
[12:47:53] and sister were doomed for Eternal
[12:47:59] separation and so an eon succumbed to
[12:48:03] Slumber once
[12:48:05] more some celebrated this fall While

[12:48:27] dignity as the cosmos bathed in the
[12:48:30] radiance of a pure Dawn a tempestuous
[12:48:34] storm broed on the horizon the chant of

[13:11:51] all anyways that Quest was [ __ ] Peak
[13:11:55] I get why you guys like it um I will say
[13:11:58] though it is jarring how long it is like
[13:12:02] the first half I lowkey fell asleep a
[13:12:04] little I get that I was setting
[13:12:05] everything up but if I had to hear the
[13:12:07] word uh if I had to hear about the bird
[13:12:09] one more time I would have flown off my
[13:12:11] [ __ ] uh building like the bird
[13:12:16] did but like the last like the last like
[13:12:19] the second half was insane I really
[13:12:21] liked
[13:12:26] it or Memoria dude I literally drank

[13:12:42] feature before star rail moment so I'm
[13:12:44] going to milk it because this never
[13:12:45] happened so kudos to Star rail um I do
[13:12:50] wish that you could challenge this boss
[13:12:51] early without having the quest done I I
[13:12:53] get it that like you know you should do
[13:12:54] the quest but especially if it's like a
[13:12:56] 10-hour fight you don't want people to
[13:12:57] rush through it just to be able to do
[13:12:59] the boss I I get that it's like spoilers
[13:13:01] or whatever but like you don't want
[13:13:03] people to rush through a quest skipping
[13:13:05] everything just cuz they need the mat
[13:13:06] that's my opinion like well that's why
[13:13:08] genin has it too genin you could say
