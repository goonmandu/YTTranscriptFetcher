[00:46:29] live stream I think we're gonna get to
[00:46:31] see really cool characters nice
[00:46:32] abilities and I personally am excited
[00:46:34] hopefully a fun event maybe Co-op end
[00:46:36] game raid content that would be great
[00:46:38] that's for sure gonna happen in a like a
[00:46:40] RPG game that's not happening but you
[00:46:42] know what what do you guys think
[00:46:45] ah
[00:46:49] yo imagine they announced hsrtcg imagine
[00:46:53] 141 live stream TCG is coming
[00:46:57] w
[00:47:00] okay dude Auto Battle is actually
[00:47:01] [ __ ] stupid let me stop it it's
[00:47:03] killing the ads like it just altered
[00:47:08] this guy's a 1hp
[00:47:13] I'm planning here oh
[00:47:16] um
[00:47:18] this is good but against kokolio of this
[00:47:22] doctor's rope
[00:47:25] hell yeah brother
[00:47:27] boom
[00:47:28] that could be that could be good that
[00:47:31] could be good next one
[00:47:36] it's good we're using it okay so the
[00:47:38] main reason I'm doing this is because I
[00:47:40] don't have a Quantum ball for my ceiling
[00:47:42] I have none so this is technically my
[00:47:44] new best slot however these are the
[00:47:47] worst substance possible oh we got
[00:47:50] [ __ ]
[00:47:52] literally they were okay actually it
[00:47:54] might still be good so let's say
[00:47:55] hypothetically let's say hypothetically
[00:47:58] that every time we touched
[00:48:00] I got this feeling and every time we
[00:48:02] kissed I swear I could fly okay listen
[00:48:05] this isn't this gets crit or attack or
[00:48:07] speed we're happy actually speed would
[00:48:09] suck but
[00:48:11] [ __ ] it
[00:48:14] [ __ ] chat
[00:48:15] like what happened to my auto ad
[00:48:18] little bro is on copium I'm out of
[00:48:21] copium it's a good main stat

[00:48:53] gonna Flex look at how good our [ __ ]
[00:48:55] other balls are look at these balls look
[00:48:57] at [ __ ] uh this ball look at
[00:48:59] [ __ ] where is it this ball but
[00:49:01] then our Quantum one and this okay we
[00:49:03] crafted one in the battle pass main side
[00:49:05] it was like that I threw it now we got
[00:49:07] another one but now I'm smart enough to
[00:49:09] know not to throw it because main
[00:49:10] thoughts are important

[01:34:33] go
[01:34:35] what is international codes the codes
[01:34:37] are different from from Chinese
[01:34:39] if they delayed a live stream for
[01:34:41] [ __ ] codes I'm gonna
[01:34:44] there has to be a reason
[01:34:46] just give
[01:34:48] give just
[01:34:52] though when you jump on the ground
[01:34:58] um
[01:35:02] what the [ __ ] is this
[01:35:09] they probably don't have the vid yet

[01:35:41] like sure and like I'm sympathetic to
[01:35:43] that situation but how does that have

[01:35:47] China didn't get delayed if they're like
[01:35:49] okay we care about this we're gonna
[01:35:50] delay everything they would delay China
[01:35:51] too
[01:36:00] [Music]
[01:36:02] because of the code maybe I guess
[01:36:06] but I feel like this
[01:36:08] that has to be copier okay and also
[01:36:10] China has
[01:36:17] like if you think back again so like
[01:36:18] okay let's say there's like n a Japanese
[01:36:21] okay if there's a problem in Korea would
[01:36:23] they delay the other two
[01:36:25] else

[01:50:29] make this to where they could literally
[01:50:30] make it a good PR move for themselves if
[01:50:33] all they do literally all they need to
[01:50:35] do is just oh compensation here's a

[01:50:40] genshin could never and then boom they
[01:50:41] win again literally that's all they need

[02:23:46] [ __ ] throw
[02:23:58] one more I probably shouldn't plus 15
[02:24:00] this it's a pretty big like XP waste but

[02:24:29] our other one
[02:24:30] our other one is
[02:24:33] yeah wow our other one I thought was
[02:24:35] really good but I guess it's not even
[02:24:36] like not even as good it's still good
[02:24:39] but damn dude our dancing's insane look
[02:24:41] at this look at this ball okay we don't
[02:24:43] talk about the Rope Rope is like a work
[02:24:45] in progress right ropes are hard to get
[02:24:46] it is what it is but then our boots
[02:24:48] sheesh our body four star but sheesh are
[02:24:51] our gloves kind of bad
[02:24:54] okay flower is also kind of bad
[02:24:56] um but I I I'll get a better one at some
[02:24:58] point
[02:25:03] it's fine it's a work in progress we
[02:25:05] might go two-piece musk anyways it's
[02:25:07] fine
[02:25:07] two-piece Musketeer
[02:25:10] it's all good
[02:25:14] [Music]
[02:25:20] [Music]
[02:25:24] okay
[02:25:25] wait I should probably
[02:25:27] um
[02:25:28] okay well there goes all the dailies
[02:25:31] somehow
[02:25:34] okay we should probably do a dumb
[02:25:36] mistake and synthesize all our five
[02:25:37] stars because I'm addicted
[02:25:40] let's do that
[02:25:42] Salvage Salvage Salvage Salvage
[02:25:45] salvage anything that's not locked we're
[02:25:47] gonna be like
[02:25:48] [Music]
[02:25:54] for 20 I think
[02:25:58] oh yeah easy 20 easy 20.
[02:26:04] strongbox incident it's only an incident
[02:26:06] if we get unlucky it's only an incident
[02:26:08] if we're dumb
[02:26:10] and I know this is a smart investment so
[02:26:13] it's not an incident watch
[02:26:16] but what's that should we do I'm not I
[02:26:18] want to do this side but I probably
[02:26:19] shouldn't so let's do like
[02:26:22] uh maybe a silly piece because this
[02:26:24] domain's inefficient as [ __ ]
[02:26:38] wait what piece do we need we need a
[02:26:40] silly
[02:26:42] I think we need head
[02:26:45] maybe body
[02:26:51] [ __ ] it I'm doing one
[02:26:55] oh no I mean
[02:26:57] lock it it'll be good we can roll it
[02:27:01] uh and then we'll do
[02:27:05] I think our body sucks but the odds of
[02:27:07] us getting a criterate body are is
[02:27:09] really [ __ ] slim but I guess crit
[02:27:10] damage is fine too
[02:27:22] what else could we do
[02:27:30] that was it buddy fine
[02:27:32] Paul chap
[02:27:34] stop donor Walling no I didn't check
[02:27:38] stop don't know Walling what do you mean

[02:31:27] well it's nine but my laptop is on the
[02:31:29] wrong time for some reason yeah it's
[02:31:31] [ __ ]
[02:31:33] they didn't say why like they didn't
[02:31:34] update it
[02:31:36] Saj
[02:31:38] you know
[02:31:42] I wish they would give an ETA like I
[02:31:44] guess they don't know I'm gonna go to
[02:31:45] the benefits of the doubt they probably
[02:31:46] don't know but still I they should say
[02:31:48] like
[02:31:50] they should say if it's today or
[02:31:51] tomorrow or in a week or in a few hours
[02:31:53] like they don't have to say like it's in
[02:31:56] an hour they could just tell us like
[02:31:58] like uh estimate like today or sometime
[02:32:01] today will update you and they're just
[02:32:03] saying nothing that's fine they sent us
[02:32:05] a three-hour delay why did they say that
[02:32:07] why was everyone being like three hours
[02:32:09] where did you guys get that like I don't
[02:32:10] I believe you but from where like I need
[02:32:13] to know
[02:32:16] started the three hour rumor
[02:32:20] we were making it up okay
[02:32:24] you know what chalky I thought you were
[02:32:25] a good chatter
[02:32:38] yeah like I don't fault them I'm sure
[02:32:41] there's a valid reason it's just like I
[02:32:42] wish they would tell us yo what's up
[02:32:44] darling's the rain yo low-key I was like
[02:32:46] about to end
[02:32:47] Loki but I appreciate it

[02:32:52] [ __ ] the live stream is I'm kind of
[02:32:54] tilted because life's gonna happen
[02:32:57] then it it was like not working so we
[02:32:59] solve the cn1 but then the second one
[02:33:01] wasn't working for me because my I was
[02:33:03] using Google Chrome and I wouldn't load
[02:33:05] it so I should just change browsers but
[02:33:06] I didn't know that so I unplugged my
[02:33:07] router into my stream crash and then I
[02:33:09] came back and then I figured out that
[02:33:10] that wasn't
[02:33:20] hahaha
