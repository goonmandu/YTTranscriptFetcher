[00:11:20] sleep schedule but I'm live so [ __ ] you
[00:11:23] guys why am I live because Blade's here
[00:11:25] and when Blade's here I'm here and I'm
[00:11:26] excited because Blade's here so I want
[00:11:28] to play blade I want to play Star rail
[00:11:30] we're gonna do that uh uh uh today
[00:11:34] eight Lex chill there's a five I'll let
[00:11:37] you think it's a aloe tree there's a
[00:11:39] seven
[00:11:41] um
[00:11:45] first things first I should talk about
[00:11:47] this it's not that you care but if you
[00:11:49] do our blade guide is out
[00:11:52] it's pretty POG I like it people like it
[00:11:55] you like it I like it go watch it if you
[00:11:58] want uh a few things in case you care
[00:12:01] that I care about that I'm gonna talk
[00:12:03] about
[00:12:04] um
[00:12:06] I
[00:12:10] you
[00:12:11] YouTube studio is dog [ __ ] but I
[00:12:15] managed I noticed that at some point I
[00:12:18] said uh it's nothing okay like all of
[00:12:19] it's good go watch it but at some point
[00:12:21] I just I think I said um
[00:12:25] I said okay in my edited in my editing
[00:12:28] right I I said I I was recording and I
[00:12:31] said
[00:12:33] I could actually pull it up I have proof
[00:12:35] I said Brandy gives attack crit damage
[00:12:38] crit rate then I was like [ __ ] she's
[00:12:39] gonna create then I re-recorded it but
[00:12:41] then I used the wrong version and I was
[00:12:43] like [ __ ] I used the wrong version let
[00:12:44] me change it and then we forgot to
[00:12:46] change it but it's fine I cut it out it
[00:12:47] doesn't you can't see it in the video
[00:12:49] because once I uploaded it I noted it
[00:12:51] like someone comments like oh what the
[00:12:52] [ __ ] and then I turned it out so you
[00:12:53] guys can't tell now but for the first
[00:12:55] hour it was there I removed it and I
[00:12:57] also at some point said 40 instead of 20
[00:13:00] for this not at the start but just near
[00:13:02] the end but then I cut that out too so
[00:13:03] you can't even tell
[00:13:07] just a misspeak it didn't actually
[00:13:09] change anything but I want to be anytime
[00:13:12] there's even a small mistake I feel like
[00:13:14] the scum of the earth so I try to do
[00:13:16] whatever I can to avoid mistakes so I I
[00:13:17] I kind of fixed it so if you notice that
[00:13:20] in the first like hour or two then
[00:13:22] that's why
[00:13:24] um
[00:13:27] I try not to edit videos once they're
[00:13:29] uploaded though because it's like weird
[00:13:30] but if I notice like if it's like
[00:13:31] important or I noticed like as soon as I
[00:13:33] upload then I yeah
[00:13:36] um and I probably say blade hits
[00:13:37] adjacent allies yeah but I think okay
[00:13:39] that one I wrote enemies on screen
[00:13:40] though like that's something that I I
[00:13:42] fixed during editing it's not like an
[00:13:44] accident
[00:13:45] I don't know where it was but I
[00:13:46] literally wrote like great job holding
[00:13:49] yourself accountable I no longer think
[00:13:51] of you as a war criminal
[00:13:53] what
[00:13:57] I am that's why like I know for guys
[00:14:00] like this if I get it out like this guy
[00:14:01] was two days late other lady was like
[00:14:03] two days old by then I know if I Rush a
[00:14:06] video out it'll do better but I and if I
[00:14:08] don't make it 26 minutes but like I
[00:14:10] don't I just wanted to you know like I
[00:14:12] want to give information and I want it
[00:14:14] to be good so like anytime there's even
[00:14:15] a slight mistake it like hurts me I'm
[00:14:17] like [ __ ] so I I try to I fixed it like
[00:14:19] it's good you can't even like it I could
[00:14:21] cut it we're all good but still yo all I
[00:14:24] said is a 25 I appreciate it
[00:14:26] Ireland part is wrong okay the only
[00:14:28] other thing is in Ireland's lycone I
[00:14:30] said higher instead of lower but in the
[00:14:32] pin comment
[00:14:33] I wrote that and it also doesn't matter
[00:14:36] like look I'm all for being taking
[00:14:39] accountability I said the word lower
[00:14:42] instead of higher which was my bad but
[00:14:44] the whole explanation was still true and
[00:14:46] the whole weapon ranking was still true
[00:14:47] and it's all fine so it's all good but
[00:14:49] yeah and so I put down a pin
[00:14:51] this is copium this doesn't matter but
[00:14:53] this is
[00:14:58] anyways that's all
[00:15:01] um so yeah I just want to yeah so it's
[00:15:02] out the rest is pretty POG very POG I do
[00:15:04] teams I have to cut like five minutes
[00:15:06] from teams dude I talked for so long I
[00:15:09] have to cut it I have to cut it I I

[00:15:13] reduce that I started giving tips to a
[00:15:15] silver wolf I'm like you know usually
[00:15:16] with sort of you can like implant bugs

[00:15:20] as like a sub GPS with blade you Loki

[00:23:14] [ __ ] everything hydropol arm canned
[00:23:18] I'm too good okay that I think that's
[00:23:20] that uh let's do the let's look at this
[00:23:23] let me restart my webcam because if it's
[00:23:25] good I don't know what the Banners are
[00:23:27] I'm actually not looking at but if it's
[00:23:28] POG maybe a YouTube short if not no so
[00:23:31] let me turn my actual webcam on
[00:23:35] um
[00:23:36] let's see if it's okay I see donut and
[00:23:38] okay
[00:23:41] Mrs water
[00:23:49] all right new weapon banners
[00:23:52] oh sorry new engine banners first of all
[00:23:55] kokomi and Wanderer
[00:23:58] wait should I move my webcam does it
[00:24:00] block them no that's fine
[00:24:02] wait is my okay even centered wait
[00:24:11] why is my lighting so [ __ ] what if I
[00:24:12] shove this light on me
[00:24:14] oh my God I'm blinded blinded Hawk Out
[00:24:17] watch your eyes okay sorry uh anyways
[00:24:22] so what is this
[00:24:24] uh cocoli scarra we knew that Paul
[00:24:28] fricker call me combination also
[00:24:30] fontanza region and you can walk on
[00:24:31] water so pull for kokomi
[00:24:37] pretty decent
[00:24:38] I'll probably
[00:24:39] starts recent he's I he wishes he was
[00:24:41] child but he's cool I like scarra I
[00:24:43] enjoy him I need my main farzan
[00:24:45] very good with wander and very good with
[00:24:47] Xiao so if you're in a Nemo main yeah
[00:24:49] get farzans also I've said this before
[00:24:52] but far is on
[00:24:53] is like
[00:24:55] far is like a toothbrush now farzan at
[00:24:59] C6
[00:25:00] is like a fully functioning toothbrush
[00:25:02] you can brush your teeth and it's like
[00:25:03] wow I can't live without this how was I
[00:25:06] just using two things before but as far
[00:25:07] as on c0 she's still good
[00:25:10] but she's like a a toothpick with
[00:25:13] toothpaste on it it's it's better than
[00:25:15] using your finger but it's not as
[00:25:18] efficient as a toothbrush it's not even
[00:25:20] close and once you have the toothbrush
[00:25:22] you're like dude I can never go back to
[00:25:24] the toothpick so that's the difference
[00:25:25] between c0 and c65 is on for those of
[00:25:27] you wondering but even c0 she's fine
[00:25:29] she's better than nothing you still want
[00:25:30] to use her she's still underrated with
[00:25:32] child scarra but C6 that's when she
[00:25:35] becomes a toothbrush Rosaria very good
[00:25:37] also C2 is really good and then I think
[00:25:39] C3 c35 gives burst on Rosaria I'm gonna
[00:25:42] guess three but I'm gonna look it up
[00:25:43] Rosaria cons
[00:25:53] it's five it's five
[00:25:57] C five
[00:25:59] gives birth damage but C3 is the C2 is
[00:26:01] the main one for duration but true that
[00:26:02] is good
[00:26:07] she's cool I like
[00:26:09] she's okay
[00:26:11] um the thing with the headphones like
[00:26:12] she's not you know 430ps we want a user
[00:26:14] user you know but at C4 she can be a
[00:26:18] pyro shielder if you want to play a
[00:26:21] shank not changing if you want to play
[00:26:23] who Tau double pyro VV Vape team
[00:26:27] that works
[00:26:31] so yeah that's those two characters
[00:26:34] um personally I think kokomi is is
[00:26:36] actually pretty good for your account
[00:26:36] depending on which Hydro 5 size you have
[00:26:39] uh like I know you don't like if you
[00:26:41] have like Mona in your free team you
[00:26:42] don't need a kokomi but I also know
[00:26:44] people who play ayaka with Mona and
[00:26:46] they're like my existence is pain
[00:26:47] because I don't have kokomi so it
[00:26:49] depends on you I'm a kokomi enjoy your
[00:26:51] scar is pretty cool so you do you
[00:26:54] [Music]
[00:26:59] not
[00:27:04] it's a roller coaster
[00:27:07] uh it's a roller coaster so first of all
[00:27:09] dragon's Bane has been on every single
[00:27:12] banner to ever [ __ ] live ever so it's
[00:27:15] a good spear it's not bad it has its
[00:27:19] user but every dude if you've pulled on
[00:27:21] any weapon matter you probably have a
[00:27:22] dragon's Bane you probably have like 18.
[00:27:25] the Bell is complete and utter garbage
[00:27:28] I can use it on my HP Dan no you can't
[00:27:31] yes you can but it's not good lines were
[00:27:34] is good but it's an old ass weapon
[00:27:35] everyone has it and there's better
[00:27:37] options but it's not bad
[00:27:39] five was really good but you also got
[00:27:41] one for free but it's still really good
[00:27:43] wine and song
[00:27:47] I only know this is called wine and song
[00:27:49] because last time I was on a weapon I
[00:27:51] have to look it up what the [ __ ] is what
[00:27:53] is wine and song
[00:27:56] donut is pretty IDC
[00:28:00] not as pretty as you hey my name's ziox
[00:28:04] I uh I'm a gentian streamer uh people
[00:28:07] say I look like Jungkook not right now I
[00:28:08] didn't shower today because I was I was
[00:28:10] out saving children from a burning
[00:28:11] building but yeah so that if if you ever
[00:28:15] like
[00:28:18] that's the Trap that's actually what
[00:28:22] that sorry
[00:28:31] donut being pretty is propaganda from
[00:28:34] Big donut okay big big
[00:28:37] donut wants you to pull for for this
[00:28:41] weapon because it's pretty and it
[00:28:42] matches kokomi's aesthetic
[00:28:45] but real kokomi fans know that kokomi
[00:28:48] doesn't support consumerism and kokomi
[00:28:51] wants you to use the thrilling Tales
[00:28:53] she's perfectly happy
[00:28:55] without her donut
[00:29:04] why did Fang leave
[00:29:08] uh and then remembrance
[00:29:17] um
[00:29:24] I mean
[00:29:27] it's a weapon
[00:29:30] ah it is a bell it is the bell too true
[00:29:35] it's uh it's it's good for scar good for
[00:29:37] normal attackers
[00:29:41] outside of that
[00:29:58] I'm trying to think like why would I
[00:30:00] want this weapon let me [ __ ] am I
[00:30:02] missing something tele Tolo it's
[00:30:04] remembrance
[00:30:07] a lot yeah you can also just use lost
[00:30:09] prayer or Atlas or solar Pearl or with
[00:30:11] sit there's a lot of good four-star
[00:30:14] catalysts
[00:30:15] ah yeah yeah I mean it's
[00:30:20] 44 wait I mean the basic I mean
[00:30:26] what's it just cringe to use your cringe
[00:30:28] to use sorry that was toxic
[00:30:30] yeah I mean I'm gonna be real
[00:30:33] uh I wouldn't really recommend this
[00:30:36] weapon Banner this is
[00:30:39] yeah also as someone in chat pointed out
[00:30:42] which I was gonna mention but then for
[00:30:43] Gore
[00:30:44] the way you place guard like kind of
[00:30:47] changes how good this weapon is like if
[00:30:48] you're spam normal attacking then it's
[00:30:50] it's good but if your charge attack
[00:30:51] stepping you don't even get the stat box
[00:30:53] so it's not good so it depends on what
[00:30:55] you're doing this can be better there
[00:30:57] are no four stars present or just go for
[00:31:00] C2 Wanderer
[00:31:17] sorry I distracted
[00:31:23] it's not even better yeah it depends on
[00:31:25] your rotation it's it's often times not
[00:31:27] as best and Slot which is [ __ ]
[00:31:30] but yeah I mean it depends it
[00:31:36] yeah anyways I wouldn't regret this one
[00:31:38] but this isn't going to be made into a
[00:31:39] video by the way I just because it's so
[00:31:41] bad I'm not [ __ ] uploading this it's
[00:31:42] just it's yeah it's it's [ __ ] Bell
[00:31:45] sucks balls these two weapons are like
[00:31:47] incredibly Niche and even in their Niche
[00:31:49] it's like why and as someone in chat

[00:35:22] I said I was gonna stream yesterday I
[00:35:23] couldn't life all good actually it was
[00:35:25] because of the blade video uh but I did
[00:35:27] if you [ __ ] okay as I thought
[00:35:30] I did preform offstream now
[00:35:34] winter HP on bladewind now

[00:35:39] you might be like socks there's no
[00:35:41] [ __ ] way you got something good off
[00:35:42] stream well I got a crit damage body I
[00:35:46] didn't okay I didn't level anything I
[00:35:48] just locked a bunch of pieces so we're
[00:35:49] gonna roll them together but I got a
[00:35:50] crit damage body with crit rate and I
[00:35:52] think a fear something and it was plus
[00:35:54] zero and I had four stats I'm like what
[00:35:56] the [ __ ] Pepe W but then I rolled it and
[00:35:59] it didn't hit crit rate a single time
[00:36:01] now it hit HP
[00:36:03] but it also hit defense
[00:36:06] um so I don't like it's not useless
[00:36:11] because it has HP you know it has a it
[00:36:14] has a great role effect res is good but
[00:36:17] defenses yeah
[00:36:20] um

[00:38:29] stream
[00:38:32] uh and a lot of these are kid level but
[00:38:34] the only my only problem is I don't know
[00:38:37] if I need crit damage or criterate
[00:38:40] because we didn't we don't actually have
[00:38:42] them built yet built in
[00:38:47] Bill tin

[00:38:52] um

[00:52:00] uh socks what's Blade's best f2p team
[00:52:07] uh I covered that in my last video
[00:52:09] exclamation mark new vid exclamation
[00:52:10] mark YouTube
[00:52:12] content I but you can go uh Pila Natasha
[00:52:17] and then Flex Harmony support which is
[00:52:19] usually like if you're free to play it's
[00:52:20] like asked or some [ __ ] but
[00:52:23] um there's like there's better ones but
[00:52:24] it depends on who you have usually okay
[00:52:27] blade usually wait let me change the
[00:52:29] thing from extra music YouTube to extra
[00:52:30] new vid uh new
[00:52:36] blade themes you can do two things well
[00:52:38] you can do a few things you can fit them
[00:52:39] any [ __ ] team ever but usually
[00:52:42] there's two things you can do either you
[00:52:43] do blade Harmony healer or blade healer
[00:52:48] then another DPS and then either
[00:52:50] nihility or Harmony so like you can
[00:52:52] either do double DPS if you just want to
[00:52:54] or have another DPS that you can use and
[00:52:55] like you can be a standalone unit
[00:52:58] or you build a team around them that's
[00:53:00] just like Pila or whatever and then like
[00:53:02] brania Ting Yoon yukong [ __ ] Asta and
[00:53:07] then a Healer but you need a Healer
[00:53:08] though don't go Shield if you go
[00:53:10] shielder if you play a shield or with
[00:53:12] blade he will come in your room at 3am
[00:53:15] and find you don't call the Imposter at

[00:53:56] why she also does give you a small
[00:53:57] Shields but you do take damage but then
[00:53:59] it's like you don't want to taunt

[01:14:07] disassociation damage
[01:14:10] one
[01:14:26] easy all right it's not as easy as that
[01:14:28] boys it's as easy as that boom watch
[01:14:31] this
[01:14:32] I mean that's
[01:14:35] gonna be
[01:14:38] what do you even want I don't know
[01:14:40] that's fine speed HP it's gonna be good
[01:14:43] on like
[01:14:47] I mean it's final like Lucha I guess I
[01:14:49] mean that's fine
[01:14:55] Oh wait [ __ ] this is good error nice
[01:15:10] HP rope I haven't seen that at all since
[01:15:12] pulling blade dude [ __ ] same I almost
[01:15:14] want to use my like modulated uh uh uh
[01:15:18] like like piece or whatever the [ __ ]
[01:15:20] it's called on it
[01:15:21] the one you get from the battle pass
[01:15:33] this one so what are you even goblet
[01:15:34] Flex is it I mean is this a fox wait
[01:15:36] which one's which one's my biggest sucks
[01:15:38] probably yanchi I mean
[01:15:40] I think we're damage kind of a flex six
[01:15:42] percent crit rate damage also a flex
[01:15:46] we don't have like the best goblets in
[01:15:48] this game
[01:15:51] Yuan one uh uh I mean
[01:15:57] this one's good this is a really good
[01:15:59] win one but it's on Space stealing so
[01:16:00] it's fighter like that hunger or
[01:16:01] whatever but uh blade doesn't really
[01:16:03] want it
[01:16:07] okay not to be a gearing Gary but let me
[01:16:10] at least give
[01:16:13] let me at least give the new two-piece
[01:16:15] to some people uh
[01:16:21] uh should we give it to branya probably
[01:16:24] right here you get 16 for damage which
[01:16:26] isn't more but the other one gives it to
[01:16:28] all allies
[01:16:29] could also give it two but we need to
[01:16:30] factorized we can also give it to a
[01:16:31] Healer we give it to like
[01:16:40] yeah we give it to her
[01:16:42] um
[01:16:45] do you have a HP ball we do
[01:16:50] is it worth anything for blades I go to
[01:16:51] secret valve good enough secret house
[01:16:53] good enough
[01:16:55] I also don't really so I generally don't
[01:16:58] advise weapon matters in genshin but in
[01:17:01] this game
[01:17:02] in my mind it makes less sense because
[01:17:04] you don't even see the weapon it's a
[01:17:05] light cone
[01:17:07] it's like you're pulling for an NFD
[01:17:10] like it's you can't even like
[01:17:14] can't even see it
[01:17:18] oh my yo why is this only rolling crit
[01:17:21] damage bro wait that's good for Brian
[01:17:25] that's so good that's actually so good
[01:17:26] that's actually so good
[01:17:33] also I don't like how Auto ad is adding
[01:17:34] the new set first why does it do that
[01:17:40] you need to factorize I do need some
[01:17:42] effectras
[01:17:43] wait how much do I have uh oh I don't
[01:17:45] know how much effect as I have I might
[01:17:48] have zero
[01:17:53] oh my [ __ ] bro what
[01:18:00] bro what is this
[01:18:02] this [ __ ] is staying on bronya the hell
[01:18:07] she got some from traces oh I have a
[01:18:10] little bit of information about my
[01:18:12] Harmony character's traces yeah oh I
[01:18:14] mean it's not even that bad but yeah ah
[01:18:18] yeah so this will get unlocked at some
[01:18:21] point
[01:18:23] um
[01:18:28] yeah
[01:18:30] boy I look you have enough
[01:18:33] like if I have green ones
[01:18:37] Max the piece dude it's it's okay a
[01:18:39] waste of artifact takes two though
[01:18:41] like it's good but is it really worth
[01:18:43] maxing
[01:18:50] sorry Relic XP
[01:18:53] actually relics it's not artifacts
[01:18:56] that's the factors
[01:19:08] does Rania want HP she doesn't want HP
[01:19:10] but she doesn't not want HP so we go HP
[01:19:12] then I'll die does that make sense
[01:19:13] because like I don't really care about
[01:19:16] her attack I just care about her crit
[01:19:17] damage
[01:19:22] oh wait why did I go HP wait
[01:19:28] did I get er am I not got any Aria oh I
[01:19:30] did okay cool cool well I'll keep the HP
[01:19:33] one for someone else I'll lock it
[01:19:35] that's fine we will use on someone else
[01:19:36] oh this one
[01:19:41] okay I mean subsets don't really matter
[01:19:50] four star I can't you try getting a
[01:19:53] error rope this is impossible
[01:19:57] why are you I can't think of four star
[01:19:59] it's fine dude it's fine okay ignore I
[01:20:03] don't know what the [ __ ] our set is
[01:20:04] right now our body is like neglected I'm
[01:20:06] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry bronya I'm
[01:20:08] sorry bronia
[01:20:10] um
[01:20:14] like we could go out at least the two
[01:20:15] piece of this arguably the four but at
[01:20:17] least the two
[01:20:21] this has a factory as how much effectors
[01:20:23] do I have right now we need uh
[01:20:28] I probably have like 10.
[01:20:30] actress 17. so we need we need 13 more
[01:20:35] this gives us six
[01:20:40] yo am I gonna get this though be honest
[01:20:45] [ __ ] it
[01:20:48] [ __ ] it we ball
[01:21:07] you're too late to start playing Star
[01:21:09] rail now why would it be too late
[01:21:11] Blade's batter literally just came out
[01:21:13] get Blade be happy you're welcome
[01:21:17] people I'll say that a lot with genshin
[01:21:19] too it's like listen okay I'm just being
[01:21:22] honest
[01:21:24] lengthening your strength it's not like
[01:21:26] people are progressing
[01:21:29] like you might like be like oh like I
[01:21:31] don't want to start this because like
[01:21:32] everyone's raiding and they're have like
[01:21:34] amazing gear I'll never catch up it's
[01:21:36] like you can once you get to 412 once
[01:21:39] you beat memory of chaos once you where
[01:21:41] are you going
[01:21:43] lengthening your strength
[01:21:54] it's single player PVE okay yeah exactly
[01:22:00] wait can you co-opt in this game I've
[01:22:03] never tried or looked I know you can
[01:22:05] borrow characters and [ __ ]
[01:22:08] no you can't because it's a [ __ ] it's
[01:22:10] like a like a art it's like a it's a
[01:22:12] type of game called I mean it's turn
[01:22:13] based but I guess they just borrow
[01:22:17] um
[01:22:19] like I guess it makes sense to not have
[01:22:22] it but still sad
[01:22:32] okay listen
[01:22:35] to the free to play players that keep
[01:22:38] asking me if they should keep pulling
[01:22:40] for blade or save for Kafka
[01:22:42] dude I think they're both Peak designs
[01:22:45] so just pick your [ __ ] favorite and
[01:22:46] pull for that one
[01:22:49] just choose which one you like more
[01:22:54] yeah Blade's definitely good but like if
[01:22:57] you're like Kafka transcends star rail
[01:23:00] like I I know some nor I have some
[01:23:03] Normie friends who who are into Kafka
[01:23:05] but don't know anything about star rail
[01:23:07] that's all I'm gonna say
[01:23:09] that's all I'm gonna say
[01:23:16] I should have to synthesize whatever uh
[01:23:19] where's what am I looking for
[01:23:21] [ __ ] away looking forward traces traces
[01:23:33] I need eight purples right
[01:23:37] wow exactly enough
[01:23:39] and then we need some of these
[01:23:42] well I actually have enough it's [ __ ]
[01:23:43] surprising
[01:23:46] hello Mr socks yo chat hello
[01:23:51] what's up didn't see it
[01:24:00] 21. can you do something for me
[01:24:03] uh
[01:24:07] uh am I really getting six effect res
[01:24:09] over this CR
[01:24:11] AP [ __ ] it I don't care I just want to
[01:24:13] be able to use the set because if I
[01:24:14] can't use the sad people are gonna laugh
[01:24:15] at me okay so how much do we have now
[01:24:19] 24 23. so we need seven
[01:24:23] uh uh let's level this piece let's level
[01:24:28] this piece
[01:24:30] well at least go the two piece
[01:24:32] as well
[01:24:35] oh my what the hey Okay let's get it to
[01:24:39] nine let's get to nine because we want
[01:24:41] to be tanky
[01:24:45] okay well we have enough now I don't
[01:24:47] even need more effectras
[01:24:55] that could be really good on healers too
[01:24:56] healers like effectors a lot
[01:24:58] um
[01:25:01] yeah I mean I guess bronya likes it too
[01:25:03] so that she can like cleanse people
[01:25:04] without getting [ __ ] stuck
[01:25:07] step bro so uh that's fine we probably
[01:25:10] want
[01:25:12] one with crit damage here
[01:25:14] or like I could also just level one with
[01:25:16] HP and then Flex it to another character
[01:25:18] but
[01:25:25] I roll the crit damage yo what the [ __ ]
[01:25:28] I roll a blade piece I get unlucky I
[01:25:33] roll a bunch of support pieces I keep
[01:25:34] getting lucky the [ __ ] this is actually
[01:25:37] like Vermillion again every other set's
[01:25:39] gonna be lucky I'm not complaining oh

[01:26:00] doesn't matter it doesn't matter it
[01:26:02] doesn't matter what half a plus 12.
[01:26:04] uh I mean we use this for now
[01:26:08] if this isn't on anyone we might as well
[01:26:09] [ __ ] use it whatever
[01:26:12] sure
[01:26:22] wait why am I doing this place plus nine
[01:26:24] I
[01:26:25] said what the [ __ ] are my relics I'm
[01:26:27] gonna Plus I'm not actually decide
[01:26:30] something funnier this way
[01:26:35] what is their crit ratio it's bronya I
[01:26:37] don't need her to crit
[01:26:43] um
[01:26:47] okay I think we're I want to go memory
[01:26:49] of chaos so I'm trying to make sure the
[01:26:50] characters I'm gonna use okay her okay
[01:26:52] yeah our silver was kind of scuffed I
[01:26:55] doesn't matter she's a good support even
[01:26:57] with nothing it's fine but
[01:27:02] but it's actually not even bad this
[01:27:04] shouldn't be plus six though it's
[01:27:05] actually not even bad
[01:27:22] oh I have a free pool
[01:27:24] fog

[01:34:36] and now we will craft some some some
[01:34:38] boots for our ceiling we're gonna do two
[01:34:41] at a time and we're gonna get an attack
[01:34:43] one
[01:34:45] foreign

[01:35:30] we are getting attack
[01:35:33] we are getting attack no longer would my
[01:35:36] Sealy be a joke no longer will she be a
[01:35:39] laughing stock no longer
[01:35:42] no longer feet
[01:35:47] are you
[01:35:59] I didn't even see what it was
[01:36:04] oh
[01:36:07] I thought that was your damage hey
[01:36:09] what was the other one though what was
[01:36:11] the one we missed is he drinking coffee
[01:36:12] at 3am it's 4 am and I usually sleep at
[01:36:15] this time I don't know what I'm doing my
[01:36:17] life is a calm I used to think my life
[01:36:20] was a tragedy no okay where's the
[01:36:23] where's the wait wait what Booth did we
[01:36:25] miss
[01:36:26] it was defense but at least hey
[01:36:29] surely it's better than the [ __ ]
[01:36:31] star boots we're using right now
[01:36:34] 500 gifted if it isn't
[01:36:52] probably why okay it's still better it's
[01:36:56] still better because the attack just
[01:36:58] that means that it's still better it's
[01:37:00] still better I don't owe you guys
[01:37:02] anything it's still technically better
[01:37:04] because the stats are higher eh I made a
[01:37:06] bet I couldn't lose I made a bet I
[01:37:08] couldn't lose but that is a [ __ ]
[01:37:10] atrocious I can't believe that's a real
[01:37:12] piece
[01:37:14] wow
[01:37:17] holy [ __ ] how
[01:37:23] [ __ ] man
[01:37:27] our gloves are really good could damage
[01:37:29] attack really good our flower our our
[01:37:31] house
[01:37:33] are our Quantum hat do we have one
[01:37:38] I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I
[01:37:41] mean
[01:38:00] maybe a silver wolf piece unironically
[01:38:06] if it rolls if it spam screw damage
[01:38:08] silly if it doesn't silver wolf
[01:38:13] it could still have crew damage though
[01:38:23] mouse trap
[01:38:27] wall strap
[01:38:31] 666 monkey W both traps not bad not bad
[01:38:36] it's not like amazing but we could use
[01:38:38] it on silly for now it's better than
[01:38:39] running this two-piece obviously this
[01:38:41] yeah it's better than running about two
[01:38:43] piece it's fine for now what is our
[01:38:44] ratio
[01:38:45] it's late not terrible because we're on
[01:38:47] the four piece actually not terrible now
[01:38:49] obviously our boots are [ __ ]
[01:38:50] atrocious and our bodies atrocious but
[01:38:53] our gloves are nice our hat is nice our
[01:38:55] RR ball is nice and our rope is nice so
[01:38:59] all we need

[01:48:40] let me know I'll just remember Castle
[01:48:42] them do you want to enter the Forgotten
[01:48:47] uh but we're very early because I only
[01:48:49] all about one to three off stream I need
[01:48:50] to go as far as I can I actually don't
[01:48:52] I've never like fully pushed it so
[01:48:54] probably this week
[01:48:56] before I resets I'll try to go all the
[01:48:57] way I don't [ __ ] know we haven't done
[01:49:00] it yet like this is gonna be easy so we
[01:49:01] can just skip to the like
[01:49:03] Auto Battle skip to the hard ones blade
[01:49:06] imaginary I mean we'll do blade
[01:49:09] I've brought another water every single
[01:49:11] floor and then we'll do Sealy silver
[01:49:13] wolf tiny and Bilu every single like no
[01:49:15] we're gonna use the answering two I
[01:49:17] think that's what we'll do

[01:49:20] Celia and blade
[01:49:22] hey bad chat I just don't have a lot
[01:49:24] last slot because my lot the other
[01:49:26] characters have I guess welt but the
[01:49:28] other good character I have is a
[01:49:29] shielder but blade doesn't want to
[01:49:30] Shield your streams are dangerous to me
[01:49:33] I spend money to send bits
[01:49:37] oh what
[01:49:40] damn

[02:41:49] here's my take apple pie is good and I
[02:41:53] like apple pie and I enjoy it a lot but
[02:41:57] I think
[02:41:59] that somehow the worst part of apple pie
[02:42:03] are the apples I think the crust is
[02:42:05] goated I think the cinnamon is nice I
[02:42:08] think like that is like warm and
[02:42:09] comforting and great but I just prefer
[02:42:12] like dude half the time they're like
[02:42:14] [ __ ] they're either like soggy or
[02:42:16] like I don't know it it's not bad
[02:42:18] they're still good I still like apple
[02:42:20] pie I just like the cross and [ __ ] more
[02:42:23] so when it's like I don't know
[02:42:33] dude I don't even dislike it it's just
[02:42:36] the worst part of it
[02:42:39] foreign

[02:43:56] um I feel like yes I like I like I like
[02:44:00] I like pecan pie
[02:44:02] I like I like uh uh uh us sometimes
[02:44:08] pumpkin pie with whipped cream is good
[02:44:10] on its own it's got a mid but the
[02:44:11] whipped cream is kind of good
[02:44:12] I like
[02:44:17] I like uh coconut cream pie that's good
[02:44:21] don't type huh it's the actual pie it's
[02:44:24] good
[02:44:26] um we can get closer
[02:44:33] yeah anyways
[02:44:35] little drunk
[02:44:38] all right let's actually [ __ ] the deer
[02:44:40] up don't listen to chat they're saying
[02:44:42] cream pie SMH
[02:44:44] wait that's the
[02:44:47] stuff someone said
[02:44:49] you should make a tick tock account and
[02:44:51] do one of those NPC lives but with
[02:44:53] genjin and HSR voice lines and then you

[02:45:05] oh that would be so good that would be
[02:45:08] so [ __ ] good that would actually be
[02:45:10] like the best take possible
[02:45:14] that was a good idea that was actually
[02:45:16] dude Chad you guys have rarely have good
[02:45:18] ideas so that was a good idea
[02:45:22] silverwolf time for a bug
[02:45:29] wait why is my bronia moving before my
[02:45:33] what's better pie or xiaow
[02:45:39] wait why does everybody have more speed
[02:45:40] I thought oh [ __ ] I said I was gonna
[02:45:42] change it that I didn't
[02:45:46] [ __ ]
[02:45:49] I literally said I was gonna change it I
[02:45:52] will dispatch
[02:45:58] dispatch [ __ ]
[02:46:02] um
[02:46:03] um
[02:46:04] more enemies
[02:46:19] pound cake is so good I love pound cake
[02:46:24] but I disagree with your take okay I
[02:46:27] think a lot of store-bought cheap cakes
[02:46:29] are so sweet that you have to scrape
[02:46:31] half the icing off for you to eat it
[02:46:33] without tasting the diabetes true but if
[02:46:35] you like bacon cake or someone bakes you
[02:46:37] a cake or you buy like an actual cake
[02:46:39] like a good cake then I think they're
[02:46:41] pretty tall tier but it's like not every
[02:46:42] like a lot of cakes are cakes are less
[02:46:45] consistent okay cakes are like the the
[02:46:48] [ __ ] cause of Genji no kings are like
[02:46:52] yeah like store-bought icing is half the
[02:46:55] time is gross I like okay I like the
[02:46:56] Betty Crocker vanilla one but a lot of
[02:46:58] times it's gross but like if you get
[02:47:00] like like cream cheese frosting or like
[02:47:02] actually good icing is good
[02:47:03] repay
[02:47:11] [Applause]
[02:47:18] you'll pay for this
[02:47:21] lengthen your strength
[02:47:23] yeah I kind of [ __ ] up my speed but

[03:50:21] I feel like the The Shred from E is more

[03:50:26] because it's also buffing the alts so I

[03:53:04] watch bailu get Frozen as she needs to
[03:53:07] rest someone or some [ __ ] ah this is

[03:53:10] um
[03:53:15] we need hasta bro we need we need hasta
[03:53:20] I've got a way to get
[03:53:38] it
[03:53:44] this is double speed
[03:53:52] don't mess with me almost we almost
[03:53:55] break this like look at how close
[03:53:58] okay if Violet if Tia dies it's fine as
[03:54:02] long as Steely doesn't die
[03:54:04] okay all right
[03:54:07] yeah yeah okay we need um we need to
[03:54:10] cleanse we need a cleanse we need a
[03:54:12] cleanse
[03:54:13] um
[03:54:14] okay well uh yeah so okay
[03:54:19] I mean we could also run fire EMC here
[03:54:34] can you in first half
[03:54:36] I'm gonna be honest if I run blade I
[03:54:38] want brawny with him but if I was
[03:54:40] running Yan Ching I don't know why I
[03:54:41] didn't just go Ting Yoon
[03:54:45] I don't know why I didn't just do that
[03:54:46] if I'm being honest
[03:54:51] I'm on this
[03:55:22] we need a cleanser though we might
[03:55:23] actually have to go [ __ ]
[03:55:25] like I want to play this team but I
[03:55:27] don't think it's worth it
[03:55:39] I mean we could do like
[03:55:42] do like this
[03:55:45] kind of curse though
[03:56:09] dude why can't I have two bronyas
[03:56:22] I guess I technically do
[03:56:32] blade wants bronya
[03:56:36] but the second team needs a cleanse
[03:57:10] we found out that class was killed the
[03:57:12] ice guy wait you actually Focus the ice
[03:57:14] guy over [ __ ] cocolia actually
[03:57:25] yeah I guess he Perma freezes you
[03:57:28] wait wait
[03:57:53] these assets level 60. I want to use her
[03:57:56] but it's kind of monkey I could use Fire
[03:57:58] FC here
[03:58:00] that our damage is kind of low
[03:58:03] us does better damage this makes sure we
[03:58:05] don't die
[03:59:01] I could
[03:59:02] and I could commit to Natasha but
[03:59:18] she's not geared my brother has the gear
[04:00:02] dude I I don't even have enough
[04:00:05] because
[04:00:26] surely this is fine
[04:00:34] I think we don't even need to watch our
[04:00:36] first half we just were hoping we inject
[04:00:38] wind into the sky but if we get the
[04:00:40] wrong one we can just reset
[04:00:42] but that's like kind of too deep into it
[04:00:44] I don't feel like resetting
[04:00:49] like we could bring launcher for the
[04:00:51] clan second and then just do bailu and
[04:00:54] then hope we don't [ __ ] inject
[04:00:55] lightning
[04:00:58] Windows yeah but that's nullified by
[04:00:59] silver wolf it doesn't matter
[04:01:01] like it sucks but someone can fix it
[04:01:04] but if we and like if we implant [ __ ]
[04:01:07] lightning then that's cope
[04:01:15] does strip enemy buff oh [ __ ] that is
[04:01:19] first half
[04:01:22] yeah true
[04:01:36] okay surely I don't need Natasha right
[04:01:45] her cleanse is good
[04:01:52] yeah I could peel a first half
[04:01:58] but then our whole team is [ __ ]
[04:02:03] because then I should play yanching not
[04:02:05] blade
[04:02:07] bro I fell asleep woke up and this guy
[04:02:09] is still streaming eagle
[04:02:43] we could do some dumb [ __ ] like yanching
[04:02:45] and Pilar or yanching and [ __ ]
[04:02:49] something and then free a cleanser for
[04:02:51] second half
[04:03:02] why is there a Gamba chat
[04:03:12] we could level our Natasha but she gets
