[00:03:00] okay
[00:03:01] also a few important disclaimers first
[00:03:04] of all we're playing in English cuz I
[00:03:05] don't want to have to read everything I
[00:03:07] want to be able to listen second of all
[00:03:09] should we have in-game music on cuz I
[00:03:11] feel like I like in game music but and
[00:03:13] this is a big butt this is like shha
[00:03:16] cave although Cave's size isn't that big
[00:03:18] but the form is kind of nice um kind of
[00:03:20] like who who else it doesn't matter but
[00:03:22] it is a big butt and the point is I
[00:03:24] don't know like the music in game is
[00:03:26] nice but it pauses sometimes like drink
[00:03:29] cut scen or like it'll be like really
[00:03:30] quiet at times so I don't know if you
[00:03:33] guys actually want
[00:03:36] that in game okay we'll turn the end
[00:03:38] game on on uh this made off it is
[00:03:40] scuffed that's why it's like yeah it's
[00:03:42] like [ __ ]

[00:04:01] anything that can be clipped while
[00:04:02] wearing this my reputation is

[00:05:05] say but sounds good oh also another
[00:05:10] important disclaimer of today's
[00:05:12] stream we are going to skip Pon dialogue

[00:05:17] to say I'm sorry if you're a Pon lover
[00:05:19] good for you I didn't ask we might like
[00:05:21] read some of it but like I I if it's an
[00:05:24] 8 Hour stream and 30 minutes of it is
[00:05:26] Pon I might as well save half an hour
[00:05:34] I see Pon dialog isn't bad in font dude
[00:05:37] Pon is literally just oh what that means
[00:05:39] is and then everything in case you
[00:05:41] didn't read if we're going to pay
[00:05:42] attention we don't need payon's [ __ ]
[00:05:44] recap as if we were 12 though now that I
[00:05:46] think about it suu wouldn't be what it
[00:05:49] is today without you seems true oh so
[00:05:52] what you're saying is we help change suu
[00:05:55] watch okay well say by toita yeah we
[00:05:58] should say bye to could have

[00:06:09] prank welcome to
[00:06:11] come goodbye byebye
[00:06:26] Samu
[00:06:27] D DB
[00:06:30] anyways we have to get to Fontan but
[00:06:33] luckily for me I could just [ __ ]
[00:06:34] teleport there okay so this is my team
[00:06:36] for the Aron Quest
[00:06:37] initially initially we had these four
[00:06:42] because Scara you know cool movement
[00:06:44] plus fun character yolan goes really
[00:06:46] fast kokomi kokomi nation and she heals
[00:06:49] us and then Shia cuz I love Shia but um
[00:06:52] I was you know I came to the I asked
[00:06:54] people in chat you guys were like dude
[00:06:55] you don't have to run that much in this
[00:06:56] Quest and if that's true then we have
[00:06:58] Scara for whatever Movement we need and
[00:06:59] we don't need Yan in which case we might
[00:07:01] as well bring Mr along just because it's
[00:07:05] Al um and yeah so this is our team we
[00:07:09] have double anemo for the the the
[00:07:10] residents and then just a Healer and
[00:07:12] then a hi them wife husband and
[00:07:14] boyfriend on one team true actually and
[00:07:17] then our [ __ ] our stubborn child our
[00:07:20] stubborn
[00:07:23] teenager put lumine in the team for
[00:07:27] immersion no
[00:07:29] hey girl are
[00:07:31] you finally made
[00:07:34] it this must be Fontaine
[00:07:36] Port wow everything looks so advanced in
[00:07:41] Fontaine I'm so I heard to seeing the S
[00:07:45] say a tourist is nice but maybe it would
[00:07:48] be better if we found something to do
[00:07:50] what do you think also
[00:07:53] okay more disclaimers before we begin
[00:07:56] more disclaimers before we begin mam F
[00:07:59] good idea gave us loads of useful
[00:08:02] information
[00:08:04] seing I haven't watched anyone play this
[00:08:07] I managed to mostly avoid spoilers the
[00:08:08] only spoiler that I got was by hoyo
[00:08:10] verse themselves when they [ __ ]
[00:08:12] showed like arino being like oh look at
[00:08:15] my children and stuff so that's the only
[00:08:17] thing that I've really seen uh like the
[00:08:20] only thing is like you
[00:08:22] know you know there's probably two
[00:08:25] [ __ ] losers that are in the fatou but
[00:08:27] that's all that's literally all that's
[00:08:28] literally all that I've
[00:08:29] uh other than that I think we're
[00:08:32] chilling I don't actually know what
[00:08:33] happens I saw the picture of like I saw
[00:08:36] the picture of of of of finina I was
[00:08:39] twist but it's a Pity that it never
[00:08:42] happened still his story is quite the
[00:08:44] tear
[00:08:48] jerker all excuse me can I help you to
[00:08:52] donated one couldn't help but notice he
[00:08:54] standing here listening what hi we're
[00:08:59] Travelers new to Fontaine and we had
[00:09:01] something we wanted to ask but you seem
[00:09:04] to be really busy talking about some
[00:09:06] kind of play so we didn't want to
[00:09:08] interrupt okay play balls oh no no no
[00:09:12] okay you guys are saying don't skip but
[00:09:14] do I really care about what iten has to
[00:09:15] say no one talks abouten the only thing
[00:09:19] that can compete with balls is made wow
[00:09:22] a real trial you were talking about it
[00:09:24] and the words you used just now made it
[00:09:26] sound like some kind of story okay well
[00:09:29] good Tales are often based on true story
[00:09:31] like thrilling T and what you see
[00:09:33] reality may also be someone deliberately
[00:09:35] putting on an act while harboring
[00:09:37] ulterior motives whether something is
[00:09:39] true or not simply isn't that important
[00:09:42] okay the main thing is whether the story
[00:09:44] being acted out he's already bored no
[00:09:46] I'm not I'm not bored I'm not bored
[00:09:47] looks like you're not
[00:09:48] from you probably don't know that the
[00:09:51] Fon court of justice is called the Opera
[00:09:53] epic or more commonly known as just the
[00:09:56] Opera House what the [ __ ] is that EP but
[00:10:00] that's too France for me I'm sorry I've
[00:10:01] never used that word in my life a more
[00:10:06] seriously question I didn't expect the
[00:10:08] outa wishing you a great stream to less
[00:10:12] usually a very serious oh look a th bits
[00:10:16] worries other visitors to Fontaine have
[00:10:18] wondered the same thing you could say
[00:10:21] that we just don't want to waste the
[00:10:22] moving stories behind those cases and as
[00:10:25] for your words about whether the cases
[00:10:26] are treated with to reverence we have
[00:10:29] the absolutely just and honorable chief
[00:10:31] justice net as well as the or I don't
[00:10:34] know why they pronounced his name like
[00:10:35] that well actually I didn't hear how she
[00:10:36] pronounced it created by the archon
[00:10:38] between the machine and the Chief
[00:10:40] Justice false charges and Injustice are
[00:10:42] a thing of the past
[00:10:45] now
[00:10:46] mechanical
[00:10:48] cardal what a [ __ ] name I'm sorry I'm
[00:10:51] sorry that's a [ __ ] terrible name is
[00:10:55] it some kind of machine too wait I
[00:10:58] almost to ask you a question um do you
[00:11:01] know what we should do if we want to
[00:11:02] meet the hydro
[00:11:04] Aran oh that's easy just go to the opera
[00:11:08] house lady finina practically lives
[00:11:10] there you could definitely say it's her
[00:11:12] biggest okay also before we meet finina
[00:11:15] and before I even have a take on her cuz
[00:11:17] I actually don't know I will say that no
[00:11:19] matter what no matter what her
[00:11:21] personality
[00:11:23] is you guys are going to sim for her
[00:11:25] because of what we saw in the trailer
[00:11:28] that's that's all I'm going to say so I
[00:11:30] like if I don't like her um I will be
[00:11:33] afraid to say anything but I haven't met
[00:11:35] her yet so I don't know I'm just saying
[00:11:36] I'm just saying hopefully she's cool I
[00:11:40] think what they mean is that they wish
[00:11:42] to speak with the archon
[00:11:45] personally in that case I'm afraid it's
[00:11:48] going to be a tad more difficult you'll
[00:11:50] have to make an appointment well in
[00:11:52] advance you can make an appointment with
[00:11:53] the [ __ ] archon not she has any time
[00:11:55] slots is she like a dentist Aron super
[00:11:58] busy taking Tak care of official stuff
[00:12:00] no no lady finina seldom takes an
[00:12:03] interest with a nation's Affairs reason
[00:12:05] it's difficult to make an appointment is
[00:12:08] simply because she's incredibly popular
[00:12:10] that's right after all she is the Aron
[00:12:14] thetic from time to time people first
[00:12:18] time P's ever heard of an archon being
[00:12:20] described dadly before meanwhile V's
[00:12:23] just running around drinking wine H get
[00:12:25] now the hydro Aran is kind of like a
[00:12:30] will probably honestly like I will I
[00:12:34] don't even know for like no leaks but if
[00:12:36] Fin's not good with Shang Ling I'd be
[00:12:39] surprised even if fen's kid is like hey
[00:12:43] just play Hydro shling is probably still
[00:12:45] good hang on this is still fontaine's
[00:12:48] archon you're talking about you should
[00:12:50] show some more respect you can [ __ ]
[00:12:52] play sh with man I guess I should at
[00:12:55] least try to be a little more respectful
[00:12:57] in front of visitors
[00:12:59] otherwise I might get arrested and find
[00:13:01] myself face to face with M net wait you
[00:13:05] just need you need to get AR wait if you
[00:13:07] get arrested n but nobody's going to be
[00:13:10] arrested for saying something yo yo how
[00:13:12] do I commit a crime kill these guys
[00:13:14] thank you at least we now know that we
[00:13:17] can find the hyro is he a is n like a
[00:13:20] tr's not a cop tr's like a judge or
[00:13:23] something long making an appointment

[00:13:50] matter she's going to jump into the
[00:13:53] water is she push her into the
[00:13:55] water get pranked Lynette you're on Tik
[00:13:57] Tok
[00:14:06] Prelude of BL
[00:14:08] and sorry I said that very
[00:14:11] CUA wait what the
[00:14:15] [ __ ] uh hello there excuse me are you
[00:14:20] all right
[00:14:22] huh ah I'm fine thanks oh you uh we just
[00:14:28] noticed that you to be worried about
[00:14:29] something about many things actually
[00:14:31] okay weird POV but all good but there's
[00:14:33] nothing I can do but just keep my
[00:14:34] troubles to myself okay I was just
[00:14:36] reminiscing about a place my brother and
[00:14:38] I would play when we were kids it was
[00:14:41] just at top that hill over there you
[00:14:43] have a brother uh you're pointing at the
[00:14:47] sea wait are you saying that you and
[00:14:50] your brother lived in the
[00:14:51] water no people call the waters around
[00:14:54] Fontaine a sea it's actually just an
[00:14:56] inland Lake that's filled with fresh
[00:14:59] water know I can still see that Hill
[00:15:01] clearly imagine you see F just drowning
[00:15:04] with his [ __ ] helmet on
[00:15:05] complely he would Skip and jump tossing
[00:15:09] sand in the
[00:15:10] wind but now the water is gradually
[00:15:14] swallowing our
[00:15:16] memories it won't be long before it
[00:15:18] swallows
[00:15:20] us sorry is a professional diver yeah
[00:15:23] but doesn't really give okay but you've
[00:15:25] watched the trailer you know what I mean
[00:15:27] I don't believe of meeting are you
[00:15:30] lyette new friends Lenny and you are I
[00:15:35] am Lenny of the night looking after my
[00:15:37] sister she often comes here to reminisce
[00:15:40] about our childhood that's all there's
[00:15:42] no need for any
[00:15:43] concern allow me to introduce myself I'm
[00:15:47] Linny and this is my sister Lynette if I
[00:15:50] had to guess I'd say You must be
[00:15:53] travelers from abroad nice to meet you
[00:15:56] wait how do he know our name how does he
[00:15:58] know our name name is traveler this
[00:16:00] guy's good he's actually a magician this
[00:16:02] guy's good this guy
[00:16:03] [Music]
[00:16:04] Houdini even though we didn't really get
[00:16:07] what she was
[00:16:09] saying I see it's unusual for Lynette to
[00:16:12] be so willing to talk with anyone in
[00:16:15] fact she seldom speaks at all I'm
[00:16:18] usually the only one she ever talks to
[00:16:21] oh really then you to it's like a
[00:16:23] magician Duo where one never talks and
[00:16:24] the other one never stops
[00:16:27] talking
[00:16:29] pen and Teller of gin
[00:16:31] impact uh okay so that's how you think
[00:16:35] it is I also think my brother can be too
[00:16:38] talkative at
[00:16:41] times seems you were right Pimon we are
[00:16:44] quite similar can we have Len instead of
[00:16:47] Pon I'll trade you I'll trade you
[00:16:49] Lynette please take her pleas when she
[00:16:51] said that the water is engulfing your
[00:16:53] memories and that it won't be long
[00:16:55] before it engulfs you too okay y oh that
[00:17:01] it's from a prophecy that's been
[00:17:02] circulating in Fontaine for some time
[00:17:05] now well I suppose prophecy isn't
[00:17:08] exactly the right word because that
[00:17:10] implies a certain amount of uncertainty
[00:17:12] there's no doubt about what's happening
[00:17:14] in Fon now let me check something really
[00:17:23] fast uh okay

[00:25:52] her Spectators to be just being a little

[00:26:24] court all right now that that'll be
[00:26:28] worth
[00:26:29] seeing right this is Fontaine after all
[00:26:33] such a grand shut the [ __ ] upm much
[00:26:35] about the crowd's reactions seems you've
[00:26:37] spent a little theer she's literally a
[00:26:40] twitch streamer besides how exactly do
[00:26:42] you plan to have a du in court you mean
[00:26:45] you're going to put us on
[00:26:47] trial we haven't committed any
[00:26:50] crimes oh we have reason to put you on
[00:26:54] trial it's obvious isn't it obvious
[00:26:57] according to Fontaine law no one is
[00:27:00] permitted to release any flying objects
[00:27:03] within Fontaine City Limits during the
[00:27:05] first three days of each month what is
[00:27:08] it [ __ ] it's no September 4th oh well
[00:27:10] it's past midnight I don't know if that
[00:27:11] counts it's September 4th now was it not
[00:27:13] before oh so that's what they've done
[00:27:17] wrong that's our lady finina no one
[00:27:20] knows the laws of Fontaine like she
[00:27:23] does you call that obvious what kind of
[00:27:27] what is that wait flying
[00:27:31] object you mean
[00:27:33] Pon
[00:27:34] precisely now if you two have no
[00:27:37] objections then in the name of wait no
[00:27:40] way she arrested US for Pon dude that's
[00:27:41] kind of [ __ ] we didn't even know the
[00:27:43] laws we just got here my apologies lady
[00:27:45] finina I don't mean to spoil the fun but
[00:27:48] if you would allow me to interject I
[00:27:51] don't think that Pon here meets the
[00:27:53] definition of a flying object thanks
[00:27:55] Lenny you tell her Lenny finally that
[00:27:59] crazy how could anyone call P on a
[00:28:01] flying
[00:28:03] object
[00:28:05] great you must be Pro in these things my
[00:28:09] Loy I actually wrote an essay about how
[00:28:12] ignorance isn't a a legal defense but it
[00:28:14] should be because not okay not it should
[00:28:16] be but like example let's say they just
[00:28:18] pass a law like they pass a law in
[00:28:19] Montreal where like homeless people can
[00:28:21] sleep on benches so then the homeless
[00:28:23] people didn't know so then a bunch of
[00:28:23] homeless people just got arrested cuz
[00:28:25] they just passed the law and then they
[00:28:26] arrested a bunch of them so like I got
[00:28:27] an A+ in this cuz it's like why the [ __ ]
[00:28:29] would is that a thing if no one's going
[00:28:30] to warn what they they're [ __ ]
[00:28:31] homeless do they have a book telling
[00:28:33] them the laws no how would they know so
[00:28:34] it's [ __ ] up if you just pass a law
[00:28:36] and you're like [ __ ] you you should know
[00:28:37] this anyways so what she's doing is kind
[00:28:40] of weird cuz like we just got here how
[00:28:41] the [ __ ] would I know the but then also
[00:28:43] you could be like oh well I didn't know
[00:28:44] and then you Rob I get it but whatever
[00:28:46] doesn't
[00:28:47] matter as a magician who just rained on
[00:28:50] your parade I naturally should shoulder
[00:28:52] the responsibility of saving the show so
[00:28:56] with such an OD audience gathered here
[00:28:59] allow me to perform a trick for everyone
[00:29:01] oh a
[00:29:02] trick Yay good job
[00:29:07] Lenny we're pyro pyro traveler
[00:29:11] oh never
[00:29:13] [Music]
[00:29:15] mind
[00:29:18] T she has a
[00:29:20] leash hey
[00:29:25] what whoa whoa whoa whoo
[00:29:28] whoa whoa whoa what is
[00:29:36] this there as you can all clearly see
[00:29:40] Pon should be classified as well
[00:29:43] something like a balloon this rope has
[00:29:45] been in the Traveler's hand all along it
[00:29:48] was huh the [ __ ] you call that magic
[00:29:51] shut the [ __ ] up
[00:29:53] Reena I thought it was okay I like it 10
[00:29:55] again I thought I didn't like him I like
[00:29:56] it 10 again again huh I'm not sure what
[00:29:59] to
[00:30:02] think oh she's pissed she's pissed how
[00:30:05] dare you talk back to a god I am
[00:30:08] [Laughter]
[00:30:11] a amusing very amusing okay she enjoyed
[00:30:16] it never mind she enjoyed it the sort of
[00:30:17] unexpected twist that I enjoy with you
[00:30:21] here today's performance can finally be
[00:30:23] called complete dude she just likes
[00:30:25] content she just wants to be entertained
[00:30:27] I respect that all this as a performance
[00:30:29] in which case consider the matter of
[00:30:32] your trial I respect the God of Justice
[00:30:35] will not bring charges against an
[00:30:37] innocent person but when there are valid
[00:30:41] grounds I will not only judge travelers
[00:30:44] from
[00:30:45] abroad but even the gods of other
[00:30:50] lands
[00:30:52] what I look forward to seeing your
[00:30:55] upcoming performance at the Opera house
[00:30:57] Mr Linny and Miss Lynette that's enough
[00:31:00] for now too did you just taloo us I like
[00:31:05] her outfit it's pretty
[00:31:11] cute wait why does she think she's a
[00:31:13] Hydra archon though I thought that was
[00:31:14] kakomi I mean just look at kakomi it has
[00:31:16] to be
[00:31:20] her and just like that she's gone well
[00:31:25] that's the most unpredictable AR P's
[00:31:28] ever seen you never even had a chance to
[00:31:31] ask her anything but that's a problem
[00:31:33] for future Pon don't mention it happened
[00:31:37] to remember that there was such a law so
[00:31:39] I did a little preparation just in case
[00:31:43] I didn't think why don't we just bring
[00:31:44] [ __ ] uh why don't we bring Yen with
[00:31:46] us she could learn all the font laws you
[00:31:47] see what kind of God lady finina is she
[00:31:50] can be a bit confusing at times but she
[00:31:53] is still amable to
[00:31:55] reason amable like Amino oh no it's
[00:31:59] anemo I'm going to [ __ ] wrong one that
[00:32:02] was a spoiler you guys weren't supposed
[00:32:04] to hear I added the Toyota
[00:32:06] Cor you're not supposed to hear this gu
[00:32:09] added Toyota Cor while I was talking to
[00:32:13] Z doesn't matter anyway Pon had no idea
[00:32:16] you were a magician Lenny spoilers my
[00:32:18] bad sounded like you'll be performing at
[00:32:20] the opera house right I just know a few
[00:32:23] simple I use to make a living Lynette is
[00:32:26] my ass assist and
[00:32:28] lyette it will actually be my first time
[00:32:31] performing on the most prestigious stage
[00:32:33] in
[00:32:33] Fontaine opera house I just up what the
[00:32:38] f is happening
[00:32:40] here when there are no public trials
[00:32:43] being held the opera
[00:32:47] house to the people of Fontaine the line
[00:32:50] between a trial into performance can be
[00:32:53] a little blurred dude it's literally
[00:32:55] they're like streaming oh my God they
[00:32:57] stream content it's either drama where
[00:32:59] it's like a trial or they stream like
[00:33:01] performances dude finina is just a
[00:33:02] streamer I'm telling you I would watch I
[00:33:05] would watch I would be remissed to forgo
[00:33:07] this opportunity gifted by Fate my
[00:33:10] brother's always excited to make new
[00:33:13] friends oh sure wait her eyes kind of
[00:33:15] look like the abyss wait let me wait
[00:33:18] wait let me look at them again in that
[00:33:19] case why don't we go together I'll show
[00:33:21] you the way I just have something to
[00:33:24] take care of first you it literally
[00:33:26] looks like Spiral of this like not like
[00:33:28] the portal but like the like the all
[00:33:31] whatever perhaps you can help me
[00:33:32] distribute them to the people
[00:33:35] here uh this looks sus but okay what are
[00:33:40] they going to use it
[00:33:43] for about
[00:33:47] that you asked me before about the
[00:33:49] prophecy right let me start by telling
[00:33:52] he gives a bag to everyone everyone in
[00:33:54] font has a bag then AR Lino appears
[00:33:57] turns the bags into bigger bags kidnaps
[00:34:00] all of them steals all of Fontan true
[00:34:03] I'm not sure exactly when it began but a
[00:34:05] prophecy has been circulating around
[00:34:09] Fontaine it says that every person in
[00:34:11] Fontaine is why tear is not on his face
[00:34:14] no matter how the nation of Justice
[00:34:16] holds trial after trial this sin cannot
[00:34:19] be absolved until one day the water
[00:34:23] levels in Fontaine will rise and the
[00:34:25] sinful people will slowly be drowned
[00:34:28] okay in the end the people will all be
[00:34:30] dissolved into the waters and only the
[00:34:33] hydro archon will remain weeping on her
[00:34:37] throne only then will the sins of the
[00:34:40] people of Fontaine be washed away wait
[00:34:44] what that sounds pretty gloomy why are
[00:34:47] people in fontain born with sin what is
[00:34:50] that supposed to
[00:34:53] mean there are lots of guesses some say
[00:34:57] that the ancestors of Fontaine stole the
[00:34:59] power finina is like sad and depressed
[00:35:01] but she she covers it up by being funny
[00:35:04] and goofy never heeded the first Hydro
[00:35:06] archon's warnings and offended Celestia
[00:35:09] I understand you Fontaine
[00:35:12] evidence there hasn't been concrete
[00:35:14] evidence for any of these claims so they
[00:35:17] can only be regarded as conjecture if
[00:35:20] even the people in don't know what sin
[00:35:23] they committed wouldn't it be better
[00:35:26] just to ignore the prophecy completely
[00:35:29] that's exactly what the people did at
[00:35:31] first but in the last few years the
[00:35:35] water just freeze it hire [ __ ] Ka get
[00:35:37] a cryo dude yo bring some cryo people
[00:35:40] over yo Chong Yun what's up
[00:35:44] man many places have already been
[00:35:46] completely submerged and now lie Beneath
[00:35:49] the Sea many people carry on with their
[00:35:52] lives as before and shrug it off as a
[00:35:54] natural phenomenon but my family and I
[00:35:57] think that wait so is f just fighting
[00:35:59] global warming possibility which would
[00:36:01] end up sentencing them to death they
[00:36:04] hope that at least the people who reside
[00:36:05] near

[00:42:23] watching oh he's right
[00:42:26] sh your voice down we need to think of a
[00:42:29] way to catch her but it seems she's very
[00:42:32] al Five gifted betting that we're going
[00:42:34] to catch her and then she's going to
[00:42:35] have a sad backstory I'm sorry my child
[00:42:38] is he needs bread to eat watch watch and
[00:42:41] then we're going to feel bad for watch
[00:42:43] run watch all right
[00:42:50] let dude if you have a family to feed
[00:42:52] just steal from a [ __ ] store don't
[00:42:54] steal from a person true okay I'm not ad
[00:42:57] in game I'm not advocating for theft I'm
[00:42:58] just saying I'm just saying should I
[00:43:01] just TV I feel like it's
[00:43:04] up no but don't steal from a random
[00:43:07] civilian that's different like
[00:43:10] anyways this is the spot where Lenny
[00:43:13] wanted us to
[00:43:15] wait future lawyer okay listen I could
[00:43:19] probably make a defense your honor my
[00:43:21] client was starving he needed food
[00:43:24] versus uh your honor my client
[00:43:26] like stole from an innocent in game
[00:43:28] don't do that just I'm just
[00:43:30] saying also if you can't afford bread
[00:43:33] you're not going to hire a lawyer I mean
[00:43:35] I guess you'd have an attorney like
[00:43:36] given to you but then those people it is
[00:43:38] what it is get ready to stop
[00:43:41] her oh no did she notice that she start
[00:43:45] of running the other
[00:43:49] direction what should we do should we
[00:43:51] chase
[00:43:54] her our job is to block this path you're
[00:43:57] right she might also be trying to lure
[00:43:59] us
[00:44:01] away you wait but there's no sign of the
[00:44:04] thief nothing's happened for a while now
[00:44:07] I'm wonders if Lenny caught the thief
[00:44:10] let's go find Lenny wait where the Lenny
[00:44:13] are you slacking the [ __ ] is Linny doing
[00:44:15] do I have to go back down let's go back
[00:44:17] down uh let's go this
[00:44:21] way wait what L's up here
[00:44:28] dude how was I supp to L was back
[00:44:33] there uh can I go through here yeah I
[00:44:35] can
[00:44:40] cool you should check to make sure
[00:44:42] you're not missing anything why made off
[00:44:43] it we lost the bet basically tldr we
[00:44:45] lost the
[00:44:51] bet okay Auto no that was all oh I can't
[00:44:57] thank you enough anyway I should be
[00:45:00] going
[00:45:02] now oh were you returning with the thief
[00:45:05] had
[00:45:06] stolen that's right pity I wasn't able
[00:45:09] to catch her she distracted me by
[00:45:12] dropping the thing she stole On The
[00:45:13] Ground by the time I looked back she was
[00:45:16] already gone I saw the general direction
[00:45:19] she went but Lenny twisted his ankle and
[00:45:22] I needed to make sure he was okay what
[00:45:24] just check on him after
[00:45:26] did you get hurt
[00:45:29] Lenny I'll be all right it's what a
[00:45:31] shitty story I don't know why you would
[00:45:33] lie about something like that so maybe
[00:45:34] he telling the truth but that's a sus
[00:45:36] story if you want to play it being oh
[00:45:38] yeah Lenny twisted his ankle and then I
[00:45:39] had to stop and see if his ankle was if
[00:45:42] you managed to derail our performance as
[00:45:44] a result
[00:45:45] sus you're right you're right sorry
[00:45:49] Lynette I have to admit that the thief
[00:45:52] was even more skilled than I had
[00:45:53] anticipated but at least we were able
[00:45:55] ble to get the stolen items back so it
[00:45:58] wasn't a complete failure what a
[00:46:00] slippery little thief it's been an hour
[00:46:02] and he's 10 minutes in okay shut the
[00:46:04] [ __ ] up surely we're like halfway done
[00:46:06] the First Act surely we're like halfway
[00:46:08] done the First Act no no no no no no
[00:46:10] dude D I'm not interrupting dialogue I
[00:46:12] want to hear what they have to say don't
[00:46:14] say we're 10 minutes in also we started
[00:46:16] the Arkham Quest around 30 to 40 minutes
[00:46:19] into the stream let's let's say 30 okay
[00:46:21] so there is a little bit of time for
[00:46:24] leeway
[00:46:26] okay what's happening
[00:46:33] here so we ride this thing to go into
[00:46:36] the city what an ingenious way to get
[00:46:39] around this is an aqua bus it allows
[00:46:42] people to travel between several key
[00:46:44] locations around Fontaine it's pretty
[00:46:46] convenient but the ride can become a
[00:46:49] little dull after a while the scenery is
[00:46:51] always the same that's why it's better
[00:46:53] to travel with friends I mean it's a bus
[00:46:56] that's what you expect even when I'm
[00:46:58] riding with
[00:47:00] you D no that's not what I meant it's
[00:47:04] just that uh well you don't really talk
[00:47:07] that
[00:47:08] much that boring it doesn't really feel
[00:47:10] like a real trip when it's just the two
[00:47:11] of us it's the same as being at
[00:47:16] home L brother
[00:47:21] whatever guess that's what it's like to
[00:47:23] be an older
[00:47:24] brother it's about time for us to leave
[00:47:27] let's get on
[00:47:33] board okay
[00:47:36] oh that looks like Yen oh it's yeah
[00:47:39] Charlotte like Yen
[00:47:41] okay what's up Charlotte is she on the
[00:47:44] [ __ ] bus with us oh she is she on the
[00:47:47] fortnite battle
[00:47:50] bus
[00:47:52] what traveler pon
[00:47:56] sh
[00:47:59] it I like the bird on her thing wait I
[00:48:02] never guessed I'd bump into you all
[00:48:03] riding the aquaus in the story of my
[00:48:06] life this is big news wait the
[00:48:07] background is moving as we're swimming
[00:48:09] what if I never go past the dialogue
[00:48:10] will we get to the next location or is
[00:48:11] it just going to keep looping like cuz
[00:48:13] okay we just passed the pillar what's
[00:48:14] going to what's going to pass next what
[00:48:15] are you doing wait I'm not I don't have
[00:48:17] Auto hear anything about you paying us a
[00:48:19] visit it just Auto it's quite the
[00:48:22] coincidence but as Travelers we're
[00:48:24] always on the move it's not surprising
[00:48:26] that nobody knew we were coming okay uh
[00:48:30] though we still have no idea no need for
[00:48:33] inter when did we okay I know we met
[00:48:35] Charlotte in like an event but wasn't
[00:48:36] that time gated if you didn't do the
[00:48:38] event when was the last time we met
[00:48:39] Charlotte cuz in the dialogue she was
[00:48:41] like oh nice to see you
[00:48:44] again oh dialog changes if you didn't do
[00:48:46] it oh okay okay okay I wouldn't be much
[00:48:48] of a reporter if I didn't know who they
[00:48:50] were it's a pleasure to meet you I'm
[00:48:52] Charlotte a reporter for the steam bird
[00:48:54] hello Charlotte
[00:48:57] nice to meet you from the steam bird huh
[00:49:00] we've often relied on your paper to
[00:49:02] promote our
[00:49:04] performances it's an honor to meet
[00:49:07] you now that everyone knows each other
[00:49:09] Fontaine suddenly doesn't feel like such
[00:49:12] an unfamiliar place so what have you
[00:49:15] been up to lately sh not too much when
[00:49:17] there isn't any breaking news I mainly
[00:49:18] cover the trials at the opera house okay
[00:49:20] you can still manage to keep readers
[00:49:22] attention as long as you tell things
[00:49:24] from a clever enough angle even if it's
[00:49:26] the same old topic dumb they're just
[00:49:28] recycling contents reporting on how a
[00:49:29] scammer once deceived vulnerable girls
[00:49:31] into relationships or how a financial
[00:49:34] criminal was once so poor that they ate
[00:49:36] a single piece of bread for 5 days Dam
[00:49:40] but that's not really the kind of news
[00:49:41] you're after you're right seems you know
[00:49:44] me pretty well what I'm really after is
[00:49:47] exclusive Sensational news pieces that
[00:49:49] could shake the country these smaller
[00:49:52] stories are a waste of my talents I just
[00:49:55] remember remember I've been following a
[00:49:57] case lately well a series of cases
[00:50:00] actually you mean the serial
[00:50:02] disappearances of young women okay okay
[00:50:04] okay okay no spoilers in chat or you
[00:50:06] will be banned no fake spoilers either
[00:50:08] for this whole thing but I feel like
[00:50:11] whenever it's like two people and like a
[00:50:13] detective and we're like talking I feel
[00:50:15] like the case she's on is about them
[00:50:17] again no spoilers I don't want to know
[00:50:19] if I'm right or wrong but I feel like
[00:50:21] Charlotte's probably like looking for
[00:50:22] them or some [ __ ] probably or like arino
[00:50:25] who the story in the steam cuz
[00:50:28] mysterious disappearances of people I
[00:50:30] don't know if she said I don't know what
[00:50:31] she said but disappearances all I'm
[00:50:34] saying when that happens I bet all the
[00:50:37] other reporters will shed tears of Envy
[00:50:40] I've already gathered all kinds of
[00:50:41] materials I just can't wait for the
[00:50:43] truth to be revealed so what is the
[00:50:47] serial of young women case you mean the
[00:50:50] culprit hasn't been
[00:50:53] found okay serial disapp appearances
[00:50:56] that is a Mona The First missing girl
[00:50:58] case happened almost 20 years ago what
[00:51:00] the [ __ ] and ever since after a period
[00:51:03] of time this been happening for 20 years
[00:51:05] and you didn't catch how bad of a
[00:51:07] detective is this nation you have the
[00:51:08] [ __ ] God of Justice D bro 20
[00:51:13] years but the scariest part is that to
[00:51:16] this day bro we caught the Tor in like a
[00:51:18] week well we didn't catch him
[00:51:21] but we we beat Scar's [ __ ] Mech in
[00:51:24] like two days have been arrested over
[00:51:26] the years in connection with this case
[00:51:27] but shortly after each arrest another
[00:51:29] dis they don't have hozo
[00:51:33] true uh must be more than one criminal
[00:51:36] yes it's possible but either way I
[00:51:39] believe that every case has some precise
[00:51:41] truth behind it waiting to be exposed
[00:51:44] yes I agree and at the very least the
[00:51:47] family of those missing girls deserves
[00:51:49] some sort of
[00:51:50] explanation that is a weird response to
[00:51:52] that Lenny I just imagined for a second
[00:51:54] what I would do I would be more
[00:51:55] concerned about the missing girls but
[00:51:57] you know families are cool too I guess
[00:51:59] back and then find a way to track down
[00:52:01] the
[00:52:03] culprit please don't imagine that
[00:52:05] imagine going up to someone be like yo
[00:52:07] did you hear this person's missing
[00:52:08] you're like yeah we should talk to we
[00:52:09] should their family deserves an
[00:52:10] explanation it's like I mean yeah but
[00:52:14] you know it's been 20 years yeah I mean
[00:52:16] that's fair I guess it has been a long
[00:52:18] time but I'm just saying that is a weird
[00:52:22] response hey we're almost there look
[00:52:33] has been 20
[00:52:39] years yeah Lenny also looks like 10 so
[00:52:41] there's no way he he committed a crime
[00:52:43] 20 years
[00:52:45] ago Dude the trailer showing arlino
[00:52:48] pushing them [ __ ] with me now I'm
[00:52:49] thinking it's all them or are likein
[00:52:50] know this whole story Quest is [ __ ] by
[00:52:52] the trailer this is why I hate trailers
[00:52:54] I watched like a like like [ __ ] 10
[00:52:56] years ago I watched a fast and furious
[00:52:57] movie where there was a trailer and in
[00:52:58] the trailer they showed like a plane and
[00:53:00] then the movie looked like it was going
[00:53:01] to end but I hadn't seen the plane yet
[00:53:02] so like okay there's no way it's ending
[00:53:04] and then surely enough it was a fake
[00:53:05] ending and then a [ __ ] plane came and
[00:53:07] then the whole thing was spoiled from a
[00:53:08] trailer okay I'll shut
[00:53:10] [Music]
[00:53:21] up well I really enjoyed chatting with
[00:53:24] you life should be full of pleasant I
[00:53:26] like I like how do I even say her name I
[00:53:28] mean in French it's Charlotte but I
[00:53:29] don't think that's how you I like her
[00:53:31] she's talkative she's cool yeah us as
[00:53:33] well the r she she you know she kind of

[00:58:23] is here it often rains on days where
[00:58:25] there are trials it's in the opera house
[00:58:28] but don't worry it'll clear up soon
[00:58:33] enough still not going to find it
[00:58:36] there's a legend about the rain that I
[00:58:37] tend to believe it said that a dragon of
[00:58:41] water once resided in Fon okay okay okay
[00:58:43] okay no spoilers Dragon went but I know
[00:58:46] who the dragon of water is cuz I've seen

[00:58:52] looked at anything it's nothing sus I've
[00:58:54] just seen fan art that is it I don't
[00:58:56] know if it's true if it's Canon if it's
[00:58:58] sus if it's if it's I just I've seen fan
[00:59:01] art of a dragon of water that's all I'm
[00:59:02] saying that's all I'm saying that's all

[00:59:13] Art it is what it is I'm not going to
[00:59:16] lie about what I've seen I'm not going
[00:59:17] to pretend I should yell toward the sky
[00:59:20] at the top of my lungs Hydro Dragon
[00:59:23] Hydro Dragon
[00:59:25] don't

[00:59:52] it's raining outside when you're looking
[00:59:53] through like a a a glass like a window
[00:59:56] and then so you look at like the puddles
[00:59:57] of water to see if there's like drops
[00:59:59] that was me right now that was
[01:00:02] me sorry it might be because we've never

[01:01:09] inconvenience okay quite useless when it
[01:01:12] comes to such
[01:01:13] tasks I'll think of a way to make it up
[01:01:15] to you oh he seems wholesome this will
[01:01:19] be a walk in the park for
[01:01:23] us
[01:01:25] thanks again you
[01:01:27] two okay well where is bomo Workshop so
[01:01:31] over
[01:01:32] there um po right
[01:01:40] here am I the only one who doesn't like
[01:01:42] f and a yes and you should be
[01:01:53] shamed
[01:01:55] okay we've already met her blacksmith oh
[01:01:58] hello there new customers looking to buy
[01:02:01] or do you need something made oh no
[01:02:04] we're just here to ah these must be for
[01:02:05] magic Pockets no no need they've already
[01:02:08] prepaid several batches work but they
[01:02:10] insisted on paying the full
[01:02:12] amount so yeah lenn's [ __ ] Rich
[01:02:15] actually loaded I can't say for sure but
[01:02:19] who knows maybe there's he's being a
[01:02:21] magician to money launder from his crime
[01:02:24] money what you used to make why use your
[01:02:26] hands when a machine can do the work it
[01:02:28] would be a waste not to use but where
[01:02:31] does a big machine like that get it
[01:02:33] power D I never thought I'd see Jung
[01:02:35] cook made so little complicated I'm not
[01:02:38] sure I can but basically everything we
[01:02:41] usually use here in
[01:02:43] indium it's a type of energy that's
[01:02:45] produced from trials okay I can't how
[01:02:50] everyone does the trials they do it on
[01:02:52] solar powered treadmills and it makes
[01:02:54] not s power but like the energy like
[01:02:56] completely sure of all the details
[01:02:58] myself but basically when a trial is in
[01:03:01] session the or
[01:03:03] meard harvests people's belief in
[01:03:05] Justice and converts it into energy to
[01:03:08] be used all around Fontaine so that's
[01:03:11] what its other function
[01:03:13] is pman heard that the orrice was
[01:03:15] created by but pman still doesn't get it
[01:03:19] how could something unreliable like
[01:03:21] people's beliefs be turned into a stable
[01:03:23] power source for these the gods rely on
[01:03:27] belief to obtain
[01:03:29] power it's like Robin Hood no what is
[01:03:33] that the [ __ ] the fairy tooth fairy
[01:03:35] what's What's that show Tinker Bell what
[01:03:38] is that show called I don't movie I
[01:03:40] don't no not Robin Hood [ __ ] uh ter
[01:03:44] Bell what does terker Bell from Peter
[01:03:45] Pan true it's like Peter Pan I didn't
[01:03:49] mean to say Robin Hood he's he steals
[01:03:50] from Rich for the poor it isn't produced
[01:03:53] by the power of the archon
[01:03:54] but it is unable speaking of Robin Hood
[01:03:56] do you know what else is taking from
[01:03:57] Rich and giving to the the less
[01:04:00] Rich Prime subscriptions you're taking
[01:04:03] money from Prime Jeff Bezos and giving
[01:04:05] it to streamers of your choice I'm not
[01:04:07] saying you have to give it to me don't
[01:04:08] worry but I'm just saying it's a free
[01:04:10] subscription that's all I'm saying if
[01:04:11] you don't spend it the money is going to
[01:04:13] Amazon I'm just saying I thought I'd
[01:04:16] find you hard at work but here you who
[01:04:18] the [ __ ] is true and since you're
[01:04:21] already talking l w true few words with
[01:04:25] me you you again didn't I already
[01:04:28] promise you that I'd have the mor iio to
[01:04:30] confer of cabriere by next I thought I
[01:04:32] said Carrie bear why are you hounding me

[01:05:49] boring but that fate brought our P
[01:05:53] together today all right not only will I

[01:06:36] me boy if you want that was aggressive
[01:06:40] Boy [ __ ] sounded like a yo that was hey
[01:06:43] I just said like a slur why do you say
[01:06:45] like that oh by the way traveler the
[01:06:47] last time I took Tonia and tuer ice
[01:06:49] fishing what the T
[01:06:51] sayy don't d t
[01:06:54] all right boys let's they're dead well
[01:06:56] at least I called that they were going
[01:06:57] to die what did T say at least let me
[01:07:00] finish one sentence fine though the bank
[01:07:03] told me not to get rough with our
[01:07:05] clients you're the ones who started it
[01:07:08] this is an act of
[01:07:10] self-defense you two will have to be my
[01:07:12] Witnesses
[01:07:14] okay okay I'm unsure this won't take
[01:07:18] long Rip
[01:07:22] Tide Rip Tide you can run
[01:07:28] but right let's see what this child
[01:07:30] looks like C3 okay uh 918 uh talents
[01:07:35] okay uh well nine is it's plus one so
[01:07:37] it's kind of 888 but you know what I
[01:07:39] mean okay for a blast on child
[01:07:40] interesting let's look at the ratio n oh
[01:07:43] a one to one ratio that is pretty good
[01:07:45] we have 2500 attack here uh 135 energy
[01:07:49] recharge
[01:07:51] um 28% Hydro Dam damage bonus which is a
[01:07:54] weird
[01:07:57] number 27,000
[01:08:00] HP
[01:08:01] interesting there is no Hydro damage
[01:08:04] bonus uh on the
[01:08:17] Goblet even Ho's child can't PR K wait
[01:08:21] What's your deal Brad how are you so
[01:08:24] strong if you just stab 0 CR Northland
[01:08:27] Bank wait don't tell me
[01:08:31] you're now you notice it's a little late
[01:08:34] don't you think just make sure you
[01:08:37] understand that you don't mess with
[01:08:38] Northland bank got
[01:08:41] it D
[01:08:45] whoa huh
[01:08:48] uhoh uh-oh now's my chance
[01:08:52] uh-oh hey Mr socks bro physical child
[01:08:56] can still beat you yeah that's what I
[01:08:57] was going to say [ __ ] slapped him huh
[01:09:01] that was weird what is Vision stop
[01:09:04] working so he's going to use his
[01:09:06] delusion we get Electro child we're
[01:09:08] going to get playable El child too true
[01:09:12] I'm not sure it's as if I lost control
[01:09:16] of my hydro Powers when I needed them
[01:09:18] and then he's going to be why is why are
[01:09:19] the people running like
[01:09:21] this strange he's going to we're going
[01:09:23] to child and then he's going to be the
[01:09:25] best for as a driver for an overload
[01:09:27] shling team it's going to be called
[01:09:29] inter what's okay wait it has to be a
[01:09:31] variation of international inter it
[01:09:33] doesn't matter if I want to stay
[01:09:36] overal on my vision anyway besides I
[01:09:40] always have my delusion in case I need
[01:09:42] it so what are you doing in Fontaine
[01:09:45] child I don't see its work for Northland
[01:09:47] Bank well I guess it's because I've been
[01:09:50] in a bad mood lately huh what kind of
[01:09:53] the reason is
[01:09:55] that I don't know but recently there
[01:09:58] seems to be some sort of restless power
[01:10:01] stirring inside of me delusional okay
[01:10:03] yeah that's actually the team name but
[01:10:04] every now and then I feel like I'm in a
[01:10:06] terrible
[01:10:08] mood maybe you losing control of your
[01:10:11] vision just now is connected with that
[01:10:13] power you're feeling
[01:10:14] inside H that is a possibility so about
[01:10:18] this power I can't remember if I ever
[01:10:20] mentioned it before but when I was 14
[01:10:22] Bro you've I I have heard this story
[01:10:24] aund times I went to the abyss as a
[01:10:27] child I had to fight sorry it was during
[01:10:30] that time I learned nearly all of my
[01:10:32] abilities the one who took me under her
[01:10:34] wing and taught me was named skirk dude
[01:10:37] I literally asked the Jeff like a few
[01:10:38] days ago who skirk was cuz we were
[01:10:41] playing scribble we were playing
[01:10:42] scribble genin character Edition and he
[01:10:44] was like oh do you not read the lore and
[01:10:46] then he told me so I was like okay she
[01:10:48] was always quiet and very mysterious
[01:10:51] nobody knew where she came from or what
[01:10:53] she had been
[01:10:54] and she was always very strict when
[01:10:56] teaching me combat techniques one time I
[01:10:59] asked her why she was willing to take me
[01:11:01] on as an apprentice from what I could
[01:11:03] make of her answer it was because I had
[01:11:07] awakened it and traces of it remained on
[01:11:11] me she said all my combat training be
[01:11:14] useful in the future but what is it what
[01:11:19] did she never explained that but my
[01:11:22] guess is that a dream a dream I saw when
[01:11:24] I had just found that suspicious in my
[01:11:27] dream I was in the deepest depths of the
[01:11:29] Sea and the boundless seab bed was all
[01:11:32] around me but in front of me appeared a
[01:11:34] whale that was so massive I felt like I
[01:11:37] couldn't breathe oh a big whale oh that
[01:11:41] sounds familiar when we fought against
[01:11:43] you before you summoned a huge whale
[01:11:47] that's that's just an abstract form of a
[01:11:49] whale that I create using my elemental
[01:11:51] powers it takes that shap because
[01:11:53] because the scene I dreamt of the whale
[01:11:55] has always been stuck in my mind that's
[01:11:57] you I'm not a whale if anything I'm like
[01:11:59] a cute little seal or a dolphin
[01:12:02] true it's very possible that the power
[01:12:04] inside is connected to your power
[01:12:06] incident to your incident in the abyss
[01:12:07] so why don't you just go ask your master
[01:12:09] you make it sound so easy ever since the
[01:12:12] incident I experienced there I've never
[01:12:15] stopped searching for master skirk and
[01:12:17] that unknown Abyss but it's been years
[01:12:19] now and I've still found nothing skk
[01:12:21] will come out and we'll get more AB
[01:12:23] should be the last boss in the abyss
[01:12:25] when we get floor 15 true we'll get
[01:12:27] floor 20 actually a new Abyss wave in
[01:12:31] patch
[01:12:32] 7.0 yeah I'm out of leads at this point
[01:12:35] but there's nothing more I can do it
[01:12:37] seems that strange Encounters in this
[01:12:39] world tend to be elusive like that oh
[01:12:42] seems the time really flies when I'm
[01:12:44] talking with you I just remembered I
[01:12:46] have somewhere else I need to be what
[01:12:49] more work for the Northland Bay no old
[01:12:51] friends to catch up on it's it's more
[01:12:54] true I called it lately I've been
[01:12:56] sparring with some of fontaine's
[01:12:57] official Champion Duelists whenever I'm
[01:12:59] feeling bored official Champion duel you
[01:13:04] mean it's their job yep in Fontaine
[01:13:06] before a criminal goes to court they're
[01:13:08] given One Chance by requesting a du you
[01:13:12] can [ __ ] request trial by
[01:13:13] combat the champion Duelists are all
[01:13:16] powerful Fighters selected from among
[01:13:18] the
[01:13:19] nation The Duel itself a No Holds Barred
[01:13:22] fight with no specif stopping point so
[01:13:25] engaging in such a duel is regarded as a
[01:13:27] symbol of Defending Your honor if a
[01:13:29] criminal manages to win the duel they'll
[01:13:32] be acquitted but if they lose they'll
[01:13:34] have no choice but to stand trial and
[01:13:37] the worst case scenario is that you're
[01:13:39] simply killed in the duel though it's
[01:13:42] rumored that Fontaine has a death
[01:13:43] penalty so really I didn't mean to that
[01:13:47] to duel are those who have suffered a
[01:13:48] grave Injustice in being accused or
[01:13:51] those who greatly value their honor
[01:13:53] otherwise why gamble with your life wait
[01:13:56] if font if you can just wait if you can
[01:13:58] just duel your way if you can just okay
[01:14:00] okay first of all this proves that
[01:14:02] finina just cares about content second
[01:14:03] of all if you can do r at anything why
[01:14:05] don't you just [ __ ] dude just become
[01:14:06] buff just like and then commit crime and
[01:14:10] then you just can fight your way out of
[01:14:13] it apparently it's exceedingly rare for
[01:14:16] anyone to actually wi never mind
[01:14:18] Fontaine probably enacted you going to
[01:14:20] win that the nation respect the honor of
[01:14:23] it
[01:14:23] citizens besides none of the champion
[01:14:26] Duelists are to be trifled with which is
[01:14:29] exactly why I was itching to face them
[01:14:31] as soon as I got to
[01:14:33] Fontaine apparently the one I'm meeting
[01:14:35] today Claren is the strongest of the
[01:14:38] champion Duelists how does child no
[01:14:40] asking her for some time before she face
[01:14:43] me today well that's child for
[01:14:47] you Pon feels like we heard that name
[01:14:49] somewhere before
[01:14:52] cland Oh before I forget I want you to
[01:14:56] have this
[01:14:58] oh what the huh your vision you're
[01:15:04] seriously just giving it away I'm just
[01:15:06] worried that it could become
[01:15:07] uncontrollable again I'd be pretty upset
[01:15:10] if it got in the way of my duel so I
[01:15:12] think I'll be better off without dude
[01:15:14] let us pull for Electro child I just
[01:15:16] need you to hold on to it for a short
[01:15:18] while I'll come retrieve it when I have
[01:15:20] some time later himon knows what you're
[01:15:22] up to
[01:15:23] you just want an excuse to come talk to
[01:15:26] us again don't
[01:15:28] you whatever gave you that idea I'll be
[01:15:31] in touch

[01:15:39] guy well seem we don't

[01:15:59] child now after doing this Quest and you
[01:16:01] just can't use abilities you just can't

[01:16:05] coming the murder mystery novels here
[01:16:08] are amazing the henet here in Fontaine
[01:16:11] are a lot different than the light
[01:16:12] novels you see from Yi Publishing House
[01:16:15] both have their merits but my mind
[01:16:17] thinks this style of novels are more
[01:16:20] well novel wow thanks pon to reach the
[01:16:23] moment when the mystery is uncovered
[01:16:25] especially in the one p was just reading
[01:16:28] you should buy a copy and read it
[01:16:30] too you know what maybe I will Pon I'm
[01:16:33] good sorry about that uh hey yeah let's
[01:16:37] go let me Thea on let's go

[01:16:45] and you don't have this place do you
[01:16:46] have to [ __ ] aquaus all the way there
[01:16:51] um no wonder it took people 10 years
[01:16:54] I'm already
[01:17:02] here now this is fancy that's pretty
[01:17:05] cool I I will admit I will admit I will
[01:17:08] admit I will admit the performance no
[01:17:10] wonder Linny and Lynette were looking
[01:17:12] forward to you can swim there dude stop
[01:17:13] swimming everywhere looks like there's a
[01:17:15] lot of people standing the same people
[01:17:17] that swam to inauma stop it Aron please
[01:17:21] bless us and healthy child we
[01:17:25] pray I don't know why you always feel
[01:17:27] the need to ask so much I'll be happy as
[01:17:30] long as our child is healthy and lives a
[01:17:32] peaceful
[01:17:33] life I guess in font makes sense gu if
[01:17:36] there are kid then there's no doubt
[01:17:37] they'll turn out smart shut the [ __ ] up
[01:17:39] show
[01:17:41] you maybe this is one of the customs in
[01:17:44] Fon
[01:17:46] v
[01:17:48] vashi wait whoa
[01:17:51] who wrong
[01:17:56] [Music]
[01:18:01] no CL didn't say anything are you
[01:18:04] hearing welcome to the Fountain of
[01:18:05] Lucine the [ __ ] is V Fontaine converges
[01:18:10] here it's customary for newly WS to come
[01:18:14] here you scared p m lny asked me to wait
[01:18:19] here for you
[01:18:21] remember right by the way Lynette I hear
[01:18:25] I seem to hear a faint voice what do you
[01:18:27] mean there are a lot of people here
[01:18:29] right now no no it was coming from it
[01:18:30] was coming from the fountain hey not
[01:18:33] trying to no no it was it was a voice
[01:18:34] coming from the
[01:18:36] see I might be able to tell you
[01:18:38] something that could help explain the
[01:18:39] voice you heard okay please help me in
[01:18:41] fact you might not be imagining things
[01:18:44] at all I suspect that what you heard is
[01:18:46] a result of your hyp sensitivity to the
[01:18:48] hydro element others in my family have
[01:18:51] had similar experiences
[01:18:53] it's because of her sensitivity to the
[01:18:55] hydro element but what would hearing a
[01:18:57] voice have to do with elemental pth when
[01:18:59] do you cry
[01:19:01] Pimon what what does that have to do
[01:19:04] with the
[01:19:06] [ __ ] just answer me when do you
[01:19:13] cry all the time when P's really sad oh
[01:19:17] and Pon supery yeah all the time then
[01:19:20] you should understand that tears can
[01:19:22] change your most intense
[01:19:24] emotions like I just mentioned the
[01:19:27] Fountain of Lucine is where all the
[01:19:29] flowing water in Fontaine
[01:19:31] converges even the tears that fall to
[01:19:33] the ground will eventually gather here
[01:19:36] so maybe what you heard was the intense
[01:19:38] emotion coming someone's
[01:19:41] tears so what did the voice say it says
[01:19:45] vashi H Vash you're hearing their
[01:19:49] emotions the P wonders what happened to
[01:19:52] them rather than worrying about them we
[01:19:54] should worry about my brother first
[01:19:56] don't let that calm look of his fool you
[01:19:58] he tends to get pretty nervous just
[01:20:00] before performance so chatting with
[01:20:02] Lenny might help him relax a little

[01:28:37] a sign that she's nervous
[01:28:41] whatever now some of you may be thinking
[01:28:44] two Vision holders who can freely
[01:28:46] manipulate elemental powers performing
[01:28:48] magic is not true magic at all so we
[01:28:51] will let go of our vision
[01:28:52] I would like to take a moment to assure
[01:28:54] you that elemental powers will have
[01:28:56] nothing to do with what you will wi five
[01:28:58] out of 10 start so far you could have
[01:28:59] put your Visions in like a bag or
[01:29:01] something to make it seem more
[01:29:02] believable more like performative all
[01:29:04] good oh never mind never 10 out of 10 10

[01:29:22] stage to make some
[01:29:23] preparations I know you might miss her
[01:29:26] but don't worry she'll be coming right
[01:29:28] back on stage momentarily perhaps in an
[01:29:31] unexpected way I'm sure she'll be soon
[01:29:36] enough and before I forget there's one
[01:29:39] more thing I should say we have a
[01:29:41] special guest know what can happen in
[01:29:43] the blink of an eye that sounds like
[01:29:45] spoilers like like like that sounds like
[01:29:47] we're going to hear that at the end of
[01:29:48] the quest a magician's greatest skill is
[01:29:51] making things dis disappear or appear
[01:29:54] the possibilities are
[01:30:01] [Music]
[01:30:03] endless boom

[01:31:30] dting us he's deating us this plan even
[01:31:34] air can't escape an amateur magician

[01:32:45] do anything wasn't lyette inside the
[01:32:47] water tank how did she disappear and
[01:32:49] what a show you could see easily through
[01:32:51] his tricks then that would mean that his
[01:32:53] skills are still lacking so true n yet
[01:32:55] actually I can't see through your
[01:32:57] clothing happening on stage rather than
[01:33:00] getting caught up and trying to see that
[01:33:02] which has been intentionally true [ __ ]
[01:33:04] the people that are like I know how you
[01:33:06] did your magic trick [ __ ] those people
[01:33:08] true net well said guess you're right

[01:33:19] but our magical jour Journey has only
[01:33:22] just begun I've prepared even more
[01:33:25] astonishing surprises for everyone here
[01:33:28] okay the magic of transformation and
[01:33:30] disappearance can go far beyond what
[01:33:32] you've just
[01:33:36] seen I'm sure many of you are thinking
[01:33:38] that escaping the water tank was
[01:33:40] impressive I'm focusing but Lynette is
[01:33:43] still my assistant after all in which
[01:33:46] case I have ample time to make all
[01:33:49] necessary preparations what if L just
[01:33:51] shoots someone and then we think it's
[01:33:52] magic so he gets away with it I will
[01:33:54] require the participation of one lucky
[01:33:57] audience member please if my assistants
[01:34:00] could bring out the magical boxes now
[01:34:03] there are two boxes and only two boxes
[01:34:07] one is here and one is there in the
[01:34:09] aisle among the AI among
[01:34:11] the I guess it wasn't Among Us okay sure

[01:35:17] will take you beside the magic
[01:35:20] box

[01:35:28] be as comfortable as possible you don't

[01:36:45] going
[01:36:48] 57 55 54 53 52 51 you

[01:37:01] consequence of my all right I'll them
[01:37:03] okay sure dude do not worry about me
[01:37:06] just enjoy the show all right okay all
[01:37:10] right you look so serious that Pon
[01:37:12] thought you might be feeling
[01:37:13] uncomfortable or something 40 39 38 Mr
[01:37:18] Linny are you all right in there is
[01:37:20] everything right ready who the [ __ ] is
[01:37:22] Garrick I'm fine I'm fine I'm just
[01:37:24] double cheing the direction of the magic
[01:37:26] oh no something went wrong watch faster
[01:37:29] if we get sent to the wrong places for
[01:37:32] example midair right above Len would
[01:37:35] never [ __ ] up even though he's saying
[01:37:37] that Lenny doesn't seem nervous it's a
[01:37:38] part of the
[01:37:39] show
[01:37:41] bang what was that noise did you hear it
[01:37:44] too not sure anyway it
[01:37:49] doesn't oh [ __ ] why do we hear strong Mr
[01:37:52] Lenny I can still hear you moving in
[01:37:54] there I seem to have accidentally
[01:37:56] knocked over a decoration I'm trying to
[01:37:59] fix it but it's Pitch Black in here I
[01:38:01] can't tell left from right never mind
[01:38:04] the decorations there's no time for that
[01:38:06] the show is what's important no that's
[01:38:09] unacceptable I want my show to be
[01:38:11] perfect don't worry we still have 20
[01:38:14] seconds hear them counting 19
[01:38:19] 18 it seems things aren't quite going as
[01:38:21] planned I apologize every is either
[01:38:24] debating us it feels like you're all
[01:38:26] starting to count faster but that's all
[01:38:28] right I know it can be tiring to do such
[01:38:30] a long countdown 10 seconds and change
[01:38:33] is still plenty of
[01:38:36] time
[01:38:38] 10 almost there
[01:38:40] now swapping two people is harder work
[01:38:43] than you might think this this too long
[01:38:44] of a cut scene to just be a meme though
[01:38:45] so I feel like something's going to
[01:38:46] happen cuz it's been like [ __ ] 20
[01:38:48] minutes the first time hey wait is this
[01:38:51] the back one I can't tell they both look
[01:38:54] the same inside okay something's
[01:38:55] happening huh no that's not it I'll try
[01:39:00] again hey slow down honestly is
[01:39:07] entertained whoops that doesn't count
[01:39:10] was
[01:39:20] that
[01:39:23] K's kind of
[01:39:24] cute like a like a people happy cute he
[01:39:27] did it oh my God it's
[01:39:31] l oh my
[01:39:34] [Music]
[01:39:40] God oh my God it's show
[01:39:46] time that's part of the
[01:39:50] show what the
[01:39:55] [ __ ] what
[01:40:03] [Music]
[01:40:08] happened minus one
[01:40:10] NPC
[01:40:12] huh is this part of the
[01:40:15] show Mr Lenny you're going to use magic
[01:40:18] to fix the stage now right yeah yeah of
[01:40:20] course happened oh no maybe this isn't
[01:40:24] part of the
[01:40:25] show the girl was still in that box
[01:40:28] right this performance is over medical
[01:40:31] staff with me guards secure the scene
[01:40:33] and detain all the performers seal the
[01:40:35] exits no one is allowed in or out at
[01:40:38] this time okay I'm actually can you seal
[01:40:41] me up too I'm sorry I I know just an
[01:40:44] accident then we must investigate the
[01:40:46] cause but if this was all part of some
[01:40:49] scheme then then those accountable will
[01:40:52] not escape the
[01:40:54] Judgment Justice no need to be Al so
[01:40:57] true finina we'll get to the bottom of
[01:40:59] this soon
[01:41:02] enough okay the guards
[01:41:07] okay unfortunately the person who is in
[01:41:09] the magic box has been pronounced dead
[01:41:12] his name was Cowell one of the
[01:41:14] assistants who magic apparently the
[01:41:17] fireworks on stage ignited the ropes
[01:41:19] that were suspending the water tank then
[01:41:21] caused the tank to fall onto the stage
[01:41:23] what did cow do man we are still not
[01:41:25] sure why in the Box rather than the
[01:41:28] guest from the audience and after an
[01:41:31] initial search of the area the guards
[01:41:33] have confirmed that the girl is nowhere
[01:41:35] to be found minus it appears that this
[01:41:37] incident was not merely some mishap with
[01:41:39] the
[01:41:41] performance and there are many
[01:41:43] indications that it is connected with
[01:41:45] the case of the serial disappearances
[01:41:47] huh it's almost as if I could tell the
[01:41:50] serial disappearances
[01:41:53] case that's the case that Charlotte
[01:41:55] mentioned
[01:41:58] before I know I know the truth I can see
[01:42:03] through the whole thing really using
[01:42:06] such a shallow and obvious mystery as
[01:42:09] his finale did he really underestimate
[01:42:12] us that she figured out good job finina
[01:42:14] I say that our powerful magician Mr
[01:42:17] Linny is now the prime suspect for the
[01:42:20] serial disappearance wait is sus short
[01:42:23] for suspect oh no it's probably
[01:42:24] suspicious never mind huh why me this
[01:42:27] whole thing was an
[01:42:31] accident this all occurred during your
[01:42:34] magic show did it not the missing girl
[01:42:37] disappeared after being chosen did she
[01:42:40] not true the deas is one of your
[01:42:43] assistant true three for three fin I
[01:42:47] think about it that whole speech about
[01:42:49] magicians making things disappear was
[01:42:52] nothing more than a provocation a bald
[01:42:55] face challenge sure four for four I
[01:42:58] guess right how could Lenny do this he
[01:43:01] was in the Box on the stage the entire
[01:43:03] time we could even hear his voice
[01:43:06] besides before the show he told us that
[01:43:08] he would like to catch the criminal
[01:43:10] behind save discussion for a later time
[01:43:12] please lady finina may I assume that
[01:43:15] your comments just now constitute an
[01:43:17] accusation against Mr Linny and his
[01:43:19] associates that you are pressing charges
[01:43:23] huh I just think that oh she's just
[01:43:25] being goofy well I think it might be a
[01:43:29] little
[01:43:32] toes but what
[01:43:34] lady now makes perfect sense looks like
[01:43:37] she's going to personally deliver
[01:43:39] Justice she's just goofing around she's
[01:43:41] just being goofy murder carried out
[01:43:43] under the cover of a magic show lady
[01:43:45] finina said it
[01:43:48] all I mean of course my dear people but
[01:43:54] what excites me even more than the
[01:43:56] obvious truth before our eyes is the
[01:44:00] opponent I'll be The Gaslight archon
[01:44:04] that's right I mean you traveler you'll
[01:44:07] support Lenny won't you after all he why
[01:44:11] do I have to do this as a child I was
[01:44:14] taught to pick my
[01:44:16] battles if if there's something
[01:44:18] happening over there it's not my problem
[01:44:20] don't [ __ ] put me in this I don't
[01:44:22] know L like that we met like an hour
[01:44:27] ago then there's no problem at all you
[01:44:31] know the traveler and I already had a
[01:44:33] duel the first time we
[01:44:36] met and I won but with Lenny's help our
[01:44:40] little duel ended in a
[01:44:43] draw but draws really are the most
[01:44:47] boring possible
[01:44:49] outcome no more draws between the two of
[01:44:53] us there must be a clear winner and
[01:44:56] loser and what better place to hold such
[01:44:59] a riveting Showdown and decide the true
[01:45:02] Victor than here on the grand bro we
[01:45:05] literally fought Ryden why are you
[01:45:07] trying to fight us it wasn't a draw she
[01:45:11] obviously lost last time I understand
[01:45:16] charges have now been pressed we killed
[01:45:18] [ __ ] Scar's Mech with a doll blade
[01:45:22] well traveler seems lady finina has set
[01:45:24] you in her sights but putting her
[01:45:27] dramatic rhetoric aside for a moment I
[01:45:30] would like to ask you ask me anything
[01:45:32] I'm all yours to act as Mr linny's
[01:45:34] attorney and defend him in no why is
[01:45:36] there a no option why the [ __ ] would I
[01:45:38] defend Linny look I like Linny no I feel
[01:45:41] typing zck is my lawyer
[01:45:43] aware look at my lawyer going to jail
[01:45:47] skull skull sure I guess [ __ ] it I'll be
[01:45:50] a lawyer the trial will be held a day
[01:45:53] from now in the opera house okay cool
[01:45:54] both sides May investigate the scene to
[01:45:56] build their cases and search for the
[01:45:58] truth wait this literally is dong RPA
[01:46:00] all right well it's okay I've been
[01:46:02] playing I'm ready Linny and his troop
[01:46:04] are all potential suspects and shall
[01:46:07] remain within the Opera House the
[01:46:08] audience May begin to leave in an
[01:46:10] orderly fashion once they have been
[01:46:11] cleared by the guards a day isn't that
[01:46:15] long let's see what kind of case this
[01:46:18] big shot Outlander can build why you
[01:46:21] call me a big shot I didn't say anything
[01:46:23] you involved me in I was just watching
[01:46:25] the show eating my popcorn and now I'm
[01:46:27] in the middle of this Stuck in the
[01:46:30] Middle every is dismissed and the
[01:46:32] audience begins to leave along with
[01:46:33] finina and nette
[01:46:35] okay
[01:46:38] lny okay I I if if I'm Lum in here I'm
[01:46:41] like Lenny what the [ __ ] is wrong with
[01:46:43] you that happened just why am I in the
[01:46:44] middle of this were you frightened what
[01:46:46] do you mean were you you killed two
[01:46:48] people who wouldn't be scared after
[01:46:49] witnessing an accident like that yeah
[01:46:52] I'm a little shaken up
[01:46:55] myself how could this happen no he
[01:46:58] didn't well someone
[01:46:59] did I know you already claimed that you
[01:47:01] would defend me but now it's just us
[01:47:04] talking tell me do you think I could
[01:47:07] possibly be the murderer okay in all
[01:47:10] honesty you probably didn't killed me
[01:47:13] but I know you're connected to arlino
[01:47:15] cuz I watched the trailer and you have
[01:47:18] the [ __ ] little psychopath Hoka tear
[01:47:20] drop on your [ __ ] face so I don't
[01:47:21] know if I can trust you no disrespect I
[01:47:24] like you but I'm just saying be honest
[01:47:26] with me what happened over there just
[01:47:28] talk to me and we can figure this out
[01:47:30] together here thank you so much for
[01:47:32] trusting
[01:47:34] me I'm sure everyone sees me as the
[01:47:37] biggest suspect at this point but if you
[01:47:40] ask me the whole thing is Mysteries
[01:47:42] layered upon Mysteries such that all
[01:47:44] that's left is confusion I don't know
[01:47:48] whether what happened there on the stage
[01:47:49] was purely an an accident or not and I
[01:47:52] don't know why poor Cal was in the Box
[01:47:54] who the [ __ ] put cow in the Box how that
[01:47:56] girl chosen from the audience could
[01:47:57] suddenly
[01:47:58] disappear someone y the girl kidnapped
[01:48:02] cuz they're like doing a kidnapping
[01:48:03] thing I don't know why but whoever it is
[01:48:05] probably a [ __ ] fatou arino who knows
[01:48:07] kidnapped her and then [ __ ] chucked
[01:48:09] cowl in there poor cowl now cow's
[01:48:13] dead wait everyone with a mask dies it's
[01:48:17] like the [ __ ] Ena Zuma mask aware now
[01:48:19] this's the [ __ ] we another dude with the
[01:48:20] mask I was going to compare him to her
[01:48:22] but I forgot her name so I didn't and
[01:48:23] then he died
[01:48:25] too wait Shia oh no oh
[01:48:32] no sh no lose the mask no lose the mask
[01:48:35] sh that's precisely why we need to
[01:48:37] investigate as this book
[01:48:40] says the impossible could not have
[01:48:42] happened whatever happened must have
[01:48:45] been that which is
[01:48:46] possible what the
[01:48:49] [ __ ]
[01:48:51] Pon bought them when we were reading at
[01:48:53] the book shop in the city earlier pretty
[01:48:55] cool huh don't worry Pon used her own
[01:48:58] savings to buy actually not bad she
[01:49:02] actually looks better now I think they
[01:49:03] look cute on you Pon true Lynette you
[01:49:05] have good taste
[01:49:08] Lynette that's the right attitude
[01:49:11] feeling depressed isn't going to help me
[01:49:12] now I need to get back to normal self
[01:49:15] okay no way okay okay I get it like oh
[01:49:17] let's not grieve you know there's no
[01:49:19] point and just being sad all the time I
[01:49:21] get it but your assistant died
[01:49:24] like 2 minutes ago you can this does not
[01:49:28] feel sincere it's been like 2 minutes
[01:49:30] but with the guards watching our every
[01:49:32] move it's going to literally you have
[01:49:34] for I to prove our own
[01:49:36] innocence good thing you agreed to be
[01:49:38] our attorneys this like man that sucks
[01:49:41] for that anyways no time to be sad yes
[01:49:44] thank you so much I won't let you down
[01:49:45] lyette yeah just leave it to
[01:49:48] us oh uh since we're going to start
[01:49:52] investigating pman has a question first
[01:49:54] where did Lynette go during the
[01:49:57] performance oh well I'm afraid that
[01:50:00] would involve some of our essential
[01:50:02] Trade Secrets as magicians bro I'm your
[01:50:04] lawyer just tell me we literally have a
[01:50:06] legally binding contract I can't tell
[01:50:08] anyone I suppose [ __ ] tell me oh he's
[01:50:11] going to tell us the truth behind our
[01:50:12] tricks is going to be important evidence
[01:50:14] that will be waited during the trial
[01:50:16] true is truly a Pity as a magician our
[01:50:20] magic show is a work of art we've poured
[01:50:23] countless hours and spared no effort in
[01:50:25] perfecting it but if revealing our
[01:50:28] secrets will help you uncover the truth
[01:50:29] behind what happened then it will be
[01:50:31] well worth
[01:50:32] it we should go somewhere else if we're
[01:50:35] going to disc I thought this was like a
[01:50:37] a lighting thing in game but I've
[01:50:40] noticed that because my monitor on like
[01:50:41] valerant color settings it makes all my
[01:50:42] characters look like they have red skin
[01:50:44] and cut scenes which is really weird
[01:50:45] like it looks like they're like all
[01:50:46] sunburn are still here detective Pon is
[01:50:50] the case but like cuz when I put get on
[01:50:52] my second mon it looks normal but
[01:50:56] no hello officer how's the investigation
[01:51:01] going ah I see you must be the traveler
[01:51:05] that lady F mentioned come with me and
[01:51:08] you'll
[01:51:09] see the deceased is one of Lenny's
[01:51:12] assistant I guess I should listen listen
[01:51:14] even though he hadn't joined the troop
[01:51:15] long he was hardworking and can I unique
[01:51:18] Chad because it's kind of dies cringe
[01:51:19] yeah you can I trust you mods do
[01:51:20] whatever you do setting up and
[01:51:22] inspecting the props as well as
[01:51:23] assisting with the show and keeping the
[01:51:25] crowd engaged as you probably saw when
[01:51:29] you were in the audience the water tank
[01:51:32] suddenly fell and smashed the Box towel
[01:51:35] inside it just a question regarding
[01:51:37] safety uh regulations and etiquette um
[01:51:40] to my client Lenny why don't you just
[01:51:43] put the water box cuz you're not going
[01:51:44] to use it anymore why don't you just put
[01:51:45] the water box like over there and then
[01:51:47] the magic box here so then even if it
[01:51:49] falls it doesn't why are you putting it
[01:51:51] under the
[01:51:54] like is there a reason why it's above
[01:51:58] like all good this is the real mystery
[01:52:01] we've already searched the scene and we
[01:52:03] unable to find any traces of the girl
[01:52:05] look is that however if you look
[01:52:07] carefully the box was positioned
[01:52:08] directly under the water tank the ropes
[01:52:10] holding the tank were then burned by the
[01:52:12] pyrotechnics on stage causing them to
[01:52:14] snap all these factors lining up so
[01:52:17] perfectly makes it hard to see this as a
[01:52:19] mere AC inent if anything the more
[01:52:21] logical explanation is that the whole
[01:52:23] incident was intentionally planned
[01:52:25] intentionally planned the most likely
[01:52:26] person to have access to all these areas
[01:52:29] but he doesn't have a
[01:52:31] motive unless are you both good friends
[01:52:35] of his we just met him well you can't
[01:52:38] say we're good friends so in just a
[01:52:40] short time he was not only able to win
[01:52:42] your trust but this guy's making a lot
[01:52:44] of good points right now I know there's
[01:52:47] no such thing as magic the real trick of
[01:52:50] a magician is holding the audience in
[01:52:52] the palm of their hand you know this guy
[01:52:55] is making some good points a lot of
[01:52:56] cases and I can tell you that people are
[01:52:59] the least reliable kind of
[01:53:02] evidence sorry I tend to be pretty
[01:53:05] straightforward anyway you may
[01:53:06] investigate the scene of the crime
[01:53:08] yourselves if you're curious who knows
[01:53:10] maybe you'll be able to come up with
[01:53:11] some new this guy looks like
[01:53:13] Kos wait does he wait let me look at him
[01:53:16] case record okay perception skill
[01:53:22] okay I should probably read these uh
[01:53:24] this is on of lenn's assistants named
[01:53:27] cowl it doesn't
[01:53:32] matter wait where was he I want to look
[01:53:34] at
[01:53:37] him wait does he actually look like
[01:53:39] kamos let me look at him go ahead no he
[01:53:42] does look around in the end we're both
[01:53:44] after the
[01:53:46] truth he does it he does it chill he
[01:53:48] does it Hees
[01:53:51] all right let's examine the magic box
[01:53:53] the broken Magic Box was wait we need
[01:53:55] some detective music one sec
[01:54:08] chat all
[01:54:10] right the broken Magic BL was left on
[01:54:12] scene after the guards completed their
[01:54:14] investigation this low no it's
[01:54:17] fine okay uh let me press e
[01:54:22] who H in the white lines this is where
[01:54:26] the magic box was struck if cowl wasn't
[01:54:28] inside the box he might have dodged
[01:54:36] it what's up
[01:54:38] Quenton isn't that Tarantino's name the
[01:54:41] investigation team has some new findings
[01:54:43] turns out there's an issue with the
[01:54:45] random number selector after all see
[01:54:48] told you what if the machine some big
[01:54:52] you think the murderer would have still
[01:54:53] made his move then sorry to interrupt
[01:54:56] but we don't think lny and Lynette with
[01:54:58] their side of the investigation what
[01:55:00] were you saying about the number
[01:55:02] selector number selector something wrong
[01:55:04] with it you're trying to help them
[01:55:07] that'll be a a little loud it's louder
[01:55:09] than the [ __ ] game I'm sorry Lenny
[01:55:11] used the machine to pick a random member
[01:55:13] of the audience during his performance
[01:55:15] right a lucky girl that later
[01:55:17] disappeared well we thought there might
[01:55:20] be a serious problem with the machine so
[01:55:22] we had it taken away for further
[01:55:23] inspection it turns out that the seat
[01:55:26] number it picked wasn't random at all
[01:55:28] the machine picks that same number every
[01:55:31] time sure you already know that you have
[01:55:34] to make a reservation in advance to get
[01:55:36] a seat regardless of whether it's a
[01:55:38] trial or some performance in other words
[01:55:40] Linny knew who would be sitting where
[01:55:42] from the very beginning you know that is
[01:55:44] pretty daming evidence but what if Lenny
[01:55:45] just didn't know checks out oh never
[01:55:47] mind Lenny reserved our seats for us hm
[01:55:50] interesting why I was saying it' be
[01:55:52] tough to make a case so he knew where
[01:55:55] everyone would be is what you're saying
[01:55:58] even
[01:56:01] H it someone tappered with
[01:56:05] it okay okay you know that is a pretty
[01:56:08] that is some pretty damning
[01:56:11] evidence let me look uh over
[01:56:15] here so this is the rope that broke and
[01:56:17] caused the water tank to fall right now
[01:56:21] H 100 gifted the Rope looks pretty
[01:56:23] durable how can it be burned through so
[01:56:26] quickly by
[01:56:27] fireworks H why are you suddenly so
[01:56:30] serious
[01:56:32] traveler
[01:56:34] H
[01:56:38] interesting look this bit is made from
[01:56:41] different material most of it was burned
[01:56:43] away but there's still a little bit of
[01:56:45] it left it seems to be
[01:56:48] flamable both meant to hold something
[01:56:51] was made with that kind of material in
[01:56:53] it then I'm
[01:56:57] not why W you write all this down yeah
[01:56:59] just check the Monokuma file true it'll
[01:57:01] tell us how he
[01:57:03] died something bro
[01:57:06] the material oh so not all of the RO
[01:57:09] just where it's snapped well maybe all
[01:57:10] of the Roe but it says the
[01:57:14] location H that is interesting okay
[01:57:18] let's talk to this guy what up
[01:57:21] Maurice hello there what are you
[01:57:24] investigating pause the
[01:57:26] music oh this location has also been
[01:57:29] cordon off because the magic troop
[01:57:31] members are currently considered Prime
[01:57:33] suspects the investigation team is still
[01:57:35] collecting evidence the seats were all
[01:57:37] booked in advance so we were able to
[01:57:40] deduce the hey can you tell us who the
[01:57:41] woman is sure it's not like this is
[01:57:43] confidential her name is Hy she's a
[01:57:45] painter from Fontaine who's made a bit
[01:57:47] of a name for herself okay
[01:57:50] apparently she wasn't a regular at the
[01:57:52] opera house but she'd been feeling some
[01:57:53] pressure with her work lately which made
[01:57:55] her decide to come see the mag magic
[01:57:57] troop members all claim not to know her
[01:57:59] we have looked into her social
[01:58:00] connections it seems that she has no
[01:58:02] personal grievances or conflicts of
[01:58:04] interest with the suspects simply put
[01:58:07] she wasn't related to the magic troop at
[01:58:08] all which matches the features of the
[01:58:10] previous serial disappearances hey were
[01:58:13] the victims of previous cases also
[01:58:15] choosen at random that's how it seems to
[01:58:17] us in any case apart from the fact that
[01:58:20] they were all young women of young women
[01:58:23] of around the same age range so formal
[01:58:25] if you do happen to see the missing girl
[01:58:27] please be sure to contact us it is of
[01:58:30] utmost importance that we get to the
[01:58:31] bottom of these
[01:58:34] disappearances how person she's a famous
[01:58:36] painter and she came to watch the show
[01:58:37] in order to take a break from her
[01:58:39] work
[01:58:44] D okay well that is a okay that's a clue
[01:58:54] what up
[01:58:56] Eldor I see that you're investigating
[01:58:58] the area well it just so happens that
[01:59:01] I'm interested too it's okay no one
[01:59:03] cares find any new and
[01:59:05] interesting you're not going to help in
[01:59:07] the case five gifted says this guy does
[01:59:09] not actually help have too many thoughts
[01:59:12] yet then why don't I tell you my
[01:59:14] hypothesis first the thud Oh you mean
[01:59:18] the sound that happen during the
[01:59:20] countdown yes exactly it wasn't terribly
[01:59:24] loud but I suspect that most people
[01:59:26] heard it okay there was a everyone was
[01:59:29] awaiting the results of Lenny's trick
[01:59:30] with baited breath so no one paid it
[01:59:33] much mind I paid much
[01:59:35] mind that makes sense I'm of the opinion
[01:59:38] that it may have been the sound of
[01:59:39] Lenny's accomplice Lynette perhaps
[01:59:42] jumping a top the water tank or
[01:59:44] something like that and when the pyrate
[01:59:46] Technics went off she cut the rope
[01:59:49] sending the water tank crashing down but
[01:59:52] wasn't the noise we heard too loud for
[01:59:54] that perhaps the balance wasn't right
[01:59:58] leading to a particularly rough
[02:00:00] Landing yeah when I jump on something it
[02:00:02] does a true oh that's
[02:00:06] true [ __ ] idiot bro that does remind
[02:00:10] Pon though the only thing this guy said
[02:00:12] was yeah remember the bang
[02:00:15] sound I mean true but his whole guess
[02:00:18] was dog [ __ ] if if I had abilities I
[02:00:19] would use them on them what's what
[02:00:21] weapon am I using wait does it key my
[02:00:23] weapon it does uh what should we equip
[02:00:26] her with dll blade is too lower accurate
[02:00:28] we need something
[02:00:29] funny There You
[02:00:31] Go
[02:00:35] POG Magic

[02:00:41] moved instantly from the stage how did
[02:00:42] you do
[02:00:43] it what if there's a trap
[02:00:46] door no but it was like 2 seconds he

[02:01:16] have a lot of explaining to do I think
[02:01:18] someone will be sign to monitor us later
[02:01:20] but that's all right I was going to
[02:01:23] watch that there's a lot more to it

[02:02:10] you mean us that's right if I'm not
[02:02:13] mistaken also among those who wish to

[02:02:24] Fontaine well you're right on the mor

[02:02:40] conundrums you name it Spina rosula does
[02:02:43] it and I Navia have the honor of being
[02:02:47] its renowned president
[02:02:49] okay I mean she's cool so those who play

[02:03:22] Navia is fine okay Navia okay if you say
[02:03:26] so not that we're members of spina dula
[02:03:30] anyway all nearly trifling details never
[02:03:34] mind now back to the situation at hand
[02:03:37] that's right I've always kept an eye on
[02:03:39] the serial disappearance cases my
[02:03:41] interest stems from a matter back from
[02:03:43] my father's time judging from the look
[02:03:45] of things I find Linny an unlikely
[02:03:49] Mastermind what does everyone like
[02:03:51] silver too that's why we're looking for
[02:03:53] Clues now but how did you come to that
[02:03:56] conclusion intuition naturally my
[02:04:00] unparalleled
[02:04:01] intuition wow finina sure was quick to
[02:04:04] point the finger at Linny without any
[02:04:05] decisive evidence whatsoever yeah she's
[02:04:07] just silly like that don't worry about
[02:04:09] her she's just pretty goofy that's not
[02:04:11] uncommon for her if you remember the
[02:04:14] Justice had to interrupt her and ask if
[02:04:15] she was pressing charges just to keep
[02:04:17] her from getting carried away way anyway
[02:04:20] a trial Begins the moment someone levels
[02:04:22] charges and of course there was no way
[02:04:25] for Reena was going to back down in that
[02:04:27] situation sounds more like you just
[02:04:29] don't trust the hydro archon well what's
[02:04:33] your opinion I must admit that she can
[02:04:35] be interesting at times but liking her
[02:04:38] doesn't mean that I'll agree with her
[02:04:41] all right I've answered your question
[02:04:44] now it's time you answer mine wait a
[02:04:46] minute did that answer count well I say
[02:04:50] it does but don't worry you won't hear
[02:04:53] any pointless questions from me in your
[02:04:56] opinion do you think it's right to treat
[02:04:58] a trial like it's an opera um well so
[02:05:02] there is more G than entire nights of
[02:05:04] fonus and my lith combined dude she's
[02:05:07] just a live streamer you know the people
[02:05:08] that like they'll have like a like you
[02:05:11] know the people that'll like stream
[02:05:12] their like relationship problems for
[02:05:14] views it's literally finina she just
[02:05:16] does that for trials they're like oh
[02:05:18] there's drama in my life let me stream
[02:05:20] it and then they turn the live stream on
[02:05:21] and they're like wow my girlfriend I
[02:05:24] cheated on her and then they talk about
[02:05:25] it cuz they're [ __ ] weird and then
[02:05:27] that's like the whole thing and then
[02:05:28] they make videos on it that's finina but
[02:05:31] I like finina see silver she's just a
[02:05:33] live streamer I told you they'd be
[02:05:36] different most dute of you demoiselle I
[02:05:39] too think that the Traveler's response
[02:05:41] was most excellent no matter how
[02:05:44] wonderful the script or how fervent the
[02:05:46] audience's expectations may be the
[02:05:49] trials that go on stage here must be
[02:05:51] based in fact then if that can be done
[02:05:54] boss
[02:05:56] then all right that's quite enough Malo
[02:06:00] anyway I like your answer you passed
[02:06:02] with flying colors now I feel like fin
[02:06:06] some preparations following which our
[02:06:08] joint investigation shall commence feel
[02:06:10] like Fin's a very shall be my
[02:06:13] assistant oh well I can be the assistant
[02:06:17] sure or your companion if you like I'm
[02:06:21] really not that fussy oh never mind
[02:06:24] that's more like it far be it for me to
[02:06:26] brag but I believe that deo's intuition
[02:06:30] will be instrumental and UNC you wish to
[02:06:32] save a friend from false accusations and
[02:06:35] we wish to unravel the
[02:06:38] disappearances you have a point you have
[02:06:40] a point you're quite I what about you
[02:06:43] over there what do you think yeah what's
[02:06:45] up Sil you got something on your mind
[02:06:47] okay the shades are growing on on
[02:06:49] me I have nothing to add okay oh all
[02:06:53] righty then thanks
[02:06:55] man we'll be making some preparations
[02:06:58] first just be sure to let us know if
[02:07:01] they start revealing Lenny's tricks she
[02:07:03] has the same hair as bro
[02:07:08] thanks okay so na'vi is just [ __ ]
[02:07:10] chilling here that's pretty cool I like
[02:07:12] her hat I actually like her hat a
[02:07:17] lot
[02:07:19] I feel like finina so far very
[02:07:22] interesting
[02:07:23] character which makes her make me like
[02:07:26] [ __ ] which makes me like her as a
[02:07:27] character but I feel like if she was
[02:07:28] like real she'd be annoying as [ __ ] does
[02:07:31] that make sense like if that was really
[02:07:32] how courts were decided I'd be like dude
[02:07:34] what the [ __ ] is this garbage but
[02:07:36] because it's a game I'm like okay that's
[02:07:37] pretty funny you wish to leave you must
[02:07:39] register your identity with us first so
[02:07:40] like I like her indention but if she was
[02:07:42] like real I'd be like this is kind of I
[02:07:45] don't know how I feel about her so we're
[02:07:46] investigating the case not to spoil but
[02:07:49] Sil is shling of font true Opa Exel
[02:07:53] after the Chief Justice gave the order
[02:07:55] everyone coming in or out must undergo a
[02:07:58] strict inspection so the missing girl
[02:08:01] couldn't have left from here at least
[02:08:03] not from that point
[02:08:05] on she like I'll hi him you be able to
[02:08:07] stand her IRL no I'll height them like
[02:08:09] he's pretty
[02:08:13] like like he's kind of like socially
[02:08:15] doesn't give a [ __ ] but he's like I feel
[02:08:17] like he's like like I feel like he has
[02:08:19] like good qualities I'm not saying
[02:08:22] finina doesn't I'm saying she like she
[02:08:25] would she would make her whole nation's
[02:08:26] court system do like just like a theater
[02:08:29] show for fun cuz she's silly and goofy
[02:08:32] which I like as a genin player I'm like
[02:08:34] hey this is cool but if that was like my
[02:08:36] real archon in real life and that's how
[02:08:38] my courts were I'd be
[02:08:42] like I doubt there was much opportunity
[02:08:45] then either how can you be so
[02:08:51] sure well because I was in charge of
[02:08:54] security near the entrance at that time
[02:08:57] I couldn't see Lenny's performance from
[02:08:59] here which was quite a shame just my but
[02:09:02] still I did not abandon my post and I
[02:09:04] stayed put no matter how loud the
[02:09:06] applause was if someone had so much as
[02:09:09] even approached the door I would have
[02:09:12] noticed it let alone if they had tried
[02:09:14] to okay so no one could have left or
[02:09:16] entered are good is that what that means
[02:09:18] it's safe to say the or maybe enter I
[02:09:20] don't know if she's talking about enter
[02:09:21] but no could have
[02:09:23] left no one left it didn't mention if
[02:09:26] someone entered but there no one left
[02:09:30] okay everything of no the right let's go

[02:09:50] Lynette all she's like magic stto and
[02:09:52] then she
[02:09:53] Magics and making notes as necessary

[02:10:40] grateful well let's just say we're
[02:10:43] tagging along it's not every day you get
[02:10:45] to see the secrets behind magic
[02:10:47] performed on such such a large scale I
[02:10:50] like her eyes it's like a St okay I
[02:10:52] appreciate your kind interest dude her
[02:10:54] eyes okay I don't know if I'm brain
[02:10:56] rotted from genin but Lynette's eyes
[02:10:58] literally look like the spiral Abyss
[02:10:59] like when you click on like the floor 9
[02:11:01] and it shows like the the purple circle
[02:11:03] it literally I can't stop seeing that
[02:11:05] stage yes a but before I everything you
[02:11:09] should have a look first notice anything
[02:11:11] strange
[02:11:12] here look it's literally [ __ ] spiral
[02:11:15] of
[02:11:17] this
[02:11:20] I'm not trying to be dramatic
[02:11:22] remembering the details of a trick will
[02:11:24] help you understand the methods used to
[02:11:25] perform it more
[02:11:27] easily huh weren't there balloons and
[02:11:31] other decorations here where did that
[02:11:34] true where are the balloons ah good eye
[02:11:37] that said you're still far from
[02:11:39] discovering the answer back of the door
[02:11:41] is not the same the back you mean the
[02:11:44] inside of the
[02:11:46] door very good indeed
[02:11:48] I thought you might not be able to catch
[02:11:50] that given that the back of this door
[02:11:52] was patterned those patterns are now
[02:11:54] gone repl FL May wouldn't board so if
[02:11:58] you put two and two together what do you
[02:12:01] get there's another box inside of the
[02:12:03] Box exactly all right let's go
[02:12:08] I'll four yes two and two together is
[02:12:11] four so there was a passageway under the
[02:12:14] magic box wait I literally called that
[02:12:16] there's a trapo under but that still
[02:12:17] doesn't explain how a TP within like 2
[02:12:19] seconds cuz there's no way he would run
[02:12:20] all there therefore he has another twin
[02:12:22] brother
[02:12:23] true I knew you'd figure out most of it
[02:12:26] as soon as you saw this place I
[02:12:28] literally called it but there's no way
[02:12:29] he does all this oh he used a way point
[02:12:32] [ __ ] he has a portable Waypoint of
[02:12:34] course see this the box with a lucky
[02:12:37] audience member in it the loading screen
[02:12:39] to the other side using how fast is PC
[02:12:42] cuz what if he got stuck on the Geo
[02:12:43] symbol uring that the in the right
[02:12:47] direction I see so that's the purpose of
[02:12:51] the Box inside another box yep precisely
[02:12:55] the inner box would descend after the
[02:12:57] audience member was put inside and be
[02:12:59] moved along the trolley all while the
[02:13:01] outer box would remain on stage as if
[02:13:03] nothing had ever changed so that's how
[02:13:06] you did it once the box was lowered the
[02:13:09] trolley would store some energy through
[02:13:11] this device here with which it would
[02:13:13] complete the rest of the steps the
[02:13:15] audience member would only be able to
[02:13:17] feel some slight movements in the dark
[02:13:19] and by the time she walked out she would
[02:13:22] already be back on stage okay what about
[02:13:25] you right you were talking that whole
[02:13:27] time ah yes a phonograph operated by
[02:13:30] Lynette was used to achieve that effect
[02:13:32] wait you literally stepped out of the
[02:13:33] box though my assistant and I had
[02:13:36] already scripted our conversation
[02:13:37] beforehand when the countdown began I
[02:13:40] had already gone to the opposite box via
[02:13:42] a tunnel using that ladder and what
[02:13:45] about Lynette where was she
[02:13:49] I was in the mezzanine space in the back
[02:13:51] of the
[02:13:52] box oh that's how we were able to
[02:13:54] coordinate Lenny's lines with the
[02:13:56] assistant and by the way I love I was
[02:13:59] the one who walked out of the box at the
[02:14:01] end I mean we are twins all it takes is
[02:14:04] a change of clothes and no one can tell
[02:14:06] who's who bro you have a mark all good
[02:14:12] also she has cat ears but I guess you
[02:14:14] could wear a hat over it true okay fair
[02:14:16] enough I guess
[02:14:21] and that's my favorite part of this
[02:14:23] trick only Lynette and I can perform
[02:14:28] it so that's how it all worked wow every
[02:14:33] detail you Ral more amazing than the
[02:14:35] last Lynette would briefly walk out of
[02:14:37] the box and then go back in jumping into
[02:14:40] the tunnel and escaping before okay
[02:14:42] whoever designed this Quest literally
[02:14:44] watch The Prestige I'm not even [ __ ]
[02:14:46] kidding go watch the movie me and the
[02:14:48] trick I like the movie so it's not like
[02:14:50] a bad thing word here being would but as
[02:14:54] you saw Cal was in the Box not our
[02:14:56] audience member she on the other hand
[02:15:00] mysteriously vanished we really don't
[02:15:02] know how that
[02:15:05] happened if not for that interlude this
[02:15:08] would have been an astonishing trick I
[02:15:11] probably never would have figured out
[02:15:12] how you pulled it
[02:15:14] off and yet to think that someone was
[02:15:17] able to use this magic trick to commit a
[02:15:20] crime could we have a look around I
[02:15:23] think we can come up with some more
[02:15:24] leads B is the scene of the crime so
[02:15:27] Linny and Lynette are not permitted to
[02:15:29] stay here I'll escort them back up yes
[02:15:32] of course no need to be so strict now I
[02:15:35] won't disappear Into Thin Air you know
[02:15:37] suspicious thanks everyone we're
[02:15:39] counting on
[02:15:41] you by using a box out of the box the
[02:15:44] idea was for the Box containing the
[02:15:45] audience member to be transported across
[02:15:46] VI a tunnel underneath and L would use
[02:15:48] thisel to go the side M having her
[02:15:49] changer outfit Lynette and assistant
[02:15:51] would take charge of onstage
[02:15:59] interactions cool it
[02:16:03] sorry I still don't have my phone I mean
[02:16:05] I don't need it
[02:16:13] but uh let's examine the
[02:16:16] clothing
[02:16:23] oh these are the clothes that the lady
[02:16:25] chosen from the audience was wearing
[02:16:27] right her clothes are here but she's
[02:16:30] nowhere to be found wait
[02:16:34] what right and do you really need to do
[02:16:38] that if you're kidnapping them G this is
[02:16:42] so confusing P doesn't want to be a
[02:16:44] detective
[02:16:46] anymore the [ __ ] they just yoink their
[02:16:55] clothes
[02:16:58] sus huh what's this looks like a hook
[02:17:04] it's roadhog from OverWatch he he has
[02:17:06] the fisherman skin on Ice fisherman
[02:17:08] which you could buy during uh winter and
[02:17:10] then it
[02:17:11] could perhaps it was a prop for a
[02:17:14] different trick but why would it have
[02:17:17] been left left
[02:17:18] here whatever it is let's make let's
[02:17:24] make that could be Pon I
[02:17:28] think
[02:17:30] vase the floor is wet please be careful
[02:17:33] not to sleep speaking of which why would
[02:17:38] there be water here oh hi my nose it's
[02:17:41] one and here's a broken
[02:17:44] face
[02:17:46] H that can't be the trolley moves along
[02:17:50] tracks from start to finish it couldn't
[02:17:52] have hit the vase at this
[02:17:55] distance let's note this down too vase
[02:17:58] with
[02:18:00] water got
[02:18:02] hit
[02:18:06] okay all right um I'm happy that it
[02:18:10] shows a check mark over the ones that
[02:18:11] you already did because uh in dong and
[02:18:14] RPA it doesn't and I get I'm too [ __ ]
[02:18:16] stupid to remember so I keep going over
[02:18:17] the same clue like 50 times before
[02:18:20] finding the new one a ladder is required
[02:18:22] in order to return to the magic box
[02:18:24] above okay
[02:18:34] cool high Precision is
[02:18:38] required okay is that
[02:18:46] it I think
[02:18:49] so unless I'm missing one let me just
[02:18:51] look one more
[02:18:53] time it looks like that is unless
[02:18:55] there's some here I didn't really check
[02:18:57] here okay there's okay well there's a
[02:19:00] lot more storage boxes all kinds of
[02:19:02] props and cumes are halfly stuffed
[02:19:06] inside okay what about here examine the
[02:19:10] trolley trolley
[02:19:13] is
[02:19:15] okay uhoh what is this place a
[02:19:22] vent it seems someone could fit through
[02:19:24] here huh could this have been the
[02:19:27] suspect's Escape Route alone perhaps but
[02:19:32] if they had to there are no other ways
[02:19:34] in or out of here oh you're right let
[02:19:38] Pon write that down yeah the magic boxes
[02:19:41] okay okay there's a tunnel vent noted
[02:19:46] now we can get out of here investigating
[02:19:48] down
[02:19:49] here yes let's head back
[02:20:04] up I like
[02:20:07] it [ __ ] K let me
[02:20:10] out bro let me out can I not climb the
[02:20:13] [ __ ] do I have to go to the other
[02:20:14] ladder okay
[02:20:16] whatever haha there's two ladders but
[02:20:18] only one works whether someone relates
[02:20:21] this quest to dangan Rona or Ace
[02:20:23] Attorney says a lot about them as a
[02:20:25] person oh I just haven't played a attor
[02:20:27] I played Ona though not all of them but
[02:20:30] so I don't know which one it would be
[02:20:31] more like I just know that this is like
[02:20:33] we've Asain the state of the crime scene
[02:20:35] let's find a place to sort out our
[02:20:37] findings once Malo Returns the [ __ ] is
[02:20:39] Meo there are several things that don't
[02:20:42] add up here him apologies for the wait
[02:20:45] demoiselle oh apologies for the weight
[02:20:48] what did the guards say did
[02:20:51] the they believe I'm [ __ ] British
[02:20:55] I've got to take a ship's basement okay
[02:20:59] the guards have checked the area
[02:21:00] carefully no one left through the
[02:21:02] basement during the performance or after
[02:21:04] the incident and no one was found hiding
[02:21:07] there so the tunnels become like a
[02:21:10] secret chamber then you know like the
[02:21:12] kind you usually see in
[02:21:16] novels
[02:21:18] H's disappearance and cow's death
[02:21:22] are a p to those who know no wonder
[02:21:25] finina was so confident in her act in
[02:21:27] other words the charges are very likely
[02:21:29] to be upheld unless we make some
[02:21:31] considerable progress charges and then
[02:21:35] trial so if the charges are upheld
[02:21:37] they'll announce a sentence that's right
[02:21:40] this is how a trial goes in the opera
[02:21:42] house during the proceedings the Chief
[02:21:44] Justice and the orries will hear
[02:21:46] statements from both sides dude silver
[02:21:49] does not look like code I'm sorry I
[02:21:51] guess like the hair color maybe but the
[02:21:52] rest does not look like him that's right
[02:21:55] this code looks like uh okay the one
[02:21:57] fatou member that I don't know his name
[02:21:59] cuz I always call him okay code looks
[02:22:00] like okay pantalone looks like okay code
[02:22:02] the other one the audience's emotions
[02:22:04] will all be projected on the orrice to
[02:22:07] put it simply it's as if the orrice has
[02:22:09] its own will and is a judge in its own
[02:22:12] right this also precludes any kind of
[02:22:15] favoritism on the part of the chief
[02:22:16] judge Justice and not that this has ever
[02:22:19] happened anyway once both sides have
[02:22:21] finished speaking the Chief Justice will
[02:22:23] make his final decision then finally the
[02:22:27] orrice will be consulted by officials
[02:22:30] the result it returns is the will of
[02:22:32] Justice itself huh so that machine is
[02:22:36] the one that actually decides in
[02:22:38] practice there is very little difference
[02:22:40] both of always come to the same oh
[02:22:42] there's no in
[02:22:45] this like you can have like judges that
[02:22:47] write their opinions a lot of them they
[02:22:49] a lot of them they'll be like five
[02:22:50] judges agree and then one's like some
[02:22:52] random idiot who's like oh actually and
[02:22:53] then they'll write like an essay of why
[02:22:55] he doesn't agree and then like no one
[02:22:57] cares and no one ever cites it but
[02:22:58] sometimes it's informative and sometimes
[02:22:59] it's cool but here is what it
[02:23:03] is huh
[02:23:05] why because we've chosen to act as the
[02:23:08] twins proxies that makes us persons
[02:23:11] related they're concerned that we might
[02:23:13] be colluding with outside parties or
[02:23:15] that we might find Outside help to
[02:23:16] disrupt the case and even if that were
[02:23:19] not so it could prove problematic if we
[02:23:21] happen to spread key information about
[02:23:23] the case ahead of time I'm ready to
[02:23:25] break out at any time who whoa there's
[02:23:28] no need for that P thinks they have a
[02:23:30] point that said are they providing food
[02:23:33] of course I just hope you don't mind the
[02:23:36] lack of options I'm in let's just sort
[02:23:40] out
[02:23:42] our and over some tea and
[02:23:45] sweets breing out doesn't seem just
[02:23:48] kidding just kidding P will still do her
[02:23:51] best even if there are no snacks H what
[02:23:54] do you mean no snacks of course we'll
[02:23:57] have snacks if we cannot buy some then
[02:23:59] we'll simply make some okay chat
[02:24:01] respectfully and I mean this with
[02:24:03] literally the most respect possible
[02:24:05] genuinely like genuinely respectfully I
[02:24:08] just
[02:24:09] now
[02:24:11] noticed how do I say this nicely I
[02:24:13] noticed Navia thighs I just wanted to
[02:24:14] mention it in case you're like oh I just
[02:24:17] want to mention it no no like
[02:24:19] disrespectfully compliments to the
[02:24:21] artist that's I'm saying the fancy
[02:24:23] strikes her I have eggs sugar and
[02:24:26] almonds at the ready Cool good work you
[02:24:29] two then I'll get to it please sit tight
[02:24:32] for a moment you'll get to taste my
[02:24:34] awesome snack soon enough these three
[02:24:36] are quite the interesting
[02:24:39] group Navia me methodically handles the
[02:24:42] ingredients and pulls fresh macaroons
[02:24:44] out of the she made us macaroons smell
[02:24:46] good one Ryden can't do that Ry would
[02:24:49] have burnt the [ __ ] High House Down
[02:24:51] can't stop dring dud Mac are so good way
[02:24:54] you had these two guys carrying all that
[02:24:56] stuff around hman thought you'd have
[02:24:58] them do more during the baking
[02:25:02] process macaron not macaroon shut the
[02:25:05] [ __ ] up no one asked you I'm
[02:25:08] sorry I'm sorry I was
[02:25:11] applauding and I was giving encouraging
[02:25:14] smile my was just thinking
[02:25:17] aren't you worried about getting your
[02:25:18] fancy dress dirty beating egg whites and
[02:25:20] baking like
[02:25:22] this well I don't think it's carved in
[02:25:25] stone anywhere that fancy ladies can
[02:25:27] only read books sip tea ride horses and
[02:25:29] play the piano true I just really enjoy
[02:25:32] making snacks don't underestimate
[02:25:34] beating egg weights by the way it's a
[02:25:36] real arm workout true you also need to
[02:25:38] beat them to just the right consistency
[02:25:41] or your macarons will crack anyway give
[02:25:44] these a try fresh out of the oven
[02:25:46] there's three for each of us only well
[02:25:49] eating too it's actually better to hand
[02:25:51] whisk your egg Whit or your whipped
[02:25:53] cream because it leaves more like air
[02:25:55] pockets in it whereas a a mechanical
[02:25:57] electric blender will actually like do
[02:25:59] it too fast and there'll be no more air
[02:26:00] in it it'll be less fluffy true and uh
[02:26:03] uh Taylor Swift whatever her name is
[02:26:04] Navia knows that fragrance that clears
[02:26:07] the mind and lifts the spirit no need
[02:26:10] for concern
[02:26:15] I all right then
[02:26:18] down to business as Pimon mentioned
[02:26:21] previously the tunnel seems to be
[02:26:23] something of a secret chamber however we
[02:26:27] can assume that Linny and Lynette were
[02:26:28] not alone within it some criminal
[02:26:32] occupied at sealed confines the magician
[02:26:34] twins could have committed the crimes of
[02:26:36] course but they lack any logical motive
[02:26:40] exactly it's funny cuz the real Taylor
[02:26:42] swi likes baking them out yeah uh the
[02:26:43] one time yeah yeah yeah last time I hung
[02:26:46] out with Taylor she actually made me
[02:26:47] some snacks cuz she's like yo you're a
[02:26:48] big inspiration of mine no big deal but
[02:26:50] yeah I knew that too so that's pretty
[02:26:51] cool anyways apart from the twins we're
[02:26:53] left with two other people the missing
[02:26:54] girl in the decease tro flower vase and
[02:26:56] the thud we heard during the performance
[02:26:58] could indicate some altercation between
[02:27:00] Hy and the criminal in the tunnel
[02:27:02] resulting in the shattering of the vase
[02:27:04] the discarding of her clothes and her
[02:27:06] abduction perhaps the criminal thought
[02:27:08] that since she was chosen from the crowd
[02:27:10] she would be too easy to identify if she
[02:27:12] was still wearing the same clothes Pon
[02:27:15] thinks that makes sense but the real
[02:27:18] trouble
[02:27:19] is there's no person there's no evidence
[02:27:21] that this third person even exists true
[02:27:25] none of the clues we found thus far
[02:27:26] support the existence of this third
[02:27:28] person but the only people left to
[02:27:31] consider are both technically victims
[02:27:34] whether it's the missing girl cow isn't
[02:27:36] actually dead and he
[02:27:38] kidnapped could Hol have secretly made
[02:27:41] modifications to the magic props in
[02:27:43] order to murder cowl before making her
[02:27:46] Escape
[02:27:48] that's right and even if she had
[02:27:50] tampered with the setup she would need
[02:27:52] to understand the entire trick to pull
[02:27:54] it off nor does she have any motive the
[02:27:57] guards said that she has never had any
[02:27:59] dealings with the magic troops
[02:28:01] members were we not th enough in our
[02:28:04] search from the sound of things this is
[02:28:06] turning into a your macarons are amazing
[02:28:08] though
[02:28:09] n
[02:28:11] great they are my specialty after all
[02:28:14] what five oh that can't be right
[02:28:19] P please don't worry about it at my age
[02:28:23] a few less sweets might actually be a
[02:28:25] good
[02:28:27] thing Pon ate too many Being Greedy is
[02:28:29] one thing but Pon knows how to counts
[02:28:32] besides Pon knows that if she ate too
[02:28:34] many then others wouldn't have enough
[02:28:36] wait even you don't believe Pon if Pon
[02:28:39] ate those two ex nobody cares about the
[02:28:42] [ __ ] Ma how did we get it well I
[02:28:45] suppose one of us might have gotten too
[02:28:46] engrossed in our chat and eaten them by
[02:28:48] mistake no Bose set up the stove again
[02:28:51] if you would huh making sure everyone
[02:28:54] gets three macarons of
[02:28:57] course exactly we don't want to trouble
[02:29:00] you as you wish de and I have the surely
[02:29:03] this is important to the story and
[02:29:05] someone ate two macaroons cuz if not why
[02:29:07] would this be a whole ass cut scene
[02:29:09] surely if this has nothing to do with
[02:29:11] anything I'll be pissed surely someone
[02:29:12] ate the oh it was a cat oh silly goose I
[02:29:15] don't know what we're looking for yet
[02:29:17] but we've still got some time as
[02:29:20] attorneys I suggest the two of you think
[02:29:22] the case over again it would be awkward
[02:29:25] if you got all tongue tied on stage
[02:29:26] during the trial maybe we're just
[02:29:29] nervous around you wz for the SN it was
[02:29:32] nothing a small task for the Spina D
[02:29:34] rosula Silver Malo it's time to go I'll
[02:29:38] be back if I find anything
[02:29:40] new uh probably a third person being
[02:29:42] involved neither K nor how had a motive
[02:29:44] but after talking to Navia later a third
[02:29:46] person seeing seems very
[02:29:51] low all right it's time to put our heads
[02:29:54] together we've got to get our defense
[02:29:56] ready for the trial wait until the
[02:29:57] following
[02:29:58] day
[02:30:00] okay I love changing the
[02:30:05] time what do we do the whole situation
[02:30:08] is so
[02:30:10] confusing is the m outfit comfy no not
[02:30:13] at all impossible things don't it's
[02:30:15] tight so to the one way or another I'm
[02:30:18] tall but I'm not like even if everyone
[02:30:21] else suspects I'm relatively small like
[02:30:24] like in terms of like like I'm huge I'm
[02:30:26] [ __ ] massive but like because I'm so
[02:30:28] tall I have to buy the size for tall
[02:30:30] people but it also assumes I'm like
[02:30:32] larger than I am so like for example I
[02:30:35] kind of have to go in a middle ground
[02:30:37] where it's like the the thing that's
[02:30:38] supposed to go to my waist is like here
[02:30:40] it's like mid like abdominal whereas
[02:30:43] it's supposed to be like here so it's
[02:30:44] like higher because I'm taller but but
[02:30:46] but but and then here it's like tight
[02:30:49] and then my legs are cold but is what it
[02:30:52] is all right Navia doesn't think it's
[02:30:54] linear L either are we're supporting
[02:30:56] them besides I doubt finina understands
[02:30:58] any more about what happened than we do
[02:31:00] dude why are you so mean to finina she's
[02:31:02] a [ __ ] Aron man well we'll be going
[02:31:07] then best of luck to
[02:31:15] you
[02:31:18] she's pepega true she is mar
[02:31:23] P all right what's up finally you're
[02:31:26] back well how did your investigation go
[02:31:29] uh you're guilty honest you might be
[02:31:32] disappointed he it's looking R for you
[02:31:34] we're already very grateful that you
[02:31:35] were willing to help well now don't you
[02:31:38] all look
[02:31:40] disappointed don't tell me that your
[02:31:42] investigation came up
[02:31:45] empty-handed not what to be expected of
[02:31:47] course the guilty can never produce
[02:31:50] proof of their
[02:31:51] innocence D but don't let that stop you
[02:31:55] I shall be terribly disappointed should
[02:31:58] you my most anticipated foe concede so
[02:32:02] easily since both parties are present I
[02:32:05] declare that the trial regarding the
[02:32:07] magic inent look at his chest session
[02:32:10] firstly in order for the audience to
[02:32:12] understand the causes and results of the
[02:32:14] incident could we please have Mr lny
[02:32:16] explain wait if finina is the archon of
[02:32:18] Justice isn't she like I will explain
[02:32:21] while Lynette demonstrates on stage okay
[02:32:23] not to sound like the cringe people on
[02:32:25] [ __ ] Twitter but if Fin's the archon
[02:32:27] of Justice wouldn't she be like you're
[02:32:29] innocent until we prove otherwise why is
[02:32:31] she like accusing
[02:32:36] people thank you Mr Linny in that case I
[02:32:39] take your statement to be that you ran
[02:32:42] to and remained hidden within the magic
[02:32:45] the drama
[02:32:46] the trick began and thus could not have
[02:32:49] committed the crime is this correct yes
[02:32:52] that's correct your honor okay in that
[02:32:54] case I call upon the prosecution lady
[02:32:58] finina do you wish to refute his
[02:33:00] statement in any way why of course I do
[02:33:04] why is she so close to the camera to
[02:33:06] take the first shot and break this case
[02:33:08] wide open Mr Lenny is clearly lying okay
[02:33:14] bold words I like the pose though I do
[02:33:16] like the pose there is no way you could
[02:33:18] have been in the Box the whole time if
[02:33:20] you were to abduct Hy and murder cowl in
[02:33:24] fact I'd say you hardly that those are
[02:33:28] some sentences she just said hey okay
[02:33:32] okay simply your hypothesis based on the
[02:33:34] presumption that I'm guilty okay oh is
[02:33:38] that so and thatl Screen transition what
[02:33:41] did you hear while you were inside your
[02:33:45] box good question The Roaring countdown
[02:33:47] of the crowd of course answer that's how
[02:33:49] I kept track of the time and built
[02:33:51] anticipation for the finale and you
[02:33:54] didn't hear anything else at all nothing
[02:33:57] that might leave an impression of any
[02:34:00] kind no
[02:34:02] nothing what about the bang but when the
[02:34:05] count reached 30 seconds or so there was
[02:34:07] a thud one so loud that I believe
[02:34:11] practically everyone you fell from my
[02:34:13] trap huh why need the sound effect H
[02:34:16] whatever I W find it in time all good
[02:34:17] hey hang on something's not right
[02:34:22] here yeah Lenny how can you not know
[02:34:24] about the sound yeah I'm sure he could
[02:34:26] have heard a noise that loud from inside
[02:34:28] the box I was right by the box and I
[02:34:31] definitely heard the thud dude no one
[02:34:34] asked you suspicious audience member you
[02:34:35] don't even have a [ __ ] name that's
[02:34:37] how irrelevant you
[02:34:38] are look at those scales could those
[02:34:43] mean well then ladies and gentlemen
[02:34:48] allow me to use the words of the
[02:34:50] magician himself you never know what can
[02:34:53] happen in the blink of an eye indeed it
[02:34:57] seems as Alibi can also collapse I was
[02:35:01] underground I promise sorry of course I
[02:35:05] have armed myself to do far more than
[02:35:07] smash your Alibi confidence cannot go
[02:35:11] unfounded and my foundations are Rock
[02:35:15] Solid okayy aren't you and Lynette
[02:35:18] actually from the house of the
[02:35:21] heart what is this zoom in the house of
[02:35:23] the
[02:35:25] heart oh yeah they are foui ah see we
[02:35:28] knew
[02:35:30] it no wonder they did something like
[02:35:33] this so the serial disappearances were
[02:35:36] the fatou is doing now it all makes
[02:35:38] sense I've got a feeling that what
[02:35:40] happened on stage probably wasn't just
[02:35:42] an
[02:35:44] accident
[02:35:46] that's irrelevant our identities have
[02:35:49] nothing to do with what
[02:35:51] happened true but also minus two fou
[02:35:54] doesn't sound that bad but you're right
[02:35:56] it doesn't have anything to do with this
[02:35:57] case indeed true and perhaps you could
[02:36:00] tell us everything that happened during
[02:36:02] that one minute yeah your first priority
[02:36:05] is to prove yourself innocent after all
[02:36:08] I'm sure there is little that needs to
[02:36:10] be kept secret now unless your script
[02:36:13] already has holes in it
[02:36:21] is speechless
[02:36:23] my the [ __ ] is
[02:36:27] this now comes the ining in Discord
[02:36:30] Discord yeah Fin's going to call me on
[02:36:32] Discord we're we're close like
[02:36:35] that good thing I made all those
[02:36:38] preparations seems the all nighter I
[02:36:40] pled last night is really all
[02:36:44] righty L she's just goofy why didn't you
[02:36:47] tell us this before she's just
[02:36:50] goofy Lenny and Lynette are fatou DOT
[02:36:52] dude we're literally best friends with
[02:36:54] child and wander I guess wander kind of
[02:36:56] got debated by Dori but doesn't matter
[02:36:58] we're L we're literally oomies with
[02:37:01] child order
[02:37:04] order Mr Linny allow me to reestablish
[02:37:07] the facts lady finina has raised two
[02:37:09] points first when the thud was heard in
[02:37:12] the Opera House you were neither in the
[02:37:14] box nor the tunnel true thank you net
[02:37:16] you and Miss Lynette are both members of
[02:37:18] the House of the Hearth I feel like
[02:37:20] finina just says whatever's on her goofy
[02:37:22] mind and then nette actually like makes
[02:37:23] sense Net's just like the he's just like
[02:37:26] he's just like a yeah she's kind of
[02:37:28] she's kind of out of her mind but you
[02:37:30] know we like her that's net are these
[02:37:33] claims
[02:37:34] true that's
[02:37:36] like it's not me chat nette is
[02:37:42] Oz I'm finina and net is a Jeff
[02:37:47] there's no doubt about a magician's
[02:37:48] ability to con others given how Len has
[02:37:50] conceal his identity this could all have
[02:37:51] been set up
[02:37:54] beforehand plus child is here in Fontana
[02:37:57] that's actually true and [ __ ] Lenny
[02:37:59] was like daddy's coming home to [ __ ]
[02:38:01] n his little brother whatever his
[02:38:03] [ __ ] name is which might be arino
[02:38:05] just
[02:38:08] saying please answer my question Mr
[02:38:11] Linny I'm
[02:38:14] sorry yes they're true your
[02:38:18] honor
[02:38:21] okay okay I was looking I knew it you
[02:38:25] didn't know anything man well that's it
[02:38:27] we might as well move on to the
[02:38:28] sentencing already this is literally
[02:38:30] twitch chat this is literally twitch
[02:38:31] chat they're like oh we knew it and then
[02:38:34] they know nothing freak you
[02:38:36] chat my defense cannot proceed in that
[02:38:39] case what is your request I request a be
[02:38:42] brief adjournment is that really
[02:38:44] necessary they're already as good as
[02:38:46] guilty the defendant deceived their own
[02:38:48] attorney you guys are acting like it's
[02:38:50] not you but you know for a fact if you
[02:38:52] guys were in the audience and finina was
[02:38:53] talking you'd be like so true finina and
[02:38:55] then they Len would die order order I
[02:39:01] say your request is reasonable and we
[02:39:04] shall adjourn this trial will reconvene
[02:39:07] in 1 hour maybe not all of you but like
[02:39:09] 60 70% 80 so you would stick to Mr
[02:39:13] Lenny's defense even after knowing what
[02:39:15] you do now you certainly have more
[02:39:18] professionalism than I thought in that
[02:39:21] case my dear I really like her outfit
[02:39:24] let's allow the joy of victory for a
[02:39:27] little while
[02:39:30] longer also like her
[02:39:33] laugh toothpaste hair true she does look
[02:39:36] like [ __ ] Crest
[02:39:38] toothpaste nine out of 10
[02:39:41] dentists finina is the 10th dentist we
[02:39:44] found we found the one that disagrees
[02:39:46] well this is awkward I didn't think the
[02:39:50] hydro archon would dig all that up I'm
[02:39:53] sorry
[02:39:54] yeah Pon doesn't know where to start we
[02:39:58] trusted you two we based our entire
[02:40:00] reasoning on the assumption that you
[02:40:02] weren't bad
[02:40:04] guys not to set the wrong tone or
[02:40:07] anything but I'm very
[02:40:09] sorry I know you're angry and reasonably
[02:40:12] so but please let me explain
[02:40:16] I know you've clashed with a vouille
[02:40:17] several times before I wouldn't be
[02:40:20] surprised if just hearing the words is
[02:40:22] enough to make you upset I can't wait
[02:40:23] for the story of
[02:40:25] dude look I know Linny is probably like
[02:40:29] he's like a kid kind of but it's
[02:40:31] probably AR you know like pulling
[02:40:32] strings and [ __ ] but I love how gjon has
[02:40:34] to do this thing where it's like oh no
[02:40:36] the playable character isn't actually
[02:40:37] evil here's why and then they just
[02:40:39] explain it oh okay child's cool oh
[02:40:41] wander he's he's a good guy and then
[02:40:43] okay but surely we can play evil
[02:40:45] character
[02:40:46] cuz I know for a fact theor is not
[02:40:48] getting a Redemption AR he [ __ ]
[02:40:49] better not but we I still want to play
[02:40:50] him I want him to die but I want to play
[02:40:53] him but our organization is very very
[02:40:55] large and the harbingers have very
[02:40:57] different personalities and goals right
[02:41:00] now we want to save people as many as we
[02:41:03] traveler isn't Friends a child dude we
[02:41:05] were like dude we were like Against
[02:41:06] Child and then he rised us up he showed

[02:41:14] right I love you child that's how it
[02:41:16] went that's right I'm sure we're on the
[02:41:19] same now we have his vision he has too
[02:41:20] much R the disaster that its people
[02:41:22] might
[02:41:25] face I knew if it weren't for our
[02:41:27] respective identities we could become
[02:41:29] good
[02:41:32] friends that's why I didn't wish to flat
[02:41:34] out lie to you but chose to hide some
[02:41:36] details instead the truth is very
[02:41:39] important but being completely
[02:41:41] transparent about everything would see
[02:41:42] us spending more effort than we need to
[02:41:55] right so you be the judge Heck if I were
[02:41:59] you I fear that I'd even struggle to
[02:42:01] trust me at this
[02:42:03] point yeah well okay traveler is kind of
[02:42:06] like kind of like doesn't trust child
[02:42:07] and it's kind of like neutral face but
[02:42:09] then every time child shows up he's like
[02:42:10] oh hey bestie and then I feel like deep
[02:42:12] down inside the mean like child or or
[02:42:14] Aether whoever the [ __ ] it doesn't
[02:42:15] matter I'm saying like I feel like TR
[02:42:16] like like they like won't admit it but
[02:42:17] like they're homies they just won't
[02:42:19] admit it I don't know I don't know I
[02:42:21] don't know I don't know I'm just saying
[02:42:23] cuz eventually we know this in patch
[02:42:25] like 5.8 or 6.4 or 7.1 trial's going to
[02:42:29] be like going to sacrifice himself to
[02:42:31] save us and then we're going to be like
[02:42:32] oh my God tartaglia and then he's going
[02:42:34] to die but it's going to be like a
[02:42:35] villain Redemption Arc where he's like
[02:42:37] an like he's like not a good guy but not
[02:42:39] a bad guy and he kind of like saved us
[02:42:41] true you met a Fus who works as a
[02:42:44] magician uh
[02:42:46] by trade all by coincidence
[02:42:49] too but still I'm asking you to trust me
[02:42:53] I am no criminal all I'll take your word
[02:42:54] for it I trust you sorry please forgive
[02:42:57] us all right I forgive you well you both
[02:42:59] say that but explain the other issue
[02:43:02] right let's hear your answer first and
[02:43:04] of course I'll answer any question you
[02:43:06] ask I didn't ask you just [ __ ] say
[02:43:08] everything bro you mean find out the
[02:43:11] operates we want to know why it has
[02:43:14] Consciousness why it delivers sentences
[02:43:16] accurately during our investigations we
[02:43:19] learned that the machine's core is
[02:43:20] beneath it from that moment on Lynette
[02:43:23] and I have been designing this box swap
[02:43:25] trick with the objective of getting
[02:43:27] close to the
[02:43:28] core is that why you needed a whole
[02:43:31] minute that's right in truth the
[02:43:34] audience would take about 75 seconds to
[02:43:37] count down from 60 while I would only
[02:43:39] need 15 to get to the opposite box so
[02:43:42] after jumping into the tunnel I accessed
[02:43:44] the oper house basement via the vent and
[02:43:47] went to investigate the room in which
[02:43:48] the core is stored that air vent was
[02:43:51] created during the construction of the
[02:43:53] tunnel specifically to execute the step
[02:43:55] well nothing as soon as I reached that
[02:43:59] room and was about to investigate I
[02:44:00] heard someone's voice vashi what should
[02:44:03] have been impossible of course I was
[02:44:06] quite certain that I was the only one in
[02:44:07] the room he vented boy seemed to
[02:44:09] recognize me and tried to speak to me I
[02:44:12] chose to air on the side of caution and
[02:44:14] wait that's how you
[02:44:16] air okay I did not know I thought ER was
[02:44:20] like energy regeneration raate or
[02:44:21] whatever almost finished so there wasn't
[02:44:23] time to give it any
[02:44:26] thought after that the homicide occurred
[02:44:29] just as you saw well that explains why
[02:44:31] you didn't hear the thud but why do you
[02:44:34] want to understand how the orat operates
[02:44:36] because of that prophecy I told you
[02:44:38] about of course we must know all we can
[02:44:41] about this nation's secrets in order to
[02:44:43] deal with that prophesized crisis that's
[02:44:45] the only way we can save everyone so
[02:44:48] there you have it the whole truth I
[02:44:51] swear I didn't hide anything from you
[02:44:53] this time it was never my wish to
[02:44:55] proceed Under This Cloud of mistrust
[02:44:57] either but like I said earlier you can
[02:45:00] be the judge if you want to leave
[02:45:02] because you don't trust the fouille
[02:45:04] there's nothing I can do to stop you
[02:45:06] well traveler you decide P will follow
[02:45:10] your lead however you choose I believe
[02:45:13] in the
[02:45:14] facts
[02:45:15] I will defend you from these charges
[02:45:17] okay thank you thanks for giving us a
[02:45:19] the current problem is that the scales
[02:45:21] are tipped pretty badly against you if
[02:45:23] we want to refute the hydro archon's
[02:45:25] accusations we're going to need a
[02:45:27] seriously watertight defense we already
[02:45:29] have the key we need the adjournment is
[02:45:32] almost over let's go back Len claims
[02:45:34] that he headed to the chamber containing
[02:45:36] the AR core upon entering the tunnel and
[02:45:39] did not witness the witness the crime
[02:45:41] taking
[02:45:43] place and then here the the
[02:45:46] thud mysterious
[02:45:48] voice okay interesting interesting
[02:45:52] interesting interesting why did I get a
[02:45:53] new mail interesting
[02:46:00] interesting
[02:46:05] interesting the brief adjournment
[02:46:09] ends both parties have returned to their
[02:46:11] positions let us continue the trial okay
[02:46:15] when last we left off Mr Linny
[02:46:17] acknowledged the New Evidence presented
[02:46:18] by Lady finina as fact therefore lady
[02:46:21] finina may continue stating her
[02:46:23] reconstruction of the events
[02:46:27] okay that took long enough now then if
[02:46:31] everyone would lend me their
[02:46:33] attention at this oh one of her gloves
[02:46:35] is white one of them is black I or like
[02:46:37] blue I didn't know they're different
[02:46:38] colors
[02:46:42] persective based on the opposition's
[02:46:44] account of events you can identify
[02:46:46] loopholes wait okay this is
[02:46:48] literally use evidence and clues and
[02:46:50] refute any ironist asserts of
[02:46:54] facts
[02:47:05] dude it's a
[02:47:07] [ __ ] wait what's the song called
[02:47:13] uh
[02:47:17] I think I got it when you finally refute
[02:47:20] all incorrect content you can complete
[02:47:22] the cycle of
[02:47:26] reputation as the countdown began he
[02:47:29] entered the
[02:47:32] tunnel
[02:47:34] okay when the flatbed trolley passed he
[02:47:37] opened the box and got into an
[02:47:39] altercation with Hy which caused the
[02:47:42] loud
[02:47:43] thud no but okay he did not realize that
[02:47:47] this sound could be heard by everyone in
[02:47:49] the opera house which is why he claimed
[02:47:52] earlier that he could not hear the sound
[02:47:55] finally he used the vas to knock her out
[02:47:58] before making her change clothes to
[02:48:00] prevent others from recognizing her at
[02:48:03] this time cowl arrived in the having
[02:48:06] heard that noise and this is going to be
[02:48:09] fast lny
[02:48:12] red-handed so Lenny proceeded to to
[02:48:15] knock him out too before stuffing true
[02:48:17] finina true he's guilty after Lenny
[02:48:20] passed the unconscious
[02:48:22] Hy through the magic box the audience
[02:48:25] stands before operating the device is
[02:48:28] such that cow's death would be ruled in
[02:48:32] accident and there you have it that's
[02:48:36] the truth behind what happened does the
[02:48:39] defendant side have any objections to
[02:48:41] Lady fina's description the key to
[02:48:43] refuting lady finina is is the order of
[02:48:45] events oh L's talking L experienced and
[02:48:48] what he
[02:48:49] saw no that's
[02:49:00] wrong oh do I choose a [ __ ] truth
[02:49:03] bullet to review with okay so L claims
[02:49:06] uh did not wi the C
[02:49:10] yes
[02:49:11] no
[02:49:13] no no no yes so it's
[02:49:17] [Music]
[02:49:18] this is it this during the performance
[02:49:21] there's an a
[02:49:22] Thum oh Lenny entered okay that was for
[02:49:25] this one that was for this one what I
[02:49:26] meant to what I meant to use was for
[02:49:28] this one I didn't mean it for this one
[02:49:30] for this one it's easy so he didn't
[02:49:31] enter the tunnel because uh uh uh uh uh
[02:49:35] uh uh uh uh
[02:49:39] uh no it can't be
[02:49:43] that [ __ ] it we we'll this one so we use
[02:49:47] this
[02:49:48] here I am so
[02:49:51] intellect ENT the
[02:49:53] tunnel he couldn't have had that's what
[02:49:55] I meant to do that's literally what I
[02:49:56] meant to do no copium okay uh do I have
[02:50:00] to ref all of them let's do this one
[02:50:01] Lenny kidnapped howy uh well he wasn't
[02:50:04] in the [ __ ] tunnel I told you I
[02:50:06] [ __ ] told
[02:50:07] you well do I have to refute it if I
[02:50:09] just refuted this one cuz the same thing
[02:50:10] he's not the I just told you why he's
[02:50:12] not in the
[02:50:13] tunnel oh uh when Lenny returned to the
[02:50:15] tunnel the crime had already taken place
[02:50:17] and all that Linny saw was the clothes
[02:50:22] lny did not take part in the underground
[02:50:24] altercation let him cook where's the
[02:50:28] music no the song's no it's not the
[02:50:30] right
[02:50:31] one that's the same
[02:50:41] one a meticulous design mag activated
[02:50:51] wait
[02:50:56] what do I have to refute all of them I
[02:50:58] feel like I feel like this can't happen
[02:51:01] if this happen and then this I guess
[02:51:03] it's this
[02:51:06] one wait what is this a meticulous
[02:51:08] design uh claims I've
[02:51:13] heard [ __ ] it
[02:51:15] I I'm sorry I'm sorry okay Enter the
[02:51:19] tunnel
[02:51:29] um dude I refuted the two ones that
[02:51:34] matter this doesn't say anything wait
[02:51:36] let me read it again this water
[02:51:40] [Music]
[02:51:43] prank
[02:51:44] [Music]
[02:51:51] oh you have to do all of all okay I
[02:51:54] see Lenny claims that he headed into the
[02:51:57] chamber chamber you want to play Let's
[02:52:00] Play containing the core upon entering
[02:52:03] the tunnel and did not witness the crime
[02:52:06] thus he didn't hear the thud which is
[02:52:08] something that we could
[02:52:13] use
[02:52:17] [ __ ] it yo to the uh-huh so okay cool
[02:52:23] yeah you don't have to do all of them
[02:52:24] that's what I thought okay
[02:52:26] cool cuz I was like how the [ __ ] would
[02:52:28] you do all of them that makes sense
[02:52:31] easy when the countdown started Linny
[02:52:34] did indeed go into the tunnel true but
[02:52:37] he immediately used a vent to access the
[02:52:40] opera house basement which is where the
[02:52:43] underground of the orri story once he
[02:52:47] reached that area he heard a voice in
[02:52:49] what should have been an empty room but
[02:52:52] it wasn't he felt something was a Miss
[02:52:55] he returned
[02:52:57] immediately the crime
[02:53:01] scene of other people it's okay wor he
[02:53:05] did not remain there for any L bro aditt
[02:53:08] it he
[02:53:09] vented
[02:53:11] finally and that was when the accident
[02:53:14] happened from his point of view
[02:53:22] y successful
[02:53:25] refutation wait
[02:53:27] refutation
[02:53:29] refutation what the [ __ ] is a refu
[02:53:41] tation p I did it P is that how you
[02:53:45] spell it
[02:53:47] that wasn't it awesome in other words oh
[02:53:53] tation I'm listen I'm tired listen it's
[02:53:57] tation like ta and then TI is like a I
[02:53:59] get it shut the [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up
[02:54:02] I am I was I
[02:54:04] was that's
[02:54:06] right that's
[02:54:10] right my reasoning no Fino your
[02:54:14] reasoning not flawed I don't mean to say
[02:54:15] it like that it's just that the on stage
[02:54:16] equipment was clearly tampered with but
[02:54:19] you say cowl bumped into Lenny if that's
[02:54:21] the case then if cow hadn't entered the
[02:54:23] tunnel who was the entire setup meant to
[02:54:27] kill assuming that what you say is true
[02:54:30] wa Chad how long did you guys say act
[02:54:31] one would take to kidnap the young girl
[02:54:33] to cause a new disappearance case what
[02:54:37] would the point of killing someone on
[02:54:39] Stage B oh three to four go
[02:54:42] Point that's you tell them and that's
[02:54:46] why they're partners of mine true me and
[02:54:48] Navia we go way back turn things around
[02:54:51] I was at her concert on her first tour
[02:54:53] your denial is very strident I'll give
[02:54:56] you that but what proof do you have to
[02:54:59] back your
[02:55:01] claims uh do you happen to remember how
[02:55:03] you refuted Lenny's initial alivi of
[02:55:07] course I do if he had been in the magic
[02:55:10] box the whole time how could he have not
[02:55:13] heard that sound why do you
[02:55:16] ask you're saying that he
[02:55:20] wasn't your claim has now become my
[02:55:23] weapon your claim has also become a
[02:55:25] critical
[02:55:30] clue what choose wait uh evidence okay
[02:55:36] what
[02:55:38] irrelevance okay so we have to choose
[02:55:41] what makes sense wait was I reading okay
[02:55:43] I'm just going to pretend I read okay so
[02:55:45] she said okay how is the missing person
[02:55:48] during the pman there's an audible thump
[02:55:50] no one left oh this is
[02:56:01] okay I think it's that no one left but
[02:56:03] wait what the [ __ ] what did we say again
[02:56:05] wait so she refuted linny's thing when
[02:56:08] he said that he went in the Box no that
[02:56:10] he wasn't or whatever the [ __ ] she was
[02:56:12] like yeah you entered the box and then
[02:56:14] you must have heard it but then he was
[02:56:15] like no I wasn't which
[02:56:20] means is it just this yeah no one gives
[02:56:23] a [ __ ] about it has to be unless it's no
[02:56:25] it's this that's right Lenny wasn't Bo
[02:56:30] that's right this means that when the
[02:56:33] crime Happ was in the vent had already
[02:56:35] entered the basement via the vent true
[02:56:39] the same clue you used to disprove his
[02:56:41] Alibi dude I wasn't the Imposter I was
[02:56:43] in the vent I didn't kill it dude I
[02:56:44] didn't kill that I I was I was in the
[02:56:48] vent well played thanks na to think
[02:56:51] you'd use such
[02:56:54] logic well then if it wasn't Linny who
[02:56:58] committed the crimes then who
[02:57:02] wasn't the murder
[02:57:06] [Music]
[02:57:09] was logic
[02:57:13] chain
[02:57:15] the guards investigation reported
[02:57:16] against the fireworks near the end of
[02:57:18] the show indicated ignited ignite like
[02:57:21] League of Legend and burn through the
[02:57:23] ropes suspending the water tank above
[02:57:25] the stage this caused the water tank to
[02:57:27] fall and kill cowl in the box
[02:57:34] below if Lenny is no longer Under
[02:57:36] Suspicion only the other members of The
[02:57:37] Troop would be able to Tamper the props
[02:57:40] okay no spoilers for this chat I got
[02:57:41] this
[02:57:43] like
[02:57:46] supposed to work by using a box out of
[02:57:48] the box and then lyny changes with him
[02:57:51] Lenny
[02:57:52] yep the clothes belong to Housey they
[02:57:55] went missing okay select any clue wait
[02:57:58] who is the person who could have
[02:58:00] committed the
[02:58:04] crime let me see what they say isow
[02:58:07] Lenny's assistant okay I'm not going to
[02:58:09] look at chat for a bit been able to
[02:58:10] tamper with the equipment well actually
[02:58:12] let me okay I close chat
[02:58:14] py is the missing person and an ordinary
[02:58:17] audience
[02:58:18] member or did she have her own sche all
[02:58:23] along could there have been a third
[02:58:25] person
[02:58:26] involved is that really a
[02:58:31] possibility okay my heart was like yo
[02:58:34] there's a third but there can't be cuz
[02:58:35] the little girl at the front was like no
[02:58:37] no I came in so it can't be that it's
[02:58:38] dumb to click it because of what we know
[02:58:40] in game they don't want us to click this
[02:58:41] I saw well I was like what if it's just
[02:58:43] but it's not that so it's one of these
[02:58:45] two realistically do we know this guy's
[02:58:47] dead we didn't see his body did we I
[02:58:49] feel like if he was dead we'd [ __ ]
[02:58:50] know they're just like oh the go will
[02:58:52] died but like how the [ __ ] do we know
[02:58:53] de's name is cow's
[02:58:56] assistant is a missing and an ordinary
[02:58:59] audience
[02:59:01] member or did she have her
[02:59:11] own the deceased's name is cow okay
[02:59:14] where the [ __ ] is his
[02:59:16] body ah I knew it let me punch out
[02:59:21] again I'm too good dude we would have
[02:59:23] seen his [ __ ]
[02:59:24] body we would have seen his [ __ ] body
[02:59:27] every [ __ ] dong and roma execution
[02:59:29] you see their
[02:59:33] body we did that can't be right he died
[02:59:36] serious yeah it was probably a [ __ ]
[02:59:38] fake body oh maybe he did die okay maybe
[02:59:40] he did die maybe he did die maybe he
[02:59:41] died but then he was being used okay but
[02:59:44] it couldn't have been the [ __ ] girl
[02:59:45] anyways doesn't matter there's literally
[02:59:47] a 50/50 and then there's no way as a
[02:59:49] girl oh yeah serial killer kidnaps women
[02:59:52] and it's her who kidnapped herself okay
[02:59:56] let's say it's her let's say it was her
[02:59:57] what would have been the point of the
[02:59:58] [ __ ] crime to kill a random dude
[03:00:03] wow is that so how
[03:00:07] interesting let's hear your reasoning
[03:00:10] then what I must do next is recreate the
[03:00:12] truth what cow did and how he we lit
[03:00:16] have to make a [ __ ] comic
[03:00:20] book what the
[03:00:23] [ __ ] okay um Let Me Close chat
[03:00:27] again
[03:00:29] okay how can we envisage Lenny as having
[03:00:33] been unable to interfere with the crime
[03:00:35] okay so we'll start with Lenny Lenny was
[03:00:37] not in the tunnel at that moment which
[03:00:40] gave our criminal ample
[03:00:42] time
[03:00:45] the sound we heard may have come from a
[03:00:47] CL what let me let me I wanted to hear
[03:00:50] that again is in the
[03:00:52] tunnel so there must have been some fear
[03:00:55] that she would attract
[03:00:57] attention the deceased's name is cowl
[03:01:00] Len's
[03:01:01] assistant he would have been able to
[03:01:03] tamper with the
[03:01:04] equipment no one entered or left the
[03:01:07] Opera House through its
[03:01:09] entrances so where would the criminal
[03:01:12] have wanted to take
[03:01:15] it was Shang Ling she cooked her and
[03:01:17] then they
[03:01:18] ate she was turning into food no one
[03:01:20] could tell she was gone Shang Ling was
[03:01:22] actually the murderer the whole
[03:01:23] time sorry um no one entered or
[03:01:27] left
[03:01:30] okay it would have been tough for both
[03:01:33] people to fit into that vent they would
[03:01:36] likely have bumped into line as
[03:01:39] well Lenny was not in the tunnel at that
[03:01:42] moment which gave our criminal ample
[03:01:46] time the deceased's name is cowl
[03:01:50] Len's PA's clothing was in the
[03:01:53] tunnel so there must have been some fear
[03:01:56] that she would attract attention I don't
[03:01:58] get what the so there must have been
[03:01:59] some fear that would attract attention
[03:02:01] means the sound we heard may have come
[03:02:03] from a clash between the missing Hy and
[03:02:05] the
[03:02:08] criminal okay so that's the thud that
[03:02:10] probably goes there like second and then
[03:02:11] it's like like two three and then four
[03:02:14] is one of them and then five is the
[03:02:15] other one of
[03:02:16] them it would have been tough for both
[03:02:19] people to fit into that
[03:02:20] vent Lenny was not in the tunnel at that
[03:02:24] [ __ ]
[03:02:25] it okay's clo was in the tunnel does
[03:02:29] that mean that's right so there must
[03:02:31] have been some fear that she would
[03:02:33] attract the sound we heard may have come
[03:02:35] from a clash between the missing third I
[03:02:38] guess and then second would be
[03:02:40] like the de name is
[03:02:44] uh I'm not sure the order I guess the is
[03:02:47] that a grief it might be this one it
[03:02:49] have been for people to fit into that
[03:02:51] vent
[03:02:53] Shorty's [ __ ]
[03:02:56] it oh the question changed I didn't even
[03:02:58] notice clothing oh wait I'm right oh I'm
[03:03:01] so good okay who's the Prime Suspect
[03:03:04] this guy the deceased name is cow where
[03:03:07] did the missing Housey go uh she can't
[03:03:09] go in the vent she can't go out here so
[03:03:10] it's whatever this is we heard may have
[03:03:12] come from a Clash between the missing
[03:03:14] and the
[03:03:16] criminal it would have been tough for
[03:03:18] both people to fit into that vent they
[03:03:21] would like I mean she could also went
[03:03:22] into the vent after Linny left is that a
[03:03:24] dumb take What if after Linny left the
[03:03:26] vent they [ __ ] chucked her in the
[03:03:28] vent you probably could have done that
[03:03:30] ENT the it's not that I didn't mean to
[03:03:33] cck that the sound we heard may have
[03:03:35] come from a clash between the missing
[03:03:37] and the
[03:03:39] criminal I mean I guess this proves
[03:03:40] where she is but I feel like she Chuck
[03:03:42] they chucked her into he chucked her
[03:03:43] into a
[03:03:45] vent [ __ ] I knew okay okay I knew it I
[03:03:47] knew it wait the last one they literally
[03:03:49] chucked her into a vent it would have
[03:03:50] been tough for it's literally in the
[03:03:51] vent they chuck her in a
[03:03:54] vent wait no wrong one been for both
[03:03:58] people
[03:04:00] clothing and then this one's the vent
[03:04:02] would have been tough for both people to
[03:04:04] fit no no no it's the sound heard may
[03:04:06] have come from a clash yeah that goes
[03:04:10] there what it was the okay but I knew it
[03:04:13] it was the I I told you I literally told
[03:04:14] you he waited and then he trucked her in
[03:04:15] the van I
[03:04:18] knew no one enter or left okay I'm
[03:04:22] opening chat again yo okay I got most of
[03:04:24] them though I actually got most of them
[03:04:26] this is actually stupid though how okay
[03:04:29] okay okay okay okay if this this clue
[03:04:33] says hey no one left why the [ __ ] would
[03:04:35] the answer to where did howy go be no
[03:04:38] one left wow good [ __ ] answer I
[03:04:42] literally said they [ __ ] stuffed her
[03:04:43] in the vent which is probably going to
[03:04:45] be the correct answer I game baited me
[03:04:48] game baited me that wasn't my
[03:04:55] fault there's no
[03:04:59] answer so I was
[03:05:06] right I literally was
[03:05:12] right wait she's in the audience what's
[03:05:15] wrong traveler are you still having
[03:05:16] trouble figuring things
[03:05:19] out she's either in the audience or they
[03:05:21] stuffed her into a vent I think if I'm
[03:05:23] the criminal you stuff her in the vent
[03:05:25] you wait for L to leave you put her in
[03:05:26] there G what the [ __ ] is she going to do
[03:05:29] seems far from the truth look since
[03:05:33] we're at a dead end why not consider a
[03:05:36] different
[03:05:37] track just like the trick is it
[03:05:39] transpired the end result must have been
[03:05:42] bad ending what the [ __ ] are you talking
[03:05:45] about if only we knew how Hoy
[03:05:48] disappeared well that would be nice but
[03:05:50] the tunnel only has three exits and none
[03:05:52] of them seem very likely but it's not
[03:05:55] like this is a magic trick where you can
[03:05:57] just make a real life person disappear
[03:06:00] you know like you did from that one
[03:06:02] she's still here if no one left she's
[03:06:03] probably in the [ __ ]
[03:06:07] audience could it have been the water
[03:06:09] excuse my Interruption dear opponents
[03:06:12] but you not see oh yeah there is
[03:06:14] actually a lot of clues that we didn't
[03:06:16] use we didn't use the vas we didn't use
[03:06:18] the in thiser house awward delay in the
[03:06:27] performance if the defense is unable to
[03:06:29] make further effective arguments we will
[03:06:32] move on to the next stage of the trial
[03:06:33] no no I have I I can make something
[03:06:37] objection we was not in the tunnel at
[03:06:40] that moment which gave our criminal
[03:06:42] ample time
[03:06:45] the sound we heard may have come from a
[03:06:47] clash between the missing okay I
[03:06:48] literally said all this the deceased's
[03:06:50] name is I literally said all
[03:06:52] this oh oh let's just not give him the
[03:06:55] correct clue so he looks like an idiot
[03:06:57] in front of his chat and everyone makes
[03:06:58] fun of him oh now the correct clue is
[03:07:00] here and I even said we didn't use the
[03:07:01] vase and now I chose the vase oh who
[03:07:03] would have [ __ ] th it who would have
[03:07:05] [ __ ] thk it it was used to cover
[03:07:09] important evidence the
[03:07:12] water
[03:07:16] I'm
[03:07:20] pissed hon gets it it all comes together
[03:07:24] if Hy disappeared instead of being
[03:07:28] kidnapped lyette escaped from the water
[03:07:30] tank Vanishing gradually and leaving
[03:07:32] only clothes
[03:07:34] behind why does all say chat GPT lawyer
[03:07:37] what does that even mean there's a
[03:07:39] similar method where a person could be
[03:07:42] transed formed into
[03:07:46] water Mona Dash it was Mona hope you
[03:07:50] know how Preposterous you sound at the
[03:07:53] moment How could a person ever be
[03:07:56] transformed into water this is reality
[03:08:00] we're talking about here not some
[03:08:03] objection fin I would like to introduce
[03:08:04] you to Mona and
[03:08:10] aaka [ __ ] I rolled over my headset again
[03:08:13] all
[03:08:15] right I love Fino's laugh yeah it's
[03:08:17] actually pretty
[03:08:18] good sorry I request that we examine
[03:08:21] Cowell's personal effects we might find
[03:08:23] something there must we really I should
[03:08:27] think that of anyone your friend Linny
[03:08:29] already knows this truth I think okay
[03:08:31] this is bad writing I like fin but I
[03:08:34] feel like she's kind of like silly and
[03:08:35] likes being entertained by like a good
[03:08:37] trial in the sense of like she just gets
[03:08:39] off on it like the thrill so she should
[03:08:41] be like happy that that it's like the
[03:08:43] plot thickens and that it goes longer
[03:08:44] she shouldn't be like do we really have
[03:08:46] to go over it so this line should be
[03:08:48] Rewritten true magic tricks are just
[03:08:51] Illusions and
[03:08:53] misdirection but H's disappearance is
[03:08:56] very real she wants to win yeah I know
[03:08:58] but I think maybe this is just me
[03:09:00] projecting what I wish finina was I feel
[03:09:02] like she should be like the Crazy
[03:09:04] Character that's like I just want to see
[03:09:06] a cool trial but I I I guess she just
[03:09:08] has ego and wants to win so fair
[03:09:11] enough milk made no LS donated $5 diet
[03:09:17] caffeine free
[03:09:20] fiscal caffeine free Fishel she
[03:09:22] definitely has more caffeine than Fishel
[03:09:24] even so I trust the Traveler's
[03:09:28] judgment the truth must be out there
[03:09:31] somewhere perhaps some new line of
[03:09:33] reasoning may open if we try to gather
[03:09:35] all the focal points that don't make
[03:09:37] sense since Cal was the deceased we
[03:09:40] haven't placed much attention on him but
[03:09:42] given that we aren't making much
[03:09:44] progress with the case it wouldn't hurt
[03:09:45] to have a look at his belongings oh was
[03:09:47] the [ __ ] line that they drew on the
[03:09:49] ground his body am I stupid did they did
[03:09:52] they actually show it and I missed it
[03:09:53] why have I not seen his physical
[03:09:57] body is it just cuz it's like a
[03:09:58] children's game and they don't want to
[03:10:00] put they did where oh it was in the cut
[03:10:03] scene I guess I just haven't [ __ ] I
[03:10:06] don't know maybe I just wasn't looking
[03:10:07] or something I was like why didn't I see
[03:10:09] his physical [ __ ] body there they
[03:10:11] moved the body and Drew a chalk out
[03:10:14] sches when at the end of their rope the
[03:10:17] way I see it your suggestion that we
[03:10:20] broaden the scope of our investigation
[03:10:22] is nothing but a tactic for stalling the
[03:10:25] trial nevertheless I believe that this
[03:10:28] is a reasonable request on the part of
[03:10:29] an attorney since the trial does indeed
[03:10:32] appear to be at an impass I believe that
[03:10:34] additional evidence may help us make
[03:10:36] more progress guards please step into
[03:10:39] the lounge and examine the personal
[03:10:41] effects of the dis cow
[03:10:45] who spells guard like that we are still
[03:10:48] examining the items but we have already
[03:10:50] made critical progress oh [ __ ]
[03:10:53] it's we discovered several test tubes of
[03:10:58] fluid each labeled
[03:11:01] separately the notebook in his back
[03:11:03] claims that these fluids
[03:11:05] are water from the primordial sea the
[03:11:10] primordial sea the notes contents also
[03:11:13] indicate that cowl belonged to an
[03:11:14] organization that sells illegal drugs
[03:11:16] and that he had an accomplice wow the
[03:11:19] notebook has many entries concerning
[03:11:21] safe usage of these fluids in which the
[03:11:23] keyword dissolve appears many times one
[03:11:27] of these tubes was labeled Opera epices
[03:11:31] along with yesterday's date it is empty
[03:11:34] the notes also state that these
[03:11:36] dissolution properties work exclusively
[03:11:38] on people from Fontaine wait he just
[03:11:40] solved her that Hy was chosen as some
[03:11:43] sort of test subject oh it's a for two
[03:11:45] enemies like another test subject and
[03:11:47] then you kill
[03:11:49] them as such we believe that the defense
[03:11:52] is hypoth orasure yeah whatever fact
[03:11:54] supported by sufficient evidence another
[03:11:57] test subject you got to be kidding
[03:12:00] people dissolving into water could
[03:12:03] something so ridiculous actually wait a
[03:12:05] moment this reminds me of a certain
[03:12:07] prophecy but it's just a coincidence
[03:12:10] isn't it huh if people can become water
[03:12:13] does that mean that the water Tank's
[03:12:15] real use was as a means to hide water
[03:12:17] stains and if cowl was targeting that
[03:12:21] girl wait just a minute could that
[03:12:25] mean you two with me quick de moiselle
[03:12:28] wait what about your
[03:12:31] partners let's go just trust me huh
[03:12:35] order order oh
[03:12:38] my it is undeniable that further
[03:12:40] examination the deceased person personal
[03:12:42] effects has yielded some surprising
[03:12:44] results but we cannot yet ver of these
[03:12:48] Clues still let us assume that these
[03:12:51] Clues are indeed authentic albeit with
[03:12:54] the understanding that M Hy has yet to
[03:12:56] be found guards please continue
[03:12:58] examining the items along these lines y
[03:13:01] [ __ ] you whoever said this looks like
[03:13:02] Coos [ __ ] you you ruined it for me Mr
[03:13:03] Linny it appears your hypothesis is
[03:13:06] supported by the evidence so please
[03:13:08] continue speaking of course thank you
[03:13:11] your honor
[03:13:14] if we up feel some I believe that many
[03:13:17] of this case's seemingly unrelated Clues
[03:13:19] can be connected together right like the
[03:13:22] metal hook let's think about this cow's
[03:13:26] methods must have something to do with
[03:13:28] that water from the primordial sea oh
[03:13:32] primordial Jade Wing spear it's Shia
[03:13:36] who's the Prime Suspect this
[03:13:37] [ __ ] bro we know why are you
[03:13:39] asking me
[03:13:41] again what I to the cul use the timing
[03:13:44] now it seems like the hook rope was not
[03:13:46] meant for another magic trick but was
[03:13:49] instead some form of uh probably the
[03:13:53] yeah probably the [ __ ] hook right he
[03:13:54] Road Hog hooked
[03:13:58] it man I miss when OverWatch was good I
[03:14:00] was actually dud I was the best hooker
[03:14:02] like Road Hog what item did the culprit
[03:14:04] use to dissolve Haley this [ __ ] water
[03:14:06] from the Jade spear what it the cover
[03:14:08] used to hide the me
[03:14:10] mechanism uh no not Ro he didn't use
[03:14:13] rope to hide
[03:14:14] anything oh was it the hook was in the
[03:14:17] wait let me read again now it seems like
[03:14:19] the hook rope was not me for another
[03:14:21] magic trick but was instead now it seems
[03:14:24] like the hook rope was not meant the
[03:14:26] rope that strung the water maybe the
[03:14:28] Rope is here and then Hook is the other
[03:14:30] one hook for like the the hide thing
[03:14:33] wait what is this was in the magic on
[03:14:35] stage the entire time oh wait they use
[03:14:38] the water the
[03:14:41] the the water box Lynette was in the
[03:14:44] magic on stage the entire time no but
[03:14:47] where's the water one I remember there
[03:14:49] was something else within the inner
[03:14:51] layer of that
[03:14:53] box wait I'm no longer cooking
[03:15:00] anymore I am no longer cooking he used
[03:15:02] water to hide
[03:15:04] it like a vase but there's no [ __ ] V
[03:15:08] here Lynette was in the magic I remember
[03:15:12] with them I'll just use this I guess no
[03:15:15] no no I was going to change the Rope I
[03:15:16] swear I knew it I was going to put the
[03:15:18] hook I actually got it I just I thought
[03:15:19] I could I didn't I didn't think that
[03:15:20] would lock in I thought I could change I
[03:15:23] literally knew it first try I was going
[03:15:24] to go I wanted to put that there and go
[03:15:26] back to the other one and put the hook I
[03:15:27] was just testing I literally got
[03:15:29] it I got it first try I got it first
[03:15:33] try what the [ __ ] was that
[03:15:38] sound detective P's time to shine again
[03:15:42] the original plan cowl would tamper with
[03:15:45] the water tank rope and the number
[03:15:47] selector securing his Target when the
[03:15:51] magic box containing Hy was lowered the
[03:15:54] metal hook would retract gradually and
[03:15:56] Pierce the balloon at the top of the
[03:16:02] box when the balloon attached to the Box
[03:16:05] popped the water from the primordial
[03:16:07] seed inside it would pour down and
[03:16:11] dissolve Hy
[03:16:14] afterward cow would enter the tunnel and
[03:16:17] break the flower base to conceal the
[03:16:19] water inside the tunnel with the
[03:16:21] remaining evidence being covered up by
[03:16:24] the water tank on stage but he
[03:16:27] encountered something unexpected in the
[03:16:31] tunnel and wound up being fatally hit by
[03:16:34] the
[03:16:35] same he meant to use to cover his tracks
[03:16:39] huh but that actually links together a
[03:16:42] lot of them more confusing pieces of
[03:16:46] evidence how is it 50/50 after that oh
[03:16:49] dear what do I do even I think they
[03:16:52] sound convincing now have I falsely
[03:16:56] accused an innocent person I have a
[03:16:58] question fin have a
[03:17:01] question no disrespect you're great but
[03:17:03] if you're the archon of Justice right
[03:17:04] okay hear me out if you're the archon of
[03:17:05] Justice right shouldn't you care more
[03:17:07] about like justice than being correct so
[03:17:09] can't you be like that sounds convincing
[03:17:11] I'm on your true now it seems like the
[03:17:14] only point of contention remaining is
[03:17:16] the exact circumstances that led to
[03:17:18] Cal's death C deleted Halls baby girl
[03:17:23] his notes mentioned he had an accomplice
[03:17:25] who could be related to the situation
[03:17:26] it's not how lawyers work yeah
[03:17:30] but the archon of Justice shouldn't be a
[03:17:33] lawyer you should be trying to deliver
[03:17:36] Justice not trying to represent your
[03:17:37] client do you know what a lawyer does
[03:17:39] you try to give your client the fair the
[03:17:41] fairest
[03:17:42] uh uh uh like the fairest interpretation
[03:17:45] of the law type of thing is is what you
[03:17:48] want you're not trying to [ __ ] if
[03:17:49] your client comes you says I killed this
[03:17:51] person you can't just go in court and be
[03:17:53] like yeah he didn't kill
[03:17:57] anyone or like if you do this like okay
[03:18:00] whatever dude she's not okay but listen
[03:18:02] she's
[03:18:07] not shouldn't
[03:18:10] the I mean okay there's a way way to go
[03:18:12] around it like you kind of can but like
[03:18:14] you should like there's ways that it's
[03:18:16] more detailed than that but the point is
[03:18:18] if you're going to be like the the the
[03:18:19] symbol of Justice it's more net than a
[03:18:22] lawyer if you're a lawyer it's not
[03:18:25] like you're going to take your client's
[03:18:27] [ __ ] best interest in
[03:18:29] mind whatever it's fine on that note the
[03:18:32] guards have just indicating that they
[03:18:34] uncovered new evidence I shall now
[03:18:37] invite him on stage to share it with
[03:18:41] us thank you your honor we were just
[03:18:44] inspecting the luggage of the other
[03:18:45] people involved in this case and we
[03:18:48] found an identical sample of the water
[03:18:50] from the primordial sea among Lenny's
[03:18:52] personal
[03:18:53] effects what wait they forged it that
[03:18:56] can't
[03:18:58] [Music]
[03:18:59] be I see well how wonderfully comedic to
[03:19:05] have your own counter attack only to
[03:19:07] come back and wound you's insane she's
[03:19:10] actually insane clear all doubt my dear
[03:19:15] citizens my loyal audience allow me to
[03:19:19] present let me mute aling this but I do
[03:19:21] appreciate the subs thanks L CJ
[03:19:27] J what Linny did not need to take part
[03:19:31] in the dissolution of the young woman at
[03:19:33] all indeed he did leave the scene via
[03:19:36] the vent okay
[03:19:38] true having made modifications to the
[03:19:41] props before hand his accomplished cowl
[03:19:44] then caused Hy to vanish using the water
[03:19:47] from the primordial
[03:19:50] sea okay cowl did do that upon his
[03:19:53] return and cruel avarice Linny desired
[03:19:57] Soul credit and prepare to do away with
[03:20:00] his partner in I don't know about that
[03:20:03] one I don't know about Lenny you know
[03:20:06] ultimately he knocked Cowell out and the
[03:20:09] tool meant to cover the crime up look
[03:20:11] how l this guy is like [ __ ] 90 90 lb
[03:20:15] at most 90 lb he can't knock anyone out
[03:20:18] he doesn't have his pyro
[03:20:20] Vision now as much as I regret having
[03:20:24] come to such a viciously straightforward
[03:20:27] conclusion it does seem that the famed
[03:20:29] fouille is quite the cold blooded and
[03:20:32] ruthless
[03:20:36] organization am I right Mr Lenny we've
[03:20:41] used up all the evidence we collected
[03:20:43] there's no way for us to make a rebuttal
[03:20:45] here is this the end of the
[03:20:49] road imagine we just lose Quest over oh
[03:20:53] no oh we actually just imagine seems
[03:20:57] using the water as new evidence was too
[03:20:59] I think we've all seen enough now and we
[03:21:02] have ample witnesses to my Flawless
[03:21:05] reasoning I believe this is indeed the
[03:21:10] finale
[03:21:13] wait I was missing a DOT we're not done
[03:21:15] Noble chief justice should we not in
[03:21:18] your
[03:21:20] view excuse me everyone but I

[03:22:07] misdirection isn't it it often conceals
[03:22:09] the truth while presenting a fascinating
[03:22:12] illusion but once everyone believes the
[03:22:14] illusion can't magic reveal the truth to
[03:22:17] them once again

[03:24:09] why firstly my name isn't Hy it's lilan
[03:24:15] I'm originally from monat what I heard
[03:24:17] that Linn's show was going to be a real
[03:24:19] Thriller but I missed the chance to buy
[03:24:21] a ticket so I stole one wait but didn't
[03:24:25] the okay they're probably going to
[03:24:26] explain it like two sentences but didn't
[03:24:27] the dude just say the the [ __ ] the
[03:24:29] solve only works on font and blood
[03:24:30] people or whatever that's how I make a
[03:24:33] living I steal stuff maybe that's why
[03:24:35] she still here and I'd never been caught
[03:24:37] before that's why she's not dead but I
[03:24:39] was noticed at the harbor a few days ago
[03:24:41] chamber and
[03:24:42] harbor was the two valer agents what's
[03:24:46] next oh shut up that was cringe I'm
[03:24:48] sorry look familiar so you were the
[03:24:50] thief I knew it I was like that's the
[03:24:54] thief and then and then and then and
[03:24:56] then then we're like okay never mind
[03:24:57] wait I literally said it was the thief
[03:25:01] wait okay I'm actually like I dude I'm
[03:25:03] I'm like didn't even mentioned that you
[03:25:04] were pretty skilled well and I thought
[03:25:07] that would have been the end of it but
[03:25:09] then the number selector chose me
[03:25:13] he even mentioned the Fortress of meped
[03:25:16] that's a prison isn't it so you can
[03:25:18] imagine how shocked I was I thought he
[03:25:20] was on to me for sure so I played along
[03:25:23] with the show while looking for an
[03:25:25] opening to flee but then I got water
[03:25:27] poured on me for no reason and then
[03:25:28] someone jumped into the tunnel to nap me
[03:25:31] okay so she didn't she hit outside
[03:25:32] instead telling saying anything and she
[03:25:34] thieved an innocent civilian I still I
[03:25:36] still agree with my initial take [ __ ]
[03:25:39] this person take that line down so I
[03:25:41] knocked him out and stuffed him into the
[03:25:43] box okay that's pretty B though there
[03:25:45] was nowhere to run from there though so
[03:25:46] I had to never mind now I'm back to
[03:25:48] neutral on her a box containing
[03:25:49] performance costumes I slipped out after
[03:25:52] the first guard arrived at the scene and
[03:25:54] continued hiding inside the Opera
[03:25:57] House can a person even hide in
[03:26:00] there professional Thief could make it
[03:26:02] work but I swear I didn't know that the
[03:26:05] water tank would fall down really I
[03:26:07] swear that guy got [ __ ] finessed that
[03:26:10] I wouldn't have put him in the magic box

[03:26:19] it this time we need to tell the entire
[03:26:22] story from wait why surely finina
[03:26:24] doesn't disagree with us now she [ __ ]

[03:30:15] of the blue Lilian
[03:30:18] panicked she picniced her Panic only
[03:30:20] intensified after she entered the tunnel
[03:30:23] and had water poured on her head hearing
[03:30:25] the commotion cowl leapt into the tunnel
[03:30:29] only to discover that lilianne had not
[03:30:32] dissolved he did not know that lilianne
[03:30:34] was not from Fontaine but was a thief
[03:30:38] who made her way in by stealing a ticket
[03:30:42] mistakingly believing that the water
[03:30:44] from the primordial sea needed time to
[03:30:46] take effect he tried to force Lilian
[03:30:49] back into the box the two broke the
[03:30:52] flower vase during the struggle but
[03:30:54] lilianne G weakest Mon civan and putting
[03:30:58] him in the box with no way of escaping
[03:31:01] she changed her clothes and hid in the
[03:31:04] costume trunk until the performance

[03:31:25] I was chatting my
[03:31:32] bad some run an ad okay but I can't do

[03:31:45] in the Opera House these last two days
[03:31:48] she had already become desperately
[03:31:50] hungry by the time we were chatting over
[03:31:52] macarons so she swiped two of them right
[03:31:55] under our noses okay about a sneaky
[03:32:00] Thief okay about like okay that actually
[03:32:02] doesn't make sense why the F okay I mean
[03:32:05] whatever at this point all the events
[03:32:07] that happened in the tunnel have now
[03:32:09] come to light
[03:32:12] also macarons aren't even filling why
[03:32:14] okay whatever so that's the whole
[03:32:17] story

[03:32:38] not yet Ended as such I request that the
[03:32:41] prosecution not leave the room before
[03:32:44] the proceedings have
[03:32:48] concluded what are you reading my mind
[03:32:51] now

[03:32:57] arguments I admit defeat but really
[03:33:01] could you at least have left me with
[03:33:02] some dignity no if there are no
[03:33:06] objections then as the Chief
[03:33:09] Justice I shall once again repeat the
[03:33:11] full sequence of events okay thank God I
[03:33:15] got to hear him sayal disappearances
[03:33:17] cowl selected his next victim from the
[03:33:20] audience reservation list with some
[03:33:22] modifications to the selector he could
[03:33:25] ensure that the pre-selected young woman
[03:33:27] would be chosen to cover up any evidence
[03:33:30] while committing the deed cowl thought
[03:33:31] of allowing the water tank to fall which
[03:33:34] would conceal the water left behind
[03:33:36] after the young woman was dissolved he
[03:33:39] also tampered with the Rope suspending
[03:33:40] the water tank using the fireworks at
[03:33:43] the end of the performance to cause the
[03:33:44] tank to drop and hide the water marks he
[03:33:47] poured the water from the primordial sea
[03:33:50] into a balloon during the preparation of
[03:33:52] the magic box and stuck it to the Box's
[03:33:54] lid finally he passed the prepared hook
[03:33:58] on a rope through the Gap in the magic
[03:33:59] Box's door when bringing the young woman
[03:34:02] to said box when the magic trick
[03:34:04] officially began the Box containing the
[03:34:07] woman was lowered into the tunnel
[03:34:09] tightening the hook rope and bursting
[03:34:11] the balloon containing the water if all
[03:34:13] had gone to plan the young woman would
[03:34:15] be dissolved at this time however Lilian
[03:34:18] was not from Fontaine and thus fled the
[03:34:21] box with a loud
[03:34:23] noise realizing that there was trouble
[03:34:25] cowl entered the tunnel and met Lilian
[03:34:28] thinking that the waters had not yet
[03:34:29] taken effect he decided to
[03:34:32] proceed however his opponent was more
[03:34:35] capable than he thought what a [ __ ]
[03:34:37] knocked unconscious and placed into the
[03:34:40] magic box
[03:34:41] and thus became his own final victim
[03:34:44] lilianne according to her own statements
[03:34:47] then changed clothes and hid until the
[03:34:48] performance ended before hiding in other
[03:34:51] parts of the Opera
[03:34:53] House as for Linny he was in the
[03:34:56] underground structures within the opera
[03:34:57] house yeah he was in the vent he these
[03:35:00] happenings he was venting from this
[03:35:01] reconstruction of events we can conclude
[03:35:04] that Linny the accused is in fact
[03:35:07] innocent hoay Linny and Lynette
[03:35:11] amazing while there is much in Linny and
[03:35:14] lilian's conduct that should still be
[03:35:16] investigated
[03:35:17] separately this case at least can be
[03:35:20] handed over to the orrice to make the
[03:35:22] final decision
[03:35:25] she [ __ ] is that a star rail
[03:35:28] wish japar
[03:35:33] himo it's the [ __ ] star uh astral

[03:36:17] crime dare to bring before this court
[03:36:20] that's why allegedly there are some
[03:36:22] allegedly free criminals allegedly from
[03:36:24] a famous case allegedly cuz there was
[03:36:26] allegedly a glove placed allegedly
[03:36:29] despite everyone allegedly knowing

[03:36:46] just following orders we were supposed
[03:36:49] to place blame for the serial
[03:36:50] disappearances onto Linny and thus cause
[03:36:52] suspicion to fall on the fouille the
[03:36:55] higher-up said this was the best
[03:36:56] opportunity to do so and now that your
[03:36:59] plan has fallen through and the secrets
[03:37:01] of the water have been revealed what's
[03:37:02] up we just saw you earlier to set higher

[03:37:18] cause people to dissolve it can also be
[03:37:21] made into a potion which when extremely
[03:37:24] diluted can cause people to experience
[03:37:27] Unforgettable exp corrup hups like IRL

[03:39:12] thank you again for defending me to the
[03:39:14] end even after you learned that I'm a
[03:39:16] member of the
[03:39:18] foule I guess but regardless I like the
[03:39:22] opportunity [ __ ] pissed I didn't
[03:39:25] approach angry dude or ill intent I've
[03:39:29] spoken to you as myself just plain Linny
[03:39:31] this entire time okay this guy's
[03:39:33] actually the rizzler dude this is
[03:39:35] literally child too as for why I'm a Fus
[03:39:38] it's because the goals of the House of
[03:39:40] the The Hearth align with those of an
[03:39:41] orphan like me that's all that was how
[03:39:45] father who you might know wait that's
[03:39:47] who father ISR us back the Nave wait no
[03:39:50] isn't the Nave arino wait a second who
[03:39:52] the [ __ ] is the Nave is it arino yeah it
[03:39:55] is arino I should like though okay it
[03:39:58] is wait they call wait aro's
[03:40:09] father
[03:40:12] the Nave the one who controls the house
[03:40:15] of the Hearth she's your
[03:40:21] father that's right and since we're here
[03:40:25] I was means father in Russian oh I see
[03:40:27] would you mind hearing story it's about
[03:40:30] my past back when our parents first died
[03:40:33] Lynette and I were left wandering the
[03:40:35] streets to survive I took to
[03:40:38] surreptitiously observing an older
[03:40:39] Street performer dude they do not give a
[03:40:41] [ __ ] about [ __ ] F huh he never talks
[03:40:44] about him pulled off his amazing
[03:40:47] tricks
[03:40:49] okay I took my sister through several
[03:40:51] streets until we found a crowded corner
[03:40:54] and we began to perform magic tricks
[03:40:56] there to my surprise we proved to be
[03:40:59] pretty popular and we could at least
[03:41:01] stop worrying about where our next meal
[03:41:03] would come from for a time but I didn't
[03:41:06] want my sister to remain a street rat
[03:41:09] together with me forever mon W long an
[03:41:12] aristocrat came to me and claimed that
[03:41:14] he wished to take us in after watching
[03:41:15] my performances so you went from orphans
[03:41:18] to nobility just like that that was how
[03:41:21] we felt at first too as if fate was on
[03:41:25] our side and we could say goodbye to
[03:41:26] those painful days but I gradually
[03:41:30] discovered that while we were called
[03:41:31] foster children he was really after my
[03:41:34] talent for magic
[03:41:36] tricks constantly take me to all sorts
[03:41:38] of Banquets to Garner in attention which
[03:41:41] he would then use to expand his Social
[03:41:43] Circles that doesn't seem too bad either
[03:41:47] better than roaming the streets at any
[03:41:49] rate but then
[03:41:51] he it took a while for me to realize
[03:41:54] just how dark his heart really was uhoh
[03:41:57] after one particular performance at a
[03:41:59] banquet I discovered that Lynette was
[03:42:02] not on the same return vehicle as me I
[03:42:05] waited a long time after we returned
[03:42:07] home but she did not come back
[03:42:10] I went to that Noble's bedroom and asked
[03:42:12] him about her whereabouts uhoh the
[03:42:14] answer he gave me was she caught the eye
[03:42:17] of the most eminent person at the
[03:42:19] banquet so I sent her over as a gift I
[03:42:22] mean you'll be able to perform your
[03:42:24] magic regardless of who your assistant
[03:42:26] is yes and then then he killed him so he
[03:42:29] was going
[03:42:30] to but would INF fontaine's laws deal
[03:42:33] with such people as far as Outsiders are
[03:42:36] concerned this is a relationship akin to
[03:42:39] adoption or more foster care and they
[03:42:41] have their ways of escaping the eye of
[03:42:43] the
[03:42:46] law D so what happened after that I
[03:42:49] managed to faret out the location of the
[03:42:51] Mansion of that so-called eminent person
[03:42:54] and hurried through the night but by the
[03:42:56] time I leaped over the walls avoided the
[03:42:58] guards and made my way
[03:43:00] in all I saw was the Moonlight ground
[03:43:03] covered in blood and the Nave standing
[03:43:07] there in the okay this game tilts me
[03:43:10] they always there has to be okay every
[03:43:12] time it's yeah this villain did nothing
[03:43:14] wrong see now arlino is a good guy hey
[03:43:17] I'm all for it that means she's playable
[03:43:19] okay true thanks now we have AR Lino
[03:43:21] deserved deserved deserved that guy had
[03:43:25] a coming I'm sorry arino [ __ ]
[03:43:28] deserved so she'd already taken care of
[03:43:32] that guy that's right she had rescued my
[03:43:35] sister before she could come to any harm
[03:43:37] and had even discovered several girls
[03:43:40] hidden in a basement all of them
[03:43:42] orphans huh father I mean the Nave might
[03:43:47] have seen something in me and so she
[03:43:49] made me an
[03:43:52] offer The House of the Hearth welcomes
[03:43:54] you for your interests align with ours
[03:43:58] here none will ever betray you indeed
[03:44:01] betrayal shall never be permitted here
[03:44:04] wait I was also right trust her I mean I
[03:44:07] had just been betrayed by no this about
[03:44:10] me but I was also right about charlott's
[03:44:12] [ __ ] case that she was looking after
[03:44:14] being literally Linny Lynette like there
[03:44:16] were literally it was literally okay
[03:44:18] anyways that's [ __ ] though but she was
[03:44:20] also quick to destroy the noble who had
[03:44:22] taken us in at first giving us back our
[03:44:25] freedom it isn't wait aren't they
[03:44:27] looking after oh I guess it was 20 years
[03:44:30] ago okay never mind I guess it's not the
[03:44:33] same
[03:44:36] Dam oh so that's how the two of you join
[03:44:40] the house of the Hearth the Nave isn't
[03:44:42] after the neosis is wait is after the
[03:44:44] neosis isn't she she has her own plans
[03:44:49] she has gained permission from the
[03:44:50] Serita to first use theosis
[03:44:53] power R it to find a way to break the
[03:44:56] prophecy and save
[03:45:01] Fontaine no that's someone else whatever
[03:45:05] so close enough she believes in that
[03:45:07] Prophet that's right the whole house of
[03:45:09] the Hearth is currently working to
[03:45:10] combat that CR today's case has also
[03:45:12] proven that people from Fontaine can
[03:45:14] indeed dissolve into some sort of water
[03:45:17] thus further supporting the
[03:45:19] prophecy all of us house members here
[03:45:22] lady arino herself included are from Fon
[03:45:26] We Won't Give Up on defending our
[03:45:28] homeland to us orphans the only
[03:45:31] connection we have left to this world
[03:45:33] apart from our family is our homeland so
[03:45:38] from small like
[03:45:41] Distributing to huge schemes like
[03:45:43] stealing a nosis everything is aimed at
[03:45:46] dealing with that
[03:45:49] prophecy it's all right I understand the
[03:45:53] only thing I can do is relate all this
[03:45:55] to you I just hope you can understand
[03:45:57] that even as a member of the house I
[03:46:00] have never stopped making my own
[03:46:01] decisions and that I believe what I'm
[03:46:03] doing is right if you should need
[03:46:06] anything at all in the future feel free
[03:46:08] to find me
[03:46:10] I will do my best to help you as plain
[03:46:17] Linny
[03:46:22] okay um bye
[03:46:28] Linny uh I don't know how I feel about
[03:46:30] what I just learned but
[03:46:38] okay
[03:46:40] I mean base arino I
[03:46:43] guess hey there what was with the
[03:46:46] disappearing act you pulled right as the
[03:46:48] trial ended were you looking for us
[03:46:51] Navia well this whole thing isn't
[03:46:54] exactly over is it I do feel that we're
[03:46:57] getting closer to solving the serial
[03:46:59] disappearances case though huh what's
[03:47:02] wrong my dear
[03:47:06] partner besides are you sure we the ones
[03:47:09] can crack a case that's been cold for
[03:47:11] decades now and given that there's new
[03:47:15] evidence from The Trial there should be
[03:47:17] a trail of breed crumbs for the hydro
[03:47:19] archons people to follow
[03:47:22] now there one good thing immediately a
[03:47:24] good guy I mean I'm sure know still
[03:47:26] [ __ ] evil but at least she sa at
[03:47:28] least she killed that dude I'm a little
[03:47:30] that from you I can fix her maybe I
[03:47:33] don't know we'll see we'll see we'll see
[03:47:34] what happens in act to but I can
[03:47:36] probably fix her I might have been too
[03:47:38] presumptuous
[03:47:40] don't say that Navia a and we were
[03:47:43] having so much fun investigating with
[03:47:45] you
[03:47:46] too it was like having new Waters
[03:47:49] flowing into a stagnant Meer causing New
[03:47:52] Hope to Spring forth and the reflection
[03:47:54] in the Merc to become
[03:47:56] clearer sorry about that I'm a bit prone
[03:48:00] to Nostalgia don't mind me wait should
[03:48:03] we have a farewell meal you know to
[03:48:05] commemorate our time as partners huh do
[03:48:09] we really need to get that
[03:48:11] formal well guess you really did treat
[03:48:14] us as partners huh well I just like to
[03:48:17] have a proper ending anyway it would
[03:48:19] just be a meal so it's you don't have to
[03:48:21] twist oh wonderful in that case why
[03:48:24] don't we return all right then
[03:48:30] sure okay that took how the [ __ ] long
[03:48:33] did that take that took like less than 4
[03:48:36] it was like 340 3 hours 40ish 3 3 and a
[03:48:39] half cuz we started like 30 minutes more
[03:48:41] than that like 40 340 350 a bit less
[03:48:45] than four how is part two okay be honest
[03:48:47] is part two longer than part one be
[03:48:50] honest please say no okay people are
[03:48:52] saying no some are saying about the same
[03:48:54] Act is a bit shorter okay we have we
[03:48:56] have time it's only 4:30 a.m. I came
[03:48:59] here several times with my father when I
[03:49:00] was little but stopped eating here as
[03:49:03] often after growing up I hope the food
[03:49:06] here will be to your taste I love you oh
[03:49:08] don't worry we haven't eaten at a hotel
[03:49:10] like this in a
[03:49:13] while getting excited
[03:49:15] already in that case [ __ ] you p with
[03:49:18] fork please wait here okay I'll listen
[03:49:20] I'm
[03:49:25] sorry o everything looks so good people
[03:49:30] in Fontaine sure know how to enjoy life
[03:49:34] why of course go ahead try whatever you
[03:49:36] like if the food's good I'll make a
[03:49:38] group res reservation for the rest of
[03:49:40] spina D rosula next time and if it's not
[03:49:43] no it's a bagette well uh then I'll
[03:49:47] still bring everyone also why did Pon
[03:49:50] call sumu Food burnt but she's hype
[03:49:52] about Fontan food freak you Pon here
[03:49:55] have your own way of doing things oh we
[03:49:58] called this A Farewell meal but we could
[03:50:01] also treat it like a victory Feast right
[03:50:03] oh true very true in that case boss will
[03:50:08] have two dishes I like the way she
[03:50:11] thinks didn't mean that you had to order
[03:50:13] even more
[03:50:18] food speaking of cases do you think that
[03:50:21] the Mastermind behind the serial
[03:50:23] disappearances will get caught soon now
[03:50:25] that this has all happened well we've
[03:50:28] certainly taken a big step forward but I
[03:50:31] feel that's about it we know that
[03:50:33] there's an organization that means to
[03:50:35] dissolve these young women but we still
[03:50:37] don't know what they are really after if
[03:50:40] it hadn't happened right in front of us
[03:50:43] Pon wouldn't have ever believed that a
[03:50:45] person could be dissolved like
[03:50:48] that right yet it was because this was
[03:50:51] such a Preposterous notion that the
[03:50:53] investigation could never really move
[03:50:55] forward
[03:50:56] before if only that guy could have
[03:50:58] finished
[03:51:00] speaking in such investigations even the
[03:51:03] smallest step can seem like a yawning
[03:51:05] Chasm if the trail of Clues is cut off
[03:51:08] to to be honest I don't have high hopes
[03:51:11] for any followup that the authorities
[03:51:13] might conduct it's not that I don't have
[03:51:15] faith in their ability it's just that a
[03:51:18] different perspective is required in
[03:51:19] some matters it's easy to guard against
[03:51:22] and deceive a single narrow perspective
[03:51:25] a shift in thinking is required at such
[03:51:27] times in order to produce a breakthrough
[03:51:30] which is exactly why the spad dula
[03:51:32] exists those High futin folk are not all
[03:51:35] knowing that's why we exist to seep into
[03:51:38] the crack where filth falls through
[03:51:40] where their watch fails
[03:51:43] them seems Pon thought things were
[03:51:46] simpler it's all right hydrate I will
[03:51:49] hydrate this was supposed to be a
[03:51:51] farewell meal so I doubt you have
[03:51:53] further interest in this business let's
[03:51:55] talk about something else like uh what
[03:51:58] are your future plans that's true we
[03:52:01] didn't have a chance to I've heard
[03:52:04] there's okay I can't lie part one was
[03:52:06] interesting I could not give less of a
[03:52:07] [ __ ] about this I'm sorry maybe like
[03:52:10] skill issue considering that you missed
[03:52:11] your chance
[03:52:13] today wow there must be an organization
[03:52:16] that dissolves people okay we saw that
[03:52:17] in act one getting any of time wow this
[03:52:20] food is good okay well would you
[03:52:23] consider some
[03:52:24] more unique ways perhaps even methods of
[03:52:30] let's say questionable legality guess
[03:52:33] that's beina D rula's Boss For You Chu
[03:52:36] full of sketchy ideas well one way would
[03:52:40] be to infiltrate a performance troop at
[03:52:42] the Opera House only to abandon your act
[03:52:44] at the place Climax and ask to speak to
[03:52:46] her get performance I'm sure lady finina
[03:52:49] would be eager to see the ending and
[03:52:51] would agree in order to finish watching
[03:52:52] the
[03:52:54] play could you suggest something a
[03:52:56] little more practical most attentive G
[03:52:59] player it's not even like it's good
[03:53:00] buildup calm the [ __ ] down it's not it's
[03:53:02] just recapping random facts wake her up
[03:53:04] in the dead of night and demand answers
[03:53:06] don't let her go back until answers all
[03:53:09] your questions I can personally testify
[03:53:12] that this one works when I'm sleepy I'll
[03:53:14] do anything as long as I can finally get
[03:53:16] some sleep uh that might work but ah
[03:53:21] valid point I overlooked that part I was
[03:53:24] just thinking about leveraging a
[03:53:26] person's desire for
[03:53:28] sleep all right all right no more joking
[03:53:31] around huh perhaps you
[03:53:35] could oh I don't know cut the line when
[03:53:38] she's on on a break you did defeat her
[03:53:40] in court clearing citizens of hers from
[03:53:43] false
[03:53:44] accusations false accusations she had
[03:53:46] nearly upheld personally I imagine that
[03:53:49] she feels quite ashamed about the whole
[03:53:51] thing you mean that if we catch her
[03:53:54] while she's on a break she might be too
[03:53:56] embarrassed to refuse why don't we give
[03:53:58] it a try after this meal you know strike
[03:54:01] while the iron is hot and all huh Pon
[03:54:04] did you drink my font uh was this your
[03:54:07] drink
[03:54:10] no it's fine all right honestly I'm is
[03:54:14] that so if we're all finished eating

[03:56:40] cow Vash is Quebec slang for go [ __ ]
[03:56:44] yourself but I don't know what Vash is
[03:56:46] travel maybe it's like a big cow come
[03:56:49] [Music]
[03:56:57] on oh it's [ __ ]
[03:57:02] oceanid hey man V are you my dear Vash
[03:57:07] oh
[03:57:09] no wait is it like her husband someone
[03:57:12] else do you know Vash or wife do you
[03:57:15] know where my love is I'm afraid not
[03:57:19] I'm wait who am
[03:57:23] I I'm very sorry I fear I do not know my
[03:57:28] memories feel like they have been washed
[03:57:30] away like a flood so many fragments
[03:57:33] dissolved amidst the tide never be
[03:57:36] recovered s oh how much have I lost how
[03:57:40] many things that I once held dear while
[03:57:42] on land have i s you once human yes that
[03:57:47] is what I was
[03:57:49] once but now I am but the consciousness
[03:57:52] of one who has lost their
[03:57:55] four Dam didn't we kill this thing like
[03:57:58] [ __ ] how many times like a 100 that
[03:58:01] [ __ ] at least at least we can level
[03:58:03] contr I came to be like this either I
[03:58:06] only vaguely remember being covered in
[03:58:09] light blue
[03:58:10] water and then all grew
[03:58:13] dim could you one of the girls who were
[03:58:17] dissolved I also remember going to many
[03:58:20] places I loved Adventure loved exploring
[03:58:24] places of
[03:58:25] peril no matter where I went V would go
[03:58:29] with me I knew how dearly he loved me
[03:58:34] and I also loved him equally as much but
[03:58:37] now
[03:58:39] we can no longer go
[03:58:41] back the need me to find him
[03:58:44] party why do I feel like he's going to
[03:58:46] be you know what I'm not going to say it
[03:58:48] I am going to say it why do I feel like
[03:58:49] he's going to be dead as [ __ ] there is
[03:58:51] no way for us to create any new memory
[03:58:54] the thought of me gives him no sucker so
[03:58:58] let it lie forgotten beneath the waters
[03:59:00] if you meet
[03:59:02] Vash tell him not to look for me tell
[03:59:05] him to move on I believe it will be hard
[03:59:08] for only thing I still for him to forget
[03:59:11] you perhaps that is
[03:59:13] so as I was submerged in the waters
[03:59:17] losing Consciousness I saw Vater I saw
[03:59:20] Vash above the
[03:59:22] surface his eyes were filled with such
[03:59:25] sorrow what up Julie raid such longing
[03:59:28] actually no run away please I don't want
[03:59:31] to talk about today I don't want to talk
[03:59:33] about what's happening
[03:59:34] suffer
[03:59:36] indeed I had felt a great
[03:59:40] warm
[03:59:42] oh that means V was a witness to the
[03:59:44] fact that you dissolved is that what you
[03:59:46] call
[03:59:47] it dissolving sag if anything I didn't
[03:59:52] know the ocean it was chill like that
[03:59:53] dude even the ocean's voice L when you
[03:59:54] fight her she's like Who Dares disrupt
[03:59:57] these Waters or like give like you took
[03:59:59] this from us or something I don't know I
[04:00:00] felt like she was like just like
[04:00:01] chilling it was aate you're the one that
[04:00:03] wakes her up you run up to the ocean
[04:00:04] they like wake the [ __ ] up I need to
[04:00:06] kill you they're just chilling the water
[04:00:08] still
[04:00:11] surface I could also liken it to being a
[04:00:13] thirsty person who drinks water for the
[04:00:16] first time and only then sees how they
[04:00:19] have lived for so long in a world of
[04:00:21] endless want and
[04:00:24] anxiety it seems that after the body is
[04:00:26] dissolved some measure of the
[04:00:27] Consciousness Still Remains I think I
[04:00:29] hear your
[04:00:30] companion it's time for you to go I
[04:00:32] think farewell then I am glad that you

[04:02:44] explain how you managed to show up here
[04:02:47] I followed you it seemed to me that
[04:02:50] danger has followed you more closely why
[04:02:53] follow okay that's that's suspicious I
[04:02:56] believe that following someone without
[04:02:58] their knowledge is actually called
[04:02:59] stalking is it not mr's Last Wish was
[04:03:03] for me to ensure your safety and I will
[04:03:06] not betray his Trust
[04:03:09] do the same were he alive today do not
[04:03:13] speak of my
[04:03:15] father Damion your father I was not
[04:03:18] strong enough thank you for your Aid M
[04:03:21] Gand but do keep an eye out for your
[04:03:23] manner of speech I believe we all wish
[04:03:26] to avoid unnecessary emotional harm
[04:03:29] sorry I did not consider your feelings
[04:03:32] okay let me pause for a second yo real
[04:03:35] talk like just between me and you why is
[04:03:38] she built like
[04:03:40] that whatever what else do you know how
[04:03:44] did you come to the conclusion that I'd
[04:03:45] be in grave danger I doubt I know much
[04:03:48] more than you but I believe that the
[04:03:50] Mastermind behind the serial
[04:03:51] disappearances is very powerful your
[04:03:54] performance tonight will almost
[04:03:56] certainly attract their attention H I'm
[04:03:59] sure they've known about me to be honest
[04:04:02] I'm shocked it's take them this long to
[04:04:04] act against
[04:04:05] me and what about these Garder men
[04:04:08] I thought only those associated with the
[04:04:10] Misan Guardian could control them none
[04:04:13] of these Mecca have serial numbers I was
[04:04:15] sure to check a moment ago they are not
[04:04:18] the ones used by the authorities to
[04:04:19] enforce the law please just keep in mind
[04:04:24] that every character we've seen through
[04:04:26] this
[04:04:28] Quest well at least like the important
[04:04:30] ones will be playable so so start saving
[04:04:32] your Primo gems okay ignore the rerun
[04:04:34] banners unless you want them Yo you
[04:04:36] might want J leag you might want child
[04:04:38] you might want whoever else is next
[04:04:39] that's fine I'm just saying be smart
[04:04:41] with your Gems or you might have to use
[04:04:44] the limited fivestar credit card uh to
[04:04:47] obtain them I'm just
[04:04:50] saying I can only conclude that some
[04:04:53] powerful or wealthy party must have
[04:04:54] obtained them via illegal means
[04:04:57] deploying them as a private force of
[04:04:59] sorts what she's not going to be like de
[04:05:02] dude de's on the standard Banner there
[04:05:04] is no way they standard Banner her and
[04:05:06] do not act asley I would record myself
[04:05:09] eating an entire keyboard they're not
[04:05:11] going to do that we will bring the truth
[04:05:13] to light that's my father's true Last
[04:05:18] Wish regardless thank you for your help
[04:05:21] today
[04:05:22] cland but if you get any ideas tell me
[04:05:25] first I don't much appreciate being
[04:05:29] followed I do not think that they'll
[04:05:31] strike again anytime soon so I shall
[04:05:33] stop following you good day all no she
[04:05:36] looks too she looks looks too five star
[04:05:38] for the standard Banner there I have a
[04:05:40] theory and like when I watch Like an
[04:05:41] anime or something if I see someone with
[04:05:43] like colorful hair that the camera pans
[04:05:45] on you know they're going to be an
[04:05:46] important character always she has like
[04:05:48] that colorful purple like she's like
[04:05:51] yeah like that PO purple like fit hair
[04:05:53] hat like she has to be
[04:05:56] important de also okay de did look
[04:05:59] important they kind of did her dirty she
[04:06:00] was just an exception they just but I
[04:06:02] will say yeah they just did De dirty
[04:06:04] there's no excuse they just did De dirty
[04:06:06] with that in mind
[04:06:08] if you put Chlor Indi and DEA and you're
[04:06:11] like which one do you think is going to
[04:06:13] be more broken purple hair always beats
[04:06:15] any other color of hair or pink or white
[04:06:17] those are the op hair colors I'm sorry
[04:06:19] it just is what it is the more colorful
[04:06:21] the hair the more damage they
[04:06:25] deal but yeah they just did D dirty
[04:06:28] which uh I still don't forgive them for
[04:06:30] but
[04:06:36] yeah
[04:06:44] right I suppose that's the best new
[04:06:46] we've gotten today de moiselle I believe
[04:06:50] that Miss cand was being sincere with
[04:06:53] you if we tried we could attempt to thw
[04:06:57] relations a little if we tried I know I
[04:07:01] just oh whoa whoa whoa whoa she's what

[04:07:18] don't make a champion dualist not

[04:07:33] that were bad before dendro became okay
[04:07:35] with the exception of like Sara became
[04:07:39] good Dory if Sara didn't exist and you
[04:07:42] were in a funnel and you didn't have em
[04:07:43] Ryden and you didn't know that Sara was
[04:07:45] a character and you also lost your
[04:07:47] official at C you could use
[04:07:56] Dory but okay yeah we don't talk about
[04:07:59] her though Dory is not a character oh
[04:08:03] come now forget all that polite talk
[04:08:06] that wasn't really a farewell meal we
[04:08:08] had back there not for me anyway in

[04:08:20] need to thank me it will take stop

[04:08:33] actually Navia how did you know that we
[04:08:35] were in danger you sure did show up in
[04:08:38] the nick of time Nick that's me well to
[04:08:40] be honest you're the one who tipped us
[04:08:42] off Pon not as wholesome huh really Pon
[04:08:46] contributed
[04:08:48] somehow that actually [ __ ] with me yes
[04:08:52] all thanks to you what's the most broken
[04:08:54] wholesome
[04:08:55] character I guess Shang Ling's wholesome
[04:08:57] okay never mind I take that back I just
[04:08:59] she gave me too much like white blind
[04:09:02] looked Less in the cut scene was less
[04:09:04] like intense than Chlor Indi
[04:09:08] and then was being like giving me like
[04:09:09] Amber Vibes but I guess a lot of the
[04:09:11] wholesome characters like Shang langing
[04:09:12] and like Nita are kind of broken so okay
[04:09:15] we'll see hopefully uh how did that help
[04:09:20] after we parted ways I was on the way
[04:09:22] back to one of our bases when I suddenly
[04:09:24] thought of what you said that the font
[04:09:26] tasted kind of salty and
[04:09:30] icky oh that's what I missed okay I'm
[04:09:33] sorry for skipping that line but she
[04:09:35] just said it okay she said it now I know
[04:09:37] you know you have to get mad at me okay
[04:09:39] okay the font tasted salty and icky what
[04:09:41] the [ __ ] okay someone [ __ ] spit in it
[04:09:46] what do you mean font only comes in
[04:09:49] sweet flavors true so how could it have
[04:09:52] tasted salty the color of the drink if I
[04:09:55] recall had also been a bit off I thought
[04:09:57] it was Fanta was that actually font
[04:09:59] spiked with water from the primordial
[04:10:02] sea like I know it's spelled with an A
[04:10:04] but how do you pronounce it you hadn't
[04:10:06] drunk that cup for me
[04:10:08] Spina dula is preparing the grandest of
[04:10:11] awards for saving the boss okay I've
[04:10:14] heard people pronounced Fanta font
[04:10:16] though which is why I don't
[04:10:19] know huh
[04:10:22] really I sent people to Hotel dor to
[04:10:25] investigate but whoever did this left no
[04:10:27] Trace at
[04:10:31] all that's when I figured out that you
[04:10:33] might be in danger and hurried here as
[04:10:35] quickly as I could what
[04:10:38] why would they go after us too all we
[04:10:40] did was defend Linny and court and help
[04:10:42] clear his
[04:10:44] name now we're caught up in this mess
[04:10:46] too well you did foil a plan that they
[04:10:49] were probably pretty proud of true and
[04:10:51] almost got their name in the process
[04:10:52] true speaking of which did
[04:10:56] anything primordial seawater Well it
[04:10:59] can't be a coincidence that the traveler
[04:11:01] fainted just now she said that she heard
[04:11:04] that voice calling for Vash again sus
[04:11:07] and this time Pon heard it too but it
[04:11:10] was real faint according to L the
[04:11:13] ability to hear voices like that has to
[04:11:14] do one sensitivity to the hydro
[04:11:17] element does that mean the primordial
[04:11:20] seawater raises someone's sensitivity to
[04:11:22] hydro when it's used on people who are
[04:11:24] not from Fontaine that doesn't sound
[04:11:27] like too much of a bad thing to be
[04:11:28] honest new Intel while you well let's
[04:11:33] hear it shall We The Voice in the font
[04:11:35] belong to one of the missing women a
[04:11:36] person named vashi was a witness when
[04:11:37] she dissolved oh that is
[04:11:45] important V that name doesn't ring a
[04:11:49] bell I suppose he hasn't stepped forward
[04:11:51] as a witness in court lately since he
[04:11:53] saw that young woman dissolve he was at
[04:11:56] least at the crime scene but he never
[04:11:58] gave testimony or any information
[04:12:00] regarding people dissolving in the
[04:12:01] primordial seawater we should search for
[04:12:03] him could he have been threatened let's
[04:12:07] find
[04:12:07] thank you this is very important alled
[04:12:11] we will continue to

[04:15:06] like tough times for

[04:15:10] the people that does sound like it's
[04:15:12] worth
[04:15:13] it to be honest our financial situation
[04:15:16] was a lot better back when my father was
[04:15:18] in charge a few years
[04:15:21] ago I'm afraid I'm not quite his equal
[04:15:24] your father he was the previous boss of
[04:15:28] spina d rosula right how did he deaz if
[04:15:34] you'll allow me to explain I no
[04:15:37] I'll explain it myself I suppose I he
[04:15:40] was trying to [ __ ] MPL and as
[04:15:43] partners this is something I hope they
[04:15:45] can
[04:15:46] understand my father's name is callus
[04:15:49] yes same one they call callus the
[04:15:52] Unfaithful in the streets the UNF years
[04:15:55] ago he was accused of murdering his own
[04:15:57] friend but he chose a duel to defend his
[04:16:00] honor instead of standing trial he died
[04:16:04] in the Duelist ring oh he died to
[04:16:06] [ __ ] chlorine cuz she's the duel hey
[04:16:09] I know your father's Unfaithful I would
[04:16:11] be faithful just so you know it sorry
[04:16:15] I'll save it for n yet I'm sorry I'm
[04:16:16] sorry let me keep going let me keep
[04:16:17] going okay so he died in the du Ring
[04:16:18] probably to [ __ ] clind we'll see
[04:16:20] though I do not believe my father was a
[04:16:23] murderer I'm sure he was set up at the
[04:16:26] time I believed that if he only stood
[04:16:28] trial and was duly investigated
[04:16:30] something a Miss would crop up and prove
[04:16:32] his innocence but strangely he not only
[04:16:36] requested The Duel himself but rumor has
[04:16:39] it that even after being seriously
[04:16:42] injured to the point where he could be
[04:16:43] deemed as having lost the D he refused
[04:16:47] to surrender determined to die in the
[04:16:51] arena 3 years later I still don't
[04:16:54] understand why he did that how could he
[04:16:57] protect his honor if he's
[04:17:00] dead if anything he gave up his chance
[04:17:03] to defend
[04:17:04] himself the closest piece of in I have
[04:17:07] is that my father had been investigating
[04:17:09] the serial disappearances case at the
[04:17:11] time of his death do you not have like a
[04:17:13] notebook that you could why you're so
[04:17:14] determined to get to the bottom of that
[04:17:17] case that's right I've also tried to
[04:17:20] investigate the murder
[04:17:23] end to run it back a single new clue in
[04:17:26] my countless
[04:17:27] review record however I believe that if
[04:17:31] the murder case is related to those
[04:17:33] behind the disappearances they must know
[04:17:36] something
[04:17:37] I must know what really happened was my
[04:17:40] father coerced framed even if he really
[04:17:43] did kill his friend I must get to the
[04:17:47] truth if only he'd been more open with
[04:17:50] me when he was still
[04:17:51] alive he even hid the fact that my
[04:17:54] mother died due to complications when
[04:17:56] giving birth to me S now here I am
[04:17:59] investigating his
[04:18:02] death you really are a handful aren't
[04:18:04] you
[04:18:05] Papa
[04:18:09] deisel please if there is anything I can
[04:18:12] do anything at all did did let me just
[04:18:15] say we're quite alike in the sense that
[04:18:17] we're looking for Truth for our family
[04:18:18] bro her mom died giving birth to her and
[04:18:21] then her dad died like defending some
[04:18:23] [ __ ] all we're doing is finding our
[04:18:25] brother our brother oh no my brother
[04:18:28] that's it that's literally
[04:18:30] it we could have lived a comfortable
[04:18:32] life with [ __ ] with [ __ ] any of
[04:18:34] the people we met th far
[04:18:37] I'm sorry there's more to that I know I
[04:18:38] know there's more low to to lumine but
[04:18:41] I I also will never believe that Master
[04:18:44] call murdered any yeah also our brother
[04:18:46] is a criminal the head of the the two of
[04:18:49] you I mean I guess he's probably like
[04:18:50] mind controlled but still he defin much
[04:18:53] good in life yet all it took was one
[04:18:56] murder case for him to be dubbed callous
[04:18:58] the
[04:18:59] Unfaithful even our supporters decreased
[04:19:02] greatly due to that incident hence our
[04:19:05] strain finances
[04:19:07] at present wait if callus was such a
[04:19:10] good man wouldn't people at least be a
[04:19:13] little suspicious when he was
[04:19:15] accused no perhaps people just that kind
[04:19:19] of drama it's not something exclusive to
[04:19:22] people from Fontaine really everyone's
[04:19:24] like that people love watching the evil
[04:19:28] turn over a new Leaf but they also enjoy
[04:19:31] watching good people fall into an abyss
[04:19:33] from one slip up just as much but how
[04:19:38] never mind if callus was really falsely
[04:19:41] accused we have to find the truth he
[04:19:44] didn't deserve to have that happen to
[04:19:46] him and there is one other thing Master
[04:19:50] call
[04:19:51] is we figured that on our own it was M
[04:19:55] cland oh
[04:19:58] her well then isn't that yeah that's not
[04:20:02] the Miss Garand has always placed great
[04:20:05] emphasis on the honorable nature of the
[04:20:08] duel if her opponent doesn't yield she
[04:20:11] will not stop either she knew Master
[04:20:14] callus beforehand and greatly respected
[04:20:16] him but I mean she probably could have
[04:20:18] just been like I mean she probably could
[04:20:20] have been like you know maybe I won't
[04:20:22] kill my my friend's dad but is what it
[04:20:24] is I
[04:20:25] guess it's not that I don't understand
[04:20:28] her at all but I I just can't deal with
[04:20:32] this yet don't worry Navia hon knows how
[04:20:35] you feel
[04:20:37] you don't have to force yourself to do
[04:20:39] that afterward Miss Coran told us that
[04:20:42] at the start of the jewel Master callus
[04:20:45] requested that she ensure de marel
[04:20:47] Nava's
[04:20:50] safety yeah that makes sense he did
[04:20:53] indicate to die yeah he did intend to
[04:20:55] die in the D yes that is our oh papa
[04:20:59] what Madness drove you to ask the person
[04:21:00] who killed you to take care of me all
[04:21:03] right anyway that's the information I
[04:21:06] want wanted to share with you even if it
[04:21:08] did sound like I was just yeah yeah I
[04:21:10] don't think clar's in the wrong but
[04:21:12] still she could have just like tied him
[04:21:13] up [ __ ] it you lost and then he's not
[04:21:16] dead then goes to [ __ ] jail or
[04:21:18] whatever but I mean I guess he just
[04:21:19] wanted to die so
[04:21:20] whatever huh I mean no like actually
[04:21:23] like not in a weird way just like don't
[04:21:24] kill him [ __ ] cut his legs there you
[04:21:26] go he can't
[04:21:28] walk I know she just did what I know I
[04:21:31] know I know whatever thanks you two
[04:21:34] should go and rest this was quite a day
[04:21:36] after all yeah why are you question
[04:21:40] marking I'd rather not have legs than be
[04:21:42] dead what are you talking about relax
[04:21:43] and get some sleep we will ensure you
[04:21:45] rest
[04:21:47] soundly ahaa mutilation so funny are you
[04:21:50] brain damaged actually like I'm
[04:21:52] concerned what are you saying what are
[04:21:54] you talking about I'm saying I'd rather
[04:21:57] not kill my friend's
[04:22:00] dad I'm not laughing actually yeah what
[04:22:03] okay I'm not laughing at the act of
[04:22:05] cutting his legs I'm saying I'd rather
[04:22:07] do that than kill
[04:22:10] him anyways person's
[04:22:18] weird uh what the [ __ ] is this let me
[04:22:22] redo it I think I missed it yeah I did
[04:22:24] miss
[04:22:34] it they're all friends yet I I mean fair
[04:22:36] enough but
[04:22:38] still like it makes sense for her to
[04:22:40] kill him I'm just saying like if she
[04:22:42] didn't want to she you know but it does
[04:22:44] make sense like I get it where did the
[04:22:47] other two Go Master duelist opponent
[04:22:49] doesn't yield you're going to kill them
[04:22:51] but like place of origin and where we
[04:22:53] have our headquarters there's not much
[04:22:55] for them to do here at the moment P gets
[04:22:58] the feeling that you're just trying to
[04:23:00] get them off your
[04:23:02] back but never mind that when did you
[04:23:06] back were you waiting here the whole
[04:23:08] time no I just returned after going out
[04:23:11] for a while I it's also Mar I mean like
[04:23:15] you probably wouldn't want to live after
[04:23:16] that though if you're getting
[04:23:17] disrespected like that I don't
[04:23:19] know how could I having such critical
[04:23:22] new evidence
[04:23:24] appear guess Pon wasn't speaking for
[04:23:28] unfortunately this name seems to have
[04:23:30] been wiped from existence it doesn't
[04:23:32] seem to have a match anywhere I suspect
[04:23:35] that those those behind this have
[04:23:37] already taken steps to hinder an
[04:23:39] investigation from this angle but that
[04:23:42] does prove that this F person is a key
[04:23:46] witness in the incident sus does that
[04:23:49] mean we too late though no there is one
[04:23:52] Ray of Hope one place in Fontaine that
[04:23:55] they would find almost impossible to
[04:23:58] threaten no matter how much they wanted
[04:24:00] to and that is the archives kept by
[04:24:03] Chief
[04:24:04] Justice okay don't worry Navia I'll go
[04:24:07] visit him no worries I'll take care of
[04:24:09] this you just stay here I'll go check up
[04:24:10] on him make sure you met is one of the
[04:24:13] young women who went missing recently we
[04:24:15] should be able to find some related
[04:24:17] information
[04:24:19] there so nervet maintains an archive of
[04:24:22] Case
[04:24:24] Files guess that's the hardworking chief
[04:24:26] justice for you in that case let's go
[04:24:28] talk to him um aren't you coming along
[04:24:32] now no no I got it don't worry Pon you
[04:24:34] can stay here too actually you can stay
[04:24:35] here too no it's nothing uhoh let's go
[04:24:38] see The Honorable chief
[04:24:41] justice
[04:24:43] uhoh
[04:24:44] okay Quest St
[04:24:48] complete that was uh I mean I guess that
[04:24:51] was like L right up ahead come on we got
[04:24:54] to learn Nava's
[04:24:56] past dual systems weird in general yeah
[04:24:59] I mean I assume that the moral of this
[04:25:01] story is that [ __ ] the whole justice
[04:25:03] system in this region is flawed I don't
[04:25:05] know maybe May that won't be the [ __ ]
[04:25:07] conclusion but it feels like it so we'll
[04:25:10] see hopefully hopefully they come to
[04:25:13] that realization but maybe not I mean I
[04:25:15] don't
[04:25:18] [Music]
[04:25:21] know please State your business here the
[04:25:23] chief justice is presently occupied with
[04:25:26] official
[04:25:28] matters this place does look pretty
[04:25:30] heavily guarded guess that proves that
[04:25:33] Net's files are really secure hey don't
[04:25:37] you recognize
[04:25:39] us huh who are you just to be clear I
[04:25:45] don't care who you are or who I like

[04:26:37] a normal take but like I feel like
[04:26:39] arar's the quest line was so good but it
[04:26:42] was nerfed because it was so [ __ ]
[04:26:43] long and not voice acted and you have to
[04:26:45] find 7 million so the most like the
[04:26:47] average player is going to [ __ ] hate
[04:26:48] it cuz they're like okay I don't want to
[04:26:49] do a 17 million hour Quest but like
[04:26:51] whenever if you actually do it it's like

[04:28:50] like there's like a bow at the end of
[04:28:51] his hair I didn't see
[04:28:53] that long as [ __ ] look at
[04:28:55] that I'm quite certain that no one by
[04:28:58] the name of V has been involved in any
[04:29:00] case criminal or civil in the past
[04:29:03] several years there are no record
[04:29:05] records of him either in the files or in
[04:29:08] my
[04:29:08] memory traveler what if it was really
[04:29:12] just a dream is that
[04:29:13] so okay no way she said what if it was a
[04:29:16] dream after what happened in [ __ ]
[04:29:17] sumaru we'll take our leave now do you
[04:29:19] not
[04:29:20] remember
[04:29:21] [Music]
[04:29:29] beep Miss Navia I can understand how you
[04:29:33] feel wait his eyes are [ __ ] pretty
[04:29:35] what the hell look at that was a truly
[04:29:36] exceptional man we deeply regret his
[04:29:41] passing
[04:29:47] dumb and what are you trying to say Miss
[04:29:51] noet
[04:29:53] uh-oh are you trying to console me
[04:29:56] extend chill he was just like your dad's
[04:29:58] cool express some tendril of regret yo
[04:30:02] you are not trying to do any of that I
[04:30:05] can hear it in your voice yo there's no
[04:30:08] emotion behind your words you only said
[04:30:11] those things because you felt like you
[04:30:13] should
[04:30:17] noo it's just like last time after my
[04:30:21] father took his place in the dualist
[04:30:23] ring I pushed through the guards to talk
[04:30:25] to you as a last resort she's kind of
[04:30:27] cooking but chill that you thought there
[04:30:29] was something fishy with the case yet
[04:30:31] you still allowed the D to go ahead in
[04:30:34] your eyes the value of a human life is
[04:30:37] nothing compared to those cold laws you
[04:30:39] hold so dear if you truly regret my
[04:30:42] father's death then why didn't you call
[04:30:45] a stop to the duel why didn't you give
[04:30:48] me the power to stop him from throwing
[04:30:50] his life away why did you just let him
[04:30:52] die AR's order is not his fault and
[04:30:54] hated by all okay maybe it was his fault
[04:30:56] everything was hanging on a thread at
[04:30:58] that moment just the tiniest effort
[04:31:02] could have changed everything there are
[04:31:05] still so many things I never got to tell
[04:31:07] him s so many questions he still owes me
[04:31:11] answers to if you really have no heart
[04:31:16] then just look me in the eyes I Navia
[04:31:20] will show you the true meaning of
[04:31:27] regret I'm sorry miss
[04:31:30] noia you and my father are truly alike
[04:31:34] you keep all kinds of things in your
[04:31:36] heart and never say a word to
[04:31:42] anyone it's not so much that you can't
[04:31:45] feel but that you would never express
[04:31:48] anything oh well in any case everyone
[04:31:51] already knows full well the apathy of
[04:31:54] the Chief Justice my apologies for
[04:31:57] taking my emotions out on you mure chief
[04:31:59] justice she's just leaving like let's go
[04:32:01] traveler and
[04:32:04] pon
[04:32:07] wait that's okay what the [ __ ] she just
[04:32:11] she just said what she had to say and
[04:32:12] peace I mean I mean fair
[04:32:16] enough I
[04:32:22] [Music]
[04:32:25] mean Navia are you
[04:32:29] okay wait it's
[04:32:32] raining rain cuz he's cry rying it's
[04:32:36] raining you're right wasn't it still
[04:32:39] sunny when we went into the building and
[04:32:41] there shouldn't be any active trials
[04:32:43] today now that I think of it on the day
[04:32:46] father was convicted of murder uh it
[04:32:47] might be spoilers cuz I remember seeing
[04:32:49] fan art of this so it might have debated
[04:32:51] all of me but
[04:32:52] like the [ __ ] this the the emo boy at
[04:32:55] the start was like when the rain dragon
[04:32:57] cries it rains and then he's probably
[04:32:59] crying now so it's raining so I assume
[04:33:01] that makes that that means that he's you
[04:33:03] know so that's probably what just
[04:33:04] happened but
[04:33:09] yeah what is it did you think of
[04:33:12] something
[04:33:15] s
[04:33:17] d p yet that makes me like him more
[04:33:20] though is that [ __ ] up I don't
[04:33:23] know yeah he was he probably didn't have
[04:33:25] a choice to be honest covered in the
[04:33:26] rain could fall there s why do you think
[04:33:30] the rain could have affected the crime
[04:33:31] scene that thought has occurred to us
[04:33:34] before we've even been expanded the
[04:33:36] search area to try to account for that
[04:33:38] but didn't find anything of
[04:33:42] value
[04:33:43] oh
[04:33:45] wait you don't mean wellit I didn't read
[04:33:47] know what I clicked on I'm a [ __ ]
[04:33:49] dumbass I heard what she said the fact
[04:33:51] that people can be turned into water
[04:33:53] you're saying that the true murderer
[04:33:55] could have been turned into water and
[04:33:57] then got washed away with the rain yeah
[04:34:01] and if that's what had happened then no
[04:34:03] one would have believed your dad even if
[04:34:04] he explained what he saw to the
[04:34:06] authorities I really think I found a
[04:34:09] true genius for a
[04:34:11] partner you're completely that's [ __ ]
[04:34:14] imagine how did I connect the dots
[04:34:16] earlier all right let's go to Pon with
[04:34:19] this new lead in mind we'll get to the
[04:34:21] bottom of my f imagine if [ __ ] go

[04:34:43] could have just not fought went to jail
[04:34:45] then his daughter would have proved his
[04:34:46] [ __ ] innocence cuz she's about to and
[04:34:48] then boom he's saved cuz we're about to
[04:34:50] be like oh he was innocent watch

[04:35:15] you yeah don't ego push true wa what a
[04:35:20] huge
[04:35:22] ship there's no need to be so surprised
[04:35:25] while it may look like a ship it's
[04:35:27] actually Spina Ro
[04:35:30] headquarters then n like my father was a
[04:35:33] noble like a great man and then Ka he
[04:35:36] talks about his story he's like yeah my
[04:35:38] ancestor I mean it's technically
[04:35:40] spoilers but we're literally doing an
[04:35:42] arch Quest yeah my Anor [ __ ] made the
[04:35:44] abyss okay well thanks K my father was
[04:35:47] the one who asked for it to be built
[04:35:49] like this perhaps our taste and exterior
[04:35:52] design is the only thing we occasionally
[04:35:54] had in common a gigantic and glamorous
[04:35:56] ship embodies Discovery opportunity
[04:36:00] ambition and Conquest it symbolizes
[04:36:02] Spina D rula's bright and Limitless
[04:36:05] future and P that you were bluffing when
[04:36:08] you said Spina dula had a glorious P I'm
[04:36:11] going to look up Spina dula I want to
[04:36:12] see if that means grp with such a hisory
[04:36:15] I mean I assume before I Google it it
[04:36:17] looks like spine of the Rose or
[04:36:18] something just from like the words she's
[04:36:21] been convinced oh it's literally all
[04:36:22] genin when I look it up okay well well
[04:36:25] is where
[04:36:27] began it's our main base our home Rose
[04:36:30] thorn thorn of the Rose oh that makes
[04:36:33] sense that makes sense
[04:36:43] took inspo from France lore FR France
[04:36:46] like the the country we saw in um
[04:36:48] history
[04:36:54] class where am I
[04:36:59] going wait how the [ __ ] did I get
[04:37:02] here um
[04:37:05] all
[04:37:09] right it's fine we'll make
[04:37:14] it
[04:37:17] forign quit following me swen
[04:37:21] fury search forth I like how yolan and
[04:37:25] scara's like biggest enemies are like
[04:37:27] slightly slanted
[04:37:34] slopes Mose we're
[04:37:37] back apologies for the wait demoiselle
[04:37:40] apologies you said before that you still
[04:37:42] had some business at the court what
[04:37:44] brings you back to than of a plus one
[04:37:47] raid huge about that it's because my
[04:37:51] partner here reminded me of something
[04:37:52] really important you see what if my
[04:37:55] father's case had something to do with
[04:37:57] water from the primordial sea you still
[04:37:59] remember right Belo on that night it was
[04:38:02] raining yes the case was quite similar
[04:38:05] to that of Mr Lin both were what you'd
[04:38:08] call impossible
[04:38:11] murders can the Mas mind be the same
[04:38:13] person could you tell us a bit more
[04:38:15] about what happened before Oh yes of
[04:38:18] course of course oh oh but it was her
[04:38:20] not him something called synth began to
[04:38:22] gain popularity in syn at a glance it
[04:38:26] was a kind of drink that could excite
[04:38:28] your mood literally abant huc like 70%
[04:38:31] alcohol wait didn't that guard guy who
[04:38:35] turned into water also mentioned that
[04:38:37] the primordial water could be used to
[04:38:39] produce some kind of potion yes he did
[04:38:43] considering what we know now it's almost
[04:38:45] certain created using water primordial
[04:38:48] sea if you drink s for an extended
[04:38:51] amount of time you'll suffer many side
[04:38:53] effects such as losing the ability to
[04:38:55] focus or control your emotions I mean
[04:38:57] that's literally alcohol so it
[04:38:59] completely you'll experience flashes of
[04:39:02] also literally aliy while lacking energy
[04:39:04] to do anything it's an extremely
[04:39:07] dangerous substance as he oversaw P my
[04:39:10] father was compelled to put a stop to
[04:39:12] syn abuse and called for a complete ban
[04:39:15] of it boss's uncompromising attitude
[04:39:18] incurred the synth vendor's wrath but no
[04:39:21] matter how much they threatened or
[04:39:23] bribed him he refused to yield not only
[04:39:26] that boss became determined to find the
[04:39:29] Mastermind behind the synth operation
[04:39:32] and put an end to the problem once D
[04:39:34] holy uh I'm not going to say that I am
[04:39:36] going to say
[04:39:38] thaty so he could never get anything
[04:39:41] respectfully respectfully respectfully
[04:39:42] respectfully respect sold the stuff and
[04:39:44] weren't privy to the rest of the
[04:39:45] operation respectfully man can't I
[04:39:47] appreciate the art from the artist
[04:39:49] that's all Conta the deers I anything
[04:39:51] weird and cultivate personal
[04:39:52] relationships with them finally he was
[04:39:56] able to convince someone to become his
[04:39:58] informant the man's name was jacqu Jac
[04:40:01] he felt greatly ashamed about his work
[04:40:03] after seeing many families destroy it's
[04:40:05] like open okay I'm sorry my father B at
[04:40:09] his Countryside estate he planned to
[04:40:12] meet up and exchange information with
[04:40:13] shc over some food but then we heard two
[04:40:17] gunshots from the courtyard we raced to
[04:40:20] the scene and found my father oh still
[04:40:22] holding a gun and I mean Bas honestly W
[04:40:25] father for doing that if he
[04:40:27] did how did that happen aren't they on
[04:40:31] the same
[04:40:32] side sounds just like Lenny's C doesn't
[04:40:35] it in both cases the culprit seemed
[04:40:38] obvious but neither appeared to have any
[04:40:40] motive at all looking back on it though
[04:40:44] I now believe the most important clue
[04:40:46] was something we all overlooked at the
[04:40:48] time there were pieces of clothing left
[04:40:50] at the
[04:40:57] scene precisely it's all thanks to you
[04:41:00] that I made the connection now back then
[04:41:02] we all just thought they were some
[04:41:04] costumes that jacqu used to disguise
[04:41:06] himself at the banquet but considering
[04:41:09] it now it's almost certain that they
[04:41:11] belong to a third person at the scene
[04:41:14] with one extra person we'll actually
[04:41:17] maybe I I'm just too tired and I didn't
[04:41:18] [ __ ] remember but I don't remember
[04:41:20] what the wait what the [ __ ] is the
[04:41:21] relationship between the father and J
[04:41:23] thought J was just the dude that made
[04:41:24] the thing but maybe I [ __ ] am too
[04:41:26] tired to focus right maybe your father
[04:41:28] going argument with ja but it's also
[04:41:30] possible that the third person was to
[04:41:31] blame you're right we still don't know
[04:41:34] what happened
[04:41:35] but my intuition tells me that we track
[04:41:38] to figuring it all
[04:41:40] out I'm
[04:41:42] finally okay maybe not base to shoot him
[04:41:44] then okay my bad good I mean his fast
[04:41:48] actions were so [ __ ] but it's unlikely
[04:41:51] that he turned on boss with zero warning
[04:41:54] I think this third person is probably
[04:41:57] the key to the full truth on that note
[04:42:01] however even though this maybe don't
[04:42:04] shoot the
[04:42:05] as you're your father's Butler I must
[04:42:07] still offer a word of warning our
[04:42:10] opponent is Insidious and cruel they are
[04:42:14] extremely difficult to deal with and
[04:42:16] boss has already lost his life trying to
[04:42:18] bring them to justice even though Spina
[04:42:21] de rosula has lost most of its former
[04:42:23] glory Pon has
[04:42:26] welcomed peace and we to live out our
[04:42:30] lives there's no need to follow your
[04:42:33] father's path it would be both wise and
[04:42:36] in line with boss's wishes to step back
[04:42:40] and give up on the case if that's indeed
[04:42:43] what he wished for then he should have
[04:42:45] told me that himself was I not the
[04:42:48] closest person to him and yet I was the
[04:42:51] one most kept in the dark what was the
[04:42:54] point of him dying without sharing any
[04:42:56] of the secrets he knew did he manage to
[04:42:59] protect anything in the end synth is
[04:43:03] still here
[04:43:05] Callis the Unfaithful is still his
[04:43:07] epithet and spina D rosula is barely
[04:43:11] getting
[04:43:12] by nothing has changed did he think I'd
[04:43:15] just accept his meaningless death and
[04:43:18] live out my life just as meaninglessly
[04:43:21] I've never accepted that ever not since
[04:43:24] that day and certainly not now I want to
[04:43:27] find out the real answer for everyone's
[04:43:30] sake for the missing girls for the
[04:43:33] victims and for for myself Saia this is
[04:43:37] indeed the best moment to act your
[04:43:40] partner appears to be quite reliable and
[04:43:42] more importantly
[04:43:44] demoiselle I think you're also ready to
[04:43:47] take this on okay do know something else
[04:43:50] Malo yes I do in fact even before that
[04:43:55] banquet boss already knew of the
[04:43:57] connection between synth and the serial
[04:43:59] disappearances case but what drove all
[04:44:02] the tensions to the boiling point was
[04:44:04] the Revelation that you de moiselle been
[04:44:07] selected as the next Target to
[04:44:10] disappear
[04:44:14] what boss also didn't tell you that
[04:44:18] he had been diagnosed with a rare
[04:44:21] illness the doctors told him elazar we
[04:44:24] cured that we did the the sumaru
[04:44:29] thing's case caused him great
[04:44:33] anxiety five years was nowhere near
[04:44:36] enough time to resolve this
[04:44:38] long-standing
[04:44:39] conflict but once he passed away all the
[04:44:42] danger would pass on to you knowing all
[04:44:46] of this he decided to use one final
[04:44:49] intimidation tactic before his death he
[04:44:52] claimed to have already gotten his hands
[04:44:55] on some key incriminating evidence for
[04:44:57] the other side and even told some
[04:45:00] members of spad De rosula about the
[04:45:02] details but as long as you you remain
[04:45:05] safe he would not share the evidence
[04:45:07] with the public if something were to
[04:45:09] happen to you then he and all those he
[04:45:12] told would immediately expose all they
[04:45:14] knew about synth and the Disappeared
[04:45:16] victims right so nobody would be as
[04:45:19] we've seen boss's tactic has worked even
[04:45:22] though boss has been gone for a long
[04:45:23] time the other side has not tried to
[04:45:26] take de wasel's life no I don't believe
[04:45:30] it he never appeared to look sick to me
[04:45:33] no father wants their daughter to see
[04:45:35] them weak and Haggard especially someone
[04:45:38] as proud as
[04:45:40] boss that's true dying in a jewel and
[04:45:43] suffering lasting dishonor as the
[04:45:46] Unfaithful dude my okay Dad L I guess my
[04:45:50] I so pissed at him for this to this day
[04:45:52] when my dad had Co we have okay I have
[04:45:55] in my extended family there's like a few
[04:45:56] like medical professionals like my my
[04:45:58] cousin's a doctor and like literally
[04:46:01] like when he had covid it was like
[04:46:03] really bad for him but anytime we'd ask
[04:46:05] or check in on him or like whatever
[04:46:07] you'd never say anything and then
[04:46:08] there's a point where he like
[04:46:10] literally I he literally rewrote his
[04:46:12] will without [ __ ] telling us and I
[04:46:15] was like dude we have like we could have
[04:46:16] done whatever he's fine all's good now
[04:46:19] but
[04:46:20] like [ __ ] I I don't know so I
[04:46:23] swear it's like they don't want to just
[04:46:24] they don't want to let anyone know
[04:46:25] they're in pain it's like
[04:46:27] bro okay so he chose to die inide that
[04:46:30] was like two years ago so that he could
[04:46:32] protect me I'm a afraid you're not
[04:46:35] understanding this correctly
[04:46:37] demoiselle what boss wanted to hand to
[04:46:40] you was not a
[04:46:42] parasol but a sword if boss's Spirit
[04:46:46] could hear you telling me that you want
[04:46:48] to find the answer for the sake of
[04:46:50] everyone involved I mean hey he beat it
[04:46:52] but still it's like extremely
[04:46:56] proud that
[04:46:58] fool couldn't he have just given it to
[04:47:00] me straight no he might have set up
[04:47:04] everything precisely because he never
[04:47:07] thought I'd be able to understand him is
[04:47:10] that the amount of confidence he had in
[04:47:12] me and what if I was never able to make
[04:47:15] it to where I am now s he wanted to give
[04:47:18] you the choice to live how you want or
[04:47:20] he gave you the choice to live how you
[04:47:21] want
[04:47:23] yeah I suppose that's true with the way
[04:47:26] he'd set things up if I had wanted I
[04:47:29] could have just lived out my life
[04:47:30] without a care in the world but
[04:47:33] thankfully he rarely talked to me about
[04:47:35] complex matters and thus understood
[04:47:38] little of me as a
[04:47:39] person in this case he really didn't
[04:47:42] need to give me an easy way
[04:47:45] out Malo what was the key evidence that
[04:47:48] he shared with you
[04:47:51] okay actually it's fine I was just going
[04:47:53] to say you could have said this before
[04:47:54] we went and like talked to net and all
[04:47:56] that but all good I mean fine the
[04:47:57] location where synth is produced
[04:48:02] essentially it's the enemy
[04:48:04] headquarters when he was threatening the
[04:48:07] enemy boss didn't share the specifics of
[04:48:10] the incriminating evidence he found but
[04:48:13] if you want to use it against the enemy
[04:48:16] you'll still have to take several things
[04:48:18] into
[04:48:19] consideration why if we know where the
[04:48:22] pl wait why so typ are you going to do
[04:48:23] all the acts today at Zio clueless isn't
[04:48:26] this the last act isn't it just two this
[04:48:28] is two what do you mean there's dude
[04:48:30] they're they're literally about to
[04:48:31] finish you mustn't forget why against a
[04:48:34] mysterious and
[04:48:36] dangerous that's been in operation for
[04:48:39] decades there's no telling what might be
[04:48:42] lying in wait at their
[04:48:43] headquarters we also have no idea what
[04:48:46] kind of evidence we may be able to find
[04:48:48] inside nor what people we may be able to
[04:48:51] capture the only thing is a single visit
[04:48:54] to their headquarters it looks like the
[04:48:55] ACT about to end but I remember people
[04:48:56] telling me that act two makes you like
[04:49:00] finina more and we haven't seen her at
[04:49:01] all in this act so that means there's
[04:49:03] probably at least another like [ __ ]
[04:49:04] hour but anyways the worst case would be
[04:49:07] that we leave
[04:49:09] empty-handed or like at least you get to
[04:49:11] know her more I don't Know full
[04:49:13] retaliation maybe not I mean maybe not
[04:49:15] but in that case why not work with the
[04:49:17] Fontaine authorities well you saw one of
[04:49:19] them dissolved during Mr Linn's case I
[04:49:22] don't like her more and I did act to
[04:49:23] okay we'll idea just how thoroughly they
[04:49:25] may have been
[04:49:27] infiltrated that's
[04:49:29] true seems my father really had no
[04:49:31] choice but things are different now it
[04:49:35] should be a lot easier to prove the
[04:49:37] other side's guilt now that we've
[04:49:39] connected synth with a disappearances
[04:49:40] case you sound like you've put a lot of
[04:49:43] I Am The Butler after all I live but to
[04:49:46] serve the boss and Deo a chat I like him
[04:49:50] always do we get to learn more about
[04:49:51] silver cuz all of you guys love [ __ ]
[04:49:53] silver what did he do he didn't say
[04:49:55] anything he was just like I have Shades
[04:49:57] spend my time I guess that's enough
[04:49:59] performing basic investigations I guess
[04:50:02] having having Shades is is
[04:50:04] all right fair for all of that he's not
[04:50:06] even here have you discovered anything
[04:50:09] new in the past few years me think one
[04:50:14] conclusion I came to was that the enemy
[04:50:16] must quite familiar with Spa d rosula
[04:50:20] when I announced orders to the
[04:50:21] organization's members on deo's behalf I
[04:50:25] used to deliber he did have the almonds
[04:50:26] ready that is true he had the almonds
[04:50:28] ready for the [ __ ] macaroons true if
[04:50:31] the vendors didn't change their plans
[04:50:33] then the individual uals informed of our
[04:50:35] orders must be innocent if the vendors
[04:50:37] packed up and fled however then someone
[04:50:40] must have given them the news after
[04:50:42] several rounds of testing and
[04:50:44] investigative tracing I've narrowed the
[04:50:47] suspect list down to three people okay
[04:50:50] three the first is floron Spa d rula's
[04:50:53] senior
[04:50:54] advisor okay he's dressed like LOF
[04:50:57] floron no one dressed like L would do
[04:50:59] anything wrong but I also think he was
[04:51:01] one of the people boss trusted the most
[04:51:04] which also means that he was someone who
[04:51:06] understood boss really well okay thanks
[04:51:09] to his position within boss's innermost
[04:51:11] Circle he always knew our upcoming plan
[04:51:14] there's someone else like him too Marcel
[04:51:18] Carri bear oh my God it's notri keep
[04:51:21] Uncle
[04:51:25] Marcel Marcel Inon the boss helped it to
[04:51:29] grow to its current size and prominence
[04:51:32] in the beginning there were were only
[04:51:34] reselling some daily Goods but now
[04:51:37] they're one of the richest guilds around
[04:51:39] with a lot of Business Connection so
[04:51:41] they're like a sister organ yes you can
[04:51:44] say that okay when we were fighting
[04:51:46] against the synth dealers they provided
[04:51:48] us with plenty of support it's a bit
[04:51:52] difficult to imagine someone using their
[04:51:53] own money to hunt down themselves the
[04:51:57] final suspect is
[04:51:59] tii responsible for coordinating
[04:52:02] information a get it's him it's him get
[04:52:05] him get him get him although the gods
[04:52:07] mostly leave us to our own devices there
[04:52:10] are still many activities we have to
[04:52:12] report to the local authorities since
[04:52:14] tyry is always in the know about our
[04:52:16] current activities he could
[04:52:18] theoretically always plan one step ahead
[04:52:21] I
[04:52:22] see these are all people who I
[04:52:25] communicate with quite regularly to
[04:52:27] think that the enemy we've been fighting
[04:52:29] against has been right next to me all
[04:52:31] along among those Trust the most sorry
[04:52:35] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll stop too hard
[04:52:37] if you want to investigate them please
[04:52:39] take every precaution to not alert the
[04:52:41] Quarry judging from our experience the
[04:52:44] enemy is extremely
[04:52:47] cautious of course and thank you Malo
[04:52:50] you're too kind my lady you're too kind
[04:52:53] my lady I forget proving boss after that

[04:54:22] after all this
[04:54:24] time after what happened I didn't know
[04:54:27] how I was supposed to face the two of
[04:54:29] you ah if it's about that there's no
[04:54:32] need to apologize ol after my husband
[04:54:35] died Spina dula sent us a lot of MOA and
[04:54:39] support but aren't things nothing
[04:54:42] compared to the loss of
[04:54:45] jacqu I can understand the kind of pain
[04:54:49] that comes with losing a father so
[04:54:51] needlessly okay I'm going to say it I'm
[04:54:53] not going to say it you don't understand
[04:54:55] at all I didn't know how to face you
[04:54:58] because I didn't know what I could
[04:54:59] possibly bring as a consolation gift I
[04:55:02] know only the full truth could bring
[04:55:04] closure to you
[04:55:06] mhm I'm sorry I appreciate the sentiment
[04:55:11] but you don't have to carry all that
[04:55:13] guilt on the matter regarding my husband
[04:55:16] my daughter and I have more or less
[04:55:18] found our answer already would you mind
[04:55:21] sharing it with me I really can't
[04:55:24] believe that my father could ever bring
[04:55:27] himself to shoot jock I always knew that
[04:55:29] my husband's money was earned through
[04:55:31] others suffering he told told me
[04:55:33] countless times that if he could turn
[04:55:35] back the clock he would never go into
[04:55:37] the synth business again he had many
[04:55:40] regrets and felt that he took the idea
[04:55:42] of providing for his family too little
[04:55:44] he was literally Walter White longest
[04:55:46] time he thought Mora was everything so
[04:55:49] when Mr callus came to him with a
[04:55:50] proposal he accepted it almost
[04:55:53] immediately he tried to be as careful as
[04:55:55] he could but even he was still found out
[04:55:58] by the higher ups they found out about
[04:56:02] his betrayal Papa didn't say that
[04:56:04] exactly but Papa did tell me that I
[04:56:07] should never be ungrateful who asked
[04:56:09] before he left that day he told me that
[04:56:12] he had no choice it was only later that
[04:56:15] I realized it was his final farewell to
[04:56:18] wait does that mean someone ordered Jack
[04:56:20] to take out callus I don't know that for
[04:56:23] sure but you could say that's the
[04:56:26] conclusion I eventually came to okay
[04:56:29] that's [ __ ] which is why I'm the one
[04:56:32] who should feel guilty
[04:56:33] callus had always taken great care of us
[04:56:36] both when he was still alive and after
[04:56:38] he passed away wait Jack wanted to kill
[04:56:40] her dad he fired the shot that killed my
[04:56:42] husband it was likely in
[04:56:45] self-defense it is impossible for me to
[04:56:48] hate him for what he but mama why is
[04:56:51] Papa still the bad guy if he did the
[04:56:54] right thing shut up kid go do your
[04:56:56] homework wanted to be a good man so why
[04:56:58] did he have to do a Bad Thing P off the
[04:57:00] cliff okay I'm okay well things aren't
[04:57:02] always as they seem you still feel Papa
[04:57:06] was a good man right I'm kidding I'm
[04:57:08] kidding yeah Papa was a really good man
[04:57:12] the best in the whole world too far too
[04:57:14] far too far too far then you should hold
[04:57:15] on to that if a good man had to do a bad
[04:57:20] thing then he must have had his reasons
[04:57:23] regardless of whether he left you a
[04:57:25] parasol or a
[04:57:27] sword he must have done so to give you a
[04:57:30] better life true oh thank you for
[04:57:34] everything you've told me I will
[04:57:37] definitely find the truth n is so
[04:57:39] wholesome the current state of things is
[04:57:41] not something I'm willing to just sit
[04:57:43] back and accept thank you even though
[04:57:46] your personality is quite different from
[04:57:48] your fathers your determination when you
[04:57:51] speak is really similar you really think
[04:57:54] so that's the first time anyone said
[04:57:58] that to me

[04:58:04] okay what up Adele I'll leave my husband

[04:58:33] don't worry let's investigate the three
[04:58:36] suspects
[04:58:39] [Music]
[04:58:41] next greetings boss how may I be of
[04:58:45] assistance today I don't like this guy's
[04:58:47] beard I don't like his neck beard it's
[04:58:49] giving me bad vibes I'm sure you've
[04:58:51] heard about what happened at the Opera
[04:58:52] House someone got turned into water
[04:58:55] right in front of us yeah I've heard
[04:58:58] with something that dramatic I'm sure
[04:59:00] journalists will milk it for all its
[04:59:02] worth weird no it's it's like not full
[04:59:05] it's just like bottom it also reminds
[04:59:08] Fang called him zff he does not look
[04:59:10] like zff father that is an insult to zff
[04:59:13] looks way better than that we found some
[04:59:14] clothes left at the scene zff
[04:59:26] 77 Z see Z actually he actually has a
[04:59:31] beard that's like more full this guy
[04:59:33] just has just just like the chin strap
[04:59:35] after my partner here put the dots
[04:59:37] together for me I feel like we should
[04:59:39] try to reopen his
[04:59:42] case can you do me a favor and try to
[04:59:44] recall what happened that
[04:59:46] night I I can
[04:59:49] try let me
[04:59:51] think Mr callus was feeling pretty
[04:59:54] upbeat that day so he was drinking and
[04:59:58] bantering Away with us at the
[05:00:00] table who is the judge f
[05:00:04] Zio no one no
[05:00:08] one just after that he told us that he
[05:00:12] wanted to go get some fresh air so we
[05:00:15] let him go without thinking much of it
[05:00:17] who knew that we would hear two gunshots
[05:00:19] ring out right
[05:00:23] after my first reaction was that Mr
[05:00:25] Call's life was in danger so I grabbed
[05:00:28] my holster and made a Mad Dash toward
[05:00:30] the scene but when I got there
[05:00:33] it was already too late Mr Callas was
[05:00:37] standing over a dead body with a gun so
[05:00:39] you also remember two gunshots then
[05:00:41] indeed okay the guards reason being Mr
[05:00:45] callus had left his gun on the table I
[05:00:48] even hopefully we get to do the actual
[05:00:50] like case trial thing in this act cuz if
[05:00:52] we acquire a bunch of evidence and then
[05:00:54] we wait till we have to wait till next
[05:00:55] patch to actually do anything I'm going
[05:00:57] be [ __ ] pissed judging by so he would
[05:01:00] it's prob going to be that to bringt not
[05:01:04] the gun he was holding probably yeah
[05:01:06] that makes a lot of sense so you're
[05:01:09] saying Mr callus ended up with the gun
[05:01:11] because he seized it from one of the
[05:01:13] other
[05:01:14] guys but hold on if that's what had
[05:01:18] happened then why didn't he share the
[05:01:20] truth with any of us he didn't even want
[05:01:23] to face the orrice machine and chose
[05:01:26] instead to prove his honor in a
[05:01:29] duel maybe he didn't want to explain oh
[05:01:31] okay maybe this obvious but I feel like
[05:01:32] he didn't want to explain cuz then his
[05:01:33] daughter would have been like all faith
[05:01:34] in the courts after seeing about that
[05:01:38] Malo told me her two so guess she not
[05:01:41] going to exp I can understand why he
[05:01:43] committed to the duel I'll tell you
[05:01:45] everything once the whole truth has been
[05:01:47] revealed I understand then I'll leave Mr
[05:01:51] Call's honor in your hands boss and if I
[05:01:54] may just say one more thing the whole
[05:01:57] callus the Unfaithful epithet has been a
[05:02:00] thorn in my side since the day it was
[05:02:02] invented many people have laughed at me
[05:02:04] for still calling him Mr callus even
[05:02:07] after so many years have passed but it
[05:02:10] was Mr Call's trust that allowed me to
[05:02:12] rise through the ranks of spina D
[05:02:14] rasula and live the life I lead today no
[05:02:18] matter what others might say don't worry
[05:02:22] I will you and all our
[05:02:24] other okay we'll go find the truth
[05:02:28] sure have to go talk to [ __ ] Siri
[05:02:30] where is he this guy's a Nar all
[05:02:39] good oh he's right
[05:02:50] here hey tierry it's me TI oh now what
[05:02:55] brings you here miss Navia oh so you've
[05:02:58] got news of that already oh okay hey hey
[05:03:03] I'm also a member of the guards this guy
[05:03:05] talks too slow I'm sorry are you sure
[05:03:06] there isn't a little bit of Truth in
[05:03:08] that under normal circumstances
[05:03:11] shouldn't you have been called back to
[05:03:12] the city
[05:03:14] already I mean where I work is really up
[05:03:17] to me work is really up to me Callis did
[05:03:19] a fantastic job running the town
[05:03:22] building Spina D rasula from the ground
[05:03:24] up and clearing many obstructions in my
[05:03:27] way it would be next to impossible for
[05:03:29] me to find a similarly easy but High
[05:03:32] paying job in the city okay anyway
[05:03:35] enough chitchat are are these two
[05:03:37] friends of yours you uh here for some
[05:03:40] formal business ah yes these two are my
[05:03:43] partners what happened at the Opera
[05:03:45] House made us realize that lenn's case
[05:03:48] and my father's may be related we're
[05:03:51] trying to reinvestigate the details of
[05:03:53] my father's old case ah I get it you
[05:03:57] think there might be more to the case
[05:03:59] now that we know people can be dissolved
[05:04:01] Into Water right
[05:04:03] I
[05:04:04] wased when I first heard of it if you
[05:04:06] want to go through the original files
[05:04:08] from your father's case I can help you
[05:04:10] look for them that would be much
[05:04:12] appreciated thank you actually I have
[05:04:15] another question do you have the
[05:04:18] authority to dispatch gamex of course
[05:04:21] without them I couldn't possibly handle
[05:04:23] Pon on my
[05:04:25] own B I can handle on my own them to
[05:04:29] forcefully get more evidence for your
[05:04:31] father's well you see just recently we
[05:04:34] were attacked by a horde of unnumbered
[05:04:36] gamch in the city
[05:04:39] so if you hypothetically wanted to do
[05:04:42] something against me all you would need
[05:04:45] to do is get rid of the mecca serial
[05:04:46] numbers and send them after
[05:04:51] me then you think too highly of my
[05:04:54] abilities okay dispatching mea is
[05:04:57] very I had to make an analogy when you
[05:05:00] order a dish the chef will make it for
[05:05:03] you you can ask the shf if you try to
[05:05:05] make unreasonable removing a Serial so I
[05:05:08] can promise you those private units I
[05:05:11] skipped the analogy I'm sorry I'm sorry
[05:05:13] I'm sorry cry not cheap so whoever their
[05:05:16] owner is must be super rich powerful or
[05:05:21] both now that you mention it though Zio
[05:05:24] analogies dude my analogies are so much
[05:05:26] better enough to afford this what is X
[05:05:29] right here right meow it's X right here
[05:05:30] right
[05:05:31] meow
[05:05:34] oh my is so much better clear

[05:05:44] now Jokes Aside I'd like to wish you all
[05:05:46] the best with your investigation I'll be
[05:05:48] staying in the city for a little while

[05:06:47] waiting I'm not as young as I used to be
[05:06:50] so my legs are Chad I hear my dad waking
[05:06:52] up uh I'm going to have to sit in a way
[05:06:55] where he can't see me because it is
[05:06:57] currently 5:53
[05:07:01] a.m. and and I don't want to explain if
[05:07:03] I don't have
[05:07:07] to oh it's all right Uncle Marcel
[05:07:10] there's no need to stress I just wanted
[05:07:13] to talk to you briefly about one son I'm
[05:07:16] sure you saw everything too
[05:07:19] right yes I've never seen anything so
[05:07:23] strange oh you were at the opera house
[05:07:26] too that's right I also witnessed your
[05:07:29] marous sleuthing work quite impressive
[05:07:33] okay to beat the hydro archon at her own
[05:07:36] game on her own turf I can already
[05:07:38] imagine everyone in Fontaine discussing
[05:07:40] your exploits over a few glasses of wi
[05:07:43] must be [ __ ]
[05:07:44] pissed oh Pon doesn't want to become the
[05:07:47] talk of
[05:07:49] drunk apologies it's just how Fontaine
[05:07:53] is as a nation everyone loves drama and
[05:07:55] theatric Uncle Marcel you've also
[05:07:57] noticed that other thing right the fact
[05:08:00] that humans can dissolve in water
[05:08:04] I it's not on auto I was like whyn't
[05:08:06] playing I was reminded of your father's
[05:08:08] case right away is that what you're
[05:08:10] investigating now exactly I still don't
[05:08:13] have much solid proof but I can sense
[05:08:16] that the other side has already begun to
[05:08:18] act oh and what makes you say that we
[05:08:22] were attacked on arus by some unnumbered
[05:08:24] gardx and true also an attempt to get me
[05:08:28] to drink water from the primordial
[05:08:29] that's also true if not for the
[05:08:31] vigilance of my part partner I probably
[05:08:33] wouldn't even be here talking to you
[05:08:34] right now oh you're giving us too much
[05:08:38] credit wasn't it you who protected us
[05:08:41] alas it seems things are heating up
[05:08:43] again the peace that callus sought so
[05:08:45] dearly will soon become I'm so [ __ ]
[05:08:48] tired but rest assured Navia I need some
[05:08:51] will always remain a safe haven for you
[05:08:53] if you're scared you can always return
[05:08:55] there if anyone dares to lay their hands

[05:09:01] will use it funds to the last Mora to
[05:09:04] bring them to justice thank you Uncle
[05:09:07] Marcel but I don't intend to go into
[05:09:10] hiding I'm going to strike while the
[05:09:12] Iron's hot okay do you have any new
[05:09:14] thoughts on my father's case about that
[05:09:17] sorry my age is catching up with me you
[05:09:20] don't even look that old to recall my
[05:09:22] memory this guy's sus the confrerie was
[05:09:25] responsible for that banquet so I was
[05:09:27] out and about the whole time the is were
[05:09:30] running smoothly I didn't even have the
[05:09:32] time to drink with the guests then I
[05:09:34] heard the sound of a gunshot and the
[05:09:36] rest was history oh it's okay no need to
[05:09:40] push yourself we'll ask around some more
[05:09:43] see if there are any valuable Clues
[05:09:44] elsewhere sounds good just let me know
[05:09:46] if you ever need morea I need Mora all
[05:09:49] my wealth comes from Call's patronage
[05:09:51] and support bro give us more she's
[05:09:53] literally isn't she broke she just said
[05:09:54] she's
[05:09:55] broke yeah she'll take
[05:10:01] Mora
[05:10:03] can can I have Mora hey man
[05:10:06] Al
[05:10:07] okay never mind I guess SW
[05:10:12] Fury dude I need MOA even [ __ ] Navia
[05:10:15] needs
[05:10:22] MOA useless all three suspects purely
[05:10:26] based on their conversations with me
[05:10:28] none of them sounded particularly
[05:10:31] suspicious
[05:10:32] okay what if it might be one of them
[05:10:34] right it might be one of them right it
[05:10:36] might be one of them right but what if
[05:10:38] no spoiler chat okay you're not allowed
[05:10:40] to type spoilers anti- spoiler spam what
[05:10:43] if it's one of the dudes We Trust what
[05:10:44] if it's like the [ __ ] old dude or
[05:10:46] silver it's probably not silver cuz he's
[05:10:48] too cool a guy with Shades would never
[05:10:49] betray us I suppose I'm not going to
[05:10:51] look at chat cuz if that's true you guys
[05:10:53] are be like sing all that's needed to
[05:10:55] find them out then my father wouldn't
[05:10:57] have needed to investigate the case for
[05:10:59] so many years what if it's like our
[05:11:00] friend anyway even though we didn't make
[05:11:02] a breakthrough let's still compile what
[05:11:04] we were able to
[05:11:06] find but where should we start Jac M ah
[05:11:11] you're right flon mentioned that Palace
[05:11:14] probably only ended up with a gun
[05:11:16] because of
[05:11:18] circumstance that makes sense according
[05:11:21] to jacques's family members he already
[05:11:23] told them that he had been discovered
[05:11:25] and that he had no choice before he left
[05:11:27] home that day okay if I had to guess he
[05:11:31] probably received received an order from
[05:11:32] the synth boss to kill my father had he
[05:11:35] refused he and his family's lives would
[05:11:38] have been forfeit so fired the first
[05:11:41] shot okay just to make sure there are no
[05:11:42] more there are no spoilers in chat so
[05:11:44] that I can actually read my chat uh
[05:11:45] we're quickly going
[05:11:48] [Music]
[05:12:00] to yeah you just got Toyota Cor CH get
[05:12:03] [ __ ] all right back to Eng I'm sorry
[05:12:06] you just got Toyota
[05:12:08] cored uh can he guarantee his safy after
[05:12:11] killing callus could he guarantee his
[05:12:12] family sa after killing callus oh that's
[05:12:15] a good point Jack probably already knew
[05:12:18] that he was just being used as a tool
[05:12:20] for murder and once he had not true so
[05:12:24] what would make more sense from his
[05:12:26] perspective would be to turn his back on
[05:12:28] the order and seek protection from my
[05:12:31] father true makes sense but without
[05:12:34] evidence that's still just a theory a
[05:12:37] game theory thanks for watching do the
[05:12:40] attack from the gardex has been
[05:12:42] bothering me quite a bit as well it's
[05:12:45] obvious that our enemy has become more
[05:12:47] antsy after the secret of the primordial
[05:12:49] seawater was revealed okay do you think
[05:12:52] he knew even then that we'd follow this
[05:12:55] lead to the end given everything that's
[05:12:57] happened since it's quite possible but
[05:13:00] who Navia look like fish ability to
[05:13:04] control privately owned G what does that
[05:13:06] even mean oh [ __ ] uh who could control
[05:13:10] the gavx it was uh [ __ ] it was the
[05:13:13] dude when I was like oh like I skipped
[05:13:14] his analogy it was no whose analogy I
[05:13:17] skip cuz he was like oh the aard was it
[05:13:20] tii or marel I think it was tii it
[05:13:23] wasn't Florence I think it was tii TI
[05:13:25] who say huh it is possible that he's
[05:13:29] figured out a way to convert the gardx
[05:13:31] for but I didn't feel like he was lying
[05:13:34] when he was talking to us about the
[05:13:36] mecca I also don't think he'd be able to
[05:13:38] keep that kind of tampering Under Wraps
[05:13:41] yeah had he actually tempered with the
[05:13:44] mecca we'd be able to prove it with a
[05:13:46] simple check of the guard's inventory
[05:13:48] true maybe if the mecca were taken from
[05:13:50] the guards it should be pretty easy to
[05:13:53] find out when and how that
[05:13:57] happened oh oh his analogy was how he
[05:14:01] couldn't have tempered okay listen at
[05:14:03] least I was right with the guy that
[05:14:05] talked with the max at least I was right
[05:14:07] okay let me think about FL FL was like
[05:14:09] yeah and then Marcel was the dude at the
[05:14:11] end that or like the dude in like that
[05:14:13] had the excess MOA yeah I guess at the
[05:14:14] end and he was
[05:14:17] like Uncle
[05:14:21] Marcel my father did really trust he was
[05:14:24] sauce I did say he was sauce they worked
[05:14:26] together on a large number of projects
[05:14:28] maybe that's how we got to know
[05:14:30] jacqu
[05:14:32] and with funds from the cont he could
[05:14:35] also afford he was rich still really
[05:14:38] hard for me to imagine though after all
[05:14:41] Uncle Marcel has been around since I was
[05:14:42] just a also if it's neither of the three
[05:14:45] then I'm pissed cuz literally why are
[05:14:47] you giving me options to why are you
[05:14:48] making me make a fool on myself man I
[05:14:50] said what if it's one of our friends
[05:14:51] what if the [ __ ] old dude that's
[05:14:52] helping us or the dude of the shades but
[05:14:54] you're like oh be one of the three so
[05:14:56] now I have to go through three [ __ ]
[05:14:57] options it's not going to be
[05:15:00] either it is true he was closest to my
[05:15:02] father no it's not him man as Spina D
[05:15:04] rula's adviser his work mostly deals
[05:15:07] with personnel and security so so you're
[05:15:10] saying he's too broke toam that is
[05:15:13] [ __ ] especially all damn that's a says
[05:15:16] you moment but that's also [ __ ]
[05:15:18] exactly he can't and even if he could I
[05:15:22] don't think he would be able to dispatch
[05:15:23] a whole group so
[05:15:26] quickly that's [ __ ] that
[05:15:29] [ __ ] yeah it's literally one of our
[05:15:35] friends where is
[05:15:38] he wait those are only the three I could
[05:15:40] select okay let's read
[05:15:43] them Florence the adviser to SP rosula
[05:15:46] claimed that he was very graceful to the
[05:15:47] CIS for his kindness he's also present
[05:15:48] at the bank why did I say like that at
[05:15:51] the banket banquet on the day of his
[05:15:53] case and can provide evidence that
[05:15:54] callus did not carry a gun T is the
[05:15:57] person responsible for official contact
[05:16:00] between Spina and guards according to
[05:16:03] him only the sufficiently rich can Pro
[05:16:06] uh own privately large numbers of gxs
[05:16:09] maxel Marcel is the leader of the
[05:16:13] conf that's not how you say it but
[05:16:14] whatever and was the organizer of the
[05:16:17] banquet years prior the Ki and the Spina
[05:16:20] D Rula have always maintained a close
[05:16:22] working relationship those recollection
[05:16:24] events is foggy he's willing to defend
[05:16:27] ofia oh I didn't read the question which
[05:16:29] of these suspects was most likely to
[05:16:30] have committ committed the crime the
[05:16:32] serial disappearances of young
[05:16:36] women this guy has like the the like
[05:16:40] redditor beard no disrespect though
[05:16:52] um I mean this guy was
[05:17:00] rich either the cop or the rich dude in
[05:17:02] my opinion if I'm just were to guess
[05:17:04] from these three cuz all the other
[05:17:05] that'ss
[05:17:11] irrelevant I'm not going to look at chat
[05:17:13] for a second
[05:17:21] uh you know if you think everything
[05:17:25] through let's go Marcel is indeed the
[05:17:28] most suspicious of them all can we be
[05:17:30] missing wasel
[05:17:32] my God my was know about the people tur
[05:17:34] into thing when heared it down to these
[05:17:37] three did he he's like I don't remember
[05:17:39] but I have Mora if you want that's what
[05:17:41] he said just trying to bribe us loose
[05:17:43] has always been very reliable and his
[05:17:46] Judgment of others trustworthiness has
[05:17:48] been Fair he wasn't even old he's like
[05:17:49] 42 acting like he's old the guy was like
[05:17:52] 35 he gave me made a lot of 50 at most
[05:17:56] the suspect is
[05:17:59] knowledgeable has the means to disat to
[05:18:01] assassinate US and possesses significant
[05:18:05] intellect and
[05:18:07] foresight even if I don't want to
[05:18:09] believe it I'm starting to see how
[05:18:11] things could all tie back to Uncle
[05:18:12] Marcel true well we still have another
[05:18:15] trump card on top of all the theorizing
[05:18:17] and speculating yes Malo did say that
[05:18:20] charging straight in there would be
[05:18:21] extremely risky yeah [ __ ] it let's go we
[05:18:23] need far more solid proof before we can
[05:18:26] hope to go charging in on our enemy
[05:18:28] Navia here you are what the I've I've
[05:18:31] been looking for you I found solid proof
[05:18:33] so you can charge into your enemy watch
[05:18:35] the guy from
[05:18:36] the yeah news came from Aras just after
[05:18:40] you left we've got another trial on our
[05:18:42] hands what wasn't that place built
[05:18:44] specifically for holding trials it's
[05:18:47] about you news worthy about this one I
[05:18:49] know I know but they said the person
[05:18:52] they're putting on trial is Harbinger
[05:18:54] called T I forgot Tri in this Quest wait
[05:18:56] I just
[05:18:58] remembered oh [ __ ]
[05:19:02] what is that someone you know yeah we're
[05:19:05] kind of close I mean we know him maybe
[05:19:09] even a little too well well he's been
[05:19:12] accused of being the true culprit behind
[05:19:15] dis appearances case it's absurd don't
[05:19:18] you think wait how none of our
[05:19:22] investigations have had anything to do
[05:19:24] with him that's what I thought was
[05:19:26] strange about it so he's a criminal but
[05:19:28] like the the good kind like like like at
[05:19:30] least looks good it'll be next to he he
[05:19:34] has a brother a twer you know twer
[05:19:38] because they'll think they've already
[05:19:40] found the
[05:19:41] culprit yeah and it'll be a lot harder
[05:19:44] than to clear also yeah he's Mr he's
[05:19:46] [ __ ] Mr worldwide Mr International
[05:19:49] he's [ __ ] pitbull there's no way he's
[05:19:51] he's stealing people from font 10 all

[05:19:54] is going to be a that land [ __ ] he's
[05:19:56] going to be in shz he's going to be in
[05:19:58] [ __ ]
[05:19:59] everywhere um
[05:20:02] huh split up what do you mean you can go
[05:20:06] to Arin yes while I go investigate that
[05:20:09] place I'm confident in my combat
[05:20:12] abilities just as expected of my partner
[05:20:15] since this is a trial about the serial
[05:20:17] disappearances case the culprit
[05:20:20] attention will be focused on aronas
[05:20:22] leaving his home base wide open you're
[05:20:26] right this is our best
[05:20:28] opportunity all right then let's do this
[05:20:32] I won't have any chance of making that
[05:20:34] charge stick though unless we find more
[05:20:36] evidence it'll be up to you to make it
[05:20:39] back in time and hand the decisive
[05:20:41] evidence we'll help you just like you I

[05:21:31] that's a [ __ ] is that a luxurious
[05:21:33] chest what the
[05:21:36] [ __ ] luxurious
[05:21:48] chest wait why did it make me go here
[05:21:51] just to tell me to go here
[05:21:58] okay let's go and try to find the
[05:22:00] entrance
[05:22:02] well let me close some stuff cuz my game
[05:22:03] is like lagging a
[05:22:11] little switch to kakomi sorry so
[05:22:15] true there it is wait I've been in there
[05:22:18] there's [ __ ] Crystal flies there
[05:22:20] finally found or maybe not maybe that's
[05:22:22] a different one so this is the entrance
[05:22:25] that leads to the syn production
[05:22:27] base ah you're right an important place
[05:22:30] like is bound to have a ton of
[05:22:37] prote meanwhile inside the Opera
[05:22:47] epic it would appear that I must repeat
[05:22:49] my question again Mr tart oh [ __ ] sh
[05:22:53] charge that you are the true C the
[05:22:55] serial disappearances
[05:22:57] case to be perfectly honest I don't
[05:23:00] understand your country's complicated
[05:23:02] court system or the reason why I'm being
[05:23:04] charged with something I've never even
[05:23:06] who the [ __ ] accused them however do I
[05:23:08] did hear that people who have been
[05:23:10] charged can choose to participate oh God
[05:23:12] he's going to e stop is that right in
[05:23:15] which case as long as I accept the
[05:23:17] charge I can have an allout fight with
[05:23:20] that champion duelist clarent
[05:23:22] right I've got to admit that's one of
[05:23:25] the most enticing offers I've ever
[05:23:27] received dude he just wants to fight her
[05:23:29] when I privately sparred with her last
[05:23:31] time she was obviously holding back real
[05:23:34] privately sparred sus hey don't you
[05:23:38] understand you're currently the prime
[05:23:41] suspect for a major you wouldn't get it
[05:23:43] don't worry about it just just it's okay
[05:23:45] like don't worry about it for fights oh
[05:23:49] sounds like the hydro archon wants to
[05:23:51] lecture me on fight house then why don't
[05:23:54] he's only using a bow to practice I'm
[05:23:56] the kind of student that learns best In
[05:23:58] the Heat of
[05:23:59] battle
[05:24:02] no no no dude why does Fina talk all
[05:24:03] this [ __ ] but can't
[05:24:07] fight alas it would appear that
[05:24:09] communication with the defendant is
[05:24:11] going poorly we have made very little
[05:24:14] progress in that case let me explain
[05:24:17] everything from the very beginning again
[05:24:19] the goal of this trial is to determine
[05:24:21] the culprit behind the serial
[05:24:22] disappearances case she's a [ __ ]
[05:24:25] keyboard Warrior dude finina online's a
[05:24:28] must be a [ __ ] Menace h what's going
[05:24:31] on you don't want to be in a lobby with
[05:24:33] her she injecting
[05:24:35] again I told you it couldn't be one of
[05:24:37] the fou
[05:24:38] harders Miss NAIA this is the if you
[05:24:41] argue with finina she sends her
[05:24:44] IP you don't want to [ __ ] with finina
[05:24:46] you were able to provide the court with
[05:24:47] a key
[05:24:49] eyewitness but that was an exception
[05:24:51] rather than standard Court protocol I
[05:24:54] can very well charge you with contempt
[05:24:56] of court for your
[05:24:57] interjections oh please did you do you
[05:25:01] ever think I had any respect for this
[05:25:03] place's pointless
[05:25:05] theatrics we can put that discussion
[05:25:07] aside for now I'm not here to argue with
[05:25:10] you I'm here to charge the true culprit
[05:25:12] behind the serial disappearances case
[05:25:15] and if my charges proved true then
[05:25:17] tartaglia here will be proven innocent
[05:25:19] by default
[05:25:22] correct a young lady has charged in an
[05:25:24] offer to clear my name how fascinating
[05:25:28] well I'd gotten half bored to death by
[05:25:30] all these rules Andes anyway so I'll
[05:25:33] take you up on that offer so your honor
[05:25:36] is there nothing else for me to do now
[05:25:39] you may take a seat for now in the
[05:25:40] audience but that doesn't mean the
[05:25:42] suspicions against you have been
[05:25:46] lifted now then miss Navia who is the
[05:25:49] person you would like to charge
[05:25:51] instead that person is
[05:25:55] you
[05:25:59] oh well it's a the person that we said
[05:26:01] was sus right Marcel was it a
[05:26:03] Marcel
[05:26:05] uh yeah I think it's still
[05:26:09] Marcel I mean his name does rhyme with
[05:26:11] parcel the head of con so that already
[05:26:14] is huh what con never heard of them in
[05:26:17] my life I've heard of them but weren't
[05:26:21] they Spina dla's sister organization oh
[05:26:24] is this going to be a friends the
[05:26:25] enemies type situation okay please let
[05:26:28] me remind you miss Navia he
[05:26:31] is an incredibly serious matter
[05:26:33] committing to the charge also means
[05:26:35] taking on the legal responsibilities
[05:26:37] associated with it and if the charge
[05:26:39] fails depending on the circumstances you
[05:26:42] may also be charged with the crime of
[05:26:44] making a false accusation yes I do in
[05:26:48] that case I declare the charge to be
[05:26:50] valid Miss Navia and attorneys please
[05:26:53] take your places on the
[05:26:56] court members of the guards please
[05:26:59] contact beautiful and a dragon so that's
[05:27:02] a double double w one more you get a
[05:27:04] [ __ ] website www. [ __ ] I'm not
[05:27:08] going to say it they get clipped I'll
[05:27:09] behave myself you will not require an
[05:27:11] attorney I'll behave myself I don't want
[05:27:13] to say anything sus in a m outfit so
[05:27:15] we're going to be normal today happen so
[05:27:17] quickly I still haven't figured out
[05:27:19] what's going on I think an attorney
[05:27:21] won't be necessary this is probably just
[05:27:23] a misunderstanding between me Shut the
[05:27:25] the [ __ ] up Marshall very well in that
[05:27:27] case since both sides have now arrived
[05:27:29] Miss Navi please present your charges I
[05:27:32] would like to take everyone back to 3
[05:27:34] years ago to the case of Callis the UN
[05:27:37] no one remembers that case I'm sorry
[05:27:39] Navia I like I love you Navia but nobody
[05:27:41] remembers that in that case can we
[05:27:42] connect all the for the serial
[05:27:44] disappearances case Navia do you really
[05:27:48] think that I was the one who killed your
[05:27:50] father come on why would I do that
[05:27:53] callus was my benefactor and remember
[05:27:55] both you and I only ran to the scene
[05:27:57] when we heard the sound of a gun if
[05:28:00] that's enough to make me a suspect
[05:28:01] wouldn't that make everyone at that
[05:28:02] banquet a suspect as well I uh I think
[05:28:07] there's no point in getting into the
[05:28:09] specifics right now the audience doesn't
[05:28:12] even have the big picture yet even
[05:28:15] I'm struggling to remember some details
[05:28:19] of that case exactly correct your honor
[05:28:23] I must refresh everyone's memory about
[05:28:25] that case before I can explain my charge
[05:28:27] and reasoning I see in in which case I
[05:28:31] will recount the findings about that
[05:28:32] case as originally recorded by maon
[05:28:39] Guardian on the day of the murder Spina
[05:28:42] D rosula hosted a large banquet in a
[05:28:44] Countryside estate owned by the confer
[05:28:46] of
[05:28:50] cabriere
[05:28:52] okay during the banquet all attending
[05:28:55] guests heard two gunshots from the
[05:28:57] courtyard yeah that's true when the
[05:28:59] guests arrived at the scene they found
[05:29:01] the primary suspect callus holding a gun
[05:29:04] while his acquaintance jacqu lay dead
[05:29:06] from a gunshot
[05:29:09] wound the guard's investigation did not
[05:29:12] recover any other firearms from the
[05:29:14] scene as a result they concluded that
[05:29:16] the suspect's first shot must have
[05:29:18] missed while the second must have taken
[05:29:19] Jac's life not true probably two people
[05:29:24] are dead the suspect did not dispute
[05:29:26] this conclusion and also declined to
[05:29:28] defend himself no one misses in a piece
[05:29:29] of f
[05:29:30] he chose to prove his innoc through a
[05:29:41] duel okay callus was defeated by
[05:29:43] Champion duelist cland in the ensuing
[05:29:45] duel and soon succumbed to the
[05:29:49] injuries these are the known facts about
[05:29:52] the
[05:29:56] case honestly you're right I'm sorry now
[05:29:58] that I hear you say it I'm on side again
[05:30:00] not my father and even so shock still
[05:30:04] had no reason to pull the
[05:30:06] trigger in truth the third person shot
[05:30:10] Shock first and was shot in turn by my
[05:30:12] father when my father seized the gun
[05:30:14] from him after that the true culprit
[05:30:17] turned the third person into water
[05:30:19] erasing all traces of him from the
[05:30:22] scene thank you for the summary your
[05:30:25] honor of course the guard's conclusion
[05:30:28] appeared quite sensible to us at the
[05:30:30] time
[05:30:31] however we should revisit the case now
[05:30:33] that we've gained new information about
[05:30:35] the abilities of water from the
[05:30:36] primordial
[05:30:38] sea what the again oh we're refuting
[05:30:43] okay okay what are you wearing I lost a
[05:30:46] bet but if you follow that would be
[05:30:48] appreciated cuz then it's like oh at
[05:30:50] least I got the I'm sorry I'm sorry you
[05:30:52] could also sub no no I'll shut up I'm
[05:30:55] sorry
[05:30:57] out
[05:30:58] okay uh the banquet H SP hosted a large
[05:31:01] banquet in the countryside EST state
[05:31:02] owned by
[05:31:06] the
[05:31:11] um
[05:31:15] okay two
[05:31:17] gunshots it is not
[05:31:20] callus callus did not carry a gun no
[05:31:24] sorry I'll be I'll be smart I'll be
[05:31:25] smart I'll be smart I won't [ __ ] up I
[05:31:26] won't [ __ ] up I promise no more mistakes
[05:31:28] no more mistakes let me think let me
[05:31:30] read let me cook no more mistakes there
[05:31:32] will be zero mistakes let me read no
[05:31:33] mistakes watch I'm going to read ready
[05:31:35] ready
[05:31:36] okay um the guard inv not recover any
[05:31:39] other firearms from the scene as a
[05:31:40] result the first shot must have missed
[05:31:41] and the second must have taken Jack's
[05:31:45] life
[05:31:47] [Music]
[05:31:48] H uh can we the only one person who can
[05:31:51] have a large amount of
[05:31:54] guardx that he had struggled greatly
[05:31:57] with the order to kill
[05:31:59] callice
[05:32:06] I could mention that here because there
[05:32:07] could be like a little bit of a yes sir
[05:32:10] okay in the end he reconsidered and
[05:32:13] instead shared everything with callus
[05:32:16] hoping to sa the ladder's protection if
[05:32:18] we don't count the first guess we're one
[05:32:19] and0 the true culprit had already
[05:32:21] considered this possibility and had want
[05:32:24] to know if we don't count the first
[05:32:27] one
[05:32:29] okay
[05:32:30] uh scene of the
[05:32:33] crime that callus did not bring a gun
[05:32:35] with him moreover that's a nice word
[05:32:37] details of the case Point towards the
[05:32:39] existence of a third
[05:32:44] party Marcel clothing of an unknown
[05:32:48] person oo clothing of an unknown person
[05:32:51] this assassin first shot shck then turn
[05:32:54] to shoot Callis only for callus to
[05:32:56] wrestle the gun from him and kill him
[05:32:58] instead
[05:33:01] reconstruction of events as a result
[05:33:05] they concluded that the suspect's first
[05:33:06] shot must have missed and the second one
[05:33:09] must have taken Jack's life no no
[05:33:14] no call didn't even have a
[05:33:18] gun could be this too no no the solve is
[05:33:20] for this uh wait no never
[05:33:25] mind he didn't even have a gun you're
[05:33:28] on
[05:33:33] someone was dissolved someone was
[05:33:35] dissolved someone was dissolved someone
[05:33:37] was dissolved sound at the scene the
[05:33:39] guards once believed they were used by
[05:33:41] jacqu as a costume to disguise himself
[05:33:43] but now it is clear that the clothes
[05:33:45] were proof that there was a third person
[05:33:47] at the scene and that they were turned
[05:33:49] into water after committing the murder
[05:33:52] since it was raining that day the
[05:33:54] culprit was confident that they could
[05:33:55] use the rain to wash away all traces of
[05:33:57] their dissolved accomplice
[05:34:00] she not even bad not even bad culprit
[05:34:03] caused the hired assassin to dissolve
[05:34:05] into water leading everyone to believe
[05:34:08] Callis was responsible for jacques's
[05:34:12] murder
[05:34:15] true true successful
[05:34:24] reputation ah so that's what happened
[05:34:27] wait you're telling me something is
[05:34:29] dangerous is what a great Theory it also
[05:34:32] explains calluses and jacques's
[05:34:34] respective motives it literally calls
[05:34:36] you guilty shoot each other after all Mr
[05:34:38] Marcel you are the one being charged
[05:34:40] with the crime you should provide a what
[05:34:43] a great Theory ah but I think I agree
[05:34:47] with everything Navia just said in fact
[05:34:49] there was nothing in Her speech that
[05:34:50] directly implicated me then may I ask
[05:34:54] some questions in my opinion of need to
[05:34:58] determine two thing one do you have the
[05:35:02] evidence to back up your
[05:35:05] claims I'm afraid not at least not at
[05:35:09] this very moment
[05:35:11] boo if you don't have any evidence who
[05:35:14] are you you don't have a name I may not
[05:35:17] have the evidence with me but I know
[05:35:18] where I could go to your [ __ ] yellow
[05:35:20] bracelet thing doesn't even the necklace
[05:35:22] thing doesn't even match your outfit go
[05:35:23] change W missing around the same
[05:35:26] time to find a match considering theal
[05:35:29] disappearances case the guards probably
[05:35:32] kept careful records of all missing
[05:35:34] persons from around that time regardless
[05:35:36] of age or gender that makes sense to me
[05:35:40] missalette I would consider this to be a
[05:35:43] reasonable investigative
[05:35:46] Direction huh why do I feel like finina
[05:35:49] is acting a little differently today
[05:35:52] maybe she's scared of embarrassing
[05:35:53] herself again true alternatively she's
[05:35:56] become more diligent after charging an
[05:35:58] innocent citizen the last she learned my
[05:36:02] question has to do with the ensuing duel
[05:36:05] if the truth is indeed as you
[05:36:08] described then why didn't Mr Callis
[05:36:11] explain himself in court if he had
[05:36:15] testified that a person had been
[05:36:17] dissolved he could have at least mounted
[05:36:19] a defense I thought about this too and
[05:36:23] the answer is actually pretty simple he
[05:36:26] felt there were things that were more
[05:36:28] important to him the dissolving power of
[05:36:31] water from the primordial sea is an
[05:36:33] important secret for the true culprit of
[05:36:35] the serial disappearances case true my
[05:36:37] father could have exposed it for all to
[05:36:39] see but he chose to take it to the grave
[05:36:42] at that Spina D rosula was in Dire
[05:36:45] Straits and his reputation had already
[05:36:48] been shattered he had no guarantee that
[05:36:50] going forward with the truth would allow
[05:36:52] the culprit to be brought to Justice
[05:36:55] what was certain however was that it
[05:36:57] would paint a gigantic Target on my back
[05:37:00] boss once told me that demoiselle had
[05:37:03] already been selected as the next Target
[05:37:05] of the serial disappearance this guy
[05:37:07] helpful what no if the secret had gotten
[05:37:11] out the culprit would have fought an
[05:37:13] allout war with aena right there and
[05:37:15] then I wouldn't have been the only one
[05:37:17] in danger all of us would have stood to
[05:37:19] lose our lives of course the guards
[05:37:22] might eventually figure out the truth of
[05:37:24] the matter and determine that we were in
[05:37:26] the right but what good would that do do
[05:37:30] how can a hollow verdict protect anyone
[05:37:33] had this opera house ever given my
[05:37:35] father any kind of confidence in its
[05:37:38] brand of Justice Spina dula dude even if
[05:37:40] we manage to prove child's innocence
[05:37:42] he's going to be pissed he just wants to
[05:37:43] fight by staying silent fight we retain
[05:37:45] the ability to deter our opponents and
[05:37:47] continue the sailmate I was able to
[05:37:50] become spad D rula's president which
[05:37:52] made me harder to Target as well as
[05:37:54] giving me more time to grow and learn
[05:37:57] and once I have figured out the truth
[05:37:59] and stepped up to the challenge I will
[05:38:01] do what this Opera House cannot and
[05:38:04] restore my father's truth and honor back
[05:38:07] to him so you mean to say your father
[05:38:12] intended to die in the Duelist ring yes
[05:38:15] that's
[05:38:17] right do you have any proof no of course
[05:38:21] oh okay all you need is to ask his
[05:38:24] opponent
[05:38:26] cland damn he's dragging her into this I
[05:38:29] don't don't need your apology your guilt
[05:38:31] or your support from the Shadows you
[05:38:34] don't have to do anything for my sake
[05:38:36] but since he entrusted his will to you
[05:38:39] cland you should tell us the truth about
[05:38:41] his
[05:38:42] sacrifice um so during the duel did you
[05:38:46] believe that callus was intending to die
[05:38:49] I need to pull for every character in
[05:38:50] this
[05:38:52] courtroom yes I did as a champion
[05:38:55] duelist I fought many battles and taken
[05:38:58] a countless number number of Dishonored
[05:39:00] lives in my line of work I've seen all
[05:39:04] kinds of people give their all for the
[05:39:06] faintest hope to continue
[05:39:07] living some were determined others
[05:39:11] passionate and some even Manic and
[05:39:14] twisted Just One Look and I can tell if
[05:39:17] a duelist is hoping to live or if
[05:39:18] they're looking to die I hereby swear on
[05:39:22] my name and honor as a champion duelist
[05:39:25] that Mr callus never intended to leave
[05:39:27] the ring alive
[05:39:30] oh sad since that's your testimony I
[05:39:34] have no more questions it appears there
[05:39:36] really are good grounds to reopen this
[05:39:39] case I concur however you still have not
[05:39:43] explained the link between your father's
[05:39:45] case and the serial disappearances case
[05:39:48] right what she said was fascinating but
[05:39:51] kind of beside the point wait weren't
[05:39:53] they just talking about the serial
[05:39:55] disappearances case what are why are you
[05:39:57] listening to these NPCs man are
[05:39:59] connected via a matter of
[05:40:02] timing in my father's case the culprit
[05:40:06] intended to kill bulljack and callus as
[05:40:09] a result they planned to act after
[05:40:11] hearing two
[05:40:12] gunshots and at the end of Lenny's trial
[05:40:16] the culprit also only dissolved the
[05:40:18] victim in front of everyone because they
[05:40:20] realized they were at risk of being
[05:40:22] identified the culprit could only time
[05:40:25] their action so precisely if they were
[05:40:27] already at the scene
[05:40:30] coincidentally Marcel attended that is
[05:40:33] suspicious Marcel that is hey that is a
[05:40:36] little so that's why you suspected
[05:40:39] me even after hearing your reasoning I
[05:40:42] still can't help but find it a little
[05:40:44] Preposterous I'm used to it though
[05:40:46] you've always been an impulsive and
[05:40:48] sentimental child Navia it's one of your
[05:40:50] most endearing traits shut the [ __ ] up
[05:40:52] Marcel no need to appeal to
[05:40:55] posos I won't try to refute your points
[05:40:57] one by one but even if everything you
[05:40:59] just said was true can you prove that I
[05:41:02] was the only person present at both
[05:41:05] events on top of that does a person have
[05:41:08] to be physically present to control the
[05:41:10] timing can't someone remotely monitor
[05:41:12] the
[05:41:17] place know what she can say to that I
[05:41:20] know that even with that you might still
[05:41:22] think you can reduce the list of
[05:41:24] suspects with some further
[05:41:25] investigations until I'm the only one
[05:41:28] left on the list
[05:41:29] alas who won't feel at least a little
[05:41:32] hurt by an accusation of murder from a
[05:41:34] girl you see as your own daughter but if
[05:41:36] I were to dismiss this completely you'd
[05:41:39] also think I'm not being considerate of
[05:41:40] your feelings ah well let Uncle Marcel
[05:41:44] teach you another lesson do you know
[05:41:46] what the biggest flaw in your reasoning
[05:41:48] is oh [ __ ] he's cooking a little I
[05:41:49] suppose you're going to tell me anyways
[05:41:51] it's timing again I'm a businessman by
[05:41:54] trade from that standpoint there's no
[05:41:56] reason for me to kidnap young women it's
[05:41:59] a highrisk action with nothing to gain
[05:42:02] in addition I Left My Home In snea when
[05:42:04] I was young to come to Pon and work in
[05:42:07] some trade my business only thrived when
[05:42:09] I received Call's PTI maybe he's not
[05:42:11] cooking actually but the disappearances
[05:42:13] began before I ever stepped foot in
[05:42:17] Fontaine I do apologize demoiselle this
[05:42:20] was my
[05:42:22] mistake no it's not your fault I'm sure
[05:42:26] he had come prepared is there anything
[05:42:28] else you'd like like to say would you
[05:42:30] like to check the date of my first
[05:42:32] business license against the first known
[05:42:34] case of the serial
[05:42:36] disappearances you can also take a look
[05:42:38] at my border entry records what if it
[05:42:40] started with someone else and then he
[05:42:41] picked it up when I lefta for the first
[05:42:43] time could those records and testimonies
[05:42:46] do something to appease the Unspeakable
[05:42:48] anguish in your heart seems like she got
[05:42:51] the wrong guy at this rate Navia will be
[05:42:55] convicted for falsely accusing him he
[05:42:57] seems a little too prepared of
[05:42:59] dissecting your father's feelings it
[05:43:01] seems like it seems like it seems like
[05:43:02] you're like he sus and then he overly
[05:43:03] explains everything and then you execute
[05:43:05] him anyways and then he was the Imposter
[05:43:07] and then he's like yeah but you didn't
[05:43:08] know why I like I don't care you're dead
[05:43:09] and then minus one impostor and then you
[05:43:11] still win he wished for you to become
[05:43:13] more rational collected and
[05:43:15] conscientious instead of dwelling only
[05:43:17] on your own
[05:43:19] feelings once you've learned to be more
[05:43:22] considerate of others feelings and to
[05:43:23] stop rushing headlong into things you'd
[05:43:26] have met most of his expectations dude
[05:43:28] what are you talking about this isn't
[05:43:30] just your name rhymes with parcel and
[05:43:31] you're pissed about it that's not my
[05:43:33] fault the biggest difference between me
[05:43:35] and the rest of the victims is that I
[05:43:38] still have the ability to search for the
[05:43:39] truth while that same agency has long
[05:43:43] been taken from then the people whose
[05:43:45] families were destroyed by synth abuse
[05:43:47] the people who lost their loved ones to
[05:43:49] the serial disappearances and the people
[05:43:51] who suffered tragic ends due to their
[05:43:53] sense of justice many people's images
[05:43:56] are flashing before my eyes
[05:44:00] I'm sure some are coming to those of you
[05:44:02] in the audience as well and whose image
[05:44:05] do you see Marcel is it a man named Vash
[05:44:11] Vash oh so you do know that name I've
[05:44:16] merely surprised you'd suddenly say the
[05:44:18] name of someone I've never even heard of
[05:44:22] I was waiting for you to say that
[05:44:24] because I saw you kissing him oh never
[05:44:26] mind oh oh oh oh we she cooked she
[05:44:31] cooked she
[05:44:35] cooked wait uh
[05:44:41] is why am
[05:44:47] I but I'm in a domain
[05:44:50] okay I don't know I thought maybe I
[05:44:52] could I don't know I don't I I don't
[05:44:54] know I don't know I don't know I'm sorry
[05:44:55] I'm sorry I got confused I
[05:44:57] panicked

[05:50:46] and find some evidence so we can get
[05:50:48] back to the opera

[05:51:29] uh okay cool Final
[05:51:39] stop M what's this over here M looks
[05:51:43] like some experiment number 16 aims to
[05:51:46] verify Jacob research conclusions on the
[05:51:49] experiment was a failure no individual
[05:51:53] manag to resurface from the water from
[05:51:55] the primordial
[05:51:56] sea f speci 22 23 and 24 were dis Mak me
[05:52:03] so [ __ ]
[05:52:05] itchy what sorry traveler Pon will try
[05:52:09] her best it's just that P's never read
[05:52:14] something so scary before how could
[05:52:16] someone write something that terrible in
[05:52:19] such a matter of fact tongue you read
[05:52:21] the rest P's too scared to keep
[05:52:25] going the goal of the researcher is to
[05:52:27] save uh his
[05:52:31] love wait a
[05:52:35] second
[05:52:48] you're you're telling
[05:52:51] me the goal of the researcher is to save
[05:52:54] his lover a woman called Vig Vig Who was
[05:52:57] the
[05:52:59] no way it's him that's why he did all of
[05:53:02] these experiments but did he really
[05:53:05] think he'd be able to just by dissolving
[05:53:07] people over and over that's just
[05:53:12] insane it was [ __ ] vasher the whole
[05:53:15] time huh isn't that the name you heard
[05:53:18] by the fountain Pon thought he was an
[05:53:21] eyewitness in the serial disappearances
[05:53:26] case no he is is the researcher you mean
[05:53:30] V is the one who did all of
[05:53:33] these
[05:53:35] experiments that is dude he could not
[05:53:38] move on what the [ __ ]
[05:53:42] bro the girl just like her wish was like
[05:53:45] I just hoped he moved on and then the
[05:53:47] dude was literally okay
[05:53:50] well that is unfortunate that's it was
[05:53:54] no victim but personally took his lover
[05:53:57] and
[05:54:00] oh he killed her too not either wait no
[05:54:03] I don't think he killed I think he he
[05:54:05] killed everyone except her right in any
[05:54:07] case P will write it all down I don't
[05:54:10] know why P said
[05:54:18] that damn that is
[05:54:22] [ __ ] D the last time there's like a
[05:54:24] researcher like that it was [ __ ] the
[05:54:26] tanar quest and it was just like a we
[05:54:28] got a cute robot and then the robot was
[05:54:29] you know it was cool meanwhile
[05:54:32] this that must be water from the
[05:54:34] primordial sea that means this is where
[05:54:37] they make all the scent and that special
[05:54:39] water is the main
[05:54:41] ingredient if you dilute it with normal
[05:54:44] water you'll get sense but the pure
[05:54:46] stuff can dissolve the human apprciate P
[05:54:49] will take notes on this incriminating
[05:54:53] evidence
[05:54:55] damn damn that is [ __ ]
[05:55:04] let's see
[05:55:06] what
[05:55:07] Callis nav's
[05:55:10] father oh this seems to be an
[05:55:12] investigation report on
[05:55:18] him yep it's about finding someone to
[05:55:21] assassinate Jac and callus because of a
[05:55:23] lack of confidence that Jac himself
[05:55:25] would go through with it this should
[05:55:27] prove the existence of the third person
[05:55:29] right
[05:55:32] yep we still have not determined the
[05:55:35] exact content of the key information
[05:55:37] callus has passed on to certain me the
[05:55:39] old dog's a real menace to deal with
[05:55:42] even if he abides by the promise he's
[05:55:44] made to us he will still have the upper
[05:55:47] hand he can act whenever he wants to
[05:55:50] make our lives miserable I concur let's
[05:55:53] sayone to kill him he won't declare for
[05:55:58] as long as we don't touch Navia oh seems
[05:56:01] like we've got a bunch of correspondents
[05:56:03] between the
[05:56:09] hups
[05:56:18] okay wait did I do this no I
[05:56:22] didn't
[05:56:24] wa there's so much syn here and so many
[05:56:28] bottles of ingredients that probably
[05:56:30] Justus 35k dude there's been like three
[05:56:33] ad RS I didn't do any of
[05:56:36] them we could do one but listen I'm not
[05:56:40] trying to scam I just don't want to run
[05:56:42] out okay we'll do one we'll do one we'll
[05:56:45] do one but you can dodge it by subbing
[05:56:48] or you can just you can just write a
[05:56:49] short story on what your ad was and I'll
[05:56:50] be like oh cool thanks for I'm sorry
[05:56:52] it's just one it's just one I'm sorry
[05:56:54] it's I'm not going to scam people yep
[05:56:57] it's fruit flavored
[05:57:00] synnth
[05:57:03] cool we've looked at almost everything
[05:57:05] here and it seems like our theories were
[05:57:07] spot on but Vash is Marcel yeah we
[05:57:12] haven't found anything that reveals his
[05:57:14] true identity no wonder even nalette
[05:57:17] wasn't able to find anything whoever it
[05:57:20] is probably destroyed everything do just
[05:57:22] be a friend we'll see that way even if
[05:57:25] we bring all this back to the Opera we w
[05:57:27] be able to identify the true culprit
[05:57:30] sure thing
[05:57:32] P let's keep looking yeah I don't know
[05:57:35] why this is black it's kind of a Mona I
[05:57:37] mean I guess cuz it's like poison but
[05:57:39] still
[05:57:41] Mona oh we can examine the pool
[05:57:43] again never mind there's just no check
[05:57:46] mark on it so I was
[05:57:47] like did I do this yeah I
[05:57:56] did I did that already yeah oh this
[05:58:01] thing I already did
[05:58:04] that what about over here
[05:58:07] maybe no I just did bottles the [ __ ] I
[05:58:10] already did all
[05:58:12] this
[05:58:16] um I did this when I entered okay I have
[05:58:19] to do it again I guess you take that
[05:58:20] side and P will take this I guess
[05:58:22] there's more [ __ ]
[05:58:26] whatever
[05:58:29] nothing at all and P can't even find
[05:58:32] snacks either UK University ad crying
[05:58:35] laughing emoji who really let Pon
[05:58:41] see
[05:58:43] VG isn't that F's lover's
[05:58:47] name then you found her diary uhoh she's
[05:58:51] going to name drop Marcel a it's just a
[05:58:55] normal diet take a look wait that's is
[05:58:57] done she was so sweet
[05:59:02] too so many a whole page is worth but
[05:59:07] the final name she decided on was
[05:59:11] Marcel wait but Marcel's pretty
[05:59:15] old has this case been going on for so
[05:59:18] long that he's F and viger's grown
[05:59:23] son
[05:59:26] what
[05:59:30] hey wait then why are we charging him if
[05:59:33] it's just his son like isn't his dad the
[05:59:36] criminal I maybe he's helping I don't
[05:59:38] know
[05:59:41] but I mean I guess we
[05:59:44] cooked and whose image do you see Marcel
[05:59:48] is it a man named
[05:59:52] Vash oh so you do know that name he is
[05:59:55] very old though so maybe it is him
[05:59:58] you'd suddenly maybe just changed his
[05:59:59] name to what he wanted the son to be cuz
[06:00:01] the wife died before she could give
[06:00:03] birth we're
[06:00:05] back as expected of my partner I just
[06:00:08] knew you'd return in the just how often
[06:00:11] do you intend to fight I mean he's old
[06:00:12] as [ __ ] there's no way that's the son of
[06:00:14] a like yeah there's no way so it has to
[06:00:16] be him given their confidence I expect
[06:00:19] they've found the crucial
[06:00:23] evidence you said you've never heard of
[06:00:26] vasher
[06:00:31] however uh I mean this is the most
[06:00:33] important one but I don't know
[06:00:37] if let me I
[06:00:41] guess but the truth of it Marcel let me
[06:00:45] talking always been
[06:00:48] V huh huh we've investigated your lair
[06:00:53] we already know everything after your
[06:00:56] lover VG was you kept abducting young
[06:00:59] women to experiment on the hopes of
[06:01:01] bringing her back to you you even
[06:01:03] created Marcel as a new identity and
[06:01:06] destroyed all records of your past as V
[06:01:09] so that's it even the villains in Opera
[06:01:13] performances rarely go that far and with
[06:01:17] that Marcel's motive has now been
[06:01:20] established this information regarding
[06:01:22] your past also dismantles your prior
[06:01:25] timing defense well Marcel do you know
[06:01:29] where you went
[06:01:30] wrong you fixated your gate on the L
[06:01:34] that passed away instead of paying
[06:01:36] attention to the living people around
[06:01:37] you so you never noticed how we changed
[06:01:41] or how we grew as individuals you also
[06:01:44] never understood boss's real
[06:01:46] expectations for his daughter for our
[06:01:49] determination to see things
[06:01:52] through your
[06:01:56] determination
[06:01:57] Mr Marcel please speak up now if you
[06:02:00] would like to defend yourself otherwise
[06:02:02] the trial will move on to the next stage
[06:02:05] do you think do you really think I
[06:02:08] wanted to do any of this no one cares no
[06:02:10] one asked plus r Bozo pay attention to
[06:02:13] you what for plus no [ __ ] paid
[06:02:16] attention to me ever empathized with my
[06:02:19] pain ever known how it feels to watch
[06:02:21] the love of your life to no wife no kids
[06:02:26] no one help no friends
[06:02:27] no one even believed me all those
[06:02:30] decades ago even the officers from the
[06:02:33] mardan were laughing at me they said
[06:02:36] there's no way a human being can turn
[06:02:38] into water so I must have gone mad from
[06:02:41] grief viney's death was brushed Away by
[06:02:44] all of you as if it didn't matter at all
[06:02:47] well now you know don't
[06:02:51] you well it's too late now all those who
[06:02:55] were dissolved are gone for forever you
[06:02:58] only have yourselves to blame you set up
[06:03:01] this ornate Opera House in pursuit of
[06:03:03] your so-called Justice your beloved
[06:03:07] drama while turning a blind eye to the
[06:03:10] suffering of the people vigir is dead we
[06:03:14] promised each other that we would always
[06:03:16] be
[06:03:17] together wherever she goes I will
[06:03:21] follow but I'm not from this blasted
[06:03:24] place so I can't be dissolved
[06:03:28] no matter what I
[06:03:29] do dude does this even make sense
[06:03:33] like hey is that water from the
[06:03:36] primordial buff I don't know D doesn't
[06:03:38] make sense if you're okay if it's like
[06:03:40] okay okay I watched like Dracula right
[06:03:42] and he was like he was insane but he was
[06:03:44] like I warned them like my wife cared
[06:03:46] about the humans then they killed her so
[06:03:48] I'm going to kill all the humans it's
[06:03:49] like it's [ __ ] up but it's like okay
[06:03:51] you're grieving your wife I get it this
[06:03:53] guy's literally just like I liked her
[06:03:54] she died now I'm killing innocent women
[06:03:57] what the [ __ ] is wrong with that's not
[06:03:59] even I mean both are bad but this is
[06:04:01] what are you doing you're not even cool
[06:04:02] as a villain you're just a dumbass I
[06:04:04] can't dissolve what is wrong with you
[06:04:07] can't do you all see I can't go I can't
[06:04:11] follow yeah she didn't even die she's a
[06:04:12] [ __ ] ocean is what choice do I have
[06:04:15] but to try to bring her I guess he
[06:04:16] doesn't know that but still I did all of
[06:04:18] that trying to bring her back yeah but
[06:04:20] that a cursed callus still got the
[06:04:22] better of
[06:04:24] me I spent my entire life living on pins
[06:04:28] and needles only to get stabbed by his
[06:04:31] idiot daughter at the very
[06:04:35] end the suspect is exhibiting signs of
[06:04:38] mental distress guards please restrain
[06:04:41] him don't touch me don't anybody come
[06:04:44] near me I still need to save vigier her
[06:04:48] promise we made a promise VG
[06:04:53] Viger please VG don't think badly of me
[06:04:59] at this point the verdict of this trial
[06:05:01] is clear with Mr Marcel's conviction the
[06:05:04] charges Mr tartaglia no longer have any
[06:05:07] basis D fine by me I was in a bad mood
[06:05:11] but after a show like that I'm actually
[06:05:14] fight traveler please submit all the
[06:05:17] evidence you have collected to the
[06:05:18] guards so that I might review and
[06:05:20] summarize the truth behind the serial
[06:05:22] disappearances
[06:05:26] case the man now known as Marcel was
[06:05:28] originally named V and worked as an
[06:05:31] adventurer with his partner and lover
[06:05:33] vigier during an underwater Expedition
[06:05:36] vigier accidentally came into contact
[06:05:38] with water from the primordial sea and
[06:05:41] was dissolved in front of as a result V
[06:05:44] learned of the primordial Waters
[06:05:46] existence through the work of others and
[06:05:48] began to kidnap young women for research
[06:05:51] with the goal of discovering a method to
[06:05:53] restore Viger back to life to cover his
[06:05:56] tracks he invented the new Alias of
[06:05:59] Marcel and began to operate a business
[06:06:01] in
[06:06:04] Pon okay during the course of his
[06:06:08] research B discovered that a diluted
[06:06:10] concoction of water from the primordial
[06:06:12] sea can induce feelings of euphoria and
[06:06:15] began to manufacture and Market synth
[06:06:19] however as he accumulated wealth to fund
[06:06:21] his continued research and expanded the
[06:06:23] scope wait what she dissolved from
[06:06:25] putting her hand in water but drinking a
[06:06:27] little bit of it fine I mean I know it's
[06:06:29] diluted but there's no way she like
[06:06:32] jumped into the sea like no way his wife
[06:06:34] just jumped in it didn't he she dissolve
[06:06:36] from just like I don't know
[06:06:40] whatever how did it dissolve her whole
[06:06:42] body she touched it yeah but wouldn't it
[06:06:44] like dissolve her hand it just killed
[06:06:45] all dissolved all of
[06:06:48] her I guess but if it's that strong how
[06:06:52] can you even dissolve any of it I guess
[06:06:54] you put like a millimeter liter after
[06:06:57] exchanging blows with for many years V
[06:07:01] decided to assassinate their president C
[06:07:04] banquet although the assassination did
[06:07:06] not go as Vash expected he was able to
[06:07:09] turn callus into the murder suspect by
[06:07:12] dissolving the Assassin he sent to the
[06:07:14] scene and just recently vay attempted to
[06:07:17] frame Linny as the culprit of the serial
[06:07:20] disappear case using a similar method
[06:07:23] however his attempt to frame Linny

[06:10:20] over
[06:10:21] with through evidence presented in the
[06:10:24] public trial that was just held it has
[06:10:26] been establish that Mr toaga has no
[06:10:28] direct connection to the serial
[06:10:30] disappearances case however the guilty
[06:10:32] party has been identified and thus it is
[06:10:34] logical to suppose Mr taglia is innoc
[06:10:37] taga Is Not Innocent of any charge but
[06:10:39] all good we now turn to the orrice

[06:11:14] Chief Justice I mean have you ever heard
[06:11:17] of an innocent foule Harbinger do you
[06:11:20] think the orrice might have just

[06:11:24] weren't the charges about the serial
[06:11:26] disappearance case no matter what else
[06:11:28] he's guilty of it shouldn't affect the
[06:11:30] verdict in this Cas right true W

[06:13:29] first time I've encountered such a
[06:13:31] situation however according to the rules
[06:13:34] established at the conception of
[06:13:35] fontaine's court system the orrice
[06:13:38] judgment is the final verdict of the
[06:13:40] court all I do is follow Court procedure
[06:13:43] as for why the orrice arrived at the
[06:13:44] conclusion it did you should probably
[06:13:47] ask someone more knowledgeable uh I mean
[06:13:49] that was kind of sick but what the [ __ ]
[06:13:52] surely you can let him go [ __ ] the
[06:13:53] machine why are you looking at me
[06:13:56] I had nothing to do with it I I don't

[06:14:03] staring at me what does lady finina mean
[06:14:06] by that she says she has no idea either
[06:14:10] but that's impossible finina yeah so are
[06:14:13] the verdicts reliable or not she's
[06:14:15] getting ratioed right now her ego can't
[06:14:17] handle it she's losing followers my
[06:14:20] dearest citizen she's going to make a
[06:14:21] YouTuber apology do you really think
[06:14:23] we'd allow an incorrect verdict to be
[06:14:26] the [ __ ]
[06:14:27] ukulele did you really believe that the
[06:14:30] Judgment could be mistaken or be the
[06:14:33] result of some sort of random mishap
[06:14:36] don't tell me you thought even I had
[06:14:39] been blindsided by the Orr's result but
[06:14:42] the way she looked just now it was
[06:14:44] pretty obvious she had no idea she knows
[06:14:47] knows however given the state of things
[06:14:50] I shall give you an explanation okay
[06:14:52] we're listening everything that just
[06:14:54] took place in including my supposed
[06:14:57] shock and Battlement was a part of an
[06:15:01] elaborate performance with every action
[06:15:04] to stir up drama okay it was just drama
[06:15:06] you're just drama farming I get it it
[06:15:07] was a prank it's a okay I got it of
[06:15:10] course for every performance there is a
[06:15:13] script everything has unfolded exactly
[06:15:16] as I expected from the very beginning as
[06:15:20] the embod of the very she just
[06:15:22] gaslighting us dude the orries shall
[06:15:25] never render an arbitrary judgment okay
[06:15:29] if you thought child had nothing to do
[06:15:31] with a Serial disappearances case it is
[06:15:34] only because you've been blinded by The
[06:15:36] Superficial appearance of
[06:15:39] innocence of course he was actually Vash
[06:15:41] Vash the whole time not to mention the
[06:15:43] danger he poses are Beyond ordinary
[06:15:46] comprehension and completely
[06:15:49] unforgivable all shall be revealed she's
[06:15:53] insane you will come to understand my
[06:15:56] Noble intentions as well as the absolute
[06:16:00] correctness of the orc's
[06:16:06] verdict okay true we're just all wrong
[06:16:09] now having said that although I hate to
[06:16:13] leave things hanging in suspense it is
[06:16:16] now time for this performance to end as
[06:16:19] the lead actress I shall be the first to
[06:16:22] take my leave to so she chose to make
[06:16:26] make her Escape after all did she what

[06:16:30] saying we shouldn't put much stock into
[06:16:32] what I actually can't she probably just
[06:16:35] put on that performance to save face as
[06:16:38] for the truth it's unlikely that yeah

[06:29:08] time since we've been able to Rel well

[06:29:13] going to happen when I woke up in such a
[06:29:15] good mood today yeah the the dude that

[06:29:25] but hey n i mean he's committed a few
[06:29:28] war crimes but not here
[06:29:31] so now that I believe I'm easy to work
[06:29:34] with and always bring home the bacon who
[06:29:37] wouldn't treasure having a partner like
[06:29:40] me sounds like you're really enjoying
[06:29:42] life these days Navia what have you with
[06:29:45] since the trial it's just after I've
[06:29:50] been making non-stop trips between p and
[06:29:52] the courtz
[06:29:53] anden everyone from SP rosula organized
[06:29:57] a memorial for my father we never held a
[06:30:00] memorial when he first died since
[06:30:02] everyone knew that even if we held back
[06:30:04] then oh they're going to hold on now
[06:30:05] that's aome this time though everyone in
[06:30:08] P oh they did even many people from the
[06:30:10] court all attended
[06:30:12] awesome it's been the dearest wish of
[06:30:15] demoiselle all
[06:30:17] along that blasted stubborn fool I was
[06:30:21] right to put my faith in him oh by the
[06:30:25] way I ran into Charlotte just after I
[06:30:27] left the memorial
[06:30:29] service well maybe it'd be more accurate
[06:30:32] to say I knew she would be there and
[06:30:34] there was no way that's actually funny
[06:30:36] though we meet [ __ ] we arrive in font
[06:30:38] charlott's like yeah there's this huge
[06:30:40] case it's been going on for like 20
[06:30:41] years I want to solve literally like 2
[06:30:43] days later we just solve
[06:30:45] it like it's like her life goal we just
[06:30:48] solve it it's like a day thanks Navia
[06:30:51] huh so you know sh to oh wait we just
[06:30:54] met the [ __ ] journalist from the steam
[06:30:57] yeah way back when I first became the
[06:30:59] president of the spad rosula she was all
[06:31:02] over me wouldn't take no for an answer I
[06:31:05] believe the story was called The True
[06:31:08] Heart of Darkness secret tales of the
[06:31:11] Yellow Rose H to be fair though it was a
[06:31:14] really flattering
[06:31:16] feature so we've been on pretty good
[06:31:19] terms ever since okay she was trying to
[06:31:21] lean on our friendship to get me to do
[06:31:23] an exclusive piece on this serial
[06:31:25] disappearance this case yeah come on man
[06:31:27] she wants to do it oh yeah she told us
[06:31:29] about that she's always been super
[06:31:31] interested in that is not out chat her
[06:31:34] wish has finally come true too anyway I
[06:31:36] told her to make sure that when she
[06:31:38] writes about you guys entering the opera
[06:31:39] house with the critical evidence that
[06:31:41] you both sound really
[06:31:44] cool now that's another thing to look
[06:31:47] forward to We Trust Charlotte's skills
[06:31:49] with a pen for sure oh and in other news
[06:31:53] I also took laranda out for a meal
[06:31:56] whoa sorry there's nothing nothing I
[06:31:59] don't know why I W
[06:32:00] that okay what happened are you two on
[06:32:03] better terms then not my business but
[06:32:05] while you were investigating vash's
[06:32:07] headquarters cland gave testimony on my
[06:32:10] father's behalf it was thanks to her
[06:32:12] that we were able to turn the tide I
[06:32:14] wanted to thank her I mean there's also
[06:32:17] no point in being awkward all the time
[06:32:19] so we took the chance to reconcile with
[06:32:22] each other oh that's great pman also
[06:32:25] thought cland wasn't actually a bad
[06:32:27] person anyway now that the case has
[06:32:30] finally been solved perhaps it will
[06:32:32] slowly begin to fade from theous fade
[06:32:34] first chamber then Harbor now fade
[06:32:37] that's three AG I'm sorry I'll shut
[06:32:38] thing I need to do what is it I should
[06:32:40] pay a visit to my father's grave and
[06:32:43] tell him the truth of what happened as
[06:32:45] well as how it all ended and on top of
[06:32:48] that just how much people still look up
[06:32:50] to him to this
[06:32:52] day that includ udes me too that Marcel
[06:32:56] guy is so weird we should have stole all
[06:32:58] his [ __ ] Mora man he literally said
[06:32:59] if you want Mora we'll give it to you we
[06:33:01] literally should have taken it too we
[06:33:03] also think y all his money go go [ __ ]
[06:33:05] go take
[06:33:07] steal after all without you there might
[06:33:10] not have been such a positive ending
[06:33:13] then in that case everyone let's be off
[06:33:16] considering the recent weather we'll be
[06:33:18] lucky if we can reach P before dark Dam
[06:33:21] n's crying you're right it's been
[06:33:23] raining non yo go yo okay Navia dud she
[06:33:27] cooked him too hard he's crying
[06:33:29] now my man was just doing his
[06:33:33] job this is where my father's grave
[06:33:36] is to be perfectly honest even I haven't
[06:33:40] been back here
[06:33:41] for a long time huh there's someone
[06:33:46] there
[06:33:47] already wait that figure it can't be
[06:33:53] h isn't that nette oh he's here why
[06:33:56] would the Chief Justice be here a he
[06:33:58] cares Navia
[06:34:04] s my apologies I should have asked
[06:34:08] before coming to pay my respects don't
[06:34:10] say that sorry about that
[06:34:14] oh I was trying to say there's no need
[06:34:17] for you to
[06:34:18] apologize I wanted to show my father how
[06:34:20] much I've grown but still I doubt I've
[06:34:23] grown to the point that even the Chief
[06:34:25] Justice would feel compelled to
[06:34:27] apologize to me over and over in that
[06:34:30] case I will stop apologizing for now
[06:34:33] this guy do you yeah this guy does not
[06:34:36] understand how to talk it's okay I'll
[06:34:37] teach him hey net I know this might not
[06:34:40] be the case why did you come to
[06:34:45] Pon well ever since that day I've been
[06:34:49] turning a question over and over in my
[06:34:52] head just what is justice
[06:34:55] anyway there was once a time when I
[06:34:57] didn't want to believe that there could
[06:34:58] be more important to humans than life
[06:35:01] itself oh rather than that it's probably
[06:35:05] more truthful to say I didn't believe
[06:35:07] humans were capable of resisting the
[06:35:08] most Basic Instinct of living things
[06:35:11] that they could rebel against their own
[06:35:13] nature or consider certain things to be
[06:35:15] more important than their own lives
[06:35:18] which is also why I didn't stop your
[06:35:20] father from beginning that fateful Jewel
[06:35:23] I believed that a truly innocent man
[06:35:25] would never throw away his life like
[06:35:27] that that there was nothing should have
[06:35:31] been nothing more important than one's
[06:35:33] own continued survival but Mr callus
[06:35:37] proved me utterly and decisively wrong
[06:35:40] if not for his sacrifice the serial
[06:35:43] disappearances case would have remained
[06:35:45] unsolved to this day Mr callus made the
[06:35:48] choice he did for his daughter for his
[06:35:51] associates and for many people
[06:35:53] completely unrelated to him and in the
[06:35:55] end from a certain
[06:35:58] perspective dude n looks like such a
[06:36:00] five star I don't know how to explain it
[06:36:01] he has too much drip Justice too many
[06:36:03] different color palets Justice that's
[06:36:04] higher than life itself so you asked me
[06:36:08] why like Shades I just wanted to say my
[06:36:12] apologies to Mr Callis in
[06:36:14] person I should have noticed all of this
[06:36:16] much
[06:36:18] sooner this regret has filled me with a
[06:36:21] sadness that has haunted me for days
[06:36:24] that high and mighty chair in the Opera
[06:36:26] epic indeed insulates one from many
[06:36:28] important
[06:36:29] things Spina D
[06:36:31] rosula thank you so much for your hard
[06:36:35] work and
[06:36:36] perseverance
[06:36:38] oh I'm sorry for being mad at you before
[06:36:42] so you're actually one of those types
[06:36:45] that's cold on the outside but pretty
[06:36:47] thoughtful on the inside huh that
[06:36:50] reminds me of silver another silver
[06:36:51] mention my guys too easy
[06:36:54] sorry about that self expression is not
[06:36:57] one of my strong all right I guess I
[06:36:59] like silver now didn't I just say you
[06:37:02] don't need to
[06:37:04] apologize ah so Navia and noet seem to
[06:37:08] have made their piece as well let's not

[06:38:49] don't know who anyone wants I don't know

[06:39:09] right was worth a shot what's up man
[06:39:12] what's up what's up dude oh it's you too
[06:39:16] oh cuz na'vi is here and she's Geo so
[06:39:19] defense no wonder it's Navia it's Navia
[06:39:21] it's na the streets today so we just
[06:39:23] followed her here I see I see then is
[06:39:28] there something that I can help you with
[06:39:30] uh um well let ask a few questions
[06:39:34] please feel free though Outsiders you
[06:39:37] helped us solve one of the greatest
[06:39:38] mysteries in Fontaine and it would be my
[06:39:41] pleasure to return the
[06:39:44] favor um about child is that okay my
[06:39:49] investigation has still not reached its
[06:39:50] conclusion you you body something I
[06:39:53] still believe the judement of the orrice
[06:39:54] was not rendered
[06:39:57] arbitrarily but you also said you
[06:39:59] thought he was innocent for many years I
[06:40:02] have been quite aware that the orrice
[06:40:04] does not simply mechanically repeat the
[06:40:06] verdict that I give on each as a
[06:40:07] divinely created mechanism the people's
[06:40:10] unified faith and the concept of justice
[06:40:12] is integrated into it not only can It
[06:40:14] produce the incredible power of indem
[06:40:16] nium but it likely also possesses other
[06:40:19] traits such as
[06:40:21] self-awareness which is all to say I've
[06:40:23] been prepared for a situation like this
[06:40:25] for a long time huh so when Lenny told
[06:40:29] us that he I was not aware such a thing
[06:40:32] had occurred perhaps that could serve to
[06:40:34] prove my conjecture I will add that to
[06:40:36] the list of items to investigate in any
[06:40:39] case I am inclined to believe that the
[06:40:41] orrice does have a methodology all its
[06:40:43] own we just do not have enough
[06:40:45] information based on farina's reaction I
[06:40:48] doubt even she had any idea what was
[06:40:50] going on she managed to Bluff her way
[06:40:54] the time so true finina so true amazing
[06:40:57] performance 10 out of 10 finina you got
[06:40:59] while we do intend to get to the bottom
[06:41:01] of this for now we regret to say that
[06:41:03] the fouille harbinger will just have to
[06:41:05] bide his time in the Fortress of meped
[06:41:08] finina okay finina is what happens if
[06:41:10] fishal gets born as an archon and
[06:41:12] without AZ to keep her in check it's
[06:41:14] kind of like fishal but like more
[06:41:16] unhinged cuz she actually is an archon
[06:41:18] and Oz isn't there to be like
[06:41:22] chill if we did incorrectly convict him
[06:41:24] of crimes he did not commit net is our
[06:41:27] certainly compensate him to the fullest
[06:41:29] extent Allowed by the law if you ask Pon
[06:41:32] the only compensation he'll want is a no
[06:41:34] Hulk B fight with you is there anything
[06:41:38] else you'd like to ask me
[06:41:41] about Yes actually there's only one of
[06:41:43] about my S why the [ __ ] would you know
[06:41:44] cuz he's dressed like D's Leaf I guess
[06:41:46] he yeah I mean he does hey your sibling
[06:41:49] another blond-haired
[06:41:51] traveler I'm sorry but I've never seen
[06:41:54] look so [ __ ] good dude I actually
[06:41:56] can't if he ever stepped foot in
[06:41:58] Fontaine I'm sure he followed our laws
[06:42:00] to the letter and had no reason to
[06:42:02] appear on the stage of the is there
[06:42:04] anything else you'd like to ask me Yes
[06:42:07] actually uh about the prophecy that the
[06:42:09] sea levels will rise and everyone will
[06:42:11] be dissolved in water leaving finina
[06:42:14] crying alone on her throne much got of
[06:42:16] the people will be finally washed away
[06:42:18] for good does that appropriately
[06:42:20] summarize the version you've heard I me
[06:42:22] yeah man it was Lenny that told us back
[06:42:25] then and that about covers all the main
[06:42:29] points yes up to the present I think we
[06:42:31] reached a point where we have no choice
[06:42:33] but to confront this prophecy directly
[06:42:36] rumors have it that this prophecy is
[06:42:37] rooted in the last words the former
[06:42:40] Hydro Aran greater Lord no I won't say
[06:42:43] it I'm sorry A Prophecy of the former
[06:42:46] Hydro
[06:42:47] archan wow imagine lum's like wait that
[06:42:51] reminds me of the former dendral and
[06:42:52] then it just n
[06:42:54] she just says the name
[06:42:56] boom two parts of the prophecy have
[06:42:58] already proven correct the rising sea
[06:43:01] levels and the ability of the people of
[06:43:03] Fontaine to be dissolved we should be
[06:43:05] more Vigilant and stay on the watch for
[06:43:08] further signs speaking of the prophecy
[06:43:11] finina has also always taken it quite
[06:43:13] seriously indeed she has been collecting
[06:43:16] information and intelligence from across
[06:43:18] toat for this purpose if the rumors were
[06:43:20] true then perhaps this prophecy is the
[06:43:23] can Dundrum left to finina by her
[06:43:25] predecessor but with finina being the
[06:43:28] way she is can we really trust her to
[06:43:31] solve it is there anything else you'd
[06:43:34] like to ask okay it just she didn't
[06:43:35] respond all right about the water from
[06:43:38] the primordial sea so at court the bad
[06:43:41] guys referred to that special water as
[06:43:43] water from the primordial sea but what
[06:43:47] is it really truthfully that name is
[06:43:50] already quite accurate I can only
[06:43:52] surmise that Vash and his ilk only
[06:43:54] learned of its nature and existence
[06:43:55] after extensive research there used to
[06:43:58] be a special Sea on the surface of this
[06:44:00] planet the nature of its seawater was
[06:44:03] rather different from that of the most
[06:44:05] of Tat's life forms were first born in
[06:44:07] that special sea you could say it
[06:44:09] nurtured much of the life on this planet
[06:44:12] okay so it really was where everything
[06:44:15] began it makes sense to call it
[06:44:17] primordial then but today the primordial
[06:44:20] sea no longer exists on the planet's
[06:44:22] surface what Vash discovered must have
[06:44:25] been some kind of special case or a
[06:44:27] Remnant from a truly ancient
[06:44:30] age so that's how it is oh you really
[06:44:35] know everything moio noet but if that's
[06:44:39] the case then why would people uh at
[06:44:43] least people from Fontaine dissolve in
[06:44:45] that kind of water indeed why would the
[06:44:49] primordial sea which was known to
[06:44:50] engender and nurture life suddenly
[06:44:53] reverse itself and devour life
[06:44:57] instead
[06:45:13] H I
[06:45:14] want I'm not going to say I wanted to
[06:45:17] make
[06:45:17] a okay to be frank that also doesn't
[06:45:21] match my understanding of this world and
[06:45:22] its laws
[06:45:24] there must still be some unknown Secrets
[06:45:26] around the people of this
[06:45:32] land is there anything else you
[06:45:38] about
[06:45:43] Dam

[06:45:52] doesn't really make sense but
[06:45:54] but at least Dori told us the sky is

[06:50:50] of card players here in the Fortress
[06:50:52] when I saw you
[06:50:53] I immediately thought hey even Outsiders
[06:50:56] from other nations play cards so I came

[06:51:29] right have you heard any strange rumor
[06:51:31] since you've
[06:51:35] arrived better okay then did you know
[06:51:38] that there are some people who are
[06:51:40] always gossiping over in the
[06:51:44] corner gossiping in the corner I didn't
[06:51:47] I didn't know that skullking around in
[06:51:48] the corners of cor gossiping the bigger
[06:51:51] guy is quisto and the skinny one is
[06:51:54] lavaron people call them the bombshell
[06:51:57] Bros okay I never really found their
[06:51:59] gossip very
[06:52:01] mindblowing it's pretty much just the
[06:52:02] same stuff that I hear about when I'm at
[06:52:04] work every day this is act four not
[06:52:07] three I finished four I'll turn the
[06:52:08] volume up after this cut scene a lot of
[06:52:10] nonsense but they aren't exactly
[06:52:13] bad good to
[06:52:15] know let me think sounds like you want
[06:52:18] to hear something a little more
[06:52:19] tantalizing bombshell Bros did you know
[06:52:23] that the Duke was also a convict in the
[06:52:25] Fortress of mpede before huh wait are
[06:52:29] you serious that's right the Duke was an
[06:52:32] inmate just like you and me seems he was
[06:52:35] exiled here for committing some crime
[06:52:37] rizley was a criminal he knows how he
[06:52:39] ended up rising up to become the warden
[06:52:41] though to go from an ordinary inmate to
[06:52:43] becoming the manager of the whole place
[06:52:46] I'm not going to lie I kind of respect
[06:52:48] that by the way by the way do you happen
[06:52:51] to know anything about a forbidden Zone
[06:52:53] bidden
[06:52:54] Zone sounds like something that someone
[06:52:57] just made up that's just a rumor we've
[06:52:59] been hearing but no worries if you've
[06:53:01] never heard of it do you have anything
[06:53:03] else you can tell us rzz got arrested
[06:53:05] for being too thick it's
[06:53:08] sad not that I can think of but I'll be
[06:53:11] sure to let me turn the volume up let me
[06:53:12] turn the volume up we'll try

[06:55:36] and say something to Mass's ego the
[06:55:38] welfare meals oh my AR Ware
[06:55:41] meals we ate the most incredible welfare
[06:55:44] meal right right that meal we had
[06:55:46] yesterday was super delicious is that so
[06:55:51] to tell you the truth I've been helping
[06:55:53] out with making those welfare meals I've
[06:55:55] been working as a kitchen assistant for
[06:55:57] about a month and a half now oh you're
[06:56:00] the one who made thanks so
[06:56:02] muches you are correct I am a true
[06:56:06] professional in fact I even went to
[06:56:08] kinary school you like my cooking I
[06:56:11] guess that means we share similar tastes
[06:56:14] listen carefully this little bombshell
[06:56:18] will help you learn what's really going
[06:56:20] on here in the
[06:56:21] Fortress
[06:56:23] huh did Lavon just wink at me it seems
[06:56:26] he's saying don't be upset he's a good
[06:56:28] fellow listen kids the power structure
[06:56:32] within the Fortress is quite complicated
[06:56:34] the overworlds couldn't care less about
[06:56:36] us down here we're basically dogs to
[06:56:40] them you've already met the one person
[06:56:42] here he should never cross the Duke
[06:56:44] Risley he knows more than you think and
[06:56:47] if he doesn't care about something then
[06:56:49] he often doesn't bother dealing with it
[06:56:54] those who have the Duke's attention get
[06:56:56] all kinds of special perks even better
[06:56:59] treatment in the
[06:57:01] infirmary wait Chad who's the chii of
[06:57:03] this place called what's her name
[06:57:04] character right I don't think there's
[06:57:06] anything useful about him at all why
[06:57:09] does he visit the infirmary practically
[06:57:11] every day is it normal for anyone going
[06:57:13] in and out of there so often if you ask
[06:57:15] me he's just faking it to get out of
[06:57:18] work but did you know that Chia was a
[06:57:22] talent a researcher from the Fontaine
[06:57:24] Research Institute before he came here
[06:57:27] there's no denying that I don't care if
[06:57:30] he was a researcher that could turn dirt
[06:57:32] into Mora once you're in the Fortress of
[06:57:34] meped you're just another inmate like
[06:57:36] everybody
[06:57:38] else ah interesting according to Quist a
[06:57:42] person named jur frequents the infirmary
[06:57:45] I should take note of that speaking a
[06:57:47] witch the last time I saw him he was
[06:57:49] passing by in the corridor with line I
[06:57:52] also heard they started arguing in the
[06:57:53] library and got into a fight right guess
[06:57:56] that's just how terrible of a guy he is
[06:57:59] you mean he hit a woman wow I never
[06:58:03] imagined he was that bad but that
[06:58:05] lavine's also quite the odd one you know
[06:58:08] she's always gaming away got into a
[06:58:10] fight with a man and she also got sent
[06:58:12] to the
[06:58:13] infirmary come to think of it I always
[06:58:16] see her going to the Sick Bay every
[06:58:18] couple of days too h Huh wait a second
[06:58:23] you don't think do you think could it be
[06:58:26] that they're secretly meeting there to
[06:58:28] go on
[06:58:29] dates ah but it's really hard to
[06:58:33] imagine dude I'm sure this matters but
[06:58:35] like remember
[06:58:37] see to a pult that one
[06:58:39] time and we might be overthinking
[06:58:44] things so had a confrontation with a
[06:58:46] girl named Lin who also frequently
[06:58:49] visits the infirmary I'll remember that
[06:58:51] too

[07:01:24] final report to Father we need to find
[07:01:27] out Master child's exact whereabouts
[07:01:29] father no this isn't act three anymore
[07:01:30] father told me even though Master child
[07:01:32] said he was just coming I hope we get to
[07:01:34] meet father again he actually had some
[07:01:37] personal reasons his agenda might be
[07:01:39] linked to his disappearance the most
[07:01:42] important thing right now is to catch up
[07:01:43] to him crowd is already flooded so we'll
[07:01:46] have to test someone with professional
[07:01:48] diving skills to chase after him well
[07:01:51] when you put it that way it's obvious
[07:01:53] that only frem would be up to the
[07:01:55] task Bingo he's working today why are
[07:01:59] L's eyes AB attracted too much attention
[07:02:01] I'll talk to him about it later please
[07:02:03] do it's the least I can do we're all in
[07:02:06] this together so it's only fair for us
[07:02:08] to fulfill our end of the bargain
[07:02:11] honestly I'm far more impressed by you
[07:02:13] guys managing to collect all this
[07:02:15] information right under risley's
[07:02:17] watchful
[07:02:18] eyes collecting information has always
[07:02:21] been our Point
[07:02:23] true now let me think to find out more
[07:02:27] information fremin will have to retrace
[07:02:30] Master child's original route and if
[07:02:32] he's to do that he'll have to set out on
[07:02:34] the next pipe cleaning day at the
[07:02:36] earliest that's 6 days from
[07:02:39] now okay we can go clean some pipes
[07:02:41] after that he'll probably take another
[07:02:44] two or 3 days to return you can even
[07:02:47] estimate how long it'll take for him to
[07:02:48] get back we've been working together for
[07:02:51] a long long time we know each other's
[07:02:54] capabilities like the backs of our hands
[07:02:56] you don't look like Jean bro that's cuz
[07:02:58] my camera it cuts it cuts too early it
[07:03:01] cuts what you want me to
[07:03:03] do [ __ ] my my thing just
[07:03:10] fell oh and there's just one last thing
[07:03:13] we'd like your help with though we can
[07:03:16] just sit back and wait for fr's report
[07:03:18] on Master child's whereabouts we still
[07:03:20] need to make more progress on on the
[07:03:22] investigation of the forbidden zone
[07:03:24] fremin is no master of disguise
[07:03:26] lynnette's still working on getting
[07:03:27] Intel from the other areas and I'll need
[07:03:30] to spend some time helping fem prepare
[07:03:32] for his diving Mission so you are the
[07:03:35] only ones we can count
[07:03:37] on what do you want us to do will it be
[07:03:40] hard hey it'll well I won't call it easy
[07:03:43] per se but I think you'll be able to
[07:03:45] pull it up wait that's how you spell per
[07:03:47] listen carefully you'll need to find an
[07:03:49] excuse to get into the infirmary and
[07:03:51] investigate the room and environs you
[07:03:54] mentioned several sketchy looking people
[07:03:56] always meeting at the infirmary earlier
[07:03:58] so it probably has something to do with
[07:04:00] the secret we're hoping to uncover
[07:04:02] you've already met the head nurse so
[07:04:04] she'll be less suspicious of you
[07:04:06] investigate the internal structure of
[07:04:08] the infirmary and any active dealings
[07:04:10] within and pass those on to me alongside
[07:04:13] anything else you're able to discover
[07:04:15] but also there's no need to take risks
[07:04:18] don't forget safety always comes sounds
[07:04:20] good my apology jeez I just started
[07:04:23] rambling out of
[07:04:24] habit it was almost as if I was talking
[07:04:27] to my younger sister but that's not a
[07:04:30] bad thing right but what if I'm the
[07:04:32] older sister what dude lumine what the

[07:07:40] my initial checkup there shouldn't be a
[07:07:42] problem here how
[07:07:46] strange oh no was my acting a bit over
[07:07:48] the
[07:07:50] top what about here does this no not
[07:07:53] really
[07:07:55] oh I understand so that's what it is I
[07:07:59] think you just ate something that
[07:08:01] disagreed with you that's all nothing
[07:08:03] too serious huh outside of a pretty bad
[07:08:06] stomach ache when it decides to act up
[07:08:08] true so that's what it is
[07:08:11] M and there have been other inmates
[07:08:14] complaining about the food recently I'll
[07:08:17] inform our head chef Mr D we just threw
[07:08:19] our [ __ ] Chef friend under the bus
[07:08:21] what the hell congratulations the health
[07:08:23] risk is incredibly low so you should
[07:08:25] recover within a couple days why don't
[07:08:27] you here while I go get some medicine
[07:08:30] for you miss line I'll have to trouble
[07:08:33] you to help me look after this new
[07:08:34] patient while I'm gone very
[07:08:38] well I know this is and she hopped away
[07:08:41] just like
[07:08:43] that pH this infiltration mission is
[07:08:45] going much smoother than I imagine next
[07:08:47] there only two people left in the room C
[07:08:49] called that woman Lin so she had to be
[07:08:50] one of those frequent visitors INF me I
[07:08:52] heard before would that mean that man
[07:08:53] next to her is hello how do
[07:08:56] you still not great I can't keep staring
[07:08:59] at her it'll draw unwanted attention
[07:09:00] this guy also seems to have noticed her
[07:09:03] stomach aches really bad she was
[07:09:05] stumbling about the whole way here so
[07:09:06] okay I'm going to say something this
[07:09:08] feels like the [ __ ] biggest waste of
[07:09:10] time I want to mash my space bar but
[07:09:11] obviously it's going to matter they
[07:09:12] wouldn't make us go through all this
[07:09:14] dialogue if these two weren't important
[07:09:15] so I'm sure they're going to matter for
[07:09:16] something but bro I don't care about
[07:09:18] these two [ __ ] random lovers I do not
[07:09:21] care they could literally both die and I
[07:09:23] wouldn't my day would progress the same
[07:09:25] way and there's no need to worry she's
[07:09:27] the best medic we've got down
[07:09:30] here but it also looks like she's the
[07:09:34] only medic you've got down here H well
[07:09:38] that's true well true what do you mean
[07:09:42] that's true that's really
[07:09:44] misrepresenting the
[07:09:46] situation of course I can't speak for
[07:09:48] the whole Fortress but it's not like
[07:09:50] everyone in prisoned here is useless you
[07:09:52] know though they may have committed
[07:09:53] crimes and gotten locked up here as a
[07:09:55] result they still know a thing or two
[07:09:57] about medicine and they help Missin take
[07:09:59] care of the sick and injur it who asked

[07:12:28] continue our previous
[07:12:30] lives the presence of a movable hatch
[07:12:33] isn't strange by itself but perhaps it's
[07:12:35] my adventurers intuition speaking but

[07:18:34] a professional Lynette truly a
[07:18:36] professional truly a professional we
[07:18:39] love to see it Linny would have been
[07:18:41] like it's you again sorry no Lenny
[07:18:44] slander just

[07:18:55] Vinnie show us the full cosplay I don't

[07:19:01] deck so I
[07:19:06] could I swear by my sword I had a thigh
[07:19:10] strap but it it it broke cuz my thighs
[07:19:12] are too thick did you shave no I didn't
[07:19:14] shave why am i showing you guys my legs
[07:19:16] this is weird all right back to this yo
[07:19:19] yo my bad my bad yo don't clip
[07:19:29] that you twitched you as true we're fine
[07:19:33] this is what they
[07:19:45] wanted did you two run into any trouble
[07:19:47] over the past few days uh I was in the
[07:19:50] Vermilion domain according to the
[07:19:52] schedule nothing weird happened there's
[07:19:54] like a Runing grader but he's not that
[07:19:56] bad honestly it was pretty fine good
[07:19:58] that means you didn't raise any
[07:19:59] suspicions when you infiltrated the
[07:20:01] infirmary okay we've taken a look at the
[07:20:03] slip you've sent frem successfully left
[07:20:06] the grounds via the pipes 2 days ago and
[07:20:08] as of last night Lynette has also
[07:20:11] infiltrated the infirmary after faking
[07:20:13] an
[07:20:13] illness wait why is she getting involved
[07:20:16] as
[07:20:17] well you already went above and beyond
[07:20:20] when you you scoped out the infirmary to
[07:20:22] put it more bluntly even if we were to
[07:20:24] view that as something you did in
[07:20:26] exchange for fremin's help you've
[07:20:28] already done more than enough thanks
[07:20:30] Lenny infiltrating a guarded stronghold
[07:20:32] is a different kind of job from a
[07:20:34] one-off investigation we want to avoid
[07:20:36] using the same faces over and over and
[07:20:38] reduce the amount of suspicion that will
[07:20:40] fall on any given person Lynette also
[07:20:43] felt like you have already taken the
[07:20:44] first step for us so she should be the
[07:20:46] one to finish the job thanks Lynette so
[07:20:49] that's what Lynette thinks
[07:20:51] oh Pon hopes everything's going well for
[07:20:54] her yeah I'm not opposed to helping you
[07:20:57] perhaps that's true you are both very
[07:21:00] good people and we've come to appreciate
[07:21:03] that more than anyone else unfortunately
[07:21:06] there's still one thing that could get
[07:21:08] between us lest you've forgotten the
[07:21:10] matter of our respective loyalties
[07:21:13] you've mentioned before that you've had
[07:21:14] some run-ins with the
[07:21:16] fouille I can understand that feeling so
[07:21:19] I assume you're just helping us out of
[07:21:20] the kindness of your
[07:21:22] hearts well everyone could use some more
[07:21:24] friends we'll be counting on you to help
[07:21:27] too I Lenny let's talk for a second okay
[07:21:30] since I see you as friends then it's
[07:21:32] even more important for us to protect
[07:21:33] you from any Peril F and Lynette feel
[07:21:36] the same way listen you your sister and
[07:21:39] whoever the [ __ ] the other guy is you

[07:21:45] Lynette she's cool fem a diver who
[07:21:48] drowned in the first trailer we saw of
[07:21:50] him despite him being prone to being a
[07:21:52] diver but the event was cool with the
[07:21:53] penguin that was that was cool anyways
[07:21:55] so you guys are that's cool however
[07:21:57] regarding our loyalty and the fouille
[07:21:59] right I know you guys are like villains

[07:22:04] father figure right are likein

[07:22:12] and I have to choose between my current
[07:22:14] loyalties and them just know that it's
[07:22:18] nothing personal but I I would give up
[07:22:20] my life to be ar Lino's chair

[07:22:34] saying I'm just
[07:22:36] saying okay I get it a lot of them are
[07:22:39] criminals they've done heinous acts the
[07:22:41] Tor is
[07:22:42] unforgivable child's a terrorist
[07:22:46] allegedly but if I have to choose a side
[07:22:49] not excusing their actions but I would I
[07:22:51] might as well watch I can't stop them so
[07:22:53] I might as well be there I'll watch I
[07:22:55] can't stop them what I'm going to stop
[07:22:57] [ __ ] cppy Tano what the [ __ ] am I

[07:23:18] well watch
[07:23:23] glad to hear
[07:23:25] it then let's go check on Lynette before
[07:23:28] fremin returns sorry if everything went
[07:23:30] well then she should be wrapping up her
[07:23:32] investigation right about
[07:23:34] now it's now really a good time to go
[07:23:39] over according to my observations seen
[07:23:42] always spends around half an hour away
[07:23:44] from the infirmary right before lunch
[07:23:46] half an hour Lynette knows this as well
[07:23:48] so this should be a good time up with
[07:23:51] her okay oh yeah we heard about that
[07:23:53] also I'm her brother remember it's only
[07:23:56] natural for an older brother to care
[07:23:58] about his younger sister's
[07:24:00] wellbeing okay then let's head over
[07:24:02] right away
[07:24:05] cool let's go
[07:24:09] over oh V's
[07:24:13] protector nice Lynette should be here
[07:24:16] right now
[07:24:18] huh
[07:24:20] strange Lynette as expected seen isn't
[07:24:24] here but why isn't Lynette here could
[07:24:28] she have found a lead and left the
[07:24:30] follow it no Lynette rarely deviates
[07:24:32] from the plan we agreed that if she were
[07:24:35] to make changes on the Fly should find a
[07:24:36] way to let me know oh [ __ ] unless oh no
[07:24:41] let's see if there are any clues around
[07:24:42] here we can look while we wait for her
[07:24:48] okay oh
[07:24:52] [ __ ] why is this music kind of
[07:24:56] Epic wait this music is actually
[07:24:59] yo there are some books here and a few
[07:25:02] files they all look like medical records
[07:25:05] H advanced nursing how to raise the
[07:25:08] spirit of your patients a quick guide to
[07:25:11] the site these sure are some interesting
[07:25:13] books who knew seen would be interested
[07:25:16] in these kinds of things she even has
[07:25:19] books on understanding understanding
[07:25:20] people's motivations and
[07:25:22] feelings H is it because she's a meloine
[07:25:25] or does she have a need to understand
[07:25:27] her patient's emotional state she
[07:25:30] manipulates seems quite normal to me
[07:25:32] maybe not I don't know these are skills
[07:25:33] that would come in handy for a nurse
[07:25:35] from time to time
[07:25:47] true none of the beds have any of having
[07:25:50] been slept in except that one over there
[07:25:54] that's the one Lynette must have used
[07:25:56] right you said she was pretending to be
[07:25:58] sick mhm she would have said her
[07:26:01] migraine was having a particularly bad
[07:26:03] flare up generally speaking the head
[07:26:06] nurse would then ask her to lie down and
[07:26:08] rest while she left to retrieve the but
[07:26:10] this bed is unmade which means either
[07:26:13] the head didn't return the entire time
[07:26:15] from when Lynette laid down up until she
[07:26:17] left the bed or the nurse intentionally
[07:26:20] left it this
[07:26:22] way why would they leave it that way
[07:26:26] that's
[07:26:28] suspicious let me let me check this
[07:26:30] hatch over here that lumine talked about
[07:26:32] eight [ __ ] times if there's she
[07:26:33] mentioned it so many times this has to
[07:26:35] be pivotal to the story if it's not I'm
[07:26:37] quitting get
[07:26:38] impact ah this is it we saw it before
[07:26:42] wait this thing if it is I'm becoming a
[07:26:44] l Skipper doesn't look like it's been
[07:26:45] disguised that
[07:26:48] well
[07:26:50] wait genin just tweeted wait wait wait
[07:26:52] is there something new wait wait wait
[07:26:53] wait one second from its size I don't
[07:26:56] think it's an entrance that is meant to
[07:26:58] be taken apart there's probably a
[07:27:01] mechanism around here somewhere genius
[07:27:03] invocation
[07:27:05] TCG of
[07:27:07] course CH do you guys have demon RZ I
[07:27:09] can use hey haha are you a demon
[07:27:15] because
[07:27:17] don't chat you guys are literally going
[07:27:19] to get a restraining order okay I never
[07:27:22] mind let's let's move on okay the space
[07:27:24] behind it is empty from its size I don't
[07:27:26] think the entrance that is meant to be
[07:27:27] taken apart there's probably me
[07:27:28] mechanism around here somewhere could
[07:27:30] Lynette have tried to get
[07:27:32] inside but if that's the case she would
[07:27:34] have contacted me for
[07:27:39] sure let's look around here for some
[07:27:41] more clues Don't Panic just take another
[07:27:44] look hey haha are you a demon cuz I'm an
[07:27:47] angel wait wait wait that's actually yo
[07:27:51] you kind of cooked you might be a demon
[07:27:53] but you could be my angle wait did I
[07:27:55] make it better or worse be honest no so
[07:27:59] bad okay Angelic Riz okay thanks
[07:28:05] Chad look on L's face definitely
[07:28:07] beginning to panic Don't Panic bro said
[07:28:09] subconsciously okay true why are you
[07:28:12] roasting
[07:28:13] Linny he's worried about his sister
[07:28:16] man hey you guys I am too I like over
[07:28:19] you
[07:28:20] a slip of paper it's right over here and
[07:28:24] there's a bunch written on it too it
[07:28:29] reads out of respect for your usual
[07:28:32] practices I'll use a piece of paper or
[07:28:35] card as the medium to pass on my message
[07:28:38] you may consider this as me giving you
[07:28:40] my best regards this is is is that all
[07:28:45] is there anything on the back the
[07:28:48] back show me now
[07:28:51] uh-oh
[07:28:54] uh-oh
[07:28:56] uh-oh that look on your face P's reading
[07:29:00] it now would you care to guess where
[07:29:02] Miss Lynette of the foule could be right
[07:29:05] now no could have is she already wait
[07:29:10] what Ley did he deliberately leave the
[07:29:14] infirmary unguarded to use it as
[07:29:17] bait wait you mean I mean he was aware
[07:29:20] of our goals from the very beginning but
[07:29:23] why we didn't run into any trouble last
[07:29:26] time and he also never reached out to us
[07:29:28] since why would he choose the ACT drink
[07:29:30] or second infiltration and have this as
[07:29:32] the first yes that is a crucial
[07:29:35] question Risley he doesn't do anything
[07:29:39] without a clear goal or Reason so this
[07:29:41] means he had no one sister I guess
[07:29:43] activities from the very beginning you
[07:29:45] are not from the same camp as us you
[07:29:48] were sent down here by nerv
[07:29:49] so you have no with Ry we're a
[07:29:53] completely different story though why
[07:29:54] don't go after to Lynette why didn't he
[07:29:56] go after you as
[07:29:57] well I'd like to know that too why did
[07:30:00] he only go after
[07:30:03] her don't panic just think everything
[07:30:06] over I have to stay calm this is not
[07:30:09] like what happened last time the
[07:30:10] Situation's different
[07:30:13] now uh-oh lind's panicking wait you're
[07:30:17] right wait but that means the fact that
[07:30:20] frem was able to leave the grounds could
[07:30:23] Risley have let him go as well but what
[07:30:26] does he gain by letting F leave like
[07:30:28] that I get it now
[07:30:32] you're he deliberately made them both
[07:30:35] disappear so he's challenging me and
[07:30:37] trying to provoke me I'm sure of
[07:30:40] it minus two siblings we never should
[07:30:43] have sent out frem we had to go through
[07:30:46] all that trouble to find an opening to
[07:30:47] sneak him around the guards and into the
[07:30:49] pipe and we even thought luck was on our
[07:30:51] side if Risley let him leave on purpose
[07:30:55] then he's probably in a terrible spot
[07:30:57] now as well Lenny's getting more and
[07:30:59] more panicked we have to calm him down
[07:31:02] Lenny calm down yes that'll I'm sure
[07:31:04] that'll work don't be like this Lenny F
[07:31:07] wouldn't have left if we hadn't told you
[07:31:08] about child that was our fault no I'm
[07:31:12] the leader of this operation and I'm the
[07:31:14] one responsible for this team I was the
[07:31:17] one who failed to protect them
[07:31:20] I'll go talk to Risley hey don't be
[07:31:23] Reckless traveler please I simply cannot
[07:31:26] allow Lynette to be abducted again I
[07:31:29] have to go I'll find a way to get them
[07:31:31] back
[07:31:35] go he's rushed out the door after
[07:31:39] him why is she
[07:31:45] there what the [ __ ] I feel like we still
[07:31:49] have some room to make changes on these
[07:31:52] details it's okay she's going to help us
[07:31:54] but it'll require extensive testing is
[07:31:57] that
[07:31:58] so very well then please be mindful of
[07:32:01] the
[07:32:04] time
[07:32:06] huh is someone pack everything up uh-oh
[07:32:11] pack what up side is e dropping they'll

[07:32:41] a delightful turn of
[07:32:42] events I like smart people but I also

[07:32:48] dumb I like the feeling of being
[07:32:52] trusted oh my what's wrong little one
[07:32:55] there's no need to panic take a deep
[07:32:57] breath before you
[07:33:01] begin being able to read human
[07:33:03] Expressions is quite the useful skill
[07:33:06] okay she better have a Redemption Arc in
[07:33:07] this Quest cuz right now I want to roll
[07:33:09] her off a cliff but maybe her intentions

[07:33:52] come out and face me
[07:33:56] Risley aren't we at an administrative
[07:33:59] office space why don't you at least try
[07:34:01] to follow even a couple rules from the
[07:34:03] fortress's indoor management regulations
[07:34:05] I know that guy what did you do to my
[07:34:07] sister I ran into the young Miss at the
[07:34:10] infirmary I'd heard that she was
[07:34:11] suffering from quite the migraine so I
[07:34:13] decided to invite her over for a cup of
[07:34:15] tea I do have some teas in my collection
[07:34:18] that can work wonders against such an
[07:34:19] illness oh do you have some spare
[07:34:21] tee where did you take my
[07:34:24] siblings I have also heard that your
[07:34:27] performances are quite the spectacle
[07:34:29] Miss Lynette would sometimes enter a box
[07:34:31] filled with water only to emerge the
[07:34:33] next second from another place
[07:34:35] altogether if you want to emerge you
[07:34:38] right now if you were to turn your head
[07:34:40] is he trying to trick me into turning my
[07:34:43] head no he's probably not looking to
[07:34:46] attack me right now all of the hostages
[07:34:48] are in his hands hands and he's even in
[07:34:50] the mood for small talk that means
[07:34:52] Lynette is probably still alive you knew
[07:34:55] we were investigating the infirmary from
[07:34:57] the start so you deliberately aroused
[07:35:00] The Traveler suspicions and baited us
[07:35:01] into continuing our investigation just
[07:35:04] so that you'd be able to kidnap
[07:35:07] Lynette as for
[07:35:09] fremin no you probably didn't even
[07:35:12] interfere with child's Escape you let
[07:35:15] him go so you could Purge the foule
[07:35:17] members that we had planted into your
[07:35:18] ring DRS there was no need to do so the
[07:35:22] Fortress of meped is a pretty Pleasant
[07:35:24] Place most people enjoy their lives here
[07:35:27] the only ones who act differently are
[07:35:29] those with personal agendas it was quite
[07:35:32] easy to identify your colleagues you
[07:35:35] removed our original members and spread
[07:35:37] the news of child's Escape so father
[07:35:38] would assign our team to come down and
[07:35:40] investigate frin has also fallen into
[07:35:43] your hands right if you're oh so
[07:35:45] omnipotent and so in control why would
[07:35:47] you need hostages yo low key though okay
[07:35:51] I'm not siding obviously we're siding
[07:35:53] with like L Lenny here cuz you know but
[07:35:56] low key kind of a giga Chad move to just
[07:35:58] get like [ __ ] minus four fatou you
[07:36:00] just trapped three and you could have
[07:36:02] done whatever you wanted with child and
[07:36:03] you're probably baiting arino that's
[07:36:05] like minus
[07:36:11] five one correction they're literally
[07:36:14] children is in my hands right now but
[07:36:16] for I mean true but
[07:36:22] he's
[07:36:24] not what do you really
[07:36:27] want
[07:36:30] lny oh wonderful everyone is here so
[07:36:33] I'll only need to say this once thank
[07:36:36] you so much for cooperating with
[07:36:40] me they're not children well they're
[07:36:43] like arino like I want to say tools I
[07:36:46] don't really know the lore yet cuz we're
[07:36:47] only at act four but
[07:36:49] I feel like they are I feel like you you
[07:36:51] use like if anything you use them to
[07:36:53] bait AR
[07:36:55] Lino where are lenette and
[07:36:59] from eager into the point I see alas
[07:37:02] only miss Lynette is currently having a
[07:37:04] cup of the fortress's finest
[07:37:07] tea although as per your original plan
[07:37:11] Mr frem should also have returned to the
[07:37:13] Fortress by now but he has neither shown
[07:37:15] up within my Gates nor has he been taken
[07:37:18] into any any kind of custody so where do
[07:37:20] you think he may be right now he's
[07:37:23] diving he's a diver you can't mean you
[07:37:26] locked him outside in the sea oh well I
[07:37:29] was kidding I closed the fortress's gate
[07:37:31] to the outside world that's all fine is
[07:37:35] a star diver so he should be fine right
[07:37:38] no we're still here so we definitely
[07:37:41] tried to find a way to come back for us
[07:37:43] so we can't assume he might have made a
[07:37:45] break for the surface but why would I do
[07:37:48] this you may be
[07:37:49] asking to have an audience with you of
[07:37:52] course my Intel tells me that Mr Linny
[07:37:55] is a great magician so it's only natural
[07:37:57] for me to want to have some cards of my
[07:37:59] own when it comes to
[07:38:00] negotiating besides I do recall you
[07:38:03] mentioning to miss Lynette that you've
[07:38:05] always wanted to have a face-to-face
[07:38:07] meeting with the Lord of The Fortress of
[07:38:09] marp you could just of whether it was in
[07:38:11] a personal or a professional capacity
[07:38:14] well you got your wish oh I get it rizle
[07:38:18] okay he has a a big brain a big ass
[07:38:21] respectfully so obviously you can't have
[07:38:23] a big heart you can't have all three
[07:38:25] that would be imbalanced so obviously
[07:38:27] he's acting without his heart here but
[07:38:29] he's using his brain so clearly because
[07:38:31] he's backloaded and there's that we have
[07:38:33] that information he won't factor in the
[07:38:35] feelings here because his heart okay
[07:38:37] that makes sense and then net is like
[07:38:39] the like that's where the US before we
[07:38:41] even set foot in the Fortress some of my
[07:38:44] folks just happen to hear a thing or two
[07:38:46] that's all in any case I will be
[07:38:48] straight with you I was willing to play
[07:38:50] dumb and turn a blind eye so we had a
[07:38:53] pleasant few days playing games together
[07:38:55] here but once you started focusing on
[07:38:57] the forbidden zone all of that changed
[07:39:00] Mr Linny the cards are stacked against
[07:39:03] you right now miss lenette is in my
[07:39:05] hands and Mr frem is still slowly being
[07:39:08] pickled out there in the brine D you
[07:39:10] know just as why is f getting pickled
[07:39:13] what the [ __ ] did fem do dude what did
[07:39:15] fem do wrong he's just he's just diving
[07:39:18] man he just just diving why is he
[07:39:21] getting pickled you need do but one
[07:39:22] thing to guarantee their
[07:39:24] safety I would like you to contact your
[07:39:27] Superior and ideally invite her over for
[07:39:29] a cup of tea with me you want to see
[07:39:33] father I literally okay maybe it was
[07:39:36] just obvious but I told you he he just
[07:39:38] traps he traps the kids well I know
[07:39:40] they're not technically kids but you
[07:39:41] know what I mean like AR Lino's kids to
[07:39:42] [ __ ] bait arino boom minus one fou
[07:39:46] leader well if she cares for the
[07:39:49] well-being of her dearest children she
[07:39:50] should have plenty of motivation to join
[07:39:52] me for a parents evening I've heard that
[07:39:55] the bonds between the members of the
[07:39:56] House of the Hearth are like the bonds
[07:39:58] of family I don't see why she would
[07:40:01] refuse why did you think father sent us
[07:40:03] to handle the Fortress of meped this
[07:40:06] place is basically a No Man's Land it
[07:40:08] wouldn't be fitting for anyone as
[07:40:10] important as a Harbinger like father to
[07:40:12] come here in person oh I see so it's
[07:40:17] because she doesn't care for my place
[07:40:19] here bam that's [ __ ] that's such a
[07:40:22] shame after all I've amassed quite the
[07:40:24] tea collection I was looking forward to
[07:40:26] sharing it with her both M net and lady
[07:40:30] finina have already received many s
[07:40:33] gifts was this the extent of your master
[07:40:36] plan to get to Father no matter how much
[07:40:39] pressure you may put on me I won't allow
[07:40:41] you to use us to blackmail
[07:40:44] her you people really are difficult to
[07:40:47] get along with all I'm asking for is a
[07:40:49] face-to-face conversation does she truly
[07:40:51] have no interest in the fortress's
[07:40:53] secret Mr Linny you have one last chance
[07:40:57] to invite your father here if you
[07:41:03] refuse yes what happens if he oh
[07:41:07] Linny why do you have to do this instead
[07:41:09] of asking why I'm doing this why don't
[07:41:12] you try to see things from my
[07:41:13] perspective for a second from the very
[07:41:16] beginning the fouille has been actively
[07:41:18] infiltrating my Fortress I gave you a
[07:41:21] warning by cutting off the first few
[07:41:22] operatives I found but that only caused
[07:41:24] you to Double Down had you given up on
[07:41:26] the Fortress then and there I'd have no
[07:41:28] reason to want to talk Mr frem left the
[07:41:31] fortress on his own and Miss Lynette
[07:41:34] tried to pry out my secrets right in
[07:41:36] front of me no matter how you look at it
[07:41:40] the responsibility for This falls on you
[07:41:43] I mean that does make sense I shouldn't
[07:41:45] ask father to do anything because of us
[07:41:49] six yo chill wait
[07:41:52] I
[07:41:54] two 1 time's
[07:41:58] up it really is a shame Mr Lenny
[07:42:02] Risley negotiations have broken down
[07:42:06] please leave ladies and gentlemen it's
[07:42:08] time for my afternoon tea yo give us a
[07:42:12] little more time can we not talk about
[07:42:14] this some more yeah listen to The
[07:42:16] Traveler if you can't talk please talk
[07:42:18] to us you do realize that I'm only
[07:42:21] letting you go because of net yes
[07:42:26] you I've already done my best to stay
[07:42:28] out of your way but that doesn't mean
[07:42:30] you can just do whatever you want the
[07:42:33] Fortress may be small and remote but it
[07:42:36] still has its own set of [ __ ] dude when
[07:42:38] I saw this option I thought we got to
[07:42:39] choose like I thought it was going to be
[07:42:40] like frinet and Lynette or like Len and
[07:42:43] L like I thought we got to choose two
[07:42:45] that's the same option H hm
[07:42:49] H then how about this those who are
[07:42:53] capable deserve respect you've spent
[07:42:55] quite some time investigating my home
[07:42:56] turf by now so why don't you tell me a
[07:42:58] thing or two about what you found H I'll
[07:43:01] ask you three questions answer all of
[07:43:03] them
[07:43:04] correctly questions it's fine I got this
[07:43:06] i got this regarding the hidden rules of
[07:43:09] the production Zone yeah what is the
[07:43:11] truth behind the one about not being
[07:43:13] allowed to work for 3 days in a row I
[07:43:15] remember this I remember this not being
[07:43:17] allowed to work for 3 days in a
[07:43:21] row yeah you get the Strange meat okay
[07:43:27] cool what happens if you violate I'm not
[07:43:30] going to look at chat for this I'm not
[07:43:31] going to look at chat for this I'm not
[07:43:32] going to look at chat for this okay I'm
[07:43:33] not going to look at chat regarding the
[07:43:35] hidden rule of the production Zone the
[07:43:36] truth behind one about not being allowed
[07:43:38] to work for 3 days in a row what happens
[07:43:39] if you violate the production Zone's
[07:43:41] hidden rule if you break the hit rule of
[07:43:43] the production Zone your Ware meal might
[07:43:44] contain some strange meat yes I
[07:43:46] remember oh what will you see if who
[07:43:49] will you see if you keep working
[07:43:50] continuously I've been told that the
[07:43:52] infirmary is always empty for the half
[07:43:54] hour just before
[07:43:56] lunch the font promoter has been
[07:43:58] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[07:44:00] the real value of coupons I remember
[07:44:03] doing this I did this on my phone in the
[07:44:04] train du believes that only idiots who
[07:44:06] don't understand the value of coupons
[07:44:08] would spend did the mean just say
[07:44:10] idiots we often see Miss SI observing
[07:44:13] the prisoners at work font's internal
[07:44:15] reports suggest that they're starting a
[07:44:16] new trial yes I remember that de an
[07:44:18] unpackaged
[07:44:20] product the research notes said that the
[07:44:22] meloine race perceives the world very
[07:44:24] differently from humans because of that
[07:44:27] the according to Collins the pancre
[07:44:30] tournament only took place because the
[07:44:32] font company sponsored
[07:44:34] it okay okay so I know that the font was
[07:44:39] sus and I know that after 3 days we got
[07:44:42] a meal when we ordered it and then we
[07:44:44] just didn't eat it or some [ __ ] but I
[07:44:45] don't know if we saw someone maybe we
[07:44:47] saw s win I don't remember if we saw
[07:44:49] someone though for the half just before
[07:44:51] lunch oh maybe it's this that might be
[07:44:54] the clue wa what is this has struggling
[07:44:56] because he doesn't we often see misser
[07:44:59] this production Zone wait it's actually
[07:45:01] definitely that internal think it's this
[07:45:03] one we often seen the
[07:45:06] seizur wait does it mean I got it I
[07:45:08] think I got it under what circumstances
[07:45:10] does a strange meat appear hey hey hey
[07:45:14] according to Collins the pancre turn we
[07:45:17] often see strange meat promoter has been
[07:45:20] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[07:45:22] the real value of
[07:45:24] coupons so I remember we got strange
[07:45:26] meat we got uh a package in the mail
[07:45:29] with like blood or a potion or like
[07:45:30] something poison I don't know and
[07:45:32] there's another thing there's three sins
[07:45:33] that we did I just don't remember which
[07:45:35] was which one of them was like when we
[07:45:37] bet on both
[07:45:39] dudes yeah this one I remember we bet on
[07:45:41] two of the wrong things but I don't
[07:45:42] think the strange me was from that was
[07:45:43] it the font promoter has been the
[07:45:46] research not said that the m I'm going
[07:45:48] to click it but I don't think this is
[07:45:49] right oh my God I'm a [ __ ] genius if
[07:45:52] that means I won I don't know research
[07:45:54] not said that why does a strange meat
[07:45:56] appear the way it
[07:45:57] does the Font because they're
[07:46:00] experimenting they're experimenting
[07:46:02] where is it they're they're putting test
[07:46:04] subjects in our water new trial of an
[07:46:07] unnamed and unpackaged
[07:46:11] product okay I got the first one I got
[07:46:13] the first one W I got the first one see
[07:46:15] I got the first one I got the first one
[07:46:16] I might have [ __ ] up the last two cuz
[07:46:18] I didn't remember dude dude I thought
[07:46:19] the meat was from the first thing though
[07:46:21] but I actually got the first one did I
[07:46:23] miss any
[07:46:24] alerts no well only a few follows thanks
[07:46:26] for follows ha okay sorry uh under what
[07:46:29] circum strange meet appear I've been
[07:46:31] told that the infirmary is always empty
[07:46:33] for the half the font promoter has been
[07:46:35] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[07:46:37] the real value of coupon font's internal
[07:46:40] reports suggest that they're starting a
[07:46:41] new trial of an unnamed and unpackaged
[07:46:45] product but this
[07:46:48] why does the strange meet appear said
[07:46:50] the wait I might have [ __ ] up I might
[07:46:52] have [ __ ] up it might have been vice
[07:46:54] versa struggling a I [ __ ] up I think
[07:46:57] this one goes to the other one [ __ ] how
[07:46:59] do I change it go back go back go
[07:47:02] back okay so the the the testing wait
[07:47:05] was the huh internal
[07:47:08] reports why does the strange meat appear
[07:47:10] what it does theine race perceives the
[07:47:13] world very differently from humans
[07:47:15] according to Collins the pancre
[07:47:17] tournament only took place because the
[07:47:21] font okay let me think let me think this
[07:47:24] time okay full Focus this not I'm
[07:47:26] actually thinking oh wait it just shows
[07:47:27] me the
[07:47:30] answer oh no it doesn't okay I'm
[07:47:32] actually think I'm actually thinking why
[07:47:34] would the strange me dude it's when you
[07:47:35] break three rules or like when you break
[07:47:37] a rule like one of the Hidden rules I've
[07:47:39] been told that the infirmary is always
[07:47:40] empty for the half hour what is C making
[07:47:43] the [ __ ] schme the the bad meat the
[07:47:45] font promoter has been struggling
[07:47:47] because he does maybe research not said
[07:47:49] that the meloine race perceives the
[07:47:51] world very differently from humans okay
[07:47:53] maybe that's it maybe she's just
[07:47:55] poisoning the meat or some [ __ ] okay why
[07:47:57] does it strange meat appear that it does
[07:47:58] the Font promoter has been because the
[07:48:00] font wants good return on investment
[07:48:02] said that the mine race perceives the
[07:48:04] world very differently from humans maybe
[07:48:06] it's this because of that the melines
[07:48:08] have also developed a sense of
[07:48:10] Aesthetics that appear rather strange
[07:48:12] and alien to humans it says appear and
[07:48:14] here it says appear so maybe that's a
[07:48:15] clue jeepers
[07:48:21] yes sorry I'll calm down g g yeah yeah
[07:48:24] I'm sorry gen wouldn't react like that
[07:48:27] who would have
[07:48:30] guessed CH it's only two hours in the
[07:48:33] Stream I guess it's been three cuz my
[07:48:34] stream crashed and I already have to pee
[07:48:37] and taking off the genan causeway to pee
[07:48:38] is not easy the hidden rule of the
[07:48:41] production Zone people are not supposed
[07:48:44] to work 3 days in a row andit strange
[07:48:48] meat in their welfare meal the [ __ ] is
[07:48:50] Pon
[07:48:52] wearing at first we thought this strange
[07:48:54] meat must have something to do with the
[07:48:56] people who disappeared but in reality
[07:49:00] they were all prepared by seen the head
[07:49:09] nurse she often visits the production
[07:49:11] Zone to observe the workers's health and
[07:49:14] makes a note of anyone who has worn
[07:49:16] themselves out after three full days of
[07:49:18] work out of her sense of Duty as the
[07:49:20] head nurse as well as her genuine
[07:49:22] concern for the worker's Health SE
[07:49:24] visits the cafeteria right before lunch
[07:49:27] and Cooks an extra dish for those who
[07:49:29] can use the stamina boost seen has only
[07:49:32] the best intentions with her surprise
[07:49:35] gift and doesn't want anyone to find out
[07:49:37] about what she
[07:49:38] does however unfortunately melines as a
[07:49:42] race perceive the world differently from
[07:49:45] humans and their sense of athetic is
[07:49:48] even the recipients of her lovingly
[07:49:51] prepared special meals cannot taste the
[07:49:54] care within and usually just freak out I
[07:49:56] mean that's wholesome but don't let her
[07:49:59] cook not bad can rizzly headlock me you
[07:50:02] cover secret and even guessed her
[07:50:03] intentions correctly as well it's nice
[07:50:06] to know that her efforts have not gone
[07:50:08] unacknowledged all right now for my next
[07:50:10] question oh god there are also some
[07:50:12] hidden rules in the pancre ring
[07:50:15] including the one that you're not
[07:50:16] allowed to support both sides I have to
[07:50:18] pee before we do this I remember this
[07:50:20] one I remember this rule chat I have to
[07:50:21] go pee I don't know how I'm going to
[07:50:24] take this off to pee uh wish me luck I
[07:50:26] might bring food down so I can eat while

[07:50:47] broccoli but I finished most of the
[07:50:48] chicken so there's rice and broccoli now

[07:51:36] fluid cool I've been told that the
[07:51:38] infirmary is always EMP no it's not cin

[07:51:44] people they have they control the the
[07:51:48] the the the stadium so if you try to rig
[07:51:50] it they rig your
[07:51:54] life we often see
[07:51:56] Miss at work the font promoter has been
[07:51:59] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[07:52:01] the real value of coupons the research
[07:52:04] note said that a according to Collins
[07:52:07] the pancre tournament only took place
[07:52:09] because the wait but it says who so do I

[07:52:37] Doesn't dude I had the right hypothesis
[07:52:39] though I literally had the right
[07:52:40] hypothesis spored
[07:52:44] it we often see Miss
[07:52:48] according to
[07:52:49] Collins I've been told that the
[07:52:51] infirmary is we often see Miss the font
[07:52:54] promoter
[07:52:56] has
[07:52:58] Eureka okay time to
[07:53:02] eat pinea gets this rule too now so
[07:53:05] there really was nothing to be afraid
[07:53:08] of that hidden rule of the pantion ring
[07:53:12] is about how um people are not supposed
[07:53:16] to bet on both boxers at the same time
[07:53:19] and if they do they'll receive a package
[07:53:21] containing a strange blood colored
[07:53:24] liquid people get scared when they see
[07:53:27] it because they've subconsciously begun
[07:53:29] to associate it with the missing
[07:53:35] boxer but really it's just a bottle of
[07:53:37] the latest yet to be named and packaged
[07:53:40] new font a trial product a blood red
[07:53:44] drink it's no wonder even find his own
[07:53:46] St for questioning the company's
[07:53:48] decision making the company facing
[07:53:51] backlash from its own staff decided to
[07:53:54] try to trial the product on a smaller
[07:53:56] scale to see how it might be received by
[07:53:59] customers they came to the Fortress of
[07:54:01] meped and offered to sponsor the panra
[07:54:04] tournament so they could push their new
[07:54:06] product but the Duke completely refused
[07:54:09] to even entertain the idea the Duke
[07:54:12] knowing how valuable coupons are in The
[07:54:15] Fortress knew that only total idiots who
[07:54:18] didn't understand their true value would
[07:54:20] bother buying a font product
[07:54:22] here and so only those who proved their
[07:54:26] stupidity by being dumb enough to bet on
[07:54:29] two opposing sides of the same match
[07:54:31] were selected to receive the drinks I
[07:54:34] acknowledge the of stupid Li bring the
[07:54:36] truth of this mystery to
[07:54:39] light although based on your description
[07:54:41] that font promoter is a bit too careless
[07:54:43] with his words I may just reconsider my
[07:54:46] collaboration with the company all right
[07:54:49] and here's the final question what's the
[07:54:52] secret behind our head nurse all of her
[07:54:55] patients in the
[07:54:59] infirmary oh we don't
[07:55:02] know she's actually a murderer she's
[07:55:05] [ __ ] she's no not
[07:55:09] CLE stop your cruel in pointless games
[07:55:12] Risley she's cap you know that we
[07:55:14] haven't finished our investigation so
[07:55:16] there's no way we can answer the last
[07:55:17] question the thought of sparing Lynette
[07:55:19] and femin never even crossed your
[07:55:22] mind Lenny you'll pay for this whoa
[07:55:26] whoa he's way more built than
[07:55:29] you this are you all

[07:55:52] gun
[07:55:56] you not at all I am merely a resident of

[07:56:06] me that my job would be to take care of
[07:56:08] the wellbeing of everyone here I am
[07:56:11] merely discharging my duties but if you
[07:56:14] mean what you just said then isn't Lenny

[07:56:18] well isn't why not learn a thing or do
[07:56:20] from nette but I really am just doing
[07:56:23] what M nervet told me to do everything I
[07:56:26] did I've done to protect them had I not
[07:56:28] they would be in Far More Dire Straits
[07:56:30] right now his grace knows it too right

[07:58:58] skip to whatever Patchi comes out in
[07:59:00] please take it easy in the meantime
[07:59:01] though what happened to
[07:59:04] femin wasn't he diving just outside of
[07:59:06] the Fortress why is he looking like like
[07:59:12] this these symptoms it can't
[07:59:15] be
[07:59:21] elzahar acceler elazar Al what is that
[07:59:23] called I don't know primordial seawater
[07:59:26] oh
[07:59:27] [ __ ] what did you
[07:59:30] say please make some space I'll need to
[07:59:33] give Mr f a more thorough checkup Your
[07:59:36] Grace I'll leave the rest to you I'll
[07:59:39] talk to cland while you get fine to

[07:59:52] sick I don't know I'm
[08:00:06] excited no what's that look face I
[08:00:10] thought I made good time on the way
[08:00:13] back oh I'm just admiring your
[08:00:15] punctuality had you arrived just a few
[08:00:18] minutes later sewe may have been forced
[08:00:20] to shoot Mr Linny
[08:00:29] again how's the situation out
[08:00:32] there the water has changed it's pretty
[08:00:35] much as expected the concentration of
[08:00:37] primordial seawat has increased
[08:00:39] significantly I was only out there a
[08:00:41] short time so it wasn't too bad but if
[08:00:44] one were to stay for any significant
[08:00:45] amount of time
[08:00:47] well you can see how that boy is doing
[08:00:50] where was he when you found
[08:00:53] him the abandoned Zone at the end of the
[08:00:55] pipes a good distance into the water
[08:00:58] closer than I thought he must have
[08:01:01] recognized it early on and tried
[08:01:02] desperately to swim back locking the
[08:01:05] door was necessary I don't think we
[08:01:07] could have saved two well I did try to
[08:01:09] convince him that I had my
[08:01:11] reasons never seems to work though it
[08:01:14] would probably work on net he has a
[08:01:16] knack for picking out who had good
[08:01:18] intentions even when the outcomes were
[08:01:20] all
[08:01:21] terrible it's a bad sign if you're
[08:01:24] having to plead your case to noet want
[08:01:26] some
[08:01:28] tea what the why did he transition to
[08:01:30] want some yo RZ not particularly if you
[08:01:33] want to drink some that badly just say
[08:01:35] so fine I'd like to get some tea want me
[08:01:39] to get you a cup too since I've already
[08:01:40] made
[08:01:43] it might as well then I suppose actually
[08:01:46] do you have a towel I would like to dry
[08:01:48] my
[08:01:49] hair
[08:01:52] yo hey man can I have some tea too hey
[08:01:55] could I tempt you with some sugar for
[08:01:57] your tea I'm down no need okay no no
[08:02:00] sugar actually could I attempt you no
[08:02:05] need okay Chad do you think Clorinda
[08:02:07] will bless us do you think if I roll an
[08:02:09] artifact next her we'll get lucky please
[08:02:11] clend clend and rizzly like surely
[08:02:14] nothing can go wrong if CL
[08:02:23] lenn's expression looks disgusted it
[08:02:25] seems like he'd rather not have sieg win
[08:02:27] touched from an A still he didn't stop
[08:02:30] her Siege WIS examined from carefully
[08:02:32] she doesn't look too upset which is a
[08:02:33] good sign I hope for will be okay how is
[08:02:36] he these symptoms are probably caused by
[08:02:39] an acute ingestion of a large amount of
[08:02:41] primordial
[08:02:43] seawater still his condition is not
[08:02:45] critical
[08:02:47] of course it would be best if he stayed
[08:02:49] for further observation let's leave him
[08:02:51] here for now and move him to the
[08:02:53] infirmary once he's recovered a bit more
[08:02:56] sorry I am aware that the infirmary may
[08:02:59] not be your favorite place in the world
[08:03:01] at the moment we do only have a single
[08:03:04] clinic in the Fortress
[08:03:10] however why would he ingest a large
[08:03:12] amount of primordial sea water after
[08:03:14] leaving the Fortress how could that
[08:03:16] possibly happen please look after Mr f
[08:03:19] for the moment I'll go fetch some
[08:03:21] medicine and a respirator oh I'll bring
[08:03:24] this lyette back with me where is she
[08:03:27] how is she right now oh she just took a
[08:03:31] nap in an empty room after I
[08:03:32] tranquilized her if my calculations are
[08:03:35] correct she should also be waking up
[08:03:37] right around now you might not believe
[08:03:40] me but his grace and I some snacks and
[08:03:43] tea for
[08:03:45] her
[08:03:47] why'd you tranquilize
[08:03:49] Lynette Lynette would have
[08:03:52] cooperated she's not mean Lenny are you
[08:03:59] okay I'll be fine they're all here now
[08:04:03] don't worry about
[08:04:05] me are you sure you don't look all
[08:04:09] right my hands and feet are still a bit
[08:04:12] weak but that's probably just the
[08:04:15] residual effect of the tranquilizer shot
[08:04:18] I'm back
[08:04:19] [Music]
[08:04:20] everyone oh Lynette Lenny hi
[08:04:23] Lynette traveler Pon also okay I'm going
[08:04:27] to say it right now cuz we don't know

[08:04:31] fanette probably got ambushed betrayed
[08:04:33] pushed into the wrong area there's
[08:04:35] there's definitely something but if he
[08:04:37] didn't and he just drowned cuz he
[08:04:39] drowned as like the best diver with that
[08:04:41] being his only trait I will be so I spit

[08:13:00] there's no
[08:13:02] chests this is where the water starts
[08:13:06] okay Master child probably dived into
[08:13:09] the
[08:13:12] water oh I wasn't looking let me climb
[08:13:15] back back no I have to swim oh you can
[08:13:17] dive never mind just font
[08:13:19] down okay
[08:13:21] cool why does the from have his [ __ ]
[08:13:23] diving helmet on hello can you just put
[08:13:26] it on if he's going to dive cuz what if
[08:13:28] it's primordial Jade
[08:13:31] water the vegetation here is a bit more
[08:13:35] sparse these traces aren't natural a
[08:13:38] person must have left them and reach
[08:13:40] he's getting pickled there
[08:13:44] are is there might be a hidden chest
[08:13:46] over here Dam if there was you guys have
[08:13:49] been like pre-at okay there's none the
[08:13:51] traces are gone but I don't see where he
[08:13:54] could have gone from
[08:13:58] here wait what
[08:14:03] the
[08:14:07] what my heart is racing and it's getting
[08:14:11] harder and harder to breathe what's
[08:14:14] going on
[08:14:18] no good I have to get back they still
[08:14:22] don't know anything about what's going
[08:14:24] on if I turn back right now I should
[08:14:28] still be able to make
[08:14:35] it return to shore quickly what if I
[08:14:37] don't what if I stall do I die what
[08:14:40] happens if I try to go
[08:14:44] forward okay

[08:14:48] checking our our health is going down
[08:14:51] wait can I use food it would be so funny
[08:14:52] if you can wait let me
[08:14:55] see wait we can just use food what the
[08:14:59] [ __ ]
[08:15:03] okay no yo I'm
[08:15:06] dying okay we're
[08:15:10] fine I can't wait this guy if he brought

[08:15:18] this this is bad I'm feeling worse and
[08:15:22] worse and I'm still
[08:15:26] underwater I have to push
[08:15:34] on yo why is chlorin
[08:15:40] here hello clarent can we get to PL
[08:15:43] clarent PL clarent dive glorian
[08:15:51] please so in other words the trail you
[08:15:54] were following vanished and you had no
[08:15:57] idea where Master child could have gone
[08:15:59] but there was also no obvious place for
[08:16:01] him to have disappeared to mhm that's
[08:16:04] right I tried my best to swim back but I
[08:16:08] had already put some distance between
[08:16:09] myself and the Fortress and I just bro I
[08:16:12] get that the water was like bad or
[08:16:14] whatever I but why didn't he just put
[08:16:16] his diver mask on some time after that
[08:16:18] is that his whole thing and you know the
[08:16:22] rest
[08:16:24] moon thanks the four months Hydro the
[08:16:26] nine months I even I the tier
[08:16:32] one miss cland brought you back but we
[08:16:35] also don't know why she just suddenly
[08:16:37] appeared at The Fortress or why she went
[08:16:39] out to save
[08:16:41] you that wouldn't do anything it would
[08:16:44] still touch his skin
[08:16:45] I
[08:16:46] see wait but can't you just be a Pro
[08:16:48] Diver okay this is like this is just me
[08:16:50] being a Hinds side hary so ignore it but
[08:16:52] can't if you're like okay can't okay
[08:16:54] can't you just go diver gear and then
[08:16:56] you have your own air tank and then
[08:16:57] you're not like your skin is full of
[08:16:59] like like latex or like whatever the
[08:17:01] [ __ ] your suit is no okay I don't know

[08:17:17] Miss Lynette is right I Believe Miss
[08:17:20] flan will stay here you think they let
[08:17:21] him bring his diving gear in prison yes
[08:17:23] the [ __ ] they do look they're wearing
[08:17:25] their literal outfits his entire outfit
[08:17:28] is diving his idle animation puts it on

[08:17:33] child was in full [ __ ] foule fit
[08:17:36] guess so is Lenny look at him he has
[08:17:37] [ __ ] cards the who invited her to

[08:19:42] stabilized of course I wouldn't have
[08:19:45] left the infirmary otherwise I've been
[08:19:47] expecting those two but might I inquire
[08:19:49] as to the purpose of your visit Miss
[08:19:52] seen I wanted to check up on Miss claran
[08:19:55] how are you feeling mostly fine I
[08:19:59] think if you don't mind I'd like to
[08:20:02] perform another quick physical exam
[08:20:04] it'll just take a few minutes all right
[08:20:07] thank you for looking out for me I'll
[08:20:10] take my leave she do not need you little
[08:20:11] bro well want to explain yourself Risley
[08:20:17] of course but I'm not partial to the
[08:20:19] word choice of
[08:20:21] explain how about Enlighten okay please
[08:20:25] enlighten us then where should I
[08:20:27] begin how about you start by asking me
[08:20:30] any questions you have you can start
[08:20:32] with whichever one you'd like to get
[08:20:33] answered the
[08:20:35] most then Pon will begin did you know
[08:20:38] about Lenny's goals from the very
[08:20:40] beginning no I just knew they were
[08:20:42] fouille operatives sent to the Fortress
[08:20:44] by the Nave as for their specific goals
[08:20:48] I only figured those out as you made
[08:20:50] progress on your investigation you
[08:20:52] managed to Monitor and stay ahead of
[08:20:54] them even though you didn't know what
[08:20:55] they were trying to do they came here
[08:20:58] with ulterior motives I'm quite Adept at
[08:21:01] Discerning what that kind of behavior
[08:21:03] signals why didn't you stop them
[08:21:05] initially I thought their goal was just
[08:21:06] to investigate child's disappearance
[08:21:09] Lenny suggested that I had deliberately
[08:21:11] let him Escape but in truth I didn't
[08:21:13] really do anything special to to help or
[08:21:15] hinder him while he was here everything
[08:21:17] he did from finding helpers to leaving
[08:21:19] this place he did on his own BR what the
[08:21:21] [ __ ] is not looking at that the Nave
[08:21:23] would make a big deal fellow harbinger's
[08:21:26] unexplained
[08:21:28] disappearance I'm also quite curious
[08:21:30] about where that Harbinger went so I
[08:21:33] figured I might as well let the fouille
[08:21:34] do their own investigative work oh did
[08:21:37] iect what did I do so you were hoping
[08:21:40] Lenny's group would just do your work
[08:21:42] for
[08:21:43] you you make it sound sound like that's
[08:21:45] a bad thing unfortunately things didn't
[08:21:48] go as planned I assume that F has told
[08:21:50] you already the ratio of primordial
[08:21:52] seawater around the Fortress of mpede is
[08:21:54] on the rise the forbidden zone has
[08:21:57] always been Lenny's Target and you got
[08:21:58] roped into that investigation after
[08:22:00] running into him I began to intervene
[08:22:02] out of concern for your safety and also
[08:22:05] to prevent The Fortress from becoming
[08:22:06] entangled in more irksome matters are
[08:22:10] the rumors true that you're also a
[08:22:12] former
[08:22:13] criminal what why would you put it like
[08:22:15] that isn't staying here all day and
[08:22:18] serving as the manager of the Fortress a
[08:22:20] kind of sentence unto itself another
[08:22:22] form of prison I just happen to have
[08:22:24] some support from the rest of the
[08:22:26] inmates that's all oh right am I want to
[08:22:29] me of course [ __ ] who invited Claren me
[08:22:31] I her good MOA to come down to the
[08:22:33] Fortress for some field workor okay
[08:22:35] based as a champion dualist Miss Claren
[08:22:37] could be considered to be an independent
[08:22:39] party I needed to find an exceptionally
[08:22:41] capable person to help me get through
[08:22:43] the crisis
[08:22:45] and saving F was part of that crisis you
[08:22:49] can think of it like that yes credit
[08:22:51] where credit is due that boy is quite
[08:22:54] Adept at diving well clearly not were
[08:22:58] calm down he probably would have found
[08:22:59] the missing Harbinger
[08:23:03] already so the fer Zone really exists
[08:23:05] what's inside of it that's not something
[08:23:08] you should be asking after net only
[08:23:11] asked you to investigate child's
[08:23:13] whereabouts all drown it's not funny it
[08:23:15] is funny I mean I feel bad but it is
[08:23:18] fun someone can nearly drown in game and
[08:23:20] still be
[08:23:22] funny I don't want him to drown it's
[08:23:24] still funny though that the character
[08:23:26] who's the diver almost drowned I mean
[08:23:28] like I get it I get why it's still funny
[08:23:33] though all he need to prove is that the
[08:23:35] fen Zone had nothing to do with The
[08:23:36] harer Disappearance that to be clear now
[08:23:39] that you've spoken to
[08:23:41] Frome you drowned in Fontan okay why
[08:23:44] would you bring that up why would you
[08:23:45] bring that
[08:23:47] up why would you bring that
[08:23:50] up do you know who wouldn't have drowned
[08:23:53] kakomi cuz she's not from fontin so she
[08:23:55] doesn't she's not a [ __ ] fake and a
[08:23:57] fraud who can't swim in certain Waters
[08:23:59] she could swim in any water and walk on
[08:24:02] it
[08:24:04] true but we've already uncovered that
[08:24:07] there's something wrong with the
[08:24:08] infirmary and we've answered a bunch of
[08:24:11] questions that you threw at us isn't it
[08:24:13] about time that you answer our last
[08:24:14] question and return yeah make a
[08:24:16] compelling
[08:24:18] case do you really want to know the
[08:24:20] answer that badly yes Pon really wants
[08:24:22] to know even if the truth may not be
[08:24:25] pleasant uh-oh follow me oh no I mean
[08:24:32] yes
[08:24:34] oh no clar's gone s it's fine she'll be
[08:24:43] back
[08:24:47] yo there's a hidden door here and a
[08:24:50] whole basement behind it this is my
[08:24:52] stream setup I actually stream from ry's
[08:24:54] basement this is actually like the
[08:24:56] staircase that's the staircase I'm
[08:24:57] actually streaming yeah just so you know
[08:25:00] is the The Jig Is
[08:25:03] Up This is actually where my stream set
[08:25:05] up look you'll see look you'll see this
[08:25:07] my stream set up
[08:25:09] yep stand on the central plate wait is
[08:25:13] there a secret mechanism
[08:25:15] wao
[08:25:20] whoa once everyone had taken the
[08:25:22] positions on the circle plate it began
[08:25:25] to move
[08:25:27] downwards
[08:25:29] okay so this is the forbidden zone
[08:25:33] honestly for a place so well hidden pman
[08:25:36] sure doesn't see child never mind big
[08:25:40] door there are three such isolation
[08:25:42] gates in total generally speaking I'm
[08:25:45] the only one who's allowed to go inside
[08:25:47] hence the name forbidden zone am I
[08:25:51] correct to assume you're going to run on
[08:25:53] back and tell your little fouille
[08:25:54] friends everything they're not my
[08:25:56] friends man I my wasn't thinking of
[08:25:59] keeping anything from
[08:26:01] them well I advise you wait until
[08:26:04] actually I guess we're friends TR this
[08:26:06] you're right we're friends I'm sorry I'm
[08:26:07] sorry we're friends to tell
[08:26:12] them wait a second why why am I wait a
[08:26:15] second wait is this my build okay get me
[08:26:17] all fa if I get to play my own character
[08:26:20] yeah yeah we're going Jade cutter yep
[08:26:22] get me off
[08:26:26] fa this isn't a [ __ ] Z Jeff stream
[08:26:28] get me on a real weapon so there's a
[08:26:30] switch on the side stand
[08:26:41] back why are you gearing dude shut one
[08:26:44] by one what's in the middle of that room
[08:26:47] have a look you guys think I could be
[08:26:49] rizzly no who am I
[08:26:54] kidding okay that
[08:26:58] was this room is also empty another here
[08:27:01] there TR on its own there's also a
[08:27:03] device smacked out in the middle of the
[08:27:04] room interested in what lies beyond that
[08:27:05] gate ever since I assumed leadership of
[08:27:07] the Fortress of mpede of course it would
[08:27:10] be unwise to recklessly open it but it'
[08:27:13] also be risky and NE negligent to Simply
[08:27:15] ignore any potential danger that could
[08:27:17] be behind it the readings on that
[08:27:19] dashboard have not budged since the day
[08:27:21] when I first laid eyes on this place but
[08:27:24] over the past year the needle has crept
[08:27:26] upwards from its original position
[08:27:28] likely because some parameter it's been
[08:27:30] tracking has changed if only
[08:27:32] infinitesimally
[08:27:34] infinites but I happen to have some
[08:27:36] thisy big words so I
[08:27:39] investigated any guesses what the
[08:27:41] reading could be
[08:27:43] tracking
[08:27:46] the pressure very reasonable guesses
[08:27:49] I've considered both of those as well
[08:27:52] unfortunately our dashboard is tracking
[08:27:54] something less ordinary the temperature
[08:27:56] should vary with weather and climate
[08:27:58] changes so for something that rarely
[08:28:00] climate change genin G woke I'm sorry we
[08:28:03] ran a few tests to increase the pressure
[08:28:05] from the outside the readings didn't
[08:28:07] change at all later on a few more
[08:28:09] possibilities occurred to me such as a
[08:28:11] potential connection with the primordial
[08:28:13] sea I began to make a few preparations
[08:28:16] based on that
[08:28:17] hypothesis the past few days the needle
[08:28:19] has moved again with that and the
[08:28:21] symptoms that FR displayed after leaving
[08:28:24] the Fortress I can now confidently
[08:28:26] conclude that the readings represent the
[08:28:28] concentration of primordial seawat in
[08:28:30] the seawater nearby the concentration of
[08:28:34] I mean that makes sense yeah there's
[08:28:35] more Primal sea water but we're already
[08:28:38] under the sea and that is precisely the
[08:28:41] problem under the
[08:28:43] sea yo I want to play that one sec Sea
[08:28:47] Under the primordial sea got mixed in
[08:28:49] and the concentration is steadily
[08:29:02] Rising dmca oh [ __ ] you're right
[08:29:05] actually I can't play it okay whatever
[08:29:07] and that's precisely the problem we're
[08:29:09] at the bottom of the sea and now we're
[08:29:10] surrounded by toxic sea water somehow
[08:29:11] primordial sea water got mixed in and
[08:29:13] the concentration is steadily Rising
[08:29:16] primordial seawat is continually leaking
[08:29:18] into the sea question mark yes but
[08:29:20] forget about the two of us not even noet
[08:29:23] knows where the primordial sea could be
[08:29:25] much less where we could find a plug a
[08:29:27] Le
[08:29:28] oh oh seems like You' figured it out I
[08:29:32] believe the primordial sea lies directly
[08:29:35] beneath this slle gate for some reason
[08:29:38] the primordial seawater levels have
[08:29:39] risen significantly and it's now very
[08:29:42] close to us the indic ators are now red
[08:29:45] although the gate still stands some
[08:29:47] primordial seawat has already leaked out
[08:29:49] and mixed into the sea around us can't
[08:29:51] you test it continues just truck someone
[08:29:53] we don't
[08:29:54] like soon it will no longer be able to
[08:29:57] yo get Reckless no he's not from F I was
[08:29:59] going to say l but L's a homie I don't
[08:30:01] know just get someone from Fontan that
[08:30:03] you don't like like a
[08:30:05] criminal and if the primordial C is
[08:30:07] leaking
[08:30:09] through if this gate Falls all of font
[08:30:11] will fall with
[08:30:13] it yeah you know what the Legends say if
[08:30:16] this place Falls then everyone in
[08:30:18] Fontaine will be turned into puddles in
[08:30:19] the span of a night but that's just too
[08:30:23] weird why would the Fortress of mpede be
[08:30:26] built right above a SLO gate for the
[08:30:28] primordial sea who built this place
[08:30:31] anyway good question expression tells me
[08:30:33] you think this might be part of a vast
[08:30:35] complicated
[08:30:36] conspiracy to be honest you might find
[08:30:39] the actual answer may be exceeding chat
[08:30:41] Pepa Pon I guess that was a bad question
[08:30:43] I'm had been long forgotten by the
[08:30:45] nation before actually don't know who
[08:30:47] buil thisch there's no single founder of
[08:30:49] the Fortress of Mar in any traditional
[08:30:52] sense what we know about its history has
[08:30:54] been Left To Us by the people who used
[08:30:56] to live here sure when the previous
[08:30:58] Hydro archon aeria Ruled the Land
[08:31:00] Nigeria all convicted criminals from
[08:31:01] Fontaine were exiled the people the
[08:31:05] criminals away like a Wolfpack chasing
[08:31:07] away the banished if I Google aeria will
[08:31:09] I get spoilers who the [ __ ]
[08:31:12] is lur skipper did they talk about aeria
[08:31:15] before yes okay I w't look it up the
[08:31:17] hell wait a second Nita let me call
[08:31:21] Nita n hello yeah I just learn about the
[08:31:24] previous Hydra archon aeria I'm
[08:31:26] wondering do you know anything about a
[08:31:27] previous dendro archon no does like uh
[08:31:30] Ruka Dada ring a
[08:31:32] bell he is dead sorry that was I
[08:31:35] wouldn't do that okay aeria all
[08:31:38] convicted criminals were exiled he will
[08:31:40] drove the criminals by way like a wolf
[08:31:42] pack Wolf the criminals receive no he
[08:31:46] isn't dead no she's not but if you if
[08:31:48] you mention Rada desolate Seaside where
[08:31:50] they experienced only pain so don't
[08:31:52] mention it and the chilling
[08:31:57] cold apologize I'm sorry I like
[08:32:07] Nita some of them began to repent repent
[08:32:10] and prayed to the hydro archon asking if
[08:32:12] there was still anything they could
[08:32:14] do the hydro archon took pity on them
[08:32:18] and said you may go guard my secret deep
[08:32:21] underneath the waves and so leaning on
[08:32:25] the power of the hydro archon they
[08:32:27] gathered underneath the sea and began to
[08:32:29] build a fortress they became a community
[08:32:32] down there in the deeps and over the
[08:32:34] years helped it to grow as the number of
[08:32:36] Exiles increased more and more people
[08:32:38] joined the community when the first
[08:32:41] group of Exiles died they left the yet
[08:32:43] unfinished Fortress to their
[08:32:46] successors the hydro archon continued to
[08:32:49] lend her support allowing The Fortress
[08:32:51] and what it stood for to continue
[08:32:53] growing ever
[08:32:54] larger before long this dark underwater
[08:32:57] Fortress became the sinner's only home
[08:33:00] and with that the people here stopped
[08:33:03] referring to the Fortress as a prison
[08:33:05] they saw themselves as repenting Sinners
[08:33:07] who would regain their freedom once they
[08:33:09] had sufficiently redeemed themselves But
[08:33:11] as time went on people also so realized
[08:33:14] that the Fortress was a lonely Place
[08:33:17] once they had gotten used to life here
[08:33:19] they could no longer feel comfortable
[08:33:20] living in the Overworld once they had
[08:33:23] finished serving their sentences some
[08:33:24] people left and some others chose to
[08:33:26] stay they'd find some idle position and
[08:33:29] let their withered Souls fade away with
[08:33:31] the ancient secrets of the Past after
[08:33:33] many many centuries few people still
[08:33:36] remember the reason for the Fortress Is
[08:33:38] founding now they just see it as an
[08:33:40] integral pillar of Fontan society as the
[08:33:43] place where criminals deserve to be sent
[08:33:46] now and again researchers managed to
[08:33:48] break one law or another and live out
[08:33:50] their days in the Fortress I learned all
[08:33:53] this from an elderly historian everyone
[08:33:56] else just thought what if he did make
[08:33:57] make it up and then just believe them
[08:33:59] every part of that history is true never
[08:34:01] mind
[08:34:03] indeed that's just as the prophecy says
[08:34:06] you believe in prophecies if to be frank
[08:34:08] not
[08:34:09] really but sadly that hasn't stopped
[08:34:11] this Prophecy from proving all too
[08:34:12] accurate
[08:34:14] prophecies are Troublesome things just
[08:34:16] hearing one will create the first wave
[08:34:18] of panic seeing signs of it will bring
[08:34:20] about the second and actually witnessing
[08:34:22] it in real time the
[08:34:26] third so as the Duke of meped just what
[08:34:29] do you plan to do about it let's go
[08:34:30] somewhere else I want to show you okay
[08:34:33] stay here Pon
[08:34:40] sorry sorry chat if I looked to my other
[08:34:42] monitor a lot it's the shooting star I'm
[08:34:44] mining reset so I have to click
[08:34:46] somewhere else I us have to do it like
[08:34:47] once an hour so it's not that big of a
[08:34:49] deal wait Jor he's not alone oh it's
[08:34:52] these two again huh line and
[08:34:56] Jor no need to panic you two no need to
[08:35:00] panic you two what after you warned us
[08:35:03] not to tell a single soul about any of
[08:35:05] this someone wrot Gage but different
[08:35:08] gender how is this
[08:35:12] Gage
[08:35:16] I mean maybe but the results speak for
[08:35:19] themselves don't they these two may
[08:35:21] already know more than you could ever
[08:35:23] imagine all right then if your grace
[08:35:26] insists they seem harmless enough so
[08:35:29] I'll trust them for
[08:35:31] now [ __ ] my cosplay just how about some
[08:35:33] introductions this is juor one of the
[08:35:36] highest ranked researchers from the
[08:35:37] Fontaine Research Institute he used to
[08:35:39] work under Edwin I trust that you've
[08:35:42] heard of Edwin Edwin van CLE the [ __ ]
[08:35:45] the
[08:35:47] Rogue he's the one who blew the whole
[08:35:50] Institute Sky High everyone knew he was
[08:35:53] a bit crooked in the head but you're not
[08:35:55] a local so I guess it's possible for you
[08:35:58] not to have heard of him Ed why does he
[08:36:00] talk like that Chad do I sound like him
[08:36:02] be honest as his assistant Jer is with
[08:36:06] them as well I hired him to be my
[08:36:08] technical consultant you you want to
[08:36:12] blow up The Fortress of mared ah what a
[08:36:16] lovely idea what the yo what the [ __ ]
[08:36:20] Alo got to admit un ad guys focus
[08:36:27] focus that Taskmaster over there is Miss
[08:36:30] lorine and is also one of my technical
[08:36:32] consultants while jerrier used to be
[08:36:34] Edwin's assistant she used to be jer's
[08:36:37] assistant okay are they together Pon
[08:36:41] what the [ __ ] see everyone keep asking
[08:36:44] this question are you too sure you're
[08:36:45] not a couple and just using your work as
[08:36:47] a actually Canon I you're Grace I am not
[08:36:53] in a relationship with this man if I
[08:36:56] dated her I'd officially be madder than
[08:36:58] Edwin why does he sound like that
[08:37:02] dude if I dated her I'd officially be
[08:37:05] mad than Edwin jeez forget I said
[08:37:08] anything then follow me yes sir w
[08:37:13] there's another door that goes right up
[08:37:16] your constant amazement makes it seem
[08:37:18] like the Fortress can do
[08:37:23] anything but Pon really thinks
[08:37:26] everything's super
[08:37:29] cool is this just a normal
[08:37:33] room wait till you see
[08:37:35] this and here you
[08:37:39] go yo yo yo what's about what a
[08:37:44] huge B ship this is also a production
[08:37:48] Zone that P's never seen before what's
[08:37:51] going on how much do you know about
[08:37:53] fonan history I don't I don't know not
[08:37:56] much why the [ __ ] would I learn about
[08:37:58] [ __ ] font you haven't heard the story
[08:38:00] of ancient
[08:38:01] lamura to give you a quick rundown
[08:38:04] Fontaine used to be ruled by the luran
[08:38:06] dynasty according to Legend the luran
[08:38:09] king Reus came to this land after being
[08:38:12] inspired by divine revelation and found
[08:38:15] the Seer saila who had taken on the form
[08:38:17] of a golden bee taking the Golden Bee
[08:38:20] with him and riding on a huge ship the
[08:38:23] Fortuna he created his Nation above the
[08:38:25] surging waves okay will this be on the
[08:38:27] will this be on the test called his
[08:38:28] Nation lamura okay and used the Fortuna
[08:38:31] to incessantly search for new tribes and
[08:38:33] Islands calling on them to join his
[08:38:36] Empire there's a ship in the story
[08:38:39] too where there's water there'll be
[08:38:41] ships people believe hope can always be
[08:38:44] found at the end of a voyage do you
[08:38:46] believe that to a point I think as
[08:38:49] you've already seen I have a whole
[08:38:51] Factory's worth of labor materials and
[08:38:53] Technology at my disposal certainly
[08:38:56] can't hurt to give it a try so the
[08:38:58] moment I began to speculate that the
[08:38:59] primordial seam might lie underneath the
[08:39:01] gate I also began this project were you
[08:39:05] inspired by the legendary
[08:39:07] Fortuna maybe fontans need something to
[08:39:11] hold on to to cope with the
[08:39:14] disaster true this is a plan for the
[08:39:16] ages why can't you share it with
[08:39:17] everyone wait they literally rebuilt
[08:39:19] Noah's Arc the workers to find out the
[08:39:21] truth behind this ship riots would
[08:39:23] destroy the Fortress faster than any
[08:39:25] catastrophe as the fortress's
[08:39:27] administrator I'd never make is Noah all
[08:39:31] right that's enough talking for now I'll
[08:39:33] need another three cups of tea to soothe
[08:39:35] my throat do you have any other
[08:39:37] questions chy why does your throat hurt
[08:39:39] so much seems like you're good come on
[08:39:41] I'll take you back
[08:39:52] I'll leave you here oh uh thank you no
[08:39:56] worries but don't forget I likez whether
[08:39:59] or not you want to share what you just
[08:40:01] saw what you do from here on out will
[08:40:03] likely affect those three as
[08:40:05] well he means that my actions now will
[08:40:07] decide the next steps Lenny's group
[08:40:09] takes wait actually decisions matter in
[08:40:12] gen
[08:40:14] yeah we'll put a lot of thought into it
[08:40:16] for sure yes we will I look yes
[08:40:19] decisions matter surely surely it wasn't
[08:40:23] just it actually means decision matter
[08:40:24] please act for complete act for complete
[08:40:28] act
[08:40:36] behold we're back welcome back do you
[08:40:40] want a cup of tea why does everyone keep
[08:40:42] offering me tea so much like Risley
[08:40:44] always drinking tea huh actually now
[08:40:48] that you mention it I just remembered
[08:40:50] something now while I was sedated I
[08:40:53] could still barely hear two people
[08:40:55] talking next to me they were discussing
[08:40:58] everything from the leaves to the water
[08:41:01] and even the teacups themselves must
[08:41:04] have been risle and seen what if it's
[08:41:07] cold yeah I heard one male voice and one
[08:41:11] female so it should have should have
[08:41:13] been the two of them they really were
[08:41:16] just talking about brewing tea I really
[08:41:19] can't make sense of this place so
[08:41:22] traveler Pimon were you able to learn
[08:41:25] anything from Risley yeah he explained
[08:41:27] everything very well then would you mind
[08:41:31] checking your answers against my
[08:41:33] speculations feeling better now ly yeah
[08:41:36] I took the time to rest so I'm feeling a
[08:41:38] lot more relaxed now nobody else is
[08:41:41] around and Miss seen is also busy with
[08:41:43] something or other so let's just talk
[08:41:46] here all right then I'll posit my
[08:41:49] theories I asked myself three questions
[08:41:53] firstly why was fremin affected by the
[08:41:56] primordial seawater it was because he
[08:41:58] dove into the sea my theory is the long
[08:42:02] lost primordial SE BR we already figured
[08:42:04] that out like two cut scenes
[08:42:08] agoe okay good good theory W he's good
[08:42:12] that's our L secondly risley's attitude
[08:42:16] changed dramatically during the course
[08:42:17] of our stay here he ignored us
[08:42:19] completely at first then suddenly
[08:42:21] roadblocked us why I spent quite a long
[08:42:25] time thinking about this if he has been
[08:42:28] monitoring the foule since the very
[08:42:29] beginning he probably ignored us at
[08:42:32] first because he was hoping we could
[08:42:33] find master child for him what's more
[08:42:37] The Fortress of marpit is not part of
[08:42:39] fontaine's court system nor does it
[08:42:41] report to ud's nerv
[08:42:43] Risley is basically the king of No Man's
[08:42:46] Land as long as the Fortress doesn't do
[08:42:48] anything about master child's
[08:42:50] disappearance father can use it to
[08:42:52] pressure the Fontaine authorities and
[08:42:54] while the two factions are pitted
[08:42:56] against each other Risley will be free
[08:42:58] to move between the parties of interest
[08:43:01] if I had to guess he probably has
[08:43:03] something that he's working on himself
[08:43:06] it's likely related to The Secret of the
[08:43:08] infirmary but I just can't think of what
[08:43:11] it could be
[08:43:13] D Lenny Lenny was a cut scene Skipper
[08:43:15] but he he got a good he got a good he
[08:43:17] got a good read thanks so much then
[08:43:20] finally there's the last question if
[08:43:23] Risley does have a plan what could it be
[08:43:27] all I know for now is that his plan
[08:43:28] probably has something to do with the
[08:43:30] changing nature of the seawater he's
[08:43:32] even gotten choran to help him
[08:43:35] out the full extent of what he's doing
[08:43:38] there's probably a secret passageway
[08:43:40] behind the Block in the infirmary and
[08:43:42] there's something big in the Fortress
[08:43:44] that most people here never get to see
[08:43:46] he has a bargaining chip and it could be
[08:43:49] important enough her father to deal with
[08:43:50] him directly I don't have enough
[08:43:53] information so I have no idea it's a
[08:43:55] dragon Tru but he has let me guess you
[08:44:00] have the last piece of the puzzle well
[08:44:02] it's a ship but it could have been a
[08:44:07] dragon you emphasize that now is not the
[08:44:09] time for disputes it's very important to
[08:44:10] take the out I can't believe it the SE
[08:44:16] will engulf everyone yeah just like
[08:44:18] lightning just like the prophecy I know
[08:44:20] it's tragic man first engulfing
[08:44:21] lightning want to meet father to figure
[08:44:23] out a way to deal with this crisis if
[08:44:25] you remember I once mentioned that
[08:44:27] father sees the house of the Hearth as
[08:44:29] her base of operations and she truly
[08:44:31] wants to resolve the crisis but how
[08:44:34] could Risley have known that or perhaps
[08:44:37] he didn't know and just wanted to bring
[08:44:39] father over to his side which could be
[08:44:41] why he said he just wanted to
[08:44:43] negotiate yeah that makes sense to me I
[08:44:47] understand your concerns as well
[08:44:49] traveler I'll figure out a way to pass
[08:44:51] this on to our father no matter what
[08:44:53] we're on your
[08:44:55] side the two of you have already aided
[08:44:58] us far too much we probably wouldn't be

[08:48:42] being nice I would like this character

[08:48:46] six sentences she said strong and

[08:48:51] also sealed the pipes after curan left
[08:48:54] to make sure that Lenny wouldn't
[08:48:55] impulsively chase after his brother
[08:48:58] although the path was blocked we still
[08:49:00] stationed some guards there to stop

[09:00:11] for tea when we had the
[09:00:14] time I like her colors I like the like
[09:00:17] black white red I guess that's gray not
[09:00:20] white ah it's white
[09:00:24] gray her hands aren't gloves by the way
[09:00:27] yeah I remember hearing that which is
[09:00:29] actually pretty
[09:00:32] sick see this this is a limited type of
[09:00:36] confectioner that Miss finina simply
[09:00:38] Ador there are only 16 I is sold every
[09:00:42] day here why don't you and Pon have a
[09:00:49] taste she seems friendly enough but that
[09:00:51] can't be all there is her the na is a
[09:00:52] force to be reckoned with I should be
[09:00:53] very
[09:00:54] cautious I mean we're basically best
[09:00:56] friends with child and he's a [ __ ]
[09:00:58] fatou so we're chilling traveler what do
[09:01:00] you think of this cake also wanderer's

[09:01:07] friends it's pretty
[09:01:09] good that's good to hear here so what
[09:01:12] child said was on the mark after all you
[09:01:15] do share a taste in desserts with finina
[09:01:18] and
[09:01:20] I wonder is redacted I mean oh I wasn't
[09:01:25] listening that's good to hear so what
[09:01:27] child said was on the mark after all you
[09:01:28] do share a taste in desserts wait Chach
[09:01:31] know have no reason to have said
[09:01:32] something like that I wonder how he's
[09:01:33] doing
[09:01:34] nowadays you must have heard right he's
[09:01:38] suddenly gone
[09:01:39] missing I'm really worried about his
[09:01:42] safety you know here's to hoping that
[09:01:45] he's an excellent
[09:01:48] swimmer I have faith in his abilities
[09:01:50] but if he's not a good swimmer and you
[09:01:52] need someone just to replace him uh
[09:01:54] since we talking about him I feel like I
[09:01:57] should add something his Marshall
[09:01:59] prowess really looked certainly pretty
[09:02:03] impressive
[09:02:04] [Music]
[09:02:09] yeah uhoh dude fina's face she looks so
[09:02:12] worried look at her poor
[09:02:16] finina you okay finina you need a hug oh
[09:02:19] so you are also familiar with his
[09:02:21] aptitude for fighting Miss
[09:02:24] finina oh right I almost forgot child
[09:02:28] was subdued by udex nuet right in front
[09:02:30] of you against Ordinary People my
[09:02:33] colleague would never be on the back
[09:02:35] foot but alas he just never imagined
[09:02:38] he'd run into such a person
[09:02:42] H I must express my admiration for mons
[09:02:46] nuet I manag to find a few leads H
[09:02:50] coming from you that's not surprising at
[09:02:56] all uh but I thought you would be
[09:02:59] happier to hear the news of course but
[09:03:02] it's still a bit of a shame you see I
[09:03:05] would have been far happier had I
[09:03:07] received this news somewhat earlier as
[09:03:10] you well know
[09:03:11] a long time has passed since child
[09:03:17] disappeared yo is she okay well in any
[09:03:20] case there's no need to worry we know
[09:03:22] for sure that child is still alive oh
[09:03:26] and just how do you know
[09:03:29] that
[09:03:30] because uh because we found evidence
[09:03:33] that proved he left the Fortress of
[09:03:35] mpede and where did he go after leaving
[09:03:38] the
[09:03:39] Fortress well
[09:03:45] The Fortress of meped Lies deep beneath
[09:03:48] the waves unless he pranced right at
[09:03:50] he's in the abyss we saw the trailer I
[09:03:52] saw skirk in the trailer he's in the
[09:03:54] abyss I'm sorry I'm sorry I saw the
[09:03:56] trailer I saw the
[09:03:58] [Music]
[09:04:01] trailer but there was also no evidence
[09:04:03] he's been injured or killed spoil did
[09:04:05] trailers always spoil you man it's like
[09:04:07] I was watching a fast and furious movie
[09:04:09] like 5 years ago and before the movie I
[09:04:11] saw a trailer that had an airplane
[09:04:13] [ __ ] driving on a railway like a road
[09:04:15] like a like a road and then I was like
[09:04:17] bro the movie was like going to end I
[09:04:18] was like wait I haven't seen the
[09:04:20] airplane Yet the movie can't end and
[09:04:22] then surely enough plot twizz is a
[09:04:24] [ __ ] airplane sorry trailers suck
[09:04:27] limbo The Raid I appreciate but there
[09:04:29] was no evidence that he's been injured
[09:04:31] or
[09:04:32] killed that is good news at least his
[09:04:35] sister Tonia sent a letter to not too
[09:04:37] long ago I knew that I knew that

[09:08:31] it is not this
[09:08:34] day this ancient power could easily
[09:08:37] obliterate an entire race

[09:09:25] guess we're safe for
[09:09:29] now indeed but only for now I win this
[09:09:35] bet you owe me a
[09:09:37] present why' they have a bet very well
[09:09:41] it was indeed just as you said you made
[09:09:44] a
[09:09:46] bet we made a bet on the size of your
[09:09:49] entourage goren thought you size of
[09:09:51] never Entourage probably like uh I mean
[09:09:54] like 12 in well we saw the Hy when you
[09:09:56] charge tax it's like sure it's probably
[09:09:59] about no it's more than 12 it's like
[09:10:00] about 18 I don't know I figured you
[09:10:03] would have at least brought a few people
[09:10:05] along for appearance's sake it appears I
[09:10:08] underestimated just how confidential the
[09:10:10] mission was shouldn't you have gotten
[09:10:12] used to confidential missions by now
[09:10:15] that's just how the courts
[09:10:16] operate so what gift must the loser give
[09:10:22] tea he already has tons of tea in his
[09:10:25] office I'm thinking about a set of legal
[09:10:28] codies that wouldn't happen to be a dig
[09:10:30] at my lack of legal awareness would
[09:10:33] it well I'm sure his grace doesn't
[09:10:36] consider the Fortress to be outside the
[09:10:39] law I was under the impression the
[09:10:41] residents of a place like this would be
[09:10:43] uninterested in the legal
[09:10:45] codes that was obviously a
[09:10:49] joke he did not he does not get the joke
[09:10:52] anyway you've still got some unfinished
[09:10:54] business to attend to in the Overworld
[09:10:56] correct no need to stay here if you have
[09:10:58] a pressing matter we all know you can't
[09:11:01] leave P mormonia for
[09:11:03] long thank you I hope everything went
[09:11:06] smoothly with the fouille
[09:11:08] harbinger uh-oh yeah about that uh yeah
[09:11:12] so
[09:11:13] finina she's having a tough time but
[09:11:15] she's pretty strong um like meta wise
[09:11:19] I'd recommend Nikita then finina then
[09:11:21] like Ryden jongi uh in terms of just
[09:11:24] like power-wise uh for your account but
[09:11:27] I must say we've spent long enough
[09:11:29] Playing
[09:11:32] House
[09:11:35] house what about Kazo I was only talking
[09:11:37] about archons I'm must say we spent a
[09:11:39] lot of horse sir
[09:11:41] as the hydro archon I am sure you
[09:11:44] understand the exact meaning of the
[09:11:45] phenomenon we just
[09:11:47] witnessed or should I say that's what I
[09:11:50] originally thought but looking at your
[09:11:54] expression was I wrong and you haven't a
[09:11:58] clue okay listen here arino listen okay
[09:12:04] look listen I love you arino I do but
[09:12:08] you can't be bullying foro like that
[09:12:09] because then we'll have a problem okay
[09:12:11] let her be let her be a failure you
[09:12:14] don't have to listen okay why didn't she
[09:12:18] talk like this what are you trying to
[09:12:21] say she is right though this point I
[09:12:23] don't think there's any more need to
[09:12:24] speak as diplomatic
[09:12:26] Representatives allow me to speak to you
[09:12:28] now as just a
[09:12:30] Fontan you know the prophecy by heart
[09:12:33] falling apart also that every part of it
[09:12:35] is being proven
[09:12:38] true yet here you are relaxing drinking
[09:12:42] tea and eating desserts as if it's all
[09:12:45] nothing more than a few straight bugs in
[09:12:47] she but do you really think that's
[09:12:52] acceptable I mean true but like she's
[09:12:56] cute like you could be nicer to her the
[09:12:57] prophecy's hanging above our necks like
[09:12:59] a guillotine every faction is looking
[09:13:02] for a way to either avert the disaster
[09:13:04] or save their own even the Orphans of
[09:13:07] the House of the Heth have devoted
[09:13:09] everything to to saving their home life
[09:13:11] that's actually a France reference but
[09:13:14] you literally maret just how nonchalant
[09:13:17] and carefree you have [ __ ] Jan wait
[09:13:20] I'm Jean of Arc I'm literally Jan look
[09:13:23] at me you have utterly F my cosplay is

[09:14:01] for a man like me a mammoth like me so
[09:14:04] obviously the shorts they're not going
[09:14:06] to be as long as I am tall cuz I'm
[09:14:08] [ __ ] 6'8
[09:14:15] I actually did it's actually like it
[09:14:17] literally hurts
[09:14:19] the but from you sorry I got distracted
[09:14:22] it Beggars belief how nonchalant and
[09:14:24] carefree you have been from the very
[09:14:26] beginning you the God falor you have
[09:14:29] utterly failed to take action you're
[09:14:32] wrong I've never ignored the prophecy
[09:14:35] nor have I just been passing the time in
[09:14:39] self-indulgence retract your accusation
[09:14:41] and stop doubting the wisdom of the Gods
[09:14:44] with such absurd
[09:14:47] conjectures I am not alone in my doubts
[09:14:50] you know all the children of Fontaine
[09:14:52] may be harboring the exact same thoughts
[09:14:54] right
[09:14:56] now Harbor I suggest you move dude shut
[09:15:00] the [ __ ] up Z sorry I'll let it play oh
[09:15:02] great Hydro
[09:15:04] Aron how are you going to save them save
[09:15:08] us how now are the people you've sworn
[09:15:11] to protect supposed to survive in a land
[09:15:13] that will soon disappear beneath the
[09:15:16] waves I have my ways and I've been
[09:15:20] working on them for all this time even
[09:15:24] if you look down upon me you have no
[09:15:27] right to judge me true Fontaine will be
[09:15:31] saved it will be even even if I still
[09:15:35] cannot see the true future right now as
[09:15:38] long as I continue on as I am I will be
[09:15:42] able to hold my head up high I mean
[09:15:46] that's not really the point they're
[09:15:47] talking about like the prophecy of the
[09:15:48] nation is not about
[09:15:50] your
[09:15:52] I so true Queen fr's not her usual self
[09:15:55] she's actually
[09:15:56] Serina just what have you been working
[09:15:59] where can we see it and what is it doing
[09:16:02] to
[09:16:03] help oh no yo net sent us here to
[09:16:07] protect her why are we silent you mean
[09:16:11] talk is that all a lie or can she really
[09:16:13] not tell us she was so full of
[09:16:14] conviction and confidence just now but
[09:16:16] now she deflated like a pop balloon
[09:16:17] nette really said don't let finina talk
[09:16:20] I'm worried about hey the more she hey
[09:16:22] the more she talks the worse it is my
[09:16:25] mations are just like the prophecy
[09:16:28] itself they will only reveal themselves
[09:16:31] at the fated time it is just that beings
[09:16:35] like yourselves are unable to perceive
[09:16:38] them as of yet
[09:16:41] I see as a God the proof of your labor
[09:16:44] always lies Beyond prying mortal
[09:16:47] eyes yo allow me to be so bold as to ask
[09:16:51] another one yo someone screenshot that
[09:16:52] for me would it be possible for you to
[09:16:54] tell us the parts of your plan that are
[09:16:56] not confidential such as your emergency
[09:17:00] response plan for the impending
[09:17:02] disaster uh an emergency response plan
[09:17:07] no don't say lumine I'm I'm sorry not to
[09:17:10] Flame the main character but are you
[09:17:12] [ __ ] stupid just say something say
[09:17:15] something neveress a dragon what oh [ __ ]
[09:17:19] we have a defense system say
[09:17:21] something that look in your eyes have
[09:17:25] you not even prepared one of those the
[09:17:28] the emergency response plan is also
[09:17:31] strictly confidential true then allow me
[09:17:34] to jog your memory Miss finina what is
[09:17:38] the purpose of your orry mechanique
[09:17:40] denes Cardinal God not that again what
[09:17:42] do you plan to do with the massive
[09:17:44] amounts of indem nium that has
[09:17:46] accumulated over the
[09:17:49] years the orrice it it's just like it
[09:17:52] appears to
[09:17:53] be H so you also have no idea if I'm not
[09:17:59] mistaken someone's using it to prepare
[09:18:02] for something but unfortunately it would
[09:18:05] seem that someone is not you miss finina
[09:18:09] i f first caught wind of this when Linny
[09:18:11] tried to investigate the orrice in the
[09:18:13] Opera House you see even just getting
[09:18:16] close to the core contaminated him with
[09:18:19] an extremely large amount of indem nium
[09:18:22] but even if that had nothing to do with
[09:18:25] you then what could you possibly be
[09:18:28] working on oh great Hydro

[09:22:20] imagined why are you looking at me like
[09:22:22] that is something the matter if there's
[09:22:26] nothing urgent then I shall be retiring
[09:22:29] for
[09:22:32] now this where we met Navia there's like
[09:22:34] Navia silver Malo I remember how are
[09:22:36] they doing by the way sorry
[09:22:44] I'm glad that you were willing to come
[09:22:46] with me of course child was just an
[09:22:49] excuse I have no interest in your
[09:22:51] dealings with him that's what Pon
[09:22:54] thought child's cool though you lent
[09:22:57] your Aid to the children of the House of
[09:22:59] the Hearth as their father I would like
[09:23:03] to express my gratitude there's no
[09:23:08] need
[09:23:10] wait what I clicked on there's no need
[09:23:12] was there anything else you want to say
[09:23:13] that was all formal topics should be
[09:23:15] discussed in formal settings and
[09:23:17] informal topics and informal
[09:23:19] settings oh then informally just
[09:23:22] returned from The Fortress of meped
[09:23:25] relax I have no intention of trying to
[09:23:27] get anything out of you Linny Lynette
[09:23:30] and fremin are still there and I trust
[09:23:32] their judgment and abilities they've all
[09:23:35] been working very hard and have always
[09:23:37] done all they can to fight back against
[09:23:39] anyone who tried to stop them especially
[09:23:41] you mean rley he's a tricky one to deal
[09:23:46] with it's unfortunate that Linn is so
[09:23:49] eager to prove himself that he can't
[09:23:51] learn to rely on others including me by
[09:23:55] the way and you can just consider this a
[09:23:58] bit of idle gossip but what's your
[09:24:01] impression of finina listen AR like you
[09:24:03] know we need to go a bit easier on
[09:24:05] finina okay I get it she's a bit of a
[09:24:08] failure but it's like like in a cute way
[09:24:10] okay she's trying her best she's been
[09:24:12] through a lot okay look I get it but
[09:24:16] like it's like look we have to like you
[09:24:19] have to be a little nicer okay just like
[09:24:21] you don't have to be nice to me but but
[09:24:23] at least to her you are outside of our
[09:24:26] disputes and the freest person in all of
[09:24:29] Fontaine able to move around most easily
[09:24:33] allow me to share my perspective with
[09:24:36] you and that's everything that happened
[09:24:39] during the trial Master child was
[09:24:41] declared guilty and immediately
[09:24:43] transported to the Fortress of
[09:24:46] mared didn't he say he was coming here
[09:24:48] on vacation does he not feel an ounce of
[09:24:51] Shame for all the trouble he has
[09:24:54] caused I forget it he did give us an
[09:24:59] opportunity yo we'll be meeting someone
[09:25:02] short
[09:25:03] yo what's with yo what's her beef with
[09:25:05] them preparations no need I will take
[09:25:08] care care of it myself oh my god I
[09:25:10] didn't even notice she's using the T set
[09:25:11] that I got her for her birthday oh yes
[09:25:14] that's awesome you're welcome arino to
[09:25:17] meet with finina a hydro Aron she is the
[09:25:21] heart of Fontaine my bad CH but what's
[09:25:23] fascinating about her is that she often
[09:25:26] seems more like a celebrity than a
[09:25:29] working archon true she's a twitch
[09:25:31] streamer come over oh my [ __ ] is that
[09:25:38] yo
[09:25:43] how many Primo gems for this outfit how
[09:25:46] many say a number I will say my credit
[09:25:49] card information right
[09:25:51] now please give me this
[09:25:54] outfit I will do
[09:25:58] anything
[09:26:02] sorry I was just screenshotting
[09:26:05] it
[09:26:08] morow you dare to run from me stop right
[09:26:11] this instant yo yo it's a cat my goal is
[09:26:15] just to discover the location of the
[09:26:17] nois but I didn't expect the chance to
[09:26:20] approach finina to be handed to me on a
[09:26:22] silver
[09:26:23] platter this is so easy it's actually
[09:26:25] making me a bit
[09:26:27] suspicious anything left
[09:26:29] unguard just
[09:26:31] bait but wait but also what the [ __ ] is
[09:26:34] happening for taking the bait after all
[09:26:37] from the moment it was attached to the
[09:26:39] hook the bait is meant to be
[09:26:46] sacrificed it's just as I guessed in the
[09:26:49] second before I struck the hydrosis is
[09:26:52] not currently held by the
[09:26:56] archon first of
[09:26:58] all first of all would second of all
[09:27:02] what the [ __ ] did she try to kill her or
[09:27:05] try to get the [ __ ] yosis in fact
[09:27:08] this Arch doesn't seem like a god at all
[09:27:11] yo and I sense that she's under some
[09:27:14] kind of no she's my archon okay who are
[09:27:18] you and and what are you trying to do
[09:27:22] please don't kill me I'm begging you
[09:27:27] please the fear in her pupils is genuine
[09:27:30] so perhaps she's not bait after all
[09:27:33] either way targeting her has lost all
[09:27:37] meaning I left the scene with ease
[09:27:41] nobody came looking for me and nobody
[09:27:43] could serve as a witness to my near
[09:27:45] assassination of
[09:27:46] falor I suspect even Vina dares not
[09:27:50] mention this incident to anyone tell my
[09:27:54] informants confirmed what I had guessed
[09:27:56] after returning to her quarters finina
[09:27:58] quietly cried alone she was so scared
[09:28:02] that she could not sleep that night nor
[09:28:04] could she even bring herself to eat her
[09:28:06] cake there's no doubt that there there's
[09:28:09] something wrong with her I began to
[09:28:11] entertain the possibility that she is
[09:28:13] not the true Hydro
[09:28:15] archon perhaps udc's net is actually the
[09:28:20] genuine article I have to find the nosis
[09:28:24] wait a second that's literally what I
[09:28:26] said like 5 minutes ago but I can't be
[09:28:28] true probably in possession of it
[09:28:30] alternatively it might have been hidden
[09:28:33] in a place that's hard for ordinary
[09:28:34] people to access did you see the cut
[09:28:36] scene did you see the cut whoa
[09:28:39] my dear children where did they come
[09:28:40] from please
[09:28:42] speak did she see the cut scene that we
[09:28:44] just saw Master cuz I was my reaction
[09:28:47] child has gone missing on top of that
[09:28:50] the contacts and guards we bried at The
[09:28:51] Fortress have all gone quiet as
[09:28:54] well probably the handiwork of that ride
[09:28:58] slee I'm afraid
[09:29:01] so this is a good opportunity the value
[09:29:05] of a Harbinger is much higher than most
[09:29:07] would imagine we now have an excuse to
[09:29:10] exert diplomatic pressure on the
[09:29:12] Fontaine
[09:29:16] authorities set up a meeting for me I
[09:29:18] would like to meet the hydro archon and
[09:29:21] udex
[09:29:23] net oh and I have an additional mission
[09:29:27] for you
[09:29:28] three yes Father Bring Me The Traveler
[09:29:31] taragi is disappear was not a part of my
[09:29:34] plan but I can use it to make a
[09:29:36] breakthrough with this as my excuse I
[09:29:40] can ask for an official audience and
[09:29:42] continue my investigation of finina and
[09:29:45] udex net the initiative belongs to the
[09:29:48] house of the Hearth my wish to
[09:29:50] investigate the Fortress of mpede will
[09:29:52] be a front Lenny and his group will be
[09:29:55] responsible for the actual intelligence
[09:30:00] gathering damn what the [ __ ] just
[09:30:05] happened the [ __ ] just happened dude
[09:30:09] D nobody really cared what happened to
[09:30:10] child Lenny's group is quite close to
[09:30:13] you so they wouldn't have hidden
[09:30:15] anything from
[09:30:17] you you attacked the hydro the [ __ ] is
[09:30:20] she here it wouldn't mean anything even
[09:30:23] if you shouted it from the rooftops
[09:30:26] after all even finina herself is still
[09:30:28] pretending that nothing of that sort
[09:30:30] ever
[09:30:32] happened all right
[09:30:34] then poor have two chances to enjoy tea
[09:30:38] with finina
[09:30:39] I have to say the leadership of Fontaine
[09:30:41] is even more inscrutable than I had
[09:30:43] imagined I once surmised that udex new
[09:30:46] vet must be the hydro archon but now
[09:30:50] that doesn't seem right to me either the
[09:30:52] hydro archon's dead how' you come to
[09:30:54] that conclusion I am a servant of her
[09:30:56] majesty the Sarita over my years of
[09:31:00] service I've learned how a real archon
[09:31:02] conducts and Carries themselves whether
[09:31:05] udex net or finina neither it's the bill
[09:31:09] it's hard to imagine either of them as
[09:31:11] the archon of course that is all just
[09:31:15] how I feel
[09:31:16] oh it's
[09:31:18] Ki no wonder I've been saying she's the
[09:31:23] that after all my years working an
[09:31:24] intelligence gathering I've come to
[09:31:27] realize I am at a complete loss
[09:31:29] regarding the identity of the god of the
[09:31:31] land of my birth don't you think
[09:31:34] Fontaine is quite intriguing a
[09:31:37] catastrophe lose yet many Secrets have
[09:31:39] yet to rise to the
[09:31:42] surface it looks like fontans will have
[09:31:45] no choice but to save themselves
[09:31:47] ultimately though one must survive in
[09:31:51] order to do anything else should the
[09:31:54] need arise I would be happy to cooperate
[09:31:57] with you you don't need to commit to
[09:32:00] anything right now of course I have a
[09:32:02] feeling that the situation will continue
[09:32:04] to evolve and as your name is often
[09:32:07] connected with Noble Deeds I'm sure we
[09:32:10] will work together someday I'm sure to
[09:32:14] never let he certainly returned quickly
[09:32:18] you must want to catch up with each
[09:32:19] other so I'll leave you to
[09:32:26] him uh-oh I'm sorry Father that is it
[09:32:30] over for now yes but this issue will
[09:32:33] prove quite thorny in the long term I'm
[09:32:36] concerned that sooner or later the
[09:32:37] prophesies events will occur thank you
[09:32:40] for protecting finina yo we didn't do
[09:32:43] [ __ ] I'm going be honest we actually we
[09:32:45] did more harm than good I can't lie we
[09:32:47] were [ __ ] useless I used my power to
[09:32:49] force back the primordial Sea and reeal
[09:32:51] the slle gate and for
[09:32:56] us H so as expected the Nave has turned
[09:33:01] up the pressure on Farina she's trying
[09:33:04] to feel her out though I'm still unsure
[09:33:07] as to her motives
[09:33:09] okay do not use my zyo happy emote and
[09:33:11] then type n see after that is not the
[09:33:13] proper use of my emote and quite frankly
[09:33:16] it is tainting it can I ask you some
[09:33:17] questions permission
[09:33:19] granted you have enough power to force
[09:33:20] back the primordial SE does this mean
[09:33:22] you have enough power to throw it back
[09:33:25] wa it can't be that you're the real
[09:33:27] Hydro archine right but that's just a
[09:33:31] speculation on our part
[09:33:33] though you can't tell us then
[09:33:38] then that's okay we could talk about
[09:33:41] something else we won't try to force you
[09:33:44] but that's just a theory strange if by
[09:33:48] the phrase you guys you are referring to
[09:33:51] finina and I then although I'm not sure
[09:33:53] just what you are trying to imply I must
[09:33:55] clarify that I do not share her
[09:33:58] positions on a multitude of topics what
[09:34:01] did he say to the Fortress of mar did
[09:34:02] you manage to protect those that needed
[09:34:03] to be defended I believe so the Fortress
[09:34:06] has a long and complex history it has
[09:34:09] seen much grief and
[09:34:12] suffering and now another catastrophe
[09:34:15] will soon be upon us I mourn this it's
[09:34:19] about to start [ __ ] raining watch huh
[09:34:22] why is it raining all of a sudden I knew
[09:34:28] [Music]
[09:34:30] it it said that a dragon of water once
[09:34:33] resided f 10 bro are you does the
[09:34:36] [ __ ] do lumine and Pon think we're
[09:34:38] [ __ ] stupid bro frem literally said
[09:34:41] in like the first cut scene that when
[09:34:43] the dragon cries it rains and then nevet
[09:34:45] cried and it was like a clear assumption
[09:34:48] in like 4.0 and people pretended they
[09:34:50] didn't know who the [ __ ] Dragon was
[09:34:51] bro it's been like four patches you may
[09:34:54] closer to the truth than you think oh
[09:34:57] and what are you thinking he's the
[09:34:59] dragon Sovereign of
[09:35:01] water the dragon
[09:35:05] of what yeah you know how Jong is a
[09:35:07] dragon but like Gio okay but you know
[09:35:10] APAP
[09:35:12] right have you heard of
[09:35:15] dallen
[09:35:22] finina Vette are you
[09:35:26] listening my
[09:35:28] apologies we were just guessing randomly
[09:35:31] we didn't guess right did we you're not
[09:35:34] actually the dragon Sovereign of water
[09:35:36] right well you want to confirm oh no we
[09:35:39] have the jangly isn't a dragon or in my
[09:35:41] chat correctly I sincerely hope you it's
[09:35:44] actually just one of his forms it's not
[09:35:45] technically a sovereign Dragon it's just
[09:35:47] a form he and Al didn't recognize him so
[09:35:50] actually if you read there's still
[09:35:53] something P wants to ask you though
[09:35:56] please go
[09:35:57] ahead well if you are the true I don't
[09:36:01] care and you are able to he has a dragon
[09:36:04] form so that's all then prophecy is all
[09:36:08] about seawater couldn't you just use
[09:36:10] your power to solve the
[09:36:12] crisis none of the currently living
[09:36:15] dragon sovereigns in the world myself
[09:36:17] included possess our full Dragon Hood
[09:36:21] they say that when the first usurper
[09:36:23] arrived on user They seized a part of
[09:36:25] the dragon's power today that stolen
[09:36:29] power is the basis of the archon's
[09:36:32] authorities there are seven Elemental
[09:36:34] archons and seven matching Dragon
[09:36:37] sovereign
[09:36:38] the dragon Sovereign of water who lived
[09:36:40] through that era perished a long time
[09:36:42] ago as their successor I know far less
[09:36:46] sucess ancient history in any case I
[09:36:50] will not be able to do much don't I this
[09:36:52] gu AR disappears returns their Elemental
[09:36:54] Authority to me given the status quo
[09:36:58] however I would recommend finding
[09:36:59] another way to deal with the prophecy oh
[09:37:03] so even you can't solve it I still have
[09:37:06] some urgent matters to attend to at my

[09:43:14] Nave you meant father she said a few
[09:43:18] things that were bro it's 1:30 a.m. I
[09:43:19] think my dad woke up I don't know how
[09:43:21] hard to understand I actually can't go
[09:43:22] upstairs anymore to working with us in
[09:43:26] the attitude towards you is even better
[09:43:28] than what we'd imagined you should
[09:43:30] believe you were yelling she has her own
[09:43:32] way of doing things and she'll do
[09:43:33] everything in her power to help those
[09:43:35] she considers close which now might also
[09:43:37] include you mhm father is very capable
[09:43:41] and also trustworthy oh pman just
[09:43:44] remembered that she thought Lenny was a
[09:43:46] bit too proud as well she said that you
[09:43:48] should learn how to rely on others
[09:43:50] sometimes
[09:43:51] uh that does sound like something that

[09:44:19] saying no let me ask a followup question

[09:44:23] could pause and do something else like
[09:44:25] is there a point before it gets too hype
[09:44:27] where I could like or is it just the
[09:44:29] whole thing is at like is POG the whole

[09:48:58] decide if we do half of it or all of it
[09:49:00] or if we do it tomorrow or whatever I'm
[09:49:03] going to I'm going to think I don't know
[09:49:05] what the play is cuz Okay on one hand I
[09:49:08] think we can do it I do but on the other
[09:49:10] hand we could if I have to interrupt
[09:49:13] near the end I will be tilted now I've
[09:49:15] seen some people do it in 4 and 1 half
[09:49:16] hours well by seen I mean looking at the
[09:49:18] VOD but also if it's a banger I could
[09:49:21] upload the VOD of me doing on the second
[09:49:23] Channel he can't skip no I can like it's
[09:49:25] my decision I can skip it it doesn't
[09:49:27] matter but like I don't want to like I

[09:52:38] Your Grace good to see you y is there
[09:52:41] something you wish to see me about yeah
[09:52:43] what was with that earthquake just now
[09:52:45] Kur got me there was the 10
[09:52:48] gifted appreciate it ah that the Tremor
[09:52:52] didn't originate from the seaf Flor in
[09:52:54] fact it seems it came from the surface
[09:52:56] from the surface over the years of
[09:52:57] serving as the warden here I have
[09:52:58] developed a sense for distinguishing
[09:53:00] between what occurs on the surface and
[09:53:02] what occurs
[09:53:03] underwater besides the seal that m n let
[09:53:06] set in place won't fail so easy not a
[09:53:08] bad pronunciation on M also I think the
[09:53:12] dialog volume is a bit quiet I'll turn
[09:53:14] up after this cut scene also I think
[09:53:15] neet just earthquake so the Fortress is
[09:53:18] okay if you recall our last incident If
[09:53:21] there really were a problem there would
[09:53:22] be crowds of inmates in a panic right
[09:53:24] now huh you've got a point okay seems we
[09:53:29] need to get back up to the surface and
[09:53:30] ask about what happened okay uh by the
[09:53:34] way do you know what day it is today
[09:53:36] it's the day you get a job pip I believe

[09:56:54] then that's one and then you have to
[09:56:56] talk to another dude and then that's one

[09:56:58] you're literally talking for like an
[09:56:59] hour just for one hello you've come at
[09:57:02] the right time but you'll have to wait

[09:57:30] [Music]
[09:57:33] work all right that should wrap things
[09:57:35] up for now
[09:57:36] are you done with your work dude P sorry
[09:57:40] to keep you
[09:57:41] waiting today should be the day you were
[09:57:44] released from the Fortress of meped and
[09:57:46] it appears that youve managed to
[09:57:48] complete all the release paperwork
[09:57:50] that's right and we came here to see you
[09:57:52] right away
[09:57:53] nice you and Pon tell nevet everything
[09:57:56] that happened since the primordial sea
[09:57:58] incident as well as your dream regarding
[09:57:59] child whale do you have any idea what
[09:58:02] that might be that's you chat you're the
[09:58:04] massive whale from your description not
[09:58:06] me though that cannot have occurred in
[09:58:07] any ordinary Waters but rather something
[09:58:10] like the primordial sea okay I'm looking
[09:58:13] I'm going to stop yapping during the
[09:58:14] archon quest I probably won't but during
[09:58:17] important moments I won't anyways I look
[09:58:19] at my audio mixer and I my mic goes to
[09:58:22] the high yellow almost red and the game
[09:58:24] only stays in the green should I turn
[09:58:26] the game up even
[09:58:28] louder or is it fine anyways let's keep
[09:58:31] going a whale of that size and shape
[09:58:33] cannot usually be found in the waters of
[09:58:35] tat therefore we can only assume the
[09:58:38] child is presently immersed in
[09:58:40] primordial
[09:58:41] seawater immersed in primordial sea but
[09:58:45] hell he's not from font Pon most people
[09:58:47] wouldn't be capable of entering he's a
[09:58:50] I'm not completely sure how he could
[09:58:52] have gotten there myself there's
[09:58:54] something we'd like to ask you
[09:58:56] about are you free to what is it are you
[09:58:59] free all right P felt it too we asked
[09:59:02] the Duke and he said it wasn't from
[09:59:04] underwater so we figured you might know
[09:59:06] know something about it it turns out
[09:59:08] that I have just received a report about
[09:59:10] this particular matter in fact that's
[09:59:12] exactly what I was busy with a moment
[09:59:14] ago the source of the Tremor was here on
[09:59:17] the surface near Pon after the shaking
[09:59:20] stopped the water in the pon area Rose
[09:59:23] at an alarming rate Chad plon means fish
[09:59:25] and Rose is a flower yeah you might not
[09:59:27] have known that the water Rose I'm so
[09:59:30] funny what about the people there toet
[09:59:34] the water levels only Rose for a short
[09:59:36] period of time and have already returned
[09:59:38] to normal now however I still have a bad
[09:59:42] feeling about the whole phenomenon if
[09:59:44] the change in water levels is connected
[09:59:46] with the leaking primordial seawater
[09:59:48] then the situation in Pon may be much
[09:59:50] worse than it appears okay that's
[09:59:52] interesting should be right we need to
[09:59:55] go check on her oh
[09:59:58] no I would also like to go there as soon
[10:00:00] as possible but I'm afraid I can't leave
[10:00:02] just yet oh no we must immediately
[10:00:04] formulate disaster prevention plans for
[10:00:06] the surrounding coal areas to avoid
[10:00:08] potential I'll have to ask you two to go
[10:00:10] to Pon first I'll meet you there to
[10:00:12] check on the situation once I finish
[10:00:14] things here sounds like a plan of L no
[10:00:17] time to lose let's get going please be
[10:00:20] careful okay listen first of all I'm
[10:00:23] excited for this Quest I've heard only
[10:00:25] good things that I've managed to avoid
[10:00:26] spoilers however all I know we talked
[10:00:28] about this yesterday for those of you
[10:00:30] just tuning in all I know is that in the
[10:00:32] Navia Gameplay trailer should I even say
[10:00:35] this I don't want to spoil people that
[10:00:36] aren't but like I want you guys to know
[10:00:38] what I saw cuz I can't be like

[10:00:43] can't like okay I mean if you didn't see
[10:00:45] it I'll just say it later whatever what
[10:00:47] like I mean for YouTube frogs I don't
[10:00:48] want to spoil it so I'll just shut up

[10:03:28] moment no I'm in
[10:03:31] the oh it's Navia yo oh
[10:03:36] that was midair hey Navia are you
[10:03:39] okay oh hi
[10:03:42] Navia honestly all of the casualties
[10:03:45] were were worth it if it meant seeing
[10:03:46] you again hey
[10:03:49] I'm we heard there was a situation in so
[10:03:52] we came as quickly as we could question
[10:03:54] mark okay I didn't mean that sorry as
[10:03:56] you can see the water level suddenly
[10:03:59] Rose it caused quite the disturbance in
[10:04:04] fact
[10:04:10] deisel there was a wounded resident next
[10:04:12] to a building gold like outfit we've
[10:04:14] already transported him to safety but
[10:04:16] we've run out of medical
[10:04:20] supplies he's
[10:04:21] wounded how badly he fell so it's
[10:04:25] probably a broken leg he's pretty shaken
[10:04:27] up when the water level Rose he
[10:04:29] desperately climbed up to the roof once
[10:04:31] the water receded and he saw the ground
[10:04:33] he became terrified and eventually
[10:04:37] he jumped down then find the leader of
[10:04:40] squad one and tell him to take the
[10:04:42] wounded resident to see a doctor he
[10:04:44] should know where to
[10:04:45] go understood I'll take over his search
[10:04:48] and rescue mission in the meantime all
[10:04:50] right you'll be in
[10:04:54] charge I'm sorry where were we uh this
[10:04:59] situation imp H right allow me to
[10:05:04] explain I'm listening earlier
[10:05:06] we suddenly heard a loud wait why is it
[10:05:07] so quiet hello at first everyone thought
[10:05:10] that something might have exploded in
[10:05:11] the waterways but before we knew it
[10:05:15] Water started pouring out from
[10:05:18] everywhere it's a bug I mean okay well I
[10:05:21] barely a little earlier we suddenly
[10:05:23] heard a loud noise at first everyone
[10:05:25] thought that something might have
[10:05:26] exploded in the waterways but before we
[10:05:27] knew it Water started pouring out from
[10:05:29] everywhere Rushing Water seemed a little
[10:05:32] odd almost like the unique color of
[10:05:34] primordial sea
[10:05:36] water some people didn't realize the
[10:05:38] danger and thought it was just ordinary
[10:05:40] water leaking from somewhere okay
[10:05:43] everyone on the street who happened to
[10:05:45] be close to the water didn't have a
[10:05:47] chance to
[10:05:49] escape as the water levels Rose they
[10:05:53] suddenly
[10:05:56] disappeared they were all dissolved
[10:05:59] those who realized what was happening
[10:06:01] started to flee in a panic desperately
[10:06:04] trying to get to Higher Ground round
[10:06:06] many were injured in the Stampede and
[10:06:08] some some people fell from significant
[10:06:15] Heights the spad rosula initiated rescue
[10:06:18] operations as quickly as possible but
[10:06:20] there have been a lot of
[10:06:24] casualties fortunately the water began
[10:06:27] to recede after some time and the chaos
[10:06:30] came to an end the water that flooded
[10:06:32] the area contained primordial seawater
[10:06:35] so the lower levels of Pon are still
[10:06:38] hazardous to ensure everyone's safety
[10:06:40] I've asked the people there to leave as
[10:06:42] soon as possible no one knows if this
[10:06:45] could happen
[10:06:47] again all we can do for now is try our
[10:06:50] best to help Evacuate the residents okay
[10:06:53] we still haven't completed the headcount
[10:06:55] but we'll have some numbers soon how
[10:06:58] awful and all of this just came out of
[10:07:01] nowhere it was quite frightening
[10:07:04] indeed
[10:07:07] I only wish that everything that just
[10:07:09] happened was a bad dream is there any
[10:07:13] way we can help Navia yeah we're here to
[10:07:15] help thank you for being so willing to
[10:07:18] help in a moment of Crisis like this you
[10:07:21] don't know how much it means to me I
[10:07:25] really can't express how grateful I
[10:07:29] am we're missing some people aren't we
[10:07:32] uh-oh uh-oh oh no
[10:07:36] oh no silver no
[10:07:38] [Music]
[10:07:40] no wait they're wait but they're not on
[10:07:43] wait if we listen listen okay listen
[10:07:46] Now's the Time I can say it the only
[10:07:47] thing I saw in the Navia trailer was
[10:07:49] that silver and M weren't there but if
[10:07:52] we don't see them in the quest they
[10:07:54] could be somewhere else dude it they
[10:07:56] weren't necessarily here let's
[10:07:58] ask oh no I'm sorry for asking Navia
[10:08:02] demoiselle we've got a situation here
[10:08:07] I'll be right there yo yo what is this
[10:08:10] I'll shut
[10:08:12] up sorry I need to go for now no they're
[10:08:16] actually dude they could be fine and now
[10:08:19] she goes seems it might be a while
[10:08:21] before she can take a
[10:08:25] break NAIA walks around talking with as
[10:08:27] many people as can for or matters her
[10:08:29] decisions are clear and reasonable the
[10:08:31] wounded are being tended to and we
[10:08:33] finished the preliminary headcount more
[10:08:35] support has just arrived so I suppose I
[10:08:39] finally have a moment to focus on my own
[10:08:41] matters of course we should remain ready
[10:08:44] for anything and continue doing our best
[10:08:47] to rescue others I'll be sure to have
[10:08:49] everyone at the Spina D rosula ready to
[10:08:51] render assistance traveler
[10:08:54] Pimon would you two accompany me to my
[10:08:57] father's grave for a moment yeah sure
[10:09:00] Navia right now thank you like the wait
[10:09:03] your father like the guy Claren killed
[10:09:05] or the what oh achievement what the [ __ ]
[10:09:08] is the Phantom thieves
[10:09:11] re in any
[10:09:16] case please please please please oh but
[10:09:20] the very next day you gave it
[10:09:26] away
[10:09:28] wait wait is this a lot of people here
[10:09:31] huh wait what quest is this wait is this
[10:09:33] wait wait wait is this the ARA
[10:09:39] huh okay this is Aron Quest okay we're
[10:09:42] back we're back we're back well given
[10:09:45] the time of day and the whole situation
[10:09:46] in pon pon doesn't think there'd be a
[10:09:49] ton of people here visiting graves right
[10:09:53] that's how things are now she sounds so
[10:09:57] sad are so exhausted that they've no
[10:09:59] strength to spare any words for the dead
[10:10:03] um Navia
[10:10:05] there's no need to push yourself okay
[10:10:07] that's kind of a bad line given that a
[10:10:09] bunch of her friends died and people and
[10:10:11] like people that lived that probably not
[10:10:13] the best time to say don't push there's
[10:10:15] no need to push yourself so
[10:10:18] hard uhoh yo
[10:10:21] yo no NAIA what's wrong y Huger sorry I
[10:10:28] I
[10:10:31] just Malo and
[10:10:33] silver they won't ever come back here
[10:10:37] again what should I do
[10:10:43] Papa oh
[10:10:45] huh what happened to them
[10:10:49] Navia everyone agreed on the rescue plan
[10:10:52] but
[10:10:54] still I was the one who initiated it
[10:10:58] they were helping Evacuate the residents
[10:11:00] but they couldn't leave in time
[10:11:03] and
[10:11:05] and they were caught in the
[10:11:08] seawater what what should we do I've
[10:11:13] known them for so
[10:11:16] long and I know they weren't
[10:11:19] afraid
[10:11:20] but but I could at least hold a funeral
[10:11:24] for my father and I know where he
[10:11:28] rests but as from malose and silver
[10:11:31] they're just
[10:11:33] gone I just can't D My
[10:11:38] Goats Oh I thought everything looks so
[10:11:42] clean after it rains even the
[10:11:46] gravestones I didn't expect that you'd
[10:11:48] enjoy a glass of red wine in front of
[10:11:50] Master Call's grave I can understand
[10:11:54] besides the scenery here isn't half bad
[10:11:57] see it's not just me I always want to
[10:12:01] bring something when I visit Papa
[10:12:04] perhaps we might even have a picnic
[10:12:06] that's [ __ ] he wouldn't be angry would
[10:12:08] he how could Master ever be upset with
[10:12:11] you demoiselle yet the cemetery is the
[10:12:14] home of those who have passed is it not
[10:12:18] everyone ends up here sooner or later no
[10:12:21] matter who you are buying yourself a
[10:12:23] plot in advance are you no need
[10:12:27] yet but when I do I hope you'll let me
[10:12:30] be buried beside Master callus
[10:12:33] demoiselle hey hey stop wait maybe he's
[10:12:36] not dead Okay hear me out he wants to be
[10:12:38] buried next to the master so what if in
[10:12:41] order to fulfill his wish he can't die
[10:12:44] without his body being found so he's te
[10:12:46] he's on vacation the riters didn't
[10:12:48] actually kill him true he's still alive
[10:12:50] maybe no he's not I'm quite serious that
[10:12:53] way it will save us both the trip to see
[10:12:56] each other whenever you visit your
[10:12:57] father's
[10:13:01] grave that makes sense in that case
[10:13:04] could I be buried on his other side
[10:13:07] after all besides you yeah man we got it
[10:13:10] the two of us could certainly be
[10:13:12] considered Master's closest companions
[10:13:14] no yeah man personally I believe we fill
[10:13:17] those shoes just
[10:13:19] fine why are you bringing this up all of
[10:13:22] a sudden
[10:13:25] seriously all right all right I'll
[10:13:28] forhad it but I'd really prefer not to
[10:13:31] talk about this stuff and what do you
[10:13:34] mean by saving me a trip I'd make the
[10:13:37] journey even if I had to visit you two
[10:13:39] somewhere
[10:13:40] else i' promised to let them rest in
[10:13:43] peace here but here I am breaking that
[10:13:50] promise I'm sorry for letting you see me
[10:13:52] in a mess like this I don't usually cry
[10:13:56] really Pon doesn't know how to help you
[10:13:59] feel better but I had always thought I
[10:14:03] could make my wishes come
[10:14:05] true but now that I think about it that
[10:14:09] never solely relied on
[10:14:11] me many things can only be accomplished
[10:14:14] with someone else's help Mose and silver
[10:14:17] have helped me so much but by
[10:14:22] contrast I could do nothing for them I'm
[10:14:26] so sorry that you can spend as much time
[10:14:30] as you need here Navia we'll stay with
[10:14:32] you yeah we're here for you thank thank
[10:14:34] you right now you don't know how much
[10:14:37] that
[10:14:38] means by the way you can have a look at
[10:14:41] this it's a list of victims from the
[10:14:44] incident that took place here
[10:14:47] OA
[10:14:48] Khan Bernett Des
[10:14:52] s
[10:14:54] Francine
[10:14:56] Karina Daisy
[10:14:59] Ray okay I'm skiing this I'm sorry but
[10:15:01] Meo and silver were there it's okay I
[10:15:04] just can't list for too
[10:15:05] long and you're
[10:15:08] right we lost Malo and
[10:15:12] silver but we were able to save more
[10:15:15] than we
[10:15:16] anticipated the overall outcome
[10:15:19] indicates that the
[10:15:21] cost was worth
[10:15:23] it wait but what if Meo and silver open
[10:15:26] the map and teleported to a waypoint
[10:15:28] right before the primordial seawater
[10:15:30] over like what no one's sacrifice is
[10:15:32] truly necessary don't think that way
[10:15:36] Navia one person might be saved at the
[10:15:39] expense of another Shore but that isn't
[10:15:41] something we should ever consider a
[10:15:44] trade Malo and silver were not the price
[10:15:47] for saving anyone they're Heroes um good
[10:15:51] Pon take for
[10:15:52] once thank you Pon what you said just
[10:15:55] now was pretty amazing
[10:15:58] actually I'll remember your words oh uh
[10:16:03] seems you've been become more eloquent
[10:16:05] in the time since
[10:16:08] Rel wait a second okay arino I always
[10:16:12] love to see I always love to see you
[10:16:16] however why are you here at the funeral
[10:16:17] were you involved in this if you killed
[10:16:20] milose or silver we I will have to
[10:16:22] choose a side and I don't know which
[10:16:24] side I will choose however I'm
[10:16:26] always I can't speak I get nervous
[10:16:29] around what are you doing here hello is
[10:16:33] everything going well on your
[10:16:35] yes my people are carrying out the
[10:16:37] mission according to your request oh
[10:16:38] wait never mind all the residents of Pon
[10:16:40] have been evacuated and we are preparing
[10:16:42] to relocate them to Higher Ground thanks
[10:16:45] father as for these supplies we have
[10:16:47] everything taken care of there is no
[10:16:49] need to worry thank you very
[10:16:53] much wait do you two know each other
[10:16:58] yo dude her design is so sick I'm sorry
[10:17:01] we just met recently right Miss Navia
[10:17:05] H usually I would call this a
[10:17:08] coincidental encounter but that doesn't
[10:17:10] quite fit this time besides my mind that
[10:17:14] a fouille Harbinger would come looking
[10:17:16] for me a little suspicious nav you we
[10:17:19] let that slide spad rosula received
[10:17:21] generous support from the foule which
[10:17:23] allowed us to complete the rescue and
[10:17:25] evacuation work so quickly Mutual Aid is
[10:17:29] essential to fostering positive
[10:17:31] developments we were already in the area
[10:17:33] in any case so it was nothing that said
[10:17:36] I must say that you're a lot sharper
[10:17:38] than you let on I'm sure you understand
[10:17:41] what I mean I apologize for all the ways
[10:17:44] in which I tested you previously we've
[10:17:47] never worked with a fouille before and
[10:17:49] it's extremely important for us to know
[10:17:51] who we're working with my subordinates
[10:17:54] have reported that fouille soldiers have
[10:17:55] been observing water levels and taking
[10:17:57] head counts in various locations I hear
[10:18:00] that they've also prepared a large
[10:18:01] amount of emergency supplies I'm quite
[10:18:05] surprised this is nothing to brag about
[10:18:07] nor do I intend to it is simply the way
[10:18:10] of powerful organizations to act
[10:18:13] forcefully whether they are doing good
[10:18:15] or ill you've witnessed that firsthand
[10:18:18] in any case whatever you say as I've
[10:18:19] told this traveler before I know of the
[10:18:22] prophecy and I intend to prevent the
[10:18:24] impending disaster lending your
[10:18:27] organization a hand was a natural first
[10:18:29] step in accomplishing that as such do
[10:18:32] not be troubled by this token of our
[10:18:35] sincerity perhaps one day you'll also be
[10:18:38] able to help me in the same way without
[10:18:41] your help there would have been many
[10:18:43] more
[10:18:44] casualties I won't forget your kindness
[10:18:48] Chad imagine if arino they make her fire
[10:18:50] that either the red like a different
[10:18:52] color it could be the red on her back
[10:18:53] like it be like a like a black and red
[10:18:55] fire imagine kind of like the Luke skin
[10:18:57] but cooler or blue give her blue fire
[10:19:00] furthermore I sincerely regret what
[10:19:03] happened to Malo and silver I only wish
[10:19:06] that my people could have arrived a
[10:19:07] little earlier to prevent this from
[10:19:10] happening don't say that you and your
[10:19:13] subordinates did everything you
[10:19:17] could as Pimon said Maloo and silver
[10:19:20] didn't choose to sacrifice themselves
[10:19:22] for any specific person and they weren't
[10:19:25] the price paid for other salvation they
[10:19:28] chose to become Heroes themselves I've
[10:19:32] never liked hearing people put it that
[10:19:33] way it's like trying to relieve pain by
[10:19:36] saying some Noble sounding words but
[10:19:40] right now there's nothing more
[10:19:43] suitable they really did become Heroes
[10:19:46] you're right I'm sorry for your loss
[10:19:49] Miss
[10:19:51] Navia water is life to fontaine's people
[10:19:55] and it also spells disaster it's no
[10:19:58] wonder that people always say that
[10:20:00] prophecies represent fate fortunately
[10:20:03] I've never never been one for such
[10:20:05] opinions okay so you're one who will try
[10:20:08] to change fate then of course that is
[10:20:11] why am going to Hotel B I still have
[10:20:14] some things to take care of and the
[10:20:16] children need my attention I mean it's
[10:20:20] hotel but nice try not bad it's okay I I
[10:20:23] forgive you I could actually teach you
[10:20:24] arino if ever like you're like way
[10:20:26] traveler Pon one more thing
[10:20:30] yeah all right then we'll
[10:20:32] just uh uh huh this isn't right P
[10:20:38] thought you would ask us to walk with
[10:20:40] you for a moment so you could tell us
[10:20:41] something in private that is a clever
[10:20:44] and useful conversation technique which
[10:20:46] I do like to use when necessary but
[10:20:49] there's no need today she likes Hur to
[10:20:51] have Miss Navia listening in traveler
[10:20:54] I'm sure you remember that I said we
[10:20:56] could work together when we had the
[10:20:58] chance you and I both know that there
[10:21:00] may be issues with the primordial C
[10:21:03] previous iously it was the Fortress of
[10:21:05] meped slle gate and this time it was the
[10:21:08] water levels in Pon these are both
[10:21:11] signals so the time for Jolly
[10:21:13] Corporation has come indeed allow me to
[10:21:16] share the latest Intel I've received
[10:21:18] from the house of the hearths
[10:21:19] intelligence network with you during
[10:21:21] some recent investigations a child
[10:21:24] claimed to have discovered some ruins
[10:21:26] near Pon the ruins date back to ancient
[10:21:29] times and seem to be worth investigating
[10:21:32] in many ways okay cool
[10:21:34] the dating of the ruins they may be
[10:21:36] related to the prophecy and the coming
[10:21:38] crisis the situation is becoming more
[10:21:41] urgent so any pertinent information will
[10:21:44] prove extremely precious okay I'll I'll
[10:21:46] text give me your phone number initially
[10:21:48] came to prepare for ruin exploration
[10:21:51] unexpectedly this disaster struck and at
[10:21:54] present we're all busy prioritizing the
[10:21:57] rescue effort so that's why the foui
[10:22:00] were already in Pon I wanted to take the
[10:22:03] children along but unfortunately Linny
[10:22:06] Lynette and F have all been dispatched
[10:22:08] to Higher Grounds to assist affected
[10:22:10] residents bro fem is going to go drown
[10:22:13] again trying that was too soon I'm sorry

[10:25:11] back okay uh there I feel like there's
[10:25:13] going to be a hidden chest here but
[10:25:15] we're just going to useless yeah it's
[10:25:18] fine hey can we okay look I know hilly
[10:25:20] trolls enemies right but we just did the
[10:25:22] carry Bear Quest we know that hilly
[10:25:24] trolls are real people and we are
[10:25:25] currently mourning people that got
[10:25:27] disintegrated by water which which
[10:25:29] basically is pretty similar to you know
[10:25:31] these humans that got cursed so can we
[10:25:33] not have to kill them okay we have to
[10:25:35] kill
[10:25:36] them minus four hilly
[10:25:41] TRS and they're suffering dude I mean
[10:25:44] okay if it's like a if some of the hilly
[10:25:46] trolls I get it but dude if you're the
[10:25:47] hilly troll with a scythe are you really
[10:25:48] suffering that guy looks like he's
[10:25:50] [ __ ] bro he looks kind of he looks
[10:25:51] like he's living the life well maybe not
[10:25:53] okay I guess it would suck to be but he
[10:25:55] at least has a scythe he's
[10:25:58] cool this place has also been
[10:26:01] contaminated by primordial seawat
[10:26:05] yeah and a lot of it too stop a Fontan
[10:26:10] would most likely dissolve the moment
[10:26:12] they fell in first of all stop typing
[10:26:14] minus one chest we didn't miss one
[10:26:15] second of all Navia please I don't want
[10:26:18] to risk you
[10:26:19] dissolving you should go back for safety
[10:26:21] right you can't go down if there's
[10:26:23] primordial seawater it's too dangerous
[10:26:26] and it won't be any help for you to just
[10:26:28] stay here you
[10:26:31] did don't get by my we're not saying
[10:26:34] you're useless it's just that no you're
[10:26:38] right I can't do anything in this
[10:26:41] situation I'll leave this to you from
[10:26:43] the looks of things maybe there's no way
[10:26:46] uhoh wait a second yeah we just fell
[10:26:49] from like oh
[10:26:51] no wait she's Geo just oh just crystall
[10:26:55] you can just build a rock and climb it
[10:26:57] yep maybe the only way left is forward
[10:27:01] in that case do you want to wait for us
[10:27:03] here
[10:27:04] the water levels here are unstable and
[10:27:07] there's a chance the water will rise so
[10:27:10] staying here wouldn't be safe either
[10:27:12] I'll go together with you perhaps we'll
[10:27:15] find the exit just up ahead seems like
[10:27:17] there isn't any other option all right
[10:27:19] come with us for now
[10:27:23] uhoh uh-oh wait how is Navia going to
[10:27:26] make this jump I mean no she can make
[10:27:28] the jump wait what happens if we jump in
[10:27:30] as a font 10 character do we dissolve
[10:27:31] wait let me try I can't configure the
[10:27:33] party Terina count I mean she
[10:27:37] is wait what if I go as

[10:27:45] hydro and not from font oh wait FR skill
[10:27:49] wait a second what the [ __ ] is there yo
[10:27:52] yo wait that's kind of sick imagine
[10:27:54] there's a hidden chest here you need
[10:27:56] finina or kakomi you ever Tred to go on
[10:27:57] like the Sid trck like there's like two
[10:27:59] options right there's like one road that
[10:28:00] looks po like busting and there's
[10:28:02] another road road that looks like no
[10:28:04] one's going there and then you try to go
[10:28:05] to the road that's like less popular but
[10:28:07] it ends up being the popular like it
[10:28:09] okay I explained this terribly it's like
[10:28:11] there's two roads and then one of them
[10:28:12] you think is just a Sidetrack right so
[10:28:14] you just go to see if there's a chest
[10:28:15] but it ends up being the main road and
[10:28:17] then you keep going and it's too far
[10:28:18] gone to go back and then you wonder if
[10:28:19] the other Road had like a chest or
[10:28:21] something that you missed and then you
[10:28:22] can never go back no just me okay sorry
[10:28:24] I'm actually sorry for speaking I'm

[10:30:42] debt dispute with him and we'd resolved
[10:30:45] the matter not long
[10:30:47] ago we were headed to see how things

[10:31:14] knocking at my door day and night even
[10:31:16] my neighbor Oba was getting fed up with
[10:31:18] them sometimes force is required to calm
[10:31:22] someone down and get them to listen to
[10:31:24] what you have to
[10:31:26] say that's right oh by the way brunette
[10:31:30] what was it that you wanted to give to

[10:35:07] you not yet realized what you've done in
[10:35:11] that case allow me to
[10:35:12] explain as all here know you are Master
[10:35:16] Call's successor the head of the spad
[10:35:20] rasula someone held in high regard by
[10:35:23] every soul in puon after you took over
[10:35:27] the spena you treated all of us just
[10:35:29] like the late Master callus had if
[10:35:32] anyone in need reached out to you for
[10:35:34] help you responded not only you but your
[10:35:37] butler your subordinates nearly everyone
[10:35:40] in the Spina D rasula fought for the
[10:35:43] well-being of those in
[10:35:46] Pon wait a moment aren't you just
[10:35:50] proving that I'm a good person yes
[10:35:53] correct absolutely right and that is why
[10:35:58] You Stand Accused you have helped so
[10:36:01] many people get through so many
[10:36:04] difficulties you are one with us we are
[10:36:09] inseparable okay we are one big family
[10:36:12] all of us who are from Pon inextricably
[10:36:15] linked and with you being so
[10:36:18] important we couldn't possibly do
[10:36:20] without you therefore this fair and
[10:36:23] honorable Court shall declare you guilty
[10:36:26] and you shall stay here you will be
[10:36:28] together with us forever I'm good
[10:36:33] H what are you saying I'll pass on that
[10:36:37] everything you have said is correct I
[10:36:40] have indeed done a lot for my hometown
[10:36:42] and I would be willing to be with you
[10:36:44] all but what is the purpose of having me
[10:36:47] stand here like this what is there to
[10:36:50] discuss oh well if that's what you think
[10:36:54] then I have no further
[10:36:57] comments how wonderful Miss
[10:37:01] Navia
[10:37:05] I know all these
[10:37:07] people why are they
[10:37:10] laughing me too silver I seem to
[10:37:13] remember now yes I get it this trial
[10:37:19] is wait just a moment th this isn't
[10:37:23] right yo
[10:37:26] Mose what was that Mr Malo our
[10:37:30] conclusion is very clear and un ious let
[10:37:33] the court judge her now she's guilty
[10:37:37] stay here Navia you're one of
[10:37:41] us timel don't admit guilt this trial
[10:37:44] means to keep you here
[10:37:46] forever I wish to exercise my right to
[10:37:49] defend our lady Mr swanfield you only
[10:37:52] know of n's goodness but nothing of her
[10:37:54] utterly independent mind she was born a
[10:37:57] free and independent Spirit she has
[10:38:00] never been tied down by anything indeed
[10:38:02] even the death of Master callus couldn't
[10:38:04] stop her her actions cannot serve as
[10:38:07] proof that she identifies herself as
[10:38:09] part of any group she merely acted as an
[10:38:12] individual extending her hand to help
[10:38:15] others please do not mistake her actions
[10:38:18] as being otherwise true really as an
[10:38:21] individual you say don't forget we are
[10:38:25] all fontans here this is the nation of
[10:38:29] Justice the nation of hydro even even if
[10:38:32] Miss Navia only voluntarily rendered her
[10:38:35] assistance that doesn't change the fact
[10:38:37] that her beautiful soul must return to
[10:38:40] everyone water accepts all blends with
[10:38:45] all it will surely accept her kind
[10:38:48] actually uh sorry defendant but uh my
[10:38:51] client here actually was not trying to
[10:38:52] be nice she just thought you were ugly
[10:38:54] as [ __ ] and dumb and couldn't do
[10:38:55] anything on your own so she acted
[10:38:57] because she thought that you needed help
[10:38:59] because you're stupid and purely
[10:39:01] dependent incomp
[10:39:04] incomprehensible buffoon which is why
[10:39:06] she tried to help you guys out a bunch
[10:39:08] of [ __ ] idiots you are she actually
[10:39:10] doesn't deserve to be here or to be
[10:39:11] blended with the likes of you so I rest
[10:39:14] my case everything is measured here in
[10:39:16] the nation of hydro and in the end
[10:39:19] everyone shall meld together thus when a
[10:39:22] unanimous opinion emerges that opinion
[10:39:26] represents Justice now I speak for
[10:39:29] everyone our opinion is consistent
[10:39:33] Navia should stay we and Navia are one
[10:39:38] okay and you would call this Justice
[10:39:41] Preposterous Preposterous you I'm going
[10:39:44] to jail that theel still has a chance to
[10:39:47] exist as an individual have you
[10:39:49] forgotten how much you all once longed
[10:39:52] to become individuals to become
[10:39:55] independent do you mean to
[10:39:58] Def yo what the [ __ ] your Justice is
[10:40:01] flawed than why should we acknowledge it
[10:40:04] as you said we can also have our own
[10:40:07] Justice silver and I shall defend
[10:40:11] demoiselle and that is how we will
[10:40:14] enforce
[10:40:16] Justice my head um it hurts yo what up
[10:40:20] dude
[10:40:22] deis they're actually carrying us it
[10:40:25] hurts my head is spinning all I can see
[10:40:29] is Stars swirling in front of me I
[10:40:32] remember remember now everything that

[10:43:24] characters no wait just a
[10:43:28] second
[10:43:30] Navia you're awake
[10:43:33] good wow n that actually saved her what
[10:43:35] a [ __ ]
[10:43:37] Chad has been so far it's just him
[10:43:39] carrying the even act four him
[10:43:42] carrying they were defending me at some
[10:43:45] insane trial it looks like you're all
[10:43:48] right did all the sad feelings cause you
[10:43:51] to have a
[10:43:52] nightmare bman could give you a
[10:43:57] hug the ruins you were exploring
[10:43:59] suffered a cave in when I arrived I
[10:44:01] found you falling toward the water this
[10:44:03] guy's literally the main character he's
[10:44:04] kind of like me actually about to be
[10:44:06] dissolved within but
[10:44:09] i d
[10:44:11] h what is it he water bended I think I
[10:44:14] saw two oids protecting you never mind
[10:44:17] oh my God it's for a moment perhaps even
[10:44:19] a fraction of a second why do they make
[10:44:21] them the chance to retrieve you why did
[10:44:24] they make them the coolest characters
[10:44:26] and they kill
[10:44:27] them were it not for their intervention
[10:44:30] I would not have been able to Res you
[10:44:32] before your Consciousness
[10:44:34] dissipated wait did you say oenid you
[10:44:37] mean like what happened with
[10:44:39] v so people that are dissolved become
[10:44:42] oceanids perhaps those two oceanids were
[10:44:44] the people you saw in your dream
[10:44:48] well okay well I guess I can't cope
[10:44:50] anymore they didn't have to protect
[10:44:54] me to think that they'd keep doing so
[10:44:57] even after
[10:45:00] death please come with
[10:45:05] me
[10:45:08] oh net are you
[10:45:11] okay oh I am quite all right perhaps
[10:45:15] there's something we could chat about
[10:45:18] why do you look so stiff all of a sudden
[10:45:20] oh Pon knows here that Ty poo feels
[10:45:23] awkward when there's nothing to talk
[10:45:24] about I merely thought that we should
[10:45:26] give Navia some time to
[10:45:27] herself huh why didn't you just say so
[10:45:31] then don't you think it's even more
[10:45:34] H I suppose so by the way Siege ween
[10:45:37] sensor regards ah Siege ween I hope all
[10:45:41] is well with her these days her work in
[10:45:43] the Fortress of meped has not been too
[10:45:45] much for her has it no way don't worry
[10:45:48] she's doing fine now I see well that is
[10:45:51] good I have always worried that seen
[10:45:54] would need a lot of time to understand
[10:45:56] the world of humanity just as I have oh
[10:46:00] and the Duke also hi even though C made
[10:46:03] him do that he hopes that you haven't
[10:46:06] been overwhelmed by all that's happened
[10:46:09] lately thank you I have indeed been busy
[10:46:12] lately and I also hope that everything
[10:46:14] is going well in the Fortress of meped
[10:46:17] okay he still doesn't know what to talk
[10:46:20] about uh let's chat about something else

[10:46:44] tell you yes in fact I had arranged to
[10:46:48] meet you in Pon but when I arrived I
[10:46:50] discovered that the foui were helping
[10:46:52] the residents evacuate they had even
[10:46:54] transported a large quantity of supplies
[10:46:56] to the area amid my astonishment I ran
[10:47:00] into the Nave and we had a chat she
[10:47:02] informed me that she had asked you to
[10:47:04] investigate the ancient ruins here yeah
[10:47:07] we originally planned to meet up with
[10:47:09] you but we thought you might ouro kind
[10:47:11] of carried but also I don't know why
[10:47:12] Navia even came with us like I guess she
[10:47:15] wanted to distract herself but like bro
[10:47:16] thought you'd wrap things up so quickly
[10:47:18] surely we knew about the primordial sea
[10:47:21] I hope Navia can get back on her
[10:47:24] feet love is destructive why was that

[10:50:26] wait was there something in the door
[10:50:29] yeah it doesn't matter whatever it's
[10:50:30] fine we speed running or speed
[10:50:36] running whatever it's fine can we go
[10:50:39] back uh it's
[10:50:52] fine looks like we've reached the
[10:50:54] end this is the place there should not
[10:50:57] be any other hidden spaces in the
[10:50:59] vicinity the path sure had some twists
[10:51:02] and turns but it turns out that this
[10:51:04] place isn't actually that
[10:51:06] big there seems to be something on the
[10:51:14] wall
[10:51:17] Stone it seems like they were put here
[10:51:19] as an
[10:51:20] offering uh looks like [ __ ] is that down
[10:51:23] and have a
[10:51:25] look okay perhaps we should just leave
[10:51:28] them be for now hm
[10:51:32] there are four locations in total but
[10:51:33] only three I've heard we got a lot of
[10:51:35] fin L this Quest cuz so far it's been
[10:51:37] finina being like kind of cute but a
[10:51:39] failure and then neveress just been
[10:51:41] carrying so I assume we're going to get
[10:51:43] that low the surrounding walls also show
[10:51:46] signs of damage there's something
[10:51:49] written below let pman see uh Reon
[10:51:53] dictates that this nation be destroyed
[10:51:56] hey we love record the history of its
[10:51:59] future it past the reason dictates that
[10:52:02] this nation should be
[10:52:03] destroyed okay it feels like someone
[10:52:06] left these slates and these words here
[10:52:07] for a
[10:52:08] purpose but does he mean that Fontaine
[10:52:11] should be
[10:52:12] destroyed that would fit the
[10:52:14] circumstances dictated by the prophecy
[10:52:16] yes indeed the Slate's contents
[10:52:19] correspond to it take the second slate
[10:52:21] for
[10:52:24] example there's a person kneeling here
[10:52:27] she seems so dedicated and there there's
[10:52:31] a whole bunch of other people behind her
[10:52:33] doing the same she's facing this uh
[10:52:38] Celestia aware some kind of island in
[10:52:41] the sky and is that lady finina in the
[10:52:46] third image did the hydro archon fall
[10:52:49] into the water and is that a ring of
[10:52:52] people around her BL I doesn't quite get
[10:52:55] it are they all in the water the fourth
[10:52:58] image I know this one this exactly
[10:53:02] matches the content of the
[10:53:05] prophecy the people will all be
[10:53:07] dissolved into the waters and only the
[10:53:10] hydro archon will remain weeping on her
[10:53:13] throne wait what if the font people just
[10:53:15] move to like sumu like what if you just
[10:53:17] immigrate like what if you what if all
[10:53:19] the font just goes to like monat and
[10:53:21] then it's a March in
[10:53:24] monat hey a summer in sumaru hey [ __ ]
[10:53:30] the prophecy
[10:53:31] yes they do seem to
[10:53:33] match I'd rather have sumaru food I'm
[10:53:35] going be
[10:53:37] honest no disrespect to Fontan but I'm
[10:53:39] just saying I'll go to
[10:53:46] sumaru celesa would attract them okay
[10:53:48] fight us we have [ __ ] we have [ __ ]
[10:53:51] we have PL armor but I fear I cannot
[10:53:54] easily uncover it most likely due to us
[10:53:57] missing the first slate I am very sorry
[10:54:01] don't blame yourself Mr nalet
[10:54:03] deciphering ancient stone slates isn't
[10:54:06] one of your
[10:54:07] duties the timeline's getting the chills
[10:54:09] just looking at these slates this says
[10:54:12] that it's the history of the future
[10:54:14] right that means the prophecy should
[10:54:17] have come
[10:54:19] true the history of the future I really
[10:54:22] hope it doesn't mean
[10:54:24] that still pom feels like these images
[10:54:28] are kind of weird when you look at them
[10:54:30] together
[10:54:33] huh
[10:54:35] uh-oh
[10:54:37] uh-oh I get what you mean Pon the issue
[10:54:40] is the order of the third and fourth
[10:54:41] images right that's right yeah I knew
[10:54:44] that if the images are in chronological
[10:54:45] order shown of the fourth the waters
[10:54:48] drowning Fontaine come before the third
[10:54:50] where the hydro archon herself falls
[10:54:52] into the water and yet the order is
[10:54:55] reversed
[10:55:00] here the second is also Qui asserting
[10:55:02] what sin are the people in the images
[10:55:04] confessing to if we go by timing lady
[10:55:07] finina only emerges in the third image
[10:55:10] that means that the person in the second
[10:55:12] image we learned about that be the wait
[10:55:14] what was the name I forgot the name
[10:55:15] whatever I remember they said it last
[10:55:17] chat last stream [ __ ] Last Quest aeria
[10:55:21] then aeria that's the name I had never
[10:55:23] met her but her appearance joh the
[10:55:25] records mind it's her the previous
[10:55:27] archon kneeling before the floating
[10:55:29] island in the skies as if confessing a
[10:55:32] sin did she herself commit that
[10:55:36] sin and if not why would she be in such
[10:55:40] a posture also I'm still wondering why
[10:55:43] these ancient stone slates are here at
[10:55:45] all judging from their
[10:55:47] contents could this place be the origin
[10:55:50] of the
[10:55:53] prophecy does that mean that someone or
[10:55:55] some people once saw these slates but
[10:56:00] who would have created these slates and
[10:56:02] left these words
[10:56:05] here what if Hut did it just to [ __ ]
[10:56:07] with you I'm sorry I'll be seem that any
[10:56:09] further Clues will have to come from
[10:56:11] finina in that case there's no time to
[10:56:14] lose there's nothing else to be gained
[10:56:16] here so wait let me look at the slates a
[10:56:17] little longer let me cook a
[10:56:20] little yeah we better get somewhere safe
[10:56:23] for
[10:56:26] now honestly who created the sl's matter
[10:56:28] the real question is whether the things
[10:56:29] will truly play out as the prophecy for
[10:56:32] TS or not challenge completed wait wait
[10:56:35] let me cook for a
[10:56:38] second okay okay
[10:56:44] kneeling a new one is born they summon
[10:56:46] they [ __ ] she was like oh my God I
[10:56:48] sinned kill me she died then a new one
[10:56:51] was born they [ __ ] CH they ritual
[10:56:53] boom finina summon then everyone's dead
[10:56:56] she's weeping I don't
[10:56:58] know maybe it was like the new you know
[10:57:01] how like how like Ruka Dada was
[10:57:05] like okay never scar told me to shut up
[10:57:07] I'm sorry sorry I'll stop cooking I mean
[10:57:11] this could also be finina who sinned and
[10:57:13] then something happened and she got
[10:57:14] cursed they're like [ __ ] you you're not
[10:57:15] the archon anymore I don't know it was
[10:57:17] Co it's Kobi sorry calm down I mean we
[10:57:19] just know she doesn't have a uh not
[10:57:22] Vision what's the
[10:57:24] wordi neosis we know she doesn't have
[10:57:26] that
[10:57:27] so probably something there she
[10:57:29] definitely sinned I don't know what the
[10:57:31] [ __ ] happened or maybe the other one s
[10:57:32] and cursed her it's one of the two
[10:57:34] 50/50 well if I guess I have a 50%
[10:57:37] chance of I'm going to check on what's
[10:57:38] happening with the Spina you know how it
[10:57:40] is there's some things you just need to
[10:57:42] be there for yourself I was distracted

[11:00:40] disciple that the first step to being a
[11:00:42] great astrologist pupil was to change
[11:00:45] that name there was nothing for it
[11:00:47] really she really is amazing at
[11:00:49] astrology so I changed my name to what
[11:00:51] it is now according to her wishes to my
[11:00:54] surprise however magistus is not the
[11:00:57] name of some ancient house or Clan uh
[11:01:01] it isn't nope although it is in place of
[11:01:05] surnames It generally just means great
[11:01:07] okay wow imagine including a boast in
[11:01:11] your name I reckon so in any case I'd
[11:01:15] give my disciple a name like this as
[11:01:17] well if I were to take one and I may ask
[11:01:19] what your master's name is astromancer
[11:01:22] barbalo Tris
[11:01:25] magistus what whoa that's a long one my
[11:01:29] name means Mona the great astrologist as
[11:01:33] for the old hag hers is in plain speech
[11:01:36] the Thrice as great scholar of the Stars
[11:01:39] just take it as a title specific to
[11:01:41] astrologists the is great that's so
[11:01:45] petty I know right that's just how she
[11:01:49] is she used to call herself magistus
[11:01:52] actually but when she took me in she
[11:01:55] changed her name to Tris magistus okay
[11:01:58] cool that excessive
[11:02:02] magistus is thus the calling card of our
[11:02:04] school so to speak which makes it about
[11:02:07] the same as a surname it's all right if
[11:02:09] you don't get it you can look into it
[11:02:11] further should you need to study
[11:02:12] astrology more deeply how about triple
[11:02:15] strength traveler that sounds
[11:02:18] terrible but anyway you're not Fontan
[11:02:20] are you Mona you're well I was born in
[11:02:22] monstad yes my parents migrated to
[11:02:25] Dorman port and I traveled with the old
[11:02:27] hag for a while after which I settled
[11:02:30] down down in monat city oh that's a good
[11:02:33] thing then at least we know you won't be
[11:02:35] dissolved by fontaine's
[11:02:37] Waters speaking of that I'm sure you're
[11:02:40] aware that a bunch of things have
[11:02:42] happened here in Fontaine right I know
[11:02:44] you're not a local but I'd avoid getting
[11:02:47] too close to any water that looks
[11:02:48] strange all the same there's something
[11:02:51] ominous about it the water I
[11:02:55] mean do you come to find it because of
[11:02:57] the prophecy mot that was the main
[11:02:59] reason yes
[11:03:01] just a while back the steam bird invited
[11:03:04] part in a panel speak about the C of the
[11:03:06] prophecy as an
[11:03:08] astrologist the invitation was sent
[11:03:10] quite early on I don't think anyone
[11:03:13] expected Fontaine to be in this much
[11:03:15] trouble what do you make of that
[11:03:17] prophecy Mona just tell us what you
[11:03:19] think as an astrologist your word would
[11:03:21] go a long way to make things more
[11:03:23] certain and less scary what I can tell
[11:03:26] you is that I'm an
[11:03:28] astrologist and that this prophecy
[11:03:30] concerns the fate of Fontaine even that
[11:03:33] of
[11:03:34] Alat ascertaining this is akin to
[11:03:37] reading the fortune of the whole world
[11:03:40] I'm afraid that this is not something
[11:03:42] that just anyone can do if I could do it
[11:03:44] you would no longer call me an
[11:03:46] astrologist but a Visionary wait so
[11:03:49] what's the point of side the prophecy is
[11:03:51] so huge and Powerful that it must surely
[11:03:54] come from a powerful Visionary its
[11:03:57] contents involve the fate of the world
[11:03:59] is regarding it would be a mistake a
[11:04:03] Visionary sounds really powerful and all
[11:04:06] but does such a person really
[11:04:08] exist of course the old hag could do it
[11:04:12] and I'd bet there are others amongst
[11:04:14] those hexen zerkal colleagues of hers
[11:04:16] who could do something
[11:04:18] similar I need to ascertain the accuracy
[11:04:21] of the prophecy could you help me get in
[11:04:23] touch with your
[11:04:24] master are you
[11:04:28] sure wait do we get to meet mod boss
[11:04:30] I'll help you it isn't often that I see
[11:04:33] you with such a serious look on your
[11:04:35] face I'll tell you once I hear back from
[11:04:37] her thanks Mona you're amazing as always

[11:06:12] please go see for
[11:06:15] yourself oh they're fighting
[11:06:20] no like I said I've already explained
[11:06:24] everything and yet the problem has not
[11:06:27] been properly solved there is little
[11:06:29] space for excuses between us it is not
[11:06:32] my intention to offend you but please
[11:06:35] tell me where you stand oh no you are
[11:06:37] the hydro archan falor are you not look
[11:06:41] at this this is a list of the victims
[11:06:44] from the recent P incident look I love
[11:06:47] you and I love finina but just assume
[11:06:50] for the rest of this Quest it's not her
[11:06:52] fault but just assume that she's useless
[11:06:54] I don't mean it in a disrespectful
[11:06:56] manner it's probably not her fault I
[11:06:58] don't know the lore but given all the
[11:07:00] the clues we have she probably can't do
[11:07:02] anything okay because why else would she
[11:07:04] act like she has a plan in front of in
[11:07:06] front of the Nave arino when she has
[11:07:08] nothing let's just listen she might
[11:07:10] listen I could be wrong I love finina I
[11:07:12] am a finina lover till the day I die
[11:07:15] okay I'm just saying for your own sake
[11:07:17] nevet just proceed
[11:07:21] alone we'll see I'm sorry we'll
[11:07:23] see you mean they're
[11:07:28] all
[11:07:30] we did not arrive in time to avert This
[11:07:32] Disaster and I will not have I don't
[11:07:35] know I assume it's not her fault there's
[11:07:36] probably going to be lore behind her but
[11:07:37] like I assume she just can't do anything
[11:07:38] but it's not her fault I will say this
[11:07:40] once more was like no one knows she
[11:07:42] can't do anything everything you know
[11:07:44] yesterday I found three stone slates in
[11:07:47] some ancient ruins near Pon do you know
[11:07:50] anything about those like arino was mean
[11:07:52] but she was kind of cooking what you was
[11:07:54] mean seriously you're questioning me
[11:07:56] like this is a court case now I don't
[11:07:59] know anything anything about
[11:08:01] that but you found them in some ancient
[11:08:05] ruins you say that's correct which is
[11:08:08] why I came to ask you some question a
[11:08:10] heated there should have been four
[11:08:11] slates but one of them was missing a
[11:08:14] heated rebuttal featured different
[11:08:15] images that seem to correlate to the
[11:08:18] prophecy the
[11:08:22] prophecy the second of these slates
[11:08:24] depicts the previous Hydro archon aeria
[11:08:26] kneeling before a floating island in the
[11:08:28] sky as if confessing something do you
[11:08:31] know nothing of this either I don't I've
[11:08:34] never seen such slates I'll ask you
[11:08:38] again do you really have no information
[11:08:41] regarding the previous archon my
[11:08:44] deciphering of the slates indicates that
[11:08:46] the hydro Aron aeria once had to confess
[11:08:48] to or apologize for a certain sin if
[11:08:53] anyone would know about it it should be
[11:08:55] you all gods don't have the same secrets
[11:08:58] you know she was herself and I'm me is
[11:09:02] it really so strange that I know nothing
[11:09:05] I understand your concerns but I'm sorry
[11:09:09] I just don't have anything to tell
[11:09:12] you dude if I'm never let I'm
[11:09:17] pissed imagine you're you're you're
[11:09:19] [ __ ] this now lady finina but I have
[11:09:21] long known of your various secret
[11:09:23] investigations into certain
[11:09:25] matters dude imagine your AR your whole
[11:09:28] nation's going to like die by Drowning
[11:09:30] to a prophecy and your archon I guess
[11:09:33] maybe I mean we'll see or literally your
[11:09:35] archon's like yeah I don't know anything
[11:09:37] there are several indications he you're
[11:09:39] a [ __ ] Hydro Dragon that's just
[11:09:40] saving everyone this is not strange in
[11:09:43] itself considering that you are the
[11:09:45] hydro Aron but it is strange that you
[11:09:48] should also claim to not know any of
[11:09:50] aia's Secrets as well as do nothing
[11:09:52] following your inquiries you have never
[11:09:55] been as superficial as you have
[11:09:56] presented yourself I know she's trying
[11:09:58] though nor are you a fool and yet your
[11:10:02] behavior is very inconsistent
[11:10:09] true so you've been watching me all this
[11:10:12] time have you I didn't think you were
[11:10:14] that tight he's a tier three sub fin he
[11:10:16] watches your streams you well since you
[11:10:19] know about my secret
[11:10:21] investigations you know I'm actually
[11:10:23] working to take care of it there's no
[11:10:26] point
[11:10:27] question me you're the but you're still
[11:10:30] my subordinate you should be following
[11:10:33] my lead just trust in me you're archon
[11:10:37] and do as I say never mind whether you
[11:10:39] can truly convince yourself to or not
[11:10:42] it'll all turn out
[11:10:44] fine yeah I don't know about that one
[11:10:46] fre that's all I have to say we do not
[11:10:49] discuss this matter again y
[11:10:52] [Music]
[11:10:55] yo oh the Opera is about to start who
[11:11:00] knows bro if I'm theet I quit [ __ ] it
[11:11:04] bro [ __ ] it I just saved the whole
[11:11:05] nation I saved I saved your [ __ ]
[11:11:08] General and I saved
[11:11:11] everyone [ __ ] this I'm going to [ __ ]
[11:11:14] mon no us standing by the door wonder
[11:11:17] what's up with her she was
[11:11:20] smiling huh she didn't seem in the mood
[11:11:23] to care if we were listening in or not
[11:11:25] she seems deeply troubled she seems to
[11:11:27] be deliberately hiding something
[11:11:32] I assume you've been outside for a while
[11:11:35] now oh you noticed seems finina didn't
[11:11:39] even realize we were
[11:11:41] here she was in a great Panic though I
[11:11:44] cannot discern the reason our discussion
[11:11:46] reached impasses time and again okay
[11:11:49] okay I'm sorry not to break immersion
[11:11:51] I'm sorry I don't want to break
[11:11:53] immersion but first time chatter King
[11:11:56] gamer 111 says is it just me or are
[11:11:59] there no actual ladies on genin bro what
[11:12:03] yo yo what are you saying have you not
[11:12:06] seen like half the Gin characters I'm
[11:12:08] sorry I'm sorry let me keep going let's
[11:12:10] not get this right I'm sorry I please
[11:12:12] look up in your Google search bar look
[11:12:14] up uh b b e i d o u also you can look up
[11:12:18] uh y y a e space m i k o actually look
[11:12:21] up Electro characters if you want uh all
[11:12:23] of them or most of them uh you could
[11:12:25] also look up arino DEA yolan anyways uh
[11:12:29] I I missed a bit of what he said in
[11:12:31] great Panic though I cannot discern the
[11:12:32] reason our discussion reached imp passes
[11:12:33] this time time and time and again a
[11:12:35] state of affairs we cannot allow to
[11:12:36] continue still I do not understand
[11:12:40] dialogue is the basis for understanding
[11:12:42] so why did she keep refusing to engage
[11:12:45] true I'm uh afraid questions alone might
[11:12:48] not suffice we need to make her
[11:12:50] understand how dire the situation is
[11:12:52] everyone in her Inner Circle has noticed
[11:12:54] that she is hiding some secret the issue
[11:12:57] is her attitude just too true I fear
[11:12:59] fear that she will not reveal anything
[11:13:00] unless absolutely forced
[11:13:03] to okay we may have to create a
[11:13:06] situation in which she will have no
[11:13:08] choice but to speak oh like what
[11:13:13] normally people will only reveal the
[11:13:15] truth when standing trial perhaps we
[11:13:17] must have the hydro experience just such
[11:13:21] a scenario no I mean you should I agree
[11:13:23] but she's going to cry you're going to
[11:13:25] put on trial you're going to embarrass
[11:13:26] her in front of everyone she's going to
[11:13:27] admit the truth she's going to cry and
[11:13:28] then everyone's going to be sad
[11:13:30] the I'll shut
[11:13:33] up we will need to consider this
[11:13:35] thoroughly join forces with various
[11:13:37] parties and then do what we
[11:13:41] can if at all possible I would prefer to
[11:13:44] recuse myself from this affair but we
[11:13:47] must prevent the prophecy yeah literally
[11:13:49] she's going to reveal everything it's
[11:13:49] going to be sad she's going to start
[11:13:50] crying then like it's going to be like
[11:13:52] she be like I hate you never let then
[11:13:54] we're going to leave the Opera and then
[11:13:56] it's going to start raining we like and
[11:13:57] Pyon Pyon dumbass like it must be the
[11:14:00] Hydro
[11:14:01] Dragon to her but all Fontaine is in
[11:14:04] crisis the information a god possesses
[11:14:07] is too precious and so we must take a
[11:14:10] chance on this in this case we will need
[11:14:12] help but who will lend us their aid to
[11:14:15] do such a thing oh I know who to
[11:14:22] call oh PA trap who do we call Shia
[11:14:25] clarent Navia
[11:14:27] rizzly saw Goodman
[11:14:30] speaking of which it was pretty smart of
[11:14:32] you to think of hiding
[11:14:35] here where theu invol in a disaster
[11:14:38] presently devoid of people and here you
[11:14:41] are it's the most natural thing in the
[11:14:43] world huh that's what family should do
[11:14:46] sit and enjoy a leisurely time together
[11:14:50] true it's nice to enjoy tea here you
[11:14:52] know care for a
[11:14:55] cup lend
[11:14:58] everyone hm or perhaps one of you might
[11:15:02] like to start us off how about you
[11:15:04] friends oh there he is hello NAIA
[11:15:07] me no I don't think I
[11:15:12] can then how about you good
[11:15:16] sir I fear that I will cause the mood on
[11:15:19] this boat to become as somber as it is
[11:15:21] in
[11:15:23] court well then I guess we're lucky
[11:15:26] we've got a local like me to organize
[11:15:28] things wonderful the spotlight At Last I
[11:15:32] guess I'll be facilitating things from
[11:15:35] here that was a little longwinded don't
[11:15:37] you think hello oh you might be right
[11:15:41] anyway to cut to the chase our friend
[11:15:44] here the traveler has brought us
[11:15:45] together to discuss something
[11:15:48] hey as for what that is well let's start
[11:15:52] by saying that we'll be pulling our
[11:15:54] efforts together to create a series of
[11:15:58] traps oh how
[11:16:01] intriguing well it's just an expression
[11:16:04] really one that I just learned from
[11:16:06] choran wait why'd you learn an
[11:16:07] expression fromen so let's invite her to
[11:16:10] explain in detail a round of applause
[11:16:15] please that's
[11:16:18] suspicious huh didn't you say that you
[11:16:21] would be facilitating this oh come now
[11:16:25] your work doesn't involve much public
[11:16:27] speaking right this is
[11:16:29] y yo you might even pick up some fancy
[11:16:33] oratory tra yo your hats are literally
[11:16:34] touching back
[11:16:36] up I see and what does my boss
[11:16:41] say he is glad that you consider him
[11:16:44] your boss do go
[11:16:54] on in that
[11:16:56] case do any of you have experiened
[11:17:00] hunting not that I recall frem and I
[11:17:03] once used a wooden stick in a basket to
[11:17:05] catch wild rabbits when we were younger
[11:17:07] as for Lynette um oh right you were sick
[11:17:12] that day weren't you uh I've also Gone
[11:17:15] Diving to catch some fish before uh I've
[11:17:19] also gone sorry I'm afraid not you may
[11:17:24] or may not have heard but Fontaine once
[11:17:26] played host to a group known as the Maro
[11:17:31] Hunters they did not hunt animals but
[11:17:34] rather various monsters left behind by
[11:17:36] the ancient dynasty of King Remis dude
[11:17:39] no way fontaine's monster population has
[11:17:41] already thinned greatly so the hunters
[11:17:43] have Blended back into society taking up
[11:17:46] arms in other lines of work they even
[11:17:49] left a unique methodology of hunting in
[11:17:51] their wake a trap comprises of the
[11:17:54] following bait a trigger and a
[11:17:57] containment device
[11:17:59] sometimes a lethal Implement will also
[11:18:01] be necessary to deal with the prey so if
[11:18:04] we were to build a trap together right
[11:18:07] now what would you choose to build it
[11:18:09] with for me I would prefer something
[11:18:13] basket shaped pigeons and rabbits will
[11:18:15] see the bait and naturally enter the
[11:18:18] snare our line of work requires a deaf
[11:18:21] hand and we're some of the best in the
[11:18:23] industry so you can count on our
[11:18:26] techniques you use some of those
[11:18:28] techniques while moving the people of
[11:18:30] Pon didn't you my subordinates mentioned
[11:18:33] that you even perform have to design a
[11:18:34] trap children yes what if we do manage
[11:18:38] to gather some intelligence in the me
[11:18:40] what if we do we take a character we
[11:18:42] take an attractive character and then in
[11:18:44] order for Fel to get baited we make it
[11:18:46] to where the character you can get them
[11:18:48] but you have to spend a currency we're
[11:18:50] going to call these currencies a a bro
[11:18:53] bems and in order to get them you have
[11:18:55] to spend you have to either play all day
[11:18:57] or spend real life money and then you
[11:19:00] will fall into the trap looking for the
[11:19:03] one character you want and end up incap
[11:19:05] in the Whirl poool of the GTA system
[11:19:08] sorry I'm afraid I can't claim that as
[11:19:11] my strong
[11:19:12] suit I prefer more stable methods like
[11:19:16] placing bait in the water and waiting
[11:19:18] for the fish to come within
[11:19:21] reach that's the kind of method I would
[11:19:24] count
[11:19:25] on calm and steady exactly the kind and
[11:19:29] I can be their
[11:19:31] assistant with discretion I'm sure H I'd
[11:19:36] probably use some sort of mechanical
[11:19:38] animal Papa once bought me some small
[11:19:40] Clockwork squirrels mice and such when
[11:19:42] placed in the forest they can attract
[11:19:44] others of their kind I remember that you
[11:19:47] like those too didn't
[11:19:49] you I did and that would be a good way
[11:19:53] to go about it if they're realistic
[11:19:55] enough animals of the same kind will
[11:19:57] follow them all the way to the Trap what
[11:20:00] about you miss
[11:20:01] net I fear I do not have any related
[11:20:05] experience or he's literally an otter
[11:20:07] that makes sense you usually solve
[11:20:09] problems directly without the use of any
[11:20:12] such tricks but I do have one more
[11:20:14] question for you
[11:20:16] miss if we were to create a trap now how
[11:20:19] would you design
[11:20:21] it I would like for it to be effective
[11:20:24] but bring no harm to the prey a more
[11:20:27] gentle louder dude the problem with my
[11:20:30] soundboard this is the time talk about
[11:20:31] it however Our intention doesn't
[11:20:34] necessarily change the [ __ ] yes it is I
[11:20:36] hear it really loud but you guys don't
[11:20:38] so if I make it louder it destroys my
[11:20:39] ears and there I don't know what to do
[11:20:40] about
[11:20:42] it anyways let's keep
[11:20:46] going if we wanted to kill the prey in
[11:20:48] one strike we would need a powerful
[11:20:51] Implement however that also goes for
[11:20:53] prey that must be captured and safely
[11:20:56] contained wait why is that
[11:20:59] that only a hunter who's a true expert
[11:21:01] at subduing their prey can snare it with
[11:21:04] am I [ __ ] stupid I just realized
[11:21:05] they're talking about like luring finina
[11:21:08] I just realized they're doing all this
[11:21:09] for finina am I stupid this will be like
[11:21:11] 20 minutes I'm
[11:21:13] stupid so are we going hunting together
[11:21:17] I was
[11:21:18] like huh we hadn't thought of seeing
[11:21:21] ourselves as Hunters it kind of works
[11:21:24] but maybe it's still not the best
[11:21:26] metaphor if our means of capturing and
[11:21:29] dealing with our preise to put them on
[11:21:31] trial and the hunting metaphor is
[11:21:33] actually quite accurate at least I said
[11:21:35] it before let much more courage than any
[11:21:37] hunter to judge a god a being whose seat
[11:21:40] is an exalted Throne that's right oh so
[11:21:44] that's what's going on sounds very
[11:21:49] interesting Florence hunting metaphor
[11:21:50] was just that a metaphor okay I can
[11:21:52] click to continue thank God was just
[11:21:53] that a metaphor you will not call this a
[11:21:55] hunt because that is not what you should
[11:21:56] do at the present nor has the
[11:21:58] relationship between you and finina
[11:22:00] reached such a dire stage first of all
[11:22:02] who the [ __ ] is talking to us right now
[11:22:04] is this D Leaf would you need is simply
[11:22:07] the secrets she is keeping attempting to
[11:22:08] take Secrets is an act of sacriligious
[11:22:11] disrespect but must be done to prevent
[11:22:13] Fontan from sinking into the waters as
[11:22:15] foretold in the prophecy there is
[11:22:18] neither Hunter nor prey but there must
[11:22:21] be a trap this is what you will
[11:22:24] need Mar chose Hunter dude what's with g
[11:22:28] and having random NPCs of the saddest
[11:22:31] lore I'm
[11:22:33] [Music]
[11:22:38] sorry it's been a tough few days hasn't
[11:22:40] it so much why is that girl taller than
[11:22:43] Shia yeah that's a ban mods destroy him
[11:22:46] mods find his house no don't don't I'm
[11:22:48] sorry I that was a silver wolf moment I
[11:22:50] apologize don't do that those meetings
[11:22:52] sure did make me
[11:22:54] hungry H didn't think the meetings would
[11:22:56] go on for so long but everyone seemed
[11:22:58] pretty fired up huh Pon thought they'd
[11:23:01] be at least a little frightened well
[11:23:04] fine was now that Pon thinks about it
[11:23:06] but everyone else just looked you feel
[11:23:08] more confident after with meetings Pon
[11:23:09] uh well it's hard to say Pon doesn't
[11:23:12] have any experience with this sort of
[11:23:14] thing but with you around Pon sure will
[11:23:16] do great after all you're the most
[11:23:18] reliable person in the world aren't you
[11:23:21] something wrong Pon did you just pour
[11:23:23] some key P didn't notice you doing that
[11:23:26] at all uh-oh oh my God it's like the
[11:23:28] last Aron Quest we did where like the
[11:23:30] macaroon scene was like oh my God the
[11:23:32] person ate a macaroon now someone poured
[11:23:34] tea wait fina's here what is either
[11:23:38] finina or or arino place your bets I've
[11:23:40] never seen that cup before wait never
[11:23:41] mind it's a red cup who frightened I'm
[11:23:44] just joining you to for tea I merely
[11:23:47] refrained from saying anything till now

[11:23:51] is this I've never met have I met
[11:23:54] them

[11:24:15] not real or wander at both the voice
[11:24:16] from the sky H I fear that description
[11:24:20] is wrong so not completely
[11:24:24] wrong you're feeling lost now just as
[11:24:28] you were feeling
[11:24:30] previously I sensed that confusion and
[11:24:33] thus came to you guiding people is an
[11:24:36] irresistible hobby of mine after all
[11:24:39] yeah I made guides too hey the name is
[11:24:42] who are you and what do you want with us
[11:24:44] consider me a passerby just accepting a
[11:24:47] commission from my friend's disciple on

[11:25:01] prophecy come true the prophecy yes has
[11:25:05] been prophesized will be fulfilled you

[11:25:10] the
[11:25:11] future

[11:25:15] future stop it I believe you have

[11:25:25] changed there it is again fate can there
[11:25:28] really be no
[11:25:29] exceptions so you've caught on just as
[11:25:33] prophecies are usually only the future
[11:25:35] as seen from the perspectives of the
[11:25:37] Gods wait is Bren in this game yet be
[11:25:40] happening in Hidden Corners where the
[11:25:42] God's gaze does not fall are the things

[11:25:47] Fate that the gods purs it's AI Island

[11:26:03] scary the it was just about gone wait
[11:26:06] those a d Lea fly I believe that you
[11:26:09] understand right some things are
[11:26:12] insignificant but others you must reach

[11:27:33] like it's okay we're going to make a new
[11:27:35] account soon we're going to do all the
[11:27:36] quests again uh because uh we're going
[11:27:38] to have a second account true how have
[11:27:39] you been the past few days mon fine just
[11:27:42] fine I went to take part in that steam
[11:27:44] bird panel it turned out to be more
[11:27:48] interesting than I expected mentioned
[11:27:50] the carry be Quest I remember all of car
[11:27:52] bar is like my favorite quest one
[11:27:54] mentioned that sitting around and
[11:27:56] waiting for the end to come would be
[11:27:57] wrong and that they should make their
[11:27:59] own rescue preparations I agreed so we
[11:28:02] had a brief chat with her uh did she
[11:28:05] have pink hair by any chance why yes it
[11:28:09] was Charlotte you remember her right
[11:28:12] that Daredevil
[11:28:14] journalist I'm in full support of her
[11:28:16] view prophecies are very important but
[11:28:19] how can people allow their lives to be
[11:28:21] commandeered by just a few
[11:28:23] words that's right Hon's glad to hear
[11:28:26] something sensible for
[11:28:29] once ah yes about what we had discussed
[11:28:32] before I did try but I'm afraid I
[11:28:35] couldn't reach the old hag I'll try
[11:28:37] again tonight but I wouldn't get your
[11:28:39] hopes up actually someone already came
[11:28:42] over huh huh sorry you tell Mona about
[11:28:46] your mysterious
[11:28:47] guest goodness gracious are you serious
[11:28:51] I believe she came to pass a message to
[11:28:54] us she said that even the God's gate has
[11:28:56] blind spots pretty pretty bold if you
[11:28:58] ask Pon most people would believe the
[11:29:01] gods to be all knowing right the hexen
[11:29:03] circle members are certainly anything
[11:29:06] but
[11:29:06] ordinary as for the Mage named n the old
[11:29:10] hag has mentioned her a few times she
[11:29:12] said what do she sound more British now
[11:29:14] they just not notice it incredible and
[11:29:16] that she loves guiding those who are
[11:29:18] lost but I've never met her and if she
[11:29:21] were still alive she'd be well suffice
[11:29:26] it to say that the hags at least a few
[11:29:28] now and n's been around for longer than
[11:29:30] that whoa the hexen circle sounds like a
[11:29:34] scary group but they must really stay in
[11:29:37] shape to live so long their abilities
[11:29:40] alone are pretty terrifying if she came
[11:29:43] to see you personally then the problem
[11:29:45] you're facing must truly be of great
[11:29:48] importance well it's not like Pon could
[11:29:50] understand anything she
[11:29:52] said
[11:29:54] transatlantic but I suspect she means
[11:29:57] that there is still a way to turn things
[11:29:58] around hey good for Atlantic she didn't
[11:30:00] say when or what that would be though so
[11:30:03] that's
[11:30:05] awesome okay Perhaps it is something
[11:30:07] that you cannot know right
[11:30:10] now true her words meant uh as a helpful
[11:30:13] hint but when will they realize
[11:30:15] that what was the best answer that my
[11:30:18] question could have gotten or sorry was
[11:30:20] that the best answer that my question
[11:30:21] could have gotten traveler Pon are you
[11:30:24] two all right oh we're fine we're just a
[11:30:28] little down right now it kind of feels
[11:30:30] like the end is coming you know I see I
[11:30:35] feel end is coming of desperation
[11:30:40] [Applause]
[11:30:45] too the end is coming sorry I had PTSD
[11:30:49] from that I guess you could consider me
[11:30:51] someone who has often witnessed fate so
[11:30:54] far as I have seen it cannot be swayed
[11:30:58] but even so I still hope for and Believe
[11:31:02] In
[11:31:03] Miracles astrology is eternal and
[11:31:07] rational but fate may not be it is cruel
[11:31:11] but it can also be beautiful so true
[11:31:15] speaking of was trying to tell you not
[11:31:18] to lose heart and to believe that what
[11:31:20] you are seeing playing out before you is
[11:31:22] not yet set in stone I did originally
[11:31:25] think of steering clear of all this but
[11:31:27] I couldn't couldn't even if this is all
[11:31:29] futile I still wish to help everyone if
[11:31:32] we don't struggle to the last then how
[11:31:34] can we Face the end when it comes the
[11:31:37] end sorry you do have a
[11:31:40] point there I go talking about
[11:31:43] astrological principles again sorry
[11:31:45] about that the moment I start talking
[11:31:47] about work-related stuff oh I need to
[11:31:51] get going don't worry about it Mona
[11:31:52] thank you it was worth trying to comfort
[11:31:54] you even if only a little I believe that
[11:31:57] you'll help those who are struggling in
[11:31:59] the same way I did thanks mon if you
[11:32:01] ever need that might be why we always
[11:32:03] seem to meet by
[11:32:07] coincidence I mean was it really
[11:32:08] coincidence she feel kind of I mean I
[11:32:10] guess it was she didn't know we were
[11:32:11] here but also kind of sad too hey
[11:32:15] traveler Pon
[11:32:17] suddenly let's walk around the city
[11:32:19] shall we there's a few spots we always
[11:32:21] like to walk by okay GD Prince your
[11:32:23] message may have gotten deleted but you
[11:32:25] spoke the truth you got punished for
[11:32:27] speaking the truth actually upon reading
[11:32:28] it kind of harassment harisman so never
[11:32:31] mind I didn't fully read I read like
[11:32:32] half of it I read thighs I didn't read

[11:32:53] Quest yeah this the right Quest let P
[11:32:56] see the under water stronghold The
[11:32:58] Fortress of mpede has continued in its
[11:33:01] Noble autonomy but that does not mean
[11:33:03] that others cannot interact with it my
[11:33:06] recent attempts to enter the Fortress
[11:33:08] bore little fruit huh guess Charlotte
[11:33:11] still hasn't given up on that thus did
[11:33:13] an Outlander friend become the focus of
[11:33:15] this report a blonded frer with their
[11:33:18] white fairy Legends trailing in their
[11:33:20] wake it is said that this mysterious
[11:33:23] traveler once visited the underwater
[11:33:25] Fortress so while the Fortress is in ior
[11:33:28] remains a mystery behind closed doors do
[11:33:30] not fear for the tales of the journalist
[11:33:32] Charlotte's biggest scoop H Charlotte
[11:33:35] took so many she hasn't been able to get
[11:33:37] a hold of anything at the Fortress so
[11:33:39] since we're easier to find she's using

[11:37:15] anyways you should have glance at with
[11:37:17] Pon and snar down the cake it's more
[11:37:19] delicious than last time and the flavor
[11:37:22] gets even better with the sip of tea it
[11:37:24] sure would be nice if we could come
[11:37:26] again tomorrow
[11:37:27] sure it would be nice if we could always
[11:37:29] eat delicious food
[11:37:32] here wow if it isn't the traveler and
[11:37:35] Pon it's the article I wrote about you
[11:37:38] yeah but sounds cooler you got some
[11:37:40] nerve you just used us to make some
[11:37:42] quick MOA can we negotiate a profit
[11:37:45] split oh you needn't worry about that I
[11:37:47] heard that you were in Pon sometime back
[11:37:49] so I sent you a letter to discuss just
[11:37:51] that it appears you didn't receive it
[11:37:53] though it's all right though I've set
[11:37:55] aside the amount intended for you I've
[11:37:57] even set the table with some
[11:37:59] food
[11:38:01] really you're almost a little too easy
[11:38:04] to win over Pon if I were a journalist
[11:38:06] with ulterior motives you'd be in
[11:38:08] trouble now you know oh Pon knows you're
[11:38:11] not like that still what brings you here
[11:38:13] all of a sudden when Mona mentioned you
[11:38:15] we thought of coming to see you at work
[11:38:18] I see it seems you've already bumped
[11:38:19] into Mona here in Fontaine so she
[11:38:22] mentioned me what did she say she said
[11:38:24] that you're a real Daredevil of a
[11:38:29] journalist nice in which case can this
[11:38:32] Daredevil journalist dare to request an
[11:38:34] exclusive interview with the legendary
[11:38:36] traveler and Pon no huh so your article
[11:38:40] in the paper today doesn't count oh of
[11:38:43] course it doesn't that was more like
[11:38:45] live photography wa oh that was this
[11:38:46] Quest I thought that was part of L's
[11:38:48] Quest oh my bad seen and experience you
[11:38:51] seriously want to interview me yeah are
[11:38:53] we even qualified
[11:38:55] enough why not if I say you're worth an
[11:38:58] interview then you're worth it but not
[11:39:00] right now of course I'll need a few days
[11:39:02] to prepare should I order food chat it's
[11:39:04] 2 a.m. is there even anything open
[11:39:06] around me like everything closes
[11:39:08] here so that's a there's literally like
[11:39:11] nothing open tell the editor and chief
[11:39:13] immediately I'll have to apply for
[11:39:15] lighting and props
[11:39:18] and so much to get done now talk to you
[11:39:25] later wait Charlotte I'm might still got
[11:39:27] a question for
[11:39:29] you H and what's that if just for
[11:39:34] example Fontaine were to be flooded
[11:39:38] tomorrow dude shut the [ __ ]
[11:39:41] sorry huh that's the prophecy you're
[11:39:44] talking about isn't it I mean I do hear
[11:39:46] about it often but I've never once
[11:39:48] thought that the day could be
[11:39:50] tomorrow if you're seriously asking then
[11:39:53] I might try and think of a way to leave
[11:39:55] Fontaine oh but I'm still a a journalist
[11:39:57] first and foremost that means I have a
[11:39:59] duty to be reporting from the scene and
[11:40:01] secondly I wouldn't forsake my homeland
[11:40:04] that easily from what I've seen most
[11:40:07] people don't know what they do should
[11:40:08] the worst come to pass in truth it might
[11:40:11] be better just to behave like normal
[11:40:13] rather than worry over such an end so in
[11:40:16] all likelihood I'd probably still be
[11:40:18] prepping at the office for That
[11:40:19] interview of ours that is a good answer
[11:40:20] I know what you're thinking that sounds
[11:40:22] a bit sad but I've always believed that
[11:40:24] it's best to do what you enjoy just
[11:40:27] think about it if this nation really
[11:40:29] were to be suddenly destroyed tomorrow
[11:40:31] but I still suc an exclusive interview
[11:40:34] with a truly unique person then the
[11:40:36] story I would wind up writing would
[11:40:38] truly be timeless and then do you know
[11:40:41] what I'd do well I'd write that story
[11:40:43] send it for printing and use messenger
[11:40:45] pigeons to get copies out to the various
[11:40:46] Nations as soon as possible I'm not a
[11:40:49] dreamer nor am I a workaholic but I do
[11:40:52] love my job this is cool I kind of don't
[11:40:53] care I'm going to be honest but like
[11:40:55] inspirational so true I guess but anyway
[11:40:58] that's my answer and on that note I'll
[11:41:00] get back to my preparations
[11:41:04] cool that's so nice anyway let's go and
[11:41:08] take a look at the SE shall
[11:41:12] we
[11:41:15] okay shit's about to go down by the way
[11:41:17] I like when we do like 30 minutes of
[11:41:19] talking to random people just for like a
[11:41:21] bunch of [ __ ] to go down and then six
[11:41:22] people
[11:41:23] die Hon's been thinking no think Pon if
[11:41:27] it wasn't Fontaine but all of tat that
[11:41:30] would be destroyed
[11:41:31] tomorrow where would we go and what
[11:41:33] would we do no Pon should ask if you
[11:41:38] really Pon if all of tavat was destroyed
[11:41:41] what would we do Pon if all T has
[11:41:43] destroyed I won't be here
[11:41:48] sorry suddenly trying to consider what
[11:41:50] to do is this you've always been moving
[11:41:52] to the next destination so we haven't
[11:41:54] spent much time thinking about these
[11:41:56] kinds of things we didn't have to either
[11:41:59] with us always being on the road and
[11:42:01] whatnot until that until that moment
[11:42:04] comes I think I'll keep on journeying on
[11:42:06] let's Journey starward starward Hy star
[11:42:09] traveling yes cherish every moment I
[11:42:12] that I have to look upon this
[11:42:15] world wait isn't that what we've always
[11:42:17] been
[11:42:18] doing the banter goes back and forth
[11:42:20] the2 as the Time Slips by nightfalls you
[11:42:23] return your to your accommodations and
[11:42:25] end this busy
[11:42:28] day the next few days are just as calm

[11:42:32] the interview in the Spina D rosula safe
[11:42:35] house at
[11:42:36] flound Navia having finished her

[11:42:41] photo with the two of you all goes well
[11:42:43] all is well Clarin then comes over says
[11:42:46] Hey traveler are you that one streamer
[11:42:48] I'm a big
[11:42:51] fan feels like you'll grow mold if you
[11:42:54] stay here long enough but it's still
[11:42:57] better than the Fortress of mpede that's
[11:42:59] for sure it's not only so the two of you
[11:43:02] are still here wow Isadora oh you're
[11:43:05] from the meronia aren't you yes I'm
[11:43:09] Isadora NAD sent me to look for you two
[11:43:12] before I heard that afterward you went
[11:43:14] to the Fortress of merome you think
[11:43:15] we're
[11:43:16] criminals not at all I'm well aware that
[11:43:19] your friends something happen yes inside
[11:43:21] the Opera House the Mari chose Phantom
[11:43:24] has declared the incident a small scale
[11:43:26] Riot a riot well that said I don't
[11:43:31] personally think it was that serious
[11:43:33] what lady F was watching a performance
[11:43:36] at the opera house and while she was
[11:43:38] resting during an intermission some
[11:43:40] other audience members suddenly started
[11:43:42] harassing her loudly accusing her of
[11:43:45] doing nothing prophecy crisis and before
[11:43:49] she
[11:43:50] could join
[11:43:52] in added Riot the crowd continued to
[11:43:55] grow and protest against the hydro
[11:43:57] archon started to break out so people
[11:44:00] have started to put the blame on finina
[11:44:03] guess they finally found an outlet for
[11:44:05] the pressure they I can't add hoo that's
[11:44:07] [ __ ] I agree people will naturally
[11:44:11] rely on gods as is customary but the
[11:44:14] moment people feel threatened gods are
[11:44:16] also the first to be blamed so what
[11:44:19] happened after that is finina okay
[11:44:21] seeing that the situation was spiraling
[11:44:23] out of control in spiral Abyss pointless
[11:44:27] she claimed that she'd gotten tired of
[11:44:29] this and left in a hurry the marish Jo
[11:44:32] Phantom had their hands full maintaining
[11:44:34] order and did not catch where lady
[11:44:36] finina had gone only when things had
[11:44:38] stabilized did we realize that she had
[11:44:40] gone missing so a second you mean she's
[11:44:44] still missing how do we let finina go
[11:44:46] missing that's right the mar has
[11:44:49] dispatched many people to search for her
[11:44:51] but we don't have any leads yet that
[11:44:54] said I don't think there's much much to
[11:44:56] worry about she is a God after all even
[11:45:00] if she were to fall into the hands of
[11:45:01] rioter what could ordinary people do to
[11:45:04] her bro she almost died to arino like 5
[11:45:06] days ago what do you mean what could
[11:45:07] ordinary literally anyone bro it's
[11:45:09] finina find her what the [ __ ] she should
[11:45:11] be literally locked in her room
[11:45:13] literally nlet has to have her if I say
[11:45:16] on a leash you guys will take it in a
[11:45:17] weird way nlet literally should have his
[11:45:19] eye on her 24/7 we can't lose our
[11:45:22] [ __ ] archon cuz she got kidnapped by
[11:45:24] arino while she was chasing a cat
[11:45:27] I understand the situation good M nervet
[11:45:31] sent me to tell you about the situation
[11:45:33] but he didn't say anything else don't
[11:45:36] worry this is more than enough to go on
[11:45:38] thanks for keeping us
[11:45:40] informed is that so well all right then
[11:45:44] in that case Okay Chad I'm ordering
[11:45:46] poutin [ __ ] it it'll be here in 40
[11:45:47] minutes I'm hungry but I don't want to
[11:45:49] eat while doing the quest but I'll have
[11:45:51] it for after cuz everything closes and I
[11:45:52] don't feel like cooking at 4:00 a.m.
[11:45:54] that's how I'm done sounds like we
[11:45:55] should hurry over to put Sal
[11:45:59] in you sure caught on quickly if we know
[11:46:03] finina she won't try to fix things in
[11:46:05] this situation you're going to save food
[11:46:06] for 4 hours I mean so look for a place
[11:46:08] to wait out the heat I guess I might eat
[11:46:10] mid I don't know I'm just going to order
[11:46:12] she may be loud and dramatic but she
[11:46:14] doesn't have a Heart of
[11:46:18] Stone when nervala was talking to her in
[11:46:21] the p meronia and she heard about P she
[11:46:25] couldn't hide herself sadness and
[11:46:27] remorse it would be hard for her to
[11:46:30] ignore being accused by the public hon
[11:46:33] thinks Fin's probably taking the
[11:46:35] opportunity to slip away to pul and try
[11:46:38] to relieve the sense of guilt that she's
[11:46:40] feeling H well what do you think Pon
[11:46:43] knows the answer of course but Pon can
[11:46:45] do in that case
[11:46:47] there's okay don't really care about
[11:46:49] what Pon has to say now what find finina
[11:46:51] bog wait why I like how we like how it's

[11:49:07] archon I must teach them a

[11:52:04] shaking is it an
[11:52:09] earthquake another disaster just trucked
[11:52:11] I suspect yeah a quake of this kind
[11:52:14] preceded the flooding in Pon didn't
[11:52:17] it it can't be it's happening again well
[11:52:22] there's no need to worry too much about
[11:52:24] that nolet's made emergency plan so the
[11:52:27] evacuation should go a lot smoother this
[11:52:29] time bro at at a certain point when we
[11:52:31] go to save every [ __ ] region from
[11:52:33] their archon or the prophecy or the
[11:52:34] [ __ ] the the Tor like at some point
[11:52:37] we can just be like look look I'm a
[11:52:39] traveler I'm just here for tourism I'm
[11:52:41] out like why do we have to solve Every
[11:52:43] Nation I'm sorry yeah keep playing I
[11:52:47] hope you're
[11:52:48] right but the people of P leave
[11:52:54] already has fre finally reached her
[11:52:56] limit now that she's talking about her
[11:52:58] actual feelings she's starting to look
[11:53:00] far less Stiff The Jig Is up you be a to
[11:53:03] talk Among Us yourselves for call I've
[11:53:07] been investigating the prophecy for
[11:53:09] hundreds of years I once had informants
[11:53:12] all over to vat searching for Clues and
[11:53:15] feeding information back to me I've
[11:53:18] tried all kinds of ways too to hold back
[11:53:21] the sea anything to keep the coastline
[11:53:24] from advancing but all my efforts prove
[11:53:27] to be futile in the end really the truth
[11:53:31] has been clear to me for a very long
[11:53:34] time we cannot make an enemy of the
[11:53:37] Divine no matter what we do the will of
[11:53:40] the Heavenly principles will have its
[11:53:42] way and the prophecy shall be fulfilled
[11:53:46] stop and get it up right give
[11:53:50] up I do love the sound of that phrase it
[11:53:54] would mean finally coming to terms with
[11:53:56] fate but also for me to finally be free
[11:54:01] but that would also mean that all hope
[11:54:03] would disappear and we must hold on to
[11:54:05] hope for I've thought about giving up so
[11:54:09] many times especially after we almost
[11:54:12] lost Pon fate is really unreasonable
[11:54:16] isn't it it has no heart and obeys no
[11:54:20] rules the prophecy has only just started
[11:54:23] to come true and so so many people have
[11:54:26] already lost their lives wait a second
[11:54:28] so we're beefing with Celestia right cuz
[11:54:30] of the prophecy okay and we're getting
[11:54:31] shev next patch and shev has a musket
[11:54:34] and she's America she represents America
[11:54:35] which means we're getting America Next
[11:54:37] patch so hypothetically couldn't we just
[11:54:39] nuke Celestia what if we just fired a
[11:54:42] nuclear missile and we just America all
[11:54:44] over Celestia can't we just isn't that
[11:54:47] freedom listen Hey listen hey wouldn't
[11:54:49] we win Fino would be saved the prophecy
[11:54:51] won't be fulfilled hell yeah brother
[11:54:54] sorry it all became clear to me I still
[11:54:59] don't have the right to come to terms
[11:55:01] with fate on behalf of everyone else as
[11:55:04] long as the final moment hasn't come
[11:55:07] it's still not too late don't worry I I
[11:55:12] will keep hope alive for everyone until
[11:55:14] the very
[11:55:18] end well that's enough for now I got the
[11:55:22] impulse to play the stricken Maiden but
[11:55:26] honestly considering my rank and station
[11:55:29] bro is she okay what yo what the f she
[11:55:32] literally switches just take any of what
[11:55:34] I just said no wonder it cost no stamina
[11:55:36] when you charge tax stamina to the whims
[11:55:39] of trivial prophecy she's used to it
[11:55:43] come on Pon could have sworn you were
[11:55:46] actually being honest just
[11:55:49] now time we can't go back I more
[11:55:52] information out of her finina you might
[11:55:54] not have to shoulder this burden alone
[11:55:55] although I don't know what you might be
[11:55:56] keeping from everyone your people are
[11:55:57] more than willing to share the burden
[11:55:59] with you my burden that's impossible it
[11:56:03] was faded right from the start that this
[11:56:05] would be my duty
[11:56:09] alone but even if your burden doesn't
[11:56:11] need to be shared you can still choose
[11:56:12] to confide in
[11:56:14] someone just share it with me I'm what
[11:56:16] you call a
[11:56:18] witness yes I've heard that you came to
[11:56:22] to that from beyond the stars yes in
[11:56:25] other words

[11:56:29] of [ __ ] up to say that is in its
[11:56:31] entirety a show on a stage then you're

[11:57:21] that's it's show time sorry that's
[11:57:24] [ __ ] that's actually
[11:57:26] [ __ ] Lenny did the thing though ladies

[11:57:31] performance now without further Ado we
[11:57:35] may proceed to the trial of our
[11:57:38] God wait wait I have it I have so this
[11:57:41] is what it is yes you deserve praise for
[11:57:45] the effort you took to raise the
[11:57:47] dramatic Stakes do not forget however
[11:57:51] that I am falor the god of Justice the
[11:57:55] embodiment of Justice itself does it not
[11:57:59] strike you as even the least bit absurd
[11:58:01] to bring the very concept of Justice to
[11:58:05] trial may I interpret these words as
[11:58:08] your refusal to stand trial in that case
[11:58:12] you will have the opportunity to defend
[11:58:14] your honor through y you don't want hey
[11:58:17] you do not look look Navia already lost
[11:58:19] her dad child got [ __ ] clapped you I

[11:58:57] a human wow how utterly
[11:59:01] humiliating lady finina what is the
[11:59:04] meaning of
[11:59:06] this it would seem that there has been a
[11:59:10] misunderstanding to be clear the raising
[11:59:12] of both hands is not always an
[11:59:15] indication of surrender looking for
[11:59:18] excuses again huh I raised my hands just
[11:59:21] now to indicate my acceptance of the
[11:59:24] trial no duel shall be
[11:59:27] necessary I will admit that I've been
[11:59:30] running away for a long time I'm sorry

[12:01:07] greatest show sorry who will be my
[12:01:10] opponent in this trial the court asks

[12:02:06] chat is really cool when we do normal
[12:02:08] stuff whenever we do archon quests or
[12:02:09] Star rail where I can't talk as much you
[12:02:11] guys have a mind of your own and that
[12:02:13] never ends well whenever chat are left

[12:02:16] your hands I did they're literally still
[12:02:18] wet all right let's keep
[12:02:23] going
[12:02:26] [Music]
[12:02:32] also please allow me to ask as a final
[12:02:35] question before the trial
[12:02:37] begins just how much work did you do to
[12:02:41] force me onto this
[12:02:43] stage well we did do a lot of prep after
[12:02:46] the meeting that
[12:02:48] day I can go over the tasks assigned to
[12:02:50] the spad rosula since they were rather
[12:02:52] straightforward and easy Navia the
[12:02:55] president of the Spina rasula most of
[12:02:58] the people who participated in the
[12:02:59] disturbance this morning were my
[12:03:01] subordinates they changed into plain
[12:03:03] clothes and came to the opera house as
[12:03:05] regular audience members waiting for the
[12:03:08] oh so silver and were there too that's
[12:03:09] awesome Insurrection against you the
[12:03:12] people's resentment against their archon
[12:03:14] has been building as more and more of
[12:03:16] the prophecy is fulfilled a spark was
[12:03:18] all we needed to turn smoldering anger
[12:03:21] into a flame moreover according to
[12:03:25] understanding and Analysis of you when
[12:03:27] something like that occurred you would
[12:03:29] likely flee the scene and head to Pon by
[12:03:32] yourself so we arranged for a second
[12:03:35] group to lie in wait there so you mean
[12:03:39] the ones who scoured the settlement for
[12:03:42] me were also from the
[12:03:44] Spina and their goal was to force you to
[12:03:47] step into the giant magic box so you may
[12:03:50] personally participate in the greatest
[12:03:52] magic performance in all the f
[12:03:55] true that's right that house was a magic
[12:03:58] box rather than someone's residence as
[12:04:02] the super ultimate version of the setup
[12:04:04] that I used when I first performed at
[12:04:06] the Opera epic the volume of the box was
[12:04:09] increased by a whole order of magnitude
[12:04:12] and the distance it traversed was the
[12:04:14] entire gap between pant and aranas its
[12:04:17] cargo of course was an archon instead of
[12:04:21] a human my thanks forena without your
[12:04:25] help we could never have pulled off such
[12:04:27] an extraordinary
[12:04:29] performance uh you're welcome of course
[12:04:33] this performance was only made possible
[12:04:35] with Father's support the house of the
[12:04:38] heart spent a massive amount of Labor in
[12:04:40] Mora to pull this off we had to select a
[12:04:43] location construct the giant Magic Box
[12:04:45] dig a tunnel and open up a path through
[12:04:47] the water does this guy Electro one kind
[12:04:49] of look like me be honest be honest does
[12:04:51] it kind of look like me in other words
[12:04:54] the Earth Quake that we felt within the
[12:04:56] giant magic box was just a normal tremor
[12:05:00] from the transportation of the whole
[12:05:03] house that's right it wasn't a sign of
[12:05:06] another disaster to come sorry then I
[12:05:10] can guess nervet and koren's
[12:05:13] parts you gathered a crowd prepared a
[12:05:16] stage and made sure that the champion du
[12:05:19] would be imately ready for why are you
[12:05:22] wiping off your iron sting go make a
[12:05:24] better weapon look iron thing's fine if
[12:05:25] you're aggravating maybe hyper blo not
[12:05:27] really electr charge but realistically
[12:05:29] you're in this courtroom there's no
[12:05:30] dendro you're in font 10 I wouldn't
[12:05:31] recommend going iron thing it depends on
[12:05:33] what you scale off of but I would highly
[12:05:34] recommend a crit weapon you go like Miss
[12:05:36] spitter would kind of match you you go
[12:05:38] uh Jade cutter primordial Jade cutter
[12:05:40] like the primordial C hey that's a
[12:05:41] reference to primordial you could do
[12:05:43] that you could also go maybe uh I don't
[12:05:45] know maybe the low light of foler
[12:05:47] incision uh you could do if you want a
[12:05:49] force weapon black sword wolf Fang um if
[12:05:52] you buy the battle pass I don't know if
[12:05:53] you buy the battle pass if not like
[12:05:54] black Cliff uh iron think is okay if
[12:05:56] you're using four stars but you'd really
[12:05:58] have to make sure you're proing
[12:05:59] reactions uh if not again maybe like
[12:06:02] Lion's Roar for an electro character
[12:06:04] especially R5 could be not bad uh other
[12:06:06] five stars you sorry keep going also
[12:06:09] that as soon as I appeared on the stage
[12:06:12] the trial May commence without a hitch
[12:06:15] am I right yes that is
[12:06:19] correct well florand I must commend you
[12:06:23] for your courage
[12:06:25] only the most outstanding Champion
[12:06:27] duelist an Alla Fontaine would accept a
[12:06:30] duel with an archon without
[12:06:34] flinching thank you okay as for you
[12:06:38] traveler I suppose your role was to keep
[12:06:41] me distracted with conversation once you
[12:06:43] found me in Pon you'd make sure that I
[12:06:47] didn't notice anything am Miss before
[12:06:49] revealing yourself we kind of dropped
[12:06:50] the ball though once we' arrive she was
[12:06:53] kind of being honest with us she would
[12:06:54] told us everything I feel like and then
[12:06:55] we just did this we betrayed her no oh
[12:07:00] my mission was to give you one last
[12:07:03] chance we'd hope you CH oh well I guess
[12:07:07] yeah we hope you CH secet with us before
[12:07:09] the magic
[12:07:12] box I
[12:07:14] guess then I suppose I must have missed
[12:07:16] my no no we could we could have got it
[12:07:18] out of her give us like give us like
[12:07:20] another day we would had it it's fine it
[12:07:23] matters not what's done is done the
[12:07:26] stage is already set so there's no
[12:07:29] reason to disappoint the
[12:07:31] audience let's see this trial through to
[12:07:35] the very
[12:07:36] end yeah the only thing we can do now is
[12:07:39] Judge the hydro
[12:07:41] archon so how I feel a little bothered
[12:07:43] by the conversation earlier what did
[12:07:44] Freedom want to say right before we
[12:07:45] arrived Madam prosecutor please allow me
[12:07:48] to pass this along this is a charlot
[12:07:51] applied for
[12:07:52] and during the trial
[12:07:55] according to her it should speed up the
[12:07:57] proceedings huh Charlotte wanted to give
[12:08:00] us something oh so she's here too hey
[12:08:05] Charlotte okay oh let hman
[12:08:08] see uh isn't this the exclusive
[12:08:12] interview that wait then that means this
[12:08:15] document is a perfect timeline of
[12:08:17] everything that's happened ever since we
[12:08:19] steep foot in Fontaine so in other words
[12:08:21] we can refer to this anthology of
[12:08:24] evidence every time we want to use
[12:08:26] something from our journey is evidence
[12:08:27] for an argument super practical gift I
[12:08:31] just realized how long this Quest is
[12:08:32] going to be cuz I watched the trailer
[12:08:33] and we still haven't met [ __ ] skirk
[12:08:35] we haven't seen a whale which I fought
[12:08:37] for like 4 weeks now we haven't
[12:08:39] literally met like half the yo we
[12:08:41] haven't done [ __ ] it's a super practical
[12:08:43] gift let's quickly confirm the
[12:08:45] information in it just think of it as a
[12:08:47] refresher all
[12:08:49] right you defeated the hydro archon in
[12:08:52] the very first oh my God we're legit in
[12:08:54] house that's one for the history books
[12:08:57] all right okay I'm not going to use Chad
[12:08:58] for this I just finished donga 2 well
[12:09:00] I'm technically still in like the ending
[12:09:02] like trial but like basically done
[12:09:04] anyways I practice for this law student
[12:09:07] yeah but studying law doesn't they don't
[12:09:09] Chuck you in I
[12:09:11] mean I don't know become Len's attorney
[12:09:15] yeah we did become L's attorney I didn't
[12:09:16] think that you'd wind up getting to the
[12:09:17] bottom of the case I'd been following
[12:09:19] all this time this is the first time
[12:09:21] Miss nerby Roso child
[12:09:25] orri
[12:09:27] AR I read that as the meeting with Kanye
[12:09:30] I'm what the [ __ ] the meeting with the
[12:09:31] Nave tuy Harbinger she's an
[12:09:34] extraordinary person her Instinct must
[12:09:36] mean
[12:09:39] something The Fortress of mpede was
[12:09:41] almost destroyed in a single day that I
[12:09:45] didn't witness that scene personally
[12:09:47] will always be a source of professional
[12:09:49] regret I
[12:09:50] think according to miss nit both child
[12:09:54] and and that whale should have been in
[12:09:55] the primordial sea at that time I nearly
[12:09:57] lost my awesome friend Navia to be
[12:10:00] honest that still gives me
[12:10:02] shivers the words of someone as
[12:10:04] extraordinary as a witch can probably
[12:10:06] only be truly understood when something
[12:10:09] surreal happens to
[12:10:15] you the prosecution and the defense how
[12:10:17] do she know all of this if you were
[12:10:19] listening sorry we told her it was an
[12:10:21] interview we told her Charlotte was like
[12:10:23] hey and then we we
[12:10:26] Sorry come on nervet there's no need to
[12:10:31] repeat all the unimportant legal leads
[12:10:34] just fast forward to the part where the
[12:10:36] prosecution lays out my offenses as the
[12:10:39] defendant and the lead actress of this
[12:10:42] performance I still haven't even why my
[12:10:46] supposed guilt in all of this of course
[12:10:50] it is only natural for humans to
[12:10:52] struggle to understand the the actions
[12:10:55] of a god however you will need more than
[12:10:58] that to convict me of a crime Bro [ __ ]
[12:11:02] it worst case I don't know the lore yet
[12:11:04] okay we'll see at the end of the quest
[12:11:05] worst case Ser just be like listen up
[12:11:07] okay I'mma Be Real I've been lying this
[12:11:08] whole time I can't do [ __ ] prophecy is
[12:11:10] going to kill us all we're all dead in
[12:11:12] like [ __ ] a week so for now just
[12:11:14] [ __ ] have fun I don't know spend your
[12:11:16] money do whatever you got to do boom
[12:11:17] that's it at least we'll have a last
[12:11:19] [ __ ] fun week in font 10 it is what
[12:11:21] it is [ __ ] it sorry I don't know let's
[12:11:23] keep playing
[12:11:24] but my charge here is unrelated to your
[12:11:26] conduct as an archon the [ __ ] me talks
[12:11:29] dead I would like to charge you as a
[12:11:31] fraud who's never been the Arun in the
[12:11:33] first place wait what was that lady
[12:11:37] fen's a
[12:11:39] fraud hey I came here thinking that we
[12:11:42] were going to try the hydro archon for
[12:11:44] forsaking her yo did I hear that right
[12:11:48] she's not our archon at all charge
[12:11:53] accepted
[12:11:55] lady finina do you plead guilty to the
[12:12:01] charge lady finina I plead not guilty
[12:12:06] how can I be guilty there is no way that
[12:12:10] I otherwise known as finina
[12:12:14] Deon seven and the Regina of all Waters
[12:12:17] kindreds and laws of Fontaine could be
[12:12:20] anything other than your true AR yeah
[12:12:25] even though lady finina can be rather
[12:12:27] eccentric isn't it going too far to
[12:12:29] doubt her very identity it's true yeah
[12:12:32] I've never questioned her identity
[12:12:33] either sure lady finina can be super
[12:12:37] irresponsible but but what grounds does
[12:12:40] that prosecutor have to make such a huge
[12:12:43] claim I have cause to believe that
[12:12:46] Common Sense will prevail in this case
[12:12:50] many of the members of the audience have
[12:12:51] known me as the hydro Aron ever since
[12:12:54] they were born there would be no fooling
[12:12:57] their memory see even the orries has
[12:13:02] decided to show me its favor are you
[12:13:05] sure you want to commit to a charge that
[12:13:07] will never be
[12:13:09] upheld if you wish to drop the case I
[12:13:12] can promise you as the God of Justice
[12:13:16] that you will not have to face trial for
[12:13:18] making a false accusation we will treat
[12:13:21] everything that's happened as a dramatic
[12:13:24] spectacle and move on with our lives
[12:13:27] what do you say to that huh an argument
[12:13:31] with near impossible odds huh we have to
[12:13:34] not only refute fen's claims but also
[12:13:37] overturn the long held beliefs of the
[12:13:39] people the people only see as their
[12:13:41] archon because that's their long held
[12:13:42] belief yeah I don't know if you want to
[12:13:44] go against that I'm going to be real
[12:13:46] well I tried to give you the chance to
[12:13:49] surrender if you must persist then let
[12:13:52] me ask if you believe I'm not the archon
[12:13:57] then what manner of being do you think I
[12:13:59] am finina as the kid grew up playing get
[12:14:02] your impact she saw kokomi on TV she saw
[12:14:04] what Ki could do she was a Ki man she
[12:14:06] was like oh my God kookomi can walk on
[12:14:07] water she's literally a mermaid I want
[12:14:09] to be like her when I grew up and tried
[12:14:10] to make it right that's why her hair
[12:14:11] looks like a jellyfish okay so that's
[12:14:13] what she was trying to do it's kind of
[12:14:14] like how Wanderer is like H I'm Wanderer
[12:14:17] I want to main Shia like wander is a sh
[12:14:19] M we know this right you look at sh okay
[12:14:21] look look at wander right look at all
[12:14:23] his back story he would main Shia if he
[12:14:25] played genjin if wner played genjin and
[12:14:27] wasn't in the game he would main Shia so
[12:14:29] he tried to like listen it just it's it
[12:14:31] is what it is wander would me Shia
[12:14:33] Farina would mean Ki let's just keep
[12:14:34] playing and if I was not the archon then
[12:14:39] how did I managed to live for over 500
[12:14:44] years we got to think carefully what do
[12:14:46] we know to be special about Fina exactly
[12:14:49] um she likes
[12:14:51] cake uh she likes I mean she's a good
[12:14:55] actress um she's cute don't forget that
[12:15:00] um she's
[12:15:04] fun
[12:15:09] um wait what is special about finina yo
[12:15:13] none of these are about finina uh okay
[12:15:16] Lenny's attorney fontans can be
[12:15:19] dissolved by water sure child's
[12:15:22] conviction that's the [ __ ]
[12:15:25] mean what is this the meaning oh I mean
[12:15:27] I guess this is about finina the name
[12:15:28] she revealed that she had treat that she
[12:15:30] had already probed for probed the [ __ ]
[12:15:33] does that mean finina on her own I'm
[12:15:36] going to look up probe right now
[12:15:38] probe from Starcraft a blunt ended
[12:15:41] surgical instrument used for exploring a
[12:15:43] wound or part of the
[12:15:45] body physically explore
[12:15:47] or oh yeah when she met her I remember
[12:15:50] okay I remember I remember when the cut
[12:15:52] scene she was like a you don't have a a
[12:15:54] [ __ ] what is it called neosis no yeah
[12:15:57] neosis my bad on her own and believes
[12:15:59] that possibly not only is finina not
[12:16:01] really the AR okay it's this
[12:16:03] right wait no but it's why can't she
[12:16:06] live so long Afflicted with some kind of
[12:16:08] curse yeah it might be the curse what
[12:16:10] about this uh I'm just going to click
[12:16:12] this it has to be this yeah can't be
[12:16:15] anything else first of all you may be a
[12:16:18] member of another long lived race which
[12:16:21] would allow you to naturally possess a
[12:16:24] meline no sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry even
[12:16:27] if that wasn't the case there could be
[12:16:30] other ways to extend your
[12:16:35] life okay sorry I was 3 seconds L okay
[12:16:38] such as a
[12:16:39] curse who gave you that idea was it the
[12:16:43] name you speak so low as to use a
[12:16:46] harbinger's words against me doesn't
[12:16:49] matter who give us the information what
[12:16:50] matters is the veracity of the claim
[12:16:53] curse
[12:16:54] a cur I once thought it possible that
[12:16:55] the AA of Aron might naturally resemble
[12:16:58] the type of curse but in light of this
[12:17:00] claim perhaps what I sensed was not your
[12:17:03] Divinity but a curse after all you
[12:17:06] sensed it too oh like in Spider-Man
[12:17:08] across the spiderverse there's like spot
[12:17:10] right who's like he was supposed to be
[12:17:12] the the the Spider-Man dude but like he
[12:17:13] didn't cuz the other dude got bit by
[12:17:15] like the spider like he yed him so he
[12:17:16] became the spot yo sa finina instead of
[12:17:19] an archon could you just be a cursed
[12:17:21] human lady finina
[12:17:24] is actually a human well it is true that
[12:17:28] it's extremely difficult to tell humans
[12:17:30] and gods apart just by looking at them
[12:17:32] it's not impossible that's wrong Li I'm
[12:17:35] not here to debate Marvel or I don't
[12:17:37] know okay I'm sorry I'm sorry well don't
[12:17:41] start celebrating too early now even if
[12:17:44] I have been carrying a curse like you
[12:17:46] said how does that prove that I am
[12:17:49] merely a human being besides every
[12:17:53] everyone knows that the main difference
[12:17:55] between a human and a God is the
[12:17:57] possession of authority Gods can do what
[12:17:59] humans cannot that's why they're
[12:18:01] worshiped as gods for centuries
[12:18:05] manifestations of my authority have
[12:18:07] served the nation of
[12:18:09] Fontaine one need only to turn their
[12:18:12] eyes towards the orrice mechanique de an
[12:18:14] cardal in oper house or consider the
[12:18:18] endium that is used in every aspect of
[12:18:21] life okay my bad that was spoilers it's
[12:18:23] literally the first 5 minutes of the
[12:18:25] movie I watch chat literally the first 5
[12:18:26] minutes anyways I'm no more immersion
[12:18:28] breaking okay we're going to keep
[12:18:31] going wait that one trial proved the
[12:18:33] opposite fre actually has no control
[12:18:35] over the AR at all yep that's the child
[12:18:39] one I told you I'm cored to reference
[12:18:42] the
[12:18:42] orrice I told you as confused as all the
[12:18:46] rest of us when the orrice declared
[12:18:47] child to be guilty without any proof
[12:18:50] otherwise you should have come up with a
[12:18:52] good explanation for that by now didn't
[12:18:55] I make myself clear at the time the
[12:18:57] decisions of the gods are naturally
[12:19:00] difficult for humans to comprehend there
[12:19:02] is no need to provide an
[12:19:06] explanation lady finina I believe a
[12:19:08] reminder of your current circumstances
[12:19:11] is in order while the court is in
[12:19:13] session the principles of justice and
[12:19:15] the law must come before all else while
[12:19:19] you are an archon you are also first and
[12:19:21] foremost the defendant in this trial you
[12:19:24] will prove yourself unable to defend
[12:19:26] against the prosecution's charges if you
[12:19:29] continue to withhold Vital Information
[12:19:31] against the rules of the
[12:19:33] court I never thought you'd use that
[12:19:36] kind of rhetoric against me that was no
[12:19:39] trick of rhetoric lady finina I've
[12:19:42] merely reiterated the rules of the court
[12:19:44] rules that all should respect and
[12:19:49] follow so you neither knew why child was
[12:19:52] declared guilty nor did you understand
[12:19:55] the structure and operations of the
[12:19:58] orri instead of having been created by
[12:20:01] you the manifestations of authority you
[12:20:04] mentioned have been made by the real
[12:20:06] Hydro archine haven't they the real
[12:20:09] Hydro archon well now you're really
[12:20:12] losing me it is true that I did not know
[12:20:15] why the orrice gave out a guilty verdict
[12:20:18] that day but the orries handed out that
[12:20:21] verdict unilaterally
[12:20:23] and it has been operating independently
[12:20:26] ever since it was first created wait
[12:20:29] you're tell me that in 500 years no one
[12:20:31] called outout I don't know we'll see but
[12:20:32] I feel you can't you can't argue that
[12:20:36] just because a Divine creation is flawed
[12:20:39] that the god behind it must also be no
[12:20:41] God at
[12:20:43] all she's still throwing out all kinds
[12:20:45] of excuses meanwhile in mon that they
[12:20:48] just don't believe V be able to produce
[12:20:50] proof that she has no power just
[12:20:51] drinking wine
[12:20:54] sure we can put the orries aside for now
[12:20:56] but then miss Reena could you give us a
[12:20:57] brief demonstration of your powers in
[12:20:59] Aron my power as an
[12:21:03] archon there are many ordinary citizens
[12:21:06] in the audience how can I just
[12:21:08] carelessly demonstrate the formidable
[12:21:10] power of an
[12:21:12] archon if that poses a concern I'm
[12:21:15] prepared to extend my protection to the
[12:21:17] audience
[12:21:19] um you don't need to go that far
[12:21:26] a brief desion of your power over Hydro
[12:21:28] should be quite harmless surely an
[12:21:30] archon can at least match the compat
[12:21:31] human of the vision I was literally
[12:21:32] about to say that like literally we play
[12:21:34] as her right now she has a vision can't
[12:21:36] she just press e summon [ __ ] mm and
[12:21:39] then just I don't know we'll see bro
[12:21:41] literally press your skill E I did it I
[12:21:43] just did it aren't you the hydro Aran or
[12:21:47] is it that you can't even wield the
[12:21:48] power of hydro much less the authority
[12:21:51] of a God in IND demium yes it's all
[12:21:55] because of indem nium all archons derive
[12:21:59] their power from the faith of the people
[12:22:01] and I've converted the people's faith in
[12:22:04] Justice into indem nium thus did I give
[12:22:08] up all of my divine power to provide
[12:22:10] everyone with energy for their daily
[12:22:13] lives have you ever seen a more
[12:22:16] magnanimous God
[12:22:18] magnanimous isn't that a huge stretch
[12:22:22] yeah no matter how generous an arhun can
[12:22:24] be how could they give up all their
[12:22:26] power can a god with no power even still
[12:22:28] be called a god
[12:22:31] hey don't talk about finina like that it
[12:22:34] seems like nobody's buying fina's excuse
[12:22:37] hey come now everyone please don't stare
[12:22:41] at me as if I was a liar I'm still the
[12:22:44] same finina you knew right
[12:22:47] Mar I don't hey I don't care who you are
[12:22:50] don't talk about finina like that good
[12:22:52] voice acting though sorry I'm still the
[12:22:55] same fre right the one that you loved
[12:22:57] shouldn't you want to believe in
[12:23:01] me please you've got to believe me if
[12:23:06] what the prosecutor said is true she
[12:23:08] really has committed a grave offense did
[12:23:11] she all of us and all of our parents and
[12:23:14] grandparents too and all of our
[12:23:17] ancestors ever since they were born yo
[12:23:20] who asked you enough that's enough
[12:23:23] enough tell me then if I'm not the real
[12:23:29] Hydro who is if you have noid another
[12:23:34] Hydro archon existence nor can you find
[12:23:37] anyone who I said claim to be such then
[12:23:41] what ground have you to say that I'm not
[12:23:44] actually the real
[12:23:45] deal wow she came up with yet another
[12:23:49] argument how can we repute her now seems
[12:23:53] like she really doesn't want to give
[12:23:56] up
[12:23:58] October October 19th uh I said I called
[12:24:01] kakomi the true Hydro archon there's
[12:24:03] probably evidence of earlier but that's
[12:24:04] just the in case you want
[12:24:08] some I can't Pro that she's an archon we
[12:24:10] can try to prove that she's just a human
[12:24:12] and if she's only
[12:24:13] human um then she wouldn't
[12:24:17] [Music]
[12:24:20] know
[12:24:21] um
[12:24:24] performance at grand opera house they're
[12:24:26] cleared of the accusations leveled
[12:24:27] against
[12:24:31] them I mean I was thinking
[12:24:39] that what evidence can prove that fre is
[12:24:42] human well the fact that nevet had to do
[12:24:44] this but I don't think that's it uh
[12:24:46] nevet fell into seawater but I don't
[12:24:48] think that is relevant but game L's
[12:24:51] attorney
[12:24:53] clear accus are revealed F can be
[12:24:56] dissolved water from the primordial sea
[12:24:58] over the years vashi kidnapped and
[12:25:00] dissolved many young girls for his
[12:25:01] experiments to try Okay
[12:25:05] uh might be this but I don't know how
[12:25:08] that low
[12:25:10] key I mean if it's up to me I I use this
[12:25:13] what we learned about [ __ ] arino I
[12:25:15] don't know how the other ones relate to
[12:25:16] her this it can't be this
[12:25:19] one it could be this
[12:25:21] one it can't be
[12:25:24] that maybe
[12:25:30] why cuz she's not stopping people from
[12:25:32] getting dissolved maybe I guess [ __ ]
[12:25:38] it it has been that all fontans can
[12:25:43] dissolve from the primordial sea and
[12:25:46] that
[12:25:47] means since you insist on claiming to be
[12:25:50] a God and not a human then there's a a
[12:25:53] method that you can use right here and
[12:25:55] now to eliminate all suspicions of you
[12:25:57] being the latter Miss Navia please apply
[12:26:01] to serve as a temporary attorney for the
[12:26:02] prosecution before addressing the court
[12:26:05] though you act in partnership with the
[12:26:07] prosecutor you must still adhere to
[12:26:09] proper
[12:26:11] procedure super Sorry Miss chief justice
[12:26:14] I swear this really will be the last
[12:26:16] time that I'll speak out of turn now
[12:26:20] I've brought some sea water from Pon as
[12:26:22] every everyone knows a massive blood
[12:26:24] struck the area not long ago taking many
[12:26:27] lives including those of some of my
[12:26:30] closest friends s so miss finina would
[12:26:34] you dare to touch some of the sea water
[12:26:37] I'll drink it we are to believe that you
[12:26:38] are indeed the real Hydro archon
[12:26:41] touching the seawat would have no effect
[12:26:43] on you all it should do is strengthen
[12:26:45] your case but if you don't dare to touch
[12:26:48] it then we would have basically proved
[12:26:50] the
[12:26:51] reverse
[12:26:53] oh and I must remind you that after the
[12:26:55] disaster at Pon nobody wants to see any
[12:26:58] more people dissolve I do wait why is it
[12:27:01] like open Arrow simp what if you you
[12:27:04] literally trip what if it falls and it
[12:27:06] just kills someone from
[12:27:08] the thepa has governed Pon for many
[12:27:11] years I guess her suggestion is
[12:27:14] valid if lady finina is indeed just a
[12:27:17] human she's probably fanian like all the
[12:27:20] rest of us would she really dare to try
[12:27:25] [Music]
[12:27:29] my client finina while she is an archon
[12:27:32] and not just a mere human can't actually
[12:27:34] touch the water because archons their
[12:27:35] physical form could still dissolve and
[12:27:37] finina because she's so humble and wants
[12:27:39] to be loved by the people she chose to
[12:27:42] be one with the people instead of being
[12:27:43] condescending and and looking down upon
[12:27:46] you she said no I want to be have a
[12:27:48] human form that would dissolve like
[12:27:50] yours sorry uh for
[12:27:53] lady finina this test has been
[12:27:55] unilaterally proposed by the prosecution
[12:27:58] as it falls outside the realm of
[12:27:59] standard Court proceedings you possess
[12:28:02] the right to decline
[12:28:08] participation what if she chucks at
[12:28:10] someone well of course he had to tell
[12:28:12] her that but refusing to participate is
[12:28:14] basically the same as a confession of
[12:28:17] guilt she's just staring at the water
[12:28:19] without saying a single word it really
[12:28:22] does seem like she's quite terrified of
[12:28:24] it that could only mean what's going on
[12:28:29] is she really planning
[12:28:32] to that's not what we thought she would
[12:28:35] well I thought we'd be bluffing it
[12:28:36] should be fake water why is it real due
[12:28:38] to the inherent risk of the test lady
[12:28:40] finina you
[12:28:44] may what wait that was her right hand
[12:28:47] too bro use your left one the
[12:28:51] [ __ ]
[12:28:58] I I'm fine look look at me everyone my
[12:29:03] hand is still here I haven't been
[12:29:06] dissolved she's left-handed oh believe
[12:29:09] me now I really am your archon I'm
[12:29:13] nothing like a normal human who would
[12:29:15] fall apart as soon as they touch this
[12:29:17] water true really was this not the most
[12:29:20] obvious thing in the world Miss sien if
[12:29:24] you present Miss sien please come
[12:29:25] forward and attend to the defendant
[12:29:30] SI wait why is she here don't be nervous
[12:29:34] it'll just take a few
[12:29:37] seconds let me
[12:29:38] [Music]
[12:29:41] see that should be enough please
[12:29:44] announce the results of your evaluation
[12:29:46] to the court Miss seen as everyone
[12:29:49] doubtlessly saw Miss Farina was
[12:29:51] displaying symptoms of hyperventilation
[12:29:54] and flushed skin flushed these indicate
[12:29:57] that she was experiencing the adverse
[12:30:00] effects of exposure to primordial seawat
[12:30:03] the extent to which she was affected is
[12:30:06] the same as other humans when exposed to
[12:30:08] primordial sea water of a similar you
[12:30:10] know what I don't really like you right
[12:30:12] now first you shoot Linny then you like
[12:30:14] [ __ ] like manip you literally like
[12:30:16] baited us and Lynette then that's two
[12:30:19] then you also are going against Serena
[12:30:22] now
[12:30:22] you know what [ __ ] you sorry thank you
[12:30:25] Miss seen lady finina you may return to
[12:30:28] the defendant's stand oh wait what did
[12:30:31] she just say I didn't get dissolved
[12:30:34] shouldn't that be enough to prove my
[12:30:36] innocence she's just a meline so is
[12:30:38] sadine and sedin's
[12:30:40] goated well considering your tendency to
[12:30:43] run from your problems we did originally
[12:30:46] prepare a direct sample of the seawater
[12:30:48] around Pon however after extensive
[12:30:51] discussion we exchanged it for a sample
[12:30:53] that is not concentrated enough to
[12:30:55] dissolve an actual Human After All on
[12:30:58] the off chance that something entirely
[12:31:01] unexpected might occur we don't want
[12:31:05] anyone else to lose their life to the
[12:31:07] Sea yeah so out of regard for fina's
[12:31:10] life you s ohed a low concentration
[12:31:14] sample and asked the head nurse to serve
[12:31:16] as an expert witness it's a great thing
[12:31:19] that the direct sample wasn't actually
[12:31:20] used finina could have
[12:31:24] I I can't believe
[12:31:28] you it's really going on here F could
[12:31:30] not known the conse can have not known
[12:31:33] the consequences of touching it as a
[12:31:34] human this is too unlike how she usually
[12:31:36] acts unless it's actually more important
[12:31:37] for her to keep her upper facade than to
[12:31:38] save her own life yes it is I don't know
[12:31:40] why you just realized this now traveler
[12:31:41] she cares more about the ACT even if she
[12:31:43] lost her
[12:31:45] hand listen to me listen to me everyone
[12:31:49] please don't give me such cold and
[12:31:51] disain F looks what happened just now
[12:31:54] didn't prove a single
[12:31:56] thing think about it how can you
[12:31:59] conclusively prove that an archon can't
[12:32:02] also be affected by the primordial
[12:32:05] seawater also also if I was really just
[12:32:09] a human why would I dare to just put my
[12:32:11] hand in that kind of
[12:32:20] water please everyone anyone just listen
[12:32:24] to me I swear I really am your
[12:32:30] Aron
[12:32:41] S I don't think anything she says at
[12:32:44] this point will sway anyone the odds are
[12:32:46] just too stacked against her now with
[12:32:48] all the things that have been said pman
[12:32:50] doesn't think there's any way left for
[12:32:52] for finina to win I believe the time for
[12:32:54] arguments and presentation of evidence
[12:32:56] has come to an end if there are no
[12:32:58] objections we will move on to the final
[12:33:08] judgment I don't think anything she says
[12:33:11] at this point will s too Ste against her
[12:33:21] now
[12:33:26] in my capacity as chief justice I shall
[12:33:29] now render judgment on farina's
[12:33:31] misrepresentation of herself as the
[12:33:32] archon of Fontaine as a human who
[12:33:35] knowingly deceived her fellow citizens
[12:33:38] finina
[12:33:42] is
[12:33:51] guilty
[12:33:58] we shall now turn to the orrice mechan
[12:34:00] Jal ctin to render the final verdict on
[12:34:02] the
[12:34:09] charges the [ __ ] that was a
[12:34:14] star
[12:34:18] gotcha according to the Judgment of the
[12:34:20] orrice mechan J Alise Cardinal finina
[12:34:27] is well what's wrong what's the orrice
[12:34:31] verdict no the orrice also displays a
[12:34:34] guilty verdict isn't that correct
[12:34:37] then however the exact wording of the
[12:34:41] verdict is
[12:34:42] thus the hydro Aron guilty to be
[12:34:46] punished via the death
[12:34:51] sentence
[12:34:53] Y what wait this is actually France
[12:34:57] sentences I've always thought that he
[12:34:59] was just a myth the one and only time
[12:35:02] the death sentence has been handed out
[12:35:03] at the court and it's been given to the
[12:35:06] very person we've worshiped as the God
[12:35:07] of Justice Fen has been sentenced to
[12:35:11] death by the
[12:35:12] orries we just wanted to use the trail
[12:35:14] to show her the seriousness of things so
[12:35:16] she tell us the truth how did things
[12:35:19] escalate this quickly
[12:35:22] this outcome is indeed quite strange
[12:35:25] according to fontaine's current
[12:35:26] definitions of justice as well as its
[12:35:28] recommendations for criminal sentences
[12:35:31] is this sentence really appropriate for
[12:35:33] the crimes that have been committed s
[12:35:36] yeah even wasn't sentenced to death by
[12:35:39] the
[12:35:40] orri fil Mastermind behind the serial
[12:35:42] disappearances case smart strange is
[12:35:44] instead of free now the Oris rendered
[12:35:46] the judgment on the hydro archon yeah
[12:35:48] they're talking about the last Hydro
[12:35:49] archon wait now we have to prove that
[12:35:51] didn't we just just proved she's not the
[12:35:52] Hydra archon so doesn't that mean the
[12:35:54] other one has to die indeed the [ __ ] did
[12:35:57] the last one do sentence over excessive
[12:36:00] the very point of our trial today was
[12:36:02] also to prove that finina has never been
[12:36:04] the hydro archon in the first place well
[12:36:06] I'm cooking but now the AA tree seems to
[12:36:09] have deliberately invoked the title of
[12:36:10] the hydro archon what does this mean
[12:36:14] wait your honor this judgment has to be
[12:36:16] false how because the whole premise was
[12:36:18] she's guilty of not being the hydro
[12:36:19] archon but then the the Judgment said
[12:36:21] the hydro archon die so it can't be my
[12:36:23] client it can't be finina finina doesn't
[12:36:25] die if Fin's the Hydra archon then she
[12:36:28] wouldn't be
[12:36:30] guilty um excuse me if I may interrupt
[12:36:35] REM this is your last
[12:36:37] chance sorry we love F the trial still
[12:36:40] going yes it is fem you finally made it
[12:36:45] I assume this means you've completed
[12:36:46] your mission mhm any Mission father
[12:36:50] assigns to me will always always be top
[12:36:52] priority okay
[12:36:54] based with some help from the other foui
[12:36:56] fmin brings a stone slate oh that's the
[12:36:59] one we were missing the first prophecy
[12:37:02] slate who the [ __ ] is
[12:37:05] that huh so the name privately arranged
[12:37:08] for fade to try and find the missing
[12:37:11] slate I do you f everywhere and finally
[12:37:14] found it at the bottom of the sea it
[12:37:17] took me a long time to get around some
[12:37:19] dangerous stretches of water he fin he
[12:37:21] cooked hey he cooked I doubted him at
[12:37:24] first I can't lie but he cooked already
[12:37:26] concluded then doesn't that mean I've
[12:37:29] come too
[12:37:31] late oh no father will be disappointed
[12:37:35] in me S don't worry the mystery hasn't
[12:37:37] been resolved yet it's not too late for
[12:37:39] you to
[12:37:40] shine thank you for your hard work Mr
[12:37:43] fem please allow me to review the record
[12:37:45] left on the
[12:37:49] Slate traveler I believe that you have
[12:37:51] already already seen the other existing
[12:37:53] slates would like you to come here and
[12:37:55] confirm their
[12:37:58] contents it looked like a satue of this
[12:38:00] seven but I don't know who the dude in
[12:38:01] the middle was so what do you see what
[12:38:04] this looks like the previous hyaron
[12:38:07] releasing her divine power turning the
[12:38:08] oceanids into humans
[12:38:12] [Music]
[12:38:13] oh I believe I have now made sense of
[12:38:16] the hydro archon's crime it has to do
[12:38:19] with fontaine's lost history
[12:38:23] watch let me predict it are you ready
[12:38:24] Hydro Aron just deceiving her people oh
[12:38:28] wait no that's finina and we've already
[12:38:30] proven that she's not the hydro
[12:38:33] archan uh so when you say Hydro archon
[12:38:36] do you mean the real Hydro AR we've been
[12:38:38] kind of talking about in truth
[12:38:41] everything that you've encountered in
[12:38:42] Fontaine up until this point can be
[12:38:44] traced back to the contents of these
[12:38:46] Stone slates however I'm uncertain as to
[12:38:49] how much sense they currently make to
[12:38:51] you
[12:38:52] association between the contents of the
[12:38:53] slates and events in real life let's try
[12:38:55] to recall the contents of the other
[12:38:59] three I remember what they
[12:39:02] were what the [ __ ] is
[12:39:14] this the first stone slate describes
[12:39:17] what you just have we done this before I
[12:39:18] don't remember it seems to show the
[12:39:20] previous Hydro Aron using her divine
[12:39:22] power and then the oids turn into humans
[12:39:26] it's going to be like oh my God the
[12:39:28] previous Hydra archon their heart was so
[12:39:29] big their whole people got turned into
[12:39:31] oceanides so she committed or they I
[12:39:33] don't know they they committed a
[12:39:34] cardinal sin of turning them back to
[12:39:36] humans and then they curse the next
[12:39:38] hydro archon which is finina watch and
[12:39:40] then it's like oh my God okay sorry the
[12:39:42] real uh does that mean that fontans are
[12:39:45] transformed
[12:39:46] oen oh P wasn't expecting that but can
[12:39:52] turn into humans then perhaps this
[12:39:55] process can be reversed as well the
[12:39:57] second Stone slate shows Celestia
[12:39:59] floating in the sky and the Hydra Aran
[12:40:01] and her people worshiping it together
[12:40:04] but the heavens this must be the point
[12:40:07] when the hydro Aran and the fontans were
[12:40:09] branded with their original sin does
[12:40:12] this mean that the original sin and the
[12:40:15] hydro archon sin are the same thing the
[12:40:18] third slate shows the hydro archon
[12:40:20] seeking into the SE surrounded by many
[12:40:23] people that reminds Pon didn't we also
[12:40:26] watch that happen to someone else
[12:40:29] Navia am I dumb didn't Navia
[12:40:32] s well the for slate is the prophecy the
[12:40:35] fontans have been talking about people
[12:40:38] dissolving into the sea the Hydra archon
[12:40:41] crying on her throne and so on we didn't
[12:40:44] believe that such a crazy disaster could
[12:40:46] happen at first did
[12:40:50] we
[12:40:52] I have to verify the truths the real
[12:40:54] event related to prophecies the stone
[12:40:56] slates in the ruin describe a history of
[12:40:58] the
[12:41:00] future this is the first piece it seems
[12:41:03] to show the former Hydro archon using
[12:41:04] divine power to turn oceanids into
[12:41:06] people verify truth oh my food's outside
[12:41:10] I got poutine it's going to get cold I
[12:41:12] don't need to eat it now but I don't
[12:41:13] want it to be cold in the Canadian
[12:41:14] winter let me get it and then we'll
[12:41:16] finish this after this short
[12:41:20] break
[12:41:22] yo Chad I don't know if I'm going to eat
[12:41:24] right now but let me show you everything
[12:41:25] I got bro I got actually valued dude
[12:41:28] whoever brought it they put it right in
[12:41:29] front of my door so I literally couldn't
[12:41:31] open the door and if I did it would like
[12:41:32] fall everything over I hate when they so
[12:41:34] literally I had to in order to open it
[12:41:35] it was like here right door is here the
[12:41:37] P food package was here I had to
[12:41:38] literally get submissive and breedable
[12:41:40] on my knees to like open the door
[12:41:42] slightly and like reach my hand across
[12:41:44] to literally bring it in it was [ __ ]
[12:41:45] anyways so this was like 20 Canadian
[12:41:48] which honestly isn't that bad or like 19
[12:41:50] canadi isn't that bad for the amount of
[12:41:52] food I got so we got look it came with a
[12:41:54] bunch of like chicken tenders with sauce
[12:41:55] right okay not bad not bad we take those
[12:41:58] okay and then that's not all that's only
[12:41:59] half that's only one thing okay and then
[12:42:01] a [ __ ] poutine shees can you guys see
[12:42:04] it it kind of looks disgusting but it's
[12:42:06] good I promise it's actually cracked I
[12:42:08] just can't eat it I don't eat it
[12:42:10] normally cuz it makes me feel gross but
[12:42:12] it but unless I'm like hung over but oh
[12:42:14] I just spilled the water my oh no did I
[12:42:15] just do my mouse pad wait one sec I'm
[12:42:17] going to pour water in my mouse
[12:42:19] pad let me cook chat
[12:42:24] balding I am I'm not balding wait
[12:42:27] there's water on the ground what the
[12:42:28] [ __ ] wait was something leak did I leak
[12:42:30] something how the [ __ ] did I leak
[12:42:31] something okay let me wash my hands the
[12:42:34] moisture of the bag okay I'm
[12:42:38] here okay it seems to show the former
[12:42:40] Hydro Aron using divine power to turn
[12:42:42] oceanids into
[12:42:46] people we know from The Case of the
[12:42:48] serial disappearances of young women
[12:42:50] thought fon Ians can be dissolved in
[12:42:52] primordial seawater and the first stone
[12:42:55] slate tells us that long ago the hyro
[12:42:58] used her power to turn oits into humans
[12:43:01] this might be the reason that fontans
[12:43:03] can
[12:43:06] dissolve easy for
[12:43:08] Z Celestia floating in the sky and
[12:43:10] woring the hydro Aron or people woring
[12:43:12] it together and hydar people woring it
[12:43:13] together they hav still brought judgment
[12:43:15] down upon
[12:43:18] them might be
[12:43:20] this
[12:43:29] it might also be this I'm going to skip
[12:43:31] this one uh it shows the hydro gon
[12:43:33] singing into the sea by many
[12:43:38] people it's not as simple as falling
[12:43:41] into the sea when Navia fell into the
[12:43:43] sea her Consciousness was subjected to
[12:43:45] judgment the stone slates show the
[12:43:48] people gathered around the hydro archon
[12:43:50] in the sea
[12:43:52] could that be alluding to the same
[12:43:57] thing basically identical to that
[12:43:59] described in the prophecy containing
[12:44:01] circulating throughout Fontan F will
[12:44:02] eventually be dissolved into the sea and
[12:44:04] the hydron will sit alone on her throne
[12:44:06] and weep
[12:44:13] sag what does no I knew it it was this
[12:44:16] one cuz the the waters would kill
[12:44:18] everyone D I just thought that girl was
[12:44:19] relevant she's not [ __ ] the [ __ ]
[12:44:21] not many people believed it I'm EA
[12:44:24] mying nearly flooded with primordial sea
[12:44:28] which we know can cause Fontane to
[12:44:30] dissolve it seems increasingly likely
[12:44:33] that the prophecy may come true if we
[12:44:35] hadn't dealt with it in time things
[12:44:37] could have gone very
[12:44:46] badly perhaps what is about to take
[12:44:48] place hased before the TR sin of the
[12:44:51] hydro archon that nervet mentioned and
[12:44:53] the original sin cast down on the people
[12:44:55] of Fontaine by Celestia as recorded on
[12:44:58] the stone
[12:45:02] slate they'll dissolve into the
[12:45:04] primordial sea but won't cease to exist
[12:45:07] their Essence will flow in the seawater
[12:45:11] converge and take the form of an
[12:45:15] oid the hydro archan was sensit to death
[12:45:18] in court shocking everyone present H
[12:45:23] perhaps this means that her sin was
[12:45:26] actually fontaine's original
[12:45:29] sin eating meals for an 8-year-old bro
[12:45:33] it's 3:00 a.m. everything's closed
[12:45:35] except poutine and McDonald's I chose
[12:45:37] poutine that's literally everything else
[12:45:39] is closed
[12:45:41] here Navia fell into the water inside
[12:45:44] those ruins and she nearly dissolved she
[12:45:47] was surrounded by I'm not going to cook
[12:45:49] at 3 a.m. within her Consciousness and
[12:45:52] was forced to take part in a trial meant
[12:45:54] to make Chris Day
[12:45:56] true the eruption of the primordial SE
[12:45:59] at The Fortress of meped was the shest
[12:46:01] sign that the prophecy was about to come
[12:46:03] to pass no matter
[12:46:06] what the prophecy's contents can all be
[12:46:09] verified by recent events if we combine
[12:46:12] what we know together loads of Truth
[12:46:14] should come to light
[12:46:19] true
[12:46:27] hello hello
[12:46:31] game oh it's a cut scene I'll shut up oh
[12:46:35] P get never mind it's not a cut scene
[12:46:37] that's how you can make sense of it but
[12:46:40] then it feels like we're going to have
[12:46:42] to share some truly shocking revelations
[12:46:45] let's hear them the first slate reveals
[12:46:48] that fontans are not real H what
[12:46:51] wait oh yeah cuz the ocean thing my bad
[12:46:54] I knew that incredible Lenny did you
[12:46:56] hear that
[12:46:58] we not real
[12:47:01] humans oh cuz they're French oh my god
[12:47:04] of course French PE yeah yeah allans
[12:47:08] were originally created by the late
[12:47:10] previous Hydro Aron with oids as their
[12:47:14] basis the evidence for that can be found
[12:47:17] in how only fontans could dissolve in
[12:47:20] primordial SE
[12:47:21] and how all the girls V dissolved were
[12:47:24] also turned into
[12:47:26] oids oh and according to Navia when she
[12:47:29] was about to get dissolved she also saw
[12:47:32] everyone gathered around for a trial all
[12:47:34] of them in the shape of
[12:47:37] oids
[12:47:41] indeed yeah and it follows from the
[12:47:43] content of the first slate that she
[12:47:46] probably anchored Celestia by creating
[12:47:49] humans without prior permission did that
[12:47:52] could also explain why the orri judged
[12:47:54] the hydro archon to be guilty it's to
[12:47:57] account for that ancient sin the hydro
[12:48:00] archon's true
[12:48:02] sin was creating us and yet after many
[12:48:07] hundreds of years the hydro archon's
[12:48:09] Creations have turned around to try to
[12:48:11] judge the archon within the Opera
[12:48:15] epicel the twists of History are often
[12:48:18] the most unexpected of all the third
[12:48:20] state I'm so come after the fourth yeah
[12:48:22] isn't the image here just like when
[12:48:24] Navia fell into the
[12:48:27] sea so wouldn't it be trying to show the
[12:48:30] image of the Hydra archon also falling
[12:48:32] into the sea once the prophecy has been
[12:48:34] fulfilled in the fourth slate in the end
[12:48:38] the people will all be dissolved into
[12:48:40] the waters and only the hydro archan
[12:48:42] will remain weeping on her throne only
[12:48:45] then will the sins of the people of
[12:48:47] Monon be washed away p that
[12:48:52] right you've made some Keen deductions I
[12:48:56] must say given how much you still don't
[12:48:57] know it is impressive that you've
[12:48:59] already managed to connect so many
[12:49:01] pieces of the truth why is Nev talking
[12:49:03] like he knows how the [ __ ] does this guy
[12:49:04] know able to decode all the information
[12:49:06] on the slates they've also been etched
[12:49:08] with an additional layer of hidden
[12:49:10] information using a different power
[12:49:12] source when we were at the ruins I tried
[12:49:15] to decipher the hidden information
[12:49:17] recorded in the slates but since we only
[12:49:20] had three slates at the time I was
[12:49:22] unable to come to a full conclusion now
[12:49:25] that the Slate collection is complete I
[12:49:27] shall make another attempt to decipher
[12:49:29] The Narrative recorded within if
[12:49:31] everything goes well we should finally
[12:49:33] be in unadulterated
[12:49:46] truth
[12:49:47] well did you get it I believe believe I
[12:49:50] should share this truth not only with
[12:49:52] you but with all the people of Fontaine
[12:49:54] as well I will try to Briefly summarize
[12:49:57] it for
[12:50:02] you your hypothesis regarding the origin
[12:50:05] of fontans and the sin of the hydro
[12:50:07] archon were both
[12:50:09] correct in the Fontaine of old the
[12:50:11] previous Hydro archon sensed the
[12:50:13] yearning of her oenid familiars for life
[12:50:16] on
[12:50:18] land yo are we murdering oceanids and
[12:50:22] hydros [ __ ] for fun oids were enamored
[12:50:24] with the beauty and Romanticism of human
[12:50:26] beings and wishing to have those
[12:50:28] experiences for themselves Express to
[12:50:30] the hydro archon their desire to become
[12:50:32] of a similar kind what if the end of
[12:50:34] genin impact it like vegan propagandas
[12:50:37] us where it's like we're killing all
[12:50:38] these enemies that are just normal
[12:50:39] people but getting turned or like life
[12:50:41] forms like like oceanids right and the
[12:50:43] hydro things and like the hilly trolls
[12:50:45] and we're just murdering them for fun
[12:50:46] for no reason so we should become
[12:50:48] pacifists that's the end of genin impact
[12:50:50] wow I predicted version 8.0 however even
[12:50:54] though water as an element is
[12:50:56] intricately linked with the power of
[12:50:57] Life the hydro archan as one of the
[12:51:00] seven did not possess the authority to
[12:51:02] create a new form of human life wait one
[12:51:04] of the seven wait like Jun cook not one
[12:51:08] to sorry I'll shut up she eventually
[12:51:10] found a way to create permanent humanoid
[12:51:12] bodies for her familiars by
[12:51:14] appropriating the power of this planet's
[12:51:15] primordial
[12:51:18] sea okay she poured primordial seawater
[12:51:21] into the oan its blood vessels creating
[12:51:24] humanoid mimics in the
[12:51:26] [Music]
[12:51:29] process but if fontans were to ever come
[12:51:32] into direct contact with water from the
[12:51:34] primordial sea the power within their
[12:51:37] bodies would Escape these artificial
[12:51:38] restraints and return to the Sea as a
[12:51:41] result their forms would collapse and
[12:51:44] they would be reverted to their original
[12:51:46] forms as
[12:51:49] oits
[12:51:52] of course the hydro Aron never received
[12:51:54] permission from the Heavenly principles
[12:51:56] to create a new human
[12:51:59] race and thus the hydro archon and all
[12:52:03] of her Creations came to shoulder the
[12:52:05] original sin of appropriating the power
[12:52:08] of the primordial
[12:52:09] sea that is the true history of how the
[12:52:12] people of Fontaine first came into
[12:52:16] being so you I we were all oan before we
[12:52:20] turned into human
[12:52:25] beings bro why do I have to oh an auto I
[12:52:28] was like what the that's way too much
[12:52:29] information for me I think I'm just
[12:52:31] going to pretend that I never heard a
[12:52:33] single
[12:52:36] thing wait but if that's the truth we
[12:52:38] can't let the hydro Aram be sentenced to
[12:52:40] death after all her only sin was
[12:52:42] creating us this there really might be
[12:52:45] too much information for your regular
[12:52:48] Fontan but it does a lot lot of our
[12:52:51] questions alas your hypothesis regarding
[12:52:53] the third and fourth Stone slates was in
[12:52:55] acccurate the slat's respective
[12:52:58] positions are in fact correct wait I
[12:53:01] literally called it when I saw it the
[12:53:02] first time I said it was them birthing
[12:53:05] the new archon is that is that not what
[12:53:07] literally it is the key point of the
[12:53:08] visual on the third slate is how all the
[12:53:11] individuals depicted in the water are
[12:53:13] humans rather than oits no okay my bad
[12:53:16] they have not been dissolved which
[12:53:18] implies that the water depicted in this
[12:53:20] is not water from the primordial sea I'm
[12:53:22] just I'll shut the nation of Fontaine is
[12:53:24] the nation of hydro as well as the
[12:53:26] nation of Trials and Justice instead of
[12:53:29] being the literal element the water in
[12:53:31] the scene symbolizes judgment and
[12:53:34] Justice you may also recall novia's
[12:53:36] experience when she fell into the sea
[12:53:39] her Consciousness was surrounded by that
[12:53:41] of many others who intended to hold the
[12:53:43] trial to determine her
[12:53:45] fate therefore the meaning of the third
[12:53:48] slate is that the people of Fontaine
[12:53:52] shall try the hydro archon at the court
[12:53:55] of
[12:53:57] justice wait what the [ __ ] exclamation
[12:54:00] mark exclamation mark exclamation
[12:54:04] mark yes it refers to our present
[12:54:08] situation I think I'm following now so
[12:54:12] what you're saying is even though we
[12:54:14] decided to put on this trial to avoid
[12:54:16] fulfilling the prophecy in truth
[12:54:19] everything we've done has happened
[12:54:21] exactly as the prophecy
[12:54:23] foretold so now it seems we're the ones
[12:54:27] making sure it comes
[12:54:30] true what should we do wait so you're
[12:54:33] telling me if we just took one more day
[12:54:36] to just [ __ ] think about how the
[12:54:39] stone tablets work we wouldn't have done
[12:54:41] the [ __ ]
[12:54:44] prophecy if REM died for it one day
[12:54:48] earlier no
[12:54:51] I don't know it feels like there's no
[12:54:53] way out of this no matter what the
[12:54:56] prophecy will be
[12:55:00] fulfilled is this what it feels like to
[12:55:02] be a prisoner of Fate if that's the case
[12:55:05] does that mean the scene in the fourth
[12:55:07] slate will also be fulfilled would still
[12:55:09] happen later not necessarily what if you
[12:55:11] figure out what the third slate is so
[12:55:12] you're like [ __ ] it we're not going to
[12:55:13] have a trial and then you literally nuke
[12:55:15] the people of Fontan in G you ask J Le
[12:55:17] to drop a meteor They're All Dead the
[12:55:19] prophecy can't be fulfilled cuz how
[12:55:20] could they judge you if they're dead
[12:55:21] true Trav sorry I would like to point
[12:55:23] out another small fallacy in your
[12:55:26] deductions about the fourth slate you
[12:55:29] probably thought that the eruption of
[12:55:30] primordial seawater Beneath The Fortress
[12:55:32] of meped served as the shest sign that
[12:55:35] the prophecy was about to come to pass
[12:55:37] yes sure I believe that rather than
[12:55:40] being a sure sign that eruption could in
[12:55:43] fact only be a small warning of
[12:55:44] something far worse to Come As for the
[12:55:47] root cause of the catastrophe I believe
[12:55:50] you've already encountered it once
[12:55:57] before we're going to be teleported to
[12:55:58] the
[12:56:00] Vermilion it's like a Vermilion artifact
[12:56:03] a small warning of the things to come we
[12:56:05] must find the root cause of the
[12:56:11] disaster what is the true source of the
[12:56:18] catastrophe I'm not going to look at
[12:56:19] chat the evidence that verifies the
[12:56:21] intrusion of the primordial sea it's not
[12:56:25] Linny honestly I don't know about child
[12:56:28] it actually could be
[12:56:32] child I mean the curse makes
[12:56:37] sense massive
[12:56:49] whale
[12:56:58] that
[12:56:59] doesn't that
[12:57:02] doesn't that doesn't bro I no I can't go
[12:57:05] on any of the oh it's a whale wait it
[12:57:07] was the whale and
[12:57:10] reality it's you I'm not a whale sorry
[12:57:13] if we're talking about a true culprit
[12:57:16] that could only be that thing inside the
[12:57:18] primordial sea right
[12:57:22] I'm not going to lie I got like everyone
[12:57:24] correct on the first try except this one
[12:57:25] so I'm just going to explain something
[12:57:27] really fast I lowy forgot because we did
[12:57:29] I this is why I don't like trailers I
[12:57:30] saw the whale in the trailer and I've
[12:57:31] been fighting the whale as a weekly boss
[12:57:33] for like 4 weeks now so I didn't know if
[12:57:35] me seeing the whale was just me seeing
[12:57:36] the whale or if I saw it actually in the
[12:57:38] Aron Quest and I kind of forgot about
[12:57:39] the whale anyway let's keep going the
[12:57:41] truth the original sin the and the root
[12:57:45] cause of the
[12:57:48] disaster
[12:58:02] oh oh
[12:58:08] no well at least we get to see skir
[12:58:17] whoa t
[12:58:24] surely a dragon clears a whale right
[12:58:26] never mind they're dead we're in
[12:58:28] [Music]
[12:58:29] boo
[12:58:32] oh the [ __ ] did this guy come from aren
[12:58:35] you in
[12:58:40] [Music]
[12:58:48] jail
[12:58:55] D yeah that well does not look damaged
[12:58:57] never mind he dipped okay maybe he is he
[12:59:00] looked exactly the
[12:59:01] same hey
[12:59:04] child dude imagine if this form was
[12:59:07] playable holy
[12:59:18] [ __ ]
[12:59:20] what the
[12:59:21] [ __ ] yo what that was way too close he
[12:59:25] just wandered that thing just burst into
[12:59:28] the Opera
[12:59:29] House wait was that the huge wheel you
[12:59:32] saw in your
[12:59:34] dream so we've met it at last I
[12:59:37] understand very well why it is chosen to
[12:59:39] make an appearance here BR said thumbs
[12:59:42] down and then dipped does not belong to
[12:59:44] that it is a monster that has traversed
[12:59:47] the Stars weeping all the while
[12:59:51] it has been greedily consuming the
[12:59:53] energy from the planet's primordial sea
[12:59:55] using it to grow that is the main cause
[12:59:58] for the rising sea levels the day is
[13:00:00] about to reset once it is finished
[13:00:02] consuming all of the energy contained
[13:00:04] within the sea it's next step will be
[13:00:07] you said that when the hydro archon
[13:00:09] first created fontans out of
[13:00:12] oids she filled their blood vessels with
[13:00:14] primordial seawater precisely that whale
[13:00:18] finds the blood of fanan nigh impossible
[13:00:21] to resist therefore when it left the
[13:00:24] primordial sea it decided to make its
[13:00:27] next stop a packed opera house full of
[13:00:29] food food in the form of
[13:00:32] fontans we just barely managed to push
[13:00:35] it back right in that case won't it come
[13:00:38] back to target the people again once
[13:00:40] it's managed to recover its strength
[13:00:42] that is correct indeed it is more
[13:00:45] accurate to say that we should thank
[13:00:46] that Harbinger for buying us some time
[13:00:49] without him
[13:00:50] the whale would have likely come onto
[13:00:51] land far sooner from the way he looked
[13:00:55] he must have been fighting the creature
[13:00:56] for quite a long
[13:00:59] time how is child okay battle Maniac
[13:01:03] we've always known that he had a special
[13:01:04] connection with that whale but we
[13:01:06] definitely didn't expect it to help us
[13:01:08] out like this anyway now that we know
[13:01:11] that this whale is the actual cause of
[13:01:13] the disaster recorded in the prophecy
[13:01:16] all we need to do to stop the prophecy
[13:01:18] would be to find a way to it up right it
[13:01:21] is too late what do you mean it had
[13:01:23] already absorbed too much of the
[13:01:25] primordial CE energy before we could
[13:01:27] notice it at this point it has become
[13:01:30] practically integrated with the sea
[13:01:32] itself even if the entirety of tat were
[13:01:35] to be destroyed it could still survive
[13:01:38] and swim off towards some other world
[13:01:41] that that's not something I will accept
[13:01:44] wait surely if that exists we're going
[13:01:45] to get the quantum void element soon
[13:01:47] right found the true culprit we're going
[13:01:49] to void character you've come so far you
[13:01:52] can't just tell me that the last hurdle
[13:01:54] is some impossible foe that's just
[13:01:58] indeed that's not how a grand
[13:01:59] performance should end I'll fight it to
[13:02:02] the end no matter what okay I mean I
[13:02:05] respect that prophecy will be fulfilled
[13:02:07] no matter what
[13:02:14] huh dot do dot the prophecy yes what has
[13:02:18] been prophesized will be fulfilled you
[13:02:21] may view such things as the history of
[13:02:23] the
[13:02:30] future after everything it still turned
[13:02:31] out like this we couldn't fight against
[13:02:34] fate but wait if this is all about fate
[13:02:37] just as prophecies are usually only the
[13:02:40] future as seen from the perspectives of
[13:02:42] the Gods could things be happening in
[13:02:45] Hidden Corners where the God's gaze does
[13:02:48] not fall
[13:02:55] ultimately fate Shall Serve as your only
[13:02:58] guide no matter what will happen in
[13:03:00] Tat's
[13:03:02] future all you need to do is to Play
[13:03:06] Your
[13:03:12] Part could be that you the prophecy we
[13:03:14] fulfilled there will still be a way to
[13:03:15] save everyone did I miss
[13:03:18] something
[13:03:23] wait I forgot about finina what is it
[13:03:24] that you want to say to me at the last
[13:03:25] moment in the Box what is her real
[13:03:36] secret yo what the [ __ ] is happening
[13:03:39] what's happening with the
[13:03:41] orrice I believe it is preparing to
[13:03:44] carry out the death
[13:03:48] sentence
[13:03:51] or she's going to start weeping on her
[13:03:57] throne no I still need
[13:04:03] [Music]
[13:04:11] [Music]
[13:04:18] answers
[13:04:22] [Music]
[13:04:25] the [ __ ] is
[13:04:27] that bro what
[13:04:31] the what the [ __ ] was
[13:04:34] that do I have to play
[13:04:41] no why is she
[13:04:46] Barefoot you
[13:04:49] [Laughter]
[13:04:51] oh
[13:04:53] finina sorry that shocked expression on
[13:04:57] your face is just too amusing but I like
[13:04:59] her voice I couldn't help myself yo can
[13:05:01] she be
[13:05:02] playable you are not
[13:05:05] finina who are you coore ah The Sweet
[13:05:09] Sound of
[13:05:11] bewilderment marvelous a sure sign that
[13:05:14] my attempt to deceive everyone was a
[13:05:16] resounding
[13:05:17] success but answer your question I am
[13:05:22] falor you know the God
[13:05:26] falor why did you deceive
[13:05:29] us oh that wasn't my goal of course
[13:05:33] goodness no but I had to fool everyone
[13:05:37] else too if I was to stand any chance of
[13:05:40] deceiving the Heavenly
[13:05:43] principles deceiving the Heavenly
[13:05:46] principles it's all because of that that
[13:05:49] pernicious prophecy Dreadful wasn't it
[13:05:53] everyone doomed to dissolve Fontaine
[13:05:56] condemned to be flooded one was not
[13:05:59] amused in fact one was positively beused
[13:06:03] when that problem was thrust upon me by
[13:06:06] my dearest
[13:06:07] predecessor that's the former Hydro Aron
[13:06:10] egeria for the
[13:06:12] uninitiated it hardly gets more
[13:06:14] disastrous than a pre-ordained national
[13:06:17] catastrophe now does
[13:06:20] she knew full well that the prophecy
[13:06:22] would surely come to pass and as one of
[13:06:26] the seven She also knew full well that
[13:06:29] one defies the Heavenly principles at
[13:06:32] one's Peril so yes as you have no doubt
[13:06:36] surmised it was a rather impossible
[13:06:40] situation that I found myself in I spent
[13:06:43] a terribly long time mulling it over
[13:06:46] alone on the ocean floor and I was
[13:06:50] almost growing Barnacles by the time I
[13:06:52] finally
[13:06:54] realized there was only one possible
[13:06:56] solution to this confounding conundrum
[13:07:00] English I had to outwit the Heavenly
[13:07:03] principles allow the prophecy to be
[13:07:06] fulfilled ostensibly at least while
[13:07:09] saving everyone at the same
[13:07:12] time I'm a genius I know I can only
[13:07:16] assume that's why egeria chose me as her
[13:07:19] successor although Looking Back Now it
[13:07:22] was hardly The Inheritance one dreams of
[13:07:26] between the task of saving the nation
[13:07:29] the quotidian duties of the Hydra Aron
[13:07:32] and not to mention the original sin of
[13:07:35] creating a new race of humans I dare say
[13:07:38] she left me quite a colossal mess to
[13:07:41] clean
[13:07:43] up that one can only play the hand one
[13:07:47] is dealt I did did not choose this
[13:07:50] anymore than I chose to be one of her
[13:07:53] oenid
[13:07:54] familiars so you were also once one of
[13:07:57] the oits transformed into a human by
[13:08:00] eia's hand yes I was I always dreamed of
[13:08:06] becoming human and I still do even now
[13:08:11] in my eyes to be human is to be part of
[13:08:15] the greatest Opera ever known after
[13:08:19] becoming a God I separated my Divinity
[13:08:22] from my body and spirit leaving behind
[13:08:25] only a self that was as naive and
[13:08:28] bewildered as my past self on her first
[13:08:31] day as a human what the [ __ ] the me you
[13:08:34] see before you now is that Divinity and
[13:08:38] the human counterpart I left behind I
[13:08:42] named Fina she could feel Joy sorrow and
[13:08:47] everything in between she could be as
[13:08:49] Vain and conceited or as Meek and
[13:08:53] vulnerable as she wished her strengths
[13:08:57] were of a Kind only a human could
[13:09:00] possess as were her
[13:09:02] shortcomings but in my eyes fina's
[13:09:06] Humanity was what made her
[13:09:09] perfect she was perfectly human in every
[13:09:13] way the person I always wanted to be
[13:09:18] anyway she
[13:09:19] then I cursed
[13:09:20] her yo what the [ __ ] there all part of
[13:09:25] the plan of course the plan to deceive
[13:09:28] the Heavenly
[13:09:31] principles do you still remember the
[13:09:34] anyway so de I cursed her the Hydra
[13:09:37] archon alone weeping on her throne in
[13:09:42] order that the prophecy might appear
[13:09:44] fulfilled I invited finina to be an
[13:09:47] actress to play the part of the hydro
[13:09:50] archon in the prophecy under the curse I
[13:09:54] placed on her so long as I fur's
[13:09:58] Divinity continued to exist she could
[13:10:02] not die but nor was she free to live her
[13:10:05] life in the pursuit of
[13:10:07] happiness instead she was forced to take
[13:10:11] the stage in the opera house to embrace
[13:10:14] the role of Leading Lady to Forever play
[13:10:17] the part of the God from the prophecy
[13:10:21] all to create a deceitful appearance of
[13:10:24] that prophecy coming to pass I suppose
[13:10:27] now you probably understand why your
[13:10:30] court is called the Opera
[13:10:32] epicel but finina is only human isn't
[13:10:36] she even though she has had a long life
[13:10:40] her mind is no stronger than that of any
[13:10:42] other ordinary human being I cannot
[13:10:45] begin to Fathom what she has had to
[13:10:47] endure
[13:10:49] it must have been torture for her it has
[13:10:53] indeed and although she is in a sense me
[13:10:57] in human form I most definitely owe her
[13:11:01] an apology for
[13:11:02] it it's been 500 years and all along
[13:11:08] she's been playing her part in the most
[13:11:12] unimaginably long unbearably lonely and
[13:11:17] agonizingly painful Opa of all time
[13:11:26] well man [ __ ] you
[13:11:31] falor you made finina
[13:11:47] Cry
[13:11:49] in 500 years of suffering like I get why
[13:11:52] she did it but [ __ ] you it's like when

[13:16:17] not bad
[13:16:19] let's go with that Mir
[13:16:22] me what do you wish to say the
[13:16:27] prophecy have you heard of it what
[13:16:32] prophecy wait I
[13:16:35] know I think I don't know why but it's
[13:16:40] in my head
[13:16:42] somehow the people will all be dissolved
[13:16:45] into the waters and only only the hydro
[13:16:49] archon will remain weeping on her throne
[13:16:53] only then will the sins of the people of
[13:16:56] Fontaine be washed away
[13:17:00] oh very good you know it well what's
[13:17:05] going
[13:17:06] on I can't seem to remember anything
[13:17:11] clearly the only thing I know for sure
[13:17:14] is this
[13:17:16] prophecy will it really come to
[13:17:20] pass yes it will and that is why I've
[13:17:25] come to you disaster will come to
[13:17:28] Fontaine sooner or later things will
[13:17:32] develop just as the prophecy
[13:17:34] declared there is no escaping it but
[13:17:39] doesn't that mean everyone will die I'm
[13:17:42] a fanian just like them will I dissolve
[13:17:47] too
[13:17:50] oh don't worry magical meetings exist in
[13:17:53] this world precisely to give people a
[13:17:56] chance to turn things
[13:17:58] around it is the reason why you met me
[13:18:01] today I will tell you how to save
[13:18:04] everyone but you may have to suffer
[13:18:09] somewhat
[13:18:10] again
[13:18:12] oh so there's still hope after all
[13:18:16] goodness you frighten me
[13:18:18] you spoke so much and with so much
[13:18:22] certainty as for the suffering well I
[13:18:27] will admit that the first thing that
[13:18:29] came to mind was oh this the past have
[13:18:31] to be the one to suffer I forgot of the
[13:18:34] camera if the prophecy will come true
[13:18:37] the suffering is what know die anyway
[13:18:39] right so if I've already met you as my
[13:18:43] magical meeting in this world if there
[13:18:46] were scales with all the people of
[13:18:49] Fontaine on one side and my pain on the
[13:18:53] other is it not obvious where the scales
[13:18:56] should
[13:18:59] tilt you truly are the perfect human my
[13:19:05] ideal I suppose this would also be the
[13:19:08] justice that belongs to you huh don't
[13:19:12] worry it's nothing listen well Fontaine
[13:19:17] has just lost its Hydro archon I need
[13:19:21] you to play a role that of the new
[13:19:25] archon play as a God that's right you
[13:19:32] must begin a NeverEnding
[13:19:35] masquerade you must never let anyone
[13:19:38] suspect your
[13:19:40] identity if you can keep it up then I
[13:19:43] shall have my way of defying this
[13:19:46] prophecy but should your identity be
[13:19:51] revealed then all hope will be lost D
[13:19:56] but how will I do this a human assuming
[13:20:00] the role of a god without being
[13:20:03] exposed don't worry what you must do is
[13:20:07] not to turn yourself into a real God you
[13:20:11] simply need to play the role of a God as
[13:20:14] humans imagine them to be being a human
[13:20:17] in yourself I'm sure you already know
[13:20:21] what such an entity would be like
[13:20:24] remember your true challenge will not be
[13:20:28] pursuing
[13:20:29] Divinity but contending Against
[13:20:33] Humanity um I'm still not sure I
[13:20:37] understand
[13:20:38] but I'll
[13:20:40] try I'll try to do this so how long am I
[13:20:45] going to have to play this role
[13:20:48] to accomplish this Mission you will have
[13:20:52] to stay on the stage for many many years
[13:20:56] you will endure and not grow old until
[13:20:59] your task ends but I promise you all
[13:21:05] will eventually end in a magnificent and
[13:21:09] dramatic trial and everyone will be
[13:21:12] saved copium what about silver what
[13:21:15] about Malo how exciting
[13:21:19] I'll be looking forward to
[13:21:28] it CH how many years did Chia have to
[13:21:30] suff sorry not going to make this about
[13:21:46] Chia
[13:21:54] s CH if you have to okay let's say you
[13:21:56] have to like fake being the archon right
[13:21:58] can't she just have a police state and
[13:21:59] then just have like a whole military
[13:22:01] enforcing that she's the
[13:22:04] archon I'm sorry where the [ __ ] am I
[13:22:07] going oh it's
[13:22:10] thrown Ryden no don't
[13:22:16] dude
[13:22:24] the Maison Cardinal has announced my
[13:22:27] accession but this is my first time
[13:22:30] facing the
[13:22:33] people what should I say to most appear
[13:22:37] like a god to be honest I still don't
[13:22:41] know perhaps I should first try to act
[13:22:45] natural courage
[13:22:48] ladies and gentlemen good evening and
[13:22:52] welcome to the Opera epic Clays I'm sure
[13:22:56] you've all heard about how I have taken
[13:22:58] on the role of hydro archon indeed I am
[13:23:02] finina de Fontaine your new
[13:23:06] archon pure Earnest in truth I know
[13:23:10] little about becoming a nation's new God
[13:23:13] but it will be my honor to guide you all
[13:23:17] as the god falor the God of Justice I
[13:23:21] shall do all within my power to lead you
[13:23:24] into an age of fairness and Justice
[13:23:27] close politely once again thank you all
[13:23:30] for coming you're welcome if you should
[13:23:32] have any questions or suggestions please
[13:23:36] send them to the Maison cardinalis the
[13:23:39] future of Fontaine will require us to
[13:23:41] work together after all this should do
[13:23:45] it I thought I might stammer but
[13:23:48] thankfully I was able to con my thoughts
[13:23:51] just fine okay and next that's the new
[13:23:56] Hydro archon is this some kind of joke
[13:24:00] [ __ ] you I would have thought that a
[13:24:01] being that surpasses Humanity would be a
[13:24:03] bit more
[13:24:05] assertive hey did you hear that she even
[13:24:08] told us to send her suggestions there at
[13:24:10] the end shouldn't Gods be all powerful
[13:24:14] she's being so modest what's the
[13:24:17] difference between her and an ordinary
[13:24:19] person
[13:24:20] then if you ask me perhaps the
[13:24:23] succession didn't actually happen she
[13:24:25] might just be a maon back puppet wait
[13:24:29] what's going
[13:24:30] on why is everyone suspecting me of
[13:24:33] being a
[13:24:34] fake this is bad if I get exposed here
[13:24:39] there'll be no saving the people from
[13:24:40] the
[13:24:41] prophecy right M me said that I just
[13:24:45] need to play the role of a god as humans
[13:24:48] imagine them to be calm down finina
[13:24:52] think think what do the people want how
[13:24:56] would they imagine a God to speak and
[13:24:59] act assertive with a strong sense of
[13:25:02] presence one who can dispel all
[13:25:05] doubt that is the character I'm faded to
[13:25:08] play um that's why they made
[13:25:14] her yeah y the actually popped off very
[13:25:19] good my she was forced to be I almost
[13:25:21] said Annoying but I don't know if the
[13:25:22] word is arant
[13:25:25] guess now I was wondering if some weak
[13:25:30] puppet were to one day come on to the
[13:25:32] stage and claim ownership of this opera
[13:25:35] house would the children of Fontaine
[13:25:38] follow
[13:25:40] them well it seems that you would all
[13:25:43] see right through them having passed my
[13:25:46] test you are qual qualified to witness
[13:25:48] wondrous trials alongside my AUST self
[13:25:52] here in this house I have a question
[13:25:56] okay we know why finina acts this way
[13:25:57] now does anyone know why fishal acts
[13:25:58] this way finina we get it now we know
[13:26:00] the lore behind it makes sense why is
[13:26:01] fishal acting like this though like why
[13:26:04] okay you may consider my previous act a
[13:26:07] door gift of sorts I thought it was a
[13:26:10] debut that suited the
[13:26:14] atmosphere oh was it explaining the
[13:26:16] event oh yeah the [ __ ] official event
[13:26:19] okay I forgot about that yeah I remember
[13:26:21] that event okay I mean all right
[13:26:24] whatever fine I rest my case I mean I
[13:26:27] I
[13:26:29] concede now then let us be
[13:26:34] [Music]
[13:26:35] reintroduced ah so that was just a
[13:26:38] performance how could I have forgotten
[13:26:40] that we were inside an opera
[13:26:42] house her personality it's quite
[13:26:46] shocking to be honest but suppose it's a
[13:26:48] better look than before such a
[13:26:51] fascinating and full deity how wonderful
[13:26:55] our future may yet be bright after
[13:26:59] all it seems I've turned them around
[13:27:02] best follow this flow and restart my
[13:27:05] accession speech resolutely with
[13:27:07] conviction my dear people whether you
[13:27:10] acknowledge me or not whether you trust
[13:27:13] me or nay I say to you keep in your
[13:27:17] order for
[13:27:21] justice we have heard it said that this
[13:27:24] nation's sins can no longer be washed
[13:27:26] away well I say that Justice is most
[13:27:30] fragrant when it blooms amid sin [ __ ]
[13:27:33] turn up the drama scales of Justice
[13:27:36] should not weigh heavy in the hands of
[13:27:38] its God on one side it must carry
[13:27:42] fairness and
[13:27:43] Justice and on the other pise and
[13:27:48] laws May law be the prayer on our lips
[13:27:52] May judgment be our worship let us light
[13:27:57] the fires and drink to the future of
[13:28:00] Fontaine there actually different
[13:28:01] options based on what I click there is
[13:28:04] no trouble in this world that Justice
[13:28:07] cannot solve all that is needed is for
[13:28:11] you my people to believe in it heart and
[13:28:15] soul so so long as I the archon falor
[13:28:20] stand within the Opera at the C so long
[13:28:23] as I stand before the

[13:29:52] kind of trial are you truly looking
[13:29:54] forward to a magnificent dramatic and
[13:29:58] wondrous trial a trial to end all
[13:30:05] things how could you hope to understand
[13:30:09] that's true I fear I lack the ability to
[13:30:11] grasp Your Divine thought lady archon no
[13:30:15] need for fright and do not take what I
[13:30:17] said before too
[13:30:19] seriously go now do your duties the
[13:30:23] trial I await it will come one day
[13:30:39] [Music]

[13:30:52] lady finina I don't know what to say
[13:30:55] thank you for agreeing to see me no need
[13:30:58] to thank me rather thank your own sense
[13:31:01] of perseverance instead long have you
[13:31:04] stood in line to meet me have you
[13:31:08] not oh I'm afraid that's just an
[13:31:11] inevitable consequence of my Divine
[13:31:14] charm all right deot IA is it how is
[13:31:18] your son's
[13:31:20] illness you remembered me and you knew
[13:31:24] of my family too of course I'm a go he's
[13:31:27] doing much better now in fact he is far
[13:31:29] more of an art and believer than I he
[13:31:32] was the one who forced me to seek an
[13:31:34] audience with you and to bring your
[13:31:36] words back to
[13:31:38] him oh good very good if this should
[13:31:43] happen again in the future please do not
[13:31:46] hesitate to come and and tell me going
[13:31:48] down to Citizens homes every so often
[13:31:51] well not usual practice should serve as
[13:31:53] a fine change of
[13:31:55] pace you're such a gentle and wise God
[13:31:59] thank you once again on behalf of my
[13:32:06] [Music]
[13:32:15] son
[13:32:28] lady finina here are the latest
[13:32:31] hydrological reports as for the specific
[13:32:34] parameters you asked to take note of I'm
[13:32:37] afraid things still don't look good I
[13:32:40] see it's as I thought then as your God I
[13:32:45] did already expect this but I wanted to
[13:32:47] see how far your human wisdom would
[13:32:50] allow you to analyze it all manner of
[13:32:53] signs indicate that the prophecy will
[13:32:56] still come to pass forget it that's not
[13:33:00] something you need to worry about right
[13:33:03] now well as I understand it the Fontaine
[13:33:06] Research Institute is also trying to
[13:33:08] find a way to counter the rising water
[13:33:09] levels really have they found anything
[13:33:14] I'm afraid that they haven't found any
[13:33:16] effect solution thus far
[13:33:19] okay is that so well no wonder this
[13:33:24] issue has reached the realm of the Gods
[13:33:26] after all still their spirit is
[13:33:33] praiseworthy this is the last one am I
[13:33:36] sleeping

[13:33:55] Suspicion maybe this is
[13:33:57] fine I just need to keep going and

[13:36:56] people that are annoying you just kill

[13:37:18] I'm saying finina could have but she
[13:37:19] didn't which is good good for her I'm
[13:37:22] glad she didn't I'm glad she didn't this
[13:37:26] must be the Overflow of hydro from my
[13:37:29] person well can't quite help being the
[13:37:32] god whose Dominion is the waters can
[13:37:36] I no wonder no wonder a manifestation of
[13:37:41] your power then oh archon I am honored
[13:37:44] to have witnessed it honored
[13:37:48] [Music]
[13:37:51] indeed so
[13:37:58] interminable so
[13:38:01] lonely just how much
[13:38:05] longer hundreds of years must have
[13:38:08] passed by
[13:38:10] now perhaps The Show Must Go On for
[13:38:13] hundreds more I never
[13:38:16] imagine that it would hurt so
[13:38:21] much have
[13:38:23] I reached my
[13:38:27] limit
[13:38:29] no perhaps I reached it long
[13:38:33] ago today I didn't even notice my own
[13:38:38] tears I want to tell someone anyone
[13:38:43] about
[13:38:44] this but that not destroy all I've done
[13:38:48] so
[13:38:50] far I've conducted so many
[13:38:53] investigations across the
[13:38:56] centuries but there's not even a sliver
[13:39:00] of hope that we might break the prophecy
[13:39:04] all I can do is keep
[13:39:07] heart I must maintain this
[13:39:11] act it is the only way to save Fontaine
[13:39:17] please mirror
[13:39:19] me you have to
[13:39:23] succeed
[13:39:29] Bo finina
[13:39:37] and finina you don't have to shoulder
[13:39:40] this burden alone although I don't know
[13:39:43] what you might be keeping from everyone
[13:39:45] your people are more than willing to
[13:39:47] share your burden with
[13:39:55] you I think see play Inner world I find
[13:39:58] what you want to tell me my
[13:40:01] burden that's impossible it was faded
[13:40:05] right from the start that this would be
[13:40:07] my duty alone but even if your burden
[13:40:10] doesn't need to be shared you can still
[13:40:13] choose to confide in someone just share
[13:40:16] it with me I'm what you'd call a witness
[13:40:20] a
[13:40:22] witness yes I've heard that you came to
[13:40:26] toat from beyond the stars yes in other
[13:40:29] words you never belonged here and if to
[13:40:33] that is in its entirety a show on a
[13:40:36] stage then you're just a spectator
[13:40:39] aren't
[13:40:41] you if that's the
[13:40:45] case
[13:40:47] she's right I could confide in her she
[13:40:51] was literally about to and I got [ __ ]
[13:40:53] ruined if things don't play out as
[13:40:56] expected the people of Fontaine will be
[13:40:58] the ones to pay the price no finina you
[13:41:03] shouldn't bro fin is the only character
[13:41:04] that can make me stop
[13:41:06] talking but what
[13:41:08] if what if it's really all right finina
[13:41:13] you've worked so hard for so long so
[13:41:17] long surely it would be okay to put
[13:41:19] yourself first for
[13:41:21] once just this once is it such an
[13:41:25] outrageous thing to do anyway to find
[13:41:28] someone in whom you can confide to your
[13:41:30] frustration why do we do this a day
[13:41:33] earlier surely we could have been her
[13:41:36] friend if you let this opportunity slip
[13:41:39] through your fingers it might never come
[13:41:42] by again think about it why don't we
[13:41:45] just go to we should have went from
[13:41:46] monat straight to Fontan skip sumaru
[13:41:49] skip inauma
[13:41:51] just swim
[13:42:02] [Music]
[13:42:04] there no I have nothing to say I am
[13:42:08] finina the archon of
[13:42:11] Fontaine everything will surely get
[13:42:14] better never mind all you need need to
[13:42:16] do dear spectator is to witness my
[13:42:20] performance until the curtains
[13:42:32] fall
[13:42:39] fine oh Line's
[13:42:44] pissed s
[13:42:48] so even finina doesn't know the truth
[13:42:51] you've never once let her in on the full
[13:42:54] plan yes it had to be done to deceive
[13:42:58] the Heavenly principles you must first
[13:43:01] deceive
[13:43:02] yourself she did very well if she had
[13:43:05] let her resolve falter even once in
[13:43:08] these five centuries Fontaine would have
[13:43:11] been doomed to the most tragic fate it
[13:43:15] seems that that trusting Humanity was
[13:43:18] the right decision after all I believe
[13:43:21] that I understand how your deception
[13:43:24] works but that is only half the truth is
[13:43:27] it not how would you build on this
[13:43:29] Foundation to save the people of
[13:43:31] Fontaine true that is the most important
[13:43:34] thing true ah good good you better have
[13:43:38] a good you better have a good
[13:43:39] explanation Fon has pinpointed the Crux
[13:43:41] of the issue Crux I'm sure you've long
[13:43:44] since that the or is no simple machine
[13:43:48] yes I've always suspected that it had
[13:43:51] its own Consciousness and Lenny did
[13:43:53] mention that he heard a human voice
[13:43:55] within the core chamber it now seems
[13:43:58] that that person was you hidden within
[13:44:01] the machine all along am I right and
[13:44:04] then I became one with the
[13:44:07] orries taking fontaine's noses with me
[13:44:11] yes it would seem so wouldn't it alas
[13:44:15] your understanding of this device still
[13:44:18] lacks sufficient depth in truth it is no
[13:44:22] enactor of Justice it is in fact a
[13:44:27] device created to kill the God of
[13:44:32] Justice I beg your pardon the [ __ ] is
[13:44:36] happening you have it and to be more
[13:44:40] precise not only will the orries take
[13:44:43] down the God of Justice it will also
[13:44:46] take down the Divine Throne upon which
[13:44:49] she has been
[13:44:51] placed I mean did you think I would be
[13:44:55] the sort to enjoy peaceful Repose Mal
[13:44:58] Farina suffered my work over these last
[13:45:02] 500 years has been to constantly
[13:45:05] accumulate indom nidum within the
[13:45:07] orries but really some have already
[13:45:11] discovered that only a small fraction of
[13:45:13] the energy generated by the device was
[13:45:15] ever used to provide Power to
[13:45:18] Fontaine the vast majority has been had
[13:45:22] to be
[13:45:24] accumulated to enact this death sentence
[13:45:28] it was all part of your plan then both
[13:45:32] the trial and the sentence indeed this
[13:45:36] power accured over five centuries could
[13:45:40] have sustained fontans for Millennia had
[13:45:43] it only been used for that purpose
[13:45:46] almost all of it has now been stored
[13:45:48] within the
[13:45:49] orries but only Power of this magnitude
[13:45:53] could hope to destroy the hydro archon's
[13:45:56] Divine Throne shaking the rules
[13:45:59] established by said [ __ ] the system and
[13:46:02] breaking through the institution that is
[13:46:04] the seven so the Orr's call for death
[13:46:07] was for neither finina nor falor but for
[13:46:10] the hydro
[13:46:12] Aron the destruction of that Divine
[13:46:15] throne
[13:46:16] if I do not misunderstand your intent
[13:46:19] you must be returning what's rightfully
[13:46:22] yours to you of course wa what in other
[13:46:25] words this was all done to return the
[13:46:28] authority of the hydro archon to the
[13:46:31] Hydro Dragon of this
[13:46:33] planet
[13:46:36] but wait no wonder never that's [ __ ]
[13:46:43] Broken Oh what getting sad again are we
[13:46:48] the authority of the ancient dragons
[13:46:50] shall soon be yours once more oh Hydro
[13:46:54] Dragon
[13:46:55] Sovereign and this is the face you
[13:46:58] make
[13:47:00] Dum F we've done throughout the years
[13:47:03] it's just wait let us pull for her
[13:47:05] before she dies at the very
[13:47:08] end I've never quite seen it that way
[13:47:11] you know even now I'm quite pleased at
[13:47:14] how well my deception
[13:47:28] worked Hydro Dragon hydr Dragon don't
[13:47:37] cry I must say had it been within my
[13:47:40] rights I would have loved to judge the
[13:47:43] Heavenly principles themselves
[13:47:46] were they not guilty of essentially the
[13:47:48] same crime aeria stole the power of the
[13:47:52] primordial Sea and the Heavenly
[13:47:55] principle stole the power you ancient
[13:47:57] dragons
[13:47:58] possessed I for my part I the God of
[13:48:02] Justice and is it not just that your
[13:48:05] original Powers should be returned to
[13:48:08] you speaking of Justice I have always
[13:48:12] believed that Justice lies in the
[13:48:14] process of pursuing human existence
[13:48:17] itself so if the theft of the primordial
[13:48:20] se's might was fontaine's original
[13:48:23] sin then leaving matters of procedural
[13:48:27] right and wrong aside The Descent of the
[13:48:29] fontans as humans and their right to
[13:48:32] exist in this world would be fontaine's
[13:48:35] original
[13:48:37] Justice in other words existence was
[13:48:41] aerious Justice and to me Justice is the
[13:48:46] continuation of that existence okay
[13:48:49] defying the prophecy and ensuring that
[13:48:52] fontaine's people shall live
[13:48:54] on that should be the Justice enthroned
[13:48:57] over all others at this point we whether
[13:49:03] it be myself or all other
[13:49:07] fontans have shouldered the burden of
[13:49:10] this sin for far too long udex net
[13:49:15] the highest judge in our land when you
[13:49:19] regain your full power as an elemental
[13:49:23] Sovereign what verdict shall you pass
[13:49:26] upon us so when I was invited to the
[13:49:29] court of Fontaine to serve as
[13:49:31] udex I see now that that was your idea
[13:49:35] too at last I Now understand the true
[13:49:39] purpose behind this position in the
[13:49:41] beginning I was uninterested in human
[13:49:44] existence but these five centuries of
[13:49:47] living alongside them have gradually
[13:49:49] brought about Mutual understanding
[13:49:50] between us and I have even attempted to
[13:49:53] feel as they feel you are a devious one
[13:49:57] for salur that was a pretty [ __ ] 5D
[13:50:00] plan things being as they are surely you
[13:50:03] know that I could never declare them to
[13:50:05] be
[13:50:13] guilty yo ah
[13:50:16] the hour of execution is almost oh my
[13:50:18] God she's dead for The Sinner The
[13:50:21] Curtain Call has come at least give us a
[13:50:24] skin I know I may not sound it but faced
[13:50:28] with death I find myself a little
[13:50:31] afraid perhaps this is one thing both
[13:50:34] gods and humans have in
[13:50:42] common farewell nervet
[13:50:46] I hope you've enjoyed the part you
[13:50:47] played these 500
[13:50:56] [Music]
[13:51:09] years Chad can I Al that four before he
[13:51:14] dies
[13:51:23] [Music]
[13:51:34] wait why did Finas
[13:51:44] have
[13:51:46] [Music]
[13:51:58] [Music]
[13:52:13] down
[13:52:18] [Music]
[13:52:27] [Music]
[13:52:33] oh
[13:52:34] [Music]
[13:52:36] nevertheless I udex
[13:52:39] select hereby
[13:52:42] declare people of Fontaine your sins are
[13:52:55] forgiven
[13:53:10] udge bro what
[13:53:13] the
[13:53:29] bro what just
[13:53:31] happened has the death sentence been
[13:53:34] carriedo what the [ __ ] was that is that
[13:53:36] bright light some also we still have a m
[13:53:38] skirk so the quest isn't even
[13:53:40] over but since we're all still alive and
[13:53:43] haven't been dissolved I assume whatever
[13:53:45] happened was good for us it's time to
[13:53:48] end this we must meet out punishment to
[13:53:50] that
[13:53:52] Beast can you say just a moment ago that
[13:53:55] it can't be
[13:53:56] defeated I have gained the strength
[13:53:58] sufficient to deal with it through
[13:54:01] certain means I now have the ability to
[13:54:04] separate the power of the primordial Sea
[13:54:06] from that creature we should seize the
[13:54:09] opportunity to pursue our Quarry you
[13:54:12] obtained power just now now that or can
[13:54:15] no longer function I require an Executor
[13:54:18] to help me meet out Justice the root of
[13:54:21] the calamities befalling Fontaine the
[13:54:23] Beast that enacts the prophecy its name
[13:54:27] is the all devouring narwhal come with
[13:54:30] me
[13:54:31] traveler the hour of execution has

[13:54:59] Dum we're to execute it but how are we
[13:55:03] going to do that it's
[13:55:06] huge I've already done my best to
[13:55:08] separate power my SE from the way
[13:55:11] considering the size of least I cannot
[13:55:13] reach the power source
[13:55:15] wait we still haven't seen where Fin's
[13:55:16] outfits come from right CU she's only
[13:55:18] white in
[13:55:21] the drag power with you we shall look
[13:55:24] for an opening to
[13:55:28] go story Quest
[13:55:31] oh can feel it sorrow turning into
[13:55:41] [Music]
[13:55:43] hostility
[13:55:46] evil
[13:55:47] conquering
[13:55:50] here worthless why are you typing whale
[13:55:54] versus whale I'm not a whale to trigger
[13:55:57] it hostility chance will present
[13:56:07] itself it's whale versus normal
[13:56:13] player
[13:56:14] [Music]
[13:56:18] why is well this soundtrack is [ __ ]
[13:56:21] sick really
[13:56:23] scary I don't know if I've heard it
[13:56:32] before may I
[13:56:36] present
[13:56:41] behold I have granted you my protection
[13:56:44] do do not fear seize the moment and use
[13:56:47] my power to suppress wait did I not just
[13:56:49] apply usia to it I did right okay let's
[13:56:52] kill it
[13:56:56] now cry
[13:56:59] louder The Wind
[13:57:13] Rises
[13:57:20] the fact that this whale looks Hydro but
[13:57:22] is not Hydro immune proves that the void
[13:57:24] element will come in
[13:57:27] time we will be getting a void character
[13:57:30] or because this whale is void true or
[13:57:33] Abyss whatever Abyss
[13:57:36] element the
[13:57:39] [ __ ]
[13:57:43] oh
[13:57:47] did she just throw
[13:57:50] CH wait that other outfit was wait is it
[13:57:53] the same outfit what the [ __ ] wait
[13:57:56] thanks for helping with the cleanup it
[13:57:58] should have been my job but respectfully
[13:58:01] respectfully respectfully respectfully
[13:58:04] this side is so much cooler I'm sorry
[13:58:06] this looks sick compared to the I mean I
[13:58:08] guess they're both cool but start
[13:58:09] brawling in the meantime I like that
[13:58:11] color palette a lot better move your cam
[13:58:13] why I'm literally nothing yeah it's
[13:58:16] jingu well actually I had a feeling that
[13:58:19] it would happen at some point but they
[13:58:21] bumped into one another earlier than I
[13:58:23] thought what a
[13:58:25] blunder I suppose I'll have to swing my
[13:58:28] sword 3 million times as
[13:58:30] penants yeah I mean I've talked about
[13:58:32] this before I think she looks good I
[13:58:33] think she looks a little too how do I
[13:58:35] say this I think her face is a little
[13:58:36] too young to be like the [ __ ] child
[13:58:38] Master that's been in the void for like
[13:58:40] 28 Millennia but I still think she looks
[13:58:42] sick so disciple your Master's pet that
[13:58:46] power who are you
[13:58:52] exactly Pon has an idea from what she
[13:58:55] said earlier she must be child's Master
[13:58:57] maybe she looks like she's from honkai
[13:58:59] cuz she's in the abyss right and then
[13:59:01] the last region of genin we go to the
[13:59:04] abyss then what happens the final quest
[13:59:07] D's Leaf comes out we meet our twin we
[13:59:09] fight we end up close our eyes wake up
[13:59:12] welcome aboard the astral Express we go
[13:59:15] into star rail it continues from
[13:59:21] genin yo what if the last planet in star
[13:59:24] that we explore is
[13:59:26] monat is that even monat no it's not
[13:59:29] it's just that he has the impression
[13:59:31] that she was
[13:59:32] the look at her eyes look I simply did
[13:59:36] not have anything to say yeah they're
[13:59:37] [ __ ] like red pink black pink black
[13:59:41] shut up manag to defeat the all
[13:59:44] devouring narwhal without using power
[13:59:46] from Beyond this
[13:59:49] world she is pretty cool though like so
[13:59:51] you may speak to me color palet
[13:59:54] wise what sort of person would take the
[13:59:56] all devouring narwhal as a pet I have to
[14:00:00] agree it's a strange use of a planet's
[14:00:03] primordial Waters just to raise an all
[14:00:05] devouring
[14:00:07] narwhal that kind of power is wasted on
[14:00:09] it it's not Cooperative it eats too much
[14:00:12] and I have more important things to do
[14:00:16] the only thing that creature has going
[14:00:18] for it is its looks all in all it fails
[14:00:21] as a pet hey if you need a new pet Miss
[14:00:25] skk I'm sorry I think you might have
[14:00:27] missed the point the point being well
[14:00:32] being that this pet almost destroyed an
[14:00:34] entire
[14:00:37] nation so what sort of person is your
[14:00:39] master those legs are sick child's
[14:00:42] Master's master
[14:00:44] wait is that right if she is like a
[14:00:46] different element like [ __ ] Quantum
[14:00:48] imaginary void whatever whatever that
[14:00:50] element is that's the best element
[14:00:51] that's my favorite element whatever it
[14:00:52] is it's like imagine they make it Geo
[14:00:54] imagine the only reaction you could do
[14:00:56] is avoid crystallize I'm going to shut

[14:03:24] such roing Hydro energies will prove
[14:03:27] difficult for the planet's deep seas to
[14:03:29] digest as such the Fontaine back on the
[14:03:32] surface has most likely been thrown into
[14:03:34] chaos and the prophecy that you've been
[14:03:38] fretting over should not swing
[14:03:42] what no there's little to be surprised

[14:03:49] this and accepted
[14:03:51] it
[14:03:53] however not to worry falor has already
[14:03:58] managed to deceive the Heavenly
[14:04:02] principles that's true actually pooris

[14:04:08] dissolved into the waters why you doing
[14:04:10] this to me and only finina will remain

[14:16:57] appear beside that of Mr juer Sir please
[14:17:00] don't say things like that but it looks

[14:17:11] just this this is my first time being

[14:17:27] genius Vibe going on the boat that
[14:17:29] brought about he doesn't sound like me
[14:17:32] the people while you app like an
[14:17:35] emissary of Legend still if I might ask
[14:17:39] where's that flying ship
[14:17:41] now looks like Charlotte's trying to get
[14:17:44] herself another exclusive scoop I have
[14:17:47] to apologize but that ship is presently
[14:17:50] in the bowels of our Factory I'm afraid
[14:17:52] it won't be easy for you to get a shot
[14:17:54] of it really well then in that case
[14:17:58] could I have an interview with you to
[14:17:59] make up for that

[14:19:00] Fortress same old same old as you can

[14:19:07] same other than that flying ship I got a
[14:19:11] other than that
[14:19:13] ship that's why I decided to let the
[14:19:15] interview go through we should direct
[14:19:17] more public opinions toward the behind
[14:19:19] the scenes Heroes am I right Mr jerrier

[14:21:54] do with us anyway true what does that
[14:21:57] have to do with
[14:22:05] us CH what if we made an account where
[14:22:07] we can use way points and then every

[14:24:45] happy to help oh I guess you haven't
[14:24:48] heard well after lady finina left father
[14:24:53] and Miss nervet opened negotiations
[14:24:55] during which he gave fontaine's nosis to
[14:24:58] her as a diplomatic
[14:25:01] gift are you [ __ ] kidding me are you
[14:25:05] [ __ ]
[14:25:06] joking Nita gave the té two and then
[14:25:10] nevet gives arino one what the [ __ ] am I
[14:25:14] going to do when I have to fight all the
[14:25:16] [ __ ] fouille harbingers okay what
[14:25:18] it's not going to be their battle it's
[14:25:20] not going to be Nita's fight it's not

[14:25:23] going to be mine I'm going to have to
[14:25:25] fight
[14:25:25] them yes I was quite surprised at first
[14:25:29] myself but when I thought it over there
[14:25:32] were actually a number of things going
[14:25:33] for
[14:25:34] it if arino asked me for anything I
[14:25:37] would do it yeah me too actually you're
[14:25:39] right Bas n it be done as an apology for
[14:25:41] the in with Lord child or as thanks for
[14:25:44] his help in tying the all devouring
[14:25:46] narwhal Town yeah I mean he did help
[14:25:47] with the Narwhal but then give it the
[14:25:49] child also lend significant to Fon like
[14:25:51] you don't even care about child she was
[14:25:53] like oh yeah
[14:25:54] him that's true but this is a nosis
[14:25:58] we're talking about doesn't this seem a
[14:26:00] bit
[14:26:02] irresponsible I would agree but I've
[14:26:05] also heard that it seems that M imagine
[14:26:09] AR was like the sky is fake and I was
[14:26:12] like take the sorry let's keep going so
[14:26:16] there's some reason for this that only
[14:26:18] nervet knows about I suspect you'll have
[14:26:21] to ask him about that yourself H yes
[14:26:25] speaking of which I did see him
[14:26:27] strolling around the entrance to the
[14:26:28] Fortress of meped a while back uh isn't
[14:26:32] he real busy and stuff time I didn't
[14:26:34] think he'd but back to the topic the
[14:26:37] nosis was given to the Nave right what
[14:26:39] about child they say that he's returned
[14:26:42] to snia to recover from his wounds I
[14:26:45] hear disaster really did a number on his
[14:26:49] health I guess I can call one of my War
[14:26:50] budies that's true when you think about
[14:26:52] it we've had loads of runin with the
[14:26:54] foule to think we'd be allied with them
[14:26:57] this time so shocked by such a simple
[14:27:01] switching of
[14:27:04] sides thought those AR likein know oh it
[14:27:06] is okay I was like I did I hey that
[14:27:08] voice I was like I heard that
[14:27:10] before hey well well what do you know

[14:27:16] are doing and meet the traveler by
[14:27:18] chance hello father please do not pay my

[14:27:41] place or person person but the entire
[14:27:43] world with such a grand goal in mind it
[14:27:46] is inevitable that we must wear many
[14:27:49] masks switching she speaks like a

[14:27:53] done she's got a
[14:27:55] Down Will you keep to your position well

[14:31:19] [Music]
[14:31:21] am hey nevet honored to meet you
[14:31:26] again so you really are here net kind of
[14:31:29] didn't think you were going to have free
[14:31:30] time this hour of the
[14:31:32] day
[14:31:34] really oh I suppose you must have met Mr
[14:31:37] Linny he took the time to greet me
[14:31:39] earlier when he passed this way in any
[14:31:42] case you came at a good time I was just
[14:31:44] considering reaching out to you to set
[14:31:46] up a meeting so I may explain some
[14:31:48] things that I haven't had the time to
[14:31:49] before A's glad that you remembered all
[14:31:53] right let's have it then how is Fontaine
[14:31:56] actually saved this part of the archon
[14:31:58] quest a mystery to us at least never
[14:32:00] that explains it to
[14:32:02] us it is strange how words can often
[14:32:05] leave a bitter taste in the mouth when
[14:32:06] it finally comes time to say them out
[14:32:10] loud
[14:32:19] s who so that's what
[14:32:23] happened FAL Lord destroyed the Divine
[14:32:26] Throne of the hyro archon and restored
[14:32:29] your power to you transforming you into
[14:32:31] a fully fledged Elemental Dragon
[14:32:34] Sovereign but pman still doesn't quite
[14:32:36] get what you did to save the fontans
[14:32:39] from dissolving for me the authority of
[14:32:42] the ancient dragons refers to absolute
[14:32:44] control over the hydro element fontans
[14:32:47] were incomplete humans born of aia's use
[14:32:50] of the power of the primordial sea with
[14:32:52] constitutions similar to that of mimics
[14:32:55] but so long as those primordial energies
[14:32:57] remain within them I could use the
[14:33:00] ancient dragon's authority to grant them
[14:33:02] True Blood after the fashion in which
[14:33:05] life was first brought into being on
[14:33:06] this planet in other words when I gave
[14:33:09] my verdict Fontan became true humans and
[14:33:13] thus he literally performed human
[14:33:15] Alchemy by water from the primordial sea
[14:33:17] for what could equal the value of a
[14:33:19] human soul that decision as well your
[14:33:22] verdict was the key to making the
[14:33:24] prophecy appear to have come true while
[14:33:26] saving everyone
[14:33:29] transmutation you could say it was at
[14:33:30] that moment that the fontans were
[14:33:32] finally truly born yeah and in a manner
[14:33:34] of speaking F finally managed to fulfill
[14:33:37] the original Hydro aran's wish to turn
[14:33:40] oan into real
[14:33:42] people it seems from your Expressions
[14:33:45] that you still have more things you wish
[14:33:46] to ask ask away I will tell you the
[14:33:49] truth as I know
[14:33:50] it about the initial verdict that was
[14:33:53] passed on chill day I have investigated
[14:33:55] his case along many Avenues and I have
[14:33:57] learned that he once fell into an
[14:33:59] unknown Chasm when he was young there by
[14:34:02] chance he awakened the all devouring
[14:34:04] narwhal but whether it be by sentiment
[14:34:06] or reason that should not have been
[14:34:08] enough to consider him the root cause of
[14:34:10] the disaster at most he would have had
[14:34:12] tangential liability as for the Judgment
[14:34:15] passed by the orrice during the trial
[14:34:18] whether it was due to that liability by
[14:34:20] association or falor deliberately using
[14:34:23] him to buy time for us on the assumption
[14:34:25] that he would be able to hold the
[14:34:27] creature off I cannot say guess falor
[14:34:30] had fontans in mind the whole time in
[14:34:33] the end it was thanks to her that they
[14:34:34] finally became real humans H hang on a
[14:34:37] second pman suddenly got another
[14:34:39] question back when Fontan hadn't yet
[14:34:41] become real humans were the children
[14:34:44] they had also transformed oan life has
[14:34:47] always flowed like water do you recall
[14:34:50] how fontans would often come to the
[14:34:52] Fountain of Lucine to pray for children
[14:34:55] no I just got here I literally arrived
[14:34:56] in font like a week all the waters in
[14:34:58] font converge in truth even those
[14:35:02] couples did not know that such prayers
[14:35:03] were no mere custom instead a form of
[14:35:06] ritual those oids who were blessed
[14:35:09] within the spring waterer would later
[14:35:10] descend as new humans in the coming
[14:35:13] months uh Pon sort of gets it
[14:35:18] now music so goofy be of any further use
[14:35:22] but it'll probably live on as a local
[14:35:24] custom ask away I will tell you the
[14:35:27] truth as I know it fontan's future yeah
[14:35:30] about that rley said finina has already
[14:35:33] left fin left what's that all about did
[14:35:36] I not listen to rizley man I'm tired the
[14:35:38] people are only aware that her death
[14:35:39] sentence has not been carried out
[14:35:41] she abdicated the post of hydro Aron and
[14:35:44] left Affairs related to that title to me
[14:35:46] before leaving the opera house I related
[14:35:49] fur's words to her faithfully and
[14:35:51] completely after hearing them she seemed
[14:35:53] neither saddened nor comforted she
[14:35:56] simply said that she was tired and
[14:35:58] needed to rest said that she then packed
[14:36:01] her things and moved out of the Opera
[14:36:02] House not unlike how an ordinary person
[14:36:05] might um but she still got a place to
[14:36:09] stay right
[14:36:11] you need not worry I will make
[14:36:13] arrangements to ensure that she will not
[14:36:14] want for food clothing board or travel
[14:36:17] in truth I am somewhat happy for her the
[14:36:21] wear and tear on her spirit will of
[14:36:22] course take time to heal but now that
[14:36:25] she no longer has to play the role of
[14:36:27] falor the hydro archon she can finally
[14:36:30] lay down her burdens and lead a normal
[14:36:32] life what about you then what are your
[14:36:35] plans now that you've regained your full
[14:36:37] Powers as the Hydro Dragon after falor
[14:36:40] passed on the orri also ceased to
[14:36:42] function this matter will directly
[14:36:44] affect our trials after much careful
[14:36:47] consideration I've decided to take over
[14:36:49] its role in our courts from now on I
[14:36:52] shall hear cases and pass verdicts by
[14:36:54] myself looks like you're still
[14:36:56] considering stuff from the perspective
[14:36:58] of the udex huh as an Elemental Dragon
[14:37:01] there are indeed many things that I must
[14:37:03] do but this power and this Duty in a
[14:37:07] manner of speaking you could say that
[14:37:08] both were granted to me as such before I
[14:37:11] attend to my other responsibilities I
[14:37:14] must first and foremost continue to
[14:37:16] serve Fontaine as its highest judge the
[14:37:18] duty of the hydro Sovereign and the duty
[14:37:20] of the udex shall coexist within my
[14:37:23] person Additionally the hydro archon's
[14:37:25] departure has brought about another
[14:37:27] problem which is that the opera house
[14:37:29] shall no longer produce indem nidum
[14:37:32] that's true that power was derived from
[14:37:34] the people's faith in the hydro Aron
[14:37:36] wasn't it wait but the various Mex and
[14:37:38] machines in the city are he like Al but
[14:37:41] also a dragon are they getting their
[14:37:42] energy from so I didn't pull from I told
[14:37:45] you full command of AIA this character
[14:37:48] is insane complete substitute another
[14:37:51] reason why I cannot quite leave on so
[14:37:53] I'll probably back in like [ __ ] two
[14:37:54] three patches this anent dragon's
[14:37:57] Authority stuff is really quite useful
[14:37:59] huh ask away I will tell you the truth
[14:38:02] as I know
[14:38:03] it lost my 50-50 what do you want me to
[14:38:06] do do you try winning the 50/50 about
[14:38:08] the noos yeah actually where did your
[14:38:10] nosis go
[14:38:11] oh that's right they say you've given it
[14:38:13] to the na as a leaving aside their
[14:38:15] intentionality the two fatou harbingers
[14:38:17] have indeed done much for us during this
[14:38:19] you better have a good explanation you
[14:38:21] better have a good explanation do you
[14:38:22] know who else did a lot for us do you
[14:38:23] know who else did a lot for us me sorry
[14:38:27] the solar remaining Goen font at least
[14:38:29] at this point would seem to be the nois
[14:38:31] the orrice has ceased to function the
[14:38:33] hydro archon's Divine Throne is now no
[14:38:35] more and I do not need the nois is power
[14:38:39] yeah you know who does need it it the
[14:38:41] [ __ ] fouille
[14:38:43] harbingers the [ __ ] main villains bro
[14:38:46] the
[14:38:47] why as such it has lost all meaning for
[14:38:50] Fontaine if the fatui have impure
[14:38:52] designs we might as well acceed to their
[14:38:55] request now and avoid unnecessary
[14:38:59] conflict what complicated considerations
[14:39:02] pman thought you were just giving it to
[14:39:04] why are you guys trying to convince me

[14:39:07] side with the fouille I would you think
[14:39:09] I care they're [ __ ] cooler than
[14:39:10] anyone else I would side with them I'm
[14:39:12] just saying we literally had to give up
[14:39:15] two for dor to stop [ __ ] murdering

[14:39:23] okay ask away I will tell you the truth
[14:39:26] as I know
[14:39:29] it that's not what he did

[14:39:37] Tor about the next step on my journey

[14:39:49] travel guide what do you mean tell you
[14:39:52] this region just came
[14:39:54] out as far as I'm aware naton can be
[14:39:57] said to be a nation of dragons a nation
[14:40:01] of dragons you mean like you no I
[14:40:05] suspect that I would not find myself
[14:40:07] welcomed there wait why unlike ancient
[14:40:09] dragons such as myself
[14:40:11] the dragons of naton have undergone long
[14:40:13] years of development and evolution wait
[14:40:15] that's sick of them have entered a form
[14:40:17] of coexistence with humanity naton is
[14:40:20] also the nation of war war ravages those
[14:40:24] lands like an undying flame there is one
[14:40:27] other piece of information I got
[14:40:28] incidentally from my negotiations with
[14:40:30] the Nave that I believe may be useful to
[14:40:32] you the harbinger known as the captain
[14:40:35] has thrown his hat into the endless Ring
[14:40:37] Of War yes
[14:40:39] C sounds like a real tough customer
[14:40:43] seriously everywhere you look there's a
[14:40:44] ftil Harbinger doing their thing I
[14:40:48] suggest that you fully prepare yourself
[14:40:50] before going to naton in the
[14:40:52] meantime doors will always be open to
[14:40:57] you ask away I will tell you the truth
[14:41:00] as I know wait there's no way that's the
[14:41:02] end of [ __ ] Fontan surely we get more

[14:41:07] point2 the [ __ ] Sur get more Carri bar
[14:41:10] is like yeah it does do an interlude D
[14:41:13] Leaf an interlude oh I see okay I think

[14:41:18] not in English is if D's Leaf's a main
[14:41:20] part I might put it Japanese just cuz I
[14:41:24] I'm sorry I I

[14:41:40] respectfully y about the next step on my
[14:41:42] journey you'll soon be heading to Natan
[14:41:44] I
[14:41:45] presume I'm afraid that I have little
[14:41:47] Talent as a travel guide I already I
[14:41:49] already talked about this aware a nation
[14:41:51] of dragon question mark bro listen to
[14:41:55] him unlike ancient dragons such as
[14:41:57] myself the dragons of naton have
[14:42:00] undergone long years of development and
[14:42:02] evolution large numbers of them have
[14:42:04] entered a form of
[14:42:09] coexist
[14:42:12] it's loading okay well my video is not
[14:42:14] working anymore well whatever never
[14:42:17] [Music]
[14:42:24] mind any naton is Al there is one other
[14:42:28] The Harbinger known as the I suggest
[14:42:30] that
[14:42:31] you I will tell you the truth as I
[14:42:34] know nice internet boo so regarding this
[14:42:39] I didn't know I ready to share something
[14:42:41] with you uh what is it in truth I
[14:42:45] exchanged some further words with that
[14:42:47] lady named skirk after sending you two
[14:42:49] back to the surface it went something
[14:42:51] like
[14:43:06] [Music]
[14:43:09] this to see what's going on you hurry
[14:43:12] over soon as well all right
[14:43:17] nervet same one
[14:43:20] animation what next this entire Quest
[14:43:23] he's just
[14:43:25] been the all devouring narwhal isn't
[14:43:28] here so I'm no longer getting any
[14:43:32] interference I can finally catch the
[14:43:35] scent of your power what it's made of it
[14:43:38] is the authority of the planet's
[14:43:40] primordial dragons he soall something
[14:43:43] very similar to a God's curse mixed in
[14:43:46] it's quite a novel blend I'm sure I've
[14:43:49] encountered something like this
[14:43:51] before what was it again I do not know
[14:43:55] what you speak
[14:43:57] of of course how could I forget you
[14:44:01] should have the remains of the Third
[14:44:02] descender on your person yes remains
[14:44:06] I've never heard of any such
[14:44:09] thing
[14:44:11] huh according to your parlance I believe
[14:44:14] it may be called a
[14:44:16] nosis well that much is true after fal's
[14:44:20] Divinity faded she handed her nosis to
[14:44:22] me but I fear I have never heard of it
[14:44:24] described in the manner that you just
[14:44:26] did I've been training with my master F
[14:44:29] ever since I was young and I have never
[14:44:32] returned to the surface since so most of
[14:44:35] the information I possess I got from him
[14:44:38] it is only natural for those who to are
[14:44:40] greater than Humanity to possess a
[14:44:42] different sort of Common Sense which is
[14:44:45] why there are so many problems in our
[14:44:47] attempts to communicate with humans
[14:44:50] regardless you should probably get rid
[14:44:52] of objects of Misfortune to prevent any
[14:44:55] disasters from befalling you to live in
[14:44:58] itself is a blessing but once a person
[14:45:01] dies the bonds he once had with this
[14:45:04] world shall all turn to curses what do
[14:45:07] you mean by
[14:45:08] that no need to threat these are just
[14:45:12] my personal
[14:45:14] thoughts she has the ha for no longer
[14:45:17] wishing to return to the surface this
[14:45:19] third descender you refer to who are
[14:45:22] they it's the when they die did they die
[14:45:25] turns into curses Master never mentioned
[14:45:28] them but then they she just called The
[14:45:29] Vision a [ __ ] what was it she called
[14:45:31] it a remnant of if you die and it leaves
[14:45:34] a curse but you die and it leaves a
[14:45:36] vision not Vision sorry noi do that mean
[14:45:38] that's a curse no
[14:45:41] okay if you're interested though I could
[14:45:44] ask him I'll be sure to pass the answer
[14:45:46] on to you next time next time you
[14:45:50] believe we will meet again nois not Noki
[14:45:52] my bad I
[14:45:54] do wait I have a disciple of my own
[14:45:58] don't I he can be the messenger
[14:46:03] then wait was I not wait he they
[14:46:06] literally said that
[14:46:09] though
[14:46:13] that's what she told me whether it would
[14:46:15] prove useful or not I wanted to pass
[14:46:18] from the third descender I see okay the
[14:46:20] remains of I know what that means
[14:46:22] descender so that's what the no okay I
[14:46:26] feel listen Pon Recaps things in case
[14:46:28] you're a dumbass and you don't pay
[14:46:30] attention and Pon just expl all the same
[14:46:34] assuming that there was no misunder
[14:46:36] understanding whenever that is what she
[14:46:39] meant to say whenever Pon says something
[14:46:41] and I learn from it I'm like [ __ ] I'm
[14:46:44] I'm dumb and this time my bad well
[14:46:46] thanks pon pon was made for me I guess
[14:46:49] said that it would bring Misfortune and
[14:46:50] that you should this is like the one
[14:46:52] time though usually I'm
[14:46:54] good if she speaks the truth then I
[14:46:57] would simply be putting Fontaine at
[14:46:59] unnecessary Risk by keeping it
[14:47:02] here desender she mentioned one of
[14:47:05] them I am the fourth
[14:47:07] descender for me this information means
[14:47:10] two
[14:47:11] things
[14:47:13] uh-oh one that the noses are related to
[14:47:16] the descenders two the ones who came
[14:47:19] before me sorry the one who came before
[14:47:21] me already died I guess that you might
[14:47:23] already be familiar with this concept
[14:47:25] but I did not expect you to be one of
[14:47:29] them that means that the nois which are
[14:47:31] exceedingly element compatible and can
[14:47:33] even enhance Elemental abilities do
[14:47:36] indeed come from the Third
[14:47:39] descender
[14:47:41] h i wonder does your body also possess
[14:47:44] similar
[14:47:46] properties no like uh like being able to
[14:47:51] use elemental powers without a vision
[14:47:53] that does sort of count as special
[14:47:55] compatibility right no no let's not
[14:47:58] think about this stuff right now it just
[14:48:00] a never we can find out sorry comparing
[14:48:03] the traveler to the dead third descender
[14:48:06] and all don't worry I won't die that's
[14:48:07] what you say but this topic still feels
[14:48:09] like
[14:48:10] luck once child recovers let's get some
[14:48:13] more answers out of him or go look for
[14:48:15] his master and get the answers that way
[14:48:18] I too believe it unwise to make too many
[14:48:20] blind guesses when information is
[14:48:22] lacking the same is true of being at
[14:48:24] court all right whatever the case it
[14:48:27] seems like the crisis here in fontaine's
[14:48:29] over for now yes all the falor efforts
[14:48:34] were for this moment as well but she
[14:48:37] sacrificed herself in the end as a god
[14:48:40] and she suffered through all those years
[14:48:42] as a human was that really what she
[14:48:45] wanted I suppose that would be the
[14:48:47] mystery of a God's will can you
[14:48:49] understand the will of the Gods supect
[14:48:51] Not but once in a while I too would
[14:48:53] guess that if wishes were like the
[14:48:55] clouds in the sky they will one day
[14:48:57] return to the Earth as
[14:48:59] raindrops life flows like water and the
[14:49:03] fin like the water May sometimes tilt
[14:49:06] one way or another but Falls fairly on
[14:49:10] all and what ultimately is the
[14:49:13] difference between the rains that fall
[14:49:15] upon all of
[14:49:19] us wait we [ __ ] did it hey we did it
[14:49:23] Mark your [ __ ] calendars cuz we did
[14:49:27] it can I get a lament nope I can't wait
[14:49:30] wait wait wait before we okay I need to
[14:49:32] get something straight I need to get
[14:49:33] something straight when when nevet gave
[14:49:34] the nosis to [ __ ] arino you guys like
[14:49:36] oh he'll explain it did I if I miss
[14:49:38] something say I miss something something
[14:49:40] but didn't he literally just say it was
[14:49:42] a [ __ ] like it was like a gift for
[14:49:44] her helping us and [ __ ] bro get her a
[14:49:46] box of
[14:49:47] chocolates no a 1,500 bits hopeful what

[14:49:53] I didn't watch it oh wait no I did not
[14:49:55] see this never mind I don't know what
[14:49:56] this is you it away because it's an
[14:49:58] object of
[14:49:59] Misfortune truth as I know you're right

[14:50:03] I'm tired okay it didn't say there the
[14:50:05] other one okay fair was one skir was

[14:50:22] to be uploaded anywhere if it is

[14:50:26] understanding some of the I was keeping
[14:50:28] up until like 5:00 a.m. then I got tired
[14:50:30] it's only been like 40 minutes of me
[14:50:32] being tired outside of that I was pretty
[14:50:33] cracked okay also trying to think what I
[14:50:36] rate the quest I mean that was pretty
[14:50:37] Peak I yeah I mean there wasn't really
[14:50:39] really a single part I didn't like

[14:51:16] I'm just a
[14:51:19] little I like Fino Dam I miss her wait

[14:51:24] Quest proceed you have to do Act five to
[14:51:26] do a story Quest right so like it's in
[14:51:28] sequ in sequestrant to it um Fin's okay

[14:51:41] like I didn't actually mean it okay
[14:51:42] please don't do that for the record two
[14:51:45] yesterday okay we'll do that nille that
[14:51:48] one's good too we'll probably do that as
[14:51:50] well wait so Chad wait wait I have a
[14:51:52] question before we I have a question so
[14:51:53] did we just confirm that finina is
[14:51:56] exactly as much the hydro archon as
[14:52:00] kakomi is
[14:52:03] hey
[14:52:05] true all along okay not really but you
[14:52:08] know what I mean I mean yeah actually
[14:52:10] yeah all along I knew it kind of listen
[14:52:13] to other archons about
[14:52:15] finina venting my
[14:52:19] goat a Bard must be versed in both music
[14:52:23] and song but a stage performer requires
[14:52:26] far more skills than just these hey
[14:52:29] don't you think we should invite her
[14:52:30] over to put on a show at the next wind
[14:52:32] Bloom
[14:52:33] Festival huh you want me to talk about
[14:52:36] how she saved
[14:52:37] Fontaine well I mean I mean she's such a
[14:52:40] talented artiste it's no wonder I
[14:52:43] wouldn't be surprised even if she'd
[14:52:45] saved the entire world Dum
[14:52:49] true yeah finina coming to wind Bloom
[14:52:51] would be sick imagine venty invites her
[14:52:53] she pulls up finina she made a contract
[14:52:55] with her own self to stop talking about
[14:52:57] Contra strictly adhered to it for over
[14:52:59] five centuries without once wavering and
[14:53:02] even fooled the Heavenly principles in
[14:53:04] the
[14:53:05] end I have great respect for approaches
[14:53:08] to Justice that place exacting demands
[14:53:11] not only on others but also on the self
[14:53:15] though her Divinity is vanished and the
[14:53:17] Throne of the archon is no more finina
[14:53:20] will go down in fontaine's history as a
[14:53:23] God of Justice worthy of recognition
[14:53:25] true so true J Le for five centuries I
[14:53:30] dueled the ride and Shogun in my
[14:53:32] personal Realm Of Consciousness to
[14:53:34] confirm the steadfastness of my
[14:53:37] will yet this forina used to speak of
[14:53:40] though possessing only a frail human
[14:53:42] body committed herself to acting out her
[14:53:45] part every second of every day for 500
[14:53:49] years yo the glazing is actually crazy
[14:53:53] her willpower has in bro why isn't she
[14:53:56] glazing everyone else who's been
[14:53:57] suffering for [ __ ] decade not decades
[14:54:00] centuries I mean true though finina did
[14:54:03] do
[14:54:04] that where's wrong
[14:54:07] Le Jonathan
[14:54:10] what do you think Jonathan
[14:54:14] Lee the first thing she said when she
[14:54:16] saw me was nice palace when he finally
[14:54:19] achieved the ambition he thought he'd
[14:54:21] been pursuing people often say that
[14:54:23] wisdom isn't about what you know but
[14:54:25] knowing what you can change it is beyond
[14:54:28] question that the prophecy was carved
[14:54:30] into man so long ago and while it me
[14:54:33] look like nothing has changed it also
[14:54:36] seems like everything has I think we we
[14:54:39] both know her to be smart enough to turn
[14:54:41] the fate of the world around about the
[14:54:44] Nave the the
[14:54:47] Nave who's she's a yo she's
[14:54:53] panicking died already forgotten about
[14:54:56] her s keeping such a terrible figure
[14:55:00] like her in your mind will only give you
[14:55:03] nightmares
[14:55:07] s I'm very confident in my singing
[14:55:10] skills but there aren't many pieces of
[14:55:13] music that are worthy of my vocal
[14:55:18] prowess she's a very strong person
[14:55:23] strong people will always manage to keep
[14:55:25] themselves have you tried nav's macarons
[14:55:28] I'm very grateful of course I
[14:55:32] I as I someone uh you're uh if you have
[14:55:38] time people people love talking about
[14:55:40] the past and often regret the beautiful
[14:55:43] things that have now faded
[14:55:45] into I didn't know you cared so much
[14:55:48] about me I
[14:55:51] do I'm really to happy
[14:55:59] birthday I haven't communicated with him
[14:56:03] have you tried nav's oh sh my others are
[14:56:05] muted my to admit that her skills in Des
[14:56:08] mon
[14:56:10] mine the design she paints on the
[14:56:12] macarons is so cute don't you think not
[14:56:15] to mention the texture and
[14:56:19] sweetness I really like the lumit those
[14:56:23] creatures shine and even places when
[14:56:27] okay fair enough now the curtain has
[14:56:29] finally fallen on her
[14:56:30] performance the character she portrayed
[14:56:33] was an imaginary one yet in playing that
[14:56:35] role she fulfilled her
[14:56:37] duties though she is is Meek and full of
[14:56:40] Doubt by Nature she was able to use
[14:56:42] Madness to stiffen her resolve and see
[14:56:45] her Duty through to its
[14:56:47] conclusion the work that she has done
[14:56:49] over the centuries is truly
[14:56:53] immense if she were to ever make a
[14:56:55] return to the stage I should personally
[14:56:57] attend the performance and give her my
[14:57:00] heartfelt
[14:57:01] Applause yes I must do so when the
[14:57:04] opportunity arises though the day will
[14:57:07] come when I put her on trial
[14:57:09] I must commend the god of virger on her
[14:57:12] sense of
[14:57:13] responsibility few things are without
[14:57:15] flaws in this world but the devotion and
[14:57:18] want to put on trial Testament to her
[14:57:21] commitment to continued progress bro she
[14:57:24] a kid I enormous regret when I learned
[14:57:26] of the mistreatment she has endured over
[14:57:27] the past 500 years I shall fulfill my
[14:57:30] vow to judge all of the seven in turn
[14:57:33] even if the sky should fall and the
[14:57:35] ground give way as the recipient of the
[14:57:38] authority of an Mo the god of Breeze and
[14:57:40] hope must also stand
[14:57:43] trial he spends most of his time being a
[14:57:47] harmless
[14:57:48] drunkard true well even so that's my
[14:57:52] goat that's why V dude that's why V's
[14:57:54] the best nothing will stop me from
[14:57:57] rendering judgment on each of the seven
[14:58:00] it's the archon who won the authority of
[14:58:02] Gio de Ori must be called to
[14:58:05] trial if one does not wish to see us on
[14:58:07] opposite sides of a conflict they need
[14:58:09] not worry for I intend to stay in
[14:58:12] Fontaine for the foreseeable future
[14:58:14] wants to just judge everyone well mean
[14:58:15] another 400
[14:58:17] years as another point of consolation
[14:58:19] even when the trial eventually takes
[14:58:21] place it is still not a given that the
[14:58:23] judgment will lead to a physical
[14:58:25] confrontation Dum what the [ __ ] they're
[14:58:27] trying to
[14:58:28] brawl shall f as a survivor of the
