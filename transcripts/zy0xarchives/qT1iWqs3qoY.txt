[00:09:24] now the right side of my hair where I
[00:09:26] laid in bed is like flat and it's
[00:09:28] tilting me to like I don't even care how
[00:09:30] I look I don't give a [ __ ] but it's just
[00:09:32] tilting me that it's like like that
[00:09:36] it's actually tilting me
[00:09:39] dude I'm tilted before I even enter the
[00:09:42] abyss
[00:09:44] also I'm gonna need someone's Crystal
[00:09:46] flies today
[00:09:47] flot is fine bro okay why do you make it
[00:09:50] about that I was okay yeah okay I I'm
[00:09:53] talking about hair I'm not talking about
[00:10:07] all right whatever it doesn't matter
[00:10:08] boom
[00:10:10] boom boom Frick you chat my hair's not
[00:10:13] working today don't talk about welcome
[00:10:14] to the stream hey I didn't see you there
[00:10:16] almost missed you
[00:10:24] why does my life fall apart when I miss
[00:10:26] your stream
[00:10:30] okay I'm gonna time you out just for you
[00:10:31] to like like one minute just for you to
[00:10:33] like
[00:10:34] maybe like have some self-reflection
[00:10:36] that's all welcome to the stream I
[00:10:38] missed you guys no I did it
[00:10:41] I did actually I actually like really
[00:10:43] want to stream but it's so hard because
[00:10:45] there's a lot of [ __ ] going on right now
[00:10:46] but I'm streaming again tomorrow I think
[00:10:48] so I'll expect yeah content
[00:10:51] um because my cousin one of my cousins
[00:10:53] haven't seen in Forever is like visiting
[00:10:54] so I want to stream before he gets here
[00:10:57] um and I have to do a gentian thing
[00:11:00] and I want to do a star rail thing so
[00:11:02] it's like tooth welcome to the stream
[00:11:04] whoa what's up I recorded a kazua
[00:11:07] pre-release video and I'll hide them
[00:11:09] we'll be out next but I didn't record
[00:11:10] that yet but I recorded casual so not
[00:11:13] pre-release that's a not what it's
[00:11:15] called Uh yeah thing
[00:11:19] tldr
[00:11:21] cause was really [ __ ] good but
[00:11:25] I think 10 minutes of the causal video
[00:11:27] is me talking about sucrose
[00:11:31] basically it's like yeah it's really
[00:11:33] good dendro kind of changed how good he
[00:11:36] is because some of your teams don't need
[00:11:37] Kaza
[00:11:38] so usually use them in the second team
[00:11:39] but then if that second team can use
[00:11:41] sucrose do you really is cause are
[00:11:42] really a must pull for your account yes
[00:11:44] for that team no does that make sense
[00:11:46] because a lot of people will be like oh
[00:11:47] if you play two dendro teams don't pull
[00:11:49] Coswell true that is the Jeff tank
[00:11:51] however that's not really what he would
[00:11:52] say but true but odds are in [ __ ] one
[00:11:55] year if you're still playing you
[00:11:56] probably are like oh [ __ ] I should add
[00:11:58] Cosmo so it's kind of like it's a
[00:12:00] slippery slope but in a year he'll
[00:12:01] probably get another rerun so yeah
[00:12:02] though anyways [ __ ] you sour water
[00:12:07] I'm kidding thanks for three months love
[00:12:09] Simon there's a six veronzo Panda takes
[00:12:11] a nine project guardian this before
[00:12:20] causes broken stop coping you stop
[00:12:22] coping suck my balls
[00:12:25] I never said he wasn't broken
[00:12:31] I don't think in my life okay two things
[00:12:33] one one I think him being the same
[00:12:35] Tierra sucrose doesn't doesn't mean he's
[00:12:38] bad I think that just means they're both
[00:12:39] broken but second thing is I've never
[00:12:41] met a Causeway regretter in my life ever
[00:12:43] literally ever not once and people
[00:12:44] attracted oh me no you're not you're
[00:12:46] literally not I've never met a single
[00:12:48] causal regretter so it's like I don't
[00:12:51] feel bad for hyping him but I also don't
[00:12:54] think he's like needed because you could
[00:12:56] just sucrose half the time but I still
[00:12:58] think it's really broken and his
[00:12:59] grouping's a lot better sucrose grouping
[00:13:01] is like trying to brush her teeth with
[00:13:02] with an orange it's counterproductive
[00:13:04] people are like oh I can group with
[00:13:05] sucrose no the [ __ ] you can't grow up
[00:13:07] literally grow up you can't you can't
[00:13:09] grow up grow up you can you get like
[00:13:10] displaced [ __ ] treasure hoarders sure
[00:13:16] but yeah Kazo is life-changing
[00:13:19] but sucrose a lot of times is about as
[00:13:22] good
[00:13:23] to wear the gems it cost to replace the
[00:13:26] girls for causal aren't worth it
[00:13:27] sometimes too gross is better
[00:13:30] um sometimes usually it's when you can
[00:13:32] use your own field there's like other
[00:13:33] situations like sometimes with child but
[00:13:36] the grouping can make up for it and
[00:13:38] sometimes and like aggravate stuff if
[00:13:39] we're like cocoon and sometimes in like
[00:13:42] usually it's on field like taser [ __ ]
[00:13:44] like on field
[00:13:46] yeah but cause so causal can also double
[00:13:49] swirl is just less easy because you need
[00:13:51] his burst
[00:13:53] but it's also and like you know you need
[00:13:55] like underlying pyro and his burst but
[00:13:57] the only thing that's easy like the
[00:13:58] thing that's better is he can group
[00:13:59] really well and then cause a child has
[00:14:01] Riptide so the more grouped enemies are
[00:14:04] the more riptide's gonna [ __ ] them up so
[00:14:07] can kind of make up for it so it's kind
[00:14:09] of like
[00:14:10] depends
[00:14:12] anyways welcome to the Stream I hope
[00:14:15] you're all doing well if you're not
[00:14:17] getting it back that's gonna make you
[00:14:19] feel better uh with that in mind let us

[00:21:01] I feel like I don't even talk that fast
[00:21:03] but okay he's definitely not he's I know
[00:21:07] this is going he's definitely not the
[00:21:08] type of streamer to disconnect their
[00:21:10] Wi-Fi thus causing the stream to end
[00:21:12] just because their browser wasn't
[00:21:13] working then realizing that the browser
[00:21:16] isn't working and using Opera GX to
[00:21:18] watch the CN version of the HSR 1.1
[00:21:21] stream
[00:21:22] yeah I'm glad okay that's fine
[00:21:25] dude listen it wasn't my setup it wasn't
[00:21:28] my house I figured hey the why okay so
[00:21:31] the Wi-Fi is not working because my
[00:21:33] twitch streams aren't working when I
[00:21:34] open a twitch stream it's not working so
[00:21:36] it can't be their fault has to be my
[00:21:38] fault so I reset the router and it turns
[00:21:40] out it was just Google Chrome [ __ ] me

[00:29:18] saying something true once a day until

[00:30:00] Auto attack I'm stupid I forgot what
[00:30:02] child was you eat to apply the hydro you
[00:30:04] bet at Q it doesn't remove the hydro
[00:30:05] Aura completely so when you swirl it
[00:30:07] hits hydro and then it infuses your
[00:30:09] burst with pyro because kazua the first
[00:30:11] hit Swirls and then the infusion is pyro
[00:30:13] I'm explaining it so people understand
[00:30:14] that I understand then after that you
[00:30:16] can swap to your other characters
[00:30:17] because you swirled both hydro and pyros
[00:30:20] if you go shangling and
[00:30:21] it's actually snapshotting the Pyro buff
[00:30:24] you just gave and then you could go

[00:36:14] proven to matter up to a certain amount
[00:36:17] or it increases your happiness I think

[00:38:21] stream and night Mr socks heart heart
[00:38:27] ah
[00:38:45] sorry I was chatting
[00:38:48] hey whoa
[00:38:49] whoa press one
[00:38:53] one two one one two if you love gentian
[00:39:00] my light just got super [ __ ] bright
[00:39:04] I I fixed it
[00:39:07] hey guys
[00:39:12] uh
[00:39:26] the Oxford comma did you actually thanks
[00:39:28] to the Dono do you guys know the Oxford
[00:39:30] comma is like when you add a comma
[00:39:32] before and when you're listing things
[00:39:33] and a company got into legal trouble
[00:39:35] because they didn't do that and it was
[00:39:36] misleading it's like it's actually
[00:39:38] really important to put a comma before
[00:39:40] and if you type multiple things and the
[00:39:41] reason it's called the extra comma is
[00:39:43] because Oxford students were like
[00:39:44] debating on if they should implement it
[00:39:46] or not and they chose to do you know why
[00:39:48] because actually I was at the meeting I
[00:39:51] said Hey listen Mr Oxford I think there
[00:39:53] should be a comma there because it could
[00:39:54] be misleading what if you're saying I
[00:39:56] want to farm [ __ ] Echoes Vermilion
[00:39:58] and emblem right and there's no comma
[00:40:01] you could think that Echoes and emblem
[00:40:03] are the same domain so for example for
[00:40:05] example for example let me use Fang as
[00:40:07] the example so let's say it's like the
[00:40:08] Vermillion
[00:40:10] Echoes and emblem and you don't comma
[00:40:13] versus Vermilion comma Echoes comma and
[00:40:17] emblem in this instance you can tell
[00:40:20] with the Oxford comma that Vermillion
[00:40:21] Echoes and mm are separate if you don't
[00:40:23] put a comma there which isn't
[00:40:24] quote-unquote needed because it's just a
[00:40:26] it's like
[00:40:28] if you will uh that's not the right word
[00:40:30] but you get me uh Vermillion Echoes and
[00:40:32] Emma here you could think uh a less
[00:40:34] educated read or Not educated but less
[00:40:36] experienced with getch impact reader
[00:40:38] could say hey are echoes and emblem
[00:40:40] together like are they one domain so
[00:40:42] that's why the Oxford comma is in place
[00:40:44] and because I participated in the
[00:40:46] meeting and helped implement it uh Mr
[00:40:48] Oxford himself John Oxford said ziox we
[00:40:51] love you so much let us let us name the
[00:40:54] dictionary in your honor and I said no I
[00:40:56] don't want a dictionary I don't want
[00:40:58] this we say hey at least let me give you
[00:41:00] something we have 1500 recipes in a
[00:41:02] stream to spend on the domain of our
[00:41:03] choice because of Jonathan Oxford so
[00:41:06] thank you John big shout out big fan uh
[00:41:09] and thanks to the donor reminding me
[00:41:10] about that
[00:41:15] anyways I need to kill this boss for
[00:41:18] um wait thanks online

[00:42:58] and the DPS difference is around 10
[00:43:00] percent

[00:44:00] have enough like I've never run out of
[00:44:02] fragments
[00:44:03] however I was also thinking I was
[00:44:05] thinking if I'm gonna be against the
[00:44:06] streamer for the foreseeable future
[00:44:08] there's no reason for me yo there is no
[00:44:12] reason for me to not go for level 90
[00:44:14] like almost every character or like at
[00:44:17] least Ascend all of my characters so I
[00:44:19] might have to start streaming like hey

[00:44:42] far is not ascended and I'm literally
[00:44:44] like she's friendship 10. like I [ __ ]
[00:44:46] like I've been playing her like every
[00:44:47] day since she came out and she's not
[00:44:49] even she's literally not even fully
[00:44:51] ascended
[00:44:52] and like I use her all the time you have
[00:44:55] been doing well for good artifacts today
[00:44:59] even Eloy I mean yeah why not
[00:45:03] good artifacts you'll see okay I
[00:45:05] actually have so much to do today
[00:45:06] I have so much to do today and I decided
[00:45:08] to do other [ __ ] so I'm behind you don't
[00:45:10] even understand how much I have to do
[00:45:11] okay listen listen let me explain listen
[00:45:14] it's what you say and listen

[00:45:23] Oxford gave to me allegedly
[00:45:25] uh don't have to spend
[00:45:28] I have to do three Abyss runs two
[00:45:30] minimum because I need Cosmo footage for
[00:45:32] my causal rerun video
[00:45:35] um
[00:45:36] and
[00:45:39] I need
[00:45:41] that's it but I'm also streaming I think
[00:45:42] tomorrow because we're doing a thing
[00:45:44] okay listen I'm gonna do a thing listen
[00:45:48] try spoil the idea I have
[00:45:51] [ __ ] it I'm gonna spoil the idea I have
[00:45:53] so I was gonna do a video before Fang
[00:45:55] disappears right I was like dude if
[00:45:57] she's here anyways I might as well do a
[00:45:59] video right so I was thinking of doing
[00:46:00] like
[00:46:01] basically like like like fix sneaker
[00:46:03] builds and then letting her do the new
[00:46:05] Abyss right but then I was like I feel
[00:46:06] like that would be that's not good
[00:46:08] enough content so what I'm doing instead
[00:46:10] I mean that would be good cut then but I
[00:46:11] don't know I decided I have a better
[00:46:12] idea what I'm gonna do instead is the
[00:46:15] video's gonna be called okay listen
[00:46:16] you're not ready what I'm gonna do
[00:46:20] instead of fixing her accounts Jokes
[00:46:23] Aside The Oxen inspired me to scam
[00:46:25] myself into his content that's not true
[00:46:28] I'm not a scammer but anyways instead of
[00:46:31] instead of uh instead of like fixing
[00:46:34] like making her do it on her account
[00:46:35] which is kind of sus I was thinking
[00:46:39] we're gonna let her use I'm gonna gear
[00:46:42] all of my characters then I'm gonna let
[00:46:43] her use my account my characters my
[00:46:46] weapons everything that's on my account
[00:46:48] and I've cleared this Abyss 17 million
[00:46:50] times and then let her play on it and
[00:46:52] anytime she dies I Temple and then the
[00:46:55] video will be called like if she dies I
[00:46:56] roll boom clickbait title good content
[00:47:00] dude it's literally win-win
[00:47:02] how much time for causal better on n a
[00:47:04] it's a day and a half on Asia's a date
[00:47:08] W yeah so I wanted to do that today but
[00:47:10] I think I'm doing it tomorrow
[00:47:19] what if she c6's Causeway okay she's not
[00:47:22] gonna die that much I have Jean Lee like
[00:47:24] she can just I'm not gonna help her that
[00:47:26] like I think I'll have a role like I'm
[00:47:28] gonna try not to like help too much but
[00:47:30] like dude unless she needs it but like
[00:47:32] dude like it's not that hard to not die

[00:49:51] like this is gonna end soon I don't want

[00:50:17] support team I don't know I don't
[00:50:19] actually know I don't know employment
[00:50:21] laws
[00:50:34] he did the Lego stop motion
[00:50:37] oh yeah dude
[00:50:38] I think he's the Jeff is watching right
[00:50:40] dude the Jeff laughed he was like dude
[00:50:42] when that scene okay he literally
[00:50:44] laughed so loud the people in front of
[00:50:46] us turned around like is that just dude
[00:50:50] yeah he was kind of talking caps lock or
[00:50:53] laughing accounts like
[00:50:59] yeah
[00:51:01] why am I exploring what the [ __ ] am I
[00:51:04] doing
[00:51:12] yeah I dropped my mouse yeah this is the
[00:51:14] nine months
[00:51:17] balls balls balls
[00:51:19] ooh
[00:51:21] balls
[00:51:24] during one scene the Lego one
[00:51:28] is it bad I teared up yes
[00:51:30] oh also I had to watch the first movie I
[00:51:32] didn't watch and I didn't I still didn't
[00:51:34] watch into the spider-verse I just
[00:51:35] launched across because I told zaj I was
[00:51:37] gonna watch into and then we watch
[00:51:38] across together me him and Fang and then
[00:51:41] I was like
[00:51:42] I my silver wolf Glide was delayed like
[00:51:44] two days and I was like so I was legit
[00:51:48] you don't understand I was like like
[00:51:50] video stream sleep repeat I didn't have
[00:51:53] a life so and I don't want to cancel on
[00:51:55] zaj I don't want to say like because a
[00:51:57] lot of times I'll be like tomorrow
[00:51:58] tomorrow and then I don't do anything so
[00:52:00] I felt bad if I was like not today so I
[00:52:02] was like [ __ ] it so I just I went to the
[00:52:04] movie and I uploaded after but I didn't
[00:52:06] watch the first one so it doesn't matter
[00:52:07] it doesn't matter like I got spoiled it
[00:52:09] within the first like 10 minutes but
[00:52:11] I'll still re-watch It Anyway this
[00:52:12] doesn't matter
[00:52:14] like it's not like it was hard to
[00:52:15] understand what was going on
[00:52:18] it didn't like there's it doesn't matter
[00:52:20] but like now I'm gonna watch the first
[00:52:22] one and I'm gonna know what's gonna
[00:52:23] happen which is unlucky but it's fine
[00:52:31] it was easy to follow yeah and then I
[00:52:33] watched a one piece movie with them and
[00:52:35] that one was like harder to follow
[00:52:37] because I didn't know any of the [ __ ]
[00:52:38] characters
[00:52:39] and then I had to figure out why every
[00:52:41] time like Nami was on screen her chest
[00:52:44] was jiggling rapidly I was like why did
[00:52:46] they draw her like that but then they're
[00:52:47] like
[00:52:48] yeah so it's all good
[00:52:52] question mark dude okay listen dude okay
[00:52:55] listen I don't know okay I this is
[00:52:58] someone who hasn't watched the show okay
[00:52:59] I have not watched the show so take this
[00:53:01] with a grain of salt but from my
[00:53:03] understanding this is how the characters
[00:53:05] are drawn okay those are the characters
[00:53:07] are drawn okay are you ready this is how
[00:53:09] the characters are drawn this is average
[00:53:10] one-piece character it's like
[00:53:16] wait okay those are that's not her
[00:53:18] that's like her that's like this and
[00:53:20] then it's like okay it's like listen
[00:53:22] it's like listen it's like so this is
[00:53:24] like her neck right and then arm okay
[00:53:26] and then like chest areas like here and
[00:53:28] then it's like arm and then like this is
[00:53:30] her torso and then this is like
[00:53:34] okay I can't draw
[00:53:37] all right it was like Circle and then
[00:53:39] like leg
[00:53:46] we can tell okay did you wait do you
[00:53:49] guys buy Japan drawing wait did I save
[00:53:50] it didn't save it wait
[00:53:54] wait where's my dripar drawing
[00:53:58] let me pull it up I sent it to Alan
[00:54:00] departure part departure part departure
[00:54:02] departure departure departure part
[00:54:08] I found it
[00:54:14] ciao what do you guys think about Japan
[00:54:15] drawing
[00:54:17] W or no
[00:54:18] right out of ten
[00:54:25] dude listen there's so many donated
[00:54:27] three dollars never mind I'm back I'm
[00:54:31] very excited to see the spider-verse
[00:54:33] movie and the Transformers one big
[00:54:35] transformers fan here from childhood
[00:54:37] prob not a good idea I hope you draw
[00:54:40] someone angry Ox what ate your opinions
[00:54:43] on space I really like space things
[00:54:47] what is my opinion on space
[00:54:55] I mean that's spacious
[00:54:58] child listen here's my take okay here's
[00:55:00] my take
[00:55:02] listen
[00:55:04] the assumption that every person has
[00:55:06] somewhere to call home is naive wait
[00:55:08] this makes him look short
[00:55:10] alongside the birds and beasts a long
[00:55:13] time ago
[00:55:15] there you go
[00:55:21] I'll put a w because it's not a real
[00:55:23] show
[00:55:24] here you go
[00:55:26] truly an artist
[00:55:28] dude this is my take okay there's so
[00:55:29] many if there's already dude listen
[00:55:31] there's already okay listen
[00:55:33] listen there's already so many like
[00:55:36] artists that are like
[00:55:38] super talented right so it's like I'm if
[00:55:41] I'm if I know that the amount of effort
[00:55:43] and time it would take me to become
[00:55:45] nearly like like nearly that good that
[00:55:49] would take like 10 years minimum okay I
[00:55:51] don't have that kind of time and and
[00:55:53] there's already so many so it's like I
[00:55:55] might as well distinguish Myself by
[00:55:56] being bad so it's like so like
[00:55:58] technically if you're bad enough it
[00:56:00] becomes good because like because like
[00:56:01] it's like a way to like distinguish
[00:56:03] yourself think about it
[00:56:05] think about it think about it
[00:56:07] so it's like
[00:56:09] if there's listen
[00:56:11] if there's listen if there's so much
[00:56:13] good you can stand out by being bad
[00:56:18] true
[00:56:21] also Shanghai
[00:56:34] is that the Strat you used for streaming
[00:56:37] was
[00:56:42] what does that mean
[00:56:45] what does that mean
[00:56:55] you can't mastering bad
[00:56:57] I mean I I agree you're I'm streaming
[00:56:59] behind a staircase with the worst
[00:57:01] lighting you've ever seen in my pajamas
[00:57:05] so yes
[00:57:16] it's actually the hardest job in the
[00:57:18] world so uh show some respect
[00:57:21] it's so hard I have to play a video game
[00:57:36] [Music]
[00:57:47] minus eight hello Mr sockson's chat
[00:57:51] [ __ ]
[00:57:59] you work very hard yes but that doesn't
[00:58:01] mean the job is hard does that make
[00:58:02] sense
[00:58:03] I work hard because I want to but that
[00:58:05] doesn't mean what I do is hard like I
[00:58:07] think I'm very privileged to be able to
[00:58:09] stream and stuff
[00:58:10] uh like I did this mostly as a hobby but
[00:58:12] to be able to do it like
[00:58:14] sustainably I think it's unprivileged
[00:58:16] but I also like I work hard because I
[00:58:18] want to because I think it's good but I
[00:58:21] don't think I need to like it's not like
[00:58:22] the job itself is hard I think it's a
[00:58:24] bit different
[00:58:30] well like it's not easy easy okay it's
[00:58:32] it's hard as a like if you're thinking
[00:58:35] of like job like there's so much [ __ ]
[00:58:36] that's like way way harder that I would
[00:58:38] never be able to do right like
[00:58:40] but it's like
[00:58:42] it's mentally taxing it's not like
[00:58:45] hard but it's mentally
[00:58:48] um mentally taxing very very much uh I
[00:58:52] have pretty strong mental and I don't
[00:58:53] really let anything get to me and I also
[00:58:55] I don't know how I did it like look this
[00:58:58] is why I'm kind of afraid so I feel like
[00:59:00] I feel like this can't last forever but
[00:59:02] I feel like
[00:59:04] at the point I'm at like
[00:59:06] I feel like I'm like
[00:59:09] you know on like I'm on most people's
[00:59:12] good side in the sense of like I don't
[00:59:14] know why anyone would like I don't know
[00:59:15] what the [ __ ] I would do that would
[00:59:16] upset people but I feel like every
[00:59:18] content creator ever has people that
[00:59:20] don't like them everyone literally
[00:59:22] everyone name any big streamer like
[00:59:24] anyone you can think of has a bunch of
[00:59:26] people that don't like them so it's like
[00:59:27] I'm trying to think like
[00:59:28] I'm like how does no one hate me yet but
[00:59:32] we'll see
[00:59:33] germa I guess no one hates germa that's
[00:59:35] true actually that's actually true I
[00:59:37] haven't met anyone who doesn't like
[00:59:38] germa that's actually true
[00:59:44] dumb
[00:59:47] also what the [ __ ] was this pin Nick
[00:59:49] listen Okay dropped I forgot about that
[00:59:53] wait one second yeah true I forgot this
[00:59:55] Crystal Palace here I knew it did I
[00:59:57] found these Crystal flies by accident
[00:59:58] and I knew I would forget about them so
[01:00:00] I wrote a pin because there's some in
[01:00:02] this rock and how the [ __ ] would I
[01:00:03] remember that there's some in the Rock
[01:00:05] so I had to write a pin
[01:00:07] I assume they respawned I don't actually
[01:00:09] know but I assume they would because
[01:00:11] Crystal flies usually respawn
[01:00:13] sneaky things
[01:00:17] nice
[01:00:18] I'm a genius still haven't replied to me
[01:00:20] last month if I can have your child
[01:00:24] uh no
[01:00:36] but yeah
[01:00:42] it is definitely mentally Taxi
[01:00:46] is a real name Nick yo yo why are you
[01:00:48] asking for my government are you the IRS
[01:00:50] what's happening devious scammer is this
[01:00:53] Nicholas I'm actually my job is very
[01:00:55] difficult pointing finger
[01:00:58] ziox is right about his work I have seen
[01:01:01] this shut the [ __ ] up
[01:01:03] the pressure or their own mistakes
[01:01:05] sometimes taking a step back and
[01:01:08] building a support system is helpful
[01:01:10] hard
[01:01:11] wait are you being okay I can't tell if
[01:01:13] you're trolling you're being serious
[01:01:20] foreign
[01:01:28] stressful and easier than being a lawyer
[01:01:30] uh okay I'm not a lawyer I'm half I'm
[01:01:32] one semester away from getting a law
[01:01:34] degree but then you have to do the bar
[01:01:35] exam which my brother did my brother's a
[01:01:37] lawyer I have to do I would need about
[01:01:40] either half a year to one year of school
[01:01:42] plus a bar a bar which is like two
[01:01:45] months three months of studying
[01:01:47] how about code what's up
[01:01:51] will you do it I don't know
[01:01:54] it
[01:01:56] huh
[01:02:08] two months straight of studying yes yes
[01:02:11] but
[01:02:13] I know my brother did it while playing
[01:02:15] DotA and
[01:02:17] he passed so
[01:02:20] uh surely it's surely it's surely it's
[01:02:23] doable
[01:02:25] it's really it's doable
[01:02:31] why is he collecting them off because I
[01:02:32] have 1500 resin okay we should start
[01:02:34] with the abyss because I [ __ ] hate it
[01:02:44] bro's halfway there and he doesn't know
[01:02:46] if he'll do it well I'm more than
[01:02:47] halfway there I have a year left but I
[01:02:49] just don't know if it's worth it
[01:02:51] because it's hard like okay
[01:02:53] I'm not gonna lie
[01:02:56] I was like really into it and really
[01:02:58] good like my grades are good
[01:03:04] and um you know I liked it add friends
[01:03:06] whatever but then it's like
[01:03:08] covet happened like second year right
[01:03:13] and that's like okay
[01:03:16] that sucks but then the Redemption Arc
[01:03:18] was I could do online classes while I
[01:03:20] started streaming because that's kind of
[01:03:21] when I started and then I was like that
[01:03:22] was easy it wasn't easy but it was like
[01:03:24] easier because I don't have to displace
[01:03:26] myself so I was like I could just do
[01:03:28] that while I do other [ __ ] and then
[01:03:29] record my classes and watch them later
[01:03:30] and then that was easy
[01:03:32] but then it's like
[01:03:33] I kind of part-timed it because I want
[01:03:35] to be able to also make videos and stuff
[01:03:37] and now it's like it's back to in person
[01:03:40] which is like if it was still online I
[01:03:43] could finish easy but since it's in
[01:03:45] person now I have to drive 45 minutes
[01:03:47] because I'm far from the University so
[01:03:49] it's 45 minutes there 45 minutes back
[01:03:51] then it's a whole day like drink I don't
[01:03:54] know if I could do it so I don't know
[01:03:56] I'd have to like part-time it I don't
[01:03:58] know yet we'll see
[01:04:00] helpful okay well okay that's not true I
[01:04:03] take the bus I'm serious because I guess
[01:04:05] I could pay for parking but that's just
[01:04:07] expense I don't want it the language
[01:04:08] I'll [ __ ] pay for parking even worse
[01:04:10] when already bad dude uni parking is
[01:04:12] like a scam like it's so expensive but I
[01:04:15] don't want to buy well I haven't checked

[01:04:56] it is I basically for me right now it's
[01:04:57] like a backup plan because it's like I'm
[01:04:59] doing this for fun so if it doesn't work

[01:13:29] when you realize you could have used
[01:13:30] reverse does that make sense yes or no I

[01:28:30] me like that's whatever
[01:28:35] should be fine
[01:28:38] why don't you activate your causal
[01:28:39] constellations because I didn't actually
[01:28:40] get them or pull for them what happened
[01:28:42] was I went to the washroom right after a
[01:28:43] long day I was like you know I just need
[01:28:45] to chill I want to take a shower a bath
[01:28:46] maybe and my cat uh yeah funny story ran
[01:28:50] onto my keyboard did one Temple and in
[01:28:53] that Temple literally like clicked on my
[01:28:55] [ __ ] Mouse pulled on the cause of
[01:28:57] header got six causes in one pool won
[01:29:00] every 50 50 and then I was like dude
[01:29:03] what the [ __ ] and I would actually show
[01:29:04] you guys in the history but uh my
[01:29:07] account got locked for suspicious
[01:29:08] activity because they're like how the
[01:29:09] [ __ ] do you get six and I was like dude
[01:29:10] I don't know so it was deleted from the
[01:29:12] history but it actually happened
[01:29:14] true I was the cat
[01:29:28] wait what if I wait what if I wait what
[01:29:33] wait
[01:29:35] what if I do slow dendro
[01:29:38] double Hydro because we're like mainly a
[01:29:41] vape team right but then mainly a vape
[01:29:44] team but they got a little bit of
[01:29:46] virgins mainly a vape team
[01:29:57] because the thing is okay let's say we
[01:29:59] do like nahida like like let's say we do
[01:30:01] this right you know what ends up
[01:30:02] happening eventually at some point or
[01:30:04] like yolan especially at some point it
[01:30:07] ends up being burning despair but what
[01:30:08] if we what if we what if we yeah yeah
[01:30:10] better listen we need the like tiny tiny
[01:30:13] Shield
[01:30:14] no no you guys aren't ready for this I'm
[01:30:16] actually doing it let me just make sure
[01:30:17] baiju's geared wow zox I love it when
[01:30:19] you check your artifacts [ __ ] you
[01:30:23] he's on oath sworn eye level one oh I
[01:30:26] I've pre-farmed for akagura's offstream
[01:30:28] by the way because we got it
[01:30:29] don't I don't remember how we got it I
[01:30:31] just know I got it off of some [ __ ]
[01:30:36] you get a reverse balloons that are
[01:30:37] inefficient I know but like okay listen
[01:30:39] every retroversion team is inefficient
[01:30:42] so I feel like that's like you have to
[01:30:44] pick one loss like you can't have all
[01:30:47] four characters being a win like there
[01:30:49] is a loss somewhere in there don't
[01:30:52] unless you're like because you can do
[01:30:54] kokomi but then if you do kokomi
[01:30:58] wait what did I clear with last time
[01:31:00] because I definitely played a dilute
[01:31:01] team
[01:31:07] I'm gonna try it [ __ ] it
[01:31:14] no this team is garbage no it's not
[01:31:16] garbage it's it's the secret meta if
[01:31:18] it's garbage explain the clear we're
[01:31:19] about to do if it's bad explain what
[01:31:21] you're about to see please I I challenge
[01:31:23] you I think optimal team is probably
[01:31:27] kokomi here if we need a shield you
[01:31:29] could probably uh c6ro and then Jonathan
[01:31:32] Lee and you might be able to like keep
[01:31:35] up but I feel like you won't keep up
[01:31:36] with this
[01:31:40] oh
[01:31:42] de Luke without Bennett um okay watch
[01:31:44] this then watch this then
[01:31:51] I mean
[01:32:04] cat what do you think what should I do I
[01:32:07] really want to try and baiju here I
[01:32:08] think it's gonna suck ass but I wanna
[01:32:11] try it because it's mainly a vape team
[01:32:13] it's mainly Vape
[01:32:20] yeah let's do it [ __ ] it I can't wait to
[01:32:22] die you guys are not ready for the first
[01:32:24] half like I know I'm saying this and
[01:32:26] you're like oh haha copium but you guys

[01:35:35] happening anymore
[01:35:38] okay I kind of threw I did listen
[01:35:41] it's not the team's fault I just
[01:35:42] couldn't get my [ __ ] dendro app off
[01:35:44] because I don't have enough VR and this
[01:35:46] guy can't do anything against non-dendro
[01:35:49] okay
[01:35:51] what's up
[01:35:53] okay
[01:35:55] I don't think it was the theme song I
[01:35:57] think I was okay
[01:36:03] mods there's someone who keeps saying do
[01:36:05] a Geo team clear please please ban them
[01:36:07] please please I will give you my salad I

[01:36:28] Singh Cho but this time nahira and then
[01:36:37] if I do baiju it's gonna become a
[01:36:39] burning team so we should probably do
[01:36:41] like
[01:36:43] kokomi but I'm down to zhangly too
[01:36:49] strongly or kokomi
[01:36:51] um

[01:37:36] I'm not getting so low I guess I added
[01:37:38] crit rate because they used to do 70ks
[01:37:41] probably change my builds

[01:55:37] I think you have a headphone Dent wait
[01:55:39] really
[01:55:42] no I don't actually don't
[01:55:54] wait you what the [ __ ] happened to my
[01:55:56] hair
[01:56:00] it gonna work
[01:56:08] [Music]
[01:56:13] with nature
[01:56:29] worthless I don't care
[01:56:37] how is he not dead
[01:56:40] he died to a [ __ ] gust of wind
[01:56:46] I thought I would have to dodge because
[01:56:48] he'd die
[01:56:49] all right whatever
[01:57:01] Adorn my Knights never
[01:57:05] again
[01:57:06] hey guys are you ever full HP and you
[01:57:09] try to you know God forbid you try to
[01:57:11] hold Eon kazua and then you get brutally
[01:57:14] punished does that ever happen to you
[01:57:15] because that happens to me yeah how
[01:57:17] relatable
[01:57:20] ha ha ha ha
[01:57:25] it
[01:57:30] yeah
[01:57:33] evil conquering
[01:57:36] socks your mistake was actually playing
[01:57:38] the game so it's actually your fault for
[01:57:40] dying because you could have just not
[01:57:42] played the game and use any no abilities
[01:57:44] and just dodge uh the entire rotation
[01:57:46] and you wouldn't have died so honestly I
[01:57:48] would have died because the Japanese
[01:57:49] died uh ratio
[01:57:53] sense man no problem
[01:57:55] stop the ratio me but your point is
[01:57:56] valid
[01:58:03] Lament
[01:58:12] oh
[01:58:15] what the [ __ ] was that show this guy
[01:58:18] said [ __ ]
[01:58:20] what does ratio mean I don't understand
[01:58:23] uh it's like um
[01:58:28] why are you doing this Abyss clear I
[01:58:29] need Cosmo footage
[01:58:34] Chad I have a problem okay I recorded a
[01:58:36] casual like video right like uh is he uh
[01:58:39] you know is he still you know whatever
[01:58:41] the [ __ ] I don't know I'm gonna tell it
[01:58:43] here's my problem okay here's my problem
[01:58:45] I feel like okay we know listen not
[01:58:47] everyone is here at the start [ __ ] you
[01:58:48] sorry that was toxic
[01:58:50] thanks for being here at the start
[01:58:53] okay ideas
[01:58:54] listen
[01:58:58] I feel like what everyone wants to hear
[01:59:00] is okay pull for Causeway is good but
[01:59:02] like I feel like I have the obligation
[01:59:04] as a guide maker to be like oh here's
[01:59:07] the Nuance of when you might not need
[01:59:08] them but I also think he's like
[01:59:10] super convenient and his grouping makes
[01:59:12] your life a lot easier so I kind of want
[01:59:14] to say just pull but like that's not the
[01:59:15] answer so I ended up spending like 12
[01:59:17] minutes no I didn't edit it yet but
[01:59:19] it'll probably like eight minutes so
[01:59:21] probably like eight minutes talking
[01:59:22] about how good sucrose is but like I
[01:59:25] don't know if that'll scare the normies
[01:59:26] away like I don't know if talking about
[01:59:28] sucrose
[01:59:30] I don't know if talking about sucrose
[01:59:32] and when sucrose could be better or as
[01:59:34] good or worse but not that much worse is
[01:59:37] fine
[01:59:38] because like look like the point is like
[01:59:40] I still think for your account causes a
[01:59:42] really good pull even if you're not
[01:59:44] using him right now like even if like
[01:59:47] so there's some teams where it causes a
[01:59:49] strict upgrade and the summary isn't and
[01:59:51] like even if you're not playing if
[01:59:52] you're not playing that theme is not a
[01:59:53] multiple but I feel like even if you're
[01:59:55] not planning on like
[01:59:57] causaling now you're probably gonna want
[01:59:59] him but like then it's like okay well
[02:00:01] what if you don't but you're like free
[02:00:02] to play and you have like no characters
[02:00:03] then it's like okay well what if you
[02:00:05] want like Albert hytham so I don't know
[02:00:09] sucrose is our cringy dog
[02:00:13] uh
[02:00:16] yeah
[02:00:19] I don't know if that's true I wouldn't I
[02:00:20] would really say that but
[02:00:23] I do agree that Kazo is more of a Chad I
[02:00:26] don't think I
[02:00:33] why is the Jeff's wallpaper you in a
[02:00:36] maid outfit wait is it
[02:00:44] why do you look like the name 10 books
[02:00:46] guy who the [ __ ] is that
[02:00:54] foreign
[02:01:37] [Music]
[02:01:46] [Music]
[02:02:07] washed away
[02:02:11] stabilization
[02:02:16] [Music]
[02:02:21] no I'm burning no no
[02:02:28] fun
[02:02:31] solidify
[02:02:33] have you been since I know no
[02:02:38] he's just currently on the bench but
[02:02:39] he's not benched you get me like there's
[02:02:41] a difference between being bench and
[02:02:42] sitting on the bench willingly does that
[02:02:44] make sense
[02:02:54] [ __ ] why do I think okay
[02:02:58] [Music]
[02:03:07] but yeah so here's the like okay so
[02:03:09] here's my dilemma right
[02:03:12] it's like I feel okay I feel okay I feel
[02:03:15] okay I can't talk I feel like it would
[02:03:17] be more like more people would be happy
[02:03:21] if I was just like yes kazo's still good
[02:03:24] some teams don't need him but get them
[02:03:25] then if I go into a 10 minute deep dive
[02:03:29] on when sucrose is better and when kazoo
[02:03:31] is better and then if he's worth it for
[02:03:33] you or not but like I feel like that's
[02:03:35] better for information so it's like hard
[02:03:52] yeah so any basically any team where you
[02:03:56] want an on-field Nemo sucrose is better
[02:03:57] than kozua also he can be better she can
[02:04:00] be better and aggravate with hokushin
[02:04:02] ring and C6 usually her C6 infusion is
[02:04:05] the most dog [ __ ] piece of ass but in
[02:04:07] teams where there's only one element you
[02:04:09] can Infuse it's you know you can get it
[02:04:17] and regular National Vape teams it's Hit
[02:04:20] or Miss sometimes you better sometimes
[02:04:21] she's not regular National she is
[02:04:23] because she's on field
[02:04:26] well Bennett can like Fab on field but
[02:04:28] anyways
[02:04:50] so you do cause so good yeah
[02:04:52] yeah it's all needed but it's good 200
[02:04:54] yen plus another 200 em
[02:04:57] we take that no
[02:05:17] uh we'll do one more clear but basically
[02:05:20] like okay here's like the
[02:05:27] all right
[02:05:39] okay here's what it is right it's like
[02:05:41] okay here's like the the structure okay
[02:05:43] here's the here's the here's the the
[02:05:45] structure of of what I talked about so
[02:05:46] it's okay here's what it is so the the
[02:05:48] first part is like okay like
[02:05:52] you know everyone knows he's broken why
[02:05:53] so that's like a minute then it's what
[02:05:55] about with dendro like is he still good
[02:05:57] with dendro and then it splits into two
[02:05:58] where it's like some teams don't [ __ ]
[02:06:00] need him like you're playing this
[02:06:01] where's kooky you're playing [ __ ]
[02:06:04] like this you don't need them you're
[02:06:05] playing [ __ ] like anything that
[02:06:07] revolves around nilu you don't [ __ ]
[02:06:09] need him but then your second he
[02:06:10] probably needs him but then it's like
[02:06:11] okay well what is your second team so if
[02:06:12] your second team is something where
[02:06:14] uh he's a really really needed like you
[02:06:17] know ayaka freeze and then any other
[02:06:18] animal option you're basically [ __ ]
[02:06:20] like the griefing if you play and then
[02:06:22] you're playing like a moto team or
[02:06:24] you're playing like [ __ ] well those
[02:06:25] are the main two where he's like a
[02:06:26] strict upgrade or like Curry whatever
[02:06:28] the [ __ ] right like there's certain ones
[02:06:29] but then it's like in order to like talk
[02:06:31] about what your second team could be if
[02:06:33] you're not playing like a Denver team
[02:06:34] then it's like there's two things one is
[02:06:36] like okay
[02:06:37] you kind of have to explain how good
[02:06:39] sucrose is to see if Cosmo's a
[02:06:40] worthwhile upgrade but then on the other
[02:06:42] side it's like
[02:06:44] uh on the other side it's like some
[02:06:47] people just want kazua because the
[02:06:49] grouping's way better and way easier and
[02:06:51] he's more idiot proof and he helps for
[02:06:53] exploration so even if you're misled to
[02:06:57] pull casual you're probably gonna enjoy
[02:06:58] it but like I don't want him to sleep
[02:07:00] now that's like the point is like even
[02:07:01] people that like might not need it for
[02:07:03] their team will probably be happy with
[02:07:04] it but like it's hard to explain that
[02:07:07] and then it's also like
[02:07:09] on the other hand what's [ __ ] is like
[02:07:14] let's say you're playing it so no not
[02:07:15] what's up but on the other side some
[02:07:17] dendro teams like for example
[02:07:20] aggravate which is mostly an electro
[02:07:22] team but still dendro it's like kaching
[02:07:24] official nahida or I said official but I
[02:07:27] put kooky but let's say whatever you
[02:07:29] want a Healer sure oh no wait no no you
[02:07:31] could just do [ __ ] official uh yeah
[02:07:33] yeah
[02:07:34] so unless they're building an aggravate
[02:07:35] team right like this team wants Causeway
[02:07:37] but it's like
[02:07:38] if you have sucrose you can also just
[02:07:40] use sucrose okay and sucrose can be
[02:07:42] better with like kukushin ring C6 if
[02:07:44] you're infusing and if you need an
[02:07:46] on-field well not with kaching but let's
[02:07:48] say you're playing Beto Union on field
[02:07:49] that's even truer true or LOL W but you
[02:07:53] know
[02:07:54] where's Beto
[02:07:56] you know you got my point
[02:07:58] or taser teams but like in a team like
[02:08:02] this like especially with kazua with
[02:08:04] kaching especially with kaching it's
[02:08:05] like I feel like I want Cosmo like
[02:08:07] sucrose can be like
[02:08:08] also really good but Kazo helps grouping
[02:08:12] a lot
[02:08:13] you can like swap it in really fast e
[02:08:14] get the [ __ ] out and like I just feel
[02:08:17] like it's like smoother and easier to
[02:08:18] play and more new friendly and the
[02:08:21] grouping is really convenient but you
[02:08:24] don't need them here
[02:08:25] but it's like I feel like most people's
[02:08:27] lives would be improved if you get him
[02:08:28] here and it's like hard to convey that
[02:08:30] in a guide form
[02:08:32] because it's hard to be like
[02:08:35] you can just do gross and then you're
[02:08:36] fine but at the same time it's like I
[02:08:39] feel like someone in chat said sucrose e
[02:08:41] makes me kill myself it's like like Sue
[02:08:44] girls is good but like also her grouping
[02:08:46] it like doesn't work like it works but
[02:08:48] it's like brushing your teeth with your
[02:08:50] finger because you forgot your
[02:08:51] toothbrush at home while traveling so
[02:08:52] you're putting toothpaste on your finger
[02:08:53] it's like she's a good unit and her
[02:08:56] grouping works but it's like
[02:09:00] I would rather just Causeway
[02:09:06] but then it's like okay does that mean
[02:09:08] Cosmo's just better no because then
[02:09:09] there's teams where sucrose is better
[02:09:10] like let's say you're playing taser a
[02:09:12] lot of taser teams want an odd Fielder
[02:09:14] you might have ayato you might have like
[02:09:16] yeah if you want to aggravate yeah like
[02:09:18] well she's not really tasted but
[02:09:19] you might have it on Fielder
[02:09:21] but if you don't sucrose is really good
[02:09:24] and can sometimes be the best one
[02:09:25] especially professional as I said
[02:09:26] hukushin you can spam on field good up
[02:09:28] time you can C6 Infuse Electro or Hydro
[02:09:31] if your taser I guess it doesn't really
[02:09:33] matter but in aggravate you on Electro
[02:09:35] so like in that time super is better
[02:09:38] but then unless they're playing like
[02:09:39] freeze then causes strictly better
[02:09:43] so yeah you're basically saying Cosmo is
[02:09:45] more comfy causes quality of I guess
[02:09:47] that's a good thing
[02:09:49] to mention comfy well but is it comfy
[02:09:52] it's not really come I don't think
[02:09:53] sucrose is not comfy I think Kazu is
[02:09:55] just
[02:10:05] positive field time is so long not
[02:10:07] really
[02:10:10] quality of life yeah
[02:10:15] yeah so casual has the causal has kazoo
[02:10:19] has the quality of life
[02:10:23] because his grouping is way better
[02:10:30] and he's convenient for just any part in
[02:10:33] the game you're doing any base like he's
[02:10:35] good in so many different teams he's
[02:10:37] even good for just like running around
[02:10:38] the game
[02:10:40] and sucrose you can kind of feel stuck
[02:10:42] in her animations her burst doesn't
[02:10:43] really have iframes like it's weird
[02:10:46] but she's sometimes just better or
[02:10:49] sometimes your team could be like about
[02:10:51] as good DPS wise with either sucrose or
[02:10:53] Caswell but Kazo could be easier or fun
[02:10:55] and like more convenient
[02:10:57] so it's like hard to explain that in a
[02:10:59] guide form without pissing off the
[02:11:01] people that are like dude just pull a
[02:11:02] cosmo and pissing off the people that
[02:11:04] are like okay but sucrose is meta and
[02:11:06] then it's also like I feel like when
[02:11:07] people hear causal being compared to
[02:11:09] sucrose they're like wow you called
[02:11:10] cause so bad it's like no I'm calling
[02:11:12] Sue girls broken
[02:11:14] so tldr recap
[02:11:19] some teams need Caswell others you can
[02:11:21] replace them with sucrose but if you
[02:11:23] just want convenient grouping or like
[02:11:24] them then you can get cause as an
[02:11:26] upgrade or if you play certain teams or
[02:11:28] causes really good get Causeway but also
[02:11:31] keep in mind that I think both are good
[02:11:33] and both have their uses so you probably
[02:11:34] want both on your account unless you
[02:11:36] only are gonna play two teams for your
[02:11:38] whole life a lot of the times you want
[02:11:39] to have both
[02:11:41] if you're someone who's like hey I'm
[02:11:43] playing nilu Bloom first half and second
[02:11:45] half I'm playing I'll haitham you might
[02:11:46] not need either sucrose or casual and
[02:11:48] that's fine
[02:11:51] but
[02:11:53] but a lot of times
[02:11:55] you'll want to cause on your account for
[02:11:57] a lot of teams basically any Elemental
[02:11:58] team that you can swirl even some danger
[02:12:00] ones like aggravate or tanari brother
[02:12:04] uh or something with like let's say yai
[02:12:07] and then you could do double electrics
[02:12:08] that you don't have a Healer here so a
[02:12:10] lot of times people run strongly but you
[02:12:11] can also do like some kooky [ __ ] you
[02:12:12] could do like this right
[02:12:15] um
[02:12:18] also someone said and this is actually a
[02:12:20] really good comment I want to pull it up
[02:12:21] someone said I have to scroll
[02:12:26] um
[02:12:29] where the [ __ ] is it
[02:12:34] no oh I can't find
[02:12:38] so gross being accessible four star
[02:12:39] means that a lot of newer players can
[02:12:41] have really good easy teams like taser
[02:12:43] or Salad which is taser with dendro
[02:12:45] and then you can like save your Primus
[02:12:47] or whatever character you need maybe
[02:12:48] coso for another team but also maybe
[02:12:50] like a different character uh but
[02:12:52] someone said
[02:12:55] where is it
[02:13:01] never met someone that Professor
[02:13:02] crossover Caswell as a Jeff house was
[02:13:05] better in every situation except for
[02:13:06] taser also some national teams and some
[02:13:08] aggravate teams but yeah
[02:13:10] Tesla's usually better
[02:13:13] anyways I'm sure I can find it later if
[02:13:16] it matters but someone was like it's
[02:13:18] almost like how is sucrose meta if no
[02:13:19] one plays her that's actually a good
[02:13:21] take because I feel like people don't
[02:13:23] like her or it's weird either people
[02:13:25] don't like her because she's kind of
[02:13:26] clunky which I think she is or people
[02:13:29] don't know how good she is it's like one
[02:13:31] or the other
[02:13:32] but I do think she's clunky and I do
[02:13:35] think cos was a lot smoother
[02:13:38] but that doesn't mean she's not broken
[02:13:44] but I do think she's clunky like
[02:14:00] like I do think sometimes wait let me
[02:14:03] grip them
[02:14:07] this guy knocking out I just think like
[02:14:08] it is like you're still gonna like group
[02:14:10] them but like if you get hit during your
[02:14:12] burst it's kind of [ __ ] annoying but
[02:14:14] like you know
[02:14:19] bad playing her taser can feel like
[02:14:22] actually no I think these was fun I'm
[02:14:24] not gonna talk taser
[02:14:33] I think his is really good
[02:14:49] yeah that's another big thing I think I
[02:14:51] have never met any Causeway regretter in
[02:14:54] my life
[02:14:57] how do you infuse sucrose's burst
[02:14:59] correctly you don't she decides what she
[02:15:01] wants to infuse on that given day
[02:15:03] the thing is usually who the [ __ ] cares
[02:15:05] [ __ ] it but in some teams like in taser
[02:15:08] it doesn't matter if you get Electro
[02:15:09] Hydro if sanctions broken your electric
[02:15:11] character is broken in aggravate you're
[02:15:14] gonna Infuse Electro like unless the
[02:15:16] enemy is like coughs and then it infuses
[02:15:19] the cough element usually
[02:15:22] if you do sucrose
[02:15:27] um
[02:15:29] official oh sorry what am I saying if
[02:15:31] you do aggravate so like let's say
[02:15:32] sucrose official Albedo right or is Beto
[02:15:37] beta's 90. so it should be up here
[02:15:45] where the [ __ ] is Beto is she not 90
[02:15:49] my videos not 90.
[02:15:51] whatever if you do sucrose special Beto
[02:15:53] and then aggravate right so let's say a
[02:15:55] dendro healer
[02:15:56] and you use your burst on sucrose it's
[02:15:58] gonna Infuse Electro like yeah it's
[02:16:00] inconsistent yeah sometimes enemies can
[02:16:02] cough pyro and then you're [ __ ] but
[02:16:04] you can't swirl dendro you can't swirl a
[02:16:07] Nemo so you're gonna like you know
[02:16:09] it's an email plus something so you're
[02:16:11] gonna get the [ __ ] Electro so C6 does
[02:16:13] matter in this team
[02:16:21] do you use cause or sucrose more
[02:16:24] uh honestly
[02:16:28] like Kazo is probably the answer but
[02:16:31] unironically I usually do like four star
[02:16:32] clears with sucrose and then my main
[02:16:35] teams are like
[02:16:36] Xiao where sometimes these cows are
[02:16:38] sometimes I don't and then like I'll
[02:16:40] hike them and like nilu and [ __ ] like
[02:16:42] that where I don't use them but like
[02:16:43] that doesn't mean I yeah like yeah
[02:16:45] that's just because I play like specific
[02:16:47] teams
[02:16:48] like if you play dude if you play Xiao I
[02:16:50] hate them why the [ __ ] are you getting
[02:16:52] calls up like you're getting them for
[02:16:53] your other teams and he's broken for
[02:16:55] that so that's cool
[02:16:57] but like a lot of a lot of people are
[02:16:59] like oh only build eight characters and
[02:17:01] then in that case it's like you don't
[02:17:02] always need them but I also think adding
[02:17:04] something to your account is like really
[02:17:05] good come
[02:17:11] yeah studio is also better for Xiao but
[02:17:14] I personally think Cosmo got a buff
[02:17:17] because farzan like I think I really
[02:17:20] really really really really really think
[02:17:21] these teams
[02:17:24] with either Xiao or Scara
[02:17:27] like if you don't need a shield of
[02:17:29] garlic you don't need like Thomas or
[02:17:30] Zhang li like I actually think Cosmo
[02:17:32] crit is like a good option I don't know
[02:17:34] like I just think it's like because the
[02:17:35] damage is good the grouping is good so
[02:17:37] why wouldn't you do it it's just good
[02:17:38] but it's like a lot of times your other
[02:17:40] team needs calls though so I don't like
[02:17:41] to recommend it but if you have it just
[02:17:43] use it
[02:18:03] the zionics don't lie to your viewers
[02:18:05] are true [ __ ] I was lying oh my God
[02:18:09] you're right
[02:18:12] dude I'm trying to sugarcoat it because
[02:18:14] some of you [ __ ] are too afraid
[02:18:16] to admit that sucrose is better in
[02:18:17] certain situations but people don't get
[02:18:19] it
[02:18:20] so I'm trying to like present it nicely
[02:18:23] with nuance
[02:18:38] yep
[02:18:56] move on from this debate it's not a
[02:18:58] debate I'm just figuring out how to
[02:19:00] explain it because I know I'm right
[02:19:01] it's not a debate
[02:19:03] and I don't think anyone like disagrees
[02:19:06] it's it's just true like you can't be
[02:19:08] like oh yeah well actually
[02:19:15] okay count the time uh so I think we do
[02:19:20] oh I have 1500 resin okay I need Crystal
[02:19:22] flies
[02:19:30] okay
[02:19:31] um there's a reason for it I said
[02:19:33] there's a reason for it
[02:19:35] take mine dude sour water you said I
[02:19:38] could take you crucifies like three out
[02:19:40] like I said that started stream two
[02:19:42] hours ago

[02:21:26] wait how did they have alloy the [ __ ]
[02:21:33] I just copy pasted so I don't know how
[02:21:35] it would be the wrong one
[02:21:40] oh
[02:21:42] inkle
[02:21:43] accidental yai and kagura
[02:21:48] I'm okay all right how did I do this
[02:21:51] again uh uh is it in France or in Co-op
[02:21:55] wasn't Co-op
[02:22:03] dude how do you accidental on a weapon
[02:22:06] Banner huh what were you trying to do on
[02:22:08] that Banner
[02:22:12] what are you trying to do on that Banner
[02:22:14] huh
[02:22:20] Savage actually unironically it might
[02:22:23] have been a Savage
[02:22:25] they just wanted fudge
[02:22:39] are there Crystal Vice here did I just
[02:22:40] mark this because there's [ __ ] cats
[02:22:53] okay
[02:22:55] all right let's get the advice
[02:23:08] well yeah I I I don't know like
[02:23:11] not to reopen this because I want to
[02:23:14] segue away from it but I do think that I
[02:23:16] I I do think I owe
[02:23:21] oh yeah I think it's Auto wait is this
[02:23:24] my place it might still be
[02:23:26] oh no no it's autoplaying what the [ __ ]
[02:23:28] is it playing dude it autoplayed my
[02:23:30] playlist okay so I'm using YouTube
[02:23:31] because I can't listen to hardstyle
[02:23:33] songs on Spotify and my playlist ended
[02:23:36] and it's Auto playing so this has been
[02:23:39] autoplaying for 40 minutes but it's so
[02:23:40] quiet I couldn't even tell I don't know
[02:23:42] what the [ __ ] is playing bro I don't
[02:23:45] know listen that was not me that was not
[02:23:47] me
[02:23:48] I didn't choose that
[02:23:52] okay listen to art
[02:23:55] our chill background music copyright
[02:23:57] free playlist
[02:24:03] anyways as I was saying I think I owe my
[02:24:06] like viewers like YouTube viewers
[02:24:10] I owe them
[02:24:12] the like
[02:24:21] how does this I believe they're
[02:24:23] deserving of enough respect
[02:24:26] to present the discourse
[02:24:28] of when
[02:24:31] in terms of like efficiency for their
[02:24:34] account
[02:24:38] just using sucrose is better I believe
[02:24:41] there are worthy of of that conclusion
[02:24:44] however
[02:24:48] foreign
[02:24:50] I do think you're more popular if you're
[02:24:52] just like
[02:24:54] haha who cares
[02:24:56] let's get them
[02:25:11] where is blood going okay first of all
[02:25:14] don't call me that instead of all what
[02:25:17] do you mean where am I going I'm
[02:25:19] literally getting Crystal
[02:25:20] no
[02:25:25] make both no it's one video it's just
[02:25:28] hard to like
[02:25:30] it's hard to
[02:25:33] I am bad at I don't think I'm bad at it
[02:25:36] but I overthink it a lot
[02:25:39] um
[02:25:40] about presenting like I don't know how
[02:25:43] to present
[02:25:46] like nuance
[02:25:49] actually that's not true I think I know
[02:25:50] how but I don't know how to do it
[02:25:53] in the most optimal way because I feel
[02:25:54] like
[02:25:55] your words need to be in a specific
[02:25:57] order like I feel like if the point I
[02:26:00] have to get across is correct I feel
[02:26:03] like if I don't if I explain it wrong
[02:26:09] it portrays the wrong message
[02:26:17] because like no like my point is like
[02:26:19] if I say what I have to say within four
[02:26:21] minutes if the first minute
[02:26:23] is the bad part it'll upset more people
[02:26:26] than if the bat the last minute is the
[02:26:27] bad part does that make sense
[02:26:29] like if I say like
[02:26:32] so yeah it's like I don't I don't know
[02:26:44] why does he suddenly not know how to
[02:26:46] talk
[02:26:48] I just over I already recorded it I just
[02:26:50] overthink it a lot that's all
[02:27:00] because it's like there can be multiple
[02:27:03] things that are true at the same time
[02:27:04] for example it could be like there are
[02:27:07] certain accounts where
[02:27:09] there could be like 10 characters who
[02:27:11] are more or like like six characters
[02:27:14] that are more worth pulling than even
[02:27:17] someone as really like even someone as
[02:27:19] good as causal right there could be like
[02:27:20] certain accounts that just wouldn't use
[02:27:22] him or in the one instance where they
[02:27:24] would sucrose would be as good or better
[02:27:25] but it's like
[02:27:27] I feel like even that person even if
[02:27:29] that's your account you don't want to
[02:27:30] hear that you're probably like I just
[02:27:31] want Caswell because he groups better
[02:27:33] we're like that's fair that's fair but
[02:27:35] like how the [ __ ] do you explain that
[02:27:37] when even the person who could be using
[02:27:39] like who yeah yeah
[02:27:43] my perfect job
[02:27:54] it's like telling me to skip it's like
[02:27:56] telling me to skip my favorite pyro
[02:27:58] character because strangling exists dude
[02:28:00] [ __ ] you I'm playing I'm playing my
[02:28:02] favorite Power character
[02:28:03] [ __ ] you you can't tell me to play
[02:28:05] shangling
[02:28:07] but like you know that doesn't mean
[02:28:12] this
[02:28:21] don't be scared
[02:28:31] I cannot live without kazua I mean yeah
[02:28:33] that's pretty based I'm in the same boat
[02:28:38] all right thanks for your world uh we
[02:28:40] can go farm artifacts now
[02:28:45] foreign
[02:28:56] at all okay but then you're dumb if
[02:28:58] you're watching us the Elan video and
[02:29:00] you don't want to hear about singtra
[02:29:01] you're objectively okay I don't insult
[02:29:04] people but that's just dude what the
[02:29:06] [ __ ] are you saying yeah if I'm watching
[02:29:07] uh if I'm watching her should you pull
[02:29:09] for yomiya I don't want to hear about
[02:29:10] hutau or uh Shang Ling actually actually
[02:29:14] if I'm listening to a hey how good is is
[02:29:16] Dory I don't want to hear that kooky
[02:29:18] exists no it's part of it if you're free
[02:29:21] to play and all you care about is meta
[02:29:23] like like okay if you don't care about
[02:29:26] meta why the [ __ ] are you watching it
[02:29:28] like pull you on who cares play for fun
[02:29:30] I play for fun I don't give a [ __ ] like
[02:29:31] you know but it also matter like some
[02:29:33] people care about the damage they deal
[02:29:35] and a lot since the gotcha game you
[02:29:38] can't just be like yeah I think this
[02:29:39] character is good so get this character
[02:29:46] dude there's some accounts that don't
[02:29:48] even use actually no everyone uses
[02:29:49] Bennett if you don't use Bennett rethink
[02:29:51] your life choices but dude you might be
[02:29:53] playing hyper blue but nilu you might
[02:29:55] not even be using the best character
[02:29:57] that's okay
[02:30:00] you might not even be using better
[02:30:01] that's fine
[02:30:15] it's unfair you compare yamira hutau why
[02:30:17] not compare to Toma okay but listen
[02:30:19] are the same price they're limited five
[02:30:22] star characters does that mean you're me
[02:30:24] is bad no you can still use her and
[02:30:25] clear everything with her but does that
[02:30:27] mean you should like what do you still
[02:30:29] have to consider the [ __ ] other
[02:30:31] options
[02:30:40] all right
[02:30:42] you got only for meta players no but if
[02:30:44] I'm making okay no
[02:30:46] because I'm not talking about a guide
[02:30:47] now I'm talking about a shooting you
[02:30:48] pull video that's different and should
[02:30:50] you pull videos if you don't objectively
[02:30:52] include like
[02:30:54] dude okay if you're watching or should
[02:30:55] you pull for someone to be like yeah
[02:30:57] this character makes me happy get them
[02:30:59] like what the [ __ ] is the point of that
[02:31:01] video actually like genuinely what is
[02:31:03] the purpose like what did that help you
[02:31:05] with like unless it's like like yeah
[02:31:11] foreign
[02:31:42] character yes and I know that but that's
[02:31:44] not the point imagine if you're a music
[02:31:47] critic and you say every song is good
[02:31:48] right think about it and this is a
[02:31:50] gotcha game so it's like actual money
[02:31:51] being spent like imagine if you're like
[02:31:53] a [ __ ] like IGN and then you rate
[02:31:55] every game of nine what the [ __ ] is the
[02:31:57] point of your existence right
[02:32:05] boom boom
[02:32:09] oh yeah it's a shitty pull it's not a
[02:32:11] guide It's there's a difference
[02:32:19] they do yeah that was the point I Jen is
[02:32:23] called Mega LOL
[02:32:25] yeah guys are also more like uh they're
[02:32:29] more objective than should you pull
[02:32:31] videos three people videos are more
[02:32:32] subject uh yeah they are more subjective
[02:32:39] don't press claim wait why do I not need
[02:32:42] this I'm pretty sure I need it

[02:36:29] I will say those in the defense of of
[02:36:32] casual as a cause of a lover that I am I
[02:36:36] think that the like I think it is kind
[02:36:38] of a pointless debate because like
[02:36:43] there's no there's no need
[02:36:46] quicker
[02:36:49] I don't know
[02:36:58] well I'm gonna find this guy question
[02:37:01] mark okay I I didn't finish the sentence
[02:37:06] I need to think thoughts before I say
[02:37:09] them nothing left
[02:37:13] that's it I can't just talk without
[02:37:15] thinking first
[02:37:20] okay [ __ ] you guys
[02:37:23] kills
[02:37:26] no like my point was I think it's kind
[02:37:29] of a pointless debate past the sentence
[02:37:32] of
[02:37:34] she is like
[02:37:36] sucrose is better on field some
[02:37:39] aggravate teams some national teams and
[02:37:41] then whatever else and then ending it
[02:37:42] there I feel like explaining why that's
[02:37:45] true and why sometimes it's not true
[02:37:48] depending on how much grouping and [ __ ]
[02:37:49] you want is like not it's kind of a
[02:37:51] waste of time
[02:37:53] like I feel like even if like I'm right
[02:37:56] it might not be worth the words
[02:38:00] I don't know why are we talking about
[02:38:02] this again because it's in my head I'm

[02:38:38] kokomi Chichi we are two damage dealing
[02:38:41] characters look I love kokomi I'm the
[02:38:43] biggest kokomi fan in the world but all

[02:41:07] hate them but I the week resets in 16
[02:41:11] minutes and I need to do three or at
[02:41:13] least two weekly bosses and I don't
[02:41:16] [ __ ] have time to co-op so I love

[02:41:47] you can't kick people when they're like
[02:41:48] in an instance or something in between
[02:41:49] scenes or whatever the [ __ ] so you have
[02:41:51] to go to the teapot to kick them I think
[02:41:52] unless it's another way but I don't
[02:41:54] [ __ ] know I'm not a co-op Andy

[02:43:37] the same here because a lot of enemies

[02:43:49] this is so much faster
[02:44:18] when you're not dendro it is okay true
[02:44:20] but also that was dude that was more
[02:44:23] everyone else's fault not to blame
[02:44:26] others okay but literally we had a guy
[02:44:29] doing like 1K damage we had kokomi

[02:45:28] never gonna come in a domain that is
[02:45:30] draining me of my sanity my happiness

[02:46:00] me with deepwood yeah but at least
[02:46:02] deepwood is like good and gilded is good

[02:50:39] every time ha ha
[02:50:45] what do you think the first Fontan
[02:50:47] weekly boss gonna be I'm thinking it's
[02:50:49] like
[02:50:49] it's the region on France right you know
[02:50:51] French they like didn't they like
[02:50:54] didn't they like Guillotine they're like
[02:50:56] what do they what if it's like the off
[02:50:58] with your like what if they like they
[02:51:00] find the king and they Guillotine them
[02:51:01] and then we have to fight the king
[02:51:03] headless King
[02:51:07] foreign
[02:51:26] I'm not giving you advice for hyper
[02:51:30] carry alloy
[02:51:37] that's not a real question
[02:51:41] okay let's go do
[02:51:44] um chat okay I have a dilemma it's a new
[02:51:48] day I'm a new man I have 1400 resin five
[02:51:53] fragile resins
[02:51:55] 59 sorry
[02:51:57] five condensed resin
[02:52:00] some other things I can use where am I
[02:52:02] gonna spend all of this resin
[02:52:07] where's the story I already said it
[02:52:09] the Oxford comma was credited to me so
[02:52:11] they gave me resin
[02:52:25] now I have a theory
[02:52:27] a game theory that if you try really
[02:52:31] hard
[02:52:31] and you know you don't succeed the first
[02:52:33] few times but you persevere you keep
[02:52:36] going you push through the struggle
[02:52:38] I think at one at one point
[02:52:41] you're my favorite show me a main true I
[02:52:44] think at one point you're bound to get
[02:52:46] rewarded
[02:52:47] I think that's where we're at with
[02:52:49] Vermillion thanks to the sub I'll close
[02:52:52] I think
[02:52:56] I think we're at that point
[02:52:59] no ah you might you might be doubting so
[02:53:02] we'll do a trial run
[02:53:04] we'll do we'll do something that no one
[02:53:06] has ever done we're gonna do machine
[02:53:08] Nest level three okay you may be like
[02:53:11] what if you don't get a five star I know
[02:53:12] I'm gonna go five star I actually know
[02:53:14] that maybe like I I think this is like
[02:53:17] the secret artifact Hideout this is
[02:53:20] where the good artifacts are watched one
[02:53:22] run one run look one run if I'm wrong if
[02:53:25] I'm wrong
[02:53:27] I'll admit it
[02:53:29] I'll admit if I'm wrong
[02:53:33] okay
[02:53:35] do people say that
[02:53:37] people say that someone who who who
[02:53:39] sells all of his everything he owns and
[02:53:42] invests it in in in in in in Microsoft
[02:53:45] in the year of 1841 and then Microsoft
[02:53:48] pops off are you gonna be like oh you're
[02:53:50] [ __ ] stupid no it was an investment
[02:53:52] okay what am I doing I'm investing in
[02:53:54] Vermilion and honestly it's about to pay
[02:53:56] out
[02:53:57] what is happening okay okay good
[02:54:00] rotation good rotation
[02:54:03] me up
[02:54:10] everybody
[02:54:13] yep that was okay
[02:54:19] no I don't chaos breasts uh that's rich
[02:54:22] coming from you but no I don't watch
[02:54:25] or just I think this domain level three
[02:54:29] is where the good artifacts for hiding
[02:54:30] watch
[02:54:33] okay okay
[02:54:41] that's actually a minus 20. like
[02:54:44] sometimes you type minus 20 and it's not
[02:54:46] my Sony that one was actually minus 20.
[02:54:48] okay fair enough fair enough but I think
[02:54:50] the once we actually get a five star
[02:54:52] it'll be a good one
[02:54:54] because I'd rather pay 40 resin for a
[02:54:57] good artifact than 20 resin for a
[02:55:00] artifacts
[02:55:19] actually reasonable logic yeah exactly
[02:55:21] so we spent 20 we got nothing now we're
[02:55:23] guaranteed to get something because of
[02:55:25] the law of probability so now we get a
[02:55:27] five star and it's amazing
[02:55:30] wait if this gets grid raped then I may
[02:55:33] have cooked something
[02:55:36] if this is great everyone who doubted me
[02:55:42] you will be laughed at
[02:55:45] my throat hurts
[02:55:49] gulp all right Paul champ
[02:56:01] I have never seen this piece roll
[02:56:04] anything other than crit rate not once
[02:56:11] foreign
[02:56:28] she cursed me
[02:56:32] okay now we need to play a team that's
[02:56:33] not a friend from 10 I think my coaching
[02:56:34] team's not
[02:56:49] what the [ __ ] is character not on the

[02:57:05] she's dead
[02:57:09] hey what what if the reason you get bad
[02:57:12] pieces is because you always refresh the
[02:57:15] game knows you'll spend money
[02:57:22] no they they would give me good
[02:57:24] artifacts if they finish this quickly
[02:57:26] they give garfax if you do spend true
[02:57:30] the threads of your fate lie in my hand
[02:57:32] wait kaching wasn't dead chat

[03:11:55] sometimes you can say something so dumb
[03:11:57] that it becomes stupid and oh no [ __ ] I
[03:11:59] keep say something so down there to
[03:12:02] become smart okay as long as you can
[03:12:03] like sometimes you can say something so
[03:12:05] not funny it becomes funny and and
[03:12:07] similar in a similar vein

[03:12:11] the point of this
[03:12:13] come on

[03:14:46] where every time I saw every time we
[03:14:49] would see 1010 at a con because we can
[03:14:52] usually hang out a bit every time we saw
[03:14:53] him at a con he would he would costly
[03:14:56] venti but he had progressively less and
[03:14:58] less clothing he started with a normal
[03:15:00] veggie cosplay then he did the archon
[03:15:02] outfit that had like it's like leg
[03:15:04] exposed and [ __ ] then he did a like a

[03:26:06] we have boyfriends Gage okay I mean good
[03:26:10] for you that I that's not what I was
[03:26:12] implying I was implying that because
[03:26:14] again
[03:26:31] what happens when you get perfect for a
[03:26:33] million artifacts it's like
[03:26:36] it's like if you okay imagine a
[03:26:38] superhero okay and he has a villain uh a
[03:26:41] arch nemesis okay and then his reason to
[03:26:44] live is to stop the villain and the
[03:26:46] villain's reason to live is to stop you
[03:26:49] know kill the hero right
[03:26:51] Dr Doofenshmirtz if you will okay and
[03:26:55] let's say the villain one day manages to
[03:26:58] actually win the villain kills a hero
[03:27:01] he did it the killer villain won he
[03:27:05] killed the superhero
[03:27:07] why do you think is gonna happen he's
[03:27:08] gonna be depressed sad what the [ __ ] is
[03:27:10] the point anymore no
[03:27:12] the the my my match is no longer here
[03:27:16] what can I do he's sad
[03:27:19] and I think that is me with Vermillion I
[03:27:23] don't wanna I don't know if when we'll
[03:27:26] reach the end I don't know if we can and
[03:27:29] I don't know where we go from there
[03:27:32] but the goal is the journey it's not
[03:27:36] about the journey it's not about the
[03:27:38] destination it's about the journey
[03:27:41] again
[03:27:44] it's not about the destination it's
[03:27:47] about the journey
[03:27:52] and I'm saying you know we'll see what
[03:27:54] happens
[03:28:13] I'll stop talking about Geo if you can
[03:28:15] help me build a property you know what
[03:28:17] [ __ ] sure fine you know what fine
[03:28:19] give me a [ __ ] give me your uid no
[03:28:22] actually don't do that give me
[03:28:25] foreign
[03:28:33] here
[03:28:37] and I'll I'll make your team two teams
[03:28:40] like how we used to do old account
[03:28:42] reviews before the anchorship
[03:29:22] what did I just get
[03:29:23] oh
[03:29:26] what are you doing on balls
[03:29:31] I have Bobo
[03:29:34] all right I have no faith in this
[03:29:35] artifact so let's just rip the Band-Aid
[03:29:37] because I don't think it's rolling crit
[03:29:43] I mean it could still be good 20 dude
[03:29:45] that's actually good if it gets 20
[03:29:46] damage it's actually good
[03:29:48] I know you guys are laughing but it
[03:29:50] could actually get 20 damage and then 20
[03:29:51] crit damage ER to attack it's actually
[03:29:53] not bad
[03:29:56] it could be good
[03:30:01] it's only copium if it doesn't hit crit
[03:30:03] damage here okay all right
[03:30:10] it was still
[03:30:13] no you guys were calling it bad before
[03:30:15] it was bad like yeah now it's bad but at
[03:30:18] the time it wasn't known that it was bad
[03:30:28] yeah as you wish me
[03:30:31] look at my burst hello my check
[03:30:34] I need a fallen leaves
[03:30:42] are you so gross because I wanna Groove
[03:30:45] you and me together okay but uh us
[03:30:47] there's a small flaw in your logic
[03:30:48] sucrose doesn't group enemies she
[03:30:50] [ __ ] anymore
[03:30:51] then they get launched the [ __ ]
[03:30:53] Oblivion so nice try that Riz won't work
[03:30:55] on me I know better
[03:30:59] let's try though nice try though
[03:31:02] nice try though
[03:31:13] let's try guys we'll get him next round
[03:31:15] nice try
[03:31:20] what if we what if we claim at the last
[03:31:22] possible pixel like as far as possible
[03:31:25] from the tree
[03:31:28] yeah right here wait can I do more
[03:31:30] no I can't all right
[03:31:33] but we don't skip
[03:31:49] what was that I'm not looking
[03:31:55] well why can't I find the thing that I
[03:31:56] use to make teams
[03:32:00] okay I got it
[03:32:05] I'm lucky
[03:32:07] all right geoman finally set their Lake
[03:32:13] and if I help them make teams they'll
[03:32:15] stop playing Geo
[03:32:16] or stop talking about Geo
[03:32:19] what is this wait you're actually a Geo
[03:32:21] player
[03:32:23] my face cam is blocking some of it
[03:32:25] actually it's fine it's only Sarah
[03:32:29] wait what the wait this is so cursed
[03:32:31] what the [ __ ]
[03:32:35] you're a Geo main but you don't have
[03:32:37] Albedo or Jeong Li actually or Ito
[03:32:40] because I actually cursed
[03:32:48] wait you also don't embed it
[03:32:51] wait
[03:33:01] dumb
[03:33:04] how the [ __ ] did you dodge Synchro and
[03:33:07] Bennett
[03:33:11] wait do you have Beto I can't see Beto
[03:33:12] oh my God you don't have Beto either
[03:33:14] Beto's so broken wait how okay listen
[03:33:18] I'm not just bullying I'll make you
[03:33:19] teams don't worry but no that's not
[03:33:21] lucky I highly recommend
[03:33:23] you get Synchro and Bennett or whichever
[03:33:27] one
[03:33:28] from the Star glitter shop if you have
[03:33:29] star glitter save it don't get pose with
[03:33:31] it gets thing show get Bennett if you
[03:33:34] can because they rotate monthly
[03:33:39] um
[03:33:42] okay if you actually want teams you can
[03:33:44] do quite a bit like you have you have
[03:33:46] tanari and yaimiko you know you can make
[03:33:48] a team from that uh you can also make it
[03:33:50] just a normal aggravate Team without
[03:33:52] them you could do a gone you no you
[03:33:54] can't you don't bet it
[03:34:04] and you're not gonna gone you melt
[03:34:06] because you don't even have Bennett for
[03:34:08] shangling
[03:34:09] and you can't Dale because you don't
[03:34:11] have nahita like you get okay you don't
[03:34:13] like you can't gone you in Akita
[03:34:25] but you probably like on you so I don't
[03:34:27] want to say don't user I'll just say
[03:34:28] like wait for Bennett
[03:34:31] because if you both were gone you
[03:34:33] probably like her so just wait for about
[03:34:34] it
[03:34:36] then you could do like
[03:34:57] you're like these things but it depends
[03:35:00] like right now you can't do a Gandhi
[03:35:02] team so like if you want to do something
[03:35:03] right now you do like
[03:35:06] aggravate and then you could either do
[03:35:07] an Animo character to swirl Electro or
[03:35:10] you could do tanari you could do till
[03:35:12] any in this team I would level him it's
[03:35:13] pretty good you could either replace
[03:35:14] Kirara and then go any mo but then you
[03:35:16] need a Healer or you can keep your root
[03:35:18] double down to double Electro I like
[03:35:20] having a Nemo character in the team but
[03:35:21] it swords too oh yeah yeah also you
[03:35:24] could use Yaya instead I mean they're
[03:35:25] about as good there
[03:35:28] um
[03:35:29] but you could also do something like do
[03:35:31] you have cookie
[03:35:33] you don't have cookie
[03:35:40] um
[03:35:43] yeah no it's fine you like I wouldn't
[03:35:44] play yeah yeah I just do like you could
[03:35:46] yeah yeah [ __ ] it just do this just do
[03:35:49] this
[03:35:51] um that's pretty good it's just I like
[03:35:52] Animo in this team but like that's fine
[03:35:54] just do this yeah and you can't really
[03:35:56] like yeah and then you'd use two girls
[03:35:58] in your other team so like
[03:36:00] oh here you want wrongly or
[03:36:03] ah
[03:36:08] what else can you play if you don't play
[03:36:09] Gone you if you don't play Gone here you
[03:36:11] could do
[03:36:17] you can't even hyperloom because you
[03:36:18] don't have sync control
[03:36:23] they are I mean yeah you could put day
[03:36:25] as your last slot but like dude at that
[03:36:28] point okay unironically at that point
[03:36:32] but okay Cosmo's the next Banner like
[03:36:34] you can probably so this account seems
[03:36:36] early game enough that you can probably
[03:36:39] clear content and get gems to get kazua
[03:36:42] if you're not like super unlucky
[03:36:46] and then Cosmo would really help the
[03:36:48] Gandhi team or but you still don't have
[03:36:50] a shield but you could you could do it
[03:36:51] or you could do gonyu uh Kazo with um
[03:36:54] what's the other team was thinking of
[03:36:58] [ __ ] I was thinking of a team
[03:37:00] uh uh
[03:37:04] yeah you could also mono pyro you do
[03:37:06] shangling Bennett and then dare
[03:37:10] unironically might play Dale
[03:37:14] obviously like well I mean okay to be
[03:37:16] fair what would be better than Dale
[03:37:20] I say unironically but like
[03:37:25] I'd probably just go Barbara Vape but
[03:37:27] like maybe you're shingling I'd probably
[03:37:29] still I would probably still be better
[03:37:31] uh not gonna lie but you know
[03:37:34] at some point you'll get sing Cho
[03:37:37] um yeah at that point just gone you
[03:37:44] I think they would like a geotv no they
[03:37:46] said oh something Jew if you give me
[03:37:47] teams to play but if you want to play
[03:37:48] Geo play Geo I just wouldn't recommend
[03:37:50] this lineup of Geo characters
[03:37:53] um
[03:37:54] Geo teams without the five star GEOS are
[03:37:57] like
[03:37:58] like [ __ ] Wong's fine but like ningon
[03:38:00] kind of wants like you to run like
[03:38:01] Bennett like you don't like buffing
[03:38:02] stuff or like seeing true official you
[03:38:04] don't have Central you don't have Beto
[03:38:06] so it's like kind of hard
[03:38:10] their Geo team is fine
[03:38:12] oh I mean
[03:38:15] I mean like sure
[03:38:24] I wouldn't call it fine High's eye zero
[03:38:27] X could you make two best teams for me
[03:38:30] as well I am unable to make twelve to
[03:38:32] three it's impossible yeah no also
[03:38:35] definitely not to six but still it's
[03:38:38] disappointing frown
[03:38:43] why'd I get a warning that this might
[03:38:45] contain erotic imagery
[03:39:02] maybe it teaches as well ah
[03:39:11] shh Maybe
[03:39:13] like for this Abyss I'll just say
[03:39:15] [ __ ] like for like this account I
[03:39:17] said go Beto for something so like like
[03:39:19] and this is probably Gonna Change by the
[03:39:21] time you hit Level Nine in [ __ ] so like
[03:39:22] just level [ __ ] level this aggravate
[03:39:24] team and then your second team will
[03:39:25] depend on who you get if you get Bennett
[03:39:27] there's a lot of teams you could do even
[03:39:28] like gone you [ __ ] if you got Kazo also
[03:39:30] a lot of things you can do uh if you get
[03:39:32] Syncro you could just play like
[03:39:33] changling well you'd want sing show and
[03:39:35] Bennett but if you don't get Bennett and
[03:39:36] you obviously show you could play like
[03:39:37] hyperloom you do like
[03:39:39] um okay actually like
[03:39:44] okay let's say
[03:39:46] you want to play hyperbloom right
[03:39:49] unless they want to play hyperloom you
[03:39:50] get Syncro you don't get any other four
[03:39:51] star what you would do is
[03:39:54] do everything troll
[03:39:57] and
[03:39:58] you don't have any other phone so let's
[03:39:59] put a dendro character let's say uh
[03:40:03] uh I mean
[03:40:05] let's say cave is on field no but
[03:40:12] let's just say yeah yeah yeah it was
[03:40:13] dendro app in single Target it's not
[03:40:15] that fast but anyway wait I actually
[03:40:17] just main character yeah
[03:40:28] let's just say this okay
[03:40:30] like since you don't have cookie you uh
[03:40:33] you know you might think just Dory and
[03:40:35] that would be pretty [ __ ] funny but
[03:40:37] uh I I
[03:40:40] would I mean you could I personally
[03:40:44] would recommend sucrose
[03:40:47] and then join King official from your
[03:40:49] other team the only problem with this
[03:40:51] team
[03:40:52] is you then don't have
[03:40:55] A Healer
[03:40:57] if you use facial here
[03:40:59] so if you get Beto you could put Beto
[03:41:02] here
[03:41:03] uh and then your sugar's gonna be
[03:41:05] hyperblooming solo Electro beta she'll
[03:41:07] need a lot of ER but like it'll work and
[03:41:09] then you'll be chilling Sugo's gonna
[03:41:10] hyperbloom you have damages this you
[03:41:12] have 70 plus damage res from Beto plus
[03:41:16] like synchros a bit of healing you'll be
[03:41:18] fine
[03:41:19] um but if you don't get it you could do
[03:41:22] official here but then you don't have a
[03:41:23] Healer if you're fine with that that's
[03:41:25] okay you can also play Yaya but then
[03:41:26] your dandruff's worse
[03:41:29] except an AOE
[03:41:31] or
[03:41:36] um
[03:41:40] you get Dory but I don't really like
[03:41:41] Dory
[03:41:45] low-key like your second for now I'd
[03:41:47] have one good team and then your second
[03:41:49] team depends on the next four star you
[03:41:51] get
[03:41:55] or swipe but like the thing is you don't
[03:41:57] need like yoi Mio wouldn't improve
[03:41:59] anything and like these four stars
[03:42:01] wouldn't either so it's like
[03:42:02] you kind of want Bennett or Synchro or
[03:42:05] Beto or all three ideally or kazua next
[03:42:07] Banner would be good
[03:42:11] as valuable on your account cause
[03:42:13] like
[03:42:14] even though he's usually an upgrade over
[03:42:16] uh Big T
[03:42:20] -shirt it's all like
[03:42:21] like it's not bigger of an upgrade than
[03:42:24] like causwell would be
[03:42:26] and like you already have one good team
[03:42:28] you would want like another one with
[03:42:29] different supports
[03:42:31] who's Big T
[03:42:34] Ana or your brother
[03:42:55] one time I sent my BF now x a clip of
[03:42:59] you and he just went what and then he
[03:43:01] broke up with me but hey at least my
[03:43:02] Abyss is yeah that can't be real
[03:43:05] that actually can't be real but if it's
[03:43:07] real okay okay if they did
[03:43:12] one with nature dude my Clips are
[03:43:15] Universal like anyone can understand
[03:43:17] them
[03:43:21] From Shadows so that's a W's
[03:43:33] I thought you fixed marriages I do they
[03:43:36] call me the
[03:43:39] Dr Phil
[03:43:47] wasn't using official glad you asked my
[03:43:50] official has 81 179 while using the wait
[03:43:54] why my word is hot
[03:44:02] thank you
[03:44:15] what happened to my official chat
[03:44:42] foreign
[03:44:55] I can't neglect my official
[03:45:04] to these uh Thunder suit is usually the
[03:45:06] best if you can maintain electric time
[03:45:08] gilded's also about us there it's
[03:45:10] basically subscribe dependent gilded and
[03:45:12] thundersoother
[03:45:14] uh also you could do two piece two piece
[03:45:17] of either TF
[03:45:19] an em set an attack set
[03:45:23] they're all pretty much
[03:45:25] similar
[03:45:28] [Music]
[03:45:31] nowhere to hide
[03:45:34] wow I still got that deal what the [ __ ]
[03:45:37] yeah
[03:45:38] or crit it's actually pretty similar
[03:45:42] it's like a few percent's different uh I
[03:45:46] would say if you're DPS and you're like
[03:45:47] Auto attacking [ __ ] probably crit but
[03:45:49] like it's actually pretty close
[03:45:52] so both are fine
[03:45:55] yeah I'm also team buff still but if
[03:45:57] you're like full hyper carry I'd
[03:45:58] probably just go [ __ ] crit
[03:46:14] ICS is it Vermillion is one for million
[03:46:24] I forgot I had this dude stream up in
[03:46:26] what the [ __ ] does that mean what the
[03:46:28] [ __ ] does that mean
[03:46:32] you just have me as an open tab in the
[03:46:34] background that you forget about the
[03:46:36] [ __ ] does that mean

[03:48:20] foreign
[03:48:58] no no like okay a lot of healers skills
[03:49:01] can also like some healers need their
[03:49:02] burst other healers need their skill but
[03:49:04] even though other healers that need
[03:49:05] their skill
[03:49:06] even if it's convenient you still
[03:49:08] usually need to be on field on whatever
[03:49:10] character's low HP Baidu just [ __ ]
[03:49:12] heals everyone from a skill
[03:49:21] why is the title kozlova prep and you're

[03:52:45] dude shape I shaved yesterday
[03:52:58] that was a lot two days ago
[03:53:05] what is your kaching build
[03:53:07] wait actually glad you asked actually
[03:53:09] hey hey first time chatter good question
[03:53:12] good question I'll show you so
[03:53:14] archanging is on four thundering Fury uh
[03:53:17] em says Electro goblet
[03:53:20] crit Circle it
[03:53:22] feather
[03:53:23] flower
[03:53:24] and uh we have a nice balance of em and
[03:53:27] attack because we are aggravating so
[03:53:29] yeah I'm really good around lighter
[03:53:30] volume incision right now uh for the em
[03:53:32] and the crit damage uh well the am you
[03:53:34] know conversion uh we have 68 criterate
[03:53:36] but don't be fooled we actually gained
[03:53:38] 15 crit rate on our passive right here
[03:53:41] when we use our burst so it's actually
[03:53:42] 68 plus 15 with 290 damage so that is
[03:53:45] our extreme build
[03:53:50] all right
[03:53:53] nice defense dude who the [ __ ] cares on
[03:53:56] 1K defense
[03:53:58] kaching's a naturally tanky character
[03:54:03] well I literally don't even have that
[03:54:04] much defense dude I just dude I don't
[03:54:07] even have that much defense
[03:54:14] [ __ ] you I'm going in this piece instead
[03:54:17] there's someone K now and you have 300
[03:54:19] damage so [ __ ] you freak you
[03:54:21] also
[03:54:24] I really I got this last stream because
[03:54:26] we did a challenge thing and I got it
[03:54:27] and I leveled it off stream the only
[03:54:29] problem is I listen I don't have enough
[03:54:33] for Rift towns and I don't want to
[03:54:35] [ __ ] kill Rift town so I don't know
[03:54:36] what to do
[03:54:40] well problems it's my only five star
[03:54:43] Catalyst other than Atlas and we got it
[03:54:46] because I had to Temple when I died
[03:54:52] I didn't want it
[03:54:55] seems like an emergency
[03:55:04] I hate those Wolves yeah I didn't
[03:55:07] [ __ ] explore Great Britain yet so I
[03:55:09] don't have enough
[03:55:18] thank you
[03:55:31] uh for Denver teams em sounds usually a
[03:55:33] bit better on yai because of the scaling
[03:55:35] plus she has a bit of extra yam scaling
[03:55:38] on her passive but it's not that big so
[03:55:40] stop slots matter
[03:55:46] that circle is good I just need a
[03:55:47] criterate one what was it HP
[03:55:49] I could lock it if it was HP but I just
[03:55:51] need I'm looking for crit rate
[03:55:55] per five because like a lot of my five
[03:55:57] characters are on millith
[03:56:02] yeah HP is good yeah I couldn't already
[03:56:04] are
[03:56:06] true
[03:56:16] dude what the dude none of these domains
[03:56:19] make me happy anymore what the [ __ ]
[03:56:20] should I do what domain should I do
[03:56:27] I [ __ ] it
[03:56:35] emblem yeah Emma's gonna be in the
[03:56:37] strong box surely
[03:56:39] [ __ ]

[03:57:04] this game can you show me your Clea
[03:57:06] build okay sure yeah all right
[03:57:09] yeah uh where's Clee we have the catch
[03:57:14] R5 four emblem C6 crowned uh both goba
[03:57:18] and power NATO and we have a six seven
[03:57:20] point six one four seven but we got 12
[03:57:22] created with the catch also a lot of
[03:57:23] yards that's my best build these are my
[03:57:24] shiny things uh my clear sorry is a bit
[03:57:26] better but for now that was fine
[03:57:30] wait actually I think this is my home I
[03:57:31] built
[03:57:33] but then yeah that's why my [ __ ] uh
[03:57:35] hotel is on the catch because it's my
[03:57:37] Homer build but I think then my crit
[03:57:39] rate's a little low but yeah still
[03:57:43] true
[03:57:45] what's that is bad for best for ayato
[03:57:47] technically Echoes but you probably
[03:57:49] shouldn't Farm it so glad or heart
[03:57:51] adapter about as good
[03:57:53] mind the side effects
[03:58:01] remember health comes first

[03:58:33] people who don't want to onfield sucrose
[03:58:37] okay
[03:58:38] decent
[03:58:40] I think I use them if you want like most
[03:58:41] of his teams are good not because of him
[03:58:43] but like they work like usually when you
[03:58:46] play Hazel
[03:58:48] it's like a taser sucrose team or like
[03:58:50] an Enfield sucrose team but like
[03:58:52] who's [ __ ] use Hazel there it's fine
[03:58:53] like the tables usually do well because
[03:58:56] the other characters are really good and
[03:58:57] then his is okay
[03:59:09] I will unbench my Hazel don't worry
[03:59:12] it'll happen
[03:59:21] nowhere to hide

[04:18:08] you could play ayaka kokomi Causeway
[04:18:10] freeze
[04:18:11] or what I genuinely recommend
[04:18:15] and what I think is probably better is
[04:18:17] just [ __ ] Beto dude beta is so
[04:18:20] [ __ ] good you have her C6 you have a
[04:18:22] R4 service mind you're not using
[04:18:25] our Forester is fine level [ __ ] 40.
[04:18:31] go Beto official kazua dendro or you
[04:18:35] don't even need like you can swap the
[04:18:37] team around but you have a dendro healer
[04:18:39] or shielder do you have Yahoo you do you
[04:18:42] could do Yaya there and then Nikita
[04:18:44] second off boom you keep your Nikita for
[04:18:46] a second off and then boom Beto yao yao
[04:18:49] official for example wait no Sue gross
[04:18:51] not Cosmo I said cause I meant to say
[04:18:52] sucrose because you want to Auto attack
[04:18:54] on that team so Chris is better wow I
[04:18:55] thought cos was always better see ratio
[04:18:57] that's why you need my video [ __ ] you so
[04:18:59] your gross is better there oh [ __ ] but
[04:19:01] she's also C4
[04:19:02] thanks
[04:19:04] um
[04:19:05] you can also do different [ __ ] you could
[04:19:07] do like
[04:19:11] you could do xiaofars on Bennett you
[04:19:14] could do uh
[04:19:16] ayaka kokomi kazua Flex well cryo
[04:19:22] today
[04:19:26] uh your second half is what matters the
[04:19:28] most for 12 but you said 12 threes what
[04:19:30] you're struggling with so 12 3 first
[04:19:32] half is harder so if you already have
[04:19:33] three stars for 12 one until two for 12
[04:19:35] like 12 throughout focus on the first
[04:19:36] half which is where I either use freeze
[04:19:39] or my personal favorite which is Beto or
[04:19:43] Xiao can also work but you have to make
[04:19:44] sure you're grouping them like if
[04:19:45] Charles punches are always hitting both
[04:19:47] consecrated beasts he's good if you're
[04:19:48] [ __ ] it up and you're only thinking
[04:19:49] one is bad
[04:19:51] but videos that strong yes so Beto
[04:19:53] against two enemies specifically is like
[04:19:56] really really really good okay in
[04:19:58] general she's good but especially
[04:19:59] against enemies
[04:20:00] like her scaling is
[04:20:03] Beto ziox
[04:20:11] IDE yeah mute that [ __ ] idiot I don't
[04:20:12] hear that guy talk
[04:20:14] uh
[04:20:15] uh is it in this video or the other
[04:20:17] video where'd I show this killing
[04:20:20] I think it's the newer one oh wait there
[04:20:21] it is
[04:20:25] C2
[04:20:29] two Targets
[04:20:31] what are the max discharges
[04:20:34] C2 12 discharges total damage 12 000 12.
[04:20:43] 12 240 percent
[04:20:48] sorry
[04:20:51] I can't read for a second
[04:20:53] anyways it's a lot it's a lot
[04:20:57] it's a big number
[04:21:01] kitchen is very I mean beta is very good
[04:21:02] against two enemies
[04:21:09] so
[04:21:12] like it depends like if you have like a
[04:21:14] super invested like ayaka or Xiao or
[04:21:16] Chang Ling or well shanglia would use
[04:21:18] second off uh like I I like you kind of
[04:21:21] keep you keep
[04:21:24] for your second half on that team and
[04:21:26] then you can do like sing show boom
[04:21:30] you say Beto's good but never player I
[04:21:32] did I did a four star clear four star
[04:21:34] characters four star weapons we use Beto
[04:21:36] we cleared it
[04:21:38] wow zox
[04:21:41] I also say Vermillion is bad and I do it
[04:21:44] right away now I'm not gonna do the
[04:21:46] domain today my main extreme
[04:21:50] [Music]
[04:22:01] Minnie there's OverWatch
[04:22:06] important question on a scale from one
[04:22:08] to ten how gay are Al Haytham and Carvey
[04:22:16] uh
[04:22:23] what if okay what if one's a 10 and then
[04:22:25] the others are five but he doesn't want
[04:22:27] to pay rent or like he wants to pay like
[04:22:29] half like he doesn't want to like live
[04:22:31] alone
[04:22:36] he's like fine I'll tolerate you
[04:22:39] it's like
[04:22:48] I'm coming
[04:23:10] foreign
[04:23:18] we'll do four more runs
[04:23:21] four more runs where are they yeah the
[04:23:23] music stopped
[04:23:24] that's why I feel empty I don't want to
[04:23:26] listen to
[04:23:36] no try you already had your power music
[04:23:38] today
[04:23:39] we're scaring the new Frogs
[04:23:48] you don't want to play The Pirate Song
[04:23:49] while playing Beto because 66 more
[04:23:51] damage that's actually true actually
[04:23:53] true
[04:24:01] nowhere to hide
[04:24:03] arguably the best c0 hyper carry without
[04:24:06] a signature weapon best c0r0 on
[04:24:09] ironically
[04:24:11] like it's not like always true but his
[04:24:13] team damage is really high so midnight
[04:24:15] fantasma he can kind of get carried like
[04:24:18] he does pretty good damage but he can
[04:24:20] kind of get carried from his team too
[04:24:22] because he has like you can run him like
[04:24:23] hyperbloom or quick bloom pretty good
[04:24:31] the [ __ ] is this
[04:24:33] though
[04:24:47] is it really hyper carry if others are
[04:24:48] doing damage yes like no like yes he
[04:24:52] like he builds and plays the same as a
[04:24:54] normal hyper carry but his team also
[04:24:57] does a [ __ ] ton of damage so that's good
[04:24:59] because it means
[04:25:00] it's like
[04:25:02] he has really good personal damage too
[04:25:04] but it's not all him so also his
[04:25:06] teammates like do a lot
[04:25:11] seems like an emergency
[04:25:18] and a lot of hyper carries kinda
[04:25:22] are dependent or like a lot of hyper
[04:25:24] carries are like okay like okay that's
[04:25:26] zero like okay but
[04:25:29] there's like almost always better
[04:25:31] options but then with like their C2 or
[04:25:33] their signature weapon they get a lot
[04:25:34] better
[04:25:36] I think Xiao doesn't equalizations but
[04:25:38] he kind of wants the signature weapon
[04:25:39] it's pretty big for him or like a C6
[04:25:42] bars on or like Bennett and then like
[04:25:44] whatever whatever
[04:25:46] but um I'll hide them kind of doesn't
[04:25:48] need [ __ ]
[04:26:19] needs Electro that show is so dominant
[04:26:22] pretend I didn't read it
[04:26:43] call me depends on your teams I always
[04:26:45] advocate for supports over dps's but I
[04:26:47] like those are really good DPS so if you
[04:26:48] need a DPS get them but if you don't
[04:26:50] just get good supports
[04:26:56] foreign
[04:27:35] all right
[04:27:43] what is that coffee pasta
[04:27:51] yeah the shot of Cafe's butt was pretty
[04:27:53] noticeable
[04:27:55] they gave him good form but it's not
[04:27:57] like
[04:27:57] the size isn't considerable does that
[04:28:00] make sense that's like cab ATC anyways I
[04:28:03] have like no more energy so what I'm
[04:28:06] gonna do is I think the content stream
