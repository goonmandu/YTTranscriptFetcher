[00:18:41] it's not Noel because we already I'm
[00:18:43] pretty sure we already like no all those
[00:18:44] two days ago they wouldn't recycle her
[00:18:46] surely right waiting for Elden ring

[00:19:04] I mean I could be wrong but
[00:19:05] oh wait it was Geo I'm so smart I mean
[00:19:08] okay I didn't get it but I knew it was
[00:19:10] Joe I knew his [ __ ] Geo I could tell
[00:19:12] there was like recrystallizations being
[00:19:15] happening
[00:19:16] so not bad I just I couldn't because
[00:19:19] like dude look at how inverted this [ __ ]
[00:19:20] was yeah like I could tell this was a
[00:19:23] crystal but it looked like a shield

[00:19:33] Alden ring is never coming sag [ __ ] you
[00:19:40] Brandon is in 90 months
[00:19:42] Elden ring will come at some point
[00:19:45] at some point
[00:19:52] LeBron is a pun
[00:19:57] um
[00:19:58] okay we have a lot to do
[00:20:00] I don't know if before I do what I want
[00:20:03] to do
[00:20:05] I should talk about something maybe I
[00:20:07] should it's not like imported but I do
[00:20:09] want to talk about it because I can't
[00:20:10] live in silence
[00:20:13] I like anything that's on my mind I have
[00:20:14] to scream about it because that's just
[00:20:15] who I am as a person unfortunate
[00:20:17] I skipped to watch you let's go
[00:20:25] wait you skipped what to watch me sleep
[00:20:28] go sleep it's a four months life is
[00:20:30] better
[00:20:31] concern no it's nothing it's nothing
[00:20:33] concerning
[00:20:35] it's nothing it's nothing serious it's
[00:20:36] not it's not serious
[00:20:38] well it's serious to me
[00:20:40] because it concerns me not as a person
[00:20:43] but it concerns a video I made and I
[00:20:45] value my videos so I want to talk about
[00:20:48] it
[00:20:48] Okay so
[00:21:00] let me pull it up
[00:21:11] foreign
[00:21:38] okay music go quiet
[00:21:41] okay
[00:21:43] so before we start playing caption
[00:21:46] there is one thing I want to talk about
[00:21:48] regarding a stereo video I made which
[00:21:51] was good for the record but there's a
[00:21:54] few things I want to add onto it to talk
[00:21:57] about it so in one point
[00:22:00] three no one point three is that hung
[00:22:02] we're gonna do that in 1.2 there were
[00:22:04] two videos two characters that came out
[00:22:07] two guys that I made I made a blade one
[00:22:09] I make half go one
[00:22:11] blade one amazing perfect calf going the
[00:22:14] main thing that I uh emphasized on when
[00:22:17] it first came out was
[00:22:19] you know this is the best build all that
[00:22:21] I could have emphasized that crit Kafka
[00:22:23] is well not recommended well you know
[00:22:25] requires more investment specific
[00:22:27] supports that you probably don't have I
[00:22:29] probably should emphasize a little bit
[00:22:30] more fair enough I pinned a comment
[00:22:31] about it all good but fair enough
[00:22:34] however
[00:22:35] and I am not going to call out this
[00:22:37] person because I don't want to send any
[00:22:40] hate their way so if you see them be
[00:22:42] nice to them don't say anything shut the
[00:22:43] [ __ ] up thank you however
[00:22:47] I do have to talk about this
[00:22:50] because it tilted me so we're gonna talk
[00:22:52] about it and not just like it tells me
[00:22:54] but also I value giving good information
[00:22:56] so if I'm ever like oh [ __ ] I [ __ ] up
[00:22:58] I want to be like oh my bad here's how I
[00:23:00] correct it noted for the future pin a
[00:23:03] comment about it we're jealous and for
[00:23:04] the like despite me personally hating
[00:23:07] Krit Kafka I still put it in the pin
[00:23:09] comment I like I wrote well I can read
[00:23:11] more here I wrote like you know here's
[00:23:13] why I don't really like it but here's
[00:23:14] why it can be good no no no no there you
[00:23:16] go
[00:23:17] so here is the thing that I want to talk
[00:23:19] about I noticed not through me but
[00:23:21] through a friend that someone who again
[00:23:24] don't be don't be mean to them don't do
[00:23:27] anything be normal
[00:23:28] was mad at me
[00:23:30] because someone commented on their video
[00:23:32] that at E1 you need 66.7 hit rate or 67
[00:23:37] for a E1 Kafka which
[00:23:39] is true to guarantee her dot the new one
[00:23:43] you get from either her signature like
[00:23:44] cone or her Yuan but isn't true if
[00:23:46] you're going full optimal because you
[00:23:48] don't need that much hit rate going
[00:23:50] attack would be a bit more efficient
[00:23:51] true and I even checked with like Kafka
[00:23:55] like subreddit and like Discord like
[00:23:57] just I didn't ask them but I just like
[00:23:58] looked through their document and like
[00:23:59] those numbers are true so
[00:24:01] but
[00:24:02] I do wanna uh talk about one thing so
[00:24:05] for if they're only so what this person
[00:24:08] did is say that
[00:24:09] basically my guys are dog [ __ ] because
[00:24:11] so Jeff didn't help me with this which I
[00:24:13] loves Jeff and I think he's smarter than
[00:24:14] me so fair however
[00:24:17] in the gadget videos two things for the
[00:24:19] gungeon videos I basically do it all
[00:24:22] then I'll at the end I'll be like if I
[00:24:24] need a weapon ranking I'll ask him to do
[00:24:26] the math for it
[00:24:27] to make sure it's good and stuff there's
[00:24:28] a [ __ ] like the thing also is like back
[00:24:30] in the day there was like no good
[00:24:32] resources for kitchen practically but
[00:24:35] like more and more there's so many that
[00:24:36] like
[00:24:37] there's like kitchen Mains there's other
[00:24:39] Theory Crafters there's streamers even
[00:24:41] jstor there's like a bunch of like
[00:24:42] really good resources so it's like it's
[00:24:44] not like I'm like oh I need this math to
[00:24:47] do whatever it's just like now there's
[00:24:48] so much more knowledge it's like I want
[00:24:49] to make it as detailed as possible but
[00:24:51] [ __ ] enter we're not talking about that
[00:24:52] now for this video the main thing I
[00:24:55] [ __ ] up on
[00:24:56] was or okay what the peelers or the one
[00:24:58] person was saying was hey this this
[00:25:01] guide maker is terrible no no because
[00:25:05] they said you want 66.7 or 67 hit rate
[00:25:08] for an E1 Kafka or S1 Kafka because
[00:25:10] someone in their comments said that and
[00:25:12] while I do want to admit my wrongdoing
[00:25:16] and that it is the right number for 100
[00:25:17] while I do want to admit that I could
[00:25:19] have emphasized hey
[00:25:21] attack percent will still be more
[00:25:22] optimal
[00:25:23] not only is this only for E1 and for the
[00:25:25] rest of the video it was accurate but
[00:25:27] also I do want to say that even for that
[00:25:29] part
[00:25:30] I included two things so I think the
[00:25:32] editing here [ __ ] it up because I
[00:25:33] didn't say you need this much per se and
[00:25:35] I think the editing kind of [ __ ] me
[00:25:37] over but I because look there's two
[00:25:39] things one there's a note here that says
[00:25:40] a bit less is still okay though as you'd
[00:25:41] build more attack instead two it's in a
[00:25:43] pin comment three also when I talk about
[00:25:46] eidolons I said and now not to defend
[00:25:49] myself because I should have emphasized
[00:25:50] this better but also I said raid on your
[00:25:53] sub stats or even a main stat becomes
[00:25:55] much more viable do note though that you
[00:25:56] trigger your follow-up attack quite a
[00:25:58] lot as your allies are attacking so it's
[00:26:00] okay if you don't have a hundred percent
[00:26:02] chance that this wow he said it's okay
[00:26:04] if you don't have 100 chats so basically
[00:26:05] I'm saying hey it's okay if you know I'm
[00:26:07] [ __ ] 66. now
[00:26:09] in my
[00:26:11] offense not defense I should have been
[00:26:13] like you know what you don't need that
[00:26:15] much you could go 20 40 whatever like go
[00:26:17] sub stats you're chilling don't
[00:26:18] sacrifice too much talk
[00:26:20] sure
[00:26:21] with that in mind
[00:26:22] I basically because like
[00:26:26] I
[00:26:27] I
[00:26:28] my like thinking was okay e0 this is how
[00:26:31] much you need and that was true although
[00:26:33] I think I said like
[00:26:35] uh wait what was the exact number 28
[00:26:37] yeah 28 it's the exact numbers 20.7
[00:26:40] which rounds 29 but still the same
[00:26:41] substance because you get 18 for free so
[00:26:43] it's just 10 which is like two to three
[00:26:44] Subs it doesn't matter point is that
[00:26:46] this is all fine the only thing I got
[00:26:47] criticized on was the E1 run right and
[00:26:49] that's fair however
[00:26:51] I I should have specified a bit more but
[00:26:53] even in it I did include a note like
[00:26:55] it's mostly like the sub the
[00:26:57] the editing that kind of [ __ ] me over
[00:26:59] which is my fault because that's on me
[00:27:01] but like I basically was also saying
[00:27:03] like Yo dude if you have less that's
[00:27:04] fine but the way I was thinking about it
[00:27:05] when making it is like I'm gonna give
[00:27:07] how much you need for Max hit rate
[00:27:10] if you want to guarantee it because
[00:27:11] these are like the right numbers
[00:27:14] now
[00:27:16] what I want to say is the following
[00:27:20] this person again
[00:27:22] I'm not going to say a name and don't be
[00:27:24] mean to them and don't be stupid but
[00:27:27] this person basically said because one
[00:27:31] of the reviewers said that you need 67
[00:27:33] hit rate for E1 and signature like on
[00:27:35] which is true for 100 but isn't true if
[00:27:38] you're just like you want like a decent
[00:27:40] like 80 chance 90 70 like whatever right
[00:27:42] because you can hit multiple times it's
[00:27:43] not a big deal
[00:27:45] because of that
[00:27:47] terrible guide maker no credibility the
[00:27:49] only good for gention dependent on other
[00:27:51] people
[00:27:53] and like also said okay also
[00:27:57] I believe that I haven't made like a
[00:27:59] major mistake like major mistake since
[00:28:02] like like I've made mistakes a lot but
[00:28:04] if I made a major one since like Albedo
[00:28:05] which was like two years ago through
[00:28:07] almost no two years ago and like back
[00:28:09] then Not only was I dumb but also like
[00:28:15] the resources available to the gentian
[00:28:18] community on top of like Theory where
[00:28:19] Theory crafting was and just everything
[00:28:20] was a lot worse now there's so many
[00:28:24] resources I know a lot more about the
[00:28:25] game to where just playing a character
[00:28:27] testing character myself I basically can
[00:28:29] know everything and then I can check
[00:28:30] with other people I can ask I can see
[00:28:32] what other people doing and now there's
[00:28:33] a [ __ ] resources
[00:28:34] with that in mind now it's just like
[00:28:39] this person was like oh yeah his old
[00:28:41] videos were bad
[00:28:42] because like he didn't have math from
[00:28:45] Jeff which like first of all I did
[00:28:47] second of all the Jeff is the best and
[00:28:48] he would never do anything wrong and I
[00:28:49] love the Jeff but third of all it's like
[00:28:52] where we are now is there's so many more
[00:28:56] resources and so much of everything to
[00:28:58] where there's so much more knowledge out
[00:29:00] that it's like a lot easier
[00:29:03] it's not easier but it's like well it is
[00:29:05] easier like knowledge is a lot more like
[00:29:06] widespread and like available so it's
[00:29:08] like
[00:29:10] if in 1.0
[00:29:12] people thought child was like bad or or
[00:29:16] or good because he could like unless
[00:29:18] they build up like I was like child is
[00:29:20] good but I didn't know oh [ __ ] child is
[00:29:22] good because strangling is the best
[00:29:23] [ __ ] unit it was just like
[00:29:25] child is good
[00:29:27] anyways my point is because someone said
[00:29:29] can you make your point my point is
[00:29:32] but
[00:29:34] mother okay I'm gonna be nice
[00:29:36] respectfully
[00:29:38] this [ __ ] respectfully
[00:29:40] was like
[00:29:42] oh yeah
[00:29:44] don't watch this person all of his [ __ ]
[00:29:46] is bad because someone commented that
[00:29:48] you need this amount which is the
[00:29:50] correct amount to guarantee the
[00:29:53] implantation or like not implantation
[00:29:54] whatever the word is the debuff even
[00:29:56] though it's not like you can get away
[00:29:57] with less and you should get away with
[00:29:59] less as I did mention once but I should
[00:30:00] have emphasized more
[00:30:02] on their video
[00:30:05] so it kind of hurt me because I'm like
[00:30:07] why and like and I was like okay it's
[00:30:09] not like a big thing I was like 2K likes
[00:30:11] but like it kind of hurts me that it's
[00:30:13] like I don't want people to think like
[00:30:16] if my credibility is bad if I make a
[00:30:18] mistake I want to be like my bad and for
[00:30:20] this I'm saying I wish I had a bit more
[00:30:22] time I wish I could have said hey you
[00:30:24] know what you can get away with like 20
[00:30:25] 40 whatever and like for most calculus
[00:30:27] for the e0 I'm literally saying hey
[00:30:29] you'll need like 10 on your [ __ ] subs
[00:30:30] and like that's fully accurate and
[00:30:32] everything else amazing chef's kiss but
[00:30:35] dude there's no way this made a like
[00:30:39] small village of people be like yeah
[00:30:41] this guy's terrible
[00:30:43] dude what
[00:30:45] what it's fine it's okay
[00:30:47] but I just have to talk about it because
[00:30:49] um it's not a big deal especially if I
[00:30:51] ignore it like people don't know about
[00:30:53] it like there's more people hearing
[00:30:54] about it on my stream than people that
[00:30:56] would hear about it if I don't talk
[00:30:56] about it so it's not like it's like
[00:30:58] helping me to talk about it it's just
[00:31:00] I don't like when if I make a mistake I
[00:31:04] want someone to tell me like I look
[00:31:06] through comments extensively for Lynette
[00:31:09] okay Lynette guide great but one thing I
[00:31:12] I messed up is I said the correct
[00:31:14] infusion priority but what I didn't
[00:31:16] immediately like what I should have just
[00:31:18] added is oh by the way this infusion
[00:31:20] priority is only for Lynette other
[00:31:22] characters have a different infusion
[00:31:23] priority I don't know where I put it
[00:31:24] it's somewhere in the video but yeah and
[00:31:26] someone commented that I'm like oh like
[00:31:27] see someone commented that here I was
[00:31:29] like oh thanks so much and then I just
[00:31:30] like
[00:31:31] you know
[00:31:33] um I think I said same as always and I
[00:31:34] just trimmed that out in the YouTube
[00:31:35] video so like it's not even there
[00:31:36] anymore and all good so like yeah there
[00:31:39] you go so we're chilling but like
[00:31:41] if
[00:31:43] this
[00:31:44] which only applies to an e0 or an S1
[00:31:46] Kafka
[00:31:48] where I always have well I also have me
[00:31:50] writing like so this is what editor
[00:31:52] wrote okay I told him what to write so
[00:31:54] I'm taking the blame entirely I'm not
[00:31:55] playing someone else but the like
[00:31:57] different font is me going through it
[00:31:59] again right before uploading like a day
[00:32:00] later I added like less is okay I could
[00:32:03] have I should have recorded a sentence
[00:32:04] because I kind of wanted to say you
[00:32:06] don't need this much hit rate but this
[00:32:08] is how much you need if you want 100
[00:32:10] chance which is true that's fully
[00:32:12] accurate but you know I'm a bit less and
[00:32:15] that's fine and it's probably better it
[00:32:17] is better it have a bit less
[00:32:21] but if this is enough for them to attack
[00:32:23] me and everything I've done dude what is
[00:32:27] wrong with you [ __ ] touch grass cause
[00:32:30] like look again if I do something wrong
[00:32:32] my bad I'll fix it I'll do better like I
[00:32:35] want to know what I do wrong but it's
[00:32:36] like knowing this is the breaking point
[00:32:39] also as I said main stat becomes much
[00:32:42] more viable I said hitter rate becomes
[00:32:43] much Revival much more viable and then
[00:32:45] do note though that you trigger your
[00:32:46] follow-up attack quite a lot because
[00:32:48] your allies are attacking yeah it's okay
[00:32:49] if you don't have a hundred percent
[00:32:51] chance that's true now could I have
[00:32:53] added a sentence hey like you know no no
[00:32:55] no you don't need them yes but it's also
[00:32:57] 23 minutes and I'm like [ __ ] No One's
[00:32:59] Gonna click on this video if it's longer
[00:33:00] which I was like with like [ __ ] Lenny
[00:33:02] too where it's like 28 like
[00:33:03] I actually added more but it's also like
[00:33:05] dude why you can say that you can be
[00:33:08] like hey by the way you need 40 like
[00:33:11] okay my point isn't okay because I see
[00:33:13] villain chat misunderstanding this my
[00:33:15] point isn't that I was right that's not
[00:33:16] my point it's I should do better
[00:33:19] but it's like the smallest thing to wear
[00:33:22] okay noted for the future I'll still say
[00:33:25] what's the correct hit rate how much do
[00:33:27] you actually need for 100 but I'll also
[00:33:29] mention that hey sometimes you don't
[00:33:30] need 100 sometimes 80 is fine 70 like
[00:33:32] it's okay to have less because attack
[00:33:33] can be more valuable it's not like what
[00:33:35] I said was wrong it was I should have
[00:33:36] added something else because it could
[00:33:38] infer it could mislead viewers into
[00:33:40] building more history than they need
[00:33:42] even though that's the correct amount to
[00:33:44] guarantee it
[00:33:46] but it's like dude know what you're
[00:33:48] taking that and attacking all of me and
[00:33:51] it's like then they're like oh yeah it's
[00:33:52] because
[00:33:53] I don't know it tilted me and also they
[00:33:54] were like talking about the Jeff and
[00:33:55] then they misspelled oh my God that
[00:33:57] tilted me so I don't know why that upset
[00:33:58] me the thing that upset me the most is
[00:34:00] they were like
[00:34:01] like basically okay and I love the draft
[00:34:03] but this is they were talking about like
[00:34:05] how oh yeah like it's a Jeff math which
[00:34:07] is amazing so don't know that's great
[00:34:08] but then the the spell to Jeff with two
[00:34:10] F's
[00:34:11] if if do you
[00:34:13] so because the way they said it was like
[00:34:15] they liked the draft but they don't know
[00:34:16] how to spell his name so clearly you
[00:34:18] don't watch him either so you're just
[00:34:19] here to [ __ ] on both of us
[00:34:23] what are you doing whatever it's fine
[00:34:32] people being nitpicky for no reason no I
[00:34:34] so that okay here's the thing I
[00:34:37] appreciate it when people tell me if I
[00:34:39] could add a bit of clarity to my video
[00:34:41] or if there's something I messed up or
[00:34:42] if like I appreciate that I'm not saying
[00:34:44] it's bad but I don't like if they will
[00:34:47] take it as like
[00:34:48] everything you've ever done is bad don't
[00:34:50] watch this guy's videos because it
[00:34:52] wasn't even a mistake it was
[00:34:54] because there was like a bit of
[00:34:57] something that I could have said better
[00:34:58] so that it wasn't misleading basically
[00:35:01] and I do think my biggest like the thing
[00:35:04] I wish I did better in this video was I
[00:35:05] should have talked about Craig Kafka
[00:35:06] more I don't think it's good I don't
[00:35:08] think you should use it but the calc say
[00:35:10] hey it's not that far behind it's fine
[00:35:12] no no I should have mentioned it in case
[00:35:14] people want to play it but this is not
[00:35:16] the hill to die on like this is not the
[00:35:18] [ __ ] [ __ ] to start like
[00:35:21] it's fine
[00:35:22] all good
[00:35:24] who's he talking about doesn't matter
[00:35:26] don't [ __ ] harass someone don't look
[00:35:27] them up don't it doesn't matter it
[00:35:29] doesn't be nice like I'm not trying to
[00:35:30] like call someone out I'm just saying I
[00:35:33] saw this
[00:35:35] it upset me because I hope people don't
[00:35:36] think that way in general and also of me
[00:35:39] so I want to talk about it but it's not
[00:35:40] about that person
[00:35:42] um
[00:35:43] yeah that's all
[00:35:45] criticism shouldn't be toxic yeah
[00:35:46] exactly like
[00:35:48] I mean when I made a child video like
[00:35:51] two years ago now a year and a half like
[00:35:52] I [ __ ] up my Global swirl and someone
[00:35:54] mentioned oh you [ __ ] up the girls
[00:35:55] well no no I was like oh thank you and
[00:35:57] then I trim that out of the video and I
[00:35:58] pinned a comment showing a good rotation
[00:35:59] that is something that I [ __ ] up and
[00:36:02] like oh [ __ ] like because I thought it
[00:36:03] was on the exclamation mark or like the
[00:36:05] yeah it was a bit after like now I know
[00:36:07] how to [ __ ] go through I [ __ ] it up
[00:36:08] all good but like I should have done
[00:36:10] better like not all good like I should
[00:36:11] show that better but then what I did was
[00:36:12] like I try to add a note saying yo just
[00:36:14] check this this and then I showed a good
[00:36:15] rotation and like that was very nice of
[00:36:17] them the person that was like Hey like
[00:36:19] I'm a child whatever showed how to do it
[00:36:21] I'm like I really appreciate that thank
[00:36:22] you but if you take like a it wasn't
[00:36:25] even like it was a comment saying zyoc
[00:36:28] said this it wasn't even
[00:36:32] we can move on but I hope that this
[00:36:36] um
[00:36:38] can be seen or clipped by the people who
[00:36:41] need no don't send it to anyone that's
[00:36:42] what I'm saying I want to be careful
[00:36:43] with my words I'm just saying I hope
[00:36:45] that this explains it to the people that
[00:36:47] need it to be explained
[00:36:50] that's all
[00:36:54] like this can be clipped into a video
[00:36:55] but I don't want to be sent to someone I
[00:36:57] don't feel like oh watch this like shut
[00:36:58] up
[00:37:00] bro breathe
[00:37:04] so the corners of full context anyways
[00:37:06] well I don't know what it was like I
[00:37:07] didn't dive into it that's why I'm not
[00:37:08] bringing it up or being specific but
[00:37:09] it's like
[00:37:10] I don't know I think it's just weird
[00:37:11] because it's also like
[00:37:15] like okay let's say I like actively [ __ ]
[00:37:19] up let's say I'm like yo build this and
[00:37:22] it's wrong
[00:37:24] I wouldn't want that I would pin a
[00:37:25] comment I would edit it out I would
[00:37:27] remake the like I don't want that but
[00:37:28] it's like it was something so minor
[00:37:31] that wasn't even wrong it was just
[00:37:36] with a note adding context but I should
[00:37:38] have emphasized it in the audio with
[00:37:40] this I should have talked about it more
[00:37:41] yo J Stern it's the Rain Man Big Ben
[00:37:45] but yeah I mean that's all
[00:37:48] and then uh we're pausing today
[00:38:02] beware of drama bait I mean maybe I just
[00:38:05] because I I mean I've talked about this
[00:38:07] a lot right where it's like I value
[00:38:10] credibility so if I make a mistake I
[00:38:12] want people to tell me and I want to
[00:38:13] correct it but I don't want it to be
[00:38:15] like
[00:38:16] oh this slight thing wasn't even wrong
[00:38:18] it was misleading
[00:38:20] and a commenter understood it
[00:38:22] differently or whatever so you're
[00:38:23] terrible and everything you've ever done
[00:38:24] is terrible it's like dude just tell me
[00:38:26] like what the [ __ ] like if in my Lenny
[00:38:28] video I'm like I mean I'm pretty sure my
[00:38:30] video I was like good I don't think I
[00:38:31] made a single like [ __ ] up but like even
[00:38:33] did I put a comment no not yet I mean
[00:38:34] maybe there's not like you know like I'm
[00:38:36] always looking but like let's say let's
[00:38:38] say in my video like I don't know I say
[00:38:40] yeah shanglings worse than [ __ ] I
[00:38:43] don't know like Daya and then I'm like
[00:38:44] okay that's kind of wrong and then I'd
[00:38:46] explain it but would you really be like
[00:38:48] oh actually Zach said Chinese bad so
[00:38:50] he's terrible it's like dude
[00:38:56] actually the one thing I talked about
[00:38:57] with the Jeff about uh Lenny because
[00:39:00] like we didn't really talk about it much
[00:39:02] like I just kind of made this video uh
[00:39:03] he did a weapon ranking big shout out to
[00:39:05] him but the rest like I basically did
[00:39:07] um for the most part on my own the only
[00:39:09] I did talked about was I liked DEA or
[00:39:11] Dia teams with Lenny and he's like I
[00:39:13] [ __ ] hate I think he likes her like I
[00:39:16] think she's his favorite sumeru
[00:39:18] character but he was like yeah they are
[00:39:22] just Easter bed enough time Easter kazoo
[00:39:23] up time you have to either use her at
[00:39:25] the start and then she does nothing or
[00:39:26] he's there at the end I'm like yeah
[00:39:27] that's true but I'm happy that you can
[00:39:29] [ __ ] use her for once so it's like
[00:39:30] yeah yeah cause he's just better or yeah
[00:39:33] Causeway changlings better or the
[00:39:35] [ __ ] or whatever
[00:39:38] but like did you can use it okay you
[00:39:40] could use her and it makes me happy it
[00:39:42] warms my heart
[00:39:45] that's enough for the registered
[00:39:47] thanks all the subs but yeah that's all
[00:39:52] copium well
[00:39:55] I think it is her burst uh her best team
[00:39:57] the best place you can use her even
[00:40:00] though it's bad for like it's not no
[00:40:02] it's not bad it's just not the best
[00:40:03] option like yeah what do you think crit
[00:40:05] Kafka is good oh why don't you think
[00:40:07] your cat feels good okay let me be I
[00:40:09] guess I'll clarify in case you people
[00:40:10] actually Wonder okay I don't think crew
[00:40:12] Kafka is bad I just because it's worse
[00:40:14] than D.O.T
[00:40:17] how to explain this
[00:40:22] in my very biased opinion
[00:40:28] in my very biased I'm gonna say my
[00:40:29] non-biased opinion I'm gonna say my
[00:40:31] biased opinion in my very biased opinion
[00:40:33] it kills a unique character and makes
[00:40:35] her a generic carry that you build like
[00:40:37] every other carry and play like every
[00:40:39] other carry and just yeah yeah and just
[00:40:42] crit build like any character ever
[00:40:46] but
[00:40:47] and it's worse and it's worse than Dot
[00:40:50] and it requires higher investment as
[00:40:51] someone said I yeah we're like all of
[00:40:54] that but in a non-biased way I didn't
[00:40:56] mention it but I should have said that
[00:40:57] it's better than I said it was yeah like
[00:40:59] you know you can do it if you want if
[00:41:01] you have a spare brania which if you
[00:41:02] have a spare bra on your user on your
[00:41:03] other team like there there might be
[00:41:05] scenarios like oh what if I play Genuine
[00:41:07] and I have Ting Yoon and [ __ ] silver
[00:41:08] like whatever but like
[00:41:11] you probably aren't like I have spare
[00:41:12] brawnia Ting you and they're not being
[00:41:13] used like like maybe and like I should
[00:41:16] have in an office but I should have been
[00:41:17] like yeah like you could use if you are
[00:41:19] but it's like I kinda
[00:41:22] it's still worse and it still kills
[00:41:24] everything that I like about the
[00:41:25] character and I don't recommend it but
[00:41:28] in my opinion
[00:41:30] it is better than I thought it was
[00:41:35] oh and also it requires very high value
[00:41:37] supports whereas DLT build requires
[00:41:40] literally random idiots oh [ __ ]
[00:41:43] sample or Luca and then a [ __ ] the
[00:41:45] Hillary character that I have lying
[00:41:46] around because you get like 64. or like
[00:41:48] Asta or [ __ ] random healer you're
[00:41:50] good it's like you literally just Chuck
[00:41:51] a bunch of random [ __ ] idiots in a
[00:41:53] team and it works and it's like so much
[00:41:55] easier than like [ __ ] I need brawnia
[00:41:57] Ting you and silver wolf like it's like
[00:41:58] I mean yeah
[00:42:00] that's all I I don't think it's bad
[00:42:02] though
[00:42:03] like I'm not here to be like it's bad I
[00:42:05] just I'm not I don't really like it
[00:42:08] but I explained in a pin
[00:42:10] like it works you do if you want
[00:42:16] because it's like
[00:42:17] yeah
[00:42:25] you did the same with crit Causeway no
[00:42:26] one cared uh
[00:42:31] Buffs your team I mean em calls a buster
[00:42:33] team so it is different anyways I
[00:42:35] digress
[00:42:36] um I already talked about the krikaka
[00:42:38] thing in another stream the main thing
[00:42:39] that's like I thought was the hit rate
[00:42:41] stuff but that's all chilling
[00:42:50] for [ __ ] sake move on I'm sorry I'm
[00:42:52] sorry I'm sorry uh I just want to make
[00:42:54] sure I said everything I want to say so
[00:42:55] I don't have to say it again
[00:43:00] is Lynette good to have at ar13
[00:43:03] um
[00:43:08] yeah she's cool yeah she's cool you get
[00:43:12] another
[00:43:13] at AR it's 25 red shot no so
[00:43:25] so LOL
[00:43:26] so enjoy this C1 I guess
[00:43:30] and I'll put a little p
[00:43:42] okay that's all ready ready is there
[00:43:45] anything else
[00:43:47] I don't know that's don't lock me
[00:43:48] because like
[00:43:52] it still knocks me because like
[00:43:56] it wasn't like oh okay stop with this
[00:43:59] still going I'm not gonna look at chat
[00:44:00] it just stung on me because it was like
[00:44:04] I don't want someone
[00:44:08] I don't even know why you know what I
[00:44:10] don't care I actually don't care I
[00:44:11] actually don't care I actually don't
[00:44:12] care I actually don't care I do care I'm
[00:44:13] like this is me denying that I care but
[00:44:15] like
[00:44:16] I don't know why I care
[00:44:17] it's attack on you yeah it was just
[00:44:20] weird I don't know why they would format
[00:44:21] it that way
[00:44:27] also it's like dude like
[00:44:30] it is you don't understand okay maybe
[00:44:32] I'm not gonna be like up on my high
[00:44:34] horse because like I'm a [ __ ] idiot
[00:44:36] but like it is very
[00:44:39] man it isn't difficult to know to have
[00:44:41] knowledge about a character and how to
[00:44:43] build them and how to play them and all
[00:44:44] that but like when I want to make sure
[00:44:46] that a 26 23 28 24 minute video is like
[00:44:52] fully accurate like it's like
[00:44:56] heart
[00:44:58] like that's not an excuse though
[00:45:01] it's not to be like oh well then you can
[00:45:03] just have misinformation like you don't
[00:45:05] want that at all but my point is like if
[00:45:08] there ever is something that I forget
[00:45:10] something that I say that's wrong which
[00:45:12] usually it'll be I forget or usually
[00:45:14] it'll be oh I didn't know this it's
[00:45:16] rarely like flat out wrong sometimes it
[00:45:18] is but it very rarely is
[00:45:21] at least recently but it's like you can
[00:45:23] just point it out you can be like oh by
[00:45:25] the way like well it's not just porn I
[00:45:26] was like let me know like you can be
[00:45:28] serious about it I was like let me know
[00:45:29] like oh by the way like I don't think I
[00:45:31] made a mistaken Beto but like oh like
[00:45:32] you didn't mention Beto snapshots I was
[00:45:34] like oh [ __ ] I should mention that right
[00:45:37] yeah that's all but I did mention that
[00:45:39] for the record
[00:45:49] that ultravis they're just by others
[00:45:51] have said well it was probably like
[00:45:53] comments said that I said this therefore
[00:45:56] I don't know but like yeah
[00:46:04] I'm not like I'm not saying like
[00:46:08] yeah Chad's doing a weird thing right
[00:46:09] now it's like I'm not being like Oh like
[00:46:11] be nice to me like that's what I'm
[00:46:12] saying it's like if I make a mistake
[00:46:13] tell me I make a mistake but don't be
[00:46:15] like
[00:46:16] if it's something that's not even a
[00:46:17] mistake was like slightly I should have
[00:46:18] explained it better which I admit too
[00:46:20] just be like yo you should explain this
[00:46:21] better or like this was wrong because or
[00:46:24] this was misleading because or this was
[00:46:26] right or this whatever the [ __ ] like I
[00:46:28] would have added this like tell me and
[00:46:30] then I'll do something about it don't be
[00:46:31] like this person's everything is bad and
[00:46:34] it's terrible and it's dependent on this
[00:46:35] and that when it's like clearly wrong
[00:46:38] I don't know
[00:46:40] when like literally it's all okay it
[00:46:46] okay the [ __ ] up thing was they didn't
[00:46:48] even say something that like it wasn't
[00:46:50] like oh he misexplained traces oh the
[00:46:52] place I was wrong oh like cones are
[00:46:54] wrong oh build was wrong oh stats it
[00:46:57] literally was just 4e1 and S1 the number
[00:46:59] that I said was correct which is correct
[00:47:01] I should have added yeah it's still
[00:47:03] better to go attack which I [ __ ]
[00:47:05] added a note for but I didn't explain
[00:47:06] like audibly
[00:47:08] and I should have
[00:47:11] okay we're playing Denton um I'm gonna

[00:51:35] intonation on the character uh Xiao it's
[00:51:38] a different intonation than xiao's name
[00:51:39] so it does not mean little a different
[00:51:41] uh yeah that's how the language Works
[00:51:43] sorry you can you can learn about it if
[00:51:44] you want landless pursuit of individual
[00:51:47] immortality will only breed an unending
[00:51:49] multitude of malevolent creatures such
[00:51:52] as the fallacy plagues author so then

[00:52:25] the vastness of the universe the rise
[00:52:28] and fall of One race is a little

[00:52:33] reformed an alliance with the shenzhou
[00:52:36] five Elders descended upon the Mortal
[00:52:38] Realm
[00:52:39] you watch over the place
[00:52:41] [Music]
[00:52:43] permanent system
[00:52:48] where's that home it's ultimately
[00:52:51] becoming the
[00:52:55] [ __ ] what does the permanence's
[00:52:57] Revelation truly signify
[00:52:59] continuous change
[00:53:02] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:53:08] the rise and fall of One race is of

[00:53:37] mortal frailties their heavy burdens
[00:53:40] ultimately becoming the shackles which
[00:53:44] from your perspective what does the

[00:53:48] happening
[00:53:50] as the sun and moon rise and fall the

[00:56:46] [ __ ] frost bear
[00:56:47] holy okay I'm glad we stopped that
[00:56:50] um all right
[00:56:52] it's time
[00:56:56] so
[00:56:57] let's start with our daily commissions
[00:56:59] while I update you guys on the lore so
[00:57:01] yesterday
[00:57:12] yesterday wait someone asked if
[00:57:14] harbinger of Dawn's better than finale
[00:57:16] of the d-probato isn't it finally you
[00:57:17] just [ __ ] attack percent why would it
[00:57:19] be better than [ __ ] harbinger
[00:57:22] there's no way it's better there's
[00:57:23] literally objectively speaking why did I
[00:57:25] say like that this is no [ __ ] way
[00:57:34] depending background music
[00:57:49] Harvard is gonna I hate them if you're
[00:57:51] running Jeong Li because I hide them
[00:57:53] like Albedo it's like easy to keep them
[00:57:55] full HP not like easy easy but like
[00:57:58] you don't stay on them for long and you
[00:58:00] have crystallized Fields if you need it
[00:58:02] but uh I'll hide them it's like you need
[00:58:04] a shield or you can't really keep him
[00:58:06] 90. unless you're just a [ __ ] god at
[00:58:07] dodging but
[00:58:11] why is he doing Subaru comps dude shut
[00:58:13] the [ __ ] up okay we're gonna do that
[00:58:16] it's I didn't choose for the Arkham
[00:58:18] quest to be eight hours long I could
[00:58:21] have done it off stream but you guys
[00:58:22] need to see me do it and I want to do it
[00:58:25] but I need to make sure I can I have
[00:58:28] that type of time
[00:58:39] it's not even that long uh it definitely
[00:58:41] is
[00:58:45] like I have to listen to it I'm not
[00:58:47] gonna be skipping I might skip like the
[00:58:49] boring Parts but like I'm gonna be
[00:58:51] listening to it mostly
[00:58:52] because I've heard it's really good
[00:58:55] the super awkward so far is my favorite
[00:58:58] I think I think that was really good
[00:59:11] I think the Jeff told me he liked it
[00:59:12] better than Inazuma which isn't saying
[00:59:14] much because the Inazuma Arcon Quest was
[00:59:16] kind of a Keck W and less than sumeru
[00:59:18] but I know but a lot of people liked it
[00:59:20] more than sumaru so we'll see
[00:59:29] now I'm gonna play it in English so I
[00:59:31] could like read uh not so I could read
[00:59:33] so I could oh that was [ __ ] stupid
[00:59:34] I'm gonna play it in English that people
[00:59:36] can hear it like I don't want to like
[00:59:38] I don't know
[00:59:51] play it in French if there was French
[00:59:53] voice acting I would do it all in French
[00:59:55] I'm not even kidding if French voice
[00:59:57] acting comes out we'll play in French
[01:00:06] okay
[01:00:07] yes
[01:00:13] dude this commission okay I'm about I'm
[01:00:15] like three seconds away from saying [ __ ]
[01:00:17] this commission and going to farm
[01:00:21] okay cool
[01:00:27] where the [ __ ] is the weasel
[01:00:31] oh my God he was right
[01:00:35] foreign
[01:00:41] do you think I'll get it I'm staring
[01:00:43] directly at lynnette's eyes
[01:00:52] watch this watch watch this watch
[01:00:56] I know which one it is
[01:00:58] it's just that easy one more
[01:01:03] me and Lynette are having a staring
[01:01:05] contest
[01:01:14] like I honestly don't know how he can do
[01:01:18] it so consistently every stream it's
[01:01:20] actually like concerning
[01:01:24] how good is peripheral eyesight is it's
[01:01:26] actually like concerning like if there
[01:01:28] was a difficulty scale Abyss 12 would be
[01:01:30] like let's say a seven or an eight this
[01:01:32] would be like a 10.
[01:01:42] as they are usable instead of a shield
[01:01:44] for you what do you mean for you for oh
[01:01:45] for joy
[01:01:49] I mean
[01:01:55] yeah
[01:01:57] I don't know why
[01:02:02] she steals Vapes oh I guess that could
[01:02:05] happen well it depends
[01:02:07] uh I guess it would depend on what team
[01:02:09] you're playing I don't are you gonna go
[01:02:11] Vape in that team
[01:02:13] I guess you would do like I don't even
[01:02:16] know yeah ideally not
[01:02:20] wait no
[01:02:28] wait no
[01:02:43] oh yeah people were flaming my [ __ ]
[01:02:45] Lynette's wings oh wait are there even
[01:02:46] better ones than default for her also
[01:02:48] I'm warm as [ __ ] I need to change shirts
[01:02:51] I don't know why I'm so warm
[01:02:54] uh
[01:02:59] uh oh I'm on this wait who's on oh it's
[01:03:01] Lenny that's on default yeah but Lenny

[01:03:15] I mean kind of but no this one
[01:03:19] this one matches the sleeves so fair
[01:03:21] enough but this one doesn't [ __ ]
[01:03:23] match this one doesn't match this one
[01:03:25] doesn't match
[01:03:29] now this doesn't matter at all
[01:03:31] I guess KFC ones are yeah okay KFC ones
[01:03:34] are fine
[01:03:34] but the default's pretty good too
[01:03:38] I also use the KFC ones fire fair enough
[01:03:41] wait let's see how it looks let's see
[01:03:43] how it looks
[01:03:44] yes I mean
[01:03:49] kind of like the default I'm not gonna
[01:03:51] lie
[01:03:56] yeah that's the defaults you know the
[01:03:58] only characters I use default wings like
[01:04:00] on purpose is Lenny and [ __ ] where's

[01:04:48] which ones do you use on Scara oh glad
[01:04:51] you asked on my wander I actually use
[01:04:53] the twitch Prime Wings you get well you
[01:04:55] used to be able to get if you subscribed
[01:04:57] with prime you actually didn't subscribe

[01:05:01] account linked to your Twitch to claim
[01:05:03] the gentian impact bundles free loot
[01:05:05] while playing engine on top of being
[01:05:07] able to subscribe to your favorite super

[01:05:10] the Starlet Feast which match wander
[01:05:13] perfectly
[01:05:19] I really like these new wings but I
[01:05:20] swear they match no one like they'll
[01:05:22] probably match like novies or something
[01:05:23] but they're so [ __ ] sick they just

[01:17:06] that's all same with like like yeah
[01:17:16] I personally it's I literally can't
[01:17:20] decide who's my favorite because I like
[01:17:21] all of them like I am not even
[01:17:23] exaggerating fatoui trailer again this
[01:17:27] was one of my the best trailers I've
[01:17:28] seen Ever every single [ __ ] character
[01:17:31] I'm excited for where is the where's the
[01:17:35] where is it
[01:17:37] okay

[01:17:47] the 90 cavitano
[01:17:49] and then this guy with the [ __ ] the
[01:17:51] top hat kind of looks sick because he
[01:17:53] looks he's the only character that's not
[01:17:55] designed like
[01:17:58] I don't know how to explain this like I
[01:17:59] feel like most male models they just
[01:18:01] Chuck on like a husbando bundle and then
[01:18:02] him he's like just some old dude so I
[01:18:04] kind of like it
[01:18:06] yeah I like all of them
[01:18:11] is that like Clara background dude okay
[01:18:14] when I played star rail Beta And I
[01:18:17] streamed it
[01:18:19] I the only five star I got was Clara
[01:18:21] that was the first five star I got from
[01:18:23] like the standard Banner like the
[01:18:24] guaranteed one
[01:18:26] I still don't have Clara on my current
[01:18:27] sir like by the way and when I I got
[01:18:30] Clara I'm like [ __ ] I got it what the
[01:18:32] [ __ ] I just do
[01:18:33] that is I got caught I'm like [ __ ] I got
[01:18:35] a toddler but then I used her and I was
[01:18:37] like what the [ __ ] there's a giant ass
[01:18:38] robot I love this I hope sandron or
[01:18:41] whatever her name is plays like this too
[01:18:43] so I hope
[01:18:44] you get to control a [ __ ] robot that
[01:18:46] would be sick and it would be a sick
[01:18:47] character but we don't know
[01:18:51] wait so that's Android what's her name
[01:18:53] again
[01:18:54] the [ __ ] EP girl what's her name
[01:18:59] oh wait colombina
[01:19:01] wait who the [ __ ] is the the older dude
[01:19:04] the short dude
[01:19:06] Lament
[01:19:07] come on okay cool cool so there's
[01:19:09] colombina Sandra on Pulcinella Piero
[01:19:13] arlaquino
[01:19:15] okay code and then Capitano where's
[01:19:17] Capitano always there
[01:19:18] all right easy
[01:19:20] go wait
[01:19:37] dude Alice Alice okay don't ask how I
[01:19:40] ended up on YouTube shorts but I did and
[01:19:42] I don't know what the context was but
[01:19:43] like at some point they mentioned it was
[01:19:45] like they're talking about characters
[01:19:46] now someone they mentioned Xiao and
[01:19:47] they're like the tallest character in
[01:19:49] genshin and then all of the comments
[01:19:51] were like
[01:19:52] like
[01:19:54] kind of saying true they're like true
[01:19:56] tallest tallest so I'm glad I'm glad
[01:19:58] people finally have come to senses and
[01:20:00] are finally accepting the true tall
[01:20:02] archon
[01:20:03] dude like it's it's not just like
[01:20:06] because dude obviously if you release a
[01:20:08] character who gets better the more you
[01:20:11] play them or in xiao's case gets taller
[01:20:13] with friendship levels constellations
[01:20:15] and crit damage obviously day one day
[01:20:18] two the people who don't play them even
[01:20:20] like after years you don't [ __ ] play
[01:20:21] them you don't level them yeah he's
[01:20:23] gonna seem short yeah so I'm glad that
[01:20:25] people finally can [ __ ] see
[01:20:29] what it's like
[01:20:32] whatever
[01:20:45] oh
[01:20:46] these are two good substance for visual
[01:20:51] hey
[01:20:53] we need a good visual set
[01:20:56] this uh Maybe
[01:20:59] okay I like that I kind of want to roll
[01:21:01] it
[01:21:14] sorry I was all tapped yeah
[01:21:18] when I open my menu Xiao turns bald the
[01:21:21] Jeff seven Keck
[01:21:27] is that the prime
[01:22:02] dude alt swapping is the okay can you
[01:22:06] rewind it
[01:22:12] dude I need to play Child it's been a
[01:22:15] little bit it's been a bit too long I
[01:22:16] need to I need to get back into it
[01:22:21] um this isn't good but we're desperate
[01:22:22] so we're gonna lock it
[01:22:30] also it doesn't even work half the time
[01:22:32] it's so annoying yeah it's so [ __ ]
[01:22:33] annoying dude and the worst part is you
[01:22:35] guys can't even tell that I try to also
[01:22:37] sometimes in the abyss three mango
[01:22:39] kinkies they're about to
[01:22:40] they're about to [ __ ] me up I'm like oh
[01:22:42] let me all SWAP to my kazua for iframes
[01:22:45] and then I just do this and then I die
[01:22:46] and then you guys like oh so bad but I
[01:22:48] have every time I die when I swap it's
[01:22:50] all swapping so I've never made a
[01:22:52] mistake true
[01:22:54] I'm glad we all agree now
[01:23:02] magic start
[01:23:04] how much yardage your beta have like 250
[01:23:07] literally the the more the
[01:23:10] the more the merrier
[01:23:18] Lydia Advanced tech for Lenny players
[01:23:20] that I Loki couldn't fit in the video
[01:23:22] because it's already like 29 minutes
[01:23:23] long and I felt like it was kind of
[01:23:24] common knowledgeable you might not know
[01:23:25] it so okay okay let's say it's like
[01:23:27] ganio or or Lenny right and you're
[01:23:28] charged on it and you want to shoot it
[01:23:29] as soon as the bloom frogs right so it's
[01:23:30] like the second like
[01:23:32] boom boom if you do it like that like
[01:23:33] let's say this is like normal shot you
[01:23:35] shoot there you're actually a bit late
[01:23:37] so what you could do is you could do it
[01:23:38] I might [ __ ] up the timing but you can
[01:23:40] do it as soon as the second ring is like
[01:23:41] about to come and you there's like an
[01:23:43] audio cue a little so like look like
[01:23:44] instead of doing it like like there you
[01:23:46] do it a bit earlier so like
[01:23:49] see I still got it and it was like well
[01:23:51] let me make sure I get it you'll see the
[01:23:52] number change like it's like before it
[01:23:54] actually before you actually get to like
[01:23:56] the spike diffused like the circle so
[01:23:58] like
[01:23:59] look
[01:24:01] like see how it was like a bit before
[01:24:02] maybe you could do it earlier I'm not
[01:24:03] like super tired or not but
[01:24:06] that was too early
[01:24:08] wait let me try to do it earlier
[01:24:10] I think I got that one
[01:24:14] yeah see you can do it like quite a bit
[01:24:15] earlier so there you go
[01:24:24] on your players already know this yeah
[01:24:26] okay true it is a got you thing as well
[01:24:28] but I thought I should say it you know
[01:24:30] you know you never know who's who's
[01:24:31] knowing
[01:24:33] I helped at least one person chat at
[01:24:35] least one person was like wow I can now
[01:24:38] play Lenny
[01:24:55] he's on the roof where is it gonna go
[01:25:05] did you abandon shallow for Lenny listen
[01:25:07] here bucko
[01:25:10] every time there's a new character I'm
[01:25:12] playing people think oh you abandoned
[01:25:14] child oh you don't like I'll hide them
[01:25:15] anymore oh you don't like Sino oh
[01:25:19] I thought first of all I love Xiao and
[01:25:21] nothing will ever change that second of
[01:25:23] all
[01:25:25] because we have no end game the only
[01:25:28] [ __ ] end game is going for friendship
[01:25:30] name cards so I have to play every
[01:25:31] character every time there's a new
[01:25:33] character every time there's a character
[01:25:34] in our friendships alternating games
[01:25:36] because that's our only end game
[01:25:41] I remember the like first year no like
[01:25:43] more than a year of me streaming like
[01:25:45] two years no a year and a half literally
[01:25:47] it was like I don't really care about
[01:25:48] name cards who cares but now it's like I
[01:25:51] mean there's not really much else so
[01:26:04] okay okay oh also
[01:26:09] if if any of you name card deniers
[01:26:13] keep in mind
[01:26:14] let's say we chose not to let's say we
[01:26:17] chose not to get name cards and we
[01:26:18] didn't uh get yellow for Japan right we
[01:26:22] would have missed out
[01:26:23] on this where is it
[01:26:25] look at this count the [ __ ] new ways
[01:26:28] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:26:30] nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
[01:26:45] we got a [ __ ] thumbs up
[01:26:47] got a music note
[01:26:48] this is the true end game what else you
[01:26:50] get
[01:26:56] Woodlands
[01:27:03] oh this is pretty sick Ripple
[01:27:15] thoughts on burning Linny with Yao as a
[01:27:18] Healer
[01:27:19] okay the only response that you can have
[01:27:23] to that is why can it work maybe but why
[01:27:27] because you already have Bennett
[01:27:31] so you don't need another healer and
[01:27:33] then it's like well are you gonna
[01:27:35] replace Bennett for yao yao it's like I
[01:27:37] mean I mean you probably shouldn't the
[01:27:40] only time when I could kind of
[01:27:41] understand it is I feel like you're
[01:27:42] running like baiju but even then it's
[01:27:44] like it's also why because there's
[01:27:46] better options but you can
[01:27:54] are you going to the country concert I
[01:27:56] uh uh I'll see if I can like sneak in
[01:27:58] but I low-key okay I woke up I thought

[01:28:25] yeah I don't know I feel like there's no

[01:28:31] like invites me or something I'll go

[01:30:44] streamer that's another streamer I'm a
[01:30:45] big fan of his you should actually
[01:30:46] subscribe to uh that guy he makes really
[01:30:48] good guides and stuff I really like his
[01:30:50] content so you should go watch him
[01:30:52] um yeah that's not me
[01:30:55] with that said I do answer every
[01:30:57] question read every message uh thank
[01:30:58] every sub every follower every donation
[01:30:59] every bit uh and also
[01:31:04] make no mistakes and I'm never wrong
[01:31:07] anyway you had to watch ajk yet I
[01:31:08] watched half of season one then I
[01:31:09] forgore so I re-watch it now
[01:31:11] and I don't remember [ __ ] but
[01:31:15] yeah we're like halfway through I like
[01:31:16] it
[01:31:28] what
[01:31:32] what
[01:31:37] yeah I heard it gets better too so I'm
[01:31:39] excited
[01:31:46] pure character I don't know yet
[01:31:48] if I toggle it what I I'm not gonna
[01:31:51] spoil anything I like um
[01:31:54] so far like the 7-3 dude whatever his
[01:31:56] name is I like him a lot
[01:32:22] [Music]
[01:32:23] Mr socks will you be doing an updated
[01:32:26] child guide less than three
[01:32:29] uh I've been wanting to but I don't know
[01:32:31] if I have time we'll see
[01:32:34] because there's a lot that change like
[01:32:35] the team stuff is all like basically
[01:32:38] actually no there's actually a lot that
[01:32:39] changed
[01:32:41] foreign
[01:32:44] ER shut up don't remind me [ __ ] you
[01:33:00] [ __ ] I thought you died
[01:33:04] can you die
[01:33:22] how many gifted for Virgin shinyan
[01:33:23] dude's already level 90. that actually
[01:33:25] would be dude our bird engineer would be
[01:33:28] insane
[01:33:29] I am not even kidding by the way
[01:33:31] unlucky
[01:33:32] let me uncover resin though I don't know
[01:33:34] why it's kept
[01:33:44] IDE
[01:34:01] that only rolled crit raid still good
[01:34:05] um depends on the character like the
[01:34:07] main reason why it's worse on Lenny than
[01:34:10] other characters is because Lenny has
[01:34:11] crit rate Ascension so he gets 24.2
[01:34:13] percent
[01:34:14] uh for free
[01:34:20] on top of matters already giving a lot
[01:34:23] of crit rate same with the ciao actually
[01:34:27] bro
[01:34:35] okay he's condensed again hello Mr soft
[01:34:37] can you raise my yeah it'll be fine
[01:34:40] though like unless you have a criterate
[01:34:41] circuit or a criterate weapon you should
[01:34:43] you should have enough room to have a
[01:34:45] marketer right
[01:34:46] like it's hard if you have like if you
[01:34:48] have because he basically starts with
[01:34:50] ayaka crude rate so it's like if you
[01:34:52] have a weapon that has grid raid you
[01:34:54] might be like overcapping or near it
[01:34:55] same with like a circlet that's great
[01:34:56] but if you just like damage those things
[01:34:58] you'll be fine this is another 300 bits
[01:35:03] okay why did this person Call Lynette
[01:35:06] tall Xiao
[01:35:08] they're literally nothing alike
[01:35:12] and Lynette's like four foot six
[01:35:21] she's literally [ __ ] four foots later
[01:35:28] summertime goblet Flex uh I don't even
[01:35:31] know if we get spikes like all there
[01:35:32] right now what's on my castle
[01:35:36] that [ __ ] is not a flex
[01:35:39] um
[01:35:43] it's actually looking Grim right now I
[01:35:45] mean my nahida goblet is pretty cracked
[01:35:49] um
[01:35:50] you don't want to know about my hydro
[01:35:52] goblets my Hydraulics are actually
[01:35:54] [ __ ] stupid by the way so we have we
[01:35:56] have this that's whatever we have this
[01:35:57] 23r good for no blast we have 27 on on a
[01:36:00] heart of depth we have 27 on harder
[01:36:02] depth we have 27 on harder depth we also
[01:36:05] have uh two emblem ones for Yvonne and
[01:36:07] xincho we have a uh ocean new clown 27
[01:36:09] that we're not even using a uh almost 40
[01:36:12] crit value
[01:36:13] Vermillion one that we're not using two
[01:36:15] Echoes ones for ayato as well as a 22 ER
[01:36:18] one uh on a set that we probably won't
[01:36:20] use it to be good for like uh let's say
[01:36:21] could call me if you want but I mean
[01:36:23] you're not really gonna hide your damage
[01:36:24] but it is what it is uh but these two
[01:36:26] are really nice for Ito on set and then
[01:36:27] we have this one that we usually don't
[01:36:28] use but right now it's our off piece on
[01:36:30] ayato uh with a very high amount of uh
[01:36:33] over like 42 uh 43 great value
[01:36:37] around 43.
[01:36:38] well 41.8 but uh 2.8 but yeah
[01:36:42] okay there you go
[01:36:48] oh I hit it
[01:36:50] cool
[01:37:03] all right I don't know if that would
[01:37:06] work or not but it worked
[01:37:08] I'm glad that worked I'm glad that
[01:37:09] worked can we get it rewarded oh maybe
[01:37:11] maybe hey crit damage Maybe
[01:37:27] okay
[01:37:29] uh I'm about to teach you guys a lesson
[01:37:31] in knowing what a good artifact is so
[01:37:33] let's say hypothetically
[01:37:36] HP percent is viable on the set let's
[01:37:39] say oh I want HP okay what if this gets
[01:37:42] crit rate then there are not just one
[01:37:45] but two sub stats that are not just
[01:37:47] usable but in my opinion
[01:37:51] pretty good
[01:37:52] so when this rolls 3.9 Critter eight I
[01:37:55] want you to retract your copium and give
[01:37:58] me a formal apology
[01:38:03] um I make it still be good no I can't no
[01:38:06] I can't I mean
[01:38:10] get a nice try though it was a nice try
[01:38:11] like be honest that was a nice try
[01:38:13] that's okay as well I mean eight okay so
[01:38:15] HP like
[01:38:18] let me explain
[01:38:20] ER is good but ER with with no like crit
[01:38:23] rate no attack isn't really good like
[01:38:26] maybe hpeo
[01:38:36] I don't even think it's worth the
[01:38:37] artifact XP and the Mora to test because
[01:38:39] like yeah there's a chance it only rolls
[01:38:41] ER but it's like even then I don't even
[01:38:44] know if I'd use it
[01:38:48] why am I saving mini burst I don't know
[01:38:56] okay we swallow these guys
[01:38:58] show time
[01:39:01] oh my God it's showtime oh my God oh my
[01:39:04] God it's showtime I can't wait I can't

[01:39:49] if we do one roll
[01:39:52] dude what if this gets crittery think
[01:39:54] about it
[01:39:55] are you thinking about it I'm thinking
[01:39:56] about it
[01:40:03] yo yo wait let me cook
[01:40:06] dude imagine if this gets [ __ ]

[01:40:15] lucky
[01:40:31] [ __ ]
[01:40:37] dude if it got current damage dude it
[01:40:39] could have had like I don't know 15 crew
[01:40:41] damage that would have been funny it
[01:40:42] would have been it wouldn't have been
[01:40:43] good but it would have been like all
[01:40:46] right
[01:40:48] no I would it actually would have been
[01:40:49] terrible but it would have been funny

[01:40:57] okay
[01:41:10] how are you not dead
[01:41:14] we got it
[01:41:27] what if I had causal alt behind the tree
[01:41:30] so that the bat the good artifacts that
[01:41:32] are behind are winded forward and then
[01:41:34] they're delivered to me look and then

[01:46:12] to you that even off stream I'm not a
[01:46:13] monster look I better prove it to you
[01:46:15] I'm I'm as genuine as they come come
[01:46:18] where is it uh living beings

[01:46:34] what happened dude maybe like a
[01:46:37] explosion ball dude I'm sorry I actually
[01:46:40] haven't
[01:46:41] wait how maybe it was like near me one
[01:46:44] of them died
[01:46:47] wait I rolled over my [ __ ] headset
[01:46:49] again dude I actually need a different
[01:46:51] headset or chair I don't know what's
[01:46:53] wrong I keep rolling over it but I don't
[01:46:55] know if it's my chair's fault or my
[01:46:56] head's at Salt
[01:47:01] okay we're good
[01:47:03] you monster dude I actually don't know
[01:47:05] how
[01:47:06] it was probably a quest oh for a
[01:47:08] challenge okay there was a challenge for
[01:47:10] a chest I remember what the [ __ ] is this
[01:47:11] oh
[01:47:28] Chad what do you think I've I've chat
[01:47:30] what do you think I've killed more of
[01:47:31] what do you think I've killed more of
[01:47:33] treasure hoarder or ruin greater
[01:47:43] concerned
[01:48:04] there's a new fishing sword good on
[01:48:06] anyone uh it's like okay on Lynette but
[01:48:09] I suspect that because we are in fonten
[01:48:13] a region that is very clearly based
[01:48:15] around a lot of Elemental skill given
[01:48:17] how the set works the new sets it'll
[01:48:21] probably be good on a future character
[01:48:23] I would like to assume
[01:48:27] a lot of the fontention is like oh use
[01:48:29] the skill and then this happens so
[01:48:31] probably
[01:48:32] as of right now it's more of like um
[01:48:36] probably for Future character but I
[01:48:39] don't want to tell you to fish for
[01:48:40] something and then it ends up not being
[01:48:41] good so we'll see
[01:48:44] we'll play Hotel support
[01:48:47] [Music]
[01:49:01] wait so how much curry do we have now
[01:49:04] with hotel we have 99 criterated holy
[01:49:07] [ __ ] thanks to tell
[01:49:21] no I'm dead
[01:49:32] I didn't even Brock valve I didn't even
[01:49:33] attack
[01:49:35] [Music]
[01:49:43] Ed
[01:49:49] that's a lot of Pyro
[01:49:53] nice
[01:49:55] unlucky
[01:50:06] yeah no never mind okay cool
[01:50:16] should I pull for child there's safer
[01:50:17] 4.1 my only five stars are kazua and
[01:50:20] Mona
[01:50:24] um
[01:50:28] [Music]
[01:50:28] um
[01:50:41] both options are good child can give you
[01:50:44] like one of the best if not the best
[01:50:45] team in the game with shangling but you
[01:50:49] could also just play other teams and
[01:50:51] then pull for the new characters because
[01:50:52] they're probably gonna be good so it's
[01:50:53] up to you depends on who you want
[01:50:58] me how long left on the better seven
[01:51:00] days
[01:51:07] but [ __ ] that I mean
[01:51:09] the thing with a child is like he'll be
[01:51:12] the best Hydro option like he'll be the
[01:51:15] best hydration and like the best team
[01:51:17] basically
[01:51:18] but if you're also someone who doesn't
[01:51:20] have a lot of five star well you have
[01:51:22] Mona which means you can Flex Mona in
[01:51:24] like a freeze team or something where
[01:51:26] you wouldn't want to use child so
[01:51:32] skipping the tree animation is bad luck
[01:51:33] okay maybe let's see
[01:51:40] oh
[01:51:45] uh well we did get three artifacts but
[01:51:47] it would seem that this is also bad luck
[01:51:51] well yeah I was gonna say like ayato has
[01:51:54] a lot more teams especially with like
[01:51:55] dendro and stuff
[01:51:57] but child is the best and the best team
[01:51:59] so like it depends what type of player
[01:52:01] you are I think
[01:52:02] like
[01:52:05] yeah I'm a big ayato fan but child has
[01:52:07] higher highs or a higher high
[01:52:10] so it depends on you you know
[01:52:12] if you're like wow I hack and love Chang
[01:52:14] Ling and International's broken then
[01:52:16] [ __ ] play international get child but
[01:52:18] if you're like hey I want to play dendro
[01:52:19] maybe some taser maybe some whatever the
[01:52:21] [ __ ] so you can get Ito well ito's you
[01:52:24] know he's not like there's no ISO Banner
[01:52:25] right now but you know what I mean
[01:52:27] stop it
[01:52:35] wait what if I play Four emblem birth

[01:52:41] second and then I give crit rate to

[01:58:00] time no first
[01:58:03] [Music]
[01:58:27] all right
[01:58:29] [Music]
[01:58:33] we get benadles right we get Ben at all
[01:58:34] let's just get better
[01:58:37] watch us
[01:58:45] [ __ ] we didn't get anything
[01:58:48] it was supposed to be a brew supported
[01:58:50] that way chill chill chill let me cook a
[01:58:51] little let me cook a little let me cook
[01:58:53] a little wait wait wait wait wait
[01:58:56] next time next time next round next
[01:58:57] round next round
[01:59:11] dude I need to know for like that
[01:59:13] average player let's say you're playing
[01:59:14] prototype Crescent on a non-charge
[01:59:16] router like Fishel are you doing a quick
[01:59:19] scope on a weak point or do you not care
[01:59:21] like I need to know what like the
[01:59:22] average player is doing this hey this
[01:59:26] could be good
[01:59:29] each
[01:59:34] show
[01:59:43] because I don't know if I'm coping like
[01:59:47] prototype Crescent is pretty good if you
[01:59:49] uh like can charge our weak point but
[01:59:51] um if you don't have better options but
[01:59:53] low key I kind of like the new craftable
[01:59:55] bow
[01:59:57] uh oh wait there's a why is there a
[01:59:59] spammer shot
[02:00:00] well anyways uh I kind of like the new
[02:00:03] Fontan craftable for official if you
[02:00:05] don't have like um
[02:00:07] if you don't have like stringless or Ali
[02:00:08] Hunter I think it's actually pretty good
[02:00:09] the only weird thing about it is like
[02:00:12] you need to you need to make sure it
[02:00:13] snapshots on to Oz you need to make sure
[02:00:15] you get healed or whatever but correct
[02:00:17] me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure the
[02:00:18] default 10 bow works even on overhealing
[02:00:20] which means even if you're full HP
[02:00:22] uh it'll still buff you I still have to
[02:00:25] test this myself but actually I think I
[02:00:26] did
[02:00:27] um
[02:00:28] and since all the snapshots you can just
[02:00:31] you just have to make sure you someone
[02:00:32] else after but yeah
[02:00:35] all right ready yes watch us we do this
[02:00:37] we swirl them up right then
[02:00:43] dude am I gonna crit or no
[02:00:51] at least we give our Lenny more
[02:00:52] criterate because the hutau thank you
[02:00:55] true

[02:03:31] yeah one out of four we take it one out
[02:03:33] of four we take it one out of four we

[02:07:00] foreign
[02:07:18] [Music]

[02:08:06] morning

[02:08:18] not Showtime sad don't worry we'll make
[02:08:20] it up to you I'll just it'll be Showtime
[02:08:21] I promise if it's not Showtime five
[02:08:23] gifted
[02:08:26] come watch Rogers ready
[02:08:29] there you go just for you it was
[02:08:31] Showtime that's for you
[02:08:33] not for you
[02:08:35] wait where the [ __ ] did it oh he's John
[02:08:37] he's fine
[02:08:47] okay down
[02:08:55] Lindy's Bill's pretty cracked overall
[02:08:57] for like pretty much most characters
[02:08:58] like it's it's better the more like if
[02:09:03] you charge shot and or charge attack and
[02:09:05] it's also better if you run at least one
[02:09:07] other character of the same element like
[02:09:09] two cryo or two Pi or whatever or more
[02:09:12] or like three but even like just in
[02:09:14] general it has the same stats as homo so
[02:09:16] like
[02:09:18] it's at least decent
[02:09:28] foreign
[02:09:36] [Music]
[02:09:48] where child can be used and no other
[02:09:52] Hydro option can there is one team
[02:09:56] that people don't talk about people
[02:09:58] don't test but where child is optimal
[02:10:00] and not an ayato replacement there is
[02:10:03] one danger team
[02:10:04] known as The Forbidden Knowledge where
[02:10:06] even mentioning it
[02:10:08] causes kolei to be sick and nahida to
[02:10:11] disappear
[02:10:14] so please
[02:10:15] be cautious when I tell you this but the
[02:10:19] Forbidden Knowledge team of child double
[02:10:21] dendro and Dory because Dory can uh
[02:10:25] Electrify apply Electro although there's
[02:10:28] ICD but not on hyperloom every 0.4
[02:10:30] seconds in her burst
[02:10:33] double dendro to apply as much dendro as
[02:10:35] possible and Hot Child on field to be as
[02:10:38] much Hydro again as possible rip Tiding
[02:10:41] everything and hydroculating making
[02:10:43] everyone wet
[02:10:45] hyperblooming as much as possible
[02:10:47] because you have the most Electro the
[02:10:48] most dendro and the most Hydro
[02:10:51] with the only
[02:10:53] caveat being no one in the game has ever
[02:10:56] tested this ever because no one wants to
[02:10:58] level 90 Dory because it's Dory and
[02:11:01] that's number one and number two you
[02:11:02] need to be level 90 to play a hyperbloom
[02:11:04] team
[02:11:04] so that's that's what it is it is no
[02:11:07] don't I'm sorry don't say listen I said
[02:11:10] it was Forbidden Knowledge I told you
[02:11:11] not to play it I'm just saying I'm just
[02:11:14] saying
[02:11:19] sorry thing
[02:11:27] because you might be like
[02:11:31] can you just can't you just use cookie
[02:11:33] can you just use kooky can you just use
[02:11:35] kooky can you just use kooky well why do
[02:11:38] you sometimes use Ryden over kooky
[02:11:41] it's um does Electro damage every 1.5
[02:11:44] seconds as you can see in the grass ring
[02:11:46] of sanctification
[02:11:48] writing Shogun is quite a bit faster it
[02:11:51] should be every second not every point
[02:11:52] nine seconds
[02:11:53] okay
[02:11:54] well what if that isn't even fast enough
[02:11:57] what if you want more and you also want
[02:11:59] a Healer well hmm
[02:12:02] hmm
[02:12:04] every 0.4 seconds
[02:12:07] so
[02:12:11] is the team good
[02:12:13] probably not
[02:12:19] but
[02:12:22] that's why it's forbidden knowledge
[02:12:31] you can imagine integrational instead
[02:12:32] which is a good team instead of that
[02:12:33] cringe Forbidden Knowledge no
[02:12:39] that was the best team ever
[02:12:44] smells good but it's also like
[02:12:46] no [ __ ] Nikita shangling Bennett and
[02:12:48] then any [ __ ] character in the game
[02:12:49] is gonna be good well it would be
[02:12:51] burning control Hydro so yeah child is
[02:12:53] pretty fog there
[02:13:17] foreign
[02:13:19] yeah
[02:13:32] I this is why I don't like team names
[02:13:33] because I don't I feel like I've seen
[02:13:36] four different
[02:13:37] child dungeon or pyro teams and I don't
[02:13:40] know which one people are referencing
[02:13:47] I'm not sure which one you're talking
[02:13:49] about
[02:14:01] true
[02:14:12] ever
[02:14:14] like there's like okay there's like some
[02:14:17] team names are like okay that's like a
[02:14:18] TC named it but then there's other team
[02:14:19] names where it's like so clearly as a
[02:14:22] Jeff name
[02:14:25] meanwhile the teams we made we have the
[02:14:27] Forbidden Knowledge cop and we have
[02:14:30] retro version true true the coming to a
[02:14:33] store near you true
[02:14:48] retro version isn't even a real word
[02:14:49] yeah but Deluxe also says retribution
[02:14:51] and it's virgin so yeah
[02:14:54] get [ __ ] oh we've also we've also
[02:14:56] coined Nat Geo for the Ito National Team
[02:14:58] National Geographics true
[02:15:02] although I'm pretty sure that was a
[02:15:03] twitch chatter that I owned it from but
[02:15:04] hey hey I'll take the credit
[02:15:23] s
[02:15:25] Chad do you guys know

[02:30:27] reminiscence is an artifacts that didn't
[02:30:29] get an impact the two piece gives you 80
[02:30:30] attack the Four B's gives you 50 charge
[02:30:32] normal and punch attack damage but it
[02:30:34] costs 15 energy so it's not that good on
[02:30:36] too many characters but characters that
[02:30:37] maybe don't need their burst or can
[02:30:38] spare the energy uh can actually use it
[02:30:40] so yeah it comes with emblem as well
[02:30:42] which makes it a efficient domain to
[02:30:43] farm

[02:35:16] dude blade into Kafka into this guy I
[02:35:19] don't know I don't know man
[02:35:21] I don't know man night Dad
[02:35:24] I don't know man
[02:35:35] I got a better screenshot easy
[02:35:41] foreign
[02:35:42] speaking to Dad voice law what the [ __ ]
[02:35:45] does that mean well I don't have what
[02:35:48] does that mean
[02:35:51] that is not a thing
[02:36:02] I do
[02:36:12] all right
[02:36:15] it's just our walls are in shambles dude
[02:36:18] I feel like that game is literally just
[02:36:22] okay I feel like I have been playing
[02:36:25] Star a lot off stream and I feel like 90
[02:36:27] of the game is literally just like
[02:36:30] look at this super well designed
[02:36:32] character and then you're like okay I
[02:36:33] want him and then next character okay I
[02:36:36] want him okay next character okay I want
[02:36:38] him okay next character okay one it's
[02:36:39] like literally just
[02:36:48] they just kill a pigeon
[02:36:51] foreign
[02:37:03] okay I get that I definitely get that
[02:37:05] because like I would literally if I had
[02:37:08] to I would eat only carrots for a week
[02:37:10] to get Blade with that said I don't
[02:37:12] recommend please don't do that and also
[02:37:14] it's like it's also just a [ __ ] like
[02:37:17] an auto battle like it's not that as
[02:37:20] sweaty in my opinion as gentian I know
[02:37:22] there's like a lot of like
[02:37:25] like
[02:37:27] like
[02:37:28] I don't know like I guess like I know
[02:37:30] Maria chaos is like Abyss like I get it
[02:37:32] but it's like
[02:37:38] yeah I don't know
[02:37:40] it's not
[02:37:51] I don't really know how to explain the
[02:37:53] difference but I feel like it's like
[02:38:01] I feel like especially when you get to
[02:38:02] the point where you can Auto Battle or
[02:38:04] when you're already getting like late
[02:38:05] it's like genjin I feel like it feels a
[02:38:07] bit more satisfying to have really good
[02:38:09] damage it does too in Star rails don't
[02:38:11] get me wrong like it does but it's like
[02:38:13] if your team's clearing your team's
[02:38:15] clearing it's not like
[02:38:17] it doesn't really like
[02:38:20] like I love blade and I love Kafka but
[02:38:22] I'm not like oh blade feels so much more
[02:38:24] fun to play it's like yeah the big
[02:38:26] number is sick or like kafka's dot is
[02:38:28] like feels cool and like I like the team
[02:38:29] [ __ ] like that but it's like I feel like
[02:38:32] I get more satisfaction
[02:38:34] I feel like a character
[02:38:36] can be a lot more fun than another
[02:38:38] character in genjin compared to Star
[02:38:39] rail that's not to say certain
[02:38:41] characters aren't satisfying it's just
[02:38:43] like especially in simulated Universe
[02:38:44] which I know doesn't matter as much but
[02:38:46] like the Hillary it's really universe is
[02:38:47] like [ __ ] sick but like
[02:38:50] yeah
[02:38:52] like
[02:38:55] yeah
[02:38:57] iPhone sponsor no I'm okay look I you
[02:38:59] know I'm addicted to both games and I
[02:39:01] like them both my point is just like I
[02:39:03] love Xiao and I love blade but like if I
[02:39:05] were to play a hundred hours of genshin
[02:39:07] and 100 hours of star rail with both of
[02:39:09] the characters I would see Xiao for a
[02:39:11] hundred of those hours if I'm playing
[02:39:12] them blade I would when I'm like try
[02:39:14] Harding memory of chaos simulator
[02:39:15] Universe whatever but then a lot of
[02:39:17] times it'll just be Auto Battle and it's
[02:39:19] like it's not a bad thing like I like
[02:39:21] that I can Auto Battle and not pay
[02:39:22] attention but it's like I'm not actively
[02:39:26] playing the character for as long
[02:39:28] like percentage-wise of how much I'm
[02:39:30] playing the game
[02:39:43] yeah I do think simulated universe is
[02:39:45] like the best content I know it's not as
[02:39:47] hard like memory chaos a lot harder and
[02:39:49] like you can cheese your way through
[02:39:50] things like I try not to use it for like
[02:39:52] footage or whatever but it's actually so
[02:39:54] [ __ ] fun I I wish we had something
[02:39:55] like that in this game I think it's like
[02:39:57] literally the best part of the game
[02:40:00] yeah and like as as someone attracted
[02:40:02] like I'm sure we're gonna get new worlds
[02:40:03] new difficulties like it might actually
[02:40:05] start like be harder and harder but like
[02:40:08] even if it's not that like
[02:40:10] obviously I do want it to be a challenge
[02:40:11] and sometimes it is
[02:40:13] but I think it's just really fun
[02:40:21] well lydian is so slow I feel stuck
[02:40:24] playing him not flowy enough
[02:40:26] oh this sounds like you are playing uh
[02:40:28] Lenny like you're playing gonyu which is
[02:40:30] not how you're supposed to play Lenny
[02:40:31] let me show you
[02:40:33] [Laughter]
[02:40:36] saves the day I got you
[02:40:38] [Music]
[02:40:40] what
[02:40:47] wait
[02:40:50] I have an idea uh give me a second shot
[02:40:53] let me look something up
[02:40:54] let me see if I can do this
[02:41:01] [ __ ] character limit exceeded
[02:41:29] what
[02:41:38] I'll try to write for a bit but with
[02:41:40] [ __ ] text
[02:41:44] for Biden oh my God I just ruined this
[02:41:47] team for me
[02:41:51] okay this looks disgusting
[02:41:55] but you guys can't even see it
[02:41:57] looks disgusting
[02:42:03] whatever we'll leave it for now I'll
[02:42:04] probably forget about it
[02:42:09] okay I'll play a real team to show you
[02:42:10] what I was talking about with Lenny
[02:42:13] I play some music
[02:42:18] uh
[02:42:19] uh you clear memory of shenzhou 6 and
[02:42:21] HSR oh that's the other one right I
[02:42:23] fully cleared my chaos last stream and I
[02:42:25] didn't do the other one
[02:42:26] but I thought it was easier than
[02:42:27] America's if it's hard I'll do I mean
[02:42:29] I'll do it either way but
[02:42:31] I thought it was easy
[02:42:33] is it hard
[02:42:36] harder okay we can do it next
[02:42:40] impossible oh really why haven't I done
[02:42:42] it then
[02:42:46] one five is easy oh okay okay I will try
[02:42:48] then I'll do one to five Austrian pearly
[02:42:51] oh yeah so okay you can like charge on
[02:42:53] already but typically you can also play
[02:42:54] them kind of quick swappy like you can
[02:42:56] swap it to him you know you do a charge
[02:42:57] line
[02:42:58] you can do another
[02:43:00] okay
[02:43:01] my strongly does not have HP now this
[02:43:03] looks bad and now you're gonna be like
[02:43:04] oh I was right okay my point was just
[02:43:05] gonna be you could like you know you can
[02:43:07] do some charge songs right but like
[02:43:09] you're shielded you're not gonna get
[02:43:10] interrupted if your Shield doesn't suck
[02:43:11] like mine does I meant to put Power on
[02:43:12] them I don't know why I did that and
[02:43:14] then you know you can you can Bing chill
[02:43:15] you can count a quick swap you can do
[02:43:17] like example Lenny burst
[02:43:19] and I'm only gonna do one chart look
[02:43:21] I'll just do one
[02:43:22] and then you'd use like either dad boom
[02:43:24] you swap boom you swap boom you swap
[02:43:26] like you want to do more than one
[02:43:27] charger usually do like three two to
[02:43:29] four
[02:43:30] but like even if you want to play them
[02:43:31] quick swappy you can like if that's more
[02:43:33] like that's more enjoyable for me
[02:43:36] you can also play shangling
[02:43:47] okay let's level artifacts let's see if
[02:43:48] we got something good for actually
[02:43:50] we'll use that fragile
[02:43:53] no no no

[02:44:13] gonna do it but you guys already typed
[02:44:14] the five letters it's too late boom
[02:44:18] that was not worth it
[02:44:24] okay let's level artifacts we have a
[02:44:26] Redemption Arc for the last stream
[02:44:28] it is time

[02:45:45] archon again
[02:45:50] should I throw a plus 20 it's probably a

[02:58:17] could be good
[02:58:38] that definitely could not be good I
[02:58:40] don't know why I said that
[02:58:46] it literally only had crit damage dude
[02:58:48] why did I even say this could be good
[02:58:51] this is literally better
[02:58:53] [ __ ] it
[02:59:19] chat ah it's [ __ ] Grim I actually
[02:59:22] need to [ __ ] okay I don't even know
[02:59:23] what to do
[02:59:25] thank you
[02:59:30] maybe we continue this another yet
[02:59:32] another day
[02:59:34] all of them aren't even bad but it's
[02:59:35] like
[02:59:36] we got them in like the middle so it's
[02:59:38] like kind of awkward
[02:59:50] dude okay ah the ending it was kind of
[02:59:53] sad but
[02:59:54] some of the pieces were sad but we
[02:59:56] literally got
[03:00:00] giving us a prime
[03:00:01] rigid dude okay so some of the pieces
[03:00:04] were sad we literally got this we got
[03:00:05] this we got this we got a good so like
[03:00:09] okay matters just do we have a good
[03:00:10] flower we have a good feather a few good
[03:00:12] feathers we have a good flower kind of
[03:00:15] we have a good HP Sans
[03:00:18] and we have uh the usable circuit kind
[03:00:21] of not really
[03:00:22] and then golden we have a okay circlet
[03:00:25] pretty good just enroll crit a goblin
[03:00:28] with em a feather with em a feather with
[03:00:31] em and a feather with crit it's like
[03:00:33] it's good but it's not like
[03:00:35] yeah it would be good if
[03:00:38] I don't know let's say a future Hydro
[03:00:40] character caulk man says Hey I want a
[03:00:44] hydro stuff and then we can use like
[03:00:45] this on him or something I don't know
[03:00:46] but like we don't know we literally
[03:00:48] don't know I'm just saying there's a
[03:00:49] chance that future characters want
[03:00:51] [ __ ] HP because it's [ __ ] Fontaine
[03:00:54] that's all I'm saying so there's a
[03:00:55] chance that we actually have a good
[03:00:55] match we'll see uh am I gonna end it
[03:00:58] here or am I gonna go again I don't know
[03:01:00] we'll see but we spent like literally
[03:01:02] probably 8 000 resin at this point so
[03:01:04] yeah
[03:01:08] we'll see I'll figure it out
[03:01:10] dude okay
[03:01:12] okay and though to get official footage
[03:01:14] so I'm probably gonna Farm a bit off
[03:01:15] stream and also gonna Farm
[03:01:17] next stream uh next thing I'm gonna do
[03:01:20] next year will be star rail Dan hung ill
[03:01:22] and bibitter imbibator lunae
[03:01:25] and then the third the stream after that
[03:01:28] will be gentian again where I'm either
[03:01:30] gonna do the arc I might do some resin I
[03:01:32] might do Arkham Quest I don't know I
[03:01:33] want to do the archon quest but I also
[03:01:35] need this [ __ ] set
[03:01:37] and it's a new Abyss soon I actually
[03:01:39] don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing I
[03:01:40] need to stream so much dude because I I
[03:01:42] don't I'll figure it out but there's
[03:01:44] gonna be missing tomorrow and then after
[03:01:45] we might do like archon and then Abyss
[03:01:48] by the way we'll see but I really want
[03:01:50] to do I really need to get a good set so
[03:01:52] I could I mean I could also just make
[03:01:54] the official video and then be like I
[03:01:56] don't have the good set yet because it
[03:01:57] doesn't really matter
[03:01:59] because it's not like officials like
[03:02:01] it's just like a bill it doesn't [ __ ]
[03:02:03] matter it's still official anyways all
[03:02:05] right thanks for watching love you guys
[03:02:06] I could just use the two beats for now
[03:02:08] actually
[03:02:10] that would make sense just use the two
[03:02:12] piece now and then when I get a good
[03:02:13] four piece use a four piece
[03:02:15] all right I'm gonna end because I wasn't
[03:02:16] planning on streaming today it's the
[03:02:17] shortest stream a lot of people though
[03:02:18] there's just some things I want to talk
[03:02:19] about instead of stream so I hope that's
[03:02:20] all cool I'm gonna be working on my dad
[03:02:22] hung ambiter Lune guide now if I want to
[03:02:25] make it I haven't decided but I've
[03:02:26] already recorded half this I probably
[03:02:27] will
[03:02:28] hopefully it is good I believe I
[03:02:30] understand how to build and play him so
[03:02:32] I hope I can convey that in a guide hope
[03:02:35] you guys enjoy it after that I will see
