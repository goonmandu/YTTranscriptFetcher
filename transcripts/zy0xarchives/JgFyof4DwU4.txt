[00:29:53] him but [ __ ] you anyways uh uh so we
[00:29:56] will make a new signo guys C1 oh it's
[00:29:58] attack speed yes I
[00:30:00] remember
[00:30:01] [Music]
[00:30:08] uh yeah it's attack speed I mean
[00:30:11] [Music]
[00:30:16] cool
[00:30:19] wow that's POG it probably it changes
[00:30:22] your combos a
[00:30:23] little more normals before like an e but
[00:30:27] it's I
[00:30:29] yeah the thing the thing about sinos
[00:30:31] optimal combos that I hate is that like
[00:30:34] okay let's say you're playing Sino like
[00:30:35] TF right you can usually do like two e
[00:30:38] like let's say you can okay let's okay
[00:30:39] let's say okay let's say okay let's say
[00:30:41] okay let's say you can do exactly five
[00:30:43] normals before an e right when the I
[00:30:45] appears if you do one too many and you
[00:30:47] miss the I like let's say you do an E
[00:30:49] and you're like okay I'll get my e back
[00:30:51] my second e with thundering Fury before
[00:30:53] the the I appears and then you something
[00:30:56] happens right you miss a reaction an
[00:30:58] enemy knocks you you miss a normal
[00:30:59] attack some some some some error occurs
[00:31:02] then everything is ruined you miss your
[00:31:04] eye and then you want to jump off a
[00:31:05] cliff both in game and out of game
[00:31:08] please don't do that but that's how Soo
[00:31:09] feels if you miss the eye which is why
[00:31:12] even though some rotations are optimal I
[00:31:14] just I try to like not risk it actually
[00:31:16] that's not true I I usually risk it and
[00:31:17] then regret it but okay no one asked no
[00:31:20] one asked I was watching CS in the

[00:58:49] together I'm going to make sure the
[00:58:50] dialogue's loud enough it's going to be
[00:58:52] on English so that I don't have to like
[00:58:53] read so I can actually listen while
[00:58:54] reading chat and if Pon speaks and it's
[00:58:58] not relevant she will be skipped
[00:59:00] everyone else I'm listening to that's it
[00:59:03] I'm not going to skip dialogue but if
[00:59:05] it's a random like if it's like Pon
[00:59:06] maybe and if it's a random NPC and it's
[00:59:08] just wasting time maybe but I'll try not
[00:59:10] to the chaos and stalling thank you so

[00:59:24] archon Quest catalyic quickening Chad do
[00:59:28] you know that Quicken is the reaction uh
[00:59:30] of dendro and Electro together you can
[00:59:33] leave a Quicken Aura on enemies when
[00:59:35] allowing both dendro and and and wait no
[00:59:39] that's yeah and Electro to Coexist on an
[00:59:42] enemy and then from there there are two
[00:59:43] sub reactions aggravate and Spread
[00:59:46] spread you spread the enemy's cheeks and
[00:59:48] then you uh your dendro damage is
[00:59:50] increased when you apply dendro onto a
[00:59:53] uh quickened enemy and then aggravate is
[00:59:55] the same thing but with h Electro
[00:59:57] instead of
[01:00:02] dendro so this is the team we're going

[01:02:53] but that's the only thing I got spoiled
[01:02:54] nothing else I know like always second
[01:02:57] can to do some things like I know nevet
[01:02:59] is like a dragon or there might be more
[01:03:00] lore I don't know I know Fina has like
[01:03:03] other I don't know I know finina has
[01:03:05] like a lot of lore I just don't know
[01:03:06] what it is so I'm just not getting
[01:03:07] spoiled that's it that's all I know
[01:03:09] that's you guys are in the same boat as
[01:03:10] me that's all I know maybe you guys know
[01:03:12] maybe but that's all I know that's all I
[01:03:14] know anyways we're going to go through
[01:03:17] the rest okay
[01:03:20] okay I also know that it's sad but
[01:03:23] anyways also listen dude I saw listen I
[01:03:27] saw this has nothing to do with the
[01:03:29] archon quest but people were talking
[01:03:31] listen I don't know who posted this or
[01:03:34] why or what the context was but I saw
[01:03:37] people ranking R in over finina listen
[01:03:41] here
[01:03:43] [ __ ] I love Ryden too she's
[01:03:46] cool she can be played as hyper blo
[01:03:47] she's versatile she can be played a few
[01:03:50] teams how is she above
[01:03:53] finina
[01:03:54] [Music]
[01:03:56] how is she above finina Dumbo sorry that
[01:03:59] was toxic she's not but Ren's good she's
[01:04:02] a valuable character to your account but
[01:04:05] uh personally I think it's nahita finina
[01:04:08] Ryden Shong Lee venti in that order uh
[01:04:11] but you could honestly argue Jang Lee
[01:04:13] could be more valuable if you value the
[01:04:14] shield and he's met on some teams like
[01:04:16] nlet uh like Linny and a few
[01:04:21] others
[01:04:23] anyways
[01:04:29] you're not sorry dude I have to clear
[01:04:32] any misinformation okay I don't want my

[01:07:15] inmate to becoming the manager of the
[01:07:17] whole place I'm not going to lie I kind

[01:10:01] that our information is always so

[01:10:43] massage his ego the welfare meals oh my
[01:10:46] arare
[01:10:47] meals we ate the most incredible welfare
[01:10:50] meal right right that meal we had
[01:10:52] yesterday was super delicious is that so
[01:10:57] to tell you the truth I've been helping
[01:10:59] out with making those welfare meals I've
[01:11:01] been working as a kitchen assistant for
[01:11:03] about a month and a half now oh so
[01:11:06] you're the one who made thanks so
[01:11:09] mistakes you are correct I am a true
[01:11:12] professional in fact I even went to
[01:11:14] culinary school W you like my cooking I
[01:11:18] guess that means we share similar tastes
[01:11:20] listen carefully this little bombshell
[01:11:24] will help you learn what's really going
[01:11:26] on here in the
[01:11:28] Fortress huh did lav Ron just wink at me
[01:11:31] it seems he's saying don't be upset he's
[01:11:34] a good fellow listen kids the power
[01:11:37] structure within the Fortress is quite
[01:11:39] complicated the overworlds couldn't care
[01:11:42] less about us down here we're basically
[01:11:45] dogs to them you've already met the one
[01:11:48] person here you should never cross the
[01:11:49] Duke Risley he knows more than you think
[01:11:53] and if he he doesn't care about
[01:11:54] something then he often doesn't bother
[01:11:57] dealing with
[01:11:59] it those who have the Duke's attention
[01:12:02] get all kinds of special perks even
[01:12:05] better treatment in the
[01:12:07] infirmary wait Chad who's the chii of
[01:12:09] this place called what's her name
[01:12:10] character right I don't think there's
[01:12:12] anything useful about him at all why
[01:12:15] does he visit the infirmary practically
[01:12:17] day is it normal for anyone to be going
[01:12:19] in and out of there so often if you ask
[01:12:21] me he's just faking at to get out of
[01:12:24] work but did you know that chria was a
[01:12:28] talented researcher from the Fontaine
[01:12:30] Research Institute before he came here
[01:12:33] there's no denying that I don't care if
[01:12:36] he was a researcher that could turn dirt
[01:12:38] into MOA once you're in the Fortress of
[01:12:40] meped you're just another inmate like
[01:12:42] everybody
[01:12:44] else ah interesting according to qu
[01:12:47] thought a person named Jer frequents the
[01:12:50] infirmary I should take note of that
[01:12:52] speaking which the last time I saw him
[01:12:55] he was passing by in the corridor with
[01:12:57] LaVine I also heard they started arguing
[01:12:59] in the library and got into a fight
[01:13:02] right guess that's just how terrible of
[01:13:04] a guy he is you mean he hit a woman wow
[01:13:08] I never imaged he was that bad but that
[01:13:11] Line's also quite the odd one you know
[01:13:14] she's always gabbing away got into a
[01:13:16] fight with a man and she also got sent
[01:13:18] to the
[01:13:19] infirmary come to think of it I always
[01:13:23] see her going to the Sick Bay every
[01:13:24] couple of days
[01:13:26] too huh wait a second you don't think do
[01:13:31] you think could it be that they're
[01:13:33] secretly meeting there to go on
[01:13:35] dates ah but it's really hard to
[01:13:39] imagine dude I'm sure this matters but
[01:13:42] like I do remember seeing Jor to a that
[01:13:45] one
[01:13:46] time and we might be overthinking
[01:13:50] things so J had a confrontation with a
[01:13:52] girl named l
[01:13:54] who also frequently visits the infirmary
[01:13:57] I'll remember that
[01:13:58] too okay we've talked to just about

[01:17:23] Master of the Knights of
[01:17:24] favonius nice to meet
[01:17:27] you that look in your eyes you found
[01:17:31] something a little something yeah hey
[01:17:33] this is no time to be modest
[01:17:36] just as expected of the legendary Duo
[01:17:39] you have my full and undivided
[01:17:42] attention Okay so what did we find I
[01:17:45] actually don't remember act three it's
[01:17:47] been like a I mean I remember I
[01:17:49] remember the rumors swirling about this
[01:17:52] place are unreliable after all and oh
[01:17:54] yeah how Child Left remember how child
[01:17:56] dipped yeah yeah we remember we remember
[01:17:58] he is a Harbinger after all I suppose
[01:18:01] he's much more resourceful than I
[01:18:03] initially gave him credit for
[01:18:05] unfortunately this isn't enough for our
[01:18:07] final report to Father we need to find
[01:18:10] out Master child's exact whereabouts no
[01:18:13] this isn't act three anymore father told
[01:18:14] me even though Master child said he was
[01:18:16] just coming I hope we get to meet father
[01:18:18] again he actually had some personal
[01:18:21] reasons his agenda might be linked to
[01:18:23] his disappearance the most important
[01:18:26] thing right now is to catch up to himout
[01:18:27] is already flooded so we'll have to test
[01:18:30] someone with professional diving skills
[01:18:32] to chase after him well when you put it
[01:18:35] that way it's obvious that only fremin
[01:18:37] would be up to the
[01:18:39] task Bingo he's working today why L's
[01:18:42] eyes AB attracted too much attention
[01:18:45] I'll talk to him about it later please
[01:18:47] do it's the least I can do we're all in
[01:18:50] this together so it's only fair for us
[01:18:52] to fulfill our end of the bargain
[01:18:54] honestly I'm far more impressed by you
[01:18:57] guys managing to collect all this
[01:18:58] information right under risley's
[01:19:00] watchful
[01:19:02] ice collecting information has always
[01:19:04] been our strong point
[01:19:07] true now let me think to find out more
[01:19:10] information fremin will have to retrace
[01:19:13] Master child's original route and if
[01:19:16] he's to do that he'll have to set out on
[01:19:18] the next pipe cleaning day at the
[01:19:19] earliest that's 6 days from now H okay
[01:19:24] we can go clean some pipes after that
[01:19:26] he'll probably take another two or three
[01:19:28] days to return you can even estimate how
[01:19:31] long it'll take for him to get back
[01:19:33] we've been working together for a long
[01:19:35] time we know each other's capabilities
[01:19:38] like the backs of our hands you don't
[01:19:40] look like Jean bro that's cuz my camera
[01:19:42] it cuts it cuts too early it cuts you
[01:19:45] want me to
[01:19:47] do [ __ ] my my thing just
[01:19:51] fell
[01:19:55] oh and there's just one last thing we'd
[01:19:57] like your help with though we can just
[01:19:59] sit back and wait for fremin's report on
[01:20:01] Master child's whereabouts we still need
[01:20:04] to make more progress on the
[01:20:05] investigation of the forbidden zone
[01:20:07] fremin is no master of disguise
[01:20:10] lynnette's still working on getting
[01:20:11] Intel from the other areas and I'll need
[01:20:13] to spend some time helping fem prepare
[01:20:15] for his diving Mission so you are the
[01:20:19] only ones we can count
[01:20:21] on what do you want us to you will it be
[01:20:23] hard hey it'll well I won't call it easy
[01:20:27] per se but I think you'll be able to
[01:20:29] pull it up wait that's how you spell it
[01:20:30] per se listen carefully you'll need to
[01:20:32] find an excuse to get into the infirmary
[01:20:34] and investigate the room and environs
[01:20:37] you mentioned several sketchy looking
[01:20:39] people always meeting at the infirmary
[01:20:41] earlier so it probably has something to
[01:20:43] do with the secret we're hoping to
[01:20:45] uncover you've already met the head
[01:20:47] nurse so she'll be less suspicious of
[01:20:49] you investigate the internal structure
[01:20:51] of the infirmary and any active dealings
[01:20:53] within and pass those on to me alongside
[01:20:56] anything else you're able to discover
[01:20:58] but also there's no need to take risks
[01:21:01] don't forget safety always comes sounds
[01:21:03] good my apologies I just started
[01:21:06] rambling out of
[01:21:08] habit it was almost as if I was talking
[01:21:11] to my younger sister but that's not a
[01:21:13] bad thing right but what if I'm the

[01:24:13] Auto God does it hurt when I press
[01:24:19] here and here huh oh that hurt based on
[01:24:23] my initial checkup there shouldn't be a
[01:24:25] problem here how
[01:24:29] strange oh no was my acting a bit over
[01:24:32] the
[01:24:33] top what about here does this no not
[01:24:37] really
[01:24:39] oh I understand so that's what it is I
[01:24:43] think you just ate something that
[01:24:44] disagreed with you that's all nothing
[01:24:47] too serious outside of a pretty bad
[01:24:49] stomach ache when it decides to act up
[01:24:52] true H so that's what it is
[01:24:55] MHM and there have been other inmates
[01:24:57] complaining about the food recently I'll
[01:25:00] inform our head chef Mr we just threw
[01:25:02] our [ __ ] Chef friend under the bus
[01:25:04] what the hell congratulations the health
[01:25:06] risk is incredibly low so you should
[01:25:08] recover within a couple days why don't
[01:25:11] you here while I go get some medicine
[01:25:13] for you miss larine I'll have to trouble
[01:25:16] you to help me look after this new
[01:25:18] patient while I'm gone very
[01:25:21] well
[01:25:23] I know this is and she hopped away just
[01:25:25] like
[01:25:26] that pH this infiltration mission is
[01:25:29] going much smoother than I imag next
[01:25:30] there only two people left in the room C
[01:25:32] called that woman Lin so she had to be
[01:25:34] one of those frequent visitors that INF
[01:25:35] me I've heard before would that mean
[01:25:36] that man next to her is hello how do
[01:25:39] you still not great I can't keep staring
[01:25:42] at her it'll draw unwanted attention
[01:25:44] this guy also seems to have noticed her
[01:25:46] stomach aches really bad she was
[01:25:48] stumbling about the whole way here so
[01:25:50] I'm going to say something this feels
[01:25:51] like the [ __ ] biggest waste of time I
[01:25:53] want to mash my space bar but obviously
[01:25:55] it's going to matter they wouldn't make
[01:25:56] us go through all this dialogue if these
[01:25:58] two weren't important so I'm sure
[01:25:59] they're going to matter for something
[01:26:00] but bro I don't care about these two
[01:26:02] [ __ ] random lovers I do not care they
[01:26:04] could literally both die and I wouldn't
[01:26:07] my day would progress the same way and
[01:26:09] there's no need to worry she's the best
[01:26:11] medic we've got down
[01:26:14] here but it also looks like she's the
[01:26:17] only medic you've got down here H well
[01:26:21] that's true
[01:26:22] yeah well true what do you mean that's
[01:26:26] true that's really misrepresenting the
[01:26:29] situation of course I can't speak for
[01:26:31] the whole Fortress but it's not like
[01:26:33] everyone in prisoned here is useless you
[01:26:35] know though they may have committed
[01:26:37] crimes and gotten locked up here as a
[01:26:38] result they still know a thing or two
[01:26:40] about medicine and they help missen take
[01:26:43] care of the sick and injur who asked

[01:28:58] the wall a wait there seems to be a
[01:29:00] movable hatch he there's no need to
[01:29:04] fight release it's way too early for us
[01:29:07] to even think about that and who the
[01:29:10] heck knows if we'd even be able to
[01:29:11] continue our previous
[01:29:14] lives the presence of a movable hatch
[01:29:16] isn't strange by itself but perhaps it's
[01:29:19] my adventurer's intuition speaking but
[01:29:21] isn't isn't this a bit strange that
[01:29:23] there's a movable hatch over here is it
[01:29:24] is it is it hiding something please
[01:29:26] allow me to end this boring and useless
[01:29:29] conversation oh and Mr Jer I don't want

[01:30:04] him can't stand him

[01:30:10] like someone who's as arrogant and
[01:30:12] obsessed with weird research topics as
[01:30:14] he
[01:30:18] is but there's no need to keep dwelling
[01:30:21] on him

[01:35:39] expression as she Pockets the info truly
[01:35:41] a professional Lynette truly a
[01:35:43] professional truly a professional we

[01:36:16] could I swear by my
[01:36:20] sword
[01:36:22] I had a thigh strap but it it it broke
[01:36:24] cuz my thighs are too
[01:36:26] thick it broke did you shave no I didn't
[01:36:29] shave why am i showing you guys my legs
[01:36:32] this is weird all right back to this yo
[01:36:35] yo my bad my bad
[01:36:38] chat yo don't clip
[01:36:47] that you twitch your true we're fine
[01:36:51] this is what they
[01:37:03] wanted did you two run into any trouble
[01:37:06] over the past few days uh I was in the
[01:37:08] Vermilion domain according to the
[01:37:10] schedule nothing weird happened there's
[01:37:12] like a run grader but he's not that bad
[01:37:14] honestly it was pretty fine that's good
[01:37:16] that means you didn't raise any
[01:37:17] suspicions when you infiltrated the
[01:37:19] infirmary okay we've taken a look at the
[01:37:21] slip you've sent fremin successfully
[01:37:24] left the grounds via the pipes 2 days
[01:37:25] ago and as of last night Lynette has
[01:37:28] also infiltrated the infirmary after
[01:37:30] faking an
[01:37:32] illness wait why is she getting involved
[01:37:34] as
[01:37:35] well you already went above and beyond
[01:37:38] when you scoped out the infirmary to put
[01:37:40] it more bluntly even if we were to view
[01:37:43] that as something you did in exchange
[01:37:44] for F's help you've already done more
[01:37:47] than enough thanks Lenny infiltrating a
[01:37:49] guarded stronghold is a different kind
[01:37:51] of job from a one-off investigation we
[01:37:54] want to avoid using the same faces over
[01:37:56] and over and reduce the amount of
[01:37:57] suspicion that will fall on any given
[01:37:59] person Lynette also felt like you have
[01:38:02] already taken the first step for us so
[01:38:04] she should be the one to finish the job
[01:38:06] thanks Lynette so that's what Lynette
[01:38:08] thinks Pon hopes everything's going well
[01:38:11] for
[01:38:12] her yeah I'm not opposed to helping you
[01:38:15] perhaps that's true you are both very
[01:38:18] good people and we've come to appreciate
[01:38:21] that more than anyone else unfortunately

[01:38:26] between us lest you've forgotten the
[01:38:28] matter of our respective loyalties

[01:41:04] half an hour Lynette knows this as well
[01:41:06] so this should be a good time up with
[01:41:09] her okay oh yeah we heard about that
[01:41:11] also I'm her brother remember it's only
[01:41:14] natural for an older brother to care
[01:41:16] about his younger sister's
[01:41:18] wellbeing okay then let's head over
[01:41:20] right away
[01:41:23] cool let's go
[01:41:33] over oh B's
[01:41:37] protector nice Lynette should be here
[01:41:41] right now
[01:41:43] huh
[01:41:45] strange Lynette I sued seen isn't here
[01:41:49] but why is Lynette here could she have
[01:41:53] found a lead and left the follow it no
[01:41:56] Lynette rarely deviates from the plan we
[01:41:58] agree that if she were to make changes
[01:42:00] on the Fly she' find a way to let me
[01:42:02] know oh [ __ ] unless oh no let's see if
[01:42:06] there are any clues around here we can
[01:42:08] look while we wait for her
[01:42:13] okay oh
[01:42:17] [ __ ] why is this music kind of
[01:42:19] epic
[01:42:21] wait this music's actually
[01:42:24] yo there are some books here and a few
[01:42:27] files they all look like medical record
[01:42:30] H advanced nursing how to raise the
[01:42:33] spirit of your patients a quick guide to
[01:42:36] the P these sure are some interesting
[01:42:38] books who knew seuen would be interested
[01:42:41] in these kinds of things she even has
[01:42:43] books on understanding people's
[01:42:45] motivations and
[01:42:46] feelings H is it because she's a meloine
[01:42:50] or did she have a need to understand her
[01:42:52] patient's emotional state she
[01:42:54] manipulates seems quite normal to me
[01:42:56] maybe not I don't know these are skills
[01:42:58] that would come in handy for a nurse
[01:42:59] from time to time
[01:43:12] true none of the beds have any signs of
[01:43:14] having been slept in except that one
[01:43:17] over there that's the one lyette must
[01:43:20] have used right you said she was
[01:43:22] pretending to be
[01:43:23] sick mhm she would have said her
[01:43:26] migraine was having a particularly bad
[01:43:28] flare up generally speaking the head
[01:43:31] nurse would then ask her to lie down and
[01:43:33] rest while she left to retrieve the but
[01:43:35] this bed is unmade means either the
[01:43:38] headse didn't return the entire time
[01:43:40] from when Lynette laid down up until she
[01:43:42] left the bed or the nurse intentionally
[01:43:45] left it this
[01:43:47] way why would they leave it that way
[01:43:51] that's
[01:43:53] suspicious let me let me check this
[01:43:55] hatch over here that lumine talked about
[01:43:56] eight [ __ ] times if there's she
[01:43:58] mentioned it so many times this has to
[01:43:59] be pivotal to the story if it's not I'm
[01:44:01] quitting get
[01:44:03] impa ah this is it we saw it before wait
[01:44:07] this thing if it is I'm becoming a lord
[01:44:09] Skipper doesn't look like it's been
[01:44:10] disguised that
[01:44:14] well wait gon just tweeted wait wait
[01:44:16] wait is there something new wait wait
[01:44:18] wait one sec from it side I don't think
[01:44:21] it's an entrance that is meant to be
[01:44:22] taken apart there's probably a mechanism
[01:44:26] around here somewhere genius invocation
[01:44:29] TCG of
[01:44:31] [Music]
[01:44:44] course is there anything
[01:44:49] else
[01:44:51] TCG uh yeah there's a star live stream

[01:45:54] behind it is empty from its size I don't
[01:45:56] think the entrance that is meant to be
[01:45:57] taken apart there's probably me
[01:45:58] mechanism around here somewhere could
[01:46:00] Lynette have tried to get
[01:46:01] inside but if that's the case she would
[01:46:04] have contacted me for
[01:46:09] sure let's look around here for some

[01:47:12] subconsciously okay true why you
[01:47:15] roasting
[01:47:16] Lenny he's worried about his sister
[01:47:19] man hey you guys to over here a slip of
[01:47:25] paper it's right over here and there's a
[01:47:27] bunch written on it too it
[01:47:32] reads out of respect for your usual
[01:47:35] practices I'll use a piece of paper or
[01:47:38] card as the medium to pass on my message
[01:47:41] you may consider this as me giving you
[01:47:44] my best regards this is is is that all
[01:47:48] is there anything on the back the back
[01:47:52] show me now
[01:47:54] uhoh
[01:47:58] uh-oh
[01:47:59] uh-oh that look on your face P's reading
[01:48:03] it now would you care to guess where
[01:48:05] Miss lenette of the foule could be right
[01:48:08] now no could she have is she already
[01:48:13] wait
[01:48:14] what did he deliberately leave the
[01:48:17] infirmary unguarded to use it as bait
[01:48:21] wait you mean he was aware of our goals
[01:48:24] from the very beginning but why we
[01:48:27] didn't run into any trouble last time
[01:48:29] and he also never reached out to us
[01:48:31] since why would he choose the ACT drink
[01:48:33] or second infiltration and time to set
[01:48:35] the first yes that is a crucial question
[01:48:40] Risley he doesn't do anything without a
[01:48:42] clear goal or Reason so this means he
[01:48:45] had no activities from the very
[01:48:47] beginning you not from the same camp us
[01:48:51] you were sent down here by nervet so you
[01:48:53] have no interest with Ry we're a
[01:48:56] completely different story though why
[01:48:58] only I go after Lynette why didn't he go
[01:48:59] after you as
[01:49:00] well I'd like to know that too why did
[01:49:04] he only go after
[01:49:06] her don't panic just think everything
[01:49:09] over I have to stay calm this is not
[01:49:12] like what happened last time the
[01:49:14] Situation's different
[01:49:16] now uh-oh lind's panicking wait you're
[01:49:19] right
[01:49:21] wait but that means the fact that fremin
[01:49:24] was able to leave the grounds could
[01:49:26] Risley have let him go as well but what
[01:49:29] does he gain by letting F leave like
[01:49:32] that I get it now you're
[01:49:35] or he deliberately made them both
[01:49:38] disappear so he's challenging me and
[01:49:41] trying to provoke me I'm sure of
[01:49:43] it minus two siblings we never should
[01:49:46] have sent out fem we had to go through
[01:49:49] all that trouble to find an opening to
[01:49:50] sneak him around the guards and into the
[01:49:52] pipe and we even thought luck was on our
[01:49:54] side if Risley let him leave on purpose
[01:49:58] then he's probably in a terrible spot
[01:50:00] now as well Lenny's getting more and
[01:50:02] more panicked we have to calm him down
[01:50:05] Lenny calm down yes that'll I'm sure
[01:50:07] that'll work don't be like this Linny PR
[01:50:10] wouldn't have left if we hadn't told you
[01:50:12] about child that was our fault no I'm
[01:50:16] the leader of this operation and I'm the
[01:50:18] one responsible for this team I was the
[01:50:20] one who failed to protect
[01:50:22] them I'll go talk to Risley hey don't be
[01:50:26] Reckless traveler please I simply cannot
[01:50:29] allow Lynette to be abducted again I
[01:50:32] have to go I'll find a way to get them
[01:50:34] back
[01:50:38] oh he's rushed out the door after
[01:50:43] him why is she
[01:50:48] there what the the [ __ ] I feel like we
[01:50:52] still have some room to make changes on
[01:50:53] these
[01:50:55] details it's okay she's going to help us
[01:50:57] but it will require extensive testing is
[01:51:00] that
[01:51:01] so very well then please be mindful of
[01:51:05] the
[01:51:07] time
[01:51:09] huh is someone pack everything up uh-oh
[01:51:14] pack what up outside is e dropping
[01:51:17] they'll probably come in once we stop
[01:51:19] talking
[01:51:21] damn she [ __ ] called it someone
[01:51:24] please help she she's
[01:51:28] sick wait a second I don't really like
[01:51:30] her right

[01:51:40] this place oh they are quite sharp what
[01:51:44] a delightful turn of
[01:51:46] events I like smart people but I also
[01:51:49] like like playing
[01:51:51] dumb I like the feeling of being
[01:51:55] trusted oh my what's wrong little one
[01:51:59] there's no need to panic take a deep
[01:52:01] breath before you
[01:52:04] begin being able to read human
[01:52:06] Expressions is quite the useful skill
[01:52:09] okay she better have a Redemption Arc in
[01:52:11] this Quest cuz right now I want to roll
[01:52:12] her off a cliff but maybe her intentions

[01:52:38] timeout not even cuz it was a banable
[01:52:40] offense just cuz you made me cringe and

[01:52:44] you manage to make me cringe if you
[01:52:47] manage to make me cringe yeah see you in
[01:52:49] [ __ ] see you in 30 minutes yep I'm
[01:52:53] sorry there's no need to exchange
[01:52:56] pleasantries there's no need to exchange
[01:52:58] pleasantries conversation just to occupy
[01:53:07] [Music]
[01:53:10] silence I don't think I've been here
[01:53:12] before have
[01:53:17] we uh one sec chat just something up
[01:53:21] okay we're
[01:53:23] good come out and face me
[01:53:28] ricey aren't we at an administrative
[01:53:31] office space why don't you at least try
[01:53:34] to follow even a couple rules from the
[01:53:36] fortress's indoor management regulations
[01:53:38] I know that guy what did you do to my
[01:53:40] sister I ran into the young Miss at the
[01:53:42] infirmary I'd heard that she was
[01:53:44] suffering from quite the migraine so I
[01:53:45] decided to invite her over for a cup of
[01:53:47] tea I do have some teas in in my
[01:53:50] collection that can work wonders against
[01:53:51] such an illness oh do you have some
[01:53:53] spare
[01:53:54] tea where did you take my
[01:53:56] siblings I have also heard that your
[01:53:59] performances are quite the spectacle
[01:54:02] Miss Lynette would sometimes enter a box
[01:54:04] filled with water only to emerge the
[01:54:06] next second from another place
[01:54:08] altogether if you want to emerge you
[01:54:10] right now if you were to turn your head
[01:54:13] is he trying to trick me into turning my
[01:54:15] head no he's probably not looking to
[01:54:18] attack me right now all of the hostages
[01:54:20] are in his hands and he's even in the
[01:54:22] mood for small talk that means Lynette
[01:54:25] is probably still alive you knew we were
[01:54:28] investigating the infirmary from the
[01:54:30] start so you deliberately aroused the
[01:54:32] Traveler's suspicions and baited us into
[01:54:34] continuing our investigation just so
[01:54:36] that you'd be able to kidnap
[01:54:40] Lynette as for
[01:54:42] fremin no you probably didn't even
[01:54:45] interfere with child's Escape you let
[01:54:47] him go so you could Purge the fatou
[01:54:49] members that we had planted into your
[01:54:51] ranks there was no need to do so the
[01:54:54] Fortress of meped is a pretty Pleasant
[01:54:57] Place most people enjoy their lives here
[01:55:00] the only ones who act differently are
[01:55:01] those with personal agendas it was quite
[01:55:04] easy to identify your colleagues you
[01:55:07] removed our original members and spread
[01:55:09] the news of child's Escape so father
[01:55:11] would assign our team to come down and
[01:55:13] investigate fremin has also fallen into
[01:55:15] your hands right if you're oh so
[01:55:18] omnipotent and so in control why would
[01:55:20] you need hostages yo low key though okay
[01:55:24] I'm not siding obviously we're siding
[01:55:26] with like L Lenny here cuz you know but
[01:55:28] lowkey kind of a gigachad move to just
[01:55:30] get like [ __ ] minus four fuis you
[01:55:33] just trapped three and you could have
[01:55:34] done whatever you wanted with child and
[01:55:36] you're probably baiting arino that's
[01:55:38] like minus
[01:55:44] five one correction they're literally
[01:55:46] children is in my hands right now but
[01:55:49] Firmin mean true
[01:55:54] but he's
[01:55:57] not what do you really
[01:56:00] want
[01:56:02] lny oh wonderful everyone is here so
[01:56:06] I'll only need to say this once thank
[01:56:08] you so much for cooperating with
[01:56:12] me they're not children well they're
[01:56:15] like arlino like I want to say tools I
[01:56:19] don't really know the L yet cuz we're
[01:56:20] only at act four but I feel like they
[01:56:22] are I feel like you you use like if
[01:56:24] anything you use them to bait
[01:56:27] arino where are lyette and
[01:56:31] from eager into the point I see alas
[01:56:35] only miss Lynette is currently having a
[01:56:36] cup of the fortress's finest
[01:56:39] tea although as per your original plan
[01:56:43] Mr frem should also have returned to the
[01:56:45] Fortress by now but he has neither shown
[01:56:48] up within my Gates nor has he been taken
[01:56:50] into any kind of custody so where do you
[01:56:53] think he may be right now he's diving
[01:56:56] he's a diver you can't mean you locked
[01:56:59] him outside in the sea oh well I was
[01:57:02] kidding I closed the fortress's gate to
[01:57:03] the outside world that's all frine is a
[01:57:07] star diver so he should be fine right no
[01:57:11] we're still here so we definitely try to
[01:57:14] find a way to come back for us so we
[01:57:16] can't assume he might have made a break
[01:57:17] for the surface but why would I do this
[01:57:20] you may be
[01:57:21] asking to have an audience with you of
[01:57:24] course my Intel tells me that Mr Linny
[01:57:27] is a great magician so it's only natural
[01:57:29] for me to want to have some cards of my
[01:57:31] own when it comes to
[01:57:33] negotiating besides I do recall you
[01:57:36] mentioning to miss Lynette that you've
[01:57:37] always wanted to have a face-to-face
[01:57:39] meeting with the Lord of The Fortress of
[01:57:41] marip you could have just asked of
[01:57:43] whether it was in a personal or a
[01:57:45] professional capacity well you got your
[01:57:48] wish oh I get get it rizzly okay he has
[01:57:51] a big brain a big ass respectfully so
[01:57:55] obviously you can't have a big heart you
[01:57:56] can't have all three that would be
[01:57:57] imbalanced so obviously he's acting
[01:58:00] without his heart here but he's using
[01:58:02] his brain so clearly because he's
[01:58:04] backloaded and there's that we have that
[01:58:06] information he won't factor in the
[01:58:08] feelings here because his heart okay
[01:58:10] that makes sense and then net is like
[01:58:11] the like that's where the okay us before
[01:58:13] we even set foot in the Fortress some of
[01:58:16] my folks just happen to hear a thing or
[01:58:18] two that's all
[01:58:19] in any case I will be straight with you
[01:58:22] I was willing to play dumb and turn a
[01:58:24] blind eye so we had a pleasant few days
[01:58:26] playing games together here but once you
[01:58:28] started focusing on the forbidden zone
[01:58:31] all of that changed Mr Linny the cards
[01:58:34] are stacked against you right now miss
[01:58:36] Lynette is in my hands and Mr fne is
[01:58:39] still slowly being pickled out there in
[01:58:41] the brine Dum you no justice why is fem
[01:58:44] getting pickled what the [ __ ] did fem do
[01:58:47] dude what did fem do wrong he's just
[01:58:50] he's just diving man he's just diving
[01:58:53] why is he getting pickled you need do
[01:58:54] but one thing to guarantee their
[01:58:57] safety I would like you to contact your
[01:58:59] Superior and ideally invite her over for
[01:59:02] a cup of tea with me you want to see
[01:59:06] father I literally okay maybe it was
[01:59:08] just obvious but I told you he he just
[01:59:10] traps he traps the kids well I know
[01:59:12] they're not technically kids but you
[01:59:13] know what I mean like AR Lino's kids to
[01:59:15] [ __ ] bait arino boom minus one
[01:59:17] fouille
[01:59:18] leader well if she cares for the
[01:59:21] well-being of her dearest children she
[01:59:23] should have plenty of motivation to join
[01:59:24] me for a parents evening I've heard that
[01:59:27] the bonds between the members of the
[01:59:29] House of the Hearth are like the bonds
[01:59:30] of family I don't see why she would
[01:59:33] refuse why did you think father sent us
[01:59:36] to handle the Fortress of marpit this
[01:59:38] place is basically a No Man's Land it
[01:59:41] wouldn't be fitting for anyone as
[01:59:42] important as a Harbinger like father to
[01:59:44] come here in person oh I see so it's
[01:59:49] because she doesn't care for my place
[01:59:51] here bam that's [ __ ] that's such a
[01:59:54] shame after all I've amassed quite the
[01:59:57] tea collection I was looking forward to
[01:59:59] sharing it with her both M nette and

[02:00:48] beginning the fouille has been actively

[02:00:58] the Fortress then and there I'd have no
[02:01:01] reason to want to talk Mr fremin left

[02:02:05] Fortress may be small and remote but it
[02:02:08] still has its own set of [ __ ] dude when
[02:02:10] I saw this option I thought we got to
[02:02:12] choose like I thought it was going to be
[02:02:13] like fanette and Lynette or like Lenny
[02:02:15] and Lynette like I thought we got to
[02:02:16] choose two that's the same option
[02:02:19] [Music]

[02:02:31] thing or two about what you found H I'll
[02:02:33] ask you three questions answer all of
[02:02:36] them correctly and I'll agree your
[02:02:38] questions it's fine I got this i got
[02:02:39] this regarding the hidden rules of the
[02:02:42] production Zone yeah what is the truth
[02:02:44] behind the one about not being allowed
[02:02:45] to work for 3 days in a row I remember
[02:02:48] this I remember this this not being
[02:02:50] allowed to work for 3 days in a
[02:02:54] row yeah you get the Strange meat okay
[02:02:59] cool what happens if you violate I'm not
[02:03:02] going to look at chat for this I'm not
[02:03:03] going to look at chat for this I'm not
[02:03:04] going to look at chat for this okay I'm
[02:03:05] not going to look at chat regarding the
[02:03:07] hdden rule of the production Zone the
[02:03:09] truth behind one about not being allowed
[02:03:10] to work for 3 days in a row what happens
[02:03:12] if you violate the production zones
[02:03:13] hidden rule if you break the hidden rule
[02:03:15] of the production Zone your welfare meal
[02:03:16] might contain some strange meat yes I
[02:03:18] remember
[02:03:20] oh what will you see if who will you see
[02:03:22] if you keep working continuously I've
[02:03:24] been told that the infirmary is always
[02:03:25] empty for the half hour just before
[02:03:28] lunch the font promoter has been
[02:03:31] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[02:03:33] the real value of coupons I remember
[02:03:35] doing this I did this on my phone in the
[02:03:36] train Duke believes that only idiots who
[02:03:39] don't understand the value of coupons
[02:03:41] would spend the mean just say idiots we
[02:03:43] often see Miss seen observing the
[02:03:45] prisoners at work font's internal
[02:03:47] reports suggest that they're starting a
[02:03:49] new trialed and unpackaged
[02:03:52] product the research notes said that the
[02:03:55] meloine race perceives the world very
[02:03:57] differently from humans because of that
[02:04:00] the according to Collins the pancre
[02:04:03] tournament only took place because the
[02:04:04] font company sponsored
[02:04:06] it okay okay so I know that the font was
[02:04:11] sus and I know that after 3 days we got
[02:04:14] a meal when we ordered it and then we
[02:04:16] just didn't eat it or some [ __ ] but I
[02:04:18] don't know if we saw saw someone maybe
[02:04:19] we saw s win I don't remember if we saw
[02:04:21] someone though for the half hour just
[02:04:23] before
[02:04:24] lunch oh maybe it's this that might be
[02:04:26] the clue has been struggling because he
[02:04:28] does we often see Miss observ this near
[02:04:32] production Zone wait it's actually
[02:04:34] definitely that F's internal rep I think
[02:04:35] it's this one
[02:04:39] often wait does it mean I got it I think
[02:04:41] I got it under what circumstances does a
[02:04:43] strange meat appear hey hey hey
[02:04:46] according to Collins the pancre
[02:04:49] we often see Str me promoter has been
[02:04:52] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[02:04:54] the real value of
[02:04:56] coupons so I remember we got strange
[02:04:58] meat we got uh a package in the mail
[02:05:01] with like blood or a potion or like
[02:05:03] something poison I don't know and there
[02:05:04] was another thing there's three sins
[02:05:06] that we did I just don't remember which
[02:05:07] was which one of them was like when we
[02:05:10] bet on both
[02:05:11] dudes yeah this one I remember we bet on
[02:05:13] two of the wrong things but I don't
[02:05:14] think the strange me was from that was
[02:05:16] it the font promoter has been SE Arch
[02:05:19] notes said that the M I'm going to click
[02:05:21] it but I don't think this is right oh my
[02:05:23] God I'm a [ __ ] genius if that means I
[02:05:25] won I don't know research why does the
[02:05:28] strange meat appear the way it
[02:05:29] does the Font because they're
[02:05:33] experimenting they're experimenting
[02:05:35] where is it they they're they're putting
[02:05:36] test subjects in our water new trial of
[02:05:39] an unnamed and unpackaged
[02:05:44] product okay I got the first one I got
[02:05:46] the first one W I got the first one see
[02:05:48] I got the first one I got the first one
[02:05:49] I might have [ __ ] up the last two cuz
[02:05:50] I didn't remember dude dude I thought
[02:05:52] the meat was from the first thing though
[02:05:53] but I actually got the first one did I
[02:05:56] miss any
[02:05:56] alerts no well only a few follows thanks
[02:05:59] for follows ha okay sorry uh under what
[02:06:02] C does strange meet appear I've been
[02:06:03] told that the infirmary is always empty
[02:06:05] for the half the font promoter has been
[02:06:07] struggling because he doesn't recognize
[02:06:09] the real value of coupon font's internal
[02:06:12] reports suggests that they're starting a
[02:06:14] new trial of an unnamed and unpackaged
[02:06:17] product but this why does the strange
[02:06:21] meet appear said that the wait I might
[02:06:24] have [ __ ] up I might have [ __ ] up it
[02:06:26] might have been Vice verter has
[02:06:28] struggling oh I [ __ ] up I think this
[02:06:30] one goes to the other one [ __ ] how do I
[02:06:32] change it go back go back go
[02:06:34] back okay so the the the testing wait
[02:06:37] was the huh why those internal
[02:06:40] reports why does the strange me do said
[02:06:43] that the meloine race perceives the
[02:06:45] world very differently from humans
[02:06:47] according to the pancre tournament only
[02:06:50] took place because the
[02:06:54] font okay let me think let me think this
[02:06:56] time okay full Focus this time I'm
[02:06:58] actually thinking oh wait it just shows
[02:07:00] me the
[02:07:03] answer oh no it doesn't okay I'm
[02:07:05] actually think I'm actually thinking why
[02:07:06] would the strange me dude it's when you
[02:07:08] break three rules or like when you break
[02:07:09] a rule like one of the Hidden rules I've
[02:07:11] been told that the infirmary is always
[02:07:13] empty for the half hour what is C making
[02:07:15] the [ __ ] shme the the bad meat the
[02:07:17] font promot has been struggling because
[02:07:19] he doesn't may a research notes said
[02:07:22] that the meloine race perceives the
[02:07:23] world very differently from humans okay
[02:07:26] maybe that's it maybe she's just
[02:07:28] poisoning the meat or some [ __ ] okay why
[02:07:29] does it strange meat appear that it does
[02:07:31] the Font promoter has been because the
[02:07:33] font wants good return on investment
[02:07:35] said that the meloine race perceives the
[02:07:37] world very differently from humans maybe
[02:07:39] it's this because of that the melines
[02:07:41] have also developed a sense of
[02:07:42] Aesthetics that appear rather strange
[02:07:44] and alien to humans it says appear and
[02:07:46] here it says appear so maybe that's a
[02:07:47] clue
[02:07:50] Jeepers
[02:07:53] yes sorry I'll calm down g g yeah yeah
[02:07:57] I'm sorry je Jee wouldn't react like
[02:07:59] that who would have
[02:08:03] guessed chat it's only two hours in the
[02:08:05] Stream I guess it's been three cuz my
[02:08:07] stream crashed and I already have to pee
[02:08:09] and taking off the Jean Causeway to pee
[02:08:11] is not easy the hidden rule of the
[02:08:13] production Zone people are not supposed
[02:08:17] to work 3 days in a row
[02:08:19] and will get strange meat in their
[02:08:22] welfare me the [ __ ] is Pon
[02:08:24] wearing at first we thought this strange
[02:08:27] meat must have something to do with the
[02:08:29] people who disappeared but in reality
[02:08:33] they were all prepared by seen the head
[02:08:41] nurse she often visits the production
[02:08:44] Zone to observe the workers's health and
[02:08:46] makes a note of anyone who has wor the
[02:08:48] themselves out after three full days of
[02:08:50] work out of her sense of Duty as the
[02:08:52] head nurse as well as her genuine
[02:08:54] concern for the worker's Health seen
[02:08:57] visits the cafeteria right before lunch
[02:08:59] and Cooks an extra dish for those who
[02:09:02] can use the stamina boost seen has only
[02:09:05] the best intentions with her surprise
[02:09:07] gift and doesn't want anyone to find out
[02:09:10] about what she does however
[02:09:13] unfortunately melines as a race perceive
[02:09:16] the world differently from humans and
[02:09:18] they her sense of Aesthetics is even the
[02:09:21] recipients of her lovingly prepared
[02:09:24] special meals cannot taste the care
[02:09:26] within and usually just freak out I mean
[02:09:29] that's wholesome but don't let her cook
[02:09:32] not bad can rizle headlock me covered
[02:09:35] secret and even guessed her intentions
[02:09:36] correctly as well it's nice to know that
[02:09:39] her efforts have not gone
[02:09:40] unacknowledged all right now for my next
[02:09:43] question oh god there are also some
[02:09:45] hidden rules in the pancre ring
[02:09:47] including the one that you're not
[02:09:48] allowed to both sides I have to pee
[02:09:50] before we do this I remember this one I
[02:09:52] remember this rule chat I have to go pee

[02:13:35] respectful dude my [ __ ] headset is
[02:13:42] stuck the hidden rules of the pank
[02:13:45] ration
[02:13:46] ring I remember if someone tries
[02:13:49] to wait chat remind before Act five
[02:13:51] we'll go we'll go stock up on on on on
[02:13:54] liquids okay yes I remember this we we
[02:13:56] we voted on both and we got blood well
[02:13:58] it's not blood but it was a weird liquid
[02:14:00] okay if you violate the rules you'll see
[02:14:02] a bag containing strange
[02:14:05] fluid cool I've been told that the
[02:14:07] infirmary is always EMP no it's not sein
[02:14:09] it's the font people I think that
[02:14:11] they're starting a new the font people
[02:14:14] they have they control the the the the
[02:14:18] so if you try to rig it they rig your
[02:14:24] life who sent the package at work the
[02:14:27] font promoter has been struggling
[02:14:29] because he doesn't recognize the real
[02:14:31] value of coupons the research note said
[02:14:34] the according to Collins the pancre
[02:14:36] tournament only took place because the
[02:14:39] wait but it says who so do I use
[02:14:41] promoter cuz this I mean I guess
[02:14:42] promoter sure uh why does the blood look
[02:14:44] the way it does cuz they're testing
[02:14:46] stuff report suggest that who ticket who
[02:14:52] do why do only those whose tickets to
[02:14:54] supp cuz they want a good return on
[02:14:56] investment true I'm
[02:14:59] a oh
[02:15:02] whoa yeah dude I literally had it right
[02:15:05] I just put them in the wrong order cuz
[02:15:06] it Doesn't dude I had the right
[02:15:07] hypothesis though I literally had the
[02:15:09] right
[02:15:13] hypothesis we often see
[02:15:16] Miss according to
[02:15:18] Collins I've been told that the
[02:15:20] infirmary is we often see Miss the font
[02:15:23] promoter
[02:15:25] has
[02:15:27] Eureka okay time to
[02:15:31] eat ah P gets this rule too now so there
[02:15:35] really was nothing to be afraid
[02:15:37] of that hidden rule of the pancre ring
[02:15:41] is about how um people are not supposed
[02:15:45] to bet on both boxers at the same time
[02:15:48] and if they do they'll receive a package
[02:15:50] containing a strange blood colored
[02:15:53] liquid people get scared when they see
[02:15:56] it because they've subconsciously begun
[02:15:58] to associate it with the missing
[02:16:04] boxer but really it's just a bottle of
[02:16:07] the latest yet to be named and packaged
[02:16:09] new font trial product a blood red drink
[02:16:14] it's no wonder even font's own staff
[02:16:16] were questioning the compan decision
[02:16:18] making the company facing backlash from
[02:16:21] its own staff decided to try to trial
[02:16:24] the product and a smaller scale to see
[02:16:26] how it might be received by customers
[02:16:29] they came to the Fortress of meped and
[02:16:32] offered to sponsor the pancre tournament
[02:16:34] so they could push their new product but
[02:16:37] the Duke completely refused to even
[02:16:39] entertain the idea the Duke knowing how
[02:16:42] valuable coupons are in The Fortress
[02:16:45] knew that only total idiots who didn't
[02:16:47] didn't understand their true value would
[02:16:49] bother buying a font product
[02:16:51] here and so only those who proved their
[02:16:55] stupidity by being dumb enough to bet on
[02:16:58] two opposing sides of the same match
[02:17:00] were selected to receive the drinks I
[02:17:03] acknowledge the that's kind of stupid Li
[02:17:05] bring the truth of this mystery to
[02:17:08] light although based on your description
[02:17:10] that font promoter is a bit too careless
[02:17:12] with his words I may just reconsider my
[02:17:15] collaboration with the company all right
[02:17:18] and here's the final question what's the
[02:17:21] secret behind our head nurse all of her
[02:17:24] patients in the
[02:17:28] infirmary oh we don't
[02:17:31] know she's actually a murderer she's
[02:17:34] [ __ ] she's no not
[02:17:38] CLE stop your cruel and pointless games
[02:17:41] risle she's cap you know that we haven't
[02:17:43] finished our investigation so there's no
[02:17:45] way we can answer the last question the
[02:17:47] thought of sparing Lynette and feminine
[02:17:49] never even crossed your
[02:17:51] mind Lenny you'll pay for this whoa

[02:21:35] the Fortress why is he looking like like
[02:21:41] this these symptoms it can't
[02:21:46] be
[02:21:50] elzahar acceler elazar Al what is that
[02:21:52] called I don't know consumed primordial

[02:22:42] back oh I'm just admiring your
[02:22:45] punctuality had you arrived just a few
[02:22:47] few minutes later sewe may have been
[02:22:48] forced to shoot Mr Linny
[02:22:58] again how's the situation out
[02:23:01] there the water has changed it's pretty
[02:23:04] much as expected the concentration of
[02:23:06] primordial sea water has increased
[02:23:08] significantly I was only out there a
[02:23:10] short time so it wasn't too bad but if
[02:23:13] one were to stay for any significant
[02:23:14] amount of time well you can see how that
[02:23:18] boy is doing where was he when you found
[02:23:22] him the abandoned Zone at the end of the
[02:23:24] pipes a good distance into the water
[02:23:27] closer than I thought he must have
[02:23:30] recognized it early on and tried
[02:23:31] desperately to swim back locking the
[02:23:34] door was necessary I don't think we
[02:23:36] could have saved two well I did try to
[02:23:38] convince him that I had my
[02:23:40] reasons never seems to work though it
[02:23:43] would probably work on net he has a
[02:23:46] knack for picking out who has had good
[02:23:47] intentions even when the outcomes were
[02:23:49] all
[02:23:50] terrible it's a bad sign if you're
[02:23:53] having to plead your case to noet want
[02:23:55] some
[02:23:57] tea what the why did he transition to
[02:23:59] want some yo RZ not particularly if you
[02:24:02] want to drinks them that badly just say
[02:24:04] so fine I'd like to get some tea want me
[02:24:08] to get you a cup too since I've already
[02:24:09] made
[02:24:12] it might as well then I suppose actually
[02:24:15] do you have a towel I will would like to
[02:24:17] dry my
[02:24:18] hair
[02:24:21] yo hey man can I have some tea too hey I

[02:25:00] us do you think if I roll an artifact
[02:25:02] next her will get
[02:25:04] lucky please please Claren Claren and
[02:25:08] rizzly like surely nothing can go wrong
[02:25:11] if
[02:25:15] CL
[02:25:21] lenn's expression looks disgusted it
[02:25:23] seems like he'd rather not have sein
[02:25:25] touch from still he didn't stop
[02:25:27] her Siege weans examined F carefully she
[02:25:30] doesn't look too upset which is a good
[02:25:31] sign I hope from will be okay how is he
[02:25:35] these symptoms are probably caused by an
[02:25:37] acute ingestion of a large amount of
[02:25:39] primordial
[02:25:41] seawater still his condition is not
[02:25:43] critical of course it would be best if
[02:25:46] he stayed for further observation let's
[02:25:49] leave him here for now and move him to
[02:25:51] the infirmary once he's recovered a bit
[02:25:53] more sorry I am aware that the infirmary
[02:25:56] may not be your favorite place in the
[02:25:58] world at the moment we do only have a
[02:26:01] single clinic in the Fortress
[02:26:07] however why would he ingest a large
[02:26:10] amount of primordial seawater after
[02:26:11] leaving the Fortress how could that
[02:26:14] possibly happen please look after Mr f
[02:26:17] for the moment I'll go fetch some
[02:26:19] medicine and a respirator oh I'll bring
[02:26:22] Miss Lynette back with me where is she
[02:26:25] how is she right now oh she just took a
[02:26:28] nap in an empty room after I
[02:26:30] tranquilized her if my calculations are
[02:26:33] correct she should also be waking up
[02:26:35] right around now you might not believe
[02:26:37] me but his grace and I some snacks and
[02:26:40] tea for
[02:26:44] her why'd you tranquilize Lynette
[02:26:48] lyette would have
[02:26:50] cooperated she's on mean Linny are you
[02:26:57] okay I'll be fine they're all here now
[02:27:01] don't worry about
[02:27:03] me are you sure you don't look all
[02:27:07] right my hands and feet are still a bit
[02:27:10] weak but that's probably just the
[02:27:13] residual effects of the tranquilizer
[02:27:15] shot I'm back everyone
[02:27:19] oh Lynette Lenny hi
[02:27:21] Lynette traveler

[02:40:52] whatever but why didn't he just put his
[02:40:54] diver mask on some time after that is
[02:40:56] that his whole thing and you know the
[02:41:00] rest
[02:41:02] Moon than the four months Hydro the N9
[02:41:05] months I even I the tier
[02:41:10] one miss cland brought you back but we
[02:41:13] also don't know why she just suddenly
[02:41:15] appeared The Fortress or why she went
[02:41:17] out to save
[02:41:19] you that wouldn't do anything it would
[02:41:22] still touch his skin I
[02:41:24] see wait but can't you just be a Pro

[02:41:30] can't you if you're like okay can't okay
[02:41:32] can't you just go diver gear and then
[02:41:34] you have your own air tank and then
[02:41:35] you're not like your skin is full of
[02:41:37] like like latex or like whatever the
[02:41:39] [ __ ] your suit is no okay I don't know

[02:45:19] stabilized of course I wouldn't have
[02:45:21] left the infirmary otherwise I've been
[02:45:24] expecting those two but might I inquire
[02:45:26] as to the purpose of your visit Miss
[02:45:29] seen I wanted to check up on Miss claran
[02:45:32] how are you feeling mostly fine I
[02:45:36] think if you don't mind I'd like to
[02:45:38] perform another quick physical exam
[02:45:41] it'll just take a few minutes all right
[02:45:44] thank you for looking out for me I'll
[02:45:46] take my leave for now she do not need
[02:45:48] you little bro well want to explain
[02:45:50] yourself
[02:45:53] Risley of course but I'm not partial to
[02:45:56] the word choice of
[02:45:58] explain how about Enlighten okay please
[02:46:02] enlighten us then where should I
[02:46:04] begin how about you start by asking me
[02:46:07] any questions you have you can start
[02:46:09] with whichever one you'd like to get
[02:46:10] answered the
[02:46:12] most then Pon will begin did you you
[02:46:15] know about Lenny's goals from the very
[02:46:16] beginning no I just knew they were
[02:46:19] fouille operatives sent to the Fortress
[02:46:21] by the Nave as for their specific goals
[02:46:25] I only figured those out as you made
[02:46:26] progress on your investigation you
[02:46:29] managed to Monitor and stay ahead of
[02:46:31] them even though you didn't know what
[02:46:32] they were trying to do they came here
[02:46:35] with ulterior motives I'm quite Adept at
[02:46:37] Discerning what that kind of behavior
[02:46:40] signals why didn't you stop them
[02:46:42] initially I thought their goal was just
[02:46:43] to investigate child's disappearance
[02:46:46] Linny suggested that I had deliberately
[02:46:47] let him Escape but in truth I didn't
[02:46:50] really do anything special to help or
[02:46:52] hinder him while he was here everything
[02:46:54] he did from finding helpers to leaving
[02:46:56] this place he did on his own what the
[02:46:58] [ __ ] is not looking at that the Nave
[02:47:00] would make a big deal fellow harbinger's
[02:47:03] unexplained
[02:47:05] disappearance I'm also quite curious
[02:47:07] about where that Harbinger went so I
[02:47:09] figured I might as well let the fouille
[02:47:11] do their own investigative work oh did I
[02:47:16] so you were hoping Lenny's group would
[02:47:18] just do your work for
[02:47:19] you you make it sound like that's a bad
[02:47:22] thing unfortunately things didn't go as
[02:47:25] planned I assume that fem has told you
[02:47:27] already the ratio of primordial seawater
[02:47:30] around the Fortress of mpede is on the
[02:47:31] rise the forbidden zone has always been
[02:47:34] Lenny's Target and you got roped into
[02:47:36] that investigation after running into
[02:47:37] him I began to intervene out of concern
[02:47:40] for your safety and also to prevent The
[02:47:42] Fortress from becoming entangled in more
[02:47:44] work some matters are the rumors true
[02:47:48] that you're also a former
[02:47:50] criminal now why would you put it like
[02:47:52] that isn't staying here all day and
[02:47:54] serving as the manager of the Fortress a
[02:47:56] kind of sentence unto itself another
[02:47:58] form of prison I just happen to have
[02:48:01] some support from the rest of the
[02:48:02] inmates that's all oh right I want me of
[02:48:06] course oh [ __ ] who invited Claren me her
[02:48:08] good Mora to come down to the Fortress
[02:48:10] for some fieldwork okay based as a
[02:48:12] champion dualist Miss claran could be
[02:48:14] considered to be an independent party I
[02:48:17] needed to find an exceptionally capable
[02:48:19] person to help me get through the crisis
[02:48:22] and saving F was part of that crisis you
[02:48:25] can think of it like that yes credit
[02:48:28] where credit is due that boy is quite
[02:48:30] Adept at diving well clearly not they
[02:48:34] were calm down he probably would have
[02:48:36] found the missing Harbinger
[02:48:40] already so the fer Zone really exists
[02:48:42] what's inside of it that's not something
[02:48:44] something you should be asking after net
[02:48:47] only asked you to investigate child's
[02:48:50] whereabouts nearly drowned it's not
[02:48:52] funny it is funny I mean I feel bad but
[02:48:54] it is
[02:48:55] funny someone could nearly drown in game
[02:48:57] and still be
[02:48:59] funny I don't want him to drown it's
[02:49:01] still funny though that the character
[02:49:03] who's the diver almost drowned I mean
[02:49:04] like I get it I get why it's still funny
[02:49:10] though all I need to prove is that the
[02:49:12] fen Zone had nothing to do with the
[02:49:13] harer disappearance that should be clear
[02:49:15] now that you've spoken to Froman
[02:49:18] a you drowned in fanten okay why would
[02:49:21] you bring that up why would you bring
[02:49:22] that
[02:49:24] up why would you bring that
[02:49:27] up do you know who wouldn't have drowned
[02:49:30] kakomi cuz she's not from fontin so she
[02:49:32] doesn't she's not a [ __ ] fake and a
[02:49:34] fraud who can't swim in certain Waters
[02:49:36] she could swim in any water and walk on
[02:49:38] it
[02:49:41] true but we've already uncovered that
[02:49:44] the there's something wrong with the
[02:49:45] infirmary and we've answered a bunch of
[02:49:47] questions that you threw at us isn't it
[02:49:50] about time that you answer our last
[02:49:51] question in return yeah make a
[02:49:53] compelling
[02:49:54] case do you really want to know the
[02:49:56] answer that badly yes Pon really wants
[02:49:59] to know even if the truth may not be
[02:50:01] pleasant uh-oh follow me oh no I mean
[02:50:09] [Music]
[02:50:11] yes no clar's gone sad
[02:50:15] she'll be
[02:50:23] back yo there's a hidden door here and a
[02:50:27] whole basement behind it this is my
[02:50:29] stream setup I actually stream from ry's
[02:50:31] basement this actually like the
[02:50:32] staircase that's the staircase I'm
[02:50:34] actually streaming yeah just so you
[02:50:37] know the The Jig Is
[02:50:40] Up This is actually where my stream set
[02:50:42] up look you'll see look you'll see this
[02:50:44] my stream set up up
[02:50:46] yep stand on the central plate wait is
[02:50:50] there a secret mechanism or whoa
[02:50:57] whoa once everyone had taken the
[02:50:59] positions on the circular L pled it
[02:51:01] began to move
[02:51:04] downwards
[02:51:06] okay so this is the forbidden zone
[02:51:10] honestly for a place so well hidden pman
[02:51:13] sure doesn't see child never mind big
[02:51:16] door there are three such isolation
[02:51:19] gates in total generally speaking I'm
[02:51:22] the only one who's allowed to go inside
[02:51:24] hence the name forbidden zone am I
[02:51:28] correct to assume you're going to run on
[02:51:29] back and tell your little foule friends
[02:51:31] everything they're not my friends man I
[02:51:35] my M wasn't thinking of keeping anything
[02:51:37] from
[02:51:38] them well I advise you wait until
[02:51:41] actually no I guess we're friends you're
[02:51:42] right we're friends I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:51:44] we're friends not to tell
[02:51:49] them wait a
[02:51:51] second why am I wait a second wait is
[02:51:54] this my build okay get me all fa if I
[02:51:57] get to play my own character yeah yeah
[02:51:59] we're going Jade cutter yep get me off
[02:52:04] fa this isn't a [ __ ] zff stream get
[02:52:07] me on a real weapon so there's a switch
[02:52:09] on the side stand
[02:52:13] back
[02:52:20] why are you gearing dude shut up one by
[02:52:23] one what's in the middle of that room
[02:52:25] have a look you guys think I could be
[02:52:28] rizzly no who am I
[02:52:32] kidding okay that
[02:52:37] was this room is also empty in the here
[02:52:39] there guy CH on its own there's also a
[02:52:41] device smacked out in the middle of the
[02:52:42] roomed in what lies beyond that gate
[02:52:44] ever since I assumed leadership of the
[02:52:46] Fortress of meped of course it would be
[02:52:48] unwise to recklessly open it but it'
[02:52:51] also be risky and negligent to Simply
[02:52:53] ignore any potential danger that could
[02:52:55] be behind it the readings on that
[02:52:57] dashboard have not budged since the day
[02:52:59] when I first laid eyes on this place but
[02:53:02] over the past year the needle has crept
[02:53:05] upwards from its original position
[02:53:07] likely because some parameter it's been
[02:53:09] tracking has changed if only
[02:53:11] infinitesimally
[02:53:13] infinites but happen to have some free
[02:53:15] this big words so I
[02:53:17] investigated any guesses what the
[02:53:19] reading could be
[02:53:24] tracking the pressure very reasonable
[02:53:27] guesses I've considered both of those as
[02:53:29] well unfortunately our dashboard is
[02:53:32] tracking something less ordinary the
[02:53:34] temperature should vary with weather and
[02:53:36] climate changes so for something that
[02:53:38] rarely climate change genin God woke I'm
[02:53:41] sorry we ran a few tests to increase the
[02:53:43] pressure from the outside
[02:53:45] the readings didn't change at all later
[02:53:47] on a few more possibilities occurred to
[02:53:49] me such as a potential connection with
[02:53:51] the primordial sea I began to make a few
[02:53:54] preparations based on that hypothesis
[02:53:56] okay the past few days the needle has
[02:53:58] moved again with that and the symptoms
[02:54:00] that frem displayed after leaving the
[02:54:03] Fortress I can now confidently conclude
[02:54:05] that the readings represent the
[02:54:07] concentration of primordial seawater in
[02:54:09] the seawater nearby the concentration of
[02:54:12] I mean that makes sense yeah there
[02:54:14] sea water but we're already under the
[02:54:17] sea and that is precisely the problem
[02:54:20] under the SE
[02:54:21] sea yo I want to play that one
[02:54:24] Seca Under the seial Sea got mixed in
[02:54:28] and the concentration is steadily
[02:54:40] Rising dmca oh [ __ ] you're right
[02:54:43] actually I can't play it okay whatever
[02:54:46] and that's precisely the problem we're
[02:54:47] out the bottom of the sea and now we're
[02:54:48] surrounded by toxic seawat somehow
[02:54:50] primordial sea water got mixed in and
[02:54:52] the concentration is steadily Rising
[02:54:54] primordial seawat is continually leaking
[02:54:56] into the sea question mark yes but
[02:54:59] forget about the two of us not even
[02:55:01] novet knows where the primordial sea
[02:55:03] could be much less where we could find a
[02:55:05] plug a
[02:55:07] oh oh seems like you figured it out I
[02:55:11] believe the primordial sea lies directly
[02:55:13] beneath this SLO gate for some reason
[02:55:16] the primordial seawater levels have
[02:55:18] risen significantly and it's now very
[02:55:20] close to us the indicators are now red
[02:55:24] although the gate still stands some
[02:55:26] primordial seawat has already leaked out
[02:55:28] and mixed into the sea around us can't
[02:55:30] you test it continues just truck someone
[02:55:32] we don't
[02:55:33] like soon it will no longer be able to
[02:55:36] yo get Reckless no he's not from I was
[02:55:38] going to say leg but L's a homie I don't
[02:55:40] know just get someone from font that you
[02:55:42] don't like like a criminal
[02:55:45] and if the primordial sea is leaking
[02:55:47] through if this gate Falls all the font
[02:55:50] will fall with
[02:55:51] it yeah you know what the Legends say if
[02:55:55] this place Falls then everyone in
[02:55:56] Fontaine will be turned into puddles in
[02:55:58] the span of a night but that's just too
[02:56:02] weird why would the Fortress of mpede be
[02:56:04] built right above a SLO gate for the
[02:56:06] primordial sea who built this place
[02:56:09] anyway good question P expression tells
[02:56:12] me you think this might be part of a
[02:56:13] vast complic at
[02:56:15] conspiracy to be honest you might find
[02:56:17] the actual answer may be exceeding chat
[02:56:20] Pepa P I guess that was a bad question
[02:56:22] been long forgotten by the nation before
[02:56:24] I actually don't know who built this
[02:56:26] there's no single founder of the
[02:56:28] Fortress of mar any traditional sense
[02:56:31] what we know about its history has been
[02:56:33] Left To Us by the people who used to
[02:56:34] live here sure when the previous Hydro
[02:56:36] archon aeria Ruled the Land all
[02:56:39] convicted criminals from Fontaine were
[02:56:41] exiled the people the criminals away
[02:56:44] like a wolf pack chasing away the banish
[02:56:46] CH if I Google aeria will I get spoilers
[02:56:48] who the [ __ ]
[02:56:50] is L Skipper did they talk about aeria
[02:56:53] before yes okay I won't look it up the
[02:56:56] hell wait a second Nita let me call
[02:56:59] Nita Nita hello yeah I just learned
[02:57:02] about the previous Hydra archon aeria
[02:57:04] I'm wondering do you know anything about
[02:57:05] a previous dendro archon no does like uh
[02:57:08] Ruka devada ring a
[02:57:10] bell n's dead sorry that was I wouldn't
[02:57:13] do that
[02:57:15] okay Nigeria all convicted criminals
[02:57:17] were exiled he will drove the criminals
[02:57:19] away like a wolf
[02:57:21] pack Wolf the criminals receive no isn't
[02:57:25] dead no she's not but if you if you
[02:57:27] mention Rada Seaside where they experi
[02:57:30] pain so don't mention it and the
[02:57:32] chilling
[02:57:35] cold apologize I'm sorry I like
[02:57:43] Nita
[02:57:46] some of them began to repent repent and
[02:57:48] prayed to the hydro archon asking if
[02:57:50] there was still anything they could
[02:57:53] do the hydro archon took pity on them
[02:57:56] and said you may go guard my secret deep
[02:58:00] underneath the waves and so leaning on
[02:58:03] the power of the hydro archon they
[02:58:05] gathered underneath the sea and began to
[02:58:07] build a fortress they became a community
[02:58:10] down there in the deeps and over the
[02:58:12] years helped it to grow as the number of
[02:58:14] Exiles increased more and more people
[02:58:17] joined the community when the first
[02:58:19] group of Exiles died they left the yet
[02:58:21] unfinished Fortress to their
[02:58:24] successors the hydro archon continued to
[02:58:27] lend her support allowing The Fortress
[02:58:29] and what it stood for to continue
[02:58:31] growing ever
[02:58:32] larger before long this dark underwater
[02:58:36] Fortress became the sinner's only home
[02:58:39] and with that the people here stopped
[02:58:41] referring to the Fortress as a prison
[02:58:44] they saw themselves as repenting Sinners
[02:58:46] who would regain their freedom once they
[02:58:48] had sufficiently redeemed themselves But
[02:58:50] as time went on people also realized
[02:58:53] that the Fortress was a lonely Place
[02:58:56] once they had gotten used to life here
[02:58:57] they could no longer feel comfortable
[02:58:59] living in the Overworld once they had
[02:59:01] finished serving their sentences some
[02:59:03] people left and some others chose to
[02:59:05] stay they'd find some idle position and
[02:59:07] let their withered Souls fade away with
[02:59:09] the ancient secrets of the Past after
[02:59:12] many many centuries
[02:59:14] few people still remember the reason for
[02:59:16] the Fortress Is founding now they just
[02:59:18] see it as an integral pillar of fonan
[02:59:21] society as the place where criminals
[02:59:22] deserve to be sent now and again
[02:59:25] researchers manag to break one law or
[02:59:27] another and live out their days in the
[02:59:29] Fortress I learned all this from an
[02:59:32] elderly historian everyone else just
[02:59:35] thought what if he did make make it up
[02:59:36] and then just rly believe though every
[02:59:38] part of that history is true never mind
[02:59:41] indeed it's just as the prophecy says
[02:59:44] you believe in prophecies if to be frank
[02:59:46] not
[02:59:47] really but sadly that hasn't stopped
[02:59:49] this Prophecy from proving all too
[02:59:51] accurate prophecies are Troublesome
[02:59:54] things just hearing one will create the
[02:59:56] first wave of panic seeing signs of it
[02:59:59] will bring about the second and actually
[03:00:00] witnessing it in real time the
[03:00:04] third so as the Duke of mpede just what
[03:00:07] do you plan to do about it let's go
[03:00:09] somewhere else I want to show you okay
[03:00:12] stay here Pon sorry
[03:00:20] sorry chat if I look to my other monitor

[03:00:28] deal wait Jor he's not alone oh it's

[03:00:44] this someone wrote gagee but different
[03:00:47] gender how is this
[03:00:53] Gage I mean maybe but the results speak
[03:00:57] for themselves don't they these two may
[03:01:00] already know more than you could ever
[03:01:01] imagine all right then if your grace
[03:01:04] insists they seem harmless enough so
[03:01:07] I'll trust them for
[03:01:09] now [ __ ] my cosplay just how about some
[03:01:12] introductions this is Jor one of the
[03:01:14] highest ranked researchers from the
[03:01:16] Fontaine Research Institute he used to
[03:01:18] work under Edwin I trust that you've
[03:01:20] heard of Edwin Edwin van CLE the [ __ ]
[03:01:23] the
[03:01:26] Rogue he's the one who blew the whole
[03:01:28] Institute Sky High everyone knew he was
[03:01:31] a bit crooked in the head but you're not
[03:01:34] a local so I guess it's possible for you
[03:01:36] not to have heard of him Edwin's May why
[03:01:39] does he talk like that Chad do I sound
[03:01:40] like him be honest as his assistant Jer

[03:02:25] just using your work as a no they're
[03:02:27] actually Canon I your grace I am not in
[03:02:32] a relationship with this man if I dated
[03:02:35] her I'd officially be madder than Edwin
[03:02:37] why does he sound like that
[03:02:40] dude if I dated her I'd officially be
[03:02:44] madder than Edwin jeez forget I said
[03:02:47] anything then follow me yes sir whoa
[03:02:52] there's another door that goes right up
[03:02:54] your constant amazement makes it seem
[03:02:56] like the Fortress can do
[03:03:02] anything but Pon really thinks
[03:03:04] everything's super
[03:03:08] cool is this just a normal
[03:03:11] room wait till you
[03:03:14] a bit and here you
[03:03:18] go yo yo yo what's
[03:03:21] about what a
[03:03:23] huge B ship this is also a production
[03:03:26] Zone that P's never seen before what's
[03:03:29] going on how much do you know about
[03:03:31] Fontan history I don't I don't know not
[03:03:35] much why the [ __ ] would I learn about
[03:03:36] [ __ ] font maybe you haven't heard the
[03:03:38] story of ancient
[03:03:40] lamura to give you a quick rundown
[03:03:42] Fontaine used used to be ruled by the
[03:03:44] luran dynasty according to Legend the
[03:03:47] luran king Reus came to this land after
[03:03:50] being inspired by divine revelation and
[03:03:53] found the Seer saila who had taken on
[03:03:55] the form of a golden bee taking the
[03:03:58] Golden Bee with him and riding on a huge
[03:04:00] ship the Fortuna he created his Nation
[03:04:04] above the surging waves okay will this
[03:04:05] be on the will this be on the test his
[03:04:06] Nation Lura okay and used the Fortuna to
[03:04:09] incessantly search for new tribes and
[03:04:12] Islands calling on them to join his
[03:04:14] Empire there's a ship in this story
[03:04:17] too where there's water there'll be
[03:04:20] ships people believe that hope can
[03:04:22] always be found at the end of a voyage
[03:04:25] do you believe that to a point I think
[03:04:28] as you've already seen I have a whole
[03:04:29] Factor's worth of labor materials and
[03:04:31] Technology at my disposal certainly
[03:04:34] can't hurt to give it a try so the
[03:04:36] moment I began to speculate that the
[03:04:38] primordial sea might lie underneath the
[03:04:40] gate I also began this project were you
[03:04:43] inspired by the legendary
[03:04:46] Fortuna maybe fontans need something to
[03:04:49] hold on to to cope withing
[03:04:52] disaster true this is a plan for the
[03:04:54] ages why can't you share it with
[03:04:56] everyone wait they literally rebuilt
[03:04:58] Noah's Arc the workers to find out the
[03:05:00] truth behind this ship riots would
[03:05:02] destroy the Fortress faster than any
[03:05:04] catastrophe as the fortress's
[03:05:05] administrator I'd never bro is Noah all
[03:05:09] right that's enough talking for now I'll
[03:05:11] need another three cups of tea to Soothe
[03:05:13] My Throat do you have any other
[03:05:15] questions chy why does your throat hurt
[03:05:17] so much seems like you're good come on
[03:05:20] I'll take you
[03:05:30] back I'll leave you here oh uh thank you
[03:05:35] no worries but don't forget I like G you
[03:05:37] whether or not you want to share what
[03:05:38] you just saw what you do from here on
[03:05:41] out will likely affect those three as as
[03:05:44] well he means that my actions now will
[03:05:46] decide the next steps Lenny's group
[03:05:47] takes wait actually decisions matter in
[03:05:51] gen yeah we'll put a lot of thought into
[03:05:54] it for sure yes we will I look yes
[03:05:58] decisions matter surely surely it wasn't
[03:06:01] just it actually means decision matter
[03:06:03] please act for complete act for complete
[03:06:06] act
[03:06:12] behold
[03:06:16] we're back welcome back do you want a
[03:06:19] cup of tea why does everyone keep
[03:06:20] offering me tea be so much like Risley
[03:06:22] always drinking tea huh actually now
[03:06:27] that you mention it I just remembered
[03:06:29] something now while I was dat I could
[03:06:32] still barely hear two people talking
[03:06:34] next to me they were discussing
[03:06:36] everything from the leaves to the water
[03:06:39] and even the teacups themselves must
[03:06:42] have been right Ry and seen what if it's
[03:06:45] code yeah I heard one male voice and one
[03:06:49] female so it should have been the two of
[03:06:52] them they really were just talking about
[03:06:55] brewing tea I really can't make sense of
[03:06:59] this place so traveler Pimon were you
[03:07:02] able to learn anything from Risley yeah
[03:07:05] he explained everything very well then
[03:07:09] would you mind checking your answers
[03:07:10] against my
[03:07:11] speculations feeling better now L yeah I
[03:07:14] took the time to rest so I'm feeling a
[03:07:17] lot more relaxed now nobody else is
[03:07:19] around and Miss seen is also busy with
[03:07:22] something or other so let's just talk
[03:07:24] here all right then I'll posit my
[03:07:28] theories I asked myself three questions
[03:07:31] firstly why was fremin affected by the
[03:07:34] primordial seawater it was because he
[03:07:37] dove into the sea my theory is the long
[03:07:41] lost primordial sea we already figured
[03:07:42] that like two cut scenes
[03:07:46] ago okay good good
[03:07:49] theory he's good that's AR Linny
[03:07:52] secondly risley's attitude changed
[03:07:55] dramatically during the course of our
[03:07:56] stay here he ignored us completely at
[03:07:59] first then suddenly roadblocked us why I
[03:08:02] spent quite a long time thinking about
[03:08:05] this if he has been monitoring the
[03:08:07] fouille since the very beginning he
[03:08:09] probably ignored us at first because he
[03:08:11] was hoping we could find master child
[03:08:13] for him what's more The Fortress of
[03:08:16] marpit is not part of fontaine's court
[03:08:18] system nor does it report to udc's
[03:08:21] nervet Risley is basically the king of
[03:08:24] No Man's Land as long as the Fortress
[03:08:26] doesn't do anything about master child's
[03:08:28] disappearance father can use it to
[03:08:30] pressure the Fontaine authorities and
[03:08:33] while the two factions are pitted
[03:08:34] against each other Risley will be free
[03:08:37] to move between the parties of interest
[03:08:39] if I had to guess he probably has
[03:08:42] something that he's working on himself
[03:08:44] it's likely related to The Secret of the
[03:08:46] infirmary but I just can't think of what
[03:08:49] it could
[03:08:50] be D Lenny Lenny was a cut scene Skipper
[03:08:53] but he he got a good he got a good he
[03:08:55] got a good read thanks so much then
[03:08:59] finally there's the last question if
[03:09:02] Risley does have a plan what could it be
[03:09:05] all I know for now is that his plan
[03:09:07] probably has something to do with the
[03:09:08] changing nature of the seawater he's
[03:09:11] even gotten claran to help him out
[03:09:13] ah the full extent of what he's doing
[03:09:17] there's probably a secret passageway
[03:09:18] behind the Block in the infirmary and
[03:09:20] there's something big in the Fortress
[03:09:22] that most people here never get to see
[03:09:25] he has a bargaining chip and it could be
[03:09:27] important enough for father to deal with
[03:09:29] him directly I don't have enough
[03:09:31] information so I have no idea it's a
[03:09:34] dragon true but she has let me guess you
[03:09:39] have the last piece of the puzzle well
[03:09:41] it's a [ __ ] but it could have been a
[03:09:42] dragon
[03:09:47] you emphasize that now is not the time
[03:09:48] for disputes it's very important to take
[03:09:49] the matter I can't believe it
[03:09:53] the will engulf everyone yeah just like
[03:09:56] lightning just like the prophecy I know
[03:09:58] it's tragic man first engulfing
[03:10:00] lightning wanted to meet father to
[03:10:01] figure out a way to deal with this
[03:10:03] crisis if you remember I once mentioned
[03:10:06] that father sees the house of the Hearth
[03:10:07] as her base of operations and she truly
[03:10:10] wants to resolve the crisis but how
[03:10:12] could Risley have known that or perhaps
[03:10:15] he didn't know and just wanted to bring
[03:10:17] father over to his side which could be
[03:10:20] why he said he just wanted to
[03:10:22] negotiate yeah that makes sense to me I
[03:10:26] understand your concerns as well
[03:10:27] traveler I'll figure out a way to pass
[03:10:29] this on to our father no matter what
[03:10:32] we're on your
[03:10:34] side the two of you have already aided
[03:10:36] us far too much we probably wouldn't be
[03:10:39] standing here right now if not for you
[03:10:41] if you ever need anything else going for
[03:10:42] forward please come to the house of the
[03:10:44] he at any where the [ __ ] is the house of

[03:27:16] apple that is a very long seed for an
[03:27:17] orange I think it's a it's it's a orange

[03:27:52] to propose just cuz you might as well
[03:27:55] like it's it's a highrisk low risk High
[03:28:01] reward so this is the Nave the head of
[03:28:04] the House of Hearth and the Linny
[03:28:06] siblings father she certainly does not
[03:28:07] seem to be to deal with greetings
[03:28:09] pleasure to meet you I've already
[03:28:10] prepared seats for you you come sit
[03:28:12] beside me perhaps you two are unaware of
[03:28:15] how Miss finina and I do things you see
[03:28:18] we actually recently agreed to get
[03:28:20] together for tea when we had the
[03:28:24] time I like her colors I like the like
[03:28:27] black white red I guess that's gray not
[03:28:29] white ah it's white
[03:28:34] gray her hands aren't gloves by the way
[03:28:36] yeah I remember hearing that which is
[03:28:38] actually pretty
[03:28:40] sick
[03:28:42] see this this is a limited type of
[03:28:45] confectioner that Miss finina simply
[03:28:48] adors there are only 16 slices sold
[03:28:51] every day here why don't you and Pon
[03:28:55] have a
[03:28:58] taste she seems friendly enough but that
[03:29:00] can't be all there is her the na is a
[03:29:02] force to be reckoned with I should be
[03:29:03] very
[03:29:04] cautious I mean we're basically best
[03:29:06] friends with child and he's a [ __ ]
[03:29:07] fatou so we're chilling traveler what do
[03:29:10] you think of this cas
[03:29:11] also wander is our friend now that's two
[03:29:13] now we have a third one boom three of
[03:29:15] the harmers are
[03:29:17] friends it's pretty good that's good to
[03:29:20] hear so what child said was on the mark
[03:29:23] after all you do share a taste in
[03:29:26] desserts with fena and
[03:29:30] I wonder is redacted I mean oh I was
[03:29:35] Ling that's good to hear so what CH said
[03:29:37] was on the mark after all you do share a
[03:29:38] taste in desserts wait Chach know no
[03:29:41] reason to have said something like that
[03:29:42] I wonder how he's doing
[03:29:44] nowadays you must have heard right he's
[03:29:47] suddenly gone
[03:29:49] missing I'm really worried about his
[03:29:51] safety you know here's to hoping that
[03:29:54] he's an excellent
[03:29:57] swimmer I have faith in his abilities
[03:29:59] but if he's not a good swimmer and you
[03:30:01] need someone just to replace him uh
[03:30:04] since we are talking about him I feel
[03:30:06] like I should add something his Marshall
[03:30:09] prowess really looked
[03:30:11] certainly pretty impressive
[03:30:14] [Music]
[03:30:18] yeah uhoh dude fina's face she looks so
[03:30:22] worried look at her poor
[03:30:25] finina you okay finina you need a hug oh
[03:30:29] so you are also familiar with his
[03:30:31] aptitude for fighting Miss
[03:30:33] finina oh right I almost forgot child
[03:30:37] was subdued by udc's nuet right in front
[03:30:40] of you against Ordinary People my
[03:30:42] colleague would never be on the back
[03:30:44] foot but alas he just never imagined
[03:30:48] he'd run into such a
[03:30:52] person I must express my admiration for
[03:30:55] Monsour nuet I manag find a few
[03:30:58] leads coming from you that's not
[03:31:01] surprising at
[03:31:05] all uh but I thought you would be
[03:31:09] happier to hear the news of course but
[03:31:12] it's still a bit of a shame you see I
[03:31:15] would have been far happier had I
[03:31:17] received this news somewhat earlier as
[03:31:19] you well know a long time has passed
[03:31:23] since child
[03:31:26] disappeared yo is she okay uh well in
[03:31:29] any case there's no need to worry we
[03:31:32] know for sure that child is still alive
[03:31:34] oh and just how do you know
[03:31:38] that because
[03:31:41] uh because we found evidence that proved
[03:31:44] he left the Fortress of mpede and where
[03:31:46] did he go after leaving the
[03:31:48] Fortress
[03:31:54] well the Fortress of meped Lies deep
[03:31:57] beneath the waves unless he pranced
[03:32:00] right out he's in the abyss we saw the
[03:32:01] trailer I saw skirk in the trailer he's
[03:32:03] in the abyss I'm sorry I'm sorry I saw
[03:32:05] the trailer I saw the
[03:32:09] trailer
[03:32:11] but there was also no evidence he's been
[03:32:13] injured or killed spoil did trailers
[03:32:15] always spoil you man it's like I was
[03:32:17] watching a fast and furious movie like
[03:32:18] five years ago and before the movie I
[03:32:20] saw a trailer that had an airplane
[03:32:22] [ __ ] driving on a railway like a road

[03:32:27] bro the movie was like going to end I
[03:32:28] was like wait I haven't seen the
[03:32:29] airplane Yet the movie can't end and
[03:32:32] then surely enough pla twizz there's a
[03:32:34] [ __ ] airplane sorry trailers suck
[03:32:37] limbo s for the raid I appreciate but
[03:32:39] there was no evidence that he's been
[03:32:40] injured or
[03:32:41] killed that is good news at least his
[03:32:44] sister Tonia sent a letter to not too

[03:36:09] right
[03:36:21] bro
[03:36:23] what the [ __ ] is
[03:36:29] happening he's holding
[03:36:33] me a day may come when the prophecy is
[03:36:37] fulfilled and the waters burst forth but
[03:36:40] it is not this
[03:36:44] day this ancient power could easily
[03:36:47] obliterate an entire
[03:36:50] race the tsunami of Fury would unleash
[03:36:54] endless
[03:37:00] [Music]
[03:37:09] catastrophe
[03:37:10] this sentence is too
[03:37:12] severe forgive me for overruling
[03:37:22] it
[03:37:24] yo what the
[03:37:26] [ __ ] yo this guy's actually [ __ ]
[03:37:30] cracked seems like the problem inside
[03:37:32] has been suppressed he said [ __ ] you I'm
[03:37:35] the archon [ __ ] water bended let me
[03:37:37] guess we're safe for now
[03:37:43] indeed but only for now I win this bet
[03:37:48] you owe me a
[03:37:50] present why' they have a bet very well
[03:37:54] it was indeed just as you said you made
[03:37:57] a
[03:37:58] bet we made a bet on the size of your
[03:38:01] entourage choren thought you size of
[03:38:04] Entourage probably like uh I mean like
[03:38:07] 12 inches well we saw the hyd when he
[03:38:09] charge tax it's like sure it's probably
[03:38:11] about no it's more than 12 it's like
[03:38:13] about 18 I don't know I figured you
[03:38:16] would have at least brought a few people
[03:38:18] along for appearance's sake it appears I
[03:38:21] underestimated just how confidential the
[03:38:23] mission was shouldn't you have gotten
[03:38:25] used to confidential missions by now
[03:38:27] that's just how the courts
[03:38:29] operate so what gift must the loser give
[03:38:35] T he already has tons of tea in his
[03:38:38] office I'm thinking about a set of legal
[03:38:40] codes that wouldn't happen to be a dig
[03:38:43] at my lack of legal awareness would
[03:38:46] it well I'm sure his grace doesn't
[03:38:49] consider the Fortress to be outside the
[03:38:51] law I was under the impression the
[03:38:54] residents of a place like this would be
[03:38:56] uninterested in the legal
[03:38:58] codes that was obviously a
[03:39:02] joke he did not he does not get the joke
[03:39:05] anyway you've still got some unfinished
[03:39:07] business to attend to in the Overworld
[03:39:09] correct no no need to stay here if you
[03:39:11] have a pressing matter we all know you
[03:39:13] can't leave P mormonia for
[03:39:16] long thank you I hope everything went
[03:39:19] smoothly with the foule
[03:39:21] harbinger uhoh yeah about that uh yeah
[03:39:24] so
[03:39:26] finina she's having a tough time but
[03:39:28] she's pretty strong um like meta wise
[03:39:31] I'd recommend Nikita then finina then
[03:39:34] like R and Jong Le uh in terms of just
[03:39:36] like power- wise uh for your account but
[03:39:40] I'm must say we've spent long enough
[03:39:42] Playing
[03:39:44] House
[03:39:47] house what about Kazo I was only talking
[03:39:49] about archons I'm must say we spent a
[03:39:51] lot horse Serena as the hydro archon I
[03:39:55] am sure you understand the exact meaning
[03:39:57] of the phenomenon we just
[03:40:00] witnessed or should I say that's what I
[03:40:03] originally thought but looking at your
[03:40:07] expression was I wrong and you you
[03:40:10] haven't a clue okay listen here arino
[03:40:13] listen okay
[03:40:16] look listen I love you arino I do but
[03:40:20] you can't be bullying finina like that
[03:40:22] because then we'll have a problem okay
[03:40:24] let her be let her be a failure you
[03:40:26] don't have to listen okay why did she
[03:40:31] talk like this what are you trying to
[03:40:33] say she is right though this point I
[03:40:35] don't think there's any more need to
[03:40:37] speak as diplomatic Representatives
[03:40:39] allow ow me to speak to you now as just
[03:40:41] a
[03:40:42] Fontan you know the prophecy by heart
[03:40:45] falling also that every part of it is
[03:40:48] being proven
[03:40:51] true yet here you are relaxing drinking
[03:40:55] tea and eating desserts as if it's all
[03:40:57] nothing more than a few stray
[03:41:00] bugs do you really think that's
[03:41:04] acceptable I mean true but like she's
[03:41:08] cute like you could be nicer to her
[03:41:10] prophecies hanging above our necks like
[03:41:12] a guillotine every faction is looking
[03:41:14] for a way to either avert the disaster
[03:41:17] or save their own even the Orphans of
[03:41:20] the House of the Hearth have devoted
[03:41:22] everything to saving their home guo
[03:41:24] that's actually a France reference but
[03:41:26] you Mar just how nonchalant and carefree

[03:42:21] [ __ ]
[03:42:27] 6'8 I actually did it's actually like it
[03:42:29] literally hurts
[03:42:32] the but from you sorry I got distracted
[03:42:35] it Beggars belief how nonchalant and
[03:42:37] carefree you have been from the very
[03:42:39] beginning you the God falor you have
[03:42:41] utterly failed to take action you're
[03:42:45] wrong I've never ignored the prophecy
[03:42:48] nor have I just been passing the time in
[03:42:51] self-indulgence retract your accusation
[03:42:54] and stop doubting the wisdom of the Gods
[03:42:56] with such absurd
[03:42:59] conjectures I am not alone in my doubts
[03:43:02] you know all the children of Fontaine
[03:43:05] may be harboring the exact same thoughts
[03:43:07] right
[03:43:08] now Harbor I suggest you move dude shut
[03:43:12] the [ __ ] up Z sorry I'll let it play oh
[03:43:15] great Hydro
[03:43:17] archon how are you going to save them
[03:43:20] save us how are the people you've sworn
[03:43:24] to protect supposed to survive in a land
[03:43:26] that will soon disappear beneath the
[03:43:29] waves I have my ways and I've been
[03:43:32] working on them for all this time even
[03:43:36] if you look down upon me you have have
[03:43:40] no right to judge me true Fontaine will
[03:43:43] be saved it will be even even if I still
[03:43:47] cannot see the true future right now as
[03:43:51] long as I continue on as I am I will be
[03:43:55] able to hold my head up high I mean
[03:43:58] that's not really the point they're
[03:44:00] talking about like the prophecy in the
[03:44:01] nation it's not about your
[03:44:03] head
[03:44:04] I so true Queen fre is AC her usual self
[03:44:08] she's actually seriously refuting [ __ ]
[03:44:10] just what have you been wored AED where
[03:44:12] can we see it and what is it doing to
[03:44:16] help oh no yo nlet sent us here to
[03:44:20] protect her why are we silent lumine
[03:44:23] talk is that all a lie or can she really
[03:44:26] not tell us she was so full of
[03:44:27] conviction and confidence just now but
[03:44:28] now she's deflated like a PO balloon
[03:44:30] nevette really said don't let finina
[03:44:32] talk I'm worried about hey the more she
[03:44:34] hey the more she talks the worse it is
[03:44:37] my minations are just like the prophecy
[03:44:41] itself they will only reveal themselves
[03:44:44] at the fated
[03:44:45] time it is just that beings like
[03:44:48] yourselves are unable to perceive them
[03:44:51] as of
[03:44:52] yet I see as a God the proof of your
[03:44:56] labor always lies Beyond prying mortal
[03:45:00] eyes yo allow me to be so bold as to ask
[03:45:03] another one yo someone screenshot that
[03:45:05] for me would it be possible for you to
[03:45:07] tell us the parts of your plan that are
[03:45:08] not confidential
[03:45:10] such as your emergency response plan for
[03:45:13] the impending
[03:45:15] disaster uh an emergency response plan
[03:45:20] no don't say lumine I'm sorry not the
[03:45:23] flame the main character but are you
[03:45:25] [ __ ] stupid just say something say
[03:45:28] something neet a dragon what oh [ __ ] we
[03:45:31] have a defense system say
[03:45:34] something that look in your eyes have
[03:45:37] you not even prepared one of those
[03:45:40] the the emergency response plan is also
[03:45:44] strictly confidential true then allow me
[03:45:47] to jog your memory Miss finina what is
[03:45:50] the purpose of your orrice mechanique
[03:45:52] Deniz Cardinal God not that again what
[03:45:55] do you plan to do with the massive
[03:45:57] amounts of indem nium that has
[03:45:59] accumulated over the
[03:46:01] years the orrice it it's just like it
[03:46:04] appears to
[03:46:06] be H so you also have no idea if I'm not
[03:46:12] mistaken someone's using it to prepare
[03:46:15] for something but unfortunately it would
[03:46:18] seem that someone is not you miss finina
[03:46:22] I first caught wind of this when Linny
[03:46:24] tried to investigate the orri in the
[03:46:26] Opera House you see even just getting
[03:46:29] close to the core contaminated him with
[03:46:32] an extremely large amount of indem nidum
[03:46:35] but even if that had nothing to do with
[03:46:37] you then what could you possibly be
[03:46:41] working on oh great Hydro

[03:46:54] be played if she damages herself or can
[03:46:56] be played uh with finina it could be

[03:47:01] elemental skill uh it could be no not

[03:52:39] returned from The Fortress of meped
[03:52:42] relax I have no intention of trying to
[03:52:44] get anything out of you Linny Lynette
[03:52:47] and fremin are still there and I trust
[03:52:49] their judgment and abilities they've all
[03:52:52] been working very hard and have always
[03:52:54] done all they can to fight back against
[03:52:56] anyone who tried to stop them especially
[03:52:59] you mean
[03:52:59] rley he's a tricky one to deal
[03:53:04] with it's unfortunate that Lenn is so
[03:53:06] eager to prove himself that he can't
[03:53:08] learn to rely on others including me by
[03:53:13] the way and you can just consider this a
[03:53:15] bit of idle gossip but what's your
[03:53:18] impression of finina listen AR you know
[03:53:21] we need to go a bit easier on finina
[03:53:23] okay I get it she's a bit of a failure
[03:53:25] but it's like in a cute way okay she's
[03:53:27] trying her best she's been through a lot
[03:53:30] okay look I get it but like it's like
[03:53:34] look we have to like you have to be a
[03:53:36] little nicer okay just like you know to
[03:53:39] be nice to me but but at least to her
[03:53:42] you are outside of our disputes and the
[03:53:44] freest person in Alla Fontaine able to
[03:53:48] move around most easily allow me to
[03:53:51] share my perspective with
[03:53:54] you and that's everything that happened
[03:53:56] during the trial Master child was
[03:53:58] declared guilty and immediately
[03:54:00] transported to the Fortress of
[03:54:03] meped didn't he say he was coming here
[03:54:05] on vacation does he not feel an ounce of
[03:54:08] Shame for all the trouble he has
[03:54:11] caused I forget it he did give us an
[03:54:16] opportunity yo'll be meeting someone
[03:54:19] short yo what's with yo what's her beef
[03:54:22] with them preparations no need I will
[03:54:25] take care of it myself oh my god I
[03:54:27] didn't even notice she's using the T set
[03:54:28] that I got her for her birthday oh yes
[03:54:31] that's awesome you're welcome arino we
[03:54:34] need to meet with finina a hydro archon
[03:54:37] she is the heart of Fontaine my bad CH
[03:54:40] but what's fascinating about her is that
[03:54:43] she often seems more like a celebrity
[03:54:45] than a working Aron true she's a twitch
[03:54:48] streamer come over oh my [ __ ] is that
[03:55:00] yo how many Primo gems for this outfit
[03:55:03] how many say a number I will say my
[03:55:05] credit card information right
[03:55:07] now
[03:55:09] please give me this
[03:55:11] outfit I will do
[03:55:15] anything
[03:55:24] [Music]
[03:55:32] sorry
[03:55:37] um I was just screenshotting
[03:55:41] again
[03:55:43] morow you dare to run from me stop right
[03:55:47] this instant yo yo it's a cat my goal is
[03:55:50] just to discover the location of the
[03:55:53] nosis but I didn't expect the chance to
[03:55:55] approach finina to be handed to me on a
[03:55:58] silver
[03:55:59] platter this is so easy it's actually
[03:56:01] making me a bit
[03:56:03] suspicious anything left unguarded was
[03:56:05] in the just
[03:56:07] bited but
[03:56:09] wait but also what the [ __ ] is happening
[03:56:10] for taking the bait after all from the
[03:56:14] moment it was attached to the hook the
[03:56:16] bait is meant to be
[03:56:22] sacrificed it's just as I guessed in the
[03:56:24] second before I struck the hydrosis is
[03:56:28] not currently held by the
[03:56:32] archon first of
[03:56:34] all first of all would second of all
[03:56:38] what what the [ __ ] did she try to kill
[03:56:40] her or try to get the [ __ ] yosis in
[03:56:43] fact this archon doesn't seem like a god
[03:56:46] at all yo and I sense that she's under
[03:56:49] some kind of no she's my archon okay who
[03:56:53] are you and what are you trying to do
[03:56:58] please don't kill me I'm begging you
[03:57:02] please the fear in her pupils is genuine
[03:57:06] so perhaps she's not bit after all
[03:57:09] either way targeting her has lost all
[03:57:14] meaning I left the scene with ease
[03:57:17] nobody came looking for me and nobody
[03:57:19] could serve as a witness to my near
[03:57:21] assassination of fosil or I suspect even
[03:57:24] finina dares not mention this incident
[03:57:27] to anyone no tell that my informants
[03:57:30] confirmed what I had guessed after
[03:57:32] returning to her quarters Vina quietly
[03:57:35] cried alone she was so scared that she
[03:57:38] could not sleep that night nor could she
[03:57:40] even bring herself to eat her cake
[03:57:43] there's no doubt that there's something
[03:57:45] wrong with her I began to entertain the
[03:57:48] possibility that she is not the true
[03:57:50] Hydro
[03:57:51] archon perhaps udc's nette is actually
[03:57:55] the genuine article I have to find the
[03:57:59] nosis wait a that's L what I said like 5
[03:58:02] minutes ago but I can't be true is
[03:58:04] probably in possession of it
[03:58:06] alternatively it might have been hidden
[03:58:08] in a place that's hard for ordinary
[03:58:10] people to access did you see the cut
[03:58:12] scene did you see the cut
[03:58:14] whoa my dear children where they come
[03:58:16] from please
[03:58:18] speak did she see the cut scene that we
[03:58:20] just saw Master cuz that was my reaction
[03:58:23] like child has gone missing on top of
[03:58:25] that the contacts and guards we bried at
[03:58:27] The Fortress have all gone quiet as
[03:58:30] well probably the handiwork of that ride
[03:58:34] slee I'm afraid
[03:58:37] so this is a good opportunity the value
[03:58:41] of a Harbinger is much higher than most
[03:58:43] would imagine we now have an excuse to
[03:58:46] exert diplomatic pressure on the
[03:58:48] Fontaine
[03:58:51] authorities set up a meeting for me I
[03:58:54] would like to meet the hydro archon and
[03:58:57] udex
[03:58:59] net oh and I have an additional mission
[03:59:03] for you
[03:59:04] three yes Father Bring Me The Traveler
[03:59:07] tarag is disappear was not a part of my
[03:59:10] plan but I can use it to make a
[03:59:12] breakthrough with this as my excuse I
[03:59:15] can ask for an official audience and
[03:59:18] continue my investigation of finina and
[03:59:20] udex net the initiative belongs to the
[03:59:24] house of the Hearth my wish to
[03:59:26] investigate the Fortress of mpede will
[03:59:28] be a front Linny and his group will be
[03:59:31] responsible for the actual intelligence
[03:59:35] gathering damn what the [ __ ] just
[03:59:38] happened
[03:59:42] the [ __ ] just happened
[03:59:44] dude D nobody really cared what happened
[03:59:46] the child Lenny's group is quite close
[03:59:49] to you so they wouldn't have hidden
[03:59:51] anything from
[03:59:53] you you attacked the hydro the [ __ ] is
[03:59:56] she here it wouldn't mean anything even
[03:59:59] if you shouted it from the rooftops
[04:00:01] after all even finina herself is still
[04:00:04] pretending that nothing of that sort
[04:00:06] ever happened uh
[04:00:09] all right
[04:00:10] then poor two chances to enjoy tea with
[04:00:14] finina I have to say the leadership of
[04:00:17] Fontaine is even more inscrutable than I
[04:00:19] had imagined I once surmised that udex
[04:00:22] net must be the hydro archon but now
[04:00:26] that doesn't seem right to me either the
[04:00:28] hydro archon's dead how'd you come to
[04:00:30] that conclusion I am a servant of her
[04:00:32] majesty the tarita over my years of
[04:00:35] service I've learned how a real archon
[04:00:38] conducts and Carries themselves whether
[04:00:41] udex net or finina neither fits the bill
[04:00:45] it's hard to imagine either of them as
[04:00:47] the archon of course that is all just
[04:00:50] how I feel oh Ki it's
[04:00:54] k no wonder I've been saying she's the
[04:00:58] that after all my years working in
[04:01:00] intelligence gathering I've come to
[04:01:03] realize I am at a complete loss
[04:01:05] regarding the identity of the god of the
[04:01:07] land of my birth
[04:01:09] don't you think Fontaine is quite
[04:01:11] intriguing a catastrophe looms yet many
[04:01:14] Secrets have yet to rise to the
[04:01:18] surface it looks like fontans will have
[04:01:21] no choice but to save themselves
[04:01:23] ultimately though one must survive in
[04:01:26] order to do anything else should the
[04:01:29] need arise I would be happy to cooperate
[04:01:33] with you you don't need to commit to
[04:01:35] anything right now of course I have a
[04:01:38] feeling that the situation will continue
[04:01:40] to evolve and as your name is often
[04:01:43] connected with Noble Deeds I'm sure we
[04:01:46] will work together someday I'm sure to
[04:01:50] never let he certainly returned quickly
[04:01:54] you must want to catch up with each
[04:01:55] other so I'll leave you to
[04:02:01] him uhoh I'm sorry father is it over for
[04:02:07] now yes but this issue will prove quite
[04:02:09] thorny in the long term I'm concerned
[04:02:12] that sooner or later the prophesized
[04:02:14] events will occur thank you for
[04:02:17] protecting finina yo we didn't do [ __ ]
[04:02:19] I'm going be honest we actually we did
[04:02:21] more harm than good I can't lie we were
[04:02:23] [ __ ] useless I used my power to force
[04:02:25] back the primordial Sea and reeal the
[04:02:27] SLO gate and for
[04:02:32] us H so as expected the Nave has turned
[04:02:37] up the pressure on fena she's trying to
[04:02:40] feel her out though I'm still unsure as
[04:02:43] to her
[04:02:44] motives okay do not use my zyo happy
[04:02:46] emote and then type nous after that is
[04:02:49] not the proper use of my emote and quite
[04:02:51] frankly it is tainting it can I ask you
[04:02:53] some questions per
[04:02:54] granted you have enough power to force
[04:02:56] back the Primal SE does this mean you
[04:02:58] have enough power to throw it back wa it
[04:03:02] can't be that you're the real Hydro
[04:03:04] archine right but that's just a
[04:03:07] speculation on our part
[04:03:09] though you can't tell us then then
[04:03:14] that's okay we can talk about something
[04:03:17] else we won't try to force you but
[04:03:20] that's just a theory strange if by the
[04:03:24] phrase you guys you are referring to
[04:03:26] finina and I then although I'm not sure
[04:03:29] just what you are trying to imply I must
[04:03:31] clarify that I do not share her
[04:03:34] positions on a multitude of topics what
[04:03:36] did he say to the Fortress of mared did
[04:03:38] you manage to protect those that needed
[04:03:39] to be defended I believe so the Fortress
[04:03:42] has a long and complex history it has
[04:03:44] seen much grief and
[04:03:48] suffering and now another catastrophe
[04:03:51] will soon be upon us I mour this it's
[04:03:55] about to start [ __ ] raining watch huh
[04:03:57] why is it raining all of a sudden I knew
[04:04:04] [Music]
[04:04:06] it it saids that a dragon of water once
[04:04:09] resided F bro are you does the [ __ ]
[04:04:12] do lumine and Pon think we're [ __ ]
[04:04:14] stupid bro frem literally said in like
[04:04:17] the first cut scene that when the dragon
[04:04:19] cries it rains and then nevet cried and
[04:04:22] it was like a clear assumption in like
[04:04:24] 4.0 and people pretended they didn't
[04:04:26] know who the [ __ ] Dragon was bro it's
[04:04:28] been like four patches you may be closer
[04:04:30] to the truth than you think oh and what
[04:04:33] are you thinking he's the dragon
[04:04:35] Sovereign of
[04:04:36] water the dragon
[04:04:41] of what yeah you know how Jong is a
[04:04:43] dragon but like Gio okay but you know
[04:04:46] APAP
[04:04:48] right have you heard of
[04:04:51] Dallin
[04:04:58] finina Vette are you
[04:05:01] listening my
[04:05:04] apologies we were just guessing randomly
[04:05:07] we didn't guess right did we you're not
[04:05:09] actually the dragon Sovereign of water
[04:05:12] right well if you don't want to confirm
[04:05:14] her we have the Jong isn't a dragon or
[04:05:16] in my chat correctly I sincerely hope
[04:05:19] you it's actually just one of his forms
[04:05:21] it's not technically a sovereign Dragon
[04:05:23] it's just a form you and ala didn't
[04:05:25] recognize him so actually if you read
[04:05:28] there's still something P wants to ask
[04:05:30] you though please go
[04:05:33] ahead well if you are the true I don't
[04:05:36] care you were able to force back he has
[04:05:39] a dragon form so that's all then since
[04:05:42] K's prophecy is all about seawater
[04:05:45] couldn't you just use your power to
[04:05:47] solve the
[04:05:48] crisis none of the currently living
[04:05:50] dragon sovereigns in the world myself
[04:05:53] included possess our full Dragon Hood
[04:05:57] they say that when the first usurper
[04:05:58] arrived on usurper They seized a part of
[04:06:01] the dragon's power today that stolen
[04:06:05] power is the basis of the archon's
[04:06:07] authority
[04:06:08] there are seven Elemental archons and
[04:06:11] seven matching Dragon sovereigns the
[04:06:14] dragon Sovereign of water who lived
[04:06:16] through that era perished a long time
[04:06:18] ago as their successor I know far less
[04:06:21] about our ancient history in any case I
[04:06:26] will not be able to do much know I this
[04:06:28] Aron disappears returns their Elemental
[04:06:30] Authority to me given the status quo
[04:06:33] however I would recommend finding
[04:06:35] another way to deal with the prophecy
[04:06:38] oh so even you can't solve it I still
[04:06:41] have some urgent matters to attend to at
[04:06:43] my office if you have any more questions

[04:16:43] doing things and she'll do everything in
[04:16:45] her power to help those she considers

[04:17:24] with us or do I do it another day cuz
[04:17:27] I'm down to do it but I could also
[04:17:29] wait no why is every not saying
[04:17:33] no not speedrun like I wouldn't skip
[04:17:35] anything obviously but I'm saying do
[04:17:37] have time to finish
[04:17:41] it The Wind
[04:17:51] Rises the best act I know it is but I'd
[04:17:54] feel bad if I
[04:17:58] like take a break while playing it okay
[04:18:01] let me ask a followup question is there
[04:18:03] a point within Act five where I could
[04:18:04] pause and do something else like is
[04:18:06] there a point before it gets too hype or
[04:18:08] I could
[04:18:10] like or is it just the whole thing is
[04:18:12] like is
[04:18:16] POG too
[04:18:23] slow the whole thing is POG finish act
[04:18:27] four I did didn't I oh my God
[04:18:35] I
[04:18:38] boring [ __ ] I'm actually the worst
[04:18:50] Navigator L is still in act four who's

[04:18:59] me or did I just see two inmates come

[04:19:04] strange winds blowing of late
[04:19:07] we wanted to see how the Fortress is
[04:19:08] doing is everything still all right
[04:19:11] we're fine for the most part net came
[04:19:14] down and took care of the worst of it if
[04:19:16] that's just ask him to stay here oh yeah
[04:19:20] what a brilliant plan let's go convince
[04:19:22] the udex himself to exchange the quarts
[04:19:24] of Fontaine for a puddle of water why is
[04:19:27] this guy so
[04:19:28] sassy okay I'm sorry he came here I

[04:19:48] milkshake choren received lipstick
[04:19:52] instead those aren't even remotely alike
[04:19:55] well it's Net's own fault for making
[04:19:57] Sween worried about his health by
[04:19:59] working so much but besides that our

[04:27:00] we do it tomorrow or whatever I'm going

[04:27:08] like very short

[04:27:13] dad is awake so I'm going to wear
[04:27:29] this are you cold yes it is the middle
[04:27:33] of December in
[04:27:34] Canada

[04:28:00] chat
[04:28:04] yo
[04:28:10] all right let me be I'll let you guys
[04:28:12] know what we're doing in like I need to
[04:28:14] make coffee so it'll take like 1 minute

[04:28:45] [Music]
[04:29:13] [Music]
[04:30:05] [Music]
[04:31:00] [Music]
[04:31:29] [Music]
[04:31:39] [Music]
[04:31:46] [Music]
[04:33:20] sh I'm muted Chad I did not stall there
[04:33:22] was no
[04:33:24] stalling I got more food
[04:33:26] though cuz I'm
[04:33:34] hungry
[04:33:45] all right I'm back to
[04:33:46] Jean okay chat listen chat
[04:33:50] listen chat
[04:33:58] listen I don't know what the play is cuz
[04:34:01] Okay on one hand I think we can do it I
[04:34:04] do but on the other
[04:34:08] hand we could if I have to interrupt
[04:34:10] near the end I will be tilted now I've
[04:34:12] seen some people do it in four and a
[04:34:14] half hours while by seene I mean looking
[04:34:16] at the
[04:34:18] vaud but also if it's a banger I could
[04:34:23] upload the VA of me doing on the second
[04:34:25] Channel
[04:34:27] however I don't know if people would
[04:34:28] want to watch
[04:34:34] that the good parts aren't at the end
[04:34:36] you'll be
[04:34:45] fine I
[04:34:47] would the thing is it's like the Argo
[04:34:50] has been out for like over a
[04:35:04] month
[04:35:25] do a poll yeah but I don't trust the
[04:35:32] majority doesn't take 5 hours
[04:35:36] you are wasting
[04:35:38] time okay I'll do a
[04:35:54] poll keep in mind the HSR lives in 5
[04:35:57] hours well
[04:35:58] 440
[04:36:04] 450
[04:36:08] the only downside of doing it now is
[04:36:10] that there's a chance we do four hours
[04:36:12] of it then we pause for an hour and then
[04:36:13] we go back to
[04:36:15] it that is the only downside potentially
[04:36:18] which I wouldn't want to have to
[04:36:23] do that's
[04:36:28] fine skip I am not skipping
[04:36:34] HSR
[04:37:00] watch the one on YouTube it's usually a
[04:37:02] bit later yeah but like I have to see a
[04:37:04] live
[04:37:13] he can't skip no I can like it's my
[04:37:15] decision I could skip it it doesn't
[04:37:17] matter but like I don't want to like I
[04:37:19] want to watch it we're supposed to leave
[04:37:21] the Fortress of mpede come on we've
[04:37:34] got
[04:37:48] skip Pon she just
