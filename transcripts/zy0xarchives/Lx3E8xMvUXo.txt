[00:31:05] a oh wait I saw a
[00:31:09] clip uh it's probably in my likes but
[00:31:11] likes are private so uh
[00:31:16] yeah one second
[00:31:35] when in
[00:31:43] uh engin impact dude honestly so after
[00:31:47] my daughter's bath last night I was
[00:31:48] putting over cam in uh Kate's office and
[00:31:52] Kate I think she was playing honkai Star
[00:31:54] rail I'm not going to play it but after
[00:31:57] watch watching her play it I was kind of
[00:31:59] like I think I get it it's like slay the
[00:32:03] Spire but instead of like you know in
[00:32:05] slay the Spire you do an attack and the
[00:32:07] attack goes like like you get like a
[00:32:09] little red line on the screen and then a
[00:32:11] number appears she was doing like an
[00:32:13] attack and a dude was like put like a
[00:32:16] Deon into a slot machine that came down
[00:32:19] from the sky and it rolled like 14 gold
[00:32:23] bars and then gold bars poured out of
[00:32:25] the machine and was like hitting angels
[00:32:27] and it was like
[00:32:30] 9999999999999 and I was like bro I get
[00:32:32] it man and then like so that's the
[00:32:34] Gambler and then there's like another
[00:32:36] character that's like a nerd and he she
[00:32:38] kept doing like Kito ero Su Kito ER goam
[00:32:41] and it was like a like a facts and logic
[00:32:44] and people were getting blown the [ __ ]
[00:32:45] out by facts and logic and I was like
[00:32:47] bro I think I get it
[00:32:49] man that's a character named Dr
[00:32:53] ratio dude she's playing a full up
[00:32:55] attack team though that's kind of B it
[00:32:56] seems like it whatever she was playing
[00:32:58] she's doing like it's slay the Spire but
[00:33:00] like marveled up I I totally get it and
[00:33:04] then like I had to go get some lotion
[00:33:05] from the other room and when I came back
[00:33:07] in she was playing as like a little guy
[00:33:10] in a in a room full of big robots and
[00:33:12] she was running around like that's H and
[00:33:15] then she pick up like a little rocket
[00:33:16] and stuff it in the rocket launcher and
[00:33:17] go like and then like there'd be a
[00:33:20] treasure chest and then the treasure
[00:33:21] chest would be like here's 17 secular
[00:33:24] Jade and then she' get to the big
[00:33:26] treasure chest and it was like boom
[00:33:29] boom and I was like what the [ __ ] is

[00:36:23] song I forget what the orchestra's
[00:36:25] called
[00:36:30] I got
[00:36:32] it how do I pause
[00:36:35] [Music]
[00:36:41] my I
[00:36:43] tweeted again he who tweets I
[00:36:47] tweeted no disrespect but I really think
[00:36:50] cedin should have been a
[00:36:52] fourstar and to be fair right
[00:36:57] like look at this [ __ ] man look at this
[00:37:00] [ __ ] man there's three Hydro four stars
[00:37:02] one of them is Barbara the other one
[00:37:04] Candace look you're pretty and good at
[00:37:06] C6 but before C6 kind of hard to make
[00:37:09] you work and then sr's [ __ ] broken
[00:37:11] okay so and in Hydro main character
[00:37:13] doesn't even
[00:37:15] exist so I'm like hey no disrespect but
[00:37:19] given the socioeconomic climate of the
[00:37:22] world I would like to let me let me trim
[00:37:24] this out I would like to uh you know
[00:37:27] maybe get another fourstar Hydro okay
[00:37:31] nothing wrong with that I think we can
[00:37:32] all agree we would like a four-star
[00:37:33] Hydro except the one guy who was like 1
[00:37:37] second this was a stunlock let me see if
[00:37:39] I can find
[00:37:41] it
[00:37:46] uh except the one guy who was like every
[00:37:50] this was this I said nice try you won't
[00:37:53] sunlock me but I'm going to get stocked
[00:37:54] every fourstar is shitty if they are
[00:37:56] below C6 and it's way more expensive to
[00:37:58] get a four-star to C6 than a festar LOL
[00:38:00] and also even if you get them to C6
[00:38:03] they're probably getting power C by a
[00:38:04] five star that's is stronger than C6
[00:38:06] four stars are a scam in this game and
[00:38:07] then they said also I don't even play
[00:38:10] this thing anymore go do something
[00:38:14] better so just rep with to anyways let's
[00:38:17] get back on
[00:38:18] track look everyone would like another
[00:38:21] four-star Hydro no one's against this
[00:38:23] okay I was just saying look sein feels
[00:38:26] like uh we kakomi now look look that's
[00:38:29] not to say you can't get her that's not
[00:38:30] to say if you if you don't like her
[00:38:32] don't get I'm making a guide It's
[00:38:33] overall a positive video because it's
[00:38:35] like hey if you like the character
[00:38:36] here's how you play her okay but I don't
[00:38:38] recommend going for her but if you want
[00:38:40] her that's cool I just think she should
[00:38:42] be a fourstar that that's that that's
[00:38:43] not even a bad take it's not even like a
[00:38:46] controversial take but then the [ __ ]
[00:38:47] oh sein lover 552 [ __ ] Drake dror
[00:38:50] disrespect in my [ __ ] quote tweets
[00:38:52] like oh actually I'm glad she's a five
[00:38:55] star you don't deserve happiness [ __ ]
[00:38:57] [ __ ] you dude like what are you doing
[00:38:59] man okay I'm sorry you want to gatekeep
[00:39:02] your favorite character but that doesn't
[00:39:03] mean that a mid-unit has to be a five
[00:39:05] star I'm sorry I said mid that was
[00:39:07] generous they're terrible but listen
[00:39:09] Okay people thought Ki was bad at the
[00:39:11] start but now we actually know how the
[00:39:13] game works and guess what I I guarantee
[00:39:16] you unless Natan releases a mechanic
[00:39:17] that's like oh roll a dice if you hit a
[00:39:20] six and have sein in your team one shot
[00:39:23] the enemy she's probably not going to
[00:39:25] get much better now don't get me wrong
[00:39:26] she can be played in some teams monoh
[00:39:28] Hydro uh
[00:39:30] freeze other stuff but does that make
[00:39:33] her the best option no is she usable
[00:39:35] yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely
[00:39:37] you can use her you can use her pull for
[00:39:40] who you
[00:39:42] like I don't know why I just said all of
[00:39:44] that but the music was kind of amping me
[00:39:46] up I'm sorry I don't even feel that
[00:39:47] strongly about her I think she's she's
[00:39:49] all right like she's not all right she's
[00:39:50] pretty bad but like you know it's okay
[00:39:52] not you know if you like her and want to
[00:39:54] heal her she's comfy and some characters
[00:39:57] can be comfy and that's
[00:40:03] cool anyways we have two sponsored
[00:40:05] segments today so hopefully they don't
[00:40:06] watch this part of the stream uh no
[00:40:08] disrespect look I'm a I'm a nice I'm a
[00:40:10] nice person uh I review characters
[00:40:12] honestly right I don't slander charact
[00:40:14] I'm an honest man okay I'm I'm honest
[00:40:15] okay I give honest reviews of characters
[00:40:17] most it's usually positive because most
[00:40:19] characters are good C is not ideal okay
[00:40:22] but but she's not like useless she's
[00:40:24] just not ideal and I wouldn't recommend
[00:40:26] going for her but if you like her her
[00:40:28] you know go ahead go ahead now with that
[00:40:31] in
[00:40:32] mind
[00:40:34] um
[00:40:38] unfortunately so rli's voice actor Joe
[00:40:42] who did a great job at voicing rizzly I
[00:40:44] think rizzly is a very well voiced
[00:40:49] character quote tweeted me he said This
[00:40:51] is war upon seeing my no disrespect but
[00:40:54] I think seedin should have been a four
[00:40:55] star
[00:41:00] okay first of all caught but second of
[00:41:02] all this is a misunderstanding I never
[00:41:04] even said she was bad like okay I just
[00:41:06] did on the live stream hey okay but in
[00:41:08] my tweet I didn't say she was bad
[00:41:12] okay oh I misspelled rizzly whatever uh
[00:41:15] but but look I so I clarified I believe
[00:41:18] you have a simple misunderstanding here
[00:41:19] rizzly okay I misspelled it firstly let
[00:41:21] me clarify that I'm a big fan of yours
[00:41:23] true I love rizley okay he's uh you know
[00:41:27] probably the he probably has the biggest
[00:41:29] like arms that we have in gen that does
[00:41:31] that's not saying much okay I get it I
[00:41:33] get it he's still you know but but but
[00:41:36] you know I respect him I respect his
[00:41:39] work firstly let me clarify that I'm a
[00:41:41] big fan of yours in this post I'm simply
[00:41:43] advocating for sedn to be able to help
[00:41:45] more people by uh being more accessible
[00:41:47] as a fourstar and then I would have
[00:41:49] added but I don't have Twitter blue so I
[00:41:50] can't type more she's a nurse she wants
[00:41:52] to help people right it would make her
[00:41:54] happy to be accessible to more players
[00:41:57] okay if she was standard or a fourstar
[00:42:00] hydro more people would have her she
[00:42:02] would be seen as a better unit because
[00:42:04] as a five star people like you know
[00:42:06] yolan uh kakomi uh nevet uh
[00:42:10] Kaza Kaza counts as a hydro anyways and
[00:42:13] I wrote I believe this will make her
[00:42:14] happy and it ended there okay uh
[00:42:18] although to be fair I noticed he he
[00:42:22] replied uh he replied to like a reply
[00:42:26] wait where was it
[00:42:28] dude everyone's just typing
[00:42:31] caught show probable spam wait is this
[00:42:34] like

[00:42:51] realistic for average it's not
[00:42:55] this I'm the biggest Shia [ __ ] dick
[00:42:58] rider in the world and I don't expect
[00:42:59] the average player to have C6 fars on
[00:43:01] what are you talking
[00:43:04] about I don't know I can't find
[00:43:07] it

[00:43:29] kind of mid so like using a bad
[00:43:32] character with a mid character won't
[00:43:33] make for like the best team but it's
[00:43:35] like no offense to a year of prime
[00:43:38] wasted that was AI that was manipulated
[00:43:41] that was out of
[00:43:45] context that was not

[00:44:49] but um I I think that's
[00:44:53] mostly it

[00:46:10] other monitor it wouldn't have lagged
[00:46:11] but for some reason it lagged because
[00:46:13] they were double
[00:46:15] stacked well we can watch it later I
[00:46:17] have it open I didn't watch the video
[00:46:18] but like yeah well I ski like I skipped
[00:46:20] through it I saw that like my part was
[00:46:27] hey this is what happens when you don't
[00:46:28] give a structure in or order way okay
[00:46:31] well Nick I hear you Nick I heard you
[00:46:34] sec I heard you benched all of sa's

[00:47:16] ask for zag to send me that reply man he
[00:47:19] sent me that reply I I I was like what
[00:47:21] the [ __ ] do I do to this do I double
[00:47:22] down or do I ignore it
[00:47:26] [Music]
[00:47:28] uh at my high school
[00:47:30] graduation he just scroll past my post
[00:47:37] [Music]
[00:47:40] what gu it
[00:47:48] [Laughter]
[00:47:53] wasn't I'm sorry I don't even know why
[00:47:56] that was funny
[00:47:59] okay we're in this
[00:48:01] we s
[00:48:04] bad oh my God yes no oh my God I
[00:48:10] missed minut
[00:48:13] guys reminescence how do I get there my
[00:48:16] co hurts professor professor oh my God I
[00:48:19] got it get
[00:48:22] there what the [ __ ] am I looking at this
[00:48:26] was on r/ what the [ __ ] is genin MCT I
[00:48:30] don't want to click on
[00:48:32] it he's actually kind of right we have
[00:48:34] too many Hydro five
[00:48:35] stars
[00:48:43] true I got cedin I agree should be a for
[00:48:46] that because no same person would give
[00:48:47] up would just give up finina and pull
[00:48:49] for cedin you want Hydro application
[00:48:50] healing for Nick can do both well okay I
[00:48:53] know finina can heal but like finina
[00:48:54] kind of can't heal like whenever someone
[00:48:56] says finina can heal I just disregard
[00:48:57] their opinion like no I know I know like
[00:48:59] no disrespect I know you're agreeing
[00:49:00] with me but like just cuz like you're
[00:49:02] not going healing stats you get no
[00:49:04] particles you do no Dam like C6 yeah and
[00:49:06] like for exploration cool wait
[00:49:11] actually C's entire thing is being cool
[00:49:13] for like
[00:49:16] exploration but if if if that's the
[00:49:19] argument then you could also just like
[00:49:21] use Fin's healing for exploration but
[00:49:24] anyways um
[00:49:27] I believe in CED they've released
[00:49:28] characters with bad kids in the past
[00:49:30] that got later buffed to the new region
[00:49:32] okay I'm going to be
[00:49:34] honest I'm trying to be very very
[00:49:37] generous because like I believe in some
[00:49:40] of
[00:49:43] their like in their in their you know
[00:49:46] character
[00:49:48] kits like dea is in my opinion bad uh
[00:49:52] well okay she's bad but in my opinion
[00:49:55] she should like her kid should be fixed
[00:49:57] because a lot of it doesn't make sense
[00:49:59] however she did get better with so like
[00:50:01] she synergizes with like nlet kind of uh
[00:50:04] liny and like some other team I'm
[00:50:07] forgetting
[00:50:09] whatever you two meta brained
[00:50:11] underestimate how much healing on skill
[00:50:12] is to Casual players I mean yeah I like
[00:50:15] it's nice and that's what I say in my
[00:50:17] guide that's not out yet but like on my
[00:50:20] stream I'm very honest about how I feel
[00:50:21] and like dude I don't give a [ __ ] like
[00:50:23] it's just like it's so whatever like for
[00:50:27] a limited five star it's like I don't
[00:50:29] know man just
[00:50:39] like I mean I guess that's fair I I I
[00:50:41] honestly I'm going to say okay this this
[00:50:44] is going to
[00:50:45] sound actually no this is probably a
[00:50:47] mainstream take but like I feel like if
[00:50:49] cin was just a cat list I'd be fine with
[00:50:53] her cuz like being a bow is so okay I gu
[00:50:56] guess okay there you go I found the
[00:50:58] loophole Natan they give us okay [ __ ]
[00:51:00] quote me on this when cedin becomes meta
[00:51:02] in like 5.24 when they release a
[00:51:05] thrilling Tales bow that is the only
[00:51:08] case if they release a thrilling Tales
[00:51:10] bow and then bow becomes better than C
[00:51:12] but Callis also on field you apply Hydro
[00:51:15] okay a bow where your normal attacks are
[00:51:17] Hydro they Infuse your normal attacks
[00:51:19] with your element and you get thrilling
[00:51:21] Tails then she would be better
[00:51:33] oh wait this Comon is
[00:51:36] hiddenus
[00:51:39] 96 anyways let me get off Reddit uh
[00:51:42] we're going to pull for
[00:51:50] Firefly um
[00:51:59] like like I think that like SE sein's
[00:52:01] just a comfy character in my opinion and
[00:52:03] I do think she could be
[00:52:05] better in the future I think her C2 is
[00:52:08] good I think she's comfy but I don't
[00:52:11] think she's like I think she should be a
[00:52:13] four star which like I feel like if you
[00:52:15] like the
[00:52:17] character the only argument for her
[00:52:19] being a five star that's good for you is
[00:52:20] if you pull for constellations cuz
[00:52:21] they're probably going to be better or
[00:52:23] if you're like a gatekeeper like h no
[00:52:25] one likes kokomi but I did so she's a
[00:52:27] five star well like koki is good
[00:52:32] but like the reason people thought
[00:52:34] kokomi was bad like okay people like to
[00:52:37] do this backpedaling where it's like
[00:52:39] kokomi was bad at release but dendro
[00:52:41] made her better and like I see people
[00:52:42] still defending that take and like sure
[00:52:44] she got better but clam didn't even make
[00:52:47] her that much better than just running a
[00:52:48] normal DPS set on field like it wasn't
[00:52:50] like that much better for onfield it was
[00:52:52] better but wasn't like that much better
[00:52:53] denro made her better okay but she was
[00:52:55] still good in
[00:52:56] one of the most meta teams at the time
[00:52:58] actually the best slot in arguably the
[00:53:00] most meta team at the time which was
[00:53:02] freeze and was good for like other
[00:53:05] generic [ __ ] it's just people the reason
[00:53:07] why we thought she was worse than she
[00:53:09] was was because she was kind of marketed
[00:53:12] or her constellations made her feel like
[00:53:13] a DPS and then [ __ ] got C6
[00:53:16] played her on field and she felt worse
[00:53:18] than
[00:53:18] like [ __ ] Shang
[00:53:23] Ling but like as a Healer she was always
[00:53:25] like as a support was always
[00:53:27] good it's just it was freeze meta and
[00:53:30] then it became Dome meta so it went from
[00:53:32] like kakomi being good in whatever the
[00:53:34] old [ __ ] was to kakomi being good and
[00:53:36] whatever the new [ __ ]
[00:53:37] is but
[00:53:40] anyways it's also like an argument I
[00:53:43] made at the time was like okay she gives
[00:53:45] you thrilling Tails healing Hydro app
[00:53:47] and MTH which makes her by default
[00:53:51] useful but you have Barbara like that
[00:53:54] was like the thing but the thing is is
[00:53:56] like even even though Barbara can do a
[00:53:57] lot similarly the quality of life
[00:54:00] upgrade is huge you also don't have MTH
[00:54:02] without Barbara but like Barbara's okay
[00:54:05] but like the quality of life going from
[00:54:06] like Barbara's self- freezing dog [ __ ]
[00:54:09] uh e to ki's jellyfish is like huge and
[00:54:13] Ki can onfield a lot
[00:54:18] better she still sucks that's bait nice
[00:54:21] try though nice try buddy
[00:54:29] K also freezes with e okay but like Ki
[00:54:32] yeah Ki can Q for up time or run
[00:54:37] sack I guess you don't want to run sack
[00:54:39] well you run sack in Neu
[00:54:42] but
[00:54:46] anyways cin C2 seems mid to me it's it
[00:54:50] makes her go from like I don't want her
[00:54:53] in my team to like I can use her in my
[00:54:54] team true
[00:54:57] okay let's
[00:54:58] pull we are now entering star rail
[00:55:02] Zone oh wait I wanted to gear before I
[00:55:04] pulled
[00:55:06] [ __ ] whatever I'll pull first okay we
[00:55:09] can run a gambo if you guys
[00:55:14] want like it's not even that seon's that
[00:55:16] bad it's like there's so many other good
[00:55:19] hydros and good healers like you can do
[00:55:21] Shan Yun or baiju who are [ __ ] like
[00:55:23] arguably I don't want to say broken but
[00:55:25] like really good
[00:55:27] you can even run kie with like Nikita
[00:55:28] Amber like prototype Amber so it's like
[00:55:33] she also doesn't apply Hydro like are
[00:55:35] you avoiding playing Elden ring DLC
[00:55:38] because you have ancient beefed with
[00:55:40] hedgehogs but the thing is like okay
[00:55:42] after I ended stream yesterday I started
[00:55:43] doing some mono Hydro clears and it was
[00:55:46] genuinely like enjoyable like it was fun
[00:55:48] I cleared well but like was seedin the
[00:55:52] reason I was clearing well or was it
[00:55:54] finina yolan kazua
[00:56:00] you would not believe your eyes if 10
[00:56:02] million fire lit up also I didn't use
[00:56:05] any like I just used live server like
[00:56:07] this was all recorded on my main so I
[00:56:08] can show the
[00:56:10] clips like
[00:56:12] look okay I just took two damage like
[00:56:16] her bubble is cool and she Buffs my
[00:56:18] Fin's damage but like I feel like most
[00:56:20] of this clear is just
[00:56:24] got the bird
[00:56:28] win I mean she is a Healer though so
[00:56:31] what do I expect her to
[00:56:33] do
[00:56:37] Qui for this floor in particular though
[00:56:39] kakomi would just be
[00:56:40] better
[00:56:42] but I mean you could argue not
[00:56:44] significantly better
[00:56:46] cuz well you want the Hydra up time to
[00:56:52] shine here comes the catch
[00:57:09] okay my rotation was cooked here oh I
[00:57:13] retried I was like I have too many cool
[00:57:15] Downs this is tilting and I reset oops
[00:57:19] time to
[00:57:21] go trying Sorry Sorry probably
[00:57:26] I [ __ ] up my rotation man I thought my
[00:57:28] cool Downs were up Let the
[00:57:32] world I didn't get stream as I was
[00:57:35] watching vhi welcome back here comes
[00:57:45] the but
[00:57:46] like I don't know I I don't even I don't
[00:57:49] think she's like that
[00:57:51] bad if you like don't have internet
[00:57:53] access and don't have other characters
[00:57:55] just cuz like
[00:57:58] like being able to heal on your skill
[00:58:02] for a finina team and buffing your
[00:58:05] finina skill damage makes her a usable
[00:58:08] character like it's never going to be
[00:58:09] like unusable it's just there's usually
[00:58:11] better options I'm just trying to be
[00:58:13] like very transparent because like it's
[00:58:16] not like you can't use her if you like
[00:58:18] her like you can and there's a chance
[00:58:19] she gets better but like also I saw some
[00:58:22] arguments like okay what if she gets
[00:58:24] better if like every character on your
[00:58:25] skill does uh in your team does skill
[00:58:27] damage from off field well okay but you
[00:58:29] can only get 10 procs on it so like you
[00:58:31] only need one damage dealer that does
[00:58:33] skilled like you don't if you're running
[00:58:35] finina ficial they're sharing it they're
[00:58:36] not both getting buffed which is stupid
[00:58:39] unless I'm misunderstanding her kit
[00:58:40] anyways okay this is entering star rail
[00:58:44] Zone okay okay star rail I'm sorry I'm
[00:58:49] sorry let me time St this 5852

[01:02:18] to build

[01:02:21] so I don't actually know what the [ __ ]
[01:02:23] her abilities do I just know she's

[01:04:04] might as well activate all of these on
[01:04:06] stream cuz it'll be funnier it'll be
[01:04:08] funnier that way also I have like six
[01:04:10] Tracks Of Destiny but it's okay Savor
[01:04:13] the shared journey I literally did every
[01:04:16] event recently though it's not even like
[01:04:17] I I like oh you don't have events it's
[01:04:19] literally just like I literally level
[01:04:22] like every character in Oblivion
[01:04:27] dude I did the [ __ ] event where clock
[01:04:29] is like recreating a [ __ ] film that
[01:04:33] sucked

[01:05:50] it at
[01:05:53] 80 okay wait before I level this
[01:05:56] yeah I don't know why I leveled
[01:05:58] skill let me Max my
[01:06:02] Firefly also I yeah okay you're right I
[01:06:06] probably should give uh Ron May a
[01:06:09] different set I I give her I don't give
[01:06:10] her an energy set cuz I run her with wo
[01:06:12] usually in my [ __ ] what team do I
[01:06:14] play her in I think I play Ron May wo
[01:06:17] Kafka Black Swan usually but now I'm
[01:06:20] playing her in break teams so I
[01:06:23] probably should swap my set to like
[01:06:25] vonck or
[01:06:29] something but even in a break team it
[01:06:31] doesn't make sense to have a crit damage
[01:06:32] set so I don't know why she's on that
[01:06:34] whatever don't talk to me I maybe it's
[01:06:36] the blade Jing the I don't know man
[01:06:38] Don't Talk To
[01:06:44] Me Subs dos should I 80 her I'll 0 her
[01:06:49] maybe I can finally have my own dreams
[01:07:14] Journeys Never
[01:07:18] End okay uh almost done the only problem
[01:07:23] here is I don't have that many
[01:07:24] destruction lones so my inor Lune is now
[01:07:28] naked but that's

[01:08:18] enough uh I have to read her kit I know
[01:08:22] you level all
[01:08:24] talent and
[01:08:27] skill but I have to read her
[01:08:29] kit I know alt is important
[01:08:42] [Music]
[01:08:43] though I know Talent priority for her
[01:08:46] like I know how to build her I just
[01:08:47] haven't read
[01:08:53] anything I need to craft sh [ __ ]
[01:09:10] though like I know what she does I just
[01:09:13] don't know like how she does
[01:09:15] it like like I know what her kid
[01:09:18] does and like roughly how to play her I
[01:09:21] just don't know what does what in her
[01:09:22] kit
[01:09:37] let me craft some I I think I have more
[01:09:41] damn okay I'll just use my
[01:09:45] things you know what let's go Auto
[01:09:47] Battle it [ __ ]
[01:09:50] it level dude my skills like level seven
[01:09:53] okay it's it's we're going to get
[01:09:54] everything like just chill we'll get
[01:09:56] there man we'll get
[01:10:07] there uh yeah it's
[01:10:10] fine we'll get everything to N I think
[01:10:13] we'll do 999 or something or like
[01:10:16] 988 existence
[01:10:20] is tell everything why did she take her
[01:10:23] shirt off oh no never mind I we've been
[01:10:25] over this chat we talked about this she
[01:10:26] enters the suit cuz it's warm cuz Sam is
[01:10:29] a barbecue I remember I remember I
[01:10:32] remember no no we've been over this I'm
[01:10:39] sorry oh does she not have relics oh
[01:10:42] [ __ ]
[01:10:44] [ __ ] [ __ ] okay okay before before I
[01:10:47] embarrass myself let me get Ron Mar the
[01:10:49] [ __ ] off of uh ke one second honestly
[01:10:53] break effect speed that's
[01:10:57] good okay this one [ __ ] sucks but
[01:10:59] like don't talk to me do I have another
[01:11:01] one I actually farmed vonck recent like
[01:11:03] literally like three days ago but I
[01:11:05] think I salvaged my ropes unless I have
[01:11:07] I probably I don't think I salvaged all
[01:11:08] of them did I HP never
[01:11:11] mind okay
[01:11:16] yeah was using ke on dot okay you think
[01:11:19] I keep my characters I can't build
[01:11:21] everyone at once [ __ ] look at
[01:11:23] this look at this 17 one speed still
[01:11:25] wolf I probably have to yoink this okay
[01:11:27] like I like I can't I can't juggle
[01:11:30] everything on everyone it's hard
[01:11:34] okay anyways Boot Hill has my um so
[01:11:40] these are on plus zero cuz I was I was
[01:11:41] going to give this break set to I was
[01:11:43] going to like two be 2 be Firefly but
[01:11:45] then I was like I stalled the stream for
[01:11:47] so long that I farmed the new domain the
[01:11:51] new Cavern of KUSI for like a year like
[01:11:54] I showed this earlier but like look at
[01:11:56] how much [ __ ] I have this is all the new
[01:11:59] one so I um can probably run her I also
[01:12:03] leveled some pieces oh speaking of which
[01:12:06] why when I level a break set do I get
[01:12:09] like a [ __ ] god roll crit
[01:12:11] piece I'm not complaining but I'm
[01:12:13] complaining one second where is
[01:12:16] it like I know it missed like a roller
[01:12:19] two but like two speed 23 crit damage
[01:12:22] this is [ __ ] good
[01:12:26] I don't need this
[01:12:28] man
[01:12:31] anyways
[01:12:37] fine
[01:12:39] um okay let me equip I I'm pretty sure I
[01:12:41] have my gear on links I think I gave my
[01:12:45] gear to Links you might be like why
[01:12:46] links well why the [ __ ] not that is my
[01:12:49] counter
[01:12:51] argument uh here it is speed break
[01:12:56] effect okay it's plus zero cuz I'm like
[01:12:58] we'll roll this together look at how
[01:12:59] much I farmed by the way I'm not even
[01:13:01] joking this okay my gloves [ __ ] suck
[01:13:04] I didn't get a single hand that has
[01:13:05] break effect and speed in like a million
[01:13:07] [ __ ] stamina re literally farming
[01:13:09] every day and refreshing not full
[01:13:11] refreshing but a little bit
[01:13:13] anyways body I got an attack one with
[01:13:16] break good enough no speed but like [ __ ]
[01:13:20] you boots we okay boots are a bit
[01:13:25] embarrassing you don't need speed Subs
[01:13:28] okay well like wait really wait why I
[01:13:32] mean or attack I mean there's not oh
[01:13:34] there's attack here actually never mind
[01:13:35] okay
[01:13:37] fine also why am I trusting twitch
[01:13:42] chat give me your argument as to
[01:13:48] why you already hit break points what
[01:13:51] the [ __ ] are you
[01:14:01] don't talk to
[01:14:10] me you're like 140 with level 10 Talent
[01:14:13] oh yeah wait surely I have my level 10
[01:14:17] talents okay but like 9.7 and 10 that's
[01:14:19] like that's not like really a difference
[01:14:27] that's not like really a difference also
[01:14:29] also also you're probably factoring in
[01:14:34] do I have
[01:14:36] wait brother I don't I assume you're
[01:14:39] factoring this in I listen it just came
[01:14:42] out like do you expect me to have this
[01:14:45] do you expect me to have
[01:14:50] this so yes I do need speed [ __ ]
[01:14:54] how would I like
[01:15:00] I got this in the first
[01:15:02] day K why wouldn't I just go for like
[01:15:10] okay I feel like I don't want to farm it
[01:15:13] man like just for
[01:15:16] Firefly just strong MOX it yeah but at
[01:15:18] that point why don't they just [ __ ]
[01:15:19] tally so I also get a piece for my
[01:15:22] booill I don't know don't talk to me
[01:15:26] I guess Gallagher
[01:15:27] too don't talk to me uh anyways we are
[01:15:32] forced to run Talia just so you know
[01:15:34] tiia I don't have good
[01:15:36] Subs it is what it is though oh I
[01:15:39] removed it wait no I didn't oh it was on
[01:15:41] my
[01:15:42] [ __ ] oh wait maybe I was going to
[01:15:44] farm it wait maybe I was planning I
[01:15:46] forget what I was planning wait was I
[01:15:47] planning to Farm It Maybe I'm just
[01:15:50] yapping out of my ass okay let me level
[01:15:51] some stuff first
[01:15:55] effect res
[01:15:59] T speed
[01:16:04] T break effect
[01:16:13] t attack not even
[01:16:22] percent Salvage of four stars
[01:16:25] I feel like it's less satisfying okay
[01:16:28] never mind maybe I will I just got two
[01:16:30] flat attack
[01:16:32] rolls it's good enough do I have break
[01:16:34] and attack percent I don't think I do I
[01:16:36] would have locked it
[01:16:41] yeah what' I do okay maybe
[01:16:58] break break break break break break
[01:17:00] break
[01:17:06] break I mean we take attack percent but
[01:17:09] like can I have
[01:17:13] break okay I probably should Salvage
[01:17:16] you're right break break break break
[01:17:18] break
[01:17:19] break wait this piece is insane wait
[01:17:22] this piece is insane and it's like a one
[01:17:24] to one all things are equal this piece
[01:17:26] is insane okay we're we're actually we
[01:17:28] win we win and we have an attack body
[01:17:30] with break as long as it rolls break we
[01:17:31] literally can't lose let me Salvage for
[01:17:33] your
[01:17:34] pleasure
[01:17:36] Salvage fine quick select four stars are
[01:17:39] below boom I weep for the discarded
[01:17:46] boom relics okay ignore
[01:17:49] the okay but like this isn't even bad
[01:17:52] like I'm not even joking five-speed four
[01:17:54] break is is not even bad don't talk to
[01:17:56] me right now it's literally not even bad
[01:17:59] it's not bad it's not bad it's literally
[01:18:03] not
[01:18:05] bad honestly [ __ ]
[01:18:08] it [ __ ]
[01:18:14] it that's
[01:18:16] good okay we're actually like our silver
[01:18:19] I just called her silver wolf our
[01:18:20] Firefly is [ __ ] goated okay our boots
[01:18:22] kind of suck uh I'm going to be honest
[01:18:25] our boots kind of suck but it's okay
[01:18:28] it's not easy to get good
[01:18:31] boots
[01:18:43] um okay I'm going to have to Auto Battle
[01:18:45] some more wait let me read everything so
[01:18:47] I'm not like
[01:18:48] plugy uh where did I [ __ ] I mean I
[01:18:50] like I read it but
[01:18:51] like earlier than she was released like
[01:18:54] it's been like [ __ ] 4 weeks since I
[01:18:57] okay let's do okay uh where the [ __ ] do
[01:18:59] I start let's start with uh I usually
[01:19:01] start with Talent the lower the HP the
[01:19:02] less damage received yep when HP is 20%
[01:19:04] or lower the damage reduction reaches
[01:19:06] its Max effect okay during the complete
[01:19:08] combustion the damage reduction remains
[01:19:09] at its Max effect and the effect res is
[01:19:11] increased If energy is lower than 50
[01:19:13] when battle starts get 50 energy once
[01:19:16] energy is regenerated to its Max topel
[01:19:17] all debuffs okay consume HP equal to 40%
[01:19:21] of this unit's Max HP regenerate a fixed
[01:19:23] amount of energy equal to 57 well it's
[01:19:25] probably like
[01:19:27] 60% of this unit Max Energy deals fire
[01:19:30] damage equal to S attack to a single
[01:19:32] Target enemy if HP is
[01:19:35] not 40% reduce s HP to one using this
[01:19:39] skill Advance the unit's next action by
[01:19:48] 25% blast restore HP by an amount equal
[01:19:51] to 25% of Zen's Max HP this one consumes
[01:19:53] 40
[01:19:55] apply fire weakness to a single Target
[01:19:57] enemy lasting for two turns deal fire
[01:19:58] damage equal
[01:20:00] to break effect
[01:20:04] plus uh percentage of Sam's attack to
[01:20:06] his Target at the same time adjacent
[01:20:07] enemies yeah break effect taken yeah
[01:20:10] okay ultimate enter the complete
[01:20:13] combustion State advancing this unit's
[01:20:15] action by
[01:20:21] 100% sorry I was look say uh advancing
[01:20:24] un AC 100% so you go again gain enhance
[01:20:27] basic enhance skill which is this and
[01:20:28] then basic is this okay while in
[01:20:33] complete combustion increases speed by
[01:20:34] 40 I guess oh wait that's a
[01:20:38] lot Jesus Christ why is the alt Talent
[01:20:42] so good what the
[01:20:45] [ __ ] okay I'm assuming 60 at level
[01:20:50] 10 uh and when using the enhanced basic
[01:20:53] enhan skill increases units weakness
[01:20:54] break
[01:20:57] efficiency by 50% and the break damage
[01:21:00] dealt by Sam to the enemy T this
[01:21:02] character is [ __ ] stupid and the
[01:21:05] break damage like in a good way the
[01:21:06] break damage dealt by Sam to the enemy
[01:21:09] targets by seven by I guess 20% lasting
[01:21:12] until this current attack ends a
[01:21:15] countdown timer for the complete
[01:21:16] combustion State appears on the action
[01:21:18] order when the countdown timer turn
[01:21:20] starts Sam exits the state count timers
[01:21:23] a fixed speed of 70 okay can use the
[01:21:25] ultimate while in complete combustion so
[01:21:27] you can't alt again when you're inner
[01:21:28] alt is that what it
[01:21:30] means okay let me read these during
[01:21:33] complete combustion attack enemies that
[01:21:35] have no fire weakness wait that have no
[01:21:38] fire weakness can also reduce their
[01:21:40] toughness with the effect being
[01:21:42] equivalent to 55% that's pretty good
[01:21:45] that's like uh so there's her and acaron
[01:21:48] right that can do that cool
[01:21:56] when Sam is in a complete combustion
[01:21:57] State uh with a break effect that is
[01:22:00] equal to or greater than 200 or 360
[01:22:03] attacking a weakness broken enemy will
[01:22:05] convert the tough wait a weakness broken
[01:22:08] enemy will convert the toughness
[01:22:09] reduction into Super break damage okay
[01:22:14] for every 10 points of Sam's attack that
[01:22:16] exceeds 1,800 increase the unus break
[01:22:18] effect by
[01:22:20] 08 that's pretty [ __ ] good
[01:22:30] okay I'm not fully built right now I
[01:22:31] don't have an attack Ball but like let's
[01:22:33] say I put a random attack ball on uh
[01:22:37] wait hello attack
[01:22:41] ball 2600 let's say I have like I don't
[01:22:44] even have my boots level let's have 2700
[01:22:50] attack why is this [ __ ] full screen
[01:22:59] 2700 minus
[01:23:02] 900 900 divided by 10 that's 90 90
[01:23:07] time8 wait I [ __ ] up the math on
[01:23:11] this uh it's divided right 08 it's
[01:23:15] divided it's divided it's divided
[01:23:16] divided divided divided divided
[01:23:24] wait am I wait no no my mouth is [ __ ] my
[01:23:26] mouth is [ __ ] wait every 10 place that
[01:23:28] se one sec one sec one sec it's one wait
[01:23:31] wait wa wait no I got it I actually got
[01:23:35] it 72 is correct okay I got it I got it
[01:23:38] I got it it's 72 it's 72 it's
[01:23:40] 72 it's 72 it's 72 it's 72 72 sorry
[01:23:44] sorry lyone gives attack true but how
[01:23:48] much 16 * 4 it's actually not bad that's
[01:23:50] actually a lot of
[01:23:51] attack wait it works all the time right
[01:23:54] yeah it does module what the [ __ ] that's
[01:23:57] like
[01:23:58] gamma beta
[01:24:02] Alpha wait what is this is this gamma
[01:24:04] was I right was I actually
[01:24:10] right yes I got it
[01:24:15] gamma okay we have to Auto we need a bit
[01:24:18] more rage fangs so let's go Auto Battle
[01:24:21] but okay I don't have
[01:24:23] a don't talk to me don't talk to me
[01:24:25] don't talk to me it's fine we have our
[01:24:27] gear just like let me get some
[01:24:31] mats don't talk to me
[01:24:34] is oh wait my Ron May is still on oh no
[01:24:37] she's not she's not by the
[01:24:39] wind let's improvise fit check I'm
[01:24:43] wearing
[01:24:44] shorts I everything burns to ashes as
[01:24:49] just craft it I should honestly I will
[01:24:51] just for
[01:24:53] you attack DET let the show begin hey z
[01:24:58] x just wanted to ask are you still going
[01:25:00] to make the abis quality video or can
[01:25:02] clip channels have it uh so that video I
[01:25:05] gave it to Su he's editing it right now
[01:25:07] but I I do want clip channels to have
[01:25:09] more content so you guys like you guys
[01:25:10] can do anything just don't make like a
[01:25:11] full dedicated video on it but you can
[01:25:13] use parts of it that's fine to
[01:25:17] live all will be swept away by but
[01:25:19] there's a lot of video ideas that I have
[01:25:21] and then they never get made into videos
[01:25:22] and then so they never get posted
[01:25:24] anywhere so I'm always like uh but this
[01:25:26] one this one's being edited right now I
[01:25:27] just got an
[01:25:33] achievement the mods B the guy in chat
[01:25:35] that just got a
[01:25:37] girlfriend they're not welcome
[01:25:40] here okay I I hate
[01:25:43] that okay never mind I'm sorry why does
[01:25:46] he okay like I like Gallagher he's great
[01:25:48] okay but why does he go
[01:25:52] H still
[01:25:55] all will be swept away by the
[01:26:00] wind I don't think it's bad I don't
[01:26:02] think it's bad it's just it's just
[01:26:06] funny my
[01:26:08] friends indulge
[01:26:15] [Music]
[01:26:17] yourselves uh I'll probably look into do
[01:26:19] I need to [ __ ] Cal my speed on
[01:26:21] Firefly or do I just assume I have
[01:26:23] enough
[01:26:25] let's
[01:26:27] improvise well not now like with boots
[01:26:30] do I have a few Subs I don't know I can
[01:26:32] look need 210 yeah but there's like a
[01:26:34] million Buffs isn't
[01:26:37] there like you get like 60 or 70 I think
[01:26:40] it's like 60 and then Ron gives you
[01:26:44] 10% my
[01:26:47] friends 154 is enough is that without
[01:26:49] the set or with the set existence is
[01:26:52] unity all will be Swept Away by the

[01:29:29] I guess I could force the Rope the Rope
[01:29:30] is not a problem I could force it but
[01:29:32] the the ball like I need I could force
[01:29:35] attack but I feel like forcing attack is
[01:29:37] such a waste cuz like you get a lot of
[01:29:39] attack
[01:29:51] balls not worth I mean the thing is I
[01:29:55] also already have a good
[01:29:57] Talia actually no I don't I don't have a

[01:31:24] anyways um let's let's keep going so
[01:31:26] okay wait so fine okay I'll let Destiny
[01:31:30] decide my fate I'm going to craft one
[01:31:32] ball but I'm not going to force craft
[01:31:34] anything if it gets attack we use the
[01:31:37] set if it doesn't we use like some some
[01:31:39] other
[01:31:43] ball okay I mean that's good enough
[01:31:45] that's good enough that's good enough no
[01:31:47] speed but break effect that's good
[01:31:48] enough okay cool and we'll Force craft
[01:31:50] okay well Destiny decided for me thank
[01:31:53] you thank you uh streamer luck I guess
[01:31:56] uh okay let's salvage some things I
[01:31:58] don't want to salvage these because I
[01:31:59] want to show you guys how much I did off
[01:32:00] stream but now that I'm streaming I
[01:32:01] could [ __ ] salvage anything so we're
[01:32:03] going to I'm going to manually click
[01:32:05] just to
[01:32:06] not I guess my face Cam's covering the
[01:32:08] stats but crit damage that sucks it's
[01:32:12] fine I'll get
[01:32:15] 300 all right 300 well 320 whatever
[01:32:24] filter to only include useless stats
[01:32:26] yeah but like useless is
[01:32:28] relative I guess it depends on the set
[01:32:30] what the [ __ ] did I just do oh it's
[01:32:32] the what the
[01:32:37] [ __ ] hello wait that I just hello I'm
[01:32:42] hello I bugged the [ __ ]
[01:32:48] technique anyways let's let's level our
[01:32:51] pce
[01:32:54] look my laptop is not the best okay wait
[01:32:56] no let's synthesize wait I can't access
[01:32:58] the I just open my GeForce
[01:33:03] experience okay uh let's level this
[01:33:10] ball oh that's good wait I forgot I plus
[01:33:12] 15 I thought I was just plus three in it
[01:33:14] but nice it's not like the best but 16
[01:33:17] break is good you can't complain about
[01:33:19] 16 break you can't first ball ever you
[01:33:21] can't complain okay to be fair I rolled
[01:33:23] a few of them off stream uh they all
[01:33:25] sucked
[01:33:26] but one's good oh dude I was doing tiia
[01:33:30] look at this
[01:33:31] [ __ ] sor I thought I saw someone look at
[01:33:33] this look at this are you
[01:33:38] ready when am I ever GNA I mean
[01:33:48] actually I'm never using this
[01:33:51] like you guys are typing
[01:33:54] I know you would type that but like it's
[01:33:56] not
[01:33:58] even I don't even put it on her like
[01:34:00] it's not even what I would want on her
[01:34:02] and also
[01:34:08] like also like it's probably an offset
[01:34:11] piece but like there's no offset but
[01:34:13] like like do I just have to throw this
[01:34:15] do I just have to embrace that it sucks
[01:34:25] break silverwolf
[01:34:27] Idiot Brother does a break silverwolf
[01:34:30] build want you would want break not crit
[01:34:33] rate crit like what are you talking
[01:34:35] about I mean it has hit rate I
[01:34:41] guess I don't know I'll keep it anyways
[01:34:44] we got a good orp let's Okay I I think I
[01:34:46] actually glitched the game I'm sorry I'm
[01:34:48] actually sorry it's my laptop's fault
[01:34:49] it's not star's fault uh the game is
[01:34:51] actually pretty well optimized it is not
[01:34:54] listen it's on me not them okay I'm
[01:35:07] sorry oh wait I can probably teleport
[01:35:10] probably just teleport
[01:35:12] away there you go
[01:35:17] debugged I
[01:35:19] think oh yeah cool all right that was
[01:35:22] easy uh um let me craft this thing
[01:35:25] though wait what there's no hotkey for
[01:35:26] [ __ ] synthesize
[01:35:28] right
[01:35:30] boom boom boom boom briak effect boom
[01:35:36] boom boom now we have a set you know
[01:35:39] what I don't even care if this doesn't
[01:35:41] have attack percent and speed but it
[01:35:46] has flat attack I mean that's pretty
[01:35:48] terrible
[01:35:50] but should I force another one no right
[01:35:54] again no dude no I'm using two
[01:35:59] right I want to but I know I
[01:36:02] shouldn't let's see let's see okay it
[01:36:04] would be dumb to force if I don't see
[01:36:06] the last
[01:36:09] stat plus three let me enhance the next
[01:36:13] node speed attack effect
[01:36:20] res I mean honestly though like break
[01:36:22] can't get break sub attack percent and
[01:36:24] speed are good but like that's
[01:36:27] fine it's fine surely we're not wasting
[01:36:31] a [ __ ] thing
[01:36:44] right one more can't
[01:36:49] hurt dude there's a reason why I have
[01:36:52] seven [ __ ] self modulating resins man
[01:36:55] because I don't like I'm smart with them
[01:36:57] and I don't waste them on a piece for
[01:37:03] one this is like the
[01:37:10] same stop saying one
[01:37:18] more
[01:37:20] okay do I even care about her that much
[01:37:39] I know this is dumb I don't want
[01:37:43] to what what else do I need let me think
[01:38:00] okay okay this game is dude whatever I'm
[01:38:04] done I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm done
[01:38:05] I'm done I'm done like we didn't get a
[01:38:08] single useful
[01:38:12] substat oh wait oh plus
[01:38:21] 50 I thought I plus three
[01:38:26] it I mean we got two speed at least like
[01:38:30] it's I would have dude I would have been
[01:38:32] so hyped if I just saw the speed number
[01:38:34] appear but instead it appeared but it
[01:38:35] didn't change there was no up
[01:38:38] Arrow I'm going to lock this one oops
[01:38:40] I'm going to lock this one just in
[01:38:43] case wait our speed is oh yeah we didn't
[01:38:46] level our
[01:38:49] boots wait we we have enough speed
[01:38:51] though right cuz let's say we do this
[01:38:52] plus 25
[01:38:55] five wait no we don't wait we do with
[01:38:57] the set we do with the set we do with
[01:38:59] the set we have enough with the
[01:39:03] set cuz we need 154 right 6% that's
[01:39:07] enough what's her base speed
[01:39:13] 104 it's not in battle wow that's speed
[01:39:18] I think you should level it xdd look I'm
[01:39:20] not making a firefly guide so you can't
[01:39:22] l w me
[01:39:24] I'm not expected to know
[01:39:27] this oh it shows already wait let me
[01:39:30] read it oh yeah yeah it
[01:39:34] does wait that means I need like two
[01:39:36] more subs recing minus 5 dude I'm why do
[01:39:40] you guys think I'm
[01:39:45] balding wait oops wrong
[01:39:47] piece what the [ __ ] did I just do oh I
[01:39:50] just wait
[01:39:58] [ __ ]
[01:39:59] it not bad actually good actually really
[01:40:02] good actually really good like no break
[01:40:03] effect which makes it not really good
[01:40:06] but attack
[01:40:18] percent dude I I like I can't get speed
[01:40:21] on every piece it's hard
[01:40:24] hard honestly okay I saved every three
[01:40:27] liner with breaker speed oh
[01:40:34] no I meant to plus three it I meant to
[01:40:38] [ __ ] do
[01:40:39] this oh my God what did I just
[01:40:43] level I mean it's not even
[01:40:46] bad it's actually not even
[01:40:50] bad uh brick account dude brick
[01:40:55] count wait do I let me see let me see
[01:40:58] like I have I have some like this one if
[01:41:00] it gets break effect actually
[01:41:02] bust crit rate
[01:41:08] tragedy is this one get speed
[01:41:11] bust hit rate tragedy I can't believe I
[01:41:15] wasted all my XP mats on that speed crit
[01:41:18] damage attack if this gu break effect
[01:41:21] bust you don't need more unless you're
[01:41:23] zero cycling I'm zero
[01:41:29] cycling okay I'm not zero cycling today
[01:41:32] but like I'd like to be able to zero
[01:41:37] cycle like okay once I build a character
[01:41:39] I don't look back just so you
[01:41:42] know like I'm not trying to rebuild my
[01:41:45] Firefly in like 3 weeks
[01:41:47] time but if I have to I have to it's
[01:41:49] fine
[01:42:06] brother can I get a single good
[01:42:18] roll okay what the [ __ ] is this
[01:42:25] like it's good
[01:42:38] but in the arms of an
[01:42:48] angel stop typing you have Ron may like
[01:42:51] I don't know I have Ron May
[01:42:54] [Laughter]
[01:43:07] like I can't get a single
[01:43:12] please
[01:43:13] [Music]
[01:43:15] please yeah look at this [ __ ] too attack
[01:43:19] crit
[01:43:20] crit top
[01:43:30] I mean it's fine we like we don't need
[01:43:32] more like I we don't need more speed
[01:43:35] we're we're
[01:43:36] fine but like getting more would be
[01:43:38] would be would be a little POG like a
[01:43:40] mini POG
[01:43:46] champ cuz we're probably doing simulated
[01:43:48] Universe anyways in which case it
[01:43:49] doesn't matter but I'm also going to do
[01:43:51] mock y mock
[01:43:59] okay if this gets speed 100 no four
[01:44:02] gifted five I God
[01:44:06] defense I'm going to mold surely one of
[01:44:10] the pieces I farmed gets speed break
[01:44:19] effect
[01:44:20] okay surely one of the people Jesus
[01:44:25] right well it's [ __ ]
[01:44:28] J oh speed break effect's not that rare
[01:44:31] break effect I just plus one it break
[01:44:34] effect break effect's not that rare
[01:44:36] break effect's not that
[01:44:42] rare I'm going to lose it I'm going to
[01:44:45] lose I'm going to I'm going to I'm going

[01:44:55] okay honestly like [ __ ] it I think we
[01:44:57] just go with what we have it is what it
[01:44:58] is I think we just take what we
[01:45:01] have Bust or maybe wait unless I had a
[01:45:05] body with speed and break that I didn't
[01:45:10] see I could filter but I'm
[01:45:16] lazy no I
[01:45:19] don't craft one I'm not crafting one
[01:45:23] it's okay
[01:45:25] honestly good
[01:45:36] enough okay let me level this then but I
[01:45:39] feel like if I level the talent then I
[01:45:41] have to level the [ __ ] like I'm not

[01:51:43] spam that
[01:51:46] right should I [ __ ] Force CRA dude I
[01:51:48] should have just farmed the set normally
[01:51:53] should I forcecraft another
[01:51:56] one surely we're not force crafting
[01:51:58] another one
[01:52:04] right I'm going to do
[01:52:06] it there's a 2X planner
[01:52:09] event that's not even out on

[01:52:28] set but it was on uh it's on silverwolf
[01:52:30] am I Bening silver
[01:52:37] wolf everyone said y holy [ __ ] okay I
[01:52:40] guess we're benching silver
[01:52:41] wolf 11 speed oh don't mind if I
[01:52:46] do you're just going to regear
[01:52:48] everything on
[01:53:02] okay our Firefly is like far from ideal
[01:53:05] but she's good enough okay this is our
[01:53:06] body this is our hand this is our body
[01:53:09] wait oh I said body for this is our head
[01:53:12] hand body feet mind and
[01:53:16] soul eventually we'll get a bit more
[01:53:18] speed bit more break effect
[01:53:24] so I know for a fact this character is
[01:53:26] [ __ ] broken but I haven't played them
[01:53:28] yet so we're about to find out why we're
[01:53:30] about to find out why EXC okay give me
[01:53:33] like three combats to like okay I'm
[01:53:36] allowed three buffers like I'm allowed
[01:53:38] three combats where I'm allowed to
[01:53:39] misplay and then it'll be perfect
[01:53:41] gameplay let me let me get a bit more
[01:53:43] mats first though
[01:53:54] how much crit value dude I'm playing a
[01:53:56] break character what are you talking to
[01:53:57] me oh what are you talking
[01:54:00] about all will be swept away by the
[01:54:08] wind i s everything burns to ashes let
[01:54:13] the show begin wait what's Fire's base
[01:54:14] speed
[01:54:16] 104 fight to live Ron ma BFF is based on
[01:54:20] your base right set the
[01:54:23] [Music]
[01:54:24] so 10% of 104 is 10.4 which I guess is
[01:54:27] rounded to
[01:54:28] 10 well I guess it's 10.4 cuz there's
[01:54:31] [ __ ] decimals in this game
[01:54:33] decb my
[01:54:36] friends indulge yourselves so 10 plus
[01:54:40] what the [ __ ] do we have exact value
[01:54:42] matters yeah I know 10 we have we start
[01:54:46] with 14 we have what 147 let's assume it
[01:54:48] rounds up to 148 cuz it's hidden value
[01:54:51] so let's say 15 eight speed right
[01:54:54] now then we also
[01:54:56] get Sam gives what 60 or how much how
[01:55:00] much is
[01:55:02] Sam uh wait let me
[01:55:07] pause Oh wait we're [ __ ] chilling I
[01:55:09] could just press wait wait we're

[02:26:27] it's a it's a very break Abyss even the
[02:26:29] Trotters like um well primarily the well
[02:26:32] it's all the Trotters but like even the
[02:26:33] like being able to go again is
[02:26:36] like really good for breaking enemies on
[02:26:38] top of it just being good in like it's
[02:26:40] good in general for everyone but like
[02:26:42] break enemies is even better for Break
[02:26:44] characters so t

[02:29:53] huge yeah like like like like like like
[02:29:57] what is

[03:05:19] here
[03:05:21] nice okay node
[03:05:23] Forge
[03:05:30] Forge now it's
[03:05:32] time to actually play the game proceed
[03:05:35] to challenge tenacious resolve reduces
[03:05:38] damage received by all enemies but every
[03:05:40] weakness type they
[03:05:42] have increases damage
[03:05:45] received okay
[03:05:48] so implanting a weakness is good Firefly
[03:05:51] propaganda booill
[03:05:56] propaganda well not really but well it
[03:05:59] could be but no okay
[03:06:06] um I think we'll just do I mean yeah we
[03:06:08] have silver for first half as
[03:06:15] well all right I think think we're going
[03:06:17] to do what is this Stellar protector for
[03:06:19] every unit on the enemy side of the
[03:06:20] field aside from boss
[03:06:24] Mirage all enemies receive less damage
[03:06:27] and deal more
[03:06:30] damage okay wo maintenance done I think
[03:06:35] yeah we'll get to that after this but
[03:06:38] we're we're we're honky ring honing our
[03:06:40] rail of the Stars
[03:06:44] what difficulty four beat my ass yeah
[03:06:46] well I'm built different so I will beat
[03:06:48] difficulty Four's
[03:06:58] ass go go my S is a bit too low speed no
[03:07:02] it's
[03:07:07] fine all right are we just running the
[03:07:09] same two teams I mean I think it'll be
[03:07:11] fine okay pail to be fair okay paila has
[03:07:13] like no use case here well nothing's
[03:07:16] weak to ice as at
[03:07:23] all thoughts on Black Swan
[03:07:54] first half genu
[03:08:01] please does he
[03:08:08] know I don't even know which rope I
[03:08:10] usually like whose rope I give to
[03:08:14] her I'll just take this one Whatever
[03:08:17] that's one actually [ __ ] sucks
[03:08:45] [Music]
[03:08:54] [Music]
[03:08:59] is there any Merit we could play a DOT
[03:09:01] team but I kind of don't want to is
[03:09:02] there any Merit to doing
[03:09:06] this cuz skill point efficiency doesn't
[03:09:09] matter if we get skill points for free
[03:09:11] the her death sh is like 20
[03:09:14] 22 no no no that's not death sh death
[03:09:16] sh's on the skill 20 yeah it's 20 well
[03:09:19] it's higher but yeah 20 and then it's uh
[03:09:22] vulnerability 22% paila is
[03:09:25] like well also has the L
[03:09:29] cone I guess I could give it to no I
[03:09:34] can't actually I could we get energy
[03:09:37] right so I don't need the [ __ ] energy
[03:09:38] lone here I need the effect hit rate
[03:09:42] it's only
[03:09:44] 16% honestly I think it'll be fine
[03:09:47] I think we kind of want the
[03:09:55] break yeah okay we'll try it first try
[03:10:00] zero deaths full clear it's going to
[03:10:04] happen it's going to happen acaron
[03:10:07] Firefly it's going to work
[03:10:10] hopefully
[03:10:13] um [ __ ]
[03:10:15] it of blades
[03:10:24] okay that's
[03:10:26] fine

[03:10:41] like a [ __ ] ton of debuffs anyways I'm
[03:10:44] not sure if you focus uh kakia or
[03:10:48] gy no matter it's
[03:10:51] fine time for aun just implant all our
[03:10:54] debuffs this is double
[03:10:57] speed Destiny isn't chosen uh skill
[03:11:02] here when we break we get all our like
[03:11:04] we get skill points back and we get all
[03:11:05] our ultimates so and G I see through you

[03:11:27] ALT but I could basic or I could attack
[03:11:29] jard now if I attack jard I lose a
[03:11:31] crimson no stack it's going be 81
[03:11:32] instead of

[03:25:30] qualified like I didn't like I'm just
[03:25:33] playing her for fun but there might be
[03:25:34] like a normal like second Channel video
[03:25:36] I think Jade I might make a guide for
[03:25:39] even though that's like the dumbest
[03:25:40] thing to do like analytic wise cuz no
[03:25:42] one cares about Jade compared to Firefly
[03:25:44] but I like Jade the timing was just bad
[03:25:46] like I feel like I was forced to not
[03:25:48] make a firefly video cuz I wasn't there
[03:25:49] like I wasn't home so like it's not like
[03:25:51] I was like I hate her it was just like I
[03:25:52] I had no time that's also why I didn't
[03:25:55] do a yland video for wa wah but I don't
[03:26:00] know we'll
[03:26:05] see
[03:26:07] okay Hony star
[03:26:09] rail Firefly look at her eyes
[03:26:14] beautiful would you die for Firefly I
[03:26:16] would no I wouldn't but you know she's
[03:26:19] she's cool okay um with that said
[03:26:22] chat we're going to do more star rail
[03:26:24] streams very soon I think we're going to
[03:26:26] do the the Candy Crush event with chat
[03:26:28] so we'll probably do another Star Stream
[03:26:30] and we have to do the 3. 2.3 Quest so
[03:26:33] probably doing both in the same stream
[03:26:34] sometime this week not even joking
[03:26:36] sometime this week okay
[03:26:39] probably also Jade comes out in like two
[03:26:43] weeks or one week two weeks oh okay with
[03:26:46] that in mind
[03:26:48] chat we're not ending in fact we barely
[03:26:51] just
[03:26:52] begun we are now going to play the new
[03:26:57] Wawa live uh
[03:26:59] patch
[03:27:02] now a quick disclaimer so I'm going to
[03:27:06] play I was going to play the wa patch
[03:27:07] regardless same with star rail same with
[03:27:09] uh like you know whatever I want to play
[03:27:12] I play uh and this is going to be so 2
[03:27:15] hours hash ad okay so I there's going to
[03:27:18] be a logo on screen but everything else
[03:27:19] is going to be the same and there's
[03:27:20] nothing like Okay the reason I'm telling
[03:27:22] you this is because I'm I was going to
[03:27:23] be home but I'm on my like second setup
[03:27:27] and while I'm going to build a PC here
[03:27:29] for now I'm on a laptop and weathering
[03:27:32] wavves in my opinion is a very fun game
[03:27:34] a a very you know I enjoy the game a lot
[03:27:37] however um I don't know if my laptop is
[03:27:40] optimized enough to run it uh
[03:27:43] efficiently so I don't know just
[03:27:46] downloaded it like before starting
[03:27:48] stream I downloaded it cuz I've been
[03:27:49] playing obviously I play at home but
[03:27:51] I've been playing on mobile like on the
[03:27:52] road I've been playing I've been farming

[03:27:55] dailies okay which you know is not that
[03:27:58] bad when you're vacationing and you're
[03:27:59] in Asia so the time Zone's different so
[03:28:01] your like clock is different and yeah

[03:41:34] sorry look all I'm going to say is
[03:41:36] there's a reason I keep a Jeff in a cage
[03:41:40] also I definitely missed one day of one
[03:41:43] of the events cuz I was like oh I'll do
[03:41:44] it on the last last day and then the
[03:41:45] last day passed but it's okay on the
[03:41:47] last day of Christmas my true love gave
[03:41:50] to me we're going to do the
[03:41:55] trial we're going to do the
[03:41:58] trial I'm going to close my Google
[03:42:00] Chrome so I don't lag we your
[03:42:07] trial um okay I kind of know what she
[03:42:10] does like my understanding of her is you
[03:42:12] can
[03:42:12] like I think you can like effectively
[03:42:15] cast intro skills on her without
[03:42:16] swapping but I don't know if that's
[03:42:17] another character Sask I don't know but
[03:42:19] I know that you're you um basically you
[03:42:22] want characters that do coordinated
[03:42:24] attacks ideally of different like
[03:42:26] elements but I don't know let's read
[03:42:28] okay Forte gauge is restored when
[03:42:30] resonators inflict attribute damage or
[03:42:33] coordinated attack damage okay
[03:42:36] yes JY May consume Forte gauge to
[03:42:39] provide additional damage multipliers
[03:42:42] fors okay uh attribute damage
[03:42:45] effectively this just means coordinate
[03:42:46] attacks though right cuz like you you
[03:42:48] don't want to swap out of her so you
[03:42:49] want characters that do off field damage
[03:42:51] which is basically coordinated attacks
[03:42:53] so mortify yinlin and technically Yan wo
[03:42:55] but if you play Yan wo then [ __ ] I
[03:42:58] don't know no disrespect sorry uh
[03:43:00] Incarnation after four basics or intro
[03:43:01] skill use e after basic four or intro

[03:49:48] much [ __ ] I got so technically I don't
[03:49:50] know if she has like damage bonus or
[03:49:51] attack percent in her kit but for most
[03:49:53] characters it's okay if you run one on
[03:49:55] attack percent so I locked a few attack
[03:49:57] percent ones just in case um oh wait the
[03:50:00] flat attack one is attack I didn't even
[03:50:01] notice but yeah we have a few attack

[03:58:24] about so no comment like I'm not
[03:58:28] sure
[03:58:30] but other two are good the only thing is
[03:58:34] I um the thing with jiny is like she
[03:58:37] looks really strong okay we'll see we
[03:58:38] haven't played her yet but like she
[03:58:39] looks her kid looks strong I just worry
[03:58:41] about her team flexibility if you don't
[03:58:44] have yinlin cuz it right now it feels
[03:58:47] like you want okay let me read her
[03:58:48] abilities before I
[03:58:50] Yap uh okay so that's normal Dash
[03:58:54] forward do Spectra damage uh after using
[03:58:57] basic attack four or while not in
[03:58:59] Incarnation intro
[03:59:03] skill long Halo L Halo and alternative
[03:59:07] residence skill
[03:59:12] overflowing oh okay I get it after using
[03:59:15] jiny's basic gu 4 or her intro skill
[03:59:17] when she's not in Incarnation that's
[03:59:19] what that means an alternative skill is
[03:59:21] available within 5 seconds so four 5
[03:59:24] Seconds resonance skill overflowing
[03:59:26] Radiance inflicts spectral damage and
[03:59:28] sends jiny into
[03:59:34] Incarnation okay so your skill lights up
[03:59:36] after four normals or intro cool how
[03:59:39] long does the form last 10 seconds 3
[03:59:41] second cool down Radiance cool down is
[03:59:43] 12 seconds every 12 seconds you can be
[03:59:45] in a 10-second thing I

[04:00:22] may now gain oh Aras tour may now gain
[04:00:25] incandescence via Aras tour from damage
[04:00:28] of the same attribute more efficiently

[04:00:46] Spectra damage
[04:00:47] bonus multiplier okay Chad are we ready
[04:00:50] I'm sorry we have to do it guide maker I
[04:00:52] by the way I have to Oh my Jesus this
[04:00:55] thing
[04:00:56] says T okay we're reading
[04:00:59] it
[04:01:01] okay Incarnation while in Incarnation
[04:01:04] alternative basic attack becomes
[04:01:06] available you can do four hits
[04:01:08] consecutively that are considered skill
[04:01:12] damage okay I'm actually pulling out a
[04:01:14] notepad you think I'm
[04:01:19] joking
[04:01:21] Incarnation enter via four hits or intro
[04:01:31] skill
[04:01:33] yeah press E when
[04:01:36] shiny
[04:01:39] Incarnation four hits of enhanced skill
[04:01:43] damage
[04:01:51] alternative resident skill becomes
[04:01:55] available deal Spectra damage can be
[04:01:57] cast mid air
[04:02:00] okay alternative heavy attack becomes
[04:02:02] available attack the yeah whatever
[04:02:04] alternative Dodge okay alternative okay
[04:02:06] this is fine that's just a bunch of
[04:02:08] attacks to say you have all
[04:02:11] stuff resident skill illuminous Epiphany
[04:02:15] so after stage four of incarnation basic
[04:02:17] attack Incarnation terminates and you be
[04:02:20] you gain ordinary glow does stage four
[04:02:22] mean four normal
[04:02:24] attacks I don't know what stage four
[04:02:26] means I assume it's four normal attacks
[04:02:28] that are considered skill
[04:02:30] damage we can test that
[04:02:33] though after four stage four Naas
[04:02:37] question
[04:02:39] mark
[04:02:41] ordinary glow
[04:02:45] basic attack is replaced with heavy
[04:02:47] attack attack at the cost of stamina
[04:02:51] resident skills replac with the
[04:02:52] resonance skill send out solar flare
[04:02:54] that resonates as Stella glamour deal SP
[04:02:57] short delay consume up to 50
[04:02:58] incandescence each point of
[04:03:00] incandescence wait how much
[04:03:01] incandescence you have they didn't tell
[04:03:03] us
[04:03:05] hello 30
[04:03:11] 20 oh there it is 50 okay so you have 50
[04:03:16] oh it says consume up to 50 okay I guess
[04:03:18] they did tell us my bad okay send a that
[04:03:20] detonates a stellar glamour glamour from
[04:03:24] your skill consume up to 50 with each
[04:03:25] point granting bonus damage multiplier
[04:03:28] percentage to Stella
[04:03:31] glamor Stella glamour additional
[04:03:33] multiplier per incandescence that is a
[04:03:35] lot is that 22 well that's T of level
[04:03:38] one it might go up is that 22 * 50 or am
[04:03:41] I stupid
[04:03:44] it looks like it
[04:03:49] is um Can after casting resident skill
[04:03:53] jiny gains
[04:03:55] Unison what the [ __ ] is
[04:04:00] Unison okay I understand everything
[04:04:02] except oh oh wait wait there's more what
[04:04:04] the [ __ ] oh no okay when jiny has Unison
[04:04:06] switching to other resident oh yeah this
[04:04:08] how you use intro skills I remember will
[04:04:10] remove jiny's Unison to trigger her
[04:04:12] outro skill and the incoming resonater
[04:04:15] intro skill and then you consume it
[04:04:17] instead of conserto
[04:04:22] energy it's basically conserto
[04:04:27] energy incandescence you can hold 50
[04:04:29] when J's in the party all nearby
[04:04:30] resonators are in the party are at the
[04:04:32] Aros tour Aras provides two independent
[04:04:36] effects one giny gains incandescence
[04:04:40] anytime resonators in the party inflict
[04:04:42] attribute damage
[04:04:45] I'm writing this
[04:04:50] down one
[04:04:53] incandescence when
[04:04:56] resonators in the
[04:04:58] party deal attribute damage
[04:05:03] two oh wait this V be triggered by
[04:05:05] damage of the same
[04:05:07] attribute once every 3 seconds same
[04:05:11] attribute once per 3 seconds equal
[04:05:14] different
[04:05:16] attributes in parenthesis
[04:05:20] elements is
[04:05:22] good
[04:05:24] two additionally jiny gains two
[04:05:27] incandescence when resonators in the
[04:05:28] party damage the enemy with coordinated
[04:05:30] attacks plus two from coordinated
[04:05:34] attacks once per 3 seconds per attribute
[04:05:38] okay now a question I have to test if
[04:05:41] you do a coordinated attack of a
[04:05:43] different
[04:05:44] element do you gain three because one
[04:05:47] from here and two from here or do you
[04:05:49] only gain
[04:05:53] two we have to test I don't know if we
[04:06:09] can also this means you want to run
[04:06:11] resonators of different elements however
[04:06:12] outro skills
[04:06:15] say you may now gain incandescence from
[04:06:18] the damage of the same
[04:06:20] attribute more effectively wait what
[04:06:23] does more effectively mean at one time
[04:06:26] oh it's one time every 1 second instead
[04:06:27] of one time every 3
[04:06:29] seconds
[04:06:32] okay with outro
[04:06:36] skill once per three becomes once per
[04:06:41] one I assume this is for
[04:06:45] both okay we understand her
[04:06:50] kit kind of sorry I had to do that now
[04:06:54] we can [ __ ] play the game
[04:06:58] um Chad we we're going to we're going to
[04:07:01] try to get level 50 today okay that's my
[04:07:03] goal that's my goal we're going to spend
[04:07:05] we can spend like fragile whatever
[04:07:07] they're called W flate like blocks my
[04:07:09] sensitivity is really low now uh that is

[04:48:48] y's her best Synergy by far because to
[04:48:50] my
[04:48:52] understanding hindered my progress so I
[04:48:55] trained harder with each session my
[04:48:59] strengths grew uh because so she gains
[04:49:02] Stacks from off field damage coordinated
[04:49:05] attacks and also from different
[04:49:08] attributes different elements so
[04:49:11] Yin does both of those she's lightning
[04:49:13] and she attacks coordinated from off
[04:49:17] field and she's just a really good unit
[04:49:19] that has good

[05:06:45] haven't been able to sense its presence

[05:12:32] Sante did they create these simulated
[05:12:35] Holograms to protect this place
[05:12:48] the I wonder if her animation time stops

[05:22:20] hit it big okay I never need to ever
[05:22:22] look at this Banner ever
[05:22:24] again the only reason I didn't pull on a
[05:22:26] weapon man was like I don't need
[05:22:27] gaunlets cuz I don't have any gaunlet
[05:22:29] character I would ever use

[05:23:14] but since we drowned it was a good okay
[05:23:17] I'm not even kidding though if we didn't
[05:23:19] drown we wouldn't have Encore so was
[05:23:21] technically optimal for me to drown or I
[05:23:23] literally would have be I'd have one
[05:23:25] less five
[05:23:27] star I just drowned
[05:23:30] again wait let me put it in my team I'm

[05:49:21] creatures they weren't safe for long as
[05:49:25] the tacid Discord found them the mother
[05:49:29] sacrificed herself to protect her
[05:49:35] child but with her gone it was difficult
[05:49:38] for the newborn to survive okay not to

[05:49:56] reached the ears of the mighty
[05:50:00] Sentinel with a burst of energy our
[05:50:04] Sentinel dispelled the surrounding ing
[05:50:07] evils but sadly it was too
[05:50:11] late that night Mount firmament that's a

[05:50:25] Embrace as if by Magic somber clouds
[05:50:30] parted and shooting stars lit up the sky
[05:50:34] with Mount firmaments unique flow of
[05:50:37] time the Sentinel brought the deceased
[05:50:40] infant back to
[05:50:43] life the resurrected infant became okay

[06:51:53] I don't like
[06:51:55] [Music]

[06:52:09] [Music]
[06:52:13] well we'll use it for
[06:52:17] now oh I can level my
[06:52:21] weapon eight [ __ ]
[06:52:24] Golds dude do you think I made a [ __ ]
[06:52:27] money
[06:52:38] [Music]
[06:52:41] buy whale pack I mean I have some from
[06:52:43] just the battle pass I
[06:52:47] think I'm not a
[06:52:52] billionaire wait let me open the [ __ ]
[06:52:53] let me open this [ __ ] I think I have
[06:52:58] some is it
[06:53:01] this owned 10 well what if I made it
[06:53:04] [ __ ]
[06:53:09] 20
[06:53:15] synthesize uh wait how many did I
[06:53:18] need was it
[06:53:21] six or was it
[06:53:29] eight eight
[06:53:33] they think I'm made of
[06:53:47] money you got the gold box to pick wait
[06:53:53] really oo it's only four though well I
[06:53:55] have a free fivar weapon okay
[06:54:03] basic attack restores HP
[06:54:06] cool I really want this
[06:54:12] one boom wait maybe I should have
[06:54:15] thought like maybe I should have
[06:54:17] considered pulling for her weapon before
[06:54:18] I level this one to 80 but I don't think
[06:54:20] I want her weapon let me look at it
[06:54:25] again Wherever You Are
[06:54:42] 47
[06:54:43] 514 12% plus
[06:54:55] 48 12% plus well you're not really heavy
[06:54:59] attacking are you
[06:55:19] must pull for crit
[06:55:21] rate H I feel like people overvalue how
[06:55:23] much
[06:55:24] [ __ ] like how hard is to get like
[06:55:27] crit rate is not easy to get but like
[06:55:29] our thing's only plus 15 like we'll have
[06:55:31] enough crit rate I feel like
[06:55:37] like if we get just a plus 25 with a
[06:55:39] crit rate sub stat do I have one
[06:55:55] even like that's already
[06:55:57] 60 and then we probably we can get a
[06:56:00] crit rate on this piece still
[06:56:03] although like it would probably be what
[06:56:04] like let's say 70 at most which like
[06:56:06] isn't the most but it's like
[06:56:11] enough and then there's there's more
[06:56:14] here there's plus 2.8 plus
[06:56:27] 2.8 I don't know if I care about this
[06:56:34] but I'm going to unlock
[06:56:43] it 3333 all ER
[06:56:47] true that is how you're supposed to play
[06:56:49] this
[06:57:00] game I'm just trying to think before I
[06:57:03] okay I think what we do is we keep okay
[06:57:06] before we can do a Showcase of her and
[06:57:07] like I can record a video and stuff we
[06:57:10] need a good
[06:57:11] Echo what I think we do is we keep
[06:57:14] fighting D if we get a good crit rate
[06:57:17] one we keep Gian weapon if we get a
[06:57:19] better crit damage one we pull for her
[06:57:21] weapon we let fate decide however if I
[06:57:23] have to pull for a weapon I'm broke as
[06:57:24] [ __ ] so I don't know what I'll do I'll
[06:57:25] probably have to battle pass and
[06:57:27] [ __ ] or just spend a bunch of resin wave
[06:57:31] plate
[06:57:35] um yeah yeah we'll use we'll use some
[06:57:41] uh I'm going to end the sponsor segment
[06:57:44] we're still going to play W but I'm just
[06:57:45] going to take the thing off the screen
[06:57:47] uh thanks the weather the COO games
[06:57:48] though for the sponsor check out the
[06:57:49] game as weaing waves it's fun I enjoy
[06:57:51] the combat a lot and other stuff 1.
[06:57:53] one's out you can do the quest it's
[06:57:54] pretty fast or or I mean it's fast if
[06:57:56] you skip but you can also just not Skip
[06:57:57] and enjoy it and then yeah cool
[06:58:00] okay poog bog b b bog
[06:58:05] music time that's actually a good point
[06:58:07] that's actually a good
[06:58:09] point now say [ __ ] Wawa okay but I like
[06:58:12] the game like it's
[06:58:19] fun um I should probably play GN here
[06:58:22] though but I kind of don't want to bench
[06:58:25] anyone on my team I don't really want to
[06:58:27] bench jiny
[06:58:46] I'm skipping
[06:58:48] songs don't hate
[06:58:54] me okay uh I
[06:58:56] mean Gianna ready bench it's not that
[06:58:59] he's bench it's just like like I like
[06:59:01] him it's just I the new character just
[06:59:03] came out you know so we're playing the
[06:59:04] new
[06:59:06] character Jesus man why is everything so
[06:59:14] expensive well there's no time like the
[06:59:16] present we're going to get this to 8 as
[06:59:18] well I
[06:59:22] think what else do I
[06:59:27] need wait what I need something else for
[06:59:29] her
[06:59:33] I
[06:59:35] remember all
[06:59:42] right can you tell another teammate if I
[06:59:44] don't have yinin yeah uninstall sorry
[06:59:47] I'm not sponsor anymore so I could give
[06:59:49] terrible
[06:59:51] advice [ __ ] you sorry no you can um you
[06:59:54] can run anyone with coordinate attacks
[06:59:56] unfortunately there's not that many in
[06:59:57] the game right now I assume there's
[06:59:58] going to be more but um you can run like
[07:00:02] mortify you can
[07:00:04] run technically Yan wo but I think he's
[07:00:07] dog [ __ ] so probably not
[07:00:13] um did my all just miss what the [ __ ]
[07:00:15] just
[07:00:26] happened I need to figure out how her
[07:00:28] Stacks work though I'm going to have to
[07:00:29] test that
[07:00:33] iting Max difficulty for Echo Gathering
[07:00:35] no I'm claiming this one but afterwards
[07:00:36] you're right we could lower difficulty
[07:00:38] right after this which will make it a
[07:00:40] lot
[07:00:46] easier that is a very fair point
[07:01:03] I do not like this boss fight very
[07:01:10] much dude this Echo has literally no
[07:01:13] cast time it's actually insane
[07:01:39] OU jez okay we're
[07:01:48] fine how far is
[07:01:52] this [ __ ] Dragon moves so
[07:01:55] much all right there you go
[07:02:05] all right let's log in it's time to
[07:02:06] [ __ ] grind okay I'm going to check

[07:02:30] piece

[07:12:19] dashing why do you want to St playing an
[07:12:21] actually good
[07:12:22] game cuz I don't want to like start
[07:12:25] playing it when I'm busy and then never
[07:12:26] [ __ ] finish it and then only play it
[07:12:27] for like a day I want to like Marathon
[07:12:29] it
[07:12:37] solic I'm not going to lie though I've
[07:12:39] beaten like okay well I've only fully
[07:12:41] beaten like one Dark Souls game but i'
[07:12:44] I've played a bit of the others and like
[07:12:45] so
[07:12:47] far it's going to sound crazy but the
[07:12:49] hardest game I've played is still
[07:12:50] [ __ ] old school RuneScape and that
[07:12:53] sounds like a crazy statement if you
[07:12:55] don't
[07:12:56] know it's like actually not even close
[07:13:00] like it's like not even remotely
[07:13:16] close I've been playing it
[07:13:29] forever I'm still my Twitter like for
[07:13:32] you page still feeds me like old school
[07:13:34] RuneScape tweets it's pretty funny
[07:13:36] they'll be like they'll make like a
[07:13:37] quality of life change and then like the
[07:13:40] [ __ ] the [ __ ] people you know like
[07:13:43] the like I had to pay for my University
[07:13:47] so so should you I had a house when I
[07:13:50] was 16 like I feel like that's like what
[07:13:52] they say they're like how dare you make
[07:13:54] the game feel new I was playing 20 years
[07:13:59] ago so
[07:14:01] I still see those posts it's pretty it's
[07:14:04] pretty
[07:14:06] funny I
[07:14:23] missed boom
[07:14:48] please please please please please crit
[07:14:50] damage okay if this is good uh I fear
[07:14:54] for my wallet please don't I mean I'm
[07:14:56] fine with it being good at this point
[07:14:57] honestly
[07:14:58] but this is going to be resident skill
[07:15:00] damage I can see the future it's
[07:15:07] HP
[07:15:09] oh attack
[07:15:44] why does yin's uh all do that by the way
[07:15:47] just wondering like I'm not complaining
[07:15:48] about it in fact I'm appreciating it but
[07:15:50] I'm wondering why like what was the
[07:15:51] design philosophy behind
[07:15:59] it wait I didn't get an echo this has to
[07:16:02] be a
[07:16:15] glitch how many booms does waa get on
[07:16:18] the boom meter that's a good
[07:16:21] question boom boom
[07:16:36] we're gotcha guys of course we lose
[07:16:39] every
[07:16:41] 50/50 of course we roll defense percent
[07:17:04] oh I want to play the game get me out of
[07:17:07] this jail just give me crit just give me
[07:17:09] crit
[07:17:10] please please please
[07:17:25] please this is such a waste I
[07:17:29] mean should I just level
[07:17:38] this I
[07:17:57] shouldn't what's wrong with that piece
[07:17:59] everything it's like the stat on it
[07:18:01] aren't bad but it needs double crit and
[07:18:04] like the investment needed just like
[07:18:06] Echo XP is like not worth the
[07:18:09] risk cuz like red it has right now isn't
[07:18:11] good it's tolerable like it'd be good if
[07:18:14] they were the last three stats year old
[07:18:16] but I was like if your first three stats
[07:18:17] are HP ER and ALT damage on a character
[07:18:20] who doesn't really care about alt damage
[07:18:21] that much I mean like her all's good
[07:18:23] don't get me wrong
[07:18:26] but okay
[07:18:35] I think I'm going to put Havoc Rover in
[07:18:38] this
[07:18:43] team is she on my sword
[07:19:06] I
[07:19:23] missed all right we'll check our art

[07:19:27] three and then we'll go all in bust I
[07:19:30] don't want to check every single one I'm
[07:19:31] going to get

[07:20:58] bad and I just don't play it and right
[07:21:00] now I'm enjoying it so it's kind of like
[07:21:03] it's it's a good thing but it's also
[07:21:05] like so many games

[07:25:20] up I won't give up on us okay

[07:25:58] effect uh
[07:26:04] okay that's like
[07:26:15] yeah yeah skill damage bonus is good but
[07:26:17] it's not worth the like
[07:26:19] XP this one also is not worth leveling

[07:26:33] I should not level
[07:26:48] that t
[07:27:10] wait

[07:27:18] kind of get her kid but not like enough
[07:27:20] to explain it okay well enough to
[07:27:23] explain it but not enough to explain it

[07:34:36] hi what's up first time viewer from
[07:34:38] YouTube I'm running a team with alino
[07:34:42] kazua Bennet and zinou when using my
[07:34:46] team should I be using Kazu ha Al or not
[07:34:49] I keep hearing Arguments for both yes
[07:34:51] and no I think both are fine you
[07:34:54] probably don't want to pyro Infuse it
[07:34:56] though like you could sing Cho and then
[07:34:58] Kazo Q
[07:35:00] and then benit burst
[07:35:02] after I usually don't because I don't
[07:35:04] like looking at the animation it just
[07:35:06] feels clunky but like you you can just
[07:35:09] Infuse Hydro if you infuse pyro you're
[07:35:11] going to Vape
[07:35:12] on
[07:35:15] zinq but if your pyro DPS sucks then you
[07:35:17] can run finina Kaza and then your Kaza
[07:35:19] infuses pyro and then your finina does
[07:35:20] more damage than like your duuke
