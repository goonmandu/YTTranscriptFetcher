[00:09:38] kidding I have four anyways welcome to
[00:09:40] the stream uh a lot to do today a lot to
[00:09:42] do today we're gonna be playing gentian
[00:09:44] impact at some point I'll play style I
[00:09:45] don't even [ __ ] know anymore but I
[00:09:47] wanted to stream my Asia account but I
[00:09:48] said I should wait till I have a longer
[00:09:50] stream so we're gonna do Genji today
[00:09:51] then later today technically technically
[00:09:54] it's tomorrow but for me it's later
[00:09:55] today because I'm just gonna nap I'm
[00:09:56] gonna stream again watch party 3.8 then
[00:09:59] I'm gonna stream Final Fantasy that day
[00:10:00] as well because I said I would so I have
[00:10:02] three three streams in the next like 24
[00:10:04] hours so expect a lot of content that's
[00:10:07] the plan
[00:10:08] anyways we're starting with genjin and
[00:10:11] I'm excited uh and 3.8 is looking hype
[00:10:14] assuming from the preview we're getting
[00:10:16] like a new region like a new like area
[00:10:17] that's gonna be cool and then Fontan
[00:10:19] hopefully possibly POG so maybe yeah
[00:10:22] researchers also I recorded a Beto guide
[00:10:25] I'm a bit worried I feel like I talked
[00:10:27] too long I don't want the video to be
[00:10:28] too long
[00:10:29] uh I definitely talked a lot but new
[00:10:32] beta videos coming we have three
[00:10:33] browsers okay so I have my Creator thing
[00:10:36] so I could like see who Subs I have chat
[00:10:38] so I can see chat and then I have Wordle
[00:10:40] which we'll do later
[00:10:43] but like yeah anyways so better videos
[00:10:45] come out the thing with Beto is like
[00:10:46] it's really easy to tell someone how to
[00:10:48] build her it's like just go emblem
[00:10:49] Serpent's fine and shut up but the it's
[00:10:51] kind of complicated when you go into
[00:10:53] like actual weapon rankings when you go
[00:10:54] into how much ER she needs because it's
[00:10:56] either 140 or 160 or 180 or 200 or
[00:10:59] anywhere in between so like it's a bit
[00:11:01] more it's not like it kind of takes long
[00:11:02] but whatever it's all good
[00:11:07] oh it's all coming out now
[00:11:11] so yeah
[00:11:13] also I kind of want to make a video like
[00:11:15] explaining
[00:11:16] why Beto's better than you think but I
[00:11:18] feel like I made that two years ago and
[00:11:19] I don't want to remake it so I might
[00:11:20] make a video of like
[00:11:22] five underused characters at some point
[00:11:24] and included there I don't know
[00:11:28] anyways welcome to the stream oh also
[00:11:33] um
[00:11:35] okay please don't watch this video it's
[00:11:37] embarrassing but I if you didn't see it
[00:11:39] uploaded a video coaching me it's pretty
[00:11:42] funny but please don't watch it it's
[00:11:44] [ __ ] 41 minutes
[00:11:47] anyways so that was something that
[00:11:50] happened oh it was so [ __ ] funny
[00:11:54] um
[00:11:54] I played one game with him it was it was
[00:11:56] unlucky like the dude it was unlucky it
[00:11:59] was a bad matchup they had [ __ ] full
[00:12:00] tank broken Champions that I would that
[00:12:03] were like new to me because I haven't
[00:12:04] played in forever so I didn't know so it
[00:12:06] was like not my fault and then our
[00:12:07] [ __ ] top laner was bad from schools
[00:12:09] literally self-admitted banned from
[00:12:11] schools so you know what type of player
[00:12:12] he was so yeah it is what it is

[00:31:40] Holy that's a [ __ ] minus how much is
[00:31:43] that 25 minus 25
[00:31:45] appreciate it
[00:31:50] MLP things in three months Hey listen to
[00:31:51] Circus album yeah I saved a few of the
[00:31:53] songs
[00:32:04] please help I'll hike them or kokomi I
[00:32:07] have no Hydro 5 star and play ayaka okay
[00:32:09] first of all why using kokomi like do
[00:32:12] you know something that I don't the 3.8
[00:32:13] live stream is tomorrow it hasn't
[00:32:15] happened yet so why are you already
[00:32:17] asking a question uh about a better
[00:32:19] character so do you know something that
[00:32:21] I don't because that would that was
[00:32:22] something that is required for that
[00:32:24] question to make sense with that in mind
[00:32:25] if you play ayako get a five star Hydro
[00:32:29] um but if you want to play I'll hike I'm
[00:32:31] gonna hide them like I think I'll hit
[00:32:32] them is pretty pretty good as a DPS but
[00:32:34] if you already have like ayaka and your
[00:32:36] other team's Chang Ling and you're
[00:32:37] chilling then let's get a support
[00:32:38] supports are pretty good
[00:32:41] also I'm a proud member of kokomi nation
[00:32:46] why does Synchro count as a five-star
[00:32:48] Hydro oh it does think Joe uh yes but
[00:32:50] not for us guys to underscore cat69
[00:32:52] donated three dollars I run clip channel

[00:33:03] oh well
[00:33:05] good I
[00:33:07] this is thanks for the three dollars
[00:33:11] what is your opinion on Chang Ling
[00:33:13] thanks for asking actually shangling is
[00:33:15] the head of the uh is a chef at the WAN
[00:33:18] Min restaurant owned by her father Chef
[00:33:20] Mao Shang Ling is not as a chef
[00:33:22] shangling is not afraid to experiment
[00:33:25] with new flavors and uh uh as alongside
[00:33:29] the stove God guava who accompanies her
[00:33:32] thanks for asking I memorized the start
[00:33:34] of the Wikipedia article
[00:33:36] is it owned by her I don't know I just
[00:33:38] know like some of it
[00:33:43] foreign
[00:33:45] I don't even want to know what jiggling
[00:33:47] is but I'm not adding that emote
[00:33:51] what are your thoughts on Cave
[00:33:55] is the only maybe not the only but
[00:33:59] probably the most noticeable uh uh like
[00:34:03] the most noticeable like
[00:34:09] how do I say this
[00:34:11] the most noticeable
[00:34:14] proponent
[00:34:17] of a unnecessarily small waist look at
[00:34:20] him
[00:34:21] What's Happening Here how how's that
[00:34:23] even also he's a claymore user situation
[00:34:24] day
[00:34:28] hey we're good
[00:34:30] hmm
[00:34:33] also did I misclick my [ __ ] I
[00:34:35] misclicked the second Gadget thing out I
[00:34:37] saw someone in chat yesterday asked why
[00:34:39] does he have two engines and then
[00:34:40] someone replied it's a Creator server
[00:34:42] bro the second gen you wanna know what
[00:34:43] it is look the second dungeon is
[00:34:45] literally it's literally just the
[00:34:46] launcher because if I don't have the SEC
[00:34:48] so this one opens the game directly and
[00:34:50] then this one opens the launcher and if
[00:34:51] I don't have both then my game never
[00:34:52] patches and then I don't patch when
[00:34:54] there's the release day and then I
[00:34:55] forget and then you guys wait while I
[00:34:57] patch
[00:35:00] open it up show me what's inside so
[00:35:03] that's uh that's the meta
[00:35:10] Bob what are your thoughts on Geo do you
[00:35:12] just call me fob
[00:35:17] that's cool I think Jill will get buffed
[00:35:19] when we get the Geo region leeway too
[00:35:22] that's gonna be pretty cool
[00:35:23] I'm excited
[00:35:41] sorry
[00:35:43] so how was your day guys I love
[00:35:45] exploring wow
[00:35:48] yeah but we're basically the reason
[00:35:49] we're in this place is because like you
[00:35:51] guys won't have access to economia for
[00:35:53] like another month or two because it's
[00:35:54] it's like this is like
[00:35:56] um you know I don't want to leak like I
[00:35:57] don't you know we don't talk about leaks
[00:35:58] but this is like a new region you have
[00:36:00] to do a lot to unlock it and most people
[00:36:02] aren't there yet so luckily we have it
[00:36:04] so we're exploring it that's why
[00:36:07] when do you think we'll get a physical
[00:36:08] buff if we ever get a five-star physical
[00:36:09] carry I'm sure they'll be really good
[00:36:12] um hopefully we got a five-star physical
[00:36:14] carry and hopefully we get like a
[00:36:15] five-star like like hopefully when daya
[00:36:17] comes out she she can save virgin too so
[00:36:19] we can have a good physical carry and a
[00:36:21] good burgeon uh okay
[00:36:25] right here
[00:36:30] what about the physical region wait is
[00:36:33] it you guys know wait listen doesn't
[00:36:35] gonorrhea like not worship any Gods so
[00:36:38] either Connery is gonna have like void
[00:36:39] element or whatever like Quantum from
[00:36:41] [ __ ] star rail or it's just gonna be
[00:36:43] physical
[00:36:45] so surely that's the physical buff
[00:36:46] region because they don't care about
[00:36:48] archons
[00:37:00] right here right now
[00:37:04] Alexa for months
[00:37:06] okay why am I doing okay let's go
[00:37:07] somewhere else uh what's the best one to
[00:37:09] explore well I get you guys don't know
[00:37:10] because you don't have this yet but
[00:37:11] hypothetically hypothetically which one
[00:37:13] should we start with what if we do
[00:37:16] unados Locus
[00:37:20] six months
[00:37:25] also I'm gonna eat I'll have this
[00:37:27] we need stamina food
[00:37:34] do I have so much food what the [ __ ]
[00:37:45] oh I didn't [ __ ] feed it yeah
[00:37:48] please be normal
[00:37:50] what
[00:37:51] Chad it's my birthday streamer please be
[00:37:54] normal
[00:37:56] wait when am I not normal
[00:37:58] okay first of all birth but also when am
[00:38:01] I ever not normal
[00:38:24] okay well
[00:38:26] this was a mistake why the [ __ ] did I
[00:38:28] teleport here okay we'll do uh we'll do
[00:38:30] the middle one
[00:38:32] did I just pin something
[00:38:36] foreign
[00:38:39] why do you have 230 Once Upon a Time in
[00:38:43] months doubts oh what the [ __ ] is that
[00:38:45] once upon a time in monstat
[00:38:51] oh these
[00:38:52] no that's delicious pile of mops oh yeah
[00:38:55] because these are the best food for uh
[00:38:57] events and like the event we're about to
[00:38:59] do it this is good and and for like any
[00:39:00] like like a tick tock DPS showcase they
[00:39:03] use this you think they don't you think
[00:39:04] they and then they okay not everyone
[00:39:06] some of them are great people but some
[00:39:07] people will be like what it's the same
[00:39:08] what so you're gonna show a character
[00:39:10] without supports and and without food is
[00:39:13] the same as support characters so use a
[00:39:15] yeah so there's a lot of these being
[00:39:17] used this one and the Chichi one this
[00:39:18] one is the same thing they both give 20
[00:39:20] crit damage and 20 crit rate when
[00:39:21] they're perfected or like specialtied
[00:39:24] so whenever we want to do like a Eula a
[00:39:26] Euler showcase
[00:39:28] what does adapt this temptation give
[00:39:30] base attack and crit rate
[00:39:31] or not be Stacks or just attack like
[00:39:33] flat attack like attack
[00:39:41] go on open why is your shower so bad
[00:39:44] that's bait that's actually bait I'm not
[00:39:46] even gonna I'm not even gonna read that
[00:39:47] I'm gonna pretend I didn't read that
[00:39:48] that's bait that has to be bait
[00:39:54] not only were the best child to be
[00:39:56] stupids we're also top one percent on
[00:39:58] Vermillion despite our luck being
[00:39:59] atrocious and being rank one ayato in
[00:40:02] multiple different categories
[00:40:04] but I'll pretend I didn't read that
[00:40:23] leeway video oh the one they tweeted I
[00:40:25] saw a bit bits and pieces of it you
[00:40:28] could watch it if you want well
[00:40:31] I'm I got my wisdom teeth out
[00:40:34] on me I did a good job
[00:40:36] what why would you what am I your like
[00:40:39] why are you asking me that I
[00:40:42] imagine having to remove your wisdom
[00:40:44] teeth
[00:40:48] yeah I got to keep mine
[00:40:50] brushing them is annoying though
[00:40:52] because you have to like shove your
[00:40:54] toothbrush on your throat but it's fine
[00:40:55] I got used to it
[00:41:13] cool
[00:41:15] well what do we have here well
[00:41:21] bro has a lot of practice okay this is
[00:41:24] entering SAS territories so let's move

[00:41:28] keep your wisdom teeth well you're just
[00:41:29] gonna not brush them that's how you get
[00:41:31] cavities continue to do well you are
[00:41:33] very entertaining that's definitely a
[00:41:35] paid actor though

[00:41:39] that can you can you talk about how
[00:41:40] entertaining I am actually thanks thanks

[00:41:49] expresses what they truly think also why
[00:41:51] am I dropping frames I have nothing open
[00:41:53] I have I guess I have like 50 Google

[00:43:09] [ __ ] is Lo-Fi wait I've never heard

[00:43:18] funny
[00:43:21] wait what the [ __ ] is this

[00:44:00] fontan's out
[00:44:07] um
[00:44:08] yeah
[00:44:10] how do I get through this door do I have
[00:44:11] to change it to night time
[00:44:16] do you guys think when we get Eula and
[00:44:18] arlick you know do you guys think if we
[00:44:20] switch from daylight to night mode it
[00:44:22] changes them like if you're playing Eula
[00:44:24] you turn into our like you know and then
[00:44:25] if you go from night mode to a day you
[00:44:27] turn to EULA
[00:44:29] it's just a reskin right
[00:44:32] I think you could only play them both in
[00:44:34] economia actually
[00:44:37] they're not even similar well even
[00:44:39] they're not even similar
[00:44:40] wait are you kidding wait Eula uh

[00:44:52] bro bro
[00:44:54] bro try to look I like her I think she's
[00:44:57] great and I hope I get to play her but
[00:44:59] tell me this isn't night mode EULA
[00:45:01] tell me this isn't Eula like when it
[00:45:04] turns night mode in enkonomia
[00:45:06] it's literally dark mode Eula that's not
[00:45:08] a bad thing that's just narc modula
[00:45:12] panto this guy pantalone is just dark

[00:47:57] probably a cave
[00:47:58] also I'm actually concerned at the
[00:48:02] at how long it's been since I've been
[00:48:03] able to transform into a cat so we're
[00:48:05] gonna replace Kazo here with cat

[00:48:57] all right well
[00:48:58] easy
[00:49:03] okay show them right now right here dude
[00:49:07] twitch
[00:49:10] twitch do you want to know what twitch
[00:49:12] meta is if you're a big enough streamer
[00:49:13] right now it's having an opinion on
[00:49:15] someone else's decision and then other
[00:49:17] people having an opinion on that opinion
[00:49:19] and then circle jerking opinions of
[00:49:20] other opinions and then that's content
[00:49:22] and then the the drama farmers are like
[00:49:24] going live with big drama today that's
[00:49:27] that's like the meta right now so I'm
[00:49:29] glad I'm glad I play [ __ ] gotcha
[00:49:32] waifu game
[00:49:38] do what you got to do I don't care I'm
[00:49:40] just saying that's like very clearly The
[00:49:42] Meta
[00:49:52] uh we're gonna put Kazo back in just so
[00:49:54] we can fly
[00:49:56] want me to come along
[00:49:59] imagine skipping for casual because they
[00:50:02] said he's like a five-star sucrose when
[00:50:03] that's true imagine
[00:50:05] yeah can your suit girls do that
[00:50:08] Causeway players try not to bring up
[00:50:10] kazu's first Banner challenge impossible
[00:50:13] okay we'll do like left side or right
[00:50:15] side you are King no no no no no no this
[00:50:18] one looks ah so we're gonna be left
[00:50:21] I feel like I'm dropping frames and I
[00:50:23] don't know why
[00:50:25] I gotta fix it though
[00:50:30] how the [ __ ] did I swirl Pyro let me see
[00:50:33] oh maybe it's because I have OBS open
[00:50:44] ayato
[00:50:45] okay yeah I talked about that in my last
[00:50:48] child video so you can watch the iPhone
[00:50:49] more information bye
[00:50:52] generally he's like
[00:50:55] he's like the goat right that's the
[00:50:57] golden but for every other team
[00:51:00] it's like it it can work like child
[00:51:02] unless you're playing like freeze then
[00:51:04] you want like Ramon or something but
[00:51:06] in like let's say like a hyperloom team
[00:51:08] or like virgin or like
[00:51:11] well virgin you could do a shingling you
[00:51:12] do like child changing like
[00:51:13] intergrational or whatever the [ __ ] and
[00:51:15] that's fine but let's say you're playing
[00:51:16] like hyperbloom or like electrocharged
[00:51:18] he's fine like electrocharge is not much
[00:51:21] worse
[00:51:22] uh hyperlum he is worse because his
[00:51:24] rotations aren't as flexible and it's
[00:51:26] like kind of ass unless it's AOE
[00:51:28] and it's just like less uptime no okay
[00:51:30] not less up time but
[00:51:33] well yes less uptime
[00:51:37] um
[00:51:38] but it's not like
[00:51:40] I don't know what I'm trying to say with
[00:51:42] this
[00:51:44] if you're pulling for child for
[00:51:45] shangling I wouldn't pull for ayato just
[00:51:48] because you want to play hyperloom I
[00:51:49] would just use child if that makes sense
[00:51:53] um
[00:51:54] yeah
[00:51:59] into the wind
[00:52:10] but I think I told like I think
[00:52:12] so I think people that only care about
[00:52:14] meta would get more benefit from getting
[00:52:17] child and going child changing but I
[00:52:18] think the average account would get more
[00:52:20] benefit from getting ayato because he's
[00:52:21] more flexible and is usable in like is
[00:52:24] more like it's easier to play but also
[00:52:26] just more like
[00:52:29] um there's more teams where he's like
[00:52:30] the best option
[00:52:36] yeah but also I think child is hotter
[00:52:44] and very satisfying with Riptide
[00:52:55] I'll take okay I've talked about this
[00:52:57] before child is like child is like a
[00:53:00] he's like committed war crimes but he
[00:53:01] gets away with it because he's hot and
[00:53:03] he's caring also he has a heart on his
[00:53:05] glove so that's a that's a dude stop
[00:53:07] [ __ ] moving he has a heart on his
[00:53:09] glove where is it
[00:53:12] he has a heart on his glove and he has
[00:53:14] rizz
[00:53:15] ayato like ayato's like a Dapper
[00:53:16] gentleman but I feel like I feel like
[00:53:19] he's a classist like I don't know how to
[00:53:20] explain it like I like him I think I
[00:53:22] like his like aesthetic but he steps
[00:53:23] Boba too loudly and it pisses me off and
[00:53:25] also he's a little bit of like I feel
[00:53:28] like he's like he'll look down on me if
[00:53:30] I can't like if I can't afford something
[00:53:32] and I don't like that
[00:53:36] um but I also have the rank one ayato so
[00:53:37] no big deal
[00:53:41] foreign
[00:53:54] he does when you open chest so you
[00:53:57] really

[01:08:12] what happens no spoilers because I don't
[01:08:14] actually know but that's probably what
[01:08:15] happens
[01:08:22] [Music]
[01:08:24] all I know is that in my version of the
[01:08:26] game
[01:08:32] all I know is that wait what the [ __ ] is
[01:08:34] your name
[01:08:35] um

[01:08:59] okay let's go to the event
[01:09:02] yeah kazari that's who all right anyways
[01:09:09] do you notice how there's no fatoui or
[01:09:10] humanoid enemies only Abyss aware
[01:09:15] hmm
[01:09:17] that is true as a Lore Master myself and
[01:09:20] a lorehead I actually knew that
[01:09:22] I wonder why
[01:09:26] emerge right now you did aranara but not
[01:09:29] that dude I did when it came out Tina
[01:09:31] Zuma is new
[01:09:33] give me a bit of time

[01:09:39] the first round was on me
[01:09:44] three months on Trio
[01:09:47] three months
[01:09:49] what do you mean three months aren't
[01:09:51] real
[01:09:53] wait okay
[01:10:03] wait where the [ __ ] did the Sealy go I
[01:10:05] looked away for one second
[01:10:10] okay [ __ ] the Celia I guess whatever
[01:10:14] I don't need the Sealy
[01:10:17] oh how the [ __ ] did he get there
[01:10:22] dude how did he get there
[01:10:24] it's okay to admit you procrastinated I
[01:10:26] would never do such a thing
[01:10:28] it's okay to admit that this is a new
[01:10:30] secret region that I have early access
[01:10:32] to
[01:10:37] [Music]
[01:10:47] dude maybe I'm always out of Mora
[01:10:49] because I haven't finished the [ __ ]
[01:10:50] maybe once I finish this [ __ ] I'll have
[01:10:51] so much Mora that I'll be able to level
[01:10:53] 90 all of my [ __ ] characters
[01:11:02] [Music]
[01:11:05] time to go
[01:11:10] how can I build wealth okay why are you
[01:11:14] uh this is listen there's a place and
[01:11:16] time to ask that
[01:11:22] I like the icon of Lucas back on him
[01:11:25] though it's pretty good
[01:11:31] where the [ __ ]
[01:11:39] okay
[01:11:48] bro
[01:11:50] where
[01:11:52] oh on this wait no it's not I
[01:11:56] all right where's that let's now go do
[01:11:58] the new event that we have to do uh and
[01:12:00] I'm sure it'll be great I'm sure it'll
[01:12:02] be fun I'm sure we'll have a good time
[01:12:03] uh let me teleport here first because
[01:12:05] there's something I first and foremost
[01:12:06] want to do
[01:12:08] so let me do that
[01:12:11] when it loads
[01:12:19] oh
[01:12:23] yo sorry I'm setting something up
[01:12:26] Newcastle there's a prime appreciate it
[01:12:29] time to go
[01:12:31] Gamba for event we can
[01:12:35] access things are prime
[01:12:39] okay chat something I kind of want to do
[01:12:43] something I kind of wanted to chat
[01:12:45] is uh okay so I kept my resin uncapped
[01:12:49] the last like three days because
[01:12:50] Instagram for like two or three days I
[01:12:51] unironically spent all my resin on Mora
[01:12:54] on XP books on a gold Talent books why
[01:12:59] gold Town books two reasons one
[01:13:02] buy your talents I want to level them
[01:13:05] and two I want to Crown Beto
[01:13:09] I want to Crown her so I think we should
[01:13:11] do that
[01:13:13] um the only thing is I only have 12 gold
[01:13:14] ones that's not bad that's not not a lot
[01:13:17] however
[01:13:20] I also want to level baiju so what I
[01:13:23] think we should do and bear with me here
[01:13:25] bear with me here bear with me here what
[01:13:26] I think would be a good idea to
[01:13:30] wait is it available today if it's
[01:13:31] available
[01:13:41] all right
[01:13:45] I bought them for a rainy day
[01:13:48] actually they were gifted to me
[01:13:52] Layla Paul chap
[01:13:53] okay well [ __ ] you live up
[01:13:57] I thought you were relatable I am I just
[01:13:59] I have to spend all of my on stream
[01:14:01] resin on artifacts so I can't get Talent
[01:14:03] books with that said we can Crown battle
[01:14:05] if we want should we
[01:14:08] Worth or no chat Worth or no I think
[01:14:11] it's worth
[01:14:18] all right fine the counter
[01:14:22] one yeah it's a lot of [ __ ] Mora but
[01:14:24] hey
[01:14:26] hey we did it there you go [ __ ] most
[01:14:28] broken ability in the game dude you know
[01:14:30] her c2's like a 60 damage increase
[01:14:32] do you [ __ ] know that
[01:14:34] like it kind of depends but dude what
[01:14:36] the [ __ ]
[01:14:37] little so broken
[01:14:46] I thought this guy is a final fantasy
[01:14:48] streamer I will keep playing it
[01:14:50] literally tomorrow
[01:14:52] what about a C6 it's not as much it's
[01:14:55] like
[01:14:56] 15 10.
[01:14:59] but it's about 13 because it also
[01:15:00] reduces electrodes for other characters
[01:15:02] too while Electra res in general so if
[01:15:04] you're playing like Fishel or kaching
[01:15:07] I can give you more
[01:15:10] but still not more than a C2 unless your
[01:15:12] beta sucks unlike your other electric
[01:15:13] characters better
[01:15:16] what do you have 400 resin if you
[01:15:17] weren't there uh DJ Khaled called us
[01:15:19] Midstream and uh yeah give me a resin
[01:15:25] [Music]
[01:15:29] how much attack should Beto have that is
[01:15:30] a false question there is no specific
[01:15:32] number of attack any character should
[01:15:34] have except maybe like ayaka if you have
[01:15:35] too much crit
[01:15:37] crit is better go crit go as much attack
[01:15:39] as you can get and attack Sands that's
[01:15:41] it
[01:15:44] also like there's external attack Buffs
[01:15:46] in a non-aggravate team aggravate teams
[01:15:48] usually don't have attack buffers but if
[01:15:49] you're playing like
[01:15:50] no like a electric charge or something
[01:15:52] you might have Bennett or whatever like
[01:15:53] fiddling tails
[01:15:55] I guess sucrose could run through any
[01:15:56] Tails but you just don't like hakushin
[01:15:57] anyways doesn't matter
[01:16:00] um
[01:16:01] okay let's do our dailies
[01:16:06] yeah attack is better than em yeah well
[01:16:08] so on most here's the thing I explained
[01:16:11] this my Beta guide coming out soon but
[01:16:13] on most aggravate characters yam is
[01:16:15] about as good as attack sometimes better
[01:16:17] sometimes usually similar because most
[01:16:19] electric characters apply a lot of
[01:16:21] Electro and each hit does a decent
[01:16:24] amount of damage but not that much it's
[01:16:25] like a lot of Electro but Beto she her
[01:16:28] skills are really high and it's not like
[01:16:30] the most Electro so attack is better
[01:16:32] because attack Buster scalings whereas
[01:16:34] em Buffs aggravate so it's like if
[01:16:36] you're aggravating a lot em is about as
[01:16:37] good as attack sometimes better
[01:16:39] and if you're doing a ton of damage or
[01:16:41] not aggravating that much then attacks
[01:16:43] better so for beta attacks better for
[01:16:44] yai Miko it's very similar yam can kind
[01:16:47] of pull up ahead because she also has a
[01:16:48] passive that gives her uh extra scaling
[01:16:51] so
[01:16:52] usually like for like yeah you could go
[01:16:54] gilded but for Beto you don't want to go
[01:16:55] gilded you want to go like emblem
[01:17:03] but even if emblem wasn't a thing you'd
[01:17:04] go like you could go like to be stupid
[01:17:06] you wouldn't go for gilded well you can
[01:17:08] go for gilded it's not like bad it's
[01:17:09] just not as good
[01:17:14] or you go like thunder suit there
[01:17:15] thunder thunder suit is pretty good
[01:17:24] yeah official's broken
[01:17:29] so nerd bro I can't okay I have a
[01:17:32] question
[01:17:37] I have a question
[01:17:39] if okay explain I just need someone to
[01:17:41] explain this to me if when I don't know
[01:17:43] something or I make any mistake you guys
[01:17:45] say guide maker by the way LOL W then
[01:17:48] why would I explain something you type
[01:17:50] nerd
[01:17:51] how do I win
[01:17:56] the way you raise your hand is so silly
[01:17:59] what
[01:18:00] how does that even make sense also where
[01:18:02] is this Commission
[01:18:04] foreign
[01:18:11] balls
[01:18:25] good medicine is hard to come by
[01:18:27] what up marouf
[01:18:42] it's also sino's birthday wait is it
[01:18:45] Bulls
[01:18:46] wait is that actually Santa's birthday I
[01:18:48] don't know characters birthdays
[01:18:51] I actually don't like I don't remember
[01:18:53] oh in Asia so tomorrow for us then yeah
[01:18:55] that makes sense
[01:18:57] wait do I have to do the obligatory Sino
[01:19:00] stat tweet on his birthday dude I should
[01:19:02] have done that for you my homie is
[01:19:04] actually insane like people cope and
[01:19:06] joke about it but my Yogi is actually
[01:19:08] insane dude I saw someone okay listen I
[01:19:11] saw someone like malding in a clip
[01:19:13] Channel being like dude I can't believe
[01:19:14] Zach slandered you with me again she's
[01:19:16] actually better than hutau they just
[01:19:17] keep coping against a single boss first
[01:19:20] of all [ __ ] who cares okay
[01:19:22] that's a false narrative who cares about
[01:19:24] one boss enemy and if you have zero AOE
[01:19:27] whatsoever you're not you're not better
[01:19:29] than the character with AOE first of all
[01:19:31] second of all who cares
[01:19:36] sorry
[01:19:39] sorry
[01:19:40] I'm sorry
[01:19:43] I like her though but actually my dude
[01:19:45] my ratio okay listen this is without the
[01:19:48] Plus
[01:19:50] I should probably Ascend her before I
[01:19:51] take a picture but how are you is kazuh
[01:19:54] a big upgrade for child shangling team
[01:19:57] no no it isn't it's more convenient it's
[01:20:00] easier but if you can robots today is
[01:20:03] also my birthday uh sugars can be better
[01:20:05] or about his birthday tomorrow okay just
[01:20:08] International I causes better every day
[01:20:10] because even if sucrose can give you the
[01:20:12] happy birthday every day even if sugars
[01:20:15] can technically give you a bit more
[01:20:16] damage kazua can group better which
[01:20:18] makes child get more Riptide which makes
[01:20:20] it just sometimes better too so yeah
[01:20:23] they're both about as good
[01:20:28] and it's more fun
[01:20:30] uh look at these hundred bits it's my
[01:20:33] birthday every day happy birthday
[01:20:39] anyways that's not the point my point
[01:20:42] was I like your Mia
[01:20:44] also she can use supports that no one
[01:20:46] else uses like yunjin which is pretty
[01:20:47] cool
[01:20:53] or you could change like
[01:20:56] Chad if clay gets a okay if Klee gets a
[01:20:58] rerun should I make a new shangling
[01:20:59] guide be honest
[01:21:02] be honest
[01:21:14] dude why I have never dropped frames
[01:21:17] streaming genshin in my life I'm gonna
[01:21:20] like turn something down just for once
[01:21:21] because I don't know why
[01:21:25] uh what the [ __ ] doesn't matter
[01:21:28] as visual no Shadow quality there you go
[01:21:35] Elgato [ __ ] up your settings dude
[01:21:37] actually
[01:21:40] maybe it's because I no maybe it's

[01:21:44] I don't know something [ __ ] up but
[01:21:50] you play with Bloom on yeah I think it

[01:30:45] that I did buy an SSD I installed it but
[01:30:49] since I dude I installed the SSD and a
[01:30:51] capture card and since then
[01:30:54] I heard a whirring sound and then I I
[01:30:57] updated my drivers and went away and I
[01:31:00] don't know why she's liking it I think
[01:31:01] it's because I didn't restart my PC last
[01:31:02] night I didn't restart my PC like two
[01:31:03] nights so I think that's probably why I
[01:31:06] don't think it's actually my PC is
[01:31:07] faults
[01:31:15] here
[01:31:20] right now okay this one's a lot slower

[01:32:16] best sub stats uh a pretty good flower
[01:32:19] here with some em and some crit a
[01:32:21] feather with a bit of all the stuff that
[01:32:23] we need honestly uh em stands on
[01:32:25] Vermillion Hereafter a good electrical
[01:32:27] with a lot of er which is what we are
[01:32:28] looking for since the Amigo has a 90
[01:32:31] cost burst fun fact the only 90 Cosmos
[01:32:33] in the game so a nice thing to have and
[01:32:36] then uh our um our um our um our um
[01:32:39] circlet is a Vermillion here after
[01:32:41] Credit One with 14K diamond 40 em and
[01:32:43] also some Er oh yeah right in two
[01:32:45] whatever the you got what I mean but
[01:32:47] Ryden basically has like so yeah uh and
[01:32:50] then yeah Miko as you can see uh we have
[01:32:52] a good crit ratio and also 150 ER which
[01:32:54] is enough and 449 em
[01:33:03] okay fair enough you're right but right
[01:33:05] at first you don't feel it because you
[01:33:06] get it back by just jumping
[01:33:09] I'm a side effects
[01:33:19] [ __ ]
[01:33:27] his damn sounds better than attack but
[01:33:28] yeah because it depends but generally it
[01:33:29] is a little bit better but it depends on
[01:33:30] how to go based on yourself that's uh no
[01:33:33] that'll suck you're good
[01:33:35] dude I can't remember the last time I
[01:33:37] did a Vermillion run and I was like yeah

[01:35:02] to prove you wrong we're just playing a
[01:35:04] four fun double Dunder team for
[01:35:05] friendship typically typically typically
[01:35:08] this team would have a a Nemo character
[01:35:10] to swirl Electra like kazua okay that's
[01:35:13] why that is why look I can show you
[01:35:16] I can show you

[01:59:56] flies actually
[02:00:06] I'm so [ __ ] hungry
[02:00:10] all right honestly our resin's uncapped
[02:00:12] while I want to spend more I think it's
[02:00:14] fine if we just go to the event right
[02:00:16] now might as well Feast of The Departed
[02:00:19] Warriors
[02:00:23] you're hungry eat I don't know if I even
[02:00:24] have food
[02:00:41] you must Triumph
[02:00:44] I don't need to read that's fine
[02:00:47] foreign
[02:00:59] I [ __ ] hate this piece of [ __ ] these
[02:01:01] two are I mean this guy's annoying Cube
[02:01:03] but
[02:01:10] wait how much do you need for everything
[02:01:11] 6K
[02:01:14] how much is 6k
[02:01:33] wait pyro res
[02:01:35] cryorez dendro res bro
[02:01:56] yeah maybe Scara but like why Xiao is
[02:01:59] fine but he flies away from showers
[02:02:00] that's annoying
[02:02:02] unless it's not the same as the normal
[02:02:04] Thunderman if
[02:02:12] what
[02:02:16] wait none of these buff plunge damage
[02:02:19] attack and death em normal attack
[02:02:25] this I guess is maybe fine
[02:02:37] wait let me just let me just do
[02:02:38] something let me just sing
[02:02:43] the stream is so early I was late PC I
[02:02:45] was too shocked ball you think what's
[02:02:47] good yeah so later too much ready
[02:02:50] there's a 17.
[02:02:53] is it just like a normal thought about
[02:02:55] it or does it do anything dumb let's see
[02:03:02] seems like an emergency
[02:03:05] mind the side effects oh I can still
[02:03:09] keep going what the [ __ ] was that
[02:03:13] foreign
[02:03:23] yeah this seems annoying with Xiao I'm
[02:03:25] not gonna lie playing Xiao against this
[02:03:27] does not seem fun
[02:03:28] I think we might have to do like uh
[02:03:32] uh big teeth
[02:03:36] if you avoid that first AOE he enrages
[02:03:39] so it really why and where can I find
[02:03:43] your playlists if that's a thing
[02:03:47] there's also just tank it
[02:03:53] picking the turn for the better
[02:04:11] I can still keep going
[02:04:14] mind the side effects
[02:04:16] okay this is fun
[02:04:18] what did I even
[02:04:21] what kills me
[02:04:25] okay anyways we can we can actually do
[02:04:28] this for real but I don't know what the
[02:04:29] [ __ ] kills me okay I think
[02:04:33] um
[02:04:35] is Bijou a good healer yeah he is he is
[02:04:42] um the dot yeah I mean I know but like
[02:04:46] bro okay I think we play Xiao I mean
[02:04:48] maybe I play I could also just not click
[02:04:50] the Denture res one and then play Big
[02:04:51] Tonka T I could do tanari nahida
[02:04:57] like bend it and then whatever the [ __ ]
[02:05:00] like a shield character
[02:05:13] imagine not doing Max score bro there's
[02:05:16] no way we're getting Max score I don't
[02:05:18] think we can
[02:05:20] okay we'll try it we'll try it with like
[02:05:22] a hyper carry Shell let's see how much
[02:05:24] damage we do
[02:05:30] yoemia yalon he has 80 pyro res 80
[02:05:35] percent
[02:05:36] so if you're playing yomiya you're
[02:05:37] probably not clicking that or you're
[02:05:39] brute for oh you might as well just be
[02:05:41] physical
[02:05:48] oh and wait is height no it's not Hydro
[02:05:50] isn't it just uh I don't think it's
[02:05:52] hydraz I think it was dendro cryo pyro
[02:05:55] because I remember thinking
[02:06:08] Chad do I need wrongly or [ __ ] Shields
[02:06:12] don't choose it no I want to try
[02:06:13] choosing everything and if we lose then
[02:06:15] we'll launches it
[02:06:20] [ __ ] Shields all right I'm dead it was
[02:06:22] nice knowing you guys

[02:06:51] you're the healing buff instead all
[02:06:53] right
[02:06:56] wait should we gamble this no right
[02:06:58] surely I just removed one of these
[02:07:11] okay wait attacking defense is good uh
[02:07:15] uh this I guess is good
[02:07:19] is this true damage yet how much is it I
[02:07:21] don't know so it's hard to tell but it
[02:07:23] might be good uh
[02:07:25] skill and burst damage that doesn't
[02:07:27] matter
[02:07:28] moving speed
[02:07:31] like this
[02:07:33] it's one of these two it's either the
[02:07:36] true diameter of Shield
[02:07:46] you know sure
[02:07:53] opponent attack oh it's only 20 I
[02:07:54] thought I said 80. all right okay uh
[02:07:56] Xiao

[02:14:43] fighting against this enemy
[02:14:47] okay maybe we play uh

[02:27:59] all the way
[02:28:05] okay we were close though We're not
[02:28:07] gonna win this but it was close
[02:28:10] wait unless can't wait
[02:28:14] bro hit him
[02:28:19] yo who designed the Thunder
[02:28:21] manifestation what in the yomiya main
[02:28:23] [ __ ] is the thunder manifestation
[02:28:26] okay I actually went over though I
[02:28:28] actually wanna roll actually so winnable
[02:28:30] they were actually dude we're so back
[02:28:32] okay actually sewnable actually sewnable
[02:28:34] actually someoneable
[02:28:36] this is why I wanted the prediction to
[02:28:37] have no time limit because I think we
[02:28:39] can do it
[02:28:41] I'll give it the doubters but I actually
[02:28:43] think we can get AK also our potion to
[02:28:44] wore off midnight
[02:28:48] well I actually think it's winnable
[02:28:49] though I actually think it's horrible
[02:28:53] Envy could do it no he couldn't
[02:28:57] okay
[02:29:04] first it's fine
[02:29:20] let's Light It Up
[02:29:39] Light It Up
[02:29:42] teamwork dude
[02:29:45] why does birds not Dodge it uh
[02:29:50] uh might be winnable still though
[02:29:53] nope I miss particles not winable
[02:29:57] wait maybe one of them I lied
[02:30:04] why is someone asking zaj what team he
[02:30:07] used for it so Jeff complained to me
[02:30:08] that he couldn't get Max Point solo and
[02:30:10] now he's like cat W ring in the chat
[02:30:13] oh so what is it gonna be
[02:30:18] wait can you die
[02:30:23] but the plan was okay we went on that we
[02:30:26] actually would have won that we actually
[02:30:28] dude dude dude whoa whoa what was that
[02:30:35] that was not my fault if I okay if I
[02:30:39] healed on it if I paused the game to use
[02:30:41] food I could have won I think I should
[02:30:42] have [ __ ] paused
[02:30:50] [Music]
[02:30:54] wait did I get marked what is this thing
[02:30:56] on me no it's not a mark okay
[02:30:58] oh hi Mark
[02:31:00] cool
[02:31:06] I [ __ ] stood in it because I forgot
[02:31:09] about burst
[02:31:11] stay in the middle
[02:31:15] hi I'm you here is this a good game Run
[02:31:18] as fast as you can please run run yeah
[02:31:21] it's a good game I really like engine
[02:31:23] impact
[02:31:50] wait do these attacks Mark you too
[02:31:53] oh I guess I knew that but I forgore
[02:31:57] iron face tank this I can face tank this
[02:31:59] I can face like this I can face like
[02:32:00] this
[02:32:05] all attacks Mark you yeah I should have
[02:32:07] dodged that I ran through with the alarm
[02:32:08] like an idiot
[02:32:17] Witnesses
[02:32:39] it's like a bit of delay between my
[02:32:43] rain outlines your face gotcha
[02:32:50] well I didn't dodge in time
[02:32:54] maybe I just time it [ __ ] it I don't
[02:32:55] need to run away
[02:32:57] I'm trying to get 8K I don't know we'll
[02:32:59] see well for this boss I think we can
[02:33:02] why didn't start time
[02:33:04] also why is this retry why does this try
[02:33:07] again reset your cooldown but Abyss
[02:33:09] doesn't look
[02:33:10] so they clearly can design it they're
[02:33:12] clearly actively choosing not to make
[02:33:15] this the case for Abyss
[02:33:26] I thought
[02:33:34] dude I missed my Eon sync show
[02:33:41] s
[02:33:59] the daily
[02:34:10] please get the energy good energy
[02:34:24] [Music]
[02:34:29] dude
[02:34:38] we were one [ __ ] second off
[02:34:44] every one second off
[02:34:51] so close that was good though that was
[02:34:53] good that was good
[02:34:55] whale cat AK listen here [ __ ]
[02:34:58] look I have five star weapons sure but
[02:35:01] it's not like I'm not using c0 I mean
[02:35:03] our four stars aren't but
[02:35:04] [ __ ] you okay it's still hard
[02:35:07] yeah maybe uh maybe sucks no socks won't
[02:35:10] even dude
[02:35:11] actually maybe sorry I don't know
[02:35:14] because saxo is worse like DPS why is
[02:35:16] this worse but
[02:35:18] we're the benediction or ease actually
[02:35:19] do a lot and our Yolanda doesn't really
[02:35:21] have enough VR so like maybe
[02:35:25] okay let me get more potion
[02:35:28] look for
[02:35:30] we have frog back prayed frog
[02:35:38] what am I lagging in monstat the [ __ ]
[02:35:41] pile them up
[02:35:57] Freedom sworn Bennett I could
[02:36:03] oh that's really good
[02:36:10] I could
[02:36:13] cause
[02:36:15] the no attack damage is good the attack
[02:36:17] percent is good
[02:36:19] but
[02:36:23] we have to trigger two reactions we'd
[02:36:25] have to skill and then burst the boss
[02:36:33] I guess we could
[02:36:38] okay chat this time we got it is it this
[02:36:41] one is this one
[02:36:49] hold e
[02:36:57] you join me instead of ayato
[02:37:00] bro
[02:37:02] opponents pyro res increased by 80
[02:37:04] percent you're not there's no way you're
[02:37:07] trying to tell me an 80 pyro resistant
[02:37:09] Thunder manifestation will be weaker to
[02:37:12] yomiya than ayato
[02:37:19] I guess that's why Bennett was doing
[02:37:21] [ __ ] zero damage
[02:37:23] I forgot about that
[02:37:37] let's go
[02:37:51] quieter
[02:37:55] I didn't dodge it I swear I dashed I
[02:37:57] guess it was too late this might be a
[02:38:00] reset already
[02:38:01] I thought that Dodge was like good but I
[02:38:03] guess I wasn't
[02:38:07] Here Comes
[02:38:19] everybody stand back [ __ ] I missed
[02:38:24] up quietly now
[02:38:27] mine today
[02:38:30] maybe you should just dodge you honestly
[02:38:32] I should
[02:38:41] I think we win here
[02:38:43] because now we get birds then we got
[02:38:45] burst
[02:38:46] I have taught you everything
[02:38:49] okay honestly we got we could have won
[02:38:51] but we got marked really early all good
[02:38:53] my bad I think we need more ER though
[02:38:55] but like dude it's so dude it's [ __ ]
[02:38:59] okay maybe next time uh that's fine one
[02:39:01] more one more if we [ __ ] this up we'll
[02:39:02] go more
[02:39:07] Stark
[02:39:11] rain outlines
[02:39:14] quietly now
[02:39:16] no
[02:39:26] body and mouth
[02:39:28] gotcha
[02:39:31] games

[02:40:28] music playing why can't I hear it
[02:40:30] dude how easy that boss is [ __ ]
[02:40:34] annoying but
[02:40:35] that wasn't bad dude that wasn't bad it
[02:40:38] doesn't even take us that long that was
[02:40:40] like 10 tries it's not that bad
[02:40:44] first boss by the way oh
[02:40:48] wait it surely it doesn't get harder
[02:40:49] right
[02:40:57] shot
[02:40:58] second one's the worst uh oh
[02:41:02] wait but what does this one week do
[02:41:04] oh he's resisted a cryo Electro Hydro
[02:41:07] that sounds fun
[02:41:18] second one's easy
[02:41:19] I see
[02:41:29] wait does he is he gonna fly off or is
[02:41:31] that like only if it takes a while
[02:41:47] oh like Overworld
[02:41:52] what
[02:41:54] happened
[02:42:08] I'm sorry
[02:42:11] bro
[02:42:13] damn well
[02:42:15] yeah we could do tanari or I'm gonna
[02:42:17] play shallow too
[02:42:21] but the thing with shows isn't he just
[02:42:23] gonna get a Nemo res and then we're
[02:42:24] [ __ ] what happens once he absorbs the
[02:42:25] Nemo
[02:42:39] hit the weak point what if I oh yeah I
[02:42:42] mean when he flies up though right but
[02:42:44] like he has to fly up first I guess he
[02:42:46] will fly up all right I'm down [ __ ] it
[02:42:52] [ __ ]
[02:43:09] hey plus 15 crit rate
[02:43:33] one more uh a little bit more great
[02:43:35] probably this
[02:43:39] we're low ER but I don't think that
[02:43:41] should matter chat do you honestly think
[02:43:42] we need a shield I don't think we need a
[02:43:43] shield I'm not gonna go cause though I
[02:43:46] mean we probably want like yolan we
[02:43:47] probably want like another form of
[02:43:48] damage
[02:43:55] uh you guys are Pepe laughing okay we
[02:43:56] probably need a shield
[02:44:21] he's been at first to get Empire res
[02:44:23] really actually pyrres from just that
[02:44:25] though
[02:44:28] foreign
[02:44:42] I'm not gonna not hit him though
[02:44:45] unless I don't have child burst I guess
[02:44:47] I could wait where the [ __ ] is Horizon
[02:44:48] is on
[02:44:51] Bennett and then
[02:45:01] wait what is your resistant to how do I
[02:45:03] check
[02:45:06] Electro cryohydros I can't run I could
[02:45:09] oh shanglet tell me why shangling
[02:45:13] is so op she can
[02:45:20] vaporize
[02:45:24] with no ICD
[02:45:32] okay I have to get her though let's try
[02:45:33] it once without gearing let's just try
[02:45:35] one so we have and then we'll gear after
[02:45:37] because my strangling's on Dragon's vein
[02:45:39] and we're not gonna proc reaction so it
[02:45:40] would suck so let's just try and then
[02:45:42] we'll change it after

[02:54:06] ones to get
[02:54:10] I probably don't need defense food
[02:54:12] because I'm a master at dodging but
[02:54:13] might as well

[02:55:22] but then the other two if I could play
[02:55:23] shot was just easy
[02:55:26] the [ __ ] I actually first tried it duh
[02:55:28] dude imagine if there was Gamba dude
[02:55:30] Believers would be like would be

[02:55:33] right now
[02:55:34] that was good
[02:55:40] try it with C6 Channel now dude I
[02:55:42] actually kind of want to
[02:55:43] it would be so sick to just I feel like
[02:55:46] that's like best case scenario for him

[02:55:57] never use it so I'm not like I don't
[02:55:59] know how to use it like I haven't used

[03:00:11] in [ __ ] but
[03:00:13] he'll be back
[03:00:15] play there's no way right
[03:00:19] hey I'll play Drake's or any physical
[03:00:20] resistant
[03:00:24] there's no way
[03:00:30] only possible way to do it Max is EULA
[03:00:32] but like I'm c0
[03:00:35] is it still do you think c0 or yellow no
[03:00:38] way right
[03:00:49] yeah exactly that on my Drake has res
[03:00:52] but like you could probably swap teams
[03:00:53] for that
[03:01:03] holy [ __ ] there's so many characters now
[03:01:16] you okay I'm on the wrong build
[03:01:19] wait why is my Chichi on the right build
[03:01:27] what the [ __ ] my
[03:01:30] oh no she's not
[03:01:46] it might actually be a YULA angle let me
[03:01:49] try something first
[03:02:01] wait what bro
[03:02:03] I want to see how much we do through the
[03:02:05] res I just want to see might as well uh
[03:02:07] We're not gonna play him for the
[03:02:08] Thundering manifestation but I want to
[03:02:10] see where this uh farzan
[03:02:13] Bennett
[03:02:21] I want to see
[03:02:24] I'll see how much our plunges can do
[03:02:31] it
[03:02:32] with me
[03:02:41] 72
[03:02:51] cheer that has to be fine right
[03:02:54] maybe we could like
[03:02:56] still shallow the other bosses
[03:03:00] finally come
[03:03:02] because yeah we have a lot of res shred
[03:03:04] here
[03:03:05] oh we can also play dendro with deepwood
[03:03:07] but deepwood's only 30 deepwood plus
[03:03:10] drawing Lee could be 30 plus 15 right
[03:03:15] 20. I'm stupid well I always forget the
[03:03:17] numbers of everything but anyways
[03:03:21] uh farzan has
[03:03:24] resched as well on um and animal damage
[03:03:27] bonus and res Shred
[03:03:36] I'm not activating C4 Gene bro I'm not
[03:03:39] activating C4 Yin
[03:03:47] wait how much wait how much does Animo
[03:03:49] MC
[03:03:50] yo how much is the Nemo MC again doesn't
[03:03:53] anymore MC have some
[03:04:01] 20 yeah it's kind of cool that's kind of
[03:04:04] ain't no way
[03:04:09] laments
[03:04:12] the other bosses are really good for
[03:04:14] Xiao but
[03:04:15] here I wonder
[03:04:22] like we could do monohydro for this
[03:04:24] again but
[03:04:27] it's this retribution
[03:04:30] oh
[03:04:33] oh my God I just realized something
[03:04:35] oh my god dude you guys don't understand
[03:04:37] the genius you guys don't understand the
[03:04:39] [ __ ] genius right now oh my God I
[03:04:41] just realized something wait
[03:04:48] everyone shut up everyone shut up
[03:04:56] oh
[03:05:05] everyone shut up could be flowers on or
[03:05:08] Xiao but listen no no no shut the [ __ ]
[03:05:10] up listen if the enemy is always Electro
[03:05:14] that means we can swirl guaranteed which
[03:05:17] means we can which means well we reduce
[03:05:19] electras but then we run like Electro
[03:05:23] yeah why'd you let me cook why'd you let
[03:05:25] me cook wow whatever still
[03:05:28] session
[03:05:39] oh yeah we could Thunder suit her true
[03:05:41] but that's still worse than Vermillion
[03:05:44] stabilized
[03:05:47] did you forget he cooked without turning
[03:05:50] on the oven but how much did I do with a
[03:05:53] punch here
[03:05:54] can you [ __ ] land you [ __ ] bozo
[03:05:57] yo I'm not shielded anymore
[03:06:00] don't let me cooked only cook it would
[03:06:03] have been smart if I dealt Electro
[03:06:05] damage if I had like if fish would have
[03:06:07] worked
[03:06:08] yeah well no one talk about that
[03:06:11] so how was your day chat
[03:06:13] how you guys doing
[03:06:28] you are a special one at zox what the
[03:06:31] [ __ ] does that mean [ __ ] you dude I'm
[03:06:33] sorry I think outside of the box

[03:06:41] 10K
[03:06:43] foreign
[03:06:56] for the first one you love for TM
[03:07:00] then we switch to Xiao
[03:07:05] yeah we could also just remove two
[03:07:07] rezzes what's the easy amount of points
[03:07:08] we could we could easily get 13.6 I
[03:07:11] think
[03:07:18] okay I just want to see out of curiosity
[03:07:21] how much
[03:07:24] Eula could possibly do what's the most I
[03:07:26] could do with my EULA
[03:07:41] is there any reaction we could spam
[03:07:43] overload we could spam spread
[03:07:46] but like that doesn't matter if he's
[03:07:48] dangerous
[03:07:49] we could spam
[03:07:51] yeah
[03:07:54] oh
[03:07:56] hear me out

[03:09:19] um but we can use food we can use food
[03:09:21] food gives you 20 crit rate
