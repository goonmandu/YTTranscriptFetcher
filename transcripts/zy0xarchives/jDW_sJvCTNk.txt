[00:08:26] announcement in my
[00:08:27] Discord uh basically asking for an I
[00:08:30] mean I know a few people on Asia server
[00:08:31] I could ask but basically just asking
[00:08:33] for a an account I can use tomorrow on
[00:08:38] Asia release cuz it's second half so
[00:08:39] Asia server gets Emily like 12 hours
[00:08:41] before us so we're going to be testing
[00:08:44] I'm going to stream Emily Asia server
[00:08:46] when it's out and then Emily on my
[00:08:47] account a bit later in the night or like
[00:08:49] the next day um but the reason I'm doing
[00:08:51] an Asia stream sometimes I don't is
[00:08:53] because I like don't I mean okay we can
[00:08:56] talk about it after the characters out
[00:08:58] but like I basically need to to test
[00:08:59] some things for my video so we're going
[00:09:03] to be doing that as usual and I'd rather
[00:09:04] not wait till the na stream to test and
[00:09:06] make a video so I'm going to do it on
[00:09:09] Asia the first two is going to be you
[00:09:10] know we're just going to be playing the
[00:09:11] character teams whatever and then the
[00:09:13] second one will will be uh fooling
[00:09:15] around now uh I post an announcement
[00:09:18] basically asking if anyone has an
[00:09:19] account I could use with like I need
[00:09:21] specific characters like I want to test
[00:09:22] it's a dendro burning character like
[00:09:24] it's not a secret so I'd want characters
[00:09:26] for a few teams I want to try I want to
[00:09:28] see how she works with like nlet or Lino
[00:09:29] like you know some stuff so we'll see um
[00:09:33] that'll probably be the next
[00:09:35] stream
[00:09:37] yeah the views are going to be cooked
[00:09:39] for that vid I don't first of all you
[00:09:40] should know I don't do guides for views
[00:09:42] second of all uh SI it won't it can't be
[00:09:45] worse than sewin so it's all it's only
[00:09:47] up from here okay it's only up from here
[00:09:50] siwin was our last character from now
[00:09:52] hey we're [ __ ] right we're we're

[00:10:03] make a new shanglin video cuz it's been
[00:10:04] two
[00:10:06] years but anyways great stre not what's
[00:10:09] your definition of good artifacts I mean
[00:10:11] it doesn't have to be insane just like I
[00:10:13] want to be able to clear floor 12
[00:10:14] without chat being like wow this
[00:10:16] character is dog [ __ ] like if it's the
[00:10:18] artifacts if the character sucks the
[00:10:19] character sucks but if it's like I don't
[00:10:21] want the artifacts be like terrible you
[00:10:23] know like it has to be like pretty good
[00:10:25] anyways
[00:10:28] um not it doesn't have to be like 40
[00:10:30] crit value but like yeah I don't know
[00:10:32] let me show you an example
[00:10:36] like like okay every single s I'm
[00:10:39] showing you right now is good enough
[00:10:40] even like if it's just one like it
[00:10:42] doesn't have to be like god tier but

[00:10:50] be doing a few things but and apparently
[00:10:52] I just I literally just saw as I went
[00:10:54] live they released Emily teaser so we're
[00:10:56] going to watch that but first we have to
[00:10:58] stall of course we might do a bit of
[00:11:00] simulan today but for the most part what
[00:11:02] we're doing is
[00:11:05] um what the [ __ ] oh yeah after three
[00:11:07] weeklys sorry short-term memory loss
[00:11:10] probably
[00:11:12] allegedly but
[00:11:14] anyways uh and then after Emily we're
[00:11:17] kind of chill until
[00:11:19] notan uh aware but but I'm going to have
[00:11:23] to prep like 50 videos so it might be
[00:11:25] hard to stream as much but I'll still
[00:11:27] try to um

[00:12:41] be known my copyright uh is CLA I'm just
[00:12:44] kidding I don't care but okay tell me
[00:12:46] this won't be the best video you've ever
[00:12:47] seen okay dude dude be honest be honest
[00:12:49] this might be the worst idea but it
[00:12:50] might be the best idea okay cuz there's

[00:12:55] up with cuz everything's already been
[00:12:56] done hear me out hear me out okay we do

[00:13:08] character we put it on a website okay
[00:13:11] then it's they get one V1 and you have
[00:13:12] to you have to basically we go until we
[00:13:14] find the genin character who has the
[00:13:16] most Aura and we just we try to we we
[00:13:19] rank genin characters based on Aura
[00:13:21] thoughts thoughts or no thoughts or no

[00:32:33] after the demo which I think is not
[00:32:35] normal but it's
[00:32:39] okay let's
[00:32:43] watch a perfume can tell you a lot about
[00:32:46] the person wearing
[00:32:48] it mint and fruity Aromas Express a
[00:32:51] yearning for youthful vigor while notes
[00:32:53] of Cedar and Amber show a desire to wait
[00:32:56] what about the perfume that I bought
[00:32:57] that definitely was not for me fragrance
[00:33:00] Fades with dilution evaporation and
[00:33:03] aging so long as you filter out the
[00:33:05] impurities to remove interference the
[00:33:07] perfume will still tell its story holy
[00:33:10] [ __ ] she's Jeremy
[00:33:13] fragrance the top is Citrus and tea
[00:33:15] leaves with nuran roses coming through
[00:33:17] in the middle note and a grounded Woody
[00:33:20] base
[00:33:21] note a very heavy fragrance with great
[00:33:24] longevity rather on the expensive side
[00:33:30] rest in peace wait what perfume can tell
[00:33:34] you a lot even when the wearer can no
[00:33:38] longer speak for
[00:33:40] [Music]
[00:33:42] themselves we'd arranged to go camping

[00:33:56] what do you make of it
[00:33:58] [Music]
[00:34:00] it's unusual to meet at The Summit
[00:34:02] especially for someone who's never been
[00:34:03] mountain climbing before the claim that
[00:34:06] she fell is a
[00:34:08] lie what quite so
[00:34:13] sure did you're a perfume there was no
[00:34:16] sweat among the impurities present and
[00:34:18] no lady in their right mind would apply

[00:34:40] apply such a fragrance who never been
[00:34:42] mountain climbing before the claim that
[00:34:45] she fell is a
[00:34:47] lie oh why so
[00:34:53] sure there was no sweat among the
[00:34:56] impurities present and no lady in their
[00:34:58] right mind would apply such a heavy
[00:35:00] fragrance before a
[00:35:03] climb
[00:35:06] okay she works in forensic dude is it
[00:35:09] forensic just like astrology but for
[00:35:11] detectives like did like what if they
[00:35:14] just put a perfume cuz they weren't
[00:35:15] thinking maybe they wear that every day

[00:50:21] more like obviously you can use them for
[00:50:23] all the content but yeah you get me so I

[02:53:11] person that that's just
[02:53:15] homophobic what the hell I didn't phrase
[02:53:18] what I wanted to say correctly I don't
[02:53:20] have anything against LGBT I just have
[02:53:22] had a few really annoying cases bro what
[02:53:26] the
[02:53:29] huh what the that doesn't even make
[02:53:32] sense um I'm not racist it's just no one
[02:53:35] can tell me I've just had bad
[02:53:47] experiences oh yeah that's weird I don't
[02:53:49] know why I thought it'd be funny I'm
[02:53:51] sorry I can be normal I
[02:53:53] promise
[02:54:00] man okay
[02:54:03] theight okay
[02:54:06] deny is this like every time there's a
[02:54:09] [ __ ] child character I have to go
[02:54:10] through like 20 bands let me guess Siege
[02:54:13] win oh I banned you cuz you were like
[02:54:15] rap is in music and I was like the Ben
[02:54:17] Shapiro's in my chat so I banned you
[02:54:19] honestly you deserve this ban uh but
[02:54:21] like I I can unban you cuz I think the
[02:54:24] rest was fine uh he'll design some
[02:54:27] wonderful clothes for
[02:54:30] you yeah like bro like dies of cringe
[02:54:33] this [ __ ] quote unquote song again turn
[02:54:36] this [ __ ] off dies of cringe calling rap
[02:54:37] music is insane
[02:54:57] you banned him for his opinion okay well
[02:54:58] it's not an opinion like you could be
[02:55:00] like I don't like that but also one
[02:55:02] you're back seating my song twice while
[02:55:04] pinging oh you didn't ping me sorry
[02:55:06] twice which is cringe and annoying and
[02:55:08] then you're
[02:55:09] like it's not an okay it's not an
[02:55:11] opinion if something is if a genre of
[02:55:13] music is music or not I just it just
[02:55:14] felt motivated like it feels I don't
[02:55:16] know how to say this in a a not weird
[02:55:19] way but like it just feels like the type
[02:55:21] of chatter that I
[02:55:24] I it feels racist or it feels like I
[02:55:27] listen to the same one anime soundtrack
[02:55:29] all day every day and like I don't know
[02:55:32] it just feels like you're getting into
[02:55:33] anime Twitter and then anime Twitter is
[02:55:36] a place I don't want to
[02:55:39] be however the rest was fine so I I am
[02:55:42] just disagreeing with the chatter is
[02:55:43] more than this one person this was just
[02:55:45] no back seating
[02:55:48] music
[02:55:49] please was
[02:55:52] we it's up to me to decide who I want to
[02:55:55] be I mean I'll pull it like again I I
[02:55:58] don't care but tell me what to
[02:56:03] do I almost did a prediction [ __ ] it
[02:56:07] prediction will Z respect the poll or
[02:56:15] no it's not weird okay I don't get
[02:56:18] how brain damaged you can be if you're
[02:56:20] like I don't like this genre of music
[02:56:22] that's fine I don't listen to rap I
[02:56:23] don't like rap that's fine if you're
[02:56:25] like it's not music it's just like you
[02:56:28] don't say that about any other genre are
[02:56:29] you like metal isn't music cuz it's
[02:56:31] satanic no you're not like you're not
[02:56:33] [ __ ] 12 like it's just a weird like
[02:56:35] bad faith argument and it's like the
[02:56:38] only person that makes that argument is
[02:56:41] [ __ ] Ben Shapiro and I if he's in my
[02:56:44] chat I won't want him unbanned
[02:56:51] but like again this outside of that this
[02:56:52] person seems fine like I don't think th
[02:56:54] like I'm not saying this is entirely
[02:56:56] their argument I'm just saying that's a
[02:56:58] weird message anyways B on B we'll pull
[02:57:01] it CU I don't really care
[02:57:06] but standing around like this then why
[02:57:09] don't you just model for
[02:57:11] me I don't see it being weird but maybe
[02:57:13] I'm
[02:57:14] cooked okay I I I don't think this chat
[02:57:17] is that bad I think I was just tilted
[02:57:19] cuz they're back seating me but like the
[02:57:21] the argument of I don't
[02:57:25] know like I I don't know is saying a
[02:57:28] genre of music is not music when it's
[02:57:30] clearly music it just gives a
[02:57:32] weird it's just off footing I don't know
[02:57:35] how to explain it
[02:57:55] [Music]
[02:58:05] yeah all
[02:58:06] right how many messages you have 999
[02:58:10] man oh post says
[02:58:14] bad okay this actually cooked cuz I
[02:58:17] usually whenever I ban someone in the
[02:58:19] moment I unban them this might be the
[02:58:23] first like I don't
[02:58:26] even whatever you're in purgatory
[02:58:28] forever again [ __ ] it John oh okay well
[02:58:31] that was
[02:58:34] easy what after getting timed out one
[02:58:38] time for spamming and twice for spam
[02:58:41] begging to be modded and seemingly not
[02:58:43] learning from it we have come to the
[02:58:44] conclusion to ban you have a nice day
[02:58:46] okay I much prefer using my own what the
[02:58:49] [ __ ] I just banned
[02:58:53] someone wait
[02:59:01] what well you probably did
[02:59:05] something I I don't know what you did
[02:59:14] but okay
[02:59:22] I didn't break any rules of the channel
[02:59:24] since I didn't Target any actual living
[02:59:26] individual also no us laws were broken
[02:59:28] so what the [ __ ]
[02:59:31] mods if you really like standing around
[02:59:33] like this then why don't you just model
[02:59:36] for me I'll design some wonderful
[02:59:38] clothes for
[02:59:43] you okay I'm not going to type
[02:59:46] that okay we're denying that okay we're
[02:59:49] denying
[02:59:59] that
[03:00:04] what I mean that's just weird I want to
[03:00:07] apologize about that in my defense it
[03:00:09] was short after net release and I wasn't
[03:00:12] thinking straight but that message was
[03:00:13] not implying anything between him and a
[03:00:14] meline but him and me I don't know if it
[03:00:15] makes it better it was just a stupid
[03:00:17] joke it took me long to this cuz I don't
[03:00:18] know what stupid things I said before
[03:00:19] and I don't want you to read that
[03:00:24] please well now I'm going to read it um
[03:00:55] who says you have to use scissors to cut
[03:00:57] clothes they called BYU mid I didn't see
[03:01:00] that I much prefer using my own cutting
[03:01:02] tools
[03:01:08] Dam their second to last message is a
[03:01:10] slur wait really
[03:01:25] all right yeah we about

[03:08:22] sold at a general store they sell for 70
[03:08:24] MOA whereas they let it like other stuff
[03:08:26] sell for a 100 so uh therefore it is
[03:08:29] optimal to throw
[03:08:31] onions unless the weed is 70 and onions
[03:08:34] are 90 but anyways yeah onions are like
[03:08:36] Worth to buy to sell

[03:10:39] Ling

[03:11:21] gives you up to 64% attack as after
[03:11:23] using your Elemental burst as your HP
[03:11:25] drains therefore attack being a
[03:11:27] universal stat means that it could be
[03:11:28] used on multiple characters in multiple
[03:11:30] teams especially with the release of the
[03:11:32] new character finina who drains your HP
[03:11:34] and Shia who drains his own
