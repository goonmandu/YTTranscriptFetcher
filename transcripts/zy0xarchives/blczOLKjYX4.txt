[00:17:56] at the moment how the express crew has
[00:17:59] given me a lot of food for thought but
[00:18:01] it still when it comes to key plot
[00:18:04] points uh I'm in need of some

[00:18:30] we all think we have infinite

[00:23:51] [Music]
[00:23:55] I'm sick what is that what I have a
[00:23:58] question for Damon um if say there were
[00:24:01] five people would I be one of them
[00:24:06] yeah me neither
[00:24:11] I don't know anything about anything
[00:24:13] okay well I'm pretty sure I'm not one of
[00:24:17] the five people but here is a fact for
[00:24:19] you whenever blade gets scary it's the
[00:24:23] mara flaring up isn't he why does
[00:24:26] Captain always scary ah he usually he
[00:24:31] gets scary I should probably I've got
[00:24:33] that a little blade relies on kafka's
[00:24:36] Spirit whisper to suppress the mara
[00:24:38] inside him yeah that's what I meant to
[00:24:40] say you know most of the time bladies a
[00:24:42] nice quiet no thanks but in the
[00:24:45] bitterness strong Communicator that's
[00:24:47] for sure right yes I'm pretty sure half
[00:24:49] my recording sessions have focused on
[00:24:51] two sounds number one hmm
[00:24:55] number two
[00:24:57] I can believe you literally yeah wait
[00:25:00] till you see that home it's [ __ ] uh
[00:25:02] is that a lone wolf I don't know who's
[00:25:04] more team up with the Stellar Rod
[00:25:06] Hunters
[00:25:08] unless kafka's Spirit whispered him into
[00:25:11] it
[00:25:12] was more of a go-between the real reason
[00:25:15] blade joined was because Elio promised
[00:25:17] him the outcome he desires
[00:25:23] a certain someone on the express has
[00:25:27] been having nightmares about this guy
[00:25:29] not just vengeance
[00:25:32] funeral
[00:25:35] his own to be precise through unexpected
[00:25:38] circumstances blade became Immortal his
[00:25:42] body recovers from the worst of
[00:25:43] sicknesses and the gravest of injuries
[00:25:45] even from Death itself those bandages
[00:25:48] aren't for show for blade immortality
[00:25:51] isn't a blessing it's a curse that
[00:25:53] follows him this is literally shout
[00:25:56] yikes he's cursed to Forever live his
[00:25:59] sins well let's leave the imagination
[00:26:02] here I'm sure he's misunderstood
[00:26:06] Blaze backstory is things unfold for now
[00:26:10] let's take a look at what he's capable
[00:26:11] of on the battlefield
[00:26:13] blade is a win type character following
[00:26:16] the path of Destruction by consuming his
[00:26:19] own HP he's able to deal greater damage
[00:26:22] to enemies like it reminds me of someone
[00:26:25] HP for a win last skill consumes a set
[00:26:29] amount of his own HP and initiates
[00:26:31] Health that's literally well hellscape
[00:26:33] is active blade deals greater damage
[00:26:36] enhanced from Shard sword to Forest
[00:26:39] while Shard sword is a single target
[00:26:41] attack Forest of Swords deals damage to
[00:26:44] multiple enemies I got a question sure
[00:26:47] can blade still use his skill if his HP
[00:26:50] isn't enough to cover the set amount ah
[00:26:53] in that situation when blade uses his
[00:26:56] skill also no disrespect of time on but
[00:26:58] I like his owl more that sounds a little
[00:26:59] dicey a bit well there's a silver lining
[00:27:03] when Blade's HP decreases his talent is
[00:27:05] triggered
[00:27:07] when charges are fully stacked blade
[00:27:10] unleashes a follow-up attack on all
[00:27:12] enemies and recovers a set amount of HP
[00:27:14] okay when blade unleashes his ultimate
[00:27:17] his HP is set to 50 of his max HP and he
[00:27:21] deals Master damage to a single Target
[00:27:23] and adjacent enemies HP for damage huh
[00:27:27] interesting no wonder he's uh so
[00:27:30] indifferent to being healed
[00:27:34] um and the more HP blade loses the more
[00:27:37] damage his ultimate deal yeah it does
[00:27:39] that's hard I mean blades technique
[00:27:41] Karma wind also consumes his HP and
[00:27:44] Deals wind damage to All Enemies after
[00:27:46] entering battle wow
[00:27:50] four characters that want to use a
[00:27:51] technique but only like two cameras
[00:27:54] new Ultimate line anyone
[00:27:58] [Music]
[00:27:59] we can't let blaze steal the show it's
[00:28:03] time to talk about yeah he's who shot
[00:28:05] Stellar run Hunter is partner in crime
[00:28:09] Kafka
[00:28:11] hey again I know you heard me talk about
[00:28:13] blade but I actually was
[00:28:15] I was talking about you
[00:28:18] [Music]
[00:28:24] what was that shot why'd they do that
[00:28:27] [Music]
[00:28:29] wait why is it music
[00:28:32] [Music]
[00:28:35] is this my default music it's a familiar
[00:28:37] face at this point in the store she was
[00:28:40] the first person the Trailblazer set
[00:28:42] eyes on it
[00:28:54] okay I I don't think that's gonna get
[00:28:58] past the editors there Albert um look
[00:29:00] what I am interested in is this since
[00:29:03] Kafka appears
[00:29:09] hijacking signals and draw the crew onto
[00:29:13] the sea and Joe law Foo it almost feels
[00:29:16] like she has the Trailblazers Destiny in
[00:29:18] the palm of her hand it's like Kafka
[00:29:21] said when it comes to Scripps the
[00:29:23] stellaron hunters are seasoned
[00:29:25] professionals well that might be the
[00:29:27] case but
[00:29:30] aren't important and what's a script
[00:29:32] without a director
[00:29:34] um
[00:29:34] read end of the story in your own way
[00:29:39] I've got another question
[00:29:41] what did Kafka join the stellaron
[00:29:44] hunters for me I was actually the leader
[00:29:46] of the stuff Costco was born Ontario's
[00:29:48] five a planet that knows no fear and
[00:29:51] literally Kafka is unable to feel the
[00:29:54] emotion of fear and therefore cannot
[00:29:57] comprehend the value of life when Elio
[00:30:00] promised to bring the joined for me for
[00:30:02] her she signed up without a second
[00:30:04] thought now for someone who can't feel
[00:30:06] fear she's pretty great at making others
[00:30:09] feel it this scares you more than it
[00:30:12] scares me
[00:30:22] so Kafka is a lightning type character
[00:30:25] following the path of nihility and she
[00:30:28] can deal additional image over time to
[00:30:31] enemies skill deals lightning damage to
[00:30:34] multiple targets if an enemy is
[00:30:36] Afflicted with D.O.T they receive an
[00:30:39] additional bout of dot damage that is to
[00:30:43] say if an enemy is already Afflicted
[00:30:45] with D.O.T they receive additional
[00:30:48] damage both during their turn and after
[00:30:51] kafka's attack
[00:30:52] not to mention additional damage doesn't
[00:30:55] replace existing Dot and did you think
[00:31:01] and separately after an ally attack
[00:31:05] a follow-up attack kafka's ultimate on
[00:31:09] the other hand deals lightning damage to
[00:31:12] all enemies with a Chance of shocking
[00:31:15] targets and immediately feeling
[00:31:17] additional damage to those already
[00:31:19] shocked kafka's technique can attack all
[00:31:23] enemies within a set range and deals
[00:31:26] with lightning damage to All Enemies
[00:31:28] after entering battle how elegant well
[00:31:32] she likes elegant things and there's a
[00:31:34] certain Elegance to combat
[00:31:37] guys
[00:31:40] looks her enemies are my flies I don't
[00:31:44] really care about unless she says damage
[00:31:47] until boom boom hey that was pretty good
[00:31:56] yeah from HB sacrifice and maniacs and
[00:32:00] emotionless sociopaths do the coolest
[00:32:04] kid on the Block it's time to introduce
[00:32:07] our next character what hey that is a
[00:32:09] little harsh since when did wealth
[00:32:11] become this is the tallest kid on the
[00:32:13] Block
[00:32:14] think again
[00:32:22] oh come on wait why is my background
[00:32:24] music still playing
[00:32:29] wow hey Luca
[00:32:32] the other choker it's literally Hazel
[00:32:35] wait no it's not he's wait he fists
[00:32:36] enemies
[00:32:45] so that's the guy on the light cone
[00:32:53] is an underworld fighter that goes by
[00:32:56] the moniker Lucas strong arm he's a
[00:33:00] member of wildfire and Apprentice to
[00:33:02] Oleg wait doesn't the underworld have a
[00:33:05] fight club I guess that must be where
[00:33:07] Luca spends his time yeah
[00:33:12] the fight club champion and not only
[00:33:15] that he's also I feel like viable
[00:33:17] operations Consulting we can complain
[00:33:19] about that so he's with the moles huh
[00:33:22] maybe we'll get a skin because no he's a
[00:33:24] member
[00:33:25] probably the kids of the underworld look
[00:33:28] up to Luca in a big way
[00:33:30] and the reason he fights is to set a
[00:33:33] good example of dedication and
[00:33:35] discipline and speaking of fighting
[00:33:38] let's take a look at him in action Luke
[00:33:41] is a physical type character following
[00:33:43] the path of nihility after multiple
[00:33:45] attacks he's able to launch an enhanced
[00:33:48] basic attack his skill deals physical
[00:33:50] damage to a single Target and has a
[00:33:53] chance of inflicting bleed and during
[00:33:55] battle Luca can obtain fighting will
[00:33:58] through a variety of attacks when
[00:34:00] fighting will reaches a certain number
[00:34:01] of stacks Luca's basic attack is
[00:34:04] enhanced his enhanced basic attack deals
[00:34:06] four hits of damage with the final hit
[00:34:09] dealing additional damage to enemies
[00:34:12] lead kids today no respect when Luca
[00:34:16] unleashes his ultimate in addition to
[00:34:18] dealing he also obtains
[00:34:22] the position that targets damage
[00:34:24] received for a set number of turns and
[00:34:28] when your opponent's fists the same size
[00:34:30] your head
[00:34:36] I'm I'm sure having a robotic arm is
[00:34:40] also a big help but I think Luca's
[00:34:42] strength lies in his love of the sport
[00:34:45] oh oh and I almost forgot when using his
[00:34:48] technique during exploration Luca
[00:34:50] obtains fighting will after entering
[00:34:52] battle
[00:34:54] does this guy ever take a break well I
[00:34:57] can't wait to hear Lucas
[00:35:01] next up it looks like we've got two
[00:35:04] brand new five-star light cones coming
[00:35:06] to the warp in version one point I'm
[00:35:08] feeling that let's start I don't care
[00:35:11] instructions [ __ ] my wallet [ __ ] my
[00:35:13] Jades [ __ ] anyone skipping anything
[00:35:16] blade uh question I'm getting a question
[00:35:18] even if it's Dodge Paradise blade
[00:35:20] Dimensions even if it's description is
[00:35:22] [ __ ] you you saw it where he's standing
[00:35:25] right there
[00:35:27] the word Paradise means to you you
[00:35:29] carpet our Baron sword filled Wasteland
[00:35:32] isn't my idea of a vacation yeah
[00:35:36] I don't know each of those swords had an
[00:35:39] owner and blade was the last one to see
[00:35:41] them alive oh whoa so he killed them for
[00:35:45] their swords only a brutal calculated
[00:35:47] Jill is mine could do something like
[00:35:49] that
[00:35:56] [Music]
[00:36:20] what are you looking at me for
[00:36:25] come on nobody eats all right
[00:36:31] the uh first phase of version 1.2 in the
[00:36:34] character warp a lost soul Trail Blazers
[00:36:37] can obtain The Limited five-star
[00:36:39] characters
[00:36:40] they're in the same phase in the like
[00:36:42] okay so Natasha good sushi good if you
[00:36:45] want a player and then the unreachable
[00:36:47] side will be boosted and during the
[00:36:49] second phase of version 1.2 in the
[00:36:51] character warp Nessun Dorma oh
[00:36:53] Trailblazers can obtain election
[00:36:54] five-star character and four star
[00:36:57] character Luca and during this is cool

[00:37:15] Trail blazes it's literally all d.o.d
[00:37:22] is this the same art more blade cap card
[00:37:25] no no no
[00:37:26] I'm trying to save this one sec you see
[00:37:28] my laptop's kind of scuffed
[00:37:31] [Music]
[00:37:38] it's like I'm trying to crop this
[00:37:41] here I won't block the code though
[00:37:44] [Music]
[00:37:57] wait this is a bomb
[00:38:07] [Music]
[00:38:12] if I had met you a few years ago where
[00:38:14] is this playing from
[00:38:16] more interesting turn
[00:38:18] you know I heard you had something new
[00:38:22] in the works was it about let me guess
[00:38:25] us battle they will need to pass through
[00:38:28] various deaths yo no surprise then at
[00:38:30] the moment oh I have a chrome Tower two
[00:38:33] new areas
[00:38:36] scale Gorge waterscape now the Albany
[00:38:40] commission is
[00:38:43] cool you got it the Alchemy commission
[00:38:47] is one of the six commissions of the
[00:38:49] lafoo and for no prize whatsoever can
[00:38:53] anyone name all six oh yeah let's say
[00:38:56] the Alchemy commission the Divination

[00:39:16] immortality but these days it's all
[00:39:20] about medical research and treating
[00:39:22] diseases
[00:39:23] came face to face with some alchemy
[00:39:26] commission folks in exalting sanctum but
[00:39:28] things seemed a little off I don't want
[00:39:31] to create more work for the editors but
[00:39:34] I have a theory that the reason to the
[00:39:37] Alchemy commission last scale Gorge
[00:39:40] waterscape the realm of the video is
[00:39:43] just ignoring us now we've got a lot to
[00:39:46] get through where was I oh along with
[00:39:50] the Alchemy commission and scale Gorge
[00:39:52] waterscape come new water oh my God it's
[00:39:56] Funtime Trailblazers will face a lot of
[00:39:58] new challenges on the road to the
[00:40:00] ambrosial arbor I can't wait
[00:40:03] are you making Corey read off the
[00:40:06] teleprompter well it's actually cool
[00:40:07] though are the only new challenges
[00:40:09] Trailblazers will be facing in these
[00:40:11] areas
[00:40:13] ah first up another Megan blade video by
[00:40:16] the formidable size wait that's sick
[00:40:18] what the [ __ ] the malefic ape the big
[00:40:22] monkey an entity rid of the burden of
[00:40:25] humanity actually no that has the model
[00:40:27] itself in the way of immortality I will
[00:40:31] not succumb and finally Yen Chang wait
[00:40:33] what why would the General's aides
[00:40:35] attack a cloud night lieutenant
[00:40:37] all will be revealed
[00:40:39] story
[00:40:42] I I think we skipped an enemy Alberta
[00:40:47] mode is literally me are you guys
[00:40:49] killing me oh how could I forget
[00:40:56] oh my god dude who is she
[00:41:00] dude who is
[00:41:02] okay there's no way they made you attack
[00:41:05] her listen listen why do you attack her
[00:41:08] chest listen
[00:41:11] bro
[00:41:16] bro how is that the boss fight oh
[00:41:20] did you change his colors
[00:41:24] find your hats folks it's fantilia the
[00:41:26] undying
[00:41:28] the destruction and the abundance in the
[00:41:32] first phase she suffers which restore
[00:41:36] her HP and reduce the plan yeah what's
[00:41:39] her eye color points weakening her
[00:41:41] enemies and strengthening herself in one
[00:41:43] Fell Swoop yikes that's why choosing the
[00:41:46] right moment to destroy those abundance
[00:41:48] lotuses is so important eliminating an
[00:41:51] abundance Lotus recovers three skill
[00:41:53] points
[00:41:54] gotta give it back now in her second
[00:41:58] phase bantilia uses her destruction
[00:42:01] power to summon destruction Lotus
[00:42:03] reduce Ally Max HP and when In Bloom
[00:42:07] deal damage like lore wise wouldn't you
[00:42:09] just like explode just wait for them to
[00:42:12] stop blooming before we take them out no
[00:42:14] I doubt the power of the destruction is
[00:42:17] as simple as that oh you're not wrong
[00:42:20] Cheryl when the lotuses aren't In Bloom
[00:42:22] their toughness doesn't receive damage
[00:42:24] as such Trailblazers should seize the
[00:42:27] moment when the flowers are open to
[00:42:29] break their weakness and finally in the
[00:42:32] third phase fantilia goes golden hmm
[00:42:35] what terrible trick does she have up her
[00:42:37] sleeve whoa I'm afraid Trailblazers are
[00:42:40] gonna have to wait to find out
[00:42:42] I'm curious where did fantilia even come
[00:42:45] from how come she can use the powers of
[00:42:48] the abundance and the destruction I hate
[00:42:52] to be that guy the wealth actually
[00:42:53] sounds like me like I'm Not A coping
[00:42:55] anymore rebuilding the version 1.2 star
[00:42:58] if anyone here getting Deja Vu hey I
[00:43:02] can't go spilled all the beans when the

[00:43:43] not mistaken it's time to talk about
[00:43:44] version 1.2 events I've been waiting for

[00:43:52] the Fantastic the crisis on the
[00:43:54] siangular food I'm fantastic Pizza the
[00:43:57] nameless can be heard on every street
[00:43:59] what is this look at that house
[00:44:01] starstriff Haven Storyteller Mr Syed is
[00:44:04] interested in the astral Express's tail
[00:44:06] eager yeah
[00:44:09] Storyteller I'm familiar with him I
[00:44:12] wonder what he'll do with the
[00:44:14] Trailblazers story is his artistic
[00:44:16] license and collage editing bring all
[00:44:20] kinds of tales to life well that's Mr
[00:44:22] Sienna all right to spruce up the tail
[00:44:24] he's given us a set of protagonist
[00:44:27] models protagonist models what's that I
[00:44:30] hear it's kind of a magical objected by
[00:44:33] one of the script writers at the
[00:44:35] immersion Club it industrializes the
[00:44:37] scriptwriting process
[00:44:42] storytelling to unleash the full
[00:44:44] potential of the protagonist models the
[00:44:46] Trailblazer must company Mr suyen into
[00:44:49] the past and visit historical battle
[00:44:52] locations now the name might be a little
[00:44:56] dull yo okay this guy I know he's gonna
[00:44:59] say he doesn't look like me this guy

[00:45:10] this sounds like a fun event well
[00:45:13] there's more with that kid the next
[00:45:16] event unless he's gonna talk about the
[00:45:17] guy bottom left yeah maybe underworld
[00:45:19] appraiser maybe blow away the miners
[00:45:21] lamp is making oh we got a customizable
[00:45:23] religion
[00:45:26] discovered where many rare treasures and
[00:45:29] Relics are waiting to be identified
[00:45:30] however according to the senior treasure
[00:45:33] hunter aksei there exists a space
[00:45:36] beneath the ruins where relics have even
[00:45:38] greater value may be found the only
[00:45:40] thing is the road to the ruined depths
[00:45:42] is filled with all kinds of danger
[00:45:45] treasure hunt speaking of danger blades
[00:45:47] and explore sealed areas in order to
[00:45:50] progress oh I didn't do the new event
[00:45:51] ruins
[00:45:54] are full of Hidden Treasures but uh
[00:45:56] there's always a catch the danger rolled
[00:46:00] into one I'm sure
[00:46:02] treasure hunters will need endurance
[00:46:05] courage and insight if they want to
[00:46:07] succeed it's almost certain that the
[00:46:10] Seward areas will contain enemies but
[00:46:12] but supplementary items and key cards to
[00:46:15] other sealed areas are the secrets to
[00:46:17] progression this is a solo mission right
[00:46:20] it sounds like a tough challenge to take
[00:46:22] on a loan
[00:46:25] during exploration treasure Hunters can
[00:46:28] boost
[00:46:30] let's hope that we're happy to see it I
[00:46:33] can't do this
[00:46:34] get any kind of special rewards ah of
[00:46:38] course in the underground treasure hunt
[00:46:40] event aside from the usual Stella Jade
[00:46:43] treasure Hunters can obtain the themed
[00:46:45] where's the rabbit chat box ah isn't the
[00:46:49] rabbit in the chat box oh a chat box

[00:47:08] so cool Trailblazers and swap a twin
[00:47:12] chat box and I'm not just talking about

[00:47:36] Trailblazers will be able to view and
[00:47:38] swap between those they already have as
[00:47:41] well as bro I'm not using that okay but
[00:47:43] it sets the precedent what if the next
[00:47:44] one is literally your writing
[00:47:47] mystery respectfully this really is the
[00:47:49] version of a trusting creatures isn't it
[00:47:51] the good news is all of them can be

[00:48:13] to fight it I mean sure it's a little
[00:48:14] scary but it's cute right uh if I've
[00:48:17] been over this again free to play
[00:48:19] players don't care if it's cute they
[00:48:20] would literally murdered innocent

[00:51:27] Temple and then on the first day I got
[00:51:28] one single pull and I did a single pull
[00:51:30] and then we both know how that went
[00:51:37] but for the other ones we also got
[00:51:38] Temple so
[00:51:40] yeah
[00:51:40] [Music]

[00:52:01] time flies when you're having fun I know
[00:52:05] that's best of a program let's come to
[00:52:07] an end we talked about a lot of 1.2
[00:52:10] features you guys got any favorites damn
[00:52:13] gotta be that boss fight for me uh when
[00:52:15] the crew fought the Doomsday beast and
[00:52:18] cocolia welt was watching from the
[00:52:20] sidelines this will be the first time we
[00:52:22] see him on the battlefield so watch your
[00:52:26] back fan till yeah I'm excited to see
[00:52:29] more of Blade heck I recorded enough
[00:52:32] fighting efforts to lay down 1.2 will
[00:52:33] probably be the best
[00:52:37] passion it seems like him and Don hunger
[00:52:39] are finally about to meet something
[00:52:41] tells me either I'm gonna settle things
[00:52:43] over a cup of tea
[00:52:46] as for me it is all about Kafka although
[00:52:49] I am curious about the tales of the
[00:52:51] Fantastic event because it sounds like
[00:52:53] Trailblazers have plenty of room to get
[00:52:55] creative seems like we're all a little
[00:52:58] biased here but one thing is for sure
[00:53:01] 1.2 is a version to look forward to
[00:53:04] Alberts here has done a good job keeping
[00:53:07] us in check today you know and there's
[00:53:10] still a lot of money who's Albert for
[00:53:11] you Trailblazers to delve into
[00:53:23] thanks again to all you Trailblazers for
[00:53:25] tuning in and see you wait is there no
[00:53:28] like what
[00:53:32] wait there has to be more
[00:53:36] there's a usually at the end they show
[00:53:41] the interest 12 piece Corporation has
[00:53:43] just declared the latest Galactic bounty
[00:53:45] hunt calling for the capture of the
[00:53:47] Celeron Hunters according to reliable
[00:53:49] sources Kafka and blade are expected to
[00:53:51] appear at the upcoming Cosmic
[00:53:53] refreshment supplies which poses a high
[00:53:55] risk of Destruction we urge the public
[00:53:57] to remain Vigilant we'll announce the
[00:54:00] whereabouts of the Outlaws
[00:54:07] well she's out of this well I missed it
[00:54:12] I missed a screenshot killing myself
[00:54:18] but that was cool
[00:54:20] all right
[00:54:22] like the video sign in to make your
[00:54:24] opinion count okay oh
[00:54:28] yo that was sick what the hell I mean I
[00:54:30] kind of knew what to expect but
[00:54:33] yeah that looked cool I just can't
[00:54:35] really scream here I don't want to wake
[00:54:36] everyone up but that was pretty hype
[00:54:38] wait someone link yo someone linked the
[00:54:40] new sets I want to look at them because
[00:54:41] they looked actually pretty good
[00:54:43] dude shut the [ __ ]
[00:54:46] sound like the new sets does that have a
[00:54:48] clip of it or a screenshot of it let me
[00:54:50] open Twitter
[00:54:59] um
[00:55:01] I found them
[00:55:06] you can scroll back on YouTube
[00:55:08] the simulated you know I forgot okay yo
[00:55:12] sorry sorry world seven looks really
[00:55:15] cool world seven looks really cool uh we
[00:55:17] got so okay let's start with the world
[00:55:19] seven sets so okay okay okay so okay
[00:55:23] okay okay okay so okay retilient Arena
[00:55:27] increase the wireless crude rate we
[00:55:29] obviously don't know the numbers right
[00:55:30] but create
[00:55:32] and then you gain basic attack and skill
[00:55:34] damage so that's good for certain
[00:55:35] characters that like spam like you know
[00:55:37] skill and stuff okay pretty good then
[00:55:39] broken Keel yeah effect res and the
[00:55:41] effect res is converted to crit damage
[00:55:43] for all allies that hey if I've ever
[00:55:45] heard of a Healer set this is the herd
[00:55:47] that I heard that's pretty good
[00:55:49] especially if you play brania
[00:55:52] now what is this long disciple
[00:55:56] well how do you pronounce that word
[00:55:57] that's not even French
[00:55:59] whatever increase Max HP when the wearer
[00:56:01] is hit or okay that's blade when there
[00:56:03] was hit or their HP is consumed by an
[00:56:06] ally their crit rate increases by a
[00:56:08] certain number of turns oh for us or
[00:56:11] number of turns this effect is stackable
[00:56:13] okay yeah that's literally that's
[00:56:14] literally Vermillion but for it's
[00:56:16] Vermillion but for blade
[00:56:18] it's literally blade Vermilion
[00:56:22] yeah I hate this not again oh yeah
[00:56:24] Ireland too apparently I I genuinely
[00:56:27] don't know Arlen's abilities but uh yeah
[00:56:29] if the destruction are the surely surely
[00:56:31] that's what he does and then the other
[00:56:33] one is Messenger travels hackerspace
[00:56:34] increases speed window yeah I don't know
[00:56:36] why it doesn't show how much speed
[00:56:38] it's probably like
[00:56:41] wait how much attack do you get from
[00:56:42] [ __ ]
[00:56:44] likes
[00:56:46] whatever I mean again it's 18 but wait
[00:56:49] let me pull up stereo I'll launch it
[00:56:51] later anyways speed when the wire uses
[00:56:53] their ultimate on Ally speed for all has
[00:56:55] increased for a certain number of turns
[00:57:01] six for yeah it might be six
[00:57:04] ten there is no way the two piece gives
[00:57:06] you ten that would be stupid broken
[00:57:09] if the two piece gives you 10 it would
[00:57:11] be [ __ ] insane it's probably like six or
[00:57:13] something
[00:57:17] yeah cause musketeer gives you six
[00:57:23] you know even six is a lot because the
[00:57:24] subset is what like two like one to two
[00:57:30] yeah it could be four it could have
[00:57:32] ironically before like I don't think it
[00:57:33] yeah anyways and then the four piece
[00:57:35] when the word using an ultimate on Ally
[00:57:37] so a support
[00:57:39] or some other characters but yeah speed
[00:57:41] for All Eyes increase for a certain
[00:57:43] number of turns oh yeah this is like
[00:57:45] Ting Yoon this is brania
[00:57:48] this is Maybe
[00:57:50] yeah there's like any support that's
[00:57:52] pretty sick cool finally got a support
[00:57:54] set no more [ __ ] musketeer hell yeah
[00:57:56] brother
[00:57:57] messaging traversing hackerspace it kind
[00:58:00] of looks ugly but the left one the
[00:58:02] Vermilion looks good
[00:58:06] yeah that's the two
[00:58:07] then you get so much dude you get so
[00:58:09] much speed
[00:58:14] someone typed Slifer wolf dude does
[00:58:17] silver wolf use an ultimate on an ally
[00:58:29] foreign
[00:58:56] question this is a solo mission right it
[00:59:00] sounds like a tough chat
[00:59:02] start to explore some water please and
[00:59:05] we didn't see the lycom stats right
[00:59:07] why aren't they showing the numbers
[00:59:08] sausage I mean okay they never show the
[00:59:11] like weapons and like the gun streams
[00:59:12] either but usually they show the
[00:59:14] artifact or like Relic that's
[00:59:20] all good I guess
[00:59:22] that was pretty sick
[00:59:23] I'm hype I was like super hyped for
[00:59:25] Dungeon I still am but now I'm also
[00:59:27] having to start real and I hate it
[00:59:28] because now I'm like for two games but
[00:59:30] I'll probably
[00:59:31] um
[00:59:32] grind 1.2 and then grind font 10 in that
[00:59:34] order we'll see though
[00:59:38] I'm gonna watch the Fontan trailer when
[00:59:40] I'm home because I want to be able to
[00:59:41] actually be loud
[00:59:43] I'd feel bad if I were allowed here
[00:59:45] so I'm I still haven't watched all of it
[00:59:50] like I still only skim through it on
[00:59:52] mute to see the characters
[00:59:59] new ornaments we looked at them they're
[01:00:02] pretty good the crittery one could be
[01:00:03] good we don't know the numbers but if
[01:00:05] inert South Soto is good because like
[01:00:06] ultimate damage and follow up
[01:00:08] I assume for basic attack or like skill
[01:00:10] characters
[01:00:11] the nuclear one could be good and then
[01:00:13] the crew damage one is just good
[01:00:15] for supports
[01:00:17] or healers because it's a factor as I
[01:00:20] don't know what the [ __ ] way is here
[01:00:21] right
[01:00:22] I'm hyped to do world seven though
[01:00:30] wait is that true yo chat chat okay
[01:00:33] according to the the numbers we know
[01:00:34] right like if all goes according to
[01:00:37] standard Banner schedule

[01:00:46] like eat my I will oh dude I'll be so
[01:00:49] pissed surely that's not true right
[01:00:51] surely that's not true that can't be
[01:00:53] true that actually can be
[01:00:56] no no no I'm not actually gonna be true
[01:00:59] that actually can't be
[01:01:03] they have to overlap at some point no
[01:01:05] but it's [ __ ] Fontan surely it's like
[01:01:07] uh yeah surely it's like a week off
[01:01:10] I didn't calculate I don't know it's in

[01:08:35] is this a joke
[01:08:38] wait Chad did you guys I can't scream
[01:08:41] did you guys watch
[01:08:43] uh this video what do you think good or
[01:08:45] no because we're testing some I'm like
[01:08:48] Soul trialing editors and stuff so I
[01:08:50] want to see how like people like it so
[01:08:52] yeah
[01:08:54] I decided to do free to play account
[01:08:56] reviews watch it
[01:08:59] 1003 wait what did I miss I don't know
[01:09:01] how to go back on
[01:09:06] feel as good as usual okay let's get to
[01:09:08] here
[01:09:09] oh yeah also I did this where I wrote a
[01:09:11] giant ass note because okay it's like a
[01:09:13] funny like stream highlight video so no
[01:09:15] one really cares but I was like on the
[01:09:17] off chance because like I also give
[01:09:18] advice to people so like I kind of want
[01:09:20] to add a note explaining why I said what
[01:09:22] I said so I added that because like
[01:09:24] their team was very like specific and I
[01:09:27] was like yo just in case other people
[01:09:28] want to play hyperbloom Maybe
[01:09:31] don't use beta as your only Electro so I
[01:09:34] was like kind of trying to show that but
[01:09:35] yeah
[01:09:36] anyways
[01:09:38] essaying dude it was a [ __ ] it was
[01:09:41] just a bonus
[01:09:45] that should have been Electro MC no
[01:09:46] you're dumb
[01:09:47] o and Central's damage are so high that
[01:09:49] you make up for any loss reactions it
[01:09:51] doesn't matter it legit does not matter
[01:09:52] but like the point was usually you'd go
[01:09:55] I'll hide them Beto and then just
[01:09:56] Quicken if you don't have a good Hydro
[01:10:02] but
[01:10:04] foreign
[01:10:07] this account had no official no cookie
[01:10:10] no Bennett
[01:10:15] and they didn't want to use sucrose
[01:10:23] why not level Lisa I did say they use
[01:10:25] Lisa
[01:10:26] but if you use Lisa in the other like
[01:10:28] both teams needed Electro and they
[01:10:30] didn't have electric look dude look at
[01:10:31] their [ __ ] team and they don't want
[01:10:32] to play sucrose I remember asking look
[01:10:34] look at their teams
[01:10:36] yeah I mean like this is an example of
[01:10:38] like if you play some gross but look
[01:10:52] like I'm sure there's like one person
[01:10:54] who did an official or a cookie wait
[01:10:57] yeah look look look look at their
[01:10:59] Electro characters Beto Lisa Sara
[01:11:03] that's it and you can't use even okay
[01:11:05] not only is Electro MC copium but also
[01:11:07] you want to use dendro MC because they
[01:11:09] didn't have dendro characters either
[01:11:09] well I guess that but yeah they don't
[01:11:11] have many so it's like literally like
[01:11:13] you kind of have to just if you want a
[01:11:15] hyperl you have to Beto with sucrose and
[01:11:18] if or at least on field but that's kind
[01:11:19] of yeah
[01:11:22] uh oh you remember at the start of the
[01:11:25] stream when I was like I'm sure there's
[01:11:26] like one let me change this to gentian

[01:25:15] actually based uh just go like I like
[01:25:18] reminiscence Barbara because use your
[01:25:19] skill and then Buster attacks but that's
[01:25:21] more for burst damage if you want
[01:25:22] consistent damage you could you could do
[01:25:24] wander for charge attacks uh wanders but
[01:25:26] that's more for melt uh for
[01:25:28] electrocharge there's other sets you can
[01:25:30] go
[01:25:31] um just like normal attacking sets right
[01:25:33] so it kind of depends what you want uh
[01:25:35] uh uh I would recommend
[01:25:37] going based on your stats uh go climb no
[01:25:40] you are not going clam because you're
[01:25:42] not healing you're going full damage
[01:25:43] you're going attack Sans you're going
[01:25:46] Hydro gobble it and you're going crit
[01:25:48] circling you're going with Sith and you
[01:25:50] can go reminiscence if you want uh or
[01:25:52] Echoes yeah true Echoes can work but the
[01:25:55] problem with Echoes is you have to farm
[01:25:56] Echoes and and two is that you also want
[01:25:58] to charge attack on Barbara her charge
[01:25:59] tax are good
[01:26:16] also mention you're not that tall okay
[01:26:18] look at this
[01:26:26] twice as height
[01:26:29] I don't know I have this
[01:26:40] I gave a second chance to shangling
[01:26:46] [Music]

[01:27:42] resin that was donated to me by a prime
[01:27:44] minister of a country which we'll talk
[01:27:46] about later I also have I didn't do the
[01:27:48] abyss I'm still at floor eight
[01:27:51] I'm still at floor eight
[01:27:53] so that's three things I also need to
[01:27:55] explore the 3.8 event and get Kaya's
[01:27:58] skin that's four I need to play my free
[01:28:00] to play account until Fontan comes out

[01:28:17] [ __ ] the freedom account no seriously I
[01:28:19] wanna have it ready for fonten though
[01:28:21] because it's Asia so I can do a business
[01:28:22] when it comes out
[01:28:23] and I have about a hundred fragile resin
[01:28:26] on it which means imagine the content if
[01:28:29] I can waste two accounts resin on
[01:28:32] Vermilion think about that
[01:28:34] think about that
[01:28:35] Zion Ox wastes another account resin
[01:28:38] xyox makes a free-to-play count and goes
[01:28:41] to Vermillion think about that think
[01:28:43] about the content
[01:28:45] you know
[01:28:48] think about the content
