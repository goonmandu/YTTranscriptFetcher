[00:19:22] doing it so I don't know when I'm going
[00:19:23] to do
[00:19:24] it every course of action has its risks
[00:19:31] careful H story Quest yeah what about

[00:20:08] maybe but I'm
[00:20:10] not
[00:20:13] sorry I didn't do kokomi story Quest
[00:20:16] because they apparently from what I know
[00:20:17] they ruin her and she's just like sing
[00:20:19] for the traveler instead of being a cool
[00:20:21] General so I have my own kakomi lore in
[00:20:24] my
[00:20:27] head
[00:20:34] I like K Quest I mean I can't judge it I
[00:20:36] didn't do it so I can't judge
[00:20:38] it I like all of Shia stories though
[00:20:41] Shia's archon Quest goed goated
[00:20:48] goed bro hates the traveler has Charisma
[00:20:51] first of all don't say Charisma like
[00:20:53] that second of all the traveler is a
[00:20:55] dumb [ __ ] who doesn't even use words no
[00:20:56] disrespect but the Traveler's like m M
[00:20:59] they're just they're just [ __ ]
[00:21:00] carried by the fact that they're broken
[00:21:02] and like a Divine unknown [ __ ] being
[00:21:04] who came down to [ __ ] Reign their
[00:21:06] Divine semen on everyone cuz they're a
[00:21:08] [ __ ] like oh I'm so strong but
[00:21:10] there's like they literally say nothing
[00:21:11] and everyone's like oh my God I love you
[00:21:13] that's it that's that's ganton impact
[00:21:15] play free
[00:21:16] today sorry no disrespect to traveler I
[00:21:19] like line Line's
[00:21:22] cool I just personally like it when main
[00:21:25] characters have a personality instead of
[00:21:27] like um uh a self-insert that's my
[00:21:30] personal preference You can disagree
[00:21:32] that's good for you oh cave fren of
[00:21:41] 10 okay chat if Cav's on the next Banner
[00:21:44] then you guys all know that it was

[00:21:47] with me and now he's he's ready to come
[00:21:49] back to genin if he's on the next Banner
[00:21:52] this is a if he's on the next Banner
[00:21:53] right now it's chori uh yeah
[00:21:57] so
[00:22:01] where's my
[00:22:04] key not again is Al heyen better than
[00:22:07] chanun what what what dude D dude dude
[00:22:09] dude dude dude is a fork better than a
[00:22:10] spoon is a fork better than a spoon what
[00:22:12] the [ __ ] are you asking
[00:22:14] me what the [ __ ] are you asking me it's
[00:22:18] it's not even the same
[00:22:24] Dimension but you know I would if I were
[00:22:27] to choose one yes I I would say I would
[00:22:29] I would alight them is okay I've talked
[00:22:32] about this but Ms paint where are you
[00:22:34] I've talked about this but as far as
[00:22:36] like gench and tier list whoa clickbait
[00:22:38] okay for like who you should pull right
[00:22:40] there's like a bunch of like s tier
[00:22:41] support characters right
[00:22:43] supports right so this is like support
[00:22:45] characters right there's like the hydro
[00:22:46] dudes there's like finina like woo let
[00:22:49] the show begin there's like yolan right
[00:22:51] you only need like one of the two she
[00:22:53] has like a bow there's like [ __ ]
[00:22:55] kazua Nita I don't even that's just a
[00:22:58] Ball but whatever right and then under
[00:23:01] it there's like other supports right
[00:23:03] that are a bit less meta but still good
[00:23:05] but there anything else more interesting
[00:23:08] to do but right under that is like the
[00:23:11] good DPS this is like like like u in
[00:23:13] this is like supports this like okay
[00:23:17] supports like good but not like insane
[00:23:19] right like you know like good like like
[00:23:21] uh
[00:23:21] good this one's like broken right then
[00:23:25] right here is good DPSS because DPSS are
[00:23:28] good but they're not as like Universal
[00:23:30] to your account as good supports now
[00:23:38] net being too popular noet a hassle who
[00:23:43] knew the people would adore me so
[00:23:49] much is a DPS but he kind of transcends
[00:23:53] the the the DPS category and I would put
[00:23:55] him like in between like at almost at
[00:23:57] the level of a support if you just want
[00:23:59] to like clear the ab cuz he's really
[00:24:00] good like he's almost there and the
[00:24:02] closest thing before nevet we had to
[00:24:04] someone of that level in my opinion is
[00:24:06] alyam because of how strong he is with
[00:24:08] like dendro teams and when played
[00:24:10] correctly and I think he's he's a very
[00:24:12] uh powerful individual as well not at
[00:24:14] the same level but very good so I think
[00:24:16] Al Alam is like right under here too as
[00:24:20] well so um that's why I think yeah he's
[00:24:24] he's a good addition but it depends if
[00:24:25] you need a DPS or not right cuz if you
[00:24:26] have two good DPS do you need a third no
[00:24:28] is it nice to have a third yeah but we
[00:24:30] don't need it as
[00:24:33] much you're spreading alham dude what
[00:24:36] are
[00:24:37] you wide
[00:24:43] hyam
[00:24:47] anyways um anyways uh what else are we
[00:24:51] talking about yeah last stream was the
[00:24:53] star rail
[00:24:54] stuff I was expecting a [ __ ] show when I
[00:24:57] came back to get in the day but honestly
[00:24:59] we're
[00:25:02] chilling so we're
[00:25:05] chilling
[00:25:08] um

[00:37:02] internal cool down on her uh burst dude
[00:37:04] you know what Z Jeff taught me today I
[00:37:06] didn't know this I was like okay so I
[00:37:08] pressed the unmit and the grass was on
[00:37:09] fire I'm like okay yeah then I was
[00:37:11] running around with the Luke and I was
[00:37:12] like wait a second why is why duuk not
[00:37:14] lighting grass on fire and you know what
[00:37:15] I realized okay so Bennett's skill
[00:37:19] applies a lot of fire right to you and
[00:37:20] duuke skill doesn't apply that much it's
[00:37:22] one U did you know that you need to
[00:37:23] apply two U of pyro to Grass to make it
[00:37:26] burn so you have to skill and then Ste
[00:37:27] again for the grass to burn and then
[00:37:29] your third one won't make grass burn
[00:37:32] what the [ __ ] why do you need that much
[00:37:33] pyro for grass so if you do something
[00:37:35] like if you just something like e and
[00:37:36] then you run away and then you eat a
[00:37:38] little bit only a bit of grass is going
[00:37:39] to burn
[00:37:41] see duh wait what do you mean duh how
[00:37:44] would you know who is checking the
[00:37:45] elemental gauge of grass who's like yeah
[00:37:48] you need two youu on grass to
[00:37:50] burn me okay guide maker why would I
[00:37:53] need to know grass
[00:37:56] TC
[00:37:58] I'm not
[00:38:07] Overworld what the [ __ ] is two youu two
[00:38:11] units I don't think that makes anything
[00:38:14] simpler but there's a video on it uh uh
[00:38:16] ba Jeff if you want to learn more about
[00:38:18] Elemental
[00:38:20] gauge doesn't know grass TC dude this is
[00:38:23] why serpent spine is good cuz you need
[00:38:25] to you you need two youu to start
[00:38:26] burning
[00:38:32] guide maker duuke has been out for four
[00:38:33] years so where is his guide dude what
[00:38:35] are you yapping about I I I will make a
[00:38:38] delute guide I've been thinking about
[00:38:40] what to call I've actually been thinking
[00:38:41] about what thumbnail to use like my
[00:38:43] thumbnail TX when I make it cuz if a
[00:38:45] character is like a okay cuz I'm going
[00:38:47] to be honest it's a weird balance
[00:38:49] between okay The Duality of duuke with
[00:38:53] his premium
[00:38:55] team and duuke without it is Kind of
[00:38:57] Night and Day or as you could say Dusk
[00:39:00] and Dawn because sorry um and it's like
[00:39:03] duuk with like normal base deluke is
[00:39:05] like okay but duuke at this team
[00:39:08] actually feels really good like actually
[00:39:10] is like close to like really strong like
[00:39:13] is really strong
[00:39:14] actually um and so I need my thumbnail
[00:39:17] to be like I don't know what I'm going
[00:39:19] to call

[00:45:15] some attack as well Sands is is not
[00:45:17] great but it's okay sanss can be hard so

[00:48:06] about you pee fast
[00:48:10] yeah I have a gaming chair so that's
[00:48:13] what that's what a true gaming chair is
[00:48:15] anyways uh okay chat I saw something
[00:48:17] today that really inspired me and I want
[00:48:19] to use it for educational purposes but
[00:48:21] if I show you this clip you have to
[00:48:22] promise not to like okay I mean this
[00:48:25] with no toxicity you guys can't cannot
[00:48:29] do not be mean to this person okay this
[00:48:31] is just for educational purposes okay I
[00:48:33] swear to God this is just for
[00:48:35] educational purposes because it was
[00:48:36] recommended to me from the Twitter
[00:48:37] algorithm and zag also saw the same
[00:48:39] thing so I assume it's popular and it's
[00:48:41] a a thing that a lot of people are going
[00:48:42] to relate to so I want to correct it for
[00:48:44] educational purposes but but but but
[00:48:46] like no judging people that play the
[00:48:47] game casually because that's fine okay
[00:48:49] but I know a lot of you [ __ ] in
[00:48:50] the audience are going to be worse than
[00:48:51] like are worse than this so you can't
[00:48:53] judge but also take this as a lesson
[00:48:55] from me okay so I saw a post saying this
[00:48:59] boss sucks I agree [ __ ] this boss okay I
[00:49:01] agree and again again it's okay to to to
[00:49:05] not be amazing it doesn't matter but I
[00:49:08] was watching this right I was just
[00:49:09] scrolling I was watching this I was just
[00:49:11] watching this right and I was like you
[00:49:14] know I want to watch this clear double
[00:49:15] Hydro Yia you can um swirl right well
[00:49:19] Hydro but you know uh it's fine uh on
[00:49:23] Playstation right it can be more
[00:49:24] difficult to do hard mechanics on like
[00:49:26] PlayStation or on mobile
[00:49:29] right and I was watching right and I was
[00:49:32] like okay like they're clearing you know
[00:49:34] they're breaking the shield and I was
[00:49:35] like while I was watching I was like is
[00:49:37] this like is this normal like is
[00:49:39] plunging this slow really and I was I
[00:49:42] was
[00:49:50] watching and that doesn't matter not
[00:49:52] dodging is fine that happens but now
[00:49:55] what I was realizing is a lot of people
[00:49:57] might plunge that way because I explain
[00:49:59] it in my shenyun guide I talk about it
[00:50:01] cuz shenyun makes you
[00:50:02] plunge so if you wondering hey why am I
[00:50:05] plunging so [ __ ] slow and then I
[00:50:07] watch Zio and he's plunging okay well I
[00:50:09] don't know if I can hear but oh yeah I
[00:50:11] can't hear but I can show you if I find
[00:50:13] the boss why is he plunging so much
[00:50:14] faster than me well there's actually a
[00:50:16] mechanic to plunge a lot faster there's
[00:50:19] a mechanic to plunge a lot faster
[00:50:21] there's a mechanic to plunge where this
[00:50:23] the boss chat does anyone know where is
[00:50:24] this guy in the Overworld where's the
[00:50:26] guy in the over is it here no there's a
[00:50:28] [ __ ] I I marked it but I can't find
[00:50:29] it is it
[00:50:32] here northmost edge of the map oh it's
[00:50:34] that one nice okay let me show you cuz
[00:50:38] if you're plunging like that there's a
[00:50:40] better way and it'll help you a lot in
[00:50:41] the
[00:50:42] abyss also I to suggest something High
[00:50:45] plunging actually matters against that
[00:50:47] boss cuz it does more damage to the
[00:50:48] shield than low plunging true I'm pretty
[00:50:50] sure I mean I only tested it once so I
[00:50:51] could be wrong but from the one time we
[00:50:53] did it it looked like
[00:50:55] it you are so so blind bro how would I
[00:51:00] know so look look look
[00:51:06] look what character are they using Jean
[00:51:09] put Jean
[00:51:15] in we at any
[00:51:22] time so if you plunge by just spamming
[00:51:25] space
[00:51:27] right and then you try to
[00:51:29] jump this is how slow it is right now
[00:51:31] look at how much look at how much I died
[00:51:35] look look at okay okay
[00:51:41] listen look at how much faster you can
[00:51:43] do this if you actually Dash cancel look
[00:51:46] at
[00:51:54] this okay I kind of [ __ ] up that one
[00:51:56] but isn't that like way faster than
[00:52:01] this so you can do way more damage uh
[00:52:04] it's kind of hard to time the like
[00:52:06] plunge attack between low and high
[00:52:08] plunge cuz I saw someone chat say if you
[00:52:10] low plunge you can do more yes but also
[00:52:12] no because the difference between low
[00:52:13] plunge and high plunge is like one frame
[00:52:15] and like if you're doing a high high
[00:52:16] plunge versus a low low plunge obviously
[00:52:19] like you might be able to low plunge a
[00:52:20] lot faster but you can like like this is
[00:52:22] considered a high like like this is a
[00:52:24] low punch but like this is a high
[00:52:28] wait maybe not wait wait this is a low
[00:52:31] punch that was a high punch like there's
[00:52:33] a way to yeah like you'll get used to
[00:52:34] the timing but point is you can do a lot
[00:52:36] faster um High ping it's impossible I
[00:52:40] don't think so I think it's harder on
[00:52:42] iPhone iPad like on mobile it's harder I
[00:52:44] don't think ping affects it cuz it's
[00:52:46] like the same
[00:52:47] inputs ping can [ __ ] you up in other
[00:52:49] ways but it shouldn't really affect that
[00:52:51] I don't
[00:52:55] think
[00:52:57] um now okay now I just wanted to teach
[00:53:00] you guys that educational moment guide
[00:53:02] maker by the way but I also was looking
[00:53:03] at this and I was like dude this would
[00:53:04] be the perfect Abyss the perfect patch
[00:53:07] to either do Abyss reviews or clear
[00:53:10] Abyss reviewers or just that account
[00:53:12] review where you fix the account do
[00:53:13] Abyss I feel like it would be the
[00:53:14] perfect abyss and then we don't delay
[00:53:16] the upload 5
[00:53:20] years how do you jump so high this boss
[00:53:22] makes you jump high or shenyun or JIA
[00:53:33] oh is the stream buffering I think
[00:53:34] that's twitch sorry I don't know what's
[00:53:35] happening but uh another thing is also
[00:53:38] like if you aren't like let's say like
[00:53:40] how do I do this on mobile like I really
[00:53:41] want to like I can't like smam my phone
[00:53:44] like that really easy solution buy a no
[00:53:48] no really easy solution just bring like
[00:53:50] a Geo character or a claymore like [ __ ]
[00:53:52] your team at that cuz this boss is like
[00:53:54] instead of Geo wolf Lord they give us a
[00:53:55] boss with a Geo Shield so like you don't
[00:53:58] but it's cool because you don't need Gio
[00:54:00] you can spam plunge and still break it
[00:54:02] that's what I did but if you're like
[00:54:04] struggling with that or you want to
[00:54:06] break it faster you can just bring like
[00:54:08] a flex slot at the end let's say you
[00:54:10] need okay let's say your DPS your best
[00:54:12] DPS team is this one right and 121 122
[00:54:15] you get three stars with this team 123
[00:54:17] you can't break the shield you can swap
[00:54:19] someone out for like jeang Le Gio
[00:54:21] whatever and then for this boss you use
[00:54:23] that team like for 123 only um so I
[00:54:26] think that would
[00:54:27] help or you could just learn to do it if
[00:54:29] you know like I don't know I haven't
[00:54:31] [ __ ] tried to do sweaty [ __ ] on
[00:54:32] mobile like I play on mobile but I'm not
[00:54:33] like sweating so I don't
[00:54:38] know classic Abyss it's hard to have fun
[00:54:41] uh I I think the abyss sucks I always
[00:54:44] okay I think the abyss is some of the
[00:54:46] worst endgame content that we could get
[00:54:48] because there's so many better things
[00:54:50] that it could be however I kind of don't
[00:54:53] mind this Abyss I think 123 kind of
[00:54:55] sucks penis but like
[00:54:57] I don't
[00:54:58] know actually no these [ __ ] are
[00:55:01] annoying wait let me think let me
[00:55:03] think uh okay objectively it is pretty
[00:55:06] annoying but I kind of like it cuz the
[00:55:08] past few abysses haven't been annoying
[00:55:10] so it's like a a change of
[00:55:13] pace says
[00:55:17] you 123 is yeah 123 is a little a little
[00:55:21] um not
[00:55:23] fun Jade blo Terror rooms fine these are
[00:55:26] fine but you can't see the difference
[00:55:27] between these two these [ __ ]
[00:55:29] operatives you just can't see them they
[00:55:30] get knocked around everywhere um pma's
[00:55:33] fine he should be first half not second
[00:55:34] these guys are fine
[00:55:38] honestly 123 is just annoying that's
[00:55:46] it genin is dead get over it true true
[00:55:50] and we're carrying it on our back and
[00:55:52] we're carrying it on our
[00:55:54] sorry you don't have to time them out
[00:55:57] it's
[00:56:02] fine you can't time out people like that
[00:56:04] cuz if there's a first- Time chatter
[00:56:06] that just chats the hate on genin you
[00:56:07] can't ban them or they'll go to other
[00:56:09] communities be like oh I got banned for
[00:56:11] saying this game you can't do that you
[00:56:12] can't do that you because those are like
[00:56:13] the freedom of speech people and then
[00:56:15] they get all
[00:56:17] racist you can't do

[01:25:08] bad get ready with me as song dude go
[01:25:12] get ready with your parents they miss
[01:25:14] you spend some time with them okay
[01:25:17] anyways let's
[01:25:22] leave not bad not good
[01:25:26] I could say that about a lot of
[01:25:27] things okay there's nothing wrong with
[01:25:33] that for real how do you cancel the
[01:25:35] plunge
[01:25:38] attack wow now boy do I have the perfect
[01:25:42] video for you now if we look up Shan Yun
[01:25:45] guide right by my favorite content
[01:25:47] creator zoox you can see that right
[01:25:49] around here starting let talk sh um
[01:25:55] right around the uh Advanced plunge here
[01:25:57] six minutes Advanced plunging tips you
[01:25:59] can see
[01:26:00] um hit on top of your normal plunge
[01:26:03] damage this is the additional scaling on
[01:26:05] top of your low SL plunge one that will
[01:26:06] give you a second hit of plunge damage
[01:26:07] on every single plunge when you run into
[01:26:08] an enemy the hit box of this will vary
[01:26:10] based on your character and the enemy
[01:26:11] you're fighting with it being especially
[01:26:12] easier so you jump plunge make sure
[01:26:13] you're high enough to where it's high
[01:26:14] plung canel your plunges in general
[01:26:16] through Shan burst you don't jump that
[01:26:17] high so just try to do a high plunge
[01:26:18] plunge attacking just a little bit after
[01:26:20] jumping and not immediately after which
[01:26:22] would result in a low plunge unless
[01:26:24] damage instead another thing you need to
[01:26:26] understand is that you can Dash cancel
[01:26:27] or just cancel plunges in fact typically
[01:26:30] Dash cancelling involves doing a long
[01:26:32] animation and then dashing out of it for
[01:26:34] plunging while this is still true it is
[01:26:36] a dash cancel that is really fast to
[01:26:38] where you don't actually want to be
[01:26:39] dashing you want to do a dash input
[01:26:41] input something to cancel your really
[01:26:42] clunky plunging animation and then
[01:26:44] immediately jump and plunge again thank
[01:26:46] you show you guys what I mean this is a
[01:26:48] really easy way to show it here I'm
[01:26:50] going to be just spamming my space bar
[01:26:51] and trying to plunge without canceling
[01:26:53] it as fast as I can and and as you can
[01:26:54] see it looks something uh like this I'm
[01:26:55] just going to be mashing my space bar
[01:26:57] not really perfect but that's kind of
[01:26:58] the speed but now if I start Dash
[01:27:00] cancelling look at this yeah it's way
[01:27:01] faster I think it was normal attack
[01:27:03] canceling like lowkey cuz I trying to
[01:27:04] like do both but faster and that's not
[01:27:05] even perfect cancels either definitely
[01:27:07] faster to animation cancel your plunges
[01:27:09] than wow faster full on character you
[01:27:11] want to be normal cancelling because you
[01:27:13] can't Dash cancel and it's a lot faster
[01:27:14] if you do if I don't cancel and just SMH
[01:27:16] my space bar this is sort of the speed
[01:27:18] switch to walking kind of and then if I
[01:27:20] were to input a normal attack as you can
[01:27:22] see it's going to be a lot
[01:27:24] faster right that was like wow thanks ax
[01:27:27] wow I I love the video I can't wait to
[01:27:29] go watch okay anyways but yeah that's
[01:27:32] you do
[01:27:35] faster this guy is eight months in the
[01:27:37] making what are you Ying about it's one
[01:27:38] month ago it's this literally one month
[01:27:41] ago this video has dislikes cuz people
[01:27:43] were like oh don't pull on shenu Banner
[01:27:46] we are so mad at genin what are you
[01:27:47] yapping about this was that lore this
[01:27:49] was Duality this was one month ago what
[01:27:51] are you yapping
[01:27:53] about
[01:27:57] one
[01:27:59] guy can I have them use chori's weapon
[01:28:01] dude what are you yapping about sure it
[01:28:05] gives crit
[01:28:06] damage right it's crit damage it's a lot
[01:28:08] of crit
[01:28:13] damage actually let me read
[01:28:18] it um wait how the [ __ ] do I look it
[01:28:21] up it's crit damage and then defense and
[01:28:28] [ __ ] the [ __ ] is it called uraku
[01:28:33] misiri uraku misiri it gives 88 crit
[01:28:37] damage and then normal attack damage and
[01:28:39] skill damage yeah that's good on hyam I
[01:28:42] don't give a [ __ ] if the Geo and defense
[01:28:43] is
[01:28:44] useless uh some help him he ran so much
[01:28:47] out context blood reacted to himself
[01:28:50] crying open the banner oh yeah I'm
[01:28:52] [ __ ] stupid I forgot it's still
[01:28:54] chori's
[01:28:55] Banner
[01:28:58] yeah yeah well you can't see the level
[01:29:00] 90 stats with this but that's it's like
[01:29:02] 88 crit damage at level 90 so it's it's
[01:29:05] it's pretty good normal attack is trash
[01:29:07] on him yeah but who cares it's a bit of
[01:29:09] bonus damage because you are normal
[01:29:10] attacking and then skill damage really
[01:29:12] matters so that's really good that's a
[01:29:15] lot of stats um there's also meta um
[01:29:19] well not I'm not going to say meta but
[01:29:20] there's also viable alyam teams that run
[01:29:22] strong Le like you could do uh usually
[01:29:24] you don't but if you do like uh spread
[01:29:27] you do alham Nita let's say fishal jly
[01:29:30] no healer and you could do harbinger of
[01:29:32] dawn in that team because you don't need
[01:29:33] like you're high HP but you could also
[01:29:35] even here it would be even better right
[01:29:39] is doesn't that work like that after
[01:29:40] nearby character deals Geo damage
[01:29:42] increas by 100% but even without that
[01:29:44] it's 24 skill damage 16% attack normal
[01:29:47] attack damage and
[01:29:53] then
[01:29:57] yeah 20 minutes for a week reset nope
[01:29:59] it's an hour 20 now because daylight
[01:30:01] savings or
[01:30:05] whatever better than Sig is it wait what
[01:30:08] how much does Sig give Sig gives the
[01:30:09] same stats but then it has a different
[01:30:11] effect 4%
[01:30:16] plus oh wait this oh yeah skill and all
[01:30:19] about 120% of
[01:30:21] em 20 uh% em how much em do you run say
[01:30:28] 400 let's say that
[01:30:31] gives wait
[01:30:34] what no that's way too much additive
[01:30:38] yeah but I
[01:30:43] mean yeah that's a lot of
[01:30:50] damage is it maybe if it's like if
[01:30:53] you're playing maybe if it's just spread
[01:30:55] I don't know I mean we could we could
[01:30:57] run into the
[01:31:09] calculator flat additive before crit and
[01:31:11] damage
[01:31:15] percent I mean sure I mean yeah I guess
[01:31:18] that's not that
[01:31:20] great but I don't think that's uh
[01:31:26] the other one's what 12 or is it oh
[01:31:34] 24 can you do a clear with foreplay who
[01:31:37] the [ __ ] is foreplay oh it's
[01:31:52] y
[01:31:58] all right I have to pee again let me
[01:32:00] make my teams first um we'll play Kaza
[01:32:03] first half something with
[01:32:15] Kaza what do I feel like
[01:32:18] playing I do net like some super meta
[01:32:22] team could also do day Ryden kind of
[01:32:24] don't feel like doing de Ryden we'll do
[01:32:27] this with um I don't [ __ ] know
[01:32:29] Cookie's fine
[01:32:35] here second half we'll play
[01:32:43] um why do I kind of want to play Shia
[01:32:52] again
[01:32:57] m al height them weapon for who Al
[01:32:59] height them no but in general for your
[01:33:02] account uh you could argue it I think
[01:33:05] for your account if you're pulling a
[01:33:07] sword though you want Jade Jade cutter
[01:33:09] Miss butter is good for Wales because
[01:33:10] the refinement is good and it's pretty
[01:33:12] good overall but Jade cutter is like I
[01:33:15] don't know I'm a jade cutter
[01:33:17] fan and you always get the
[01:33:22] stats
[01:33:25] MPL as
[01:33:27] conditions Soo or Linny
[01:33:33] umum I don't know how I feel about Soo
[01:33:35] second half I mean
[01:33:40] sure play theuk oh we're supposed to
[01:33:42] play the Luke wait but I need finina I
[01:33:44] mean I guess Nev that doesn't need
[01:33:50] finina all right we'll play duuke Luke
[01:33:55] finina Zan Yun wait how did Darman say
[01:33:59] shenyun one
[01:34:05] second all right class we have
[01:34:08] a swim and glide your fam genin impact
[01:34:12] is an action role playing game available
[01:34:14] on PC Android iOS and Playstation
[01:34:17] players can climb swim and glide your
[01:34:19] way across a beautiful world just
[01:34:21] launched version 4.4 which includes new
[01:34:23] characters like
[01:34:26] zunun all right awesome uh and then last
[01:34:29] thought we're going to play Bennett or
[01:34:30] yolon both work here uh I've heard of
[01:34:33] the team I've heard of this team that I
[01:34:35] want to try I'll either try it off
[01:34:37] stream or later today which is Shan Yun
[01:34:39] and then instead of like finina [ __ ] you
[01:34:42] do cryo swirl with kazua and Rosaria uh
[01:34:46] and then you melt instead of Vape but um
[01:34:49] I want a
[01:34:50] vape so we're going to do
[01:34:55] aanan and then
[01:34:59] Bennett so a cop team no it doesn't it's
[01:35:02] actually not cope cuz as long as you
[01:35:04] apply enough cryo du's duuke applies a
[01:35:08] [ __ ] ton of pyro if you're on Fielding
[01:35:09] him like if you play him normally with
[01:35:11] Shan Yun there's like enough time
[01:35:12] between your plunges that you can of you
[01:35:15] probably should be able to melt same
[01:35:16] with even without Shan Yun you could do
[01:35:18] like I did a Kaa kazawa clear a while
[01:35:22] ago and I Kaa bursted infused my Kos
[01:35:25] thing with cryo and I was still keeping
[01:35:27] up I was still
[01:35:28] melting so you can you can do melt it's
[01:35:30] just more annoying to set up and like
[01:35:32] double swirling is kind of ass hello
[01:35:39] Z zad since you're here you can choose
[01:35:41] the last slot on this team you can
[01:35:43] choose the last slot it could be anyone
[01:35:45] I have to pee so choose that I'm going
[01:35:46] to
[01:35:48] go any character in the
[01:35:51] game any character in the game
[01:36:00] okay he's not
[01:36:03] answering zag sus I'm not adding that
[01:36:06] emote okay we'll add something that
[01:36:08] looks normal so that if I if I play um
[01:36:10] if this is in a video they don't like
[01:36:12] judge me um usually I'd put
[01:36:17] finina I guess dra the fine right just
[01:36:20] get a hydr crystallize [ __ ] it Shields I
[01:36:22] mean I don't need cook at that point
[01:36:24] though so we could do like [ __ ]
[01:36:28] FAL where's FAL
[01:36:32] oh o reveal de's good there de is decent
[01:36:36] is good but the the way you play de with
[01:36:39] net is you like change the team up a bit

[01:36:42] NJ like you I'm not just going to slap
[01:36:44] her in a random
[01:36:52] team

[01:37:49] Discerning palet monat's water is crisp
[01:37:53] and pure while water from Le has an
[01:37:56] enduring aftertaste in inauma the water
[01:37:59] possesses a depth of flavor unlike any
[01:38:02] other suu's water meanwhile has a rich
[01:38:05] and complex flavor profile but it must
[01:38:08] be savored patiently to fully appreciate
[01:38:22] it

[01:46:44] against the PMA if I [ __ ] it up so I
[01:46:46] don't know if I should go for it but in
[01:46:47] theory I press Q here so I don't apply

[01:46:51] run up with bet Q swap the shun basic
[01:46:54] and that's going to swirl pyro but I
[01:46:56] don't know if I want to risk the skill

[01:47:13] shanon [ __ ]
[01:47:15] it wait is it benit e or Q
[01:47:20] first uh boom and then boom I think it's

[01:47:30] e team dream no it was Ethan Q I forgot
[01:47:35] it's fine it's fine whatever it doesn't
[01:47:38] matter
[01:47:45] the maybe it was EQ and I just messed up

[01:58:21] pirate
[01:58:24] main
[01:58:30] the look at what my streamer taught me
[01:58:35] Smo
[01:58:46] silence he supports Vue being cancelled
[01:58:49] I can't believe he made a joke about
[01:58:52] vaping to his young
[01:59:02] audience SM
[01:59:12] true promotes gacha and vaping dude I'm
[01:59:16] glad okay as much as I hate gacha I'm
[01:59:18] glad we play a gacha game so like the
[01:59:20] bar for for stuff is already low so like
[01:59:23] it's already like okay we're playing a
[01:59:24] gacha game so like it can't be much wor
[01:59:26] like you know what you're getting into
[01:59:27] I'm glad cuz if I was dude I wouldn't
[01:59:29] survive in other environments I'm
[01:59:31] sorry use Ron man instead of Bennett use
[01:59:34] your [ __ ] you don't don't talk to
[01:59:38] [Applause]
[01:59:41] me I'm trying to get energy from my
[01:59:43] finina without pressing her
[01:59:48] skill okay that's enough one more um I
[01:59:52] actually do need more energy though more
[01:59:55] enemies no I broke the [ __ ] car the
[01:59:59] let me let me try something let me try
[02:00:03] something we're not this is not going to
[02:00:05] be the good run but I want to see if
[02:00:06] this will work boom boom and then dude
[02:00:08] it's like the timing of the [ __ ] crab
[02:00:10] if it hits as soon as I pyro it removes
[02:00:12] the Pyro and then I can't swirl it's
[02:00:14] just like it's just lock it's just lock
[02:00:16] it's just
[02:00:19] lock you need hold e on [ __ ]
[02:00:29] Bennett to level
[02:00:32] one for C4 oh I mean sure but isn't that
[02:00:36] a waste of his if you're alting first
[02:00:38] it's not a waste of cuz you can do it
[02:00:40] with tap like I've done it with tap and
[02:00:42] if you can do it with tap then wouldn't
[02:00:44] holding e just be wasting a second I
[02:00:45] guess it doesn't
[02:00:50] matter or just C6 Bennett yeah I guess
[02:00:55] but I'm not cixing
[02:00:58] Bennett actually I am I'm probably will
[02:01:00] C6 benett but not
[02:01:06] now probably should give those particles
[02:01:08] to
[02:01:13] net no rest for the
[02:01:17] wicked solid
[02:01:20] silence
[02:01:23] Cloud's the

[02:02:26] you don't have to do it though that's
[02:02:27] the [ __ ] part but if the crab hits then
[02:02:29] you have to whatever I guess I'll just
[02:02:31] do
[02:02:37] it okay I'm going to stop I'm going to
[02:02:43] stop dude you know how long it takes to

[03:01:20] to lie that's really good this is pretty
[03:01:22] good too that's pretty good too you got
[03:01:24] a good amount of crit value uh although
[03:01:26] crit raate with Mar and shenyun is like
[03:01:28] well you have hom it's actually fine
[03:01:31] that's okay uh it's okay not better than
[03:01:34] mine but it's okay that's actually
[03:01:36] pretty good you got er you got attack
[03:01:37] you got crit
[03:01:40] uh it's probably just my mind playing
[03:01:42] tricks on
[03:01:45] me that's okay for an offset piece
[03:01:49] okay that's good no attack not better
[03:01:53] than mine I could ban you for this but
[03:01:55] this goblet is illegal um no that's good
[03:01:59] that's good uh now I will
[03:02:02] say it's far better you're just coping
[03:02:05] now I will say if you're trying to be
[03:02:07] turbo optimal here's what you need to
[03:02:08] know you are playing mag CH which means
[03:02:10] all you care about is okay not all you
[03:02:12] care about but for the but this means
[03:02:13] you're playing with finina and probably
[03:02:15] in like his meta team right if you're
[03:02:17] doing that then you want more uh uh
[03:02:20] attack percent and you don't actually
[03:02:22] need ER if you're playing like C6 Faron
[03:02:24] and shenyun and Sh uh 120 still not bad
[03:02:29] but level your [ __ ] talents people
[03:02:31] aren't exactly the typ who just up on
[03:02:33] the street your flower could definitely
[03:02:35] be better for an
[03:02:38] offset and
[03:02:40] um yeah wellit how much crit raate you
[03:02:42] gain 36 and then Shen Yun 812 M50
[03:02:48] 9,500 do you even have
[03:02:51] shenyun cuz if you okay if you don't
[03:02:53] have
[03:02:55] shenyun I don't have okay you're dude
[03:02:57] you need okay okay okay okay okay okay
[03:03:00] okay if you dude dude dude dude dude dud
[03:03:02] dude Mar J is not even okay it's not
[03:03:05] even better then if you don't have
[03:03:07] shenyun it's not even better the reason
[03:03:09] m is better with shenyun is cuz she
[03:03:11] scales well with crit like your crit uh
[03:03:13] damage and stuff but not your attack but
[03:03:16] if you're not running shenyun then mine
[03:03:18] is just literally clears you a little
[03:03:19] bro I'm sorry uh you should level your
[03:03:21] normal attacks though to 10 the rest is
[03:03:27] fine
[03:03:30] okay insane goblet misleading
[03:03:34] name but good
[03:03:39] Shia his
[03:03:41] short he's only short because you didn't

[03:28:21] was a the [ __ ] Freudian
[03:28:26] slip
[03:28:38] caught Gamers
[03:28:43] I'm testing out shiori in her I will say
[03:28:46] though I don't know if we're actually
[03:28:47] going to watch this but I will say if I
[03:28:48] do chori is very much whatever right
[03:28:53] like she's very much whatever like she's
[03:28:54] basically just a better albo but do you
[03:28:56] need a better
[03:28:58] albo no maybe like if you want that's
[03:29:02] fine but it's not like um like I would
[03:29:04] never tell anyone yeah you need to pull
[03:29:06] for her but I don't think she's like bad
[03:29:08] like yeah you should Tau she's just
[03:29:14] okay um
[03:29:20] yeah you can use her with ALB too you
[03:29:23] don't really need any character yeah but
[03:29:25] that's also not like that's not a like
[03:29:30] um what we're talking about right like
[03:29:32] obviously you don't need anyone but it's
[03:29:35] not like she's not in the same league as
[03:29:36] like Nita or like
[03:29:38] kazua but she's she's okay like her
[03:29:41] damage is pretty good it's just for geo
[03:29:43] teams and like her skill doesn't
[03:29:45] snapshot which sucks
[03:29:50] penis but yeah she's mid then yeah I
[03:29:54] think she's pretty mid um but not mid in
[03:29:56] the mid way that people say mid when any
[03:29:58] character is like like terrible they'll
[03:30:01] just say mid I think she's like okay
[03:30:03] like she's not bad like dog [ __ ] she's
[03:30:06] okay um it just dep like it's weird cuz
[03:30:10] it's
[03:30:13] like hello there's a lot of accounts
[03:30:16] that just won't use
[03:30:19] her but there's accounts like there's
[03:30:21] teams where she's actually pretty good
[03:30:23] like if you're playing like EO playing
[03:30:24] even Noel although Noel kind of wants C1
[03:30:27] like Navia but you don't need C1 it's
[03:30:28] just like a big increase you don't still
[03:30:30] don't need it it'll still be but at that
[03:30:31] point like the people are like oh c
[03:30:33] one's overhyped you don't need it for
[03:30:34] Navia you don't need it for Noel and
[03:30:35] that's also kind of what I said in my
[03:30:37] guide but also if I'm being very honest
[03:30:39] at that point are you really pulling for
[03:30:40] a very minuscule upgrade to your albo
[03:30:42] for a Navia team probably not so at that
[03:30:44] point you would want see one even though
[03:30:46] not really needed
[03:30:48] anyways run here and I've got a rant for
[03:30:50] a second in 2024 why are they still
[03:30:54] giving us these random units and not
[03:30:56] allowing us to use our own teams let me
[03:30:59] test her on my team to see if she's any
[03:31:01] good you know what I'm saying let me try
[03:31:03] her with Aro let me try her with Navia
[03:31:06] let me use my Max I agree about the
[03:31:08] trials although they did make it better
[03:31:10] they've actually started giving us
[03:31:11] decent teams but yeah Goro and see if
[03:31:14] it's like cracked I agree she's AIT
[03:31:17] scaling unit so you need attack and so
[03:31:19] Bennett can work but she ALS oh also I
[03:31:22] said this my guide dude part of the
[03:31:24] reason I gu is so long is cuz I include
[03:31:25] a bunch of [ __ ] that no one asked for
[03:31:27] but that I as a viewer I would like love
[03:31:29] to see I
[03:31:31] said that I don't think we should call a
[03:31:33] scaling like this split scaling but
[03:31:35] instead dual scaling because it's not
[03:31:38] actually split like it's attack and
[03:31:41] defense but it's not like her skills
[03:31:43] attack and her alt is defense or vice
[03:31:46] Versa it's both of them like are added
[03:31:50] and like okay how do I say this all of
[03:31:51] her kit skills both with attack and
[03:31:53] defense which means yeah it's in that
[03:31:56] situation building crit and damage
[03:31:57] percent will be more sort of important
[03:31:59] because it just Buffs everything but
[03:32:01] it's also like you benefit from defense
[03:32:03] but you also benefit from Attack uh
[03:32:06] would her scaling be lower than if it
[03:32:08] were like just all defense yeah like
[03:32:11] that might be better but as long as the
[03:32:13] damage is good and the Skilling together
[03:32:14] is high enough uh it doesn't matter it's
[03:32:17] not really split unless skill is one and
[03:32:19] burst is the other if they're added
[03:32:21] together like a good example from chat
[03:32:23] and I think Z video also touched on this
[03:32:25] is alham that scales on like there's
[03:32:28] attack and there's em but no one's
[03:32:29] complaining about this right um however
[03:32:33] like again albo is a fine character like
[03:32:35] I'm not trying to use him as like the
[03:32:37] bad example like he's a fine character
[03:32:39] but uh albo's skill defense obviously
[03:32:43] there's attack here but like the the
[03:32:45] damage over over time like that's
[03:32:46] constantly doing is defense and then
[03:32:48] burst will be attack right like that's
[03:32:51] different um and in in this situation
[03:32:53] also like you could argue like okay you
[03:32:55] build crit to buff both but um a lot of
[03:32:57] people use albo just for the skill but
[03:32:59] anyways also has defense scaling so can
[03:33:02] I maybe use both units to boost up both
[03:33:04] stats and make this crazy DP I don't
[03:33:06] know I don't know also that would be a
[03:33:08] good idea Tash if her skill snapshotted
[03:33:10] I think that's the biggest design
[03:33:12] failure of chori there's no reason for
[03:33:13] skill not to snapshot when alvados does
[03:33:15] there's no reason there's legit no
[03:33:17] reason you summon Fel does and it's the
[03:33:18] same thing you summon a [ __ ] thing
[03:33:20] and it stays there if it snapshotted
[03:33:22] Goro and Bennett like eo's teams often
[03:33:24] times will be etto Goro chori and then
[03:33:26] Flex you can use Bennett and if you're
[03:33:28] using Bennett and Goro you you would
[03:33:31] think okay I'll go chori I I'll buff
[03:33:33] then I'll go chori then I'll go Ito but
[03:33:36] your Bennett and Goro don't even buff
[03:33:38] your chori because it B it Buffs her
[03:33:40] while she's on field she swaps out it
[03:33:42] doesn't buff anymore because it doesn't
[03:33:43] snapshot for those of you asking what
[03:33:44] snapshotting means that's it spend money
[03:33:47] to do that or I need a test server to do
[03:33:48] so it's like why would I waste my
[03:33:50] Bennett's up time on her why would I Bas
[03:33:51] my Goro like Goro lasts like 10 seconds
[03:33:53] why would I waste that on her if she
[03:33:55] doesn't snapshot if she did huge anyways
[03:33:57] she's still like pretty good in that
[03:34:00] team and better than albo but I wish she
[03:34:02] not and it's like I think this is so
[03:34:06] stupid I think it is bad practice
[03:34:08] because instead of giving us an
[03:34:09] opportunity to decide yeah this
[03:34:12] character is going to work really good
[03:34:13] with my teams I'm going to make that
[03:34:15] purchase
[03:34:16] you just have to like watch people's
[03:34:18] guides or watch
[03:34:20] people and I feel like everyone is just
[03:34:24] does he dislike shenan yes he dislikes
[03:34:27] Shen Yun which I disagreed with I think
[03:34:29] Shen yun's great I'm the biggest I look
[03:34:31] like I don't think she's needed for
[03:34:32] everyone but at wor she's Gan at best
[03:34:34] she breaks her the [ __ ] team you're
[03:34:36] running but it depends who you're
[03:34:36] running that's what I meant
[03:34:40] okay like in a situation where this is
[03:34:44] not also I'm going to pausing I swear to
[03:34:48] God actually I'll say this later a great
[03:34:50] represent of the character so you can't
[03:34:53] understand if they're good she's built
[03:34:55] with golden troop and so it's like well
[03:34:58] is she going to be an off field DPS
[03:35:00] that's a good set on her at the same
[03:35:01] time she can Infuse herself and do geo
[03:35:04] damage and be like a
[03:35:06] main main DPS whatever you want to call
[03:35:08] it she can get normal attack bonuses
[03:35:11] which is awesome and you can Infuse and
[03:35:12] do that quickly but she's also good
[03:35:14] Elemental skill damage and she's just
[03:35:16] this mixed bag but isn't being supported
[03:35:19] properly in my opinion and so it's like
[03:35:22] yeah shang's fine she does some damage
[03:35:23] she like whips around some fire and
[03:35:25] that's wait why are they all dragon's
[03:35:27] vein Shang Ling in this you are not
[03:35:29] you're [ __ ] hot rock reaction is
[03:35:32] there not a better situation or a better
[03:35:34] setup that I could use this unit to her
[03:35:36] full potential and see like oh yeah this
[03:35:38] is this is this is going to work I just
[03:35:40] hate that yeah I agree Tri should be
[03:35:42] better although this team is not bad by
[03:35:43] the way my current play test of her
[03:35:46] I don't like her I don't like her but
[03:35:48] maybe I would if I had Goro on my team
[03:35:51] if I had some of these other supports
[03:35:52] maybe I'd be more happy with it but I
[03:35:54] want to talk about the character um I
[03:35:57] don't like her and I want to explain why
[03:36:00] number
[03:36:01] one she can Infuse her normal attacks
[03:36:05] and she could be a main DPS but the
[03:36:08] infusion is quite short and she almost
[03:36:11] wants to be played as like a quick
[03:36:12] swapping type unit based on her
[03:36:14] cooldowns for me the way she okay yeah
[03:36:17] Yin does this thing where they try to
[03:36:19] make a character like they they try to
[03:36:20] show how you can use this character in
[03:36:22] so many different ways kind of like
[03:36:24] kokomi when kokomi came out I remember a
[03:36:27] lot of people see sixer a lot of people
[03:36:29] use their main DPS a lot of people were
[03:36:31] like wow this is doing less than my
[03:36:33] [ __ ] Hut wow this character sucks
[03:36:35] when in reality you just use her off
[03:36:37] field and I remember I also underrated
[03:36:40] her but I remember being like you know
[03:36:41] you can still use her thring tails you
[03:36:43] can still just use her for hydro heal
[03:36:45] yeah you have Barbara but like for free
[03:36:47] which was the main like counter argument
[03:36:48] but you know you can MTH on her you can
[03:36:50] do that
[03:36:52] right and I don't know if he's going to
[03:36:54] say this about chori but they do this
[03:36:56] thing where they kind of try to push a
[03:36:57] character like hey you can also main DPS
[03:36:59] them if you want which is cool for like
[03:37:00] casual players if you want to use your
[03:37:02] chy on field because you like looking at
[03:37:03] her cool but it also kind of confuses
[03:37:06] people to think like okay this is how I
[03:37:07] should play her and then they play her
[03:37:09] like that and they're like wow this is
[03:37:10] kind of mid like for kakomi it's like
[03:37:12] you press your e you swap out and she's
[03:37:15] actually really good character and
[03:37:16] there's some teams where she can be good
[03:37:18] main DPS as well like this is more of a
[03:37:20] newer thing but like you can run with
[03:37:21] like finina Kaza or like there's a lot
[03:37:23] of actual pretty decent teams using her
[03:37:25] on field but if you just look at ki's
[03:37:27] onfield damage you'll be like this
[03:37:28] character is not that good but that's
[03:37:30] not how you play her usually you just
[03:37:32] like press e you get a bunch of utility
[03:37:34] healing this that this that um chori is
[03:37:37] also not the same but you press your
[03:37:38] skill you get the [ __ ] out you burst as
[03:37:40] well if you have it but yeah he feels
[03:37:43] for me I just do not like uh her
[03:37:46] personally but also she
[03:37:48] scaling unless I'm dumb which I am yeah
[03:37:53] normal attacks don't scale with defense
[03:37:54] it's such bait like you don't want to
[03:37:56] play like like that's why I didn't
[03:37:57] include that play style in my guide I'm
[03:37:59] very much a make a long guide include
[03:38:01] everything but if the play style is dog
[03:38:03] [ __ ] I'm not going to include it I'm
[03:38:04] sorry like sometimes I do but for the
[03:38:07] most part it's like if it's just bad
[03:38:09] I'll tell you hey you can do this if you
[03:38:10] want but don't do it cuz like why would
[03:38:12] I be like hey yeah use either when one
[03:38:14] of them's clearly [ __ ] if you want with
[03:38:18] attack on her normal attacks and so it's
[03:38:21] like okay so building all the defense
[03:38:25] that is scaling like okay I'm I'm trying
[03:38:27] to make a delute guide I'm not going to
[03:38:28] include a section about full em flower
[03:38:30] of paradise lost buron and I love buron
[03:38:33] I think it's fun but like at that point
[03:38:35] play vape and buron like V like Vape
[03:38:37] melt or not Vape melt sorry what is it
[03:38:39] called Vape uh what's the reaction
[03:38:41] called burning burn Vape like you're not
[03:38:43] going to go full triple em like I don't
[03:38:45] know virgin
[03:38:48] true stuff is now being wasted for the
[03:38:51] normal attack I hate that I just hate
[03:38:55] that if you want me to be a split
[03:38:57] scaling unit and you want me to consider
[03:38:59] investing in defense and you're going to
[03:39:01] put it on some of my abilities put some
[03:39:03] on here give me a couple that's what I
[03:39:05] saying where it all of her abilities are
[03:39:07] defense but you're not supposed to
[03:39:08] normal attack so this defense is just
[03:39:10] extra but if that's the case like I
[03:39:12] don't know I just hate when they do that
[03:39:15] I just just despise it um arataki or
[03:39:18] sorry ayato does that with a little bit
[03:39:20] of HP scaling and you can get a little
[03:39:22] bit of extra value from the Jade cutter
[03:39:24] and things like that but I don't know I
[03:39:26] just don't like the way that this is
[03:39:28] implemented myself especially when I
[03:39:31] can't supplement it with Goro or
[03:39:33] something like that to give me some flat
[03:39:34] defense y yada y just don't like that as
[03:39:38] for her skill
[03:39:39] ability I don't know about this one
[03:39:41] Gamers I tried this out a few times and
[03:39:44] I just don't like the feel of it number
[03:39:45] one is I can Dash I actually dm' them
[03:39:48] Dash or he dm' me he's like yo sometimes
[03:39:50] we're new characters we should like talk
[03:39:52] about them if like I don't like them and
[03:39:53] you like them or you don't like them and
[03:39:55] I like them and like I feel like it'd be
[03:39:56] good for the community I was like yeah I
[03:39:58] think we should if ever there's like a
[03:39:59] disagree like I'm not going to force a
[03:40:00] disagreement if we're on the same page
[03:40:02] that's not a bad idea however I think
[03:40:04] here so far it just he feels like she's
[03:40:06] a main DPS I think that's the only thing
[03:40:07] like she's not or like an on Fielder
[03:40:09] when she's not I think that's the only
[03:40:10] thing I mean I could be wrong it's 3
[03:40:11] minutes in and I can
[03:40:14] attack
[03:40:16] cool and and now I've got this little
[03:40:18] unit that will attack enemies the issue
[03:40:22] is the cool down is like forever yeah
[03:40:25] but it lasts forever very very long it
[03:40:27] doesn't matter it last forever forever
[03:40:29] and my Geo infusion is only for five
[03:40:31] seconds okay yeah on top of that you can
[03:40:33] hold this down and you can Dash in the
[03:40:36] air and you can do a plunging attack and
[03:40:38] Infuse still right you can just stay on
[03:40:40] the field and do that
[03:40:41] yourself but but if you are um pressured
[03:40:47] by enemies sometimes what she will do is
[03:40:51] it will it like even if you aim like in
[03:40:53] the air there's an enemy close to you
[03:40:54] sometimes she'll just like Dash like she
[03:40:56] won't even and it
[03:40:58] won't have time to do the swap it still
[03:41:01] lets you do the swap but it just feels
[03:41:04] so clunky and there are some situations
[03:41:07] where maybe I want to jump up above a
[03:41:09] group of enemies but it it like it like
[03:41:12] stops you on an enemy oh my God I hate
[03:41:15] it it feels so trash to me now her
[03:41:19] little tomato guy it attacks so slow bro
[03:41:24] it attacks so slow and it's like single
[03:41:27] Target now Oz right if you look at Oz
[03:41:30] from fishell he's like joining into
[03:41:32] attacks I can attack here doesn't matter
[03:41:35] if it's her or another unit it's not
[03:41:38] speeding up it's not attacking I think
[03:41:41] this is one of the worst summoned units
[03:41:44] in the game one of the worst
[03:41:45] okay uh I mean just damage wise you look
[03:41:48] at the scaling compared to like albo
[03:41:49] it's pretty good but obviously Oz is
[03:41:51] [ __ ] broken with that in mind I will
[03:41:55] say it is very clear that it's just like
[03:41:59] like all the complaints he's making is
[03:42:00] for onfield main DPS chori basically Geo
[03:42:04] infusion is too low which
[03:42:06] true and the summon like you can't spam
[03:42:08] your skill because you're infused for 4
[03:42:10] seconds I think I think it's 4 seconds
[03:42:11] whatever I'm going to trust myself 4
[03:42:12] seconds and you um I don't know where it
[03:42:16] says it
[03:42:17] here 5 Seconds whatever why would I
[03:42:20] think it's four it's [ __ ] five you
[03:42:21] dumbass sorry 5 seconds and it's a 16c
[03:42:23] cool down but the cool down is not
[03:42:25] actually long because it lasts 17
[03:42:26] seconds so it's 100% off time but the
[03:42:28] thing is it's like all I did when making
[03:42:31] like all I did when look at this
[03:42:32] character was okay should I use my
[03:42:35] should I stay on field or swap I clicked
[03:42:37] here okay if you swap look at this giant
[03:42:40] ass effect [ __ ] Yu-Gi-Oh description
[03:42:42] if you swap AOE damage from off field
[03:42:45] Geo damage skill damage it does
[03:42:47] coordinate attacks two of them okay what
[03:42:49] if you're on
[03:42:51] field 5 seconds and then what do you get
[03:42:55] this scaling
[03:42:57] wow so like okay I'm not using our on
[03:43:00] field but I get why casual player doing
[03:43:03] the trial you're like oh cool I can
[03:43:04] Infuse my attack of
[03:43:09] Geo I think the only cringe thing is
[03:43:12] that you're forced to swap to the next
[03:43:14] character so you have to like plan your
[03:43:15] team order which I think is cool that's
[03:43:17] like in Innovative Innovative but it's
[03:43:20] also kind of cringe cuz it's like [ __ ] I
[03:43:21] have to reset the whole Abyss cuz I mess
[03:43:23] my team order little pet summons I've
[03:43:26] ever seen now that actually was an AOE
[03:43:28] hit but they got to be damn close now I
[03:43:31] can also it is a bit of I can also start
[03:43:35] summoning in geoc
[03:43:37] constructs and if I'm using my stuff now
[03:43:40] I've got two little tomato guys and so
[03:43:43] that's cool that's fun the damage is
[03:43:45] actually pretty decent that's
[03:43:47] fine like that was 16k 16k your ning
[03:43:50] Wong to like if I would like to I
[03:43:53] ability cool Downs that's 900 hours long
[03:43:56] hold on here I can also what is lagging
[03:44:02] swap to my other character and I could
[03:44:05] slam down and I've got these little
[03:44:07] tomato guys to help
[03:44:09] out but I do not like like for reference
[03:44:12] your tomato did as much damage as your
[03:44:14] WI ning I know ning is not like meta
[03:44:17] like that's not like the pillar of meta
[03:44:20] but down oh no that's a 29k and I mean
[03:44:23] you have two two 16 * 2 is 32 Which is
[03:44:25] higher than that but anyway
[03:44:28] help but I do not like that play style
[03:44:31] at all I just feel like it's
[03:44:34] clunky when I use her as a main DPS I
[03:44:38] don't feel like she's infused long
[03:44:39] enough to benefit cuz usually that 29k
[03:44:42] is from chori wa did I miss see it what
[03:44:43] was the plunge I'm like lagging the
[03:44:45] video's like lagging a bit what was the
[03:44:47] plunge and I can oh yeah wait that was
[03:44:51] wait why was the plunge so low I didn't
[03:44:52] crit I guess well he didn't crit so we
[03:44:54] can't really judge it that is guys to
[03:44:57] help out I just feel feel like she's
[03:45:00] infused long enough to benefit cuz
[03:45:02] usually what you want to do is you want
[03:45:04] to um you know pop through pop your
[03:45:08] support units you want to go in and you
[03:45:10] want to main DPS it okay it's dead you
[03:45:12] want to main DPS it for a little bit and
[03:45:15] then you swap back but because she's
[03:45:17] only infused for 5 seconds there's dead
[03:45:21] time there's dead time on herself not
[03:45:24] being infused or there's dead time where
[03:45:27] you don't have enough energy or you
[03:45:29] don't have any of your stuff on cool
[03:45:32] down that she is either doing minimal
[03:45:35] DPS because she's not infused anymore or
[03:45:39] your other units don't have any anything
[03:45:41] ready to go I think she's trash like I I
[03:45:44] can not stand her in the current state
[03:45:46] with these current teams from what I can
[03:45:48] see I just don't see the potential but
[03:45:50] maybe it would change if I was using
[03:45:51] something else and like her Ultimate
[03:45:54] Looks cool and stuff but it's
[03:45:55] essentially just an AOE
[03:45:58] slash and like that's all the utility
[03:46:01] it's providing is like yeah all sucks
[03:46:04] but
[03:46:04] like it it's that's not how you're
[03:46:07] supposed to play her um obviously you
[03:46:09] won't know that just from the trial and
[03:46:11] I think that's a fair criticism like IG
[03:46:13] infused for only [ __ ] 5 seconds but
[03:46:16] yeah that's not you're supposed to like
[03:46:17] that's
[03:46:18] not yeah just don't think it's
[03:46:21] acceptable I'm sorry I'm looking through
[03:46:24] this thing and I'm like damn this chick
[03:46:25] is busted in a bad way she's she's like
[03:46:29] not the kid is incomplete unless you
[03:46:30] have C6 I
[03:46:32] mean yes if you're trying to main dpser
[03:46:35] but that's the same with like
[03:46:36] kazua but like you're not I I get Kaz
[03:46:40] does have anemo infusion at [ __ ] C1
[03:46:41] or C 0 but like you just e e like I
[03:46:45] think e normal attack should not be in
[03:46:47] the game until C6 well it's a cool
[03:46:49] option if you want to like I get what
[03:46:51] they're doing with some Geo characters
[03:46:52] like Navia in theory has some downtime
[03:46:54] like in theory Nava's rotation would be
[03:46:56] like E Auto attack a bit E Auto attack a
[03:46:58] bit and then waiting for your cool down
[03:46:59] you could DPS on another character which
[03:47:01] in practice you don't really do because
[03:47:03] you just cycle through your supports but
[03:47:04] like it makes sense like when I first
[03:47:06] saw Navia I'm like oh this will be cool
[03:47:08] with a future Navia or a future
[03:47:10] character that has a little bit of fi
[03:47:12] time like you can do that right you can
[03:47:15] play ning Wong with her you can play
[03:47:17] chori with her but even in that team
[03:47:19] chori's not Auto attacking she's just
[03:47:22] e valuable in my opinion um I think that
[03:47:28] Navia is just like a better geod DPS
[03:47:30] unit yes absolutely I think that if you
[03:47:34] look at you know this getting the geoc
[03:47:36] construct is cool getting you some
[03:47:38] Elemental damage but half the Geo
[03:47:40] constructs in the game get blown up by
[03:47:42] Bosses they they don't even stay on the
[03:47:44] field half the time and so I could pair
[03:47:47] her with like J Lee and get some Shields
[03:47:49] and like that would be okay that'd be
[03:47:50] fine but realistically I think that this
[03:47:52] is a big Skip and someone might have a
[03:47:55] situation or a team where she's like
[03:47:57] doing fine Gio I don't care I think
[03:48:02] investing in her doing pulls on her
[03:48:04] Banner getting potentially goros to
[03:48:06] support her just don't just don't bro go
[03:48:09] get noet go get some of the archons go
[03:48:11] get Kad go get anyone else but I just
[03:48:14] think that this is I don't care based
[03:48:17] I'm sure people find her cute and
[03:48:19] they're going to pull for her but I'm so
[03:48:21] like strength focused and and like com I
[03:48:23] mean I agree she could tell me to go
[03:48:25] [ __ ] myself and I'd say thank you uh but
[03:48:28] regardless of that she's like a Geo
[03:48:30] support's not going to be meta
[03:48:32] like I know Jeong Lee is like oh cool
[03:48:35] Shield res Shad like they tried to make
[03:48:36] him Universal and he kind of is like I
[03:48:38] like Jong Lee he's good but like Geo
[03:48:40] support for geo teams won't be pulled
[03:48:42] for everyone like you know uh
[03:48:45] um
[03:48:49] but if you're playing uh a Geo team or a
[03:48:52] team that can use her she's pretty good
[03:48:54] for Focus she feels bad to play in my
[03:48:56] opinion and on top of that like are you
[03:48:59] going to [ __ ] are you going to aim in
[03:49:00] the air no don't hold your skill don't
[03:49:01] hold your skill don't hold your like
[03:49:03] like like like like don't hold your
[03:49:05] skill there's characters who have hold
[03:49:07] skill that you don't know because you
[03:49:08] never use it until rizle came out and
[03:49:10] you wanted to hold skill on Shena I
[03:49:12] didn't even I forgot she had a hold
[03:49:13] skill I know oh G you charge attack
[03:49:15] don't talk to me but like I like there's
[03:49:17] characters where you don't hold skill it
[03:49:19] is what it is I don't hold skill for
[03:49:22] ushi for me this unit um is one of the
[03:49:26] worst units like you see that entire
[03:49:29] ning Wong rotation chori did more but
[03:49:31] with like her two tomoto in like two
[03:49:33] seconds that I played in a long time she
[03:49:36] still doesn't have EB back bro I was
[03:49:38] yapping I was yapping and she still
[03:49:40] doesn't have it back if I use this thing
[03:49:43] and I'm infused
[03:49:45] I use my ultimate and I'm like let's go
[03:49:47] let's rotate through everyone come on
[03:49:49] boys let's go yep let's go back into sh
[03:49:52] She's Got 5
[03:49:54] Seconds She's Got 5 seconds until she
[03:49:57] can do her proper damage get out of here
[03:50:00] I'm done I'm done I'm done oops I
[03:50:02] clicked on what the [ __ ] did I just
[03:50:03] click on uh I mean that's funny but okay
[03:50:07] he just thinks she's a DPS like that's
[03:50:08] it that's just what it is like an on
[03:50:09] Fielder and she isn't
[03:50:11] like if anything like
[03:50:16] that's like like okay that's like if I'm
[03:50:17] like like she's just a support that's
[03:50:19] like if I'll yeah yeah I I get it like
[03:50:21] he she has Geo infusion so she'll bait
[03:50:23] you to think that but that's not how
[03:50:24] she's played right like I'm not like
[03:50:27] what's
[03:50:29] that like imagine playing
[03:50:35] IO and then being like what there's 6
[03:50:41] seconds but I was actually on Fielder
[03:50:43] right it sure isn't
[03:50:46] because if she was if she was an on
[03:50:48] Fielder and you were supposed to do this
[03:50:50] then the cool down here would be
[03:50:51] disgusting it'd be terrible and like if
[03:50:53] that's what you have to do at that point
[03:50:54] play like sack sword if it even works or
[03:50:56] some [ __ ] um but yeah that is that his
[03:51:01] fault for not understanding I wouldn't
[03:51:03] like you know yes but also the trial
[03:51:06] kind of probably paints it as like hey
[03:51:08] you can play her on field so like I get
[03:51:10] it
[03:51:12] um trials description wait what the
[03:51:14] trial
[03:51:17] description the [ __ ] does the trial
[03:51:21] say after using a skill CH will toot to
[03:51:24] attack execute upward sweep for a short
[03:51:26] time after upward sweep one of the
[03:51:27] following effects may be
[03:51:28] triggered uh
[03:51:38] yeah like all you're supposed to do is
[03:51:41] this and then that and then you just
[03:51:43] play your [ __ ] other characters right
[03:51:50] I am the cuttingedge of
[03:51:53] fashion boom boom boom and then you do
[03:51:57] this and now there's two like there's
[03:51:59] two dudes let's say I stay in Ben
[03:52:02] burst okay well those guys are dead
[03:52:05] but you know it's
[03:52:07] a can I

[03:56:43] anyways I hope you're doing well I hope
[03:56:45] you're having a pleasant splendid
[03:57:13] day
[03:57:14] CH what is the power creep truth about
[03:57:16] chiori I'm not going to react at all but
[03:57:19] like what is what is it what is the
[03:57:20] power creep truth does she power
[03:57:33] creep overall I feel kind of weird about
[03:57:35] this I'm not ready to declare that of
[03:57:38] life our creeping albo but I also cannot
[03:57:40] ignore what I just witnessed so all in
[03:57:42] all I want to say that you she does but
[03:57:44] also who cares cuz you could use them
[03:57:46] together like it's fine single Target
[03:57:48] while Al could potentially be as good as
[03:57:50] her when in AOE scenario I'm going to be
[03:57:52] honest that just said incorrect weapon
[03:57:55] information uh whatever I mean like not
[03:57:57] whatever but like I'm not going to like
[03:57:58] go in depth on that but um at least he's
[03:58:01] using Harbinger
[03:58:03] uh the the the thing I think genin I
[03:58:06] don't think this is a hot take at all I
[03:58:08] think genon did a like did a
[03:58:11] pretty of all the bad [ __ ] they do I am
[03:58:14] thankful it's not the standard Turbo
[03:58:17] Power creep every new character gotcha
[03:58:19] like most gachas are that's like the one
[03:58:22] thing I'm happy for I would say like
[03:58:24] there have been some exceptions I think
[03:58:27] nlet is like the closest thing to power
[03:58:29] creep I've talked about this he's just
[03:58:31] like sorry Ayo io's still good but never
[03:58:33] is just [ __ ] stupidly broken
[03:58:37] um but for a lot of it it's
[03:58:41] like it that's the one thing that makes
[03:58:44] the game allow like I feel like they get
[03:58:47] away they get to get away with being a
[03:58:50] gacha a lot more in my book because the
[03:58:52] four stars are so broken at least the
[03:58:54] early ones and there's so many like good
[03:58:57] characters and and good like old
[03:58:59] characters too um and it's not just
[03:59:01] power creep power creep power creep
[03:59:02] power creep and then it's like like yes
[03:59:04] I want more endgame but I would hope
[03:59:06] that the new endgame isn't just oh you
[03:59:08] need [ __ ] net Kaza Nita I know that's
[03:59:11] not like the best team but you get my
[03:59:12] point like [ __ ] best DPS in the game
[03:59:15] to clear it or like C6 cuz I don't think
[03:59:19] they would do that I think they're
[03:59:20] pretty so far they're pretty good at
[03:59:22] obviously I want more [ __ ] content
[03:59:23] but they're pretty good at not just
[03:59:25] making every character way better than
[03:59:27] the last
[03:59:31] few I don't think it's power cre because
[03:59:32] nevet plays different from AO he does
[03:59:34] and AO has more off field presence but
[03:59:37] it's really hard the only thing for me
[03:59:39] is like it's hard to see a situation
[03:59:41] where I would actively choose Ayo over
[03:59:43] nlet and in any team
[03:59:45] ever um you could be like oh more Hydro
[03:59:47] from off field okay but your nlet will
[03:59:49] be better on field than literally any
[03:59:51] other character ever like that's that
[03:59:54] always except like you
[04:00:00] know no maybe I need to make a separate
[04:00:02] video with more in-depth like I'd rather
[04:00:04] play Child changling although I don't
[04:00:07] even know if the math backs that but I'm
[04:00:08] pretty sure but it's like I'm talking
[04:00:10] about ioto right not IO of all the pros
[04:00:13] and cons of the two cuz I don't want to
[04:00:15] be that guy who's coping at least they
[04:00:17] both suck when it comes to the fact that
[04:00:18] the enemies
[04:00:19] canori I think that she's in pretty bad
[04:00:22] situation right now arino just got
[04:00:24] announced as the upcoming 4.6 unit I
[04:00:27] asked you guys if you're pulling for her
[04:00:29] and well the results speak for
[04:00:31] themselves I mean we even have nalet and
[04:00:33] Kaza coming up in the second phase so
[04:00:35] she's really in a tough spot and look I
[04:00:38] personally love her play style and that
[04:00:40] mostly has to do with the fact that I
[04:00:41] love albo in a platonic way of course
[04:00:44] I'm not going to beat around the bush
[04:00:45] and pretend they don't share a lot of
[04:00:46] similarities but as I said before I'm
[04:00:48] also not ready to declare that albo is
[04:00:50] Power crep by chori because if you
[04:00:52] haven't noticed she kind of depends on
[04:00:54] other Geo units while albo can just
[04:00:56] chill out by himself and deal pretty
[04:00:58] much the same damage no matter who
[04:00:59] you're playing with unless of course
[04:01:01] we're talking about Goro who I'm pretty
[04:01:03] sure albo needs Goro though to do
[04:01:05] similar damage to chiori even without
[04:01:07] the construct like even with one doll
[04:01:09] chori I could be wrong but I'm pretty
[04:01:11] sure albo needs Goro to do the same
[04:01:13] damage that chori does does alone with
[04:01:15] no constructs and then with a construct
[04:01:16] sure just does more so like really well
[04:01:19] especially at C6 and sure albo still
[04:01:22] wants that Geor residence to function
[04:01:24] well but at least half of his damage
[04:01:26] potential isn't locked behind the
[04:01:27] requirements for someone to produce a
[04:01:29] construct and here the thing I don't
[04:01:31] like CH but also 100% of his damage
[04:01:33] potential is locked behind the fact that
[04:01:35] a boss enemy could step on your [ __ ]
[04:01:37] flower and then you're useless but you
[04:01:39] know Fair behind the requirements for
[04:01:41] someone to produce a construct and
[04:01:43] here's the thing I don't like ch's first
[04:01:45] constellation at all feels a bit of a
[04:01:47] bit that she can have two dolls when
[04:01:48] playing in double GE Navia why is a z
[04:01:51] Jeff mod in my
[04:01:55] chat L watch yourself you're on thin
[04:01:59] ice the Virgin timeout was abolished
[04:02:01] last summer
[04:02:03] oh wait I can call people virgins sorry
[04:02:06] sorry sorry sorry I just wanted to know
[04:02:08] all right all
[04:02:09] good but on the other hand this also
[04:02:12] kind of makes her look not that
[04:02:13] ridiculous ous when compared to albo but
[04:02:15] for what it's worth I think she's a fun
[04:02:17] character and again subjectively
[04:02:19] speaking she has one of the best burst
[04:02:21] animations in the game in my humble
[04:02:22] opinion but there's definitely some
[04:02:24] questionable things happening with her
[04:02:26] and I will most likely make a follow-up
[04:02:29] video in the future to share my post-
[04:02:30] released thoughts anyway thanks for
[04:02:32] watching the
[04:02:36] video no way he used ushi before
[04:02:41] EQ definitely some questionable
[04:02:44] burst animations in the game in my
[04:02:47] humble opinion but there's definitely
[04:02:49] some I mean okay I'm going to be honest
[04:02:51] I'm like I don't dude I'm too picky with
[04:02:52] my footage like I reset a million I
[04:02:54] don't blame someone for not wanting to
[04:02:56] reset a thousand times I reset so much
[04:02:58] cuz if I do that I get tilt I almost
[04:03:01] re-recorded the entire EOC clear cuz
[04:03:03] halfway through I realized you can do
[04:03:04] one physical normal before bursting to
[04:03:06] get an extra stack so you can do another
[04:03:07] charge attack in your combo and I didn't
[04:03:09] want to like I didn't want to like like
[04:03:11] not show that and then get comments
[04:03:13] about that
[04:03:19] anyways um but yeah thanks for
[04:03:26] watching wait let me write something
[04:03:30] down
[04:03:42] um
[04:04:08] um okay sorry I was
[04:04:12] yapping

[04:19:59] Discerning pal water comes in Melly
[04:20:01] flavor many
[04:20:06] [ __ ] the problem with star like Star
[04:20:09] rail is that I'm going to have to gear
[04:20:10] more before I stream cuz half the time I
[04:20:13] I spend more time gearing in Star than
[04:20:15] actually playing the game because I have
[04:20:16] to like swap relics between
[04:20:18] everyone I'm not even joking by the way
[04:20:21] it takes like it actually takes me
[04:20:22] longer to
[04:20:27] gear cuz I don't have as many
[04:20:35] relics get better relics dude look at
[04:20:38] dude I have look I
[04:20:41] have like these are all plus 15 okay
[04:20:43] that wasn't even that many
[04:20:44] actually okay but I have a lot like look
[04:20:47] these are all five stars I have a lot
[04:20:49] it's just like dude dude like it's it's
[04:20:51] hard to get
[04:20:52] like I don't
[04:20:59] know whale oh also I could have the

[05:00:10] last
[05:00:11] wait you're right I haven't done this
[05:00:14] much thinking for a long time hello Lisa
[05:00:16] big fan if you're that interested why
[05:00:19] don't you join in on the fun sure thing
[05:00:22] what do you say want to help me relive
[05:00:24] my days as why she winging at me it's
[05:00:27] not polite to P off your work on other
[05:00:29] people you know is that a no then it
[05:00:32] would be quite the rare opportunity to
[05:00:34] work together and of course I'm as you
[05:00:37] probably know the kns of Fon have long
[05:00:40] conducted research on Alchemy but most
[05:00:44] of that research has been carried out in
[05:00:45] a laboratory setting the Public's
[05:00:48] knowledge of alchemy is quite minimal
[05:00:50] which means that up to this point most
[05:00:52] of our research and discoveries have
[05:00:54] remained quite distant from people's
[05:00:56] daily lives we've put a lot of MOA into
[05:00:59] the research but have very little to
[05:01:01] show for our effort noting this
[05:01:03] disconnect Jean decided to start an why
[05:01:05] are you mentioning Jean of our labor
[05:01:07] with no one mentioned her and you
[05:01:09] brought her up that is introducing them
[05:01:11] to several different kinds of alchemical
[05:01:13] Potions all right cool potions we I
[05:01:16] already have some experience with this
[05:01:17] work even though I usually work at the
[05:01:20] library aering was also one of
[05:01:23] specializations back in the day so Jean
[05:01:26] thought was the best person for the job
[05:01:28] but to create potions all in all let's
[05:01:31] start so are you asking us what if we do
[05:01:34] the rangle no wor alchemical practices
[05:01:36] are agre or disagreed but there's still
[05:01:39] a disconect between our resarch and I
[05:01:41] wish there was a genin rang guess the
[05:01:44] crit value guess the
[05:01:46] ICD shop that way we can I mean there is
[05:01:50] a but kill two Pig with one well of
[05:01:52] course and who better to take on this
[05:01:55] job than one of the most accomplished
[05:01:57] among our ranks that's me when I was at
[05:01:59] the Academia students would often help
[05:02:01] out with each other sure my cuties
[05:02:03] wouldn't dude gagel would actually help
[05:02:05] me learn there's a lot of like abilities
[05:02:07] where I'm not like I forget the [ __ ]
[05:02:09] Elemental application nice and all but P
[05:02:12] still thinks you're just looking for a
[05:02:13] way to I Like Your Enthusiasm when all
[05:02:16] our work is done I will personally see
[05:02:18] to it that you're generously rewarded
[05:02:21] all of the initial preparations have
[05:02:22] been made so let's head to the
[05:02:28] shop this is the worst event wait really

[05:02:57] thing wow looks like you've made a lot
[05:02:59] of preparations already did you do this
[05:03:02] all by yourself it was a group effort
[05:03:05] Jean secured the initial funds to open
[05:03:07] the shop ALB and Crow provided the
[05:03:10] ingredients and equipment needed to brew
[05:03:12] the potions it's like a GTA MC business
