[00:08:16] anyways your resid is giving me anxiety
[00:08:18] okay this is okay thank you chatter for
[00:08:21] pointing out the main reason I'm making
[00:08:22] this video number one yes obviously I
[00:08:25] want my EO to get good artifacts but
[00:08:27] another reason why I'm doing this is so
[00:08:29] people stop getting anxiety on the
[00:08:31] smallest things okay it's pixels on a
[00:08:33] screen for my my account is getting
[00:08:35] ruined by the second not yours okay so
[00:08:37] you can feel better about your account
[00:08:39] when you see me lose out on efficiency
[00:08:42] does that make sense no no it doesn't
[00:08:45] Okay uh okay let me rephrase that look
[00:08:48] listen it's look I promise okay here's
[00:08:50] my promise I will spend this resin as
[00:08:53] fast as possible actually here's what
[00:08:54] we're going to do okay to uncap the
[00:08:56] resin AAP as fast as possible we are
[00:08:58] going to connect resin spend it all on
[00:09:00] the new domain get a husk set foro and
[00:09:03] we're going to only check the artifacts
[00:09:04] when our artifact inventory is full when
[00:09:06] it's full we're going to check them all
[00:09:09] uh then what yeah then we'll level which
[00:09:13] ones are good we'll destroy the ones
[00:09:14] that are bad for Moa like the lowlevel
[00:09:16] ones and then after that we'll just go
[00:09:18] again until we spend all our
[00:09:20] resin yeah and we'll do some gambas on
[00:09:22] Twitch you guys can vote for your
[00:09:24] [ __ ] what do you think we'll do a
[00:09:25] Gamba which set will be better you know
[00:09:28] um so my base is 86 682 right like
[00:09:32] there's nothing really I can destroy
[00:09:33] other than like this but uh yeah

[00:12:10] go all right we're done let's go uh I'm
[00:12:13] going to condense resin and then we're
[00:12:14] going to go spend all of
[00:12:16] it how do you seen the amount of mints
[00:12:19] in the Cat Island what do you mean the

[00:12:38] funny okay uh let's uh let's go okay
[00:12:42] okay listen I I feel like I just want to
[00:12:44] specify this right now before I continue
[00:12:46] with this uh like
[00:12:48] video I know I could have done it slowly
[00:12:51] and not cap the resin but it's just if I
[00:12:54] do it this way then people don't think
[00:12:55] I'm bullshitting you know you got like
[00:12:57] the factor of like oh my God he actually
[00:12:58] did it like this guy massive massive uh
[00:13:03] I don't want to see massive Co in a
[00:13:04] YouTube video that's kind of cringe what
[00:13:05] do I say you know what I mean it's just
[00:13:08] it's different look listen it's
[00:13:10] different if you have 2000 resin and you
[00:13:13] see the 2000 resin versus someone who's
[00:13:15] like boys today wait that was a bad
[00:13:17] accent versus someone who says okay I
[00:13:19] promise I'll spend 2,000 just wait till
[00:13:22] the end of the stream right it's
[00:13:24] different but if
[00:13:26] I never mind I don't have to explain
[00:13:28] this let's just go I don't have to
[00:13:29] explain this it's fine it's fine uh okay
[00:13:33] so the final bit of prep we need to do
[00:13:35] is decide who the [ __ ] we're bringing to
[00:13:37] this domain uh we wanted a team that
[00:13:39] does this fast cuz I don't want to be
[00:13:40] here all night and we
[00:13:43] also uh one
[00:13:48] sec yeah it has to be fast and it also
[00:13:50] has to be a
[00:13:51] team
[00:13:53] that I mean clear as
[00:13:56] well that needs friendship yeah that's
[00:13:58] what I meant to say
[00:13:59] so here's what we're going to do we have
[00:14:00] to Runo we have to run Goro for
[00:14:02] friendship then we can run diona as our
[00:14:04] healer where is she boom and then the
[00:14:07] last L can be literally
[00:14:09] anyone the last one is is anyone
[00:14:11] probably another Gio right
[00:14:19] so uh I guess
[00:14:22] El anemo to group oh yeah actually yeah
[00:14:27] yeah you guys are right cuz domain's
[00:14:29] kind

[00:16:12] be spending this resin for like
[00:16:15] literally 2 hours so it doesn't matter
[00:16:18] if the intro is 10 minutes or 1 minute
[00:16:20] we're still going to be here for [ __ ]
[00:16:21] 2
[00:16:23] hours at least I get to learn how to

[00:16:35] okay look look let me tell you something
[00:16:37] okay I'm always I'm a big fan of OAB
[00:16:39] boonga
[00:16:40] okay and the thing with being an oaba

[00:16:44] like it's just better in every way like
[00:16:47] would you
[00:16:48] rather okay let me put it this way would
[00:16:51] you rather be someone who optimizes
[00:16:53] every rotation and thinks about every
[00:16:55] particle they catch or who can just
[00:16:57] smash smash things by spamming a mouse
[00:17:00] button exactly
[00:17:05] exactly okay I I feel like okay I need
[00:17:08] to change some stuff uh I feel like
[00:17:12] diona does nothing cuz I don't need a
[00:17:17] shield I know ten0 like I watched this
[00:17:20] stream a bit I know 1010's like I can't
[00:17:22] play EO without a shield because I die
[00:17:24] so unlucky for him but I feel like I'm
[00:17:26] just too talented like I feel like I
[00:17:28] should run like benett or something like
[00:17:30] cuz Bennett would give me so much more
[00:17:32] damage I don't know I don't know uh yeah
[00:17:36] we might swap that also Kaza shouldn't
[00:17:40] really I'm going to give my Kaza like oh
[00:17:43] what the [ __ ] all right I'm running
[00:17:45] attack Sands I don't
[00:17:46] care no you can't run your kazua on crit
[00:17:51] I watched a Zio video all right
[00:18:01] thought you needed daa for friendship
[00:18:03] yeah but I'm not friends with
[00:18:14] diona Chad she's like [ __ ] six bro my
[00:18:17] friends have to be at least I don't want
[00:18:20] to okay this actually dude I I feel like
[00:18:23] it's weird if you're friends with people
[00:18:24] that aren't okay there can be an age Gap
[00:18:28] but I feel like if I'm not comfortable
[00:18:30] making jokes around them cuz they're too
[00:18:31] young I don't want to be friends with
[00:18:32] them I'm not I'm talking in general like
[00:18:34] it's just
[00:18:35] weird is that make make sense does that
[00:18:38] not make
[00:18:39] sense it's like the people on Twitter
[00:18:41] that put like it's like the people on
[00:18:43] Twitter that are
[00:18:45] like I'm 13 but let me educate you it's
[00:18:48] like no I don't have to [ __ ] listen
[00:18:49] to you bro you're a [ __ ] embryo why
[00:18:51] do I care about your opinion you're 12
[00:18:53] I'm sorry that was toxic but
[00:18:56] like anyways
[00:18:59] it's like I don't know I don't
[00:19:05] know just say 18 plus I mean like I
[00:19:08] don't know it doesn't I'm not going to
[00:19:10] [ __ ] ID people that I'm just friends
[00:19:12] with I don't like I don't care it's just
[00:19:13] if you're a [ __ ] toddler there's a
[00:19:19] difference please send me your
[00:19:22] [Music]
[00:19:27] passport why do you need friendship you
[00:19:29] don't it's just cuz there's no end game
[00:19:31] content so the true end game content of
[00:19:32] this game is getting Level 10 friendship
[00:19:34] with everyone uh except with child so if
[00:19:36] you play uh tartaglia and you get him
[00:19:39] friendship 10 you actually unlock a
[00:19:40] shirtless skin so that's coming it's not
[00:19:43] out yet but it's coming I talked to
[00:19:44] mihoyo about it I called uh Mr John
[00:19:46] mihoyo who's the John mihoy sorry who's
[00:19:49] the CEO and he told me yeah we'll get
[00:19:51] that we'll get that for
[00:19:53] you
[00:19:55] it's the true end game is the friends
[00:19:57] who made along the way true bro I mean
[00:20:00] that's true dude like I've made friends
[00:20:02] from every game I quit you know so like
[00:20:04] that's the only thing that stuck with me
[00:20:06] after the game so it is the true end
[00:20:15] game press e inside your Q I did I did
[00:20:18] it right before it ended also why are
[00:20:20] you back seating a [ __ ] domain
[00:20:22] clear it's a domain clear
[00:20:27] bro
[00:20:38] fore it's likeo I don't have to [ __ ]
[00:20:41] try hard on everything I
[00:20:47] do I wish there was a way to
[00:20:50] like I don't know make your
[00:20:53] combo I feel like I wish I could stop it
[00:20:56] like I know you can stop it at any time
[00:20:58] I don't know how to explain this
[00:21:01] sometimes when you're charge attacking I
[00:21:02] like just want it to end but it doesn't
[00:21:03] and then I'm like
[00:21:06] sad cuz like the stacks you get are like
[00:21:08] kind of random cuz it depends on what
[00:21:10] attacks ushi that makes sense I don't
[00:21:12] use my burst should I use it
[00:21:18] it how much ER for Bennett 200 or
[00:21:22] more literally as much as you can get
[00:21:25] but 800 is what you're looking for 180
[00:21:27] is fine too bro die
[00:21:29] I should just use my burst holy
[00:21:31] [ __ ] dude all
[00:21:37] right dude it's slow cuz I didn't use my
[00:21:39] burst I wanted to save it all right
[00:21:42] whatever go
[00:21:43] next let say 800 180 whatever dude let
[00:21:47] me caffeinate I'm
[00:21:53] tired okay mods mods okay here's what
[00:21:56] I'm going to do I don't pay you guys so
[00:21:58] you're okay you're allowed to say
[00:21:59] no uh but since we're going to do big
[00:22:03] gambas at the end of the stream or no
[00:22:06] not that like when my artifact inventory
[00:22:08] is filled up we'll do big gambas until
[00:22:10] then if you want to let chat you know
[00:22:12] participate parasocial relationship be
[00:22:14] like Oh brao I'm a [ __ ] part of the
[00:22:16] stream yeah and like spend their Channel
[00:22:19] points we can do a gamb on every domain
[00:22:21] since I'm spending condensed resin you
[00:22:23] can make the gamb like two of the same
[00:22:25] set or two different right and then we
[00:22:27] can gamb on every run and then a big
[00:22:28] gamb at the end now if you don't want to
[00:22:30] do that cuz you're a lazy mod that's
[00:22:32] fine I understand because I don't pay
[00:22:34] you anyways uh but
[00:22:37] yeah was that British accent my British
[00:22:40] accent is actually amazing okay
[00:22:41] sometimes it's a little off but usually
[00:22:43] it's really good like I'm not even
[00:22:45] trolling like I'm being honest like I'm
[00:22:47] it's actually
[00:22:52] insane okay sometimes it depends on the
[00:22:55] word it depends on the word oh [ __ ] my
[00:22:57] over
[00:23:04] so now what are we doing spending 2000
[00:23:08] resin also dad I saw you [ __ ] I don't
[00:23:11] know why but you like Don know 10 bucks
[00:23:13] when I was offline I don't know if you
[00:23:15] wanted me to bring it up or not but I
[00:23:16] appreciate it so thank you and you
[00:23:17] didn't have to get booba yeah I got him
[00:23:20] wait watch this I can get him without
[00:23:21] getting out of my chair watch wait [ __ ]
[00:23:24] okay I
[00:23:25] can't yeah I can't I need a Bluetooth
[00:23:28] headset
[00:23:29] all right say hi look at him he's so
[00:23:34] chunky this is what I want a oi this is
[00:23:36] what I wanted guoba to be okay if they
[00:23:38] release a guoba plushy other than the
[00:23:40] monstrosity that they already sell it
[00:23:42] should be this just a big chuny boy that
[00:23:45] you can hug he's so soft it's actually
[00:23:47] insane this was the best investment of
[00:23:49] my life like
[00:23:52] unironically cuz now people come to the
[00:23:54] stream like look people like okay let me
[00:23:57] see what Z's stream is all about about
[00:23:59] and then they see [ __ ] how are my
[00:24:01] earphones okay wait dude I hate this I
[00:24:04] need a [ __ ] Bluetooth
[00:24:06] headset okay wait wait one sec yeah
[00:24:10] people come to the stream they're like
[00:24:12] okay let's see what let's you know let
[00:24:13] me click on the stream right they click
[00:24:15] on the stream and then they see booba
[00:24:17] right and then they're happy because
[00:24:19] booba is so cute that their brain
[00:24:22] releases endorphins that's not the word
[00:24:25] dopamine happiness what's the what's the
[00:24:27] what's the what's the the thing anyways
[00:24:30] that right and then they're happy cuz of
[00:24:32] bua but then they think it's cuz of me
[00:24:34] right and then since they think it's cuz
[00:24:36] of me they associate their happiness
[00:24:38] with Z's stream so they think I made
[00:24:40] them happy when in reality it was just
[00:24:42] Boba all along so then I keep using my
[00:24:44] EO for my que that guy was right so then
[00:24:47] they keep coming back to the stream
[00:24:49] because they think I'm a good streamer
[00:24:51] but in reality it was just
[00:24:55] waa okay but you guys have to get okay
[00:24:57] you have to understand everyone has to
[00:24:59] understand I am trying to become Anto
[00:25:01] main but I've played probably 2,000
[00:25:05] hours of gench impact if not more and
[00:25:08] every single other character in the game
[00:25:10] with like one exception wants to use
[00:25:12] their e first and then their burst okay
[00:25:14] so for EO I have that muscle memory
[00:25:16] engraved in my [ __ ] mind and it's
[00:25:18] hard to like overcome it okay you have
[00:25:20] to understand it's it's going to take a
[00:25:23] while it's going to take a [ __ ]
[00:25:27] while what's your profile picture it's a

[00:28:49] making this weird now the men's models
[00:28:52] are ugly as hell what huh have you seen
[00:28:56] Shia calling Shia ug
[00:28:58] bro Shia okay Shia is literally guys
[00:29:03] look at how tall Shia is look at this EO
[00:29:06] is so tall that he's the same height as
[00:29:08] shiao if you guys think this is Cat by
[00:29:11] the way this has 36k likes so you know
[00:29:13] it's true they're literally the same
[00:29:14] they're the same so they're both super
[00:29:17] like tall and Chad
[00:29:20] characters I'm as tall as EO by the way
[00:29:22] like
[00:29:30] wait did U reply again let me
[00:29:38] see he said I made you
[00:29:51] stronger okay I don't know if you guys
[00:29:53] okay I don't know if people in my chat
[00:29:55] like follow adsu especially on Twitter
[00:29:58] but I feel like is it just me or is he
[00:30:00] always talking about taking a [ __ ] like
[00:30:02] I I swear the all 96% of his tweets or
[00:30:06] him talking about his toilet I why do I
[00:30:08] know more about his toilet than I do
[00:30:09] about my own [ __ ] family
[00:30:16] bro oh I think I disabled Tex speech on
[00:30:19] donos I got to reenable that cuz someone
[00:30:20] I saw a message but it didn't get uh red
[00:30:30] always
[00:30:33] constipated uh stanle donated $2 for a
[00:30:37] metor who can only get one would you
[00:30:39] suggest iar ganu and which do you prefer
[00:30:43] Okay g is better but I think I recommend
[00:30:46] aaka more as a pull like AA is probably
[00:30:49] the only DPS that I think is like okay
[00:30:52] it depends on your account and on who
[00:30:54] you like playing more cuz they're both
[00:30:55] really good but
[00:30:58] G is better but AA doesn't need good
[00:31:01] supports so G wants a good team either
[00:31:04] melt or freeze comy but it's a lot
[00:31:07] harder to make a good freeze team for
[00:31:09] ganu than it is to make a good freeze
[00:31:12] team for AA cuz AA can literally use
[00:31:14] like Barbara Kaaya sucros who are all
[00:31:16] like basically free to play other than
[00:31:20] sucros uh I love you despite Dono
[00:31:23] Walling 1500 bits Bob I've never done
[00:31:25] that
[00:31:28] you're as tall ASO and is as tall
[00:31:31] Asia is smoke socks smoke if I'm as tall
[00:31:35] ASO and we know we know that eo's tall
[00:31:38] that's just a fact then by proxy I'm
[00:31:46] tall doesn't AA outp has G you always no
[00:31:51] like I like okay right now I would
[00:31:52] rather use AA than G in the current
[00:31:54] Abyss okay basically when Mona and venti
[00:31:57] don't work
[00:31:58] you should go aaka as like a freeze team
[00:32:01] but if Mona ventti work G is the best
[00:32:03] and then if you're like okay but aa's
[00:32:05] scalings are broken whatever then you
[00:32:06] just run aaka in the G team and then you
[00:32:08] have a g freeze plus aaka uh and then
[00:32:12] kokomi instead
[00:32:14] of Mona okay let me
[00:32:18] put G doesn't feel good in the C base
[00:32:20] yeah free like it's kind of copium I
[00:32:22] mean melt G you still
[00:32:25] good hello I'm kind of new to the game
[00:32:27] how do you get so much resin
[00:32:29] okay okay here's the worst part this is
[00:32:32] a first time chat from a viewer so I
[00:32:34] know they're actually I know they're
[00:32:36] actually they mean it okay
[00:32:39] look look I'm sorry I normally you're
[00:32:43] not supposed to have this much resin I'm
[00:32:44] just doing a thing where I'm spending
[00:32:46] all my resin how do
[00:32:48] I I'm sorry you're not supposed to the
[00:32:51] only way to get this much resin
[00:32:52] basically you get you get fragiles from
[00:32:55] playing the game I've been stockpiling
[00:32:57] them I decided to use them all today to
[00:32:59] make my EO as sexy as possible uh and so
[00:33:03] I have a a lot of resin no I didn't even
[00:33:06] spend that much money like I I did like
[00:33:08] yeah sure I did like three refreshes or
[00:33:09] whatever but I didn't
[00:33:12] like I didn't like it was all from
[00:33:14] fragiles which you get for free or
[00:33:16] battle pass I
[00:33:17] guess battle

[00:43:51] watch crit rate it guarantees a crit
[00:43:53] piece there you go
[00:44:05] attack percent k w no but attack percent
[00:44:07] is usually good right everyone wants
[00:44:09] attack sends so you can't be like oh

[00:44:17] perfect piece but you give a good piece
[00:44:19] you

[00:44:25] 100k how much did that [ __ ] E do myi
[00:44:27] did like actually
[00:44:48] 100K whoi stronger than Dr burst wait
[00:44:51] okay I actually I know they're like
[00:44:53] similar but what's the scaling I
[00:44:54] actually am curious J is like 800 right
[00:44:57] and then II's like
[00:44:59] 600 835 level 9 what's
[00:45:02] mine yeah dude it's like a mini Jong Le
[00:45:05] burst but that doesn't take 6 seconds of
[00:45:08] a cut scene to
[00:45:10] [ __ ]
[00:45:19] cast how much ER is myo on too much just
[00:45:22] cuz we're doing domains uh with only a
[00:45:25] like normally I'd run trip Tri Le Geo
[00:45:28] and like but when I'm doing a domain I'm
[00:45:30] just chilling and I don't have to think
[00:45:31] and play perfect so I like to run like
[00:45:33] too much ER so I'm on 150 which is too
[00:45:36] much but
[00:45:44] yeah cuz the thing is like I only like
[00:45:47] the thing with myo is since I don't
[00:45:50] really have that many husk pieces I
[00:45:52] don't I can't pick like the perfect
[00:45:53] amount of er yet so I have this one that
[00:45:55] has an ungodly amount and then my
[00:45:57] [ __ ] sand that has 30 like I I have
[00:45:59] there's no in between it's either 30 or
[00:46:00] zero and zero is not enough and 30 is
[00:46:02] too much so for now we just run like too
[00:46:08] much foster go bur my foster is
[00:46:16] ruined how does II do more damage on my
[00:46:18] Jong Le
[00:46:20] uh there's a lot of factors that go go
[00:46:23] into it like it depends how you're
[00:46:25] building the [ __ ] characters right
[00:46:27] like you're strong the usually be like
[00:46:29] HP or on a non-offensive set stuff like
[00:46:34] that your weapon all that
[00:46:50] [ __ ] you constellate him you won't need
[00:46:52] ER okay I'm not going to [ __ ]
[00:46:54] constellate my EO just for ER

[01:02:02] if you spam high in my chat the time it
[01:02:04] takes you with the mobile delay plus
[01:02:06] your dog [ __ ] internet delay to see me
[01:02:09] responding high is going to take [ __ ]
[01:02:11] 6 minutes to where you're still going to
[01:02:13] be spamming High by the time I'm saying
[01:02:17] this okay look we'll do a little social
[01:02:19] experiment chat press one if you're

[01:02:23] phone watch this
[01:02:26] okay you see the people pressing one
[01:02:28] right now you see there some people
[01:02:29] pressing one they're all liars because
[01:02:31] the people watching on their phone will
[01:02:33] only hear this in like 30 minutes so
[01:02:35] when we're done spending all our resin
[01:02:36] maybe we're doing an abyss clear when
[01:02:38] you see a random SE of ones that's when
[01:02:40] you know the real mobile people are
[01:02:41] actually
[01:02:42] here I'm kidding I'm kidding kid it's
[01:02:45] actually not that bad they made it
[01:02:47] better they made it
[01:02:52] better it's not that bad anymore but
[01:02:54] like sometimes I'd like let's say I talk
[01:02:56] in like to another stream right I talk
[01:02:57] to like zff and we'd be like he'd like
[01:03:00] be roasting me and then by the time it
[01:03:02] takes me to hear the roast and respond
[01:03:04] he's like wow Zio real quiet or like wow
[01:03:07] he didn't answer or something it's like
[01:03:08] dude I'm just on mobile it takes a
[01:03:12] while my mobile internet is faster than
[01:03:15] my than my computer wait really what the
[01:03:17] [ __ ] I guess it depends
[01:03:20] yeah that's fair
[01:03:32] wait do I still have
[01:03:33] condensed I
[01:03:35] do people still typing
[01:03:38] one that's [ __ ]
[01:03:45] funny okay now I don't know I don't know
[01:03:47] who's bullshitting so

[01:04:09] thank bro can this guy
[01:04:15] die
[01:04:20] it's yeah I feel bad for Australia ping
[01:04:23] like in most games like some games have
[01:04:24] an Australia server but most of them
[01:04:26] don't and usually when you have to
[01:04:28] connect to like I don't know I guess
[01:04:30] Asia server or something you have like
[01:04:31] the worst thing like it's you basically
[01:04:34] have bad ping in every game from what
[01:04:35] I've seen I know there's probably
[01:04:36] exceptions but like the people I would
[01:04:39] play games with that are from Australia
[01:04:41] would usually be like okay I can't do an
[01:04:43] Australian accent but just imagine I
[01:04:45] were they'd be like yeah I'm on [ __ ]
[01:04:46] 200
[01:04:49] [Music]
[01:04:53] ping Brazil is worse is it don't you
[01:04:57] guys have like I guess for genin you
[01:04:59] don't but a lot of I feel like a lot of
[01:05:01] there's a lot more games that have like
[01:05:03] South American server versus Australia I
[01:05:06] I don't know I might be wrong
[01:05:20] but are there just going to be people
[01:05:22] randomly typing ones through the whole
[01:05:24] [ __ ] stream
[01:05:26] that's so
[01:05:28] funny oh that's so
[01:05:33] good just like random oh dude that's so
[01:05:36] funny people watching on no
[01:05:40] Kia all right someone said I used E
[01:05:42] before Q let's roll the dice roll the
[01:05:44] dice roll the dice all right one to six
[01:05:48] you're
[01:05:51] lucky check Discord DMS uh no
[01:06:01] you can just ask in
[01:06:03] chat is it unless it's urgent if it's
[01:06:06] urgent it's [ __ ]
[01:06:14] emergency I youed even for Q again no
[01:06:17] one say anything you're not allowed to
[01:06:18] say anything if you say anything you
[01:06:19] will get
[01:06:20] banned someone said Q before E okay one
[01:06:23] second throw the dice good luck Sparky
[01:06:26] the pro all
[01:06:31] right dude it's a habit when when all
[01:06:34] you do in get is always use your E
[01:06:36] before you Q so you get the particles
[01:06:37] it's just ingrained in your
[01:06:39] memory also sometimes I use it cuz I
[01:06:42] actually need the particles you
[01:06:45] know look I'll get better at it I
[01:06:47] promise I'll get better
[01:06:56] honestly especially Shia it's like Shia
[01:06:58] if you don't cuz Shia and EO are like
[01:07:00] similar in play style right but if you
[01:07:02] don't spam e on Shia before your burst
[01:07:05] you're just throwing my EO the C6 want
[01:07:07] to let you know oh uh I don't think I
[01:07:09] need to use a C6 EO account if I want to
[01:07:12] I'll let you know but yeah I mean it
[01:07:15] seems fun I just don't want to like be I
[01:07:18] don't want to like do it and then want
[01:07:19] to wh
[01:07:23] you how does he have that much resin
[01:07:25] yeah so when you use your Twitch Prime
[01:07:26] subscription on uh the Zio Channel you
[01:07:29] actually just get like a ton of resin
[01:07:32] that's how it works I'm kidding I think
[01:07:34] you can actually get resin with twitch
[01:07:35] Prime No Cap though I'm actually not
[01:07:36] even trolling okay I'm not I'm not
[01:07:38] baiting Subs I don't care if you sub or
[01:07:39] not but I'm pretty sure twitch Prime if
[01:07:43] you link your Amazon Prime to your
[01:07:44] Twitch you can actually get like fragile
[01:07:46] resin every month or something I'm not
[01:07:47] even I'm being honest you don't have to
[01:07:49] use yourself yes you get a free
[01:07:51] subscription to any streamer every month
[01:07:53] but I'm not even talking about that I
[01:07:54] didn't even bring it up okay you guys
[01:07:56] brought it
[01:07:57] up but yeah you get a fragile and like
[01:08:02] Primos red horn or Skyward red horn oh
[01:08:06] on Ula uh probably Skyward if you need
[01:08:09] the ER I haven't done the Cals on it but
[01:08:11] I'm pretty sure Skyward should be better
[01:08:13] if you need the ER if you don't need the
[01:08:15] ER is probably bad um but yeah
[01:08:28] no cond Dan
[01:08:41] type alternates between fragil and
[01:08:43] Primos yeah I I claimed uh I claimed two
[01:08:46] I
[01:08:50] think why do I always lose the Gamba I
[01:08:53] know me too
[01:08:55] cuz I'm always a
[01:08:57] Believer oh chat okay tell me if this is
[01:09:01] smart or not okay be honest what if I
[01:09:03] played Believer by Imagine Dragon when
[01:09:06] I'm checking my artifacts which means
[01:09:08] the Believers are going to win which
[01:09:09] means we're going to get a good artifact
[01:09:11] tell me that's not the biggest
[01:09:13] brain no okay all
[01:09:16] right all right okay there's not a
[01:09:18] single yes there's not one person all
[01:09:19] right okay

[01:09:25] got we literally almost three just from
[01:09:27] one [ __ ] one like half a stream all
[01:09:30] right POG I should probably use another
[01:09:32] character it's just like it feels like
[01:09:35] when I'm not using like kazua I feel as
[01:09:37] like my domains just take so much
[01:09:41] longer is there one else I can use that
[01:09:43] like groups enemies I I already have
[01:09:45] friendship 10 veny and
[01:09:50] [ __ ] stop saying Shia my sh's obviously
[01:09:53] friendship 10
[01:10:11] Jean Jean's friendship

[01:10:15] does everyone me to use Ryden in
[01:10:17] this we can try her which friendship is
[01:10:19] she okay we can we can try Ryden I just
[01:10:22] I feel like the Dom is going to be a lot
[01:10:24] slower
[01:10:27] okay I'm honestly tired of my Ryden
[01:10:28] being like mediocre okay I'm tired I'm
[01:10:30] sick and tired of it I want a cracked
[01:10:32] Ryden I want my Ryden to be like like

[01:10:40] that's what I want your reaction to be
[01:10:42] okay
[01:10:46] uh what's my
[01:10:49] ratio
[01:10:51] 7026 that's not
[01:10:54] bad she probably wants more crit rate
[01:10:58] but
[01:11:03] uh wait I have another attack sense I
[01:11:05] have another attack sense I know I do I
[01:11:08] know I do I know I do okay I don't I

[01:11:20] lied whatever it's good
[01:11:23] enough is that not broken it's good but
[01:11:25] okay here's the thing I feel like every
[01:11:27] time I like use someone else's account
[01:11:29] and use Ryden or I play on like other I
[01:11:32] see other people user their burst will
[01:11:34] do like 17 million and then I use her
[01:11:36] and it does like a good amount but just
[01:11:38] not as good it's probably because of
[01:11:40] engulfing lightning or whatever but I
[01:11:42] don't know attack s and attack goit
[01:11:44] viable yes but usually you only want
[01:11:46] like one like you'd rather go Electro go
[01:11:49] if you have attack sounds but double
[01:11:51] attack can be fine
[01:11:57] oh yeah C2 oh that's why I [ __ ] I

[01:14:24] we were just seeing the damage and then
[01:14:26] you guys K wed so there it is still I
[01:14:30] didn't do 4K that was the E my burst
[01:14:32] didn't do 4K
[01:14:38] whatever there was literally a 120k I
[01:14:41] don't know what to say yo auon here to
[01:14:44] find my favorite unkillable streammer
[01:14:47] true I am uh I've never died on like on
[01:14:51] stream I've only died off stream for
[01:14:52] Content like sometimes I'll like or like
[01:14:55] okay sometimes I'll like let's say on
[01:14:57] stream I'll like there'll be a clip of
[01:14:59] me dying but it'll be for Content so for
[01:15:01] example I'm doing the abyss it's too
[01:15:03] easy but I want to seem relatable to
[01:15:04] people that are struggling okay I don't
[01:15:06] want I don't want you to come into the
[01:15:07] stream and then be like wow this is
[01:15:09] unrelatable he's like basically clearing
[01:15:12] without any effort content that I have
[01:15:14] been stuck on for weeks or months okay
[01:15:17] so what I do sometimes is I'll just like
[01:15:19] let myself get hit against like Malu Ki
[01:15:21] or whatever just to make it seem
[01:15:23] relatable okay but um yeah that that's
[01:15:28] just like it's just it's a ruse you know
[01:15:31] it's like just it's just like for
[01:15:33] Content I'm just trying to
[01:15:40] heal it's true it's
[01:15:42] true I've never actually died on
[01:15:46] stream you're saying your viewers are
[01:15:48] bad at the game I'm not saying bad it's
[01:15:50] the socioeconomic conditions they are
[01:15:52] under you know like sometimes okay look
[01:15:55] if if if let's say you're watching the
[01:15:56] stream and you're like ar25 and you
[01:15:58] don't have access to a credit card okay
[01:16:01] that is going to hinder
[01:16:02] you okay okay yo that was one that was
[01:16:05] 169 guys that was good
[01:16:08] damage that was good D that was that was
[01:16:10] good that was good that was good that
[01:16:13] was good that was good that was good
[01:16:14] that was good that was good that was
[01:16:15] good that was
[01:16:21] good why not pulling red horn I think I
[01:16:24] will but drink another stream cuz we
[01:16:26] have a lot to do today I don't want to
[01:16:27] like okay here's the thing if I do
[01:16:29] everything I want to do in one stream
[01:16:31] then I'll be out of content and I'll be
[01:16:33] a [ __ ] I'll be streaming like
[01:16:35] valerant or like Cookie Run Kingdom
[01:16:37] which is fine I'm all for streaming
[01:16:38] other games but I'm trying to spread out
[01:16:40] the genin content you
[01:16:47] know yeah melon C2 Ryden is really
[01:16:53] good uh uh what should I use I like I
[01:16:57] have like too many abilities I can
[01:17:08] use dude I'm actually cracked in cook
[01:17:10] your on Kingdom like you guys think you
[01:17:12] guys think you guys think I'm joking but
[01:17:13] I'm actually cracking that
[01:17:22] game no one asked all right
[01:17:29] ET on Goro
[01:17:31] guide uh I haven't
[01:17:33] started probably tomorrow I'll record
[01:17:36] all of it the only thing I need to test
[01:17:39] with Gobo is basically how much damage
[01:17:42] he deals but if from what I've SE like
[01:17:46] from my go like from my testing it seems
[01:17:48] like his damage is copium like correct
[01:17:50] me if I'm wrong but it doesn't seem like
[01:17:52] his damage is good okay and if his
[01:17:54] damage isn't good I'll probably say some
[01:17:56] [ __ ] like okay look like you're probably
[01:17:59] better off just leveling his talents and
[01:18:01] not investing in him and then saving
[01:18:02] your resources like that might be the
[01:18:04] focus of the guide like okay if you're
[01:18:06] C4 you can literally [ __ ] build him
[01:18:08] for healing cuz he's not doing damage
[01:18:09] anyways and if he's not C4 you can just
[01:18:12] give him er no bless isn't optimal like
[01:18:14] I'm just doing whatever but you can just
[01:18:15] give him like er and then whatever
[01:18:17] defense crit for your five and like not
[01:18:20] care if his damage is
[01:18:23] low mention exile yeah I know yeah Exile
[01:18:25] like Exile is pretty good husk two-piece
[01:18:28] with emblem two-piece is okay for husk
[01:18:30] is good but that's only for your own
[01:18:31] damage so I don't like it uh and no
[01:18:33] blast is
[01:18:34] viable yo Yulie what's up welcome to the
[01:18:37] stream when are we playing
[01:18:38] Val actually I probably can't tonight
[01:18:40] cuz it's late but soon why crit rate
[01:18:44] okay so crit rate is not for the damage
[01:18:45] I want to specify it's for the fav you
[01:18:47] don't need crit rate I honestly think I
[01:18:50] don't know if I'm trolling by saying
[01:18:52] this but I think a healing bonus ciret
[01:18:54] might actually be VI at C4 like I
[01:18:56] honestly think making him a Healer cuz
[01:18:58] he does no [ __ ] damage is a decent
[01:19:00] idea but then you don't have enough crit
[01:19:02] rate for five so you need sub stats yeah
[01:19:05] I use it yeah like I I tested it a
[01:19:08] bit um during my actually the the the EO
[01:19:12] clear that's in my current video had a
[01:19:14] Goro on healing
[01:19:20] bonus I don't know I might title the
[01:19:21] video like [ __ ] don't waste your
[01:19:23] resources or some [ __ ] cuz
[01:19:27] you can still mention the best options
[01:19:28] for damage yeah for sure I'm going to
[01:19:29] say like you know if you want damage go
[01:19:31] husk right
[01:19:36] obviously [ __ ] I used e okay I wasn't
[01:19:39] going to use Q that's why I used
[01:19:43] e you want to Triple crowno probably
[01:20:00] I was a YouTube frog until 15 minutes
[01:20:01] ago and you're so different on stream
[01:20:03] what do you mean I'm literally the same
[01:20:04] watch hey what's up guys today we're
[01:20:06] going to talk
[01:20:07] about I feel like I feel like no dude
[01:20:11] I'm just like okay look here's the thing
[01:20:14] here's the thing YouTube Z is like more
[01:20:16] calm cool and collected okay is your
[01:20:20] voice a little different I mean I feel
[01:20:21] like
[01:20:22] I I feel like I have three voices okay
[01:20:26] this is me just like screaming cuz I'm
[01:20:28] talking loud to my stream then I have a
[01:20:30] normal talking voice and YouTube voice
[01:20:34] there's like three Z voices okay
[01:20:35] actually that's not true there's like
[01:20:36] YouTube voice but then there's also
[01:20:39] like it depends where my mic is cuz if I
[01:20:42] talk here and if I talk into the mic it
[01:20:44] makes me sound completely
[01:20:52] different YouTube Z is the impressed
[01:21:05] true wait has it always been the same
[01:21:07] set
[01:21:15] damn bro what is this guy doing okay I
[01:21:19] just want to have a talk guys can you
[01:21:20] just can I just can you someone just
[01:21:24] give me
[01:21:25] the phone number of whoever made
[01:21:27] designed this enemy whoever decided to
[01:21:29] not only make the rift hounds but also
[01:21:32] put them in the abyss just give me their
[01:21:34] name like I just want to talk I just
[01:21:36] want to
[01:21:37] talk Mr John Rift
[01:21:44] Hound I'm out of
[01:21:50] condensed is EO the same power level as
[01:21:53] Sha uh I think Shia's better but I'm not
[01:21:56] sure it's
[01:21:57] early I just think Shia's not like I
[01:21:59] think Shia's better than most people
[01:22:01] think Shia is so I guess it depends how
[01:22:03] good you think he
[01:22:09] is they have a similar like play style
[01:22:12] though I guess like stay on field for a
[01:22:14] while do AOE
[01:22:18] damage I think they're the same Shia
[01:22:20] shorter no they're literally the same
[01:22:22] height they're both tall
[01:22:25] if you love sh why don't you marry him
[01:22:26] cuz he's not real what do you mean you
[01:22:28] think I
[01:22:30] wouldn't like okay I'd still be that
[01:22:32] wouldn't make me okay just because I'd
[01:22:34] marry sha that doesn't make that like
[01:22:35] I'd still be straight I just just to
[01:22:37] clarify we would just we would live
[01:22:40] together but we wouldn't do anything
[01:22:41] like it's different like we'd be
[01:22:44] homies it's dude I could be in an open
[01:22:48] relationship I could we' just be like
[01:22:52] whatever doesn't matter I don't know if
[01:22:54] they say that
[01:22:59] next topic I mean whatever all
[01:23:23] right try I've been making playlists
[01:23:25] soon I'll have I'll have multiple
[01:23:27] playlists on stream I'm making a classic
[01:23:29] playlist I got a a like a emo playlist I
[01:23:32] got a rap playlist I got a [ __ ] metal
[01:23:35] playlist soon he soon CH I just need
[01:23:40] a I don't know what else I need
[01:23:53] actually like your genin helper role in
[01:23:55] Discord okay I feel so bad about that
[01:23:57] cuz I dm' people like yo I I told people
[01:24:00] DM me for the helper role and then I
[01:24:02] just I answered them but I just never
[01:24:04] followed up cuz I so okay cuz there's
[01:24:07] some people that I can tell they have
[01:24:09] game Knowledge from the way they're
[01:24:10] talking and like their messages I know
[01:24:13] that they would be a good helper and
[01:24:14] that like they're Theory crafters and
[01:24:16] [ __ ] right like that they you know but I
[01:24:19] wanted to make a test to make it even so
[01:24:21] it's like okay I can test people's
[01:24:22] knowledge but I'm too lazy to make the
[01:24:23] test cuz I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm
[01:24:25] going to do and I don't want to just ch
[01:24:27] like pick people that I think have game
[01:24:30] knowledge you know so I wanted to make
[01:24:33] like
[01:24:33] a I don't know I should probably just
[01:24:37] ask my mods to do it no cap but I'm
[01:24:39] going to do it I'm going to do
[01:24:43] it for circular defense running five
[01:24:46] crit unless you have enough on your
[01:24:52] subs just make a cahoot
[01:24:55] yo cahoot music [ __ ] slaps oh my God
[01:24:58] cahoot music was the best part of my
[01:25:00] [ __ ] high school
[01:25:04] experience D we should play kahoo
[01:25:21] music dude the best is when you would
[01:25:23] leak the [ __ ] Cahoots in your group
[01:25:25] chat and then have a bunch of random
[01:25:26] people join that like weren't in the
[01:25:28] class that was the
[01:25:34] best cot stream
[01:25:58] you could read threads in the genin
[01:25:59] Discord rdit asking for advice and ask
[01:26:02] how they would advise the person yeah I
[01:26:04] was thinking of making like mock like
[01:26:06] account reviews or like qu general
[01:26:08] questions it doesn't you don't have to
[01:26:09] be like the most know knowledgeable and
[01:26:11] also like I feel like part of being a
[01:26:14] good I mean anything I guess is
[01:26:17] like yeah I guess like for being a
[01:26:20] helper it's like if there's anything
[01:26:21] you're unsure of you can literally just
[01:26:22] like look it up or like research it or
[01:26:25] use the resources in like [ __ ] my
[01:26:28] Discord kaching Main's the [ __ ] I
[01:26:30] don't know any community so like having
[01:26:34] it be a form of questions even if like
[01:26:37] like people are asking like okay if it
[01:26:38] were to be like you know a few questions
[01:26:40] or like a quiz or whatever couldn't
[01:26:41] people just cheat it's like yeah but
[01:26:43] like what is cheating it's [ __ ]
[01:26:45] researching the answer that you don't
[01:26:46] know it's not like a bad thing right
[01:26:49] like if you if you if you don't
[01:26:53] know okay let's say you don't know the
[01:26:54] exact amount of energy recharge you need
[01:26:56] for like bet okay having to look it up
[01:27:00] will just make you know it like it's
[01:27:01] you're gaining knowledge it's not
[01:27:08] like tell that to my
[01:27:11] professor I mean like okay I'm not
[01:27:13] talking about like cheating in general
[01:27:15] this is just for like a genin thing but
[01:27:17] a lot of the times even with test it's
[01:27:19] like some [ __ ] some of like the niche
[01:27:21] exception things like okay I I'm in I
[01:27:24] I'm in law school right a lot of our
[01:27:26] questions on exams are like the weird
[01:27:28] exceptions on a specific thing that's
[01:27:31] like the most Niche [ __ ] that you're
[01:27:32] never going to have to know but it's an
[01:27:34] exception so you have to know it exists
[01:27:35] okay and it's like for that type of
[01:27:37] exception if you're in that situation
[01:27:39] you would [ __ ] look it up you'll look
[01:27:41] in your [ __ ] articles you'll look in
[01:27:42] the [ __ ] online like you'll find the
[01:27:44] specific like Niche case you don't have
[01:27:46] to [ __ ] know it by heart but anyways
[01:27:49] it's fine I'm
[01:27:52] Ming tldr is good no no I'm kidding I'm

[01:28:35] cheating that means you find Yan fun I
[01:28:37] like yon I was very frustrated when I
[01:28:40] made her first video though I remember
[01:28:42] the abyss I don't know what it was but
[01:28:43] it was annoying like clearing the abyss
[01:28:45] whatever the old that Abyss was with yon
[01:28:48] I remember it being
[01:28:49] annoying but I mean I like the

[01:31:06] still typing one it's been like an hour
[01:31:09] oh it's so
[01:31:19] [Music]
[01:31:20] good yeah we're going to get so many
[01:31:22] kokomi artifacts just from like grinding
[01:31:29] husk actually wait how is our artifact
[01:31:31] inventory not full we've spent 1,600
[01:31:34] resin bro
[01:31:36] what okay let's just
[01:31:39] [Music]
[01:31:40] look oh my
[01:31:42] god dude how many [ __ ] artifacts wait
[01:31:46] look at all the new ones holy [ __ ] bro
[01:31:58] you play other games says Troy OverWatch
[01:32:02] yes I am
[01:32:04] actually I was an OverWatch player then
[01:32:07] the game
[01:32:07] [Music]
[01:32:09] died so many artifacts and they're all
[01:32:11] bad they're going to be good so okay
[01:32:14] here's the thing number one we we've do
[01:32:18] we've let me restart number one we've
[01:32:21] spent so much resin that we're
[01:32:23] guaranteed good pieces number two in the
[01:32:25] past streams they've all been dog [ __ ]
[01:32:27] so now is time statistically that our
[01:32:30] luck catches up to us so that's like a
[01:32:33] double that's a double win right
[01:32:38] there but yeah I mean I've been trying
[01:32:41] to stream more variety but I mainly just
[01:32:43] stream genin I also play play valerant
[01:32:45] OverWatch and
[01:32:47] like uh that's about it I play Cookie
[01:32:51] Run Kingdom I like epic 7 a bit that
[01:32:53] that
[01:33:17] counts gambler's fallacy no it's not
[01:33:20] really a fallacy think about it think
[01:33:21] about it just think about it are you
[01:33:23] thinking okay think about it if you keep
[01:33:26] getting unlucky at some point through
[01:33:29] sheer volume of statistics and
[01:33:31] probabilities your luck is going to
[01:33:33] catch up to you and you're going to get
[01:33:34] lucky the reason why it's a fallacy in
[01:33:36] the real world is cuz you have a finite
[01:33:39] amount of money so if you keep doubling
[01:33:41] up and keep gambling eventually you're
[01:33:42] going to run out of money and get [ __ ]
[01:33:44] right but since we have an unlimited
[01:33:46] amount of resin eventually just by doing
[01:33:49] so many domains our luck is going to
[01:33:50] catch up and we will even it out and get
[01:33:53] luck
[01:33:54] let me give you guys an example okay
[01:33:56] roughly a [ __ ] over a year ago now I
[01:33:58] got this piece everyone said oh no
[01:34:00] [ __ ] ways are you're so lucky brao
[01:34:03] and everyone thought I was the luckiest
[01:34:05] artifact in the world okay but now it's
[01:34:07] been a year of me getting [ __ ] artifacts
[01:34:09] to where my luck has evened out okay I
[01:34:11] don't have a good C okay I have a lot of
[01:34:13] good circlets but I don't have a perfect
[01:34:16] one yet 99% of people that redeem
[01:34:18] account review on this channel have a
[01:34:20] perfect ciret that they Flex my best
[01:34:22] ciret is is like [ __ ] is
[01:34:25] like it's like that it's not bad it's
[01:34:28] good but that's my best and I'm ar60
[01:34:30] almost okay so my point is at some point
[01:34:35] your luck evens out
[01:34:37] like it's not a fallacy anymore trust
[01:34:42] copium who is he talking
[01:34:45] to all right
[01:34:48] whatever why are you Ming I'm not you're
[01:34:51] Ming

[01:36:43] EO and then just never have to use my
[01:36:46] burst SC blade best in SL for Bennett uh
[01:36:50] no but it's like sometimes the best like
[01:36:54] it's the best when you need ER but
[01:36:56] having a higher base attack is better if
[01:36:59] you can get enough ER in your
[01:37:14] subs you almost banned someone for
[01:37:16] talking about physical EO okay
[01:37:20] but okay hear me out C6 Bennett
[01:37:24] Crimson Witch of flames EO with singu
[01:37:27] applying Hydro you vaporize every hit
[01:37:30] pyro is better than Geo therefore
[01:37:32] physical uh pyroa will be the
[01:37:47] best what's more fun to play Shia or EO
[01:37:49] I don't [ __ ] know I mean I still
[01:37:51] think I like Shia the most but they're
[01:37:52] both fun depends on you do you like oaba
[01:37:55] or do you like [ __ ] I use e do you like
[01:37:58] oaba in the air or oaba on the ground I
[01:38:01] think they're both fun if you like one
[01:38:03] you'll probably like both like Shia's
[01:38:06] still my favorite character but like I
[01:38:07] like e a lot so up to
[01:38:14] you would Ali flash be good for Benn
[01:38:16] yeah Ali flash is insane it's
[01:38:18] like I I want to say it's his best
[01:38:21] weapon just cuz it's similar to Aquilla
[01:38:22] and it's not five star so you can either
[01:38:24] not get aola or use your AA on someone
[01:38:26] else but yeah it's it's right under like
[01:38:30] aola it's really
[01:38:37] good you don't even follow your own
[01:38:40] guide okay look all
[01:38:42] right it's hard okay it I I I just have
[01:38:46] Auto never mind I don't have to explain
[01:38:48] myself I want to play some busted

[01:40:02] you we've been over it like if I'm going
[01:40:05] to start a raid to a wholesome Channel
[01:40:07] instead of typing blankies you're the
[01:40:09] guy that types try hard I I don't want
[01:40:11] that precedent once you start blanking
[01:40:13] the raids and start being a wholesome
[01:40:16] productive member of chat then you'll

[01:40:48] happen you can't it's engraved in
[01:40:50] everyone's muscle memory or like other
[01:40:51] way around it's engraved in muscle
[01:40:53] to do the opposite so it's just not a
[01:40:55] true combo it's just wrong it's
[01:40:59] misinformation that's
[01:41:06] true what powers do VIPs get except
[01:41:09] bonking VIPs can't even Bonk that's mods

[01:46:31] bro at least the song
[01:46:33] slaps song's actually so
[01:46:47] good best P oh I
[01:46:50] used I wasn't going to use my que I was
[01:46:52] actually waiting that's that's why I
[01:46:53] want it
[01:46:57] to uh I'll do this suggest the video
[01:47:00] thing I got to rename that cuz I feel
[01:47:02] like I I made it suggest a video but
[01:47:05] it's never actually just been a video
[01:47:06] it's always a song so I can make it
[01:47:07] cheaper for just a song suggestion like
[01:47:09] 75k for a song suggestion is kind of a
[01:47:11] scam so I might change
[01:47:19] it oh yeah I'll play this all Rex after
[01:47:22] this
[01:47:32] song request nightbot no I don't want
[01:47:34] like an actual song request cuz what if
[01:47:36] someone Rick rolls me you know so I have
[01:47:38] to like I'll do it
[01:47:41] manually you've been saying you would
[01:47:42] change it for 30 streams look okay
[01:47:45] it new viewers won't know that so you
[01:47:48] don't have to bring it up and if you're
[01:47:49] an old viewer and you've been here a
[01:47:51] while then you know you know me you know
[01:47:53] what's going to happen in like a month
[01:47:55] like a
[01:48:17] year when is the go guide coming out
[01:48:21] uh I don't know I I'm never really in a
[01:48:24] rush for the fourstar after the festar
[01:48:26] but it should be a day like I'm making
[01:48:28] it tomorrow can I also edit and upload
[01:48:31] it tomorrow I don't know so it'll either
[01:48:33] be out tomorrow or in two days I also
[01:48:35] made a ningan guide fully edited but I
[01:48:36] haven't uploaded it yet so it's probably
[01:48:38] going to be Goro then a stream vid then
[01:48:41] ning
[01:48:42] Wong then like another stream vid and
[01:48:44] then top five teams or some [ __ ]
[01:49:04] think I need it now it it'll come I
[01:49:12] promise I have to like I'm not
[01:49:17] healing I have a crystal I
[01:49:20] Shield why do I do that charge attack
[01:49:24] [Applause]
[01:49:39] can you try Petra ning Wong with
[01:49:40] thrilling tales on a EO Geo team no cuz
[01:49:43] Petra doesn't work for the Geo you can't
[01:49:45] like crystallize Geo I think maybe
[01:49:47] unless you're fighting a Geo slime but
[01:49:48] in general you can't so Petra n like
[01:49:51] Nang can be fine with the reason I
[01:49:53] didn't mention her is cuz she's worse
[01:49:54] than like the other GE options other
[01:49:57] than like fav codex ning Wong uh but
[01:50:00] yeah you can't run you can't run
[01:50:03] Petra the solar pear B slot on ninglang
[01:50:07] no it's good but F okay so five star
[01:50:10] weapons are the best then the four stars
[01:50:12] in terms of the four stars honestly
[01:50:15] widsith Pearl and doo are all like
[01:50:18] really really close like they're
[01:50:19] basically the same depending on how you
[01:50:21] player uh for like SP spamming charge
[01:50:24] attack Doo can be better wiith is better
[01:50:26] for quick swap or like a more how I use
[01:50:29] ning Wong and then solar Pearl is also
[01:50:32] really
[01:50:33] good and it gets better
[01:50:36] than uh the other one
[01:50:43] refinement let me heal my
[01:50:48] Goro is memory good yeah so five stars
[01:50:51] are her best all all five
[01:50:57] good Wii is only better than five stars
[01:50:59] if you're like trying to one shot
[01:51:07] something [ __ ] up putting albo before
[01:51:09] Ito yeah I think albo is like a really
[01:51:13] good support
[01:51:16] foro probably the best one after
[01:51:21] Goro best foro Shang Ling benett Jong Le
[01:51:24] wait
[01:51:25] what that wasn't a question are you
[01:51:27] saying that's ito's best team I mean it
[01:51:29] could it's it's probably like maybe just
[01:51:32] cuz [ __ ] uh actually no itto doesn't
[01:51:34] get any energy there there's no reason
[01:51:36] to run etto in that team right cuz
[01:51:38] you're running shanglin benett Jong Le
[01:51:39] who's going to give particles to your EO
[01:51:42] literally no one
[01:51:45] right unless you're Ono on five
[01:52:10] d Ling will do the damage yeah then why
[01:52:11] the [ __ ] are you running EO it's like
[01:52:14] saying like it's like saying like uh I
[01:52:16] mean okay in that team you would run
[01:52:18] like Goro or something you would run
[01:52:19] someone that actually generates
[01:52:20] particles more so than Jong but in that
[01:52:23] team it's like saying okay ito's best
[01:52:24] team is guu Mona venti and then you just
[01:52:27] don't swap intoo right it's like but
[01:52:31] yeah I mean I think EO Nationals like
[01:52:34] not Gio is pretty good wait why am I
[01:52:36] doing the
[01:52:42] [ __ ] all right let's play the song
[01:52:43] that someone requested what is this it's
[01:52:45] called Let The Living
[01:52:50] beware looks like a huta I don't know
[01:52:52] there's a Hut
[01:52:58] ghost [ __ ]
[01:53:03] slaps yeah this is a fish jam I agree
[01:53:05] that's the perfect emote for this
[01:53:40] you play liar Rick Roll the [ __ ] is liar
[01:53:43] Rick
[01:53:44] Roll like when you Rick Roll with the
[01:53:46] [ __ ] the genin liar in
[01:53:50] game it's actually five head
[01:53:56] R1 serpent R5 wi line I have a a weapon
[01:53:58] ranking in my
[01:54:00] video like I we we like zff did the Cals
[01:54:04] so you can go compare if you want to
[01:54:07] know Serpent's busted though oh we're
[01:54:11] done kind
[01:54:20] of wait let's go see
[01:54:23] all right my throat hurts I'm trying to
[01:54:28] hydrate okay uh I think we're so we're
[01:54:31] almost done let me just see where we're
[01:54:33] at so right now we have what is it we
[01:54:36] have 120 resin so three condensed now
[01:54:38] we're out of
[01:54:40] resin and wait how many artifacts did we
[01:54:43] get oh my God we're almost we're not
[01:54:45] even full dude I thought we going to get
[01:54:46] a full like three
[01:54:47] times
[01:54:49] huh uh well
[01:54:55] there's so many [ __ ]
[01:54:57] artifacts all right it's fine we're
[01:54:59] almost done we're almost
[01:55:06] done did I make a goo guide tomorrow
[01:55:24] can't wait for you to get scammed I
[01:55:28] won't check your EO friendship after
[01:55:30] that's actually a good idea I wonder if
[01:55:32] we actually got friendship on him or
[01:55:33] like how much we
[01:55:49] got Chad I wasn't being Pogo I was just
[01:55:52] waiting to get healed it wasn't it
[01:55:54] wasn't anything sus I was literally
[01:55:56] waiting to get healed okay I used my e
[01:55:59] there before the Q so that I got
[01:56:00] particles during the animation and also
[01:56:02] to snapshot the defense buff so if I
[01:56:03] were to swap Theo and burst too early I
[01:56:05] wouldn't snapshot the buff which is why
[01:56:07] I waited and while waiting I was like
[01:56:09] you know might as well Chuck the
[01:56:11] cow so it wasn't a mistake
[01:56:33] yeah I think Goro could use for Petra
[01:56:35] but it's like when like most teams
[01:56:38] unless you're running like
[01:56:41] a you know EO Goro and then ning Wong or
[01:56:45] B you're probably running a Geo team in
[01:56:47] Goro so you're probably not going to
[01:56:49] want for Petra but yeah for Petra is
[01:56:51] really good
[01:56:52] if you're running a team that runs like
[01:56:56] other elements you
[01:56:59] know not Gio yeah
[01:57:03] exactly it's like the niche teams right
[01:57:05] like that type of Goro
[01:57:16] team the thing with Exile is I feel like
[01:57:19] no one's actually going to [ __ ] level
[01:57:20] an exile set like it's good
[01:57:22] but I always have like trouble
[01:57:24] recommending it I cuz like I feel like
[01:57:26] no one's going to [ __ ] level Exile
[01:57:29] but like it's
[01:57:37] goodra's clunky to use yeah but it
[01:57:39] doesn't matter like even if you don't
[01:57:43] have 100% up time on the set when all
[01:57:44] the Alternatives suck balls it's like
[01:57:47] it's fine you know like Goro doesn't
[01:57:50] really have good stats anyways
[01:58:16] usually with Petra though like I like to
[01:58:18] use it on the DPS if that Mak sense like
[01:58:21] it's hard to do that but like I think
[01:58:23] for Petra ning Wong DPS is actually good
[01:58:25] if you're running like official singu or
[01:58:27] something cuz
[01:58:29] like you're losing out on like two glad
[01:58:32] in order to buff your [ __ ] let's say
[01:58:34] Electro damage by 35% like I think it's
[01:58:36] actually
[01:58:37] good if it's like a
[01:58:43] yeah dude think about it think about it
[01:58:45] ning Wong taser for Petra thrilling
[01:58:47] tails
[01:59:05] actually wait I wanted to skip this cuz
[01:59:06] it was like let go to the second phase
[01:59:10] no okay I won't skip it I'm sorry I'm
[01:59:12] sorry chat got angry I'm sorry I wanted
[01:59:14] I wanted more epic music cuz it's the
[01:59:17] LA it's our last one chat it's our last
[01:59:20] one what if okay what if our last resin
[01:59:23] is like the good one like what if okay
[01:59:25] what if I check one more artifact I know
[01:59:27] it's cheating but I feel like the last
[01:59:29] one has to give us
[01:59:35] some
[01:59:37] [ __ ] dude okay chat
[01:59:44] Fu okay chat how many gifted to plus 20
[01:59:47] this all right it's fine it's fine it's
[01:59:49] fine it's fine it's fine fine on on that
[01:59:52] note wait one sec on that note we're
[01:59:55] done zero resin left well
[01:59:58] two uh yeah I was capped for a while but
[02:00:01] it's okay it's for Content so let's see
[02:00:03] how much 2000 resin got us and if we
[02:00:06] want to cry ourselves to sleep or if
[02:00:08] we're going to be happy honestly I think
[02:00:09] the odds of us not getting a good piece
[02:00:11] are so slim that I'm already happy
[02:00:15] preemptively uh should I count how many
[02:00:17] we got okay let me count so it's how
[02:00:20] many per row seven 7 per row that's 7 8
[02:00:24] 9 10
[02:00:26] 11 14 + 7 21 22
[02:00:31] 23 + 7 30 31 32 uh 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
[02:00:39] 46 47 48 49 50 we got 50 ocean hu clam

[02:01:36] resin uh and if I don't get a good
[02:01:38] artifact set how much how many days of
[02:01:40] resin is this let me divide by 160 no
[02:01:43] you get more than 160 how much do you
[02:01:44] get per day how much you get in 24 hours
[02:01:47] wait how much how much time is it per
[02:01:49] resin I don't actually know 180
[02:01:52] uh oh okay wait 2,000 I'll bust out the
[02:01:57] wait I'll bust out the calculator 2,000
[02:02:00] divided by
[02:02:01] 180 this is 11 days worth of
[02:02:04] resin 11 days worth of resin right
[02:02:15] now I think we're guaranteed a good
[02:02:17] artifact in 11 days I'm going to be
[02:02:19] honest I think like after 11 days of
[02:02:22] resin at this point we hit pity on on
[02:02:25] artifacts like genin mihoyo has to be
[02:02:27] feeling for us you know Gamba oh oh [ __ ]

[02:05:28] but wait that's good that's the Geo
[02:05:31] damage crit rate crit damage and er
[02:05:33] that's good fog well our child is good
[02:05:37] so you go it's a good start so that's a
[02:05:40] good uh good precedent you know
[02:05:42] hopefully we won't be ending up playing
[02:05:44] sad music at the crafting table rrolling
[02:05:46] artifacts also before we check the
[02:05:48] artifacts in case you're wondering hey
[02:05:50] how much friendship did you get that we
[02:05:52] went from a bit past friendship one to
[02:05:54] three so like two levels on go and on
[02:05:58] Ido so
[02:06:05] yeah
[02:06:07] okay now what we do is what we've all
[02:06:10] been waiting for so I did this to get I
[02:06:13] spending all my resin for EO
[02:06:15] right but since we're we're going to
[02:06:18] save the best for last and we're going
[02:06:19] to start by checking the ocean set where
[02:06:21] we're probably going to get like Godlike
[02:06:23] Chi-Chi pieces for the chii we're
[02:06:24] probably not going to use um here goes
[02:06:29] nothing [ __ ] I'm scared uh let me
[02:06:32] hydrate let me hydrate cuz my throat's
[02:06:33] going to hurt after this I'm probably
[02:06:34] gonna like I'm gonna I'm going to hurt
[02:06:36] my throat let
[02:06:44] me
[02:06:46] okay okay first of all we're going to
[02:06:49] check the goblets cuz these have
[02:06:51] potential for for for clam right HP all
[02:06:54] right that's fine no it's fine we don't
[02:06:57] need oh that's really good that's really
[02:07:01] good that could be
[02:07:03] good okay oh oh it's on set that's so
[02:07:08] good
[02:07:09] okay I
[02:07:12] mean okay so
[02:07:15] man thanks for the two mon sub it's not
[02:07:19] that good cuz it's on set for Chi but
[02:07:22] Chi doesn't really need that much crit
[02:07:23] but we take it okay that's bad
[02:07:28] okay oh uh I
[02:07:36] mean uh I mean they're okay like this is
[02:07:38] on set for kokomi right it's not bad
[02:07:40] pyro goet yeah I mean they all have one
[02:07:42] crit out we'll roll them all right s
[02:07:45] yeah we'll probably just level all the
[02:07:46] good ones uh like at the end and one
[02:07:48] shot this one's not bad ER on attack
[02:07:52] all right dog [ __ ] okay that's also bad
[02:07:56] oh I mean all right it's fine it's fine
[02:08:00] H this one kind
[02:08:01] of yeah these aren't great I'm kind of
[02:08:04] looking for like er pieces too cuz it's
[02:08:06] a Healer set so something with like er
[02:08:08] and HP for KI for example isn't isn't
[02:08:11] bad okay these oh my yeah these feathers
[02:08:14] suck all right flowers uh oh okay that's
[02:08:18] that's our first like actual double crit
[02:08:21] piece other than our attack goblet
[02:08:22] that's good we take that hopefully
[02:08:25] there's more like that to come yep
[02:08:28] come I'm actually unlocking this uh ER
[02:08:31] HP em this kokomi oh that's two
[02:08:37] guys [ __ ] wait this might actually be
[02:08:39] better than our
[02:08:40] husk dude I hope we have husk pieces
[02:08:43] like like that or even
[02:08:45] better okay honestly not bad a lot of Ki
[02:08:48] pieces but mainly we're looking for crit
[02:08:50] pieces so we have this one that has
[02:08:52] potential and this one that has four
[02:08:54] stats a lot of potential and our goblet
[02:08:57] so three like super high potential
[02:09:00] pieces at least but I think we can get
[02:09:03] more in husk cuz this is what we need
[02:09:06] look at all these circlets guys if none
[02:09:08] of these circlets has a good if none of
[02:09:11] these circlets is a good crit rate or
[02:09:13] crit damage
[02:09:18] piece I will
[02:09:22] I'm not going to say anything I I'll
[02:09:23] start I will cry I will I will
[02:09:28] personally never mind we're not going to
[02:09:30] do anything okay let's check them uh
[02:09:33] crit rate that's
[02:09:36] fine oh there we go that's one that
[02:09:39] could be good dude we're getting the new
[02:09:41] Claymore for EO tomorrow and that has
[02:09:43] crit damage which means we need a crit
[02:09:45] rate circlet that's good uh this one has
[02:09:48] potential I'm going to get it to level
[02:09:49] four all the crit ones we see I'm going
[02:09:51] to get to level four just in case oh my
[02:09:54] God wait wait wait wait yo that's two
[02:09:58] one
[02:09:59] two oh my God oh my dude there's so many
[02:10:02] crits oh my God what what dude I'm done
[02:10:07] what is our luck wait how dude I promise
[02:10:10] I know people are going to see this and
[02:10:11] think I'm like super lucky I've gotten
[02:10:13] [ __ ] by this domain for like 2 weeks
[02:10:15] straight now dude oh my God okay wait
[02:10:19] okay wait yeah this one's also
[02:10:21] crit is that it okay so to be fair none
[02:10:26] of them had four stats which means they
[02:10:28] all could have been better but to be
[02:10:31] even
[02:10:32] fairer they're really good so uh we have
[02:10:35] a lot to roll okay goblets now we'll
[02:10:37] check everything and then we'll roll so
[02:10:39] goblets that sucks that sucks that sucks
[02:10:42] uh it's defense not bad defense on set
[02:10:44] for like Goro it's not bad uh wait
[02:10:49] that's good Gio on set with crit we take
[02:10:53] that okay that sucks that sucks that
[02:10:56] sucks he it's fine we got a good goblet
[02:10:59] one good is all we want okay this is
[02:11:02] where I this is what might get me hard I
[02:11:06] didn't mean to say that reset don't put
[02:11:07] that in the video this is where I'm like
[02:11:10] intrigued if that makes sense okay this

[02:15:04] complaining look at all that ER I don't
[02:15:06] need ER okay I missed crit every single
[02:15:09] time on this I was just trying to
[02:15:11] upgrade this piece and I can't other
[02:15:15] one it's not that great not bad but it's
[02:15:20] it's not great and then this one's also
[02:15:22] the same
[02:15:26] so it's good this isn't number one EO
[02:15:31] good do you guys not know who I am bro I

[02:15:35] never seen a sh better than
[02:15:37] mine this is my sh flower okay I'm
[02:15:40] trying to get an EO that looks like
[02:15:43] that it's not
[02:15:45] happening
[02:15:47] there okay anyways anyways back to on
[02:15:50] topic
[02:15:52] Hot Topic okay
[02:15:56] anyways um what was I going to say yeah
[02:15:59] so we got I mean we got a lot of pieces
[02:16:00] that have potential we got really good
[02:16:02] circlets we haven't leveled anything yet
[02:16:04] so like look for example okay look look
[02:16:07] look look you might be wondering okay
[02:16:08] well well what about this piece right
[02:16:09] why did you lock it well if this gets
[02:16:11] crit rate it is suddenly a perfect piece
[02:16:13] right it gets crit rate it has ER it has
[02:16:16] crit damage and it'll just be a good
[02:16:18] time so that is why I'm going to level
[02:16:20] all my pieces that have potential to
[02:16:22] level
[02:16:22] four yeah that's not bad I mean it's not
[02:16:25] good but it's not bad should I get this
[02:16:28] to eight CH what do you
[02:16:38] think a lot of yeps and a lot of nopes I
[02:16:41] don't
[02:16:43] know death good for EO yeah but also
[02:16:46] crit rate
[02:16:56] okay this is guys this
[02:17:01] is I mean it's not bad it's all right go
[02:17:07] next
[02:17:09] um should I just level all these
[02:17:14] flowers okay I'll level one flower for
[02:17:16] every people flower in chat
[02:17:22] okay flat defense next flower we can
[02:17:24] just do dude we can just make this into
[02:17:25] a montage of Zio rolling a bad artifact
[02:17:29] non-stop like me getting just the worst
[02:17:30] sub stats every four roll we just make
[02:17:32] that into a quick montage and it's
[02:17:38] content wow X5
[02:17:41] XP dude just give me crit man just give
[02:17:44] me
[02:17:46] crit uh this one
[02:17:57] wow
[02:18:01] X2
[02:18:05] um okay I'm going to be honest okay I'm
[02:18:08] going to be honest I would rather get a
[02:18:09] good feather than a good flower cuz cuz
[02:18:12] cuz cuz cuz cuz my my
[02:18:17] offset I don't have to explain why I'm
[02:18:19] just going to roll this
[02:18:22] okay that's not bad that's actually not
[02:18:23] bad we can keep this one we can keep it
[02:18:27] yeah we can just keep that feather we
[02:18:28] just got cuz it it's not bad it has
[02:18:30] potential uh but I'm I'm just actually
[02:18:33] not going to keep
[02:18:35] it okay yeah all
[02:18:38] right
[02:18:40] um okay guys now most of you might look
[02:18:44] at this piece and think wow that's bad
[02:18:45] right it has like like you know defense
[02:18:48] percent is fine it has crit rate which
[02:18:49] is good but the rest sucks right I would
[02:18:51] never level this I wouldn't waste my
[02:18:52] resources on this feather however what
[02:18:55] if what if it only rolls crit rate what
[02:18:57] if you close your eyes but if you close
[02:18:59] your I'm sorry what if you close your
[02:19:01] eyes and then boom the crit rate 20%
[02:19:03] that would have been a piece that had
[02:19:05] potential that we would have wasted away
[02:19:07] and thrown and okay that's not bad this
[02:19:10] isn't bad this is this isn't bad I know
[02:19:12] I know it looks it looks weird but it's
[02:19:14] not
[02:19:15] bad it's actually not bad it's not
[02:19:19] bad it's not bad guys it's not bad it's
[02:19:23] actually not bad I
[02:19:26] promise if you believe in anything
[02:19:29] believe that this artifact has potential
[02:19:31] watch this watch this give me the
[02:19:33] biggest fattest crit rate roll you've
[02:19:35] ever
[02:19:35] seen guys wait it's happening wait wait
[02:19:39] guys I'm dead I'm not even kidding this
[02:19:42] has
[02:19:43] potential praying to RNG
[02:19:48] Jesus [ __ ] uh
[02:19:53] uh it's still not bad okay let's Okay uh
[02:19:59] do we keep this what is that like it
[02:20:02] could get one more okay let's say it
[02:20:03] rolls crit rate again that would be like
[02:20:05] what 14 crit
[02:20:09] rate it could get one more 14 crit rate
[02:20:12] is the equivalent of like almost 30 crit
[02:20:14] damage which isn't bad because it also
[02:20:18] has defense
[02:20:23] okay but here's the question right
[02:20:26] people are saying plus 20 it in the chat
[02:20:28] right but I have 400,000 Mora is it
[02:20:31] really worth me spending all of my Mora
[02:20:33] on this one
[02:20:35] artifact I would argue probably
[02:20:41] not wait okay
[02:20:45] uh okay guys megal lovenia just started
[02:20:48] playing Sans on undertale we have to
[02:20:52] roll a Sands watch this we're guaranteed
[02:20:54] to get crit rate that's how this
[02:20:58] works
[02:20:59] watch this is crit rate I can feel
[02:21:03] it that's actually not bad
[02:21:10] uh go next
[02:21:13] um oh we have this guys tell me this
[02:21:16] isn't the most
[02:21:17] beautiful rotund goblet you've ever seen
[02:21:20] look at it geog goblet on set with crit
[02:21:23] damage I am so confident in this
[02:21:25] artifact being good I'm plus 15 it offer
[02:21:28] it watch watch this watch this
[02:21:31] beautiful
[02:21:33] wait there's no way man there's
[02:21:36] no there's no
[02:21:41] way okay I'm just I just want to see
[02:21:44] what it rolls next I just want to
[02:21:47] see okay all right this is
[02:21:51] I don't want to talk about that if
[02:21:53] anyone brings up the Goblet incident
[02:21:54] you're banned no one ever mentioned the
[02:21:57] Goblet just just don't uh we're going to
[02:21:59] save circlets for the end cuz our
[02:22:00] circlets are actually good uh what else
[02:22:02] do we
[02:22:04] have I mean this could be good it's a
[02:22:08] it's sure it's a low roll but you know
[02:22:10] what they say right you know what they
[02:22:13] say everyone knows what they say you got
[02:22:16] to start low to you got to you got to
[02:22:18] like you got to be the lows to
[02:22:21] appreciate the highs you
[02:22:23] know that's what they
[02:22:27] say all right never
[02:22:29] mind okay
[02:22:34] um someone said wasting MOA bro that's
[02:22:37] all we're doing okay uh you know let's
[02:22:40] uh let's let's go to the ocean set you
[02:22:42] know we're not having the greatest luck
[02:22:44] with husk but let's let's let's do some
[02:22:47] diving in the ocean you
[02:22:49] know we'll be like an astronaut in the
[02:22:52] ocean uh we're going to start with
[02:22:59] our oh okay we'll do wait what should we
[02:23:02] do Before
[02:23:06] Flowers I'm going to level this because
[02:23:09] there's a chance this anemo goblet gets
[02:23:10] like 40 crit damage and then if it does
[02:23:13] my sh is going to have like 3 [ __ ] 20
[02:23:15] million crit damage and it'll be funny
[02:23:17] so okay uh we're going to do one more
[02:23:20] just to make sure it sucks [ __ ] oh my go
[02:23:23] I hate that now I have to level it more
[02:23:25] I hate when that happens just be a bad
[02:23:27] piece or be a good piece don't be a
[02:23:29] [ __ ] middleman stupid undecisive I
[02:23:32] don't know if I'm going to be good or
[02:23:33] bad I hate this I hate that I hate when
[02:23:36] artifacts do that they're like oh I'm
[02:23:37] going to be good oh I'm going to be bad
[02:23:39] and then you just get medium rolls and
[02:23:41] you keep leveling it cuz it keeps edging
[02:23:42] you I hate
[02:23:46] it um we're just going to we're just
[02:23:48] going to level it
[02:23:56] I'm going to
[02:24:07] hydrate all right it
[02:24:16] sucks all right this one though this one
[02:24:19] this one
[02:24:21] actually okay this one cryog goblet uh
[02:24:25] on set for literally no one but it's a
[02:24:27] cryog
[02:24:28] goblet
[02:24:32] watch wait wait yo
[02:24:36] wait is this our first good piece please
[02:24:40] I'm praying please hit
[02:24:43] crit let's go wait this could actually
[02:24:47] be good I'm not even dude this could be
[02:24:50] this has
[02:24:51] potential okay I'm actually afraid to
[02:24:53] level it
[02:24:55] now we're going all the way we're going
[02:24:58] all the way we're going all the way
[02:25:00] please if there's a God out there that
[02:25:02] watches over my artifacts attack's not
[02:25:05] bad it's not that bad cuz attack is like
[02:25:08] it's good for crowd characters because
[02:25:09] you're running blizzard stayer right
[02:25:10] blizzard stayer gives you a lot of crit
[02:25:11] damage so when you have so much crit
[02:25:14] damage you start hitting diminishing
[02:25:15] returns at that point you want attack
[02:25:18] percent which is why attack percent can
[02:25:20] actually be better than crit so
[02:25:21] technically this was a perfect role uh
[02:25:24] and is not in fact me coping it's just
[02:25:26] actually good so that is a lesson I just
[02:25:29] educated you if you didn't know that
[02:25:30] you're welcome uh that is why I wanted
[02:25:33] attack you know here you go there you go
[02:25:38] yep wait what is this dude do we level
[02:25:40] this fourstar piece I I feel bad
[02:25:42] throwing
[02:25:46] it dude it looks good last roll please
[02:25:50] hit
[02:25:52] crit okay so the thing with attack right
[02:25:54] on cryo characters you're running
[02:25:56] blizzard stay right that gives you 80
[02:25:57] crit rate which is the equivalent of uh
[02:25:59] wait no 40 crit rate which is the
[02:26:01] equivalent of 80 crit damage so at that
[02:26:03] point you're hitting diminishing returns
[02:26:05] in the crit so you want attack uh which
[02:26:07] is why attack is actually the best so
[02:26:09] this was a perfect goblet kind of it's
[02:26:11] not bad it's good it's good it's good
[02:26:13] it's not amazing I mean it's good no
[02:26:15] it's good it's good I don't care it's
[02:26:16] amazing it's amazing I said it it's good
[02:26:19] I don't know why my chat is acting like
[02:26:21] this sucks this is
[02:26:22] good it's
[02:26:24] good all right uh next
[02:26:30] piece do I level an attack double
[02:26:33] crit who am I ever going to use this on
[02:26:35] literally who
[02:26:38] like the only character i' use this on
[02:26:41] is Chi-Chi but does chichi really need
[02:26:42] that much crit when she's a Healer who's
[02:26:45] running like the bubble set
[02:26:56] all right we'll
[02:26:58] see okay it got defense if this misses
[02:27:01] one roll I'm throwing it away I'm not
[02:27:03] going to be generous with this piece cuz
[02:27:04] it's like very
[02:27:07] Niche if the plus eight socks is
[02:27:11] gone Jean can use this n Jee wants an
[02:27:16] emo all right okay that was a sign it
[02:27:18] was a sign that this artifact was not
[02:27:20] meant to be I I might keep it for
[02:27:23] later actually uh no no it sucks I mean
[02:27:27] it's
[02:27:28] not I don't know well we'll
[02:27:31] see
[02:27:36] um all right we're going to level this
[02:27:40] KY of
[02:27:43] parting because there's a chance it only
[02:27:46] rolls crit damage and then we're going
[02:27:47] to be a happy
[02:27:48] boy okay 14 if I see 21 here I'll give
[02:27:52] five
[02:27:53] Subs all right unlucky you just lost
[02:27:56] five Subs rolled by Mi hoyo this can
[02:27:58] still be good
[02:28:05] though it can still be good it can still
[02:28:07] be good like like instead of 40 crit
[02:28:09] damage now it'll get 33 and honestly I'm
[02:28:14] I'm very grateful I'm someone who
[02:28:15] doesn't complain so if I get 33 crit
[02:28:17] damage I will be happy I'll be like you
[02:28:19] know what MI hoyo thank you 33 crit
[02:28:22] damage I'm not I'm not that picky I I'll
[02:28:24] take a crit damage roll here and I'll be
[02:28:26] happy I'll be
[02:28:28] grateful okay seven yeah all right yeah
[02:28:31] okay all right
[02:28:34] okay uh it's okay it's fine we're doing
[02:28:37] okay we're doing okay uh I think it's
[02:28:39] time we do I level this I feel
[02:28:44] like like when am I going to use this
[02:28:47] when am I going to use this
[02:28:56] okay what if I use okay what if I'm
[02:28:58] running albo on harbinger of Dawn and he
[02:29:00] wants a defense ciret I think this piece
[02:29:03] has potential I think this piece is is
[02:29:07] is is calling for me let's just see what
[02:29:09] it does okay let's just see let's just
[02:29:11] see how it
[02:29:13] goes
[02:29:16] uh wait what happened wait
[02:29:21] oh that was only two rolls we can do one
[02:29:23] more we can do one
[02:29:25] more one
[02:29:28] more yeah yeah one more one more it's
[02:29:30] it's already yeah there you go one
[02:29:32] more [ __ ] now I have to level it I hate
[02:29:34] this I hate when an artifacts like
[02:29:36] decent to where I have to level it but I
[02:29:39] don't want to it's like right in the
[02:29:41] middle between good and okay it's good
[02:29:43] it's good it's good it's good it's good
[02:29:45] it's good it's good when I'm done

[02:30:18] but I don't need it so I'm just going to
[02:30:19] keep it
[02:30:20] if I ever need it but it's not worth
[02:30:22] leveling to 20 it costs so much I'll
[02:30:24] only 20 it if you guys pay for the Mora
[02:30:27] I'm not guys I'm broke here okay it's a
[02:30:30] tough

[02:31:13] a good flower on this
[02:31:16] set actually crit isn't that useful for

[02:36:35] know okay all right
[02:36:38] dude I'm in pain I'm in physical pain uh
[02:36:42] it's fine cuz we got three
[02:36:44] circlets no these are old ones we got
[02:36:46] three circlets that already had crit on
[02:36:48] them there's no way three circlets can
[02:36:51] be bad in a row there is no way all
[02:36:53] three of these are bad I know you're
[02:36:55] going to be like oh you're jinxing it
[02:36:56] shut up no I guarantee at least one of
[02:36:59] these is going to be good it has
[02:37:02] to we'll start with the worst one we'll
[02:37:04] start with this one we'll start with
[02:37:05] this
[02:37:07] one honestly I don't care what stat it
[02:37:10] rolls initially because we have crit
[02:37:12] damage on it so it doesn't matter we
[02:37:14] just want it to hit crit even if the
[02:37:15] other stats suck it can still be good
[02:37:21] watch watch
[02:37:24] this let's go okay never mind
[02:37:28] I it's not bad it can still be good it
[02:37:31] can still be good dude a good circlet is
[02:37:33] so hard to get that you have to lower
[02:37:34] your
[02:37:35] standards like if it hits crit once I'll
[02:37:38] be
[02:37:39] happy it's a new set it just came out
[02:37:41] you can't have the highest standards for
[02:37:43] a new set surely if it hits
[02:37:53] all right let's just it's fine let's
[02:37:55] just forget about this uh let's pretend

[02:38:03] looks really good uh we're going to
[02:38:05] start with the crit damage one and see
[02:38:06] what happens so yeah let's just uh let's

[02:38:11] talk about it

[02:46:54] do
[02:47:05] Senora you SL yet no but I've only been
[02:47:07] live for 3 hours it's not like the
[02:47:09] stream's been that long so it's not like
[02:47:11] it's like I don't want to end like we
[02:47:12] can do more [ __ ] I just don't
[02:47:14] know if I want to spend another thousand
[02:47:16] y know
[02:47:27] but yeah mods you can uh we probably
[02:47:29] give points to doubs it's not a re it's
[02:47:31] not a roll cuz we got this so
[02:47:35] like yeah I mean it's it's clams better
[02:47:38] like Gio like dude husk got nothing husk
[02:47:41] literally got nothing we had so much
[02:47:43] potential and then it all rolled garbage
[02:47:46] so yeah
[02:47:50] [Music]
[02:47:57] never believing again bro no one's ever
[02:47:59] believing
[02:48:08] again ow
[02:48:23] level the geog Goblet from
[02:48:27] Child
[02:48:30] ah maybe we
[02:48:35] could dude I just want to get a better
[02:48:37] EO man my eo's like so close to being
[02:48:40] like
[02:48:42] nutty I have no stamina to dodge
[02:48:49] we can do the artifacts yeah we can do
[02:48:50] the strong box at the crafting
[02:48:53] table we still have rules to do
[02:48:58] [Applause]
[02:49:02] but he wanto good yet
[02:49:21] I only bet 50 points okay dude you
[02:49:24] didn't believe I told you to go all in
[02:49:25] you didn't
[02:49:33] believe I need
[02:49:41] particles okay here's the thing here's
[02:49:43] the thing my EO is going to be the best
[02:49:46] but in a bit cuz I have a good goblet
[02:49:49] and a good ciret and those are the
[02:49:51] hardest pieces to get so all I need is a
[02:49:54] good flower feather which isn't hard so
[02:49:57] it'll be soon it'll be soon just
[02:50:02] trust dude what the [ __ ] is this fight
[02:50:04] okay
[02:50:12] I it's not hard to get a flower trust
[02:50:15] okay how much resin will it take to get
[02:50:17] one flower
[02:50:24] also chat constellations don't make your
[02:50:25] character better okay when I talk about
[02:50:27] a character being good or bad it's the
[02:50:31] artifact stats I don't give half a [ __ ]
[02:50:33] about how much money you have in your
[02:50:34] bank account that you can spend on a
[02:50:36] fictional character that's not that's
[02:50:38] not considered
[02:50:52] all right cool that took [ __ ] forever
[02:50:54] but it's
[02:51:00] fine what's the tldr of today's
[02:51:03] artifacts this is the best artifact
[02:51:05] we've gotten today in 2000
[02:51:08] resin this no we got we got a good
[02:51:10] goblet we got one good goblet uh it was
[02:51:13] a cow goet but uh yeah
[02:51:23] I'm in pain I'm actually in pain I'm
[02:51:25] actually like I'm physically hurt okay
[02:51:27] what if we do strong
[02:51:31] box I mean uh what about the wanders
[02:51:34] goblet it's it's not that good it only
[02:51:36] has crit
[02:51:40] damage okay I really say it's going to
[02:51:42] be good all
[02:51:44] right all right we'll
[02:51:47] see we'll see everyone thinks the geog
[02:51:49] Goblet we got from child will be good so
[02:51:51] let's give it a
[02:51:53] go I mean it can't be worse than our
[02:51:55] other pieces
[02:52:04] so uh I mean it's not bad
[02:52:09] like it's all right it's
[02:52:13] fine I don't know why you're making me
[02:52:15] level this but fine
[02:52:21] okay all right yeah cool all
[02:52:27] right I hate this
[02:52:35] game uh on the bright side we can now
[02:52:39] convert our bad artifacts to Gladiator
[02:52:41] pieces to get a better sh it's not
[02:52:43] really going to help our EO but it it
[02:52:46] gives us a use for the ion pieces we
[02:52:49] just got that weren't that great so
[02:52:52] there you
[02:52:57] go like there's no way we get unlucky on
[02:53:00] artifacts and then also unlucky at the
[02:53:03] strong box that just won't happen we
[02:53:04] know for a fact it's just not going to
[02:53:06] happen cuz that's not how statistics and
[02:53:09] probabilities work it's just not I'm
[02:53:11] sorry I'm sorry you have to find out
[02:53:13] this way but we're only going to get
[02:53:15] good artifacts Trust
[02:53:24] um I stop throwing away crit pieces all
[02:53:28] right watch this watch this watch this
[02:53:29] watch this watch this watch I guarantee
[02:53:31] you this will make up for all the bad
[02:53:33] luck we just
[02:53:35] got uh I mean it there's potential
[02:53:47] here all I mean it's not
[02:53:50] bad not bad no this is fine it's fine we
[02:53:53] got we got a decent we
[02:53:55] got I hate I hate everything I don't

[02:54:01] it's bad
