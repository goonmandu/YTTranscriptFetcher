[00:12:18] happiness it brings like out it could be

[00:13:09] what I'm thinking but you're not allowed
[00:13:12] to laugh at me because I know I'm wrong
[00:13:13] in Japanese this sounds like yai and in
[00:13:16] English it sounded like they are like
[00:13:17] listen
[00:13:20] that sounded like a guy to me and then
[00:13:22] this sounds like [ __ ] even if an
[00:13:23] antique is priceless so I don't know who
[00:13:24] it is
[00:13:25] foreign
[00:13:27] [Music]
[00:14:15] English maybe but Japanese is not better
[00:14:17] so it can be better uh better know
[00:14:19] Candace no wait
[00:14:22] even if an end [ __ ] I don't know what
[00:14:24] kind of sounds like
[00:14:26] I actually don't know what kind of
[00:14:27] sounds like I can't lie I'm sorry
[00:14:31] you look
[00:14:32] no dude I don't know voila I don't know
[00:14:36] I actually don't know
[00:14:39] oh my God docs how do you not know who
[00:14:41] it is it's so obvious it's so
[00:14:44] [ __ ]
[00:14:48] okay I did get beta though so like okay
[00:14:50] I'm opening chat right now okay Chad
[00:14:52] listen
[00:14:54] I thought ning Wong at the time when I
[00:14:57] thought it was a male character
[00:14:58] initially I was when I saw the name
[00:15:00] Aaron I thought of Attack on Titan
[00:15:02] because I'm a stupid weeb and I was like
[00:15:03] oh a guy character I'm a dumbass I'm
[00:15:06] sorry and then I was just like okay
[00:15:07] camping I thought of ning Wong was like
[00:15:09] a camping but then after I just forgot
[00:15:12] about her
[00:15:13] uh because alphabetical order I didn't
[00:15:15] scroll down I didn't scroll down
[00:15:18] it does make sense though I I do
[00:15:20] recognize like now that I hear it I I
[00:15:22] understand I should have gotten it my
[00:15:24] bad it is what it is okay I could
[00:15:27] achieve
[00:15:28] a cheerleader
[00:15:30] throwing for Content true actually
[00:15:34] [ __ ] I should have known it
[00:15:36] um
[00:15:37] even if an antique yeah no wonder I
[00:15:41] reckon okay because back when I used to
[00:15:43] play I played in Japanese now I played
[00:15:45] English back then I used in Japanese so
[00:15:47] it makes sense this was like oh [ __ ]
[00:15:49] that sounds familiar I don't know
[00:15:52] whatever it doesn't matter ability that
[00:15:55] looks like Chong Yoon should be like day
[00:15:57] or something
[00:15:59] awesome how
[00:16:03] intellectual
[00:16:06] it's like he's just he's just like
[00:16:08] naturally gifted I would say
[00:16:12] also a few things I want to react to
[00:16:14] very quickly that I didn't even think to
[00:16:16] bring up and this should mean again
[00:16:17] stream but it is what it is let me pull
[00:16:19] them up
[00:16:22] let me pull them up
[00:16:24] so you guys can get your Clips ready
[00:16:25] give me a second
[00:16:41] thank you
[00:16:45] foreign
[00:16:55] okay two quick Gadget Clips to react to
[00:16:58] before we start rail first of all
[00:17:02] first of all
[00:17:04] I saw this I didn't watch the whole
[00:17:05] video but I saw is dogs bad at the game
[00:17:07] or is he trolling from stream and
[00:17:08] honestly W's the Jeff why Jeff for
[00:17:11] saying what he said uh not the first
[00:17:13] part was slander but the second part
[00:17:14] where it makes sense listen
[00:17:19] complicated he's under my desk right now
[00:17:22] oh
[00:17:23] is IOS on ironically bad of the game or
[00:17:25] is he trolling no stream I'm not
[00:17:28] and I'm not trolling either I'm talented
[00:17:30] it is what it is it's complicated the
[00:17:32] short answer is is it's a bit of both
[00:17:34] but it is unironically better no I'm not
[00:17:37] but listen to The Long end so that was a
[00:17:38] slander but now listen to the good part
[00:17:40] answer yes
[00:17:44] the reason why he's bad at the game is
[00:17:47] because the game punishes you for being
[00:17:49] good at the game
[00:17:50] every time I get [ __ ] by random
[00:17:53] [ __ ] it's it's because I'm so
[00:17:54] talented that it is not even
[00:17:57] keep going so there's no reason to
[00:18:00] become better true
[00:18:01] if you become better at genshin all that
[00:18:04] happens is
[00:18:06] you'll be more bored when you do the
[00:18:08] only difficult conflict true that's the
[00:18:10] reward for because true
[00:18:17] anyways
[00:18:18] also so that's clip number one clip
[00:18:20] number two
[00:18:21] clip number two
[00:18:23] clip number two
[00:18:25] um clip number two so that's good number
[00:18:27] one clip number two
[00:18:28] uh is an aspen gold video and near the
[00:18:30] end he says the following
[00:18:36] how many people
[00:18:37] are playing like ganshin impact replying
[00:18:40] some other [ __ ] game like how popular
[00:18:42] is Genji now how popular is genjun on on
[00:18:45] Twitch I'd say that's
[00:18:48] I mean this dude's got 5 000 [ __ ]
[00:18:50] viewers so that's really where a lot of
[00:18:52] the people are coming from
[00:18:54] carry [ __ ] back yes sorry I'm not
[00:18:57] gonna let it get to my head no ego I'm
[00:18:59] just saying I'm just carrying gunjin hey
[00:19:01] acknowledged by Aspen that we're
[00:19:03] carrying engine now it's like a fact a
[00:19:05] statement Hey Hey listen listen no
[00:19:07] disrespect I'm just saying it's just
[00:19:09] easy it's just easy simple equation we
[00:19:12] do be having it on our back it is what
[00:19:14] it is uh it may or may not be in my
[00:19:16] backpack it is what it is uh this is
[00:19:19] like the so my ego Arc was so my ego has
[00:19:21] been on an all-time low because it first
[00:19:23] it inflated when enviosity mistakenly
[00:19:25] called me Xiao by accident then I got a
[00:19:27] check mark on Twitter then like back
[00:19:29] when verified meant something now that
[00:19:31] it you know check marks got stolen it's
[00:19:32] called X you have to pay for it it
[00:19:34] started crumbling down now we're back up
[00:19:37] to the eagle Arc so it is what it is uh
[00:19:39] it is what it is it is what it is
[00:19:42] it is what it is it is what it is
[00:19:44] anyways I just wanted to listen let's
[00:19:47] just say like I I like let's I got Chong
[00:19:50] you know one guess that's pretty good
[00:19:57] so yeah
[00:20:00] Chad is here to keep you humble it's
[00:20:02] already gone to my head
[00:20:07] anyways let's play honka sorrow
[00:20:10] um
[00:20:10] also second Channel video it's unlisted
[00:20:12] but it's like ready to be released so
[00:20:14] you guys can have the unlisted link if
[00:20:16] you feel like manually typing it out

[00:20:23] this has been uploaded for nine days by
[00:20:25] the way nine days it just hasn't been
[00:20:28] released because I I was too stupid to
[00:20:32] just I forgot about it and now it's
[00:20:33] going to be uploaded so it is what it is
[00:20:36] um yeah it just is what it is
[00:20:40] don't be mad at me for the takes okay
[00:20:41] that's all sorry all the time
[00:20:43] wow no way you talk
[00:20:46] actually dude a 20 minute intro is

[00:21:01] where to put my camera start real I see
[00:21:02] some people putting it here I assume
[00:21:03] they're putting it here ah I mean I
[00:21:06] didn't hear but yeah Barry man those are
[00:21:08] two months and little brother there's a
[00:21:10] tier one
[00:21:15] two one
[00:21:18] time he had a one hour 20 minute intro

[00:21:25] it's not an intro if I if I'm it's it's
[00:21:27] not an intro if I'm doing things man
[00:21:30] that's not an intro like

[00:24:33] beautiful literally perfect our blade
[00:24:35] cannot even key you can't even conceive
[00:24:38] a better blade or or bronya low speed
[00:24:40] but to be one less than our blade
[00:24:42] cracked our luocha
[00:24:44] ah
[00:24:47] also I just got those also ready uh then
[00:24:51] hung in Bible lunusi also [ __ ] ready
[00:24:55] also ready and I pre-warned because I
[00:24:57] wanted to do this on stream boom and
[00:24:58] we're getting the crit rate to make my
[00:25:00] ratio look better [ __ ] this we'll get
[00:25:01] this after boom now we actually have a
[00:25:03] cracked out ratio yes sir without a crit
[00:25:06] weapon yes sir keep that in mind
[00:25:09] um
[00:25:09] Kafka we can play uh Celie we can play
[00:25:12] uh uh silver wolf kind of scuffed
[00:25:14] because usually she's on her light cone
[00:25:16] but it is what it is uh uh uh uh cracked
[00:25:18] our team Yoon ready or [ __ ] we're not
[00:25:21] playing Balu anyways everyone's ready so
[00:25:24] Bros running inertia on who on blade
[00:25:27] it's good on Den hung it's copium but I
[00:25:29] don't dude I don't have a better one
[00:25:31] listen listen I don't have [ __ ] the
[00:25:34] the space ceiling or the new set because
[00:25:36] I I only find this on stream and I
[00:25:38] haven't simulated Universe stream for a
[00:25:39] while so we have to get more bro uh
[00:25:42] where is it rutalent Arena I just don't
[00:25:45] have it right now so whatever
[00:25:48] wait it's still cracked okay he's still
[00:25:51] [ __ ] insane though what are you
[00:25:53] talking about how is this even bad it's
[00:25:55] actually insane you guys are coping if
[00:25:57] you say it's bad it's still insane it's
[00:25:59] just r2bees to be better that's all
[00:26:01] our TV should be uh this one
[00:26:03] anyways
[00:26:05] actually I'm gonna show you this is
[00:26:08] insane this is insane this is this is so
[00:26:11] good that I'm just gonna pause so you
[00:26:12] can look at it and then be like damn I
[00:26:15] feel bad now okay this
[00:26:17] okay it's not great but boots have been
[00:26:19] really hard for me so it is what it is
[00:26:21] and then we have the wrong set here but
[00:26:22] at least the sub stats are really good
[00:26:24] so what makes up for it for now and then
[00:26:26] eventually we'll get to the right set
[00:26:27] true true love w
[00:26:29] and my Blade's even better
[00:26:31] okay cool let's go
[00:26:37] difficulty one
[00:26:39] what if we play Four DPS characters can
[00:26:41] we be difficulty one with four DPS
[00:26:42] characters try to be honest
[00:26:51] yeah okay let's just do uh well I only
[00:26:53] have three that are geared
[00:26:55] [ __ ] I actually I only have three that
[00:26:57] are geared
[00:26:58] um
[00:27:00] we'll do uh
[00:27:07] four DPS and play abundance path that's
[00:27:10] actually a good take
[00:27:12] I think I'll just do hunt [ __ ] it
[00:27:17] zero skill points we'll bring a normal
[00:27:18] attacker
[00:27:20] who's a good I'm wearing silver actually
[00:27:22] she's not a DPS well actually okay I'll
[00:27:24] just then hung [ __ ] it
[00:27:25] we have two dead hunks
[00:27:28] [ __ ] it
[00:27:30] the audience journey is different this
[00:27:33] time only by a bit though
[00:27:37] why didn't I read now go through
[00:27:39] different domains to reach the end what
[00:27:42] each plane consists of different types
[00:27:43] of domains long click on the domain to
[00:27:45] view their details select the question
[00:27:46] mark button to view all domain texts
[00:27:49] combat Elite occurrence boss okay we
[00:27:51] know that we know this we know that we
[00:27:52] know this man
[00:27:55] see I told you
[00:28:03] skipping I can't dude tutorials are for
[00:28:05] people who
[00:28:07] [Laughter]
[00:28:13] okay uh let's just do you know what
[00:28:15] let's reduce damage taken [ __ ] it no
[00:28:17] that's not good
[00:28:19] well I'll do this one
[00:28:21] I want to save my money because I don't
[00:28:23] know what we need
[00:28:25] oh no this dude again wait are you
[00:28:27] talking about me did you just click on
[00:28:29] my stream to say oh no this dude are you
[00:28:31] talking about like someone in the game
[00:28:32] you might be the honest one in the game
[00:28:33] I don't know who like
[00:28:41] God plays Dice and Destiny is born every
[00:28:43] face of the audience die results in a
[00:28:46] different influence influence
[00:28:53] wait Gamba
[00:28:59] wait I don't want to go I want to go to
[00:29:01] the question mark okay
[00:29:04] can I go to the question mark no I can't
[00:29:06] don't hesitate keep going
[00:29:10] okay
[00:29:16] wait can we just win the fight again
[00:29:18] without attacking this is just how it's
[00:29:19] gonna go
[00:29:21] okay well that's just how it's gonna go
[00:29:23] all right cool our blade is losing HP
[00:29:25] though that is what it is
[00:29:29] pretty great
[00:29:37] select a combat comments form or Elite
[00:29:39] domain to really get the rewards
[00:29:40] okay
[00:29:47] like what
[00:29:49] pick a domain geez being a teacher is so
[00:29:52] hard you go read the effects yourself I
[00:29:55] don't even need you
[00:30:02] wait is this uh when a character looks
[00:30:04] videos we're gonna enemy this oh okay
[00:30:05] yeah I mean these kind of suck I mean I
[00:30:07] guess we want those [ __ ] it destruction
[00:30:22] I would lie if I told you I wasn't
[00:30:23] confused
[00:30:29] decrease by 50 cool
[00:30:33] dude okay it's literally better for me
[00:30:35] not to read for two reasons one is more
[00:30:37] entertaining two it's more fun for me
[00:30:39] like if I read everything and it's
[00:30:41] faster that's three reasons and we're
[00:30:44] over leveled for reasons
[00:30:49] do we have to actually use an attack
[00:30:50] this time
[00:30:55] oh my God free to play build you're so
[00:30:57] sorry
[00:30:59] good damage
[00:31:03] storage to subjugation
[00:31:09] wait what guess we're gonna have to give
[00:31:11] up
[00:31:20] I see
[00:31:25] because of the [ __ ] dice effect okay
[00:31:26] makes sense let's just do the boss
[00:31:30] Broden redo because the subjugation only
[00:31:32] works on combat domains or like Elites
[00:31:35] but not bosses and there was none next
[00:31:37] to us which means we can't use the dice
[00:31:39] which means we can give it up which
[00:31:41] means we get 10 Cosmic fragments
[00:31:49] boom
[00:31:55] do not be afraid
[00:31:58] uh we're gonna eat before all things
[00:32:00] that we get the buff for our ultimately
[00:32:01] this and then this
[00:32:09] he's annoying
[00:32:13] well not in level one but usually it's
[00:32:15] annoying
[00:32:16] uh these I mean I guess this is fine oh
[00:32:18] we're gonna re-roll though we have money
[00:32:20] okay cool
[00:32:24] this is probably better but [ __ ] it
[00:32:32] what just ah what just happened
[00:32:36] oh we're done
[00:32:37] okay cool
[00:32:40] this is the next plane
[00:32:44] what's your ills like on the free to
[00:32:46] play best slot
[00:32:49] uh like I heard a story one
[00:32:51] it's not fully superimposed though so
[00:32:53] we're kind of pepega
[00:32:56] wait what the [ __ ] is Adventure complete
[00:32:58] various challenges in this domain to
[00:32:59] obtain Adventure rewards okay
[00:33:02] um do I need to change my team to
[00:33:04] difficulty too wait
[00:33:06] oh no it's still one it's still one it's
[00:33:08] still difficulty one but it's a
[00:33:09] different plane okay I was like I was
[00:33:11] like I thought this was okay
[00:33:14] I was kind of afraid let's buy a Kurio
[00:33:16] because that's fun uh this is good this
[00:33:18] is also good I'm down to get money
[00:33:20] though
[00:33:22] no I like this
[00:33:28] enter a combat comments from early and
[00:33:31] immediately obtain one blessing
[00:33:33] okay
[00:33:36] [ __ ] I want to go to Adventure though uh
[00:33:38] we'll do a combat first sure
[00:33:43] this is I mean these are all like the HP
[00:33:45] one's good for blade might as well take
[00:33:47] it

[00:33:51] Kaka Kaka kaka kaka all right uh uh
[00:34:05] [Music]
[00:34:13] take this
[00:34:15] remember this is broken as [ __ ] but it's
[00:34:17] kind of boring so if we don't have to
[00:34:19] use it we won't use it uh why don't you
[00:34:21] call this round all eyes oh nice but
[00:34:23] we're going adventuring I don't know
[00:34:25] what Adventure is uh hopefully it's fun
[00:34:29] the only thing I've seen I assume this
[00:34:30] is Adventure Mode the only thing I've
[00:34:31] seen is komemos tweeted about what the
[00:34:35] [ __ ] is this
[00:34:37] there's just a bunch of Trotters
[00:34:43] I'm gonna download a Healer just in case
[00:34:45] we need it
[00:34:46] uh I don't think we will but just in
[00:34:48] case

[00:35:35] it is it's it's
[00:35:36] you know dude live and learn if I didn't

[00:35:59] whatever
[00:36:06] why the [ __ ] did I
[00:36:08] get that auto ticket I literally don't
[00:36:09] have a Healer
[00:36:24] okay I'll just make sure my second one
[00:36:25] is good uh uh just go here
[00:36:34] oh that's fine we have follow-up attack
[00:36:39] not using silly might as well switch
[00:36:40] Yeah but like it's funnier if we don't
[00:36:43] because if we break this there's a
[00:36:45] chance a lot of ticket breaks okay
[00:36:50] all right Fists
[00:36:55] I don't really care about either of
[00:36:56] these
[00:36:58] I really don't care about either of
[00:37:00] these
[00:37:01] um
[00:37:01] I mean we'll take preservations I don't
[00:37:04] [ __ ] die I guess I mean the Hillary
[00:37:05] has good support blessings whatever
[00:37:08] what does this team do it's do you don't
[00:37:10] don't sleep on it
[00:37:25] boom wait uh we don't really have dots
[00:37:29] so it doesn't matter I'm actually just
[00:37:30] gonna reset
[00:37:32] we have no
[00:37:35] okay whatever
[00:37:36] we'll take suspicion sauce
[00:37:47] okay we're just gonna skip that I don't
[00:37:49] really care who's the Boss
[00:37:53] it's too easy for us
[00:37:55] what if we break oh no there's nothing I
[00:37:57] thought there's something to break
[00:38:03] say it do not be afraid
[00:38:06] oh [ __ ] I'm so solid second ah whatever
[00:38:10] guide maker by the way
[00:38:13] it doesn't matter
[00:38:24] consequences all right cool what is this
[00:38:28] plane three how many planes are there
[00:38:32] oh we're done
[00:38:34] plus 30 Jades poggers okay that's pretty
[00:38:37] interesting
[00:38:42] oh my God is a turtle still going
[00:38:48] oh okay do you have to just do each
[00:38:49] difficulty one by one shot yeah right
[00:38:51] because there's difficulty too so I
[00:38:53] still have to do one two three four and
[00:38:54] I heard there's five so probably five
[00:38:58] yes okay
[00:39:00] what the [ __ ] is this swarm true sting
[00:39:06] all right
[00:39:07] um

[00:39:14] have these guys and then
[00:39:17] uh our wealth is not geared
[00:39:22] we'll bring Kafka because she's pretty
[00:39:24] [ __ ] it
[00:39:25] there you go
[00:39:29] you have to admit the audience that I
[00:39:31] looked pretty formal before Steven's
[00:39:33] device stepped him
[00:39:34] keep trying destruction
[00:39:39] after shooting Richard and Elite domain
[00:39:40] obtained one blessing or an extra
[00:39:42] blessing
[00:39:43] for every battle one increases damage
[00:39:46] dealt by all allies by eight percent
[00:39:49] that seems
[00:39:50] good
[00:39:52] for every victory in combat
[00:39:54] just dealt by all allies accumulated
[00:39:57] wait this seems good I don't know what
[00:39:58] the other ones are but it seems good
[00:40:05] don't be cocky be careful the higher
[00:40:06] difficulties are terrifying dude it's
[00:40:09] funnier if I'm cocky anyways and it's
[00:40:11] not like I'm gonna lose look at me look

[00:40:41] go Kafka all right
[00:40:52] sorry uh

[00:44:52] wait what happens it goes down to zero
[00:44:56] uh
[00:44:59] uh when the counter becomes negative all
[00:45:01] enemy targets will enter planner
[00:45:03] disarray and will receive stat
[00:45:06] enhancement so they get buffed when I'm
[00:45:07] plotting this remote every movement on
[00:45:09] the map will increase the disruption
[00:45:10] level the higher the strong of the Box

[00:55:38] between each planes did they not
[00:55:44] once you started that thing dude that
[00:55:47] thing literally said once you start it's
[00:55:48] hard to stop oh where

[00:56:24] fire weakness okay uh deplete's
[00:56:25] toughness of every single enemy
[00:56:29] oh okay
[00:56:33] oh my God this thing is massive what the

[00:58:34] consequences our minds bear
[00:58:40] yes geez

[00:58:48] what is path space
[00:58:55] wait can I talk to the audience wait a
[00:58:57] second
[00:59:05] what the [ __ ] is this
[00:59:08] A peculiar cry suddenly comes from
[00:59:11] somewhere and you are certain it is the
[00:59:12] first suckling sound of an infant insect
[00:59:15] to the air along with it comes the
[00:59:16] melodic tone of red butterflies sucking
[00:59:18] honey from lilies
[00:59:28] chatting
[00:59:33] can you wish here no you can't [ __ ]
[00:59:37] kill my battle pass drawers though nice
[00:59:46] okay
[00:59:55] swarm disasters chapters that you've
[00:59:57] obtained are kept here

[01:00:02] what the [ __ ]
[01:00:08] how many
[01:00:09] wait do you have to why should I do um
[01:00:15] do I have to do all of them oh my God
[01:00:17] these are such good rewards dude these
[01:00:19] are so good trace materials
[01:00:22] okay
[01:00:24] how many runs do we have to do
[01:00:27] I mean it looks fought like it's been
[01:00:28] fun so far so that's good but
[01:00:36] wait what
[01:00:41] oh so I got Buffs okay so I assume for
[01:00:43] difficulty five you probably want most
[01:00:44] of these unlocked maybe not
[01:00:47] what the [ __ ]
[01:00:51] okay
[01:00:53] you get more rewards from doing this
[01:00:54] okay
[01:00:57] okay cool
[01:01:00] Central missions to complete okay
[01:01:16] I mean civilian universe is my favorite
[01:01:17] mode by far not even close so having
[01:01:20] swarm is I mean that's cool
[01:01:22] wait so
[01:01:31] [ __ ]
[01:01:38] collect all chapters of swarm disaster
[01:01:46] I mean this is Plus on artifact or Relic
[01:01:49] it's a lot of Jades
[01:01:54] [ __ ] I can't just go okay torturous
[01:02:03] well I haven't did I not get these yet
[01:02:05] does it not count as clear if I do three
[01:02:07] do I get all of them
[01:02:08] whatever
[01:02:12] no we'd have to do all
[01:02:14] I have to do I have to do one two again
[01:02:16] I mean I'll do them later I guess it's
[01:02:18] easy though I'll just do three now
[01:02:23] wait so so question
[01:02:25] so okay in order to unlock all of these
[01:02:27] right do I have to do so I have to do I
[01:02:29] have to okay when I get to five let's
[01:02:30] say right
[01:02:33] I have to
[01:02:35] do five with every path at least once
[01:02:47] that's pretty cool
[01:02:52] read I am
[01:02:55] don't make me frustrated right now man
[01:02:57] I'm gonna be angry and you don't want to
[01:02:59] see me when I'm angry
[01:03:04] okay
[01:03:18] do missions to unlock them okay so I I I
[01:03:21] know about okay I know these are
[01:03:23] probably important like these things are
[01:03:24] probably important to get but I assume
[01:03:26] you get these by just playing right
[01:03:28] Chris points automatically unlock the
[01:03:29] following Buffs applicable to all paths
[01:03:33] holy [ __ ] these Buffs are so good
[01:03:37] so I assume you want to do one and two
[01:03:39] first time off the box but I could
[01:03:40] probably do three raw because I'm a Chad
[01:03:41] true
[01:03:46] you have to do the missions
[01:03:48] oh yeah I know where the missions are
[01:03:49] surely I know where the missions are
[01:03:50] yeah I know I read that I know where the
[01:03:53] missions are yep I remember that uh-huh
[01:03:55] yes sir Yes siree I do I know exactly
[01:03:58] where missions are yep uh-huh missions
[01:04:00] are gonna be uh I got it look receive
[01:04:02] that's a mission that's a mission right
[01:04:04] uh is that a mission I don't
[01:04:07] is this a mission
[01:04:09] the missions that give you Pat
[01:04:11] path points this thing right yeah these
[01:04:15] I need 750 Cosmic fragmentations
[01:04:18] there are so many
[01:04:24] [ __ ] look at the rewards
[01:04:29] okay this is like juicy dude this is
[01:04:31] like you do this is like dude this is
[01:04:32] like creamy why did I say that
[01:04:36] holy [ __ ] end game no actually

[01:04:58] don't worry guys don't worry Okay so
[01:05:06] fully get into this I would love it I
[01:05:08] still think people would be upset though
[01:05:09] they'd be like I can't clear it so it's
[01:05:11] bad
[01:05:13] all right let's do um we have to do the
[01:05:15] remissions chat do you think I could
[01:05:17] just go into difficulty three with no
[01:05:19] [ __ ] Buffs I think I could probably
[01:05:20] do it and then in world three we do all
[01:05:22] the missions
[01:05:24] I think we could do it
[01:05:26] we'll be fine
[01:05:28] uh that hung in by bitter lunae
[01:05:31] come on play blade my blade I mean a
[01:05:33] little play Dunham
[01:05:36] he's new
[01:05:40] Ultra
[01:05:42] silver
[01:05:49] I assume in civilian Universe we
[01:05:51] probably don't need Von wack because
[01:05:52] there's a bunch of [ __ ] that gives us ER
[01:05:53] anyways
[01:05:56] um but it doesn't really matter I guess
[01:06:01] silver wolf could use her lycon though
[01:06:03] it would be better here but I want to
[01:06:05] keep this on Pila because I don't feel
[01:06:06] like yeah we'll be fine we'll be fine
[01:06:08] we'll be fine if we need to change
[01:06:10] things up we'll change things up can you
[01:06:12] play an actual team this is literally an
[01:06:13] actual team also blade is [ __ ] broken
[01:06:16] I mean and by the name is too but blade
[01:06:18] is still cracked I don't care anyone
[01:06:19] says he's actually insane you just blade
[01:06:21] brawny of the wheelchair you win
[01:06:24] Riley will be fine here
[01:06:28] um
[01:06:31] no Shield Pila
[01:06:36] we don't need it I mean blade is
[01:06:40] technically sustained if we do if we do
[01:06:42] this I don't think we die I'm not even
[01:06:44] lying
[01:06:45] we don't even need a fourth slot we
[01:06:47] don't even need a fourth slot we can put
[01:06:49] in Bible there just to look pretty
[01:06:56] oh everyone's clueless thing
[01:07:06] go ahead clueless okay fine [ __ ] you if
[01:07:10] we lose it'll be funny
[01:07:12] I don't We're not gonna lose though I've
[01:07:13] never lost in my life the rest of the
[01:07:15] audience dice will need to be
[01:07:17] rediscovered by you
[01:07:22] remember it's actually broken by the way
[01:07:24] but we're gonna do destruction
[01:07:32] there's a One-Shot mechanic okay but the
[01:07:35] boss won't be able to do it because
[01:07:36] we're gonna watch out him
[01:07:42] turns two random domains into domain
[01:07:44] Elite
[01:07:51] curio is probably stupid
[01:07:53] um it looks like there's a lot of good
[01:07:54] things you can buy with fragments oh we
[01:07:56] have the quest we have the mission of
[01:07:58] paying fragments obtain rewards we're
[01:08:01] gonna get the fragments I'll be a smart
[01:08:02] person I'll be I'll actually be a good
[01:08:04] boy to the Swarm uh overlords
[01:08:08] let's wait show your courage true
[01:08:16] repay
[01:08:18] I'm on auto battles [ __ ]
[01:08:22] try listen
[01:08:25] the times have changed
[01:08:30] the other one
[01:08:32] all good though
[01:08:39] excuse me
[01:08:43] um
[01:08:44] honestly the skillful one is actually
[01:08:46] good with blade so we can use our dad
[01:08:48] hung because like he's kind of here as a
[01:08:50] meme but if we get a skill point we can
[01:08:52] actually use him
[01:08:53] uh
[01:08:55] um
[01:08:57] probably not worth though
[01:09:00] yeah that's better
[01:09:06] why am I afraid of everything
[01:09:13] you can combine paths
[01:09:16] what am I doing uh we'll just do this
[01:09:21] no matter I don't think I need to alt
[01:09:23] here
[01:09:28] but he's not dead
[01:09:38] this this paradise savor it for me
[01:09:45] Sil could ironically be fine depending
[01:09:48] on what the boss is dude let's say we
[01:09:49] fight dude if we fight the deer with a
[01:09:52] hundred [ __ ] brother
[01:09:56] a bunch of the branches will heal up
[01:09:58] which could be good but I probably want
[01:09:59] to go aggressive so we're gonna skip it
[01:10:04] um this is good this is
[01:10:07] oh a shield oh let's take a shield
[01:10:18] I'll see you off
[01:10:21] I sent a storm
[01:10:32] shielded blade um it doesn't actually
[01:10:34] matter that much this is pretty [ __ ]
[01:10:36] cracked but crit damage is also cracked
[01:10:38] like yeah blade wants to take damage I
[01:10:40] get it but like
[01:10:42] if the boss is hard and you gonna get
[01:10:45] one shot if you don't have a shield it's
[01:10:46] fine
[01:10:47] I used to have to when I would Auto
[01:10:49] Battle weeklies if I Auto Battle
[01:10:50] weeklies without a shield I usually win
[01:10:52] but my characters are damaged I need to
[01:10:54] Auto Battle with a shield
[01:10:56] or else I don't beat the weekly boss
[01:10:58] so sometimes even if it's like not
[01:11:00] optimal it can it can like tank things
[01:11:01] for you you know true
[01:11:04] um kind of want the weakness rate
[01:11:05] efficiency but [ __ ] it I mean
[01:11:08] yeah I think yeah I think it's worth it
[01:11:17] 100 in combat all allies damage dealt
[01:11:20] increased
[01:11:23] someone doesn't believe in your luck
[01:11:25] with the dice okay fine I'll spoil it
[01:11:26] that someone is Ron May
[01:11:31] okay
[01:11:32] if you prepared a chance for you to
[01:11:33] start over
[01:11:34] read there for the fine print
[01:11:37] the [ __ ] is the fine print herder I
[01:11:39] thought you're gonna explain it to me
[01:11:42] [ __ ] it
[01:11:45] okay cool
[01:11:48] wait so when I do this wait what is the
[01:11:50] sword icon there
[01:11:52] can I click on it so I can see oh
[01:11:54] enhance
[01:11:55] oh I see
[01:11:58] wait so this thing
[01:12:04] does it it doesn't does it consumer turn
[01:12:06] let me see
[01:12:10] I kind of want to go the upwards path
[01:12:13] we'll do this no okay cool
[01:12:17] let's do this
[01:12:28] oh this is so bad with blade
[01:12:31] I mean I guess it's better than nothing
[01:12:33] and it's a destruction blessing we could
[01:12:35] also get another path resonance like
[01:12:36] remembrance is [ __ ] broken
[01:12:40] um but this blessing's not great
[01:12:45] why not reset we could reset the
[01:12:47] bustings but our destruction one's a
[01:12:48] destruction one is what I'm thinking
[01:12:55] yeah we want to get as many as we can
[01:12:56] get
[01:13:03] okay
[01:13:06] um let's go up here I do want to click
[01:13:08] on the gamer thing but I'm pretty sure
[01:13:10] this path is so [ __ ] good like this
[01:13:12] is Adventures lit and I really want to
[01:13:13] do more Adventures but I think this
[01:13:15] whole top path is like really really
[01:13:17] good top
[01:13:27] what the [ __ ] is this
[01:13:33] okay minus one [ __ ]
[01:13:35] minus one occurrence
[01:13:37] surely the next one won't be a waste
[01:13:41] it's like one domain and train it oh you
[01:13:43] use my re-roll
[01:13:46] honestly [ __ ] transaction I'm not a
[01:13:48] fight something instead
[01:13:50] no no I'm not a fight something
[01:13:53] instead of the reroll
[01:13:55] instead of the transaction I mean
[01:13:57] [ __ ] it
[01:13:59] combat is a free blessing that's not bad
[01:14:03] comment to free blessing we take that
[01:14:08] let's win
[01:14:11] uh let's see this I'm kind of losing a
[01:14:14] lot of HP on my blade though but we can
[01:14:16] just Alt
[01:14:17] undermine we have Rocher
[01:14:23] the time to change
[01:14:35] all right are we a remembrance Ronald
[01:14:39] we might be
[01:14:53] [ __ ] okay well
[01:15:00] we might go down there there
[01:15:03] we might have to do down right right up
[01:15:05] and then we skip this
[01:15:10] no it's this round never mind
[01:15:12] well wait how long does this last for is
[01:15:15] it one turn let me check might as well
[01:15:16] check
[01:15:18] is it gone let me see
[01:15:20] I might as well check it's worth
[01:15:21] checking it's worth checking
[01:15:23] so we're checking
[01:15:28] okay yeah it is gone okay
[01:15:36] run ruined it's fine we can fight these
[01:15:37] I mean at least give good blessings so
[01:15:39] I'm not as well fight them
[01:15:40] there's no real downside to doing this
[01:15:42] anyways our team's not gonna lose
[01:15:44] weight I don't know how efficient is to
[01:15:46] do it here I don't slay this fire you
[01:15:49] can like if your team's crap if you're
[01:15:50] like deck is cracked you like hunt
[01:15:51] Elites because they give like good
[01:15:52] relics I don't know if that's a thing
[01:15:54] here it looks like it might be
[01:16:00] but maybe not
[01:16:15] what is this whale team dude okay yes
[01:16:18] there's four five stars here okay but
[01:16:20] one of the two characters here is
[01:16:22] literally griefing okay pillow would be
[01:16:24] better than blade or Dan Hong ill here
[01:16:26] you pick one you don't play both
[01:16:27] together okay I'm just playing them
[01:16:29] because one they're [ __ ] and two you're
[01:16:31] like oh you can't do it
[01:16:33] ow ow nothing's major a blade knows no
[01:16:37] mercy
[01:16:38] the fight is
[01:16:41] I don't want to alt till I go on brania
[01:16:43] so we're actually knocking out here I'm
[01:16:46] gonna Brown you
[01:16:48] lend me I looked at that paradise
[01:16:54] that paradise savor it for me
[01:17:00] I'll see you off
[01:17:02] the strength
[01:17:07] somehow skill point efficient
[01:17:12] ah energy is nice not that much for
[01:17:16] bosses but I'm down probably could have
[01:17:19] reset though
[01:17:21] that is also nice might as well go to
[01:17:22] hunt busting wait what happens wait
[01:17:24] actually before I grief I run chat what
[01:17:26] happens if I have two path resonances
[01:17:27] can I use only one or both because if I
[01:17:30] can only use one I kind of grief that
[01:17:34] I will figure it out whatever we'll
[01:17:35] figure it out
[01:17:37] the combo
[01:17:40] no way
[01:17:43] it is no way
[01:17:45] show your current
[01:17:48] that's pretty cool
[01:17:54] don't get Vita vitamins for the 17
[01:17:57] months that is a lot of months if I do
[01:18:00] say so myself
[01:18:10] um this is three skill points then again
[01:18:12] I use one there then bronia can't do
[01:18:14] anything so only spend two we'll do one
[01:18:16] two
[01:18:19] I guess I could have altered but that
[01:18:21] wouldn't have really done much
[01:18:28] lend me your strength
[01:18:33] am I gonna die if I press R cause I'm
[01:18:35] gonna go low no the watch is gonna heal
[01:18:36] us
[01:18:37] should be fine
[01:18:43] wait no I don't have the R I thought I
[01:18:44] had never mind
[01:18:46] that's the only one I upgrade it
[01:18:55] he chose the wrong enemy you chose The
[01:18:58] Wrong Enemy
[01:19:04] and there's a socks what's up man
[01:19:10] I think my brownie is a tank
[01:19:19] Buffs this is these are definitely
[01:19:22] things this could be good in our team
[01:19:24] but we're gonna reset because wait no
[01:19:26] we're not no we're not no we're not
[01:19:31] we're gonna get the hunt resonance if we
[01:19:33] take this we're gonna take it
[01:19:37] this we reset
[01:19:40] I mean crit rate I guess
[01:19:45] wait I didn't get the thing why didn't I
[01:19:47] get the thing I have
[01:19:51] four I thought I would get it's fine
[01:19:55] maybe it's because I don't have the
[01:19:56] hunting unlocked yet
[01:20:00] so it lost I thought I got like the the
[01:20:03] pop-up of like the the uh Ian being like
[01:20:06] I am Ian and then you click on the horse
[01:20:08] and you get the power up read dude
[01:20:11] all good
[01:20:18] uh while batarang's warm true sting in
[01:20:23] the third plane it will be inflicted
[01:20:24] with fire weakness I don't care lighting
[01:20:26] weakness I also don't care wow that is
[01:20:29] that is pretty cool two Buffs that I do
[01:20:32] not care about
[01:20:37] Lan not Ian same thing it looks like a
[01:20:39] capital i
[01:20:43] guess I'll just watch us
[01:20:46] trick shot
[01:20:48] trick shot
[01:20:49] don't get complacent
[01:20:55] how many skill points minus three minus
[01:20:57] one then we can't brought his skill but
[01:21:00] I don't think wait action advanced
[01:21:03] yeah we're gonna triple
[01:21:10] blade knows no mercy
[01:21:15] sure a paradise savor it for me hi is
[01:21:19] this getting an impact yeah man yeah
[01:21:21] this is two
[01:21:22] this is this is the newest patch
[01:21:28] no it's stereo
[01:21:31] controlled sorry that's weird
[01:21:35] be normal man be normal dogs sorry sorry
[01:21:41] ow
[01:21:45] oh
[01:21:48] buddy hurt me
[01:21:58] fine we can we just break them
[01:22:02] actually no this is a normal
[01:22:11] this team is so scuffed
[01:22:13] [ __ ]
[01:22:15] you
[01:22:18] this strength but we knew that going
[01:22:21] into it
[01:22:33] Elation of preservation a couple of
[01:22:34] Destruction wait really where does it
[01:22:36] say that
[01:22:37] where the [ __ ] does it say that
[01:22:40] oh if you read man okay oh here you're
[01:22:42] here
[01:22:43] and platformations
[01:22:47] you will also receive three preservation
[01:22:50] and three Elation allowing for the
[01:22:52] respect wait
[01:22:55] did I get three
[01:22:57] it says you will receive three I did not
[01:23:00] receive three let me read that again
[01:23:01] upon receiving three blessings of
[01:23:03] Destruction you will also receive three
[01:23:06] blessings of preservation and three
[01:23:08] blessings of elation
[01:23:10] why does it say you will also receive I
[01:23:12] did not receive
[01:23:14] the text is wrong I see I guess it means
[01:23:16] when I also get three of either then
[01:23:18] I'll get the other thing okay it makes
[01:23:20] sense uh this is actually pretty good
[01:23:22] then I was trying to cut combo with hunt
[01:23:24] but scroll down
[01:23:27] we're in here
[01:23:31] oh this shows the combos I see
[01:23:34] I see I see I see
[01:23:37] does it still um
[01:23:41] honestly we could do preservation I
[01:23:44] thought there was a hunt combo uh full
[01:23:46] of attack regenerates energy for path
[01:23:48] resonance that's not bad
[01:23:50] we don't have that many follow-up
[01:23:51] attacks though we just have one
[01:24:03] [ __ ] I want to get this to combo but
[01:24:05] this is too good dude because if you
[01:24:06] upgrade this if you if you if you if you
[01:24:08] if you upgrade this it's cracked I can't
[01:24:11] upgrade it
[01:24:12] I'm gonna get it
[01:24:14] Fortune glue oh wait reduction ice no
[01:24:16] fortune glue no dice no glue no dice no
[01:24:18] glue glue
[01:24:21] what the [ __ ] is origin universe
[01:24:35] path challenge successful Wing flap
[01:24:50] oh we're done we're done one okay two
[01:24:55] whoa
[01:25:04] bro
[01:25:06] bro
[01:25:09] how many [ __ ] all right we're speed
[01:25:11] running this
[01:25:16] dude what okay let me download an actual
[01:25:18] fourth member to this team in case I
[01:25:20] want to Pivot and play a real team we're
[01:25:21] gonna get silver wolf and then we're
[01:25:22] also gonna get Ting you and kiss on a
[01:25:23] play uh in by better
[01:25:26] We're Not Gonna add her yet because
[01:25:28] we're still for funding but in case this
[01:25:30] you know things get a bit uh uh feisty
[01:25:33] curio
[01:25:35] I'm not very curio
[01:25:37] whoa these are you oh my God
[01:25:40] gain one to three random blessings for
[01:25:43] the current path that is sick
[01:25:45] after the start of the character's turn
[01:25:47] no wait this is sick what the [ __ ]
[01:25:51] one to three is kind of like is a pretty
[01:25:53] big margin though one is bad three is
[01:25:55] insane two is good
[01:25:58] okay if that's it I will be very angry
[01:26:07] okay yo I did surely not right surely
[01:26:12] not right surely not right
[01:26:23] we got one and it was a one star that we
[01:26:26] don't even want
[01:26:28] actually I didn't read it to be fair I
[01:26:29] forget what it does but it was a one
[01:26:31] star okay we're gonna go
[01:26:35] chat okay so blade destruction wants
[01:26:38] probably Elites for more destruction
[01:26:40] blessings
[01:26:42] Dan hung in Bible lunae is a basic
[01:26:44] attacker so he probably wants sworn
[01:26:46] unless swarm is bad I don't actually
[01:26:47] know how swarm Works yet uh what the
[01:26:49] [ __ ] are these electoral question marks
[01:26:52] a current swarm
[01:26:56] oh manka w
[01:27:00] ow storm is just cracked okay I see
[01:27:03] oh there's also this oh yeah I feel like
[01:27:07] I read that and then I forgot about it
[01:27:09] true w
[01:27:10] ow okay so Elites are definitely very
[01:27:11] good
[01:27:13] but apparently swarm is cracked too
[01:27:15] there's an elite up there so if we go
[01:27:16] top we get one Elite and then like two
[01:27:18] Swan things
[01:27:20] I also want to see what this does so we
[01:27:21] might go like top top and then do these
[01:27:23] three into an elite if we go at the
[01:27:25] bottom yeah countdown's [ __ ] awesome
[01:27:27] it's fine we would have only got two
[01:27:28] Elites
[01:27:29] maybe three for really cringe with it
[01:27:31] but let's just do two
[01:27:40] I think we do this into this into this
[01:27:42] into this into this into this into this
[01:27:45] into this
[01:27:47] yeah the countdown's gonna [ __ ] us but
[01:27:49] like what can we we literally can't do
[01:27:50] anything about it we literally can't do
[01:27:52] anything about it there's no way for us
[01:27:53] to [ __ ] skip through it
[01:27:58] whatever
[01:28:07] dude the countdown doesn't scare me I
[01:28:09] can count myself
[01:28:11] true
[01:28:16] What's So Scary About Counting don't get
[01:28:19] complacent
[01:28:21] I sent a storm
[01:28:30] oh [ __ ] I could altered again
[01:28:39] [ __ ] I don't have enough skill points
[01:28:42] fine
[01:28:59] rip my HP
[01:29:02] never mind he's dead
[01:29:06] okay uh preservation
[01:29:09] is good for the combo blessing but I
[01:29:11] don't know if I want to waste a five
[01:29:12] star uh an elite golden blessing on it
[01:29:22] but we do get a pretty big Shield [ __ ]
[01:29:24] it [ __ ] it
[01:29:39] nice
[01:29:49] so if swarm is bad we could change it
[01:29:51] but I think storm is good from what I
[01:29:53] can tell so
[01:29:55] we could make some random [ __ ] of combat
[01:29:57] to me I don't even think I mean we could
[01:29:58] just make money I don't even think I
[01:29:59] want to do a combat I think I want to do
[01:30:00] this this this this and that occurrence
[01:30:03] so let's give it up
[01:30:07] reward is reward good I think reward is
[01:30:09] good right truly
[01:30:11] foreign
[01:30:18] oh my God we got the morning cave
[01:30:22] what is morning cave
[01:30:24] oh my God
[01:30:30] wait these are so good uh
[01:30:33] it has two random three stars is uh
[01:30:36] pretty cracked
[01:30:42] this is also pretty [ __ ] cracked
[01:30:44] though
[01:30:46] [ __ ] it
[01:30:47] nice that's what I wanted that's all
[01:31:06] all right swarm time
[01:31:09] the expansion of the Swarm is causing
[01:31:10] extreme tension across the cosmos
[01:31:13] Cosmic divide Astra valorant badge
[01:31:19] what the [ __ ] is [ __ ] you bug
[01:31:22] uh uh should I use the technique point
[01:31:24] no
[01:31:28] but he's always mode it looks really fun
[01:31:29] but we just started it so we're at the
[01:31:30] early difficulties so we'll see when it
[01:31:32] gets harder also you just reminded me I
[01:31:34] need to
[01:31:35] log into the engine to refresh my risk I
[01:31:38] didn't say that
[01:31:43] can I play a turn or is it just their
[01:31:45] turn all the time that's all good I'm
[01:31:46] just checking like I just wanted to know
[01:31:47] like it's no big deal but it's coming
[01:31:53] oh I probably should have cleansed my
[01:31:55] [ __ ] Ally I'm stupid whatever I
[01:31:58] wasn't really paying attention it
[01:32:00] doesn't matter it's just random mobs
[01:32:01] though yeah that's fine
[01:32:05] surely it's fine right surely they get
[01:32:08] [ __ ] plans at some point
[01:32:24] thank you
[01:32:28] awake cleansing dragons Target
[01:32:33] I don't know
[01:32:34] there's always a weakness okay we do
[01:32:38] this
[01:32:40] [Music]
[01:32:44] and we did this and I think I want to
[01:32:46] alt before they hit me a million times
[01:32:47] because we can kill that guy although
[01:32:49] weakness break might already kill him so
[01:32:50] I'm kind of just griefed with that play
[01:32:52] yeah whatever
[01:33:00] mind it was smart
[01:33:08] okay cool we're gonna sound good Paul
[01:33:10] strap
[01:33:11] pause champ
[01:33:13] uh this is really good
[01:33:17] after character uses their skill and if
[01:33:19] the skill did not unleash an attack all
[01:33:22] allies damage dealt
[01:33:23] if a character uses their skill and if
[01:33:25] the skill did not unleash an attack
[01:33:28] all allies damage dealt with 20 for one
[01:33:30] turn there's gonna be stacked with three
[01:33:32] times
[01:33:33] oh
[01:33:36] if the team has zero skill points or an
[01:33:38] alley is a business attack you get two
[01:33:39] okay my team is so [ __ ] dog [ __ ]
[01:33:41] skill points but this looks pretty
[01:33:44] cracked so does this actually no this is
[01:33:48] insane what the [ __ ]
[01:33:52] and blade that probably works with blade
[01:33:55] skill right because blade skill just
[01:33:56] enhances
[01:33:59] holy [ __ ]
[01:34:03] poggers man that is so pog
[01:34:06] all right cool
[01:34:14] stand
[01:34:17] wait what is this
[01:34:19] [ __ ] I wanted to do this I wanted to see
[01:34:22] what the question mark was but this has
[01:34:23] the Trotter man
[01:34:24] no but it's a waste it's a waste it's
[01:34:26] literally minus one because if I do that
[01:34:27] then I don't progress forward no no [ __ ]
[01:34:29] the Trotter [ __ ] you Trotter stupid ass
[01:34:31] Trotter I don't like the countdown go up
[01:34:37] okay what is in a current swarm let's
[01:34:39] see uh that's the first time we do this
[01:34:42] I do not like the looks or the sounds of
[01:34:45] this one
[01:34:57] the Swarms alertness will be greatly
[01:35:01] increased

[01:58:52] [ __ ] I kind of want to use them by
[01:58:53] better now
[01:58:57] oh soos blade
[01:59:07] Adventure Time
[01:59:11] adventure oh I should have revived my
[01:59:13] [ __ ] dude for this because this
[01:59:14] technique is so good
[01:59:38] we could download yukong
[01:59:40] or Kafka Kafka is actually a good idea
[01:59:45] oh yeah Cafe's a good idea we could use
[01:59:47] her technique in the middle stay in the
[01:59:49] middle that requires a bit more thinking
[01:59:51] but
[01:59:59] wait that's not a castle
[02:00:06] [Laughter]
[02:00:31] how many did I get I guess if the count
[02:00:33] 21 I don't have it 21. can you do yeah
[02:00:37] that Hung Yellow is so much better dude
[02:00:39] you missed one it doesn't matter we
[02:00:40] didn't get 30. it's fine we got two
[02:00:42] Chargers
[02:00:44] I should revived him dude I should have
[02:00:46] known to revive him all good this is
[02:00:49] pretty nice this one is
[02:00:55] I don't know if I want to lose more HP
[02:00:57] but that damage is
[02:01:00] I don't want to lose more HP though
[02:01:07] however we are playing blade yeah
[02:01:12] this entire mode is yeah it's literally
[02:01:14] a [ __ ] imbiverter ad actually
[02:01:25] okay well I'm not entering combat
[02:01:29] wait wait
[02:01:34] dude
[02:01:35] five percent more damage right and four
[02:01:37] percent damage received I can TR I can
[02:01:39] give the boss that if I go here surely
[02:01:42] surely surely surely that's worth the
[02:01:45] trade-off of whatever blessing I'm gonna
[02:01:47] get here surely
[02:01:55] okay I'm not gonna do it I'm afraid
[02:02:01] yeah we Loki got [ __ ] by the deer
[02:02:03] earlier I don't risk it I mean we got
[02:02:06] hacked okay wait before I break these
[02:02:09] um
[02:02:10] am I playing and buy better because I
[02:02:12] could revive him and he is pretty broken
[02:02:14] but I kind of want to play blade because
[02:02:16] he's hot
[02:02:30] why not play both we probably don't have
[02:02:32] enough skill points to play both
[02:02:35] I mean we do have a lot of skill point
[02:02:37] blessings we might it's just not gonna
[02:02:39] be ideal
[02:02:43] and vibrator isn't hot okay yes he is I
[02:02:45] mean they're both hot dude
[02:02:55] you can always alt f4
[02:02:58] um
[02:02:59] so uh guys you should download Hawkeye
[02:03:01] style rail this stream uh at least the
[02:03:04] Swarm gameplay is a a hashtag ad so you
[02:03:08] know Paul I mean I was gonna stream it
[02:03:09] anyways but it is so I'm not going to be
[02:03:12] uh uh alt f4ing or having my game
[02:03:14] mysteriously crash as that would not be
[02:03:16] the best look
[02:03:18] so we're gonna win and we're not gonna
[02:03:20] lose true
[02:03:25] now he plays Beth on whether you win or
[02:03:27] lose shut the [ __ ] up I'm not gonna lose

[02:03:51] download MC actually it doesn't matter I
[02:03:52] have Max technique points I mean I'm not
[02:03:54] gonna be Max technique with you so
[02:03:55] that's not it okay
[02:03:57] uh
[02:03:58] uh [ __ ]
[02:04:06] dude there's so many options to enhance
[02:04:08] I don't even want to read all of them
[02:04:35] you can download oh I forgot you can
[02:04:37] upgrade these [ __ ] I didn't read them
[02:04:39] [ __ ] these are probably broken
[02:04:43] uh yeah that is [ __ ] insane oh my God
[02:04:46] I mean that's fine
[02:04:54] yeah I mean I do want to upgrade this
[02:04:55] one anyway so it's fine and then we just
[02:04:57] level another one costing a hundred
[02:05:02] no
[02:05:05] that's actually not oh once per battle
[02:05:07] ew
[02:05:08] that's not bad for blade that's whatever
[02:05:11] that could be fine that's fine
[02:05:18] no it's only ten percent I got like this
[02:05:20] for blade
[02:05:22] it's probably not the best one though
[02:05:34] yeah we could go effector as I'm not
[02:05:36] against it but
[02:05:41] this is also it's only five percent crit
[02:05:43] rate
[02:05:44] yeah yeah I'm not a personal factorized
[02:05:47] sure
[02:05:48] okay chat you can gamble your points

[02:10:14] also
[02:10:18] we shouldn't have two DPS this year but
[02:10:19] I really don't care so
[02:10:22] um
[02:10:30] should probably make my brownie the tank
[02:10:31] here I mean I'm kind of griefing my
[02:10:33] bronya I don't really care about her but
[02:10:40] we'll be fine
[02:10:46] yeah we're fine
[02:10:54] all right Evo's nothing
[02:10:58] that is really good thank you launcher
[02:10:59] you are broken
[02:11:02] it's fine
[02:11:04] that's fine
[02:11:05] surely we can press R without
[02:11:07] immediately dying
[02:11:26] what is it we're waiting okay we win
[02:11:29] this
[02:11:34] fine we have a pretty big shields
[02:11:39] good start it is we have a [ __ ]
[02:11:41] massive Shield there's literally nothing
[02:11:42] that could damage us watch and then
[02:11:44] we're gonna all once brawny above us
[02:11:50] oh that gives me energy [ __ ] Charlton
[02:11:53] whatever
[02:11:54] your strength
[02:11:59] of the storm to guard and defense crush
[02:12:01] them
[02:12:03] the paradise savor it for me
[02:12:13] perfect wait blade give us a skill point
[02:12:16] that's not what I wanted
[02:12:19] all good
[02:12:26] strength
[02:12:30] because weak to imaginary it's actually
[02:12:32] made from vibrator dude they literally
[02:12:33] tailored this [ __ ] swarm Brown
[02:12:37] that's fine I'm about to put on a
[02:12:39] one-time speed though because I might
[02:12:40] have to react all to some things but I
[02:12:42] think I'll be fine I don't need to
[02:12:43] Altier
[02:12:44] we can just chill
[02:12:55] waiting drains one's bigger yeah
[02:13:12] yeah
[02:13:18] four winch here on brania it's
[02:13:21] unfortunate
[02:13:22] I don't mean to that
[02:13:37] okay
[02:13:44] we're chilling
[02:13:53] okay phase two
[02:13:56] I'm afraid I don't know if he's gonna
[02:13:58] hit me I'm like just like chilling I
[02:13:59] feel like he's gonna summon things so I
[02:14:00] don't think I should alt well wait it's
[02:14:03] probably about to summon things
[02:14:04] okay now we'll alt
[02:14:06] uh let's hit the main one though I'm
[02:14:09] gonna press R but I'm gonna wait
[02:14:12] it's fine
[02:14:14] it's mine that's fine I sent a storm
[02:14:25] but then brania goes next
[02:14:30] [ __ ] is this why is it exploding
[02:14:49] wait my next action's advanced
[02:14:59] okay uh is my next action still advanced
[02:15:02] yet is
[02:15:04] so we might as well just shoot
[02:15:08] I guess I could have double buffed if
[02:15:10] that works but it's fine
[02:15:13] first whatever doesn't matter
[02:15:25] I guess they could kill us the odds
[02:15:27] first
[02:15:29] probably be easier that way yeah I'll be
[02:15:32] easier that way
[02:15:36] [ __ ] I didn't get my Buffs
[02:15:47] there's something more is that it
[02:15:50] that's fine
[02:15:52] oh can't even break my shield oh real
[02:15:56] tough real talk
[02:16:02] okay nothing
[02:16:05] nothing oh it sounds more
[02:16:09] okay sorry uh we have enough skill
[02:16:11] points launch after cool we're gonna hit
[02:16:14] I kind of want to hit an ad again but
[02:16:17] wait are they all considered summoned do
[02:16:18] they all disappear when I
[02:16:21] okay it should disappear when I go to
[02:16:23] the next phase right
[02:16:24] maybe that's a clueless moment but I
[02:16:26] think that's true
[02:16:35] they don't
[02:16:40] Eternal sleep is not the thing
[02:16:57] received Divinity
[02:16:59] repay you chose The Wrong Enemy
[02:17:10] lending your strength
[02:17:19] I mean I guess that's not a bad Hill
[02:17:23] could focus this I want to be safe as
[02:17:25] [ __ ]
[02:17:26] oh my God
[02:17:29] [Music]
[02:17:36] waited to get Buffs before halting but
[02:17:38] I'm afraid as [ __ ] so I'm gonna alt this
[02:17:40] guy so kills in prison might kill him I
[02:17:42] don't really want to risk it I could go
[02:17:43] here because that also hits him I think
[02:17:45] that's smarter
[02:17:51] I will dispatch you
[02:17:57] nice oh my God I love you blade I love
[02:18:00] you so much your AOE is so good your AOE
[02:18:02] is so good that hung in by better lunae
[02:18:04] he only hits three dudes blade he can
[02:18:06] take them all he can handle every guy on
[02:18:09] screen
[02:18:17] okay so far so good so far so good
[02:18:21] our Shields haven't even been broken so
[02:18:23] like as long you know surely world five
[02:18:25] when we get to difficulty five we still
[02:18:27] our Shield won't be broken what is this
[02:18:29] thing doing what just happened
[02:18:32] well this is the boss we should probably
[02:18:33] focus it
[02:18:38] I can alt now because I'll get a stack
[02:18:40] for my passive Turtles
[02:18:42] repeat through things as soon as
[02:18:46] which one is the it's all true thing
[02:18:48] they all say true thing which one is the
[02:18:50] [ __ ] truest thing that has to defeat
[02:18:51] this thing is this thing that's a
[02:18:52] lesser's thing is this thing interesting
[02:18:55] it doesn't even have a name yes it is
[02:18:57] wait
[02:18:58] yes it is okay uh I should stun this
[02:19:01] right
[02:19:03] or should I focus the main
[02:19:04] I could stun this one
[02:19:07] wait but then this action goes later if
[02:19:09] I
[02:19:10] oh no it's because I'm breaking I could
[02:19:12] break both I could literally break if I
[02:19:13] hit here
[02:19:15] and then I go again yep I can break both
[02:19:16] I can bring about GGI win
[02:19:22] wait I don't have that many skill points
[02:19:24] I actually have none but bronya oh my
[02:19:26] God I love Rania oh my God brania oh my

[02:19:42] it if I kill an enemy because of ejecto
[02:19:44] wait when is eject abortion gonna
[02:19:46] process in every six turns
[02:19:48] how many [ __ ] turns
[02:20:03] wait okay there's definitely a right
[02:20:04] play here I wanna attack this although
[02:20:06] which I can break it okay yeah yeah this
[02:20:07] is definitely replay I'm gonna spam four

[02:21:56] designed with these blessings in mind to
[02:21:59] make it way easier dude look at how much
[02:22:01] more stats you get from all of these I
[02:22:04] don't have any so when we get to four

[02:30:16] actually do anything what if I permaban
[02:30:20] oh it sounds working
[02:30:23] oh yeah I could also just unmod it wait
[02:30:25] what if I just unmod it is this still a
[02:30:27] mod wait
[02:30:29] oh yeah it's just not modern anymore
[02:30:30] okay that's fine
[02:30:34] okay I'll remod it later
[02:30:40] okay
[02:30:46] what is the trial dhil do more damage
[02:30:48] than yours no the [ __ ] it doesn't
[02:30:52] no it doesn't
[02:30:54] dude also there is no I literally
[02:30:56] disabled that if it didn't work so I had
[02:30:57] no other choice all good okay uh inviter
[02:31:01] bronia okay Chad do I have to be cringe
[02:31:04] and run like an actual fourth character

[02:31:10] do I have to be cringe I don't want to
[02:31:12] be cringe
[02:31:13] you guys said I have to be friends for
[02:31:14] World difficulty three and I worked fine
[02:31:35] we'll just download silver wolf and we
[02:31:37] might play it before the boss I guess
[02:31:38] whatever
[02:31:40] uh
[02:31:41] uh okay is abundance and Hunt actually
[02:31:44] that good let's see what it does let's
[02:31:45] see what upon it says
[02:31:48] so immediately apply Mercy from
[02:31:51] OverWatch okay wait wait so
[02:31:53] oh these are dice effects okay never
[02:31:56] mind uh
[02:31:58] every remaining point in the countdown
[02:32:00] increases the outgoing healing
[02:32:05] the Imagine effect when the first or
[02:32:06] second plane begins applies Mercy to two
[02:32:08] random domains continuous effect
[02:32:10] countdown is reduced by tax return extra
[02:32:12] counts
[02:32:14] while entering a domain with the mercy
[02:32:15] effect countdown will increase ins oh
[02:32:18] will increase that's really good
[02:32:21] every kind of Point increases let's open
[02:32:24] healing
[02:32:25] path resonance
[02:32:30] wait three propagation the [ __ ] this
[02:32:33] three propagation do after characters
[02:32:35] are HP restored
[02:32:37] recover one skill point this effect can
[02:32:39] only trigger once per residence use
[02:32:41] after triggering this effect all damaged
[02:32:42] out by allies is produced by 30 for two
[02:32:45] turns stacks of attention times
[02:32:49] that's pretty good that is pretty
[02:32:52] [ __ ] good
[02:32:53] okay
[02:32:56] subduing Elvis
[02:33:08] okay we could do abundance we can't we
[02:33:11] also yoink a button oh we don't have
[02:33:12] this unlocked
[02:33:17] oh remembrance
[02:33:25] wow the speed gets decreased what
[02:33:39] uh Ramirez is pretty broken in like the
[02:33:41] regular simulator I don't know this one
[02:33:42] I think we just I'm not at a sand
[02:33:44] abundance we could do hunt first too we
[02:33:47] could do a hunt into abundance
[02:33:52] wait there's literally a Trotter thing
[02:33:53] these are just generate [ __ ] Trotters
[02:33:55] that's kind of cracked
[02:34:04] okay we might have to abundance for
[02:34:06] world five for four we might just
[02:34:08] [ __ ] uh hunt or destruction
[02:34:11] that looks fun though
[02:34:24] hunt Elation is good wait what does that
[02:34:26] do
[02:34:33] yeah I kind of like the healing though I
[02:34:35] can't lie
[02:34:42] okay [ __ ] it we'll do hunt abundance
[02:34:43] Hunt is more fun I bet it's probably
[02:34:45] better but whatever
[02:34:50] Duke engine dailies and resin while you
[02:34:52] do abundance gameplay dude dude dude
[02:34:55] dude chill
[02:35:01] s down with the propagation oh I guess
[02:35:04] we could do propagation
[02:35:06] or whatever it doesn't matter okay let's
[02:35:08] go
[02:35:09] going on blessings right no we don't
[02:35:11] curio
[02:35:12] whoa typical genius Society gossip
[02:35:16] what the [ __ ]
[02:35:19] I don't know this curio is obtained will
[02:35:21] increase 100 but blessings will no
[02:35:23] longer be
[02:35:25] what the [ __ ]
[02:35:34] blessings will no longer be obtained
[02:35:37] after combat
[02:35:40] what is the point of this
[02:35:42] this is for [ __ ] this for the robe
[02:35:44] the [ __ ] robe if you have it
[02:35:47] all right well shattered starbate I
[02:35:48] guess
[02:35:49] take it and restart the Run
[02:35:54] dragons
[02:36:05] 30 Jades yeah but we'll get it later
[02:36:07] whenever a run is doomed we'll take it
[02:36:09] or like later in the Run
[02:36:13] oh my God they're not dead oh they'd be
[02:36:15] dead
[02:36:26] you chose the wrong well Behavior dude
[02:36:29] it's not like I'm saying I don't want
[02:36:30] the James it's I'm saying I'm gonna get
[02:36:32] them but I'll get them tomorrow it's
[02:36:34] like would you rather have one cookie
[02:36:36] today or two cookies tomorrow a hundred
[02:36:39] cookies in a week I would choose the
[02:36:42] hundred cookies
[02:36:43] I don't know about you but I would
[02:36:46] choose on your cookies
[02:36:51] I will dispatch
[02:36:56] dispatch
[02:37:09] I kind of don't like this but whatever
[02:37:21] that's actually pretty cracked of Lucha
[02:37:22] uh the first one we got was this
[02:37:27] you can take that good Diamond District
[02:37:28] damage both are probably fine
[02:37:36] dice allies can move to any domain in
[02:37:40] the next three columns during the
[02:37:42] movement phase of this round
[02:37:50] voice I could go all the way here but
[02:37:51] then I skip a Trotter I don't really
[02:37:53] want to skip a Trotter do I
[02:37:55] so what is the point of skipping I don't
[02:37:57] want to skip
[02:37:59] let's go here
[02:38:09] for one's countdown yes but also
[02:38:11] prevents a Trotter wait that thing turn
[02:38:13] into a question
[02:38:16] Why did the
[02:38:20] why did that turn into a question mark
[02:38:22] there's a [ __ ] Trotter there
[02:38:26] dude what is this Trotter doing bro
[02:38:30] why is it raining indoors
[02:38:38] what is dude I am so confused
[02:38:41] can I get this without triggering the
[02:38:42] Trotter
[02:38:48] he's crying
[02:38:50] [Music]
[02:38:52] zaj
[02:38:54] doches
[02:39:09] man [ __ ] this Trotter healing everyone
[02:39:14] Frick this Trotter dude
[02:39:18] yeah I said it I said frick
[02:39:21] and I don't regret it
[02:39:24] and I'm not sorry about it
[02:39:36] the paradise must savor it for me
[02:39:44] go got the Trotter
[02:39:48] what's up Ray uh
[02:39:51] [Music]
[02:39:59] uh it feels bad passing up on this I
[02:40:01] mean I guess Elation does synergize with
[02:40:04] a hunt
[02:40:07] we don't really have full effects though
[02:40:09] because I'm probably gonna bench blade
[02:40:10] before the boss so
[02:40:20] you know
[02:40:23] I don't mind if I do okay we'll take
[02:40:26] that we'll take that we'll take that
[02:40:27] we'll take that
[02:40:28] huh
[02:40:33] can we move the domain in the closest
[02:40:34] column that contains either a button
[02:40:36] Charter or a cure Charter rewards gained
[02:40:37] are double
[02:40:39] oh my God
[02:40:41] oh my God oh my God oh my God
[02:40:45] doubled
[02:40:48] caution does not mean cowardice
[02:40:51] let's wait let's see
[02:40:57] I am pogging right now
[02:41:01] okay
[02:41:02] Trotter what are you gonna do
[02:41:08] um
[02:41:10] it's bizarre
[02:41:14] okay
[02:41:24] I probably should have saved the skill
[02:41:26] point but whatever
[02:41:29] that paradise may be unreachable savor
[02:41:31] it for me
[02:41:40] nice dude [ __ ] jumps
[02:41:44] difficult is this we just got to four so
[02:41:46] we're doing four now
[02:41:48] we will clear it with no problems not
[02:41:50] copium by the way wait is the charter
[02:41:52] about to leave no I don't know he still
[02:41:54] has weaknesses so not yet
[02:41:56] okay oh he's dead
[02:42:08] okay this is fine a blade does in fact
[02:42:13] know no mercy
[02:42:30] what's up
[02:42:33] do not fret repay
[02:42:39] contact guys I'm just doing something
[02:42:41] really fast
[02:42:43] okay we should be good for the rest of
[02:42:44] the fight uh okay we'll attack here
[02:42:47] and then we get cleanse blade but no
[02:42:50] it's fine
[02:42:51] and then all this
[02:42:58] thank you
[02:43:03] let's settle this
[02:43:07] receive Divinity
[02:43:09] Paradise savor it for me
[02:43:14] [ __ ] are you doing I'm just trying to
[02:43:16] hold man
[02:43:23] oh Chargers do drop when a character's
[02:43:26] HP is restored do I get dewdrop in the
[02:43:29] if I'm doing a hunt and abundance Duo
[02:43:39] yep
[02:43:44] yep all right let's do it
[02:43:47] this could be fine you know healing we
[02:43:49] dig it I mean whatever it's a hot thing
[02:43:51] you gotta hunt thing boom yes sir yes
[02:43:52] sir yes sir I do want to do
[02:43:55] do one but for early God like this
[02:43:57] what's this
[02:44:04] boom roll the dice
[02:44:06] quelled Fury oh there's a speed okay
[02:44:08] whatever I mean
[02:44:10] uh uh I do want to do the gaming
[02:44:15] Adventure one
[02:44:17] but the Swarm one is tempting as well uh
[02:44:19] if we do Adventure we can go to Trotter
[02:44:20] next but then that wastes the turn
[02:44:24] whereas swarm is pretty [ __ ] cracked
[02:44:26] so I am indecisive I think I will do
[02:44:37] I actually don't know I think they're
[02:44:39] both good I think if I don't care about
[02:44:40] the countdown going down getting these
[02:44:42] two in is better than these two but
[02:44:45] swarm itself is pretty good but getting
[02:44:46] the charter gives me 30 crit damage
[02:44:51] yeah I'm good
[02:44:55] get the propagation blessing
[02:44:57] yeah but there's no combo with hunt
[02:44:58] right
[02:45:00] where's hunt
[02:45:03] how the [ __ ] do I see it from here
[02:45:13] yeah there's none
[02:45:23] oh yeah the Trotter can move actually
[02:45:26] that is true [ __ ]
[02:45:31] I'm down are you actually convinced I'm
[02:45:32] not gonna do swarm yeah that's true
[02:45:34] Trotter does move
[02:45:37] oh but it just went
[02:45:49] yeah I should have known
[02:45:54] you are really smart [ __ ] you I mean
[02:45:57] okay to be fair this is probably better
[02:45:58] anyways like not even coping this is
[02:46:00] just probably better okay [ __ ] you it's
[02:46:02] actually probably better anyways I just
[02:46:04] kind of wanted to get the Trotter
[02:46:27] my end approaches me my head
[02:46:36] I don't have any thoughts small
[02:46:41] okay cool battle over
[02:46:43] it's joover uh this is nice because it's
[02:46:47] an unlock if not we do this one
[02:46:55] I mean that's basically 48 crit value
[02:46:58] what is my crit rate though 76 78 that
[02:47:01] we have way too much [ __ ] crit rate
[02:47:03] hunt also gives you a lot of crit rate
[02:47:04] that is kind of useless here
[02:47:07] it's like 24 criterate is [ __ ] insane
[02:47:10] but it's like we have so much dude
[02:47:15] hunt converts it oh I
[02:47:18] don't we need a blessing for that though
[02:47:19] we need a blessing
[02:47:28] at the unlock
[02:47:40] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:47:42] I'm sorry dude
[02:47:44] 100 cookies tomorrow
[02:47:48] allies can move to any domain in the
[02:47:50] next three column is the oh that's good
[02:47:52] for the Trotter yes sir Trotter get the
[02:47:55] [ __ ] back here brother boom plus one
[02:47:57] Trotter
[02:47:58] plus one Trotter and I played that
[02:48:01] optimally because I knew that was gonna
[02:48:02] happen I wasted a [ __ ] technique
[02:48:04] Point against a random ass mob I'm a
[02:48:06] dumbass true LOL w
[02:48:09] ow what's up Trotter
[02:48:15] the time to change
[02:48:35] savor it for me okay
[02:48:38] all right cool so we're so good
[02:48:48] cheer G
[02:48:50] oh I mean I don't I don't know if I'm
[02:48:53] gonna need I mean cleanse is a cleanse
[02:48:54] right we have the ultra and brownie we
[02:48:55] literally have two cleanses but cleanse
[02:48:57] the Clans and it's energized with hunt
[02:48:59] and it's an unlocked so I value that I
[02:49:01] guess
[02:49:03] after enemy Target defeated
[02:49:07] restores all allies HP to 50 other
[02:49:10] respective is not going to be
[02:49:13] hey
[02:49:23] intra-terrestrial big Lotto after
[02:49:26] destroying destructible objects there's
[02:49:28] these small transfers to me one random
[02:49:30] blessing
[02:49:31] that's all that's all I have to say I
[02:49:32] don't even need to read the rest I don't
[02:49:33] even care about the [ __ ] fine print
[02:49:35] give me the [ __ ] ticket
[02:49:42] there is no space between a and combat
[02:49:44] by the way however if you guys want to
[02:49:46] change that no big deal it's not a big
[02:49:47] deal don't worry still love you guys
[02:49:48] just saying you could put a space there
[02:49:49] anyways um uh uh this is useless so what
[02:49:55] does quick roll do
[02:49:56] I don't want to know
[02:49:59] this is like good like usually this is
[02:50:01] really good but we're at the boss right
[02:50:02] now so I don't think I wanna not do the
[02:50:04] boss
[02:50:06] good reroll but I don't think I care
[02:50:08] about yeah we'll just go it's fine
[02:50:22] skips the animation oh
[02:50:26] when rattling it will be inflicted by
[02:50:27] physical weakness fire dude why does it
[02:50:30] never give a weakness of a character in
[02:50:32] my party why does it never match the
[02:50:35] types at least silver wolf time for a
[02:50:37] bug at least at least she only has like
[02:50:40] uh maybe 50 chance to plant her dog
[02:50:42] should Quantum that you don't want or
[02:50:43] whatever else is in your team but but
[02:50:45] why is there a zero
[02:50:47] okay it's fine we'll just fight the
[02:50:49] [ __ ] horse I guess I mean yeah we'll
[02:50:51] fight the horse
[02:51:01] return
[02:51:17] search
[02:51:23] all right there should be a [ __ ] ton of
[02:51:25] damage yup

[02:52:28] anymore it's literally not even like a
[02:52:30] comic a comic book you can't even I have
[02:52:33] no skill points it's not even like it's
[02:52:35] not even a yoke at this point

[02:52:40] Royale King
[02:52:46] thank you
[02:52:52] Fool's mask all blessings and possession
[02:52:55] are swapped okay dude you gotta be
[02:52:58] kidding our swap to random blessings
[02:53:01] with their enhancement levels retained
[02:53:03] retained with a chance of being replaced
[02:53:05] by
[02:53:08] this is so bad
[02:53:14] yo we are not clicking that I do not
[02:53:18] care we are listen we can take that when
[02:53:20] a run is doomed we can just go for
[02:53:22] unlocks I like having that as a
[02:53:24] possibility but there is no way we take
[02:53:27] this over [ __ ] Doctor's robe
[02:53:29] it's good
[02:53:31] okay
[02:53:33] it could be okay

[02:53:41] gonna move on
[02:53:43] I'm gonna doctor's robe and I'm gonna
[02:53:45] move on you will become a musical note
[02:53:51] what
[02:53:55] foreign
[02:53:59] oh who would
[02:54:01] replacing all of your [ __ ] blessings
[02:54:03] would ruin your run
[02:54:08] why is the Trotter in Narnia dude it's
[02:54:10] fine
[02:54:12] um
[02:54:15] someone might as well let's get uh thank
[02:54:18] you or no silver
[02:54:25] hello there urda give me a curio
[02:54:27] actually do I want something for the
[02:54:29] something

[02:54:34] wait can I not see the fire
[02:54:38] whatever I just want to see that enough
[02:54:39] last things don't have a thing where I
[02:54:41] need to enhance blessings
[02:54:44] I really want to take the curio but I'm
[02:54:46] pretty sure one of my missions is
[02:54:47] enhance a bunch of blessings so I
[02:54:48] probably should do that
[02:54:53] I can't check it from here why can't I
[02:54:55] check it
[02:55:06] back out but I can go back when I leave
[02:55:09] right surely surely right I don't trust
[02:55:11] it I actually don't know okay I wanna
[02:55:14] just enhance I actually feel like I
[02:55:16] can't
[02:55:16] uh yeah I feel like her just dips
[02:55:21] yeah we might as well level our thing I
[02:55:23] think it's worth that is a death when
[02:55:27] any Ally uses the ultimate attack oh
[02:55:30] yeah so it goes from oh yeah you can
[02:55:32] inherit it now right that's the thing
[02:55:33] yeah
[02:55:36] oh that is good cool
[02:55:45] sure I guess another
[02:55:47] uh we can go to the middle because then
[02:55:49] that leaves us more possibilities true
[02:55:50] stay in the middle like you a little I
[02:55:52] play the fiddle but combat is good for
[02:55:54] our Quest and our Quest is like oh we
[02:55:56] need to combat and then
[02:56:00] can I say it in this menu yes again so
[02:56:03] see we need to enhance but we also need
[02:56:04] to do six combat buzzings
[02:56:06] swarms are considered combat right
[02:56:08] combat swarms so we could just do this
[02:56:10] next we can do this into that
[02:56:14] yeah [ __ ] it
[02:56:17] where did the charter go
[02:56:20] oh Trotters
[02:56:22] wait does that count towards the hunting
[02:56:23] fog
[02:56:26] I heck and love Trotters
[02:56:28] I actually dude okay and ironically I
[02:56:31] think the hunt thing in this mode is so
[02:56:33] fun the fact that there's Trotter is
[02:56:34] everywhere I like it
[02:56:35] you guys think I could kill the middle
[02:56:37] one shortly right Eternal our team's AOE
[02:56:39] so I don't see why we wouldn't be able
[02:56:40] to
[02:56:53] we've entered the storm
[02:57:09] okay mathing time let's say I do two
[02:57:12] skill points
[02:57:13] then brawny uses one conflict requires
[02:57:17] undivided then Don Heng uses one that's
[02:57:19] four and then Blake can't do anything
[02:57:20] but if I do uh okay I could do a level
[02:57:22] zero on here
[02:57:24] then I do this
[02:57:28] did I do three and then I alter I'm
[02:57:31] still boxed
[02:57:33] cleansing track and then blade
[02:57:43] too much AOE
[02:57:45] Divinity three Trotters Two Carries one
[02:57:50] Nick that's me
[02:57:53] the paradise may be unreach savor it for
[02:57:56] me
[02:58:05] that was [ __ ] insane okay really good
[02:58:09] ah this is fine
[02:58:13] that's fine oh
[02:58:15] that's good we have so much good rate
[02:58:18] nice okay that's the conversion
[02:58:26] sure
[02:58:30] nice that was really good
[02:58:32] just in the nick of time haha ad zionics
[02:58:35] Ma's been that guy thank you thank you
[02:58:37] thank you thank you thank you guys thank
[02:58:38] you thank you all right let's go to
[02:58:40] swarm
[02:58:45] but this is like uh like one two
[02:58:49] three four five six whereas this is one
[02:58:51] two three four five so I could save time
[02:58:54] if I go middle but I kind of want to do
[02:58:55] swarm
[02:58:56] is it worth it probably not am I gonna
[02:58:58] do it anyways you [ __ ] betra
[02:59:02] foreign
[02:59:17] I just didn't notice the icon or
[02:59:19] recognize it
[02:59:23] I'm gonna die should I have healed I
[02:59:25] should have [ __ ] healed I should have
[02:59:27] what the [ __ ] that's fine Lewis is
[02:59:29] broken it turns how much damage do they
[02:59:31] do on turn one bro
[02:59:34] how much damage did you turn one
[02:59:37] the times are changed
[02:59:50] okay
[02:59:52] okay
[02:59:54] I don't this is probably bait but I feel
[02:59:57] like I want to read this anyways just
[03:00:00] because
[03:00:02] bro they are ruining the game just like
[03:00:05] gentian bullet sponges that nuke whales
[03:00:07] are barely beating this [ __ ] first of
[03:00:09] all
[03:00:12] a lot of the whales that are okay not
[03:00:14] every whale is good at the game you can
[03:00:16] wail and still be dog [ __ ] that's number
[03:00:17] one number two
[03:00:18] this is permanent content it's not an
[03:00:20] event okay so in an ideal world you're
[03:00:23] not beating this day one and you unlock
[03:00:25] all the progression mechanics to build
[03:00:27] get Buffs get Buffs kind of like a
[03:00:28] roguelike right if you played any
[03:00:30] roguelike you probably haven't because
[03:00:31] got your games but you know slay the
[03:00:32] Spire Hades [ __ ] whatever you're like
[03:00:35] leveling you're like building your
[03:00:36] [ __ ] Arsenal and then you go back in
[03:00:38] stronger bigger faster harder
[03:00:41] the song I was yeah that's number one
[03:00:45] number two what invention at all
[03:00:47] anything what maybe one piece of content
[03:00:50] and get you outside of maybe the abyss
[03:00:52] in 3.8 with the [ __ ] constipated
[03:00:54] beasts that has ever remotely looked
[03:00:57] like this
[03:01:00] okay back to play uh
[03:01:09] it's also not um it's also optional by
[03:01:12] the way so it's not just it's permanent
[03:01:14] and it's optional and it gets easier the
[03:01:17] more you play it
[03:01:18] if you want like you don't have to make
[03:01:20] it easier but you get a bunch of unlocks
[03:01:22] that buff you and make it more like like
[03:01:24] okay I would argue this might be a bad
[03:01:26] take but I would argue that if you could
[03:01:28] beat this instantly oh this looks insane
[03:01:30] by the way if you could beat this
[03:01:31] instantly right now
[03:01:33] that it'll be way too [ __ ] easy it
[03:01:35] wouldn't be like oh it's it's balanced
[03:01:36] because I can do it it's like no you're
[03:01:39] supposed to keep doing it and then make
[03:01:41] yourself better and then you can do it
[03:01:44] for HD motor covered apply one Spore
[03:01:46] what the [ __ ] is Spore this is so much
[03:01:48] text
[03:01:50] [Music]
[03:01:53] I'm sorry when this workout is equal or
[03:01:56] greater than three it will burst
[03:01:58] wind damage
[03:02:00] uh I just cannot spread it's like Bloom
[03:02:03] right it's like Bloom getting this is
[03:02:06] dendro for each skill point recovered
[03:02:07] wait from what just when I gain a skill
[03:02:09] point so there's damage when I gain a
[03:02:11] skill point
[03:02:12] okay
[03:02:15] this gives me HP this is good for Dad
[03:02:17] hung
[03:02:22] it's just damage yeah boy yeah let's
[03:02:25] just take this I want to see it anyways
[03:02:27] what it does but it looks good so
[03:02:33] oh jss we change okay we changed the
[03:02:35] meme gention command to like get into an
[03:02:38] impact 2 or something that's like a meme
[03:02:39] command for it but actually we're
[03:02:41] getting back is the link to download the
[03:02:42] game because we did a stream and I
[03:02:43] didn't want it to be like I don't want
[03:02:44] okay I didn't want there to be like a
[03:02:46] corpus stream where like we're like
[03:02:47] watching something and then it's like
[03:02:48] it's some type and then it's like oh is
[03:02:51] that a gentian reference
[03:02:53] all right let's do the combat with the
[03:02:54] blessing Trotter
[03:03:12] okay what the [ __ ] is
[03:03:20] the time
[03:03:34] that paradise May savor it for me dude
[03:03:38] okay like the Easter all right play what
[03:03:39] you like but the thing that [ __ ] with
[03:03:41] me because it's because like I know
[03:03:43] that's why we're not getting end game
[03:03:45] because I know that even if it's purely
[03:03:47] optimal uh sorry not optimal if it's
[03:03:49] purely optional people will still be
[03:03:51] like I felt forced to do it and now I
[03:03:53] hate this game it's like no stop you
[03:03:56] don't dude stop it if you're just a
[03:03:59] story gamer that's perfectly fine play
[03:04:01] your story that's cool we love it but
[03:04:04] why would you be mad at the optional
[03:04:06] content
[03:04:08] all good these kind of I mean we could
[03:04:10] do Elation for the duo blessing thing
[03:04:13] with hunt
[03:04:16] yeah I mean we could this isn't really
[03:04:17] good but
[03:04:20] wow four percent
[03:04:23] wow I can't wait for four percent more
[03:04:27] damage
[03:04:29] sheesh
[03:04:31] uh this is so bad wait what even is the
[03:04:35] Dual blessing I have to read it I have
[03:04:36] to make sure it's actually good because
[03:04:38] if not I'm like throwing
[03:04:40] uh speed okay yeah speed is nice it's a
[03:04:42] validator donated one dollar the dollar
[03:04:45] on a side note what's your favorite
[03:04:46] Rogue like Mr socks mine is ISA I do
[03:04:49] like mining or Isaac I I played like I'm
[03:04:52] not that good I play like 60 hours and I
[03:04:53] still feel like complete dog [ __ ] in
[03:04:55] that game darkest dungeon I the first
[03:04:57] game I fully beat and like a hundred and
[03:04:59] hundred hours I [ __ ] love darkest
[03:05:01] dungeon
[03:05:03] um but the Jazz favorite is Hades so
[03:05:05] I've been playing I played that with him
[03:05:06] for a while I like Hades too so this
[03:05:09] part is good too barisca Raines also
[03:05:11] good but I suck at that one too
[03:05:14] honestly every roguelike I've tried I've
[03:05:17] enjoyed
[03:05:23] this is good especially if you upgrade
[03:05:26] it
[03:05:26] 'll try darker dungeon too not yet it's
[03:05:28] out right I haven't tried it yet
[03:05:34] but I fully beat the the first one it
[03:05:37] was very fun
[03:05:44] I really want to go up here here there's
[03:05:46] a nice Trotter but he moves to adjacent
[03:05:48] tiles but I could chase him down be like
[03:05:49] come here short and I could get him
[03:05:52] um but I mean this also gives me the
[03:05:54] gamer bat chest I'm not gonna go down oh
[03:05:57] maybe I should have went there to cover
[03:05:58] more ground and then I could
[03:06:06] I knew it in my mind I was like oh my
[03:06:10] [ __ ] okay well
[03:06:13] lesson learned I guess
[03:06:15] lesson learned
[03:06:17] lesson learned
[03:06:28] [ __ ] dude how do I do that man how did I
[03:06:32] do that to myself
[03:06:34] why did I do that
[03:06:37] there was no reason there was literally
[03:06:39] no benefit at all to go down instead of
[03:06:42] middle because if I'm in the middle I
[03:06:43] can still go there but instead I locked
[03:06:45] myself out because I'm [ __ ] stupid
[03:06:46] now I'm gonna go here watch it's gonna
[03:06:47] [ __ ] go up and then and then GG
[03:06:50] go up I dare you okay that's fine that's
[03:06:52] fine
[03:06:55] true I should have stayed in the middle
[03:06:56] like you a little
[03:06:59] oh I mean we don't really need this but
[03:07:01] we'll take it
[03:07:05] don't you [ __ ] dare don't you [ __ ]
[03:07:14] wait it's about to summon more why did I
[03:07:16] press R now

[03:07:32] attacked with any of our characters it
[03:07:34] was just our path thing

[03:17:02] next time they consume skill points
[03:17:03] it'll be considered as one additional
[03:17:06] skill point consumed okay I mean that's
[03:17:08] bad but oh no is that like good is that
[03:17:11] like
[03:17:11] I use one accounts as two that could be
[03:17:13] good for each scope I consumed the
[03:17:15] characters crit damage is increased by
[03:17:17] four
[03:17:18] stack up to two times
[03:17:23] oh it's like I used one but it counts as
[03:17:25] two like it's considered two for this so
[03:17:27] if I use three okay I see I see how this
[03:17:30] works this is really good but let's do
[03:17:32] brief description okay it's the longest
[03:17:34] [ __ ]
[03:17:38] this is really good too though but it's
[03:17:40] obviously not as good as this yeah
[03:17:48] wait it's already 4 40 AM holy [ __ ]
[03:17:52] all good
[03:17:53] wait Chad do I need to do my attention
[03:17:54] dailies do I get any reputation for
[03:17:57] doing the Fontana ones it doesn't all
[03:17:58] matter I would focus on [ __ ] dailies
[03:18:00] in so long
[03:18:07] no okay it's fine if I miss them then
[03:18:12] oh could I have moved directly to the
[03:18:14] boss why did I do this am I gonna lose
[03:18:16] again I still won't have technique
[03:18:17] points am I stupid
[03:18:21] I was autopiloting because I was talking
[03:18:22] about
[03:18:25] bro if I lose again
[03:18:44] can I break their Shields if I downhung
[03:18:46] off right now
[03:18:51] Awakening scales oh my God I'm a [ __ ]
[03:18:54] genius okay
[03:18:57] uh we'll hit the Trotter too oh but he's
[03:19:00] about to dig right so it doesn't matter
[03:19:01] because he's about to like
[03:19:03] right I think so so I think we do this
[03:19:07] yeah
[03:19:08] well I can't speed it up
[03:19:15] not yet oh he's just scared okay we
[03:19:18] probably should have done but all good
[03:19:21] for nowadays
[03:19:25] foreign
[03:19:36] yeah we could have prevented that all
[03:19:38] good
[03:19:41] that is oh my God that was beautiful
[03:19:45] amazing Ultra beautiful
[03:19:48] Eternal sleeping
[03:19:57] we're low on skill points to go and buy
[03:19:59] bitter I could go blade they're pretty
[03:20:02] low HP blade might be able to hit them I
[03:20:03] also want to hit the Trotter if I hit
[03:20:04] here it hits him and the Trotter
[03:20:15] crush them
[03:20:19] okay that was fine
[03:20:21] that was good
[03:20:22] that's good
[03:20:24] that's good the paradise may be
[03:20:26] unreached savor it for me
[03:20:29] so good
[03:20:30] I got blade stats now I can't press C
[03:20:32] right here oh I can't
[03:20:37] for each skill point a character
[03:20:38] consumes all enemies will gain one sport
[03:20:42] this is really good but sure
[03:20:48] free blessing recess that's good cause
[03:20:50] of fragments that's good at the start of
[03:20:51] a character's turn there's our HP equal
[03:20:53] to 20 other Max HP is this every single
[03:20:55] turn every character's turn that's
[03:20:57] pretty good I mean it's free HP with
[03:20:58] abundance that could be good and it's an
[03:21:00] unlock
[03:21:02] every turn sheesh
[03:21:04] all right I'll try it out
[03:21:06] easy unlock
[03:21:10] let me do the boss
[03:21:14] while battling the Swarm trusting in the
[03:21:16] third plane enemy's action will be
[03:21:18] delayed by another 50 percent
[03:21:20] when they become weakness broken
[03:21:22] Japan
[03:21:24] allies recover one skill point every
[03:21:26] time an enemy receives a killing blow
[03:21:31] um we are going to be killing a lot of
[03:21:33] enemies
[03:21:34] I don't think the delay matter okay
[03:21:36] delayed is a big deal but
[03:21:40] also Japan is less annoying than kokolia
[03:21:42] and I do like the skill points we're
[03:21:44] gaining
[03:21:46] hmm
[03:21:48] look at this
[03:21:51] trouble ahead I still have no technique
[03:21:53] I'm with you
[03:22:05] I probably should have waited for him to
[03:22:07] Shield before using my R because it
[03:22:08] doesn't actually do much here but
[03:22:09] whatever
[03:22:15] bro is this guy who's gonna do [ __ ]
[03:22:18] 18 actions before I get to play the game
[03:22:19] or no like be honest with me is that
[03:22:21] what do you plan on doing
[03:22:25] The Wrong Enemy because that's kind of
[03:22:27] [ __ ] weird if you ask me
[03:22:50] oh I just did this good one for blade
[03:22:55] I got saved I got saved
[03:23:03] I have
[03:23:06] 589 crit damage shot and a 124 crit rate
[03:23:10] [Laughter]
[03:23:15] I have 5800
[03:23:19] I'm gonna screenshot this I could
[03:23:21] probably get more
[03:23:22] I might have done my turn
[03:23:24] I don't even know if Ryan is almost
[03:23:26] acted I didn't probably but
[03:23:37] this is such a waste to do two here
[03:23:39] I want to do it though
[03:23:44] oh no wait it's free it's literally free
[03:23:45] oh but I don't get a skill point for
[03:23:46] blade blade needs a [ __ ] skill point
[03:23:48] man
[03:23:52] no I can't just not use my blade dude I
[03:23:54] can't just not use Blade no I can't as
[03:23:57] much as I wanted to
[03:24:08] that paradise May savor it for me
[03:24:13] that's why I should get E2
[03:24:15] [ __ ] you I mean true E2 is broken but
[03:24:17] I'm not and I have to say
[03:24:20] whoa whoa whoa
[03:24:29] I should have waited I should have
[03:24:30] waited before procking [ __ ] face too
[03:24:32] dude
[03:24:38] why like why is it so punishing it just
[03:24:42] it just it's just it's just
[03:24:46] like if my game is seriously crashes I'm
[03:24:50] pretty sure I can beat this but I don't
[03:24:53] know if I want to do that
[03:24:58] because this run is good
[03:25:02] but I will dispatch you
[03:25:05] in the name
[03:25:07] we can take one more hit than we all the
[03:25:09] mind we heal I should assaulted
[03:25:17] the paradise
[03:25:22] time to finish this maybe you should
[03:25:25] have just done to call you bro
[03:25:28] huh failed
[03:25:33] in the name
[03:25:37] all right I'm not gonna I'm just gonna
[03:25:40] let it die I think this run could win by
[03:25:42] the way for the record I think this run
[03:25:44] could win
[03:25:45] we just didn't have a technique going in
[03:25:47] and then I proced okay that's not even
[03:25:48] the problem I should have proged phase
[03:25:50] two
[03:25:52] before I was ready I just I just kind of
[03:25:55] went in without like yeah I think we
[03:25:57] should just let this go through I pretty
[03:25:59] sure this run is winnable
[03:26:05] but
[03:26:11] we could hey the game could mysteriously
[03:26:14] crash
[03:26:18] I just don't know if I want to do that
[03:26:28] that's all good happens to the best of
[03:26:31] us trust me I would know but it's good
[03:26:33] because we get unlocks now now we get
[03:26:35] unlocks wow pog
[03:26:41] wait where am I unlocks
[03:26:46] uh that's not what I meant by unlocks
[03:26:51] commuting trial
[03:26:55] they're not even done
[03:27:07] this is a tragedy
[03:27:20] oh we're still on this [ __ ] light
[03:27:22] cone
[03:27:24] do this man not build your part um do
[03:27:26] you think I have
[03:27:28] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[03:27:30] let me build my drip hard let me build
[03:27:32] my drip hard I'm sorry I'm sorry let me
[03:27:34] let me build my depart I'm sorry
[03:27:37] oh yeah what the [ __ ] did I do to my
[03:27:39] Louisa
[03:27:43] okay this is plus six and I don't have
[03:27:45] attack or and okay I mean
[03:27:49] yeah we don't talk about it I could also
[03:27:51] just put it on HP because imaginary
[03:27:53] doesn't really do anything it's not like
[03:27:54] we're dealing damage I just don't have
[03:27:55] an attack one I literally don't have an
[03:27:57] attack ball like it's not like I don't
[03:27:58] want to use one I just don't have one
[03:28:07] okay fine I think we clear with this
[03:28:20] picked Yan Chang okay but I don't regret
[03:28:22] that the engine's the [ __ ] goat don't
[03:28:24] you disrespect dancing like that dude
[03:28:26] yanjing is a Chad I love yanjing
[03:28:39] use him then what do you mean dude he's
[03:28:42] actually a chad
[03:28:43] he's good in remembrance runs I just
[03:28:46] I've moved on I've just moved on
[03:28:53] oh we got more paths
[03:28:57] wait what is this this looks funny
[03:29:00] entering any domain will grant happiness
[03:29:02] with an unknown effect okay I mean
[03:29:10] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:29:13] this what the [ __ ] is happiness
[03:29:33] Chad should I have one [ __ ]
[03:29:34] preservation dude
[03:29:40] man I kind of want to do hunt again but
[03:29:43] you can like Loki get one-shotted
[03:30:06] I mean we could just do a hunt again and
[03:30:08] combine it with a bun it's like I think
[03:30:09] our run was good
[03:30:12] we just died but I don't really think
[03:30:13] that was like a run issue it was more of
[03:30:15] a skill issue
[03:30:19] abundance with two healers I mean
[03:30:23] that's so boring dude
[03:30:27] oh I didn't immediately put me in
[03:30:29] whatever
[03:30:30] I mean I guess that's what we're doing
[03:30:47] item prices and transaction domains
[03:30:52] okay I'm
[03:31:01] dude what is this
[03:31:06] I mean I guess it's
[03:31:14] it's an unlock
[03:31:16] it's an unlock
[03:31:18] I didn't get to put a second healer in
[03:31:19] but I surely won't need it right
[03:31:31] yeah maybe curio start wasn't the play
[03:31:36] this is
[03:31:46] you need like six healers LOL w
[03:31:51] the LOL w
[03:32:04] ow oh that was reminding me I should
[03:32:05] probably [ __ ] upload the second
[03:32:06] Channel video this [ __ ] has been
[03:32:07] unlisted for so long
[03:32:09] all good oh I kind of want to eject the
[03:32:10] boards in we can combo with hunt right
[03:32:13] I'm an eject the borison lover
[03:32:17] abundance can a combo with nihility
[03:32:23] and is that it
[03:32:25] wait uh isn't I mean oh this thing yeah
[03:32:27] the [ __ ] swarm
[03:32:32] oh it doesn't really do I didn't
[03:32:33] actually read it
[03:32:40] we can just break break effect oh we can
[03:32:43] just break efficiencies actually pretty
[03:32:44] good
[03:32:47] okay we'll do this for now though I mean
[03:32:49] defense yeah it might help us not die
[03:32:58] is this the Subway Surfer run if we add
[03:33:01] a second healer it is for now it's fine
[03:33:04] wow we're chilling we're still we're
[03:33:06] still engaged and entertained
[03:33:28] it was rig efficiency how fast you can
[03:33:29] break the shields
[03:33:32] not the same as break effect
[03:33:37] oh that's [ __ ] sick
[03:33:41] where's the mercy oh those are all Mercy
[03:33:43] okay we should go up uh I could do
[03:33:45] combat because I need that for a thing a
[03:33:48] Ley line a buff a blessing and unlock
[03:33:50] that's what's called an unlock so we're

[03:34:52] know you that much
[03:35:03] yep this one's always good uh this is I
[03:35:07] mean I mean this could be good it could
[03:35:09] prevent us from getting [ __ ]
[03:35:10] one-shotted uh the hot ones don't combo
[03:35:12] with us I'm also down to re-roll but

[03:35:15] money so we're gonna click this next one

[03:35:18] thought those two
[03:35:27] this is useless but we're not gonna
[03:35:28] reroll

[03:36:16] before the [ __ ] Trotter dude
[03:36:20] I should have I guess altered or
[03:36:22] something no speed actually no speed
[03:36:24] though at least it's double speed thanks
[03:36:26] I don't even know if I can kill this
[03:36:28] thing in time
[03:36:31] I don't even think I have damage dude
[03:36:33] okay
[03:36:34] ah [ __ ] I'm gonna do this because I
[03:36:37] don't trust myself

[03:36:47] any mathematic should want to tell me if
[03:36:48] the alt's gonna kill him dude why does
[03:36:50] my brownie move slower than a [ __ ]
[03:36:51] Trotter should I get my brother
[03:36:54] my brother is be tuned for my blade not
[03:36:57] this team okay so she should have more
[03:36:58] speed in this team

[03:37:06] okay I okay
[03:37:10] I don't wanna

[03:37:40] there's literally no way I'm resetting
[03:37:41] out Trotters there's no way right
[03:37:43] there's actually no way I reset the
[03:37:46] Trotters right there's no [ __ ] way
[03:37:47] I'm about to do this right
[03:37:51] okay dude I hey dude okay no shame in
[03:37:55] this but one more try dude dude dude how
[03:37:58] do I lose the Trotters okay in my
[03:38:01] defense and I know my defense might seem
[03:38:03] Bleak okay but my bronya had like no
[03:38:07] speed okay my bronio was slower than a
[03:38:09] Trotter how does that even happen how
[03:38:12] can a bronya be slower than a pig
[03:38:14] [Music]
[03:38:16] a piggy was faster than my bronya
[03:38:24] sorry our game Crash that's my fault
[03:38:25] it's on my end
[03:38:28] I don't know what happened I'm sorry
[03:38:29] guys
[03:38:44] it's okay
[03:38:48] 129 I mean it's fine should be enough
[03:38:51] for this we could go more but
[03:39:00] I don't even have one of these [ __ ]
[03:39:02] leveled
[03:39:09] hmm that could help
[03:39:12] she's better than IL yeah
[03:39:16] it's a new day
[03:39:19] okay we're not gonna lose this time
[03:39:22] no trolling like action no trolling
[03:39:27] timely this combat needs optimizing
[03:39:39] let's settle this
[03:39:43] okay we're not losing this one
[03:39:46] Eternal sleep
[03:39:50] I don't actually know when the [ __ ] to
[03:39:51] use my R in this team or like just in it
[03:39:53] with abundance in general but a nice
[03:39:55] heel eventually it'll cleanse too
[03:40:18] crush them
[03:40:22] cleansing dragon
[03:40:32] all right we got it can I have fun this
[03:40:36] time
[03:40:42] strength
[03:40:46] bronia is next though
[03:40:53] oh that's a lot of diving
[03:40:56] might as well Trotter no we get all
[03:40:58] three here
[03:41:00] enemy
[03:41:08] I mean we don't even need these Brown
[03:41:09] I'm gonna be cocky about it
[03:41:11] but we don't need brania
[03:41:14] we just went here
[03:41:17] [ __ ] three Trotters okay uh first try by
[03:41:20] the way first try uh obviously for this
[03:41:23] is no this is fine I guess whatever sure
[03:41:26] I might as well take the bus thing
[03:41:30] um we want to combo it with swarm I
[03:41:32] guess so the rest don't really matter
[03:41:34] this is sure
[03:41:41] foreign
[03:41:47] do this
[03:41:53] okay so this one
[03:41:59] is good for cleansing do we need cleanse
[03:42:02] against the final boss I think so so we
[03:42:04] want to get it what are the other ones
[03:42:05] lethal damage
[03:42:07] okay feathers and soon the battle for
[03:42:10] the use of the path resonance the path
[03:42:12] res
[03:42:17] used
[03:42:22] oh wait this looks good
[03:42:25] this is good that is really good yeah
[03:42:27] but it does look good one also I will do
[03:42:29] three first I agree
[03:42:31] you need a second I'm not gonna die
[03:42:34] don't worry
[03:42:36] you taste so good yeah this is just a so
[03:42:38] this playlist is a playlist of all our
[03:42:39] playlists in one playlist so it could
[03:42:41] each song could differ from difference
[03:42:44] to difference okay
[03:42:46] if I go right right let's I go right can
[03:42:49] I go down after and then down and then
[03:42:50] there or is it gonna force me to go to
[03:42:51] the boss
[03:42:54] no okay so I have to choose
[03:42:58] I want to go middle I think because also
[03:43:00] we have the thing that makes transaction
[03:43:02] Cost Less
[03:43:11] oh the transaction is this now I forgot
[03:43:13] that was transaction okay that's
[03:43:14] actually better than I thought
[03:43:22] I like that
[03:43:25] I like this let me look at Herta though

[03:47:03] that it literally has its own turn
[03:47:05] that's so sick

[03:47:13] this [ __ ] lightning lieutenant
[03:47:22] okay no more Auto bottle
[03:47:29] you off
[03:47:43] this combat needs Optimum this is double
[03:47:46] speed I went oh zox is live and was
[03:47:50] about to click then my sister went no
[03:47:52] please don't click
[03:47:55] that didn't happen that did not happen
[03:47:57] that does not happen
[03:48:01] I went to Starbucks and I they asked for
[03:48:05] my name and I said bailu and they were
[03:48:07] like oh my God from a Hawkeye star Rail
[03:48:09] and then everyone clapped
[03:48:14] blood Clan
[03:48:23] that happened by the way real
[03:48:33] this is so [ __ ] good
[03:48:38] I only got two and they're normal ones
[03:48:39] but all good
[03:48:43] whoa origin universe
[03:48:56] oh okay yeah it applies now cool
[03:48:59] okay cool when you finish the first
[03:49:01] plane or whatever plane you're on they
[03:49:03] apply that's really cool so it didn't
[03:49:04] snapshot at the start it's knob shots at
[03:49:07] the end of each plane true
[03:49:09] true I'm a plane
[03:49:20] um I could start on the transaction
[03:49:22] because then I'm guaranteed a green
[03:49:24] thing after if I start here there's a
[03:49:26] chance that goes green they could do
[03:49:27] boom boom
[03:49:32] oh you're forced to start there wait why
[03:49:34] did I think I could choose my
[03:49:44] wait why did I do Natasha over Balu
[03:49:54] forgot we don't need a cleanse
[03:50:05] nice uh yeah I mean I want to go there
[03:50:08] anyways cool plus one to the countdown
[03:50:14] there's our song uh this is Thanks for
[03:50:16] the Memories
[03:50:23] okay that did nothing I forgot
[03:50:27] um let's go here we don't have money
[03:50:41] pause trap
[03:50:43] no Trotters
[03:50:46] what the [ __ ] is this have I done this
[03:50:48] before what
[03:50:50] the [ __ ] is this
[03:50:52] fight the curse of captivity
[03:51:02] oh
[03:51:08] don't get complacent
[03:51:11] no I did that
[03:51:13] time for a bug
[03:51:26] I was gonna say does anyone know why I'm
[03:51:28] running broad answer to you in here but
[03:51:30] then I remember that if I run to you and
[03:51:31] she's gonna get [ __ ] Omega aggro
[03:51:33] priority and then just die and then I'm
[03:51:35] gonna lose her instantly turn one
[03:51:36] against the Swarm
[03:51:38] so maybe that's why
[03:51:46] I have no skill points I mean I guess
[03:51:48] Brown is an accident doesn't matter
[03:51:54] never mind we still have no skill points
[03:51:56] [Music]
[03:52:04] there's a lot of [ __ ] death
[03:52:07] actually no it wasn't it looked like
[03:52:09] more than it actually was
[03:52:21] crush them
[03:52:23] I could use my skill on silver wolf
[03:52:26] there this combat needs Optimus
[03:52:32] if I just thought about all this I feel
[03:52:33] like there's no way to [ __ ] up here
[03:52:36] I want to make my Dew Drop damage than
[03:52:37] dude why isn't it damaging them I want a
[03:52:40] heal and do damage
[03:52:51] I'll see you all
[03:52:58] foreign
[03:53:12] I'm sorry I'm sorry to break it to you
[03:53:17] it's like one in fifty thousand
[03:53:20] good luck though you got this I believe
[03:53:22] in you
[03:53:24] uh I'm honestly down in front of these
[03:53:26] so damage is so low it's probably not
[03:53:28] the right take though
[03:53:30] yeah that's not the right take
[03:53:34] wow more healing woo I love abundant
[03:53:39] wow more healing I love about
[03:53:45] all right
[03:53:47] oh I can choose one well I think at this
[03:53:50] point it doesn't really matter but
[03:53:52] I think we do double swarm agree or
[03:53:54] agree do you agree or do you agree
[03:53:56] wait can I give it to the boss
[03:53:59] oh cool
[03:54:03] all right that might have been a waste
[03:54:04] but I don't know I could
[03:54:12] go
[03:54:19] jaggle there's only five months of prime
[03:54:21] gaming I appreciate it
[03:54:25] wait someone was about to get one shot
[03:54:29] nevermind
[03:54:36] oh my God
[03:54:38] [Music]
[03:54:46] I should say the skill point there I
[03:54:47] wasn't really thinking but it's fine
[03:54:57] nothing major
[03:55:04] we've entered the storm you never think
[03:55:07] I can't dude yes I do I'm sorry there
[03:55:10] are millions of decisions to micromanage
[03:55:12] on top of a twitch chat distracting my
[03:55:15] every thought
[03:55:21] I sent a storm
[03:55:31] uh we're gonna do it here
[03:55:33] adults
[03:55:35] yeah
[03:55:42] okay I guess you don't need salt
[03:55:45] look at those enemies then you swarm
[03:55:53] dude we have no damage we need sports
[03:55:55] for more damage I want the [ __ ] Jades
[03:55:57] but we literally need damage or this
[03:55:59] Run's gonna be like Joe Verso yeah I
[03:56:02] have to
[03:56:05] oh I can apply more Mercy
[03:56:07] Parkers
[03:56:11] so another swarm
[03:56:13] the more the merrier the more the
[03:56:16] merrier and we can do console
[03:56:27] let's win I'll save my technique points
[03:56:30] actually just these two
[03:56:44] okay that's fine
[03:56:50] Eternal sleep is
[03:56:53] can we even lose I feel like we can't
[03:56:59] search
[03:57:03] scales
[03:57:14] lend me your strength
[03:57:22] and it begins
[03:57:25] [ __ ]
[03:57:34] dude I want to take the No No I can't I
[03:57:37] can't stay strong soldiers I can't if I
[03:57:39] take any unlocks that give me more
[03:57:41] [ __ ] HP or defense this run will
[03:57:43] literally last until the middle of it's
[03:57:45] already tomorrow dude it's already 5 a.m
[03:57:47] it's already tomorrow I'm sorry
[03:58:03] okay let's just go
[03:58:14] way too dank
[03:58:21] [ __ ]
[03:58:30] wait where
[03:58:33] wait where the [ __ ] are four

[03:58:44] cracked okay how did I miss them
[03:58:46] what the [ __ ]
[03:58:49] how did I I don't know but I was like
[03:58:51] okay
[03:58:53] um
[03:58:55] that's good
[03:59:00] what the [ __ ] is tough tuzzled
[03:59:03] black hole trap you will obtain 10
[03:59:05] Cosmic practice reach Ally who's hp's at
[03:59:07] maximum winning a battle I mean that's
[03:59:08] good with ours I guess what okay
[03:59:16] wait that's good I mean it's only eight
[03:59:18] percent but that's good
[03:59:20] wait but does this count for the last
[03:59:22] boss
[03:59:24] it's only a
[03:59:26] oh this is also money
[03:59:29] uh I actually don't I feel like all of
[03:59:31] these are fine this is a lot of money
[03:59:32] this is a lot of money this is a bit of
[03:59:34] damage if you missed his socks we also
[03:59:37] want to do a lot of swarm occurrences
[03:59:38] but I don't think that eight percent is
[03:59:40] like that big of a deal because it's not
[03:59:42] like it's stacking it's just eight
[03:59:55] fine
[03:59:59] thank you
[04:00:01] also an unlock Troop

[04:03:18] can
[04:03:27] World fours again
[04:03:31] low chance to leave safely low chance to

[04:08:02] single instance of damage okay
[04:08:07] sure why is she even at the team at this
[04:08:10] point

[04:08:24] search
[04:08:28] I should probably hit brania but we'll
[04:08:29] hit brawny with the second hit after we
[04:08:31] go with our brania
[04:08:43] dude if we implanted Quantum okay if we
[04:08:46] implanted imaginary we literally
[04:08:50] l-i-c-h-t-r-i-i-l-l-i win the game we
[04:08:52] literally just win if we implanted
[04:08:54] imaginary but it might still be winnable
[04:09:02] that is not very fog
[04:09:07] watch watch bad money she's about to hit
[04:09:10] myself off again
[04:09:12] oh memorize this attack guess who's
[04:09:14] gonna get a Target oh oh okay nevermind
[04:09:16] nevermind I stagger
[04:09:19] you're [ __ ] me right you're [ __ ]
[04:09:21] with me right there's a joke it's a
[04:09:22] prank smiling on camera
[04:09:32] can't even move because she's [ __ ]
[04:09:35] I can't even use my bronya to make my
[04:09:37] Lucha go and heal because my brownie is
[04:09:40] literally like
[04:09:43] I actually don't need silver wolf here
[04:09:45] though I think it's fine
[04:09:49] we need to have a skill point for The
[04:09:51] Witcher though I'm assuming Brian is
[04:09:53] gonna Auto attack
[04:09:55] scales
[04:10:02] this thing's attacking next you think my
[04:10:04] ALT can kill it I could alt it
[04:10:12] I don't think it can
[04:10:14] [Music]
[04:10:18] um
[04:10:24] fine I'll see you off
[04:10:28] received Divinity do not threat repay
[04:10:33] I should not have done that
[04:10:38] Okay I lied about it being fine
[04:10:40] I said it's fine what I meant to say was
[04:10:43] oh oh my God
[04:10:45] he cocked my abundance okay I mean
[04:10:49] well
[04:10:54] okay on ironically like okay no memes at
[04:10:57] all silver wolf not implantic imaginary
[04:11:00] just killed us like there's literally
[04:11:01] nothing we could have done we could have
[04:11:02] okay we could have swapped brania
[04:11:05] with Ting Yoon which would have been
[04:11:08] better
[04:11:09] but it's the world not implantic
[04:11:11] imaginary just literally griefed us
[04:11:15] all good
[04:11:18] yeah cocolio is not
[04:11:20] uh very fun for this team
[04:11:33] was this useless you get one shot at one
[04:11:35] turn yeah but I think it was still
[04:11:37] winnable like we had we had damage we
[04:11:40] just needed to break the weakness but we
[04:11:43] couldn't break the weakness
[04:11:45] because
[04:11:47] um
[04:11:51] I was gonna say because we didn't
[04:11:52] implant imaginary we could have just
[04:11:53] used Ting Yoon though I guess thinking
[04:11:55] probably would have died but
[04:12:14] I'm probably a bus
[04:12:20] that was fun though
[04:12:31] yeah swapping to literally anything
[04:12:34] other than silver wolf or just getting
[04:12:35] lucky I mean granted we were on her
[04:12:37] wrong like cone this could have helped
[04:12:44] but that could have made it a lot easier
[04:12:47] homage
[04:12:51] could also use
[04:12:53] blade but she's also not weak to win so
[04:12:56] I blade would have beat the deer we
[04:12:58] definitely we beat the deer before I
[04:13:00] don't think
[04:13:04] now to face your party yeah
[04:13:14] so anyways give you so much that I can
[04:13:15] run err for real yeah it's actually not
[04:13:17] a bad idea also
[04:13:18] I think you know to guarantee the
[04:13:20] implant I just didn't have her
[04:13:21] downloaded I couldn't even but I or like
[04:13:24] bailu if we want no damage and then just
[04:13:26] like no but we got a one shot it that's
[04:13:28] a bad take we could have we got a thing
[04:13:29] you end
[04:13:30] but like to you definitely would have
[04:13:32] died
[04:13:33] because she had the same HP as a silver
[04:13:34] wolf and a silver wolf died but
[04:13:38] that was revive that is true
[04:13:52] that is true I need to unlock this eight
[04:13:54] percent HP that is quite a lot of HP
[04:13:57] when your HP total is 7452.
[04:14:21] fire MCE unironically probably
[04:14:24] firefce unironically could have helped
[04:14:28] but then our damage would have been so
[04:14:30] bad dude
[04:14:34] I think your blade carries a destruction
[04:14:35] I think destruction with Don Hong or
[04:14:37] blade I think the structure is pretty
[04:14:38] cracked we could try it
[04:14:42] I do want to go for longer but I
[04:14:44] probably shouldn't because it's 6 a.m 5
[04:14:46] 30.
[04:14:50] Lucha and fire empty carry me yeah I do
[04:14:53] think we could clear this for sure I
[04:14:55] might do a bit more off stream and then
[04:14:57] I'll stream some more later
[04:14:59] uh but for now I should probably call it
[04:15:02] I do like the sword mode I think it's
[04:15:03] [ __ ] fun
[04:15:04] it's actually pretty hard too which is
[04:15:06] good and it gets easier the more you
[04:15:07] like not easier but like you unlock a
[04:15:08] [ __ ] on a Buffs so I definitely have
[04:15:10] to play it more which I will I'll
[04:15:12] probably play this off stream and I'll
[04:15:13] try to stream it at some point
[04:15:16] um like this week maybe
[04:15:17] we'll see
[04:15:19] um
[04:15:20] I do really like it though it was very
[04:15:21] fun
[04:15:45] we also got unlucky with uh I think
[04:15:47] cocolia deer is like probably
[04:15:50] the most annoying bosses because like
[04:15:52] even like sparog or Japan or like the
[04:15:55] [ __ ] any of the others they don't
[04:15:57] really want shot you as much like most
[04:16:00] of them you could heal in between
[04:16:04] like swarov's bad but abundance can just
[04:16:06] like like you can just heal the hit it's
[04:16:08] not gonna install one shot you
[04:16:15] and your part you could Perma Shield
[04:16:16] break
[04:16:19] the hands yeah but they still won
[04:16:23] I guess two maybe but it's usually one
[04:16:27] we also had a revive
[04:16:30] I don't know
[04:16:44] These Boots are so bad dude we need
[04:16:45] better boots
[04:16:47] someday I also need a better two-piece
[04:16:50] I'm probably gonna spam the world seven
[04:16:53] just to get [ __ ] not what is it
[04:16:56] called the ruling Arena
[04:16:58] that was fun I enjoyed this
[04:17:00] I'm gonna end now but in a dare do we'll
[04:17:03] begin to stream and then probably
[04:17:04] another stream at some point soon
[04:17:05] because I don't want to do more of this
[04:17:07] so I'll let you guys know thanks for
[04:17:08] watching I love you guys I appreciate
[04:17:10] you all being here uh with that said
