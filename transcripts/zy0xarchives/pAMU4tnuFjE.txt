[00:09:45] did like a self-test so I was not a
[00:09:48] family over they all dipped my dad just
[00:09:49] dipped uh I don't really care if I have
[00:09:52] it I just don't want to give it to

[00:09:54] so we're fine
[00:09:56] um
[00:09:58] yeah I have the [ __ ] test here I
[00:10:00] don't know why it's still on my desk but
[00:10:02] yeah this is really so I'm I'm [ __ ] it

[00:10:09] I'm fine my my right ear can barely hear
[00:10:12] uh but outside of that I'm good

[00:10:43] out right after so yeah nice outro dude
[00:10:46] dude dude dude dude dude your favorites
[00:10:51] being taser or electrocharged and also
[00:10:53] pretty much any dendro team thanks so
[00:10:56] much for watching I hope this fistful
[00:10:58] guide was helpful and as always I will
[00:11:00] catch you guys in the next one peace
[00:11:04] reversed
[00:11:06] dude brought no golden troop before
[00:11:09] forward oh yeah that's why I recorded
[00:11:10] here because golden troop wasn't even
[00:11:11] out by then early to get the most
[00:11:14] but yeah
[00:11:15] um
[00:11:16] dude I re-uploaded this video like
[00:11:19] I re-uploaded the entire video
[00:11:21] to add a little line of text this
[00:11:24] because well I mean it was like private
[00:11:27] before us it's like anyone saw it but uh
[00:11:29] I didn't mention that the A4 a 0.5 cool
[00:11:32] announce I added it there [ __ ] just
[00:11:34] for that one line attacks that No One's
[00:11:36] Gonna read
[00:11:37] I almost reveled it again because I
[00:11:40] trimmed the hyperbloom part here where I
[00:11:42] said team that wants in a Wheels is very
[00:11:44] but even there you can use off-field DPS
[00:11:46] in pretty much any team that can fit her
[00:11:49] any team that wants an electrical unit
[00:11:50] will almost all official as either the
[00:11:52] best option or one of the best options
[00:11:54] the main exception being hyperloom but
[00:11:56] even though you can use her I wanted to
[00:11:58] add like because I trimmed it because I
[00:11:59] used to talk here for like two minutes
[00:12:00] the second was two minutes longer but I
[00:12:02] was like I'll just talk about time room
[00:12:03] later in the video but I I in Hinds like
[00:12:05] I kind of want to like re-export it by
[00:12:07] just putting like you like use sucrose
[00:12:10] here like using a Nemo with official
[00:12:11] don't only official but I talk about it
[00:12:13] for like like later in the video so
[00:12:15] whatever all right anyways yeah so
[00:12:17] that's that
[00:12:18] um
[00:12:27] keep up the good work
[00:12:37] anyways
[00:12:39] hey how are you doing I'm doing good
[00:12:42] um
[00:12:43] the official vein here horrible guide my
[00:12:46] bad man but I'm a bit tired uh but I
[00:12:50] felt like I hadn't seen so long I got a
[00:12:51] stream today so we're gonna do like
[00:12:53] three four hours uh and then never let's
[00:12:56] release on the fifth of Tuesday will be
[00:13:00] the big stream we're gonna do a lot so
[00:13:02] the first thing we're actually I think
[00:13:03] I'm gonna be doing viewer pulls for the
[00:13:06] first time ever but only 10 accounts
[00:13:08] because I have to test them out after
[00:13:10] and I think I'm doing this with another
[00:13:12] streamer I don't know if they're gonna
[00:13:14] say so I'm not gonna say anything but
[00:13:16] that might happen so much dark Discord
[00:13:17] we're gonna pick 10 accounts
[00:13:20] um a little bit of your post for like an
[00:13:21] hour to two hours and then right after
[00:13:23] we're gonna do Neville leveling which
[00:13:27] will probably take [ __ ] five years
[00:13:28] who knows maybe he needs math that
[00:13:31] already in the game that he did he
[00:13:32] doesn't but well like there's no way
[00:13:34] there's not anyways we'll see
[00:13:36] um we'll see and then we'll level him
[00:13:38] we'll get that already and then we'll go
[00:13:40] play him and hopefully that won't take
[00:13:42] too long and then we'll have a good
[00:13:44] stream now with that in mind
[00:13:46] uh the viewer polls will be for the
[00:13:49] first hour or two hope that doesn't take
[00:13:50] too much so yeah also I opened cursed
[00:13:53] account reviews uh uh forms in the
[00:13:55] Discord if you wanna join special
[00:13:56] Discord account reviews are going to
[00:13:58] happen anyways I'll shut up oh live
[00:13:59] stream you guys enjoy the sponsor stream
[00:14:01] dude I also write a bank
[00:14:03] the Apparently I think it went well
[00:14:06] though ww [ __ ] dude the only thing okay
[00:14:10] for the first hour it was laggy because
[00:14:13] so
[00:14:15] whatever I fixed it because I'm clutch
[00:14:17] but after I fixed it because I have to
[00:14:18] stream through like my OBS camera but
[00:14:20] for the first hour it was just like
[00:14:21] share screening my like I don't know
[00:14:23] what I was doing like pulling from my
[00:14:24] desktops was like lagging whatever it
[00:14:26] doesn't matter but other than that
[00:14:29] um it was pretty pog
[00:14:31] the only the only thing I was afraid of
[00:14:32] is okay here's the problem with like you

[00:14:38] all of gentian emotes are like balls

[00:21:53] unleash a vertical cut that deals cryo
[00:21:56] damage
[00:21:58] from levels one to three shattering
[00:22:01] pressure will unleash a vertical cut
[00:22:02] alongside pair to deal cryo and didn't

[00:23:07] for him him I'm excited for Risley
[00:23:09] depending on how he plays because
[00:23:11] characters that use their fists
[00:23:12] historically are either really cool or
[00:23:14] really [ __ ] boring so we'll see how
[00:23:16] he is uh I hope he's good because if
[00:23:19] he's bad then Risley Mains are gonna
[00:23:20] have to defend him and be like well I
[00:23:22] actually don't care about meta and meta
[00:23:24] players suck which is fair but just
[00:23:27] don't talk about me if I'm talking about
[00:23:29] meta I shut the [ __ ] up but I also think
[00:23:31] he looks really cool so I really like
[00:23:33] him so I'm excited for both of them uh
[00:23:35] also I'm excited for for [ __ ]
[00:23:37] chlorine and I'm excited for [ __ ] uh
[00:23:39] Farina who's probably the second patch
[00:23:42] and I can't wait so yeah that's like
[00:23:45] four cool characters and then yeah
[00:23:51] chlorine I don't want to say client
[00:23:53] chlorindi
[00:23:56] why do your miamis always make this
[00:23:58] about yomiya Veer 10 says you hate
[00:24:02] yomiya when did I mention her when when
[00:24:05] did I say her name
[00:24:07] this is not about her
[00:24:14] anyways no I don't hate her

[00:24:48] and then he replied with an emoji so I
[00:24:50] have to play cyano unfortunate I mean
[00:24:53] not unfortunate I love Zano he's not
[00:24:54] benched
[00:24:57] tell us about your trip
[00:24:59] um I went to a wedding and then
[00:25:01] beforehand I went to tour Apartments to
[00:25:04] see because we might need I might need a
[00:25:06] temporary place but I'm not gonna leave
[00:25:08] here just like we can talk about that
[00:25:10] later because I don't know what's
[00:25:12] happening yet and then after I went to
[00:25:14] you uh this is my brother in Toronto and
[00:25:17] then I came back home I mean and then I
[00:25:19] got sick so I've just been dead
[00:25:21] parasocially I'm not leaving
[00:25:26] um oh new banners oh yeah okay yeah yeah
[00:25:29] yeah yeah yeah yeah okay there's new
[00:25:30] banners there's new matters doesn't
[00:25:31] matter this matters new matters new
[00:25:33] banners new matters it matters okay
[00:25:34] first of all Nave yet
[00:25:36] look at them just look at them if you
[00:25:37] don't pull for him after looking at him
[00:25:38] you need to ask yourself what's wrong
[00:25:41] with you uh hutau
[00:25:43] we love oh oops we love hotel in this
[00:25:45] household know who Tau slander will be
[00:25:47] tolerated
[00:25:49] not yet
[00:25:51] been for the four stars Diana you can go
[00:25:54] [ __ ] yourself no one no one cares about
[00:25:55] you uh official really good
[00:25:58] official's great official's broken I
[00:25:59] just released a official guide she's
[00:26:01] using basically every [ __ ] team that
[00:26:03] wants an electro with the main exception
[00:26:05] being hyperloom but even then you can
[00:26:08] use her with an email option and just in
[00:26:10] general official's just great broken
[00:26:11] also not just what's important about
[00:26:13] banners is not just that the character
[00:26:14] is good but also that their
[00:26:15] constellations are good official one of
[00:26:17] the best c6s in the game in terms of
[00:26:18] four stars really nice same with Synchro
[00:26:22] arguably top one top two top three unit
[00:26:25] in the game not top three but top one or
[00:26:28] two uh and very good gets better with
[00:26:31] constellations every single one of the
[00:26:32] constellations kind of accepts C1
[00:26:34] although the more you place in control
[00:26:35] the more you're like I got a Lexi one
[00:26:37] but basically every other constellation
[00:26:39] is like insane
[00:26:41] um
[00:26:43] so both of these if you don't have the
[00:26:45] c6s amazing to get diona
[00:26:48] um decent character the main thing with
[00:26:50] that one is like a lot of people have
[00:26:52] her and then it's like her conversations
[00:26:53] are kind of whatever and she's not like
[00:26:55] particularly amazing but she gives you a
[00:26:57] lot of energy for like freeze themes
[00:26:58] cryo teams whatever pretty good the main
[00:27:00] thing I don't like is like you don't
[00:27:01] really need her constellations because
[00:27:03] like her C6 is a fake buff it's like wow
[00:27:05] 200 em but then any team that plays
[00:27:07] diona doesn't need the 200 em
[00:27:09] there's literally the only teams that
[00:27:11] okay there's good teams that don't use
[00:27:15] Dynasty six and then there's teams that
[00:27:18] are like a character that like two
[00:27:20] people main they're like actually I play
[00:27:22] yenfey with diona and it's like no you
[00:27:24] don't know the [ __ ] you don't maybe you
[00:27:25] play Yen Faye you're not you're not
[00:27:27] using that
[00:27:28] maybe you do maybe you do if you do
[00:27:29] that's cool
[00:27:31] like it could you could use it like
[00:27:33] because freeze teams don't care about
[00:27:34] the em and then fridge is playing like
[00:27:35] Kaya instead of Diana and then like
[00:27:37] hutau it needs to be above 50 HP sorry
[00:27:41] under and I want to C6 needs to be over
[00:27:43] 50 so it doesn't work so it's like for
[00:27:44] like the Luke players and like maybe yoy
[00:27:46] Mia if you're playing download with you
[00:27:48] and me about why you're playing down
[00:27:49] over Bennett or yunjin or [ __ ] anyone
[00:27:51] and then it's like yeah so it is what it
[00:27:53] is but it's cool
[00:27:56] um
[00:27:57] yeah uh and then hutau is the same thing
[00:28:01] well same Banner but it's a Tau so if
[00:28:03] you want hotao then hutao
[00:28:07] and then the weapon Banner
[00:28:10] is [ __ ] insane outside of whatever
[00:28:13] the [ __ ] the minestrone waltzes what is
[00:28:16] this weapon called it's garbage but I
[00:28:18] forgot it's called minus strawsel Waltz
[00:28:21] what the [ __ ] is it called it
[00:28:23] autocorrected to Minecraft Waltz
[00:28:26] what the [ __ ] is this
[00:28:29] [Music]
[00:28:47] well
[00:28:52] um
[00:28:55] in all seriousness no in case you were
[00:28:57] wondering the honest C6 seems good on
[00:28:59] paper but most of Dallas teams can't
[00:29:00] utilize it
[00:29:02] okay sorry yeah but for a lot better
[00:29:04] like this order looks insane by the way
[00:29:06] so the the [ __ ] Waltz thing is
[00:29:07] garbage but everything else insane so
[00:29:11] um let's start with the four stars
[00:29:13] actually that's not true I lied
[00:29:15] disclaimer is garbage but the other
[00:29:17] stuff everything let me go through them
[00:29:19] one by one uh let me pull up so I
[00:29:22] already recorded a video on this this is
[00:29:23] the thumbnail not on the web Banner but
[00:29:25] on the new weapons so that's coming out
[00:29:28] tomorrow bye
[00:29:30] this is HP H Ford whoa poggers fat chest
[00:29:33] and it wasn't leaks by the way because
[00:29:35] they were literally announced they were
[00:29:37] literally announced they were literally
[00:29:39] announced
[00:29:45] um oh what is this
[00:29:50] I'm from an A I'm a diver oh no I'm
[00:29:53] drowning
[00:29:55] so you know
[00:29:56] oh you know okay so this is what the 4.1
[00:29:59] weapons do they uh posted a like blog
[00:30:01] post so
[00:30:02] I'm sorry ignore that so yeah so does
[00:30:05] tome of Eternal flow this [ __ ] is insane
[00:30:08] for um
[00:30:09] what we suspect never let is gonna do
[00:30:12] how would we know but you know probably
[00:30:15] um so 80 acre damage very good it's
[00:30:17] basically a uh Aqua simulacra but
[00:30:19] Catalyst uh the main drawback is that
[00:30:22] the weapon
[00:30:23] good
[00:30:28] isn't as universal as like aqueous
[00:30:30] Miracle because oxalaka gives you 20
[00:30:32] damage Wellness to anything here you get
[00:30:33] HP percent which is great and then
[00:30:35] charge hack damage which is great
[00:30:37] but not for every character and it's
[00:30:39] only when your HP increase their
[00:30:40] decreases so unless like
[00:30:43] there's
[00:30:45] okay
[00:30:46] I need to talk about something
[00:30:48] I need to talk about something because
[00:30:50] I don't cover leaks but whenever I guess
[00:30:52] something and it's like very predictable
[00:30:55] but there's like leaks that are trending
[00:30:56] people think it's because of the leaks
[00:30:57] listen I recorded two days ago I don't
[00:31:00] know what the [ __ ] Farina does okay I
[00:31:02] know there's like oh kids got leaked I
[00:31:03] don't care I don't look at that but
[00:31:05] two days ago I recorded when this was
[00:31:07] announced I recorded this looks like it
[00:31:10] would be good on other characters if
[00:31:11] there's a mechanic from someone that
[00:31:13] would increase or decrease your HP I
[00:31:15] don't know what the [ __ ] Farina does but
[00:31:16] there's a good chance that she probably
[00:31:17] [ __ ] with her HP because she's a
[00:31:19] [ __ ] hydraulicon there's a chest it
[00:31:21] could be wrong hopefully I'm wrong so
[00:31:22] you guys know that I'm just guessing but
[00:31:24] assuming that's true this will probably
[00:31:26] be good on many characters because you
[00:31:27] guys are having susk I'm probably right
[00:31:29] but I literally don't know the proof of
[00:31:31] this is I recorded this a day ago
[00:31:34] look let me pull it up without showing
[00:31:36] you guys
[00:31:37] um
[00:31:39] uh
[00:31:45] how do I show the recording data this
[00:31:49] look at this look at this this was
[00:31:51] recorded hey hey what's up okay you
[00:31:54] don't listen to that this is recorded 8
[00:31:56] 48 a.m on 09 22. that was three days ago
[00:32:00] this was recorded three days ago
[00:32:02] this was recorded three days ago and
[00:32:05] literally in the video I'm like you know
[00:32:07] there's probably gonna be a character
[00:32:08] who's gonna [ __ ] with your HP for Fontan
[00:32:10] so it's literally you can't be like oh
[00:32:12] leaks because they weren't even out by
[00:32:13] then and I don't look at them so that's
[00:32:15] just what I'm saying that's all I'm
[00:32:16] saying that's literally all I'm saying
[00:32:18] that's all I'm saying anyways
[00:32:21] with that in mind probably right
[00:32:25] so if that's true then this could be
[00:32:26] good on more characters but even then
[00:32:28] most like there's not that many charge
[00:32:30] attacks Batman catalysts like you could
[00:32:32] like scar up
[00:32:34] but in general this looks like this is
[00:32:36] really good for naviette for other stuff
[00:32:38] who knows right other characters who
[00:32:39] knows
[00:32:41] um
[00:32:42] other weapons
[00:32:44] uh yeah we got an HP sword
[00:32:47] which is great
[00:32:49] um does it look like an attack on Titan
[00:32:51] budget ass disgusting weapon yes it
[00:32:53] matches Levi it matches [ __ ] Mikasa
[00:32:57] does it match anyone in genshin no would
[00:32:59] I put this on my nilu
[00:33:02] no maybe the HP stat makes it her best
[00:33:05] four star
[00:33:07] is it very disrespectful because it's
[00:33:09] ugly yes
[00:33:10] up to you
[00:33:12] I think nilu deserves better
[00:33:20] Layla if you
[00:33:22] want Rara for a stronger Shield uh if
[00:33:25] you use this on Bennett stop it that's
[00:33:27] bad
[00:33:28] uh if you use it on
[00:33:30] um cookie
[00:33:32] here okay you can but only I like R5
[00:33:35] because okay so HP makes a company sure
[00:33:39] but Google mostly wants em to carry in a
[00:33:41] hyperloom team but the problem is you're
[00:33:43] the effect here will give you a em or
[00:33:46] the additional part is that the effect
[00:33:47] gives you Em Right it gives you 40 em
[00:33:50] stacking up to three times so up to 120.
[00:33:52] at R5 it's probably double we can assume
[00:33:55] 120 times two that's 240. and 240 em is
[00:33:59] better than Iron's thing that's a lot so
[00:34:00] it would seem better problem is it's
[00:34:03] hard to practice the first rotation
[00:34:04] because it only the way you stack it is
[00:34:06] you either heal or get healed with
[00:34:08] cookie you can heal but if you use your
[00:34:10] skill and you want to get the buff for
[00:34:12] your skill you can't get at the first
[00:34:13] rotation but it also works when you
[00:34:15] burst so you could skill heal three
[00:34:17] times and then burst and then you get
[00:34:19] the buff but it's kind of weird to proc
[00:34:21] it lasts 10 seconds out of 15. it's not
[00:34:23] your full rotation and then only at R5
[00:34:25] would it be more em than iron sting
[00:34:28] I don't recognize yeah it's okay for
[00:34:31] cookie but it's mostly an HP sword
[00:34:34] um
[00:34:36] yeah I still assume like in theory if
[00:34:40] it's R5 it'll do better than iron sting
[00:34:41] but only has 10 seconds off time out of
[00:34:43] 15 and cookies e lasts the whole
[00:34:46] duration well it's 12 but then uh 15
[00:34:48] with C2
[00:34:50] but anyways
[00:34:52] anyways uh so yeah pretty cool HP sword
[00:34:55] finally
[00:34:56] then this weapon a portable saw Claymore
[00:34:59] so if you don't know an HP Claymore is
[00:35:02] not the same value as an HV sword that's
[00:35:04] all you need to know next weapon uh
[00:35:06] Ballad of the boundless blue
[00:35:10] okay I literally recorded a whole video
[00:35:12] about these weapons now I feel like I'm
[00:35:13] spoiling my video it's gonna be out
[00:35:15] tomorrow go watch it
[00:35:20] wait it's not even the weapon matter but
[00:35:21] this is the event weapon it's pretty
[00:35:23] good I mean it's okay
[00:35:28] um it gives you a [ __ ] on a normal
[00:35:29] chargeback damage and ER
[00:35:37] it's weird it's like it's like it's kind
[00:35:40] of like the rocket Hills but Lucas gives
[00:35:41] you a [ __ ] attack this weapon it
[00:35:44] gives you a [ __ ] on normal charge hack
[00:35:45] damage which looks good and I already
[00:35:47] talked I talk about this in the video
[00:35:48] but basically it's like for a lot of the
[00:35:49] characters that are in the game now if
[00:35:51] you're an on-field DPS that wants a
[00:35:52] normal chargeback damage you're like oh
[00:35:54] cool but then it's like okay but what is
[00:35:56] this 30 ER gonna do Scara on field
[00:35:58] unless your C2 doesn't really need much
[00:35:59] ER like he can use it it's fine but it's
[00:36:02] kind of like whatever and then Hazel
[00:36:04] doesn't really need the like you're not
[00:36:06] really going for an ER weapon on him
[00:36:07] yenfei is not really going like yanfe
[00:36:09] can use some ER but usually your teams
[00:36:11] have like Bennett and then you don't
[00:36:12] really need it and then someone like uh
[00:36:16] yai Miko doesn't really want normal to
[00:36:18] charge that compared to like skill and
[00:36:19] burst same with like
[00:36:22] [Music]
[00:36:22] um
[00:36:23] it's okay it's like okay like if you
[00:36:25] need the ER and need the stats it's good
[00:36:27] and the base tag is high so it's fine
[00:36:29] but a lot of characters don't need the
[00:36:30] ER probably never can use this but
[00:36:34] um We're not gonna talk about that
[00:36:36] because
[00:36:38] We're not gonna talk about that place
[00:36:39] out but also like isn't there like a
[00:36:42] craftable HP weapon that's an HP weapon
[00:36:44] that also gives you energy and heals
[00:36:46] your team that looks pretty [ __ ] good
[00:36:48] I kind of like prototype Amber we'll see
[00:36:51] um anyways so yeah we're talking about
[00:36:53] the weapon matter why am I talking about
[00:36:55] that weapon I don't know so uh now that
[00:36:58] we know what the weapons do
[00:37:03] you can use it on her but why would you
[00:37:05] use it over some of the other weapons
[00:37:06] like for example
[00:37:08] I mean
[00:37:09] it's fine
[00:37:11] so okay here's the thing wrong
[00:37:14] at least the way I when I actually
[00:37:16] played ning Wong a lot I felt like
[00:37:18] you're quick swapping more than you're
[00:37:19] just spamming your normal attacks like
[00:37:21] you're using a lot of your abilities
[00:37:22] your charge attacking whatever but
[00:37:23] you're not just like staying on field
[00:37:24] the whole time and on top of that
[00:37:25] usually you play her in a Geo team and
[00:37:27] then when you do
[00:37:29] and her birth yeah her wrist is really
[00:37:30] low energy cost on top of that you don't
[00:37:32] need all the ER you don't [ __ ] need
[00:37:34] 30 ER anything long
[00:37:36] and so it's like this is better options
[00:37:41] so
[00:37:44] who can use the Fab book quite a few
[00:37:45] characters Mona on Phil nahida anyone
[00:37:48] else if your ER is low I like it mostly
[00:37:50] for Mona but a few other characters can
[00:37:51] use it
[00:37:52] basically if you have a callous
[00:37:54] character and you're like damn I need
[00:37:55] energy you can use it
[00:38:04] sucrose driver sucrose driver usually
[00:38:06] wants like hakushin ring and like
[00:38:09] Elektra teams or you could throwing
[00:38:10] Tails or sack frag I I wouldn't go Fab
[00:38:13] on it on her
[00:38:15] I'm sure there's like a [ __ ]
[00:38:17] simulated rotation where fav is good on
[00:38:19] sucrose but like
[00:38:21] that makes me want to scream so I I
[00:38:23] wouldn't
[00:38:30] why he's having hokushin ring aware is
[00:38:33] it because we have to kill someone to
[00:38:34] get it anyways okay so yeah right now
[00:38:38] this five stars so Tome is good but it's
[00:38:40] like pretty strictly navile right now
[00:38:42] unless you want to play another charge
[00:38:44] hacking Catalyst and you can manipulate
[00:38:45] your HP through another source Homa
[00:38:48] amazing you know why I don't need to
[00:38:50] talk about it it's just good
[00:38:52] uh the official's weapon nobody knows
[00:38:55] what it does and if you do seek help
[00:38:57] it's terrible HP sword is an HP sword
[00:39:00] that's good five Lance that's five lands
[00:39:01] that's good five codex is one of the
[00:39:03] worst stop what no that's not true
[00:39:05] Falcon X is like kind of Niche but it's
[00:39:06] good it's good it's good it's good on
[00:39:08] Mona it's good on a few catalysts but
[00:39:10] like you don't use it that much
[00:39:12] um
[00:39:15] hmm
[00:39:19] you can use it on mostly it's for like
[00:39:22] Mona or onfield nahida mostly
[00:39:25] and it's good like if you can use it
[00:39:27] it's good but usually there's just
[00:39:29] really good callous options for so many
[00:39:30] characters uh whereas five Lance is like
[00:39:32] sick and then the Claymore sucks so I
[00:39:35] guess
[00:39:37] both bosses are great and then three
[00:39:39] four stars are good the HP sword first
[00:39:42] ever four star HP sword that's huge five
[00:39:44] lands that's huge and then five codex if
[00:39:47] you need it
[00:39:48] and then the claymore's kind of ass and
[00:39:50] the bows kind of ass
[00:40:03] yeah of course
[00:40:05] I don't think there's a single damage
[00:40:07] dealing pole arm character that can't
[00:40:10] use Houma
[00:40:11] pretty sure every DPS or even like
[00:40:13] damage dealing support okay no one look
[00:40:16] at Madison uh uh Paul arm can use Homa
[00:40:18] and like likes it like there's no one
[00:40:20] that's like [ __ ] Houma other than Mikey
[00:40:23] like yeah yeah but
[00:40:25] like we can use homo
[00:40:28] Rosario can use Homa shenha doesn't
[00:40:30] really oh she wants attack or ER so not
[00:40:33] chanha uh Zhang leave your Bristol
[00:40:35] forward but that's kind of outdated Homa
[00:40:38] who talking he's homo writing his homo
[00:40:39] Sino can technically he's homo he's like
[00:40:42] whatever he said
[00:40:49] yayao can for HP
[00:40:52] yeah I guess so

[00:44:58] about Kellogg's like how Kellogg's like
[00:45:00] [ __ ] what are the non-frosted flakes
[00:45:03] called Corn Flakes how Corn Flakes were
[00:45:05] made to like make you feel nothing and
[00:45:08] like make you not crave anything and
[00:45:10] then stop you from masturbating like
[00:45:11] that's the that's the cornflakes lore
[00:45:13] like it was actually made by like some
[00:45:14] like
[00:45:15] Evangelical like
[00:45:17] anti-masturbation dude I'm not kidding
[00:45:19] by the way that's actually lore but like
[00:45:21] you know how like I'm like wait where's
[00:45:23] the last particle
[00:45:27] anyways I was coping and I was like John
[00:45:29] John Kellogg's made it and then they
[00:45:32] wouldn't believe me so I looked it up
[00:45:33] and then I didn't know the dude's name
[00:45:35] was actually John and then I it's a wait
[00:45:37] what challenge failed wait okay you're

[00:45:48] I
[00:45:54] anyways I didn't know the guy's name was
[00:45:56] actually John Kellogg's so I was like
[00:45:58] joking I was like oh John like I made up
[00:46:00] a name for him so I would look credible
[00:46:02] and then I looked it up and I should you
[00:46:04] not his name is actually John Kellogg's
[00:46:06] so I guessed it randomly
[00:46:10] true

[00:48:21] satisfying and I was gonna claim it

[00:48:24] didn't know what battle pass weapon I
[00:48:26] wanted to get so I couldn't decide
[00:48:27] because I'm very indecisive I'm the type
[00:48:29] of guy that takes longer to figure out
[00:48:31] what he wants to do than actually spend
[00:48:33] time doing anything
[00:48:35] it's not gonna have like three tasks to
[00:48:38] do I'll think about which one of the
[00:48:40] three to do and then end up not doing
[00:48:41] any of them when I would have had enough

[00:53:21] challenging I can't wait to pick it up I
[00:53:23] can't wait to because oh my God I am so
[00:53:26] smart I play worse sometimes on purpose
[00:53:29] so that new players starting the game
[00:53:31] think it's hard so that when they do
[00:53:33] well they're like oh my God I'm so good
[00:53:35] and then they keep playing and then they
[00:53:38] become gotcha addicts aware

[00:55:05] I tweeted about this
[00:55:07] but um
[00:55:08] look
[00:55:10] you guys remember this weapon
[00:55:12] I thought about it again after
[00:55:14] forgetting about it and then remembering
[00:55:15] it and then forgetting about it I want
[00:55:17] it so bad I need it I think I'm gonna
[00:55:20] fish off stream and get it I'm gonna use
[00:55:21] it on like Yolanda or something it's
[00:55:22] it's bad it's not good but because the
[00:55:25] effect of it is so bad I don't actually
[00:55:27] need to refine it and since I don't need
[00:55:29] to refine it it's easy to fish for
[00:55:31] and I think it would look funny
[00:55:34] are these are my venti that's not a bad
[00:55:35] idea I mean it is a bad idea you
[00:55:37] shouldn't use it on venti but

[01:00:48] yeah I did it all right level 50.
[01:00:51] finally with three hours left easy easy
[01:00:55] clout easy clap
[01:00:57] um
[01:01:01] so I'm gonna claim it all in one click
[01:01:03] the only things we've claimed are a few
[01:01:05] of the wishes but none of the actual
[01:01:06] resources so it's gonna be very
[01:01:07] satisfying now the battle pass weapon I
[01:01:10] still don't know but I'll run through my
[01:01:12] thought process with you guys so first
[01:01:15] of all we want a guide to I don't know
[01:01:18] maybe admonition I only have one which
[01:01:21] means I'm probably gonna use it so sure
[01:01:23] um
[01:01:24] yeah admission again uh I don't know
[01:01:27] I'll just click on a random one let's
[01:01:28] just say Equity uh shut up let's move on
[01:01:30] okay now about weapon obviously I'm
[01:01:33] gonna get a new one uh obviously I'm
[01:01:35] gonna get a new one now um which one I
[01:01:38] wanna get
[01:01:40] is weird because look I think this is
[01:01:44] the coolest one oh this menu is sick
[01:01:46] what the [ __ ] wait since when this is
[01:01:48] new this is actually new yo this is new
[01:01:54] anyways
[01:01:55] Ballad of the for Jordy uh is the sick
[01:01:59] as well I think this looks sick it's a
[01:02:00] [ __ ] tried it it's sick style of the
[01:02:03] Blazing Sun
[01:02:04] I don't give a [ __ ] about Talking Stick
[01:02:06] more like talking [ __ ] uh wolfang is
[01:02:08] great and I really want it and
[01:02:10] sacrificial yade uh has a lot of stats
[01:02:13] now the problem is
[01:02:15] the problem with sacrificial Aid is that
[01:02:18] right now there's no character in the
[01:02:20] game that can use it but I'm just I'm
[01:02:22] assuming like okay the trailer basically
[01:02:25] told us hey naviette wants HP it told us
[01:02:28] in the official trailer they told us so
[01:02:30] if that's true
[01:02:32] then HP and create boom right
[01:02:35] boom
[01:02:39] um
[01:02:45] so obviously big big boy
[01:02:48] Nuvi
[01:02:50] but I'm gonna pull for his weapon for
[01:02:52] sure right there's no world where I
[01:02:54] don't pull for his weapon right
[01:03:00] I mean
[01:03:06] wipe it better Andy because here's the
[01:03:08] thing
[01:03:09] let's say I'm like okay I wanna R5 a
[01:03:12] sacrificial Jade it's gonna take do you
[01:03:14] guys know any [ __ ] patches it's gonna
[01:03:16] take it's gonna be [ __ ] not Lan look
[01:03:19] I'm gonna get one of these that's one
[01:03:20] two and then maybe let's say like one of
[01:03:22] the other weapons that's a talking stick
[01:03:24] cause I'm funny haha that's three then
[01:03:26] Sacramento I need five five plus three
[01:03:28] that's eight patches that means 4.8
[01:03:32] four point [ __ ] eight at the end of
[01:03:34] it
[01:03:36] end of 4.8 if that even happens I'll
[01:03:39] have a R5 Jade and then at that point
[01:03:41] it's gonna be [ __ ] 5.0
[01:03:54] so
[01:03:55] I kind of wanna we'll thank
[01:04:00] wolfang meow
[01:04:07] cause I'm not gonna get five Jades in a
[01:04:10] row like if I want to R5 it I would get
[01:04:12] at least one of like a few other weapons
[01:04:13] first
[01:04:18] you have lighter foliar incision yes
[01:04:21] but I also play do you know how many
[01:04:23] sword characters I play listen I'm not
[01:04:24] even gonna look I'm not even gonna look

[01:04:28] character I use ready watch singtel
[01:04:29] kitchen Bennett
[01:04:32] ayaka ayato Al Haytham kind of gene

[01:04:46] because I don't use her yet
[01:04:49] did I say Syncro I think I said thing
[01:04:51] show
[01:04:52] damn is anyone maybe denture MC but I
[01:04:54] used to Fab on them

[01:05:18] play G that much so like let's say let's
[01:05:19] say 12.
[01:05:32] has like the reject Albedo weapon but
[01:05:34] only Albedo uses
[01:05:42] Lynette ding dong
[01:05:45] I guess there's also the net
[01:05:47] just pick it it's not hard
[01:05:51] that sort is cracked it is pretty good
[01:05:57] soccer visual Jade is also pretty POG
[01:05:59] um but
[01:06:00] I think I'm for sure gonna pull for his
[01:06:03] signature
[01:06:05] everyone's having wolfang meow is Fang
[01:06:07] even here if thanks here I'll get it
[01:06:08] instantly at glitter she's not in chat

[01:06:55] pay her
[01:06:59] okay fine I can only get Talking Stick
[01:07:01] because it's funny and also I think
[01:07:02] Ballad of the federality is visually
[01:07:03] pleasing
[01:07:06] but it's also a strangling weapon
[01:07:09] and a hotel weapon and a sign of weapon
[01:07:15] all right
[01:07:17] wow she's here
[01:07:21] now I kind of don't want to get the wolf
[01:07:23] thing
[01:07:27] David just kill him with the person
[01:07:29] who's by 16 when a skeleton opponent
[01:07:31] incredible decrease by two
[01:07:33] versus zone two stacking up to four
[01:07:36] dimes that's a lot of crit rate
[01:07:39] hello we'll think
[01:07:42] I guess we will take it
[01:07:43] pass rewards everyone uh we'll do
[01:07:47] admonition again we'll do equity and
[01:07:49] we'll do philosophies of equity for no
[01:07:51] uh reason other than I wanna level my
[01:07:53] Lenny I love Lenny
[01:07:59] wait why don't you call me a little rat
[01:08:09] my last moment six or 21 months
[01:08:17] oh we actually did it oh well there is
[01:08:20] Wolfgang
[01:08:22] 2.8 million Maura
[01:08:24] 680 people jumps
[01:08:26] 162 Heroes where it's ten fragile resins
[01:08:31] reminder before you guys type in a w I
[01:08:33] missed out on all of this last battle
[01:08:36] pass when I forgot to claim on the last
[01:08:37] day so all of this I lost I could have
[01:08:40] been three million more or richer for
[01:08:42] the record I could have had three
[01:08:44] million more Mora I paid for I bought
[01:08:46] last battle pass and I forgot to claim
[01:08:55] laughs
[01:09:04] [ __ ] is this
[01:09:09] anyways
[01:09:15] uh we now have a wolf thing which I can
[01:09:18] put on
[01:09:19] Layla I'm not gonna put it on a little
[01:09:22] but we're just gonna wait why is this
[01:09:24] uglier than I thought
[01:09:26] it's kind of thick but like not in a
[01:09:27] good way
[01:09:30] I am regretting everything at least it's
[01:09:32] good damage
[01:09:34] it looks nice but when you level it I
[01:09:36] assume it changes color like every
[01:09:37] weapon does
[01:09:44] all right let's see are you calling me
[01:09:46] ugly no it's the sword I think it's
[01:09:48] pretty it's just like
[01:09:52] let me see
[01:10:04] this is where I changed his colors
[01:10:09] I mean it's Bluer now
[01:10:12] I still think it's like two like
[01:10:32] I mean it's fine
[01:10:34] yeah the base is a bit too thick is what
[01:10:37] I was thinking
[01:10:44] try on Kaya I beg
[01:10:47] thought it was a claim or another
[01:10:48] claimer's Talking Stick
[01:10:50] Talking Stick
[01:10:59] it does look good on Kyle it's also good
[01:11:01] on Kaia
[01:11:04] wait where'd he go
[01:11:12] I mean
[01:11:21] wait why can't I already level this
[01:11:22] weapon what the [ __ ]
[01:11:24] okay let's keep going
[01:11:29] someone type ads like standard wish
[01:11:34] Yes Man standard wish
[01:11:37] I can do them after
[01:11:42] I saw tomorrow
[01:11:45] Mr
[01:11:47] my hands on new villette and do I also
[01:11:51] can't wait to get my hands on them
[01:11:55] use this monster stuff that's why yeah
[01:11:57] it makes sense
[01:12:00] foreign
[01:12:24] listening to Love Sosa cause I love Sosa
[01:12:28] all right let's go do this
[01:12:30] before I forget
[01:12:39] is it good on Albedo
[01:12:42] um
[01:12:43] I mean sure but Cinnabar spindle
[01:13:04] that R5 is better than harbinger of dawn
[01:13:07] R5 you know that's not a metric right
[01:13:10] okay listen if it takes R5 of a new
[01:13:14] battle pass weapon to be better than a
[01:13:16] [ __ ] barely probably I don't know the
[01:13:18] exact number but probably barely better
[01:13:20] than a [ __ ] free three star it's not
[01:13:23] actually better [ __ ] use that [ __ ] on
[01:13:25] someone else
[01:13:31] at least to get that
[01:13:39] oh yeah I guess I should figure out if
[01:13:41] it stocks off field or not that's a good
[01:13:42] question
[01:13:50] it doesn't say it does
[01:13:52] so it might not we'd have to test it
[01:13:55] which I could do
[01:13:57] did anyone test it I could just test it
[01:13:59] later
[01:14:00] uh let's do this
[01:14:04] I could just use it on Kaya then see if
[01:14:05] it increases
[01:14:07] although it's criterate so it's kind of
[01:14:08] hard to well you could probably just
[01:14:09] swap into them and then check his stats
[01:14:11] no it doesn't show in stats yeah it'd be
[01:14:12] hard to test
[01:14:17] it doesn't such
[01:14:23] contest with a hundred crit rate
[01:14:29] you're 100 crit rate
[01:14:32] wait that's it that was the easiest
[01:14:33] commission ever
[01:14:41] I'm from YouTube is he in a booster seat
[01:14:44] when he records
[01:14:46] what does that mean
[01:14:48] what are you even referencing
[01:14:54] like I actually don't even understand
[01:14:56] the funny in that question
[01:15:12] look for aurel and veru
[01:15:20] [ __ ] is
[01:15:22] oh they're hiding it's these [ __ ]

[01:25:32] then log out

[01:25:37] either also if you suppose something
[01:25:38] you'll get banned in a chat just for
[01:25:40] yeah but it's not just that it's also
[01:25:42] it's not just that it's also okay
[01:25:48] also
[01:25:52] also
[01:25:54] no one spoiler tags anything
[01:25:58] also there's a difference in spoiler
[01:26:00] tags between this okay like spoilers
[01:26:03] that that and then you would like put a
[01:26:06] space and then you type stuff that's as
[01:26:07] part of that sure but if you do like
[01:26:08] spoilers
[01:26:11] child dies that is not a spoiler that's
[01:26:14] you're like posting a
[01:26:16] and then they post pictures no one cares
[01:26:18] about your cartoons I'm sorry I'm sorry
[01:26:21] and it's like you're like watching or
[01:26:23] like you'll watch the show like I'm like
[01:26:25] watching like let's say you like
[01:26:26] watching God forbid you watch an anime
[01:26:28] with someone who read the Manga they're
[01:26:30] like oh you like this character
[01:26:32] oh you like this character oh you have
[01:26:35] no idea
[01:26:39] it's over it's over it's over
[01:26:42] it's over
[01:26:44] it's over
[01:26:50] anyways
[01:26:52] all right let's get into this bouncy
[01:27:01] child dies what the [ __ ] I'm telling you
[01:27:04] child is gonna die at some point I've
[01:27:06] been saying this since patch 1.0 and you
[01:27:09] guys will be like when it happens it was
[01:27:11] like oh pre-watched but just know I've
[01:27:13] been calling this for like five years
[01:27:16] shut the [ __ ] up he's never gonna die
[01:27:17] look I love him and I hope he doesn't
[01:27:19] I'm just saying it would be a good like
[01:27:22] Arc to his story like kind of a villain
[01:27:26] character who's kind of a terrorist kind
[01:27:28] of dies to save us and it's like kind of
[01:27:30] a Redemption Arc even though he's still
[01:27:31] a criminal and then it's like whoa
[01:27:37] he will never die
[01:27:39] hopefully not
[01:27:43] is Albedo still worth it
[01:27:45] uh Avid is still pretty fine but just
[01:27:48] keep in mind that at the end of my last
[01:27:50] Albedo video I said that he would get
[01:27:52] more Synergy when more Geo characters
[01:27:55] come out as more geocachers come out and
[01:27:58] that was about a year and a half ago and
[01:27:59] we haven't gotten our Geo character so
[01:28:01] surely Navia is Gonna Save Geo
[01:28:12] Albedo is probably the only Geo
[01:28:15] character outside of Zhong Lee that I
[01:28:17] would use in non-geo teams though
[01:28:18] because he's actually like he's a decent
[01:28:20] Flex slot
[01:28:22] he's he's more like decent to use if you
[01:28:25] have but he's not usually like worth
[01:28:27] pulling for for that last slot but
[01:28:30] no we're getting on board Geo characters
[01:28:33] so
[01:28:38] yunjin I mean
[01:28:40] no like Albedo can fit like 90 of teams
[01:28:44] if you have a flag spot Eugene is good
[01:28:46] and like yoy Mia like the normal
[01:28:48] attackers the like five normal attackers
[01:28:51] well a lot of characters know attack but
[01:28:52] most of the Naruto characters don't want
[01:28:54] to buff their null attacks more than
[01:28:56] like the other parts of their kit or
[01:28:58] then another element in the team
[01:29:04] Advanced store weapon when what does
[01:29:05] that mean am I missing one
[01:29:09] Oh you mean like for old event weapons
[01:29:12] yeah I agree that should be a thing
[01:29:22] wait so Nev can use yunjin what
[01:29:25] he literally Hydro pumps with a [ __ ]
[01:29:28] Hydro a hydrophallic object
[01:29:31] that's not a normal attack
[01:29:42] future
[01:29:43] your sins weigh upon your soul is
[01:29:46] staying condemned you stand condemned
[01:29:56] show your lawn build for emblem
[01:29:59] you're welcome
[01:30:01] you're welcome
[01:30:04] can you explain your 360 resin yeah so
[01:30:06] you know the Xbox 360 I actually
[01:30:08] pioneered that so that was people say
[01:30:11] that was so not the Red Ring of Death
[01:30:12] part where everyone's Xboxes started
[01:30:14] exploding and not working but outside of
[01:30:16] that the technology behind it I actually
[01:30:18] helped Pioneer so in order to celebrate
[01:30:20] its anniversary uh Mr Xbox himself gave
[01:30:24] me 360 resin so it's pretty cool
[01:30:34] my idea but I want to be humble and I'm
[01:30:36] not about like obviously I'm not gonna
[01:30:38] be like yeah give me 360 million like
[01:30:40] even if I deserve it it's kind of weird
[01:30:41] like I'm not trying to be like that so I
[01:30:43] just took 360 resin because I'm very
[01:30:45] selfless so yeah
[01:30:53] so no big deal like you guys don't have
[01:30:55] to look up to me or anything I'm just
[01:30:56] saying
[01:30:58] laughs
[01:31:00] yeah
[01:31:04] take it easy
[01:31:19] yo I knocked my phone over by flicking
[01:31:22] my mouse too much

[01:40:33] DPS to pull for it
[01:40:45] you know that's [ __ ] up chat do you

[01:49:04] Vermillion but two years ago
[01:49:15] ER mod check
[01:49:17] dude I don't need ER on my [ __ ] Chow
[01:49:19] stop it stop it
[01:49:22] I was C1
[01:49:28] also I did you clear everything in one
[01:49:31] [ __ ] rotation who cares
[01:49:32] back then the the abyss dude Abyss was
[01:49:35] two Rune guards I would speedrun floor
[01:49:38] 12-3-1 in 11 seconds I cleared it 11. I
[01:49:42] remember speed running it 11 seconds
[01:49:45] that's what it was
[01:49:49] let's Light It Up
[01:49:59] surely see one doesn't allow you to have
[01:50:01] 105 ER I mean okay unironically you can
[01:50:03] get away with like
[01:50:05] yeah you can but you need three Nemo or
[01:50:07] like Fab
[01:50:08] and like 90 of my teams have that so
[01:50:11] there's no reason for me to build more
[01:50:12] than like 110 120.
[01:50:23] I don't know I feel like there's no
[01:50:24] point to just like get ER because it's
[01:50:26] like a sub stat
[01:50:34] s
[01:50:42] um
[01:50:52] do you think that he will ever be strong
[01:50:54] on a character other than nilu it
[01:50:55] already is she's already really good
[01:50:56] like okay I kind of underrated key but I
[01:51:00] still don't think
[01:51:01] I think he is not worth pulling
[01:51:05] because you can oftentimes just go like
[01:51:07] fast but you can use it on like cookie
[01:51:09] because it can give you like emboss uh
[01:51:12] let's get on nilu
[01:51:20] yeah that's pretty much it I mean you
[01:51:22] could also use HP for like Kirara or
[01:51:24] Layla but
[01:51:26] I wouldn't if you're pulling key for a
[01:51:29] stronger shield on the four star that
[01:51:31] has the strongest shield that is
[01:51:33] incredible skill issue
[01:51:38] and you use on cookie
[01:51:59] yeah yeah
[01:52:10] let's light it up let's Light It Up
[01:52:15] wow 5K bad chest
[01:52:22] solidify you can run but you can't huh
[01:52:33] to the wicked
[01:52:35] huh wait how'd that normal attack not
[01:52:37] hit her what the [ __ ]
[01:52:39] how does how does that look at that how
[01:52:42] does that not hit
[01:52:46] the hitbox is on her
[01:52:54] is he trying to kill the fire crab uh we
[01:52:57] could do it when we get there it's
[01:52:58] basically there's like a fire shield on
[01:53:00] his back you want to apply Hydro there
[01:53:01] you can do it with like I've seen people
[01:53:03] do with Geo you can like kind of Electro
[01:53:05] it cry away whatever but you usually
[01:53:06] want a hydro it's a lot better
[01:53:09] so you want a character that can like
[01:53:10] hit the his like back thing
[01:53:20] or not bad it's like yeah it's like on
[01:53:21] top of them whatever that's called
[01:53:24] I guess that's his back
[01:53:25] head
[01:53:28] uh the [ __ ] is this
[01:53:35] dude I wish there was like presets for
[01:53:37] teams I'm lazy
[01:53:40] I don't feel like thinking about what
[01:53:41] team to play for like four nine ten
[01:53:44] eleven
[01:53:50] Barbara showcase she's not geared right
[01:53:52] now
[01:54:01] I'm just gonna click on characters and
[01:54:03] then hopefully it makes the team
[01:54:06] okay that is a team
[01:54:10] uh
[01:54:13] uh that is definitely a team
[01:54:16] bring Rover oh no but you got scammed I
[01:54:20] don't know what the [ __ ] is
[01:54:22] this is
[01:54:25] down there's one with wind and clouds
[01:54:29] I hacking love cars whoa what the [ __ ]
[01:54:33] guys because I do hugging love casual
[01:54:36] now the real fun begins though look at
[01:54:38] this team
[01:54:40] can get away
[01:54:44] we're playing Super conduct Sino in case
[01:54:47] you're unaware
[01:55:02] he's then contempt We Stand condemned
[01:55:09] yo Friday there's a ton gifted
[01:55:13] um
[01:55:13] appreciate it
[01:55:16] I couldn't get all these guys
[01:55:19] no I can't yeah
[01:55:35] here
[01:55:38] worthless
[01:55:42] useless
[01:55:48] one with nature
[01:55:51] all the needs Adorn my night okay cool
[01:55:55] that was a run
[01:55:56] three days uh sorry the three months I
[01:55:58] take back the ten you made me you made
[01:56:00] me hyper than I thought I you made me
[01:56:02] think I'm not even gonna talk anymore
[01:56:05] I don't know what I'm saying
[01:56:13] time for takeoff
[01:56:18] your sins play upon your soul your
[01:56:21] Peninsula while you play your child like
[01:56:22] C1 ciao because I don't have C6 trial
[01:56:25] unless I want to use it the nice thing
[01:56:26] about C6 trial is that his C2 C3 C4 and
[01:56:29] mostly C5 are complete garbage and
[01:56:31] useless and then C6 doesn't do anything
[01:56:33] unless you actively try to use it so
[01:56:36] it's basically like it lets me play Xiao
[01:56:38] like a normal show unless I actually
[01:56:40] just want to play mc6
[01:56:42] it's like I could toggle the
[01:56:44] constellation
[01:56:45] yeah C4 has okay his C4 has saved me a
[01:56:49] lot I I honestly I am being so I'm being
[01:56:53] so serious right now when I say I think
[01:56:55] the only person who's actually made use
[01:56:57] of shout C4 is me I feel like no one has
[01:57:00] gotten as much value from it
[01:57:02] as I have
[01:57:12] no idea
[01:57:13] worthless sir rotations is more easy
[01:57:15] yeah I guess that's true but
[01:57:22] the one that gives you charge attack
[01:57:23] damage
[01:57:26] this moment will be frozen I think you
[01:57:28] can get away
[01:57:31] I mean the stats are okay
[01:57:37] you don't have anything better I guess
[01:57:39] it seems copying though
[01:57:55] [ __ ] I
[01:57:59] meant to click continue
[01:58:06] wait let me uh we actually have pulls I
[01:58:08] got from the battle pass so let's do
[01:58:10] that okay we only have one well
[01:58:13] I wonder what we'll get whoa a three
[01:58:15] star
[01:58:17] Ferris Shadow that's cool that's nice
[01:58:22] remember to get your freezing show from
[01:58:24] the shop if you have the star glitter
[01:58:26] that is uh that is he is definitely do
[01:58:28] you mean Reagan okay 2K attack but she
[01:58:32] doesn't create
[01:58:35] do you mean Ryden
[01:58:38] Yes actually I made writing let's look
[01:58:40] at my writing so I've arrived in level
[01:58:42] 90 engulfing lightning crowned my IQ
[01:58:45] goes down watching this C2 20 months
[01:58:48] though we're on a 2b's already yeah dude
[01:58:52] look at her HP though 28k not bad hey
[01:58:55] not bad not bad
[01:58:59] 28k not bad
[01:59:04] I don't know I don't know what happened
[01:59:06] to her I don't know Avenger
[01:59:11] she's tanky hey she's tanky
[01:59:20] dude I have too many characters man if
[01:59:23] they release an abyss okay this would be
[01:59:25] [ __ ] for like most players but if they
[01:59:26] release Contour where I could use like
[01:59:28] eight teams I'll be happy if they let me
[01:59:31] let me okay give me a game mode where
[01:59:33] it's like hey if you clear spiral Abyss
[01:59:36] with with every time for floor one to
[01:59:39] twelve each time you use a different
[01:59:41] character and each time you use it get
[01:59:44] this we get like hard mode achievements
[01:59:47] okay if we complete them we get a
[01:59:48] special name card that's like a flex it
[01:59:50] doesn't do anything so it doesn't matter
[01:59:51] if you can't clear it right it doesn't
[01:59:52] [ __ ] matter but get like an animated
[01:59:54] name card so that you know like oh [ __ ]
[01:59:57] and then every time you clear an abyss
[01:59:59] four any character you use is locked
[02:00:02] from every other floor so one to eight
[02:00:04] you have to use throw characters and
[02:00:05] then you have to use different teaser 9
[02:00:06] 10 11 12. now you might be like dude I
[02:00:08] won't be able to do this for like four
[02:00:09] years good now he has something to work
[02:00:11] towards infinite end game content that
[02:00:13] doesn't even involve Primo Gems or
[02:00:15] anything that matters it's just a
[02:00:16] [ __ ] name card no one gives a [ __ ]
[02:00:18] about it or like a pet something boom
[02:00:20] you get like a little slime that follows
[02:00:21] you around call them [ __ ] slimy the
[02:00:23] Slime boom then we have end game and it
[02:00:25] doesn't matter
[02:00:27] and it's not like you're speedrunning
[02:00:29] it's not like you have to wail or
[02:00:30] anything because you could do it in like
[02:00:31] a year it's a [ __ ] name card who
[02:00:33] cares
[02:00:34] or just play another game okay true no
[02:00:37] that's that is an option that is an
[02:00:39] option
[02:00:41] all right floor eleven
[02:00:45] uh we'll play we'll play Hydro pyro sure
[02:00:48] we'll do all Hydro characters
[02:00:50] ayato
[02:00:54] ayato yilon
[02:00:59] shall showcase
[02:01:01] kokomi
[02:01:04] we'll fish out later but not for 11.
[02:01:14] who should I who's the other Hydra
[02:01:15] character let's play synchron I guess
[02:01:22] second off will play
[02:01:25] um let's say who tau is one hotel geared
[02:01:27] I don't know but I would like to hope so
[02:01:30] oh Lenny's geared for sure actually
[02:01:31] we'll play Lenny it's showtime Bennett
[02:01:36] uh Jonathan
[02:01:38] and
[02:01:39] um
[02:01:44] there no we can play dance that Jonathan
[02:01:46] actually and then
[02:01:47] Gaza
[02:01:49] but that's that's too meta of a team
[02:01:50] it's too meta we need to bench Kaza
[02:01:53] hopefully burning [ __ ] it
[02:01:57] I hacking love burning
[02:02:05] oh my God we have to protect the
[02:02:07] monolith I forgot yo yo it's fine this
[02:02:10] seems actually good this is actually
[02:02:11] good it's not even a troll team
[02:02:15] if I was gonna do that so they like
[02:02:17] passively killed them
[02:02:18] I have to go attack these guys
[02:02:27] mind the deluge
[02:02:34] oh
[02:02:38] there's a lot of hydro numbers
[02:02:46] cool
[02:02:54] foreign
[02:02:59] [Music]
[02:03:16] what's the English equivalent of it's
[02:03:18] showtime
[02:03:19] okay I know that sounds dumb to ask but
[02:03:22] like you know like in Japanese it says
[02:03:24] it's showtime what's the English voice
[02:03:27] line for that because we don't like
[02:03:28] usually there's like a translation I
[02:03:30] know it's showtime is English but he
[02:03:31] doesn't say that in English he only says
[02:03:33] I'm Japanese
[02:03:34] so what's the English one
[02:03:38] [Music]
[02:03:42] two and voila
[02:03:49] 54k Daya that has to be a world record
[02:03:51] that has to be a world record
[02:03:59] let's get this show on the road
[02:04:01] I might be it actually
[02:04:10] [ __ ] is this
[02:04:20] on Skyward blade in a team with four
[02:04:23] Hydro characters
[02:04:31] [ __ ] is this rain outlined your face
[02:04:37] my God you highest is 25k and you're
[02:04:40] dead 54k what the [ __ ] okay
[02:04:43] we might have to talk about jurganyu
[02:04:45] before we talk about my day out
[02:04:54] it's all good though
[02:05:05] let's get this show on the road
[02:05:08] Dale wolf Graystone procker dude dude
[02:05:10] dude literally think about it okay let's
[02:05:13] say dude you're playing you're playing
[02:05:14] ciao with with Bennett and far is on
[02:05:17] right let's say there's a character then
[02:05:19] you could add to your team that would
[02:05:20] instantly give you 20 more attack
[02:05:21] because of high residence 20 more attack
[02:05:24] because of tenacity of the Middle with
[02:05:26] and resistance Interruption and 40
[02:05:29] attack with Wolves gravestones passive
[02:05:33] I think that's it actually
[02:05:35] exactly
[02:05:37] exactly it's either that
[02:05:39] or uh Fab hutau support
[02:05:44] because she gives 12 12 or 10 I think 12
[02:05:47] could rate
[02:05:56] you asked for it
[02:06:01] play Toma yeah but Toma like he wouldn't
[02:06:04] need C6 there to actually be better
[02:06:08] okay granted
[02:06:09] I wouldn't recommend they are but I'm
[02:06:12] just saying

[02:07:37] foreign
[02:07:50] I play Star rail aware then I also have
[02:07:53] to like edit gentian and stream engine
[02:07:56] so I don't know if that counts as more
[02:07:57] but there's that uh
[02:08:00] uh I play valorant Here Comes the finale
[02:08:02] from time to time and I also am in a
[02:08:05] group Iron Man with the Jeff odsu and
[02:08:07] slice so four games

[02:08:29] he used to play OverWatch but that's
[02:08:30] just kind of dead
[02:08:32] used to play I might play cookie run
[02:08:34] again
[02:08:37] we will stream variety soon surely
[02:08:43] when what is that oh is that the
[02:08:48] did Fang is playing a Chinese gotcha
[02:08:50] shooter game
[02:08:51] why is your shooter gotcha
[02:09:06] aware

[02:09:37] I mean it looked fun but
[02:09:45] are you seeing the new artifacts out on
[02:09:46] the knee dude I cannot I I don't
[02:09:50] soon I will also I gave my I gave my
[02:09:53] um my I almost said my Fontan I get my
[02:09:56] my fickle my official [ __ ] uh four
[02:09:59] golden Troop because I was sharing
[02:10:01] screen and the Jeff was bullying me for
[02:10:03] on being on two piece two piece but dude
[02:10:04] these sub stats are so bad I look
[02:10:06] [ __ ]
[02:10:07] [ __ ] worse
[02:10:09] worse than
[02:10:12] 20 man what the [ __ ] is this
[02:10:24] like what is this
[02:10:29] the Jeff was like wow this flower is so
[02:10:31] good
[02:10:32] it's like yeah but [ __ ] you like no
[02:10:34] one's happy with this piece
[02:10:38] but yeah
[02:10:39] my maliciously is better though
[02:10:47] this goblet's good I actually this
[02:10:49] goblet grew on me this goblet grow on me
[02:10:51] 84 em attack damage not bad
[02:10:57] I kind of don't want to play stringless
[02:10:58] on her anymore though because I feel
[02:11:00] like at this point our crit ratio looks
[02:11:02] too cooked
[02:11:04] it looks deep fried
[02:11:14] if this look if this rules for damage I
[02:11:16] will buy someone's Chatter's mom a house
[02:11:19] brand new house
[02:11:22] foreign
[02:11:30] instead you get Toyota corolled
[02:11:33] [Music]
[02:11:42] [Music]
[02:11:56] I can't stop it wait one sec one sec I
[02:11:59] don't know how to stop it
[02:12:00] okay I got it
[02:12:04] I'm sorry I
[02:12:07] anyways uh the only problem okay the
[02:12:10] only problem is I don't like that my
[02:12:11] official can use two piece for million
[02:12:13] anymore because now I have one two three
[02:12:15] four five six seven eight nine
[02:12:17] uh Vermillion Sands and I can only use
[02:12:19] like one of them
[02:12:21] maybe two
[02:12:27] aware
[02:12:29] foreign
[02:12:32] what
[02:12:51] okay what are we doing Cal what are we
[02:12:53] doing what are we doing
[02:12:54] I want to use navient but he's not out
[02:12:57] yet so we can play literally anyone I
[02:12:59] don't care who are we playing
[02:13:00] I can play ciao but I already played
[02:13:02] ciao
[02:13:04] play Sino okay
[02:13:07] but who else
[02:13:08] can play nilu
[02:13:11] we are 106 206.
[02:13:15] honestly good enough
[02:13:18] yay Miko I feel like I always play Eye
[02:13:21] though
[02:13:24] intergrational
[02:13:28] okay I'm down to play Child changing but
[02:13:30] only if my child can be I think there's
[02:13:32] a meta of child going on Petra and then
[02:13:34] picking up both Petra I like a hydro and
[02:13:36] a pyro Crystal and then your last slot
[02:13:38] instead of being like Kazo or sucrose is
[02:13:40] wrongly or Albedo and then you play
[02:13:42] Petra on child because he's on field and
[02:13:44] you can pick up the Pyro Crystal
[02:14:13] no wonder he was critting for like
[02:14:16] his burst hit like 50K
[02:14:20] [ __ ] you Lenny
[02:14:24] Chad who has more res linear or child
[02:14:26] what do you think you think has more is
[02:14:30] subscribed again I cannot Escape
[02:14:35] I'm trans if it's split I think Lenny
[02:14:38] probably
[02:14:40] child is like child gets away with more
[02:14:42] because he's like pretty does that make
[02:14:43] sense like child like has it been more
[02:14:46] unspoken risk like it's a bit more
[02:14:47] natural
[02:14:51] laughs
[02:14:53] but Lydia like Lenny's like better
[02:15:02] no l has the most Ruiz
[02:15:05] Noel [ __ ] did Noel do
[02:15:09] I can't even tell you okay this might be
[02:15:12] low-key disrespectful I can't give you
[02:15:14] one singular Noel quote if I tried

[02:15:46] appreciate I got a good nymphs
[02:15:48] we actually got an emphis this is not
[02:15:51] bad
[02:15:53] dude look at
[02:15:57] the two piece at least two piece nymph
[02:16:04] I guess I already have a heart attack
[02:16:05] goblet that's like a heart of death
[02:16:12] zayax have you built could come yet
[02:16:15] because I heard someone having a
[02:16:17] functional bird in marash your sacred
[02:16:19] Comey zero functioning so that a
[02:16:23] functional uh crit management secret
[02:16:25] Comey yes I'm sure it is functional
[02:16:30] but I'm down to play kirkomi
[02:16:32] unironically well ironically but I think
[02:16:34] it would be fun
[02:16:40] okay we have a 87 199 child right now is
[02:16:43] that too much crit rate for child he has
[02:16:44] zero em aware
[02:16:46] I don't want em we're gonna be vaping
[02:16:48] his burst
[02:16:49] because it doesn't really matter
[02:16:52] can you wish me good luck for my exams
[02:16:54] yeah Paul so kazuka has best rizz
[02:16:59] o weapon amount I want [ __ ] harp
[02:17:04] so you go puller wait how much could how
[02:17:06] much could damage out of
[02:17:09] I mean this is actually not bad
[02:17:13] he's not gonna crit yes he will he
[02:17:16] actually has a decent amount of crit
[02:17:18] I'm on a [ __ ] crittery weapon uh and
[02:17:20] and uh and circle it
[02:17:24] can also go stringless
[02:17:28] this is better
[02:17:29] child needs yeah no but you can Vape his
[02:17:31] burst for big PP number
[02:17:39] look at that nah
[02:17:49] Fox help can I use veggies at a Caswell
[02:17:52] for for Causeway teams
[02:17:55] um you can use sucrose sucrose is
[02:17:58] basically the same [ __ ] thing except
[02:18:00] in like a freeze team where you'd want
[02:18:02] Elemental damage and not em then venti
[02:18:04] would be better well he doesn't venge
[02:18:05] doesn't give Elemental damage but Kazo
[02:18:07] does and sucrose gives em so if benty
[02:18:09] would help group
[02:18:11] why do you have 1K defense for one child
[02:18:13] my child is not monkey defense
[02:18:16] okay listen listen bro listen listen
[02:18:19] okay these pieces listen okay listen

[02:18:35] because you don't need luck
[02:18:37] you will succeed
[02:18:40] is my shangling geared
[02:18:43] I need to have a soundboard like button

[02:19:18] have no ER
[02:19:21] should I go to peace two piece [ __ ] it I
[02:19:24] think it'll be funny whatever it's funny
[02:19:26] uh okay we're ready I'm ready we'll play
[02:19:29] Sino and child
[02:19:40] wait I forget how to [ __ ] set up the
[02:19:42] okay let me everyone shut up no one
[02:19:44] laugh at me
[02:19:47] wait where's child
[02:19:49] I mentioned that this is my first time
[02:19:51] watching you live since I usually wait
[02:19:53] from YouTube and everyone told me to
[02:19:55] either get out or run should I be no
[02:19:57] don't be worried don't listen to them
[02:19:58] forget how to set up double Swirl Let me
[02:20:00] see if I get it
[02:20:04] who does this and then
[02:20:07] oh cause there's not on four okay well
[02:20:09] that would have hit that was spamming
[02:20:10] for okay
[02:20:11] Kaza I was spamming four to go to Kaza I
[02:20:14] was doing nothing so I couldn't [ __ ]
[02:20:15] swap
[02:20:20] still on Lo-Fi oh [ __ ] it's like I was
[02:20:23] gone
[02:20:41] give me a second
[02:20:57] we're going to go for a four verodescent
[02:21:00] venerer full em set
[02:21:04] this piece is really good most of my
[02:21:06] causal pieces should be on Lynette
[02:21:08] because I owned them from her raposo
[02:21:11] Lynette
[02:21:14] um
[02:21:15] this one isn't for some reason
[02:21:21] okay we have no ER on any of our
[02:21:23] characters but I think it'll be funnier
[02:21:24] this way we have no ERD on changling no
[02:21:27] ER on Kazo well 160 is not like
[02:21:30] bad bad but
[02:21:32] it's fine
[02:21:34] well the [ __ ] do I play this doofus
[02:21:46] probably first off
[02:21:49] and then second off we play I mean even
[02:21:52] second half he's where do I want to play
[02:21:53] Sino
[02:21:59] I guess
[02:22:03] sec
[02:22:04] ant
[02:22:06] probably I mean even he's fine either
[02:22:08] he's fighting against magu's fine here
[02:22:10] he's fine here he's fine here actually
[02:22:13] fine either it doesn't matter

[02:22:35] God Palio's gonna [ __ ] him up ah yeah I
[02:22:39] mean

[02:22:48] the child's second
[02:22:50] sure
[02:22:52] but we have zero ER in this team so
[02:22:54] there's a chance we're gonna have to
[02:22:55] reset and if we have to reset and it's
[02:22:57] second half
[02:23:00] that will not be fun
[02:23:07] first ever gonna play Sino Nikita yeah

[02:34:55] timing
[02:34:56] why did it take so long to appear dude
[02:34:58] that's I know I was glitched
[02:35:04] like can you sign overs here do

[02:36:09] because that's for losers
[02:36:14] brace yourself [ __ ] it no I wanted a
[02:36:17] funny number I waited for a funny number
[02:36:19] I was like What if I could what if I
[02:36:22] could Vape it for a funny number and

[02:36:42] let's Light It Up
[02:36:47] I have to wait
[02:36:50] I'm gonna eat you
[02:36:53] again here we go this guy
[02:37:09] yeah
[02:37:11] this is [ __ ] child charged on him no
[02:37:14] it's fine are we ready
[02:37:18] what happened hello you guys hear me I
[02:37:21] think I do see it I'm sorry testing

[02:38:06] not gonna kill that
[02:38:15] it's a little rain outlined your face
[02:38:19] surrender
[02:38:34] I can't put a 21 ping
[02:38:41] all right let's not [ __ ] this one up
[02:38:43] okay we have no energy so Hydro swirling
[02:38:45] is probably a waste of time
[02:38:47] because we need to get our burst back
[02:38:49] and doing a Hydra swirl takes away from
[02:38:51] that alt e salty now
[02:38:55] that
[02:38:56] I'm not no I forgot what the ice
[02:39:01] kitchen inside it's okay
[02:39:12] this this this
[02:39:14] again it's doing listen
[02:39:18] if I haven't done this to this in a bit
[02:39:20] okay so I'm a little rusty I'm a little
[02:39:21] rusty I'm a bit rustic
[02:39:29] and then this
[02:39:35] I hate Chinese I hope shangling one day
[02:39:37] she cooks I hope one day cycling is
[02:39:39] cooking right but then accidentally
[02:39:41] pushes Shang Ling into the river she's
[02:39:44] trying to get her ingredients from now
[02:39:46] nothing bad happens to her but she just
[02:39:49] gets soaked in water and then she's like
[02:39:50] oh shucks
[02:39:54] okay I saw someone [ __ ] talking in this
[02:39:56] team comp because I'm playing it
[02:39:57] terribly stop it the team is amazing I
[02:40:00] am just doing right now don't judge the
[02:40:03] team based on whatever the [ __ ] I'm
[02:40:04] doing okay shut the [ __ ] up stop it
[02:40:07] stop it
[02:40:17] my tangling was on life supports what
[02:40:20] did you want me to do what did you want
[02:40:22] me to do with the shangling
[02:40:40] I have four artifact uh domain
[02:40:44] reliquaries
[02:40:46] now as you know
[02:40:51] cake for Traveler
[02:40:52] now as you know we it's tradition around
[02:40:54] here to do a gamble on which set we're
[02:40:56] gonna get more of now it's actually
[02:40:57] matters to see and golden Trooper trip
[02:40:58] was great
[02:41:00] the way you play on child teams hurts
[02:41:01] the watch no it's not you child e then
[02:41:04] you bet it Q then you double swirl with
[02:41:05] cos within your shangling it's not
[02:41:06] [ __ ] hard and then you like enter n3c
[02:41:09] wow it's so hard no the [ __ ] it's not
[02:41:11] okay it's just there's a cryo shield and
[02:41:13] my shiny was on life support and I don't
[02:41:15] care I'm sorry okay if it hurts to watch
[02:41:18] I'm sorry
[02:41:22] with that said we are now going to
[02:41:24] gamble on which side we're gonna get
[02:41:25] more of so feel free to bet your channel
[02:41:27] points on this 50 50.
[02:41:31] which set more
[02:41:35] or Golden Corral
[02:41:39] actually I'll rename them for something
[02:41:40] Massachusetts how do you spell
[02:41:42] Massachusetts
[02:41:44] I don't know we have one minute to vote
[02:41:46] hurry up
[02:41:48] what's that do you want I want both
[02:41:50] doesn't really matter probably for
[02:41:55] probably never let but if not golden
[02:41:57] Troop
[02:41:58] I like for uh official so I'm not for
[02:42:00] either
[02:42:01] did I do the balance yeah we cleaned it
[02:42:03] today it's kind of about that today
[02:42:29] the stream is so delayed no it's not I
[02:42:32] have no delay how do you mean the stream
[02:42:35] is delayed
[02:42:36] that might be on your end
[02:42:45] we found the mobile viewer all right
[02:42:48] ready we have four if it's a tie we will
[02:42:49] open the four star ones for a tiebreaker
[02:42:51] let's go
[02:42:52] okay
[02:42:54] it could be good if it gets good rate
[02:42:55] attack sands on Golden troop that's one
[02:42:57] for doubters two for doubters now
[02:42:59] Believers are in channels will we get
[02:43:01] them out I shall see yes we do it it's
[02:43:03] not one to two a Nemo Goblin could be
[02:43:05] good for chow
[02:43:06] because correct
[02:43:07] lastly
[02:43:10] unfortunately doubters win and it is a
[02:43:12] [ __ ] artifact so I'm sorry Believers we
[02:43:15] have let you down the stream but
[02:43:17] before we redeem the prediction
[02:43:20] I may
[02:43:22] scam
[02:43:25] yes this rules could raid and then it
[02:43:27] only rolls crit to level 20. the odds
[02:43:29] are like one in a hundred but uh if it's
[02:43:32] a one in 100 chance to scan doubters I
[02:43:35] will take it
[02:43:36] nope unlucky
[02:43:38] all right you win this time doubters you
[02:43:40] win this time
[02:43:44] I tried Believers I'm sorry
[02:43:57] ah that sucks but it rolls crit damage
[02:44:00] which means I might as well roll it one
[02:44:02] more time just to see what happens
[02:44:06] just to calm any intrusive or or or or
[02:44:10] any thoughts I may have
[02:44:14] that sucks
[02:44:15] I got a few good pieces off stream
[02:44:17] though I actually been farming this
[02:44:18] domain I've been smart off stream look
[02:44:20] look at this if this gets crit damage
[02:44:22] everyone in chat right now is gonna be
[02:44:24] too stunned to speak You're gonna be
[02:44:25] like socks uh you're right I literally
[02:44:27] cannot think right now
[02:44:31] okay
[02:44:36] look at this one same thing I want you
[02:44:38] guys to pre-type oh my God what an
[02:44:40] amazing piece how did it roll could rate
[02:44:42] I can't believe it
[02:44:44] I mean not bad
[02:44:47] this is actually these are all good
[02:44:49] stats unironically this is actually not
[02:44:50] bad this is actually not bad
[02:44:52] all the stats are good unless it only
[02:44:54] rolls ER it's pretty good
[02:44:59] um
[02:45:01] still good right
[02:45:03] it's actually fine what's the most crit
[02:45:05] damage this could get like
[02:45:12] close to 30 right basically 30. I mean
[02:45:19] foreign
[02:45:27] copium
[02:45:28] if this piece is copium
[02:45:33] then explain the following sequence of
[02:45:36] actions
[02:45:38] explain explain the following sequence
[02:45:42] of actions if this piece is copium
[02:45:47] 21 Point acre damage
[02:45:50] that is interesting if this piece is
[02:45:53] copium how does it look like this
[02:45:55] already
[02:45:57] that is interesting that is interesting
[02:45:59] that is interesting now let's keep
[02:46:02] rolling it and see what happens
[02:46:10] Chad can I throw this or am I waiting
[02:46:12] for Navia I mean I guess no Albedo could
[02:46:16] use this never mind I'll bet I could use
[02:46:17] it
[02:46:20] [ __ ] it
[02:46:26] anyway there's a prime
[02:46:29] foreign
[02:46:42] if this piece is copium
[02:46:45] then why does it have 35 em 5 attack 21
[02:46:49] damage and 9 ER
[02:46:52] all of these stats are useful it's
[02:46:55] decent
[02:46:57] it's pretty decent
[02:46:58] they're all useful you could use it on
[02:47:00] yeah a Miko could use it on fickle you
[02:47:04] could use it on
[02:47:06] yeah it's all right it's not amazing but
[02:47:08] it's okay
[02:47:11] it's actually better than this right
[02:47:15] this is dude this is disgustingly low
[02:47:18] rolls low roll criterade low roll crew
[02:47:20] damage
[02:47:42] 15 attack is better is it even better
[02:47:44] dude
[02:47:45] I guess I'd use this for yai because the
[02:47:48] em and then the ER this is probably a
[02:47:50] eyepiece
[02:47:55] does the top percent matter in my
[02:47:57] [ __ ] four base attack string list
[02:47:58] dude I don't know maybe
[02:48:00] maybe I play Polar Star it's higher
[02:48:08] I guess
[02:48:16] hi I'm fairly neat again I wanted to ask
[02:48:18] is the game eight tier list accurate
[02:48:22] what the [ __ ] is the game eight tier
[02:48:24] list
[02:48:26] eight tears
[02:48:37] what am I gonna click on
[02:48:42] 4.0 tier list and the best characters as
[02:48:45] of September 2023 what is the new player
[02:48:48] seeing when they look this up let's see
[02:48:53] oh my God what the [ __ ] am I looking at
[02:49:00] wait what does the c0 and a C6 tier list
[02:49:06] hey what why does it look like this
[02:49:10] and bad some DPS right in Shogun SS
[02:49:15] support right in Shogun SS
[02:49:24] wait but why is there why is there a c0
[02:49:27] on a C6 one but the c0 one also has c04
[02:49:30] stars
[02:49:31] like I get it but why is it
[02:49:38] okay let's look let's see if it's
[02:49:39] accurate
[02:49:41] DPS
[02:49:43] ayaka who's how right in uh hypham
[02:49:47] wait why is it C1 I'm confused Professor
[02:49:51] why are there arbitrary numbers next to
[02:49:53] them why does that hype them need C1
[02:49:57] why does why does
[02:49:59] ayato needs C2
[02:50:07] I think needs you want or poop no them
[02:50:10] does not need to C1
[02:50:13] um
[02:50:16] what
[02:50:30] c0 to your list
[02:50:34] let's see
[02:50:40] this is hurting my eyes I can't lie
[02:50:50] um
[02:50:55] you wait where's where's nilu
[02:50:59] here's sub DPS
[02:51:01] same here as Albedo
[02:51:05] what am I looking at I mean it's not
[02:51:07] even that bad I guess because Bennett
[02:51:08] it's just the format his ass
[02:51:11] it's like it's not good but it's okay
[02:51:13] but the format is [ __ ] disgusting
[02:51:24] why is ciao a tear under Ito in no world
[02:51:26] is that accurate Shao and Ito were like
[02:51:29] the same level or like considered
[02:51:31] similar before farazan came out before
[02:51:34] far was on then it was gonna be like ah
[02:51:35] he needs powers on before farazan came
[02:51:37] out
[02:51:44] foreign
[02:51:55] main character same tier as sucrose
[02:52:04] yeah venti and Mona are above sucrose
[02:52:07] like they're not even bad it's just
[02:52:09] sucrose is a tear under also baiju
[02:52:20] luck can swing the results of a single
[02:52:23] game
[02:52:27] but they consider cookie sub DPS what
[02:52:30] does that even I guess hyperbloom sure
[02:52:32] but then why is Cookie under
[02:52:37] it's okay it's just
[02:52:42] unpopular opinion whenever you throw
[02:52:43] sucrose butterfly doesn't group as well
[02:52:44] that's not an unpopular opinion
[02:52:45] sucrose's grouping is like trying to eat
[02:52:47] a bowl of cereal without a [ __ ] spoon
[02:52:49] so you're like you're fisting your
[02:52:51] cereal or you're having fistfuls of milk
[02:52:53] and Cheerios or you're drinking it it's
[02:52:55] disgusting but it's like something and
[02:52:58] then that's not even the main part of
[02:52:59] her kit sucrose is broken because
[02:53:01] everything else her grouping is like
[02:53:02] whatever
[02:53:04] like it's okay
[02:53:06] oh this is not I mean it's not okay it's
[02:53:09] bad but it's like it's okay
[02:53:11] it's not out it's not okay
[02:53:14] it's technically okay
[02:53:17] but it's not
[02:53:19] [Music]
[02:53:25] it's bad
[02:53:31] what does the gentian Gigi one look like
[02:53:33] now
[02:53:39] oh my God that is a lot of characters in
[02:53:40] s here
[02:53:48] um
[02:53:53] okay before we talk about before we talk
[02:53:56] about sucrose being BT right before that
[02:53:58] was we meet here
[02:54:00] in what world does everyone keep
[02:54:02] thinking Xiao is like bad I honestly
[02:54:04] don't get it even pretend farzan's not
[02:54:07] out he still has so much AOE that like
[02:54:09] why would you pick all like half of
[02:54:12] these characters over him not not all of
[02:54:13] them obviously like there's some that
[02:54:15] are just better
[02:54:16] than a lot of Denver teams are pretty
[02:54:17] broken but like how his AOE is so good
[02:54:21] and now farazone's out literally how
[02:54:26] when when's the Jeff was testing scarra
[02:54:29] on day one no disrespective scarra but
[02:54:31] with the Java's testing scar on day one
[02:54:33] at a certain point he wanted he was like
[02:54:35] I just want to play Xiao and then went
[02:54:37] to test out again
[02:54:41] in the world
[02:54:46] how is sucrose here how is Beto here
[02:54:50] how's I I mean no I had to be higher I
[02:54:53] think ayatus where's kokomi
[02:54:57] listen I love kokomi kokomi Nation rise
[02:54:59] but how is kokomi two tiers higher
[02:55:05] two
[02:55:13] also sucrose is two tiers under kazua
[02:55:19] um venti's a tier above sucrose I guess
[02:55:22] five star is just better in every tier
[02:55:24] list I've ever seen
[02:55:27] still thought he shouldn't be
[02:55:28] objectively higher than kitchen I'm
[02:55:30] pretty sure they're usually similar in
[02:55:31] strength
[02:55:35] wait what the [ __ ] is this
[02:55:40] okay yo why
[02:55:42] I move this to your list
[02:55:47] wait what
[02:55:51] based on the chillest bite
[02:55:56] okay I'm not getting into CM drama I'm
[02:55:58] not gonna flame I don't know who they
[02:56:00] are all good but what am I looking at
[02:56:09] I mean okay to be like Fair like let's
[02:56:12] say you're a new player it's not like
[02:56:13] the I mean it's pretty bad people it
[02:56:16] like why can you move it
[02:56:21] where did sucrose go
[02:56:35] Kai is in seat here by the way
[02:56:38] I still think Kyle is very underrated
[02:56:40] but fair enough uh yeah Kaya is Daya
[02:56:43] tier according to this
[02:56:46] so is dendro MC so is Barbara
[02:56:50] so is Hazel C6
[02:56:58] Tomah apparently is worse than Daya by a
[02:57:01] whole tier even at C6 where he gives 15
[02:57:03] plunge damage 50 normal and charge
[02:57:06] damage for your wander your Shao
[02:57:08] whatever
[02:57:19] wait okay how are these I don't think
[02:57:22] these Travelers are that bad I mean
[02:57:24] Hydro is Hydra is [ __ ] garbage but
[02:57:29] Miku is the same too
[02:57:31] wait why is Sarah
[02:57:36] I'm gonna say a prayer Sarah is a tear
[02:57:38] higher than Ryden
[02:57:40] yo this has to be a joke Sora is above
[02:57:44] Ryden
[02:57:47] I'm not even the biggest writing simp
[02:57:48] but Sarah's above her
[02:57:52] laughs
[02:57:56] what the [ __ ]
[02:58:02] where's
[02:58:03] wait Fishel isn't even asked here
[02:58:06] I mean I guess
[02:58:08] yeah I don't know
[02:58:13] that's considering C2 for Ryden wait
[02:58:15] where does it say that there's no way
[02:58:17] there's no [ __ ] way there's no way
[02:58:19] this considers C2 Ryden
[02:58:23] she's over it I agree I think Ryden is
[02:58:25] overrated but she's still better than b
[02:58:26] also if this is a tier list that
[02:58:28] probably newer players are gonna look up
[02:58:31] ryden's a lot more Noob friendly than a
[02:58:33] lot of characters like Ryden is more new
[02:58:34] friend like I think International is
[02:58:36] better than rational but rational is
[02:58:38] very forgiving it's like whatever
[02:58:40] happens you just get energy
[02:58:42] also you can play yeah Ryden
[02:58:45] someone said refresh because I moved to
[02:58:46] character I just refreshed what happens
[02:58:51] what does it say it
[02:58:52] oh it shows now yeah that's C2 that is
[02:58:56] CT United that's funny
[02:59:03] um
[02:59:05] yeah
[02:59:09] are you fixing it I don't know if I want
[02:59:12] to but
[02:59:24] well
[02:59:26] Cole to a tier above dendro MC I mean
[02:59:30] Coley's okay
[02:59:32] yao yao is also the same tier
[02:59:35] sucrose is also the same tier
[02:59:52] Albedo is better than sucrose Bado
[02:59:58] Rosaria because I think at this point
[03:00:01] she's better
[03:00:04] that are basically the same unit Xiao
[03:00:07] Ryden
[03:00:15] ayato
[03:00:16] I would also argue that Sino is better
[03:00:18] but I mean I guess if you sign up you
[03:00:22] just replace the kaching because kaching
[03:00:23] could be better I think these are I
[03:00:25] think every five star here is no that's
[03:00:27] not true
[03:00:30] not ordered within the tier yeah but it
[03:00:31] doesn't matter still a tier above
[03:00:34] Sarah is still I don't think Sarah [ __ ]
[03:00:36] it I'm gonna say it I don't think Sarah
[03:00:38] is better than a single character in The
[03:00:40] tier under her except maybe [ __ ] Mika
[03:00:43] but I [ __ ] up the tear this again let
[03:00:44] me go back I don't think Sarah is better
[03:00:46] than ayato I don't think she's better
[03:00:48] than Sino gonyu Ito Gene yeah no still
[03:00:51] no kaching right in Xiao Mia Beto
[03:00:55] maybe Cole but Cole is good in like 15
[03:00:57] second rotation teams so and like nilu
[03:01:00] Bloom so no dial
[03:01:02] yeah download gives you energy Kirara
[03:01:04] and Layla maybe Mika Rosaria sucrose
[03:01:07] Yaya or yunjin
[03:01:18] it's okay though
[03:01:25] but I guess the point like to play
[03:01:27] Devil's Advocate I guess maybe the point
[03:01:30] is like these characters enable these
[03:01:32] elements so they're here
[03:01:36] foreign
[03:01:41] not bad I like quick bloom better but
[03:01:43] not bad nearly Bloom also not bad kokomi
[03:01:46] electrocharge taser not bad right in
[03:01:48] vaporize
[03:01:49] there's a different name for that team
[03:01:51] but not bad
[03:01:54] at least the teams are good
[03:01:56] Ito standard usually has dendro but this
[03:01:58] is a good non-detro team
[03:02:01] standard not bad
[03:02:04] wander standard also not bad however
[03:02:05] Thomas C6 is better than John Lee here
[03:02:07] usually
[03:02:10] Sino aggravate don't play that team play
[03:02:13] quick bloom
[03:02:21] ride in vipe vaporize yeah right into
[03:02:24] vaporizing
[03:02:28] the bill doesn't look bad emblem and
[03:02:29] golfing
[03:02:32] ER attack Electro damage attack critic
[03:02:35] or damage
[03:02:36] molten moment
[03:02:41] was this
[03:02:42] the [ __ ] is a storm B dude I haven't
[03:02:44] killed the Thunderbird in so long
[03:02:48] write an overload
[03:02:51] okay this is not right in overload
[03:02:54] it is right in hyper carry okay it's not
[03:02:57] overload you're not trying to overload
[03:02:59] like yeah you might overload yeah sure
[03:03:02] but it's
[03:03:03] if I could disable the overload reaction
[03:03:06] I usually would
[03:03:12] they're not bad I don't think I don't
[03:03:14] think the subset's bad I think their
[03:03:15] Chile sucks but everything else is fine
[03:03:17] I think it's fine
[03:03:19] like the format looks nice I think most
[03:03:21] of the like the build like they look
[03:03:23] fine
[03:03:24] like build the dreams fully incision
[03:03:27] that's fine
[03:03:28] uh they don't show a lot of four stars
[03:03:30] though why do you not see any
[03:03:31] free-to-play option
[03:03:36] check nilu oh no
[03:03:48] I mean
[03:03:57] yeah I mean
[03:04:00] I guess this is before flop came out
[03:04:05] probably let me assume
[03:04:09] that it was before the new two-piece HP
[03:04:22] but yeah heart of depth is kind of kind
[03:04:24] of questionable
[03:04:28] when nilu first came out Nikita wasn't
[03:04:30] out and you could technically formula if
[03:04:32] because yeah her skill doesn't do damage
[03:04:33] off yield but you could e and then swap
[03:04:36] the deadron C and then snapshot the buff
[03:04:38] or you could just go stop stats stack HP
[03:04:41] energy recharge makes no sense
[03:04:44] the team's fine there's more teams than
[03:04:45] just that though I mean is there is
[03:04:58] anyways
[03:05:08] they have hsr2
[03:05:11] yeah but I I'm not I don't wanna I don't
[03:05:13] wanna enter the HSR rabbit hole
[03:05:22] starting the S tier and move on
[03:05:27] guys let's just put every limited five
[03:05:29] star here this looks good
[03:05:35] yeah remember genuine
[03:05:38] bye bye
[03:05:42] yeah oh good it's not that it's fine all
[03:05:45] right
[03:05:56] thank you
[03:06:09] come on you're in the draft videos I got
[03:06:10] [ __ ] up before this tearless ah Sarge
[03:06:14] but also I will say
[03:06:17] a lot of the like random internet
[03:06:20] content was a lot worse back in back in
[03:06:24] the day I mean everything was worse
[03:06:25] which is kind of why I started making
[03:06:28] videos
[03:06:29] because when I first would look up [ __ ]
[03:06:32] it would just be people being like
[03:06:34] just like wailing and being like
[03:06:38] it was just like I don't know I just
[03:06:40] felt like it was just like whale [ __ ]
[03:06:41] all the time
[03:06:44] but like the general amount of advice
[03:06:46] got a lot better now
[03:06:48] and the amount of resources we have is a
[03:06:50] lot a lot better
[03:07:05] like um
[03:07:12] now
[03:07:18] we need more negative reviews I mean I I
[03:07:21] made a negative review of Daya and I
[03:07:23] made a negative review of farazon and I
[03:07:24] think farzan's good but I think the fact
[03:07:26] that her C6 is such a big part of her
[03:07:28] kid is just bad design
[03:07:31] so like I'm not gonna lie if a character
[03:07:33] is bad
[03:07:34] um
[03:07:35] but I still but I also like think every
[03:07:38] character deserves a guide I know
[03:07:39] sometimes I skip a character because I'm
[03:07:40] like
[03:07:41] busier lazy or tired or whatever but
[03:07:44] like
[03:07:45] like for like Dory I was like yeah she
[03:07:47] sucks but here's a guy if you want to
[03:07:49] play her
[03:07:50] same with like
[03:07:52] yeah okay I still didn't make a clue
[03:07:54] guide but
[03:07:55] I'm sorry sorry Cleveland's
[03:08:01] C6 is so ass dude I don't even I don't
[03:08:04] agree dude I disagree specialist
[03:08:06] officials A4 is broken even without the
[03:08:09] C6 we're just her A4 alone is broken
[03:08:12] it's just a lot of Electro
[03:08:19] here
[03:08:31] worthless
[03:08:33] I think Lila's better than tomon
[03:08:36] Wanderer
[03:08:37] um maybe maybe especially if you don't
[03:08:39] have C6 Toma if you have a C6 Toma it
[03:08:41] becomes a lot harder to argue especially
[03:08:42] if you get pyro resonance with Bennett
[03:08:44] it depends what team you're playing but
[03:08:46] in like the hyper carry hyper carry team
[03:08:47] you have power residents with Bennett
[03:08:49] then uh Layla can give you millif
[03:08:53] but C6 farzan also gives email if that's
[03:08:55] kind of why you go Toma over Zhang Lee's
[03:08:57] because you already have Millis with C6
[03:08:58] bars on uh and then what Tomah does is
[03:09:01] Tomah gives you if you have C6 15 damage
[03:09:04] so it's like a lot on top of pie
[03:09:06] resonance
[03:09:07] um and a five weapon
[03:09:09] also because farzan's energy generation
[03:09:13] and then okay if you're pre-c6 then
[03:09:16] milif becomes more needed but because
[03:09:19] your energy gen would be so bad with
[03:09:21] your farzan if you're not C6
[03:09:23] Bennett like low-key wants the Pyro
[03:09:26] particles from Tomah at that point
[03:09:28] because your energy gen is so bad
[03:09:31] but I still think Layla is pretty good
[03:09:32] though
[03:09:35] I'm not against that take
[03:09:46] as far as on Golden troop I actually
[03:09:47] want to try that
[03:09:53] why is he so angry wait do I sound angry
[03:09:55] I'm sorry
[03:09:57] I'm angry
[03:10:07] not you Thomas oh
[03:10:10] huh
[03:10:14] cheers
[03:10:18] actually I'm curious social experiment
[03:10:20] [ __ ] it social experiment time what
[03:10:23] happens if I just Google genshin tier
[03:10:26] list
[03:10:27] okay it's mostly the ones we clicked on
[03:10:30] it's mostly the ones we clicked on WE
[03:10:31] clicked on this one we clicked on this
[03:10:32] one game Aid was disgusting for my eyes
[03:10:34] like layout wise Focus genshin lab
[03:10:39] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:10:44] 1.0 tier list venti deluke Fishel chichi
[03:10:52] that is a lot of characters in SD hey
[03:10:54] show us
[03:10:57] all I needed to hear all I needed to
[03:10:59] hear hey hey all I needed to hear
[03:11:02] [Laughter]
[03:11:08] is not bad
[03:11:10] Kai is not bad
[03:11:19] he's not good energy decent damage
[03:11:22] especially for reverse mouth also also
[03:11:25] uh uh in dendro people don't know but he
[03:11:28] gives you more blooms like
[03:11:30] people don't know this about dendro a
[03:11:32] lot because dendron cryo isn't really a
[03:11:34] reaction but if you cryo dendro together
[03:11:37] it like you can leave the or you can
[03:11:39] leave them both you can leave underline
[03:11:41] okay you can have underlying detron you
[03:11:42] can apply crime to it and then both of
[03:11:44] them coexist and then you get more
[03:11:45] blooms per hydro and it prevents you
[03:11:47] from burning by accident and like a
[03:11:48] virgin team and basically you just get
[03:11:50] more blooms so it actually does
[03:11:51] something
[03:11:54] it's hard to explain but basically you
[03:11:55] just get more
[03:12:01] let's look at version 1.6
[03:12:07] wow there are so few characters
[03:12:26] how is Beto worse than a razor I don't
[03:12:28] know it's
[03:12:29] sexism
[03:12:31] unfortunate
[03:12:36] chaos may be good but I'm not using a
[03:12:38] 1.04 star
[03:12:40] okay don't use Fishel Bennett Singh Cho
[03:12:44] or sucrose
[03:12:47] how fun
[03:12:50] or Shang Ling
[03:12:57] ER
[03:13:02] Lament
[03:13:19] are you done lying to your viewers
[03:13:20] saying sucrose's saster yeah I'm just
[03:13:23] lying actually
[03:13:24] I'm doing this on purpose so that people
[03:13:27] um
[03:13:27] purpose that people Skip kazua and then
[03:13:29] the game is harder for them and then I
[03:13:31] get more views that's why
[03:13:33] because I want people to like not uh I
[03:13:34] want people to think sucrose is good
[03:13:36] when she's terrible
[03:13:39] that's why you got me
[03:13:42] it's an elaborate plan
[03:13:44] sucrose propaganda
[03:13:48] 53 minutes
[03:14:11] thank you
[03:14:15] the thing with sucrose though is um she
[03:14:18] ends up being worse in practice than in
[03:14:20] theory for like 99 of players not
[03:14:23] everyone like obviously like
[03:14:26] the T season chat you guys know the [ __ ]
[03:14:28] to play sucrose but in practice she ends
[03:14:30] up feeling worse because Caswell nachos
[03:14:32] can group better but can group every
[03:14:34] like six seconds like he can group a lot
[03:14:35] faster like anytime you need to you can
[03:14:37] just swap do it swap do it so I'll do it
[03:14:39] whatever
[03:14:40] and like his skill cooldown's a lot
[03:14:41] shorter
[03:14:42] but also it's like
[03:14:45] it doesn't even matter like
[03:14:47] even if she does feel bad to play
[03:14:51] doesn't change the fact that like the
[03:14:54] amount of damage bonus you're gaining is
[03:14:55] sometimes even higher and you can drive
[03:14:58] a team and you're just a broken amount
[03:15:01] of stats you're gaining that's all just
[03:15:03] it is what it is
[03:15:06] but also like the elements that make her
[03:15:09] feel a bit worse
[03:15:11] like her grouping also end up being like
[03:15:15] translate to slower clears in certain
[03:15:18] content where you need to group or
[03:15:20] there's multi waves or you need to like
[03:15:22] be displacing and it just helps
[03:15:26] but you can also just
[03:15:29] you also can't on field your kazua and a
[03:15:32] lot of times if you're playing taser
[03:15:33] it's just so much better to on-field
[03:15:35] sucrose than like any other character in
[03:15:37] the game because you can double swirl
[03:15:38] all the time
[03:15:41] and you can um hakushin ring
[03:15:50] here
[03:15:55] and it's also a free to play alternative
[03:15:57] and it's also usually what one in each
[03:15:59] team anyways so I don't really
[03:16:00] understand
[03:16:02] the dislike towards her other than just
[03:16:05] I don't like her grouping which I mean I
[03:16:07] don't either but like
[03:16:15] a round of applause
[03:16:30] no
[03:16:31] that's what I meant
[03:16:41] now disappear
[03:16:50] let's light it up over here it's just
[03:16:52] also on so okay here's the thing I think
[03:16:57] because
[03:16:59] the grouping of Kaza also translates to
[03:17:02] better clears and more consistent clears
[03:17:04] it's unfair to ignore it what like even
[03:17:07] if you're just talking about his damage
[03:17:08] because it's like it it translates into
[03:17:10] more damage usually but it's also unfair
[03:17:13] to like
[03:17:15] ignore how much [ __ ] damage and like
[03:17:18] driver potential sucrose gives you just
[03:17:20] because she feels a bit clunky and
[03:17:22] especially because she's a four star
[03:17:24] so like if you can save money on a
[03:17:26] gotcha game you might as well like not
[03:17:28] you might as well but like you should
[03:17:30] know so like
[03:17:32] yeah it doesn't matter what your
[03:17:34] personal like
[03:17:37] oh you're not your but it doesn't matter
[03:17:38] what my personal like
[03:17:40] have fun gameplay is
[03:17:44] for one character
[03:17:46] if the amount of damage you get is like
[03:17:49] really high
[03:17:51] stabilize
[03:17:55] them
[03:17:59] I'm still on the level one heart
[03:18:06] I'm going in
[03:18:08] came to see that you're down for not
[03:18:09] claiming Belfast dude well I literally
[03:18:12] claimed it
[03:18:19] let's Light It Up
[03:18:23] how's those game changing yeah
[03:18:24] absolutely
[03:18:26] Casa is probably the most valuable five
[03:18:28] star alongside uh Nikita
[03:18:36] but that doesn't mean that sucrose isn't
[03:18:37] also good you know they're just like
[03:18:38] different
[03:18:45] and voila
[03:18:51] causes better in every way okay but see
[03:18:53] now you're a dumbass like there's a
[03:18:55] difference between having an opinion and
[03:18:57] just being wrong because like
[03:18:59] anytime you want to be on field
[03:19:01] causewood is just garbage compared to
[03:19:02] sucrose it's not even close like you
[03:19:04] can't drive on kazua and then for Google
[03:19:07] swirl Supergirls is better and then for
[03:19:09] certain Electro teams damage wise
[03:19:12] sucrose is better when you can use
[03:19:14] hakush and ring and taser sucrose is
[03:19:16] better than for every other situation
[03:19:17] causes better
[03:19:19] so like a lot of times well not every
[03:19:21] other Century but a lot of times I'd
[03:19:23] rather have causa if I could only use
[03:19:25] one in a lot of teams Cosmo feels nicer
[03:19:28] like
[03:19:30] objectively there's just teams where
[03:19:32] sucrose is just better or
[03:19:34] it's not too gross no my Whip It Up
[03:19:40] solidify
[03:19:49] and like it's dangerous so I also think
[03:19:52] Kazo is better in Pro like better in
[03:19:55] practice than like in theory because
[03:19:56] also the grouping very often because
[03:19:59] your cooldown's low adds up to a lot so
[03:20:01] I love Cosmo I think he's [ __ ] sick
[03:20:03] and I think everyone that can filter him
[03:20:04] should pull from over here however it is
[03:20:06] very dangerous and misleading in a
[03:20:08] gotcha game if [ __ ] come in a
[03:20:11] chat where I'm trying to at least give
[03:20:13] good advice because I make guides and be
[03:20:14] like yeah this four-star character that
[03:20:17] replaces a five star that you would pull
[03:20:18] for is useless it's like no I can't say
[03:20:20] that because it's not true
[03:20:22] and she's also objectively better than
[03:20:24] any other character in certain teams you
[03:20:26] need to know that
[03:20:27] because if you care about that stuff
[03:20:29] then you want to have the option
[03:20:31] man I'm waiting like
[03:20:34] no it's not worth it no I'm not
[03:20:46] dude I was thinking about it okay I was
[03:20:48] thinking about this also
[03:20:50] you know how c62 girls like infuses or
[03:20:52] something and like when you use it and
[03:20:54] you're playing like pyro it decides to
[03:20:55] infuse with the wind or like the water
[03:20:57] and then it's Hydro randomly okay I was
[03:20:59] thinking like yo you know how like
[03:21:01] you're playing a mono Electro team right
[03:21:03] you're playing [ __ ] oh this could be
[03:21:04] good you're playing this actually is
[03:21:05] insane you're playing like like
[03:21:06] aggravate okay then you're only
[03:21:08] swirlable element is Electro so there's
[03:21:10] no way it doesn't swell Electro that's
[03:21:12] what I was thinking then I played it a
[03:21:13] bit and then sometimes it just wouldn't
[03:21:15] Infuse anything
[03:21:18] so
[03:21:20] aware I guess
[03:21:23] all right let's all this
[03:21:37] foreign
[03:21:51] who would argue that sucrose's bad will
[03:21:54] not be good enough at the game to
[03:21:55] perform better with sucrose at least in
[03:21:58] National okay that is a good take but
[03:22:01] yeah I mean I guess
[03:22:03] I guess that is the seller if you I
[03:22:05] guess that is a good self-report
[03:22:27] oh
[03:22:33] we just got we just got defense percent
[03:22:39] Paige chatter wait what did I miss did I
[03:22:41] miss a compliment I'm not gonna miss
[03:22:42] reading that
[03:22:45] where was the page chatter such a tall
[03:22:46] and handsome man hey Drew
[03:22:50] foreign
[03:22:57] thanks for all the guys have been super
[03:22:59] helpful
[03:23:00] true
[03:23:01] I mean you're welcome
[03:23:14] I just got on
[03:23:29] oh not again please not again please I
[03:23:34] have like five feathers that only rolled
[03:23:36] the m please Em's not even bad okay Em's
[03:23:40] good but I already have like five just
[03:23:43] not another
[03:23:44] just not another I would rather have
[03:23:46] defense percent I said it I said it I'm
[03:23:48] sorry I have too many em pieces
[03:23:52] okay good
[03:23:54] good not the highest roll but it is what
[03:23:56] it is
[03:23:58] pretty sure that was 5.4 but it is what
[03:23:59] it is
[03:24:05] please just not em not em
[03:24:10] okay another low Roll Another low roll
[03:24:13] but it's good this is so far so good one
[03:24:17] more crit roll and we're happy
[03:24:24] Chad is the 5.4 roll actually 5.45
[03:24:28] because when you roll it twice it's
[03:24:30] first one's 4.4 seconds 0.5
[03:24:47] .49 oh yeah it could be something like
[03:24:50] that
[03:24:51] all right last roll shows we've got a
[03:24:53] high roll cut right anything but em

[03:26:19] and voila all right after this
[03:26:26] let's get this show on the road
[03:26:40] well I have no resin no I can refresh
[03:26:42] this one
[03:26:44] foreign
[03:26:49] chatter
[03:26:56] why do you guys keep okay okay listen
[03:26:58] you need to ask better questions
[03:27:00] someone's like what bow should I use on
[03:27:02] child to give polar start official I
[03:27:04] don't know what you have I don't know
[03:27:06] what other bows you have if you have
[03:27:07] like a stringless R5 then you should get
[03:27:09] that official and keep polar on child
[03:27:10] but it depends what yeah
[03:27:16] where's the bus to do with Fang yeah
[03:27:18] that one's edited but not out yet I need
[03:27:20] to upload it this week surely
[03:27:23] I have two two that are edited one I
[03:27:25] don't want to release because I meow but
[03:27:28] the other one I'm gonna upload
[03:27:40] okay we have to do our weeklies afap
[03:27:47] team uh okay if you're like free to play
[03:27:51] you can low-key use okay well ideally
[03:27:53] because your dendro doesn't have to be
[03:27:56] fast you don't have to use the heat on
[03:27:57] that team you use it on others you use
[03:27:59] like yayao or Kirara or you could use
[03:28:01] nahida there if you have her and then
[03:28:02] use like Zhang Li zhangi is not
[03:28:04] technically a Healer but he's a shielder
[03:28:06] you can use heart of a harbinger of dawn
[03:28:08] um as well
[03:28:10] if you have wrongly so wrongly works
[03:28:12] well you could also use baiju you could
[03:28:15] also use
[03:28:17] um if you're free to play you use
[03:28:18] Barbara or kokomi if you're you have

[03:40:16] is from Polar Star what is this
[03:40:19] also no criterate
[03:40:21] child
[03:40:22] okay I used to have a game where we
[03:40:25] every time we saw a child who would
[03:40:26] guess if they have 60 credit or more I'm
[03:40:28] guessing this one's gonna have 62. okay
[03:40:31] never mind

[03:40:51] wait what is that app
[03:40:57] that was with a crittering weapon that
[03:41:00] was with a crit rate weapon
[03:41:02] how do you have a critterade weapon and
[03:41:05] have 40 crittery
[03:41:22] Ito is worse
[03:41:30] okay but I so surely at this point you
[03:41:33] just go for a criterate circle it
[03:41:34] doesn't even matter what the sub stats
[03:41:36] are
[03:41:42] foreign
[03:41:47] wait a second crit damage

[03:41:53] oh these are healers crit damage
[03:41:57] crit damage crit damage crit damage at
[03:42:01] this point it's a conscious effort it's
[03:42:03] not like oh my artifacts are bad it's
[03:42:05] like you're actively choosing to just go
[03:42:07] crit damage on everyone

[03:43:33] carry
[03:43:38] think about it I mean okay I agree I
[03:43:41] think criterate is for losers because
[03:43:42] who cares if you can crit consistently
[03:43:45] if you can't crit a big number I would
[03:43:47] rather crit a big number once a year
[03:43:49] than a small number every day
[03:43:55] however
[03:43:59] still want more than I
[03:44:03] did he had a crit rate weapon and still
[03:44:06] had like 40 crit rate that doesn't make
[03:44:09] sense

[03:49:57] it's like I'm dying
[03:50:08] okay
[03:50:11] I have a problem where I don't even
[03:50:13] level my characters enough but I want to
[03:50:15] do a thing where like for a month or
[03:50:16] something like for a month we spend our
[03:50:19] resin just leveling characters because I
[03:50:21] want to get everyone to 90.
[03:50:24] eventually
[03:50:25] but I feel like it's never gonna happen
[03:50:26] navigating the world
[03:50:28] easier with a few
[03:50:32] [Music]
[03:50:41] different
[03:50:44] I want a 90 Eloy

[03:51:18] it dude Lane didn't say anything no they
[03:51:20] said hello
[03:51:21] and they're they're the thing is happy I
[03:51:23] can't they're literally two look scenery
[03:51:26] is wonderful they're happy I can't do it
[03:51:28] enough to convince anyone to become a
[03:51:30] Wanderer if it was this guy hey if it
[03:51:32] was this guy's world if it was this the
[03:51:34] alarm's world every crystal fly would be
[03:51:37] mine they'd be [ __ ] god there would
[03:51:39] be a genocide that that species would be
[03:51:41] extinct
[03:51:51] navigating the world is a whole lot
[03:51:53] easier with a few different identities
[03:51:54] to choose from need me to come up with
[03:51:57] some for you
[03:52:04] okay I'm sorry
[03:52:08] well Ty for run might as well leave
[03:52:11] gotta go uh spenerism
[03:52:14] how many handles not activating five
[03:52:16] star cons I just don't notice them
[03:52:22] I don't I've never noticed exclamation
[03:52:24] marks and games ever
[03:52:25] I've just always been too like
[03:52:28] I don't know I never really I've always
[03:52:31] had a lot of notifications on [ __ ]
[03:52:33] because I don't clear them so I just got
[03:52:35] used to it
[03:52:36] like my phone has like red bubble over
[03:52:39] every app I don't really care
[03:52:41] did it's too much time to go over it
[03:52:49] five out of six how is that even how is
[03:52:52] that even related
[03:52:53] foreign
[03:52:56] have it why not because I don't because
[03:52:58] you can't disable it
[03:53:00] I've explained this a lot it's just like
[03:53:01] it's not worth like for a lot of five
[03:53:03] stars it's like
[03:53:05] you don't want people to think that care
[03:53:06] I don't want to not be able to showcase
[03:53:08] the character at c0 or like C1
[03:53:11] anymore basically
[03:53:14] with shallow it's fine because the C6 is
[03:53:15] nothing if you don't like E when after
[03:53:18] you plunge but like
[03:53:20] I don't want
[03:53:23] a good character to only look good
[03:53:26] because they're C6 type of thing
[03:53:34] I have to get rid of every no to
[03:53:35] everything of every single notification
[03:53:37] to ever exists I feel like most people
[03:53:38] are like that but I'm not I don't really
[03:53:40] know I don't I literally don't notice
[03:53:43] exclamation marks like to me the
[03:53:44] exclamation mark is just there it
[03:53:45] doesn't mean why'd I just [ __ ] windy
[03:53:47] plant it doesn't mean like I have to
[03:53:49] click on it here comes

[04:07:50] this
[04:08:04] whoa new character
[04:08:08] let me see how he plays
[04:08:12] yeah there's some good Hider damage
[04:08:25] like a hydro carry
[04:08:31] yeah yeah

[04:08:46] 43 seconds oh 44 I guess
[04:09:04] 45 I can't I can't that is optimal child
[04:09:07] gameplay
[04:09:12] oh I have a pool
[04:09:14] [ __ ]
[04:09:23] gambo remember when I wasted 160 Primos
[04:09:26] on this for no reason
[04:09:28] oh four star
[04:09:30] it's going good something new
[04:09:36] on that note chat
[04:09:39] I'm sick I need to rest I've been live
[04:09:41] for four hours the next stream will be
[04:09:43] nebula's release I think I'm gonna do
[04:09:44] viewer pulls shangling is a good frame
[04:09:46] to end on because we got shangling never
[04:09:48] let is going to come out right tomorrow
[04:09:50] Tuesday I'm going to do viewer polls for
[04:09:52] 10 people if you already have the
[04:09:54] previous look I'm not gonna like because
[04:09:55] you I'm not gonna be like the doing
[04:09:57] giveaways for new character but we're
[04:09:59] gonna do some viewer spells because I
[04:10:00] think we're challenging another streamer
[04:10:02] and then right after that we're gonna do
[04:10:04] uh never that testing and gameplay and
[04:10:06] all that the only problem is I think
[04:10:09] he's gonna need a lot of [ __ ]
[04:10:11] from 4.1 probably now you might be like
[04:10:13] how you know this listen we know this
[04:10:17] um
[04:10:18] so
[04:10:20] I don't know how long it's gonna take
[04:10:21] for me to like level him
[04:10:24] but when I do I do
[04:10:26] uh with that in mind
[04:10:28] yeah they announced it
[04:10:30] I just don't know where that's why I
[04:10:31] don't know but yeah
[04:10:33] um with that in mind
[04:10:35] and if they didn't then it doesn't
[04:10:37] matter because why there's no Hydro boss
[04:10:39] in the game right now so there you go
[04:10:41] anyways uh I don't know how long it's
[04:10:43] gonna take but we'll do that day one
