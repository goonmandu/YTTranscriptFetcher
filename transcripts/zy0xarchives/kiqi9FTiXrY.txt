[00:08:19] am not touching the [ __ ] Fontana
[00:08:21] archon Quest
[00:08:25] soon surely
[00:08:28] not a scammer Shirley
[00:08:30] anyways welcome to the stream I have a
[00:08:32] special thing to say first when we start
[00:08:34] hello
[00:08:37] my brother's here until tomorrow
[00:08:39] he is currently awake in the room behind
[00:08:40] me and my father is also awake so I have
[00:08:42] to be responsible and quiet today also
[00:08:47] it is the Genji impact font into our
[00:08:49] exclamation mark gentian hashtag ad so
[00:08:52] there is no reason for me to be loud
[00:08:53] with that in mind
[00:09:00] yo
[00:09:01] welcome to the stream we have a lot to
[00:09:03] do I was thinking about it before I
[00:09:04] started we actually have a lot to do so
[00:09:06] I okay I've been playing mini a lot but
[00:09:09] I haven't played uh I haven't gotten to
[00:09:12] do pretty much anything hey Mr chosen
[00:09:14] baguette I don't see the Mage off stream
[00:09:16] that I wanted to do on stream so we're
[00:09:18] like ready what is that weapon Harvest
[00:09:20] fine grow up
[00:09:23] do you want me to pull [ __ ] you how are
[00:09:25] your talents looking okay I thought I
[00:09:27] was gonna pre-farm the talents like more
[00:09:28] off stream I said [ __ ] it I'm still
[00:09:30] 8-1-1 here's what we're gonna do we're
[00:09:32] gonna fart for Lynette's talents today
[00:09:33] and then we'll transmutation them and
[00:09:36] then we'll get Lindy tolerance through
[00:09:37] Lynette but it doesn't matter because I
[00:09:39] already have the whole Lenny guide
[00:09:41] recorded it's being edited right now
[00:09:43] it'll be uploaded right after the Stream
[00:09:45] so Lindy guide will be out and then we
[00:09:46] just have to play Lynette test her out
[00:09:48] the night guide will come out after uh
[00:09:49] and then official
[00:09:51] so that's the plan
[00:09:52] happy belated why are you using their
[00:09:54] ideas on iron equivocally good on a
[00:09:57] little
[00:09:59] also chat okay as a viewer I need to
[00:10:01] know but okay I actually need to know
[00:10:03] this so I know I know people are like oh
[00:10:05] more info is better okay I know but
[00:10:07] listen
[00:10:08] we're like Lenny's team section
[00:10:10] shouldn't be long it's just play mono
[00:10:12] pyro that's it have fun that's it two or
[00:10:15] three pyros jean-li or kazua or
[00:10:17] shangling that's it have fun but
[00:10:19] I went into a bit more detail on like
[00:10:22] which supports are good with him and I
[00:10:24] gotta talk about all of them so I don't
[00:10:25] know if I should trim it because it's
[00:10:27] kind of a bit long like it's not like a
[00:10:29] really long but it's like I feel like I
[00:10:31] could save like four minutes
[00:10:33] but I also feel like people kind of want
[00:10:36] to know and people want to know if they
[00:10:37] can play Lynette with him and people
[00:10:38] want to know if day is good and like she
[00:10:40] is but also she's annoying so I kind of
[00:10:42] want to explain it and then Petro Jeong
[00:10:43] these not is like pretty cracked and
[00:10:45] then so
[00:10:46] I mean I I keep it but it's like I don't
[00:10:49] want the video to be like [ __ ] like
[00:10:51] almost pushing 30 so we'll see I don't

[00:24:45] um
[00:24:46] dude there's a lot of characters that
[00:24:48] [ __ ] heal I don't know what element
[00:24:49] uh
[00:24:52] uh I mean
[00:24:57] could make sense on cookie I'm pretty
[00:24:58] sure kooky has something
[00:25:03] how does he do it honestly I don't know
[00:25:06] how he does it I don't know how he does
[00:25:08] it
[00:25:08] he's just different cheated I literally
[00:25:11] checked if my guesses were bad that
[00:25:13] doesn't even matter
[00:25:14] that's after I already guessed them
[00:25:16] how's that cheating I chat closed
[00:25:21] I'm too good
[00:25:23] it's the EM passive
[00:25:26] probably
[00:25:30] no it's not this is the one
[00:25:33] so uh chatter you were wrong
[00:25:39] Chad how many of you
[00:25:42] if you get burst game's normal attack or
[00:25:44] uh where is it
[00:25:46] no not even wait no that's in the burst
[00:25:48] description how many of you remember
[00:25:49] that when he is not on the field and his
[00:25:51] energy is less than 40 he will
[00:25:52] regenerate two energy for himself every
[00:25:54] second
[00:25:56] yeah there's no way you remember that
[00:25:58] there's no way you knew that ayato
[00:26:00] gained a bit of energy from all field
[00:26:03] there's no way
[00:26:07] me I watched your guide okay true but I
[00:26:11] don't remember I I swear it's like
[00:26:13] I forget half the [ __ ] after I like

[00:26:17] out
[00:26:31] you're terrible um
[00:26:35] okay I will say this confidently there
[00:26:38] is not an ayato in the chat who has a
[00:26:40] better who has a better ratio than mine
[00:26:41] there's not one there's not a hurricane
[00:26:44] on set Echoes with attack percent and er
[00:26:46] factored in there's not one sorry I said
[00:26:48] it there's not one there's maybe one in
[00:26:50] the world he's not in chat right now
[00:27:01] yo takes all the songs in a second I'm

[00:27:37] Fontaine is like an elemental skill
[00:27:38] region like you know it's like a
[00:27:40] Elemental burst region I think fontan's
[00:27:42] like a skill region I'm not even coping
[00:27:44] I'm not even coping I think like dude
[00:27:47] Farina comes out [ __ ]
[00:27:49] [ __ ] Navia [ __ ] clorindy
[00:27:52] you'll see
[00:28:06] what is nylon gonna be now let's gonna
[00:28:08] have a new set that is uh three to four
[00:28:11] percent better than uh Vermillion on
[00:28:13] Charles that we have yet another set to
[00:28:15] farm for I actually can't wait I can't
[00:28:18] wait for that we're gonna get a three
[00:28:20] percent DPS increase in not land as
[00:28:22] shamans we will yep it's gonna be great
[00:28:25] I cannot wait for that
[00:28:29] wait do I have VV on my Lynette what are
[00:28:30] the odds John how many gifted if I if I
[00:28:32] have her geared how many gifted would

[00:29:09] like I'm free to play starting today
[00:29:11] okay we're about to just like not very
[00:29:13] free to play but like today I'm free to
[00:29:15] play I haven't spent money today so
[00:29:17] technically from now on we're free to
[00:29:19] play
[00:29:21] okay but to be fair I wasted okay all of
[00:29:24] my resin like disappeared that wasn't my
[00:29:25] fault
[00:29:27] [ __ ] I should okay maybe next stream
[00:29:29] will have like a thousand resin no we
[00:29:32] won't we'll have like 160 but
[00:29:34] I have no mappings
[00:29:45] foreign
[00:29:48] I think there's one more flower spot we
[00:29:50] wanted to go to
[00:29:54] maybe I got most of them can I send my
[00:29:56] Lynette
[00:29:58] nice
[00:30:01] yo how's everything for seven months
[00:30:03] I'll go through the other subs I missed
[00:30:04] in a second uh but I do need 20 more
[00:30:06] flowers because I want to get her at
[00:30:08] least ascended like we can use her once
[00:30:10] she gets this
[00:30:12] so um yep
[00:30:21] foreign
[00:30:28] I have four constellations I could
[00:30:30] actually go for C6 I kind of want to try
[00:30:33] this
[00:30:35] no books skull emoji [ __ ] actually you
[00:30:38] didn't even touch the correct spelling
[00:30:39] what did you did skull and crossbones
[00:30:42] foreign
[00:30:59] okay what should we do Chad should we
[00:31:00] actually do the should we do okay okay
[00:31:02] we'll be honest should I do the talent
[00:31:03] books for Lynette or should I do gilded
[00:31:06] golden dreams troop gilded
[00:31:09] I kind of did the new artifact but I
[00:31:12] should probably do talents yeah okay
[00:31:14] I'll be responsible
[00:31:20] remember when I did the wrong talents
[00:31:22] yesterday I remember but I should
[00:31:24] probably wait do I have some for that I
[00:31:25] might already have some I just don't
[00:31:27] have some for Lenny
[00:31:29] okay no I don't
[00:31:31] oh that's so funny that's so funny wait
[00:31:34] which one does she need she needs order
[00:31:36] orders today right order today
[00:31:38] [Music]
[00:31:46] all right well bench on that for a
[00:31:48] second
[00:31:49] Lenny's cracked I honestly think Vinny's
[00:31:51] cracked I also think he feels a lot
[00:31:52] better than your average charge attacker
[00:31:54] because his skill and burst aren't dog
[00:31:57] [ __ ] in comparison with literally every
[00:31:58] other charge hacking character oh what
[00:32:00] about on you yeah ratio unless you're
[00:32:02] playing venti and then on top of that he
[00:32:04] like I don't know I feel like and you
[00:32:06] don't have to double swirl and he's just
[00:32:07] like I don't know I think he's a lot
[00:32:09] more fun
[00:32:10] we only have two yeah but I mean it's
[00:32:13] just true
[00:32:15] okay I do think Big T is kind of fun too
[00:32:18] because at least you can like quick
[00:32:20] scope three times
[00:32:22] which is which is not bad
[00:32:32] um dude what the [ __ ] is this domain by
[00:32:34] the way before I even dude before I can
[00:32:35] even use my Lindy they're dead
[00:32:38] foreign
[00:32:40] never mind
[00:32:44] usual I'll take okay but
[00:32:47] okay the thing with Linny
[00:32:49] if you haven't played them is like so on
[00:32:51] paper his Char trots are like pretty
[00:32:53] [ __ ] high DPS right but they're very
[00:32:55] single Target which is like it's fine
[00:32:56] but
[00:32:59] I was like I know like yoy Mia players
[00:33:01] will like cope and be like oh actually
[00:33:03] this your Mia streamer I watched says
[00:33:05] that yoemiya is AOE because Bennett
[00:33:07] kozua okay listen Linda you can still do
[00:33:10] that Lenny also does mana Causeway but
[00:33:12] he can actually feel AOE because because
[00:33:14] in content where it is AOE you can just
[00:33:16] play a more quick swappy like you can do
[00:33:17] a chart shop and then you can do an E
[00:33:18] and a burst which are qjos and then you
[00:33:21] swap out use your cos I use your
[00:33:22] whatever the [ __ ] and then you can just
[00:33:23] like charge out a little
[00:33:26] oh yeah now our skill and bursts are
[00:33:27] level one don't judge our damage I yeah
[00:33:30] I listen listen shut up shut up
[00:33:43] I look back to the first time I join fun
[00:33:47] amazing
[00:33:49] Community thank you for having me to
[00:33:52] some extent a wholesome Community yeah
[00:33:54] what what did the other half of the
[00:33:56] community do to you jeez
[00:33:58] let me go to one tonight right after
[00:34:00] stream probably like a bit after it it's
[00:34:02] all it's basically done
[00:34:06] it's causal snapshot his verse does but
[00:34:08] you can still use this burst before like
[00:34:10] it it matters if you're like a crit
[00:34:12] cause well but if you're just pulled
[00:34:13] yeah I'm like it's not the biggest deal
[00:34:14] so you can if you want to like if you're
[00:34:16] you wanna have like more Bennett up time
[00:34:18] or something you can use Kazo first the
[00:34:20] only problem and like just burst outside
[00:34:22] of Bennett's burst the only problem is
[00:34:24] that Verdes inventor only lasts 10
[00:34:25] seconds then it's all last 12. so it's
[00:34:28] like yeah
[00:34:31] what is snapshotting okay imagine you're
[00:34:33] at McDonald's right okay imagine you're
[00:34:35] at McDonald's I I've told the story
[00:34:37] before let me let me this is the classic
[00:34:38] snapshotting uh dilemma let's say you're
[00:34:40] at McDonald's and you order breakfast
[00:34:42] at 10 59 a.m and they stop serving
[00:34:45] breakfast at 11. okay let's say by the
[00:34:48] time the cook is making the breakfast it
[00:34:50] is 1105 before he's done do you think at
[00:34:53] 11 if at 11 A.M sharp he says no [ __ ]
[00:34:57] you go somewhere else we're not making
[00:34:58] you breakfast have a Big Mac or shut up
[00:35:00] then it did not snap your order did not
[00:35:03] snapshot but if at 11 and 1101 and 1102
[00:35:06] says hey I'm still gonna make this good
[00:35:08] man or woman uh their their burger their
[00:35:11] breakfast from for whatever they ordered
[00:35:13] then it snapshotted the order at 10.59
[00:35:16] and you still managed to uh get the buff
[00:35:18] of it being breakfast time
[00:35:20] that is what snapshotting is but apply
[00:35:23] to gentian so for example use Bennett
[00:35:26] burst and then Bennett burst is about to
[00:35:28] expire you Shang Ling pyronado nice
[00:35:30] City and then Bennett's burst expires
[00:35:33] most of the community is Pepe going but
[00:35:34] your pyreneos
[00:35:36] some grass and talk to people and other
[00:35:39] half is white people happy
[00:35:42] yeah it's like it's come off honestly
[00:35:45] it's like that okay not to like
[00:35:48] like that is an unfortunate reality and
[00:35:50] it's like it's like that basically
[00:35:51] everywhere it's pretty sad
[00:35:54] most communities are like half it's
[00:35:56] super wholesome and great and the other
[00:35:58] half is aware
[00:36:09] I don't think it's half half though I
[00:36:11] think it's like 95.5 but I know the
[00:36:13] guide is coming out tonight but there's
[00:36:15] a sneak peek how good does Lenny's
[00:36:17] rotations feel to you I pulled him for
[00:36:20] design but I have no idea how he plays
[00:36:22] or how good he he definitely feels good
[00:36:24] like I am depressed when I play a
[00:36:26] character and you can tell on day one
[00:36:29] when I'm not having fun okay
[00:36:31] I love one I like wander but the old the
[00:36:34] first Abyss with Cesaro farzan and no
[00:36:36] shield made me want to made me want to
[00:36:38] eat my monitor like like eat it
[00:36:42] but Lenny doesn't do that to me and this
[00:36:43] Abyss is probably his like gonna like
[00:36:45] this Abyss is terrible for him but he
[00:36:46] still feels pretty good like I actually
[00:36:48] like living in streams
[00:36:53] definitely a paid don't know
[00:36:55] I appreciate it
[00:36:59] imagine dude I could one shot these guys
[00:37:00] with just my burst and E if I had the
[00:37:02] [ __ ] talents
[00:37:08] no it's not worth to bench your child
[00:37:10] for Linny okay
[00:37:12] but Lenny is still good like if like
[00:37:14] don't pull for an upgrade to the best
[00:37:17] team in the game okay
[00:37:19] but if you want to play Lenny you can
[00:37:22] use him in that team yes
[00:37:31] uh let me go see if I can craft some
[00:37:34] Talent books with any from yai show me
[00:37:36] your build I can keep in mind that our
[00:37:37] Lenny could be doing outside of Swiss
[00:37:39] Talent his uh skill and burster level
[00:37:41] one but outside of that he could still
[00:37:43] be doing 20 more damage because Madison
[00:37:45] stays like 20 better than Earth that
[00:37:47] we're running right now so
[00:37:49] well I guess it's not really true
[00:37:51] because it gives you crit rate so
[00:37:52] whatever but you get my point okay
[00:37:56] um
[00:37:58] what do I want to make oh yeah a talent
[00:37:59] books
[00:38:09] hello my check oh guide to order okay
[00:38:11] we'll do seven and we'll leave uh
[00:38:13] I mean we should probably leave some
[00:38:15] we'll leave we'll leave six
[00:38:19] rage Equity I thought plenty would
[00:38:22] please the equity 2.0 but if I click on
[00:38:25] this and it's Equity about reactions and
[00:38:27] he heals and does good damage Fields can
[00:38:29] next better
[00:38:41] there is no way yeah I just gave me
[00:38:44] three of the wrong book
[00:38:58] oh
[00:39:00] it's fine
[00:39:02] um
[00:39:04] I need free to play weapon for the knee
[00:39:06] prototype Crescent R5 is a very good
[00:39:08] option
[00:39:09] the new uh craftable bow is fine as well
[00:39:18] a lot of sevens in our uh
[00:39:21] thing
[00:39:23] [ __ ] wait how do I not have any gears
[00:39:28] um well let's uh let's uh let's just
[00:39:31] yeah I'll get it I'll get okay let's not
[00:39:33] talk about it
[00:39:35] foreign
[00:39:39] you can't laugh at me but then get mad
[00:39:41] when I do something about it you laugh
[00:39:43] at me when I don't do anything and then
[00:39:44] when I do something it's like oh Pepe w
[00:39:49] fine I'll give you guys a pull for your
[00:39:51] because you have to witness that this is
[00:39:53] for you chat this pulls for you this has
[00:39:55] your name on it Four Star
[00:40:01] I'm sorry I mean we already have her but
[00:40:04] if we didn't we'd be happy
[00:40:14] um okay well we have to do more now Saj
[00:40:23] it's fine surely surely this time we got
[00:40:24] Equity books
[00:40:38] wait chat
[00:40:41] well actually one sec
[00:40:57] I'll tell you guys in a second
[00:41:00] it's your Lenny build it's not good you
[00:41:03] want four Modesto C that's what you want
[00:41:04] okay but I just have this right now
[00:41:06] because we haven't entered the new
[00:41:07] domain but I mean his ratio is insane
[00:41:09] because it's like yeah my lady like he's
[00:41:11] good but he's not so don't talk about it
[00:41:15] what you can stop 1618
[00:41:31] oh fog
[00:41:35] good dare Edition thanks thanks man I've
[00:41:37] been practicing it I've been practicing
[00:41:39] it
[00:41:52] that felt like 15 seconds if we have all
[00:41:54] our bursts we can probably one shot them
[00:41:56] but our Lenny's versus level one so I
[00:41:58] don't know
[00:42:09] maybe not close enough though
[00:42:15] so fast
[00:42:19] but uh I just don't like using all of my
[00:42:21] resin for this because it's like I would
[00:42:23] I'd rather use the talent books I saved
[00:42:25] for this and then the resin on the new
[00:42:26] domain but it's fine we'll see if we get
[00:42:28] lucky with the thing with the eye
[00:42:32] we could always do just the guild we
[00:42:33] could like grind gilded like next stream
[00:42:35] it's fine I'll do some today but or
[00:42:37] golden I'll go dude
[00:42:41] [Music]
[00:42:54] you
[00:43:00] all right Shirley
[00:43:03] we just want Equity we need two green
[00:43:05] ones that's actually not even hard to
[00:43:06] get last time we got three Justice if we
[00:43:08] got two equity
[00:43:10] actually not even hard to get we're
[00:43:11] happy
[00:43:13] [ __ ] it I'm not keeping ingredients
[00:43:18] dude you
[00:43:22] okay uh there is no way there's like
[00:43:26] this game doesn't want me to level any I
[00:43:28] guess uh
[00:43:30] you
[00:43:35] hook
[00:43:40] they actually don't want me to level
[00:43:42] Lenny I so I I might just use these for
[00:43:45] Lynette because I don't really have the
[00:43:49] dude
[00:43:50] [Music]
[00:43:52] I got five I got more than five but I
[00:43:55] converted three into one because I'm a
[00:43:57] dumbass
[00:43:58] so
[00:43:59] yeah it's fine I have to open chests
[00:44:03] I'm doing this
[00:44:10] [Music]
[00:44:15] why is someone laughing at my A3 Abyss I
[00:44:18] just dude it just reset it's not like
[00:44:21] I'm stuck there
[00:44:32] dude I'll literally do it this stream
[00:44:40] what is this it's kind of weird champ
[00:44:46] give me

[01:11:41] electors the current Abyss is probably
[01:11:43] the worst uh it's like a linear Nerf
[01:11:45] like I'm sure whatever the next of this
[01:11:47] is will be better this could be good on
[01:11:48] Albedo by the way uh Geo on Golden but
[01:11:52] the uh this this is like pretty bad for
[01:11:54] him I cleared it with him but I did um
[01:11:57] well we're gonna clear today
[01:11:59] uh and to clear what we'll do is we'll
[01:12:01] play on either second half and Brute
[01:12:03] Force the PMA or S Simon not PMA
[01:12:06] assignment or we put him first and we
[01:12:08] run a hydro support you don't really
[01:12:09] want to hydro support with them but this
[01:12:11] you kind of don't really have a choice
[01:12:14] you can also make
[01:12:15] kazua and then like Layla and have a bit
[01:12:17] of cryo it might work I didn't try that
[01:12:29] first
[01:12:33] another Hawaii
[01:12:36] wait it's show time and then they just
[01:12:39] died oh yeah I gotta do that's actually
[01:12:41] okay
[01:12:42] I like mini
[01:12:44] I like that this Japanese voice uh as
[01:12:46] Japanese west side it's still it's real
[01:12:47] time
[01:12:49] this could be good actually no it can't
[01:12:52] you want crit damage not crit rate I'm
[01:12:54] not actually we're still gonna lock it
[01:12:55] just in case but that's probably bad
[01:12:57] this is also bad
[01:13:00] unlucky
[01:13:01] I just want to say that I think you are
[01:13:04] the handsomest and strong true also new
[01:13:08] villette can judge me any day yes he can
[01:13:33] yep
[01:13:48] oh they're dead
[01:13:53] foreign
[01:13:57] just [ __ ] burst and skill I don't
[01:14:00] even charge a lot like you I know you're
[01:14:01] supposed to but like I don't even
[01:14:02] [ __ ] charge shot
[01:14:04] just skill oh
[01:14:07] what
[01:14:15] okay I'm gonna take this moment to
[01:14:17] strategically disappear for five minutes
[01:14:20] because I'm currently dying and I don't
[01:14:21] know why so let me BRB but I can use
[01:14:23] this as click bait so that you guys know
[01:14:25] that when I'm back in three to five
[01:14:26] minutes I'm gonna level it
[01:14:28] so freak you chat

[01:15:38] Ardo DMG will snapshot xiangling's stats
[01:15:41] at the third swing during casting and
[01:15:43] will not be affected by changes in her
[01:15:46] stats that occur afterwards once a
[01:15:48] piranada deals DMG it has a 0.6 s
[01:15:52] cooldown before being able to deal D AMG
[01:15:55] to the same Target again it can deal AMG
[01:15:58] more than once per rotation if its
[01:16:00] hitbox remains in contact with an enemy
[01:16:03] for more than 0.6s
[01:16:06] foreign

[01:20:14] that what the hell Blitz
[01:20:18] what up okay maybe there's one good
[01:20:20] first time chatter
[01:20:23] okay let's get this bus for
[01:20:26] chat you know the rules nothing personal
[01:20:28] but every flat defense rule this gets
[01:20:31] someone will be banned randomly in chat
[01:20:36] I was kidding but
[01:20:38] okay yeah uh let's let's let's find
[01:20:40] let's find someone who typed flat death
[01:20:42] parade oh right in shotgun 12. oh it
[01:20:45] would be a shame it would envy will
[01:20:48] destroy your ayato okay you know what I
[01:20:49] don't even feel bad anymore 12 hours
[01:20:51] actually let me unban you one day
[01:20:55] and any last words oh you can't even
[01:20:57] type your last words because you're
[01:20:58] banned
[01:21:00] I bet all in Crete prayers
[01:21:03] dude that is actually so bad though
[01:21:06] okay it's just one rule like I genuinely
[01:21:09] like I'm being serious right now one
[01:21:10] roll is nothing it's just one roll dude
[01:21:12] it's literally one roll
[01:21:16] that's fine yam is uh not good on the
[01:21:18] set but it's fine this is good
[01:21:22] so far so good
[01:21:25] plink
[01:21:26] plink
[01:21:49] all right turn this my music up before
[01:21:51] leaving
[01:22:00] what I want I probably want crit damage
[01:22:02] because if it's 6.6 oh yeah Lenny
[01:22:04] doesn't even want okay I forgot about
[01:22:05] Lenny Lenny wants crit damage he doesn't
[01:22:07] even care about criterate that much or
[01:22:08] em or defense so there's really one stat
[01:22:11] that we want here
[01:22:12] okay
[01:22:13] well I mean it's a start it's not a bad
[01:22:17] flower it's just not a Lenny flower it's
[01:22:20] like a it's like a hutau hotel flower
[01:22:22] it's not bad
[01:22:27] 4780 HP that's good for your towel it's
[01:22:30] a lot of HP
[01:22:37] [Laughter]
[01:22:40] yeah that's kind of not great
[01:22:43] it's fine I forgot that on this set
[01:22:45] though like even pieces with no crit
[01:22:47] rate are good so if we get like crit
[01:22:48] damage attack or could damage ER we
[01:22:51] probably roll it
[01:22:55] it's basically it's basically blizzard
[01:22:57] chair
[01:23:02] like Lenny and ayaka start with exactly
[01:23:04] the same crit rate
[01:23:05] if you're running the set
[01:23:09] he's not dead
[01:23:18] I don't like canceling my burst like I
[01:23:20] know it's you're supposed to cancel your
[01:23:22] burst on the knee like it's optimal but
[01:23:23] I feel like it's cringe I don't know I
[01:23:24] like being a cat so I mean it's not
[01:23:26] cringe I just I want to be a cat
[01:23:30] I wish like you didn't want to cancel it
[01:23:33] this
[01:23:45] what can I do the thing
[01:23:48] [ __ ] when does it start
[01:23:57] s
[01:23:59] the only problem with DEA that I don't
[01:24:01] like is that her resistance erupting so
[01:24:03] slow or Not So Slow it lasts so like
[01:24:05] short that so little I can't speak
[01:24:08] English
[01:24:12] [Music]
[01:24:19] I don't know what
[01:24:21] okay
[01:24:29] I don't even want to finish that thought
[01:24:30] anymore
[01:24:31] I don't care
[01:24:41] minus three
[01:24:45] [Music]

[02:09:56] out of spite for out of spite for linear
[02:09:59] it's as if the
[02:10:01] it's as if they're trying to make the

[02:10:32] um
[02:10:34] the sucrose count
[02:10:37] can I play sucrose in a fairy team
[02:10:39] she has ears
[02:10:45] yes okay this team is broken I guess the
[02:10:48] net works too but Lynette is probably
[02:10:51] significantly worse than sucrose there
[02:10:53] but she's new
[02:11:24] okay we'll play Lynette the second clear
[02:11:26] we'll do two clears dude there's no way
[02:11:28] we could fit her here I mean I guess
[02:11:30] [ __ ] you girls I guess we could but
[02:11:32] she's like
[02:11:33] I guess
[02:11:37] but that means we have to play Lenny
[02:11:39] first half because I want to play Lenny
[02:11:40] second but if we play that team we have
[02:11:42] to put that team second
[02:11:49] in the three months

[02:12:12] actually need Hydro here so we probably
[02:12:13] do
[02:12:14] um
[02:12:15] there's no Hydro shielder
[02:12:17] singtroll me like he's not a shield

[02:23:43] I missed I missed the charge shot I
[02:23:45] missed the charge shot I'm a [ __ ]
[02:23:46] disgracer Pine all remains everywhere
[02:23:50] break
[02:23:51] uh well
[02:23:54] this game sucks okay uh
[02:23:59] nothing
[02:24:03] I have a question
[02:24:06] genuine question no flame literally no
[02:24:08] flame whatsoever because they're
[02:24:09] different characters who serve different
[02:24:11] teams but is there a reason why we would
[02:24:14] use Lynette there over sucrose
[02:24:25] let me make sure my Kiara is on the
[02:24:27] right side
[02:24:29] there she is let me make sure my
[02:24:35] I'm pretty sure sucrose on the right
[02:24:37] side
[02:24:38] balls
[02:24:40] balls
[02:25:10] Allah rude you
[02:25:15] I'll nip you in the bud
[02:25:25] dude imagine if we could use our team
[02:25:27] presets in the abyss like you like
[02:25:28] select from your teams and then you got
[02:25:30] like presets so you don't have to like
[02:25:31] scroll through your characters you
[02:25:32] imagine I can imagine
[02:25:47] [Music]
[02:25:55] I just hit my ears
[02:26:14] come on
[02:26:23] kind of compelling
[02:26:27] that wasn't the right word
[02:26:33] come on
[02:26:36] so do you see it
[02:26:48] well I'm gonna die
[02:26:54] I was like trying to just chill but
[02:27:00] dude
[02:27:08] oh did I go to the wrong one to group
[02:27:11] them it's the others wait is it the
[02:27:12] other side oh no that was this one
[02:27:15] yeah yeah
[02:27:19] surely they die though right
[02:27:21] sure they have enough damage to kill
[02:27:22] them without bursting I should have
[02:27:24] bursted fine
[02:27:31] well I only have one pillar nearby
[02:27:44] John surely it's normal to miss from
[02:27:46] time to time right like that's not a
[02:27:47] skill issue right
[02:27:48] surely that happens to the best of us
[02:27:50] and I would know because I am the best
[02:27:51] of us
[02:27:55] surely right surely that's not just like
[02:27:56] surely that is not a skill issue right
[02:27:58] surely it's happened surely it happens
[02:28:00] like Nice Shot nice try all good
[02:28:09] wait I didn't use my E I thought I used
[02:28:11] it yep
[02:28:15] calm down box
[02:28:18] nothing good comes from being too
[02:28:20] excited
[02:28:27] um I want to swirl but it's all dendro
[02:28:29] so I can't really swirl anything
[02:28:36] easy
[02:28:38] that was too close for comfort okay now
[02:28:40] we win
[02:28:42] now we win
[02:28:47] what is this oh these [ __ ]
[02:28:58] swirl them and then this
[02:29:00] foreign
[02:29:28] I knew he was low and then I forgore
[02:29:31] good damage though that was good
[02:29:37] guys over the hill that was good though
[02:29:40] that was actually good
[02:29:42] when he's cracked true and he's level uh
[02:29:45] one skill skill is actually a big part
[02:29:46] of that your damage when it's AOE like
[02:29:48] that because you hit all four so skill
[02:29:50] being leveled is actually relevant also
[02:29:52] it automatically say which like 20 DPS
[02:29:53] also balls
[02:29:57] but yeah also Ito should not be here
[02:29:58] ayito is doing nothing that is just
[02:30:00] these two things uh
[02:30:03] but iso's usually a shielder and
[02:30:04] shielders don't give you that much but
[02:30:05] you know someone like they are can you
[02:30:07] be miloth uh and be another pyro for
[02:30:10] your buff and then what's what's the the
[02:30:12] Zhang they can give you Petra so um
[02:30:14] yeah
[02:30:16] yo spatula
[02:30:21] yeah spatula
[02:30:27] wait what
[02:30:36] my little homie will get him get him
[02:30:38] homie
[02:30:39] yeah okay we do this
[02:30:43] I feel like you're supposed to burst at
[02:30:46] the end of your rotation but I always do
[02:30:47] it at the start I think at the end is
[02:30:49] more true when you have magical C
[02:30:50] because it lets you stack it up better
[02:30:52] but if you don't have it I don't think
[02:30:53] it matters
[02:30:55] like I like the birth of the start but
[02:30:58] in my God I say and is well both are
[02:31:00] fine but I feel like I like to end
[02:31:04] but I always just start
[02:31:08] okay I don't want to kill them though I
[02:31:09] need to heal
[02:31:11] the heel I need to get some energy
[02:31:27] I could lift you up sorry

[02:55:14] I'm sick and tired of seeing Xiao dude
[02:55:16] how else are we gonna clear okay second
[02:55:18] half is unironically really bad for
[02:55:19] Lenny but I want to play him second off
[02:55:28] man enough will be able to actually
[02:55:34] maybe we'll do first half
[02:55:54] who should replay second off I'll hide
[02:55:55] them I don't know how that was a good
[02:55:57] sword though
[02:56:03] I'm sorry to ask may I ask if you've
[02:56:05] already done the arkhan quest uh not yet
[02:56:09] but we will
[02:56:20] okay wait surely we can play surely we
[02:56:22] can play like Lenny
[02:56:24] and Lynette no I actually don't think we
[02:56:26] can clear
[02:56:27] I mean maybe
[02:56:34] no we probably can't
[02:56:53] Chad do you want to play shangling
[02:56:56] what if we play shangling
[02:56:59] tell me why shangling
[02:57:12] oh wait why are we playing China wait at
[02:57:15] this point why do we not have cars
[02:57:16] instead of Lenny
[02:57:18] okay
[02:57:19] um
[02:57:31] second side we could
[02:57:34] but I don't know if we have enough DPS
[02:57:36] like Brute Force the [ __ ] PMA
[02:57:40] we could do like
[02:57:41] um Big L where's Big L Big L Bennett
[02:57:45] uh we don't need takazo we could do like
[02:57:48] Zhang Lee or we could do kazua Daya or
[02:57:52] we could do zhangli
[02:57:54] I mean cause of day is not even a bad
[02:57:56] idea
[02:57:58] don't get to play deox I like dough
[02:58:05] uh here we could play Lynette
[02:58:09] yeah actually it is not bad here
[02:58:12] which is the first time I've ever said
[02:58:14] Dale's not bad
[02:58:15] it's actually pretty good with Lenny
[02:58:16] well like she's okay with Lenny there's
[02:58:18] still the nine second only resistance
[02:58:19] Interruption which sometimes it's not
[02:58:22] enough and then you get [ __ ] and then
[02:58:23] you hate everything but usually it's
[02:58:24] actually pretty good where's
[02:58:27] um wait I have no supports I'm gonna put
[02:58:28] a shot here as far as on actually never
[02:58:30] mind where's far as on

[03:03:18] while that is true you're looking
[03:03:20] definitely clear it is objectively false
[03:03:23] of you to think of dendro teams as worse
[03:03:25] any Denver team even if it's even if
[03:03:27] it's Cava even if it's Dory then worse
[03:03:29] than there uh you look sorry not you
[03:03:31] left physical teams
[03:03:43] but to be fair uh Geo is yellow physical
[03:03:45] and animal is green physical so
[03:03:49] everything is just colored physical
[03:03:54] [ __ ] I meant to hold
[03:04:03] it
[03:04:08] dude can you imagine Xiao but he's cryo
[03:04:11] and then shanha Buffs all your damage

[03:07:09] [ __ ] Hydro debuff
[03:07:23] foreign

[03:09:25] [Music]
[03:09:36] it's show time

[03:09:50] this cringe Abyss
[03:09:59] isn't it actually good yes
[03:10:03] he's good
[03:10:10] Brandon takes the 15 months so NADA
[03:10:12] things at five times
[03:10:24] as I asks I hope you're having a nice
[03:10:26] day
[03:10:31] I just I wish we had a good maliciously
[03:10:33] set
[03:10:38] France because we're basically running
[03:10:39] icon to be stupids instead of Blizzard's
[03:10:42] Trader which is like a pretty [ __ ]
[03:10:43] big difference
[03:10:47] kind of
[03:10:50] okay
[03:11:04] well if my e was leveled here I would
[03:11:06] press it and he would die oh no I
[03:11:08] actually wouldn't he probably wouldn't
[03:11:09] die there he's basically dead I'm gonna
[03:11:11] get hit here though yeah
[03:11:14] cute
[03:11:16] six
[03:11:27] okay
[03:11:28] um what the [ __ ] should I do now
[03:11:29] we did the abyss one I wanted to do
[03:11:41] golden troop ah yes but there's a slight
[03:11:45] problem
[03:11:46] with the golden troop farming
[03:11:50] I was gonna just spend all my fragiles
[03:11:51] on this domain today that was the plan
[03:11:53] but
[03:11:55] it it
[03:11:56] almost wasted to not start that video
[03:11:58] with it like resin already here
[03:12:01] so I don't know if I should wait till
[03:12:02] like tomorrow but I'm not sure let's at
[03:12:05] least do one run
[03:12:24] oh
[03:12:26] can you make one drown what if I should
[03:12:28] like there
[03:12:30] yeah you can wait where is he
[03:12:35] let me actually drowned Sage
[03:12:40] you do daily commissions dude I don't
[03:12:42] even have the font 10 uh sorry assume
[03:12:44] yeah font 10 commissions yeah
[03:12:48] I'd probably do some quests like the
[03:12:49] Arkham across some [ __ ]
[03:12:56] Hawaii
[03:13:05] oh he's not dead [ __ ]
[03:13:12] two done
[03:13:28] well probably she's not gonna cross
[03:13:30] though so that'll happen at some point
[03:13:32] that sucks okay well
[03:13:36] maybe it's a sign
[03:13:38] let me go to the blacksmith though I
[03:13:40] want to see if I can actually uh get the
[03:13:41] [ __ ] new weapons yet
[03:13:43] because apparently we can I heard people
[03:13:45] say I heard them say sorry apparently we
[03:13:49] can actually get them so as I'll try
[03:13:55] our Conquest took me all day what the
[03:13:58] [ __ ] well okay the nahita like the
[03:14:00] sumeru one took a while but I remember
[03:14:02] really liking it so I think it's if it
[03:14:04] like if it's good then it's worth
[03:14:06] so we'll see
[03:14:07] we'll probably stream it
[03:14:09] um soon
[03:14:10] wait where is the blacksmith
[03:14:13] no he's there what the [ __ ]
[03:14:29] am I dumb why why can't I go through
[03:14:31] here
[03:14:35] well
[03:14:36] yes I can't
[03:14:42] Court of fonten
[03:14:47] what's up oh their own names hey um
[03:14:50] they also don't have names
[03:14:53] wait there's actually wait we have to
[03:14:55] read these in school this oh my God I
[03:14:58] don't even that's just brought back
[03:14:59] memories the [ __ ] okay
[03:15:07] we have to read like [ __ ] like like
[03:15:09] stories like fables I guess of this dude
[03:15:12] called like [ __ ] what was it what was
[03:15:15] his first name
[03:15:17] Fountain fob
[03:15:22] yeah that was his name that was his
[03:15:25] [ __ ] name yeah
[03:15:27] wait what the [ __ ] is this
[03:15:30] oh
[03:15:32] um
[03:15:33] that's pretty cool
[03:15:40] I want this sword right
[03:15:47] damn it's actually really sick
[03:16:00] I think this looks good
[03:16:03] foreign
[03:16:04] oranges to make weapon recipes maybe the
[03:16:06] blacksmith is hungry
[03:16:14] oh you can get a silver sword
[03:16:17] sorry
[03:16:18] um
[03:16:19] rightful reward
[03:16:23] I could use this on yow
[03:16:31] this is pretty decent
[03:16:34] this one looks good
[03:16:36] this also looks pretty good do I want
[03:16:38] this attack but this is a lot of stats
[03:16:40] it's probably better than archaic but
[03:16:41] it's not better than like serpent spine
[03:16:43] or anything I have so no this one is
[03:16:45] actually also not bad
[03:16:51] also looks good
[03:17:06] now I don't know I mean I probably
[03:17:09] should unlock all of them but
[03:17:11] I really want the battle pass weapons
[03:17:13] those are the ones I want very very uh
[03:17:16] urgently
[03:17:19] well that's gonna take a while
[03:17:34] this is so cool
[03:17:39] let me guess you want the new spear shut
[03:17:42] up I I think the spear looks sick but
[03:17:44] I'm gonna do a I think I'm gonna pick
[03:17:46] sword

[03:17:49] all a lot of my characters are sharing a
[03:17:50] sword right now like I'll hide them and
[03:17:52] kaching and ayato want the same sword so
[03:17:55] having a battle pass one would be really
[03:17:56] nice
[03:18:02] yeah sword and spear seem to be the best
[03:18:04] ones the bow is fine too

[03:37:29] like you kind of I don't know

[03:37:33] Lee doesn't have any other sub stats
[03:37:35] that he wants like he doesn't really
[03:37:36] give a [ __ ] about anything because he's
[03:37:37] like ioko
[03:37:39] like he doesn't care about crit rate
[03:37:42] but I feel like a lot of his teams don't
[03:37:43] need much some of his teams do something
[03:37:45] seems need like 140.
[03:37:47] but a lot of his teams need like 110 120
[03:37:51] Maybe 130.

[03:38:32] a terrible [ __ ] artifact it's okay
[03:38:34] fourth one
[03:38:36] a win for believers could be good pyro
[03:38:38] goblet on the hydro set what if we get
[03:38:40] an element what
[03:38:46] what if we get
[03:38:47] Roki what if we got a character who uses
[03:38:50] hydro and and Pyro
[03:38:54] with a delusion and an illusion
[03:39:02] could be good
[03:39:18] what if we get a character who can
[03:39:20] vaporize by by himself
