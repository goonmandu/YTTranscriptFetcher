[00:36:55] like 28% crtical for who sein you think
[00:37:00] she deals death oh you're so cute I'm
[00:37:02] sorry I'm sorry my guy's not out so you
[00:37:05] have no way of knowing I'm sorry she
[00:37:07] does not deal damage if you use her
[00:37:08] burst you get you literally get locked
[00:37:11] in jail for 5 seconds you literally like
[00:37:14] it it literally 2C animation 2.5 second
[00:37:17] cast
[00:37:23] time oh yeah if you SE exin she becomes
[00:37:26] n Vette which is is cool I think C6 she
[00:37:28] becomes like a bit better than c0 nlet
[00:37:31] well not not better because you only
[00:37:33] have like you only have like uh what is
[00:37:36] it 2.5 plus 5 Seconds of L time 7.5 or
[00:37:38] is it plus four it's either 6.5 or 7.5
[00:37:42] or no 5.5 wait let me look this I
[00:37:44] forget uh Siege win
[00:37:50] C4 I mean I could just look at it in
[00:37:53] game it's plus three okay 5.5 seconds
[00:37:57] you can cancel by dashing my brother in
[00:38:01] Christ her burst animation is like two
[00:38:04] seconds you can't cancel the animation
[00:38:06] then if you use it you might as well
[00:38:07] [ __ ] use it but when you use it it's
[00:38:10] it's you have two Hydro apps on it
[00:38:12] unless they changed it it's two Hydro
[00:38:15] apps that's like a normal and then a
[00:38:18] charge attack on
[00:38:23] Barbara anyways we'll see I haven't
[00:38:26] played her yet so I could be totally
[00:38:27] wrong we'll play her
[00:38:29] today um
[00:38:33] anyways this weapon is good for sein uh
[00:38:36] okay for yolan but not her best slot and
[00:38:38] outside of that dog [ __ ] don't pull
[00:38:41] finina weapon what's cool too is
[00:38:43] farina's
[00:38:44] weapon is on this banner and in my
[00:38:47] opinion as one of farina's biggest fans
[00:38:51] I [ __ ] love finina and I think she's
[00:38:52] one of the
[00:38:55] strongest I mean yeah she's a really
[00:38:57] [ __ ] good five star okay I'm going to
[00:38:58] be honest she's insane uh you don't need
[00:39:00] her cuz you might have Singo [ __ ]
[00:39:02] yolan net whatever but she's really good
[00:39:05] okay with that said her weapon is is mid
[00:39:08] like her weapon's good but like if I'm
[00:39:11] pulling for a sword for my account i'
[00:39:12] I'd like festering desire is already
[00:39:14] really good on her if you have it you
[00:39:15] might not but like really good on her
[00:39:17] fav works and if i' have a sword on my
[00:39:19] account like a support sword I'd rather
[00:39:21] have key or uh Kazo weapon whatever it's
[00:39:23] called Freedom sworn and like for a
[00:39:25] damage weapon I'd rather just get Jade
[00:39:26] cutter or like Miss or something so like
[00:39:28] it's not bad it's really not bad but you
[00:39:30] don't need it at all even at like yeah
[00:39:35] so I I'm not a big fan of these weapons
[00:39:38] um it's it's not again it's not bad it's
[00:39:40] just you don't need it and then se's
[00:39:42] weapon is like arguably bad um and then
[00:39:46] for the four stars yeah you could use
[00:39:47] the pipe the [ __ ] the freet to play
[00:39:50] one
[00:39:52] um for the fourstar weapons five Lance
[00:39:55] like these are all old ass except lithic
[00:39:57] blade which is like a like a limited
[00:39:59] weapon uh the other ones are like really
[00:40:01] old so if you've been playing and or
[00:40:03] pulling for like since at least a year
[00:40:05] or two you probably have a lot of them
[00:40:07] but fav Lance is really good fa codex
[00:40:10] is either good or useless depending on
[00:40:12] who you run Lions Roar everyone has it
[00:40:14] sack bow no one really cares but it's
[00:40:16] viable on some characters and then
[00:40:18] lithic Blade no one really cares but
[00:40:20] it's viable on some characters so kind
[00:40:21] of what I don't really like this Banner
[00:40:23] uh the the four stars on the character
[00:40:25] Banners are not bad ging is good Rosaria
[00:40:27] is good uh the the thing with Rosaria is
[00:40:30] like her she's a good character her C2
[00:40:32] is really good afterwards you don't
[00:40:34] really care about cons like C5 I think
[00:40:36] gives burst C3 or five gives burst
[00:40:37] damage which is good but like outside of
[00:40:39] that is kind of whatever uh
[00:40:41] Noel is old the like everyone like no
[00:40:44] the thing with Noel is like you probably
[00:40:45] have her like you either don't use her
[00:40:47] or you have her C6 but on the off chance
[00:40:50] you want to you don't have her C6 and
[00:40:52] you want to use her with finina she can
[00:40:53] be pretty good so it's not like a bad
[00:40:55] Banner it's just yeah it's okay it's
[00:40:58] okay it's not like insane it's
[00:41:01] okay yeah Gaming's good though so
[00:41:06] like honestly yeah it's it's not bad but
[00:41:09] yeah no
[00:41:10] cave for sein though it's
[00:41:15] like I guess you could play her free as
[00:41:17] the I mean yeah you can it doesn't
[00:41:19] really
[00:41:21] matter finina with gaming is actually
[00:41:23] pretty POG too because if you're pulling
[00:41:24] gaming you probably want finina like
[00:41:26] you're probably going to do I don't know
[00:41:28] when I was playing him I didn't even
[00:41:29] release my [ __ ] guide but when I was
[00:41:30] playing him I was doing gaming shun
[00:41:33] finina Bennett like the S like the
[00:41:34] [ __ ] sh team well I guess you're not
[00:41:36] running for farz on but like the the
[00:41:37] standard chanun team and I was just
[00:41:39] playing gaming was really it was pretty
[00:41:40] good so yeah you you like getting finina
[00:41:42] with gaming is is pretty
[00:41:48] good
[00:41:51] yeah um we have like eight videos to
[00:41:54] react to but I also want to play genin
[00:41:55] and I want to play sewin so
[00:42:01] cedin Pros you can skip her
[00:42:05] yeah she's um in my opinion she's just
[00:42:07] like comfy Overworld or like healer like
[00:42:11] that's it like you don't need her at all
[00:42:13] she's kind of whatever she feels in like
[00:42:16] we haven't played her yet but like she
[00:42:19] feels
[00:42:22] like a fourar like yeah she kind of
[00:42:26] feels like a four star like she is okay
[00:42:28] her her her e is okay her E is good with
[00:42:31] her passive everything else is like I
[00:42:34] don't
[00:42:36] care like her burst I don't care her nor
[00:42:39] like her normal charge attack hold E I
[00:42:40] don't give a [ __ ] it's literally just uh
[00:42:43] her skill actually has a big healing for
[00:42:47] your whole team that's an advantage and
[00:42:49] it gives you skill damage bonus to your
[00:42:51] off Field characters so she synergizes
[00:42:54] well with like finina or a lot of other
[00:42:57] standard characters uh not standard
[00:42:59] characters I I read standard in my chat
[00:43:01] or a lot of other skill damage
[00:43:02] characters but like even in those teams
[00:43:05] a lot of the times another healer can be
[00:43:08] better like you might want Shen Yun for
[00:43:09] Nemo you might want baiju for dendro you
[00:43:11] might want kie you might want so like
[00:43:13] her healing is really is genuinely good
[00:43:16] like her healing is
[00:43:18] good but it's like there's a lot of
[00:43:21] other options you can like she's just
[00:43:22] kind of eh um also her Hydro application
[00:43:25] is dog [ __ ] uh and so kakomi
[00:43:29] is like on field kakomi is way more
[00:43:33] versatile because you can onfield kokomi
[00:43:35] off field cin is I mean could be better
[00:43:38] you lose thrilling Tails which is the
[00:43:40] main like it kind of hurts akaka or
[00:43:42] whatever but she can still be better if
[00:43:44] you are running finina cuz you'll get
[00:43:45] more stacks and you don't have to play
[00:43:47] inside of jellyfish's Circle however
[00:43:49] kakomi is a
[00:43:51] fish so truly the DEH of hydro
[00:43:58] there's no way she's better I mean she's
[00:44:00] not a better character than kakomi but
[00:44:01] there's teams with finina where if
[00:44:03] you're just purely off field the healing
[00:44:05] you get from an AOE healer will be
[00:44:06] better than a single Target healer and
[00:44:08] they can both run like they'll both run
[00:44:10] the same set it's just kokomi gives you
[00:44:12] throwing Tails which is good uh SE gives
[00:44:14] you skill damage which will give you
[00:44:15] maybe like a 20% increase to your finina
[00:44:19] damage
[00:44:21] um so there are situations where she
[00:44:24] like again she's not like ever but
[00:44:27] there's teams where she can be a good
[00:44:29] choice like that's all like she's you
[00:44:31] know if you want her get her but she's
[00:44:32] not like I'm not going to recommend you
[00:44:33] get her she's not like ideal I was kind
[00:44:36] of Doom posting her like a week ago um
[00:44:40] but since then I've calmed down a bit
[00:44:41] she's just kind of like yeah you
[00:44:44] know anyways we'll play
[00:44:52] [Music]
[00:44:53] her anyways uh outside of that we missed
[00:44:56] a lot of things
[00:44:57] uh we're going to play her so don't
[00:44:59] worry I have to watch the demo to stream
[00:45:01] my sub
[00:45:04] expired we have to watch this we were in
[00:45:06] a [ __ ] ad as like we were in the

[00:45:10] see
[00:45:11] this new finina reviews out SM Mark new
[00:45:16] vid finina because as mentioned earlier
[00:45:20] any DPS character you're running with
[00:45:21] finina can just go Mary Hunter as either
[00:45:24] their best camera
[00:45:28] why am I lagging okay sorry or a solid
[00:45:31] viable alternative oh also I forgot to
[00:45:33] mention regarding Fin's builds pretty
[00:45:35] straightforward but there's actually
[00:45:36] something really cool which is regarding
[00:45:37] her goblet uh you might know this by now

[01:49:37] [ __ ] easy make sure you take good
[01:49:39] care of yourself okay we don't want
[01:49:41] anything happening to

[01:49:49] up oh okay we might have to fun then I
[01:49:54] can't see I'm on chatterino usually at
[01:49:56] home I'm on like normal twitch chat so I
[01:49:57] can see I can

[01:50:13] crazy oh
[01:50:18] Rosario I mean honestly you could still
[01:50:21] give it because like
[01:50:23] [ __ ] the doubters true it doesn't hurt
[01:50:26] it just hurts the doubters no but it's
[01:50:27] probably a scam wait let me look let me
[01:50:29] look slash let me see what it look like
[01:50:31] in terms of hydro app and healing you
[01:50:34] okay chatterino doesn't work for chat
[01:50:35] commands unless I'm just
[01:50:37] stupid oh yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:50:39] yeah it's definitely rigged 64 voted
[01:50:42] believe okay that's crazy wait why is it
[01:50:44] not can you not close the Gamba is there
[01:50:46] no way I thought you could

[01:51:12] loss hope you're doing well congrats on
[01:51:14] the early actually no we're refunding so
[01:51:15] what I just said doesn't make sense if
[01:51:17] you're a doubter consider yourself
[01:51:18] spared you should have lost
[01:51:27] that's actually
[01:51:31] crazy okay what if to make it up to
[01:51:33] Believers I ban five random
[01:51:36] doubters all right one
[01:51:40] day uh one
[01:51:42] hour Perma ban until a mod looks at you
[01:51:45] uh LOL W Believers uh one day
[01:51:50] uh saved one
[01:51:54] minute all
[01:51:59] right dude sorry I'm sorry okay I didn't
[01:52:02] know the gamble was still open I I would
[01:52:03] have stalled if I knew I would have
[01:52:05] stalled okay we got sein woo let's play
[01:52:07] her okay before we do first of
[01:52:21] all C2 using her skill and burst cedin
[01:52:26] can create a bubbly Shield worth 30% of
[01:52:28] her Max HP the bubbly Shield would
[01:52:30] persist
[01:52:31] no
[01:52:34] additionally that opponent's Hydro res
[01:52:36] will be decreased by
[01:52:43] 35% dude if this was in the base kit
[01:52:52] like this is sick
[01:53:08] but whale unit
[01:53:11] yeah it's okay
[01:53:27] I got sigin C1 early wait does that have
[01:53:30] C2 actually is it is it a Self shield is
[01:53:33] it like sein only like does it disappear
[01:53:34] if you
[01:53:36] swap so position until sein finishes
[01:53:38] using relevant skills oh yeah it's only
[01:53:41] for her okay yeah it's not a
[01:53:46] shield it's just like yeah
[01:53:55] minus 18 months
[01:53:58] aware but the hydro res is still [ __ ]
[01:54:02] stupid
[01:54:06] anyways [ __ ] essay of text why do
[01:54:09] they do this for every font 10 character
[01:54:10] this is like the longest text in the
[01:54:12] world it's
[01:54:15] okay all right anyways
[01:54:20] see only got one ging but is what it
[01:54:29] is I need this
[01:54:33] team okay so we're going to play I don't
[01:54:35] even know what I want to play I mean I
[01:54:36] guess you can play in like [ __ ]
[01:54:38] freeze but
[01:54:50] like yeah let me make a few
[01:54:57] teams uh yeah let me make a few teams
[01:54:59] where's AA she's level 80 I
[01:55:01] think AA wait why the [ __ ] does she not
[01:55:04] have a skin working with
[01:55:14] you AA
[01:55:17] siinn
[01:55:20] Shena kazua
[01:55:23] understood I just have to stand here
[01:55:27] right and then we'll probably do
[01:55:31] like I don't [ __ ]
[01:55:34] know I don't want to play arino I want
[01:55:37] to play like some pyro characters
[01:55:38] haven't figured out which one I mean it
[01:55:39] might just be Shang Ling but I'll just
[01:55:41] use Hut as a placeholder I mean I guess
[01:55:43] this works
[01:55:44] but here you bro might weap
[01:55:56] I have highes for
[01:56:00] Journey maybe hello Mr z Oh I wanted to
[01:56:03] do double Hydro freeze as well get
[01:56:14] okay
[01:56:16] understood I just have to stand here
[01:56:19] right okay the problem is if we play Yia
[01:56:21] the team's going to feel bad even if it
[01:56:24] like just at a baseline uh NE is also
[01:56:27] something I wanted to do I forgot uh I
[01:56:29] should have pre these teams before I
[01:56:30] started stream but it's fine NE we'll
[01:56:32] put Nita in
[01:56:34] here uh cedra will be our
[01:56:37] healer where's Nita level
[01:56:40] 90
[01:56:41] cedin still we need someone on full em
[01:56:44] to proc Bloom here our Hydro app is dog
[01:56:47] [ __ ] right now honestly I mean that's
[01:56:49] why you play kokomi but we could like on
[01:56:51] field some
[01:56:55] [ __ ] we could just fullem honestly we
[01:56:58] could [ __ ] fullem Nita
[01:57:02] but cave I don't know about that
[01:57:13] one it might be em Nita it could also be
[01:57:16] uh it could also be like [ __ ] Al
[01:57:18] height them or some [ __ ] y l donated $1
[01:57:22] 23 cents add your l or I will
[01:57:26] terrorism I'm not adding
[01:57:28] Yol wait we have cole I
[01:57:34] think run ayo
[01:57:53] there's no reason to play her if I'm
[01:57:54] running Kookie cuz like why the [ __ ]
[01:57:56] would you run a Healer so I think we
[01:57:57] would need to do
[01:58:02] like like [ __ ] em Ryden or something
[01:58:04] or maybe
[01:58:06] like this is probably going to be the
[01:58:08] worst team of all time this might be the
[01:58:10] worst team of all time but like I kind
[01:58:12] of want to try it
[01:58:16] anesthetics CU like why wouldn't you
[01:58:18] just play Kookie I mean I guess you
[01:58:19] could just em you just hype them on Soo
[01:58:21] and then
[01:58:32] whatever sounds good to me like even
[01:58:34] here you don't need to healer with
[01:58:35] Claren why would you play
[01:58:38] this maybe if it's like kach finish this
[01:58:41] quickly you can play
[01:58:43] this is is she better than [ __ ] I
[01:58:46] mean she's useless here though she's
[01:58:47] just a worst kakomi cuz there's no skill
[01:58:49] damage okay I need to build my team
[01:58:51] around a [ __ ] character
[01:58:52] that actually does skill damage so like
[01:58:54] [ __ ] ficial in the name of the
[01:59:01] princess well since you asked so nicely
[01:59:04] but then you're not playing ceg here
[01:59:05] you're just playing [ __ ]
[01:59:08] Kazo yeah okay I don't like this idea
[01:59:10] this idea
[01:59:14] sucks it's probably just fin honestly I
[01:59:18] knew you'd miss
[01:59:20] me I mean I guess taser
[01:59:22] works yeah okay we can play taser I
[01:59:25] forgot taser existed for a
[01:59:29] second okay that works
[01:59:40] um wait this team without oh my God I'm
[01:59:43] lagging this team without finina feels
[01:59:45] just like objectively worse kokomi with
[01:59:47] finina could be better though but
[01:59:53] cuz you at least buff the skill damage
[01:59:54] on finina and you get more healing for
[01:59:55] the
[01:59:57] stacks but I guess you B Shena here
[02:00:00] right cuz you're not not running an Nemo
[02:00:02] there's no way you don't run an
[02:00:03] Nemo you have no
[02:00:15] battery activate rizzly
[02:00:18] C1 maybe all right let me leveler
[02:00:21] honestly I might
[02:00:27] dude I pre-formed oh yeah yeah yeah I
[02:00:30] pre okay I'm like low on XP for some
[02:00:31] reason but I pre-formed ritim flowers
[02:00:35] and water that failed to
[02:00:39] transcend okay I might need more XP
[02:00:41] books
[02:00:45] though but XP books are easy it doesn't
[02:00:50] matter okay

[02:40:28] 15K ticks it's like it's yeah it's like
[02:40:32] it's okay but like why wouldn't you just
[02:40:33] do this right like that's just
[02:40:38] more so it's not worth the field
[02:40:43] time but I mean you know
[02:40:46] wiri that's kind of irrelevant cuz
[02:40:48] you're not pressing her Q
[02:40:53] ever you can jump out of it wait can you
[02:40:56] don't fall I swe it's medical oh yeah
[02:41:00] you can that's [ __ ] funny let's
[02:41:11] see oh
[02:41:15] Dash I can dash out of there too
[02:41:19] I mean canceling it's not use like you
[02:41:21] never want to [ __ ] cancel that [ __ ]
[02:41:23] you either you usually just don't use
[02:41:25] it like if you're going through the
[02:41:27] animation you better have a good reason
[02:41:31] toow
[02:41:41] your calm
[02:41:46] down I swear it's for medical
[02:42:08] try charge attack nope there is no
[02:42:09] reason to does
[02:42:13] nothing there's nothing so you you
[02:42:17] basically just you do this you B you
[02:42:19] don't even hold E I think you literally
[02:42:20] just press e and then Swap and then she
[02:42:22] Buffs your skill damage and she Buffs
[02:42:24] and she heals and gives you
[02:42:28] clam Sig win is so adorable it's not
[02:42:31] capping the clam set but
[02:42:35] like
[02:42:44] 25k H I'm just stuff down

[02:46:46] closet just kidding I don't know what
[02:46:48] the [ __ ] for usually that's like for the
[02:46:50] intercom like they'll do that and
[02:46:51] they'll say something but literally
[02:46:52] there like and then so I assume they
[02:46:55] misclicked I mean maybe there's a fire
[02:46:56] and I'm about to die hopefully not but I
[02:46:58] assume they misclicked I looked outside
[02:46:59] I left like the apartment door I opened
[02:47:01] it and no one was there so I don't know
[02:47:03] what the [ __ ]

[02:48:24] sorry okay the only thing I need to know
[02:48:26] for the guide we can do fun stuff after
[02:48:28] the only thing I need to go is like the
[02:48:30] only thing I need to know is like her
[02:48:32] healing cuz the rest I already know I I
[02:48:35] wasn't fully aware of how her bouncing
[02:48:37] [ __ ] worked now I I get it uh her
[02:48:40] healing seems to be like good cuz it's
[02:48:44] AOE so she works with finina but outside
[02:48:46] of that and the skill damage buff else
[02:48:49] in her kid is like no one cares so she's
[02:48:50] kind of just like not good but like
[02:48:55] usable so yeah
[02:49:05] P let's
[02:49:08] see I'm trying to get I should probably
[02:49:10] get energy oh my leg sorry sorry sorry I
[02:49:13] have Stu open sorry sorry sorry sorry
[02:49:15] sorry sorry sorry I'm sorry for existing
[02:49:17] I'm sorry
[02:49:21] how impactful is her C1 for her High
[02:49:24] feeling you can be honest project Sask
[02:49:27] no one gives a [ __ ] about C1 C2 is
[02:49:29] really
[02:49:40] [Music]
[02:49:45] good thank you for the lunch break
[02:49:47] entertainment King p s never streaming
[02:49:49] actual
[02:49:51] NOS yeah I don't know why I'm live so
[02:49:53] early
[02:49:55] but the reflection I mean I'm looking at
[02:49:58] uh
[02:49:59] scalings it's not it's nothing leaked
[02:50:01] it's official info I just like the
[02:50:02] layout of this website I'm looking at
[02:50:04] scalings
[02:50:21] it's not Suk it's not
[02:50:40] Suk
[02:50:45] yeah yeah so I'm looking like other
[02:50:48] characters healing Skilling just to
[02:50:50] compare uh her healing is like if this
[02:50:53] was single Target it would be like
[02:50:54] pretty average compared to a lot of the
[02:50:56] single Target healers in fact slightly
[02:50:57] better because you get 30% healing
[02:51:00] bonus however it's to three characters
[02:51:04] at once and then your last hit is a big
[02:51:06] hit but it's only to Siege win so like
[02:51:09] it's good for capping clam or song well
[02:51:11] not capping but for like a decent amount
[02:51:13] of clam or song of days past and it syes
[02:51:16] with Farina and then you get uh 2,800
[02:51:19] skill damage like a flat additive like
[02:51:23] it's like shanai squl basically but to
[02:51:25] any off field skill
[02:51:27] damage the only thing I don't like about
[02:51:29] this is
[02:51:30] that it's not
[02:51:34] um I don't like that it's off field only
[02:51:37] like I wish I could use this with like
[02:51:38] C6
[02:51:41] sh but yeah she's an onfield healer I
[02:51:45] can't okay I mean I don't like this
[02:51:48] character that much but you're dumb you
[02:51:49] literally do this and then that's her
[02:51:50] whole rotation she spends one second on
[02:51:53] field like if you're going to Doom post
[02:51:55] at least do it correctly like you can't
[02:51:57] just be
[02:52:02] lying but yeah can she use Mill it yeah
[02:52:04] she can her her e bounces five to seven
[02:52:07] times off field
[02:52:28] T this is just from picking up the this
[02:52:30] you get from picking up the
[02:52:34] balls 10 Stacks I mean the hydro damage
[02:52:37] bonus is why would you put 8% like this
[02:52:39] feels like such an insult like it
[02:52:41] doesn't matter if this like it doesn't
[02:52:42] matter cuz you're not using sein for
[02:52:44] damage but like why would it be eight
[02:52:46] like that feels so like who picked
[02:52:58] 8%
[02:53:04] well can you play as an onfield DPS
[02:53:06] while using ficial eii and finina no
[02:53:09] well okay you said you cannot can you
[02:53:11] yes but like at that point why don't you
[02:53:13] just Auto attack on like okay like yes
[02:53:15] you can use her burst but that's not
[02:53:16] onfield DPS it has 2. 5 Seconds of up
[02:53:19] time 2.5 after which you're Auto
[02:53:22] attacking on Yim Miko so like yeah
[02:53:24] there's situations where like okay you
[02:53:25] have nothing to do you can press q but
[02:53:28] that like you also need a lot of er if
[02:53:30] you do that like you should onfield your
[02:53:33] Y at that point yeah is is Z on field
[02:53:35] without dendro is a bit more cope but
[02:53:37] like if it's taser you can still proc a
[02:53:39] bunch of Electro charges it's fine
[02:53:48] finina tenacity no no
[02:53:50] no I hate meith finina I'm a MTH finina
[02:53:53] [ __ ] hater it's optimal sometimes
[02:53:56] like there's some teams where you can
[02:53:57] use it but like I don't like
[02:54:10] it well I need to put a waypoint here
[02:54:13] I'm at a way point trying to call home
[02:54:17] all of my
[02:54:19] I spent on
[02:54:23] you for Char killing's ass it is
[02:54:26] literally attack percent unless I'm
[02:54:29] freaking forgetting
[02:54:33] something yeah like I don't even I'm not
[02:54:35] even mentioning that like dude
[02:54:40] like really that's what you're trying to
[02:54:43] [ __ ] show
[02:54:45] me I mean it's it's cute I guess
[02:54:59] can you build her em and play her in
[02:55:01] hyper Bloom Soo okay Pop Quiz hyper blo
[02:55:04] quiz what does Elemental Mastery do in
[02:55:07] hyper
[02:55:08] blo it gives you more damage on the
[02:55:10] hyper blo okay who is the character
[02:55:12] triggering hyper blo is it a hydro B
[02:55:16] dendro or C Electro ding ding ding
[02:55:19] Electro so your sinos em matters your
[02:55:21] sein doesn't so going em on her does
[02:55:23] nothing unless you're like the one
[02:55:25] blooming in a bloom team but she has
[02:55:27] such [ __ ] Hydro op that there's like no
[02:55:29] way like if you
[02:55:34] yeah no
[02:55:40] okay all right wait wait let me show you
[02:55:41] guys something okay watch
[02:55:46] this three 3 745 3745 that's the whole
[02:55:51] team right everyone's HP is going up
[02:55:52] riz's already full boom and then last
[02:55:58] bounce wait why didn't I see
[02:56:07] it I should have swwa the seed wait does
[02:56:10] the last bounce give a a small healing
[02:56:12] to everyone and a big one to ceden is
[02:56:13] that how it works five
[02:56:16] Bing or is the 5 one just
[02:56:21] seedin wait I wasn't I know the big
[02:56:24] one's just a seedin but I don't know if
[02:56:25] it also gives a small one I guess it
[02:56:27] doesn't I I think I miss time that one
[02:56:33] sec oh it's fina's passive okay yeah
[02:56:36] yeah I have to swap out of finina you're
[02:56:43] right go to the Fontan hot
[02:56:45] water is it that fast not bad
[02:56:48] that no need
[02:57:07] to you've died there multiple
[02:57:12] times okay
[02:57:14] sorry okay wait wait one sec
[02:57:20] whoa what
[02:57:22] the
[02:57:23] uh are you sure it has to be
[02:57:26] me [ __ ] I thought my scar was on
[02:57:30] HP wait
[02:57:33] but wibbly
[02:57:40] wobbly 4 four four or 44 and then the
[02:57:44] last one I didn't see it it's like I
[02:57:47] can't see the I mean I guess I could
[02:57:49] just C the
[02:57:51] HP okay I could do this later I got do
[02:57:53] this off stream it's
[02:57:55] fine it's definitely more if I hold e
[02:57:58] and pick up the things well even if I
[02:57:59] don't hold E I just need to pick up the
[02:58:01] things and then it goes to well I can't
[02:58:03] see the number but wait now I can
[02:58:08] 4496 it's also without Hydro resonance
[02:58:13] anyways anyways um I I can figure that
[02:58:17] out later look at the Hydra wait let me
[02:58:19] let me show you the Hydra
[02:58:21] app this one's a little
[02:58:26] cope this one I'm going to be honest I
[02:58:28] don't know who was designing her burst
[02:58:30] this way this one I'm not a big fan of
[02:58:33] the healing it's okay like it's pretty
[02:58:35] good but the the burst I don't really
[02:58:37] understand time to
[02:58:40] go Wind Rises
[02:58:48] uh let's climb this swen
[02:58:53] Fury and let's count how many swirls we
[02:58:55] get
[02:59:04] Beth he might feel a little pretty
[02:59:08] one
[02:59:10] two calm down
[02:59:18] at least the skill applies Hydro not
[02:59:21] like the most but more than her [ __ ]
[02:59:23] burst
[02:59:29] okay yeah her burst is literally
[02:59:31] unlocked at C6 and I'm not even
[02:59:33] joking like this one swirl swirl oh no
[02:59:37] that one didn't swirl
[02:59:39] swirl I guess it's every two hits but
[02:59:42] yeah the the Q
[02:59:44] is not ideal
[02:59:55] first bad Hydro festar wait that might
[02:59:57] actually be
[02:59:59] true unless you count Hydro MC but
[03:00:02] they're not really a five
[03:00:07] staral
[03:00:10] down what the [ __ ] are you
[03:00:15] doing yeah so it looks like every two
[03:00:17] hit swirls
[03:00:25] but still
[03:00:49] all right
[03:00:55] anyways like the the point of her is AOE
[03:00:59] healing skill bonus and clam that's it
[03:01:01] that's that's all like that that's it
[03:01:03] everything else in her kit don't touch
[03:01:06] like the point of her is you just skill
[03:01:08] and then you get the like Devil's
[03:01:10] Advocate you get the convenience of AOE
[03:01:12] team healing from off field and a bit of
[03:01:16] hydro like not good Hydro app but a
[03:01:19] little bit of hydro and not needing to
[03:01:20] stay in ki's like jellyfish so like if
[03:01:23] you're playing freeze like like it's not
[03:01:27] I don't know like I I wouldn't pull her
[03:01:30] but like you can use her there
[03:01:59] yeah if she was a fourar I would be
[03:02:01] really happy cuz her C6 makes her like
[03:02:04] well I guess her constellations wouldn't
[03:02:05] be this good if she's a extrem after
[03:02:08] like CU C2 and C6 are like C2 is pretty
[03:02:11] cracked well it's not even like like
[03:02:13] broken but it's like definitely a good
[03:02:15] C2
[03:02:18] all anyways we should probably do a
[03:02:25] clear do I
[03:02:27] replace what the [ __ ] does a double
[03:02:29] Hydro freeze team even look
[03:02:46] like probably just
[03:02:48] this I mean yeah it's probably rizzly
[03:02:51] honestly and then Shena I mean but I
[03:02:54] feel like no swirl is like Omega cope am
[03:02:56] I
[03:03:05] wrong yeah IO will have no ER in that
[03:03:08] team you're
[03:03:09] right well that's what I was thinking
[03:03:11] but I was like I might just be this
[03:03:14] honestly should I activate justly C1 so
[03:03:17] it doesn't look too bad no I can't I
[03:03:25] can't okay another problem with this is
[03:03:28] like no offense to rizzly but he's he's
[03:03:30] not he's he's not bad but he's like kind
[03:03:32] of mid so like using a bad character
[03:03:35] with a mid character won't make for like
[03:03:37] the best team but it's okay
[03:03:41] um that's way too much crit
[03:03:43] rate freak you no he's he's not bad he's
[03:03:46] a decent carry the thing with a carry is
[03:03:48] like if you're like decent like you're
[03:03:51] not bad but you're not amazing it's fine
[03:03:53] like you can still play the carry and be
[03:03:55] chilling with a support it's kind of
[03:03:57] like there's so many good
[03:04:00] options
[03:04:04] yeah 50 gifted you see1 okay 50 gifted
[03:04:08] I'll activate NE uh rizle see1
[03:04:19] where's my feather it's on

[03:20:56] Shia is there anything stopping me from

[03:21:07] finina okay I'll play
[03:21:10] Bennett
[03:21:11] Ben second
[03:21:15] half there what the [ __ ] do I want to
[03:21:17] play
[03:21:21] um yeah
[03:21:29] hey Navia Navia
[03:21:40] works I kind of like Navia more first
[03:21:45] half but I mean
[03:21:57] good play
[03:22:09] taser BS taser run okay I think we do
[03:22:13] taser then we do I think we do hazer
[03:22:17] then we
[03:22:19] do either hyper bloom or the team we
[03:22:24] just said but have short-term memory
[03:22:25] loss I don't remember what the [ __ ] I
[03:22:26] just said Navia and then afterwards we
[03:22:29] bench sein and we Farm resin or like
[03:22:32] pull for Firefly or
[03:22:35] something all right anyways someone need
[03:22:38] run an ad uh
[03:22:40] oh well I guess I have to do
[03:22:45] that cedin bench look I'm an honest man
[03:22:48] I'm not hiding anything I'm not going to
[03:22:50] play her for very long I don't think
[03:22:51] she's amazing but you know I still want
[03:22:54] to test her and make a video on her if
[03:22:56] you like her but uh she's not my
[03:22:59] favorite I think she's a bit
[03:23:05] underpowered like if we only had two
[03:23:07] healers in the game it'd be like okay
[03:23:09] cool Hydro healer AOE healing uh can use
[03:23:12] clam gives you skill damage it's like
[03:23:15] okay but it's like there's so many good
[03:23:17] healers like a lot of times you just put
[03:23:18] Shen Yun on your team BYU in your team
[03:23:20] Gan in your team [ __ ] even
[03:23:23] kokomi so
[03:23:26] yeah Bennett Kookie
[03:23:29] like she her only in my opinion she's
[03:23:32] good with finina that's like
[03:23:34] it and even then as I said there's a lot
[03:23:37] of
[03:23:37] options now like that's not really true
[03:23:41] like you could use her in like any
[03:23:42] generic [ __ ] Hydro team for the skill
[03:23:45] damage but like like in those teams
[03:23:46] you'd rather have someone with more
[03:23:47] Hydra app
[03:23:49] usually uh I'm trying to find something
[03:23:51] oh yeah someone even run an ad I dude I
[03:23:52] don't want do I have to run an ad what
[03:23:54] if like the ad is me talking about
[03:23:56] [ __ ] seed win isn't that technically
[03:23:57] an
[03:24:02] ad okay one more also I have no clue if
[03:24:05] my chind is geared wait I'm on
[03:24:07] thundering Fury can I use thundering
[03:24:09] Fury in this team probably shouldn't I
[03:24:11] mean I can like we're electroch charging
[03:24:14] but I mean IO can go TS in taser like
[03:24:17] you can I have enough
[03:24:21] app but
[03:24:23] like [ __ ]
[03:24:25] it out like a
[03:24:34] light everyone's good the finina okay
[03:24:37] kind of but also no cuz you could end up
[03:24:39] like M Dash hey everybody M Dash here I
[03:24:41] don't have a good healer for finina she
[03:24:43] sucks I'm paraphrasing that's not what
[03:24:45] he said but like
[03:24:47] a good healer for Fina does matter it's
[03:24:49] just there's a lot of them like like at
[03:24:50] this point there's like you know there's
[03:24:52] not just one team you can
[03:24:57] run also I just shanu at the start of my
[03:25:00] rotation cuz I'm [ __ ]

[03:25:11] the way my PES are doing a lot less oh

[03:42:00] idea wait Chad thoughts
[03:42:04] on thoughts on
[03:42:08] this cuz if you play K cookie then why
[03:42:11] are you playing by benture if you're
[03:42:13] playing finina then you're not playing
[03:42:15] quick and bench Soo if you're
[03:42:17] playing uh BYU you don't really have
[03:42:20] much dendro well I mean BYU works but
[03:42:22] it's not like enough D for
[03:42:25] like team is ass in
[03:42:29] multi-wave yes but
[03:42:35] like these are single
[03:42:38] Target eight cycle
[03:42:42] dispatch dude
[03:42:58] I mean I could do the same but with
[03:43:00] Claren no what's the difference here oh
[03:43:03] no I don't have a hyper Bloomer Claren
[03:43:05] doesn't really want to be I mean I guess
[03:43:06] she can you could go em sans's
[03:43:09] lowii honestly maybe I do go em s Loi it
[03:43:13] is still a quick in team though
[03:43:22] I mean okay the problem with the
[03:43:23] multi-wave content isn't really Sino
[03:43:25] it's more like well it is so it's Soo
[03:43:28] and Nita
[03:43:30] like okay I'm okay we're gonna do this
[03:43:33] we're gonna do this it's fine second
[03:43:34] half we'll carry we'll play [ __ ] nlet
[03:43:36] finina
[03:43:38] uh Kaz Le classic sorry view characters
[03:43:43] Soo are you geared my king my
[03:43:45] Prince oh that's not my normal build
[03:43:54] though um I'm blooming right
[03:43:58] now they don't know but I'm like
[03:44:07] blooming I'm going to run more ER just
[03:44:09] because I have a phobia of missing oh oh
[03:44:13] oh oh chat look at this look at this
[03:44:14] piece is this dude I was literally I I
[03:44:16] forgot I had this but like if I need ER
[03:44:19] on a TF User it's like
[03:44:22] insane oh but I'm hyper bloing so I want
[03:44:24] more em like I want more em than just
[03:44:27] 187 so I think we'll do I'm on 5tf so I
[03:44:31] can run a piece that has like em
[03:44:36] Subs any em
[03:44:38] Subs uh this has yeah gives me too much
[03:44:41] crit rate though right T
[03:44:59] still kind of low em but like it's
[03:45:03] fine I'm running more ER than I need
[03:45:06] just in Cas like I don't want to like
[03:45:07] reset a million times that's
[03:45:10] why cuz I could run this piece like I
[03:45:12] could run plus 63m if I do that
[03:45:16] I mean 122 is not even that much
[03:45:17] honestly yeah I might I might it
[03:45:19] actually might not even be enough if I
[03:45:20] don't do a CU you can't really do full
[03:45:22] rotations against these guys it's like
[03:45:23] multi-wave so it might not even be
[03:45:26] enough yeah we'll
[03:45:34] see you don't have hydro anyways
[03:45:39] dude honestly maybe okay but if you play
[03:45:42] BYU here then you literally Lally have
[03:45:45] no reason to run sieg win and I know
[03:45:47] that's your point but
[03:45:49] like okay listen wait let me look let me
[03:45:52] look we'll do this we'll do this then
[03:45:55] we'll do this one
[03:45:57] bloom two
[03:46:00] Bloom three Bloom four Bloom okay so the
[03:46:04] thing with her e at least is like
[03:46:06] there's effectively no ICD and AOE
[03:46:08] because each enemy has an independent
[03:46:10] ICD and it bounces between them so if I
[03:46:13] I blew I yeah five actually wait seven
[03:46:17] wait this might be a rare situation

[03:56:18] question sometimes you just
[03:56:22] do no think yes
[03:56:31] do all right we're
[03:56:37] done
[03:56:41] Mane I only got eight Stars that's
[03:56:43] [ __ ] crazy
[03:57:15] it's like I'm launching Google Chrome
[03:58:07] why did IO have to get power GP
[03:58:39] the [ __ ] is
[03:58:41] Neu where the [ __ ] is Neu
[03:58:51] I refuse to rank
[03:58:55] Candace Mona okay you don't want my take
[03:58:59] on Mona
[03:59:02] though I do iist I refuse to put Mona
[03:59:05] next to Ayo I do not think they're the
[03:59:07] same tier I'm
[03:59:11] sorry but I don't think I think
[03:59:21] yeah Mona clears AO yeah maybe if you
[03:59:24] own no other Hydro character freeze you
[03:59:26] play
[03:59:28] kokomi nuke DPS for a
[03:59:31] screenshot you play Mona Mona's okay but
[03:59:35] like
[03:59:45] does never let work as a better child
[03:59:47] okay
[03:59:48] sorry I just don't want to upset the
[03:59:50] child I honestly don't even want to rank
[03:59:52] child don't talk to me
[04:00:14] okay
[04:00:22] sorry no CH child International is still
[04:00:25] really
[04:00:27] good to be
[04:00:28] fair I'm kind of joking but like it is
[04:00:31] still really good just the versatility
[04:00:32] is not as high as AO I don't feel like
[04:00:35] explaining I'm just playing
[04:00:45] say was bad I think uh I think Chad's a
[04:00:48] good character but I don't think he's a
[04:00:50] good like pull does that make sense like
[04:00:52] I mean I like take my words of the grain
[04:00:55] of salt but like I think he's he's
[04:00:56] really strong at what he does but he's
[04:00:58] not as versatile like there's so many
[04:01:00] good versatile hydros that I wouldn't
[04:01:01] pull for him like if you have him he's
[04:01:03] good and you could use him in in like
[04:01:05] with Shang Ling and stuff but like if
[04:01:06] you don't have him I would choose a lot
[04:01:07] of other Hydro characters I was like for
[04:01:09] versatility even though his
[04:01:11] international team is like insane
[04:01:14] or you if you just want them right
[04:01:21] but like if nlet was not in the game Ayo
[04:01:24] would be here because he's incredibly
[04:01:25] versatile and pretty like he's the
[04:01:27] second best option in like every team
[04:01:28] ever the problem is now there's net so
[04:01:31] he's
[04:01:32] like yeah like that doesn't make him
[04:01:35] worse it's just
[04:01:37] like
[04:01:39] yeah yeah so I don't know like I could
[04:01:42] yeah
[04:01:52] Candace is weird cuz I think she's
[04:01:53] pretty good at C6 like like she can be
[04:01:55] played with nuu she can be played like
[04:01:57] maybe just a bit of offield high there's
[04:01:59] a team with uh arino as well like
[04:02:02] there's there's use cases for cace but
[04:02:04] it's depending on C6 so like
[04:02:11] yeah and then Mona I don't know I
[04:02:13] actually don't know how to feel about
[04:02:15] Mona I'm very like hydra's here I I
[04:02:18] don't know how to feel about
[04:02:22] Mona I've just never had a good
[04:02:24] experience playing
[04:02:25] her like it feels like the the the way
[04:02:28] she feels has always bothered me but
[04:02:30] like I don't that like I assume a lot of
[04:02:33] this is just personal preference but
[04:02:35] like even like meta wise like you're
[04:02:37] usually picking kookomi in your freeze
[04:02:38] team
[04:02:47] she's good if you don't have hydros like
[04:02:49] what's nice about her is like okay you
[04:02:51] don't have any like if you don't have
[04:02:53] kakomi you can run and you have Mona you
[04:02:55] don't need to pull for
[04:02:58] kakomi I don't
[04:03:00] know nuu over Ayo is crazy I'm an Ayo
[04:03:04] Doomer now I still think he's super
[04:03:06] versatile like I think again if nevet
[04:03:09] wasn't out he'd be right next to kakomi
[04:03:11] I just think now there's like no reason
[04:03:12] to recommend him he's like he's a good
[04:03:14] unit if you have him he's very versatile
[04:03:16] and like you might be like I hate NE uh
[04:03:18] nevet and that's fair but like if you're
[04:03:20] if you just care about like pull value I
[04:03:22] wouldn't put him out like he's still
[04:03:23] really versatile it's just like you have
[04:03:26] SRO you can pull
[04:03:28] nevet you recommend child not to
[04:03:35] pull but like you kind of have to give
[04:03:37] him his flowers because of how good his
[04:03:39] team
[04:03:40] is I mean like I want to do this but
[04:03:43] like I would get death threats if I did
[04:03:45] that so I and I haven't reflected upon
[04:03:47] this enough to have a educated
[04:03:52] opinion like if this is pull value he
[04:03:54] goes down if this is like meta wise he
[04:03:56] goes
[04:03:59] up anyways I don't want to talk about it
[04:04:02] I just wanted to put SE in here that's
[04:04:03] all that's the only reason I booted this
[04:04:05] up
[04:04:25] how's fin behind you I don't think
[04:04:27] they're ordered in the
[04:04:28] Tei tear aren't really ordered I don't
[04:04:31] think net
[04:04:33] is yeah no I think
[04:04:35] singo's it's probably
[04:04:38] like I actually don't know where I put
[04:04:40] nevet I think supports are too versatile
[04:04:42] but nevet breaks the game so I actually
[04:04:44] don't know where I would put
[04:04:47] him I don't know I don't have to think
[04:04:49] about
[04:04:52] it off the Dome though it's probably
[04:04:55] this like nevet is like stupid broken
[04:04:57] but like you might already have like so
[04:05:00] is like like arino is insane alyan's
[04:05:03] really good so I don't
[04:05:11] know yeah the the thing with genin is
[04:05:13] like supports are more valuable than
[04:05:15] DPSS but with nevet you don't even you
[04:05:17] don't even need supports dude he
[04:05:19] literally
[04:05:20] like [ __ ] pisses all over like
[04:05:23] everything including this Abyss is
[04:05:24] hydroch check which is it's weird cuz it
[04:05:27] Like It Breaks My Philosophy My
[04:05:29] Philosophy is like pull for supports DPS
[04:05:31] is pick who you want but net is just
[04:05:33] like [ __ ] you pick me and then you're
[04:05:36] like okay sorry sorry sorry and then you
[04:05:38] pick him and then he whips it out
[04:05:58] now okay well s made me sad um yeah we
[04:06:02] have to watch the side quest video
[04:06:03] that's true is there anything is there
[04:06:05] another is there anything else I want to
[04:06:07] do
[04:06:09] before Char's also amazing on second
[04:06:12] half yeah yes but like you wrot also
[04:06:15] wrote AO could never which means you're
[04:06:17] that type of chatter and AO definitely
[04:06:19] could like he can burst an e which is
[04:06:21] decent Hydro app and there's a bit of
[04:06:23] all field Hydro app which means and
[04:06:24] ios's teams usually run other forms of
[04:06:27] if it's not Hydro it's Electro which
[04:06:29] also breaks the shield so like I ha
[04:06:31] those teams are on actually I would
[04:06:33] argue unless you're somehow Hydro
[04:06:36] infused swirling your child your only
[04:06:39] Hydro app is your child's e and if you
[04:06:41] stay in it for too long as the hydro the
[04:06:42] double lectors you're going to have to
[04:06:44] kill the next wave of enemies with just
[04:06:45] strangling Kazo which is doable uh I
[04:06:48] mean I guess you could save your burst
[04:06:49] but the Ayo team is very like you're
[04:06:51] running a lot of like you you might run
[04:06:53] double Hydro you might not but even if
[04:06:54] you're not you're running a lot of [ __ ]
[04:06:56] that can like break the shields arguably
[04:06:58] faster than the child
[04:07:01] team you can charge attack okay but
[04:07:05] like
[04:07:08] okay yeah don't talk to me
[04:07:15] I will not stand for that IO slander I'm
[04:07:17] sorry all right let's watch this
[04:07:35] video then do it but don't use nlet on
[04:07:38] first half okay my toxic trait though is
[04:07:41] thinking that like in content like this
[04:07:43] net isn't even what I would use I would
[04:07:45] use alyam or [ __ ] like Shia like
[04:07:47] unironically I mean okay I guess that's
[04:07:48] not true I would net this but
[04:07:59] like all
[04:08:04] right you know what time it is chat okay
[04:08:07] let me conclude before I move on
[04:08:14] where the [ __ ] is
[04:08:16] ceden seden is okay I actually
[04:08:21] think sein is
[04:08:23] lowkey a uh Overworld character given
[04:08:26] how useful this passive is I feel like
[04:08:28] she's released as just like your comfy
[04:08:29] Comfort Overworld character for someone
[04:08:32] like me who cares about meta I would not
[04:08:33] pull for her uh is she usable yes she
[04:08:37] gives you her her skills healing in my
[04:08:39] opinion is good well not just in my
[04:08:41] opinion it is good uh because it's team
[04:08:44] wide it works with finina uh pretty well
[04:08:46] and the last big hit uh is for cedin
[04:08:49] herself but for the most part it's team
[04:08:50] wide healing and it it can stack clamor
[04:08:52] S A days past she gives you off field
[04:08:54] skill damage or skill damage to your off
[04:08:56] field character like Shen's quills it's
[04:08:58] good for someone like finina or Oz but
[04:09:00] what sucks about it is it doesn't work
[04:09:01] for like onfield skill users and it's
[04:09:03] not like that synergistic with it's
[04:09:06] basically just for like official or
[04:09:08] mainly finina she's mostly just a finina
[04:09:10] Healer now even in those teams in those
[04:09:13] there's some situations where she's
[04:09:14] pretty decent but there's others where
[04:09:16] you just rather have another healer uh
[04:09:18] like shenu and like [ __ ] Ki with like
[04:09:20] Amber Nita like prototype Amber Nita or
[04:09:23] like baiju or like Gan or whatever right
[04:09:25] or kookomi for onfield her Hydro
[04:09:27] application is complete dog [ __ ] her
[04:09:28] damage is complete dog [ __ ] what she
[04:09:31] gives you is team wide healing and
[04:09:33] basically zero field time you press e
[04:09:35] you swap out you get a buff from your
[04:09:36] set you get a buff from
[04:09:38] this would should you pull for that no
[04:09:40] but can you use it yes it's decent with
[04:09:43] finina is decent in
[04:09:44] freeze uh mostly double Hydro though but
[04:09:47] even just yeah and then you could just
[04:09:49] kind of flex in other teams but it's not
[04:09:50] in the other teams is more
[04:09:53] copium
[04:09:56] top on the I I give her two booms on the
[04:10:00] boom meter boom
[04:10:08] [Music]
[04:10:10] boom jet lag is the only thing that
[04:10:12] could EXP explains zionic streaming at
[04:10:14] zif hours anyways
[04:10:21] T that was 1.5 okay honestly I give her
[04:10:23] a 1.5 boom I don't think
[04:10:26] deserves I'm trying not to be a doom
[04:10:28] poster because like the reality is if
[04:10:30] you want a team white healer and you
[04:10:31] like her like she's pretty usable like
[04:10:33] it's not like there's teams where she's
[04:10:35] not bad it's just like her best case is
[04:10:38] like decent whereas most characters you
[04:10:40] pull for their best case is like amazing
[04:10:43] at least dude what the [ __ ] is this
[04:10:48] Dono 153 if you can take a look Dory
[04:10:51] have the ciret and Shen the Goblet
[04:10:53] please don't Dono wall me thank you I'm
[04:10:56] sorry this is the longest Dono since
[04:10:58] [ __ ] the the Magna
[04:11:05] Carta uh is it better an attack goblet
[04:11:08] or anemo goblet with finina I heard that
[04:11:10] fusa anemo
[04:11:13] it depends
[04:11:15] attack I'm going to say anemo cuz you're
[04:11:17] on Vermilion and you have a lot of
[04:11:20] attack Buffs if you're running a team in
[04:11:22] an artifact set that don't give you a
[04:11:24] lot of attack Buffs then attack percent
[04:11:26] can be
[04:11:27] better it
[04:11:32] depends but also something you need to
[04:11:34] note is Shan Yun benefits from damage
[04:11:36] percent crit all that stuff Buffs but
[04:11:39] not attack like her attack matters but
[04:11:42] the the way the like quills work work is
[04:11:43] it's the attack of Shan Yun and the
[04:11:46] Damage bonuses of
[04:11:48] your like sha or whoever your
[04:11:57] plunger sorry okay uh there's a video
[04:12:00] called cooking genin food this is by the
[04:12:04] way no it's not spoilers this in the
[04:12:06] video this is like half the video it's a
[04:12:08] two-part thing also I have to release uh
[04:12:12] like behind the scenes but I'm like the
[04:12:13] worst at recording [ __ ] it's going to be
[04:12:15] on the second channel so stay tuned for
[04:12:16] that at some point anyways I haven't
[04:12:18] watched it I know it says watch cuz I
[04:12:20] commented on it and I watched the first
[04:12:22] I skipped to where someone said I was
[04:12:23] balding but I didn't actually watch it
[04:12:25] in ffxx team it was fun to record though
[04:12:29] today we're going to be pulling and Jake
[04:12:30] told me he edited this one himself so it
[04:12:32] wasn't cringe but maybe it is cringe I
[04:12:33] mean inherently it might be a little but
[04:12:35] like hopefully it's not like you know
[04:12:37] apparently it's
[04:12:38] good I appreciate it
[04:12:43] I thought you could cook dude I can it's
[04:12:45] a good
[04:12:46] [Music]
[04:12:54] video just pulled on the weapon manner
[04:12:56] got a double five star the bow and the
[04:12:58] sword I'm very happy I got lucky because
[04:12:59] the weapon matter can be a
[04:13:02] nightmare that's really
[04:13:06] cool but nobody
[04:13:10] asked so [ __ ] you sorry sorry sorry I'm
[04:13:13] not typing that I'm just going to like
[04:13:15] it
[04:13:19] um yeah that's
[04:13:23] true honestly I should I should have
[04:13:25] mentioned that
[04:13:29] true
[04:13:33] true okay but like does he know like is
[04:13:38] it really okay this is going to sound
[04:13:40] toxic I'm sorry freom Ms but
[04:13:43] half of the reason why the weapon matter
[04:13:44] is bad is because Fin's weapons on it
[04:13:46] her weapon's not bad it's just like
[04:13:47] you'd rather have like key or Freedom
[04:13:49] sworn or mis spitter on your account or
[04:13:50] Jade like like I'm sorry but yeah like
[04:13:53] true what if Z was called freak

[04:18:41] like lighting and like look at my
[04:18:43] healthy roots in my hair it's healthy
[04:18:45] Roots what you guys are doing you're
[04:18:46] going to be paired into teams of two
[04:18:48] along with Doro and Jonathan whoever
[04:18:50] does worse has to pull for my chlorin
[04:18:52] and uh there might be that was my idea
[04:18:54] by the way W uh Zio saving the show
[04:18:57] there was going to be no chlorin PS and
[04:18:59] I was like dude people want to see pulls
[04:19:00] let's put pulls and they're like okay or
[04:19:02] something but that's like like who cares
[04:19:04] about that I don't want to pull for your
[04:19:05] chlorine or pay for it either we're not
[04:19:07] funding your chlorin also what the hell
[04:19:09] is on the punishment what of you guys is
[04:19:10] going to pay for my chlorin I don't know
[04:19:12] how to tell you sorry
[04:19:14] so what are we actually doing if you
[04:19:16] wrote this entire thing okay so here's
[04:19:19] what's going to happen you guys are
[04:19:20] going
[04:19:24] to welcome back to my show side quest my
[04:19:29] show my
[04:19:31] show my show your hair looked like Dash
[04:19:35] through it can we pretend he's not here
[04:19:37] yeah let's just 4.7 gen
[04:19:40] impact we got it this was also all not
[04:19:44] scripted by the way well okay the start
[04:19:45] was that's why was a little cringe but
[04:19:46] like the rest is like and way more
[04:19:48] importantly I was just yapping forent
[04:19:50] true I love clarent I didn't watch the
[04:19:53] video you got clarent yeah C6 that's
[04:19:55] seven clarent did you roll I got clarent
[04:19:59] she's really cool I think she's like has
[04:20:00] a one-of-a kit she like shoots and then
[04:20:03] dashes forward and you can kind of like
[04:20:04] Dodge abilities while dashing and you
[04:20:05] can play her in like a bunch of
[04:20:06] different teams well mostly just one but
[04:20:07] you can also play with like Chev if you
[04:20:09] want and she's mostly with dendro and
[04:20:10] then you can like build her different
[04:20:11] ways and did you know that like you
[04:20:13] could play her normally but if you equip
[04:20:14] like thundering Fury which is an electro
[04:20:16] artifact set her cool Down's reduced so
[04:20:18] you can actually do like different
[04:20:19] rotations they actually twice as long
[04:20:20] which is like more comfy because instead
[04:20:22] of having to like do this specific thing
[04:20:24] you can like kind of swap in and out of
[04:20:25] her so against multiwave content you
[04:20:27] know how Nita marks enemies so you have
[04:20:29] to swap from chlorin to Nita you don't
[04:20:31] have to do that anymore well you have to
[04:20:32] do that but it's annoying if you don't
[04:20:34] have the set but if you have the set you
[04:20:35] could just do it
[04:20:37] freely true
[04:20:42] that was just like your entire guide
[04:20:44] video I can keep going no it's okay I
[04:20:47] can keep going how do you say chlorin
[04:20:49] properly in French yeah cland I say it
[04:20:52] again cland do the first
[04:20:58] half oh that second part is so hard CLW
[04:21:03] cl cl cl no it's not that why why did
[04:21:06] you make me D I was thinking of like
[04:21:08] Turbo with a cl cl
[04:21:13] cl cl cl no it's not that why why did
[04:21:16] you make me do that this guy's trolling
[04:21:18] me cland cland close enough I would I
[04:21:22] would be like you tried good job and
[04:21:24] then move on I'd be like never say it
[04:21:26] was good but never say it again and then
[04:21:27] we move on feels so much no it wasn't
[04:21:29] bad it wasn't bad imaginary theater a
[04:21:32] new combat event also released which is
[04:21:35] really exciting they make us only use
[04:21:37] specific amount of elements which is
[04:21:39] interesting oh yeah D when you mentioned
[04:21:40] imaginary theater I was like I don't
[04:21:42] know
[04:21:43] if I want to go in on this or not dude I
[04:21:45] have like a six-page thesis on
[04:21:47] Imaginarium theater but like I don't
[04:21:50] know if I don't know yet it didn't
[04:21:54] release I think the it was supposed to
[04:21:56] be like uploaded after it was out Uncle
[04:21:59] Z I haven't played it I just know the
[04:22:01] official stuff a bit more time if I
[04:22:03] played it I could tell you I could be
[04:22:04] like look I played it we'll talk about
[04:22:06] when it's I didn't play it but like I
[04:22:07] mean we know what it
[04:22:10] is anyways for other characters to shine
[04:22:13] as well so people have to start building
[04:22:15] but this guy's build everyone so I've
[04:22:17] been building for years matter for him
[04:22:19] it varies from account to account but
[04:22:20] for me I'm a builder they call me Bob

[04:26:38] yeah you're wrong
[04:26:43] however we do still need an
[04:26:45] answer okay the first word is when you
[04:26:50] break up with someone and you get into
[04:26:53] another relationship right
[04:26:56] away uh
[04:26:58] rebound correct the second word skill is

[04:27:11] do do you did D lose to that you need to
[04:27:14] relax your muscles
[04:27:17] re or maybe when you're kind of sort of
[04:27:19] losing your mind because you lost the
[04:27:22] 50/50 rebound Hydro
[04:27:25] therapy correct oh my God rebound
[04:27:28] hydrotherapy is that actually what the
[04:27:30] [ __ ] it's called why is it so long oh it
