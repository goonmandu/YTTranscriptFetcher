[00:47:03] uh wait wait I need suspenseful
[00:47:08] music copyright free dramatic
[00:47:13] music honestly [ __ ] it even if there's
[00:47:16] copyright what is
[00:47:23] this this looks cringe but I'm going to
[00:47:25] play it
[00:47:28] why is low sodium sauce a thing okay
[00:47:31] real talk though it tastes a bit
[00:47:33] different for the first two times but
[00:47:34] then you get used to it and then it's
[00:47:35] just better cuz it's like you're not
[00:47:38] like [ __ ] salting your entire body
[00:48:02] true I like peanut butter with no added
[00:48:04] sugar or salt okay dude for the one year
[00:48:07] of my life where I was like healthy okay
[00:48:09] I I I started buying natural peanut
[00:48:11] butter okay don't get me wrong it's cool
[00:48:15] but like dude it's so much worse like
[00:48:17] okay for like smoothies I still use it
[00:48:19] if I'm making like a protein shake I'll
[00:48:21] still put normal peanut butter so I'm
[00:48:23] not getting [ __ ] like manufactured
[00:48:25] American Cancer but for like normal like
[00:48:27] when I like eat it just like with a
[00:48:29] spoon or on like toast dude the like
[00:48:31] craft peanut butter is so much better
[00:48:32] I'm sorry I'm actually sorry I'm
[00:48:34] actually sorry it tastes so much
[00:48:37] better but like I don't
[00:48:44] know I'm sorry bad take maybe it is I'm
[00:48:47] sorry but like also the peanut butter
[00:48:49] gets like the oil separation and then
[00:48:51] you got to like mix it in and then oil
[00:48:53] splashes on your hand and you got to
[00:48:54] like shake it and you get like a a a
[00:48:56] lump of oil and then [ __ ]
[00:49:00] [Applause]
[00:49:02] you just play okay okay wait wait
[00:49:06] wait the reason I looked up dramatic
[00:49:08] music and this doesn't even sound
[00:49:12] dramatic where is it where the [ __ ] is
[00:49:14] my
[00:49:18] tweet oh yeah this
[00:49:22] one okay I tweeted yo chat let me pause
[00:49:26] this this this is rooting my
[00:49:31] vibe
[00:49:33] um
[00:49:35] suspenseful
[00:49:37] music open
[00:49:41] Heimer
[00:49:46] [Music]
[00:49:49] sorry dude I tweeted okay I did stop
[00:49:52] typing Duality I tweeted uh yo how the
[00:49:54] [ __ ] is you know Shang Ling on the B
[00:49:56] instead of shelers right it's okay it
[00:49:58] happens it's a mistake put Shivers on
[00:50:00] Clarin Banner because we want Chevy for
[00:50:02] arino right we want her C6 we didn't get
[00:50:05] her no one has her C6 maybe chorin will
[00:50:07] use her I don't know if she will or not
[00:50:08] but you know just give me her on a
[00:50:09] banner so that's what I
[00:50:12] tweeted
[00:50:19] then this
[00:50:21] person tweeted uh replied Mr socks uh
[00:50:26] after like Chevy is a good fourstar he
[00:50:27] should have pulled more on her banner
[00:50:29] and then I tweeted I knew she was you
[00:50:31] know her she was pretty good like her C6
[00:50:33] was good was strong but I didn't want to
[00:50:34] spam pulls on a on a festar banner I
[00:50:36] didn't want now clarification here I
[00:50:38] didn't mean a five-star character I
[00:50:39] didn't want I didn't know which
[00:50:41] character I implied that the four stars
[00:50:43] were [ __ ] because I don't pull for five
[00:50:45] star constellations so what this could
[00:50:47] imply is two things first of all the
[00:50:49] five star character was either a rerun
[00:50:52] meaning I don't want another one because
[00:50:53] I already have them or the four stars
[00:50:56] are bad it doesn't mean the five-star
[00:50:58] character is necessarily bad or useless
[00:51:02] it just means that they're potentially a
[00:51:04] rerun and in this case it was yoia and
[00:51:09] now look I may have shot myself in the
[00:51:11] foot by by writing lmow
[00:51:14] o when with a picture of
[00:51:18] yoia
[00:51:19] look I I wasn't looking at her I was
[00:51:23] looking at the four stars now Chevy is
[00:51:25] is great but but Kudo Sara n support
[00:51:28] ready Hatter C6 Bennett broken but been
[00:51:31] out since [ __ ]
[00:51:33] 2022 I'm lying 2002 since [ __ ] the
[00:51:37] game came out so I have him C6 and so
[00:51:40] obviously and Y is a rerun right this
[00:51:42] could be [ __ ] kazua this could be
[00:51:45] Nita well Nita c2s this could
[00:51:50] be I'll hike them and I would Ste them
[00:51:52] foul because you know good character but
[00:51:55] I don't necessarily want to pull for
[00:51:58] constellations
[00:51:59] now
[00:52:01] um someone
[00:52:07] snitched someone
[00:52:11] snitched now I don't know who taught the
[00:52:13] uh my community to snitch because that's
[00:52:15] not what we teach around
[00:52:18] [Music]
[00:52:20] here Jenny what's he
[00:52:23] saying Emoji fearful face disappointed
[00:52:26] but relieved
[00:52:29] face and so I replied they said what are
[00:52:32] you trying to say Z I said oh hey how
[00:52:36] are you doing nice to see you here there
[00:52:38] seems to be a
[00:52:40] misunderstanding I'm actually not
[00:52:41] laughing at the presence of Yia a
[00:52:43] versatile five-star pyro bow wielding
[00:52:45] DPS from the nation of Yuma but instead
[00:52:47] at the other four-star characters I ran
[00:52:49] out of like a tweet limits here because
[00:52:51] I don't pay for Twitter blue uh SAR and
[00:52:54] Bennett what face is this smiling face
[00:52:57] with open mouth and smiling
[00:52:59] eyes then should have a picture I knew
[00:53:01] her C6 was strong but I didn't want to
[00:53:03] spend PS on a five star banner now again
[00:53:05] five star banner not about the five star
[00:53:07] character and then you know uh yeah this
[00:53:10] looks like I said caught but like I look
[00:53:12] okay but I don't actually pull for so
[00:53:14] all is well that ends well it's a simple
[00:53:17] misunderstanding no disrespect to
[00:53:19] Yia now where I may have taken it a
[00:53:22] little too far if we're being honest
[00:53:28] my experience with
[00:53:31] Zio where I may have taken it a little
[00:53:34] too
[00:53:35] far was
[00:53:38] um dude okay dude this tweet got quote
[00:53:42] retweeted getch in community what if I
[00:53:44] fight Zio what then 22k
[00:53:49] likes bro do you guys want it like what
[00:53:52] do you want what do you want from me
[00:53:56] then I
[00:53:57] replied with uh this gift that my
[00:54:00] Discord sent me I didn't make this uh I
[00:54:02] don't know where it's from this isn't my
[00:54:04] fault
[00:54:11] [Music]
[00:54:21] but okay but like no disrespect though
[00:54:24] like y Mia's cool but it
[00:54:31] anyways anyways so uh that that was the
[00:54:34] recap uh of the week that was the recap
[00:54:37] of the

[00:58:12] destroyed it easily so we progress in
[00:58:14] Golden gears usually I only do golden

[01:52:46] um I just started playing sag I said
[01:52:48] it's not your fault I'm sorry she's good
[01:52:50] though um
[01:52:52] what was that going to
[01:52:54] do oh yeah level
[01:52:59] her my boots are still plus
[01:53:02] three dude these are [ __ ] terrible
[01:53:04] boots though I kind of don't want to
[01:53:05] level them but I don't have a choice cuz
[01:53:07] I don't have better ones I probably have
[01:53:09] better ones but [ __ ] you
[01:53:29] break effect fact Robin
[01:53:35] sheesh bust
[01:53:40] sorry don't slack off even if it's not
[01:53:49] music only consistent practice can
[01:53:51] ensure Optimum
[01:54:08] performance oh level
[01:54:19] 70 don't slack off even if it's not
[01:54:21] music
[01:54:24] I can't even get
[01:54:37] this speeder attack boots
[01:54:48] attack guys do you want to hear my do
[01:54:50] you guys want to hear the Forbidden take
[01:54:51] this is like this is the fs crafter take
[01:54:54] so please mute the stream if you're a
[01:54:55] theory crafter mute the stream right now
[01:54:57] okay if you're like a if you're like a
[01:54:59] if you're like a if you're a TC mute the
[01:55:01] stream right now you want to hear my you
[01:55:02] want to hear my fields craf or take okay
[01:55:04] you know how like attack sphere is
[01:55:06] usually well you might not know but fun
[01:55:07] fact attack sphere is usually a bit
[01:55:08] better than physical sphere on Robin
[01:55:10] that's usually you usually go attack
[01:55:11] okay the feels fully feels crafter take
[01:55:15] right now since Robin can't use like any
[01:55:17] substat in the [ __ ] game and none of
[01:55:19] them matter other than attack wouldn't
[01:55:21] it be technically optimal to go a
[01:55:22] physical ball with like turbo attack
[01:55:24] subat and then just get like a 20%
[01:55:26] attack for free on top of a physical
[01:55:27] ball instead of attack with like no subs
[01:55:30] Fields crafter okay anyways my fault my
[01:55:33] fault my
[01:55:41] fault it's hard yeah yeah obviously you
[01:55:43] know it's not easy to farm I get that
[01:55:46] but I'm just
[01:55:48] saying I was like looking into her a bit
[01:55:50] cuz I was going to make a robin guide
[01:55:51] but then I was like oh [ __ ] there's the
[01:55:53] [ __ ] Early Access stuff and then
[01:55:55] every a robin video is like 20 days
[01:55:56] early and I was like oh I forgot so then
[01:55:58] I just didn't post a robin video but I
[01:55:59] will post a booill video so you know
[01:56:02] cool wow booill I mean I like booill
[01:56:11] so dude I got to stop talking I'm
[01:56:16] sorry you mean bootleg
[01:56:27] have you seen booill theme how would I
[01:56:28] see that is it
[01:56:30] out
[01:56:45] sus to be fair it's real to be fair I've
[01:56:49] heard um okay I'm about to expose I'm
[01:56:53] about to expose someone real quick I I
[01:56:55] for the past like month I've heard Fang
[01:56:57] Loop Robin's [ __ ] song non stop so I
[01:57:00] was like already annoyed of it before
[01:57:02] she came out it's not a bad song shout
[01:57:04] out Robin good song I didn't mean to go
[01:57:06] here but like I've literally heard it
[01:57:08] like maybe [ __ ] 70
[01:57:13] times it's been like stuck in my
[01:57:16] head now I have to hear it every game
[01:57:18] every [ __ ] battle I do
[01:57:21] [Music]
[01:57:27] what am I doing like can I just [ __ ]
[01:57:29] stop getting dude what am I doing I'm
[01:57:33] sorry is mono physic stop playing mono
[01:57:36] teams man like like like like just seek
[01:57:39] Jesus please
[01:57:42] please this there's no this is not the
[01:57:45] silver wolf is not kadara kazua brother
[01:57:48] you can play mono if you want it can
[01:57:50] work but I just just just like
[01:57:59] like I usually recommend flexing your
[01:58:01] team composition based on enemy
[01:58:03] weaknesses and what is more valuable to
[01:58:07] you
[01:58:08] liquidation watch your
[01:58:19] head having multiple characters in this
[01:58:21] game feels feels even more useful than
[01:58:23] inchin because it's like yeah you can
[01:58:26] play the same two teams everywhere but
[01:58:28] you can kind of like if you have two
[01:58:30] Support options and two like healer
[01:58:31] options you can kind of flex based on
[01:58:33] weakness a bit more like I'm not
[01:58:36] benching my Bennett for cocomi cuz the
[01:58:38] enem is like water weak
[01:58:45] and uh go
[01:58:53] go

[02:01:15] of leave it there so that it's not war
[02:01:17] like it's not warm anymore but it's not
[02:01:20] like cold it's not cold enough to
[02:01:22] complain but it's like a weird awkward
[02:01:23] room temperature a little hot to where
[02:01:25] you're uncomfortable you're like a bit
[02:01:27] annoyed eating here like damn I wish
[02:01:28] this was warmer but it's not too bad to
[02:01:30] where you're complaining you're just
[02:01:31] kind of going to be there and be like
[02:01:32] damn I you know what I really wish that

[02:01:44] liquid but congrats on your uh on your
[02:01:46] lucky p
[02:02:02] cut let us connect
[02:02:04] Spotify yo imagine you connect Spotify
[02:02:07] to Robin she starts
[02:02:12] rapping
[02:02:17] me she did that would be that would be
[02:02:20] sick I I think Jake was actually telling
[02:02:23] me like off stream he was like dude we
[02:02:25] should um jelking session no he didn't
[02:02:28] say that I'm sorry he did teach me the
[02:02:30] word jelking anyways I got to stop say
[02:02:32] okay he that's not what don't clip this
[02:02:34] okay I'm actually being serious though
[02:02:35] he said like it'd be cool if Robin you
[02:02:37] could like choose one of her songs for
[02:02:39] her alt or you Shuffle cuz Robin has
[02:02:41] like an album Remember there like a star
[02:02:42] rail album he's like you should be able
[02:02:45] to like choose a song that Robin sings
[02:02:47] or Shuffle it I think that's true I
[02:02:48] think she absolutely should be able to
[02:02:50] like cycle cuz she has multiple songs
[02:02:52] [Music]
[02:02:53] Harmony
[02:03:00] and yeah she has an I think so I don't
[02:03:02] know if it's out but I heard them say on
[02:03:04] like the star rail like stream
[02:03:10] thing copium they won't do it bro this
[02:03:13] is star rail not genin they might do it
[02:03:15] you don't have to [ __ ] type copium

[02:14:53] him memory imprint did that apply a
[02:14:55] debuff memory
[02:14:59] imprint Harmony
[02:15:03] and SAS knowledge the measure of Tru
[02:15:11] and zero
[02:15:19] point and then that gives a debuff cuz
[02:15:21] of the
[02:15:33] trend it's on me
[02:15:38] [ __ ] that's kind of watch your
[02:15:41] head the dice have been cast Okay I want

[02:16:53] debuffs okay calm down
[02:16:56] buddy okay so proof of dead is one uh
[02:17:00] I'm just going to basic memory imprint
[02:17:02] that's theoc right so that's no there's
[02:17:04] no debuff there then here there's a
[02:17:06] follow
[02:17:09] up then I'm going to e here 80% all
[02:17:15] good that applied
[02:17:23] effect res
[02:17:25] reduction so two only which is not
[02:17:30] great I don't need the skill cuz Pro

[02:19:44] have another
[02:19:47] one so two
[02:19:53] plus one three plus two five well one
[02:19:57] but like there's also the lon so
[02:19:58] technically two so like we have like
[02:20:00] five debuffs which is enough for for for
[02:20:02] Doctor Strange uh because you know you
[02:20:04] just don't cap out one of his like crit
[02:20:06] things but like who
[02:20:07] cares it's just kind of inconsistent cuz
[02:20:10] you need to alt on two characters that
[02:20:11] don't really like they don't get their
[02:20:13] alts every turn
[02:20:15] but and like what if you're swapping
[02:20:17] targets but there are like other debuffs
[02:20:19] you can get like break Shields and Mock
[02:20:21] and [ __ ] so I think it's fine I think we
[02:20:24] can actually start playing her I it's
[02:20:31] fine did I just do eight damage I just
[02:20:34] saw an
[02:20:37] eight yo Rez why do you want me to E1 S1
[02:20:40] my topaz so
[02:20:42] bad he said oh since your do team is
[02:20:45] free to play you might as well make your
[02:20:47] uh followup attack team whale
[02:20:55] in victory means playing the game means
[02:20:58] playing
[02:21:00] the she sounds like [ __ ] Mickey Mouse
[02:21:03] notice like that's not a bad thing I'm
[02:21:04] just like you know Mickey Mouse like
[02:21:06] like his voice like kind of
[02:21:08] like toas kind of does that
[02:21:11] too capital D colon that's not a bad
[02:21:14] thing topaz is
[02:21:17] cool I like Mickey Mouse
[02:21:23] imagine liking topaz okay take that back
[02:21:25] topaz slander will not be
[02:21:29] tolerated

[02:21:34] goat if topaz a numy are drowning and
[02:21:37] you can only save one who are you
[02:21:45] saving should probably level these hunt

[02:21:57] 3% damage 2% crit
[02:22:03] damage
[02:22:17] okay she'd want me to save Nami true
[02:22:19] actually wait am I supposed to pronounce
[02:22:21] the b is it num

[02:22:36] game chat what if I do something that

[02:23:42] level a character to like 90 and genin I
[02:23:44] get like plus4 attack my attack is going
[02:23:46] up by
[02:23:47] 100 what the freak
[02:23:51] I guess it's because of the like
[02:23:52] percentage things
[02:23:58] but attack percent wait I'm actually
[02:24:00] pretty close
[02:24:30] all right we're keeping her at 79 [ __ ]
[02:24:32] it we're never getting that
[02:24:40] Trace oh

[02:25:02] fault
[02:25:04] here turn off the ads I literally don't

[02:35:46] kind of want to okay the problem here
[02:35:48] chat is that uh I can't put trend on
[02:35:51] both of my
[02:35:52] characters okay there's some people who
[02:35:55] are [ __ ] meshing cogs salesmen
[02:35:57] there's some people who are [ __ ] the
[02:35:59] the the the the fonia salesmen I'm going
[02:36:02] to say it I'm going to [ __ ] say it
[02:36:05] I'm a [ __ ] Trend salesman I don't
[02:36:07] care I'm a trend salesman this [ __ ]
[02:36:08] lyone is it's better than my life I need
[02:36:12] it on both of them
[02:36:14] man cuz like acon needs debuffs and top
[02:36:17] uh ratio needs debuffs
[02:36:21] how's paila pronounced it's probably
[02:36:22] Pella or like Pala or some [ __ ] but I
[02:36:24] say paila cuz I'm
[02:36:33] stupid all right we're doing memory of
[02:36:35] chaos with uh let's let me show you guys
[02:36:37] my builds we're doing a robin team okay
[02:36:38] we're doing a full-up attack team now
[02:36:40] keep in mind our debuff amounts are a
[02:36:41] little bit lower than uh the norm with
[02:36:44] ratio cuz we don't have like E1 S1 stuff
[02:36:46] like that but it is what it is I think
[02:36:48] we have like five I counted plus
[02:36:50] whatever like I think memory chaos gives
[02:36:51] one and like enemies breaking and [ __ ]
[02:36:54] uh we're running aventurine on on okay
[02:36:56] okay Robin we're on not her signature
[02:36:58] we're on the the BR lone we got this
[02:37:00] from standard
[02:37:01] Banner I'm on uh level 9ish talents is I
[02:37:05] say is right uh ezero of course honestly
[02:37:09] very mediocre relics we're on two piece
[02:37:11] two piece with ageless 120 speed 4K
[02:37:14] attack which is a good amount uh and
[02:37:16] that's it that's all we're caring about
[02:37:17] okay okay pretty average
[02:37:20] Robin oh cool give her a
[02:37:24] star uh let me give this to
[02:37:27] Blade
[02:37:30] Sparkle acon okay um and then we're
[02:37:34] running ratio topaz topaz is on free to
[02:37:36] play
[02:37:36] LOD um these are the talents these are
[02:37:39] the relics not like you know not to
[02:37:41] Turbo optimized but good enough we're
[02:37:43] not like this isn't like my main team so
[02:37:45] it's not like turbo optimal but it's
[02:37:47] good enough sub stats and stuff like
[02:37:48] pretty good ratio get more crit damage
[02:37:50] from our set and [ __ ] and our uh Trace
[02:37:53] Talent whatever it's called I'm on
[02:37:55] Pioneer uh and then a bunch of just
[02:37:57] defense for adventur okay
[02:38:01] okay oh
[02:38:03] also for no not who was I going to say
[02:38:11] um okay that's enough Mari include that
[02:38:13] if you if you make this a video but what
[02:38:14] I want to say to chat right now is um
[02:38:17] look at what we just rolled
[02:38:22] you could never you could never
[02:38:27] you you could
[02:38:32] never I spoke with some
[02:38:35] um genin creators I spoke to some star
[02:38:38] rail
[02:38:39] creators and you know what I found out I
[02:38:41] found out that like literally all of
[02:38:43] them or not a single one of the people I
[02:38:45] was talking to had a 50 crit value genin
[02:38:49] artifact and I got one in 2020 now you
[02:38:53] might be like oh but that's just Luxo
[02:38:55] but me personally I would say it's a
[02:38:56] form of skill expression and it's like
[02:38:58] I'm the chosen one that's what I would
[02:39:00] say that's what I would
[02:39:05] say hey Z when you get a moment check
[02:39:08] out Robin Tech it sounds like barbar
[02:39:10] Elemental skin what's Robin
[02:39:13] tech oh technique I thought dude I'm
[02:39:16] like such a [ __ ] I have like Smash
[02:39:18] Bros in my in my origin story so when I

[02:39:26] cool new
[02:39:27] tech all right let's do uh okay also

[02:39:34] pretty single Target but it's fine let's
[02:39:36] do it oh my topaz sorry wait what does

[03:05:29] keep it a150 I mean okay realistically
[03:05:32] it's probably better to just bench blade
[03:05:33] and then put like sparkle here or or
[03:05:36] brono but like I kind of don't want to
[03:05:37] do
[03:05:45] that I kind of don't want to bench blade

[03:21:50] matters though cam
[03:21:54] fix
[03:21:59] okay play Sparkle with May that would
[03:22:02] give us more break but less turns so I
[03:22:03] don't know if
[03:22:05] it actually would be better
[03:22:07] maybe we also kind of need the skill
[03:22:09] points no I mean rme is positive like

[03:26:51] this isn't good but like but
[03:26:53] like [ __ ]

[03:27:01] piece of all time never mind it's
[03:27:03] redeemed it's not good but like it is
[03:27:05] what it
[03:27:07] is I don't even

[03:27:52] light pack okay we're actually fine
[03:27:54] we're actually fine boom boom Oh wa this
[03:27:58] is not really fine but like it's okay
[03:28:00] 151 speed kind of not really good but
[03:28:02] kind of it is what it is cuz we're zero
[03:28:04] we're [ __ ] zero cycling surely so
[03:28:06] like it doesn't matter
[03:28:18] fall of an Aon welth dude shut the [ __ ]
[03:28:20] up you're not supposed to see
[03:28:25] that wait I actually don't know wait
[03:28:27] which technique should I use here with p
[03:28:29] pilas is better is silver Wolf's worth
[03:28:32] okay it's worth if I hit it from here
[03:28:34] 100% [ __ ]
[03:28:39] it trickier to
[03:28:41] crack time for a
[03:28:48] I wish my wealth went before my
[03:28:50] Sparky for Oblivion yeah I call her
[03:28:53] Sparky we're we're cool like that oh I
[03:28:55] should have broke that
[03:29:06] guy okay there is an optimal order of
[03:29:09] actions here this combat needs up this
[03:29:12] is double
[03:29:13] speed I still don't overcap then I do
[03:29:17] this cuz I don't want to apply a crimson
[03:29:19] knot here wait do I cuz I could ult
[03:29:21] first if I want to no no no I do this
[03:29:23] first for sure and then I do this oh I
[03:29:25] could have [ __ ] Sparkle aled no I
[03:29:28] wait for the depart [ __ ] it's fine it's
[03:29:30] fine minus whatever buff it gives you
[03:29:32] it's fine I should have sparkle aled but
[03:29:34] this is still good this is still good
[03:29:35] this is still
[03:29:36] good I the only thing I missed was
[03:29:38] Sparkle Al but it doesn't matter it
[03:29:39] doesn't matter
[03:29:42] Cipher this is still good we're still
[03:29:43] going to we're still going to get it no
[03:29:46] we're not I mean we still can clear
[03:29:48] we're healthy as
[03:29:52] [ __ ] okay we can wait I have an idea
[03:29:56] okay chat re level with me here do you
[03:30:05] think do you think if I start with this
[03:30:07] guy broken I can kill both at the same
[03:30:09] time cuz he's going to be weak probably
[03:30:11] not I think we need to Al twice anyways
[03:30:13] finish this
[03:30:16] so I think it's only doable if like if
[03:30:17] like yeah when are we going to do story

[03:52:28] counter I'm going to lra skill just to
[03:52:30] get a a stack and I don't want my Robin
[03:52:33] to die cuz then you guys are going to
[03:52:34] type Lua kek W uh let me skill on
[03:52:40] her good damage okay she's dead honestly
[03:52:43] it's better to focus her just to avoid
[03:52:44] any risk of dying there's literally no
[03:52:46] way we die now unless my Lua gets one
[03:52:47] shot right here right now emerge but
[03:52:48] that's not going to
[03:52:51] happen we're fine support

[03:53:22] uh Pella can Al here and break all their
[03:53:23] Shields out I'm not really afraid of
[03:53:25] getting taking damage and here we get
[03:53:26] healed we're fine we're
[03:53:29] fine I can peel out if I need I think
[03:53:31] I'm going
[03:53:33] to us
[03:53:38] yeah it's going to delay their action so
[03:53:40] I don't [ __ ]
[03:53:43] die the only way I die here is if he
[03:53:45] sometime somehow does two five four six
[03:53:48] damage on my Robin That's not GNA happen
[03:53:49] should I skill forther energy I can
[03:53:52] afford to actually I can I think I can I
[03:53:55] think I can I think I can we're going to
[03:53:56] do
[03:53:59] it I
[03:54:05] underestimated unworthy

[03:54:16] lunar flame I'm hungry please win I'd
[03:54:18] win no I'd win watch
[03:54:21] this surely I don't need to P Al
[03:54:27] right he's already exposed which means P
[03:54:29] Al is already applied
[03:54:31] so I think I think that's what exposed
[03:54:36] is not good can you die please can you
[03:54:39] can you uh can you die I hope for an end
[03:54:42] to stri can you

[03:54:51] just for this I mean maybe I should how
[03:54:53] much HP does he have man I could lual so

[03:55:33] energy true boom ready for death uh yeah
[03:55:36] I'm going to Robin all okay oh my God
[03:55:38] this is beautiful this is literally
[03:55:39] perfect case scenario watch this um
[03:55:47] is there a benefit to alting or pressing
[03:55:48] something here I don't actually does it
[03:55:50] even affect anything at all I don't
[03:55:52] think it matters right I could get a
[03:55:53] free skill point no but then
[03:55:56] my does it even matter if I use
[03:56:07] anything well I'm trying to think basic
[03:56:11] I mean energy
[03:56:15] yeah I mean yeah but he's not going to
[03:56:19] like he doesn't teleport us does he
[03:56:20] teleport us to the dice right now let me
[03:56:24] see let me see does he dice TPS right
[03:56:26] now or is that the next hit yeah it's
[03:56:29] the next one so I'm probably Robin
[03:56:31] alting here for the support
[03:56:54] yeah I think we Robin Al tier I could be
[03:56:56] wrong but I'm pretty sure this is worth
[03:56:57] it cuz we break them we do this then
[03:56:59] Jing and then Robin gets her alt it
[03:57:00] doesn't matter if I lost energy like I
[03:57:02] get it here I think unless I'm
[03:57:05] yeah p and then we go again again enemy
[03:57:11] detected I'm going to try to get energy
[03:57:12] though so that if I get in the dice face
[03:57:14] I can all
[03:57:18] stuff I don't have my lra field out I'll
[03:57:21] Al if I need to but I think I'm
[03:57:23] fine
[03:57:28] [Music]
[03:57:36] oh I'm not going to use it cuz he's
[03:57:38] about to dice
[03:57:40] someone he's about to dice us all will
[03:57:43] be revealed
[03:57:45] okay
[03:57:47] okay I did I did two
[03:57:51] damage I did two
[03:57:54] damage all
[03:57:57] right it's
[03:57:59] easy four it's the AOE oh my dude dude
[03:58:04] like this isn't my fault return you guys
[03:58:07] are like oh oh it's a skill issue but

[03:58:19] AOE ready for another I'm healing her

[03:58:34] sorry receive Divinity save it for your
[03:58:37] own
[03:58:41] skin leave it for your own skin yeah I
[03:58:43] probably should have PE outed I don't
[03:58:45] know why I greeted
[03:58:49] it I was like maybe he'll like trap Pea
[03:58:51] in the dice game but I forgot that phze
[03:58:53] wasn't the dice game one
[03:59:00] bomom kind of want to delay his action
[03:59:02] but [ __ ] it many energy is
[03:59:07] energy 1% 1%
[03:59:14] well surely we hit a
[03:59:18] four we hit a
[03:59:22] two I hit a
[03:59:24] two I hit a
[03:59:29] [Music]
[03:59:31] two okay do I let my ego take over and I
[03:59:34] don't heal my Pila because I would have
[03:59:36] to basic attack on jinglu it do I let my
[03:59:39] ego take over and then I probably
[03:59:42] lose oh oh my God I'm going to have to
[03:59:45] basic uning
[03:59:54] theu
[03:59:55] actually wait I feel like my Fields
[03:59:58] going to heal enough I feel like I'm
[04:00:00] going to heal enough yeah passive yeah
[04:00:03] yeah and then field yeah yeah I knew it
[04:00:05] although I thought I didn't know if the
[04:00:06] passive was going to proc instantly but
[04:00:07] okay it's too easy it's just too easy
[04:00:09] and we saved the skill point it's
[04:00:10] [ __ ] it's just like that it's just
[04:00:12] that simple
[04:00:14] welcome to

[04:00:51] don't talk to me I can actually break I
[04:00:52] can break it doesn't matter I'm only

[04:00:59] where this worth this actually worth
[04:01:00] this actually worth look look see he's
[04:01:01] broken
[04:01:04] watch never mind I'm
[04:01:08] terrible honestly that was good damage
[04:01:10] though I think it's worth it unless we
[04:01:11] literally die here it's probably worth
[04:01:13] He also just the five which is
[04:01:18] lucky three I'll see you
[04:01:25] off four Nowhere to
[04:01:31] Run what my jingl got a five on three
[04:01:35] die it's fine I mean it's fine it does
[04:01:39] doesn't matter for the support enemy it

[04:23:25] Montana collab with Robin
[04:23:30] thoughts welcome to my whoo oh

[04:24:10] true tip your delivery person oh Gage
[04:24:14] all right
[04:24:17] cool bro that's Aon not yogurt drink
[04:24:20] okay but like they advertise it as
[04:24:22] yogurt drink anyways I'm about to get
[04:24:24] attack percent get [ __ ] loser effect
[04:24:26] hit rate honestly I could use this on
[04:24:28] silver wolf this is actually the piece
[04:24:30] of all time watch this only rolls crit
[04:24:33] it's a crit day today's a crit
[04:24:39] day okay
[04:24:44] okay
[04:24:48] [ __ ]
[04:24:50] well I'm already less motivated to
[04:24:52] finish leveling this piece but it's
[04:24:54] still you know one one bad roll doesn't
[04:24:56] uh you know it's this is still good one
[04:24:59] more crit roll and I'm [ __ ] pogging
[04:25:01] one more crit roll and I'm [ __ ]
[04:25:02] pogging my jingl does not need speed but
[04:25:05] um she does if I change my rope and I
[04:25:08] probably will change my rope so any of
[04:25:10] the first three stats are good crit
[04:25:11] would be the best best we got crit rate
[04:25:14] yo that's good this is insane that's
[04:25:17] really good POG and our Jing actually
[04:25:20] needs a bit of crit rate so that's like
[04:25:22] Optimal cuz right now a little bit low
[04:25:24] on the crit rate we go here 22 crit
[04:25:27] damage oh wait this is also really good
[04:25:29] wait wait
[04:25:33] um oh [ __ ] this is better wait this is
[04:25:36] more rolls oh [ __ ]
[04:25:45] well uh who the [ __ ] wait who else am I
[04:25:48] using Quantum
[04:25:52] cely all right we got a cely piece cely
[04:25:56] un benched
[04:26:00] soon crit better than attack by a big
[04:26:02] margin yeah sure but like first of all
[04:26:04] attack still fine and second of all uh
[04:26:06] uh uh uh look at the difference it's
[04:26:09] four crit rolls versus three so the crit
[04:26:11] value
[04:26:15] we'll see though we'll see I mean I
[04:26:17] guess for now the crit rate is better
[04:26:20] but

[04:36:18] stream
[04:36:20] four all right okay 2.1 a friend my
[04:36:25] experi are much better than yours when I
[04:36:28] first saw this technically we're doing
[04:36:30] this Quest on patch day so like we're
[04:36:33] technically all time your eyes aren't
[04:36:34] deceiving you it's her the famous singer
[04:36:39] oh also recap of what we saw before this
[04:36:42] started uh [ __ ] the Firefly incident
[04:36:44] meme just pulled through and also Robin
[04:36:47] randomly [ __ ]
[04:36:50] deedge or is
[04:36:53] she I don't have a soundboard or I would
[04:36:56] okay but how is that possible how is
[04:36:59] that
[04:37:04] Robin well first of all can I just say
[04:37:07] that this had nothing to do with me I'm
[04:37:09] just an unlucky bystander here here the
[04:37:12] family can testify for me if you don't
[04:37:15] believe me just ask anyone in the BL I
[04:37:17] don't trust the family they hate me and
[04:37:19] they hate the IPC I don't even trust
[04:37:21] Misha so they' never
[04:37:25] lie this is not where the crime happened
[04:37:28] what I showed you was a memory the most
[04:37:31] basic L cone manting Tech authorized by
[04:37:34] The Garden of recollection and owned by
[04:37:36] the
[04:37:38] IPC did you really think the Galaxy
[04:37:41] Ranger was an outsider this whole
[04:37:45] time penacon has made a solemn
[04:37:48] commitment to protect the safety of
[04:37:50] anyone inside a family dream any person
[04:37:53] in distress will be forcibly awakened
[04:37:55] and safely returned to
[04:37:57] reality okay protect the safety of
[04:38:00] anyone what gives them the confidence to
[04:38:02] make such conclusive statements because
[04:38:05] behind this promise is the
[04:38:07] harmony the family's dreamweavers link
[04:38:10] up their minds to together to construct
[04:38:12] an unbreakable defensive
[04:38:16] line breaking through this line of
[04:38:18] defense to create death in the
[04:38:22] Dreamscape not even a memo keeper could
[04:38:24] do that without the family's permission
[04:38:27] okay who could have done it friend the
[04:38:31] only one is her the girl who calls
[04:38:34] herself a galaxy
[04:38:36] ranger an impostor impostor unsought
[04:38:40] guest sorry an emanator who hides her
[04:38:43] true identity
[04:38:46] acaron we've played other games bro we
[04:38:48] know she's foregone
[04:38:50] conclusion and
[04:38:53] Robin her Misfortune was staring right
[04:38:55] at
[04:38:57] her who will be the next to
[04:39:01] die that really is hard to take
[04:39:06] in Chad I just launch launched AFK
[04:39:09] Journey on my phone building trust
[04:39:12] always takes time and I'm willing to
[04:39:15] wait
[04:39:22] thought I just hope you realize that
[04:39:25] that Legacy is
[04:39:27] concerned covert plans are already
[04:39:30] underway throughout
[04:39:32] paniconi everyone's got their own agenda
[04:39:37] okay careful you don't get stuck on the
[04:39:40] wrong side
[04:39:42] if I were you I'd keep my distance from
[04:39:45] acaron after all any schemes out in the
[04:39:49] open are always going to be better than
[04:39:50] a monster Monster In the Shadows right
[04:39:54] she is a monster in the shadows who's to
[04:39:57] say there isn't an even deeper
[04:39:58] conspiracy lurking beneath the
[04:40:03] surface hello boxan memo keeper I think
[04:40:07] our little deal is finished
[04:40:12] aventurine is telling the truth this
[04:40:15] memory is a real one and there's no sign
[04:40:18] of any Distortion grafting on if I click
[04:40:21] on her hand when I when when like to for
[04:40:23] it it's like we're holding hands you see
[04:40:25] is not the garden I'm sorry there are
[04:40:27] real limits to what they can actually do
[04:40:29] okay but you know all
[04:40:32] this friend let's not beat around the
[04:40:34] bush here the thing is I want to reach
[04:40:37] out personally to team up than fore
[04:40:41] team up with the astral Express I told
[04:40:44] you I'm just not interested in
[04:40:45] scrambling for the
[04:40:47] Legacy I just you know I like you
[04:40:49] adventuring but I don't know if I trust
[04:40:51] you like
[04:40:52] that I'm going keep it real catch my
[04:40:56] drift I'm talking ownership of this
[04:40:58] Frontier
[04:41:00] prison oh also I heard the line where he
[04:41:02] was like doctor you're so big I heard
[04:41:05] that line I actually heard it that's
[04:41:06] like one of the only other things I
[04:41:07] heard this has all become a bad debt
[04:41:10] thanks to the cancer of all he literally
[04:41:12] says that you'll see you'll see see IPC
[04:41:14] has tried sitting down for negotiations
[04:41:16] time and again but the family wouldn't
[04:41:19] our calls okay you have no idea how
[04:41:23] difficult these people are to deal with
[04:41:26] put it this way they've hushed up the
[04:41:28] existence of death before okay so they
[04:41:31] can definitely cover up any news about
[04:41:33] Robin what if Robin's not actually dead
[04:41:35] and it was all a dream just quietly Flo
[04:41:38] and then we wake up bubble and pop
[04:41:42] nobody ever been the wiser that's not
[04:41:45] fair right so then friend I need your
[04:41:51] help I can't trust
[04:41:54] you I have but only one goal the
[04:41:58] family's front door is like a high wall
[04:42:00] and to tear the whole thing down I'll
[04:42:02] have to dig out a few chunks
[04:42:04] First Once I find a weak point the IPC
[04:42:08] will have plenty of means [ __ ] it I
[04:42:10] trust you now we have a chance so long
[04:42:13] as we can get to the truth behind her
[04:42:15] death we can have Justice for
[04:42:17] Robin also let me mute
[04:42:20] alerts Casta I appreciate you think so
[04:42:22] Prime guys I have a theory okay tell me
[04:42:24] if this is a okay okay here's my theory
[04:42:26] do you think they put uh words in bold
[04:42:29] in this game cuz there's no Pimon to
[04:42:31] like reread the important part to idiots
[04:42:33] like they make genin idiot proof by
[04:42:35] having Pon repeat the important [ __ ] to
[04:42:36] you here do they just B is it just
[04:42:39] bolded they're like listen here dumbass
[04:42:42] get to the truth behind her
[04:42:45] death truly a once in a blue moon
[04:42:49] opportunity I've been investigating and
[04:42:51] making lots of friends all over pentacon
[04:42:53] precisely for this very moment okay this
[04:42:58] tragic news would be extremely bad for
[04:43:00] the family this guy's a sociopath that's
[04:43:02] the vibe I'm getting stop it leaking
[04:43:04] especially to the IPC but I trust them
[04:43:06] with my life I trust that there are
[04:43:08] still a few factions that remain
[04:43:10] exceptions
[04:43:11] and that's why I need you
[04:43:13] all the reputation of the astral Express
[04:43:16] precedes you and the harmony will give
[04:43:19] you the fairest of
[04:43:22] appraisals or like a I don't know what
[04:43:24] the word is like like a really what
[04:43:26] happen or you like use people and I get
[04:43:30] to put it toward completing my mission
[04:43:31] for the IPC it's what you call a win-win
[04:43:37] situation okay do you want to take
[04:43:39] advantage of the family's trust in US
[04:43:43] don't worry just head back and talk
[04:43:44] things over with your companions that
[04:43:46] Navigator is really smart she must
[04:43:50] understand the value of this deal look
[04:43:53] here's my contact details if you come to
[04:43:56] any conclusions call me hey you don't
[04:43:59] have to tell me twice take this a
[04:44:02] thorough investigation can always use a
[04:44:04] little more funding and he gave us
[04:44:08] money this guy's actually [ __ ] child
[04:44:10] too I really am looking forward to
[04:44:12] uncovering the truth about death with
[04:44:16] everyone cool [ __ ] money just
[04:44:19] sauntered off he really doesn't mean to
[04:44:22] force it but something still seems off
[04:44:26] what now what are your
[04:44:29] plans oh she's still here what is she
[04:44:35] thinking the
[04:44:37] [ __ ] I just got 50k credits
[04:44:41] wait he actually just gave us
[04:44:46] money on the surface this doesn't look
[04:44:48] like a bad deal for you but a venturine
[04:44:52] is a shrewd Merchant whose scheme won't
[04:44:55] just be as simple as it appears to be he
[04:44:58] doesn't know about Miss Firefly yet but
[04:45:01] judging by your reaction he may have
[04:45:03] noticed something going on and
[04:45:06] deliberately shifted topics to the truth
[04:45:08] of death to try and pull you okay I
[04:45:11] didn't notice doesn't know about Firefly
[04:45:14] that's quick thinking and very Sound
[04:45:17] Logic aventurine is no fool and working
[04:45:21] with him definitely has its whatever you
[04:45:23] say queen uh can I toss a die and let it
[04:45:26] decide bring it up to fate it's just how
[04:45:29] that Gambler
[04:45:31] thinks okay I didn't know my decision
[04:45:33] mattered I'm sorry anyway be careful out
[04:45:35] there my fault there's more than one way
[04:45:37] to blaze a trail blaze a trail in Dark
[04:45:41] Forest beset by Wolves ensuring your own
[04:45:44] escape to safety should be your primary
[04:45:46] concern as for the other
[04:45:49] questions um did Death kill Robin I'm
[04:45:52] not sure the two cases were committed by
[04:45:54] the same culprit but that massive wound
[04:45:58] looked like its winged
[04:46:00] blade plus it seems unlikely that there
[04:46:03] would be two lethal entities loose in
[04:46:06] the
[04:46:08] Dreamscape do you think it's connected
[04:46:10] to acon I can't answer that question
[04:46:13] that Ranger is shrouded but doubt she is
[04:46:17] the most special guest at this banquet
[04:46:20] what do you mean by special Black Swan
[04:46:21] have you noticed anything else unusuals
[04:46:23] appearing one after the other in a very
[04:46:25] short time it is I think it's a double
[04:46:27] murder of itself that's very unusual
[04:46:30] there's an impostor sorry two possib I
[04:46:33] got to stop talking oh the collapse of
[04:46:35] penton's Dreamscape has started speeding
[04:46:37] up making death extremely agitated and
[04:46:41] weakening the family's
[04:46:44] protections or everything has been
[04:46:47] planned out and executed by someone it
[04:46:50] was [ __ ] Misha dumb loser these
[04:46:53] victims deliberately first a stow away
[04:46:56] why are these in family
[04:46:59] celebrity then this murderer's motives
[04:47:02] are worth thoroughly chewing over
[04:47:05] stowaway then celebrity they're going to
[04:47:07] kill a third person they're going to
[04:47:08] kill the [ __ ] leader [ __ ] it
[04:47:12] I don't have any other questions Happ so
[04:47:13] quickly I can only make a
[04:47:15] conjecture after leaving here go have a
[04:47:18] chat with your
[04:47:19] companions I hope you can clarify the
[04:47:22] source of they're going up the rank they
[04:47:23] went from [ __ ] nobody to important
[04:47:25] celebrity to like the CEO of pen I don't
[04:47:28] know who that is
[04:47:29] [Music]
[04:47:32] though left safe Zone a bird way it's a
[04:47:36] short it don't get lost
[04:47:48] this is where

[04:52:21] choice leave the music box behind and
[04:52:25] then go
[04:52:29] Choice the bloody Trail of the

[04:52:53] hunt you could never understand wait a
[04:52:58] second now I could be wrong but I'm
[04:53:00] pretty sure Aaron's not the
[04:53:02] hunt I'm pretty sure I pulled for her
[04:53:04] and it said it said acaron nil but what
[04:53:07] do I know I just I just know builds I'm
[04:53:09] sorry we come from the fire and are born
[04:53:13] beath in
[04:53:15] fire they spread burn and Destroy until
[04:53:20] all the kindling
[04:53:22] has we leave only ashes on the
[04:53:27] ground burning forms the entire life of
[04:53:31] a fire
[04:53:33] demon from the beginning to the
[04:53:38] end we are born want to die just to put
[04:53:43] into practice a profile of another
[04:53:45] universal
[04:53:47] truth all things are created for okay
[04:53:51] this guy's a psycho this guy's
[04:53:54] insane your companions don't seem to
[04:53:57] think so they fight for your chance at
[04:54:01] survival they are my children and just
[04:54:05] as I was they are Flames that have yet
[04:54:10] to burn white
[04:54:12] heart they're still young and I don't BL
[04:54:16] them but my Flames are faint and time is
[04:54:21] running
[04:54:22] out can you see the planet of
[04:54:25] festivities in the
[04:54:28] distance I plan to bring Purgatory with
[04:54:32] me there and before
[04:54:35] that I must surpass you
[04:54:42] why because on the path they
[04:54:45] forged you have traveled farther than I
[04:54:50] have
[04:54:54] emanator
[04:54:56] emanator I don't actually know what that
[04:54:58] means but I'm sure this has a historical
[04:55:00] lore implications I mean I know dude
[04:55:02] acons are equal right in other Universe
[04:55:05] all good you cannot hide maybe maybe not
[04:55:09] true idea
[04:55:11] identity no on my fault that
[04:55:15] sword for we shall indeed remain here
[04:55:20] bound to fight a decisive battle to the
[04:55:23] death for I choose that is a bolded
[04:55:28] choose destruction is
[04:55:32] intense but
[04:55:34] brief to cravenly cling to life is to
[04:55:37] endure an endlessly prol long
[04:55:41] existence even if the answer turns out
[04:55:44] to be your own destruction what is
[04:55:47] important is not the answer but that it
[04:55:51] exists just as you
[04:55:54] exist everything exists to be
[04:55:58] destroyed eminator are if this guy dies
[04:56:01] here did they really just hire a VA for
[04:56:04] this scene and then he's dead forever
[04:56:06] just as even sweet dreams may be that's
[04:56:09] not the newest Quest yeah is trust the
[04:56:11] soal okay it's not but like 2.1 is still
[04:56:15] new really something that has yet to
[04:56:20] happen all right I accept you shall
[04:56:25] witness the most brilliant and intense
[04:56:30] fire in existence a bottomless
[04:56:35] dream yes that's right but you've made
[04:56:39] one small mistake
[04:56:42] this blade remains in its scabard not
[04:56:44] out of pity or scorn it's a personal
[04:56:48] secret that I don't want to disclose
[04:56:51] but perhaps out of
[04:56:56] reciprocity she says this as her hand
[04:56:58] gently rests on the hilt of the sword
[04:57:00] I'll reveal the truth to you the
[04:57:03] Hunt is not the path I truly follow yeah
[04:57:06] no [ __ ] we saw the DM marketing buddy
[04:57:11] May death be the end of your boundless
[04:57:15] dream guiding you back to the waking
[04:57:20] world oh my I still see them in my
[04:57:25] dreams hold it your time hasn't come
[04:57:30] yet the
[04:57:32] [ __ ] my
[04:57:36] time I've seen many clever disguises
[04:57:39] that can con seal appearances but they
[04:57:42] can never cover up who a person really
[04:57:45] is and you're no different you had no
[04:57:48] desire to kill the
[04:57:49] Trailblazer you only did what you did to
[04:57:52] drive me and the away
[04:57:54] but
[04:57:58] why did Destiny slave make you do it you
[04:58:03] know
[04:58:05] Elio Elio I thought this is just the
[04:58:08] kind of thing that' get written into fu
[04:58:12] IO my script has always been
[04:58:17] brief other than that anything beyond
[04:58:21] that is
[04:58:25] unnecessary he knows my
[04:58:28] nature there is but a single Destiny
[04:58:33] from which no one can
[04:58:35] escape and until then I hold the
[04:58:40] privilege of
[04:58:43] choice however you appear to be ignorant
[04:58:47] of this so it's time for me to
[04:58:51] inquire who exactly are
[04:58:58] you not your enemy perhaps mods please
[04:59:02] bam the first time chatted that said I'm
[04:59:04] like Lord farquad if he wasn't a Lord
[04:59:06] please that's not what I ask
[04:59:11] I don't deserve your
[04:59:12] curiosity loners wandering the cosmos
[04:59:15] always have their
[04:59:17] secrets take
[04:59:18] me I've also been wanted by the IPC so
[04:59:22] it's Little Wonder I know something
[04:59:24] about the stellon
[04:59:26] hunters that's
[04:59:28] all maybe I can
[04:59:31] help what reason would you have for
[04:59:35] doing that be 3 months I tend to forget
[04:59:39] things
[04:59:41] which is why rather than memories I'm
[04:59:44] accustomed to using my emotions to
[04:59:46] capture what I normally wouldn't
[04:59:48] otherwise I know who was inside that
[04:59:51] cold
[04:59:52] armor wait did she also see the drip
[04:59:54] marketing me
[04:59:59] too how about it ready to honestly if
[05:00:02] they show it this early it's not even
[05:00:04] spoilers then cuz like realistically
[05:00:06] like the dri marketing came out like a
[05:00:07] week ago so like it's like it's at the
[05:00:10] start of the quest so it's not like it
[05:00:11] was like a big spoiler I mean it kind of
[05:00:13] was yet whatever my fault oh never mind
[05:00:16] she okay well I don't need help but I
[05:00:20] can give you a suggestion that would
[05:00:22] make things better for you and me all
[05:00:25] right so give me a suggestion Sam if
[05:00:26] your goal is the watch Maker's
[05:00:29] Legacy then go look into the
[05:00:33] family not only are they covering up the
[05:00:37] existence of death but they're burying
[05:00:41] the past and the truth about what
[05:00:44] happens inside that looks like a big
[05:00:47] dice
[05:00:48] Escape already on it and the astral
[05:00:54] Express is no enemy of yours true I know
[05:00:58] that I just never expected to hear you
[05:01:00] say a Sam likes us what's next then the
[05:01:05] Trailblazer has been taken by Black
[05:01:07] Swan will you go look for her
[05:01:10] no need for that no harm in mentioning
[05:01:14] that Elio's only given me one
[05:01:18] instruction of the astral Express to
[05:01:21] track down the grand
[05:01:25] Legacy I tried settling this in an
[05:01:28] easier and more direct way but as you
[05:01:32] can see here I am confronting you I
[05:01:38] failed can ever go against the script
[05:01:43] The socalled Impossible is merely
[05:01:45] something that has yet to
[05:01:51] happen that's
[05:01:53] it before we split can I ask you one
[05:01:56] more thing this is going to sound really
[05:01:58] weird to say but why didn't they give
[05:02:00] Sam a bit more cake I'm really sorry for
[05:02:03] saying that I'm just saying if you're
[05:02:04] going to make a big ass robot is there
[05:02:06] anything else in your script about me
[05:02:10] I'd like to know what kind of footnote I
[05:02:12] leave in that R future foreseen by
[05:02:17] Destiny
[05:02:19] unfortunately not a thing came
[05:02:26] up I knew it I knew it
[05:02:32] sorry hang
[05:02:36] on I
[05:02:40] don't don't what your first question
[05:02:46] was do you still have dreams about
[05:02:50] everyone who died because of
[05:02:54] you I
[05:02:56] don't never have well I was born without
[05:03:02] the ability the Sam Sora they they're
[05:03:04] stealing the dreams it it's the's quest
[05:03:08] for this cold harsh reality Sor I'm
[05:03:11] sorry for a little
[05:03:14] life to burn sorry sorry sorry keep
[05:03:17] cringe reference my bad on
[05:03:21] burning until I turn to
[05:03:29] Ash
[05:03:31] so I really Envy
[05:03:35] en is that
[05:03:37] so then you're already living in the
[05:03:40] waking
[05:03:44] world not sure what that last line meant
[05:03:46] to be honest
[05:03:50] but okay that was a cool cut
[05:03:56] scene present day golden
[05:04:00] hour we heard about Miss Firefly from
[05:04:04] Black
[05:04:05] Swan but we never expected miss Robin to
[05:04:12] I'm sorry that I couldn't be with you
[05:04:14] then reality cruises on in Serenity
[05:04:18] while undercurrents Bubble Up from the
[05:04:21] Dreamscape just like that memoe keeper
[05:04:25] said stay strong everyone we can still
[05:04:29] do what we can for them starting with
[05:04:32] finding the murderer let's recap
[05:04:35] everything then the Trailblazer just
[05:04:38] reminded me of something
[05:04:40] March do you remember what that family
[05:04:43] rep who negotiated with us said
[05:04:47] Okay I I I family rep who negotiated
[05:04:51] with us uh yeah from like two quests ago
[05:04:54] I remember yeah indeed we trust that the
[05:04:58] nameless has nothing to do with this and
[05:05:00] we are each of you to help assist the
[05:05:03] family in verifying the identity of the
[05:05:05] deceased I remember that's how it was
[05:05:09] put in reference to miss
[05:05:13] Firefly looking back he seemed a little
[05:05:16] evasive at the time and he also failed
[05:05:19] to mention anything about the earlier
[05:05:21] murder this is the benefit of doing 2.1
[05:05:23] and 2.2 Quest like back to back right
[05:05:25] cuz now because I can do 2.1 and then
[05:05:27] 2.2 I won't forget anything from 2.1
[05:05:30] surely but like the 2.0 [ __ ] that was
[05:05:32] like a year ago the family's planning on
[05:05:35] covering up all news about Miss Robin's
[05:05:37] death if news gets out
[05:05:40] penacon is going to turn into a blood
[05:05:42] bath but the murder that followed
[05:05:44] closely after was obviously beyond their
[05:05:47] anticipation the family had to try and
[05:05:49] turn things to their advantage by
[05:05:51] bringing in reinforcements from
[05:05:53] outside the Charmy Festival is nearly
[05:05:56] here they must be it may also be that
[05:05:59] Miss Firefly's murder had so many
[05:06:01] witnesses that it couldn't be covered up
[05:06:04] so they went with the flow and let more
[05:06:06] people on the scene to control the
[05:06:08] situation
[05:06:10] after all the nature of the two murders
[05:06:13] is fundamentally
[05:06:14] different the family's first protective
[05:06:17] measure should be against malicious
[05:06:19] actors among the guests such as that IPC
[05:06:22] Envoy IPC Envoy he's up to no good Avent
[05:06:26] is on guard against Aron indeed he was
[05:06:29] particularly concerned about that galaxy
[05:06:32] ranger are we missing the forest for the
[05:06:35] trees here I always felt that aventurine
[05:06:38] reasons for accusing Miss saaron were
[05:06:41] highly subtle since when does March
[05:06:44] think am I dumb has she always been like
[05:06:47] I feel like March used to just be like
[05:06:48] oh candy and then Dan Hong would be like
[05:06:52] no
[05:06:53] March since when does she say [ __ ] like
[05:06:56] I always felt like ad adventurin reasons
[05:06:59] for accusing Miss Arron were highly
[05:07:01] subtle at this point that's Pon no no
[05:07:05] like she's not dumb but she's like kind
[05:07:07] of like a like a like a like a like a
[05:07:09] like a puppy like ooh that's
[05:07:12] cool look let's try to gather Intel
[05:07:15] first and then list all the possible
[05:07:17] outcomes we can then we go through them
[05:07:20] eliminating contradictions one by one
[05:07:23] the fewer facts remaining the closer we
[05:07:25] are to the truth I've still got this
[05:07:29] sense of for boing it's like we're stuck
[05:07:32] in a Whirlpool spinning around that
[05:07:34] Legacy even after everything that Legacy
[05:07:38] this time we're playing the role of a
[05:07:39] real
[05:07:40] detective but before we start what are
[05:07:44] we going to say to the family and event
[05:07:46] as I see things the family Harbors no
[05:07:49] ill will towards the astral Express if
[05:07:52] they didn't trust the crew they wouldn't
[05:07:53] have casually commissioned Outsiders to
[05:07:56] investigate a case that's in all
[05:07:57] likelihood a scandal okay so if let me
[05:08:00] get this right if the family doesn't
[05:08:01] hate us and Aron doesn't hate us and
[05:08:04] Firefly rip Bozo not really but maybe
[05:08:06] doesn't like us I mean likes us then why
[05:08:08] the [ __ ] are we here we chilling can't
[05:08:09] we just leave go to another [ __ ]
[05:08:11] planet [ __ ] pany plus this is the turf
[05:08:16] teaming up with them should make things
[05:08:17] easier for us in the
[05:08:21] future as for that
[05:08:24] aventurine well I'd like to hear your
[05:08:27] thoughts I think he's a quite
[05:08:30] interesting man watch He's complex I
[05:08:33] knew it slow I got y I'm going to wake
[05:08:36] up my neighbors while running us all a
[05:08:42] while he appealed convincingly to both
[05:08:45] reason and Tion it wasn't forced but the
[05:08:50] intent was obvious still it's good to
[05:08:53] have contacts among all this
[05:08:55] uncertainty adventurine showed his
[05:08:58] skills reliable Ally also need to keep a
[05:09:01] certain distance from the family never
[05:09:03] there food not here yet almost teaming
[05:09:06] up with the IPC helps balance that out
[05:09:08] if either side makes a move we have the
[05:09:10] option to pull out so you suggest
[05:09:14] accepting a venturine proposal to team
[05:09:16] up Firefly body pillow thanks for the
[05:09:18] five gifted I appreciate you yes it's
[05:09:20] risky but we can only wait until both
[05:09:23] sides have played their cards before
[05:09:25] making any further
[05:09:26] judgments I get why but there's a whole
[05:09:30] lot of bad guys and girls around here
[05:09:33] and I'm worried about getting stabbed in
[05:09:35] the back she has been bullied a few
[05:09:37] times now and I can't understand it
[05:09:41] anymore it's fine you can bully me
[05:09:44] whenever you no I can't accept this
[05:09:49] forget about it just let me keep an eye
[05:09:52] on him if that doesn't work we can just
[05:09:54] turn the tables and use them instead
[05:09:57] then could you please reply to

[05:11:04] damn goal is to try and recapture pone
[05:11:07] for oh you always do okay well I'd like
[05:11:09] to think that my decision mattered have
[05:11:11] to bring down the family in its entirety
[05:11:14] to create a big enough chance the
[05:11:16] existence of death will be covered up by
[05:11:19] the
[05:11:20] family
[05:11:23] um perhaps he's going for the family
[05:11:27] he's definitely going for the family and
[05:11:30] it's just a matter of how the harmony is
[05:11:34] strong in pentacon and almost impossible
[05:11:36] to take on head to-head
[05:11:39] perhap he's going for Aron has devoted
[05:11:41] considerable attention to her perhaps
[05:11:44] he's going for the astral Express I was
[05:11:45] also perhaps he's going for the hotel
[05:11:47] hotel
[05:11:49] guests I'm just speculating in any case
[05:11:54] we have to be careful he's Curr a born
[05:11:57] Gambler if he's willing to go all in to
[05:12:02] win dude I forgot heo when she was
[05:12:05] talking earlier in the cut scene I
[05:12:06] forgot she has like a like a mole and I
[05:12:08] was I was de to wipe my monitor like I
[05:12:10] thought there's like a stain on my
[05:12:11] monitor like a little like
[05:12:14] dot the [ __ ] is this this looks like
[05:12:18] Robin sus I hope it's not too soon to
[05:12:22] bring it up but I feel like miss Robin
[05:12:27] isn't actually dead but that she's still
[05:12:30] alive and
[05:12:31] well somewhere huh that's crazy March
[05:12:35] just some horrible prank because I mean
[05:12:39] probably not aren't we supposed to be
[05:12:41] inside a
[05:12:43] dream how could someone die in a
[05:12:46] beautiful Dreamscape like this shouldn't
[05:12:50] only good things happen here I mean I
[05:12:52] don't know if she's alive or not I just
[05:12:53] know she's in my party but I don't know
[05:12:55] what that says surely it's just a dream
[05:12:57] though Dreamscape
[05:12:58] true whenever I see the Grand Theater I
[05:13:03] just can't stop all these thoughts from
[05:13:05] flooding my
[05:13:06] head you think the family is behind all
[05:13:12] this no no after all they've brought
[05:13:16] everyone this sleepy Dreamscape which
[05:13:18] everyone loves I just feel like I'm
[05:13:22] starting to understand them lesson less
[05:13:25] I don't trust the family March
[05:13:27] everyone's still having a great time out
[05:13:29] there on the
[05:13:30] streets nobody knows what's
[05:13:33] happened it's all so
[05:13:36] unreal as if Firefly
[05:13:39] miss Robin and us we're all Outsiders
[05:13:44] From Another World a what a mess I
[05:13:48] really want a nice cool drink of soda to
[05:13:51] help me calm down yeah let's go get some
[05:13:53] soul
[05:13:54] glad then I'd be just like everyone else
[05:13:57] out on the streets
[05:13:59] true it'll be okay
[05:14:06] March hello welt yang shine said
[05:14:09] something that concerns me he accused
[05:14:12] that galaxy ranger of killing Robin
[05:14:14] without any evidence whatsoever but said
[05:14:17] nothing about her connection to that
[05:14:19] memory Zone meme or why he was stalking
[05:14:24] you it was a groundless accusation which
[05:14:28] only serves to make him seem more
[05:14:32] suspicious dude she's going to be like
[05:14:34] watch watch watch watch aventurine it'll
[05:14:36] come out he was right about everything
[05:14:37] Aron's going to be like I had no choice
[05:14:41] I had a dream and then that's the end of
[05:14:43] the quest Cliffhanger do Advent of other
[05:14:46] plants venturine goal was never to gain
[05:14:49] our trust maybe he wanted to foster a
[05:14:52] feeling of enmity towards acaron and
[05:14:55] make this size of frames wait is
[05:14:57] actually how's it lagging however I
[05:14:59] asked Don hung back on the express to
[05:15:02] confirm that story about the
[05:15:03] annihilation gang and the lost
[05:15:06] messages it wasn't something that
[05:15:07] aventurine out of thin air that's fine
[05:15:10] now I closed my Google what's your
[05:15:12] impression of Miss Aaron I think she's
[05:15:14] cool she definitely let [ __ ] Firefly
[05:15:17] die
[05:15:19] ah she's a very powerful
[05:15:22] woman
[05:15:24] oh
[05:15:26] okay um that fits The Stereotype of a
[05:15:29] galaxy ranger to I guess I can't
[05:15:32] remember they're eccentric
[05:15:36] unpredictable being alone no wonder
[05:15:39] she's a
[05:15:42] suspect yo why can't I talk need
[05:15:45] anything else let's turn our attention
[05:15:47] to this reminds me of the time Ron may
[05:15:49] put [ __ ] drugs in my cup or cake and
[05:15:53] then drugged me but got away with it
[05:15:54] because she's
[05:15:56] pretty let's turn to our attention uh
[05:15:58] the family's assignment for now he what
[05:15:59] do you think among our current Clues the
[05:16:02] two murders that she witnessed are the
[05:16:04] most directly
[05:16:05] connected I suggest starting here
[05:16:09] one thing I'm curious about is if a
[05:16:12] person dies in a dream what happens to
[05:16:15] them in real
[05:16:17] life seeing as we're at the family's
[05:16:20] behest why not pop back out to reality
[05:16:23] and verify Miss Firefly situation back
[05:16:25] at the
[05:16:26] hotel perhaps we could also make a few
[05:16:29] inquiries about miss Robin while we're
[05:16:31] out
[05:16:33] there how about we split off into two
[05:16:35] groups there are still some things worth
[05:16:38] f
[05:16:39] on inside the dreamcap worth focusing on
[05:16:44] oh no problem
[05:16:46] oh no problem huh
[05:16:50] a I will sorry we got a long way to go
[05:16:52] I'm sorry in
[05:16:55] yapping uhoh wel
[05:16:58] moment honored guest could you come out
[05:17:01] for a second wait wait wait well go back
[05:17:03] in the ship brother
[05:17:13] I'd be embarrassed too getting stared
[05:17:15] out like
[05:17:16] that yo forgive me uh my name is wel
[05:17:21] Yang I'm one of the crew members on the
[05:17:23] astral Express I believe you've met my
[05:17:27] colleagues
[05:17:29] well uhoh
[05:17:31] uhoh is there something about my name
[05:17:35] okay full disclosure I know wealth from
[05:17:37] like hongkai third he just like trained
[05:17:39] over but I don't know if like acon knows
[05:17:41] or some [ __ ] as I don't know if he was a
[05:17:43] filler character or not but I feel like
[05:17:45] there's something here don't you want to
[05:17:47] know my name it's written right there
[05:17:50] it's acaron I already do miss acaron
[05:17:53] true you're a prominent figure in
[05:17:55] pentacon she plays on guy
[05:17:58] third what are they saying about me some
[05:18:01] claim that you're the real culprit
[05:18:03] Behind These murders that the
[05:18:05] annihilation gang's tragic fate at the
[05:18:07] banquet was a result of your
[05:18:10] blade and that you're now attempting to
[05:18:13] unleash another bloodbath on
[05:18:16] penone the annihilation gang iFit of
[05:18:20] everflame mansion okay tragic fate that
[05:18:25] Duke turned his dying body to flames and
[05:18:27] sacrificed his life as a martyr he was a
[05:18:30] determined and heroic path
[05:18:32] Strider not even a villain should be
[05:18:34] disparaged like
[05:18:37] this and what more there were plenty of
[05:18:39] suspects
[05:18:40] invited do they really think that a
[05:18:43] blade is more dangerous than that black
[05:18:46] hole you're wielding hey how do you know
[05:18:49] what the hell did she also pull
[05:18:52] we Keen intuition not even the family
[05:18:56] managed to point out the truth behind
[05:18:58] this
[05:19:00] cane so you must surely know Aaron
[05:19:05] peering into a black hole is not a wise
[05:19:08] move as a Potential Threat he's not even
[05:19:10] holding the cane how does she see it
[05:19:13] uncomfortable depths where the [ __ ] is
[05:19:15] bro cane reveal your true identity and
[05:19:19] intentions otherwise brace yourself for
[05:19:22] gravitational
[05:19:26] disintegration that shouldn't be
[05:19:28] necessary but if it makes the nameless
[05:19:31] less def weal is kind of a Chad to
[05:19:34] abide Believe It or Not galaxy ranger
[05:19:38] acaron
[05:19:39] those are the names I go by to this very
[05:19:42] day my trip to panone is solely to
[05:19:45] fulfill an old final request hello is
[05:19:48] that my wife uh yeah I think the food's
[05:19:51] here low
[05:19:53] key do you want to get it or should I
[05:19:55] get it it's like arriving
[05:20:00] now what an idiot sandwich yeah but it's
[05:20:04] like I'm like
[05:20:05] tired do you want me to go get it I can
[05:20:07] go I can go get it don't worry I can go
[05:20:10] get it it's okay can you make me a
[05:20:12] coffee though I I'll make it I'll go get
[05:20:13] it never mind it's like a trade deal no
[05:20:15] it's fine I'll do
[05:20:17] it really good thank
[05:20:20] you thank
[05:20:22] you I'm here for the watchmaker Legacy
[05:20:26] okay and that's
[05:20:27] it I think I've been honest
[05:20:31] enough still unwilling to reveal your
[05:20:34] true
[05:20:36] identity it's not that I don't want to
[05:20:39] it's just that I
[05:20:40] can't I've come so far and I can't sum
[05:20:44] up all of that in just a few
[05:20:46] words everyone has their own unspeakable
[05:20:49] past secrets that they don't want to be
[05:20:53] revealed and I won't be asking any more
[05:20:55] questions such as why the astral Express
[05:20:58] is roaming around the cosmos with a
[05:21:00] stellon on board
[05:21:09] [ __ ] she knows what the [ __ ] did she
[05:21:21] know is she
[05:21:23] okay that memo keeper didn't do anything
[05:21:29] right she's fine let's just stick with
[05:21:32] the topic gaining my trust depends on
[05:21:35] how much you're willing to reveal
[05:21:39] I've run around many different pentacon
[05:21:40] Dreamscapes just to try and find that
[05:21:43] Legacy and during this period I came
[05:21:46] into contact with quite a few
[05:21:48] guests in the process I gradually came
[05:21:51] to
[05:21:52] realize the secret of
[05:21:55] pentacon may be closely related to the
[05:22:02] trailblaze that's why I've come to ask
[05:22:04] for your help I don't have enough proof
[05:22:06] yet but I'd like to speculate something
[05:22:09] probably the source of all tragedy lies
[05:22:11] within the probably I'm never trusted
[05:22:13] the [ __ ] family if you could trust me
[05:22:16] we could find the proof to support this
[05:22:18] claim together Mr Yang I think you've
[05:22:21] come to the same conclusion
[05:22:24] have't let's leave it at that for now
[05:22:28] I'll choose to believe that you bear no
[05:22:31] hostility share your findings with me
[05:22:34] and me alone I don't want vague
[05:22:36] conjecture to interfere with other
[05:22:38] people's judgments before we find solid
[05:22:41] proof mhm mhm by the way would you like
[05:22:46] something to drink before we go how
[05:22:48] about two cups of wake the heck up okay
[05:22:52] no four
[05:22:54] cups because the conversation coming up
[05:22:57] will last forever oh what do you mean by
[05:22:59] that also where is this guy
[05:23:03] looking was his head curved or was that
[05:23:05] just
[05:23:06] me maybe it was just me
[05:23:15] I've been watching closely for a while
[05:23:17] now and the first invitation was in the
[05:23:20] banquet hall of the hotel she just in
[05:23:23] one corner keeping silent chugging down
[05:23:26] a couple cups of wake the heck up I told
[05:23:29] her it's a pungent bitter beverage not
[05:23:32] the taste of sweet dreams only for
[05:23:35] people allergic to Soul glad and she
[05:23:40] said
[05:23:42] really but I don't taste any difference
[05:23:45] at all between
[05:23:49] [Music]
[05:23:51] them the guest rooms are charmingly
[05:23:54] minimalist an aesthetic you share Miss
[05:23:59] Aaron it's a cinch this music box the
[05:24:03] invitation received by the annihilation
[05:24:06] gang their latent m memories that Linger
[05:24:09] on it
[05:24:10] yet you see memories of you are not
[05:24:13] yours alone they travel in other people
[05:24:17] other
[05:24:18] things I know much and I can predict
[05:24:21] even more with some help the dead can be
[05:24:25] made to
[05:24:26] speak the annihilation Gang That Band of
[05:24:30] Desperados who all disappeared after
[05:24:32] meeting you what exactly happened to
[05:24:36] them well let me reveal
[05:24:41] all
[05:24:45] okay gradation
[05:24:49] 12
[05:24:50] Dreamscape
[05:24:53] 12
[05:24:54] father I dedicate this to you well
[05:25:00] done
[05:25:02] dbra wherever they go shall be met by
[05:25:07] annihilation
[05:25:11] there it is it's hazy but it's ifit's
[05:25:14] voice the other one is probably his
[05:25:18] progeny this is the residual memory from
[05:25:21] when the invitation was first delivered
[05:25:24] they were abruptly
[05:25:26] interrupted then what happened next
[05:25:33] is they sought refuge in the land of
[05:25:36] sleep
[05:25:39] merely wishing for undisturbed rest away
[05:25:43] from the
[05:25:44] storms Children of the
[05:25:47] flame this marks your right of
[05:25:52] passage she won't be necessary I alone
[05:25:56] am
[05:25:59] enough when have those on the path of
[05:26:03] Destruction feared death the everflame
[05:26:07] Mansion has set out out on a journey
[05:26:10] those poor people they have no idea what
[05:26:13] lies and weight ahead of them memory
[05:26:16] recovery is going well but slowly she'll
[05:26:19] be here soon and time is
[05:26:22] short there's nobody else here so
[05:26:24] there's no need to be delicate in fact I
[05:26:28] think I'd better go all out
[05:26:35] huh what happened
[05:26:40] okay the memory after that is
[05:26:44] blank how is that
[05:26:46] possible this music box fell into
[05:26:48] Aaron's hands and she brought it to
[05:26:51] penacon that's a fact and that's how it
[05:26:54] should have gone but along the
[05:27:01] way it's like it's been
[05:27:04] erased who's done this
[05:27:09] who are you uhoh who are you
[05:27:13] uhoh it's
[05:27:18] uhoh
[05:27:20] no is this not a
[05:27:23] memory oh a memo keeper did you serve

[05:27:32] cremators my name is Constance a
[05:27:35] pleasure to meet you we were you're
[05:27:38] supposed to meet in pentacon and
[05:27:42] spending Unforgettable time together but

[05:27:51] banquet store and I don't need a [ __ ] is
[05:27:54] do
[05:27:55] ceremony and
[05:27:57] you I know what you're looking

[05:28:06] and then you can enjoy the banquet for
[05:28:12] me I wish you
[05:28:16] Unforgettable
[05:28:19] memories yo oh

[05:28:55] sovereignty has hereby been established

[05:29:07] to the planet's long and bloody history

[05:29:15] seonia 4 is located in an unclaimed Zone
[05:29:18] at the intersection of the Denise prian
[05:29:21] and dorau star clusters this is why very

[05:29:26] planet their home dividing themselves
[05:29:29] into several tribes to eek out Nomad
[05:29:31] Lifestyles as they struggle to survive
[05:29:34] the Arid desert Wilderness they have

[05:34:28] anything just as you guess why is this
[05:34:31] guy here nobody outside I know what you
[05:34:33] are there aren't even baseless
[05:34:35] conspiracy theories they are still
[05:34:38] streaming the rehearsal for her ceremony
[05:34:41] using a standon I
[05:34:43] guess they must be
[05:34:45] dreaming of
[05:34:48] course who could imagine the would
[05:34:50] actually descend upon the idic dream
[05:34:53] created by the family let alone that the
[05:34:56] victim would be the female lead of the
[05:34:57] charmony festival to be honest with you
[05:35:01] I didn't believe it I even tested it a
[05:35:03] few times myself um until I discovered
[05:35:06] that I couldn't actually
[05:35:10] die there's any danger I'm forced to
[05:35:12] wake by The Dream pool and it's all as
[05:35:14] if everything were just a
[05:35:20] nightmare wait did he try to [ __ ]
[05:35:22] silver wolf
[05:35:26] himself imag death actually did descend
[05:35:29] uh dream
[05:35:32] family the victim honestly I didn't
[05:35:34] believe I even tested a few times
[05:35:38] that's why I'm convinced that there are
[05:35:40] a few big secrets lurking behind the
[05:35:44] scenes then you must have heard about
[05:35:46] the memory Zone meme when I graciously
[05:35:49] dained to establish connections with the
[05:35:51] oak family on your behalf they were
[05:35:54] quite in a pitiful state of of disarray
[05:35:57] besides Robin there was another
[05:36:00] body I don't know the exact details just
[05:36:04] that it was a she's more than that okay
[05:36:08] two murder
[05:36:10] cases I told you something seemed off
[05:36:13] about the
[05:36:13] nameless oh she must have come across
[05:36:16] hey what's up guys welcome to my classes
[05:36:18] tier list in uh starting in the a tier
[05:36:21] we have Dr ratio and Ayo and moving up
[05:36:24] to the S tier is going to be Sunday
[05:36:26] thanks for
[05:36:27] watching this murderer is a
[05:36:30] psycho I have to see the case does
[05:36:34] represent an
[05:36:35] opportunity we can Leverage The family's
[05:36:37] malfant and let the IPC use this as a
[05:36:40] reason to
[05:36:41] intervene it's just that their trickery
[05:36:43] runs deeper than I thought Robin standon
[05:36:47] was all ready to
[05:36:49] go these two murders are definitely
[05:36:52] getting hushed
[05:36:54] up what should we
[05:36:56] do let me think it's too rare an
[05:37:00] opportunity to miss out on so I got to
[05:37:03] be
[05:37:05] careful this guy got a gold watch of a
[05:37:07] gold band a [ __ ] double three rings
[05:37:11] incredible Gambler have you already
[05:37:15] exhausted your limited repertoire of
[05:37:17] Tricks so
[05:37:19] soon there are plenty of chips but it'd
[05:37:22] be best to choose
[05:37:24] carefully the most
[05:37:26] straightforward has to be
[05:37:29] Robin remember that masked fool once
[05:37:33] told me to find a mute as a friend Robin
[05:37:36] is what she calls the mute she has lost
[05:37:38] her voice and while most people can't
[05:37:40] pick up on it you and I cannot mistake
[05:37:43] that sound not produced by any voice box
[05:37:46] but rather by the Resonance of the
[05:37:48] harmony wait
[05:37:51] what if that girl hadn't gone horse from
[05:37:54] singing practice there'd only be one
[05:37:57] possibility something was up with the
[05:38:00] family or Robin
[05:38:02] herself to get to the bottom of this I
[05:38:05] tried every way I could to meet her but
[05:38:07] she
[05:38:09] died right before my very eyes okay what
[05:38:13] you have to say it like that a complete
[05:38:15] and utol
[05:38:16] loss incidentally it seems to have
[05:38:19] resulted in your rather undignified
[05:38:22] arrival on the interrogation
[05:38:25] stand there were eyewitnesses at the
[05:38:28] scene and the family in their
[05:38:31] graciousness has tentatively accepted
[05:38:33] your
[05:38:34] Alibi however for for the foreseeable
[05:38:38] future you shall
[05:38:40] regrettably find yourself under the
[05:38:43] Vigilant watch of the hounds well things
[05:38:46] aren't looking too optimistic doctor
[05:38:48] starting to break out in a cold
[05:38:51] sweat do you
[05:38:54] reckon there's still any chance of a
[05:38:56] comeback given how things are a
[05:39:01] probability yes it exists but it verges
[05:39:04] on the infantes smal to phas isn't in a
[05:39:07] matter more befitting the vernacular of
[05:39:09] pentacon you're
[05:39:11] dreaming but if you simply can't control
[05:39:14] yourself and want to try your hand then
[05:39:16] there just so happens to be a suitable
[05:39:19] candidate that man wants to see you
[05:39:22] again who Sunday Sunday I knew
[05:39:27] it is this a public hearing or a private
[05:39:30] trial if it were the former it would
[05:39:34] hardly befit my stature to stoop to the
[05:39:37] the role of a mere
[05:39:41] messenger
[05:39:43] okay
[05:39:47] fine well that's great it's all great
[05:39:50] you see the dead can't talk but the
[05:39:53] living can ratio I'm convinced now that
[05:39:56] there must be something wrong inside the
[05:39:58] family oh just you wait and see Batman's
[05:40:03] sister has died he can't sit on his
[05:40:05] hands without any further further Ado

[05:40:23] oak family's Fortress and a place where

[05:40:34] Fortress I like this metaphor

[06:19:51] again stream the GLE of old blades [ __ ]
[06:19:55] I
[06:20:00] missed uh
[06:20:05] and the joyous tour of toy city has come
[06:20:08] to an end makes me feel
[06:20:11] sad paniconi isn't all bad right I'll
[06:20:15] use this interesting experience as a
[06:20:17] talking point at the poker
[06:20:19] table I think kind of cool
[06:20:36] head to the family's Council chamber and
[06:20:38] face Sunday wait bet it's a pity you
[06:20:42] made it out of the sand pit
[06:20:44] alive Sunday is just beyond this door
[06:20:48] from my limited understanding he's not
[06:20:50] someone easily
[06:20:52] handled are you
[06:20:55] prepared yeah only I believe he's the
[06:20:58] one who should be prepared to face
[06:21:02] me tell me about your plan
[06:21:06] I don't have a plan I'll just play it by
[06:21:08] ear there are only two kinds of
[06:21:11] bargaining chips when dealing with
[06:21:12] people
[06:21:14] benefit or
[06:21:16] fear looks like sincerity isn't in your
[06:21:24] dictionary am I not sincere
[06:21:28] enough there's no need to emphasize it
[06:21:31] we've got to make good use of death and
[06:21:33] I'll the
[06:21:37] murderer the man sister is
[06:21:39] dead he can't do it due to his status
[06:21:42] and position but I can and that's
[06:21:47] benefit on what basis do you believe
[06:21:50] he's incapable necessitating the
[06:21:53] delegation to someone from a rival
[06:21:56] faction the
[06:21:58] IPC simple because that murderer could
[06:22:02] very well be a traitor hiding in inside
[06:22:05] the
[06:22:07] family um do you mean the galaxy ranger
[06:22:12] whom you accused
[06:22:15] previously that was just an excuse good
[06:22:18] doctor there's something wrong with that
[06:22:20] woman we need someone who can keep her
[06:22:22] in check it's better to minimize the
[06:22:25] variables outside our control while we
[06:22:27] execute our
[06:22:29] plans moreover I need to know her
[06:22:32] identity if I'm lucky H she could be an
[06:22:36] important pawn and it's good to have
[06:22:39] more helpful friends when dealing with
[06:22:41] this
[06:22:42] matter but honestly the murder case is
[06:22:45] likely unrelated to her I believe my
[06:22:48] standpoint there's a rat in the family
[06:22:51] otherwise why would Mr Sunday arrange a
[06:22:54] private meeting with
[06:22:55] us this isn't an interrogation but a
[06:22:59] secret
[06:23:01] negotiation we see using Robin death as
[06:23:04] a bargaining ship I'll win back my
[06:23:07] freedom and
[06:23:09] Power in the end I'll ruin this
[06:23:13] beautiful dream and create the grandest
[06:23:17] death if the chance of winning is just
[06:23:20] beyond this
[06:23:21] door even if that chance is close to
[06:23:24] zero
[06:23:25] well you can't win if you don't play Yo
[06:23:29] dongan RPA fans this guy not like a
[06:23:31] slightly or not slightly like pretty
[06:23:33] less insane version of Kida
[06:23:36] thoughts the I thought he'd be as insane
[06:23:38] he a bit less insane to think that you
[06:23:41] of all people might emerge Victorious
[06:23:44] dear Gambler no okay three chips are
[06:23:47] enough what do you mean no yes for
[06:23:59] nothing meet Sunday face to face all
[06:24:01] right I'm going to go as
[06:24:02] Robin sister you're
[06:24:06] back [ __ ] thought I could sneak up on
[06:24:08] him my puzzles are too effortless for
[06:24:10] you IPC Ambassador I appreciate your
[06:24:14] words and I see you put a lot of effort
[06:24:17] into welcoming me Mr
[06:24:21] Sunday however this is no way to greet a
[06:24:25] guest well this isn't an invitation but
[06:24:28] a summoning before we speak I need to
[06:24:32] test your character
[06:24:34] I imagine this knowledgeable doctor
[06:24:37] friend of yours has been of great help
[06:24:40] yes
[06:24:42] certainly you ought to know this better
[06:24:44] than I do he's already Faithfully
[06:24:47] fulfilled his
[06:24:49] duties hasn't
[06:24:51] he yes the doctor has assured me of your
[06:24:54] noble character he considers you like
[06:24:58] himself a virtuous person who can be
[06:25:00] trusted by the
[06:25:02] family I have come to to know you very
[06:25:05] well as a person Mr
[06:25:07] aventurine you're diligent generous and
[06:25:11] willing to
[06:25:12] cooperate the fact that you succeeded in
[06:25:15] overcoming many obstacles just to meet
[06:25:17] me gave me the reason to believe in your
[06:25:20] wisdom and
[06:25:22] courage but there's one thing I must ask
[06:25:26] you that is you've used your wisdom at
[06:25:29] the wrong place to meet the wrong person
[06:25:32] and put yourself in a situation where
[06:25:34] you shouldn't be witnessing a tragedy
[06:25:37] that shouldn't have
[06:25:39] happened you don't look too well am I
[06:25:42] making you
[06:25:45] anxious if not then it means I'm on your
[06:25:48] side if I wasn't mistaken you'd just
[06:25:52] made a serious accusation against the
[06:25:56] family no you weren't mistaken for
[06:26:00] depravity is creeping in around you
[06:26:05] there's no need for us to be
[06:26:07] evasive let's talk about your
[06:26:10] sister your sister's Talent is unrivaled
[06:26:13] in the world of show
[06:26:14] business as you know her voice has been
[06:26:17] out of tune since she returned to it's
[06:26:20] not out of tune once more
[06:26:23] disheartening she can't sing
[06:26:26] anymore who could be responsible for
[06:26:29] this many suspect the culprit is Among
[06:26:31] The Outsiders but I know
[06:26:35] you hold a different
[06:26:38] opinion now your Noble status has become
[06:26:40] a shackle preventing you from
[06:26:42] apprehending the murderer and avenging
[06:26:44] your sister's death you're feeling
[06:26:46] anxious because you're out on a
[06:26:48] limb but don't worry I'm on your
[06:26:53] side I'm immensely honored by your
[06:26:55] concern for me Mr aventurine since
[06:26:58] you're so selfless and generous I
[06:27:01] believe you wouldn't ask for anything in
[06:27:03] return would
[06:27:05] you well naturally you wouldn't incur
[06:27:07] any loss from this I just want to
[06:27:10] reclaim what is mine my Liberty and the
[06:27:14] personal items under the family's
[06:27:17] custody the bag of gift money and that's
[06:27:20] a pretty long list buddy the Box in
[06:27:22] which the Cornerstone is
[06:27:25] stored that's
[06:27:27] right
[06:27:29] Cornerstone I've heard it's a treasured
[06:27:31] asset is that the [ __ ] Minecraft or a
[06:27:34] sacred
[06:27:35] stone preservation I guess
[06:27:39] Cobblestone power and every liquidation
[06:27:42] specialist holds
[06:27:44] one for an object so precious it
[06:27:47] probably comes at an even higher price
[06:27:50] than other forms of
[06:27:52] recompense well I'm sure you're aware of
[06:27:54] the high level of risk I'll be
[06:27:56] undertaking to bring the truth to light
[06:27:59] Mr aventurine when you're out and about
[06:28:03] do you always make adjustments to your
[06:28:05] appearance your tie should be on the
[06:28:07] center line your shirt must not protrude
[06:28:10] from your vest your trouser creases
[06:28:13] should be perfectly straight and always
[06:28:15] aligned with the tips of your shoes of
[06:28:19] course but I don't because it's not
[06:28:22] appropriate to do so in
[06:28:24] public of course you make sure
[06:28:26] everything is presentable and in order
[06:28:28] before leaving the
[06:28:30] house I'm not the kind that takes risks
[06:28:34] the Cornerstone must be in the custody
[06:28:36] of the
[06:28:37] family no room for
[06:28:40] negotiation please don't let me turn you
[06:28:43] down
[06:28:45] twice sure the gift money is good enough
[06:28:49] I suppose you wouldn't mind that after
[06:28:52] all a merchant can't function without a
[06:28:54] bargaining
[06:28:55] ship you compromised quicker than I
[06:28:58] thought unfortunately it's a gambler
[06:29:01] that needs a bargaining chip not a mer
[06:29:04] Merchant I can give you your gift money
[06:29:07] but before that I want you to tell
[06:29:11] me
[06:29:15] uhoh the fact that you can decisively
[06:29:18] forsake the Box you asked for what
[06:29:21] exactly is stored in
[06:29:28] it oh triplef faced Soul please sear his
[06:29:32] tongue PS with a iron so that he will
[06:29:35] not be able to fabricate lies and make
[06:29:38] false
[06:29:42] vows what have you
[06:29:44] done under the light of the harmony all
[06:29:48] wickedness is
[06:29:49] revealed I implore them to shed their
[06:29:52] light and I'll ask you questions on
[06:29:55] their
[06:29:56] behalf next you have 113 seconds to
[06:30:01] prove your innocence what the gain m
[06:30:04] what Ron May did but without drugging
[06:30:08] us and if I refuse to answer you can try
[06:30:13] and we'll see if the harmony rejects
[06:30:19] you question do you own a
[06:30:23] Cornerstone no I mean I went I haven't
[06:30:25] played Minecraft in a while I went
[06:30:26] mining once but it's what a simple
[06:30:30] answer you too understand that Idol
[06:30:33] chatter leads only to
[06:30:36] Poverty did you hand over the
[06:30:38] Cornerstone to the family when you
[06:30:40] entered
[06:30:41] pentacon yes does the Cornerstone you
[06:30:44] handed over to the family belong to
[06:30:47] you yes is your Cornerstone in this room
[06:30:51] right now yes is your memory free from
[06:30:55] any kind of tampering or deletion
[06:30:57] encompassing but not restricted to the
[06:30:59] techniques of the garden of
[06:31:02] recollection encompassing
[06:31:05] yes are you an Ain from
[06:31:09] seonia
[06:31:11] yes you even know about that do the Ain
[06:31:15] have any ability to read temper with or
[06:31:18] manipulate one's own or another's
[06:31:21] mind no does it
[06:31:26] matter do you love your family more than
[06:31:29] yourself
[06:31:35] yes all the Ain were killed in a
[06:31:38] massacre Am I who invited [ __ ]
[06:31:42] Oz no are you your Clan's sole
[06:31:51] survivor
[06:31:54] perhaps do you hate and wish to destroy
[06:31:58] this world with your own hands
[06:32:04] I don't
[06:32:06] know
[06:32:08] interesting now the final
[06:32:13] question can you swear that at this very
[06:32:16] moment the aventurine stone is safe and
[06:32:19] sound in this
[06:32:21] box
[06:32:28] huh h
[06:32:34] of
[06:32:36] course looks like we can get an answer
[06:32:40] open it Mr
[06:32:41] aventurine it's your last chance to
[06:32:44] defend your
[06:32:46] honor wait if this guy can force you to
[06:32:48] tell the truth why don't you just
[06:32:49] [ __ ] just punch him thoughts just
[06:32:52] just literally punch him before he can
[06:32:53] read your mind [ __ ] it he's probably not
[06:32:56] that strong well has a black hole in his
[06:32:58] Cane the [ __ ] is he going to do against
[06:33:01] wel oo I have a family okay I have a
[06:33:04] [ __ ]
[06:33:07] sword plus your sister's dead plus ratio
[06:33:10] sorry that was [ __ ] what's up ratio
[06:33:18] please that was [ __ ] though I'm sorry
[06:33:20] I like Robin she's probably fine oh are
[06:33:24] these what you're looking for
[06:33:40] [ __ ] how do you find the
[06:33:43] Learned does this mean that you are
[06:33:45] willing to take the side of the family
[06:33:47] in this
[06:33:51] farce what makes you think you can
[06:33:54] convince
[06:33:56] me I've heard you haven't enjoyed Mr
[06:33:58] aventurine company I also understand
[06:34:02] that you're an avid learner who sees the
[06:34:04] pursuit of knowledge above
[06:34:07] all in that case you ought to realize
[06:34:10] that a competent scholar knows their
[06:34:13] position and wouldn't forsake more vital
[06:34:16] matters for the sake of petty Pride
[06:34:19] that's fair if you agree to assist the
[06:34:22] family I'll share our research findings
[06:34:25] on the stellon [ __ ] that's me
[06:34:27] just ask me aware that besides the
[06:34:30] family no other faction is willing to
[06:34:33] share such
[06:34:39] information cut to the chase what do you
[06:34:43] need from
[06:34:47] me I need Mr aventurine comprehensive
[06:34:51] what do you need for me I need your
[06:34:54] cocken okay my fault I'm
[06:34:57] sorry you can't expect a featherless
[06:35:01] bird to take flight
[06:35:04] but I've also heard the 10 Elites in the
[06:35:07] Strategic investment Department haveed
[06:35:10] progress why would you say that I'm IPC
[06:35:12] I'm
[06:35:14] sorry you'll have to speak more clearly
[06:35:17] than
[06:35:21] that the Cornerstone which Mr aventurine
[06:35:26] surrendered was it really his
[06:35:31] oh you question whether he would would
[06:35:33] entrust you with someone else's
[06:35:36] Cornerstone the 10 stone hearts aren't
[06:35:39] as United as you think cornerstones are
[06:35:43] significantly more precious to them than
[06:35:46] their very own lives okay but you know
[06:35:50] that he's a crazed Gambler the more
[06:35:52] vocal he is about it the more cautious I
[06:35:55] must
[06:35:59] be I never imagined someone would share
[06:36:03] his way of
[06:36:04] thinking honestly you should see a
[06:36:08] shrink bring it the Box containing the
[06:36:12] Cornerstone is unique and only IPC
[06:36:16] senior staff and related members can
[06:36:18] access it but I happen to be among
[06:36:23] them
[06:36:32] okay I appreciate appreciate it okay
[06:36:35] here's my take uh uh Sunday whenever
[06:36:37] this [ __ ] comes out they're going to
[06:36:39] have to they're going to release a quest
[06:36:40] that's like I feel like every time they
[06:36:41] release a quest it like sells the
[06:36:43] characters that are on the banner this
[06:36:44] one's going to make us like a venturine
[06:36:46] 2.2 is going to make us [ __ ] fall in
[06:36:47] love with like Robin then we're going to
[06:36:49] be like oh my God Firefly is so cool and
[06:36:51] then Sunday right now he's kind of a
[06:36:52] dick like no one likes him but I feel
[06:36:54] like like they're going to make like a
[06:36:55] 2. [ __ ] five Quest be like wow look
[06:36:57] at how cool Sunday is actually he loves
[06:36:59] his family actually he's not wrong
[06:37:01] actually and then people like oh my God
[06:37:02] I I always is like
[06:37:05] Sunday not my
[06:37:09] fault I like him ragy I mean his
[06:37:12] Design's right but unfortunately your
[06:37:15] guess is
[06:37:22] correct the Golden
[06:37:24] Stone its color and glow are similar to
[06:37:27] that of kipo's
[06:37:31] body this is the Very Room he intends to
[06:37:34] use to fool you he won't reveal to you
[06:37:38] that the 10 ston Hearts chisel their own
[06:37:40] will into the cornerstones granting them
[06:37:43] an unparalleled r y why are you [ __ ]
[06:37:46] ratting them out and this Golden Stone
[06:37:50] is also known as a topaz not a venturine
[06:37:55] the [ __ ] topaz and it belongs to Topaz
[06:38:01] yo so do you wish to confront him what
[06:38:07] the [ __ ] man not at the moment I'm more
[06:38:10] interested to know the location of his
[06:38:13] Cornerstone the safest place somewhere
[06:38:15] you'd never think of because he never
[06:38:19] intended to hide it in fact that
[06:38:22] Cornerstone has been in your hands from
[06:38:25] the very beginning
[06:38:34] I see this bag mixing a Cornerstone more
[06:38:40] precious than life itself with a bunch
[06:38:42] of worthless Jewels disguised as a gift
[06:38:46] of money waiting to be
[06:38:48] confiscated is indeed in line with Mr
[06:38:51] aventurine style Y racio what the [ __ ]
[06:38:54] are you doing then he makes up some
[06:38:56] trivial excuse downplaying the matter
[06:38:59] and requests the gift money this is a
[06:39:02] gamble one he's all too familiar with
[06:39:05] betting on your single misstep leading
[06:39:08] to a total loss learn it doctor I am
[06:39:13] grateful for your help the family will
[06:39:15] surely reward a righteous person like
[06:39:18] you as for the
[06:39:22] villain I hope he retreats in
[06:39:29] humiliation it was all thanks to your
[06:39:31] friend with a Keen Eye that I could add
[06:39:34] a blot of utter failure to your story
[06:39:36] [Music]
[06:39:38] career ratio you
[06:39:43] wret finally shown your true colors huh
[06:39:47] oh and just to remind you you currently
[06:39:51] only have 17 system hours left to live
[06:39:54] treasure your remaining time and Savor
[06:39:57] The Delectable aftertaste of oh my God
[06:40:01] 17 you might as well explain yourself a
[06:40:04] little more
[06:40:05] clearly what I performed on you just now
[06:40:08] was the harmonies
[06:40:10] consecration you were to show Allegiance
[06:40:12] beneath the illumination of their Grace
[06:40:16] yet you acted willfully uttering nothing
[06:40:19] but falsehoods transforming the
[06:40:22] consecration into a
[06:40:24] trial I genuinely see no reason to
[06:40:27] absolve you from
[06:40:29] it is this what the harmony represents
[06:40:32] but is it built upon constraint and
[06:40:34] coercion
[06:40:36] yep you misunderstand Mr aventurine
[06:40:40] punishment is meant for the irreverent
[06:40:43] but I have seen your resilient Spirit
[06:40:46] I'm with sparkle on this one I'm aian
[06:40:48] [ __ ] Harmony
[06:40:53] beginning throughout these 17 system
[06:40:56] hours you will be unable to escape the
[06:40:59] Dreamscape or contact any of your
[06:41:02] companions
[06:41:03] you only have two paths before you and
[06:41:06] it all depends on whether you can
[06:41:08] complete my test within the time limit
[06:41:11] should you succeed you will be able to
[06:41:13] coales into the Harmony and be with your
[06:41:17] family if you fail you will suffer the
[06:41:21] Wrath of the Eternal
[06:41:23] Centurion and fall into an abyss of
[06:41:29] Doom sounds like I'm going to end up the
[06:41:32] same either way
[06:41:33] I indeed do need a servant to help me
[06:41:36] uncover the evil hidden in the family
[06:41:38] from an external
[06:41:40] perspective I will Purge the evil from
[06:41:43] the inside and bring the real culprits
[06:41:46] to Justice within 17 system hours when
[06:41:49] the time comes compare your findings
[06:41:52] with mine if both our findings align or
[06:41:56] if you can provide me more insights then
[06:41:59] they will truly be able to Grant you
[06:42:01] mercy and honesty
[06:42:03] Shameless
[06:42:05] Hypocrites you took everything from me
[06:42:07] and still demand the truth that isn't
[06:42:10] fair your Carnival reeks with a stench
[06:42:13] of cash nothing is achievable without
[06:42:20] it this is meant to be an act of
[06:42:22] personal virtue not requiring the
[06:42:25] family's
[06:42:26] support your bag is over there do as you
[06:42:30] please I believe you can trade this bag
[06:42:32] of worth Jewels for everything you need
[06:42:35] that's what gamblers excel at isn't
[06:42:40] it off you go Mr
[06:42:43] aventurine you are
[06:42:45] free I will wait here for your good
[06:42:56] news this meeting isn't an interrogation
[06:42:59] or a
[06:43:00] negotiation it's an outright exit
[06:43:05] execution why would I do that Mr
[06:43:07] aventurine I'm just wondering what a
[06:43:09] passerby who stumbled upon a scene of a
[06:43:11] murder could have found out that's
[06:43:17] all by the way before you go I have a
[06:43:21] personal
[06:43:22] question what is it
[06:43:25] now

[06:43:30] destruction of this world yep
[06:43:38] kavasa where did you
[06:43:40] go are you injured I got it back sister
[06:43:45] uhoh he had a sister you went to look

[06:43:50] dangerous it's just a necklace it's
[06:43:52] neither food nor water we can survive
[06:43:55] without it but I can't live without you
[06:43:58] little
[06:43:59] brother promise me not to look for those

[06:44:15] Won what happened exactly you think he's
[06:44:17] about to gamble his sister away by
[06:44:19] accident I made a bet with them the two
[06:44:22] birds in the desert and me who will die
[06:44:24] first I
[06:44:26] won they suspected me of cheating but I
[06:44:29] didn't I W fair and
[06:44:31] square of course

[06:44:36] lucky child GATRA triclops must be
[06:44:39] watching over you but that's no reason
[06:44:42] to push your luck by going up against
[06:44:44] those those bloodthirsty cruel
[06:44:47] kakin have you forgotten how Mom and
[06:44:52] Dad look this is just a
[06:44:56] necklace but

[06:45:07] happy because mom left you this

[06:45:19] important as you my dearest brother I I
[06:45:22] don't blame you but you must remember
[06:45:24] what Mom said pain and poverty are the
[06:45:27] trials of GATRA

[06:45:48] happiness so always remember to protect

[06:46:03] okay if I hear [ __ ] gath Triceratops
[06:46:06] one more
[06:46:07] time but sister Gia triclops was really
[06:46:11] watching over
[06:46:13] us then why did she not protect dad when
[06:46:15] he was Swept Away by the quicksand after
[06:46:18] all dad went to the kakin land only to
[06:46:21] prepare for giaa triclops
[06:46:24] offerings and where was giaa triclops
[06:46:27] when Mom was shivering in our arms mom
[06:46:30] was still pleading for GATRA triclops
[06:46:32] forgiveness under her breath until the
[06:46:35] moment she closed her
[06:46:37] eyes sister everyone Praises me for
[06:46:41] being smart but I don't get it if every
[06:46:44] rain pour was di triclops forgiveness
[06:46:47] and
[06:46:49] Grace then how bad were our
[06:46:52] sins so much so that we were born in
[06:46:56] this world of
[06:47:00] death well
[06:47:03] was kind of
[06:47:11] spitting um excuse me I can't seem to
[06:47:15] find any information on this artist in
[06:47:17] the iris family
[06:47:19] archives just as I
[06:47:21] thought I'd like to ask what kind of
[06:47:25] traces do people leave when they enter a
[06:47:27] dream are you referring to the records
[06:47:30] when you enter
[06:47:33] I apologize the yeah my bad dude it's an
[06:47:37] NPC I'm not is managed by The Blood
[06:47:39] Hound family we can only gain access if
[06:47:41] there's a problem looks like nothing can
[06:47:44] be found here at least we know who to
[06:47:47] look for next we can ask the blood hound
[06:47:50] family for information thank you for
[06:47:52] your assistance Miss Ally by the way is
[06:47:56] Miss Robin Rob fine fine what does that
[06:47:59] mean is there something wrong with Miss
[06:48:02] Robin
[06:48:03] the preparations for the charm no
[06:48:04] nothing wrong with Robin proed Robin's
[06:48:07] fine I guess things are pretty
[06:48:09] good I'm sure yeah Robin's doing
[06:48:14] great sure enough no one knows about
[06:48:17] miss Robin I but that Miss Firefly is
[06:48:20] truly
[06:48:21] mysterious there's no information on her
[06:48:24] in the hotel system even if she's a
[06:48:26] stowaway she should have a disguised
[06:48:29] identity after entering the planet she's
[06:48:32] also in the Run for the
[06:48:33] Legacy how is she going to sneak into
[06:48:36] the Dreamscape
[06:48:38] unnoticed is there any other way I
[06:48:40] wonder
[06:48:41] how besides the a dream pool the memo
[06:48:45] keepers have abilities that are
[06:48:47] difficult for normal people to
[06:48:49] comprehend in the memory zone of penacon
[06:48:52] they Thrive effortlessly a fact proven
[06:48:54] to us by Black Swan the hacker girl from
[06:48:57] The stellon Hunters used extraordinary
[06:48:59] means to unlock the Dreamscape Hotel
[06:49:02] seal
[06:49:03] according to the scene witnessed by her
[06:49:06] it is likely that they are behind Miss
[06:49:08] Firefly's case the guardan of
[06:49:11] recollection and the stellon
[06:49:14] hunters both are possible but what about
[06:49:18] the

[06:57:20] even know my name of course I do you
[06:57:22] folks are from the legendary astral
[06:57:24] Express and honorable guests of the
[06:57:27] watchmaker I had an encounter with this
[06:57:30] lady in the golden app
[06:57:32] I'm sorry for what happened to that
[06:57:36] kid this is also the reason why we've
[06:57:38] come to visit you Mr Gallagher the
[06:57:41] express can't just Overlook the death of
[06:57:43] that child so we've decided to help the
[06:57:46] family get to the bottom of it in the
[06:57:48] hopes of getting Justice for her the
[06:57:51] nameless involved with the family what
[06:57:54] an unpredictable twist of
[06:57:57] fate
[06:57:59] why what's wrong with the family no
[06:58:02] nothing march on Penton everyone loves
[06:58:05] the family smile no matter how much one
[06:58:07] resists the beautiful dream when the
[06:58:09] time comes they too will find it hard to
[06:58:11] let go who wants to leave a warm Nest Mr
[06:58:15] Gallagher seems to be getting at
[06:58:17] something you got it wrong I'm not you
[06:58:21] want to discuss the case sure come with
[06:58:24] me okay this is not a good place to talk
[06:58:27] let's go
[06:58:28] elsewhere dude I feel like I ate too
[06:58:31] fast I [ __ ] IC
[06:58:39] hurts
[06:58:42] M even after that chilling tragedy
[06:58:46] they're still [ __ ] yapping still
[06:58:47] running effortlessly other than the
[06:58:50] family of the harmony it's hard to
[06:58:52] imagine any other power in the universe
[06:58:55] that could sustain a building of such
[06:58:57] magnitude the Family itself is a huge
[06:59:00] perfect building like a living Idol each
[06:59:05] member of the family sees themselves as
[06:59:07] a piece of the Divine puzzle revolving
[06:59:09] around a singular core and a shared
[06:59:12] ideal under their command they loyally
[06:59:15] fulfill their roles offering themselves
[06:59:18] while also receiving sustenance in
[06:59:20] return the harmony interesting analogy
[06:59:23] perhaps that's why penton's beautiful
[06:59:26] dream has persisted for so long but the
[06:59:30] human body has its limits and so does
[06:59:32] the divines that doesn't sound like the
[06:59:35] kind of comment a galaxy ranger would
[06:59:37] make just pointing out the facts Mr Yang
[06:59:40] will definitely have a better sense of
[06:59:42] what's going on the night why do you say
[06:59:45] that miss agaron the beautiful dream is
[06:59:49] crumbling but not because of a
[06:59:51] particular Eon a particular faction or a
[06:59:53] particular visitor that's collaps stems
[06:59:56] from a certain inevitability of human
[06:59:59] nature as people immerse their souls in
[07:00:02] the Dreamscape where consequences and
[07:00:05] pain cease to exist and only ease and
[07:00:08] pleasure Prevail they draw closer and
[07:00:11] closer
[07:00:12] necrosis what the [ __ ] is necrosis Bliss
[07:00:16] death looms
[07:00:20] necrosis also this necros death body
[07:00:22] tissue spread one piece of the puzzle's
[07:00:25] mutation one will eventually cause the
[07:00:27] entire building to shake
[07:00:29] break and CR
[07:00:32] in the end the dreams that people built
[07:00:34] in the name of Freedom became the cage
[07:00:37] that imprisoned them I'm sure you've
[07:00:40] gained a lot from this trip Miss
[07:00:43] acaron are you willing to share your
[07:00:46] findings with me of
[07:00:49] course that's if I
[07:00:52] remember she say as her hand gently rest
[07:00:54] on the hilt of the sword and then
[07:00:56] quickly let's go in the blink of an
[07:00:59] eye don't mind me it's just a habit
[07:01:03] going to events in the past I've become
[07:01:07] easily
[07:01:09] forgetful it's only when this sword is
[07:01:11] unshed that those hazy M start to become
[07:01:15] clearer take your
[07:01:17] time that should do it I vividly
[07:01:21] remember everything that occurred on
[07:01:23] pentacon ask
[07:01:29] away the moment of d break I've heard
[07:01:33] that's where the dawn Factory which
[07:01:35] processes the foundation of the
[07:01:37] Dreamscape is located behind the
[07:01:39] Dreamscape song and dance and many
[07:01:42] imagination
[07:01:43] factories workers create all kinds of
[07:01:46] whimsical Works St in and day out in
[07:01:48] their dreams then they return they say
[07:01:50] it will suffice there I encountered a
[07:01:52] young woman who had just come of age the
[07:01:55] perfect time to indulge in beautiful
[07:01:58] dreams her greatest wish want to one day
[07:02:01] move to the golden hour and see the
[07:02:04] Magnificent garments she had woven with
[07:02:06] her own hands for certain reasons her
[07:02:08] wish
[07:02:09] was difficult to
[07:02:12] fulfill but I managed to bring her a
[07:02:16] garment huh gilded hour it yes it is a
[07:02:22] everyone there is exquisitly brasted and
[07:02:24] always I've never met anyone who was
[07:02:25] willing to talk I could only stand at
[07:02:28] the crossroads watching crowds they
[07:02:31] would open kind of don't care about
[07:02:33] [ __ ] gilded hour moment of dusk of
[07:02:37] luxury and consumerism then you all must
[07:02:39] have seen those who are attempting to
[07:02:41] realize their
[07:02:43] dreams or have realized
[07:02:45] [Music]
[07:02:47] them himself ton had been auctioned off
[07:02:50] a dozen times this time around there
[07:02:52] were no success with it all right this
[07:02:54] is what I've seen and heard along the
[07:02:56] way so tldr pentony aware
[07:03:02] someone once said to
[07:03:03] me penone wasn't like this a long time
[07:03:06] ago nor should it be I've traveled
[07:03:09] through the reality and Dreamscape of
[07:03:11] the planet of festivities okay watched
[07:03:14] the tides of night rise and fall okay
[07:03:17] when time stopped for people
[07:03:19] okay where the spirits of the Rich and
[07:03:23] impoverished remain forever fixed on
[07:03:25] their own
[07:03:27] scales this is why I think the collapse
[07:03:29] of the beautiful dream
[07:03:32] is
[07:03:33] inevitable there might be a way to
[07:03:36] change everything this changes
[07:03:38] everything call Ed but if this is indeed
[07:03:42] the world that people desire wait if
[07:03:45] this is precisely why life chooses to
[07:03:48] Slumber should we still seek to change
[07:03:54] it me too El Miss acaron now it's my
[07:03:59] turn to share a story with you
[07:04:02] when I was a boy from my homeland who at
[07:04:05] a time when the world was grappling with
[07:04:08] deep unhealable pain made a choice he wo
[07:04:14] together the dreams of everyone in the
[07:04:16] world linking people's Dreamscapes and
[07:04:20] shouldered this burden himself from this
[07:04:24] he created a giant uh spiritual
[07:04:28] Adam who the [ __ ] is Adam the Giant
[07:04:32] stood Between Heaven and Earth becoming
[07:04:34] the pillar of the world's existence as a
[07:04:38] price those who found it hard to move
[07:04:41] forward who could not Advance forever
[07:04:45] lost their future they slumbered in a
[07:04:49] dream devoid of disaster and pain living
[07:04:53] out their days peacefully in the man's
[07:04:56] created Utopia and it is because of the
[07:05:00] wishes of those people who wished not to
[07:05:02] awaken that this spiritual atom became
[07:05:08] unbreakable and yet you stand here right
[07:05:11] now which also
[07:05:13] means that man
[07:05:17] failed because people must always move
[07:05:20] towards the future even if human
[07:05:23] weaknesses make them pause when they
[07:05:25] truly cannot move forward Humanity will
[07:05:29] eventually seek a way to save it self
[07:05:32] and that man he was never a failure like
[07:05:37] everyone in that world he etched the
[07:05:41] possibilities of human nature into his
[07:05:44] heart he was the sunchaser of Legend
[07:05:48] soaring towards the sky and embracing
[07:05:52] his final Victory with his
[07:05:54] fall I'm okay well ascended to Heights
[07:05:57] Uncharted only to come face to face with
[07:06:00] the Sun a place not visited by anyone
[07:06:03] before his wings would melt because of
[07:06:07] it only for him to fall into the sea and
[07:06:10] after
[07:06:11] that countless others would surpass him
[07:06:15] soaring to even greater
[07:06:20] Heights A fitting metaphor for the
[07:06:22] nameless his trailblazing spirit thank
[07:06:25] you Mr Yang I know what you wish to
[07:06:28] confirm the universe has innumerable
[07:06:31] similar yet different
[07:06:34] worlds in these worlds there are
[07:06:36] innumerable people who look alike yet
[07:06:40] don't I too have embarked on Journeys
[07:06:43] encountering old friends with familiar
[07:06:45] faces on different worlds s witnessing
[07:06:48] their Destinies follow paths similar to
[07:06:51] mine so I will tell you even if not
[07:06:56] completely
[07:06:56] [Music]
[07:06:58] similar the story you just told
[07:07:03] it overlaps with my
[07:07:05] past and within that Abyssal
[07:07:08] dream I ended that man's life
[07:07:14] [Music]
[07:07:18] yo I am not who you think I
[07:07:20] am nor will my home be as fortunate as
[07:07:23] your
[07:07:25] world I am sorry it's fine I don't mind
[07:07:30] so long as I can late your
[07:07:33] suspicions there's something I still
[07:07:35] wish to know Miss
[07:07:37] acaron under that representation of the
[07:07:40] hunt exactly what sort of power is it
[07:07:45] that has motivated your solitary Journey
[07:07:48] thus
[07:07:50] far Mr Yang before answering that
[07:07:54] question I wish to continue the previous
[07:07:59] topic I like your analogy very much
[07:08:02] indeed birds are born to fly D what are
[07:08:05] you but in a distant past their
[07:08:07] ancestors could only gaze at the sky in
[07:08:10] Envy they saw that far away ray of light
[07:08:13] from above the heavens piercing through
[07:08:15] the clouds and blanketing the
[07:08:17] Earth and so time and time again
[07:08:20] generation after generation the birds
[07:08:23] spread their wings and took to the sky
[07:08:26] attempting to touch its
[07:08:28] ceiling all because the sun was there
[07:08:32] then what if the last bird finally
[07:08:35] Soares into the sky only to realize that
[07:08:39] the end of the light is not the Sun but
[07:08:42] Darkness all consuming black
[07:08:45] hole the
[07:08:46] [ __ ] then why
[07:08:50] exactly do we even walk towards the
[07:08:53] light
[07:09:03] oh it's this
[07:09:13] part long time no see having fun on
[07:09:17] penone Aaron this guy sounds extra

[07:15:51] falling
[07:15:55] asleep do you know Kevin kind of cuz I
[07:16:00] think when we watched this the the
[07:16:01] Hawkeye third concert you guys are
[07:16:03] yapping about Kevin I kind of remember
[07:16:05] that like
[07:16:15] faintly pretty close to finishing
[07:16:17] actually wait really okay maybe next
[07:16:19] time we'll do this and 2.2 Quest
[07:16:22] thoughts 80% done wait really that's not
[07:16:25] even
[07:16:27] bad no okay never mind I guess we're
[07:16:29] like 30%
[07:16:31] halfway they're lying dude shut dude let
[07:16:33] me believe
[07:16:42] it see you next month no I'll probably
[07:16:44] stream again in two days I think maybe
[07:16:46] tomorrow but realistically well I guess
[07:16:48] depending when you watch this it might
[07:16:49] be 20 like
[07:16:53] tomorrow like probably I sleep now then
[07:16:56] no stream like today but then one
[07:16:57] tomorrow type [ __ ] you get me we'll
[07:16:59] probably do star again maybe genin first
[07:17:01] I don't know but probably star and then
[07:17:03] another like probably next to Star and
[07:17:04] then genin I don't know yet though but
[07:17:06] we're going to do dude we're not our
[07:17:08] next stream isn't booill I'm doing
[07:17:09] another one for this [ __ ]
[07:17:14] Quest and then harm MC
[07:17:23] true and then booill and then the
[07:17:26] [ __ ] G
[07:17:28] Quest see you with Sam
[07:17:32] Sask question
[07:17:36] mark how do you know honestly I don't
[07:17:39] even know I don't even know if it's real
[07:17:41] or not but I I see I saw it on my
[07:17:43] [ __ ] feed so hopefully it's real I
[07:17:44] don't [ __ ] know we'll see I'm just
[07:17:46] going to go to bed [ __ ] you
[07:17:48] chat thanks for being here oh [ __ ] I
[07:17:51] spilled water all over
[07:17:52] myself dude I wanted to do the quest
[07:17:54] this morning I just woke up late so that
[07:17:56] was on me like I wanted to do the 2x1
[07:17:58] quest before Robin came out but in and H
[07:18:00] I should have woken up earlier or I
[07:18:01] should have probably just done Robin and
[07:18:03] then done all of 2 by1 when I could have
[07:18:05] done it one sitting but it's fine that
[07:18:07] we did half we'll just do it next time
[07:18:08] we'll finish next time then we'll do
[07:18:10] 2.2 do you like Robin oh yeah she's cool
[07:18:13] she's basically just like [ __ ] Ron
[07:18:15] May too but a bit
[07:18:22] different
[07:18:25] yeah maybe maybe next stream we'll do
[07:18:27] like uh golden gears run with her or
[07:18:29] something I don't know I kind of wanted
[07:18:31] to I mean we're going to make a second
[07:18:32] Channel video for her uh that'll be out
[07:18:34] and then for like my next like Star like
[07:18:37] full guide that should be for booill
[07:18:38] probably for like main
[07:18:44] Channel but she's very easy to build you
[07:18:46] just go like attack 117 speed and then
[07:18:48] [ __ ] random ass relics sets it
[07:18:50] doesn't matter just attack
[07:18:55] percent stop g& dude golden gears is too
[07:18:58] good
[07:19:03] ER yeah for the Rope ER rope rest is
[07:19:12] [Music]
[07:19:16] attack
[07:19:25] Robin how much speed 117 or 120 that's
[07:19:30] it if you go higher you're [ __ ]
[07:19:32] griefing usually unless you're trying to
[07:19:35] do like [ __ ] eight turns in one turn
[07:19:37] but like you probably shouldn't do
[07:19:40] that why cuz you want 134 to go twice
[07:19:43] but 134 minus the [ __ ] action Advance
[07:19:46] is 117 cuz you get action Advance
[07:19:49] here so the 117 is equals 134 basically
[07:19:54] but 120 is usually what you want for
[07:19:56] your [ __ ] Fleet or vwac or whatever
[07:19:58] the [ __ ] you're running
[07:20:02] but like most of the fight you're stuck
[07:20:03] at 90 speed so you don't actually want
[07:20:05] to build speed you just need enough for
[07:20:07] your planner that's all and to go twice
[07:20:11] in one turn you want to go twice in one
[07:20:12] turn cuz if you don't Al like cycle one
[07:20:15] like twice in first cycle cuz you don't
[07:20:17] alt in the first cycle you're a useless
[07:20:18] character well you're not useless but
[07:20:20] like you're a lot worse so you want to
[07:20:21] Al first cycle
[07:20:31] what lone there's a new freet tolay Lone
[07:20:32] that's really good I just don't know how
[07:20:33] to get it what the how the [ __ ] do you
[07:20:36] get her freet tolay lone cuz like that's
[07:20:37] one of her best options it's like five
[07:20:38] star or that I don't know how the [ __ ]
[07:20:40] to get it I just know that it's a new
[07:20:41] free to play Lon it gives a bunch of
[07:20:43] attack and [ __ ] event okay well the
[07:20:45] event is it out or do you have to wait
[07:20:48] cuz it's good for her but I just can't
[07:20:51] is it not out yet oh it's right here
[07:20:52] it's right here yeah this
[07:20:55] one you need to finish the [ __ ] story
[07:20:58] I
[07:20:59] can't yeah so you can use
[07:21:02] this either five star lone or this
[07:21:07] basically
[07:21:12] well this looks like a
[07:21:15] spoiler adult
[07:21:18] Misha all right I need to [ __ ] sleep
[07:21:21] uh next stream we'll probably do some
[07:21:22] more Robin stuff and then Quest okay and
[07:21:25] then get and stream either before or
[07:21:26] after that I'm [ __ ] tired I got to go
[07:21:29] to bed freak you chat
[07:21:31] freak you also I don't know when I'm I'm
[07:21:33] home soon so unless I stream like
[07:21:34] literally tomorrow which I might then
[07:21:36] I'll be home next stream maybe but if I
[07:21:37] stream St again tomorrow then I'll be
[07:21:39] home in two streams
