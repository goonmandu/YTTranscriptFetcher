[00:27:41] and use her play her play her teams
[00:27:44] build her build her light cone build her
[00:27:46] talents traces uh I pre-farmed but the
[00:27:49] more I think about it the more people
[00:27:50] are more stuck for 72 hours wait what
[00:27:54] oh [ __ ] wait did you change my actual
[00:27:57] oh [ __ ] yo okay first of all blade
[00:28:01] second of all

[00:28:28] chat
[00:28:30] look at her
[00:28:32] wait wait one sec one sec one sec before
[00:28:34] we before let me turn it up let me turn
[00:28:35] it up a little
[00:28:37] your mic is ass dude yeah we're on a
[00:28:40] different audio set for like two days
[00:28:41] it'll be back to normal in literally two
[00:28:42] days
[00:28:46] this is better right
[00:28:58] what the [ __ ] was that underneath
[00:29:11] this is
[00:29:14] well
[00:29:17] um
[00:29:26] okay first of all uh I love you Kafka
[00:29:28] but this is my blade team nobody touches
[00:29:30] my blade team second of all we can now
[00:29:32] make a Kafka team uh the problem with
[00:29:34] Kafka team is that you want another
[00:29:39] um
[00:29:40] okay this is like distracting okay let's
[00:29:43] talk like this uh the problem that can
[00:29:45] we do is we want another nahili
[00:29:47] character with her uh and we don't have
[00:29:49] Luca and also I prefared but I don't
[00:29:51] know if I prefarmed enough because now
[00:29:52] that I think about it we need like a lot
[00:29:54] but it's fine I I sure they have enough
[00:29:56] so
[00:29:58] yeah you have to build literally a whole
[00:30:00] team for her
[00:30:01] but
[00:30:03] surely I just got Luca here uh and we're
[00:30:06] good
[00:30:07] so we're gonna do a temple
[00:30:09] with me piloting the account
[00:30:12] and surely it will be a riveting Temple
[00:30:15] with Lucas
[00:30:21] if not we can use sampo but I don't know
[00:30:23] kind of wants to try the new character
[00:30:29] foreign
[00:30:32] oh it's all coming out now
[00:30:36] maybe that like called him and it did oh
[00:30:40] okay we got it we go we're good we're
[00:30:41] good we're good we're actually good
[00:30:42] we're actually good we're actually good
[00:30:42] we're actually good okay we got Hazel
[00:30:43] All Right Hazel boom uh nice so we got
[00:30:48] Luca
[00:30:52] pretty drippy
[00:30:55] and uh yeah
[00:30:57] cool
[00:31:03] his E2 is POG what does it do
[00:31:07] stack of fighting will
[00:31:09] wait how much wait actually
[00:31:12] 100 base chance
[00:31:15] I see
[00:31:18] okay
[00:31:22] you looking oh today so much a level
[00:31:27] why does don't say I look like a
[00:31:29] hedgehog
[00:31:31] okay so this is what our team is
[00:31:33] probably gonna be for now
[00:31:37] or we probably want a different healer
[00:31:39] actually so silver wolf works we'll
[00:31:41] probably do like
[00:31:43] probably like bailou or Natasha actually
[00:31:45] we'll see
[00:31:55] hey why is he this guy's up
[00:31:58] this guy's literally Hazel by the way
[00:32:05] so yeah
[00:32:07] um
[00:32:09] Chad do we know how much hit rate he
[00:32:11] needs if it's 100 base chance it's not
[00:32:13] 67
[00:32:15] or
[00:32:20] yeah
[00:32:22] 67. okay that's what I thought uh
[00:32:25] because Kafka doesn't need a lot at all
[00:32:27] Kafka needs almost none
[00:32:29] um assuming you unlock her things which
[00:32:31] we will uh the only thing I'm afraid of
[00:32:33] is I don't know if I have these but we
[00:32:36] should be fine so let's give her we're
[00:32:37] gonna give her her light cone
[00:32:40] fun fact this is her signature
[00:32:43] yeah so Kafka wants I think 28 and you
[00:32:46] get 18 for free which means you need
[00:32:48] another 10 ish
[00:32:50] so it's really not a lot does Captain
[00:32:52] need crit no
[00:32:55] so I already recorded the artifact The
[00:32:57] Relic part of the Kafka video you need
[00:33:00] 28 hit rate at e067 at E1 or signature
[00:33:04] lycon or both although I think you don't
[00:33:06] lose a lot of DPS if you're not 67 but
[00:33:08] usually you need 28 and you get 18 for
[00:33:11] free and you usually go attack and speed
[00:33:16] what is she doing
[00:33:18] yo she is insane
[00:33:22] there aren't dude she is a psychopath
[00:33:31] hmm
[00:33:36] um
[00:33:39] well
[00:33:41] anyways
[00:33:54] well
[00:33:56] we have 300 green ones so surely that's
[00:33:58] enough let's leveler
[00:34:05] wait we got her at what 50 pulls
[00:34:10] let me let me say thanks
[00:34:14] for Kafka haha your cosplay is so cool
[00:34:19] XD I got Luca ha ha
[00:34:26] okay
[00:34:32] Luca Tim get it because haha
[00:34:36] okay
[00:34:44] I don't get Kafka on 50 50. I am coming
[00:34:46] into your stream and spanking the [ __ ]
[00:34:49] yeah we're not listening to that
[00:34:52] hmm what was I talking about yeah so we
[00:34:55] have two um Euro polls happening today
[00:34:58] good luck
[00:35:00] all right back to sorrow
[00:35:06] thanks again okay all right we're gonna
[00:35:08] just fully Max our Kafka uh now I I auto
[00:35:13] battled four million credits I was like
[00:35:14] I'll just get more from like the battle
[00:35:15] pass and stuff right and we'll be fine
[00:35:17] and then I realized that hey maybe four
[00:35:20] million credits isn't enough so uh it's
[00:35:22] fine also something else I noticed is I
[00:35:26] didn't I wasn't really counting okay I
[00:35:28] just got I got not a hundred of these
[00:35:30] and uh we only need like [ __ ] 50 or
[00:35:33] some [ __ ] so I don't know why I got so
[00:35:35] many and no one else uses these other
[00:35:37] than genuine so we're kind of I don't
[00:35:39] know bro yeah 65. I don't know why I did
[00:35:41] 100. I was accounting I was just auto
[00:35:43] shut the [ __ ] up also we need to craft
[00:35:45] these but we have someone else we have
[00:35:46] zero blue but I have a bunch of green so
[00:35:48] we're actually fine look I'll actually
[00:35:49] find rashified no copium rocks fine no
[00:35:52] copium we're actually fine literally no
[00:35:54] copium we're probably not fine but it's
[00:35:56] it's okay we can just like make it with
[00:35:58] other stuff
[00:36:04] uh should I get her 80 yeah right
[00:36:07] because you can get this well you can
[00:36:09] get this at 75. do I need 80 or can I
[00:36:11] just go 75 because I kind of want this
[00:36:27] maybe for D.O.T
[00:36:34] [Music]
[00:36:36] [ __ ] it
[00:36:39] but that are Luca dude I need the level
[00:36:42] Luca I literally can't if I do this
[00:36:47] single pole why would I single pole
[00:36:52] who cares about Luca
[00:36:54] okay true
[00:36:56] actually that's not true
[00:36:59] oh my God we have to do everything okay
[00:37:00] well sorry the um
[00:37:04] what should I start with
[00:37:14] no books no [ __ ] okay well explain
[00:37:17] this then if I have no books yeah okay
[00:37:19] you wanna you wanna listen you wanna you
[00:37:22] wanna go there I will click this you
[00:37:23] think I won't tempt me I'll click this I
[00:37:26] will
[00:37:27] it's 160 that's still not a lot but it's
[00:37:29] a start
[00:37:30] it's a start
[00:37:36] um we have to level Luca but we'll start
[00:37:38] okay let's just gear Kafka first so for
[00:37:40] Kafka
[00:37:42] um we need to make sure she's chilling
[00:37:43] so in order to make sure she's chilling
[00:37:45] and play with some background music
[00:37:48] um
[00:37:53] in order to make sure she's chilling
[00:37:57] we're gonna level literally all of these
[00:37:59] uh torture is insane
[00:38:02] we want this
[00:38:04] Thorns is also insane it's kind of
[00:38:06] expensive but it's really really good
[00:38:09] um and then this one is some energy
[00:38:10] which we might as well get
[00:38:12] [Music]
[00:38:14] now we have to level everything except
[00:38:15] you don't really want a basic attack on
[00:38:17] Kafka if you're basic attacking you're
[00:38:18] kind of griefing but the level one to
[00:38:20] level two is really cheap so we might as
[00:38:21] well but I don't think we're gonna get
[00:38:22] it any higher uh hit rate is very good
[00:38:25] attack very good
[00:38:29] there's another hit right yeah there is
[00:38:31] yeah we'll get it
[00:38:33] I'm gonna have to craft some [ __ ] though
[00:38:34] because I kind of listen listen
[00:38:37] I get a lot of the base materials but
[00:38:40] then I don't craft them into bigger
[00:38:41] things so we're gonna have to do that
[00:38:42] together
[00:38:49] well I actually don't have any of these
[00:38:50] wait
[00:38:51] okay we're gonna grab these
[00:38:54] we'll do
[00:38:56] let's say
[00:38:58] wait no these are for Luca uh which ones
[00:39:00] I have spare
[00:39:02] I have a lot of
[00:39:04] um
[00:39:05] a lot of these spare
[00:39:07] okay we can make a lot of these we'll
[00:39:08] make a hundred
[00:39:12] and then we'll transfer them and then
[00:39:14] for the these have a [ __ ] ton of green
[00:39:15] ones so we'll make some blues so we'll
[00:39:17] make like let's say I'll keep some green
[00:39:19] so let's see like this
[00:39:22] wrong one no but we'll transfer it don't
[00:39:24] worry and then we'll make some purples
[00:39:26] 50 purples let's say or do we want no
[00:39:28] we'll do like 40 purples for now because
[00:39:30] I want to keep some blues we'll do 40
[00:39:31] purpose
[00:39:34] and then we're gonna transfer to these
[00:39:38] boom
[00:39:39] so we're losing 50 here but all good
[00:39:45] and then we'll make some purple
[00:39:49] okay let's get our at least six of
[00:39:51] everything we'll get six everything and
[00:39:52] then we'll try her and then we'll get
[00:39:53] higher
[00:39:55] wait do I actually need greens too oh my
[00:39:57] God I need greens
[00:39:58] boom
[00:40:05] all right
[00:40:08] Trace is pretty important alt is pretty
[00:40:11] important
[00:40:12] we'll just Spam click these
[00:40:20] dude there's so much to [ __ ] level
[00:40:22] okay this is good
[00:40:28] the only ones I won't get are the HP
[00:40:30] ones because we're not gonna die
[00:40:41] you don't have enough credits uh we have
[00:40:44] unlimited resin pretty much so don't
[00:40:46] worry I said I said the first hour of
[00:40:48] today's stream is gonna be
[00:40:50] prepping everything so I meant that
[00:40:52] first hour is just prepping everything
[00:40:54] so uh expect that
[00:40:56] for a little bit
[00:40:58] because we have basically unlimited
[00:41:00] resin not not because of Jades but we
[00:41:01] just saved all our fragile or whatever
[00:41:03] it's called in this game stamina
[00:41:05] uh we'll get seven seven everything and
[00:41:07] then that's a pretty decent base level
[00:41:08] to test
[00:41:10] uh and we'll get this after okay so far
[00:41:12] like that's already good
[00:41:14] now we just need to give a relics which
[00:41:16] we can do all of our relics are on
[00:41:18] serval but we can also see if there's
[00:41:20] something I missed uh but if not
[00:41:22] something like this we really want a
[00:41:23] level uh or we have uh we can take these
[00:41:26] boots as well because there's attack and
[00:41:28] speed this one also has attack and speed
[00:41:30] so we'll just level this see what we got
[00:41:35] here we got attack
[00:41:42] okay we got HP unlucky
[00:41:45] why are your TV's TVs the four piece is
[00:41:46] like literally whatever so it doesn't
[00:41:48] really matter
[00:41:50] and I am a speed enjoyer so we're gonna
[00:41:52] do two BCPS
[00:41:55] uh we're gonna give her or it's on
[00:41:56] serval or is it
[00:42:00] wait what the [ __ ] on our servo
[00:42:09] and then we should have a good
[00:42:11] yeah this one has attack speed hit rate
[00:42:21] okay cool
[00:42:31] okay that is not cool
[00:42:37] we might take our gun four piece but the
[00:42:40] only problem with the lighting set is
[00:42:41] you don't have an attack body so we're
[00:42:43] gonna have to do these two bees for now
[00:42:44] I think
[00:42:45] it says 95
[00:42:52] how did that get 95 defense we have
[00:42:55] another one it's fine we have another
[00:42:57] one uh I mean that's good but not for
[00:42:59] her this has attack
[00:43:01] this has attack and hit rate
[00:43:05] surely this is better right surely
[00:43:07] surely there's no way that this is worse
[00:43:11] there's like objectively speaking no way
[00:43:13] it rolls worse
[00:43:21] okay actually good 16 attack on a ring
[00:43:23] oh no yeah it's actually good on a hand
[00:43:25] slot actually good
[00:43:27] okay that's good
[00:43:29] um
[00:43:30] this is not bad six-speed but we want
[00:43:32] attack so we might have to go two pcbs
[00:43:34] for now
[00:43:35] because it's kind of whatever anyways
[00:43:38] um which I think we'll do
[00:43:40] yeah we're gonna do one of these pieces
[00:43:49] actually wait a second I'm using this
[00:43:51] already leveled so I don't have to waste
[00:43:52] credits for now let me filter by attack
[00:43:57] oh it's actually need just as much as
[00:43:58] you can get there's no like specific
[00:43:59] number you're going for but you just
[00:44:01] want as much as you can
[00:44:03] uh any attack body is fine here
[00:44:11] oh where's my sphere
[00:44:14] oh wait let me put my rope on first
[00:44:16] should be on serval this one we'll level
[00:44:18] this to Max
[00:44:30] our ball our sphere kind of sucks but
[00:44:32] we'll get a better one
[00:44:38] and then we'll do this and then for
[00:44:41] probably that's not actually wait what's
[00:44:43] on our serval
[00:44:50] okay we're gonna have to [ __ ] auto
[00:44:51] level all these things
[00:44:54] uh before we do
[00:44:57] something we're gonna have to do for
[00:44:58] probably 30 minutes
[00:45:01] is uh literally click here
[00:45:05] and then spend like at least 20 of these
[00:45:08] because we need Relic XP and we need
[00:45:10] credits uh we don't need these mats but
[00:45:12] we're gonna have to go through these
[00:45:14] because yeah
[00:45:16] um so we we do have a lot of fuel
[00:45:19] how I just haven't used them all
[00:45:20] leveling
[00:45:21] and I think battle pass but I didn't
[00:45:23] finish the last one
[00:45:25] but no I did finish the last one
[00:45:28] um so we have to do that quite quickly
[00:45:31] let's do that let's start with uh
[00:45:33] credits
[00:45:36] wait where the [ __ ] are credits again
[00:45:46] Pepe w
[00:45:51] you are Pepe W okay we're gonna use
[00:45:53] Kafka without Luke for now because we
[00:45:56] kind of can't so we'll just put her here
[00:45:59] um which kind of sucks
[00:46:01] but it's fine
[00:46:03] um we could also level some random
[00:46:05] pieces we'll level her rope first
[00:46:06] because this rope's actually good
[00:46:10] so let me do this
[00:46:13] I'm gonna do something dumb
[00:46:15] and throw random Pieces away that we're
[00:46:17] never gonna use like this one uh which
[00:46:19] it doesn't look that bad but we're never
[00:46:21] gonna use it we kind of value The Relic
[00:46:22] XP more right now so I don't have to
[00:46:24] waste my time
[00:46:25] so we're going to Auto add this
[00:46:29] okay that is fine
[00:46:32] for an hour 15 in a minute and then same
[00:46:35] with sphere surely we got something good
[00:46:37] when we plus three it
[00:46:39] please attack percent of speed we're
[00:46:41] good okay we got defense percent okay
[00:46:42] okay
[00:46:44] it's cool
[00:46:45] uh well Auto attack
[00:46:48] surely we'll get a better one I mean
[00:46:50] there's literally not
[00:46:52] I have other ones but
[00:46:55] I mean hit rate's fine no it's not even
[00:46:57] fine unless you get her E1
[00:47:03] I have other ones but
[00:47:09] dude am I gonna be a [ __ ] filthy
[00:47:11] ageless player
[00:47:15] ew I might actually be an ageless player
[00:47:18] um
[00:47:20] you
[00:47:22] yeah well
[00:47:27] surely we got attack
[00:47:29] Ed we didn't get attacked okay this game
[00:47:30] is actually [ __ ] this game is
[00:47:33] this game is has to be like
[00:47:35] this game has to be discriminating fine
[00:47:37] okay sound good
[00:47:38] yeah no we won't
[00:47:44] what's wrong with ageless it's it's okay
[00:47:46] dude what the [ __ ] is happening
[00:47:49] well
[00:47:50] you know what it's okay we have other
[00:47:51] spheres I have a lot I got a lot I just
[00:47:53] didn't level it's fine we have others oh
[00:47:55] there's no others we literally have
[00:47:56] others
[00:47:58] well this one has no sub stats uh but
[00:48:00] surely there's one of the subs that's
[00:48:01] somewhere I'm not gonna use a four star
[00:48:03] wait what other circuit are you done the
[00:48:05] hit reset I probably don't have
[00:48:06] lightning on it
[00:48:08] might do
[00:48:10] okay now we don't well we'll just use
[00:48:13] we'll just use this for now [ __ ] it
[00:48:15] isn't attack better no not for the
[00:48:17] sphere attack's better for the body
[00:48:20] but not for sphere
[00:48:27] oh that we should probably level this
[00:48:37] we could also use two pieces of this for
[00:48:39] now but these sub stats suck so we
[00:48:40] probably shouldn't use this one
[00:48:52] one sec chat
[00:48:57] all right Paul strap surely We Roll
[00:49:00] attack
[00:49:02] surely sorry my voice didn't crack you
[00:49:04] cracked what oh my God we got why did we
[00:49:07] get flat attack did flat attack is so
[00:49:10] bad I don't know why am I leveling this
[00:49:12] I mean we don't want to leave it at 13.
[00:49:14] no that looks ugly we have to [ __ ]
[00:49:15] plus 20 at 15 it
[00:49:19] flow attack is so bad dude because we
[00:49:21] have so much attack on her that Vlad
[00:49:23] gives you nothing okay that's good I
[00:49:26] mean 10 attack is good
[00:49:29] okay well
[00:49:32] uh I just need to level our body now but
[00:49:34] body you just want main style mostly so
[00:49:37] it is what it is surely we can't nothing
[00:49:39] can go wrong here
[00:49:43] but we might have to Auto Battle for
[00:49:44] some artifact uh some Relic XP do I have
[00:49:46] enough uh I might actually if I throw
[00:49:49] something away
[00:49:51] like I don't need this I'm never gonna
[00:49:53] use that did mother come home yet Mr
[00:49:55] socks smile yeah we'll just add on this
[00:49:57] oops
[00:49:58] did mother come home yeah yeah we have
[00:50:00] Kafka
[00:50:01] is gonna suck but the only thing you
[00:50:03] want on a body is like speed
[00:50:05] that's fine
[00:50:08] pittery would be fine too but I don't
[00:50:10] think we're gonna hit right
[00:50:15] we're just gonna [ __ ] roll defense or
[00:50:16] something watch
[00:50:19] yeah
[00:50:20] that's fine all right whatever she's
[00:50:22] decent enough wait no she's not I don't
[00:50:24] have an agent wait where's my ageless
[00:50:26] uh I'll switch to uh we'll use this
[00:50:28] round I'll switch to internet uh space
[00:50:29] ceiling station in a little but we're
[00:50:31] gonna use ages for now until uh yeah so
[00:50:34] she's like usable now and then we just
[00:50:36] have to make a team for her so in order
[00:50:39] to do that
[00:50:41] in order to be able to have a team for
[00:50:43] her we have to do uh
[00:50:46] credits and XP quickly I thought I had
[00:50:49] enough but I don't so we can level Luca
[00:50:51] as well so I'm gonna do that
[00:50:53] very quickly
[00:50:55] so that we can love a Luca because Kafka
[00:50:57] shouldn't really be played Without
[00:50:58] remains others
[00:51:01] um
[00:51:02] dot characters usually
[00:51:13] [Music]
[00:51:16] I appreciate it sorry I was focused
[00:51:21] wait I want to see calcasults
[00:51:25] we don't have it nevermind I don't know
[00:51:26] what audible is doing which is normal
[00:51:27] attack on Capcom
[00:51:33] wait let me do it here
[00:51:36] ready chat
[00:51:38] try to turn also I'll turn on slow mo
[00:51:48] dude that's so sick
[00:51:51] boom
[00:51:58] divinity
[00:52:04] you want our light cone it depends on
[00:52:06] your other options if you have good
[00:52:08] night sleep well especially with uh
[00:52:10] super positions go for you one okay
[00:52:13] if you're if your other icons are dog
[00:52:15] [ __ ] her like one's better but if you
[00:52:17] have a good like already we're gonna use
[00:52:18] our feel today by the way we're using
[00:52:20] like I use like two at a time
[00:52:22] um uh but yeah if you I saw over 160 I
[00:52:25] thought I capped because of [ __ ]
[00:52:26] engine but if not then you can go for
[00:52:28] Elon
[00:52:31] there's a lot like unusual yeah well
[00:52:33] like one's about as good as a free to
[00:52:34] play one they're like very close so it's
[00:52:36] like not like if you have it leveled
[00:52:38] already use it it's not it's not really
[00:52:40] worth leveling for Kafka
[00:52:47] time to say bye
[00:52:50] what about fermata that's a pretty flat
[00:52:52] one it's good
[00:52:56] night sleep well at S1 is about as good
[00:53:00] as the free to play fermata S5 and then
[00:53:02] at S5
[00:53:04] well it's like the best by far well in
[00:53:07] terms of four stars it's worse than her
[00:53:08] signature but not by too much it's like
[00:53:11] a few percents
[00:53:12] and because it's only a few percent
[00:53:14] behind that means that at that point you
[00:53:16] don't really want to pull for her
[00:53:17] signature
[00:53:25] 's okay yeah that was the fun Packers
[00:53:28] speed are fun
[00:53:32] okay
[00:53:33] time to do some XP books uh just so we
[00:53:36] can level Luca because playing Kafka
[00:53:37] without a Kafka team is kind of griefing
[00:53:39] so don't look at our Kafka yet she's
[00:53:41] just here to be pretty uh and she'll
[00:53:44] actually start doing well once we pair
[00:53:45] her with other noility characters which
[00:53:47] we're about to do I just thought I had
[00:53:49] enough XP but I don't so we're gonna go
[00:53:51] do that
[00:53:53] foreign
[00:54:04] yes
[00:54:07] boom
[00:54:16] yeah usually when you play Kafka you run
[00:54:19] her with either sample or Luca or serval
[00:54:22] and then you run usually you can run two
[00:54:25] other dots but usually you do uh defense
[00:54:27] shredding or resistance trading support
[00:54:28] so it'll do like pilaf or silver wolf
[00:54:32] and then you pair her with Kafka and
[00:54:35] then you have a good like death tread
[00:54:36] and then you can run another dot
[00:54:38] character and then your lasso's usually
[00:54:39] like a Healer or Jeff hard or something
[00:54:41] ah stand still
[00:54:43] savor it for me
[00:54:47] time to say bye
[00:54:49] someone said Sniper Wolf question mark
[00:54:52] surely that's a band
[00:54:55] oh yeah Aston works too I forgot about
[00:54:57] Austin works really well with her too
[00:54:59] because the speed buff that's true yeah
[00:55:04] it's gonna be attack which is nice
[00:55:06] and can break and with cow you can do
[00:55:09] some break things with Kafka but so I
[00:55:11] don't know okay this
[00:55:12] okay everyone and their mother
[00:55:15] break effect but no one wants to be
[00:55:17] crafted but from my understanding of
[00:55:18] break effect you don't want to build it
[00:55:20] on Kafka but you would if you want to go
[00:55:23] break you go break on another character
[00:55:25] alongside your Kafka so your Kafka can
[00:55:28] stack like attack and [ __ ] and then your
[00:55:29] other character can go breaks if you
[00:55:31] want so you can have like a serval on
[00:55:32] break or like Asta or whoever the [ __ ]
[00:55:35] but I could be wrong about that because
[00:55:37] I don't actually know
[00:55:44] your end approaches
[00:55:50] repay
[00:55:54] time to say bye
[00:56:00] or you could just not build the break
[00:56:01] effect and stop coping true okay true
[00:56:10] received divinity
[00:56:16] but if you do want to go break you can
[00:56:19] with Kafka but you would want it and I
[00:56:21] from what I understand you would want it
[00:56:24] on another character who's your
[00:56:25] dedicated breaker
[00:56:26] because then your Capital can still
[00:56:28] build attack and [ __ ]
[00:56:29] and then you can have another character
[00:56:31] on that
[00:56:43] Henry do you want really not a lot at e0
[00:56:45] you want like 10 uh you want 28 total
[00:56:48] you get 18 for free so 10 more
[00:56:51] and then E1 at six seven
[00:56:54] okay uh hopefully this is enough XP
[00:56:56] after this because I don't feel like
[00:56:58] Auto battling anymore
[00:57:02] starrell moment
[00:57:08] truly for the next character I will be
[00:57:10] fully prepared right press one if that
[00:57:13] is true and not a lie all right Luca
[00:57:17] Mr Lucas don't type two shut the dude
[00:57:20] listen I okay I also was gonna do the
[00:57:23] museum event
[00:57:24] expired so I missed a lot of
[00:57:26] a lot of just shut the [ __ ] up I don't
[00:57:28] want to talk to you guys right now I
[00:57:29] don't want to talk to you guys okay I
[00:57:31] don't want to talk to you guys I was
[00:57:32] also playing cafcon in Asia account so I
[00:57:34] didn't I was like testing her but I
[00:57:36] didn't get to like I I didn't get the
[00:57:38] user on my but it's fine just it is what
[00:57:40] it is
[00:57:41] it is what it is
[00:57:45] I need more XP bucks
[00:57:49] that event was fun no the [ __ ] it wasn't
[00:57:53] that event was not fun
[00:58:03] it was okay I I did like I did like
[00:58:07] a bit more than half of it it was okay
[00:58:10] it was as long as [ __ ] it wasn't
[00:58:13] it wasn't like not fun but it wasn't fun
[00:58:16] it was like whatever but it took so long
[00:58:19] two
[00:58:21] time to say bye it was the best event in
[00:58:24] the game yeah maybe because stereo has
[00:58:25] gotten literally like one event wow
[00:58:28] you're getting a boxing ring and fight
[00:58:30] [ __ ] shampoo
[00:58:34] we have not gotten a real event
[00:58:39] we got the boxing ring we got like
[00:58:42] yeah
[00:58:47] Chad this is a blade team not a Kafka
[00:58:50] team
[00:58:52] [Applause]
[00:58:56] return
[00:59:04] you're talking as if there was an event
[00:59:07] you'd play dude I do play events what
[00:59:09] are you talking about
[00:59:10] I literally play events
[00:59:16] time to save my eye
[00:59:20] I may have missed one or two but it is
[00:59:22] what it is
[00:59:25] divinity
[00:59:31] savor it for me
[00:59:37] so instead he plays events like he's in
[00:59:39] a survival horror what the [ __ ] does
[00:59:41] that mean what the [ __ ] does that mean
[00:59:46] what the [ __ ] does what does that even
[00:59:48] mean by the way by the way what does
[00:59:50] that even mean
[00:59:55] time to say bye
[00:59:58] boom dude just wait give me like give me
[01:00:01] literally 20 minutes our calf is gonna
[01:00:04] be cracked it's 2 20 p.m right now at 2
[01:00:07] 42 No 2 44 because it's an even number
[01:00:10] our calf is gonna be insane just wait
[01:00:12] just literally wait literally 22 minutes
[01:00:15] 24 minutes
[01:00:17] okay let's level Lucas a little bit more
[01:00:20] so we can actually build them
[01:00:24] honestly 70 out of 80 is probably fine I
[01:00:26] know 80 helps like guilty and [ __ ] but
[01:00:28] 70.80 should be fine for now
[01:00:31] just for now just for now
[01:00:34] um
[01:00:35] yeah I don't have the best light cone
[01:00:37] but we'll give him the one with his back
[01:00:39] I know he can build him more damage
[01:00:41] focused and give him a better light cone
[01:00:43] for that but this one is literally him
[01:00:45] with a naked back so why wouldn't you
[01:00:47] use it true that is a good take
[01:00:50] um well it's like on 79 doesn't matter
[01:00:52] so yeah uh back actually I might as well
[01:00:55] get this to 80 just to actually do I
[01:00:57] even have I don't okay let's not talk
[01:00:58] about it
[01:00:59] all right where's Luca
[01:01:02] um
[01:01:03] the thing the only thing I have to
[01:01:04] disclose with Luca is I get you DLT and
[01:01:08] you punch and you get like Stacks but I
[01:01:10] don't actually know how to play I know
[01:01:11] to play Kafka I know how to build Kafka
[01:01:13] I know how to rotation Kafka I haven't
[01:01:15] actually read uh Lucas traces yet so
[01:01:18] we're gonna have to do that
[01:01:19] um
[01:01:21] and I don't feel like it but it's okay
[01:01:27] Luca needs to Pan the camera down on his
[01:01:30] light cone
[01:01:34] uh
[01:01:36] uh my skills using melee to spell one
[01:01:37] buff from enemy
[01:01:39] targets apply one additional hit okay
[01:01:41] okay let me read what the actual skills
[01:01:44] do I like it on this menu it looks
[01:01:46] cleaner
[01:01:48] so he's a visit act or skill he gets one
[01:01:51] stack Stacks up to four times one is two
[01:01:52] or more it's enhanced okay it's just
[01:01:54] like blade okay bleed and then okay cool
[01:01:57] ultimate okay
[01:02:00] okay and then skill okay and then 100
[01:02:03] for bleeds he wants 67 hit rate probably
[01:02:05] okay
[01:02:10] all right we're ready
[01:02:14] wait if I actually want that much hit
[01:02:16] rate surely I just go this for now then
[01:02:17] this is Plus 40.
[01:02:20] wait what's happening in the background
[01:02:29] this is also pretty cracked but
[01:02:36] all right let's level everything do I
[01:02:38] have enough I know probably not
[01:02:41] laughs
[01:02:57] do not even dude we just want six six on
[01:03:00] everything
[01:03:02] I have a lot of the green mats we can
[01:03:03] just make blue ones it should be fine
[01:03:04] honestly as long as everything I can get
[01:03:06] to six you should be chilling
[01:03:09] uh plus energy sure we'll take that
[01:03:13] this one
[01:03:15] sure we'll take that this one that looks
[01:03:18] really good
[01:03:22] it was really good too
[01:03:24] hit rate we take those
[01:03:27] so let's add a broke arm why are you
[01:03:30] making fun of my star rail financial
[01:03:32] status that is actually [ __ ] up that
[01:03:35] is [ __ ] up for you to make fun of my
[01:03:37] star rail financial situation okay
[01:03:41] wait dude we literally getting dude look
[01:03:44] at this
[01:03:45] hello zaj [ __ ] today uh disagree but
[01:03:51] soon
[01:03:54] we'll get like I don't know how many
[01:03:55] purples I need start with this hit rate
[01:03:57] really good on him do I need more or
[01:03:59] will I have enough on my relics
[01:04:01] uh we need 67 I could go for the light
[01:04:05] cone that's 40 or I could go for a body
[01:04:07] do I have a light uh headrate body other
[01:04:09] than silver wolves probably not
[01:04:11] but we could go like
[01:04:14] even though the break effect set for now
[01:04:15] until I get a better one
[01:04:17] because I know you can go the physical
[01:04:18] set and build them like
[01:04:21] but we probably just want a stalker Dot
[01:04:27] yeah we might just go hit rate
[01:04:32] okay yeah
[01:04:34] okay in that case we need to level the
[01:04:36] trace
[01:04:41] bro don't hold my sub three times in a
[01:04:43] row dude what are you talking about
[01:04:46] near that end of the 19 months dude
[01:04:48] where oh I should I actually did that
[01:04:50] okay there's a 15. I appreciate it
[01:04:54] hey Mr future lawyer I have a question
[01:04:56] can I legally declare myself as kafka's
[01:04:58] property also in Canada at least in what
[01:05:01] I'm studying in civil law uh there is a
[01:05:03] something called squatters rights I
[01:05:05] believe it's called where if you stay in
[01:05:07] like let's say there's like a house and
[01:05:08] like you don't actually live there but
[01:05:10] you stay there for a certain period of
[01:05:11] time after a few years it just like you
[01:05:14] just have a right to it and then you
[01:05:16] it's like your prop like I don't know if
[01:05:17] it's your property it's been a while
[01:05:18] this is like first year first class
[01:05:20] first semester it's been a while but you
[01:05:22] get like eventually it becomes your
[01:05:24] property at some point it's after quite
[01:05:26] a bit of years though so if you wanna I
[01:05:29] don't know if you have Kafka for long
[01:05:31] enough maybe
[01:05:43] boom
[01:05:44] [Music]
[01:05:47] okay this should be enough or not I mean
[01:05:51] we can level more but I want to save
[01:05:52] some of my masks for Kafka
[01:05:57] dude zaja what the [ __ ] are you typing
[01:06:02] what I'm not even reading that
[01:06:08] what is a prime
[01:06:13] all right so I think we can start
[01:06:14] playing a Kafka team where she doesn't
[01:06:16] look bad
[01:06:17] um because she looks good
[01:06:19] uh the only thing is we need some
[01:06:21] artifact Relic not artifact no artifact
[01:06:24] I hate Genji players this is star rail
[01:06:27] but in order to do that we need to get a
[01:06:29] little bit of Relic XP to throw in so we
[01:06:31] can do simulated universe or we could do
[01:06:35] um
[01:06:35] um some some normal Relic farming I
[01:06:37] think we could do a simulated Universe
[01:06:39] run but first
[01:06:42] um actually yeah first we'll do
[01:06:44] well we'll do a path of Holy hymn
[01:06:52] wait actually
[01:06:57] team full
[01:07:00] Jesus Christ man you woke up by
[01:07:01] neighbors okay that's on you for having
[01:07:03] the volume that loud there is no way
[01:07:06] that my volume hits your neighbors
[01:07:08] [ __ ] is in your neighbor's hit range
[01:07:11] there's no way it hit their hitbox
[01:07:16] so what did I need to level these more
[01:07:17] is these sure they have enough right
[01:07:20] okay I don't oh yeah I do
[01:07:25] yeah I can make like one thing
[01:07:28] I really want to level this
[01:07:31] wait how much hitter do you have do I
[01:07:33] have 28
[01:07:36] oh I do okay we're good on here right
[01:07:37] all right we're fine
[01:07:42] and then we want to go into itself so I
[01:07:44] mean space stealing not Fleet of Ages
[01:07:46] but we can use ages for now until we get
[01:07:48] a good space stealing
[01:07:52] yeah
[01:07:54] yeah
[01:08:00] Envy has five more attack than you dude
[01:08:02] shut the [ __ ] up literally literally
[01:08:04] literally shut the [ __ ] up
[01:08:09] uh uh okay
[01:08:12] how do we want to do how do we want to
[01:08:14] do Luca I think we go we go with the
[01:08:16] normal like
[01:08:17] build the normal dot build right which
[01:08:19] is just like hit rate attack speed I
[01:08:22] know there's like crit Luca build but I
[01:08:23] think we're just gonna go D.O.T because
[01:08:24] Kafka and that's how it scales so I
[01:08:26] think we do
[01:08:29] um okay [ __ ] you pillow no one asked
[01:08:31] that was kind of toxic I'm sorry
[01:08:35] um
[01:08:40] at Vox Envy has more friends than you
[01:08:42] okay well
[01:08:43] that is that is [ __ ] up
[01:08:47] if we do this then our team Yoon gets
[01:08:49] [ __ ] over but I don't think we're
[01:08:50] playing team today so I think it's fine
[01:08:52] rip Bozo Ting Yoon no we want physical
[01:08:55] damage what am I doing never mind
[01:08:57] I don't know why I clicked attack I'm
[01:08:58] dumb
[01:08:59] uh
[01:09:01] uh how do I filter we go here we go main
[01:09:03] stat we go
[01:09:05] physical
[01:09:11] I want this set that's not bad it has
[01:09:14] attack percent that sucks that also
[01:09:16] sucks
[01:09:20] this could be good too
[01:09:31] this is also about as good
[01:09:34] because we're getting basically the same
[01:09:36] amount of attack with both of these
[01:09:40] okay we'll level this one
[01:09:45] foreign
[01:09:49] I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot I
[01:09:52] actually forgore it's fine we have
[01:09:53] something leveled we can throw away all
[01:09:55] good all good I'm never gonna use these
[01:09:57] I'm oh there's actually not bad never
[01:09:59] mind I'm never gonna use this I am never
[01:10:01] in my life going to use this it's fine
[01:10:03] it's all good it's actually all good
[01:10:05] it's actually all good press one if it's
[01:10:07] all good because I think it's all good
[01:10:09] boom plus nine
[01:10:13] why is no one pressing one
[01:10:15] this is actually not even bad hitter
[01:10:17] rate's really good we're actually fine
[01:10:18] Rush fun okay so far so good boom so
[01:10:21] that's a ball we now have a ball uh rope
[01:10:23] we're okay here's what we're gonna do we
[01:10:25] are going to do just sub stats for now
[01:10:28] and then we'll put a good set on him
[01:10:29] when we can afford to do so everyone
[01:10:32] agree I agree
[01:10:35] thanks for agreeing with me chat
[01:10:40] hit rate is good for now
[01:10:44] I don't think no
[01:10:48] this is better than we [ __ ] over which
[01:10:50] I don't really want to do
[01:10:52] but Lucha doesn't even need that much
[01:10:54] healing because he has Overkill so we
[01:10:55] can low-key yoink it from him
[01:10:58] and then just give him whatever
[01:11:01] um
[01:11:07] I've been attack body levels not level
[01:11:09] one
[01:11:17] then we want a nice rope which we can do
[01:11:22] here boom
[01:11:26] okay
[01:11:27] now we need a lot more attack our attack
[01:11:30] is very low right now but for now this
[01:11:33] should be fine until we get a little bit
[01:11:35] more XP but we're gonna do that as I
[01:11:37] said
[01:11:38] for the first like 30 minutes so
[01:11:40] should be fine for now uh do I want to
[01:11:44] take blade out of this team not really
[01:11:51] but we can
[01:11:55] wait chat can Auto Battle play a DOT
[01:11:58] team or are we just gonna die
[01:12:00] I have never I have only played this
[01:12:03] team manually
[01:12:04] can Auto Battle play this team or are we
[01:12:06] [ __ ]
[01:12:10] you're gonna die
[01:12:12] only one way to find out okay well I do
[01:12:16] not like the sound of that
[01:12:18] was our body plus zero
[01:12:21] you know what I'm gonna go the healing
[01:12:22] light cone because I don't really trust
[01:12:24] anything that's happening so
[01:12:31] we could actually just use Bilo
[01:12:36] no he's by the here
[01:12:40] it's Auto Battle okay we'll Auto Battle
[01:12:48] actually wait let me let me figure out
[01:12:50] the rotation of this team first because
[01:12:52] I actually need to figure out how Luca
[01:12:53] works I know how Kafka works but Luca I
[01:12:55] don't fully know
[01:12:56] yo can you chill why am I dying okay
[01:12:59] it's fine I need to figure out how the
[01:13:01] [ __ ] Luca works so
[01:13:03] we probably want to skill instantly and
[01:13:05] then that enhances us
[01:13:08] wait no it has this from this
[01:13:12] so basically got our skill you up one
[01:13:15] stack then we have
[01:13:16] two sacks or more you get enhanced but
[01:13:18] truly is another way to get yeah you can
[01:13:20] alter two
[01:13:23] okay
[01:13:28] and then bleed is on
[01:13:31] wait this reduces
[01:13:33] increase damage received so debuffs done
[01:13:35] basically and then bleed is on the
[01:13:38] normal attack
[01:13:39] wait no on the skill I lied yeah yeah I
[01:13:41] got yeah leads on the skill or on
[01:13:46] yeah
[01:13:49] okay I see
[01:13:58] wait why is my cam bottom left this is
[01:14:00] like here
[01:14:01] wait I
[01:14:04] yeah okay
[01:14:09] okay I think I see what you're supposed
[01:14:10] to do
[01:14:14] okay
[01:14:15] I mean I think he's supposed to alt
[01:14:17] right but we don't have our Alt
[01:14:22] right that was a wrong cup but I have
[01:14:24] two cups on my desk fine
[01:14:27] debate
[01:14:33] wait what are you supposed to do against
[01:14:34] multiple targets Luca I guess just alt
[01:14:37] right
[01:14:39] probably should do the trial here
[01:14:42] oh yeah no never mind this doesn't do
[01:14:44] [ __ ] it's a single this is just single
[01:14:45] Target
[01:14:48] all doesn't do anything
[01:14:52] what about basic attacks I mean enhanced
[01:14:54] basics
[01:14:58] sample and AOE yeah that makes sense
[01:15:08] I already leveled blue I mean hard
[01:15:11] content's just a boss right so surely so
[01:15:13] surely it's fine
[01:15:15] well I want to see how much I do to this
[01:15:17] guy so we'll do this
[01:15:19] okay yeah it basically doubles the dot
[01:15:21] damage I mean obviously the dot wasn't
[01:15:22] much because our Luca is like half
[01:15:23] geared but okay good to know
[01:15:30] oh
[01:15:33] okay I'm just I'm just thinking right
[01:15:35] now okay I mean let me just keep talking
[01:15:40] uh it doesn't really matter what we do
[01:15:42] here
[01:15:49] I kind of wish we love old sampo over
[01:15:51] Luca but it's fine
[01:15:54] all right
[01:15:56] don't look so good
[01:15:59] thanks you're too good to me
[01:16:04] he's gonna die I'm not gonna die I let
[01:16:07] me let me let me cook I'm still thunking
[01:16:09] thoughts okay
[01:16:10] you took the bait
[01:16:14] stand still
[01:16:16] may as well kill them all
[01:16:21] you're too good to me
[01:16:25] okay
[01:16:30] we'll take damage here all good
[01:16:32] let's try using Luca all now to actually
[01:16:34] make him useful so we're gonna alt uh
[01:16:37] we'll start with silver wolf
[01:16:40] this guy
[01:16:45] then we're gonna ult this guy
[01:16:50] dude this guy is a [ __ ] Fister okay
[01:16:52] let me do this
[01:16:54] apply a bleed wait no please from the
[01:16:56] skill
[01:16:59] oh I know Alto right wait is he bleeding
[01:17:02] okay no he's shock though which is fine
[01:17:05] but we should uh well I didn't have a
[01:17:06] skill point
[01:17:07] okay noted
[01:17:12] okay
[01:17:22] yeah
[01:17:24] oh he is bleeding
[01:17:27] or is that just the same icon for
[01:17:28] everything
[01:17:29] and I was just shocked okay nevermind
[01:17:30] I'm lied
[01:17:34] okay make sense
[01:17:36] okay I'm understanding
[01:17:44] although we do this and now we should
[01:17:45] bleed
[01:17:46] yeah okay yeah bleed is that icon uh
[01:17:52] uh we don't have enough skill points to
[01:17:53] Silver Wolf here which is unfortunate
[01:17:55] now this should deal more bleed damage
[01:17:58] to him
[01:18:00] yeah oh my God okay okay that actually
[01:18:02] makes sense now okay okay cool
[01:18:06] yeah cap code is so much more when you
[01:18:08] actually like when you're actually like
[01:18:11] yeah I kind of want sample we'll see I
[01:18:13] might level them
[01:18:24] foreign
[01:18:35] on the day of release that were like
[01:18:37] level sample level seven they're gonna
[01:18:39] be right then they'll be like told you
[01:18:40] so you should have listened to us a year
[01:18:42] ago you should have leveled that but
[01:18:43] when the game came out
[01:18:46] boom
[01:18:49] yeah she kafka's damaged like [ __ ]
[01:18:51] quadrupled
[01:18:53] if you play with a DOT character
[01:19:03] is all about this is no matter
[01:19:15] what's a DOT uh damage over time so like
[01:19:19] bleed wind shear shock it's um like
[01:19:22] devopsy upon enemies
[01:19:24] wow this was terrible at least it's XP
[01:19:26] though
[01:19:33] wait speaking of which I could use my
[01:19:35] five star relics to like level [ __ ] but
[01:19:37] I kind of want to salvage them for the
[01:19:38] strong box I don't know what is smarter
[01:19:40] probably XP but I kind of want a strong
[01:19:42] box suddenly we have
[01:19:44] foreign
[01:19:53] I did pre-farm and like not quite enough
[01:19:56] I was pre-forming and then I said [ __ ]
[01:19:58] this and I farmed Luca instead so we're
[01:20:00] gonna use Luca today but just know that
[01:20:02] maybe next stream we'll have sample
[01:20:04] leveled okay not right now not right now
[01:20:06] but maybe at some point
[01:20:09] it's not even I don't even know anymore
[01:20:11] it's it's two plus five plus fifteen
[01:20:13] which I have all of that and then we
[01:20:15] need like 28 more
[01:20:24] all right
[01:20:26] one day
[01:20:38] you said you have Infinite Energy we do
[01:20:40] basically have unlimited stamina right
[01:20:42] now
[01:20:47] I'm trying to figure out how I'm
[01:20:49] supposed to be playing this
[01:20:54] because we want to be applying bleed
[01:20:56] right that's what we want to do but in
[01:20:57] order to do bleed we want a skill
[01:21:07] wait but is there no other way to put
[01:21:09] bleed on an enemy
[01:21:10] is it literally just your skill
[01:21:14] and technique but yeah
[01:21:20] and yeah I guess break too yeah break as
[01:21:23] well
[01:21:24] because
[01:21:27] wait is sample more skill efficient
[01:21:28] because don't you enhance with him
[01:21:34] hi Mr socks how are you today
[01:21:39] or no do you still spam
[01:21:43] this hits four [ __ ] times
[01:21:47] yeah I know you still skill right
[01:21:48] because this is four times
[01:21:53] but he applies with you on basic as well
[01:21:55] yeah
[01:21:58] basic it's three
[01:22:04] okay we're gonna I think I think we'll
[01:22:07] be fine
[01:22:18] we're gonna level our old because it
[01:22:19] looks cool
[01:22:21] and that is how I play this game all
[01:22:24] right okay
[01:22:25] I think we're good I think we're good I
[01:22:26] think we're good
[01:22:28] um or Luca has
[01:22:30] borderline too much speed
[01:22:32] uh To Where I Wanna Go attack just to
[01:22:35] make him attackier if that makes sense
[01:22:37] if that doesn't make sense
[01:22:39] then ratio
[01:22:54] okay
[01:22:55] that's what we're gonna do
[01:23:00] we need a relic XP so in order to do
[01:23:02] that before I do forgot haul or anything
[01:23:04] we're gonna do memory uh I mean yeah
[01:23:06] before we do that we're gonna do
[01:23:08] simulated universe
[01:23:10] which is in the [ __ ] hurt a space
[01:23:12] station
[01:23:14] because
[01:23:15] we need Relic XP and civilian universe
[01:23:17] is fun so we're gonna do that
[01:23:21] keep in mind we might get [ __ ] star
[01:23:23] railed we might get [ __ ]
[01:23:25] but I think it'll be okay
[01:23:29] um how much it right do I have I need
[01:23:32] like a lot more
[01:23:34] Actually I don't even need that much
[01:23:35] more
[01:23:36] because he only had 67 okay we're
[01:23:38] actually fine for now okay we're
[01:23:39] actually we're actually chilling
[01:23:42] okay yeah we're actually fine uh I need
[01:23:45] more attack on him though so that my
[01:23:46] bleed actually does damage in order to
[01:23:48] get attacked
[01:23:53] yo chat is it actually
[01:23:55] dude surely it's worse to just throw
[01:23:56] five stars right surely salvaging them
[01:23:59] salvaging 10 to get one bad Relic isn't
[01:24:02] worth right surely
[01:24:05] objectively speaking
[01:24:11] there is no way ten to one is better
[01:24:13] than all this XP
[01:24:24] wait what do I okay what do I get if I
[01:24:25] just Salvage it
[01:24:27] let's see let's just Salvage one
[01:24:31] that's it you don't get any XP you just
[01:24:33] get 10 [ __ ] Relic remains
[01:24:43] strawbox is Gamba which I like
[01:24:52] you Max refresh no the [ __ ] I don't I
[01:24:55] literally rarely I haven't ever Max
[01:24:58] refreshed first of all second of all
[01:25:00] when I do refresh it's on stream and
[01:25:02] it's like four or three it's not even a
[01:25:05] lot it's a streamer I just wanted to say
[01:25:08] thank you for being my comfort for the
[01:25:10] past month how am I comforting but I
[01:25:13] appreciate that appreciate it love you
[01:25:26] okay I'm Gonna Save most of my five star
[01:25:28] Alex but before we do the simulator run
[01:25:30] I'm gonna use some to level a little bit
[01:25:32] because I don't want our damage to look
[01:25:33] dog [ __ ] because then people be like wow
[01:25:36] ziox you suck and I do but it's fine so
[01:25:39] we're gonna get this to at least uh 12.
[01:25:44] yeah I really don't have enough [ __ ]
[01:25:46] where's those
[01:25:52] so we'll get this to 12.
[01:25:54] cred damage is uh not really good here
[01:25:57] but it's fine
[01:25:59] and then
[01:26:02] this is really important to level this
[01:26:03] we should probably level ASAP ASAP
[01:26:05] rather why do people say ASAP when a-fap
[01:26:08] is better a-fap is as fast as possible
[01:26:10] which makes more sense than as soon as
[01:26:12] possible and also it sounds funnier so
[01:26:15] why would you say ASAP instead of afap I
[01:26:18] don't get it also I kind of want to
[01:26:19] throw in my genuine ball it sucks but I
[01:26:20] don't have a better one so I don't know
[01:26:22] what to do about it
[01:26:33] Chad I am broke on XP you actually don't
[01:26:35] understand
[01:26:39] oh
[01:26:42] me go to sdfu or fap

[01:27:11] what what are you implying here what are

[01:27:19] thank you very much thank you very much
[01:27:21] I don't I literally do not
[01:27:29] okay okay I've accepted that our genuine
[01:27:31] is is actually like not even playable so
[01:27:33] we're gonna throw this away for now
[01:27:34] because this is I am never using this in
[01:27:36] my life I would rather I would rather
[01:27:38] just not play the character
[01:27:41] maybe like socks why are you doing this
[01:27:43] you're like dumb I know okay Desperate
[01:27:45] Times Desperate Measures
[01:27:47] wow literally can't even 15 this I'd
[01:27:49] have to use five stars okay fine these
[01:27:52] are the last five species we'll save the
[01:27:53] rest for uh [ __ ] strongbox
[01:28:00] okay that was well all right we're ready
[01:28:03] so wait what the [ __ ] happened
[01:28:08] okay
[01:28:10] uh
[01:28:13] I really should
[01:28:17] I really should 90 this 80 this guy but
[01:28:20] it's fine
[01:28:22] and then our Kafka is going to be on
[01:28:23] this S3
[01:28:26] and
[01:28:28] we only want attack boots so I'm gonna
[01:28:30] be honest I don't think I want speed
[01:28:31] boots here
[01:28:40] but it's fine
[01:28:51] pull kafka's light cone no
[01:28:53] stop it bad
[01:28:56] chatter resist the urge resist
[01:28:59] temptation
[01:29:01] rise above it
[01:29:04] you are better than that
[01:29:08] you do not need to pull just a few
[01:29:11] things
[01:29:13] be better be stronger be smarter
[01:29:19] pulling is not the answer
[01:29:22] pulling is not the way
[01:29:32] please I don't keep using five stars
[01:29:34] just [ __ ] okay 12.
[01:29:36] okay
[01:29:39] this is actually really good uh no it's
[01:29:41] not that's a fact I thought that was hit
[01:29:42] rate I mean four speed is whatever okay
[01:29:44] it doesn't matter wait this is even 12.
[01:29:45] am I dumb
[01:29:50] speed okay oh
[01:29:53] all right
[01:30:02] how do I lose a [ __ ] headpiece
[01:30:07] 3K attack one two three speed
[01:30:11] Kafka wants three it won't be 134 but
[01:30:13] that's her memory account it's fine for
[01:30:14] [ __ ] simulator universe
[01:30:18] um but we do need a little bit more
[01:30:19] speed so we're gonna try to get a
[01:30:21] lightning
[01:30:22] we want to go space ceiling station okay
[01:30:24] we're gonna Farm now
[01:30:27] Kafka time we're gonna do world three
[01:30:28] let me abandon this run
[01:30:39] level 4b's Quantum on Kafka it's fine
[01:30:43] it you ignored offense for like the
[01:30:45] first part of the four piece it's fine
[01:30:46] Kafka doesn't really have like an insane
[01:30:48] set so you can use whatever
[01:30:52] okay we're gonna do world three now we
[01:30:55] might get like absolutely [ __ ] uh
[01:30:58] because the enemies are level 90 and our
[01:31:00] Kafka is good but our Luca is mid
[01:31:04] um and we're still in the process of
[01:31:06] gearing her so don't judge me
[01:31:11] don't judge me
[01:31:14] are you talking slow today I'm sleep
[01:31:15] deprived
[01:31:18] uh we're gonna run a Healer probably the
[01:31:21] ultra and then last slot will be Flex I
[01:31:24] think we're gonna do silver wolf and
[01:31:26] then implant
[01:31:27] I mean he's already weak to our whole
[01:31:29] team but I mean silver wolf is still
[01:31:30] silver wolf
[01:31:32] so
[01:31:34] yeah
[01:31:40] where is your sampo [ __ ] you shut up
[01:31:42] [ __ ] you
[01:31:53] I'm gonna give Lucha the healing like
[01:31:55] you're supposed to use the I don't like
[01:31:56] this icon because it gives you HP and he
[01:31:58] doesn't want HP but our build is [ __ ]
[01:32:00] because we have to give his pieces to
[01:32:02] someone else so we're just gonna use
[01:32:05] um
[01:32:07] yeah we're just gonna use that to make
[01:32:08] up for it like our body's [ __ ] plus
[01:32:09] zero I might have a four star body I can
[01:32:12] use
[01:32:13] yeah that's actually a lot smarter okay
[01:32:14] I'll just use a four-star buddy never
[01:32:15] mind
[01:32:28] okay we'll be fine with this one
[01:32:32] actually
[01:32:33] oh Jesus all right
[01:32:37] okay we should be good for now
[01:32:40] we're gonna get [ __ ] by the way we're
[01:32:41] like there's like a very high chance we
[01:32:43] get [ __ ]
[01:32:49] what should we do you guys are doing a
[01:32:51] Hillary it makes sense
[01:32:53] I'll get personality I guess there's no
[01:32:55] other option it's not even a question
[01:33:06] forgetting me finally diagnosed with
[01:33:08] ADHD okay shut up while watching your
[01:33:11] streams that you and I are literally the
[01:33:13] same person from how fast you always
[01:33:15] talk to your inability to complete star
[01:33:18] rail events okay tested and my results
[01:33:21] said I had a moderate to severe risk and
[01:33:23] now I am on meds I mean good for you
[01:33:26] that's good but why why is why are you
[01:33:30] like oh it's because of you it's not it
[01:33:33] Galactic big lotto because we like the
[01:33:35] gamble uh and we like to Kafka look at
[01:33:38] her
[01:33:40] okay respectfully and I genuinely mean
[01:33:42] this with the utmost amount of respect
[01:33:45] the most respect possible like I'm being
[01:33:48] very respectful
[01:33:49] they are the same amount of pixels as
[01:33:51] her head
[01:34:05] respectfully though
[01:34:10] where's the Applause
[01:34:14] I hate that he's single Target but in
[01:34:16] this game wait they just you just killed
[01:34:18] it so you'll Target on this game is not
[01:34:19] bad because usually it's like bosses and

[01:37:14] foreign
[01:37:16] I'm stupid I'm actually stupid I thought
[01:37:17] it was insect net because you know
[01:37:19] there's the one where it's like you go
[01:37:20] deeper in the net and then you can like

[01:37:59] but you know what
[01:38:00] it's okay what if we get the robe and
[01:38:03] then we never spend Cosmic fragments
[01:38:06] true if anything this is better content
[01:38:08] and if there's anything I am a Content
[01:38:10] Warlord
[01:38:12] are there any sample maids in the chat
[01:38:13] that know which nihility one's good let
[01:38:15] me read them when there's a battle
[01:38:16] return 40 energy when an enemy receives
[01:38:19] dot Panthers increases okay that's nice
[01:38:20] pattern residence increases base chance
[01:38:22] of applying status of 100 and the
[01:38:25] duration plus one and add one sack
[01:38:27] we probably have enough up time with
[01:38:29] this one nearly our Rogers on this
[01:38:31] chance I've been playing two sacks of
[01:38:32] confusion and two devoid what the [ __ ]
[01:38:33] is this oh this looks good
[01:38:36] okay left and right look like the best
[01:38:38] ones
[01:38:39] right
[01:38:41] three left
[01:38:43] I like this one probably
[01:38:47] but
[01:38:52] this looks like a funny number and I
[01:38:54] like funny numbers more than consistency
[01:38:56] so we're gonna go funny numbers
[01:39:00] yeah we'll do left and right dude do I
[01:39:02] flip again sixty percent to lose but
[01:39:03] forty percent to win sixty percent to
[01:39:05] lose is 40 to win a lot of people don't
[01:39:08] consider that
[01:39:11] a lot of people fail to consider that
[01:39:13] sixty percent to lose is 40 to win
[01:39:16] hey I win big break effect is nice uh no
[01:39:20] brake efficiency is nice I mean it's
[01:39:23] fine in a Hillary team we'll do a
[01:39:24] factory ah actually no let's just do
[01:39:26] this we don't need a factory we have a
[01:39:28] lot of hit rate
[01:39:30] what is this 90 okay we're not doing 90.
[01:39:33] uh but we want to so I'm happy
[01:39:40] let's wait
[01:39:52] what does that mean
[01:39:56] can I have fun this time time for a bug
[01:40:00] we're gonna implant either lightning or
[01:40:02] Quantum if we get Quantum we burst on
[01:40:04] Silver if it breaks up Shield if we got
[01:40:06] lightning we're happy
[01:40:07] that's good but we're still gonna burst
[01:40:15] um
[01:40:16] is there any shock on him
[01:40:18] yes there is so I don't need to skill
[01:40:20] first we're gonna Alt
[01:40:22] well he's not I could have applied bleed
[01:40:24] first
[01:40:31] let's see some Sparks wait does all the
[01:40:34] five bleed I forget
[01:40:35] no it doesn't we need to skill first
[01:40:37] okay that's fine we didn't [ __ ] up then

[01:41:10] number sure you're not ready you're
[01:41:11] action already your action already funny
[01:41:13] Kafka time
[01:41:16] that was as much as I thought but it's
[01:41:17] still funny wait till we have our own
[01:41:19] we have our old time to say funny Kafka
[01:41:21] time
[01:41:22] boom
[01:41:24] [Laughter]
[01:41:27] okay dude
[01:41:30] I [ __ ] is the Hillary
[01:41:36] wait this is so good shining trapezoid
[01:41:40] cause okay no Hillary blessing is really
[01:41:42] nice but this Kaku clock [ __ ] us and
[01:41:45] Galactic big Lotto is gonna Galactic big
[01:41:46] [ __ ] us so I kind of want to reroll the
[01:41:49] Hillary wax is nice but I'm not a reroll
[01:41:52] the rest
[01:41:52] so I think we reroll it
[01:41:55] doctors rub is really nice though
[01:41:58] boxers rope is very nice doctors is not
[01:42:01] I think we dude we have the dice this is
[01:42:04] so bad
[01:42:05] I think we have to I think we have to
[01:42:07] reroll I really like robe though but
[01:42:13] you can get robe with dice true
[01:42:19] okay these two are really good these
[01:42:21] three are actually insane
[01:42:23] wax of preservation
[01:42:25] I mean not so much but these are really
[01:42:28] good so
[01:42:30] that is good but we're not shielded so
[01:42:33] is what it is maybe if I had japard
[01:42:38] okay we want
[01:42:42] okay well we got nothing
[01:42:49] but yeah also we're not playing a crit
[01:42:51] team dude my brain is rotted with crit
[01:42:53] like I wake up I want crit rate I go to
[01:42:56] sleep I want crit damage literally all I
[01:42:58] can think about is crit
[01:43:00] my brain is rotting
[01:43:02] uh we'll do a curio cause Gamba
[01:43:05] this is good
[01:43:14] what's your Kafka build boom
[01:43:18] uh
[01:43:25] okay so the skillboard one is the best
[01:43:28] uh it looks like but I don't like it
[01:43:30] because it makes the team feel weird
[01:43:32] like I don't want to not I don't want to
[01:43:34] like play it now and then later I'm like
[01:43:36] damn I have no skill points when I'm
[01:43:38] playing the team normally so I kind of
[01:43:40] don't want to take it because it's going
[01:43:41] to skew my existence
[01:43:45] yeah this gives you energy we'll do
[01:43:46] energy
[01:43:52] no no no
[01:43:55] I was behind them

[01:56:05] [Music]
[01:56:07] um I kind of want to just not level any
[01:56:09] of them because
[01:56:12] damage percent is pretty good
[01:56:22] this one is really good though
[01:56:25] this is actually really good
[01:56:27] it's yeah this is okay this one's worth

[02:01:25] my God
[02:01:49] oh

[02:02:06] um
[02:02:07] um
[02:02:09] oh lee she's that boom and then they
[02:02:11] just died
[02:02:15] me next Kafka all right hopefully we get
[02:02:17] Space healing station on Lightning ball
[02:02:20] I'm lucky
[02:02:23] uh this could be good
[02:02:32] now you know nahili's broken okay but
[02:02:34] I'm still not leveling sampo Frick you
[02:02:36] Frick you sample means Frick you I will
[02:02:39] never admit I'm wrong never
[02:02:44] truly surely this week surely this week
[02:02:45] he's leveled surely surely like
[02:02:47] literally today
[02:03:02] forgot I have E1 by Lou
[02:03:10] dude what the [ __ ] is the Capo
[02:03:23] okay back third aware oh sudge
[02:03:36] okay that was really fun I kind of want
[02:03:37] to do it again
[02:03:38] um lady Universe was to level our relics
[02:03:42] because like we don't have Relic XP so
[02:03:43] surely now I have enough
[02:03:50] okay I don't even have enough to do this
[02:03:52] well XD
[02:03:54] um but what I can do is something very
[02:03:57] dumb
[02:03:58] now you might be like locks
[02:04:00] what do you mean with something very
[02:04:01] dumb you wouldn't do something dumb
[02:04:05] you're a smart man why were you
[02:04:06] something dumb
[02:04:12] you want to do something dumb would you
[02:04:15] no not the zox I know you're gonna do
[02:04:17] something though
[02:04:22] you wouldn't do something dumb sucks I
[02:04:24] know you better than that
[02:04:33] okay what if we custom synthesis okay
[02:04:36] listen what if we listen we can custom
[02:04:38] synthesize a piece I don't know which
[02:04:40] one I want to do yet but we still have a
[02:04:44] custom synthesis
[02:04:48] and it is waiting to be used
[02:04:57] and I kind of want a lightning Ball but
[02:04:59] the problem is it might suck balls
[02:05:10] get EHR but I don't need HR
[02:05:15] Kafka only wants HR if she's E4
[02:05:31] oh wait I meant to say err I said EHR
[02:05:33] you know what I meant I hope you know
[02:05:36] what I meant you only need a ER energy
[02:05:40] recharge if you're E4
[02:05:43] happy 16b
[02:05:45] Montana
[02:05:49] okay what if we do one non-customized
[02:05:52] just a normal one we see what we get if
[02:05:53] it's bad we custom it agree agree
[02:05:57] okay well it's that
[02:05:59] stop saying letters okay you need effect
[02:06:02] more affected rate at E1 or with your
[02:06:05] licone and then you need more you only
[02:06:07] want an err rope if you're E4
[02:06:11] not EHR ER
[02:06:15] stands for energy recharge recharge for
[02:06:18] those wondering They just added recharge
[02:06:20] twice it was like a typo they left it in
[02:06:22] so it's all good
[02:06:44] wait I almost did wind what the [ __ ] did
[02:06:46] I just do
[02:06:50] surely we do dude am I doing a lightning
[02:06:52] damage on surely surely surely right
[02:06:54] Shirley
[02:06:59] I don't need ER ropes I have I have
[02:07:01] plenty
[02:07:03] but I don't have a good lighting ball on
[02:07:05] any set
[02:07:06] and here's the thing if it gets so
[02:07:09] genuine wants inner tall soda right but
[02:07:11] if it gets a bunch of crit we can still
[02:07:13] give it to him and if it gets attack or
[02:07:16] speed we give it to Kafka
[02:07:19] so as long as the stats aren't flat then
[02:07:22] we're happy
[02:07:23] is my theorem
[02:07:30] Falls trap
[02:07:32] this is a customized synthesis what will
[02:07:35] ziox get
[02:07:37] oh wait why wait wait
[02:07:47] wait
[02:07:55] okay I almost wish this was [ __ ]
[02:07:57] inertia Soto now
[02:07:59] what the [ __ ]
[02:08:00] so if this goes attack percent we give
[02:08:03] it to Kafka if it goes crit we give it
[02:08:04] to Jun and we can actually play him
[02:08:06] again and if it goes defense we are
[02:08:09] ending stream and I'm breaking
[02:08:10] everything that I own
[02:08:11] but that's not gonna happen so we're
[02:08:13] gonna level this
[02:08:15] uh unfortunately I don't have any Relic
[02:08:17] XP at all but
[02:08:19] I'll just throw something away
[02:08:29] holy [ __ ] dude
[02:08:32] holy [ __ ]
[02:08:38] what should I throw I need I need to
[02:08:40] throw a relic because I have no XP maybe
[02:08:42] a four star I probably have a spare four
[02:08:43] star that I can throw
[02:09:09] all right
[02:09:11] moment of Destiny chat moment of [ __ ]
[02:09:14] destiny
[02:09:16] wait where is it
[02:09:19] then I'll lock it
[02:09:20] or to have it equipped
[02:09:30] okay we'll start with the plus six
[02:09:34] ready
[02:09:38] attack or crit is good attack for Kafka
[02:09:40] crit for literally anyone else okay well
[02:09:43] this is almost wasted for Kafka at this
[02:09:45] point
[02:09:46] um
[02:09:47] but I'm happy I mean We're Not Gonna
[02:09:50] complain with crit
[02:09:52] okay one more
[02:09:56] okay
[02:10:07] I'm never gonna use this again right
[02:10:08] it's not dumb to throw this right
[02:10:25] foreign
[02:10:36] it's actually still good it's still good
[02:10:39] I'll prove it it's still good it's still
[02:10:40] good it's one miss nobody cares about
[02:10:42] one miss it is still good it is
[02:10:45] literally still good luck look I'll show
[02:10:46] you guys I'll show you guys
[02:10:48] look let me uh we'll throw wait one sec
[02:10:51] asking I can throw but it's still good
[02:10:52] it's literally still good it's still
[02:10:54] good it's so good you're either coping
[02:10:55] or you admit that it's still good
[02:10:57] there's only two solutions in this world
[02:10:58] there's only two possibilities either
[02:11:01] you're coping or you admit that it's
[02:11:02] still good those are the only two
[02:11:03] outcomes
[02:11:12] yeah I'm throwing five stars I don't
[02:11:13] care
[02:11:14] I know I shouldn't
[02:11:16] but
[02:11:22] wait that's the best roll okay this is
[02:11:24] actually good actually good this is
[02:11:26] actually good we missed one roll but who
[02:11:29] cares actually really good for Kafka
[02:11:31] yeah you can also use it on anyone like
[02:11:34] even a non even like a normal crit carry
[02:11:36] would want attack so yeah good
[02:11:43] nice I mean Kafka wants to talk way more
[02:11:45] than crit so it's not like it's not like
[02:11:48] we got on like it's like it's bad to get
[02:11:50] attacked attack attacks better so
[02:11:52] uh I don't have gloves equipped there
[02:11:54] you go
[02:11:56] and then we want a fleet of ageless I
[02:11:58] mean yeah space ceiling station rope
[02:12:00] which should be oh it's on Luca
[02:12:03] Lucas Timothy
[02:12:06] you have another one
[02:12:08] surely I have another one right Shirley
[02:12:12] I do
[02:12:13] it's not as good though
[02:12:26] [ __ ] we need three more speed man
[02:12:47] okay the only thing we need to level now
[02:12:49] is this rope uh which is unfortunately
[02:12:51] plus zero because I am broke but we will
[02:12:54] level it soon
[02:12:55] [Laughter]
[02:13:00] foreign
[02:13:03] six it and just do this
[02:13:09] okay plus six for now we'll get it 15
[02:13:11] later
[02:13:14] okay
[02:13:16] level booth for Speed wait are my boots
[02:13:18] not 15 yeah my boots are 15.
[02:13:20] but we can get a little bit more speed
[02:13:22] like we can like this has no sub stats
[02:13:24] right so we can get a better body with
[02:13:26] like speed sub stats I probably have one
[02:13:28] honestly no I don't well
[02:13:31] I'll get one soon
[02:13:34] or like I might be able to get a speed
[02:13:36] sub stat maybe I'm like
[02:13:38] like a better
[02:13:41] um hat
[02:13:43] I love you Mr socks you are the best and
[02:13:46] tallest Street true true
[02:13:51] yeah it is
[02:13:54] I can only do another as your own
[02:13:56] because we need relics
[02:13:58] I I Really Wanna dude I
[02:14:00] mean we could also make this a farming
[02:14:02] stream but I kind of don't want to farm
[02:14:03] they all stream If I level this guy I
[02:14:05] also don't have a light cone for him
[02:14:07] I mean I guess we just use this it's
[02:14:08] fine
[02:14:13] I just have to level it
[02:14:22] you samples icon I don't have it I
[02:14:24] actually don't have one I don't even
[02:14:25] have one copy of it
[02:14:28] wait how many standard pulls do I have
[02:14:30] because the month reset
[02:14:32] but I'm 14 what the [ __ ]
[02:14:34] yeah dude handball it's free
[02:14:46] all right [ __ ] it surely a five star
[02:14:48] surely japard
[02:14:50] unlucky
[02:14:52] because something good we could still
[02:14:53] get uh Idol ones we could get a nice
[02:14:55] light cone
[02:15:03] okay okay
[02:15:07] okay
[02:15:11] oh Asda this is cool another iced uh oh
[02:15:15] we also got this
[02:15:19] a nice ass is good
[02:15:21] happy about that
[02:15:26] all right let's do another run
[02:15:31] remove it dude I wanted to [ __ ] dude I'm
[02:15:34] kind of tilted I wanted to do the early
[02:15:36] memory chaos floors off stream so I can
[02:15:39] do the lay ones on stream
[02:15:40] but I kind of didn't have time all good
[02:15:42] okay we'll do another world uh I don't
[02:15:45] want to do three anymore though we'll
[02:15:46] try a different one
[02:15:48] do we need seven at all
[02:16:03] can you have the domination emote the
[02:16:05] celebrated Kafka
[02:16:09] what the [ __ ] is domination
[02:16:11] why do you need more speed okay the more
[02:16:13] speed you have the faster your Auto
[02:16:15] Battle Is So if you have a if you have a
[02:16:18] lot of speed your double silver wolf
[02:16:19] will say this is triple speed and then
[02:16:21] you're you're yeah it's faster
[02:16:30] yeah I added domination
[02:16:38] foreign
[02:16:57] why is it why is there a capital D I'll
[02:17:00] make it lowercase here right actually
[02:17:06] okay I change it
[02:17:18] when do you stop taking legal
[02:17:20] commissions I'm in a bit of a not taking
[02:17:23] legal commission told handsome lawyer
[02:17:29] yeah we can do an early floor [ __ ] it
[02:17:30] I'm bored
[02:17:32] well then early I'm a seafloor and then
[02:17:34] we'll go back to assimilated like we
[02:17:35] need to farm better relics but I don't
[02:17:37] feel like doing that right now so we're
[02:17:38] gonna do we're doing really far too
[02:17:41] do you want to enter the
[02:17:42] do you want to enter the Forgotten Hall
[02:17:45] yes yes I do we can probably Auto Battle
[02:17:47] this early on
[02:17:48] um but we get to visit bronia which is
[02:17:50] always a fun time so we're gonna do
[02:17:55] second half is better we'll do Kafka
[02:17:58] Luca
[02:18:06] actually
[02:18:08] no different stuff
[02:18:24] and worry no cleanse first off because I
[02:18:26] don't really care we'll be fine

[02:18:32] this bronyo you brought you up they
[02:18:35] don't look happy to see us

[02:18:54] okay lads
[02:19:10] the punches decide okay I can still
[02:19:13] apply bleed to her though she's already
[02:19:14] bleed they're already bleed
[02:19:17] I'll do this good times boom
[02:19:25] my daughter anyways yeah that's what
[02:19:27] we're gonna do

[02:20:26] if you're from behind and you use your
[02:20:27] Technique to fist them it actually does
[02:20:29] twice as much damage so make sure you do
[02:20:31] that as you can see we're gonna start
[02:20:32] the battle it's gonna apply bleed uh
[02:20:34] boom yeah so it applied me to the wrong

[02:25:34] but uh yeah
[02:25:39] she's a gamer okay true
[02:25:44] like on majek she should be on her lycon
[02:25:47] yeah
[02:25:49] but
[02:25:52] good times no time to say bye boom
[02:26:00] our bile is also on the wrong icon

[02:26:19] we can get closer
[02:26:24] don't get complacent
[02:26:33] ity
[02:26:35] I feel like Brian is better than the
[02:26:37] majority of standard character Banner
[02:26:39] characters in gen combined yeah Brady is
[02:26:40] probably better than every standard
[02:26:42] Captain character
[02:26:44] except like combined except probably not
[02:26:47] you don't combine kaching in there
[02:26:48] and maybe big teeth
[02:26:53] Brady is insane
[02:27:09] this sword needs sharpening
[02:27:15] there you go oh you got it took some
[02:27:18] time but we got it
[02:27:20] foreign
[02:27:49] she is more like nilu
[02:27:52] the nilu of Hawkeye star rail
[02:28:06] um wait let me um
[02:28:09] yeah I'll buy this
[02:28:11] did our silver has 2000 HP
[02:28:15] um okay we need to level this [ __ ] I
[02:28:16] mean it's fine we'll be okay but our
[02:28:19] Bilu should not be on this low HP
[02:28:23] we're gonna get our signature icon back
[02:28:24] we'll
[02:28:48] probably want speed boots but we'll just
[02:28:50] go HP for now [ __ ] speed I guess
[02:28:53] actually I definitely want speed boots
[02:29:11] hold that song you're an old ass song
[02:29:21] yeah we have no [ __ ] speed I'll give
[02:29:23] her more later

[02:29:27] is still early doesn't matter
[02:29:30] all right we're gonna play Kafka Lucas
[02:29:33] silver wolf
[02:29:36] um

[02:30:56] have one yeah
[02:30:59] I just don't feel like buying a better
[02:31:00] one because I feel like what if I look
[02:31:02] worse in HD
[02:31:04] what if the stream quality goes down
[02:31:06] with higher quality
[02:31:14] whatever we don't need to fly more bleed
[02:31:18] copium

[02:37:15] actually true
[02:37:26] this
[02:37:28] Cafe is yolan dude you're just saying
[02:37:31] that because they have a [ __ ] wire
[02:37:32] and booba okay that is nothing to do
[02:37:35] with their gameplay Kafka is literally
[02:37:37] if you're playing some random ass cringe
[02:37:40] noility team now it's actually good
[02:37:44] kauka is literally nilu
[02:37:49] [Music]
[02:37:58] X what's happening tomorrow
[02:38:01] is auto play griefing why am I about to
[02:38:03] base the attack on blade what is I'm
[02:38:05] just gonna keep it auto it's fine I I
[02:38:06] should know something
[02:38:09] I don't know I don't know what's
[02:38:11] happening yo yo okay
[02:38:21] yo what is it doing
[02:38:24] what does it do I literally can't so
[02:38:26] it's forcing my blade to normal attack
[02:38:29] every time
[02:38:31] blade Knows No Mercy
[02:38:35] look what is he doing
[02:38:40] foreign
[02:38:49] okay let's uh not waste skill points
[02:38:52] here
[02:38:54] okay now we can Auto Battle
[02:39:04] I don't know what autobah was doing but
[02:39:07] we should be fine now
[02:39:11] it's confusing to have three characters
[02:39:13] in a four maybe
[02:39:14] dude
[02:39:16] Maybe
[02:39:18] I don't know if we'll be able to clear
[02:39:20] this anymore but
[02:39:22] hopefully
[02:39:24] it also Auto Battle likes to spam heal
[02:39:27] on healers for some reason
[02:39:40] savor it for me
[02:39:47] shut the [ __ ] up
[02:39:54] okay that was close
[02:39:58] [Music]

[02:40:14] where's your cop girl she's second half
[02:40:17] we are getting there
[02:40:23] this is taking forever though
[02:40:33] okay maybe I shouldn't have a bottle
[02:40:34] this shit's taking too long
[02:40:40] why we're so [ __ ] is my blade still
[02:40:42] active
[02:40:53] I will dispatch oh
[02:40:59] uh we should still have time
[02:41:01] they don't look happy to see using
[02:41:08] can you give me a motivational speech
[02:41:11] for good luck for eight down hang twos
[02:41:13] in 110 pull
[02:41:16] um no but you can observe our calf color
[02:41:19] ready
[02:41:24] looking
[02:41:29] yeah the only problem with condo like
[02:41:31] this is
[02:41:32] it makes me wish I had a AOE sub DPS
[02:41:36] like sample but it's fine did they all
[02:41:39] just hit silver wolf what the [ __ ] was
[02:41:40] that
[02:41:41] they literally all targeted [ __ ]
[02:41:43] civil
[02:41:46] no one even hit anyone else
[02:41:49] time for a bug

[02:48:07] I mean
[02:48:08] she's on hit rate right now
[02:48:11] still need more but
[02:48:13] wait no nevermind actually
[02:48:15] yeah no we have a lot of no we have too
[02:48:17] much here right
[02:48:19] um
[02:48:20] yeah it doesn't matter as long as she
[02:48:22] doesn't die we're fine but she's she's
[02:48:23] kind of likely to die
[02:48:25] I think we're fine we're chilling as
[02:48:28] long as blade carries the other half
[02:48:29] we're fine
[02:48:30] I just kind of want to try doing
[02:48:33] Kafka Luca and then another nahility
[02:48:37] like uh I mean we could use Pila but I
[02:48:39] kind of want to try sample but we'll all
[02:48:40] of them probably later I can also play
[02:48:41] Asta
[02:48:48] make Luca one speed faster than Kafka
[02:48:50] yeah that's not a bad idea to get the
[02:48:51] bleed off first I could do that but our
[02:48:54] our kafka's on um
[02:48:57] yeah we could actually do that
[02:48:59] we would need speed boots then which I
[02:49:02] might have I think I have actually I do
[02:49:07] yeah but then we have like two like we
[02:49:09] look our speed is [ __ ] we want 134
[02:49:10] here
[02:49:11] but it'll still be fun it's actually not
[02:49:14] a bad idea
[02:49:16] and then we could probably play that
[02:49:18] second half
[02:49:21] or first actually these are weak to
[02:49:23] lightning
[02:49:26] there's no way to physical
[02:49:46] I can also just play Sealy I don't need
[02:49:48] to play blade every time
[02:50:02] only problem is in this instance I don't
[02:50:05] know the [ __ ] I'm playing
[02:50:07] um
[02:50:09] kind of on a silver wolf but if we
[02:50:11] silver wolf then we're gambling that we
[02:50:13] get physical but we don't even need it
[02:50:15] honestly
[02:50:19] pilo yeah but our pilot build is um
[02:50:25] I don't have enough dude I don't have
[02:50:28] that many noility like cones like we're
[02:50:31] ready dude there's so many Hillary
[02:50:33] characters that are good
[02:50:36] like if you play Kafka you need like 15
[02:50:38] ability like ones it's so hard
[02:50:50] got a second for MATA dude
[02:50:54] I have no XP
[02:50:59] it sounds so scuffed when you scream
[02:51:01] yeah I have to change this audio setup
[02:51:03] don't worry give me give me next stream
[02:51:04] it'll be fixed
[02:51:13] all right I think we send it
[02:51:16] um we'll just play
[02:51:20] oh we can play pillow
[02:51:32] let me just
[02:51:34] I mean we kind of can player but we
[02:51:35] could do like
[02:51:38] wait what if I just
[02:51:40] a good shot what if I just take a light
[02:51:42] code and I don't use the effect
[02:51:46] just for start so I don't die
[02:52:02] oh
[02:52:12] okay maybe not
[02:52:19] okay we'll just do um honestly [ __ ] it
[02:52:22] we could just brute force it
[02:52:28] we'll just brute force it with the same
[02:52:29] [ __ ]
[02:52:34] I can't cleanse the bleed stocks we're
[02:52:36] gonna get but surely we just out heal it
[02:52:45] who can I play here uh Is wealth geared
[02:52:49] no he doesn't have a icon
[02:52:53] [ __ ] it silly
[02:53:00] surely we'll
[02:53:08] give up
[02:53:12] all right there's these guys
[02:53:14] Ah that's gonna be annoying
[02:53:34] small fry
[02:53:37] we're not Alton always the cycle time to
[02:53:40] say bye
[02:53:43] boom wait he didn't die
[02:53:47] okay I wasted a cycle I did no damage
[02:53:58] we need to make sure he's bleeding this
[02:53:59] time
[02:54:00] oh these are Luca goes first which is
[02:54:02] good
[02:54:11] he's bleeding uh uh we shouldn't implant
[02:54:13] here because we don't have [ __ ] skill
[02:54:15] points
[02:54:25] it's fine
[02:54:34] stand still
[02:54:45] okay
[02:54:49] a good time time to say bye boom
[02:54:55] that was a lot more
[02:55:03] uh is he bleeding no he's not reset it
[02:55:07] oh he's bleeding
[02:55:10] whoa

[02:55:15] okay it's fine it's okay she's trying
[02:55:18] her best it's all good
[02:55:20] that's all I can ever ask okay all you
[02:55:22] can ask is that she drives her best
[02:55:27] we are so dead
[02:55:31] actually now we're fine actually we have
[02:55:33] the interrogation active in vitrogation
[02:55:36] all right we're gonna [ __ ] punch one
[02:55:39] of these dudes
[02:55:40] yep punch
[02:55:44] wait what order do I want to do this in
[02:55:46] probably one apply bleed but then if I
[02:55:47] do that then my silver wolf can't e and
[02:55:49] then my Kafka
[02:55:50] we have no skill points uh uh do I care
[02:55:53] about bleed yes
[02:56:01] okay we're gonna punch
[02:56:04] more enemies this combat needs up this
[02:56:08] is double speed
[02:56:14] I'm never using Luca's Alt
[02:56:16] ever
[02:56:18] Good Times
[02:56:30] where's the Applause never
[02:56:34] I just didn't feel like pressing two

[02:57:09] stand still give up
[02:57:15] okay
[02:57:29] Good Times
[02:57:39] should be free unless we randomly die
[02:57:42] somehow but I don't think that's gonna
[02:57:43] happen so it should be free
[02:57:45] say bye to Brandon
[02:57:49] oh my God
[02:57:50] okay I got shredded
[02:57:55] stand still

[02:58:24] I'm out of battling this surely it'll be
[02:58:28] fine

[02:58:35] attackers on [ __ ] but
[02:58:39] okay well

[02:58:48] way you're asking for a rerun in patch

[02:58:57] it's it's literally it's literally 1.2
[02:59:08] hello Julie
[02:59:14] [Applause]
[02:59:18] E6 Kafka or MC will kill her in the
[02:59:21] story do you think I care of Calcutta
[02:59:24] look I love Kafka she's great but if she
[02:59:27] dies in the story then she dies in the
[02:59:28] story
[02:59:31] dude if she lives she's probably gonna
[02:59:33] kill himiko I don't want himo go to die
[02:59:35] again
[02:59:37] wait why is my silly yo chill
[02:59:48] next
[02:59:58] time I have to turn all the battle off
[03:00:00] here kill this guy

[03:00:04] was good too
[03:00:11] and die
[03:00:18] did Blade's Talent us in a sec
[03:00:24] Kafka is not evil true
[03:00:28] true
[03:00:38] okay
[03:00:47] well
[03:00:50] crush them
[03:00:54] surely we don't die here
[03:01:02] it doesn't even matter if she's evil we
[03:01:04] can still hover on the astral Express
[03:01:05] not every character needs to be nice for
[03:01:07] them to join us
[03:01:08] we could be morally Gray
[03:01:11] no skill blade really oh
[03:01:14] tragedy I guess
[03:01:21] should I scale this guy he's probably
[03:01:22] gonna die but if he doesn't then I blade
[03:01:24] can't skill so I'm not gonna risk it
[03:01:31] okay I should rest it
[03:01:33] thanks
[03:01:40] dude holy [ __ ] that's a 99k
[03:01:45] now we're just chilling
[03:01:49] you'll pay for this
[03:01:58] Paradise savor it for me
[03:02:15] unnecessary
[03:02:20] look at that
[03:02:23] disappear all right goodbye bronyo rib
[03:02:25] bozo
[03:02:32] that was pretty easy
[03:02:37] oh that was seven okay eight the [ __ ] is
[03:02:39] eight monkey monkey might kill us far
[03:02:42] Bailey's not actually geared we might
[03:02:43] have to give her I know speed is nice
[03:02:45] but I don't think for more HP
[03:02:47] uh
[03:02:48] um
[03:02:50] we could just probably silly Brute Force
[03:02:53] this okay a low-key I don't think we
[03:02:55] should play Kafka here but I'm gonna
[03:02:57] play her because she's new
[03:02:58] because this is Sealy weakness Sealy
[03:03:00] weakness and then here it's blade
[03:03:01] weakness blade weakness so there's no
[03:03:03] real reason to go Kafka but I like Kafka
[03:03:06] so we're gonna play Kafka uh we'll do
[03:03:08] Kafka
[03:03:10] Luca
[03:03:19] and Balu
[03:03:25] yeah I mean we get a silver wolf implant
[03:03:27] we could guarantee that Electro yeah
[03:03:29] yeah this is actually not bad we could
[03:03:30] just guarantee it
[03:03:33] okay
[03:03:34] uh we'll play I don't want to play Silly
[03:03:37] we'll play something meow
[03:03:40] yeah so love is really quiet for that
[03:03:43] Joe Kafka build I cannot right now
[03:03:47] let's wait she's not on anything special
[03:03:52] I move my mouse so fast it [ __ ] like
[03:03:54] my game
[03:03:56] all right actually in the later floors
[03:03:59] now so we're gonna
[03:04:00] smack this dog that was kind of toxic
[03:04:03] I'm sorry PETA
[03:04:05] wolf what even are those are they dogs I
[03:04:07] don't know
[03:04:09] okay

[03:04:16] strength lend me your strength
[03:04:25] that heard a favorite for me
[03:04:28] your silly people have negative skill
[03:04:31] points this isn't a silly team this is a
[03:04:33] blade team the last law could be no
[03:04:35] character or any character it does not
[03:04:36] matter the lot like I don't even have to
[03:04:38] use silly and we're still gonna clear
[03:04:40] silly does not matter here this is the
[03:04:42] blade team we've entered this
[03:04:46] crush them I'll see you off
[03:04:53] however we do have a lot of skill points
[03:04:55] right now so we're chilling
[03:04:58] I will dispatch you
[03:05:10] know what that kills you right but we're
[03:05:12] just gonna scale I don't I don't want to
[03:05:13] skip
[03:05:15] wait that didn't even kill
[03:05:22] how did that not kill
[03:05:27] um okay
[03:05:29] I don't want to waste my ALT on the
[03:05:31] [ __ ] Hound
[03:05:34] now surely blades passive Blade's Talent
[03:05:36] will kill everything so it's fine
[03:05:39] my ceiling's not even bad it's just
[03:05:41] unlucky and she's not buffed by Ronnie

[03:06:39] able to kill this so silly actually
[03:06:41] could get in this
[03:06:43] turtle
[03:06:47] okay see the action is good all right
[03:06:50] Battlestar three out of three
[03:06:53] uh uh we have not lost seal points
[03:06:57] but I should be able to
[03:06:59] oh wait no I don't want to get monitored
[03:07:04] I don't think it matters Lucha's next
[03:07:07] skill no wait here Raider has a skill
[03:07:10] active right the icon
[03:07:15] I think we can do this
[03:07:24] I will dispatch you then we do this and
[03:07:27] then we brought you
[03:07:32] lend me your strength
[03:07:49] that awakens feelings in me every time

[03:08:21] all good all good all good that wasn't
[03:08:23] our fault
[03:08:26] that is not my fault the monkey that is
[03:08:30] not my fault I did nothing wrong monkey
[03:08:32] just out he just out monkeyed me it
[03:08:34] happened sometimes I get out monkeyed
[03:08:36] it's all good it happens it happens that
[03:08:39] wasn't it happens sometimes in life you
[03:08:41] win other times you spin and borpa spin
[03:08:44] we're gonna play
[03:08:46] um
[03:08:47] I don't need the last slot literally
[03:08:49] there's like no one that I want in this
[03:08:51] last slot
[03:08:52] um
[03:08:53] we're gonna do
[03:08:55] oh we'll just put silly again it's fine
[03:08:58] that wasn't our fault it kind of was but
[03:09:01] we can it's fine let's wait
[03:09:13] okay to be fair are the roaches on
[03:09:17] relatively low everything okay he's a
[03:09:20] level 70 weapon it's not even air like
[03:09:22] cone it's not even 80. he's not like
[03:09:24] fully maxed okay we're on an imaginary
[03:09:27] Sphere for no reason okay like he he he
[03:09:31] could be on a better build right now
[03:09:49] who's next
[03:09:54] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[03:09:56] illusions of the past
[03:10:00] you either heal your bronya no my bronya
[03:10:03] can stand her own ground
[03:10:06] but yeah she she just got on so
[03:10:09] all good
[03:10:10] this time this time we will know
[03:10:13] uh how many skills I need to use
[03:10:26] okay
[03:10:29] I'll see you off
[03:10:37] okay it's fine I won't get one shot yep
[03:10:41] then we do this
[03:10:45] all right we win
[03:10:47] we're gonna start by using our Altier
[03:10:53] because actually might go forward though
[03:10:55] but he shouldn't be able to one shot uh
[03:10:58] brania from 4K so that should be fine
[03:11:01] unless he randomly does 4K damage okay
[03:11:03] yeah I don't want to kill him here
[03:11:05] because we want to heal but then I lose
[03:11:06] a turn
[03:11:08] no wait we don't because we'll alt okay
[03:11:10] we don't kill him then we heal
[03:11:13] brania
[03:11:17] okay surely we're fine there's a chance
[03:11:20] of Sealy dies if our Sealy dies oh we're
[03:11:23] fine okay yeah that was good actually a
[03:11:25] good play
[03:11:41] Divinity unnecessary
[03:11:45] we can take a bit of damage on them
[03:11:48] uh we're gonna have to tank on branya
[03:11:50] here but that's fine we're gonna Focus
[03:11:54] I hate the [ __ ] monkey we'll hit the
[03:11:56] monkey
[03:12:00] why is Chad blinking
[03:12:06] oh blade hacking's even better actually
[03:12:09] because blade has so much HP there's no
[03:12:11] way monkey can kill him like ever
[03:12:12] literally no way
[03:12:22] we're communicating blink okay well yeah
[03:12:25] they're speaking the language of the
[03:12:27] Gods I guess
[03:12:29] thanks yeah as long as he focuses blade
[03:12:32] like we just don't die
[03:12:34] nope
[03:12:39] oh we lost a brand new turn there
[03:12:41] I really want to use silly skill but
[03:12:43] then he's going to Target Sealy which I
[03:12:44] don't really want
[03:12:56] no we'll be fine he doesn't do 3.6k
[03:13:04] calculated we do this and then we do
[03:13:09] um
[03:13:10] I will break it
[03:13:12] probably should focus the other dude
[03:13:13] maybe we're gonna save the cycle I kind
[03:13:16] of forgot about alt never mind blade
[03:13:18] just I well there you go all right that
[03:13:20] was easy uh this team might die because
[03:13:22] our Bailey socks but I think we'll be
[03:13:24] fine
[03:13:27] uh I kind of want to apply we'll start
[03:13:29] by applying bleed
[03:13:31] oh wait it only applies to one enemy
[03:13:33] okay that was dumb it's only gonna apply
[03:13:34] to run yeah those don't run oh we broke
[03:13:36] all those Shields though and now it
[03:13:37] applied bleed it no it applied to
[03:13:39] everyone okay that was good never mind I
[03:13:40] lied uh look at this
[03:13:43] then this
[03:13:53] is called here
[03:13:56] a lot of new viewers today welcome no
[03:13:58] not welcome run save yourself before
[03:14:00] it's too late
[03:14:02] listen to chat
[03:14:05] don't make the same mistake they did oh
[03:14:07] boom
[03:14:11] all right Lucas time we uh
[03:14:14] okay fly some bleed reduce some
[03:14:16] resistances you know all that stuff or
[03:14:17] defense threat
[03:14:19] boom vulnerability that we impair
[03:14:26] ment okay this could be a big hit
[03:14:29] well we don't have our alts but it's
[03:14:31] fine
[03:14:34] okay we're waiting for all it's all good
[03:14:36] that's fine just don't kill Luca yeah
[03:14:38] this team okay I didn't say this this
[03:14:41] team is definitely gonna die by the way
[03:14:42] okay just keep that in mind but it's
[03:14:45] fine
[03:14:46] because as long as I warned you guys
[03:14:48] that it's not a skill issue
[03:14:54] we are definitely dying unless by the
[03:14:56] assaultier
[03:14:58] if this guy hits Miley and barely gets
[03:14:59] old okay we win
[03:15:03] we actually win now we actually went now
[03:15:06] I just need to try to save a skill point
[03:15:07] for bailu because we oh my God
[03:15:12] stand still
[03:15:25] uh
[03:15:29] better throw a punch
[03:15:35] okay I got owned I'm gonna heal Luca I
[03:15:39] don't want to take any chances here
[03:15:44] we lose oh we probably like we lose a
[03:15:47] turn here but I think it's fine we have
[03:15:49] enough damage we just want to die
[03:15:51] okay
[03:15:52] now the [ __ ] part where we're gonna
[03:15:53] die
[03:16:02] um
[03:16:10] so far so good
[03:16:14] thank you
[03:16:16] she's about to punish us but hey all
[03:16:20] good I guess
[03:16:21] it's fine good times
[03:16:31] stand still
[03:16:38] why is my silver wolf on
[03:16:41] 918 age points
[03:16:51] okay so I have a theory curtains friend
[03:16:59] okay you guys are about to witness how
[03:17:01] big my brain is so normally I would
[03:17:03] normal attack here right but if I skill
[03:17:05] he bleeds but then you're like okay but
[03:17:06] you're gonna get punished and then if
[03:17:07] you get punished because you skill then
[03:17:09] you're gonna take so much damage in my
[03:17:10] die but if we skill we get our alt if we
[03:17:13] get our alt we can break this guy's
[03:17:14] Shield which means he doesn't attack our
[03:17:16] silver wolf who might die if he attacks
[03:17:18] the wolf so we have to
[03:17:20] even get her oh we did
[03:17:31] wait we still okay we still don't get to
[03:17:33] going by the way if my brother had more
[03:17:34] speed it would have been smart Okay uh
[03:17:37] now this looks dumb because I need to
[03:17:39] save a skill point so after normal
[03:17:40] attack on Kafka which is very stupid
[03:17:42] but
[03:17:44] well it was a nice drive I'm gonna say
[03:17:46] let's go Point [ __ ] it
[03:17:52] okay winnable actually winnable
[03:17:56] we don't want to heal it's probably him
[03:17:59] that didn't even touch silver okay well
[03:18:01] all good
[03:18:07] could have just altered no I couldn't
[03:18:09] have I would have had my alts about it I
[03:18:10] have to skill
[03:18:27] yo

[03:21:35] this is happening no matter what second
[03:21:37] half looks pretty good for cap Kafka
[03:21:39] sample would be insane uh but we're
[03:21:41] gonna play Kafka Luca
[03:21:43] and uh probably the same team we always
[03:21:45] do the only thing is I kind of want my
[03:21:47] Balu to not suck so we're gonna go to
[03:21:49] bailu and we're going to
[03:21:53] okay why do I have no abundance traces
[03:21:55] does anyone know why are my healers like

[03:22:58] okay should be good enough for now
[03:23:00] um oh tiny new viewers by the way in
[03:23:03] case they're wondering so my uh get your
[03:23:05] artifact lock is bad right but my um if
[03:23:08] you're wondering about my star rail lock
[03:23:09] we just got this here on the new set
[03:23:12] when it came out so uh 29 crew damage on
[03:23:15] a set that wants uh crit damage so uh
[03:23:17] for Brandy who only wants great damage
[03:23:18] so
[03:23:20] oh also you can look at my blade as the
[03:23:22] number one blade made okay uh so we have
[03:23:24] a four piece laundry this piece this uh
[03:23:26] artifact Relic has no wasted stats crit
[03:23:29] HP uh and speed uh this one has uh
[03:23:32] insane crit value in case you were
[03:23:33] wondering uh our body has okay this one
[03:23:36] kind of sucks I'm not gonna lie but you
[03:23:38] know crit rate HP it is what it is it
[03:23:39] sucks it is what it is uh uh boots 22
[03:23:42] for damage okay
[03:23:44] ball okay speed HP double crit okay
[03:23:48] rope
[03:23:49] Rope Rope could be better
[03:23:53] so our ratio is pretty good also we get
[03:23:56] crit rate from something I forget
[03:23:58] yeah from stat set
[03:24:03] okay
[03:24:04] um so no one asked I know no one not

[03:35:54] die
[03:35:58] okay
[03:35:59] I have an idea I'm gonna have normal
[03:36:01] attack and if he doesn't die from the
[03:36:02] null attack I heal on bailu and then I
[03:36:04] alterable

[03:36:18] foreign
[03:36:24] I can't I can't lie so I don't know who
[03:36:28] I should focus I know this guy Stacks
[03:36:30] bleed on you but as far rock is a
[03:36:32] [ __ ] [ __ ] so he should probably kill
[03:36:33] song
[03:36:35] um
[03:36:40] I mean following the chat I love strong
[03:36:42] but fighting him is annoying is what I
[03:36:44] mean
[03:36:46] I've got a way to get to let's finish
[03:36:48] this you can cleanse bleed yeah yeah
[03:36:53] okay surely we just kill him we just
[03:36:54] kill this guy I listen listen I
[03:37:09] yeah let me think I think we tanked the
[03:37:11] bleed and we kill sparrog but I'm afraid
[03:37:13] like I yeah I think we take the bleed I
[03:37:16] think we have to I don't think we have a
[03:37:17] choice I want to use my ALT first but if
[03:37:19] we implant Quantum then I don't want to
[03:37:20] so we're gonna implant
[03:37:22] first quantum
[03:37:27] [Music]
[03:37:33] Good Times time to say bye
[03:37:36] yeah calco will kill both at the same
[03:37:38] time so true
[03:37:41] bye Lou you better you better
[03:37:45] sorry
[03:37:46] I'm sorry I I don't know what got a hold
[03:37:48] of me please heal
[03:37:51] okay that was [ __ ] terrible it didn't
[03:37:53] even bounce on her but it's fine
[03:37:56] um
[03:37:58] uh
[03:38:00] uh bleed suck
[03:38:02] okay Luca's dead Luca is
[03:38:07] which is the one thing she has going for
[03:38:09] her
[03:38:10] um so we can at least survive him once
[03:38:12] he does die
[03:38:14] oh no no no no no don't take my little
[03:38:16] orca no it's fine this is fine just
[03:38:18] don't think about it that's
[03:38:22] fine
[03:38:23] as long as he doesn't take by the way
[03:38:25] we're fine this is actually fine like
[03:38:26] literally fine you think I'm coping you
[03:38:28] think I'm coping it's literally fine
[03:38:35] it was literally fine yo
[03:38:38] defense raid
[03:38:40] how you been
[03:38:45] I dude one sec I need to think
[03:38:48] I don't need to skill on Luca right so
[03:38:50] there's no reason to save a skill point
[03:38:52] but if I say the skill point I can just
[03:38:53] Alt
[03:38:59] okay because if I I guess shut up sorry
[03:39:03] sorry sorry I could I wanna all to heal
[03:39:06] everyone but I also want a skill if my
[03:39:08] skill bounces profusely I don't need to
[03:39:10] alt but if my skill doesn't bounce well
[03:39:12] then I need to alt and skill which is a
[03:39:13] waste so it depends on my bounces if my
[03:39:16] best case scenario it bounces here then
[03:39:19] bailu then Luca and then
[03:39:23] actually no basket scenario skips by Lou
[03:39:25] it does silver wolf then Luca then Kafka
[03:39:27] and then I don't need to Alt
[03:39:30] yeah hopefully
[03:39:32] not bad honestly not bad oh wait
[03:39:35] nevermind

[03:39:45] afraid I'm just gonna
[03:39:47] more enemies
[03:39:49] more enemies we need to kill this hand
[03:39:52] before he wakes up
[03:39:54] give up
[03:39:55] wake up no no the makeup I don't think I
[03:39:59] can apply bleed here we don't have
[03:40:00] enough skill points
[03:40:03] sag
[03:40:08] Good Times time to say bye
[03:40:17] why am I not focusing the hand am I dumb
[03:40:19] why haven't I been focusing it I don't
[03:40:21] actually know
[03:40:24] um
[03:40:26] kafka's AOE would kill it I'm gonna be
[03:40:28] honest it might die to windshear oh not
[03:40:30] windshear sorry uh uh shock and the
[03:40:33] shield break but
[03:40:40] yeah honestly it's fine as long as it
[03:40:41] doesn't capture like if it we're
[03:40:43] actually fine I think
[03:40:44] I think we're fine
[03:40:46] because I get this heel off and then as
[03:40:48] long as we don't just like this has to
[03:40:49] bounce the syllables if this bounces to
[03:40:51] Silver Wolf why is it in slow motion
[03:40:56] please don't think it's a wolf can I
[03:40:58] have fun this time oh wait okay it's not
[03:41:00] even his turn we're fine Rock's fine
[03:41:06] I think we can kill it I think we're
[03:41:07] fine
[03:41:10] I really want to apply bleed to this guy
[03:41:12] man but then our calf cast a basic
[03:41:14] attack which is really bad
[03:41:22] don't hit so little
[03:41:25] don't hit the level
[03:41:35] let me cook
[03:41:39] please buy Loop by Lou I don't ask much
[03:41:41] of you in fact I asked nothing of you
[03:41:44] other than to bounce your healing vile
[03:41:46] onto the wolf
[03:41:49] okay good actually good actually good
[03:41:51] thank God
[03:41:53] when he attacks twice
[03:42:03] stand still where's the Applause
[03:42:15] Good Times never last time to say bye
[03:42:22] it's like [ __ ] okay we win we actually
[03:42:25] win uh I'm Gonna Save skill points
[03:42:27] but as long as okay there's a chance he
[03:42:30] wakes up in one shot silver wolf unless
[03:42:32] he one shot silver so we have
[03:42:33] interrogation on her we should be fine
[03:42:35] we have three sacks of interrogation we
[03:42:36] should be fine
[03:42:40] yeah we're fine
[03:42:48] more enemies wait why is my soulmate
[03:42:51] actually dying
[03:42:53] yo please bounce on her dude okay our
[03:42:56] dog say bye to breathing well yeah
[03:43:00] it's fine we have a really tense we Auto
[03:43:02] Battle wasted two to three of our cycles
[03:43:04] and we have 10 to spare that's how much
[03:43:07] damage we're dealing we have so much
[03:43:09] more damage
[03:43:10] it's just we need to not die
[03:43:16] can I have fun this time good times
[03:43:24] I'm gonna say I'm gonna save this coupon
[03:43:26] just to heal like there's no point in
[03:43:27] risking this
[03:43:29] uh I'm gonna steal catfish is bleeding
[03:43:32] okay that's good I'm too good to me
[03:43:35] why did Kafka say it like that
[03:43:38] easy foreign
[03:43:40] like 11 Cycles to spare and
[03:43:42] automatically wasted like three do you
[03:43:44] ever like oh no we have the four star
[03:43:46] Lego not even fully superimposed our
[03:43:48] Kafka has uh what is it called good
[03:43:50] night sleep well S3
[03:43:54] all right easy
[03:44:02] Kafka wait a second Kafka against Kafka
[03:44:04] flush I mean we're gonna play blade
[03:44:07] not gonna lie blade kind of [ __ ] up
[03:44:09] Kafka
[03:44:12] the first half
[03:44:19] this is a different memory chaos than
[03:44:20] the last time we did it because we
[03:44:21] didn't fight the deer at all like we
[03:44:23] fully cleared it we're at 410 and we did
[03:44:25] fight the deer at all today and usually
[03:44:27] there's a deer so I guess we didn't do
[03:44:29] last one or it just changed
[03:44:32] um
[03:44:38] okay if I'm smart I do silver wolf Sealy
[03:44:41] and then we just win but I like Kafka
[03:44:43] and I think Kafka is cool so we're gonna
[03:44:45] play Kafka
[03:44:46] um we will do this and then by Lou again
[03:44:49] we kind of want to cleanse so Natasha's
[03:44:51] better but you know we're just gonna
[03:44:53] play bailu and then we'll cry if we uh
[03:44:55] need a cleanse
[03:44:57] second half last character does not
[03:44:59] matter
[03:45:00] but we'll do pillow
[03:45:04] oh no pillow's actually good because we
[03:45:06] can remove Buffs from enemies but luitch
[03:45:08] also does that
[03:45:09] but yeah
[03:45:12] level your Balu Trace
[03:45:14] what do you mean dude you're telling me
[03:45:16] your Bible has more traces than 666
[03:45:23] this is actually so good okay maybe we
[03:45:25] should get that dude how the [ __ ] do I
[03:45:28] even dude I'm not getting these though
[03:45:30] no way you're asking me to farm
[03:45:32] abundancy
[03:45:42] I did yep
[03:45:45] I can't even Ascend her bro
[03:45:49] I can ironically I said Natasha by
[03:45:51] accident because I pre-farmed I farmed
[03:45:54] too many mats for Luca by uh yeah for
[03:45:56] Luca by accident so I have enough spare
[03:45:59] to fully Ascend or Natasha I'm not even
[03:46:01] kidding so yeah
[03:46:07] do you guys want to see how much I
[03:46:09] accidentally pretty hard for Kafka I
[03:46:11] have I have 35.
[03:46:14] and nobody other than Kafka and Jing
[03:46:16] Yuen uses them
[03:46:19] why is my name meow
[03:46:22] oh yeah wait no no sushi is physical I
[03:46:24] mean for the physical ones sure but I
[03:46:25] don't really want a place to train
[03:46:31] terrible I thought sir will use the
[03:46:32] other lightning ones does she not
[03:46:41] yeah see
[03:46:50] all right stay tuned
[03:46:52] memory of chaos is I mean forgot would
[03:46:55] you like to enter the Forgotten Hall
[03:46:57] what is that what is it called simulator
[03:46:58] is so much more fun but it's like you
[03:47:01] don't really want to like test a
[03:47:02] character there because it kind of skews
[03:47:03] everything so
[03:47:08] um okay I think we just play these teams
[03:47:12] Natasha would unironically be better
[03:47:14] here but
[03:47:15] is what it is
[03:47:24] actually I might be able to level
[03:47:28] no I can't
[03:47:37] they don't look happy to see
[03:47:41] does that hurt
[03:47:46] anyways uh
[03:47:48] we'll see if this team does if this team
[03:47:49] dies we'll go level by Lou and then
[03:47:51] we'll clear memory kills 10. if this
[03:47:53] team doesn't die then we'll clear it I
[03:47:54] will be happy okay okay sorry that was
[03:47:57] cringe
[03:48:09] as long as how do I build Kafka I have a
[03:48:14] after stream I will upload the Kafka
[03:48:15] guide I'm still in the process of
[03:48:17] editing it it'll probably be out
[03:48:18] tomorrow because there's a lot I wanted
[03:48:19] to test and then it'll come out for now
[03:48:22] what you need to know is the following
[03:48:23] your sets don't really matter go attack
[03:48:25] and speed if you want to go optimal sets
[03:48:27] you go the lighting set or two piece two
[03:48:30] piece or there's like a few other four
[03:48:32] pieces that kind of work
[03:48:34] and for your Stellar the the the planner
[03:48:38] ornaments
[03:48:40] space uh stealing station the one that
[03:48:43] gives you 24 attack is the best by a
[03:48:45] decent amount
[03:48:46] Fleet of the Ageless is fine too if you
[03:48:49] need a lot of hit rate which is E1 or uh
[03:48:52] with your lycone or both then you can go
[03:48:55] for hit rate as well uh on the galactic
[03:48:58] thing whatever it's called Pan Galactic
[03:49:00] Enterprise or whatever
[03:49:02] um but space stealing station is still
[03:49:04] the best you don't really want crit on
[03:49:06] her because you're mostly damage or a
[03:49:08] significant amount of damage comes from
[03:49:09] dots
[03:49:10] uh someone shot that factory is
[03:49:12] important a little bit not a lot so if
[03:49:14] you have E1 or her lycon or both you to
[03:49:17] get 100 chance of applying everything
[03:49:18] you need a lot of hit rate you need 68
[03:49:21] or 67 67. which is a decent amount uh
[03:49:24] but even if you're not all the way up
[03:49:25] there it's still fine but at e0 for a
[03:49:29] normal like normal Kafka with no E1 no
[03:49:31] icon well a like one that's not her
[03:49:34] signature you only need 28
[03:49:37] yeah 28 hit rate
[03:49:39] but you get 18 for free from your minor
[03:49:42] traces so that means 10 in your sub
[03:49:44] stats which is like three rolls or
[03:49:46] something which is really not a lot so
[03:49:48] for most kafka's that aren't E1 you
[03:49:51] really only need like a little bit of
[03:49:52] hit rate
[03:49:53] then for your rope you want to attack
[03:49:55] and for your ball you want lightning but
[03:49:57] I'll talk about this more in the guide
[03:49:58] the only time you want err on your rope
[03:50:00] is that E4
[03:50:01] that's all okay uh let's fist them
[03:50:10] the only thing I'm not sure about with
[03:50:11] Kafka is like the break effect teams
[03:50:13] because from my understanding if you
[03:50:16] want to do
[03:50:17] why is someone track called kafka's good
[03:50:19] boy you're you guys all right anyways
[03:50:22] usually I I feel like if you want to do
[03:50:24] break effect things you put break effect
[03:50:26] on another designated breaker like
[03:50:27] example serval so that your Kafka
[03:50:29] doesn't have to do like some weird ass
[03:50:30] hybrid build
[03:50:33] um
[03:50:33] but outside of that
[03:50:36] there's a question mark
[03:50:39] stand still
[03:50:42] oh [ __ ] I should alter before you hit us
[03:50:43] good time
[03:50:48] probably not but from my understanding
[03:50:51] of Luca if you want to play him on his
[03:50:53] own as like a carry or whatever you go
[03:50:54] crit and like like a sushang type of
[03:50:56] thing you go the physical set crit but
[03:50:58] this is like I'll include in the Kafka
[03:50:59] guide when you play a Hillary character
[03:51:02] like Luca or
[03:51:04] um sample or I think cerebral can work
[03:51:06] there you build them differently so like
[03:51:08] Luca and Sample you Luca example you
[03:51:10] won't go crit in a Kafka team you'll go
[03:51:13] attack because it's the dot damage that
[03:51:15] skills on his attack and [ __ ] so you
[03:51:17] yeah
[03:51:21] yeah
[03:51:22] you kind of change how you built him in
[03:51:24] a Kafka team
[03:51:28] oh this guy's Not Gonna Die
[03:51:30] I don't want to waste a turn so we are
[03:51:32] going to Alt
[03:51:37] not EHR you still need hit rate yeah hit
[03:51:40] use the one hit rate as well obviously
[03:51:42] is this guy gonna die or not I'm gonna
[03:51:44] use this skill point please die
[03:51:46] okay good
[03:51:52] I'm about to pog champ everywhere we'll
[03:51:55] do this then we're gonna uh this first
[03:51:59] gold
[03:52:03] sorry that was for Mariah I know you're
[03:52:04] watching Mariah hey
[03:52:06] love your editing okay sorry
[03:52:09] um
[03:52:10] kafka's next and BYU Bailey probably
[03:52:12] wants to heal so we can save a skill
[03:52:13] point but she has her Ultra we probably
[03:52:14] don't need a skill point okay cool
[03:52:18] please don't kill my Luca my Lucas
[03:52:20] that's fine don't kill Luca that did no
[03:52:23] damage
[03:52:36] I have to get more speed on Luca than
[03:52:37] Kafka um
[03:52:39] yes it's not like a need but yeah I do
[03:52:42] recommend because there's other ways
[03:52:44] like you can enter the combat with like
[03:52:45] your Technique or like you can yeah yeah
[03:52:48] you kind of want more speed like a
[03:52:50] little bit more
[03:52:51] but if your kafka's on like some insane
[03:52:54] amount of speed that you kind of can't
[03:52:59] but usually you would want to
[03:53:01] uh
[03:53:09] uh
[03:53:09] go first on your whoever applies the
[03:53:12] debuff
[03:53:21] oh my God
[03:53:23] the punches decide
[03:53:31] why don't you want to create stuff on
[03:53:32] Kafka dots don't crit a lot of damage
[03:53:35] comes from shock like or [ __ ] Lucas
[03:53:38] bleed or like windshield or whatever the
[03:53:39] [ __ ] you're doing so you don't want crit
[03:53:41] as much critical fine but you don't want
[03:53:43] it it's not as good
[03:53:50] so speed was better than attack that
[03:53:52] question will never have an answer in
[03:53:54] the history of honkai star rail it just
[03:53:56] depends it depends on literally
[03:53:57] everything but I like speed I'm a big
[03:53:59] speed enjoyer
[03:54:02] I might die here my characters are
[03:54:04] really light tree
[03:54:11] it's fine
[03:54:13] please bounce on Kafka okay well we
[03:54:16] didn't bounce on Kafka Sage
[03:54:25] you're so grumpy today do a jumping jack
[03:54:28] I'm not gonna do a jumping jack
[03:54:31] okay five gifted and I do a jumping jack
[03:54:37] good time to say bye
[03:54:42] good wording yeah oh David's a lot
[03:54:44] better do we also we didn't have bleed
[03:54:46] on them
[03:54:48] Lucas vault
[03:55:05] [Music]
[03:55:08] we save the cycle all right battle three
[03:55:11] we're gonna die we're way too low HP for
[03:55:13] this yeah we are [ __ ] also I don't
[03:55:14] have a cleanse what am I doing why am I
[03:55:16] not using Natasha I don't know that's
[03:55:17] actually a good question
[03:55:19] um well it was fun though this was fun
[03:55:22] to get this to get this far with Kafka
[03:55:25] um we are now going to the level Natasha
[03:55:28] is what we're gonna do that is what
[03:55:29] we're gonna do right now
[03:55:31] um so that we don't I mean okay I could
[03:55:33] play Lucha first half and then buy the
[03:55:35] second half but then I don't have
[03:55:44] no we kind of can't do that
[03:55:49] dude we need a Healer okay maybe we
[03:55:52] actually level Natasha
[03:55:53] it might actually be [ __ ] time it
[03:55:55] might be time
[03:55:59] we have enough we could actually level
[03:56:01] her
[03:56:06] just use a wind healer ah yes Gene
[03:56:19] York sword is like it did
[03:56:23] thank you I appreciate it
[03:56:30] what if I activate her E5 just to make
[03:56:33] it to where I don't need to level this
[03:56:34] talent because it's it's as if I have it
[03:56:36] leveled and I don't have to spend my
[03:56:37] resources
[03:56:42] foreign
[03:56:45] was that for the jumping jack dude why
[03:56:48] that surely that wasn't for the jumping

[04:01:27] we'll probably get another
[04:01:30] MC with Balu
[04:01:34] we could
[04:01:37] but then our damage is gonna be like
[04:01:38] pretty [ __ ]
[04:01:48] savor it for me
[04:01:54] repay
[04:01:56] Todd should we add a banned word in my
[04:01:58] chat that said that's drip hard and then
[04:02:00] anytime someone mentions him they get
[04:02:01] Auto modded
[04:02:04] time to say bye does blade and count
[04:02:07] your good together yes not on the team
[04:02:09] though
[04:02:12] and the story was kind of pog
[04:02:18] but in a team they don't really do much
[04:02:20] like each of them I think they're both
[04:02:22] really good I think blade is [ __ ]
[04:02:23] broken I think Kafka is pretty good in
[04:02:24] no Hillary teams but together kind of
[04:02:27] weird jump
[04:02:35] you took that picture the Yan chinga
[04:02:37] mode is the picture you took
[04:02:46] um
[04:02:53] okay [ __ ] it I'm e5ing my Natasha
[04:03:12] make drapard a banned word
[04:03:15] that's what I said I would do all right
[04:03:17] we're gonna give everything to Natasha
[04:03:18] [ __ ] You by Lou
[04:03:21] uh and surely this won't backfire

[04:03:33] I still can't ascender
[04:03:35] oh well back to the mines
[04:03:48] hello Mr XOXOX what do you say it's
[04:03:51] worth investing in the Himachal or not
[04:03:52] okay you want the honest answer or the
[04:03:55] honest answer
[04:03:57] I don't have himoko
[04:04:01] but when I look at her I would think
[04:04:04] that it's worth investing into her
[04:04:06] however her damage is not as astounding
[04:04:09] as certain other characters
[04:04:10] so the decision lies on you
[04:04:15] is hook better yeah
[04:04:19] but would I rather play himiko also yeah
[04:04:36] why did Cole memos do an announcement EU
[04:04:38] Frogs make sure to get some sleep it's
[04:04:40] getting late first of all no [ __ ] you

[04:16:45] foreign
[04:17:16] this tank ahead here no big deal no big
[04:17:19] deal no big deal yep no big deal no big
[04:17:21] deal no big deal may as well kill them
[04:17:23] all Kafka

[04:17:33] Altier so I can hopefully kill someone
[04:17:36] nice nice that actually helped a lot
[04:17:40] yeah that was [ __ ] huge
[04:17:42] good job Kafka uh this guy's not
[04:17:45] bleeding I can't wanna make him Bleak so
[04:17:46] we're gonna make him bleed

[04:18:20] need you let's go
[04:18:22] as much as I want to
[04:18:24] I think it's fine
[04:18:26] this combat needs Optima
[04:18:29] [Music]
[04:18:35] shot
[04:18:45] Good Times
[04:18:53] huh
[04:19:01] oh I [ __ ] up I said Natasha bursted ah
[04:19:04] my reaction time was too slow
[04:19:07] I do so I expressed it I pressed it I
[04:19:12] pressed it I pressed it but too slow
[04:19:15] dude I my reaction time okay it's fine I
[04:19:18] need to slow it down dude okay I think
[04:19:20] we play fire emcee though because we
[04:19:22] don't have enough healing
[04:19:24] maybe there's maybe we're just not why
[04:19:26] is there HP so low
[04:19:28] and I guess that's normal
[04:19:38] yeah it is kind of normal
[04:19:41] [ __ ] it we run it back
[04:19:43] Sealy time we get clear with silly but I
[04:19:45] don't want to clear silly I think we do
[04:19:48] to be fair solo isn't really doing that
[04:19:51] much
[04:19:52] like she is she is but I don't know if
[04:19:54] if we could probably just fire up and
[04:19:55] see and be fine
[04:20:00] wow these Talent levels are like super
[04:20:02] low
[04:20:04] I mean it doesn't matter it's [ __ ]

[04:20:13] Asta hasta is not a bad choice
[04:20:18] Stars give these Trailblazers your
[04:20:21] blessing
[04:20:27] the only problem with Asta is she's
[04:20:28] level 60.
[04:20:41] oh Stars give these Trailblazers your
[04:20:45] blessings
[04:20:47] that was pretty good was that not pretty
[04:20:49] good though
[04:20:51] like be honest was that not actually
[04:20:53] pretty good
[04:21:03] this is the fifth character he levels
[04:21:05] this stream aware okay listen what the
[04:21:07] [ __ ] is wrong with Asta
[04:21:19] stop typing aware okay what if we do
[04:21:26] we'll give her pilas
[04:21:28] wait we can just play pillow
[04:21:35] because our pillow is tanky
[04:21:39] but no never mind actually they don't
[04:21:41] have any
[04:21:44] I don't want people I also would yeah
[04:21:45] would help a lot here
[04:21:52] wait should we what if we buy Lou
[04:21:54] Natasha what a [ __ ] it
[04:21:57] we could Fire FC but my fire FC's kind
[04:22:00] of trashy she's level 70. with 2 600 hp
[04:22:06] which I guess is enough but I don't
[04:22:08] really trust it
[04:22:20] do we trust this to be useful enough
[04:22:23] we can try it we could try it
[04:22:25] [ __ ] it
[04:22:31] no um
[04:22:45] foreign

[04:24:42] taunt when I don't have to I think Tom
[04:24:44] here is kind of clutch
[04:24:46] just makes you not have to worry about
[04:24:47] anything and then I can use my skill
[04:24:48] points on [ __ ] like uh I actually don't
[04:24:51] even want to scalp on here

[04:25:41] three okay maybe maybe uh maybe we
[04:25:44] needed to taunt uh in that situation
[04:25:47] maybe in that situation taunting is
[04:25:48] better also bailu would actually damage
[04:25:50] their Shields Natasha doesn't but it's
[04:25:52] okay we have a cleanse

[04:29:25] gonna have to start plinking again
[04:29:30] I have to start blinking
[04:29:37] say bye to breathing because the thing
[04:29:39] with starrell is either I'm Auto
[04:29:42] battling which is whatever or I have to
[04:29:43] focus and if I have to focus I can't
[04:29:45] talk as much which means chat doesn't
[04:29:47] respond to me but does whatever they
[04:29:48] want and when Chad is left alone Chad is
[04:29:50] cringe I'm sorry in your natural element
[04:29:52] your cringe when you're like formatted
[04:29:55] by me you guys are cool but when it's
[04:29:57] like you guys are left alone it just
[04:29:59] devolves into cringe and star rail
[04:30:01] Harbors that
[04:30:02] it's not it is what it is like it is
[04:30:04] what it is it's not your fault it just
[04:30:05] is what it is
[04:30:09] if there's no in there's nothing to talk
[04:30:10] about Chad will just be like oh I want
[04:30:13] Kafka to
[04:30:14] eat my left pinky and then everyone says
[04:30:17] like huh and then someone doubles down
[04:30:18] on that and then it just
[04:30:20] blink stand still

[04:30:49] going back to My Lou
[04:30:56] or maybe I could have taunted actually
[04:30:58] maybe that was just okay one more try
[04:31:00] never mind maybe that was just a taunt
[04:31:01] issue maybe I should just press taunt
[04:31:04] maybe I could have just pressed on I
[04:31:06] wasn't really paying attention I was
[04:31:07] distracted okay one more one more one
[04:31:09] more one more one more ignore what I
[04:31:10] said about Natasha one more run maybe
[04:31:12] that was a skill issue maybe I should
[04:31:13] just taunted
[04:31:14] okay this time we're gonna spam taunt
[04:31:19] because I could just play [ __ ] silly
[04:31:21] and clear this but I am determined
[04:31:30] okay
[04:31:32] this time we make sure we actually time
[04:31:41] 's all about this
[04:31:46] I don't know how twitch works it doesn't
[04:31:56] wait why the [ __ ] did yeah okay well
[04:32:08] we just lost a cycle because we taunted
[04:32:10] because Auto Battle
[04:32:12] but fine
[04:32:26] okay
[04:32:27] it is now time
[04:32:30] should I pull for Kafka even though I
[04:32:32] have a built service
[04:32:36] uh uh it depends so not she's not at all
[04:32:41] similar in any way to those characters
[04:32:43] she's used in the ability teams
[04:32:45] basically only so if you want to play
[04:32:47] the Hillary you get Kafka if not nope
[04:32:50] I think she's worth it though because uh
[04:32:53] look at her
[04:33:04] good times I said I wanted the taunt but
[04:33:06] now that it's up to me I don't want to
[04:33:08] taunt anymore is that weird I don't want
[04:33:10] to spend the skill point haunting
[04:33:12] okay we'll just break his shield I
[04:33:13] surely I don't need to talk we'll be
[04:33:14] fine
[04:33:16] cool yes oh my god oh you didn't die
[04:33:22] still good though
[04:33:26] okay so where's the good stories are
[04:33:27] good
[04:33:30] it's fine
[04:33:33] nice we got the death Shred
[04:33:36] all right we should be able to win here
[04:33:38] I'm gonna heal myself because I don't
[04:33:39] wanna risk it
[04:33:42] let me go in
[04:33:46] say bye to breathing
[04:33:51] boom
[04:34:04] [Music]
[04:34:15] did earlier because he could have hit my
[04:34:17] Luca there and Luca might have died I
[04:34:19] don't actually know so maybe that was a
[04:34:20] misplay but it ended up being fine
[04:34:22] that's fine I think as long as I thought
[04:34:24] I don't die I don't think he hits all
[04:34:26] that maybe
[04:34:29] I should have altered first
[04:34:31] smart
[04:34:38] step out of it
[04:34:41] naughty child
[04:34:50] Lance Ablaze
[04:34:54] does he hit this much through the shield
[04:34:55] though oh my God that's [ __ ] sick
[04:34:57] okay dude last time that one shot or
[04:35:00] full HD Luca chill this kind of cracked
[04:35:01] uh we need to make sure we kill him
[04:35:02] before losing a cycle so we're gonna do
[04:35:05] this
[04:35:06] then Kafka e should kill if not refund
[04:35:09] okay I'm refunding everything
[04:35:13] minus one cycle
[04:35:19] fine we have more time to heal
[04:35:21] plan all planned copium
[04:35:25] it's actually better this way copium
[04:35:36] well at least one of them we're gonna
[04:35:36] apply bleed to the right one
[04:35:39] boom
[04:35:44] oh my God the one character we can't
[04:35:46] cleanse
[04:35:47] the one character we can't cleanse good
[04:35:50] times
[04:35:52] no they didn't raise the bleed
[04:35:55] fish is bleeding okay
[04:36:03] yeah she's not good well she is geared
[04:36:05] but we're not like Min Matt dude shut
[04:36:07] the [ __ ] up [ __ ] you we literally just
[04:36:09] leveled Natasha today okay today you
[04:36:12] can't expect me to also
[04:36:13] also however effect res min max okay
[04:36:16] that's cringe you're actually cringed at
[04:36:18] that point my my only my brawny is Max
[04:36:20] like that
[04:36:23] do I need the taunt no I'm fine
[04:36:29] I think I can tank one hit before I need
[04:36:30] to alt but uh I'm afraid something else
[04:36:58] this guy's getting [ __ ]
[04:37:02] please don't hit Luca please don't hit
[04:37:03] Luca okay we're good
[04:37:06] plan's easy
[04:37:09] are you [ __ ] [ __ ]
[04:37:11] you have got to be [ __ ] me
[04:37:15] oh I should have taunted
[04:37:17] it's fine the shield actually clutched
[04:37:18] okay we're fine
[04:37:19] I probably still should have taunted
[04:37:21] though
[04:37:23] well
[04:37:24] [Music]
[04:37:35] this game sucks okay it's more fun rash
[04:37:37] five
[04:37:42] full heal thank you Natasha oh my God
[04:37:45] she's [ __ ] how many times off the
[04:37:48] cleanser I can't play the game I
[04:37:50] literally can't play the game
[04:37:57] may as well Kill Them All
[04:38:00] Good Times time to say bye
[04:38:07] hey it's time honestly I'm so [ __ ] I
[04:38:11] need to apply bleed to them but I want
[04:38:12] to just [ __ ] taunt at this point like
[04:38:13] I'm like traumatized
[04:38:16] stand still the punches decide
[04:38:22] uh we might as well Focus here I'll be
[04:38:24] there [ __ ] it we're just gonna go all in
[04:38:25] on her because once one's dead it's a
[04:38:27] lot easier although calc is better on
[04:38:29] AOE so it's probably dumb but I don't
[04:38:31] care
[04:38:31] are you [ __ ] okay we didn't I thought
[04:38:33] she was gonna get stunned
[04:38:35] they're too good to me
[04:38:38] oh Cafe can use her skill here though
[04:38:40] that is terrible ah whatever
[04:38:45] unfortunate
[04:38:51] okay we should be fine now from this
[04:38:54] point onward we can just DPS say bye to
[04:38:56] breathing
[04:38:57] Good Times time to say bye oh she's not
[04:39:00] bleeding I should have waited for
[04:39:01] fraulting
[04:39:09] okay well the one character we can't
[04:39:10] dispel okay well that is uh that is fun
[04:39:16] can Natasha play She's the side she's my
[04:39:19] cleanser does this guy does she forget
[04:39:20] she's my cleanser
[04:39:22] my cleanser needs to cleanse
[04:39:30] oh do you guys is really low with
[04:39:31] [ __ ] fire emcee though
[04:39:34] I know we could have been unlucky I kind
[04:39:35] of missed it a little like I shouldn't
[04:39:37] have capitalized it earlier
[04:39:40] that's fine
[04:39:43] let's forward
[04:39:47] uh [ __ ] is next I can't use my skill
[04:39:49] here she's bleeding anyways it's fine
[04:39:51] all right we win
[04:39:55] wait what
[04:39:59] time to say bye
[04:40:04] I didn't mean to normal attack I was
[04:40:07] spamming spacebar because I meant I
[04:40:09] tried to alt on Luca but for some reason
[04:40:11] it didn't alt so it made me
[04:40:20] okay it's fine we saved the turn it
[04:40:22] doesn't matter it doesn't matter we got
[04:40:23] it okay
[04:40:24] oh whatever this team is so okay our
[04:40:27] second team is actually cracked we
[04:40:28] actually win here we actually went here
[04:40:29] actually went about actual actionable
[04:40:32] actionable
[04:40:34] actually winnable now thanks [ __ ]
[04:40:37] okay we need to make sure these guys are
[04:40:40] these no these guys don't respond right
[04:40:41] yeah no they don't revive these are the
[04:40:44] guys that do Mara struck
[04:40:46] so we need to make sure we
[04:40:49] oh no yeah rebirth that's where it is so
[04:40:51] we need to make sure we uh luocha all
[04:40:54] them before they die but I don't know if
[04:40:55] I'll have his Alt
[04:41:09] if my [ __ ] silver wolf dies here I'm
[04:41:12] going to scream and shout and let it all
[04:41:15] out and scream
[04:41:18] I will dispatch you we've entered the
[04:41:20] storm
[04:41:31] they might reborn because of this this
[04:41:33] might be a throw but I have to do it
[04:41:35] oh wait that's perfect we'll check it
[04:41:37] out
[04:41:38] no
[04:41:43] I'll see you off
[04:41:46] I needed launch it out but they [ __ ]
[04:41:49] made my blade
[04:41:51] yeah well this is minus one cycle
[04:41:56] wow that is so [ __ ] unlucky
[04:41:58] holy [ __ ]
[04:42:02] me whatever I guess
[04:42:08] you chose
[04:42:13] yo
[04:42:17] Eternal sleep
[04:42:19] yeah I minus one turn actually we went
[04:42:21] out to restart anymore surely we still
[04:42:23] get it though
[04:42:28] this combat needs optimizing uh I
[04:42:31] probably should have skill before this
[04:42:32] because we might Implement Quantum but
[04:42:33] it is what it is we're gonna Focus this
[04:42:34] guy
[04:42:37] then we do this
[04:42:39] okay we got quantum
[04:42:48] wait a moment
[04:42:51] blade moment
[04:42:54] that is a lot of damage
[04:42:57] a blade knows no mercy your end approach
[04:43:00] is
[04:43:01] unnecessary why is blade so I'm op he is
[04:43:04] and my blade is you know best in the
[04:43:06] world no big deal
[04:43:12] you took the bait
[04:43:14] time for a bug
[04:43:21] do I love blade
[04:43:25] hey I know we're fighting but
[04:43:29] wait Chad who are you supposed to focus
[04:43:31] here okay
[04:43:33] wait whoa okay I thought it was Auto
[04:43:34] Battle we have two cleanses so this is
[04:43:36] we're chilling
[04:43:37] um
[04:43:38] I don't want to kill kafko
[04:43:47] oh I should have brought you all did I
[04:43:49] didn't know what's gonna happen
[04:44:02] that paradise may be unreachable from
[04:44:05] savor it for me
[04:44:10] no
[04:44:12] I forgot to watch all Eternal sleep is
[04:44:14] not that's fine it doesn't matter it's
[04:44:15] only one revive but he's gonna die
[04:44:16] anyways to AOE it doesn't matter it
[04:44:18] literally doesn't matter blade is going
[04:44:19] to kill him possibly without him
[04:44:20] attacking it literally does not matter
[04:44:21] look he's about to die like he literally
[04:44:23] dies here just for me attacking Kafka
[04:44:26] okay well he's not gonna get hit off
[04:44:27] yeah he literally doesn't get hit off it
[04:44:29] doesn't matter it literally
[04:44:32] l-i-c-h-t-r-i-l-l-i doesn't matter look
[04:44:34] see he's dead boom
[04:44:40] UH 60
[04:44:42] seven six seven for 100 you don't need
[04:44:46] that
[04:44:47] wait as long as I don't die I win so
[04:44:50] let's make sure I don't die I'm not
[04:44:51] gonna use the skills I'm gonna make sure
[04:44:51] I can heal because we're gonna do the
[04:44:53] normal attack and then use our alt on
[04:44:55] Kafka to make sure we can kill her and
[04:44:56] then make sure we have enough
[04:45:00] we probably don't even need to use our
[04:45:02] skill but we're gonna use it just to be
[04:45:03] a good uh citizen this timer
[04:45:06] so you guys cannot kick WS now with his
[04:45:09] blades turn unfortunately I don't have
[04:45:10] enough skill points I just realized so
[04:45:12] this is going to be a tragedy but it's
[04:45:14] fine
[04:45:17] yeah I wish I could uh what's her name
[04:45:20] Brianna here all good
[04:45:23] oh my God sorry that was weird that was
[04:45:26] actually weird
[04:45:28] wait silver if I die oh no please no no
[04:45:31] no no no
[04:45:35] we've entered wait we win
[04:45:37] come on
[04:45:39] wait we actually win did you actually GG
[04:45:42] I'm gonna heal I'm not doing any chances
[04:45:44] but we actually just win
[04:45:48] [Applause]
[04:45:53] and I have fun this time
[04:45:55] first try zero deaths zero resets true
[04:46:02] can you just die already thank you
[04:46:05] true
[04:46:07] easy clap
[04:46:09] Natasha did actually come through
[04:46:11] Natasha pulled through Natasha actually
[04:46:12] pulled through hey we did with Kafka
[04:46:14] blade I don't think
[04:46:17] me
[04:46:19] Kafka blades iox name a better name a
[04:46:21] better Trio
[04:46:22] I'm like as cool as them look listen
[04:46:25] a blade knows no blade
[04:46:33] Michael
[04:46:37] that is a lot of credits
[04:46:41] okay that was kind of okay that made me
[04:46:42] sound like a whale if you notice the
[04:46:44] credits before the [ __ ] Jades you are
[04:46:45] too far gone that is actually weird
[04:46:47] champ I can't believe I said that I'm
[04:46:49] sorry I'm just broke on credits man I'm
[04:46:50] actually broke I actually need the
[04:46:52] credits I don't know man I don't know
[04:46:53] what's wrong with me
[04:46:58] now we just accumulate Jades until who's
[04:47:01] that like fushron or Dan hung too
[04:47:04] latest stupid OB he actually is now
[04:47:06] blade is actually like
[04:47:08] stupid
[04:47:10] but I love them
[04:47:13] can't even see his eye
[04:47:36] foreign
[04:47:43] stuff behind the scenes I don't know if
[04:47:45] I'll get the Guide out tonight or
[04:47:46] tomorrow probably tomorrow realistically
[04:47:48] but yeah
[04:47:50] 105 speed lull doesn't matter we're
[04:47:52] running for audio
[04:47:53] so we go blade and then bradio and then
[04:47:56] blade again now they could both be over
[04:47:57] one three four you get like blade to one
[04:47:59] three four and then brought it to one or
[04:48:01] 135 and then Brianna 134. that doesn't
[04:48:04] [ __ ] matter
[04:48:07] like
[04:48:08] to the people who are like it matters
[04:48:10] listen we cleared the Forgotten Hall
[04:48:12] with probably like 10 turns to spare if
[04:48:14] I wasn't a dumbass and our first team
[04:48:16] kind of sucked so like it literally just
[04:48:18] blade brought in then you can close your
[04:48:19] eyes or blade runny little close your
[04:48:21] eyes you don't even need a fourth
[04:48:22] character
[04:48:24] I want to play um I want to level sampo
[04:48:26] though
[04:48:27] on a level sample though but that's
[04:48:29] gonna take a while
[04:48:34] my blade is 104 my Brony is one three
[04:48:36] four okay listen
[04:48:38] no my brother used to be 134 but if
[04:48:41] you're playing Blade with brania you
[04:48:42] want your blade to go first because okay
[04:48:44] let's say let me simulate let me
[04:48:46] simulate your Universe okay Brian goes
[04:48:48] right she's like
[04:48:50] and then blade goes and then you just
[04:48:52] have one turn of blade alternatively
[04:48:55] blade goes first then bruh and then your
[04:48:58] blade goes again and then that's two
[04:48:59] blades instantly boom so you literally
[04:49:01] gain an extra blade turn
[04:49:04] [ __ ] I called her Kafka oh that's
[04:49:06] awkward
[04:49:07] I guess I'm not gonna talk to her hey
[04:49:09] welt
[04:49:16] all right
[04:49:38] jk9924 first message says zionics should
[04:49:41] cosplay brania how is that your first
[04:49:43] message
[04:49:44] how is that your first message
[04:49:55] we were using
[04:49:57] plus zero plus zero because who the [ __ ]
[04:50:00] cares
[04:50:02] crit damage body not even plus 15 plus
[04:50:05] nine head
[04:50:07] rope and then the best ball you've ever
[04:50:09] seen
[04:50:18] this being plus 14 is really triggering
[04:50:20] me I don't know why it's just looking at
[04:50:22] a 14 is tilting me we need to get this
[04:50:24] 15 but I don't have any [ __ ] relics
[04:50:28] it's like upsetting me to see it plus
[04:50:30] 14.
[04:50:31] I don't know if that's normal
[04:50:42] Curtis store oh yeah I forgot to claim
[04:50:44] these sometimes Saj
[04:50:50] Am I Ever Gonna use this
[04:50:54] box you should wear a suit on stream I
[04:50:56] probably will for uh Fontan release
[04:50:58] that's what I was planning Loki and then
[04:51:00] for the archon quest we'll do a mate
[04:51:02] outfit
[04:51:09] and hung too maybe
[04:51:12] Maybe
[04:51:15] it's actually not bad
[04:51:39] who's this
[04:51:41] abundance
[04:51:43] sniffer
[04:51:54] I like the Nook
[04:51:56] land's pretty cool too I thought his
[04:51:58] name was Ian I thought this is a capital
[04:52:00] i
[04:52:03] the [ __ ] is this
[04:52:12] um
[04:52:24] foreign
[04:52:39] changed it when she was pulling on our
[04:52:41] account and I literally can't unchange
[04:52:43] it it's literally locked for [ __ ]
[04:52:45] another 67 hours
[04:52:47] it got locked for 72 hours
[04:52:53] sure it's literally true
[04:52:57] why do I always have more achievements
[04:52:58] on this on kitchen
[04:52:59] [Laughter]
[04:53:03] anyways
[04:53:12] dude they gave Kafka and blade jiggle
[04:53:15] physics look they gave they literally
[04:53:17] this is the equality patch look
[04:53:20] yeah
[04:53:21] it's hard to see blade but see
[04:53:26] they also gave it to Kafka
[04:53:36] so yeah
[04:53:38] all right I need to go work on the Kafka
[04:53:40] guide if you guys are willing to wait it
[04:53:42] should be out either tonight or early
[04:53:43] tomorrow probably early tomorrow so I
[04:53:45] hope that's not too long uh there's some
[04:53:46] stuff I need to finalize like the team
[04:53:48] section and figuring out like I need to
[04:53:50] test serval I don't like I know she's
[04:53:52] good with Luca understood Kafka I
[04:53:54] haven't really played serval if there's
[04:53:55] anyone in Chad who has you can give me
[04:53:57] your experiences if not I'll probably
[04:53:58] just test it in my own time
[04:54:01] um
[04:54:02] but outside of that it will come out
[04:54:04] soon
[04:54:06] um
[04:54:09] she's good no I know circle's good I'm
[04:54:11] talking about with Kafka in particular
[04:54:12] that's what I'm talking about I know
[04:54:13] circle's good as a unit so I'm talking
[04:54:15] about with um
[04:54:17] with Kafka but outside of that it's
[04:54:19] gonna come out soon uh I'm just making
[04:54:21] sure everything's correct and true also
[04:54:23] if for those of you who don't know I
[04:54:24] talk about this very at the very start
[04:54:25] of the stream uh I accidentally recorded
[04:54:28] a few sections
[04:54:31] uh with my webcam so uh if you guys want
[04:54:34] to know what that sounds like give me a
[04:54:35] second
[04:54:36] because again my audio setup's a bit
[04:54:37] scuffed for this video so if you notice
[04:54:39] I'm it's still fine but it's like my
[04:54:41] current my good audio thing kind of the
[04:54:43] USB port is [ __ ] so I'm trying to see
[04:54:44] if I can get another one or like repair
[04:54:46] it anyways so I it put my default device
[04:54:49] to my webcam mic and so I recorded a
[04:54:52] section talking uh like this
[04:54:55] so uh you can listen right now
[04:55:01] so increase
[04:55:04] and then also apply shock have a hundred
[04:55:06] percent check
[04:55:09] so uh yeah I I had to redo a few
[04:55:11] sections because I recorded with my
[04:55:13] webcam
[04:55:16] and it's having 100 base chance to
[04:55:18] inflict
[04:55:22] yeah image but you'll also apply shock
[04:55:25] to the enemies I'm not keeping that
[04:55:29] it's so scuffed
[04:55:33] before release yeah I've been a [ __ ]
[04:55:36] Aquarium
[04:55:38] well yeah
