[00:53:23] need 15 more
[00:53:24] [Music]

[00:53:36] searches what level to L Goa we just
[00:53:39] started we started like [ __ ] 30

[00:59:57] what
[00:59:59] this okay I think
[01:00:01] the combat tip of the day is bench
[01:00:04] characters that have clunky animations
[01:00:06] and then anytime you cast something with
[01:00:08] an animation just swap cancel it you do
[01:00:10] a big thing on like [ __ ] Ellen

[01:09:50] going to die cuz I skipped like six
[01:09:51] meals so then I uh I went to like the
[01:09:54] cafeteria under the not cafeteria
[01:09:57] there's like a little like coffee shop
[01:09:59] under this hotel but it's kind of like a
[01:10:02] it's kind of like look I'm not going to
[01:10:03] lie it feels like a whale trap okay it
[01:10:05] feels like a a 10 mistakes to avoid for
[01:10:08] your uh zenis Zone zero account watch
[01:10:10] mojo.com don't make these mistakes or
[01:10:13] you ruin your account it felt overpriced
[01:10:15] I went up I'm like you know what I will
[01:10:17] literally die if I don't get food right
[01:10:18] now I don't care I ordered their ham and
[01:10:20] cheese sandwich you know it's overpriced
[01:10:22] because it was on charcoal bread who is
[01:10:25] is putting charcoal in their [ __ ]
[01:10:26] bread however I swear to God it was ham
[01:10:29] cheese charcoal bread I took a bite I
[01:10:32] almost [ __ ] sponsored the stream I
[01:10:36] almost ascended I Euphoria okay don't
[01:10:40] tell no lies about me I won't tell
[01:10:41] truths about you I gave a bite to Fang

[01:10:44] had in my life I gave Jake a bite I gave
[01:10:47] other person a bite they were everyone
[01:10:49] was like holy [ __ ] this is insane
[01:10:51] granted it was way too it was like a $10
[01:10:53] sandwich I I
[01:10:55] but I'm telling you it was like the best
[01:10:57] thing I ever had so I don't even know if
[01:10:58] it was worth it my point is if I spent
[01:11:01] $10 on that I could spend uh $100 on
[01:11:04] Ellen Joe thoughts thoughts thoughts
[01:11:06] thoughts I mean you could probably get
[01:11:07] her for free if you grind
[01:11:13] but that's not too bad I don't know I'm
[01:11:16] not I don't know what like a normal s
[01:11:18] like I'm used to Canadian
[01:11:20] [Music]
[01:11:21] prices I don't know I feel like cuz like
[01:11:25] I I I'm never like buying a ham and
[01:11:27] cheese like I feel like if I want ham
[01:11:28] and cheese I just make it at home like I
[01:11:29] just buy ham and
[01:11:31] cheese but I guess $10 downtown LA is

[03:03:24] harder part and then eventually the
[03:03:25] combat gets harder which is I enjoy but
[03:03:27] we're trying to get through that uh also
[03:03:29] I like a lot of the characters but we

[03:04:20] to get a bit of a better setup but for
[03:04:21] the 4.8 preview we'll just do whatever
[03:04:23] we can uh expect some content I'm going
[03:04:25] to record some stuff here going to get
