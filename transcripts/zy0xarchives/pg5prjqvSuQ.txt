[00:14:17] there's a device from King deshred
[00:14:19] civilization in this grave site I'll
[00:14:21] transmit the information over and
[00:14:23] project it for everyone to see isn't
[00:14:26] sharing knowledge against the academia's

[00:14:54] too can knowledge be its demise kind of
[00:14:57] quiet
[00:14:58] a disaster caught us unaware
[00:15:01] it was knowledge that did not belong to
[00:15:04] this world
[00:15:06] King deshrat brought this Forbidden
[00:15:08] Knowledge into our world and it quickly
[00:15:10] spread like a plague
[00:15:15] people's minds were filled with crazed
[00:15:18] Whispers dark gray scales spread across
[00:15:21] their bodies even the land was strict of
[00:15:24] its vigor only a death sounds like the
[00:15:27] song from nahida's Trailer things
[00:15:28] remained
[00:15:29] [Music]
[00:15:31] for greater Lord Ruka devata from the
[00:15:34] forests greater Lord Ruka Nevada
[00:15:38] she summoned the priests to build
[00:15:40] temples well it's nahida's Mom moved
[00:15:42] into them the divine power of life
[00:15:46] the disaster was miraculously tempered
[00:15:49] and the Embers of our civilization were
[00:15:52] preserved in aru village
[00:15:55] the last the miracle could not last as
[00:15:59] long as Forbidden Knowledge continued to
[00:16:01] exist it would forever blight this world
[00:16:05] in the end the proud King of the desert
[00:16:08] my
[00:16:10] eternal Lord chose to sacrifice himself
[00:16:15] I have spent my whole life since
[00:16:18] guarding one of these many temples
[00:16:21] now my duty is coming to an end
[00:16:27] as I close my eyes for the final time
[00:16:30] the sight of that Noble deity will
[00:16:33] appear in my vision once more
[00:16:36] in helping King deshret to eradicate
[00:16:39] Forbidden Knowledge she exhausted her
[00:16:42] strength and her form became that of a
[00:16:45] small child
[00:16:47] strange oh now that I think I no longer
[00:16:52] have any fear of death for I sense that
[00:16:55] the spirit of life will abide with me
[00:16:58] during my eternal sleep
[00:17:02] Children of the desert cling no longer
[00:17:05] to past grievances

[00:24:46] without so
[00:24:47] your superiors are busy recently
[00:24:51] why what are they trying to accomplish
[00:24:54] uh they um wanted to extract well this

[00:25:07] asking they extract Divine canned

[00:25:14] I I really don't know how to explain it
[00:25:17] well you better start talking or you'll
[00:25:19] be you don't want to make things any
[00:25:21] more difficult for yourself do ya may I
[00:25:23] ask them a question
[00:25:26] about a talk nope she's not the sages
[00:25:29] are trying to create a new God aren't
[00:25:30] they uh-oh uh oh scaramukey
[00:25:34] wait what the [ __ ]
[00:25:37] it sure didn't sound like a fancy
[00:25:39] metaphor or anything you're serious
[00:25:41] aren't you
[00:25:42] how did you know
[00:25:46] there's no use hiding it now yes you're
[00:25:49] right there's no use hiding it is
[00:25:51] working on an important and potentially
[00:25:53] world-changing project can we kill him
[00:25:55] he's annoying just talk to his friend
[00:25:56] bro just kill him God that will belong
[00:25:58] to them and to the people of sumeru it
[00:26:01] may seem as if sumeru's academics are
[00:26:03] thriving but ever since the death of
[00:26:05] Greater Lord Ruka devata scholarly
[00:26:07] breakthroughs have been few and far
[00:26:09] between the withering of Urban Soul has
[00:26:11] been getting worse recently the sages
[00:26:13] dude can't we ever visit a nation why do
[00:26:16] we have to save the nation from the god
[00:26:18] or the people why can't we just visit
[00:26:20] like oh welcome to Fontana
[00:26:22] and then we just chill and we have a
[00:26:24] good time why do we have to save every
[00:26:26] problem in the world bro like what is
[00:26:28] this someone from the fatou showed up
[00:26:31] they called him the doctor the doctor a
[00:26:34] gnosis and said he wanted to borrow the
[00:26:36] academia's research facilities the
[00:26:39] doctor was previously expelled from the
[00:26:40] Academia at first the sages looked down
[00:26:43] at him and disdain but when he said
[00:26:45] those words everyone's expression
[00:26:48] changed he asked them do you wish to
[00:26:51] create a god
[00:26:52] this is what the Arrogant ignorance at
[00:26:54] the extreme end of Academia looks like
[00:26:57] first
[00:26:59] spent a long time constructing a Divine
[00:27:01] vessel which was based on an Exquisite
[00:27:03] human yes scaramouche's boss we all saw
[00:27:05] the trailer
[00:27:06] service of Dreams maximizing the output
[00:27:09] and the Akasha now functioning at
[00:27:12] maximum efficiency they were able to use
[00:27:14] it to extract the power from the gnosis
[00:27:16] and convert it into a Divine core next
[00:27:19] they decided that their new God Divine
[00:27:22] wisdom I don't want to hear him talk I'm
[00:27:23] sorry
[00:27:24] okay how do you determine whether the
[00:27:27] knowledge extracted is of divine origin
[00:27:29] call it an educated guess
[00:27:31] Academia has been trying to figure out
[00:27:33] the exact source of the scholars Madness
[00:27:34] for centuries but to no avail
[00:27:37] no no explain the cause of this
[00:27:39] phenomenon surely you can see what that
[00:27:41] implies describe elhitham if it's
[00:27:43] knowledge no mortal can comprehend then
[00:27:45] it must be something only gods are able
[00:27:47] to decipher in other words
[00:27:50] it's the source of the god of wisdom's
[00:27:52] omniscience and omnipotence
[00:27:54] [Music]
[00:27:58] but the sages and won't be greater lewd
[00:28:00] record Nevada it will be the balladeer
[00:28:02] you must have noticed by now oh my god
[00:28:04] he has three names
[00:28:06] it's the ability to exercise
[00:28:11] it is as if they are cursed with a
[00:28:13] desire performance that burns in their
[00:28:16] blood
[00:28:17] some organisms demonstrate phototaxis
[00:28:19] and what the [ __ ] is phototaxis lives
[00:28:22] and respect sources of light
[00:28:24] for the sages the [ __ ] is a photo taxes
[00:28:27] is that what plants do when they like
[00:28:30] eat the light this is but a form of
[00:28:32] phototaxis
[00:28:34] for many scholars the absence of a god
[00:28:37] of wisdom means stumbling in the
[00:28:38] darkness for the duration of their lives
[00:28:40] then what does lesser Lord kusanali mean
[00:28:43] to you is she not a true God present in
[00:28:45] this world
[00:28:47] if you already have a new God true from
[00:28:50] the beginning the Academia has never
[00:28:52] treated her as a god when the Academia
[00:28:54] first discovered lesser Lord kusanali
[00:28:56] the newborn god of wisdom the sages
[00:28:59] hoped that she would be as wise as
[00:29:01] greater Lords
[00:29:03] but upon a value it surely just waited
[00:29:05] for her to grow up at the time she
[00:29:06] possessed no more intelligence than any
[00:29:08] ordinary human child
[00:29:10] Russian grow up just chill this force
[00:29:14] them to accept that greater Lord Ruka
[00:29:15] devada had indeed passed away
[00:29:18] not to mention that lesser Lord
[00:29:20] kusanali's gnosis had been used to power
[00:29:23] the Akasha this entire time by herself
[00:29:26] she has neither an archon's raw power
[00:29:28] nor the spectacular Insight expected of
[00:29:30] a god of wisdom
[00:29:32] slowly but surely people began to forget
[00:29:34] about her existence
[00:29:36] so
[00:29:37] this is the path the sages have chosen
[00:29:42] so she used to acknowledge I never
[00:29:44] imagined a God could be subjected to
[00:29:46] such cruelty all right let's try to keep
[00:29:48] our cool if everyone's in a bad mood
[00:29:50] then let's change up our scenery Rahman
[00:29:53] give me a few men to help us escort The
[00:29:55] Village Keepers back to the Village sure

[00:30:25] has a dedicated caregiver after them
[00:30:28] the two new Scholars are being kept
[00:30:29] under close supervision
[00:30:34] but everything on circus and Ali has
[00:30:35] done for the people the academy has a
[00:30:37] better that's actually cool even though
[00:30:38] she's protected never really like
[00:30:39] assault okay he said something okay come

[00:31:20] conversation at all
[00:31:23] am I dumb I kind of forget what we were
[00:31:25] telling them
[00:31:26] I forget what we've been withholding

[00:38:41] achieve anything if we're simply careful
[00:38:43] we must go beyond that and fully commit
[00:38:46] ourselves to it
[00:38:48] sure I hope this is clear to you can you
[00:38:50] repeat it again please

[00:39:11] plan
[00:39:12] [Music]
[00:39:14] well of course
[00:39:16] compared to the mercenaries I'm merely a
[00:39:18] feeble scholar wait what did the
[00:39:19] mercenary oh yeah I guess we've seen
[00:39:20] them
[00:39:21] but the advantage can we get can we pull
[00:39:23] for a mercenary then I get to stay in a
[00:39:25] safer place and offer my strategic
[00:39:27] insight
[00:39:28] just think about that mercenary who lost
[00:39:30] his mind
[00:39:31] mercenary groups are facing constant
[00:39:34] danger every single day
[00:39:39] I like his like coat thing it's pretty
[00:39:41] lit
[00:39:43] I'm not like the rest of them okay sure
[00:39:46] I'll hit them you're different same
[00:39:47] species some will exhibit far more
[00:39:49] potential than others you're not like
[00:39:50] the other guys I know I'm sure I'll hit
[00:39:52] them
[00:39:55] all intellectuals or lunatics in the
[00:39:57] eyes of fools I'll take that as a
[00:40:00] compliment true do you remember the
[00:40:03] record we saw in the king Deseret ruins
[00:40:05] it forbidden knowledge
[00:40:08] it's the Dory team chat the forbidden
[00:40:10] knowledge is the child Dory team comp
[00:40:12] that no one wants to admit the child
[00:40:15] Dory double dendro it's the Forbidden
[00:40:17] team it's Forbidden Knowledge nobody
[00:40:20] wants to do it because nobody wants a
[00:40:21] level Dory it's forbidden you have a
[00:40:24] good memory it's the fully wrote the
[00:40:26] whole rotation is there in that document
[00:40:27] insane but this fact has never been
[00:40:30] shared with the public true even I who
[00:40:32] has worked in the Academia for some time
[00:40:34] was never once informed of this I think
[00:40:37] those mad Scholars and mercenaries we
[00:40:40] encountered may have all Fallen victim
[00:40:42] to the corrupting qualities of forbidden
[00:40:44] knowledge but the Academia has always
[00:40:46] held a different view they have always
[00:40:48] believed that symptoms of Madness are a
[00:40:50] side effect of human contact with Divine
[00:40:52] knowledge as mere mortals come to think
[00:40:55] of it perhaps the Academia has also
[00:40:58] never understood the true nature of
[00:41:00] forbidden Forbidden Knowledge always
[00:41:02] approach the issue okay fair enough
[00:41:03] withering al-azhar sandstorms and the
[00:41:06] sandstorms don't you think what is
[00:41:09] happening right now across sumero is
[00:41:11] rather similar to The Forbidden
[00:41:13] Knowledge pollution that occurred in the
[00:41:15] desert thousands of years ago but
[00:41:20] that's what tainari told us wait a
[00:41:23] second ah you've come you've connected
[00:41:25] the dots
[00:41:26] cause of urban Soul's illness May
[00:41:28] precisely be the pollution from
[00:41:30] forbidden knowledge
[00:41:32] but if that's the case what should we I
[00:41:35] have a dumb question about two of us
[00:41:36] chat let me Google it
[00:41:38] one sec
[00:41:42] oh okay
[00:41:49] I forgot what Urban Soul was but I
[00:41:51] Googled it we're fine it's the tree
[00:41:52] thing that connects life wow okay cool
[00:42:02] I was like is that a person is that like
[00:42:05] a thing like is that an area like did we
[00:42:07] visit Urban we're good now she said the
[00:42:09] key to saving our midsole is contained
[00:42:11] within the remaining consciousness of
[00:42:13] Greater Lord Rook of Nevada
[00:42:20] the world forget me thing
[00:42:24] in that case it's imperative that we
[00:42:27] rescue lesser Lord cousin Ali only by
[00:42:30] working with her to save erminsul can we
[00:42:32] completely to make sure we're still on
[00:42:34] track I would like to check on the state
[00:42:36] of some of your Preparatory work to an
[00:42:39] aeromite base oh I'm down
[00:42:43] all right we have a date we're meeting
[00:42:44] I'll hide them at a base
[00:42:53] start pronouncing Tiffany in a Southern
[00:42:55] Mississippi accent what even would that
[00:42:57] be
[00:42:59] Brothers
[00:43:02] that was probably terrible
[00:43:14] I can't wait we can find this
[00:43:20] laughs
[00:43:24] oh you made it
[00:43:28] I gave them some technical work to do ah
[00:43:34] you traveler I see
[00:43:35] wait so they work for I'll hide them now
[00:43:38] we just captured them and now they work
[00:43:40] for us
[00:43:41] ah yes we have fixed the devices
[00:43:43] according to your instructions one of
[00:43:45] them is already ready for use while the
[00:43:47] others are still under repair you know
[00:43:48] why is everyone redeeming minus 10K
[00:43:52] you're not getting anything for your 10K
[00:43:54] points
[00:43:55] look here
[00:43:58] huh
[00:44:02] wait can I redeem it myself but I can
[00:44:04] that's pretty funny what's that look on
[00:44:06] your face
[00:44:07] are you scared
[00:44:13] that's an interesting response anyway
[00:44:16] we're not going to use this just yet as
[00:44:19] I mentioned during the during the
[00:44:20] meeting the knowledge capsules contain a
[00:44:22] decree sorry the past
[00:44:25] their own copy
[00:44:27] and according to the plan we just came
[00:44:29] up I don't want to skip a heighten but I
[00:44:30] don't discuss the last six hours I want
[00:44:32] you to record something into this
[00:44:33] capsule
[00:44:35] wait what are we recording bro we can
[00:44:36] save Lester Lord kusanali yes good
[00:44:39] conviction is the most important but
[00:44:41] he's so pretty and for what
[00:44:42] can you come on the bat already this
[00:44:44] device
[00:44:51] yes
[00:44:53] hymen is still really worried I
[00:44:55] understand but trust me pymon this is
[00:44:58] something we have to do because to
[00:45:01] achieve this impossible task it sounds
[00:45:03] like you'll need to fool your own heart
[00:45:04] first
[00:45:05] although it may feel like a trick
[00:45:07] self-encouragement may be the most
[00:45:09] important tool we have
[00:45:18] Imagine This
[00:45:20] we have orchestrated our plan and
[00:45:22] successfully rescued lesser Lord
[00:45:24] kusanali as a result we have changed
[00:45:27] sumeru's entire political landscape
[00:45:29] everything went without a hitch and
[00:45:32] everyone recognizes and Praises our
[00:45:34] achievements
[00:45:36] okay now open your eyes
[00:45:38] hey all hi thumb hey
[00:45:41] here
[00:45:44] what read it out loud
[00:45:50] although you don't quite understand the
[00:45:52] purpose of this recording you still feel
[00:45:53] it's done
[00:45:55] is your head okay
[00:45:58] still recording there should be no
[00:46:00] negative effects
[00:46:03] and that's perfectly
[00:46:07] what have you forgotten
[00:46:08] our plan needs to account for those who
[00:46:10] have long relied on the Akasha you may
[00:46:13] find it hard to believe but for those
[00:46:15] people everything the Akasha transmits
[00:46:18] to them is nothing short of absolute
[00:46:20] truth
[00:46:21] imagine if you've been using a device
[00:46:23] like the Akasha since the day while born
[00:46:25] and this device has always supported you
[00:46:28] during times of need after all that time
[00:46:31] what do you think you'd become uh
[00:46:37] true slave to orders true and that's why
[00:46:40] rules are so important if you want to
[00:46:43] order me around understand the rules can
[00:46:45] delineate boundaries and identify gray
[00:46:47] areas true
[00:46:50] why would you need to identify the gray
[00:46:52] areas you could say that those kinds of
[00:46:55] ambiguous zones can be very interesting
[00:46:58] one might even say they're advantageous
[00:47:01] in the right hands things you're
[00:47:03] interested in are really anyway that's
[00:47:06] enough Chit Chat I'm going to take those
[00:47:08] two to work that's enough people talk
[00:47:09] all right we're gonna do small projects
[00:47:11] cool all right let's go we're going to
[00:47:13] Tink
[00:47:14] Tinker the Akasha terminal sounds good
[00:47:16] peace all right where are we going meet
[00:47:17] up with Sino dude [ __ ] I have a date
[00:47:19] with every character
[00:47:30] I thought we agreed on a plan
[00:47:33] but he's so tall the plan is too radical
[00:47:37] and carries a high risk for casualties
[00:47:40] I've given it a lot of thought
[00:47:42] and in the end
[00:47:44] I still can't agree to it
[00:47:46] but it's still the best plan we have
[00:47:50] is a former Mantra you of all people
[00:47:52] should be able to see the bigger picture
[00:47:54] and recognize the innate advantages of
[00:47:56] our plan I did and that's how I saw the
[00:48:00] danger Behind These so I'll hide I'll
[00:48:02] hate those plan is more radical whoa
[00:48:04] that's radical bro oh Wicked
[00:48:08] my friend you're just in time persuades
[00:48:11] I know I bet we agreed to work out a
[00:48:14] plan at the meeting
[00:48:15] as mercenaries you're familiar with the
[00:48:18] local environment so you'll take care of
[00:48:20] the specifics
[00:48:22] but then you went to all hate them for
[00:48:25] suggestions
[00:48:26] had I known all Haytham would give you
[00:48:28] those kinds of suggestions
[00:48:33] look you already know that we're all on
[00:48:35] the same side here true mercenaries
[00:48:38] place a lot of importance on their bonds
[00:48:40] of friendship
[00:48:41] but also will not hesitate to make
[00:48:44] sacrifices if they deem the situation to
[00:48:46] be sufficiently dire
[00:48:50] and sorry
[00:48:51] but as things stand
[00:48:53] I can't accept your principles
[00:48:56] [Music]
[00:48:57] do understand the ways of the desert
[00:49:01] Traveler pymon this is also something
[00:49:04] you should know raman's plan is to have
[00:49:07] me work with the Caravan Reebok guards
[00:49:09] in my capacity as a mantra
[00:49:11] we will arrest The Mercenaries and
[00:49:13] escort them into sumeru City
[00:49:16] wait how can we can't get through that
[00:49:19] wall easily remember Caravan reebot
[00:49:22] would never let so many unregistered
[00:49:24] members of the aeromites enter my plan
[00:49:26] do you have any possible suspicion and
[00:49:29] also let us enter the cities a big group
[00:49:31] there is no better way that also sounds
[00:49:35] like something all Haytham told you am I
[00:49:38] right
[00:49:40] of course he does he told me there is no
[00:49:45] perfect plan but this can get the job
[00:49:48] done true professor said that with the
[00:49:50] help of Sino and could call me fan our
[00:49:52] chance of success would increase
[00:49:54] significantly I never blindly trust
[00:49:56] anyone and I've always had a good eye
[00:49:58] for people if I make the arrests alone
[00:50:01] I can control myself and prevent you
[00:50:03] from getting hurt
[00:50:05] but I can't guarantee that kind of
[00:50:07] discipline to ten months to make the
[00:50:10] whole thing more convincing
[00:50:11] to some degree Coco Deo casualties are
[00:50:15] never I'm okay with the deaths of
[00:50:17] enemies
[00:50:19] but now that we're allies
[00:50:21] I'm against them you just want to arrest
[00:50:23] them instead of having the guards arrest
[00:50:24] them
[00:50:25] I can't believe a mantra would actually
[00:50:27] care about us
[00:50:30] and I can say that people like you are
[00:50:33] hard to come by
[00:50:35] because it wasn't surprised my allies
[00:50:37] with honesty and respect
[00:50:40] they have the people making this hard
[00:50:42] hey is there something we can do to help
[00:50:44] I can help I know what I'm doing I knew
[00:50:47] you would say that
[00:50:47] [Music]
[00:50:49] fight some of the mercenaries which
[00:50:51] should
[00:50:52] ERS you'll have to struggle with the
[00:50:54] guards that should help at least we
[00:50:57] should respect the determination of
[00:50:58] Raman and his comrades
[00:51:00] comrade I thank you
[00:51:04] but this
[00:51:06] Axon
[00:51:08] we strongly value true lives of our
[00:51:11] friends
[00:51:12] I literally called it I said this guy's
[00:51:14] gonna die for a greater cause because
[00:51:16] yeah he had a Redemption art from
[00:51:17] someone you're like kind of I don't
[00:51:18] really like to Giga Chad that now is
[00:51:20] gonna die for us it's true true
[00:51:24] now that you've put it that way I can no
[00:51:27] longer refuse but remember
[00:51:30] you need to follow the plan and not do
[00:51:32] anything Reckless
[00:51:34] Candace made it very clear that we can
[00:51:36] only achieve our goals if we can ensure
[00:51:39] our safety so truth I know and I both
[00:51:42] recognize the significance of this
[00:51:43] operation
[00:51:45] there should be no more animosity true
[00:51:47] okay you have a deal
[00:51:50] the guard should be stationed in the
[00:51:52] courtyard nearby you can find them there
[00:51:55] can I kill them all
[00:51:58] can I go kill all the guards guards
[00:52:03] sorry I was yelling voice acting bro
[00:52:07] okay
[00:52:08] cool
[00:52:12] guards General mahamatra to to what do
[00:52:16] we owe the awesome whips his [ __ ] out
[00:52:18] boom they're dead keep your voice down
[00:52:20] oh never mind this is secret operation
[00:52:22] I'm going to arrest a large criminal
[00:52:24] gang near this location
[00:52:27] genius guide and regulations on secret
[00:52:29] operations dude that's how you assert
[00:52:31] dominance the enemies are like what are
[00:52:33] you doing here boom whips it out they're
[00:52:35] like oh of course my bad sir and then
[00:52:36] they run away true that's the AL Haytham
[00:52:39] story Quest I just spoiled it the AL
[00:52:41] Haytham friendship a hangout that's what
[00:52:43] happened so make sure you do it get
[00:52:45] friendship 10 to unlock that part of the
[00:52:46] quest and verify your yes option we may
[00:52:49] need to report it to our superiors
[00:52:50] they're a squad of air mites whose
[00:52:52] number is comparable to einel akmar and
[00:52:55] port ormos
[00:52:56] they're involved in the theft and resale
[00:52:58] of supplies from the Academia
[00:53:02] this should definitely be classified as
[00:53:04] a joint operation and I suggest that you
[00:53:06] report this to your superiors as soon as
[00:53:08] possible and treat it as a top priority
[00:53:11] dessert operation got it please wait a
[00:53:14] moment I'll contact them immediately
[00:53:18] gate what's this guy's name gate as a
[00:53:20] guard that's uh
[00:53:22] that's such a guard name it's like
[00:53:24] you're destined to be a guard
[00:53:25] because this is work it's like Chad do
[00:53:28] you think of Chance the Rapper if you
[00:53:30] think you think of his parents didn't
[00:53:31] name him Chance the Rapper he'd still be
[00:53:32] a rapper like it was literally in his
[00:53:34] name because I trust you I can't believe
[00:53:37] you're
[00:53:43] between
[00:53:46] superiors might write we discussed this
[00:53:49] remember true
[00:53:52] the Caravan reebot operation is of great
[00:53:54] importance but don't worry the guards
[00:53:57] there shouldn't know that some
[00:53:58] investigate the flight attendant
[00:54:01] be so sure
[00:54:04] first the other Mantra I don't know why
[00:54:07] Sino is left which proves that the
[00:54:09] Academia has been covering up the matter
[00:54:10] true second second thank you guys I'm so
[00:54:13] true for the academius god creation plan
[00:54:15] if something were to happen to the
[00:54:18] general mahamatra it's bound to attract
[00:54:20] a lot of unwanted attention yeah no
[00:54:23] matter how you look at it they don't
[00:54:24] seem interested in sharing the news
[00:54:26] sorry I was distracted can you repeat
[00:54:27] that again a reasonable inference
[00:54:30] I agree you mind if I take a melon from
[00:54:32] the table or next issue
[00:54:34] I'm sure some of you is that a giant
[00:54:36] blueberry a certain function of the
[00:54:37] Akasha will affect our operation our
[00:54:39] operations still in operation so I must
[00:54:43] remain on high alert
[00:54:44] actually
[00:54:46] considering the power of the Akasha
[00:54:50] it's quite strange that it hasn't
[00:54:53] already tried to interfere with my
[00:54:55] actions I've given that a lot of thought
[00:54:58] for now I don't think you'll need to
[00:55:00] worry if you remember when you first
[00:55:03] came to aru Village all your actions
[00:55:05] were predicted by the Akasha it even
[00:55:08] gave that information to those who
[00:55:10] kidnapped what's the conclusion from
[00:55:11] that uh statement things like that never
[00:55:14] happened again after we met up with the
[00:55:15] travel true which means that's true
[00:55:19] but why look at it from a different
[00:55:22] angle okay why do you think what angle
[00:55:24] do you want to predict your actions
[00:55:26] because my personal data has been
[00:55:28] entered into the Akasha
[00:55:30] that's true but the key to this question
[00:55:33] is how well can the Akasha make
[00:55:36] predictions about a person
[00:55:38] haven't you ever thought about it just
[00:55:40] how can it do this in the first place
[00:55:42] because the Akasha controls the entirety
[00:55:45] of sumero
[00:55:47] the Academia firmly believes that all
[00:55:50] human actions can be explained through
[00:55:51] logic True by sorting and analyzing
[00:55:54] enter data the Akasha can derive
[00:55:56] behavioral logic and predict the actions
[00:55:58] of those who fit in existing logic model
[00:56:01] however at the risk of sounding like an
[00:56:03] advocate for fallacies can everyone
[00:56:05] truly be considered logical at all times
[00:56:08] emotions are part of our behavioral
[00:56:10] logic but can you guarantee that every
[00:56:13] experience of the same Joy or pain would
[00:56:15] be equally intense how can our feelings
[00:56:18] and opinions be predictable down to the
[00:56:20] letter in every single instance
[00:56:23] hmm
[00:56:25] Sino in the past you've always worked
[00:56:29] alone this is kind of way too nice of
[00:56:31] another person who could sway you or
[00:56:33] your thoughts the Akasha could produce
[00:56:35] predictions that were similar to your
[00:56:37] real life behavioral principles
[00:56:39] decisive and principled you were used to
[00:56:42] solving problems alone that's why the
[00:56:45] Akasha could figure you out
[00:56:47] but now you've joined a team
[00:56:50] and I believe the economy yeah
[00:56:52] still playing old meta they're still
[00:56:54] playing national team when national team
[00:56:56] instead of sucrose true they're still
[00:56:58] playing that team together to become a
[00:57:00] complicated chaotic they haven't they
[00:57:02] haven't watched the newest videos
[00:57:03] potentially disagree with another
[00:57:05] you're still playing morgana's
[00:57:07] interactions and it's impossible for it
[00:57:09] to predict your actions in the future
[00:57:11] based on your decisions in the past
[00:57:12] after all there's probably a limit to
[00:57:16] just how much we can be modeled or
[00:57:17] controlled by data
[00:57:19] so in my opinion you're probably safe
[00:57:22] for now makes sense to me I agree the
[00:57:27] Akasha is not alive and I don't think we
[00:57:29] can be completely controlled by
[00:57:31] something without a mind of its own okay
[00:57:33] sure
[00:57:34] I guess there are things that even the
[00:57:36] Akasha cannot calculate
[00:57:38] and people will not be forever trapped
[00:57:40] by the past true
[00:57:42] okay that was uh next through a long
[00:57:45] cutscene but sure attention during our
[00:57:47] meetings
[00:57:50] that he just got roasted get [ __ ] by
[00:57:52] one remember to stay vigilant
[00:57:58] General mahamatra we were not expecting
[00:58:01] your presence here
[00:58:02] I'm the security officer of the Grand
[00:58:04] deshret Desert District my name is

[00:58:27] Academia
[00:58:28] this is kind of a giga Chad
[00:58:30] have you made a decision regarding the
[00:58:32] matter I mentioned to your subordinate
[00:58:34] it seems to be a dire situation so of
[00:58:37] course you will have our full
[00:58:38] cooperation to be perfectly honest I've

[01:09:05] lesser Lord kusanali dealing with an
[01:09:07] institution that controls all of sumera
[01:09:09] who is already hard enough if the doctor

[01:09:23] right hearing his name just reminds me
[01:09:25] these are kind of cute on the Academia
[01:09:28] I'd rather not have to deal with someone
[01:09:30] like that okay the McDonald's near me
[01:09:31] dude it's a 50 50. it also depends I
[01:09:34] don't know which one's a good one
[01:09:35] anymore it's hard I can check but the
[01:09:37] McDonald's near me
[01:09:39] says good on doordash is like usually
[01:09:41] bad but the reasons is closed I have to
[01:09:42] do donuts but it's literally 50 50.
[01:09:45] either it's like the freshest most
[01:09:47] Divine thing I've ever had or it's like
[01:09:49] super stale like literally hard and like
[01:09:51] cold it's a 50 50. and I don't know why
[01:09:54] it's always a 50 50.
[01:10:01] well it's actually gotcha
[01:10:03] the thing is when I eat McDonald's it
[01:10:04] like kills my productivity I just like
[01:10:06] lay down after and die but that's only
[01:10:07] if I get everything what if I only get
[01:10:08] nuggies dude [ __ ] fries
[01:10:10] are good but like it kills me I feel
[01:10:12] like
[01:10:13] huge

[01:11:01] [Music]

[01:11:10] tainari

[01:11:13] solid then we can be sure that tainari's

[01:16:07] [Music]
[01:16:09] yeah he came looking for me
[01:16:11] can I ask what it was about
[01:16:14] sorry to ask you like this after having
[01:16:16] just met but your answer McDonald's is
[01:16:19] so expensive for now all we can share
[01:16:22] with you is that your friend Sino is
[01:16:24] working with us
[01:16:27] Sino you say
[01:16:29] [Music]
[01:16:32] I see
[01:16:33] so that's why he hasn't been at the
[01:16:35] Academia okay
[01:16:37] I will answer your questions and Melissa
[01:16:40] this game really does work wonders
[01:16:42] you're not even a little worried that we
[01:16:44] might this guy's actually dude they're
[01:16:46] actually I don't care okay is this why
[01:16:48] my entire timeline is just [ __ ] says
[01:16:51] no kissing is this why dude what is this
[01:16:54] Quest he is the type that would conspire
[01:16:55] to deceive me
[01:16:57] you mentioned Sino he's all flustered
[01:16:59] I'll also get straight to the point
[01:17:02] The Harbinger you mentioned came to me
[01:17:04] because he wanted to take the scholar
[01:17:06] hepatia away with him
[01:17:12] and what do you mean by take away is he
[01:17:14] planning to leave sumeru
[01:17:17] yes he told me his return to snesh
[01:17:20] Naya's eminent
[01:17:24] whoa whoa whoa whoa
[01:17:27] so you mean
[01:17:30] you're leaving this place soon
[01:17:33] indeed otherwise we could have perhaps
[01:17:35] talked a little more
[01:17:38] I was just about to set out when I
[01:17:39] remembered something important to that
[01:17:42] end I made a final trip to pardis Di
[01:17:45] let me ask have you been taking care of
[01:17:47] a scholar by the name of hapasia your
[01:17:50] sources are accurate
[01:17:52] no doubt because you recruited many
[01:17:54] informants
[01:17:56] but you're right apagia has indeed been
[01:17:59] receiving treatment from me forgive me
[01:18:01] for asking but how's the treatment
[01:18:03] coming along given the way you're asking
[01:18:07] I assume you have something to say since
[01:18:10] you asked I'll be frank I would like to
[01:18:12] take capacia to sneshnaya what are his
[01:18:15] earrings they're like needles the way
[01:18:17] this guy's earrings are to inject you
[01:18:18] it's incredibly difficult to transfer a
[01:18:21] patient
[01:18:24] be aware of this
[01:18:28] oh
[01:18:29] I can't believe your utter lack of faith
[01:18:31] in me to the point of even questioning
[01:18:34] my general level of knowledge
[01:18:36] how unbefitting well you're the only one
[01:18:40] who's ever made such a request
[01:18:42] I have my ways of keeping her safe
[01:18:44] during the journey in addition I can
[01:18:46] also promise that under my care hapasia
[01:18:49] will receive the most advanced and
[01:18:51] effective treatment I will personally
[01:18:54] supervise her treatment and see to her
[01:18:57] recovery
[01:18:58] would that be agreeable to you dude why
[01:19:01] this guy like he looks like a villain
[01:19:03] like if you're gonna try to convince
[01:19:04] someone or something surely you can
[01:19:06] dress normally why are you wearing a
[01:19:08] [ __ ] robe bro like you look like we
[01:19:10] can tell you're a harbinger
[01:19:13] like you could at least cosplay a normal
[01:19:15] person
[01:19:18] yeah wear t-shirts on pants like
[01:19:21] papasia was born in sumero and remains a
[01:19:24] scholar of the Academia her situation
[01:19:26] has not become dire enough to
[01:19:28] necessitate her transfer to another
[01:19:29] Nation
[01:19:30] [Music]
[01:19:32] transporting her to sneshnaya is risky
[01:19:35] and the potential benefits are unknown
[01:19:37] as the person currently responsible for
[01:19:39] her treatment I cannot ah he just said
[01:19:41] no [ __ ] you you cannot take her
[01:19:44] suggestion is rude and Reckless what if
[01:19:46] thetario just killed them
[01:19:51] I don't know much about the doctor but
[01:19:54] after talking with him I realized that
[01:19:56] just like many other Scholars he
[01:19:58] possesses an aura of arrogance that I've
[01:20:00] come to detest
[01:20:03] it's not so much that he's looking down
[01:20:05] on others but more that he's so
[01:20:07] confident in himself and his abilities
[01:20:09] to a point of near Insanity near
[01:20:11] Insanity Clueless yeah surely he's just
[01:20:14] almost insane someone like him
[01:20:19] I prepared myself for a protracted
[01:20:22] battle of wits and was really surprised
[01:20:24] to see him just give up on the topic
[01:20:27] still his reaction really concerned me
[01:20:41] wait what happened he just oh okay
[01:20:44] that was like that was like the delay
[01:20:46] when it's like they transferred to like
[01:20:48] the dude on the news that's like
[01:20:49] reporting the weather's like and now
[01:20:50] back to the man on the scene of the
[01:20:52] crime and then the guy's just like
[01:20:55] yes thank you
[01:20:57] I see of course your opinion makes
[01:21:00] perfect the third is standing there
[01:21:03] you're still young but already quite
[01:21:06] stubborn I must say you are not like
[01:21:09] what I had expected
[01:21:12] under normal circumstances I wouldn't
[01:21:14] just let you off the hook like this but
[01:21:17] unfortunately I'm in a hurry today what
[01:21:20] with her most noble Majesty that Sarita
[01:21:22] wait isn't she dead is that Senora wait
[01:21:25] never mind I'm trolling all right I'm
[01:21:27] sorry I had a rip Bozo moment my bad
[01:21:30] sorry I thought I thought it's not the
[01:21:35] thing it's not a figure my bad chat my
[01:21:36] bad
[01:21:38] luckily there is still some time left
[01:21:40] for me to take care of everything before
[01:21:42] I leave the disrespected shut up it's
[01:21:45] just as the Academia said it was just a
[01:21:47] shout out it was a shout out to Senora
[01:21:49] scholar sadly even with all of that
[01:21:53] you're still lacking a bit of shrewdness
[01:22:01] and that's also why people like you can
[01:22:03] never realize that sooner or later
[01:22:05] everyone must pay the price for what
[01:22:08] they've learned bam
[01:22:10] what the [ __ ]
[01:22:12] what are you trying to say
[01:22:15] this guy just walking away
[01:22:18] nip in the bud
[01:22:20] let's nip that in the bud charge
[01:22:23] [Music]
[01:22:24] I don't can't help but feel like he's
[01:22:26] hinting at something unpleasant he's so
[01:22:28] ugly really I think the story is kind of
[01:22:29] hot but in like a like like not his
[01:22:31] actions obviously but like as a question
[01:22:33] like drip wise I don't care for my
[01:22:37] perhaps I'm nothing but a talking Rock
[01:22:39] in his eyes
[01:22:43] wait chat am I getting 20 nuggies with
[01:22:45] or without fries I don't know if I'm am
[01:22:47] I getting fries too I don't want to be
[01:22:49] dead though they kind of make me dedge
[01:22:53] all right one thing with I
[01:22:56] [Music]
[01:23:01] came off as malicious
[01:23:04] but an utter lack of compassion
[01:23:06] permeated throughout our conversation
[01:23:08] from his tone
[01:23:10] I can sense that he's always looked down
[01:23:12] on others this is so expensive I don't
[01:23:14] know why the McDonald's here so
[01:23:15] expensive it's fine
[01:23:19] all right it'll come in 25 to 30 minutes
[01:23:24] or to 35
[01:23:26] I can barely believe it myself this late
[01:23:28] will be nasty it's a 50 50. one of the
[01:23:30] McDonald's is super good one is super
[01:23:31] bad this one closes in 30 minutes I
[01:23:34] can't remember if this one's good or if
[01:23:35] the next one's good it's a 50 50. so
[01:23:38] we'll we'll see details
[01:23:40] Frankly Speaking I don't want you to do
[01:23:42] anything too risky
[01:23:44] now that you know a little more it
[01:23:45] should be easier for you to stay safe
[01:23:51] the closed Center probably won't be good
[01:23:52] [ __ ] I already put the order through
[01:23:54] tell you everything whatever we approach
[01:23:58] to get your kindness
[01:24:00] it's okay
[01:24:03] I have an obligation to do so
[01:24:06] perfect bro some guy ordered 20 nuggies
[01:24:09] during the last 30 minutes dude
[01:24:11] can I can't I can't count
[01:24:14] all right okay if they're terrible uh
[01:24:17] we'll suffer together like just it's
[01:24:19] fine someone will it's fine
[01:24:23] recently my master wrote several letters
[01:24:25] to me
[01:24:26] asking me to return to the academy
[01:24:29] I didn't know it was closing it didn't
[01:24:31] say closing soon until I ordered then it
[01:24:33] said it
[01:24:35] hasn't he already asked you several
[01:24:36] times before
[01:24:41] yes but Gage I'm off about this most
[01:24:45] recent batch of letters
[01:24:47] handwriting and tone are both familiar
[01:24:49] the Tory wrote them the master will
[01:24:50] occasionally leave a few dots on the
[01:24:52] back of the letter
[01:24:54] one dot means that he wrote the letter
[01:24:55] on a sunny day and three dots stand for
[01:24:58] a rainy day what about two dots this has
[01:25:01] been a habit of his for many years
[01:25:04] find any dots in his recent letters oh
[01:25:07] I believe
[01:25:10] something may have happened to him oh
[01:25:14] I get it
[01:25:16] since you are always at gandarvaville
[01:25:18] the Tory moment someone already working
[01:25:20] but I have to pee so bad I just don't
[01:25:22] feel like getting off I'd like to ask
[01:25:23] you to do that for me if you can keep
[01:25:26] yourself safe
[01:25:27] please withdraw immediately at the first
[01:25:29] hint of danger all right now kiss I can
[01:25:32] do that
[01:25:33] but I have a feeling it won't be that
[01:25:35] simple the Academia has been working on
[01:25:37] a big project
[01:25:38] I'm not quite sure what it is
[01:25:41] but your master might be involved with
[01:25:43] it if the higher ups really are hiding
[01:25:46] something dude look at how close they
[01:25:47] are there's no room for Jesus there's
[01:25:50] two they're so close they're I'm telling
[01:25:52] you the hoyo does this on purpose they
[01:25:55] do it on purpose
[01:25:58] if the situation becomes critical
[01:26:01] I'll leave the Academia
[01:26:04] there's no room for the dendro arc on
[01:26:06] sorry there's no that's the way who else
[01:26:09] is
[01:26:10] which God do they believe in I don't
[01:26:12] even know their lore who does Sino
[01:26:13] believe in Sino beliefs
[01:26:16] gentian
[01:26:22] nahida okay there you go
[01:26:25] all right we've got a plan
[01:26:27] I'll stay at gundarvaville wait that was
[01:26:29] a dumb question obviously we literally
[01:26:31] just had that cutscene like five minutes
[01:26:32] ago he was like okay okay I'm stupid
[01:26:35] shut up that scenario comes to pass you
[01:26:38] must be extra yeah like literally 20
[01:26:41] minutes ago
[01:26:42] I forgot I forgot from the Academia
[01:26:46] I must say I didn't expect a warning
[01:26:48] like this from the general mahamatra
[01:26:50] being loyal to the Academia doesn't mean
[01:26:53] blindly doing whatever the sages say
[01:26:57] like Gandhi
[01:26:59] why is his name Maha Mantra does that
[01:27:01] have a meaning let me Google it Maha
[01:27:04] Matra
[01:27:06] a mahamatra meaning officer of the high
[01:27:09] rank or was an officer of morality
[01:27:12] established by the Indian Emperor Ashoka
[01:27:18] I knew this
[01:27:22] who is called
[01:27:25] what did Maha mantras do
[01:27:27] who the what Britannica I'm on the
[01:27:30] Encyclopedia Britannica
[01:27:35] this isn't even English
[01:27:40] on that note
[01:27:42] aren't you also being quite distrustful
[01:27:45] of your alma mater the Academia yes no
[01:27:48] I'm not saying the word is in English I
[01:27:49] know that I'm saying like the text under
[01:27:51] wasn't English either I was a student I
[01:27:53] was worried he'd get in trouble for
[01:27:54] sticking to his beliefs
[01:27:57] I suppose he's lucky to have lasted so
[01:27:59] long
[01:28:00] look at my lawyer I'm going to jail
[01:28:03] still caught up to him
[01:28:08] not
[01:28:10] I see so you noticed something was up
[01:28:13] with the Academia from the very
[01:28:14] beginning this may well be how Sino
[01:28:16] became involved in all this
[01:28:20] in that case I must keep my promise and
[01:28:23] help you however I can
[01:28:26] also if you run into Sino again please
[01:28:28] help me pass on a message to him
[01:28:31] trust your own senses and experiences
[01:28:33] huh
[01:28:35] I think this may be something he needs
[01:28:37] to hear right now
[01:28:41] okay we'll find it thanks right now
[01:28:44] let's go hunt down this Harbinger oh by
[01:28:46] the way which way did the doctor go when
[01:28:48] he left parties di wait does okay maybe
[01:28:52] dumb question does does since let me
[01:28:54] know that the dottori is a Harbinger
[01:28:56] because I assume so right
[01:29:00] yes
[01:29:02] okay
[01:29:03] that way
[01:29:05] gotcha thanks so much sure
[01:29:10] you know Harbinger is not a secret
[01:29:17] oh he did whatever shut up
[01:29:22] yeah now what now I'm playing snake game
[01:29:24] because because you misbehaved
[01:29:29] it's on purpose I could okay being a
[01:29:31] grapes throws it off it's actually weird
[01:29:33] why the [ __ ] is it a grape uh let's do
[01:29:36] um
[01:29:38] wait yeah this is a pretty good color
[01:29:39] actually but we need to change the board
[01:29:41] I want it to be like a different board
[01:29:42] night time
[01:29:43] pog
[01:29:46] he also said that he'll take care of
[01:29:48] everything before he leaves
[01:29:50] what did he mean by that we need to be
[01:29:53] extra careful when dealing with a person
[01:29:54] like him
[01:29:56] true just to be safe
[01:29:59] we'll do it the mercenary way I'll find
[01:30:02] leads as we go all you have to do is
[01:30:04] just follow me
[01:30:08] because that Harbinger may have tried to
[01:30:10] cover his Trail but he still loves stand
[01:30:12] up Chad what color were daya's eyes or
[01:30:15] perhaps he never even exactly yeah

[01:30:22] black we're headed in the right
[01:30:23] direction

[01:38:44] he has the most punchable face for some
[01:38:47] time already

[01:39:13] for herbs
[01:39:15] herbs do respect your baseless

[01:39:19] unnecessary trouble

[01:41:16] so you think this is over okay I really
[01:41:19] have to pee I'm gonna pause it here
[01:41:21] because I feel like this is an important
[01:41:22] cutscene and I don't want to think about
[01:41:23] how much I have to pee the entire time
[01:41:25] let me go pee then we'll watch the
[01:41:27] cutscene guys I've had to pee for the
[01:41:28] past half an hour I'm not trying to piss
[01:41:30] myself mid cutscene let me just BRB it
[01:41:33] won't be long
[01:41:44] foreign
[01:42:38] [Music]
[01:43:09] yeah
[01:43:09] okay I I feel revitalized I'm truly a
[01:43:13] new man
[01:43:14] sorry I I had to I had to I did
[01:43:16] especially if this is gonna be an
[01:43:18] important cutscene I had to dip
[01:43:20] if you yeah
[01:43:22] splash screen for 3.1 you could CD high
[01:43:26] in the far background using a claymore
[01:43:28] in the same style of nilu and sinus
[01:43:31] which would actually fit
[01:43:34] remain in as you man five weapons match
[01:43:37] just thought I'd imagine
[01:43:42] why is chilling
[01:43:48] needing to go to the bathroom
[01:43:54] all right let's go
[01:44:02] the balladeer
[01:44:11] I've missed that look of abject horror
[01:44:13] you've given me that look every time we
[01:44:16] meet
[01:44:18] bro why are you afraid we literally dude
[01:44:21] do you know who you are lumine
[01:44:33] is it because I made physical contact
[01:44:34] with hypedia that is the balladeer in
[01:44:36] her Consciousness I can hear all of your
[01:44:38] thoughts you know
[01:44:40] [Music]
[01:44:41] don't you remember
[01:44:43] I already saw you the first time you
[01:44:45] came to party's Di and made contact
[01:44:48] Fantasia
[01:44:49] I didn't need to do anything it is her
[01:44:52] honor to be able to connect her
[01:44:54] Consciousness with me
[01:44:57] uh who are you talking to it can't be
[01:45:01] the balladeer right
[01:45:02] that's impossible I know you must be
[01:45:06] curious
[01:45:07] I might as well tell you that I decided
[01:45:09] to enter hapagious Consciousness the
[01:45:11] moment I sensed your touch
[01:45:15] I wanted to observe you on a Fool's
[01:45:17] errand
[01:45:21] I'm on please stay quiet true my
[01:45:25] deification is nearly complete all
[01:45:28] that's left now are just some final
[01:45:29] details
[01:45:31] do you understand
[01:45:32] even if you manage to rescue lesser Lord
[01:45:35] kusan okay cope it will be impossible
[01:45:37] for you to defeat a bona fide God like
[01:45:40] me surely wise to force that childlike
[01:45:44] God into a Divine battle against Scarlet
[01:45:47] with all the respect who already fought
[01:45:48] your mother and won
[01:45:52] others consider the god of wisdom to be
[01:45:54] the sum total of their faith
[01:45:56] it's how they can justify reverence for
[01:45:58] God as they construct it
[01:46:00] but this also shows that Humanity's
[01:46:02] worship of gods technically that makes
[01:46:05] me your father bow down scar up sorry
[01:46:08] it's true laughable
[01:46:12] yes
[01:46:13] what is it
[01:46:17] you're acting more friendly than usual
[01:46:18] or am I mistaken I'm in a good mood
[01:46:21] which is why I'm talking to you like
[01:46:23] this oh cool you want to hang out we
[01:46:25] could be friends you don't chill
[01:46:27] but are you really okay with this
[01:46:30] the Academia plans to infuse your
[01:46:32] Consciousness with Divine knowledge
[01:46:34] capsules this is extremely risky
[01:46:37] even if the academist theories are
[01:46:39] correct and you manage to gain the
[01:46:40] wisdom of a God you would probably no
[01:46:42] longer remain yourself true
[01:46:47] even means losing yourself would you
[01:46:48] still want to become a god
[01:46:51] those words almost make you sound like a
[01:46:54] friend who actually cares he's actually
[01:46:56] dead okay
[01:46:57] I'm telling you this guy I'm telling you
[01:47:00] he just wants a friend he just wants to
[01:47:02] be loved like the Tories actually evil
[01:47:04] scarra's just like he just dude he just
[01:47:07] needs therapy he literally just wants a
[01:47:08] friend
[01:47:09] he literally just needs a hug that's it
[01:47:13] no one is our humans are not friends
[01:47:17] existence is pain watched but you're
[01:47:19] wrong
[01:47:20] I'm different from all of you
[01:47:22] see I was born to become a god
[01:47:25] my entire life up until this point has
[01:47:28] just been a meaningless routine
[01:47:31] just think about a sheet of paper
[01:47:34] by itself it holds no meaning
[01:47:37] the contents recorded on it is what
[01:47:40] gives it value yeah it's like a water
[01:47:42] bottle guys is a water bottle heavy no
[01:47:44] is a gallon of water heavy yes but why
[01:47:47] it's because water is heavy you might
[01:47:49] think water's not heavy I can grab water
[01:47:51] but water is heavy that's why a gallon
[01:47:53] of water is a gallon it's not the
[01:47:54] plastic it's not that that makes it
[01:47:55] heavy it's the water true
[01:47:59] while I had recorded down before were
[01:48:01] some painful memories and boring human
[01:48:04] feelings
[01:48:05] such senseless drivel should have been
[01:48:08] arrested
[01:48:09] he's so emo
[01:48:12] indeed to me the sight of you fools in
[01:48:15] your feudal struggles is far more
[01:48:18] amusing
[01:48:19] tell me
[01:48:20] just what has this world done for you to
[01:48:23] protect it with such zest and conviction
[01:48:25] you wouldn't get it I'm connected to
[01:48:28] your consciousness
[01:48:29] so I can hear what you're thinking and
[01:48:32] sense the depth of your determination
[01:48:36] this is a good conversation we're having
[01:48:38] so here's a word of advice
[01:48:41] let go of your misguided Guardian
[01:48:43] complex you know nothing about no way
[01:48:46] this this guy's talking about having a
[01:48:48] complex no way star is talking about us
[01:48:50] having a complex
[01:48:52] it'll be for your own good
[01:48:54] as well as everything else
[01:48:57] students are a species that can only
[01:48:59] find Bliss in ignorance
[01:49:03] that's truly what you believe why did
[01:49:05] you keep your connection with hype Asia
[01:49:06] surely with the power you've come to
[01:49:09] possess you can cut her off with just a
[01:49:11] thought
[01:49:12] you've seen my affection for her
[01:49:14] if you're in my position I think you'd
[01:49:17] feel the same way she peered into my
[01:49:19] consciousness
[01:49:20] and saw my past
[01:49:22] someone like that is qualified to become
[01:49:25] qualified to become my first follower
[01:49:29] I wish I was herpesa no you don't no you
[01:49:32] don't she's literally dead
[01:49:35] no you don't
[01:49:39] all gods need followers
[01:49:42] so hapasia has been chosen
[01:49:44] her appearance Heralds my imminent
[01:49:47] arrival at the Throne of divinity while
[01:49:50] her worship shall become my glory
[01:49:55] is that so me again
[01:49:57] no matter soon you'll know what kind of
[01:50:01] authority you're challenging
[01:50:07] you truly charge your follower you
[01:50:09] should protect her from harm true who
[01:50:11] wants to hurt my devout follower
[01:50:15] oh
[01:50:17] oh
[01:50:19] it seems that the Tori does not wait for
[01:50:21] to stay in sumeru and continue receiving
[01:50:23] treatment here isn't that a little sauce
[01:50:25] the doctor wants to hurt my first
[01:50:27] follower
[01:50:30] doesn't that make you mad
[01:50:34] how very amusing has anyone ever told
[01:50:37] you that you're not good at sewing
[01:50:38] Discord
[01:50:40] Discord
[01:50:41] wait is there a Discord in tevat do you
[01:50:43] think they call each other like what if
[01:50:44] the Akasha terminals are kind of just
[01:50:46] like a Discord I've never known his
[01:50:49] now the puny human thinks I'm
[01:50:51] self-capable of interfering in the
[01:50:54] business of the new God
[01:50:57] wait this guy doesn't like the Torre uh
[01:50:59] oh we're about to see some inner beef
[01:51:02] you're still too naive if you think a
[01:51:04] few words will be enough to convince me
[01:51:06] to destroy the doctor you'd imagine
[01:51:09] Scaramouche unleashes his Mecca to fight
[01:51:13] the Tori then gero gigachad comes walks
[01:51:16] in the room literally just breathes and
[01:51:19] then he dies
[01:51:20] and then the Piero defeated them
[01:51:23] dude I can't wait till we see Piero
[01:51:26] anyways I thought naive if you think a
[01:51:29] few words will be enough to convince me
[01:51:31] to destroy the doctor but I'm willing to
[01:51:33] give you a gift just like my expression
[01:51:35] of affection towards haipasia it is an
[01:51:37] honor for you to be able to stand here
[01:51:39] and speak with me
[01:51:41] as my listener you will be rewarded
[01:51:47] okay what are you planning

[01:55:47] first
[01:55:48] I understand my condition
[01:55:52] the wound is not fatal
[01:55:54] the more you understand medicine the
[01:55:57] worse of a patient you become I know
[01:55:59] they always think they can push through
[01:56:01] the pain
[01:56:04] down let me rest for a bit
[01:56:09] sorry travel now you may start
[01:56:13] recently uh uh every count yeah

[01:56:21] Academia that sounds uh they ambitious I
[01:56:25] guess anyway this is all Way Beyond me
[01:56:28] as long as I can enjoy every day with a
[01:56:31] drink in my hand food in my stomach and
[01:56:34] a good night's rest that's enough I'll
[01:56:36] only work when I have to
[01:56:39] I must be the least ambitious person
[01:56:42] who's ever set foot in parties T.I don't
[01:56:44] say
[01:56:47] I haven't even thanked you for your help
[01:56:48] back there don't mention it
[01:56:51] well if nothing else all this proves
[01:56:54] that the doctor really did have some
[01:56:55] urgent matter to attend to and left
[01:56:57] sumeru in a hurry
[01:56:59] and I have a theory a game theory thanks
[01:57:03] for what I think the ballet is the
[01:57:04] reason why the doctor is type targeting
[01:57:06] hypasia her Consciousness connects to
[01:57:07] the balladeer and she has seen the Pat
[01:57:09] has passed maybe the fatoui want to
[01:57:11] cover up some secret of the ballet deer
[01:57:14] is that why they tried to seize hepatia
[01:57:16] you said the balladeer claimed that
[01:57:19] hapatia has seen his past have you
[01:57:22] noticed the balladeer is not happy with
[01:57:24] the doctor's actions he thinks the
[01:57:26] doctor has no right to consider himself
[01:57:28] as his equal so if the doctor was to
[01:57:31] show up again with the ballet deer zap
[01:57:34] him with lightning based on what The
[01:57:36] Travelers said I think he would having
[01:57:38] the doctor gone benefits him as well as
[01:57:40] us damn so we team up mascara killed the
[01:57:43] Tory then kill Scara get [ __ ] rip Bozo

[02:00:18] to the Akasha terminal 155 props
[02:00:21] required are also ready I'll go next The
[02:00:24] Traveler and I went to party CI the
[02:00:27] situation was a bit complicated but we
[02:00:30] found tinari unfortunately he was
[02:00:33] wounded during a fight
[02:00:34] who is behind it
[02:00:36] uh well that's the tough part what
[02:00:40] should I say traveler the fatoui or the
[02:00:43] balladeer
[02:00:43] [Music]
[02:00:45] um
[02:00:46] after some back and forth we confirmed
[02:00:48] that the doctor has left sumeru by boat
[02:00:50] he has something urgent to attend to
[02:00:52] back in sneshnaya so we've successfully
[02:00:55] removed the doctors
[02:00:57] pissed because someone hurts [ __ ]
[02:00:59] somebody he's gonna [ __ ] unleash his
[02:01:01] Elemental burst
[02:01:03] Sino vizcara who wins
[02:01:06] who wins a literal God made by the made
[02:01:09] by the fatoui
[02:01:10] or whatever the [ __ ] that's it sages all
[02:01:13] right or an angry boyfriend everything
[02:01:15] also went smoothly on my side
[02:01:17] the aromite should have arrived at their
[02:01:19] destination by now
[02:01:21] to avoid alerting the Quarry Arrow since
[02:01:23] the two months it will stay there for
[02:01:24] now I can't believe you actually got so
[02:01:27] many aeromites in this tumero city it's
[02:01:30] all thanks to Ramon and his Brave team
[02:01:32] as well as their bold strategy

[02:01:46] you mean that's it
[02:01:48] well what else is there to discuss

[02:01:53] encouragement

[02:01:58] get some rest

[02:02:05] are his words verbatim he said go cuddle
[02:02:07] Candace I will maybe I will huh then I
[02:02:10] must reiterate that I'm here to
[02:02:11] strategize and not to lead
[02:02:14] so you should find someone more suitable
[02:02:15] to do that but I thought all of you
[02:02:17] Academia big shots were great these
[02:02:19] Prime not available I should remind you
[02:02:21] that I'm the Scribe

[02:02:34] talker either I guess that leaves it to

[02:06:57] Chad I already did nilu's Quest hello

[02:07:08] [Music]
[02:07:12] offstream
[02:07:15] naturally I slept just fine after all is
[02:07:20] really good he loses kind of just people
[02:07:21] talk energy is an important resource
[02:07:24] you just want to show up how calm you
[02:07:27] are it's crucial to dissipate any
[02:07:29] tension before we execute our plan the
[02:07:32] only thing you're doing is being
[02:07:34] how dare you anyway do you need me to go
[02:07:37] over the game plan again
[02:07:39] foreign
[02:07:41] Target is Grand Sage Azar's office
[02:07:43] everyone in the Academia knows that's
[02:07:46] where the grand Sage's console is only
[02:07:48] they can operate it
[02:07:52] many restricted commands and operations
[02:07:54] are executed via that console I'm sure
[02:07:57] that console has a way to free lesser
[02:07:58] Lord kusan Ali
[02:08:02] that isn't something they could have
[02:08:03] accomplished with their scholarly
[02:08:04] talents alone
[02:08:06] in the sanctuary of surestana there's a
[02:08:09] device of Greater Lord Ruka devatas that
[02:08:11] she once used to isolate herself while
[02:08:12] meditating 500 years ago the grand Sage
[02:08:16] at the time modified the device so that
[02:08:18] it can no longer be controlled from the
[02:08:19] inside they're effectively trapping one
[02:08:22] God with the power the power of another
[02:08:25] yeah the music's a little loud and I
[02:08:28] turned dialogue off a bit don't forget
[02:08:30] today is new Garba Hut day arguably the
[02:08:33] most important date of the Academia the
[02:08:35] sages and core Academia Personnel are
[02:08:37] busy loading the latest batch of
[02:08:39] research developments and legalization
[02:08:40] to knowledge capsules so that they can
[02:08:42] be entered into the Akasha all the
[02:08:45] darshan's researchers have their noses
[02:08:47] to the grindstone and the academius
[02:08:49] grounds are flowing with all sorts of
[02:08:51] people
[02:08:51] it's the perfect time for an Infinity
[02:08:54] leaves his office to supervise the
[02:08:57] entering process that's our cue to
[02:08:59] access the console and free the danger
[02:09:01] Arc well yes that's just the visible
[02:09:03] side of our plan after all
[02:09:07] precedence holds the Academia should
[02:09:09] have already started preparing for
[02:09:11] nagarbaha day
[02:09:19] let's go
[02:09:21] so are we just gonna walk in through the
[02:09:23] front door yes

[02:12:11] surely surely okay we got two
[02:12:22] wait is it not the high TP I thought it
[02:12:24] was odd is it really oh it's probably
[02:12:25] just not when you run on the bridge oh
[02:12:27] my God wait I think they're approaching
[02:12:30] with my order
[02:12:34] order complete okay let me go get my
[02:12:36] food
[02:12:38] should I start the cutscene when I'm not
[02:12:40] here or did I just go get the food

[02:14:08] wasn't bad but it actually taste like
[02:14:10] cardboard

[02:14:15] oh it's actually not even that bad it's
[02:14:17] fine
[02:14:18] okay wait
[02:14:19] I'm not trying to touch my keyboard if
[02:14:21] I'm eating though so I need this to auto
[02:14:22] play so if there's like a
[02:14:27] I don't know whatever surely it's gonna
[02:14:29] be a cutscene
[02:14:36] surely this is a cutscene and I don't
[02:14:38] have to fight right
[02:14:42] dude I'm not eating nuggies with a fork
[02:14:44] get chopsticks for nuggets
[02:14:47] you eat chicken nuggets with chopsticks
[02:14:54] wait I can't unbox this
[02:14:57] yeah so actually is that a thing
[02:15:11] well I actually don't have room for
[02:15:13] everything
[02:15:16] so you can touch your PC that's actually
[02:15:18] kind of five head
[02:15:24] actually low-key kind of Hot Head okay
[02:15:25] chat we're going in for it we're testing
[02:15:27] nugget
[02:15:30] barbecue nugget
[02:15:33] oh [ __ ] okay there's still that's me
[02:15:36] something that matters what about orange
[02:15:38] before it closed dude we lost the 50 50.
[02:15:42] nice to see you here
[02:15:43] I had heard that the sages were looking
[02:15:45] for you [ __ ] dude but I did whatever
[02:15:47] what for
[02:15:49] oh and
[02:15:50] um also
[02:15:52] please don't bring outside guests into
[02:15:54] the Academia
[02:15:58] well I don't know you look like that
[02:15:59] wait are they not supposed to look like
[02:16:01] that it's such a conclusion
[02:16:02] yeah
[02:16:03] I don't know
[02:16:09] what did you say
[02:16:11] I'm the top student and I are in third
[02:16:14] place at the last introduction debate
[02:16:16] they're so paleo down on me
[02:16:18] that wasn't my intention as your
[02:16:21] haravitot senior I just assumed that you
[02:16:23] possessed a greater aptitude for
[02:16:25] critical thinking
[02:16:26] look
[02:16:27] based on what you already know the
[02:16:30] purpose of my return and the reason
[02:16:31] they're here should be obvious
[02:16:35] is that so
[02:16:38] they're so stale holy [ __ ] let me think
[02:16:41] don't tell me the answer
[02:16:43] the sages search for you
[02:16:46] a blonde hair Traveler
[02:16:48] outside guests
[02:16:51] so from the start
[02:16:54] the sages sport looking for you but this
[02:16:58] Traveler
[02:16:59] and you were gone from the Academia for
[02:17:01] so long because
[02:17:04] yes you've proven yourself as the top
[02:17:07] student in haravat I surmise you've
[02:17:09] arrived at the correct conclusion
[02:17:14] forgive me
[02:17:15] just now thank you for getting me back
[02:17:18] on track
[02:17:21] it's nothing we'll be on our way then
[02:17:24] all right
[02:17:26] your contributions to the
[02:17:28] crib
[02:17:33] surely this cutscene isn't two seconds
[02:17:34] and I'm actually able to eat I don't
[02:17:36] have to fight
[02:17:43] I'm afraid I don't know either
[02:17:49] he convinced himself of whatever truth
[02:17:51] he came up with
[02:17:52] that is the so-called pride of a scholar
[02:17:55] if someone questions their academic
[02:17:57] facility they will instantly feign
[02:17:59] understanding to keep up appearances
[02:18:02] nowadays the Academia is rampant with
[02:18:05] this type of scholar there are obvious
[02:18:07] farces of intellect only serve to
[02:18:09] highlight themselves as fools
[02:18:15] we shouldn't waste any more time it
[02:18:17] would be problematic oh we missed our
[02:18:19] opportunity when I have to go
[02:18:22] it's fun I'm able to move I'm just not
[02:18:25] able to function
[02:18:31] I can't switch characters I can't how do
[02:18:34] I
[02:18:35] here we're good
[02:18:39] should I use chopsticks okay if I
[02:18:41] actually have to fight I'll get
[02:18:41] Chopsticks or like a fork
[02:18:44] is this the academia's library
[02:18:50] indeed known as the house of Dana it is
[02:18:53] quite possibly the most extensive
[02:18:54] specialist
[02:18:59] okay just to waltz right in
[02:19:02] the Academia marches to a fast beat
[02:19:04] especially since it's nagarbaha day
[02:19:06] they're all occupied with their own
[02:19:08] matters just act natural
[02:19:11] now hurry along
[02:19:13] [Music]
[02:19:16] bro
[02:19:19] [Music]
[02:19:22] it's fine
[02:19:26] okay we're good
[02:19:30] dude these nuggies are not shaped
[02:19:32] correctly
[02:19:35] it's a lift that Academia Personnel use
[02:19:38] to access higher floors
[02:19:45] [Music]
[02:19:46] no not right now we can't guarantee that
[02:19:50] we won't run into the Great Sage let's
[02:19:52] step back
[02:19:55] [Laughter]
[02:20:00] I think the grand Sage will exit from
[02:20:03] there
[02:20:06] and after he does we'd sneak past him
[02:20:09] they're not even warm anymore they're
[02:20:11] like actually cold who knows
[02:20:13] however if we can confirm Azar's current
[02:20:16] location our operation will be much
[02:20:18] safer if we allow me to offer you a hint
[02:20:21] if you wish to know his location
[02:20:34] here
[02:20:42] do not tell me you believed the Academia
[02:20:44] would not grow suspicious of you after
[02:20:46] such a prolonged absence subscribe
[02:20:50] and I witness had informed me of your
[02:20:53] whereabouts so I came to personally
[02:20:55] welcome you
[02:20:57] can you just come on I didn't expect you
[02:21:00] to care so much about me I'm truly
[02:21:02] flattered
[02:21:04] I'm sure but compared to you I am far
[02:21:07] more interested in these two unexpected
[02:21:10] guests you are the traveler no I wasn't
[02:21:14] being pissed
[02:21:16] it's a Pity that only now have I been
[02:21:18] afforded the opportunity to formally
[02:21:20] meet two of sumeru's most esteemed
[02:21:22] guests I do apologize for my lack of
[02:21:26] decorum
[02:21:31] excellent you immediately initiated
[02:21:33] discussion instead of attempting to
[02:21:35] prepare some perfunctory excuse
[02:21:38] you clearly understand the situation
[02:21:41] true because of Daniels are true actual
[02:21:42] attention of making a record I forgot
[02:21:44] about that
[02:21:45] the foot traffic here renders this place
[02:21:47] unsuitable for discussion please follow
[02:21:50] me to my office
[02:22:01] never mind
[02:22:03] this place is crawling with guards
[02:22:06] there's no way dude this is the most
[02:22:08] stale it's like there's like why can it
[02:22:10] bounce it's like I'm not feeling your
[02:22:12] chicken I'm feeling the stale like we
[02:22:13] should discuss with me friedness today
[02:22:15] is whatever so I still have many
[02:22:18] responsibilities to attend to there is
[02:22:21] little time for idle chit chat before I
[02:22:23] detain you all
[02:22:26] hmm you see if that is so then you
[02:22:29] should be praising our great work rather
[02:22:32] than using your trivial misgivings in a
[02:22:34] futile attempt to sway me
[02:22:40] then tell me what do the fatoui want
[02:22:43] from me
[02:22:45] worthless
[02:22:47] those are all completely worthless
[02:22:50] benefits divine power these
[02:22:54] materialistic words do nothing but
[02:22:55] debase our great work creating a God yes
[02:23:00] we are using human wisdom to create a
[02:23:04] god
[02:23:05] if Humanity cannot attain omniscience
[02:23:07] and omnipotence then we shall create a
[02:23:10] God to reveal them this is the Pinnacle
[02:23:13] of human wisdom
[02:23:17] we shall regain a God's guidance at long
[02:23:20] last no longer when we flounder in the
[02:23:23] end of Consciousness and knowledge even
[02:23:26] ermann's soul will be freed from its
[02:23:29] plight
[02:23:30] foreign
[02:23:32] this is the ultimate aspiration they
[02:23:36] wanted to make a new God since the
[02:23:37] hero's like a baby and couldn't make
[02:23:39] sense but it took them so long that he
[02:23:41] does now like she's still a child but at
[02:23:43] least she's like useful so surely by now
[02:23:46] it's more worth to just [ __ ] follow
[02:23:48] nahida you idiot
[02:23:50] whatever
[02:23:52] you will never understand the Rapture of
[02:23:55] having a God be born within your very
[02:23:57] hands with your degree of knowledge you
[02:24:01] cannot even comprehend such an emotion
[02:24:04] gods exist on a plane that far eclipses
[02:24:07] Humanity what can't you even do
[02:24:10] what can she even do
[02:24:14] Hey What Can you what can your [ __ ]
[02:24:16] Mecca robot friend within a God complex
[02:24:18] dude
[02:24:19] fabricate silly fairy tales these are
[02:24:23] but child's play for the Academia does
[02:24:26] that make us equal to the Gods
[02:24:30] we are a people favored by greater Lord
[02:24:33] Ruka devata though I may have personally
[02:24:36] not seen it our forefathers bore witness
[02:24:39] to True wisdom the Ascension of the
[02:24:42] letter Lord has brought nothing but
[02:24:43] bewilderment to the scholars they all
[02:24:46] ask is that truly what true wisdom is
[02:24:49] supposed to look like
[02:24:51] with that in mind it is better to keep
[02:24:54] her isolated in the sanctuary of
[02:24:56] surestana so our Academy will not become
[02:24:59] embroiled in turmoil
[02:25:04] think that only the super smart or
[02:25:07] powerful should be able to call
[02:25:08] themselves gods
[02:25:12] don't said this guy hasn't seen nilu
[02:25:14] nahida Bloom team I can't
[02:25:16] true as per your judgment Grand Sage
[02:25:19] they are indeed dangerous individuals
[02:25:22] not only are they acting against the
[02:25:25] Academia I just finished my Barbie sauce
[02:25:27] trap to open a Sweden sour one now
[02:25:28] straight do I alternate The Forbidden
[02:25:30] combo in my assignments I hate them are
[02:25:34] you talking about us
[02:25:37] anyway I've brought them to the airport
[02:25:40] but it took some time and trouble
[02:25:45] pay attention I'm sorry I was listening
[02:25:48] that reminds me
[02:25:49] here's the investigation report you had
[02:25:51] requested it's a summary of my time
[02:25:54] spent with the traveler an array of
[02:25:56] information about her ready for your
[02:25:57] perusal
[02:26:00] wait what the [ __ ] I hate them
[02:26:06] [Music]
[02:26:15] no it has to be cop
[02:26:23] y cop
[02:26:27] [Music]
[02:26:32] excellent
[02:26:34] contents with no errors I would expect
[02:26:37] nothing less than an Immaculate report
[02:26:39] from The Scribe
[02:26:40] [Music]
[02:26:43] as it is near Garba Hut day I'll enter
[02:26:45] the information on you into the Akasha
[02:26:48] surely you know what that means
[02:26:51] we'll be monitored just like Sino with
[02:26:54] the akasha's calculation prowess all of
[02:26:57] your actions will be predicted with an
[02:26:59] accuracy of at least 98 I'll hide them
[02:27:02] is never wrong it's my fault it will be
[02:27:04] updated in real time whenever new
[02:27:06] information presents itself
[02:27:08] to put it into words you can understand
[02:27:10] wherever you go you will be walking
[02:27:13] under an invisible leash
[02:27:15] sumero's greatest penalty for dishonest
[02:27:18] persons
[02:27:20] are you not familiar with the concept
[02:27:22] that great responsibility begets an
[02:27:24] equally great suspicion
[02:27:27] in any case you are sumeru's most
[02:27:29] concerning external variable locking you
[02:27:32] down will greatly decrease the chance of
[02:27:34] any undesirable outcomes coming to pass
[02:27:37] okay but surely if they've been studying
[02:27:39] us
[02:27:40] surely they know we can not only kill
[02:27:43] all of them but also kill I'll hide them
[02:27:44] if we have to so why is he like perhaps
[02:27:47] from your perspective but why is it cool
[02:27:49] I suppose you would mentally prepared
[02:27:51] yourselves for this no
[02:27:56] your Ploy was to sacrifice The Traveler
[02:28:00] here was it not
[02:28:03] [Music]
[02:28:05] Lord Azar I know what you're trying to
[02:28:08] say but I've been following your plan
[02:28:10] this entire time why are you doubting me
[02:28:12] at this juncture
[02:28:14] because he's a double agent he fell in
[02:28:16] love with us true and then we marry
[02:28:18] al-haita exactly
[02:28:26] first off I received an eyewitness
[02:28:29] report that you were spotted with the
[02:28:31] traveler to Caravan ribot however you
[02:28:34] immediately departed for the desert and
[02:28:36] escaped surveillance range
[02:28:38] judging by the time you all likely
[02:28:41] encountered the truant General mahamatra
[02:28:43] in the desert am I correct
[02:28:49] maybe Batman shouldn't have mentioned
[02:28:51] Sino just now the Academia had not
[02:28:54] received correspondence from its scribe
[02:28:56] for a prolonged time you were also in
[02:28:59] the company of the traveler a close
[02:29:01] associate of lesser Lord kusanali and
[02:29:04] general mahamatra Sino who had defected
[02:29:07] from the Academia
[02:29:09] with their instigation what was the
[02:29:11] probability that you would betray the
[02:29:13] Academia rationally speaking 50 70 this
[02:29:18] guy so nerd what do you think
[02:29:21] regardless that's only a guess the facts
[02:29:25] are that I've brought the traveler right
[02:29:27] before you and I gave you my report
[02:29:30] indeed your boldness deserves praise to
[02:29:34] think that despite status as an
[02:29:36] Outlander The Traveler is still willing
[02:29:39] to sacrifice for the sake of your plan
[02:29:42] if I'm correct you have a contingency
[02:29:45] plan to save lesser Lord kusanali and
[02:29:48] ruin our great work
[02:29:53] against the Academia are near garbahade
[02:29:56] using al-hatham's status as the Scribe
[02:29:58] for there is a good chance that an
[02:30:00] opportunity to save the Lesser Lord will
[02:30:03] arise
[02:30:04] should your intentions be discovered all
[02:30:07] Heather will turn traitor and sacrifice
[02:30:09] The Traveler thus proving his innocence
[02:30:12] he can then stay inside the Academia and
[02:30:16] continue searching for a way to proceed
[02:30:18] forward
[02:30:19] as for Sino according to the akasha's
[02:30:22] calculations he will soon return to the
[02:30:25] he knows and confront me in person his
[02:30:27] dream's not being bro there's no other
[02:30:28] way it's also a part of you this guy's
[02:30:30] in the Trap say hi to Azar
[02:30:35] he is a traitor regardless of what I say
[02:30:38] no
[02:30:40] even if you impugn me it would have
[02:30:42] little effect on you all
[02:30:45] you misunderstand losing our scribe
[02:30:48] would irreparably damage the academia's
[02:30:50] regular operations and the development
[02:30:52] of sumeru's future academic systems
[02:30:56] Roger said 20 nuggies and I'm still
[02:30:58] hungry and circumstances that's not
[02:31:00] possible even that is Trivial compared
[02:31:02] to what we stand to gain from how great
[02:31:04] work
[02:31:05] you said that I betrayed the Academia
[02:31:07] but you was are you've betrayed all of
[02:31:10] sumeru betrayed its archon
[02:31:14] oh
[02:31:15] so flight is turned to fight at long
[02:31:18] last
[02:31:18] guards

[02:31:52] well what do we have here so you stole
[02:31:56] that Divine knowledge capsule
[02:31:58] [Music]
[02:32:00] you Trader
[02:32:02] even the most rational scholar will
[02:32:05] yearn for the power of a God in a moment
[02:32:08] of desperation aren't you doing the
[02:32:10] exact same thing as me I'll hate them
[02:32:13] unfortunately for you no God will lend
[02:32:16] you their power
[02:32:18] [Music]
[02:32:30] there's another there's another weapon
[02:32:32] he has gone completely insane bro I had
[02:32:36] them just use a sword
[02:32:38] oh
[02:32:44] take him to the Mantra and Exile him to
[02:32:47] aru Village
[02:32:48] [Music]
[02:32:50] take these two to the confinement room
[02:32:53] I'll deal with them later
[02:32:57] Grand Sage we finished all required
[02:32:59] preparations
[02:33:00] we may begin to enter the capsules now
[02:33:02] excellent
[02:33:05] you may begin
[02:33:08] [Music]
[02:33:17] wait
[02:33:19] surely you dance on them sure this was
[02:33:22] all part of the plan
[02:33:25] wait a second he knew
[02:33:29] wait so
[02:33:32] wait wait so we thought they knew our
[02:33:36] plan but then we thought I'll hide them
[02:33:37] you and then we're like oh they know
[02:33:39] that I hide the nose that we know but
[02:33:40] now we knew that they would know that
[02:33:43] I'll hide the nose that we know so it's
[02:33:45] like a it's like a Yu-Gi-Oh trap card
[02:33:47] true
[02:33:50] [Music]
[02:33:51] we knew it
[02:33:55] hey
[02:33:56] I've got a bit carried away there how is
[02:33:58] payment backing just now great huh
[02:34:08] maybe don't say that out loud you
[02:34:11] idiot I'm sorry
[02:34:24] man again what are we doing next trouble
[02:34:26] remembering things when she's worked up
[02:34:30] right right pyman thinks it went some
[02:34:35] apart from that we still have yet
[02:34:38] another goal in the first stage of our
[02:34:40] operation which is to send the traveler
[02:34:42] to the confinement room
[02:34:50] should I drink a coffee yes
[02:34:54] please be nice if I'm on sorry you might
[02:34:56] have you might have joined the wrong
[02:34:57] stream here she's always been the person
[02:35:00] the sages are most afraid of as well as
[02:35:02] the greatest obstacle to the successful
[02:35:04] implementation of their plan they are
[02:35:06] very aware of the risk she poses to them
[02:35:11] once the traveler is imprisoned the
[02:35:13] sages will likely think that everything
[02:35:15] is under control
[02:35:17] and with their guard down the next phase
[02:35:19] of our plan will have a much higher
[02:35:21] chance of success
[02:35:23] I can already see the pompous looks on
[02:35:26] their faces true
[02:35:34] that isn't the only reason of course she
[02:35:36] has a more important task once she's in
[02:35:38] confinement
[02:35:40] according to the Academia scholars in
[02:35:41] rahman's custody lesser Lord kusanali
[02:35:44] has sealed off her Consciousness in the
[02:35:46] Akasha ever since she was captured by
[02:35:48] the doctor
[02:35:49] that way they can't pry any more
[02:35:51] information from her even if we break
[02:35:53] into the sanctuary of surestana it will
[02:35:55] take time to awaken Lester Lord
[02:35:57] kusanali's Consciousness we need to do
[02:35:59] that in advance
[02:36:01] so our job is a job in a wake up Nikita
[02:36:03] okay totally worth getting thrown and
[02:36:06] jailed for the confinement room is
[02:36:08] inside the Academia close to the
[02:36:10] sanctuary of surestana it's a complete
[02:36:13] nugget sorry I finish them and you won't
[02:36:14] be receiving any visitors I'll work with
[02:36:17] Raman Scholars to make some
[02:36:19] modifications to your Akasha terminal
[02:36:21] once you're in get as close as you can
[02:36:23] to lesser Lord kusanali and try to
[02:36:25] connect to her consciousness
[02:36:27] however
[02:36:29] as for whether she'll actually wake up
[02:36:31] that will depend on our luck
[02:36:36] is still hungry ah 20 nuggets and I'm
[02:36:39] almost done my medium fries
[02:36:43] modified
[02:36:46] I thought they take our Akashi terminals
[02:36:49] when they'd like to step in here
[02:36:52] were they being careless
[02:36:55] that's not a meal yeah I mean yeah
[02:37:01] I also worked out today
[02:37:05] but usually 20 nuggets is like too much
[02:37:13] sucks

[02:49:17] will be here to keep people from going
[02:49:19] to the Academia so they don't interrupt
[02:49:21] your performance
[02:49:23] I was planning on telling them something
[02:49:24] like the Academia has been conducting a
[02:49:27] weird experiment and some of their test
[02:49:29] subjects escaped it's really dangerous
[02:49:31] there so stay away oh you couldn't think
[02:49:35] of anything better oh well I guess it
[02:49:39] does sound like something the Academia
[02:49:40] would do
[02:49:46] it'll be a piece of
[02:49:48] [Music]
[02:49:50] cake
[02:49:51] [Music]
[02:49:57] you guys think we can play the liar
[02:49:59] midquest what do you think
[02:50:03] hey nilu sorry it's great to see you but
[02:50:07] I'm really busy right now our base

[02:50:19] candy though
[02:50:20] I cut back on sleeps in the fury leading
[02:50:22] up to a performance and I'm about to
[02:50:25] start one
[02:50:26] you have a point the stage is cleared
[02:50:29] yeah the night of flowers is a good shot
[02:50:31] I remember your performance at anything
[02:50:32] I remember last act or two act three
[02:50:34] acts ago thanks to you I'm really
[02:50:37] grateful
[02:50:38] all right you're welcome Leon was all
[02:50:41] mine since I'll have such a great view
[02:50:43] of the show
[02:50:44] I'm not gonna lie though I don't really
[02:50:45] care about all these NPCs talking
[02:50:48] I want to go back to the [ __ ]
[02:50:55] main part
[02:51:01] [Music]
[02:51:19] thank you
[02:51:21] [Music]
[02:51:29] I've never seen a performance like this
[02:51:32] this is incredible yeah
[02:51:36] but I heard that public performances
[02:51:38] like these have been banned I can't
[02:51:41] believe she's doing this here
[02:51:44] [Music]
[02:51:47] and Sage there's some commotion outside
[02:51:50] how uninteresting issue the new
[02:51:53] prohibition act from the Akasha to the
[02:51:55] gods they'll know what to do
[02:52:00] uh do you think we should like stop her
[02:52:03] just watch for a little bit longer
[02:52:10] [Music]
[02:52:16] can't nearly just bloom
[02:52:19] [Music]
[02:52:23] [Applause]
[02:52:26] [Music]
[02:52:36] [Applause]
[02:52:45] laughs
[02:52:56] like clapping I was thinking
[02:52:59] huh did you hear that it sounds like a
[02:53:02] lot of guards just ran by does this mean
[02:53:04] the plan has moved on to the next stage
[02:53:08] yep yep everything seems to be going
[02:53:11] well come to think of it when did all
[02:53:13] Haytham replace the knowledge capsule
[02:53:15] that was about to be entered into the
[02:53:16] Akasha
[02:53:17] [Music]
[02:53:19] he did it
[02:53:21] I'm too nervous to notice Giga Chad
[02:53:24] thinking of didn't all hazum also yank
[02:53:27] the Divine knowledge capsule from that
[02:53:29] movie
[02:53:33] ah
[02:53:36] it is
[02:53:38] why are we complimenting him the fact
[02:53:40] that I get when I hit eat McDonald's
[02:53:41] until unproductive is hitting I have to
[02:53:44] resist it don't have any coffee left
[02:53:46] to do right now
[02:53:48] and it'll help us feel that was
[02:53:49] disgusting what did I said that
[02:53:56] [Music]
[02:54:00] now that lesser Lord kusanali's
[02:54:02] Consciousness am I making a third of
[02:54:03] coffee I just had two coffees core
[02:54:04] figures of the Academia and their gourds
[02:54:07] have started to wear the rakasha
[02:54:08] terminals again
[02:54:09] with the doctor's technological support
[02:54:11] they think they have nothing to fear
[02:54:14] how Despicable of them to rely on such a
[02:54:17] person but this is also our chance
[02:54:21] I was originally asked to draft the
[02:54:23] knowledge capsule for the artistic
[02:54:25] performances prohibition act when I was
[02:54:27] still at the Academia it should be on
[02:54:29] the grand Sage's desk right now and will
[02:54:32] be entered into the Akasha during the
[02:54:33] next niagarbaha day
[02:54:36] are they really going to stop all
[02:54:38] artistic performances
[02:54:42] I'll make an identical knowledge capsule
[02:54:44] but this time I'll smuggle some
[02:54:46] misleading information into it
[02:54:49] we only need to find an opportunity to
[02:54:52] switch the capsules
[02:54:53] once it's been entered into the Akasha
[02:54:56] on nagarbahade if someone were to be
[02:54:58] seen performing in public there's
[02:55:01] actually relied on Wheeler definitely
[02:55:02] used that opportunity to announce the
[02:55:04] ban and so the misleading information
[02:55:07] will be disseminated amongst the guards
[02:55:10] sure sounds complicated but it seems
[02:55:13] like if everything goes well we'll be
[02:55:15] able to get rid of all the guards in the
[02:55:16] Academia without any effort that's
[02:55:19] pretty clever getting right into their
[02:55:21] heads I just have one question even if
[02:55:24] we managed to get the misleading info
[02:55:26] out to the guards how can we be sure
[02:55:28] that they'll believe it people who are
[02:55:30] used to relying on the Akasha become
[02:55:32] less inquisitive and their ability to
[02:55:35] distinguish truth from misinformation is
[02:55:37] significantly reduced
[02:55:39] they will view everything the Akasha
[02:55:42] releases to them as the unequivocal
[02:55:43] truth the Akasha will turn humans into
[02:55:47] machines
[02:55:48] I've seen it happen many times
[02:55:50] yikes minus 30k long when I was working
[02:55:54] in sumero City
[02:55:55] at first I thought it was a good thing
[02:55:57] too
[02:56:00] by the way this plan still requires a
[02:56:02] performer right do you have someone in
[02:56:05] mind
[02:56:07] I know her really well
[02:56:09] we can trust her
[02:56:12] until I'm not running an ad this could
[02:56:14] participate in a dangerous plan like
[02:56:16] this but we can ask her in person
[02:56:19] all right
[02:56:20] that's redeeming everything
[02:56:25] then it'll be time for me and my
[02:56:27] stowaway Brothers to shine
[02:56:33] okay that was pretty that was that was
[02:56:36] that was that
[02:56:39] dude the only thing I don't get is when
[02:56:40] everyone saw when all the characters on
[02:56:42] your side are so strong I don't know you
[02:56:44] don't just kill all the guards
[02:56:46] came out from the Academia in droves
[02:56:54] after laying low in the city for so long
[02:56:57] this is the moment we've been waiting
[02:56:59] for
[02:57:00] my brothers have already sprung into
[02:57:02] action
[02:57:03] we couldn't do anything to him inside
[02:57:06] their Coop but outside the Academia this
[02:57:09] is our hunting ground
[02:57:12] lioness like you the prey sure won't be
[02:57:15] able to run far
[02:57:16] [Music]
[02:57:20] we still need to eliminate the guards as
[02:57:23] soon as possible if we give the sages
[02:57:25] enough time to realize what's happening
[02:57:26] the plans don't
[02:57:28] all they've done is to sit on their
[02:57:31] cushy salaries and twin of their thumbs
[02:57:33] all day while we fought and struggled
[02:57:35] every day in the desert the only
[02:57:37] Advantage they might have is their
[02:57:39] numbers
[02:57:40] speaking of which most of the guards who
[02:57:42] report directly to the six sages belong
[02:57:44] to the core 30 but they have a
[02:57:47] completely different reputation
[02:57:49] following those blasted sages every whim
[02:57:51] throwing away all the convenience
[02:57:54] as someone in the same profession I'm
[02:57:57] obligated to teach him a good lesson
[02:57:58] today
[02:57:59] indeed the track has been set all we
[02:58:04] need to do is lead them there
[02:58:06] all right let's each take a road and
[02:58:08] herd those scattered guards back into
[02:58:09] one place make sure to attract their
[02:58:12] attention Isaac will be not Isaac bro
[02:58:15] nobody cares what that little ship such
[02:58:17] an important task to that child
[02:58:20] will he be okay it'll be fine esoc was
[02:58:24] so determined to help so let's put our
[02:58:26] faith in him besides even if he's caught
[02:58:28] guards would be too scared to do
[02:58:30] anything to him they've never seen
[02:58:32] lesser Lord cousin Ali in person after
[02:58:34] all you've got a point
[02:58:36] anyway I think I see them good luck
[02:58:52] this outfit
[02:58:56] can't wait
[02:58:58] this is weird what the [ __ ] are you
[02:59:01] doing bro what are you doing do you
[02:59:03] remember what you need to do isak when
[02:59:06] the guards get here you'll pretend to be
[02:59:07] lesser one kusan Ali and run away from
[02:59:09] them oh yeah I remember of course I do
[02:59:13] I'm just uh this is what you missed this
[02:59:16] one you lose the 50 50 on nahira
[02:59:19] foreign
[02:59:21] at home even if that happens we won't
[02:59:25] leave you behind
[02:59:26] you only need to think about getting the
[02:59:28] guards attention and leaning them to the
[02:59:30] Grand Bazaar leave the rat okay got it
[02:59:33] I'm here to pay back lesser Lord
[02:59:36] kusanali for helping Grandpa my won't
[02:59:39] get cold feet hey they're here I can see
[02:59:43] the Academia cart
[02:59:46] oh
[02:59:47] all right
[02:59:50] you can do this
[02:59:55] wait why is this POV what the [ __ ]
[02:59:58] this is so weird
[03:00:04] this is what it's like when you launch
[03:00:05] Kenshin when you download Kenshin from a
[03:00:07] third party
[03:00:09] this is different from our plan but
[03:00:12] there's no time I need to
[03:00:18] [Music]
[03:00:26] um let's have a look behind the house
[03:00:30] L Choice oh [ __ ] looks like nothing's
[03:00:35] here a wasted time this looks like a
[03:00:37] gentian ad
[03:00:41] what should I do next
[03:00:50] hey stop I saw you it said good
[03:00:53] opportunity how was that a good
[03:00:55] opportunity it said wait for a good
[03:00:56] opportunity I figured that was it would
[03:00:58] wait for
[03:00:59] no hey stop I saw you don't try to run
[03:01:14] doesn't seem like anything unusual is
[03:01:16] around here
[03:01:17] looks like the guard finally left
[03:01:20] it was this POV
[03:01:24] I can't
[03:01:30] it feels like stuff and like an ad for
[03:01:32] like like a fake like a bootleg of the
[03:01:34] game listen Lord kusan Ollie how did I
[03:01:37] not notice that
[03:01:41] bizarre the target suspected to be
[03:01:44] listening JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
[03:01:47] song
[03:01:56] oh it worked
[03:01:58] where did she go how did she disappear
[03:02:01] did we lose her hurry up and find her
[03:02:05] hey
[03:02:06] where's your team here didn't we say to
[03:02:09] split up our search
[03:02:10] hurry hurry this place is why are you
[03:02:14] always yeah
[03:02:16] yeah and at one heck of a coincidence
[03:02:20] new gun
[03:02:24] I suppose that's I told you Robin's Giga
[03:02:27] Chad Redemption Arc
[03:02:31] planning
[03:02:38] little Pratt
[03:02:40] so you're not actually lesson Lord
[03:02:42] kusanali
[03:02:43] who exactly are you all just some
[03:02:46] colleagues think of this as a business
[03:02:49] competition or a personal Grudge after
[03:02:53] stepping into our traps stop thinking of
[03:02:55] yourselves as Hunters behave like that
[03:02:57] okay
[03:03:00] hey there if you need another print
[03:03:02] never mind
[03:03:11] the [ __ ] NPC movement
[03:03:15] how's that possible this is sumero city
[03:03:18] but mercenaries from the desert somehow
[03:03:20] ambushed us
[03:03:22] you've spent all your time hiding away
[03:03:24] in the Academia this place has long
[03:03:26] since become our hunting ground brace
[03:03:29] yourselves
[03:03:32] surely you let us play trial now if I
[03:03:35] can dare surely you goes to trial
[03:03:39] no of course not all right
[03:03:44] this is odd
[03:03:47] the Academia has quieted down after the
[03:03:49] conclusion of the Niagara day ceremonies
[03:03:52] but it's much quieter than usual where
[03:03:55] are the guards
[03:03:57] why have I not seen a single one
[03:03:59] gods
[03:04:01] Grand Sage he's actually clueless he's
[03:04:05] actually Clueless
[03:04:06] why did you come my apologies Grand Sage
[03:04:10] right now all Academia guards have
[03:04:13] entered the city to perform the order to
[03:04:14] rest I thought you knew arrest who is
[03:04:19] there to arrest I have an ominous
[03:04:22] arrest lesser Lord kusan Ali right is
[03:04:25] that not what the order was lesser Lord
[03:04:27] kusanali you mean she has disappeared
[03:04:30] yes I wouldn't dare make up something
[03:04:32] like that right now everyone is in a
[03:04:35] panic and many are saying that
[03:04:37] lesser Lord kusanali will take revenge
[03:04:40] on us what happened
[03:04:42] what is going on that is actually
[03:04:45] clueless somebody somehow escaped
[03:04:47] was it all heatham and his party that
[03:04:49] freed her that's impossible the Academia
[03:04:52] is heavily guarded today and any order
[03:04:54] to release lesser Lord kusanali would be
[03:04:56] strictly confidential
[03:04:58] besides I'll hate them and the traveler
[03:05:00] are already in our hands
[03:05:02] what manner of trickery did they employ
[03:05:05] how could lesser Lord cousin Ali
[03:05:07] disappear Into Thin Air disappear
[03:05:11] wait
[03:05:13] how was the arrest order distributed to
[03:05:15] the guards
[03:05:17] it was issued by the Akasha earlier
[03:05:19] today only you have the authority to
[03:05:21] send messages like that so I thought it
[03:05:24] was your order
[03:05:27] let me check
[03:05:31] why does he walk so slow
[03:05:36] ah
[03:05:37] Lord kusanale has escaped from the
[03:05:40] sanctuary of sarasthana
[03:05:42] go to the city and arrest the escapee
[03:05:45] immediately
[03:05:47] Kasha indeed contains this information
[03:05:50] and it clearly appeared in my mind
[03:05:52] how did they bypass my permissions to
[03:05:54] issue this kind of message was report
[03:05:56] about the traveler that all Haytham
[03:05:58] submitted no
[03:06:00] specifically checked that knowledge
[03:06:02] capsule before entering it into the
[03:06:03] Akasha
[03:06:05] could that have been a red herring
[03:06:08] well even if I figure it out now it
[03:06:11] won't make any difference the important
[03:06:13] thing now is to confirm lesser Lord
[03:06:14] kusanali's status
[03:06:16] have you been to the sanctuary of
[03:06:18] surestana to confirm that lesser Lord
[03:06:20] kusanali is indeed oh I didn't think of
[03:06:22] that confirm no I I haven't no [ __ ] it
[03:06:27] it may be a bit offensive to say this
[03:06:29] but Grand Sage what you're saying
[03:06:32] doesn't make any sense
[03:06:34] how can the information in the Akasha be
[03:06:36] inaccurate what the Akasha decrees is
[03:06:39] fact that is common I've been live for
[03:06:41] four hours that we haven't fought it yet
[03:06:43] this is gonna be uh Knowledge from the
[03:06:45] Akasha ourselves
[03:06:46] then how is that any different from us
[03:06:48] learning that information ourselves
[03:06:50] wouldn't greater Lord Ruka devata's
[03:06:52] Legacy lose its meaning that way
[03:06:55] in the beginning it was I who asked you
[03:06:58] to believe in the Akasha to believe in
[03:07:00] the Legacy left by greater Lord Ruka
[03:07:02] devata are you trying to look at the
[03:07:04] Vata against me no Grand Sage I'm merely
[03:07:08] confused because I believe in you I
[03:07:11] never meant to refute you
[03:07:15] stay here and see if there are any
[03:07:17] suspicious people around I'll go to the
[03:07:19] sanctuary of surestana on my own
[03:07:22] it's really it's a good idea to go on
[03:07:23] your own yes grand Sage
[03:07:26] surely that's a good idea
[03:07:37] has escaped from the sanctuary of
[03:07:39] surestana go to the city and arrest the
[03:07:42] Escape immediately
[03:07:45] how can that be
[03:07:46] stop thinking about it stop
[03:07:50] it must be a trick of theirs as long as
[03:07:53] I personally confirm it
[03:07:56] surely surely No One's Gonna be waiting
[03:07:59] for you
[03:08:00] impossible that's impossible there must
[03:08:03] be something you better get with my eyes
[03:08:05] never mind
[03:08:13] what a comical sighters are
[03:08:16] geez
[03:08:18] once the Akasha has put certain thoughts
[03:08:21] into your head you have been told
[03:08:23] Sage can no longer see what's right in
[03:08:26] front of him you all can only see the
[03:08:29] world in your mind
[03:08:31] the one you think you know
[03:08:33] and precisely because of this
[03:08:36] you disregarded Lester Lord kusanali's
[03:08:40] existence judgment time she has been a
[03:08:43] wise and Worthy archon
[03:08:46] so I know
[03:08:48] have you been waiting for a chance like
[03:08:50] this hit him with your stick return to
[03:08:54] the Academia to confront me
[03:08:56] but I didn't expect it to turn out like
[03:08:59] this
[03:09:00] I was careless
[03:09:03] I mean Sunrise a paddle is his weapon
[03:09:06] your faults stem from your Reliance on
[03:09:08] the Akasha
[03:09:10] you're still the same as always I truly
[03:09:13] did not expect a proud person like you
[03:09:15] to cooperate with all Haytham and The
[03:09:17] Traveler
[03:09:18] people changes are
[03:09:21] admit it the Akasha and the Akasha the
[03:09:24] Akash is washed bro it's actually washed
[03:09:27] tell me what have you found during your
[03:09:30] investigation
[03:09:31] you want to buy time
[03:09:33] this is the sanctuary of surestana
[03:09:36] under you there's only one person
[03:09:38] spamming
[03:09:40] Bozo for an hour
[03:09:43] no one will come to save you as for the
[03:09:46] investigation
[03:09:48] I've at least confirmed that you are
[03:09:50] guilty of insurgence
[03:09:53] serious crime any more caffeine so what
[03:09:56] did you do all of this so I would plead
[03:09:59] guilty in front of you General mahamatra
[03:10:03] yes no oh I want you to please and she's
[03:10:07] there behind them you once said that I
[03:10:10] had no standing to judge you
[03:10:12] so now
[03:10:14] how about judgment in the name of a god
[03:10:20] wait do we get to kill him please let me
[03:10:22] kill him
[03:10:27] or not
[03:10:31] eight
[03:10:32] I know how things are going out there
[03:10:34] dude why don't we get to see him die
[03:10:37] surely we got to kill him
[03:10:40] something bad didn't happen
[03:10:42] yeah but aren't you scared that we might
[03:10:45] be locked up in here for the rest of our
[03:10:47] lives
[03:10:49] thinking about it at least Pokemon has
[03:10:52] you we can still chat like this when
[03:10:55] pymon thinks of nahida being imprisoned
[03:10:57] alone in the sanctuary I'd rather be
[03:10:59] imprisoned alone than me with you
[03:11:00] piemont I'm sorry but I said it someone
[03:11:02] had to say it
[03:11:07] here comes your savior
[03:11:10] hog
[03:11:18] you two really owe me some big thanks I
[03:11:21] had to search through who knows how many
[03:11:23] guards to find the key here it felt even
[03:11:25] more tiring than whacking them I'm
[03:11:27] exhausted thanks
[03:11:30] to rub your shoulders
[03:11:34] uh no no that's uh I'll pass what do you
[03:11:42] what do you now isn't the time to talk
[03:11:45] about being ticklish
[03:11:46] oh things in the city and on sino's side
[03:11:49] are both going well the guards that
[03:11:51] stormed out of the Academia are all
[03:11:53] taken care of the core of 30 is in
[03:11:55] charge of the city's defenses but we
[03:11:58] already talked to osfand they've been
[03:12:00] fed up with the sages bossing them
[03:12:01] around
[03:12:04] as long as it doesn't break their
[03:12:05] employment contracts they'll turn to
[03:12:07] Blind Eye that's probably because you've
[03:12:09] been super friends the grand Sage is in
[03:12:11] his custody
[03:12:12] even I know how terrible it is to fall
[03:12:14] into sino's hands so he probably does I
[03:12:17] feel like things are going too well
[03:12:18] there's gonna have to be like applause
[03:12:19] oh I didn't foresee this and then the
[03:12:22] [ __ ] Azar started spanking Sino and
[03:12:24] then we lose things when everything go
[03:12:27] well on every side something goes wrong
[03:12:28] this is why I hate when they don't show
[03:12:30] us us killing the [ __ ] enemies like
[03:12:32] show me US brutally murdering the
[03:12:34] [ __ ] Azar and brutally killing all
[03:12:36] the guards honestly I didn't because if
[03:12:39] not I don't trust it to do this well we
[03:12:41] just came together last minute to save
[03:12:43] the archon you know
[03:12:44] all right you two better go I still have
[03:12:47] to clean up some Messes in the city
[03:12:49] see you around
[03:12:51] dude surely when there's like an evil
[03:12:53] character the the the the point like it
[03:12:56] feels good to see them die like that's
[03:12:59] the point
[03:13:00] that's why there's evil characters
[03:13:07] [Music]
[03:13:12] me with Senora Senora did nothing wrong
[03:13:14] Rez her
[03:13:16] I'm on team Senora she ripped Bozo Venti
[03:13:19] venti deserved it

[03:13:33] whatever
[03:13:45] oh okay can we see it's nice to meet you
[03:13:49] this is the first time we've met in real
[03:13:51] life before we've only met in dreams
[03:13:54] Consciousness in someone else's body
[03:13:59] thank you so much for coming to rescue
[03:14:01] me but I also need to apologize
[03:14:05] during this time I did some
[03:14:08] self-reflection
[03:14:09] my sense of inferiority and yielding to
[03:14:12] the Academia led to all of this and
[03:14:15] created so much trouble for you all
[03:14:18] don't worry about it
[03:14:20] yeah you're a good archon he thinks you
[03:14:24] too
[03:14:26] amazing
[03:14:29] amazing walk out of that cage with my
[03:14:31] own body it's like I just had an
[03:14:34] endlessly long dream
[03:14:37] oh they just woke up or is only now born
[03:14:39] into this world
[03:14:41] my concept of self has become so clear
[03:14:46] but now it doesn't seem to be the time
[03:14:48] to indulge in this feeling
[03:14:51] wait what if you know how they're making
[03:14:54] Scaramouche into a god what if the fight
[03:14:56] the God would make our own God and it's
[03:14:58] an aranara we just make a big aranara
[03:15:00] and then they fight I'm down
[03:15:09] and she needs her help to save her
[03:15:11] country
[03:15:13] in the entire world it's okay with you
[03:15:16] there's one more thing what is it for
[03:15:18] all the things the Academia did to me
[03:15:20] and for all the Folly the name of wisdom
[03:15:24] as their archon I will make them pay oh
[03:15:28] God every time an archon has seek
[03:15:30] Vengeance it has never ended well
[03:15:32] oh God
[03:15:36] oh God
[03:15:39] [Music]
[03:15:44] no doubt how to be a caterpillar exactly
[03:15:46] you have to cocoon but I've been saying
[03:15:49] she's a Sox Watcher nahida welcome to
[03:15:51] the stream Nikita uh should have been in
[03:15:53] the trash for some time I'm telling you
[03:15:54] you have to Bloss you can't we're
[03:15:57] becoming a butterfly you have to cocoon
[03:15:59] first so you can blossom into a
[03:16:01] butterfly it's the age-old thing really
[03:16:03] age-old thing
[03:16:05] that reminds me
[03:16:07] I wonder how far along the Academia is
[03:16:10] with their God creation plan
[03:16:12] I wonder the birth of that false god
[03:16:21] to control it first things first I need
[03:16:24] to remove the restrictions that the
[03:16:26] doctor put on me in the Akasha after
[03:16:28] that I'll make some adjustments and
[03:16:30] revoke the Sage's permissions the Akasha
[03:16:33] will then be like how it originally was
[03:16:35] only operable by the archon after all
[03:16:39] Academia betrayed greater Lord Ruka de
[03:16:42] vasa's trust true this might take some
[03:16:44] time
[03:16:45] in the meantime you should also work on
[03:16:48] your own
[03:16:49] mods
[03:16:51] she's like six
[03:17:02] he might as well prepare for a fight

[03:18:16] in the Scara fight oh this is adorable
[03:18:19] though
[03:18:21] honestly it's a better pymon
[03:18:31] wait
[03:18:32] but should be helpful in certain
[03:18:33] situations
[03:18:39] yeah but it's not annoying

[03:19:44] best to provide support sure
[03:19:47] so the god of wisdom isn't good at
[03:19:49] fighting that acts I've located where
[03:19:52] the false god is
[03:19:53] time is of the essence so let's get to

[03:20:34] before did it she looks pretty
[03:20:38] wait did it look like this
[03:20:41] okay maybe just because it's night time
[03:20:43] I don't know maybe I've never been here
[03:20:45] oh night time okay I guess it just looks
[03:20:47] chat again I think
[03:20:48] why did you teleport wait I'm the same
[03:20:51] place
[03:20:54] I thought
[03:21:15] all right
[03:21:20] oh this looks
[03:21:23] awfully
[03:21:25] oh I didn't know you could check the
[03:21:26] enemies what the [ __ ] wait you can do
[03:21:28] that
[03:21:31] oh oh anyways
[03:21:34] I don't even know you can check that
[03:21:35] anyways I thought I was like maybe this
[03:21:37] is like scarra you know
[03:21:39] but maybe just in case if Scott I should
[03:21:41] bring a team that's not the Luke
[03:21:49] let me bring
[03:21:51] um
[03:21:55] why not [ __ ] okay we'll bring we'll
[03:21:57] bring his brother with him where the
[03:21:58] [ __ ] is Kaya actually no it's not
[03:22:03] wait we need Kazo for a domain I don't
[03:22:05] do a domain without Kaza
[03:22:11] where's kokomi
[03:22:14] let's move out
[03:22:20] cool it
[03:22:23] okay fine open Kaya this will be
[03:22:25] interesting exactly six months twice his
[03:22:28] life
[03:22:40] there'd be a place like this hidden
[03:22:42] right the stages wanted to realize their
[03:22:44] God creation plan without being
[03:22:45] discovered
[03:22:47] the safest and most convenient way would
[03:22:49] be to build within the world who is the
[03:22:51] second character I thought it was Xiao
[03:22:53] kazua kokomi official I mean who the
[03:22:57] [ __ ] my second character in the
[03:22:58] structure here the
[03:23:19] they wouldn't have been that generous
[03:23:24] thought that this doctor is true the
[03:23:27] Academia Sages
[03:23:29] he doesn't seem to share their sense of
[03:23:31] urgency
[03:23:32] instead of being interested in the end
[03:23:34] product I just noticed my monitor has
[03:23:37] like environmental color settings for
[03:23:39] like valerians it looks way more
[03:23:40] saturated than my second I thought
[03:23:42] characters looked like red like I wasn't
[03:23:44] sure if it was just me but it is just me
[03:23:45] because when I look at my second monitor
[03:23:46] they look normal well not red like it
[03:23:48] looked like they're like like the white
[03:23:50] looks red or not just white it doesn't
[03:23:52] matter what like character is they look
[03:23:54] like redder
[03:23:55] actually normal
[03:23:58] so question mark no I'm serious if you
[03:24:00] have like if you have it really
[03:24:01] saturated the colors look weird like on
[03:24:04] my second monitor it looks like normal
[03:24:05] colors here it looks like red
[03:24:09] whatever
[03:24:09] okay particularly strong objections
[03:24:12] whatever one is the desire for a gnosis
[03:24:15] since he was created to be the vessel
[03:24:17] for one
[03:24:18] the other obsession is probably really
[03:24:21] you can [ __ ] off
[03:24:23] I can't quite explain it
[03:24:26] he knows that he was a prototype puppet
[03:24:28] for the writing Shogun before he became
[03:24:29] a fatoui harbinger
[03:24:32] look at that to me as well you see
[03:24:33] that's what I'm saying so badly there's
[03:24:36] no way he'd willingly be a test subject
[03:24:38] now with that temper and ego of his
[03:24:41] it sounds like you know the ballet here
[03:24:43] quite well
[03:24:45] we've had a few encounters see
[03:24:47] tell me more about him and what he's
[03:24:49] like I mean he ballots he's a volunteer
[03:24:52] the more we know now the better we can
[03:24:54] plan for and react to any future
[03:24:56] situation no I know why scar has so many
[03:24:59] names he's okay he's The Wanderer right
[03:25:01] because not all wonders are lost but he
[03:25:04] is a lost child at heart so we have to
[03:25:07] save him making scarra good again true I
[03:25:10] just solved the plot of act Six coming
[03:25:13] out next patch

[03:34:11] with a gnosis
[03:34:13] are you nervous pymon
[03:34:15] if you really want to know

[03:34:23] want a child
[03:34:25] this is probably yeah I'm trying to get

[03:35:08] well
[03:35:09] curious
[03:35:11] yes about what curious about their fate
[03:35:14] oh
[03:35:15] Our Fate everything we perceive in this
[03:35:18] world everything we learn and everything
[03:35:21] that happens to us is considered
[03:35:22] knowledge
[03:35:24] and if it's a form of knowledge then it
[03:35:26] can be it's 26 gigs only fate is about
[03:35:30] that which has yet to occur so it is
[03:35:33] always drawn my curiosity
[03:35:35] so to me fate is the ultimate knowledge
[03:35:40] that's also why I love observing humans
[03:35:43] and all the things that happen to them
[03:35:45] it all brings me great satisfaction
[03:35:49] and now at long last I'm not just an
[03:35:52] observer anymore oh I don't personally
[03:35:55] experience my own faith with you by my
[03:35:58] side

[03:36:02] thing

[03:37:54] and standing beside you the traveler yes
[03:37:59] [Music]
[03:38:02] no I can't feel the same kind of
[03:38:05] divinity I felt from the greater Lord it
[03:38:08] seems that the sages didn't get the
[03:38:10] chance to infuse the Divine knowledge
[03:38:11] capsules into him
[03:38:13] but even still he has undoubtedly become
[03:38:16] a true God now
[03:38:20] late thank God
[03:38:22] [Music]
[03:38:26] just roasted a long Flygon title
[03:38:30] when my spirit is sent it to Divinity I
[03:38:33] felt as if I had existed for the same
[03:38:34] number of epochs as Heaven and Earth
[03:38:37] looking back the existence of what once
[03:38:40] called itself Kuni kazushi appears
[03:38:43] infinitely small and ugly oh my God no
[03:38:45] way another name wait is he kunikazushi
[03:38:48] wait does he have wait something
[03:38:54] how many days
[03:39:00] a body that capitalizes on the
[03:39:02] balladeer's original construction as a
[03:39:04] mechanical puppet with the nurses
[03:39:07] serving as a constant power supply
[03:39:12] just put into this
[03:39:14] perspective
[03:39:22] dude he does like literally about to die
[03:39:24] a low-key against the giant ass Mech and
[03:39:26] she's just talking about how it's from a
[03:39:29] technological perspective it's a
[03:39:30] commendable achievement
[03:39:33] run bro
[03:39:35] you just said you're not good at
[03:39:37] fighting
[03:39:38] but I don't think he's reached the
[03:39:40] spiritual height of a god
[03:39:43] hello dish so he's still the same on
[03:39:45] same old valadeer on the inside I'm not
[03:39:47] sure that's a good or a bad thing I'm
[03:39:48] telling you Scarlet just needs a hug so
[03:39:50] the Tory is certifiably objectively
[03:39:54] purely too far gone to ever save he's
[03:39:56] just insane but scarra we can still hug
[03:39:58] him
[03:40:00] Strife is engraved upon every God and
[03:40:03] every noses brought forth into this
[03:40:05] world
[03:40:07] Can you feel it the exhilaration of such
[03:40:10] power and the thrill of it okay
[03:40:14] it sounds like
[03:40:16] scar sounds like
[03:40:18] he thinks he's ciao he's like that's
[03:40:20] what I think it is I think Scaro wants
[03:40:22] to be Shao I think that's that's my
[03:40:24] thought I think he wishes he was a child
[03:40:25] that's all I think of the same things as
[03:40:28] you do you not realize that you are
[03:40:31] interrupting a conversation between it's
[03:40:34] like a different type of energy lowly
[03:40:36] creature know your place down know your
[03:40:39] place
[03:40:41] The Strife engraved Upon A gnosis you're
[03:40:45] talking about the archon war
[03:40:47] to that's current piece was not easily
[03:40:50] won
[03:40:51] I didn't personally participate in the
[03:40:53] archon war but the way I see it
[03:40:57] all those losses were meaningless driven
[03:41:00] by the demands of the laws there's no
[03:41:02] point in bringing it up again
[03:41:04] [Laughter]
[03:41:06] is that so yet I am Arcane I love our
[03:41:11] game wow the fortuity to personally
[03:41:13] participate in the archon war

[03:41:19] encountering a God in this world who
[03:41:22] doesn't yeah dude he was actually a base

[03:53:27] just dead
[03:53:32] already
[03:53:38] we may now finally understand the last
[03:53:41] memory of Greater Lord Ruka devata
[03:53:47] [Music]
[03:53:50] this is
[03:53:53] that's right
[03:53:54] this is a last memory of my predecessor
[03:54:06] oh
[03:54:07] [Music]
[03:54:09] what the [ __ ]
[03:54:14] huh
[03:54:18] I imagined should an Urban Soul be in
[03:54:21] this realm of consciousness
[03:54:23] yes that is our destination
[03:54:27] but I didn't expect okay no spoilers
[03:54:29] Chad I just remember Drew telling me or
[03:54:33] is that a jiter Fang one of them told me
[03:54:34] the ending as I kind of [ __ ] so I
[03:54:37] don't know but yeah I just know
[03:54:39] something's coming I just don't know
[03:54:41] what
[03:54:46] it seems you know about the concept that
[03:54:48] even I don't completely understand
[03:54:51] could you tell me what you know
[03:54:55] [Music]
[03:54:58] you're in front seems logical enough
[03:55:01] Forbidden Knowledge once polluted the
[03:55:04] desert thousands of years ago but was
[03:55:06] successfully repelled thanks to King
[03:55:08] duster itself also wonder what happens
[03:55:09] to Scara now
[03:55:11] is he still an angry boy the knowledge
[03:55:13] pollution occurred during the conoria
[03:55:15] cataclysm 500 years ago but I'm afraid
[03:55:18] it is much more serious this time with
[03:55:21] Urban Soul itself because there's no way
[03:55:22] you rip Bozo from jumping out of your
[03:55:24] Mac like it's not that surely I don't
[03:55:26] know we'll see
[03:55:37] does that mean
[03:55:38] that mean in order to save us greater
[03:55:41] Lord Rook devata yes
[03:55:44] it's very possible that she sacrificed
[03:55:46] her life in the fight against Forbidden
[03:55:48] Knowledge she didn't completely
[03:55:50] eradicate forbidden knowledge but if
[03:55:53] it's born for her actions Forbidden
[03:55:55] Knowledge would have been far more
[03:55:56] rampant it's the child the child Dory
[03:55:58] team
[03:56:00] the way that everyone The Forbidden
[03:56:02] Theory crafting everything about
[03:56:04] forbidden knowledge may very well be due
[03:56:07] to her restoration of Urban Soul
[03:56:15] sorry pain
[03:56:18] the pollution of her Consciousness here
[03:56:21] is severe
[03:56:22] there's Madness chaos and pain all
[03:56:25] around us did she fight to resist the
[03:56:28] Forbidden Knowledge pollution in such
[03:56:29] terrible conditions all the way up to
[03:56:32] her last breath she even used Her Last
[03:56:35] Remnant of lucid Consciousness to leave
[03:56:37] a clue for us to follow
[03:56:40] yes her words were distorted by
[03:56:43] Forbidden Knowledge so that's all we
[03:56:45] could hear but now we have a chance to
[03:56:49] find the answer to this mystery we can
[03:56:51] cross the polluted Consciousness until
[03:56:53] we found the right path to meet with her
[03:56:55] Lucid consciousness
[03:56:57] and then we'll let greater Lord Ruka
[03:57:00] dapata tell us the truth in person
[03:57:03] each of us need to be mindful of the
[03:57:06] state of our own Consciousness while we
[03:57:08] are here even with the narcissus
[03:57:10] protection we must always keep a clear
[03:57:12] mind otherwise we could go mad at any
[03:57:16] moment
[03:57:18] don't worry it should be easy enough for
[03:57:21] you to keep that mind of yours clearly
[03:57:26] roasted by an archon
[03:57:29] all right
[03:57:32] y in the air why is there a huge boat
[03:57:36] that's the ball of Consciousness wait
[03:57:38] where the [ __ ] are we
[03:57:41] oh
[03:57:41] man yeah what if we wish you what if we
[03:57:44] tumble
[03:57:47] [ __ ] if we had calls I could hold
[03:57:51] it so I thought I'd bring calls though
[03:57:52] guys
[03:58:02] not touch this
[03:58:04] it's in poor slime
[03:58:27] okay I don't feel bad about the rift
[03:58:28] towns though
[03:58:30] please
[03:58:41] what
[03:58:43] happened
[03:58:47] freeze
[03:58:49] did my characters other than Xiao are
[03:58:52] not geared bro how am I supposed to kill
[03:58:53] these guys
[03:58:56] [Music]
[03:59:02] [Music]
[03:59:09] yeah
[03:59:11] why are there hilly Trails here but I
[03:59:13] don't get it how the [ __ ] did we get
[03:59:14] here
[03:59:24] where these illegals come from
[03:59:44] foreign
[04:00:01] foreign
[04:00:03] [Music]
[04:00:08] wait there's a oh no that wasn't for
[04:00:10] this
[04:00:13] guy C6 I think so
[04:00:20] but it looks so dead he had McDonald's
[04:00:22] true I'm actually dead because of
[04:00:24] McDonald's bro
[04:00:29] I'm back I'm focused I'm focused
[04:00:32] we back
[04:00:52] I know something's gonna happen soon
[04:00:59] what if this whole time
[04:01:02] no I'm not gonna say it
[04:01:04] because if I say like a fake guess then
[04:01:06] it's gonna bait real spoilers which I
[04:01:08] don't want so we'll figure it out
[04:01:10] together
[04:01:11] this time we should be able to meet
[04:01:14] greater Lord Ruka devata are you saying
[04:01:17] you've never met greater Lord Ruka
[04:01:19] divata before no it seems that my birth
[04:01:23] and her death took place okay remember
[04:01:25] when we saw adult nahira at the end of
[04:01:27] the last act that's either gonna be
[04:01:29] because I still don't know if that's her
[04:01:30] if that's the greater Lord so I guess
[04:01:33] we'll see now
[04:01:38] but I remember last act we saw like
[04:01:40] adults
[04:01:42] so we'll see
[04:01:44] we'll see
[04:01:46] hopefully scar is not actually dead
[04:01:48] that'd be a funny way to die he just
[04:01:50] falls out of his neck surely he's
[04:01:53] chilling
[04:01:58] they'll be a pretty stupid way to die
[04:02:01] let's fix this
[04:02:02] can I jump off
[04:02:04] wait I can
[04:02:07] can I wish I can't
[04:02:15] what if I keep dying
[04:02:21] [Music]
[04:02:32] well
[04:02:34] this is the place
[04:02:37] yes
[04:02:40] we're here to find greater look what the
[04:02:43] one standing over there is is that
[04:02:49] he looks exactly
[04:02:51] like me
[04:02:53] are you greater Lord rookie davata yes
[04:02:58] that's me are you surprised by my
[04:03:01] opinion it's like the renora they forget
[04:03:03] when they become a tree the forest
[04:03:05] remembers
[04:03:07] sorry
[04:03:09] Airmen soul and the surrounding lands
[04:03:11] have been reproduced here as they were
[04:03:13] years ago
[04:03:14] but this is just around the
[04:03:16] consciousness
[04:03:18] we are manifestations of the same nature
[04:03:21] hence why we would appear exactly the
[04:03:23] same okay that makes sense
[04:03:27] we're
[04:03:28] of the same nature
[04:03:30] because you are me and I am you
[04:03:35] you are me in the new samsara
[04:03:39] the [ __ ] is a samsara
[04:03:41] the new samsara
[04:03:44] should I Google that I'm Googling it
[04:03:46] is that a word is that like an English
[04:03:47] word samsara aren't those like like
[04:03:50] samosas
[04:03:56] samsara the cycle of death and rebirth
[04:03:58] with to which life in the material world
[04:04:01] is bound
[04:04:02] okay as greater Lord Ruka devata I'm the
[04:04:06] Avatar of Urban Soul
[04:04:08] and you are the purest Branch snapped
[04:04:10] from Urban Soul
[04:04:13] this way
[04:04:15] even if a tree dies its branches will
[04:04:18] eventually take root and grow
[04:04:20] continuing the tree's life in another
[04:04:22] form wait it's actually a throwback to
[04:04:24] the RNR request I'm telling you the r
[04:04:26] r's are archons true
[04:04:28] I'm merely the remaining consciousness
[04:04:30] of Greater Lord Ruka devata the real me
[04:04:33] has presumably died a long time ago
[04:04:38] um
[04:04:40] judging from your appearance I've
[04:04:43] probably been dead for 500 years okay we
[04:04:46] knew that
[04:04:49] but you're finally here
[04:04:51] My New Self in the samsara
[04:04:59] if this is true then am I
[04:05:03] imagine she's just like no
[04:05:05] no you suck imagine
[04:05:10] [Music]
[04:05:11] our Fates are bound to be different
[04:05:14] all things have their own fate
[04:05:17] when a branch grows into a mature tree
[04:05:20] it won't be the same as the original
[04:05:22] tree
[04:05:23] that's why fate is the ultimate
[04:05:25] knowledge isn't it cause the forest
[04:05:28] remembers
[04:05:30] that's a great Insight yes very good
[04:05:34] it's also precisely why you won't become
[04:05:36] like me
[04:05:38] really but perhaps you may become an
[04:05:42] even greater arkline than I
[04:05:45] I already see a determination in you
[04:05:47] that I didn't possess in my time and the
[04:05:50] future that it leads you to will be
[04:05:52] yours alone
[04:05:55] With the blessings from your past
[04:05:57] experiences
[04:06:01] don't worry the growth of wisdom is like
[04:06:04] that of a plant
[04:06:06] you only need to wait quietly for the
[04:06:08] flowers what if you nip the flower in
[04:06:10] the bud so it doesn't bloom that's what
[04:06:12] Cincinnati was Sir that he was
[04:06:13] referencing he knew this all along you
[04:06:15] nip it in the bud so it doesn't Bloom he
[04:06:17] knew
[04:06:18] don't type huh you know what nipping
[04:06:20] means it's like you cut the butt of a
[04:06:22] flower before it blooms the the bloom he
[04:06:25] was referencing that
[04:06:30] I have faith in nahita too definitely
[04:06:33] become a great archon think of it
[04:06:37] [Music]
[04:06:42] nothing makes me happier than
[04:06:43] discovering that the arkane always
[04:06:45] admired was in fact myself in another
[04:06:48] fate
[04:06:49] it's so nice to speak with you greater
[04:06:52] Lord Ruka devata
[04:06:54] I've always wanted to meet you
[04:06:57] the feeling is mutual
[04:06:59] from the moment I snapped the branch
[04:07:01] Offerman Sully created you I've also
[04:07:04] looked forward to talking with you
[04:07:06] know why is the Justice people chatting
[04:07:09] the same line over and over
[04:07:14] I'm not gonna read that out loud like I
[04:07:16] said no spoilers and you type oh my God
[04:07:18] there's so much I'm not gonna read that
[04:07:19] I said hi to you I said hey he's the dev
[04:07:21] I'm not gonna read your freaking
[04:07:23] could you tell me why you wanted to
[04:07:27] create me
[04:07:28] and what exactly happened when you died
[04:07:34] ah I see you're here seeking answers
[04:07:37] right sometimes
[04:07:39] everything that day
[04:07:41] even the sky itself changed into a color
[04:07:44] like this
[04:07:46] at that time the seven were all summoned
[04:07:49] to the nation of conria
[04:07:51] except for me
[04:07:53] oh it's a reference to when we signed
[04:07:56] the the constitution of Canada the the
[04:07:58] Declaration and Quebec's leader wasn't
[04:08:02] there he didn't get asked so he
[04:08:03] technically never signed it which is the
[04:08:05] one of the Seven Nations so it's a
[04:08:07] throwback it's a shout out we remember
[04:08:09] we remember true true that's why Quebec
[04:08:13] doesn't uh this avows the king uh
[04:08:16] doesn't accept the king dude if you're
[04:08:18] Canadian you know this Lord trust me
[04:08:20] this is true Canadian lore
[04:08:22] it is uh the seven were some into the
[04:08:24] nation of kanriya except for me I
[04:08:27] attacked the disaster occurred together
[04:08:30] with the pollution of forbidden
[04:08:32] knowledge
[04:08:33] at that very moment with my
[04:08:36] Consciousness connected to Urban Soul
[04:08:38] I sense something was wrong
[04:08:41] okay the pain started to torment my mind
[04:08:44] by the time I reached Herman's Soul it
[04:08:47] was already displaying signs of
[04:08:49] corruption
[04:08:52] had I not repelled the pollution of
[04:08:54] forbidden knowledge with King deshardt
[04:08:56] thousands 30 years ago I'm getting
[04:08:58] distracted by the drafts
[04:08:59] stop living the same word over and over
[04:09:02] bro what are you doing
[04:09:03] [Music]
[04:09:07] okay
[04:09:08] okay
[04:09:10] let me look
[04:09:13] I need to focus I
[04:09:16] had I not revealed the pollution of the
[04:09:18] Forbidden Knowledge with King destroy a
[04:09:19] thousand years ago I might have felt
[04:09:20] even more hopeless and lost so
[04:09:23] [Music]
[04:09:27] oh this is what we're gonna learn I'm I
[04:09:29] have my theory I told you guys knowledge
[04:09:31] that doesn't belong to this world
[04:09:33] and a form of truth that can't be
[04:09:36] understood true
[04:09:40] it came from the very bottom of the
[04:09:42] Abyss from the abyss I told you you'd
[04:09:45] never understand it's the child Dory
[04:09:46] double dendro team it's forbidden
[04:09:48] because no one wants to level a second
[04:09:50] Denver character and Dory but that's the
[04:09:52] truth from the bottom of the Abyss it's
[04:09:54] Forbidden Knowledge true the world is
[04:09:58] constantly rejecting it leading to all
[04:10:01] kinds of bad phenomena
[04:10:04] if we allow forbidden knowledge to
[04:10:06] pollute airman's soul
[04:10:08] I'm afraid the entirety of tavat could
[04:10:11] fall apart
[04:10:13] so there's knowledge that even the god
[04:10:16] of wisdom can't understand at that time
[04:10:19] I knew I couldn't repel The Forbidden
[04:10:22] Knowledge with my strength alone
[04:10:25] okay which is why I created a device
[04:10:27] that compiled human wisdom and named it
[04:10:30] the Akasha
[04:10:34] it's truly the world's most amazing
[04:10:37] invention
[04:10:39] thank you
[04:10:42] for a long time I thought dreams were
[04:10:45] the fruit of human wisdom
[04:10:50] um
[04:10:52] shut up
[04:10:54] hey thank you for a long time I thought
[04:10:56] jeans are the fruit of human wisdom that
[04:10:58] would selfish to do so
[04:11:01] I've heard people's dreams using
[04:11:03] Shah
[04:11:05] Sim and all of my own power
[04:11:09] okay well did it work no thanks to the
[04:11:12] wisdom of the people sumeru almost all
[04:11:15] the Forbidden Knowledge was cleared for
[04:11:16] mermancel but
[04:11:19] things didn't go as smoothly as I
[04:11:21] thought
[04:11:22] I had a terrible headache which gave me
[04:11:25] an uneven feeling oh
[04:11:28] and then
[04:11:30] I remembered that my Consciousness was
[04:11:32] also connected with Herman's soul
[04:11:34] it brought me knowledge and wisdom
[04:11:37] vile corruption as well from the very
[04:11:41] beginning
[04:11:42] my existence had been polluted by The
[04:11:45] Forbidden Knowledge
[04:11:47] oh no how could that happen I've
[04:11:50] experienced that pain in your
[04:11:52] consciousness
[04:11:54] it must have been a horrible experience
[04:11:56] yes
[04:11:58] but my feelings weren't important
[04:12:00] thing was that
[04:12:04] even if I died
[04:12:06] my existence and everything related to
[04:12:09] me would continue to exist in Urban Soul
[04:12:12] as memories and knowledge
[04:12:15] meaning that the Forbidden Knowledge
[04:12:17] couldn't ever be permanently eradicated
[04:12:20] and
[04:12:21] there's no way for me to eliminate
[04:12:23] myself
[04:12:25] it would be a sort of paradox
[04:12:29] so
[04:12:30] I took the purest branch of Urban Solace
[04:12:33] my incarnation in the next samsara and
[04:12:37] left a trail of Clues all in hopes that
[04:12:40] you would come here and remove me and my
[04:12:43] pollution from Urban Soul forever
[04:12:48] oh that makes sense wait no
[04:12:55] so you realize what that implies
[04:12:57] you are very smart indeed
[04:13:06] airman's Soul has all the knowledge and
[04:13:08] memories of this world
[04:13:10] and as you've realized just now removing
[04:13:13] me from Urban Soul means
[04:13:16] I essentially will never have existed in
[04:13:18] this world oh
[04:13:27] damn that's like an R&R it's an R&R
[04:13:30] Quest all over again she's a radish
[04:13:33] oranara are cabbages
[04:13:35] I knew it
[04:13:36] she's an rnara
[04:13:41] damn rip
[04:13:44] but
[04:13:46] this is the only way to save Herman's
[04:13:49] soul
[04:13:50] I love you so much
[04:13:52] they've missed you so much over the past
[04:13:55] five five years
[04:13:57] I
[04:13:58] I am exactly the same
[04:14:01] so how
[04:14:03] can we just
[04:14:05] forget you like this
[04:14:07] is there really no other way
[04:14:10] there must be something else I can do
[04:14:15] wait what if you just
[04:14:17] no I'm gonna say some dumb [ __ ] I I
[04:14:18] don't want to ruin the moment but what
[04:14:20] if she just
[04:14:21] never mind
[04:14:24] you're the god of wisdom Boomer
[04:14:26] you should know that there is no other
[04:14:28] way
[04:14:35] forget you
[04:14:37] yeah it's kind of [ __ ]
[04:14:40] oh have you guys watched Memento the guy
[04:14:42] with like short-term members what if you
[04:14:43] just write it on like a note like what
[04:14:45] if you just write everything that
[04:14:46] happens you'll forget but then there'll
[04:14:47] be like a note
[04:14:48] can you just take a picture
[04:14:50] no it removes no way deleting her from
[04:14:52] the world removes the note the note will
[04:14:54] stay there can you just explain like
[04:14:56] dialogue everything write it down
[04:15:03] whatever no need to feel so sad booer
[04:15:06] if a note stays and defeats a purpose
[04:15:08] okay true you should feel Joy at finally
[04:15:11] just tattoo it on your arm
[04:15:16] these are the words in their entirety
[04:15:19] the answer you've been seeking all along
[04:15:23] let the world completely forget me
[04:15:27] now
[04:15:33] we all Nestle under the great tree of
[04:15:36] wisdom peering out to perceive the world
[04:15:40] from the earth and from the rain we
[04:15:42] perceive as follows until we become a
[04:15:45] white bird to purge Atop A branch
[04:15:48] and finally snap off the most important
[04:15:51] leaf
[04:15:55] Once Upon Time I alone dreamed in this
[04:15:58] world
[04:16:00] in my dreams everybody would also dream
[04:16:03] after they fell asleep
[04:16:06] wild and wonderful thoughts would emerge
[04:16:09] from their minds
[04:16:10] some tumble to the ground and others
[04:16:13] floated to the sky
[04:16:16] connecting all things in the world into
[04:16:18] one dazzling net
[04:16:21] among a plethora of Worlds were numerous
[04:16:24] smaller worlds all of Fate finding
[04:16:28] within the tapestry their brilliant glow
[04:16:32] I gradually understood that these
[04:16:35] Indescribable and constantly changing
[04:16:38] things
[04:16:39] are the most profound things in the
[04:16:41] world
[04:16:42] holy day
[04:16:44] can completely repel the madness
[04:16:47] only dreams can awaken Consciousness
[04:16:50] from the deepest Darkness
[04:16:59] um
[04:17:04] [Music]
[04:17:11] I'm the one who posed this question
[04:17:15] yet also the one who sought a solution
[04:17:18] saving the world with the dreams of the
[04:17:20] people he used to be my answer
[04:17:22] and now you've also found your own
[04:17:25] answer and I shall return all the dreams
[04:17:29] to the people
[04:17:31] [Music]
[04:17:44] goodbye people sumeru
[04:17:48] may you be blessed tonight
[04:17:50] but sweetest dreams
[04:17:53] boom
[04:18:00] down
[04:18:03] foreign
[04:18:34] we use the power of two noses to
[04:18:37] successfully connect with the Urban Soul
[04:18:39] Consciousness from 500 years ago
[04:18:44] then
[04:18:45] we removed the remaining pollution from
[04:18:49] merman's Soul oh we remember
[04:18:52] okay I know this is I know you guys are
[04:18:55] like that defeats the purpose that's
[04:18:56] illegal I know the FBI is going to want
[04:18:59] to know my location for asking this but
[04:19:00] what if we just told her
[04:19:02] do we does the FBI contact that like are
[04:19:05] we are we not supposed to ask that
[04:19:06] question
[04:19:08] what if we're just like yo by the way
[04:19:14] okay yeah that's fun weren't you there
[04:19:17] just now
[04:19:21] did you just die
[04:19:28] the pollution will come back
[04:19:35] can you tell other people that not her
[04:19:38] as long as I hate them those I'm
[04:19:40] chilling
[04:19:41] no you
[04:19:46] it defeats the purpose no no I get what
[04:19:48] the purpose is but like what if you tell
[04:19:50] some random dude what it just comes back
[04:19:52] I'm just telling something random dude
[04:19:53] I'm saying oh got polluted now
[04:19:57] surely that's not how it works
[04:20:02] so if I just say it into the world it
[04:20:05] just
[04:20:06] okay
[04:20:09] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[04:20:14] oh no it's the Men in Black when they
[04:20:16] make you like loot forget your memory
[04:20:18] [Music]
[04:20:25] actually now that I think about it we
[04:20:26] haven't seen dotari in a while surely he
[04:20:28] pulls up
[04:20:29] wait was that actually the Tory
[04:20:34] wait wait no I saw it in pre-watch it
[04:20:47] all the precious time I wasted has
[04:20:49] finally paid off
[04:20:52] the doctor
[04:20:54] what if you've done
[04:20:55] just a type of sound wave that can
[04:20:58] quickly put defenseless people into a
[04:21:00] dream as I expected it doesn't have any
[04:21:04] effect on gods
[04:21:06] this is the only thing but how does it
[04:21:08] affect us if the other thing didn't
[04:21:09] affect us
[04:21:11] I thought I'd take it for a little spin
[04:21:14] don't worry I know you would never
[04:21:17] forgive me if I actually killed damn
[04:21:19] we're immune to the brainwash change but
[04:21:22] we're not immune to sound with you oh no
[04:21:25] a buzzing sound dangerous that could
[04:21:27] potentially damage our relationship I'm
[04:21:31] just gonna say that means we I've been
[04:21:33] living with tinnitus for like 10 years
[04:21:34] now and I'm fine meanwhile luminus
[04:21:37] here's a slight buzz and she's on the
[04:21:39] ground
[04:21:40] negotiate with me I heard you had
[04:21:43] already left sumero why are you here
[04:21:45] again now I left sumero but I also still
[04:21:50] got clones even the god of wisdom is
[04:21:53] restricted by the habits of cognition
[04:21:57] how disappointing
[04:22:02] [Music]
[04:22:04] an astute guess
[04:22:08] even the same individual how do you know
[04:22:10] oh I thought it was widespread knowledge
[04:22:11] that the story could call himself
[04:22:13] I thought we just knew was this not
[04:22:15] public knowledge like not just something
[04:22:18] I just knew I thought we just knew
[04:22:21] from the manga
[04:22:23] I think it's because when we saw old
[04:22:25] daughter that had like the jester-ish
[04:22:27] mask that looked a bit more like Shaco
[04:22:28] that I was like that looks kind of
[04:22:30] Cooler
[04:22:31] uh and then people in chat were like
[04:22:33] that's a different version so I guess I
[04:22:34] just assumed he had clones yeah
[04:22:36] a long time ago I made a major decision
[04:22:40] observing all my perspectives of how I
[04:22:42] observed the world
[04:22:44] observation is the first step of any
[04:22:47] experiment but observing the current
[04:22:49] world doesn't satisfy me it lacks an
[04:22:53] important Dimension that of time
[04:22:57] so I saved segments of all my ages and
[04:23:01] made them into independent individuals
[04:23:04] that's all there is to it
[04:23:06] indulge me how does the god of wisdom
[04:23:09] find my method of seeking knowledge
[04:23:12] it's an insult to the very concept of
[04:23:15] life
[04:23:16] life inherently has many rules and
[04:23:18] restrictions each with its own
[04:23:20] significance and reason to exist they
[04:23:23] can't be broken on the whim
[04:23:24] [Laughter]
[04:23:26] good
[04:23:28] amazing even
[04:23:30] indeed it's difficult for humans to make
[04:23:33] peace with themselves not to mention
[04:23:36] oneself from a different period
[04:23:39] since you're in the Academia why wait
[04:23:42] until now to show up you could very well
[04:23:45] have stopped us and helped that fake God
[04:23:48] simple let me ask you this would any
[04:23:51] staff member ever help the subject in
[04:23:54] the middle of an experiment it was my
[04:23:57] experiment so why should I interfere
[04:24:00] with them the times that [ __ ] scarra I
[04:24:02] don't care about that guy
[04:24:04] as their own
[04:24:07] their alt is an ordinary experiment
[04:24:12] you really are crazy
[04:24:15] if the experiment succeeded you would
[04:24:17] have had a new God on your hands
[04:24:19] how would you have faced your own God
[04:24:21] then
[04:24:21] would you still take the same stance
[04:24:24] would you still kind of feel more for
[04:24:26] scar now
[04:24:27] because scar doesn't feel evil compared
[04:24:29] to the story the story is actually evil
[04:24:31] scar this feels like a good child it's
[04:24:33] kind of Angie
[04:24:34] confronted with that outcome
[04:24:37] but you're right
[04:24:39] and that's exactly why I'm disappointed
[04:24:41] with the conclusion of this experiment
[04:24:44] even at the end he was used like he's
[04:24:46] literally used all the time to say I'm
[04:24:47] gonna become a god this is the Tory
[04:24:49] puppeting him
[04:24:51] though
[04:24:55] poor Scaro
[04:24:57] wait what was this
[04:25:01] as an individual you don't have any
[04:25:04] sense of belonging and you seem to have
[04:25:06] even fewer convictions than a typical
[04:25:08] scholar
[04:25:10] oh no I certainly have my own
[04:25:12] convictions they just don't fit your
[04:25:15] standards that's all all right that's
[04:25:18] enough conversation for today the
[04:25:21] experiment is over and it's time to tidy
[04:25:24] up the equipment and reclaim any useful
[04:25:28] materials for example
[04:25:31] the gnosis
[04:25:35] lesser Lord kusanali You're an
[04:25:38] intelligent archon I'm sure you
[04:25:40] understand the disparity in our combat
[04:25:42] abilities at this time true besides you
[04:25:46] have no way to use that electronosis in
[04:25:49] battle
[04:25:50] we're here to
[04:25:52] [Music]
[04:25:57] no [ __ ] I'm merely stating a fact
[04:26:02] he said I can solo you
[04:26:05] know true scholar naturally I hope to
[04:26:08] show proper respect and dignity to the
[04:26:12] god of wisdom that's got a base for him
[04:26:14] you know
[04:26:14] it's pretty based I respect them for
[04:26:17] that
[04:26:26] awaken
[04:26:28] the Heavenly principles
[04:26:31] hmm
[04:26:33] do you think that's really possible he's
[04:26:36] just like do it
[04:26:37] for many years but the noses are symbols
[04:26:41] of their control over to that and all
[04:26:43] the laws will the destruction of a
[04:26:45] gnosis attract the attention of the
[04:26:47] Heavenly principles
[04:26:49] and if so
[04:26:51] I'll do the fatouli plan to deal with
[04:26:53] the consequences
[04:26:54] do you dare to gamble such a possibility
[04:26:58] with me
[04:27:00] Gamble
[04:27:01] how surprising
[04:27:03] I thought you would show evidence or use
[04:27:06] rigorous reasoning to prove your point
[04:27:08] the word gamble is the last thing I
[04:27:12] expected to hear I know it's like gotcha
[04:27:14] games when the god of wisdom gambles
[04:27:17] [Music]
[04:27:19] you must have seen through me when I
[04:27:21] first captured your consciousness
[04:27:27] as a scholar I respect all possibilities
[04:27:31] this has always been my principle and is
[04:27:34] an essential trait as an experimenter
[04:27:39] I can't ignore this possibility
[04:27:42] so tell me then
[04:27:44] what are your conditions this foreign
[04:27:52] this electromosis is the price I
[04:27:54] attained after defeating one of your
[04:27:56] fellow harbingers
[04:27:58] now
[04:27:59] as the one who initiated this Cascade of
[04:28:01] events shouldn't you pay the
[04:28:04] corresponding price
[04:28:07] interesting what price would you have me
[04:28:11] pay
[04:28:13] well they're racing all your other
[04:28:14] segments
[04:28:18] so this is how you wish to restrict me
[04:28:21] the most threatening opponent of the
[04:28:23] nation of wisdom
[04:28:25] what's your request of me is like
[04:28:28] plucking out the eyes I have placed in
[04:28:30] the dimension of time
[04:28:32] segments are extraordinarily difficult
[04:28:34] to make they require extremely rare
[04:28:37] resources and enormous amounts of time
[04:28:39] and effort
[04:28:41] requiring me to destroy them all here
[04:28:43] and now
[04:28:44] it literally told them to
[04:28:48] reforms himself
[04:28:51] yes okay okay don't spend that don't
[04:28:54] chat that would be to us can I assume
[04:28:56] that you have long been wary of me
[04:28:58] among all the versions of me this
[04:29:01] segmentation
[04:29:05] wait I'm gonna go divisions the segment
[04:29:06] you see now is no selfish
[04:29:10] did you see or imprisoned
[04:29:13] you were observing me and that's how you
[04:29:16] know I've long grown tired of their
[04:29:18] doubts and endless arguments
[04:29:21] like you said it's difficult to make
[04:29:24] peace with yourself
[04:29:25] being as smart as you are have you
[04:29:28] managed to do that
[04:29:30] hmm
[04:29:32] I see
[04:29:33] if you think all those versions of me
[04:29:35] are worth unnosis
[04:29:38] then deal
[04:29:43] you really don't hesitate much
[04:29:46] is the really
[04:29:47] the really all the versions of
[04:29:49] versions that bad I don't think there's
[04:29:52] any need to dwell on that
[04:29:54] the Surplus versions of me can be
[04:29:55] exchanged for a gnosis
[04:29:58] do you think anyone can offer themselves
[04:30:00] at a higher price
[04:30:02] besides with my abilities it's only a
[04:30:06] matter of time until I find better
[04:30:08] perspectives
[04:30:11] perhaps it's best to say you're just
[04:30:14] temporarily no he said I hate myself
[04:30:16] what I'd like to know is how can you be
[04:30:20] sure that I've really erased them
[04:30:23] you can see you're remaining honesty
[04:30:30] what hmm
[04:30:36] what a ridiculous decision you can't be
[04:30:39] serious how could I have been doing so
[04:30:44] yours count
[04:30:50] wait there has to be a Voice sign
[04:30:53] s okay notorious alta's Gonna Be Good
[04:30:55] Riddance it sounded too professionally
[04:30:57] recorded
[04:31:03] the future of Samira City will be in my
[04:31:06] hands alone
[04:31:08] I will shut down the Akasha and let
[04:31:10] curiosity and the thirst for knowledge
[04:31:12] Drive the realm of academics once again
[04:31:15] there won't be any further gaps for you
[04:31:17] to exploit
[04:31:18] it truly pains me that my academic
[04:31:21] achievements have never been appreciated
[04:31:23] in my homeland
[04:31:25] of course I have no interest in being
[04:31:28] rejected by this city for a third time
[04:31:32] another chess piece
[04:31:34] and where is your dendronosis
[04:31:41] no this is a different transaction if
[04:31:45] you intend to turn off the Akasha anyway
[04:31:47] then there's no further use for the
[04:31:50] gnosis of sumeru is there okay no way
[04:31:53] she gives it isn't it the archon's duty
[04:31:56] to deliver what's desired of the Seeker
[04:31:58] oh
[04:32:00] judging from your expression you don't
[04:32:03] seem to find the idea very agreeable
[04:32:05] don't do it don't do it don't do it
[04:32:08] don't do it since you're the God why are
[04:32:11] you making a deal with the harbinger
[04:32:12] they exchange some knowledge with you
[04:32:16] people exchanging knowledge with the god
[04:32:18] of wisdom is the stuff of Legends yet
[04:32:20] here you wish to exchange knowledge for
[04:32:22] the god of wisdom's property
[04:32:24] arrogant as that is it has piqued my
[04:32:28] interest
[04:32:29] I like you for the time being please
[04:32:31] don't change that
[04:32:33] you've not ever heard the rumor that the
[04:32:36] Skies of Tibet are fake huh
[04:32:41] that's the secret hidden by Urban Soul
[04:32:43] concerning the truth of this world it's
[04:32:47] a conspiracy
[04:32:49] the moon isn't real brother
[04:32:51] Earth is flat I finished telling you

[04:38:02] yes but there are still some residual
[04:38:04] effects the withering is one example
[04:38:06] though it won't spread anymore the
[04:38:09] existing zones won't just disappear we
[04:38:12] forest rangers will still need to do the
[04:38:14] work by the way we have some good news
[04:38:16] Sino got his position back
[04:38:20] this news is hardly new no he had
[04:38:22] already mentioned it to me before
[04:38:28] Gage
[04:38:30] visited once but he was afraid of
[04:38:32] disturbing you while you were resting
[04:38:34] he just asked me a few questions and

[04:38:48] would celebrate Sino he didn't tell you
[04:38:50] hmm
[04:38:52] perhaps or alternatively he doesn't know
[04:38:55] about it either

[04:39:02] celebration feast

[04:39:48] supposedly they were ashamed of their
[04:39:50] shallow ideologies and have decided to
[04:39:53] dedicate the rest of their lives to
[04:39:54] cultivating wisdom in the Avidia Forest
[04:39:57] when they learned that lesser Lord
[04:39:58] kusanali had defeated the balladeer and
[04:40:01] saved Urban Soul they were shocked at
[04:40:03] first but also became happy feeling that
[04:40:06] the sacred light guiding them on the
[04:40:08] path of Discovery until them begun to
[04:40:10] shine once again but is Azar's alive too

[04:46:04] to find a physical book like this in
[04:46:06] sumero
[04:46:07] doesn't matter it's probably just
[04:46:08] another thing that you used your
[04:46:10] authority to get your hands on anyway
[04:46:12] just about it aside okay he is kind of
[04:46:14] hot I'll admit it only to hear that the

[04:46:50] the kasharawar
[04:46:52] besides as a master builder and crap oh
[04:46:56] she's so toxic appointed as a sage too
[04:46:58] hmm
[04:46:59] why do I feel like you don't really mean
[04:47:01] so why is his eyes red
[04:47:04] what makes you say that why would you
[04:47:07] question my heartfelt sincerity maybe
[04:47:10] it's because you've never said anything
[04:47:12] good about me before oh yeah well I
[04:47:15] share a similar sentiment and anyone who
[04:47:17] knows what is this tension you would
[04:47:19] surely do the same
[04:47:21] you
[04:47:23] see this is why I hate discussing
[04:47:26] anything with you ridiculous an arrogant
[04:47:28] attitude always gets in the way
[04:47:31] it seems that you really can't stand my
[04:47:34] personality
[04:47:35] what was your first clue
[04:47:40] well then you might as well move out of
[04:47:42] my house
[04:47:43] are you can I come instead can I move in
[04:47:45] stooping to a new low I see and don't
[04:47:49] change the subject you a sage what a
[04:47:53] joke the Academia might as well just
[04:47:55] close tomorrow are they having a fight
[04:48:01] forget what's going on with the Academia
[04:48:03] haven't you been busy with your
[04:48:05] construction project tell me when are
[04:48:08] you going to build yourself a mansion
[04:48:10] don't get me started
[04:48:12] I get angry just thinking about it
[04:48:15] so what great building did Army
[04:48:19] this time like I need to tell you keep
[04:48:22] your nose out of my business
[04:48:24] no I think we deserve to know where were
[04:48:28] you when sumero needed you most
[04:48:30] I was in the desert for a large project
[04:48:32] but considering haravat's utter
[04:48:34] ignorance of architectural and aesthetic
[04:48:36] matters you probably wouldn't understand
[04:48:39] which is truly unfortunate it doesn't
[04:48:41] have the same earrings as dead or at
[04:48:43] least some will understand the First
[04:48:44] Time beauty and romance unlike a true
[04:48:49] hold on wait a second
[04:48:51] what do you mean by when sumeru needed
[04:48:54] me most well while you were out fiddling
[04:48:57] around in the desert many people came
[04:48:59] together to save sumeru from a crisis
[04:49:02] and you think I'd believe that look
[04:49:06] all you really need to know is that Azar
[04:49:08] and all his accomplices have all been
[04:49:10] overthrown
[04:49:11] huh what nonsense are you talking about
[04:49:16] [ __ ] off my nose if you don't believe
[04:49:18] me it's not like my darshan was the one
[04:49:21] trying to apply for funding from the
[04:49:22] grand Sage
[04:49:23] hmm yours though on the other hand
[04:49:27] you know what I'll ask around I'm sure
[04:49:29] someone knows what's going on here
[04:49:31] you're dead if I find out you're lying
[04:49:33] to me
[04:49:34] [Music]
[04:49:38] um
[04:49:40] then maybe there's Bros chat it's not
[04:49:42] necessarily Gage
[04:49:45] they're both pretty though I agree
[04:49:47] cavi's a bottom it is
[04:49:50] nice it
[04:49:55] [Music]
[04:49:57] oh it's YouTube
[04:49:59] what's the matter
[04:50:00] [Music]
[04:50:02] have you received her letter letter
[04:50:06] that she sent out a letter inviting
[04:50:08] everyone to a celebration feast in two
[04:50:10] days at the Grand Bazaar wait why don't
[04:50:12] we invite cabbie too why are we only
[04:50:14] inviting I'll hide them
[04:50:17] if she addressed the letter to all
[04:50:18] Haytham of the Academia then the letter
[04:50:20] should have gone to my office
[04:50:22] I've been busy these days so I haven't
[04:50:25] had time to check for any new mail it
[04:50:26] didn't help yeah but he's pretty pretty
[04:50:27] I only know who cares about time to
[04:50:29] attend to personal matters haven't you
[04:50:31] heard of pretty privilege
[04:50:34] life isn't fair I'm only busy these days
[04:50:36] because several sages have been
[04:50:38] dismissed recently and the whole
[04:50:39] Academia was practically turned upside
[04:50:41] down
[04:50:42] told us they all went to train in the
[04:50:45] Avidia Forest apparently they will spend
[04:50:47] the rest of their lives there
[04:50:51] that is already the best possible ending
[04:50:53] for the likes of them
[04:50:54] four of the sixth great sages were
[04:50:56] possessed by their desire for power and
[04:50:58] attempted to create a new God
[04:51:00] in order to pull it off they even
[04:51:02] imprisoned the other two rational Sages
[04:51:06] to imagine such things could take place
[04:51:07] in the Academia
[04:51:11] but you're like this what did I do bro
[04:51:15] you
[04:51:17] yes at least that's how they're supposed
[04:51:20] to sound
[04:51:21] it's said that when the Academia was
[04:51:24] first founded the dendro archon herself
[04:51:26] established the six Great Schools each
[04:51:29] representing one of the Cities
[04:51:32] numerous darshans have sprung Up and
[04:51:34] Faded only the six star Sean's attention
[04:51:37] maybe it's gonna talk over cutscenes so
[04:51:40] I don't really listen sometimes I
[04:51:41] usually do but what the [ __ ] is that
[04:51:43] darshan I keep isn't that like a league
[04:51:45] player what the [ __ ] is darshan I'm
[04:51:48] Googling it
[04:51:50] yeah it's a league player
[04:51:55] oh it's School
[04:52:01] that's cool
[04:52:04] I don't know what dude I didn't know
[04:52:06] what it meant in this game bro don't I
[04:52:08] didn't mean to work
[04:52:12] now the six star shots are nearly
[04:52:15] synonymous with the sixth grade schools
[04:52:17] and the leaders selected for the schools
[04:52:19] are the sixth great savings okay he just
[04:52:21] said it
[04:52:22] [Music]
[04:52:24] okay shut up whatever among the sixth
[04:52:27] great sages
[04:52:29] the grand Sage
[04:52:34] and a more to remain now
[04:52:37] they were in prison for opposing a czar
[04:52:39] and were only rescued after Azar's
[04:52:42] downfall
[04:52:48] yes
[04:52:49] normally new sages are selected based on
[04:52:52] a strict set of criteria okay
[04:52:55] to say something about becoming a sage
[04:53:01] yes about that oh
[04:53:04] you didn't let me finish my sentence
[04:53:07] the person in charge of personnel
[04:53:09] Affairs nominated me to be the grand
[04:53:11] sage in place of Azar and help lesser
[04:53:13] Lord kusanali Grand Sage oh he refused
[04:53:16] wait why do you refuse
[04:53:20] I'm not even interested in being one of
[04:53:22] the six great sages like I said before I
[04:53:26] don't like being a leader
[04:53:29] the [ __ ] so are you busy
[04:53:32] guys that's not my job either
[04:53:35] I'm only responsible for handling
[04:53:37] important Affairs within the Academia
[04:53:39] before the new sages take office
[04:53:42] and the first thing I'll do is reject
[04:53:45] kasharawar's application for funding
[04:53:47] them
[04:53:51] is your friend
[04:53:52] do we look like friends what does that
[04:53:55] mean

[04:54:02] my roommate
[04:54:04] you could say he's the representative
[04:54:06] for ksharawar Scholars
[04:54:09] which is exactly why he always has so
[04:54:12] many problems
[04:54:18] thanks for your Hardware is the work of
[04:54:20] the Academia scribe
[04:54:21] anyway no matter how busy you are since
[04:54:24] you are a planner remember to attend the
[04:54:26] celebration feast all right I'll see you

[04:54:43] conversation with Carvey
[04:54:46] we really should I go back

[04:54:54] too late
[04:54:56] [Music]

[04:55:06] yeah

[04:55:42] useless

[04:55:54] part remember I was like locked or like
[04:55:56] the elevator thing you know like there's
[04:55:57] like an elevator that you can't go up I
[04:55:59] wonder if you can
[04:56:00] wait where the [ __ ] is covet
[04:56:06] oh it's unlocked fog
[04:56:08] where the [ __ ] is he
[04:56:18] Papago wait did I see him
[04:56:21] [Music]
[04:56:23] wait let me look at it
[04:56:28] [Music]
[04:56:33] there
[04:56:42] [Music]
[04:56:46] bro
[04:56:52] has gone to the Avidia Forest to reflect
[04:56:54] on himself for the rest of his life and
[04:56:56] those people say they want you to
[04:56:58] replace him as the grand Sage what have
[04:57:01] you done whoa whoa whoa Azar's downfall
[04:57:05] is of his own making what does it have
[04:57:07] to do with me everyone out there is
[04:57:09] saying something different some say Azar
[04:57:12] wanted to create a god While others say
[04:57:14] he wanted to sell his power
[04:57:16] but none of those sound very likely
[04:57:19] if you ask me I think the people
[04:57:21] spreading rumors around here don't have
[04:57:23] access to any real information really oh
[04:57:27] then I'm sure you can use your abilities
[04:57:28] to uncover the treat for yourself but
[04:57:31] he's so sassy
[04:57:32] can't you show just a little respect to
[04:57:34] your senior and explain what's going on
[04:57:37] you were out there all this time and yet
[04:57:39] you still haven't managed to learn a
[04:57:42] single crucial bit of information
[04:57:44] hmm I'm impressed
[04:57:48] fine
[04:57:49] apart from the leaders of amorta and
[04:57:52] bahumana all the sages have been exposed
[04:57:54] and removed as a czar's accomplices
[04:57:57] we need to select new sages for your
[04:57:59] kasharawar darshan as well as my
[04:58:01] heravitate darshan
[04:58:03] what did my darshan collude with Azar as
[04:58:06] well
[04:58:07] wait
[04:58:08] could this be why they sent me out on a
[04:58:10] project oh
[04:58:12] I think that's just a coincidence
[04:58:14] besides whatever you were doing won't
[04:58:17] have any significant impact now or in
[04:58:19] times to come
[04:58:21] you
[04:58:23] listen here I'm not buying any of it
[04:58:26] don't try to use this as an opportunity
[04:58:28] to talk about your crazy theories I
[04:58:31] think there are a few details that
[04:58:33] everyone is overlooking for example how
[04:58:36] as The Scribe You Were Somehow able to
[04:58:39] escape this political crisis completely
[04:58:41] unscathed this can easily be seen as the
[04:58:44] results of a power struggle
[04:58:46] nobody has stopped to point that out yet
[04:58:49] I almost feel like I should go out and
[04:58:51] start telling people about that
[04:58:54] be my guest but I think everybody will
[04:58:57] be more interested in your own
[04:58:58] well-known gaffes
[04:59:00] you know what I am done with you
[04:59:04] um cavities Madge

[05:02:06] what they were doing they're just
[05:02:09] letting everyone make dude first okay
[05:02:12] dude what are they doing first first
[05:02:14] Sino visits tinari instantly then
[05:02:17] cabinet I'll hide them together and now
[05:02:19] these two are walking together what are
[05:02:21] they doing this yeah I might start
[05:02:23] Losing My Edge if I keep being a
[05:02:24] bodyguard for the homayanis you know
[05:02:27] that my parents and I are fond of you
[05:02:29] and we appreciate you very much they
[05:02:32] know what they're doing be a problem
[05:02:34] they're feeding the artists
[05:02:37] I'm not a woman that's easily persuaded
[05:02:40] you should know that by now my lady when
[05:02:43] I took this job I had already decided
[05:02:45] that I'd quit as soon as you'd recovered
[05:02:47] it's time for me to get back out there
[05:02:49] and Chase that Horizon
[05:02:53] art anymore I want to take a risky job
[05:02:57] and put my body to the test again
[05:03:01] I know if I hadn't joined in that plan
[05:03:04] with you it wouldn't have come up with
[05:03:06] it what are you gonna do bro just to
[05:03:08] relax I guess I still get fired up by
[05:03:10] that feeling of going all out in a fight
[05:03:12] it made me realize that I'm still a
[05:03:15] mercenary through and through
[05:03:17] life is short and I'm happy that I got
[05:03:20] to be a part of that operation
[05:03:22] but the whole thing also made me realize
[05:03:24] that there are still many problems in
[05:03:26] sumeru and as a desert dweller I'm still
[05:03:29] not completely ready to settle down on
[05:03:31] this side of the wall
[05:03:32] well I remember a friend had someone
[05:03:35] bring you a message you mean I'll hate
[05:03:38] them I didn't expect him to still
[05:03:40] remember that I thought he was joking we
[05:03:43] just came from Talking did he tell you
[05:03:45] that he suggested that I come work at
[05:03:47] the Academia what
[05:03:50] I heard that Azar and his cronies fell
[05:03:52] from power and all hate them told me
[05:03:54] that now was a good time to find a job
[05:03:56] in the Academia true
[05:04:00] anything other than a mercenary
[05:04:02] me neither
[05:04:05] would look great dressed up as a
[05:04:11] seconds in there
[05:04:13] I'll hate them probably just like the
[05:04:14] way I worked he didn't know it she just
[05:04:17] says that so he suggested I find some
[05:04:18] work in the Academia dude
[05:04:22] what is happening
[05:04:31] the matcha have all the talent they need
[05:04:33] as long as they have Sino I prefer to be
[05:04:35] free to live however I choose in fact I
[05:04:38] chose this job from the very start
[05:04:40] because I knew it'd be right up my alley
[05:04:42] even if being a mercenary means facing
[05:04:44] all kinds of danger a lion has to return
[05:04:47] to the wild sooner or later if anything
[05:04:49] being your bodyguard has been unfamiliar
[05:04:52] territory for me I don't want to see you
[05:04:55] go but I'll respect your decision I'm
[05:04:58] glad to hear you say that come on no
[05:05:01] need for the sad face it's not like
[05:05:03] we'll never meet again fudge once the
[05:05:05] whole dendro archon thing is settled
[05:05:07] everything in sumeru will take a turn
[05:05:09] but a peaceful Society will probably
[05:05:11] mean less demand for Mercenaries like me
[05:05:13] before long will be a Dying Breed so I'd
[05:05:17] better get to work while I still can
[05:05:25] well no not yet at least
[05:05:27] I promised my lady I'd stick around
[05:05:29] until next week
[05:05:31] so have you been more almost this entire
[05:05:34] time we were wondering if you had
[05:05:36] received a letter from yumu oh sharing
[05:05:39] that you were seen in poor oremos so she
[05:05:41] said it was probably sent my lady has
[05:05:43] been very energetic lately oh my god did

[05:15:23] thanks I'm glad to hear it and I'm happy
[05:15:27] to meet everyone that participated in
[05:15:29] the great plan don't mention it come to
[05:15:31] think of it we've really done something
[05:15:33] impressive together we owe it to our
[05:15:35] abilities and luck really why do I
[05:15:39] remember everybody thinking that luck
[05:15:41] was against us and feeling like we
[05:15:43] hardly had a chance of succeeding that's
[05:15:45] how I remember it too it's luck that
[05:15:47] brought us together and it was wait is
[05:15:49] are we just gonna gloss past the fact
[05:15:51] that nahida just ripped Bozo gave gave
[05:15:53] away two [ __ ] no plans
[05:15:58] they're just gonna move past that that
[05:16:00] she just gave it for a conspiracy theory
[05:16:04] okay moreover judging from the results
[05:16:07] everything worked out well yeah everyone
[05:16:11] gave it their all when it mattered most
[05:16:13] but this guy's fake brother I hear the
[05:16:16] gnosis
[05:16:20] we took this everyone played their part
[05:16:22] and thanks to everyone's efforts the
[05:16:25] performance was a great success so would
[05:16:29] you say we're good actors too it's such
[05:16:32] a blessing that unless I Learned
[05:16:33] kusanali was able to return to power at
[05:16:35] the Academia
[05:16:38] yes even after being abandoned and
[05:16:41] neglected so many times she's finally
[05:16:44] returned
[05:16:45] uh-huh lesser Lord cousin Ali once
[05:16:48] seized all her power in a great disaster
[05:16:49] which resulted in her losing all her
[05:16:51] wisdom and memories of the past
[05:16:53] wait I have a question yeah basically
[05:16:56] abandoned her because of it
[05:17:00] okay so if okay no one remembers greater
[05:17:03] Lord kusanali or whatever or whatever
[05:17:05] that Ruka Nevada whatever the [ __ ] okay
[05:17:06] no one remembers the greater Lord one
[05:17:07] right sure
[05:17:09] then why is the second one called lesser
[05:17:11] Lord lesser to whom why is her title
[05:17:15] lesser Lord if there's no greater Lord
[05:17:21] if everyone forgot about the greater
[05:17:23] Lord why is there a lesser Lord
[05:17:27] [Music]
[05:17:30] and it's a Chinese term in Chinese it's
[05:17:33] little Lord okay but what about big Lord
[05:17:36] I guess because she's small whatever
[05:17:41] still though it's kind of sauce that's
[05:17:42] kind of sauce I'm on to you I'm on to
[05:17:45] you
[05:17:46] this should be something everybody
[05:17:48] should remember
[05:17:51] you look surprised wait so what if what
[05:17:54] if Lou means like did I
[05:17:56] yeah there used to be a greater Lord
[05:17:58] does she just get elizar back that'd be
[05:18:00] pretty funny I mean that wouldn't be
[05:18:02] funny but it'd be pretty funny
[05:18:05] what happened did she just get it back
[05:18:07] it's just like you know what Kali [ __ ]
[05:18:09] you just no no everything you said is
[05:18:13] correct
[05:18:14] something wrong
[05:18:16] what's with that face
[05:18:21] even if those two giants of the Academia
[05:18:24] are here I still have to say it
[05:18:26] [Music]
[05:18:29] those sages really have some nerve 500
[05:18:32] years ago lesser Lord kusanali used all
[05:18:34] her power for the people of sumeru very
[05:18:36] lesser can indicate either size or
[05:18:38] relative power and okay that makes sense
[05:18:45] see that everyone forgot about who
[05:18:48] their understanding of sumo's History
[05:18:50] was also changed
[05:18:57] um
[05:19:03] wait Chad do you guys think so do what
[05:19:06] do you guys think what's his name do you
[05:19:07] think danesleaf knows surely right
[05:19:09] because he's not from this world
[05:19:11] I think when we talked to Dane's Leaf he
[05:19:12] knows
[05:19:14] because he's like a void God
[05:19:17] destroyer of worlds I don't actually
[05:19:19] know what the what he is he's from this
[05:19:21] world whatever but does he know or is he
[05:19:23] just dumb but isn't he like the lore man
[05:19:27] he is from this world okay whatever I
[05:19:29] thought he was like I thought he was
[05:19:30] like a bit above the world you know like
[05:19:33] not in the world but like
[05:19:34] I thought dude he's like the voice of
[05:19:36] the trailer I thought he would know I
[05:19:38] guess he doesn't
[05:19:42] um so it's only us
[05:19:55] what if we told the fatoui and then we
[05:19:57] sided with them oh what if our brother
[05:20:00] knows because he's not from this world
[05:20:01] and then he tells the fatoui
[05:20:04] and then GG elizar if you bite the hand
[05:20:06] that feeds you don't act surprised when
[05:20:08] it turns into a knuckle sandwich right
[05:20:10] Sino
[05:20:12] perhaps I shouldn't say this but their
[05:20:15] treatment of lesser Lord kusanali calls
[05:20:17] for a more severe punishment you could
[05:20:20] simply tell lesser Lord kusanali that
[05:20:22] you wish to have a czar in his
[05:20:23] accomplices severely punished I don't
[05:20:26] know why there's too many clueless says
[05:20:28] so shut up
[05:20:29] in any way
[05:20:31] while we're on this topic until I'm done
[05:20:33] the quest when I'm done quotation to
[05:20:36] become the grand Sage are you trying to
[05:20:38] say that I'm fit to be a sage
[05:20:40] not at all
[05:20:42] but every person handling this election
[05:20:44] process has said that you are the most
[05:20:47] suitable candidate to lead the Academia
[05:20:49] right now why because
[05:20:51] Throne desire from Power
[05:20:54] could you try to put it in another way
[05:20:57] this is a good thing yet you're making
[05:20:59] it sound like I overthrew a czar for my
[05:21:01] own personal gain but seriously though I
[05:21:04] always wondered if you had some personal
[05:21:06] motives behind it I did have my own
[05:21:08] motive but it had nothing to do with
[05:21:10] being a sage if the rules of our nation
[05:21:13] were suddenly cast by the wayside then
[05:21:15] it wouldn't be long until chaos ensued
[05:21:18] I had no intention of letting their
[05:21:20] dreams disrupt my life by that you mean
[05:21:23] your life working as the academius
[05:21:24] Scribe precisely wait is that all so
[05:21:29] that's the only reason why you joined it
[05:21:31] yeah that's pretty funny there's plans
[05:21:33] it's reasoning you've certainly got
[05:21:36] quite the personality she's like I don't
[05:21:38] want to be influenced by your dreams
[05:21:39] time to overthrow the government how
[05:21:41] about you you've already resumed work as
[05:21:43] the general mahamatra right that's right
[05:21:46] will you be happy with that life it's
[05:21:49] not about being happy
[05:21:51] okay there are merely a lot of things
[05:21:53] all good though even so
[05:21:58] yeah base new
[05:22:03] thank you
[05:22:05] I'll keep that in mind
[05:22:07] [Music]
[05:22:08] um
[05:22:12] I have to talk to everyone again
[05:22:15] it's upside down the atmosphere here is
[05:22:17] good
[05:22:18] and everything is delicious
[05:22:21] yeah I don't often come to such places I
[05:22:24] have a lot to handle these days

[05:24:10] quite good no
[05:24:12] this Gathering today has a unique
[05:24:14] meaning the Grand Bazaar is Lively
[05:24:17] because the people here feel happiness
[05:24:19] from the bottom of their hearts unlike
[05:24:21] the farces at the Academia
[05:24:24] that happiness is an emotion that'll be
[05:24:26] forever alien to those bookworms who
[05:24:28] have driven themselves insane by
[05:24:30] studying hmm

[05:25:42] connection with you a connection between

[05:26:11] doctor you know what happened
[05:26:14] to everyone for me

[05:26:24] for me
[05:26:27] oh

[05:26:30] people will become all quiet and stiff

[05:26:56] because the Academia
[05:26:59] because I thought if there wasn't a god

[05:28:08] with the consciousness of lesser Lord

[05:32:53] there is still some Mysteries left in
[05:32:56] him
[05:32:57] some things may be very clear from my
[05:32:59] perspective but he is still yet to
[05:33:02] understand them himself
[05:33:03] his future will be determined by Fate
[05:33:10] and bust uh what happened when I fell
[05:33:13] asleep
[05:33:16] nahida I like you right now if you gave
[05:33:19] him two [ __ ] Yoshis I swear for a

[05:33:34] and we're gonna have to go fight a
[05:33:35] [ __ ] newborn God made by the Torre
[05:33:38] thank you
[05:33:40] exactly
[05:33:43] harbingers uh number three possess power
[05:33:47] comparable to that of gods hey October
[05:33:50] Theory who's three so one is piano two
[05:33:51] is the Tory who's three who's three you
[05:33:54] know
[05:33:55] Pierro the Tori who
[05:33:57] columbina
[05:33:59] wait really I think colombino was that
[05:34:00] high up
[05:34:02] isn't she the girl that's just badge
[05:34:05] doesn't she just [ __ ]
[05:34:08] I guess I'll see
[05:34:09] [Music]
[05:34:11] that's what child said too oh yeah I
[05:34:13] remember actually
[05:34:15] he sings
[05:34:22] however in spite of the bad situation
[05:34:26] it's fair deal clueless it was fair
[05:34:29] surely he won't just clone himself again
[05:34:31] surely he can't just make more clones
[05:34:36] change
[05:34:37] your heavenly Prince
[05:34:41] principles has been quiet since the
[05:34:43] Conrad disaster 500 years ago
[05:34:46] I use this point as leverage against the
[05:34:48] doctor
[05:34:50] I told him that the Heavenly principles
[05:34:52] may be awakened if I destroy the nurses
[05:34:55] although it was just a bluff he still
[05:34:58] fell for it I assume that the Heavenly
[05:35:00] principles wouldn't just stand by and
[05:35:03] let such extensive damage to its laws
[05:35:05] take place
[05:35:07] yeah he said it was hard he said you're
[05:35:10] ahead for now but not like long term
[05:35:11] you're just gonna make the Clones again
[05:35:13] it just takes more materials but the
[05:35:14] more power he has the easier it is to
[05:35:16] get more materials so like
[05:35:20] and as for what they exchanged for the
[05:35:23] noses
[05:35:24] Wait no that's plural The Exchange
[05:35:27] served as both punishment for the doctor
[05:35:29] as well as a boon of new knowledge that
[05:35:32] I couldn't refuse it wasn't you know
[05:35:33] you're the conspiracy man he just said
[05:35:36] the moon's made of cheese vaccines
[05:35:37] aren't real and you believed them
[05:35:43] I'm done about the Akasha
[05:35:46] events the Akasha can no longer function
[05:35:48] as it used to
[05:35:51] I've given
[05:35:54] that decided to shut it down permanently
[05:35:57] but this is definitely not a bad thing
[05:36:00] even from the beginning I've been put
[05:36:02] the a cautious centralized
[05:36:03] administration of knowledge I'm sure it
[05:36:06] was worth it trailer will learn about
[05:36:07] the sky the number of paths available to
[05:36:10] them
[05:36:12] sumero although people may initially
[05:36:15] feel a little uncomfortable with the
[05:36:16] loss of the Akasha they will soon
[05:36:19] understand that this life is more
[05:36:21] suitable for them and as for the future
[05:36:24] of samaru
[05:36:25] in preparing to regain control of the
[05:36:28] Academia the former sages have received
[05:36:30] their punishment but the new sages have
[05:36:33] yet to be selected Chad deletes the
[05:36:36] internet
[05:36:37] I hope that the new six great sages will
[05:36:40] be more focused on academics Samira
[05:36:43] needs such leaders more than ever
[05:36:45] the other big issue is the people of
[05:36:48] King deshrit I feel bad for scar dude
[05:36:50] why are they so easy to beat it was like
[05:36:52] this whole thing of making a god they
[05:36:54] were just like beat him in like two
[05:36:55] seconds and then the tour is like yeah
[05:36:57] he's just an experiment like whatever
[05:37:00] it's like I okay
[05:37:05] it was incomplete I know but like yeah I
[05:37:08] feel bad taking some measures to address
[05:37:10] this
[05:37:12] it will take some time to rebuild every
[05:37:15] there if it's culture friendship or
[05:37:17] trust we will rebuild it
[05:37:23] all right about Fountain is that where
[05:37:25] that we're headed next Fontaine the
[05:37:27] nation of Justice yeah it's just gonna
[05:37:28] take like a year because we're waiting
[05:37:30] for the patch
[05:37:33] a nation of Justice
[05:37:37] oh God French law dies of cringe can't
[05:37:40] wait to studyville
[05:37:43] all right whatever
[05:37:46] does their archon personally judge
[05:37:48] people
[05:37:51] no there's a chief justice in Fontaine
[05:37:55] generally speaking at all what decide
[05:37:59] over individual trials
[05:38:10] huh
[05:38:16] folklore
[05:38:17] folklore [ __ ] at all
[05:38:21] yeah that's probably that however
[05:38:23] even then false alarm will still make
[05:38:26] fossil or what the [ __ ] fuss at all
[05:38:29] that's not a word
[05:38:30] immerse yourself and
[05:38:34] Todd Ari brother
[05:38:37] she still reserves the right to
[05:38:39] influence the final verdict
[05:38:41] wait so it's like the
[05:38:43] she's like uh she has like the egg is
[05:38:45] she has like the veto she's like the
[05:38:48] president
[05:38:49] anyway let's just say she's got uh a
[05:38:54] very unique person it's really fun so
[05:38:56] long in French wait there's a CCD
[05:38:58] there's like a little thing on the sea
[05:39:00] so it's actually first at all wait
[05:39:01] that's a cringe though [ __ ] out all is
[05:39:03] better was it fuss at all
[05:39:07] why is there a ccg whatever
[05:39:18] damn that's it
[05:39:20] are you sure
[05:39:21] isn't there something else you haven't
[05:39:23] asked about yet
[05:39:26] huh about your brother why is this so
[05:39:29] zoomed in dude why are you so he does
[05:39:32] the most cursed archon why does it keep
[05:39:34] doing it it's like the child cursed meme
[05:39:36] I think he's there with your face
[05:39:38] I took some time to perform an Urban
[05:39:40] Soul search for information on your
[05:39:42] brother
[05:39:43] we both Came From Beyond to see the star
[05:39:45] there should be information on their own
[05:39:46] soul
[05:39:48] [Music]
[05:39:55] and D does not have any information on
[05:39:58] you
[05:39:59] however there must be something
[05:40:01] different about your brother
[05:40:04] because as it turns out the world has
[05:40:07] recorded information on him after all
[05:40:12] what
[05:40:14] there's only one possible explanation he
[05:40:18] belongs to this world okay stop looking
[05:40:20] for him Settle Down live a nice life
[05:40:22] with like Daya or I'll hide them or
[05:40:25] anyone you met along the way go back
[05:40:26] dude it's fine [ __ ] your brother no one
[05:40:28] cares about him live a life
[05:40:33] isn't Channel like in love with the
[05:40:35] traveler and shall just go like live
[05:40:37] with one of them
[05:40:45] wasn't this your first trip to Tibet
[05:40:51] according to the records I was able to
[05:40:54] access
[05:40:55] your sibling suddenly appeared in
[05:40:57] congria after the Conrad disaster he
[05:41:01] began his journey through the Seven
[05:41:02] Nations of Tibet
[05:41:05] but Justice's Journey was about to reach
[05:41:07] its conclusion
[05:41:08] there are mental records on him suddenly
[05:41:11] become fuzzy
[05:41:13] you know what's funny
[05:41:15] I just realized how the voice actors are
[05:41:17] gonna have to say this entire like essay
[05:41:19] of dialogue and then say it again but
[05:41:22] change all the heat to her
[05:41:24] just because it can be either what do
[05:41:26] you mean
[05:41:32] since only they can know is deliberately
[05:41:35] obfuscating his fate and whoever it is
[05:41:39] if they can do that
[05:41:41] who knows what else they're capable of
[05:41:43] dude imagine they just okay imagine they
[05:41:45] made them record it all with like like
[05:41:47] let's say she and then they made the
[05:41:48] voice actual record just he and then
[05:41:50] every time there's a sentence they'll
[05:41:52] just replace the she with he and then
[05:41:54] it'd be super Scouts that'd be funny
[05:41:55] good take
[05:42:05] the fatoui have not classified your
[05:42:08] sibling as one of the descenders what's
[05:42:10] a Defender
[05:42:12] look I'm sure you must be curious about
[05:42:15] the information oh you're literally just
[05:42:17] gonna say it in return I'm listening
[05:42:19] this better be [ __ ] worth it a very
[05:42:21] important part of the intel was about
[05:42:23] this world's descenders external beings
[05:42:26] ones that don't belong to this world
[05:42:28] okay traveler you are to that's fourth
[05:42:32] Defender
[05:42:35] wait what
[05:42:37] hi so the patui count three other
[05:42:40] descenders before the traveler and her
[05:42:42] brother isn't even one of them
[05:42:45] that's right my current hypothesis is
[05:42:48] that the first Ascender was likely what
[05:42:51] we now call the Heavenly principles as
[05:42:53] for the other descenders I still need to
[05:42:56] verify their existence it could take me
[05:42:59] some time
[05:43:00] huh
[05:43:02] and yet even knowing all this
[05:43:06] I'm sure you must still have a lot of
[05:43:08] unanswered questions okay I'm not gonna
[05:43:10] lie I would rather not know this
[05:43:12] information and the Tory not possess a
[05:43:14] dendro narcissus but that's just me also
[05:43:17] we have 20 minutes before the day reset
[05:43:19] and I need to refresh resin so uh hurry
[05:43:21] wrap it up nahida wrap it up
[05:43:25] the give Eloy Lord
[05:43:27] actually
[05:43:33] yeah the Tori could have taken it
[05:43:35] forcefully but he offered an exchange I
[05:43:37] feel like the exchange is kind of troll
[05:43:42] no okay
[05:43:45] [Music]
[05:43:50] I'll also begin your journey in you and
[05:43:53] depart from Samara
[05:43:59] I'm very interested in your future if
[05:44:01] fate is the ultimate knowledge then your
[05:44:04] future will be the ultimate fate
[05:44:06] okay I know by the way I know at the end
[05:44:09] of genchin when everyone here is either
[05:44:11] either quit the game or is like 35 and
[05:44:13] has like six jobs 10 kids but it's still
[05:44:16] logging in every day to claim their
[05:44:17] welcome and do a single pull when they
[05:44:19] get AR 70 for one single pull I know
[05:44:22] okay and we're still stuck at Abyss 12
[05:44:23] because there's nothing okay but point
[05:44:25] is I feel like after we explore all
[05:44:27] seven regions we're probably you know
[05:44:29] we're probably going back to monstat at
[05:44:30] the end probably because that makes
[05:44:31] sense but dude imagine if you could pick
[05:44:33] the region to go back to you're like you
[05:44:34] know what final region I go where I want
[05:44:36] and then we go see nahida because she's
[05:44:38] actually a good archon but no instead of
[05:44:39] going back to [ __ ] monstad with no
[05:44:42] I'm sorry I'm sure glad we got to meet
[05:44:45] you nahida why monster because there's a
[05:44:48] lot of Unfinished plot storiesness over
[05:44:51] there and also I don't know it just
[05:44:53] makes sense I feel like pleasure is all
