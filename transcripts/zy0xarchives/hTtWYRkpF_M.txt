[01:05:44] time you pull on any Banner you lose the
[01:05:46] 50-50 and then you think back to this
[01:05:48] moment and then you think okay you know

[01:05:52] be nice to people in the future then you
[01:05:54] come to my chat and you're nice to me
[01:05:55] and and then you get the character you
[01:05:56] want and all is well until the next time
[01:05:58] you pull and you lose your 50/50 again
[01:06:00] because one loss wasn't enough for the
[01:06:01] damage you did and then you'll be like

[02:02:49] almost back home for something that I
[02:02:50] can't say what yet but it'll be cool
[02:02:52] when it's out for now uh we're going to
[02:02:54] do some fourar clears in the new Abyss
[02:02:56] okay uh we're going to play I was
[02:02:58] thinking about this I think we played
[02:02:59] 168 we play four teams
[02:03:01] 1618 hyper Bloom with kie sucros no
[02:03:05] sorry either official sucros or kie
[02:03:08] whatever
[02:03:10] aggravate and then either Shang Ling or
[02:03:12] like Yen or something we're going to
[02:03:15] start with the easiest teams which is
[02:03:17] 1618 because it's absolutely broken is
[02:03:19] faking boners Rosaria
[02:03:22] Ka CH can you type 1618 so I know what
[02:03:24] order this is rosar K Shang Bennett
[02:03:26] thank you uh and then first half we're
[02:03:28] going to play
[02:03:31] um probably aggravate I think oh no but
[02:03:34] this is cryo I mean it doesn't matter we
[02:03:36] can break
[02:03:42] it honestly dude this Abyss is so
[02:03:45] [ __ ] pyo
[02:03:48] propaganda I guess we could play like an
[02:03:50] usia is Lynette [ __ ] Lucia can
[02:03:52] Lynette work here I kind of don't want
[02:03:54] to though Lynette can wait maybe we do
[02:03:56] play Lynette
[02:04:03] Bots yep yes yep yes maybe we do I mean
[02:04:08] I don't know if it's better than just
[02:04:09] like force breaking it with sucros
[02:04:11] but probably not honestly it's probably
[02:04:15] not better than just official
[02:04:17] sucros maybe though
[02:04:26] oh
[02:04:29] [Music]
[02:04:41] yeah it is way faster yeah but you lose
[02:04:44] damage that way so I don't know if it's
[02:04:46] like actually better overall
[02:04:52] I need background music while I
[02:04:55] think
[02:04:59] um my L is honestly not geared but I
[02:05:03] don't think it matters I think we
[02:05:04] probably do I mean I could just do
[02:05:07] aggravate like this seems pretty
[02:05:10] good not cooky
[02:05:30] the only thing is if I'm playing this
[02:05:31] team then I might as well use SRO first
[02:05:33] half and then when I use syro second
[02:05:35] half I can play this team thoughts okay
[02:05:36] okay I agree I just agreed with myself
[02:05:38] agreed we're GNA do
[02:05:42] this zingu yao yao a bit slow on the
[02:05:46] dendra op but we should be
[02:05:50] fine right we're definitely fine
[02:05:56] here actually beta might be better
[02:06:11] no honestly we might did aggravate I
[02:06:14] feel like aggravate still better I feel
[02:06:15] like SRO is not nearly as good here as
[02:06:20] bet okay yeah we're doing bet [ __ ] it
[02:06:23] [ __ ]
[02:06:31] it wait actually what if we just did
[02:06:34] this [ __ ] dendro
[02:06:38] thoughts what if we just tasered
[02:06:40] it wait
[02:06:45] thoughts all right I'm doing taser I'm
[02:06:48] playing taser you can't stop
[02:06:50] me we don't need dendro propaganda [ __ ]

[02:06:55] we're playing these teams boom let's go
[02:06:57] we're on fourstar weapons on every
[02:06:58] single character by the way I made sure
[02:06:59] before we started we we have no the only
[02:07:01] battle pass weapon we have is on BET
[02:07:03] Serpent's fine cuz I don't feel like
[02:07:04] changing it no one else has
[02:07:11] one a lot less damage in chamber two but
[02:07:14] that's but sure I mean that's fine we
[02:07:16] have a we have a claymore and FAL to
[02:07:17] break cryo we'll be
[02:07:19] fine it's honestly not that much worried
[02:07:21] okay it is worse cuz it's worse than the
[02:07:23] hyper Bloom team but compared to
[02:07:24] aggravate we have Sr so it
[02:07:26] helps I don't know we'll

[02:23:18] Up honestly this is good as long as our
[02:23:20] damage is Nothing Else Matters we have
[02:23:21] enough energy cuz we're killing them
[02:23:22] really fast okay this is
[02:23:26] good boom
[02:23:30] boom boom do you think I meant the
[02:23:32] [ __ ] SW fine kill this guy
[02:23:36] boom okay so far so good not the best
[02:23:39] grouping but it's
[02:23:42] okay
[02:23:45] okay I'm going to do this cuz I don't
[02:23:47] want to like Dash behind them and [ __ ]
[02:23:48] up my burst do this trying to group them
[02:23:52] FR light it up no wrong character I
[02:23:56] don't know if I snapshotted I don't know
[02:23:57] if I was in bed burst my it's fine
[02:23:59] though as long as we break the shield it
[02:24:00] doesn't matter if our damages oh I
[02:24:02] grouped them I didn't group them I
[02:24:04] didn't group them I didn't group them I
[02:24:05] didn't group them oh my God I might have
[02:24:08] to reset I didn't group them
