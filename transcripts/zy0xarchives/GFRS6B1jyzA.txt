[00:01:19] wonderful wait should I skip this or no
[00:01:20] drowning man forgot about everything all
[00:01:23] right are we listening are we skipping
[00:01:24] why is there a pull of if I should do a
[00:01:26] cooking stream I was gonna pull if I
[00:01:28] should listen or skip perhaps there was
[00:01:29] an adeptical power at work in that music
[00:01:31] that he as a mortal could not perceive
[00:01:35] okay let me change the poll one sec let
[00:01:37] me pause this let me pause it let me

[00:02:06] is true increase dialogue volume I will
[00:02:08] run after this after this little
[00:02:09] increase
[00:02:11] but this story is all the way from
[00:02:12] Fontaine
[00:02:14] it's a bit of also highlights really
[00:02:16] also we're skipping every time on
[00:02:18] dialogue I don't care I
[00:02:21] it's nothing against pymon or like the
[00:02:23] The Voice there's nothing against that

[00:17:05] seats around the lost oh thus like God
[00:17:09] of the Dead okay that's pretty cool then

[00:17:12] it does that's cool if by dust is like
[00:17:14] God of the Dead like the dust then
[00:17:16] that's cool but if it's just like

[00:17:46] bad
[00:17:47] I don't know I didn't notice the
[00:17:48] spoilers I thought it was like from the
[00:17:49] manga my bad my bad my bad my bad I
[00:17:53] close the top I close the topic actually
[00:17:54] I did now I closed it now I closed it
[00:17:55] though usually a mild-mannered fellow I
[00:17:58] didn't know this one I thought it was
[00:18:00] like from the manga like when people saw
[00:18:01] notori with other masks to show them off
[00:18:04] I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:18:07] okay I don't remember his name so that's
[00:18:11] what seagazer was like he was an old
[00:18:14] friend and a former rival one has many
[00:18:18] memories of him okay cool once he had
[00:18:21] brought out the treasure it would
[00:18:23] predictably become the center of
[00:18:25] attention neither Guai Zhang nor one was
[00:18:28] content spotlight
[00:18:31] so we would then also present our
[00:18:34] proudest mechanical creations
[00:18:36] as adeptide we were each gifted in our
[00:18:39] own way I just wanted to make fun of a
[00:18:41] character and I regret it respective
[00:18:44] fields of expertise
[00:18:46] as a result one often quarreled with sea
[00:18:49] gazer okay his treasures were not even
[00:18:52] of his own making he just used his
[00:18:55] exploration skills to dig them out of
[00:18:57] the ground
[00:18:58] how pray tell could he compare to me
[00:19:00] when every single one of one's
[00:19:02] accomplishments were crafted by one's
[00:19:04] own hand the cloud retainer's ego is
[00:19:07] insane container you are getting
[00:19:08] competitive again
[00:19:11] one digresses
[00:19:13] regardless every time an argument
[00:19:15] occurred Guai Zhang would come over to
[00:19:18] watch us during our mutual lambastics
[00:19:21] what the [ __ ] is a lambasting I'm
[00:19:23] Googling that she would join in
[00:19:25] lambasting she'd take one of us by the
[00:19:28] limb a harsh criticism ridiculous
[00:19:31] nonsense
[00:19:33] oh yes indeed a lambasting oh ravenous
[00:19:36] no kind of nonsense were we marvelous
[00:19:39] sometimes she would brazenly opine ah
[00:19:43] Why argue between yourselves when
[00:19:46] neither of you could ever hope to beat
[00:19:48] me many times she would make unsolicited
[00:19:51] suggestions such as once you two are
[00:19:54] done arguing let's go to the foot of the
[00:19:57] mountain and Grill some meat
[00:20:00] she always sought to make everyone happy
[00:20:02] and one must say she had quite the gift
[00:20:05] for it no matter what nonsense she said
[00:20:09] one never felt bothered or offended that
[00:20:12] I love meat it also helped that she
[00:20:13] never referred to one as that
[00:20:16] illuminated bird or ladybird dude what
[00:20:19] is with their ego
[00:20:21] knowing she's pissed about the ego I'm
[00:20:23] sorry I called you illuminated bird
[00:20:29] anyway just as our impassioned arguments
[00:20:32] which is a God to be fair okay and we're
[00:20:35] a god Slayer Lou means literally
[00:20:36] stronger than you rip bozo
[00:20:40] who would dare snub the stove God and
[00:20:43] His wondrous creations
[00:20:46] at the sight of him we would all
[00:20:48] immediately drop the argument and
[00:20:50] prepare the table for a night of
[00:20:52] feasting and drinking
[00:20:54] okay
[00:20:56] back then one was always bothered by how
[00:20:59] the Cup's Rex lapis brought we're always
[00:21:02] too Square for one step yeah seems like
[00:21:04] the type to bring a square cup to a
[00:21:06] party enjoying a drink from a square cup
[00:21:10] precisely so as you can see even one as
[00:21:15] great as Reckless not immune to making
[00:21:18] the occasional blunder even one could
[00:21:21] never find fault with marchosis cooking
[00:21:23] this March we ate I'm not gonna google
[00:21:26] it I'm not gonna google it it's fine
[00:21:28] conversation sure
[00:21:31] old
[00:21:31] fossils
[00:21:33] that's kind of toxic
[00:21:35] from a spot high in the mountain it's
[00:21:37] Global oh I didn't know that was his
[00:21:39] other names
[00:21:45] street Wood Rambler within remained to
[00:21:48] admire the flowers with guaijan we
[00:21:50] before returning to her own abode
[00:21:53] the streetward Rambler that would be
[00:21:56] ping ping I probably know her as Madame
[00:21:59] can we get the Ping Banner
[00:22:01] okay
[00:22:02] wait this is a lovely store are you
[00:22:05] saying that it was great a loss long has
[00:22:09] one avoided this place for precisely
[00:22:11] that reason
[00:22:13] the sights here are a reminder of a Time
[00:22:16] long gone
[00:22:18] okay one should have guessed that you
[00:22:19] would disrupt one's poignant moment of
[00:22:22] mourning with your incessant questioning
[00:22:24] no matter one will share the whole story
[00:22:27] with you now
[00:22:29] what's happening
[00:22:30] in time's gone by one quarreled offed
[00:22:33] with guaijong concerning mechanical
[00:22:35] principles we each had our ideals and
[00:22:38] neither would yield
[00:22:40] under the pretext of social Gathering
[00:22:42] one invited the Empire that's the one
[00:22:44] that we saw right to judge the quality
[00:22:46] of our creations
[00:22:48] but Rex lapis declared that guaijan's
[00:22:51] obscuro vopus mechanism was Superior
[00:22:53] she's pretty cute
[00:22:56] okay from the back I thought it was Shao
[00:22:59] with long hair because it was like okay
[00:23:01] is that cloud retainers
[00:23:05] as for the story between dude she's tall
[00:23:08] and has green hair those are child
[00:23:10] characteristics
[00:23:13] opinion while mechanisms were no such
[00:23:16] she's cute too
[00:23:17] they were yet capable of producing
[00:23:20] simple but fine melodies
[00:23:23] streetward Rambler believe
[00:23:26] D Russian of the Soul an emotional
[00:23:29] enterprise wait for hope to be
[00:23:31] replicated by Machinery but was that
[00:23:33] ping they argued endlessly until one ass
[00:23:37] threats lapist intercede he confiscated
[00:23:40] the bell and designated it for
[00:23:41] ceremonial use
[00:23:50] okay that is very Gage
[00:23:53] that is ex there's nothing wrong with
[00:23:55] that I'm just saying it's extremely like
[00:23:57] my Spidey senses
[00:23:59] war broke out between the guards
[00:24:01] honestly good for them planes
[00:24:05] Zhang was overpowered by the enemy
[00:24:10] when I arrived at this this tree would
[00:24:12] Rambler
[00:24:13] all that remained among the ruins dear
[00:24:16] lifeless body
[00:24:18] after this oh it is Ping okay rambler's
[00:24:21] request Rex lapis grunted her well they
[00:24:24] said that my bad my bad they said that
[00:24:25] my bad I'm sorry I'm
[00:24:28] not listening
[00:24:31] [Music]
[00:24:36] many Lantern rides have passed and sun
[00:24:40] money greetings and goodbyes
[00:24:44] [Music]
[00:24:46] okay
[00:24:47] ly planes
[00:24:50] no
[00:24:52] it's
[00:24:53] everything
[00:24:57] White Castle White Castle human life is
[00:25:01] like a lantern that's
[00:25:03] split one minute and extinguish the next
[00:25:06] um
[00:25:07] we adapt I so different
[00:25:09] perhaps as dust settles after a storm we
[00:25:13] too must one day return to the world
[00:25:16] below
[00:25:19] Dan what the [ __ ] has always been
[00:25:22] austere
[00:25:25] [Music]
[00:25:32] okay okay what
[00:25:35] yeah that I can choose how they look
[00:25:37] which is why Xiao decided to be a
[00:25:39] colossal Mammoth of a man now that
[00:25:41] argument halters in two ways first of
[00:25:43] all Charlotte's tall second of all even
[00:25:45] if he wasn't all let's say
[00:25:47] hypothetically shower to be short what
[00:25:49] is wrong with that maybe he chose
[00:25:50] hypothetically to be short despite him
[00:25:52] being tall to show that hey the height
[00:25:56] isn't everything okay it's not
[00:25:58] everything it's not just about oh
[00:26:00] congratulations you're tall but it's
[00:26:02] about the person at hand what
[00:26:05] but he's tall obviously chatty just
[00:26:09] because one is I feel like I missed a
[00:26:11] lot of not cut scenes like I kind of got
[00:26:12] it but I kind of missed a lot
[00:26:15] one is perfectly
[00:26:16] partaking in conversation
[00:26:22] but in the end remember that's
[00:26:24] misinformation must be addressed at all
[00:26:26] costs
[00:26:28] do not let your local streamers spread
[00:26:30] out
[00:26:31] silver
[00:26:32] I'm not spreading misinformation
[00:26:34] moreover her friendship oh [ __ ] I didn't
[00:26:36] mean to click
[00:26:38] realm of
[00:26:41] mute that cleansing Bell was one of
[00:26:43] guajiang's proudest works having the
[00:26:45] ability to both compose you missed shout
[00:26:48] and five yakshas yeah I was so tall if
[00:26:50] he tried to ride a roller coaster he
[00:26:52] would be denied due to his heart
[00:26:56] [Music]
[00:26:59] Street word Rambler a vain Beauty
[00:27:06] my foot that Bell has a sad history
[00:27:10] clearly she refrained from sharing with
[00:27:13] you the truth of its Origins uh-oh since
[00:27:16] the right time had not yet come as for
[00:27:19] her old friend
[00:27:21] who else could it be as soon as
[00:27:23] streetward Rambler heard that a certain
[00:27:26] Zhang Lee wished to borrow the Bell
[00:27:29] she realized that the man was none other
[00:27:31] than Rex lapis and that he had made an
[00:27:34] enormous decision after all we all have
[00:27:38] known each other for several millennia
[00:27:41] so they were talking in secret code
[00:27:48] enough of your intrusions
[00:27:51] roasted
[00:27:53] the cleansing Bell is powered by a
[00:27:56] mechanical art and can be used she said
[00:27:59] enough as an accompanying instrument
[00:28:02] after the passing of its creator it was
[00:28:05] used on numerous occasions during Rites
[00:28:07] of parting
[00:28:09] streetward Rambler did not acquire it
[00:28:11] from Rex lapis for the purpose of
[00:28:13] producing further funerary Tunes
[00:28:16] no
[00:28:18] it's time she rang it it was to play
[00:28:20] this okay this is a composed on it
[00:28:29] the two once clashed over their beliefs
[00:28:32] about the meaning of music
[00:28:35] who would have thought that with
[00:28:36] guajiang's passing and streetward
[00:28:39] Ramblers Mourning
[00:28:41] two Tunes composed in Discord would
[00:28:44] eventually become one harmonious
[00:28:46] composition
[00:28:51] Once Upon a Time Street would Rambler
[00:28:54] also had Discord
[00:28:57] yeah the adapter used Discord but after
[00:28:59] guaijong passed
[00:29:01] she preferred her okay so greyhong and
[00:29:03] and Madame ping were a thing good to
[00:29:06] know
[00:29:12] passed before she finally composed a
[00:29:15] Melody to our satisfaction
[00:29:17] in celebration she played the tune to
[00:29:20] the clouds
[00:29:22] incredibly one has only ever heard her
[00:29:24] Play That Tune once
[00:29:27] which brings one back to the matter
[00:29:29] you've been investigating
[00:29:32] perhaps it was during that performance
[00:29:34] that the ancestor of your Fontaine
[00:29:36] friend fell into the wall who's our
[00:29:38] Fontaine friends
[00:29:40] ancestor yeah yeah
[00:29:42] Monsieur golf greatly perplexed by this
[00:29:53] maybe that's a spoiler sorry if I
[00:29:55] spoiled all the Fontan for you but yeah
[00:29:58] in response she said though the strings
[00:30:02] that played that Melody survive
[00:30:04] the one who inspired it was gone okay
[00:30:08] tell me Cloud retainer when the one
[00:30:11] attuned to my soul was no longer here
[00:30:15] understand this tune
[00:30:20] I just remember being taken care of by
[00:30:23] you when I was young
[00:30:24] once the archon war came to an end I
[00:30:27] stayed behind in Leo Harbor to honor my
[00:30:29] contract although I met guaijung a few
[00:30:31] times
[00:30:32] was quite the Visionary
[00:30:35] The Tragically possibility
[00:30:45] finished sorry sorry that was
[00:30:46] unappropriate inappropriate
[00:30:48] inappropriate had you not decided to
[00:30:50] search inappropriate inappropriate
[00:30:53] perhaps these
[00:31:00] two that the adapters who rescued the
[00:31:02] drowning man was none other than
[00:31:04] streetward Rambler do you intend to
[00:31:06] discuss this with her no
[00:31:12] do you mean ping might find the topic
[00:31:15] too distressing precisely
[00:31:17] the passing of our old friend is the
[00:31:19] heavy topic that both if I may be so
[00:31:22] bold oh I've been in Leo Harbor for
[00:31:26] quite a long time now and I've witnessed
[00:31:28] many farewells along the way
[00:31:30] so I too am well acquainted with the
[00:31:33] pain of the passing of a loved one
[00:31:37] this doesn't bring the city or its
[00:31:39] people to a standstill
[00:31:41] they have to keep moving forward
[00:31:44] someone as perceptive and wise as ping
[00:31:46] will surely have come to understand and
[00:31:49] embrace this though these Immortal
[00:31:51] mountains have lost an Adept us
[00:31:53] the harbor of Mortals has gained a wise
[00:31:56] Elder no loss can ever be undone
[00:32:00] but there is always much that can still
[00:32:02] be gained ping has helped countless
[00:32:04] people and will guide many others in the
[00:32:07] years to come
[00:32:08] and all to whom she extends a helping
[00:32:11] hand become her friends
[00:32:13] people she can go it is heartbreaking to
[00:32:16] lose a kindred spirit Life Goes On
[00:32:20] because there are new we even asked
[00:32:22] Madam Payne what she thought about
[00:32:23] adding a music festival to this year oh
[00:32:25] when we get back
[00:32:28] you youngsters and your imaginations and
[00:32:31] why is she so why does she talk so old
[00:32:33] why don't you come with us I know she's
[00:32:35] like Millennium years old but still
[00:32:39] youngsters
[00:32:43] not every Lantern right the same in this
[00:32:46] regard
[00:32:47] were there ever anything new to discuss
[00:32:50] one in pink could mean any day of the
[00:32:52] year she's 3 000 years old yeah but did
[00:32:54] she start talking like this at one
[00:32:56] thousand that means that most of her
[00:32:58] life she's been like this different from
[00:33:00] those that have come before
[00:33:02] how long hmm
[00:33:04] the edibles
[00:33:09] very well
[00:33:12] Edibles yep if the other old fossils
[00:33:16] that sneaked away into the city to amuse
[00:33:18] themselves one shall soon find out all
[00:33:21] right that's cool we should be getting
[00:33:23] back to the harbors wait okay I'm kind
[00:33:25] of lost wait which one was to take back
[00:33:27] one praise from a moment prior you are
[00:33:30] still far too given to Flights of Fancy
[00:33:33] child what
[00:33:35] Cloud retainer you were still listening
[00:33:39] um one observed that you were making no
[00:33:42] effort to leave and returned to chasen
[00:33:44] and hasten you this time one time revoso
[00:33:52] okay anyways uh
[00:33:55] all right let's keep going I guess we
[00:33:57] need to get to the [ __ ] concert wait
[00:34:00] wait wait wait Cloud retainer
[00:34:07] yeah Cloud retainer was the one I
[00:34:08] thought was Zhao
[00:34:11] one is so mad true
[00:34:21] yeah or you could also pronounce it how
[00:34:24] I don't know if it's like how the J's
[00:34:26] meant to be pronounced
[00:34:34] whoa Madame ping and Cloud retainer it
[00:34:38] appears you made haste after all one
[00:34:41] arrived but moments before you
[00:34:44] oh bless my soul to what do I owe the
[00:34:49] honor I'm gonna sleep to this Quest I'm
[00:34:51] sorry dude I'm trying to get through it
[00:34:53] it's it's it's it's good lore you know
[00:34:56] you gotta learn this stuff for your
[00:34:57] culture what if you have an exam on this
[00:34:59] one be tasked with saying it also we're
[00:35:01] almost done
[00:35:03] oh
[00:35:07] yeah straight word oh
[00:35:12] thirteen months
[00:35:14] Cameron one uh
[00:35:18] given that Lantern right is almost upon
[00:35:21] us okay
[00:35:26] uh
[00:35:27] all right so this all started because we
[00:35:30] were trying to help Mr Dvorak find the
[00:35:32] adeptus who saved his ancestors life
[00:35:38] do the date with a child before ending
[00:35:40] stream or people riots wait how long
[00:35:42] does it take to get there and rescue the
[00:35:44] drowning man was none other than
[00:35:45] yourself
[00:35:48] ah let me think
[00:35:50] yes it's after this you believe I recall
[00:35:54] that encounter two hours okay it's not
[00:35:57] two hours
[00:35:58] what a long it's like 10 minutes for
[00:36:00] release
[00:36:02] I'm surprised that you still remember it
[00:36:04] even more astonishing perhaps is the
[00:36:07] fact that this story has survived this
[00:36:09] long at all
[00:36:10] when mortal lives are so very brief
[00:36:15] it appears that she has proven herself
[00:36:18] right once yeah I know they're both like
[00:36:20] million years old but can you talk a bit
[00:36:22] faster
[00:36:24] from the looking Club retainer's eyes I
[00:36:27] sense that she has already told you all
[00:36:29] about her
[00:36:31] albeit reluctantly
[00:36:34] there is no harm done after all
[00:36:38] Lantern did not live to see The Splendid
[00:36:41] sights of today
[00:36:42] she was as much of a hero as any other
[00:36:45] hero
[00:36:46] [Music]
[00:36:50] Once Upon a Time
[00:36:52] she said to me that humans were a weak
[00:36:56] form of life that she wished to protect
[00:36:59] with her wisdom
[00:37:00] but as she interacted she marveled at
[00:37:03] the beauty she told us that to
[00:37:05] underestimate okay the smallest amount
[00:37:08] of guidance and a human
[00:37:10] who has okay
[00:37:12] she always had a way with words okay her
[00:37:14] mechanical accomplishments were judged
[00:37:16] superiors speaking of mechanics Cloud
[00:37:18] retainer
[00:37:20] do you still remember the Course
[00:37:23] once said it takes every blade and I see
[00:37:27] the sight of Emily Harbor okay looks
[00:37:30] very emotional right now okay
[00:37:33] ah
[00:37:35] of all of us okay
[00:37:38] if she was still Harbor is always filled
[00:37:42] with the sound of music we've been dying
[00:37:45] to ask oh also I can make arrangements
[00:37:48] right away okay
[00:37:50] as much as I don't wish to dampen you
[00:37:53] it's been a long time since I played
[00:37:55] this zither and there was a period of
[00:37:59] time whenever I started strumming
[00:38:02] it almost felt like she was back again
[00:38:06] sitting right there on the stone next to
[00:38:09] me chatting away
[00:38:11] Sky bracer and sea gazer too looking
[00:38:15] just like they did in the old days
[00:38:17] no matter how much time goes by
[00:38:21] the moment so the past still weighs
[00:38:23] heavily on your heart
[00:38:25] no
[00:38:26] I would be lying to myself if I claimed
[00:38:28] to have completely moved on but that is
[00:38:31] not to say that grief she lost her wife
[00:38:33] the sadness
[00:38:35] I have found many things that just look
[00:38:37] at this potted plant oh my God why is

[01:01:17] I've long heard that your knowledge
[01:01:19] encompasses all things old and new Mr
[01:01:22] Jean offbeat but I never knew that you
[01:01:24] were well versed in the art of cooking
[01:01:26] too it is truly an honor to make your
[01:01:28] acquaintance here no need for
[01:01:31] formalities I do feel humbled to be in
[01:01:34] the company of such talented young
[01:01:36] people
[01:01:37] oh you flatter us
[01:01:39] um
[01:01:42] may I trouble you to provide a few words
[01:01:44] of guidance for my practices in exorcism
[01:01:48] exorcism
[01:01:49] I can't say I'm an expert in the field
[01:01:52] but if you don't mind we could start by
[01:01:54] discussing
[01:01:58] when is arriving
[01:02:02] [Music]
[01:02:06] here likewise please take a seat
[01:02:10] also is that rice to that so much
[01:02:15] w
[01:02:16] ow you're having fun
[01:02:18] me too so no that's good and performed
[01:02:21] before
[01:02:25] it's porridge performance
[01:02:31] to everyone
[01:02:32] they hope we'll have a wonderful
[01:02:34] Gathering
[01:02:35] the performance was spectacular indeed
[01:02:38] however it gave xiangling a huge burst
[01:02:41] of inspiration which in turn gave us a
[01:02:44] bit of a headache us did chongling ask
[01:02:47] you to try out her dishes too
[01:02:51] my friend is beside the point when you
[01:02:53] realize
[01:02:54] three-quarters of national team is here
[01:02:59] with eating my share too it isn't better
[01:03:02] to pull through
[01:03:05] oh
[01:03:09] here knows how to encourage people
[01:03:11] thanks pymon
[01:03:13] oh and I have to thank Mr Zhang Lee too
[01:03:16] he gave me lots of useful pointers that
[01:03:19] really drove it home for me
[01:03:20] oh so that's what you were talking about
[01:03:23] before we arrived yes since we'll be
[01:03:26] dining together the topic of it is child
[01:03:28] pulling through I invited him crazy
[01:03:30] ideas are truly unconventional her
[01:03:33] choices in both ingredients and spot my
[01:03:36] suggestions were nothing more than the
[01:03:37] icing on the cake
[01:03:39] all of the two of you now I'm getting
[01:03:42] embarrassed anyway I'm not skipping any
[01:03:46] shangling dialogue
[01:03:52] like it might become a little safer to
[01:03:54] eat
[01:03:55] I sample the dishes next time
[01:04:02] yeah where's guava
[01:04:04] [Music]
[01:04:07] here to help Dad at the restaurant
[01:04:10] um you know lots of people come over to
[01:04:12] eat during Lantern right without Global
[01:04:14] the Global's not gonna help he's gonna
[01:04:16] eat all the food he's literally no way
[01:04:18] guava's helping he's probably just
[01:04:19] eating the entire restaurant
[01:04:21] terrorizing the civilians the director
[01:04:23] went to collect a guest she asked me to
[01:04:26] stay here and host you for the time
[01:04:28] being seems like it's almost time
[01:04:31] everything
[01:04:35] oh that must mean they are super
[01:04:37] important could it be cutting
[01:04:42] or Captain Beetle she didn't clarify and
[01:04:46] as her subordinate it might be shall but
[01:04:49] no way Hotel got Xiao in person
[01:04:52] no way they're close like that
[01:04:54] ta-da we're here
[01:04:58] oh oh we're not late to the party right
[01:05:01] a good thing
[01:05:03] [Music]
[01:05:05] we made it just in time Michelle
[01:05:09] exclamation mark okay good talk bro what
[01:05:14] the [ __ ] bro what is this style I'm
[01:05:17] taking a screenshot of this the [ __ ] is
[01:05:19] this dialogue bro
[01:05:22] this
[01:05:24] oh
[01:05:26] I see so the important guest is the
[01:05:29] Conqueror ah father-son reunion I've
[01:05:32] been looking forward to meeting you the
[01:05:34] director didn't mention anything when
[01:05:36] she invited us what a pleasant surprise
[01:05:39] gathered here to convene here with all
[01:05:41] of you is indeed a great honor uh
[01:05:46] oh
[01:05:56] it's almost Lantern right yet you took
[01:05:59] all the truth dude why'd they make shout
[01:06:01] look like his kid this is a flashback
[01:06:03] this is years ago and now obviously shy
[01:06:04] was way taller but it was like a
[01:06:06] flashback so yeah
[01:06:09] the director has a way of making it
[01:06:12] difficult to decline
[01:06:14] Rex lapis may I ask what troubles you
[01:06:17] the direction this is what he was
[01:06:19] growing sesame oil in preparation for
[01:06:21] the celebrations
[01:06:23] yeah
[01:06:25] then why would you come all the way to
[01:06:27] Wong XU in no this is years ago with
[01:06:30] Chef Yen Xiao and received some spices
[01:06:33] from him and see
[01:06:38] has boots on that's why it like kills
[01:06:41] hmm it's a shame I couldn't find the
[01:06:45] kind the director was looking for
[01:06:54] I'm sure you're exaggerating Sean oh
[01:06:58] sir
[01:06:59] thumb there he goes again enough with
[01:07:03] the pleasantries go let our guests take
[01:07:05] a seat
[01:07:06] everyone here today is well known in
[01:07:08] their own field and has probably heard
[01:07:09] about one another to some extent some of
[01:07:12] us are even old acquaintances are you
[01:07:14] trying to be formal
[01:07:19] pretty close I know there's different
[01:07:22] ways to describe it but pretty close
[01:07:24] that's a PG way of putting it
[01:07:27] you two sit together take a C2 director
[01:07:30] hello
[01:07:33] When we arrive just now those that
[01:07:36] shinyui Kias told me our dishes are
[01:07:37] almost ready perfect timing let's not
[01:07:40] wait any longer and ask them to bring
[01:07:42] out the food Chow's feet won't hit the
[01:07:44] ground lamout
[01:07:47] no they will I don't know you're talking
[01:07:49] about it
[01:07:50] never guessed
[01:07:56] I guess also the first I've heard of The
[01:07:58] Traveler in pymon being friends with the
[01:07:59] Conqueror of demons yeah I mean you
[01:08:01] could say we're friends yeah
[01:08:05] for Nova statement
[01:08:06] oh did I remember when before shout came
[01:08:08] out
[01:08:09] wasn't Xiao mean to Chang Yun like this
[01:08:11] isn't there a changian voice line about
[01:08:13] ciao people are mad at how he was like I
[01:08:15] look up the show and the child was like
[01:08:16] useless worthless lament is that not a
[01:08:19] thing I think this is like before Xiao
[01:08:20] came out people are talking about that
[01:08:21] like two years ago you might not know
[01:08:23] this pymon but we exorcists have worked
[01:08:26] includes no collaboration I thought it
[01:08:27] was for many generations dispelling evil
[01:08:31] together both in the open and from the
[01:08:34] Shadows
[01:08:35] hard to imagine that thanks to huta only
[01:08:37] you would know that dude it's the chance
[01:08:39] to meet him
[01:08:40] conqueror of demons I am honored to make
[01:08:43] your acquaintance
[01:08:50] yeah yeah see I knew it dude I know this
[01:08:53] child Lord I'm telling you the building
[01:08:55] fake the conquer of Dunes himself has
[01:08:57] defended the way side by side with us
[01:08:58] existence for Generations I have the
[01:09:00] utmost respect for Xiao it's just why
[01:09:02] must he be so disparging towards us he
[01:09:04] says our repertoire is lacking in our
[01:09:05] power is Trivial I'm sorry but I can't
[01:09:07] accept that I'm telling you I knew this
[01:09:09] lore Charlie looks up to him but child
[01:09:11] was just like worthless useless lament
[01:09:12] true
[01:09:16] likewise
[01:09:18] oh it is a great honor indeed to have a
[01:09:21] chance to meet the legendary conqueror
[01:09:22] of demons Chung Yoon has brought that
[01:09:25] name of quite a few times in the past
[01:09:27] mentioning wanting him to understand the
[01:09:30] importance of exorcists
[01:09:35] [Music]
[01:09:38] wishes during the masterful chef's
[01:09:40] cook-off
[01:09:42] I didn't think we'd have the chance to
[01:09:44] meet again a happy Lantern right no
[01:09:47] anecdote however compares to meeting you
[01:09:50] in person I'm sincho shangling and Chong
[01:09:53] youth's friend the pleasure is all mine
[01:09:56] hello
[01:09:57] hey everyone's getting all formal and
[01:09:59] polite all of a sudden uh
[01:10:03] [Music]
[01:10:08] why is palmon ruining it literally
[01:10:10] ruining our ribs
[01:10:13] tried very hard to look for a fancy word
[01:10:15] okay there's no need to be so polite
[01:10:18] true
[01:10:19] okay you're right
[01:10:21] it's meant to be a nice little
[01:10:23] get-together between friends after all
[01:10:25] too much formality kills the atmosphere
[01:10:28] I didn't plan this Gathering only for
[01:10:30] everyone to walk on eggshells hiya
[01:10:32] what's your true intention then a little
[01:10:37] get-together between friends sipping the
[01:10:39] finest tea and watching lanterns float
[01:10:41] into the sky bidding farewell oh yeah
[01:10:45] and embracing the present with joy and
[01:10:48] that is something our consultant would
[01:10:50] say I think it deserves a standing
[01:10:52] ovation
[01:10:53] [Applause]
[01:10:56] okay
[01:10:57] exceptional acting skills director
[01:11:00] as for me I'm just here to have fun and
[01:11:03] treat everyone to something good we all
[01:11:05] worked really hard this year whether
[01:11:07] traveling or guiding cooking helping
[01:11:10] with the family business exercising evil
[01:11:12] spirits or conquering demons true and of
[01:11:16] course our consultant who's been helping
[01:11:18] out at the Parlor every now and then
[01:11:20] everyone has done some pretty amazing
[01:11:22] things as the one who brought everyone
[01:11:25] together it goes without saying that I'm
[01:11:28] the one let's do a little bro she thinks
[01:11:31] she's part of the she thinks she's part
[01:11:33] of the team
[01:11:34] who don't think she's part of the team
[01:11:39] fair enough though you got child you got
[01:11:41] child fair enough hey you brought ciao
[01:11:43] fair enough without it wasn't as
[01:11:44] complicated as you think oh
[01:11:47] what happened
[01:11:49] she is shut off I'm sorry I love
[01:11:51] football I actually like it though dude
[01:11:52] I'm about to joke I like Hotel okay
[01:11:56] gotcha thanks boss lady
[01:11:59] it's not boss lady just boss
[01:12:03] and There She Goes what a lively girl
[01:12:07] conquer of demons adopt a shower party
[01:12:10] in a Wongs you in here
[01:12:13] no way this worked
[01:12:15] no way this worked
[01:12:20] okay
[01:12:23] quiet
[01:12:24] disturb the peace
[01:12:27] but you wouldn't show up if I didn't
[01:12:29] yell your name would you
[01:12:32] I know you
[01:12:33] you're the 77th director of Wong shung
[01:12:36] Funeral Parlor
[01:12:37] is there something you need
[01:12:40] oh that was it
[01:12:43] she just said ciao
[01:12:49] that does sound like one of hutau's
[01:12:50] antics did the Conqueror of demons agree
[01:12:53] to come so that hutau would stop
[01:12:56] there might be other reasons ask me
[01:13:01] he came for me true it gets pretty
[01:13:04] boring from here on I talked about the
[01:13:06] funeral parlors past relationships with
[01:13:09] the guardian yakshas you know just to be
[01:13:12] sociable in the time of the archon war
[01:13:15] disputes were frequent and disaster
[01:13:18] overtook the land
[01:13:19] humans couldn't escape from the torment
[01:13:21] of the plague nor could they escape
[01:13:24] death okay Vanquish the demons the
[01:13:28] milolith fought valiantly just people
[01:13:30] talking Funeral Parlor was responsible
[01:13:33] for people that is how the border
[01:13:35] between life and death was maintained
[01:13:37] during the war okay that's right
[01:13:41] one point for the consultant but despite
[01:13:44] our deeper disconnection it still took
[01:13:46] me quite a while to actually convince
[01:13:48] him you know him pretty well huh this
[01:13:51] matter is out of my control
[01:13:53] so I need to be cautious
[01:13:55] true but I've kept that in mind too
[01:13:58] that's why everyone here today
[01:14:00] [Music]
[01:14:04] it'll only be for a short while As We
[01:14:07] Dine together dude the food's getting
[01:14:08] cold lasting consequences shingling made
[01:14:11] all of this for us
[01:14:12] surely we can talk what we eat there's
[01:14:15] no need to worry conqueror of demons
[01:14:17] we're not feeling anything unusual so
[01:14:20] far she didn't make it whatever who made
[01:14:21] it there whatever someone made it for us
[01:14:23] pure Yang energy so he's probably the
[01:14:27] most resilient
[01:14:28] that's not the same me
[01:14:31] they're at a restaurant oh did you just
[01:14:33] tossing what are carrots into my book
[01:14:35] The Chef made it for you then hey don't

[01:14:37] huh what
[01:14:41] Chang Yoon I saw that hey what is
[01:14:43] happening
[01:14:59] good but now that I think of it

[01:15:03] the stove God
[01:15:05] you don't want to [ __ ] with Google
[01:15:06] sounds like you've heard the rumors
[01:15:11] then imagine you're a little kid and you
[01:15:13] don't want to eat your vegetables and
[01:15:14] then guoba starts running at you

[01:17:56] um monsters become more active than
[01:17:58] usual as we get closer to Lantern right
[01:18:00] I was patrolling dihwa Marsh a few days
[01:18:02] ago when I happened to run into this
[01:18:05] this
[01:18:07] you've already forgotten I'm a Bard
[01:18:10] remember and bards go around singing
[01:18:13] wherever they like the acting I can't
[01:18:17] and this Bard was performing in dihon
[01:18:19] Marsh
[01:18:20] it was a moving yeah it feels like it
[01:18:23] made me feel relaxed
[01:18:26] I don't know couldn't help but stay and
[01:18:29] listen
[01:18:30] thank you for your patronage
[01:18:34] I understand now too
[01:18:38] I'm Jeong Lee currently working at the
[01:18:40] Wang Chung Funeral Parlor it's a
[01:18:43] pleasure to meet you why is it tense I
[01:18:45] don't know
[01:18:48] oh and if there's anything
[01:18:50] unsatisfactory let me know anytime
[01:18:53] very considerate of you
[01:18:55] oh
[01:18:57] no wonder
[01:18:59] says Savvy and reliable as you would be
[01:19:02] able to hire such an impressive
[01:19:04] consultant
[01:19:06] oh you're too nice Fenty not to brag but
[01:19:10] our consultant truly is impressive his
[01:19:13] knowledge extends across the stars in
[01:19:16] the land and there's nothing throughout
[01:19:17] history that he doesn't know from the
[01:19:20] sophisticatedness he speaks it's hard
[01:19:22] not to suspect that he could very well
[01:19:24] be an adeptice in disguise
[01:19:32] you think it might be possible I
[01:19:36] I thought oh
[01:19:38] anchoring demons okay I don't have much
[01:19:41] knowledge in that matter
[01:19:44] uh really
[01:19:46] super knowledgeable come on play along
[01:19:51] dude pymon is actually did pylon's the
[01:19:54] biggest [ __ ] Blocker in the world
[01:19:57] [Music]
[01:19:59] pray for him to not know anything
[01:20:04] yeah
[01:20:05] really I've actually heard a few things
[01:20:09] about Mr Zhang Lee before Oh the guests
[01:20:12] in the tavern talked about this refined
[01:20:14] and courteous man who instead of having
[01:20:17] wine the finest Tavern ordered a cup of
[01:20:20] hot tea with the most complex name
[01:20:24] dude there is charts are going I seem to
[01:20:27] recall that there indeed is a musician
[01:20:29] like yourself in monstat I've heard that
[01:20:32] he's elegant and amiable his Works witty
[01:20:35] and vibrant it's no overstatement to
[01:20:38] regard him as the best body best part in
[01:20:41] Monster
[01:20:48] run of the middle sometimes
[01:20:50] there's one I heard a while back that
[01:20:52] went
[01:20:53] the old house is renewed welcoming the
[01:20:57] spring Breeze Awakening old memories
[01:21:01] the meanings there but the word choices
[01:21:03] are unimaginative and there's a distinct
[01:21:06] lack of literary Flair
[01:21:08] I think so too the composition needs a
[01:21:11] little jazzing up if I were to give it a
[01:21:13] go I'd make it an old melon on a vine a
[01:21:17] new flower that grows fine who don't
[01:21:19] stop rhyming For the Love of All Things
[01:21:21] holy stop forming Rhymes and and
[01:21:33] with their shaking hands why is wrongly
[01:21:36] disappointed why is shoutest what is
[01:21:39] happening hmm
[01:21:43] the books when we get back
[01:21:45] ones
[01:21:47] know if it's my own lack of literary
[01:21:49] knowledge but I couldn't tell the
[01:21:51] difference between those two I don't
[01:21:54] think it's your fault chongyun's right

[01:22:15] lantern ripe Music Festival this year as
[01:22:18] a musician myself how could I possibly
[01:22:20] annoy everyone is here
[01:22:26] music Styles is a scent essential to
[01:22:28] sparking

[01:22:40] [Music]

[01:22:50] to notice me
[01:22:52] eat the [ __ ] food true the food is
[01:22:55] actually just no longer edible the sound
[01:22:58] of the Wind
[01:23:01] whenever Lantern Right comes around Leo
[01:23:04] Harbor becomes bustling with activity
[01:23:08] is that
[01:23:10] is
[01:23:10] in bustling that's the most oldest thing
[01:23:14] I've ever heard it is rather difficult
[01:23:16] this guy said bustling
[01:23:18] again
[01:23:20] the festival is in full swing and
[01:23:22] proceeding smoothly and we're all
[01:23:25] gathered here with Friends new and old
[01:23:26] this is no doubt a wonderful occasion
[01:23:29] worth celebrating if we don't eat food
[01:23:31] within the next 30 seconds I'm peeing on
[01:23:33] the table
[01:23:34] one can't help but be filled with joy in
[01:23:38] A Moment Like This I propose we raise a

[01:23:53] exactly what I want to
[01:23:55] knowing wrongly finally has people to
[01:23:58] share the memories of osmanthus wine
[01:24:00] with and instead he pulls up tea
[01:24:05] enduring occasions like this
[01:24:09] Mr Zhang Lee insists on drinking tea
[01:24:12] I'll give a toast with tea too everyone
[01:24:15] thanks for the treat

[01:25:43] after this
[01:25:44] I should be the one asking you that
[01:25:48] I
[01:25:50] it's hard to describe
[01:25:52] unfamiliar with Gatherings like this
[01:25:54] it's not that there were those among the
[01:25:56] adeptide Among Us
[01:26:00] sometimes they would call up a few
[01:26:01] others for a drink
[01:26:03] a Wizard of Oz many times
[01:26:07] the Adept I all have their Specialties
[01:26:09] making most of them proud and arrogant
[01:26:12] everything they say is Straight From the
[01:26:13] Heart it never gets too complicated
[01:26:18] this time
[01:26:21] uh-oh uh oh which dad are we picking
[01:26:24] which dad are we picking I'm gaslighting
[01:26:27] I'm gaslighting venti because he's
[01:26:28] always drunk no no
[01:26:30] I didn't mean that
[01:26:32] so you know his true identity
[01:26:35] I'll get straight to the point then
[01:26:37] the animal archon is a free spirit
[01:26:40] and his temperament is as carefree as
[01:26:42] the music he plays bad ending
[01:26:45] it's easy for a god like him to live in
[01:26:47] harmony with humans wait did it matter
[01:26:49] what the [ __ ]
[01:26:54] missed sex scene dude I didn't miss this
[01:26:58] no dude dude it's not that's not what
[01:27:01] happens that's not what I imagine
[01:27:04] imagine if there's like 10 options and
[01:27:06] if you choose like you have to choose
[01:27:07] every dialogue option correct if not you
[01:27:10] don't kiss Xiao
[01:27:12] uh you do you true
[01:27:15] that does sound like something you would
[01:27:17] say no matter I know my circumstances
[01:27:23] whenever I think of the ordinary
[01:27:24] conversations I've had with you novel
[01:27:28] strangely novel strange in a good way
[01:27:30] that that's that's like medium risk
[01:27:32] that's Medium you're like okay I I'm
[01:27:33] making sure you know oh bye we're in
[01:27:36] we're actually you're actually in the
[01:27:38] invitation
[01:27:39] so it was difficult to turn her down it
[01:27:41] sounds like it's strangely special when
[01:27:43] we talk and you're like in a good way
[01:27:44] and they say yes that's double you tell
[01:27:47] told me that all the guests today would
[01:27:48] be acquainted with elemental power
[01:27:51] and I knew that you would be here
[01:27:53] but I didn't expect the other guests to
[01:27:55] be
[01:27:56] no one would have guessed to Pieces
[01:27:58] always said that we should live in the
[01:27:59] present and enjoy every pleasant
[01:28:01] surprise
[01:28:03] perhaps that's what I should do with
[01:28:04] what I'm feeling now
[01:28:06] oh
[01:28:08] oh I think he meant designing clothes
[01:28:10] for those around him
[01:28:12] clothes were intricately designed
[01:28:15] but inconvenient to wear
[01:28:17] brother bocius never tried to hide his
[01:28:20] distaste he said live for the moment
[01:28:21] that's a pimple quote like his designs
[01:28:25] the outfit he wears now was also
[01:28:27] designed by General capisis himself
[01:28:30] I never saw him wear this during the war
[01:28:33] I didn't expect him to start wearing it
[01:28:35] later oh here you are no dude

[01:32:05] dessert is all pymons
[01:32:07] sorry to keep everyone waiting

[01:32:19] -eyed it's all the same
[01:32:21] strive to be more like on wait that dude

[01:32:26] literally bullies Chichi for no reason
[01:32:28] who that was literally the one who
[01:32:30] Causes Chaos just cause she can for fun
[01:32:33] and when pymon is I can learn from that
[01:32:36] you know that's low
[01:32:42] he doesn't anymore
[01:32:45] deserves something ceremonious
[01:32:48] oh is this some local custom
[01:32:55] something I made up so that good luck
[01:32:57] will be on our side that's all based
[01:33:00] spontaneity is the best choice to make
[01:33:02] here
[01:33:03] um let's use this incense burner on the
[01:33:05] table it's been lit for so long now that
[01:33:08] the incense is running out I'll leave
[01:33:10] refilling and lighting the incense to
[01:33:12] the most distinguished guest among us
[01:33:15] all
[01:33:16] lighting the incense will signify
[01:33:18] continuous growth and prosperity in all
[01:33:21] our endeavors in the new year
[01:33:24] see perfect symbolism as expected of
[01:33:28] hotel and speaking of the most
[01:33:30] distinguished guest here today I'm sure
[01:33:33] we all agree why is he looking at a wall
[01:33:35] bro what are you doing are you familiar
[01:33:38] with the details of his past Deeds but
[01:33:42] chatting with him has been a real
[01:33:43] eye-opener even for a Bard who has
[01:33:46] traveled all across the
[01:33:48] cross knowledge objection what
[01:33:51] that you're a wielder of unlimited
[01:33:54] strength but when it comes to having a
[01:33:57] way with words the notable Bard is
[01:33:59] certainly one Cut Above the Rest
[01:34:02] I just happen to have a good memory it
[01:34:04] is such an unexceptional skill yet you
[01:34:07] made it sound like an unparalleled
[01:34:09] talent I am truly impressed
[01:34:12] since we all get to nominate someone
[01:34:15] oh
[01:34:19] um
[01:34:20] I think it's only fair that we let the
[01:34:23] Parlor director light the incense huh
[01:34:26] do don't flatter me just because I'm
[01:34:29] your boss we are looking for the most
[01:34:31] distinguished guest here as the host I
[01:34:34] shouldn't be involved in this discussion
[01:34:36] at all that we've enjoyed this table
[01:34:38] full of Delicacies how about we let our
[01:34:41] one and only Chef here do the honors
[01:34:43] [ __ ] nevermind um
[01:34:45] is this really the way this works I
[01:34:48] didn't cook any of these dishes it's not
[01:34:50] just look at her xiangling the disciple
[01:34:54] of an adoptist the stove God's best
[01:34:56] companion the winner but that was a good
[01:34:58] friend competition or the worst friend
[01:35:00] depending on who you are but
[01:35:09] uh why does my mom feel like we're back
[01:35:12] at square one again
[01:35:15] please
[01:35:20] please you know what is happening in
[01:35:22] this [ __ ] cutscene what am I watching
[01:35:25] it's
[01:35:29] bro what am I watching
[01:35:33] not a bad choice
[01:35:39] in the new year that's not how it works
[01:35:42] making a fortune is indeed a fine wish
[01:35:45] but it's of lesser importance than good
[01:35:48] health and happiness which means we
[01:35:51] should choose Chong Yoon the skilled
[01:35:53] Exorcist who keeps everyone's home safe
[01:35:55] from evil spirits oh
[01:36:00] I can't be the one when we have the
[01:36:03] Conqueror of demons right here but depth
[01:36:05] to Shao has the most seniority among
[01:36:07] everyone here today we
[01:36:10] I refuse
[01:36:11] I most certainly not the most
[01:36:13] distinguished guest here is he gonna say
[01:36:16] it's wrong with you should all be able
[01:36:17] to make the right judgment based on your
[01:36:18] observations one person here is well
[01:36:21] acquainted with everyone else
[01:36:23] oh
[01:36:26] what are these faces bro what are you

[01:36:37] talk to you again huh
[01:36:40] who else is there
[01:36:43] wait no way
[01:36:45] huh
[01:36:48] being pylons the most distinguished
[01:36:51] guest
[01:36:52] oh well that was unexpected 50 gifted if
[01:36:56] Xiao unleashes his Elemental burst bane
[01:36:59] of all evil to plunge pymon without
[01:37:02] you by your side
[01:37:10] I've brighten up the atmosphere
[01:37:11] everything along the way will become
[01:37:14] Lively and vibrant too ah The Traveler
[01:37:18] has traversed many nations and left
[01:37:20] behind a great deal of fascinating
[01:37:22] stories if only we had an outfit for the
[01:37:25] traveler to represent each nation that
[01:37:27] we traveled uh into civil role in making
[01:37:30] good happy and smooth one

[01:37:56] guoba is to me
[01:37:57] to me looks like we've come to an
[01:37:59] agreement dude imagine oh my God true
[01:38:02] shangling imagine if we had globa
[01:38:04] instead of pymon

[01:40:54] with a sumeru scholar named Soraya and
[01:40:57] learned a few things about her research
[01:40:59] topic from the evidence she found in the
[01:41:02] conclusion she made but the longest
[01:41:04] question I did not expect this to be
[01:41:06] long I'm not gonna lie I thought it was
[01:41:07] gonna be like 20 minutes
[01:41:08] in the Legends recorded by but whether
[01:41:11] to me street word Rambler Cloud retainer
[01:41:14] or younger adeptide such as Xiao and
[01:41:17] ganyu those Adept eye in gods that may
[01:41:20] seem extraordinary to humans are
[01:41:22] something more akin to close companions
[01:41:25] this was as true back then as it is
[01:41:28] right now
[01:41:29] just how shall may seem unapproachable
[01:41:31] to most but the traveler has proved
[01:41:33] otherwise true so there's no need to
[01:41:36] dwell literally in his DMs
[01:41:42] what you're saying is it looks like you
[01:41:46] understood what I meant ah
[01:41:49] um the director asked me to accompany
[01:41:51] you on your return
[01:41:53] but I don't think you'll need my
[01:41:55] protection dude Jolly actually taking a
[01:41:58] walk he said he said I'll leave you two

[01:46:18] generate resin wasting
[01:46:19] artistic finesse I'm sure nothing will
[01:46:22] go wrong but I'm afraid the sailors
[01:46:24] bored are not the most burst in the Arts

[01:46:28] deeper meaning their poetry holds
[01:46:33] poetry is spur of the moment creations
[01:46:37] there's a portan monstat too but I
[01:46:40] rarely get the chance to board any of

[01:47:07] lament because venti's shorts there's
[01:47:09] not much I can do about that it's not
