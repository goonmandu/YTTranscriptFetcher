[00:07:18] swapping and wishing so long that even
[00:07:21] my heart of things my account is trash
[00:07:23] but I never try changing should probably
[00:07:25] deserve it she was given for free me
[00:07:28] using handles on her love and someone
[00:07:30] said to wash my mouth stop talking or
[00:07:33] you and you Mia might never leave for

[00:07:37] needs some help as I from channeling I
[00:07:39] see that I'm because
[00:07:42] everything dies
[00:07:47] on my knees in the night saying praise
[00:07:50] to the stove God
[00:07:51] [Music]
[00:07:56] what the [ __ ] is up chat hello it's me

[00:08:03] [Music]
[00:08:10] dude I stream three times in two days I
[00:08:13] only slept once not even a full sleeve
[00:08:15] it was like a knob and I changed shirts
[00:08:18] three times to uh make an illusion like
[00:08:21] I'm like living life like a normal
[00:08:23] person I'm not I'm actually suffering
[00:08:31] but uh after I did stream yesterday well
[00:08:34] today technically yesterday I don't know
[00:08:36] after edit stream whenever it was
[00:08:38] uh for the 318 live stream I was gonna
[00:08:40] go to bed but then my dad was like do
[00:08:42] you want to go out son so then we went
[00:08:43] out we went to get groceries and then we
[00:08:46] I went to we got breakfast
[00:08:49] and then I came home I passed out for
[00:08:51] like five hours at an alarm and then I
[00:08:54] worked a bit on the Beto video and I
[00:08:56] just procrastinated or did other I think
[00:08:57] I rewatched oh yeah am I free to play
[00:08:59] the free to play account is almost oh
[00:09:00] it's basically it's done I just did like
[00:09:01] review it
[00:09:04] there's a delay on my webcam but it's
[00:09:06] fine so yeah
[00:09:08] and now I'm here and then tomorrow I'm
[00:09:10] gonna work on some videos
[00:09:11] I'm gonna prep a bunch of videos and and
[00:09:13] and [ __ ] before ax and stream so I'm
[00:09:16] gonna be working because that's in like
[00:09:17] a week and it's for like a week so yeah
[00:09:21] guys welcome to this
[00:09:25] for sure
[00:09:27] um
[00:09:29] I don't know what I'm gonna do with the
[00:09:31] rerun characters because it's Eula and
[00:09:32] Klee and look I'm happy to see Eula
[00:09:35] again please please and we love them
[00:09:37] both
[00:09:38] but like
[00:09:41] I don't know if I want to make a cliga
[00:09:44] okay I'll just make a shangling guide
[00:09:49] dude Michael is
[00:09:51] [Music]
[00:09:55] two level 60.
[00:10:01] let's just friendship let's just
[00:10:03] basically [ __ ] friendship 10 though
[00:10:04] actually
[00:10:05] yeah Kyle guy's gonna happen though
[00:10:12] it is uh yeah I might I'm gonna make a
[00:10:15] shingling guide because the last one's
[00:10:16] outdated so we're gonna make a shangling
[00:10:18] guide for Clee but we might also make a
[00:10:20] click on I don't know I think we'll do
[00:10:21] Eula and then maybe I'll do a should you
[00:10:23] put me I'll make a guy I don't know no
[00:10:24] promises we'll see
[00:10:26] because I also have to travel soon so I
[00:10:28] don't have that much time
[00:10:29] I could also make like a a condensed
[00:10:32] video like a treaty pool but we'll see
[00:10:37] [Music]
[00:10:44] after all the EULA jokes can't wait for
[00:10:45] people to skip the banners I mean even
[00:10:47] bad characters deserve a rerun
[00:10:50] no disrespect to Eula but like I wanna
[00:10:52] if a character never got a rerun I
[00:10:54] wanted to get a rerun even if I don't
[00:10:55] care about them granted I care about
[00:10:57] Eula I love her she's great I love her
[00:10:59] but I'm just saying I'm just saying
[00:11:02] [Music]
[00:11:03] hi Fang
[00:11:09] add you last I'm not adding you last
[00:11:12] I do okay I do think though that like it
[00:11:15] kind of doesn't make sense that if we
[00:11:17] get seven regions Plus konorrhea or
[00:11:19] whatever the [ __ ] and then another Geo
[00:11:21] region because Geo doesn't actually have
[00:11:22] a region yet so like nine regions are we
[00:11:24] ever like surely we just get a a a
[00:11:27] limited standard Banner example like a
[00:11:29] rotationing banner like dude nobody dude
[00:11:33] if CLI Alberto and Eula were in the
[00:11:35] standard Banner no one would cry like I
[00:11:37] feel like when I play like I play the
[00:11:39] only other gotcha can I play is like
[00:11:40] Cookie Run Kingdom when I'm playing
[00:11:41] Cookie Run I'm not hoping some random
[00:11:44] idiot gets a rerun I can just pull it on
[00:11:46] the standard and we're chilling
[00:11:49] so like at this point it's like dude
[00:11:51] there's so many reruns there's so many
[00:11:54] reruns like it's cool but like think
[00:11:56] about when after Fontan [ __ ] fire
[00:11:58] regions out okay what we're gonna be
[00:12:00] re-running Albedo then it's like oh
[00:12:02] Jeong Li venti [ __ ] Eula call me
[00:12:04] Ryden yai yilon [ __ ] like every
[00:12:07] [ __ ] character
[00:12:09] and then it's just like but there's also
[00:12:10] new characters coming out we'll see
[00:12:14] yeah they might do like three banners
[00:12:16] actually but like I feel like it'd be
[00:12:17] better if they did one new character
[00:12:19] banner and then one like a standard
[00:12:22] banner and then even if okay the ideal
[00:12:24] is they add [ __ ] to the Center Banner
[00:12:25] but if they don't want to do that or
[00:12:27] maybe a better solution is you can have
[00:12:29] a middle Banner like a banner that's
[00:12:30] like
[00:12:31] about it dude put a banner with like
[00:12:33] like a better that's like monster banner
[00:12:35] and that's like Albedo cleula like venti
[00:12:38] and then you don't have to rerun them
[00:12:40] all the time and then they're on that
[00:12:41] banner and then you could pull on it if
[00:12:42] you want because it's not like people
[00:12:44] are like saving their [ __ ] Primos for
[00:12:46] like like maybe you are but I'm just
[00:12:48] saying like
[00:12:52] but also it wouldn't have to be
[00:12:54] permanent
[00:12:57] it could alternate
[00:13:05] but and they would make money from it
[00:13:07] it's not like they're dude it's not like
[00:13:08] they're gonna rake in the money from a
[00:13:10] [ __ ] CLI Eula batter like I'm sorry I
[00:13:13] like YULA as much as the next person but
[00:13:15] it's not like they're printing money
[00:13:16] without rerun
[00:13:19] anyways
[00:13:22] um we have a lot of things to do
[00:13:27] also I did the mistake of getting
[00:13:29] another Lucero theme song stuck in my
[00:13:30] head I always [ __ ] do that because I
[00:13:32] listen to them and then I [ __ ] I'm
[00:13:33] actually angry it's fine Whirlpool then
[00:13:36] gentle then we're gonna talk what we're
[00:13:37] gonna do today
[00:13:40] um my mic is making weird creaky noises
[00:13:42] whenever I move it it's annoying me but
[00:13:44] it's fine
[00:13:48] which song I'm not telling you because
[00:13:49] that's gonna get stuck in my head give
[00:13:51] me a close shot

[00:20:56] listen you can't okay you can't argue
[00:20:59] that the voice and intonation of a
[00:21:02] character doesn't change the way you

[00:22:48] peel it and then eat like whatever the
[00:22:49] fruit is
[00:22:51] like um like those per those like orange
[00:22:53] fruits not a papaya it's like
[00:22:56] like I know the like Arabic word for it

[00:23:05] dailies Chad do you see what I tweeted
[00:23:07] do you see this
[00:23:10] what do you think everyone say how much
[00:23:12] they love Kai's new outfit but honestly
[00:23:13] I don't know it's really cool at all but
[00:23:15] personally I think you should just take
[00:23:16] it off while having clothes would just
[00:23:18] slow him down as a fighter anyways so
[00:23:20] he's off he obviously shouldn't wear any
[00:23:21] true or no
[00:23:25] dish saw it though so I don't know if I
[00:23:27] don't know if this ruins my reputation
[00:23:28] but
[00:23:30] sliced reacted to it oh [ __ ] [ __ ] wait
[00:23:33] did he I couldn't tell you
[00:23:39] um well anyways
[00:23:43] yeah so today we're doing genchin maybe

[00:24:33] uh where's my webcam
[00:24:40] wait why is my cam here what the [ __ ]

[00:25:41] serious question
[00:25:43] how is that that's not a serious
[00:25:45] question don't say serious question and
[00:25:47] then ask an unserious question
[00:25:56] show it okay but you're not allowed to
[00:25:58] judge me I was like okay I'm I'm Gonna
[00:26:00] Keep it like 600 with you like I'm
[00:26:02] honest it was like okay but I'm also
[00:26:05] like Rusty and it's my four fun account
[00:26:07] so don't like it's like okay like like
[00:26:11] I kind of forgot how to dodge flashes
[00:26:13] and my cross replacement's bad but other
[00:26:14] than that it's like okay
[00:26:18] you said you carried I mean I did but
[00:26:20] that doesn't mean I played like perfect
[00:26:23] you could play Bad and still carry
[00:26:25] all right let me get it
[00:26:31] pretty mug you're a pretty mug sorry
[00:26:34] yeah just go Shadow with a Healer like
[00:26:36] kokomi Barbara or like Diana if you're
[00:26:38] running well you usually don't run
[00:26:39] shanha and Iona unless you're doing mono
[00:26:42] cryo which you can but yeah
[00:26:47] here but you only get to see it once
[00:26:49] actually I'm not pausing my music
[00:26:50] because I play the music
[00:26:53] again for fun Arc okay um keep in mind
[00:26:56] I'm Rusty
[00:26:58] but I also don't miss ever
[00:27:02] oh
[00:27:03] that's not bad actually I was lucky but
[00:27:11] random player I'm not a random player
[00:27:13] but I said for fun right so this is for
[00:27:15] fun
[00:27:19] I know where my Crosshair was here also
[00:27:21] I don't know how I got flashed here this
[00:27:22] is actually [ __ ] like I wasn't
[00:27:24] looking at it
[00:27:33] and we are done
[00:27:37] recording yourself no I have outplayed
[00:27:39] so just because the game in the
[00:27:40] background and I delete it that's why I
[00:27:41] have no [ __ ] space on my drive
[00:27:43] it wasn't like it wasn't okay first game
[00:27:45] in forever but it was actually pretty
[00:27:46] good but the thing like I don't know how
[00:27:48] I hit this the first shot I kind of
[00:27:49] impressed myself
[00:27:55] it's not that high I'm just not used to
[00:27:57] it anymore if I'm like getting used to
[00:27:59] it
[00:28:00] you know I I one fourth it because I
[00:28:02] played Genji so Genji needs really high
[00:28:03] sense and OverWatch so I had to like for
[00:28:05] Val I had to lower it then lower it then
[00:28:07] lower it
[00:28:08] so it's like one-fourth of what it used
[00:28:09] to be it's like yeah
[00:28:12] but also how the [ __ ] does this flash me
[00:28:14] like I get that it's not like dude it's
[00:28:15] not even on my screen
[00:28:17] look I'm looking here and I got Flash
[00:28:19] from Maine
[00:28:22] don't listen
[00:28:28] anyways
[00:28:39] no alto's NPC I mean I was 1v5 1v3 when
[00:28:43] I could have vaulted because look like
[00:28:44] look
[00:28:46] I'm gonna I'm just gonna say it like I
[00:28:47] know Reina alt is useless and you should
[00:28:49] use it whenever you have it because who
[00:28:50] cares but like
[00:28:52] listen like do you know how bad Envy
[00:28:55] team has to be to lose this right here
[00:28:56] like listen to the bomb ticking
[00:29:00] it like it's about to speed up like why
[00:29:02] the [ __ ] would I alt or walk out of
[00:29:04] smoke they all go along and I lose Omen
[00:29:05] smokes the bomb I go they go along or no
[00:29:07] oven doesn't smoke a bomb but Omen
[00:29:09] smokes like anything literally anything
[00:29:10] off like this and I just lose
[00:29:13] so it's like why the [ __ ] would I just
[00:29:15] oh so I jumped out when they flashed
[00:29:17] just out of desperation but then he tp'd
[00:29:18] there like a [ __ ] idiot so I got that
[00:29:20] like they just threw
[00:29:22] huh
[00:29:23] I don't know I was debating it but I was
[00:29:25] like there's no way
[00:29:27] anyways genshin wow time to do my
[00:29:31] dailies
[00:29:35] follow language way too dank
[00:29:37] okay it's not that dank
[00:29:40] it's not that thing
[00:29:47] follow duo with Yulie I used it on
[00:29:49] washed how I spent space
[00:29:54] I spam spacebar on everything that I
[00:29:57] love I was mashing my spacebar to fly I
[00:30:00] don't know why it wouldn't let me Glide
[00:30:01] that has to be a glitch because I swear
[00:30:04] I was spamming it
[00:30:05] like why would I lie about that why
[00:30:07] would I not be spamming's spacebar so I
[00:30:09] don't know how it got interrupted
[00:30:14] dude how is that my fault
[00:30:17] how is that my phone I'm killing those
[00:30:19] pictures and I'm not
[00:30:23] there's no current yet but you can still
[00:30:25] Glide like if you jump off a cliff you
[00:30:27] can still Glide in-game you can still
[00:30:29] Glide
[00:30:32] I don't know
[00:30:37] king of Genius invocations TCG
[00:30:42] no stamina but I know I had stamina when
[00:30:45] I was doing this maybe like Regents not
[00:30:46] enough for me but when I looked I had
[00:30:47] stamina so I don't know
[00:30:57] no I said in game because I said if you
[00:30:59] jump off a cliff you can glide obviously
[00:31:02] I met in game I had to specify I'm not
[00:31:04] trying to have a silver wolf moment

[00:31:10] community to call that silver wolf
[00:31:11] moments please thank you

[00:31:31] inspect
[00:31:37] what silver wolf something nothing
[00:31:39] nothing if you don't know you don't know
[00:31:42] silver wolf is innocent until proven
[00:31:44] guilty
[00:31:46] there have just been rumors flying
[00:31:47] around
[00:31:50] me please

[00:32:02] how's that your first message I don't

[00:32:23] with it but I also had a level baiju's
[00:32:25] talents because if I just pretty good
[00:32:26] and I like them so
[00:32:28] like it's pretty comfy oh that's not
[00:32:30] today
[00:32:36] this should be the place let's find a
[00:32:39] spot to hide and
[00:32:42] bro what did I just it's gonna come down
[00:32:44] to a fight one way or another so let's
[00:32:46] all be careful no need to worry
[00:32:50] dude what what did I just start
[00:33:00] here they come are you ready dude I
[00:33:01] can't wait for Dad to come out though
[00:33:03] she's actually so cool
[00:33:07] they are so sick man oh we can play as
[00:33:09] her trial okay let's see what she does
[00:33:12] skill or a burning field okay it's
[00:33:15] probably good for like virgin yeah we
[00:33:17] could probably burgeon a lot with this
[00:33:18] see okay yeah yeah yeah okay yeah that's
[00:33:21] probably good
[00:33:23] I wonder what it all does
[00:33:34] I love her so much why do you do this
[00:33:36] yeah same dude
[00:33:42] like a lot of how much people like about
[00:33:44] a character just comes from gameplay
[00:33:47] might have worked on an amateur but I
[00:33:49] know think about it though what you've
[00:33:51] got five
[00:33:53] I'm not joking too
[00:33:56] but honestly like
[00:34:00] hot take right are you
[00:34:03] hot take right yeah unless it's your
[00:34:05] email yo what do you mean by that what
[00:34:06] do you mean by that you try to get the
[00:34:08] YouTube commenters against me again dude
[00:34:10] you don't understand a lot like every
[00:34:12] character has their Defenders but no one
[00:34:14] is more chatting than the people that
[00:34:16] like are always talking about how your
[00:34:18] Mia is better than hutau in their world
[00:34:20] and how in single Target single boss
[00:34:22] situations uh I am wrong
[00:34:27] so don't please please we love your Mia
[00:34:29] pod friend we love her
[00:34:32] this is a prime
[00:34:35] um
[00:34:36] what did I want to say yeah okay on
[00:34:38] ironically hear me out here please hear
[00:34:40] me out please
[00:34:45] who is defending Dory you'd be surprised
[00:34:53] um
[00:34:56] keep me out okay so in this team but
[00:34:59] arguably arguably also
[00:35:05] uh arguably more arguably in this deal
[00:35:08] right your last song Here usually you
[00:35:10] want a comfy shielder and a lot of the
[00:35:12] abysses where you get [ __ ] around and
[00:35:13] then your scaramuki spends all of his
[00:35:16] time inside of his flying form just
[00:35:17] getting knocked interrupted and dying in
[00:35:19] this team
[00:35:21] a lot of the times Thomas can be
[00:35:23] preferred over zhangli not just because
[00:35:26] he's like better but because it's like
[00:35:29] so here's the thing John Lee runs Millet
[00:35:31] right but all the times this team you
[00:35:33] can already have millet
[00:35:34] you can already have milleth and then
[00:35:36] Thomas can do something uh like with C6
[00:35:40] fires on right and then Toma can do the
[00:35:42] following Tomah can do give you power
[00:35:44] resonance give you energy with a five
[00:35:46] lines but also just power energy to your
[00:35:48] Bennett who can't really get injury
[00:35:50] because farzan gives you negative and
[00:35:52] wander so it can help
[00:35:55] and it's just like a decent skara team
[00:35:57] now what I would like to argue is if
[00:36:00] you're oh yeah and that's also the the
[00:36:02] thing I forgot I knew there's something
[00:36:03] else also C6 Toma that's the the main
[00:36:05] thing I was gonna say that I [ __ ]
[00:36:06] forgot about uh C6 Toma also gives you
[00:36:08] some damage so that's like the thing
[00:36:10] right
[00:36:12] but
[00:36:19] why not change the shield to basically
[00:36:22] an infinite shield in the form of damage
[00:36:24] resist by getting the Pyro resonance as
[00:36:26] well with day off so optimal team and
[00:36:29] then you do this with Xiao too
[00:36:31] conquering demons true
[00:36:34] true
[00:36:38] okay Jean Lee is good here right but he
[00:36:40] he loses value because you have milleth
[00:36:42] on farzan and you have so you don't need
[00:36:45] military and you have res shred from
[00:36:48] farzan so yeah more Russia is nice but
[00:36:50] it's not needed so you might as well
[00:36:52] just damn pie resonance for attack
[00:36:54] present
[00:36:58] true
[00:37:05] and oh my God let me cook for a second
[00:37:07] no no let me cook you go Wolf's
[00:37:10] gravestone
[00:37:11] to give your show 40 attack
[00:37:15] can John Lee do that
[00:37:18] kenshong Ken Shang Ling do that no she
[00:37:21] can't
[00:37:22] no she can't wolves gravestone day of
[00:37:26] support pyro resonance tanasia the
[00:37:29] milolith if you want
[00:37:30] res Interruption Wolf's Graystone
[00:37:41] don't worry about the uptime
[00:37:44] it's okay we can snapshot
[00:37:48] only snapshots if he says lament it's
[00:37:50] like a special property
[00:37:52] you have to be playing in English and he
[00:37:53] has to scream lament and then it'll
[00:37:55] snapshot
[00:37:59] why am I convinced I mean okay it's
[00:38:01] there's not bad and like okay like the
[00:38:05] other options better but like there's
[00:38:06] like okay
[00:38:10] like obviously you could just go
[00:38:12] channeling but like that's out of the
[00:38:13] equation
[00:38:27] hello LOL XD
[00:38:32] also dance prettier
[00:38:35] is you a lot better physical carry than
[00:38:36] Sue Chang uh it depends on the content
[00:38:43] for simulated Universe I like to shine
[00:38:45] because uh you could summon a big [ __ ]
[00:38:47] but for like Abyss
[00:38:50] you could use they offer resistance
[00:38:59] there's not prettier than Thomas oh I
[00:39:03] think that's debatable
[00:39:04] depends on what you inspire what you
[00:39:07] what you define as
[00:39:08] what your character or your criteria is
[00:39:19] Oh wait we're done
[00:39:24] they're both beautiful true
[00:39:27] wait why'd I just oh that's why
[00:39:39] I was like I have some [ __ ] up and I
[00:39:41] have to close
[00:39:48] yeah
[00:39:49] I wanted to make sure I'm not lagging
[00:39:52] if I like again I will mold
[00:39:57] add ass
[00:39:59] [Music]
[00:40:05] we've done the museum event no is it do
[00:40:07] I need to start it I haven't started it
[00:40:08] yet I saw there's like 40 days left so I
[00:40:10] was like whatever
[00:40:21] you gotta extended okay cool
[00:40:32] oh we should do this
[00:40:36] surely I won't do the museum event on
[00:40:38] the last day haha
[00:40:45] oh
[00:40:48] okay we should do the phase trials
[00:40:52] and divine Ingenuity but I don't need to
[00:40:54] do that now we have to speed on this
[00:40:55] okay okay we're speed running first of
[00:40:56] all let's go we need to ascend Kaya so
[00:40:58] we're gonna go do the crowd just fine
[00:40:59] twice because I'm gonna get Kai's level
[00:41:01] 90.
[00:41:04] because we're getting a skin
[00:41:07] and he's only level 80 right now
[00:41:13] so we're gonna send Kaya then we're
[00:41:15] gonna look at older or sorry newer
[00:41:17] characters that haven't really played
[00:41:18] too much to level and Ascend as well
[00:41:20] what dude why am I not pressing the
[00:41:21] right button I want a level
[00:41:23] Layla I think
[00:41:26] I want to use color but I don't need to
[00:41:27] level her for that we don't talk about
[00:41:29] Glee we don't talk about Amber
[00:41:31] probably Candace but I already
[00:41:32] pre-farmed her so well I have too many
[00:41:35] 12 was yeah I actually have too many
[00:41:37] Oh okay that's cool
[00:41:40] yeah we don't care about Dory
[00:41:42] no
[00:41:51] you got that charger 16-18 team build
[00:41:54] emblem on every single character you're
[00:41:55] welcome no blast on Bennett or
[00:41:58] instructor
[00:42:01] you can also go lava Walker you can also
[00:42:03] go two piece two piece
[00:42:05] but honestly you could just go emblem
[00:42:07] everything and you're chilling
[00:42:14] what weapon is cracked on kokomi hear me
[00:42:16] out okay you might not have this weapon
[00:42:18] so you can wait for kokomi's uh rerun
[00:42:21] and her weapon matter and when kokomi's
[00:42:23] weapon Banner is there what I want you
[00:42:24] to do is not pull on it and instead
[00:42:27] click on your kokomi and use the easily
[00:42:29] accessible uh thrilling Tales of Dragon
[00:42:31] Slayers which you can get to 90 for more
[00:42:33] HP and then use that on her
[00:42:36] all right Amber's supposed to be on
[00:42:38] Baidu I don't know why
[00:42:40] but my first time ever is not level
[00:42:42] maybe I should level it are the mats
[00:42:44] today wait I already have the
[00:42:46] of the mess
[00:42:48] what the [ __ ] did I not level it I
[00:42:50] thought it on the mats
[00:42:53] oh yeah the odd out in this game sucks
[00:42:55] okay I'm just gonna hold it
[00:43:07] it's very anime I haven't watched that
[00:43:09] many yet but I like Hunter Hunter I also
[00:43:11] like mob psycho a lot but I'm not done
[00:43:13] right I'm almost I'm not the last season
[00:43:16] foreign
[00:43:22] is Amber better than throwing Tails uh
[00:43:25] what do you mean by that no Oh you mean
[00:43:29] prototype Amber Oh I thought you meant
[00:43:31] the [ __ ] character
[00:43:32] I mean okay prototype ever in general is
[00:43:35] kind of mid but with baiju it's pretty
[00:43:37] good because baiju needs everything that
[00:43:39] it gives you which is a bunch of energy
[00:43:41] and some um some HP
[00:44:00] [Music]
[00:44:02] what
[00:44:04] you're right the song is a bit too emo
[00:44:06] for my mood
[00:44:27] by the way whoa why are you coming yo
[00:44:29] chill
[00:44:32] actually I like the part of this domain
[00:44:34] where you lose your energy it's pretty
[00:44:35] cool
[00:44:47] are you here to play with me
[00:44:58] uh okay how many do I need because I
[00:45:00] kind of like I don't need to 90 Amber we
[00:45:03] could use that like 80.
[00:45:07] yeah I need a lot never mind
[00:45:09] okay we'll do one
[00:45:19] No it should be enough
[00:45:24] all right
[00:45:26] their shots so different from mine he
[00:45:28] gets taller the more you play them uh
[00:45:30] every friendship level every
[00:45:31] constellation and every level so yeah
[00:45:34] that's why a lot of people have
[00:45:35] different experiences with their show so
[00:45:37] like make sure you invest into them
[00:45:40] that's why I like look when I'm when I
[00:45:42] like open my shower see how like you
[00:45:44] can't even see his legs because he's
[00:45:46] like so tall one but then I go to
[00:45:48] another character that people assume is
[00:45:49] tall like I'll hide them within like
[00:45:51] he's pretty tall but I can see all of
[00:45:52] him whereas when I go to Xiao it
[00:45:54] literally defaults to like not being
[00:45:56] able to see his legs so it's yeah
[00:45:58] it's only about like you get the more
[00:46:00] you play them so yeah
[00:46:03] um what did I want to do yeah
[00:46:05] that's
[00:46:08] like not everyone's Chao is there yet
[00:46:10] but keep [ __ ] grinding his friendship
[00:46:12] giving him crit damage criterate doesn't
[00:46:15] matter for that he only cares record
[00:46:16] damage and it should be fine
[00:46:34] uh baiju is here is he level 90 yeah
[00:46:38] basically
[00:46:44] I could probably get that if I use the
[00:46:46] the Pepe W boxes but I don't think I
[00:46:49] will
[00:46:57] dragged on top of your resin today dude
[00:46:59] I've streamed three times in like a day
[00:47:01] and a half I don't have time to re-regen
[00:47:03] resin
[00:47:10] is it okay to build yeah on baiju
[00:47:13] um
[00:47:14] what is your Bijou doing are you like
[00:47:16] blooming
[00:47:22] if you're just healing go HP and ER
[00:47:30] all right Chad what should we do wait I

[00:47:41] because we're a democracy here actually
[00:47:42] no we're not I [ __ ] I tell you guys
[00:47:44] what to do but
[00:47:45] for today's stream we're gonna be a
[00:47:47] democracy
[00:47:51] okay so we have we're gonna play Beto
[00:47:53] who I just knighted and I just crowned
[00:47:56] so Giga Chad

[00:47:59] gonna play Beto
[00:48:02] with
[00:48:07] yaimiko on field and then like
[00:48:11] dendro healer and then Animo
[00:48:14] no probably yeah yeah though
[00:48:16] either this
[00:48:18] or
[00:48:24] Beto with ayato
[00:48:26] cookie
[00:48:28] and nahida
[00:48:31] as just a hyperloom team
[00:48:39] both are good
[00:48:42] which am I playing
[00:48:44] ayato on field or yai Mikko on field do
[00:48:46] we have enough mode for both
[00:48:52] oh yeah we do so type toes for ayato or
[00:48:56] foreplay for yaimiko I don't know why
[00:48:58] that's I don't know why that's a remote
[00:49:00] I don't know
[00:49:01] but that's how you guys can vote
[00:49:14] um

[00:49:18] holy [ __ ]
[00:49:20] yeah it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] even
[00:49:26] with the foreplay censored for you what
[00:49:28] the [ __ ]
[00:49:29] why
[00:49:43] both we can't really do both honestly
[00:49:45] like we could do different halves but
[00:49:47] and one team would be like we can't do
[00:49:48] beta and the eye and ayato
[00:50:12] we do this though
[00:50:17] wait what are the enemies oh yeah
[00:50:19] actually I know that nevermind but
[00:50:22] yeah they would both work and we could
[00:50:23] do both
[00:50:27] do a poll no the numbers lie emotes
[00:50:31] don't I just judged how many emotes I
[00:50:33] saw
[00:50:48] yeah it is but I chose the wrong
[00:50:50] characters are our [ __ ] hyperloom
[00:50:52] team is nahira kuki I just I don't know
[00:50:53] what I was clicking I don't even
[00:50:54] remember what I clicked but it's
[00:50:56] supposed to be nahida cookie which is
[00:50:57] enough
[00:50:59] hello Mr socks my first time I get to
[00:51:01] join your stream please please do
[00:51:04] yourself a favor and evacuate please
[00:51:07] please
[00:51:12] don't don't don't
[00:51:14] suffer the same fate that I did also why
[00:51:17] do I have so many light books
[00:51:22] there's level nine this I'm missing one
[00:51:24] [ __ ] handguard
[00:51:29] whatever
[00:51:31] all right yeah Miko is geared
[00:51:35] Beto is geared
[00:51:40] a bit low ER for yai but we're running
[00:51:44] running yay
[00:51:46] casual
[00:51:50] and then probably Yao
[00:52:00] yeah I should be on fav yeah
[00:52:10] Bulls
[00:52:15] yeah we should be chilling
[00:52:17] um
[00:52:18] where's Caldwell how much does he have
[00:52:20] 160 166.
[00:52:23] let's see one hour chilling all right
[00:52:25] second half we're gonna play
[00:52:29] okay Chad be honest because I haven't
[00:52:31] played it yet so please be honest with
[00:52:34] me when I ask this okay be honest with
[00:52:36] me how copium on a scale of one to ten
[00:52:40] one being
[00:52:42] not copium at all and 10 being the most
[00:52:44] copium would be to play full Geo second
[00:52:48] half
[00:52:50] just be honest I'm here
[00:52:52] be honest with me
[00:53:03] I did
[00:53:10] how are you gonna destroy the shields
[00:53:12] with Geo
[00:53:14] we probably want Bennett for the um to
[00:53:16] help a bit but
[00:53:23] like this
[00:53:32] I mean I'm not to try it
[00:53:34] like I've heard a lot of people say it's
[00:53:36] like they've done it with Geo so I I
[00:53:38] know it's possible but
[00:53:43] but we don't have a shield in this team
[00:53:45] well we have crystallized so I guess we
[00:53:46] do but I'm saying like John Lee would be
[00:53:47] more comfy maybe strongly over Albedo
[00:53:50] because if it's pillar resonant
[00:53:52] resonates then like it's fine it'll hit
[00:53:54] the [ __ ]
[00:54:03] where's the Geo chatter yeah he's not
[00:54:05] here right now
[00:54:06] he's missing the best content of his
[00:54:08] life
[00:54:09] I honestly think you know what's funny
[00:54:11] though every time I don't play a
[00:54:13] character for a while their build gets
[00:54:15] [ __ ] like I don't remember the last
[00:54:16] time I played [ __ ] I don't know like
[00:54:18] Mona so if I look at her build it's kind
[00:54:20] of [ __ ] but a character like a Geo
[00:54:23] character their builds don't get [ __ ]
[00:54:24] touched so my ethos still on a good set
[00:54:28] like I'm sure that if I oh he already
[00:54:29] has red horn like I'm yeah my like my
[00:54:31] ethos are already chilling because the
[00:54:33] joke like like who the [ __ ] is gonna
[00:54:35] take husk
[00:54:37] we just need a bit more crate
[00:54:40] marito's unironically good though
[00:54:42] maita's actually very good
[00:54:50] I I actually think I have like low key
[00:54:54] I think I Loki have better husk than I
[00:54:57] have uh uh Vermilion
[00:55:00] and I probably spent one 100 000 of the
[00:55:03] resin no 100th not 100 like I probably
[00:55:05] spent like 1K resin in in or like 5K I
[00:55:08] think if it's like 5K and then okay
[00:55:10] probably what 5K out of 100K so five
[00:55:13] percent
[00:55:16] well
[00:55:20] uh we might want a bit more create
[00:55:23] [Music]
[00:55:25] it was 2K for the video wait really
[00:55:29] Ito resin ziox
[00:55:34] well done I thought this video did bad
[00:55:35] as 800k what the [ __ ] wait man I should
[00:55:37] make another yo Fontana we're gonna do
[00:55:39] wait what yo I look 12. what the [ __ ]
[00:55:46] it is
[00:55:47] um
[00:55:49] yo I look so much younger what the [ __ ]
[00:55:54] um wait
[00:55:56] I spent 2K resin what's my build at the
[00:55:58] end
[00:56:00] should I show it
[00:56:03] years
[00:56:06] yeah I ain't watching all this bro
[00:56:08] this is where I'm invested okay
[00:56:11] okay
[00:56:12] oh I'm gonna be bad and then you just
[00:56:14] get medium rolls and you keep loving
[00:56:16] it's good for crowd characters because
[00:56:17] if we're gonna be happy Honestly by this
[00:56:20] domain for like two weeks straight now
[00:56:24] taste my resources on all right well

[00:57:02] our defense can be higher though
[00:57:04] but it is what it is
[00:57:07] um
[00:57:08] I mean I might have like a like this is
[00:57:10] like
[00:57:11] I might have a crit rate crit damage
[00:57:13] piece with defense like this one
[00:57:23] yo what the [ __ ] is this
[00:57:26] this is perfect
[00:57:28] but then I would need to go SS
[00:57:31] I don't want to though I'm not gonna do
[00:57:32] this but like
[00:57:34] wait this is actually pretty good
[00:57:36] that's actually really good

[00:58:18] he's okay he has a lot of Defense he's
[00:58:20] chilling right he's chilling yeah he's
[00:58:21] chilling I probably got a better defense
[00:58:23] than though
[00:58:24] since then because this is a while ago
[00:58:26] so I probably have a better one
[00:58:28] um

[01:02:21] right now
[01:02:24] nothing lasts forever
[01:02:26] emerge right here
[01:02:41] the wind smells
[01:02:45] like it was a fine clear like everything
[01:02:48] [ __ ] up but we still got it in a
[01:02:49] minute but I would never you I would
[01:02:52] rather be I would rather be I would
[01:02:54] rather be found I would I would rather
[01:02:57] only play Dale for the rest of my life
[01:02:59] then include that in a video so we're
[01:03:01] gonna redo it because it was like a pyro
[01:03:04] swirl Beto team like it wasn't even bad
[01:03:06] it wasn't even bad but like if I put
[01:03:09] that in an electro aggravate showcase
[01:03:11] where I'm swirling pyro what the [ __ ] am
[01:03:13] I doing
[01:03:15] you aren't using normals I was using
[01:03:17] normals in between while I was swapping
[01:03:18] characters but like sometimes you have
[01:03:20] to like hold e on Cosmo and [ __ ] so it's
[01:03:22] like you kind of can't sometimes
[01:03:23] but also usually with beta you play
[01:03:26] sucrose and then you unfield her but
[01:03:27] also I want to unfill the eye but also
[01:03:30] you can't do normal rotations against
[01:03:32] small enemies and waves of enemies
[01:03:33] because like let's say you do a perfect
[01:03:35] rotation but then you kill the enemy
[01:03:37] like like it's wasted it's wasted so you
[01:03:39] have to like there's like consume and
[01:03:41] adapt it's like improvise
[01:03:44] right now
[01:03:45] Inc right now

[01:04:56] what are those swords around you okay I
[01:04:58] [ __ ] I'll explain it these are
[01:04:59] serpent spine sacks when you have a
[01:05:00] sermon spine you can put the service
[01:05:01] mind character in your first slot and
[01:05:03] then wait till it stops a five and then
[01:05:04] you start fully stacked so the pass was
[01:05:06] always maxed unless you take damage
[01:05:08] I'm gonna try something where I don't
[01:05:11] actually group them I don't actually
[01:05:13] group them and then I swirl them all
[01:05:15] together
[01:05:20] right now
[01:05:21] okay that actually low-key work better
[01:05:32] someone in chat typed I'd kiss Beto's
[01:05:34] feet and then one of my mods typed based
[01:05:37] okay listen listen well listen okay
[01:05:40] listen while I'm not going to either I'm
[01:05:44] not going to agree or disagree I'm just
[01:05:46] concerned about the fact that you typed
[01:05:48] Bass
[01:05:55] yeah
[01:05:57] right here
[01:06:01] [Music]
[01:06:10] I was trying to get a Parry because I'm
[01:06:12] like if I'm gonna make this if this is
[01:06:14] gonna be back on footage in a beta video
[01:06:15] I'm waiting to get a Perry but then the
[01:06:17] [ __ ] mechanical [ __ ] were just
[01:06:19] like standing there just literally
[01:06:21] standing not hitting me what could I do
[01:06:26] okay can't wait to reset this because
[01:06:28] jail but we got this
[01:06:30] also bear with me if there's any like
[01:06:33] hardcore geoman in chat I haven't played
[01:06:34] this Geo team in a while so like excuse
[01:06:37] any discrepancies Lucas is that 40
[01:06:39] months correi things in two months
[01:06:42] okay
[01:06:48] teamwork
[01:06:49] I dodged I literally they got frozen
[01:06:52] during the Dodge animation
[01:07:12] is not that low
[01:07:15] wait my [ __ ] bro my bro's on five
[01:07:17] everybody
[01:07:23] can I create one hit in my life
[01:07:27] okay
[01:07:31] um
[01:07:57] okay Chad I don't know how to say this
[01:07:59] nicely okay
[01:08:00] I think this is my fault not the teams
[01:08:02] but uh there is no way in the ever
[01:08:05] loving [ __ ] that we're getting
[01:08:07] we're getting through this
[01:08:16] bro are you
[01:08:24] coming through
[01:08:26] yeah
[01:08:49] first point moments of birth
[01:08:52] [Applause]
[01:08:53] stop
[01:08:54] please
[01:08:58] wait so why don't they just play you do
[01:09:00] a first half
[01:09:02] first point
[01:09:06] use tank paper Shield break honestly I
[01:09:08] could we don't need Bennett in this team
[01:09:11] I just want to try Bennett but that's
[01:09:12] actually not even a bad idea
[01:09:17] who wants some of this
[01:09:25] yeah maybe we replaced Bennett but like
[01:09:27] I'm not gonna reset it doesn't matter
[01:09:30] I got energy here
[01:09:37] doesn't matter we're just doing this for
[01:09:38] the first half clear anyways but
[01:09:40] yeah maybe we I mean now I know maybe
[01:09:42] last thought shouldn't be Bennett
[01:09:43] because the damage doesn't really matter
[01:09:44] it's like Shield break right so like
[01:09:46] yeah Bennett gives you attack which like
[01:09:48] is still good for you though like it's
[01:09:49] still good but like we'd probably rather
[01:09:51] have a shield break
[01:09:55] okay
[01:09:56] um
[01:09:58] I need to actually hit a Parry here so
[01:09:59] if I miss the first Parry I'm resetting
[01:10:01] I don't have energy what the [ __ ] okay
[01:10:03] well Perry's gonna help with that
[01:10:07] please
[01:10:10] bro hit me
[01:10:14] okay I'll just use my skill at the start
[01:10:16] I there's no point in waiting it's
[01:10:18] actually just uh it's stupid to wait
[01:10:19] literally it's the why would I wait
[01:10:24] I'll just use my skill and Beto
[01:10:26] instantly then swapped and go back
[01:10:27] tomato then Perry agree agree
[01:10:39] swap
[01:10:48] get in
[01:10:59] thank you
[01:11:02] right now
[01:11:09] put right here right now
[01:11:15] there's one with wind and Cloud
[01:11:20] s
[01:11:22] right here emerge right now
[01:11:28] we might as well just wait now there's
[01:11:30] no point using bursts here
[01:11:33] watch I'll get the pair here watch watch
[01:11:42] nice Beto gameplay it actually was you
[01:11:43] want to know why because we managed to
[01:11:45] clear the worst situation for beta which
[01:11:47] is a single Target enemy with a team
[01:11:49] that's meant for AOE which means the
[01:11:51] team is still very performing very well
[01:11:53] in the one chamber where it's not meant
[01:11:55] to perform
[01:11:56] also single Target Beto teams are also
[01:11:59] fine because Beto doesn't perform by one
[01:12:00] single Target but you could just go sing
[01:12:02] show yolan boom guess what or [ __ ]
[01:12:04] sucrose beta official
[01:12:07] boom yeah official yeah
[01:12:11] okay what is second half it is the dudes
[01:12:16] oh it's the bird it's a bird
[01:12:33] yo what the [ __ ] is this way
[01:12:40] okay well well I don't know what the
[01:12:44] [ __ ] just happened so uh
[01:12:47] okay
[01:12:58] dude what the [ __ ] is that I feel like
[01:13:01] I've had that glitch happen before but
[01:13:03] it's been so long
[01:13:05] laughs
[01:13:08] yeah let's roll
[01:13:11] let's light it up that's [ __ ] funny I
[01:13:15] don't know why better just did the
[01:13:17] Albedo
[01:13:20] then it no don't nuke monster
[01:13:31] only coming through
[01:13:34] attaboy
[01:13:36] now I have to start with no energy why
[01:13:38] did I do that I don't know but I feel
[01:13:40] like every time I say my burst against
[01:13:41] the bird it goes terrible so I was like
[01:13:42] [ __ ] it all right 12-3
[01:13:46] um
[01:13:47] I'll take the ER
[01:13:57] that show is funny I want to watch that
[01:13:59] again
[01:14:01] okay ready chat we're gonna do wait
[01:14:02] these are the two dudes okay this is
[01:14:04] where we should perform so we can
[01:14:05] actually do an actual rotation here
[01:14:06] we're gonna do yai and uh
[01:14:11] Cosmo burst is 15 seconds so he probably
[01:14:14] shouldn't cause a burst before Beto
[01:14:15] bursts so we should probably do yai
[01:14:17] apply dendro Beto
[01:14:20] swirl every like we could also swirl
[01:14:22] before but at least cause of Earth after
[01:14:25] then just like spam rotate okay cool
[01:14:35] I need to proc Constructor okay then we
[01:14:37] swirl
[01:14:38] can we battle
[01:14:41] wait wrong character
[01:14:52] there's no way danger there's no dendro
[01:14:54] there's no dendro oh my God

[01:22:43] a little bit if I chilled a little bit
[01:22:44] it would have worked I needed to chill

[01:22:52] thank you thanks Chad
[01:22:56] what if I go right side
[01:22:59] right now left side right side you are
[01:23:02] King
[01:23:08] now this guy just starts [ __ ] dancing
[01:23:09] oh yeah it's dumb
[01:23:19] wait my skillet
[01:23:21] I did my burst was on an eight second
[01:23:23] cooldown what do you want me to do what
[01:23:24] do you want me to do
[01:23:27] hey we can't clear first try and the
[01:23:29] point is to get a
[01:23:32] I just don't want to clear with like a
[01:23:33] minute left well I probably will because
[01:23:34] I guess the first time's harder but
[01:23:36] still
[01:23:39] okay
[01:23:42] I know but like
[01:23:44] I know you're supposed to go here but I
[01:23:45] don't know it's just been like copium
[01:23:47] so I was trying something different
[01:24:01] right now right here right now
[01:24:05] wait this is actually good
[01:24:11] emerge
[01:24:18] right here right now
[01:24:31] time reset yeah yeah it's a mental reset
[01:24:34] yeah it was a mental reset did I just
[01:24:35] plunge attack right here
[01:24:38] emerge right now
[01:24:56] emerge
[01:24:59] okay one with nature

[01:25:17] I mean it's still fine we can still
[01:25:19] clear but like
[01:25:23] that was so good and then yeah I just
[01:25:25] died
[01:25:42] baiju would have been better because
[01:25:46] even if it's Shield is paper thin his
[01:25:48] skill heals everyone and for you for
[01:25:50] Yaya his her burst does but it's like
[01:25:52] more annoying to burst and her skill
[01:25:54] only heals when you're on field and
[01:25:55] being on field on yai you die
[01:26:00] don't be scared
[01:26:07] right here
[01:26:13] nothing lasts forever right now emerge

[01:34:34] foreign
[01:34:58] 's Paradise 2 coming out
[01:35:15] foreign
[01:35:21] character that could use Gambler maybe
[01:35:23] like
[01:35:24] um
[01:35:24] skill damage you know you could put this
[01:35:26] on like
[01:35:27] uh
[01:35:39] folklore maybe whatever color skill
[01:35:41] summons a hydro tortoise who's like I'm
[01:35:43] a tortoise and then shoots tortoise
[01:35:45] Bubbles at you huh
[01:35:54] child child doesn't do skill damage
[01:35:56] though
[01:36:20] when are we getting a sack pull up
[01:36:25] Mick okay look
[01:36:28] it could be good I know it's defense
[01:36:31] defense HP but it could get crit damage
[01:36:34] it good
[01:36:38] I'm gonna level it to four
[01:36:42] dude it could I remember my child's
[01:36:46] circlet
[01:36:47] okay well this one yeah but still like
[01:36:49] this is good and it has HP HP defense
[01:36:51] you hear me so like
[01:36:53] Why Can't This one be like that
[01:36:56] you're not gonna call this piece trash
[01:36:58] so why would you call why would you call
[01:37:01] this one trash
[01:37:05] you have to level child basic facts no
[01:37:10] unless you do like aim shot to apply
[01:37:12] Riptide it's just yeah you got like six
[01:37:15] but no you don't need to
[01:37:28] yeah well it was worth a shot
[01:37:46] yeah pretty good there rotation I think
[01:37:49] it's probably optimal
[01:37:55] that's pretty good
[01:37:57] we did our N1 J n1j and then you lament
[01:38:01] on ciao
[01:38:03] like the optimal let's get accurate
[01:38:04] damage but uh no actually it's a little
[01:38:07] not worth
[01:38:15] can you clear second half of this in the
[01:38:16] Hira Central oppa Bennett that was the
[01:38:18] first team I did
[01:38:20] well the first thing I did was with
[01:38:21] Tomah and we were one second off and
[01:38:22] then I changed I could have done it but
[01:38:23] I changed to shangling and then we did
[01:38:25] it we did it's just yeah rational
[01:38:30] like I would recommend that team for
[01:38:32] second half right now because it's all
[01:38:33] the elements you need because you kind
[01:38:35] of want dendron you kind of want pyro so
[01:38:37] and you want Hydro for the last dude
[01:38:39] whatever his name is the fatherless
[01:38:40] flames
[01:38:52] what do we play Final Fantasy very soon
[01:38:54] very soon very soon very soon very soon
[01:38:55] I'm really hyped that would do that we
[01:38:57] beat the demo last stream it was so
[01:38:58] [ __ ] sick so now the full game's out
[01:39:00] so we get to play that I'm excited
[01:39:05] stop talking four stars you need help
[01:39:07] okay if I if I know that I need help why
[01:39:10] won't I check more artifacts for a
[01:39:12] higher chance of help
[01:39:18] all right we're done with Vermillion
[01:39:21] that's a sign
[01:39:29] we're gonna go Ascend our Kaya to 90.
[01:39:33] foreign
[01:39:48] because he deserves it
[01:40:03] [Music]
[01:40:11] uh let me change for friendship I might
[01:40:13] as well
[01:40:17] what is this damage I have no burst so
[01:40:19] you want me to do
[01:40:22] well I don't have a friendship team uh
[01:40:25] chat what's our friendship you gonna
[01:40:26] look like let's do
[01:40:34] Cafe
[01:40:36] who's new
[01:40:46] let me double check our equipment let me
[01:40:50] double check our equipment
[01:40:53] his final French of 10 yeah
[01:40:59] okay he will be
[01:41:00] okay
[01:41:02] well at least we got more from that we
[01:41:04] just get more that's fine
[01:41:05] also yeah let's get tomorrow
[01:41:10] we have to save our five stars the font
[01:41:12] that comes out because if there's a new
[01:41:13] strong box I want to sack everything to
[01:41:14] the new strong box whatever it is
[01:41:22] we good
[01:41:24] nice we have 20.
[01:41:27] all right so in theory arcaya should be
[01:41:30] able to be ascended
[01:41:33] yeah we just need uh golden Raven and
[01:41:35] six of those so we need what third 11
[01:41:37] more 11.
[01:41:39] I know let me just
[01:41:44] we level clear because of skin maybe I
[01:41:47] definitely want to get the skin I should
[01:41:49] probably play her if I get this game
[01:41:50] yeah I guess
[01:41:57] we'll see I don't know
[01:42:03] I remember back in the day when she got
[01:42:05] our first rerun I learned Oliver like
[01:42:07] Optimal like charge attack cancel combos
[01:42:09] but I forgot all of them like I learned
[01:42:11] how to like like I learned that like I
[01:42:13] kind of still remember the timing I got
[01:42:15] all remember like I learned like the
[01:42:16] optimal Combos and I forgot them
[01:42:27] machine gun isn't that the spamming
[01:42:29] spamming like how do you wait wait you
[01:42:32] do like
[01:42:33] how do you

[01:42:48] wait no no I you can't spam click double
[01:42:49] your it [ __ ] it up
[01:42:53] okay but whoever actively chooses to
[01:42:55] play like this is a sociopath like I
[01:42:58] want to make like you should be on like
[01:42:59] a list
[01:43:02] oh can you just hold
[01:43:03] oh okay this is easier okay that's a lot
[01:43:06] easier

[01:52:27] time I played it was on stream I topped
[01:52:30] up as like a sub goal for whatever the
[01:52:31] [ __ ] we were doing and then I haven't
[01:52:33] logged in since so I literally just
[01:52:35] spent money and then did not log in that
[01:52:38] was like the first waste of like okay
[01:52:40] genjen is like it's not a waste because
[01:52:42] it's content okay but like that one was

[01:52:49] okay last one no more
[01:53:05] who still plays that someone in chat
[01:53:06] apparently
[01:53:07] hey I mean it was fun while it lasted
[01:53:10] that's fine
[01:53:12] yes
[01:53:22] yes
[01:53:33] did people call every game a gunshin
[01:53:35] killer though
[01:53:40] I love gention
[01:53:41] do you know what also love other than
[01:53:43] genjin

[01:53:47] smhr Final Fantasy scene you could
[01:53:49] actually download the game uh on
[01:53:51] PlayStation 5 from the store if you
[01:53:53] click my link you can download it or you
[01:53:55] can play the demo for free on the store
[01:53:56] that is pretty cool I actually can't
[01:53:58] wait to play the games Alex yeah so now
[01:54:01] smooth transition into uh today's game
[01:54:04] Final Fantasy
[01:54:08] oh wait why am I full
[01:54:10] I clicked the wrong scene shows use the
[01:54:12] Gin sock things with Prime
[01:54:15] let me change really quickly the game
[01:54:17] and the title
[01:54:21] because I think we both know what time
[01:54:23] it is
[01:54:25] and this time it won't be stopped
[01:54:27] because it my settings this time I set
[01:54:28] up off stream
[01:54:31] I actually did variety for once I
[01:54:34] actually set everything up we're [ __ ]
[01:54:36] ready
[01:54:36] but let me put everything I'm gonna make
[01:54:38] my monitor
[01:54:39] that
[01:54:45] come out yeah command works there's a
[01:54:46] cooldown though there's a small cooldown
[01:54:48] to avoid spam but uh the command works
[01:55:02] okay
[01:55:06] what does your background look like a
[01:55:07] horror movie set
[01:55:09] it doesn't
[01:55:12] anyways I'm excited to play this game
[01:55:13] again because last time was super
[01:55:14] [ __ ] fun it's I really enjoyed it so
[01:55:16] I'm hyped also I'm gonna say it now so I
[01:55:19] don't forget
[01:55:25] variety content is coming thank you I'm
[01:55:28] gonna thanks obviously Square Enix
[01:55:30] sponsored us which is [ __ ] insane so
[01:55:32] thanks to them uh let me switch I don't
[01:55:35] know how to use a PlayStation so bear
[01:55:37] with me well that's not true but I don't
[01:55:38] know how to stream it so this might be a
[01:55:40] little scuffed for like two seconds so
[01:55:42] just bear with me as we progress these
[01:55:45] changes I didn't do my stereo dailies
[01:55:48] foreign
[01:55:52] I'm opening my phone
[01:55:59] okay
[01:56:01] let me do that
[01:56:03] so in theory this should work once I
[01:56:05] chat I'm opening my PlayStation
[01:56:09] Bala station
[01:56:12] where is it
[01:56:13] one moment please oh it works
[01:56:19] but if I start gonna continue that's
[01:56:20] pretty it's pretty fun it's pretty good
[01:56:21] hiker damage and then em is this not bad
[01:56:23] because it converts
[01:56:33] okay
[01:56:34] that works
[01:56:35] wait do you guys are gonna hear double
[01:56:36] for a second let me fix it
[01:56:41] should be fine now
[01:56:44] I don't know how to adjust the volume
[01:56:46] though so if it's like loud or not loud
[01:56:48] I don't know how to oh wait I know how
[01:56:51] oh okay I see it I see it
[01:57:00] [Music]
[01:57:01] wait I just removed my webcam
[01:57:09] wait why is it cutting my head out
[01:57:12] I know I look short
[01:57:16] I still look short but it's fine
[01:57:20] finally
[01:57:23] it pause my music
[01:57:27] okay so last time we played the demo it
[01:57:29] was sick now we're gonna play the full
[01:57:31] game continuing from where we left off
[01:57:34] and my settings there won't be any
[01:57:36] library though there shouldn't be
[01:57:37] because I actually fixed my settings
[01:57:38] this time last time I wasn't the Game
[01:57:40] Swap was my fault
[01:57:41] so now this should work and I can change
[01:57:43] my monitor to this because I was playing
[01:57:44] on like the M the um
[01:57:46] capture card thingy
[01:57:50] why am I so Square why is my face cam
[01:57:52] scuffed I think it's fine
[01:58:01] so important things I want to say just
[01:58:03] so I don't forget so that we can move
[01:58:05] past this and play with the game first
[01:58:07] of all to all of you wondering you can

[02:28:56] I didn't know it was her
[02:28:59] how could it be
[02:29:01] and so to save her neck you slit your

[02:56:21] look at this
[02:56:23] uh where the [ __ ] is it
[02:56:27] like complex ability combinations can be
[02:56:29] executed by just pressing Square I feel
[02:56:31] like it's just some like it's cool if
[02:56:33] you just want to chill and do the story
[02:56:34] but like I feel like I just like
[02:56:36] yeah it's like for quality of life so
[02:56:39] like I kind of don't want to do I want
[02:56:40] to keep the game kind of hard I do think
[02:56:41] having more money might be cool just
[02:56:43] because why not
[02:56:44] but like these I probably don't want
[02:56:47] like I'm down for the game to be hard
[02:56:49] like I'm down to like [ __ ] have to
[02:56:52] like die a few times
[02:56:55] yeah
[02:56:57] uh I'm not for more Jill though I feel
[02:56:59] like it'd be cool to just buy stuff but
[02:57:01] other than that
[02:57:03] foreign
[02:57:13] dude I'm literally the god gamer
[02:57:16] literally every game I touch I got it
[02:57:21] do I have to remind you of my resume
[02:57:23] wait how to use my dog wait so
[02:57:26] oh hopefully he can't get hurt till I'll
[02:57:29] be sad
[02:57:35] and then

[02:57:42] well that's [ __ ] sick
[02:57:49] okay this is
[02:58:00] [Music]
[02:58:01] killing dude they're wargans they're not
[02:58:04] dogs
[02:58:06] look at him chilling good boy
[02:58:10] oh
[02:58:14] okay this is the best game ever oh my
[02:58:17] God this is actually the best game ever
[02:58:18] wait can I do it again
[02:58:21] [Music]
[02:58:25] wait I fed him
[02:58:27] [Music]
[02:58:30] oh my God wait there's actually wait why
[02:58:31] won't it
[02:58:35] okay yeah game of the year
[02:58:39] that's [ __ ] sick okay I'm happy
[02:58:41] that was actually [ __ ] sick
[02:58:42] but I have to do it again
[02:58:44] [Music]
[02:58:48] I don't feel good boy
[02:58:50] um
[02:58:55] I'm buying a console to pet the dog
[02:58:58] yeah that's pretty based
[02:59:16] what the [ __ ] is that that is not a dog
[02:59:20] it's kind of a dog
[02:59:22] I think we could pet that
[02:59:32] [ __ ] good griega's name is he doing
[02:59:34] this for ourselves oh you pet a dog IRL
[02:59:36] did I haven't forever no more wolves
[02:59:39] where he's from no one here I asked
[02:59:41] about in the first parts
[02:59:46] of course odd I'd invite him over a cup
[02:59:49] of tea if I didn't think you'd eat the
[02:59:50] dog I had to fight one of them
[02:59:56] [Music]
[03:00:00] get a dog okay here's my philosophy I
[03:00:03] know for sure I know for a fact I want
[03:00:06] to get a dog and or a cat in the future
[03:00:08] but I don't think I'm ready for it
[03:00:10] because if I can't
[03:00:12] if I'm okay listen I don't think I'm
[03:00:14] responsible enough for my own life so I
[03:00:16] don't want to have another dependent
[03:00:18] creature like I don't have a pet if I
[03:00:20] don't think I'm responsible enough so
[03:00:22] like I'm kind of waiting so I have my
[03:00:23] [ __ ] straight up
[03:00:26] like I said like two hours like four
[03:00:29] hours outside
[03:00:38] figure it out
[03:00:44] now how do I do my thing that I'm trying
[03:00:45] to do oh it's on slow down that's fine
[03:00:47] oh no I was pressing the wrong button
[03:00:49] okay so it's triangles again that's why
[03:00:55] what's up
[03:01:04] the weird part about the burning sword
[03:01:06] command is it's the same button as a
[03:01:08] attack so like whenever I attack I feel
[03:01:10] you have to like attack first before you
[03:01:12] can charge it it's kind of weird because
[03:01:14] I wish I could just like charge it
[03:01:29] [Music]
[03:01:35] but it sounds like pretty sure I'm 14
[03:01:38] and then someone replies La Mao real
[03:01:41] it's not real
[03:01:55] the ruins
[03:01:57] they're everywhere aren't they
[03:02:04] some say there was a time they blocked
[03:02:06] out the Stars
[03:02:08] down was the only way left for them to
[03:02:10] go
[03:02:12] there's probably a lesson to be learned
[03:02:14] from that
[03:02:15] early can wait come on
[03:02:18] that's cool oh [ __ ] I just realized it's
[03:02:21] gonna die every cool character is gonna
[03:02:23] die every time there's a character I
[03:02:26] like because like the homie he just dies
[03:02:27] so no spot doesn't trap either but like
[03:02:30] I don't want to get too attached I'm
[03:02:31] afraid
[03:02:32] oh no it's fine at least we have a dog
[03:02:37] response
[03:02:47] that thing's kind of cool
[03:02:49] well it's only a lot of Boss
[03:02:56] I keep pressing [ __ ] um
[03:03:01] wait so
[03:03:07] [Music]
[03:03:10] how is it that I forget the controls to
[03:03:12] do each combat
[03:03:15] wait why is that thing not thinking R2
[03:03:18] Square
[03:03:20] wait
[03:03:21] am I stupid whatever
[03:03:24] holy Shadow cool down okay I didn't know
[03:03:28] they share to cool down because like
[03:03:30] there's two like I could do I could do
[03:03:33] this
[03:03:34] or I could do the other one well you can
[03:03:36] do both but they don't turn
[03:03:39] I don't want to talk about it they don't
[03:03:40] charge it on they're just both on
[03:03:41] cooldowns and [ __ ] I don't know
[03:03:43] so why isn't it charging
[03:03:54] foreign
[03:04:36] well it appears we won't be going this
[03:04:39] way no why not it's just a [ __ ] tree
[03:04:43] I'll admit I haven't counted on that
[03:04:45] this kind of looks like a boss fight
[03:04:48] like do you ever just like never just
[03:04:50] feel that a boss fight is coming when
[03:04:52] you like walk into like
[03:04:53] a giant pit what is it boy
[03:04:58] wait animal well I didn't read that

[03:05:26] dog

[03:24:03] scene with the kids unfortunately you uh
[03:24:06] you just missed it out of all the rest
[03:24:07] and you won't come we'll watch it later

[03:24:18] the thing is you don't strike me as a
[03:24:21] liar
[03:24:25] which leaves but one person who might be
[03:24:27] able to shed some light on the matter
[03:24:30] and they're in a lost swing
[03:24:34] last win
[03:24:37] as I would imagine

[03:42:27] Cornerstone teachering on the backs of a
[03:42:30] handful of cowards and cut throats
[03:42:35] while Bahamut may lead a hundred full

[03:43:27] foreign

[03:44:32] I was kind of standing asleep
[03:44:42] can novent one of the Empire's outline
[03:44:45] strongholds though apparently not strong
[03:44:47] enough to keep out the royalists the
[03:44:49] captured bearers are inside
[03:44:51] I'm sure of it I'm sure the daughters
[03:44:55] are to stay in the shadows she won't be
[03:44:57] traveling with many men meaning she'll
[03:44:59] be keeping her prisoners together and
[03:45:01] close by including the dominant
[03:45:04] so we find a way into the fall down
[03:45:06] abysmal yeah I usually think Chad is a
[03:45:09] reflection of the streamer but I'm not
[03:45:10] down bad at all so I don't know what the

[03:49:40] your little sanctuary
[03:49:42] [Music]
[03:49:44] I would never have guessed so many
[03:49:46] people were bent on setting us free

[03:49:49] when last I checked the mere thought
[03:49:52] would only would trip to the Gallows
[03:49:55] I am well aware of the risks as I am of
[03:49:58] the rewards
[03:50:00] why are you talking like that
[03:50:03] and what could be more rewarding than
[03:50:04] your very own dominant of Fire
[03:50:07] a dominant here
[03:50:09] now that I would like to see
[03:50:14] meaning you haven't

[03:50:35] you how they will greet the inquiries of
[03:50:37] a bearer
[03:50:39] you are afraid your words will fall on
[03:50:44] deaf ears
[03:50:46] as they have ever since the moment you
[03:50:50] were marked
[03:50:56] happily I can provide a solution to your

[03:54:11] Refuge here

[03:54:16] but I do seem to recall one in commanded
[03:54:19] the flight

[03:54:21] dominant I can't say
[03:54:24] the willudas certainly took a keen
[03:54:25] interest in the pool sod

[03:56:30] Channel or a variety day and then boom
[03:56:32] it only gets better yeah honestly I
[03:56:34] believe that I've been thinking if our
[03:56:36] friend is a dominant why not just burn
[03:56:38] I'm a dominant hey there's a reason he's
[03:56:41] holding back and I reckon he has
[03:56:43] something to do with his partner what
[03:56:46] makes you say that
[03:56:47] one of the villages I taught so you're
[03:56:49] not having fun I'll give up only if you
[03:56:51] follow
[03:56:51] I'm desperate I'm desperate it's like to
[03:56:54] think twice before starting any fires
[03:56:56] whoever he is well he said this Vibe
[03:56:58] somewhere that's not a bad idea level
[03:56:59] ahead he's careful cunning and he
[03:57:03] doesn't want to be found
[03:57:04] like me I'm careful
[03:57:07] Frozen the royalist both
[03:57:10] huh

[03:57:18] pallets waiting for his back of the Year

[04:04:01] I got my head in a box
[04:04:03] but this isn't just about dominance and
[04:04:05] bear as it's about all of us
[04:04:08] what I want
[04:04:10] is to build a place where it doesn't
[04:04:11] matter what you are but who you are
[04:04:14] pretty cool
[04:04:19] ready for a place like that
[04:04:24] so until it is I use the power I've been
[04:04:27] given to show people there is hope
[04:04:34] very cool

[04:06:53] with each passing day you're just
[04:06:56] starved of The Ether that gives it life
[04:06:58] and as the fringes fade the people flock
[04:07:01] to the mother Crystal's desperate for
[04:07:04] their blessing
[04:07:06] War we wage for possession of that
[04:07:09] blessing
[04:07:10] breaks us from within hastening us to
[04:07:14] our own destruction
[04:07:16] so you do what must be done
[04:07:19] I unite the dominance
[04:07:22] that we may bring an end to the strife
[04:07:24] and found a new order to see us unto

[04:21:15] yeah I don't know it would like make it
[04:21:17] too easy I think

[04:21:29] we just killed someone here okay I'm
[04:21:31] going back
[04:21:41] wait didn't I just come from there
[04:21:49] okay we're gonna
[04:21:52] go back here maybe that enemy was just a
[04:21:56] coincidence like that the corpse
[04:21:58] coincidence
[04:22:00] wait we were literally just here
[04:22:10] I think it's this way
[04:22:13] maybe like maybe we like

[04:22:20] to go here
[04:22:29] map isn't opening by the way oh wait

[04:22:44] came from here no

[04:22:50] that's the right place
[04:22:54] wait no yeah we came from here okay wait
