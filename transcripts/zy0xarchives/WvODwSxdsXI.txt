[00:17:50] it's going to be like whatever I tried
[00:17:52] farming for finina no I don't know what
[00:17:54] it's was called but it was like whatever
[00:17:55] like 2K res on finina but instead you
[00:17:57] know ALB what whatever so what we did is
[00:17:59] we made an alter ego I don't know how to
[00:18:02] describe this we edited we photoshopped
[00:18:05] albo onto finina and like some of the
[00:18:08] elements of the thumbnail I might add on
[00:18:09] to I'm not sure if like the thumbnail is
[00:18:10] done or not I might add something top
[00:18:12] right top left but we photoshopped the
[00:18:16] the second finina to be albo I'm not
[00:18:18] sure if I'm going to add more stuff I
[00:18:19] don't know yet but so uh that's pretty
[00:18:23] cool so uh that's I think it's great I

[00:18:30] I don't know if we're going to add I
[00:18:31] feel like the top of it is a little
[00:18:32] empty so I don't know if I can try to
[00:18:33] add something to the thumbnail maybe I'm
[00:18:35] overthinking it but
[00:18:38] anyways yeah so I think it's a banger so

[00:20:32] Echo I wouldn't be able to sleep at
[00:20:37] night bro is looking extra dapper today
[00:20:40] shees giant shees
[00:20:50] what oh also can I open my Twitter is
[00:20:53] this wait I'm afraid for this also did
[00:20:57] you guys see at the game awards genin
[00:20:59] got
[00:21:03] mentioned hey a win for genin is a win
[00:21:08] for
[00:21:09] me also how did okay I wasn't expecting
[00:21:13] and frankly I didn't even want genin I'm
[00:21:16] not going to say I didn't want genin if
[00:21:18] you're watching I love you guys but like
[00:21:20] I was definitely nowhere in my mind
[00:21:22] would I think that genin would win the
[00:21:23] voted thing over like fortnite or like
[00:21:25] Final Fantasy but there's no way we lost
[00:21:28] and they lost to cyberpunk bro no way
[00:21:31] you release a game that doesn't work and
[00:21:34] then after you fix it you get an award I
[00:21:36] mean I guess it makes sense but like
[00:21:38] whatever it is what it is I thought
[00:21:40] fortnite would win but whatever I mean
[00:21:43] it is what it
[00:21:47] is HSR did win which is cool um also I
[00:21:52] literally cumed when I saw the God of

[00:52:19] to okay like we mentioned before this
[00:52:21] program is sponsored by the choria
[00:52:23] boutique so while we're sharing content
[00:52:25] from version 4.3 I also wanted to get
[00:52:28] some inspiration for shooting
[00:52:29] commercials for the boutique MH we don't
[00:52:31] want to let our client down
[00:52:33] yeah content we can't verion without
[00:52:37] introducing some new characters as you
[00:52:39] already saw in the trailer Navia and
[00:52:41] chus will be our new playable characters
[00:52:43] show
[00:52:44] me uh I'm sure many of our viewers are
[00:52:47] already familiar with Navia after seeing
[00:52:49] her throughout fontaine's AR Conquest
[00:52:52] but who is sh us who indeed
[00:52:56] Chev oh God other Fon characters have
[00:52:59] already mentioned can't wait for people
[00:53:00] to get mad at me for pronouncing Chev
[00:53:02] wrong finally be making an official
[00:53:04] appearance in version
[00:53:05] 4.3 I'm so excited it's actually
[00:53:08] Chevrolet oh by the way what do you
[00:53:10] think of letting one of our characters
[00:53:12] from the new version take the lead role
[00:53:14] in our commercial oh well I mean if
[00:53:16] we're shooting a video for choria
[00:53:17] boutique then I think Navia would be an
[00:53:19] obvious choice after all nav's clothing
[00:53:22] was designed by chiori herself wait
[00:53:24] Erica that was actually a really natural
[00:53:26] sounding product placement for cheia
[00:53:28] boutique you're you're amazing at this I
[00:53:31] know I know it sounds like product
[00:53:33] placement but Shi really was the
[00:53:35] designer who created nav's outfit um
[00:53:38] next let's have a look at her fashion
[00:53:40] show oo and by fashion show we mean her
[00:53:44] character showcase oh oh oh I always say
[00:53:47] that blind optimism isn't the answer if
[00:53:50] you want a bright future you have to go
[00:53:52] out and season with your own two ha
[00:53:57] hand okay I mean normal ta cool
[00:54:00] umbrella's [ __ ] sick though this
[00:54:02] one's got your name on it [ __ ]
[00:54:04] Princess Peach a proper send from the
[00:54:08] why does she have
[00:54:11] cannons what the [ __ ] is this gang
[00:54:14] plank aoy me take a moment to appreciate
[00:54:17] how customized nav's clothes and
[00:54:20] accessories to reflect her personality
[00:54:22] she clearly pays a lot of attention to
[00:54:24] the small details
[00:54:25] Erica I love how seriously you're taking
[00:54:27] the sponsorship it's really great it's
[00:54:30] important um while we're on this topic
[00:54:32] though Nava's parasol seems pretty
[00:54:35] interesting on the outside it looks like
[00:54:37] a delicate accessory used to block out
[00:54:39] the Sun but on the inside there's
[00:54:41] actually a secret firearm that can be
[00:54:44] used to ward off enemies at a moment's
[00:54:46] notice it's elegant and fierce dude this
[00:54:49] is the first GE character for like 700
[00:54:51] days exactly over 7 even when it comes
[00:54:53] to her enemies Navia is not the type to
[00:54:56] isue basic etiquette so she prefers to
[00:54:59] maintain appropriate distance you don't
[00:55:01] understand how hype I am for the AAL
[00:55:03] skill op Andes multi get an that can
[00:55:08] pass through a I know she's
[00:55:10] aore a successful so sick that means we
[00:55:13] can get a SC if we can get an axe we can
[00:55:16] get a SC normal charged and plunging
[00:55:19] attacks will deal increased damage and
[00:55:21] become infused with the power of Geo
[00:55:24] which cannot be overridden now when
[00:55:26] Navia is in combat there are little
[00:55:29] markings look like bullets I wonder if
[00:55:31] that's some sort of ammo for the
[00:55:33] umbrella oh yeah yes you guessed it when
[00:55:37] a character in the party obtains an
[00:55:39] elemental Shard created from the
[00:55:41] crystalized Navia will gain Crystal
[00:55:44] shrapnel charges Navia will cons charges
[00:55:47] after
[00:55:49] unleashing
[00:55:50] heres with the number of charges that
[00:55:53] she's accumulated oh okay okay okay so
[00:55:56] you're saying that Nava's Elemental
[00:55:58] skill becomes more powerful if she works
[00:56:01] together with other characters in the
[00:56:02] party to trigger the crystallized
[00:56:04] reaction yes exactly okay great Nava's
[00:56:08] Elemental burst calls forth the rosula
[00:56:11] datat salute which unleashes a massive
[00:56:14] bombardment on opponents in front of her
[00:56:16] periodically dealing Geo Elemental
[00:56:18] damage I should also mention that Navia
[00:56:21] will accumulate Crystal shrapnel charges
[00:56:24] at certain interval if she strikes
[00:56:25] enemies with the rosula DAT salute is it
[00:56:29] random like old gang plank or is it like
[00:56:32] how does work is it quadratic is it like
[00:56:34] G you read it firearm salutes before
[00:56:37] important negotiations you know as a way
[00:56:40] to celebrate future success and don't
[00:56:42] misunderstand you it's not an
[00:56:43] intimidation it might be like oh okay
[00:56:47] yeah I guess I guess that's just the
[00:56:49] Spa's way of showing respect in first
[00:56:52] time seeing this yes I saw the a I
[00:56:53] didn't see her her abilities I didn't
[00:56:55] look into it I tried to avoid them of
[00:56:58] the trying to collect the latest Intel
[00:57:01] by exploring all Corners wait there's no
[00:57:04] ores in Fon it doesn't matter but that's
[00:57:06] Expedition Inon rewards gained will be
[00:57:09] increased that was dispatch again by the
[00:57:11] way just mentioned that n is the
[00:57:12] president of Thea dula no ICD I think we
[00:57:16] should bring upa's contri if there is
[00:57:18] it's [ __ ] Gio why do you care about
[00:57:20] ICD I mean it was all thanks to nav's
[00:57:22] leadership exactly some people even lost
[00:57:26] their lives during that disaster y more
[00:57:29] those events weighed heavily on Navia
[00:57:31] but she remained tough and committed to
[00:57:33] Leading the Spina yeah yeah and while
[00:57:36] we're on the topic of fontaine's Crisis
[00:57:38] though the wait did I just get spoiled
[00:57:39] act two is probably yeah yeah I wasn't
[00:57:42] listening it's fine I bet Navia is going
[00:57:44] to be occupied with that for a long time
[00:57:46] oh definitely that's something that
[00:57:48] Travelers will be able to earon off let
[00:57:50] me know what Navia story Quest the Rosa
[00:57:52] multiflora chapter will be become
[00:57:55] available in version 4.3 the Spina will
[00:57:57] be working diligently to rebuild pan
[00:58:00] though repairing the houses will be
[00:58:02] straight forward the emotional distress
[00:58:04] may be much more difficult to address if
[00:58:07] you're curious about how Navia and her
[00:58:08] crew are going to proceed then be sure
[00:58:11] to check it out I'm so
[00:58:14] excited I'm looking forward to seeing
[00:58:16] what happens okay so now that we've
[00:58:18] introduced Navia it's time for chus to
[00:58:21] be in Spotlight Chevrolet ellot brother
[00:58:24] she's a newcomer you probably can't wait
[00:58:27] to learn more about her I feel so seen
[00:58:29] as an American okay um
[00:58:33] how uh first off CH is the captain of
[00:58:36] the special security and surveillance
[00:58:37] Patrol it's a Fontan organization that
[00:58:39] handles all sorts of difficult cases and
[00:58:42] dangerous criminals o
[00:58:44] okay she doesn't like to appear in
[00:58:47] public without good cause so if you
[00:58:49] happen to run into her it's likely that
[00:58:51] you're in some sort of trouble but but
[00:58:54] as long as you're a law-abiding citizen
[00:58:56] there's no need to worry a chevr US is
[00:58:59] actually really easy to get along with
[00:59:00] outside of
[00:59:02] work oh Fisto are just the best snack
[00:59:05] they're easy to the [ __ ] is so many
[00:59:09] sauces no way sauces wait they're
[00:59:11] actually America yo what the [ __ ] is
[00:59:17] happening
[00:59:21] yo hands where I can see them CLE oh my
[00:59:24] God C's power
[00:59:28] crept um what that was so fire and I'm
[00:59:33] not just talking about her
[00:59:35] skills oh my gosh look at her Idol
[00:59:38] animation I love that she loves snacks I
[00:59:41] didn't know that was an idol animation
[00:59:43] girl girl and she gets it she gets it
[00:59:46] she really does she's not exactly what
[00:59:49] you'd expect from the captain of the
[00:59:50] special Patrol though right I guess
[00:59:52] that's kind of true I mean ch's work as
[00:59:55] a captain can be really stressful I mean
[00:59:57] I can't blame the girl for indulging
[00:59:58] every once in a while to relieve some
[01:00:00] stress she even adjusts her training
[01:00:02] regimen to make up for her snacking
[01:00:03] habits in fact she trains more than any
[01:00:06] other member of the special Patrol her
[01:00:08] platoon really admires her for that wow
[01:00:11] okay she's got some willpower that is
[01:00:14] awesome she's really admirable the
[01:00:16] special Patrol prioritizes combat
[01:00:17] ability above all else so the
[01:00:19] organization often attracts some
[01:00:21] eccentric personalities okay yeah the
[01:00:24] special Patrol used to have problems
[01:00:26] with insubordination but ever since
[01:00:28] Cheves took control everyone has fallen
[01:00:30] into line which does not surprise me at
[01:00:32] all she commands respect among her peers
[01:00:34] and she's a formidable and she leads by
[01:00:36] example though she demands Excellence
[01:00:38] from her platoon she holds herself to
[01:00:40] even higher CH by the way shur in French
[01:00:43] means hair so her name being close to sh
[01:00:46] maybe that's why her hair is long as
[01:00:47] [ __ ] maybe it's like a play on know a
[01:00:49] lot of her skills involved using a
[01:00:51] musket she must be a pretty good shot
[01:00:53] mhm for sure
[01:00:55] chevas and her musket are basically
[01:00:57] Partners in her name is harar you
[01:00:59] actually say that word way around a
[01:01:01] firearm chevas uses her musket to fire
[01:01:03] at opponents during her Elemental skill
[01:01:06] for a period of time after unleashing
[01:01:07] her Elemental skill means go restore H
[01:01:11] active character on the field Elemental
[01:01:14] burst chevas fires an explosive grenade
[01:01:17] with her musket which will split into
[01:01:18] secondary explosive shells upon impact
[01:01:21] haha
[01:01:23] impact
[01:01:25] okay wait I noticed that CH has around
[01:01:28] her during combat can she special type
[01:01:31] wait you can actually aim chus obtains
[01:01:33] an overcharged ball when a nearby party
[01:01:35] member triggers the overloaded reaction
[01:01:37] wait they're adding [ __ ] ch's
[01:01:38] Elemental SK they're adding fps to am to
[01:01:41] unleash an even more pyro attack that
[01:01:44] covers a larger AOE those a lot of
[01:01:46] particles it
[01:01:47] look to all pyro and Electro characters
[01:01:50] in the party okay so that's where the
[01:01:52] name overcharged ball
[01:01:55] actually came up with the name herself
[01:01:57] she was read an where the protagonist
[01:01:59] believed that names held a lot of power
[01:02:01] if you give something a cool sounding
[01:02:03] name then you've given yourself an
[01:02:04] advantage over your enemies that kind of
[01:02:06] logic resonated with her I
[01:02:08] guess well I guess she has a point oh
[01:02:11] you should also mention what happens if
[01:02:13] chus is paired with all pyro and Electro
[01:02:15] characters if your party contains at
[01:02:17] least one character of either type then
[01:02:19] triggering the overloaded reaction will
[01:02:21] cause an opponent's pyro and Electro
[01:02:23] resistances
[01:02:26] making over like CH could really shine
[01:02:28] in an overload team comp but I also did
[01:02:31] notice that isn't solely limited to a
[01:02:34] musket she also uses a I love when the
[01:02:36] enemies are flying into Narnia honestly
[01:02:38] if I were a criminal I feel like I'd be
[01:02:40] pretty nervous if she came after me oh
[01:02:42] for sure most people who have something
[01:02:45] to hide avoid her like their lives
[01:02:47] depend on it and maybe it
[01:02:49] does in all seriousness though that's
[01:02:52] why chevas trains so I hope she's
[01:02:56] has like B over teams but it's fine in
[01:02:57] other teams as well then that' be cool
[01:02:59] so when CH is in your party stamina
[01:03:01] consumption from sprinting is decreased
[01:03:03] that's cool oh I love that these two new
[01:03:07] characters are great both of them would
[01:03:09] be great overload can be good against
[01:03:11] fine against bosses and stuff cuz
[01:03:13] they're not getting knocked back but
[01:03:14] against small enemies that get knocked
[01:03:15] back it's really annoy I will make this
[01:03:16] even harder for you oh no we're about to
[01:03:19] take a look at what event wishes that
[01:03:20] Travelers can look forward to in version

[01:07:27] a chance that finina might win the
[01:07:29] finina award okay now I'm
[01:07:33] intrigued well I'm sorry but I'm going
[01:07:35] to have to leave you in suspense if
[01:07:38] Travelers are curious about what aaka
[01:07:40] and the others are doing in Fontaine or
[01:07:42] how Farina fared honestly you'll just I
[01:07:45] kind of don't care hyp for the event so
[01:07:48] we several friends from inauma will be
[01:07:51] in Fontaine for the Fon last time last
[01:07:53] time our friend was in F
[01:07:55] endc time child also have the
[01:07:58] opportunity to participate in a variety
[01:08:00] of activity booths during the festival
[01:08:02] each one will have a different theme and
[01:08:04] Yia [ __ ] died so can you guys stop
[01:08:07] coming to Fon the first activity Booth
[01:08:09] is the Thousand Pace interdiction arc
[01:08:11] minute Sharp Shooting Zone in this
[01:08:14] activity Travelers will use the special
[01:08:16] security and surveillance Patrol
[01:08:18] simulation device to practice targeting
[01:08:20] and shooting opponents the special
[01:08:23] Patrol
[01:08:24] experience how fun target practice can
[01:08:26] be don't what do you mean target
[01:08:27] practice aren't hilly trolls innocent
[01:08:29] people don't we know the lore behind
[01:08:31] hilly why are we will use Studio special
[01:08:34] lighting effects to film a fight scene
[01:08:37] take advantage of the Buffs brought
[01:08:39] about by the special lighting effects to
[01:08:40] defeat an endless team of opponents and
[01:08:42] obtain a higher score so cool those
[01:08:45] special lighting effects are really
[01:08:47] giving off old movie Vibes nav's
[01:08:49] movements are also super smooth what
[01:08:51] it's one type JFK event what what what
[01:08:53] does that even mean sure but not
[01:08:56] everyone is enjoying the fun in games
[01:08:59] Travelers will meet a contract employee
[01:09:01] at the third activity Booth she needs
[01:09:03] some help with her demanding client
[01:09:06] during the activity extreme Drive will
[01:09:09] help her test out stabilization Mecha
[01:09:11] balls what are those look at how the
[01:09:12] traveler chases after those
[01:09:14] stabilization Mecha balls okay I bet
[01:09:17] that contract employee can relate since
[01:09:18] she's being chased down by that client
[01:09:21] totally this this Mario partyz Mecha
[01:09:23] balls seem pretty ordinary but they're
[01:09:24] actually very agile they'll
[01:09:26] automatically all testers by moving
[01:09:29] oppos direction of your movement you can
[01:09:31] find Jump boosters around the testing
[01:09:32] ground I like that Travelers can use
[01:09:34] them to jump higher and further which is
[01:09:36] perfect for quickly traversing to the
[01:09:38] other side of a stabilization Mecha ball
[01:09:40] Travelers in Co-op matches will have to
[01:09:42] find a way to her as many stabilization
[01:09:44] Mecha balls into their target area as
[01:09:46] possible within the time limit the more
[01:09:48] Mecha balls that end up in your area the
[01:09:50] more points you nice so just you want
[01:09:51] the more balls I love balls that's good
[01:09:53] into the frame in this activity
[01:09:56] Travelers will get to shoot their own
[01:09:57] scenes by experimenting with different
[01:09:59] camera positions and narration
[01:10:01] techniques okay cool we get to make a
[01:10:03] movie that's awesome Travelers might
[01:10:06] remember helping out zavier with some
[01:10:07] film making back in inuma but this seems
[01:10:10] more professional wait maybe this can be
[01:10:13] the inspiration for our commercial oh
[01:10:16] now that I think about it a fanian man
[01:10:18] went to inauma to shoot a film I guess
[01:10:21] international travel can be a source of
[01:10:23] artistic ation that must have also been
[01:10:25] true in shor's case since she opened
[01:10:27] Shia's Boutique in Fontaine ooh that
[01:10:30] could be a strong theme for our
[01:10:32] commercial actually haaka and aato
[01:10:34] aren't the only Ena zumans traveling
[01:10:36] abroad
[01:10:37] in kuki shinobu just yo this guy got a
[01:10:40] onear yo use different footage decided
[01:10:43] to tag along as the boss of the arataki
[01:10:46] gang and he brought his Oni Kabuto with
[01:10:49] him I think he plans to train his
[01:10:52] Beatles for battle wow
[01:10:54] event the Blazing armor Beetle battle
[01:10:58] boot camp that name is definitely very
[01:11:00] EO right for sure and there was also a
[01:11:04] beetle battle event in version 3.4 right
[01:11:07] Beetle battles against a super powerful
[01:11:09] Beetle battler I believe his name was
[01:11:12] Grandmaster
[01:11:14] hanado yep Grandmaster hanado made an
[01:11:17] impressive showing during the last
[01:11:18] Beetle battle event this time he's made
[01:11:21] the trip to Lea witho seems like the two
[01:11:24] of them have met a mysterious new Beetle
[01:11:27] Battle Master wa a new Beetle what who
[01:11:29] is it Battle
[01:11:31] Master I'm sorry I'm sorry I can't give
[01:11:35] Travelers will have to discover their
[01:11:36] identity during the event aside from
[01:11:39] meeting this mysterious new Beetle
[01:11:41] Battle Master Travelers can also look
[01:11:43] forward to new ways to battle while the
[01:11:45] movement and charge mechanics remain
[01:11:47] unchanged from the original event
[01:11:49] Travelers can now also instruct Oni
[01:11:51] Kabuto to use guard to defend against
[01:11:53] against Electro bullet and jet stream
[01:11:55] attacks that's cool make use of the
[01:11:57] movement charge and guard strategies to
[01:11:59] topple your opponents no matter what
[01:12:01] they throw at you master them and you'll
[01:12:04] be ready to tackle the ultimate trial of
[01:12:06] the
[01:12:07] [Music]

[01:12:13] to encountering an old friend in the

[01:15:33] news about this epic

[01:15:37] exciting a cat well hang why here
[01:15:42] because we're taking a short break to
[01:15:44] look at the next group of redemption
[01:15:45] codes we'll be back to sharing more
[01:15:47] exciting information about version 4.3
[01:15:50] in just a moment
[01:15:52] yay
[01:15:54] whoa another code whoa that's cool I
[01:15:59] mean they always goes three codes but I
[01:16:00] saying this is cool it's like a bunch of
[01:16:05] [Music]
[01:16:07] masks trying hard to make people play
[01:16:09] that dude it's literally not hard to
[01:16:11] make people play TCG just add a [ __ ]
[01:16:12] rank ladder there you go you have your
[01:16:14] whole fully fledged game all you have to
[01:16:16] do they're not going to do it they're
[01:16:17] not going going to cuz PVP is scary for
[01:16:20] gotra players I guess but like bro
[01:16:22] literally just add around
[01:16:23] [Music]
[01:16:29] one that's literally all you
[01:16:33] need think about it the add a rank mode
[01:16:35] that a bunch of people play it I played
[01:16:36] or you guys k w me which gives exposure
[01:16:38] to it which means more people play it
[01:16:40] and then it just actually becomes its
[01:16:42] thing but that's never going to
[01:16:49] happen I'm scared of losing same
[01:16:53] oh all the codes will be in produced a
[01:16:56] lot of content and we've gotten a ton of
[01:16:58] inspiration [ __ ] at tcg I was top 50
[01:17:02] definitely shaping up totally but before
[01:17:04] we reveal our new idea let's dive into
[01:17:07] the system
[01:17:09] optimization has prepared for version
[01:17:11] 4.3 no it's not happening but one
[01:17:13] Expedition is related optimizations to
[01:17:15] introduce with an ever increasing amount
[01:17:17] of artifact sets to choose from many
[01:17:19] Travelers may have been hoping for a
[01:17:21] better and quicker way to filter and Loc
[01:17:23] desired artifacts after the version 4.3
[01:17:26] update Travelers can check out artifact
[01:17:28] set recommendations for a given
[01:17:30] character to see what artifact sets
[01:17:32] active players have been choosing for
[01:17:33] that character recently that's cool mhm
[01:17:36] in addition an automatic
[01:17:39] locking now when filing artifacts in
[01:17:41] your inventory you can lock the
[01:17:43] artifacts that fit
[01:17:45] your with the automatic locking function
[01:17:48] newly acquired artifacts that fit your
[01:17:49] locking criteria will automatically be
[01:17:52] locked
[01:17:54] oh that's awesome I wasn't looking was
[01:17:55] that
[01:17:56] L I'm telling you average player
[01:17:58] recommendations are always bad not
[01:18:00] always follow the recommended settings
[01:18:02] summarized for active player
[01:18:05] data toct necessary statistics New
[01:18:08] artifact sets will not feature
[01:18:09] recommended locking settings immediately
[01:18:11] okay yes of course if you can lock
[01:18:14] artifacts in batches you can unlock them
[01:18:16] in batches as well lock Bates unlock
[01:18:19] Bates those features in the new update
[01:18:21] that's not all though Travelers will be
[01:18:23] able to sort artifacts by three
[01:18:25] different attributes plus the artifact
[01:18:28] enhancement screen will allow travelers
[01:18:30] to add a greater amount of enhancement
[01:18:32] material at once an enhc limit Fe will
[01:18:35] also be available hopefully these
[01:18:37] optimizations will not only Maks easier
[01:18:39] to find this is cool CU it's faster
[01:18:42] leveling but the like popup is more hype
[01:18:44] for like a video or something like to
[01:18:46] show that's actually so much worse for
[01:18:48] Content [ __ ] I me whatever further
[01:18:51] artifact related optimization pop Up's
[01:18:53] cool the rest is sick the
[01:18:58] pop but it is faster leveling which is
[01:19:00] nice so I agree in addition the project
[01:19:02] team has made adjustments to provide
[01:19:04] smoother Ascension and enhancement
[01:19:06] experiences for travelers when you level
[01:19:08] up a character enhance an artifact or
[01:19:10] enhance a weapon you no longer have to
[01:19:12] click so many pop-up Windows yeah that's
[01:19:14] a lot cooler as a new player using a few
[01:19:17] one and two Star Materials to level
[01:19:19] artifacts
[01:19:20] theit slow especially with Windows
[01:19:23] appearing totally this new optimization
[01:19:26] significantly reduces the amount of
[01:19:28] popup windows that we have to click
[01:19:29] through so Travers can look forward to a
[01:19:32] much smoother enhancement and leveling
[01:19:34] process the next optimization has made
[01:19:36] it easier to repeat domain challenges
[01:19:39] previously Travelers tried to continue
[01:19:41] domain challenges would be sent to the
[01:19:42] entrance of the domain this meant they
[01:19:45] would have to run all the way to the
[01:19:46] center to start the challenge this
[01:19:48] actually saves years of my life by the
[01:19:50] way Cho to continue in a domain
[01:19:51] challenge will load
[01:19:53] to area where you actually fighting you
[01:19:56] [ __ ] spawn at the key so happy
[01:19:58] farming everyone it's actually like plus
[01:20:00] 10 seconds times like thousands of times
[01:20:03] cuz you do it so many times well I do it
[01:20:04] so many times yeah
[01:20:07] definitely it's like the version 4.3 has
[01:20:10] made it easier to clear your quest
[01:20:12] backlog archon Quest chapter 2 Act 4 in
[01:20:15] the depths and unexpected reunion takes
[01:20:18] place in the underground mines of the
[01:20:20] chasm in the past travel I don't care
[01:20:24] the [ __ ] the the the the Walk of
[01:20:26] Shame from entering Vermilion to the key
[01:20:28] every time I would literally rethink my
[01:20:30] entire life and feel terrible but now if
[01:20:33] I just spawn back in the key it's easier
[01:20:35] to just keep going directly to the Min
[01:20:37] who issued the commission to unlock a
[01:20:39] Teleport Waypoint it will take them to
[01:20:41] the corresponding area and automatically
[01:20:44] trigger the next steps of the archon
[01:20:46] quest wait that's sick wait that's
[01:20:48] actually sick I said I didn't care I
[01:20:49] think that back I care easier for
[01:20:51] travelers to quickly progress through
[01:20:52] archon Quest so cool so that'll make it
[01:20:55] significantly easier for new or lapsed
[01:20:57] players to access the archon quest and
[01:20:59] claim those sweet sweet intwined Fates
[01:21:01] as fast as possible that's cool yes
[01:21:04] definitely for sure that's cool also
[01:21:06] oneclick Expeditions will be available
[01:21:08] starting in version 4.3 it only will
[01:21:11] allow travel to Expedition rewards and
[01:21:14] repeat Expeditions with a single click
[01:21:16] Travelers will also processed
[01:21:18] ingredients and forged items with a
[01:21:20] single click y oh sweet yep that's going
[01:21:22] to make it easier to collect rewards
[01:21:24] from Catherine definitely there's also a
[01:21:27] ton of other quality of life SI that's
[01:21:29] so sick for example optimizations have
[01:21:32] been made to enemy tracking with the
[01:21:34] adventure handbook I don't care but cool
[01:21:35] no you do care it's Expedition you c d
[01:21:38] it sa add when performers nobody want to
[01:21:40] click 20 times Travelers will now be
[01:21:41] able to add artifacts in batches there's
[01:21:45] a lot to look forward to be sure to
[01:21:47] check future announcements for more
[01:21:49] information okay moving on from
[01:21:51] optimizations a new Fontaine style realm
[01:21:53] layout will be added to the Serena

[01:22:14] cool underwater Kingdom it's just
[01:22:16] actually really cool I know and they'll
[01:22:19] be even prettier once Travelers have the
[01:22:21] chance to make them their own I'm so

[01:30:30] the character demo osds so that'd be
[01:30:38] cool yeah star I was getting the riding
[01:30:40] character I saw that I I I I watched the
[01:30:42] trailer when I was
[01:30:44] live gon didn't have anything there
[01:30:46] though sad I thought they would that's
[01:30:48] why I watched it well that's not why I
[01:30:50] watched it but for the
[01:30:55] reason we'd be in chzn and he still
[01:30:57] hasn't released the DU
[01:30:59] guide you're funny but I literally have
[01:31:02] duuke in my team right now we are
[01:31:04] working on it Z Jeff made fun of me for
[01:31:06] not doing it he literally asked about it
[01:31:08] I keep getting DM spammed [ __ ] genin
[01:31:10] scientists talking about duuke [ __ ]
[01:31:13] everyone got to it before me listen I
[01:31:15] told you guys for months now I said I'm
[01:31:17] waiting for I said I'm waiting for Nita
[01:31:18] then I said I'm waiting for finina and
[01:31:20] then literally 2 weeks ago I told you
[01:31:22] guys two weeks ago I told you guys I
[01:31:24] will be working on it after Gan and
[01:31:26] strangling given the influx of people
[01:31:29] dming me I think I'll do it before
[01:31:31] strangling and it'll I'll try to get it
[01:31:33] done before the end of 2024 I said so
[01:31:35] this isn't like something new I said
[01:31:37] even like weeks ago duuke guide would
[01:31:39] come out as my like right after it' be
[01:31:42] Jean Shang Ling duuke I think I'm going
[01:31:44] to do uh Jean Navia duuke that's
[01:31:46] probably going to be the order Nava's
[01:31:48] weapon could also be good for duuke I
[01:31:49] don't know what it does don't type leaks
[01:31:51] I I don't know [ __ ] you so we're going
[01:31:53] to wait and see but also additionally
[01:31:57] also if we're going to weapon ranking we
[01:31:59] might as well put that in that's why uh
[01:32:02] also uh uh uh uh uh so I've been trying
[01:32:05] to make duuke [ __ ] retro buron work
[01:32:07] because I think it's funny um and I I
[01:32:10] want to test if it works with finina so
[01:32:11] we're going to have to test a lot of
[01:32:12] teams I actually think there might be a
[01:32:14] chance we could also do like like finina
[01:32:16] yolan baiju I think that team would be
[01:32:18] funny so we have a lot of Team testing
[01:32:20] to do um
[01:32:22] that no one has done because it's duuke
[01:32:24] and who plays no I mean it might be done
[01:32:26] already but we have a lot to do I want
[01:32:28] to do yeah so yeah so just wait okay CU
[01:32:31] like obviously you could play Vape
[01:32:32] obviously you could play melt but I kind
[01:32:34] of want to try I kind want to try the
[01:32:36] other stuff so I don't know well I mean
[01:32:39] this is technically a vape team with
[01:32:40] like one buron per year but I think it's
[01:32:42] funny so cuz you can call it retro
[01:32:45] burgeon uh melt dude melal luk I like
[01:32:49] melal luk with this so I played this
[01:32:50] team before before finina came out I
[01:32:52] played I actually okay this was like the
[01:32:55] closest I came to the other delute guide
[01:32:57] I tried this team out I tried speed
[01:32:59] running with this team it was actually
[01:33:00] fun you Kaa Infuse okay you cryo Infuse
[01:33:04] Kazo burst with ka's E and you swirl
[01:33:07] pyro and then you just like [ __ ]
[01:33:09] everything up it was actually pretty
[01:33:10] cool I don't know if you would play
[01:33:12] finina here though I'm not sure maybe
[01:33:15] instead of Bennett and then like a cryo
[01:33:19] healer I don't know if that would work
[01:33:21] I'm could try it but this team was
[01:33:25] fun yeah you have caul and ball in the
[01:33:28] same
[01:33:35] team level 88 duuke Al dude shut the
[01:33:38] [ __ ]
[01:33:40] up actually sheets very well well the
[01:33:43] what's nice like the team I've seen it
[01:33:44] speed I mean I have played it it's good
[01:33:47] cuz you can Vape not Vape sorry you can
[01:33:50] melt a lot of your deluke like like his
[01:33:52] burst and [ __ ] and then you also swirl
[01:33:55] pyro and then even your ka's damage is
[01:33:57] decent if he ever melts like starts
[01:33:59] melting after a bit it's like yeah and
[01:34:01] then you get a tack buff on everyone
[01:34:03] like it seems pretty good I'm just
[01:34:04] wondering if probably with finina
[01:34:06] there's a like we could try like um I
[01:34:08] don't know let's say duuke where the
[01:34:10] [ __ ] is finina duuke finina cryo healer
[01:34:14] maybe shallot
[01:34:17] maybe there's no reason to die on a rer
[01:34:20] healing sucks I mean you get 200
[01:34:23] em maybe anyways cryo healer and then
[01:34:26] like Kaza let's get this interview
[01:34:29] started or genan and then cryo like
[01:34:32] damage
[01:34:33] dealer
[01:34:35] but
[01:34:37] yeah Mika Mika's advantages are attack
[01:34:41] speed and um like normal like healing
[01:34:45] when you like Well Physical buff but
[01:34:48] mostly the attack speed which is why I
[01:34:50] like it for like wander but I don't know
[01:34:53] if duuke cares about
[01:34:56] that like
[01:35:02] sure yeah Mika also doesn't really have
[01:35:05] cryo app he has one he literally has
[01:35:10] one so we would try this I could also
[01:35:13] try
[01:35:20] this
[01:35:22] [Music]
[01:35:25] what's our objective but I don't know I
[01:35:27] don't know why I would play this over
[01:35:28] like just like yolon
[01:35:31] there like this
[01:35:34] team either this one
[01:35:38] or
[01:35:47] uh all right let's head off actually no
[01:35:51] I I don't like this yeah I don't know
[01:35:53] something anyways wait no Bennett you
[01:35:56] just go Bennett on maiden's never mind
[01:35:59] you want me on your team yeah actually
[01:36:01] definitely but then SRO might
[01:36:05] lowkey
[01:36:10] yeah wait no you would want you need
[01:36:13] more Hydra than that finina is not
[01:36:16] enough I want this I don't know we'll
[01:36:19] figure it out anyways
[01:36:22] um Chad is there a VOD of the stream
[01:36:25] where is it genin
[01:36:29] 4 anyways if you're new thanks for
[01:36:31] watching be sure to follow and you can
[01:36:33] you can if you join the Discord all the
[01:36:35] codes if you miss them they'll be there
[01:36:39] it enough with Kazo verse yeah I guess
[01:36:42] you could Kazo Infuse the
[01:36:43] hydro I mean you definitely would
[01:36:45] actually there's no reason you wouldn't
[01:36:48] so
[01:36:50] maybe yeah actually yeah actually yeah
[01:36:54] you probably would but then
[01:36:57] you want me to come along you probably
[01:37:00] would you could also do I think so I
[01:37:03] think
[01:37:05] lowkey I think if you're ever okay okay
[01:37:07] okay hear me out I think if you're ever
[01:37:08] in this situation it's time to pull the
[01:37:11] low
[01:37:14] key if you can't fully stack with
[01:37:16] Bennett sing might help cuz he actually
[01:37:18] gives like a little bit of healing so I
[01:37:20] kind try that but anyways uh let me wait
[01:37:24] where is
[01:37:32] it oh I could have just restreamed to
[01:37:34] YouTube I just realized maybe in the
[01:37:43] future
[01:37:50] h
[01:37:58] anyways be sure to redeem your codes now
[01:38:01] true wait chat okay wait wait wait wait
[01:38:06] chat I not C my well it's not capped but
[01:38:08] it's going to cap what if we do
[01:38:09] Vermillion let's do
[01:38:13] Vermillion dude I want to um I want to
[01:38:16] do I wanted to make a like okay I'm
[01:38:20] going to make a video listen I want to
[01:38:22] make a video about the
[01:38:25] best characters to pull for your account
[01:38:27] like the most valuable five stars okay I
[01:38:28] don't know if I'll title it the first
[01:38:30] thing or the second thing or the third
[01:38:31] thing like I don't know what I'm going
[01:38:32] to title it but something like that I
[01:38:33] was going to make it a top five but then
[01:38:35] I was thinking about it and I was like
[01:38:36] there's no objective answer to who
[01:38:39] should be three
[01:38:40] four two and
[01:38:43] one between a lot of
[01:38:46] them
[01:38:49] um because I I
[01:38:53] think zff would scream at me if I put
[01:38:57] Nikita uh anywhere under
[01:39:01] kazua and I think the average viewer
[01:39:04] would scream at me if they don't see
[01:39:05] kazua as number one so I think Kaza and
[01:39:08] Nita are I mean I I think Nita is more
[01:39:10] valuable but I think they're both like
[01:39:11] it depends because what if you're not
[01:39:13] playing dendro and what if you like it
[01:39:14] just depends on a lot of stuff so I um I
[01:39:18] think it's better it's easier if I
[01:39:20] structure it a way that's like kind of
[01:39:23] less to more valuable like in order but
[01:39:26] like I still keep them in the same
[01:39:29] like like tiar type of thing especially
[01:39:32] with like like three and four okay I
[01:39:34] I'll spoil it to for you guys three and
[01:39:35] four are like two Hydro characters but
[01:39:38] like which Hydro is better than the
[01:39:39] other isn't a very black and white
[01:39:41] answer like a a lot of the hydro
[01:39:44] characters are pretty similar like are
[01:39:47] pretty are very are better than the
[01:39:49] other one depending on what you're doing
[01:39:51] or similar in value so like I mean
[01:39:55] actually a lot of like like okay finina
[01:39:57] kokomi nevet and yolan are all really
[01:40:00] good like they're all really good uh you
[01:40:02] could argue kakomi is more replaceable
[01:40:04] cuz you could use another healer and
[01:40:05] then whatever but like they're all
[01:40:07] really good and then like I mean NE too
[01:40:09] but she's like has one really like one
[01:40:12] incredible team comp but then the rest
[01:40:15] is just
[01:40:16] NE
[01:40:18] um but then even like
[01:40:22] if like Hydra characters just depend on
[01:40:24] your account which is really weird to
[01:40:26] say well it's not weird to say cuz like
[01:40:28] yeah there just there's so many good
[01:40:30] Hydra characters and they all do
[01:40:31] something very different except like I
[01:40:34] mean like yolan and S are like the same
[01:40:36] but you can use them together and SRA
[01:40:37] has more highy drop and defensive
[01:40:39] utility but yolan has a bit more like
[01:40:41] team
[01:40:43] damage well not always but yeah stop
[01:40:46] fighting the Temple of
[01:40:49] wisdom so I don't know
[01:40:54] to the
[01:40:58] wicked how many two s are worth oh yeah
[01:41:00] for sure well that's the thing with
[01:41:02] Hydro characters too is like the more
[01:41:04] you have the less they're valuable but a
[01:41:06] lot of hydros you can run together like
[01:41:08] SRO yolan finina even having all three
[01:41:12] you're never really going to bench one
[01:41:13] of them well okay you might but like
[01:41:16] it's very rare for you to want to bench
[01:41:18] one of them cuz you can run cro and Yan
[01:41:20] together or cro and finina together or
[01:41:21] yolan finina together or all three
[01:41:23] together with like Co like
[01:41:28] Jean so I don't
[01:41:32] know um why am I doing this domain why
[01:41:36] am I doing this domain get me out of
[01:41:39] here so I I'm like yeah so I'm going to
[01:41:42] structure the video that way but it will
[01:41:45] be like it I think it'll be like most
[01:41:48] valuable and then it'll end with the
[01:41:49] most valuable but I don't think I'll
[01:41:51] I'll rank them like 5 4 3 2 1 I think
[01:41:53] it'll just be like sections because if I
[01:41:56] number them then I have to go through
[01:41:58] the debate
[01:41:59] of finina and yolon and nlet and child
[01:42:03] and Co well Kong is I wouldn't put her
[01:42:05] in the same bucket but you know you get
[01:42:08] what I'm saying and then also [ __ ]
[01:42:10] like kazua and Nita and then yeah uh
[01:42:14] with that in mind I
[01:42:17] think
[01:42:19] um I actually think the three archons
[01:42:23] that aren't the three archons that
[01:42:25] aren't the like that aren't finina and
[01:42:28] Nita are um pretty cool to have on your
[01:42:31] account with Ryden being the better
[01:42:35] one so it's going to be like I'm
[01:42:37] probably going to talk about them as
[01:42:46] well people who still use venti ain't no
[01:42:49] way yo sh chill don't mind the side
[01:42:52] effects seems like an
[01:42:56] emergency let my
[01:43:03] chill like venty yeah ventti is just the
[01:43:07] thing with venti is like when he works
[01:43:09] he works so [ __ ] well but I also
[01:43:14] like I would never
[01:43:19] yeah so it's but
[01:43:21] like
[01:43:23] yeah I think he's a good unit to have
[01:43:25] but he's not a good unit to pull in my
[01:43:27] opinion like vendy's very useful to have
[01:43:30] but I wouldn't recommend pulling
[01:43:32] him that's just me do whatever the [ __ ]
[01:43:35] you
[01:43:41] want yeah you can use in this Abyss you
[01:43:44] actually can he's actually surprisingly
[01:43:46] good for the uh fatherless flame
[01:43:48] leers because he can pull them together
[01:43:51] so like
[01:43:54] yeah that is a good
[01:43:57] point why' you lock the ciret dude it's
[01:44:00] a crit ciret on
[01:44:04] MAR he's better to pull than third Hydro
[01:44:07] uh not no but he's better than pull than
[01:44:09] like a fourth I mean bro double hydro's
[01:44:13] cracked and your second team probably
[01:44:14] wants
[01:44:18] Hydro also I was thinking about how I
[01:44:22] was thinking about how easy it's to uh
[01:44:24] wait someone even do a temple the [ __ ]
[01:44:27] bro can I wait till Navia Ban fine we'll
[01:44:30] do Temple but I was thinking about how
[01:44:31] easy it is to make a
[01:44:34] um okay let me pull am I actually do I
[01:44:37] actually have to pull right now dude who
[01:44:38] the [ __ ] redeemed that how do you even
[01:44:41] have this many
[01:44:49] points they're only message this stream
[01:44:51] is hurry up and
[01:45:05] pull okay fine wait I don't even have
[01:45:08] enough Primos do I have
[01:45:16] gems I mean I have okay
[01:45:19] fine
[01:45:24] please no five star okay thank
[01:45:27] God I'm actually so mad about this oh
[01:45:30] whith okay I
[01:45:33] mean oh fa okay I mean I already have
[01:45:38] both of those r five but you know we can
[01:45:40] use another I mean not a bad Tempo I
[01:45:43] would like that on my free to playay
[01:45:45] account W sth and
[01:45:47] F take those [ __ ] you for making me
[01:45:49] Temple but but we take those build pity
[01:46:08] copium but yeah anyways as I was saying
[01:46:10] I think the archons are nice to
[01:46:12] have uh especially Jang Le right like
[01:46:15] outside of Nita finina especially Jang
[01:46:17] Le Ryden and then I think um I
[01:46:21] think net and alham are the most
[01:46:25] valuable DPSS in terms of five stars
[01:46:27] personally well nevet is gamebreaking
[01:46:29] but like I think Al hi them is after and
[01:46:32] then I also think NE is very very good
[01:46:34] but like a weird type of good where it's
[01:46:37] like you might not want her but you
[01:46:38] might want
[01:46:44] her ain't no way he said I'll height
[01:46:47] them no but I think I'll them is like
[01:46:48] pretty objectively very strong like he's
[01:46:50] just really strong and his teams are
[01:46:52] really good and dendro is really good
[01:46:53] and Hyper Bloom's really good and like a
[01:46:55] lot of things are like everything about
[01:46:57] him is
[01:46:58] good
[01:47:02] um yeah like I'm not saying this because
[01:47:04] I like him because if I was then I'd put
[01:47:06] Shia here but like I I think he's just
[01:47:08] really
[01:47:09] good
[01:47:13] um that's just DPS character- wise
[01:47:16] though like like on field main
[01:47:19] DPS
[01:47:21] yeah like okay I don't think making nuu
[01:47:23] work is hard though cuz the more I like
[01:47:26] learn about nuu the more like Kole is
[01:47:28] good the more there's like [ __ ]
[01:47:30] fourstar teams you can use and like you
[01:47:32] don't even need Nita like Nita can be
[01:47:34] good but you can use like so many
[01:47:35] different on fielders you can like kind
[01:47:37] of quick Swap and like there's really a
[01:47:39] lot you can do with Nita with nuu it's
[01:47:42] all going to be a bloom team it's all
[01:47:43] one
[01:47:44] team but like there is a lot of
[01:47:46] variations of it even yao yao made her
[01:47:49] like a lot more accessible you can even
[01:47:50] ya Yao Candace like there's a lot of
[01:47:52] [ __ ] NE teams they're all Bloom like
[01:47:54] it's just one team type like archetype
[01:47:57] but like there's a lot of ways to do it
[01:47:59] so I like her a lot
[01:48:01] more um especially with the release of
[01:48:03] like more
[01:48:10] dendros so I think those are the main
[01:48:12] ones I'm going to talk about plus hydros
[01:48:13] and then yeah there might be some others
[01:48:16] I'll have to think about a bit more uh
[01:48:18] but in terms of like five star
[01:48:20] characters I don't know if there's
[01:48:22] really anything else like
[01:48:28] yeah
[01:48:38] yeah what about aloy
[01:48:43] YULA I think Ryden is
[01:48:46] um yeah I like I like Ryden because of
[01:48:51] a lot of
[01:48:55] things yeah I don't know why she's level
[01:49:00] one me I can get her like 50 dude do you
[01:49:03] want me to get her to [ __ ] 50 is that
[01:49:05] what you
[01:49:09] want M free pull
[01:49:16] true hyper carries like Shia Scara and
[01:49:19] YULA are dog sh question mark that's not
[01:49:21] what I'm saying but if I'm talking about
[01:49:22] pull value on your account DPS
[01:49:24] characters are like like on field DPSS
[01:49:27] you get the one you like or the one
[01:49:29] that's good okay they're very rarely
[01:49:31] going to be the same pull Valu as a
[01:49:32] support because think about it you're
[01:49:34] playing one on fielder in a team and
[01:49:35] three strong supports and those strong
[01:49:38] supports can convert to like can
[01:49:40] translate to eight different teams like
[01:49:42] for example let's say you build SRO
[01:49:44] official you're probably going to play
[01:49:46] SRO official every single day for the
[01:49:48] rest of your life unless you just don't
[01:49:50] want to or pull for like way more
[01:49:52] characters but if you build Shia and
[01:49:55] Scara you're probably only going to use
[01:49:57] one and bench the other yeah you could
[01:49:58] do two teams but okay then you pull YULA
[01:50:00] you're going to bench one of the three
[01:50:01] you can't play all three but like you
[01:50:03] can play finina yolon and sing trro all
[01:50:07] together so it's like it's a difference
[01:50:09] in like how valuable they are but like I
[01:50:12] think also the main DVS character you
[01:50:14] pull for Can Depend a lot about like the
[01:50:16] play style you like so like I don't like
[01:50:18] recommending DPSS as much but
[01:50:20] I think net transcends that and almost
[01:50:23] AO sorry not AO whoa almost alham that's
[01:50:27] my take I think nevet transcends that
[01:50:29] nlet like has more value than some
[01:50:31] support characters not all of them
[01:50:34] obviously but like than some of them and
[01:50:35] I think alyam doesn't but he's like one
[01:50:37] of the top like one of the DPS I care
[01:50:44] commend Ryden C2 or a weapon
[01:50:47] okay Ryden C2 is good but the problem is
[01:50:51] if you end up playing Ryden hyper blo
[01:50:53] you're going to be very mad at yourself
[01:50:55] if you get her C2 whereas the weapon you
[01:50:57] can use on other characters too so C2 is
[01:51:00] great and you could C2 and use the catch
[01:51:02] so if you know if you want a hyper carry
[01:51:04] your Ryden could be good but keep in
[01:51:06] mind that the weapon could be used on
[01:51:07] other characters too if you end up
[01:51:08] playing em
[01:51:14] Ryden a bitter P to swallow taking a
[01:51:17] turn for the
[01:51:18] better waste to the Wicked play waste to
[01:51:21] the wicked is my Del gear by the way I
[01:51:23] don't even
[01:51:29] know kind
[01:51:31] of I don't think I'm on my best pieces
[01:51:34] but they're pretty
[01:51:38] good to the wicked whoa
[01:51:48] Wicked
[01:51:50] why is C2 bad for hyper Bloom it's not
[01:51:53] bad
[01:51:54] okay the thing with okay C2 isn't bad
[01:51:57] for hyper blo it's just you spent maybe
[01:51:59] 100 $200 $300 on no it's more than 100
[01:52:03] why the [ __ ] did I say 100 it's [ __ ]
[01:52:04] three riding copies whatever hundreds on
[01:52:07] um well it depends on your luck but
[01:52:09] whatever you spend a bunch of Primos on
[01:52:10] C2 increasing your burst damage and you
[01:52:13] don't press your burst in hyper Bloom
[01:52:14] you literally do not press Q on right
[01:52:17] hyper Bloom up

[02:05:44] I'm fighting the
[02:05:47] slime
[02:05:50] dude that slime dodged how the [ __ ] is
[02:05:52] that my fault how the [ __ ] is it my
[02:05:55] fault that the Slime knows how to dodge
[02:05:56] how the [ __ ] is that my fault bro that
[02:05:59] is not my
[02:06:08] fault thoughts on iO very versatile good
[02:06:10] on a lot of teams but he kind of got
[02:06:12] powercraft by net but he has more all
[02:06:14] field presence so that's
[02:06:16] cool still good though you want
[02:06:30] also Chad I accidentally killed two
[02:06:31] blubber beasts I try I do I literally
[02:06:33] don't kill blubber Beast ever but fina's
[02:06:36] [ __ ] gang tries to [ __ ] gang up on
[02:06:38] them every two seconds so I always have
[02:06:39] to change her to like usia form or
[02:06:42] whatever the [ __ ] it is so that it it
[02:06:44] stops killing them but then I literally
[02:06:45] pressed deluke burst and it Vaped both
[02:06:47] of the seals on the be Beach while I was
[02:06:49] doing the moralay line that's like
[02:06:51] there's a moral line like right next to
[02:06:52] the beach like like here or some [ __ ]
[02:06:54] and there's seals next to it and duuke
[02:06:56] [ __ ] Vaped both of them dude it
[02:06:58] wasn't my
[02:07:00] fault so duuk is the murderer not
[02:07:05] me is Calamity queller on Raiden
[02:07:09] heresy Calamity queller on Ryden um I
[02:07:13] mean the base attack is high I that's
[02:07:16] pretty much all I can give you
[02:07:22] [Applause]
[02:07:24] if you ask the Jeff he will tell you to
[02:07:26] go
[02:07:29] fa but
[02:07:37] um but you know you can always go the
[02:07:42] catch T this on c65 Stars no but yolon
[02:07:45] clears yolan finina and Nita
[02:08:03] Yoo is Miss spitter worth pulling uh
[02:08:06] yeah like I hate weapon managers but as
[02:08:09] far as Weapons go Miss spitter is really
[02:08:10] good Miss spitter and Jade cutter are
[02:08:12] pretty cracked for
[02:08:14] swords depends what the other weapon is
[02:08:17] though
[02:08:19] Oh wait we're getting Nava's Axe and
[02:08:22] Miss spitter oh my God yes I need Miss
[02:08:26] spitter wait that's so good oh my God I
[02:08:29] just CED wait I'm actually pulling I'm
[02:08:32] actually pulling I'm actually pulling I
[02:08:34] I'll stop if I get nav's axe but if I
[02:08:36] lose and I get Mis spitter at least I
[02:08:37] will get the [ __ ] donut sorry but
[02:08:40] that would be sick cuz my IO rank one
[02:08:43] miss spitter true but I don't have Mis
[02:08:45] spitter so my IO is on
[02:08:47] blackl
[02:09:01] drown no not
[02:09:05] that how do you know what Nava's weapon
[02:09:07] does uh see that's the cool thing it
[02:09:09] doesn't matter because it's an axe
[02:09:11] therefore I want
[02:09:15] it thought on Lenny
[02:09:29] Showtime is Excel a good replacement for
[02:09:31] a main DPS for Vapes like H okay this
[02:09:34] has to be
[02:09:37] bait yes Shang
[02:09:40] Ling if the okay if your question is is
[02:09:43] Shang Ling the answer is almost always
[02:09:45] yes almost
[02:09:47] always
[02:09:55] thank you for making me happy every day
[02:09:57] with your streams and clips thank you
[02:09:59] for Mak and best guides out there thank
[02:10:03] you Mr Bongo dude I was thinking about
[02:10:05] this do you know dude I was thinking
[02:10:06] about how easy it would be for me well I
[02:10:08] guess not just for me but I was thinking
[02:10:10] about how easy it would be to make a
[02:10:12] video that's just
[02:10:14] like wrong or like something I don't
[02:10:16] believe but in a convincing manner and I
[02:10:18] think I could get away with it like
[02:10:20] think about it I could I think I could
[02:10:22] make a video
[02:10:23] essay I think I could make a video essay
[02:10:26] on how Bennett is bad and at least get
[02:10:28] like 30% of the people to believe me I
[02:10:31] could be like dude think about think
[02:10:32] about the arguments think about it okay
[02:10:34] Bennett used to be broken and stuff
[02:10:36] right okay now dendro came out a bunch
[02:10:38] of [ __ ] hyper doesn't need him Bloom
[02:10:40] doesn't need him aggravate doesn't need
[02:10:41] him spread doesn't need them plus now
[02:10:43] there's finina and a bunch of uh
[02:10:45] characters like nevet that won't even
[02:10:47] [ __ ] use them Ena cares about your
[02:10:49] healing he doesn't heal [ __ ] and skills
[02:10:51] on HP and you don't even need V anymore
[02:10:54] see I don't think that's true by the way
[02:10:56] I think men it's still like [ __ ]
[02:10:57] broken but think about how many people I
[02:11:00] could convince if I want to be wrong so
[02:11:03] Jeff would have destroy you
[02:11:17] true
[02:11:21] isn't that half your guides
[02:11:28] what take it
[02:11:33] easy I have in 23
[02:11:36] months now Ben it's cracked I was
[02:11:39] thinking I was actually thinking about
[02:11:40] this
[02:11:43] like I think dude I low key I'm sorry if
[02:11:46] I curse your favorite character cuz cuz
[02:11:48] I feel like we're going to get a bad one
[02:11:49] soon I think we're do a bad character
[02:11:51] cuz it's been so it's been a while since
[02:11:54] I got to like be mad at a character cuz
[02:11:57] we got like finina we got nevet we got
[02:12:00] like even good four stars like ya Yao
[02:12:02] Kirara like I know DEA but we've gotten
[02:12:05] a lot of bad good characters that like
[02:12:07] I've been hyping up a bunch of
[02:12:08] characters I kind of want a character
[02:12:09] that I'm not hyping up just for like the
[02:12:12] the like the contrast you know cuz like
[02:12:14] I can't have people think I'm hyping
[02:12:16] every character up however ever I will
[02:12:18] say for characters that are just like
[02:12:20] okay options like feel like typing
[02:12:23] rizley like rzz is like fine so it's
[02:12:24] like I'm not going to [ __ ] on him cuz
[02:12:27] he's okay like he's fine he's a main DPS
[02:12:28] he's okay like I think he's I think part
[02:12:30] of his the part I [ __ ] on is I think his
[02:12:33] C1 should be part of his kit I think his
[02:12:35] combos without C1 like don't feel as
[02:12:37] fulfilling but it is what it is um but
[02:12:42] yeah uh the only problem with that is
[02:12:45] like if a character is really good it's
[02:12:46] like it makes sense hpe them up but if a
[02:12:48] character is bad like I'm honest about
[02:12:50] it on my stream and stuff but whenever I
[02:12:52] make a guide like I I have to like I
[02:12:55] talk about power level but like a big
[02:12:57] part of it is just like people just want
[02:12:59] to build the character they want to
[02:13:00] build so it's like yeah I don't
[02:13:03] know it's like I don't want to just be
[02:13:05] like [ __ ] talking about that the
[02:13:07] whole time if arlino is going to be bad
[02:13:09] I'll Riot yeah arino can't be bad if
[02:13:12] arino is bad someone's going to there's
[02:13:14] actually going to be crimes
[02:13:16] committed in game
[02:13:18] so I mean I don't you know hopefully not
[02:13:33] but RZ is very much a character to
[02:13:35] recommend against no that's wrong rizzly
[02:13:37] is pretty like me like mid DPS wise but
[02:13:40] as far as a main DPS goes if you like
[02:13:42] his play style you can make him work
[02:13:44] like with a lot of teams especially with
[02:13:45] C1 and you can play well by a lot of
[02:13:47] teams I mean like like melter freeze and
[02:13:49] finina can be decent with him and like
[02:13:52] he's
[02:13:53] okay I don't think he's like like main
[02:13:56] so support characters are a lot easier
[02:13:58] to recommend main DPS characters are
[02:14:00] very much like play who the [ __ ] you
[02:14:01] want but there's some that are more
[02:14:03] recommended than others like you know
[02:14:05] noet and I'll H
[02:14:13] them like I yeah I enjoy the team with
[02:14:15] Shena and I didn't activate a C1 yet
[02:14:18] probably will soon but like I still have
[02:14:19] C action in the
[02:14:22] game I think I'm still on whith right oh
[02:14:24] I have level 80 but I'm usually on wiith
[02:14:27] when I play him actually I always on
[02:14:28] wiith when I play
[02:14:31] him think grizli want to be part of his
[02:14:33] kid yes that's what I said earlier I I
[02:14:35] think so it doesn't make sense for it
[02:14:37] not to
[02:14:40] be but yeah I don't
[02:14:46] know
[02:14:48] like
[02:14:51] yeah I guess we're do a standard Baner
[02:14:54] five star right so we're probably going
[02:14:55] to get a [ __ ] character
[02:14:58] soon day
[02:15:05] two stop typing Clarin there's no way
[02:15:08] they make her bad I don't give a [ __ ]
[02:15:10] they dude they don't yo look at her bro
[02:15:12] look at her they would not do that they
[02:15:15] would not do that look at her bro look
[02:15:17] at her
[02:15:20] her yeah her personality yeah they
[02:15:23] wouldn't do that to
[02:15:24] her no Gio on standard aare okay [ __ ]
[02:15:28] make okay never mind NAIA Ms are in my
[02:15:30] chat right now I love you
[02:15:32] guys just Chuck albo in standard who the
[02:15:35] [ __ ] cares albo would be dude albo would
[02:15:37] actually be really good as a standard
[02:15:39] five star like cuz he's a he's a decent
[02:15:41] character to have he's flexible he's
[02:15:43] just not like the most like valuable cuz
[02:15:45] of Gio but like he's pretty flexible
[02:15:55] your Al's good for standard cuz his cons
[02:15:58] are [ __ ] excuse you excuse you but
[02:16:02] albo's constellation four gives more
[02:16:07] plunge attack damage therefore being an
[02:16:11] optimal constellation to unlock for Shia
[02:16:13] true true also can anyone in the [ __ ]
[02:16:18] World explain to me how this
[02:16:19] constellation is albo C4 but Shia C4
[02:16:24] gives defense can anyone can anyone
[02:16:29] explain you have Sean albo wait I didn't
[02:16:31] even know I had Sean albo what the [ __ ]
[02:16:33] does Sean albo even
[02:16:36] do wait I literally didn't even know I
[02:16:38] had that I have not played albo in like
[02:16:40] a
[02:16:45] year wait no actually though how is this
[02:16:47] this dude imagine if this was just Shia
[02:16:50] boom 40% 30% punch attack
[02:16:53] damage it's a C4 it doesn't matter that
[02:16:56] much but like dude what the [ __ ] is
[02:17:11] this they should hot fix it
[02:17:14] true no that would never happen
[02:17:25] h's not for everyone I'm going to gate
[02:17:27] keep
[02:17:28] him
[02:17:39] D settle
[02:17:42] down
[02:17:45] to the side effect which better is aad
[02:17:48] I'm not reading that never
[02:17:51] mind I don't like the current weapon the
[02:17:53] current I don't like the current five
[02:17:54] stars that much cuz I think there's
[02:17:56] usually better options for like your
[02:17:57] account like I okay I know Scarlet Sands
[02:17:59] is like really good on strangling and
[02:18:01] Hut outside of just uh Soo but like I
[02:18:05] feel like I'd rather just have a h like
[02:18:07] 99% of the
[02:18:11] time and same with Haron like I'd
[02:18:13] usually rather just have a jade cutter
[02:18:14] or a Miss spitter and it's like I know
[02:18:16] you can like if you have them they're
[02:18:18] decent a lot of characters but it's like
[02:18:19] if you're going to choose to pull for a
[02:18:21] five star like all five star weapons are
[02:18:23] technically like the same price like
[02:18:24] you're not going to get one for free so
[02:18:26] it's like well I mean yeah you know what
[02:18:29] I mean like they're all like rap bner
[02:18:30] weapons so it's like if you're going to
[02:18:31] pull for one you should probably pull
[02:18:33] for like the best
[02:18:41] one seems like an
[02:18:44] emergency [ __ ] the TI's f
[02:18:49] does batt pass weapon your opinion I
[02:18:51] actually don't know anymore I used to
[02:18:53] say serpent
[02:18:55] spine but with the new ones it probably
[02:18:58] still is serpent but I actually like I
[02:19:00] do like wolf
[02:19:02] Fang uh Talking Stick true do you think
[02:19:06] I should pull Oro when they release her
[02:19:10] I mean serent spine might still be the
[02:19:11] best oh wait yo yo that could be we need
[02:19:15] that we actually need that we actually
[02:19:17] need this we actually need
[02:19:20] this L bits should I bu for Hut or arino
[02:19:23] arino I mean I don't know what the [ __ ]
[02:19:25] she does I don't know if she'll be good
[02:19:27] but it's
