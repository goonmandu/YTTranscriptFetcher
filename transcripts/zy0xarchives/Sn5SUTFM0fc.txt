[00:35:29] is it's coming out uh also the strongbox
[00:35:32] video is done as well um so as far as
[00:35:36] like the the the the guide videos though
[00:35:39] um for genin there's a pull value video
[00:35:42] coming out that one's a bit later though
[00:35:44] uh in the more near future we're getting
[00:35:46] a Boothill guide for Star Rail and we're
[00:35:49] going to get a a probably like a tip
[00:35:51] video or something for Wawa if you are
[00:35:55] interested uh and then after that I have
[00:35:58] no [ __ ] clue where we're going so I
[00:36:00] have started on both of them they're in
[00:36:02] the
[00:36:05] works
[00:36:10] yep where's the robin guy Jackass the oh
[00:36:13] second Channel Robin video is done I
[00:36:15] just need to public it look I have proof
[00:36:17] I have
[00:36:23] proof
[00:36:25] boom I just didn't title it or anything
[00:36:28] hello let's do the trial you know we'll
[00:36:30] see if I want to pull but but it's done
[00:36:33] it's done it's done it's not a guide
[00:36:36] it's just a robin
[00:36:39] video oh dude speaking of
[00:36:42] Robin speaking of Robin I think I have
[00:36:45] my best tweet of all time so okay wait
[00:36:49] so I okay first of
[00:36:55] all first of all I was I was playing
[00:36:57] Robin okay I tweeted
[00:37:12] this to
[00:37:17] my or maybe I'll take look it is what it
[00:37:20] is okay but like and then but then okay
[00:37:22] but but but I'm going to be honest like
[00:37:24] that's disrespectful to Robin I can't
[00:37:27] believe someone would do that uh anyone
[00:37:29] that does that deserves uh uh things
[00:37:31] that I can't say on stream and so I
[00:37:33] quote tweeted that with you don't
[00:37:35] [ __ ] deserve Robin if you can't
[00:37:37] appreciate her in her singing why did
[00:37:38] you pull for her let her sing you loser
[00:37:40] this is actually so annoying I hope you
[00:37:42] get Bao next banner and you remember
[00:37:44] this moment as a lesson to which Z
[00:37:46] replied bro chill he was just joking to
[00:37:48] which I replied shut the [ __ ]
[00:37:51] up
[00:37:53] okay dude dude the this quote tweet like
[00:37:57] trip ratioed the original or double
[00:38:03] ratioed also MK Leo the [ __ ] the
[00:38:06] smash player who I'm I'm a fan of by the
[00:38:09] way literally saw this retweeted it and
[00:38:12] then followed me back he follows me now
[00:38:15] the
[00:38:17] [ __ ] so I I don't know if he knows that
[00:38:20] this is I don't know but I mean w I
[00:38:22] guess F [ __ ] the guy that mute that
[00:38:24] muted Robin that's not me I've changed
[00:38:26] since then I would never you Robin I let
[00:38:28] her
[00:38:29] sing I would sing along with
[00:38:32] [Music]
[00:38:36] her or maybe I'll take it
[00:38:41] off
[00:38:43] anyways uh so that that's good content
[00:38:45] that's what happened um what is that
[00:38:47] damage dude it's unbuffed full up attack
[00:38:49] like do you expect it to do more this is
[00:38:51] why I need signatures in this [ __ ]
[00:38:53] [ __ ] ass game I'm sorry both games are
[00:38:55] [ __ ] all three games are [ __ ] when one
[00:38:57] was out every game's [ __ ] but dude you
[00:38:59] guys assume everyone has [ __ ] e a
[00:39:01] million Max investment signature lone
[00:39:03] all the time okay I'm sorry I'm
[00:39:06] relatable and guess what I like three
[00:39:08] cycled this wow
[00:39:11] sorry I'm sorry but this is why I'm
[00:39:15] forced to get topaz's lyone cuz of [ __ ]
[00:39:17] like
[00:39:17] you I'm sorry I'm sorry that was
[00:39:22] [ __ ] ice crew thanks for Prime thanks
[00:39:24] for all the subs I know I missed a bunch
[00:39:26] okay I will say though star rail is a
[00:39:28] lot more standard to have S1 than genon
[00:39:30] to have R1 I know weapon Banner is
[00:39:31] easier like Lyon Banner is better than
[00:39:32] weapon Banner but I think that's
[00:39:34] literally like you got we're getting
[00:39:35] brainwashed because oh lyone Banner is
[00:39:37] easier so I should pull so you end up
[00:39:38] spending more than you would even if the
[00:39:39] weapon Banner was worse because you're
[00:39:41] getting more lyones for less money so
[00:39:43] you're spending more money overall but
[00:39:45] you get more rewards so it's like better
[00:39:46] but it's like you're you're you're
[00:39:48] [ __ ] spending money but it is what it
[00:39:50] is
[00:39:54] anyways um
[00:40:02] is that it oh dude did you see okay no
[00:40:05] leaks no leaks no leaks in this channel
[00:40:08] but did you see the new 5.0 reactions
[00:40:11] magma pyro Geo burning Rock which is you
[00:40:14] have burning and then you apply Geo to
[00:40:16] it it's like a like hyper Bloom but for
[00:40:18] burning there's another one you can
[00:40:20] either apply Geo or anemo once there's a
[00:40:22] burning Aura on an enemy you can either
[00:40:24] Geo for burning rock or anemo for
[00:40:26] Heatwave or fire wind and then lastly D
[00:40:29] Gio is Mossy Rock there were rumors of
[00:40:31] windy plant but I think that like people
[00:40:34] were saying that but it's already in the
[00:40:35] game so you know uh yeah also DEA
[00:40:37] apparently Dia DEA is apparently going
[00:40:40] to come out so we'll see I don't know
[00:40:42] who she is probably a burning carry
[00:40:43] maybe a buron carry so pretty cool um
[00:40:46] yeah pretty cool by the way they're
[00:40:49] taking that tweet serious in gansin
[00:40:52] talk there's no way you're coping
[00:40:55] there's no way Tik Tok thinks the Tweet
[00:40:57] is real yeah link it link it what the I
[00:41:00] included brother I literally as I was
[00:41:03] chatting like me when I spread
[00:41:04] misinformation I was literally like just
[00:41:06] in case people think it's real I'm going
[00:41:08] to add this part just to make sure
[00:41:10] people like understand I added new pyro
[00:41:13] character DEA also
[00:41:16] rumored they posted on OK Zio okay well
[00:41:19] every road leads to [ __ ] OK ziox one
[00:41:22] second welcome to my oh
[00:41:30] okay but 480 likes like this is kind of
[00:41:32] a one guy some 5 okay I'm not a leaker

[00:41:38] hoyo Creator

[00:41:57] giving uh indirect Buffs to DEA which I
[00:42:00] think is cool okay you know nette good

[00:42:31] because that is some slander that I
[00:42:32] can't tolerate I've seen people spread
[00:42:33] misinformation about me and a lot of the
[00:42:35] times I'm not going to bother correcting
[00:42:37] it because it's not worth the effort but
[00:42:39] when you're [ __ ] posting a light mode
[00:42:41] screenshot I'm sorry buddy that slander
[00:42:44] will not be tolerated because it attacks
[00:42:46] me as a character and who I
[00:42:49] am I'm not a light mode
[00:42:52] user even my Microsoft Word is dark mode
[00:42:59] light Mode's better but sure yeah if you

[00:52:39] in genin cuz everyone oh oh oh your Dr
[00:52:42] ratio only has 80% chance cuz I'm
[00:52:45] playing a [ __ ] whale ass team okay
[00:52:47] I'm tired of being laughed at because
[00:52:49] every [ __ ] everyone has S1 except me
[00:52:59] hi this is to
[00:53:03] speaking
[00:53:05] hi so we're getting her
[00:53:07] lome um maybe do I even have Jades okay
[00:53:11] uh we might have to swipe it is what it
[00:53:12] is though uh her lione which reads the
[00:53:15] following worrisome Blissful hello hello
[00:53:20] I'm
[00:53:21] bad colon 3 oh worrisome blissful
[00:53:27] increase the wearer's crit rate by 18%
[00:53:29] and their full up attack damage by 30%
[00:53:31] after the wearer uses the full up attack
[00:53:33] apply the tame State stacking two times
[00:53:36] when allies had enemies under the tame
[00:53:37] state every tame State increases the
[00:53:39] crit damage dealt by 12%
[00:53:59] do I even want this lyone I didn't
[00:54:00] really think this
[00:54:08] through no
[00:54:14] yes dude this like code is literally
[00:54:17] what the [ __ ] YouTube short was
[00:54:18] talking about
[00:54:24] though oh I can't full screen it
[00:54:35] I don't even care about the Buffs I just
[00:54:36] like the debuff that's it like I I only
[00:54:38] care about the tame State I don't even
[00:54:40] care about anything else you think I
[00:54:42] care about my [ __ ] crit rate I mean I
[00:54:45] guess I do care
[00:54:53] but why her likeone particularly
[00:54:58] just because the team needs an extra
[00:54:59] debuff it's [ __ ] annoying doctor
[00:55:01] ratio is always on like 80% okay ignore
[00:55:03] my set doctor ratio is always on like
[00:55:11] 80% who are you using it on
[00:55:17] her wait am I going to get boot Hill's
[00:55:19] lyone oh [ __ ] wait we don't know what it
[00:55:21] does uh no surely not oh I might [ __ ]
[00:55:32] F
[00:55:36] [ __ ] is an 8% increase no it's not E1
[00:55:40] better for the team as a whole because
[00:55:41] it gives more doesn't matter E1 is
[00:55:43] irrelevant I'm never pulling an
[00:55:44] E1 like I'm not activating E1 I'm
[00:55:48] keeping my five stars
[00:55:54] ezero that's a good point however did

[01:03:18] saying that I'm not a brand
[01:03:21] risk I'm not I I play AFK Journey today
[01:03:25] EX Mark AFK J I think that was a that
[01:03:29] was a good sponsor it went well I'm
[01:03:30] still playing the game
[01:03:35] [Applause]
[01:03:41] today that was
[01:03:51] fun dude I've I've been watching I
[01:03:53] watched like some waa videos not not a
[01:03:56] lot but like a few some are informative
[01:03:58] and some are like the most basic [ __ ]
[01:04:00] which like is fair cuz it's a new game
[01:04:01] and like you're appealing to new players
[01:04:03] and but it's it's like every time I try
[01:04:04] to record a video as long as I'll say
[01:04:06] something I'll be like but people know
[01:04:08] this but then I have to realize that
[01:04:09] like there's also just people that have
[01:04:11] never played a game like this ever in
[01:04:12] their life so I kind of have to dumb it
[01:04:13] down so we'll see what I do I don't want
[01:04:16] I I don't know a boba level 123 oh
[01:04:19] that's not even the guy who subed I just
[01:04:20] noticed your name I'm sorry the real be
[01:04:21] five months H seven appreciate it
[01:04:39] but that I mean that's kind of how new
[01:04:40] games work like I'm I'm going to do like
[01:04:41] realistically if I do make content on it
[01:04:43] and like I've already started on one
[01:04:44] video I'd probably make a pretty
[01:04:47] beginner
[01:04:48] like not like full beginner but like you
[01:04:50] know like [ __ ] you should know to
[01:04:53] progress faster and then go more
[01:04:54] advanced if I if we still like the game
[01:04:58] because I think realistically second
[01:04:59] video I make is on all the five stars
[01:05:02] because I already know what they all do
[01:05:04] except one to be honest I don't know
[01:05:06] what the [ __ ] pink hair girl
[01:05:08] does but
[01:05:18] anyways do you do this for HSR for HSR I
[01:05:21] made uh best four stars you should use
[01:05:24] and guess the [ __ ] what [ __ ]
[01:05:26] guess the [ __ ] let me look this
[01:05:29] up
[01:05:32] Zio HSR four stars guess the [ __ ] what
[01:05:37] [ __ ] oh paila in the thumbnail
[01:05:40] oh he's always known yep yep he's known
[01:05:45] yep yeah he knew nah I'd
[01:05:49] come sorry I absolutely love because I
[01:05:53] believe the value she brings is oh oh
[01:05:55] what's up honestly kind of insane is
[01:05:57] primarily a debuffer as she is path and
[01:06:00] her main role is to reduce the defense
[01:06:02] of enemies this can be done through her
[01:06:03] ultimate or also through her technique
[01:06:05] outside of combat and the defense
[01:06:06] reduction that she applies is not only
[01:06:08] something that is quite significant with
[01:06:09] the exact numbers scaling up on your
[01:06:11] level but it's also something that will
[01:06:12] last for two turns and that will
[01:06:13] increase your damage significantly in
[01:06:15] most games that I've played defense
[01:06:17] reduction has always been not only
[01:06:18] valuable but also very rare and honkey
[01:06:20] star rail is no different true B in the
[01:06:22] team no it is what it is level 40 I
[01:06:26] can't dude this was like day four 3 2 1
[01:06:29] blast off it was literally the start of
[01:06:31] the game this is one year
[01:06:42] ago boot up what is this I can't even
[01:06:45] preview your link so whatever this is
[01:06:47] you might get me banned okay naked King
[01:06:51] what the [ __ ] is this chime said that
[01:06:53] with this
[01:06:57] I have truly become a king do you also
[01:06:59] see it that
[01:07:07] way Miner donated $1 we might play this
[01:07:11] game video before the stream start it's
[01:07:14] [ __ ] hilarious I can't get a link
[01:07:16] from a Dono but also I don't trust you
[01:07:18] not not that I don't trust you but I
[01:07:20] don't trust you like just putting it out
[01:07:21] straight you know I'm
[01:07:23] sorry Nik before Elder ring Ain't No

[01:07:46] oh oh are they just asking for a
[01:07:48] translation
[01:08:03] oil
[01:08:06] up okay that's enough of
[01:08:13] that can be done through her ultimate or
[01:08:15] also through her technique outside of
[01:08:16] combat and
[01:08:19] the okay how long do we have left what
[01:08:21] the [ __ ] do we do for 10 minutes

[01:09:46] you know I get it but I think S5 is the
[01:09:48] biggest waste of your entire life I'm
[01:09:50] sorry I'm sorry I said it cuz dude it
[01:09:52] doesn't even look different and the
[01:09:54] game's too easy for it to matter
[01:09:59] like E6 sure S5
[01:10:07] huh same with R5 and
[01:10:11] genin it gives you more HP which you
[01:10:13] have no buffers
[01:10:15] for I mean okay you know what for if
[01:10:18] you're doing it for your love for blade
[01:10:20] then
[01:10:23] sure is blade BL still irrelevant
[01:10:27] um okay I love blade to
[01:10:31] death he has really good AOE especially
[01:10:34] against wind weak enemies you can do a
[01:10:36] lot of cool things a lot of memory of
[01:10:38] chaoses recently have been kind of
[01:10:40] [ __ ] him over the last one honestly
[01:10:42] or the current one honestly you know he
[01:10:45] can I've cleared with him he's okay he's
[01:10:48] uh not at the top right now but I think
[01:10:49] he's going to have his comeback okay let
[01:10:51] me cope we're going to get an HP buffing
[01:10:53] support
[01:11:09] true
[01:11:10] ah
[01:11:14] ah
[01:11:16] [Music]
[01:11:22] Jesus here's a call out why don't you do
[01:11:25] the events in HSR so you don't have to
[01:11:27] spend okay I do the events the banner
[01:11:30] drops I do the
[01:11:33] events pause your music
[01:11:37] okay can we have zah I'm not adding zah
[01:11:40] is that the
[01:11:43] tree I'm not adding please I am
[01:11:48] begging I'm not adding Z
[01:11:57] okay I added
[01:12:02] zah wait is that the tree from Dad
[01:12:09] hung is but Vision break
[01:12:38] yeah I wish star rail was
[01:12:42] harder honestly I was going to say
[01:12:45] something cringe like I wish I was
[01:12:46] harder but I'm not going to say that I'm
[01:12:47] going to say something smart uh at least
[01:12:50] Stell gets like updates of like new
[01:12:52] endgame s content uh like there's a new
[01:12:56] like Hunt game mode coming out next
[01:12:57] patch next patch or 2.4 2.3 2.4 one of
[01:13:00] the patches so I think you can you can
[01:13:03] be a bit hopeful towards that memory of
[01:13:05] chaos also the enemies have been getting
[01:13:06] more HP
[01:13:10] so why does he know it liter is
[01:13:12] officially announced
[01:13:17] X got and hardit's the worst
[01:13:20] combo man the [ __ ] that's why I'm
[01:13:23] excited for this game if if they release
[01:13:25] wa and they're like nope just kidding
[01:13:27] it's [ __ ] baby o00 now I'm [ __ ]
[01:13:29] going to bed [ __ ] you I need something
[01:13:39] hard the only reason I'm excited is cuz
[01:13:41] the combat looks cool it looks
[01:13:44] relatively like dodging is important
[01:13:47] therefore you can show your skill off
[01:13:49] like skill matters somewhat that's two
[01:13:52] and three is it looks like there's hard
[01:13:54] content
[01:13:56] very good use of law
[01:14:00] education HP increase isn't hard content
[01:14:02] no I agree I I agree like it's in in
[01:14:05] genin and star rail sometimes mostly
[01:14:07] genin honestly sometimes we have to cope
[01:14:09] with like oh well the enemies have more
[01:14:10] HP so it's harder but like difficulty
[01:14:12] it's just difficulty should be rewarding
[01:14:15] if like you're like playing well
[01:14:17] characters for the exact same Reon no no
[01:14:18] I know I know I agree like that's why I
[01:14:21] liked when there's like you know swarm
[01:14:23] came out golden gears came out like this
[01:14:24] this is this right it's better than just
[01:14:27] [ __ ] oh here's more HP it's better
[01:14:29] there like okay well you have to [ __ ]
[01:14:30] don't get
[01:14:38] hit I don't know that's why like the
[01:14:41] really old this is a boomer take no
[01:14:43] one's going to remember but the really
[01:14:44] old 112 in the abyss was the best cuz it
[01:14:46] was like whales could if you're a whale
[01:14:49] you could like kind of cheese your way
[01:14:50] through it and then if you're free to
[01:14:51] play you could clear it easily like not
[01:14:53] easily but like if you know what you're
[01:14:54] doing your artifacts don't matter like
[01:14:56] you just need to be good which is cool
[01:14:58] cuz then if you're freet to play you can
[01:14:59] clear it and if you're whale you can
[01:15:00] clear it and if you're like well I have
[01:15:02] a headache I don't want to learn the
[01:15:03] game you can just swipe your credit card
[01:15:05] and then ventti and you you clear it
[01:15:07] which is probably I think best case
[01:15:09] scenario for gacha games is it's
[01:15:11] clearable if you're good and free to
[01:15:13] play or you can spend money and not have
[01:15:16] to use your brain because that's how
[01:15:17] they make money and they're like oh well
[01:15:18] if you have if you have [ __ ]
[01:15:19] constellation 6 every character like
[01:15:21] obviously you're not going to need to
[01:15:22] use your brain If you C6 and need to
[01:15:25] like if you have maxed every character
[01:15:27] and you need to use your brain then it's
[01:15:28] not realistic for like the average
[01:15:29] player so the the best middle ground is
[01:15:31] like it's hard but in a way that's not
[01:15:34] like oh well you need a specific [ __ ]
[01:15:36] character you need to swipe
[01:15:43] anyways Dalia clears Abyss dude what are
[01:15:46] you talking about watering waves is
[01:15:48] coming out soon so chat expect him to
[01:15:51] stream the 2.2 quest of pride month
[01:15:55] dude hey every month is pride month okay
[01:15:59] you don't need it's not just one month
[01:16:02] okay every month is is women's month for
[01:16:07] me
[01:16:13] okay dude last year I remember I was at
[01:16:16] a hotel for something it was either
[01:16:18] Anime Expo or some convention and like
[01:16:21] they had like this hotel had like a tree
[01:16:23] not a tree but like I don't they had
[01:16:25] like a bunch of like decorations with
[01:16:27] like Pride flags and [ __ ] and then I
[01:16:28] swear to God July 1st at like midnight
[01:16:31] like I was just like walking I was like
[01:16:32] 12:30 they like took everything down I
[01:16:35] was like H POG or not
[01:16:39] POG don't you need HMC for Boot Hill for
[01:16:41] legal reasons I cannot answer that
[01:16:43] question yet stay tuned for my guide but
[01:16:45] um just know
[01:16:51] that i' win
[01:16:59] full screen we will full screen it I
[01:17:01] mean are we just waiting I guess we're

[01:17:05] waiting let me close my Google Chrome so
[01:17:07] I don't lag at all I'll close star rail
[01:17:09] too I'm just going to minimize any risk

[01:17:35] true
[01:17:38] true are you pulling Firefly once he
[01:17:40] comes out okay better here's a better
[01:17:42] way to format your question first of all
[01:17:44] I pull for every character now if you
[01:17:45] meant like are you excited for Firefly
[01:17:47] are you looking forward to her do you
[01:17:48] want to get her yes I think
[01:17:51] Firefly and the other character leaks
[01:17:53] well not leaks but like I don't want to
[01:17:54] spoil the quest if we didn't do it look
[01:17:56] very cool I'm excited for
[01:18:05] Firefly if Firefly was just Firefly I'd
[01:18:08] be like but because Firefly is also the
[01:18:12] other character I'm I'm
[01:18:19] pogging it's on her drip marketing yeah
[01:18:21] I mean everyone
[01:18:23] knows I just do a g there someone in

[01:19:07] didn't expect most people like I didn't
[01:19:09] expect I didn't expect so many people to
[01:19:11] like Star rail's like combat as well cuz
[01:19:14] I didn't expect turnbas combat to be
[01:19:17] like um not popular but like accepted by

[01:19:22] dungeon and [ __ ] like I I don't I I

[01:26:28] shape we shouldn't stay here if you
[01:26:31] don't have other plans how about leaving
[01:26:34] with us for
[01:26:36] now yeah let's get
[01:26:39] going

[01:27:22] mean I should wait that was him no was
[01:27:24] only my second time cosplaying okay
[01:27:27] maybe I'm just dumb I'm sorry I didn't I
[01:27:29] didn't know who Rex was what was the
[01:27:30] other time you cosplay I only know Rex
[01:27:32] at Gamescom for the same character if
[01:27:35] you some of you remember in Gamescom I
[01:27:37] also cosplay as Youngy but that was more
[01:27:39] of a joke that's cool now they think
[01:27:41] like oh the reception is pretty good do
[01:27:43] it again like okay fine your jerk must
[01:27:46] have been taken very seriously more
[01:27:48] characters in the future I don't know
[01:27:51] maybe 10 used to cosplay ventti every
[01:27:54] and each he' lose like aie he'd be like
[01:27:57] less and lth it was kind of
[01:27:59] fcked you definitely should I think you
[01:28:02] have some untapped cosplay potential I'm
[01:28:04] not meaning like I wouldn't make that up
[01:28:05] that's actually true maybe I should
[01:28:07] consider it you might be going for Z job
[01:28:09] after this and you know practice makes
[01:28:11] perfect after all I I wouldn't be
[01:28:13] surprised if you told me that this was

[01:28:17] there going to be a lot more surprises

[01:47:15] initial thoughts after watching I think
[01:47:16] they're really cool I can't believe it
[01:47:18] like we already have challenging bosses
[01:47:19] and they're adding more I'm looking
[01:47:21] forward to fighting them yeah after what
[01:47:23] I saw I'm looking forward to fighting
[01:47:24] that one as well I know right yeah
[01:47:26] especially the last boss that appeared
[01:47:28] it seems like a monster that didn't
[01:47:29] appear in the previous betas it's great
[01:47:31] that you mentioned that because the dev
[01:47:33] team is actually provided us with some
[01:47:35] information about we give everyone a
[01:47:37] quick sneak peek sure so it's called the
[01:47:39] dreamless it's a mysterious entity that
[01:47:42] the send North for bar and it's one of
[01:47:45] the anomalies of the Dual moons so it
[01:47:47] takes the form of a sphere and is
[01:47:50] identified as a thodum during its dorant
[01:47:52] stage now due to its continuously
[01:47:55] escalating internal energy surges the
[01:47:58] possible detection methods against it
[01:47:59] have failed so Threat Level is you know
[01:48:02] can't can't really tell what that looks
[01:48:04] like very powerful yeah so I believe
[01:48:06] that comenting as the strong enemy will
[01:48:07] definitely give everyone a really
[01:48:08] thrilling and rewarding experience
[01:48:10] especially for the players yeah so quite
[01:48:13] a few cool things being added into v1.0
[01:48:15] we've covered the monsters and a few
[01:48:16] sneak Peaks here and there now time for

[01:50:56] Yin oh nice nice respect now that you
[01:51:00] all have your characters did I hear
[01:51:02] someone say mommy or did I hallucinate
[01:51:04] one of the voice lines from the game and
[01:51:07] you just have to dub it over I mean it's
[01:51:09] that simple yeah sounds easy I don't
[01:51:11] think it's it's going to be that simple
[01:51:12] you're going crazy I swear she like
[01:51:15] whispered it never that simple of Min
[01:51:17] games there's a catch as you can see
[01:51:19] behind me there are balloons the
[01:51:20] balloons are floating so this is going
[01:51:22] to be a helium dubbing someone said it
[01:51:24] okay I see where it is have to dub it
[01:51:26] through helium voices we're going to
[01:51:27] raise your pitch and uh we're going to
[01:51:29] make this a little bit of a contest now
[01:51:31] if you have to stop halfway that counts
[01:51:34] as a failure if you can't complete the
[01:51:36] lines in time before the healing runs
[01:51:37] out that counts as a failure as well
[01:51:38] we'll give everyone two tries if you
[01:51:40] need it you get two are they sucking
[01:51:43] helium from a balloon another chance and
[01:51:46] then we can judge which ones are the
[01:51:47] best later and award the stickers
[01:51:49] accordingly to everyone there great this
[01:51:51] seems like your Forte Rebecca you have
[01:51:52] an advantage over us oh I don't know
[01:51:55] about that I mean I I don't normally
[01:51:56] voice an helium so I'll try though oh at
[01:52:00] least there more chances for stickers
[01:52:02] yeah more chances for stickers right so
[01:52:04] you you're going to get a sticker this
[01:52:05] time right I don't even need helium

[01:52:11] you help me out mister I'm going to be

[01:55:46] ventriloquist to pretend like they're

[01:59:47] five-star resonator after up to 80
[01:59:50] convenes with a 50% chance to get the
[01:59:53] featur if the resonator is not the
[01:59:55] featured
[01:59:56] resonator festar resonator is not my
[01:59:59] first buddy to be the featured resonator
[02:00:02] in the weapon convene event after up to
[02:00:04] 80 convenes players are guaranteed to
[02:00:06] obtain the featured five-star weapon and
[02:00:08] the obtained five-star weapon is
[02:00:10] guaranteed to be the featured weapon
[02:00:12] cool cool also there will be featured
[02:00:15] five-star resonator trials during the
[02:00:16] character convene event players can how
[02:00:19] did that weapon thing work their skills
[02:00:22] guarante players can also use lustrous
[02:00:25] tide in the standard cavine to obtain
[02:00:26] resonators and weapons to boost the
[02:00:29] strength for battle in standard weapon
[02:00:31] convene players can select a fstar
[02:00:32] weapon for targeted convene the selected
[02:00:35] festar weapon can be switched any time
[02:00:37] during convene and when obtaining a
[02:00:39] fivar weapon no 5050 on the weap yeah
[02:00:41] yeah that's really coolar weapon after
[02:00:44] obtaining the selected weapon players
[02:00:45] can continue to switch targets for
[02:00:47] Target it convenes wow W that's
[02:00:50] cool we'll we'll see if I like the
[02:00:53] weapon banners or not in this game I'm
[02:00:54] usually a weapon B but to make it easier
[02:00:57] for players to resonators we will
[02:00:59] introduce a beginner convene event
[02:01:01] players can use lustrous tie to
[02:01:03] participate in the utterance of Marvels
[02:01:05] the beginner convene event in this event
[02:01:07] every 50 summons guarantee a festar
[02:01:10] resonator yep the conv cost two attempts
[02:01:12] less and I got Le sorry is that his name
[02:01:15] I forgot his name I don't know what his
[02:01:16] name is the [ __ ] lion boy what his
[02:01:19] name 40 to obtain a festar res
[02:01:23] that sounds good but these are all just
[02:01:25] regular content isn't it that's true
[02:01:27] yeah I feel like many players might not
[02:01:30] is there any kind of like media bonuses
[02:01:32] they can get well I'll introduce the
[02:01:35] bonuses oh while we're kicking off both
[02:01:38] the character convene event and the
[02:01:40] beginner convene at the same time it'd
[02:01:43] be a bummer if we couldn't get the
[02:01:44] resonators we W but here is the solution
[02:01:48] oh after obtaining a five-star resonator
[02:01:51] from the
[02:01:52] the beginner Five Star Choice will
[02:01:55] follow here players can pick their
[02:01:58] favorite standard give me my for
[02:02:01] targeted conven pick y with up to 80
[02:02:04] conven they're guaranteed to get you
[02:02:06] have to do 80 up to 80 PS and then you
[02:02:08] get a five star can NAB at least two
[02:02:10] five star resonators from these
[02:02:12] events two five stars guess we don't
[02:02:15] have to one that you hate and then one
[02:02:17] that you want I me additionally and
[02:02:19] there is an additionally players can
[02:02:22] also obtain Afterglow Coral or
[02:02:24] oscillated Coral as extra items during
[02:02:28] convene Afterglow Coral can be exchanged
[02:02:31] for resonator wave bands of standard twe
[02:02:33] is that what they did in starl though on
[02:02:35] the standard you pick or is this
[02:02:36] different p and other valuable items
[02:02:38] might be different P Coral can be
[02:02:40] exchanged for convene tokens and
[02:02:42] development materials during each event
[02:02:44] that that means you can accumulate
[02:02:46] [ __ ] 300 never mind one
[02:02:49] [ __ ] won't expire cool I chose theing
[02:02:53] this is great is there anything else

[02:07:33] remember this character I remember the
[02:07:35] physics of this character for the
[02:07:37] ministry of development in jino though
[02:07:39] she seems laidback taoi is in fact a
[02:07:42] strong and reliable presence in jino and
[02:07:45] a constant support to the city's defense
[02:07:48] but perhaps more importantly she's a
[02:07:50] good listener and is always willing to
[02:07:52] help people in trouble weing waves is
[02:07:56] already a fantastic game I can by the
[02:07:59] team to create brilliant character I
[02:08:01] respect amazing Graphics story lines
[02:08:04] sound design and combat mechanics I'm
[02:08:07] excited for you the player to delve into
[02:08:09] the world time to
[02:08:13] work no more glazing around there around
[02:08:16] then true all righty just so I mentioned
[02:08:19] before that video it is time for yet
[02:08:21] another mini game more chances to
[02:08:24] win so if you want to immerse yourself
[02:08:27] into the world of withering waves you
[02:08:29] have to immerse yourself into its
[02:08:30] Delicacies and cine as well so I have
[02:08:34] some of the food items from the game I'm
[02:08:36] about to bring that over for everyone
[02:08:39] goodness mini game hearty luk
[02:08:44] buns long so here we have the long buns
[02:08:47] from withering waves and everyone here
[02:08:50] is going they Del to try
[02:08:54] them there we go they're really cute I
[02:08:57] have to yo bro we've been recording for
[02:08:59] like 10 hours these are cold they look
[02:09:00] really good but is there a catch oh no
[02:09:03] there's never catch in these games but
[02:09:06] you know the attention is in the detail
[02:09:09] of the food because the design of the
[02:09:11] game is remarkable so among these four
[02:09:13] long buns though um one of them might
[02:09:16] contain Wasabi but that's just a small
[02:09:18] thing EXC wait what s what it's fine one
[02:09:21] of them might just might have Wasabi you
[02:09:23] know a bit of extra flavor is is that
[02:09:25] why there is water uh it could be
[02:09:28] possibly but what's going to happen in
[02:09:29] this mini game is you're going to take a
[02:09:32] bite of your long fun and the other
[02:09:34] three contestants are going to have to
[02:09:37] choose [ __ ]
[02:09:39] music out of the Wasabi long
[02:09:42] bun if you do have the Wasabi long bun
[02:09:45] your goal is to not get as the most
[02:09:48] number of votes get as little votes as
[02:09:50] possible hide the fact that you have the
[02:09:52] Wasabi long bun so you have to fake it
[02:09:54] you pretty much have to fake it exactly
[02:09:57] so basically this is where acting comes
[02:10:00] in right I guess right Advantage what
[02:10:03] some actors do is you uh you pluck a
[02:10:05] hair from your if you have you got the
[02:10:08] least amount of votes you also get like
[02:10:10] nether region and then it Waters up your
[02:10:11] eyes it's a thing like actual actors do
[02:10:13] this when they want a fake cry you do
[02:10:14] that and then it like makes your eyes
[02:10:16] watery so then you can like pretend that
[02:10:17] like your like your mouth is burning
[02:10:20] it's the thing I'm not I don't do I'm
[02:10:21] just saying it's a
[02:10:22] thing have done it ladies first there's
[02:10:25] like an interview with like Emma I don't
[02:10:27] know who someone I think it was a guy
[02:10:28] actually wish me luck guys good luck Tom
[02:10:31] Cruz let's see
[02:10:34] um oh sneaky one that's turned away from
[02:10:38] me okay let's see got to check for the
[02:10:40] micro Expressions I have to stick this
[02:10:42] all in my mouth and we go y

[02:10:50] die and I'm good at spce like I eat
[02:10:52] wasabi peas for fun delicious iroll or
[02:10:55] Wasabi
[02:11:03] oh oh no this is a tough
[02:11:08] one it's good
[02:11:11] M okay see like okay yo how much Wasabi
[02:11:14] is there though if it's full of Wasabi
[02:11:15] she's faking if it's just a drop it

[02:11:19] we all have our turns first then
[02:11:21] she's a little sus I just don't know how
[02:11:23] much Wasabi there is give time we're
[02:11:26] just we're just giving you some time
[02:11:27] some space I feel like they wouldn't put
[02:11:29] that much like I've been on sets where
[02:11:31] they're like like you know like porn

[02:11:51] that I'm

[02:12:31] us to hide that you have Wasabi by the
[02:12:35] way this a high
[02:12:41] situation or it's very good acting
[02:12:45] I I still can't is it one sec sorry

[02:13:44] fake I think Rex me's moment as well I
[02:13:47] right is it just maybe there just one
[02:13:49] the normal time maybe lock down oh yeah
[02:13:52] what if all of them have either no
[02:13:54] Wasabi or they all have
[02:13:56] Wasabi I don't know whatever I'm
[02:13:58] thinking too hard it's a [ __ ] it's a
[02:14:00] why do I why am I so
[02:14:02] invested totally oh I see I see the
[02:14:05] Wasabi in those eyes maybe they all have
[02:14:06] Wasabi
[02:14:07] [ __ ] eyes are watering all right okay
[02:14:10] honestly maybe cuz his eyes looked red
[02:14:12] too I'm talking big here but what what
[02:14:14] if I actually get the Wasabi okay let's
[02:14:16] see then we see the Wasabi
[02:14:18] face everyone's pretending like that was
[02:14:21] so far I know
[02:14:22] okay but I I I it's a nice soft
[02:14:31] bun already you haven't
[02:14:35] chewed what if you just swallow it what
[02:14:38] if you don't
[02:14:41] chew a hint of Wasabi
[02:14:44] maybe to be fair this is the most normal
[02:14:48] reaction okay yeah I eat a lot of that
[02:14:51] don't do that don't do that throughout
[02:14:53] he's like appreciating the
[02:14:56] undertones the Woody undertones
[02:14:59] crinkling of the forehead oh
[02:15:02] good or he's just like you know Manning
[02:15:05] up to do this it's like he tasted it for
[02:15:08] the first time in his
[02:15:12] life yeah do you need some water all
[02:15:14] good
[02:15:16] yeah if they actually all have Wasabi
[02:15:19] this guy Ted the end of the final mini
[02:15:20] game if to give out so let's figure out
[02:15:23] who is the winner we know is a second
[02:15:25] one winner or maybe it's a team effort
[02:15:28] you got more votes let's see if the
[02:15:29] Imposter can found out all you have to
[02:15:31] do is point out who you think is the
[02:15:32] Imposter who had the Wasabi on my count
[02:15:35] 3 2 1 you 3 two 1 Rex
[02:15:40] Rebecca ah okay so two votes over to
[02:15:44] Rebecca one to zik and one over to Rex
[02:15:47] so it's just coming down to was Rebecca
[02:15:50] the Imposter Rebecca why why why are you
[02:15:52] making the vote you made well because um
[02:15:56] you know when ziki was eating the cake
[02:15:58] she looked like she was in anguish and
[02:16:00] she and I thought it was you know a bit
[02:16:02] sneaky cuz she had a hand over her mouth
[02:16:04] so we couldn't really see it so I'm like
[02:16:05] like very believable yeah okay Rex you
[02:16:09] think it's Rebecca why same reason I
[02:16:13] don't know if that's an act or actually
[02:16:15] consuming the Wasabi but it was quite
[02:16:18] believable okay well well I mean you
[02:16:20] didn't get any votes towards you so if
[02:16:22] you're the Imposter you might be getting
[02:16:23] a sticker yourself but why why'd you
[02:16:25] vote for Rex when he was eating it his
[02:16:28] eyes were so red and they were Waring he
[02:16:30] looked like he wanted to cry those were
[02:16:32] the tears of Wasabi it is not Rex it is
[02:16:35] it is not Rex buddy from where I'm
[02:16:37] sitting it all it look like if it's
[02:16:38] everyone I'm pissed [ __ ] it I'm all in
[02:16:40] it's not
[02:16:41] Rex all right now he's a gacha gamer
[02:16:44] he's like yeah I was fighting the bosses
[02:16:46] Wasabi's not going to hurt
[02:16:47] him he's lost like more 50/50s than he
[02:16:50] can
[02:16:51] it was me oh re I lied never mind I had
[02:16:55] the Wasabi told you I knew it wow
[02:16:58] congratulations you won as the impos
[02:17:01] okay he tanked it though he tanked it he
[02:17:03] tanked it it was very convincing though
[02:17:05] do you have anything to say it's cuz
[02:17:08] that was definitely a two biter okay I
[02:17:10] was like I couldn't dude she stopped
[02:17:13] chewing I thought it was like spice I
[02:17:14] need to spit it out there's too much
[02:17:16] different kind of Anguish yeah that's
[02:17:19] you want a sticker here we go

[02:17:29] say this but you don't get a sticker and
[02:17:32] you know this is the first time that
[02:17:33] it's it's been completely out of your
[02:17:37] control you guessed the right person but
[02:17:40] it's a majority battle and it's the

[02:25:25] and I'm the voice actor for yinlin
[02:25:27] yinlin is a wielder of electric power
[02:25:30] she gives off an impression of ambiguity
[02:25:33] whilst achieving her own goals wait
[02:25:35] they're doing the asymmetry again in
[02:25:36] moments of conflict she always does
[02:25:39] what's right I'm excited for players to
[02:25:42] delve into the world and most
[02:25:44] importantly meet yinlin I will make good
[02:25:48] use of this power and fight by your side
[02:25:51] we'll confront evil wherever it lies yes
[02:25:55] ma'am all right now it is time to tally
[02:25:59] up all the stickers that we have because
[02:26:00] that was the we don't have any more mini
[02:26:02] games we're going on to the final game
[02:26:04] that we have wait no more Min games
[02:26:05] there's a final game so introduce that
[02:26:07] to you first before we tally everything
[02:26:09] up so now that they've all concluded
[02:26:11] everyone's going to be playing in a demo
[02:26:13] session of withering waves and you're
[02:26:15] going to is that me like or is it just
[02:26:17] the
[02:26:18] people to defeat the boss wins MH now
[02:26:21] this is why the stickers were important
[02:26:23] so let's first quickly tally up those
[02:26:24] stickers so Rex I have four stickers
[02:26:27] four all right how many do you have I
[02:26:30] have three three Rebecca three stickers
[02:26:34] and two okay so you remember how things
[02:26:38] just keep getting worse and worse for
[02:26:40] you I hate to break into you it's just
[02:26:42] somehow even gotten even worse than it
[02:26:43] was meant to be so there's a first
[02:26:46] second third and fourth place here so
[02:26:48] Rex as the first place with number of
[02:26:51] stickers there's going to be no time
[02:26:52] penalty added to your clear of the box
[02:26:55] now there was a second and third time
[02:26:57] penalty but because you both play second
[02:27:01] you only get I did a Boss Rush at twitch
[02:27:04] that third place time has to go
[02:27:05] somewhere and fob threw up on stage and
[02:27:08] since he hasn't been invited to any
[02:27:10] event so free my man please he's a good
[02:27:13] person let the withering RS boss
[02:27:15] challenge begin
[02:27:24] all right wait Rex got yeah Rex got no
[02:27:27] penalty but he's a gamer for the final
[02:27:29] challenge of the night so we have two
[02:27:32] computers set up now in front of us
[02:27:33] which means we're going into the bus
[02:27:36] challenge so no more stickers to collect
[02:27:39] unfortunately we don't have any more to
[02:27:40] give out but your stickers do
[02:27:42] matter again not
[02:27:45] as at the moment so Rex you've got no
[02:27:48] time penalty girls you got 5 Seconds of
[02:27:50] a Time
[02:27:52] penalty and then 15 seconds of a Time
[02:27:54] penalty at the moment you got this aen
[02:27:57] but since both girls have the same
[02:27:59] amount of stickers we'll let you pick do
[02:28:00] you want to play against each other or
[02:28:01] you want to challenge the guys I like
[02:28:03] the challenge against the guys what do
[02:28:05] you think yeah I'm done to challenge

[02:30:39] going into this one that uh even though
[02:30:41] you got all your stickers yes I feel
[02:30:43] like there's a really really strong
[02:30:45] handicap that's about to take place yes
[02:30:48] I feel it too I feel it too and also at
[02:30:51] the same time I feel like there might be
[02:30:53] no handicap on this side but are you
[02:30:55] going to assist um in making sure that
[02:30:57] Zack perform as well possibly I might
[02:30:59] use the same tactic back me up right I

[02:31:18] on get there quickly all right both
[02:31:20] players are good to go so we can start
[02:31:22] in three 2 1 go wait why there's only
[02:31:26] two characters what did you
[02:31:29] do
[02:31:31] okay I'm analyzing the game
[02:31:33] [Laughter]
[02:31:40] play lucky no Dodge there magically
[02:31:44] switch every now and then but still
[02:31:47] going good for Z getting some good
[02:31:49] damage Rebecca's now joining the fre I
[02:31:51] didn't do anything out
[02:31:54] of okay Rex is kind of
[02:31:59] gaming what's going on
[02:32:02] there but you're know out of this a
[02:32:04] gamer you still have
[02:32:06] alls still lots of
[02:32:10] time okay I love Gan he's going to be my
[02:32:14] main but this guy looks uh like the
[02:32:17] easiest character I've ever seen in my
[02:32:18] life all right
[02:32:20] those players are successful you just
[02:32:22] buff you literally
[02:32:24] just 50 plus 5 55 seconds and you dodge
[02:32:28] somehow survives the earthquake and gets
[02:32:30] a time of 32 seconds Z the
[02:32:34] champion all right I could be wrong
[02:32:37] though I lost my 50/50 in the beta so I
[02:32:39] never played him full disclosure I lost
[02:32:41] my 5050 in the beta the grand
[02:32:46] too how how do you feel about that match
[02:32:48] so cuz you still performing really well
[02:32:51] yeah I think for my first time playing
[02:32:52] it was like pretty fun um I I I passed
[02:32:56] so it's okay did good I mean and what
[02:32:58] happened was qu not strong
[02:33:01] enough he had a slight Advantage after
[02:33:04] res guys in Star beta remember I got
[02:33:06] unlucky and then when the game came out
[02:33:08] I got Ste lead one one single pull final
[02:33:11] match today it's going to be the finals
[02:33:14] Rex playing against Rebecca because it's
[02:33:17] the grand finals there are no time
[02:33:19] penalties oh so it's an even this time
[02:33:22] round go ahead can start your

[02:33:49] strategy Chang I'm watching this game
[02:33:51] play no no K kill kill kill y oh out
[02:33:56] skill use the
[02:33:58] thing re strategy is still working
[02:34:00] there's the
[02:34:05] Parry oh neither player taking damage so
[02:34:09] fast
[02:34:12] another oh yeah g also has a character
[02:34:14] that I know he's like Super Omega like
[02:34:17] alt dependent so if you start the fight
[02:34:18] without it it's like annoying to up what
[02:34:20] I think we're see I could
[02:34:22] be look like it's almost now almost oh
[02:34:26] it's vulnerable all right he gets the
[02:34:27] like this is like peanuts until he
[02:34:29] [ __ ] presses the
[02:34:31] button Yang aled twice on the
[02:34:39] left hello
[02:34:43] hello down going to do enough damage not
[02:34:45] yet but doing really well so
[02:34:48] far re going much further into the lead
[02:34:51] Rebecca this
[02:34:54] is that was a good Parry okay that
[02:34:58] impressive re DOD everything but Rex Rex
[02:35:01] is successful in this challenge now
[02:35:03] let's see if Rebecca sming P true
[02:35:06] got nice Parry really nice come let's do
[02:35:11] it let's do it remember kill kill kill

[02:35:17] the that is like his a very press R

[02:35:34] Parry he's going to be
[02:35:39] him really close no you wouldn't yes I
[02:35:42] would that was very good for a first
[02:35:44] attempt that boss is actually more
[02:35:46] advanced than the one previously with
[02:35:50] because I already and yeah like all the
[02:35:53] Perry Rings coming up I know I even
[02:35:57] Perry I think you caught more than
[02:35:59] me one of the strongest attacks that he
[02:36:01] had I know but there was a hurricane on
[02:36:03] my
[02:36:07] side you you heard it from Rex you know
[02:36:09] we changed the boss for the final round
[02:36:11] so even though how does break work in
[02:36:13] this game in the beta so it's not
[02:36:15] reflective of how difficult the game is
[02:36:17] going to be when it does come out but

[02:49:49] anyways how was win trace it was fun but
[02:49:51] I feel bad cuz my recording got cooked
[02:49:56] um I I basically got first well I got
[02:49:59] second because fob was like basically
[02:50:01] cheating he wasn't cheating but he's
[02:50:02] like I play the game six hours a day
[02:50:05] every day since it's out dude I was
[02:50:07] literally juking him but he saw my
[02:50:10] footsteps in the grass when I was
[02:50:11] invisible cuz he's like I didn't even
[02:50:13] know that was a mechanic that's one two
[02:50:15] um my POV is [ __ ] now cuz the recording
[02:50:17] [ __ ] but there was one time as a
[02:50:19] hunter I lost but like the only reason I
[02:50:21] lost I had a win guaranteed but like he
[02:50:23] was right next to me I pressed e it
[02:50:25] didn't capture him cuz ping it was
[02:50:26] literally a ping diff and then so I got
[02:50:28] like I I it just [ __ ] up but like I
[02:50:30] would have won if I caught him anyways
[02:50:33] it is what it
[02:50:36] is um wait let me show you guys this
[02:50:43] again
[02:50:46] um so you lost
[02:50:49] dude the recording though actually
[02:50:51] [ __ ] up I feel bad like I literally
[02:50:53] recorded but because it was on the same
[02:50:55] modder as genin I'm on a shitty ass
