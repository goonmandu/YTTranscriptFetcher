[00:09:30] speed versus attack the more the ANS is
[00:09:32] just pick whichever one you want and so
[00:09:35] the the longer you learn the more you
[00:09:36] learn about it the overly complicated
[00:09:38] you make it and then doesn't help
[00:09:45] [Music]
[00:09:47] people although I will say I think speed
[00:09:51] always on every character always
[00:09:54] is not always the best but well not sely

[00:19:44] the Primes I'll go through them later I
[00:19:46] probably won't but I appreciate it okay
[00:19:47] uh okay a lot to do first of
[00:19:51] all let me do something really quick
[00:19:54] please don't get mad at me for what I'm
[00:19:55] about to do okay first of all
[00:20:03] one second let me just build a
[00:20:06] team okay can we get one rip Bozo to
[00:20:10] anyone pulling for Ron May right now who
[00:20:12] doesn't have the sorry anyone pulling
[00:20:13] for black one who doesn't have these
[00:20:14] characters can we just get one rib Bozo
[00:20:16] for them very quickly very quickly okay
[00:20:19] thank you anyways we're going to play
[00:20:20] this team um but we're going to wait I
[00:20:23] didn't enable it but we're going to pull
[00:20:25] for the character
[00:20:27] first
[00:20:37] if you you can use another healer it's
[00:20:38] fine the Healer slot is
[00:20:41] flexible well was nice though cuz so the
[00:20:43] thing with Black Swan that you may
[00:20:45] notice when you play her is you get your
[00:20:46] alt around once per two or three patches
[00:20:49] so having quo giving you 20 energy lets
[00:20:51] you get your alt a turn sooner which is
[00:20:53] pretty nice uh but even without ho you
[00:20:55] could use like lra or fuen it's fine or
[00:20:58] like
[00:20:59] links but lra is nice for skill points
[00:21:02] anyways oh black
[00:21:19] one inor reforge
[00:21:25] remembrance oh yeah Chad you guys want
[00:21:27] to see something Bud look at this [ __ ]
[00:21:29] look at this [ __ ] you guys want to see
[00:21:30] what light code I can use on her let me
[00:21:33] click on an nihility character okay let
[00:21:35] me click on an ail character let's look
[00:21:37] at the lones I have I
[00:21:39] have four four stars that's it so I
[00:21:44] can't take this off Pila I can't like I
[00:21:46] need the back lone for someone else so I
[00:21:48] have an S2 [ __ ] eyes of the prey
[00:21:53] S2 it's fine it's fine
[00:21:59] so the other lyones like herd as chop or
[00:22:01] the new memory of chaos one I know
[00:22:02] people are going to spam it but since I
[00:22:04] actually research for this guide I can
[00:22:05] actually roast the people that are back
[00:22:07] seating right now those can sometimes
[00:22:09] technically be better but you need like
[00:22:11] 60 EHR on your relics you literally need
[00:22:13] like [ __ ] the most hit rate if you
[00:22:15] don't have a hit rate lone so I kind of
[00:22:17] don't ever want to do that to me ever
[00:22:19] again in my life like I don't want to
[00:22:21] run a character that needs like 120 hit
[00:22:23] rate and go relics for all of that hit
[00:22:26] rate except you get 10 from your uh
[00:22:29] passes anyways let's
[00:22:33] pull her lon's insane yes but it's worse
[00:22:35] than E1 so I would get made fun of for
[00:22:37] pulling for it it like it is a good lone
[00:22:42] but no so what I was thinking also give
[00:22:47] me a second chat I now this isn't really
[00:22:49] great for her but I kind of want to get
[00:22:51] this for someone like I'm probably going
[00:22:53] to level wealth I'm probably like I kind
[00:22:55] of want to just get it because I have
[00:22:56] the
[00:22:56] currency
[00:22:58] um but I wouldn't use it right now
[00:23:00] anyways I could give it to one of my
[00:23:02] other
[00:23:03] characters cuz it is a stat stick like
[00:23:05] it's not
[00:23:08] bad but
[00:23:10] yeah I don't
[00:23:13] know sup pretty boy okay is it wels
[00:23:17] weapon good for Black Swan Once Again
[00:23:19] weapons without effect hit rate make you
[00:23:21] want a effect jump off a cliff sorry in
[00:23:24] game but it's not bad it's like the
[00:23:26] effect only works for your skill so it
[00:23:27] doesn't actually work but it's it's
[00:23:28] still a stattic it's good will it like
[00:23:30] math pretty high on the ranking probably
[00:23:32] it's decent but you like it is really
[00:23:35] hard to build her if you don't have hit
[00:23:37] on your Lon that's all but it's good
[00:23:39] okay we're going to pull
[00:23:40] her uh also I didn't buy anything from
[00:23:42] the uh shop so we're going to get these
[00:23:44] for free whoa
[00:23:47] pulls there's sample profile picture in
[00:23:49] the battle pass wait
[00:23:52] really that should look like the battle
[00:23:55] pass Google show me this guy's
[00:23:58] balls
[00:24:01] um that is very cute okay that is also
[00:24:05] very cute that's Lin
[00:24:07] cor probably not going to get it though
[00:24:09] I usually don't buy the second one I
[00:24:11] already have my blade uh pfp okay let's
[00:24:14] pull let's pull
[00:24:17] F3 that hung ill Black Swan as a carry
[00:24:20] and VI but if you're playing dot teams
[00:24:22] then uh Black Swan is good like if you
[00:24:24] have Kafka and you like Kafka get Black
[00:24:25] Swan if you don't have Kafka or like
[00:24:28] main like if maybe you main sample or
[00:24:29] something uh well unless you like main
[00:24:32] sample or something I would I would I

[00:43:58] hung and I still like de hung but yeah
[00:44:00] no it's not even
[00:44:02] close de hung's probably second dead
[00:44:04] hung and Kafka I think Kafka is also
[00:44:06] really
[00:44:08] close and Black Swan is is like a bit
[00:44:11] under
[00:44:12] Kafka are devils I'll crush them all
[00:44:16] time to say bye boom
[00:44:21] boom PR a PR play a freeo play Team no
[00:44:25] if playing a free to play Team I don't
[00:44:27] recommend Black Swan but you if you have
[00:44:29] E4 sampo E4 sampo isn't really free play
[00:44:31] you could use like G fan who you might
[00:44:33] get on the banner that could be
[00:44:34] considered like free to play but um yeah
[00:44:38] she's a lot better with
[00:44:42] cro also I don't want to Auto Battle
[00:44:44] today we will be manually playing but
[00:44:45] for traces we probably don't need
[00:44:50] to wait how do I say your name is it not
[00:44:52] that sex alarm relax new player who I
[00:44:56] pull
[00:44:57] for honestly probably Sparkle I okay you
[00:45:01] guys going to type Suk I actually don't
[00:45:03] know what Sparkle does yet but probably
[00:45:05] Sparkle however um be swept away by the
[00:45:08] wind like realistically a Quantum
[00:45:10] Harmony support as long as she's good
[00:45:12] will will be better value for your
[00:45:13] account but having good DPSS in this
[00:45:15] game is also important so you could
[00:45:16] argue iner if you don't have one like
[00:45:18] inor is pretty
[00:45:24] good relax he's actually very good I
[00:45:27] don't want to like make him seem bad he

[00:46:29] defense sh oh also technically
[00:46:32] technically you can use Black Swan in
[00:46:34] any team as a budget Pila to use your
[00:46:37] skill shred defense and then do nothing
[00:46:39] else but that's usually not the well
[00:46:42] with Dr ratio You could argue it but
[00:46:44] outside of that never last time to say

[00:50:44] return you fight is set savor it for
[00:50:50] me I don't have Modern DPS okay

[00:51:00] just just get one battle is unavoidable
[00:51:02] lend me your strength
[00:51:06] a you'll pay still a full Five Star Team
[00:51:09] cluess what do you want will
[00:51:13] take dude dude dude dude dude dude you
[00:51:16] get dude you can play [ __ ] well QQ
[00:51:18] kind of wants Idol on this game okay I'm
[00:51:20] not going to lie oh yeah you have Dr
[00:51:22] ratio true actually I forgot about yeah
[00:51:24] just play Dr ratio you're fine this game
[00:51:27] actually wants you to have a premium DPS
[00:51:29] like genin wants premium supports here
[00:51:31] you want a premium DPS you want supports
[00:51:32] too but thank
[00:51:41] you lend me your
[00:51:44] strength Memories ofe the wat lies an
[00:51:48] endless AB andless Abyss that parad may
[00:51:52] be savor it for
[00:51:54] me no small premum supports yes however
[00:51:57] here's my argument okay I think if you
[00:51:59] don't have a good healer you are [ __ ]
[00:52:01] in the ass if you have to play like like
[00:52:03] Lynx is okay genuinely but like if
[00:52:05] you're running Lynx on one team and
[00:52:06] Natasha on the other it's like so much
[00:52:08] worse it's a lot harder but
[00:52:11] like support wise yes Ron is [ __ ]
[00:52:14] broken yes Bron's who is a standard you
[00:52:16] might get her like just by playing the
[00:52:18] like you know by pulling and losing
[00:52:21] um so there's that but I feel like at
[00:52:24] the fourar harmonies there's a lot that
[00:52:26] are really good even to H like P's
[00:52:27] broken Ting Yun is sometimes broken like
[00:52:30] depends on who you play but she's good
[00:52:32] AA could be really good uh even [ __ ]
[00:52:35] uh what's her name Han could be
[00:52:38] good so I think I think in terms of like
[00:52:41] supports there's a lot of decent ones
[00:52:43] even though Ron May is [ __ ]
[00:52:47] broken but it depends who you play right
[00:52:50] like if you're playing Emer or like
[00:52:51] Argent or or whatever Ting Yun is like
[00:52:54] really good but if you're playing
[00:52:55] playing like blade like you don't want
[00:52:56] to [ __ ] put U there really and if
[00:52:58] you're playing like even like let's say
[00:53:00] you're playing this team not this one
[00:53:01] but Kafka Black Swan like Ting Yun what
[00:53:04] the what is she going to do she going to
[00:53:04] buff one of your
[00:53:08] characters to you savor it for
[00:53:20] meing you chose The Wrong
[00:53:24] Enemy
[00:53:26] unnecessary is she a better option than
[00:53:28] bronny for blade do you mean okay bronny
[00:53:31] like LeBron James or like BR or like
[00:53:34] silverwolf who's technically
[00:53:38] BR lend me your strength blade Bron is
[00:53:42] silver
[00:53:47] wolf I see uh
[00:53:54] yes
[00:53:57] I would say
[00:53:58] so what's black Swan's purpose here
[00:54:00] nothing this is just a three-man team I
[00:54:01] just put her there to look cool but she
[00:54:03] she has defense tread we're just cuz her
[00:54:04] talents aren't high so we can't really
[00:54:06] like showcase her yet so we're just uh
[00:54:08] we're leveling the talent mats like
[00:54:10] we're getting the talent mats and then
[00:54:11] we'll level her well she's already level
[00:54:13] 80 but and built I just don't have
[00:54:15] traces
[00:54:17] yet to guard defend them the fight is
[00:54:23] set nice
[00:54:27] why your blade hits so hard finally all
[00:54:30] you [ __ ] oh your Blade's so bad
[00:54:32] oh oh no speed no thank you first time
[00:54:35] chatter thank you I should VIP you for
[00:54:37] that I should VIP you for that receive
[00:54:44] Divinity illing
[00:54:49] man fre play replacement for Ron May
[00:54:52] unironically paila the answer is always
[00:54:53] paila or ASA sometimes like in dog teams
[00:54:57] ASA actually CED really
[00:54:59] high in like team DPS cuz ASA gives you
[00:55:02] like speed and attack to all your
[00:55:04] characters so if you're running two DPSS
[00:55:05] it's pretty
[00:55:08] valuable to guard defense
[00:55:17] them
[00:55:23] repent the Dead return Kim there's a
[00:55:26] prime appreciate
[00:55:29] it failed to send you failed to send
[00:55:34] you too little this battle is UN yeah I
[00:55:38] was doing memory of chaos earlier and um
[00:55:41] either 12 or 11 I can't remember and uh
[00:55:43] literally like I was running like the
[00:55:45] most dog [ __ ] team and I was getting
[00:55:46] [ __ ] and then blade just like passive
[00:55:48] onot everything then passive one shot
[00:55:50] everything and then I just
[00:55:53] won I shed
[00:55:57] that paradise savor it for
[00:56:06] me you'll pay for
[00:56:10] this should do HSR guides like on genin
[00:56:13] hey well luckily for you we're doing one
[00:56:15] for Black Swan I don't know how many I'm
[00:56:17] going to do cuz I feel like it's
[00:56:18] unsustainable to have to make like I
[00:56:20] feel like I don't have enough time in my
[00:56:22] life to do all the guides for all the
[00:56:24] characters I want to which is why I
[00:56:26] focus on genin but I will be doing Black
[00:56:27] Swan so and ironically black Swan's
[00:56:30] probably like the most like your streng
[00:56:33] nuanced character we got in a while but
[00:56:36] uh well not really just go hit raid and
[00:56:37] then you're good like it's not hard to
[00:56:39] build her but like the like I don't know
[00:56:41] her kid's a [ __ ] Yu-Gi-Oh card trap
[00:56:43] card
[00:56:44] essay and like every stat every stat can
[00:56:47] be viable on
[00:56:50] her except crit don't go
[00:56:53] crit okay we should have enough
[00:57:05] we're going to spam level her tra her
[00:57:07] talent and then we'll think about the
[00:57:08] rest
[00:57:11] after chat can I do this would you be
[00:57:14] mad at me [ __ ] it I don't care I don't

[00:58:12] her now actually okay let's let me use
[00:58:14] her with Kafka I don't think we need to
[00:58:15] use blade anymore she's probably

[01:06:03] wind even claraa yes if you're playing a
[01:06:06] character that doesn't need speed boost
[01:06:07] then you shouldn't play that character
[01:06:09] that is my take sely benched claraa

[01:07:19] be 30 actually no it's not oh it is 30
[01:07:22] but only for her which is a 10 to 15%
[01:07:24] team DPS increase which is what I said
[01:07:26] but yeah 30% damage for her 10 15 for
[01:07:28] your team but I don't
[01:07:30] recommend I don't recommend ly cone over

[01:08:48] have enough EHR off your sub stats okay
[01:08:49] if you have enough hit rate on your sub
[01:08:51] stats and don't need hit rate on your
[01:08:52] lyone then you are literally the Thanos
[01:08:54] of Black Swan and you shouldn't even be
[01:08:55] in my I should be in your stream you
[01:08:57] shouldn't be asking me questions I
[01:08:59] should be asking you questions but if
[01:09:00] that's the case then you can go for any
[01:09:02] of the damage dealing the hity ones CF
[01:09:04] likeon is probably was definitely the
[01:09:05] best uh well her signature still works
[01:09:07] but you wouldn't want like extra hit

[01:20:33] train pom pom knows how to keep people
[01:20:36] on the edge of their

[01:20:43] pass something important came up

[01:20:55] probably going to do I just want to get
[01:20:57] to penin so I have the new area we're
[01:20:59] going to go then we're going to do new
[01:21:01] pure fiction memory of chaos and maybe
[01:21:05] swarm I think is located in as usually
[01:21:10] this wouldn't be a huge problem sure Las
[01:21:12] Vegas I know Pon is a colony belonging
[01:21:15] to the harmony family okay got it when
[01:21:18] in Rome as they say don't worry
[01:21:21] conductor r
[01:21:23] anyway third I turn St up after could I
[01:21:27] hope that while you're all on
[01:21:30] vacation what nameless allow me to
[01:21:33] explain sure thank youo just like most
[01:21:35] of the worlds that the express calls at
[01:21:37] penone is one of the stops along the
[01:21:39] silver tracks several Millennia ago it
[01:21:42] was an IPC Frontier prison and it was
[01:21:45] the trailblaze that connected it to
[01:21:47] thousands of stars during that time the
[01:21:50] astral Express once visited pentacon
[01:21:52] okay
[01:21:53] as with all meetings they inevitably
[01:21:55] lead to goodbyes as the Express's logs
[01:21:58] indicate it seems some passengers
[01:22:00] decided to
[01:22:02] call
[01:22:03] home is that a rare happening don't
[01:22:05] worry just think of it as returning to
[01:22:07] your hometown following the Express's
[01:22:10] departure the Stellar Rons cut off
[01:22:12] contact to Myriad worlds and penton's
[01:22:15] ownership switched hands several times
[01:22:17] why did these nameless choose to stay
[01:22:19] here how did the course of their
[01:22:21] subsequent lives going to happen first
[01:22:23] in the story no spoilers what do you
[01:22:25] think is going to happen first will we
[01:22:27] get himo or will she die hopefully she
[01:22:30] stay listen hopefully my next PLL we get
[01:22:33] heo and she stays alive that's best case
[01:22:37] scenario left the stars behind them
[01:22:39] their trailblaze would not be over
[01:22:41] that's also what the conductor thinks
[01:22:43] isn't
[01:22:44] it according to the passenger list the
[01:22:47] three people who got off were tyin leg
[01:22:49] work and Rosalina the Express's guard
[01:22:52] mechanic and surveyor respectively no
[01:22:55] one dies details are available yeah no
[01:22:57] no one dies in the story no that would
[01:22:59] never happen
[01:23:00] occations and they don't even sound like
[01:23:03] their real names either this will be
[01:23:06] like looking for a needle and a hay
[01:23:08] stack we'll just leave it to the stars
[01:23:11] of Fate considering the nameless is
[01:23:15] diversity perhaps we'll conclude
[01:23:17] navigation meeting on this point there's
[01:23:20] a bit of time left before we jump in the
[01:23:21] meantime
[01:23:23] might be a good idea to double check
[01:23:24] your bags sounds good an announc before

[01:32:11] Dreamscape where we stood close yet
[01:32:14] forever Out Of
[01:32:17] Reach may I ask you a few more questions
[01:32:20] I tend to forget things which is why
[01:32:24] rather than memories she a chain on her
[01:32:27] arm my emotions to capture what I
[01:32:29] normally wouldn't
[01:32:30] otherwise the answer is
[01:32:33] inconsequential your spontaneous
[01:32:35] reaction is what
[01:32:40] matters for instance when you awaken in
[01:32:43] your room your lips speak several names
[01:32:46] are they your
[01:32:48] companions family enemies
[01:32:52] you seem to have forged unbreakable
[01:32:55] bonds with many people and many
[01:32:58] incidents might I ask if you fear losing
[01:33:02] these bonds yo yo why are you talking in
[01:33:07] red uh
[01:33:11] I if it would mean losing them I
[01:33:16] would I'm saying that to rer up I'm like
[01:33:18] yeah I would never lose you baby girl
[01:33:21] then
[01:33:22] if there was a vast Dreamscape so
[01:33:25] lifelike it's indistinguishable from
[01:33:27] reality there no one faces life's
[01:33:31] separations or deaths [ __ ] everyone
[01:33:33] attains their deserved happiness and

[01:34:24] vows sealed and those left
[01:34:27] hanging all will inevitably March
[01:34:30] towards a predetermined
[01:34:32] ending if you had grasped the Journey's
[01:34:36] finale right from its
[01:34:38] Inception I would
[01:34:40] ask would you still embark on this
[01:34:42] journey wait wait wait let me reread
[01:34:44] that imagine if the spendid dream F fall
[01:34:48] apart all fall apart friends friendly

[01:52:33] to participate in our grand
[01:52:37] celebration that's why we're here you
[01:52:40] recall correctly but there was more to
[01:52:43] this
[01:52:44] invite wait really how do you know it
[01:52:46] says that what the
[01:52:48] [ __ ] in the realm of dreams find the
[01:52:51] legacy of the watch maker father of
[01:52:54] pentacon and thus the answer to the
[01:52:57] question why does life
[01:53:00] Slumber I don't remember that part of
[01:53:03] the invite this is the part that
[01:53:05] intrigues me the invite sent by the
[01:53:08] family was nothing more than a music box
[01:53:11] that when wound would play an
[01:53:13] accompanying tune but the box that was
[01:53:16] sent to us was
[01:53:18] slightly
[01:53:20] unusual the music I recorded these
[01:53:23] dissonant notes and they were a perfect
[01:53:26] match with the gravity wave frequency
[01:53:29] when the Express made its warp jump also
[01:53:33] the express engine spatial curvature
[01:53:35] there's donut there that was good give
[01:53:37] me
[01:53:38] one a distress call method regularly
[01:53:41] used by the
[01:53:43] nameless I can't be
[01:53:46] certain it may be a masked Fool's trap
[01:53:50] from the execution itself the Riddlers
[01:53:53] or Inquisition Spirits could have done
[01:53:55] the
[01:53:57] rers when did you discover this when we
[01:54:00] were handling that La Fu stellon matter
[01:54:03] I told pom pom about it first
[01:54:06] thing it's no wonder that IPC Ambassador
[01:54:09] also mentioned this watch maker the
[01:54:11] invite he received must also have
[01:54:14] contained a hidden message and it seems
[01:54:16] like he decoded
[01:54:18] it there's something else on my mind
[01:54:21] when the invite was brought up that
[01:54:23] family leader mentioned being one of the
[01:54:26] actual administrators of pentacon and
[01:54:29] that it was their duty to relieve us of
[01:54:31] any problems in hindsight there was more
[01:54:35] to that statement he also had Miss Robin
[01:54:38] with him I'm no singer but her voice
[01:54:41] sounded a little strange no all [ __ ]
[01:54:45] talk her voice to the stage if their
[01:54:47] voice wasn't in she's trying are you
[01:54:50] saying you suspect that the family did
[01:54:53] not send the invite and is hiding
[01:54:56] something from
[01:54:57] us she's just not that good at singing
[01:55:00] man it's fine the fact that the family
[01:55:02] sent out invites to the other factions
[01:55:05] is already unusual and your Discovery
[01:55:08] confirms that there could be a third
[01:55:10] party
[01:55:12] involved I take back what I said this
[01:55:15] event is becoming more interesting with
[01:55:18] each passing second
[01:55:20] why didn't you tell the others we
[01:55:22] shouldn't interfere if this is just an
[01:55:24] internal Affair of penacon or the
[01:55:28] family I'm actually not going to say
[01:55:30] anything but you said so yourself this
[01:55:33] could concern the
[01:55:35] trailblaze well I did which is
[01:55:40] why hey guys before we set off I told
[01:55:43] March 7th and Don Hong about
[01:55:46] this so I was the only one kept in the
[01:55:50] dark
[01:55:50] [Music]
[01:55:52] then ain't no biggie when Galactic
[01:55:56] baseballer is in the house okay that's
[01:55:59] literally a war crime if you click this
[01:56:01] option your account should get deleted
[01:56:03] by the way it should just explode you
[01:56:06] restart bad ending situation is getting
[01:56:11] complicated who sent the
[01:56:13] invite what is the purpose of gathering
[01:56:16] all of the factions into Penton and why
[01:56:20] does the family choose to remain silent
[01:56:22] about their knowledge of
[01:56:24] this there are too many unanswered
[01:56:27] questions we must use the oh there's too
[01:56:30] many unanswered
[01:56:32] questions right now let's just focus on
[01:56:35] the conductor's request we'll collect
[01:56:38] Intel while enjoying this wonderful
[01:56:41] vacation penone is after all a famed
[01:56:44] Resort of the cosmos sounds good sounds
[01:56:48] good stay alive F please and we'll do it
[01:56:50] return to your room and prepare to enter
[01:56:51] the dream we should probably enter the
[01:56:54] okay we should probably enter the dream
[01:56:56] enter wait did
[01:56:59] anything I mean we don't need to we
[01:57:02] could technically just go pure fiction
[01:57:04] right
[01:57:04] now and memory of chaos but I should
[01:57:08] probably talk to the
[01:57:10] rest a
[01:57:12] odd that why is my room door open yo
[01:57:16] who's in my
[01:57:18] room bro I'm telling you I'm telling you

[01:57:35] room calm down I'm just here to soak in
[01:57:38] the there VI this may be your room now
[01:57:43] but half a system hour ago it was still
[01:57:47] mine wait why is the door closed a lucky
[01:57:50] block number a lucky floor a lucky room
[01:57:53] number you have no idea how much I went
[01:57:58] through to book this precious
[01:58:00] space and now I've given it to

[01:58:22] blue land of dreams how many across the
[01:58:25] Stars would their just to acquire an
[01:58:28] admission ticket into the
[01:58:34] ree you think about the type of people
[01:58:36] who can even afford to stay here if it
[01:58:40] wasn't for my brilliant plan you think
[01:58:42] the family would offend those big wigs
[01:58:45] just to saate the poultry whims of an
[01:58:47] unsought guest such as yourself myself
[01:58:50] yo yo yo so sit down and let's have a
[01:58:53] chat why are you talking to me like that

[01:58:58] much
[01:59:06] right cut to the sh watch your drink
[01:59:10] true I like that I don't trust him
[01:59:14] simply put my friend I need your help
[01:59:17] you may or may not know this but penacon
[01:59:20] is far murkier than it
[01:59:22] seems the family's eyes are everywhere
[01:59:26] but you get the
[01:59:27] drift my goal is simple help the IPC
[01:59:32] retrieve some things that belong to them
[01:59:35] in the first
[01:59:36] place if you agree when this is done you
[01:59:40] will stand to reap great rewards
[01:59:46] as it's clear you're not just one of the
[01:59:49] croud you possess a distinct quality so
[01:59:54] magnetic that it could sway the outcome
[01:59:56] of any
[01:59:57] game that power you really don't wish to
[02:00:01] use it
[02:00:04] or you don't want to be rid of
[02:00:08] it why not use it to etch Your Name
[02:00:11] Across The
[02:00:12] Stars the power that men both fear and
[02:00:16] desire is right in the palms of your
[02:00:18] hand
[02:00:20] hands Miss ston have I hit the nail on
[02:00:24] the head yo how I don't know I don't
[02:00:28] know what you're talking
[02:00:31] about I'm warning you you need to leave

[02:00:54] you want to of course you can convert

[02:01:06] said use me in
[02:01:07] turn I don't do deals where I'm on the

[02:01:18] down
[02:01:22] uh I don't think the decision matters
[02:01:27] but I already said there's no rush to

[02:05:36] conviction for good and on that man's
[02:05:39] face I see such a similar expression

[02:05:44] little hot you have to admit right use a
[02:05:46] blade must use it to cut eventually
[02:05:49] and when a gambler has nothing to lose
[02:05:51] on the table he will surely go for
[02:05:53] broken bet it all on a final
[02:05:57] hand I thought you should know all this

[02:09:36] the atini peacock boasts one of the
[02:09:38] universe's more jarring songs and your
[02:09:42] choice of attire is somewhat peacock
[02:09:45] esque

[02:09:50] a Feather or two the family's been
[02:09:52] rumaging through your things haven't
[02:09:56] they Yeah by that gray suited fellow all

[02:10:23] [ __ ] Joker this guy's actually crazy
[02:10:26] this actually venturine Stone you're
[02:10:28] nothing more than a doomed seian thraw
[02:10:31] sentenced to die by the IPC or is that
[02:10:34] serial number on your neck a cherished
[02:10:36] momento from the Amber
[02:10:40] Lord sent us to die by the
[02:10:43] IPC you're funny I'll give you that it
[02:10:47] appears our friend has done his
[02:10:50] homework it's my
[02:10:53] job how would a gambler rest pentacon
[02:10:57] back from the IPC
[02:10:59] otherwise don't worry doctor I have my
[02:11:02] ways the family fears interference from
[02:11:05] the IPC hence their constant
[02:11:10] intervention more to play Devil's
[02:11:12] Advocate
[02:11:14] perhaps might have always been a ruse
[02:11:16] under the guise of the heart Harmony if
[02:11:19] you ask me that invite is nothing but a
[02:11:21] self- planted
[02:11:23] diversion a red hering yeah fair
[02:11:28] or maybe they're thinking of pulling off
[02:11:31] something big during the Charmy festival
[02:11:35] or someone else made the invite and they
[02:11:38] acques to elevating the magnitude of the
[02:11:41] plan well regardless be it the family or
[02:11:45] the watchmaker's Legacy as long as
[02:11:48] they're all useful to
[02:11:50] me get to the point true stop
[02:11:56] yapping well no need to expand on that
[02:11:59] now it's not yet time to reveal my trump
[02:12:05] card damned Gambler any true
[02:12:09] collaboration demands trust did that
[02:12:12] notion somehow Escape your seian
[02:12:15] upbringing then do you trust trust me yo
[02:12:20] that depends on you so you don't trust
[02:12:23] me
[02:12:24] either now that was easy wasn't it also
[02:12:28] I didn't go to school and my parents
[02:12:30] didn't teach me any of that a
[02:12:34] pity they left before they could impart
[02:12:36] any life
[02:12:38] lessons I did not mean to
[02:12:42] offend none taken but they did teach me
[02:12:46] that friends are weapons of the aent
[02:12:49] even under the watchful eye of the
[02:12:51] harmony our friends performances have
[02:12:54] far exceeded my
[02:12:56] expectations let's see the garden of
[02:12:59] recollection and the astral Express have
[02:13:01] already made contact the annihilation
[02:13:04] gang I can't really count on them the
[02:13:08] Knights of beauty haven't given their
[02:13:10] answer and as for the bunch at the
[02:13:13] tavern speaking of which I ran into a
[02:13:16] woman just now who introduced herself as

[02:23:08] of the prey I am like turbo copium right
[02:23:12] now we have 114 effect hit rate though
[02:23:14] that's actually enough it's actually
[02:23:16] enough
[02:23:18] so it's
[02:23:35] fine just use tears I did look I ow I
[02:23:40] got a headache from yelling I literally
[02:23:41] only have [ __ ] 45 left nameless
[02:23:46] honor
[02:23:48] wait are they in the shop yet wait what
[02:23:50] if they like got added to the shop but
[02:23:52] it probably would be next month
[02:23:58] oh not a whale by the way they're just
[02:24:00] there why did no one tell
[02:24:03] me why did no one tell
[02:24:08] me it's not whale I had to pull for the
[02:24:16] character
[02:24:22] uh um there's really nothing more
[02:24:24] important than leveling the talent but I
[02:24:26] don't want to spend everything for one
[02:24:28] level even though it's probably
[02:24:30] technically optimal
[02:24:45] um
[02:24:50] okay don't laugh wait one sec I I got a
[02:24:52] bunch of the green
[02:25:03] ones okay
[02:25:05] 988 five out of six although getting
[02:25:08] it's only a 3% base we'll be fine we
[02:25:11] have enough hit rate well we don't it's
[02:25:13] fine wind damage is definitely worth
[02:25:15] getting
[02:25:22] all right we're good we're good we're
[02:25:23] actually cracked we're actually cracked
[02:25:25] actually cracked actually cracked
[02:25:27] actually
[02:25:29] cracked CFA
[02:25:32] geared Black Swan geared Ron May geared
[02:25:36] ho ho geared why is this plus 12 it
[02:25:40] doesn't
[02:25:42] [Music]
[02:25:45] matter
[02:25:47] [Music]
[02:25:50] new pure fiction yes that's what I want
[02:25:51] to do
[02:25:57] primarily uh
[02:25:59] chat give me about 30 seconds to click
[02:26:03] on all of her
[02:26:06] traces actually I could do it later just
[02:26:09] for um editing purposes but I'll do it
[02:26:11] later I'll do it later stop
[02:26:15] counting this is the I was
[02:26:17] playing this is the team wait wait wait
[02:26:20] wait for those of you who missed it this
[02:26:22] is the team where I cleared on Auto
[02:26:24] Battle like Mary Kos 12 right okay Auto
[02:26:27] Battle okay okay but let me show you let
[02:26:30] me show you for those of you who missed
[02:26:42] it our Luca wasn't geared okay Luc is he
[02:26:47] was not geared it was just for fun I
[02:26:48] just wanted to test
[02:26:50] okay okay I'm glad we're on the same
[02:26:54] page but I was looking at this and none
[02:26:56] of these floors of memory of chaos look
[02:26:58] really good for Black Swan cuz here
[02:27:01] there's no lightning or okay I'm
[02:27:02] covering it there's no lightning or
[02:27:04] electric weak um um lightning or wind
[02:27:06] weakness so it's like kind of cringe and
[02:27:09] then Kafka like you don't really want to
[02:27:11] like you can I guess
[02:27:14] but this also has lightning res like I
[02:27:17] feel like neither of these are very good
[02:27:19] to Showcase this team so there's a
[02:27:21] chance I make the characters look worse
[02:27:23] than they are there I could also do the
[02:27:25] six here I know six is not this is easy
[02:27:28] I did it on okay I did it on another
[02:27:30] server but it's easy I just haven't done
[02:27:32] it here I just don't feel like it but
[02:27:33] yeah wind res first half too yeah
[02:27:35] exactly wind res here and then [ __ ]
[02:27:37] lightning res and Lightning by the way
[02:27:39] and then here it's [ __ ] lightning so
[02:27:41] I don't
[02:27:42] know uh I might do memory like I might
[02:27:45] still do it just to say that I did it it
[02:27:47] um cuz I'm sure we can like I'm sure we
[02:27:49] can still
[02:27:50] clear
[02:27:53] um do you want to enter the I mean we
[02:27:57] can will I get [ __ ] by
[02:28:10] Kafka like realistically do
[02:28:13] jinglu BR you
[02:28:18] um paila
[02:28:22] probably and then like fan and then
[02:28:27] second half we
[02:28:28] do Kafka Black
[02:28:32] Swan Ron May
[02:28:35] and probably wo however I value Lu's
[02:28:40] like zero skill point Clans covering the
[02:28:42] teams oh [ __ ] why am I
[02:28:44] here like I I think W is the optimal
[02:28:47] character in this team but I think
[02:28:48] against cfco we want the cleanse like I
[02:28:50] know hoo can cleanse but uh I don't know
[02:28:53] I feel like we're going to I feel like
[02:28:55] the passive is going to help a lot from
[02:28:56] LOA and he's imaginary which could help
[02:28:58] break a little so I think loa's I mean h
[02:29:01] could also break
[02:29:03] but I mean maybe huo is still better
[02:29:06] actually I just think we might need more
[02:29:07] skill points that's why cuz I feel like
[02:29:09] loa's um like I feel like I don't want
[02:29:12] to use Gill as much in that against
[02:29:15] Kafka
[02:29:25] dude sorry I like laa sorry I like him I
[02:29:30] like
[02:29:35] him oh also if you guys want to yeah uh
[02:29:38] if you guys want to know something funny
[02:29:39] about black Swan's alt it has a energy
[02:29:41] cost let me click on max energy to make
[02:29:43] sure I'm not wrong of
[02:29:44] 120 and this means that typically if you
[02:29:48] use your skill four times in a row you
[02:29:51] will get it
[02:29:52] back your ultimate also has
[02:29:56] um it afflicts Epiphany for two turns
[02:29:59] now it's not really a two turn up time
[02:30:01] like technically but it's based on the
[02:30:03] enemy's turn sometimes the enemy will
[02:30:05] move [ __ ] twice in a row well not
[02:30:07] really but like depends on your speed
[02:30:08] but uh yeah
[02:30:11] and however if you're well okay also you
[02:30:14] often times want to do at least one
[02:30:15] basic attack which means you wouldn't
[02:30:17] even be able to for turn alt but W gives
[02:30:19] you
[02:30:21] energy why her eyes paus so she kind of
[02:30:24] makes it uh
[02:30:27] better I think we're going to lose
[02:30:29] unironically I don't know if my CFA is
[02:30:31] strong enough she has 3600 attack 136
[02:30:34] speed which I I could probably get a bit
[02:30:37] more speed this flower sucks my hands
[02:30:40] are good my body's okay it has hit rate
[02:30:43] which I kind of want like a little bit
[02:30:45] boots kind of suck B balls ball is good
[02:30:48] and rope is four speed cuz I don't have
[02:30:49] anything else is way too low it's fine
[02:30:52] like it is low but like what do you want
[02:30:54] me to do like dude SP dude I don't have
[02:30:57] a good
[02:30:58] rope this is what it
[02:31:01] is I mean I could level this but this
[02:31:03] has no attack like I don't dude I swear
[02:31:06] to God I have farmed this this Cavern
[02:31:08] for like actually since it came out like
[02:31:11] actually at least a month of just
[02:31:12] constant
[02:31:13] farming but it's it's hard cuz like I'll
[02:31:16] get a piece of like speed and attack and
[02:31:18] then it rolls dog [ __ ] and I have to
[02:31:20] throw
[02:31:21] it and like this one is better but it's
[02:31:23] on uh BL
[02:31:29] Swan but like I have my body doesn't
[02:31:31] have uh yeah this another thing
[02:31:35] look look if I filter by attack percent
[02:31:38] there's like no speed see no speed no
[02:31:40] speed no speed no speed no speed no
[02:31:43] speed so like it's just unfortunate same
[02:31:46] with um boots is is yeah boots is kind
[02:31:50] of
[02:31:51] hard and then ball I only have 11 attack
[02:31:53] on it that's literally
[02:31:54] it that's what it
[02:31:57] is I could go offset
[02:32:00] planners realistically offset planners
[02:32:03] might be the play now that I think about
[02:32:04] it I could do like lightning wait what
[02:32:07] Lightnings do I
[02:32:10] have no I don't even have any with speed
[02:32:12] maybe attack ball H I don't want to do
[02:32:15] that
[02:32:20] yeah anyways it is what it is it is what
[02:32:24] it is don't talk to
[02:32:33] me I mean we have speed Buffs on our
[02:32:36] team to be fair like we have
[02:32:39] uh we have a bit of speed buff a little
[02:32:42] bit I think Ron May no not Ron May yeah
[02:32:45] that's it anyways we should be
[02:32:54] fine yeah I think it we'll be
[02:32:59] fine
[02:33:02] although [ __ ]
[02:33:06] it for you

[02:34:41] the way I assume we're going to lose but
[02:34:43] we're still going to try okay it's not
[02:34:46] not a great team for uh scenario for
[02:34:48] Black Swan but it is what it is

[02:47:27] there's no way I have to just not heal
[02:47:29] on hoo and hope I'm
[02:47:31] fine we might actually be fine this is
[02:47:33] the last cycle anyway so we're just
[02:47:34] going to go all in yeah we're just going
[02:47:35] to go all in all right [ __ ] you
[02:47:38] Kafka
[02:47:43] e
[02:47:46] wow I got no energy from that to
[02:47:51] know I mean honestly if our first half
[02:47:53] cleared faster we we could have gotten
[02:47:54] it so it's
[02:48:00] fine one
[02:48:02] two yeah we have to skill yeah we have
[02:48:10] to oh wait a second wait value I suppose
[02:48:14] oh I can't wait who oh it's too late
[02:48:17] [ __ ] call it's cuz I'm S4 I have the
[02:48:21] [ __ ] S4 [ __ ] cone if this was S5 I
[02:48:24] would aled if this was S5 I would aled I
[02:48:27] don't have an S5 it's
[02:48:34] S4 wait Arana kills Arana actually kills
[02:48:37] Arana actually Aron
[02:48:40] kills un crush them all every pedal in
[02:48:43] oh we win we win we win we actually win
[02:48:45] use Cog
[02:48:47] no good time to say by we win we
[02:48:51] actually win it's over it's actually
[02:48:52] over I'm not
[02:48:54] joking probably the worst match up for
[02:48:57] that team
[02:48:58] too okay
[02:49:00] easy okay easy I mean to be fair we did
[02:49:03] have an entire other cycle but it was
[02:49:05] more hype believing that I didn't it's
[02:49:08] fine that was just a bad matchup but it
[02:49:10] still worked it was like literally the
[02:49:12] wor yeah who kind of carried I got I
[02:49:14] can't lie
[02:49:16] okay
[02:49:20] cool nice wait I didn't read what the
[02:49:22] blessing does uh let me read this start
[02:49:25] of each cycle apply a random okay random
[02:49:27] debuff that could reduce speed okay
[02:49:35] uh yeah this is so scuffed for bronia
[02:49:38] turn order all right that makes sense
[02:49:40] that explains a lot cuz my [ __ ]
[02:49:43] um
[02:49:45] do you want to enter
[02:49:51] the oh no it's the second part right
[02:49:53] path to immediately take action so that
[02:49:55] would give it to my jinglu and then
[02:49:57] that's on an
[02:49:58] enemy yeah okay that makes sense yeah
[02:50:01] that's why I was like there's no way
[02:50:02] they debuff you yeah okay okay I was
[02:50:05] like dude I was like I swear my Jing Leu
[02:50:08] is faster than my BR 138 135
[02:50:13] anyways um okay
[02:50:15] cool
[02:50:17] cool oh wait can I buy the new lyones
[02:50:20] can I get the sex lone do you want to
[02:50:22] enter do you want to do you want to
[02:50:24] enter the Forgotten Hall do you want
[02:50:27] to wait there's more than I wait I feel
[02:50:30] like I haven't seen all of them yeah I
[02:50:31] know what this does this is actually
[02:50:32] [ __ ] cracked by the way but um it's
[02:50:35] it's good if you have enough hit rate
[02:50:37] but you probably don't have enough hit
[02:50:38] rate for um this character at
[02:50:41] least what is this erudition attack
[02:50:46] two that's not
[02:50:51] bad I don't
[02:50:54] [Music]
[02:50:59] care ooh 25% damage I assume at R S5
[02:51:03] that doubles to 50 okay that uh I would
[02:51:06] use this on blade as a instead of
[02:51:08] [ __ ] the only the [ __ ] wolf walk
[02:51:11] time I want to [ __ ] go [ __ ] sorry
[02:51:14] uh this
[02:51:15] one okay let's just get
[02:51:20] it was this harmony uh C Tye abilities
[02:51:23] basic attack skill or ultimate all
[02:51:25] allies gain
[02:51:27] childishness okay which increases allies
[02:51:30] damage for the same type of ability 12%
[02:51:33] wait that's the [ __ ] same as um what
[02:51:36] is it
[02:51:38] called the the her the AA one the [ __ ]
[02:51:40] is it called planner p p wait I know I
[02:51:44] know what it's
[02:51:45] called wait shut up don't tell me
[02:51:47] chat it's the one with Asa like looking
[02:51:54] up
[02:51:56] planetary planetary
[02:51:58] rendevu yes I got it childish only takes
[02:52:02] effect for the most recent type of
[02:52:03] ability where can be
[02:52:05] stacked after a wear uses whatever same
[02:52:09] D same type 12% damage increase I assume
[02:52:11] it's 24 at S5 ch and that's Harmony
[02:52:16] damn I don't think I'll ever use this in
[02:52:18] my
[02:52:20] life
[02:52:29] [Music]
[02:52:31] but there's probably a use case break
[02:52:33] effect
[02:52:35] B I
[02:52:37] mean eh I don't like that
[02:52:43] one
[02:52:45] wait who the [ __ ] is
[02:52:50] this sely that's what I was thinking but
[02:52:53] I was like it's a preservation lone but
[02:52:59] no this one's actually pretty cool
[02:53:02] flames of far but um from the ones I
[02:53:04] look wait did I read this one yeah that
[02:53:05] one uh from the ones I read wait what
[02:53:07] the [ __ ] does this do I just bought it
[02:53:08] three attack by 12% when the r lands a
[02:53:10] crit gain one stack you can stack up to
[02:53:12] four times each stack gives you crit
[02:53:14] Dage damage by 8% Good Fortune will be
[02:53:17] removed at the end of the wear's
[02:53:20] turn Okay so if you go twice in the same
[02:53:22] turn when the w Wait like if you alt
[02:53:24] after you land a crit you gain one stack
[02:53:26] it Stacks four
[02:53:30] times
[02:53:32] yeah well I already bought
[02:53:35] it this one I'm definitely uh I
[02:53:37] definitely like okay
[02:53:43] anyways read the
[02:53:50] description
[02:53:52] um you don't believe me he provocatively
[02:53:55] looks at the man before him then draws
[02:53:57] out a revolver empties its cylinder and
[02:53:59] leaves a single shot in the
[02:54:01] chamber wait that's literally wait this
[02:54:04] is literally dog and rore seems like
[02:54:06] I'll need to get you up on speed on how
[02:54:09] I do things if our cooperation were to
[02:54:11] remain amicable he pushes the gun into
[02:54:13] his opponent's hand spins the cylinder
[02:54:15] and points the barrel to his own chest
[02:54:17] he pulls the trigger repeatedly and the
[02:54:18] smile on his face Remains the Same after
[02:54:21] three empty clicks life is a grand
[02:54:23] Gamble and always be the final
[02:54:30] Victor okay someone had too much fun
[02:54:33] writing
[02:54:40] that wait let me screenshot
[02:54:43] this
[02:54:48] well what a great and surely not wasted
[02:54:50] half of the year orander six
[02:55:08] months
[02:55:13] chatting
[02:55:16] [Music]
[02:55:21] okay
[02:55:22] sorry I was chatting okay let's go do
[02:55:26] the uh pure fiction yeah I was tweeting
[02:55:28] that I'm glad we actually cleared though
[02:55:30] with that team I was afraid we
[02:55:43] wouldn't
[02:55:53] okay let me play background music
[02:55:55] actually we'll listen to what the game
[02:55:57] sound has
[02:55:59] okay oh also chat can I address
[02:56:02] something really
[02:56:03] fast this is probably my biggest issue
[02:56:05] with people on Twitter right now
[02:56:07] especially one specific person uh I know
[02:56:10] this is going to get clipped a lot but
[02:56:12] whatever who the [ __ ] is this guy he
[02:56:15] replies to all of my tweets with a
[02:56:18] boba
[02:56:20] look what the [ __ ] is
[02:56:26] this who is this
[02:56:31] guy anyways that's all back to the pure
[02:56:36] fiction I didn't do it the when it reset
[02:56:38] I Sav it for stream uh I think you can
[02:56:39] auto start three so we're going to do
[02:56:40] that and we'll do
[02:56:42] four oh apparently
[02:56:46] yeah that's what it is increases
[02:56:48] dot taken by enemy of 50% enemy targets
[02:56:52] that receive do have their damage delal
[02:56:54] reduced and uh after their attack their
[02:56:56] actions
[02:57:01] forward so dot is pretty
[02:57:05] good which helps Black Swan and Kafka so
[02:57:09] we're going to play them
[02:57:13] um there's a [ __ ] a warp
[02:57:17] Trotter these are all weak to wind
[02:57:20] second one they're all weak to
[02:57:23] lightning Argy yes we're going to do
[02:57:25] Argent first half Kafka
[02:57:27] uh Black Swan second half that's the
[02:57:35] play if zff were in chat he would tell
[02:57:38] you to go P key Kafka so that you could
[02:57:40] spam your ultimate oh no not Kafka himo
[02:57:44] wait what does he run oh he runs Hera
[02:57:46] store Leo on Kafka that's the one that
[02:57:48] gives energy pasy humo and then Hera
[02:57:51] store Leo
[02:57:53] Kafka all right Argent is uh
[02:57:55] geared Argent actually good you might be
[02:57:57] like Z why do you have so many [ __ ]

[03:19:41] skill
[03:19:51] good oh it's
[03:19:52] ch does someone know what Arana does
[03:19:55] it's a huge [ __ ] essay basically for
[03:19:57] each dot that you dot it applies stacks
[03:19:59] and then you stack it up and then it
[03:20:00] does damage at the start of the enemy
[03:20:02] turn after all your other dots and then
[03:20:03] it resets to one stack but it stays on
[03:20:05] enemies also you have a chance to apply
[03:20:07] it whenever your allies well you
[03:20:08] guaranteed to apply it whenever your
[03:20:09] allies deal damage and uh technique
[03:20:12] Stacks it more and you stack it from
[03:20:14] your basic you get five Stacks from
[03:20:16] either basing or Skilling inside of your
[03:20:18] alt outside your alt you get like two or
[03:20:19] three
[03:20:21] stacks
[03:20:23] W that's like the fastest way I can

[03:23:14] valuable stand still but like in this

[03:23:36] seven days consecutive stream I really
[03:23:40] shouldn't um like I feel like I'm I feel
[03:23:43] like when I stream too often it's like
[03:23:46] not a good thing please
[03:23:49] die relax thank God okay I don't have to
[03:23:54] C you turn off what do you mean by that

[03:24:07] say
[03:24:08] bye
[03:24:10] boom
[03:24:13] memories are the the main thing is
[03:24:16] honestly it's not the streaming that's
[03:24:17] training it's like if I also have
[03:24:18] YouTube stuff to do so for example like
[03:24:20] it's more beneficial for me like there's
[03:24:22] a lot of stuff I'm Pro procrastinating
[03:24:24] right now um that I should be doing like
[03:24:27] uh like I yeah like just like YouTube
[03:24:30] stuff for the most
[03:24:33] part a burnout not from streaming if
[03:24:36] anything like that's why I took a break
[03:24:38] from like starl guide sometimes like if
[03:24:39] there's too many guides I have to do
[03:24:40] back to back to back it's those are what
[03:24:42] take the most time you all will be swept
[03:24:44] away by the
[03:24:46] W um especially with a character that's
[03:24:50] like kind of complicated like you don't
[03:24:52] want to make a mistake right so it's a
[03:24:53] lot
[03:24:55] of is what it
[03:24:59] is it's not either way the only thing

[04:15:15] dumb I mean you could just level
[04:15:34] it okay but I have a question

[04:15:39] fuen so I could bench her and play
[04:15:41] [ __ ] Lua or hoo surely she's
[04:15:44] literally just this blessing is just
[04:15:45] better than her entire
[04:15:47] character yeah okay yeah okay yeah I'll

[04:16:46] customize my dice I keep one that's good
[04:16:48] for the boss like one that gives speed

[04:35:13] lie oh we get two never mind that was
[04:35:17] worth you die without it no but surely
[04:35:20] we just don't get hit like surely if we
[04:35:22] die we get hit so we keep not getting
[04:35:23] hit by spamming weakness break true
[04:35:27] actually we might run double
[04:35:29] healer I like this I like this
[04:35:33] one right
[04:35:47] the problem is this is temporary energy
[04:35:49] and I might forget to use it that's the
[04:36:04] problem
[04:36:06] I don't think there's anything I want
[04:36:09] right
[04:36:14] yeah it doesn't matter there nothing I
[04:36:19] want I wish I had a dice dice side that
[04:36:22] was good for the boss I should I should
[04:36:23] have done
[04:36:26] that good to not get one shot yeah I I
[04:36:28] know when I do destruction runs I try to
[04:36:30] get a lot of uh like preservation [ __ ]
[04:36:32] too to just never die but um I don't
[04:36:36] know do we just download lcha probably
[04:36:40] right wait so am I doing double healer
[04:36:43] do I even care do I care that
[04:36:47] much surely I could just Ron may it
[04:36:51] right I mean I'm going to be
[04:36:55] honest we might be able to like I feel
[04:36:59] like we don't want two healers cuz we're
[04:37:00] going to get one shot but we want like a
[04:37:02] Healer and a
[04:37:04] shielder
[04:37:06] I feel like we might be able to okay we
[04:37:08] definitely level this no matter what
[04:37:09] this is getting leveled I don't even
[04:37:10] need to think about
[04:37:15] it this is really good too how much
[04:37:18] money do I have
[04:37:20] 49 uh if I do some quick math 49 is one
[04:37:24] gold off like 90 which is really
[04:37:26] annoying which means I might want to do
[04:37:27] two
[04:37:30] blues uh could do up
[04:37:34] golds
[04:37:37] suspicion Stacks will not be reduced
[04:37:38] wait when did they get reduced two
[04:37:39] stacks that's nothing yeah it doesn't
[04:37:41] matter what is
[04:37:50] this that's pretty
[04:37:54] good this is also pretty good actually
[04:37:57] it's only one right wait trigger extra
[04:37:59] dot one
[04:38:01] time is only one I I really care about
[04:38:05] that if it's only
[04:38:08] one dude there's so
[04:38:12] many oh well I know Z Would level the
[04:38:15] energy
[04:38:16] one you bet you bet your ass I'm
[04:38:23] not I know you want me to level it I
[04:38:27] know you
[04:38:31] do okay I'm going to be real with you
[04:38:41] I'm GNA be real with you I know for a
[04:38:46] fact this is broken and this is
[04:38:51] broken the nahil five stars I'm not sure
[04:39:02] about but I think I level these two
[04:39:04] three stars for sure then how much gold
[04:39:06] I have left that's 260 so I could level
[04:39:08] one more only five star upgrade suck do
[04:39:11] they yeah I mean they don't look
[04:39:13] particularly amazing okay I'm going to
[04:39:15] do this I'm going to do this now we can
[04:39:17] level oh probably just two two two uh
[04:39:19] two of these sounds
[04:39:21] better I
[04:39:23] mean oh this is oh my
[04:39:27] God and then I mean I guess we do this
[04:39:30] but I kind of don't want to cuz I'm mad
[04:39:31] about
[04:39:33] it
[04:39:40] ah bro please dude [ __ ] the
[04:39:44] sunrise fine
[04:39:47] fine okay now I need to figure out my
[04:39:52] team I figure out my team
[04:40:03] now I don't have anything that increases
[04:40:06] my damage unfortunate bad dice
[04:40:07] management but it is what it
[04:40:13] is what is this
[04:40:19] uh I'm down to fight this enemy what
[04:40:21] does this do enemies take 30% more
[04:40:23] damage while their weakness broken
[04:40:24] that's good what does this remove
[04:40:26] resonance destruction this enemy
[04:40:29] looks less annoying than the [ __ ]
[04:40:32] sting and it's weak to lightning
[04:40:41] yeah they don't look happy to see us you
[04:40:44] move face cam wait really where should

[04:41:08] be honest surely she doesn't die
[04:41:31] right what's her E1 isn't it like CR
[04:41:35] damage
[04:41:54] yeah like this is the standard team I
[04:41:56] know but I'm debating doing two healers
[04:41:59] but the only problem with two healers is
[04:42:00] what the [ __ ] do they do either I get
[04:42:02] one shot or I don't get one shot I don't
[04:42:03] need extra healing
[04:42:05] if I do need more healing lra gives way
[04:42:06] more than like lra will passively give
[04:42:08] me a lot more than hoo but I don't think
[04:42:10] I need healing I just need to not
[04:42:13] die yeah like I literally don't press my

[05:08:44] that that that that that that
[05:08:47] yeah I did not mean to click Roll by the
[05:08:50] way I promise but I think this is still
[05:08:51] a decent

[05:08:57] into okay # ad yes not # ad uh
[05:09:05] uh that's up to you I find it
[05:09:08] fun I would do this but we're one HP on
[05:09:12] every character and I don't trust
[05:09:23] it that was so much
[05:09:25] worse that was so
[05:09:31] bad
[05:09:34] anyways if you like the gameplay of this
[05:09:36] like the the turnbas combat and you like
[05:09:39] the characters and how they look I think
[05:09:41] you there's a lot of content which is
[05:09:45] nice but if you're not a fan of how it
[05:09:47] plays then I wouldn't recommend it make
[05:09:49] a
[05:09:50] wish
[05:10:01] sound
[05:10:05] honestly we're already one HP anyways
[05:10:07] right [ __ ] it what does this do bring
