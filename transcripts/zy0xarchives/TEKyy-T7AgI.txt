[00:08:42] where where you're [ __ ] I will ban
[00:08:45] everyone if you're lying where where

[00:09:09] good
[00:09:12] yes wait that's so
[00:09:14] good this isn't Shia Banner dude yeah
[00:09:17] but who cares if you're a Shia man with
[00:09:19] a [ __ ] brain you want farzon you want
[00:09:21] Shan Yun so you're pulling here
[00:09:26] anyways I don't know yeah I don't know
[00:09:28] why no's there but they just needed Noel
[00:09:30] to be somewhere they didn't want the
[00:09:32] banner to be too good if Noel wasn't
[00:09:34] there this would be like the best Banner
[00:09:35] of all time for
[00:09:39] Shia I mean unironically Noel's good
[00:09:41] with finina but
[00:09:43] like Cory donated $1 I saw some leaks
[00:09:48] saying xia is still Shir in
[00:09:51] 4.5 he's not short Shia's right there in
[00:09:55] the bottom
[00:09:58] right
[00:10:06] yo dude why is she built like that holy
[00:10:09] [ __ ]
[00:10:12] anyways should we do a banner review
[00:10:14] okay let me turn my actual cam on
[00:10:16] Welcome to the stream we have a lot to
[00:10:17] talk about by the way like actually a
[00:10:19] lot actually a lot actually not even
[00:10:22] like not even like stalling this time
[00:10:24] not even like like like lying this
[00:10:28] time
[00:10:29] oh my God that's a lot of sack weapons
[00:10:31] what the [ __ ] and the racist spear which
[00:10:33] is actually good for sh sorry xenophobic
[00:10:37] spear
[00:10:44] ooh I wait this is actually not bad I
[00:10:54] mean the catalysts are kind
[00:10:57] of like the five Catalyst I'm kind of
[00:11:00] question mark about cuz each of them are
[00:11:01] very Niche like you don't really want to
[00:11:04] use Nita's Catalyst on that many
[00:11:05] characters same with Cloud
[00:11:07] retainers um but the sack weapons are
[00:11:11] really I mean pretty nice
[00:11:19] honestly the lamp on sucros I mean
[00:11:27] true
[00:11:31] okay let's talk about
[00:11:34] this genin uh Diamond this a 30 months
[00:11:37] Lun thanks the tier one hi z x just
[00:11:40] wanted to thank you for your streams
[00:11:43] really cheer me love you take care
[00:11:46] appreciate it chat I'm going to be
[00:11:48] honest sorry my [ __ ] phone wires in
[00:11:50] the way it's tilting me chat I'm going
[00:11:52] to be honest we've made history today
[00:11:55] this is the first time getting a farizon
[00:11:57] as a Shain is isn't [ __ ] tied to
[00:12:00] Scara sorry Scara no disrespect but for
[00:12:03] the first [ __ ] time Shia can actually
[00:12:05] get fars on without getting a c26 Scara
[00:12:09] thank [ __ ] god thank
[00:12:12] God farzon is with Cloud retainer which
[00:12:15] is amazing because Cloud retainer plunge
[00:12:18] Buffs from what we know her weapon Buffs
[00:12:21] plunging very clearly a plunge support
[00:12:23] farzon the best support for Shia
[00:12:27] especially at C6 which means means this
[00:12:29] Banner is very nice gaming is also a new
[00:12:31] character which means you probably want
[00:12:33] him going to pause alerts and
[00:12:38] Noel is
[00:12:40] pretty so I am very happy about this
[00:12:42] Banner extremely happy would I rather
[00:12:45] farzon be with Shia or Shaun I don't
[00:12:48] know ideally both but it is what it is
[00:12:51] if you are a Shia main P here second
[00:12:54] time she was given as an event reward
[00:12:55] that doesn't count it's not a banner
[00:12:57] ratio because the thing with farizon is
[00:13:00] you don't just need one you don't just
[00:13:02] need two you don't even need three you
[00:13:04] need [ __ ] seven you need
[00:13:08] seven the junk cook of
[00:13:13] genin you need seven see dude
[00:13:17] oh I can't wait till you [ __ ]
[00:13:20] dude even with Cloud retainer you still
[00:13:23] want her C6 cuz it's like battery in
[00:13:24] your Cloud Rainer so if you don't have
[00:13:25] first on C6 not only will your sh suffer
[00:13:27] your Cloud will suffer too
[00:13:29] anyways soorus they said nine months uh
[00:13:33] 32 months Jesus n there said 10 s there
[00:13:36] a
[00:13:37] nine so yeah this Banner overall very
[00:13:39] nice if you're a Shia main because
[00:13:41] shenyun and farzon for other characters
[00:13:44] shenyun nice guming looks really good
[00:13:46] probably going to get better with
[00:13:47] constellations but we don't know yet
[00:13:48] he's not out uh so you know stay tuned
[00:13:52] uh but yeah that's cool the other
[00:13:53] character is just Nikita who's broken so
[00:13:56] yeah farzon if you're not a sh player or
[00:13:59] a Scara player you kind of don't want to
[00:14:02] see her there but um yeah pull
[00:14:08] sha so I'm happy about
[00:14:17] that weapon
[00:14:21] manner
[00:14:22] um yeah very sacky very sack Bas
[00:14:27] literally every sack cuz there's no sack
[00:14:29] spear sack bow it's okay nice on daa
[00:14:32] it's okay sack sword also pretty nice
[00:14:35] especially with the refinements can use
[00:14:36] it on a few characters Chi zingro a lot
[00:14:38] of characters it's okay not amazing it's
[00:14:41] okay sack Catalyst sack frags very good
[00:14:45] sa frag is actually really cracked you
[00:14:46] could use on like sugr Nita very very
[00:14:48] good anyone that needs M I like it a lot
[00:14:50] I use it on kokomi as well In Bloom
[00:14:52] teams I like it and then sack great
[00:14:55] sword I think is limited because a lot
[00:14:58] lot of Claymore characters Claymore
[00:15:00] supports kind of suck not all of them
[00:15:02] BET's great but she doesn't really use
[00:15:04] sack but a lot of like like you don't
[00:15:07] want to play like like like you could
[00:15:08] use like Dory saou but like who's
[00:15:10] playing Dory saou maybe you are if you
[00:15:14] are cool but it's it's actually not bad
[00:15:17] on
[00:15:18] Navia to be fair it's not bad on Navia
[00:15:21] and like cave so it's not even it's not
[00:15:25] a bad weapon sa gra is actually not a
[00:15:26] bad weapon it's just there's not that
[00:15:27] many supports that like it's not bad and
[00:15:30] then lithic spear um the xenophobic
[00:15:33] spear so typically it's a pretty decent
[00:15:35] stat stick and Shia can actually use it
[00:15:37] but the problem with sha teams is there
[00:15:39] was never an anemo support there's no
[00:15:41] anemo character other than
[00:15:43] Shia who hails from
[00:15:46] leeway because of this it has been it's
[00:15:49] been difficult to stack it on Shia
[00:15:53] however with Cloud retainer shun the
[00:15:56] weapon's actually better for him and
[00:15:58] it's actually a pretty good pole
[00:16:01] arm so
[00:16:05] yeah uh pretty good for the five stars
[00:16:09] uh you either want them or you don't
[00:16:10] want them it is what it
[00:16:11] is n's weapon is the's Weapon It's a
[00:16:14] Rara upside down not the most flexible
[00:16:16] weapon but if you need em on like a
[00:16:18] character you can use it typically it's
[00:16:19] for Nita though um it's okay a lot of
[00:16:22] stats and then like it's good but it's
[00:16:25] just not like I would mostly just pull
[00:16:27] it for Nita and then the other one Cloud
[00:16:29] retainers fan very pretty also very good
[00:16:34] very good just actually very good
[00:16:37] um you don't need it but I think you
[00:16:40] will like it if you are planning to use
[00:16:42] cloud retainer a lot in a team with a
[00:16:45] plunge DPS example
[00:16:48] shout uh and while you can go thrilling
[00:16:50] Tails stuff like that this weapon has a
[00:16:53] insane base
[00:16:55] attack this is like the same sty line as
[00:16:57] Shan has weapon so I'm going to assume
[00:16:59] she's like
[00:16:59] Shena the stats give you 28% increased
[00:17:03] damage to your plunges very good for any
[00:17:06] plunge attacker
[00:17:08] lament and crucially when you plunge you
[00:17:12] restore 2.5 energy up to once every 7
[00:17:15] Seconds this is a [ __ ] ton of energy
[00:17:17] okay a lot so if your character needs if
[00:17:20] shenu needs a lot of energy this is
[00:17:21] going to help a lot on top of plunging
[00:17:24] on top of Base tack this looks really uh
[00:17:26] honestly really good the the problem is
[00:17:28] there's probably really good
[00:17:29] Alternatives thrilling Tails
[00:17:31] [ __ ] do I want to do EV ranking now
[00:17:34] she's not out not really but if you need
[00:17:37] energy [ __ ] you can go fav you can go
[00:17:39] [ __ ] oath Sor and eye that gives
[00:17:40] attack and energy you can go [ __ ]
[00:17:42] Amber even though the HP sucks and I
[00:17:43] hate that weapon you can go like a lot
[00:17:45] of weapons right stat sticks five stars
[00:17:48] there's a lot you can go but this weapon
[00:17:49] does look really good so yeah how do you
[00:17:51] know skills on attack read the [ __ ]
[00:17:52] weapon Bozo read the [ __ ] weapon Bozo
[00:17:54] this is literally a sheno
[00:17:57] weapon
[00:18:00] they wouldn't release a weapon like this
[00:18:02] if she scaled on [ __ ]
[00:18:06] HP yeah
[00:18:09] also thrilling Tales gives
[00:18:12] attack like Vermillion this gives damage
[00:18:15] percent like MOSI so you get this you
[00:18:18] Vermilion true l
[00:18:20] w
[00:18:24] anyways
[00:18:26] anyways justify Vermillion again
[00:18:38] [Music]
[00:18:57] concerned and I'm going to be honest
[00:19:04] chat I want to be
[00:19:07] honest I love shenyun and I'm very
[00:19:09] excited for her but the fact that now
[00:19:13] Shia Mains can get a C6 Faron by pulling
[00:19:16] hopefully if you're
[00:19:17] lucky is amazing because as we all
[00:19:22] know playing farizon at c0 is like
[00:19:26] trying to play the fiddle but you don't
[00:19:28] know any good fiddles you don't know you
[00:19:31] it's like okay it's like playing farizon
[00:19:33] F0 is like a guitar that isn't tuned and
[00:19:36] like yeah but you don't know how to tune
[00:19:38] it and you don't have a tuner so you're
[00:19:39] like you're trying to like go by ear but
[00:19:41] you're you're kind of not that
[00:19:42] experienced so you're trying to tune it
[00:19:43] like it's not really tuning properly
[00:19:46] it's still going to play music it's
[00:19:48] still better than no instrument if
[00:19:50] you're bored you want a
[00:19:52] Melody but it's not playing the exact
[00:19:55] Melody you want no I wish that note
[00:19:57] sounded different ah I wish I had energy
[00:20:00] I wish I I did
[00:20:02] something that's CZ farza it's doing
[00:20:06] something but C6 perfectly
[00:20:12] tuned I'm going to un uh unmute alerts
[00:20:15] St beef thanks of 50 months gold thanks
[00:20:18] of five Son Of Da of 29 dark SP than of
[00:20:20] 13 friendly who thinks of four months
[00:20:22] appreciate
[00:20:24] it this how you don't doesn't play an
[00:20:26] instrument I've did 60 years of piano
[00:20:28] and like four years of guitar what the
[00:20:30] [ __ ] are you talking
[00:20:35] about if your shit's not tuned you don't
[00:20:37] know how to tune it it's annoying what
[00:20:38] are you going to do you're going to
[00:20:40] download an app that Tunes
[00:20:45] it
[00:20:53] anyways anyways cool Banner very happy
[00:20:56] because of Faraz on but if you're not a
[00:20:58] Shain uh RI Bozo but I mean ging's there
[00:21:01] so that's cool um because both of the
[00:21:04] new characters are on the first half and
[00:21:06] Nita is I actually am like overloaded in
[00:21:08] content I recorded a full Nita guide
[00:21:10] tomorrow hopefully I can start on Chen
[00:21:12] Yun and I have to do ging after he's out
[00:21:14] so expect all those videos and then
[00:21:16] probably duuke uh so yeah a lot of
[00:21:18] content coming apparently there's a
[00:21:21] guming demo we're going to watch
[00:21:24] this going to watch this Academia
[00:21:30] hell who's a good punch attacker other
[00:21:32] than Shia probably ging
[00:21:34] duuke who
[00:21:43] maybe realistically though if she can
[00:21:47] enable you to plunge the characters that
[00:21:49] you would use either Infuse your noral
[00:21:51] attacks or our catalysts realistically I
[00:21:55] don't know like I haven't seen Cals or
[00:21:56] anything like we'll have to see but
[00:21:58] realistically it'll be like duuke maybe
[00:22:02] Hut maybe Ryden I don't know if Ryden
[00:22:04] infus or plunges actually don't know
[00:22:07] then like
[00:22:08] Yi
[00:22:10] rizzly probably not Nita I don't think
[00:22:12] you play in a drro
[00:22:17] team same
[00:22:20] shirt child doesn't child can't even I'm
[00:22:23] pretty sure child can't plunge isn't
[00:22:25] that a thing can't child literally not
[00:22:27] Plunge
[00:22:30] I'm pretty sure I've like I've made
[00:22:32] child for a little bit I'm pretty sure
[00:22:34] you literally
[00:22:35] can't yeah you [ __ ] can't [ __ ]
[00:22:43] idiot anyways ABA K
[00:22:56] Rob okay we have have a lot to talk
[00:22:59] about but let me start with the Wordle
[00:23:01] genal so I don't get
[00:23:03] distracted what yeah child you can't if
[00:23:05] you're in your stance like you literally
[00:23:06] can't yeah same with
[00:23:08] AO you can't ignore Kazo what do you

[00:31:42] that this has been a same shirt it was
[00:31:44] it was the same day I just put the hood
[00:31:45] up one of the main things recently is
[00:31:47] the treatment of the star rail
[00:31:49] game first he made a Tik Tok now he's
[00:31:52] doing thirst trap camera perspective
[00:31:54] second also I'm going to say it dude

[00:32:37] won't see that until next patch so stay
[00:32:40] tuned anyways hope you enjoyed this
[00:32:42] video um I actually think you know I I I
[00:32:46] I I didn't script this at all so I just
[00:32:48] kind of yapped but I think it was done
[00:32:50] pretty well so let me know mut this a
[00:32:52] prime I will okay I will say it this is
[00:32:54] going to be a bad take but I feel like
[00:32:58] people especially in this community have
[00:33:01] been asking for a lot of [ __ ] all the
[00:33:02] time and I think we need to keep doing
[00:33:04] so but I feel like nobody car like a lot
[00:33:06] of people didn't care until starel got
[00:33:08] treated better and now they're like oh
[00:33:10] now we have to it's like yo keep it up
[00:33:12] even like if tomorrow star rail explodes
[00:33:15] and doesn't exist we should still ask
[00:33:17] for stuff it shouldn't be dependent on
[00:33:18] Star rail but I get it it's like
[00:33:25] oh
[00:33:30] bro like this own video if you don't
[00:33:31] like what you make how do you expect
[00:33:32] others to like
[00:33:49] it3 anyways so that's that all that
[00:33:51] shit's
[00:33:53] out
[00:33:55] poggers
[00:34:03] watch the demo stop stalling no I must
[00:34:15] stall I
[00:34:18] must C6 far is on build anything that's
[00:34:21] not true um I like milth to buff your
[00:34:24] team you could also if you don't care
[00:34:26] about milth you go well VV is better if
[00:34:28] you need the swirl if not you could also
[00:34:30] go like emblem no blast but typically
[00:34:33] you go
[00:34:34] milth you can also golden troop yeah
[00:34:36] andess 22
[00:34:43] months I don't know happens when zzz
[00:34:45] comes out okay here's the thing though m
[00:34:48] Michelle 30 months here's the thing if
[00:34:50] they release okay I'm going to say this
[00:34:52] you're going to get mad at me if they
[00:34:53] release a new game and the game play is
[00:34:55] like bad as [ __ ] but they have more
[00:34:57] rewards what the I'm not going to play
[00:34:59] it if they release a game and it sucks
[00:35:01] donkey penis but they give us free [ __ ]
[00:35:04] I'm not going to be like wow that's so
[00:35:05] much better than genin like hopefully we
[00:35:08] get free [ __ ] too like we should but
[00:35:10] that's not going to be the only reason
[00:35:12] for me to play a
[00:35:13] game zzz's combat looks really fun the
[00:35:16] TV system makes me want to jump into a
[00:35:18] TV and take a bath with it but the
[00:35:20] gameplay looks fun so hopefully uh they
[00:35:23] expand on that and minimize the like TV
[00:35:25] menuing
[00:35:41] hopefully but I don't
[00:35:44] um no I I don't know I'm a bit more
[00:35:46] educated about this subject now than I
[00:35:48] was before I think the main argument is
[00:35:51] and should be shouldn't be um shouldn't
[00:35:55] be about exactly how much [ __ ] each game
[00:35:58] gets but it's more so about you should
[00:36:01] feel appreciated as a community and like
[00:36:04] get rewards that show it like I feel
[00:36:06] like it should be like even if it was
[00:36:08] like honest to God even if it was just
[00:36:10] one Dev that came out was like hey we
[00:36:11] hear you here's our plans moving forward
[00:36:13] here's like all the stuff you've been
[00:36:15] asking for it would be infinitely better
[00:36:16] I know it's going to be a whale take but
[00:36:18] I think that's infinitely better than
[00:36:19] just be like oh here are some pulls shut
[00:36:20] up right like it's like if there's just
[00:36:22] one dude I I said this take [ __ ] two
[00:36:24] years ago by the way but nobody cared
[00:36:26] two years ago and last year anyways one
[00:36:28] guy named him Bob or [ __ ] Richard and
[00:36:31] then this guy comes on everyone's like
[00:36:32] oh my God I love you Bob and he just
[00:36:33] like acts like he cares he doesn't even
[00:36:35] have to care they literally he doesn't
[00:36:37] have to give a [ __ ] but he has to
[00:36:38] pretend hey man I care about you okay
[00:36:40] we're goingon to hey we hear you hey we
[00:36:42] hear you and then everyone oh my God I
[00:36:44] love Bob and then it doesn't matter he
[00:36:47] doesn't have to do [ __ ] well ideally he
[00:36:48] does stuff but he literally just that
[00:36:50] Bob comes out hey Bob I'm Bob from the
[00:36:53] the development team we hear you okay
[00:36:55] you wanted de's e to last longer we hear
[00:36:58] you we you wanted uh [ __ ] Co-op to do
[00:37:01] with your friends endgame content
[00:37:03] [ __ ] [ __ ] uh new skin [ __ ] you
[00:37:05] wanted a free selector we hear
[00:37:09] you
[00:37:12] true Bob my
[00:37:17] goat
[00:37:19] anyways that's called road map oh yeah
[00:37:22] road maps are so
[00:37:25] good but anyways that's never going to
[00:37:28] happen doesn't mean we shouldn't ask for
[00:37:30] it though it'd be cool I think I think
[00:37:31] we should
[00:37:36] but [ __ ] into that okay maybe not
[00:37:51] that I
[00:37:53] um yeah I mean in all all honesty which
[00:37:57] is the sad part I don't think I'm the
[00:37:59] Target demographic of genin as someone
[00:38:03] who is very like look I like to think
[00:38:07] I'm good at games you could disagree I
[00:38:10] know a jeffw but I like to think I'm a
[00:38:12] gamer okay shout out gaming I'm a
[00:38:21] gamer but the I can't go a higher floor
[00:38:25] than someone who's playing one-handed on
[00:38:27] their phone I've seen people clear the
[00:38:29] abyss I cleared the abyss with [ __ ]
[00:38:31] no
[00:38:32] mouse
[00:38:36] anyways we got to get more lore in game
[00:38:39] I found it out on a weird website what
[00:38:42] [ __ ] does that
[00:38:44] mean what do you mean one-handed I
[00:38:46] literally made a video on this
[00:38:51] Abyss yeah spiral Abyss but I can't use
[00:38:53] a mouse look
[00:38:58] see no
[00:39:05] mouse new 2.3 Abyss is crazy I'm going
[00:39:09] to give you guys some must know tips
[00:39:11] strategies okay first of all I K was on
[00:39:12] iron Stak what's up guys today I'm going
[00:39:14] to give you guys some must tips
[00:39:15] strategies teams you can
[00:39:17] use are both weak to their respective
[00:39:20] element when you're elect I'm playing
[00:39:22] taser and [ __ ] taser and [ __ ] 2.3
[00:39:24] based he will lose 5% resistance to that
[00:39:27] Electro basically just making you deal
[00:39:29] way way more damage through Electro
[00:39:31] meaning Electro oh my God yes
[00:39:36] sir quick swap like I love this what's
[00:39:41] wrong with nothing but it's often times
[00:39:45] with Kaza you would rather have an
[00:39:47] energy weapon than an em weapon a lot of
[00:39:49] the time unless you have freedom sword
[00:39:51] it's not bad though it's just when you
[00:39:53] use the corresponding element against
[00:39:55] whichever dog you're fighting while yes
[00:39:56] they lose a lot of resistance so it's
[00:39:58] highly suggested you should also know
[00:40:00] that they will start attacking faster
[00:40:02] and also something I should mention with
[00:40:03] these enemies in general is that they do
[00:40:05] have the corrosion effect which yo what
[00:40:07] is ning Wong doing by the way look at
[00:40:09] this look at thise least bugged
[00:40:11] character look at this charge attack
[00:40:13] look at where they go bro what are you
[00:40:15] shooting at effect which will just deal
[00:40:18] damage over time to all of your
[00:40:19] characters which
[00:40:20] is wait what is happening here wait let
[00:40:23] me look at my character list oh my God
[00:40:25] my Ki is only level 70 my IO is only
[00:40:27] level 70 my sing CH is level what the
[00:40:30] [ __ ] is wrong with me move on from Team
[00:40:31] suggestions a few that I wanted to
[00:40:33] mention are a high investment Ula team
[00:40:35] that can one shot a lot of enemies
[00:40:38] at or any team that
[00:40:41] UTI is very strong and can hit all most
[00:40:44] annoying one is since he can Dash away
[00:40:46] from you the way to play around this
[00:40:47] that I found and there might be others
[00:40:49] but the lure that I used revolves going
[00:40:51] to the top left corner of as you see on
[00:40:53] screen right now which will lure The
[00:40:55] magu KES close to each other and then
[00:40:56] when you go fight they will all be there
[00:40:58] this is the method that worked for me to
[00:40:59] prevent the maluki from immediately
[00:41:01] dashing away making the fight a lot
[00:41:03] easier another thing you should know and
[00:41:05] this is the most obvious tip but I want
[00:41:06] to get it out way is that you should try
[00:41:08] to kill all of them at the same time and
[00:41:10] so AOE damage is highly recommended
[00:41:12] running someone like Shang Ling all of
[00:41:15] them simultaneously and try to optimize
[00:41:17] whichever team you're running to where
[00:41:18] you're constantly
[00:41:19] hitting now to give a bit of advice on
[00:41:21] how to I
[00:41:24] see anyways
[00:41:26] I don't know why I watch
[00:41:33] that hey what's up guys welcome to my
[00:41:35] complete Abyss
[00:41:37] guide now we're going to talk about
[00:41:39] Abyss floor 11 now for most of you this
[00:41:41] is probably why you click on the video
[00:41:42] your drama video with
[00:41:44] face voice is cursed comp with you know
[00:41:47] just decent artifacts they don't have to
[00:41:49] be amazing and we're going to be talking
[00:41:50] about that
[00:41:51] NPC I'm not an NPC one is usually the
[00:41:54] easiest uh two is the monolith
[00:41:56] protecting which is AI abuse learning
[00:41:59] the Chad do you guys not remember 112
[00:42:01] look at this [ __ ] talking
[00:42:03] about uh you will notice a lot of
[00:42:05] enemies basically there are two Rock
[00:42:07] Shield hilly TRS that attack the mo two
[00:42:10] of like the
[00:42:11] tors archers one on you one on the
[00:42:14] monolith so uh basically the way the
[00:42:16] archers work is that every time one dies
[00:42:18] another will respawn until there are no
[00:42:19] more of them dude this was so good this
[00:42:21] is actually Peak whatever
[00:42:24] anyways anyway
[00:42:30] anyways
[00:42:33] um dude I saw an article that had my
[00:42:35] tweet in
[00:42:36] it but let's not talk about that uh two
[00:42:40] things first
[00:42:43] thing first
[00:42:49] thing first thing and this is very
[00:42:53] important I have
[00:42:55] noticed
[00:42:56] that for three years my bit
[00:43:01] rate has been [ __ ] because of me so
[00:43:05] you may have noticed that in my guides
[00:43:07] the abyss footage doesn't look as clear
[00:43:09] as it should and on Twitch when I live
[00:43:11] stream on Twitch this happens because
[00:43:13] twitch caps your bit rate which is dumb
[00:43:16] but when I record I record at a really
[00:43:18] high bid rate so my Abyss is clear but I
[00:43:20] noticed that when in my editing software
[00:43:23] garbage software by the way garbage
[00:43:25] program I select 1080p 60 FPS it auto
[00:43:29] set the bid rate to 1
[00:43:32] Mbps
[00:43:34] look I didn't notice this I've been
[00:43:37] uploading and exporting for three years
[00:43:41] at
[00:43:42] one I asked Allan who else who my guides
[00:43:46] I asked editor hey by the way does do my
[00:43:50] exports look different than yours and
[00:43:52] these are the pictures he sent me this
[00:43:54] is his export of the same video and then
[00:43:57] this is mine that I uploaded to
[00:44:00] YouTube dude you can count the [ __ ]
[00:44:05] pixels this this is 3 years of uploading
[00:44:09] by the way this is what I look
[00:44:13] like this isn't a joke like you can
[00:44:16] actually check this is not a joke it
[00:44:18] auto set this to one how the [ __ ] would
[00:44:20] I know I didn't know what bit raid
[00:44:23] was I found out last year but here's the
[00:44:26] thing I set my bid rate on OBS so I
[00:44:29] record like 15K bid rate I stream the
[00:44:33] twitch limit of like seven or
[00:44:35] eight but for some reason when I [ __ ]
[00:44:38] export it set it auto to one uh MBM bits
[00:44:42] which I think it means thousand I don't
[00:44:43] know but it set it to one I looked it up
[00:44:47] for 1080p you need at least
[00:44:51] 12 Z Jeff dm' me
[00:44:54] concerned
[00:45:07] Z Jeff DM me concerned he said surely
[00:45:09] you're making it up
[00:45:11] right I sent him D like you know dm with
[00:45:15] my
[00:45:18] editor he said dot dot dot how are you
[00:45:22] this dumb I'm just impressed
[00:45:43] guys see IDE Edge I said uh said yeah I
[00:45:48] can calate for something I said POG
[00:45:49] almost home finally glad jump scare in
[00:45:51] my eye said LOL I thought you were going
[00:45:53] to me to
[00:46:02] I said 10 likes and I move her
[00:46:07] hand anyways uh welcome to the
[00:46:16] stream wel to the
[00:46:20] stream

[00:46:24] happened

[00:47:09] streamer oh also dude I [ __ ] called
[00:47:12] the editing software cuz these
[00:47:13] [ __ ] are like dude why the [ __ ]
[00:47:15] would you set it at one bid rate by
[00:47:17] default when I do 1080 60 and not say
[00:47:19] anything I think that's by the way I
[00:47:21] think that's [ __ ] stupid like I think
[00:47:22] it's actually so dumb that they should
[00:47:24] be sued I'm not joking [ __ ] the editing
[00:47:26] software it's actual garbage and they
[00:47:27] literally were like oh we're so sorry
[00:47:29] sir we're so sorry I'm like dude okay I
[00:47:31] get it like I'm not mad at you but like
[00:47:33] why is this the thing they said look it
[00:47:35] is what it is we can't fix it but we can
[00:47:37] give you resin if you want so we have

[00:55:54] of all you usually usually would Kaza
[00:55:55] this doesn't matter too much but
[00:55:57] typically in this team what you do with
[00:55:58] Kaza is you benit Al first or you can
[00:56:00] Kazo e but you benit Al so there's a
[00:56:02] pyrro field Electro applied on the enemy
[00:56:04] then you CAO e and Q you swirl Electro
[00:56:06] but you also Infuse it with pyro for a
[00:56:07] bit more damage doesn't really matter
[00:56:08] power swirling doesn't matter that much
[00:56:09] but it's a nice thing uh that you
[00:56:11] usually do in this team and you also
[00:56:12] benett buff your caos damage uh but it
[00:56:14] is what it is it doesn't matter too much
[00:56:16] uh as long as you get the buff on Ryden
[00:56:18] boom you swap to Ryden you burst okay
[00:56:19] that's fine that is very high damage
[00:56:21] your ry's probably
[00:56:22] see2 I don't know how
[00:56:27] you went from this to not killing it for
[00:56:30] another 5 minutes though oh I see what
[00:56:33] happened okay you missed particles oh no
[00:56:34] you got the
[00:56:37] particles quiver
[00:56:40] quiver There Is No Escape just ride in
[00:56:42] burst again man [ __ ]
[00:56:45] it hello hello hello hello that's fine
[00:56:47] it's going to split you're fine you
[00:56:50] didn't need
[00:56:51] to 26 M 300,000 seconds with this Ball's
[00:56:57] ey z x
[00:56:59] heart bro you see which one it is time
[00:57:03] to
[00:57:04] go bro hit the enemy hit the enemy down
[00:57:08] clouds high the birds
[00:57:10] C who are you fighting who are you
[00:57:14] fighting who are you
[00:57:19] fighting bro one with
[00:57:23] nature
[00:57:27] yo this has to be a prank you just
[00:57:35] charge no no you're trolling you're
[00:57:37] actually trolling me you're actually
[00:57:38] trolling you're actually trolling me
[00:57:39] right now you're actually trolling me
[00:57:40] right now you're actually trolling me
[00:57:41] right now you're trolling you're
[00:57:42] actually trolling you're actually
[00:57:43] trolling it on the off trance you don't
[00:57:45] know because we're you know on the off
[00:57:47] trance you don't know okay first of all
[00:57:49] it marks which enemy is the one you have
[00:57:50] to fight you don't you can't fight the
[00:57:52] other ones so you see that you run to it
[00:57:53] instantly that's number one one number
[00:57:55] two when you're
[00:57:57] here what is the benefit of using all
[00:57:59] your bursts with saving ryen you're
[00:58:01] going to have to wait for them anyways
[00:58:03] before using ryen so if you're going to
[00:58:04] go all out [ __ ] press you on Ryden
[00:58:06] her hits give you energy sorry calm down
[00:58:08] it's like you'll get it back anyways the
[00:58:10] alternative is yeah you could save it
[00:58:11] for the big thing but at that point it's
[00:58:13] going to take so long cuz you have no
[00:58:14] source of damage other than Ryden if you
[00:58:15] had maybe a fishal a finina a y Miko
[00:58:18] something that could kill other thing
[00:58:19] sure but you don't so just Q on Ryden
[00:58:21] just press it you'll be able to kill
[00:58:23] both also
[00:58:25] let's say you save your burst sure that
[00:58:27] is cool whatever but first of all I
[00:58:30] don't want to talk about that second of
[00:58:32] all here you want
[00:58:38] to please swirl Electro like it it you
[00:58:41] know how they say it costs nothing to be
[00:58:43] nice it also costs nothing to just swirl
[00:58:46] Electro here you could do any Electro
[00:58:47] you can just Auto attack your Ren's like
[00:58:49] coordinated attack will apply Electro
[00:58:50] swap to
[00:58:52] ryen elect sh news it's fine let me just
[00:58:55] I didn't plan on actually watching one
[00:58:57] now but let's look at the second half
[00:58:58] okay that's good Q nice nice so far so
[00:59:01] good that's fine I mean
[00:59:06] that okay okay okay yo yo please look at
[00:59:11] me in the eyes tell me what this burst
[00:59:14] accomplishes what does this burst
[00:59:16] do I mean I guess you spreaded I mean
[00:59:20] know my
[00:59:23] sword are about to get no not even
[00:59:26] spread as Quicken
[00:59:33] but this is fine this you're actually
[00:59:35] fine this game play is not even that bad
[00:59:38] you're actually fine you can clear month
[00:59:41] wait did you
[00:59:43] clear oh my God yeah you did you
[00:59:47] go to heal cookie okay well if I'm
[00:59:49] actually going to review this okay
[00:59:51] here's what you're supposed to do you
[00:59:52] don't want to use Kookie there because
[00:59:53] Cookie's e only last
[00:59:55] well cool down wise only has 15c cool
[00:59:57] down s's burst is 20 and y's like 18 or
[00:59:59] some [ __ ] I don't know but they're
[01:00:00] they're longer than 15 so you want to
[01:00:02] use the characters with the longer burst
[01:00:04] first so you don't [ __ ] up your order
[01:00:05] because if you use kie and then you use
[01:00:07] SRO it's going to be like you're going
[01:00:09] to run out of kie E before SN CH alt
[01:00:11] runs out and then you have to like swap
[01:00:13] the CI it's going to be weird and also
[01:00:14] you usually rather apply it just also
[01:00:17] bursting there is just a waste of your
[01:00:18] eup time it's not worth it especially if
[01:00:19] there's no hyper cores like hyper Bloom
[01:00:21] cores so you typically just don't want
[01:00:23] to do that in that order but it's
[01:00:27] fine
[01:00:30] anyways no more
[01:00:33] yapping no more
[01:00:36] yapping will you do an updated Dan hang
[01:00:39] by to L guide when his rerun comes out
[01:00:43] maybe I don't know
[01:00:46] yet cookie up time isn't a concern I
[01:00:49] mean no but like do you really want to
[01:00:51] do that like do you really want to okay
[01:00:53] do you really want to have to swap I
[01:00:55] mean swapping doesn't really matter but
[01:00:56] if you swap you lose dendro app cuz
[01:00:58] you're not on Nita and you also it's
[01:01:00] kind of a waste of time it's how do I
[01:01:02] expain how do I how do I explain what is
[01:01:05] the actual reason for it being worse cuz
[01:01:06] I know it's worse but I'm trying to
[01:01:08] figure out the words that Express why
[01:01:10] it's
[01:01:11] worse on a lot of characters you don't
[01:01:13] want to swap out of them and this even
[01:01:15] doesn't matter but you lose out on
[01:01:16] having a normal attacker that doesn't
[01:01:17] suck I think it's just there's no reason
[01:01:20] to using a short cool down before the
[01:01:22] long cool down I don't know
[01:01:25] child e on
[01:01:32] oh the trade-off is Comfort I mean not
[01:01:35] it's also I mean okay there's also a
[01:01:37] difference between pressing cookie e and
[01:01:39] doing
[01:01:43] this the Temple of wi one second Dead
[01:01:46] with me like the E missed and then you
[01:01:49] bursted the Thunder
[01:01:53] manifestation
[01:01:55] witness the power of know my sword but
[01:01:58] yeah it's not that bad to cie e like
[01:02:01] it's fine like even if you did at the
[01:02:03] start
[01:02:04] but um yo chat I know our resin's CA
[01:02:06] what if we did the EO
[01:02:11] event
[01:02:23] oh
[01:02:31] yeah
[01:02:34] also also
[01:02:37] chat I will say because tri's
[01:02:39] constellations are peopleo poooo uh
[01:02:42] farzon being on cloud retainer Banner is
[01:02:44] actually better for Shia assuming her
[01:02:46] constellations are useful or even just
[01:02:47] getting her because like you don't want
[01:02:49] sh like Shia C1 is nice Shia C2 3 four
[01:02:52] five are useless and then C6 is good but
[01:02:54] like thank you for keep so if you
[01:02:57] actually want Faron you'd rather be on
[01:02:58] the cloud retainer Banner if you want to
[01:03:00] get her than on sh's Banner but ideally
[01:03:02] he's on like obviously I wanted on sh's
[01:03:04] Banner too but
[01:03:06] yeah like if you have a C1 sh you're not
[01:03:09] looking for more conations no one was
[01:03:11] like wow I just got C2
[01:03:14] sha okay maybe maybe you said that I

[01:10:58] okay Nita Toma Singo I mean I want to
[01:11:01] see the clear before I see your
[01:11:04] builds okay what is
[01:11:09] this
[01:11:11] okay 20 ping wait what the [ __ ] is
[01:11:15] you're
[01:11:16] playing okay we got ayato Amber Hut
[01:11:20] Barbara
[01:11:22] um
[01:11:27] okay that is a team okay we currently
[01:11:31] are procing
[01:11:34] the hydro
[01:11:44] reaction
[01:11:47] okay I have a question to ask you what's
[01:11:49] your name fried
[01:11:52] flowers I have a question ask you
[01:11:54] so what exactly is the purpose no answer
[01:11:58] me sorry what exactly is the purpose of
[01:12:02] having a character on field Auto attack
[01:12:04] while nothing else happens the other
[01:12:07] three party members in your team are
[01:12:09] just
[01:12:10] idling yeah barbar's rings around you
[01:12:13] Amber pressed
[01:12:17] e what's the purpose of having like your
[01:12:20] of having your Ayo attack with no
[01:12:22] friends
[01:12:24] and then you swap the
[01:12:26] Hut and you know what you do you press
[01:12:29] your burst right away now if you don't
[01:12:31] know this Hut's burst extends the
[01:12:33] duration of her skill so you you usually
[01:12:35] want to do it around the end of your
[01:12:37] skill as it expire is
[01:12:42] expiring okay we do a normal Dash Okay
[01:12:46] normal charge Dash okay yep n N5 okay oh
[01:12:49] n was that a n oh
[01:12:52] my
[01:12:57] misinformation what do you mean
[01:12:58] misinformation it's snap the buff of
[01:13:00] your skill lasts like it'll get
[01:13:02] snapshotted by your burst so it
[01:13:04] technically lasts the whole time it's
[01:13:05] the same thing as extending it the cool
[01:13:07] down still goes though but it does yeah
[01:13:10] like if you burst at the end of your
[01:13:11] skill as it's about to wear off it'll
[01:13:13] still buff your burst even if it like
[01:13:16] expires mid
[01:13:18] burst
[01:13:22] balls
[01:13:45] I'm going to be honest right
[01:13:52] now I'm going to be
[01:13:55] honest I have never seen this high of a
[01:13:59] health bar when the PMA splits now I'm
[01:14:04] going to look at your characters because
[01:14:05] I don't even think it's like a build
[01:14:06] problem it might be but I don't even
[01:14:08] okay well your cuki has a level three
[01:14:10] talent but it's it as long as she's
[01:14:12] level 90 I don't even think it's a build
[01:14:14] problem I think for the most
[01:14:18] part yeah dude if your IO has [ __ ]
[01:14:22] 200 crit damage Ag and you clear in
[01:14:24] [ __ ] seven years maybe it's a team
[01:14:27] comp
[01:14:30] issue it's not even your it's literally
[01:14:32] not even like your build probably I
[01:14:34] haven't seen your artifacts but it's
[01:14:36] probably not okay it's fine you have a
[01:14:38] two-piece that's not bad that's also not
[01:14:41] bad that's good Quon that's goody yeah
[01:14:46] it's not your build can't believe you
[01:14:47] actually stream more than once a week
[01:14:49] anyways did you like my art of you and
[01:14:51] Shia on Twitter heart
[01:14:55] um uh uh no
[01:15:07] comment yeah I mean a lot of this is
[01:15:09] just your team building also I'm going
[01:15:11] to say this I don't get people that
[01:15:13] don't Ascend I don't know
[01:15:16] like is it a flex I'm not sure Ascend so

[01:16:11] blooms you're kind of
[01:16:14] winning but
[01:16:19] yeah
[01:16:21] yeah I don't know if I want to talk
[01:16:23] about that okay well dude let's save

[01:17:41] though I'm going to be
[01:17:43] honest no disrespect to your Bloom team
[01:17:47] but I feel like running any form of
[01:17:48] Bloom on nevet is worse than just
[01:17:50] playing nevet cuz nevet is so good
[01:17:52] however
[01:17:54] I mean it should still
[01:18:01] work I

[01:19:04] 50 he scales on
[01:19:07] defense streamer asks for scuff Tois
[01:19:10] runs and then gets stun locked when he
[01:19:12] gets scuffed runs
[01:19:15] iant
[01:19:17] yeah cuz I expect better from
[01:19:21] you
[01:19:25] this is the Jeff ass second half team by
[01:19:27] the
[01:19:35] way oh my
[01:19:38] God 324 ping it is what it is you know
[01:19:42] you can't really do much about that why
[01:19:44] you R Navia
[01:19:51] ETO
[01:20:05] dude respectfully what am I
[01:20:11] [Music]
[01:20:16] watching
[01:20:21] what
[01:20:34] bro okay okay you are actually a God I
[01:20:38] was about to Flame you for bit alting
[01:20:40] like in the middle of nowhere but you
[01:20:42] literally baited him into it you kind of
[01:20:45] got really lucky but also genius yep and
[01:20:48] then he TVs into
[01:20:51] it
[01:20:56] I mean you're crystallizing once a patch
[01:20:58] but it's
[01:21:10] fine
[01:21:15] dude bro
[01:21:21] you
[01:21:24] [Music]
[01:21:27] that's actually not
[01:21:37] [Music]
[01:21:38] even I
[01:21:49] mean this fine honestly
[01:21:58] oh it's
[01:22:01] fine mon Hydra good team yeah monoh
[01:22:04] Hydra is good I usually like going
[01:22:05] kokomi kazua instead of Gan uh one of
[01:22:08] the hydros but this works
[01:22:11] too it can technically be better as well
[01:22:13] like you don't need an auto attacker cuz
[01:22:15] yolan synr for to do so
[01:22:18] much watch of guide make a BT
[01:22:27] how long is this form open and when can
[01:22:30] I find it as our Discord is in the
[01:22:32] announcements Channel if you scroll up a
[01:22:34] little these are wait what about sus
[01:22:37] Among Us
[01:22:39] lover okay let's let's check SS Among Us
[01:22:44] lover okay we got a r in yao yao double
[01:22:46] Hydro hyper Bloom team pretty standard
[01:22:49] this should be good except why are you
[01:22:50] playing this first half so just so you
[01:22:54] know the first half is comprised of a
[01:22:56] hydro talpa who is completely immune to
[01:22:58] hydro damage and you choose to bring SRO
[01:23:02] and yolan instead of just putting this
[01:23:04] team on the second
[01:23:11] half I mean okay this is so far this is
[01:23:16] fine you Ry and did 14k and you didn't
[01:23:19] reset all good I mean you didn't crit
[01:23:21] but it is what it is uh your Ryden is
[01:23:23] doing less damage than a single hyper
[01:23:25] Bloom but it's fine wait are you hyper
[01:23:27] Bloom y Ryden wait your Ryden is
[01:23:30] probably full em but if your r's full em
[01:23:33] why are you alting
[01:23:45] wait you ran that
[01:23:51] hom
[01:23:56] what else would you do ya ya burst or
[01:23:59] play a different you can build your team
[01:24:00] differently bro you don't have to be
[01:24:02] like oh what else you do in the team
[01:24:03] maybe adjust your [ __ ] sorry calm
[01:24:05] down maybe adjust your team to have an
[01:24:06] auto
[01:24:07] attacker what is a full em Ryden going
[01:24:10] to do
[01:24:20] 5K okay this
[01:24:25] fine more Electro look at how little
[01:24:27] dendro you have you don't need the more
[01:24:29] Electro having yao yao on field and her
[01:24:31] burst would be way more efficient or
[01:24:32] having another dendo in the team instead
[01:24:34] of like yeah it's
[01:24:37] fine cuz like look there's literally no
[01:24:39] Bloom no Bloom no Bloom no Bloom let's
[01:24:41] actually count the okay let's count
[01:24:43] let's do a thought exercise together
[01:24:44] okay let's let's count the time since
[01:24:46] the next for the next Bloom 939 okay 939
[01:24:50] no Bloom still no Bloom still no no
[01:24:52] Bloom still no Bloom still no Bloom
[01:24:55] still no Bloom still no Bloom still no
[01:24:58] Bloom okay 10 seconds okay Stone little
[01:25:02] Bloom 15
[01:25:10] seconds wait did you not yaow yaow burst
[01:25:12] this entire floor oh my God you didn't
[01:25:15] use Ya Ya's burst
[01:25:17] once okay respectfully I get double
[01:25:21] Hydro is broken okay Yan broken Sr
[01:25:23] broken but ya Yao's burst is oh you use
[01:25:25] it at the end what H you use it with it
[01:25:28] two seconds
[01:25:29] left now you
[01:25:32] burst I'm going to okay who calm
[01:25:37] down you're telling me you save what is
[01:25:39] this team you have three healers and
[01:25:41] jungly I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm
[01:25:44] done someone call the ambulance I dude
[01:25:47] okay okay okay whoa first of all before
[01:25:51] we move on first of of all play whatever
[01:25:53] you like but in this team uh while all
[01:25:55] characters here are really good double
[01:25:57] Hydro against hydroa is not ideal and
[01:25:58] you want someone on field that can Auto
[01:26:00] attack Ryden usually can but if you're
[01:26:02] building her full em you don't really
[01:26:03] want to and you want to spend time on
[01:26:04] your ya Yao if anything if you are
[01:26:06] playing ya Yao here obviously Nita would
[01:26:08] be better but if you don't have it it's
[01:26:09] fine but Yao Yao's burst is really good
[01:26:12] here because it gives you more dendr app
[01:26:14] yao yao alone see I'm being educational
[01:26:16] yao yao alone isn't enough dendro from
[01:26:18] off field for hyper blo inside of her
[01:26:20] burst she is but her burst doesn't have
[01:26:21] like amazing up time but it's fine you
[01:26:23] at least want to use your Burst when you
[01:26:24] can you didn't use your burst the entire
[01:26:27] half not once but then at the end you're
[01:26:30] like oh you remembered in real time oh I
[01:26:33] have I have ya yaow burst let me use it
[01:26:36] and then it the you didn't even summon a
[01:26:38] you summoned one more yugu and then it
[01:26:40] ended you have no energy for the next
[01:26:41] half it's okay let's watch the second
[01:26:45] team BYU kakomi Kookie Jang Le
[01:26:50] so I'm not even going to talk let's just
[01:26:52] watch watch okay jly Shield good I mean
[01:26:54] the pillar got destroyed it's fine I
[01:26:56] mean kie e literally does nothing here
[01:26:58] by the way
[01:26:59] literally he yo he's Electro immune he's
[01:27:04] Electro what you didn't even
[01:27:06] apply okay okay ki e by you that's fine
[01:27:11] this is all fine right now okay you're
[01:27:14] blooming you're hyper blooming okay
[01:27:17] coomi burst extends the duration of your
[01:27:19] jelly
[01:27:21] ha
[01:27:23] okay you're on Prototype star glitter
[01:27:25] okay okay okay okay okay
[01:27:31] okay okay first of all why did you jly
[01:27:35] burst second of all you swapped out of
[01:27:37] Ki burst now I get it as a support and
[01:27:39] like a freeze team you burst to extend
[01:27:42] your your jellyfish and then you swap
[01:27:43] out but you don't have a main DPS on
[01:27:45] this steam so your best source of damage
[01:27:48] is ki's burst like that's the highest
[01:27:50] the highest damage you can get on field
[01:27:52] is auto attacking ki's burst the slight
[01:27:54] exception here is you might not have
[01:27:55] enough dendra op you might need to
[01:27:57] attack on baiju cuz your team comp kind
[01:27:59] of sucks you would rather have another
[01:28:00] dendro or like a Nita or something but
[01:28:03] still swapping it to baiju would have
[01:28:04] got swapping it to Jang Le burst to do
[01:28:07] how much damage let's
[01:28:09] see
[01:28:14] 177,000 okay this is fine more D from
[01:28:17] BYU that's
[01:28:18] fine
[01:28:20] okay um
[01:28:26] um yo yo yo
[01:28:42] um okay so the Thunder manifestation
[01:28:45] dashed away from your jellyfish you now
[01:28:48] have no Hydro application so please
[01:28:50] right here use your BYU burst for
[01:28:52] offield dendro and swap into your kakomi
[01:28:54] to actually apply Hydro swap into your
[01:28:57] Ki swap into your Ki
[01:29:00] kakomi KI you are playing spread BYU you
[01:29:04] are playing spread BYU BYU does not play
[01:29:06] spread kokomi Ki KI thank you
[01:29:17] now
[01:29:20] I
[01:29:23] I use hyperblue on both sides I still
[01:29:26] can 36 star though and I'm not sure why
[01:29:27] since I see many people using hyper blue
[01:29:29] guess it's just a skill
[01:29:31] issue okay to roast me
[01:29:35] okay since this is not troll I will give
[01:29:37] you genuine
[01:29:39] advice it's not entirely a skill issue
[01:29:42] it is primarily a team issue
[01:29:46] okay hyper Blom is
[01:29:48] good but you need to know what you're up
[01:29:50] against if you're going up against the
[01:29:52] hydro TPA the double Hydro team that is
[01:29:54] genuinely like Yan SRO anything is good
[01:29:57] you should probably put second half okay
[01:29:59] that's one two you want an on Fielder
[01:30:02] since we know you have all of these
[01:30:04] characters available in that first team
[01:30:06] you could even use like BYU on field I
[01:30:08] know BYU on field kind of has [ __ ] range
[01:30:10] but better than nothing you could run
[01:30:11] kokomi instead of someone else although
[01:30:13] you would want that second half cuz
[01:30:15] hydroa but anyways second team you're
[01:30:17] running three arguably four healers
[01:30:19] three healers and a shielder
[01:30:23] let me look at your let me look at
[01:30:26] then okay builds I just saw vescent hunt
[01:30:29] on Yan by the way okay
[01:30:39] um wait what was
[01:30:49] that okay
[01:30:52] so with Ryden you want to do one of two
[01:30:54] things you either want to Stack crit and
[01:30:57] energy recharge and attack or go full em
[01:31:00] in a hybri li team you want to go full
[01:31:02] em I personally am the biggest hater of
[01:31:06] hybrid builds in genion Impact it almost
[01:31:09] never works please stop what are you
[01:31:12] going to do with 13 crit rate it doesn't
[01:31:14] matter how much ER you have it doesn't
[01:31:15] matter how much crit damage you have if
[01:31:17] you have 13 crit rate what is the point
[01:31:20] please stack Elemental m so your hyper
[01:31:22] blooms do a lot more damage she's level
[01:31:26] 90 though which is good staff of H is uh
[01:31:29] not ideal here uh Kain cross spear
[01:31:32] Dragon Bane would be better yao yao uh
[01:31:35] fav that's good deepwood that's good
[01:31:37] this is fine fine Ya Ya that's fine
[01:31:39] that's fine
[01:31:41] yolan that's actually okay Veron Hunt is
[01:31:44] a bit weird but this is actually good
[01:31:46] this is actually good this is actually
[01:31:47] good okay sing that
[01:31:57] it's fine it's fine it's okay SRO is
[01:32:00] valuable even if all he does is apply
[01:32:02] Hydro the problem is you would like to
[01:32:05] have um you don't need that much ER on a
[01:32:08] double Hydro team with sack sword and
[01:32:11] yolon ER is like especially even without
[01:32:13] like you don't even need sack sword
[01:32:14] because you're running yon but you can
[01:32:16] you would ideally have more
[01:32:18] crit investment but it's fine like it's

[01:40:06] enemy you if you would have tapped your
[01:40:07] e okay you just you tap it on your iPad
[01:40:10] it would have placed it normally it
[01:40:11] probably would have broken you could
[01:40:12] also aim it on anywhere else you put it

[01:41:02] bust Here Comes The
[01:41:05] Catch Hold the Line let's move
[01:41:10] out okay uh I think we've seen enough
[01:41:14] what do they
[01:41:17] say Albero Shang Ling Yan Ki
[01:41:28] uh how much er do you
[01:41:34] have yo if you're on 250 ER and you're
[01:41:39] still not getting your burst like you
[01:41:42] might need a different team comp
[01:41:45] also it's basically impossible to solo
[01:41:48] pyro Shang Ling unless you have like f
[01:41:50] have Lance
[01:41:52] also you have like no crit so there's no
[01:41:55] point in even running shling in that
[01:41:59] team your albo's fine although I don't
[01:42:01] really know why you're on Skyward blade
[01:42:04] um that is not
[01:42:10] ideal okay it's
[01:42:13] fine that's not
[01:42:16] great that is
[01:42:19] terrible
[01:42:23] um honestly it's still more of a team
[01:42:26] comp issue than like an artifact issue
[01:42:28] cuz there you shouldn't be
[01:42:31] running is it hard de better for albo
[01:42:33] yes you shouldn't be running
[01:42:37] um let me resume
[01:42:40] this oh yeah actually almost cleared
[01:42:42] here there's no reason to run Shang Ling
[01:42:44] here with zero energy like you have 250
[01:42:46] ER you still can't get your burst why is
[01:42:48] she in the why is she in the team like
[01:42:50] you're using your reversal once per
[01:42:52] half oh I said hard depth yeah I meant
[01:42:54] to say
[01:42:55] Harbinger uh there's no reason so like
[01:42:58] if you want to play this team you could
[01:43:00] run another like I mean finina would be
[01:43:04] good here I don't know you have SRO and
[01:43:05] then anemo you could do monoh Hydro you
[01:43:07] could do like electrocharge taser you I
[01:43:10] don't really know your characters did
[01:43:12] you show them no but I wouldn't
[01:43:15] recommend that team if you want to do a
[01:43:16] strangling team just run
[01:43:19] benett
[01:43:21] yeah this is
[01:43:34] fine I
[01:43:37] mean
[01:43:39] okay um what's your
[01:43:44] ratio show me your
[01:43:49] ratio okay don't that's fine your Kookie
[01:43:52] has 300 em why does your cookie have 300
[01:43:55] em you don't even need sub stats for
[01:43:57] cookie you literally could just go em
[01:43:59] sand em goblet em ciret and you're good
[01:44:01] to
[01:44:03] go you have an iron sting this means
[01:44:06] your artifacts have like 100 em on them
[01:44:08] what how does this even happen you have
[01:44:11] guilded
[01:44:15] dream bro why are you on an ER build
[01:44:18] this is a good flower this flower is
[01:44:20] actually not bad good
[01:44:23] flower a
[01:44:25] feather you have an ER sand I
[01:44:36] mean it was aggravate wait what was your
[01:44:39] first
[01:44:40] team oh okay you are running aggravate
[01:44:43] okay no not even why would you run
[01:44:46] healing bonus or no no stop first of all
[01:44:50] especially with with Ryden well
[01:44:51] especially with Ryden you're not going
[01:44:52] to need that much ER that's one second
[01:44:54] of all especially in well in any team
[01:44:57] especially without finina but also just
[01:44:59] in general you're not going to need
[01:45:00] healing bonus third of all I typically
[01:45:08] would inuma shines
[01:45:15] Eternal is no
[01:45:19] yeah it's fine the it's fine I think the
[01:45:24] second team is just a bit of a disaster
[01:45:26] that's
[01:45:32] all that's all we can watch more of them
[01:45:35] another day I
[01:45:37] think making an actual thing the Pumpkin
[01:45:41] King you know what fine we'll watch a
[01:45:43] good one we'll watch a good one 36 Stars
[01:45:45] this has to be
[01:45:49] good
[01:45:56] okay yeah this is a good build okay show
[01:45:58] me what you can
[01:46:01] do show me what you can
[01:46:06] do okay 30 ER 26 ping so I expect uh a
[01:46:11] lot of game play gam playing okay you're
[01:46:13] just Auto I don't know why you just Auto
[01:46:16] attack three times on the heat up are
[01:46:17] you trying to force a mechanic you
[01:46:19] trying to force a attack pattern Maybe
[01:46:20] nice burst
[01:46:22] the wait did you the Temple of did you
[01:46:26] mark oh you did okay Mark burst nice
[01:46:29] finina EQ that's fine yep yeah that's
[01:46:32] fine
[01:46:34] uh I mean you're not using Alum okay
[01:46:37] that's
[01:46:38] fine you are on low ping so you could
[01:46:40] have done that uh between your alam's
[01:46:43] burst and your normal you could have
[01:46:45] dumbed this Nita e in the middle or kie
[01:46:47] e in the middle but it's fine this is
[01:46:48] still fine yep okay that's fine uh N5
[01:46:53] okay you might want to use your e around
[01:46:55] now you did a charge attack that works
[01:46:57] okay you got a two mirror there that's
[01:47:00] not ideal but it's fine you got enough
[01:47:01] damage so it's okay you could use I
[01:47:04] would have used Nikita's burst during
[01:47:06] the down time cuz there's literally
[01:47:07] nothing happening here you could have
[01:47:08] swapped an Nita bursted right there it's
[01:47:09] fine it's okay we're not not everyone's
[01:47:12] perfect like me this is okay Mark the
[01:47:14] enemy marked enemy yep nice
[01:47:17] yep here you
[01:47:19] are
[01:47:22] see you have no stamina so you couldn't
[01:47:24] charge attack so you're forced to just
[01:47:26] sit there and two
[01:47:27] mirror what you could have done if I
[01:47:30] mean I still would have bursted probably
[01:47:31] on a hey there uh but if you don't want
[01:47:33] to burst you could have Eed in the air
[01:47:36] and then plunged cost no stamina hold e
[01:47:39] aim it in the air plunge you get three
[01:47:40] mirrors instantly but it's okay I would
[01:47:43] have just bursted but whatever Auto
[01:47:44] Target kind of [ __ ] you up is what it
[01:47:46] is uh but a nice little tip for
[01:47:49] you uh swapping out here is fine I think
[01:47:54] using your using your deita burst was
[01:47:56] definitely a waste of time there though
[01:47:57] and
[01:48:01] energy okay that's
[01:48:04] fine uh what is this team double Hydro
[01:48:07] Hut good team did you just did you just
[01:48:11] tap
[01:48:15] eat okay I mean maybe you
[01:48:19] misclicked
[01:48:22] oh wait why do you have your is oh
[01:48:25] you're C2 you're C2 you're C2 I was like
[01:48:26] why do you get a shield okay you're C2
[01:48:28] witness the power of okay know my sword
[01:48:32] that's fine Auto attack e you didn't we
[01:48:34] even Auto ATT
[01:48:36] attack bro what are you
[01:48:40] doing quiet
[01:48:43] now this isn't Kujo
[01:48:46] Sora
[01:48:48] see go
[01:48:57] on
[01:48:58] fire it's fine though let me leave you a
[01:49:01] first it's not it's not bad it's just
[01:49:03] like you I don't know here comes the C
[01:49:07] gotcha why should they na a e cuz you
[01:49:09] queed on Singo if you burst on SR and
[01:49:11] then you swap to a character there's
[01:49:13] basically no reason for you to not weave
[01:49:15] in a normal attack so like here for uh
[01:49:18] where's the first rotation here for
[01:49:19] example or Y right here for example you
[01:49:21] want Auto right before you e it's free
[01:49:23] free real estate you fire rain swords
[01:49:25] and your coordinated dice [ __ ] that's so
[01:49:27] much damage you just missed out for not
[01:49:28] attacking then you you should are you
[01:49:31] see one was that two e yeah so you could
[01:49:33] have Auto attacked you could have Auto
[01:49:34] attacked here boom like [ __ ] 20K
[01:49:36] damage or some [ __ ] then you could have
[01:49:38] Auto attacked again here but instead you
[01:49:39] eat
[01:49:41] again and then you Kudo SAR the ground
[01:49:45] this is fine though good in gameplay for
[01:49:47] the most part like it's fine make sure
[01:49:49] you get your burst
[01:49:51] on mean
[01:49:53] 20K solid let me we you a first outes
[01:49:57] your this is good here comes the
[01:50:01] catcha quietly now yeah 20K was a very
[01:50:03] generous like very low ball estimate it
[01:50:05] could be a lot more especially cuz this
[01:50:07] thing show is probably
[01:50:09] C6 and the Fin's pretty high I mean the
[01:50:12] um yeah like look at these numbers
[01:50:18] right not bad though I mean overall not
[01:50:22] bad shower me with the process of
[01:50:31] elimination um
[01:50:35] quicker bro how high is your sensitivity
[01:50:37] by the
[01:50:40] way strong you're like spinning your
[01:50:43] camera
[01:50:45] sometimes fine this is not bad like this
[01:50:47] is pretty
[01:50:49] good
[01:50:54] minus one event I will do the event I
[01:50:57] will do the
[01:51:02] event play for fun I want to do those
[01:51:05] stressful my artifact look is
[01:51:07] garbage okay this looks like someone who
[01:51:10] genuinely needs advice so I'll be nice
[01:51:13] this time we won't laugh we won't laugh
[01:51:16] we'll be nice okay everyone watch will
[01:51:18] be nice so first of all at your
[01:51:20] characters right away let's say I were
[01:51:21] to make a team in general I know in this
[01:51:23] Abyss it could be a bit different cuz
[01:51:24] it's like a hydrop and [ __ ] in general I
[01:51:27] would do there's actually a lot of teams
[01:51:28] you could do you do kaching aggravate
[01:51:30] with uh either a dendro like Kirara or
[01:51:32] Nita either of the dendros or you could
[01:51:35] do just a normal hyper BL team you could
[01:51:36] do Nikita finina SRO like um oh no maybe
[01:51:41] Nita SRO Kookie and then Flex based on
[01:51:43] who you have you could do a Hut team Hut
[01:51:45] fora sing Cho and then like a Bennett or
[01:51:47] Jean or some [ __ ] you could do Shia do
[01:51:50] you have farzon I don't know you do Shia
[01:51:52] farzon Bennett finina or Jean instead of
[01:51:55] Bennett there's a lot of stuff you could
[01:51:56] do here you do Navia that works Navia
[01:51:58] can have good teams uh Navia finina is
[01:52:00] good Navia finina Bennett very good
[01:52:01] Shang Ling is Shang Ling so uh Shang
[01:52:04] Ling kaching aggravate okay
[01:52:08] wait
[01:52:11] uh I really don't like kaching aggravate
[01:52:15] without fishal I'm going to be honest I
[01:52:17] don't also yes this current Abyss does
[01:52:20] have hydro tulpa uh but that doesn't
[01:52:22] mean you need to build teams just for
[01:52:24] one Abyss because it's going to change
[01:52:26] you don't have to like completely shift
[01:52:27] your account but for this Abyss I would
[01:52:30] however uh yes I would use Fishel here I
[01:52:34] would do kaching Fishel and then Nita
[01:52:36] Callo if you don't need a Healer if you
[01:52:38] do need a Healer unironically I would go
[01:52:40] Kirara or Yao yaa or baiju instead of
[01:52:43] Nita I think Nita is [ __ ] broken but
[01:52:45] kaching aggravate is the only team in
[01:52:47] the game where sometimes I use the
[01:52:49] dendra that is is a Nita because it's
[01:52:51] just you barely need any dendro you're
[01:52:53] just quickening like all you need is
[01:52:54] you're spamming aggravate you only need
[01:52:56] a little bit of
[01:52:57] dendro Nita is still really good don't
[01:52:59] get me wrong but yeah like you can use
[01:53:01] even Kirara or Yaya or whatever but this
[01:53:03] this is fine it's just um Nita [ __ ] up
[01:53:06] the swirl yes but not really so what
[01:53:10] you're supposed to do this team you can
[01:53:11] Nita burst I actually show this my Nita
[01:53:13] guy that I recorded but what you do is
[01:53:15] you just apply Electro Kaza swirl and
[01:53:17] then you go nitao it's not that hard but
[01:53:20] yeah I I would run official with
[01:53:22] kaching okay let's
[01:53:26] look okay you have 400 [ __ ] whatever
[01:53:29] those are by the
[01:53:31] way
[01:53:33] e hello could you check my Abyss clear
[01:53:37] out next it's floor 11 because skill is
[01:53:40] you but I really need help thank you
[01:53:43] love your
[01:53:44] streams okay a few things first of all I
[01:53:49] know normally um first of all I'm going
[01:53:53] to say it I think kookie's burst if you
[01:53:55] the enem is not dental and you're not
[01:53:56] aggravating a bunch is complete garbage
[01:53:58] I don't think this ability is worth
[01:53:59] pressing unless the enem is dendro so
[01:54:01] you should Nita first but if you wanted
[01:54:03] that you can also swirl Electro first
[01:54:04] but if you're going to swirl Electro
[01:54:05] first don't cooki burst before you swirl
[01:54:07] Electro you lose a lot of damage and
[01:54:08] you're not quickening but anyways uh and
[01:54:11] you should probably start with the burst
[01:54:13] however usually I don't mind holding
[01:54:16] skill on kazwa if it helps you group if
[01:54:18] it's convenient if you just [ __ ] want
[01:54:19] to usually it's fine here's one of the
[01:54:21] few times I think it's objectively bad
[01:54:23] to hold e cuz like it's such a waste of
[01:54:25] time like the only you're not really
[01:54:27] getting much from it it makes your cool
[01:54:28] down longer it's just kind of annoying
[01:54:30] uh burst that's fine that's fine e and
[01:54:33] then Q yeah that's good and then you e
[01:54:35] again okay unfortunately he dodged away
[01:54:38] but it's fine um popping in to say balls
[01:54:41] balls this is fine you might want to
[01:54:43] swap characters though cuz it's a quick
[01:54:45] swap team you don't want to just be okay
[01:54:46] that's fine I mean you could okay that's
[01:54:49] fine uh
[01:54:51] um I mean that wasn't really a great
[01:54:53] swirl but it's okay uh maybe apply
[01:54:55] Electro here yep q and then e and then
[01:54:57] make sure you swirl Electro on Kaa if
[01:54:58] you go fast you can get it okay you
[01:54:59] didn't SW Electro that's fine
[01:55:05] um
[01:55:10] um is your kaching on [ __ ]
[01:55:17] TF uh what's your King on let's
[01:55:22] see Miss spitter that's
[01:55:27] good okay that explains a
[01:55:30] lot a lot of the times I think there's
[01:55:33] many sets you can go and sub stats are
[01:55:35] good as well but with kaching there is
[01:55:37] virtually no reason not to go for TF
[01:55:40] even like it's so good not only is it
[01:55:43] more energy it's way more damage because
[01:55:44] you can you literally can spam your e
[01:55:46] you can quick swap more you can just
[01:55:47] it's just so much better um
[01:55:50] the build this is insane this is also
[01:55:52] insane this is pretty good this is
[01:55:54] whatever this is also pretty good like
[01:55:56] your artifacts are good uh and your
[01:55:59] triple
[01:56:00] crowned I still think you should have
[01:56:02] used fishal
[01:56:04] though but
[01:56:07] yeah what if the forp sucks then Farm
[01:56:10] forehead strong box it like yeah sub
[01:56:12] stats are more important but like it's
[01:56:14] really 4tf is like quite a bit
[01:56:18] better t for TS have a good TS set
[01:56:20] Thunder sother would be good on like
[01:56:22] your let's say you have FAL in that team
[01:56:23] you can go Thunder Suther fal's actually
[01:56:26] like can use it C6 especially if you
[01:56:28] have enough Electro I know Nikita can
[01:56:29] kind of [ __ ] it up but for the most part
[01:56:32] um but on kaching you really want
[01:56:34] thundering Fury almost said Twisted Fate
[01:56:37] anyways it's fine
[01:56:41] um yeah okay what is the second half all
[01:56:44] right I want to see Navia burst I want
[01:56:46] to see Navia burst I don't like Navia
[01:56:48] solo Geo as much but this is a pretty
[01:56:50] good team so it's fine I really want to
[01:56:51] see Navia burst especially as a solo GE
[01:56:53] you want to start crystallizing as soon
[01:56:55] as possible yep Navia burst Navia burst
[01:56:57] Navia burst Navia burst NAIA burst Nava
[01:56:59] burst Navia burst Navia Navia burst
[01:57:01] Navia okay Navia burst
[01:57:06] um and this is fine okay you might want
[01:57:10] to hold e on your Navia just a little
[01:57:11] bit like quick
[01:57:13] scope least 11 mons minus 11 I love ball
[01:57:17] your Navia actually does good damage you
[01:57:19] just probably wanted to burst on her
[01:57:20] first that's
[01:57:23] all going to hold you
[01:57:26] here yeah unlucky no
[01:57:29] crit that's
[01:57:32] fine yeah that's honestly
[01:57:38] fine hey what is happening here how did
[01:57:41] this enemy take you a minute to
[01:57:46] kill okay look at what I do me
[01:57:48] personally look at this look at this
[01:57:50] look at this cookie e to apply Electro
[01:57:53] swap to Kazo swirl swap to Nita apply
[01:57:56] dendro swap the
[01:57:57] kaching
[01:57:59] dead okay are you going Electro swirl
[01:58:02] nice I mean I would have tapped e not
[01:58:04] hold but it's fine uh please mark to
[01:58:06] apply dendro nice kaching EQ
[01:58:10] yep that's fine uh yeah I mean this enem
[01:58:14] is just strangling it
[01:58:17] happens it's fine
[01:58:23] yeah also this team sucks against the
[01:58:24] hydroa so I assume this took you like
[01:58:26] five
[01:58:28] hours wait
[01:58:35] what tap tab not e q if you're talking
[01:58:38] about uh kaching you're objectively
[01:58:39] wrong you want to e and then Q so that
[01:58:41] your cool down
[01:58:42] resets if you e and Q on kaching by the
[01:58:45] time your burst animation is over and
[01:58:46] you press e again you teleport to it and
[01:58:49] then your E's off CL on you can e e
[01:58:50] again it's like so much better it's
[01:58:52] actually not even close it's like
[01:58:54] insanely better it's like actually like
[01:58:56] a world difference look I'll show youus
[01:58:59] look look
[01:59:02] look you should change your stream
[01:59:04] category to just
[01:59:07] yapping you need one n onec in between
[01:59:10] yeah but you can also do that after the
[01:59:12] EAP you but
[01:59:15] yeah
[01:59:18] look
[01:59:22] I usually do it after the EAP I don't
[01:59:23] know if it matters but look so let's say
[01:59:25] you do like I don't
[01:59:29] know I shouldn't he bursted first it
[01:59:31] doesn't matter but the point is look the
[01:59:33] point is just the kaching stuff so look
[01:59:34] let's say you e q then you e again and
[01:59:38] then you do wait I don't have TF what
[01:59:40] the [ __ ] is my kach on wait she's not on
[01:59:43] TF she's not on TF she's not on
[01:59:48] TF wait wait wait wa wait wait wait wait
[01:59:50] wait wait where the [ __ ] is she wait bro
[01:59:53] she's not geared how's that my
[01:59:56] fault bro bro she's not
[02:00:05] geared okay ignore
[02:00:09] that stop typing gearing badge okay let
[02:00:12] me let me run this
[02:00:15] back I mean okay let's let's run [ __ ]
[02:00:20] yeah yeah
[02:00:32] here okay so let's say you e q look at
[02:00:35] this e again I do a charge tack boom E's
[02:00:39] already off cool down then you can e
[02:00:40] again whereas if you don't do that look
[02:00:42] at the difference look at the difference
[02:00:43] look at the
[02:00:47] difference look at the difference
[02:00:52] I just swirled nothing doesn't matter
[02:00:54] look at the difference if you e e and
[02:00:55] then Q you [ __ ]
[02:00:59] blue it's
[02:01:01] fine right
[02:01:08] back okay look if you please don't fly
[02:01:10] if you eat this [ __ ] this [ __ ] he's
[02:01:13] a [ __ ] it's fine I'll wait I'll wait
[02:01:15] for him to not
[02:01:18] fly
[02:01:21] can can official apply Electro doesn't
[02:01:23] matter please don't fly please don't
[02:01:24] it's fine I'll just wait I'll just wait
[02:01:25] doesn't
[02:01:26] matter look if you e e and then
[02:01:35] Q one
[02:01:45] sec guide maker don't talk to
[02:01:48] me
[02:01:55] oh I [ __ ]
[02:01:58] up I mean wait I guess you can e and
[02:02:01] then Q you just don't want to q and then
[02:02:02] e e I guess it doesn't
[02:02:06] matter well actually I think it does
[02:02:08] matter is it there's some cool down that
[02:02:10] lines up wait let me pull it up I know
[02:02:12] there's a reason wait is
[02:02:13] it I guess it might not matter does it
[02:02:17] matter at my own guide cuz you're on TF
[02:02:22] oh yeah
[02:02:24] but okay I guess that's
[02:02:29] why wait but when are you ever going to
[02:02:31] run King non on TF
[02:02:38] though that might be the combo without
[02:02:46] TF um
[02:03:17] yeah
[02:03:28] eqe I know like I know eqe is the is
[02:03:31] what you're supposed to do but I'm
[02:03:32] trying to see if it actually matters on
[02:03:34] TF it might
[02:03:35] not let me
[02:03:46] see oh it's for longer okay okay that's
[02:03:53] why okay that's why it's okay so it
[02:03:57] doesn't really matter if you're on TF
[02:03:59] but I think the point is to have longer
[02:04:01] Electro infusion so if you do this
[02:04:03] you're infused here and then you not
[02:04:05] you're like wasting up time on your
[02:04:07] burst and then if you're not on TF it
[02:04:08] might run
[02:04:09] out like see how it yeah okay it runs
[02:04:12] out before my e comes up but if you're
[02:04:14] on TF it doesn't really matter cuz it's

[02:22:37] trying to time it appr Ang Ang married
[02:22:41] this in two months I have a big I didn't
[02:22:43] know mind if I we are not dismiss your
[02:22:46] you make me all right right time to the
[02:22:49] Perry does he play Elden ring dude I was
[02:22:51] playing when I played Dark Souls 3 I had
[02:22:53] to learn to I spent like [ __ ] like
[02:22:56] six hours learning to Parry to beat
[02:22:57] [ __ ] pontiff Sullivan that guy took
[02:22:59] me like a
[02:23:12] week
[02:23:15] ah no
[02:23:19] okay good
[02:23:20] damage oh okay I see why you have to
[02:23:22] Parry I
[02:23:24] mean bro hold the [ __ ] good nice
[02:23:28] watch shoot me shoot me shoot me shoot
[02:23:31] me never
[02:23:35] mind
[02:23:41] okay hypothetically should we run the
[02:23:44] motherb bird with VI or song of days
[02:23:46] past what do you mean
[02:23:49] hypothetically let me raise you the
[02:23:51] following concern I mean uh a dilemma I
[02:23:54] mean answer when would you ever run
[02:23:57] anemo support not on 4vv the answer is
[02:24:00] if you don't need it but for the most
[02:24:01] part it's pretty
[02:24:12] broken Shia Scara no that's not true if
[02:24:15] you're playing a Scara team you're
[02:24:17] either running 4vv on an Nemo support or
[02:24:19] you're playing a bad scar team cuz what
[02:24:21] what oh I pressed Q what are you doing
[02:24:23] Scara hyper carry with like no damage
[02:24:25] supports maybe if you're doing like
[02:24:26] Faron benett Toma sure but like I feel
[02:24:29] like most scar teams want like SRO or
[02:24:31] like fishal or like something I mean you
[02:24:32] could do finina MAA but finina deals
[02:24:35] really good damage and in a finina team
[02:24:37] you want 4vv on someone like even with
[02:24:39] sha if you're doing sha farzon finina
[02:24:42] you probably want 4vv on like your other
[02:24:44] Nemo like Gan or maybe Cloud retainer
[02:24:49] cuz F does a lot of damage you could go
[02:24:51] like another set but a lot of the times
[02:24:54] forv is really good even for just your
[02:25:02] supports oh wa I thought it was the
[02:25:04] other one wait how do I
[02:25:15] okay
[02:25:17] ah want to put sh scar on 4vv in the
[02:25:20] first place cuz no one wants to do that
[02:25:22] you can 4vv scar is unironically
[02:25:25] sometimes the best like you actually
[02:25:28] can but I feel like like I don't want to
[02:25:31] play Shia as a [ __ ] like buffer but
[02:25:33] like you can so that's how you yep when
[02:25:37] you're up against when your
[02:25:39] tactics I think she know but I'll mull
[02:25:41] it
[02:25:45] over
[02:25:50] atmost miked is this the last one surely
[02:25:52] not there has to be a fifth one right
[02:25:55] all [ __ ] this
[02:26:11] guy okay so far so good H bro I
[02:26:29] Oh I thought it was a
[02:26:35] ball they didn't even knock
[02:26:45] him [ __ ]
[02:26:47] okay

[02:56:08] [ __ ] I don't care yeah let me save an
[02:56:10] attack goblet for the one character in
[02:56:12] the game that uses that wow wow I love
[02:56:14] having 26 chenho pieces
[02:56:17] woohoo flat attack though flat attack is
[02:56:20] so bad you guys don't even understand if
[02:56:22] you're playing an attack like a
[02:56:23] character that needs to stack attack
[02:56:26] stack
[02:56:29] attack wa wait where's the piece I just
[02:56:31] [ __ ] rolled I can't even find it did
[02:56:33] I unlock it oh it's on
[02:56:43] Leila
[02:56:46] okay dude you're kidding
[02:56:50] right how is this plus
[02:56:53] 20
[02:57:02] how wait I don't even have a goblet that
[02:57:04] has ER bro this is my best
[02:57:13] one
[02:57:30] uh well
[02:57:33] chat statistically speaking one of these
[02:57:36] pieces should roll
[02:57:43] ER
[02:58:04] I'm please statistically speaking okay
[02:58:08] okay I know this looks terrible but at
[02:58:11] each ER roll a baby kitten is saved
[02:58:13] that's not bad one more [ __ ] still our
[02:58:18] best one but it's terrible it's [ __ ]
[02:58:19] garbage but it's still our best one I
[02:58:21] mean we could also go this onet goblet
[02:58:23] but it has no subsets go
[02:58:31] me okay nice although in like a sh team
[02:58:35] probably not going to need a lot of ER
[02:58:36] but for other
[02:58:42] teams
[02:58:51] attack SS
[02:58:53] no there's no re like we don't need
[02:58:55] attack
[02:58:56] SS but I do have a pretty good one I
[02:58:59] think it's probably offset yeah like
[02:59:01] this is really good but on
[02:59:10] shha also I probably won't have her
[02:59:12] weapon day one probably pull it
[02:59:27] later this is going to be enough though
[02:59:30] cuz like let's say we go [ __ ] five or

[03:46:10] best character in the game Faron
[03:46:14] Bennett I I don't know I I really like

[03:46:31] realistic case of it where it's like you
[03:46:33] can't really argue against it
[03:46:35] so cuz like okay think about it vett
[03:46:38] gives you healing d gives you resistance
[03:46:40] Interruption which means okay yeah you
[03:46:42] don't get healed but you're tanky and
[03:46:44] you don't get knocked around and she
