[00:19:30] 1.3 damn these guesses are terrible wait
[00:19:33] let me
[00:19:34] think past 1.3 could be a
[00:19:38] bow uh it could be it could be a bow it
[00:19:42] could be a claymore it could be a sword
[00:19:44] probably a
[00:19:48] sword who's a sword

[00:21:17] [ __ ] break my brain I know it's not a
[00:21:19] cry bow that helps so much cuz now could
[00:21:21] be a claymore or a sword it's probably a

[00:33:27] wow a chrome
[00:33:30] shell wait let me get this [ __ ] cube
[00:33:32] in the
[00:33:34] sky three gacha games
[00:33:38] dude don't talk to
[00:33:48] me also I looked at like some aasha
[00:33:51] stuff apparently so I can minmax my
[00:33:53] artifacts more well if I'm Min maxing I
[00:33:56] aasha dog [ __ ] for that so I shouldn't
[00:33:57] care but if I'm aosa maxing like a
[00:33:59] cringer which I am uh if I get one more
[00:34:02] crit rate roll I go up to like rank five
[00:34:05] so we literally that that means that
[00:34:08] there is like the reverse of diminishing
[00:34:10] returns because we go literally to like
[00:34:12] rank five sh out in the world rank one
[00:34:14] na if we get one better piece so we got
[00:34:17] to get one better piece
[00:34:22] [Music]
[00:34:24] true but like I don't know
[00:34:28] that's also aasha maxing which is
[00:34:30] completely useless because I don't need
[00:34:31] that much crit
[00:34:32] rate or ER well I think I'm on a zero ER
[00:34:35] build but what the [ __ ] is this

[02:02:01] assuming this girl just heals the the
[02:02:03] person's probably better but I I don't
[02:02:17] know

[02:02:30] skill okay oh that's it okay we can do
[02:02:34] the next

[02:03:47] them
[02:03:51] is that thinging dude why are those
[02:03:52] mushrooms unkillable the
[02:04:01] [ __ ] dude why are they actually
[02:04:09] unkillable I
[02:04:17] missed maybe they have like some
[02:04:20] Elemental weakness or some [ __ ] but I
[02:04:21] don't
[02:04:25] know I did like no damage healer moment
[02:04:28] oh that's it okay not bad uh I don't
[02:04:31] think I need to level we could probably
[02:04:32] do this it's
[02:04:42] fine are you trying to pull for

[02:05:24] I I still don't get how the bar at the
[02:05:27] bottom of my screen works but all
[02:05:30] good if only I could read that would
[02:05:32] help a
[02:05:46] lot that might help a little but you
[02:05:48] have to make it relatable the stream cuz
[02:05:50] not everyone reads right it's okay you
[02:05:52] don't have to read to to be a a gamer
[02:05:54] that's what I'm trying to

[02:06:06] miss Auto targeting by the way and I
[02:06:08] still

[02:06:42] plunge perfect Dodge though perfect
[02:06:44] Dodge nice
[02:06:47] h
[02:06:50] okay lowkey the healer's been so useless
[02:06:51] so far like I don't need the
[02:06:58] healing [ __ ] there's more well it's been
[02:07:02] a long this enemy looks like he runs to
[02:07:05] you so I'm going to attack the snipers

[02:07:24] you okay I should probably dude I should

[02:07:43] now
[02:07:47] okay
[02:07:50] why is my bar at the bottom fully
[02:08:17] empty
[02:08:25] okay I missed

[02:08:41] group them
[02:08:47] somehow
[02:08:51] please please please please die please
[02:08:53] die please die please die please die
[02:08:54] please die please
[02:08:55] die why are you hitting the air it's
[02:08:59] fine I didn't want Stars
[02:09:11] anyways okay we are
[02:09:13] definitely chilling but we're definitely
[02:09:17] underleveled
[02:09:20] okay that was
[02:09:40] disgusting can I upgrade this further no
[02:09:42] I can't okay maybe we level I don't want
[02:09:45] to level [ __ ] two star artifacts
[02:09:47] though that feels like a a grief
[02:09:55] move wait it says cost
[02:09:59] four
[02:10:02] flst
[02:10:07] what do I have attack
[02:10:17] percent actually I
[02:10:24] do well I don't need Havoc damage though
[02:10:32] whatever
[02:10:37] anyways ah hello yeah I did it no big
[02:10:42] deal yeah we're skipping
[02:10:47] this
[02:10:51] wait where are my rewards where are my
[02:10:57] rewards oh 100 don't mind if I do 100
[02:11:00] don't mind if I do 100 don't mind if I
[02:11:02] do 100 don't mind if I do 100 don't mind
[02:11:05] if I
[02:11:10] do okay so I need to do
[02:11:12] more H I will I will I will I will I'll
[02:11:15] get three stars one
[02:11:17] second
[02:11:19] ah one second ah one
[02:11:28] second does this character give you a
[02:11:30] damage buff or is she literally just
[02:11:32] healing cuz the healing is so
[02:11:34] irrelevant
[02:11:37] health
[02:11:47] health
[02:11:57] energy that's for
[02:12:00] her damage buff where I can't find it in
[02:12:03] her kit
[02:12:11] Health
[02:12:15] remant momentary Union no it's healing
[02:12:27] there's a 10 pull in your mail
[02:12:31] really this looks like itjust
[02:12:47] heals
[02:12:51] oh this thing what is
[02:12:54] this oh wait what the [ __ ] is an outro
[02:12:56] skill when Prov medical support allowing
[02:12:59] characters on the field to recover her
[02:13:00] Max HP percent lasting 30 seconds on a
[02:13:03] character receives this healing their
[02:13:04] damage in by 50% last for 6 seconds is
[02:13:07] that when like this it shines
[02:13:11] up guess there's intro and outro oh you
[02:13:13] can also level these okay these are
[02:13:15] irrelevant actually
[02:13:24] oh attack okay so you get attack per if
[02:13:27] you level this and you get damage from
[02:13:30] her outro skill okay that's
[02:13:33] cool Nita are you any
[02:13:38] good okay damage
[02:13:44] percent okay this just better wow I'm
[02:13:47] still not playing her
[02:13:54] but how much is this 20% attack yeah 20%
[02:14:00] attack uh that doesn't
[02:14:04] matter 15%
[02:14:08] damage and
[02:14:11] then whatever damage she deals I guess
[02:14:15] no you probably need multiple teams yeah
[02:14:17] that's fair I mean we'll probably use
[02:14:19] her at some point that's that's fair I
[02:14:23] mean I guess we could try I don't know I
[02:14:25] might I'm not going to make a decision
[02:14:26] yet maybe but for now I'd rather just
[02:14:28] level my
[02:14:29] DPS so I'm going to level some [ __ ] I
[02:14:32] I need I don't have good artifacts I'm
[02:14:34] just going to level whatever I have can
[02:14:35] I filter by like attack main set attack
[02:14:37] percent cuz that's I assume the attack
[02:14:40] like the main set is what matters I kind
[02:14:42] of want to go for like this two-piece
[02:14:43] though just to have like an attack wait
[02:14:45] where is it there's a two-piece that
[02:14:46] gives attack where the [ __ ] did it go
[02:14:49] go this
[02:14:50] one I only have one of it it's this what
[02:14:55] is it called I guess there's no set
[02:14:57] name endless
[02:15:03] resonance
[02:15:06] um it gives me glacio though which is
[02:15:09] useless do I have another
[02:15:13] one Electro I'm not
[02:15:16] Electro they have no main
[02:15:19] stats I wonder if set effect is better
[02:15:22] probably not I assume this is the same
[02:15:24] as genin 10% attack how much does the
[02:15:26] set bonus give let me
[02:15:33] see it doesn't even say it just says
[02:15:35] attack increases bro [ __ ] can you
[02:15:37] tell
[02:15:39] me oh 10% wait that's that's less okay
[02:15:43] yeah yeah yeah it's less it's less than
[02:15:45] the main stat how much was the main stat
[02:15:46] giving me yeah
[02:15:51] 10 turn off brief description why do I
[02:15:54] have that on how do I remove
[02:15:57] that oh
[02:15:59] oh okay this is so much
[02:16:02] better okay yeah sorry what the [ __ ] has
[02:16:05] that been on the whole [ __ ] time yo
[02:16:08] that is so much better what the hell
[02:16:11] okay do I have the energy regen so I
[02:16:14] have two piece useless and two piece
[02:16:15] energy regen which is fine
[02:16:18] um I should probably level like one of
[02:16:20] them that gives attack right so defense
[02:16:22] that
[02:16:23] sucks I mean I don't have attack ones I
[02:16:26] have this one attack all right let's
[02:16:27] just max this one
[02:16:29] Whatever 5.8% attack that's probably not
[02:16:32] going to do a big uh difference so I
[02:16:34] might need another character that's also
[02:16:35] leveled or a better something uh but
[02:16:39] maybe I'll level another
[02:16:41] character I wonder if MC is
[02:16:45] good oh I can also level my [ __ ]
[02:16:47] talents why didn't I think about
[02:16:49] that oh no I can't yet can we upgrade
[02:16:51] resonator rank two
[02:17:02] bro I I this guy gives me the vibe like
[02:17:04] he's either complete dog [ __ ] or
[02:17:06] actually pretty
[02:17:09] good ew what the [ __ ] five my scaling is
[02:17:13] five why is there just a five
[02:17:16] here
[02:17:21] is it like a multiplier what let me read
[02:17:24] it
[02:17:27] um oh when it reaches 100 you can cast
[02:17:30] draconic
[02:17:32] Hellfire is that what it
[02:17:37] is I don't
[02:17:45] know I just want I don't know who I feel
[02:17:47] like leveling maybe her but I kind of I
[02:17:50] want another DPS like I only have one
[02:17:51] right
[02:17:54] now does this guy look good let's
[02:17:58] see oh he scales on
[02:18:04] defense honestly
[02:18:14] maybe Gamba and get lucky
[02:18:20] you know what I like the way that you
[02:18:23] think actually I want to save my jles do

[02:31:31] but at least I get the set cuz I don't
[02:31:32] even have
[02:31:34] like I don't have any more attack
[02:31:44] percent what you need more cost to equip
[02:31:47] this
[02:31:54] Echo the
[02:32:01] [ __ ]
[02:32:10] okay okay this piece is good everything
[02:32:12] else kind of sucks oh I could get 10%
[02:32:14] attack if I bench this main set is
[02:32:16] terrible wait do uh I probably don't
[02:32:19] have a pie set of that set right now
[02:32:24] anyways well I do but I can't equip it
[02:32:27] all right
[02:32:30] GG all right he's geared
[02:32:35] enough he is geared
[02:32:39] enough should we try him out let's go to
[02:32:41] the abyss
[02:32:44] again d down
[02:32:49] down down down down
[02:32:58] sorry let me run this
[02:33:01] back uh wait one sec
[02:33:15] chat
[02:33:35] all
[02:33:45] right
[02:33:46] so I need to use her for the like leave
[02:33:51] thing wait why did I [ __ ] mute my
[02:33:56] thing outro
[02:34:06] skill all right let's
[02:34:14] see that guy got [ __ ]
[02:34:17] um so how do I do
[02:34:19] this
[02:34:24] okay school jams I
[02:34:37] see okay this looks very [ __ ] single
[02:34:39] Target
[02:34:41] though also I'm stuck in this like I
[02:34:44] can't
[02:34:45] stop
[02:34:53] there's a lot of damage though compared
[02:34:55] to everything else I've
[02:35:05] used that was almost 1,000
[02:35:14] shees why I low HP yo
[02:35:30] chill I need to fill up okay my bar is
[02:35:32] full so now I need to
[02:35:35] do then I
[02:35:37] can I
[02:35:41] see I mean it does hit in like a line
[02:35:43] it's not that single Target I
[02:35:47] guess outro skill that's intro skill
[02:35:50] actually no
[02:35:56] way okay kind of figuring it
[02:36:08] out bro he's just
[02:36:13] dancing can I hit them oh there you go
[02:36:22] wait
[02:36:23] [Music]
[02:36:30] what bro what I was just
[02:36:44] attacking will you we my waves no I
[02:36:54] won't oh that was the second wave of
[02:36:56] enemies I probably still could a three I
[02:36:58] thought that was the first wave oops
[02:37:09] oopsie I probably should have used that
[02:37:11] before using my alss of time I
[02:37:14] guess
[02:37:20] bro why does he like sometimes like he's
[02:37:21] just jumping instead of
[02:37:24] attacking are you
[02:37:32] dumb you ask for harder content wait are
[02:37:35] you what are you yapping
[02:37:44] about
[02:37:59] okay I don't know how to proc the like
[02:38:02] what makes me able to do an outro skill
[02:38:04] or
[02:38:06] not like I don't know why here sometimes
[02:38:09] I attack sometimes I don't it might be
[02:38:11] the range but like I'm in the air so
[02:38:13] does enemy have to be like Standing Tall
[02:38:14] or some [ __ ] I don't
[02:38:36] know yeah I not sure how this works I
[02:38:39] think you have to like knock them in the
[02:38:40] air I guess you just knock them in the
[02:38:42] air first maybe there's supports that do
[02:38:44] that
[02:38:51] oops wrong
[02:39:00] button [ __ ] I
[02:39:02] missed okay let me do
[02:39:12] that so now I should have a damage buff
[02:39:14] for like six seconds
[02:39:20] oh I can spam this oh that is so much
[02:39:24] better oh okay I see I don't know if
[02:39:28] that's better like damage wise but it
[02:39:30] feels
[02:39:33] better I if I can hop
[02:39:44] around
[02:39:53] okay that makes more sense okay I can't
[02:39:55] use that point blank I can't I couldn't
[02:39:57] swap I was stuck in
[02:40:00] that it's forcing me to take
[02:40:10] damage it's still hard to group these
[02:40:12] enemies
[02:40:14] though
[02:40:19] all right we got one more star confirm
[02:40:20] the
[02:40:26] score
[02:40:28] okay I don't know if I could do this
[02:40:30] level 51 maybe but I'd probably get like
[02:40:33] one
[02:40:36] star H let's try it [ __ ]
[02:40:41] it we are not leveled
[02:40:44] though
[02:40:47] you cannot use this function why won't
[02:40:48] it let me level
[02:40:55] s fix your posture
[02:40:58] never
[02:41:02] never
[02:41:08] never holy what the [ __ ] is
[02:41:13] this we are doing no no
[02:41:16] damage
[02:41:33] yo oh I didn't mean to Que in that I
[02:41:35] didn't mean to Que in that that was so
[02:41:37] dumb it's
[02:41:39] fine yeah we doing no
[02:41:44] damage
[02:41:47] is that even more than this
[02:41:54] character yeah it does not seem like we
[02:41:56] are adequately leveled yet but I we can
[02:42:06] try this guy's not grouping either like
[02:42:08] none of them are grouping does this does
[02:42:10] my turtle do
[02:42:14] anything I guess
[02:42:22] not I guess
[02:42:34] not no okay I DOD that yeah we're doing
[02:42:37] yo we are not killing this thing by the
[02:42:39] way we are not
[02:42:44] winning
[02:42:53] yeah we are not killing this thing by
[02:42:56] the
[02:43:01] way it's also hard to dodge when I'm in
[02:43:03] that that's like swap out I
[02:43:10] think do I even try to clear this I
[02:43:14] don't even think we can
[02:43:16] is there another
[02:43:31] wave oh I it's
[02:43:38] fine y this [ __ ] is
[02:43:43] uh okay well appar there's a second
[02:43:46] attack
[02:43:51] there you're not clearing yo we might we
[02:43:55] might get like like zero like one
[02:44:00] star no we're not yeah we are not we are
[02:44:14] not
[02:44:24] how do I swop this I guess I
[02:44:29] swap that combo like goes on for
[02:44:31] years oh I didn't dodge oh I didn't
[02:44:34] dodge well I don't think you can dodge
[02:44:37] inside of these I think you have to swap
[02:44:38] out right
[02:44:41] yeah okay you actually can't Dodge ring
[02:44:44] those
[02:44:51] unlucky okay well that's
[02:44:56] fine I don't know if I like this
[02:44:58] character I'm going to be honest but he

[03:26:20] attack for the snal r swords burst they
[03:26:22] Auto and then you burst and now look at

[03:26:54] even better
[03:27:02] true

[03:27:17] get waa bursting
[03:27:29] time let me leave you R out can I
[03:27:33] believe the devs are anti dude I'm anti
[03:27:36] too I'm going to say it actually no I'm
[03:27:38] not going to say it fav is good because
[03:27:40] it helps because it's a four-star weapon
[03:27:42] and they're better than five star
[03:27:44] sometimes so it's healthy for the game
[03:27:45] but I [ __ ] hate fav cuz it's like
[03:27:47] dude it literally changes everything Mt
[03:27:50] it actually is
[03:27:51] like I hate it like I love them but I
[03:27:55] hate
[03:28:00] them why
[03:28:03] cuz I okay there are many factors that
[03:28:06] contribute to this not just fav but it
[03:28:08] is no longer possible for me to comment
[03:28:10] on someone's energy recharge what the
[03:28:12] [ __ ] is this by the way uh because you
[03:28:14] can run like 185 characters in your team
[03:28:16] and then you don't need ER anymore and
[03:28:18] then it's just like it's like you get

[03:31:47] your she's not level 77 yeah the most
[03:31:51] important reason to level your

[03:31:55] you're in the in the abyss menu you

[03:37:31] everything nothing to
[03:37:39] fear
[03:37:43] chat how many enemies does this domain

[03:48:01] get a good piece ban
[03:48:03] me I mean you you're just asking to be
[03:48:05] banned I mean I'll do it I'll do it but
[03:48:08] mods can we preemptively ban them cuz
[03:48:10] it's you already know what's good can we
[03:48:12] preemptively ban them can we
[03:48:13] preemptively one day ban I'm a nice man
[03:48:16] I'll let them off the hook actually no
[03:48:18] cuz if it's I leave them too if I'm too
[03:48:20] nice with them then it sets a bad
[03:48:21] example and everyone's going to be like
[03:48:22] oh oh B me next time bet and then it's
[03:48:24] going to be it's going to be too much so
[03:48:26] uh two day
[03:48:28] b or two years up to you mons two days
[03:48:32] or two years Rolland
[03:48:38] dice I'm doing one
[03:48:43] run are you going to r five Jade spear
[03:48:46] when sh run comes
[03:48:48] out uh no but thanks for
[03:48:54] asking definitely not going to r five a
[03:48:57] jade spear but thank you for
[03:49:03] asking can I act as collateral in their
[03:49:06] Ste
[03:49:07] stead what not Banning you as
[03:49:11] well why does everyone want to be
[03:49:16] banned maybe you're just that confident
[03:49:18] it's going to be a good piece maybe
[03:49:20] you're just that confident this piece is
[03:49:22] going to be amazing maybe that's what it
[03:49:24] is when everyone unites right maybe
[03:49:27] that's the message when everyone
[03:49:29] together is like no h not just I believe
[03:49:32] but we believe maybe that's when good
[03:49:34] things happen maybe like this like a
[03:49:36] morality
[03:49:38] lesson
[03:49:40] maybe together we can do
[03:49:43] it let me change Fina
[03:49:46] Dan I went to light mode for this
[03:49:50] piece okay there's literally not there's
[03:49:53] five Echoes not a single Vermilion mods
[03:49:56] uh yeah yeah yeah uh well I mean em
[03:50:01] ciret and sand so you just got a freest
[03:50:03] stun lock
[03:50:07] um well

[03:50:26] perfectly so when I'm done I burst he
[03:50:27] collaps
[03:50:29] me
[03:50:37] break huh
[03:50:39] H
[03:50:42] okay all right last one Vermilion is
[03:50:45] actually optimal if we're trying to
[03:50:47] strong box because there's higher chance
[03:50:49] to get garbage which means on average
[03:50:51] there's more strong boxable
[03:50:54] pieces I hate this domain I hate this
[03:50:56] domain [ __ ] everyone who told me to come
[03:50:58] here [ __ ] you if you're in chat and
[03:50:59] you're like oh go Vermillion I hope I

[03:51:09] with six but three of them are burnt I'm
[03:51:12] sorry that was too

[03:54:07] bad
[03:54:15] you say s to farm Vermilion at Zio you

[03:54:22] like why you're like I have C6 fars on
[03:54:24] wait why though you don't even want
[03:54:34] Echoes can I ask you I'll ask you in
[03:54:36] French B wrong language B
[03:54:49] why it's funny and I'm tired of fing for
[03:54:52] Heroes
[03:54:54] wits dude Z you are okay okay I don't
[03:54:58] know how to say this nicely but like you
[03:55:00] are like the most
[03:55:04] like you are more free to play than like
[03:55:07] free to you're I know like
[03:55:09] I know you're like free to play now for
[03:55:10] like two years or whatever but you're
[03:55:11] like more freeo play than freeo play
[03:55:13] players I don't know to like you like
[03:55:15] cuz Okay I feel like a lot of fre
[03:55:17] players like they kind of like you know
[03:55:18] what I'm going to farm artifacts today
[03:55:19] you're just like oh I have to farm
[03:55:21] heroes wits I have to farm Mora and then
[03:55:24] you never have fun I actually don't even
[03:55:26] understand you you don't
[03:55:30] like no
[03:55:37] okay
[03:55:39] I don't have if can oh wait this good
[03:55:42] this good this good cuz if it gets crit
[03:55:44] rate it's good in general if it gets
[03:55:46] attack it's good on MAR so there's two
[03:55:47] good options if it gets defense it could
[03:55:49] be good on a defense killing Mar cuz
[03:55:51] basically every character in the game
[03:55:52] can use the Set uh this circlet so I'm
[03:55:54] calling it I'm calling this uh piece
[03:55:57] from now a good piece fact checked by
[03:56:00] real American Patriots this piece is
[03:56:01] good I'm calling it early I'm calling it
[03:56:04] early this piece is
[03:56:06] good I'm calling it early
[03:56:10] I'm [ __ ] it epic
[03:56:16] music what would you
[03:56:19] do if you got the most versatile set in
[03:56:22] the
[03:56:23] game and it it came floating down to you
[03:56:26] and said hey look at this
[03:56:28] ciret look at how good it is would you
[03:56:31] capture it would you seize the moment
[03:56:33] would you level it or would you say no
[03:56:35] not good enough n it's going to roll the
[03:56:37] fence n the last that will be flat HP or
[03:56:41] would you click
[03:56:43] enhance and get em that's good now there
[03:56:46] are four venues four avenues for this
[03:56:50] piece to be good K wait attack percent
[03:56:54] em crit
[03:56:57] rate now let me show you what happens if
[03:56:59] I take it a step further if I believe in
[03:57:02] the artifact blindly put my
[03:57:05] faith in a brighter tomorrow
[03:57:12] because you'll never know until you know
[03:57:16] so why
[03:57:19] not let it go that doesn't actually make
[03:57:22] sense but
[03:57:25] oh in
[03:57:29] life if you don't believe then who will
[03:57:37] sometimes sometimes they look
[03:57:42] Grim but if you don't believe in
[03:57:45] yourself then who will believe in
[03:57:48] you that's not bad that's not bad em
[03:57:51] could be good Rizzle could use it uh h
[03:57:54] no not really I mean you know uh uh
[03:57:59] duuke with
[03:58:00] finina
[03:58:02] um swirl
[03:58:05] sh this could be good give me a crit
[03:58:08] raid
[03:58:09] or attack perent actually no I want CR
[03:58:28] rate I have like six pieces like this I
[03:58:32] mean it's not bad it's it's it's fine
[03:58:35] it's
[03:58:37] fine
[03:58:44] LOL it's okay if every piece is a winner
[03:58:47] chat then no piece is a winner if this
[03:58:49] is how every piece rolls then I'm not
[03:58:50] relatable okay this is actually not even
[03:58:52] bad okay it's not even bad it's fine
[03:58:55] it's
[03:59:00] fine it's fine it's better than some of
[03:59:03] the pieces I have locked
[03:59:05] okay uh like this one on Rizzle has 80
[03:59:08] two flat attack what the [ __ ] is wrong
[03:59:10] with me why do I have that what I just
[03:59:13] rolled is uh better right where is it
[03:59:16] where is it there you go it's
[03:59:18] better yeah I'm good on RZ
[03:59:24] too uh I think for future artifacts when
[03:59:27] we roll I will ban Z Jeff from the chat
[03:59:30] for obvious
[03:59:31] reasons the luck is contagious but not
[03:59:35] bad good ciret good ciret for a good
[03:59:39] genin player that's me let's go conar
[03:59:41] resin uh Abyss 83 don't talk about
[03:59:50] it why did someone say why freeto playay
[03:59:53] artifact better than your whale artifact
[03:59:56] bro what are you yapping about look at
[03:59:58] my same one says well look at
[04:00:02] it
[04:00:07] sorry
[04:00:18] check
[04:00:27] DMS what do you think of my first anemo
[04:00:29] goblet why the [ __ ] is this on farizon
[04:00:32] little
[04:00:37] bro
[04:00:40] this is like a fav piece but on
[04:00:41] Vermilion could you imagine if you
[04:00:43] farmed a useful
[04:00:45] domain could you imagine if you farmed
[04:00:47] milth well that's not really a useful
[04:00:49] domain but you got have strong box it
[04:00:50] can you imagine if you farmed [ __ ]
[04:00:53] emblem wow emblem farizon okay that's
[04:00:57] kind of cope farzon doesn't really have
[04:00:58] a good domain that's six rolls dude who
[04:01:01] is
[04:01:04] counting every course of action has its
[04:01:07] risks
[04:01:08] [Music]
[04:01:10] nice five piece okay whale okay dude I
[04:01:14] it's it is better than the sad part you
[04:01:17] guys want to know the sad part I'm
[04:01:19] pretty sure it's better than my best
[04:01:22] anemo goblet on on set it's literally
[04:01:24] yeah it's really like as good 13 uh crit
[04:01:28] raate with nine ER and this one has 10
[04:01:30] Critter raate with 15
[04:01:33] ER like how much dude can you okay I
[04:01:36] have probably spent more resin than
[04:01:39] anyone who has a good anemo goblet on
[04:01:41] Vermillion probably all of them combined
[04:01:43] and this is my best one it's
[04:01:47] okay child I don't need ER okay I don't
[04:01:50] need I never say listen I might have
[04:01:54] said that but don't quote me on things
[04:01:55] that I say I typically say with just C1
[04:01:59] sh arguably c0 I don't actually need ER
[04:02:02] cuz I have Shan Yun and I have farzon C6
[04:02:05] on fav so even if my sh had no
[04:02:07] constellations I would be fine
[04:02:08] especially with
[04:02:14] C1 dude ER is literally propaganda from
[04:02:18] Big energy I'm sorry yes you C1 is not
[04:02:21] fake here's why okay C1 sucks for the
[04:02:23] first two years of the game but guess
[04:02:25] what if you're still playing Shia in
[04:02:27] 2024 your high investment you're
[04:02:29] clearing in one or two rotations
[04:02:31] everything [ __ ] dies your e actually
[04:02:33] matters cuz it does like 100 [ __ ] k
[04:02:34] no it does it like 60 so it actually
[04:02:37] it's it's it's energy recharge is
[04:02:39] propaganda because if you play the game
[04:02:42] a lot you kill [ __ ] fast because you're
[04:02:43] high invest like eventually you get high
[04:02:45] investment it might not be for a month
[04:02:46] it might not be for a year but
[04:02:48] eventually you kill everything so you
[04:02:50] get more energy with someone like sh cuz
[04:02:52] you're [ __ ] plunging every enemy at
[04:02:53] the time you're killing them all you
[04:02:55] clear in literally two rotations all the
[04:02:57] [ __ ] time and you have batteries on
[04:02:59] your team so why would you build energy
[04:03:01] when you can just kill
[04:03:07] everything
[04:03:17] like you got me [ __ ] up if you think
[04:03:19] I'm building energy recharge on Nita
[04:03:21] I've had the same Nita build uh except I
[04:03:23] changed my circl recently but I've
[04:03:26] usually had the same Nikita build for
[04:03:28] like two years or since she came out a
[04:03:31] year and a half oh no not two years yeah
[04:03:33] almost two years a year and a half I
[04:03:35] don't know how much ER she has I can't
[04:03:38] can't even tell you it's it's a blind
[04:03:39] guess
[04:03:41] 115 okay well this build's kind of cope
[04:03:43] I I usually have it doesn't matter I'm
[04:03:45] usually on whith I think um for I don't
[04:03:48] know don't talk to me but my point is I
[04:03:50] don't
[04:03:52] know oh no I have y's weapon that's why
[04:03:55] well no that's not even true cuz I
[04:03:56] didn't use it on her I don't know maybe
[04:03:57] I wasn't with it I wasn't listening can
[04:03:59] you say that again no I don't even know
[04:04:00] what I
[04:04:01] said energy is good sometimes I just
[04:04:04] wish the the only thing sometimes I wish
[04:04:06] I wasn't a guide maker look don't get me
[04:04:08] wrong I love it but like I sometimes I
[04:04:10] wish I could just like feel like be like
[04:04:12] you know what I don't feel like I need
[04:04:15] energy and then just like start
[04:04:17] yapping the world come I I envy that
[04:04:21] life Envy
[04:04:26] sorry make the you already do that yeah
[04:04:29] but I don't recommend it to people like
[04:04:32] I don't
[04:04:34] dude cuz I have a different reaction
[04:04:36] than most normal humans when I run out
[04:04:39] of energy I'm like damn I must have
[04:04:41] [ __ ] something up I'm never like I
[04:04:42] need more
[04:04:45] ER that's just my reaction to the
[04:05:00] wicked so building ER is a skill issue
[04:05:03] true cuz the more skill you have the
[04:05:06] faster you clear therefore the less
[04:05:07] energy you need cuz enemies give
[04:05:09] particles true or
[04:05:11] Noto is this good
[04:05:15] ever I mean albo
[04:05:22] but good on
[04:05:26] japar uh this could be good cuz attack
[04:05:29] and crit damage on the set is actually
[04:05:30] really good this could actually be
[04:05:32] corent we'll level this like
[04:05:36] yeah
[04:05:42] we'll level it we'll level it
[04:05:46] now chat what if I turn this volume up
[04:05:49] to a obnoxious
[04:05:54] degree maybe it'll bless our
[04:06:03] peace [ __ ] it's not even that bad

[04:22:04] than I don't I a lot of coffee are just
[04:22:07] like kind of whatever so like that
[04:22:09] aren't like from
[04:22:12] a like I don't want to say certified I
[04:22:14] don't know what the word
[04:22:16] is I don't know good
[04:22:24] source me
[04:22:28] with seems like an
[04:22:31] emergency with or without trigger
[04:22:33] because if it's without trigger dot dot
[04:22:34] dot I I actually I'm I'm a I'm a psych I
[04:22:38] have it without suggar but that's cuz my
[04:22:40] grandma I don't know I just have when my
[04:22:43] Grandma makes it she puts it like a
[04:22:44] little thing and then I take it like I
[04:22:45] chug
[04:22:46] it no way yeah it like [ __ ] wires you
[04:22:49] I haven't look I've never I have not
[04:22:51] done hard drugs but I assume that's what
[04:22:53] cocaine is like they like you're fully
[04:22:59] wired in game in
[04:23:05] game yeah
[04:23:11] sorry
[04:23:16] hard
[04:23:24] sorry I don't like sweet I like okay I
[04:23:28] don't really like sweet coffee that much
[04:23:30] I like adding cream or milk to like
[04:23:34] lessen it especially if it's like very
[04:23:36] harsh and dark roasted and super bitter
[04:23:39] but I don't like adding sugar like I I
[04:23:42] like I don't know like I kind of like
[04:23:43] the
[04:23:48] bitterness
[04:23:54] Purge although I don't think it tastes
[04:23:56] better without it it's just like
[04:23:57] diminishing
[04:24:01] returns like it's diminishing return
[04:24:03] it's like it's like it might make it
[04:24:05] like slightly better but you need have a
[04:24:06] [ __ ] ton of sugar and you don't feel
[04:24:07] like you're healthy anymore and then
[04:24:09] it's like okay well now I'm drinking
[04:24:10] like a milkshake and then it's like okay
[04:24:12] well ah like then it takes more effort
[04:24:14] to make it it's like 30 minutes and then
[04:24:16] it's like the percentage increase from
[04:24:18] sugar to no sugar versus having it to
[04:24:20] not having it is like a it's it's you
[04:24:22] know it's not that
[04:24:28] high stop using G turns for iral things
[04:24:32] you know there's a 3 second ICD on dirt
[04:24:34] application which is why when you drop
[04:24:36] of food there's a 3C rule it's so
[04:24:38] there's not no dirt on it there's a
[04:24:40] little bit when you drop it right
[04:24:42] there's a little bit cuz it's the first
[04:24:43] Elemental application but then there's a
[04:24:45] 3 second internal cool down between when
[04:24:47] the food touches the ground and then 3
[04:24:50] seconds after it'll apply dirt again so
[04:24:52] that's why the 3C rule it isn't perfect
[04:24:55] because there will be some dirt on it
[04:24:56] cuz when it drops there's anal
[04:24:58] application but the for 3 seconds there
[04:25:00] won't be another one because there's a 3
[04:25:02] second ICD uh so that's why the 3sec
[04:25:05] rule exists
[04:25:07] yeah it applies one U of
[04:25:18] dirt doesn't depend on
[04:25:21] ping yeah unfortunately if you're high
[04:25:23] ping IRL if you're high ping and it
[04:25:26] takes you too long to get it uh you
[04:25:28] might it might have more dirt on

[04:35:05] taking a turn for the better please put
[04:35:08] a space between God and Ming when you
[04:35:10] type in chat so I don't read it as
[04:35:12] gaming to the wicked I don't hate gaming
[04:35:15] and I also don't hate
[04:35:30] ging strike a
[04:35:34] pose
[04:35:37] Z is in chat can he vouch for you that
[04:35:40] you didn't see he probably
[04:35:45] can uh wow this is
[04:35:48] terrible you think I could auction this
[04:35:50] piece
[04:36:00] off Chad think of your happiest moment
[04:36:03] actually okay I don't know why I'm
[04:36:04] bringing this up right I'm okay my point
[04:36:06] was just okay my point listen my point
[04:36:11] my point was like
[04:36:13] listen you I okay I'm going to be
[04:36:17] honest there are very few things in this
[04:36:21] world that
[04:36:24] I wouldn't
[04:36:29] trade for a 50 crit value
[04:36:32] artifact if I'm being honest and you ask
[04:36:36] me I won't use the same one piece let me
[04:36:37] use another
[04:36:38] piece if you ask me
[04:36:42] Z ZX what do you value
[04:36:48] more your
[04:36:50] friends Us in
[04:36:54] chat your
[04:36:57] grades or your artifacts which would you
[04:37:01] rather have you can only save one one of
[04:37:04] them oh fall they both fall off the
[04:37:07] boat your friend and an artifact [ __ ]
[04:37:11] what do you
[04:37:15] save
[04:37:18] now naturally I would pick my friend I
[04:37:21] would pick you in
[04:37:24] chat but I would have to think about it
[04:37:26] a bit and it would hurt and that's the
[04:37:27] point because you can always make a new
[04:37:32] friend but you can't okay you you can't
[04:37:36] listen this isn't going I didn't plan
[04:37:38] where the end of the sentence was going
[04:37:40] to go let me rephrase this there's a lot
[04:37:43] of

[05:15:09] strangling what the [ __ ] is happening
[05:15:11] here R15 wait are you a whale or are you

[05:15:18] make fun of you wait you just don't care
[05:15:19] about your ca so I'm going to assume
[05:15:22] that you have a high amount of crit rate
[05:15:25] because you're on R15 so when I click
[05:15:30] details
[05:15:34] let's take a moment to rest and plan our

[05:16:34] should prepare while we can pretty good
[05:16:36] then make a preemptive strike against
[05:16:38] the enemy crit HP those are the stats
[05:16:40] you're looking for ciret hp% I actually
[05:16:43] like this I think hp% circlets on emblem
[05:16:46] like if you're farming embl for like 15
[05:16:48] characters and you also need a crit
[05:16:49] circlet for yolan it hurts but if you
[05:16:51] can just give her your like bonus HP one

[05:16:54] nice good uh uh uh uh uh uh

[05:19:53] appreciate how beautiful it is he
[05:19:59] you how much ER is recommended for Yan
[05:20:01] thanks so much for asking it actually
[05:20:02] depends very heavily on your team you
[05:20:04] can need 180 to 200 sometimes you can
[05:20:06] need that's like a general range but a
[05:20:08] lot of teams might run double Hydro or
[05:20:09] like Ryden or something then you would
[05:20:11] need less especially with like fonia
[05:20:12] supports you might need around 160 to
[05:20:14] 180 uh it either 160 to 180 or 180 to
[05:20:17] 200 or 200 to like 24 I don't really
[05:20:19] like saying 240 but 220 240 uh depending
[05:20:22] on your team General range you want to
[05:20:23] be cool you want to be safe you want to
[05:20:24] be calm you want to be collected I'd say
[05:20:26] 200ish maybe 220 maybe 180 that it
[05:20:29] varies uh I don't like answers like that
[05:20:31] because it it depends but it
[05:20:36] depends wow what what does Zach in his

[05:29:34] off with
[05:29:37] uh you know a little bit of gench and
[05:29:40] spiciness it is what it is you
[05:29:43] know I'm going to say there's a decent
[05:29:46] chance that this year is going to be a
[05:29:49] lot of people complaining because
[05:29:51] there's a de like so star ra for their
[05:29:54] adversity they're probably going to give
[05:29:55] you a car or something like everyone's
[05:29:57] going to get like a [ __ ] Tesla or
[05:29:58] some [ __ ] I don't know you're probably
[05:29:59] going to get like you could choose a
[05:30:00] limited five star and like [ __ ] take
[05:30:02] their clothes off I don't know if
[05:30:05] they're of legal age there's going to be
[05:30:06] something you're going to get a [ __ ]
[05:30:08] weapon you choose your five star weapon
[05:30:09] you can get a standard ban it's going to
[05:30:11] be something and then that's going to
[05:30:12] cause like and then after that uh well
[05:30:15] let's just say uh let's just say there's
[05:30:18] a high
[05:30:21] likelihood let's just say there's a high
[05:30:24] likelihood
[05:30:26] um okay I'm going to say something I
[05:30:29] think Fontana is great I love
[05:30:32] F I think genin Designs Great regions
[05:30:36] I'm just going to say there's a high
[05:30:39] likelihood
[05:30:40] that uh not land is I hope it is great
[05:30:46] and what we expect there's a high
[05:30:49] likelihood that you
[05:30:51] know
[05:30:54] look I I I I expectations are are are
[05:30:59] low
[05:31:04] hopefully hopefully I'm surprised
[05:31:11] pleasantly why no I'm not saying it's
[05:31:13] going to be bad probably won't be
[05:31:17] bad why are you doom posting oh yeah so
[05:31:20] if I criticize I'm doom posting I'm
[05:31:23] saying I am
[05:31:27] worried of uh uh uh
[05:31:31] uh uh certain character designs but
[05:31:35] hopefully they do it justice I don't
[05:31:38] know uh I'm just saying there's no
[05:31:40] reason for me
[05:31:42] to I mean I don't know we'll see we'll
[05:31:46] see
[05:31:47] hopefully so you did li de I
[05:31:52] don't okay actually this is before I see

[05:45:27] down
[05:45:38] I see everything make yourself a
[05:45:43] mo come on we can do it just like we
[05:45:48] rehear
[05:45:50] all gr gr
[05:45:54] grow that that was
[05:45:57] easy oh [ __ ] full ass Soo Team all
[05:45:59] right will take
[05:46:01] Soo okay I probably shouldn't take Soo
[05:46:04] but we're going to take
[05:46:06] Soo and
[05:46:11] yon actually official I have an idea
[05:46:14] watch
[05:46:27] this watch
[05:46:30] this Sino official
[05:46:36] nahita
[05:46:39] Neu let him cook let him cook let him
[05:46:43] cook
[05:46:46] everyone let him
[05:46:50] cook wi nowhere to run
[05:46:55] your your is Du
[05:46:59] okay and now we have to swap off sideo I
[05:47:01] see everything that's cool
[05:47:03] though
[05:47:09] for As You Wish dude I'm so sad though
[05:47:12] that okay I think I made the wrong
[05:47:14] decision in the Nita guide where I said
[05:47:17] one word wrong it's fine it's not a big
[05:47:18] deal but I trimmed the word out so now
[05:47:20] the editing sounds dog [ __ ] but I
[05:47:22] probably should have just left it and
[05:47:23] then just been like yo like that was the
[05:47:24] wrong word cuz I said skill instead of
[05:47:26] burst like it's not a big deal but I was
[05:47:28] like I'll just trim it out but it sounds
[05:47:30] disgusting now so I don't know if that
[05:47:32] was the correct decision I feel like it
[05:47:34] wasn't I was confused yeah my my logic
[05:47:37] was people that are confused would check
[05:47:39] the comments so they know like it's less
[05:47:42] likely that people like it's more likely
[05:47:45] that if you're confused you check the
[05:47:46] comment so you understand then if I
[05:47:48] leave the wrong word you might not check
[05:47:50] the comment does it matter if I say
[05:47:52] extends your skill instead of extend
[05:47:53] your Burst when both of them would be
[05:47:54] dog [ __ ] anyways not really but I still
[05:47:56] don't want to risk spreading the wrong
[05:47:58] info so I changed it I kind of reget
[05:48:00] like not regret it but probably wasn't
[05:48:02] optimal but is what it is we're going
[05:48:03] play H them witho cuz I don't
[05:48:07] care it was like the morally correct
[05:48:09] thing to do but I feel like it makes the
[05:48:11] video less enjoyable to watch I mean
[05:48:13] it's just one edit it's not or like two
[05:48:15] edit it's not a big deal but like I
[05:48:17] don't
[05:48:21] know WIS of Darkness I didn't notice
[05:48:25] like it's not a big it's not huge but
[05:48:27] it's like I should have eat what the
[05:48:28] [ __ ] is my
[05:48:30] rotation I think with double carry you
[05:48:32] have to Al height them e plunge and then
[05:48:42] burst no the burst duration increase of
[05:48:45] hydro is like incredibly like it's like
[05:48:48] cool you get a bit more e like em buff
[05:48:52] for like your Neo team but like
[05:48:54] 99.999% of the time you're just using
[05:48:56] your your burst once per rotation you're
[05:48:58] not like waiting for it to like to
[05:49:00] expire you just use it when it's like
[05:49:02] each rotation you swap to theer you e
[05:49:04] and then you burst or burst and then e
[05:49:06] or whatever but
[05:49:10] yeah ins is necessary yeah but it
[05:49:13] doesn't change your Gameplay at all it
[05:49:14] just extends the duration that's it and
[05:49:17] Sino
[05:49:19] teams I mean
[05:49:23] yeah your journey ends your journey ends
[05:49:27] here
[05:49:29] taking a turn for the
[05:49:33] betterin your
[05:49:35] journey jice
[05:49:41] sered why am I cutting it
[05:49:47] close yo I'm not going to get it I got
[05:49:51] it okay I making this look harder than
[05:49:53] it is cuz I'm running terrible teams
[05:49:55] okay uh so I understand I I get
[05:50:06] okay should I play plunge Alam I don't

[05:57:34] uh earlier in the Stream you said the
[05:57:36] trial farizon in the event is C5 laau
[05:57:40] and so the thing about this event right
[05:57:43] is it mimics your constellations so if I
[05:57:45] check farzon for me it's C6 which means
[05:57:48] not only are you cooked for the event
[05:57:51] but your Faron is also cooked for your
[05:57:53] account so can I get a rib Boo in the

[05:59:34] no way you just ask me who's better
[05:59:35] Singo or
[05:59:37] yolon uh for a plunger I like one of the
[05:59:41] two shoots faster after a normal I'm
[05:59:42] pretty sure it's yolan so I usually like
[05:59:44] that character especially with like Shia
[05:59:46] I assume guming too uh well it depends
[05:59:48] on how much Hydra you need with guming
[05:59:50] but it Z Jeff will tell you sing Cho I
[05:59:54] will say yolan because I like that it's
[05:59:55] faster on a punch so you don't actually
[05:59:56] have to normal attack as much you can
[05:59:59] like kind of cancel it
[06:00:01] faster I can show you what I mean cuz
[06:00:03] it's been a while since I like tried it
[06:00:05] but yeah it should go out
[06:00:07] faster with um
[06:00:20] yon but usually
[06:00:25] um s show is a comfier unit
[06:00:32] in I'm not stop giving me in general
[06:00:34] statements for SRO versus yolan we're
[06:00:36] not opening that can of worms today I'm

[06:13:11] in something chat life is more fun when
[06:13:13] you believe in something okay let's look
[06:13:16] at these artifacts let's look at these
[06:13:18] artifacts we'll start with DEA uh we got
[06:13:25] a
[06:13:27] St CLE level 90 solar Pearl R3 uh on
[06:13:30] two-piece reminescence two-piece Crimson
[06:13:32] witch 8160 nice one to2 ratio low em but
[06:13:36] probably not on a like vaping or
[06:13:38] anything uh 2K
[06:13:40] attack triple crowned
[06:13:42] CLE uh not you know pretty good wait
[06:13:45] Triple Crown Shena as well uh concerning
[06:13:48] fav Lance no sorry Calamity quer two
[06:13:51] blizzard Strayer two glad uh on a 1 to2
[06:13:54] crit ratio for some reason building a
[06:13:56] crit chanha um honestly kind of based
[06:14:01] attack is obviously better but it looks
[06:14:03] like they're playing a DPS chanha which
[06:14:05] I respect more achievements than
[06:14:15] you Nita sack frags level 90 R1 but it's
[06:14:20] fine um you got 940 em some crit as well
[06:14:23] this is a pretty good Nita uh just a lot
[06:14:26] of em 23 here 21 there that's not great
[06:14:29] but at least there's some crit stats 74
[06:14:31] flat defense rip Bozo uh let's look at
[06:14:33] the Kaza a lot of er two kabo signatures
[06:14:36] okay 172 ER 900 em actually pretty good
[06:14:39] you should level your level one
[06:14:42] normals that is a red flag please don't
[06:14:44] keep your kazas normals at level one
[06:14:47] they are very important about as
[06:14:49] important as your skill because the
[06:14:50] plunge damage scales on your uh normal
[06:14:52] attacks Talent the plunge counts weight
[06:14:55] AC actually wait why are there people in
[06:14:57] chat that yes level your normals it does
[06:15:00] about as much damage as your like you
[06:15:02] skill damage and then you plunge damage
[06:15:04] and the plunge skills in your
[06:15:07] normal chat you want to level
[06:15:09] this wait really yo how do you guys not
[06:15:13] know this like I would understand I'm

[06:23:53] can do emblem you can do four no blast
[06:23:55] you know it depends what you want you

[06:24:21] good flower that is okay the EM is nice
[06:24:25] you have no crit uh Nito wants G but she

[06:25:30] her on field cuz you're running clam
[06:25:31] clam is like okay if you're not on field
[06:25:33] but if you're off field I would
