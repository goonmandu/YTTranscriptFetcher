[00:13:15] gonna actually look at you when I say
[00:13:16] this listen here young man or woman the
[00:13:19] reason why the account review isn't
[00:13:21] happening right now is because the
[00:13:24] people that I have editing
[00:13:26] certain videos are still in the process
[00:13:28] of editing them so I don't want to do
[00:13:30] the review and then just it's just
[00:13:32] sitting there so I'm gonna do it once it
[00:13:34] once it an editor is available for
[00:13:37] college midterm but now that you are
[00:13:39] streaming I have to watch you

[00:29:43] why wouldn't we so uh other than just
[00:29:46] that though there's a few other things I
[00:29:47] want to do maybe we'll play our Free
[00:29:49] Play account maybe I'll explore but I
[00:29:51] also need to get the newest uh
[00:29:52] achievement thing that came out the one
[00:29:54] that I actually do every time which is
[00:29:55] the uh Challenge Series uh uh and we're
[00:29:59] gonna finish it all we're gonna get the
[00:30:00] same card and also let me

[00:30:16] I don't remember oh yeah I kind of want
[00:30:18] to stretch off today's Isaiah I might
[00:30:20] make this into like a YouTube series but
[00:30:22] it'll probably be on the second Channel
[00:30:23] because I don't think it's good enough
[00:30:24] to be on the main Channel until unless I
[00:30:26] get like an idea of how to make it a
[00:30:28] domain Channel video like maybe like
[00:30:29] when we finish it we like recap it
[00:30:31] however
[00:30:32] I low-key might unironically get a
[00:30:35] thousand achievements which is like a
[00:30:37] lot of content so we might do that a lot
[00:30:39] of them are boring as [ __ ] though like
[00:30:40] if you're doing this for fun you're just
[00:30:42] weird like a lot of these are just weird
[00:30:44] a lot of these are just weird but like
[00:30:45] it is what it is we might we might get
[00:30:47] them all I have to do all the co-op ones
[00:30:48] too might have to come up with you guys
[00:30:50] and I I [ __ ] hey I hey I hate you guys
[00:30:54] but we might have to co-op it is what it
[00:30:55] is uh it is what it is we might have to
[00:30:57] co-op
[00:30:58] um and I'll do all these but yeah

[00:31:11] gonna deal with just two

[00:35:43] weapon level that's like level [ __ ]
[00:35:45] like
[00:35:46] 10 to 12 but it's not dude
[00:35:49] yeah that's barely a level
[00:35:51] when you get higher IVs at so donated
[00:35:54] one dollar someday you like me I be live
[00:35:57] in you
[00:35:58] what
[00:36:14] someone redeemed goblet Flags
[00:36:17] yeah but why would I do that to you guys
[00:36:20] dude I'm not trying to make there's no
[00:36:22] reason flexing what I have I'm not that
[00:36:26] type of person I'm not
[00:36:31] I'm not gonna Flex my hydro goblets it's
[00:36:35] just weird
[00:36:39] okay
[00:36:42] 1554.
[00:36:46] okay these aren't even knocking okay
[00:36:47] this one's pretty good but
[00:36:49] not even that much of a flex
[00:36:52] I don't even know what my best goblet I
[00:36:53] guess my hydro ones are pretty good mind
[00:36:55] if that one's pretty good uh he has a
[00:36:57] better one that's on ayato right now
[00:36:59] I mean these are pretty good that I'm
[00:37:01] not using yeah this is probably my
[00:37:02] better one but it's on ayato
[00:37:05] I don't have a perfect do I have a
[00:37:07] perfect goblet that's like only good
[00:37:08] stats I actually don't know I guess
[00:37:10] Chows but Xiao has a few low rolls
[00:37:12] xiao's like my OG shout is perfect if
[00:37:14] you need to be stupid because like yeah
[00:37:16] yeah I'm just wasted but like all the
[00:37:17] rolls were good it just had a bit of low
[00:37:18] rolls like medium rolls but overall I
[00:37:20] was like I got this when it was AR like
[00:37:21] 45. so like back in the day this was
[00:37:24] like I didn't understand like this was
[00:37:26] like
[00:37:27] the best goblet that anyone had ever
[00:37:29] seen but now it's just like pretty good
[00:37:31] but it's no longer onset for him but
[00:37:34] I don't know I don't know if I have like
[00:37:35] an actual perfect one I don't think so
[00:37:39] like I don't think there's one with like
[00:37:40] four good sub stats that only rolls good
[00:37:44] um
[00:37:46] this one's really good but obviously the
[00:37:48] flat stats aren't
[00:37:50] trying to see
[00:37:57] this one's pretty cracked I can't lie
[00:38:04] this is also really good this one's
[00:38:07] insane it rolled flat HP but it's insane
[00:38:09] because it's on it was on set for facial
[00:38:11] and then they they [ __ ] gave her
[00:38:13] another no calm down they gave her
[00:38:15] another set so this isn't even onset
[00:38:17] anymore and they just added golden troop
[00:38:19] for no [ __ ] reason so Vermillion went
[00:38:21] from oh flexible set to no one can use
[00:38:23] it but it's all good it is what it is it
[00:38:25] is what it is uh it is what it is I'm
[00:38:28] sure golden troop won't even be good
[00:38:29] next patch because they're gonna make a
[00:38:31] new [ __ ] official set why not
[00:38:32] uh my husk sets my hus goblets are
[00:38:36] surprisingly good because keep in mind
[00:38:38] I've probably spent 5 000 resin total in
[00:38:41] husk 5 000 total in husk and I have
[00:38:46] these two I don't even have a similar
[00:38:48] Vermillion Animo goblet and I've spent
[00:38:50] 150k or no at least 100 I don't know
[00:38:52] exactly how much but at least 100K like
[00:38:54] 120k or something
[00:38:59] okay
[00:39:01] that's what it is
[00:39:03] anyways no more Goblin flexing I'm sorry
[00:39:18] oh my God now via goblets
[00:39:31] susk

[00:46:12] streamers
[00:46:15] I love ziox on Twitch okay I am not
[00:46:20] ready Matt
[00:46:25] what are the main factors oh endgame
[00:46:27] endgame end game end game end game Co-op
[00:46:29] Co-op I can play with my friend I can me
[00:46:32] and my friends we can hold hands that's
[00:46:33] what I want
[00:46:34] uh multiplayer mode
[00:46:37] um a challenge
[00:46:40] raids challenges uh uh bosses to fight
[00:46:45] hard
[00:46:48] getting
[00:46:50] hard challenges with friends
[00:46:56] Graphics in-game benefits
[00:47:01] if you choose I don't need to invest too
[00:47:03] much time in the game not to be dramatic
[00:47:05] but you are what's wrong with Genji's
[00:47:08] future updates the devs are seeing that
[00:47:10] they're like oh oh okay no more Abyss
[00:47:12] floors no more content
[00:47:16] I'm sorry
[00:47:18] I'm sorry
[00:47:19] I just joined leave
[00:47:30] how do you first hear against an impact
[00:47:32] uh YouTube
[00:47:34] how did I hear
[00:47:37] I don't know
[00:47:40] I had a friend whose friend worked on
[00:47:43] genjin so they were like yo you should
[00:47:44] try this game
[00:47:54] from the draft I told the Jeff to play
[00:47:56] he was a league addict I I told him to
[00:47:59] play
[00:48:02] he literally when I told him to play he
[00:48:05] was like
[00:48:06] he was like
[00:48:07] I'll try it but I'm addicted to league
[00:48:09] right now so I probably won't play and
[00:48:11] now look at him
[00:48:12] worst friend
[00:48:17] uh main factors genuinely the characters
[00:48:21] okay I'm not kidding you might think I'm
[00:48:24] making this up the two things that made
[00:48:25] me play were one I checked if it was
[00:48:28] Co-op and I was like oh and like if I
[00:48:30] could do like co-op with my friends then
[00:48:32] I checked the characters and and when I
[00:48:34] saw Co-op I saw like the domains that
[00:48:36] people were doing you know that like you
[00:48:37] know the story domain you do like the
[00:48:39] one you have to do with Amber where
[00:48:40] you're like exploring through this
[00:48:41] domain and there's like [ __ ] you have to
[00:48:43] fight I thought I could Replay that and
[00:48:45] like Co-op it and it would be like end
[00:48:47] game like that I thought like the end
[00:48:48] game would be like domains like that but
[00:48:50] harder and with your friends and I was
[00:48:51] like dude that looks sick I the first
[00:48:53] day I played I stayed up all night to
[00:48:54] get AR-16 to unlock Co-op I unlocked
[00:48:57] Co-op I went to bed never touched it
[00:48:59] again
[00:49:01] uh but I also looked at the characters
[00:49:04] before I started because that's what
[00:49:05] gets me in games I saw the characters I
[00:49:07] liked I saw deluke Fishel and ciao I was
[00:49:09] like they look sick and then I started
[00:49:11] playing and I wanted all three of them
[00:49:13] and I wanted officials so bad that I
[00:49:14] pulled on the first venti banner I
[00:49:16] didn't even want venti initially I knew
[00:49:18] he was broken because I saw a bunch of
[00:49:19] [ __ ] I was like I kind of want official
[00:49:20] and I got like four Barbers five
[00:49:22] shanglings and no official and then I
[00:49:24] got venti and then I got official
[00:49:27] I'll stop I'm gonna stop using that I'm
[00:49:28] sorry okay Co-op and then
[00:49:31] uh uh characters
[00:49:34] friends
[00:49:36] uh end the game
[00:49:40] one of the most enjoyable aspects
[00:49:42] thank you I like the stories I like the
[00:49:45] stories I like I don't like Abyss I
[00:49:47] listen common misconception that endgame
[00:49:50] players like Abyss no I [ __ ] hate the
[00:49:52] abyss Abyss can suck my entire balls
[00:49:54] however I like challenging content
[00:49:57] unfortunately all we have is the abyss
[00:49:58] it should be better there should be
[00:50:00] other hard content that's not the abyss
[00:50:02] but it is what it is there have been
[00:50:03] events that are more fun than the abyss
[00:50:05] but it is what it is but for now we'll
[00:50:07] click that we click story quests I don't
[00:50:09] like World quests I like story quests
[00:50:10] RNR requests are a line was really good
[00:50:12] but it was long and not voice acted so I
[00:50:16] probably wouldn't have played it if I
[00:50:17] wasn't a streamer but because I played
[00:50:18] it I actually liked it
[00:50:21] um
[00:50:22] wait this one wait what's the difference
[00:50:23] between oh characters now [ __ ] that
[00:50:26] I like this one uh I mean I guess some
[00:50:29] of them are cool I like the well the
[00:50:30] shot one was an archon Quest okay never
[00:50:32] mind
[00:50:34] I mean sure I'll still click it
[00:50:39] character Quest can be good yes but
[00:50:41] sometimes it can be bad
[00:50:42] like they can either they can be good or
[00:50:44] they can ruin the character for you
[00:50:46] because then it's just bad writing
[00:51:01] what is your main long-term goal oh [ __ ]
[00:51:04] Advance the main plot line
[00:51:08] okay obtain event rewards how's that a
[00:51:11] long-term goal that is
[00:51:13] sure
[00:51:15] friendship okay
[00:51:19] characters
[00:51:22] select up to three okay uh we'll do May
[00:51:25] we'll do okay first of all we'll do
[00:51:27] level up my character stats we'll do
[00:51:29] more Abyss Stars I will do
[00:51:33] line isn't a goal you just do it no
[00:51:35] one's like yes I completed the plot line

[00:54:58] where I'm gonna list this but let's say
[00:54:59] hard
[00:55:00] Co-op and game content
[00:55:02] now you might be thinking
[00:55:05] why would you do this
[00:55:09] most of our player base
[00:55:12] won't care
[00:55:15] well that is where you are wrong
[00:55:19] let me explain
[00:55:21] one
[00:55:23] you can put it as a uh uh it it will be
[00:55:29] an optional
[00:55:30] pop up
[00:55:33] after well actually no no it'll be
[00:55:35] scalable difficulties that's what it's
[00:55:37] gonna be that's what it's gonna be I
[00:55:38] [ __ ] I'm a genius no no scalable
[00:55:42] difficulty cooperating content listen
[00:55:44] one
[00:55:46] scales in difficulty so anyone can try
[00:55:49] and do it
[00:55:51] two rewards that make players feel
[00:55:56] happy and accomplished
[00:56:01] player a

[00:56:21] cool
[00:56:22] boom suddenly players want to play and
[00:56:27] have a reason to get out of bed in the
[00:56:30] morning
[00:56:31] they are addicted
[00:56:33] three
[00:56:35] three
[00:56:38] since it is Co-op
[00:56:41] new players joined the game friends make
[00:56:46] them play
[00:56:47] then they get addicted gotcha spend all
[00:56:51] their money
[00:56:52] win-win
[00:56:54] I'm talking in company terms here don't
[00:56:55] worry four
[00:56:58] it is
[00:56:59] game
[00:57:02] MMO players
[00:57:04] are playing whatever Dead game they are
[00:57:07] currently on can swap to this one and
[00:57:11] also lose all their money
[00:57:17] can join it on the fun
[00:57:28] five
[00:57:29] friends
[00:57:31] the fear of missing out
[00:57:34] from your friends all holding hands
[00:57:37] touching tips fighting against hard and
[00:57:41] cool and fun content getting great
[00:57:45] rewards

[00:57:53] what the heck
[00:57:55] I want to make
[00:57:58] money
[00:58:00] I am a company why would I care about
[00:58:03] this
[00:58:05] glad you asked
[00:58:08] since players will be playing
[00:58:12] and
[00:58:14] it is
[00:58:15] accessible to all but also challenging
[00:58:19] and Co-op players won't realize that
[00:58:24] they can just use Shang Ling meta is
[00:58:27] boring
[00:58:29] have you met a girl okay that was that
[00:58:33] is boring they will feel inclined
[00:58:37] to get
[00:58:40] limited 5 Star characters and weapons
[00:58:44] spending Primo gems and money
[00:58:48] furthermore so Jeff they will read this
[00:58:50] by the way furthermore
[00:58:53] you don't you
[00:58:56] many Primo gems
[00:58:58] as Rewards
[00:59:02] weapons
[00:59:04] skins name cards pets untradable
[00:59:09] Cosmetics that make players happy are
[00:59:12] things that they will chase for days
[00:59:15] weeks months years eons decades
[00:59:25] if that wasn't enough
[00:59:27] add some dumb surrender teapot Farmville
[00:59:34] Minecraft [ __ ] for the other players
[00:59:38] XD
[00:59:45] wow a new fishing rod
[00:59:47] wow an extra friendship Quest because I
[00:59:54] love lore
[00:59:55] wow are the fatoui chess pieces ha oh my
[01:00:00] God haha who is Capitano okay
[01:00:05] so that is that is one thing now I
[01:00:07] know that is one thing right
[01:00:10] and everyone will have fun all people
[01:00:15] will be uh uh uh uh and I'll be able to
[01:00:21] play with my friends I have some
[01:00:25] I know genshin
[01:00:28] was designed for hey what if I have no
[01:00:32] friends and want to see uh
[01:00:36] character that makes me happy
[01:00:39] but you can just make it solo
[01:00:44] a bull or add a friend finder Co-op okay
[01:00:52] aware isn't that true though isn't that
[01:00:54] why they designed it I don't know I
[01:00:55] don't know the lore but I'm pretty sure
[01:00:56] there's like
[01:00:57] yeah it is
[01:01:01] anyways
[01:01:02] so that's
[01:01:04] um that's first part now I'm Gonna Leave
[01:01:06] This at the end because they might not
[01:01:07] read that right
[01:01:08] well but that was Point like like six or
[01:01:10] something point one will be uh uh uh
[01:01:13] actually that'll be point one no they
[01:01:15] won't read it
[01:01:21] we'll start with yeah we'll start with
[01:01:22] it we'll start with it
[01:01:27] other changes
[01:01:32] epitomize path for standard Banner it's
[01:01:34] profitable actually not bad
[01:01:36] you know what that's the first smart
[01:01:38] thing I ever heard you say big F first
[01:01:41] first first good comment from Ahmad
[01:01:44] first first good comment
[01:01:48] epitomized
[01:01:51] path for standard Banner more
[01:01:55] more pulls more money
[01:01:58] new standard Banner characters and
[01:02:01] weapons from old reruns that you don't
[01:02:04] want to do anymore because who is going
[01:02:08] to pull
[01:02:09] for CLI or Eula in 2024 be serious
[01:02:15] and they uh tanari weapons
[01:02:19] three
[01:02:24] um
[01:02:26] ryden's Elemental burst should and
[01:02:31] needs to work with Betos
[01:02:34] please I will do anything
[01:02:43] Deus
[01:02:46] everyone please watch
[01:02:48] also work with I'm just gonna leave it
[01:02:52] blank because you could literally fill
[01:02:54] anything in the void here and it would
[01:02:56] make sense
[01:03:00] okay I'll type like fill in the blank
[01:03:05] okay uh
[01:03:12] either
[01:03:15] 4.1 permanent events
[01:03:18] or 4.2
[01:03:21] actually no no I think I could make a
[01:03:22] compromise
[01:03:24] some of the better received events could
[01:03:29] be turned into permanent game
[01:03:34] modes
[01:03:36] with challenging with
[01:03:39] scalable
[01:03:41] difficulties and challenges with rewards
[01:03:45] that don't just have to be Primo gems
[01:03:48] things like weapons or untradable
[01:03:52] cosmetics
[01:03:54] five pets
[01:03:57] one in five thousand chance that little
[01:04:01] stormy follows you around after you
[01:04:05] defeat storm Terror
[01:04:07] now players will play the game for hours
[01:04:11] every day
[01:04:14] if they want
[01:04:16] optional
[01:04:18] others can still play 10 minutes then go
[01:04:22] poop
[01:04:25] or while they poop
[01:04:30] six
[01:04:32] little stormy would be so good true
[01:04:36] all my ideas are good
[01:04:38] all my ideas are good
[01:04:40] toggleable constellations
[01:04:44] there is no downside
[01:04:47] I would pull for C6 every five star
[01:04:52] let me please let me
[01:04:55] seven
[01:04:58] I wouldn't by the way I'm not a whale
[01:05:00] but I'm just saying I'm lying
[01:05:03] seven artifact presets actually matter
[01:05:06] of fact I'm gonna put this in case they
[01:05:09] don't read all of my [ __ ] I'm just gonna
[01:05:10] put like expected time
[01:05:14] zero artifact loadouts and then I'll put
[01:05:17] like one
[01:05:18] one
[01:05:20] okay just in case they don't read the
[01:05:21] rest remember when artifact presets
[01:05:24] slash loadouts so that I don't have to
[01:05:27] change the entire ecosystem of the world
[01:05:33] change the rotation of the sun and the
[01:05:36] moon and the stars just to change my
[01:05:40] cookie from Elemental Mastery to HP to
[01:05:44] em that's the same
[01:05:46] because kooky doesn't really make sense
[01:05:50] okay
[01:05:58] eight
[01:06:06] 240 daily resin
[01:06:07] listen here bucko I wish they would do
[01:06:10] that but number one they're not going to
[01:06:11] number two more resin until we get any
[01:06:14] other form of end game probably won't
[01:06:15] happen
[01:06:17] because what the [ __ ] are we gonna
[01:06:18] actually I mean giving us more resin
[01:06:20] won't happen but giving us a bigger
[01:06:21] resin cap might happen maybe more cap
[01:06:23] would happen but they wouldn't make it
[01:06:24] faster if they make it faster we would
[01:06:26] need more end game content and they're
[01:06:27] not gonna give us any content so I don't
[01:06:29] think they do that maybe they'd make the
[01:06:30] bowl bigger though maybe they'd make it
[01:06:31] 240 but that might be copium
[01:06:35] ah that sounds copium
[01:06:40] don't call it
[01:06:45] anyway that is not a bad take because
[01:06:47] it's not just end game like any player
[01:06:49] would like it if it's scalable
[01:06:50] difficulties it's not even hard to
[01:06:52] balance it like yeah it might be like oh
[01:06:54] you don't understand how to battle it
[01:06:55] but like literally it doesn't have to be
[01:06:57] hard like like the last difficulty could
[01:06:59] be like literally insane dog [ __ ] Hell
[01:07:01] mode but like if the rest isn't then
[01:07:03] like people will like it and there'll be
[01:07:05] rewards unless the last reward is like
[01:07:07] big if it's just like different like
[01:07:08] untrainable things and you don't need to
[01:07:10] wail to play it then it's fine
[01:07:17] thank you
[01:07:23] you had highest grades on your high
[01:07:24] school essays didn't you uh I got better
[01:07:26] in university the the thing is I learned
[01:07:29] the art of the [ __ ] sandwich where
[01:07:31] you say like you basically have really
[01:07:34] good things like good information but
[01:07:35] you layer it in [ __ ] so it's like
[01:07:37] you just like ramble and then the
[01:07:38] important stuff and then you ramble and
[01:07:40] it's like a nice [ __ ] sandwich like
[01:07:41] a lot of words and
[01:07:43] true take notes
[01:07:44] it's actually meta it's actually meta
[01:07:46] that's why why do you think there's a
[01:07:47] bunch of YouTube short like literally
[01:07:50] brain damaged in cells that are I guess
[01:07:52] that we're on Twitch uh uh in in
[01:07:54] breedable uh humans that like get a lot
[01:07:57] of traction because they say one thing
[01:07:59] that makes sense then people believe
[01:08:00] them and then they ramble a bunch of
[01:08:01] [ __ ] that gets clicks and then it's
[01:08:03] like a sandwich where it's like oh but
[01:08:04] they said this that made sense but then
[01:08:05] they say a bunch of [ __ ] that doesn't
[01:08:06] make sense
[01:08:09] it's a skill you need to you need to
[01:08:11] learn it I mean don't do that stuff but
[01:08:14] anyways
[01:08:17] that's what got me through University
[01:08:18] yeah dude if you have a 5 000 word essay
[01:08:21] you can't you say 5 000 relevant words
[01:08:23] half of it has to just be padding
[01:08:28] anyways
[01:08:30] um
[01:08:31] this is I don't even want to reread this
[01:08:33] yo when I submit this they have my IP
[01:08:41] ask for a Causeway rerun
[01:08:47] please
[01:08:49] release like 60 sucrose skins so players
[01:08:53] can start using her please please I
[01:08:57] can't take it anymore I can't Causeway
[01:09:01] this kazua that please I beg
[01:09:08] foreign
[01:09:11] muscle buff
[01:09:13] I would ask for new models new character
[01:09:15] models but apparently risley's a bit
[01:09:18] more buff I don't know if that's true
[01:09:20] I'm still gonna ask for it
[01:09:23] different character models more buff
[01:09:28] more
[01:09:30] personality
[01:09:55] it's because access to all of that
[01:09:57] weapons dude I'm telling you if the
[01:09:59] island is
[01:10:00] they literally make events some of the
[01:10:03] events the good ones permanent with
[01:10:04] scalable difficulties and it's like oh I
[01:10:06] can do the Labyrinth event with my
[01:10:07] friends it's Co-op now there's a bunch
[01:10:09] of things I can do I get untrainable
[01:10:10] rewards I get access to an event weapon
[01:10:13] shop though the society would
[01:10:17] foreign
[01:10:49] message

[01:11:00] did I
[01:11:08] anyways we're just gonna leave it like

[01:11:21] I I love this game thank you XD
[01:11:26] yeah I think they'd be reading all of it
[01:11:27] I think they'll read all of it I think
[01:11:29] it's fair to assume they will
[01:11:38] I thought said ban do you think I could
[01:11:40] actually get no dude this is like
[01:11:42] constructive criticism I'm not trolling
[01:11:43] if I was trolling sure it's weird but
[01:11:45] it's actually constructive none of this
[01:11:47] is like not constructive oh yeah
[01:11:49] friendship okay that's actually a good
[01:11:50] idea too
[01:11:52] uh more friendship rewards based on how
[01:11:56] much you play the character to
[01:11:58] incentivize it more
[01:12:04] how do you spell whatever
[01:12:08] all right

[01:15:11] from the city xcc's from okay so this
[01:15:13] explains a lot
[01:15:15] um
[01:15:18] I think the prime side uh however I'm
[01:15:20] gonna I'm not gonna watch all of this
[01:15:22] but I'm gonna link this in my IRL
[01:15:24] friends this like we have a Discord of
[01:15:26] all my like high school friends who
[01:15:27] speak French if they don't respond by
[01:15:29] laughing I'm gonna find you and I'm
[01:15:31] gonna ban you if they think it's funny
[01:15:32] you I will thank you for the donation
[01:15:35] that's what I'm gonna do right now
[01:15:36] that's what I'm gonna do right now
[01:15:37] that's what I'm gonna do right now
[01:15:56] okay I just linked it if you make not
[01:15:58] just me but also my RL friends waste two
[01:16:00] minutes of their life you will be banned
[01:16:23] zero attention span you definitely have
[01:16:26] a collection of fidget Spinners okay
[01:16:28] listen here Boko I can't listen to two
[01:16:31] minutes and a half of a French meme
[01:16:33] where no one in chat is going to
[01:16:35] understand what they're saying
[01:16:37] it's not even just for it's Quebec
[01:16:39] French
[01:16:43] why did someone just link a virus
[01:16:46] what is files.catbox dot MO
[01:17:03] probably just a video
[01:17:07] you said you're gonna add the 07 emote
[01:17:08] wait someone link it though I don't feel
[01:17:10] like looking up I mean I guess I could
[01:17:11] probably just look it up but I'm lazy
[01:17:24] already said they want to make event
[01:17:25] weapons permanent wait what
[01:17:28] they said they won't make any available
[01:17:31] yeah but okay that's understandable oh
[01:17:34] it's still coping but that's fine that's
[01:17:36] not even oh oops they don't need to do
[01:17:39] that though listen listen listen listen
[01:17:40] I think an event weapon shot would be
[01:17:41] cool but let's say they don't want to
[01:17:43] right sure I think they should but
[01:17:45] because especially the Albedo one but it
[01:17:47] is what it is right sure fine
[01:17:48] however
[01:17:50] they can still take some of the good
[01:17:52] events that would literally be permanent
[01:17:54] like content that would make players
[01:17:56] happy like the Labyrinth one where they
[01:17:58] can make scalable difficulties make it
[01:17:59] Co-op make it more fledged out fleshed
[01:18:01] out yep flesh and then just add
[01:18:04] different difficult like different
[01:18:05] rewards like a [ __ ] pet like a glider
[01:18:08] like an animated name card like maybe
[01:18:09] Primo gems but they probably wouldn't or
[01:18:11] like anything else
[01:18:13] that takes little Dev time because they
[01:18:14] already made it and it's already good
[01:18:16] but then it's like basically infinite
[01:18:18] content for us
[01:18:19] and it's not something that like you
[01:18:21] have to do because it's literally just
[01:18:22] like a [ __ ] cosmetic so who cares
[01:18:38] wait did I already do this one
[01:18:40] what am I doing
[01:18:42] so I said are you just repeating the
[01:18:45] same challenge
[01:18:47] listen okay I'm a little
[01:19:03] anyways
[01:19:05] we are now going to uh
[01:19:07] oh Expedition rewards whoa wait I have
[01:19:10] to finish my commissions are we done

[01:19:30] live
[01:19:33] okay respectfully chat might not be the
[01:19:36] best to ask
[01:19:38] um it all depends you know for some
[01:19:41] people
[01:19:49] for some people it's yomiya's smile
[01:19:54] foreign
[01:20:01] go to gym

[01:20:22] appreciate it I appreciate it that's so
[01:20:25] cool okay we're gonna do the hardest
[01:20:27] achievement card not really but the
[01:20:28] challenge one uh but first we're gonna
[01:20:30] explore the new region that came out
[01:20:31] with the Hydra icon kokomi so you guys
[01:20:33] might not have the hardware archon yet
[01:20:34] she's new uh she's coming out you know
[01:20:37] probably next patch but for now uh we're
[01:20:39] gonna at least explore the Hydra archons
[01:20:40] uh area because it just came out which
[01:20:42] is why we haven't cleared it if it was
[01:20:43] old I would 100 of it what the [ __ ] is
[01:20:46] all of this do they really expect me to
[01:20:48] solve all of these surely not surely I
[01:20:50] can just activate John Lee C1 and do it
[01:20:52] right surely
[01:20:54] can I just RNG it do I actually have to
[01:20:56] think you can just smash them in Unga
[01:20:57] Bunga right bro doesn't play the game I
[01:21:00] do
[01:21:05] wait how do you know what you have to
[01:21:07] it's Sudoku wait but where's what's the
[01:21:10] number I'm looking for invest oh my
[01:21:12] God's probably written here
[01:21:17] another
[01:21:19] full no should I actually try okay okay
[01:21:22] should I like solve it or should I just
[01:21:24] like focus and oh someone said it's a
[01:21:26] three-day puzzle can I do it right now
[01:21:35] you can do one stage
[01:21:47] okay [ __ ] it we're gonna we're gonna IQ
[01:21:50] test whatever whatever if I'm a dumbass
[01:21:52] everyone's gonna know right now [ __ ]
[01:21:54] IQ test we're IQ testing this IQ test
[01:21:57] [ __ ] it I'm gonna close chat I'm not
[01:21:59] gonna cool chat I just want to look at
[01:22:00] Chad
[01:22:01] I shall assign a number to each of these
[01:22:04] cubes positions one shall be North East
[01:22:07] shall be two South three West four
[01:22:12] North One South to East three West
[01:22:18] four
[01:22:21] wait I [ __ ] it up I already [ __ ] I
[01:22:23] already [ __ ] up
[01:22:28] Nessa
[01:22:30] okay adding on another four to these
[01:22:32] cubes dude what's nice is I waited so
[01:22:34] long to do this I know you guys forgot
[01:22:35] about it
[01:22:36] wait why does it have zero viewers did
[01:22:38] my stream crash
[01:22:41] why does it say my wait a second what
[01:22:44] just happened no way I thought so hard
[01:22:46] it crashed
[01:22:47] nice stream hello
[01:22:50] hello what happened
[01:22:52] for one second it's back oh well refresh
[01:22:55] I guess what the [ __ ]
[01:22:57] you went offline what
[01:23:06] yeah what's up
[01:23:10] my session just went from four uh from
[01:23:12] one hour to one minute
[01:23:15] okay well anyways adding on another four
[01:23:17] to those cubes with with floating stuff
[01:23:20] gives us five through eight that doesn't
[01:23:22] make sense that doesn't make sense but
[01:23:23] I'm gonna write it
[01:23:24] plus four gives five to eight so I
[01:23:27] assume that means
[01:23:29] equal n
[01:23:31] five and then West will be eight
[01:23:35] I'll write them all down because I'm a
[01:23:36] dumbass so
[01:23:38] maybe E6
[01:23:40] s
[01:23:41] seven
[01:23:43] okay the soul any position shall be nine
[01:23:52] the light of the stones don't seem to
[01:23:53] mean much in that case now then let's
[01:23:55] try to make the sum of the oh my [ __ ]
[01:23:58] god it's Sudoku
[01:24:00] let's try to make the sum of the numbers
[01:24:02] along the horizontal vertical and
[01:24:04] diagonal lines the same
[01:24:07] [Applause]
[01:24:18] rev donated one dollar my partner has
[01:24:21] been showing me your streams and clips
[01:24:23] can't I been enjoying it more than I
[01:24:25] thought but okay I figured it out I
[01:24:28] don't even need to look at Chad I
[01:24:29] figured it out I literally figured it
[01:24:30] out watch watch watch
[01:24:32] does it matter what north east south
[01:24:34] west is I don't think it matters right
[01:24:36] because okay here's what we need to do
[01:24:37] here's what we need to do here's wait
[01:24:38] which one's how do you know what oh
[01:24:40] North is here okay okay watch watch
[01:24:42] here's what you do here's what you do
[01:24:43] there's only wait there's supposed to be
[01:24:44] nine one there's only eight
[01:24:46] where the [ __ ] is the middle one where
[01:24:49] the [ __ ] is the middle one
[01:24:51] oh is the middle one's just zero okay
[01:24:55] oh empty is nine North is okay North is
[01:24:58] one East is two south is three West is
[01:25:02] four
[01:25:03] I don't know what that means
[01:25:05] but if this is nine
[01:25:07] then
[01:25:08] wait does each side have to equate the
[01:25:10] nine because it'd be like it'd be like
[01:25:12] this is nine then this is zero this is
[01:25:14] zero and then this is like okay okay I
[01:25:17] figured out I figured out I figured let
[01:25:18] me cook let me cook let me cook let me
[01:25:20] cook
[01:25:21] well I can't hit this why can't I
[01:25:28] mean let me [ __ ]
[01:25:30] start the timer start the timer
[01:25:37] wait why does it only light up in
[01:25:38] certain positions
[01:25:40] okay
[01:25:42] um
[01:25:44] I don't know if I'm cooking right now
[01:25:45] let me think I'm just trying to figure
[01:25:46] out how this works okay
[01:25:48] oh
[01:25:51] wait why do they only yeah does it
[01:25:54] matter if they light up
[01:25:57] anyways it said north okay wait
[01:26:00] North is one East it says one two three
[01:26:03] four and then you add four to them and
[01:26:05] it gives five eight five to eight
[01:26:08] what
[01:26:10] so that would mean like
[01:26:13] north east south west
[01:26:16] North
[01:26:18] east south
[01:26:21] West so North being one
[01:26:26] so this is one but this is Northwest
[01:26:30] the West is four so is that the line up
[01:26:33] to four
[01:26:36] so is this one plus three and then
[01:26:38] that's four I don't know if that makes
[01:26:39] sense but this is four okay we'll see
[01:26:41] we'll see let me cook let me cook let me
[01:26:42] cook let me cook just let me cook
[01:26:46] wait but no West has to be
[01:26:48] read the book again
[01:26:51] this is a very interesting route indeed
[01:26:53] I shall assign a number to each of the
[01:26:54] used positions
[01:27:02] this doesn't make sense
[01:27:04] oh yeah the lights don't mean anything
[01:27:13] yeah
[01:27:15] oh
[01:27:19] yeah it's not always three but the way
[01:27:22] they look okay okay I don't need time I
[01:27:25] don't need chat only you guys I don't
[01:27:26] need you guys okay so if it's here it's
[01:27:27] like so so so so so so so so that's okay
[01:27:30] okay okay okay okay so this is one and
[01:27:32] then it goes east and that's two and
[01:27:34] then it goes south and that's three and
[01:27:35] it goes west and that's four I see but
[01:27:37] but what does the plus four to each of
[01:27:39] the mean I don't know but now at least I
[01:27:40] know that I know so so so so so if this
[01:27:44] is nine that means that this and this
[01:27:45] have to be [ __ ] zero though because
[01:27:47] you want it all to equal nine but maybe
[01:27:49] it doesn't equal nine
[01:27:52] each side has to be the same sum it
[01:27:54] could be twelve but three times three is
[01:27:56] nine wait maybe it is twelve or another
[01:27:58] multiple of three I don't know maybe
[01:28:00] it's nine plus three plus three what the
[01:28:01] [ __ ] does that give fifteen
[01:28:03] I don't know
[01:28:05] North is one
[01:28:07] East is two
[01:28:09] okay let's put both of these West then
[01:28:12] wait this one can't move
[01:28:14] it's Northwoods one so that's Ten Ben
[01:28:15] Ten okay let's make it twelve [ __ ] it
[01:28:18] let's make it 12.
[01:28:26] okay I just cheated because I saw in
[01:28:27] chat okay the hats mean I didn't know
[01:28:30] some of them had hats why do some have
[01:28:32] hats why okay the Hat the hat is what
[01:28:35] they mean when they say they add four
[01:28:36] okay I get it I get it I get it I get it
[01:28:38] I get it okay okay okay so this one is
[01:28:40] [ __ ]
[01:28:42] stuck as one this one is stuck as nine
[01:28:44] I'll put a fake one here that's nine and
[01:28:47] then this one is is is is is is is is is
[01:28:48] is is is is is is is is is whatever I
[01:28:51] choose
[01:28:53] also can't move this one's stuck as
[01:28:55] four
[01:28:56] okay so watch this nine nine watches
[01:28:58] watches intellect nine
[01:29:01] wait no this one's nine this one is
[01:29:03] stuck as I'm gonna draw this on my
[01:29:04] notepad so I don't [ __ ] forget I'll
[01:29:06] let you guys see my notepad though
[01:29:10] so it's
[01:29:19] no no no X nine and then that one is
[01:29:22] stuck as what four what is this one
[01:29:24] stuck as no it's north so it's one
[01:29:29] okay watch us watch this so nine one
[01:29:32] right so that's ten this one can be
[01:29:35] anything I don't know what a good sum is
[01:29:37] but I assume it should be a multiple of
[01:29:38] two of F3 sorry only multiple of three
[01:29:41] you can make with ten is twelve you go
[01:29:43] to 15 but I don't think that's possible
[01:29:45] and you can't subtract so it's probably
[01:29:47] 12. so so 9 plus plus plus plus one
[01:29:52] and then you want 12 so it has to be two
[01:29:53] North is one so East is two I got this i
[01:29:57] got this i got this i got this i got
[01:29:58] this this better give me a [ __ ]
[01:30:00] luxurious chest okay so that's that's 12
[01:30:02] no yeah that's 12. then you want this
[01:30:04] one to be 12. so this one is this one is
[01:30:06] this one is this one is what is it again
[01:30:07] this is one this is a has a [ __ ] hat
[01:30:10] and this one also has that can I move
[01:30:11] both of these
[01:30:13] is again
[01:30:15] uh one plus something plus something to
[01:30:17] give 12. these have to add up to 11.
[01:30:20] what the [ __ ] adds up to eleven six and
[01:30:22] five so
[01:30:27] five or six
[01:30:30] six or five
[01:30:32] we don't know
[01:30:35] East is
[01:30:37] four five so this is five and then this
[01:30:39] one makes six that one was already six I
[01:30:40] [ __ ] up
[01:30:46] so this should be six
[01:30:50] wait North isn't this way
[01:30:53] [Music]
[01:30:57] why is North this way okay okay I am
[01:31:00] [ __ ] my whole calculation is cooked I
[01:31:03] my whole calculation is cooked okay wait
[01:31:06] this is still nine but this one is
[01:31:08] [ __ ] this is facing
[01:31:10] East
[01:31:12] [ __ ] it's Facing East it's Facing East
[01:31:15] it's Facing East I didn't look at my
[01:31:17] [ __ ] Compass okay this one's Facing
[01:31:19] East which means uh East is two right
[01:31:22] East is two so this one has to be two
[01:31:24] which means now it's 11 which means we
[01:31:27] can make 12 or just 12. it's still 12
[01:31:30] right it's still 12.
[01:31:34] well 11 plus 4 gives fifteen oh it could
[01:31:37] be 15. [ __ ] it's probably 15.
[01:31:43] wait which way is this is West right no
[01:31:45] this is north
[01:31:46] West is
[01:31:48] here West is South I hate this game
[01:31:51] so now this makes 15. I don't know if
[01:31:54] it's 15 or 12 but
[01:31:56] 15 or 12. okay let's say it's 15 this
[01:31:58] would be this is now
[01:32:02] four
[01:32:08] now this one okay so because this is
[01:32:11] this one is is is is is is is is is is
[01:32:13] is e so it's two this one is two because
[01:32:17] it's two and you want fifteen
[01:32:19] that's 12 uh 12 divided by two uh uh
[01:32:23] what we want to do is six and six let's
[01:32:25] say let's say six and six let's say six
[01:32:27] and six it could also be like seven and
[01:32:29] five there's multiple ways to do it it
[01:32:31] could be six or seven or five and then
[01:32:36] this one could also be or seven okay
[01:32:38] okay okay
[01:32:40] um
[01:32:43] let's say both are six which way is six
[01:32:45] uh uh uh uh North is one plus four
[01:32:48] that's five put it up East it would be
[01:32:50] uh six so East is is is is this way so
[01:32:54] we hit this boom it's the [ __ ]
[01:33:06] oh
[01:33:09] oh it's just simple logic math and
[01:33:13] deduction
[01:33:17] he's just too good it's just that easy
[01:33:21] it's just that easy honestly it's just
[01:33:23] that easy it's just that easy he just
[01:33:25] cooked now TP away and do the second one
[01:33:28] there's no way that that's a thing right
[01:33:31] you got it randomly no I didn't no I
[01:33:33] didn't no I didn't
[01:33:35] I guess it was seven and five not six
[01:33:37] and six but like how would I know that
[01:33:51] this better give me a luxurious chest
[01:33:58] it can't be six and six that's not how
[01:34:00] Sudoku works I sorry do I have to look
[01:34:03] up the rules of another game
[01:34:11] is it the same thing
[01:34:20] the same rules
[01:34:24] oh wait there's the empty ones here the
[01:34:26] empty one is now South
[01:34:28] which means which means which means
[01:34:29] which means it means the the South one
[01:34:32] okay well I thought the last one was
[01:34:34] South because I'm stupid
[01:34:35] you going can solve this
[01:34:42] let's see let's see let's see let's see
[01:34:43] let's see let's see let's see let's see
[01:34:45] let's see let's see let's see let's go
[01:34:47] let's cook let them cook let them cook
[01:34:50] let them cook let him cook let him cook
[01:34:54] let him cook
[01:35:00] [Music]
[01:35:10] do you think zombie pillar is running it
[01:35:13] quake
[01:35:37] don't be scared
[01:35:52] okay let's actually do this let's
[01:35:53] actually do this look look Speed Run I
[01:35:55] start the timer if this takes me more
[01:35:57] than 10 minutes I will buy everyone a
[01:35:58] pizza watch this watch this watch this
[01:36:00] watch this okay look so this the South
[01:36:02] Middle position is we know it's nine we
[01:36:04] know it's nine these are all X's
[01:36:10] watch this watches watches watches so we
[01:36:12] know this is nine this one is uh movable
[01:36:16] this one is uh unmovable it is facing
[01:36:19] whist
[01:36:20] Is that West
[01:36:23] that is East uh so it's East is is is
[01:36:26] East is two East is two East is two East
[01:36:29] is two this one is two so nine plus two
[01:36:32] is eleven this one could be anything it
[01:36:34] could be twelve um
[01:36:36] 12 plus uh 11 plus 4 is 15. it could be
[01:36:39] 12 or 15 let's assume it's 15 again
[01:36:41] could be 12. so this is either one or
[01:36:43] four
[01:36:45] okay
[01:36:48] if it's South that means it's four
[01:36:58] well you can't move this one
[01:37:02] isn't it North wait what this is not
[01:37:04] North
[01:37:05] no no it's facing this way which is
[01:37:07] Focus
[01:37:12] I wanted it to be East right
[01:37:17] wait what way is this
[01:37:19] that's West
[01:37:24] no I want it to be four yes I want it to
[01:37:26] be West I want to be West I want to be
[01:37:27] West
[01:37:28] so this way is west
[01:37:31] okay okay
[01:37:33] this one can't move which makes things
[01:37:35] easy because it's a hat and it's Facing
[01:37:38] East hat and East that's five no it's
[01:37:42] six four plus two six so this one is six
[01:37:45] six plus two is eight plus four is
[01:37:49] twelve oh this one has a hat on it
[01:37:51] though
[01:37:53] which means we can get 15. uh uh uh uh
[01:37:56] eight fifteen minus eight is five plus
[01:37:59] two which is seven so we want this to be
[01:38:01] seven if we want fifteen how do you get
[01:38:02] seven it's four plus three three is is
[01:38:04] is is is south
[01:38:07] so we wanted to face itself
[01:38:12] I just made it face South wait no this
[01:38:15] way is south
[01:38:17] okay I'm cooking I'm cooking I'm cooking
[01:38:21] this is 15. diagonal six plus one is
[01:38:23] seven can I get 15 in the middle
[01:38:27] the middle has to have a hat it does
[01:38:30] what would give us 15. six plus one is
[01:38:33] seven fifteen minus uh uh seven is eight
[01:38:36] how do you get eight four plus four so
[01:38:38] South
[01:38:40] that should be eight right
[01:38:42] no West
[01:38:46] what's this way
[01:38:55] wait no but my bottom right is four
[01:38:57] right wait what's my bottom right
[01:39:00] oh my bottom right is wait what my
[01:39:02] bottom right is yeah my bottom right is
[01:39:04] four which means uh we have to change
[01:39:06] the equation six plus four is ten in
[01:39:08] order to get fifteen this has to be five
[01:39:09] five is north
[01:39:15] this is north right
[01:39:17] wait North is
[01:39:19] [Music]
[01:39:21] an angel this way is North okay okay I'm
[01:39:25] cooking I'm cooking okay so now we have
[01:39:28] to get 15 on every Square so this this
[01:39:31] has to be 15 what is nine plus five
[01:39:33] that's fourteen [ __ ] this has to be one
[01:39:36] can this be one
[01:39:39] which way is north north is this way so
[01:39:43] foreign
[01:39:53] actually not even luck he cooked he
[01:39:56] cooked he cooked he cooked a meal he
[01:39:58] cooked
[01:40:03] yeah they call me the mathematician no
[01:40:05] big deal
[01:40:08] it's been more than 10 minutes no the
[01:40:09] [ __ ] it wasn't that was actually fast
[01:40:11] that was not more than 10 minutes that
[01:40:13] was literally like five
[01:40:16] wait they're gone
[01:40:19] it was 3 22.
[01:40:21] that was good just in case you have to
[01:40:24] relog we'll do the trial because it'll
[01:40:26] reload
[01:40:28] was there only two no I only got an
[01:40:30] Exquisite chest for that
[01:40:33] time to act
[01:40:39] it's three what if I already did one
[01:40:41] though
[01:40:44] oh [ __ ] College let me see is there
[01:40:48] anything new is it the same thing
[01:40:52] okay it's fine
[01:40:57] foreign
[01:41:02] this won't take us long at all look
[01:41:04] we're gonna replace this with x's
[01:41:11] well just
[01:41:12] watch this so this one is nine again
[01:41:14] nine is in the same position
[01:41:17] let's see which ones are immovable
[01:41:18] objects nope
[01:41:22] this one's immovable it's facing is this
[01:41:25] e is this is this
[01:41:28] which way is this that's South South is
[01:41:31] is is is is seven right South this is
[01:41:33] three plus four so seven right yep seven
[01:41:36] seven seven seven wait which one is this
[01:41:38] one this is the this one so this one is
[01:41:40] seven
[01:41:43] this one is movable
[01:41:46] this one is not movable it's facing
[01:41:48] north which means this one is is worth
[01:41:51] one look at how fast I'm about to solve
[01:41:53] this
[01:41:56] it's removable
[01:41:57] this one is not movable which means it
[01:42:00] is facing south south is
[01:42:05] South is three boom is this one movable
[01:42:09] yes it is is this one movable
[01:42:12] wait Middle's not movable did I already
[01:42:14] count for that one wait what
[01:42:16] wait this is not movable so it's it's
[01:42:18] [ __ ] we already know the sum it's
[01:42:20] facing north and it's five which means
[01:42:23] nine plus five plus one that's [ __ ]
[01:42:25] fifteen it is fifteen okay seven plus is
[01:42:28] this 15 yes that is we need to make the
[01:42:31] dot how does the [ __ ] diagonals work
[01:42:33] wait a second so
[01:42:35] let's say this is
[01:42:38] let's say it's like four and six let's
[01:42:41] say four six six plus five that's eleven
[01:42:44] this would have to be four is nine plus
[01:42:45] four plus four fifteen no
[01:42:48] [ __ ]
[01:42:49] wait nine plus wait this doesn't have to
[01:42:52] be four though
[01:42:53] nine plus four is uh thirteen so this
[01:42:56] could be two if this is two then five
[01:42:58] plus two is is is is is is is is is why
[01:43:02] can't I do five or seven don't put off
[01:43:04] until tomorrow no but that doesn't work
[01:43:06] because seven plus four isn't the same
[01:43:08] as five plus two hmm
[01:43:10] wait I need to think harder
[01:43:18] okay
[01:43:19] I [ __ ] up my charts I [ __ ] up my
[01:43:23] chart because my control Z doesn't work
[01:43:24] anymore
[01:43:26] my control Z doesn't work anymore I
[01:43:28] [ __ ] up the chart
[01:43:37] are you sure the directions are right
[01:43:40] there is no way you're
[01:43:43] okay we're gonna check for one last time
[01:43:45] this one is nine no matter what
[01:43:48] this one is facing
[01:43:52] West so it's four it can move sorry this
[01:43:56] one wait they both can move okay we're
[01:43:58] not we're gonna delete our last row
[01:43:59] we're gonna delete our last row
[01:44:02] this one can move it's facing
[01:44:06] South and it has a hat which means it's
[01:44:09] seven so that's seven
[01:44:12] this one can not move it's facing
[01:44:15] North so it's five middle one is five
[01:44:18] yes sir yes sir yes sir this one can
[01:44:20] move no it can't it's facing it's facing
[01:44:23] it's facing it's facing south so it's
[01:44:26] three and then the top right one I'm
[01:44:28] gonna verify is unknown so we're gonna
[01:44:30] replace this with an X I'm pretty sure
[01:44:32] these are all known this one is stuck at
[01:44:33] one okay now we just have to make 15 out
[01:44:35] of everything this shouldn't be hard
[01:44:36] this shouldn't be hard let's say we want
[01:44:38] let's say we want okay I'm gonna copy
[01:44:40] paste this so that I remember that
[01:44:41] that's a good one okay let's say here we
[01:44:44] want we want 15 right we want 15. how do
[01:44:46] we get fifteen seven plus seven plus
[01:44:48] three is ten then we put a five here is
[01:44:51] this doable though I don't know let's
[01:44:53] see
[01:44:55] nine plus five that's fourteen so this
[01:44:58] could be one one plus five plus three is
[01:44:59] not 15 though so it can't be that this
[01:45:01] is wrong it cannot be that
[01:45:05] uh these ones are the nine here is
[01:45:08] [ __ ] which means this has to be a big
[01:45:09] number this one can't so this has to be
[01:45:11] a big number how do we make 15 with a
[01:45:13] small number here and a big number there
[01:45:14] this could be one and then this one
[01:45:16] could be a big number seven plus one is
[01:45:17] eight plus two plus five that's another
[01:45:19] seven so this could be seven
[01:45:21] hypothetically let's put that at seven
[01:45:24] top left has to be seven how do you get
[01:45:26] seven it's four plus three so as to face
[01:45:29] South
[01:45:35] that's West which way is south
[01:45:38] this is south
[01:45:44] okay
[01:45:45] so this one is seven
[01:45:47] then this one is one right seven plus
[01:45:50] one is eight eight plus uh uh uh uh uh
[01:45:53] uh what am I looking for fifteen that's
[01:45:55] that's seven so this has to be seven
[01:45:57] what is seven seven is South right
[01:46:00] seven is South which way is south this
[01:46:03] way itself
[01:46:07] wait that's wonderful it's wonderful
[01:46:09] okay okay
[01:46:12] so this is what this is top right
[01:46:17] this works 717 is this is this one seven
[01:46:22] well I'm about to win I'm about to win I
[01:46:25] just hit the other one random times
[01:46:26] until it works I got it I actually got
[01:46:27] it actually got it watch watch this one
[01:46:29] watch watch this is
[01:46:32] this is 15 oh seven percent wait this is
[01:46:35] fifteen this is 15.
[01:46:37] that's fifteen seven plus three plus
[01:46:39] plus plus plus plus plus plus five is
[01:46:42] fifteen nine plus five plus one is
[01:46:43] fifteen I just make the bottom right one
[01:46:45] five
[01:46:46] wait but it can't be five because it's a
[01:46:48] [ __ ] it doesn't have a hat it doesn't
[01:46:50] have a hat oh my God I can't make it
[01:46:51] five there's no [ __ ] hat oh my God
[01:46:55] okay
[01:46:58] seven plus five oh there's a diagonal
[01:47:01] here
[01:47:01] that's twelves this has to be three
[01:47:04] [ __ ] I'm gonna have to redo everything
[01:47:10] In the Arms of an Angel
[01:47:18] foreign
[01:47:23] you have no even numbers um okay that's
[01:47:26] true actually okay look so this is the
[01:47:29] base puzzle right this is the bass
[01:47:30] puzzle okay so if we know this is the
[01:47:32] base puzzle right let's let's let's make
[01:47:34] this easier let's add let's
[01:47:36] hypothetically let's add like a two here
[01:47:38] I feel like two just looks nice here and
[01:47:40] then if this is two this has to be uh a
[01:47:43] 10 but that's impossible okay never mind
[01:47:44] never mind we're gonna put a two here a
[01:47:46] two looks nice there we'll put a two in
[01:47:48] the bottom left corner and I end my turn
[01:47:50] so so East is two this way is east
[01:47:53] wait it was ready to am I stupid
[01:48:00] okay
[01:48:03] good there seven plus two is nine
[01:48:07] then this would be uh uh five plus one
[01:48:09] six does that make sense I think that
[01:48:11] makes sense this one is six six is uh
[01:48:15] North East it's East
[01:48:19] is this East that's North that's East
[01:48:22] wait I'm actually cooking I'm actually
[01:48:24] cooking because look six plus seven plus
[01:48:26] two is fifteen
[01:48:28] nine plus two plus uh uh uh uh uh four
[01:48:32] is fifth fifteen and then that is 15
[01:48:35] diagonal bottom right as before bottom
[01:48:36] right is before bottom right is before
[01:48:38] four is uh South no it's West boom
[01:48:42] I'm about to get a chance watches oh my
[01:48:43] God a chest
[01:48:47] this way fifteen
[01:48:49] now all we have left is this one top
[01:48:53] right
[01:49:00] I cooked I cooked and he cooked could I
[01:49:03] have just looked up a YouTube video yes
[01:49:04] but but do I need it no the YouTube
[01:49:06] videos need me
[01:49:11] he cooked this puzzle just came out by
[01:49:13] the way there probably isn't even a
[01:49:14] guide because this is the brand new
[01:49:16] Hydra archon Island
[01:49:19] he's just he's just different like that
[01:49:20] that's why I watch the Hawks because
[01:49:21] he's just built different
[01:49:23] he doesn't just take the easy way out
[01:49:28] that was such a waste of time but we got
[01:49:29] three [ __ ] chests
[01:49:31] what's our exploration oh 46 not bad for
[01:49:34] a video that just got out today not bad
[01:49:36] for a video that just came out today I
[01:49:38] mean for uh an island that just came out
[01:49:39] today
[01:49:42] not bad not bad for a brand new region
[01:49:52] wait what what okay
[01:50:04] to do
[01:50:09] bro what
[01:50:13] what does it want me why are the [ __ ]

[01:50:36] help me go it's over there
[01:50:52] ah
[01:50:59] this is the worst puzzle this is the
[01:51:01] worst [ __ ] dog [ __ ] thing I've ever
[01:51:03] done why is it giving me electrogranums
[01:51:06] but the balls aren't even lined up with
[01:51:08] them
[01:51:09] who designs this
[01:51:13] follow me

[01:51:37] um I can actually because this region is
[01:51:39] New I can actually equip the Electoral
[01:51:41] treasure Compass uh well I could put it
[01:51:44] in like the multiple thing where's the
[01:51:45] multiple one
[01:51:48] wait where's the multi-gadget thing
[01:51:51] I don't know what it looks like it's
[01:51:52] been so long
[01:52:02] this ain't no it's a seed dispensary
[01:52:06] hold z Oh I can just hold z Oh I thought
[01:52:10] it was like something at the equip okay
[01:52:11] cool
[01:52:12] whoa there's a chest down there
[01:52:15] surely after this chest will be 100
[01:52:17] espresso and I don't have to be honest

[02:09:10] two achievements
[02:09:12] sheesh hey hey plus one that easy easy
[02:09:17] okay
[02:09:19] um good enough for now good enough for
[02:09:21] now now what we're going to do is get
[02:09:23] the new name card the challenged one uh
[02:09:26] the Challenger Series which is uh we
[02:09:29] have to uh fight these new bosses
[02:09:31] it's a combat one
[02:09:34] and uh that's pretty cool so we're gonna
[02:09:37] start by getting defeating the
[02:09:39] millennial Pearl seahorse while it is
[02:09:41] attempting to reconstruct a pylon I
[02:09:43] don't know what that means I don't know
[02:09:45] what that means but let's go let's go
[02:09:46] see what it means so we have to fight
[02:09:48] the seahorse sorry
[02:09:51] so happens
[02:09:53] is this guy always like this first
[02:09:54] message what do you mean like what
[02:09:56] like what tell me
[02:10:09] where is it
[02:10:20] heard you watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
[02:10:24] thank you
[02:10:24] I mean what's really bizarre is the fact
[02:10:26] you get no [ __ ]
[02:10:30] I mean I hear you love anime girls but
[02:10:32] you can't talk to women
[02:10:35] yeah well the good news is you love
[02:10:37] Hanks so you're not all there's no such
[02:10:39] thing as freedom in this world
[02:10:41] even the wind connected
[02:10:43] Bizarre Adventure
[02:10:48] yeah
[02:10:50] so that's pretty bizarre
[02:10:56] well it doesn't have anything to do with
[02:10:57] anything right now
[02:10:59] uh uh I don't know I just thought about
[02:11:01] it I thought it was funny
[02:11:04] okay so I don't know how to get this
[02:11:05] achievement but I assume we have to
[02:11:06] break the the the the the the the the
[02:11:08] the the the
[02:11:09] uh the electro Shield thingy so we can
[02:11:12] play a dendro team that has a lot of
[02:11:14] Elemental application maybe a pyro as
[02:11:16] well uh uh who's the best pirate
[02:11:18] application the fastest one in the game
[02:11:20] probably day off she has the best up
[02:11:22] time the fastest pyro the best probably
[02:11:24] pyro unit just in general so Dale would
[02:11:26] be great here I don't know why I have
[02:11:27] Electro characters though that doesn't
[02:11:28] really make sense I just realized I
[02:11:29] don't know what this team is so we're
[02:11:31] gonna put uh the second best pyro
[02:11:33] character shinyan and then we'll put
[02:11:34] another dendro maybe I'll hide them
[02:11:36] Let's Jam
[02:11:38] let's not uh that's not
[02:11:42] Let's Jam
[02:11:46] Let's Get It On
[02:11:56] wait so wait I have to read the
[02:11:58] achievement wait so what exactly do I
[02:11:59] have to do for Challenger Series v i i i
[02:12:05] have to defeat it while it's attempting
[02:12:07] to reconstruct
[02:12:09] so when it's probably it's probably
[02:12:11] gonna be recharging something probably
[02:12:12] the shield but I don't know what that
[02:12:13] looks like so let's get it low and let's
[02:12:15] get ready
[02:12:16] okay my team doesn't do damage I'm
[02:12:19] playing burning
[02:12:21] diffract
[02:12:30] solve okay wait so it's probably gonna
[02:12:32] be like reconstructing something

[02:42:14] it doesn't I guess it doesn't like
[02:42:16] mismatch her that much I just don't like
[02:42:18] it
[02:42:20] I know it's like Attack on Titan sword
[02:42:22] sure I just genuinely don't like it I
[02:42:24] don't think it matters though because I
[02:42:25] use weapons based on how they perform so
[02:42:27] I don't really care
[02:42:29] but I also think dull blade is funnier
[02:42:32] I don't know maybe I keep her on Dublin
[02:42:34] I give this to Kirara what's my Kirara
[02:42:36] on
[02:42:37] what's my Kirara on
[02:42:39] she's on two caboose
[02:42:52] where's Kirara
[02:43:00] double blade is ugly too no it's not it
[02:43:03] comes with her nilu loves the dull blade
[02:43:18] foreign
[02:43:24] I didn't look yet
[02:43:35] okay A little 50 for now
[02:43:40] Loki it kind of matches
[02:43:48] actually looks better
[02:43:50] look crafting okay I mean to be fair I
[02:43:53] think engulfing lightning matches out
[02:43:55] really well I think this sphere looks
[02:43:56] good on him did it [ __ ] matches his
[02:43:58] skirt and his pants
[02:44:02] I actually look sick on them
[02:44:15] also why the [ __ ] did they do this thing
[02:44:17] where okay HP and Greaser decreases you
[02:44:20] get above so this would be good for Xiao
[02:44:21] but it's not punch attack damage and
[02:44:23] then floor 12 has [ __ ] has [ __ ]
[02:44:25] Animo resistance on the first half and a
[02:44:27] Nemo resistance on the second half
[02:44:29] why do they hate me why do they hate you
[02:44:35] they hate me
[02:44:48] okay
[02:44:54] assuming you know nothing about farina's
[02:44:56] Kit and you're just asking hey what if I
[02:44:58] use nebula with Arena how do I get three
[02:44:59] socks assuming you're answering the
[02:45:01] asking the question like that the only
[02:45:03] answer is let's say you're using another
[02:45:05] Hydra right let's say you're using
[02:45:06] another Hydro let's put [ __ ] kokomi
[02:45:08] here whatever and then you're playing
[02:45:09] like Fishel and then like like Kazo
[02:45:12] right sure
[02:45:13] you're only going to get two stocks
[02:45:15] unless you're C1 if you see one you get
[02:45:16] a free stock with that said does it
[02:45:18] really matter
[02:45:19] I mean it doesn't really like who the
[02:45:21] [ __ ] cares if you're if you're second if
[02:45:23] the other Hydro character is a better
[02:45:25] DPS increase to your team than like 16
[02:45:28] 10 or whatever 15 damage
[02:45:31] then it doesn't really matter because
[02:45:33] never let's one yeah he's like he
[02:45:35] carries a lot but he's also not the only
[02:45:37] source of damage in your team
[02:45:43] and then number well you might have sack
[02:45:44] Jaden if you have stock traded like R5
[02:45:46] then it isn't and then number three you
[02:45:48] get Hydra resonance with another Hydra
[02:45:49] which is like 20 hp I think I don't know
[02:45:51] why I don't know this yeah 25. uh it's
[02:45:53] new in my defense but 25 HP which is a
[02:45:55] decent amount so it's not like it
[02:45:57] matters that much
[02:45:59] going for three stocks isn't the only
[02:46:03] um
[02:46:04] thing you should be going for
[02:46:09] it's 28 wait what's 28.
[02:46:18] 20 average off on CA yeah but that's
[02:46:20] what I'm talking about I'm saying the
[02:46:22] damage increase to your nebulance damage
[02:46:23] overall isn't that high because there's
[02:46:25] also skill and burst and he's also not
[02:46:27] that big of a he's a big portion of your
[02:46:30] team's damage he's most of it but he's
[02:46:31] not all of it so there's a calc done and
[02:46:34] ever that means although I know you
[02:46:35] can't blindly trust main discords to
[02:46:37] calc everything perfectly however uh
[02:46:40] they seem like cool and competent people
[02:46:41] and with that said
[02:46:46] they had a thing where is it let me find
[02:46:49] it
[02:46:51] okay
[02:47:02] his most popular copies using him with
[02:47:04] Fab child okay but you are weird
[02:47:07] dude why would you pull for child to do
[02:47:10] that
[02:47:12] foreign
[02:47:37] yeah there's this thing
[02:47:38] but
[02:47:39] I mean I think C1 is great unironically
[02:47:42] because it also makes you comfy like if
[02:47:44] you're playing a team like that if
[02:47:44] you're planning on playing like double
[02:47:45] Hydra or something then it's really nice
[02:47:47] but if you're not
[02:47:50] you're probably fine also that his his
[02:47:52] signature weapon is like kind of insane
[02:47:56] that's so cool yeah yeah yeah
[02:47:59] go check out their uh Discord
[02:48:02] is Jade better even if I have better
[02:48:03] crit stats with witsith
[02:48:11] sacrificial Jade also gives you HP which
[02:48:14] is a valuable stat it's not just crit
[02:48:17] uh your widget might be better if you
[02:48:19] reset every single time you don't get
[02:48:21] the two music notes
[02:48:23] and then when you get that you have
[02:48:24] elemental damage bonus and if you get
[02:48:25] anything else you just leave the game
[02:48:27] then maybe but on average yes Jade will
[02:48:30] be better
[02:48:34] okay I kind of want to try a new team I
[02:48:36] mean I'm probably not gonna do this uh
[02:48:37] what do we want to play what do we want
[02:48:39] to do what do we want to do what do we
[02:48:40] want to do

[02:49:13] be
[02:49:23] laughs
[02:49:25] oh Bob remember might be better first no
[02:49:27] Barbara probably
[02:49:29] Barbara is good here Barbara's good this
[02:49:32] thing is gonna be annoying and then
[02:49:35] Barbara plunge attacks is probably gonna
[02:49:37] be funny
[02:49:41] yeah we'll do some Barbara punch talks

[02:49:45] yo me I don't have her who else

[02:49:59] who else
[02:50:01] I know this thing's a lecture we can't
[02:50:03] I mean we probably still could
[02:50:05] because he's probably good here he's
[02:50:07] probably good here I could probably get
[02:50:08] through this with support characters but
[02:50:09] yeah
[02:50:11] could play never let solo but we already
[02:50:13] did that

[02:51:23] might be like sucks why isn't this wine

[02:51:49] we can just heal ourselves

[02:52:05] than 88 crit damage and it's [ __ ]
[02:52:08] eight uh 14 times three charge stock

[02:52:12] of the energy but
[02:52:19] no there's no way
[02:52:21] maybe if you're playing like taser
[02:52:22] barber in your normal attacking but
[02:52:23] we're gonna charge attack we're trying
[02:52:25] to vape
[02:52:26] how's your HP gonna decrease you just
[02:52:28] take damage what do you mean
[02:52:34] I mean the stocks don't last for long
[02:52:35] but we're just going for a screenshot so
[02:52:37] it doesn't matter
[02:52:38] the damage
[02:52:46] play virgin true actually we could do we
[02:52:50] could do burning and we stand next to

[02:52:57] Bennett kazua

[02:53:25] crit we don't even need a lot
[02:53:27] like I don't want to have crit rate

[02:53:39] tallest grizzliest hottest streamer's
[02:53:42] eye zero triple X thank you for the

[02:54:23] wait this is good this is actually
[02:54:25] pretty good
[02:54:29] it's pretty good
[02:54:41] because we also have attack
[02:54:44] your Barber's gonna have no attack we
[02:54:45] are playing Bennett with no bless and
[02:54:47] maybe power resonance I don't know yet
[02:54:49] doesn't matter
[02:54:53] oh we don't want a crit rate circuit
[02:54:55] though because we just care about crit
[02:54:56] damage we're just going for a screenshot
[02:55:03] this is Loki too much crit rate all good
[02:55:05] I'll get all good
[02:55:12] we have the normal
[02:55:14] burst or normal charge or probably got a
[02:55:18] normal charge
[02:55:19] skill normal charge we've got three
[02:55:20] stacks
[02:55:28] oh we're on a [ __ ] HP goblet
[02:55:41] foreign
[02:55:45] [Music]
[02:55:50] how much would I have
[02:55:53] 289 okay
[02:56:02] uh I could change my hydro goblet to
[02:56:04] something that has a look or damage just
[02:56:06] a little just a little stay in the
[02:56:08] middle don't want a riddle I play the
[02:56:10] fiddle we can do this one for now
[02:56:12] [ __ ] our ayato a little but 60 to 47 187
[02:56:15] Em which is like having a string uh Sans
[02:56:18] uh and then uh I mean we do have a sense
[02:56:25] I don't know why I said like having a
[02:56:26] sense when I literally had a sense
[02:56:28] but yeah
[02:56:31] I could also play Four shimanawas
[02:56:33] shimanas is also good for Barbara
[02:56:35] that attack is Tiny we have Bennett and
[02:56:37] a blast it's fine
[02:56:40] it doesn't actually matter
[02:56:43] pretty sure em sounds is better here
[02:56:45] because we're gonna Vape
[02:56:48] uh also Nim stream gives you attack
[02:56:56] foreign
[02:57:08] I need my Bennett to have the most ER
[02:57:10] though so I might unironically get
[02:57:12] vetted like Skyward instead of Aquila
[02:57:15] no that's probably dumb
[02:57:36] okay we're ready
[02:57:40] instructor Bennett
[02:57:44] I don't suppose you have sapwood I do
[02:57:46] have stopwood what do you mean I used to
[02:57:47] happen all the time
[02:57:49] do we want sapwood now though are we
[02:57:50] gonna pick up the leaf
[02:57:54] I mean it's also only R1
[02:58:07] Gamba on Barbara abyssrun
[02:58:12] okay
[02:58:20] we're gonna do Barbara
[02:58:22] Bennett kazua
[02:58:27] now last thought is either Zhang Lee
[02:58:30] pick up the Petra Crystal Nikita for
[02:58:33] burning
[02:58:35] or shangling
[02:59:02] oh nahida does give yeah maybe attack
[02:59:05] sense is better than no but we don't
[02:59:07] even have one
[02:59:09] we don't even have one I could give my
[02:59:11] Nikita more em though and he doesn't
[02:59:12] like a crit circlet
[02:59:14] it's fine
[02:59:17] first off we play we need to clear fast
[02:59:19] so probably I'll hide them
[02:59:24] or just Navidad I guess but maybe that
[02:59:26] wants I mean we could just do no but I
[02:59:29] did I [ __ ] his build up he's not like
[02:59:30] wits if

[03:04:31] that was a while ago now it's been a
[03:04:33] while we're still climbing we still have
[03:04:34] like a 70 win rate well 50 on 55 on jet

[03:12:11] make sure we have our burst for solve
[03:12:12] three I'm still gonna restart this
[03:12:14] though if I don't Three Star this I will
[03:12:15] give everyone a chat seven million
[03:12:17] dollars
[03:12:20] okay we're not gonna Three Star this
[03:12:21] wait I actually can't actually I need to
[03:12:23] get better off though I need to get
[03:12:24] better
[03:12:35] we're still looking at three star
[03:12:36] accounts we're still gonna three star
[03:12:37] that didn't count because it wasn't a
[03:12:38] two star we didn't we didn't finish it
[03:12:40] that was terrible gameplay I can't lie
[03:12:42] wait my mic is loose let me fix it I
[03:12:43] don't know what I did to it I have to
[03:12:45] screw the screw

[03:13:28] bro bro what are you doing you stupid
[03:13:31] Pizza cutting
[03:13:33] quietly now here comes the catch
[03:13:41] [Music]
[03:13:52] okay when do I nahida here maybe at the
[03:13:54] end because okay let's end playing child
[03:13:56] Bennett causa right you can child e so
[03:13:59] there's Hydro then you bet it alt and
[03:14:00] then you cause roll both right okay with
[03:14:03] Barbara it's like I'm dry I use the
[03:14:05] heater and then it [ __ ] dendros and
[03:14:06] then it blooms and then I don't swirl
[03:14:08] so maybe I start with the heat I mean I
[03:14:10] don't need at the start all right Nikita
[03:14:12] burst but I don't eat then I eat later
[03:14:15] so I get burning
[03:14:19] do I have been adults [ __ ] okay well
[03:14:21] this is gonna uh
[03:14:24] we're just gonna funnel funnel funnel
[03:14:26] funnel cakes get your funnel cakes here
[03:14:32] okay so we did this
[03:14:33] okay that removed Hydro or Hydro or it
[03:14:37] wasn't good it's fine we do this then we
[03:14:38] should self-swirl pyro Nikita I promise
[03:14:43] I promise
[03:14:44] please
[03:14:45] [Music]
[03:14:47] 142 but benedals was leaving I I think

[03:15:50] classroom is laughing
[03:15:53] can I charge that yes or no
[03:15:57] listen
[03:16:06] a process of elimination
[03:16:13] we used a lot of bursts but all good
[03:16:17] Let Me Wait for my stamina
[03:16:20] [Music]
[03:16:30] huh
[03:16:32] yeah oh
[03:16:36] let's light it up so particles all right
[03:16:39] ready shot ready ready ready ready [ __ ]
[03:16:41] it we start wearing the heat up
[03:16:43] throw that Hydra
[03:16:46] casual press
[03:16:49] Let's Dance
[03:16:51] yeah
[03:16:53] 150. oh
[03:16:55] big number big number
[03:16:59] oh I wish I had a Shields like a charger
[03:17:02] better but sheesh
[03:17:05] like zhangly instead of Nikita here I am
[03:17:07] pogging so hard it's gonna be everywhere
[03:17:09] what the [ __ ] did I just say
[03:17:13] let's Light It Up
[03:17:16] we
[03:17:19] die can never slow Hydro would [ __ ]
[03:17:21] Bloom though because it's like I'm just
[03:17:23] dead I'm windy plant swirling man fallen
[03:17:27] leaves Adorn my Knights
[03:17:30] make yourselves at home
[03:17:34] yeah
[03:17:37] win strategy
[03:17:41] yeah
[03:17:43] next time Costco but I'm in uh Zhang Lee
[03:17:46] but I'll get it okay do this
[03:17:55] actually we might as well proc burning
[03:17:56] [ __ ] it more Pyro okay yeah I mean
[03:17:59] that's fine
[03:18:03] with
[03:18:07] it
[03:18:10] memories Wendy plants vloggers
[03:18:21] whoa
[03:18:24] swirled cryo yes this boss is actually a
[03:18:27] good that was a good demonstration of
[03:18:28] how you could have of the dendro and
[03:18:30] cryo interaction deadro and cryo can
[03:18:32] actually co-exist with one another which
[03:18:34] means you can have both at the same time
[03:18:35] on the enemy and it means that you're
[03:18:37] high you'll get more blooms per Hydro
[03:18:39] because the the hydro will be eaten by
[03:18:41] the freeze reaction and then a bit of
[03:18:43] the aura will go towards the bloom
[03:18:45] reaction uh the dendro which means Bloom
[03:18:47] and that means that each Hydro will
[03:18:50] remove less of the underlying dendro on
[03:18:53] the enemy which means more Bloom for
[03:18:54] hydro application true
[03:18:57] it's either more Bloom for hydro more
[03:18:59] balloon for dendro I forget about versus
[03:19:00] per Hydro might be Prudential I don't
[03:19:02] know you get the point
[03:19:04] actually it's probably pretty dendro
[03:19:06] because the dendro lasts longer but yeah
[03:19:14] I mean the prime
[03:19:18] dude I can't think the woo emote
[03:19:19] seriously
[03:19:31] what is he doing
[03:19:35] stay put quietly
[03:19:39] stand with me
[03:19:42] flicker
[03:19:45] sorry
[03:19:57] depressed
[03:20:06] uh usually would group them but we're
[03:20:08] like mid alt so I can't really stop
[03:20:12] she'll probably teleport to us with an
[03:20:13] attack anyways yes surely
[03:20:21] you can remove it if you want no I like
[03:20:23] it
[03:20:23] but it I think it's dumb
[03:20:37] having fun
[03:20:40] cool
[03:21:00] [Music]
[03:21:06] ducky
[03:21:16] should I wait till we can plunge attack
[03:21:20] just cause off his burst soon let's see
[03:21:22] uh
[03:21:24] okay
[03:21:33] teamwork history
[03:21:36] was gonna wear off no swirling swirling
[03:21:38] swordless swirling
[03:21:46] okay we need more pyro apps
[03:21:50] we need to burn we need to burn I didn't
[03:21:52] press the on the heater that's why I
[03:21:53] didn't press the on the heat on my bad
[03:21:54] my bad I forgot
[03:21:56] we needed burning true
[03:22:03] Ready Steady go what's wrong with this
[03:22:06] guy let the show begin yeah I've been
[03:22:09] wondering that for years now
[03:22:10] I don't think I even swirled Hydra by
[03:22:12] the way
[03:22:13] all good
[03:22:22] wait wait maybe we did swirl it because
[03:22:24] that's a lot of damage
[03:22:31] you did yeah I tried to but I didn't see
[03:22:34] the like the text of swirl but maybe I
[03:22:36] just missed it because there's a lot on
[03:22:37] screen
[03:22:39] because there's a moment where there's a
[03:22:40] hydro Aura and then a bunch of blooms on
[03:22:41] the ground so it looked like I could
[03:22:43] swirl it but then I didn't read it but I
[03:22:44] guess I just missed it
[03:22:45] like I think I hit it but I just didn't
[03:22:47] see it
[03:22:50] please you [ __ ] [ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ]
[03:22:59] I have no stamina
[03:23:07] easy
[03:23:13] Barbara deaf it's just that easy for
[03:23:15] Barbara it's too easy for Barbara you've
[03:23:17] reached the bottom of the Spiral Abyss
[03:23:20] I remember I remember seeing this text
[03:23:22] in 1.0 and being like Oh like I think it
[03:23:25] said 2
[03:23:25] B wait did it no I used to say to be
[03:23:27] continued I don't know I swear I would
[03:23:29] do this I was like oh there's gonna be
[03:23:30] more coming I can't wait
[03:23:33] wait it used to say to me or is that
[03:23:35] floor 8 or something I swear maybe that
[03:23:37] was four eight I don't know but I swear
[03:23:38] I used to say two he continued did it
[03:23:40] not
[03:23:43] definitely capping really to be
[03:23:45] continued
[03:23:46] spiral Abyss gentian
[03:23:55] foreign
[03:23:59] am I just hearing voices I swear it used
[03:24:03] to say that
[03:24:06] like there would be two screens there
[03:24:07] would be the complete and then another
[03:24:08] one
[03:24:15] zyox clears floor 12 clip
[03:24:31] a little also made out of this guy if we
[03:24:33] got a heart Abyss maybe best strategies
[03:24:35] for the new Abyss 1.5 what was the 1.5
[03:24:38] star of this let's see oh these
[03:24:40] [ __ ] so it is quite difficult I
[03:24:42] was playing Xiao venti down I mean
[03:24:44] that's not even bad you needed I don't
[03:24:45] know for the crowd probably show you
[03:24:46] guys some tips on how to make it as easy
[03:24:48] as possible for you and I want you guys
[03:24:50] to know that most of these strategies
[03:24:51] I'm gonna be showing are highly unknown
[03:24:53] and most people geez that you guys
[03:24:55] probably have killed at all
[03:24:59] can use cleanses with a hard time and
[03:25:01] they're annoying yo this is actually
[03:25:03] meta though because okay first of all we
[03:25:05] talk about TF Bennett I got a DM from
[03:25:07] some some person I genuinely don't know
[03:25:09] who they were I don't remember so I
[03:25:11] don't know but they were like hey man I
[03:25:14] actually came up with TF Bennett and no
[03:25:16] no no and then it was like they're like
[03:25:17] because I I think I credited like the
[03:25:19] Jeff for it because he told me about it
[03:25:20] and then they're like I actually made it
[03:25:21] up and then I checked and they were like
[03:25:23] is the Jeff talk about like literally
[03:25:25] like months before but anyways to push
[03:25:27] both of these dislikers together yeah
[03:25:29] there's Tina Bennett and then for the
[03:25:30] floor 11 where it was like made for
[03:25:31] ganyu
[03:25:34] sorry shot was talking uh you could play
[03:25:36] Chong Yoon with the [ __ ] prayers of
[03:25:39] Destiny so your hydro debuff for less
[03:25:41] Long that was actually met up
[03:25:45] why is it loading and um I am running
[03:25:48] the Talisman it doesn't last for that
[03:25:49] long see it just uh wore off and now if
[03:25:51] I press it it has a 14 second cooldown
[03:25:53] which is much less than 37. true and the
[03:25:55] way to see if you are hydroflifted or
[03:25:57] not right hand side and my characters
[03:25:59] died trying to explain this but it's
[03:26:00] fine if you look you see the hydro
[03:26:02] symbol under my facial that means that
[03:26:04] there's the debuff so if I press okay
[03:26:05] well
[03:26:07] the old arena
[03:26:10] yeah what was for 12 uh I guess it was
[03:26:13] the these guys wait let's look at all
[03:26:14] the enemies where all the enemies show
[03:26:16] me
[03:26:18] not everybody
[03:26:22] oh my God wait this is actually this was
[03:26:25] Loki this was cats this is not fun after
[03:26:28] the second half so I would highly highly
[03:26:30] recommend this is kind of disgusting
[03:26:32] wrongly if you have them if not Diana
[03:26:33] the free four star can also work wonders
[03:26:35] in the second half of 12-2 on your
[03:26:38] second team so that you don't die
[03:26:39] instantly now we're going to talk about
[03:26:40] Abyss 11 3 and how I manage to three
[03:26:42] start it uh using chongyang so no gonyu
[03:26:45] only Force our character oh man what
[03:26:46] else is there why is am I only showing
[03:26:48] that
[03:26:55] look like
[03:26:57] sheesh actually a lot actually a lot I
[03:26:59] still have this piece
[03:27:01] oh well it is
[03:27:06] back when you weren't washed what does
[03:27:08] that mean I'm not washed
[03:27:10] how am I washed
[03:27:13] those memories
[03:27:15] it's so dark
[03:27:16] okay but anyways I swear it used to say
[03:27:18] to be continued at the end of the Abyss
[03:27:21] floor 12 of my weapons are level one I
[03:27:23] asked myself like
[03:27:25] what was this of this
[03:27:27] I was the [ __ ]
[03:27:30] [ __ ] ruin graders
[03:27:33] did Imagine
[03:27:39] anyways
[03:27:42] watch that Envy video I guess Envy
[03:27:44] wouldn't have edited it out right maybe
[03:27:46] I'll see
[03:27:48] but what do you click continue would he
[03:27:50] click continue after
[03:27:54] you probably wouldn't click continue
[03:27:56] after clearing for 12.
[03:28:11] Chris and Pike shangling feel strong man
[03:28:24] it's over then lay a hand on me wait
[03:28:27] click continue please
[03:28:31] [ __ ] he doesn't click continue oh my God
[03:28:35] oh
[03:28:41] what are you doing
[03:28:46] yeah no one clicks continue
[03:28:50] dude is there no clip of someone just
[03:28:52] beating it basically can continue
[03:29:03] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:29:09] a full clear rotation to kill a hilly
[03:29:11] troll
[03:29:16] s
[03:29:25] yeah this event is pretty disgusting I

[03:35:07] beat next half
[03:35:09] oh no it's taking too long to kill
[03:35:13] sometimes like 25 seconds I don't think
[03:35:15] so
[03:35:23] fallen leaves Adorn disappear
[03:35:27] tear worthless
[03:35:34] I could change just use whichever one
[03:35:36] you have if you have both then see which
[03:35:37] one your other character needs more
[03:35:39] Miss splitter is more versatile
[03:35:41] because last characters less characters
[03:35:43] can use the em and whatever the [ __ ]
[03:35:45] Lo-Fi gives you like the EM conversion
[03:35:47] or whatever the [ __ ] it is
[03:35:48] so Adventure Time everybody
[03:35:53] you asked for it
[03:35:56] okay this is taking unironically too
[03:35:59] long why the [ __ ] did I put Daya here

[03:36:54] nice next floor next chamber I mean
[03:37:00] HSR later or not I really want to play

[03:37:41] was the minimum out of EML hide them
[03:37:42] needs 187 which is exactly as much as
[03:37:45] the fence that's not the real number but
[03:37:46] if you're not running em sounds and I'll
[03:37:48] hide them that's kind of weird
[03:37:51] so at least have a Sans and then go with
[03:37:53] some sub stats and focus on crit but

[03:58:19] I care if the Tory is evil I mean like
[03:58:21] yeah I don't condone his actions sure
[03:58:23] maybe he's a [ __ ] terrorist okay but
[03:58:26] let me play him
[03:58:28] foreign
[03:58:30] child good Clueless yeah I mean I think
[03:58:32] the the point is like the character can
[03:58:34] be evil but they have to like like the
[03:58:35] traveler or something because like try
[03:58:36] but like same with like Scarborough
[03:58:38] where he's like kind of redemption Arc
[03:58:39] but like he's also
[03:58:41] like not like he's committed crimes
[03:58:44] same with child same I know they're not
[03:58:46] the same but they're definitely
[03:58:47] criminals I mean klee's a terrorist she
[03:58:49] just doesn't know it yet
[03:58:58] let the mighty be humble
[03:59:02] oh
[03:59:03] thank you for being here
[03:59:05] isn't scar anymore
[03:59:07] yeah I can't wait for datori to have a
[03:59:10] good clone and then feeling like oh well
[03:59:11] it's a good clone he killed the Tory so
[03:59:13] he's not actually but a [ __ ] he's not
[03:59:16] a criminal because it's the Clone yep
[03:59:17] see guys it's not his fault
[03:59:22] wow how did you know
[03:59:29] but I don't want that to happen like if
[03:59:31] that's the way they make them playable
[03:59:32] then like at least he's playable but I
[03:59:35] would rather it just be he's evil but I
[03:59:36] can still play him I don't care every
[03:59:38] the year for my birthday he says me hate

[04:36:22] break these again oh I just okay
[04:36:27] oh my God I have to okay I need to do
[04:36:29] that all at once so yeah okay
[04:36:39] long stream dude random early stream
[04:36:42] after streaming last night and it's an
[04:36:44] early stream I mean and it's a long
[04:36:46] stream that's impressive
[04:36:48] four and a half hours sheesh
[04:36:52] I'm probably gonna end it here though
[04:36:54] but I want to do this more
[04:36:57] tomorrow
[04:36:59] I do a random valid stream unironically
[04:37:01] like sometime soon so that might just
[04:37:04] randomly happen if it does there will be
[04:37:05] a ping in my Discord for streams make
[04:37:07] sure you have that role uh it might be
[04:37:09] like
[04:37:10] I actually I'm not gonna say a day
[04:37:12] because I literally don't know it could
[04:37:13] be literally any time but at some point
[04:37:15] it might happen with that in mind thanks
[04:37:16] for watching I love you guys how do I
[04:37:18] get all those oars why is there no like
[04:37:23] that doesn't work right yeah where's the
[04:37:24] crab
[04:37:26] where's the crab steel doesn't work for
[04:37:28] that right
[04:37:29] um I want those oars
[04:37:36] jellyfish yeah but where I guess yeah we
[04:37:38] could go back in the jellyfish
[04:37:42] yeah so I'll probably work on some
[04:37:44] videos tomorrow uh figure out what I'm
[04:37:46] uploading I still have a few like old
[04:37:47] like Abyss videos to upload but I think
[04:37:49] they're bangers so I'm gonna do that
[04:37:52] um
[04:37:53] I also want to upload some guides I
[04:37:57] don't know which character guide I want
[04:37:58] to make I probably do the Luke at some
[04:38:00] point but I have to get ready for Risley
[04:38:02] I might do jingloo I haven't decided
[04:38:05] but can I open this I'm unfortunate
[04:38:08] why isn't even not it's not even giving
[04:38:10] me the option to open this
[04:38:16] oh buggers
[04:38:20] but yeah
[04:38:22] uh I also want to make some videos of
[04:38:24] like just like meme compilations but
[04:38:26] I'll probably on the second Channel and
[04:38:27] then main channel uh probably more
[04:38:29] there's gonna be the okay there's gonna
[04:38:32] be the me pulling versus Jake video it's
[04:38:34] gonna be the old Abyss video that needs
[04:38:35] to get uploaded and there's gonna be the
[04:38:37] uh Vermilion no the me spending a bunch
[04:38:40] of resin at Golden troop that's gonna be
[04:38:42] like a 30 minute video apparently like
[04:38:44] this one the new domain so probably it's
[04:38:45] gonna be long but it's gonna be bangers
[04:38:47] so be sure to check that when it comes
[04:38:48] uh the uid reviews is like turbo delayed
[04:38:51] but that one is gonna come out at some
[04:38:52] point and then we're gonna do Chris
[04:38:53] account reviews this week and then
[04:38:55] probably another GED review at some
[04:38:57] point and then away like interviews [ __ ]
[04:38:59] and the normal like guides but those
[04:39:01] have to work on off stream all also
[04:39:05] think of this idea I saw
[04:39:08] you know the like trend of like YouTube
[04:39:10] shorts where like they'll be like like
[04:39:13] it'll be like a girl being like
[04:39:14] here's five ways to impress any girl and
[04:39:17] then it cuts to like just someone
[04:39:19] talking about like a game like it'll be
[04:39:20] like the Geo guesser guy being like yeah
[04:39:22] this tree is [ __ ] this has to be
[04:39:24] Brazil and then like talk about it I was
[04:39:26] thinking of doing that but with like a
[04:39:27] rotate like talking about like a
[04:39:28] shangling rotation being like yeah and
[04:39:31] then just like edit it to be fast it's
[04:39:32] like yeah you don't try a lot of attack
[04:39:34] once in this off the bed at QE it's like
[04:39:36] compiling it I think dude just wait let
[04:39:39] me cook a little let me cook a little
[04:39:40] let me cook a little I think it'll be a
[04:39:42] banger
[04:39:43] anyways
[04:39:55] there's a 40 plus crew damage TF flower
[04:39:56] yours yeah I don't post chores of other
[04:39:58] people well if it's like a uid review
[04:40:00] yeah but like if it's a rolling a piece
[04:40:02] it's mine yeah
[04:40:03] at least for now you see I don't even
[04:40:05] think I'm I am using it it's on kitchen
[04:40:07] right now
[04:40:09] yeah so always roll your pieces that
[04:40:11] have four stats if one of them's good
[04:40:13] because this a lot of people would have
[04:40:14] thrown away because I don't need ER on
[04:40:15] kitchen but like and attack stocks the
[04:40:17] fan sucks
[04:40:19] but good damage
[04:40:23] we only got one I was chasing a piece
[04:40:25] like this since the day Genji came out I
[04:40:27] never had it until recently now we do

[04:41:46] we're ready to farm for now
[04:41:49] let's go there you want to watch him
[04:41:51] cook
[04:41:53] he's literally I don't even know what
[04:41:54] he's doing
[04:41:55] this guy has a Herman Miller in his
[04:41:57] kitchen
[04:41:59] this is literally a like thousand dollar
[04:42:01] chair in a kitchen what are you put that
[04:42:03] in your room bro
[04:42:05] those chairs are great they help your
[04:42:08] back I think they're worth it there's a
[04:42:09] 10 year warranty I I think they're good
[04:42:11] but why is it in your kitchen
[04:42:16] what up Rick we're actually ending gamer
[04:42:19] moment yeah I mean maybe you just moved
[04:42:20] it around but still it is funny
[04:42:23] did you break yours just the armrest
[04:42:24] it's still under warranty I called them
[04:42:26] they can fix it and I'm gonna give it to
[04:42:27] my brother because yeah it's literally
[04:42:29] right there it's I didn't break it
[04:42:35] the chair looks uncomfortable no it's
[04:42:37] actually really comfy it's really good
[04:42:38] for your posture too with that said I
[04:42:40] still look like a Hermit and like a
[04:42:41] banana
[04:42:56] get in here be nice to him no spoilers
[04:43:10] for 11 or 8 to 411 what does that even
[04:43:13] mean
[04:43:14] neither of us are 411 but also I'm
[04:43:17] genuinely like six times as height no
[04:43:19] disrespect there's nothing wrong with
[04:43:20] being short genuinely I'm just like
[04:43:22] objectively
[04:43:24] towering over that him also I was trying
[04:43:27] to order a new pair of shoes because I
[04:43:29] don't change shoes that often but like
[04:43:30] someone dude I wore like the same pair
[04:43:32] of shoes like Nikes for like two years
[04:43:34] and then someone I'd like like I posted
[04:43:36] a picture and someone was like they're
[04:43:38] time for new ones little bro because
[04:43:40] there's like creases on them which is
[04:43:41] normal so now I'm gonna order another
[04:43:43] one but I was ordering it I was like
[04:43:44] trying to like customize the color and
[04:43:46] every time I change something it looks
[04:43:47] worse so I had it's been like literally
[04:43:49] months that I can't pick one because
[04:43:50] every time not only am I indecisive but
[04:43:52] anytime I try to customize something it
[04:43:54] gets worse I don't know how I just keep
[04:43:56] making it worse I so
[04:43:58] I probably won't have it by like I don't
[04:44:00] know what's the next like twitchcon but
[04:44:01] eventually I'll have one so it is what
[04:44:03] it is
[04:44:04] anyways thanks for being here thanks for
