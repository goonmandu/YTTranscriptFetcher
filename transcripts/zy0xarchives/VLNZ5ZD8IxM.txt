[00:11:38] watch your stream today Nita guide very
[00:11:41] good watch it if you want uh the editing
[00:11:44] at like 30 seconds is
[00:11:47] scuffed because I said uh I mean I
[00:11:50] didn't really it it's whatever the
[00:11:52] editing is just scuffed but you won't
[00:11:53] really be able to I mean you can kind of
[00:11:54] tell but is what it is uh just cuz I
[00:11:56] said Hydro increases the mark instead of
[00:11:58] the burst but then I just cut it out in
[00:12:00] the editor which makes it sound weird
[00:12:02] but I'd rather make it sound weird than
[00:12:03] have to like explain that like hey it's
[00:12:06] actually the burst not the mark although
[00:12:07] I saw some I saw someone coping okay I
[00:12:10] for the record it doesn't do [ __ ] like
[00:12:11] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you
[00:12:13] use your burst once per rotation it
[00:12:14] doesn't matter how long your burst lasts
[00:12:15] you use it every rotation or you don't
[00:12:16] use it it's like at one point I said use
[00:12:18] it on cool down uh and someone was like
[00:12:21] well actually with Hydro you don't have
[00:12:22] to use it on cool it's like use it
[00:12:25] you're using it every 20 seconds or
[00:12:27] every 15 or every 25 you're not swapping
[00:12:29] at the Nikita mid- rotation to burst
[00:12:32] anyways and if you are don't talk to me

[00:47:02] if yes two if
[00:47:08] no I like this
[00:47:10] character uh I think I remember
[00:47:16] something I did see the Sentinels the r
[00:47:19] Sentinel
[00:47:22] Sentinel the senel in gingo
[00:47:26] there are one and six cities in Jingo
[00:47:29] which each City having its own Sentinel
[00:47:33] Sentinel okay so that's like the god I
[00:47:35] assume archon
[00:47:39] something form of a l like the stat you
[00:47:43] just saw okay
[00:47:47] Dragon I saw myself face to face

[00:47:58] dragon not the Sentinel my
[00:48:07] bad okay there's a skip button no this
[00:48:10] is autop play isn't it yeah it's
[00:48:18] Auto must be
[00:48:24] class no there will never be a
[00:48:28] okay I always would advocate for more
[00:48:32] options skip something if you don't want
[00:48:34] to I there is one according to the dev
[00:48:36] post oh my God this game might have done
[00:48:38] it so my take is I feel like a lot of
[00:48:42] goch games wouldn't do a skip button
[00:48:43] because they want you to see the
[00:48:44] characters that you're like attract
[00:48:46] attached to them and then you pull for
[00:48:47] them but if there is one
[00:48:52] she oh that was pretty cool that was a

[01:14:13] kind of
[01:14:15] cute okay uh for the record

[01:14:22] they're called I hate that every fre
[01:14:23] game uh that's fine what are these
[01:14:25] called I'll just say equipment I guess
[01:14:27] zigzag that is a little
[01:14:37] cringe okay um it's an echo echo ability
[01:14:41] I guess it is an echo training sword do
[01:14:43] I have other
[01:14:44] ones oh Tyro sword okay let's give it to
[01:14:47] her it's probably still mid but looks
[01:14:52] better what does f i don't have
[01:14:55] functions yet
[01:14:59] okay pretty cool oh I have a echo
[01:15:02] ability absorb Echo when
[01:15:06] it okay let me actually read this
[01:15:08] actually remaining frequency may become
[01:15:10] an echo echo is an important source of
[01:15:11] combat power if it is equipped in the
[01:15:13] first place it can also release its Echo
[01:15:15] skill oh yeah I know this just like the
[01:15:17] artifact
[01:15:20] thing yeah okay
[01:15:24] is that a [ __ ] lay
[01:15:26] line so it should be Q that's the echo I
[01:15:37] see all
[01:15:42] right all right
[01:15:47] absorb
[01:15:48] wait okay wait a second I don't get what
[01:15:51] the absorbing do so
[01:16:02] is it just to like use it more often
[01:16:04] like used
[01:16:07] artifact do I just need to absorb it so
[01:16:09] I could use it again like now if I get
[01:16:10] in combat can I use it Dragon bead what
[01:16:13] is
[01:16:16] this oh
[01:16:19] cool let me see if I'm in comat can I
[01:16:21] use it oh I can it just have to be on

[01:16:35] sense okay let's not fight that I'm
[01:16:37] sorry I'm sorry Turtle what is this
[01:16:41] Waypoint nice we got a
[01:16:45] beacon why is the turtle still attacking

[01:17:18] Us rewards right sure

[01:48:23] go to your mail and get free
[01:48:26] pull uh
[01:48:31] sure got a free
[01:48:33] tle chat remember when I was playing uh
[01:48:37] okay St uh okay uh okay uh okay uh [ __ ]
[01:48:41] it's a standard okay it's not
[01:48:43] event so when I was playing here's what
[01:48:47] happened here's the Z Lord in the beta
[01:48:49] of star rail I got claraa for free like
[01:48:51] the the guaranteed one I got was claraa
[01:48:53] I still don't have claraa in the main
[01:48:55] game uh
[01:48:58] in what and then when st came out I got
[01:49:01] cely in one single pull imagine no
[01:49:10] sorry encore's like doll things whatever
[01:49:13] the [ __ ] those are look cool I don't
[01:49:14] really care about the character that
[01:49:15] much but the the things she was holding
[01:49:17] look cool uh
[01:49:22] the guy on the right looks like Bennett
[01:49:24] or girl I think it's a guy but the
[01:49:26] person on the right looks like
[01:49:29] Bennett Jan's cool I mean we could just
[01:49:32] do a temple
[01:49:42] whatever I mean yeah there's nothing
[01:49:44] else to do with your standard pills
[01:49:46] right
[01:49:49] yeah
[01:49:54] that's pretty beautiful Force are though
[01:49:57] okay is that a weapon yeah those are
[01:49:59] weapons broad Blade Of
[01:50:09] Night wow Nova burst yes woohoo let's go
[01:50:16] nice I got a Nova burst I'm going to say
[01:50:20] it by the way so you know before I'm
[01:50:22] biased by what characters do I think
[01:50:24] guns in any game that has weapons that
[01:50:26] aren't guns is the objectively cringest
[01:50:29] [ __ ] weapon type to use I'm sorry I'd
[01:50:31] rather have a bow or a sword or a spear
[01:50:34] or a catalyst or a [ __ ] magical staff
[01:50:37] than a [ __ ] gun uh some games pull it
[01:50:40] off but that's just how I feel uh with
[01:50:43] that in mind we got a force our gun that
[01:50:44] I'm probably never going to use but
[01:50:45] Shang Ling uses guns so we're going to
[01:50:47] give her the uh Nova burst what does
[01:50:49] this do when a character dashes or
[01:50:51] Dodges the attack increases by uh by 4%
[01:50:53] sa up to three times this looks good on
[01:50:54] her because she dashes a lot her skill
[01:50:57] is a dash I don't know if that matters
[01:50:59] though might be dog [ __ ] let me look at
[01:51:01] the three star weapons I got I get
[01:51:02] anything for
[01:51:04] her
[01:51:07] W using resonance skill recover energy
[01:51:10] okay well that is probably going to be
[01:51:12] good attack nobody cares nobody cares
[01:51:15] she's a Healer all right we're going to
[01:51:16] use that what about her no I don't care
[01:51:18] about her what about her
[01:51:20] uh
[01:51:21] weapon
[01:51:23] attack hey energy maybe not for she
[01:51:26] looks like a DPS maybe she wants attack
[01:51:29] um this looks like zff would insta equip
[01:51:31] it and call me dumb for not using
[01:51:34] it
[01:51:35] however I'm going to go
[01:51:42] attack ain't no way
[01:51:48] fa
[01:51:51] wait what does my plunge look
[01:51:53] like
[01:52:02] oh that's
[01:52:07] cool I'm kind of sad that I did a temple
[01:52:11] cuz now it feels like what is the
[01:52:12] purpose of
[01:52:13] living I have to choose a weapon Target
[01:52:16] convene oh it's just like weapon
[01:52:19] permanent oh I see I don't think I'm
[01:52:21] ever going to pull on this surely uh but
[01:52:25] if I were
[01:52:26] to well these weapons look sick what the
[01:52:28] [ __ ] are these what weapon type is
[01:52:32] that like fists that looks
[01:52:39] cool yeah it's like double blades that
[01:52:41] looks really

[02:42:46] okay all good let me use my
[02:42:50] Q I'm worried that I might be dropping
[02:42:52] frames cuz I didn't restart my PC in
[02:42:54] like six days so if I stream this again
[02:42:55] tomorrow I'll be sure to
[02:43:07] restart no damage build I didn't level
[02:43:11] my fine fine I I wanted to pull first to
[02:43:14] see if I got a four-star weapon because
[02:43:15] if I level up
[02:43:17] okay I'm going to do something this is
[02:43:20] from 3 years of gotra
[02:43:23] experience I've only played like three
[02:43:25] but this is my years of experience okay
[02:43:27] I'm going to assume that for a DPS a
[02:43:29] four star sword will be a lot better
[02:43:31] than a three star one so the most future
[02:43:34] proof three star would be one that gives
[02:43:35] you utility and not attack not damage so
[02:43:38] I will level the one that gives energy
[02:43:41] because I assume that this might be more
[02:43:44] futureproof
[02:43:45] for my account than a a a DPS weapon I
[02:43:49] could be
[02:43:51] wrong but just in case so we're going to
[02:43:54] yink this cannot be performed during the
[02:43:56] battle okay yeah that's what I thought
[02:43:58] it's a beta I mean okay I guess it is a
[02:44:00] beta so I probably could just level it
[02:44:02] but you know what okay what does my all
[02:44:07] do that was pretty
[02:44:14] cool
[02:44:19] es Grizzly yep except lightning he's
[02:44:24] electric what is the type called in this
[02:44:26] game lightning thunder elect oh it's
[02:44:28] literally Electro okay
[02:44:29] cool that's easy to
[02:44:31] remember what's her element cryo glassio
[02:44:35] glasso how do I say that let me TTS

[02:52:03] there how's the mov comat feel so
[02:52:06] far it looks light ah okay I enjoyed the
[02:52:11] boss fight I did killing random enemies
[02:52:13] is just killing random enemies so I'm
[02:52:15] not sure yet but the so what I've heard
[02:52:18] and what I've seen from like 101 playing
[02:52:20] the first beta is that the actual boss
[02:52:24] fights look like they're actually
[02:52:25] challenging which is fun if it's true if
[02:52:27] it's not true and I mash buttons then
[02:52:30] that's a bit sad but I've heard that the
[02:52:33] combat's cool like it feels fine to play
[02:52:36] but I'm saying like I what I'm trying to
[02:52:38] say is like it depends on the enemies
[02:52:39] I'm fighting cuz like fighting like a
[02:52:41] random mob I could just mash my keyboard
[02:52:43] right but but I'm saying from what I
[02:52:46] have heard the actual bosses aren't like
[02:52:49] that which is cool like there's already
[02:52:52] parrying and stuff which I'm a God at
[02:52:54] what the
[02:52:56] oh okay I need to change my team
[02:52:59] though and you can plot on everyone

[03:50:40] what about this one heavy attack basic
[03:50:41] attack increases by 20% damage by 20%
[03:50:44] versus some attack so this one's

[03:50:49] heavy Dam residence residence skill is
[03:50:51] increased Stacks three times okay okay

[04:09:45] rhymes genin players when it's not twink

[04:10:03] dude the green
[04:10:06] guy
[04:10:08] H yeah I mean yeah I mean his arm looks
[04:10:12] bigger I don't know how he is in game
[04:10:19] though he looks a little bit more a
[04:10:22] little
[04:10:23] bit I'm going be you know I'm not going
[04:10:25] to look I've learned my lesson of
[04:10:28] overhyping a character's build uh after
[04:10:31] that height them
[04:10:36] incident
[04:10:38] can you drown in this
[04:10:47] game that's not a twink let me look at
[04:10:50] him now this guy okay okay look I don't
[04:10:53] know what his in-game model is like but
[04:10:55] he definitely has some form of
[04:10:58] musculature I get look I get it's not
[04:11:00] overly bulging but it's definitely
[04:11:03] definitely has uh one two 3 4 5 six
[04:11:07] seven eight
[04:11:09] ABS you tried him yeah but I didn't
[04:11:12] [ __ ] zoom into his
[04:11:15] model I probably should
[04:11:17] have uh how does that work probably need
[04:11:20] an item or some
[04:11:22] [ __ ] why is this one
[04:11:36] yellow
[04:12:06] bro oh okay you know what you you win
[04:12:08] this one you I don't even want that
[04:12:10] [ __ ] chest you win you
[04:12:12] [Music]
[04:12:16] win oh he's
[04:12:19] there okay not twink he's a twink but if
[04:12:22] he's hairy he's not bro what are you
[04:12:36] doing
[04:12:57] for I think he looks really cool from
[04:12:59] the
[04:13:06] back
[04:13:11] aboba it's good to see you here hey good
[04:13:14] to see you too
[04:13:36] man honestly similarly to sh this guy's
[04:13:39] pretty
[04:13:50] tall aboba it's a slow day please take a
[04:13:52] break and have some
[04:14:06] fun
[04:14:11] his hands are cool
[04:14:14] too or his right one I don't know I mean
[04:14:18] I don't know if they're
[04:14:36] different
[04:14:46] feel like their male models look better
[04:14:48] than the female models uh I think it's
[04:14:50] easy okay here's my take I think a lot
[04:14:53] of games get away with like any design
[04:14:58] on like a like a female character by
[04:15:00] just giving them massive milk cannons
[04:15:03] whereas for go like male characters they
[04:15:04] actually have to
[04:15:06] like design them more like I don't
[04:15:10] know sorry for describing it as such I
[04:15:13] think so there like I like the the
[04:15:16] character I don't know what her name is
[04:15:17] the one with like the white thing that
[04:15:18] like FS around I think that character is
[04:15:20] really cool visually uh but yeah I think
[04:15:24] a lot of their like male characters are
[04:15:26] just like pretty cool cuz they're I I
[04:15:28] don't know I feel like I don't even know
[04:15:30] how to describe this
[04:15:36] but I don't know I think this guy looks
[04:15:38] sick I also like scar a lot well okay to
[04:15:40] be fair to be fair I like that the like
[04:15:43] evil like the I don't know if they're
[04:15:45] villains but like the girl presented as
[04:15:46] a villain I think this character is
[04:15:48] [ __ ]
[04:15:49] sick uh let me show you I think this
[04:15:51] character like this character I think
[04:15:53] both of them guy and girl I think she's
[04:15:55] really cool I think that's my favorite
[04:15:56] one so far but like I feel like there's
[04:15:59] more to her design than just like look
[04:16:02] at my chest which I think is really cool
[04:16:04] uh him I don't know why he has a [ __ ]
[04:16:06] zipper but I really like
[04:16:08] him edgy 12-year-old I'm not a yo I just
[04:16:12] think she looks cool her design like
[04:16:15] Works her hair is cool her this game is
[04:16:18] kind of Kum AIT to the girls giant has a
[04:16:21] metal
[04:16:23] nipple Gian has a metal nipple I
[04:16:27] where okay but so does Captain Falcon
[04:16:30] he's my goat oh yeah he
[04:16:35] does
[04:16:53] aboba are you coming with me aboba aboba
[04:16:56] dly does a
[04:16:59] prime okay to be fair though to be fair
[04:17:03] I haven't seen a lot of the characters
[04:17:05] so I don't know who I actually like the
[04:17:08] most from the characters I have
[04:17:10] now okay honest rating from best to
[04:17:14] worst I think my favorite is I like her
[04:17:17] because of her like thing I I think I
[04:17:19] think she's my favorite and then him no
[04:17:21] maybe not him second ah one of these
[04:17:27] two I wish her eyes and hair were a
[04:17:30] different color oh no but her hair glows
[04:17:31] in the back okay I kind of like that I
[04:17:33] still think he's probably
[04:17:34] second I don't know she's one by like a
[04:17:37] landslide and then these two are pretty
[04:17:49] similar kind of like the main
[04:18:01] character but yeah these two are my
[04:18:02] favorite three for that I
[04:18:05] have

[05:00:12] this crownless draw resonator
[05:00:14] breakthrough item does that mean to
[05:00:16] ascend I assume it's to
[05:00:19] ascend he looks like he's a Havoc enemy
[05:00:21] so maybe it's for her how do I check
[05:00:23] what she needs to ascend it's probably
[05:00:26] for her I assume it's like her boss

[05:57:47] sky tour guide from the
[05:57:52] underworld astral Express true actually

[05:58:14] a random World
[05:58:16] quest uh how the [ __ ] do oh I just

[05:58:55] though oh this has the G where there's
[05:58:58] an ICD on your on your dashes you can do
[05:59:00] two but it the ICD is shared between
[05:59:02] characters so if I do dash dash then I
[05:59:04] swap I do it's not shared sorry it's
[05:59:06] independent for characters but it saves
[05:59:07] if you switch out so for example like
[05:59:09] it's paus when you switch so for example
[05:59:10] dash dash swap Dash wait what wait maybe
[05:59:14] not okay never mind it is
[05:59:17] shared okay it is shared it is
[05:59:20] shared yeah it's shared between
[05:59:21] characters okay it's
[05:59:25] different sh I
[05:59:30] manager aboba is
[05:59:40] here oh yeah it doesn't it doesn't stop

[05:59:50] have enough
[05:59:51] pulse that is not even close to enough
[05:59:54] well
[05:59:56] that
[05:59:58] what is
[06:00:00] this new Quest okay cool uh I will do a
[06:00:04] lot of those off stream what is this act
[06:00:06] level
[06:00:07] 14 uh what else Data Bank Tut resonates
[06:00:11] friends
[06:00:18] trophies no do
[06:00:26] this
[06:00:31] don't do off stream dance game I I'll do
[06:00:33] like the random ass like story like not
[06:00:36] story but like Side Story Quest off
[06:00:38] stream probably cuz like feel like it's
[06:00:40] less entertaining to stream like side
[06:00:43] quests
[06:00:45] [Music]
[06:00:48] um
[06:00:55] friends wait what else was I to
[06:01:15] do event I think we already claimed yeah
[06:01:19] we need to be 15 for five PS and then
[06:01:21] 400
[06:01:26] gems
[06:01:30] now we
[06:01:39] can't so I think it would have to
[06:01:41] [Music]
[06:01:42] be yeah this is definitely the next
[06:01:44] thing we
[06:01:49] do what parts of the combat are ping
[06:01:51] depended I'm not sure I'm actually not
[06:01:53] sure I know like genin a lot of the
[06:01:54] dodging is like client side so doesn't
[06:01:58] fully affect it but it affects like how
[06:01:59] you swap into characters and well it
[06:02:02] affects the dodging in the sense of like
[06:02:03] how you react to something coming to
[06:02:05] you uh like the timing is a bit it's
[06:02:08] like technically it's like the same
[06:02:09] timing but like it just visually looks
[06:02:16] different I don't know how to describe
[06:02:18] it on this game I'm not sure I'm playing
[06:02:20] on [ __ ] 40 ping so it's not
[06:02:26] bad
[06:02:34] first time chatter does this game have
[06:02:36] mommy characters bro look at my entire
[06:02:56] team
[06:03:05] how does the game feel so far I really
[06:03:07] like the combat exploration is pretty
[06:03:09] cool uh the rest I don't know some of
[06:03:12] the characters are sick some of them I
[06:03:13] don't care
[06:03:14] about uh but I'm like that a lot where
[06:03:17] like some characters I really like some
[06:03:18] I'm like I don't care uh I like the
[06:03:20] combat well I mean we'll have to
[06:03:26] see out the
[06:03:40] se you unlock the abyss equivalent
[06:03:42] that's actually a good question there's
[06:03:43] probably a lot of [ __ ] like that uh I
[06:03:45] think what I should
[06:03:52] do I actually don't know what I should
[06:03:56] do

[06:03:59] background because I need to do a

[06:21:17] probably read
[06:21:24] it
[06:21:28] what does my punch attack do here is it
[06:21:30] the
[06:21:31] same yeah it
[06:21:41] is burst energy oh is it but it shows

[06:23:17] sure okay I chose three Melodies what
[06:23:20] the [ __ ] are

[06:23:33] Target with the heavy attack and one
[06:23:35] Melody targ with the resonance skill one
[06:23:37] Melody tar with the intro skill one
[06:23:40] Melody we have three Melodies using a
[06:23:42] Bas midair will consume all melodies
[06:23:44] launch continuous attacks and die from
[06:23:45] midair causing Arrow
[06:23:49] damage I
[06:23:53] see okay so that's what it is
[06:23:56] is Jim may be feeding our eyes but you
[06:23:59] should consider getting some real food
[06:24:02] size I
[06:24:07] will accumulate and then wait what do I
[06:24:11] need to do to like spend them is it just
[06:24:13] in the

[06:24:19] alt if the resolve is higher than 30
[06:24:21] points it'll be consumed to Emerald
[06:24:23] storm finale heavy attack damage can be
[06:24:27] cast in the air so this my second alt I
