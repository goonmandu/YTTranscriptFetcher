[00:21:16] apparently there's a star rail on this
[00:21:17] now
[00:21:18] too well let's try it
[00:21:25] fan okay what about yanking
[00:21:29] okay that was a good guess though no it
[00:21:30] wasn't cuz they're both from the same
[00:21:32] [ __ ] place wait but who isn't from
[00:21:34] dude everyone's from there no no no no
[00:21:35] I'm trolling uh isn't Bao from like
[00:21:38] Dragon region whatever the [ __ ] that is
[00:21:45] called [ __ ] it let's do
[00:21:48] BYO she's from the same place I don't
[00:21:50] know Laura I don't know Laura I don't
[00:21:51] know L I know Dad hung has lore with her
[00:21:54] like I know there's like a backstory
[00:21:55] like Dad hung and biter and then like J
[00:21:57] Jing Le was like I'm going to torture
[00:21:59] you blade and then he's like I suffer
[00:22:01] but I didn't know okay all good all good
[00:22:03] it's fine we guessed three elements I'm
[00:22:05] just guessing the comma types I'm
[00:22:06] focusing on combat types okay I'm
[00:22:07] focusing on combat types let me think
[00:22:09] fire there could be like um uh uh uh uh
[00:22:12] uh uh where the [ __ ] is Asa from asa's
[00:22:14] from the [ __ ] she's she's in Hera's
[00:22:16] [ __ ] ship what is that a region I
[00:22:18] don't [ __ ] it
[00:22:23] ASA okay good guess though good good
[00:22:25] guess actually good guess cuz there's a
[00:22:26] new place and it's the right weekly boss
[00:22:28] and it's the right combat typee so the
[00:22:30] other Fire characters are heo and and
[00:22:32] and and CLE it could be CLE heo is uh oh
[00:22:36] but it could be either cuz there's no
[00:22:37] destruction either is it just himo I
[00:22:40] mean is it just H what if it's CLE I
[00:22:41] think it's CLE [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it
[00:22:44] [ __ ] it [ __ ] it this is my last guess
[00:22:46] though wait where is Hook from Hook's
[00:22:48] from the [ __ ] Hook's from the like
[00:22:50] underground region with like cely [ __ ]
[00:22:52] it it's CLE okay it was
[00:22:54] himo this game sucks okay anyways
[00:22:59] all right uh Geno that wasn't my fault
[00:23:01] dude it wasn't my fault it wasn't my

[00:48:03] true true literally true
[00:48:06] true nice try chat nice
[00:48:19] try why do you have 1990 resin because
[00:48:22] we literally showed you guys earlier
[00:48:24] however damage your Len deals gets
[00:48:26] converted to resin during this event
[00:48:27] it's a one- day thing only with Prime
[00:48:30] with prime
[00:48:31] gaming
[00:48:33] true the song hits yeah Uli played it in
[00:48:35] the car and I copyrighted I stole it I
[00:48:38] didn't tell him I saved it I just saved
[00:48:39] it and now I'm taking credit for
[00:48:47] it J the prime okay we have a lot to do
[00:48:50] today uh I might turn this into a second
[00:48:52] Channel video but we're kind of like Z
[00:48:54] is not Z [ __ ] Loki overcooked uh so I
[00:48:57] don't want to like overcook him but we
[00:49:00] have 2000 resin 1990 because uh I uh of
[00:49:04] the event that happened earlier which
[00:49:05] was uh the Linny event that gave me that
[00:49:07] resin uh you know if I'm going to travel
[00:49:11] I'm not going to spend resin without you
[00:49:12] guys so what we're going to
[00:49:14] do
[00:49:17] is spend this 1990 resin wisely I was
[00:49:21] thinking of chucking it all in an
[00:49:23] artifact domain but I think it would be
[00:49:26] smart if instead of doing that we
[00:49:29] prepped for rizzly who comes out
[00:49:32] literally Li c h t r i l e tomorrow
[00:49:38] and what better way to do that than Farm
[00:49:40] the boss mask that he's going to need
[00:49:42] and maybe the talent books that he's
[00:49:43] going to need as of right now we
[00:49:46] have 16 of his boss mats on and some
[00:49:50] Talent books whichever ones he need uh I
[00:49:54] think it's
[00:49:56] I actually don't remember but yeah
[00:49:57] anyways whichever one he needs uh and
[00:50:00] not SAS I actually don't remember which
[00:50:01] one he needs and we have 1.8 million
[00:50:03] Mora which is like nothing uh so we
[00:50:05] should probably be efficient and farm
[00:50:06] those
[00:50:11] things where it comes today for Asia for
[00:50:14] na it's in 16 hours so I'll be live
[00:50:18] again in 16 hours for those wondering
[00:50:20] can you guys see the timer yeah I'll be
[00:50:23] live when it's out on na
[00:50:26] Abyss 83 you fell off dude I it just
[00:50:28] reset what are you talking about it
[00:50:30] literally just
[00:50:43] reset anyways so we're going to be
[00:50:45] efficient but I also need to do uh this
[00:50:47] because our rizzly okay let's say we're
[00:50:50] gearing our Rizzy right uh I need to
[00:50:53] have a FR dead l
[00:50:56] oh [ __ ]
[00:51:00] Daydream
[00:51:04] cookie anyways because I need to get um
[00:51:07] my rizzly build
[00:51:09] ready to make sure our Rizzle cracked
[00:51:11] now I think our rli's cracked uh if you
[00:51:14] don't know oh what is Ry going to need
[00:51:16] how would I
[00:51:17] know there's no way to know but I can
[00:51:19] just
[00:51:24] guess
[00:51:33] wait why is this on him I don't know I
[00:51:35] guess I has
[00:51:36] HP I didn't know I had this good I've
[00:51:39] been trying to get a good attack sense I
[00:51:41] chat chat I roll this off stream right
[00:51:44] chat I roll this off
[00:51:50] stream let's just say we want a better
[00:51:53] Sans than
[00:51:54] that in an Ideal World we get a better
[00:51:57] sense uh
[00:52:00] also you know how I normally keep my
[00:52:02] character
[00:52:03] c0 yeah uh we'll talk about this next
[00:52:07] stream but let's just say uh I have a
[00:52:09] feeling I might get C1 let's just say
[00:52:11] that hello Mr say I might guess your day
[00:52:15] going would you like me to return your
[00:52:16] Lambo that you gave me the other
[00:52:24] day
[00:52:30] dude what the [ __ ] is
[00:52:37] this
[00:52:41] um you're on new video just hate yo Mia
[00:52:45] what the [ __ ] does that even mean what
[00:52:47] does that even
[00:52:53] mean true
[00:52:56] oh I'm sorry for hating
[00:53:09] Yia front load and backload damage I
[00:53:12] swear you asked this I swear I explained
[00:53:14] this to someone last
[00:53:16] stream okay front loaded damage
[00:53:19] okay hear me
[00:53:22] out okay front load of
[00:53:26] damage oh my God I have the best example
[00:53:30] I'm a genius I'm actually gen okay
[00:53:32] here's the difference between front
[00:53:34] loaded and backloaded damage and G imp
[00:53:35] back okay listen front loaded damage is
[00:53:38] like you pour your cereal and then your
[00:53:40] milk your cereal first and then your
[00:53:42] milk after because of that your cereal
[00:53:44] for the first like 5 minutes is the
[00:53:46] perfect balance of crispy while also
[00:53:48] being soaked with the milk and it's
[00:53:49] amazing and that's how you should eat
[00:53:51] cereal because it's front loaded near
[00:53:52] the end of the rotation the if you eat
[00:53:54] too slow your cereal will get soggy
[00:53:56] because you took too long and then your
[00:53:58] damage is no longer as good and then the
[00:54:00] start of the next rotation the wave two
[00:54:01] of cereal when you pour more and then
[00:54:03] add milk it's perfect because it's front
[00:54:05] loaded backloaded damage would be like
[00:54:07] pouring the milk first and then the
[00:54:09] cereal in that instance in that one sec
[00:54:13] in that instance uh uh uh because in
[00:54:15] fact at the start your cereal will just
[00:54:17] be like really dry because there's like
[00:54:18] no milk on it but a bit like if you take
[00:54:21] a bit longer to eat like maybe like 5 10
[00:54:23] minutes in then it'll be the more of a
[00:54:25] better ratio of of of cereal to milk
[00:54:28] whereas if you poured your cereal first
[00:54:30] it would start to get soggy by then
[00:54:31] which means that it's more
[00:54:45] backloaded okay I have to turn my Co-op
[00:54:54] off
[00:54:55] whoa someone asked if they should
[00:54:57] replace scour Atlas on their Scar and
[00:54:58] someone replied yeah SC Atlas is
[00:55:00] terrible whoa why is atlas terrible what
[00:55:03] the did I miss a memo what's wrong with
[00:55:06] Atlas you have a high base attack attack
[00:55:08] percent and then 12% ofal damage bonus
[00:55:10] Atlas is
[00:55:15] fine Al's pretty
[00:55:18] good can you give an example in genin
[00:55:21] okay child uh no not child Ula is very
[00:55:23] backloaded cuz you literally are just
[00:55:25] the NPC until your your burst
[00:55:28] is and then front loaded is
[00:55:31] like uh some like can like burst at the
[00:55:33] start of a rotation I don't know like
[00:55:35] witth witth is front loaded you have 10
[00:55:39] seconds of
[00:55:48] damage Ula is backloaded all right
[00:55:53] okay child this r that was the example I
[00:55:55] was going to go to but I don't
[00:56:03] know okay let's go to the
[00:56:07] boss what about snapshotting okay you
[00:56:09] know what snapshotting is I'm not

[00:58:16] sharp right and at 12:01 you're late but
[00:58:19] you submitted at 1200 but then there's
[00:58:22] like processing time and by the time it
[00:58:25] gets your teacher it's 12:05 okay if
[00:58:27] your submission snapshotted then it
[00:58:28] would be submitted at 1200 and you'd be
[00:58:30] fine okay it' be submitted at midnight
[00:58:32] or like 11:59 and you're good okay but
[00:58:34] if it didn't snapshot then it would only
[00:58:36] be submitted after it processed at 12:03
[00:58:40] and then you would be disqualified and

[01:09:03] rizle is gonna dude dude dude dude dude
[01:09:05] he's GNA
[01:09:08] dude I actually okay I would like to
[01:09:12] submit a legal complaint about Mari
[01:09:15] chose not like it shouldn't be in the
[01:09:19] game cuz m is literally like just a
[01:09:22] better Vermilion
[01:09:24] so it's like I dude I not for Shia but
[01:09:27] like in general one year aware dude did
[01:09:30] I tell you guys okay I tweeted this but
[01:09:33] it actually happened so I'm going to say
[01:09:34] it again someone at [ __ ] New York
[01:09:36] Comic-Con I swear to God someone came up
[01:09:39] to me and literally just all he said he
[01:09:41] didn't say hi he didn't stop he didn't
[01:09:44] do anything he just came up to me he
[01:09:45] said where's the Delo guide and then
[01:09:48] walked away I swear literally that's it
[01:09:51] he just I didn't even get to look at him
[01:09:52] he just said that walked
[01:09:56] away now I feel now I like I felt called
[01:09:58] out thank you
[01:10:03] for so I guess we have to do the loot
[01:10:05] guide now honestly there's like I'll
[01:10:08] probably wait till after finina cuz I
[01:10:10] assume you can play du I I don't know
[01:10:13] what the [ __ ] she does but she's the
[01:10:14] Hydra archon so you probably can play
[01:10:16] duuke with
[01:10:17] her so we'll
[01:10:19] see S no like
[01:10:22] actually so we
[01:10:31] wait
[01:10:37] okay I might have to make two videos
[01:10:39] about her like I'll make a Fina guide
[01:10:42] and then I might have to make another
[01:10:44] video about her if she's actually
[01:10:47] like if she exploits font 10 mechanics
[01:10:50] the way I think she will just logically
[01:10:53] then I might have to make another video
[01:10:57] too okay cuz I want to talk about this
[01:11:00] but you guys seem to think it's leaked
[01:11:01] every time I talk about it but like I
[01:11:03] swear I haven't looked at them so this
[01:11:04] is just like what I assume she'll do
[01:11:06] okay I'm not joking by the way okay
[01:11:09] every [ __ ] mechanic in font 10 is
[01:11:10] like oh if you [ __ ] your HP sideways
[01:11:13] then you gain damage so I assume she'll
[01:11:15] [ __ ] with your HP like I'm not dude I've
[01:11:17] thought about this for like a year
[01:11:19] before there's even any chance of being
[01:11:21] Sask okay so I'm just saying if she does
[01:11:24] [ __ ] with your HP then that means that
[01:11:26] in each guide I make ever I'm going to
[01:11:28] have to include a 30 second section
[01:11:30] saying oh and you can probably run Mar
[01:11:32] Jose or vermil or like well hopefully
[01:11:34] Vermillion I don't please please
[01:11:38] please please let me run ver million on
[01:11:40] everyone dude imagine

[01:14:44] few days it's a banger I'm not going to

[01:14:48] though yeah I see the value in my own
[01:14:52] there's a banger but I also see the
[01:14:54] meaning in all the Endeavors of the
[01:14:56] people
[01:14:57] of okay I believe I will continue to
[01:15:00] take pride in fulfilling my
[01:15:03] sorry did I miss anything no that's it
[01:15:07] oh yeah okay I said I'm not going to
[01:15:08] name who did it but I'm going to name
[01:15:10] them dude I literally was okay I was
[01:15:12] talking to Fang right and she literally
[01:15:14] I swear to God she was like talking to
[01:15:16] me about like rizzly I'm like yeah like
[01:15:17] I we don't know yet but I assume you
[01:15:19] know he'll probably be good with like
[01:15:20] shenhu he's cryo and like shenhu and
[01:15:22] like buff stuff and then she was like
[01:15:25] really why would you run two five star
[01:15:27] cryo characters
[01:15:30] together so I was like d that's that's
[01:15:33] wholesome like I I wish I had that level
[01:15:37] of grass touching I wish I wish that's
[01:15:39] how I thought too it makes sense if you
[01:15:42] like don't think about it it makes sense
[01:15:44] be
[01:15:45] humble is Fang still in chat she
[01:15:47] probably left
[01:15:52] silence
[01:15:54] you [ __ ] oh hey hey hey
[01:16:06] Fang dude I actually started like I
[01:16:09] didn't even answer her question she
[01:16:10] asked and I just started laughing I feel
[01:16:12] like an [ __ ] I didn't even answer her
[01:16:13] question I didn't even explain why sheno
[01:16:15] would be good with a crowd
[01:16:17] character
[01:16:22] anyways
[01:16:24] it wasn't mean it was
[01:16:27] just why you're on Shena over
[01:16:32] Mika stop stop stop you're doing as the
[01:16:38] Jeff right now stop it stop it stop
[01:16:47] it to be fair M's good what do you mean
[01:16:51] stop stop he is at best okay
[01:16:57] viable in like two teams he doesn't know
[01:17:00] yes I do know he gives you attack speed
[01:17:02] and burst healing and Crow resonance
[01:17:04] cool do you know who gives you more than
[01:17:07] that
[01:17:09] Bennett I'm not even
[01:17:12] joking just benett
[01:17:19] alt benett in cryo okay
[01:17:26] so he's
[01:17:31] Bennett benett won't work with
[01:17:34] rizle surely surely he
[01:17:38] won't unless you guys are thinking like
[01:17:40] way in the future and you're like oh
[01:17:41] with the archon but if you're pulling
[01:17:43] for the archon for a character who needs
[01:17:44] the archon to be viable then you're
[01:17:46] weird sorry that was toxic we don't know
[01:17:52] yet
[01:17:57] no but we've seen what rizy like mostly
[01:17:59] does and he's out in three hours I I'm
[01:18:02] going to say from now there's no way he
[01:18:03] doesn't work with Ben
[01:18:14] it be
[01:18:21] sanctified
[01:18:24] is it what you wish to find are you
[01:18:25] going to wait for his Banner uh we're
[01:18:27] going to stream the na release which is
[01:18:29] in 16 hours Asia's when when is the Asia
[01:18:33] release like 12 hours
[01:18:36] maybe has at least made it a like sorry
[01:18:39] like 12 for us remaining so that would
[01:18:40] be in like three or four three four
[01:18:46] three okay makes sense would I still be
[01:18:49] live by then I don't know
[01:18:51] maybe
[01:18:55] okay makes sense makes sense makes sense
[01:18:58] let me go do a few artifact runs while I
[01:18:59] think we have a lot of resin to go
[01:19:09] [Music]
[01:19:20] through this is an osrs dude you haven't
[01:19:22] even been playing you can't rast me if
[01:19:24] you haven't been playing hello
[01:19:28] though how you how you
[01:19:31] doing also I
[01:19:34] okay unless your teammates are HP
[01:19:37] scaling which might be HP which might
[01:19:39] happen in the future not Suk then I
[01:19:41] can't see a world where you don't just
[01:19:43] put Bennett with rizzly by the way like
[01:19:45] even in a freeze team you don't you
[01:19:46] wouldn't have to but you could run like
[01:19:48] cuz you if he's a normal attacker which
[01:19:50] we can tell that he is by what how he
[01:19:52] looks like you probably want s trro and
[01:19:53] then why wouldn't you run Bennett with
[01:19:55] them unless you're like swirling [ __ ]
[01:19:57] hydro and cryo which anyways let's not
[01:19:59] talk about it but like even Benet
[01:20:00] doesn't even ruin your [ __ ] freeze
[01:20:02] cuz you just press q and then you swap
[01:20:03] and it's one [ __ ] app of pyro see you
[01:20:06] soon yes see you soon I assume you're r
[01:20:07] a twitch con
[01:20:13] right
[01:20:21] pogers why did de Auto attack not work
[01:20:24] with sing Cho cuz they hate

[01:21:11] fine okay cuz I didn't think I was going
[01:21:13] but then there's like something I could
[01:21:15] like now I have a reason to go so but
[01:21:18] like when I checked it like a week ago
[01:21:20] the the like I was like wow this is
[01:21:21] expensive so I want to book it and now
[01:21:23] it's like the same it didn't actually go
[01:21:24] up in like 5 days it's like the same so
[01:21:26] it's not like I lost anything I just am
[01:21:28] in denial and I don't want to book it
[01:21:30] Comm to memory
[01:21:32] silence dude I have to
[01:21:42] go it's
[01:21:46] fine Pepe W with me millionaire dude I
[01:21:51] literally okay forther the record I
[01:21:53] barely break even on trips I think I
[01:21:56] actually on average lose money I just go
[01:21:58] to meet people I'm not even kidding
[01:22:01] Bennett Q constantly apply pyro what we
[01:22:04] were talking about that like 30 minutes
[01:22:06] ago this are you a mobile how is it so
[01:22:09] delay we're not talking about that also
[01:22:11] that's not even
[01:22:12] true Bennett's burst
[01:22:16] doesn't it it applies it to you like
[01:22:19] you're infused
[01:22:21] with
[01:22:33] maybe if you play Gan maybe if you're
[01:22:35] trying to like Sunfire yeah yeah you're
[01:22:37] playing Sunfire
[01:22:41] true settle
[01:22:43] down the Temple of
[01:22:48] wisdom can the med touch on parasocial
[01:22:53] what does that even
[01:22:55] mean
[01:22:59] Sil the time
[01:23:02] be but yeah uh hopefully MAA works with
[01:23:07] with with
[01:23:09] characters I will say a lot of times
[01:23:12] when a character is like underused and
[01:23:14] gets a viable team with a new character
[01:23:16] it's like really cool for that character
[01:23:18] to have another team but people also
[01:23:20] tend to like overhype it for no reason
[01:23:22] cuz a character that had no teams gets a
[01:23:24] team a good example of this is like yo
[01:23:27] Mia with any character that's not no
[01:23:28] sorry sorry wrong wrong uh F okay you
[01:23:31] never let [ __ ] a yunen with any
[01:23:33] character that's not yoia where like
[01:23:35] with yoia she's good and with like most
[01:23:36] other normal attackers it's like you can
[01:23:38] but like

[01:28:54] pretty sure I use Bennett in like the
[01:28:55] next
[01:28:57] video I'm pretty sure I know this video
[01:29:00] has been it like all of these videos
[01:29:01] have Ben

[01:29:13] bad team and then my good team had
[01:29:17] Noel
[01:29:20] anyways
[01:29:23] your Noel is the same
[01:29:26] level look look October 18 Noel level 40
[01:29:30] look look at this look at this look at
[01:29:32] this
[01:29:37] shees no that's been three
[01:29:40] years I think every other character went
[01:29:42] up in level I'm not even joking every
[01:29:44] single other character leveled up I'm
[01:29:46] pretty
[01:29:50] sure
[01:29:54] um that's actually
[01:29:59] crazy Chad you want to see do you guys
[01:30:01] want me to get one Primo Jam right now
[01:30:03] look I can get one Primo Jam you ready
[01:30:06] look look I can get one Primo Jam in 30
[01:30:08] seconds watch
[01:30:10] watch watch I can get one Primo Jam
[01:30:13] watch
[01:30:20] this wait do I even want to make that am
[01:30:23] I ever going to use this I don't
[01:30:34] know
[01:30:37] no uh I need to use a skill right wait
[01:30:42] when the [ __ ] did I get a bond of life
[01:30:43] before I thought that was going to give
[01:30:45] me
[01:30:46] a I already got it no bond [ __ ]
[01:30:54] the foule enemies
[01:30:56] oh wait why did I just craft it I tried
[01:30:59] to get a Primo I'm sorry dude I actually
[01:31:02] tried to get a Primo gem I mean oh the
[01:31:04] pages look cool though wait yo this
[01:31:07] looks sick okay I don't regret it this
[01:31:08] thing's cool this thing's cool I like it
[01:31:11] I think it looks cool and it's also
[01:31:12] pretty good it's
[01:31:17] fine cope it's actually good you get up
[01:31:19] to R5 you get up to 40% Elemental damage
[01:31:24] I saw people mentioning how this
[01:31:25] wouldn't work with Bennett because you
[01:31:27] uh at over 70% HP Bennett wouldn't heal
[01:31:29] you so he wouldn't be able to get the
[01:31:30] bond of Life buff on like characters
[01:31:32] like scar or whatever but if your
[01:31:33] catless character consumes his own HP
[01:31:35] not Suk by the way but if he does then
[01:31:37] it should still work anyway so it
[01:31:39] doesn't matter unless I'm wrong but like
[01:31:42] cuz I saw some people explaining how
[01:31:44] this would be bad but I don't think it
[01:31:45] would be bad unless like either I'm dumb
[01:31:48] or they're dumb and usually I'm the dumb
[01:31:49] one but I feel like I'm not but I'll
[01:31:51] test
[01:32:14] it does the event books seem good I
[01:32:16] talked about that in my weapon review
[01:32:18] video but tldr yes it does seem good
[01:32:21] it's just hard to that's not the event
[01:32:24] okay I why do I have a royal grimore I'm
[01:32:27] sorry I'm sorry it's R5 I'm
[01:32:31] sorry the event weapon seems good the
[01:32:33] only problem is that it gives you energy
[01:32:35] recharge which most DPS catalysts can't
[01:32:38] use despite that it's still pretty good
[01:32:42] it's just there's often times better
[01:32:43] options but it's
[01:32:45] decent let's go do the boss
[01:32:50] that
[01:32:56] Proto better depends on for who for nlet
[01:32:59] if that's what you're asking uh amber is
[01:33:00] usually a bit better so they're both
[01:33:02] fine they're both good options and if
[01:33:03] you don't have like one level you don't
[01:33:05] have the prototypes you can use ballad
[01:33:07] the only thing is often times um Amber
[01:33:10] will be better
[01:33:12] because uh it averages out to a bit more
[01:33:14] DPS overall and you also get uh a bit of
[01:33:17] healing for your team and also some
[01:33:19] energy so it saves you energy recharge
[01:33:21] and it gives a bunch of HP but both are
[01:33:29] fine proyer battle pass weapon battle
[01:33:31] pass weapon but it's they're both good
[01:33:33] like yeah battle pass weapon especially
[01:33:36] with I was going to say with refinements
[01:33:38] but it's new you can only have like R2
[01:33:40] at this point so yeah B pass weapon is
[01:33:41] good but only for him I don't think
[01:33:45] there's any other character right now
[01:33:46] that can use this other than him or like
[01:33:48] [ __ ] crit
[01:33:50] Comey
[01:33:55] bow
[01:33:57] your de with
[01:34:04] me
[01:34:07] drop
[01:34:12] silence fine we'll do another Shaw wait
[01:34:15] let me get
[01:34:19] it why isn't he doing it
[01:34:36] oh the now the new banners wait I didn't
[01:34:38] see them wait what are the new banners
[01:34:40] where are they oh wait there's Dory I
[01:34:42] remember okay I remember seeing
[01:34:44] it wait did I did we look at it on
[01:34:47] scream I feel like I didn't on stream I
[01:34:48] mean I don't think I did but I remember
[01:34:49] seeing it somewhere where the [ __ ] is is
[01:34:51] it how long ago is it we didn't see it
[01:34:59] right October 12 did we I can't remember
[01:35:04] anyways new banns in case you're
[01:35:07] wondering let's look at them okay so
[01:35:09] there's rizley he looks sick I [ __ ]
[01:35:11] love him we'll see if he's good or not
[01:35:13] no comment for now but there's him four
[01:35:20] stars
[01:35:22] okay let's start with the good then
[01:35:24] we'll get to the bad and then we'll get
[01:35:25] to the ugly Toma actually has really
[01:35:28] good constellations notably his C6 okay
[01:35:31] Toma goes went from a unit that no one
[01:35:33] really cared about to being better with
[01:35:35] Virgin to being even better now when you
[01:35:38] have a C6 in either Shia or scar teams
[01:35:41] potentially being in their best comps or
[01:35:43] yeah because farzon and Bennett often
[01:35:47] times will need a battery so like okay
[01:35:50] farzon cz's energy gen is so [ __ ]
[01:35:53] terrible that you either want another
[01:35:54] anemo or Toma on fav who can generate a
[01:35:57] lot of energy power energy for your
[01:35:58] benit as well and if you have them C6
[01:36:01] then other than just the energy and even
[01:36:03] if you have fars on C6 it can be good
[01:36:05] because you get normal charge and pl
[01:36:07] attack damage which the first two are
[01:36:08] great for Scara and the last one is
[01:36:10] great for sha also he can actually be
[01:36:12] better than Jang Lee sometimes with sha
[01:36:14] because you don't need MTH on Jong Le if
[01:36:17] your far is on C6 and is running
[01:36:19] MTH so yeah
[01:36:22] Toma with cons can actually be pretty
[01:36:24] POG but only in like specific teams he's
[01:36:26] still not like broken but
[01:36:29] yeah Chong
[01:36:33] Yun
[01:36:48] Dory dude listen listen listen listen uh
[01:36:51] I don't know what to say about this
[01:36:54] okay um Dory is like if you got okay
[01:36:59] Dory is like if you're like oh Mom can I
[01:37:01] have Kookie and then she's like we have
[01:37:03] cookie at home and then it's
[01:37:06] Dory Chong Yun is
[01:37:10] cool but there are very few situations
[01:37:13] where I'd use him over like Kaa who's
[01:37:15] free or
[01:37:17] Rosario the main thing I like about
[01:37:19] Chong Yun the main aspects that I like
[01:37:21] are his C2 which gives cooldown
[01:37:23] reduction and his attack speed from his
[01:37:26] passive
[01:37:36] Talent uh
[01:37:40] veny moving on weapon
[01:37:49] banner I mean okay
[01:37:54] okay El is insane I love El um do we
[01:37:58] know what Casa does did they show
[01:38:11] it where is it I feel like they showed
[01:38:14] it where is it sorry sorry I'm sorry I'm
[01:38:18] sorry man let me look it up
[01:38:21] cash flow
[01:38:28] supervision wait the wiki has its stats
[01:38:30] so it has to be confirmed somewhere
[01:38:32] where the [ __ ] did they show it
[01:38:39] oh okay well now that we know that it
[01:38:41] showed it I can tell you what it does
[01:38:43] what the [ __ ] how does he 674 base
[01:38:45] attack 22 crit rate increases your
[01:38:47] attack by I think 16% normal and charge
[01:38:50] attack damage I believe it's like 48
[01:38:51] normal attack and 42 charge attack on
[01:38:54] top of also giving you attack speed when
[01:38:55] fully
[01:38:56] stacked what
[01:38:58] sorry anyways yeah so you get yeah yeah
[01:39:02] so yeah uh so
[01:39:11] yeah so that's what Cas supervision does
[01:39:14] um you might be like what the [ __ ] how
[01:39:15] is it so much uh uh damage it's cuz it's
[01:39:17] 16 * 3 or 14 * 3 which should be 48 and
[01:39:21] 42 but my math sucks so if I'm wrong say
[01:39:23] I'm wrong uh and then you also get 8%
[01:39:25] attack speed and 86% attack crit rate
[01:39:27] and base attack now this also confirms
[01:39:29] by the way if you don't know that not
[01:39:31] only does he scale on attack because
[01:39:32] attack perc increase for a character
[01:39:34] also um it shows that you're going to
[01:39:36] [ __ ] with your HP because it says when
[01:39:38] increases or decreases and I assume
[01:39:41] slash I know slash it's for sure that
[01:39:43] you're going to stack this very easily
[01:39:45] so boom um yeah this weapon looks good
[01:39:48] for him uh you can also use it on
[01:39:52] like assuming Fontan is going to make
[01:39:54] you able to lose your
[01:39:57] HP uh if you can use the normal charge
[01:39:59] attack Buffs it's really
[01:40:01] good like Scara but we'll see um someone
[01:40:06] asked if the 22 crit rate is low yes but
[01:40:08] it's because you have a high base attack
[01:40:10] cuz this is the same as the bell like
[01:40:12] the scars Bell which is 674 base attack
[01:40:14] but uh 44.2 crit damage it's really high
[01:40:18] base attack like the highest like the
[01:40:20] look it's the same as
[01:40:21] Aquilla right so it's like a really
[01:40:23] really high base attack five star
[01:40:24] where's Aquilla where's Bennett boken
[01:40:26] the boken yeah see but and then you have
[01:40:29] the like lower
[01:40:31] stat nerd is actually 44.1 crit damage
[01:40:34] wait really wait so this is just
[01:40:35] objectively
[01:40:37] better t
[01:40:40] t it should be 44.2 unless this weapon
[01:40:43] just power creeps
[01:40:47] it what the [ __ ] is this okay I'm
[01:40:51] where's the weapon
[01:40:58] I wait it's actually power creep okay
[01:41:03] well anyways so yeah
[01:41:08] um so yeah as I was saying assuming your
[01:41:10] HP does go up and down all the time uh
[01:41:13] first of
[01:41:16] all yes you can use M but don't expect
[01:41:19] them to be like a god
[01:41:21] I've seen the the overhyping and second
[01:41:23] of
[01:41:24] all second of
[01:41:27] all second of
[01:41:32] all second of all I forgot what I was
[01:41:35] going to
[01:41:40] say I don't know Chad do you think it
[01:41:42] looks cool I think it looks why does it
[01:41:44] give me a penguin Vibe I think it looks
[01:41:45] both cool and ugly at the same time um
[01:41:48] yeah it it is what it is
[01:41:52] it seems either not versatile at all or
[01:41:56] versatile if you can manipulate your HP
[01:41:59] depending on what Fontan gives us with
[01:42:01] future characters okay we don't know no
[01:42:02] leaks I'm just saying um but yeah attack
[01:42:05] normal and charge attack damage so
[01:42:07] pretty good um four characters that use
[01:42:09] that and you also get attack
[01:42:11] speed why is it power creep that's just
[01:42:12] a joke because it's 0.1 crit value
[01:42:16] more okay next up we have range
[01:42:19] gauge I love that name range
[01:42:25] gauge wait what the [ __ ] does range
[01:42:27] gauge do yeah have 565 base attack
[01:42:29] that's good high base attack with a low
[01:42:31] attack percent is a lot better than the
[01:42:33] opposite um when you're healed you gain
[01:42:36] symbols up to three symbols what the
[01:42:38] [ __ ] this doesn't
[01:42:40] help for each symbol consumed gain 3%
[01:42:43] attack Elemental damage bonus you can
[01:42:45] get up to
[01:42:47] three so I assume this is times two at r
[01:42:50] five and then * 3 when it's fully
[01:42:51] stacked so 6 * 3 would be 18% attack 7 *
[01:42:56] 2 would be 14 * 3 48 am I good at math
[01:43:00] maybe 42 42 not 48 42
[01:43:03] 42 yes 42 42 Elemental damage on us
[01:43:05] that's actually a
[01:43:08] lot this is probably
[01:43:11] fine what is this prospector's drill oh
[01:43:15] same thing okay they're literally the
[01:43:18] same uh who who the [ __ ] would I use
[01:43:21] this
[01:43:25] on wait this is a gacha weapon
[01:43:30] though I assumed R5 cuz I was like I
[01:43:33] don't know freet to play but I just
[01:43:34] realized it's a gacha weapon so you're
[01:43:36] probably not going to R5 it so at R cuz
[01:43:38] if you r five it you're going to get a
[01:43:39] [ __ ] five star at that point probably
[01:43:41] so
[01:43:43] R1
[01:43:44] yeah I mean it's a decent stat stick but
[01:43:47] they're nothing like
[01:43:49] insane
[01:43:51] I mean Shia could use this right wait a
[01:43:53] second 565 base attack wait a
[01:43:58] second
[01:44:01] lament for Shang
[01:44:11] Ling dude cuz massive windspear is
[01:44:13] literally first of all a worse stat line
[01:44:15] cuz High base attack is better and then
[01:44:18] um 24% attack here whereas this one will
[01:44:20] give you 3 * 3% attack so nine which
[01:44:24] isn't the
[01:44:28] most although is it can you consistently
[01:44:31] get this you'd have to use a skill mid
[01:44:32] burst first rotation you have to use a
[01:44:35] skill mid burst and then 7% times three
[01:44:38] is 21 which is pretty yeah it's actually
[01:44:41] pretty
[01:44:42] decent there you go new sh
[01:44:48] weapon anyways
[01:44:52] with that in mind the
[01:44:54] banners El's busted cash flow is good on
[01:44:57] a few characters notably rizzly and pro
[01:44:59] maybe Scara but you have to like
[01:45:00] manipulate your HP but anyways and then
[01:45:03] the the new the new two weapons seem
[01:45:05] fine depending on what alternatives you
[01:45:07] have like they don't seem like broken
[01:45:09] bro I'm going insane I'm sorry what the
[01:45:11] [ __ ] is
[01:45:15] this Blue's
[01:45:17] theories furina definitely has an arch
[01:45:20] look about her why with their hydr
[01:45:22] colored streaks of hair oh wait anyways
[01:45:28] uh yeah so these two five stars are like
[01:45:31] L is pretty cracked Cas could be good
[01:45:33] and then the two new four stars are like
[01:45:34] decent but you might have better options
[01:45:36] but they seem pretty decent but they're
[01:45:37] also gotra exclusive so I don't expect
[01:45:38] people to have refinements uh F sword is
[01:45:41] broken eye of perception doesn't exist
[01:45:43] and then rain slasher is like okay but
[01:45:45] it's been so long that you probably have
[01:45:47] a better Claymore for like any character
[01:45:49] but it's like fine on C current on
[01:45:54] characters right bad don't butter it up
[01:45:57] h i mean if you may rizzly his weapon's
[01:46:00] honestly like not bad at
[01:46:03] all his weapon is a really good upgrade
[01:46:06] for him and eleg is a really good
[01:46:08] upgrade for characters that need uh uh
[01:46:12] like any support ever it's just the four
[01:46:15] stars are kind of whatever although five
[01:46:17] star is really
[01:46:19] good
[01:46:23] so
[01:46:34] yeah yeah L is really good to have I
[01:46:37] really like
[01:46:39] ly if I if I had to pull for El or Aqua
[01:46:42] for like yolan it's always LG like every
[01:46:45] day of the week and then you can also
[01:46:46] use it it literally makes characters
[01:46:47] that you would never use otherwise
[01:46:48] usable like Amber with ly becomes like a
[01:46:51] an
[01:47:07] option L SAR best SL dud L is like
[01:47:10] everyone's potential best in slot L and
[01:47:13] and uh Freedom sorn are good as like on
[01:47:15] like basically any character that's not
[01:47:17] a main
[01:47:18] DPS although you can use Freedom SP on
[01:47:20] [ __ ] alight them I probably shouldn't
[01:47:23] have deleted that
[01:47:34] pin show B
[01:47:49] yeah
[01:47:54] Leave It All To Me as a beautiful M

[01:49:33] only sh best you haven't built her well
[01:49:35] no that's just objectively wrong I'm
[01:49:36] sorry I love you though and I love Shena
[01:49:39] though I actually have like the most
[01:49:40] insane chanha I checked earlier my
[01:49:42] Shen's [ __ ] insane cuz all my
[01:49:44] Vermillion pieces have like the most ER
[01:49:47] but uh a lot of teams need a lot of
[01:49:49] energy
[01:49:50] that would run Shena like let's say
[01:49:52] you're playing like rizzly with Shena
[01:49:53] right let's say we don't know what the
[01:49:55] [ __ ] Grizzly does right sure but let's
[01:49:56] say you're playing like rizzly Shena and
[01:49:57] then like Shang Ling right there's a
[01:49:59] good chance that the characters in your
[01:50:01] team including Shena is going to need a
[01:50:03] lot of ER so fav helps a lot with that
[01:50:06] let's say you play shho with aaka and
[01:50:08] like kazua and like kokomi and you want
[01:50:11] to have your bursts there's a good
[01:50:12] chance fa helps way more than like an
[01:50:15] attack weapon would settle down but it
[01:50:18] depends on your subs so you know that's
[01:50:21] not true for
[01:50:22] everyone the ti
[01:50:29] be bow your head how's it better I don't
[01:50:31] use f get my burst all the time okay but
[01:50:33] picture this right let's say without fav
[01:50:36] all of your characters need a little bit
[01:50:38] more ER and maybe you have that
[01:50:40] naturally on your pieces and that's cool
[01:50:42] but fav Lance allows not only will save
[01:50:45] you a bunch of ER on your Shena it'll
[01:50:47] also give energy to all of your
[01:50:48] teammates which means it'll solve any
[01:50:50] inconsistencies of getting your burst or
[01:50:52] even if you're like super optimal you
[01:50:54] have exactly enough ER on everyone now
[01:50:56] you can be super optimal by giving the
[01:50:58] characters less ER and more crit and
[01:51:01] guess what more crit on your characters
[01:51:03] is usually better than a bit more attack
[01:51:04] on your shha
[01:51:12] true oh oh my God wait double low
[01:51:16] roll it's fine it's going be good we'll
[01:51:20] level
[01:51:22] it sorry could be good could be good I
[01:51:26] can't complain about double
[01:51:29] crit dude oh speak star I rolled a star
[01:51:33] [ __ ] uh uh headpiece for my jingu it
[01:51:36] literally four sub stats crit crit
[01:51:38] attack another stat it only rolled crit
[01:51:40] and one attack roll it's [ __ ] insane
[01:51:42] you guys have to see it I'm literally
[01:51:43] going to launch St just to flex one sec
[01:51:45] let me launch

[01:52:45] can youjust your mic is like a
[01:52:46] centimeter too high what does that mean

[01:53:11] bad this is like insane actually our
[01:53:14] best piece and it's Quantum which means
[01:53:16] it's a very flexible set not I said
[01:53:19] doesn't count Quant better keep coping
[01:53:21] rip
[01:53:33] Bozo Rudin Arena mod check why don't you
[01:53:37] mod check some [ __ ] sorry that was
[01:53:40] toxic I'm sorry I more of a generalist
[01:53:43] set no maybe for Jing Leu but Quantum is
[01:53:45] more of a general set cuz Quantum
[01:53:46] characters can use it some non and some
[01:53:49] nonant characters can use it which is a
[01:53:51] lot broader than two ice characters
[01:54:00] true bow your gr grow make yourselves at
[01:54:05] home make yourselves a
[01:54:11] home let the mighty be
[01:54:17] humbled my dad is asking why a cricket

[01:56:08] make videos so I'm an adult video maker
[01:56:11] it's true I'm an adult Entertainer cuz I

[01:57:18] sorry
[01:57:21] your followers are children man [ __ ]
[01:57:23] them kids that's why I try to this is
[01:57:25] why I try to like I try to I try to like
[01:57:28] I try to like make sure I don't like how
[01:57:31] do I say this I try to make sure how do
[01:57:33] okay how do I say this I try to I try to
[01:57:35] okay I try to like C cater is cater the
[01:57:38] word I try
[01:57:39] to what's the
[01:57:42] word I try to make it okay I try to
[01:57:46] slander characters from now and then so
[01:57:48] that the like literal 12-year-olds that
[01:57:50] are like oh my God my favorite character
[01:57:53] is being slandered like don't watch me
[01:57:55] and then everyone else can enjoy the
[01:57:56] stream so it's like I try to like make
[01:57:58] it to where my community is cool so I
[01:57:59] try to like this is why this is the only
[01:58:01] reason I'm afraid of like posting on Tik
[01:58:03] Tok which I think I should cuz I make
[01:58:04] sure it's anyways and Allan needs like I
[01:58:06] don't want my editor needs more work I
[01:58:08] don't want him to go like to starve so
[01:58:11] like but listen cuz I don't want to
[01:58:13] listen I'm not listen I'm not like
[01:58:17] excessively vulgar okay I'm a little B
[01:58:20] but like I'm still family friendly no
[01:58:22] I'm not but listen I'm just saying I I
[01:58:25] can't have it to where I don't want to
[01:58:27] be afraid to call a bad character bad or
[01:58:29] to joke about a
[01:58:31] character cuz I'm also a guide maker so
[01:58:34] like if a character sucks I have to say
[01:58:35] the character sucks or else what is my
[01:58:40] credibility if de came out I was like
[01:58:42] man she's
[01:58:47] broken oh where
[01:58:53] Slanders on a good thing all characters
[01:58:55] have their prosen cons yeah that's true
[01:58:56] except shiao he has no cons dude two
[01:59:00] people at the [ __ ] convention I was
[01:59:01] at literally were like oh man I used to
[01:59:04] M Shia and now he sucks or oh he got
[01:59:06] power dude where does this narrative
[01:59:08] come from he literally didn't he's
[01:59:11] literally if anything he got better with
[01:59:14] farzon and even without her he was
[01:59:18] fine look look the current Abyss is bad
[01:59:20] for him I admit it high anemo res
[01:59:23] enemies or a single boss I get it but in
[01:59:25] most content most abysses there's a lot
[01:59:27] of enemies you have a hyrid carry
[01:59:29] there's Faron there's Bennett he's just
[01:59:32] cracked and he got better not just cuz
[01:59:34] of farzon but also uh because of new
[01:59:36] weapons team synergies and especially
[01:59:39] especially not and new accessible
[01:59:40] artifact sets veril strong box m in the
[01:59:44] domain and especially something that
[01:59:46] people Overlook is now there's a ton of
[01:59:48] meta teams that that don't need Bennett
[01:59:50] there's dentro teams hyper Bloom quickin
[01:59:52] [ __ ] bricken what that don't need
[01:59:55] Bennett and probably with Fontan a bunch
[01:59:58] of HP Skilling characters that don't
[01:59:59] need Bennett like nlet which means Shia
[02:00:01] you needing Bennett in my opinion is no
[02:00:03] longer a big downside he doesn't need
[02:00:05] Bennett but if you play him without
[02:00:06] Bennett you're kind of griefing as Z
[02:00:08] Jeff was like dude I was playing sha he
[02:00:10] felt bad I'm like wait why he's like
[02:00:11] someone in my chat made me play a full
[02:00:13] Animo team in this abyss and I looked at
[02:00:14] his stream he was playing Shia farzon
[02:00:16] Jean Kaza what the [ __ ] are those random
[02:00:19] ass characters doing in your team okay
[02:00:21] if Shia can H if you have benett
[02:00:24] available play him with Shia
[02:00:26] anyways I
[02:00:28] digress
[02:00:31] down be
[02:00:40] Sanctified bow your
[02:00:42] head gancha is great listen here bucko
[02:00:46] listen here pal ganow cool Faron sha
[02:00:50] cool Kaza sha cool but if you're playing
[02:00:53] all four together what the like what are
[02:00:55] you what are you do what are you
[02:01:06] swirling you can also argue Kaza is
[02:01:08] great because C6 farzon Buffs your Kaza
[02:01:11] a lot you can go crit kazwa and Shia and
[02:01:12] that's unironically good team but you
[02:01:14] want Ben as the last law not Jean
[02:01:17] there cuz get it anemo res decrease and
[02:01:20] all that but like there's no way it
[02:01:23] represents more team damage than no
[02:01:25] bless plus Bennett alt there's like
[02:01:28] actually no
[02:01:32] way the Temple of
[02:01:35] wisdom sh
[02:01:41] sorry I mean you could also do Gan and
[02:01:43] Bennett you can do uh Sunfire especially
[02:01:45] if you have genan cons like I'm not
[02:01:47] saying she's bad I'm just saying like
[02:01:49] often times there's very rarely a case
[02:01:52] like unless your other team is like
[02:01:53] Shang Ling or needs Bennett you almost
[02:01:55] always play Bennett with
[02:01:58] Shia bow your
[02:02:01] head in my opin in my like wide Chia
[02:02:04] experience and I've always said Shia's
[02:02:05] not dependent on Bennett cuz I don't
[02:02:06] think he is but every time I play Shia
[02:02:08] without Bennett he just feels like
[02:02:11] worse but who knows o defense
[02:02:17] wow you just acted like y man why I mean
[02:02:19] you can also play okay so Bennett what's
[02:02:22] nice about Yia is you can use Bennett
[02:02:24] but you can also use
[02:02:25] Yen and like they can be better or worse
[02:02:28] than one another depending on like
[02:02:29] constellations and
[02:02:35] stuff it to memory Shar in my knowledge
[02:02:38] our bond is let the mighty be
[02:02:43] humble months in the insane asylum
[02:02:45] youing blank sett down Candace as well
[02:02:49] wait is that actually yoia Tech I'm not
[02:02:51] that deep in the yoia mains lore is that
[02:02:53] a real thing or are you
[02:03:00] trolling
[02:03:03] silence
[02:03:04] no C6 well yeah C6 she has more like
[02:03:09] Hydro there's like an additional wave
[02:03:10] thing I remember looking into it for
[02:03:12] nuu but I don't know if it's a thing for
[02:03:17] Yia
[02:03:22] 15K hyper Bloom I we
[02:03:25] can't wait my cooki is actually fine
[02:03:42] though the Temple of
[02:03:45] wisdom your the Temple of wisdom
[02:03:49] the time
[02:03:51] is yeah wait we're doing way more than
[02:03:53] 50k on
[02:03:55] uh like see 34k hyper Bloom there so
[02:03:58] that might have been a Nita
[02:04:01] Bloom
[02:04:11] sorry j question would y be good for
[02:04:14] reove normal attacks okay we're going to
[02:04:16] have to wait and see how rizzly works
[02:04:17] okay obviously we can't fully talk about
[02:04:19] everything yet but because oh my God
[02:04:22] it's going to be good but because of
[02:04:23] what we know with like the weapon and
[02:04:24] stuff we can assume he normal attacks
[02:04:25] right if that's true yunen will be
[02:04:27] viable but it's still yunen so like
[02:04:29] she's rarely going to be like the best
[02:04:30] option it's kind of like yunen with Ayo
[02:04:32] is like you can but often times there's
[02:04:34] better teams that proc reactions that
[02:04:36] aren't Gio does that make sense but
[02:04:38] we'll have to
[02:04:47] see
[02:04:52] are you saying that Geo sucks yes but
[02:04:53] when we get the Geo region it'll get
[02:05:03] better yeah I'm going to take my horse
[02:05:06] to the Old Town
[02:05:08] Road
[02:05:10] sorry don't install my Opera girl I dude
[02:05:13] I I like her design a lot I think she's
[02:05:15] cool and like you can like I there's a
[02:05:18] lot ofam or you can use her I'm just
[02:05:19] saying a lot of times there's a better
[02:05:21] Elemental option except with like Yia
[02:05:22] and a few yeah I mean mostly just
[02:05:28] Yia it's like you can technically use
[02:05:30] her with Scara like you
[02:05:32] can but it's like well I'd ra often
[02:05:35] times I'd rather have some reaction or
[02:05:37] like I'd swirl some [ __ ] or i' do like
[02:05:39] farz on with like whatever Elemental
[02:05:47] supports
[02:05:56] d
[02:06:00] s why am I still Abyss
[02:06:12] eight are we still achievement farming
[02:06:15] yes yes we are yes sir should I level
[02:06:17] the artifacts after this
[02:06:31] yeah Yen also needs stupid amounts of ER
[02:06:33] but you can
[02:06:34] like yeah I know you
[02:06:37] do
[02:06:39] your to memory sharing my
[02:06:46] knowledge be sanctified
[02:06:57] silence see at least at least with yunen
[02:07:00] most of her ER problems come when you're
[02:07:02] a solo Geo right with with farzon even
[02:07:05] if you're a [ __ ] triple anemo team
[02:07:07] you're still you're still [ __ ]
[02:07:08] huffing and puffing that
[02:07:11] copium you need [ __ ] you need a whole
[02:07:14] ass roster to
[02:07:17] supporter
[02:07:35] de with me wait chat what if we make the
[02:07:37] most energy hungry team what if we do
[02:07:40] okay hear me out wander right let's say
[02:07:42] a team that synergize with wander let's
[02:07:43] say you do
[02:07:44] wander with c0o fars on you
[02:07:49] and Shang
[02:07:51] Ling
[02:07:54] memory let the mighty be humble or like
[02:07:56] yolan but you're not you're like on Aqua
[02:07:58] simulakra
[02:08:03] B bet is a good one
[02:08:06] too that would be a crack
[02:08:17] team
[02:08:20] you would actually I'm not even kidding
[02:08:22] you'd probably go Fab Scara just onfield
[02:08:25] fab Scara thanks to the no El bit at the
[02:08:28] start of the stream it made my
[02:08:30] weak I appreciate it son $5 like so Noel
[02:08:36] bit wait we're literally what do you
[02:08:37] mean bit we're still using
[02:08:39] her you want to see her build let's look
[02:08:41] at her build okay 100 em not bad good
[02:08:44] for crystallize goblet okay good crit
[02:08:48] value

[02:08:51] Noel uh 107 em again good for
[02:08:54] crystallize and then 63 em and a bunch
[02:08:56] of er pretty
[02:08:59] good settle down I must leave
[02:09:13] Dis Let's the Temple of wisdom imagine
[02:09:17] if get had no Fab
[02:09:19] the world would be better actually no it
[02:09:20] wouldn't cuz it's a
[02:09:22] fourstar I like I hate fa but it also
[02:09:25] makes people's lives easier so I love fa
[02:09:27] but I also hate it I don't know it's a
[02:09:28] love hate
[02:09:43] relationship why do you hate it cuz it's
[02:09:45] always the
[02:09:46] answer it's always the answer answer oh
[02:09:49] a new support character is coming out oh
[02:09:51] wonder what [ __ ] fa weapon they're
[02:09:53] going to
[02:09:59] use okay you know [ __ ] Siege windy or
[02:10:02] whatever the [ __ ] little girl in the
[02:10:04] rizzly trailer I don't know what she
[02:10:06] does what element she is or what weapon

[02:55:50] but it's also an it's kind of a no one I
[02:55:53] guess it's a showcase free this moment
[02:55:56] will be
[02:56:02] frozen Come a Little Closer you've been
[02:56:05] a naughty
[02:56:07] boy
[02:56:13] flush
[02:56:15] well well well if it isn't my favorite
[02:56:17] French adjacent internet micro celebrity
[02:56:20] don't ever call me French adjacent again
[02:56:22] how is he not

[02:56:30] [ __ ] 10
[02:56:36] minutes what the [ __ ] is
[02:56:39] it okay now it's
[02:56:41] here
[02:56:43] okay
[02:56:50] wait dude event counts though you can
[02:56:51] usually just event to reset it but I
[02:56:53] guess it wasn't or not event uh
[02:56:57] trial I guess it hasn't hadn't
[02:57:04] spawned okay I'm going to break
[02:57:06] something we're going to we're going to
[02:57:08] go for artifacts whoa artifacts I love
[02:57:11] artifacts woo I
[02:57:17] [Music]
[02:57:25] maybe cave deleted
[02:57:38] it is electr traveler good with nevi um
[02:57:45] gr gr gr my
[02:57:48] um so devet doesn't really need much
[02:57:54] energy like his best the only time he
[02:57:57] actually needs energy is with the battle
[02:57:58] pass weapon cuz his freeo playay weapons
[02:58:00] at a signature give him a [ __ ]
[02:58:02] ton and then electr traveler doesn't
[02:58:04] really do much
[02:58:05] else like I guess Electro traveler can
[02:58:08] hyper Bloom but like yeah no yeah dendr
[02:58:12] MC is better if anything
[02:58:28] is never that good with BR yeah so
[02:58:30] obviously he doesn't scale on attack so
[02:58:32] like any attack Buffs are are wasted but
[02:58:34] bronia gives you damage percent and crit
[02:58:36] damage so it's actually pretty good and
[02:58:37] you get an extra turn
[02:58:41] so it's over

[03:04:36] arlino the wander treatment I want her
[03:04:38] to still be evil listen I don't know if
[03:04:41] the this is the biggest wander s in Chad
[03:04:43] but wander is not a good guy look I get
[03:04:46] it he got [ __ ] over he just needed a
[03:04:48] hug it's not his fault what he's still
[03:04:50] he's still murder listen he's still evil
[03:04:53] let the mighty be humble like he's
[03:04:56] having like a Redemption Arc or whatever
[03:04:57] sure but he's still evil he's not like
[03:05:00] he's not a [ __ ]
[03:05:07] hero I think okay I think AR so
[03:05:12] okay he's not redeemed he's not redeemed
[03:05:15] but like he has like a I don't know he
[03:05:18] did that whole thing with the and he
[03:05:19] like became like a kind of a different
[03:05:22] character doesn't make him nice but like
[03:05:25] yeah I got [ __ ] gold uh double crit
[03:05:28] low rolls but be good too tired to be
[03:05:35] excited like okay arino I could

[03:05:46] is like literally
[03:05:47] [ __ ] yeah Dori cannot be redeemed no
[03:05:50] matter what but like unless he like
[03:05:52] clone kills him but that would be cringe
[03:05:54] and bad writing but arino I feel like
[03:05:56] they kind of introduced her as like I
[03:05:59] don't know I feel like they might be
[03:06:01] plotting something to make her playable
[03:06:04] which I'm afraid
[03:06:06] of like I want her to be playable but I
[03:06:08] don't want her to be like just nice but
[03:06:11] the thing is child is literally like a a
[03:06:15] [ __ ] war
[03:06:17] criminal and he's playable so it's
[03:06:20] fine she never did anything bad true
[03:06:23] you're right no you're right I'm sure
[03:06:26] she just I'm sure she
[03:06:29] just
[03:06:36] true she's just

[03:06:54] goofy bond is
[03:06:57] strong let the mighty be
[03:07:05] humble out of my
[03:07:07] way
[03:07:11] silence gr GR my
[03:07:23] knowledge I mean I don't know I would
[03:07:24] rather I don't care anything for to be
[03:07:26] playable I don't give a [ __ ] I don't
[03:07:28] give a [ __ ] whatever solution they have
[03:07:29] to
[03:07:30] do however I assume we don't know enough
[03:07:34] about her yet I assume she's just
[03:07:35] raising an army of [ __ ] children that
[03:07:37] she's manipulating into becoming fuis
[03:07:40] but I could be wrong maybe maybe she's
[03:07:42] just like I'm saving children cuz she
[03:07:43] like lowy I know she helped helped
[03:07:45] [ __ ] like Lynette and stuff but like
[03:07:48] I don't know we don't know enough about
[03:07:51] it maybe she's just a good
[03:07:54] person
[03:08:04] cop the ti is

[03:11:17] character is
[03:11:22] cooler that is Shonen I guess maybe it's
[03:11:24] just
[03:11:25] Shonen I don't know I've seen TV shows
[03:11:27] like that too
[03:11:36] though says the MAA cosplayer I am not a

[03:12:55] compliment is not strong you said isn't
[03:12:57] that what he said you're bored of okay
[03:12:58] here's the thing with gone first of all
[03:13:00] the more episodes you have the more you
[03:13:02] can actually like see if a character is
[03:13:04] good or not second of all I think he was
[03:13:06] a dumb stupid loser fighting with a
[03:13:08] fishing rod for like 20 episodes and
[03:13:10] that was cringe however eventually no
[03:13:12] spoilers he turned into a [ __ ] badass
[03:13:14] and there was one episode where I was
[03:13:15] like holy [ __ ] this character is kind of
[03:13:16] cool and those who watched it know what
[03:13:18] I'm talking
[03:13:19] about but also at the start he was like
[03:13:22] like [ __ ] 10 so it's like I get him
[03:13:23] being just a [ __ ] kid but like I
[03:13:26] don't
[03:13:30] know he got cool

[03:14:18] dude we've spent so much resin and I
[03:14:20] can't even think of an artifact we have
[03:14:22] to show for it we got like a slightly
[03:14:24] better
[03:14:32] feather Justice is
[03:14:36] blindsided settle down commit it to
[03:14:39] memory I commit it to memory
[03:14:56] ooh ooh o maybe I mean his HP
[03:15:04] so are you mocking Nikita what do you
[03:15:06] mean I like
[03:15:11] Nita
[03:15:31] is finina good with Jing theu yeah you
[03:15:33] can play a Farina jinglu freeze team
[03:15:35] probably
[03:15:37] true let's go do the boss
[03:15:40] again imagine I still hasn't respawned
[03:15:43] wait one
[03:15:49] sec all
[03:16:06] right the Temple of
[03:16:10] wion b b bow sorry
[03:16:19] Chad who's more broken Bennett or
[03:16:32] BR you guys are
[03:16:34] split ooh wait we haven't gotten a a
[03:16:36] [ __ ] Golden One Forever
[03:16:40] D Ben is accessible for
[03:16:43] everyone yeah but I mean I guess he's
[03:16:46] yeah he is a four star which changes
[03:16:48] something but br's I don't know BR is
[03:16:50] kind of [ __ ] cracked cuz some
[03:16:52] characters some characters can just use
[03:16:54] tting Yun and then you're chilling cuz
[03:16:55] BR yeah she spam skill points but other
[03:16:58] characters like the characters that can
[03:17:01] use tun well usually can also use BR and
[03:17:03] some characters can only use braia or
[03:17:05] you have like nothing like you have like
[03:17:07] ASA which is fine
[03:17:11] but
[03:17:19] ill can yes inor Lun can use BR you just
[03:17:22] you basic attack on BR and then you uh
[03:17:24] uh uh no sorry you basic attack on inor
[03:17:26] then you skill on BR and you have
[03:17:28] another turn on in where you do your N3
[03:17:30] and it's fully buffed and her Buffs are
[03:17:32] so good that it makes it worth is it
[03:17:33] better than Ting you there usually not
[03:17:35] but it still
[03:17:36] works it just has less value in that
[03:17:38] team like bronia has less value in that
[03:17:40] team than with your other team probably
[03:17:41] so usually I recommend using her in like
[03:17:43] your blade or whatever else team but if
[03:17:46] you have her available you can still use
[03:17:47] her with a character that you're not
[03:17:48] supposed to use her with where the [ __ ]

[03:25:43] 7,000 resin on on net video that I

[03:25:48] except like the last part so this a good
[03:25:49] segue oh [ __ ] let's take a look at what
[03:25:52] our nevet has so so if we look at all
[03:25:54] the Marie chose pieces we
[03:25:57] got we have uh you know this one has
[03:26:00] nice crit damage em HP uh we have this
[03:26:03] uh flower really good crit value as well
[03:26:04] I don't know why this one's not equipped
[03:26:06] uh we have a few others this one's good
[03:26:08] this one also has really good crit value
[03:26:09] a lot of good flowers uh genuinely
[03:26:12] uh uh uh and then feather this one's
[03:26:13] just unbeatable this one's just this is
[03:26:16] so scrumptuous if I close my eyes and
[03:26:18] dream I see this piece am I I'm not
[03:26:20] dreaming why did I hit myself I could
[03:26:22] have just
[03:26:23] pinched look at this look at this we
[03:26:25] have uh our Sands kind of suck except
[03:26:26] our hp1 it's decent like it's not good
[03:26:29] it's it's not great but it's okay it's
[03:26:31] our worst never that piece but it's fine
[03:26:34] um wait we also got a goblet recently so
[03:26:38] why am
[03:26:38] I I'll change my artifacts around but we
[03:26:41] also got a Hydro goet recently it's not
[03:26:42] the best it's okay uh it's not supposed
[03:26:44] to be on him right now but
[03:26:48] whatever and then we also got a decent
[03:26:50] circus look at this okay this one kind
[03:26:51] of sucks this one's not bad though 10
[03:26:53] crit rate not bad what about this one
[03:26:56] all attack not for never that though but
[03:26:58] this one's really good wait let me gear
[03:26:59] him what am I on wait no no we're on the
[03:27:01] wrong build we're actually on the wrong
[03:27:02] build we're actually on the wrong build
[03:27:04] W we're on the wrong build what am I
[03:27:06] normally on why is someone laughing at
[03:27:08] my defense oh cuz I give this to Ayo
[03:27:10] wait wait wait that's why I give IO my
[03:27:12] good goblet but normally it's like wait
[03:27:14] what I want a
[03:27:22] two-piece wait we have 320 crit damage
[03:27:25] but this is not enough crit rate uh we
[03:27:28] could use a bit more ER though I mean
[03:27:31] not er sorry we could use a bit more HP
[03:27:33] do I have HP perc Subs on something this
[03:27:35] has attack set I kind want to use it on
[03:27:36] like Shia I'm not going to
[03:27:40] lie that's probably the most we can get
[03:27:42] HP ciret I don't want to I don't have a
[03:27:44] good one HP circet is only better if
[03:27:46] your sub stats are like really
[03:27:48] good like if I had an HP CLE with no
[03:27:51] subs it wouldn't be better you need sub
[03:27:53] stats I mean I guess these Subs kind of
[03:27:55] suck balls so it wouldn't even be hard
[03:27:56] for us to get a better HP circlet but I
[03:27:59] don't think we have one do
[03:28:02] I maybe this R crit damage we could try
[03:28:05] it that's kind of dog
[03:28:07] [ __ ] that one also could R crit damage
[03:28:10] ah [ __ ] it I guess
[03:28:13] I lock
[03:28:16] it this will also be yeah this will also
[03:28:18] be great on rizzly this will also be
[03:28:20] amazing on RZ actually cuz you oh my God
[03:28:22] yeah we're going to give this to rizy
[03:28:23] but uh we could give our nevet like
[03:28:26] literally dude we have so many good ones
[03:28:27] like let's say we give him this one okay
[03:28:30] the only thing our levet needs this has
[03:28:31] a lot of HP the only thing our levet
[03:28:32] needs is more HP but 33k for now 50
[03:28:35] basically 300 crit damage or if we go
[03:28:38] the other feather like this one then
[03:28:39] we'll have over 300 crit damage
[03:28:41] boom but obviously we want a bit more HP
[03:28:43] but this crit rate is good because you
[03:28:45] gain uh uh why can't I M sorry 36% crit
[03:28:48] rate on the
[03:28:50] mar should we wait to see his stats no
[03:28:53] rizzly we saw his weapon today and his
[03:28:54] weapon gives him attack percent and uh
[03:28:57] normal and Char attack damage which
[03:28:58] means he's going to use attack percent
[03:29:05] true but we'll leave him on this for now
[03:29:07] but this is my aatos goblet I don't
[03:29:09] really want to take it from him
[03:29:14] um is that why I was using a offset
[03:29:17] circlet that gave me HP
[03:29:24] maybe okay I have 34 crit rate
[03:29:28] sorry okay that's kind of scuffed
[03:29:30] actually I don't know we'll figure it
[03:29:34] out that's why I was using this right
[03:29:37] but this still isn't enough
[03:29:39] yeah yeah yeah okay our other build's
[03:29:45] better wait what's our Kay on
[03:30:07] balls Hydro damage crit rate yeah our
[03:30:11] best one's on iO right
[03:30:25] now some has an HP perent roll
[03:30:28] though whatever we use this for
[03:30:31] now
[03:30:34] anyways check
[03:30:39] flower oh yeah our flower could be
[03:30:40] better
[03:30:42] too wait why do we have this hard
[03:30:44] equipped I guess the
[03:30:47] hp% do I have another one wait this one
[03:30:49] also has HP what the [ __ ] wait we just
[03:30:50] do
[03:30:52] that yeah we just do this lower now we
[03:30:55] get more HP wait this is a lot better
[03:30:57] obviously we could still use more HP but
[03:30:58] 57 through four it's a lot better okay
[03:31:00] there you go nice okay yeah actually
[03:31:02] actually a good hole actually good hole
[03:31:04] I'm happy are guilded dreams could be
[03:31:05] better we spent more resin since last
[03:31:06] time we talked but our guilded dreams
[03:31:08] like there's some pieces like this G
[03:31:09] could be good on official but it could
[03:31:11] definitely be better we just got a new
[03:31:12] flower I think yeah our flower is good
[03:31:14] we still don't have a single Sands
[03:31:15] though um and our ciret is just em but
[03:31:18] our guilded uh dreams is or M show is
[03:31:21] kind of insane did I call it guilded
[03:31:24] dreams whatever golden troop freak you

[03:34:04] incident gr Shar my
[03:34:08] knowledge I don't know if it's lock or
[03:34:10] it's just the sheer volume of uh
[03:34:12] artifacts we've
[03:34:14] done but I'm glad that now we're at a
[03:34:17] point where maybe we redeem
[03:34:21] ourselves what are you going to do
[03:34:23] strong box either emblem or Vermilion I
[03:34:25] really should do emblem but I don't know
[03:34:27] if I'm responsible enough to do
[03:34:30] emblem
[03:34:34] silence I asked slice if he wanted to do
[03:34:37] a a strong Box challenge where we both
[03:34:39] strong box like 500 pieces and then
[03:34:41] whoever gets the best build wins and the
[03:34:43] loser has to do

[03:45:09] differ between our knowledge as soon as
[03:45:11] the banner drops and our knowledge the
[03:45:12] day after is pretty big because a lot of
[03:45:15] new things get discovered which is why I
[03:45:16] try to wait a little bit so we're going
[03:45:17] to wait a little bit at least till the
[03:45:18] end of the day and then I'll upload it
[03:45:21] um because there's a lot of things I
[03:45:22] still want to test or want to make sure
[03:45:25] that what I tested is accurate so stay
