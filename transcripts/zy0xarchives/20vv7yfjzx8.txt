[00:22:24] Clueless Okay
[00:22:27] okay hi Z
[00:22:29] YX are you going to stop pretending like
[00:22:32] you are not Wanderer in real
[00:22:35] life
[00:22:43] okay what the [ __ ] is
[00:22:46] oh check the trending tab I think I
[00:22:49] already
[00:22:55] did yeah that's how I added Yin
[00:23:17] oh Turtle
[00:23:24] jamming okay anyways um
[00:23:29] we have stuff to do stuff to okay okay I
[00:23:32] kind of gave you guys half my thoughts
[00:23:35] for the rest of the thoughts on this
[00:23:36] since we're finally streaming genin
[00:23:40] uh the custom Loadout thing it's not
[00:23:42] custom it's not loadouts which again I'm
[00:23:45] always going to be mad about until we
[00:23:46] actually get load outs however uh
[00:23:49] apparently it's fast equipped based on
[00:23:52] popular stats which means that for some
[00:23:54] characters I can just Auto equip uh uh
[00:23:57] if I need to gear the for the abyss so
[00:23:59] at least it's going to save a bit of
[00:24:00] time but for the most part it's kind of
[00:24:01] whatever uh friendless cap increase is
[00:24:04] good increase resin cap is either good
[00:24:07] or useless depending on how often you
[00:24:09] play for the most part it's just
[00:24:10] convenient but it's not
[00:24:13] like just I mean it's fine
[00:24:33] yeah is there anything else I'm trying
[00:24:35] to see if I forgeting something friend
[00:24:37] list I think that's
[00:24:41] it
[00:24:48] w doesn't do anything for hardcore
[00:24:50] players I mean I'm going to be honest
[00:24:52] I'm one of the sweatiest players you can
[00:24:54] be like genuinely in like every game
[00:24:56] I've played ever and like just being
[00:24:59] being able to log in less often when
[00:25:01] you're busy or doing other [ __ ] in my
[00:25:03] opinion is good even if it's not like it
[00:25:06] doesn't ma like matter in terms of like
[00:25:08] how many artifacts you can get per day
[00:25:10] cuz it's the same [ __ ]
[00:25:12] resin but I don't
[00:25:16] know it's not amazing like I'm not I'm
[00:25:18] not here to glaze it but it's I I I
[00:25:20] don't think it's like
[00:25:23] irrelevant
[00:25:27] anyways like look I love star rail I'm
[00:25:30] 240 out of 240 right now caught I I know
[00:25:33] look I know I know I know I am I
[00:25:38] know eight months of life wasted on you
[00:25:41] ever like did some I'm like so capped
[00:25:43] that I don't even want to launch the
[00:25:45] game cuz then I have to deal with the
[00:25:46] fact that I've been capped for so
[00:25:52] long I just okay anyways
[00:26:04] Starfire freak you Starfire first
[00:26:07] message to S that's respectable
[00:26:15] honestly dude I just used my Shia e
[00:26:17] after using GN for like two days
[00:26:20] straight and it actually killed an enemy
[00:26:21] and it gave me like Whiplash like I I
[00:26:24] forgot my e could kill
[00:26:26] things cuz my ch's like level like 40
[00:26:32] 50 all right
[00:26:38] anyways all right ready chat it's time
[00:26:40] to it's time to start stalling we'll
[00:26:43] talk about what my predictions
[00:26:45] expectations and hopes are for genin
[00:26:47] impacts 4.7 stream but first we have a
[00:26:49] bit of stalling to do cuz it's in like

[00:27:17] account has been in the chasm more than
[00:27:19] anyone here anyone probably like anyone

[01:06:15] that every Fontan suffers from but they
[01:06:19] don't trust me at all do you really
[01:06:21] think it matters whether I'm meloine or
[01:06:23] a human I don't believe Master would
[01:06:26] suddenly disappear for no reason there
[01:06:28] must have been something she just had to
[01:06:30] do in the new world they B farewell to
[01:06:33] the shrouded Sun at last they no longer
[01:06:37] needed to dwell on their suffering or
[01:06:39] try to differentiate between various
[01:06:41] thoughts of what the [ __ ] is this such
[01:06:43] was the price they paid and thus their
[01:06:45] souls became cleansed and pure wait

[01:07:08] trap one day what is that sword I shall
[01:07:11] have my
[01:07:13] Vengeance that

[01:09:50] this is getting exciting there it is all
[01:09:52] right then well how about we start off
[01:09:54] by introducing fon 's strongest Champion
[01:09:56] duelist choren clent my
[01:09:59] goat it's true please be good please be
[01:10:01] good please be good please be good
[01:10:02] Champion duelist my do not matter for
[01:10:06] when I draw my blade I am but an
[01:10:09] instrument of fontaine's
[01:10:11] law instrument of fontaine's law
[01:10:16] okay okay
[01:10:22] ready that is long range which which is
[01:10:25] cool she just dashed through him
[01:10:27] shooting him with a gun shoot on sight
[01:10:31] what the [ __ ] was
[01:10:34] that those animations did you see that
[01:10:37] timate that was like [ __ ] Electro
[01:10:39] kaching I'm sorry that was really
[01:10:41] interesting she inherited it from the
[01:10:43] marose hunters ooh the hunters from the
[01:10:47] artifact set mhm the marose hunters were
[01:10:50] an organization that defeated monsters
[01:10:52] and upheld Justice from the Shadows okay
[01:10:55] I think the group's name has also been
[01:10:57] mentioned in some of fontaine's
[01:10:58] historical records exactly it's also an
[01:11:00] artifact Jose Hunters have a long
[01:11:02] history to modern day fontans they're
[01:11:04] nothing more than an old Legend from
[01:11:06] novels and plays but for claran the
[01:11:08] marose hunter Legacy is really real yeah
[01:11:12] want to learn more about the marose
[01:11:13] hunters then be sure to check out Clan's
[01:11:15] story quest in the new version I want to
[01:11:18] learn more about the maros hunters oh I
[01:11:20] can tell you more 15% normal Char damage
[01:11:22] on the twopiece grand is categorized as
[01:11:24] an electro sword user
[01:11:25] but she actually a sword and AO to ATT
[01:11:29] her enemies during combat now hermal
[01:11:31] attack deals phal damage by performing
[01:11:33] up to five consecutive strikes during
[01:11:36] her charged attack cland uses her pisto
[01:11:38] to Target en shape in front of
[01:11:41] her also has developed a special ritual
[01:11:44] over the years she always polishes her
[01:11:46] weapon before each duel that is so
[01:11:49] dignified of her I know right and kind
[01:11:51] of adorable even the champion dualist of
[01:11:53] Fontaine has a cute side huh
[01:11:55] a Sarah is starting to sound just like
[01:11:58] seen what though it's probably a
[01:12:01] meaningful ritual for claran right
[01:12:03] that's exactly right it's a habit that
[01:12:05] helps claran focus on the opponent in
[01:12:06] front of her in fact Clan's Elemental
[01:12:09] skill Hunter's vigil is an ability that
[01:12:11] demonstrates how potent she can be when
[01:12:13] she's focused check this out during
[01:12:16] combat unleashing claran will cause her
[01:12:19] to that was kind of smooth that was kind
[01:12:20] of smooth during this St claran can
[01:12:22] unleash honest to God I haven't seen her
[01:12:24] skill before I'm not I'm not I Haven
[01:12:26] seened into hunt pisto attacks and her
[01:12:29] Elemental skill will be converted into a
[01:12:31] lunging attack impale the night I also
[01:12:34] saw an electro particle so she's
[01:12:36] objectively better than does the skill
[01:12:38] have any additional effects oh good
[01:12:40] perception on those eyes those Swift
[01:12:43] attacks increase Clan's Bond of life and
[01:12:46] her luning attack impale the night will
[01:12:48] clear the bond of life wait so she
[01:12:50] accumulates the bond with one hand and
[01:12:52] then clears it with the other oh hey
[01:12:54] that's a really good explanation yeah
[01:12:56] Clan's special attacks have different
[01:12:58] effects depending on the value of her
[01:12:59] bond of life so when her bond of life is
[01:13:02] like relatively low her Swift hunt
[01:13:04] pistol attacks have a piercing effect
[01:13:06] and they deal greater damage but when
[01:13:09] her bond of life is relatively High her
[01:13:11] lunging attack impale the night has a
[01:13:13] greater AOE and Deals higher damage ah
[01:13:17] gotcha I get it [ __ ] UT meant to use her
[01:13:19] pistol to accumulate and then use her
[01:13:22] sword to clear it once it reaches a
[01:13:24] certain amount that way both attacks
[01:13:26] benefit each other Bingo though you
[01:13:28] should remember the effect of one of
[01:13:29] Clan's unique talents so when she's in
[01:13:33] the night vigil State any healing other
[01:13:35] than the one provided by her lunging
[01:13:37] attack impale the night will be
[01:13:39] converted into a bond of life this
[01:13:42] unique talent allows different healing
[01:13:44] effects to alter the pacing of Clan's
[01:13:46] gameplay so Travelers can experiment
[01:13:48] with a variety of different tactical
[01:13:49] combinations that's cool also although
[01:13:52] cland is most renowned as a champion
[01:13:54] duelist she has has never forgotten her
[01:13:56] identity as a marose hunter so during
[01:13:58] her Elemental burst last lightfall
[01:14:01] claran draw Hunter Heritage to unleash
[01:14:04] an ancient skill that empowers Mortals
[01:14:06] to fight deadly monsters okay grant that
[01:14:09] I've seen that animation but it's a sick
[01:14:11] animation strike her opponents her burst
[01:14:13] deals AOE Electro damage and grants her
[01:14:15] a bond of life based on her it is a sick
[01:14:17] animation I can't lie it's [ __ ] sick
[01:14:20] but if that power is designed to fight
[01:14:22] Mo like look at that she's just like it
[01:14:25] in a regular duel good point I think
[01:14:28] Claren just has to adjust the uh amount
[01:14:30] of force that she puts behind those
[01:14:32] blows that makes sense also Claren can
[01:14:35] draw the strength of her companions
[01:14:37] after unlocking her passive Talent dark
[01:14:39] shattering flame man that sounds cool so
[01:14:43] when a nearby party member triggers an
[01:14:44] electro related reaction the electro
[01:14:47] damage dealt by her normal attack and
[01:14:49] her Elemental burst will increase based
[01:14:51] on her attack value though note there is
[01:14:54] a ceiling to the D
[01:14:55] that can gain from this effect also has
[01:14:58] another passive Talent called lawful
[01:15:01] remuneration if her bond of life is
[01:15:03] greater than or equal to a certain
[01:15:05] percentage then a change in her bond of
[01:15:07] Life value will increase her cr r the
[01:15:10] electro damage of her normal while she's
[01:15:11] in the night vigil State the percentage
[01:15:13] of healing converted into a bond of life
[01:15:15] will increase wow yeah and finally being
[01:15:18] a champion dualist gives cland a strong
[01:15:21] only skill was electro but I guess there
[01:15:22] might be an infusion I missed I wasn't F
[01:15:24] reading
[01:15:25] locations of Fontaine Regional resources
[01:15:28] on the mini map so awesome I'm sure that
[01:15:31] Travelers will be eager to use her to
[01:15:33] uncover treasure May burst infuses or
[01:15:34] something pistol counts Justice not
[01:15:37] necessarily in that order so so so so so
[01:15:40] cland is usually pretty Stern and
[01:15:42] composed as a champion oh I wonder how
[01:15:46] wines like does she have any I'm sure
[01:15:50] that she has some interest outside of
[01:15:51] work I mean she's always accepting
[01:15:53] cosmetic products from seen and making
[01:15:55] sure to return the favor cuz she's sweet
[01:15:57] a and yeah of course she does cland is
[01:16:00] an active member of the tabletop troop
[01:16:02] during her off hours
[01:16:04] so. Travelers won't just have the chance
[01:16:06] to learn more about the mar Hunters
[01:16:08] during her story Quest the raparia
[01:16:10] chapter they'll also get to join claran
[01:16:12] on a very special tabletop troop
[01:16:14] Adventure woo I love ttrpgs so much I
[01:16:19] know I'm so
[01:16:21] excited and with all of that that is all
[01:16:24] the information that I have to share
[01:16:25] about claran so next up let's introduce
[01:16:28] our adorable little seen oh yes yes okay
[01:16:31] sorry too excited hold on I look at her
[01:16:34] Demo First
[01:16:36] yes one body so you got to take care of
[01:16:39] it but it's just as important to take
[01:16:41] her color palette is
[01:16:43] cool and the pill is pretty sick hold
[01:16:47] still admittedly I think doctor Mario's
[01:16:49] cooler than
[01:16:53] Mario okay the hydro uh abys Mage feel a
[01:16:57] little
[01:16:58] [Music]
[01:17:02] prick what the [ __ ] was that was that a
[01:17:04] hard gun she was that healer unreal wow
[01:17:10] I love her pills so much bubble has ears
[01:17:13] on it I would love to ride around on a
[01:17:15] bubble like that she's with her little
[01:17:16] legs dangling in the air yeah with the
[01:17:18] bubble gun and the giant syringe God is
[01:17:21] so cute those bubbles are so big her kit
[01:17:25] looks really really fun I like the
[01:17:27] little heart met she she uses on her
[01:17:29] patients I can see why they might be
[01:17:30] nervous about getting sick for sure hey
[01:17:33] sometimes you got to take your medicine
[01:17:35] and since she's the head nurse at The
[01:17:36] Fortress of mared sewe wants everyone to
[01:17:39] stay healthy she believes that taking
[01:17:41] care of your body is the most important
[01:17:43] goal but she often encounters people who
[01:17:45] overwork themselves in the production
[01:17:47] zone so she always tries to sneak them
[01:17:49] healthy meals but she doesn't think
[01:17:51] that's a substitute for some proper rest
[01:17:54] oh take a page out of her book yeah
[01:17:55] seems like you'll need to be well fed
[01:17:57] and well rested if you want to keep up
[01:17:58] with sewe for sure she seems like such a
[01:18:01] caring and attentive person but then
[01:18:03] what's she like when she
[01:18:05] fights is a hydro bow user her normal
[01:18:08] attack unleashes up to three was that a
[01:18:10] bow what the [ __ ] she's a bow second and
[01:18:12] third attack SE takes out a pill and
[01:18:14] tosses it at her opponent saw what she
[01:18:17] she's literally telling her opponents to
[01:18:19] take their medicine look at the size of
[01:18:20] that thing she can make aimed shots
[01:18:22] using her charged attack once the shot
[01:18:24] is H and fully charged SE soul will fire
[01:18:27] slow moving ministration bubbles dealing
[01:18:30] Hydro damage to her Target surely we
[01:18:32] never that to release her Arrow oh and
[01:18:35] also seen uses a specially made bubble
[01:18:37] gun to fire a giant bolstering bubble
[01:18:40] bomb during her Elemental skill rebound
[01:18:42] hydrotherapy the projectile bounces
[01:18:45] between nearby opponents dealing Hydro
[01:18:47] damage to anyone it touches and
[01:18:49] restoring to all nearby party members
[01:18:51] except for seen herself seege will be
[01:18:54] healed a c amount of Health when the
[01:18:55] bolstering bubble bomb disappears which
[01:18:57] is based on her Max HP hping bubble bomb
[01:19:02] F please don't make me you know
[01:19:04] Travelers could have a a bubble-blowing
[01:19:06] contest with their seines would that be
[01:19:08] great you can have that exactly true I'm
[01:19:11] sure she'll be great in P your Elemental
[01:19:13] skill the larger the bubble grows
[01:19:16] projectile is released it will gradually
[01:19:18] decrease in size as it bounces around
[01:19:20] man [ __ ] you the greater the damage and
[01:19:23] healing effect a large Bubble Hits a
[01:19:25] weaker enemy they'll be trapped inside
[01:19:28] wa guys it's like she's trapping them in
[01:19:30] a cage of kindness like hyro you can
[01:19:33] tell she she cares about her bedside
[01:19:35] manner is so
[01:19:36] strong hey wait a second are those the
[01:19:39] orbs that nolet drops it looks like SE
[01:19:41] creates two Source water drop fires a
[01:19:45] bubble touches them how does that work I
[01:19:47] can't explain that as well since she has
[01:19:49] training as a nurse seuen understands
[01:19:52] how to make the most of a dire situation
[01:19:54] her Elemental skill creates Source water
[01:19:57] droplets and SE can give herself a bond
[01:19:59] of Life by absorbing them when that Bond
[01:20:01] of life is cleared sewing can regain
[01:20:04] some Elemental energy based on the value
[01:20:06] of the bond it'd be so sick if she
[01:20:08] actually healed enemies but buffed you
[01:20:10] healing can nullify her like she'll heal
[01:20:12] the enemies over time but she increases
[01:20:14] your damage so it's worth it that's
[01:20:16] right while the bond of life is
[01:20:17] hazardous to most people it can actually
[01:20:19] and if you don't do enough damage then
[01:20:21] she'll out heal your damage after she
[01:20:23] unlocks her Talent diagnosis thorough
[01:20:25] treatment siegen's healing will be
[01:20:27] increased based on the Total Bond of
[01:20:29] Life all the characters in her party oh
[01:20:32] thank they're trying to make bond of
[01:20:33] Life mine can make the bond of Life a
[01:20:35] lot less
[01:20:36] scary after using her Elemental burst
[01:20:38] and absorbing nearby Source water
[01:20:40] droplets that e looks clunky if you have
[01:20:42] to charge it like hopefully I don't have
[01:20:43] to hold it for [ __ ] two years attack
[01:20:45] deals continuous Hydro damage that's so
[01:20:48] cute even her attacks are a form of
[01:20:49] medical treatment huge syring yeah I
[01:20:52] mean hey she just wants everyone to be
[01:20:54] as healthy as possible yeah right seeg
[01:20:57] wants every patient to get a proper
[01:20:59] amount of rest after unlocking her
[01:21:01] passive Talent requires appropriate rest
[01:21:04] unleashing her Elemental skill will also
[01:21:06] trigger the semi-strict bed rest effect
[01:21:09] this effect will grant her a hydro
[01:21:10] damage bonus and several stacks of
[01:21:13] convalescent yeah the burst feels long
[01:21:16] to use element which it could still be
[01:21:18] good can consume a stack of
[01:21:20] convalescence to increase that Elemental
[01:21:22] skill with my supports I just want to
[01:21:23] press a button and get off like I don't
[01:21:25] want to stay on them not super strict
[01:21:27] cuz she couldn't be super strict just a
[01:21:29] little wow so it seems like the bond of
[01:21:31] Life mechanic is pretty integral to both
[01:21:33] is and Clan's kits mhm that sure was a
[01:21:37] lot of information though oh yeah I
[01:21:39] can't wait to see these abilities in
[01:21:40] action and travelers Benn do swap swap
[01:21:44] theyve seen here
[01:21:46] right one butt a lot of room for open
[01:21:48] experimentation yeah yeah and outside of
[01:21:51] combat Mel connected to the ocean so see
[01:21:55] always takes care of her companions
[01:21:56] during underwater exploration seege is
[01:21:59] especially helpful when her friends are
[01:22:01] endangered by of hydro is
[01:22:04] good wait this account C this account
[01:22:07] has the I didn't log in for two weeks
[01:22:09] thing whoever playing here didn't play
[01:22:12] for 2 weeks it's like welcome
[01:22:15] back I C you cool that seems like a
[01:22:18] skill that would come in handy though
[01:22:20] seege is always looking out for us
[01:22:23] thanks head nurse of course oh and I've
[01:22:27] got a quick question for you all yes
[01:22:29] have you noticed any differences between
[01:22:31] Siege and other melines ah well oh yes I
[01:22:35] have appearance and her interests
[01:22:37] definitely stand out if you ignore the
[01:22:39] tail and The Feelers on her head then
[01:22:40] she actually doesn't look that different
[01:22:41] from a human it's probably a Dev account
[01:22:43] chat I'm kidding like for the but also
[01:22:46] she's interested in Beauty and she knows
[01:22:47] a lot about skin care and she actually
[01:22:49] even contributes to the most famous
[01:22:50] beauty magazine in Fontaine did not know
[01:22:53] that oh oh oh and her medical knowledge
[01:22:55] we haven't encountered any other melozin
[01:22:57] who give medical treatment to humans and
[01:22:59] seen seems to care the most about the
[01:23:02] people of Fontaine and she's also one of
[01:23:04] the few Melo who work in the Fortress of
[01:23:06] meped right speaking to be honest I do
[01:23:10] like her design I mean I hate kids you
[01:23:11] know that but like I I like her I think
[01:23:13] she's cute whatever SE does and you're
[01:23:17] all bringing up great points don't you
[01:23:19] think that se we's differences from the
[01:23:21] other melines make her seem more unique
[01:23:23] and approachable at the same same time
[01:23:25] in the Nar e chapter Travelers will have
[01:23:27] chance to learn more about the
[01:23:29] background of this very special meloine
[01:23:31] in her personal story quest woohoo
[01:23:34] that's a cool icon some hey speaking of
[01:23:36] story quests travelers meet a mysterious
[01:23:39] youngster last version sometime during
[01:23:42] sinos story Quest cool hopefully a good
[01:23:44] forar will now have the opportunity B no
[01:23:47] we want a good forar guming was good
[01:23:49] left the desert and good so Zach why
[01:23:53] don't you introduce go oh me okay then
[01:23:57] let's take a look at Seth's demo if
[01:24:00] you're always asking why end up thinking
[01:24:02] yourself into a corner sometimes it's
[01:24:05] better to let go this guy's eyes are
[01:24:10] like give me some space it's like the
[01:24:13] meme of like guys with green eyes and
[01:24:17] brown hair and it's like you know what
[01:24:20] I'm talk about no
[01:24:22] okay is he a normal attack
[01:24:25] [Music]
[01:24:29] no okay his design is so cool he looks
[01:24:34] amazing yeah the clothes and the hair I
[01:24:36] love it right sethos didn't just get
[01:24:38] power and wisdom from his desert
[01:24:40] Heritage he's also talented in archery
[01:24:44] sethos has always loved hiking and he
[01:24:46] has a great sense of direction whether
[01:24:48] he's exploring the desert or the
[01:24:50] rainforest he knows the roads like the
[01:24:52] back of his hand and he always knows
[01:24:55] where to find the best Regional
[01:24:57] Specialties yeah you probably know where
[01:24:59] this is going but I'll say it anyway
[01:25:01] when sethos is in your team he'll reveal
[01:25:04] the location of sumeo regional
[01:25:06] Specialties on the m i mean it's a
[01:25:07] little late for suu but I mean it's
[01:25:09] still a good pass he in a remote desert
[01:25:11] for his entire life could used that two
[01:25:13] years ago or a year ago to me it seems
[01:25:15] like someone with that kind of
[01:25:16] upbringing would either be like really
[01:25:18] introverted or just super arrogant but
[01:25:20] sethos doesn't seem like that at all
[01:25:22] yeah you're absolutely right sethos is a
[01:25:24] very open-minded
[01:25:26] and as sucessor to the mysterious temp
[01:25:29] good for a forer to have it then mind I
[01:25:31] think what I than other people who live
[01:25:33] in suu's desert his responsibilities
[01:25:36] drive him to learn about other people
[01:25:38] and places he has a very open mind and
[01:25:40] he tries to be optimistic in fact his
[01:25:43] personality is a huge help in getting
[01:25:45] along with other people so wait that
[01:25:47] sounds like are you saying he's a social
[01:25:51] butterfly I guess he's a pretty busy guy
[01:25:54] and he lives a pretty varied lifestyle
[01:25:57] and he's around the same age as the
[01:25:59] general Maham matrao he occasionally
[01:26:01] visits the Academia he's always trying
[01:26:03] to make friends in suu city and he
[01:26:05] enjoys browsing Goods at the Grand
[01:26:07] Bazaar but we've already talked a lot
[01:26:09] about his
[01:26:11] Hobbies combat yes Seth's aim shot has a
[01:26:15] special variant when charged to level
[01:26:17] two he can't move when his attack is
[01:26:19] charged to its second level but it
[01:26:21] allows him to Shadow shot Pierce
[01:26:25] enem to Targets in its path that took
[01:26:27] like seconds Talent black Kit's Enigma
[01:26:31] increase the charging time by consuming
[01:26:34] Elemental energy okay he can decrease it
[01:26:35] some Elemental energy will also be
[01:26:37] consumed after releasing thank God nice
[01:26:40] o useful yeah and also I noticed his aim
[01:26:42] shots take a really long time to charge
[01:26:45] so I think means players need to store
[01:26:46] up Elemental energy
[01:26:48] toow no but you you can decrease it you
[01:26:50] can decrease it hey wait a minute I feel
[01:26:52] like this is the first genin impact
[01:26:53] character who actually consumes
[01:26:54] Elemental energy while firing aimed
[01:26:56] shots what that's cool it's like oh no
[01:26:58] that's not true reminiscence of the
[01:27:00] shimana is a fourar set that does
[01:27:02] Elemental energy it's an ancient ritual
[01:27:05] that deals damage also restores
[01:27:08] Elemental energy when a hit on an enemy
[01:27:10] triggers an overloaded electrocharged
[01:27:13] superconduct Electro swirl Quicken
[01:27:16] aggravate or hyper Bloom reaction that's
[01:27:19] a lot but Travelers also have another
[01:27:22] option for firing powerful shots by
[01:27:24] unleashing his Elemental burst sethos
[01:27:27] will perform an ancient ritual that was
[01:27:29] passed down from King des's era that's
[01:27:31] really cool that's sick but why does
[01:27:33] this skill want you to charge and his
[01:27:35] normal attacks to DUS bolts that deal
[01:27:38] increased damage based on his Elemental
[01:27:40] that's really cool shots I think that
[01:27:42] animation is really
[01:27:44] sicking imagine he's better than I
[01:27:47] didn't say that okay also it seems like
[01:27:49] the records of King desit have a lot of
[01:27:51] powerful abilities so two play Styles oh
[01:27:53] God do that mean seos has mastered other
[01:27:55] 50-minute guide again that's cool though
[01:27:59] I'm sure that the Temple of Silence has
[01:28:00] a whole Archive of Secrets one of his
[01:28:03] other talents will also increase the
[01:28:05] damage dealt by a shadowpierce shot for
[01:28:07] a period of time based on his Elemental
[01:28:09] Mastery okay all right sounds like the
[01:28:12] Temple of Sal is a real impressive
[01:28:13] Legacy sorry I didn't mean to
[01:28:16] scream well he's Fring reactions get
[01:28:18] your D supports ready Heritage he's
[01:28:20] similar to coland in that sense yeah

[01:35:04] it's already pinned in chat that was
[01:35:06] sick
[01:35:08] the the song was actually um was really
[01:35:13] good and the animation was really good
[01:35:26] D I don't know what to
[01:35:28] say yeah I know who the singer is but I
[01:35:31] don't know how to pronounce their name
[01:35:32] so I just don't say it in French it's m
[01:35:35] but I know that's not what their name is
[01:35:38] dude that is that
[01:35:40] was it's weird cuz like we didn't even
[01:35:42] see much but in the little we saw like I
[01:35:45] don't know how to explain it it like it
[01:35:46] tickled my heart and like I usually
[01:35:49] don't feel like emotions while watching
[01:35:52] like anime I don't know maybe it's just
[01:35:54] cuz I've been playing genin for so long
[01:35:55] I don't
[01:35:56] know I liked it
[01:36:08] though oh it was
[01:36:12] good I still think I'd rather have D
[01:36:17] Leaf about time we introduce this domain
[01:36:20] behind us on the challenge I'm so ready
[01:36:23] please be real please be real please be
[01:36:26] real the location of this challenge
[01:36:28] seems pretty intriguing Pon and the
[01:36:31] traveler discovered a secret room within
[01:36:33] the monat library and they've received
[01:36:35] an invitation to participate in a
[01:36:37] mysterious performance I love secret
[01:36:40] rooms and libraries I've always wanted
[01:36:42] one so that's right the allnew event
[01:36:44] Imaginarium theater will become
[01:36:46] available in version 4.7 for travelers
[01:36:49] who are Adventure ranked 35 or higher
[01:36:51] nice wait so this is a li Library mhm
[01:36:54] wow the coolest Library I know it looks
[01:36:57] what I imagine tell me what it is yeah
[01:36:59] it kind of looks more like a Magic
[01:37:00] Castle right so cool I would live there
[01:37:04] please so Travelers will encounter a
[01:37:06] concierge in the area who calls himself
[01:37:08] Wolfie I like Wolfie I know he's so cute
[01:37:11] Wolfie he'll reveal that this room was
[01:37:13] created by a Mage and that he's waiting
[01:37:15] for a guest to take the stage he is also
[01:37:18] a poet that guest will hopefully put on
[01:37:21] a magnificent performance by becoming
[01:37:23] the main character of the mag's story
[01:37:25] bring on that main character energy mhm
[01:37:28] ooh after arriving in this room
[01:37:31] Travelers just need to interact with
[01:37:32] this strange book in order to
[01:37:34] participate in the Imaginarium theater
[01:37:36] challenge well that was fast but what
[01:37:39] kind of challenge is it you must like 14
[01:37:41] Imaginarium theater contains a series of
[01:37:44] combat challenges battle conditions now
[01:37:48] only9 Elemental that's not as hard as it
[01:37:50] participate so Travelers will have to
[01:37:52] select character who meet the
[01:37:54] requirements of the challenge oh I get
[01:37:57] it but what if we don't have enough
[01:37:58] characters in our roster who meet the
[01:38:00] requirements uhhuh good thinking but you
[01:38:03] won't have to worry about that because
[01:38:04] first off six characters will be
[01:38:07] designated as the initial lineup for
[01:38:08] each challenge trial characters will be
[01:38:11] provided for
[01:38:12] travelers characters and travelers can
[01:38:15] also we'll beat all of them with trial
[01:38:16] characters by the way to participate in
[01:38:17] the challenges that aren't restricted by
[01:38:19] the event requirements in addition
[01:38:22] Travelers can also designate a certain
[01:38:24] number of characters as supports for
[01:38:26] their friends they can also select their
[01:38:28] friends supporting characters to join
[01:38:29] their own team that's a nice way to get
[01:38:31] to try new characters right friend
[01:38:33] friends friend characters who would say
[01:38:35] no more friend so everyone going to out
[01:38:36] Wales combat friends helping each other
[01:38:39] and during the current challenge period
[01:38:41] those six designated characters who make
[01:38:43] the initial line gain Fantastical
[01:38:46] blessings this will grant 70 days is
[01:38:48] long but that implies that it rotates
[01:38:50] which isari theater challenge5 it impes
[01:38:53] it
[01:38:55] rotes yes I'm screenshotting this wait
[01:38:57] okay the Mage behind the theater must be
[01:38:59] super powerful oh super powerful and I
[01:39:02] know that everyone's probably wondering
[01:39:04] why it looked like we had to select so
[01:39:05] many characters just now but characters
[01:39:07] will consume Vigor while participating
[01:39:10] in a oh my God it's like the wa game
[01:39:11] mode so when a character's Vigor is
[01:39:14] fully depleted they will no longer be
[01:39:15] able to fight and you will have to
[01:39:17] replace them with a new character that's
[01:39:19] so good oh my God thank you I get it
[01:39:22] please be hard I mean
[01:39:24] that they well let's see what level are
[01:39:27] the enemies I saw 0 if there's 100
[01:39:30] they'll be hard and I should also
[01:39:32] mention that not all selected characters
[01:39:34] will immediately appear in your team
[01:39:36] some
[01:39:37] characters through the story what I said
[01:39:40] they can formally be added to your team
[01:39:42] at the end of an Imaginarium theater
[01:39:43] battle or when you encounter certain
[01:39:46] special events cool so assembling your
[01:39:49] team is part of the challenge yes which
[01:39:52] makes it even more fun but let me
[01:39:54] explain a little more about the special
[01:39:56] events that I mentioned Travelers can
[01:39:58] choose to spend Fantasia flowers to
[01:40:00] trigger events during the story now some
[01:40:02] events will unlock certain characters
[01:40:04] for battle and Others May trigger
[01:40:07] certain perils certain Doom so Travelers
[01:40:10] will have to choose very carefully no
[01:40:13] pressure right choose Bennett what do
[01:40:15] you mean you performance to rewards by
[01:40:18] completing challenges and finalizing
[01:40:20] their performance results the first time
[01:40:22] they complete a challenge challenge
[01:40:23] Travelers will also receive a debut
[01:40:26] performance gift presents Travelers who
[01:40:28] feel particularly confident can try to
[01:40:30] attain the star challenge condition
[01:40:32] during each stage they'll be able to
[01:40:34] obtain different levels of performance
[01:40:36] medals that correspond with the
[01:40:38] difficulty of the challenge these medals
[01:40:40] can be displayed on their profiles go
[01:40:42] ahead and show off and that's not all
[01:40:45] right Travelers can also obtain toy
[01:40:48] medals during this event which they can
[01:40:49] exchange with Wolfie the concierge in
[01:40:52] return Travelers will receive special
[01:40:54] poses for their characters when taking
[01:40:56] phone awesome Travelers will be I don't
[01:40:59] care just give me something it doesn't
[01:41:01] have to be like Cosmetics is fine just
[01:41:03] give me something me too and also more
[01:41:06] poses will be added whenever Imaginarium
[01:41:07] theater is updated yes and finally each
[01:41:10] performance in the Imaginarium theater
[01:41:12] has several difficulty levels and each
[01:41:14] one has a different number of challenges
[01:41:16] higher difficulty levels will yield even
[01:41:18] better rewards bring that's good that's
[01:41:20] good that's as Wolfie the concierge
[01:41:22] likes to say mind we don't know if this
[01:41:24] is like it seems like it won't be like
[01:41:27] that turbo hard but more of just like
[01:41:29] here's another way to get J [ __ ] like
[01:41:31] another combat mode that rotates which
[01:41:32] means it might get harder in the future
[01:41:34] I'm just saying it's probably not going
[01:41:35] to start hard because the enemies were
[01:41:36] only level 90 that's just my guess and
[01:41:38] you can borrow from wh but I could be
[01:41:40] wrong it could be super hard super easy
[01:41:42] I don't know but I'm assuming it's like
[01:41:43] in the middle to get more Primo
[01:41:46] gems just said the magic give me give me
[01:41:49] give me give me give me each month
[01:41:51] Imaginarium theater alternate updates
[01:41:55] spiral Abyss in addition the total
[01:41:57] rewards oh my God I love you has been
[01:42:00] increased from 600 was talking never
[01:42:02] mind 800 Primo

[01:42:07] available across genin impacts official

[01:42:14] changing let's see what else this
[01:42:16] version has in store free to play bow
[01:42:18] that looks cool I don't even care like I
[01:42:20] this is good but I don't even care they
[01:42:22] just announced
[01:42:23] alongside the abys I you could say you
[01:42:26] could say d is playable and I won't even
[01:42:28] okay I would
[01:42:29] care instead they'll be able to command
[01:42:32] monsters to fight in a Cooperative
[01:42:34] simulation oo the milth will be hosting
[01:42:37] a strategic war game to improve their
[01:42:40] understanding of security needs
[01:42:41] throughout tat once a month dude Abyss
[01:42:43] is once every like two
[01:42:45] months of fonus Ina Zuma's yashiro
[01:42:48] commission
[01:42:50] suu's and fontaine's special Patrol
[01:42:54] their joint exercise is intended to
[01:42:56] improve military wait let me listen let
[01:42:58] meisten the
[01:43:00] continent wow you're making this event
[01:43:02] sound really official that that was my
[01:43:04] official voice uh you know I'm just
[01:43:06] doing my best as I was saying you can
[01:43:09] play two different kinds of scenarios in
[01:43:11] the event assault scenarios and defense
[01:43:13] scenarios as special representatives to
[01:43:16] the simulation Travelers will need to
[01:43:18] analyze enemy formations and deploy the
[01:43:20] best units for completing the CH dud I'm
[01:43:22] so hyp I don't even like I don't care
[01:43:24] about this comat and deploy them within
[01:43:26] your staging area pleas be fun I hope
[01:43:29] begin the unit will automatically start
[01:43:30] attacking your opponent so sit back and
[01:43:33] I don't know if you can relax when these
[01:43:34] things are coming at you but try clearly
[01:43:36] not PE PE ooh okay okay I'm going to
[01:43:39] give this a try o braak yeah okay this
[01:43:43] how come my hilly archers got wiped out
[01:43:45] so quickly hey guys here's my guide on
[01:43:46] the new permanent end game mode just
[01:43:50] borrow a whales characters thanks for
[01:43:52] watching
[01:43:53] but the but here we we can fix it now
[01:43:56] some types of combat units are more
[01:43:57] effective against others ranged units
[01:44:00] like are vulnerable to melee units like
[01:44:02] murles but don't fret you can turn a bad
[01:44:05] situation around if you choose the best
[01:44:07] units to tackle the opponents on the
[01:44:09] battlefield just choose the best unit
[01:44:11] Zach exactly just choose the best unit
[01:44:13] choose the best unit simple fix simple
[01:44:15] fix in defense scenarios you need to
[01:44:17] deploy units to effectively counter
[01:44:19] enemies who are attacking from I mean
[01:44:21] this is cool honestly like for sure
[01:44:23] enemy unit I enjoyed the first Tower
[01:44:24] Defense to deoy comat the next time it
[01:44:27] came I found it repetitive I was like I
[01:44:28] don't want to do this but I likeed it
[01:44:30] the first
[01:44:30] time leadership skills create favorable
[01:44:34] conditions for their team and if they're
[01:44:36] successful then Travelers can obtain
[01:44:38] various rewards mhm from the Mutual
[01:44:41] Security not for everyone though it
[01:44:42] might be like you might find it boring
[01:44:44] these rewards include depends on my mood
[01:44:46] you get me Primo gems yes a crown of
[01:44:49] insight and a fourstar bow cloud is this
[01:44:53] Clash
[01:44:55] Royale okay and next up we're
[01:44:58] introducing another combat related event
[01:45:01] endless forms most Marshal o okay I'm
[01:45:04] guessing that this one is going to test
[01:45:05] some different skills you bet you in the
[01:45:08] previous event Travelers only got to
[01:45:10] simulate combat but on a real
[01:45:12] Battlefield is way more unpredictable
[01:45:15] and that's why it's important to come up
[01:45:16] with combat tactics on the Fly and take
[01:45:18] advantage but I don't want to be happy
[01:45:19] before a patch comes out cuz it might be
[01:45:21] dog [ __ ] so I'm trying not to like
[01:45:23] I'm pretending I don't care so that it's
[01:45:25] good according to the special rules of
[01:45:27] each stage I'm pretending I don't care
[01:45:29] so that it's a good thingers to defeat
[01:45:31] enemies affected by the
[01:45:34] electrocharge and that is the only
[01:45:36] comate progress towards the challenge
[01:45:38] goal now once they satisfy the
[01:45:40] requirements they'll be able to earn
[01:45:43] rewards I'm appreciating all these
[01:45:45] rewards yes I love rewards H so this is
[01:45:49] one of those challenges that requires
[01:45:50] you to strategize indeed
[01:45:53] oh okay let's move on our next I'm going
[01:45:55] to try this announcer voice and we get a
[01:45:57] seal I've gotten a report about a loud
[01:46:00] boom that just went off in a rather
[01:46:01] unremarkable part of fontain that was me
[01:46:04] I'm sorry ooh I like that it must have
[01:46:06] come from that crocodile shaped Cannon
[01:46:09] it it that thing looks pretty scary
[01:46:11] never fear viewers I wouldn't worry
[01:46:13] about it actually this cannon was
[01:46:15] modified by a Fontan engineer it's now
[01:46:18] just a toy cannon that you can use to
[01:46:19] fire Hydro bullets so why not have some
[01:46:22] fun with it oh okay why not indeed if
[01:46:25] that's the case Travelers will need to
[01:46:27] allocate energy to the cannon and choose
[01:46:29] the correct fire might be the Caff and
[01:46:31] lack of sleep but like my heart is like
[01:46:32] racing the time limit they'll even be
[01:46:34] rewarded for their a doubt in order to
[01:46:37] keep the event interesting special types
[01:46:40] of Target balls will appear dude they're
[01:46:41] playing with like they just released
[01:46:43] like a sad animation I damn near cried
[01:46:45] and they're like oh [ __ ] here's the
[01:46:46] [ __ ] uh game mode you've been asking
[01:46:48] for that's that's my kind of what do you
[01:46:51] offer me did you you can't aim brother
[01:46:52] aim lives is free anyway I'm sorry I'm
[01:46:56] sorry our next event takes place in the
[01:47:00] land of monat Travelers will encounter a
[01:47:03] familiar novelist who recently completed
[01:47:05] a new script Travelers who follow her
[01:47:08] able to embark on a wondrous journey of
[01:47:11] literature and Imagination and the
[01:47:14] script will lead travelers to mysterious
[01:47:17] locals where they will have the
[01:47:18] opportunity to earn rewards that is this
[01:47:22] movement is
[01:47:23] bullet curtain assaults from you know
[01:47:25] various mechanisms and collect enough
[01:47:27] Labyrinth coins no big deal you can I
[01:47:29] can't watch feeling also be scattered
[01:47:32] across the field o alliteration I like
[01:47:34] it if you defeat them then you can earn
[01:47:37] even more coins ooh it looks like we'll
[01:47:39] have to move really skillfully if we
[01:47:41] want to avoid all those attacks no
[01:47:43] pressure mhm but hey don't worry
[01:47:45] Travelers can take advantage of
[01:47:46] Adventure techniques to gain special
[01:47:48] Buffs so these Buffs make the hopefully
[01:47:51] can play with friends but it looks
[01:47:52] single player you'll also be able to get
[01:47:53] rewards more easily if you're smart
[01:47:55] about how you use them that sounds great
[01:47:58] so great speaking of strategies the new
[01:48:00] version will be adding more updates to
[01:48:02] the genius you know what give me it
[01:48:05] Travelers can look forward to new
[01:48:06] character cards Monster cards and action
[01:48:09] cards also I'm not going to play will be
[01:48:11] ready to challenge Travelers in the open
[01:48:13] world oh and I hope they're ready to
[01:48:16] lose well they could take a
[01:48:19] challenge oh also the lay line overflow
[01:48:21] event will also return turn in the new
[01:48:23] version so overflow let's go that was a
[01:48:25] lot of information let's take a break
[01:48:27] while we take a look at the last
[01:48:29] redemption code see you soon I already
[01:48:31] preemptively moved the code is right
[01:48:33] under
[01:48:35] me yo I'm hype is that Scara no it's not
[01:48:38] it's other
[01:48:39] cat thanks for all the new follows by
[01:48:41] the way I appreciate it I do stream most
[01:48:45] nights kind
[01:48:47] of dude I'm so
[01:48:51] hyped I'm just afraid because I feel
[01:48:53] like people are going to call it in
[01:48:54] endgame mode and then realistically it's
[01:48:56] not going to be as hard as Abyss however
[01:48:57] it rotates every month so it might get
[01:48:58] harder the only reason I say that is
[01:49:00] because they showed level 90 enemies
[01:49:02] which means it implies they have less
[01:49:03] Health than the abys
[01:49:05] enemies however more gems and more
[01:49:07] combat content is good especially if it
[01:49:10] shows that they're willing to add more
[01:49:11] things like
[01:49:15] that like if they keep adding more
[01:49:17] combat stuff well one step at a time I'm
[01:49:20] not going to I'm not going to I'm not
[01:49:21] going to start coping
[01:49:24] raids in that land copium no that's
[01:49:27] never happening but if it
[01:49:30] [Music]
[01:49:33] did it's about adaptive team building
[01:49:36] true the fact that your characters have
[01:49:38] like stamina and stuff and you can't
[01:49:40] like always use the same team and then
[01:49:41] you get like a charact like that's cool
[01:49:44] it's cooler if
[01:49:45] like you can't just steamroll through it
[01:49:50] but yeah level 90 was normal mode okay
[01:49:53] I'm not going to judge it I mean I'm
[01:49:55] hype I don't care I'm just preing just
[01:49:57] in case people expect it to be something
[01:49:59] that it's not I just don't want our
[01:50:01] expectations to be like too high or too
[01:50:03] like I'm trying to I'm trying to be a
[01:50:04] realist here because I've been hurt in
[01:50:06] the past I thought we would get free
[01:50:07] aaka we didn't I thought we would get
[01:50:09] raided we
[01:50:10] [Music]
[01:50:14] didn't let me time stamp something holy
[01:50:18] [ __ ]
[01:50:22] [Music]
[01:50:31] all right Focus up Focus up and we're
[01:50:33] back welcome back everybody we're back
[01:50:35] we're back hello hello hello welcome
[01:50:37] back to the version 4.7 special program
[01:50:41] looks like we completed this domain
[01:50:42] challenge was there ever any doubt cake
[01:50:45] if they do an teaser I'm going to have
[01:50:47] to change my pants and then I'm not even
[01:50:48] joking now it's time to tell everyone

[01:57:47] now wait really I don't I know well I
[01:57:50] don't know if that's like bad or good
[01:57:51] but I'm saying I I know my PC storage is

[01:57:55] mobile cuz I don't I don't play as much
[01:57:57] on
[01:58:00] [Music]
[01:58:04] mobile okay I know this sounds [ __ ] to
[01:58:07] say but like I am maybe seven times more
[01:58:10] hype about the end game mode than about
[01:58:11] the nland preview who meet the
[01:58:14] requirements it's like not even close
[01:58:16] but like nine cool like cool I'm excited
[01:58:19] but like one step at a time buddy why is
[01:58:21] AR Lino on wait this is actually based
[01:58:23] Exile if you don't know actually gives
[01:58:24] you energy to your whole team I'm pretty
[01:58:26] sure it's a whole team which is actually
[01:58:27] pretty
[01:58:28] cool because first off why is Crimson
[01:58:31] Moon semblance level 11 that's my
[01:58:32] characters not trial why is your arlino
[01:58:35] on a level 11 Crimson Moon
[01:58:38] semblance six characters will be
[01:58:40] designated as the initial lineup for
[01:58:42] each challenge trial characters end game
[01:58:44] question okay sorry for using the word
[01:58:45] endgame it's not like real end game but
[01:58:47] you know what I mean that are missing
[01:58:49] any of those characters and travelers
[01:58:51] can also invite special guest characters
[01:58:53] to participate in the challenge it's
[01:58:56] actually level
[01:58:58] 110 Oh you mean the weapon
[01:59:05] oh wait so what level were the
[01:59:07] enemies used to have friends now I got
[01:59:12] enemies was this normal mode they chose
[01:59:15] but what kind of challenge is it let me
[01:59:18] tell you imagine contains a series of
[01:59:21] combat challeng
[01:59:23] and the enemies were level
[01:59:25] 859 I don't know if it changes when you
[01:59:27] do hard mode but
[01:59:30] hopeing their performance results the
[01:59:33] first time they complete a challenge
[01:59:34] Travelers will also receive a debut
[01:59:37] performance gift pressure right
[01:59:41] Travelers can collect
[01:59:42] performance T reward okay so these are
[01:59:45] the ones you can get every time and it
[01:59:47] includes artifact XP which personally I
[01:59:49] think is [ __ ] sick because I've been
[01:59:51] uh I feel like I don't know I feel like
[01:59:52] you can run out of AR artifact XP if you
[01:59:55] don't uh if you do strong box so now
[01:59:58] this incentivizes strong boxing even
[02:00:00] more because we get more artifact this
[02:00:01] spe which I think is really cool Mora
[02:00:03] nice I don't know what those medals are
[02:00:04] probably for a shop and
[02:00:06] then uh Talon books which is you know a
[02:00:09] bonus by completing challenges and
[02:00:12] finalizing their performance take those
[02:00:14] the first time they complete a challenge
[02:00:16] Travelers will also receive they got six
[02:00:18] out of eight sorry a debut performance
[02:00:21] gift pres Travelers who feel part so
[02:00:24] many characters just now but characters
[02:00:26] will consume Vigor while participating
[02:00:28] in a MCH no no chat don't mention star
[02:00:31] cuz you know them okay if they see this
[02:00:33] they're going to give us [ __ ] three
[02:00:34] five stars they be like oh oh oh you're
[02:00:35] hype your hype [ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ]
[02:00:39] what's the next character Sam is added
[02:00:40] to your
[02:00:41] account legari theater combat challenge
[02:00:44] Firefly wants to fly with you
[02:00:47] boom so when a character's Vig is full
[02:00:50] let's not start that be able fight and
[02:00:52] you will have to replace them with a new
[02:00:54] character also new sh art no way is this
[02:00:56] official I get it so when you select
[02:00:59] it's just Christmas it's [ __ ]
[02:01:01] Christmas and also how well they can
[02:01:04] fill in for each other exactly evolv
[02:01:06] strategy and I should also mention that
[02:01:08] not all selected characters will
[02:01:10] immediately appear why does CH have drip
[02:01:12] characters can only be gathered by
[02:01:14] progressing through the story they can
[02:01:16] formally be added to your team at the
[02:01:18] end of an Imaginarium theater battle or
[02:01:20] when you encounter certain special
[02:01:22] events cool so assembling your team is
[02:01:26] wait what did that say what did that say
[02:01:27] that's important to know certain
[02:01:31] special choose one character to join
[02:01:33] from okay yeah so this was Bennett and
[02:01:35] Hut I remember assembling your team is
[02:01:38] part of oh no it's Bennett Shang Ling oh

[02:01:45] B with Scara Muki you could run a Scara
[02:01:48] farzon C6 TOA Bennet team that's really

[02:01:53] this is going to be so fun oh my God is
[02:01:55] going to be fun okay if it's too easy
[02:01:57] then I'll just review your accounts that
[02:01:59] suck and then it'll just be hard boom
[02:02:02] okay I'm sorry that was [ __ ] I wonder
[02:02:05] how we play Claren I assume it's with
[02:02:07] dendro but uh maybe overload too
[02:02:09] actually cuz Chevy more fun but let me
[02:02:12] explain a little more about the special
[02:02:13] events that I mentioned Travelers can
[02:02:15] choose to spend Fantasia flowers to
[02:02:17] trigger events during the story now some
[02:02:20] events will unlock certain characters
[02:02:22] for battle and Others May trigger
[02:02:24] certain perils Doom so Travelers will
[02:02:28] have to choose very carefully oh no
[02:02:30] pressure right Travelers can collect
[02:02:34] performance tour rewards by completing
[02:02:36] challenges and finalizing their
[02:02:38] performance results the first time they
[02:02:40] challenge Travelers will also receive a
[02:02:43] debut performance gift Travelers who
[02:02:46] feel particularly confident can try to
[02:02:48] attain the star challenge condition
[02:02:50] during each stage they'll be able to
[02:02:52] obtain different levels of performance
[02:02:54] medals that correspond with the
[02:02:56] difficulty of the challenge these medals
[02:02:58] can be displayed on their profile go

[02:03:09] say I don't know be cautious about that
[02:03:12] this mode though because we don't know
[02:03:13] how hard or difficult or easy it's going
[02:03:15] to be and you could also borrow
[02:03:16] characters so I don't know but I'm super
[02:03:17] excited cuz it rotates and Abyss got it
[02:03:20] changes every time Abyss literally went

[02:07:07] [Applause]
[02:07:14] [Applause]
[02:07:19] well I'm going to link I don't I don't
[02:07:21] like using an article without linking it
[02:07:23] unless I think it's some random like
[02:07:25] [ __ ] Post article source I'm going to
[02:07:27] put
[02:07:31] Source dude we're just
[02:07:34] winning Absolution and a new fivar bow
[02:07:37] silver shower heart strings will also be
[02:07:43] featured
[02:07:45] damn check out the rewards for the new
[02:07:47] game mode it's Primo
[02:07:50] JBS it's abysses watch animation again
[02:07:53] we
[02:07:56] will while participating in Imaginarium
[02:07:59] theater combat challenges so when a
[02:08:01] character's Vigor is fully depleted they
[02:08:03] will no longer be able to fight and you
[02:08:05] will have to replace them with a new
[02:08:06] character wait this is also perfect
[02:08:08] timing for me okay it's actually my
[02:08:10] [ __ ] Christmas it's perfect timing
[02:08:12] for me because I can public my unlisted
[02:08:15] video which is the which Whata five star
[02:08:17] should you pick oh my God it's [ __ ]
[02:08:20] Christmas oh my God it's Christmas it's
[02:08:23] Christmas some
[02:08:25] RR ah I get it so when you select your
[02:08:28] characters you have to pay's verse looks
[02:08:30] really cool by the way and also how well
[02:08:33] they can fill in for each other the only
[02:08:35] reason I mean you can see the link but
[02:08:36] the only reason I didn't public it yet
[02:08:38] well I wanted to upload the other video
[02:08:39] first but I need to figure out if I want
[02:08:41] to change the Jan Shin part cuz I know
[02:08:43] how to play her and everything about her
[02:08:45] I just can't tell if she's good or not I
[02:08:46] feel like no one can tell people just
[02:08:48] pretend to tell they're like yeah
[02:08:49] actually in 5 years when it's end game
[02:08:51] she's going to be good I don't know or
[02:08:53] they just put her in B here and then
[02:08:54] don't talk I should also mention that
[02:08:57] not all selected characters but I don't
[02:08:59] think I need to comment on that anyways
[02:09:00] so it's fine some characters can only be
[02:09:02] gathered by progressing through the
[02:09:04] story they can formally be added to your
[02:09:07] team at the end of an Imaginarium
[02:09:08] theater battle or when you encounter

[02:22:30] mode similar to the spiral Abyss that's
[02:22:32] also rotating and gives Primo
[02:22:35] gems three of four of the things I said
[02:22:37] are
[02:22:44] [Music]
[02:22:48] real I'm still mad they didn't let me

[02:22:53] sumaru cuz now I can't anymore any other
[02:22:55] region I like don't fit in if I'm there
[02:22:57] people will be mad at me but like I had
[02:22:59] two regions I could have been in two
[02:23:01] unless they release Canada with like
[02:23:03] chzn [ __ ] it it's in the
[02:23:07] north you're in the game though C
[02:23:12] [Music]
[02:23:14] true I am Capitano
[02:23:23] this is like this is giving me
[02:23:26] like like I feel like I've heard this
[02:23:28] like soundtrack on like Super Mario
[02:23:30] maker or something like some game like a
[02:23:32] lava level no not lava I don't know
[02:23:36] [Music]
[02:23:39] something crash B oh maybe it's actually
[02:23:41] more crash Vibe you might be right
[02:23:47] actually Banjo and Kazooie
[02:23:54] [Music]
[02:23:58] I was expecting nland to be more red
[02:24:00] brother this isn't like in in American
[02:24:02] Cinema when you go to Mexico and there's
[02:24:04] a yellow filter on the screen the other
[02:24:06] regions of the world also look normal
[02:24:09] like they look the
[02:24:10] same but I I know what you're saying
[02:24:12] like lava and [ __ ] but there was there
[02:24:14] was like a volcano honestly I I had no
[02:24:16] clue what to expect from that L I'm
[02:24:17] being honest like I but I mean I guess
[02:24:19] we can like there's going to be like a
[02:24:21] 20 minute analysis of like what
[02:24:23] everything here means uh so looking
[02:24:25] forward to that but there was lava which
[02:24:28] is
[02:24:29] [Music]
[02:24:31] cool this is just like it it reminds me
[02:24:34] of the the place where the the leway
[02:24:38] [ __ ] weapon domain is the second one
[02:24:40] that no one does ever I swear I've only
[02:24:41] done that domain like two times in my
[02:24:42] life and I've leveled like 100 weapons
[02:24:44] bottom right of the map where you get
[02:24:46] like the B Stones whatever they're
[02:24:48] called nocus Jade this looks
[02:24:52] like I mean pretty like I don't know
[02:24:54] like we've like it doesn't look like
[02:24:56] that new this looks really new though
[02:24:57] you're really swimming in lava like this
[02:24:59] looks really
[02:25:01] [Music]
[02:25:09] interesting this gives me sumaru
[02:25:14] Vibes oh that's cool though I don't know
[02:25:16] what that is is that a ship no it's not
[02:25:18] a ship
[02:25:22] [Music]
[02:25:31] I'm not going to lie I wasn't looking at
[02:25:32] the world before I was just looking at
[02:25:33] the Pokemon I'm trying to like look at
[02:25:35] it
[02:25:38] now those are some tall trees they look
[02:25:40] like mushroom
[02:25:43] Gorge it's so blocky
[02:25:52] [Music]
[02:25:56] it is but what's cool about that is that
[02:25:58] you can there's [ __ ] to do on the top
[02:25:59] and there's [ __ ] to do under I assume
[02:26:01] although it's kind of chasm esque in
[02:26:03] that
[02:26:05] regard not really but like the middle
[02:26:08] part I
[02:26:09] mean there's like a fossil over there
[02:26:12] like a dinosaur or something like that
[02:26:14] looks like a fossil right
[02:26:30] look top right wait is that [ __ ]
[02:26:41] Celestia question mark oh my fault I'm
[02:26:44] kidding I don't know what the [ __ ] that
[02:26:46] is I have no clue what that is uh
[02:26:55] new Pokemon bottom left are you talking
[02:26:57] about me are you talking about me again
[02:26:58] are you talking about me I you did that
[02:27:00] joke earlier it's not going to work
[02:27:02] [Music]
[02:27:07] again all right I'm going to stop
[02:27:08] rewatching the same thing I'm really
[02:27:10] excited about this genuinely I am uh
[02:27:12] order of excitement is as follows one is
[02:27:15] the new uh I'm not going to call it end
[02:27:17] game cuz I don't think it is but
[02:27:19] permanent game mode cool that's one two
[02:27:21] Is The nland Stuff three or honestly two
[02:27:24] might be chlorin but two and three are
[02:27:26] like that chlorin then sethos and sien
[02:27:30] depending on how good they are and
[02:27:32] stuff uh I'm kind of pissed that's dude
[02:27:35] Seth okay this is like only a guide
[02:27:37] maker take but SE if sethos actually has
[02:27:39] two viable play styles that are like
[02:27:40] built differently it's going to make the
[02:27:42] video like two years long but it's
[02:27:44] realistic it's give you the same
[02:27:45] artifact set but different weapons like
[02:27:47] if you're normal attacking you can use a
[02:27:48] normal attack bow and if you're charge
[02:27:49] attacking you can use another bow but
[02:27:53] anyways it's
[02:27:55] fine or hyper Bloom reaction that's a
[02:27:59] lot but Travelers also have another
[02:28:01] option hoo new post dude how much [ __ ]
[02:28:04] oh it's probably just what we saw
[02:28:07] right never mind shut the [ __ ] up drama
[02:28:11] this is the ceaseless
[02:28:14] drama
[02:28:16] oops
[02:28:19] drama prep phase challenge phase okay
[02:28:22] let me read this [ __ ] let me read this
[02:28:24] [ __ ] basic rule uh what is this called
[02:28:26] imag theater basic rules in each
[02:28:29] gameplay you need to select multiple
[02:28:30] characters to form a party each season
[02:28:32] of Imaginarium theater will feature
[02:28:35] three elements that is really cool the
[02:28:37] first season is pyro Electro enimo
[02:28:40] already more creative than Abyss I'm
[02:28:43] happy so far characters that meet the
[02:28:45] elemental and level requirements can be
[02:28:48] selected that means you can only use
[02:28:50] three elements which is cool this means
[02:28:52] that teams that haven't been seen before
[02:28:54] or that otherwise aren't great will be
[02:28:56] good type of thing like you can't play
[02:28:58] vaporized pyro you have to do either
[02:28:59] overload or just mono pyro for example
[02:29:03] prep phase challenge phase finalization
[02:29:05] phase and that's where you get rewards
[02:29:07] okay before the challenge begins you
[02:29:08] must select all characters six
[02:29:10] characters designed will be set as your
[02:29:12] initial principal cast at the start of
[02:29:14] each season you may also select their
[02:29:16] trial versions aside from the cast
[02:29:18] opening characters the trial by the way
[02:29:20] it's cool it's cool that you can you
[02:29:21] have access to every character aside
[02:29:23] from the opening characters you must
[02:29:26] also select multiple alternate cast
[02:29:28] members alternate cast members can be
[02:29:30] added to the principal cast by
[02:29:32] completing combat events or triggering
[02:29:34] companion events this helps to expand
[02:29:37] your party complete multiple rounds you
[02:29:39] can select from the following three
[02:29:40] types of characters one characters that
[02:29:43] meet the elemental and level
[02:29:44] requirements two Supporting Cast
[02:29:46] characters provided by friends three
[02:29:49] special guest star s a special set of
[02:29:51] selectable characters that don't meet
[02:29:53] their requirements so there's special
[02:29:55] characters in this case you pick Alan
[02:29:57] BYU there's uh and then the other ones
[02:30:00] that meet the requirements and if you
[02:30:02] want you can also y your friend friends
[02:30:04] things so if you're like a Casual Gamer
[02:30:06] and your friend is like a whale boom
[02:30:08] okay each character will start with two
[02:30:11] Vigor each time they complete a common
[02:30:13] event they lose one once exhausted they
[02:30:15] can't battle anymore so you can only use
[02:30:16] each character
[02:30:18] twice the opening characters of each
[02:30:20] season will obtain Fantastical blessings
[02:30:23] which offer Buffs not only will these
[02:30:25] Buffs be effective during the theater
[02:30:26] but they'll also take effect in your
[02:30:28] adventures outside the theater including
[02:30:30] the spiral
[02:30:34] Abyss
[02:30:46] what wait what the [ __ ]
[02:30:53] the opening characters oh it's for only
[02:30:56] the is this only for the opening
[02:30:59] characters
[02:31:01] wait or is this every
[02:31:09] Everything the buff is kind of
[02:31:10] underwhelming is it a bad take if I
[02:31:12] think it's good I feel like if the buff
[02:31:14] is too big it would kind of make some
[02:31:16] hard content a lot less hard but maybe
[02:31:18] that's just like a endgame player take
[02:31:23] if it's just the characters here I think
[02:31:24] that's really sick cuz it incentivizes
[02:31:26] them even for the abyss if it's for
[02:31:28] every character then it's kind of
[02:31:29] whatever like it's less cool in my
[02:31:32] opinion just the opening characters so
[02:31:36] these
[02:31:37] ones I think that's really cool that
[02:31:39] means that each Abyss rotation now has
[02:31:41] certain characters or teams that will
[02:31:42] artificially be better which kind of is
[02:31:45] the case now with like the blessings but
[02:31:47] that's like less or like the enemies
[02:31:49] right like some abysses make Shia really
[02:31:50] good some abysses make Shia terrible not
[02:31:52] terrible he's always my goat but like if
[02:31:54] you play him against capellia like
[02:31:56] you're just it's so
[02:31:57] annoying okay I like that if it's for
[02:32:00] only the six characters I like it if
[02:32:02] it's not it I don't dislike it but it's
[02:32:04] just a flat buff that's like not really
[02:32:07] spicy it's just like here our stats like
[02:32:10] you're not really going to yeah just
[02:32:11] make stuff easier
[02:32:24] during the challenges you can choose to
[02:32:25] trigger
[02:32:26] events to add characters to the party or
[02:32:29] gain
[02:32:31] Buffs however they can also pose
[02:32:34] risks okay
[02:32:39] um Su suable characters on rewards okay
[02:32:44] I'm trying to look at the enemies I mean
[02:32:45] those are just three hilly trolls okay
[02:32:47] whatever rewards to clear imagine you
[02:32:50] will need to complete three six eight
[02:32:52] battles respectively so eight battles
[02:32:54] for hard uh depending on your difficulty
[02:32:56] the Primo jams rewards that can be
[02:32:58] obtained in each stage are as
[02:33:00] follows first time clear 1100 each
[02:33:04] season which is like 35 days I think a
[02:33:07] month I think they said like roughly
[02:33:09] monthly
[02:33:11] 620 that is actually
[02:33:16] good that is actually good
[02:33:20] right 620 Abyss is
[02:33:23] like cob dude Abyss is 50 time 3 * 4
[02:33:30] Abyss yeah so 50 * 3 150 * 4 600 Abyss
[02:33:34] is 600 Abyss now gives 800 no you're
[02:33:37] you're click baiting
[02:33:39] me the increased
[02:33:43] Abyss it's right there oh
[02:33:46] my so now every okay let's say you C oh
[02:33:50] but is it like slower or something is
[02:33:52] the rotation different Abyss is 15 days
[02:33:54] not 1
[02:33:55] month yeah but that's better right abys
[02:33:58] resets twice
[02:34:00] now it's once a month oh now it's once a
[02:34:04] month instead okay I
[02:34:06] see so it used to be 600 * 2 per month
[02:34:09] so 1,200 now it's 620 plus 800 okay so
[02:34:13] it's only slightly more right cuz it's
[02:34:16] uh 1420 instead of 1,00
[02:34:20] wait how no this was three weeks not two
[02:34:22] right or was it two I don't know I was
[02:34:24] never like counting the days it was
[02:34:26] three
[02:34:29] weeks oh it was two okay I'm dumb wait
[02:34:32] let me I can literally check oh no I've
[02:34:34] G
[02:34:35] closed two weeks now four okay so the
[02:34:40] monthly increase now is plus 200 and 20
[02:34:44] cuz you used to get 1,200 now you get
[02:34:47] 1420 but also I feel like these are
[02:34:49] going to be easier to
[02:34:51] get complete specific changes to obtain
[02:34:53] toy medals like that's kind of whatever
[02:34:55] then complete uh not as exciting
[02:34:58] complete specific changes to obtain toy
[02:34:59] medals which can be exchanged with
[02:35:02] Wolfie for character special
[02:35:06] poses in addition you receive midlander
[02:35:09] Billet sanctifying Essence character

[02:38:48] then we're going to do a gen stream the
[02:38:49] day after we're doing another G stream
[02:38:50] like literally in a day or two probably
[02:38:54] two I I want to play I just
[02:38:59] um yeah I want to play both I need to
[02:39:02] sleep I haven't slept it's 9:30
[02:39:05] a.m. and I'm
[02:39:08] awake I started this stream by saying I
[02:39:10] slept 9 hours I lied so I'm going to go
[02:39:12] sleep I'm not going to put alarm I'm
[02:39:13] just going to chill I might upload my wa
[02:39:16] fivar video wait I just want to make
[02:39:18] sure chat okay I want to make sure what
[02:39:19] I say about J chin is true I know it's
[02:39:21] true but like wait let me review let me
[02:39:22] review it where's J Chen I also want to
[02:39:24] point out that while Karo did get cuz
[02:39:26] like I literally read every little like
[02:39:29] nook and cranny of her kit but I still
[02:39:31] don't understand if she's good or
[02:39:33] not that's not true I mean I know I just
[02:39:35] don't want to accept the reality I think
[02:39:37] she's like the definition of a b tier
[02:39:39] character but that doesn't mean they're
[02:39:40] bad or good you know B is just like B
[02:39:43] changes after the CB that both of these
[02:39:45] characters will probably receive I feel
[02:39:47] like they're like Noel like like Noel M
[02:39:48] are like yo this character is broken and
[02:39:50] then everyone else is like yeah Noel I
[02:39:51] mean she's Noel sometime in the near
[02:39:54] future potentially for launch as I am
[02:39:55] recording this video right before core
[02:39:57] gameplay and idea should be the same so
[02:39:58] here's what I have to say first of all
[02:40:00] for Jin she is very much a jack of all
[02:40:01] traits in the sense that she kind of
[02:40:02] does a bit of everything she's an on
[02:40:03] fielder who can build up Shields as she
[02:40:05] does a heavy attack with this Shield
[02:40:06] getting better and gaining more effects
[02:40:07] the longer you hold for heavy attack
[02:40:08] it's a long and somewhat clunky
[02:40:09] animation but it will make you tankier
[02:40:11] and then the shield will persist and
[02:40:12] heal your active character for either
[02:40:13] your genin or someone else if you choose
[02:40:14] to swap additionally her skill has a
[02:40:15] Parry where she won't take damage okay
[02:40:17] that was bad gameplay footage but it's
[02:40:18] okay get hit her ultimate is a form of
[02:40:19] grouping essentially the best one we
[02:40:20] have right now that can group a lot of
[02:40:21] enemies efficiently with this sort of
[02:40:22] Vortex notably being good against light
[02:40:24] and displaceable enemies against bosses
[02:40:25] or like Elite heavy enemies this won't
[02:40:27] work so keep that in mind it won't
[02:40:28] really help that much but you can be
[02:40:29] really good in a situations against a
[02:40:30] lot of light and displaceable enemies
[02:40:31] additionally it's worth pointing out
[02:40:32] that she does give you an ultimate buff
[02:40:33] on her outro skill to the next character
[02:40:34] you swap into who will gain 38%
[02:40:36] resonance Liberation damage for a set
[02:40:38] amount of time or until they swap I
[02:40:39] believe this character is nice if you
[02:40:40] want a character that you can spend time
[02:40:41] on field with that can kind of best way
[02:40:42] to do is cancel the special heavy attack
[02:40:43] and abuse the deep and outro skill dude
[02:40:45] that's what I've been [ __ ] saying I
[02:40:47] literally thank you I need needed
[02:40:49] someone to like make me not doubt myself
[02:40:51] cuz I feel like everyone tries to use
[02:40:52] her as like the all-in-one character but
[02:40:55] I swear she can work as a support if you
[02:40:57] just swap the [ __ ]
[02:41:03] out like I I saw like eight thumbnails
[02:41:06] about the character being like insane
[02:41:08] damage and like I maybe like maybe
[02:41:10] genuinely maybe I don't have her but
[02:41:11] like I feel like she's just like a like
[02:41:13] she can do a lot of things for you but
[02:41:14] you don't have to just like main DPS her
[02:41:20] I could be wrong though I I could be
[02:41:21] wrong I'm still figuring it out because
[02:41:23] it's a new
[02:41:24] game cuz you can Shield you can group
[02:41:27] you can kind of heal a little and you
[02:41:29] can buff if you outro skill
[02:41:33] anyways I love you chat I'll be live
[02:41:36] tonight again and then get after and
[02:41:38] Then star 22 stream is goingon to happen
[02:41:41] she works really good I believe that I
[02:41:43] believe
[02:41:45] that I mean I was going to say I could
[02:41:47] reexport the video and talk about the
[02:41:49] out skill more but I did point it out
[02:41:50] which I think I think I did my due
[02:41:52] diligence let me re listen to what I
[02:41:54] said additionally it's worth pointing
[02:41:55] out that she does give you an ultimate
[02:41:56] buff on her outro skill to the next
[02:41:57] character you swap into who will gain
[02:41:58] 38% resonance Liberation damage for a
[02:42:00] set amount of time or until they swap I
[02:42:02] believe this character is nice if you
[02:42:03] want a character that you can spend time
[02:42:04] on field with that can kind of do a bit
[02:42:05] of everything have some supportive
[02:42:06] capabilities do a okay amount of damage
[02:42:07] nothing insane compared to the other
[02:42:08] DPSS but it's fine especially great for
[02:42:10] Overworld content exploring and and also
[02:42:11] having I'll watch again off okay I love
[02:42:14] you chat
[02:42:15] uh Twitch TV Cox
[02:42:26] did Z end zag
[02:42:31] ended M
[02:42:45] business wait no he didn't
[02:42:57] okay let's raise the Jeff don't push
[02:42:59] yourself no I'm fine don't worry as like
[02:43:00] as long as I sleep if I stay up now I'm
[02:43:02] pushing myself but if I go sleep we're
[02:43:04] chilling we'll raise a Jeff be nice to
[02:43:09] him oh sho's playing well I didn't know
[02:43:12] that well shout out
[02:43:13] Sho that's FG
[02:43:24] capili and I did say because I recorded
[02:43:27] this from the cbt2 stuff I was thinking
[02:43:29] I might um like change anything if my
[02:43:32] opinions change on anything from live I
[02:43:35] think karo's still really good I think
[02:43:38] Vina's broken I think the other puppet
[02:43:40] girl still really good GN I might I
[02:43:41] might add some I might re-record a
[02:43:43] little part
[02:43:46] cuz maybe not do a okay amount of damage
[02:43:49] nothing insane compared to the other
[02:43:50] DPSS but it's fine especially great for
[02:43:52] Overworld content exploring and also
[02:43:53] having some grouping against lighter
[02:43:54] enemies she has some supportive
[02:43:55] capabilities with her shield and buff
[02:43:56] but can also be played as a character
[02:43:58] that can kind of solo some content a
[02:43:59] hybrid between a tank support and damage
[02:44:00] dealer if that's something that
[02:44:01] interests you personally unless they
[02:44:02] change a lot for release which again I
[02:44:04] will update in a comment I think she's a
[02:44:05] fun character and a very uni okay I'll
[02:44:07] just recap this I'll I'll do a different
[02:44:08] summary cuz I do think she almost gives
[02:44:11] me kakomi Vibes where like I feel like
[02:44:14] you don't necessarily have to like use
[02:44:16] her on field you can it might be off but
[02:44:19] I think that's not the only way you can
[02:44:20] use her okay love you chat thanks for
[02:44:23] being here there's so many viewers today
[02:44:24] I appreciate it I'll see you all in uh
[02:44:26] the next one thanks for watching
