[00:13:38] dude I don't know humidity Google it
[00:13:42] what do I look like a
[00:13:45] neuroscientist so Jeff's room's lit up
[00:13:48] in oh my [ __ ] he still unid for the
[00:13:51] bro I've done
[00:13:53] like I've done like six Auto battles so
[00:13:56] far haven't gotten one purple like legit
[00:13:57] not one
[00:14:02] anyways um because I would have I
[00:14:05] couldn't I can't prearm this cuz you
[00:14:07] needed to do the um the story quest to
[00:14:09] get it and I didn't want to do it off
[00:14:10] stream so I'm waiting I could have
[00:14:12] streamed this the quest but whatever
[00:14:14] wrong level wait dude what if I'm doing
[00:14:17] what if I'm not doing the like late one
[00:14:19] what wait yo imagine no I'm
[00:14:22] not bro I have
[00:14:25] zero oh my God I think one run then I'll
[00:14:31] pull actually I can use acon for this
[00:14:33] one there's some some of these
[00:14:35] actually yeah some of these is like
[00:14:37] annoying to Auto Battle with Aron cuz
[00:14:39] she'll alt and then do nothing like
[00:14:41] it'll take like six years if they don't
[00:14:42] debuff themselves anyways
[00:14:44] uh I don't really do I have anything I
[00:14:47] need to did the world even
[00:14:49] reset oh my God the world reset okay let
[00:14:52] me do
[00:14:55] this all right let's start things off
[00:14:57] right
[00:15:01] oh yeah I forgot today is this day no he
[00:15:04] is not a
[00:15:05] musp resist the clickbait okay he's
[00:15:09] good he's
[00:15:11] good
[00:15:14] okay what the [ __ ] is t
[00:15:25] t t
[00:15:33] I mean okay to be like really really
[00:15:36] honest well we're going to play him so
[00:15:38] we'll
[00:15:39] see please play genin this is [ __ ] true
[00:15:42] no no okay to be shut up to be
[00:15:46] honest
[00:15:48] um to be honest to be honest he's uh
[00:15:52] event is pretty insane but like we'll
[00:15:53] play him but the thing is okay insane as
[00:15:56] in he's probably the best sustain but
[00:15:59] like if you already have two good
[00:16:00] sustains he's not a worthwhile upgrade
[00:16:02] like he he's good if you don't have a
[00:16:03] good sustain but if you already have two
[00:16:06] like quo Lua fuen whatever then you
[00:16:08] don't need the upgrade it's it's not
[00:16:10] worth it
[00:16:13] um but a good healer is really or
[00:16:17] shielder is really important like it's
[00:16:19] one of the main upgrades I recommend to
[00:16:20] your account is having a five star pre
[00:16:23] Iration or Harmony uh abundance not
[00:16:25] Harmony to like not [ __ ] die but if
[00:16:28] you already have two you don't need more
[00:16:29] and also this game um respectfully
[00:16:32] respectfully I love star rail but
[00:16:34] respectfully uh I feel like new
[00:16:36] characters are a bit um X stall I feel
[00:16:41] like on average new characters are
[00:16:43] better than like a new character on
[00:16:44] average in genin which means I feel like
[00:16:46] it's more likely to get a lot of
[00:16:48] characters are more likely to get power
[00:16:49] crept in this game which means I should
[00:16:51] I think that calling any character a
[00:16:53] mustle is even more dangerous because it
[00:16:55] it's Pro like in a year that's probably
[00:16:57] not true uh well I know a year is a long
[00:17:00] time but whatever anyways we're going to
[00:17:02] start with the let me Auto
[00:17:03] Battle yes okay I literally saved these
[00:17:06] for this
[00:17:08] day I'm I'm going to keep doing this
[00:17:10] we're going to do the
[00:17:13] wh hello Mr socks reminder that 2.3 drip
[00:17:18] marketing and 2.2 live next week so you
[00:17:21] better do the quest if you don't want to
[00:17:23] okay well I'm going to cream how about
[00:17:25] that how about that and then I'm going
[00:17:27] to I'm not going to pound I'm not gonna
[00:17:29] Hound I'm gonna round wait I already
[00:17:32] guessed R I'm [ __ ] stupid am I not
[00:17:34] I'm stupid fight it's fine I got it t i
[00:17:39] h
[00:17:41] e oh eight no what
[00:17:45] e
[00:17:47] Oh
[00:17:50] Tie yo I don't even know what that word
[00:17:52] means I just know it's a farm in
[00:17:54] RuneScape okay W that's all that's
[00:17:56] literally all I know what does that even
[00:17:58] mean
[00:18:00] typ one tenth of annual produce or
[00:18:02] earnings oh like a tenth a
[00:18:05] TI venturing is also
[00:18:16] imaginary okay well that's also dude
[00:18:18] runescape's the only reason I know
[00:18:20] different like breeds of trees okay not
[00:18:22] breeds Brands what are they called like
[00:18:24] uh
[00:18:26] species tree types
[00:18:30] path whatever species I don't know is
[00:18:33] this almost
[00:18:35] dead how long dude surely I'm not like
[00:18:39] bad at the
[00:18:40] game I had Argy here but my Argent is
[00:18:43] not even built so I was well he was
[00:18:45] built but I unbuilt him okay whatever
[00:18:47] it's fine uh let me let me
[00:18:52] start
[00:18:56] okay okay I still didn't get purple
[00:19:04] what's the trace priority for Aventure
[00:19:06] Trace priority you go uh uh uh Talent
[00:19:08] skill and then uninstall in that order
[00:19:11] no I'm kidding Talent skill and then you
[00:19:12] can do alt if you want well you should
[00:19:14] do
[00:19:15] alt but it's it's less important talent
[00:19:18] and skill are both good
[00:19:25] [Music]
[00:19:32] or it could be uh it's probably I'm
[00:19:34] pretty sure it's skill before Talent by
[00:19:35] the way I just said both as in both are
[00:19:37] good but I can check in a minute but
[00:19:39] both are pretty similar I'm pretty sure
[00:19:41] skill is a bit better anyways let's pull
[00:19:44] from
[00:19:47] um claim all [ __ ] it oh [ __ ] never

[00:20:35] could have been even like this I
[00:20:36] expected this to be

[00:23:30] like that good the only the only like
[00:23:32] cone I'm like pull it or go to jail is
[00:23:34] [ __ ]
[00:23:36] acaron anyways let's
[00:23:39] pull like acon is like do not collect go
[00:23:43] do not [ __ ] do not go collect do not

[00:24:05] BOS and a bunch of wels and a br so we
[00:24:08] want claraa himo or japar if we lose the
[00:24:12] academy and Mr steamer for this future
[00:24:14] not skill issue uh I'm not getting Ying
[00:24:17] so either we win the 50/50 and cool or
[00:24:20] we lose and get claraa or himo or japar
[00:24:23] those are the two good outcomes and then
[00:24:25] the final outcome is something gets
[00:24:27] broken we're going to do our first
[00:24:28] temple I think I'm on like zero pity
[00:24:31] we're also not guaranteed because yeah I
[00:24:34] got acaron last full like I didn't keep
[00:24:39] buing okay four star are there any four
[00:24:41] stars on this banner I want I don't
[00:24:43] think so maybe lyns but I don't think
[00:24:44] I'm using her although I'd be down to
[00:24:46] get links E6 just in case okay
[00:24:49] cool it's
[00:24:51] fine like links is cool we could if we
[00:24:53] want to do like a fourar Healer thing
[00:24:59] all right is your acon E2 no she's e
[00:25:02] zero what is this
[00:25:05] unlucky still wants japar on dude it's
[00:25:09] it's at the point where it's at the
[00:25:11] point it's at the point where they
[00:25:12] release two better preservation units
[00:25:16] but I still want to use them will win
[00:25:20] 5050 I mean cute I guess but I don't
[00:25:23] know if we're using
[00:25:25] that I'd be down for more sample like on
[00:25:28] my Black Swan whom I use very often by
[00:25:31] the way has like a E2 sample icon that's
[00:25:35] it all right third 10 bolt pause to jamp

[00:30:18] me
[00:30:19] it dude oh I mean yo it's fine it's F
[00:30:26] it's not fine it's too too late I don't
[00:30:28] even want you anymore but it's fine it's
[00:30:30] fine we got him finally I mean we're
[00:30:32] pulling for a venturine so it's a bit
[00:30:34] weird cuz
[00:30:37] we I mean
[00:30:39] it's it's good it's good like I wanted
[00:30:42] him on my account it says new see how it
[00:30:44] says new it says new like I I don't have
[00:30:47] him yet now granted could I have had him
[00:30:49] earlier so that I could have actually
[00:30:50] used him before Avent read yes but at
[00:30:54] dude shut up at least we have him he's
[00:30:58] probably benched but we're we're going
[00:30:59] to use him a bit I I can make a video if
[00:31:01] I want like at least we have
[00:31:06] them wrong blonde
[00:31:14] shielder okay well let me take a
[00:31:19] screenshot well
[00:31:28] I mean I'm happy I got
[00:31:30] him
[00:31:34] um okay theoretically okay here's the
[00:31:37] situation when I would level him are you
[00:31:39] ready are you ready okay let's say so
[00:31:41] normally I'd go like aventurine wo or
[00:31:43] [ __ ] fusan Mendes right okay but what
[00:31:46] if I'm running followup attack team
[00:31:49] ratio topaz okay then I'm going
[00:31:51] aventurine with them then I also want to
[00:31:52] run an acon team but acon would also
[00:31:54] want a veterin so I use dard instead of
[00:31:58] Tren because he gives me an extra debuff
[00:32:00] has higher innate aggro for Trend true
[00:32:03] and so therefore there's a situation
[00:32:06] where I would level
[00:32:11] him no he doesn't yes he does what are
[00:32:15] you talking
[00:32:25] about lingery Co oh lingering gold cold
[00:32:30] Iron
[00:32:33] Fist he has this no this no this no this
[00:32:38] yes Integrity
[00:32:41] true
[00:32:48] Integrity I mean I'm actually happy like
[00:32:50] I'm glad I got him finally but um it was
[00:32:52] a bit late but at least we got
[00:32:55] him damn isn't avent's base speed like
[00:33:00] 108 some [ __ ] I don't know V's [ __ ]
[00:33:04] fast 106 that's what it
[00:33:11] is okay well we got [ __ ] D I'm going
[00:33:14] to keep pulling
[00:33:16] but
[00:33:18] um wait did I even make them the oh I
[00:33:20] didn't even make the team I'm going to
[00:33:21] play
[00:33:23] today uh well there's okay I also didn't
[00:33:26] restart my PC since last night so
[00:33:28] if it's lagging don't laugh at me but uh
[00:33:30] let me make the other team I'm playing
[00:33:32] so ratio topaz probably Ronald but it's
[00:33:36] kind of flex and
[00:33:38] then let me put your part
[00:33:46] here wait I'm in Japanese what the
[00:33:55] [ __ ] can you show topaz sta are you
[00:33:58] trying to call me out as though I didn't
[00:33:59] gear her [ __ ] I gear her also
[00:34:02] normally I actually have a better piece
[00:34:05] but it's low on speed like this is like
[00:34:06] better but the thing is I want it to be
[00:34:08] faster than my ratio just so I don't
[00:34:10] know I don't I don't [ __ ] myself over so
[00:34:11] I'm running a slightly worse uh piece
[00:34:13] but it's
[00:34:14] okay it's actually not even bad it's
[00:34:17] like actually not even bad twopiece
[00:34:18] twopiece twopiece yeah you know it is
[00:34:20] what it is it that doesn't matter [ __ ]

[00:37:13] people tell me I need a defensive unit
[00:37:15] yeah it took 17 Cycles but I wasn't
[00:37:17] trying to be fair why would I need a
[00:37:19] shielder when my team of wind Dan hung
[00:37:21] yaning Luca and hook is clearly one of
[00:37:24] the best teams in the game I have skill

[00:37:27] like like hot men I especially don't
[00:37:28] like hot sexy men like aventurine who

[00:37:32] into the abyss because of their past
[00:37:34] trauma yes I could try to fix him but no
[00:37:36] I will not what do people even see in
[00:37:38] him a compx character who despite all

[00:50:11] they hit your entire team eventually
[00:50:12] just insta gets his [ __ ] uh his
[00:50:15] followup
[00:50:21] attack All
[00:50:25] In the dice have been cast Bust or wait
[00:50:30] so where's the where do I see the roll
[00:50:32] maybe I'll take it
[00:50:35] off it says three points I'm fine I
[00:50:39] guess that means I got a three but is
[00:50:41] there like does it not show the number
[00:50:42] on the dice like I was staring at the
[00:50:43] dice last time that's like I saw that it
[00:50:46] was a three but it didn't show it on the
[00:50:47] dice did
[00:50:49] it are you not alting the boss I don't
[00:50:51] know it doesn't like it's a trial
[00:50:53] doesn't really matter
[00:50:57] I
[00:50:58] see
[00:51:00] okay head your
[00:51:05] bats let's
[00:51:07] begin you know not to survive or be
[00:51:10] destroyed there is no I thought it be on
[00:51:12] the derer like somewhere
[00:51:16] ridden but now I
[00:51:23] know on followup counter yeah that's
[00:51:25] what I saw last time cuz it went from 1
[00:51:27] to seven which means we got a six but
[00:51:30] leave it to me you can also roll a seven
[00:51:32] like the max isn't six you can you can
[00:51:33] roll seven ready for
[00:51:40] another spend
[00:51:42] freely let's
[00:51:47] begin yo it's a
[00:51:49] 3,335 shield right
[00:51:51] now but he's on his L signature
[00:51:59] the dice have been cast
[00:52:01] Bust or maybe I'll take it off
[00:52:06] five enemy targets detected the max
[00:52:08] seven no I think it's Max 10 points but
[00:52:11] at seven you do the seven is what
[00:52:13] matters that's seven you do a followup
[00:52:14] attack and then you Shield your team and
[00:52:15] [ __ ] well you shield with your skill but
[00:52:17] followup uh gives a small one that
[00:52:19] stacks on the big one sure I'll play
[00:52:21] along sure I'll play along
[00:52:32] [Music]
[00:52:52] okay we actually level him and play him
[00:52:57] let me read everything make sure it's
[00:52:58] the
[00:53:00] same uh yeah debuff oh that's the
[00:53:04] ultimate yeah yeah skill
[00:53:08] yeah
[00:53:11] yeah yeah
[00:53:13] 48
[00:53:25] yeah yeah
[00:53:26] yeah where's the trace this
[00:53:34] one
[00:53:42] yeah
[00:53:45] yeah okay cage
[00:54:00] all right I'm going to need to [ __ ]
[00:54:03] turn all my green [ __ ] into other stuff
[00:54:05] cuz I only have the green ones so I I
[00:54:06] don't I'm going to have to like convert
[00:54:08] a bunch of
[00:54:10] [ __ ] but yeah leveling time also don't
[00:54:14] laugh at my credits I mean okay it's not
[00:54:16] even bad 3.6 million is like actually
[00:54:18] not even bad
[00:54:20] all it's settled then I'm going all
[00:54:24] in would you recommend leveling is
[00:54:26] normal attack for damage uh no like you
[00:54:29] get it to like [ __ ] three if you
[00:54:31] want I mean like you're normal attacking
[00:54:33] on him you can does it matter not
[00:54:47] really if you if you're if you decide to
[00:54:50] go like crit imaginary damage then you
[00:54:52] might as well um but I feel like most
[00:54:55] people are just going to go defense
[00:54:56] like I'm going to go mostly
[00:55:02] defense barely enough to Max him plus
[00:55:04] lone yeah but the thing yeah I mean like
[00:55:06] that's yeah I'm not getting zyone but
[00:55:07] also uh I knew i' Pi the right people
[00:55:10] Cal when when people like write down how
[00:55:12] much [ __ ] you need they assume you're
[00:55:14] going like max level 10 on everything
[00:55:16] like I'm not level max level 10 in every
[00:55:18] Trace day
[00:55:22] one oh yeah I still need to dude I'm
[00:55:24] gonna have to Auto Battle more of this

[00:56:33] have a second Channel video coming out
[00:56:34] uh I'll have a main chel one for Robin

[00:56:39] does anyone know this passive Trace that
[00:56:41] like uh like Shields and [ __ ] when you
[00:56:43] followup attack on an ally does it proc
[00:56:45] on his own followup or is it only Ally
[00:56:48] uh I guess if I read it again I might
[00:56:50] know
[00:56:53] no cuz I don't know
[00:56:57] only Ally yeah that's kind of what I
[00:56:59] assumed
[00:57:01] but okay thank you

[00:59:02] fine japar I don't have it I could buy
[00:59:04] it but I'm not going to buy
[00:59:07] it because March okay I mean that is
[00:59:15] true I mean this one's
[00:59:19] new
[00:59:24] e I'm not using that
[00:59:36] okay
[00:59:41] is what the [ __ ] is this song I don't
[00:59:47] know all right we're going to take all
[00:59:49] all of our relics on March uh okay my yo
[00:59:52] okay okay before you laugh okay I have
[00:59:55] listen listen I have some Flex pieces
[00:59:57] and I have some pure dog [ __ ] so it's
[00:59:59] like relatable in a way okay so okay let
[01:00:02] let me let me introduce this so let me
[01:00:04] introduce this okay we'll talk about the
[01:00:05] sets later but so like theoretically I
[01:00:09] should be going like this two piece for
[01:00:10] defense or whatever but like [ __ ] you
[01:00:12] don't talk to me it doesn't actually
[01:00:14] matter and full of attack is fine this
[01:00:16] piece okay look look look this is good
[01:00:17] 50% defense we got crit it's good this
[01:00:20] piece you know decent not amazing but
[01:00:24] it's tolerable this piece is insane 20%
[01:00:26] defense on speed boots like I just
[01:00:28] [ __ ] came uh uh the the the head
[01:00:31] piece is okay business it's okage
[01:00:34] business we have some speed we have some
[01:00:35] defense we have some crit damage it's
[01:00:36] cage business um and then ball and Rob
[01:00:41] [ __ ] suck so this one had double crit
[01:00:43] four sub stats or at least three maybe
[01:00:45] if it was three I can check the rolls
[01:00:47] yeah okay three uh and then it didn't
[01:00:49] roll crit a single time but it's still
[01:00:51] fine and then our ball uh we don't talk
[01:00:54] about this ball but it's okay I
[01:00:55] literally like tried to craft some it
[01:00:57] unlucky I did the triple Dude triple
[01:01:00] simulated Universe event I went here I
[01:01:02] literally was doing world
[01:01:04] seven it's fine
[01:01:06] though I got triple
[01:01:08] garbage
[01:01:12] classic just
[01:01:23] yeah we'll see though uh I should
[01:01:26] surely surely be able to 4K defense and
[01:01:30] if I do then the rest is easy if I don't
[01:01:32] then it's it's [ __ ]
[01:01:36] J if I if I like I just go defense boots
[01:01:39] if I need to I'll be
[01:01:46] fine where's
[01:01:49] Maro okay wait how much defense I have
[01:01:52] without defense
[01:01:54] boots oh okay we're
[01:01:56] chilling okay
[01:02:02] BG nice um I actually don't need the
[01:02:06] speed set though cuz I'm pretty sure
[01:02:07] without it yeah well I don't know the
[01:02:10] decimal unless I go on
[01:02:12] [ __ ] um what the [ __ ] is the website
[01:02:14] called the
[01:02:16] website Anka but whatever
[01:02:28] okay
[01:02:30] anyways one through3 with speed set no
[01:02:32] that's without speed set speed sets
[01:02:33] gives me more but like I don't need the
[01:02:34] extra the extra speed like it's fine
[01:02:36] it's not useless but like um anyways
[01:02:39] this this is fine we're getting crit
[01:02:40] rate from our [ __ ] major Trace like
[01:02:43] up to 48 yeah
[01:02:45] so
[01:02:48] P okay let me uh let me let me get my
[01:02:50] Trac
[01:02:54] mats M maxing for Auto Battle no but I
[01:02:57] don't have to rear him 50
[01:03:00] times we're going to we're going to do
[01:03:02] memory of
[01:03:03] chaos there's more to life we're going
[01:03:06] to do memory KS but but but like first
[01:03:08] we got to get our [ __ ] mask let me
[01:03:09] turn this [ __ ]
[01:03:13] down all will be swept okay this is loud
[01:03:16] never mind maybe maybe I was on two
[01:03:17] volume maybe it was 87 and
[01:03:20] two by the
[01:03:23] wind we're farming C with hunt
[01:03:25] characters dude I dude [ __ ] you okay I
[01:03:28] wanted to we're going to play this team
[01:03:30] I my voice was
[01:03:33] cracked truth and
[01:03:38] falsehood watch
[01:03:45] your I like playing this team cuz it it
[01:03:47] makes avent's full of attack not feel
[01:03:49] copium that's like my that's like my
[01:03:51] like logic
[01:03:56] zero
[01:03:57] points
[01:04:06] mediocre why are the boyfriends far
[01:04:09] apart okay I mean to be fair I should
[01:04:11] put aventurine in like the middle of my
[01:04:13] team so he gets like AOE whenever
[01:04:16] enemies AOE but I always I think having
[01:04:18] the sustain not at the end feels weird
[01:04:20] but I'll probably I might change it like
[01:04:23] I I don't know I like my team order to
[01:04:24] make sense but in Star it doesn't really
[01:04:28] matter that's just uh that's just my
[01:04:33] engin
[01:04:39] side
[01:04:41] Z knowledge the measure of Truth and
[01:04:45] falsehood aent gets more Stacks if he's
[01:04:48] in the middle that's what I just said
[01:04:50] sorry sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[01:04:52] sorry I just said that I I'm sorry I'm
[01:04:55] actually sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry for
[01:04:57] raising my voice I'm sorry I'm going to
[01:04:58] sit my
[01:05:00] coffee I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[01:05:04] going to sit my
[01:05:08] water sorry mobile delay oh I'm
[01:05:19] sorry okay maybe I shouldn't use the Hun
[01:05:21] team doing 13k damage for proc by the
[01:05:26] this is definitely a Auto Battle team of
[01:05:28] all time wow good job ratio you got him
[01:05:32] watch

[01:36:01] no
[01:36:02] yes sorry that was
[01:36:14] cring Triple player here I use ratio as
[01:36:18] my main Tri aventurine or ice mommy okay
[01:36:20] listen as a big ice mommy fan uh uh do
[01:36:25] you have five star healers or shielders
[01:36:28] if no get her or him Avent if yes get
[01:36:32] ice queen that's how it
[01:36:34] works like if you're playing like
[01:36:37] [ __ ] I mean if you're playing like
[01:36:39] Lyn Gallagher I'd rather have aventurine
[01:36:42] or fuan or some
[01:36:46] [ __ ] D this so cute look at
[01:36:50] him
[01:36:52] ha exist I got 6s one Avent and only
[01:36:56] lost 50/50s W I'm asking
[01:37:01] questions I'm asking
[01:37:03] questions are
[01:37:15] you I hit the
[01:37:17] mark uh-uh the dice have
[01:37:20] Bust or maybe I'll take it off bust
[01:37:29] your your carry won't carry if they're
[01:37:31] dead true I mean dude my like this is
[01:37:34] like okay I know this sounds like common
[01:37:36] sense but like unironically my biggest
[01:37:39] tip is like some characters you just
[01:37:42] [ __ ] stack HP on them even if you
[01:37:43] lose St like not DPSS like supports even
[01:37:45] if you lose stats like who the [ __ ]
[01:37:47] cares just don't die and then as long as
[01:37:48] you're clearing within like five [ __ ]
[01:37:50] Cycles you give so much time like that's
[01:37:53] what I do
[01:37:54] whenever I put her full attack she's
[01:37:55] just [ __ ]
[01:37:58] dead same like silver wolf and [ __ ] I
[01:38:01] remember I used to run a crit body H her
[01:38:03] I mean I still okay I still kind of do
[01:38:05] sometimes but like
[01:38:06] yeah I'm at the point where I'm not
[01:38:08] really dying and if I do it's a [ __ ]
[01:38:10] skill issue
[01:38:14] so I wait for the
[01:38:18] Department
[01:38:21] E activ for no counter
[01:38:29] attack another Journey
[01:38:33] Begins you can do that
[01:38:37] Enzo you're you're typically going three
[01:38:40] nil with Aron but if you like two others
[01:38:42] but if you don't like have a good one
[01:38:44] and you have a built Sparkle it's fine
[01:38:47] you don't have to like [ __ ] [ __ ] your
[01:38:48] pants you're okay all things in human
[01:38:52] creation

[02:07:10] need Okay small Yap session but I
[02:07:13] promise it'll be small are you ready are
[02:07:15] you ready are you ready are you ready
[02:07:16] are you ready are you ready okay small y
[02:07:19] session begins aventurine we got him we
[02:07:21] played him uh initial thoughts very
[02:07:24] strong one of the best if not the best
[02:07:25] sustain problem is well there's no
[02:07:27] problem but the problem is he's only
[02:07:29] like a marginal upgrade if you already
[02:07:30] have good five star sustains but if you
[02:07:32] don't then get them if you do already
[02:07:34] have like lra fushen hoo two of the
[02:07:36] three or japar two of the four then you
[02:07:38] can uh you don't need another one but if
[02:07:40] you don't have them or you want a slight
[02:07:42] upgrade especially in followup attack
[02:07:43] teams he's pretty good what the [ __ ]
[02:07:45] does he do he basically gives you jaar's
[02:07:47] Al but on his skill and you get it
[02:07:48] passively when enter the battle big ass
[02:07:50] shield and it stacks on itself and you
[02:07:53] get bonus Shields as allies full up
[02:07:55] attack and uh you uh also have decent
[02:07:58] personal damage it's not insane people
[02:07:59] clickbait his damage for some reason
[02:08:01] it's it's it's good for a sustain but
[02:08:03] it's just like you know it's like better
[02:08:05] than fushan damage it's it's decent
[02:08:07] damage it's especially good if you're
[02:08:09] buffing it in full attack teams with
[02:08:10] someone like topaz but on its own it's
[02:08:12] kind of just you know it's a
[02:08:14] bonus
[02:08:16] but
[02:08:18] but what's cool about him is you just
[02:08:20] never die uh because his Shield's
[02:08:22] [ __ ] tanky and you can stack it TW
[02:08:24] multiple well twice but you also get
[02:08:26] like mini Shields from his Trace his
[02:08:28] like Talent so um hey sock what am I
[02:08:33] supposed to build oh I got
[02:08:38] you the [ __ ] he has
[02:08:44] cologne okay anyways uh okay okay okay
[02:08:47] don't look at my build but listen and
[02:08:49] then I'll show you mine because if you
[02:08:50] just look at mine you like like question
[02:08:52] mark But like listen and then look at
[02:08:54] mine okay okay okay we we'll talk we'll
[02:08:56] talk we'll talk lone we'll talk lyone
[02:08:58] lyone I can talk about lyone I can talk
[02:08:59] about where's preservation okay this is
[02:09:01] pretty easy you basically just take
[02:09:03] something with high base defense and
[02:09:04] defense percent because you want 4,000
[02:09:06] defense why do you want 4,000 defense
[02:09:07] more isn't bad and a bit less isn't the
[02:09:09] end of the world but why one so your
[02:09:11] Shield is tanky and you don't die and
[02:09:13] two so that you get uh this where is it
[02:09:15] this one 48% crit rate for free if you
[02:09:17] have 4,000 defense it's just a free 48
[02:09:20] crit rate and that's not even the best
[02:09:22] part of high defense it's the main best
[02:09:23] part is that everything scales on
[02:09:25] defense including your damage but
[02:09:26] primarily your Shield so you just never
[02:09:28] die like that's the point but bonus
[02:09:30] damage is bonus damage so 408 crit rate
[02:09:32] is very good uh yeah he also has a
[02:09:34] debuff which is why he's good uh with
[02:09:37] someone like Dr ratio but also acaron
[02:09:38] but I'll talk about that later it's fine
[02:09:41] it's fine nja uh anyways what I was
[02:09:45] saying what I was
[02:09:49] saying why does he have a ball sack
[02:09:51] window on his shirt I'm not going back
[02:09:54] to look at that mods you know what to do
[02:09:56] I don't even have to say it I'm playing
[02:09:58] background music cuz that tilted me so
[02:10:03] much anyways uh lone stuff pretty easy
[02:10:07] dude look at how many I don't have one
[02:10:10] day I'll get five stars his signature is
[02:10:12] cracked cuz it gives uh okay it I say
[02:10:14] cracked but like you don't need it cuz
[02:10:16] there's a lot of good options but the
[02:10:17] base defense is like super high and then
[02:10:19] it gives you 40% defense and then it
[02:10:21] gives gives you crit damage uh and uh
[02:10:24] another debuff right yes another debuff
[02:10:27] that increases damage by a little bit
[02:10:28] right it's a vulnerability debuff 10%
[02:10:30] it's nice but the main thing about the
[02:10:32] lone is it just gives you so much
[02:10:34] defense that it's really good the the
[02:10:36] extra to be fair the extra debuff is
[02:10:37] really good for like acon or ratio but
[02:10:40] primarily acon but the main thing is
[02:10:42] like you don't really need it because
[02:10:44] there's actually good options unlike
[02:10:46] some other five stars for example if you
[02:10:49] have uh japar the standard like
[02:10:52] or that you can also get in the shop
[02:10:53] although it costs like Starlit or
[02:10:55] whatever it's called like the premium
[02:10:56] thing so yeah uh but if if you do have
[02:10:59] moment of Victory it's good it gives you
[02:11:00] a lot of Defense again High base defense
[02:11:02] uh 24% and another 24% when you get hit
[02:11:05] so a lot of Defense the hit rate's
[02:11:07] useless but the defense is nice
[02:11:11] um outside of
[02:11:16] that you basically just filter by base
[02:11:18] defense for the or like how much defense
[02:11:20] you're getting for the the most part so
[02:11:22] something like day one of my new life is
[02:11:23] pretty good because it gives you
[02:11:25] decently High base defense but also just
[02:11:27] some defense for free and resistance but
[02:11:29] mostly the defense is pretty nice um the
[02:11:33] what's the other likeon the the free to
[02:11:34] play no the battle pass one this is me
[02:11:36] is pretty good as well again uh even
[02:11:38] higher base defense this one's better
[02:11:40] but it's a battle pass lone and then you
[02:11:42] get 16 to 32 defense while also getting
[02:11:44] a bit more damage for your ultimate um
[02:11:47] which which is okay japar Lon also gives
[02:11:50] free Agro yeah that
[02:11:52] too
[02:11:55] um yeah there's also what's the other
[02:11:59] one the the new gacha one concer for two
[02:12:00] again defense it also gives you damage
[02:12:02] though um to your onfield characters
[02:12:05] that are shielded four to 8% which
[02:12:06] honestly isn't bad so it's just like
[02:12:08] again the base defense okay the problem
[02:12:09] with some of the lyones that have good
[02:12:11] effects the base defense isn't the
[02:12:12] highest but you get a lot of Defense
[02:12:14] percent so it's fine um especially with
[02:12:16] like super positions it's actually not
[02:12:17] bad uh it's a pretty good option so it's
[02:12:19] usually like uh if you can you choose
[02:12:22] one of the two five stars and if you
[02:12:23] can't uh the battle pass one this is
[02:12:26] concert for two the battle pass one this
[02:12:27] is me or day one of my new life are all
[02:12:30] pretty good depending on what you have
[02:12:31] and super positions the freeo play
[02:12:34] option Destiny threads for woven is also
[02:12:37] good uh the problem is it doesn't give
[02:12:40] you that much defense again there's no
[02:12:42] defense percent on it and the base
[02:12:43] defense isn't that high it's not like
[02:12:45] terrible but it's not that high so this
[02:12:48] is usually like it's free to play so
[02:12:50] it's it's like a decent option but the
[02:12:53] problem is you only really want to use
[02:12:54] this if you can get enough defense like
[02:12:56] 4k on your relics if you can then it's
[02:12:59] pretty decent because you get damage
[02:13:00] right you get up to 32% damage and
[02:13:03] effect
[02:13:04] res so cool it's pretty good but you
[02:13:07] need to make sure you have enough
[02:13:08] defense cuz if you don't then there's
[02:13:10] like way better
[02:13:11] options well I guess if you're free to
[02:13:13] play and have no four stars then no but
[02:13:14] yeah you get my point
[02:13:17] um lastly Trend again again like this
[02:13:21] base defense is actually terrible like
[02:13:23] this is 396 whereas Destiny is 463 I I
[02:13:26] said this is kind of low but this
[02:13:27] actually pretty high like in hindsight
[02:13:28] this actually not bad like 463 compared
[02:13:30] to that is really good right it's the
[02:13:31] same here 463 as well whereas um wait
[02:13:35] which one had [ __ ] higher are these
[02:13:37] all 463 I I swear one of them was higher
[02:13:39] yeah this one okay battle pass one is
[02:13:40] higher but yeah they're all fine the
[02:13:42] thing with trend
[02:13:44] is the base defense is really low it
[02:13:47] gives you defense percent which is fine
[02:13:50] um but but base defense matters more
[02:13:52] because that's what all of your defense
[02:13:53] percent like scales off of right it's
[02:13:55] still decent but the main reason it's
[02:13:58] actually good is if you're running or
[02:14:00] the main situation one it's actually
[02:14:01] good is if you're running Acron CU if
[02:14:02] you're running acon why are they so big
[02:14:05] stop stop looking if you're running
[02:14:07] Acron then the extra debuff you get when
[02:14:09] you get hit is actually really relevant
[02:14:11] with Doctor ratio it's fine too if you
[02:14:13] need an extra debuff the thing with
[02:14:14] ratio is like ratio doesn't need it as
[02:14:17] much as Aron does ratio wants like up to
[02:14:19] six but even if you're not fully like
[02:14:22] six Stacks as long as you have enough in
[02:14:24] your team which you usually can get it's
[02:14:26] fine so Tren is still good with ratio
[02:14:30] but it's especially good with Aron like
[02:14:31] Aron wants as many debuffs all the time
[02:14:34] non-stop like that ratio still wants
[02:14:36] debuffs though um I think this lyone is
[02:14:41] like um yeah the only downside is low
[02:14:45] baseed defense but it does kind of make
[02:14:46] up for it 16 to 32 defense perc I think
[02:14:49] it's good I think it's a little slept on
[02:14:51] especially
[02:14:52] because if you can get enough defense on
[02:14:54] your relics you would rather get a lyone
[02:14:56] that helps buff your team instead of a
[02:14:58] bit of personal damage with like a crit
[02:14:59] body or something right and like the way
[02:15:02] to increase your team's damage with this
[02:15:03] guy is not just give him more damage
[02:15:05] it's go a lone that like helps your team
[02:15:07] or go for a bit of speed or go for
[02:15:08] whatever so yeah I I do kind of like
[02:15:11] Trend um that's that too much Yap
[02:15:16] okay de buff also helps with new set
[02:15:19] yeah but you probably have enough in
[02:15:20] your team if you're running that set
[02:15:22] like you're not going to run that set
[02:15:23] with like a a team with no
[02:15:25] debuffs um but anyways so yeah tldr five
[02:15:30] star or high based defense with defense
[02:15:31] percent and then what that usually looks
[02:15:33] like is [ __ ] concert this is me day
[02:15:35] one and then Trend and Destiny are both
[02:15:37] pretty decent depending on the situation
[02:15:39] Destiny is free to play and tren's good
[02:15:40] with debuffs well if you need debuffs
[02:15:42] and then Relic [ __ ] easy as [ __ ] this is
[02:15:44] going to take 2 seconds are you ready
[02:15:46] are you ready are you ready are you
[02:15:47] ready literally mix and match sub stats
[02:15:49] you're welcome that's it you're welcome
[02:15:51] you're actually just welcome Knight is
[02:15:52] good cuz you get defense and then the
[02:15:54] four piece gives you the tankiest shield
[02:15:56] you can get realistically you probably
[02:15:57] don't need that though and farming this
[02:15:59] domain is kind of
[02:16:01] cringe um same with 2p speed if you want
[02:16:03] it you could just get 2p speed and if
[02:16:06] you want offensive two pieces you can
[02:16:08] you can go either um two-piece or four
[02:16:11] piece Pioneer for more damage against
[02:16:13] debuff enemies you can go two piece not
[02:16:15] four piece only two of the full up
[02:16:17] attack set and you go two piece of the
[02:16:18] imaginary set which ones you choose does
[02:16:20] not matter who cares you just want sub
[02:16:22] stats ideally I recommend going tanky
[02:16:25] before going damy cuz the difference
[02:16:27] between a full defense build and a full
[02:16:29] damage build we'll test it later but
[02:16:32] it's really not that big of a
[02:16:35] deal four piece defense doesn't impact
[02:16:38] the cap of your Shield oh yeah that's
[02:16:39] true too so I guess it doesn't really
[02:16:41] matter like it's technically the
[02:16:44] the the like the the best for your
[02:16:46] Shield but it doesn't really matter then
[02:16:48] cuz you you could just get enough
[02:16:49] defense and like skill twice or
[02:16:52] whatever but yeah
[02:16:54] anyways realistically you're just going
[02:16:56] sub stats I recommend going defensive
[02:16:58] like defense over damage but if you have
[02:17:01] enough defense and you don't like or you
[02:17:03] have good sub stats you can go for the
[02:17:04] damage sets either four Pioneer or two
[02:17:07] and same with like fall up attack and
[02:17:08] stuff and then planner [ __ ] broken K
[02:17:10] Don't Talk To Me Broken Keel or don't
[02:17:12] talk to me those are your two options uh
[02:17:14] if you choose the don't talk to me
[02:17:16] option you can go iner Salo iner salotto
[02:17:18] is not bad uh well pen okay I'll be
[02:17:21] nicer it's it's broken Kel or it's
[02:17:23] something else usually it's broken K cuz
[02:17:25] you get effect res and then you give
[02:17:26] crit damage to your entire team which is
[02:17:29] good that's cool I'd rather increase my
[02:17:30] team's damage than just my venturine
[02:17:32] damage another way to increase my team
[02:17:33] damage is peny if I'm running an
[02:17:35] imaginary damage dealer like in biter or
[02:17:37] ratio although a lot of times with the
[02:17:38] ratio you're also running topaz but um
[02:17:43] whatever as long as you're running an
[02:17:43] imaginary DPS penon is good so both of
[02:17:46] those are good based on sub stats the
[02:17:47] other alternatives are for damage you
[02:17:49] can go iner Salto for your fall up
[02:17:51] attack and ALT it's fine I would rather
[02:17:53] buff my team than buff my uh aventurine
[02:17:56] but you can go this it
[02:17:58] works alternatively if you just want
[02:18:00] defense and have good sub stats bog is
[02:18:02] okay you might get it accidentally by
[02:18:04] doing iner salotto because it gives you
[02:18:06] just 15 defense it's not the it's only
[02:18:08] 15 defense and again I would much much
[02:18:10] rather give my team 10 crit damage than
[02:18:12] give my venturine a little bit of
[02:18:14] Defense but it's fine it's fine so that
[02:18:18] that's basically it uh
[02:18:21] um
[02:18:24] yeah cool and then relics like
[02:18:28] stats okay ignore my damage set well
[02:18:30] actually it's not even bad stats is is
[02:18:32] pretty easy again you're going based on
[02:18:33] sub stats so your Relic sets don't even
[02:18:35] have to be like amazing you're literally
[02:18:36] just filtering by stats so you're going
[02:18:38] you're almost okay 99% of people you go
[02:18:42] defense body you go defense orb you go
[02:18:44] defense rope and then your boots are
[02:18:46] other defenser speat if you're in the if
[02:18:48] you already have your main priority is
[02:18:50] 4,000 defense if you have that then you
[02:18:52] start looking for other stuff well you
[02:18:54] can still go higher defense if you just
[02:18:55] want to be tanky and don't care that's
[02:18:57] fine but if you want a bit more utility
[02:19:01] past the 4K defense your number one
[02:19:03] option is speed boots enough speed to
[02:19:06] just go as much as you can it's not just
[02:19:08] for like oh you get to go more often
[02:19:10] it's also like first of all if you're
[02:19:12] running a followup attack team you get
[02:19:13] to like keep up with them um go as often
[02:19:16] as they do so that you can actually get
[02:19:18] your full like your uh your your passive
[02:19:20] talent that gets the trigger three times
[02:19:22] per turn uh where is it yeah this one
[02:19:26] you'll basically just get more Stacks
[02:19:27] you also get to go more often which
[02:19:29] means you break you do more break damage
[02:19:31] you get more skill points skill point
[02:19:33] generation is probably the main thing I
[02:19:34] should have mentioned first so all of
[02:19:35] that
[02:19:37] um is 3,000 enough no go more defense
[02:19:41] also the difference between crit and
[02:19:42] defense is not that H like your damage
[02:19:44] difference between defense and crit is
[02:19:46] really not that high like it's really
[02:19:48] not that big but the difference between
[02:19:50] a good Shi and a bad Shield is huge like
[02:19:52] you don't want to just be dying and also
[02:19:54] until 4,000 you're getting a free for
[02:19:57] like free crit rate right free
[02:19:59] 48% and even if you're over 4K it's fine
[02:20:02] and if you're a bit under it's fine too
[02:20:04] but if you're under it's not worth going
[02:20:05] for crit if you manage to get 4k or over
[02:20:09] and you're like okay I want I have
[02:20:11] enough now what do I do you can either
[02:20:13] one just be like okay I don't care I'll
[02:20:14] just be a bit tankier more defense or
[02:20:16] two this is what I recommend get some
[02:20:18] speed speed boots even without the speed
[02:20:20] set I'll take the speed set off speed
[02:20:23] boots plus my really high base speed I'm
[02:20:25] already 133 well I don't do I have speed
[02:20:27] sub sets I have two okay well okay no
[02:20:30] speed substats only speed boots I'm at
[02:20:33] 131 already so you can already hit 134
[02:20:35] super easy uh if you just like have a
[02:20:38] little bit of sub stats and that's
[02:20:41] enough for a lot of time but you can
[02:20:42] have a bit more you can have a bit less
[02:20:44] like it's not like the end of the uh of
[02:20:45] the world but that's a pretty good speed
[02:20:47] break point to go for but anyways speed
[02:20:50] is like the first thing I would go for
[02:20:51] if you have enough defense second or
[02:20:53] third is either crit or imaginary damage
[02:20:57] or err I kind of hate all three uh if
[02:21:01] you were to ask me which one I would
[02:21:03] choose realistically crit damage body or
[02:21:07] imaginary orb they're about as good you
[02:21:09] could go based on substats if you want
[02:21:10] one upgrade it's barely an upgrade like
[02:21:13] your damage genuinely isn't that much
[02:21:16] higher on crit or on imaginary compared
[02:21:19] to defense it really is realized that I
[02:21:21] haven't been listening for 1 hour okay
[02:21:24] thanks for 5 months though and er rope
[02:21:26] doesn't do that much either you get the
[02:21:28] AL more often sure but your alt isn't
[02:21:30] even like that much damage it's random
[02:21:33] you might just roll a one and then it's
[02:21:34] like okay I just spent this much time to
[02:21:36] get a one you're still not alting that
[02:21:38] often the main nice part about his alt
[02:21:40] is more break damage that's always why I
[02:21:42] like alting often it's cuz it's more
[02:21:43] break but still having a tankier shield
[02:21:46] and like if anything going for more
[02:21:48] defense or more speed I just recommend
[02:21:49] more so like it's technically okay but I
[02:21:51] usually just just go defense and if you
[02:21:55] have enough defense I would go speed and
[02:21:56] then if you want to go something else
[02:21:58] it's either crit body or imaginary orb
[02:22:00] they're about as
[02:22:01] good but I would usually just go defense
[02:22:04] like that's usually the standard and
[02:22:06] you're chilling it's not too complicated
[02:22:08] at all oh Gage but like if you're past
[02:22:11] 4,000 defense you're not taking damage
[02:22:13] you're like I want to do a bit more you
[02:22:15] can go crit you can go imaginary
[02:22:17] whatever that's fine and or speed cuz
[02:22:20] like I'm right now I'm on speed boots I
[02:22:22] have no defense like two pieces I have a
[02:22:25] fourstar light cone not even fully
[02:22:27] superimposed and I'm over 4K defense so
[02:22:30] you might have a signature you might
[02:22:31] have a huge base defense like cone like
[02:22:33] you might have some spare stats laying
[02:22:35] around which means even at low
[02:22:37] investment you can hit well lowish
[02:22:39] investment medium you can hit 4K defense
[02:22:41] and you're chilling but if you're like
[02:22:42] high investment and you just have really
[02:22:44] good artifact relics you can kind of mix
[02:22:46] and match you can go speed you can get a
[02:22:47] bit more damage or you can just more
[02:22:49] defense cool that's all and then teams
[02:22:53] he's a good sustain everywhere literally
[02:22:55] not everywhere like blade doesn't really
[02:22:57] want to shielder but almost any team can
[02:23:00] use a good sustain eventually need a
[02:23:02] good sustain where he shines and is like
[02:23:05] no a noticeable sort of increase a good
[02:23:09] like the best option type of thing would
[02:23:11] be uh notably with follow-up attackers
[02:23:15] so usually that looks like something
[02:23:17] like the standard team is kind of Dr
[02:23:19] ratio with someone like topac this is
[02:23:20] really good follow attackers you can
[02:23:22] also use like claraa you can also use uh
[02:23:24] what's what's her name heo Hera stuff
[02:23:27] like that fall attackers are good ratio
[02:23:29] and toaz is like the standard well not
[02:23:30] the standard but okay it's what I play
[02:23:32] yeah ratio and toaz but basically any
[02:23:34] follow attacker that works uh also you
[02:23:36] could use him with imaginary characters
[02:23:38] to run peny whatever like you can use
[02:23:40] with iner that's all good you can also
[02:23:42] use
[02:23:43] him F te requires signature on everyone
[02:23:46] to work well not really if you need more
[02:23:48] debuffs in like if you need more debuffs
[02:23:50] for ratio you can just run like Pila you
[02:23:52] don't need Ron May right like you could
[02:23:54] you should be fine but yeah I mean
[02:23:57] obviously it helps and um in teams like
[02:24:00] Avent what he gives you not just his
[02:24:02] Synergy with fall attackers he also
[02:24:04] gives you a debuff with his lyone or
[02:24:06] with Trend he can give you two that's
[02:24:08] pretty
[02:24:10] Pock um wait
[02:24:14] actually it's actually yeah yeah yeah so
[02:24:17] there's this one and then his ly cone
[02:24:19] gives one and then also
[02:24:21] so yeah okay I just want to make sure
[02:24:23] I'm not forgetting
[02:24:25] anything okay yeah and
[02:24:29] then yeah that's what it is yeah as E2
[02:24:31] goes another but that doesn't
[02:24:32] matter yeah so the debuffs are nice so
[02:24:35] it helps ratio but it especially helps
[02:24:37] Aron as well so that she can spam her
[02:24:39] ult but yeah if you are only getting
[02:24:43] like the one debuff without signature or
[02:24:45] Trend it is a bit inconsistent well it's
[02:24:47] not a lot of debuffs but honestly like
[02:24:49] dude I let's talked about lones lowkey I
[02:24:51] think trend is underrated cuz like a lot
[02:24:53] of the times you're overcapping on
[02:24:54] defense like if I go I might not have 4K
[02:24:57] if I go Trend do I
[02:25:01] not yeah no I don't dude this base
[02:25:03] defense is so bad so bad maybe I'm
[02:25:06] coping dude the base defense is so [ __ ]
[02:25:07] I don't know I mean it's still fine like
[02:25:10] realistically this is still better for
[02:25:11] acaron like for sure but
[02:25:15] anyways yeah like if you have the spare
[02:25:19] defense that can afford the low base
[02:25:20] defense Trend will make it a lot more
[02:25:21] consistent for Aron and arguably ratio
[02:25:24] depending on what your team is cuz like
[02:25:25] if your team doesn't have a lot of
[02:25:26] debuffs like you're not running paila
[02:25:28] then you might want it and yeah also if
[02:25:33] you're high enough investment you don't
[02:25:34] really need the shield to be that tanky
[02:25:36] so as I said or you have enough
[02:25:38] artifacts like Relic good relics on your
[02:25:40] Avent or on your team then who cares if
[02:25:42] your defense is a bit low just go Trend
[02:25:43] get another
[02:25:46] debuff and you could use the defense set
[02:25:49] the two-piece
[02:25:50] okay I'll stop yapping but yeah he he's
[02:25:52] also good for adventuring teams because
[02:25:53] he gives you those debuffs so he'll just
[02:25:54] be like basically a better like fushen
[02:25:57] there because he also has a debuff on
[02:25:59] his alt on top of being able to run
[02:26:01] Trend like fushan can and you're not
[02:26:02] going to die even if your defense is a
[02:26:03] little bit low well it you should have
[02:26:06] defense but ideally you're just killing
[02:26:07] stuff fast because you're playing a
[02:26:08] broken character oh
[02:26:10] Gage that's all I'll stop
[02:26:13] yapping I'll stop
[02:26:16] yapping I'll stop yapping no more
[02:26:18] yapping actually no more yapping
[02:26:19] actually no more yapping actually
[02:26:20] yapping it's just as I progress in my
[02:26:22] thought the more I'm liking Trend the
[02:26:25] problem is the base defense is really
[02:26:26] low though like it it's noticeable but I
[02:26:28] really do I actually am like dude I'm
[02:26:30] Trend brain roded I'm actually Trend
[02:26:31] brain Rod Trend brain Rod right now so I
[02:26:34] actually I like it more than I did
[02:26:35] before I started talking but it's
[02:26:40] okay it's still not what I go like I
[02:26:43] wouldn't go that for like the average
[02:26:44] Andy cuz if your defense is low and
[02:26:46] you're like medium investment low
[02:26:47] investment whatever you might get
[02:26:48] destroyed okay anyways uh uh gameplay
[02:26:51] time we have 11 and 12 to do we'll
[02:26:52] probably just show 12 but yeah okay okay
[02:26:56] okay chat can I unmute now
[02:27:02] dude Bro Look Around topaz in that L
[02:27:05] cone wait which one wait which one we're
[02:27:08] done yapping my throat
[02:27:10] hurts down like New York City this
[02:27:16] one oh my God wait adventur wait
[02:27:21] he's been here all
[02:27:22] [Music]
[02:27:24] along wait I actually didn't know this
[02:27:27] what the [ __ ]
[02:27:29] looking dude I didn't look anywhere else

[02:27:35] her beautiful eyes that I was looking
[02:27:38] at wait I didn't know he was here that's
[02:27:41] actually crazy he just noticed okay but
[02:27:44] dude no one's looking there what are you
[02:27:47] talking about
[02:27:54] I do
[02:27:56] me I noticed immediately okay to be fair
[02:28:00] when I got the ly cone I didn't know who
[02:28:02] Avent was cuz I don't think he was out
[02:28:03] well he definitely wasn't out he came
[02:28:04] out today what am I saying but like he
[02:28:06] wasn't out in the
[02:28:13] story okay my throat hurts from yapping
[02:28:15] so much let's actually do something
[02:28:17] Chronicle of the White Knight dream
[02:28:19] stage 11 after every attack launched by
[02:28:21] an ally apply one stack of memory
[02:28:23] imprint enemies with memory imprint
[02:28:25] receive 5% more damage this effect can
[02:28:27] stack up to six
[02:28:30] times wow pager One Singular pager not
[02:28:35] two not three one
[02:28:40] pager storms on
[02:28:44] the all right acon first

[02:29:01] not my
[02:29:03] fault I wanted to like ah it's fine it
[02:29:06] doesn't matter it doesn't
[02:29:08] matter I want a focus fire one you know

[02:36:10] bro SAS pppi ah we'll break them the
[02:36:15] measure of Truth and falsehood
[02:36:24] D we're actually like turbo
[02:36:29] tank I didn't
[02:36:31] crit what's my crit rate I
[02:36:35] wonder
[02:36:46] nice easy numby go
[02:36:50] watch your
[02:36:52] head okay
[02:36:59] okay okay 11's done all right real floor
[02:37:10] time
[02:37:12] ew dude none of these [ __ ] are weak
[02:37:14] to me
[02:37:22] now Lally no I mean I guess she's weak
[02:37:23] to Topaz kind
[02:37:28] of damn that's kind of
[02:37:32] cringe spoiled no I mean I know he's a
[02:37:37] boss yeah we'll play top half I guess
[02:37:40] although you wrote top ass
[02:37:53] you could silver
[02:37:55] wolf yeah I mean
[02:37:58] honestly we do have the skill points for
[02:38:00] her like it's
[02:38:05] fine but she's also single I mean this
[02:38:08] is a single Target team I kind of do
[02:38:10] like that idea no
[02:38:14] but then we have to swap our second
[02:38:17] team we could you can just play [ __ ]
[02:38:20] I don't know my Well's not geared no we
[02:38:23] can't
[02:38:32] actually I mean we could BL Swan I think
[02:38:36] she geared yeah she's fine okay maybe
[02:38:39] we'll do
[02:38:40] that okay okay for reference before we
[02:38:43] do
[02:38:45] 12 before we do 12 for reference okay
[02:38:49] okay for reference you saw my venturine
[02:38:51] okay you know him but uh just just for
[02:38:53] reference so we're all on the same page
[02:38:55] okay we are ratioing
[02:38:59] topaz our topaz is on her freet to-play
[02:39:02] lyone decent Relic set it's twopiece
[02:39:05] twopiece it could be a four piece same
[02:39:06] with the ratio honestly I might take
[02:39:09] Aaron's four piece my good four piece is
[02:39:10] on acaron we could say [ __ ] you acaron I
[02:39:13] kind of don't want to but I can his
[02:39:16] their ratios are actually pretty good
[02:39:18] but uh free play lone ratio is not on
[02:39:20] free play lone though but um it could be
[02:39:23] better obviously zero okay wait who's
[02:39:26] our other character [ __ ] Ron May
[02:39:28] should I
[02:39:29] swap okay I mean I don't want to dude
[02:39:33] cuz if I don't get my ALT every every
[02:39:35] three turns I'm
[02:39:39] molding do you want to enter benine LOL
[02:39:43] W he's not benched son than for three
[02:39:46] months
[02:39:50] no he is awful build okay you are coping
[02:39:53] is to me wait how is this awful look
[02:39:57] this is insane this is objectively
[02:39:59] insane this is this is mid okay that's
[02:40:01] mid fair this is pretty decent cuz it
[02:40:04] also has attack this is decently
[02:40:06] actually this is good this a lot of
[02:40:07] rolls this is okay this one's mid Fair
[02:40:10] good good mid good good mid that's two
[02:40:14] mid for good
[02:40:20] also you get bonus crit rate it's I
[02:40:22] don't have 67 I have 67 plus like 15 you
[02:40:25] get another 15 [ __ ] uh crit rate
[02:40:36] here speed on acon wait she's not on
[02:40:39] speed though is she she's not but also
[02:40:42] speed with the lon's pretty good doesn't
[02:40:44] matter though okay we're doing this half
[02:41:07] uh one second before I start
[02:41:32] o cage all right let's
[02:41:34] go uh this okay coolia is going to be
[02:41:40] easy coolia is going to be easy even
[02:41:42] though she doesn't resist us but uh this
[02:41:45] guy I don't know what the [ __ ] his
[02:41:45] mechanics are so uh it's going to be
[02:41:47] annoying it'll be fine I think
[02:41:54] okay I'm just going to send it [ __ ]
[02:41:56] it should be
[02:41:59] fine it'll be fine Gaba wait that's the
[02:42:03] wrong character Gaba
[02:42:06] whatever sound feeling lucky okay
[02:42:11] well
[02:42:14] well
[02:42:16] well well
[02:42:21] head your best every pedal all will be
[02:42:22] swept away by the wind I have no
[02:42:28] fear all right um who should we start
[02:42:33] with we'll start with this guy feel like
[02:42:35] we should we should probably break his
[02:42:36] shield though I feel like he takes no
[02:42:42] damage okay yeah I played that wrong I'm
[02:42:44] going to
[02:42:45] restart think I'm going to attack the
[02:42:47] other guy until The Shield's broken gab
[02:42:50] Gaba Gaba Gaba gam
[02:42:54] [ __ ] took too
[02:43:00] long
[02:43:02] gab Gaba okay whatever I don't
[02:43:06] care for the of
[02:43:10] mediocre exist The Shield doesn't break
[02:43:13] on its own yeah but I feel like topaz
[02:43:15] spamming her follow-ups on this guy when
[02:43:17] he's not fire we um
[02:43:20] not ideal but it doesn't
[02:43:22] matter every pedal all will be swept
[02:43:24] away by the
[02:43:28] one like I think we'll Whittle away at
[02:43:31] it I'll do
[02:43:36] this and we're running hunt characters
[02:43:38] anyways but we have some AOE with like
[02:43:40] well not really a lot of AOE but
[02:43:42] eventually it's not a
[02:43:45] lot okay we didn't crit that was
[02:43:49] not very POG
[02:43:57] [ __ ] fine that's also
[02:44:01] fine that's extra
[02:44:05] fine okay and it's broken
[02:44:08] um basic
[02:44:11] here hit my R May for energy that's fine
[02:44:14] the dice bust bust maybe I'll take it
[02:44:18] off
[02:44:20] all easy um I'm actually just going to
[02:44:23] do this break his shield and then I'll
[02:44:28] topaz
[02:44:30] go
[02:44:32] POG get him
[02:44:34] numy yo what
[02:44:36] the all right this again oh I should
[02:44:39] have hit the guy that was it's fine no
[02:44:41] it worked it work I didn't see the
[02:44:42] percent on him well he has he has a
[02:44:44] bunch of debuffs right okay I mean this
[02:44:46] guy has more yeah I should have hit this
[02:44:48] guy but it's okay
[02:44:49] uh do I need the
[02:44:51] skill no I'm fine uh there's more to
[02:44:55] life
[02:45:02] eternal stay
[02:45:04] away
[02:45:08] okay
[02:45:09] liquidation watch your
[02:45:20] okay I don't really need a new Shield my
[02:45:22] Shield's
[02:45:23] tanky just keep getting skill
[02:45:26] points minus one
[02:45:32] though Z Point okay
[02:45:36] dead coolia we meet again I still don't
[02:45:40] need the shield I
[02:45:42] think the dice have
[02:45:44] burst or maybe I'll take it off
[02:45:51] by the way aventurine kind of broken
[02:45:53] thoughts says the Jeff
[02:45:54] 77 wait since when do you think
[02:45:56] characters are broken Z what the [ __ ] I
[02:45:59] mean yeah it's true if you already have
[02:46:01] two healers though there's no real like
[02:46:03] need but he's pretty insane his shield
[02:46:05] is like super
[02:46:14] stacked the Jeff said broken no waying
[02:46:17] that's what I'm saying all right good
[02:46:20] damage well decent you know decent given
[02:46:23] our team it's not aine's fault our our
[02:46:25] our fall of attack characters aren't as
[02:46:28] geared I mean they're they're okay
[02:46:29] they're geared I'm I'm just you know I'm
[02:46:31] coping okay I didn't crit I did crit it
[02:46:32] did 39K don't talk to
[02:46:34] me TR I'm going to break that thing with
[02:46:37] the aventurine I don't think I should
[02:46:38] break with ratio though maybe I
[02:46:41] should cuz we're playing Hunt character
[02:46:43] so it doesn't really matter if he takes
[02:46:45] oh I aled before Ron Mak
[02:46:46] turn all by the
[02:46:58] WJ there's more to life wait Z who's
[02:47:00] your second healer outside of
[02:47:03] fushan I should aled before Ron ma her
[02:47:05] and that was dumb but it's
[02:47:08] fine it's not fine I'm actually very sad
[02:47:10] about it but we're going to pretend that
[02:47:12] it's fine and we're going to keep going
[02:47:13] because it happens uh Ron's after I
[02:47:16] don't need a skill point so I can just
[02:47:17] spare one I don't need to skill here
[02:47:19] though it
[02:47:26] doesn't Zer Point okay you had a level
[02:47:30] 59 Lynx as your healer yeah I always say
[02:47:35] this the biggest upgrade to your account
[02:47:36] is a five star sustain like by far but
[02:47:40] and but two of them ideally one for half
[02:47:42] once you have that though upgrading them
[02:47:43] is is kind of whatever but as far as
[02:47:46] choosing one avent's probably the go-to
[02:47:49] sure I'll play along sure I'll play
[02:47:52] along oh okay FL uh FL
[02:48:02] sh
[02:48:05] me The Shield is shielding yeah notice
[02:48:07] how we literally our Shield hasn't
[02:48:09] broken the entire time and I can't
[02:48:11] remember the last time I pressed my
[02:48:12] skill ignore that I messed up my Ron May
[02:48:15] earlier and focus on the fact that my
[02:48:17] shield has not moved like my Ron Shield
[02:48:19] is a bit low but like if it ever even
[02:48:21] comes close to Breaking I can just skill
[02:48:23] on uh I just got another one by the way
[02:48:25] from follow attacking like another mini
[02:48:27] Shield that Stacks but if I ever need to
[02:48:29] skill like look fre boom we're fully
[02:48:33] shielded

[02:58:42] fine
[02:58:44] basic I can skill here which is huge
[02:58:47] that's [ __ ] huge no [ __ ] way bra
[02:58:50] no [ __ ] way things human
[02:58:56] creation this combat needs optim this is
[02:58:59] double
[02:59:00] [Music]
[02:59:02] speed what's about to happen that's
[02:59:05] fine
[02:59:16] fne I have zero he has
[02:59:20] nine
[02:59:24] hello I mean can Aron just kill
[02:59:27] everything I wait for the
[02:59:30] Department wait I am I supposed to Al I
[02:59:32] just got
[02:59:39] nine oh if you go over Ned oh I get it
[02:59:45] okay wait wait I get it wait I get it
[02:59:52] okay I get it I get it I get it now it
[02:59:54] took like one hit I get it I get it so
[02:59:56] now it goes to four I see through you is
[02:59:59] it random what I roll though I just want
[03:00:00] to go over nine what did I roll imagine
[03:00:02] if he did the
[03:00:05] story it's
[03:00:08] all I'm so
[03:00:11] confused okay so an ally who won the
[03:00:14] gamble what exactly is winning the
[03:00:16] gamble I guess it's rolling a specific
[03:00:17] number is over nine or is it under nine
[03:00:19] maybe I want it to go over and then the
[03:00:21] ones that were low got marked cuz Aron
[03:00:24] didn't get marked and she rolled over
[03:00:26] nine so I think I that means I won how
[03:00:29] do I dude how do you roll over nine bro
[03:00:31] that's impossible you need to hit all
[03:00:33] four dises so I need okay I need my Al
[03:00:36] silver wolf is useless though [ __ ] you
[03:00:37] silver wolf you're never rolling higher
[03:00:38] than a nine nice try single Target loser
[03:00:40] remember when people were calling you
[03:00:42] better than paila I remember the kazua
[03:00:44] of star rail yeah nice try oh but genin
[03:00:46] sorry okay okay
[03:00:50] okay
[03:00:52] okay no I like Sil wolf I like no
[03:00:54] disrespect I mean she's not better than
[03:00:55] paa but I like her this is double
[03:00:58] speed yeah you you want AOE in this
[03:01:00] fight then uh I need to skill for more
[03:01:03] damage but I also need to skill there
[03:01:04] which is my acon doesn't skill and if my
[03:01:06] Acron doesn't skill you guys will type
[03:01:08] Tech W but I kind of think this is worth
[03:01:11] it wait is it cuz if I basic I mean
[03:01:13] either way I'm not breaking it in time
[03:01:15] right so I might as well just Acron yeah
[03:01:17] okay I don't think it's
[03:01:19] it cuz here I need to do this and I need
[03:01:21] to I don't get my Al oh I'm dead wait
[03:01:22] I'm actually dead yo yo it's fine I can
[03:01:26] still clear I can still clear oh no I'm
[03:01:28] dead Okay run it
[03:01:30] back yeah okay but now I know now I know
[03:01:32] it took one try to know it took one try
[03:01:35] to know also silverwolf needs to get the
[03:01:37] [ __ ] out of this team Black Swan is
[03:01:40] objectively no I'm not going to say that
[03:01:42] okay but Black Swan actually has to be
[03:01:44] better here am I am I coping if I'm
[03:01:45] coping press one but I feel like Black
[03:01:47] Swan has to be better for the
[03:01:49] AOE like Black Swan actually has to be
[03:01:51] better here okay you guys are just going
[03:01:53] to type cope but like Black Swan
[03:01:55] actually has to be better
[03:01:56] here maybe yeah maybe rolling nine was
[03:01:59] just unlucky we'll try again but maybe
[03:02:00] we go black
[03:02:03] swany detected that is
[03:02:06] insane this combat needs up this is
[03:02:09] double
[03:02:09] [Music]
[03:02:12] speed oh I didn't I weit for the
[03:02:16] depart I didn't peel up [ __ ] you black
[03:02:18] [ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ] you black swad not
[03:02:21] black swad what's her name [ __ ] you
[03:02:24] [Music]
[03:02:26] Aaron my
[03:02:29] fault my fault um I'm actually not going
[03:02:32] to skill I don't need
[03:02:41] toour is he in
[03:02:43] snared he's not ready for another
[03:02:48] to my heart a quick
[03:02:51] divination together as
[03:02:53] one now he's just flaming random dude
[03:02:56] dude that was my fault okay but I'm not
[03:02:58] going to be like oh oh [ __ ] me I'm not
[03:03:00] going to say that can I so I blame other
[03:03:04] people I blame other people for my own
[03:03:15] [Music]
[03:03:16] fault
[03:03:46] e e
[03:04:45] it to so far
[03:04:48] enemy targets detected did I not clear
[03:04:50] in two alts the first time I did this
[03:04:52] how is this so much
[03:04:53] slower
[03:04:58] and Pila the most overrated character
[03:05:01] yeah that that's almost a ban but I'm in
[03:05:03] a good
[03:05:04] mood it's actually crazy how brainwashed
[03:05:07] people are to think silver wolves better
[03:05:09] it's like it's actually like the
[03:05:11] brainwashing of the masses it's crazy
[03:05:13] it's actually crazy it's the mono
[03:05:15] Quantum propaganda for a team you're
[03:05:17] probably never
[03:05:18] playing it's actually
[03:05:21] brainwash ready for
[03:05:23] another hi press two first I press two
[03:05:27] it's fine I think this kills I'm like
[03:05:29] pretty sure this kills I'm pretty sure
[03:05:31] I'm pretty sure this kills okay it's
[03:05:32] fine that was better I got to save it uh
[03:05:35] who goes first silver wolf we'll do this
[03:05:36] and then
[03:05:45] this um
[03:05:48] okay we're actually at a pretty decent
[03:05:50] spot right now I could skill for energy
[03:05:52] cuz I'm not on whoa what the [ __ ] why
[03:05:54] does she like lean forward it's not um I
[03:05:56] don't have the lyone that gives me the
[03:05:58] energy when I basic whatever the [ __ ]
[03:06:00] it's called Uh tutorial so Skilling is
[03:06:03] actually relevant but I need to skill
[03:06:05] here I need to skill here I could basic
[03:06:07] I'm going to skill I want the
[03:06:09] energy it's
[03:06:12] fine Y and yep yin and yang both of them
[03:06:16] I don't actually need to skill because I
[03:06:18] get enough energy for my basic boom and
[03:06:19] then I can hold boom okay he's playing
[03:06:22] smart I don't have music playing wait wa
[03:06:24] I haven't heard this music yet let's
[03:06:27] listen is it
[03:06:31] good for
[03:06:33] Oblivion um I could ult but I'd rather
[03:06:35] apply a
[03:06:45] debuff I we for it's not the boss theme
[03:06:47] oh it's just
[03:06:50] Jazz a smooth
[03:06:54] criminal bomb yeah so last time I
[03:06:57] thought if you roll over nine it was
[03:06:58] like bad but you want to roll over nine
[03:07:00] I cuz it looked like it reset dude why
[03:07:02] did I roll a nine wait what's the max
[03:07:04] roll wait let's
[03:07:06] see oh it's phase one still never mind
[03:07:08] XD I'm going to skill I'm going to
[03:07:12] Al this is double
[03:07:15] speed ready for another
[03:07:18] surely I don't need the PE Al right
[03:07:21] surely I can save my PE Al and he's dead
[03:07:22] here surely right surely this [ __ ]
[03:07:25] doesn't resist all of my
[03:07:27] damage oh my God I should have feel Ed
[03:07:30] wait a
[03:07:34] quick yeah I should have PE it I thought
[03:07:36] I had more
[03:07:38] damage it's fine oh I got it okay never
[03:07:41] mind the memory chaos thing all right
[03:07:43] that's clutch we're fine that was
[03:07:44] actually really good to save it cuz I
[03:07:46] can hit all the die now I'm going to
[03:07:47] skill here for energy and
[03:07:49] then oh it doesn't
[03:07:55] matter I a six wait that's more
[03:07:59] reasonable um
[03:08:02] as this has to hit six we're hitting all
[03:08:05] of
[03:08:07] them okay easy more enemies uh truly a
[03:08:12] silver wolf moment is about to happen um
[03:08:25] I could have skill an aled but it's fine
[03:08:28] we're going to do this Silver's not
[03:08:31] dying it doesn't
[03:08:33] matter okay enemy targets detected so
[03:08:37] with paila I should I don't want to
[03:08:39] waste mild but I think I
[03:08:41] should I don't know I don't think I die
[03:08:43] but it's probably I'm just going to
[03:08:44] assume the boss mechanic's dangerous so
[03:08:47] ready for for
[03:08:48] another enemy
[03:08:50] data time for good old counter you get
[03:08:53] Al back oh I definitely should have
[03:08:54] silver wolf EQ then or e or whatever oh
[03:08:58] E3 I
[03:09:01] guess okay that was fine that was like
[03:09:03] no damage at
[03:09:05] all can I have fun next time I could
[03:09:07] have used my alts during that but I
[03:09:08] wanted to think okay uh alt comat this
[03:09:13] is double
[03:09:13] [Music]
[03:09:15] speed Al dat n Mark activ time for a
[03:09:19] good old
[03:09:21] counter alt I wait for the depart boom
[03:09:26] boom boom single Target not bad then we
[03:09:31] still then we [ __ ]
[03:09:35] still then we
[03:09:37] Al
[03:09:41] creation basic skill for energy would
[03:09:44] have been viable as well but I think
[03:09:46] he's dead in one Alt oh please don't
[03:09:48] dice me again you [ __ ] you are going
[03:09:50] to [ __ ] dice me again aren't you I
[03:09:52] hate you I actually hate you you have no
[03:09:53] friends you have no friends I thought I
[03:09:55] was your friend no no
[03:10:01] longer wait if people if we get our alts
[03:10:03] back they mean Avent also uh acon
[03:10:05] probably also does right so I just Acron
[03:10:11] alt
[03:10:14] four okay I'm dead by the way
[03:10:17] I wait for the
[03:10:19] depart why would you I mean I get it
[03:10:21] back so it doesn't
[03:10:24] matter free will or was it fate I'd
[03:10:28] rather I didn't have a skill point
[03:10:29] anyways so it's like more
[03:10:31] efficient
[03:10:36] it's oh I should have peel it first I
[03:10:38] didn't know I had it that's
[03:10:41] why okay well he's dead
[03:10:46] goodbye
[03:10:49] goodbye
[03:10:51] goodbye dude [ __ ] that
[03:10:54] boss okay but now I understand how he
[03:10:56] works so I actually think uh you just
[03:10:58] save alts for the dice phase like if I
[03:10:59] didn't have F Al the first time I would
[03:11:01] have died like the second time probably
[03:11:03] and then probably [ __ ] silver wolf and
[03:11:04] go Black
[03:11:06] Swan like unironically silver like or
[03:11:09] you can save silver wolf Al you can like
[03:11:11] e alt one and then you have to hope that
[03:11:13] your two single Target hits roll higher
[03:11:15] than whatever he rolled
[03:11:23] you get stunned if no fan cus is there
[03:11:25] wait really that's
[03:11:27] crazy we could try aventurine against
[03:11:29] that
[03:11:31] boss he's probably really good actually
[03:11:34] although I assume this guy resists
[03:11:35] imaginary but it's not like you're not
[03:11:37] really playing aventurine for his
[03:11:39] damage it doesn't you know it doesn't
[03:11:41] matter
[03:11:47] dude why is one chatter spamming T
[03:11:49] you're literally it's one guy stop
[03:11:52] manually you can't force chat to type
[03:11:55] your emote you can't force them they're
[03:11:57] not sheep my chat is not a bunch of
[03:11:59] sheep they're not just going to type T
[03:12:00] cuz you wrote
[03:12:03] T try japar my japar literally came home
[03:12:07] today he's level one what do you want me
[03:12:10] to do
[03:12:19] [ __ ] it I'm going to get him 20 for the
[03:12:20] free pull one bridge at a
[03:12:31] time H okay we'll try
[03:12:35] aventurine okay dude are you [ __ ]
[03:12:39] stupid yes I am sorry I'll stop we're
[03:12:42] gonna play Black Swan for the AOE the
[03:12:44] problem is I like running really Speedy
[03:12:46] supports with acaron
[03:12:47] um for instance my Silver's on 171 my
[03:12:50] Black Swan however is not so ideal she's
[03:12:53] only on 157 that's not even bad uh but I
[03:12:55] probably want at least 160 so I'm
[03:12:57] probably going to try to get a little
[03:12:57] bit more speed more enemies sorry that
[03:13:00] was cringe uh there you go that should
[03:13:03] be 159 okay I need two more or one
[03:13:08] more
[03:13:11] W when I see you again
[03:13:20] [Music]
[03:13:22] I mean maybe silver wolf is fine right
[03:13:25] cuz dude D okay listen silver wolf is
[03:13:29] not going to break the Dyson time silver
[03:13:31] wolf doesn't hit the Dyson time but who
[03:13:33] cares if she gets hit if paa breaks it
[03:13:35] aventurine breaks it and and and and and
[03:13:38] and and and acon breaks it and
[03:13:40] silverwolf gets hit my acon shield is
[03:13:42] Big my aventurine shield is big enough
[03:13:43] to not [ __ ] die right so like we're
[03:13:46] fine even even if one of my characters
[03:13:48] does
[03:13:55] nothing may get cced I mean he has a he
[03:14:00] like what 50 res plus um the set I'm
[03:14:04] running actually no he can't

[03:14:39] have to get through me

[03:18:39] Trend somehow that was like almost
[03:18:41] impossible and we're going to play Aron

[03:18:44] [ __ ] do I have any sagge

[03:18:54] Swan AOE actually maybe we won't play
[03:18:57] Black Swan I don't know yet first half
[03:18:58] we're going to play
[03:19:01] um wow what the [ __ ] do I play first
[03:19:05] half if only I had a quantum
[03:19:11] dps I mean I could technically still
[03:19:13] play Kafka Black Swan if I don't put um
[03:19:16] what's her name Black Swan there and
[03:19:19] then Ronald and uh ho ho or probably fan
[03:19:24] actually
[03:19:26] ah ho gives me energy which is nice but
[03:19:28] I feel like I'm going to
[03:19:33] die yeah I'm going to go fush run the
[03:19:35] the break is nice too like I value the
[03:19:38] break on all these guys honestly
[03:19:40] although energy does give you break
[03:19:42] technically so I could just
[03:19:45] go I don't know
[03:19:48] minus 14 months no cleans I have
[03:19:55] one ho ho needs intelligence to play
[03:19:59] dude what are you okay it's literally
[03:20:01] one
[03:20:03] chatter okay seven day it's one chatter
[03:20:07] but I will T I will T in your T seven in
[03:20:11] honor but
[03:20:15] yeah okay uh silver
[03:20:20] wolf and then we just implant well we
[03:20:22] don't even need to implant but
[03:20:25] yeah I'll put eventually in the middle
[03:20:27] of my team though so he tanks better

[03:28:46] for good actually no we get plus one cuz
[03:28:47] of trend lone cuz we have one spare
[03:28:49] skill point so as soon as we get hit we
[03:28:51] Al so that that guy gets nine crims and
[03:28:53] all Stacks but he has to hit my
[03:28:54] venturine or my adventurine can not
[03:28:57] apply debuff actually I forgot about

[03:29:39] another let the game begin can I have
[03:29:42] fun this care we can try that again

[03:29:45] like we lost Cycles but don't talk to me
[03:29:46] this is what matters okay this is what
[03:29:48] matters if if we can out Shield all of

[03:30:18] six and then acon goes and it's [ __ ]
[03:30:22] yeah it's
[03:30:27] nine like we lowered our aventurin
[03:30:29] damage by building them full defense but
[03:30:31] now we have TR so we get like infinite
[03:30:34] debuffs okay that was kind of

[03:35:56] soundboard oh what if we just silver
[03:35:58] wolf and Dan hung inbi
[03:36:05] Lune Daniel hung inbi
[03:36:10] Lune we implant that [ __ ]
[03:36:17] don't silver wolf on side two silver
[03:36:19] wolf on side two is like trying to drive
[03:36:21] a pickup truck without any wheels and
[03:36:23] the steering wheel is the [ __ ] Tesla
[03:36:25] rectangle one that no one likes that's
[03:36:27] what it's like you [ __ ] hit one dice
[03:36:30] that's all Sil does she hits one
[03:36:34] dice honestly lowkey this might be
[03:36:37] copium but I might want to go Black Swan
[03:36:38] err just in just so that I make sure I
[03:36:41] got my ALT back for the [ __ ] dices
[03:36:44] it's probably copium though cuz attack's
[03:36:46] better
[03:36:48] but I don't know
[03:36:52] um actually no it doesn't matter for her
[03:36:54] cuz I can just skill three things I'm
[03:36:56] actually the dumbest person in the world
[03:36:57] by the way if that was silver wolf that
[03:36:59] would be true cuz silver wolf needs the
[03:37:00] single Target but Black Swan can hit
[03:37:02] three

[04:10:56] type a message in a streamer's chat
[04:10:58] three time two times two or three and
[04:11:00] they don't answer you it's cuz they
[04:11:01] don't want to answer you realistically
[04:11:04] sometimes they don't see it but if it's
[04:11:06] two or three times they probably don't
[04:11:08] want to answer your message it might be
[04:11:10] dumb it might be irrelevant or it might
[04:11:14] not be worth the time do you want to

[04:14:05] two s knowledge the measure of Truth and
[04:14:11] falsehood can I want to be honest I
[04:14:12] don't know using hunt carries um against
[04:14:15] these enemies but it's fine we're
[04:14:17] tanky and we have full of attacks so
[04:14:20] it's it's you know there's there's some
[04:14:22] okay it's we're
[04:14:27] okay there's more
[04:14:29] to I'm one energy off cuz I have a S4
[04:14:32] lyone instead of S5
[04:14:36] thoughts let evaluation
[04:14:39] begin your answers
[04:14:48] Hunt is best against Z well I you know
[04:14:51] zero cycled this with acaron so I beg to
[04:14:54] differ but every pedal in life's all
[04:14:58] will be swept away by the
[04:15:09] wind head your BS
[04:15:13] dice have been oh I forgot his alt
[04:15:14] wasn't his followup so it's not AOE but
[04:15:16] if I roll a six then it's AOE but I'm
[04:15:18] probably not going to roll a six so I'm
[04:15:19] going to hit the Trotter whatever if I
[04:15:21] roll a six and that was a misplay please
[04:15:22] please don't roll us I rolled a one
[04:15:26] okay B is the prim actually I'm probably
[04:15:29] going to fall attack soon
[04:15:31] anyways I'll just do this
[04:15:45] I have to hit this
[04:15:52] [ __ ] sure I'll play
[04:15:57] along I'm you all guys do you have any
[04:16:00] tips yes pull for every new character or

[04:16:25] [ __ ] fuel for TL uh whatever the [ __ ]
[04:16:28] it is in this game
[04:16:29] 45 wait is it 45 or is it
[04:16:33] 50 wait what's the breako of this game I
[04:16:36] [ __ ] forget 65 okay but that's copium
[04:16:39] we've we've established this 65 is like
[04:16:42] the best but like usually when you're at
[04:16:43] like 60 there's like you hit a wall
[04:16:45] where you're like you want to use them
[04:16:46] and then you're bored so then you quit
[04:16:48] the game for like a bit or you don't
[04:16:50] it's like 50/50 on what type of player
[04:16:51] you
[04:16:55] are but yeah 60 or 65
[04:16:58] then
[04:17:00] anyways actual advice go for guaranteed
[04:17:02] upgrades before relics and then Farm
[04:17:04] relics that's the main thing I [ __ ]
[04:17:06] meant to skill and it actually didn't
[04:17:09] matter playing the long game
[04:17:14] some value I suppose existence is Unity

[04:43:34] what's happening I'll let you guys know
[04:43:36] there's going to be a second Channel
[04:43:38] adventurine
[04:43:39] video just because I want to uh for Star
[04:43:44] rail guides I'm probably going to make
[04:43:45] like full ones on on Robin and stuff and
[04:43:47] I I'll be streaming it more so I get
[04:43:48] back into it like just there's some like
[04:43:50] enemy specific stuff I I forget um and
[04:43:53] then for genin arino soon and Del guide
[04:43:55] is coming out next stream I don't know
[04:43:58] what the [ __ ] it's going to be or when
[04:43:59] but it's going to be soon cuz now
[04:44:01] there's like a bunch of [ __ ] so we'll
[04:44:03] see thanks for being here uh I'll see
[04:44:05] you all soon before we
[04:44:09] go no no
[04:44:11] what want to do TP or aboba choose your
[04:44:15] fighter personally I choose aboba but
[04:44:18] you know I think both are fine both are
[04:44:28] valid okay um what's on launch oh Fang's
[04:44:32] playing starl I bet we've been R Fang a
[04:44:34] lot but she's doing like a subathon so
[04:44:36] might as well support her cuz I I you
[04:44:38] know I respect women and Fang's the goat
[04:44:40] uh go be nice they're playing Star rail
[04:44:42] newer players so don't don't backi too
[04:44:44] much um if you're new here hello feel
[04:44:48] free to follow uh aventurine if you're
[04:44:50] wondering I think he's really good like
[04:44:51] I think he's really good he's probably
[04:44:52] the best like if I were to only get one
[04:44:55] sustain for Comfort I would choose his
[04:44:58] shield however
[04:45:02] um I don't think he's worth pulling if
[04:45:05] you already have the five stars like the
[04:45:06] other ones if you only have one you
[04:45:08] could get them you should probably but
[04:45:10] if you don't have any
[04:45:12] others um but if you have like too many
[04:45:14] like you have two or more then you
[04:45:15] probably don't need another also I did
[04:45:17] notice that like you can kind of get
[04:45:20] like in the adventuring boss fight like
[04:45:22] my other units got stunned whereas with
[04:45:24] like fuan or like a cleanser that you
[04:45:26] can like kind of negate that um but he
[04:45:29] does have a really high effect res and
[04:45:31] he gives some so
[04:45:33] like
[04:45:35] yeah and you can allow people to run
[04:45:37] broken kill because you're giving some
[04:45:38] so yeah
[04:45:46] that's
[04:45:47] it okay
[04:45:50] anyways insane in simulated Universe
[04:45:52] yeah I bet I mean we have to probably
[04:45:54] next stream we'll put them in simulated
[04:45:56] I think AG we'll probably run simulator
[04:45:58] with him next
[04:45:59] stream thanks for being here chat I love
[04:46:01] you guys be nice to Fang okay type uh
