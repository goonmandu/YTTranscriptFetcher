[00:09:23] video on her like literally in a day or
[00:09:25] two which we're going to record on
[00:09:26] stream today of us pulling for her and
[00:09:28] then a quick guide format like how I
[00:09:31] normally do for second video and then
[00:09:32] clearing and hopefully I don't skill
[00:09:34] issue Dr ratio we might go a bit more in
[00:09:37] depth the reason why Ron mayi didn't is
[00:09:39] because one I didn't feel like
[00:09:42] it um because it's [ __ ] Christmas
[00:09:45] time so I didn't want to like record
[00:09:47] during the 24th and 25th and to the
[00:09:49] people that did I'm sorry you had to do
[00:09:52] that um that's number one number like if
[00:09:55] it was like if it was like nevet it was
[00:09:57] like or or like like if there were like
[00:09:58] I would but it's it's it's like I'm not
[00:10:00] going to waste my Christmas recording so
[00:10:02] that's why but we're live so we're going
[00:10:04] to do that today uh Dr R I
[00:10:06] might uh but yeah I think that's
[00:10:12] it also I didn't really get to like look
[00:10:14] into her before she came out and I think
[00:10:16] other people did so now I'm like I did
[00:10:19] today like cuz now I like know the
[00:10:21] information but anyways we'll get into
[00:10:23] it so welcome to the stream um before we
[00:10:27] start before we start daily stalling
[00:10:31] session okay what the [ __ ] is
[00:10:34] this oh yeah second sh video is out
[00:10:36] lowkey one patch late but if you want to

[00:11:09] have but it's just an auto battle so
[00:11:11] like I've just but I cleared memory of
[00:11:12] chaos Auto Battle last patch so
[00:11:15] hopefully the resets here and there's
[00:11:17] actually new stuff so we're going to do
[00:11:19] that
[00:11:22] um but yeah that's not something to be
[00:11:24] proud of what do you mean dude wait till
[00:11:27] you guys see my relics not my rade
[00:11:28] relics my Ron May relx listen I was
[00:11:30] trying listen oh my god listen please
[00:11:33] listen please listen please don't judge
[00:11:35] a book by its cover please please please
[00:11:38] I was literally I was pre gearing Ron
[00:11:40] May right okay listen listen listen I
[00:11:44] kept rolling crit when I was trying to
[00:11:46] get break effect oh my God you don't
[00:11:49] understand my sorrow it's like it's not
[00:11:51] even bad to get crit but look look look
[00:11:52] look look I got this [ __ ] piece like
[00:11:54] like bro I wanted break effect look at
[00:11:56] this I got uh uh uh this piece as well
[00:11:59] 11 crit rate I also got dude look at
[00:12:01] these plus three pieces it had crit
[00:12:03] damage I was like okay maybe I'll get
[00:12:04] break effect got crit rate crit rate
[00:12:06] maybe I'll get break got crit damage
[00:12:07] crit rate get break effect got crit
[00:12:09] damage literally I just I want I don't I
[00:12:11] just want break effect I keep getting
[00:12:13] crit which normally I'd be happy for but
[00:12:15] I don't even know I don't even know this
[00:12:17] piece is disgusting don't talk to me
[00:12:18] about it but we got a 22 break effect
[00:12:21] glove and I wanted some speed pieces I I
[00:12:23] couldn't get speed pieces so we'll talk
[00:12:24] about it later oh also I force rolled an
[00:12:27] ER rope here in Penney land of the cream
[00:12:31] and I literally was like okay speed I'm

[00:12:40] flat defense after one crit damage
[00:12:43] roll so it's
[00:12:46] like I've been getting [ __ ] okay and I
[00:12:49] was just
[00:12:50] sad um
[00:12:54] because the thing with star rail is that
[00:12:57] there's no off piece like yenin impact
[00:13:00] and the problem with that is the
[00:13:02] following normally if I get a good piece
[00:13:05] on a wrong set like like this oh double
[00:13:07] crit oh double crit oh double crit oh
[00:13:10] use that as an off piece no big deal no
[00:13:12] big deal but my Ron May doesn't want
[00:13:14] [ __ ] crit R crit damage and neither
[00:13:15] do half my [ __ ] characters because
[00:13:17] they're not going to use thief of

[00:22:55] daily observations they seem like sealed
[00:22:57] thoughts they appear displayed
[00:22:58] flexibility on the limitations of a
[00:23:00] single path but J from their appearance
[00:23:01] I theorize they might be something to do
[00:23:03] with the garden of real collection or
[00:23:04] the enigmata why did you make me read
[00:23:07] this I don't care about

[00:25:18] good this is insane for any harmony with
[00:25:21] another uh character of the same type
[00:25:23] and then this is [ __ ] insane the
[00:25:26] hell
[00:25:31] does your balding have
[00:25:36] ICD this is also cracked by the way I
[00:25:39] don't know I have mixed feelings about
[00:25:40] this cuz I think it's broken like it's
[00:25:41] really really good but also you kind of
[00:25:44] want a lone that gives you energy on Ron
[00:25:47] May kind of but it's still pretty
[00:25:49] cracked
[00:25:55] so yeah cuz memories of the past
[00:25:59] if you have it S5 if you don't have it
[00:26:01] S5 you might want a mesh and [ __ ] uh it
[00:26:04] depends what your priority is if you
[00:26:05] want a three turn alt or not or if
[00:26:07] you're running quo you could just give
[00:26:09] yourself en it doesn't matter but uh I
[00:26:11] have an S4 like close enough not really
[00:26:14] close enough cuz it's still less energy
[00:26:17] but uh I'm running so it's
[00:26:21] fine
[00:26:23] anyways okay are you ready thanks the
[00:26:26] prime Moto teers are you
[00:26:44] ready S2 is the break point wait

[00:26:50] to get enough but I it's I don't know
[00:26:54] I'm not I didn't fully look into that
[00:26:56] this one
[00:26:58] is S5 yeah that's what I
[00:27:02] thought but also to be fair yeah it's S5
[00:27:07] with the Rope but also and um you're
[00:27:09] running panon uh but also I think like
[00:27:13] almost okay you're probably running if

[00:35:51] literally made way too many so we're
[00:35:52] going to Chu them bro I have 90 and I

[00:47:25] that not work blessed with such calm
[00:47:27] open views it is a wonderful fit for the
[00:47:30] sweet fragrance of lotus leaves plum
[00:47:33] blossom sticky rice and frosting sugar
[00:47:36] come here look the blue planet is
[00:47:39] directly below us it is so full of life

[00:48:16] become somewhat of a tradition to bring
[00:48:18] strawberry pastries When I visit Steven
[00:48:20] Lloyd his attendance seems quite
[00:48:22] dependent on them h
[00:48:26] an outstanding dessert okay what is
[00:48:28] happening G of cubed sugar one dried and
[00:48:32] salt preserved Plum
[00:48:35] blossome unfortunately there are still
[00:48:37] too many people in the space station the
[00:48:40] clamor is not fitting for desserts I can
[00:48:42] kill them all if you want it's not that
[00:48:45] hard do you remember what my research is
[00:48:49] about um nurturing life forms no my
[00:48:54] research area is short story stories
[00:48:55] about
[00:48:57] toilets what
[00:48:59] huh what's going on what am I talking
[00:49:03] about
[00:49:05] yo I see what a cute
[00:49:09] hobby but remember the next time
[00:49:11] something like this happens it's crucial
[00:49:13] to mask your expression until you've
[00:49:15] ascertained the
[00:49:16] situation if
[00:49:18] not you'll be full of weaknesses that
[00:49:20] others can see through yo yapping let's
[00:49:23] try again now

[00:49:45] give you the recipe come and have a walk
[00:49:47] with me as the mass is depart there's an
[00:49:51] enveloping CB here just like in the No
[00:49:54] Man's Land I ventured to in the
[00:49:56] past can you imagine a completely
[00:49:59] lifeless
[00:50:00] World from there you can Glimpse the
[00:50:03] stars that lie at the very edge of the
[00:50:06] Horizon following its Celestial
[00:50:08] trajectory the great teal star
[00:50:10] illuminates an Endless Sea of white
[00:50:13] across both the sky and land dude she's
[00:50:16] actually just yapping and I navigated
[00:50:18] Kong glaciers looking for signs of Life
[00:50:21] on that world and encountered many
[00:50:24] bizarre phenomena
[00:50:26] was like finding the single correct
[00:50:28] piece in a mountain of Jigsaw pieces
[00:50:30] haha I'm in front of you the process was
[00:50:32] she pushes me unimaginably difficult but

[00:51:00] I believe we will be able to be frank
[00:51:02] with each other but that needs
[00:51:06] time a surge of creativity led me to
[00:51:09] explore the cultiv in my imagination
[00:51:12] these life forms would be a new variety
[00:51:14] that are born as Geniuses lamb I don't
[00:51:16] know where it went wrong moreover my
[00:51:20] free range approach seems to have
[00:51:22] backfired do not wish for her to ask

[01:08:01] was [ __ ] permanently CCD my blade
[01:08:03] couldn't attack my jinglu couldn't
[01:08:05] attack no one could do anything
[01:08:09] deaths did something just
[01:08:14] open basic attack Ron me I can't wait
[01:08:17] why you you don't need to skill on her
[01:08:18] every
[01:08:22] turn
[01:08:26] perion
[01:08:29] Buzz I thought of one life form that
[01:08:31] would truly lie beyond my
[01:08:36] reach sorry and that is an emanator I
[01:08:41] cannot comprehend what an emanator is
[01:08:44] Scholars view them as the executors of
[01:08:47] the eon's power so when did it begin and
[01:08:51] at what point did they become closer to
[01:08:53] the Eon than any other life
[01:08:56] form at first I tried to create a genius
[01:09:00] however erudition isn't the only path in
[01:09:03] the universe if we set logic aside would
[01:09:06] there be more primitive and pure
[01:09:08] emanator on other Paths of course there
[01:09:11] would be
[01:09:14] Tason I would it is a logical decision I
[01:09:17] will certainly succeed The Entity that I
[01:09:20] reconstruct will Bloom into a life never
[01:09:22] before seen Bloom will Hera and scrum
[01:09:25] like this
[01:09:27] experiment most likely not I must hurry
[01:09:29] my work permission BR lone good for her
[01:09:35] it's I would use it on
[01:09:52] br
[01:09:57] no okay oh my bro go
[01:10:04] away what's the build will cover the
[01:10:06] whole build part right after I get the
[01:10:08] new weekly boss I just need to like
[01:10:10] actually be ready so I can do that but
[01:10:12] for uh for the most part you can get a
[01:10:13] lot of value just by going speed break
[01:10:16] effect and then some tankiness you need
[01:10:18] I believe it's 180 break effect but I'll
[01:10:20] read the talent again to make sure but
[01:10:22] you get a lot of it through your passive
[01:10:24] traces and [ __ ] so you don't actually
[01:10:26] need that much well you can get more
[01:10:27] like more isn't bad cuz you'll do more
[01:10:29] damage but that's like the what you're
[01:10:30] looking for is around at least 180 and
[01:10:33] then you want some speed so you can like
[01:10:35] keep going cuz speed's broken and then
[01:10:37] you want some tankiness like HP defense
[01:10:39] as a bonus not really a bonus cuz it's
[01:10:41] like a main stat but yeah oh oh that's
[01:10:44] Mr
[01:10:47] ratio here a genius
[01:10:50] move what
[01:10:52] a only an idiot would ask such a
[01:10:56] question just move this

[01:11:33] whether the answer to your question will
[01:11:35] be of any relevance to our current
[01:11:40] predicament if a question is of no help

[01:18:51] back there and I just wasted no yeah see
[01:18:54] I did
[01:19:00] it the quest of geniuses is over what
[01:19:03] we're doing as for the future of the
[01:19:04] simulated
[01:19:06] universe that conclusion isn't
[01:19:10] important you look upset
[01:19:15] correct I regret my actions there's no
[01:19:18] defending What I've Done time and again
[01:19:21] my experiments have fallen short and
[01:19:24] they've always yielded predictable yeah
[01:19:26] I start with the stellon hunters Ron May
[01:19:27] is like I made a clone but
[01:19:30] it doesn't hold a candle to the
[01:19:34] eminator you don't have to lie to
[01:19:38] me cuz dude at least like blade and CFA
[01:19:41] at least they're like I don't know look
[01:19:44] at them and then at least silver Wolf's
[01:19:45] a gamer you can't be mad at Silver Wolf
[01:19:47] she's just a gamer code of life could
[01:19:49] only be considered an I forgive her okay
[01:19:53] I managed to replicate the moment it was
[01:19:55] born like every living being it
[01:19:57] inevitably faced its demise as it
[01:19:59] journeyed towards the end I find no
[01:20:02] fault in
[01:20:03] that however even the briefest life
[01:20:06] should have meaning I want to know the
[01:20:09] limits of its
[01:20:13] capacity and it was a minuscule
[01:20:16] step just as I had
[01:20:19] predicted it almost ate me [ __ ]
[01:20:23] that wasn't fun I did say that if a
[01:20:25] danger proved too great for you I would
[01:20:27] personally step in to confront it I must
[01:20:30] admit I'm not fond of scenarios where
[01:20:33] everything aligns perfectly with my
[01:20:35] expectations and that's where the joy
[01:20:37] lies even the most predictable story
[01:20:40] lines can have their pleasant
[01:20:44] surprises I have to admit that these
[01:20:47] little ones born in the
[01:20:49] process sometimes move me I see a
[01:20:52] humanlike response in them it is a
[01:20:55] concept completely opposite to that of
[01:20:57] divinity emotions may be either positive
[01:20:59] or negative and they are still a long
[01:21:01] way from becoming Geniuses that being
[01:21:04] said can even Geniuses tell the
[01:21:07] difference I do not understand what love
[01:21:09] is hey hey let me were
[01:21:12] wrong no no they weren't wrong it's fine
[01:21:15] I forgive you your answer I just felt
[01:21:18] like asking the
[01:21:19] question how should I take care of them
[01:21:22] do I see IR
[01:21:23] responsible I'm sorry I am often at a
[01:21:27] loss as to how to face my own Creations
[01:21:29] the effects of the anti-truth serum will
[01:21:31] also wear off after
[01:21:33] all your memory of me will soon
[01:21:35] dissipate like no we have the VOD
[01:21:37] actually it's the VA is going to be on
[01:21:39] for like 60 days I think so to
[01:21:42] surface if I do not want a secret
[01:21:45] revealed the most fullprof ways to
[01:21:47] destroy it it won't take effect
[01:21:48] immediately perhaps you'll remember
[01:21:50] someone performs selfish experiments on
[01:21:52] the space station that way it will make
[01:21:56] our
[01:21:57] lives if that is your wish I will forget
[01:21:59] you no I won't forget you scram will

[01:43:43] don't have uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[01:43:47] heo lend me your strength
[01:43:52] to guard and defend them name one whale
[01:43:56] that's missing three five star standard
[01:44:03] characters you okay yo that that's not I
[01:44:07] just proved why I I proved my innocence
[01:44:09] you have to refute it I just proved
[01:44:11] innocent I proved
[01:44:15] it all will be swept away by the wind
[01:44:18] all will be swept away by the wind
[01:44:23] that was pretty
[01:44:28] good lend me your
[01:44:33] strength CH completed o that wasn't gr
[01:44:37] but worse better than nothing uh surely
[01:44:39] I can finish the I just want to get 888
[01:44:41] I know Talent priority is not Talent uh
[01:44:45] skill and ALT seem
[01:44:47] better this actually has to be better
[01:44:51] wait surely
[01:44:54] it's yeah you kind of
[01:44:58] want I guess it depends on your up time
[01:45:00] of
[01:45:01] alt probably alt but
[01:45:15] alt yeah yeah know you're right res pen
[01:45:17] is so [ __ ] good yeah res pen is like
[01:45:20] stupid
[01:45:22] good
[01:45:24] yeah but I kind of want to get 888 cuz
[01:45:27] that's like what I normally
[01:45:31] do so I might just do that I might just
[01:45:33] get
[01:45:38] 888 what's res pen okay so penetration
[01:45:42] okay you penetrate the resistance which
[01:45:45] means you ignore the resistance which
[01:45:47] means you do more damage wow true so
[01:45:50] like enemies will have like resistances
[01:45:52] to certain elements like they'll have
[01:45:53] like a base amount but then some enemies
[01:45:54] will be like oh resist ice 70% or 40% or
[01:45:57] whatever the percents are in this game
[01:45:58] and then you just do less damage because
[01:46:00] they resist it so having res tread means
[01:46:01] your damage is going to be way higher
[01:46:02] and it's separate from like damage
[01:46:04] bonuses so you won't get diminishing
[01:46:05] return [ __ ] because you shred the
[01:46:07] resistance on top of all the [ __ ]
[01:46:09] damage bonuses you're stacking
[01:46:13] wow so it's just basically more damage
[01:46:16] same with death shred well not they're
[01:46:17] not the same but yeah same like yeah
[01:46:31] where do I want to
[01:46:33] go also I'm pretty sure they're better
[01:46:35] to stack like damage bonuses you you get
[01:46:37] more damage bonus you diminish and
[01:46:39] return yourself but I'm pretty sure with
[01:46:40] res tread and defense tread it's like if
[01:46:42] you have both or if you have more then
[01:46:43] the more you have becomes more valuable
[01:46:46] and then you end up just doing way
[01:46:47] [ __ ] more damage cuz yeah cuz you're
[01:46:49] like yeah reduce it or ignore
[01:46:56] it um I need to do this but should I do
[01:46:59] the third weekly boss
[01:47:03] first why your hair look like scale

[01:53:25] event uh maybe so waiting for DM okay
[01:53:29] Zach archives I appreciate you and your
[01:53:31] channel but it's like so listen I'm
[01:53:34] going to be honest a lot of the messages
[01:53:36] you send seem very parasocial and I
[01:53:38] don't want to Harbor parasocial list in
[01:53:39] my community so if you're willing to
[01:53:40] accept that and you're like yo you can
[01:53:42] make your and then cuz I'd have to
[01:53:43] change the channel to my email make it
[01:53:45] basically fully mine and then I would
[01:53:47] pay like you would take the [ __ ]
[01:53:48] revenue or whatever and then it's in a
[01:53:50] non-p parasocial way then I'll do it but
[01:53:51] right now it's I'm worried because I
[01:53:53] don't want people like oh my God I love
[01:53:54] this person and then that person also
[01:53:56] works for me and then it's like a weird
[01:53:57] like Leverage thing and then it's kind
[01:53:58] of parasocial and I don't want to Harbor
[01:54:00] that which is the only reason why I

[02:01:42] messenger four piece in your team and
[02:01:43] there's so many like she gives you a
[02:01:44] speed buff and then you usually have
[02:01:46] speed on your carries and then you get
[02:01:47] like other speed Buffs it might happen
[02:01:49] like it could happen but like I feel

[02:14:58] strength in lunar
[02:15:00] flame two de on the team who does Auto
[02:15:02] BR use for Eon it should be the highest
[02:15:04] attack I know that I'm pretty sure Ting
[02:15:07] Yun does uh Al the highest energy and
[02:15:09] skill the highest attack but I'm not
[02:15:12] fully sure about Auto battle's
[02:15:13] priorities that's what I think though
[02:15:15] the Dead return
[02:15:26] or it might be like
[02:15:28] highest should always buff
[02:15:31] blade yeah but doesn't blade skill them
[02:15:35] cuz that's is that post skill or
[02:15:37] pre-kill what if blade doesn't
[02:15:38] skill does she still
[02:15:41] eblade this is double speed oh it's just
[02:15:44] always blade okay I don't actually know
[02:15:46] then okay I don't
[02:15:49] know maybe it's just whoever she thinks
[02:15:51] it's a DPS L me your
[02:15:58] strength maybe it's like highest attack
[02:16:00] unless Blade's in the party cuz blade
[02:16:02] has high he's like they're like oh what
[02:16:04] if cuz blade doesn't scale on attack so
[02:16:06] they're like well he does but a little
[02:16:07] bit so he's like oh HP scaling so then
[02:16:08] she's like I love you blade and then I
[02:16:10] don't
[02:16:14] know receive divinity High
[02:16:20] crit yeah but the other character the
[02:16:22] other DPS could have more crit than
[02:16:24] blade for example I'm 100% sure my Jing
[02:16:26] Le has more crit rate and damage than
[02:16:27] blade when she's in her enhanced state
[02:16:30] so this
[02:16:34] is
[02:16:36] Boom

[02:18:37] that explains
[02:18:43] it oo 112 fight it
[02:18:50] what's Nava's best set first of all
[02:18:53] wrong game second of all wrong stream
[02:18:56] third of all if only there was a guy
[02:18:58] telling you the answer also if we oh my
[02:19:00] God that was a lot of break
[02:19:03] damage are devils I'll crush them all
[02:19:09] engage sorry exist
[02:19:12] is all will be swept away oh we should
[02:19:15] make a Navia
[02:19:16] command
[02:19:18] add C exclamation mark
[02:19:22] Navia full Navia guide here and then I'm
[02:19:25] going to link it I'm such a genius DJ
[02:19:28] khed why did that take so many
[02:19:32] cycles do I
[02:19:35] suck okay it should
[02:19:37] work God
[02:19:39] did true he believed in
[02:19:43] US
[02:19:45] Argent I wonder what 11 and 12 are I saw
[02:19:47] I did 10 last uh last week no it was
[02:19:50] like literally like two days ago I did
[02:19:51] it and I did the Argy
[02:19:54] but okay we're going to get everyone
[02:19:55] before we do
[02:19:58] these what's the Luke's best build
[02:20:01] you're funny it'll be out soon uh uh
[02:20:03] I've been informed by my lawyers to wait
[02:20:06] for a patch and then we'll do the delute
[02:20:08] guide 4.4 delute
[02:20:13] guide true true that'll be our
[02:20:18] patch this will be my
[02:20:21] year bronia good lra dude look four
[02:20:24] characters already geared CF Argentina
[02:20:27] gear argentin geared uh kind of is This
[02:20:30] what I normally run on him I don't know
[02:20:32] actually what do I normally run on this
[02:20:33] guy like I
[02:20:34] know oh wait yeah yeah it is geared for
[02:20:38] the most part it's just I have a bad
[02:20:40] robe cuz I gave the good Rob to emiter
[02:20:43] Lune but he should be fine ratio-wise 65
[02:20:46] 139 but we get more crit rate with our
[02:20:47] traces so it's actually want more crit
[02:20:49] damage we're on Milky Way don't talk to
[02:20:51] me don't talk to me if you bring it up
[02:20:54] your band um so we wish we had more crit
[02:20:56] damage but we don't it is what it is but
[02:20:57] we can use him if we want to we can we
[02:20:59] can we can we can we can we can
[02:21:02] topaz
[02:21:05] sely in nice nice nice not in Salo still
[02:21:09] good enough nice ratio on the fall of
[02:21:12] naon Blade beautiful beautiful beautiful
[02:21:16] beautiful fuen we're not using her I
[02:21:19] don't think but she's really good I like
[02:21:20] her but I think we can only gear two
[02:21:22] healers at once so we're using
[02:21:25] lra and
[02:21:27] wo woo a lot of HP low defense but it is
[02:21:30] what it is time waits for no one
[02:21:34] [Music]
[02:21:37] true might as well get this to eight
[02:21:39] because it doesn't cost one of these
[02:21:40] right I only have
[02:21:42] one not an event Skipper by the way
[02:21:44] might as well get this cuz it Doesn't
[02:21:45] Really cost anything effect would be
[02:21:47] nice too but fine only dropped but also
[02:21:50] gave out a free limited five star before
[02:21:53] bro dropped the dilute
[02:21:56] guant talk to me in that tone of voice
[02:21:58] one more time and see what
[02:22:01] happens that's all I'm going to
[02:22:04] say I'm going to give my tun meshing
[02:22:07] Cox but I [ __ ] hate meshing Co like I
[02:22:10] love it's a good lonee but I just I it
[02:22:12] just makes me
[02:22:16] feel
[02:22:20] I want to level the new character
[02:22:22] though you
[02:22:25] but me I'll just do
[02:22:29] this this is like a decent amount of
[02:22:35] stats
[02:22:36] what we're missing are you okay okay
[02:22:41] yeah yeah we're going to Embers exchange
[02:22:44] yes sir yep you already know we just
[02:22:45] need one we literally need one we need
[02:22:47] one they're [ __ ] sold
[02:22:51] out I wish you were Merry
[02:22:55] Christmas I wish you a merry Christmas I
[02:23:00] wish you a
[02:23:02] merry and I
[02:23:07] have you can count on me to give it my
[02:23:10] all thanks to
[02:23:13] you um I could also just do like
[02:23:17] carve the moon weave the
[02:23:20] clouds but then we probably won't get
[02:23:22] our alt in
[02:23:24] time um relics we're on
[02:23:29] vwac yeah that's
[02:23:31] fine that's
[02:23:33] fine that's
[02:23:37] fine okay I think everyone's geared well
[02:23:40] not J sorry uh paila isn't but I don't
[02:23:43] know if I'm playing pail I really like
[02:23:44] pail I think she's great sometimes
[02:23:46] better than silverwolf in AOE but um I
[02:23:48] mean I guess we might as well give her
[02:23:49] cuz she doesn't really need anything
[02:23:51] other than just a ball and a rope so we
[02:23:54] might as well give her a ball and a rope
[02:23:56] but the problem is I only have so many
[02:23:57] balls and ropes
[02:24:02] um do I have a spare ER r one let's see
[02:24:05] main stat e r boom do I have a spare one
[02:24:09] I have one on [ __ ] why is it
[02:24:12] on
[02:24:14] oh okay then I'll just go a broken Kil
[02:24:18] ball do I have one no I don't we're
[02:24:22] going to level
[02:24:27] it okay those are definitely sub
[02:24:32] stats I can't level it past plus
[02:24:36] 12 I'm going to
[02:24:38] scream it's fine I have a piece I can
[02:24:41] throw where is
[02:24:44] it
[02:24:45] um
[02:24:48] I
[02:24:49] don't wait actually am I ever going to
[02:24:51] use this chat be honest chat be honest
[02:24:53] will I ever use this piece be honest
[02:24:55] chat chat chat be honest chat be honest
[02:24:57] will I ever use this
[02:24:59] piece no
[02:25:03] right there's no way okay that's plus 15
[02:25:06] I mean [ __ ] can I throw a five star
[02:25:08] would you be mad at me oh my God you're
[02:25:09] going to be mad at
[02:25:12] me I'm the bad guy duh sorry we're going
[02:25:16] to throw this no that's a speed boot
[02:25:17] we're going to keep the speed boot I'm
[02:25:18] going to throw one of these ice no
[02:25:20] that's good physical not bad honestly if
[02:25:23] I get
[02:25:25] lucky [ __ ] this piece I don't need it oh
[02:25:27] my God it's not even
[02:25:29] enough [ __ ] it whatever minus
[02:25:32] one bro
[02:25:40] in don't talk to me do not talk to me
[02:25:43] right now the okay the main issue here
[02:25:45] is I can only run before the tutorial
[02:25:47] Mission starts on one character I don't
[02:25:49] have two and I don't know if I'm playing
[02:25:50] Pila or silver wolf that is the only
[02:25:52] problem that is the only problem is that
[02:25:55] I can only have one of that lone that's
[02:25:57] the only problem now what I think I'm
[02:25:58] going to do to circumvent this that's a
[02:26:00] new word write it down is run a hit raid
[02:26:01] body on silver wolf just to be fine even
[02:26:04] if I'm not running the lyone does that
[02:26:05] make sense does that make sense press
[02:26:07] 129 4496 if that makes sense uh outside
[02:26:11] of that I think we're geared I think
[02:26:13] we're geared outside of
[02:26:15] that
[02:26:23] my phone just rang after he said that
[02:26:24] number that is not a phone number that I
[02:26:27] did not just say someone's phone number
[02:26:28] it
[02:26:43] isn't
[02:26:45] okay
[02:26:47] um is it that time it might be that
[02:27:07] time question
[02:27:15] mark
[02:27:21] you don't have the vent Lon I
[02:27:23] do I don't have all the superimpositions
[02:27:25] though of the new one you mean like the
[02:27:27] last event I do have
[02:27:35] it dude this L cone is
[02:27:38] like so
[02:27:45] good
[02:27:47] H okay on who her but yeah me memories
[02:27:51] of the past is like so sick too I feel
[02:27:54] like I feel like because memory of the
[02:27:56] past exists and technically meshing cogs
[02:27:59] if you're if you don't have S5 which I
[02:28:01] don't but don't talk to me then I feel
[02:28:03] like uh E1 is just better like because
[02:28:05] of that E1 is a better investment it's
[02:28:08] bait I don't think it's bait the energy
[02:28:10] to three turn alt is really nice but
[02:28:13] like um you can also just say [ __ ] it
[02:28:16] and then you'll have a four turn alt and
[02:28:17] then get all of that and also um I feel
[02:28:20] like you could
[02:28:22] just also go err and then run like
[02:28:26] quo but I don't know I don't think it's
[02:28:30] like
[02:28:34] uh three turn witho yeah it should be
[02:28:38] cuz she gives you a pretty big flat
[02:28:39] energy buff right what's the exact
[02:28:43] number the exact number yeah uh almost
[02:28:46] 20 well it should be 20% of level 10
[02:28:48] right yeah that's what it is 20% of
[02:28:49] their energy of their max energy which
[02:28:50] is like a
[02:28:53] lot so
[02:28:56] yeah okay let's talk about I'm going to
[02:28:59] talk about Ho Ho's build really fast
[02:29:00] sorry [ __ ] I'm going to talk about Ron
[02:29:03] May's build really fast so answer
[02:29:05] everyone's questions and then we're
[02:29:06] going to play and clear everything okay
[02:29:08] okay agree agree let me let me
[02:29:10] caffeinate first cuz I'm tired I don't
[02:29:12] know why I'm
[02:29:15] tired now what I'm going to do is invent
[02:29:17] a fictional chatter hey Z could you
[02:29:20] explain to me how to build Ron May and
[02:29:22] the different options she has oh good
[02:29:24] question real chatter let me answer that
[02:29:27] question for you and explain
[02:29:32] it okay so there's actually um ROM is
[02:29:37] like okay her kid is insane so you kind
[02:29:39] of can't go wrong but tldr here's what
[02:29:41] you need to know she gives you a ton of
[02:29:43] Buffs you get a [ __ ] ton of speed you
[02:29:45] get bre weakness bre break efficiency
[02:29:48] from her I should probably talk about
[02:29:49] one ability at a time actually I don't
[02:29:50] need to talk about every ability but
[02:29:52] skill gives you weakness break
[02:29:53] efficiency and damage but the weakness
[02:29:54] break efficiency is so nice because it's
[02:29:56] not break effect it's not break effect
[02:29:57] it's not damage from your break it's
[02:29:59] [ __ ] efficiency which means you break
[02:30:01] Shields faster which is insane you also
[02:30:03] get more
[02:30:04] damage uh 30% I think it's 32 at level
[02:30:06] 10 or is it 30 no 30 wait what is that
[02:30:08] level 10 I can only see level 9 [ __ ] is
[02:30:11] level
[02:30:15] 10 I am not telling you the website I'm
[02:30:17] going on right now don't talk to
[02:30:19] me it's probably plus two it is okay
[02:30:22] it's 32 yeah 32 cuz I it's I know you
[02:30:26] could just assume it's plus two but like
[02:30:28] sometimes it's more at the last level I
[02:30:29] think jinglu is an example I don't
[02:30:31] remember anyways [ __ ] ton of damage a
[02:30:33] ton of damage from your skill a ton of
[02:30:34] weakness break efficiency you also get
[02:30:36] speed per Perma buff by the way just
[02:30:39] always speed to every character that's
[02:30:40] not her and she also deals break damage
[02:30:44] whenever a weakness is broken like on
[02:30:46] top of it kind of like separately like
[02:30:48] if your ally breaks a shield you also do
[02:30:52] her break damage which is like the Ice
[02:30:53] Break damage which is high because
[02:30:55] you're usually building Brak effect on
[02:30:56] her why are you building break effect
[02:30:57] because this Talent is broken this is
[02:30:59] like the best lowkey maybe not the best
[02:31:01] part of her kit but low key the best
[02:31:02] part of a kit you just randomly give
[02:31:04] your whole team 36%
[02:31:06] damage um well up to 36% it's more
[02:31:10] damage scaling on how much break effect
[02:31:11] you have capping at
[02:31:14] 180 is that the math I'm going to assume
[02:31:17] that's the math yes so capping at 180
[02:31:19] break effect you give 36 damage to your
[02:31:21] whole team on top of another best part
[02:31:24] of her kit probably better than the last
[02:31:25] one cuz I'm yapping is the res pen so
[02:31:27] you literally ignore um well not ignore
[02:31:30] but well yeah but that's not the word I
[02:31:33] should use but anyways you increase your
[02:31:35] res pen to every [ __ ] type by a lot
[02:31:38] uh again scaling up with your level
[02:31:39] which is
[02:31:40] huge and break
[02:31:44] damage well the break damage doesn't
[02:31:46] matter well actually what matters is the
[02:31:48] the delaying action but I wanted to talk
[02:31:50] about that later but I guess I'll talk
[02:31:51] about that now you also delay the action
[02:31:53] of the enemies more than a normal break
[02:31:55] because scaling on your [ __ ] break uh
[02:31:59] effect what is res pen okay and the
[02:32:02] easiest way I can explain this without
[02:32:05] making it confusing is enemies have
[02:32:07] resistances that'll make your damage
[02:32:09] lower like let's say you do like 100
[02:32:12] damage or 100K and then you on an enemy
[02:32:14] with no resistances if the enemy has
[02:32:15] like 30% resistance you'll do a lot less
[02:32:18] damage it's not exactly one it's not
[02:32:20] exactly 30% less but cuz there's a bunch
[02:32:22] of multipliers but basically you just
[02:32:23] ignore some defense well no that's
[02:32:25] defense reduction you ignore resistances
[02:32:27] so it's like
[02:32:30] yeah there's there's res shred and
[02:32:33] there's defense shred and they're both
[02:32:34] they also stack with each other and
[02:32:36] together they the more you have of one
[02:32:38] or either the better it is tldr is just
[02:32:40] way more damage to everything always
[02:32:43] basically that's basically what this
[02:32:45] means
[02:32:48] um yeah so that's cracked you also get
[02:32:52] some energy you also get some uh uh
[02:32:54] break effect to her and her whole team
[02:32:56] and she also has traces that give her
[02:32:57] break effect to where you get a free
[02:33:01] 53.7 is that the number no 57.3 I am
[02:33:06] unable to read numbers they switch
[02:33:08] around 57.3 break effect for
[02:33:11] free on your uh runme which means you
[02:33:15] don't need that much because well okay
[02:33:18] you still need a lot but let me explain
[02:33:20] you you want at least I don't have
[02:33:22] enough right now um so let's not talk
[02:33:24] about it but you want at least 180 break
[02:33:28] effect but actually why don't I have
[02:33:30] enough right now am I on the wrong
[02:33:32] something wait let me put her um
[02:33:36] wait oh wait cuz it's not in battle
[02:33:39] right yeah we're not in battle that's
[02:33:40] why okay never mind uh so um yeah if I
[02:33:45] check in battle it should should be
[02:33:46] enough so you want at least 180 break
[02:33:49] effect when you factor in all of this
[02:33:51] stuff including this 21 which is the
[02:33:53] only thing you get in battle I think
[02:33:55] yeah so it' be plus 20 in battle which
[02:33:56] means I would have 184 yeah so you want
[02:34:00] 180 break effect but it's actually a lot
[02:34:02] lower than that because you get 57 point
[02:34:04] fre uh for free and 20% of it doesn't
[02:34:07] show there and you also can run a light
[02:34:09] cone that gives you break effect like
[02:34:10] memories of the past or her
[02:34:13] signature which means that your build's
[02:34:15] pretty [ __ ] easy cuz all you want is one
[02:34:18] break effect till you have at least 180
[02:34:20] pass is okay like it's not bad to have
[02:34:21] more it just won't buff your team it'll
[02:34:23] just give you more break damage which is
[02:34:24] okay um and it'll delay their action
[02:34:27] longer I think there's no cap on that
[02:34:29] right let me check is there a cap on
[02:34:33] that
[02:34:37] uh yeah there's no cap what element is
[02:34:40] she
[02:34:44] ice and anyways so that's that which
[02:34:47] means that for your stats you're
[02:34:48] typically looking for break effect at
[02:34:50] least 180 that's like your goal and
[02:34:53] speed speed helps the more speed for the
[02:34:55] most part the better like if you're
[02:34:56] super fast and your team your DPS is
[02:34:58] like super slow your alt might not have
[02:35:00] up time technically cuz the Alton skill
[02:35:02] they tick down you they they last for a
[02:35:05] set amount of her turns not your whole
[02:35:07] party's turns CU as you can see every
[02:35:09] time her turn starts the duration goes
[02:35:10] down by one but for the most part it's
[02:35:12] fine you just like speed is good and
[02:35:14] then you can look for tanky stats which
[02:35:15] means stat wise you're typically going
[02:35:17] AGP defense on the body AGP or defense
[02:35:19] on the ball and then speed boots and
[02:35:22] then rope is either err or break effect
[02:35:24] I like err I'm an err fan and you can
[02:35:27] usually do a three- turn ultimate if
[02:35:29] you're running her uh with either a
[02:35:32] lyone that gives you energy which we'll
[02:35:33] talk about or a set that gives you
[02:35:35] energy like panak or vwac well not or
[02:35:38] you need both um but I say or because
[02:35:41] you could usually replace like penak for
[02:35:43] example with a support that gives you
[02:35:45] energy for example
[02:35:47] uh but if you're like if you know you're
[02:35:48] going to do a four turn alt or you're
[02:35:50] not running that or you're running like
[02:35:51] her signature like like there's
[02:35:53] situations where you could go a break
[02:35:54] effect rope too if you don't need the
[02:35:56] energy but I like energy especially in
[02:35:57] Long fights um and break effect is
[02:36:01] something you can get on substats but
[02:36:03] you can't get energy regen on substats
[02:36:06] which is why I value it a lot but if you
[02:36:07] know that you don't need the extra
[02:36:08] energy then you don't need to um for
[02:36:12] your sets it kind of doesn't matter
[02:36:14] that's not true it matters but like
[02:36:15] there's no good for there's no like
[02:36:17] amazing four piece for her so typically
[02:36:18] you do two-piece meteor for break effect
[02:36:20] and two-piece speed uh messenger for
[02:36:23] Speed but you could do other things you
[02:36:25] could do for thief of shooting meteor if
[02:36:27] you have uh for another 16% break but
[02:36:30] then the energy gen part is kind of
[02:36:31] random not random but inconsistent cuz
[02:36:33] you need to break enemies to get
[02:36:35] energy Z Jeff why are you spamming me
[02:36:37] the one time I'm recording something I
[02:36:39] don't care about Yap it's a [ __ ] emote
[02:36:41] [ __ ] you sorry not [ __ ] you but it's a
[02:36:44] [ __ ] emote
[02:36:46] anyways um for's messenger is decent too
[02:36:50] but I don't know it's only one turn and
[02:36:53] it's kind of weird but like it's fine it
[02:36:55] works with her alt but it's only a one
[02:36:56] turn speed buff it's fine
[02:37:00] um but yeah I think those are like the
[02:37:02] main options like I guess you could go
[02:37:04] other two pieces but for the most part
[02:37:05] it's like break effect or speed or
[02:37:07] messenger uh is kind of what people are
[02:37:09] going go on sub stats too that matters
[02:37:11] uh and then for your two-piece uh
[02:37:14] planetary ornament Force speed is bait
[02:37:17] yeah I don't think Force speed is
[02:37:18] amazing especially on her but like it's
[02:37:21] fine get speed it's
[02:37:23] okay I don't think it's like a I don't
[02:37:25] think it's going to hurt
[02:37:27] you wind set
[02:37:37] on but yeah I mean I I usually go I
[02:37:40] usually I think most people are going to
[02:37:41] go two break two speed it's pretty like
[02:37:43] easy cuz you can mix and match and and
[02:37:44] this set you get just from bosses
[02:37:47] anyways um um um um um um for the
[02:37:50] planetory ornaments penacon is usually
[02:37:53] really nice cuz you get energy regen and
[02:37:55] then you also buff characters of the
[02:37:56] other of the same type the 5% energy
[02:37:58] regen is the main thing because that can
[02:38:00] help you get a three- turn alt but you
[02:38:02] might not need it especially if you're
[02:38:03] running like H or if you don't care
[02:38:05] about it like maybe you're going for a
[02:38:06] four turn alt there's other two pieces
[02:38:08] that are good too vona can also give you
[02:38:10] the energy I'm a vwac hater but I use it
[02:38:13] on Ting Yun you can use it it also gives
[02:38:14] you 5% energy it's just the other part
[02:38:16] of it uh won't be as good as panaki if
[02:38:18] you're running another ice type like
[02:38:20] Jing Liu which is when you would use
[02:38:21] panone all but Von can work too okay I
[02:38:24] didn't want to like [ __ ] talk it you can
[02:38:25] also use a generic buffing set like
[02:38:27] broken Keel for crit damage but the
[02:38:28] problem with broken Kel or broken kill
[02:38:30] or Fleet of the Ageless the only problem
[02:38:31] with both of them is that again it'll be
[02:38:33] harder to get your alt up uh without the
[02:38:36] energy Von Rock's insane it is but like
[02:38:40] I don't know I just I don't like
[02:38:42] thinking about vwac cuz it's like the
[02:38:44] world is so stupid to Farm like you
[02:38:46] don't want I don't know it's I just yeah
[02:38:48] it it's
[02:38:50] fine anyways usually it's it's pentacon
[02:38:53] or bwac for energy if not you go broken
[02:38:55] kill or ageless buff your team you can
[02:38:58] also uh if you want another set that's
[02:39:01] fine if you have enough speed no not
[02:39:02] speed sorry uh what it is where the [ __ ]
[02:39:04] is it I literally might not even have it
[02:39:06] by the
[02:39:08] way it is speed but I don't know where
[02:39:10] it
[02:39:10] is I literally don't have it I don't
[02:39:13] even have the [ __ ] break set
[02:39:16] that's how
[02:39:18] disgusting where the [ __ ] is it Data
[02:39:24] Bank come
[02:39:26] Bank
[02:39:29] relics there it is
[02:39:31] Talia yes also if you have 145 speed or
[02:39:35] higher you can get a bunch of break
[02:39:36] effect 16% and then you also increase
[02:39:38] your Brak effect by another 20% 16 20
[02:39:41] that's a lot however one you need a lot
[02:39:44] of speed but 145 is manage like you
[02:39:45] should should have 145 uh if you go
[02:39:47] speed boots and good sub stats but the
[02:39:49] main thing is if you do this you lose
[02:39:50] out on either a team wide buff or some
[02:39:55] um energy if you don't need the energy
[02:39:58] then this is fine like this is pretty
[02:40:00] this is a lot of sub stats basically so
[02:40:02] if you can't get enough break effect on
[02:40:03] your subs or if you just don't need the
[02:40:05] energy then this is pretty good
[02:40:07] op
[02:40:09] wow yeah if your subat suck yeah that's
[02:40:11] kind of the same with the Rope whereas
[02:40:14] you change it if your subat is not as
[02:40:15] good
[02:40:16] anyways lyones are pretty easy you kind
[02:40:19] of know
[02:40:20] [Music]
[02:40:23] brainer I really don't want her that
[02:40:25] fast yeah but I kind of hate this cuz I
[02:40:27] feel like if there's no good sub stats
[02:40:28] for you you kind of like you start
[02:40:30] leaning towards speed but if she's
[02:40:33] really okay if she's really fast and all
[02:40:35] of your DPS or your main DPS character
[02:40:37] is slow then you're going to lose your
[02:40:39] Buffs before your DPS keeps going but
[02:40:41] you can also have a fast BR and then a
[02:40:43] like you can like make your DPS es go a
[02:40:45] bunch of
[02:40:47] times can we fast because skill point
[02:40:49] regeneration yeah but also gen
[02:40:53] generation not regeneration but also you
[02:40:55] your alt only you you won't generate
[02:40:57] your alt that fast
[02:40:58] though um if you don't
[02:41:01] have I mean but you might
[02:41:04] have you might have poo and you might
[02:41:06] have the [ __ ] L cone and then if you
[02:41:08] attack
[02:41:13] more okay I don't want to talk about
[02:41:14] speed tuning right now tldr usually goes
[02:41:17] speed but if your DPSS are really low
[02:41:18] slow and you are way too fast on her
[02:41:20] then you can stop going speed and then
[02:41:22] go break effect and tankiness that's
[02:41:25] it but like like if your DPS is like 99
[02:41:28] speed or like low hundreds and she's
[02:41:32] super [ __ ] fast you might not have
[02:41:35] the up time on your ult
[02:41:37] anymore actually no that's not even true
[02:41:39] cuz you can Auto attack on her three
[02:41:41] times and you should have the wait no
[02:41:42] you should be fine
[02:41:44] right
[02:41:47] wait would you be fine cuz if you can
[02:41:50] three turn alt on her then your buff
[02:41:52] will oh no wait no you it won't be fine
[02:41:55] actually X
[02:42:09] FL so the okay the skill buff is three
[02:42:14] turns
[02:42:17] which is
[02:42:24] fine your alt is
[02:42:41] only I feel like I'm missing a
[02:42:44] Trace
[02:42:46] cuz I know you can make it three like I
[02:42:48] know that but it says two there which
[02:42:50] one is it am I bad at reading last for
[02:42:52] three turns three decreases by
[02:42:54] one
[02:42:59] uh
[02:43:07] [Music]
[02:43:10] technique bro this [ __ ] is an
[02:43:14] essay
[02:43:15] [Music]
[02:43:29] oh
[02:43:30] this no but that's
[02:43:37] [Music]
[02:43:44] skill
[02:43:47] she's like
[02:43:50] Foo wait so it is only
[02:44:06] two eidolons is that what it is I know
[02:44:09] what this one does I know what this one
[02:44:11] does so it has to be a later
[02:44:13] one oh that that's why okay that's
[02:44:20] why okay that changes things a
[02:44:23] little why is it
[02:44:31] E6 the pass got yeah this likeone yeah
[02:44:35] you need to got it
[02:44:41] [Music]
[02:44:44] sag
[02:44:46] it changes everything no
[02:44:50] weighing damn
[02:45:00] okay yeah cuz if you get your alt every
[02:45:02] three
[02:45:04] turns that means that even if you're
[02:45:06] like even if you're
[02:45:08] fully like fine on skill points if
[02:45:11] you're going way too often you're going
[02:45:13] to lose out on uh your alt buff because
[02:45:17] you won't be able to even if you went
[02:45:19] twice then your DPSS are going to go or
[02:45:21] your one DPS is going to go and you
[02:45:22] won't have your alt buff and your Al
[02:45:24] buff is pretty big you'll have your
[02:45:26] skill
[02:45:27] buff like this one and this
[02:45:30] one and this but you want to have your
[02:45:33] Al
[02:45:40] buff but you could just
[02:45:43] go I mean what if you have a fast
[02:45:51] brna like if your br's faster than your
[02:45:55] no but your DPS would probably want to
[02:45:57] be fast
[02:46:07] too the alt so the the the alt expires
[02:46:12] only at her turn like her turn makes it
[02:46:13] lose a duration it's not like a cycle
[02:46:16] it's whenever it's her
[02:46:17] [Music]
[02:46:24] turn
[02:46:26] yeah so you'd probably want your team to
[02:46:28] be fast
[02:46:31] realistically I'm just going to build
[02:46:33] full speed the name's not difficult
[02:46:35] enough for all this yeah but and you
[02:46:37] also yeah you also give your team speed
[02:46:39] with this and your other supports might
[02:46:41] probably will give you speed through
[02:46:43] whatever passive or set or whatever the
[02:46:45] [ __ ] or br
[02:46:48] br not too complicated yeah I know but
[02:46:51] I'm wondering if there's
[02:46:55] a if there's I don't
[02:46:58] know cuz the the problem is like okay
[02:47:01] you don't want her to be way faster than
[02:47:02] everyone that's the only thing but the
[02:47:04] thing is you might be able to do that if
[02:47:05] you're running a break effect like cone
[02:47:07] you have nothing else to build but it's
[02:47:08] like at that point you could go
[02:47:09] defensive stats so I guess that's the
[02:47:11] answer it's just that characters that
[02:47:13] don't need other like as many other
[02:47:17] stats end up being faster just cuz
[02:47:18] you're getting speed because you're not
[02:47:20] looking for that much [ __ ] but
[02:47:27] yeah I need my my
[02:47:32] [Music]
[02:47:34] um okay fair
[02:47:38] enough I have I have made up my mind
[02:47:41] then speed wise it'll just be you want
[02:47:44] speed on her speed is great but you
[02:47:46] don't want
[02:47:47] to yeah you don't want to be way faster
[02:47:49] than your whole team you want to be the
[02:47:49] fastest cuz then your Al's going to
[02:47:51] expire and your Buffs are going to
[02:47:52] expire you can still manage your skill
[02:47:54] but your alt's going to expire because
[02:47:55] it's only two turns and you usually get
[02:47:56] your alt every three but if you're it
[02:47:59] scales it ticks down on your turn not
[02:48:01] your whole team's turn so you don't want
[02:48:03] that like speed is good and you want to
[02:48:04] build speed but if you have way more
[02:48:06] speed than everyone everyone else is
[02:48:07] slow on your team and you don't have
[02:48:08] like speed buffers and Bron and [ __ ]
[02:48:09] like that then it's going to hurt you
[02:48:11] but you also don't want her to be slow
[02:48:13] cuz then it's like you're never going
[02:48:14] your [ __ ] I mean overall is just
[02:48:17] disgusting right less turns less not
[02:48:19] less Buffs but take you longer to set up
[02:48:21] your Buffs and to get your energy and
[02:48:23] all that so that's probably what it
[02:48:27] is but I don't want to get into the
[02:48:28] exact numbers because it's like speed
[02:48:30] tuning is annoying speed traces yeah but
[02:48:32] speed traces are just speed traces like
[02:48:33] she just gets speed but actually this is
[02:48:36] not she does give your team speed which
[02:48:38] is good like a free 10% speed is
[02:48:43] nice
[02:48:50] yeah oh cage
[02:48:56] business okay I think that's I think
[02:48:58] we're done gearing
[02:49:10] um do you want her you probably yeah
[02:49:14] wait so I would need her to be it would
[02:49:16] have to be Ron
[02:49:22] may wait what am I putting my bronia at
[02:49:24] though am I making my bronia like 161 or
[02:49:27] am I making her just a bit like right
[02:49:29] after my
[02:49:33] [Music]
[02:49:43] DPS
[02:49:45] F use a skill stack from your Technique
[02:49:47] yeah but technique is only one turn
[02:49:49] right like it's only like the start of
[02:49:50] the fight your Al off before your D's
[02:49:53] third turn after Ron
[02:49:56] mailed
[02:50:04] [Music]
[02:50:08] yeah are you still gearing cuz I'm
[02:50:11] figuring out my speed tuning before I
[02:50:12] send it and before I tell people things
[02:50:20] wait let me pull up the I have a spread
[02:50:22] sheet actually of her Cycles not her
[02:50:26] Cycles her team's
[02:50:36] [Music]
[02:50:43] rotation why you doing that just spread
[02:50:45] misinformation
[02:50:47] true
[02:51:02] [Music]
[02:51:13] true
[02:51:34] yeah okay I don't know if looking at I
[02:51:36] don't know if anything past this matters
[02:51:39] but I am
[02:51:43] curious
[02:51:48] cuz Okay usually you're doing DPS like
[02:51:50] okay usually
[02:51:52] it's rme is going to be a bit faster and
[02:51:55] then it's going to be unless your br's
[02:51:57] like 161 well it's not always 161 but
[02:52:00] unless your BR is
[02:52:06] faster cuz this
[02:52:09] also yeah usually it doesn't yeah
[02:52:11] usually for most PS it's going to be DPS
[02:52:13] and then BR and then you go again on
[02:52:14] your DPS or you're not running BR or
[02:52:16] your BR is overlapping but if your BR is
[02:52:19] not
[02:52:23] going
[02:52:25] um yeah no it'll be
[02:52:28] fine okay I think I think that'll be
[02:52:37] fine Auto yeah yeah that's I mean you
[02:52:39] could just Auto and then
[02:52:43] skill
[02:52:44] [Music]
[02:52:49] which we're going to have to do cuz my
[02:52:50] BR is on one [ __ ] 54
[02:52:57] speed and our embor is
[02:53:02] [Music]
[02:53:07] 133 you're going to Auto Battle anyways
[02:53:10] dude I'm not going to Auto
[02:53:13] Battle
[02:53:30] 134 speed the Shang Ling yes but it's
[02:53:33] only for zero
[02:53:35] cycle can you do that
[02:53:39] maybe wait what happens okay wait this
[02:53:42] is the only thing I'm not sure of what
[02:53:43] happens if you're your Ron May is like
[02:53:46] 200 speed like and your other characters
[02:53:48] are like 90 like what happens if you're
[02:53:50] like turbo [ __ ] fast and you're like
[02:53:53] literally going way
[02:53:58] more do you actually end up losing up
[02:54:07] time don't know don't care I know most
[02:54:09] people don't but I'm trying to see cuz I
[02:54:11] don't want to recommend more speed than
[02:54:13] you need it if I if I if that's
[02:54:19] wrong have to spend more skills yeah but
[02:54:22] a lot of teams are still skill point
[02:54:23] efficient not all of them like you might
[02:54:25] be playing like well I mean
[02:54:28] even I mean if your inv vior is slow he
[02:54:30] shouldn't be but if he
[02:54:41] is cuz your Al a two turn B
[02:54:47] buff okay this is getting into Fields
[02:54:49] crafting territory I'll figure it out
[02:54:50] after the stream then so than 4
[02:54:53] months I'll figure it out after the
[02:54:55] stream how good would you say zo
[02:55:11] is okay yeah we'll just send it
[02:55:24] [Music]
[02:55:26] isn't it all feels crafting no I mean
[02:55:29] most of it is CED but the speed stuff
[02:55:31] I'm less competent
[02:55:34] in like like cones and like energy how
[02:55:36] many energy you get per turn that's all
[02:55:38] stuff you Cal pretty easily but the
[02:55:40] speed tuning I'm pretty not well versed
[02:55:42] in cuz like I know the break points but
[02:55:44] like who cares about the break points
[02:55:45] past like a lot of that [ __ ] gets thrown
[02:55:48] out the window if either you're not
[02:55:49] going for specific amount of Cycles or
[02:55:51] if you're playing characters that change
[02:55:53] that like a buffer or not a buffer but
[02:55:55] like a speed buffer or sets that give
[02:55:57] speed or hey your actions Advance
[02:56:04] forward so that's the only thing I'm
[02:56:06] unsure
[02:56:07] of anyways but I'll figure that out
[02:56:09] after but for now for the rest lyones
[02:56:13] are are are pretty oaba likeon you have
[02:56:15] literally everything uh well not
[02:56:17] everything but there's so many good
[02:56:18] options usually most people freeto
[02:56:20] playay option S5 meshing cogs energy
[02:56:23] regen rope and then a a two-piece
[02:56:25] planetary ornament that gives you energy
[02:56:27] so either uh the new one pentoney or
[02:56:30] vwac and then you get your turn every
[02:56:32] your alt every three turns but you can
[02:56:33] also run wo who gives you energy or
[02:56:35] another character that gives you energy
[02:56:36] you're not going to te you an ALT you're
[02:56:37] support but you get the point and then
[02:56:39] you need less but anyways meshing cogs
[02:56:41] S5 or memories of the past S5 give give
[02:56:44] the same amount of energy uh you could
[02:56:46] go a lower superimposition memory of the
[02:56:48] past but basically only if you have an
[02:56:50] energy buff like wo or if you get hit um
[02:56:54] because this lone is insane by the way
[02:56:56] meshing cogs only gives you energy but
[02:56:58] memories of the past gives you [ __ ]
[02:57:00] uh break effect which is amazing so a
[02:57:02] really good lyone alternative lyones
[02:57:04] include her signature which is typically
[02:57:06] best in slot but sometimes not that
[02:57:09] we'll talk about it or uh you can do
[02:57:12] planetary Ru to buff characters of the
[02:57:13] same type although I don't really
[02:57:14] recommend that over energy but it's a
[02:57:16] good option especially with super
[02:57:18] positions same with uh dance dance dance
[02:57:22] but usually I like the energy lies or
[02:57:24] the signature whoa what is the signature
[02:57:27] whoa it's just a lot of stats that's it
[02:57:29] it literally it's actually funny it
[02:57:31] literally gives you so much damage it's
[02:57:32] like another it's literally like another
[02:57:34] alt it's literally so break 60% break
[02:57:37] effect which is cool and then you get
[02:57:38] 24% damage to all your party for 20 uh
[02:57:42] for for three turns after you Al which
[02:57:43] is
[02:57:45] good up time unless you're alting every
[02:57:46] four turns but even then you're probably
[02:57:49] finishing the combat by then um or maybe
[02:57:52] like after I guess two times this uh and
[02:57:55] then on top of that you also get skill
[02:57:56] points and energy at the sort of every
[02:57:57] wave sort of every wave is not nice cuz
[02:57:59] usually it's like two waves but still a
[02:58:02] bit of energy not as much but a little
[02:58:04] bit um but generally like break effect
[02:58:07] skill points and a ton of damage to all
[02:58:09] your allies pretty good uh like really
[02:58:11] good veryy a ton of stats but you get
[02:58:14] less energy so you're either going to
[02:58:15] have to do a bunch of uh like you're
[02:58:18] going to have to do a bunch of stuff to
[02:58:19] get your still get a three- turn alt
[02:58:21] like wo energy rope two-piece vwac or uh
[02:58:26] peny and then at that point do you still
[02:58:28] get it I have it written I have a energy
[02:58:30] caler let me read it give me a second
[02:58:34] um
[02:58:36] signature no you need to get two waves
[02:58:40] right no that's not true that's without
[02:58:42] hoo without hoo you need two waves of
[02:58:45] enemies no one wave wait one
[02:58:57] sec yeah you should be fine with poo but
[02:59:00] anyways with this you either go four
[02:59:01] four Cycles uh four turn alt and you
[02:59:03] don't care or you try to get a three
[02:59:04] turn if you have a energy
[02:59:07] buffer but yeah I mean it's pretty easy
[02:59:09] like there's the freetop playay L cone
[02:59:11] like meshing cogs or even um yeah you
[02:59:14] can also get hit that's fair like
[02:59:15] getting hit is random though you don't
[02:59:16] want to depend on that but if you get
[02:59:17] hit twice yeah but it also depends like
[02:59:20] the wave thing is also once per combat
[02:59:23] or like twice if it's two waves but it's
[02:59:24] like you're not through a long fight
[02:59:25] it's not going to keep going
[02:59:28] um but yeah that's basically
[02:59:35] it dud here hello dud
[02:59:40] balls and I think E1 is okay Lyon is
[02:59:44] good but there's other really good
[02:59:45] options like especially this one
[02:59:46] although it's gacha but even even
[02:59:48] meshing cogs for energy uh and because
[02:59:51] of that I really like E1 if you're
[02:59:52] asking which one's better I think both
[02:59:54] are good but the ly cone because there's
[02:59:56] really good Alternatives that give you
[02:59:58] energy and the one like especially the
[03:00:00] memories of the past that gives you
[03:00:03] break effect and energy especially if
[03:00:04] you superimpose it or have huo to be
[03:00:07] like whatever energy you're missing or
[03:00:09] whatever uh E1 is insane like 20%
[03:00:11] defense ignore um
[03:00:14] yeah when you Al 20% defens insane
[03:00:18] really really good that's like cuz it's
[03:00:20] not just damage percent that getting
[03:00:21] more and more and more damage percent
[03:00:22] you'll lose a lot of value defense shred
[03:00:25] is like it's so good like well it's not
[03:00:27] defense shred well technically it's not
[03:00:29] reducing defense it's ignoring defense
[03:00:31] but yeah 20% defense ignore is
[03:00:34] huge I think I can use the words
[03:00:36] interchangeably but anyways okay I want
[03:00:38] to play the game now
[03:00:41] sorry yapping
[03:00:51] yapping okay 10 11 12 2hour intro yeah
[03:00:55] but I want to like I wanted to figure
[03:00:57] out the speed things cuz I don't want to
[03:00:58] not be able to answer people's questions
[03:01:00] like I don't want to feel like I don't
[03:01:01] know so I need to make sure I do know
[03:01:03] but it's like I don't know some
[03:01:05] sometimes it's like I feel like it gets
[03:01:08] really weird speed wise cuz like some
[03:01:09] people like what if your blade is like
[03:01:11] literally one speed it's like why and
[03:01:13] then your [ __ ] Ron Ma on like 7
[03:01:15] million but just don't do
[03:01:18] that okay we're
[03:01:23] ready he will forget in one day dude I
[03:01:28] don't forget you think I'm forgetful be
[03:01:34] honest blade can't have one speed okay
[03:01:38] explain this then we have four bonus
[03:01:41] speed on our blade we have like one one
[03:01:43] sub stat two probably two two sub
[03:01:48] stats no it's one
[03:01:52] four our blade has yo yeah we don't talk
[03:01:56] about our
[03:01:58] blade
[03:02:03] anyways ratio
[03:02:08] zag
[03:02:09] anyways gaming time gaming
[03:02:15] no our blades cracked it's just low
[03:02:17] speed that's all which isn't ideal but
[03:02:20] whatever uh I don't have good speed
[03:02:22] boots so it is what it
[03:02:29] is wa let me do let me do something
[03:02:31] really fast we're going to do I'm going
[03:02:32] to do
[03:02:33] blade I'm going to do
[03:02:37] bronia and I'm going to
[03:02:42] do run May whoo
[03:02:46] whoo I could put a full team on the
[03:02:49] second half maybe I
[03:02:50] will but I just want to test
[03:02:55] something I don't think I'll actually do
[03:02:56] the second half I just want to test
[03:02:57] something I want to see if this
[03:03:00] works you're breaking nothing [ __ ] you
[03:03:04] this isn't uh we're not trying to clear
[03:03:05] I just want to see if this works show
[03:03:07] your C Sound I mean we're we're probably
[03:03:10] going to clear even though we have no
[03:03:12] break but uh I just want to
[03:03:19] see I can't do this forward get
[03:03:31] them enjoying
[03:03:34] yourself every pedal in light all will
[03:03:36] be swept away by the
[03:03:42] wind
[03:03:50] your end
[03:03:51] approaches yeah cuz our blade goes like
[03:03:53] our Bron is going to go before our blade
[03:03:55] well went before our blade but we autoed
[03:03:57] instead of eing and now we go and then
[03:03:59] we e our blade and then it's blades turn
[03:04:02] we've entered the storm to guard and
[03:04:04] defend crush them that paradise May
[03:04:08] savor it for
[03:04:10] me and that and then this
[03:04:14] and then blade go I mean bronia goes
[03:04:15] again but we can just normal again right
[03:04:18] should I heal should I use my skill why
[03:04:20] am I not using my skill
[03:04:24] go your Devils I'll crush them all uh
[03:04:29] I'm going to reuse this as well ah yeah
[03:04:32] we have so many skill
[03:04:35] points we let him cook I'm just looking
[03:04:37] at speed and energy right now I'm not
[03:04:38] trying to like I think we're going to
[03:04:40] clear like by accident almost but I'm
[03:04:42] just making sure this still works
[03:04:54] every pedal and all will be swept away
[03:04:56] by the
[03:04:58] wind and our blade goes again so that's
[03:05:01] good a blade
[03:05:04] knows I'm going to Al cuz I don't want
[03:05:06] to waste another cycle cuz this guy's
[03:05:08] going to he wouldn't die if I
[03:05:12] don't
[03:05:14] fail to should have Bron aled first
[03:05:17] though we've entered the storm to guard
[03:05:20] and defend them too much green yeah
[03:05:24] we're like almost Mono
[03:05:27] Wind give me oh I didn't
[03:05:40] F yeah this is
[03:05:42] fine
[03:05:44] [Music]
[03:05:47] Eternal I will dispatch you the fight is
[03:05:50] set I'm going insane dude
[03:05:54] chill I'm making sure our 99 our our 104
[03:05:57] is it no 99 plus 4 103 speed no but it's
[03:06:00] not 97 base so 101 yeah 101 speed blade
[03:06:03] still works lend me your strength a
[03:06:07] blade Knows No
[03:06:10] Mercy this has been fine so far but I
[03:06:13] wonder if after a certain amount of
[03:06:14] turns it stops being fine uh should I
[03:06:17] use my skill again we have no skill
[03:06:18] points who's next Ron may she doesn't
[03:06:20] need to skill we're going to use a skill
[03:06:24] but I'd rather break this we're just
[03:06:25] going to break
[03:06:31] this grace and
[03:06:35] elegance this battle is
[03:06:42] unavoidable
[03:06:45] protect me
[03:06:49] me are devils I'll crush them all that
[03:06:54] is a lot of Al enter the storm to guard
[03:06:57] and defend crush them every pedal in all
[03:07:01] will be swept away by the
[03:07:03] wind all will be swept away by the wind
[03:07:07] that paradise made savor it for
[03:07:11] me can we do this then we go here and
[03:07:13] then Bron makes us go yet again always a
[03:07:15] we lend me your
[03:07:18] strength
[03:07:21] yeah cuz that was a lot of cycles and
[03:07:24] consistently we were fine and our our
[03:07:26] blades on like no speed and our br's on
[03:07:28] high speed caution does not mean
[03:07:32] cowardice coolest let's
[03:07:35] wait what are here
[03:07:39] CL okay we're in trouble now when you're

[03:10:29] why I'm running in B against a guy
[03:10:30] that's not imaginary weak do notat but
[03:10:33] this was I wasn't supposed to clear I
[03:10:34] was supposed to
[03:10:35] just uh just test the first team but now
[03:10:38] we're already here so we might as well
[03:10:39] clear I could implant it but it's a one
[03:10:42] and
[03:10:44] three and I don't like those
[03:10:47] odds I've got a raid to get to let's
[03:10:52] finish um minus one + one plus one no I
[03:10:57] can't even plus

[03:11:19] store you're fighting a gentl all
[03:11:29] your pay for
[03:11:31] that a thousand wonders finest
[03:11:41] one you yeah our teams are not on the
[03:11:45] right half like we shouldn't be doing
[03:11:46] this what I'm doing right now but it's
[03:11:48] okay uh I need to heal everyone I'm
[03:11:50] going to e and then alt and then do a

[03:12:08] SK World cleansing
[03:12:11] dragon
[03:12:17] yeah you might get [ __ ] a little here
[03:12:19] because this isn't really the team but
[03:12:21] it's okay should probably kill this
[03:12:23] thing it's kind of too late you chose
[03:12:26] The Wrong
[03:12:31] Enemy I kind of don't want a
[03:12:37] skill I'm not going to
[03:12:40] skill inevitable
[03:12:47] search behold symb
[03:12:50] of this combat needs
[03:12:53] optimizing I don't want to waste my ALT
[03:12:55] here but it dies before it goes the
[03:12:57] damage buff does the damage buff expire
[03:12:59] when it dies I don't think so
[03:13:00] right no it doesn't so I could Al it to
[03:13:03] remove the damage buff that's probably
[03:13:05] not
[03:13:07] worth
[03:13:11] uh
[03:13:24] oops yeah this team call might be a
[03:13:26] little doomed I don't think I kill it
[03:13:28] this is double speed I don't think it's
[03:13:30] worth it it's one damage
[03:13:37] buff I'll see you
[03:13:39] off Let The Duel commence turn sleep the
[03:13:43] Dead
[03:13:47] return conf welcome customers yeah we
[03:13:50] also DED a buff dis spel which is pretty
[03:13:54] good
[03:13:57] thousand forgot about the awaken through
[03:14:01] World cleansing
[03:14:02] Dragon
[03:14:06] okay
[03:14:08] quick underestimated
[03:14:11] you
[03:14:16] pay put forth all your money CRA nothing
[03:14:21] major receive Divinity run May where
[03:14:23] she's on the first half I literally was
[03:14:25] just testing my first half team but we
[03:14:26] got here so we might as well keep going
[03:14:28] but I don't think this team can clear
[03:14:29] this cuz realistically second half he
[03:14:31] gets buffed more and we die but uh I
[03:14:35] don't know why I didn't leave to be fair
[03:14:36] I'm going to implant something just cuz
[03:14:38] I can time for aun you chose The Wrong
[03:14:41] Enemy
[03:14:43] this is double on Jing yeah yeah Jing
[03:14:46] would be way better here but um I don't
[03:14:50] know am I dead if I don't heal uh no
[03:14:53] we're
[03:14:55] fine let's be
[03:14:59] [Music]
[03:15:05] friends s
[03:15:08] Awakening dragon why I replay then cuz
[03:15:10] we're in too deep
[03:15:13] even though I don't think we're getting
[03:15:14] oh my whatever even though I don't think
[03:15:15] we're getting this We're In Too
[03:15:17] Deep We're In Too Deep to
[03:15:20] leave I'm not a quitter
[03:15:24] chat uh I really want to implant here I
[03:15:26] think I have the I don't know if I have
[03:15:28] the special SK point cuz T needs the
[03:15:29] skill and Lua can't heal if I do this
[03:15:32] but I don't care time for a unlucky I'll
[03:15:35] see you
[03:15:40] off welcome
[03:15:44] customers
[03:15:47] confom not threat put for all your put
[03:15:50] forth all of your
[03:15:52] might yeah there's approximately a 1%
[03:15:57] chance
[03:15:59] um yeah okay it's fine I wanted to
[03:16:02] change teams
[03:16:03] anyways but I'm glad the first team
[03:16:05] worked cuz we're running uh I wasn't
[03:16:07] sure if the speed would work on that
[03:16:08] team but the fact that it does is pretty
[03:16:10] cool so pog let me um adjust this cuz
[03:16:14] the comps were doing weren't for uh they
[03:16:17] had nothing to do with the weaknesses I
[03:16:18] might do should I do toaz I don't know
[03:16:20] if I want to gear her
[03:16:22] again um if not we could
[03:16:25] just I mean I could Argent T
[03:16:36] too this probably the team we're
[03:16:41] running
[03:16:45] blade is also fine here
[03:16:51] actually
[03:16:53] Kafka no my CFA is cooked cuz my Luca is
[03:16:56] not built like I don't have anyone built
[03:16:58] a my CFA is fine but no one else
[03:17:01] is topaz in the general I could I'd have
[03:17:04] to reggear them though but I'm actually
[03:17:06] down we could also uh blade is actually
[03:17:09] not bad here cuz blade blade can shred
[03:17:12] these twoo and this is the hard part
[03:17:13] wave one is easy even if we can't
[03:17:19] break but my jinguan kind of sucks I
[03:17:22] can't lie dude he's not bench he just
[03:17:24] sucks why would I play a character like
[03:17:27] he's not bad but like my build of him is
[03:17:29] not ideal like I don't have good relics
[03:17:31] for him so why would I why would I force
[03:17:34] myself in that situation that's all I'm
[03:17:37] asking like he's
[03:17:41] good but but like why would I force
[03:17:43] myself in this wait she's also what the
[03:17:46] [ __ ] is this wait no no this is fine uh
[03:17:48] where the [ __ ] is wait I saw oh that's
[03:17:50] what it is yeah what the [ __ ] is
[03:17:53] this what was that even running on her
[03:17:55] twopiece twopiece right there's no I
[03:17:56] running something that wasn't twopiece
[03:17:57] twopiece but I don't have the new set

[03:26:53] for not really 100 yeah I assume like
[03:26:56] but for now cuz I know it only lasts two
[03:26:59] turns and your Al is supposed to be
[03:27:00] three turns which is why but it's three
[03:27:03] of her
[03:27:04] turns or two of her turns rather well
[03:27:06] both are her
[03:27:08] turns

[03:35:11] well actually it will cuz going to be a
[03:35:12] new
[03:35:14] order does my no but it's his the

[03:35:33] Bank okay first of all I lied if I said
[03:35:36] 100 it would have been believable okay
[03:35:38] 100 gifted Hill gift but if I say 500
[03:35:40] it's so so out of the realm of reality
[03:35:42] that you know it's a joke cuz it's an
[03:35:43] exaggeration it's like if someone says
[03:35:46] hey man I'll give you a billion dollars
[03:35:48] if you hit this shot and then they you
[03:35:50] hit the shot obviously they can't give
[03:35:51] you that much right like it's you can't

[03:39:17] going we're going to do healer healer I
[03:39:18] think the first healer we use is going
[03:39:19] to be lra for skill point efficiency and
[03:39:22] also imaginary weakness and then second
[03:39:25] one we're probably going to
[03:39:27] do fushen might be the play could also H
[03:39:36] um please recommend a free play Lon for
[03:39:38] blade uh on the fall of an Aon you get
[03:39:40] it from Hera shop you can S5
[03:39:42] it alternatively a non-f freet tolay
[03:39:45] option but a fourstar is the Arland one
[03:39:47] whatever that one's called uh Secrets
[03:39:49] vow is that what it's if that's what
[03:39:51] it's called you owe me five gifted oh my
[03:39:53] well a secret vow same
[03:40:03] thing dude stop trying to give advice
[03:40:06] okay how was anything I said
[03:40:07] wrong oh fall of an Aon oh I'm actually
[03:40:11] wait wait what the [ __ ] am I call what
[03:40:13] am I talking about wait wait wait wait I
[03:40:16] meant to
[03:40:18] say uh wait yeah what the [ __ ] am I
[03:40:27] stupid yeah maybe I am
[03:40:34] stupid oh I was thinking of emiter wait
[03:40:36] why the [ __ ] would I say that for blade
[03:40:37] I am stupid yeah secret vow if you can
[03:40:39] get it if you can tough
[03:40:42] luck I'm pretty sure this one uh not
[03:40:45] this one one of the three stars [ __ ]
[03:40:47] sheated like 5% worse than
[03:40:51] uh this one she did like five to 10%
[03:40:55] worse or like 6% than a fourstar but it
[03:40:57] was like the worst fourstar so it's not
[03:40:59] recommended but it's
[03:41:01] cheap but I definitely vow if you
[03:41:08] can do anything else you would
[03:41:16] go I don't think so I mean obviously a
[03:41:18] signature if you have it like obviously
[03:41:19] five star well his signature
[03:41:25] yeah yeah pepega I don't know why I Pepa
[03:41:30] right there Ron
[03:41:32] ma Ron ma is honestly I don't know I
[03:41:35] don't even like it that much I'm going
[03:41:36] to be real it's really good for her cuz
[03:41:38] you get like break effect and a lot of
[03:41:39] stats
[03:41:40] and the damage to your whole team's huge
[03:41:42] but
[03:41:43] like I kind of like the energy from the
[03:41:46] either meshing or memories of the past
[03:41:48] especially if have memories S5 I don't
[03:41:50] know if it's like obviously her
[03:41:52] signature is still good I think it's
[03:41:54] good for
[03:41:55] everyone but for her I really like
[03:41:58] energy I don't
[03:42:03] know I think I like her more than blade
[03:42:06] for your account but I don't know if I
[03:42:07] like her um her lone for her
[03:42:10] specifically Heron's quite good it's
[03:42:12] definitely good it's not bad but it's
[03:42:14] like it's it's like it's good like 20%
[03:42:16] what's the exact amount of damage you
[03:42:17] gain is it 20 or like 30 I don't [ __ ]
[03:42:20] remember dude I don't I don't I don't I
[03:42:23] don't guide this game like I do genin
[03:42:25] but I can look at it for you whatever
[03:42:27] the percentage is where is it oh I don't
[03:42:30] have it uh
[03:42:33] Harmony
[03:42:35] yeah like it's
[03:42:37] good it's definitely good but like you
[03:42:41] don't get three- turn Alt with this is
[03:42:43] that always needed no but I feel like
[03:42:46] you have a really good alternative onon
[03:42:48] may always which is why I don't know I I
[03:42:51] I mean the buff is a lot though like
[03:42:53] it's all your allies especially if
[03:42:55] you're double dpsing it's a lot of
[03:42:57] damage and the break effect is nice and
[03:42:59] then you'll get energy per wave and
[03:43:01] you'll get a skill point well not a
[03:43:02] skill point but skill
[03:43:04] points but I don't think it's like I
[03:43:07] don't think it's some people say it's
[03:43:08] bait some people say it's amazing I
[03:43:09] don't I think it's either like I think
[03:43:10] it's good but I don't think it's like it
[03:43:13] might not be as good as it seems because
[03:43:14] you might get more value by running an
[03:43:16] energy like cone especially if you have
[03:43:18] the one that also gives you break effect
[03:43:19] I think if it's only meshing
[03:43:21] cogs meshing cogs is still good but you
[03:43:23] lose out on a lot of break effect so
[03:43:24] it's not as
[03:43:27] [Music]
[03:43:34] close yeah I don't
[03:43:38] know
[03:43:40] do you want to enter the Forgotten wait
[03:43:43] what was I running on blade why was am I
[03:43:45] am I blanking cuz I was did I always
[03:43:47] pull for this I swear I ran something
[03:43:49] else I used on the fall of an Aon for
[03:43:52] imator and for jinglu I think I might
[03:43:54] have just pulled for
[03:43:55] this I thought I had a forar I used on
[03:43:58] him obviously like secret vow I would
[03:43:59] have used but I didn't I didn't use it
[03:44:00] cuz I would have leveled it huh I guess
[03:44:03] I always used it you just pulled oh
[03:44:08] dum
[03:44:11] do you want to enter
[03:44:13] the Pepe W of course you pulled D I
[03:44:18] don't know why I brain farted okay
[03:44:20] anyways let's just send it wait what the
[03:44:21] [ __ ] our team's didn't save never mind
[03:44:23] GG uh emit dring Le
[03:44:32] BR P we use pea over silver wolf let me
[03:44:35] give her the good like oh she has the
[03:44:36] good like on never mind is she tanky
[03:44:39] enough that's not a lot of HP but I
[03:44:41] don't think she'll die let me just uh
[03:44:42] what the [ __ ] am I running okay maybe we
[03:44:44] do go silver wolf oh never mind I have
[03:44:46] an HP
[03:44:48] body uh wait do
[03:44:51] I it'll be fine I won't
[03:44:55] die yeah we'll just go silverwolf I
[03:44:57] think she's Better
[03:45:04] Built clueless no not clueless surely
[03:45:07] not surely she has better builds where's
[03:45:08] silver wolf
[03:45:10] boom and then we'll do definitely lra
[03:45:12] here and then here we're definitely
[03:45:15] going Ron May and probably who who I
[03:45:19] don't think she'll die if she does we'll
[03:45:21] go Fen but I think we'll be fine she's
[03:45:24] also yeah I kind of [ __ ] her build a
[03:45:26] little yeah we'll be
[03:45:28] fine we'll be
[03:45:30] fine silver fly cone I gave her the
[03:45:33] right one I think right yeah but now I
[03:45:35] have too much hit rate cuz my body is
[03:45:38] hit rate which I don't need I could go
[03:45:41] in HP
[03:45:43] body if I want to not
[03:45:48] die just go crit rate though cuz I don't
[03:45:50] have an HP on
[03:45:57] level but HP is probably
[03:45:59] better have one offset I don't really
[03:46:02] need this
[03:46:08] set
[03:46:26] okay probably won't die okay there's
[03:46:28] actually no way we die now right I think
[03:46:30] we're fine I might need F second half
[03:46:32] but if I do I will
[03:46:38] cry

[04:01:40] talk to me okay don't talk to me okay
[04:01:42] don't talk to me okay don't talk to me
[04:01:44] okay don't talk to
[04:01:50] me I don't want to think about
[04:01:52] 12 oh swarm oh I love the Swarm truce
[04:01:57] thing my favorite oh my favorite my
[04:02:03] favorite at least blade can [ __ ] Kafka
[04:02:06] um that sounded wrong but you know what
[04:02:08] I mean uh second half I really like emit
[04:02:11] against swarm cuz they're imaginary weak
[04:02:13] but these guys aren't which means I
[04:02:15] might have to go like sing
[04:02:18] the honestly lowkey these teams would
[04:02:20] work the exact same teams would probably
[04:02:22] work I can't lie I can't lie these exact
[04:02:24] teams would probably
[04:02:26] work
[04:02:27] um
[04:02:36] yeah another cleans on the
[04:02:39] first yeah I mean true Kafka does
[04:02:42] dominate you
[04:02:46] um
[04:02:50] but swap
[04:02:55] healers yeah and shock we could skill
[04:02:59] point no but but the skill point I mean
[04:03:01] the
[04:03:07] energy
[04:03:09] uh where's uh
[04:03:16] Talent the main upside would
[04:03:21] be I skill three allies and then it
[04:03:24] cleanses all
[04:03:27] three
[04:03:32] right is that the main upside of that is
[04:03:35] there something
[04:03:37] no
[04:03:45] or is it the middle one oh cleanses the
[04:03:47] middle but what does it do with the
[04:03:48] other two just heal let me read it again
[04:03:52] I didn't do anything for hoo to be fair
[04:03:55] there was no ho ho guide so you can
[04:03:57] excuse
[04:04:00] me yeah yeah heal Ally dispel one debuff
[04:04:03] from that Ally oh okay wait but
[04:04:07] it's
[04:04:14] you cleanse every turn it's whatever you
[04:04:16] heal right from Divine
[04:04:20] provision which is her [ __ ]
[04:04:23] Talent yeah after using your skill you
[04:04:25] get Divine provision oh okay it's not
[04:04:26] the skill it's the Divine provision okay
[04:04:28] guide maker how to make a woo guide you
[04:04:31] can chill with
[04:04:33] that okay makes sense but I I think then
[04:04:37] I don't think there's a reason to put
[04:04:38] her first right I mean I guess no but
[04:04:40] it's also imaginary
[04:04:42] week I don't think there's a reason to I
[04:04:45] might want to speed tune my Jing Leu BR
[04:04:48] a bit better
[04:04:49] though
[04:04:56] um Chad should I Crown her Chad should I
[04:04:59] should I get it should I level one level
[04:05:01] 10
[04:05:06] something
[04:05:10] Salo om don't talk to

[04:06:05] it's not that expensive true but I only
[04:06:07] have one
[04:06:11] um should I just level skill I think
[04:06:14] they're all important to be honest but I
[04:06:16] think we just level skill right [ __ ]
[04:06:19] it Talent talent's more crit
[04:06:26] rate and
[04:06:30] this but I think we're doing
[04:06:36] skill
[04:06:40] 72 fantia mats yeah I kind of just
[04:06:41] spammed fantia I'm going to do skill
[04:06:44] level 10 is that my first level 10
[04:06:47] actually wait that's actually my first
[04:06:49] level 10 what the [ __ ] yo I can't wait

[04:07:25] events sorry dude I level every
[04:07:28] character man I don't just have two
[04:07:30] literally literally look look look look

[04:07:40] 9ine here okay okay cely no well a level
[04:07:43] eight but that's not yeah that's not
[04:07:44] that doesn't cost one uhhh nine there
[04:07:50] eight okay not this guy okay to be fair
[04:07:53] there not that many wait there might be
[04:07:55] actually who did I not check silver wolf
[04:07:57] has a nine tenun has no she doesn't emor
[04:08:00] has two nines whatever don't talk to
[04:08:04] me yeah I think these teams are the play
[04:08:07] I might need fan maybe but think we'll
[04:08:10] be fine I I'm worried about my whole
[04:08:13] team getting like cced and shocked and
[04:08:17] [ __ ] by Kafka I'm going be honest but
[04:08:19] I don't know what we can do about that
[04:08:22] except run BR first half but if I run BR
[04:08:24] first half then my jinglu doesn't have
[04:08:26] BR and I don't really like that that's
[04:08:28] not a situation that I enjoy
[04:08:36] personally
[04:08:38] I mean I could do
[04:08:40] this like this uh sorry this could
[04:08:46] work like this is
[04:08:48] fine but I don't really like jinglu as
[04:08:52] much with no
[04:08:59] BR show us your blade um why you acting
[04:09:02] like my blade is bad literally why the
[04:09:05] only problem is that he has like no
[04:09:07] speed here
[04:09:12] Bron crutch
[04:09:15] bro wait can I just do paa here actually
[04:09:18] can I just do
[04:09:19] this H actually no I don't like that as
[04:09:22] I
[04:09:30] mean dude I actually listen I think Dad
[04:09:33] hung in B Lune is the play but I
[04:09:36] actually think we could clear with
[04:09:40] this I actually think we
[04:09:47] could
[04:10:05] clueless well the problem like who no
[04:10:07] crit are you
[04:10:09] saying okay you're saying this okay yeah
[04:10:12] I don't even want to get into
[04:10:24] that okay the the only thing is if I go
[04:10:28] in bit then I don't need
[04:10:36] br
[04:10:38] also I think myun dies I don't think
[04:10:40] she's tanky enough she's on a cuz she's
[04:10:43] on she's also on a three star so like
[04:10:45] her HP total and she has no defense so
[04:10:48] the HP total is not looking promising
[04:10:50] I'm going to be honest uh my body is
[04:10:53] also plus
[04:10:56] 12 dude
[04:11:03] listen
[04:11:06] um
[04:11:18] oh I'm not on speed what the
[04:11:20] [ __ ] well I think it's cuz she was dying
[04:11:22] that's probably why fourstar M dude my
[04:11:26] tun is just like there she's just
[04:11:33] existing dud I have three speed boots on
[04:11:35] this set and they're all taken do I have
[04:11:37] another one
[04:11:43] one I
[04:11:47] don't can also just do
[04:11:52] musketeer let me
[04:11:55] filter yo
[04:12:00] new I'm not playing this guy I could
[04:12:02] actually take this even though the subs
[04:12:04] aren't amazing for her at least there's
[04:12:06] attack
[04:12:07] uh this one is kind of terrible for lra
[04:12:10] I can't
[04:12:11] lie wait let me do this and give that to
[04:12:22] Thea gearing once again BGE no BGE in
[04:12:26] the
[04:12:34] Stream well I actually have a lot of
[04:12:36] hats I probably could level one that's
[04:12:38] good for her ideally speed attack and
[04:12:40] like HP defense but that's probably not
[04:12:42] going to happen this one has speed
[04:12:43] defense attack and effect res actually
[04:12:45] this is pretty good for her but I kind
[04:12:47] of would like Relic XP which I don't
[04:12:50] have which means I'm going to have to
[04:12:51] throw a piece that I already leveled
[04:12:52] which I might
[04:12:54] have probably have a spare piece that
[04:12:56] sucks uh where is it should be in the
[04:12:59] middle
[04:13:01] is that's not bad that's also not bad
[04:13:07] this one's pretty bad I can't
[04:13:14] lie wait
[04:13:16] oo wait kind of Juicy kind of
[04:13:21] Juicy that's pretty [ __ ]

[04:22:22] save
[04:22:23] me but the attack's a lot lower how much
[04:22:27] percentage of our attack does she skill
[04:22:28] off

[04:44:12] middle one for this or can I do it here
[04:44:14] I think I have to Target her
[04:44:18] right or can I just do it on
[04:44:23] T I think I have to Target her but I'm
[04:44:25] afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid
[04:44:33] middle
[04:44:39] Chad would you be mad at me if I rad her
[04:44:42] ability let me be confident in my
[04:44:44] ability to read cuz I didn't make a wo
[04:44:46] guide okay let me be confident in my
[04:44:47] ability to
[04:44:48] read there's skill and there's Talent
[04:44:51] skill REM dispels one debuff from a
[04:44:53] single Target
[04:44:54] Ally okay that's one cleans but
[04:44:59] Talent if H has Divine provision when an
[04:45:01] allies turn
[04:45:02] starts Resto HP at the same
[04:45:08] time dispel one debuff so
[04:45:12] technically technically the turn starts
[04:45:15] she heals it cleanses but does the turn
[04:45:18] so when the turn starts I also take win
[04:45:19] here does the heal go off before the
[04:45:21] wincher does it go heal
[04:45:25] then does it go heal cleans and then no
[04:45:28] wind shear or is it going to be wind
[04:45:30] sheer that I
[04:45:31] die it should go before I'm pretty sure
[04:45:34] it goes before but if my reading c r is
[04:45:36] bad I die but also what if wincher
[04:45:38] doesn't do 752 it's only four Stacks
[04:45:40] [ __ ] it we'll find out only one way to
[04:45:41] find out if we reset this phase it
[04:45:43] doesn't count as a new try for the
[04:45:45] Gambar true it's still first try I think
[04:45:47] it's going to work I think this works I
[04:45:49] I'm confident in my game knowledge
[04:45:52] surely oh we also healed so much anyways
[04:45:54] but we did take the wind shear damage
[04:45:56] but I mean we healed so much anyways
[04:45:57] it's fine it didn't matter like it
[04:45:58] wouldn't yeah it's
[04:46:00] fine wait we did take the damage though
[04:46:02] I mean it doesn't it didn't remove the
[04:46:03] stacks but it did heal us so it
[04:46:09] worked Al about thinking for what that
[04:46:11] was actually useless
[04:46:12] thinking I didn't even need to
[04:46:18] think I might do the Unspeakable and
[04:46:21] jinglu Al to get in her State cuz
[04:46:23] normally with jinglu you don't Al when
[04:46:25] you're not in your enhanced state but if
[04:46:27] I don't I might legit die so I might
[04:46:28] actually have to let me cook for a
[04:46:29] second I we definitely tank two hits
[04:46:33] though
[04:46:35] it cleanse the
[04:46:36] outrage yeah cuz it goes left to right
[04:46:38] on the bottom right we had two debuffs
[04:46:40] is that
[04:46:43] why or does it just not cleanse
[04:46:47] that I think it's cuz it cleansed the
[04:46:49] left
[04:46:50] one okay we're going to start
[04:46:54] with this all will be
[04:46:58] revealed I don't like using this out of
[04:47:00] state normally but I think here it'll at
[04:47:02] least yeah yeah yeah yeah
[04:47:05] then it's still our turn we're going to
[04:47:06] do this and then we're going to run May
[04:47:08] alt and then we're going to skill and
[04:47:10] then we skill again cuz it's our turn
[04:47:11] again oh
[04:47:12] m
[04:47:17] m and then we go again and then we break
[04:47:20] her and break break and break break your
[04:47:24] heart we're only going to break break
[04:47:27] the
[04:47:28] moment your heart we're only going to
[04:47:31] break break break
[04:47:34] wait a second did I just first try did I
[04:47:37] did I just first
[04:47:40] try he it's as don't reive the gamble
[04:47:43] yet let me show you guys let me show
[04:47:45] YouTube viewers what the prediction
[04:47:47] looked like cuz I think I'm just a
[04:47:49] genius because let's say 2.7 million
[04:47:53] Channel points 66% of people are on the
[04:47:55] doubter side where only 1.4 million
[04:47:58] believed in me who's the biggest
[04:47:59] believer dahi you're a real one who's
[04:48:02] the biggest hater
[04:48:04] suzawa okay [ __ ] you
[04:48:08] suzawa hey we actually first tried it
[04:48:14] hey oh what a day and you were King my
[04:48:17] builds and you were K wiing my builds
[04:48:19] you are cheing my
[04:48:23] builds 22 Cycles
[04:48:26] remaining 22 woo 22 that's a lot of cyes
[04:48:31] and you were cing my builds now sit down
[04:48:34] and learn class sit down sorry hey what
[04:48:38] build were you running hey let me show
[04:48:42] you dude AR Lua before you before you
[04:48:44] judge me ARA is literally so plus 10
[04:48:48] attack rope plus 12 ball also do I have
[04:48:51] a fourar piece still no I removed the
[04:48:52] four star piece never mind it's not that
[04:48:53] kick
[04:48:55] W yeah it's not even that kick
[04:48:58] W wallet equal win bro bro bro bro can
[04:49:06] you show your blade yes no err on Lua
[04:49:09] okay that's why I showed it listen I
[04:49:12] don't think attack is optimal but like I
[04:49:14] never need my [ __ ] ult I don't care
[04:49:16] like I literally don't need to ult that
[04:49:17] often it does not matter it just like
[04:49:19] removes the debuff and like helps with
[04:49:21] the field like I don't actually need
[04:49:23] it so [ __ ] it dude I do shortcuts to get
[04:49:27] away with a bit less investment for
[04:49:29] example I don't min max by T I'm like
[04:49:31] [ __ ] it be tanky same with my same with
[04:49:34] my silver wolf bro you think my silver
[04:49:35] Wolf's good she's just on HP she's on
[04:49:38] [ __ ] HP
[04:49:39] HP she has no damage I just don't want
[04:49:42] her to
[04:49:43] die you cycle field faster I know I know
[04:49:46] why ult is important but like I kind of
[04:49:48] don't care I just like also to be fair I
[04:49:50] don't have a spare ER rope like that's
[04:49:52] the main reason if you're wondering why
[04:49:54] I also don't have a spare ER rope it's
[04:49:56] not like it's like calculated but like
[04:49:59] I'd rather give my ER rope to Silver and
[04:50:01] then just have attack it's like whatever
[04:50:07] anyways run me
[04:50:10] W how much break effect on her over 180
[04:50:13] that's all that
[04:50:14] matters we have 164
[04:50:18] plus plus the 20% here o
[04:50:23] tasty now I do a four-star team little
[04:50:25] bro this isn't get an
[04:50:27] [Applause]
[04:50:29] impact
[04:50:31] sorry sorry I I
[04:50:34] will I will sorry I
[04:50:39] will we got a new uh forar I can use I'm

[04:51:53] I'd like next
[04:51:55] time I'd like a few more okay no
[04:51:59] lament what's your team un build meshing
[04:52:02] [ __ ] y m yeah meshing
[04:52:07] cogs springly
[04:52:12] musketeer here are the eidolons I think
[04:52:14] our only high idolon is Ting Yun five
[04:52:17] stars aren't uh but I also use a lot of
[04:52:20] five stars so Pepe W show blade stats we
[04:52:24] just have no speed but everything else
[04:52:25] is really good huge crit rate uh pretty
[04:52:28] a good amount of HP we're just low speed
[04:52:30] but it doesn't matter cuz our brono is
[04:52:32] doing basic skill and then we were
[04:52:34] catching up like it was
[04:52:40] okay our rope also sucks balls but our
[04:52:43] ball is really good it's just our rope
[04:52:45] is really really bad everything else is
[04:52:46] good boots are good body's good uh
[04:52:49] gloves are insane flowers
[04:52:52] are really good so
[04:52:58] yeah cool that was fun you guys want to
[04:53:02] do simulat universe
[04:53:04] show trace level why fine nine and 110
[04:53:10] eight seven and
[04:53:13] nine
[04:53:16] L
[04:53:18] um blade I don't even have this to be
[04:53:21] honest I could get more HP I was
[04:53:23] thinking my HP is good I could literally
[04:53:24] get a free %. should I do it I do play
[04:53:28] blade a lot so I don't think it's wasted
[04:53:30] and HP is good on him not even Max
[04:53:32] traces yeah I
[04:53:34] mean how much HP now anyways who else
[04:53:38] tting Yun yeah t yeah about Yun yeah how
[04:53:43] about
[04:53:48] that BR skill seven is
[04:53:55] Criminal I'm relatable okay I'm
[04:53:57] relatable okay I'm we don't even have
[04:54:01] this listen I'm relatable okay
[04:54:04] if you need everything unlocked to clear
[04:54:07] memory of chaos then then then it's not
[04:54:09] relatable obviously I'd clear obviously
[04:54:14] obviously
[04:54:16] obviously I didn't even have I low key
[04:54:19] you don't want to know how long it took
[04:54:20] me to get like this but this is broken
[04:54:23] but this took
[04:54:24] like no it didn't take that long but
[04:54:32] anyways
[04:54:35] what speed's your bronia 150 or some
[04:54:37] [ __ ]
[04:54:41] 151
[04:54:42] nice wait 40 days oh yeah there's the
[04:54:45] other thing the the the the second one
[04:54:47] the tiers of the
[04:55:02] tear holy [ __ ] I thought people were
[04:55:04] making fun of him when they said the
[04:55:06] stream goes good on mute they weren't
[04:55:08] lying oh my God okay what does that even
[04:55:11] mean literally what does that mean
[04:55:13] explain yourself
[04:55:24] Summoner wait what the [ __ ] well I just
[04:55:27] saw something what is
[04:55:29] this
[04:55:32] oh
[04:55:34] okay of course I have to do a [ __ ]
[04:55:37] mission
[04:55:40] aex dude I'm so broke I
[04:55:43] actually I've missed a few weeks I can't
[04:55:50] lie dude sometimes I just don't claim
[04:55:52] cuz I'm [ __ ] stupid like literally
[04:55:54] I'll like do simulated universe and I
[04:55:56] don't click claim cuz I'm like oh I'll
[04:55:58] just claim it when I stream and then I
[04:55:59] don't
[04:56:02] stream
[04:56:08] I that's why I forgot the battle pass
[04:56:09] once and then they mailed me the rewards
[04:56:11] cuz this game is amazing I forgot the
[04:56:13] battle pass in Gin I got [ __ ] I forgot
[04:56:14] the battle pass here they mailed it to
[04:56:22] me okay with battle pass okay with some
[04:56:24] things it's like you could be like
[04:56:25] laziness but with battle pass it's
[04:56:27] literally I like two things one I like
[04:56:30] the satisfying click at the end when
[04:56:31] it's level 50 or 70 now I guess but at
[04:56:33] least 50 and two I like knowing that I
[04:56:36] have mats in the reserve for example
[04:56:38] let's say I'm like broke on credits I
[04:56:39] like being able to go claim the battle
[04:56:41] pass but if I already claimed the battle
[04:56:42] pass and I'm broke on credits
[04:56:45] then then what then it's just like it's
[04:56:48] just
[04:56:51] sad also it's 3:00 a.m. which means the
[04:56:54] day is going to reset which means let me
[04:56:55] launch genin so I can uh yeah anyways s
[04:57:00] Universe wow I unlocked it in literally
[04:57:02] two seconds
[04:57:08] no don't don't force me
[04:57:16] to wait I like how it just gave me
[04:57:25] propagation this
[04:57:32] new
[04:57:39] has anyone done this yet is it hard not
[04:57:41] the first one but in general cuz swarm I
[04:57:43] remember swarm 5 was lit swarm was very
[04:57:45] fun it was
[04:57:46] hard um what about Golden gears not
[04:57:50] hard is that
[04:57:55] fun yep it's hard someone said it's hard
[04:57:59] as [ __ ] then someone else said too easy
[04:58:00] LOL W okay
[04:58:04] I'm hard okay all right the last
[04:58:08] difficulties are terrifying okay okay
[04:58:09] okay we might do it I might finish it SE
[04:58:12] like I'll do it now but I think we might
[04:58:13] finish it on a separate stream let me
[04:58:15] just do the first one I guess
[04:58:24] erudition I don't have any erudition oh
[04:58:26] no I have Argentine
[04:58:32] mind
[04:58:34] is there a
[04:58:37] Healer that I want to
[04:58:48] play than I don't really care about that
[04:58:51] okay
[04:58:55] fine sure let's move
[04:59:02] on
[04:59:03] he thinks he's going to stream HSR
[04:59:05] before the next half copium why are you
[04:59:07] typing copium to that why is that
[04:59:12] copium Trotter
[04:59:18] extrapolation cognition
[04:59:22] value
[04:59:31] okay why is someone called kissing AR
[04:59:33] lino in my twitch
[04:59:51] chat base
[04:59:58] chatter wait what is this oh dude I
[05:00:00] don't like this one it makes it blank so
[05:00:02] you don't get Rewards
[05:00:04] the [ __ ] is the point of that oh wait
[05:00:06] you do get the rewards I'm stupid I
[05:00:07] couldn't read never mind that's
[05:00:09] good can I get an irir addition one I
[05:00:11] want to see what they do okay never mind
[05:00:15] I can't [ __ ] you I didn't read it the
[05:00:17] blue one the blue one is change it blank
[05:00:19] and you get
[05:00:21] nothing or you change it to a combat
[05:00:24] what yeah maybe it's to change it to a
[05:00:25] combat I don't know there's a
[05:00:27] destruction path one like that but it's
[05:00:28] been a while since I've done normal
[05:00:31] swarm
[05:00:36] what oh I see
[05:00:39] sure okay okay
[05:00:46] okay like one domain and copy to the
[05:00:51] adjacent wait give me give me two give
[05:00:53] me two give me this boom no I mean
[05:00:56] that's fine let's just go
[05:01:01] up
[05:01:07] you you're going get a response I'm
[05:01:09] lighting the candle [ __ ] it random
[05:01:10] rewards give me random rewards nice
[05:01:16] okay this domain can move to a domain in
[05:01:19] the closest column that contains either
[05:01:20] a blessing Trotter or a curial troter ro
[05:01:22] gain are doubled wait there's a troter
[05:01:23] here but I kind of wanted to do that can
[05:01:25] I do it on this no blessing troter Cur
[05:01:28] troter so this
[05:01:31] one
[05:01:34] double
[05:01:39] rewards
[05:01:48] Glory all will be swept away by the
[05:01:53] wind background music I had it disabled
[05:01:55] for the last thing I mean enabled so or
[05:01:57] like I didn't have like music playing
[05:01:59] protect all
[05:02:01] Beauty
[05:02:10] okay it's a bit
[05:02:12] loud dude my posture is so
[05:02:15] cooked
[05:02:16] o wait that's increased defense why did
[05:02:19] I click that whatever it's new
[05:02:20] rationalities fall present the Cur is
[05:02:22] the equivalent of one passing of each
[05:02:24] path okay after entering a domain its
[05:02:27] content will be immediately replaced by
[05:02:29] that of an elite domain after entering
[05:02:33] a combat or Elite domain two times will
[05:02:35] be destroyed and get 200
[05:02:38] fragments okay take
[05:02:47] that game's a bit loud it is but that's
[05:02:51] okay care to test your skills wonder how
[05:02:54] many planes
[05:03:01] are
[05:03:05] existence is
[05:03:09] Unity dude I'm so [ __ ] tired
[05:03:16] already wait what during the boss fight
[05:03:19] in the third plane resonance
[05:03:21] extrapolation will occur reson types of
[05:03:23] path to Resonance and have a serious
[05:03:24] impact on all allies during later
[05:03:26] challenges you can p effect as simulated
[05:03:29] by resonance
[05:03:31] extrapolation
[05:03:34] enjoying yourself wait what the [ __ ]
[05:03:36] they just used the hunt against me
[05:03:37] that's
[05:03:38] cheating what the
[05:03:46] [ __ ] that's a little damage but this is
[05:03:48] difficulty one I assume it'll be a lot
[05:03:50] harder
[05:03:56] later um give me
[05:04:01] Dwayne oh World completed I got one
[05:04:04] Stellar
[05:04:21] Jade compliment is cute
[05:04:27] Avatar I am Alpha yo True by the way
[05:04:31] True by the the way true true
[05:04:36] true I'm so glad starel
[05:04:40] agrees where's aboba we got gifted 54 to
[05:04:43] remove it so it's 55 to reimplement
[05:04:45] reinstate
[05:05:01] aboba
[05:05:06] okay a lot of lot of
[05:05:11] gems wait so how do I let's want to do
[05:05:13] another difficulty how do I do that oh
[05:05:20] oh what the [ __ ] is conundrum
[05:05:29] mode okay we'll try this
[05:05:31] later
[05:05:36] do you think it's harder than
[05:05:39] mo2 it's even harder
[05:05:45] uhoh I like it though I like the Swarm
[05:05:47] mode a lot swarm five was really fun cuz
[05:05:49] it felt like your choices mattered like
[05:05:51] you actually went for good
[05:06:01] Buffs
[05:06:11] was mlc2 fun yeah I enjoyed
[05:06:13] it we'll try with different teams later
[05:06:16] you don't get the skill tree then five
[05:06:18] is really hard I see oh yeah I mean
[05:06:20] that's like how swarm five was kind of
[05:06:22] like I did I still don't I didn't get
[05:06:24] propagation uh and I did five but it's a
[05:06:27] lot easier if you get
[05:06:30] it nothing's hard if you have claraa
[05:06:32] dude [ __ ] you I don't have claraa I have
[05:06:38] hook I have
[05:06:49] Kafka okay I don't like the way I talked
[05:06:51] about Ron May's build earlier so let me
[05:06:54] go over it again so that if it's
[05:06:56] uploaded on my second Channel then it's
[05:06:58] not going to be as scuffed as the last
[05:07:01] one was cuz I'm not happy with the way I
[05:07:02] explained it so let me say it
[05:07:06] again GG I'll be fast though this is
[05:07:09] going to be the
[05:07:12] fastest fastest Ron May build
[05:07:14] explanation possible fastest one
[05:07:18] especially having played her longer now
[05:07:20] okay okay cool so you probably know what
[05:07:22] she does if you don't just a bunch of
[05:07:24] Buffs okay alt insane res pen increase
[05:07:27] which means you basically ignore
[05:07:28] resistances well yeah you penetrate
[05:07:30] through them which means you're going to
[05:07:31] do more damage especially against
[05:07:32] enemies that have high resistance but
[05:07:33] always basically I mean yeah just like
[05:07:34] literally always uh uh and she does a
[05:07:37] ton of break effect damage because
[05:07:39] you're building break effect on her why
[05:07:40] are you building break effect on her a
[05:07:41] few reasons but primarily this ability
[05:07:44] uh which is insane it gives you your
[05:07:45] team more damage percent up to 36%
[05:07:48] damage which is just broken you're going
[05:07:50] to have 100% up time on this because
[05:07:51] it's from your skill uh based on how
[05:07:53] much break effect you have past 120
[05:07:56] capping at 180 so you want 180 break
[05:07:58] effect but you might think that's a lot
[05:07:59] it is but you get a ton for free you get
[05:08:01] 57 .3 for free through all of these
[05:08:05] minor traces you should unlock and this
[05:08:07] 20% that triggers when you're on field
[05:08:09] so whatever your break effect is uh
[05:08:11] basically you need 160 when you look
[05:08:13] here because see 164 but when I'm on
[05:08:14] field it'll be
[05:08:16] 184 so that's huge uh also skill is g to
[05:08:21] sorry Talent is going to give speed to
[05:08:22] your whole team all the time and you
[05:08:25] also get well through the I guess we'll
[05:08:27] talk one at a time Talent you also get
[05:08:28] more break effect whenever you're yeah
[05:08:31] okay you're building break effect on her
[05:08:32] so her breaks going to be good but on
[05:08:34] top of just when she breaks when an ally
[05:08:36] breaks she'll also do her break damage
[05:08:38] Ice Break damage um which scales on your
[05:08:40] break effect and is just a nice bonus
[05:08:42] amount of damage but that's not even the
[05:08:44] main part of her kit the main part of
[05:08:45] her kit is all the Buffs which as I said
[05:08:46] is speed that this res Pan the speed and
[05:08:50] this insane amount of damage but also in
[05:08:52] additional basically the same amount
[05:08:54] almost the same amount up to 32 out T
[05:08:56] level 10 from your uh skills Talent
[05:08:58] itself this gives you just damage when
[05:09:00] you use your skill and this last for
[05:09:02] three turns which means you just have to
[05:09:03] skill and then you can basic attack
[05:09:05] basic attack and then skill again very
[05:09:06] efficient and it takes down at the start
[05:09:09] of Ron's turn Okay so she goes three
[05:09:12] times and then it expires this means
[05:09:14] that if you move faster it'll tick down
[05:09:17] faster but speed is still generally good
[05:09:18] so you can go more attack more and as
[05:09:20] long as you're not like way faster than
[05:09:21] your whole team it's nice to have some
[05:09:23] speed uh
[05:09:25] generally I think that's about it um
[05:09:28] yeah I mean you also get energy at the
[05:09:30] start of your turn which is just like
[05:09:31] cool uh you also get this damage buff
[05:09:34] which we talked about and the break
[05:09:35] effect which we talked about I think
[05:09:36] that's it technique is really good
[05:09:38] too um technique is really good but
[05:09:40] technique a technique but yeah you
[05:09:41] trigger skill you don't get energy from
[05:09:43] this but it triggers the skill and then
[05:09:44] there's bonus Buffs for simulated
[05:09:46] Universe which is very POG um
[05:09:51] yeah
[05:09:54] also
[05:09:56] yeah I think I skipped over there's also
[05:09:58] this yeah also after you break uh the oh
[05:10:02] yeah there's weakness break efficiency
[05:10:04] how do I not mention that where is that
[05:10:05] why didn't I read it I just know there
[05:10:06] is that yeah the skill also gives you
[05:10:07] weakness break efficiency which isn't
[05:10:09] the same as weakness break like damage
[05:10:10] or how good it is it's literally more
[05:10:12] efficient which means you break Shields
[05:10:13] faster which is so good and she also
[05:10:15] delays the actions um longer based on
[05:10:18] her break
[05:10:19] effect yeah delaying their actions
[05:10:23] like yeah so she delays them longer so
[05:10:26] that's what she
[05:10:29] does yeah Pon City true I think I forgot
[05:10:33] I think that's it
[05:10:38] right think that's
[05:10:44] it relics please yeah we're getting
[05:10:46] there yeah TLD drr of her kit a ton of
[05:10:50] Buffs damage damage speed and weakness
[05:10:54] break efficiency with the talent where
[05:10:56] is it I'm clicking on the wrong things
[05:10:58] yeah and then basically more damage by
[05:11:00] ignoring resistances and then speed
[05:11:02] efficiency and also you delay actions
[05:11:04] longer and you give
[05:11:06] everyone break effect and you also give
[05:11:09] more damage it's just yeah so a lot of
[05:11:12] stuff the rest we talked about already
[05:11:15] but if you weren't there um so
[05:11:19] lyone no actually yeah lyone pretty this
[05:11:22] weapon is sick by the way but you
[05:11:23] usually want an S5 because if you have
[05:11:25] an S5 or meshing cogs which is a free to
[05:11:27] play with lone you can get your alt
[05:11:28] every three turns which is great um
[05:11:32] however you can also do things like
[05:11:33] running an energy buffing support like
[05:11:35] wo who's generally really good with her
[05:11:37] uh healer or you could uh and you will
[05:11:39] run an
[05:11:41] but and that can help outside of that
[05:11:44] you typically run an energy recharge
[05:11:45] rope and either vwac or peny and then
[05:11:48] with those Plus either meshing cogs R S5
[05:11:50] or memories of the past S5 you will get
[05:11:52] your alt every three turns you can also
[05:11:55] get it like faster if you get hit or a
[05:11:57] new wave starts with your signature
[05:11:58] lyone which we'll talk about but
[05:11:59] generally these two energy lyones are
[05:12:01] really good and memories of the past
[05:12:02] gives you a ton of break effect which is
[05:12:03] great I'm pretty sure you do need it S5
[05:12:05] though to get your alter three turns but
[05:12:08] uh I still got it at lower super in
[05:12:10] position because I'm running someone
[05:12:11] like wo and have other sources of energy
[05:12:13] mainly her um so yeah other supportive
[05:12:16] lones are good too um like you can do
[05:12:18] like this or dance dance dance but uh
[05:12:21] usually it's one of these two for energy
[05:12:23] and this one gives break effect as well
[05:12:24] memories of the past or her signature
[05:12:26] lone signature lone I think is good A
[05:12:29] lot of people say it's either broken or
[05:12:31] bait I think it's somewhere in the
[05:12:32] middle it's really good if you don't
[05:12:34] have an alternative and even if you do
[05:12:36] like it's good it's a lot of break
[05:12:37] effect 24% damage to all your party
[05:12:39] members which is just good damage and
[05:12:41] you can get a skill point and uh from
[05:12:43] time to time it's uh it's when you Al
[05:12:46] right yeah and you get a skill point
[05:12:47] when you Al and you get energy at the
[05:12:49] start of every wave the problem is
[05:12:50] there's not many waves usually it's like
[05:12:51] two waves for memory of chaos um but
[05:12:54] it's still a nice amount of energy the
[05:12:55] main thing is the break effect and the
[05:12:57] damage to all your party the only
[05:12:59] problem is you might struggle with
[05:13:00] having enough well you'll usually do an
[05:13:02] ALT every four turns there's ways to get
[05:13:03] a three turn alt like if the wave just
[05:13:06] starts and you have like a energy buffer
[05:13:07] like wo ho or you get hit like once or
[05:13:09] twice there's way there's there's ways
[05:13:11] but a lot of the times you'll just Al
[05:13:12] every four turns Which is less uptime
[05:13:14] which isn't as good but you make up for
[05:13:15] it by getting a lot of damage and stats
[05:13:17] here so it's pretty decent I think E1 is
[05:13:20] better personally but it's a decent lone
[05:13:22] I just think the meshing Cog I think
[05:13:24] there's so many good Alternatives that
[05:13:25] it's not like needed like it's a really
[05:13:27] good lyone but there's an amazing
[05:13:29] alternative with this especially S5 or
[05:13:31] genuinely even meshing cogs it's just
[05:13:32] the stats are going to be
[05:13:34] lower that's all um but it's pretty
[05:13:37] decent and it looks cool her E1 by the
[05:13:39] way if you don't know is literally 20%
[05:13:41] uh defense ignore which is huge it's
[05:13:43] like you alt damage dealt from all
[05:13:45] allies ignores defense 20% Which is just
[05:13:47] great um and defense ignore and uh
[05:13:51] resistance ignore is pretty rare and
[05:13:53] it's not like damage Buffs where it's
[05:13:55] diminishing returns with these it's like
[05:13:57] the more you get the better they are
[05:13:58] generally speaking so it's just really
[05:14:00] good uh it's going to bu your damage a
[05:14:02] lot build
[05:14:05] wise pretty easy um build wise usually
[05:14:07] just go TW piece two piece twopiece CU
[05:14:09] there's no amazing four piece for her um
[05:14:11] like you could technically go four piece
[05:14:12] messenger but it's kind of not that good
[05:14:15] like it's just a bit more speed and it's
[05:14:16] only for one turn uh and it can mess
[05:14:18] some things up but usually it's just
[05:14:19] fine uh star ler 30 months typically you
[05:14:23] just go twopiece two piece two piece
[05:14:24] Thief 16 break effect twopiece messenger
[05:14:26] 6% speed you can also go four piece
[05:14:28] meteor uh or Thief but here and it's
[05:14:32] just another 60% break effect which is
[05:14:33] good
[05:14:35] however the energy you gain here is only
[05:14:37] when you weakness break so it's kind of
[05:14:39] inconsistent it could help like you
[05:14:40] might be able to get your alt a little
[05:14:42] bit faster if you like weakness break a
[05:14:43] bunch but it is a bit inconsistent uh
[05:14:46] outside of that your stats you want 180
[05:14:48] break effect well technically 160
[05:14:49] because you get 20 on field and
[05:14:51] technically you also get uh I think 37.2
[05:14:54] other break effect through your traces
[05:14:55] and you might have break effect through
[05:14:56] your signature so you get a lot but you
[05:14:58] want to hit 180 factoring this in so 60
[05:15:01] without it uh and then after that you
[05:15:04] can get more break effect it's not bad
[05:15:06] but it's not as important speed is
[05:15:07] really good uh and HP and defense for
[05:15:10] just tankiness you don't really need
[05:15:12] anything else speed is great just don't
[05:15:14] like you don't want to be like way
[05:15:15] faster than your whole team at least
[05:15:17] from my understanding speed tuning is
[05:15:18] weird and depends on like 50 million
[05:15:19] things but uh you want to be pretty fast
[05:15:21] you want to be faster than like you
[05:15:23] don't to be like way faster than
[05:15:24] everyone especially if you have like a
[05:15:24] really slow DPS because your Buffs
[05:15:27] expire at the start of your turn so
[05:15:28] let's say you're like going you go three
[05:15:31] times s and your DPS goes twice and then
[05:15:33] it's like their turn again and then your
[05:15:34] ALS not active you don't have the damage
[05:15:36] buff or the res pen so be mindful of
[05:15:39] that but in general speed's good and
[05:15:41] then for your other pieces you just want
[05:15:42] to go tankiness so
[05:15:44] like um was I saying yeah sorry the sub
[05:15:48] the sub
[05:15:49] off [ __ ] you sorry that was toxic
[05:15:52] Soldier five months one sec anyways uh
[05:15:55] that my bad for your body you want HP or
[05:15:57] defense ball as well HP defense usually
[05:15:59] go one or the other uh it doesn't really
[05:16:01] matter
[05:16:02] um and then your planner twopiece you're
[05:16:03] going to go I didn't even talk about
[05:16:05] planner sets you usually go p uh I
[05:16:08] talked about this earlier though I don't
[05:16:09] really feel like repeating this but I
[05:16:10] will for your planner sets there's a few
[05:16:12] you can go you usually go either
[05:16:14] pentacon or vwac for 5% energy pentacon
[05:16:17] is really good if you have another ice
[05:16:18] in your party like Jing theu because
[05:16:19] it'll buff them 10% damage that's great
[05:16:22] uh if not vwac is fine same 5% energy
[05:16:24] and then another small effect uh outside
[05:16:27] of that you might not need the energy
[05:16:28] especially if you're not going for a
[05:16:29] three- turn alt other sets you can go
[05:16:31] are either broken kill to give you crit
[05:16:33] damage to your team Fleet of the agess
[05:16:35] for some attack or the set that I don't
[05:16:37] even have but that's not bad a lot of
[05:16:38] break effect let me find it it's called
[05:16:41] like Talia I think uh where the [ __ ] is
[05:16:43] it relics planner there it is Talia you
[05:16:46] get 60% break effect and then 20% if you
[05:16:48] have 145 speed which you can get so 20
[05:16:51] plus 16 36 pretty good but usually
[05:16:55] you're going like for the energy if
[05:16:56] you're trying to three turn Al so yeah
[05:16:59] uh outside of that you want an ER rope
[05:17:00] break again if you don't need the energy
[05:17:02] for whatever reason and you're like okay
[05:17:04] I'll just ult every four turns or
[05:17:05] whatever it is you can go for a break
[05:17:07] effect rope that's okay but you can't
[05:17:10] build uh energy on your stats energy is
[05:17:12] not a sub stat right break effect is so
[05:17:14] you can usually get enough break effect
[05:17:16] and other stats through your subs
[05:17:17] whereas energy regen you can't so I
[05:17:19] value it especially for long fights I
[05:17:21] think it's great go energy regen rope
[05:17:23] usually speed boots uh and then a
[05:17:25] defensive body and a defensive by
[05:17:26] defensive I mean HP or defense for ball
[05:17:28] and H body pog I think that's it that
[05:17:32] was pretty fast it was like three
[05:17:33] minutes five minutes that was more than
[05:17:35] three why is bro rushing CU you have
[05:17:37] things to do and places to be and I
[05:17:39] talked about this earlier but now I feel
[05:17:40] a bit more in uh uh like I kind of knew
[05:17:43] how to build her but I didn't have time
[05:17:44] to play her now I had time to play her
[05:17:46] so I wanted to re-record it is there
[05:17:49] anything
[05:17:53] else maybe I shouldn't be rushing as
[05:17:57] much just make sure you unlock all of
[05:17:58] her traces they're very important uh for
[05:18:00] the most part like yeah especially the
[05:18:03] big the major ones E1 is great if you
[05:18:05] want it you don't need it I mean yeah
[05:18:07] her addons are pretty good but you don't
[05:18:08] need them like I cleared with ezero um
[05:18:12] who is she good with oh we didn't talk
[05:18:13] about teams teams woo okay everyone
[05:18:17] literally almost everyone she's cracked
[05:18:20] with like any DPS you can even do double
[05:18:21] DPS teams if you want you can literally
[05:18:23] run her with like Kafka uh you can run
[05:18:25] her with let's say a followup attack
[05:18:27] team you're playing topaz and jinglu
[05:18:29] boom you can cuz her buff is literally
[05:18:31] buffing everything and then it it only
[05:18:33] exp it loses one turn at the start of
[05:18:34] her turn so it's like everything can go
[05:18:36] your lightning Lord can go your jinguan
[05:18:38] can go everything can go and then it's
[05:18:39] her turn whatever like it literally
[05:18:40] Buffs everyone the speed buff is also
[05:18:42] permanent which can affect everyone and
[05:18:45] uh you ignore resistances you get damage
[05:18:47] it's just amazing
[05:18:50] um I think a lot of the times in a team
[05:18:53] comp you're running a carry a Healer and
[05:18:56] then two either buffing or debuffing
[05:18:58] supports I think typically it's good to
[05:19:02] run Ron May and then another either
[05:19:05] Harmony or nil or a second carry I would
[05:19:08] say I like running another Harmony
[05:19:09] because you can give yourself more
[05:19:11] damage on top or like attack right and
[05:19:13] another action here here it's attack and
[05:19:15] energy which is very valuable um on top
[05:19:18] of the res pen that you're getting here
[05:19:20] and everything else you can also do like
[05:19:23] Ron may and like silver wolf or paa but
[05:19:26] I think that because Ron already helps
[05:19:28] you shred
[05:19:29] resistances could be more more valuable
[05:19:31] to have someone that lets you go again
[05:19:33] or like lets you ult more often stuff
[05:19:35] like that but you really can't go wrong
[05:19:40] um
[05:19:42] yeah I think healer wise obviously you
[05:19:45] could use anyone but I think
[05:19:48] um I think wo is particularly nice cuz
[05:19:51] she gives you energy to your whole team
[05:19:52] and energy is very valuable on her and
[05:19:53] could allow you
[05:19:54] to
[05:19:56] like I don't know be less strict with
[05:19:58] your rotation I guess uh it can depend
[05:20:00] on your likeone too like if you're
[05:20:02] always three- turn alting without her
[05:20:03] it's fine but I think wo is just in
[05:20:04] general really
[05:20:05] good um but all the healers are good
[05:20:08] like L is great F's great Lynx is great
[05:20:10] right it's
[05:20:13] fine she's also really good with two
[05:20:15] DPSS because she Buffs everyone like
[05:20:18] she'll yeah her Buffs are just insane
[05:20:20] like it's not like okay you buff one
[05:20:21] character when you skill you literally
[05:20:22] skill on yourself you first of all you
[05:20:25] always give speed to everyone when you
[05:20:26] skill yourself all of your allies damage
[05:20:28] is increased then you ult all of your
[05:20:29] allies damage is increased by reducing
[05:20:32] resistance or ignoring resistance and
[05:20:34] it's just like and more damage here it's
[05:20:36] like you're literally buffing everything
[05:20:37] so like in a hyper carry team like we're
[05:20:39] playing with jinglu it's great but even
[05:20:41] if you want to double carry you're not
[05:20:42] losing out on any of the Buffs basically
[05:20:44] Jing Leu winess my every move the [ __ ]
[05:20:48] my suffering wait blade has a separate
[05:20:50] voice line with
[05:20:52] jingu what did bro just say what the
[05:20:57] [ __ ]
[05:21:00] anyways
[05:21:02] um I think that's mostly it Jing the one
[05:21:05] two let me try
[05:21:09] it that broken sword you don't want to
[05:21:13] let go of the past do you blade
[05:21:19] damn
[05:21:22] flush do you blade sorry that was weird
[05:21:26] anyways yeah I think that's mostly it
[05:21:28] did I forget
[05:21:30] anything
[05:21:47] Trace
[05:21:49] priority uh I'm pretty sure
[05:21:52] it's wait let me remember I'm pretty
[05:21:54] sure it's
[05:21:58] skill skill and ALT skill and ALT Talent
[05:22:01] right I'm pretty sure skill and ALT are
[05:22:03] pretty similar but I think it should be
[05:22:04] skill alts
[05:22:05] Talent uh but I can check I mean you
[05:22:08] could also
[05:22:09] like actually wait the res pin is really
[05:22:11] good it they should be about as good I'm
[05:22:13] pretty sure Alton skill will be very
[05:22:15] similar I can double check though but
[05:22:17] Alton skill should be very similar
[05:22:19] because res Pen's very valuable and
[05:22:20] damage buff is very valuable but I
[05:22:22] assume you have a lot of damage like
[05:22:24] there's probably more damage Buffs
[05:22:25] you're getting which means the more
[05:22:27] you're getting is a bit less valuable
[05:22:28] whereas res tread you probably don't
[05:22:29] have as much or res ignore so I assume
[05:22:31] alt might be slightly
[05:22:34] better I can I can fact
[05:22:38] check but yeah level level both Alton
[05:22:41] skill and then Talent a bit worse but
[05:22:43] it's still speed which is
[05:22:45] nice so
[05:22:55] yeah is BR replaceable by Ron May and
[05:22:58] jingu paila sustain yes but I think
[05:23:01] you'd rather replace your Pila there
[05:23:04] like for example I did a jingle clear
[05:23:06] with um T Yun I did so let's say
[05:23:13] Okay I I was doing so okay this was like
[05:23:16] my default jinglu team was jinglu bronia
[05:23:19] let's say pil or silver wolf it doesn't
[05:23:21] like both are good but uh where's
[05:23:24] pil where the [ __ ] is pail pil and then
[05:23:28] healer I I literally just did this cuz p
[05:23:32] is great but she mostly shreds like
[05:23:34] defense and stuff
[05:23:37] um so I just I feel okay how do I say
[05:23:40] this if you're going to choose one I
[05:23:41] feel like Bron a lot of the times will
[05:23:43] help you just get way more stats and go
[05:23:45] again so you can basically do two
[05:23:47] actions at once so usually I'd replace
[05:23:48] the nil um and even when my bronny
[05:23:52] wasn't available I did Ting Yun and then
[05:23:55] run may I can't find the character for
[05:23:56] some reason but I did Ting Yun and then
[05:23:58] Ron May and it worked really well um but
[05:24:01] you can also use
[05:24:11] P
[05:24:23] anyways you have S Swan Jing Li though
[05:24:25] yeah Swan Jing Li does change well I
[05:24:27] mean does it even change it obviously uh
[05:24:30] it's great to have more defense uh
[05:24:33] ignore no sorry defense reduction with
[05:24:35] the E1
[05:24:37] right wait
[05:24:43] no wait what the [ __ ] was I thinking
[05:24:45] about oh this is what gives you more
[05:24:47] defense okay never mind I was thinking
[05:24:49] about the S1 I was thinking about S1
[05:24:50] yeah lone lyone is really nice to have
[05:24:53] uh is that what you're talking about why
[05:24:55] why would you say you one oh s
[05:24:58] okay S1 I see yeah I agree with Lyon
[05:25:02] more defense reduction is is nice but I
[05:25:05] don't know if it would actually still be
[05:25:07] better though because BR giving you
[05:25:09] another turn basically is really
[05:25:17] nice really good a stack def yeah for
[05:25:25] [Music]
[05:25:29] sure
[05:25:34] gen dailies I
[05:25:37] will actually will
[05:25:39] I surely
[05:25:42] right I think that's
[05:25:50] it m past S1 or meshing cogs S5 meshing
[05:25:54] cogs is typically better until you have
[05:25:57] S5 memories of the past because if not
[05:25:59] you can't three turn alt but you can
[05:26:00] three turn Al through other sources like
[05:26:03] energy buffing supports or energ
[05:26:05] supports that give you energy or you get
[05:26:07] hit or whatever it is then obviously
[05:26:09] memories of the past will be better
[05:26:10] because more stats and break effect
[05:26:11] that's usually what it is so meshing
[05:26:13] cogs will always give you enough energy
[05:26:15] at S5 memories of the past will but only
[05:26:17] at S5 so until then you might need like
[05:26:19] something to buff you energy or you
[05:26:22] accept that you're for turn
[05:26:27] alting
[05:26:29] yep
[05:26:35] anyways now we're going to do memory of
[05:26:37] chaos 13 no what did I just say no Flor
[05:26:40] but anyways now we do memory Kos 12 wow
[05:26:43] we're going to play jinglu with Ron May
[05:26:45] and woo that normally in this team I run
[05:26:47] either BR or paila uh one of the two um
[05:26:51] but in this iteration we're running our
[05:26:52] BR and the other team and I use tun for
[05:26:55] even more energy so that's what we ran
[05:26:56] it was great wow I can't wait to
[05:26:58] Showcase Ron May in action great Buffs
[05:27:01] wait we might show 11 and 12 I don't
[05:27:03] know I don't know how long I want this
[05:27:03] video to be but we might show 11 and 12
[05:27:05] 11 had BR but I was kind of more Pega
[05:27:07] and
[05:27:10] 11 I don't know I was kind of talking
[05:27:12] fast through this I hope it was still
[05:27:13] fine cuz I wanted to make this fast ha
[05:27:17] okay Ron May LOL W
[05:27:26] okay I didn't say
[05:27:29] that
[05:27:31] okay we'll do the new swarm later
[05:27:33] then did I do my
[05:27:36] dailies I
[05:27:38] did am I uncapped I
[05:27:45] am when is
[05:27:48] later
[05:27:50] um soon I'm I'm going to stream again
[05:27:54] soon I
[05:27:56] am I might be at the other setup though
[05:27:58] like in like two days
[05:28:01] it'll probably be genin stream and
[05:28:04] then okay there's going to be another
[05:28:06] star one within within before next
[05:28:08] character there has to be cuz I still
[05:28:11] have a lot to do I feel like it's going
[05:28:12] to be before Dr
[05:28:14] ratio if I'm wrong yell at
[05:28:20] me just like Elder ring soon okay you're
[05:28:25] wrong
[05:28:29] okay
[05:28:44] oh yeah also our run May if you're
[05:28:45] wondering is S5 memories of the past
[05:28:47] we're on two-piece twopiece as I said
[05:28:49] with penan and cuz we're running jinglu
[05:28:51] and we're on level eight traces only
[05:28:53] because it's a new boss and ezo wow we
[05:28:57] have 148 speed we have enough break
[05:28:59] effect with our passive trace and we're
[05:29:02] like kind of tanky could be better but
[05:29:04] it's pretty good did I say S5
[05:29:08] S4 did I say S5 oh whatever S4 memories
[05:29:11] of the
[05:29:12] past it should be S5 cuz eight energy
[05:29:15] usually but I'm running whoo so it makes
[05:29:16] up for it like usually you want it S5
[05:29:18] but we're running so
[05:29:21] fine why 148 speed cuz that's how many I
[05:29:24] got for my sub
[05:29:28] stats all right that's all freak
[05:29:30] [Music]
[05:29:40] you dude it's so late I was going to
[05:29:42] swap the genin but lowkey late
[05:29:46] um man I can do my
[05:29:51] commissions all I'm getting do dot teams
[05:29:54] I
[05:29:54] think it's like it's definitely fine cuz
[05:29:57] you get so you get Perma speed and you
[05:29:59] just get damage bonus to everything like
[05:30:01] it's not going to be like and the break
[05:30:03] effect's also nice the break efficiency
[05:30:05] and her break
[05:30:06] damage uh are yeah it should be
[05:30:13] good yeah and res pen
[05:30:21] yeah and speed I don't remember if I
[05:30:23] said that or
[05:30:29] not
[05:30:34] TR if CF get a fivar do unit it's not
[05:30:35] going to be broken
