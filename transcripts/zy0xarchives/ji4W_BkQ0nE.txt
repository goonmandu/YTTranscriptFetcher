[00:00:00] time to head to the next stop let's meet
[00:00:02] up with everyone in the Parlor car hey
[00:00:05] guys hey hey heo stay in the
[00:00:09] train bom pom knows how to keep people
[00:00:11] on the edge of their
[00:00:14] seats no 490 for pentoney dies of cringe
[00:00:18] passers something important came up
[00:00:24] so huh but I only just finished packing
[00:00:28] my bag
[00:00:30] okay we're probably going to do I just
[00:00:32] want to get to penin so I have the new
[00:00:33] area we're going to go then we're going
[00:00:35] to do new pure fiction memory of chaos
[00:00:39] and maybe swarm I think p is located
[00:00:44] inana usually this wouldn't be a huge
[00:00:47] problem sure Las Vegas I know Penton is
[00:00:49] a colony belonging to the harmony family
[00:00:52] it when in Rome as they say don't worry
[00:00:56] conductor Rome anyway
[00:01:00] I could turn St up
[00:01:02] after I hope that while you're all on
[00:01:05] vacation what nameless allow me to
[00:01:08] explain sure than youo just like most of
[00:01:10] the worlds that the express calls at
[00:01:12] penone is one of the stops along the
[00:01:15] silver tracks several Millennia ago it
[00:01:18] was an IPC Frontier prison and it was
[00:01:21] the trailblaze that connected it to
[00:01:22] thousands of stars during that time the
[00:01:25] astral Express once visited pentacon as
[00:01:28] with all meetings they inevitably lead
[00:01:30] to goodbyes as the Express's logs
[00:01:33] indicate it seems some passengers
[00:01:36] decided to
[00:01:37] call
[00:01:38] home is that a rare happening don't
[00:01:41] worry just think of it as returning to
[00:01:43] your hometown following the Express's
[00:01:45] departure the Stellar Rons cut off
[00:01:47] contact to Myriad worlds and penton's
[00:01:50] ownership switched hands several times
[00:01:52] why did these nameless choose to stay
[00:01:54] here how did the course of their
[00:01:56] subsequent lives Chad what do you think
[00:01:57] is going to happen first in the story no
[00:01:59] spoilers behind what do you think is
[00:02:00] going to happen first will we get himo
[00:02:03] or will she die hopefully she stay
[00:02:06] listen hopefully my next pull we get
[00:02:08] himo and she stays alive that's best
[00:02:11] case scenario they left the stars behind
[00:02:13] them their trailblaze would not be over
[00:02:16] that's also what the conductor thinks
[00:02:17] isn't
[00:02:18] it according to the passenger list the
[00:02:21] three people who got off were tiin leg
[00:02:23] work and Rosalina the Express's guard
[00:02:26] mechanic and surveyor respectively no
[00:02:29] one dies details are available yeah no
[00:02:31] no one dies in the story no then that
[00:02:33] would never happen
[00:02:35] occations and they don't even sound like
[00:02:37] they're real names either this will be
[00:02:40] like looking for a needle and a hay
[00:02:42] stack we'll just leave it to the stars
[00:02:45] of Fate considering the nameless
[00:02:49] diversity perhap we'll conclude
[00:02:51] navigation meeting on this point uh
[00:02:53] there's a bit of time left before we
[00:02:55] jump in the meantime might be a good
[00:02:57] idea to double check your bags sounds
[00:02:59] good he go pass an announcement before
[00:03:01] we jump still some time before to jump I
[00:03:04] should talk to everyone why should I

[00:09:59] came you want to come with arra but
[00:10:03] before you do I would make a request of
[00:10:06] you
[00:10:13] yeah you may think it's somewhat strange
[00:10:16] perhaps even rude but I wish to
[00:10:19] know have we met somewhere
[00:10:23] before wait a second Ryden yo yo yeah
[00:10:27] inauma we saved you remember there's
[00:10:28] like the puppet and we did the battle

[00:10:31] senora and then uh perhaps we
[00:10:36] have bra M donated $1 the just like you
[00:10:41] in terms of in the haze of my
[00:10:44] Recollections she stood shoulder toosh
[00:10:46] shoulder with me much like this surreal
[00:10:49] Dreamscape where we stood close yet
[00:10:52] forever Out Of
[00:10:54] Reach may I ask you a few more questions
[00:10:58] I
[00:10:59] tend to forget things which is why
[00:11:02] rather than memories she has a chain on
[00:11:05] her arm my emotions to capture what I
[00:11:07] normally wouldn't
[00:11:08] otherwise the answer is
[00:11:10] inconsequential your spontaneous
[00:11:12] reaction is what
[00:11:18] matters for instance when you awaken in
[00:11:21] your room your lips speak several names
[00:11:24] are they your
[00:11:26] companions family enemies
[00:11:30] you seem to have forged unbreakable
[00:11:33] bonds with many people and many
[00:11:36] incidents might I ask if you fear losing
[00:11:40] these bonds yo yo why are you talking in
[00:11:43] red
[00:11:44] uh if it would mean losing them I
[00:11:49] would I'm saying that to rizer up I'm
[00:11:51] like yeah I would never lose you baby
[00:11:53] girl then if there was a vast Dreamscape
[00:11:58] so liike it indistinguishable from
[00:12:01] reality there no one faces life's
[00:12:04] separations or deaths [ __ ] everyone
[00:12:07] attains their deserved happiness and
[00:12:09] lives joyfully ever
[00:12:12] after I would
[00:12:14] ask yes would you wish to stay yes yes
[00:12:17] yes yes I would wait does that mean here
[00:12:19] I would never allowed to live in a dream
[00:12:20] I would wait yes it's her it's with her
[00:12:22] right or is it alone
[00:12:25] yes
[00:12:28] now a imagine if this Splendid dream
[00:12:32] were faded to fall
[00:12:33] apart friends family
[00:12:37] strangers followed by the gentle breeze
[00:12:40] soaring Birds the stars and bad ending
[00:12:44] ultimately yourself I don't think your
[00:12:46] decisions matter in this game but I mean
[00:12:47] he
[00:12:49] hopefully everyone and every face they
[00:12:52] remember the joy and the heartaches the
[00:12:56] vows sealed and those left hanging
[00:12:59] all will inevitably March towards a
[00:13:02] predetermined
[00:13:04] ending if you had grasped the Journey's
[00:13:07] finale right from its
[00:13:09] Inception I would
[00:13:11] ask would you still embark on this
[00:13:14] journey wait wait wait let me reread
[00:13:16] that imagine if this spended
[00:13:18] dream all fall apart friends family
[00:13:20] strangers follow bit a gentle Bree
[00:13:22] everyone and every face they remember
[00:13:23] the joy and heartaches The Vow sealed
[00:13:25] and those left hanging all will
[00:13:26] inevitably March towards a predetermined
[00:13:27] ending if you had grasped the Journey's
[00:13:28] finale right from its Inception would
[00:13:30] you still go on
[00:13:32] it I would blaze a trail without
[00:13:35] hesitation I'm going to click on I would
[00:13:36] have
[00:13:37] [Applause]
[00:13:40] B I'm going to that one I'm that one cuz
[00:13:43] she's probably like oh you killed my
[00:13:44] friend in h guy third would you abandon
[00:13:46] it and then I'm like yeah I abandoned it
[00:13:47] and then she's like oh my God I love you
[00:13:49] don't have to be hard pressed to make a
[00:13:51] decision as I have said the answer is
[00:13:54] inconsequential okay see the choice
[00:13:55] doesn't matter hearing touch thought
[00:14:00] through these hi hello we're almost done
[00:14:02] I promise this isn't a quest stream okay
[00:14:05] it's slight SPO give me like 5 minutes
[00:14:08] and so we return to the original
[00:14:09] question okay what is it
[00:14:12] ask do you still remember
[00:14:15] me okay surely this matters I seem to
[00:14:18] remember you from
[00:14:25] somewhere I understand
[00:14:29] what how
[00:14:30] interesting for a split second it felt
[00:14:33] like countless versions of you yo yo is
[00:14:36] she breaking the fourth wall gave
[00:14:38] entirely different
[00:14:41] responses that was my final question
[00:14:43] thank you we all have our paths to walk
[00:14:48] so we shall bid our
[00:14:51] farewells we will meet
[00:14:55] again the Golden Dream is getting
[00:14:58] restless
[00:15:00] in the coming nights of long I'm afraid

[00:15:04] tribulations and witness many
[00:15:07] tragedies and
[00:15:09] finally your sight will only see black
[00:15:13] and
[00:15:14] white but please believe me that in that
[00:15:18] monochrome World there will be a glimpse
[00:15:21] of fleeting
[00:15:23] red and when you make a
[00:15:25] choice it will reappear before you once
[00:15:28] more

[00:27:11] majestic
[00:27:13] Metropolis what exactly oh chest o this
[00:27:16] chest looks sick that's a basic one
[00:27:19] oh our rooms are down this
[00:27:22] way this is a long
[00:27:25] hallway is it just me or is this still
[00:27:28] too big for its own
[00:27:31] good we're finally
[00:27:36] here well how about a drink first penone
[00:27:40] Soul glad is very
[00:27:43] famous go on do you remember the invite
[00:27:46] that the express received wait what's
[00:27:49] his neck tattoo the fam's esteemed
[00:27:52] guests are cordially invited to benone
[00:27:55] to participate in our Grand
[00:27:59] celebration that's why we're here you
[00:28:02] recall correctly but there was more to
[00:28:04] this
[00:28:06] invite wait really how do you know it
[00:28:08] says that what the [ __ ] the in the realm
[00:28:11] of Dreams find the legacy of the watch
[00:28:14] maker father of pentacon and thus the
[00:28:18] answer to the question why does life
[00:28:22] Slumber I don't remember that part of
[00:28:25] the invite this is the part that
[00:28:27] intrigues me the invite sent by the
[00:28:30] family was nothing more than a music box
[00:28:33] that when wound would play an A
[00:28:35] companying tune but the box that was
[00:28:38] sent to us was
[00:28:40] slightly
[00:28:42] unusual the music I recorded these
[00:28:45] dissonant notes and they were a perfect
[00:28:48] match with the gravity wave frequency
[00:28:50] when the Express made its warp jump also
[00:28:55] the express engine spatial curvature
[00:28:59] that was good give me
[00:29:00] one a distress call method regularly
[00:29:03] used by the
[00:29:05] nameless I can't be
[00:29:07] certain it may be a masked Fool's trap
[00:29:11] from the execution itself the Riddlers
[00:29:14] or Inquisition Spirits could have done
[00:29:17] the
[00:29:18] rers when did you discover this when we
[00:29:22] were handling that La Fu stellon matter
[00:29:25] I told pom pom about it first thing
[00:29:29] it's no wonder that IPC Ambassador also
[00:29:31] mentioned this watch maker the invite he
[00:29:34] received must also have contained a
[00:29:36] hidden message and it seems like he
[00:29:38] decoded
[00:29:40] it there's something else on my mind
[00:29:43] when the invite was brought up that
[00:29:45] family leader mentioned being one of the
[00:29:48] actual administrators of pentacon and
[00:29:51] that it was their duty to relieve us of
[00:29:53] any problems in hindsight there was more
[00:29:57] to that statement he also had Miss Robin
[00:30:00] with him I'm no singer but her voice
[00:30:03] sounded a little strange no would [ __ ]
[00:30:07] talk her voice s to the stage if their
[00:30:09] voice wasn't INX she's trying are you
[00:30:12] saying you suspect that the family did
[00:30:14] not send the invite and is hiding
[00:30:18] something from
[00:30:19] us she's just not that good at singing
[00:30:22] man it's fine the fact that the family
[00:30:24] sent out invites to the other factions
[00:30:27] is already unusual and your Discovery
[00:30:30] confirms that there could be a third
[00:30:32] party
[00:30:33] involved I take back what I said this
[00:30:36] event is becoming more interesting with
[00:30:40] each passing
[00:30:41] second why didn't you tell the others we
[00:30:44] shouldn't interfere if this is just an
[00:30:46] internal Affair of penacon or the
[00:30:50] family I'm actually not going to say but
[00:30:53] you said so yourself this could concern
[00:30:56] the trailblaze
[00:30:58] well I did which is
[00:31:01] why hey guys before we set off I told
[00:31:05] March 7th and G Hong about
[00:31:07] this so I was the only one kept in the
[00:31:11] dark then ain't no biggie when Galactic
[00:31:15] baseballer is in the house okay that's
[00:31:18] literally a war crime if you click this
[00:31:20] option your account should get deleted
[00:31:21] by the way it should just explode you
[00:31:24] restart bad ending situation is getting
[00:31:29] complicated who sent the
[00:31:31] invite what is the purpose of gathering
[00:31:34] all of the factions from to
[00:31:37] Penton and why does the family choose to
[00:31:40] remain silent about their knowledge of
[00:31:43] this there are too many unanswered
[00:31:45] questions we must use the oh there's too
[00:31:48] many unanswered
[00:31:50] questions right now let's just focus on
[00:31:53] the conductor's request we'll collect
[00:31:56] Intel while Eno in this wonderful
[00:31:59] vacation penone is after all a famed
[00:32:03] Resort of the cosmos sounds good sounds
[00:32:06] good stay alive F Co please and we'll do
[00:32:08] it return to your room and prepare to
[00:32:10] enter the dream we should probably enter
[00:32:11] the okay we should probably enter the
[00:32:13] dream I should probably talk to the
[00:32:16] rest a
[00:32:19] odd why is my room door open yo who's in
[00:32:22] my room bro I'm telling you I'm telling
[00:32:25] you this guy is the biggest [ __ ] boy in
[00:32:27] the
[00:32:28] world how
[00:32:31] fortuitous we meet again bro get out of
[00:32:35] is this your
[00:32:39] room calm down I'm just here to soak in
[00:32:42] the oh there a chest there Vibe this may
[00:32:45] be your room now but half a system hour
[00:32:49] ago it was still mine wait why is the
[00:32:52] door closed a lucky block number a lucky
[00:32:55] floor a lucky room number
[00:32:58] you have no idea how much I went through
[00:33:02] to book this precious
[00:33:04] space and now I've given it to
[00:33:07] you treasure it well friend you're the
[00:33:11] one who rang
[00:33:14] checking no no I only let you have my
[00:33:20] room why is the music so like Pon is a
[00:33:23] true blue land of dreams how many across
[00:33:27] the Stars
[00:33:28] their just to acquire an admission
[00:33:30] ticket into the reeree
[00:33:36] think about the type of people who can
[00:33:39] even afford to stay here if it wasn't
[00:33:42] for my brilliant plan you think the
[00:33:45] family would offend those big wigs just
[00:33:47] to saate the poultry whims of an
[00:33:49] unsought guest such as yourself yo yo yo
[00:33:53] so sit down and let's have a chat why
[00:33:56] are you talking to me like that done I
[00:33:58] think I deserve at least this much
[00:34:08] right cut to the sh watch your drink
[00:34:12] true I like that I don't trust him
[00:34:16] simply put my friend I need your help
[00:34:19] you may or may not know this but penone
[00:34:22] is far murkier than it
[00:34:24] seems the family's eyes are everywhere
[00:34:28] but you get the
[00:34:29] drift my goal is simple help the IPC
[00:34:34] retrieve some things that belong to them
[00:34:37] in the first place if you agree when
[00:34:40] this is done you will stand to reap
[00:34:44] great rewards
[00:34:48] as it's clear you're not just one of the
[00:34:51] crowd you possess a distinct quality so
[00:34:56] magnetic that it could way the outcome
[00:34:58] of any
[00:34:59] game that power you really don't wish to
[00:35:03] use it
[00:35:06] or you don't want to be rid of
[00:35:10] it why not use it to etch Your Name
[00:35:13] Across The
[00:35:14] Stars the power that men both fear and
[00:35:18] desire is right in the palms of your
[00:35:22] hands Miss ston have I hit the nail on

[00:40:44] little hot you have to admit right a
[00:40:46] blade must use it to cut
[00:40:48] eventually and when a gambler has
[00:40:50] nothing to lose on the table he will
[00:40:52] surely go For Broke and bet it all on a
[00:40:55] final hand

[00:45:02] otherwise don't worry doctor I have my
[00:45:06] ways the family fears interference from
[00:45:08] the IPC and their constant
[00:45:13] intervention or to play Devil's Advocate
[00:45:17] perhaps might have always been a ruse
[00:45:20] under the guise of the harmony if you
[00:45:22] ask me that invite is nothing but a
[00:45:25] self- planted diversion
[00:45:27] a red hering yeah fair
[00:45:31] or maybe they're thinking of pulling off
[00:45:34] something big during the Charmy festival
[00:45:38] or someone else made the invite and they
[00:45:41] acquest to elevating the magnitude of
[00:45:43] the
[00:45:45] plan well regardless be it the family or
[00:45:48] the watchmaker's Legacy as long as

[01:10:06] into reality there are different stories
[01:10:09] out there about the watchmaker's origin
[01:10:11] some said he was a traveling Merchant
[01:10:13] from Beyond the sky some claimed that he
[01:10:16] was exiled to pentacon as a prisoner and
[01:10:19] some speculate that he wasn't even a
[01:10:20] real person just a symbol the true story
[01:10:23] is anyone's guess but but everyone
[01:10:25] aspires to emulate his success and be

[01:13:31] Dreamscape and transformed it into the
[01:13:33] Glorious pentacon Grand Theater that's a
[01:13:35] little sus but okay since the moment it

[01:14:33] sod the gigantic soda bottle houses the
[01:14:36] headquarters of the Soul glad Enterprise
[01:14:39] Soul glad is said to have originated
[01:14:41] from a sweet medicinal syrup popular
[01:14:43] during the prison era invented by a man
[01:14:46] named
[01:14:47] Susa holy [ __ ] Chief Keef an
[01:14:51] Interstellar traveling Merchant saw the
[01:14:53] potential in the beverage and the
[01:14:55] formula I then carbonated the beverage
[01:14:58] and renamed It soul glad he also
[01:15:00] pioneered the school of thought known as
[01:15:02] sism in which he promoted the conception
[01:15:06] of Soul glad as a new kind of lifestyle
[01:15:08] and just like that he created a
[01:15:10] commercial Miracle did you know one of
[01:15:14] the ingredients in the original recipe

[01:54:11] other again so soon hey this is like the
[01:54:14] fourth time we see each other some would
[01:54:15] say it's Destiny others would say it's
[01:54:17] fate I haven't had a chance to properly
[01:54:18] introduce myself all the commotion just
[01:54:20] now I heard about bunch of mass fools
[01:54:23] were causing a ruckus on the streets I
[01:54:26] happened to be passing through got
[01:54:28] stopped for questioning and there were
[01:54:30] some
[01:54:32] misunderstandings along the
[01:54:34] way anyway I owe you another one is this
[01:54:38] lady your friend too yeah I'm pretty
[01:54:40] popular well we've only met each other
[01:54:42] once before but she is a kind soul for
[01:54:46] helping me at the hotel it's my pleasure
[01:54:48] to beautiful lady I I didn't mean to
[01:54:52] skip the beautiful lady part by the way
[01:54:55] what did you do to that man earlier it
[01:54:57] was like someone took him on an
[01:54:58] emotional roller coaster yeah avent's
[01:55:00] kind of yeah he's kind of insane I'm
[01:55:02] sorry it he's just like that I was
[01:55:03] wondering about that
[01:55:05] too what happened back there
[01:55:08] exactly oh never mind I thought she was
[01:55:11] asking about in the room okay never mind
[01:55:13] oh about the [ __ ] the dude uh talk
[01:55:15] therapy I use that on him what are you
[01:55:17] talking about it wasn't talk therapy it
[01:55:20] was Clockwork I don't think it's that
[01:55:23] simple could it have something to do
[01:55:25] with that uh Clocky that only you can
[01:55:27] see Clocky yes that cartoon character I
[01:55:32] think he's shown up in reality I mean in
[01:55:35] the Dreamscape I don't really know how a
[01:55:38] cartoon character could show up around
[01:55:40] here but according to our friend here
[01:55:43] only honest people with childlike
[01:55:45] innocence can see
[01:55:48] him it seems like I'm too old to qualify
[01:55:51] for that if Clocky really exists that
[01:55:54] can explain a lot of
[01:55:57] things huh can you see me too I can feel
[01:56:01] the presence of something inexplicable
[01:56:03] next to you but it's a shame that I
[01:56:06] can't communicate with him like you can
[01:56:08] we can both perceive these extraordinary
[01:56:11] things in the dream probably due to our
[01:56:13] ability to react to
[01:56:15] Memoria you're more attuned to it than I
[01:56:18] am I thought your heightened perception
[01:56:20] was caused by something the elegant me
[01:56:22] keeper might have left in your
[01:56:24] mind now it seems to me there are many
[01:56:27] more special beings like her in this
[01:56:30] dream who is she shortly after we parted
[01:56:33] again someone spying eyes on me I looked
[01:56:37] in the mirror and spotted A lady wearing
[01:56:39] a black veil we had a deep conversation
[01:56:42] but I won't bore you with the
[01:56:45] details it's a shame for her name I only
[01:56:49] know that she's from the garden of
[01:56:51] recollection Garden of

[02:09:15] together now we can go to the other side
[02:09:18] this is how the night Andale family
[02:09:20] repairs the dream SK
[02:09:22] fascinating isn't it we can use the
[02:09:24] building
[02:09:32] M okay now we
[02:09:35] cross it's like stepping on planks
[02:09:38] floating on
[02:09:39] water let's go that way we can get to
[02:09:42] the rooftop of the opposite Building
[02:09:44] from here but it requires a device I
[02:09:47] remember do I have to do this I guess I
[02:09:48] do who what the [ __ ] this is a guy the
[02:09:50] hell
[02:09:56] I probably should have read but I know
[02:09:57] how this works so uh this goes here this
[02:10:00] goes
[02:10:02] here how do you rotate click to rotate
[02:10:05] bam and it comes out just like that no
[02:10:08] matter how many times I've seen it it
[02:10:10] still looks magical what's over here
[02:10:13] let's
[02:10:14] go look that's the pentacon Grand
[02:10:18] Theater over there [ __ ] is this oh it r
[02:10:21] dazzling light I thought I was supposed
[02:10:23] to go to the right I thought this like a
[02:10:24] side glamorous dream how's that edgy I
[02:10:26] don't care enough to have this discourse
[02:10:28] I don't know if she is or isn't I don't
[02:10:29] care it's a fictional character but you
[02:10:31] can like her or not like her I don't

[02:10:35] evil characters like I want them to
[02:10:37] actually be evil if you're evil that's
[02:10:38] cool if you're like H I'm mean all right
[02:10:41] I suppose everyone who likes to bask in
[02:10:43] the light will be drawn to that kind of
[02:10:45] worm like countless fireflies chasing
[02:10:48] the
[02:10:49] fire let's go
[02:10:51] half the journey is still ahead of us
[02:10:53] yes ma'am whatever you say Firefly this
[02:10:55] one is a little bit
[02:10:57] complicated okay I have to put on my

[02:11:05] module I I know I'm supposed to interact
[02:11:07] with that but is there something here

[02:11:11] chest oh wait no I could just do this oh
[02:11:13] easy I didn't miss
[02:11:14] it

[02:15:11] Dreamland from time to time as the
[02:15:13] Charmy Festival is drawing
[02:15:17] close this spot is the closest place to
[02:15:20] the sky in the Dream
[02:15:22] escape it's far away from the hustle and
[02:15:25] bustle of the city and free from the
[02:15:27] bickering among the
[02:15:30] dreamers you can feel the
[02:15:33] moment the
[02:15:35] scenery the people and the
[02:15:38] dreams is someone singing without being
[02:15:41] disturbed by anyone this gives me honky
[02:15:43] Vibes is someone going to die is is she
[02:15:46] going to like tell me this
[02:15:48] is okay well
[02:15:51] how
[02:15:54] beautiful time I don't like this Frozen
[02:15:57] at this golden hour this Golden Dream
[02:16:01] shared by the fool from The Tavern and
[02:16:04] the memo keeper from the garden of
[02:16:07] recollection the wandering Ranger and
[02:16:09] the IPC Ambassador the astral Express
[02:16:14] nameless yo you want to go back to the
[02:16:17] ship I hear music right
[02:16:19] now last time I heard of a song like
[02:16:21] this someone died please let's go back
[02:16:25] to the
[02:16:26] ship
[02:16:27] yo everyone falls asleep here
[02:16:31] equally regardless of our different
[02:16:42] agendas I'm
[02:16:45] sorry I really am still
[02:16:48] away I know
[02:16:52] I I I never saw that
[02:16:55] coming I think it's only right to tell
[02:17:01] you yo Firefly the music's getting
[02:17:03] louder you want town was destroyed a
[02:17:05] long time
[02:17:09] ago it was probably the doing of the
[02:17:12] Legion or the Swarm
[02:17:15] [Music]
[02:17:18] but I'm an inter refugee
[02:17:22] just
[02:17:23] like many of The Penton locals stop the
[02:17:27] music harmony excepts
[02:17:29] everyone including Wanderers from
[02:17:32] afar family takes them in but they
[02:17:37] don't they don't belong
[02:17:40] here yo why is this city racist in this
[02:17:43] Splendid Metropolis some have a dream
[02:17:46] called pentacon
[02:17:49] but some have
[02:17:54] dreams that are no different from
[02:17:57] reality
[02:17:59] okay even though everyone who comes here
[02:18:01] Harbors the same motive in the
[02:18:05] beginning and it's likewise for
[02:18:08] me a wish I have a wish I want who
[02:18:11] achieve so badly in the real
[02:18:15] world but I
[02:18:17] can't was there a Five Star
[02:18:22] I want to give it a shot
[02:18:24] here
[02:18:26] okay I know the feel what's your
[02:18:33] wish entropy law
[02:18:36] Syndrome have you heard of this term
[02:18:39] it's a strange
[02:18:41] condition those suffering from it will
[02:18:44] experience an irreversible chronic
[02:18:46] dissociation of their physical
[02:18:49] structure yo
[02:18:51] this means they will slowly fade
[02:18:54] away and the process is barely
[02:18:57] noticeable to
[02:18:59] others
[02:19:01] okay you can still run jump and talk as
[02:19:07] usual everything seems
[02:19:12] normal but then you'll start doing
[02:19:15] everything slightly slower than others
[02:19:19] [Music]
[02:19:23] uhoh and then even slower than
[02:19:28] that until the lines between your body
[02:19:33] and the entire world become
[02:19:35] blurry y we can cure it we we'll find a
[02:19:38] way able to tell reality from dreams
[02:19:42] because they have all been shattered
[02:19:50] [Music]
[02:19:52] so how could I possibly resist
[02:19:55] it I mean can you
[02:19:58] imagine I can actually free myself from
[02:20:01] this icy medical cabin in this
[02:20:05] dream I can forget about all the
[02:20:08] doctor's advice I can listen and see and
[02:20:12] touch and think and understand whatever
[02:20:15] I want with my body
[02:20:21] so although this world isn't
[02:20:24] real this
[02:20:27] experience is priceless D just like this
[02:20:38] moment are they going to kiss oh never
[02:20:41] mind for certain reasons there are
[02:20:44] things I can't revealed to you
[02:20:48] yet but there are also things you should
[02:20:52] no I am in fact after the watchmaker's
[02:20:58] Legacy but that doesn't mean we have to
[02:21:00] go our separate ways and be
[02:21:03] enemies but at
[02:21:06] least I really hope things don't turn
[02:21:08] out that
[02:21:12] way yo these are so
[02:21:15] toxic who are you I hope so too
[02:21:24] [Music]
[02:21:25] thanks in my
[02:21:27] dream I saw a scorched Earth the [ __ ]
[02:21:32] bird sapling emerging from
[02:21:35] it it bloomed against the morning
[02:21:38] sun and it whispered to
[02:21:41] [Music]
[02:21:45] me I still remember the question on the
[02:21:48] invitation letter
[02:21:51] why does life
[02:21:53] Slumber you see everything is possible
[02:21:57] in this land of
[02:21:59] dreams the nightmarish past will

[02:28:46] nevering of the CLS
[02:28:55] Firefly once I Firefly there there's a

[02:29:22] reality I'm never wrong about the
[02:29:24] distinctive sense of Memoria that's in
[02:29:25] the air but this is very different from
[02:29:29] the sweet dream that I'm familiar
[02:29:31] with
[02:29:33] suffocating
[02:29:35] silent
[02:29:37] uneasy and these floating words can you
[02:29:40] see them
[02:29:41] too this kind of place would never exist

[02:46:03] kid back as promised you're all right we
[02:46:06] couldn't find you in either dream or
[02:46:08] reality we were worried sick it's good
[02:46:12] to see your
[02:46:13] unharmed allow me to introduce you to
[02:46:16] miss Black Swan memo of the garden of
[02:46:21] recollection you know each other yeah
[02:46:23] Miss heo said that they were
[02:46:25] investigating the incidents happening in
[02:46:27] the
[02:46:28] Dreamscape we've only met once but
[02:46:31] thanks to you we might be able to use
[02:46:34] this opportunity to get move your camera
[02:46:36] a little bit
[02:46:37] better so how did you end up actually no
[02:46:40] no horny what Li what you experien so
[02:46:44] the one who attacked you was a girl
[02:46:47] dressed in red a dep dead elusory arts
[02:46:51] and was able to
[02:46:53] shapeshift her name is Sparkle a masked
[02:46:56] fool who has infiltrated pentacon don't
[02:47:00] worry she won't be bothering you for now
[02:47:03] she's probably patting herself on the
[02:47:05] back for a job well done it seems you
[02:47:08] know her well of course I know everyone
[02:47:13] here on pentacon anyone could be lying
[02:47:17] but the remembrance does not
[02:47:19] lie so I feel the need to clarify with
[02:47:23] everyone Miss Sparkle's tricks can
[02:47:25] induce
[02:47:26] hallucinations but that strange
[02:47:29] Dreamscape nothing to do with her it
[02:47:32] originated from pentacon
[02:47:34] itself
[02:47:36] penone itself have you not sensed it yet
[02:47:40] this apparent land of dreams it's a
[02:47:43] carefully designed dream maintained by
[02:47:46] the family through unknown means
[02:47:49] and the memory Zone she fell into that's
[02:47:53] the true Dreamscape chaotic dangerous
[02:47:57] memory Zone meme a beast of memory
[02:48:00] dwells in the ever shifting
[02:48:04] Labyrinth she's right everyone do you
[02:48:08] all still remember your surroundings
[02:48:10] during your entry into the
[02:48:13] Dreamscape [ __ ] fish the deep sea huh so
[02:48:18] everyone saw the same
[02:48:20] thing I
[02:48:22] remember it was a
[02:48:25] room and then through a mirror the
[02:48:29] gallery of thoughts that's how the hotel
[02:48:32] staff referred to it have you
[02:48:35] noticed these Landscapes seem quite
[02:48:38] distinct from that of penacon in your
[02:48:41] dream yet strikingly
[02:48:45] s this Black
[02:48:47] Swan you're right
[02:48:49] right I didn't give it much thought at
[02:48:51] first but in hindsight the overlap is
[02:48:55] hard to
[02:48:56] ignore also after speaking to some of
[02:48:59] the frequenters the first stop when you
[02:49:02] enter the dream is supposed to be the
[02:49:04] hotel in the dream but due to certain
[02:49:07] incidents the hotel is now under
[02:49:10] renovation what could possibly have to
[02:49:13] happen to an entire building for it to
[02:49:15] require renovation that's a little sus
[02:49:18] that with what she just experienced and
[02:49:20] the answer is
[02:49:22] clear penac con's dream is sinking right
[02:49:25] now turning back to its original form
[02:49:28] and falling into the deep
[02:49:31] sea sinking you mean the Dreamscape is
[02:49:36] collapsing the encounter at the
[02:49:38] Dreamscape her eyes are literally like a
[02:49:40] [ __ ]
[02:49:41] Galaxy L [ __ ] color gradient that
[02:49:44] would explain the uneasiness we've
[02:49:46] sensed from the family leaving a IDE the
[02:49:49] question of guest safety were this to
[02:49:52] become public it would it would tarnish
[02:49:54] the name of the planet of
[02:49:57] festivities with the Charmy Festival
[02:49:59] around the corner it's no wonder they'd
[02:50:02] want to keep it under wraps even the
[02:50:04] guest safety cannot be assured Now isn't
[02:50:07] the monster that she encountered
[02:50:09] indisputable proof need I remind you
[02:50:12] that it is a memory Zone
[02:50:15] meme How could a meme that Harold's
[02:50:18] death and murder appear in a family
[02:50:21] proclaims to be absolutely safe everyone
[02:50:25] could be lying on penone does that
[02:50:28] include the family as
[02:50:30] well Miss Black Swan we fully understand
[02:50:34] our current predicament now going back
[02:50:36] to your original
[02:50:38] suggestion for what reason has the
[02:50:40] garden of recollection chosen to work
[02:50:42] with the astral
[02:50:44] Express H let me rephrase then this is
[02:50:49] my personal request not the garden of
[02:50:53] Recollections and the answer is simple
[02:50:57] Miss himo I simply wish to make an
[02:51:00] exchange related to the
[02:51:03] remembrance apart from my duty I also
[02:51:07] have some personal Pursuit and
[02:51:11] Aesthetics I am a memo keeper and a
[02:51:16] collector I too yearn to experience
[02:51:19] those luminous dazzling Cherished
[02:51:22] Memories that's simple enough to
[02:51:25] understand no as for you all nameless of
[02:51:30] the astral Express and practitioners of
[02:51:33] the
[02:51:34] trailblaze I have faith in your
[02:51:36] potential as well as in the unique
[02:51:40] Splendor you will unleash on the
[02:51:43] stage this is why I wish to befriend all
[02:51:47] of you
[02:51:50] a place where nightmares and sweet
[02:51:52] dreams
[02:51:54] intersect the perfect cradle for the
[02:52:00] remembrance I understand but before
[02:52:03] replying we must first discuss this
[02:52:05] among
[02:52:06] ourselves naturally take your
[02:52:13] time Chad if I click on her hand does it
[02:52:16] make us hold hands
[02:52:18] how do you see things heo it's best to
[02:52:21] be skeptical of her there's a
[02:52:23] significant amount of intentional
[02:52:25] misdirection in her words but I worry
[02:52:28] about the worst outcome if the
[02:52:30] Dreamscapes anomaly really exists and it
[02:52:33] isn't a natural
[02:52:35] occurrence but instigated by someone
[02:52:38] behind the scenes then it likely has
[02:52:40] something to do with the watchmaker's
[02:52:43] invite huh how'd you figure that one out
[02:52:47] well excluding any extreme scenarios The
[02:52:50] Mastermind responsible for these shifts
[02:52:53] in the Dreamscape undeniably stands
[02:52:55] against the family which BRS it down to
[02:52:58] two possibilities someone is drawing in
[02:53:01] external influences to distract and
[02:53:03] disrupt the family's control over panone
[02:53:06] either that or the family has been
[02:53:09] forced to seek outside Aid
[02:53:11] surreptitiously for
[02:53:13] self-preservation okay but from the
[02:53:15] encrypted message on the invite and the
[02:53:18] family
[02:53:19] reaction the former is more likely which
[02:53:22] also means that the one who sent out the
[02:53:24] encrypted nameless message and The
[02:53:27] Mastermind behind the anomaly are on the
[02:53:30] same side maybe even the same
[02:53:34] person well this doesn't necessarily
[02:53:37] mean a thing right in terms of methods
[02:53:40] both the fools and the Riddlers could
[02:53:42] pull it off hasn't the IPC cracked the
[02:53:45] message
[02:53:46] too March calm down down it's just a
[02:53:50] possibility but if this encrypted
[02:53:53] message isn't some harmless prank but
[02:53:56] done so to trailblaze into the fry we
[02:54:00] cannot remain
[02:54:02] uninvolved well let me tell you what I
[02:54:05] discovered and I'm sorry it's bad
[02:54:08] news according to reliable sources some
[02:54:12] people spotted a tall silver armored man
[02:54:14] on pentacon I've reached out to the
[02:54:16] blood hound family for news and visited
[02:54:18] many Sil armored man claim to have seen
[02:54:21] this
[02:54:22] Invader and this didn't we see him on
[02:54:24] the couch earlier I've sent it to you
[02:54:27] open it look at the start can you hear
[02:54:31] me
[02:54:32] aspr holy [ __ ] we got both gamers in the
[02:54:36] [ __ ] Quest Sparkle and then
[02:54:39] silverwolf it's it's that hacker
[02:54:42] girl I'll get straight to the point I
[02:54:45] know you've been investigating the
[02:54:47] abnormal why she so quiet
[02:54:50] the's
[02:54:55] louder cler you'll get to uncovering the
[02:54:58] truth about this soal beautiful dream
[02:55:03] the family is obviously hiding something
[02:55:07] [Music]
[02:55:10] right of of my heart I've decided to
[02:55:15] share it with all of you enter this
[02:55:18] string of code into your dream the
[02:55:21] device you used to dream with that's not
[02:55:23] my settings everyone else is loud listen
[02:55:25] to March when she talks also you
[02:55:29] already
[02:55:32] Sam
[02:55:33] [Music]
[02:55:35] AES fight Sam
[02:55:40] straight be overhelmed by his
[02:55:44] enthusiasm oh he had me relay
[02:55:48] to you at the have over theam said
[02:55:59] no I you luck fall
[02:56:02] [Music]
[02:56:05] behind those stellon Hunters they even
[02:56:08] factored penacon into their plan nowhere
[02:56:11] safe from them the situation is clear
[02:56:15] the planet of festivities isn't what it
[02:56:18] seems on the surface everyone's sites
[02:56:21] including the factions in the family are
[02:56:23] set on the
[02:56:25] watch every party has own Mo and they're
[02:56:28] attempting to thwart each other okay
[02:56:31] while we still don't know what this
[02:56:33] Legacy entails it's only a matter of
[02:56:35] time before the power struggle in snares
[02:56:38] innocent bystanders okay the molten
[02:56:40] Knight Sam is reportedly a remnant of
[02:56:42] cloth's iron Cavalry a genetically
[02:56:46] engineered Warrior he possesses
[02:56:48] superhuman perception and acts
[02:56:51] decisively he'll leave no margin for
[02:56:53] error this individual is every bit as
[02:56:57] dangerous as Kafka and Blade the random
[02:57:00] Kafka and blade mentions we love to see
[02:57:01] it a threat the hidden map that silver
[02:57:04] wol mentioned is probably the sealed
[02:57:06] Dreamscape hotel for the sake of what's
[02:57:08] to come a visit seems
[02:57:12] necessary which is why I didn't suggest
[02:57:15] it initially but the way things are now
[02:57:17] the Express has a reason to join the fry
[02:57:20] if the family asks just tell them that
[02:57:23] the express is investigating the stellon
[02:57:25] hunters I'm sure they'll understand
[02:57:28] we'll plan our next move according to
[02:57:30] how they react then we are in agreement
[02:57:33] let's return and inform Miss Black
[02:57:36] Swan
[02:57:38] cage hey Anderson it's been a long day
[02:57:41] man I'll take whatever you got let's see

[02:57:48] Miss Black Swan the express is willing
[02:57:51] to cooperate with you we need a proper
[02:57:54] guide to navigate the memory zone I'm at

[02:58:03] your own rooms enter the dream and if

[02:58:08] see one another at the Dreamscape

[02:58:13] world to ensure everyone's safety if
[02:58:15] needed I will also parlay with the
[02:58:17] family

[02:58:24] she literally save us I trust you
[02:58:26] friends I trust

[02:59:23] good friend to have he's definitely like
[02:59:25] he has bad motives but once you get past
[02:59:28] that you'd be homies with them you you

[02:59:34] and it's fine I'm not saying he's a like

[03:03:42] that Lobby the Navigator mentioned we'll

[03:04:51] other mysterious Tales I was curious as
[03:04:54] to who was spreading them and tested the
[03:04:56] method as described in the
[03:04:58] rumors to think I actually ended up
[03:05:01] here you aren't hiding anything are

[03:06:40] the memory zone is constantly shifting

[03:06:45] of a way to walk on the ceiling we're
[03:06:49] standing on the ceiling right now miss
[03:06:51] Aaron's words speak sense regardless we
[03:06:54] have to reach that flat surface hanging
[03:06:57] overhead I'll teach everyone some
[03:07:00] traversal tricks used in the memory Zone

[03:08:10] good emote we should be able to reach
[03:08:11] our destination with
[03:08:14] it but the memory Zone
[03:08:20] up ahead appears to be severely Twisted
[03:08:24] be careful
[03:08:31] everyone thank you AO 91 I told you it
[03:08:34] wasn't going to be that
[03:08:36] simple where is

[03:08:53] searching the room in an almost
[03:08:55] telepathic way even every nook and
[03:08:57] cranny outside the room this memory zone
[03:09:00] is overly Twisted I have to use an
[03:09:03] elegant methods so you two please give
[03:09:08] me a little
[03:09:10] time got
[03:09:13] it I can see the core of this Dreamscape
[03:09:16] and there are members of the family and
[03:09:20] some figures trying to find their way
[03:09:23] forward it appears that your friends
[03:09:26] aren't fairing too well Firefly one I
[03:09:29] think two

[03:09:38] way to the
[03:09:39] lobby wait it's The Girl Who was with
[03:09:45] you what's she doing here me but there
[03:09:48] is a known semblance in the memory Zone
[03:09:51] mirroring the essence she
[03:09:54] radiates what reason does she have to
[03:09:57] delve so deep into the Dreamscape she is
[03:10:01] she
[03:10:02] running no running
[03:10:06] away something's right behind her this
[03:10:09] is not good everyone it's sampo must

[03:10:15] first I have this puzzle to do give me a
[03:10:17] second there's no time I'll just have to
[03:10:19] break the rules and use some methods to
[03:10:21] help you phase through the memory Zone
[03:10:23] uh yeah one sec I'm doing a
[03:10:24] puzzle I picked up slivers of her
[03:10:27] thoughts in the memory Zone these will
[03:10:29] help you form an impression of her
[03:10:31] LeBron's Legacy now you must hang on to
[03:10:35] these thoughts with all your might and
[03:10:37] shape them in your

[03:11:25] emerging from it go home Firefly bloed
[03:11:28] against the morning sun blo and
[03:11:31] whispered to me why do people choose to
[03:11:35] sleep I
[03:11:38] think it's
[03:11:40] because they're afraid to awaken from
[03:11:43] the
[03:11:45] dream does she just not I want to wake
[03:11:47] up cuz she's like sick a dangerous sense
[03:11:50] guess nearby everyone be on your
[03:11:58] guard oh hey

[03:13:17] like if that was a real death black
[03:13:19] could have just saved us sh oh oh that
[03:13:20] monster I detected it cuz I'm the
[03:13:21] [ __ ] memo keeper I got you don't
[03:13:23] worry [ __ ] big ass
[03:13:36] head also if we didn't move out of the
[03:13:38] way we would have died not her right so
[03:13:40] we're kind of at
[03:13:42] fault don't worry I'm fine that was too
[03:13:44] sudden
[03:13:51] I'm really sorry but I have to leave for
[03:13:53] a short
[03:13:55] while death still hovers about and I
[03:13:59] must personally ensure Miss himiko and
[03:14:01] Miss March 7th's safety and warn fair I
[03:14:05] guess but I'll leave her to you Miss
[03:14:07] Aaron
[03:14:17] I'm sorry for what
[03:14:19] happened I was too focused on that girl
[03:14:23] and okay either this is a dream and it
[03:14:25] doesn't matter or it's real and they do
[03:14:27] not care that she died this one sentence
[03:14:29] is gone we we moved on this has to all
[03:14:32] right it's fine we're fine it's not
[03:14:33] we're not if you die in game you die in
[03:14:35] real life there's no way that's we're
[03:14:36] fine we're chill hesitation that caused
[03:14:37] her to lose her
[03:14:39] life okay never mind
[03:14:42] I it you didn't even draw your blade why
[03:14:50] M sorry
[03:14:54] I I had no
[03:15:01] choice I understand your anger and I
[03:15:04] will accept
[03:15:06] it but this isn't the
[03:15:08] time we should keep our eyes peeled and
[03:15:11] consider where the true enemies are
[03:15:13] hiding how to fight them [ __ ]
[03:15:15] they just killed our friend dictate your
[03:15:18] thoughts compose yourself and you will
[03:15:20] walk the right path once someone said to
[03:15:24] me no compassion for the enemy for that
[03:15:28] is cruelty upon
[03:15:30] yourself but you must See Clearly who
[03:15:33] the true enemy
[03:15:35] is and then with one swing of your
[03:15:39] blade you must understand its meaning
[03:15:42] and the price you
[03:15:44] pay this is the only advice I have for
[03:15:47] you from someone burdened with a blood
[03:15:55] debt I'm was that a quote that took like
[03:15:58] 5 Seconds himo has something to tell
[03:16:01] you there's good news and bad
[03:16:07] news memory bubbles signaling for you to
[03:16:09] press against your forehead you
[03:16:11] instructed a bu coldest piece of your
[03:16:12] body which then consolidates into clear
[03:16:14] image you and himo March 7th look
[03:16:18] black was unnoticed by the family I
[03:16:21] understand the situation now please take
[03:16:24] her and Retreat to a safe location if
[03:16:26] time allows you can investigate
[03:16:28] fireflies matter first meet later at
[03:16:31] Clocky
[03:16:33] statue May reason the ball which is why
[03:16:36] I must undertake Miss himiko's request
[03:16:39] and bring both of you back to
[03:16:42] reality I'm glad to see that you're fine
[03:16:46] let us reach a safe place before
[03:16:48] speaking again than b Phoenix Miss Black
[03:16:51] Swan do you not intend to open some sort
[03:16:53] of
[03:16:55] teleporter I don't recommend that her
[03:16:59] mental state is unstable so we have to
[03:17:03] avoid any rough traversal methods like
[03:17:06] just
[03:17:07] now also while we're departing we can
[03:17:10] still do more for Miss Firefly can't
[03:17:14] we some remnants of her Pres pres linger
[03:17:18] nearby seize the chance to Edge them
[03:17:21] into your remembrance holy [ __ ] fall
[03:17:23] Master if we can start investigating on
[03:17:26] the way that would be good let's go we
[03:17:29] have to find another path sorry but
[03:17:32] could you give me a few more minutes I
[03:17:36] um have some unfinished
[03:17:41] business you watch a as Aron turns away
[03:17:44] you remember that it was there that
[03:17:48] that it was there that she dissolved
[03:17:50] into a mere illusion you see her paw
[03:17:52] lips pursed eyes downcast after a moment
[03:17:55] she hunches down as if Gathering
[03:17:57] something with her hands and arises
[03:17:59] again May death be the end of your
[03:18:02] boundless
[03:18:03] dream guing you back to the waking
[03:18:07] [Music]
[03:18:11] world let's
[03:18:12] [Music]
[03:18:14] go man [ __ ] you
[03:18:18] okay she's actually dead okay all
[03:18:21] right I hate this game what is this
[03:18:34] [Music]
[03:18:40] [Music]
[03:19:11] okay no one's here what's going on why
[03:19:14] is it getting hot in the
[03:19:20] mamoria these are all charred remains
[03:19:24] they're still smoldering the culprit
[03:19:27] can't have gotten far I suppose we can
[03:19:29] slow down for now
[03:19:31] then shut up
[03:19:34] S looks like this monster was slain by a
[03:19:36] thermic
[03:19:38] weapon
[03:19:43] okay looks like this monster died of a
[03:19:45] hyperthermic
[03:19:57] reaction something's off these traces
[03:20:00] are fresh someone just left the
[03:20:04] scene would this person have anything to
[03:20:06] do with what's happened just now I
[03:20:08] cannot reach a conclusion with so few
[03:20:10] Clues just listen to your gut you were
[03:20:14] the one who said that the Rance doesn't
[03:20:17] lie from of these carcasses that person
[03:20:21] was tall and much stronger than an adult
[03:20:24] male the method was clean and crisp Sam
[03:20:28] no strike kills I mean it could be a
[03:20:30] monster too a mercenary or an assassin
[03:20:34] he entered through the door from the
[03:20:35] lobby and went farther into the
[03:20:38] hotel if that's the case he should have
[03:20:40] seen everything that happened here I
[03:20:43] take back what I said we have to hurry
[03:20:45] to that memory Zone where Miss Firefly's
[03:20:47] presence was imprinted considering what
[03:20:49] this person can do if his goal is that
[03:20:52] place as well there won't be anything
[03:20:53] left there you chew this way I'll try to
[03:20:57] create our music's already loud why you
[03:20:59] sp like the music's literally loud it's
[03:21:00] just it's ambient music now so they
[03:21:02] wouldn't make it

[03:21:32] below going to teach me to phas through
[03:21:34] the walls now you two may not be able to
[03:21:37] phase through physical structures like
[03:21:38] memo Keepers but I've got a great idea
[03:21:42] that will help you save FL right below
[03:21:44] this room it's really easy see this
[03:21:48] chandelier next we want to create some
[03:21:51] reasonably small movements still
[03:21:54] remember what I taught you feel the flow
[03:21:57] of the Memoria walk up the wall and then
[03:22:02] get close to
[03:22:03] it can you play Fireflies now

[03:26:46] I'm down let me get this book
[03:26:49] first are you ready no no no there's a
[03:26:52] bird I saw the bird there's little Le
[03:26:56] Firefly the bird it's what this room
[03:26:59] left behind the memories of
[03:27:02] her the slight trembling of I hate this
[03:27:05] they kill a character then they're like
[03:27:06] Wow Let's go through all the memories
[03:27:08] with her the flow of
[03:27:10] Memoria I gathered and reproduced them
[03:27:13] in
[03:27:14] fragments as for the con
[03:27:16] text we'll need to sort that out a bit
[03:27:19] fine she's still fine she's not dead
[03:27:20] she's still fine she's still fine Rec
[03:27:21] Crea memories on this scale takes quite
[03:27:23] a toll on
[03:27:26] me for that thing I encountered with my
[03:27:30] Trailblazer friend back then if I'm not
[03:27:33] wrong it has to do with the watch maker
[03:27:36] she
[03:27:37] mentioned your
[03:27:39] name thinking of you even in your
[03:27:42] absence seems like you two were pretty
[03:27:44] close bro we met we met like 5 hours ago
[03:27:47] seems to be sharing her Discovery with
[03:27:49] someone and it's related to the watch
[03:27:52] maker okay I don't know if this is going
[03:27:54] to be like oh it was just a dream or if
[03:27:56] she's actually dead if she's actually
[03:27:57] dead I think they should have introduced
[03:27:58] her and then killed her off in like two
[03:28:00] quests I feel like if you're going to
[03:28:01] introduce a character and make us like
[03:28:03] them don't kill them off right away like
[03:28:04] let us like them more and then kill them
[03:28:06] off anyways she has no idea that she'll
[03:28:09] become a victim
[03:28:14] ohare why did you
[03:28:16] this isn't what we agreed on wait who
[03:28:20] you yo yo who are you yelling atation
[03:28:21] has changed and it seems that
[03:28:24] companion has deviated from the original
[03:28:27] plan perhaps judging from the outcome
[03:28:31] this is that person's true hey who
[03:28:33] betrayed her I swear to God if it's one
[03:28:35] of the family [ __ ] who forced her to go
[03:28:38] that way Mecca what an intriguing
[03:28:42] statement I recall the blood hound
[03:28:45] family is pursuing a criminal a tall
[03:28:50] male no but Sam wouldn't be in a [ __ ]
[03:28:53] dream with her the door it w open based
[03:28:57] on these fragmented pieces of
[03:28:59] information it seems fireflies companion
[03:29:02] betrayed her that guy stream valerant
[03:29:04] and trapped her alone in this room
[03:29:06] disappearing Without a Trace she
[03:29:08] mentioned that this transaction involves
[03:29:10] the watch maker and that often means
[03:29:13] stepping on many people's toes
[03:29:16] they might have had their eyes on the
[03:29:18] Legacy or wanted to silence another Who
[03:29:21] Knew Too Much or there could be a deeper
[03:29:24] secret tucked away in this memory
[03:29:26] Zone and to hook that elusive prize one
[03:29:30] needs the right bait so a masturbator
[03:29:34] you
[03:29:35] mean
[03:29:37] Firefly this is just the worst case
[03:29:41] scenario but think about it if the
[03:29:44] Mastermind behind all this is nearby why

[03:29:49] freely
[03:29:53] unless there's something else he cares
[03:29:56] more about and
[03:29:57] means or should I say is
[03:30:01] verifying she had no other way to leave
[03:30:04] but from the side

[03:39:10] talks like a [ __ ]
[03:39:11] sociopath my friend let's be honest that
[03:39:15] woman named
[03:39:18] acaron isn't as simple as you thought
[03:39:22] did she say she's a galaxy
[03:39:25] ranger she's actually an
[03:39:28] emanator who brings death and
[03:39:36] finality no way bro she literally could
[03:39:39] have saved Firefly by just jumping
[03:39:52] acuron did nothing wrong [ __ ]
[03:39:53] she could have literally jumped and got
[03:39:55] her this is the
[03:39:58] truth let me give you some IPC Insider
[03:40:01] information my friend it's not like
[03:40:03] there okay look I know my says me my
[03:40:06] reaction time sucks but there's a big
[03:40:08] purple [ __ ] forming then it appeared
[03:40:11] then it struck it's not like it was like
[03:40:12] a fast oh [ __ ] what where did Firefly it
[03:40:14] was literally like a whole process main
[03:40:17] character dodg it and we're slow as [ __ ]
[03:40:18] we dodged it we're on path of
[03:40:20] preservation we press e we taunt all
[03:40:22] right all good let me give you some
[03:40:23] insided information do you know Duke
[03:40:24] Inferno I do I fought him before did
[03:40:28] I nicely done as
[03:40:32] expected I'll cut to the chase
[03:40:36] then this Duke Inferno is a fire demon
[03:40:40] from fetor he's an energy life form and
[03:40:43] it's rumored that his birth is related
[03:40:45] to a certain
[03:40:48] genius he and his thugs formed everflame
[03:40:53] mansion and viewed nuk as their
[03:40:57] savior in actuality they were led by
[03:41:00] this Chad does n look like me
[03:41:03] burning practicing the will of didn't do
[03:41:06] dror ratio Quest no I didn't and even
[03:41:08] the other Annihilation gangs weren't
[03:41:11] spared I'm not sure what the family was
[03:41:13] thinking or perhaps someone was scheming
[03:41:16] behind the
[03:41:18] scenes but shockingly these characters
[03:41:22] received an
[03:41:24] invitation and why would the everflame
[03:41:26] Mansion
[03:41:28] decline they Harbor Fierce intentions
[03:41:32] swearing to turn the planet of
[03:41:34] festivities into a sea of Blazing
[03:41:40] Flames but there's no need to
[03:41:43] worry they won't be able to to attend do
[03:41:46] you know
[03:41:50] why because iFit is
[03:41:55] dead what
[03:41:59] happened they were eliminated on their
[03:42:02] way the asent demonstrating remarkable
[03:42:06] exp minus one character ended if and
[03:42:09] swiped the invitation that the
[03:42:11] annihilation gang had in their
[03:42:13] possession the ever flame Mansion
[03:42:16] disbanded each
[03:42:22] going yeah okay join their separate
[03:42:26] ways thereafter a mysterious galaxy
[03:42:30] ranger arrived on panon checking into
[03:42:33] the hotel with only amus I mean yeah he
[03:42:35] could be lying but do you still need me
[03:42:38] to continue the story my friend it was
[03:42:41] acon doesn't roll out to others do you
[03:42:43] have any other evidence
[03:42:46] the Galaxy Rangers come and go like
[03:42:48] shadows and there's little communication
[03:42:50] between
[03:42:51] them you her story is almost too
[03:42:55] perfect she remains silent there's no
[03:42:59] concrete evidence against her while the
[03:43:02] IPC can investigate it'll take some
[03:43:06] time so my
[03:43:10] friend the choice is yours now you can
[03:43:14] leave this place immed immediately
[03:43:16] without looking back and forever forsake
[03:43:20] the chance to get closer to the truth I
[03:43:23] don't like the way you talk to me or you
[03:43:25] can accept my invitation and learn a
[03:43:28] truth a truth potent enough to upend
[03:43:31] everything in
[03:43:33] pentacon I need your help so I'll wait
[03:43:37] but not for
[03:43:39] long once you are ready Follow Me Wait
[03:43:43] does the choice actually matter here see
[03:43:45] the truth first then
[03:43:47] decide you'll still have
[03:43:50] time acaron is the emanator of a
[03:43:53] particular Eon but he gave me a
[03:43:57] choice maybe I should talk to Black Swan
[03:44:00] again this ain't balder's gate L
[03:44:05] bro my my you look like a small injured
[03:44:09] animal are you still willing to talk to
[03:44:12] me of course I'm still willing willing
[03:44:15] to be your
[03:44:21] psychotherapist I admit I made a
[03:44:23] transaction with that gentleman to bring
[03:44:25] you before him he needs you it's
[03:44:28] essential if we want to reclaim panone
[03:44:31] recognizing his immense potential and
[03:44:33] the invaluable memories he can help me
[03:44:36] gather I opted to join forces with
[03:44:40] him in paniconi everyone may be lying
[03:44:45] yes I don't like a venturine guy talks
[03:44:46] like a sociopath with an addiction to
[03:44:48] winning yeah that's entirely true
[03:44:50] entirely however he is
[03:44:53] pretty but do you still remember I said
[03:44:57] I have faith in your potential and
[03:45:00] that's not a lie The Garden of
[03:45:03] recollection wants to witness the future
[03:45:05] of the astral Express trailblazing the
[03:45:08] cosmos and as for these memories I will
[03:45:12] treasure them I do not have reasons to
[03:45:15] hurt any of you instead I will continue
[03:45:18] how often did they get away with being
[03:45:19] pretty [ __ ] the first thing we
[03:45:22] saw about Ron May is her literally
[03:45:24] drugging us and everyone was still sing
[03:45:27] Look I still love her do what you want
[03:45:28] CFA you can commit crimes it's fine but
[03:45:31] I'm just saying you can't be like oh oh
[03:45:33] pretty privil it is what it is pretty
[03:45:35] privilege is a thing can you TR can I
[03:45:37] trust adventurine my take on this might
[03:45:40] surprise you oh black swans take in my
[03:45:43] view he's a trustworthy in individual
[03:45:46] not for any other reason but because
[03:45:47] he's an exceptional businessman in this
[03:45:51] vast Universe no one values honesty in
[03:45:53] contract contract Jeong
[03:45:56] Lee but always be on guard particularly
[03:46:01] when making agreements with him
[03:46:03] scrutinize the
[03:46:05] details beyond the confines of the
[03:46:08] contract your rights are off his radar
[03:46:11] he'll go to extreme lengths to ensure
[03:46:15] his Advantage who do you think is the
[03:46:16] Mastermind I still believe that Miss
[03:46:18] Firefly
[03:46:19] situation is deeply connected with the
[03:46:22] Stellar on Hunter just as we speculated
[03:46:25] but as you've heard aventurine has his
[03:46:27] finger pointed Ryden would never betray
[03:46:29] me I can't fathom why he draw that
[03:46:32] conclusion but given his access to the
[03:46:34] ipc's intelligence Network we should
[03:46:36] seriously she's going to be like oh my
[03:46:37] god look this is going to be okay this
[03:46:39] is going to be like the big plot twist
[03:46:40] she's like oh my God I had no choice I
[03:46:43] had to deliver death onto him it was my
[03:46:45] duty and then like oh I forgive you and
[03:46:47] then there be red text
[03:46:50] abore it was
[03:46:56] unexpected that's why during this golden
[03:47:00] Suare but you
[03:47:03] know all right are you willing to bring
[03:47:05] me out of the memory zone of course but
[03:47:08] now is not the time I know you're
[03:47:11] confused and sad
[03:47:15] whoever that girl might have been you

[03:52:12] pitch I know
[03:52:17] brother you seem to be in low Spirit

[03:52:32] them perhaps someone was behind it I'm
[03:52:35] sorry I forgot you just came back you

[03:52:51] death to all

[04:00:14] the companions after a thorough
[04:00:16] discussion the crew decides to assist
[04:00:17] pentony leading to the revelation of a
[04:00:19] conspiracy orchestrated by the IPC it's
[04:00:22] just text what a [ __ ] ending oh my God
[04:00:24] imagine choosing this [ __ ] ending
[04:00:26] anyways with the expulsion of all ill
[04:00:28] intented visitors the Charmy Festival
[04:00:31] proceeds smoothly as honored guests you
[04:00:33] partake in the joyous atmosphere filled
[04:00:34] with laughter clinging glasses full of
[04:00:36] Soul glad this been singing the
[04:00:38] [Music]
[04:00:39] crowd may this moment last forever and
[04:00:42] may we never awaken from this euphoric
[04:00:43] dream
[04:00:44] [Music]
[04:00:46] what okay this is actually bad ending
[04:00:48] this is actually bad ending this says
[04:00:51] you [ __ ] up Sparkle
[04:00:55] Sparkle at least she's real look at
[04:00:57] least she's
[04:00:58] [Music]
[04:01:03] real Elio wait a second I know that guy
[04:01:07] wait a second okay you can go back oh
[04:01:10] okay then I guess it would have made
[04:01:12] sense to do it and then go back but
[04:01:14] it closes your game it's a joke ending
[04:01:17] wait is this bait I mean I guess it's
[04:01:19] not hard
[04:01:22] [Music]
[04:01:27] to I
[04:01:30] [Music]
[04:01:35] know yeah it's probably just the Easter
[04:01:37] egg you do it you're like oh you [ __ ]
[04:01:38] up and then you reset it deletes your
[04:01:41] account what did you rate the story I
[04:01:43] think it was really good I mean I'm
[04:01:44] curious to see how they follow up on it
[04:01:45] but I liked it a lot uh recency bias I
[04:01:48] know but it was definitely my favorite
[04:01:50] one so far left this on a huge
[04:01:52] Cliffhanger yeah [ __ ] them for that the
[04:01:54] first planet wasn't bad too I like it so
[04:01:56] far but penin is also aesthetically my
[04:01:57] favorite like the whole dream [ __ ] I
[04:01:59] think is cooler than seven times cooler
[04:02:01] than everything else but that's just the
[04:02:02] type of stuff I like so I'm already
[04:02:04] biased a little rushed yeah the only
[04:02:06] thing I think I don't know Firefly is
[04:02:08] actually dead I assume she is cuz we're
[04:02:09] getting all this [ __ ] [ __ ] there's no
[04:02:11] way she comes back uh Elicia moment
[04:02:13] sorry but I feel like if she act like be
[04:02:16] like assuming she is I wish we like it's
[04:02:18] weird to like meet her and then have
[04:02:20] memories with her and then she dies like
[04:02:22] I feel like yeah I feel like it could
[04:02:23] have been spread out a little bit longer
[04:02:25] pacing wise font sumaru pedag I still
[04:02:28] like sumaru a lot I don't know if I like
[04:02:29] Fontana or sumaru better I feel like
[04:02:31] everyone's going to say Fontan cuz it's
[04:02:32] more recent and I I don't even remember
[04:02:33] half the [ __ ] that happened sumaru cuz
[04:02:34] of the memory of a goldfish but I
[04:02:36] remember liking it a lot but Fontana is
[04:02:37] really good yeah suu Act 2 was insane I
[04:02:41] also I think Carrie bear was like my
[04:02:42] favorite or one of my favorite gen
[04:02:44] 99% Firefly ain't dead Sparkle was sus
[04:02:46] of her the whole time yeah I think but
[04:02:48] like okay here's the thing if she's not
[04:02:50] dead like Robin's not dead sure but like
[04:02:52] I feel like if Firefly is not dead why
[04:02:54] would they give us this whole thing cuz
[04:02:56] think about it let's say you play the
[04:02:57] game in a year right you're not going to
[04:02:58] have to wait for the next patch so you
[04:03:00] could do all of this and then you just
[04:03:02] keep going and she's back maybe like
[04:03:04] hopefully you know but I feel like it
[04:03:07] would be really jabate yeah maybe it's
[04:03:09] some like dream [ __ ] like colle you know
[04:03:11] we cured her yeah that could be fair
[04:03:13] there maybe she's like don't believe
[04:03:15] your eye you would not oh pentag is you
[04:03:18] would not believe your eyes and
[04:03:21] fireflies oh my God I figured it
[04:03:26] out it makes
[04:03:31] [Music]
[04:03:34] sense oh my
[04:03:36] God it all makes sense

[04:04:11] like I know about Sam like I got that

[04:04:17] my brother in Christ it is 300 a.m. I
[04:04:21] haven't started this Quest and this
[04:04:22] Quest lasts 5 and 1 half to 6 hours that
[04:04:25] means I end at like 9:00 a.m. it is
[04:04:27] literally tomorrow today I'm launching

[04:04:34] you not started the story no no we
[04:04:35] finished the like we literally killed
[04:04:36] the meme but now it's this
[04:04:38] part okay 2.1 a friend my exp are much
[04:04:43] better than than yours when I first saw
[04:04:44] this technically we're doing this Quest
[04:04:47] on patch day so like we're technically
[04:04:49] all time your eyes aren't deceiving you
[04:04:52] it's
[04:04:53] her the famous singer oh also recap of
[04:04:56] what we saw before this started [ __ ]
[04:04:58] the Firefly incident meme just pulled
[04:05:00] through and also Robin randomly [ __ ]
[04:05:03] Deed or is she I don't have a soundboard
[04:05:06] or I would okay but how is that possible
[04:05:09] how is that Robin
[04:05:15] well first of all can I just say that
[04:05:17] this had nothing to do with me I'm just
[04:05:20] an unlucky bystander here the family can
[04:05:23] testify for me if you don't believe me
[04:05:26] just ask anyone in the BL I don't trust
[04:05:28] the family they hate me and they hate
[04:05:30] the IPC I don't even trust Misha so
[04:05:32] they'd never
[04:05:35] lie this is not where the crime happened
[04:05:38] what I showed you was a memory the most
[04:05:41] basic light cone manting Tech authorized
[04:05:44] by The Garden of recollection and owned
[04:05:46] by the
[04:05:49] IPC did you really think the galaxy
[04:05:51] ranger was an outsider this whole
[04:05:56] time paniconi has made a solemn
[04:05:59] commitment to protect the safety of
[04:06:01] anyone inside a family dream any person
[04:06:03] in distress will be forcibly awakened
[04:06:06] and safely returned to
[04:06:08] reality okay protect the safety of
[04:06:10] anyone gives them the confidence to make
[04:06:12] such conclusive statement
[04:06:14] because behind this promise is the
[04:06:17] harmony the family's dream wavers link
[04:06:20] up their minds together to construct an
[04:06:22] unbreakable defensive
[04:06:25] line breaking through this line of
[04:06:27] defense to create death in the
[04:06:31] Dreamscape not even a memoe keeper could
[04:06:34] do that without the family's permission
[04:06:37] okay who could have done it friend the
[04:06:40] only one is her the girl who calls
[04:06:44] herself a galaxy
[04:06:46] ranger an impostor impostor unsought
[04:06:49] guest sorry an emanator who hides her
[04:06:53] true identity
[04:06:56] acaron we've played other games bro we
[04:06:58] know she's riding
[04:07:00] conclusion and
[04:07:02] Robin her Misfortune was staring right
[04:07:05] at
[04:07:07] her who will be the next to die that
[04:07:10] really is hard to take in
[04:07:16] Chad I just launched launched fine AFK
[04:07:18] Journey on my phone building trust
[04:07:21] always takes time and I'm willing to
[04:07:23] wait I just hope you realize that that
[04:07:26] Legacy is
[04:07:28] concerned CT plans are already underway
[04:07:31] throughout
[04:07:32] paniconi everyone's got their own
[04:07:35] agenda careful you don't get stuck on
[04:07:38] the wrong
[04:07:39] side if I were you I'd keep my distance
[04:07:42] from acaron
[04:07:44] after all any schemes out in the open
[04:07:47] are always going to be better than a
[04:07:49] monster Monster In the Shadows right she
[04:07:52] is a monster in the shadows who's to say
[04:07:55] there isn't an even deeper conspiracy
[04:07:57] lurking beneath the
[04:08:01] surface hello boxan memo keeper I think
[04:08:05] our little deal is
[04:08:09] finished aventurine is telling the truth
[04:08:13] this memory is a real one and there's no
[04:08:16] sign of any Distortion grafting on if I
[04:08:19] click on her hand it's like we're
[04:08:20] holding hands you see is not the garden
[04:08:23] I'm there are real limits to what they
[04:08:24] can actually do okay but you know all
[04:08:28] this friend let's not beat around the
[04:08:31] bush here the thing is I want to reach
[04:08:33] out personally to team upks
[04:08:36] for team up with the astral Express I
[04:08:40] told you I'm just not interested in
[04:08:41] scrambling for the Legacy
[04:08:44] I you know I like you adventuring but I
[04:08:46] don't know if I trust you like
[04:08:48] that I'm going keep it realat my
[04:08:52] drift I'm talking ownership of this
[04:08:54] Frontier prison oh also I heard the line
[04:08:57] where he was like doctor you're so big I
[04:09:00] heard that line I actually heard it
[04:09:01] that's like one of the only other things
[04:09:02] I heard this has all become a bad debt
[04:09:04] thanks to the cancer of all on he
[04:09:06] literally says that you'll see you'll
[04:09:07] see see IPC has tried sitting down for
[04:09:10] negotiations time and again but the
[04:09:12] family wouldn't hug our calls okay you
[04:09:16] have no idea how difficult these people
[04:09:18] are to deal with put it this way they've
[04:09:22] hushed up the existence of death before
[04:09:25] okay so they can definitely cover up any
[04:09:27] news about Robin's what if Robin's not
[04:09:29] actually dead and it was all a dream
[04:09:31] just quietly Flo and then we wake up
[04:09:33] bubble and pop pop nobody ever being the
[04:09:38] wiser that's not fair right so then
[04:09:42] friend I need your
[04:09:45] help I can't trust
[04:09:48] you I have but only one goal the
[04:09:52] family's front door is like a high wall
[04:09:55] and to tear the whole thing down I'll
[04:09:56] have to dig out a few chunks
[04:09:58] First Once I find a weak point the IPC
[04:10:02] will have plenty of means [ __ ] it I
[04:10:04] trust you now we a chance so long as we
[04:10:08] can get to the truth behind her death we
[04:10:09] can have Justice for
[04:10:12] Robin also let me m
[04:10:15] alerts Casta I appreciate you think so
[04:10:17] Prime guys I have a theory do you think
[04:10:18] they put words in bold in this game cuz
[04:10:21] there's no Pon to like reread the
[04:10:22] important part to idiots like they make
[04:10:24] genin idiot proof by having Pon repeat
[04:10:26] the important [ __ ] to you here do they
[04:10:27] just bolded they're like listen here
[04:10:29] dumbass get to the truth behind her
[04:10:31] death truly a once in a blue moon
[04:10:35] opportunity I've been investigating and
[04:10:37] making lots of friends all over panone
[04:10:40] precisely for this very moment okay
[04:10:44] this tragic news would be extremely bad
[04:10:46] for the family this guy's a sociopath
[04:10:48] that's the vi I'm getting stop it
[04:10:50] leaking especially to the IPC but I
[04:10:52] trust them with my life I trust that
[04:10:54] there are still a few factions that
[04:10:56] remain
[04:10:57] exceptions and that's why I need you
[04:11:00] all the reputation of the astral Express
[04:11:03] precedes you the harmony will give you
[04:11:06] the fairest of appraisals or like a I
[04:11:08] don't know what the word is like like a
[04:11:10] really what happen you like use people
[04:11:13] and I get to put it toward completing my
[04:11:15] mission for the IPC it's what you call a
[04:11:19] win-win
[04:11:20] situation okay do you want to take
[04:11:22] advantage of the family's trust in us
[04:11:24] don't worry just head back and talk
[04:11:26] things over with your companions that
[04:11:28] Navigator is really smart she must
[04:11:31] understand the value of this deal look
[04:11:35] here's my contact details if you come to
[04:11:37] any conclusions call me hey you don't
[04:11:41] have to tell me twice take this a
[04:11:43] thorough investigation can always use a
[04:11:45] little more funding and he gave us money
[04:11:49] this guy's actually [ __ ] child too I
[04:11:51] really am looking forward to uncovering
[04:11:53] the truth about death with
[04:11:56] everyone cool got [ __ ] money just
[04:11:59] sauntered off he really doesn't mean to
[04:12:02] force it but something still seems off
[04:12:06] what now what are your
[04:12:09] plans oh she's still here what is she
[04:12:12] thinking
[04:12:16] the [ __ ] I just got 50k credits wait he
[04:12:19] actually just gave us
[04:12:21] money on the surface this doesn't look
[04:12:23] like a bad deal for you but a venturine
[04:12:27] is a shrewd Merchant whose scheme won't
[04:12:30] just be as simple as it appears to be he
[04:12:33] doesn't know about Miss Firefly yet but
[04:12:36] judging by your reaction he may have
[04:12:38] noticed something going on and
[04:12:41] deliberately shifted topics to the true
[04:12:43] truth of death to try and pull you in L
[04:12:46] okay didn't notice doesn't know about
[04:12:48] Firefly that's quick thinking and very
[04:12:51] Sound Logic aventurine is no fool and
[04:12:55] working with him definitely has its
[04:12:58] whatever you say queen can I toss the
[04:13:00] die and let it decide bring it up to
[04:13:01] fate it's just how that Gambler
[04:13:05] thinks okay I didn't know my decision
[04:13:07] mattered I'm sorry anyway be careful out
[04:13:09] there my fault there's more than one way
[04:13:11] to blaze a trail Blaze is a trail in a
[04:13:14] dark Forest beset by Wolves ensuring
[04:13:17] your own escape to safety should be your
[04:13:19] primary concern as for the other
[04:13:22] questions the Death kill Robin I'm not
[04:13:24] sure the two cases were committed by the
[04:13:26] same culprit but that massive wound
[04:13:30] looked like its winged
[04:13:32] blade plus it seems unlikely that there
[04:13:35] would be two lethal entities loose in
[04:13:37] the
[04:13:38] Dreamscape do you think it's connected
[04:13:40] to acon I can't answer that question
[04:13:43] that Ranger is shrouded but a doubt she
[04:13:47] is the most special guest at this
[04:13:50] banquet what do you mean by special
[04:13:51] Black Swan have you noticed anything
[04:13:53] else unusual appearing one after the
[04:13:55] other in a very short time it is I think
[04:13:57] it's a double murder of itself that's
[04:13:59] very unusual there's an impostor sorry
[04:14:02] two possib I got to stop talking oh the
[04:14:04] collapse of picone's Dreamscape has
[04:14:07] started speeding up making death
[04:14:10] extremely agitated and weakening the
[04:14:12] family
[04:14:14] protections or everything has been
[04:14:17] planned out and executed by someone it
[04:14:21] was [ __ ] Misha dumb loser these
[04:14:23] victims deliberately first a stow away
[04:14:26] why are these in bold family
[04:14:29] celebrity then this murderer's motives
[04:14:32] are worth thoroughly chewing over
[04:14:35] stowaway than celebrity they're going to
[04:14:37] kill a third person they're going to
[04:14:38] kill the [ __ ] leader [ __ ] it I don't
[04:14:40] have any other questions Happ so quickly
[04:14:42] I can only make a conjecture after
[04:14:45] leaving here go have a chat with your
[04:14:48] companions I hope you can clarify the
[04:14:50] source they're going up the rank they
[04:14:52] went from [ __ ] nobody to important
[04:14:54] celebrity to like the CEO of pen I don't
[04:14:56] know who that is
[04:14:58] though left safe Zone a bird this way
[04:15:02] it's a short don't get
[04:15:06] lost this is where
[04:15:10] she this is where it happened
[04:15:15] this is where I lost

[04:15:29] ways all of this is like a
[04:15:33] nightmare a nightmare unfortunately the
[04:15:36] remembrance doesn't lie what we just saw
[04:15:40] is the reality that happened and it
[04:15:43] won't fade from our minds just because
[04:15:45] we wake up but follow your heart and
[04:15:48] don't be afraid we all Walk Through This

[04:18:42] rip thanks for the [ __ ] follow attack
[04:18:44] set it appears the outcome has already
[04:18:47] been
[04:18:48] determined they're still alive as are
[04:18:51] you you still have room to make a
[04:18:54] choice leave the music box behind and
[04:18:57] then go
[04:19:01] Choice the bloody Trail of the
[04:19:04] destruction leaves no room for
[04:19:08] hesitation this guy's voice is cool
[04:19:10] furus fire demon
[04:19:13] even if you sacrifice your life without
[04:19:15] that
[04:19:15] Eon you won't get special treatment this
[04:19:18] guy in love with theok Ranger is this
[04:19:21] what I'm hearing you tread the narrow
[04:19:24] path of the
[04:19:25] haunt you could never understand wait a
[04:19:29] second now I could be wrong but I'm
[04:19:30] pretty sure Aaron's not the hunt I'm
[04:19:32] pretty sure I pulled for her and it said
[04:19:34] acaron nil but what do I know I just I
[04:19:37] just know builds I'm sorry we come from
[04:19:39] the fire and are born be in
[04:19:44] fire they spread burn and Destroy until
[04:19:49] all the kindling is [ __ ] we leave only
[04:19:53] ashes on the
[04:19:56] ground burning forms the entire life of
[04:20:00] a fire
[04:20:01] de from the beginning to the
[04:20:07] end we are born to die just to put into
[04:20:12] practice of profile of another universal
[04:20:15] truth all things are created for okay
[04:20:19] this guy's a psycho this guy is
[04:20:23] insane your companions don't seem to
[04:20:25] think so they fight for your chance at
[04:20:30] survival they are my children and just
[04:20:34] as I was they are Flames that have yet
[04:20:39] to burn white
[04:20:41] heart there still still young and I
[04:20:44] don't blame them but my Flames are faint
[04:20:49] and time is running out can you see the
[04:20:53] planet of festivities in the
[04:20:57] distance her plan to bring Purgatory
[04:21:00] with me there and before that I must
[04:21:06] surpass
[04:21:08] you
[04:21:10] why because I'm the the path they
[04:21:14] fored you have traveled farther than I
[04:21:19] have
[04:21:22] emanator
[04:21:24] emanator I don't actually know what that
[04:21:26] means but I'm sure this has historical
[04:21:28] lore implications I mean I know dude
[04:21:30] Acron are equal R in other Universe all
[04:21:33] good you cannot hide maybe maybe not
[04:21:36] true
[04:21:39] identity no my fault soul
[04:21:43] for we shall indeed remain here bound to
[04:21:48] fight a decisive battle to the death for
[04:21:52] I choose that is a bolded
[04:21:55] choose destruction is
[04:21:59] intense but
[04:22:01] grief to cravenly cling to life is to
[04:22:05] endure an endlessly prolonged
[04:22:09] existence even if the answer turns out
[04:22:12] to be your own destruction what is
[04:22:14] important is not the answer but that it
[04:22:19] exists just as you
[04:22:22] exist everything exists to be
[04:22:25] destroyed eminator are no if this guy
[04:22:29] dies here did they really just hire a VA
[04:22:31] for this scene and then he's dead
[04:22:32] forever justce even sweet dreams may
[04:22:36] that's not the newest Quest yeah it is
[04:22:38] trust the so okay it's not but like 2.1
[04:22:42] still new really something that is yet
[04:22:45] to
[04:22:48] happen all right I accept you shall
[04:22:53] witness the most brilliant and intense
[04:22:57] fire in existence a bottomless
[04:23:02] dream yes that's right but you've made
[04:23:06] one small
[04:23:09] mistake this blade remains in its
[04:23:11] Scabbard not out of of pity or scorn
[04:23:15] it's a personal secret that I don't want
[04:23:16] to disclose
[04:23:18] but perhaps out of
[04:23:23] reciprocity she says this as her hand
[04:23:26] gently rests on the hilt of the sword
[04:23:28] I'll reveal the truth to you the
[04:23:31] Hunt is not the path you truly follow
[04:23:34] yeah no [ __ ] we saw the DM marketing
[04:23:37] buddy May death be the end of your
[04:23:40] boundless dream
[04:23:43] guiding you back to the waking
[04:23:47] world oh my I still see them in my
[04:23:52] dreams hold it your time hasn't come
[04:23:57] yet the
[04:23:59] [ __ ] my
[04:24:04] time I've seen many clever disguises
[04:24:07] that can conceal appearances but they
[04:24:09] can never cover up who a person really
[04:24:11] is
[04:24:13] and you're no different you had no
[04:24:15] desire to kill the
[04:24:17] Trailblazer you only did what you did to
[04:24:19] drive me and the wait a second okay
[04:24:22] but
[04:24:26] why did Destiny slave make you do it you
[04:24:30] know
[04:24:32] Elo Elo I thought this is just the kind
[04:24:35] of thing that had get written into [ __ ]
[04:24:37] you
[04:24:39] iio my script
[04:24:43] has always been
[04:24:45] brief other than that anything beyond
[04:24:49] that is
[04:24:53] unnecessary he knows my
[04:24:56] nature there is but a single Destiny
[04:25:00] from which no one can
[04:25:03] escape and until then I hold the
[04:25:07] privilege of
[04:25:10] choice however
[04:25:12] you appear to be ignorant of this so
[04:25:16] it's time for me to
[04:25:19] inquire who exactly are
[04:25:26] you not your enemy perhaps mods please B
[04:25:30] the first time chatted that said I'm
[04:25:31] like Lord farquad if he wasn't a Lord
[04:25:34] please that's not what I asked I don't
[04:25:38] deserve your
[04:25:39] curiosity loner is wandering the ca most
[04:25:42] always have their
[04:25:44] secrets take
[04:25:46] me I've also been wanted by the IPC so
[04:25:49] it's Little Wonder I know something
[04:25:51] about the stellon
[04:25:53] hunters that's
[04:25:55] all maybe I can
[04:25:58] help what reason would you have for
[04:26:02] doing that be 3 months I T to forget
[04:26:07] things which is why rather than memories
[04:26:11] I'm accustomed to using my emotions to
[04:26:13] capture what I normally wouldn't
[04:26:15] otherwise I know who was inside that
[04:26:18] cold
[04:26:19] armor wait did she also see the drip
[04:26:22] marketing me
[04:26:26] too how about it ready to honestly if
[04:26:30] they show it this early it's not even
[04:26:31] spoilers then cuz like realistically the
[04:26:33] drip marketing came out like a week ago
[04:26:34] it's at the start of the quest so it's
[04:26:36] not like it was like a big spoiler I
[04:26:38] mean it kind of was yet whatever my
[04:26:40] fault oh never mind she okay huh I don't
[04:26:43] need help but I can give you a
[04:26:46] suggestion that would make things better
[04:26:49] for you and me all right so give me a
[04:26:51] suggestion Sam if your goal is the watch
[04:26:53] Maker's
[04:26:55] Legacy then go look into the
[04:26:59] family not only are they covering up the
[04:27:02] existence of
[04:27:04] death but they're burying the past and
[04:27:08] the truth about what happens inside that
[04:27:11] looks like a
[04:27:13] dice already on it and the astral
[04:27:19] Express is no enemy of yours true I know
[04:27:23] that I just never expected to hear you
[04:27:26] say a Sam likes us what's next then the
[04:27:30] Trailblazer has been taken by Black
[04:27:33] Swan will you go look for her no need
[04:27:36] for that no harm in mentioning that
[04:27:39] Elio's only given me one instruction
[04:27:44] of the astral Express to track down the
[04:27:47] grand
[04:27:51] Legacy I tried settling this in an
[04:27:53] easier and more direct way but as you
[04:27:57] can see here I am confronting you I
[04:28:04] failed can't ever go against the script
[04:28:08] the so-called impossible is merely
[04:28:11] something that has yet to
[04:28:16] happen that's
[04:28:18] it before we split can I ask you one
[04:28:21] more thing this is going to sound really
[04:28:23] weird to say but why didn't they give
[04:28:25] Sam a bit more cake I'm really sorry for
[04:28:27] saying that I'm just saying if you're
[04:28:28] going to make a big ass robot is there
[04:28:30] anything else in your script about
[04:28:34] me I'd like to know what kind of
[04:28:36] footnote I believe in that in R future
[04:28:39] foreseen by Destiny
[04:28:43] unfortunately not a thing came
[04:28:50] up I knew it I knew it
[04:28:56] sorry hang
[04:29:01] on
[04:29:03] I
[04:29:05] don't don't what your first question
[04:29:10] was do you you still have dreams about
[04:29:15] everyone who died because of
[04:29:18] you I
[04:29:21] don't never have well I was born without
[04:29:26] the ability the s s they they're
[04:29:28] stealing the dreams it it's the's quest
[04:29:33] for this cold harsh reality Sor I'm
[04:29:36] sorry for a little
[04:29:39] life to burn sorry sorry sorry keep
[04:29:42] cring reference my bad on
[04:29:46] burning until I turn to
[04:29:53] Ash
[04:29:55] so I really Envy
[04:30:00] en is that
[04:30:02] so then you're already living in the
[04:30:04] waking
[04:30:09] world not sure what that last line meant
[04:30:11] to be honest but okay that was a cool
[04:30:14] cut
[04:30:15] scene present day golden
[04:30:19] hour we heard about Miss Firefly from
[04:30:23] Black
[04:30:24] Swan but we never expected miss Robin
[04:30:30] too I'm sorry that I couldn't be with
[04:30:33] you then reality cruises on in Serenity
[04:30:38] while undercurrents Bubble Up from the
[04:30:40] Dreamscape just like like that memoe
[04:30:42] keeper
[04:30:44] said stay strong everyone we can still
[04:30:48] do what we can for them starting with
[04:30:51] finding the murderer let's recap
[04:30:54] everything then the Trailblazer just
[04:30:57] reminded me of something March do you
[04:31:00] remember what that family rep who
[04:31:02] negotiated with us said I family rep who
[04:31:05] negotiated with us uh yeah from like two
[04:31:08] quests ago I remember yeah indeed we
[04:31:11] trust that the nameless has nothing to
[04:31:13] do with this and we are each of you to
[04:31:16] help assist the family in verifying the
[04:31:18] identity of the deas I I remember that's
[04:31:22] how it was put in reference to miss
[04:31:27] Firefly looking back he seemed a little
[04:31:31] evasive at the time and he also failed
[04:31:33] to mention anything about the earlier
[04:31:35] murder this is the benefit of doing 2.1
[04:31:37] and 2.2 Quest like back to back right
[04:31:39] cuz now because I can do 2.1 and then
[04:31:40] 2.2 I won't forget anything from 2.1
[04:31:43] surely but like the 2.0 [ __ ] that was
[04:31:45] like a year ago the family is planning
[04:31:48] on covering up all news about Miss
[04:31:49] Robin's death if news gets out penacon
[04:31:53] is going to turn into a blood bath but
[04:31:56] the murder that followed closely after
[04:31:58] was obviously beyond their
[04:32:00] anticipation the family had to try and
[04:32:02] turn things to their advantage by
[04:32:04] bringing in reinforcements from
[04:32:06] outside the Charmy Festival is nearly
[04:32:09] here they must be in May o be that Miss
[04:32:13] Firefly's murder had so many witnesses
[04:32:15] that it couldn't be covered up so they
[04:32:18] went with the flow and let more people
[04:32:20] on the scene to control the situation
[04:32:23] after all the nature of the two murders
[04:32:26] is fundamentally
[04:32:27] different the family's first protective
[04:32:30] measure should be against malicious
[04:32:32] actors among the guests such as that IPC
[04:32:35] onvoy IPC Envoy he's up to no good Avent
[04:32:39] is on guard against Aron indeed he was
[04:32:42] particularly concerned about that galaxy
[04:32:45] ranger are we missing the forest for the
[04:32:48] trees here I always felt that aventurine
[04:32:51] reasons for accusing Miss Zaron were
[04:32:54] highly subtle since when does March
[04:32:56] think am I dumb has she always been like
[04:32:58] I feel like March used to just be like
[04:33:00] oh candy and then Dan Hong would be like
[04:33:02] no March since when does she say [ __ ]
[04:33:04] like I always felt like adventurin
[04:33:06] reasons for accusing Miss Arron were
[04:33:08] highly
[04:33:09] subtle at this point
[04:33:12] that's Pon no no like she's not dumb but
[04:33:14] she's like kind of like a like a puppy
[04:33:16] like o that's
[04:33:18] cool look let's try to gather Intel
[04:33:21] first and then list all the possible
[04:33:23] outcomes we can then we go through them
[04:33:25] eliminating contradictions one by one
[04:33:29] the fewer facts remaining the closer we
[04:33:31] are to the truth I've still got this
[04:33:34] sense of for boating it's like we're
[04:33:37] stuck in a Whirlpool spinning around
[04:33:40] that Legacy even after
[04:33:42] that Legacy this time we're playing the
[04:33:44] role of a real
[04:33:46] detective but before we start what are
[04:33:49] we going to say to the family and event
[04:33:52] as I see things the family Harbors no
[04:33:55] ill will towards the astral Express if
[04:33:57] they didn't trust the crew they wouldn't
[04:33:59] have casually commissioned Outsiders to
[04:34:01] investigate a case that's in all
[04:34:03] likelihood a scandal okay so let me get
[04:34:05] this right if the family doesn't hate us
[04:34:06] and acon doesn't hate us and Firefly rip
[04:34:09] Bozo not really but maybe likes us then
[04:34:11] why the [ __ ] are we here we're chilling
[04:34:12] can we just leave go to another [ __ ]
[04:34:14] planet [ __ ] pany plus this is
[04:34:17] thef teaming up with them should make
[04:34:20] things easier for us in the
[04:34:22] future as for that
[04:34:24] aventurine well I'd like to hear your
[04:34:27] thoughts I think he's a quite
[04:34:30] interesting man watch complex I knew
[04:34:33] itely slow playay I got I'm going to
[04:34:36] wake up my neighbors while running
[04:34:38] around us all the while
[04:34:43] he appealed convincingly to both reason
[04:34:46] and Tion it wasn't forced but the intent
[04:34:50] was obvious still it's good to have
[04:34:53] contacts among all this
[04:34:55] uncertainty adventurine showed his
[04:34:58] skills reliable Ally okay also need to
[04:35:00] keep a certain distance from the family
[04:35:02] never there food not here
[04:35:04] yet teaming up with the IPC helps
[04:35:07] balance that out if either side makes a
[04:35:09] move we have the option to pull out
[04:35:12] so you suggest acting venturine proposal
[04:35:16] to team Firefly body pillow thanks for
[04:35:17] the five gift I appreciate you yes it's
[04:35:20] risky but we can only wait until both
[04:35:23] sides have played their cards before
[04:35:24] making any further judgments I get why
[04:35:29] but there's a whole lot of bad guys and
[04:35:31] girls around here and I'm worried about
[04:35:34] getting stabbed in the back she's been
[04:35:36] bullied a few times now and I can't
[04:35:39] stand it
[04:35:40] anymore it's fine you can bully me
[04:35:42] whenever you no I can't accept this
[04:35:47] forget about it just let me keep an eye
[04:35:49] on him if that doesn't work we can just
[04:35:52] turn the tables and use him instead then
[04:35:55] could you please reply to
[04:35:58] aventurine everyone sure I'll reply
[04:36:00] thanks OKO just stay in the train and
[04:36:02] please don't get
[04:36:07] hurt we'll
[04:36:09] collaborate wonderful you response came

[04:36:17] all be in this together here's some
[04:36:19] 100 that's

[04:36:47] always get 200k or did I just do did the
[04:36:49] option actually matter cuz look I got
[04:36:51] 200 [ __ ] plus 200k God
[04:36:55] damn goal is to try and recapture penone
[04:36:59] for oh you always do okay well I'd like
[04:37:01] to think that my decision mattered have
[04:37:02] to bring down the family in its entirety
[04:37:05] to create a big enough chance the
[04:37:07] existence of death will be covered up by
[04:37:10] the family
[04:37:12] perhaps he's going for the family he's
[04:37:15] definitely going for the family and it's
[04:37:17] just a matter of how the harmony is
[04:37:21] strong in Pentagon and almost impossible
[04:37:23] to take on head
[04:37:25] to-head tra's going for AC has devoted
[04:37:29] considerable attention to her perhaps
[04:37:31] he's going for the astral Express I was
[04:37:32] also perhaps he's going for the hotel
[04:37:35] hotel
[04:37:36] guests I'm just speculating in any case
[04:37:41] we have to be careful he's CLE a born
[04:37:44] Gambler if he's willing to go all in to
[04:37:49] win dude I forgot heo when she was
[04:37:52] talking earlier in the cut scene I
[04:37:53] forgot she has like a mole and I was I
[04:37:55] was de I was trying to wipe my monitor
[04:37:56] like I thought there's like a stain on
[04:37:57] my monitor like a little like
[04:37:59] dot the [ __ ] is this this looks like
[04:38:03] Robin sus I hope it's not too soon to
[04:38:07] bring it up but I feel like Miss Rob
[04:38:11] isn't actually dead but that she's still
[04:38:14] alive and well somewhere huh that's
[04:38:18] crazy March just some horrible prank
[04:38:23] because I mean probably not aren't we
[04:38:25] supposed to be inside a
[04:38:27] dream how could someone die in a
[04:38:31] beautiful Dreamscape like this shouldn't
[04:38:34] only good things happen here I mean I
[04:38:36] don't know if she's alive or not I just
[04:38:37] know she's in my party but I don't know
[04:38:39] what that says surely it's just a dream
[04:38:40] though Dreamscape true whenever I see
[04:38:43] the Grand
[04:38:45] Theater I just can't stop all these
[04:38:47] thoughts from flooding my
[04:38:50] head you think the family is behind all
[04:38:55] this no no after all they've brought
[04:38:59] everyone this sleepy Dreamscape which
[04:39:01] everyone loves I just feel like I'm
[04:39:06] starting to understand them less and
[04:39:08] less I don't trust the family March
[04:39:10] everyone still having a great time out
[04:39:12] there on the
[04:39:14] streets nobody knows what's
[04:39:17] happened it's all so
[04:39:20] unreal as if Firefly miss Robin and us
[04:39:26] were all Outsiders From Another World a
[04:39:30] what a mess I really want a nice cool
[04:39:33] drink of soda to help me calm down yeah
[04:39:35] let's go get some soul
[04:39:37] glad then I'd be just like everyone else
[04:39:40] out on the stre streets
[04:39:42] true it'll be okay
[04:39:45] March hello welt Yang venturine said
[04:39:48] something that concerns me he accused
[04:39:51] that galaxy ranger of killing Robin
[04:39:53] without any evidence whatsoever but said
[04:39:56] nothing about her connection to that
[04:39:58] memory Zone meme or why he was stalking
[04:40:03] you it was a groundless accusation which
[04:40:07] only serves to make him seem more
[04:40:10] suspicious
[04:40:12] dude she's going to be like watch watch
[04:40:13] watch watch aventurine it'll come out he
[04:40:15] was right about everything Aron's going
[04:40:17] to be like I had no choice I had a dream
[04:40:20] and then that's the end of the quest
[04:40:22] Cliffhanger does adventurine have other
[04:40:24] plans the adventurine goal was never to
[04:40:26] gain our trust maybe he wanted to foster
[04:40:29] a feeling of enmity towards acaron and
[04:40:33] make this size of frames wait is
[04:40:34] actually how's it lagging however I
[04:40:37] asked Don hung back on the express to
[04:40:39] confirm that story about the ation gang
[04:40:42] and the lost
[04:40:43] messages it wasn't something that
[04:40:45] adventuring up out of thin air that's
[04:40:48] fine now I Clos my Google what's your
[04:40:50] impression of Miss Aaron I think she's
[04:40:52] cool she definitely let [ __ ] Firefly
[04:40:54] die she's a very powerful
[04:40:56] woman
[04:40:58] oh
[04:41:00] okay um that fits The Stereotype of a
[04:41:03] galaxy ranger 2 I guess I can't
[04:41:07] remember they're eccentric unpredictable
[04:41:11] you being alone no wonder she's a
[04:41:16] suspect yo why can't I talk need
[04:41:20] anything else let's turn our attention
[04:41:22] to this reminds me of the time Ron may
[04:41:24] put [ __ ] drugs in my cup or cake what
[04:41:27] do you think and then drugged me but got
[04:41:28] away with it because she's
[04:41:30] pretty let's turn to our attention uh
[04:41:33] the family's assignment for now him what
[04:41:34] do you think among our current Clues the
[04:41:36] two murders that she witnessed are the
[04:41:39] most directly
[04:41:40] connected I suggest starting
[04:41:43] here one thing I'm curious about is if a
[04:41:47] person dies in a dream what happens to
[04:41:50] them in real life seeing as we're at the
[04:41:53] family's behest why not pop back out to
[04:41:57] reality and verify Miss Firefly
[04:41:59] situation back at the
[04:42:01] hotel perhaps we could also make a few
[04:42:03] inquiries about miss Robin while we're
[04:42:05] out
[04:42:07] there how about we split off into two
[04:42:10] groups there are still some things worth
[04:42:13] focusing on inside the Dreamscape worth
[04:42:17] focusing on oh no problem
[04:42:20] oh no problem huh a I I will sorry we
[04:42:26] got a long way to go I'm sorry enough
[04:42:29] yapping uhoh wel
[04:42:32] moment honored guest could you come out
[04:42:36] for a second wait wait wait well go back
[04:42:37] in the chip brother
[04:42:47] I'd be embarrassed too getting stared
[04:42:49] out like
[04:42:51] that yo forgive me uh my name is wel
[04:42:55] Yang I'm one of the crew members on the
[04:42:57] astral Express I believe you've met my
[04:43:02] colleagues
[04:43:03] well uhoh
[04:43:06] uhoh is there something about my name
[04:43:10] okay fill this closure I know wel from
[04:43:12] like hongkai third he just like trained
[04:43:13] over but I don't know if like Aron knows
[04:43:15] or some [ __ ] as I don't know if he was a
[04:43:16] filler character or not but I feel like
[04:43:18] there's something here don't you want to
[04:43:20] know my name it's written right there
[04:43:23] it's acaron I already do miss acaron
[04:43:26] true you're a prominent figure in panone
[04:43:29] she plays on guy
[04:43:31] third what are they saying about me some
[04:43:34] claim that you're the real culprit
[04:43:36] Behind These murders that the
[04:43:38] annihilation gang's tragic fate at the
[04:43:40] bank it was a result of your
[04:43:43] blade and that you're now attempting to
[04:43:46] unleash another bloodbath on
[04:43:49] pentacon the annihilation gang iFit of
[04:43:53] everflame mansion okay tragic fate that
[04:43:58] Duke turned his dying body to flames and
[04:44:00] sacrificed his life as a martyr he was a
[04:44:03] determined and heroic path
[04:44:05] Strider not even a villain should be
[04:44:07] disparaged like this
[04:44:11] and what's more there were plenty of
[04:44:12] suspects invited do they really think
[04:44:16] that a blade is more dangerous than that
[04:44:19] black hole you're wielding hey how do
[04:44:21] you know what the hell did she also pull
[04:44:24] wel Keen intuition not even the family
[04:44:28] managed to point out the truth behind
[04:44:30] this
[04:44:32] cane so you must surely know Aaron
[04:44:37] peering into a black hole is not a wise
[04:44:40] move as a Potential Threat he's not even
[04:44:43] holding the cane how does she see it
[04:44:45] uncomfortable depths where the [ __ ] is
[04:44:47] bro cane reveal your true identity and
[04:44:51] intentions otherwise brace yourself for
[04:44:55] gravitational
[04:44:58] disintegration that shouldn't be
[04:45:01] necessary but if it makes the nameless
[04:45:03] feel less def we is kind of a Chad to
[04:45:06] abide Believe It or Not galaxy ranger
[04:45:10] acaron
[04:45:12] those are the names I go by to this very
[04:45:14] day my trip to panon is solely to
[04:45:17] fulfill an old final request hello is
[04:45:20] that my wife uh yeah I think the food's
[04:45:23] here low key do you want to get it or
[04:45:24] should I get it it's like arriving now
[04:45:27] an idiot sandwich yeah but it's like I'm
[04:45:29] like tired do you want me to go get it I
[04:45:31] can go I can go get it don't worry can
[04:45:32] you make me a coffee though I I'll make
[04:45:33] it I'll go get it never it's like a
[04:45:35] trade deal no it's fine I'll do
[04:45:37] it really good thank you
[04:45:42] thank
[04:45:43] you I'm here for the watchmaker's Legacy
[04:45:47] okay and that's
[04:45:48] it I think I've been honest
[04:45:52] enough still unwilling to reveal your
[04:45:55] true
[04:45:56] identity it's not that I don't want to
[04:45:59] it's just that I
[04:46:01] can't I've come so far and I can't sum
[04:46:04] up all of that in just a few
[04:46:07] words everyone has their own unspeakable
[04:46:10] past
[04:46:11] secrets that they don't want to be
[04:46:14] revealed and I won't be asking any more
[04:46:16] questions such as why the astral Express
[04:46:19] is roaming around the cosmos with a
[04:46:21] stellon on
[04:46:24] board sh she knows what the [ __ ] did she
[04:46:34] know is she
[04:46:36] okay that memo keeper didn't do anything
[04:46:40] right
[04:46:42] she's fine let's just stick with the
[04:46:45] topic gaining my trust depends on how
[04:46:48] much you're willing to
[04:46:50] reveal I've run around many different
[04:46:53] pentacon Dreamscapes just to try and
[04:46:55] find that Legacy and during this period
[04:46:58] I came into contact with quite a few
[04:47:00] guests in the process I gradually came
[04:47:04] to
[04:47:05] realize the secret of
[04:47:08] pentacon may be closely related to the
[04:47:10] the
[04:47:14] trailblaze that's why I've come to ask
[04:47:16] for your help I don't have enough proof
[04:47:19] yet but I'd like to speculate something
[04:47:22] probably the source of all tragedy lies
[04:47:24] within the probably no trust of the
[04:47:26] [ __ ] family if you could trust me we
[04:47:29] could find the proof to support this
[04:47:30] claim together Mr Yang I think you've
[04:47:34] come to the same conclusion
[04:47:37] haven't let's leave it at that for now
[04:47:41] I'll choose to believe that you bear no
[04:47:44] hostility share your findings with me
[04:47:47] and me alone I don't want vague
[04:47:49] conjecture to interfere with other
[04:47:51] people's judgments before we find solid
[04:47:54] proof mhm mhm by the way would you like
[04:47:59] something to drink before we go how
[04:48:01] about two cups of wake the heck up okay
[04:48:05] no four
[04:48:07] cups because the conversation coming up
[04:48:10] will last forever oh what do you mean by
[04:48:12] that also where is this guy
[04:48:16] looking was his head curved or was that
[04:48:18] just
[04:48:22] me I've been watching her closely for a
[04:48:25] while now and the first invitation was
[04:48:27] in the banquet hall of the hotel she
[04:48:30] just sat in one corner keeping silent
[04:48:33] chugging down a couple cups of wake the
[04:48:35] heck up I told her it's a pungent bitter
[04:48:39] beverage not the taste of sweet dreams
[04:48:42] only for people allergic to Soul glad
[04:48:45] and she
[04:48:48] said
[04:48:50] really but I don't taste any difference
[04:48:53] at all between
[04:48:57] [Music]
[04:48:59] them the guest rooms are charmingly
[04:49:02] minimalist an aesthetic you share Miss
[04:49:07] acaron it's a cinch this music box
[04:49:11] the invitation received by the
[04:49:13] annihilation gang there are latent
[04:49:16] memories that Linger on it
[04:49:18] yet you see memories of you are not
[04:49:21] yours alone they travel in other people
[04:49:24] other
[04:49:26] things I know much and I can predict
[04:49:29] even more with some help the dead can be
[04:49:33] made to
[04:49:34] speak the annihilation Gang That Band of
[04:49:38] Desperados who all disappeared after
[04:49:40] meeting you what exactly happened to
[04:49:44] them well let me reveal
[04:49:49] all
[04:49:53] okay gradation
[04:49:56] 12
[04:49:58] Dreamscape
[04:50:00] 12 father I dedicate this to you well
[04:50:07] done dbra
[04:50:11] wherever they go shall be met by
[04:50:18] Annihilation there it is it's hazy but
[04:50:21] it's ifit's voice the other one is
[04:50:24] probably his
[04:50:26] progeny this is the residual memory from
[04:50:29] when the invitation was first delivered
[04:50:32] they were abruptly
[04:50:34] interrupted then what happened next is
[04:50:41] they sought refuge in the land of
[04:50:45] sleep merely wishing for UND Disturbed
[04:50:49] rest away from the

[04:54:01] sovereignty has hereby been established
[04:54:04] the formation of the seian sovereignty

[04:59:36] nobody outside I know what you are there
[04:59:40] not even baseless conspiracy theories
[04:59:42] they are still streaming the rehearsal
[04:59:45] for her ceremony using a standon I
[04:59:48] guess they must be
[04:59:51] dreaming of
[04:59:53] course who could imagine this would
[04:59:55] actually descend upon the idic dream
[04:59:58] created by the family let alone that the
[05:00:01] victim would be the female lead of the
[05:00:03] Charmy Festival to be honest with you I
[05:00:06] didn't believe it I even tested it a few
[05:00:09] times myself um until I discovered that
[05:00:12] I couldn't actually
[05:00:14] die whenever there's any danger I'm
[05:00:17] forced awake by The Dream pool and it's
[05:00:19] all as if everything were just a
[05:00:25] nightmare wait did he try to [ __ ]
[05:00:27] silver wolf himself IM death actually
[05:00:29] descend uh dream family on the victim
[05:00:32] honestly I didn't believe I even tested
[05:00:34] a few times now
[05:00:36] B that's why I'm convinced that there
[05:00:39] are a few big Secrets lurking behind the
[05:00:43] scenes then you must have heard about
[05:00:45] the memory Zone meme when I graciously
[05:00:48] dained to establish connections with the
[05:00:50] oak family on your behalf they were
[05:00:53] quite in a pitiful state of of disarray
[05:00:56] besides Robin there was another
[05:00:59] body I don't know the exact details just
[05:01:03] that it
[05:01:04] was she's more than that okay two murder
[05:01:08] cases
[05:01:10] I told you something seemed off about
[05:01:12] the
[05:01:12] nameless oh she must have come across
[05:01:15] hey what's up guys welcome to my classes
[05:01:17] tier list starting in the a tier we have
[05:01:19] Dr Rao and Ayo and moving up to the S
[05:01:22] tier is going to be Sunday thanks for
[05:01:24] watch this murderer is a
[05:01:27] psycho I have to say the case does
[05:01:30] represent an
[05:01:32] opportunity we can leverage the family's
[05:01:34] malfant and let the IPC use this as a
[05:01:36] reason to
[05:01:37] intervene it's just that they're
[05:01:39] trickery runs deeper than I
[05:01:42] thought Robin standon was all ready to
[05:01:46] go these two murders are definitely
[05:01:48] getting hushed
[05:01:50] up what should we
[05:01:53] do let me
[05:01:54] think it's too rare an opportunity to
[05:01:57] miss out on so I got to be careful this
[05:02:01] guy got a gold watch a gold band a
[05:02:04] [ __ ] double three rings incredible
[05:02:07] Gambler have you already exhausted your
[05:02:11] limited repertoire of Tricks so
[05:02:14] soon there are plenty of chips but it'd
[05:02:17] be best to choose
[05:02:19] carefully the most
[05:02:22] straightforward has to be
[05:02:24] Robin remember that masked fool once
[05:02:28] told me to find a mute as a friend Robin
[05:02:31] is what she calls the mute she has lost
[05:02:33] her voice and while most people can't
[05:02:35] pick up on it you and I cannot mistake
[05:02:38] that sound not produced by any voice box
[05:02:41] but rather by the Resonance of the
[05:02:43] harmony wait
[05:02:46] what if that girl hadn't gone horse from
[05:02:49] singing practice there'd only be one
[05:02:52] possibility something was up with the
[05:02:55] family or Robin
[05:02:57] herself to get to the bottom of this I
[05:03:00] tried every way I could to meet her but
[05:03:02] she
[05:03:04] died right before my very eyes okay what
[05:03:08] you have to say it like that a complete
[05:03:10] and utter
[05:03:11] loss incidentally it seems to have
[05:03:14] resulted in your rather undignified
[05:03:17] arrival on the interrogation
[05:03:20] stand there were eyewitnesses at the
[05:03:23] scene and the family in their
[05:03:26] graciousness has tentatively accepted
[05:03:28] your
[05:03:29] Alibi however for the foreseeable future
[05:03:34] you shall
[05:03:35] regrettably find yourself under the
[05:03:38] Vigilant watch of the pounds well things
[05:03:41] aren't looking too optimistic doctor
[05:03:43] starting to break out in a cold
[05:03:46] sweat do you
[05:03:49] reckon there's still any chance of a
[05:03:51] comeback given how things are a
[05:03:56] probability yes it exists but it verges
[05:03:59] on the infantes smal to phrase it in a
[05:04:02] matter more befitting the vernacular of
[05:04:04] pentacon you're
[05:04:07] dreaming but if you simply can't control
[05:04:09] yourself and want to try your hand then
[05:04:11] there just so happens to be a suitable
[05:04:14] candidate that man wants to see you
[05:04:17] again who Sunday Sunday I knew
[05:04:22] it is this a public hearing or a private
[05:04:25] trial if it were the former it would
[05:04:29] hardly befit my stature to stoop to the
[05:04:32] role of a mere
[05:04:36] messenger okay
[05:04:42] fine well that's great it's all great
[05:04:45] you see the dead can't talk but the
[05:04:48] living can ratio I'm convinced now that
[05:04:51] there must be something wrong inside the
[05:04:53] family oh just you wait and see that
[05:04:57] man's sister has died he can't sit on
[05:05:00] his hands without any further Ado let's
[05:05:03] set off lead the way the show is about
[05:05:07] to begin so this is uh we're adventuring
[05:05:11] now POV here the dite Pavilion is the
[05:05:15] oak family's Fortress and a place where
[05:05:18] heads of the families meet to discuss
[05:05:20] great plans for
[05:05:24] panone the
[05:05:26] Fortress I like this
[05:05:28] metaphor I dealt with the Warlords of
[05:05:31] the amanica star system not long AG they

[05:05:46] without his Express invitation the likes

[05:23:07] four the joyous tour of toy city has
[05:23:10] come to an end makes me feel
[05:23:14] sad panone isn't all bad right I'll use
[05:23:18] this interesting experience as a talking
[05:23:21] point at the poker
[05:23:30] table head to the family's Castle
[05:23:32] chamber and F Sunday wait bet it's a
[05:23:36] pity you made it out of the sand pit
[05:23:39] alive Sunday is just beyond this door
[05:23:43] from my limited understanding he's not
[05:23:45] someone easily
[05:23:47] handled are you
[05:23:50] prepared yeah only I believe he's the
[05:23:53] one who should be prepared to face
[05:23:56] me tell me about your
[05:23:59] plan I don't have a plan I'll just play
[05:24:02] it by ear there are only two kinds of
[05:24:05] bargaining chips when dealing with
[05:24:07] people
[05:24:09] benefit or
[05:24:11] fear looks like sincerity isn't in your
[05:24:19] dictionary am I not sincere
[05:24:22] enough there's no need to emphasize it
[05:24:26] we've got to make good use of death and
[05:24:28] I'll help find the
[05:24:31] murderer the man sister is
[05:24:34] dead he can't do it due to his status
[05:24:37] and position but I
[05:24:38] can and that's
[05:24:42] benefit on what basis do you believe
[05:24:45] he's
[05:24:46] incapable necessitating the delegation
[05:24:48] to someone from a rival faction the
[05:24:53] IPC simple because that murderer could
[05:24:57] very well be a traitor hiding inside the
[05:25:02] family um do you mean the galaxy ranger
[05:25:07] whom you accused used
[05:25:10] previously that was just an excuse good
[05:25:13] doctor there's something wrong with that
[05:25:15] woman we need someone who can keep her
[05:25:17] in check it's better to minimize the
[05:25:20] variables outside our control while we
[05:25:22] execute our
[05:25:24] plans moreover I need to know her
[05:25:27] identity if I'm
[05:25:29] lucky she could be an important pawn and
[05:25:33] it's good to have more helpful friends
[05:25:35] when dealing with this matter
[05:25:38] but honestly the murder case is likely
[05:25:40] unrelated to her I believe my standpoint
[05:25:43] there's a rat in the family otherwise
[05:25:47] why would Mr Sunday arrange a private
[05:25:49] meeting with
[05:25:50] us this isn't an interrogation but a
[05:25:53] secret
[05:25:55] negotiation we see using Robin's death
[05:25:59] as a bargaining chip I'll win back my
[05:26:02] freedom and
[05:26:04] Power in the end I'll ruin this
[05:26:07] beautiful dream and create the grandest
[05:26:12] death if the chance of winning is just
[05:26:15] beyond this
[05:26:16] door even if that chance is close to
[05:26:18] zero
[05:26:20] well you can't win if you don't play yo
[05:26:24] D Roba fans this guy not like a slightly
[05:26:26] or not slightly like pretty less insane
[05:26:28] version of Kida
[05:26:30] thoughts the I thought he'd be as insane
[05:26:32] he a bit less insane to think that you
[05:26:36] of all people might emerge Victorious
[05:26:38] vious dear Gambler no okay three chips
[05:26:41] are enough what do you mean no yes for
[05:26:53] nothing meet Sunday face to face all
[05:26:55] right I'm going to go as
[05:26:57] Robin sister you're
[05:27:00] back [ __ ] thought I could sneak up on
[05:27:02] them my puzzles are too effortless for
[05:27:04] you IPC Ambassador I appreciate your
[05:27:08] words and I see you put a lot of effort
[05:27:12] into welcoming me Mr
[05:27:15] Sunday however this is no way to greet a
[05:27:19] guest well this isn't an invitation but
[05:27:22] a
[05:27:23] summoning before we speak I need to test
[05:27:26] your
[05:27:27] character I imagine this knowledgeable
[05:27:31] doctor friend of yours has been of great
[05:27:33] help
[05:27:34] yes
[05:27:36] certainly you ought to know know this
[05:27:38] better than I do he's already Faithfully
[05:27:41] fulfilled his
[05:27:43] duties hasn't
[05:27:45] he yes the doctor has assured me of your
[05:27:48] noble character he considers you like
[05:27:52] himself a virtuous person who can be
[05:27:55] trusted by the
[05:27:56] family I have come to know you very well
[05:27:59] as a person Mr
[05:28:01] aventurine you're diligent generous and
[05:28:05] willing to
[05:28:06] cooperate the fact fact that you
[05:28:08] succeeded in overcoming many obstacles
[05:28:11] just to meet me gave me the reason to
[05:28:14] believe in your wisdom and
[05:28:16] courage but there's one thing I must ask
[05:28:20] you that is you've used your wisdom at
[05:28:23] the wrong place to meet the wrong person
[05:28:26] and put yourself in a situation where
[05:28:28] you shouldn't be witnessing a tragedy
[05:28:32] that shouldn't have
[05:28:33] happened you don't look too well am I
[05:28:37] making you anxious
[05:28:40] if not then it means I'm on your
[05:28:43] side if I wasn't mistaken you'd just
[05:28:47] made a serious accusation against the
[05:28:50] family no you weren't mistaken for
[05:28:54] depravity is creeping in around
[05:28:58] you there's no need for us to be
[05:29:01] evasive let's talk about your
[05:29:04] sister your sister's Talent is unrivaled
[05:29:07] in the world of show
[05:29:08] business as you know her voice has been
[05:29:11] out of tune since she returned to it's
[05:29:14] not out of
[05:29:15] tune once more
[05:29:17] disheartening she can't sing
[05:29:20] anymore who could be responsible for
[05:29:23] this many suspect the culprit is Among
[05:29:26] The Outsiders but I
[05:29:28] know you hold a different
[05:29:32] opinion now your Noble status has become
[05:29:34] a shackle preventing you from
[05:29:36] apprehending the murderer and aent Ving
[05:29:38] your sister's death you're feeling
[05:29:40] anxious because you're out on a
[05:29:43] limb but don't worry I'm on your
[05:29:47] side I'm immensely honored by your
[05:29:49] concern for me Mr aventurine since
[05:29:52] you're so selfless and generous I
[05:29:55] believe you wouldn't ask for anything in
[05:29:57] return would
[05:29:59] you well naturally you wouldn't incur
[05:30:01] any loss from this I just want to
[05:30:04] reclaim what is mine my Liberty and the
[05:30:08] personal items under the family's
[05:30:11] custody the bag of gift money and that's
[05:30:14] a pretty long list buddy the Box in
[05:30:16] which the Cornerstone is
[05:30:19] stored that's
[05:30:21] right
[05:30:23] Cornerstone I've heard it's a treasured
[05:30:25] asset is the [ __ ] Minecraft or a
[05:30:29] stone preservation I guess
[05:30:33] Cobblestone power and every liquidation
[05:30:36] specialist holds one
[05:30:39] for an object so precious it probably
[05:30:42] comes at an even higher price than other
[05:30:44] forms of
[05:30:46] recompense well I'm sure you're aware of
[05:30:48] the high level of risk I'll be
[05:30:50] undertaking to bring the truth to light
[05:30:53] Mr aventurine when you're out and about
[05:30:57] do you always make adjustments to your
[05:30:59] appearance your tie should be on the
[05:31:01] center line your shirt must not protrude
[05:31:04] from your vest your trouser creases
[05:31:07] should be perfectly straight and always
[05:31:10] aligned with the tips of your shoes of
[05:31:13] course but I don't because it's not
[05:31:16] appropriate to do so in
[05:31:18] public of course you make sure
[05:31:20] everything is presentable and in order
[05:31:22] before leaving the
[05:31:24] house I'm not the kind that takes risks
[05:31:28] the Cornerstone must be in the custody
[05:31:30] of the
[05:31:31] family no room for
[05:31:34] negotiation please don't let me turn you
[05:31:38] down
[05:31:39] twice sure the gift money is good enough
[05:31:43] I suppose you wouldn't mind that after
[05:31:46] all a merchant can't function without a
[05:31:48] bargaining
[05:31:49] chip you compromised quicker than I
[05:31:52] thought unfortunately it's a gambler
[05:31:55] that needs a bargaining chip not a
[05:31:58] merchant I can give you your gift money
[05:32:01] but before that I want you to tell
[05:32:05] me uhoh
[05:32:10] the fact that you can decisively forsake
[05:32:12] the Box you asked for what exactly is
[05:32:16] stored in
[05:32:22] it oh triplef faced Soul please sear his
[05:32:26] tongue Pals with a hot iron so that he
[05:32:29] will not be able to fabricate lies and
[05:32:31] make false
[05:32:36] vows what have you tell
[05:32:39] under the light of the harmony all
[05:32:42] wickedness is
[05:32:44] revealed I implore them to shed their
[05:32:47] light and I'll ask you questions on
[05:32:49] their
[05:32:50] behalf next you have3 seconds to prove
[05:32:55] your innocence what the gain this like
[05:32:58] what Ron May did but without drugging
[05:33:02] us and if I refuse to answer you can try
[05:33:07] and we'll see see if the harmony rejects
[05:33:13] you question do you own a
[05:33:17] Cornerstone no I mean I went I haven't
[05:33:19] played Minecraft in a while I went
[05:33:21] mining once but it what a simple answer
[05:33:25] you too understand that idle chatter
[05:33:28] leads only to
[05:33:30] Poverty did you hand over the
[05:33:32] Cornerstone to the family when you
[05:33:34] entered
[05:33:35] pentacon yes does the Cornerstone you
[05:33:38] handed over to the family belonged to
[05:33:41] you yes is your Cornerstone in this room
[05:33:46] right now yes is your memory free from
[05:33:49] any kind of tampering or deletion
[05:33:52] encompassing but not restricted to the
[05:33:54] techniques of the garden of
[05:33:58] recollection yes are you an Ain from
[05:34:03] seonia
[05:34:06] yes you even know about that do the Ain
[05:34:10] have any ability to read temper with or
[05:34:12] manipulate one's own or another's
[05:34:15] mind no does it
[05:34:20] matter do you love your family more than
[05:34:27] yourself
[05:34:29] yes all the Ain were killed in a
[05:34:32] massacre am i y who invited [ __ ] Oz
[05:34:38] no are you your Clan's sole
[05:34:45] survivor
[05:34:48] perhaps do you hate and wish to destroy
[05:34:52] this world with your own
[05:34:57] hands I don't
[05:35:00] know
[05:35:02] interesting now the final question
[05:35:08] can you swear that at this very moment
[05:35:11] the aventurine stone is safe and sound
[05:35:14] in this
[05:35:15] box
[05:35:23] [Music]
[05:35:27] huh of
[05:35:31] course looks like we can get an answer
[05:35:34] open it Mr
[05:35:36] aventurine it's your last chance to
[05:35:38] defend your honor wait if this guy can
[05:35:41] force you to tell the truth why don't
[05:35:42] you just [ __ ] just punch him just
[05:35:44] literally punch him before he can read
[05:35:45] your mind [ __ ] it he's probably not that
[05:35:48] strong welt has a black hole in his Cane
[05:35:51] the [ __ ] is he going to do against
[05:35:53] welt oo I have a family okay I have a
[05:35:55] [ __ ]
[05:35:58] sword plus your sister's dead plus ratio
[05:36:01] sorry that was [ __ ] what's up ratio
[05:36:03] please
[05:36:10] that was [ __ ] though I'm sorry I like
[05:36:12] Robin she's probably fine oh are these
[05:36:16] what you're looking
[05:36:30] for [ __ ] you how do you find those
[05:36:34] learned does this mean that you are
[05:36:36] willing to take the side of the family
[05:36:38] in this
[05:36:42] farce what makes you think you can
[05:36:45] convince
[05:36:47] me I've heard you haven't enjoyed Mr
[05:36:50] aventurine company I also understand
[05:36:53] that you're an avid learner who sees the
[05:36:56] pursuit of knowledge above
[05:36:58] all in that case you ought to realize
[05:37:02] that a competent scholar knows their
[05:37:04] position and wouldn't forsake more vital
[05:37:07] matters for the sake of petty Pride
[05:37:10] that's fair if you agree to assist the
[05:37:14] family I'll share our research findings
[05:37:17] on the stellon [ __ ] that's me
[05:37:19] just ask me aware that besides the
[05:37:22] family no other faction is willing to
[05:37:24] share such
[05:37:31] information cut to the chase what do you
[05:37:34] need from me
[05:37:39] I need Mr aventurine comprehensive what
[05:37:43] do you need for me I need your [ __ ]
[05:37:46] haven't you okay my fault
[05:37:48] Cornerstone you can't expect a
[05:37:51] featherless bird to take
[05:37:54] flight but I've also heard the 10 Elites
[05:37:57] in the Strategic investment Department
[05:37:59] have United progress why would you say
[05:38:02] that I'm sorry I'm
[05:38:05] sorry you'll have to speak more clearly
[05:38:08] than
[05:38:12] that the Cornerstone which Mr aventurine
[05:38:17] surrendered was it really his
[05:38:22] oh you question whether he would entrust
[05:38:25] you with someone else's
[05:38:28] Cornerstone the 10 stone hearts aren't
[05:38:30] as United as you think cornerstones are
[05:38:34] significantly more precious to them than
[05:38:37] their very own lives okay but you know
[05:38:41] that he's a crazed Gambler the more
[05:38:44] vocal he is about it the more cautious I
[05:38:46] must
[05:38:50] be I never imagined someone would share
[05:38:54] his way of
[05:38:55] thinking honestly you should see a
[05:38:59] shrink bring it the Box containing the
[05:39:03] Cornerstone is unique and only IPC
[05:39:07] senior staff and related members can
[05:39:09] access it but I happen to be among
[05:39:14] them
[05:39:23] okay I appreciate it okay here's my take
[05:39:26] Sunday whenever this [ __ ] comes out
[05:39:28] they're going to release a quest that's
[05:39:29] like sells the characters that are on
[05:39:31] the banner this one's going to make us
[05:39:32] like a venturine 2.2 is going to make us
[05:39:33] [ __ ] fall in love with like Robin
[05:39:35] then we're going to be like oh my God
[05:39:36] Firefly is so cool and and then Sunday
[05:39:38] right now he's kind of a dick like no
[05:39:39] one likes him but I feel like like
[05:39:40] they're going to make like a 2. [ __ ]
[05:39:41] five Quest be like wow look at how cool
[05:39:43] Sunday is actually he loves his family
[05:39:45] actually he's not wrong actually and
[05:39:47] then people like oh my God I I always
[05:39:48] like
[05:39:50] Sunday not my
[05:39:54] fault I like him ragy I mean his
[05:39:58] Design's all right but unfortunately
[05:40:00] your guess is correct
[05:40:08] the Golden
[05:40:09] Stone its color and glow are similar to
[05:40:12] that of kipo's
[05:40:16] body this is the very ruse he intends to
[05:40:20] use to fool you he won't reveal to you
[05:40:23] that the 10 ston Hearts chisel their own
[05:40:26] will into the
[05:40:27] cornerstones granting them an
[05:40:29] unparalleled r y why are you [ __ ]
[05:40:31] ratting him out and this Golden Stone is
[05:40:36] also known as a topaz not a venturine
[05:40:41] the [ __ ] topaz it belongs to Topaz
[05:40:47] yo so do you wish to confront him what
[05:40:52] the [ __ ] man not at the moment I'm more
[05:40:56] interested to know the location of his
[05:40:58] Cornerstone the safest place somewhere
[05:41:01] you'd never think of because he never
[05:41:04] intended to hide it in fact
[05:41:08] that Cornerstone has been in your hands
[05:41:11] from the very
[05:41:19] beginning I see this bag mixing a
[05:41:24] Cornerstone more precious than life
[05:41:26] itself with a bunch of worthless Jewels
[05:41:30] disguised as a gift of money waiting to
[05:41:32] be
[05:41:33] confiscated is indeed in line with Mr
[05:41:36] aventurin style y ratio what the [ __ ]
[05:41:39] are you doing then he makes up some
[05:41:41] trivial excuse downplaying the matter
[05:41:44] and requests the gift money this is a
[05:41:47] gamble one he's all too familiar with
[05:41:50] betting on your single misstep leading
[05:41:54] to a total loss learn it doctor I am
[05:41:58] grateful for your help the family will
[05:42:01] surely reward a righteous person like
[05:42:03] you as for the villain
[05:42:08] I hope he retreats in
[05:42:14] humiliation it was all thanks to your
[05:42:17] friend with a Keen Eye that I could add
[05:42:19] a blot of utter failure to your story
[05:42:22] [Music]
[05:42:23] career ratio you
[05:42:29] wret finally shown your true colors huh
[05:42:33] oh and just to remind you you currently
[05:42:36] only have have 17 system hours left to
[05:42:39] live treasure your remaining time and
[05:42:42] Savor The Delectable aftertaste of oh my
[05:42:44] God
[05:42:47] 17 you might as well explain yourself a
[05:42:49] little more
[05:42:51] clearly what I performed on you just now
[05:42:54] was the harmonies
[05:42:56] consecration you were to show Allegiance
[05:42:58] beneath the illumination of their Grace
[05:43:01] yet you acted willfully uttering nothing
[05:43:04] but falsehoods transforming ing the
[05:43:07] consecration into a
[05:43:09] trial I genuinely see no reason to
[05:43:12] absolve you from
[05:43:14] it is this what the harmony represents
[05:43:17] but is it built upon constraint and
[05:43:19] coercion
[05:43:22] yep you misunderstand Mr aventurine
[05:43:26] punishment is meant for the irreverent
[05:43:28] but I have seen your resilient Spirit
[05:43:31] I'm with sparle on this one i'mi [ __ ]
[05:43:34] Harmony
[05:43:40] throughout these 17 system hours you
[05:43:43] will be unable to escape the Dreamscape
[05:43:46] or contact any of your
[05:43:48] companions you only have two paths
[05:43:50] before you and it all depends on whether
[05:43:53] you can complete my test within the time
[05:43:55] limit should you succeed you will be
[05:43:58] able to coales into the Harmony and be
[05:44:02] with your
[05:44:03] family if you fail you will suffer the
[05:44:06] Wrath of the Eternal Centurion and fall
[05:44:10] into an abyss of
[05:44:15] Doom sounds like I'm going to end up the
[05:44:17] same either way I indeed do need a
[05:44:20] servant to help me uncover the evil
[05:44:22] hidden in the family from an external
[05:44:26] perspective I will Purge the evil from
[05:44:28] the inside and bring the real culprits
[05:44:31] to Justice within 17 system hours when
[05:44:35] the time comes compare your findings
[05:44:37] with mine if both our findings align or
[05:44:41] if you can provide me more insights then
[05:44:44] they will truly be able to Grant you
[05:44:47] mercy and honesty Shameless
[05:44:50] Hypocrites you took everything from me
[05:44:52] and still demand the truth that isn't
[05:44:56] fair your Carnival reeks with a stench
[05:44:58] of cash nothing is achievable without
[05:45:05] it this is meant to be an act of
[05:45:08] personal virtue not requiring the
[05:45:10] family's support your bag is over there
[05:45:14] do as you please I believe you can trade
[05:45:17] this bag of worthless Jewels for
[05:45:19] everything you need that's what gamblers
[05:45:22] excel at isn't
[05:45:26] it off you go Mr
[05:45:28] aventurine you are
[05:45:31] free I will wait here for your good news
[05:45:42] this meeting isn't an interrogation or a
[05:45:46] negotiation it's an outright
[05:45:50] execution why would I do that Mr
[05:45:52] aventurine I'm just wondering what a
[05:45:55] passer by who stumbled upon a scene of a
[05:45:57] murder could have found out that's
[05:46:02] all by the way before you go I have a
[05:46:06] person personal

[05:50:03] the iris family
[05:50:04] archives just as I thought
[05:50:08] I'd like to ask what kind of traces do
[05:50:11] people leave when they enter a dream are
[05:50:14] you referring to the records when
[05:50:18] you I apologize the yeah my bad dude
[05:50:22] it's an NVC is managed by The Blood
[05:50:24] Hound family we can only gain access if
[05:50:27] there's a problem looks like nothing can
[05:50:30] be found here at least we know who to
[05:50:32] look for next we can ask the blood hound
[05:50:35] family for information thank you for
[05:50:37] your assistance Miss Ali by the way is

[05:51:07] mysterious there's no information on her
[05:51:09] in the hotel system even if she's a
[05:51:12] stowaway she should have a disguised
[05:51:14] identity after entering the planet she's
[05:51:17] also in the running for the
[05:51:19] Legacy how is she going to sneak into
[05:51:21] the Dreamscape
[05:51:23] unnoticed is there any other way Wonder
[05:51:27] dream besides a dream pool the memoe
[05:51:31] keepers have abilities that are
[05:51:33] difficult for normal people to
[05:51:34] comprehend in the memory zone of penacon
[05:51:37] they Thrive effortlessly a fact proven
[05:51:40] to us by Black Swan the hacker girl from
[05:51:42] The stellon Hunters used extraordinary
[05:51:45] means to unlock the Dreamscape Hotel
[05:51:48] seal according to the scene witnessed by
[05:51:50] her it is likely that they are behind
[05:51:53] Miss Firefly's case The Garden of
[05:51:57] recollection and the stellon
[05:51:59] hunters both are possible but what about
[05:52:03] the

[05:59:20] judging from your tone it sounds like
[05:59:22] you were expecting
[05:59:24] us miss heo you're too polite there's no
[05:59:28] need to call me sir Mr Gallagher you
[05:59:32] even know my name of course I do you
[05:59:35] folks are from The Legend legendary
[05:59:36] astral Express and honorable guests of
[05:59:39] the
[05:59:40] watchmaker I had an encounter with this
[05:59:42] lady in the golden app I'm sorry for
[05:59:45] what happened to that
[05:59:48] kid this is also the reason why we've
[05:59:50] come to visit you Mr gallager the
[05:59:53] express can't just Overlook the death of
[05:59:55] that child so we've decided to help the
[05:59:58] family get to the bottom of it in the
[06:00:01] hopes of getting Justice for her the
[06:00:03] nameless involved with the family
[06:00:06] what an unpredictable twist of
[06:00:09] fate
[06:00:11] why what's wrong with the family no
[06:00:14] nothing march on pentacon everyone loves
[06:00:17] the family smile no matter how much one
[06:00:19] resists the beautiful dream when the
[06:00:21] time comes they too will find it hard to
[06:00:23] let go who wants to leave a warm Nest Mr
[06:00:27] Gallagher seems to be getting it
[06:00:29] something you got it wrong I'm not you
[06:00:33] want to discuss the case sure come with
[06:00:36] me okay this is not a good place to talk
[06:00:39] let's go
[06:00:40] elsewhere dude I feel like I ate too
[06:00:43] fast my [ __ ] stomach
[06:00:46] hurts even after that chilling tragedy
[06:00:49] they're still [ __ ] yapping still
[06:00:50] running effortlessly other than the
[06:00:53] family of the harmony it's hard to
[06:00:56] imagine any other power in the universe
[06:00:58] that could sustain a building of such
[06:01:00] magnitude the Family itself is a huge
[06:01:03] perfect building like
[06:01:06] a living Idol each member of the family
[06:01:09] sees themselves as a piece of the Divine
[06:01:11] puzzle revolving around a singular core
[06:01:14] and a shared
[06:01:15] ideal under their command they loyally
[06:01:18] fulfill their roles offering themselves
[06:01:21] while also receiving sustenance in
[06:01:23] return the harmony interesting analogy
[06:01:27] perhaps that's why penton's beautiful
[06:01:29] dream has persisted for so long but the
[06:01:33] human body has its limits and so does
[06:01:35] the divines that doesn't sound like the
[06:01:38] kind of comment a galaxy ranger would
[06:01:40] make just pointing out the facts Mr Yang
[06:01:44] will definitely have a better sense of
[06:01:45] what's going on the night why do you say
[06:01:48] that miss agaron the beautiful dream is
[06:01:52] crumbling but not because of a
[06:01:54] particular Eon a particular faction or a
[06:01:56] particular visitor that's collapse stems
[06:01:59] from a certain inevitability of human
[06:02:03] nature as people immerse their souls in
[06:02:05] the Dreamscape where consequences and
[06:02:08] pain cease to exist and only ease and
[06:02:11] pleasure Prevail they draw closer and
[06:02:14] closer
[06:02:15] necrosis what the [ __ ] is necrosis Bliss
[06:02:20] death looms as the
[06:02:23] necrosis also this necros that's body
[06:02:25] tissue spread one piece of the puzzle's
[06:02:28] mutation will eventually cause the
[06:02:30] entire building to shake
[06:02:32] break and crumble in the end the dreams
[06:02:37] that people built in the name of Freedom
[06:02:39] became the cage that imprisoned them I'm
[06:02:43] sure you've gained a lot from this trip
[06:02:45] Miss
[06:02:46] Aaron are you willing to share your
[06:02:49] findings with me of
[06:02:52] course that's if I
[06:02:55] remember she say as her hand gently rest
[06:02:57] on the hilt of the sword and then
[06:02:59] quickly let's go in the blink of an
[06:03:03] eye don't mind me it's just a habit
[06:03:06] going to events in the past I've become
[06:03:10] easily
[06:03:12] forgetful it's only when this sword is
[06:03:14] unshed that those hazy me start to
[06:03:17] become
[06:03:18] clearer take your
[06:03:21] time that should do it I vividly
[06:03:24] remember everything that occurred on
[06:03:26] pentacon ask
[06:03:33] away the moment of Daybreak
[06:03:36] I've heard that's where the dawn Factory
[06:03:38] which processes the foundation of the
[06:03:40] Dreamscape is located behind the
[06:03:42] Dreamscape song and dance and many
[06:03:45] imagination
[06:03:46] factories workers create all kinds of
[06:03:49] whimsical Works day in and day out in
[06:03:51] their dreams and they return they say it
[06:03:53] will suffice there I encountered a young
[06:03:56] woman who had just come of age the
[06:03:58] perfect time to indulge in beautiful
[06:04:01] dreams her greatest wish was to one day
[06:04:04] move to the Goen hour
[06:04:06] and see the Magnificent garments she had
[06:04:08] woven with her own hands for certain
[06:04:10] reasons her wish was difficult to
[06:04:15] fulfill but I managed to bring her a
[06:04:19] garment huh guilded hour it yes it is a
[06:04:25] everyone there is exquisitly brasted and
[06:04:27] always I've never met anyone who was
[06:04:29] willing to talk I could only stand at
[06:04:31] the crossroads watching crowds I they
[06:04:34] would open kind of care about [ __ ]
[06:04:36] gilded hour moment of dusk of luxury and
[06:04:41] consumerism then you all must have seen
[06:04:43] those who are attempting to realize
[06:04:45] their
[06:04:46] dreams or have realized
[06:04:48] [Music]
[06:04:50] them himself tatron had been auctioned
[06:04:53] off a dozen times this time around there
[06:04:55] were no successful all right this is
[06:04:58] what I've seen and heard along the way
[06:05:00] so tldr pentony
[06:05:04] aware someone wants said to me penacon
[06:05:08] wasn't like this a long time ago nor
[06:05:11] should it be I've traveled through the
[06:05:13] reality and Dreamscape of the planet of
[06:05:15] festivities okay watched the tides of
[06:05:18] night rise and fall okay when time
[06:05:20] stopped for people
[06:05:22] okay where the spirits of the Rich and
[06:05:26] impoverished remain forever fixed on
[06:05:28] their own
[06:05:30] scales this is why I think the collapse
[06:05:32] of the beautiful dream
[06:05:35] is
[06:05:36] inevitable there might be a way to
[06:05:39] change everything this changes
[06:05:41] everything call mtashed but if this is
[06:05:44] indeed the world that people desire wait
[06:05:47] if this is precisely why life chooses to
[06:05:51] Slumber should we still seek to change
[06:05:57] it me too El Miss acaron now it's my
[06:06:02] turn to share a story with
[06:06:04] you when I was a boy from my homeland
[06:06:08] who at a time when the world was
[06:06:10] grappling with deep unhealable pain made
[06:06:15] a choice he wo together the dreams of
[06:06:19] everyone in the world linking people's
[06:06:22] Dreamscapes and shouldered this burden
[06:06:25] himself from this he created a giant uh
[06:06:30] spiritual
[06:06:32] Adam the [ __ ] is Adam the giant stood
[06:06:35] Between Heaven and Earth becoming the
[06:06:38] pillar of the world's existence as a
[06:06:41] price those who found it hard to move
[06:06:44] forward who could not Advance forever
[06:06:48] lost their future they slumbered in a
[06:06:52] dream devoid of disaster and pain living
[06:06:56] out their days peacefully in the man's
[06:06:59] created Utopia and it is because of the
[06:07:03] wishes of those people who wished not to
[06:07:05] awaken that this spiritual atom became
[06:07:11] unbreakable and yet you stand here right
[06:07:14] now which also
[06:07:16] means that man
[06:07:20] failed because people must always move
[06:07:23] towards the future even if human
[06:07:26] weaknesses make them pause when they
[06:07:28] truly cannot move forward Humanity will
[06:07:32] eventually seek a way to save itself and
[06:07:36] that man he was never a failure like
[06:07:41] everyone in that world he etched the
[06:07:44] possibilities of human nature into his
[06:07:47] heart he was the sunchaser of Legend
[06:07:51] soaring towards the sky and embracing
[06:07:55] his final Victory with his
[06:07:57] fall I'm okay well sended to Heights
[06:08:00] Uncharted only to come face to face with
[06:08:03] the Sun a place not visited by by anyone
[06:08:06] before his wings would melt because of
[06:08:10] it only for him to fall into the sea and
[06:08:13] after
[06:08:14] that countless others would surpass him
[06:08:18] soaring to even greater
[06:08:23] Heights A fitting metaphor for the
[06:08:25] nameless is trailblazing spirit thank
[06:08:28] you Mr Yang I know what you wish to
[06:08:31] confirm the universe has innumerable
[06:08:34] similar yet different
[06:08:37] worlds in these worlds there are
[06:08:39] innumerable people who look alike yet
[06:08:43] don't I too have embarked on Journeys
[06:08:46] encountering old friends with familiar
[06:08:48] faces on different worlds s witnessing
[06:08:51] their Destinies follow paths similar to
[06:08:54] mine so I will tell you even if not
[06:08:59] completely
[06:09:01] similar the story you just told
[06:09:06] it overlaps with my
[06:09:08] past and within that Abyssal
[06:09:11] dream I ended that man's life
[06:09:17] [Music]
[06:09:21] yo I am not who you think I
[06:09:23] am nor will my home be as fortunate as
[06:09:26] your
[06:09:28] world I am sorry it's fine I don't mind
[06:09:33] so long as I can alleviate your susp
[06:09:37] there's something I still wish to know
[06:09:39] Miss
[06:09:40] acaron under that representation of the
[06:09:43] hunt exactly what sort of power is it
[06:09:48] that has motivated your solitary Journey
[06:09:51] thus
[06:09:53] far Mr Yang before answering that
[06:09:57] question I wish to continue the previous
[06:10:02] topic I like your analogy very much
[06:10:05] indeed birds are born to fly D what are
[06:10:08] you but in a distant past their
[06:10:10] ancestors could only gaze at the sky in
[06:10:13] Envy they saw that far away ray of light
[06:10:16] from above the heavens piercing through
[06:10:18] the clouds and blanketing the
[06:10:21] Earth and so time and time again
[06:10:23] generation after generation the birds
[06:10:26] spread their wings and took to the sky
[06:10:29] attempting to touch its
[06:10:31] ceiling all because the sun was there
[06:10:35] then what if the last bird finally
[06:10:38] Soares into the sky only to realize that
[06:10:42] the end of the light is not the Sun but
[06:10:45] Darkness all consuming black
[06:10:48] hole the
[06:10:49] [ __ ] then why
[06:10:53] exactly do we even walk towards the
[06:11:00] light oh it's this part
[06:11:11] huh long time no see having fun on
[06:11:15] Penton Aaron this guy sounds extra
[06:11:18] American this voice is this [ __ ] boot

[06:11:27] what you are what you up to I don't know
[06:11:30] maybe my bullets will find you oh I
[06:11:33] guess it is bullets until then you best
[06:11:35] find a casket store on panone and ask
[06:11:37] the owner to reserve a good quality
[06:11:39] casket for you

[06:11:55] mistake who the [ __ ] okay that's

[06:13:57] POV you look pale or is that also part
[06:14:03] of your act

[06:14:08] show yourself yeah [ __ ] you Rachel I
[06:14:10] thought this was exactly what you wanted

[06:43:44] atmosphere Master technique and spin a
[06:43:47] tale of mystery in anticipation true
[06:43:50] Giger my go only then can a perfect

[06:44:12] ingredients together you have to capture
[06:44:13] the it and then he's like it's luck how
[06:44:15] the [ __ ] is any of this luck
[06:44:23] sorry wait whoa whoa no heo hey look at
[06:44:27] all these chips everywhere a few days
[06:44:30] ago an actor from the iris family came
[06:44:33] caused a Ruckus for Siobhan those chips
[06:44:36] must have gotten scattered during all
[06:44:38] the
[06:44:41] chaos that's a clever metaphor that
[06:44:44] being said opening a bar in this place
[06:44:48] filled with monsters it's quite a feed
[06:44:51] Siobhan must have a lot of tricks up her
[06:44:53] sleeve right you'll have to ask her
[06:44:55] yourself to find out but I have a
[06:44:58] feeling she won't budge unless you

[06:45:23] Soul glad in this bar that is
[06:45:26] interesting tender Pride it wouldn't

[06:48:02] [Music]
[06:48:04] I've seen it the moment when Siobhan and
[06:48:08] I share the stage what do you mean by
[06:48:11] that the crowd is going wild Applause
[06:48:15] crashing like waves the aroma of irises

[06:48:22] ribbons dancing around us I've seen that
[06:48:26] scene countless times in my dreams and
[06:48:30] every time it mesmerizes me
[06:48:34] that's why I have to bring her back to
[06:48:38] that world no matter what it
[06:48:42] takes want to raise a glass my attentive
[06:48:46] listener interesting dream you

[06:49:21] I'm too
[06:49:22] timid and
[06:49:24] shy Longing To Shine but afraid of
[06:49:27] stepping into the
[06:49:29] spotlight I need her guidance
[06:49:32] because I'll never be able to do
[06:49:36] anything alone true you don't know
[06:49:39] Siobhan's past and you have no clue
[06:49:44] how radiant she used to be she was a
[06:49:48] radi I know she probably thinks I'm just
[06:49:53] trying to ride her Fame to get
[06:49:57] ahead but all I want is for her to
[06:50:01] reclaim her place

[06:50:22] don't those darn Irish
[06:50:27] jerks I get it now she's not leaving

[06:50:41] I can do her a
[06:50:43] favor I'll write a letter who oh she's
[06:50:46] going to write a letter talking to you
[06:50:49] has got me feeling a bit
[06:50:51] down my thoughts are
[06:50:53] swirling making my mind
[06:50:56] clear and bringing tears to my
[06:51:00] eyes Maybe
[06:51:03] I
[06:51:04] should find a place to reflect on what
[06:51:08] sioban truly means to
[06:51:11] meage here's the payment for the
[06:51:14] drinks please pass it on to her he has
[06:51:19] left that's good for
[06:51:22] her radiant dreams may be enticing but
[06:51:25] they're nothing more than
[06:51:28] dreams her drink is on the
[06:51:30] house please keep money bro she gave the
[06:51:33] money to you why would you keep why
[06:51:35] would you tell me to keep it what did I
[06:51:36] do I can tell he's itching to show off
[06:51:39] his
[06:51:41] skills Gallagher's going to make me a
[06:51:42] drink flush hello Gallagher that being
[06:51:45] said mixing a drink is way simpler than
[06:51:48] you to imagine just pick your favorite
[06:51:50] ingredients toss them in a glass mix it
[06:51:53] up and it's done so go ahead explore the
[06:51:56] bar and bring me any ingredients you
[06:51:58] prefer sir yes sir nice work let me you
[06:52:02] found some interesting ingredients there
[06:52:05] now each drink has its own flavor and
[06:52:08] the base ingredient sets the tone for
[06:52:10] the initial taste and the lingering
[06:52:13] aftertaste so which one would you like
[06:52:15] to use as the
[06:52:18] base well I only have two [ __ ] Soul glad
[06:52:20] all my homies hate Soul glad Pika the
[06:52:23] original formula is said to be a nuno's
[06:52:26] favorite drink it's sour and bitter and
[06:52:30] the bubbles burst in your throat like
[06:52:32] swallowing Rusty chains evoking thoughts
[06:52:36] of Dungeons and
[06:52:37] prisons now that you've chosen the base
[06:52:40] it's time to pick the adjunct the
[06:52:43] ingredient that'll create a marvelous
[06:52:45] chemical reaction with the base it
[06:52:47] should give an unforgettable taste
[06:52:49] without overpowering the main tone so uh
[06:52:54] let's do Eternal endurance taste is not
[06:52:57] very intense yet evocative after those
[06:53:01] despicables sent m away M I found myself
[06:53:04] lost in the wilderness of my
[06:53:06] dreams they say that even the dirt here
[06:53:09] oozes was
[06:53:12] sweetness all I tasted was stoic
[06:53:15] bitterness
[06:53:18] male almost there let's make a
[06:53:20] decoration which style do you prefer
[06:53:22] anything you need I've got
[06:53:24] it hu a symbol of bravery and
[06:53:28] dauntlessness may you break free from
[06:53:30] your shackles just like he did
[06:53:34] well it's
[06:53:37] done Here's to You Trailblazer kind
[06:53:41] Blass of even the
[06:53:42] wicked to the sad
[06:53:47] truth well done Gallagher you're not
[06:53:50] over the hill
[06:53:51] yet so are you
[06:53:55] satisfied the
[06:53:57] flavors the richness and layers of these
[06:54:00] flavors are a masterpiece especially
[06:54:03] with the ajun I can taste the spicy and
[06:54:06] sour notes with a hint of
[06:54:11] sweetness I'm not entirely sure what it
[06:54:14] all means maybe Mr Gallagher can shed
[06:54:17] some light on
[06:54:18] it well if you're expecting a profound
[06:54:21] answer I'm afraid I'll disappoint
[06:54:24] you the imagery it implies is pretty
[06:54:27] straightforward it's just a glimpse of
[06:54:30] what this dream truly tastes like like
[06:54:33] nothing
[06:54:34] more does this true taste have anything
[06:54:38] to do with that
[06:54:40] M male I've heard this name in my dreams
[06:54:44] yeah that name does sound
[06:54:47] familiar when got knocked out by that
[06:54:49] massed fool girl I think I heard someone
[06:54:52] calling that name do you
[06:54:59] remember I was right about you you you
[06:55:02] guys seem to know quite a bit and now
[06:55:04] there's no reason to hide anything from
[06:55:06] you
[06:55:08] anymore let's dig deeper into the case
[06:55:11] and of course I'll tell you a story
[06:55:13] about
[06:55:16] male all right let's start with what we
[06:55:19] know based on the clues the family has
[06:55:22] it seems that Firefly isn't a local or
[06:55:24] an invited guest we that other words
[06:55:28] she's a
[06:55:29] stowaway she managed to fool me at first
[06:55:33] my age must be getting the best of me
[06:55:35] but here on the planet of festivities
[06:55:37] Stow ways are a common sight you're
[06:55:40] bound to run into one sooner or later
[06:55:43] after the incident the hounds wasted no
[06:55:45] time searching for that girl in both the
[06:55:47] Dreamscape and
[06:55:49] reality but here's the thing we only
[06:55:52] reive bad news and the tricky is kind at
[06:55:55] that she simply vanished leaving no
[06:55:58] Trace in the Dreamscape or reality as if
[06:56:01] she had never come to pentacon at
[06:56:04] all huh does that
[06:56:11] mean is she a ghost a clever metaphor um
[06:56:16] you you were making a metaphor
[06:56:18] right let me be frank this case
[06:56:23] actually is unlike anything the blood
[06:56:25] hound family has dealt with before dealt
[06:56:28] with before so death does happen in
[06:56:33] pentacon if I understand
[06:56:35] correctly you've witnessed it so there's
[06:56:38] no need to hide even the shinus city has
[06:56:40] its dark side we're all adults here
[06:56:44] surely I don't need to explain too much
[06:56:45] to you we're all adults here and then
[06:56:47] there's Mar family based on that alone
[06:56:50] would be naive death may occur in sweet
[06:56:53] dreams so what such events are highly
[06:56:56] unlikely and only affect a tiny number
[06:56:58] of
[06:56:59] people if you really want to tell people
[06:57:02] into this case you need to understand
[06:57:04] the true problem with the
[06:57:07] family what's the problem gager guess
[06:57:09] it's time to tell the story of that M I
[06:57:12] assume Mel is the like older Misha we
[06:57:14] saw in the ly cone cuz Mel and Misha are
[06:57:16] the same [ __ ] name Russia lore I
[06:57:18] think very perceptive I don't [ __ ]
[06:57:20] know the astral Express has received
[06:57:22] that music box too right do you know the
[06:57:25] secrets it
[06:57:26] holds there's a
[06:57:28] message witness The Impossible in the
[06:57:32] realm of Dreams find the legacy of the
[06:57:36] watchmaker father of
[06:57:38] pentacon and thus the answer to the
[06:57:41] question wait where was the message on
[06:57:44] the music
[06:57:45] box why does life Slumber why does life
[06:57:50] Slumber that's the exact how does he go
[06:57:52] how does she memorize all of it hey why
[06:57:54] are you
[06:57:56] laughing wait did you write it no but
[06:58:00] I'm the officer in charge of this case
[06:58:02] so how could I not know I'm sure you
[06:58:05] must have noticed that this message
[06:58:07] didn't come from the family you might
[06:58:09] have even guessed that the relationship
[06:58:11] between the family and the watchmaker
[06:58:14] isn't as close as it seems I did notice
[06:58:17] that actually just our
[06:58:19] speculation actually it's hard to
[06:58:22] believe that the father of pentacon and
[06:58:25] its actual managers are at
[06:58:27] odds now I can assure you that your
[06:58:30] speculation is absolutely correct
[06:58:33] the family is considered the watchmaker
[06:58:35] an enemy for a long time so so Mel and
[06:58:38] Sunday are beefing and then Sunday was
[06:58:39] like [ __ ] you die he seems to be living
[06:58:42] only so he kidnapped his son Misha
[06:58:44] stories
[06:58:45] he and now Misha is the hotel servants
[06:58:48] wondered why the family allowed the
[06:58:50] watchmaker to send out such a ridiculous
[06:58:53] message to the outside world inviting
[06:58:55] you here and causing
[06:58:57] chaos so you want to seize this
[06:59:01] opportunity to to expose the
[06:59:04] watchmaker well now you understand why
[06:59:07] the oak family authorized the nameless
[06:59:10] to assist in the investigation but kept
[06:59:12] you in the dark
[06:59:14] right because the watchmaker is not the
[06:59:17] legend of the land of the dreams at all
[06:59:20] he's the most shameful stain in the
[06:59:22] history of pone and he's the root cause
[06:59:25] of all the anomalies in the
[06:59:28] Dreamscape what that to do with male you
[06:59:31] don't get it
[06:59:32] well I mean he's the watch maker kale
[06:59:36] the betray I [ __ ] knew it [ __ ] too
[06:59:39] easy it's [ __ ] too
[06:59:41] easy it's [ __ ] too
[06:59:44] easy dude cuz I was telling you Meek
[06:59:47] Shaw looks too sus to just be a random
[06:59:48] ass NPC and male and Misha are the same
[06:59:51] name cuz I I watched a video about M
[06:59:53] tall the chess player and then Levy or
[06:59:56] Levi was like yo it's [ __ ]
[06:59:59] Misha I don't know wait aren't we
[07:00:01] supposed to be discussing the watch
[07:00:03] maker I would have expected you to take
[07:00:05] us to maybe a library or an archive room
[07:00:09] of sorts but an amusement
[07:00:12] park the culture of a city reflects its
[07:00:15] history in the most authentic way to you
[07:00:19] it's a fun place but to me it's a prison
[07:00:22] for the planet's past you know that
[07:00:25] pentacon used to be the ipc's prison
[07:00:27] planet right all the prisoners were
[07:00:30] brought here helping the Garden of
[07:00:32] recollection salvaged the leaking
[07:00:34] Memoria from the
[07:00:36] macrovoid the prolonged exposure to high
[07:00:39] concentrations of Memoria caused a
[07:00:41] unique
[07:00:42] phenomenon the dreams of countless
[07:00:45] prisoners intersected and overlapped and
[07:00:48] people started meeting each other in
[07:00:50] their dreams living lives that were
[07:00:52] almost identical to
[07:00:55] reality but everything has a price and
[07:00:58] sweet dreams are no exception in the end
[07:01:01] the dream world was unable to alleviate
[07:01:03] the suffering of prisoners in reality
[07:01:06] one of the prisoners Broke Free from the
[07:01:08] IPC shackles and fought for
[07:01:11] freedom he is
[07:01:14] hanu my god of dreamville the Great
[07:01:17] Peacemaker hu the goat faithful
[07:01:19] companion of The
[07:01:21] Underdogs cool grunting
[07:01:24] noises so the character Han is based on
[07:01:26] a real life person history is always
[07:01:30] WR however it's undeniable that Clocky
[07:01:33] is an animation that draws from penton's
[07:01:35] actual
[07:01:37] history these characters not only exist
[07:01:39] in dreamville but also in the distant
[07:01:42] past once you realize this you'll
[07:01:46] understand why we're
[07:01:48] here wait
[07:01:50] what there are so many members of The
[07:01:53] Blood Hound family around
[07:01:55] here they just received a lockdown order
[07:01:58] supposedly from Sunday himself who knows
[07:02:02] what it's
[07:02:04] for
[07:02:05] [ __ ] H so many of
[07:02:09] them I've never seen anything like this
[07:02:12] even when they're tracking down
[07:02:13] [Music]
[07:02:15] suspects we don't need to go in we don't
[07:02:18] want to draw any unwanted attention
[07:02:20] inside we can just talk here let's find
[07:02:22] a quiet spot and continue our
[07:02:24] conversation sir yes
[07:02:26] sir view here is great right including
[07:02:29] Clocky if all the characters in the
[07:02:32] animation are based on characters in
[07:02:36] reality then clock's counterpart is
[07:02:39] definitely the
[07:02:40] watchmaker in the animation he's hu's
[07:02:44] partner and one of the founders of
[07:02:46] dreamville does that mean the watch
[07:02:49] maker was personally involved in that
[07:02:51] war and sided with asdon oh yes it was a
[07:02:55] Monumental War for Freedom hunu fought
[07:02:58] alongside a motly crew of massed fools
[07:03:02] nameless history fictionalists mourning
[07:03:06] actors Omen
[07:03:08] vanguards even visitors from Beyond the
[07:03:11] sky in the end they emerged Victorious
[07:03:15] among them was the person who would
[07:03:16] eventually be known as the
[07:03:19] watchmaker but if you do the math
[07:03:22] doesn't that mean the watchmaker was
[07:03:24] around for several centuries how is
[07:03:27] march doing the one doing the math I'm
[07:03:28] not sure but male was already the
[07:03:31] watchmaker when I met him so maybe he
[07:03:33] inherited the
[07:03:35] title how old are you now Mr
[07:03:40] Officer I'm 13 okay all right no way not
[07:03:45] even
[07:03:46] close hunu freed the frontier prison but
[07:03:50] peace still eluded him with limited
[07:03:53] resources why outside world and internal
[07:03:57] conflicts between major prison districts
[07:03:59] the future of ozano was uncertain he's a
[07:04:02] juicer it wasn't until the watch maker
[07:04:05] approached the family with the idea of
[07:04:07] turning the prison into the planet of
[07:04:09] festivities that pentacon finally gained
[07:04:12] its name and
[07:04:14] Glory thus he became known as the father
[07:04:18] of
[07:04:19] pentacon take back what he said about
[07:04:21] his M he's not [ __ ] 13 family he's a
[07:04:25] bartender said you were His companion so
[07:04:28] that means
[07:04:30] you no
[07:04:32] I'm Not His
[07:04:34] companion but rather one of his many
[07:04:37] children but I am indeed a
[07:04:40] traitor not to the
[07:04:42] family but to the [ __ ]
[07:04:46] M what did you do
[07:04:50] uhoh I did nothing and that's the worst
[07:04:54] betrayal of
[07:04:55] all just like you I had close
[07:04:58] companions we dedicated ourselves to pen
[07:05:01] Tony but the oak family they set us
[07:05:05] up male was too old to protect his
[07:05:09] children anymore so we left the family
[07:05:12] to find our own path we were branded
[07:05:15] traitors children it's literally mea
[07:05:18] even though the true Traders were
[07:05:19] someone
[07:05:20] else while they continue to praise the
[07:05:23] watchmaker's name in the World Behind
[07:05:25] Closed Doors they condemn him on a
[07:05:28] pillar of
[07:05:29] Shame nevertheless we wanted to clear
[07:05:32] his name we intended to find the real
[07:05:35] traitor the one responsible for all this
[07:05:38] and restore Harmony to pentacon but we
[07:05:42] failed too much time had passed and the
[07:05:45] land of the dreams had become deeply
[07:05:48] corrupted after countless fruitless
[07:05:51] Pursuits I gave
[07:05:54] up like a lost dog the family accepted
[07:05:58] me and made me an officer supposedly as
[07:06:01] a form of
[07:06:02] forgiveness but it was actually a
[07:06:05] punishment since then I've been
[07:06:07] completely cut off from my partners and
[07:06:10] my
[07:06:11] past as for
[07:06:13] male I heard he died in obscurity in a
[07:06:17] place where no one could find
[07:06:19] him that's when I realized that the
[07:06:22] pentacon I once knew would never return
[07:06:26] we're truly sorry for what
[07:06:28] happened but this is not the end of
[07:06:31] theory story
[07:06:33] right H apparently someone has inherited
[07:06:38] the title of the watchmaker and has been
[07:06:40] secretly working against the family all
[07:06:42] this
[07:06:46] time that's my goat un fortunately after
[07:06:49] all these years I have no idea who that
[07:06:52] person is or if they're even
[07:06:55] real is Misha maybe not I don't [ __ ]
[07:06:58] know but they have the same name I just
[07:07:00] have one lead I'm going on the one lead
[07:07:03] you I'm I'm [ __ ] aventurine I'm going
[07:07:06] all in because I believe the girl's
[07:07:08] death must be connected to the
[07:07:09] watchmaker's Legacy and at the end of
[07:07:12] all these Mysteries we will find the
[07:07:14] answers we are seeking if it really is
[07:07:17] male's ghost I want to meet
[07:07:21] him if only for the last
[07:07:24] time for those who despise me could form
[07:07:26] a line from here all the way to the
[07:07:28] entrance of the hotel but those willing
[07:07:31] to look me in the eye and hear me
[07:07:33] out let's just say there won't be many
[07:07:37] I've told you all I know is a sign of
[07:07:40] gratitude thank you for listening to
[07:07:42] this old dog bark and all H uh something
[07:07:47] just happened at the theme park
[07:07:49] SS now if you'll excuse me good luck to
[07:07:53] all of you how
[07:07:55] ironic what's so different between the
[07:07:57] Stow ways rejected by pentacon today and
[07:08:01] the dreamseekers once hailed as Pioneers
[07:08:04] several Amber eras
[07:08:08] ago Gallagher does have a troubled past
[07:08:12] it seems while Firefly's whereabouts
[07:08:15] remain a mystery his stories shed light
[07:08:18] on our suspicions about the true
[07:08:20] identity of the watchmaker his
[07:08:22] connection to the family and the power
[07:08:25] struggles hidden behind sweet dreams and
[07:08:29] death all that the family isn't all oh
[07:08:32] and that the family isn't all United as
[07:08:34] one and that death is related to the
[07:08:36] watchmaker and that Clocky is based on
[07:08:38] the
[07:08:40] watchmaker
[07:08:42] exactly Gallagher suggests that the real
[07:08:45] traitor is someone else that lines up
[07:08:48] with what we've gathered so far Firefly
[07:08:51] got involved in this mess because of the
[07:08:53] Legacy and now we're sure that a
[07:08:55] venturine accusations against acaron are
[07:08:58] baseless
[07:09:01] H you're really into Clocky huh speaking
[07:09:04] of which that Clocky who only reveals
[07:09:07] himself to you is quite
[07:09:09] intriguing it's a shame we've never met
[07:09:11] him since then okay now that we've
[07:09:14] confirmed a lot of our suspicions let's
[07:09:16] take a moment to think about the clues
[07:09:18] we have send a message to welt and see
[07:09:21] how things are going on his
[07:09:27] end oh can I ask a dumb question I feel
[07:09:29] like I should know this by now cuz they
[07:09:31] mentioned it like 26 times but who the
[07:09:33] [ __ ] is the oat family no spoilers pass
[07:09:35] what we know right now Sunday oh his
[07:09:39] last name is oat Sunday oat that's your
[07:09:41] [ __ ] name what a [ __ ] loser Sunday
[07:09:47] oat oh Oak that's even worse got my
[07:09:52] Sunday
[07:09:54] Oak uh not too
[07:09:56] bad she's on our side yeah you [ __ ]
[07:09:59] yapped with Aaron yeah went for like at
[07:10:03] drinks Oak Sunday are your companions
[07:10:06] worried about you they're just checking
[07:10:09] up on me let's get in and get out seems
[07:10:12] they've made some progress looks like
[07:10:14] we're about to enter the depths of d
[07:10:16] light Prevail oh I know this place it's
[07:10:18] been a smooth ride uhoh almost too
[07:10:20] smooth for a heavily guarded I mean Aron
[07:10:22] clears all these [ __ ] NPCs let see if
[07:10:25] there's anyone waiting to greet us and
[07:10:27] lore wel is [ __ ] broken
[07:10:38] something feels off a Grand Mansion like
[07:10:41] this and not a butler or servant in
[07:10:43] sight this door is open looks like what
[07:10:46] just one
[07:10:47] moment just one moment acon draws her
[07:10:50] blade slightly within a moment her
[07:10:52] breath becomes
[07:10:54] impers I've made myself less
[07:10:57] noticeable the crew can explain their
[07:10:59] presence as authorized by the family but
[07:11:02] I can't come up with any excuses for
[07:11:03] being
[07:11:04] here I see what an interesting
[07:11:12] technique transformation using Arron's
[07:11:14] okay I know what [ __ ] Arron's
[07:11:16] technique does
[07:11:18] buddy the model in the sand pit it's the
[07:11:22] golden hour the footprints here are
[07:11:24] different from the
[07:11:26] rest two sets
[07:11:29] of looks like Outsiders passed through
[07:11:32] here not long
[07:11:36] ago well there aren't any people in this
[07:11:39] Mansion they've quite a few mtic guards
[07:11:42] to patrol this place
[07:11:45] oh okay I guess I can't technique that
[07:11:48] all together uh I don't know about this
[07:11:50] team C though
[07:11:54] [Music]
[07:12:03] spend
[07:12:04] freely free will or what destined for
[07:12:11] Oblivion sorry look it dropped something
[07:12:14] a
[07:12:15] note looks like instructions from the
[07:12:17] butler for the other
[07:12:19] servants seems like the mansion's entire
[07:12:22] Workforce were assigned other tasks
[07:12:24] before Robin's death it must have been a
[07:12:27] big project to require that much
[07:12:29] Manpower
[07:12:31] the Charmy Festival perhaps but no
[07:12:35] matter what their main priorities are
[07:12:37] there should always be someone left at
[07:12:39] the Mansion right so you're saying
[07:12:43] someone deliberate yeah it's a setup
[07:12:45] yeah but I don't know why it's the
[07:12:54] Trap stream
[07:12:58] foran no one here either there's a the
[07:13:01] chest get the get the chest since no
[07:13:02] one's around to entertain us let's make
[07:13:04] ourselves at
[07:13:07] home
[07:13:11] chest dear brother a letter from Robin
[07:13:13] how are you doing these days I intended
[07:13:14] to visit you uh my turn but with the
[07:13:17] approaching TR Festival in your busy
[07:13:18] schedule I refrain from troubling you
[07:13:20] urgent matter my depend of experience
[07:13:22] dude
[07:13:23] Jesus um peuli change my
[07:13:26] [Music]
[07:13:28] voice my voice worsened over time and I
[07:13:30] even EXP periods of complete voice loss
[07:13:33] investigations a Discord lurking within
[07:13:36] us tainted my voice of Harmony I
[07:13:38] immediately realized that such levels of
[07:13:39] interference can only occur if either a
[07:13:41] powerful external force is pulling the
[07:13:42] strings or if a senior member of the
[07:13:44] family is involved unfortunately uh
[07:13:46] latter conclusion which means a member
[07:13:47] of the family is involved extremely
[07:13:49] alarming Discovery a traitor has emerged
[07:13:51] within the family it's highly likely
[07:13:52] that that one person is one of the four
[07:13:54] family heads I trust you implicitly dear
[07:13:55] brother with because of our promise
[07:13:57] within the Horizon I feel this person
[07:13:59] intends to impede its progress or even
[07:14:01] the festival for some ulterior motive
[07:14:04] learn about the memories Z death Meme
[07:14:05] and further inquiries believe that the
[07:14:07] culprit who directed it to cause the
[07:14:08] series of incidents is likely the afor
[07:14:11] mentioned traitor in the family given
[07:14:13] your heavy workload please take care of
[07:14:14] yourself Tarts strawberries size and
[07:14:18] sweetness merang cream cracknels from
[07:14:23] media May Zee be with us Robin as soon
[07:14:27] as I and the rest of the crew arrived in
[07:14:29] pentacon Mr Sunday and and Robin showed
[07:14:32] up to greet us I remember hearing
[07:14:35] something unusual in her voice TR family
[07:14:39] is one of the foreheads Harmony had been
[07:14:41] tampered with
[07:14:42] somehow but as far as I know there
[07:14:45] aren't many entities capable of
[07:14:47] interfering with the power of paths
[07:14:50] meaning if there really is that I didn't
[07:14:52] mean I didn't mean to is there really is
[07:14:54] a TR of the family the person must hold
[07:14:56] a high position or possess right Sunday
[07:14:59] has been having such difficulty in in
[07:15:01] the
[07:15:02] traitor there's an impostor Among
[07:15:07] Us bro are you
[07:15:09] [Music]
[07:15:24] [ __ ] the information about Robin
[07:15:27] Firefly and the other
[07:15:29] victims I I don't see any commonalities
[07:15:32] among them looks like the rumor rumors
[07:15:35] were right death does seem to be
[07:15:38] targeting random victims and based on
[07:15:41] Sunday's
[07:15:42] notes he's no stranger to death he's
[07:15:45] just surprised that it has research Let
[07:15:47] Me Wait wait can I reopen it wait wait
[07:15:48] let me reop no no no let me let me no no
[07:15:51] let me no let me look at it again oh my
[07:15:55] can I not look at it again hello can I
[07:15:57] not open it
[07:15:59] again did
[07:16:02] out this light
[07:16:05] cone is securely
[07:16:07] guarded it must hold some important
[07:16:10] memories baby suay according to Robin's
[07:16:12] interview despite having performed on so
[07:16:15] many Grand stages her favorite
[07:16:19] performance was a a pretend show she put
[07:16:22] on with her brother when they were just
[07:16:25] kids I wonder how their relationship
[07:16:27] what if Sunday okay disclaimer mute the
[07:16:29] stream right now cuz there's no way this
[07:16:31] is really what happened what if Sunday
[07:16:33] was like you know what sister I'm such a
[07:16:35] like big fan of yours that no one else
[07:16:36] should be able to hear your voice so he
[07:16:38] like removed her voice and was like now
[07:16:40] no one else can hear your voice that
[07:16:42] didn't happen I'm sorry there's a
[07:16:43] traitor it's not him growing up brings
[07:16:45] gains but SL
[07:16:48] losses yeah time is a way of smoothing
[07:16:51] things out or is it dreams of Youth will
[07:16:56] eventually Fade
[07:16:57] Away wait can I not reopen this [ __ ]
[07:17:00] okay GG
[07:17:02] to Sunday from a letter from
[07:17:05] Alfalfa that's not their name Alf Alpha
[07:17:08] oh wait it is um I've been informed
[07:17:10] about Robin and I why is alpha alpha
[07:17:12] funny I would like to express my deest
[07:17:14] condolences I must remind
[07:17:18] you you now hold the position of not
[07:17:20] only her elder brother but also the head
[07:17:21] of the oak
[07:17:24] family critical
[07:17:26] period
[07:17:28] death while you convin that death is Con
[07:17:30] connected to the watchmaker I've met the
[07:17:32] watchmaker many times long before the
[07:17:33] dream master adopted you and your sister
[07:17:35] dream master adopted them and I have
[07:17:37] never found any evidence linking him to
[07:17:38] the memory Zone meme now that you are
[07:17:40] the head of the oak family it's
[07:17:41] essential that you assess the situation
[07:17:42] objectively and consider the bigger
[07:17:44] picture it is unwise to allocate all of
[07:17:46] ped's resources and Manpower for the
[07:17:47] sake of a personal Vendetta man [ __ ] you
[07:17:49] it's Robin I hope alafa dies to the
[07:17:51] Charmy Festival on the horizon and the
[07:17:52] watchmaker's guest are barely holding
[07:17:54] their neither you nor I could face the
[07:17:56] severe consequences if dominicus arrival
[07:17:58] is delayed therefore I urge you to
[07:18:00] control your emotions and fulfill your
[07:18:02] responsibilities as for the matter of
[07:18:04] Robin there would be time to pursue it
[07:18:06] once the festival concludes his sister
[07:18:08] just died and he's addressing the matter
[07:18:10] of Robin at the end instead of at the
[07:18:11] start alphalpha is a little [ __ ] I hope
[07:18:14] he she or they [ __ ] dies master of
[07:18:17] pentacon nor this old OD is Happy recent
[07:18:22] performance they don't seem to care much
[07:18:24] about
[07:18:25] death instead they're more concerned
[07:18:27] about the Charmy Festival in the watch
[07:18:29] maker maybe the family heads don't think
[07:18:32] death is a big
[07:18:33] deal one thing's for sure there's a lot
[07:18:37] of internal conflict within the family
[07:18:39] and everybody has their own agenda why
[07:18:42] not I don't I don't mind Sunday but I
[07:18:44] feel like he's doing adventuring dirty
[07:18:46] and adventuring is the goat look at
[07:18:49] him he gambles gambling is good no it
[07:18:53] isn't oh wait list of isn't this what

[07:20:48] for dream construction mugs and drugs
[07:21:02] I'm not sure thinking things at first I
[07:21:04] thought there was like Slackers at work
[07:21:05] but now it doesn't seem like that this
[07:21:06] Traer really exists could they be
[07:21:09] responsible for Firefly and Robin's
[07:21:11] deaths perhaps that's why Sunday is
[07:21:13] taking this matter so
[07:21:15] seriously that's all for now nothing
[07:21:18] more note noteworthy before coming here
[07:21:22] I had all sorts of scenarios in my head
[07:21:25] about dealing with the family I did not
[07:21:28] expect an empty mansion
[07:21:31] watch out someone's approaching uh oh
[07:21:33] it's the meme
[07:21:34] again I don't think trespassing on
[07:21:37] forbidden areas is the way to be a guest
[07:21:39] Mr Yang
[07:21:42] and Aaron the galaxy ranger yo acaron
[07:21:46] could literally use her technique this
[07:21:48] guy's dead nobody came to greet us so we
[07:21:50] entered without permission I hope you
[07:21:53] can forgive us but even if there's no
[07:21:56] one to greet you you should wait for the
[07:21:58] host don't you agree shut the [ __ ] up
[07:22:00] son
[07:22:01] Saturday's better Friday's better as far
[07:22:04] as I know the crew has officially
[07:22:06] accepted the family's commission so
[07:22:09] coming here will be unnecessary for
[07:22:11] you on the contrary that's exactly why
[07:22:15] we're here to ask you about the case and
[07:22:17] gather more information we don't want
[07:22:21] any loose
[07:22:24] ends well since you've come with
[07:22:26] Goodwill I have no reason to show you
[07:22:28] the door thanks Sue rest assured he
[07:22:32] hasn't figured out that we went through
[07:22:33] those
[07:22:34] documents while the truth remains a
[07:22:38] mystery I'm getting close to it I assure
[07:22:41] you that the Traer will soon pay the
[07:22:44] price say it louder Aur she was lowy
[07:22:48] yapping in front of him I have a
[07:22:50] question for you if you don't mind how
[07:22:53] did the family come to the conclusion
[07:22:55] that the murderer was within the
[07:22:58] family with all due respect it's in the
[07:23:01] ipc's interest to wreak havoc before the
[07:23:03] charmony festival and the family has
[07:23:06] every reason to suspect the ipc's
[07:23:09] involvement well other family heads
[07:23:11] share the same suspicions as you but in
[07:23:15] my opinion the true murderer would never
[07:23:17] have drawn as much attention as that
[07:23:19] Ambassador did not to mention I
[07:23:22] personally Shackled him a while
[07:23:25] ago however I'll give you a suggestion
[07:23:28] regarding your suspicions Mr yang
[07:23:31] you should be more cautious of
[07:23:33] aventurine while the wicked can't break
[07:23:35] through high walls they can plunge their
[07:23:38] evil dagger into why would I be
[07:23:40] suspicious about aventurine although I
[07:23:41] feel like we've been at this quest for
[07:23:43] like 4 hours not to be a metag gamer of
[07:23:45] the quest but the version preview of
[07:23:47] this version uh had aventurine in like a
[07:23:49] boss form so I feel like that has to
[07:23:51] happen at some point but like I mean I
[07:23:53] couldn't skip that okay a businessman
[07:23:56] not some
[07:23:57] philanthropist but right now he's out
[07:23:59] there handing out his wealth on the
[07:24:01] streets and he went to the clock Studios
[07:24:04] theme park all by himself who knows what
[07:24:07] kind of scheme he's cooking
[07:24:09] up while the family is dedicated to
[07:24:11] keeping our guests safe it might be wise
[07:24:15] for you to stay
[07:24:16] alert you never know what unexpected
[07:24:20] troubles could arise I don't trust
[07:24:22] Sunday he is making the colon 3 phase
[07:24:25] though thank you for the raid
[07:24:28] gecko entered safe Zone according to a
[07:24:31] peerpoint hotline tip there was a major
[07:24:33] breakthrough in the shocking eazo
[07:24:36] aventurine case the suspect has been
[07:24:38] arrested wait EG is that his first name
[07:24:41] this fraud case has been linked to many
[07:24:43] departments within the inter Asal peace
[07:24:47] cor what the [ __ ] is Egg large drain in
[07:24:51] man and res resulting in the IPC taking
[07:24:55] a massive loss a planet oh what's his
[07:24:58] real name oh it's like a rook kada K
[07:25:01] Kasha kavada Kasha kavada yeah the one
[07:25:04] with the K kakav Vada K yeah KCK Basha
[07:25:10] kabas the case's main suspect originates
[07:25:13] from seonia 4 and is one of the
[07:25:15] survivors of the second kataka Ain
[07:25:18] Extinction event who does not carry an
[07:25:21] Interstellar Refugee travel permit oh
[07:25:24] it's not Auto playing I was like as per
[07:25:27] Strategic investment Department had
[07:25:29] Diamond sentiments the IPC has
[07:25:31] appropriately relocated the suspect in
[07:25:34] the spirit of the charter and will
[07:25:36] continue to condu name is di as to the
[07:25:39] motive of the
[07:25:43] suspect what pretty
[07:25:45] eyes tell
[07:25:47] me do they shine in the dark bro that
[07:25:52] what color are her eyes they did H sell
[07:25:54] them in a
[07:25:56] heartbeat you don't know how many people
[07:26:00] long for your eyes to be closed
[07:26:04] forever as a servant you should not
[07:26:07] resist your
[07:26:09] master yet you went and killed that man
[07:26:13] anyway Bas
[07:26:16] ofine no lawyer has the audacity to
[07:26:19] defend you I would perhaps you ought to
[07:26:23] represent you're going to jail but I can
[07:26:25] represent
[07:26:28] you not difficult
[07:26:31] but definitely
[07:26:33] pointless you're pretty confident on
[07:26:35] your
[07:26:36] eloquence did you also think that when
[07:26:38] you lied to the intelligence you
[07:26:41] [Music]
[07:26:43] guil ask and you shall receive you
[07:26:47] wanted the perfect construction material
[07:26:50] all I did was offer a possibility it was
[07:26:53] just a small wager if your luck holds
[07:26:56] out the IPC will dig something up from
[07:26:58] the Golden Sands of edih AO maybe even
[07:27:02] the sand King's
[07:27:04] remains pity your luck has run out I'll
[07:27:08] admit
[07:27:09] that what I'm more curious about though
[07:27:13] is why such a grand scheme failed to
[07:27:16] benefit anyone in the end including the
[07:27:19] perpetrator
[07:27:22] himself oh Madam I already have what I
[07:27:25] want to be brought before you for the
[07:27:28] next high Gamble
[07:27:32] then let's talk about the second
[07:27:34] gamble tell me what are you prepared to
[07:27:38] wager this time I'm prepared to wager
[07:27:39] everything Jade since the moment I laid
[07:27:42] eyes on you sorry my
[07:27:45] life I bet you won't send me to The
[07:27:52] Gallows what do you want
[07:27:56] then I want your Lenor to meet with me I
[07:28:00] have something to say and then what I
[07:28:04] want
[07:28:07] cash it can't be that simple can it it
[07:28:11] is that
[07:28:12] simple 30
[07:28:14] tonas the like that's not a
[07:28:17] lot market value I feel like her
[07:28:20] necklace like her her bracelet necklace
[07:28:22] that has to be like at least like a
[07:28:24] thousand tboss no
[07:28:28] less with this money all climbed to even
[07:28:31] greater Heights than you grasp even more
[07:28:34] riches than
[07:28:36] you I wager you won't give me this
[07:28:40] chance which is why you should call him
[07:28:46] here interesting a Pity Diamond won't
[07:28:50] see you no one gets to see him from here
[07:28:54] on out I am Diamond's representative and
[07:28:58] I will decide on his have okay you're
[07:29:02] wrong flirty tus he'll give you that and
[07:29:08] much more than that wealth
[07:29:12] status
[07:29:14] power the IPC will give you whatever you
[07:29:18] want even what you don't
[07:29:22] want
[07:29:25] kakava a good name but unfortunately
[07:29:29] destined to be buried in the dirt yo you
[07:29:33] though you deserve to live to create
[07:29:37] even more wealth oh that's how they
[07:29:40] chose his new name he's like yeah let's
[07:29:42] go on an adventure and then she's like
[07:29:45] adventurine go pick the clothes you like
[07:29:49] never mind then choose your desired
[07:29:51] identity and
[07:29:54] then use them well
[07:29:57] child may your plans never suffer
[07:30:02] failure life is like a long-term
[07:30:06] investment those who choose correctly do
[07:30:09] the correct things reach the correct
[07:30:12] outcomes show the world their
[07:30:15] value people can't always make the right
[07:30:18] choices in their
[07:30:20] lives but luck has always been on my
[07:30:23] side I've never lost is it because Gyra
[07:30:27] blesses me
[07:30:30] if that's the case she must also be
[07:30:31] looking upon me right
[07:30:35] now my success is
[07:30:38] inevitable
[07:30:40] but what
[07:30:42] then even if I overcome this difficult
[07:30:46] trial what would come
[07:30:49] next what awaits me after this glorious
[07:30:53] gamble an even more glorious one
[07:30:56] probably will I return triumphant with
[07:30:59] unending ing riches after countless
[07:31:01] successes
[07:31:04] or will I encounter
[07:31:08] failure never to
[07:31:13] return I'm pretty sure you already have
[07:31:16] some
[07:31:17] ideas lowly

[07:36:36] along the family truly showed leniency
[07:36:39] to everyone who came seeking help why
[07:36:42] would there be a need for such high
[07:36:44] walls and deep Mo that's a good point
[07:36:47] future me however people don't see it
[07:36:50] like that especially since the flavor of
[07:36:53] the dream syrup is so
[07:36:55] alluring you will receive no charity on
[07:36:58] panon
[07:37:00] and relying on your own strength alone
[07:37:02] to top all high
[07:37:05] walls not of likely
[07:37:08] fet which is why once you step into the
[07:37:12] hotel you remove your high hat and beg
[07:37:16] everyone you come across for
[07:37:19] help like a hyena Scavenging for scraps
[07:37:23] in the
[07:37:24] desert because you know that
[07:37:27] opportunities are fleeting
[07:37:30] okay well when you put it like that even
[07:37:33] ratios of teeny peacock analogy sounds
[07:37:36] pleasant ratio is what well you know how
[07:37:39] rare it is for me to give you the
[07:37:40] Straight Dope so listen while you
[07:37:43] can it's good timing that you mentioned
[07:37:46] the doctor I'm especially fond of what
[07:37:49] you and he have in common the
[07:37:52] conspiracies
[07:37:55] calculations especially the part about
[07:37:58] the finale a magnific Act of betrayal oh
[07:38:02] when everyone thinks this way who would
[07:38:05] even suspect that it was another trap
[07:38:07] you've meticulously
[07:38:11] devised go on tell me I'm right you know
[07:38:15] who you really are Mr Cavalier Gambler
[07:38:18] up tight over
[07:38:20] cautious massive inferiority
[07:38:24] complex you've won so much you're still
[07:38:27] so afraid of Los
[07:38:31] they only see your big bets your bravado
[07:38:33] the Full House the straet full they
[07:38:37] don't know the other hand is below the
[07:38:40] table clutching your
[07:38:44] chips for dear life yeah cuz he's a
[07:38:48] gabbler it's a heck of an act no wonder
[07:38:52] the tavern sent you an invite you're a
[07:38:55] natural kid you don't stop at fooling
[07:38:57] the audience you fool yourself
[07:39:01] too well the best way to prevent others
[07:39:04] from seeing your true colors is first
[07:39:06] being able to fool
[07:39:11] yourself of course I know you won't to
[07:39:15] well but it's
[07:39:18] strange why did you decline that
[07:39:21] invitation you had the chance to embrace
[07:39:23] alation was that not what you most
[07:39:25] wanted but you chose the IPC instead
[07:39:30] for the
[07:39:32] preservation I doubt it do you even have
[07:39:35] anything in common with the
[07:39:39] preservation Oh I thought you knew
[07:39:42] didn't you say you had me
[07:39:44] pegged you had me
[07:39:47] what wait but but like what if he chose
[07:39:50] preservation cuz he was like okay well
[07:39:53] so far Stell hasn't really released any
[07:39:55] like good preservation characters like
[07:39:56] this jard but he's like a like a
[07:39:58] standard Banner character and like fire
[07:40:00] MC but like that's like a [ __ ] fire
[07:40:02] MC so I feel like we need a new like
[07:40:04] five star preservation so I'll do I'll
[07:40:06] take one for the team maybe that's why

[07:42:03] cackles you had to hide right under the
[07:42:06] noses of those

[07:42:13] dead drifting and all that Bloody
[07:42:18] water completely ruin that
[07:42:20] shirt shame wasn't that the last one dad
[07:42:24] left
[07:42:26] behind it wasn't ruined
[07:42:30] I've always kept it come on it's a rag
[07:42:35] it's not like you can ever wear
[07:42:38] it now you don't have to hide you
[07:42:41] probably won't even Dain to get your
[07:42:43] pretty outfit wet in the
[07:42:45] rain your Social Capital has changed
[07:42:48] after all I've never changed on the
[07:42:52] contrary now you're the one who does the
[07:42:55] hunting the last round of hide and seek
[07:42:58] and you get to be
[07:43:00] it you should enjy
[07:43:05] it that child still don't really know
[07:43:08] what the [ __ ] going on but could he be
[07:43:09] in
[07:43:15] here is
[07:43:18] this oh the
[07:43:20] job a
[07:43:23] topaz what is this doing here
[07:43:31] what does her Cornerstone wrench out
[07:43:33] your heart
[07:43:35] so that is merely curious why it was
[07:43:38] here wait let me Google something
[07:43:40] aventurine is a type of
[07:43:43] quartz I see this just like IPC lore cuz
[07:43:46] there we have topaz we have Jade we have
[07:43:48] aventurine why is it his name
[07:43:51] quartz maybe that winged guy put it here
[07:43:56] to you you just realized okay I mean I
[07:44:00] knew the other two but I didn't know
[07:44:01] [ __ ] aventurine was
[07:44:02] a stone
[07:44:07] diamond okay the cornerstone's Hue is
[07:44:11] the same as the radiance of cp's
[07:44:15] body I've got to give it to you I've
[07:44:17] heard a lot of baloney but that lie
[07:44:19] deserves a prize for sheer nerve if he
[07:44:23] were just a little bit smarter The Jig
[07:44:27] would have been up right there
[07:44:32] this is just bait true of course that's
[07:44:36] why Rio's betrayal was one of the keys
[07:44:38] to your plan I have to say that doctor's
[07:44:41] acting wasb true or maybe he wasn't
[07:44:45] acting at all uh all the better for you
[07:44:49] Sunday didn't become head of the oak
[07:44:50] family by acting
[07:44:52] sloppy he's obsessed with
[07:44:55] control you have to give him enough
[07:44:57] detail to satisfy his meticulous nature
[07:44:59] but not so much that he gets
[07:45:03] suspicious meanwhile alam's plan was
[07:45:06] I'll just get
[07:45:07] caught sorry which is why you had ratio
[07:45:09] seek him out and leak the plan on
[07:45:11] purpose to prevent the other party from
[07:45:14] suspecting
[07:45:15] any then until you gave tertio was all
[07:45:18] true we spoke the same to
[07:45:22] Sunday finally Sunday took the bait
[07:45:26] found me the Cornerstone and before you
[07:45:28] know it
[07:45:34] everyone's distracted enough for you to
[07:45:36] steal the third Stone right out from
[07:45:39] under them
[07:45:43] huh why don't you stop rumaging through
[07:45:45] my
[07:45:47] mind your
[07:45:50] mind it's our mind you're me and I'm
[07:45:57] you the best way way to prevent others
[07:46:00] from seeing your true colors is to First
[07:46:02] be able to fool
[07:46:04] yourself really you can't even fool
[07:46:08] yourself you just got lucky this
[07:46:12] time bless you the other Corner Sunday's
[07:46:16] hands rather beautiful
[07:46:18] green just like you
[07:46:22] smooth
[07:46:23] cunning tell
[07:46:25] me what's it name
[07:46:29] why are you even asking me must I do all
[07:46:34] the
[07:46:34] work Avenger is the stone of luck and
[07:46:38] trickery that's what she said when you
[07:46:40] received the stone wasn't
[07:46:42] it this type of stone isn't rare but its
[07:46:46] Hue is very similar to a certain gem in
[07:46:50] fact it's often used as a
[07:46:52] substitute and that more precious gem is
[07:47:01] Jade even Sunday can't tell the
[07:47:03] difference I see oh looks like Jade can
[07:47:06] be substituted for aventurine
[07:47:09] too sauce for the
[07:47:14] goose aventurin topaz
[07:47:17] Jade three Elites three cornerstones who
[07:47:22] Okay
[07:47:23] sense offered their
[07:47:27] everything you're even more united than
[07:47:30] the
[07:47:32] family as I've said before three chips
[07:47:35] are sufficient All or
[07:47:38] Nothing but will it be the former or the
[07:47:44] latter we'll find out soon
[07:47:47] enough so where's the real aventurine
[07:47:50] Stone take it out let's have a
[07:47:55] look suddenly you don't know where it is
[07:47:59] I just want to hear you say it after all
[07:48:02] it really does resemble its
[07:48:08] owner As You Wish then they never went
[07:48:12] anywhere they're right where they belong
[07:48:15] do you think he hit it like where the
[07:48:16] [ __ ] the chess player hid the the
[07:48:19] like these cheap
[07:48:22] bubles you smashed the aventurine stone
[07:48:26] before you left
[07:48:28] oh just look at
[07:48:32] it
[07:48:33] shattered just like your life poor thing
[07:48:38] a humble Pebble coated in the most
[07:48:40] lustrous
[07:48:42] Sheen I take it back this thing is far
[07:48:46] more precious than your
[07:48:48] life you're absolutely clear about the
[07:48:51] consequences of doing this blasphemy
[07:48:54] against clio's body you think the IPC
[07:48:57] will let you get off scott
[07:49:00] free well Diamond has always been all
[07:49:03] about results as long as I can create
[07:49:06] value far beyond the cost the ends
[07:49:08] justify the
[07:49:12] needs how else would the family be
[07:49:14] fooled if there was no price to pay it
[07:49:17] doesn't matter even smash to Smithers
[07:49:21] the preservation Cornerstone can still
[07:49:23] be used its effect may be greatly
[07:49:25] diminished but it's enough for me
[07:49:30] now I'm really
[07:49:32] curious why does every step you take
[07:49:34] involve Reckless risks and the choices
[07:49:37] you prepare for yourself always come
[07:49:38] with a strong impulse for
[07:49:40] self-destruction bro aren't you me you
[07:49:42] should know this do you truly believe
[07:49:44] that the greater the risk the greater
[07:49:46] the
[07:49:47] rewards I wouldn't have guessed you'd be
[07:49:49] so loyal to the
[07:49:50] IPC there is so much you don't
[07:49:54] see which is also why you'll never see
[07:49:56] how I'll win it all
[07:50:00] that is if you can do what it
[07:50:07] takes okay I'll just have to wait and
[07:50:09] see
[07:50:10] then the Cornerstone is gone another
[07:50:14] illusion of the
[07:50:21] harmony hello we meet again Mr pretty

[07:54:46] you that man gave you your first job and
[07:54:50] you made your first PT of
[07:54:52] gold I remember it all too well you
[07:54:56] wrapped that iron chain around your
[07:54:59] for that is the only tool you could find
[07:55:02] then in that
[07:55:04] maze shut

[07:55:10] past unwilling to admit that your life
[07:55:13] is worth only 60
[07:55:15] Tas well from what I see you refuse to
[07:55:19] confront it because it only proves your
[07:55:23] weakness How could a weak person take
[07:55:25] such daring risk true
[07:55:28] how could I be weak if I can gamble big
[07:55:32] aventurine right you love the thrill of
[07:55:36] danger but he refused to let go of
[07:55:39] meaningless
[07:55:40] sentiments even in this beautiful dream
[07:55:43] the only thing you dare allow
[07:55:46] yourself is death in your hands those
[07:55:50] who follow you could have become Joker
[07:55:52] cards they're far more useful that way
[07:55:55] it's not like this is the only place the
[07:55:57] family ever cut corners
[07:55:59] you could have had tons of action if you
[07:56:01] weren't so all or
[07:56:02] nothing all it takes is a Meer
[07:56:06] sacrifice I bet opal would have resolved
[07:56:09] this without a fuss pity you're not him
[07:56:13] op wouldn't be in this state if you
[07:56:14] could just get with the
[07:56:16] program and why couldn't you out of
[07:56:20] professional Integrity those techniques
[07:56:23] you mentioned are highly efficient but
[07:56:24] it's not that I don't know about them
[07:56:27] it's more like I couldn't care
[07:56:29] less get it what fun is it if the fight
[07:56:32] isn't fair fair you assume your
[07:56:36] opponents would fight fair in the first
[07:56:39] place the odds are obviously not in your
[07:56:42] favor so how are you just breezing by
[07:56:46] but did that mask Fool's words awaken
[07:56:48] something in
[07:56:50] Youk theom that could turn everything
[07:56:53] upside
[07:56:56] down everything you mean it could make
[07:56:59] all the cards on the table
[07:57:02] just
[07:57:04] disappear W that's
[07:57:07] cheating magic trick if these leaves

[07:57:38] consider selling it you obviously could
[07:57:41] have lived a normal life like big sis
[07:57:43] that way looking back that was the
[07:57:46] better choice Mama only left us with two
[07:57:49] pieces of jewelry a necklace and a lucky
[07:57:53] charm there won't ever be a third
[07:57:56] piece that's what you always say but you

[07:58:14] by GATRA triclops and can lead the clan
[07:58:18] to happiness so always remember to

[08:09:58] having never lost before but why
[08:10:03] you
[08:10:05] why must it be you if all your luck is
[08:10:09] built on the pain of someone you
[08:10:12] love on the loss of dozens
[08:10:15] more if these windfalls these jackpots
[08:10:20] aren't a gift from

[08:18:40] control the insurgents are from a local
[08:18:43] Clan known as kataka which has a long
[08:18:46] history of disdain towards the
[08:18:49] IPC this has caused a serious negative
[08:18:52] impact to the work of the ipc's
[08:18:54] marketing Development Department
[08:18:57] the clan launched a massive attack on
[08:18:59] the ajun who were under the protection
[08:19:02] of the IPC resulting in
[08:19:06] 6,728 deaths and 3,000 what the [ __ ]

[08:20:48] memory for
[08:20:54] you uhoh
[08:21:02] kakava by the way before you go I have a
[08:21:06] personal question
[08:21:08] you do you truly want to destroy the
[08:21:11] world with your own hands
[08:21:14] y let's
[08:21:16] assume just assuming now that every time
[08:21:20] I roll the dice there's a possibility
[08:21:23] let's assume for the sake of
[08:21:25] argument
[08:21:27] sorry then I would be quite happy to
[08:21:30] make that
[08:21:34] wager let's say that hypothetically
[08:21:37] every time we touched I got that
[08:21:39] feeling hello I'm himo the astral
[08:21:42] Express's
[08:21:44] Navigator hello I'm March 7th I'm sure
[08:21:48] she needs no introduction as you
[08:21:50] definitely know her you can call me
[08:21:53] Clocky uh hello
[08:21:57] none of you seem surprised by my arrival
[08:22:00] since welt has decided to travel with
[08:22:02] you it means that he trusts you and we
[08:22:05] trust his
[08:22:07] judgment I master y dude it's 8:00 a.m.
[08:22:11] comeing a break I eny your close friend
[08:22:13] Miss acaron here doesn't present a
[08:22:15] danger and she's of no threat to the
[08:22:17] astral Express aventurin prior
[08:22:20] accusation was based on nothing more
[08:22:22] than his own subjectivity which is why
[08:22:26] before we continue working together he
[08:22:29] has a duty to explain himself you want
[08:22:32] to create a situation where all three
[08:22:36] parties are
[08:22:38] present there must be some deeper
[08:22:41] meaning behind aventurine
[08:22:44] actions I suspect he's been aware of
[08:22:47] penton's secret from the beginning and
[08:22:50] has been continuously strategizing to
[08:22:54] unveil in that sense the Asal Express's
[08:22:58] role in his plans would be
[08:23:00] imperative in the worst case scenario I
[08:23:03] feel like well he's like smart and he
[08:23:05] like knows what's going on but it takes
[08:23:06] him to like the end of the quest to
[08:23:08] figure it out it's like the nuk's about
[08:23:09] to detonate and he's like ah there's a
[08:23:13] nuke assuming things do escalate to that
[08:23:16] stage having an extra Ally is a good
[08:23:19] insurance policy penone has numerous
[08:23:23] factions and the State of Affairs is TW
[08:23:26] It's
[08:23:29] fucking. s just tweeted like 8 what the
[08:23:31] [ __ ] is happening it's 8 in the morning

[08:23:38] spoilers okay never mind this just Robin
[08:23:42] stuff ow [ __ ] sorry Robin this is so
[08:23:45] loud assuming things do escalate to the
[08:23:50] stage I for allies to get CH policy ped
[08:23:53] has new as factions and the State of
[08:23:55] Affairs is significantly more intricate
[08:23:56] than that of the bog and the sanjo but
[08:23:59] we must meet me me is that a word what
[08:24:03] the [ __ ] is meat but like with a t i Am
[08:24:05] the bone of my bat stellon is my body
[08:24:07] and trailblaze is my blood you're
[08:24:09] talking weird again but it's a good vibe
[08:24:14] to it's a good vibe yo March who taught
[08:24:17] you that
[08:24:18] word the path ahead is fraught with
[08:24:22] danger but what's trailblazing without a
[08:24:25] little danger
[08:24:27] fate reference I have not watched fate I
[08:24:29] watched one episode I okay I swear to my
[08:24:32] life this is true one of the only fate
[08:24:34] things I've seen is I went upstairs one
[08:24:35] day and a sto was on my dad's TV but I
[08:24:38] haven't actually watched fate sounds
[08:24:40] like we've reached a
[08:24:42] consensus he was watching fate Miss
[08:24:44] Aaron so I know I know I stole foe I
[08:24:47] will accompany you of course oh bet
[08:24:50] let's move out then no need to rush if
[08:24:53] he truly has laid a trap he will
[08:24:55] definitely dude this Quest started with
[08:24:57] Sam where the [ __ ] did Sam go so we
[08:24:59] still have to see Sam and we still have
[08:25:01] to see aventurine boss which means I
[08:25:03] probably have another eight hours left
[08:25:04] it's [ __ ] and
[08:25:07] gentlemen the most
[08:25:10] wnic show in penton's history is about
[08:25:13] to begin the IPC cord

[08:25:42] to come to the conclusion and 20 seconds
[08:25:44] later aventurine speaks and all caps on
[08:25:46] the mic so it doesn't even matter if he
[08:25:48] figured it out or not cuz we're about to

[08:28:01] something that can be summed up in a few
[08:28:09] words but I chose to believe you and my
[08:28:13] trust in you stems more from my own
[08:28:17] personal
[08:28:19] judgment I also believe that if it were

[08:43:07] you mentioned
[08:43:09] pentacon what do you hope to find within
[08:43:12] a dream I'm not looking for anything
[08:43:15] they aren't in a
[08:43:17] dream I'm afraid the family will not
[08:43:21] open the doors for you why because the
[08:43:25] you
[08:43:26] walk is not accept man [ __ ] the harmony
[08:43:30] even
[08:43:31] if that's not what I want precisely
[08:43:35] because it's not what you
[08:43:37] want because they are not like other
[08:43:40] eons they have never glanced at
[08:43:43] anyone and they never need to they leave
[08:43:46] woven strands of Fate for humans to walk
[08:43:50] and
[08:43:51] together they we a great shadow
[08:43:56] and this
[08:43:58] Shadow silently envelops
[08:44:05] them okay on second thought I think I
[08:44:08] think I forgive the harmony I just
[08:44:09] looked up Zee
[08:44:13] zeip there are always those who rise
[08:44:15] from the
[08:44:20] Shadows they mostly become a part of The

[08:44:26] eyes am I the
[08:44:28] same you still have a strand of color

[08:48:39] it's is [ __ ] sick KY this is not the
[08:48:41] place you were
[08:48:47] expecting
[08:48:50] uhoh oh [ __ ]
[08:48:53] Melody is it
[08:48:57] perhaps to you I am just an emanator
[08:49:00] who's hiding her identity
[08:49:05] but the sleeping and shapeless never
[08:49:08] glance at
[08:49:09] anyone they have no face no form and
[08:49:13] even less of a will to
[08:49:15] speak the nihility envelops everyone
[08:49:20] equally only some who have gone under
[08:49:22] their Shadow can go farther
[08:49:25] tainting themselves with more
[08:49:28] nihility that's
[08:49:31] all that's
[08:49:34] all my friend you really leave me at a
[08:49:37] loss for
[08:49:38] words
[08:49:41] so is this my final
[08:49:45] destination the Land of the Dead this is
[08:49:49] all but a fleeting dream one of the
[08:49:51] thousands of manifestations of ax
[08:49:55] under the watchful eye of nihility we
[08:49:58] momentarily linger here before moving on
[08:50:01] to our own
[08:50:03] paths it seems that my death has already
[08:50:05] been determined oh [ __ ] even if you wish
[08:50:09] for it oh POG I can't promise you
[08:50:12] anything now that you've accomplished
[08:50:15] your goal I think you can be a little
[08:50:17] more
[08:50:20] forthcoming what do you
[08:50:22] mean your performance at the theme part
[08:50:24] was wonderful and
[08:50:26] grandiose a simple yet practical
[08:50:29] technique that fooled almost
[08:50:33] everyone no one would have ever thought
[08:50:35] that you would have gone to such lengths
[08:50:38] even staking your life just to prove a
[08:50:41] fact that had seemingly been disproved
[08:50:43] long ago real death does not exist in
[08:50:46] penton's
[08:50:50] Dreamscape
[08:50:53] true why would I so Firefly is still
[08:50:55] chilling There's Hope because this is
[08:50:58] the only way you can uncover a secret
[08:51:00] that is even more unspeakable than the
[08:51:02] serial murders to use this dream death
[08:51:06] to get there to that Promised Land
[08:51:09] people constantly seek in this Grand
[08:51:12] Gathering
[08:51:14] penacon the legacy of the watch
[08:51:18] maker the true land of Exile I mean
[08:51:21] Exile is not bad it gives energy to your
[08:51:22] whole team but for a fourstar set I'd
[08:51:24] rather use instructor usually or like no
[08:51:26] blast or something but it's fine how did
[08:51:28] you find out I never imagined that
[08:51:31] something I learned about unexpectedly
[08:51:34] would become the key to connecting
[08:51:37] everything it's that person's identity
[08:51:40] isn't
[08:51:41] it watch [ __ ] no it can't be actually
[08:51:45] never mind I see you're in the
[08:51:48] no they're probably yapping about
[08:51:50] [ __ ] let's just say I had put money
[08:51:52] on the
[08:51:53] possibility the murder murder isn't
[08:51:55] nearly enough to disrupt business as
[08:51:57] usual even if there were one or two
[08:51:59] murders on
[08:52:00] pentacon most people wouldn't be
[08:52:03] personally
[08:52:04] affected and that won't create anyways
[08:52:06] who okay they're probably talking about
[08:52:08] the head of the family that's the
[08:52:09] traitor I thought they were talking
[08:52:10] about Sam but I don't think they're
[08:52:11] talking about Zam probably the [ __ ]
[08:52:12] family person Ian there's no way they're
[08:52:14] talking about Misha yet cuz the [ __ ]
[08:52:15] Mel like cone was the patch after so I
[08:52:18] don't think there's lore about him yet
[08:52:19] but maybe this dream of theirs isn't a
[08:52:21] boundless
[08:52:22] sea it's a lonely
[08:52:25] Island the family used the harmony to
[08:52:27] build a high wall and isolate them from
[08:52:29] the vast and treacherous ocean of the
[08:52:31] outside
[08:52:35] world that barrier they build keeps
[08:52:37] death out but it also keeps the secrets
[08:52:41] that are lost in that watery Abyss from
[08:52:43] floating to the
[08:52:45] surface in a beautiful dream free of
[08:52:49] suffering who would want to go fishing
[08:52:51] for those
[08:52:53] Secrets no no one unless haha unless
[08:52:58] unless someone goes to the other side of
[08:53:00] the barrier and lives to tell the
[08:53:03] tale someone already
[08:53:07] has I got the idea early on chewing on
[08:53:10] that masked Fool's little
[08:53:12] hint if a mute isn't someone who cannot
[08:53:15] make a sound then it has to be someone
[08:53:18] who cannot
[08:53:20] speak oh someone who survived the Tre
[08:53:24] prous STS but is unable to take the
[08:53:27] stage and speak the
[08:53:30] truth I'm happy to know she's safe in
[08:53:32] sound and still on
[08:53:35] Penton oh
[08:53:37] hint is that not
[08:53:40] proof well proof is the one thing I
[08:53:42] don't have the only thing that can prove
[08:53:46] these
[08:53:48] conjectures is for the family to come
[08:53:50] clean and with the way they buttered up
[08:53:53] these know who the second one is though
[08:53:55] it seems pretty clear they're intent on
[08:53:58] covering their TR like it's Robin plus
[08:54:00] one but you don't need proof to have a
[08:54:03] suspicion and for me suspicion is enough
[08:54:07] S I didn't need to find the memory Zone
[08:54:09] meme I just needed for someone to kill
[08:54:12] me like it killed that silver-haired
[08:54:15] girl you don't sound very confident to
[08:54:18] me going out of your way to make
[08:54:20] Citywide broadcasts in an attempt to
[08:54:22] involve more people
[08:54:25] you are simply betting on the
[08:54:26] possibility of someone being able to
[08:54:28] break down the
[08:54:29] barrier you're very lucky that fate has
[08:54:32] decided to let us cross
[08:54:35] paths I happen to be equipped with a
[08:54:37] very sharp blade sharp enough to slice
[08:54:41] through the veil of
[08:54:43] dreams I can also carve the Harmony's
[08:54:45] brand off of
[08:54:47] you well I still don't get how the
[08:54:49] [ __ ] Veil thing works though the um I
[08:54:52] mean whatever you possess great
[08:54:55] cunning deliberately setting us up to be
[08:54:58] on opposing sides constantly repeating
[08:55:00] the words of the emanator in front of
[08:55:02] others leaving me no choice like they
[08:55:05] like we put up a wall to separate us
[08:55:06] from the other people or whatever the
[08:55:08] [ __ ] which like I get but like how do
[08:55:09] you break that wall like how do you what
[08:55:11] the [ __ ] my blade is sharp enough to
[08:55:13] slice through it what does that even
[08:55:16] mean and that's how you
[08:55:19] win opportunity and strategy both are
[08:55:23] essential
[08:55:25] she's just that girl okay all right
[08:55:29] that's how you win strategy both are
[08:55:30] essential and in your plans the IPC
[08:55:33] always wins it's a metaphor maybe you
[08:55:35] just have to
[08:55:37] die to the family the life of an
[08:55:40] ambassador is still
[08:55:43] invaluable that's a huge gamble isn't it
[08:55:47] but allow me to point out a mistake the
[08:55:50] ipc's Success is Not Guaranteed I
[08:55:54] unfortunately have no contingencies for
[08:55:57] such an important
[08:56:01] matter detonating a
[08:56:03] stellon I can't do it the aventurine
[08:56:06] stone is too broken to even Safeguard my
[08:56:08] escape from the stage if at the end of
[08:56:11] the day you did not unsheath your
[08:56:13] blade I would have lost the bet but you
[08:56:16] w the bet so moral of the story keep
[08:56:18] gambling it is pointless to discuss it
[08:56:21] works you have won your prize is an
[08:56:24] entry ticket into that deep sea and
[08:56:27] after this whether you can return from
[08:56:29] the
[08:56:30] abyss is another gamble of yours have
[08:56:34] you never
[08:56:35] wavered
[08:56:38] wavered of course I
[08:56:40] have but I can only Bank on my own good
[08:56:43] fortune because other than
[08:56:47] that I have
[08:56:52] nothing wake up from this and go to
[08:56:55] where you should be your gamble is not
[08:56:59] over
[08:57:03] yet
[08:57:07] now yo yo chill before we
[08:57:12] part can you answer one more
[08:57:16] question as someone who has traveled on
[08:57:19] that
[08:57:20] road can tell me
[08:57:24] why are we born into this
[08:57:27] world if it's just to
[08:57:33] die she's I don't think this I never
[08:57:37] have nor do
[08:57:39] you but the nihility envelops you and
[08:57:44] I and
[08:57:46] everyone and because of that it's
[08:57:49] pointless
[08:57:51] what nihilism Frederick nech but it is
[08:57:57] still there if the dice of Fate are
[08:58:00] always waited then that is our
[08:58:04] destiny why
[08:58:07] then do we struggle against it my answer
[08:58:11] might not be able to resolve your
[08:58:13] confusion because it has been with you
[08:58:15] throughout your journey and is already a
[08:58:17] part of your
[08:58:20] life but you said sleep is the rehearsal
[08:58:24] of death so why does life
[08:58:27] Slumber because we are not ready for the
[08:58:30] final
[08:58:31] rest okay Akon's really good at saying a
[08:58:33] lot of words without saying any words so
[08:58:36] you can definitely understand why we
[08:58:38] want to be
[08:58:40] prepared even if the ending has been
[08:58:42] predetermined that's fine there are
[08:58:44] countless things that humans cannot
[08:58:46] change like
[08:58:49] you but before the end there are many
[08:58:53] things that humans can do while on their
[08:58:56] journey and because of this whoa whoa
[08:58:58] whoa whoa the end will thus reveal a
[08:59:01] completely different meaning yo acon
[08:59:03] your text to change
[08:59:06] colors take a good look at your pocket
[08:59:10] your friend has already given you the
[08:59:15] answer good
[08:59:22] luck oh my God it's the the butt plug Dr
[08:59:25] ratio gave us yo no way what the [ __ ]
[08:59:28] the impossible in the dreams game is not
[08:59:31] death but rather dorcy stay alive I wish
[08:59:34] you the best of luck love
[08:59:39] ratio I forgot about that he gave that
[08:59:42] to us like last stream and I shall get

[09:03:05] quiet death but this man is different he
[09:03:07] lives and breathes in the present in

[09:05:53] in
[09:05:54] failure before I knew it this world and
[09:05:58] I became too
[09:06:01] intertwined and it became too difficult

[09:15:23] hand there's even a bit about the Galaxy
[09:15:26] Rangers being turned into Gibbons by Dr
[09:15:29] primitive and they're in some Valley
[09:15:31] screwing around on
[09:15:34] swings of course I know you won't
[09:15:37] believe me which is also why similarly I
[09:15:41] have a hard time believing that you're
[09:15:43] the real
[09:15:44] nameless see the bullets in this gun 9
[09:15:48] mm an eternal classic I may need the as
[09:15:53] expresses help right now but if you're
[09:15:55] an impostor just like that
[09:15:58] one this okay I think I like okay I
[09:16:01] think I like his design like visuals I
[09:16:03] think it's just every time I hear him
[09:16:05] talk I'm just imagining a k and a
[09:16:08] WOTE I can't allow myself to be exposed
[09:16:11] to Danger that's just the way it goes so
[09:16:16] you all have to first prove
[09:16:19] yourselves huh where are you going
[09:16:28] recognize
[09:16:31] this recognize this whips out his [ __ ]
[09:16:34] model fuder the Jade Abacus of Ally and
[09:16:38] oath the C Joe really gave this to you
[09:16:42] guys mod fudger yo don't teach pom pom
[09:16:45] to swear this is the Jade abicus gifted
[09:16:47] to the express by the sheno lau's
[09:16:50] general Jing Yuen
[09:16:53] its presence on board serves as the
[09:16:54] sheno alliance's official recognition of
[09:16:57] the
[09:16:59] express is that
[09:17:02] enough not bad
[09:17:05] kiddo and across these spring Stars a
[09:17:09] gentle squeeze is all it takes to rustle
[09:17:12] up a whole Legion of cloud
[09:17:15] nights now I reckon that'd be one
[09:17:19] fudging sight to
[09:17:21] behold hm
[09:17:24] now it's your turn you're so fuckus
[09:17:26] unskipable quene into unable scene wait
[09:17:29] what wait am I done with 4.1 what is
[09:17:32] happening I just want to I want to
[09:17:33] process what happened did Gallagher just
[09:17:35] kill him what what is
[09:17:37] happening give me some time to Pro I
[09:17:39] mean 21 give me some time to process all
[09:17:42] right then what is happenings any
[09:17:44] questions my way let's see if my answers
[09:17:47] can't turn your trust if your gut tells
[09:17:50] you otherwise still ain't too late to
[09:17:53] show me the door and why would I play
[09:17:56] along if I truly am a real galaxy ranger
[09:18:01] you stand to lose
[09:18:03] nothing all right then tell me what kind
[09:18:08] of organization are the Galaxy
[09:18:13] Rangers oh my friend this question is a
[09:18:17] hard one don't think I can even consider
[09:18:20] us and I like that his eyes are
[09:18:23] targets that's pretty cool everyone's on
[09:18:26] their own faded path along the hunt with
[09:18:29] their own Resolute sense of rightousness
[09:18:31] and not so welcome among such so-called
[09:18:34] Universal
[09:18:37] values
[09:18:40] oh this reply does not instill trust it
[09:18:44] only makes your predicament
[09:18:46] more
[09:18:49] precarious I'm guessing you're going to
[09:18:51] ask about some form of shared Faith
[09:18:54] right but us Galaxy Rangers don't need
[09:18:57] that sort of thing cuz CH okay okay I'm
[09:18:59] going to come clean I don't look at
[09:19:01] leaks I try not to look at leaks but
[09:19:03] like four or five months ago I saw like
[09:19:05] some character with black and white hair
[09:19:07] that like a star rail design and it was
[09:19:09] like this guy before he was like a
[09:19:10] cowboy I was like holy [ __ ] this looks
[09:19:12] like the coolest character I've ever
[09:19:13] seen in my life it wasn't even I didn't
[09:19:14] look for it someone showed it to me and
[09:19:16] then now he has a cowboy hat and [ __ ]
[09:19:17] and like he's still cool I just wasn't
[09:19:19] expecting a cowboy anyway I like him
[09:19:23] never bully the weak he was always a
[09:19:26] cowboy kill the
[09:19:27] innocent these Oaths aren't something
[09:19:30] lofty believes but the fundamental
[09:19:33] bottom line that one must never cross
[09:19:35] maybe he was I don't [ __ ] know
[09:19:37] whatever maybe it no hat or something I
[09:19:39] don't I don't know I don't remember what
[09:19:40] I saw he did have the Hat okay I don't
[09:19:43] even know anymore as Galaxy Rangers we
[09:19:47] the bestly adhere to the bottom line
[09:19:50] when someone crosses them the Hunt's
[09:19:53] Vengeance will surely come
[09:19:55] knocking and In This Moment the other
[09:19:58] crucial meaning of bottom line comes
[09:20:00] into play as long as you don't cross it
[09:20:03] you're free to do whatever you please
[09:20:06] you catch my
[09:20:08] drift second
[09:20:10] question why do you seek trouble with
[09:20:13] the astral
[09:20:15] Express I already said that I seek no
[09:20:18] trouble I must go to pinone for a matter
[09:20:22] but I don't have an invite and I can't
[09:20:25] even enter the family's Hotel
[09:20:27] doors if only I could borrow the
[09:20:32] nameless his
[09:20:33] identity the entire Cosmos knows your
[09:20:36] guest of the
[09:20:38] family aren't the Galaxy Rangers also
[09:20:41] esteemed
[09:20:43] guests well youve hit the nail on the
[09:20:46] head this is why I'm here how long is
[09:20:50] this cut scene if I tell you the Rangers
[09:20:53] are pursuing an impostor a son of a nice
[09:20:55] lady son of a nice lady posing as one of
[09:20:58] us she's on pentagone in right
[09:21:01] now my informant is a memo keeper she's
[09:21:05] the same as all my medic organisms
[09:21:08] appearing one moment and gone the next
[09:21:11] she scares the fudge out of me still she
[09:21:15] gave me some vital
[09:21:17] info that galaxy ranger impostor who is
[09:21:21] it impostor is that the third question
[09:21:24] is it a hard question it isn't just that
[09:21:27] you might not believe me that person
[09:21:30] calls herself acaron in according to our
[09:21:34] informant she could be an emanator of
[09:21:40] nil that's
[09:21:42] impossible that's what I said don't
[09:21:45] worry we're I first received the news I
[09:21:48] had the exact same reaction as you I ex
[09:21:52] never gives anyone so much wait are you
[09:21:54] forced into this cut scene if you enter
[09:21:56] the [ __ ] reason would they train
[09:21:59] station morals cuz I think zff was
[09:22:01] telling me in a call he was like dude
[09:22:03] you have to go through 20 minutes of
[09:22:04] [ __ ] just to enter memory of chaos I'm
[09:22:06] like
[09:22:08] oh then you must know that emat can also
[09:22:12] conceal their own identities which for
[09:22:14] many people it's better that way
[09:22:17] otherwise there'd be wanting Bloodshed
[09:22:19] across the cosmos or even perhaps
[09:22:23] turning their back on the path they're
[09:22:25] supposed to
[09:22:26] follow I had the Good Fortune of running
[09:22:29] into an Elation emanator its appearance
[09:22:33] was no different than that of those
[09:22:35] clowns if it weren't through sheer luck
[09:22:38] that I got it drunk I would have never
[09:22:40] known of its eminent
[09:22:42] status even in the purest hunt you'll
[09:22:46] find the yenjo alliance under the
[09:22:48] spotlight and Galaxy Rangers lurking in
[09:22:51] the shadows
[09:22:52] paths are inevitably Concepts created by
[09:22:55] people and exist in Plains beyond our
[09:23:00] understanding to reckon that nihility
[09:23:02] emanator don't exist well maybe we just
[09:23:08] ain't nihilistic
[09:23:12] enough so do you understand now your
[09:23:17] companion does this [ __ ] also
[09:23:19] only have one earring they do this on
[09:23:21] every character you don't want to
[09:23:22] believe me you'd best send a message to
[09:23:25] him I'd advise you to move
[09:23:27] fast we don't know what's happening in
[09:23:30] the dream stape or how much of what the
[09:23:32] memo keeper said is
[09:23:34] true and that
[09:23:37] acaron who knows what she intends to do
[09:23:40] next they're only going to have one
[09:23:42] sock oh it's done okay that wasn't that
[09:23:45] bad that was cool please
[09:23:48] don't I don't intend to okay um that's
[09:23:53] not what the [ __ ] to
[09:23:56] you did you
[09:23:58] know people who come to the land of
[09:24:02] dreams for the first time they'll
[09:24:05] subconsciously stop to reaffirm that
[09:24:09] they're still walking on Solid
[09:24:13] Ground and then they will unanimously
[09:24:16] raised their heads to gaze at the sky
[09:24:23] be it reality or
[09:24:26] dream staring at the sky is instinctual
[09:24:31] for
[09:24:33] Humanity since the day that the golden
[09:24:36] hour was
[09:24:38] completed it's always been
[09:24:41] there watching over every single night
[09:24:45] of this is actually [ __ ] this should
[09:24:49] be
[09:24:50] illegal has been
[09:24:54] mercilessly died with the m of
[09:24:58] nity and this whole event hey this is in
[09:25:02] the previous stream I remember within
[09:25:04] the course you guys were like spoiled on
[09:25:07] of a
[09:25:09] blade a single splash of a
[09:25:12] blade isn't really
[09:25:14] accurate it was actually two blades just
[09:25:17] that the second one was
[09:25:19] faster wait doesn't her also have three
[09:25:21] slices though technically four with
[09:25:23] explosion well three and then explosion
[09:25:25] okay any many guests who weren't
[09:25:27] supposed to be invited have gathered at
[09:25:31] this
[09:25:32] banquet even if the harmony is all
[09:25:37] embracing I have no choice but to show
[09:25:40] some of them the
[09:25:42] door for the sake of
[09:25:46] Pon and the
[09:25:50] peace the planet of festivities has no
[09:25:54] place for you a puppet of
[09:25:58] nity speaking of living in the shadows
[09:26:02] there's probably not much difference
[09:26:03] between us it's only polite to reveal
[09:26:07] your true self at least when speaking to
[09:26:10] others penton's dream
[09:26:12] master oh
[09:26:17] [ __ ] that's just another reason that you
[09:26:21] can't stay
[09:26:24] whether you believe it or not this is
[09:26:28] the real
[09:26:31] me we are
[09:26:33] [Music]
[09:26:36] one is this the unity of the family of
[09:26:40] spouses my mortal sh has long since
[09:26:45] dissipated the oak family's 107,000
[09:26:52] 36 offspring are now my eyes ears and
[09:26:57] mouths spreading Joy across dreams when
[09:27:02] required and in times of essential need
[09:27:07] exiling evil from this Haven in
[09:27:11] my I feel like some of the VA said steed
[09:27:14] and others said stead so it made like a
[09:27:15] weird last word am I am I am I am I
[09:27:18] coping from the sound of it it seems
[09:27:20] like you're asking me to leave pacon
[09:27:24] I am glad you're an understanding
[09:27:28] one
[09:27:30] alas I'm not
[09:27:33] asking if you think you
[09:27:37] can are you threatening
[09:27:42] me I ended it with a period it was a
[09:27:46] statement not a
[09:27:48] threat okay knowing who I am and still
[09:27:51] showing such malice you're not the first
[09:27:54] nor will you be the
[09:27:56] last this scene played out many times
[09:27:59] before and usually when faced with my
[09:28:01] questions most people retort why can't I
[09:28:05] English teacher
[09:28:07] acaron the result has invariably been
[09:28:10] that they
[09:28:11] can't you are
[09:28:14] confident but be
[09:28:17] reminded the family is
[09:28:20] forgiving but not we
[09:28:23] the Cordes of the harmony extend across
[09:28:27] worlds if you do not
[09:28:30] comply when the blade is unshed for even
[09:28:34] a hair's breath you will never be able
[09:28:38] to escape the Eternal centurion's wrath
[09:28:43] in all of your
[09:28:46] lifetime
[09:28:48] 137
[09:28:50] individuals that is how many
[09:28:53] I have exiled since I became dream
[09:28:56] master among them were those who once
[09:29:00] SED my wings and those
[09:29:04] imated my body I mean okay okay and here
[09:29:09] I stand
[09:29:11] again about to add another
[09:29:15] Mark and you will
[09:29:18] die I mean all of you will
[09:29:29] that won't come to pass H I'll do as you
[09:29:32] ask I'll leave a wise
[09:29:38] choice I wasn't aware there was a choice
[09:29:42] to you that surely is the only
[09:29:46] option please bear in mind you and Pen
[09:29:51] are different
[09:29:53] worlds those born on the far Bank cannot
[09:29:57] seek Solace across the river leave and
[09:30:02] never
[09:30:04] return the radi of the planet of
[09:30:07] festivities is overwhelmingly bright
[09:30:11] luring in tricksters wrongdoers and
[09:30:15] criminals but even the harmony itself
[09:30:19] will never never welcome the self
[09:30:23] Annihilator of
[09:30:26] nil and even more so when this no one
[09:30:30] ask anator Heralds the destruction of
[09:30:35] everything your strength is obviously a
[09:30:38] gift of the sleeping and shapeless
[09:30:41] immeasurable and fathomless like a
[09:30:44] tributary Spawn from the abyss that
[09:30:48] brings death and sin to Oh
[09:30:54] Aaron a beting name okay it's over
[09:30:58] now take it from someone on the other
[09:31:00] side of your socalled
[09:31:02] River you know better than I do that
[09:31:05] penacon has already deviated from the
[09:31:07] harmony whatever your intentions may
[09:31:11] be I foresee only one
[09:31:15] outcome its future holds nothing but
[09:31:20] nihility just like all the world that
[09:31:22] have drowned in their sh this is a good
[09:31:24] point to end the cut scene but there's
[09:31:25] also a chance the watch is like ah the
[09:31:28] what the outcome is the side okay cool
[09:31:30] thank God switching to Robin's POV isn't
[09:31:34] she dead shouldn't just be a black
[09:31:35] [ __ ]
[09:31:36] screen attention please the unusual
[09:31:39] event that occurred moments ago was due

[09:33:50] mark okay wait so I'm done okay let's
[09:33:53] calm down so we're done the 2.1 right
[09:33:55] what the [ __ ] happened with blood hound
[09:33:58] what's his name Gallagher I mean it
[09:33:59] looked like he [ __ ] silver wolfed
[09:34:01] himself but unless he killed Sunday I
[09:34:03] don't know actually he probably killed
[09:34:04] Sunday but why was the blood blue is it
[09:34:06] just censorship I mean I guess 2.2 is
[09:34:09] yeah we could just keep doing it okay
[09:34:11] that was good uh we'll we'll do 2.2
[09:34:13] tomorrow or like in a I mean technically
[09:34:15] tomorrow I don't know not today it's
[09:34:17] [ __ ] 9:00 a.m. how long is 2.2 like 5
[09:34:19] hours 7 it actually looks like seven I
[09:34:22] can't lie 8 hours what are your thoughts
[09:34:24] on the quest I thought it was really
[09:34:26] good uh did I yeah I mean all the
[09:34:29] adventuring stuff I think is really cool
[09:34:30] I like that character low key I feel
[09:34:32] like I could have guessed 80% of what I
[09:34:34] feel like I was gapping okay I was
[09:34:36] joking about how he's the [ __ ] Kida
[09:34:38] dude from donga he literally is like he
[09:34:40] literally is just lucky [ __ ] student
[09:34:42] but also a mixture of child where he
[09:34:44] like cares about his family but his
[09:34:45] family got [ __ ] murdered like like
[09:34:47] destroyed and he's like sad boy lament
[09:34:49] cuz his whole [ __ ] family Clan is
[09:34:51] dead don't compare them to that rat Kida
[09:34:53] is my goat [ __ ] you okay no okay I like
[09:34:56] 2.1 I'm GNA be honest I mean I knew the
[09:34:58] Firefly Sam thing but I did not expect
[09:35:01] the Gallagher thing I'm kind of trying
[09:35:02] to process what that means Gallagher is
[09:35:04] cuz it was kind of a lot of yapping that
[09:35:06] I wasn't ready for and I couldn't go
[09:35:07] back and think about it because I got
[09:35:09] [ __ ] forced into a 20-minute
[09:35:10] unskippable cut scene for some [ __ ]
[09:35:12] reason so that was pretty crazy cuz it
[09:35:14] was also like no characters it could
[09:35:15] have like there's like no relevant
[09:35:17] characters to the plot so it was just
[09:35:18] like oh well it's [ __ ] Gallagher but

[09:37:54] we got stun locked for 20 minutes and
[09:37:56] Sparkle we were in Sparkle
[09:38:00] POV the fix theam title they would
[09:38:03] protect the guests within the Dreamscape
[09:38:06] but witness the group of organic life
[09:38:09] forms making their way to the theme park
[09:38:12] and soon after a rip tore through the
[09:38:15] sky and Black Rain started leaking out
[09:38:18] of the
[09:38:20] Void the family needs to provide a
[09:38:23] reasonable explanation it appears the
[09:38:25] good sir has seen many great events
[09:38:28] how's volume that an Uninvited Guest has
[09:38:30] unexpectedly entered the
[09:38:32] Dreamscape however their target is not
[09:38:36] the ordinary guests but the ambassadors
[09:38:38] of the IPC the music's a little loud
[09:38:42] ensure that the safety of the guests is
[09:38:44] of the highest importance miss Robin I
[09:38:47] know the blood hound family has already
[09:38:50] sealed off the Park and has control over
[09:38:53] the situation the family can try their
[09:38:56] best to protect their reputation but as
[09:38:58] you can see sir no innocent bystanders
[09:39:01] were affected in this incident perhaps
[09:39:03] the Dreamscape is not as perfect as
[09:39:05] promised but there's no place safer than
[09:39:08] dreams under the family's wall yeah I'll
[09:39:10] turn Robin's voice up after let me get
[09:39:13] through this stay here but keep in mind
[09:39:16] guests come to penone to enjoy the
[09:39:18] dreamcap want a conflict yep of course
[09:39:21] the CH Festival I'm not going to skip
[09:39:23] anything important but I'm trying to
[09:39:24] it's like a [ __ ] yearlong Quest we're
[09:39:26] trying to get through some of the NPC
[09:39:28] stuff our apologies the family has
[09:39:30] arranged this gift for the guests thank
[09:39:33] you for understanding
[09:39:36] Sparkle so I'm just assuming we're
[09:39:38] Sparkle cosplaying Robin let me do one
[09:39:41] down on music and then one up on voice
[09:39:43] maybe two up on voice like
[09:39:45] this hello may I ask what happened

[09:39:57] fool hey are you a fool Robin wait
[09:40:00] you're the the sparkle [ __ ]
[09:40:02] sorry I I'm sorry I I've just been
[09:40:06] transferred to the blood hound family
[09:40:08] and I'm still not too used to working on
[09:40:10] the streets I didn't realize it was you
[09:40:13] I I'm so
[09:40:15] sorry hey don't sweat it you guys have a
[09:40:19] tough job
[09:40:21] we've sealed off the theme park true
[09:40:24] rest assured miss Robin will intensify
[09:40:26] our controls to ensure that no incidents
[09:40:28] occur I trust you guys but regarding
[09:40:32] what happened in the theme park well
[09:40:35] time having this 4 hours 50 that's okay
[09:40:38] feel free to speak your mind what do you
[09:40:41] hounds think about it well actually I
[09:40:45] was there shortly after it happened is
[09:40:48] it true that the ipc's ambassadors came
[09:40:51] with ill
[09:40:52] intent miss Robin tell you the truth
[09:40:56] everyone's been talking about it the
[09:40:58] Myriad factions on pentacon have already
[09:41:00] been causing unease for everyone thank
[09:41:02] you all for your loyalty towards the
[09:41:04] family okay the planet of festivities
[09:41:06] has run into some trouble totally
[09:41:10] representative from the
[09:41:11] IPC he's trying to regain ownership of
[09:41:14] pentacon and is prepared for a hostile
[09:41:16] takeover of course the family did not
[09:41:19] agree sad I
[09:41:22] I'll go to sleep res sleep res sleeper
[09:41:26] no
[09:41:27] wonder the main reason why the IPC stat
[09:41:30] okay if you make it till the end of the
[09:41:31] quest I'll review you did they have the
[09:41:33] Troublemaker in the end sorry don't
[09:41:36] worry Mr Sunday is currently tracking
[09:41:38] his whereabouts and he'll have something
[09:41:40] to show for it
[09:41:41] soon however given the situation the IPC
[09:41:45] surely won't let this go easily
[09:41:48] therefore we are relying on you hounds
[09:41:50] to maintain the order inability of the
[09:41:51] dreamcap please be assured miss Robin we
[09:41:54] take our orders seriously we won't let
[09:41:57] those IPC cronies get away with this
[09:42:00] what is
[09:42:02] a any other members who uneasy please
[09:42:05] tell them on my behalf that protecting
[09:42:07] the Dreamscape requires everyone's help

[09:43:06] Festival preparation is important yeah

[09:43:15] chance to sing with everyone I will not
[09:43:19] refuse it's like half a real
[09:43:22] almost I understand it negatively
[09:43:24] impacted some of our
[09:43:25] guests but uh are you sure it was
[09:43:29] actually iname voice is too low I'll

[09:43:33] descending like rain and the red light
[09:43:35] tearing through the sky claiming it was
[09:43:37] merely special effects seems a bit
[09:43:40] farfetched plus I met that generous
[09:43:42] gentleman he looked really out of it and
[09:43:45] kept talking to himself everyone please
[09:43:48] do not panic I believe that the family
[09:43:51] will give everyone a satisfactory answer

[09:44:33] climax press the button together with
[09:44:36] the others around
[09:44:38] you you never know something very
[09:44:42] exciting might happen okay sure thing
[09:44:49] Sparkle we're back to Where it All
[09:44:52] Began you entered the golden hour from
[09:44:55] this place
[09:44:56] Firefly and it is also from here where
[09:44:59] you will enter the true okay no spoilers
[09:45:01] please but if Firefly dies I'm going to
[09:45:03] be
[09:45:05] M it is a pleasure to Journey alongside
[09:45:09] you once
[09:45:12] more but it's time I laid bear the
[09:45:15] entire truth before
[09:45:18] you as you might have heard
[09:45:22] I also go by another
[09:45:25] name stellon Hunter yeah I saw the drip
[09:45:28] marketing I know I saw the Dre Maring
[09:45:29] you lied to me I'm
[09:45:33] sorry I had no other choice I know you
[09:45:37] have many
[09:45:39] questions do you remember when we
[09:45:41] encountered death in that strange dream
[09:45:44] SC I do I do when I was caught by that
[09:45:46] Meme the meme in that instant before it
[09:45:50] killed me
[09:45:52] I saw the reflection of another
[09:45:54] Dreamscape in its ghastly
[09:45:56] pupils so following the clues in the
[09:46:00] script I came up with some theories
[09:46:01] about the
[09:46:03] meme that's why are the pauses so longed
[09:46:05] silver wolf to
[09:46:08] invitations drawing everyone to the
[09:46:11] dreams
[09:46:12] Hotel okay I intended to call upon death
[09:46:15] before you
[09:46:17] arrived to Solve the Riddle using more
[09:46:20] direct
[09:46:21] means and then invite you to
[09:46:24] join however contrary to my wishes I
[09:46:28] couldn't defy the
[09:46:30] script and I I didn't get a chance to
[09:46:33] explain it to you okay I'm following
[09:46:35] this is how you see now I was impaled by
[09:46:39] the bladed wings of death the heavy
[09:46:42] pressure of concentrated Memoria my
[09:46:46] asthma exploded in my mind as if it was
[09:46:50] actually reality but after the momentary
[09:46:54] numbness
[09:46:56] subsided I found that my body was
[09:46:59] absolutely unscathed I was still
[09:47:03] alive and it was just as I thought I I
[09:47:06] had arrived at a place Darkly different
[09:47:08] from this beautiful dream beneath the
[09:47:11] Dreamscape of paniconi Lies another more
[09:47:14] chaotic more Primal memory Zone its name
[09:47:20] land of the Exiles that of the Exiles
[09:47:23] and so then I returned to the hotel in
[09:47:25] the Dreamscape hoping to tell you of its
[09:47:29] existence yet I I I could not reveal my
[09:47:33] own
[09:47:34] identity so I could only divert your
[09:47:37] party's attention and lure you away from
[09:47:39] the
[09:47:40] battlefield okay
[09:47:43] after all my attempts proved futile
[09:47:46] gambling it wasn't until not long ago
[09:47:51] when a crimson blade of light shattered
[09:47:54] the high wall of the
[09:47:55] dream causing you all to fall far into
[09:47:58] the epistle depths of the
[09:48:01] Dreamscape that I was able to awaken you
[09:48:04] and your companions one by one okay and
[09:48:07] and that's it that is all that's
[09:48:08] happened so far I completely understand
[09:48:11] I know it's tough to believe all this
[09:48:13] without
[09:48:16] reservations I just want to say okay the
[09:48:19] pauses have to be a bog by the way sorry
[09:48:21] close to the final
[09:48:24] answer just one more thing needs to be
[09:48:28] done and then I can prove it to you
[09:48:31] now let's leave this
[09:48:35] place please close your eyes okay take a
[09:48:40] deep
[09:48:41] breath and visualize the Dreamscapes
[09:48:44] outline in
[09:48:47] heart and
[09:48:49] remember you must not open your eyes
[09:48:52] times [ __ ] sorry I won't
[09:48:54] three
[09:48:56] two
[09:48:58] one don't be afraid can I open the one
[09:49:02] who has come to oh [ __ ]
[09:49:04] sorry has
[09:49:12] arrived who [ __ ] stop stop stop this
[09:49:14] told me close your eyes after a fusing
[09:49:16] Screech a thick and ferocious surge of
[09:49:17] memoral crashes into your chest churning
[09:49:19] and ravaging your Consciousness becomes
[09:49:21] like scraps of paper caught in a
[09:49:22] Whirlpool breaking apart dissolving and
[09:49:24] dispersing within the turbulent muddy
[09:49:26] current innumerate voices resonated
[09:49:29] through the Symphony of Memoria like
[09:49:30] roaring Thunder and among them one Echo
[09:49:32] stood out with exceptional Clarity you
[09:49:33] knew it came from the girl beside you
[09:49:35] your heart beating to the same Rhythm
[09:49:36] peaceful and even more peaceful welcome
[09:49:39] to my until in that quiet Darkness
[09:49:41] memories Ripple into
[09:49:43] existence dot dot dot I never knew you

[09:50:38] You'
[09:50:39] like there's still some time before part
[09:50:42] of the script
[09:50:45] unfolds let me stay a little longer in
[09:50:48] this
[09:50:49] body along silence and Sho neither of
[09:50:51] them brought up any topic seemingly
[09:50:52] accustomed to this silence it wasn't
[09:50:54] until much later that a soft sigh once
[09:50:56] again broke the quiet in the car such a
[09:50:57] long
[09:51:01] tunnel didn't feel this long when I set
[09:51:04] off in half a system hour it will lead
[09:51:07] us to
[09:51:08] Kafka and then comes the downfall of the
[09:51:10] jaella
[09:51:12] Brotherhood is that also part of the
[09:51:15] script it's in your script too
[09:51:18] sorry I didn't notice
[09:51:22] their Destiny won't change just because

[09:53:46] you're not doing
[09:53:48] anything sorry
[09:53:50] glad to see you're safe and sound Mr
[09:53:52] Yang you're here too close your eyes
[09:53:54] wait what just happened hello why she
[09:53:57] just this is the answer that was a sharp
[09:54:00] turn isn't it
[09:54:02] incredible the monster that we have
[09:54:05] always known as
[09:54:07] death is actually the guardian of the
[09:54:10] land of the
[09:54:13] Exiles it abides by a certain
[09:54:16] Rule abducting people from their dreams
[09:54:19] and bringing them here
[09:54:21] the question that has been perplexing us
[09:54:24] does death really exist in the
[09:54:26] Dreamscape yes appears to be a cognitive
[09:54:30] trap it was laid by those orchestrating
[09:54:33] events from the Shadows to cover up the
[09:54:35] truth behind the disappearances and the
[09:54:38] existence of this Fortress known as
[09:54:40] dream flux Reef okay every emergence of
[09:54:44] that Meme is related to the watch maker
[09:54:48] since dreamlux reef is where it brings
[09:54:50] its captives it's likely that many of
[09:54:53] our long-standing questions will be
[09:54:55] answered in this place the atmosphere
[09:54:59] here is Darkly different from the
[09:55:00] beautiful
[09:55:02] dream there are no Regulators here like
[09:55:05] the
[09:55:06] family and they all look like they're
[09:55:09] mildly dazed but from The Whispers of
[09:55:11] the
[09:55:12] residents they've heard a familiar
[09:55:16] Gallagher
[09:55:18] Gallagher it's that man again
[09:55:20] always in the right place at the right
[09:55:23] time though that does save us the
[09:55:25] trouble of looking for
[09:55:27] him heo and March have already made a
[09:55:30] move get ready we're about I should
[09:55:33] probably rewatch The the last scene of
[09:55:35] 2.1 real dream I kind of forgot what
[09:55:37] happened the
[09:55:39] Exiles hey Firefly before we go should
[09:55:42] we speak to everyone
[09:55:45] first I'm really sorry for waiting until
[09:55:48] now to tell you everything
[09:55:50] why can't you reveal your true identity
[09:55:52] well isn't that what you just said two
[09:55:55] reasons firstly the
[09:55:58] script in the future that Elio
[09:56:01] saw Sam and the astral Express's
[09:56:04] confrontation was
[09:56:08] inevitable I that
[09:56:12] aside thank you so who's Sam do you
[09:56:16] still remember that medical cabin I told
[09:56:19] you about
[09:56:21] yeah
[09:56:23] well that's
[09:56:25] Sam it belongs to the iron Cavalry of
[09:56:29] glo's firmament front
[09:56:31] line a firefly type four tactical heavy
[09:56:36] assault Mech strategical assault Mech
[09:56:38] that's what it stands for crad let me
[09:56:40] write that down cuz it's going to be in
[09:56:41] some trivia game show and the meaning of
[09:56:45] my
[09:56:48] birth the longest time it was
[09:56:53] is what does Sam stand for strategic
[09:56:56] assault me diff from correct one
[09:57:02] point cool I should probably play a
[09:57:04] character that explores faster wait I
[09:57:07] just what did I just
[09:57:09] do notice I click top left trying to
[09:57:11] skip cuz of [ __ ] waa what's our
[09:57:13] exporation team do I have one lagging
[09:57:16] okay hello hello hello hello hello hello
[09:57:19] hello hello hello hello hello hello
[09:57:22] hello hello hello wait who's the fastest
[09:57:24] to run around with I need you could do
[09:57:26] yukong OT Lune sely for invis dill no
[09:57:31] just do Dill oh yeah Sparkle can too
[09:57:33] okay let me just put a Healer we got a
[09:57:40] team what heat the CL
[09:57:44] song
[09:57:46] Oh What a huge Clocky what a huge [ __ ]
[09:57:51] also his mark on dream flux what the
[09:57:53] [ __ ]
[09:57:59] well what's
[09:58:08] this
[09:58:10] unbelievable to think there's a
[09:58:12] settlement of this size within the
[09:58:15] Dreamscape and all beyond the family's
[09:58:17] reach
[09:58:21] I'm going to turn this to five is this
[09:58:25] louder the atmosphere in this Fortress
[09:58:27] is pretty different from that in the
[09:58:30] beautiful dream when I first saw
[09:58:33] it I was in awe
[09:58:36] too the sky here it's like is that a
[09:58:40] three star a reflection of the 12
[09:58:43] Dreamscapes what's even more bizarre is
[09:58:46] that this place is also separated into
[09:58:48] trade and residential
[09:58:51] areas the layout may be simple I don't
[09:58:53] trust clock let the record show before
[09:58:56] we do the quest it seems that there are
[09:58:59] quite a number of people living here I
[09:59:02] don't trust Clocky I don't trust Misha
[09:59:03] Dreamscapes have distinct styles theal
[09:59:07] designs are quite similar works of the
[09:59:10] same hand perhaps hard not to speculate
[09:59:13] on the
[09:59:17] connection but there's no point in
[09:59:19] overthinking things let's meet up with
[09:59:21] himo and the others first take a right
[09:59:24] turn at the end of this road and you'll
[09:59:26] reach the trade thanks Firefly not
[09:59:28] coming with
[09:59:29] us the astral Express likely needs room
[09:59:32] for some internal
[09:59:35] deliberation sure let's reconnect later
[09:59:39] dude what did they do look look oh wait
[09:59:41] was the right decision further
[09:59:43] observations are wait Misha's in the
[09:59:44] back with Clocky wait a second but first
[09:59:47] there's did I just summon him into
[09:59:49] existence
[09:59:50] let's go I'm sure you've already noticed
[09:59:53] him who look over there the Ry hotel's
[09:59:58] Bellboy how did he end up here and right
[10:00:02] after Miss acaron severed the beautiful
[10:00:04] dream he heard you talking [ __ ] we'd
[10:00:07] better check just to be sure no cuz look
[10:00:10] look look look the only thing that what
[10:00:12] the [ __ ] why is there a kid in the trash
[10:00:14] legal for me to stay in honestly based
[10:00:16] what dude I literally look I got Loki
[10:00:18] one of the Lyon spoils spoils me uh
[10:00:21] which lyone is it it's probably
[10:00:22] destruction or was it Harmony it might
[10:00:23] be Harmony I think Robin can use it
[10:00:25] right
[10:00:26] yeah hello do look like Misha's dad is
[10:00:29] this Michael also now that I was looking
[10:00:31] through them though in
[10:00:33] destruction no it's just Misha soon
[10:00:35] you'll be able to go to a larger world
[10:00:37] the boy happily accepted his inheritance
[10:00:39] inheritance of course before that time
[10:00:40] comes however guard this place well
[10:00:43] Misha the hands of the compass keep
[10:00:45] turning until they point to the moment
[10:00:47] of Dreams the asdon system overflowing
[10:00:49] with Memorial glows of the soft light
[10:00:50] outside the Train's Windows hey guys
[10:00:52] what do you suppose the world within the
[10:00:53] dream would look like I must
[10:00:55] meticulously map it out the girl packing
[10:00:57] away her surveying tools gazes at the
[10:01:00] new world within reach F anticipation
[10:01:02] that place is a mess don't you run off
[10:01:03] once we get in there I won't have you
[10:01:04] two getting kidnapped again the man in
[10:01:06] the cowboy attire grumbles as he cleans
[10:01:09] his weapon then walks over to the sofa
[10:01:11] with a drink shaking his head in
[10:01:12] resignation the line of the dreams
[10:01:14] promises infinite possibilities will
[10:01:15] surely make our Mark hey conductor if we
[10:01:17] fall in love with that place and never
[10:01:18] return would you miss us the nameless
[10:01:20] dresses like a gentleman nameless dress
[10:01:22] like a gentleman Winks at pom pom
[10:01:24] smiling you can't joke at the
[10:01:25] conductor's expense like this is that
[10:01:27] what you want to say conductor the
[10:01:28] girl's M stous grin spreads across her
[10:01:30] face you guys are so mean the bubbles
[10:01:32] drift up and down in the glass as the
[10:01:34] express fills up with joyful laughter
[10:01:35] the youthful silhouettes of these
[10:01:36] nameless get gradually swallowed by
[10:01:38] Memoria have a slave trip please when
[10:01:40] the conductor turns their head the
[10:01:41] express is already empty the conductor
[10:01:42] stands Frozen this time hauntingly
[10:01:44] familiar as if lived through countless
[10:01:47] times
[10:01:48] before be
[10:01:51] I just passed my bachelor's exams could
[10:01:55] I get a congrats from my second favorite

[10:02:28] five you're wait well can
[10:02:34] see nope Clocky is a good friend of mine
[10:02:38] we all live here how did you two get
[10:02:42] here this Dreamscape isn't supposed to
[10:02:44] be open to the
[10:02:46] public I wonder if it has something to
[10:02:50] do with
[10:02:50] sleepy so this is your home yep after my
[10:02:56] work in the beautiful dream ends I'll go
[10:02:58] back home commuting used to be more
[10:03:01] convenient but ever since travel became
[10:03:04] cumbersome sleepy started fing people
[10:03:07] back and forth between the two
[10:03:08] Dreamscapes this
[10:03:11] sleepy can you describe what it looks
[10:03:14] like sleepy is a memory Zone name looks
[10:03:17] Fierce and has many eyes but it's
[10:03:20] actually really well behaved been taking
[10:03:23] care of it Gallagher again based on the
[10:03:26] description that Meme is indisputably
[10:03:30] death nightmare for the family but for
[10:03:33] the people who live here well that
[10:03:36] couldn't be further from the truth death
[10:03:39] not in a dream surely sleep is just a
[10:03:42] little aggressive and sometimes messes
[10:03:45] up by fetching the wrong guest but it
[10:03:47] would never hurt anyone I
[10:03:50] see has it brought back any guests
[10:03:53] recently say in the last day or two
[10:03:57] we're currently investigating a missing
[10:03:59] person case that occurred within the
[10:04:00] beautiful dream I see then you'll have
[10:04:04] to speak with Gallagher I'm sure he's
[10:04:06] very busy he is currently busy hosting a
[10:04:08] visitor from the oak family and
[10:04:10] specifically asked not to be
[10:04:12] disturbed um Mr Yang the person you're
[10:04:16] looking for is it Miss Robin
[10:04:20] just as I thought considering what
[10:04:22] happened with Miss Firefly this doesn't
[10:04:24] come as a surprise if you're looking for
[10:04:27] Miss Robin I can lead the way she told
[10:04:30] me that she'd be willing to meet with
[10:04:32] outside guests yo thanks if it's not too
[10:04:36] much
[10:04:37] trouble also we're looking for our
[10:04:40] missing companions um a woman with red
[10:04:43] hair a companied by wait him's missing
[10:04:46] seen sorry I forgot 2.1 sorry oh I I
[10:04:50] haven't but please rest assured dreamlux
[10:04:54] reef is a small place and it's not as
[10:04:56] bustling as the I saw a tweet that was
[10:04:58] like Koko will be imaginary
[10:05:01] soon how about this since it's your
[10:05:03] first time here in dreamlux Reef I'll be
[10:05:06] your guide and help you find your
[10:05:07] companions and then we can all go visit
[10:05:09] miss Robin together she's gone to Mrs
[10:05:12] Grace's to visit the children she won't
[10:05:14] be there all right then we'll uh follow
[10:05:16] your plan the re month Le 15 at this we
[10:05:20] now know the answer to both murdered
[10:05:22] cases that have caused such commotion in
[10:05:24] pentacon yeah as for the intentions of
[10:05:27] The Mastermind behind it all we are
[10:05:30] still none the
[10:05:32] wiser that name sleepy uh no
[10:05:37] idea but its connection to Gallagher is
[10:05:40] worth digging into regardless we have to
[10:05:43] find
[10:05:45] him say you mentioned before that you
[10:05:48] saw clock it it was actually only those
[10:05:51] with innocent or pure hearts which is
[10:05:53] why children and me could see them but
[10:05:54] now you can too Mr Yang I can't shake
[10:05:57] off this strange feeling therefore
[10:06:00] you're pure at heart you really still so
[10:06:02] young at heart forget it it's not
[10:06:05] important uh we'd better just follow
[10:06:09] Misha
[10:06:15] okay everyone look from here you can see
[10:06:19] see the most spectacular view of
[10:06:21] dreamlux
[10:06:23] reef a black hole that's the abyss
[10:06:25] that's the abyss portal musk Reef F disc
[10:06:28] formed from Consolidated
[10:06:31] memoral was dreamlux Reef built on such
[10:06:34] unstable Memorial oh so Mr Yang is also
[10:06:39] versed in Memoria Dynamics I was just
[10:06:41] trying to figure out how to explain this
[10:06:43] huge hole to everyone I bet you guys
[10:06:46] have a lot in common with Miss Cy
[10:06:51] every time they say Memoria I'm going to
[10:06:52] take a shot whoa the Memoria is so
[10:06:58] unstable my calculations are finally
[10:07:01] done in another I to refresh mys the
[10:07:05] above dream will swallow the dream below
[10:07:08] my hypothesis was correct this place
[10:07:10] will cease to exist as the dream devours
[10:07:15] everything who are you all and why
[10:07:17] haven't you left yet
[10:07:19] who are you I'm Cy a Dreamscape surveyor
[10:07:22] specializing in Memoria Dynamics and
[10:07:25] this life's work that I'm
[10:07:27] researching you see that huge gaping
[10:07:29] hole it was just a narrow Rift many
[10:07:32] years ago but now it's grown into a
[10:07:35] giant hole the surrounding Memoria has
[10:07:37] been flowing towards the other end of
[10:07:39] the hole at a constant velocity slow
[10:07:42] ohia again
[10:07:44] surely but the scary part is according
[10:07:47] to my calculations the rate of Memoria
[10:07:50] has recently changed and it's faster
[10:07:53] than ever before it's almost almost as
[10:07:56] if something is sucking it in from The
[10:07:58] Other Side by constantly improving upon
[10:08:01] Madame Rosalina's Memoria measurement
[10:08:03] method I've finally obtained accurate
[10:08:06] results after 10 system hours the dream
[10:08:10] flux reap will cease to exist just like
[10:08:13] the melting of glaciers everything will
[10:08:16] crumble and disintegrate the dreams on
[10:08:19] that side of the Void will fuse into one
[10:08:22] uh please don't worry this sort of thing
[10:08:25] has happened many times before Miss Hy
[10:08:29] isn't a bad person she's just a bit lost
[10:08:34] in her own
[10:08:35] world you don't
[10:08:37] say there was a something else Rosalina
[10:08:41] Interest
[10:08:42] Who roselina oh do you know her too or
[10:08:47] are you also a fan of Memoria dynamic
[10:08:51] we're very interested in Madame
[10:08:53] Rosalina's achievements uh could you
[10:08:56] tell us a little more about
[10:08:58] them why of course she's an excellent
[10:09:01] scholar of Memoria Dynamics and the
[10:09:04] first person to apply Memorial rate
[10:09:07] measurement methodology on Interstellar
[10:09:09] Travelers regrettably due to the
[10:09:12] presence of the garden of recollection
[10:09:14] ordinary people don't pay much attention
[10:09:16] to the Nature's Memoria she Departed
[10:09:19] this world without much Fame leaving
[10:09:21] only a few thin journals behind I came
[10:09:24] to pone to learn more about my Idol and
[10:09:27] went to Great Lengths to seek out
[10:09:29] dreamlux Reef all because this is her
[10:09:31] final resting place prodigies always
[10:09:34] meet their demise prematurely if only
[10:09:37] Madame roselina had more time she would
[10:09:39] have discovered a way to reverse the
[10:09:41] flow of
[10:09:42] Memoria I felt it the source is in the
[10:09:46] golden hour there is a certain anomalous
[10:09:49] presence stirring the currents of the
[10:09:51] memory Zone I must uncover more concrete
[10:09:54] proof I must convince
[10:09:57] everyone does the
[10:09:59] nameena sound familiar to you um yeah of
[10:10:03] course it was one of the namelists uh
[10:10:04] mentioned by the conductor if I remember
[10:10:05] correctly that's right yeah seems like
[10:10:08] she did a great deal of research and
[10:10:10] calculations in dream flux
[10:10:12] Reef before abruptly passing away oh
[10:10:16] miss kie regularly mentions her I hear
[10:10:20] Madame ralina passed away during the
[10:10:22] prison
[10:10:23] War she could see the pentacon of
[10:10:27] today she'd be really happy perhaps our
[10:10:30] destinational district that's where the
[10:10:33] largest crowds gather and dream where we
[10:10:35] going oh should I have this unlocked
[10:10:38] already sorry we might be able to find
[10:10:40] the other
[10:10:42] thing is that March hi March where's
[10:10:45] hoko
[10:10:46] though oh my I'm human and so are you
[10:10:50] can you get a
[10:10:51] grip Mr Yang and Miss Trailblazer I've
[10:10:55] been waiting for you quickly come help I
[10:10:58] bumped into a member of the family on
[10:11:00] the way here he was so scared and I just
[10:11:03] wanted to calm him down but let me go
[10:11:07] let me go I've only done good in my life
[10:11:11] well this is how it turned out now you
[10:11:13] shall pay respect to March 7th ghost of
[10:11:16] dream flux Reef me a ghost don't make me
[10:11:20] hit you oh sorry he thinks he's
[10:11:23] dead although when I first fell in I
[10:11:26] also thought the same dear guest this is
[10:11:30] not the afterlife this is dreamlux Reef
[10:11:34] that's right did you hear that repeat
[10:11:37] after me
[10:11:39] dream
[10:11:41] Reef you're talking to someone
[10:11:44] invisible if I'm not dead what am I I
[10:11:47] should have pushed my luck and try
[10:11:48] sleeping in my dream
[10:11:49] what's wrong with sleeping in dreams
[10:11:51] stop asking oh is it like the nether you
[10:11:54] like when you put a bed and you try to
[10:11:55] sleep in the nether it blows up and you
[10:11:56] die I remember you're not talking about
[10:11:58] the memory Zone meme are you don't say
[10:12:02] that name it's all your
[10:12:05] fault wait what
[10:12:09] hello what the [ __ ] wait my team comp is
[10:12:12] wait yo my team is not
[10:12:15] yo okay
[10:12:21] he passed out his intense negative
[10:12:24] emotions attracted the nearby memory
[10:12:26] Zone memes I see but why aren't the
[10:12:31] other people around here scared unlike
[10:12:33] in the sweet dream people here don't see
[10:12:36] memory Zone memes as dangerous Monsters
[10:12:39] And even if they pose a threat people
[10:12:41] can easily Escape by forcing a wakeup
[10:12:43] call but we can't just leave this man
[10:12:46] here wake up call like Discord or safe
[10:12:49] is there a peny Discord group chat dude
[10:12:52] I wonder if that group chat gets leaked
[10:12:54] what do you think Sparkle's been saying
[10:12:56] everyone here is living a
[10:12:57] self-sufficient life I don't know how to
[10:13:00] describe it but this place feels like
[10:13:03] the real
[10:13:05] Dreamscape a stroke of Genius like
[10:13:10] this evening Jesse um is it evening
[10:13:15] welcome Miss March who might these be
[10:13:18] these two are my friends as for the man
[10:13:22] lying on the ground uh he's a
[10:13:24] scaredy-cat who fainted from
[10:13:27] Fright I see another poor guy who
[10:13:30] accidentally ended up here I'll take
[10:13:32] care of him Sparkle has skeletons there
[10:13:34] been a lot of new faces lately things
[10:13:37] must be tough in this
[10:13:38] dream the few remaining havens of
[10:13:41] freedom and asna will soon face trouble
[10:13:43] do such things often happen here not
[10:13:46] really but they're becoming more
[10:13:47] frequent now
[10:13:49] guess it's one of the signs of the sweet
[10:13:51] dreams collapse this man has had quite
[10:13:53] the
[10:13:54] shock could you help me find a halian
[10:13:57] lady March her songs can heal mental
[10:13:59] wounds Chad what do you think the new
[10:14:01] March's name is going to be is it going
[10:14:02] to be is it going to be March 8th or
[10:14:04] June
[10:14:05] 7th that must be Robin she's also here
[10:14:09] in dreamlux Reef huh Robin but I thought
[10:14:14] she oh right if March 7th sound then it
[10:14:20] means Robin must be okay too Robin's
[10:14:23] okay about to take us to her to find out
[10:14:25] what happened but before that let's meet
[10:14:28] up with himo you were with her earlier
[10:14:30] right we met some stowaways in the
[10:14:33] residential area most of them came from
[10:14:36] neighboring star systems I heard that
[10:14:38] places like dream flux Reef are
[10:14:40] scattered throughout the memory zone of
[10:14:42] asdon like islands in the ocean they
[10:14:45] existed before the family arrived I also
[10:14:49] Al heard that when dreamlux Reef took
[10:14:50] shape it was the center of all
[10:14:52] Dreamscapes in pentacon okay if that's
[10:14:55] true it's no wonder there are so many
[10:14:58] similarities between this place and this
[10:15:00] heo must be gathering information let's
[10:15:03] hurry up and get going
[10:15:07] okay who wait who's cloa

[10:16:16] but we would have met under more dude

[10:16:29] gravekeeper of dream FL also without any
[10:16:31] spoiler shot does the quest get like
[10:16:32] better and better or how does it work
[10:16:33] does it like scale up or does it fall
[10:16:35] off late game gravekeeper Life in
[10:16:38] dreamlux reef is pretty liberating I
[10:16:40] feel like everyone here mostly keeps to
[10:16:42] themselves without meddling in others
[10:16:45] Affairs my daily task involves cleaning
[10:16:48] a few o quests in most games are like so
[10:16:50] there's usually like NPC filler but it's
[10:16:53] not really filler it's like setting the
[10:16:54] stage right then something really POG
[10:16:57] you POG right it goes up I I'll do a
[10:16:58] graph too it pogs then it goes back down
[10:17:00] to like some like a bit cooler filler
[10:17:02] than the first one cuz there's like cool
[10:17:04] characters but it's like filler and then
[10:17:05] it goes down a little and then and then
[10:17:07] there's like some big cool climax climax
[10:17:10] like like for example it's like this and
[10:17:12] then like it goes up and then it goes
[10:17:13] down a little and then it goes up and
[10:17:15] then it
[10:17:16] like it's not a filler it's like setting
[10:17:18] the stage it's like you need to know the
[10:17:20] information but it's like npc1 oh 20
[10:17:23] years ago the Memoria came all over us
[10:17:27] ah yes the Memoria sorry you're too
[10:17:30] modest Micah when lost Dreamchasers

[10:19:31] not hash ad anymore it's not often that
[10:19:33] I tried this music style I've gained
[10:19:36] some valuable insights from
[10:19:38] it oh I can't thank you enough Robin
[10:19:42] well these kids have made incredible
[10:19:44] progress in only a few
[10:19:47] days it was nothing and Grace I merely
[10:19:50] taught them how to sing it was you who
[10:19:53] brought hope into their lives life must
[10:19:55] be quite difficult for them in reality I
[10:19:58] imagine that's right whenever it's time
[10:20:00] to say goodbye to these kids they're
[10:20:02] reluctant to
[10:20:04] leave but I've explored every corner of
[10:20:07] dream flux Reef talk to do we have a
[10:20:09] robin emote chat are there any good
[10:20:13] ones this shattered dream is not worth
[10:20:17] clinging to
[10:20:20] it seems you truly are a child of the
[10:20:23] harmony Emma and Andy are orphans I took
[10:20:26] under my wing Carol there with her blind
[10:20:29] eyes used to work at a nutrition center
[10:20:32] in the outer ring of
[10:20:33] penacon and as for Gary he's been living
[10:20:37] with autism since he was a child autism
[10:20:40] they're not old enough to enter the
[10:20:41] sweet dream managed by the family
[10:20:45] as see if we compare people people to
[10:20:49] birds these kids are like fledglings
[10:20:52] with impaired wings but in this dream
[10:20:55] well they can fly freely even if they
[10:20:58] stumble along the way well they're still
[10:21:00] relying on their own strength that's
[10:21:03] pretty cool me an old lady with no legs
[10:21:07] well without this dream I couldn't even
[10:21:09] walk toward them what the [ __ ] is futa
[10:21:12] fob fut oh F
[10:21:16] okay never mind I'm glad that you found
[10:21:19] a new life here in pen of course most
[10:21:21] normal fob
[10:21:23] chat don't worry Robin dreams have their
[10:21:27] significance but they aren't
[10:21:29] everything both the children and I
[10:21:32] understand this no matter how long we
[10:21:35] fly through this dream we will one day
[10:21:38] return to reality but you know what Emma
[10:21:42] and Gary aren't plagued by their
[10:21:43] insecurities anymore no and Carol is
[10:21:47] learning how to cope with with her
[10:21:48] blindness and Andy is livelier than ever
[10:21:53] even I've become more optimistic you see
[10:21:56] in dreams we learn how to live once we
[10:21:59] return to reality we learn how to
[10:22:02] survive cool and should our feathers be
[10:22:05] damaged then we share our wings with one
[10:22:07] another there's no need to covet an
[10:22:09] elcer sky in dreams because we have the
[10:22:12] right and the ability to fly towards a
[10:22:15] broader Horizon
[10:22:18] it's a relief to see you safe and sound
[10:22:21] miss
[10:22:22] Robin it's nice to see you all again
[10:22:25] astral Express crew I heard my
[10:22:28] disappearance cause quite the commotion
[10:22:30] out there I'm really sorry about that
[10:22:34] since you're here can we assume that
[10:22:37] you're fully aware of the situation in
[10:22:40] pentacon ever since I returned to
[10:22:43] penacon my voice started to change until
[10:22:47] it gradually faded away
[10:22:50] at first I thought it was a temporary
[10:22:53] ailment perhaps due to having been way
[10:22:55] too long okay no I thought maybe it just
[10:22:58] take some time for my body to acclimate
[10:23:01] to the high concentration of memori and
[10:23:02] Asana no spoilers but also she said
[10:23:05] momor I have to take a shot no spoilers
[10:23:07] but every time I play her in my team she
[10:23:08] starts singing so clearly her voice came
[10:23:10] back so at least I know that's happening
[10:23:12] it
[10:23:13] seems the root of the problem goes Way
[10:23:16] Beyond me there elements around me that
[10:23:19] don't align with the harmony I'm losing
[10:23:22] my voice it's just one of if I finish
[10:23:24] this water bottle from the Memoria I'll
[10:23:26] get a I'll get I'll get I'll get another
[10:23:30] drink the sweet dreams collapse that
[10:23:33] memo keeper mentioned the same thing so
[10:23:37] it's real while I was away from penacon
[10:23:40] the boundaries of the 12 Dreamscapes
[10:23:42] kept expanding
[10:23:44] outward but whenever I mention the
[10:23:46] anomalies in my dreams all the family
[10:23:49] heads refused to talk about it only my
[10:23:52] brother was willing to
[10:23:55] respond okay later I discovered the
[10:23:58] secret letters from the IPC
[10:24:00] Ambassador internal piss commission
[10:24:02] there are hidden secrets beneath the
[10:24:04] surface of
[10:24:05] pentacon so following the clues in the
[10:24:08] oak family's
[10:24:10] dossier I found my way here the land of
[10:24:13] the
[10:24:14] Exiles concealed by the family under the
[10:24:17] guise of death
[10:24:19] a Dream Within a dream where penton's
[10:24:21] past is buried hearing you speak it
[10:24:24] sounds as if your voice is made somewhat
[10:24:26] of a recovery true I hate to admit it
[10:24:30] but the Harmony in this place resonates
[10:24:32] more broadly than within the Sweet Dream
[10:24:34] It's
[10:24:35] regrettable but the family has
[10:24:38] experienced
[10:24:39] betrayal the traitor or
[10:24:42] traitors abandon their original
[10:24:45] principles and using the name of Harmony
[10:24:48] exploited people's weaknesses to turn
[10:24:51] pentacon into the planet of festivities
[10:24:53] okay trapping everyone in the illusion
[10:24:55] of the sweet dream this is not the
[10:24:58] strong defending the weak but rather the
[10:25:01] strong exploiting the weak okay tell
[10:25:03] them a world without equality won't ever
[10:25:06] be favored by the
[10:25:08] Harmony and naturally those voices
[10:25:11] blessed by them could there be another
[10:25:13] Force influencing the family's shift in
[10:25:15] philosophy miss Robin considering what
[10:25:17] happened with acaron it's difficult to
[10:25:20] conceive of another entity within the
[10:25:22] realm of the harmony capable of
[10:25:24] influencing
[10:25:26] everyone unless a power surpassing that
[10:25:30] of an emanator is
[10:25:32] involved I'd heard about what happened
[10:25:34] to the sieno
[10:25:36] alliance but as far as I'm aware the
[10:25:39] family hasn't faced any such external
[10:25:43] interventions okay perhaps I've just
[10:25:45] been way too long been way too long and
[10:25:47] missed something
[10:25:49] regardless I cannot accept my home is
[10:25:51] moving towards the very opposite of what
[10:25:53] the harmony represents then [ __ ] the
[10:25:55] harmony I'm still claiming to uphold I'm
[10:25:56] Malian now must uncover the reason why M
[10:25:59] cut ties with the family M and who
[10:26:02] exactly it was who betrayed us
[10:26:04] all do you remember our Arrangement Mr
[10:26:07] Micah well here's my
[10:26:11] answer I've decided to forgo my role and
[10:26:14] never step foot on the Charmy Festival
[10:26:16] stage again
[10:26:22] 11 of the TR Festival look here brother
[10:26:26] a little bird it's a robin looks like a
[10:26:30] fledgling charm Dove but Charmy doves
[10:26:33] don't live here so how did this little
[10:26:37] bird get here maybe its parents
[10:26:40] abandoned it it looks weak and
[10:26:43] fril why don't we find something soft
[10:26:46] and make a nest for it
[10:26:49] this place is too dangerous for a
[10:26:51] fledgling let's take it with us we can
[10:26:54] put it on the wooden shelf in front of
[10:26:56] your
[10:26:58] window okay a bird like that must have a
[10:27:01] beautiful singing
[10:27:04] voice but where will it live I'll ask
[10:27:08] the family head to build a cage for it a
[10:27:12] cage but then it won't have the freedom
[10:27:14] to
[10:27:15] fly right
[10:27:18] let's
[10:27:19] see what is it that has captured the
[10:27:22] attention of the two best interpreters
[10:27:26] of the great one who kind voice to the
[10:27:29] point that they've forgotten how to
[10:27:31] enjoy their
[10:27:33] dessert oh poor little thing uhoh
[10:27:38] doesn't look like it's doing
[10:27:40] well do you want to rescue it I do but I
[10:27:45] don't want to lock it up in a cage what
[10:27:48] why uh-oh I don't like this guy even if
[10:27:51] it's small and not fully feathered and
[10:27:53] can't sing it didn't come into this
[10:27:55] world just to be locked up in a cage
[10:27:59] Birds they should be flying free in the
[10:28:02] so hi oh
[10:28:05] sorry that's quite the Romantic idea and
[10:28:10] what about you a young scholar do you
[10:28:13] agree with your sister I think she's
[10:28:16] right I feel like he's going to kill the
[10:28:18] if you leave it out in the wild it won't
[10:28:20] survive for more than a few days at best
[10:28:24] ah I see it seems our little scholar is
[10:28:28] still a bit
[10:28:29] unsure well let me tell you youngsters a
[10:28:34] story as you probably know Charmy doves
[10:28:38] can fly through the air when they fly
[10:28:42] really high the friction caused by the
[10:28:45] flapping of their feathers against the
[10:28:48] atmosphere creates amazing lights so
[10:28:51] that they look like shooting stars we've
[10:28:55] seen the spectacle so many times that we
[10:28:58] think it's just something they can
[10:29:00] naturally do but that's not the truth
[10:29:04] their radiant display is the result of
[10:29:08] countless struggles against this doesn't
[10:29:11] sound like a kind voice
[10:29:13] Generations countless struggles against
[10:29:15] nature over Generations ancestors were
[10:29:18] too weak to survive on the ground so to
[10:29:21] escape Predators they started seeking
[10:29:25] new opportunities in the air after
[10:29:28] countless attempts by many
[10:29:31] generations one of them finally figured
[10:29:34] out how to
[10:29:36] fly it soared into the sky and never
[10:29:40] looked back at the ground again so you
[10:29:44] mean birds aren't Born to Fly Like This
[10:29:48] like a metaphor for Robin or some [ __ ]
[10:29:49] find a way to do it through their
[10:29:51] determination well that's an idealistic
[10:29:54] way of putting it so what are your
[10:29:58] thoughts
[10:29:59] Sunday I I think people believe birds
[10:30:03] are meant to fly
[10:30:05] because they've never seen those birds
[10:30:07] crashing to their death D chill that's
[10:30:10] an interesting
[10:30:12] perspective so have you decided what to
[10:30:16] do with the bird now for now I'll keep
[10:30:20] it in a cage until it can take care of
[10:30:22] itself because I I want it to live no
[10:30:27] matter what well is kids it seems each
[10:30:32] of you has found your own answer we will
[10:30:36] take good care of it won't we brother
[10:30:40] yeah but goer wood wood there's one
[10:30:44] thing I don't is that his
[10:30:46] name and what what my who had hoo HQ
[10:30:49] [ __ ] wrote up go for
[10:30:52] wood what if this little Charmy Dove
[10:30:55] never learns to fly in the end I mean if
[10:30:59] there are fledglings in this world that
[10:31:01] can never fly throughout their
[10:31:04] lives should we let them go back to the
[10:31:07] sky only to see them crash to the ground
[10:31:10] and
[10:31:12] die talking in your sleep
[10:31:15] birdie time to wake up
[10:31:19] huh oh he's not dead huh need a hand
[10:31:25] FG I'm still alive yeah happy about that
[10:31:31] where is Robin tell me

[10:31:43] and sound
[10:31:44] she's probably walking around the
[10:31:46] streets now if I were you I'd be more
[10:31:50] worried about
[10:31:51] myself after all right in front of you

[10:31:56] chest for the
[10:31:57] dagger if you wanted to kill me you

[10:32:20] choice you are aware of my plan and see

[10:32:41] a Traer and a bright future for pentacon

[10:33:23] many people who you owe an
[10:33:27] explanation that'd be great please
[10:33:30] follow me honorable Oak family head now
[10:33:34] all the actors are on the
[10:33:39] stage moments
[10:33:41] later this is the monument I mentioned
[10:33:44] earlier the names inscribed on it should
[10:33:47] be familiar to all of you roselina
[10:33:50] and Tian of course when penacon was
[10:33:53] known as a frontier prison it was the
[10:33:55] Trailblazers who connected it with the
[10:33:58] Stars they were the heroes who saved us
[10:34:00] Donna and their names deserve to be
[10:34:03] immortalized not just on the small Stone
[10:34:05] tablet but in the annals of history for
[10:34:08] all of time however today the planet of
[10:34:11] festivities is nothing but sweet
[10:34:14] dreams that heavy piece of history is
[10:34:16] all a distant
[10:34:18] memory just like that prison if their
[10:34:21] names are inscribed here then that means
[10:34:25] according to Micah they died long
[10:34:29] ago Rosalina was killed during the war
[10:34:32] of
[10:34:33] independence she ventured alone Into the
[10:34:35] Heart of the star system to investigate
[10:34:37] the flow of Memoria but she never
[10:34:42] returned tyin was a skilled Gunslinger
[10:34:45] strong and reliable he led the people
[10:34:48] through countless battles but he didn't
[10:34:51] live long enough to witness the arrival
[10:34:53] of true peace true piss in the decade
[10:34:56] following the war pentagone faced
[10:34:58] challenges internal and external to
[10:35:02] protect Asana tyan took up the way of
[10:35:04] the trail place and led the lmth family
[10:35:07] to explore beyond the system only to be
[10:35:11] surrounded and wiped out by the
[10:35:14] Swarm okay though I had expected as much
[10:35:17] the Tales of these Heroes truly are
[10:35:20] sorrowful true to the title of
[10:35:22] Trailblazer they spent their lives
[10:35:24] venturing into the
[10:35:26] unknown but what about this tablet there
[10:35:30] are no names carved on it when dreamlux
[10:35:32] Reef was created its owner was still
[10:35:36] alive however he insisted on erecting a
[10:35:40] monument for himself saying that it will
[10:35:43] happen someday here we meet again Robin
[10:35:47] oh sh
[10:35:48] I clicked too fast here we meet again
[10:35:51] Robin
[10:35:53] sorry items obain speed
[10:35:56] hams I promised to give the siblings
[10:35:59] some privacy so let's talk about our
[10:36:01] business first what do he say that
[10:36:04] sounds sensible enough since you went
[10:36:07] through the trouble of gathering the
[10:36:09] family head the crew and the stellon
[10:36:11] hunters I'm guessing you have something
[10:36:14] important to say Mr Gallagher oh is it
[10:36:16] that obvious the look on your face is
[10:36:19] practically screaming I'm the one behind
[10:36:22] all this yeah tell them
[10:36:24] March you're right Mr Yang it is indeed
[10:36:28] time to come clean on everything the
[10:36:31] siblings already know what they need to
[10:36:34] and they've made their
[10:36:36] choice but you nameless arrived a bit
[10:36:40] late so it's only fair that I answer
[10:36:43] your questions before we begin let me
[10:36:46] reintroduce my
[10:36:48] myself I'm the founder of dream flux
[10:36:51] Reef the deputy of the watchmaker and
[10:36:55] the one who sent out that invitation as
[10:36:58] Gallagher the history
[10:37:00] fictionist I humbly extend my greetings
[10:37:03] to you all history
[10:37:06] fictionist so what everything you told
[10:37:09] us was made up well don't worry fic
[10:37:12] almost everything I shared was true well
[10:37:16] except for the part about the family
[10:37:18] accepting me back I double checked with
[10:37:20] my guy so he's a yapper and everything
[10:37:22] he said about the family the watchmaker
[10:37:24] and M is
[10:37:26] true thank you for your understand he a
[10:37:28] FS crafter now let's get down to
[10:37:30] business I'm sure you're all wondering
[10:37:32] why I went through the trouble of
[10:37:34] setting up this battle for the Legacy
[10:37:36] inviting different factions and stirring
[10:37:38] up a Ruckus all over
[10:37:40] pentacon yeah t orb is better than
[10:37:42] damage boils down to something very
[10:37:44] familiar all of you the stellon the
[10:37:49] stellon but how is that possible penacon
[10:37:52] is a free flowing Interstellar Hub there
[10:37:54] are no signs of contamination whatsoever
[10:37:58] you're totally correct so care to take a
[10:38:02] guess at what that means you're pulling
[10:38:05] on our leg again the sweet dream doesn't
[10:38:07] come out of thin air if you think of the
[10:38:09] memory Zone as the sea creating the land
[10:38:12] of the dreams is like filling that wild
[10:38:15] ocean with Earth to make an island oh is
[10:38:18] Gallagher the one telling everyone to go
[10:38:20] 44111 no wonder have to deal with these
[10:38:22] [ __ ] in my chat stop listening
[10:38:24] to Gallagher to achieve this without the
[10:38:28] help of an emanator of remembrance or
[10:38:30] enigmata the only way is to use a
[10:38:33] stellon and that's not something you can
[10:38:36] achieve with a simple wish it requires
[10:38:39] vast quantities of knowledge time and
[10:38:43] Manpower I'm sure you get what I'm
[10:38:45] hinting at in as Donna the planet of
[10:38:49] festivities itself is a stellon
[10:38:52] disaster uh the planet of festivities
[10:38:56] itself is a stellon disaster what does
[10:38:59] that mean sorry being a z means you need
[10:39:01] to know the inside jokes of like five
[10:39:03] different games I'm sorry liberated the
[10:39:05] frontier prison you don't have to worry
[10:39:07] about it countless challenges as they
[10:39:09] began building pentacon from the ground
[10:39:11] up that's when the idea of using the
[10:39:13] stellon came into play okay the stellon
[10:39:17] first entered the Azon system during the
[10:39:20] war the nameless warned everyone against
[10:39:24] the Folly of attempting to tamper with
[10:39:26] such a power and most heeded their words
[10:39:30] but there are always people in the
[10:39:32] shadows with Al terior motives the
[10:39:35] Turning Point came after tian's death
[10:39:37] with two of the nameless gone the
[10:39:39] watchmaker had to go to the front lines
[10:39:42] it was at that moment his Rivals saw an
[10:39:45] opportunity by the time time a
[10:39:47] representative from the mour systems
[10:39:49] family arrived the watchmaker's call the
[10:39:52] stellon had already been activated and
[10:39:55] was seeping into the primordial
[10:39:57] synesthesia Dreamscape and I suppose the
[10:40:00] family happened to possess the knowledge
[10:40:02] to seal the stellon not just that they
[10:40:05] knew far more about the stellon than the
[10:40:08] average person they helped Mel swiftly
[10:40:11] quell the civil unrest and played a part
[10:40:14] in building pentacon the disguise of
[10:40:17] Harmony those three eras were known as
[10:40:20] the age of dreaming watchmaker who had
[10:40:23] been left in the dark so there's leakers
[10:40:26] Among Us the
[10:40:28] univers then how did they turn against
[10:40:32] each other remember the island in the
[10:40:34] ocean metaphor I don't the truth is the
[10:40:37] stellon was never truly sealed it
[10:40:40] existed in a different form within the
[10:40:43] Dreamscape think about this what would
[10:40:45] it cost to create and maintain such a
[10:40:48] lavish
[10:40:49] Dreamland it's people's lives the
[10:40:52] opulent dream is built upon the decay of
[10:40:55] spirits with a toxic Elixir called
[10:40:58] pleasure flowing through the Dreamscape
[10:41:00] it tempts people to indulge in the
[10:41:03] Dreamscape and gradually their minds
[10:41:05] succumb becoming nourishment for the
[10:41:08] sweet dream oh confusion laziness and
[10:41:12] cowardice weaknesses that plague
[10:41:14] Humanity were magnified and nourished by
[10:41:17] the the family panone became a new kind
[10:41:20] of prison even more impenetrable than
[10:41:22] the previous one I feel like we kind of
[10:41:24] knew this as soon as we saw like 2.0
[10:41:26] preview stream I was like no way this
[10:41:28] happy ass place is actually happy and
[10:41:30] clock's a [ __ ] murderer I'm just
[10:41:31] waiting for that part to be true [ __ ]
[10:41:33] you Clocky sorry sadly we realized this
[10:41:36] far too late by then the family had a
[10:41:39] firm grip on pentacon swiftly quelling
[10:41:42] any opposition that arose at my Wit's
[10:41:45] End I had to use end power of the
[10:41:47] enigmata and sought refuge in this
[10:41:50] chaotic realm over the years I created a
[10:41:53] meme within this dream but you created a
[10:41:55] meme dorcy that's its real name we
[10:41:59] exploited a loophole you see regular
[10:42:01] people can't fall asleep again while
[10:42:03] they are inside the dreamcap so this is
[10:42:07] the true meaning of the
[10:42:09] impossible you sent out invitations in
[10:42:11] the watchmaker's name to find forces
[10:42:14] capable of resolving the stellon
[10:42:16] disaster
[10:42:18] and draw them into pentacon to uncover
[10:42:21] the truth why did someone at Z the thing
[10:42:23] that killed Firefly like I don't know
[10:42:25] what a meme is [ __ ] I know what
[10:42:27] the meme is sorry it's not just that
[10:42:29] above all I wanted to see what happens
[10:42:32] when the major factions engage in a
[10:42:34] struggle for the Legacy since this is
[10:42:37] the watchmaker's first announcement in
[10:42:38] decades the tra tra within the family is
[10:42:41] bound to reveal themselves so would you
[10:42:44] say there's an impostor Among Us so
[10:42:47] Legacy is just a
[10:42:49] facade if you want to consider the
[10:42:51] stellon as the Legacy I'm totally fine
[10:42:54] with that if that's the case where is
[10:42:57] the stellon now that's a question for Mr
[10:43:00] Wings the stellon is still under the
[10:43:02] family's control and as the head of the
[10:43:04] oak family I'm sure he holds all the
[10:43:08] answers so telling me this guy's full
[10:43:10] legal name is Sunday Oak what a [ __ ]
[10:43:13] name are you done talking so will you
[10:43:17] tell us where the stellon
[10:43:20] is okay
[10:43:22] it is the pentacon Grand Theater
[10:43:26] itself huh as I
[10:43:28] suspected it's the embodiment of the
[10:43:31] family the edifice that first
[10:43:33] materialized within the sweet
[10:43:35] dream that's what turned penacon into
[10:43:38] its current state as for the person who
[10:43:40] employed its power it is in fact Mr
[10:43:44] gopherwood the current dream master go
[10:43:47] for what is the worst name well that was
[10:43:49] easier than I thought did you conduct
[10:43:52] your own investigation already
[10:43:56] correct when I was trying to track down
[10:43:59] the person who murdered my sister apart
[10:44:02] from you gopherwood was my second
[10:44:07] suspect confronting me first turned out
[10:44:10] to be a smart move on your part I didn't
[10:44:12] have other options the dream master has
[10:44:15] been elusive and even the heads of the
[10:44:18] families can hardly get an audience with
[10:44:20] him
[10:44:21] moreover Mr gopher wood has been kind to
[10:44:24] my sister in
[10:44:25] me and I didn't want it all to end like
[10:44:28] this what do you mean by that to be
[10:44:32] honest my brother and I are all he looks
[10:44:34] like a vtuber a lot a lot of characters
[10:44:36] do we grew up as orphans and were
[10:44:40] adopted by the family when they came to
[10:44:42] help Mr goer wood recognized our
[10:44:45] potential and brought us to penac
[10:44:47] but I can't just stand by and watch Mr
[10:44:50] gopherwood become an enemy of the
[10:44:53] harmony I won't use my voice to support
[10:44:55] an evil cause I won't step on that stage
[10:44:58] and sing no matter who the traitor is I
[10:45:01] see a chest or what orders they give me
[10:45:04] I won't let the Charmy Festival become
[10:45:05] an event that destroys Harmony itself
[10:45:08] okay I do see that suay Parise in our
[10:45:10] dreams indeed for the Paradise in our
[10:45:14] dreams as the head of the oak family
[10:45:18] I'm responsible for ensuring penton's
[10:45:20] promising
[10:45:22] future Robin and I will head into the
[10:45:24] sweet dream and confront the dream
[10:45:27] master and if it turns out that the
[10:45:29] family has truly strayed from the
[10:45:32] harmony I'll fight alongside you the
[10:45:35] enemies you were about to face aren't
[10:45:36] like this old dog here who can barely
[10:45:39] even bark since our interests are
[10:45:41] aligned why don't we team
[10:45:45] up we have always been following in the
[10:45:47] footsteps of our nameless predecessors
[10:45:50] yeah there's no reason to stop now yeah
[10:45:53] we nameless won't back down from a
[10:45:55] challenge isn't that right Miss
[10:45:57] Trailblazer ain't nothing to fear no
[10:46:00] more we'd win what Heroes Never Back
[10:46:03] Down peace was never not what going
[10:46:05] against the Dre or KN what the [ __ ] is
[10:46:07] this
[10:46:10] dialogue whatever I rate the quest at
[10:46:13] the end of this this is minus one point
[10:46:15] right here
[10:46:17] come on don't crack jokes at such a
[10:46:19] serious moment rest assured sitting on
[10:46:23] the sidelines isn't in our nature Mr
[10:46:25] Sunday miss Robin I'm willing to
[10:46:28] accompany you on behalf of the astral
[10:46:30] Express having a third party present
[10:46:33] should help with
[10:46:35] negotiations and could make all the
[10:46:37] difference if things get ugly thank you
[10:46:41] Mr Yang thank you all fair the charmony
[10:46:43] festival is about to start and time is
[10:46:46] against us everyone let's gather over
[10:46:50] here we still need to make some
[10:46:53] preparations wait can I get food is
[10:46:55] anything open I have to wait till
[10:46:58] 6 the Public Enemy see what welth has to
[10:47:00] say okay what do you have to say
[10:47:04] wel I may have been quick to step up to
[10:47:07] the plate but confronting the dream
[10:47:09] master could
[10:47:10] beine huh even you're saying that Mr
[10:47:15] Yang help powerful is that dream master
[10:47:19] he's the leader of the families of
[10:47:20] pentacon and he has the entire power of
[10:47:23] the harmony behind him not to mention
[10:47:26] the stellon in his possession we must
[10:47:29] proceed with great caution maybe you can
[10:47:32] just stay behind this time Mr Yang no
[10:47:35] that won't do even if we count Robin as
[10:47:38] an ally something felt off about Mr
[10:47:41] Sunday just now although I can't quite
[10:47:44] put my finger on it SAS have to make
[10:47:47] sure he won't turn against us when
[10:47:48] things start to get dicey you're still
[10:47:51] caring sake the IPC Envoy gave you right
[10:47:55] may I borrow it for a
[10:48:00] moment I may have been quick huh sorry
[10:48:04] maybe huh I knew it what do you need it
[10:48:08] for as I suspected this Chip adventurine
[10:48:11] gave to you is actually a miniature
[10:48:13] transmitter if I'm right he intends to
[10:48:16] use it to Trav your location or contact
[10:48:18] you when needed as it so happens this
[10:48:21] may actually be of some use in the
[10:48:23] current situation
[10:48:25] aventurine is he still alive yeah he's
[10:48:28] fine and what does he have to do with
[10:48:30] our mission to confront the dream master
[10:48:32] but remember what I said or maybe I'll
[10:48:34] bust working with the IPC is a way to
[10:48:37] keep the family in check if negotiations
[10:48:40] go south and the family show their true
[10:48:42] colors by going after the stellon I'll
[10:48:45] use this transm to send a message to the
[10:48:48] IPC the only question mark in all of
[10:48:51] this is aventurine current
[10:48:53] status but the IPC is always listening
[10:48:57] the message be a problem okay well you
[10:49:00] take care too if anything goes wrong
[10:49:04] don't worry about me just spoken like a
[10:49:08] true hero even if the dream master is
[10:49:10] innocent the family's corruption runs
[10:49:14] deep I won't make the same mistake male
[10:49:18] did let's wish him the best of luck can
[10:49:21] you eat something no you have something
[10:49:23] else to tell us Gallagher why would you
[10:49:26] say so before we Departed the conductor
[10:49:29] asked us to inquire about the three
[10:49:31] nameless in pentacon we've already
[10:49:33] collected Intel about ralina and tiin so
[10:49:37] the only one left is L work if I'm not
[10:49:41] mistaken we've already met him somewhere
[10:49:44] haven't we H oh call it's not enough to
[10:49:47] say meat but the answer is pretty
[10:49:50] obvious I've been watching over you ever
[10:49:53] since I received the reply from the
[10:49:55] astral Express and I've seen the great
[10:49:57] effort you all put into linking
[10:49:59] different Realms together across the
[10:50:01] cosmos and now after getting this far
[10:50:05] all in one piece you have truly proven
[10:50:08] yourselves Miss himo were you the one
[10:50:11] who repaired the express and got it
[10:50:13] sailing through the cosmos she did uh I
[10:50:15] remember in my gendle star rail himo
[10:50:17] there was a quiz like a quote like I fix

[10:51:14] told me to find the astral Express and

[10:52:42] garden up ahead the first and last male

[10:52:53] okay kind of don't want to use my
[10:52:55] technique is there anything over here
[10:52:57] fine what a he the cloud
[10:53:02] song water heat the cloud saw oh
[10:53:13] chest another chest
[10:53:22] wait is that a wheelchair wait that's
[10:53:23] the [ __ ] uh Relic set that's the
[10:53:25] break effect
[10:53:30] set Beneath the Sea surface of the
[10:53:32] memory Zone in a garden closest to the
[10:53:35] full moon in the water an elderly man
[10:53:37] rests on a recliner enveloped in utter
[10:53:38] silence the watchmaker meler leg work
[10:53:41] has passed through that endless time of
[10:53:42] the dream where no sound could ever
[10:53:43] awaken him sure enough the watch maker
[10:53:46] is the third nameless even I could guess
[10:53:49] that
[10:53:49] one the Legacy he left behind was a
[10:53:52] dream bubble I believe inside that
[10:53:55] bubble there's something that holds
[10:53:57] meaning only for the nameless after all
[10:54:01] when I checked its contents I found
[10:54:02] nothing
[10:54:04] inside maybe some trailblaze
[10:54:07] runes even more mysterious than me well
[10:54:11] let's have a
[10:54:13] look as the words cease himo nods ever
[10:54:15] so slightly in your direction you take a
[10:54:16] deep breath steady your mind and turn
[10:54:18] your gaze towards the watch maker touch
[10:54:20] the dream
[10:54:22] bubble press your against the dream
[10:54:24] bubble and the thick vicious
[10:54:27] Memoria converges under strain then
[10:54:30] stretches outward from your fingertips
[10:54:31] as if weaving a delicate web it gently
[10:54:33] cradles your palm a chill travels from
[10:54:35] your fingertips carrying with it a
[10:54:36] myriad of vibrant and intertwined
[10:54:38] memories as experience would suggest but
[10:54:40] this time you see nothing at all how
[10:54:41] could this be try to focus and capture
[10:54:44] Memories the dream bubble is clearly
[10:54:46] extraordinary perhaps the approach was
[10:54:47] wrong you think holding your breath and
[10:54:49] closing your eyes with one knee on the
[10:54:50] ground you press your forehead against
[10:54:51] the thin film coated in
[10:54:54] memoral there before you there remains
[10:54:56] an abyss of darkness no Crimson Sun
[10:54:58] descending upon the snowcapped mountains
[10:54:59] no gentle laughter no twinkling stars no
[10:55:01] Echoes of Swords clashing and most of
[10:55:03] all no traces of trailblaze there's
[10:55:05] nothing and nothing is there indubitably
[10:55:07] this is but an empty dream bubble wait
[10:55:10] what's going on
[10:55:12] [Music]
[10:55:13] seriously there's nothing inside this
[10:55:16] dream
[10:55:19] bubble How could a dream bubble be
[10:55:23] empty just as I suspected that old man
[10:55:27] always had this strange belief in the
[10:55:29] nameless and the trailblaze and I never
[10:55:31] understood where he got that confidence
[10:55:33] from Echoes especially since he never
[10:55:36] managed to get in touch with the express
[10:55:38] while he was alive could never figure
[10:55:40] out what was going on in that old man's
[10:55:42] head but this empty dream bubble is so
[10:55:46] typical of him he was always full of
[10:55:49] weird fantasies and incomprehensible
[10:55:54] Romanticism that mischievous old
[10:55:58] man don't think that's the case
[10:56:00] Gallagher there's a bird I'm sure M has
[10:56:03] left us the most precious thing of all
[10:56:06] whatever you say gorgeous don't start
[10:56:08] getting all philosophical on me all
[10:56:09] right just as male believes in the
[10:56:12] nameless of the future we
[10:56:14] unconditionally believe in the nameless
[10:56:16] of the past how could they leave with
[10:56:19] regrets for the future when they were
[10:56:21] ready to dedicate their lives to the
[10:56:23] land they loved there must be something
[10:56:26] contained in this dream bubble it's just
[10:56:29] we haven't figured it out
[10:56:31] yet you also have faith in the watch
[10:56:33] maker don't you Gallagher well I'm a
[10:56:37] follower of the enigmata My Philosophy
[10:56:40] forbids me to have faith in anything
[10:56:43] that's why I understand what faith means
[10:56:47] in the path of
[10:56:50] trailblaze and I also want to know what
[10:56:54] he left
[10:56:56] behind can I borrow your pet I need to
[10:56:59] make a trip back to Golden hour and
[10:57:00] check something at the Dreamscape sales
[10:57:02] store it's for male and for the future

[11:00:07] this you tried to contact him on the
[11:00:09] express earlier but they didn't
[11:00:12] respond something doesn't seem right
[11:00:16] I need to leave for a moment you can
[11:00:19] stay here with the receptionist sure
[11:00:24] thing just don't keep me waiting
[11:00:28] forever Don H seems pretty worried about

[11:00:53] unsettling things sorry sorry possibly
[11:00:56] go
[11:00:57] wrong it better not relax with a big
[11:01:00] event like this there's bound to be lots
[11:01:03] of gossip and rumors don't
[11:01:06] worry oh that's a relief well looks like
[11:01:11] I won't get any fudging clues out of
[11:01:13] these two that was useless
[11:01:17] Cody greetings I'm Cody of the blood
[11:01:20] hound family head of security for the
[11:01:22] hotel hello so uh there's something I
[11:01:26] wanted to ask about I've been hearing
[11:01:29] some unsettling rumors about certain
[11:01:32] incidents that might affect the charmony
[11:01:34] festival do I care about this think
[11:01:36] there's anything to be worried about I
[11:01:39] um what do you
[11:01:41] mean wait you haven't heard yes okay
[11:01:44] sorry I'm not sure where you heard those
[11:01:48] rumors but they're completely baseless I
[11:01:52] can assure you as a representative of
[11:01:54] the blood hound family that everything
[11:01:56] is going smoothly for the charm
[11:01:59] festival at present all of the families
[11:02:01] are focused on making sure the festival
[11:02:03] starts on time even the dream master
[11:02:05] himself has arrived so don't worry your
[11:02:08] trip won't be in vain
[11:02:12] Ah that's a relief she doesn't appear
[11:02:15] here to be acting so it seems that even
[11:02:19] the hotel staff are out of the
[11:02:25] loop back already hasn't she returned
[11:02:28] yet
[11:02:30] nope I'm starting to wonder sending her
[11:02:34] to contact Sunday was a good idea
[11:02:36] neither the staff nor the guest seem to
[11:02:39] know anything about what's happening in
[11:02:40] the dreamscaping I
[11:02:43] agree another unusual thing is that the
[11:02:45] oak family is supposed to be in charge
[11:02:47] of organizing the council and managing
[11:02:50] everything inside and outside the dream
[11:02:53] I walked around the hotel but didn't
[11:02:55] meet a single member of the oak family
[11:02:57] okay so no one can stop us if we just
[11:02:59] [ __ ] shoot everyone sorry like just
[11:03:01] like walk forward you don't have to
[11:03:03] fight just go the head of the Yol family
[11:03:05] is that Sunday guy
[11:03:08] right we should linger here too long
[11:03:11] let's go back to the express for now not
[11:03:14] so fast
[11:03:16] if you ever robbed
[11:03:18] vipc bro what if you run away now
[11:03:22] everyone will be chasing after
[11:03:25] you are you this gu a taxor sit here and
[11:03:28] do nothing I wouldn't say do nothing but
[11:03:33] let's stay put for now even if the
[11:03:36] family has ulterior motives they could
[11:03:39] have anticipated us want to attract
[11:03:40] unwanted attention from certain
[11:03:43] Outsiders so they won't do anything been
[11:03:47] Reckless see the IPC lackes are keeping
[11:03:51] a close eye on this hotel if I were a
[11:03:54] family member I'd find an official
[11:03:56] excuse and keep the surprise factors
[11:03:58] here of course we don't need to walk
[11:04:01] into their trap I gave a backup plan to
[11:04:05] the memo keeper if it turns out we won't
[11:04:08] be allowed to enter the Dreamscape
[11:04:10] she'll order a drink for me in the VIP
[11:04:13] lounge at the hotel in real reality a
[11:04:16] secret signal that's right oh a concrete
[11:04:20] object can indeed help the memo keeper
[11:04:22] establish a connection with
[11:04:24] you but Bo Hill if you have more backup
[11:04:28] plans in the future I hope you'll let me
[11:04:31] know in
[11:04:33] advance I'm sorry but it's one of my
[11:04:36] quirks I have too many unreliable
[11:04:40] friends and if I reveal that I have
[11:04:42] backup plans things can
[11:04:47] AR how do we get into the VIP
[11:04:52] lounge [ __ ] I can't check my builds this
[11:04:56] is where my street smarts come into
[11:05:01] play you look tired I'm not tired I'm

[11:05:20] been waiting here forever without any
[11:05:23] food or water what the fork man is this
[11:05:27] how the family treats its guests is this
[11:05:31] your idea of Street smarts starting an
[11:05:35] altercation it's called standing up for
[11:05:38] your right I apologize for the
[11:05:42] convenience please wait while we try he
[11:05:45] glasses and similar hair but he doesn't
[11:05:47] look like me two premium seats in the
[11:05:49] VIP lounge so you can rest there while

[11:06:37] misunderstanding we don't no way if
[11:06:41] someone had reserved such a beverage I
[11:06:43] would definitely remember it and it
[11:06:45] sells for hundreds of thousands of
[11:06:47] credits per bottle after all that's
[11:06:49] strange okay I'm ordering food I
[11:06:52] actually do want to do the memory of

[11:06:54] first and what should we do now no need

[11:08:41] another half system hour if she doesn't
[11:08:44] show up we need to come up with a new
[11:08:46] plan the situation is
[11:08:48] unclear something must have happened on
[11:08:50] the planet of festivities but the public
[11:08:53] is unaware of it someone in a position
[11:08:56] of power within the family must be
[11:08:58] covering it up it's unusual for the
[11:09:00] followers of the harmony to invite other
[11:09:02] factions let alone the IPC and the
[11:09:05] masked
[11:09:08] fools if what you said about the
[11:09:10] emanator of the nihility is true the
[11:09:13] situation in penacon is is a little
[11:09:17] complicated to say the
[11:09:20] least you here G see you in a month I
[11:09:23] feel like we're almost we're like almost
[11:09:25] done as you know the faction that
[11:09:28] follows the path of the Hunt is some of
[11:09:30] the most dangerous bulks in the cosmos
[11:09:32] to mess with I mean we're about to get
[11:09:36] the boss fight right would impersonate
[11:09:38] the sieno alliance or the Galaxy
[11:09:41] Rangers it's like ask him for a death
[11:09:44] Wish isn't is there a saying among the
[11:09:46] sieno people that the rainbow set lets
[11:09:50] their Lux Arrow do all the beaten
[11:09:53] talking do all the Talking well talking
[11:09:58] you know what I
[11:09:59] mean even though the Galaxy Rangers have
[11:10:02] been out of sight for years we've been
[11:10:05] keeping an eye on this region even the
[11:10:08] dumbest criminals know better than to
[11:10:09] mess with the annihilation gain much
[11:10:12] less the Rangers but that Aur CH just
[11:10:15] wrote I have she doesn't seem like a
[11:10:17] lunatic at all on the contr she's smart
[11:10:20] some wrote we have six to seven hours
[11:10:22] left [ __ ] that's how long you
[11:10:24] said the whole Quest is what are you
[11:10:26] talking about when to strike without
[11:10:28] mercy and do you believe that someone
[11:10:31] like her would have an ulterior motive
[11:10:33] for impersonating a galaxy ranger I'm
[11:10:36] not entirely sure but I do have my
[11:10:40] suspicions maybe she knows a galaxy
[11:10:43] ranger or perhaps she's trying to lure
[11:10:46] us out for some reason anyway what
[11:10:49] worries me more are the anomalies within
[11:10:51] the family they've summoned followers
[11:10:54] from various paths for the festival no
[11:10:57] matter how generous such a gesture is
[11:10:59] this move seems highly unusual unless
[11:11:03] the invitations weren't sent by
[11:11:06] them if that's the case it's even more
[11:11:09] intriguing that the family insists on
[11:11:12] organizing the charmony festival maybe
[11:11:14] it's cheap pay the harmony pulling the
[11:11:17] strings you find it Beyond human
[11:11:19] understanding because it wasn't deranged
[11:11:21] by humans at all people do stupid
[11:11:25] things
[11:11:27] impulses they abandon their principles
[11:11:29] when self-interest is involved they
[11:11:32] believe in things they know they
[11:11:34] shouldn't and fudge they even break
[11:11:37] their own rules but
[11:11:40] eons don't they stick to their
[11:11:43] determined path and never turn back
[11:11:46] you think sheep's will is behind all
[11:11:49] this it may not necessarily be
[11:11:53] sheipe there's definitely some higher
[11:11:55] entity
[11:11:56] involved I know sound
[11:12:00] pessimistic but if human Free Will were
[11:12:03] reliable why would we even need Galaxy
[11:12:08] Rangers it's much simpler when you boil
[11:12:11] it down to the eons and paths like how
[11:12:14] long always follows the path of the hunt
[11:12:17] or or how the express stays true to the
[11:12:19] trailblaze despite ail's disappearance
[11:12:22] but in my opinion ail's fall holds
[11:12:26] significance for the nameless oh so
[11:12:29] you're saying the nameless now have to
[11:12:31] take responsibility for their own
[11:12:33] choices because they're absolutely right
[11:12:36] lead
[11:12:37] exactly I believe the purpose of the
[11:12:39] journey isn't just about following a
[11:12:42] path that's always considered absolutely
[11:12:44] right it's it's more about doing your
[11:12:47] best to choose the right path for
[11:12:49] yourself among countless possibilities
[11:12:51] okay even with limited insight and
[11:12:54] judgment okay I don't know what you've
[11:12:56] been through but I agree that people
[11:12:59] must take responsibility for their
[11:13:01] choices because no one else can do it
[11:13:04] for
[11:13:05] them that's why the Galaxy Rangers need
[11:13:08] to uncover he paid for my drink figure
[11:13:11] out her true
[11:13:13] intentions just in case I have a backup
[11:13:17] plan if the memo keeper doesn't show up
[11:13:19] you sure have a lot of cards up your
[11:13:21] sleeve you have sleeves so I guess he
[11:13:23] does but they're like rolled up going
[11:13:24] back to my old career would by the way
[11:13:27] when you were walking around the hotel
[11:13:30] did you happen to see any important
[11:13:33] looking guests what's your plan it's
[11:13:37] simple we just grabed some hostages and
[11:13:40] use them as bargaining chips for the
[11:13:41] family or maybe we can even take their
[11:13:44] identity
[11:13:45] no need for that we'll return to the
[11:13:48] express now wa are you getting scared

[11:16:42] been exiled by the family thankfully
[11:16:45] this memoe keeper came to my Aid and
[11:16:48] helped me escape their surveillance
[11:16:50] unnoticed to be honest it was more like
[11:16:54] stalking than
[11:16:56] helping and the process was far from
[11:17:00] unnoticed but we did
[11:17:03] Escape I asked her to guide me to a
[11:17:05] place beyond the family's reach and to
[11:17:07] contact a few trustworthy individuals
[11:17:10] namely all of you trustworthy
[11:17:15] the son of a nice lady you think I'm
[11:17:18] dumb or
[11:17:20] something how about this I'll put a few
[11:17:23] B holes in your head and see what

[11:17:34] I'm willing to answer all your questions
[11:17:36] but not right now if my cover hadn't
[11:17:39] been blown we might have had more time
[11:17:41] but at the moment we don't have any
[11:17:43] other options
[11:17:45] no other options Put the gun
[11:17:49] down this is the only way I can ensure
[11:17:52] everyone's
[11:17:53] safety I kindly request an immediate
[11:17:56] warp jump out of the ason star
[11:18:02] system this passenger is
[11:18:07] requesting as far as I can tell she's
[11:18:10] not a threat and seems to be telling the
[11:18:13] truth

[11:18:17] your
[11:18:18] companions Don hung please rest assured
[11:18:21] your nameless companions are safe but
[11:18:24] they need our
[11:18:25] help as for booill you may have guessed
[11:18:30] I've been waiting for
[11:18:31] you Galaxy Rangers are known for their
[11:18:34] elusive nature and limited contact with
[11:18:37] so this was the only way I could reach
[11:18:39] my left arm is getting
[11:18:43] numb only by doing this can I find a
[11:18:46] true how long is this cut scene and
[11:18:48] fulfill a long put your gun down
[11:18:51] man to return his relics to their
[11:18:54] rightful
[11:18:57] owner someone once told me that every
[11:19:00] rainfall is like a gift from the heavens
[11:19:05] a sign of their mercy upon the
[11:19:07] world raindrops are said to be the tears
[11:19:10] of the Gods shed in response to the
[11:19:13] Sorrows of the world
[11:19:15] their constant pouring as a reminder
[11:19:17] that the gods haven't abandoned us yet
[11:19:19] okay
[11:19:22] so how long has this rain going on
[11:19:27] for I used to believe just like
[11:19:32] you that it would eventually
[11:19:36] stop years and decades
[11:19:43] pass and in the
[11:19:46] again such
[11:19:48] hope faded away before the rain did
[11:19:53] looks like the god you mentioned doesn't
[11:19:55] exist after
[11:19:58] all as he spoke the old mind's gaze
[11:20:00] remain fixed on the distance admidst the
[11:20:02] fine drizzle of Black Rain countless
[11:20:03] shadowy hands emerged from the sea
[11:20:04] shrouded in ethereal Mist reaching
[11:20:07] Towards the Sky one by
[11:20:11] one let me share a story St with you
[11:20:16] Mortals who walk the
[11:20:19] paths are like Sailors on a vast
[11:20:23] ocean leaving behind a trail that
[11:20:27] creates countless ripples of
[11:20:32] possibilities these
[11:20:34] ripples last longer than the fleeting
[11:20:37] lifetimes of
[11:20:40] humans and for
[11:20:43] some they presence leaves such a strong
[11:20:48] Mark that it's reflected in the
[11:20:53] waves like those Shadows on the ocean
[11:20:57] sin
[11:20:59] thers the obsessions of the path
[11:21:02] sters they emerge from the depths of I
[11:21:07] ex seeing themselves as masters of their
[11:21:11] own
[11:21:12] destiny Unknowing ly repeated the
[11:21:16] actions of their past lives they emerge
[11:21:21] from the nihility and head toward it
[11:21:25] leading purposeless
[11:21:29] lives
[11:21:30] however these Hollow Phantoms they were
[11:21:34] once my dear
[11:21:38] companions a group of Galaxy
[11:21:42] Rangers are you watching over them
[11:21:45] watching over them
[11:21:47] no I'm guiding them toward
[11:21:52] Transcendence it was a brutal
[11:21:56] War a crusade That Shook the
[11:22:02] universe the universe witnessed the fall
[11:22:05] of zuro the L I remember I was there it
[11:22:08] came at a
[11:22:12] price a price so Hefty that only
[11:22:17] those who were
[11:22:20] there still remember remember the
[11:22:24] unwavering determination of the hunt
[11:22:27] followers persists even in
[11:22:31] death so someone must guide these lost
[11:22:34] souls to their life
[11:22:38] beyond they were heroes in their
[11:22:42] time and they shouldn't be reduced to
[11:22:46] Mere puppets of nihility as for
[11:22:52] me I've suffered too many losses on that
[11:22:56] Battlefield to advance any
[11:23:01] further and that makes me the most
[11:23:05] fitting person to carry out this task
[11:23:09] but you know these sin
[11:23:12] thers they're not who they used to be
[11:23:15] does this seem pointless to you though
[11:23:18] some tasks have to be done even if they
[11:23:21] are
[11:23:23] pointless whoa I can help you for what
[11:23:28] for the meaning of the
[11:23:30] nihility that's what I've been seeking I
[11:23:35] see after all this realm is off limits
[11:23:38] to ordinary Souls right thank you
[11:23:42] stranger before we ways I have one more
[11:23:45] question what is T it is true that
[11:23:49] actions and even their entire lives may
[11:23:52] seem pointless from our perspective but
[11:23:55] if and it's just an
[11:23:58] if if this is what the Departed ones
[11:24:01] expected I wait for the Departed should
[11:24:04] we try to change it a good
[11:24:07] question and a profound one what I do
[11:24:10] know holy yep is that one day
[11:24:14] I too will pass
[11:24:17] away and when I bid farewell to this
[11:24:21] world someone will stand at my grave and
[11:24:26] place a bouquet of flowers on
[11:24:32] it
[11:24:35] what 9 hours when I appeared as a child

[11:29:47] no
[11:29:48] brother
[11:29:50] brother brother are you all right
[11:29:54] I'm
[11:29:56] fine I've been working long hours and I
[11:30:00] just made a trip to dreamlux reef and
[11:30:02] back so I'm a bit out of
[11:30:05] sorts but it'll all be over before we
[11:30:08] know it you've been working non-stop on
[11:30:10] the Charmy Festival Mr Sunday and no one
[11:30:13] could have predicted this incident even
[11:30:15] if the stellon does a grave threat I'm
[11:30:18] trying to get through this though you
[11:30:19] still feel sorry for all the trouble he
[11:30:21] caused
[11:30:22] you no need to worry about troubling
[11:30:25] anyone the Charmy Festival was meant to
[11:30:28] spread joy and Harmony across the
[11:30:31] cosmos but now that we know the truth
[11:30:34] pause I can't pause it's it's online man
[11:30:37] I can't pause the game I can I can I can
[11:30:40] just click this but we're going to get
[11:30:42] through the cut scene first we'll do our
[11:30:44] best to explain everything to the dream
[11:30:45] master even if the negotiation does not
[11:30:48] go
[11:30:49] smoothly I'll refuse to go on
[11:30:52] stage without the chord Master the
[11:30:55] harmonious choir would not arrive and
[11:30:57] the Charmy Festival would be just a
[11:30:59] grand performance and nothing
[11:31:02] more I'm relieved to see your
[11:31:05] determination you know since arriving in
[11:31:08] pentacon we haven't had any contact with
[11:31:11] this dream master himself I'd heard of
[11:31:14] the heads of the five major lineages but
[11:31:16] the dream master is a mystery to me the
[11:31:19] dream master rarely grants an audience
[11:31:22] even for us okay dream master but given
[11:31:25] the urgency of the situation he's agreed
[11:31:28] to meet us in
[11:31:30] person perhaps you'll be the first guest
[11:31:32] to meet the dream master in years Mr y

[11:33:23] pretty good but it's no big deal let me
[11:33:26] unrap this looks much better than the
[11:33:29] moon back home it's just
[11:33:32] [Music]
[11:33:34] magnificent they told me not to sell
[11:33:37] everything I had just to come to
[11:33:40] pentacon how short sight sing everything
[11:33:44] you
[11:33:45] had why would you go to such
[11:33:48] lengths why can't you see life back home
[11:33:54] is
[11:33:55] miserable it's not really living at
[11:33:59] all it's better to be here at pinone no
[11:34:03] pain no worries about tomorrow just
[11:34:06] sweet why is this like six-year-old
[11:34:07] drunk do whatever you want that's what I
[11:34:11] call
[11:34:12] living yeah now this is the
[11:34:16] life is this oh it's a pepp sh my
[11:34:22] bad huh what did you say young lady I
[11:34:26] didn't quite catch
[11:34:30] that oh it's nothing sir you see the
[11:34:34] traffic on Glocks Avenue can be
[11:34:36] dangerous how about I ask a blood hound
[11:34:39] family member to escort you to ID park
[11:34:41] over there imagine being short
[11:34:44] enjoying your sweet dream oh yeah that's
[11:34:48] a great idea wow no wonder you are the
[11:34:53] leader of this sweet dream you're
[11:34:56] totally a
[11:34:58] lifesaver see you around Mr sunde
[11:35:01] and it was nice chatting with
[11:35:07] you what's up sister this is the land of
[11:35:11] the dreams
[11:35:13] why do they live like
[11:35:15] this the man we ran
[11:35:18] into he doesn't seem happy at
[11:35:21] all even though sweet dreams are nice
[11:35:24] they're just
[11:35:25] Illusions but for him they're the only
[11:35:28] way to survive even if it means giving
[11:35:30] up on
[11:35:31] reality that's not really living at
[11:35:35] all I suppose you have a
[11:35:37] point but in my opinion that's how most
[11:35:41] people live their lives why do you say
[11:35:44] that you think that man is not actually
[11:35:47] living but that's not quite
[11:35:50] accurate even without pentacon people
[11:35:53] create their own Illusions called self
[11:35:56] value people believe they have a
[11:35:58] predetermined value to fulfill gaining
[11:36:01] value means gaining power this guy talks
[11:36:04] like a super villain deemed worthless
[11:36:05] are seen as the
[11:36:07] weak however value doesn't come out of
[11:36:11] thin air and there's a limit to it to
[11:36:15] accumulate value people have to take
[11:36:18] from others so the weak get explo he
[11:36:22] talks like [ __ ]
[11:36:23] Bane are you suggesting that this is not
[11:36:27] how things should
[11:36:29] be
[11:36:30] exactly but
[11:36:33] ironically people don't think there's
[11:36:35] anything wrong with it because they
[11:36:37] uphold the elusory notion of self value
[11:36:41] and even the weak believe in it
[11:36:44] the survival of the
[11:36:46] fittest that's where all the tragedies
[11:36:48] in the world come
[11:36:50] from people come to the sweet dream in
[11:36:53] penacon to escape from that reality and
[11:36:56] find Solace no tragedies exist here only
[11:37:01] happiness although in its nent
[11:37:04] form isn't that the same Paradise we
[11:37:07] yearn for in our
[11:37:11] dreams perhaps that man is just an
[11:37:15] exception let's not jump to
[11:37:17] conclusions we should experience the
[11:37:19] Dreamscape
[11:37:21] ourselves just as I did at dreamlux Reef
[11:37:24] yes seeing is
[11:37:27] believing I'll accompany you the dream
[11:37:30] master hasn't shown up yet so we have
[11:37:32] some time for a
[11:37:37] stroll oh
[11:37:39] BG what
[11:37:43] glad to meet you again Robin how are the
[11:37:46] preparations for the charmon festival
[11:37:47] coming along we're all so excited about
[11:37:51] it y I'm so [ __ ] hungry it's going
[11:37:54] smoothly you're too kind Robin it's a
[11:37:57] pleasure to have guests from I can't
[11:37:59] stand being lonely or bored so this
[11:38:01] jubilant Dreamscape is perfect for me
[11:38:04] but if this went on forever would it get
[11:38:07] boring
[11:38:09] too n not at all who would get tired of
[11:38:13] having so much fun every day you get to
[11:38:16] wear fancy clothes uh explore all sorts
[11:38:19] of dream bubbles indulge in delicious
[11:38:22] food without gaining weight and you
[11:38:25] never get old or sick as long as you can
[11:38:28] afford a room this place is the ultimate
[11:38:32] Paradise but you know that only a few
[11:38:35] things can be brought back from the
[11:38:36] Dreamscape to reality
[11:38:39] right that's exactly why I don't plan on
[11:38:42] bringing any back just enjoying the
[11:38:45] dream itself is good enough for me I
[11:38:48] mean I'm not one of those long living
[11:38:51] species I only have around 60 or only in
[11:38:54] this sweet dream can I truly feel like
[11:38:56] I'm in control of my life and fate who
[11:38:59] would want to go back to reality after
[11:39:01] what if pen what if peny is a what if
[11:39:03] penon want that shot Z take incoming M
[11:39:05] to stream what if peny is a metaphor for
[11:39:08] playing honkey star rail as an escape
[11:39:10] from your life and then you go to penan
[11:39:12] you play your gacha game to escape from
[11:39:13] the harsh reality and then the moral of
[11:39:15] the story is to uninstall and that's
[11:39:16] what it's going to be like when we
[11:39:18] finish the last ball I don't
[11:39:19] know I
[11:39:21] see I genuinely wish you all the
[11:39:25] happiness in the
[11:39:29] world and I wish you a fantastic
[11:39:32] performance Robin I'm off to the blue
[11:39:34] hour for the ball see you
[11:39:38] later I'm an escapism expert seems like
[11:39:42] that guest's perspective perspective
[11:39:43] didn't resonate with you that's like my
[11:39:45] technique that's my e she had a valid
[11:39:48] point I could sense her genuine
[11:39:51] happiness it's just
[11:39:53] that what you're trying to say is she
[11:39:57] thinks she's in control of her life but
[11:40:00] in reality she's just escaping from
[11:40:03] reality and seeking solace in this sweet
[11:40:06] dream once she steps out of this
[11:40:09] Sanctuary everything will be
[11:40:12] lost well well she did make mention of
[11:40:15] being able to afford a
[11:40:17] room didn't
[11:40:24] she
[11:40:29] thoughts however the Paradise in our
[11:40:33] dreams it doesn't have to
[11:40:39] end no in the paradise we yearn for
[11:40:44] shouldn't be just a fleeting dream
[11:40:49] either wait would you guys actually be
[11:40:51] mad at me if I put Subway Surfer on the
[11:40:56] side a scene Dreamscape is truly
[11:41:01] breathtaking isn't
[11:41:03] it oh Robin can't believe I'm meeting
[11:41:07] you in person you're right even though
[11:41:11] time stands still in this Dreamscape
[11:41:13] it always feels fresh I find something
[11:41:16] new every
[11:41:18] time a philosophical
[11:41:20] mind I hope I'm not
[11:41:23] intruding oh not at all with little time
[11:41:27] left I yearn for Meaningful
[11:41:30] conversations especially with someone as
[11:41:32] esteemed as you it's my pleasure no need
[11:41:36] to be
[11:41:37] formal yeah I was part of a war and
[11:41:41] while escaping from the was in Mother
[11:41:43] Ship I got exposed to some radioactive
[11:41:47] materials and then all my comrads died
[11:41:51] wait are my game sounds too low my
[11:41:53] hometown wiped out by neutral am iting
[11:41:55] one
[11:41:57] gu I couldn't bear to live of everything
[11:42:00] I knew
[11:42:04] gone how hard
[11:42:09] wrenching I hope the family has been
[11:42:11] able to help you
[11:42:13] just a little bit quiet okay and I'm
[11:42:15] truly grateful for that they' provided
[11:42:18] me with a comfortable room the most
[11:42:20] advanced life supports in the cosmos and
[11:42:24] a stellar team of
[11:42:26] caregivers my physical body is now in
[11:42:29] the dream pool sustained by life
[11:42:31] support the me you see here is whole
[11:42:35] rational and no different from any other
[11:42:37] person a true
[11:42:39] appearance
[11:42:40] oh I hope you never so
[11:42:44] you'll be living
[11:42:46] forever just being able to live at all
[11:42:48] is good enough for
[11:42:50] me whether it's in this I don't think
[11:42:52] this part is bad or anything but I think
[11:42:53] this is like I feel like they're saying
[11:42:54] things like I low key already knew or
[11:42:56] they're just like giving me examples
[11:42:57] like real life people but like my world
[11:43:00] has been torn apart and my life could
[11:43:03] end any like I feel like my knowledge of
[11:43:05] Penton an hour ago and now is the same
[11:43:07] even if this whole place is an illusion
[11:43:10] it's still my Paradise and I'll treasure
[11:43:14] every moment I spend
[11:43:16] here how I envy those Everlasting
[11:43:21] things that old man's
[11:43:24] story it's so
[11:43:27] tragic
[11:43:29] fortunately this sweet dream gives him
[11:43:32] joyful memories to hold on to I mean
[11:43:33] yeah but okay for the rest of his life
[11:43:36] it's more about Sunday Robin's
[11:43:37] ideologies okay but didn't we know that
[11:43:38] like from the bird Sunday was like cage
[11:43:40] it and make sure it doesn't die because
[11:43:42] it's going to eventually like fly into a
[11:43:43] wall and kill itself and then Robin was
[11:43:45] like let it free let the bird fly that
[11:43:46] was 2 hours ago I feel like that was
[11:43:50] basically what we're seeing

[11:49:11] dream it can erase the worries and pain
[11:49:14] of reality or bring to
[11:49:17] happiness remember the old man we met
[11:49:20] earlier without this dream he might have
[11:49:23] completely lost
[11:49:25] himself that might be true
[11:49:29] but even without
[11:49:31] penone he could have chosen another
[11:49:34] path as far as I know the intelligencia
[11:49:38] guild has been promoting their
[11:49:39] Rehabilitation techniques for a long
[11:49:41] time now okay
[11:49:43] that path may have been more ordinary
[11:49:45] and
[11:49:46] challenging but now he's receiving
[11:49:49] Hospice Care in a com State and his fate
[11:49:52] who says your fate is sealed I feel like
[11:49:54] that's a voice line I don't know from
[11:49:56] what game your fate is
[11:49:58] sealed or is it taking it away from them
[11:50:01] well don't forget this not every okay my
[11:50:07] bad the future for Humanity is like the
[11:50:10] sky for birds
[11:50:12] people mistakenly believe that flight is
[11:50:14] inherent to Birds because they've never
[11:50:17] witnessed those birds their death he
[11:50:19] said this two hours
[11:50:21] ago brother like it's the same I just I
[11:50:25] just said it's okay sorry you remember
[11:50:27] how we took in that little charm this is
[11:50:30] this is literally the same is am I am I
[11:50:32] [ __ ] Deja Vu am I am I hallucinating
[11:50:34] is this not the same qu is this not what
[11:50:36] happened to years ago I'm
[11:50:38] sorry yeah oh cuz there's no Pon they
[11:50:41] have to repeat okay fair enough food and
[11:50:44] water cuz in genin the difference is in
[11:50:46] genin I skip Pon so I don't see the
[11:50:48] extra stuff okay I decided to leave
[11:50:51] penone I opened the cage and set it free
[11:50:54] okay this is new this is new well I I
[11:50:58] didn't mention what happened to it in my
[11:51:00] letters because I didn't want to upset
[11:51:02] you okay shortly after you left oh you
[11:51:05] cred to its death right in front of your
[11:51:07] window when I had a bird we would let it
[11:51:09] fly in my room and one time it [ __ ]
[11:51:11] ran into the wall cuz dumb like it was
[11:51:13] fine but it like ran into the
[11:51:16] wall I had surmised as much I knew you
[11:51:20] wouldn't have avoided mentioning the
[11:51:22] bird for no reason despite that
[11:51:26] unfortunate I still believe it was the
[11:51:28] right
[11:51:30] decision Birds aren't meant to spend
[11:51:32] their lives in
[11:51:33] cages they belong in the
[11:51:36] sky even if they can't
[11:51:38] fly but here's the thing if there are
[11:51:42] birds in this world that can never fly
[11:51:45] can we really assert that they belong in
[11:51:47] the
[11:51:51] sky are you implying that the same goes
[11:51:56] for humans too
[11:52:00] uh-oh let's take the astral Express as
[11:52:03] an
[11:52:04] example the name okay trous efforts to
[11:52:07] bridge worlds gaining Fame Across the
[11:52:10] Universe
[11:52:12] however only a few extraordinary
[11:52:15] individuals can endure such a perilous
[11:52:18] Journey that's because the pursuit of
[11:52:21] the trailblaze exceeds the capabilities
[11:52:24] of ordinary
[11:52:26] humans otherwise why would this path be
[11:52:29] filled with broken rails an abandoned
[11:52:32] Express and even a fallen
[11:52:37] Eon that's just sophistry what is let me
[11:52:41] look up sophistry sorry then only the
[11:52:44] powerful would have the right to
[11:52:45] determine the
[11:52:48] future use of fous arguments especially
[11:52:51] with the intentions of deceiving okay
[11:52:56] F
[11:52:57] unfortunately that's exactly what
[11:53:00] happens another name for the future is
[11:53:03] self
[11:53:06] value while this world has its fair
[11:53:08] share of Heroes who inspire people and
[11:53:11] Garner admiration for their heroic Deeds
[11:53:14] the majority of ordinary people will
[11:53:16] never become heroes in their
[11:53:21] lifetime some are born weak and
[11:53:24] vulnerable like this guy talks like Bane
[11:53:26] and Thanos had a baby
[11:53:28] circumstances some fall victim to malice
[11:53:31] and
[11:53:32] cowardice when it comes to survival
[11:53:35] everyone is equal and the weak can only
[11:53:39] watch as their value gets constantly
[11:53:41] diminished by external forces that's why
[11:53:44] we should care for the weak and support
[11:53:47] them as if their suffering were our own
[11:53:50] that's what the ODS of Harmony have
[11:53:51] always taught us so true
[11:53:55] Robin while the harmony holds Noble
[11:53:59] aspirations the strong will always be
[11:54:02] strong and the weak will always be
[11:54:05] weak even in this Carefree
[11:54:08] dream human nature contains greatness
[11:54:12] but it also Harbors inherent weaknesses
[11:54:15] that can't be
[11:54:17] eradicated in the end if people can't
[11:54:20] even secure their own
[11:54:22] Survival they won't care about the
[11:54:24] elusory future of
[11:54:26] equality as long as the law of survival
[11:54:29] of the fittest
[11:54:31] prevails there will always be fledglings
[11:54:34] crashing to their death okay I'm not
[11:54:36] even exaggerating if I say a quote from
[11:54:38] either Sunday or like a dictator you
[11:54:40] won't be able to tell which is like a
[11:54:41] movie villain you won't be able to tell
[11:54:43] which is which like I looked up thanos's
[11:54:45] quotes I know what it's like to lose
[11:54:47] your planet was on the brink of collapse
[11:54:49] I'm the one who stopped that the hardest
[11:54:51] choices require the strongest Wills you
[11:54:53] could not live with your own failure and
[11:54:55] where did that bring
[11:54:56] you okay
[11:54:58] sorry but if people don't live for the
[11:55:01] future I like villains there's nothing
[11:55:04] wrong with that
[11:55:05] survival if even you my brother don't
[11:55:10] believe that the harmony will I mean I
[11:55:12] guess he is kind of a dictator lowy
[11:55:14] maybe can make our dreams come
[11:55:17] true I feel like there's two way this
[11:55:19] goes either we just stuck and fight him
[11:55:20] and we win or he's like super strong and
[11:55:22] Robin's like no stop it Sunday and then
[11:55:24] he's like my sister and then he gives
[11:55:30] up why did your mom hear my
[11:55:38] stream people often forget that when the
[11:55:42] first bird took flight the entire world
[11:55:46] envisioned a future where where every
[11:55:48] bird could fly but little did they know
[11:55:50] that the themselves as a bird would
[11:55:53] crash into a wall no more fledglings
[11:55:56] would ever crash to their
[11:55:59] death are you reading sister what are
[11:56:02] you reading Mr goer what gave me a
[11:56:05] picture book it's about the story of the
[11:56:07] harmonic strings if I could become a
[11:56:10] cord Master harmonic wind
[11:56:13] suon dominicus the harmonious
[11:56:17] choir I want to sing with everyone and
[11:56:20] spad wishes so that all can feel
[11:56:21] happiness and joy I
[11:56:24] see then I would summon the harmonious
[11:56:28] choir too don't you have a wish of your
[11:56:32] own wait isn't that a guy from like uh
[11:56:34] Street Fighter guile wait it is wait his
[11:56:36] theme is fire
[11:56:51] [Music]
[11:56:53] wait what the [ __ ] is guess devoid of gu
[11:56:56] what is gu Sly or cunning intelligence
[11:56:59] innocent and without deception is guess
[11:57:01] okay of course like innocent it's just
[11:57:06] that it includes your wish and everyone
[11:57:10] else's I love long for a true Paradise
[11:57:15] where everyone can find peace then let's
[11:57:18] build the stage there and invite
[11:57:20] everyone to our performance so that both
[11:57:23] our wishes come true through the power
[11:57:25] of the harmonious choir it's a deal then
[11:57:29] yeah it's a
[11:57:30] deal but how can I become a cord Master
[11:57:35] bro I study in French stop saying my
[11:57:37] vocabulary sucks of course it does
[11:57:38] [ __ ] Okay I literally went to
[11:57:41] Primary School Middle School High School
[11:57:43] uh cette and University incl in in
[11:57:47] French so when I have to read books
[11:57:49] they're all fresh maybe you'll have to
[11:57:53] become a star
[11:58:00] first eight what the [ __ ] that was 1
[11:58:03] hour [ __ ] we're [ __ ] last time it was
[11:58:07] nine yes and now it's up to us to forge
[11:58:11] ahead
[11:58:12] H since he's already carried out his
[11:58:15] last wish my final mission is complete
[11:58:19] but pardon me if I sound Kurt it's good
[11:58:22] to have
[11:58:23] determination the path Mel left for you
[11:58:26] is not an easy one to Trad why is
[11:58:30] Gallagher okay so I was looking at blade
[11:58:32] right in the car and he had a suit on
[11:58:33] with his like thing unbuttoned and the
[11:58:35] tie down like this I was like okay he
[11:58:36] probably had the tie up for like a
[11:58:38] meeting and then took it off to drive
[11:58:39] Gallagher why is this tie down with a
[11:58:42] but an open and know like a a
[11:58:46] choker why else would he have chosen to
[11:58:49] sleep in solitude staking everything on
[11:58:52] some nameless in the future how do you
[11:58:55] have the
[11:58:55] numbers and in numbers come
[11:59:00] strength oh God any more encouraging
[11:59:03] words as I see it relying on wels
[11:59:07] negotiations alone is far from enough
[11:59:10] we're almost done don't worry regardless
[11:59:11] of whether the other party will be
[11:59:13] compliant negotiating simply allows us
[11:59:16] them as equals and won't grant us an
[11:59:19] upper hand penone is our rival's home
[11:59:22] turf and we already have very few chips
[11:59:26] left to play with rather than idly sit
[11:59:29] around while the families got us blocked
[11:59:31] off an offensive approach might be a
[11:59:34] wiser course of
[11:59:36] action we're more familiar with the
[11:59:39] stellon properties than most and since
[11:59:42] it's the key to stabilizing the sweet
[11:59:44] dream it's vital to the family's
[11:59:47] interests by attacking their core
[11:59:49] interests they're bound to retaliate
[11:59:52] hastily and as the saying goes haste
[11:59:56] makes waste true that's right as long as
[12:00:00] we pose a threat to the stellon either
[12:00:02] with words or otherwise we have a chance
[12:00:04] of gaining the upper hand but the
[12:00:06] problem is on the eve of the Charmy
[12:00:09] Festival opening how exactly are we
[12:00:11] going to get close to the theater Family
[12:00:14] Security will be airtight and if we
[12:00:16] brute force
[12:00:18] it even if we succeed it's too risky
[12:00:24] H so no one's going to say
[12:00:28] anything then I'll raise my hand I know
[12:00:31] the answer to this question Yeah March
[12:00:33] what's up you have all PE whoa of course
[12:00:35] you do looks like we have one more Ace
[12:00:37] of sleeves time for the master stroke
[12:00:42] the express crew would have been
[12:00:44] disbanded long ago if it weren't for me
[12:00:48] so I heard that before the Charmy
[12:00:50] Festival begins there will be a pageant
[12:00:52] to kick off the festival it's called The
[12:00:55] Soul glad TM festivity audition what
[12:00:58] read out TM something and it's going to
[12:01:00] be held in the moment of spor sand as
[12:01:03] long as we clinch the top spot we'll be
[12:01:05] able to attain the title of festive
[12:01:07] Superstar and be able to personally bask
[12:01:10] in The Graces of Miss
[12:01:12] Robin not that that's important what's
[12:01:15] crucial is that we can enter The Grand
[12:01:17] Theater so how do we go about
[12:01:20] participating in these festivity
[12:01:24] auditions I've already procured special
[12:01:27] invite tickets from Miss Robin's fan
[12:01:30] club to tell you the truth I had been
[12:01:33] preparing to join the auditions all
[12:01:35] along but now it looks like even if I
[12:01:39] scrape through I probably still won't
[12:01:41] have have the chance to shake Miss
[12:01:43] Robin's hand so they're still running
[12:01:45] this thing
[12:01:47] huh it was originally just a publicity
[12:01:50] stunt set up by male to drum up
[12:01:53] attention we'll follow Mar's plan I'm
[12:01:56] afraid I won't have the
[12:01:58] time fictionist that's such a fake job
[12:02:02] already completed my final mission as a
[12:02:04] Fields crafter WEA pentac I Ure a spread

[12:25:48] I mean true that's
[12:25:51] fair your endeavors are worthy of extra
[12:25:54] recognition and I've taken steps to
[12:25:57] ensure that however this reward is not a
[12:26:01] material one what's upie but rather the
[12:26:03] opportunity for an open and honest
[12:26:06] communication between us as previously
[12:26:10] oh [ __ ] I didn't my sister Mr Yang and I
[12:26:13] have met with the dream master we delved
[12:26:17] into the truth about penacon and its
[12:26:19] stellon and have come to a consensus
[12:26:23] both I and the oak family canot acques
[12:26:27] to your
[12:26:29] request
[12:26:30] acques the act of or condition of
[12:26:33] acquiescing or giving tacit Ascent
[12:26:36] agreement or consent by silence or
[12:26:37] without objection oh wait I learned
[12:26:39] about this okay I learned this in French
[12:26:41] I learned this though I learned about
[12:26:42] this though I remember my teacher gave
[12:26:43] me a bonus point cuz he said he said in
[12:26:45] class silence never equates to consent
[12:26:47] and then in an exam there was a example
[12:26:49] of implicit consent where you enter a
[12:26:50] taxi uh and in the taxi it's like you
[12:26:52] implicitly consent to paying the taxi
[12:26:55] fair even though the taxi driver was
[12:26:56] like are you going to pay me for driving
[12:26:58] you there you like implicitly did it you
[12:27:00] implicitly agreed by silence
[12:27:07] anyways just as expected we acknowledge
[12:27:11] the perspective of you
[12:27:13] nameless pentacon did he only learn one
[12:27:16] thing in school but not as
[12:27:19] you the planet of festivities cannot and
[12:27:22] will not revert to a place characterized
[12:27:25] by chaos disorder or
[12:27:30] Anarchy through your journey of
[12:27:32] overcoming obstacles you must have
[12:27:35] glimpsed the essence of that era the
[12:27:38] vulnerable ruthlessly El eliminated
[12:27:41] equality
[12:27:43] non-existent common folk living
[12:27:45] precarious lives eing out a Drey
[12:27:48] existence quick pop quiz what is Sam
[12:27:51] step up your game join hell spin today I
[12:27:53] had a meme and I clicked on a video and
[12:27:55] I got an ad what does Sam stand for Sam
[12:27:58] is abbreviation that stands for
[12:27:59] strategic assault
[12:28:01] Mech
[12:28:03] Bravo ultimately only Heroes like
[12:28:07] yourselves manage to achieve success no
[12:28:10] it doesn't yes it is loser sorry I
[12:28:11] didn't mean to call you a loser it does
[12:28:13] though I remember Firefly told us I
[12:28:14] wrote it down but I would dare ask if
[12:28:17] you did not possess the special status
[12:28:20] of having a stellon and you were but an
[12:28:23] anonymous and frail member among the
[12:28:26] masses which penacon would you prefer
[12:28:29] the one without you bozo give me Robin a
[12:28:31] dystopia for the survival of the fittest
[12:28:34] yes or a sweet dream Paradise for all
[12:28:38] there's nothing wrong with being the
[12:28:39] fittest I don't know why are you asking
[12:28:40] me
[12:28:47] true it's not the point don't let him
[12:28:50] mislead you Mr Sunday even if the
[12:28:54] members of the oak family can't fully
[12:28:56] agree on what to do about the stellon
[12:28:59] now's not exactly the time to be holding
[12:29:01] an extensive discourse about penton's
[12:29:03] past is it the stellon issue concerns
[12:29:06] the life and death of everyone on
[12:29:08] pentacon if if anyone has a better
[12:29:10] suggestion the crew is more than willing
[12:29:12] to listen this way we'll at least know
[12:29:15] what welt and miss Robin are dealing
[12:29:17] with and the reason why they failed to
[12:29:19] make our
[12:29:21] appointment ah
[12:29:23] navigator that is precisely my
[12:29:26] intention with all present let's begin
[12:29:29] by discussing the details of that
[12:29:32] meeting let's talk about our
[12:29:34] tribulations and choices our ideals and
[12:29:38] beliefs and our final course of action
[12:29:41] the only path to
[12:29:44] take something on to
[12:29:47] death a while ago you mean to say oh
[12:29:51] [ __ ] it's O for the longest time there
[12:29:53] have been Scoundrels who would use the
[12:29:57] charity Festival that I have Beed to the
[12:30:01] masses as a tool to realize their
[12:30:05] ambition indeed dream master once the
[12:30:08] Charmy Festival begin
[12:30:10] the stellon powers along with the song
[12:30:14] will be broadcast across the entire
[12:30:16] planet of
[12:30:18] pentacon this is indeed surprising to
[12:30:22] me the Dreamscape is maintained by the
[12:30:25] collective effort of the five
[12:30:28] families if someone were to use the
[12:30:30] charm Festival to recklessly disseminate
[12:30:34] the power of the
[12:30:36] stellon this individual must hold a
[12:30:39] position of great Authority do you have
[12:30:43] any suspects I'd like to ask did you
[12:30:47] really not know of the stellon
[12:30:52] existence I would have never thought
[12:30:55] that this nameless which points the
[12:30:59] spere at me if I have offended the
[12:31:02] astral Express extends its sincere
[12:31:05] apologies but the current circumstances
[12:31:08] are dire and leave no room for
[12:31:11] meticulous inquiry we're doing this out
[12:31:13] of concern for the Dreamscapes safety so
[12:31:18] if you could please alleviate our
[12:31:22] concerns dream master it's just to prove
[12:31:26] that the charm Festival has nothing to
[12:31:28] do with the
[12:31:29] stellon if we're being overly
[12:31:32] cautious I will return to the stage to
[12:31:35] offer tribute and song Just per the
[12:31:38] arrangement h
[12:31:41] Sunday
[12:31:43] robinin I've watched you two grow up
[12:31:46] okay know your dispositions like the
[12:31:49] back of my hand why is there a piss
[12:31:51] Fountain both of you right now can
[12:31:54] surely be loed as their most devout
[12:31:58] Advocates I already know your resolve
[12:32:02] the magnitude of this matter is enormous
[12:32:05] and cannot be taken
[12:32:07] lightly since Mr yang has asked with
[12:32:10] such earnestness I will personally
[12:32:14] respond in kind if there is a
[12:32:17] need ain't that Soul glad that's what
[12:32:21] the the government wants you to believe
[12:32:23] it's
[12:32:25] piss someday might I ask you to beseech
[12:32:29] them to cast their light unto me and
[12:32:33] question me in their stead so that no
[12:32:36] lies may be concealed I will do as you
[12:32:39] Comm
[12:32:42] and thanks for ruining pen for me I mean
[12:32:45] Soul glad is basically beer and cheap
[12:32:47] beer tastes like piss anyways so it's
[12:32:49] basically it's it makes sense that all
[12:32:52] may be utterly
[12:32:54] dispelled I will do as you command May
[12:32:58] thy will be carried out on Earth just as
[12:33:02] it is in the heavens oh triplef faac
[12:33:06] Soul please sear his T and P s with a
[12:33:10] hot iron so that he will not be able to
[12:33:13] fabricate lies and make false vows let
[12:33:17] us
[12:33:17] begin there is nothing else to prepare
[12:33:23] understood again
[12:33:25] question have you devoted your life to
[12:33:28] your God never worshiping other gods
[12:33:33] naturally do you love your God as you do
[12:33:36] yourself always heeding their admon
[12:33:40] punishments naturally have you strayed
[12:33:43] from the path expected by your God
[12:33:46] betraying their name never have you ever
[12:33:50] been inordinate with your asks of your
[12:33:52] God coveting more than the foundation of
[12:33:55] the creation itself never never then a
[12:33:59] final
[12:34:02] question do you swear to fulfill all
[12:34:05] vows past present and future no
[12:34:09] naturally with the E my witness if I do
[12:34:13] not deliver on my words or if I reneg on
[12:34:17] my vows may I be cursed in accordance
[12:34:21] with Divine Law they have seen your
[12:34:25] faith and have endorsed your
[12:34:27] faith with this it can be evidenced just
[12:34:32] a moment oh he said objection what is it
[12:34:35] Mr Yang I have another question I hope
[12:34:38] to have answered to my understanding the
[12:34:41] family's Harmony and prosperity have
[12:34:44] never relied on so-called Divine
[12:34:47] interesting the god you both mentioned
[12:34:51] are they truly
[12:34:56] sheipe Mr Yang should know that those
[12:34:59] belonging to the family toil together as
[12:35:03] if they were kin embracing solidarity
[12:35:07] and unity under their Liv
[12:35:10] all duplicity is this doesn't sound very
[12:35:13] harmonious of you dream master such a
[12:35:16] delicate and complex
[12:35:18] Symphony which other God could perfectly
[12:35:22] harmonize this if not for the great one
[12:35:26] she perfectly
[12:35:29] harmonized therein lies the problem it
[12:35:32] isn't an outsider lurking in the shadows
[12:35:35] who changed the harmony but a dissonance
[12:35:38] that has surreptitiously emerged from
[12:35:40] within this very Symphony itself in the
[12:35:44] distant past there existed an eon with
[12:35:47] one flick of the wrist they crafted the
[12:35:49] laws of the cosmos their followers
[12:35:53] formed the beyond the sky choir
[12:35:55] spreading solemn and Reverend hymns
[12:35:58] throughout the Universe later they fell
[12:36:02] the route traversed by this Eon clashed
[12:36:05] with the harmony ultimately being
[12:36:07] absorbed and fused in to it the chorus
[12:36:11] that once reverberated across worlds
[12:36:14] fell silent and when it echoed a new it
[12:36:17] was transformed into the hymn of harmony
[12:36:21] though and Eon May perish paths with no
[12:36:24] Masters still linger in the all
[12:36:27] forgiving Harmony Echoes of bygone
[12:36:30] dissonance May subtly arise okay Mr Yang
[12:36:35] being overly astute can be a detriment
[12:36:39] especially when you find this guy has a
[12:36:41] black hole in his staff he'll be fine

[12:39:37] in entertaining any type of discussion
[12:39:40] you're mistaken Miss
[12:39:42] himiko they are in very safe hands and
[12:39:46] just as the family has always proclaimed
[12:39:49] no one can be harmed in the Dreamscape
[12:39:52] least of all in the beautiful new world
[12:39:54] belonging to the order penacon and the
[12:39:57] entire universe have witnessed far too
[12:39:59] much innocent
[12:40:01] Bloodshed the strong wield their blades
[12:40:04] against the weak and the victors push
[12:40:07] the vanquished to the brink of life
[12:40:10] natural
[12:40:12] selection the world abides by this
[12:40:14] principle establishing the wellbeing of
[12:40:18] humanity at top the corpses of the
[12:40:22] downtrodden only we or rather I possess
[12:40:28] the power to put an end to this
[12:40:31] farce so you've decided to resurrect a
[12:40:34] dead
[12:40:35] Eon no one's ever done such a thing if
[12:40:39] Miss himiko is interested let's draw
[12:40:42] back the veil and speak candidly I've
[12:40:45] always firmly believed that people can
[12:40:47] understand one another through peaceful
[12:40:49] means I'm willing to divulge the
[12:40:51] unembellished truth as to the intentions
[12:40:54] of the orders path Striders so that you
[12:40:57] will make better judgment for the astral
[12:40:59] Express for pentacon and for this
[12:41:02] stretch of the
[12:41:04] universe words can hardly do justice to
[12:41:07] the beauty of that ideal so
[12:41:09] come with me
[12:41:11] everyone let us retrace our steps and
[12:41:16] huh where he go welcome this isn't any
[12:41:20] location in penton's Dreamscape it's my
[12:41:24] inner World wait we're inside Sunday the
[12:41:26] reason the scenery how do you feel
[12:41:27] abouts unchanged is because your
[12:41:30] Consciousness has drawn on similar
[12:41:32] Concepts to fill in the gaps you
[12:41:35] imprisoned us did you do the same to
[12:41:36] welt it's a tuning process
[12:41:39] stronger in effect and more draining on
[12:41:42] the mind the gray-haired guest has
[12:41:44] experienced it before so she should
[12:41:47] understand what it entails tuning allows
[12:41:50] you to intuitively grasp my feelings
[12:41:53] which also means I cannot hide did they
[12:41:55] predicted weing waves now everyone
[12:41:59] please look at the huge screen the road
[12:42:02] we once took begins
[12:42:05] here from this point on you will witness
[12:42:09] the numerous decisions I've faced I've
[12:42:12] selected a portion okay this part seems
[12:42:13] sick and I'm lowkey distracted cuz I
[12:42:15] need to go to the was room give me a
[12:42:16] second I believe after going through
[12:42:18] similars I'll be fast you'll be able to
[12:42:21] better understand my
[12:42:27] thoughts sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
[12:42:29] sorry dude literally you won't believe
[12:42:31] this you won't [ __ ] believe this as I
[12:42:33] went upstairs so there's a cat stuck in

[12:42:49] you won't [ __ ] believe it the [ __ ]
[12:42:50] skeletons left the closet had to go put
[12:42:52] that [ __ ] back in now we're
[12:42:56] here let's begin the first decision a
[12:43:01] story about a baby
[12:43:04] bird this story happened when Robin and
[12:43:07] I were very young okay we were victims
[12:43:10] of the stellon disaster and the family's
[12:43:13] Mr gopher wood who would later become
[12:43:16] the dream master of
[12:43:18] pentacon saw that we siblings had no one
[12:43:21] to turn to and took us in why is this
[12:43:23] guy called go for wood is there Robin
[12:43:26] and I lived the time with naria care in
[12:43:28] the world one day after dinner while my
[12:43:32] younger sister and I were lounging about
[12:43:34] same dude if Sunday was a streamer you
[12:43:36] guys would be typing same one story
[12:43:39] charmony Dove all on its
[12:43:42] own that baby bird was Tiny it didn't
[12:43:46] even have all of its feathers and it
[12:43:48] couldn't
[12:43:49] sing when we found it it was already on
[12:43:53] its last breath really I've never heard
[12:43:55] of this before into a
[12:43:56] shrub probably abandoned by its parents
[12:44:00] wait there was a bird we decided to
[12:44:02] build a nest for it right there and
[12:44:04] then however thinking back that winter
[12:44:09] was unusually cold with Fierce winds at
[12:44:12] night in the yard not to mention the
[12:44:15] many poisonous bugs and wild oh a Bible
[12:44:17] reference gopher wood gopherwood is a
[12:44:20] term used once in the Bible for the
[12:44:22] material used to construct Noah's
[12:44:24] Ark she's Skeleton on my closet till I
[12:44:27] Google doc what okay noted it was clear
[12:44:32] that if we left the fledgling in the
[12:44:34] yard it stood no chance of surviving
[12:44:37] until spring
[12:44:39] so I suggested we take it inside place
[12:44:43] it on the shelf by the window and asked
[12:44:45] the adults to Fashion a cage for it we
[12:44:48] decided that when it regained its
[12:44:50] strength enough to spread its wings we
[12:44:53] would release it back into the
[12:44:56] wild the tragic part some yeah yeah the
[12:44:59] bird [ __ ] died we know you already
[12:45:01] told this fate had already been
[12:45:04] determined long before this
[12:45:07] moment it's Destiny
[12:45:09] was determined by our momentary
[12:45:12] whim now I pass the Power of Choice to
[12:45:16] you all faced with this
[12:45:19] situation what choice would you make
[12:45:22] stick to the original plan and build a
[12:45:24] nest with soft net where the charmony
[12:45:27] dove fell or build a cage for it and
[12:45:31] feed it giving it the utmost care from
[12:45:35] within the warmth of a h oh just give it
[12:45:36] a cage I eagerly await your
[12:45:40] answer okay hot okay okay I may be a hot
[12:45:44] take but like if if a lot of wild
[12:45:46] animals just die in the wild is it even
[12:45:47] that bad if they're domesticated and I'm
[12:45:49] like feeding them and like they're my
[12:45:50] homie I feel like they're living a good
[12:45:52] life I don't know unless you like cut
[12:45:53] its balls off but
[12:45:55] like are the cage for it yep I'm happy
[12:45:58] to see that you made a choice similar to
[12:46:01] ours if your mind is made up let me
[12:46:04] reveal the outcome of this choice we
[12:46:08] passionately know Ned it back to health
[12:46:10] preparing only the best food for it
[12:46:12] every day we even pred its
[12:46:15] feathers later on the day that Robin
[12:46:19] left
[12:46:20] penone we opened the cage door and let
[12:46:22] it fly back into the sky I watched it
[12:46:25] for a long while by the window probably
[12:46:28] about three or so days in those I don't
[12:46:32] know why I agreed with Sunday sorry he's
[12:46:34] ging me a [ __ ] psychotic rant I'm
[12:46:37] sorry it succeeded
[12:46:40] but its attempt did not go
[12:46:42] perfectly after flying UNS the fall
[12:46:45] shattered okay I get it the bird died
[12:46:47] regret the choices we
[12:46:50] made next let us head to the second
[12:46:54] decision this time it's the story of a
[12:46:58] Dreamchaser
[12:47:00] okay this story happened when I was
[12:47:03] appointed as [ __ ] new story POG a
[12:47:06] position exclusive to the Oak family
[12:47:09] charged with listening to the problems
[12:47:11] and vexations of escap residence wait
[12:47:14] maybe this is actually I think we saw
[12:47:15] this this is when he was in the chur it
[12:47:18] was during that period that I had the
[12:47:20] opportunity to hear voices from all
[12:47:22] corners of the
[12:47:24] Dreamscape he was a
[12:47:26] Dreamchaser and it's St away it's not
[12:47:31] just like the rest of them yeah we know
[12:47:33] this I was there it was like an hour ago
[12:47:35] all good except that to most people
[12:47:39] the price he
[12:47:41] paid I suppose you could say it was
[12:47:44] everything he told me I sold everything
[12:47:49] heed his two children he had a plan in
[12:47:51] place he would buy back his children
[12:47:53] once he had made his fortune and enjoy
[12:47:56] panac con's beautiful dream with
[12:47:59] them alas his plan to smuggle himself
[12:48:03] with somewhat clumsy and he was sniffed
[12:48:06] out by those pigheaded Hound
[12:48:10] after hearing the Dreamchaser story I
[12:48:12] immediately appealed to the blood hound
[12:48:14] family to cease their
[12:48:16] Pursuit that way at least he could live
[12:48:20] peacefully but I was still too naive to
[12:48:24] the ways of the
[12:48:25] world I did not anticipate that what I
[12:48:28] thought was a kind gesture I finished
[12:48:30] reading this in my head like 20 minut 20
[12:48:32] seconds ago and I'm just waiting for him
[12:48:33] to catch up cuz chat is slow sorry I
[12:48:35] could let you guys read sorry
[12:48:39] I'll tell you the outcome soon for now
[12:48:43] I'd like you all to make a choice will
[12:48:45] you do as I did and try to convince the
[12:48:47] blood hound family to stop their Pursuit
[12:48:51] so that the Dreamchaser may live
[12:48:52] peacefully and realize his wishes or
[12:48:55] will you remain silent leaving him to
[12:48:58] languish while the hounds are hot on his
[12:49:00] heels until his inevitable J I look
[12:49:03] forward to everyone's decisions wait
[12:49:06] can't you just like free the kids let
[12:49:07] them die if you have that much pull
[12:49:09] can't you just like buy the kid like
[12:49:10] like set them like I don't know buy them
[12:49:12] and then buy them food [ __ ] the guy let
[12:49:14] the guy die he sold his kids kill them
[12:49:16] but who takes care of them I mean you're
[12:49:17] Sunday you're rich buy the kids then
[12:49:19] like give them to someone who's adopting
[12:49:21] and then give them food if no one's
[12:49:23] adopting then I don't know [ __ ] get
[12:49:25] them a PC and make them Farm your
[12:49:26] dailies but then you like feed them and
[12:49:28] stuff it's fine just they'll play gacha
[12:49:29] games for you they'll be happy they'll
[12:49:31] play Goa games you'll like feed them
[12:49:33] they'll have to live a free and happy
[12:49:35] life but they play Goa games okay sorry
[12:49:38] feed them to the Swarm give them to
[12:49:40] arlino no I don't know about that
[12:49:50] one it seems you like me are pondering
[12:49:54] whether a different Choice could have
[12:49:56] led to a better outcome say he never
[12:49:58] gets caught he would only die from
[12:50:01] delirium caught the methods with which
[12:50:04] illegal stowaways enter dreams are unor
[12:50:06] should he be apprehended
[12:50:09] could the hounds afford to turn a blind
[12:50:11] eye the answer is a definitive no as to
[12:50:16] your
[12:50:17] choice I once in the story this time oh
[12:50:20] a new story this story happened the day
[12:50:23] I was appointed the oak family head at
[12:50:27] that time Mr gopherwood was the current
[12:50:30] dream master and as for his wish we had
[12:50:34] a private conversation what surprised me
[12:50:37] was that the dream master had only come
[12:50:39] to deliver a letter to me he let me read
[12:50:42] its contents and it was a letter from my
[12:50:48] sister the letter contained the usual
[12:50:51] pleasantries anecdotes from her travels
[12:50:54] nothing out of the
[12:50:55] ordinary just as I started wondering how
[12:50:58] this letter related to our
[12:51:00] discussion the dream master began to
[12:51:03] speak do you know who wrote this letter
[12:51:07] my sister of of course but why would you
[12:51:10] personally visit me to hand me a letter
[12:51:13] from my sister containing mere
[12:51:15] trivialities uhoh to help you grasp the
[12:51:18] false scope of this
[12:51:20] issue do you know where Robin is at this
[12:51:24] moment from what the letter indicates
[12:51:27] Cas
[12:51:28] VI has she mentioned anything about a
[12:51:31] stray bullet a stray bullet a war has
[12:51:35] broken out on that planet it is be
[12:51:38] because of this very reason that Robin
[12:51:41] chose this
[12:51:42] destination to spread the word of the
[12:51:46] Harmony and to save the lives of planets
[12:51:50] she personally made for the front
[12:51:54] lines she hoped to ease the people's
[12:51:57] suffering with s and was willing to
[12:52:00] Brave mortal danger to deliver the ipc's
[12:52:03] medical supplies
[12:52:06] unfortunately stay let show no such
[12:52:12] compassion is she all
[12:52:14] right why did someone just type in my
[12:52:17] chat stelle is not cringe bro I said
[12:52:19] that 2 hours ago are you on Internet
[12:52:22] Explorer on your mobile
[12:52:24] device if the operation was successful
[12:52:28] she should probably be recovering in the
[12:52:31] field
[12:52:33] hospital by the Eon above the bullet
[12:52:37] struck her neck directly yet possibly as
[12:52:40] a reward for her consistent Deeds of
[12:52:43] Harmony it didn't hit any vital
[12:52:46] arteries once you've attended to your
[12:52:49] outstanding tasks it would be advisable
[12:52:52] to write her back as soon as
[12:52:55] possible those damned
[12:52:58] Savages I'll pack my bags right away my
[12:53:02] gratitude for bringing this to my
[12:53:03] attention Mr gopherwood
[12:53:06] now you understand why she always wears
[12:53:09] such elaborate neck ornaments well I
[12:53:11] didn't even notice how could this happen
[12:53:14] wait show me her neck all in the past so
[12:53:16] please don't worry I'm looking this up I
[12:53:18] share this in the HR understand the
[12:53:22] harmonies limitations and predicament
[12:53:25] yeah she has the strong defending the
[12:53:28] weak look up her E6 many times it is
[12:53:32] nothing more than wishful
[12:53:37] thinking there's nothing oh there's a
[12:53:39] hole wait is that my monitor that's
[12:53:40] dirty wait maybe my monitor is dirty oh
[12:53:42] no there is
[12:53:47] a yeah it is
[12:53:51] there
[12:53:53] likewise I've prepared one last question
[12:53:56] one last choice because this is merely a
[12:54:00] figment of
[12:54:01] imagination a nightmare that has haunted
[12:54:05] me through countless nights if you never
[12:54:08] had the opportunity to make a choice
[12:54:10] like I did would you still support
[12:54:13] Robin's Journey on the path of Harmony
[12:54:16] yes [ __ ] you Sunday theci side Robin's
[12:54:21] Destiny I mean I'd support her but I'd
[12:54:23] probably be like hey maybe you shouldn't
[12:54:25] go on the front lines like you're
[12:54:26] probably going to die but like I support
[12:54:28] you like I wouldn't stop her from
[12:54:29] Harmony I'd probably just be like yo
[12:54:31] maybe don't book a flight there ask
[12:54:34] March wait you can talk to them
[12:54:39] I can't believe that happened to miss
[12:54:42] Robin the strong defending the weak is a
[12:54:45] great Mantra but if I had to pay such a
[12:54:49] price
[12:54:57] I I often feel like I've dreamt of
[12:55:01] similar scenes on certain
[12:55:03] nights in the dream I see blurry fa
[12:55:08] es their confusion and fear are Lucid to
[12:55:13] me but I also remember they chose never
[12:55:17] to give
[12:55:19] up if Mr Sunday's question leaves you
[12:55:23] puzzled you should find the answer from
[12:55:25] your own
[12:55:26] experiences with each Trail blaz dangers
[12:55:30] and tribulations will surely
[12:55:32] follow but would you ever back away yeah
[12:55:36] would you stop March I never back
[12:55:38] reaching their next destination I mean I
[12:55:40] would I would tell you to stay in the
[12:55:41] ship youo so you don't die believe you
[12:55:42] have an answer of your own in
[12:55:44] your I said stop making numy run around
[12:55:47] dude he needs exercise look at
[12:55:52] him
[12:55:57] sorry Miss Robin's courage is
[12:56:01] admirable and here I was thinking she
[12:56:04] was just another Superstar celebrity but
[12:56:07] the fact she's also Mr Sunday's younger
[12:56:11] sister no I doubt he'd wish harm on his
[12:56:14] own flesh and
[12:56:16] blood well I'm going to support her but
[12:56:19] um I still don't think she should go
[12:56:21] like I'd be like yo maybe like pursue
[12:56:23] your path of Harmony but like don't go
[12:56:25] to the AC of War Zone maybe maybe just
[12:56:27] make like a heartfelt tweet about
[12:56:29] it welcome to my you know when Co
[12:56:33] started and like all the celebrities
[12:56:35] like sang imagine on like a zoom call
[12:56:37] just do that
[12:56:43] that will he make this Choice
[12:56:47] yeah I
[12:56:51] see I am now aware of everyone's
[12:56:55] stances raising these questions merely
[12:56:58] serves to illustrate one
[12:57:00] point the light of penacon cannot be
[12:57:03] salvaged welcome to my War the true
[12:57:06] foundation for a weak dream if I can
[12:57:09] stop one Z from stalling can only be
[12:57:11] established through the order where the
[12:57:14] strong govern the weak I know the
[12:57:17] suffering of being
[12:57:19] tormented the turmoil of losing your way
[12:57:22] how sorrow and even despair set in when
[12:57:27] matters don't work
[12:57:28] out all of this causes me unending
[12:57:32] pain because this is not what happiness
[12:57:35] is at all
[12:57:38] we must teach the weak how to live a
[12:57:40] happy life and this life isn't some
[12:57:43] Noble propriety that the Upper Crust
[12:57:45] preaches but in definitive terms a way
[12:57:49] of survival that belongs to
[12:57:52] everyone so what is your definition of
[12:57:55] living a happy
[12:57:57] life huh good
[12:58:00] question human consciousness is
[12:58:03] fundamentally an illusion a cage known
[12:58:06] as selfworth
[12:58:08] people lured in by this illusion make
[12:58:11] mistakes yet still ask that external
[12:58:14] influences bear the burden when one
[12:58:18] mistake after the next permeates the
[12:58:20] masses they become impossible to trace
[12:58:24] thus the amassing of these individual
[12:58:27] cages culminate to form a prison a place
[12:58:31] dictated only by the rule of survival of
[12:58:34] the Fist you be like as a child we found
[12:58:37] a bird nature is always accompanied by
[12:58:40] predation and
[12:58:42] sacrifice its antithesis is known as
[12:58:46] order that is what I want to do unite
[12:58:50] people's happiness under the banner of
[12:58:52] order they won't need to make bitter
[12:58:55] choices any longer nor face the
[12:58:58] weaknesses of
[12:58:59] humanity they can cast aside their
[12:59:02] Primal instincts to build a Haven for
[12:59:05] mankind
[12:59:08] simply describing thoughts as far too
[12:59:11] abstract okay so allow me to provide a
[12:59:14] simple example simple example okay as
[12:59:16] you all may know there are societal
[12:59:18] Norms like weekends and long weekends on
[12:59:23] some worlds okay during these hard
[12:59:26] earned rest days people are given the
[12:59:28] chance to extricate themselves from the
[12:59:30] stresses of everyday life yeah allowing
[12:59:34] a certain Tranquility to return to their
[12:59:36] souls Sunday is a weekend
[12:59:38] and it is only on these days that people
[12:59:41] do not have to adhere to the law where
[12:59:43] the strong prey on the
[12:59:45] weak they can live out their lives
[12:59:47] happily during these brief
[12:59:50] intermissions it's just a Pity that two
[12:59:54] or three days are still too fleeting
[12:59:57] compared to the span of a
[13:00:00] lifetime from where I stand society's
[13:00:04] ideal system should be seven rest days
[13:00:07] follow in Sunday there should ensue a
[13:00:10] okay I mean kind of based a third and
[13:00:12] indeed an infinite procession of
[13:00:15] Sundays this should be the face of the
[13:00:17] new world idilic Eternal peaceful days
[13:00:23] uh there's a quote that goes you don't
[13:00:24] hate Mondays you hate capitalism is this
[13:00:26] what Sunday's trying to
[13:00:28] say and thus every person can return to
[13:00:32] their base selves in this can't see text
[13:00:35] hello some gaze in reverence at the the
[13:00:38] Stars pouring their whole beings into
[13:00:40] calculating the distance between us and
[13:00:43] the isolated world of pagana meanwhile
[13:00:47] some seek refuge in quiet Corners
[13:00:49] holding one another unencumbered by the
[13:00:52] chains of unwelcome
[13:00:55] obligations there would be no need to
[13:00:57] Bear the hardships of
[13:00:59] reality only in this way can Humanity
[13:01:03] face the inevitable end with the purest
[13:01:06] of spirit
[13:01:08] living a life of
[13:01:10] dignity this is what it is to live in
[13:01:15] Bliss Miss
[13:01:17] Firefly you who are stricken with
[13:01:19] entropy lost
[13:01:21] syndrome you of all would surely
[13:01:24] understand this herass is not
[13:01:30] listening it sounds like a Flawless
[13:01:36] Theory but that's
[13:01:40] yeah
[13:01:42] but what is the price to attain all
[13:01:47] this the cost is minute merely a
[13:01:50] personal and eternal
[13:01:53] sacrifice if this paradise is to be
[13:01:56] maintained for everyone someone must
[13:01:59] remain trapped in solitary wakening
[13:02:02] until the end of the
[13:02:06] cosmos wakening
[13:02:09] which means that this socalled paradise
[13:02:12] is still a dream stepping into this
[13:02:15] paradise means forsaking reality
[13:02:21] correct it is not forsaking but
[13:02:25] transcending Flesh Blood sorrow this guy
[13:02:28] talk too much if the physical is
[13:02:31] spiritual
[13:02:32] suffering it is only logical that we
[13:02:35] defeat it
[13:02:38] but in this supposed Bliss people won't
[13:02:40] have defeated their
[13:02:42] demons the chance to overcome their
[13:02:44] tribulations would be forever lost to
[13:02:48] them in other
[13:02:50] words it is an
[13:02:52] escape that's like AA game understanding
[13:02:55] it but there is no shame in escape on
[13:02:59] the contrary the seeds of Escape exist
[13:03:02] in everyone's Hearts don't you agree
[13:03:04] Miss
[13:03:05] Firefly and as to why we
[13:03:08] sleep it is because we are afraid to
[13:03:11] awaken from our
[13:03:13] dreams but this is not in conflict with
[13:03:16] the grand
[13:03:17] plan only in acknowledging this can we
[13:03:20] truly understand the Frailty of human
[13:03:23] nature and from there show compassion
[13:03:27] and
[13:03:30] protection
[13:03:33] I I admit that you are a born leader
[13:03:38] your perspective on Humanity brims with
[13:03:43] pessimism yet you express compassion for
[13:03:47] all even when your heart pies them wait
[13:03:50] wait wait wait wait what's
[13:03:54] up okay I'm live one
[13:03:57] [Music]
[13:03:58] sec but unlike
[13:04:01] you I live for the
[13:04:04] self from my perspective in
[13:04:08] choices for themselves is their
[13:04:12] Birthright the want to escape may be
[13:04:15] innate in the
[13:04:16] weak but whether they are weak or
[13:04:20] not it is not up to another to
[13:04:24] decide perhaps in your
[13:04:27] mind you also view me as
[13:04:35] weak because I don't think
[13:04:40] so true as Miss Firefly has said her
[13:04:43] peace the astral Express will also
[13:04:46] naturally give you our
[13:04:50] answer we'll leave it to you just as Mr
[13:04:53] male instructed before tell him our
[13:05:03] choice one second what is this place oh
[13:05:08] [ __ ] Misha does this place ring any
[13:05:11] bells
[13:05:12] Misha I I don't know but I feel a sense
[13:05:17] of deja vu what is this
[13:05:21] place some want to like show you on love
[13:05:32] you D it's the realm within a dream
[13:05:35] bubble this was left to the as Express
[13:05:38] by a nameless but weirdly when we
[13:05:41] entered it it was completely empty the
[13:05:43] cab is tilted wa is
[13:05:46] [Music]
[13:05:48] it is
[13:05:55] it please turn it back off looks fine
[13:05:59] okay Dr Edward from the Dreamscape sales
[13:06:02] store told me that dreams are formed
[13:06:05] from memories and a dream bubble anyway
[13:06:07] hi Misha you going to learn Misha lore I
[13:06:10] saw I I I'm like pretty spoiler free no
[13:06:13] spoilers I just saw that Misha was
[13:06:15] trending on Twitter like a while ago so
[13:06:17] I assume there's there's
[13:06:19] stuff so I thought you might be able to
[13:06:22] help us in unraveling this mystery
[13:06:25] unravel oh
[13:06:28] sh
[13:06:30] us among us too W that's a combo I don't
[13:06:33] know much about dream bubbles but if you
[13:06:37] want to figure out what this Mansion is
[13:06:39] I'll do my best I'm counting on you
[13:06:43] then all right he Mayo I still don't get
[13:06:47] it why were you so sure that Misha had a
[13:06:49] connection with this dream bubble no
[13:06:52] wrong voice I'm sorry I'm sorry I meant
[13:06:53] to do I'll stop I ruined it I wasn't
[13:06:57] sure it was just a hunch but since Misha
[13:07:01] feels familiar with this place my hunch
[13:07:05] might be correct so true this place
[13:07:07] looks a bit familiar I remember this
[13:07:09] place exactly this is where you and
[13:07:12] Firefly encountered death which we now
[13:07:15] know as
[13:07:17] dormancy considering its connection to
[13:07:19] dreamlux Reef it's not surprising it
[13:07:22] appeared here the question now is who
[13:07:25] brought you here based on the clues we
[13:07:28] have so far it's unlikely to be that
[13:07:30] masked fool we're drawing closer to the
[13:07:33] truth once more let's give Misha some
[13:07:34] time let's give Misha some time as I
[13:07:37] believe he'll unveil the secret of the
[13:07:40] dream bubble all right but there are
[13:07:43] doors all over the place which one
[13:07:46] should we choose
[13:07:49] H I
[13:07:51] guess maybe this
[13:07:53] way okay sure thing M show I'm not
[13:07:57] entirely sure but let's give it a
[13:08:04] try wait you managed to choose the right
[13:08:07] door that was on point dude I'm telling
[13:08:09] you I'm telling
[13:08:10] you this place is quite different from
[13:08:14] the
[13:08:15] hotel but I just I feel like I've been
[13:08:19] here before
[13:08:21] and even lived here for a while if I
[13:08:24] remember correctly there should be a
[13:08:27] fireplace down that hallway Clocky and I
[13:08:31] used to sit by the fire listening to the
[13:08:35] crackling of firewood
[13:08:37] and and the room on the other side was
[13:08:41] the toy room okay I loved spreading out
[13:08:45] all the toys from the Box on the floor
[13:08:47] and making up stories for each of them
[13:08:51] hold this doesn't make sense didn't I
[13:08:55] grow up in dreamlux Reef
[13:08:59] so what is this place this could be a
[13:09:02] case of
[13:09:03] Amnesia don't worry Misha it's common
[13:09:06] for everyone to forget certain aspects
[13:09:09] of the past those memories haven't
[13:09:12] vanished they're just lying in the
[13:09:14] depths of your mind since this place
[13:09:16] seems familiar to you why don't we
[13:09:19] explore a few more rooms and see if you
[13:09:22] can recall anything more yeah then let's
[13:09:26] check out the rooms
[13:09:31] I tick
[13:09:33] tock tick tock oh no not Tik tock
[13:09:37] [Music]
[13:09:39] I beep beep beep noises from the
[13:09:42] room origami bird you and origami bird
[13:09:47] are friends yeah it's a member of the
[13:09:51] compass crew just like clarky and Miss
[13:09:53] mirror and there's more than just one
[13:09:55] origami bird they follow Miss mirror's
[13:09:58] orders and handle all sorts of jobs on
[13:10:00] the ship they're the best sailors
[13:10:08] sail could you tell us more about the
[13:10:10] compass
[13:10:11] Misha the compass is a ship Bound for
[13:10:14] the new world Clocky and his Partners
[13:10:17] travel through layers of fog to the
[13:10:19] depths of the sea Whenever there is
[13:10:21] danger Clocky will use a compass and
[13:10:24] guide the ship in the right direction
[13:10:26] that's a great story but in the pentacon
[13:10:30] cartoon Clocky and his Partners have
[13:10:32] always lived in dreamville and never
[13:10:35] ventured out huh
[13:10:38] oh that does seem something doesn't add
[13:10:41] up weird I I clearly
[13:10:46] remember Clocky arrived in the new world
[13:10:49] in the end perhaps Clocky has a hidden
[13:10:53] past so where has Clocky
[13:10:57] gone did he it will protect you from
[13:11:01] harm just like they did with Clocky
[13:11:08] H
[13:11:10] okay
[13:11:13] very
[13:11:14] [Music]
[13:11:27] H male that's the name now we all know
[13:11:32] him as the watch maker is that your dad
[13:11:34] Misha so who is he talking to
[13:11:38] do you know anything about it Misha I'm
[13:11:40] sorry I don't know much about the watch
[13:11:43] maker but M anything special about that
[13:11:47] name m oh is okay well close I basically
[13:11:51] knew it his Grandpa's name
[13:11:54] okay
[13:11:57] Grandpa do you mean you're the
[13:12:00] watchmaker's grandson but we haven't
[13:12:03] heard anything about the watch maker
[13:12:05] having descendants
[13:12:08] and the name male is not rare yeah
[13:12:11] perhaps it's merely a coincidence also
[13:12:13] isn't M and Misha the same name more
[13:12:15] about your grandpa male yeah sure he was
[13:12:19] a Seafair who fearlessly ventured into
[13:12:22] mysterious seas and storms he was always
[13:12:25] on the sea and had lots of friends who
[13:12:27] accompanied him on his
[13:12:32] travels he didn't want me to call him
[13:12:35] Grandpa because that would make him
[13:12:37] sound old he believed he was still young
[13:12:41] the name Mel was given to him by his
[13:12:43] parents male and Delise El renowned sea
[13:12:48] farers Chad Elise would or
[13:12:52] no would you pull or not
[13:13:01] [Music]
[13:13:05] pull absolutely not you mean absolutely
[13:13:07] not have you seen her do you have
[13:13:09] eyes every time he came back he'd share
[13:13:13] his log book with me and tell me about
[13:13:15] his adventures at
[13:13:17] Sea I want to become a great Adventurer
[13:13:20] just like
[13:13:22] him it appears that the seaf far has
[13:13:25] nothing to do with the watch maker so
[13:13:28] perhaps it's just a coincidence so where
[13:13:31] is your Grandpa now he went off on a New
[13:13:35] Journey and it's been
[13:13:38] quite a while you don't have to fine you
[13:13:40] don't have to time out the first time
[13:13:43] chatter it's okay drama frogs are bound
[13:13:45] to happen it's okay you can keep them as
[13:13:48] pets I think I hear the sound of water
[13:13:53] whoa wa silver
[13:13:58] wolf yo what the wait let me put silver
[13:14:01] my team oh I can't no I can't change
[13:14:05] wait can can I come back with silver I
[13:14:07] want to take a picture
[13:14:10] uh welcome to my
[13:14:18] world no way he's doing all this for a
[13:14:20] [ __ ] post dude you you
[13:14:24] underestimate oh no I am now aware of oh
[13:14:28] skip
[13:14:32] button okay cool wait what the [ __ ] wait
[13:14:35] did I not change my theme
[13:14:37] wait what happened you forgot to
[13:14:43] deploy wait no I did oh I just okay I
[13:14:46] guess oh [ __ ] you can't just Photoshop
[13:14:48] her in dude I don't even have Photoshop
[13:14:51] wait how do I make this [ __ ] post and
[13:14:53] whatever it's probably not even that
[13:14:55] funny it's fine oh it's gone okay well
[13:14:58] wait no it's not wait why is this one
[13:15:00] still there with the people already did
[13:15:01] that 100 times oh wait but the quest
[13:15:03] just came out today how did people
[13:15:05] already do it it just came out
[13:15:07] look there it
[13:15:11] is the water resembles a precious Jewel
[13:15:15] every time I gaze at the shimmering
[13:15:17] lights beneath the waves it feels as you
[13:15:20] look at the quest description okay I can
[13:15:22] check standing by your
[13:15:24] side have you recalled anything Misha
[13:15:28] yeah I saw these sentences in Grandpa's
[13:15:31] log book he used to say that despite the
[13:15:35] Perils of the sea whenever he stood on
[13:15:38] the deck in the afternoon overlooking
[13:15:40] the sparkling waves he would think of
[13:15:43] this fountain in front of his house he
[13:15:46] often said that those moments felt like
[13:15:48] returning to his family's side and the
[13:15:51] difficulties at Sea didn't seem quite as
[13:15:54] challenging you know I quite understand
[13:15:58] such sentiments don't s I'll start
[13:16:00] getting great hair you're talking like
[13:16:01] an
[13:16:03] elder hey I'm not an elder perhaps every
[13:16:08] Adventurer far from home carries a
[13:16:10] fountain within their soul even though
[13:16:13] the other side of the sea remains
[13:16:15] shrouded in the unknown the fountain in
[13:16:18] front of his house serves as a compass
[13:16:21] leading him back to his cherished ones
[13:16:24] yeah while Grandpa was at home we would
[13:16:27] stand by The Fountain and place the
[13:16:30] cbass a toy boat that I made into the
[13:16:33] pool back then I would ask him when I
[13:16:36] could go Adventures like him and he
[13:16:39] would always like wait his [ __ ] eyes
[13:16:40] is literally a loophole it's a key
[13:16:43] keyhole It seems the taale is truly a
[13:16:46] seaf farer and has nothing to do with
[13:16:48] the watch maker yeah based on Misha's
[13:16:52] Recollections the scenes in the dream
[13:16:55] bubble appear but this raises more
[13:16:58] questions according to Misha he was
[13:17:01] clearly born on an oceanic Planet could
[13:17:03] this be some sort of
[13:17:07] metaphor perhaps the C refers to the
[13:17:10] memory zone I'm
[13:17:14] sorry I don't know but my memories keep
[13:17:18] pouring out uncontrollably is mar
[13:17:21] cooking water flowing from a fountain
[13:17:24] perhaps I'll
[13:17:29] I'll we're going to the opposite side
[13:17:33] right no wait can I get past this here
[13:17:37] no what if I jump sorry I don't know why
[13:17:40] I made that joke sorry sorry sorry sorry
[13:17:43] okay huh something feels like there's a
[13:17:46] chest here different about this
[13:17:49] place this is it I remember this
[13:17:57] Corridor I want to go
[13:18:00] too up ahead
[13:18:03] is Grandpa's study
[13:18:07] it was in that room that I saw him the
[13:18:12] last
[13:18:15] time tick tick
[13:18:21] tick
[13:18:28] huh the atmosphere in this room feels
[13:18:31] totally different Misha you finally come
[13:18:38] Clocky you're
[13:18:41] here are those books on the bookshelf
[13:18:44] log books left behind by that seaf farer
[13:18:48] yeah whenever he came back he placed a
[13:18:52] log book on the bookshelf in his room so
[13:18:54] he's a cartographer like M contain
[13:18:56] records of his expeditions to every
[13:18:58] corner of the world he described our
[13:19:02] world as a fountain to ensure that
[13:19:04] everyone had land to settle on
[13:19:07] he had to continue exploring the sea and
[13:19:11] search for the in months sea on that day
[13:19:16] he called me to his study telling me
[13:19:20] that he was embarking on another journey
[13:19:23] I asked him if I could go with him but
[13:19:26] he said that my adventure lay
[13:19:29] elsewhere and told me to stay
[13:19:31] home and patiently await a certain sound
[13:19:35] at the door
[13:19:37] sound he told me about a vast ocean in
[13:19:40] the
[13:19:42] sky an ocean of
[13:19:45] stars he spoke of a train that
[13:19:48] transports children with a desire to
[13:19:50] venture far away the magical School Bus
[13:19:53] traversing the Sea of stars without ever
[13:19:56] stopping he said that he knew the crew
[13:20:00] on the train oh and that he had asked
[13:20:04] them to take me along wait that's us he
[13:20:07] said the journey I had always dreamed
[13:20:09] of what start there a train could it be
[13:20:15] it's oh [ __ ] the astral
[13:20:17] Express I I remember now Grandpa's
[13:20:22] friends are a group of n who came to
[13:20:24] this world to resolve a disaster causing
[13:20:26] I just realized something but I don't
[13:20:27] want to say it then he gave his pocket
[13:20:31] watch to
[13:20:32] me it was his cherish's treasure appear
[13:20:36] in every one of his Adventure Tales it
[13:20:39] basically he's basically saying that
[13:20:41] like he's going to join the astral
[13:20:42] Express but I haven't seen Misha in the
[13:20:44] astral Express in like any piece of
[13:20:46] media so that probably means he's going
[13:20:48] to die he said as long as I kept moving
[13:20:52] forward I'd eventually reach my desired
[13:20:57] destination and then no no you're going
[13:20:58] to join don't worry the distant sound of
[13:21:00] a train
[13:21:02] whistle echoing throughout the room
[13:21:06] cuz I feel like in the 4.3 thing know
[13:21:09] that whistle didn't we
[13:21:12] yeah I think I can still find the
[13:21:16] way maybe he's the janitor true this is
[13:21:19] the dream do you remember looks like
[13:21:22] we're
[13:21:23] just I'm I'm the best at this watch
[13:21:25] never mind
[13:21:29] [Music]
[13:21:30] watch 4.3 question mark no like the 4.3
[13:21:33] preview stream didn't have like Misha in
[13:21:35] the express being like like oh I'm Misha
[13:21:38] of the
[13:21:39] as
[13:21:41] this is my room of clocks wait he's the
[13:21:44] clock master I spent my time waiting for
[13:21:46] Grandpa to return from his voyage Walder
[13:21:50] gave me this Workshop oh 2.3 my bad my
[13:21:53] bad my bad 2.3 my bad here I learned how
[13:21:57] to repair Clockwork in Gears out of my
[13:22:00] fondness of precision
[13:22:03] mechanics in my dreams I was the captain
[13:22:06] of the compass
[13:22:09] I I was born and raised here so this
[13:22:14] building in the dream bubble is your
[13:22:17] childhood home yes this dream bubble
[13:22:21] itself is my
[13:22:24] home looks like you've remembered
[13:22:26] everything now wait wait why does it
[13:22:29] feel like everyone else knows something
[13:22:31] I don't
[13:22:38] March do you remember when she mentioned
[13:22:41] a Clocky that only she could
[13:22:44] see yeah the little guy here right but
[13:22:48] we all saw him in dream flux Reef right
[13:22:52] and Mr Yang even greeted him looks like
[13:22:56] everyone on the astral Express has a
[13:22:58] childlike Spirit the answer lies in the
[13:23:01] astral Express her experience shows that
[13:23:04] neither Firefly nor acaron can see this
[13:23:07] Clocky and when we were in dreamlux Reef
[13:23:10] you may have noticed that for some
[13:23:12] reason nobody outside of the crew had
[13:23:15] ever talked with
[13:23:16] Clocky wait
[13:23:20] really a mimic life that can only be
[13:23:23] seen by a select few it's just like a
[13:23:26] hidden message wait a second by someone
[13:23:29] for the name wait a second it was but
[13:23:32] Misha can see Clocky too right they even
[13:23:35] grew up M left for us but Misha hasn't
[13:23:38] started the way of the trailblaze yet
[13:23:41] that's the key to the mystery March no
[13:23:44] take a moment to recall have you ever
[13:23:46] seen any I thought I thought I thought I
[13:23:48] thought the kids could see it couldn't
[13:23:51] the kids see it
[13:23:53] wait no way that's the answer March
[13:23:58] 7th this dream bubble is the place where
[13:24:01] I was
[13:24:02] born and
[13:24:04] I I'm a dwell in this
[13:24:07] dream just like a memory Zone
[13:24:10] meme I should have stayed here and
[13:24:13] waited for you but when reality and
[13:24:16] memories
[13:24:17] merged I unconsciously pushed open that
[13:24:20] door and left the bubble with Clocky
[13:24:23] what the hell so it's not that the
[13:24:26] watchmaker's dream bubble is empty but
[13:24:30] rather the stuff inside ran
[13:24:33] away and the whistle you heard was was
[13:24:36] the sound of the express arriving at
[13:24:38] pentacon that's one way to see it but I
[13:24:41] believe there's a longer story behind
[13:24:44] all this it's best for Misha himself to
[13:24:47] explain all the m is going to be like
[13:24:48] see when I was younger there was a bird
[13:24:51] with your name now should we call you
[13:24:53] Misha or M thank you all for helping me
[13:24:58] ReDiscover my true self
[13:25:01] now please allow me to reintroduce
[13:25:04] myself
[13:25:06] I was born on laka in the prir system
[13:25:10] adopted by seaf farers Mel and
[13:25:14] Char they gave me a
[13:25:16] treasure a name that carried their
[13:25:23] hopes M Char legor wait I knew it I
[13:25:27] called this like 2.0 Misha sorry wait
[13:25:31] but literally 2.0 cuz I was like Mel and
[13:25:33] Misha are the same name
[13:25:38] [Music]
[13:25:41] if you prefer you can call me by a more
[13:25:43] familiar name the watchmaker so you're
[13:25:48] the watchmaker himself
[13:25:52] unfortunately that legendary
[13:25:55] figure is no
[13:25:58] more I'm only a reflection of his life
[13:26:02] as for the child who has been with you
[13:26:05] he's the the innocent protagonist of
[13:26:07] Misha's childood
[13:26:10] dream friend of
[13:26:12] Clocky a Young
[13:26:14] Apprentice and a future mechanic wait is
[13:26:18] this finina falor no kind of not really
[13:26:20] I mean they kind of look like finina no
[13:26:22] okay sorry sorry sorry I overcooked
[13:26:24] sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
[13:26:26] sorry no just cuz you know Fino is like
[13:26:28] innocent falor no
[13:26:31] okay and this also marks the beginning
[13:26:35] of his journey devoted to the trail oh
[13:26:37] [ __ ] I overcooked I ruined it at the end
[13:26:39] of the
[13:26:40] journey I left this little
[13:26:43] flame which I so
[13:26:46] cherished in my deepest
[13:26:49] dreams hoping to pass it on into the
[13:26:52] namess of future
[13:26:55] Generations however he somehow left the
[13:27:00] dream bubble and forgot all about his
[13:27:03] task I apologize for all confusion this
[13:27:09] caused because he was born with a desire
[13:27:12] to Trail plays wasn't
[13:27:14] he I don't think Misha has forgotten his
[13:27:17] role as a guide he remembered it and
[13:27:20] that's why he mistakenly appeared as a
[13:27:22] hotel dman in Her Dream from the very
[13:27:24] beginning the one who brought our
[13:27:26] unconscious friend here must have been
[13:27:28] Misha if that's the case we encountered
[13:27:31] the watchmaker's Legacy from the
[13:27:33] beginning didn't we well
[13:27:36] I have a sarcastic friend who says I
[13:27:38] always take big detours and end up back
[13:27:41] where I
[13:27:42] started perhaps that's what every name
[13:27:45] this has to go
[13:27:46] through but in the end you found
[13:27:50] me I'm sure you're all wondering what my
[13:27:53] legacy
[13:27:54] is I believe my Hound has mentioned the
[13:27:57] stellon and my
[13:27:59] wealth if I may
[13:28:01] apologize the Stell part is
[13:28:04] real as for my wealth however it's
[13:28:09] nothing more than a baseless
[13:28:11] rumor I left my homeland as a child and
[13:28:15] embarked on the Journey of
[13:28:18] trailblaze I traveled to various
[13:28:21] planets until finally reaching
[13:28:25] asdon where my friends and I built the
[13:28:27] original
[13:28:29] Penton and fought for its future ever
[13:28:32] since I've been moving forward all my
[13:28:35] life
[13:28:37] doing what I could to overcome the
[13:28:39] obstacles in my
[13:28:41] path But
[13:28:44] ultimately my journey reached its end
[13:28:46] huh and I left behind no possessions
[13:28:50] worth entrusting so if you ask what's
[13:28:53] left within this worn out train engine
[13:28:57] that can be called a
[13:28:58] legacy I suppose it's the things that
[13:29:01] are still I'm sorry sorry still burning
[13:29:03] in the engine's furnace
[13:29:06] now that you're well aware of the
[13:29:07] current situation of
[13:29:09] pentacon I certainly hope that you'll
[13:29:11] help me get this world back on
[13:29:14] track but I'll leave that decision to
[13:29:17] you for the path of
[13:29:19] trailblaze is never paved by others all
[13:29:23] I have for you is a story and two
[13:29:28] gifts I want to give you my pocket wash
[13:29:32] okay it has accompanied me throughout my
[13:29:35] long journey and my hat
[13:29:38] too the one who navigated for wait is
[13:29:41] that why Harmony MC has a hat maybe
[13:29:43] maybe not I don't know thought in my
[13:29:46] mind this does not look like Harmony
[13:29:48] MC's hat Expedition will never end now
[13:29:53] it's time for you to make your
[13:29:56] choice once you've made up your mind
[13:30:00] open that door and enter who's Harmon M
[13:30:03] I've made a booill guide man I played
[13:30:05] the character
[13:30:08] just I know what Harmony MC does they're
[13:30:10] pretty good I just for you at the end of
[13:30:13] this Corridor of
[13:30:16] time all right everyone although I don't
[13:30:19] think anyone will have any objections
[13:30:21] that's pretty cool though I'll choose
[13:30:23] the trailblaze I
[13:30:26] object of course we've come to in that
[13:30:29] case it's unanimous then let's proceed
[13:30:32] together to the end of this stream
[13:30:36] it's actually crazy how every HMC is
[13:30:38] broken Harmony MC broken Havoc MC broken

[13:36:35] full of
[13:36:36] clocks those wall clocks and pocket
[13:36:39] watches grew up with you and were your
[13:36:41] best friends yes but what I didn't
[13:36:45] mention was there's a funny
[13:36:50] misunderstanding behind
[13:36:53] it I was a kid and there was always a
[13:36:58] special pocket watch in my
[13:37:01] memories it was with my grandpa
[13:37:05] guiding him on his sea voyages and
[13:37:09] leading the way in his every adventure
[13:37:12] story I wanted to have a pocket watch
[13:37:16] like that
[13:37:17] too and that's when you appeared in my
[13:37:22] dreams it sounded like he like aged down
[13:37:25] like like became like 50 years younger
[13:37:26] when he said that's he's like and that's
[13:37:30] when you appeared
[13:37:32] yeah every night we boarded the
[13:37:38] compass and set sail together but you
[13:37:41] know
[13:37:42] what it wasn't until the day my Grandpa
[13:37:46] gave it to me that I
[13:37:49] realized it wasn't a pocket watch at all
[13:37:53] huh it was a
[13:37:57] compass what so your name should have
[13:38:02] been
[13:38:04] compy what the [ __ ] is compassing and

[13:39:43] entirely unremarkable existence I set
[13:39:45] out on the trailblazing journey so I
[13:39:47] might learn about life itself and
[13:39:48] everything within however the more I
[13:39:50] learned the more I found myself lost in
[13:39:51] confusion and distress I thought that I
[13:39:53] would be able to learn how to live a
[13:39:54] better life but all I Learned was how to
[13:39:55] elegantly face the ending Fate has
[13:39:57] paired you with nil how to elegantly
[13:39:59] face the ending Fate has parody with The
[13:40:01] Hil everyone in life will eventually

[13:40:35] a nameless as a person we have the right
[13:40:36] to reflect we have the right to act we
[13:40:38] have the right to define or want to do
[13:40:40] chat shut up I'm getting distracted by
[13:40:42] chat we right to Define our own
[13:40:44] endings I'm closing chat okay chat's
[13:40:47] closed uh we have the right to move
[13:40:48] forward as we advance on the road to our
[13:40:50] own ending there are many things that
[13:40:51] people are capable of and our endings
[13:40:53] will thus take
[13:40:55] on dud I keep looking at fade be it's

[13:41:26] endings we have the right to move
[13:41:27] forward as we advance down the the road
[13:41:29] to our own ending there are many things
[13:41:30] that people are capable of and our
[13:41:32] ending will thus take on a completely
[13:41:33] new meaning a name list is not in
[13:41:35] temporary dreams nor would they forsake
[13:41:37] their birth rights due to pain and
[13:41:38] suffering do you still recall the
[13:41:39] question I left in my invitation letter
[13:41:40] Trailblazer why stop me why does life
[13:41:44] Slumber people Slumber so that
[13:41:46] eventually they can awaken from their
[13:41:47] dreams this is the answer that an old
[13:41:49] nameless devoted his entire life to
[13:41:53] finding
[13:41:55] uh
[13:42:01] okay I've traveled far enough and it's
[13:42:05] time for a little break
[13:42:08] oh so no wonder he doesn't join our
[13:42:10] [ __ ] Asal
[13:42:12] Express when you're
[13:42:15] rested no I'll stay here and
[13:42:20] then this is where it
[13:42:24] ends this
[13:42:26] is where it
[13:42:28] [Music]
[13:42:30] ends what do you mean Misha you told me
[13:42:35] that the trailblazing Expedition would
[13:42:38] never
[13:42:40] end yeah that's what I
[13:42:44] said so now it's up to you to decide
[13:42:47] your next destination my next
[13:42:52] destination what's that supposed to
[13:42:55] Misha you're acting weird
[13:42:59] today if you're feeling
[13:43:01] down no I I'm not feeling down down as
[13:43:06] for
[13:43:07] Clockwork yeah it resolves all problems
[13:43:11] in this
[13:43:13] dream so do you know what Clockwork
[13:43:17] actually
[13:43:20] is I'm not quite
[13:43:25] sure well everyone gets lost at times
[13:43:29] they may hesitate and doubt which way to
[13:43:32] go that happens in this Dreamscape and
[13:43:36] Beyond but don't worry everyone goes
[13:43:39] through moments of uncertainty and
[13:43:42] hesitation
[13:43:43] eventually they gather the courage to
[13:43:46] make bold decisions whether it's calming
[13:43:50] joyful angry or or sad all they need is
[13:43:55] a little nudge to take that step toward
[13:43:57] where they truly
[13:43:59] belong I
[13:44:01] mean the little n i mean you're
[13:44:03] literally mind controlling them to be
[13:44:05] happy I don't know about little nud but
[13:44:07] and I hope you'll share it with others
[13:44:10] okay such is the essence of clockwork
[13:44:13] the will of the
[13:44:16] trailblaze oh clar's hands spin around
[13:44:21] non indicating confusion
[13:44:24] frustration and
[13:44:26] weakness but oh that's our hat I'm not
[13:44:29] supposed to know that yet okay never
[13:44:31] mind just like your hands all pointing
[13:44:35] at wait what the this guy kind of looks
[13:44:37] like this is where my journey
[13:44:41] ends from now
[13:44:43] on it is your path to walk that guy
[13:44:47] looks sick he look like a mix of net and
[13:44:49] Pio means taking paths your predecessors
[13:44:52] for and venturing even
[13:44:55] further what if what if is is dream what
[13:44:59] if he is pi does not belong to
[13:45:01] [Music]
[13:45:03] order who the [ __ ] is
[13:45:05] [Music]
[13:45:15] I can't believe that Eon would cast a
[13:45:17] glance at penacon at a time like
[13:45:20] this is it because of the resonance from
[13:45:22] the legacy of the trail place and she
[13:45:24] pays or perhaps the bond between you is
[13:45:28] so strong that it even impresses an
[13:45:33] eon well there might be be another
[13:45:36] possibility perhaps they want to witness
[13:45:38] on behalf of the Fallen eons who will
[13:45:41] hold the future of
[13:45:44] penacon if that's the case on behalf of
[13:45:48] the dream master of penone and the
[13:45:54] 17,33 the oak family a big ass family
[13:45:57] I'm extending a formal invitation to all
[13:45:59] of you I'm cordially inviting you all to
[13:46:02] the pentacon Grand Theater to
[13:46:05] participate in the upcoming charmony
[13:46:07] festival and of course you won't be in
[13:46:11] the audience but on Center Stage since
[13:46:14] the future of the stellon penacon and
[13:46:18] even the entire Cosmos is at stake let's
[13:46:21] draw a conclusion there if you truly
[13:46:25] believe in ail's path then show me their
[13:46:29] courage and determination
[13:46:37] good time to stop what do you mean I
[13:46:38] assume that is the quest not ending
[13:46:40] [ __ ] we just became Harmony

[13:47:54] you all right one more I'll save it for
[13:47:56] a key moment in the story does that mean
[13:47:59] he wants to fight US during I'm afraid
[13:48:01] so this is weird aren't Ark villains
[13:48:04] usually plotting some dirty conspir well
[13:48:06] in my opinion I sensed a strong
[13:48:09] conviction and a desire for dominance
[13:48:11] that's why you think if we fight Sunday
[13:48:12] he's going to tell us the story about
[13:48:14] the bird when he was a child if evil why
[13:48:16] so nice wait a second wait a second did

[13:48:29] tweet here am I listen
[13:48:41] [Music]
[13:48:46] you did not invent that no but I
[13:48:48] guarantee you I have the most popular
[13:48:50] tweet of that in terms of hoyo space so
[13:48:52] the highest likelihood for a hoyo writer
[13:48:55] to have seen it is through me if evil
[13:48:58] why hot images okay I'm look I'm
[13:49:01] literally right here I don't know what
[13:49:02] the [ __ ] this is AR Lino MS how many
[13:49:04] outf does have this has 300 okay sorry
[13:49:07] the power's gone to my head my bad my
[13:49:09] bad also that other voice line wait a
[13:49:12] second the person that said St isn't
[13:49:14] cringe you're not getting away with it
[13:49:16] I'm clipping this no no I saw some [ __ ]
[13:49:18] one second of the won't be a big deal I
[13:49:20] saw some [ __ ] that makes Ghana Wana look
[13:49:22] like a saint one second this other voice
[13:49:24] line says I flexed on him too hard with
[13:49:26] my Peak swag guess I messed around and
[13:49:29] found out
[13:49:31] huh I'm sorry bad like I'm trying to
[13:49:34] defend you
[13:49:36] but fate
[13:49:39] but anyway we can't leave the stellon
[13:49:42] unchecked this is about trailblazing a
[13:49:45] bright future for pentacon and
[13:49:47] fulfilling M's and his predecessors long
[13:49:50] cherished
[13:49:51] wishes now that we've taken up the
[13:49:53] mantle we can't afford to fail
[13:49:56] them however the same applies to the
[13:50:00] order their plan didn't materialize
[13:50:03] overnight
[13:50:05] and they have the profound Collective
[13:50:07] consciousness of the planet of
[13:50:08] festivities behind them a desire to
[13:50:11] dream to Slumber and Escape
[13:50:16] reality all those hidden emotions have
[13:50:18] given birth to the sweet dream of the
[13:50:20] order they've harnessed the will of an
[13:50:23] entire planet to create an eon so true
[13:50:28] this confrontation is far more
[13:50:30] complicated than a simple power
[13:50:32] struggle to secure penton's
[13:50:36] future fighting on the stage alone is
[13:50:39] not enough what do you mean are you not
[13:50:43] coming with us I believe Firefly is
[13:50:46] trying to say that
[13:50:51] mm before I
[13:50:53] left the destiny slave told me that this
[13:50:56] journey would bring Unforgettable
[13:51:00] rewards even though the script he gave
[13:51:02] me only had a few lines I couldn't
[13:51:05] ignore them because one of the lines
[13:51:08] said I experience death three times in
[13:51:13] the land of the
[13:51:14] dreams three
[13:51:17] times this can't be serious March also
[13:51:19] has one earring only the first time was
[13:51:23] a painful death when I was stabbed by
[13:51:26] the blade of
[13:51:27] dorcy which led to all subsequent events
[13:51:31] Firefly only has stuff on the one side
[13:51:32] of her head the script will always
[13:51:34] always come
[13:51:36] true
[13:51:38] but in a way that will only be revealed
[13:51:41] when that page is
[13:51:42] turned so now I've understood the
[13:51:45] meaning of my second
[13:51:50] death and I am prepared to face
[13:51:54] it if all
[13:51:56] go my efforts will provide crucial
[13:51:59] support for
[13:52:00] you only by achieving victory in this
[13:52:03] battle can we secure a future for
[13:52:08] pentacon and only
[13:52:11] then my third and final
[13:52:15] death yeah Firefly pauses way longer
[13:52:18] than other characters I don't know if
[13:52:19] it's on purpose or not but it's the most
[13:52:22] terrible
[13:52:23] form does that mean the true death where
[13:52:28] everyone in pentacon loses themsel
[13:52:31] completely in the Eternal sweet dream of
[13:52:34] the
[13:52:35] order we must do everything we can to
[13:52:38] prevent that have you o i mean to click
[13:52:42] otherwise I wouldn't be here thank you
[13:52:45] again for your assistance for the astral
[13:52:47] Express may we meet again in
[13:52:51] reality
[13:52:53] yeah farewell
[13:52:55] everyone may your trailblazing
[13:52:58] Expedition Never

[13:53:17] earth it bloomed in the morning

[13:53:44] disappear from cosmic history and the
[13:53:47] everflame Mansion will take its
[13:53:50] place in the not too distant future

[13:53:56] invitation that's your next stop land of
[13:54:00] the
[13:54:02] dreams pentacon
[13:54:04] I hope you find whatever you seek there
[13:54:09] be it
[13:54:10] answers or
[13:54:13] salvation you mean my three deaths
[13:54:18] silverwolf told me about it it's such a
[13:54:21] shame that it's not part of my script
[13:54:24] well I want to
[13:54:27] live I'm never afraid of death
[13:54:32] dude of death is eternal life and
[13:54:37] that's that's something I'll never
[13:54:39] desire the pauses between Firefly is
[13:54:41] like commas like the one part of s the
[13:54:43] next part it's like it's like and now
[13:54:45] Firefly on the scene of the
[13:54:48] action thank you so much we're reporting
[13:54:52] live people
[13:54:54] die and I am no exception
[13:54:59] sorry death is like a
[13:55:02] script A fate that cannot be
[13:55:07] divied but that's exactly why we have to
[13:55:13] choose where we want to rest from I'm
[13:55:14] not it's fine she's just on high ping it
[13:55:16] happens it's okay do you exist just to
[13:55:21] perish are you not the same
[13:55:24] Blade the end you desire is not one
[13:55:28] dictated by others she's dying wait is
[13:55:30] she I guess she did tell us that okay my
[13:55:32] bad okay but so is baiju and I'm make
[13:55:34] fun of him coughing sorry sorry sorry oh
[13:55:36] but when it's a cute girl then I can't
[13:55:38] make fun of her sorry I didn't mean to I
[13:55:39] didn't mean to please don't die Firefly
[13:55:41] I didn't mean to
[13:55:43] sorry if I were to die
[13:55:47] now I would only be a weapon no don't
[13:55:51] die Firefly you will live I
[13:55:55] believe I should die as a
[13:55:58] human though its definition escapes me
[13:56:02] isn't this the answer that ordinary
[13:56:04] people look for their whole
[13:56:07] lives a name that can be carved onto
[13:56:09] their Tombstone okay the tombstone that
[13:56:12] belongs to me once bore the
[13:56:16] inscription gloth iron
[13:56:20] Cavalry then it changed she doesn't
[13:56:22] speak this slow in other dubs okay
[13:56:24] someone in my chat said it was a bug
[13:56:25] which is kind of why I've been [ __ ]
[13:56:26] posting but if it's intentional it's
[13:56:28] intentional so I can't tell if it's a
[13:56:29] bug then I'm making fun of it if it's
[13:56:31] not then my bad I don't [ __ ] know I
[13:56:32] mean I don't care that much but it will
[13:56:35] bear the name
[13:56:38] Firefly and all the Brilliance she
[13:56:41] showed at the end of her
[13:56:45] life I'm outo place right
[13:56:50] okay that's quite unexpected old
[13:56:55] man who would have thought your crazy
[13:56:58] plann would actually
[13:57:01] work do all you nameless fools just act
[13:57:04] on a whim okay Gallagher's also talking
[13:57:07] slow though my bad maybe my brain is
[13:57:08] rotted to an
[13:57:10] end the nameless may be young oh [ __ ]
[13:57:14] they had the ability to achieve this
[13:57:16] goal just like you did in your
[13:57:23] time it's a shame you won't be able to
[13:57:25] see it
[13:57:27] firsthand maybe I won't
[13:57:30] either once something fictional is seen
[13:57:33] through ceases to
[13:57:35] exist yeah not just those
[13:57:38] nameless even Mr Wings is just like
[13:57:41] you
[13:57:43] stubborn won't listen or give up no
[13:57:46] matter
[13:57:48] what well fate is unpredictable I
[13:57:53] guess if we weren't Bound by those
[13:57:55] cursed
[13:57:57] paths maybe we could have had some good
[13:57:59] talks but in the end we managed to do it
[13:58:04] now we can find
[13:58:07] Solace remember how those idiots cursed
[13:58:10] us they said go to hell you worthless
[13:58:14] traitors well I don't know if they
[13:58:17] really meant it
[13:58:19] but if Longing For Freedom means going
[13:58:21] to hell then I'll be joining you soon
[13:58:24] you
[13:58:27] fool let's get together and have supper
[13:58:29] again in
[13:58:32] hell oh I almost
[13:58:35] forgot there's one more thing here's to
[13:58:38] you a glass of hello and goodbye
[13:58:41] Trailblazer to the
[13:58:44] imperfect tomorrow what are you doing
[13:58:49] Gallagher it's warm here isn't
[13:58:53] it you're lucky to have found Shelter
[13:58:56] From the
[13:58:58] rain let alone fresh berries in
[13:59:02] this Des so its
[13:59:07] place I was just following the scent of
[13:59:09] life it's particularly strong in a place
[13:59:12] like this it's a shame these berries
[13:59:15] don't have much flavor I thought she was
[13:59:17] eating like a
[13:59:19] snowball serious that's a
[13:59:21] berry in case you didn't know this fruit
[13:59:24] is pretty
[13:59:26] juicy the only downside is that when you
[13:59:29] chew it it becomes extreme L
[13:59:36] spicy
[13:59:38] okay have you lost your sense of
[13:59:45] taste I can still taste certain things
[13:59:48] like a faint
[13:59:50] sweetness nice and spicy I didn't
[13:59:53] process that before coming here I
[13:59:55] stopped by a place called orcon it had
[13:59:58] Barren Cliffs and nights lit by
[14:00:00] bonfires burgundy snow would fall from
[14:00:03] the sky and when it landed on my tongue
[14:00:06] it tasted like raspberries the flavor
[14:00:09] wasn't exactly sweet but it left a
[14:00:12] lasting
[14:00:13] impression when I think back on my past
[14:00:16] I realize that what's tying everything
[14:00:19] together isn't the big events but rather
[14:00:22] these small yet Unforgettable moments
[14:00:25] don't worry about it losing oneself is a
[14:00:29] reality that every self Annihilator must
[14:00:31] face at least I haven't Haven completely
[14:00:34] lost my senses and memories yet well
[14:00:37] congratulations on adding another
[14:00:40] footnote to your journey by the way are
[14:00:44] you always alone I mean there's Black
[14:00:47] Swan no no I had a companion in orron
[14:00:49] never mind she's a short nameless girl
[14:00:51] who aspired to explore ex she always
[14:00:54] said she'd walk a path deeper and
[14:00:57] farther than
[14:01:00] aavil quite an ambition for such a small
[14:01:05] who so what what
[14:01:10] happened
[14:01:12] she became stagnant
[14:01:15] water is this a dead hongkai character
[14:01:18] Kiana is Kiana dead thought Kiana was
[14:01:20] alive
[14:01:21] Kiana dead in act I I it is revealed
[14:01:25] that Kiana is in fact alive I don't know
[14:01:27] I'm spoiling my [ __ ] whatever sorry
[14:01:30] well my C spoiler sorry man I'm sorry
[14:01:36] condolences I don't need them the girl
[14:01:39] left with a smile she never regretted
[14:01:42] her choice and most definitely wanted me
[14:01:44] to say goodbye with a
[14:01:45] smile so that's what I did okay look
[14:01:49] look look look bro this is from a Reddit
[14:01:52] post that is 4 years old it's not like
[14:01:54] this came out today sorry sorry
[14:01:55] sorry that's proof that you're grieving
[14:01:58] for
[14:02:01] her or perhaps perhaps I'm just
[14:02:05] afraid
[14:02:07] afraid I rarely sense that emotion from
[14:02:12] you what do you fear I'm afraid I'll
[14:02:15] forget the 30 days I spent with her just
[14:02:18] like all the other days in my
[14:02:21] life most of them have already washed
[14:02:23] away with the rain disappearing into an
[14:02:25] unseen
[14:02:27] realm I fear that those Vivid red
[14:02:29] memories will fade away
[14:02:31] too there isn't much color left and
[14:02:35] besides this faint warm red there's
[14:02:38] almost nothing hard to
[14:02:41] imagine a ranger accustomed to Bloodshed
[14:02:45] dest destru finding warm in red color
[14:02:47] because sorry I have experienced this
[14:02:49] warmth many
[14:02:52] times long ago I promised someone that
[14:02:55] I'd bring it to more
[14:02:57] people and that for every remaining
[14:02:59] moment of my life I'd strive
[14:03:02] for a better ending for all as long as
[14:03:06] this red color still lingers I have a
[14:03:09] chance to fulfill that
[14:03:11] promise it represents a burning fire a
[14:03:15] blooming flower the berries in this cave
[14:03:19] and life itself fleeting yet still
[14:03:25] dazzling in the end it will lead me
[14:03:28] Beyond the Horizon of
[14:03:30] existence and on the other side
[14:03:34] I
[14:03:35] will cut off
[14:03:39] nil the one blessed by the sleeping and
[14:03:43] shapeless is considering how to kill
[14:03:47] them that's
[14:03:49] truly pure
[14:03:52] nihility but you're right about one
[14:03:55] thing after spending so much time thanks
[14:03:58] for the long stream you're a great
[14:03:59] streamer thank
[14:04:01] you 10 hour stream I look at this
[14:04:04] vibrant red
[14:04:07] fire do I realize
[14:04:11] that when will this
[14:04:13] rain ever stop
[14:04:17] perhaps I wait for the Departed of The
[14:04:20] Departed have finally quieted
[14:04:24] down the sky will clear
[14:04:27] up I do weep for them four four hours
[14:04:37] have you heard of a planet named barari
[14:04:40] skandros Don hung it's one of the
[14:04:44] paradise kingdoms under the influence of
[14:04:46] the
[14:04:47] harmony a sought after Wonderland for
[14:04:50] the inhabitants of the dardu major and
[14:04:53] minor
[14:04:55] systems half an Amber era ago the family
[14:04:58] held an unprecedented Festival
[14:05:01] there and after that that everyone on
[14:05:05] the planet if you could use like a the
[14:05:08] family do you think the same thing will
[14:05:10] happen on penone yes like a pet or how
[14:05:14] else can we explain
[14:05:16] it the family deliberately used the
[14:05:20] watch Maker's invitation to keep all the
[14:05:22] path Striders here but banished the
[14:05:25] emanator of the nihility because of the
[14:05:28] nihility I'm rarely affected by the
[14:05:30] power of other paths but somehow I can
[14:05:33] unconsciously infiltrate
[14:05:36] them maybe that's the risk they're
[14:05:38] trying to
[14:05:39] avoid I would
[14:05:41] disagree barari skandros is not part of
[14:05:44] the credit system or connected to the
[14:05:46] silver rail it's nothing more than a
[14:05:49] remote civilization sheltered by the
[14:05:51] harmony if the family messes with
[14:05:54] penacon that would be like declaring war
[14:05:56] on almost half of the factions in the
[14:05:58] cosmos no they
[14:06:01] don't if they truly serve the harmony
[14:06:04] that is what do you mean the path in
[14:06:07] paniconi is
[14:06:08] impure the harmony here has
[14:06:12] impurities do you remember the ancient
[14:06:15] swarm disaster I
[14:06:17] do taser the propagation brought endless
[14:06:21] Havoc to the
[14:06:22] universe and it eventually why do I hear
[14:06:25] someone walking to the left fierce
[14:06:26] battle among all
[14:06:30] eons the [ __ ] is happening it's pom
[14:06:35] okay sorry two paths lost their eons in
[14:06:38] that war the propagation and the
[14:06:42] order coincidentally their downfall is
[14:06:46] related to a certain Eon sheipe the
[14:06:50] harmony Legend has it that they
[14:06:52] participated in the Crusade against the
[14:06:54] imperator insectorum and devoured Anna
[14:06:57] the order for unknown
[14:06:59] reasons holy
[14:07:02] forgeron so you're saying that the two
[14:07:05] paths are working behind the scenes but
[14:07:08] I don't see any descendants of the
[14:07:10] propagation in
[14:07:11] pentacon could it be that the remnants
[14:07:14] of beyond the sky choir are hiding
[14:07:17] within the family trying to resurrect a
[14:07:21] fallen Eon I can't say for sure but
[14:07:24] they're definitely planning something
[14:07:26] for the Char resurrect an eon
[14:07:30] holy this is getting way too complicated
[14:07:33] is this what why you want us to leave
[14:07:34] asna right away are you giving up the
[14:07:36] Charmy Festival will start soon bu talks
[14:07:39] fast one thing that I need to confirm no
[14:07:42] matter what a warp jump is the best way
[14:07:45] to do
[14:07:46] so time is running out I have another
[14:07:54] plan hold on are you thinking of using
[14:07:59] the Jade Abacus of allying oath exactly
[14:08:03] the assistance from the lau Cloud
[14:08:05] Knights would be enough think it over
[14:08:10] carefully you can only use that once in
[14:08:13] your lifetime I have considered it
[14:08:16] thoroughly my companions
[14:08:19] are they're also once in a lifetime
[14:08:22] Treasures

[14:09:13] she was supposed to be the star of the
[14:09:16] Charmy Festival in our
[14:09:21] plan but the plan has changed as her
[14:09:24] brother I I know she doesn't want to
[14:09:27] sing for the order so I'll take her
[14:09:31] place h
[14:09:33] you've always been wise beyond your
[14:09:37] years I'm sure you understand the
[14:09:40] consequences of your
[14:09:45] choice if you consider this a
[14:09:48] betrayal well there can't be two sons in
[14:09:51] the sky I'll step up and take down the
[14:09:54] other son if necessary

[14:10:27] your
[14:10:29] wish well the compromise came sooner

[14:10:33] expected why you and your sister were
[14:10:37] born as twins of the
[14:10:40] order and one of you is destined to
[14:10:43] follow this path to the
[14:10:49] end is this part of your plan of
[14:10:54] course you're still as clever as you
[14:10:57] were when you were a child the opening
[14:11:00] is
[14:11:01] near go my child sees the Power of the
[14:11:07] Harmony and I have one final Question
[14:11:10] Master why did you choose to bring the
[14:11:13] order to
[14:11:14] penacon wouldn't it have been better to
[14:11:16] choose a desperate World instead of a
[14:11:19] city filled with Hope and
[14:11:22] Dreams
[14:11:23] why it's for justice my
[14:11:27] child if we lose Justice in our hearts
[14:11:31] we will make the same mistake stake as
[14:11:34] the harmony

[14:17:44] clash with my esteemed guests from

[14:17:55] irreparable where shall we start oh

[14:18:16] when penone was still a
[14:18:24] frontier the [ __ ]
[14:18:27] [Music]
[14:18:36] sorry in 2147 AE a prisoner named hanun
[14:18:42] ignited a struggle for and emerged
[14:18:45] triumphant IPC to it as the war of the

[14:19:50] land of freedom on a scorched Earth as
[14:19:54] you can see their sentences have long
[14:19:57] ended and the IPC guards have long been
[14:20:00] expelled yet these prisoners remain

[14:20:07] the confines of their own
[14:20:10] minds thank you for your hard work

[14:39:13] this my dear weird bro it's in the game
[14:39:16] what do you want from
[14:39:18] me
[14:39:20] nevertheless this is but a trivial blip
[14:39:22] in the annals of Galactic
[14:39:24] history what truly matters is the course
[14:39:28] this River shall take in the days to
[14:39:30] come you've arrived at the perfect
[14:39:33] moment the charmony festival is about to
[14:39:36] commence and it would be a shame if you
[14:39:38] were absent for the Harmony's prologue
[14:39:42] allow me to extend my warmest if Bo Hill
[14:39:45] was here boom one shot one kill Sunday's
[14:39:48] dead Quest over 10 hours ago the very
[14:39:50] core of ab the ab of the stellon the
[14:39:54] grand stage of the charmony
[14:39:58] festival and the Very a place where the
[14:40:02] future of penacon shall be determined uh
[14:40:06] yeah KY you probably don't need both
[14:40:07] Boot and Firefly but if you if you like
[14:40:09] both of them I'm sure that's fine like
[14:40:11] your account's not ruined cuz you want
[14:40:12] two DPSS you could just interchange it's
[14:40:15] fine very place where your schemes get
[14:40:17] smashed to
[14:40:19] [Music]
[14:40:22] Smither your unwavering faith in the
[14:40:25] trailblaze is truly
[14:40:27] impressive true goodness can only be
[14:40:30] achieved through
[14:40:33] faith allow me to point out that falling
[14:40:35] into a permanent Slumber is not
[14:40:38] happiness especially when those people
[14:40:40] are driven by someone else's will in
[14:40:42] their
[14:40:44] sleep do you still believe that the
[14:40:46] order only seeks to control the universe
[14:40:48] as their puppet
[14:40:50] heo no matter how perfect your vision of
[14:40:53] paradise may be a cage oh my God it's
[14:40:56] the bird analogy
[14:40:59] again people will never never achiev
[14:41:01] true happiness in a world like that they
[14:41:04] would just be toys for the Eon okay
[14:41:06] which Eon though March cuz I've seen
[14:41:08] some of them it seems you have
[14:41:11] misunderstood my
[14:41:13] intentions allow me to
[14:41:16] clarify my desire is not to resurrect a
[14:41:19] fallen Eon or become one
[14:41:25] myself my sole objective is to create a
[14:41:28] paradise free from eons where the order
[14:41:31] ensures the dignity and happiness of all
[14:41:34] Humanity a paradise exclusive to us
[14:41:38] human
[14:41:39] beings that's not the case if people are
[14:41:42] to live with dignity there must be
[14:41:45] nothing and no one above
[14:41:47] them in your so-called Paradise you
[14:41:50] would be the one reigning
[14:41:54] Supreme looks like we won't be able to
[14:41:57] convince each other now that our
[14:41:59] conflict has been destined
[14:42:01] let's unveil our paths and reveal to the
[14:42:04] universe the true path order however
[14:42:09] before the Prelude to the Future begins
[14:42:12] wait we're still in the Prelude take a

[14:54:44] either uh what's going
[14:54:47] on fck forget about it if it slipped all
[14:54:52] our minds reckon that person was just a
[14:54:54] minor scoundrel
[14:54:57] unimportant yes when the dust set
[14:55:01] I'll just think of a way to recall it in
[14:55:03] the memory Zone everyone let's hurry up
[14:55:06] and look for Miss himo shall
[14:55:09] we she's now a minor star on paniconi
[14:55:13] and the entire hotel is concerned about
[14:55:15] her well-being you're
[14:55:18] right this music is like goofy but
[14:55:20] ominous I feel like something just about

[14:55:27] okay Robo ball fan okay
[14:55:31] what the [ __ ] J they're with the
[14:55:34] general that's all right in these times
[14:55:37] of conflict for the sake of utmost
[14:55:39] safety it is only right that the
[14:55:41] alliance steps forward to mediate on
[14:55:43] behalf of the Astro Express we must not
[14:55:46] allow you to take unnecessary risks Yad
[14:55:50] our
[14:55:52] general furthermore despite the ipc's
[14:55:56] eagerness for Success it prioritizes
[14:55:59] peace above of all and the family
[14:56:02] trapped though it may be professes a
[14:56:04] desire for harmony the alliance has
[14:56:08] always want people over with reason I
[14:56:11] firmly believe both parties can indeed
[14:56:13] put aside their differences and come to
[14:56:15] a peaceful agreement the general
[14:56:18] possesses a deep understanding of the
[14:56:20] greater good you flatter me but
[14:56:23] ultimately it's been all down to the
[14:56:25] express well would you look at that here
[14:56:29] comes the Big Hero
[14:56:31] that's
[14:56:33] me let me guess you were thinking about
[14:56:35] me if it isn't the galactic face baller
[14:56:39] a hero with unparalleled Insight are you
[14:56:42] okay I heard you couldn't wake up are
[14:56:45] you feeling
[14:56:46] unwell don't worry Mr Yang there's
[14:56:49] nothing wrong with her she practically
[14:56:51] burned through a lifetime's worth of
[14:56:53] jokes on the way here what about you Mr
[14:56:56] Yang I heard that even miss Robin wasn't
[14:56:59] spared and that guy locked you both up
[14:57:03] it's a long story but at least Mr Sunday
[14:57:08] from YouTube hi he used an ability
[14:57:11] called to connect our consciousnesses
[14:57:14] with his in other words he imprisoned us
[14:57:18] within his Consciousness thanks to
[14:57:20] General Jin yuen's destruction of the
[14:57:23] harmonious choir we were able to escape
[14:57:27] he used that tuning on us to I can
[14:57:29] confidently say now he was truly after a
[14:57:32] fair fight with us had he wanted he
[14:57:36] could have easily taken us
[14:57:38] down speaking of the oak family head
[14:57:42] where is he
[14:57:43] now it's complicated but in a
[14:57:46] nutshell he's now the former Oak family
[14:57:50] head huh the IPC has named him the key
[14:57:53] figure in the family's pentacon split
[14:57:56] citing a threat to Cosmic peace he must
[14:57:59] represent present the family an answer
[14:58:02] for the unrest caused huh his trial is
[14:58:05] set to take place at the family quickly
[14:58:07] labeled him and the remnants of the
[14:58:09] order as enemies declaring the turmoil
[14:58:12] and internal Rebellion everyone really
[14:58:14] has their own agenda after all then
[14:58:18] what's going to happen to miss R I can't
[14:58:20] tell if I'm just overleveled like over
[14:58:21] geared cuz it didn't it felt like the
[14:58:23] boss fight wasn't done like I feel like
[14:58:25] usually they're harder than that I just
[14:58:27] like boom and then they died the [ __ ]
[14:58:29] mobs before Sunday we're harder girl
[14:58:32] hello it's time
[14:58:34] everyone the ipc's key members and I
[14:58:37] have agreed to consult one another
[14:58:38] before given the General's invitation
[14:58:40] and the Matter's significance to the
[14:58:42] universe the crew will naturally
[14:58:45] accept however if the IPC has any
[14:58:48] reservation why of course you're welcome
[14:58:51] they've mentioned that your team is a
[14:58:53] trusted Ally besides if there can be
[14:58:56] reliable observers from the astral
[14:58:58] Express present discussion will go more
[14:59:02] smoothly I'm kind of allergic to those
[14:59:04] types of
[14:59:06] situations not to worry heo and I won't
[14:59:09] take care of things I'm afraid I'll also
[14:59:11] have to return to the express first the
[14:59:15] conductor is worried about us thank
[14:59:18] you what about
[14:59:20] you will you join welt and me yep
[14:59:23] Absolutely I'll go with Miss himo I have
[14:59:25] to help March Packer suitcase don't know
[14:59:27] why but something tells me I only have
[14:59:28] one option here
[14:59:31] great although I'm not too sure of the
[14:59:34] reason the representatives from the IPC
[14:59:36] have insisted on her presence allow me
[14:59:39] to lead the way follow me
[14:59:42] please the negotiation will commence at
[14:59:44] the hotel lobby everyone please follow
[14:59:50] me Mouse Stu Hine and Miss topaz are
[14:59:54] here too oh and who is that over
[14:59:57] there the intelligency Guild's Dr
[15:00:01] ratio this assembly is quite
[15:00:17] something it's been a while my astral
[15:00:21] Express friends missed you I would also
[15:00:24] extend my sincere thanks to you general
[15:00:26] of the law food I'm not halfway through
[15:00:28] we're almost done assures that the talks
[15:00:31] will likely reach a conclusion that
[15:00:32] satisfies all
[15:00:34] sides oh looks like everyone has come
[15:00:38] with expectations of course topaz if you
[15:00:42] please sure leave it to me in summary
[15:00:45] it's good news after much deliberation
[15:00:48] from the Strategic investment
[15:00:49] Department's Council the absolute
[15:00:52] majority of members have agreed to the
[15:00:54] following resolutions in light of
[15:00:56] long-term considerations for interal
[15:00:59] peace and by Authority sorry I
[15:01:02] misclicked now that's something doesn't
[15:01:05] that mean eventually took a hit for
[15:01:08] nothing uh if that's what it takes to
[15:01:11] bring peace to the entire universe it's
[15:01:13] a price I'll gladly
[15:01:16] pay has the IPC finished sharing all its
[15:01:20] thoughts then it's on I forgot I turned
[15:01:22] music up I'm like why is it louder than
[15:01:24] him Guild much like the genius Society
[15:01:26] has taken a keen interest in the recent
[15:01:29] calamity in P ultimately both it's so L
[15:01:32] it sounds like like at the Oscars or
[15:01:34] like the game awards when they like wrap
[15:01:35] it up and they blast the music so the
[15:01:37] guy talking you can't he's like drowning
[15:01:38] in the
[15:01:39] sound the floor is yours for the final
[15:01:42] CER scrum organic life's unrelenting
[15:01:46] search to understand the realm of inner
[15:01:49] spirituality is something I both admire
[15:01:52] and envy inorganic life has no mechanism
[15:01:56] to what are you talking about but when
[15:01:58] my mechanical impulse pulses are
[15:02:00] activated my inspiration circuits will
[15:02:02] start to operate and I will enter a
[15:02:05] state defined every time within the
[15:02:08] realm of imagination they alas they are
[15:02:11] after deliberation not only that we've
[15:02:14] also established contact with the garden
[15:02:16] of recollection through the IPC and
[15:02:19] they've pledged their support for our
[15:02:21] research Endeavors I'm truly happy for
[15:02:23] the Dreamchasers on pentacon the
[15:02:25] cosmos's brightest and let's admit
[15:02:29] dimmer
[15:02:30] wa that's [ __ ] up it's a big
[15:02:36] double it's only a matter of time till
[15:02:38] stal says G okay I'm just warning you
[15:02:41] guys also I thought Sunday was the
[15:02:43] classist one I realized it's it's
[15:02:45] probably ratio it's between ratio and
[15:02:47] aoto now it's a big W for everyone
[15:02:52] but never mind at the end of the day
[15:02:55] this is a positive outcome
[15:03:01] no wonder everyone insisted that she'd
[15:03:03] be there it heartens me to learn that
[15:03:05] everyone is willing to put aside their
[15:03:07] differences for penton's
[15:03:09] plight I trust that everyone will surely
[15:03:12] reach consensus in the upcoming
[15:03:14] negotiations looks like penton's future
[15:03:16] is
[15:03:18] decided I'm one peace is our greatest
[15:03:20] wish piss beyond that we desire nothing
[15:03:25] else well that's good now that
[15:03:28] everyone's Minds already

[15:03:39] more if that's the case it appears that
[15:03:43] we have nothing else to worry about on
[15:03:45] pentacon sounds good to me I feel like
[15:03:48] un I was like maybe because the music
[15:03:50] was so loud it felt like there's a
[15:03:52] second phase coming I feel like unhappy

[15:05:40] temporarily travel with the express for
[15:05:42] their own personal
[15:05:45] reasons as you all may know the astral
[15:05:48] Express never declines any passenger

[15:06:36] pom would have never known where
[15:06:38] M what they had to go through was
[15:06:41] regrettable but I reckon they all

[15:06:45] to the Crux of this navigation meeting
[15:06:48] the first choice is from himo the
[15:06:50] oceanic planet of laka a planet composed
[15:06:53] entirely of white wa Ki many aquatic

[15:06:59] the planet of the
[15:07:02] venerable the second choice is the agot
[15:07:05] world melanin suggested by welt
[15:07:08] melatonin named as one of the initial
[15:07:10] sites of the stellon disaster and the

[15:07:44] and then we'll put it to a vote laka
[15:07:47] little Misha and old Mel's Homeland
[15:07:50] having been through so much in pentacon
[15:07:52] as an aspiring nameless I believe a
[15:07:55] visit to his home world is a
[15:07:57] must Count Me In still I imagine that
[15:08:01] planet must have changed entirely after
[15:08:04] the stellon disaster I've heard that its
[15:08:07] land masses no longer exist and the
[15:08:09] native population has completely changed
[15:08:12] H I'm not against Miss heimo's choice
[15:08:16] but ostar sounds like it's in danger
[15:08:19] nope remember when Robin went to help a
[15:08:21] place in danger and got shot yeah I
[15:08:22] remember let's not do that which is
[15:08:24] right though the fact that the distress
[15:08:26] signals have ceased means we're probably
[15:08:28] too late
[15:08:30] but I still think we should investigate
[15:08:32] the situation there three votes for laka
[15:08:36] looks like we have a winner next up laka
[15:08:40] the ocean planet wait really is this
[15:08:42] scripted or this navigation meeting is
[15:08:44] adjourned I mean I know we're going back
[15:08:46] I mean I saw I'm not dumb like I saw the
[15:08:49] the new San Jo characters so I know
[15:08:50] we're not going there now but like maybe
[15:08:52] we're actually going there next it's
[15:08:53] time to make the jump pom pom will make
[15:08:55] an announcement there's still some time
[15:08:58] before the jump
[15:09:00] what should I
[15:09:05] do how about a chat over
[15:09:11] here oh you're here seeing your
[15:09:15] reflection Among the Stars in the port
[15:09:19] hole really does seem somewhat
[15:09:23] surreal how about it this journey of
[15:09:27] beautiful dreams
[15:09:29] was it to your
[15:09:31] liking what a roller coaster ride it's
[15:09:33] just so Peak keep it coming it kind of
[15:09:35] left me running more you know seems like
[15:09:37] there's still a lot of loose ends no
[15:09:38] it's why did they have the valerin a in
[15:09:40] here it's sort of a deuce X Machina when
[15:09:42] the next survey comes I'll be checking
[15:09:44] the too easy box
[15:09:46] [Music]
[15:09:51] again there's a rich scent of curiosity
[15:09:55] here such memories can be irresist ibly
[15:10:00] captivating so how about you hand that
[15:10:04] small Parting Gift back to
[15:10:07] me what was the small par gift to have
[15:10:10] it
[15:10:11] back
[15:10:13] oh oh
[15:10:16] okay oh
[15:10:21] oh never mind I just stumbled upon a
[15:10:26] particularly fascinating spot in your
[15:10:28] memory uh-oh before I explain I would
[15:10:32] like to apologize to
[15:10:34] you this farewell gift I gave you isn't
[15:10:37] really a compass from the memory Zone
[15:10:40] but merely an empty light her voice is
[15:10:43] nice dud I feel like black sw's like a
[15:10:45] Asm youber in the Dreamscape for the
[15:10:47] first time and I procured a few trinkets
[15:10:51] from your
[15:10:52] companions their functions are
[15:10:56] similar this way I can always be be
[15:10:59] attuned to your location ready to assist
[15:11:02] immediately if you encounter any threats
[15:11:05] but this is not its most intrinsic
[15:11:09] function light cones are slices of light
[15:11:12] used to encapsulate solidified phenomena
[15:11:15] this empty light cone is the same it can
[15:11:19] etch your memories in their most Vivid
[15:11:22] form and
[15:11:23] then allow me to admire and manipulate
[15:11:27] them turning them into unique
[15:11:31] momentos all the world is born from the
[15:11:34] power of mind and soul and that power is
[15:11:38] memory to prevent ourselves from being
[15:11:41] forgotten by the world we must make the
[15:11:43] world remember
[15:11:45] us or use our memories to recreate it so
[15:11:50] do you want to make new memories
[15:11:51] together I'm sorry I'm sorry life
[15:11:55] seemingly vast offers but a scant
[15:11:57] collection of impa ful
[15:12:00] memories some joyful some sorrowful some
[15:12:05] light some heavy but you are different
[15:12:10] memory is a reflection of the future
[15:12:13] within that reflection I see your
[15:12:16] unparalleled
[15:12:18] worth you have the power to craft
[15:12:21] memories that can Captivate the world
[15:12:25] your memory why did fate make me laugh
[15:12:27] again universe's future path
[15:12:30] and that memory will be as scintilating
[15:12:33] as the star clusters you see in this
[15:12:36] portal you're making me
[15:12:39] blush how adorable uhoh but do you know
[15:12:43] the deeper meaning behind
[15:12:46] it the reason is simple in this
[15:12:50] grandiose and ostentatious dream of the
[15:12:53] families only you personally experienced
[15:12:57] the entire course stop speaking in
[15:13:01] riddles patience my friend friend I will
[15:13:05] reveal the answer to you but that time
[15:13:08] is not now turn around and take a look
[15:13:11] at your
[15:13:13] friends every one of them is reveling at
[15:13:16] the arrival of their next destination
[15:13:19] all filled with hopes and expectations
[15:13:22] of their own present and
[15:13:25] future revealing everything at this
[15:13:28] moment would be be a bit of a buzz kill
[15:13:31] does she know that I weave for The
[15:13:32] Departed I'm looking for an opportune
[15:13:36] time a time when you're totally at
[15:13:40] ease perhaps when the night grows hazy

[15:13:46] the most opportune how about one fine

[15:14:25] more to do in Pentagon there waiting for

[15:14:37] cone I will gift you with some words
[15:14:40] life is akin to a winding Labyrinth

[15:14:49] companions you'll remember these words
[15:14:52] dearly won't you in the year
[15:14:56] 2158 of the Amber era
[15:14:59] the first year of the new
[15:15:02] Epoch the universe resumed its intended
[15:15:07] trajectory the kindling of conspiracy
[15:15:10] smoldered in penacon the land of the
[15:15:15] dreams failing to erupt into a blaze it
[15:15:19] instead flickered briefly on kipo's
[15:15:23] Anvil before Vanishing in the blink of
[15:15:27] an eye
[15:15:29] the dead and those faded to die remain
[15:15:33] in their Eternal
[15:15:35] Slumber while the living find solace in
[15:15:38] deep
[15:15:40] Sleep all clamored in a cacophony of
[15:15:44] silence and then went about their own
[15:15:48] ways the cosmos emanated A Vitality
[15:15:51] characteristic of a new
[15:15:54] era all for the modest price of a
[15:15:57] brother and sisters mild
[15:16:00] grief babies are born as stars
[15:16:05] extinguish the silver rail
[15:16:08] unfolds the story of the astral Express
[15:16:12] comes to a close yet it also embarks a
[15:16:17] new Time Marches forward heralding the
[15:16:21] arrival of a new chapter in the history
[15:16:24] of trailblazing expeditions
[15:16:30] wait what the
[15:16:34] [ __ ] wait it's actually

[15:17:42] little bedtime story okay well let's
[15:17:47] start with a
[15:17:48] conclusion the crew was defeated in the
[15:17:51] battle against Sunday everyone in panone
[15:17:55] failed and no one survived huh
[15:18:01] but don't
[15:18:03] panic the truth as horrifying as it
[15:18:10] made1 there's still a glimmer of hope
[15:18:14] and that's why I'm
[15:18:17] here next I'll use this empty light conb
[15:18:21] that carries all your memories to relive
[15:18:23] everything that happened
[15:18:26] before and when this story reaches its
[15:18:29] end I'm sure someone as clever as you
[15:18:33] will notice
[15:18:35] that there's a major flaw in the story
[15:18:38] you have
[15:18:39] experienced yet within that flaw lies a
[15:18:43] glimmer of
[15:18:45] hope are you ready for it
[15:18:49] yes do you remember
[15:18:52] everything when the clock turned back
[15:18:55] the express started a warp jump sending
[15:18:57] you to a strange
[15:18:59] dream you were bewildered back then and
[15:19:03] then a galaxy ranger named acaron showed
[15:19:06] you away
[15:19:08] out when you arrived at the Ry Hotel you
[15:19:11] met the doorman Misha bro this was like
[15:19:13] two months ago with a an IPC
[15:19:19] representative thankfully Aaron appeared
[15:19:22] again and helped
[15:19:24] you after that you saved Firefly and
[15:19:28] explored pentacon I remember this my
[15:19:30] goat during the tour you ran into
[15:19:33] Sparkle disguised as sampo and
[15:19:35] accidentally entered a child
[15:19:39] stream yeah I remember there I rescued
[15:19:42] both of you from death but Firefly
[15:19:44] didn't return to
[15:19:46] reality she realized the truth and tried
[15:19:50] to involve you in her plan but that
[15:19:52] resulted in an accidental
[15:19:56] death even more unsettling you soon
[15:19:59] encountered another
[15:20:02] murder the two cases of death prompted
[15:20:05] you to investigate the truth behind the
[15:20:08] sweet
[15:20:09] dream despite your efforts to gather
[15:20:12] information about the two victims you
[15:20:14] didn't make much
[15:20:17] progress but you did learn about the
[15:20:19] watch maker from
[15:20:22] Gallagher meanwhile aventurine was
[15:20:25] secretly carrying out his scheme in
[15:20:27] which you were one of the
[15:20:30] ponds in the midst of a fierce battle
[15:20:33] acaron revealed her true identity as an
[15:20:36] emanator of the nil remember and unath
[15:20:39] her
[15:20:41] sword that strike foiled aventurine plan
[15:20:45] and opened a passage between the sweet
[15:20:47] dream and the original memory
[15:20:50] Zone upon your arrival at dreamlux Reef
[15:20:54] you learned the truth that death was
[15:20:57] actually dorcy
[15:20:59] as well as the truth about the
[15:21:01] Dreamscape the stellon and the Bellboy
[15:21:07] Misha you split up with Sunday and Robin
[15:21:10] looking for a way to seal the
[15:21:13] stellon however it turned out that
[15:21:16] Sunday and the dream master had their
[15:21:18] own hidden agenda okay and you had to
[15:21:22] engage in an ultimate duel on the stage
[15:21:25] where the [ __ ] is Robin now though
[15:21:29] finally the story reached its conclusion
[15:21:32] you emerged Victorious with the
[15:21:34] trailblaze triumphing over the order and
[15:21:37] pentacon embracing a bright and peaceful
[15:21:42] future this marks the end of the
[15:21:45] thrilling journey in
[15:21:47] panone I'm sure you've already noticed
[15:21:50] something
[15:21:51] unusual you remember when I told you
[15:21:53] that excuse my language but remember
[15:21:54] when I told you that all bad [ __ ]
[15:21:56] like believe in astrology look at look
[15:21:58] at her look at she's doing like torot
[15:21:59] cards and [ __ ] you just have to pretend
[15:22:01] you care I'm sorry it is what it is dude
[15:22:03] I'm telling you I told you I'm sorry you
[15:22:05] have dude like yes I'm I'm a Pisces
[15:22:08] Rising the major flaw which contradicts
[15:22:11] All the known information hides in this
[15:22:14] story major fla okay what the [ __ ] wait
[15:22:18] let me cook let me cook my first
[15:22:19] encounter with Misha at the hotel I was
[15:22:21] attacked by Sparkle disguised the sample
[15:22:23] the fake death of firefly and Robin Aron
[15:22:25] unsheathed her sword and revealed the
[15:22:27] power of nihility death is the disguise
[15:22:28] of
[15:22:30] dorcy okay I have a few it could be two
[15:22:33] things in my mind first of all could
[15:22:35] could Misha have escaped the bubble that
[15:22:36] early on maybe I don't think it's this
[15:22:39] no maybe this I think it's one or five
[15:22:42] but I could be I could be cooked I
[15:22:44] remember dormancy this dude was like
[15:22:45] dorance he's my pet but I don't remember
[15:22:46] who said that [ __ ] it it is true that
[15:22:49] Gallagher is a history
[15:22:52] fictionist but okay sorry this is not
[15:22:55] the sorry sorry I just didn't know what
[15:22:57] that was sorry I wanted to I want to use
[15:22:58] to talk to me maybe I clicked the wrong
[15:23:00] option on purpose so you talk to me I
[15:23:01] knew it was this one little I knew it I
[15:23:03] knew it was one I said it was one though
[15:23:04] or should I call him I knew it cuz
[15:23:06] there's no he escaped the bubble that
[15:23:07] early only a segment of memory in a
[15:23:09] dream bubble but his ambition for the
[15:23:12] trailblaze led him to leave the bubble
[15:23:15] and embark on a I just wanted to know
[15:23:17] who dorcy was please please please well
[15:23:20] Misha is no no no don't say Meme and he
[15:23:23] was granted Power by the trail
[15:23:26] plays there's still one one thing that
[15:23:29] he shouldn't be able to do a life born
[15:23:32] in the memory Zone man
[15:23:36] reality so why did he appear in the Ry
[15:23:40] hotel in
[15:23:41] reality the answer is
[15:23:45] simple he is the one fatal variable that
[15:23:49] contradicts all our known
[15:23:53] information this means that you who
[15:23:56] wholeheartedly believe in this memory
[15:23:59] are still trapped in the Dreamscape at
[15:24:04] this very
[15:24:10] moment
[15:24:17] huh oh that makes sense because he can't
[15:24:21] be in reality we have to be in the
[15:24:23] Dreamscape whenever we see
[15:24:25] Misha uh-oh beep
[15:24:29] it's [ __ ] the heat all over
[15:24:32] again Wake up sleepy head break free
[15:24:37] from this eternal dream and return to
[15:24:40] the real
[15:24:41] world we'll find our answers
[15:24:45] there wait what the [ __ ] is about to
[15:24:48] make the jump 5
[15:24:51] Four 3 2
[15:24:58] [Music]
[15:25:09] wait what the [ __ ] just

[15:25:47] second wait so hello we're back in 2.0
[15:25:51] I'm kind of glad there's more cuz if the
[15:25:53] quest ended there I would have felt a
[15:25:54] little
[15:25:56] empty thank you so so much Black
[15:26:01] Swan finally I can breathe a sigh of
[15:26:06] relief okay now that we're experiencing
[15:26:08] Peak I'm going to say something that's
[15:26:09] going to upset the lore fans I feel like
[15:26:11] Sunday like 1 hour of the quest where
[15:26:13] they're yapping about the bird over and
[15:26:14] over could have been avoided I'm sorry
[15:26:16] like I feel like one hour of my life is
[15:26:17] gone but everything else was good what
[15:26:19] happened what is this place the deja vu
[15:26:20] is strong with this
[15:26:24] scene I understand you must be confused
[15:26:27] and we'll do our best to shed light on
[15:26:29] the
[15:26:29] situation however before that it's
[15:26:32] essential to know
[15:26:34] that this place is the rift between
[15:26:37] dream and
[15:26:38] reality a place reserved only for those
[15:26:41] who have awakened from enna's dream okay
[15:26:44] do you remember Sunday's ambitious
[15:26:49] plan he intended to harness the power of
[15:26:52] the stellon the collective will of over
[15:26:55] 100,000 it was 107,000 336 actually 107
[15:27:00] 336 but it's okay you're the me you're
[15:27:01] the memory keeper you should know this
[15:27:03] but and restore the
[15:27:06] order unfortunately it didn't stop there
[15:27:09] from the early days of our journey into
[15:27:11] asdon we were already affected by the
[15:27:14] stellon that strange
[15:27:16] dreamx donated a sign that your
[15:27:20] literally you true yap yap
[15:27:22] yap what all this is just a dream did I
[15:27:25] fall asleep on the express I'm now back
[15:27:27] at the beginning of the story
[15:27:31] I don't think the goal of the order was
[15:27:34] to put everyone into a deep
[15:27:36] sleep quite the
[15:27:38] contrary they used the stellon to
[15:27:40] catalyze the leakage of a sorry st's
[15:27:44] Memoria into the material world allowing
[15:27:47] the Dreamscape to blend with reality and
[15:27:50] that included a lot of Memoria from the
[15:27:52] beyond the sky oh [ __ ] they're singing
[15:27:53] Memoria again I got a drink as time came
[15:27:55] and went the dreams did I miss any
[15:28:01] Memorial they became indistinguishable
[15:28:04] from reality and reality became an
[15:28:07] illusion people think they are awake but
[15:28:11] their Spirits have long since stepped
[15:28:13] into the Temple of
[15:28:14] order this is what makes Anna's dream so
[15:28:19] powerful in this paradise governed by
[15:28:22] the order everyone indulges in their
[15:28:24] delightful dreams and lives happily ever
[15:28:27] after I believe what you experienced in
[15:28:30] the sweet dream except for that flaw was
[15:28:35] real only in this way could you reach
[15:28:38] the destination lifting the crisis in
[15:28:41] pentacon and embarking on your next
[15:28:43] trailblazing Expedition if it wasn't for
[15:28:46] Aaron's plan we might have been trapped
[15:28:49] in this dream forever fortunately while
[15:28:52] the path of the order governs all things
[15:28:54] it can't affect the
[15:28:55] nihility I nil is broken
[15:28:58] Master tried to expel me at any cost
[15:29:01] this is also why you felt a sense of
[15:29:03] peculiarity when traveling with
[15:29:07] her well I'm not as fortunate as she is
[15:29:12] even if I'm a memo keeper I was still
[15:29:15] influenced by the power of the order and
[15:29:17] fell into
[15:29:19] hallucinations however thanks to your
[15:29:22] memories now we still have a chance to
[15:29:25] turn the tide
[15:29:28] for Mortals even if they possess the
[15:29:30] great power of a path they can't create
[15:29:33] a Flawless world like gods do that's why
[15:29:36] there was a flaw in your dream in other
[15:29:39] words once you have realized the world
[15:29:41] is not real you'll have a chance to
[15:29:43] break free from the dream the flaw in
[15:29:46] your dream lies within Misha who could
[15:29:49] have never appeared in
[15:29:52] reality when I turned the pages of your
[15:29:55] memories I realized that I I was in an
[15:29:59] illusion too huh didn't expect it all
[15:30:02] comes back to Misha now Sunday has
[15:30:05] usurped the power of the harmonious
[15:30:07] choir through the Charmy
[15:30:09] Festival asdon has thus fallen into
[15:30:12] Anna's dream well fre everyone equally
[15:30:16] into the notes of the
[15:30:17] Eon oh POG standard I mean that's weapon
[15:30:22] PS failure doesn't mean
[15:30:25] weakness Only the Strong can get gather
[15:30:28] the will to resist the order and try to
[15:30:30] break
[15:30:31] free wa why are people saying to all to

[15:30:38] think everyone gets it unless this guy
[15:30:40] just got lucky everyone got it okay we

[15:30:46] happen please Black Swan guide us to
[15:30:50] those with a strong
[15:30:54] will it was originally for 10 but they
[15:30:56] got flamed I see all right please come

[15:31:03] are they're the ones who accept and as
[15:31:06] dream and indulge in their happy
[15:31:09] Illusions we have no means to wake them
[15:31:11] up I just
[15:31:13] TP yes no not even your Clockwork will
[15:31:17] do the
[15:31:22] trick uh okay however there are still
[15:31:26] other things we can do let's keep
[15:31:30] going talk to an
[15:31:39] NPC you missed one Memorial like 3 to 4
[15:31:43] hours ago when gallaga was revealing
[15:31:45] watch maker resting place here we are oh

[15:32:05] mean by that me introduce you to Robin
[15:32:07] she woke up from Anna's dream by her own
[15:32:10] will and it's this tough lady who led us
[15:32:13] here with her
[15:32:16] song I woke up for the same reason as
[15:32:19] all of you in the dream I experienced
[15:32:22] something that could
[15:32:26] never what happened
[15:32:28] you say we going to lock it up you [ __ ]
[15:32:31] you [ __ ] I want to see it Fly freely in
[15:32:33] the
[15:32:35] [Music]
[15:32:37] sky without us this bird would be too
[15:32:40] fragile to survive on its
[15:32:43] own do you want it to
[15:32:45] die no
[15:32:48] but it's the same
[15:32:51] bird then let's take care of it together
[15:32:54] until it can return to the sky
[15:32:58] huh oh anomaly birds have wings because
[15:33:01] they're meant to fly anomaly even if
[15:33:04] they may crash on oh it's like Exit 8
[15:33:07] they shouldn't be we should play that
[15:33:11] game1 birds belong to the sky so we
[15:33:15] should help them oh they showed us the
[15:33:18] story 26 times cuz they're eventually
[15:33:20] going to anomaly it I get it okay so
[15:33:22] what about Sunday in the church okay
[15:33:24] sorry
[15:33:28] the illusion was so impossibly Blissful
[15:33:32] that I realized it was just a
[15:33:34] dream and this is our final hope enna
[15:33:38] dream is founded upon the harmonious
[15:33:40] choir namely everyone shared
[15:33:43] wishes it will only materialize once the
[15:33:47] aspirations of all beings in pentacon
[15:33:49] merge as
[15:33:50] one at present it has become impervious
[15:33:54] due to people's desire to remain
[15:33:56] slumbering within wait was it that a and
[15:33:59] in order to wait wait but wasn't that a
[15:34:01] memory so her anomaly was she had a
[15:34:03] memory that was wrong isn't that weird
[15:34:05] wait how if her memory of the birth
[15:34:07] story is wrong couldn't she just be like
[15:34:08] wait maybe I just had a bad memory like
[15:34:10] that's not something that happened
[15:34:11] wasn't that like 20 years ago how old is
[15:34:13] she like 20 that's like 20 years ago
[15:34:15] it's a lamp oh did did she like see the
[15:34:17] thing the dream was changing the memory
[15:34:20] yeah yeah yeah but like okay let's say I
[15:34:21] have a childhood memory and then like
[15:34:22] today I'm like I remember the memory a
[15:34:24] bit differently I wouldn't be like Oh
[15:34:25] I'm in a dream I would be like maybe I
[15:34:27] just misremembered this no but I guess I
[15:34:29] guess she knows Sunday's an [ __ ] so
[15:34:31] he wouldn't say that okay fair
[15:34:34] enough we must make everyone in penone
[15:34:37] want to wake
[15:34:39] up now comes the tricky part how do we
[15:34:43] do it just [ __ ] bring Boot Hill with
[15:34:46] a gun [ __ ] put a gun to their head
[15:34:47] they'll be like okay I'll wake up
[15:34:54] thoughts humans yearning for Sweet
[15:34:56] Illusions over way I just W upad them to
[15:35:01] subconsciously resist the harsh
[15:35:04] reality therefore I carefully selected a
[15:35:08] moment where she was completely
[15:35:10] unguarded guiding her to uncover the
[15:35:13] truth herself to make her regain her
[15:35:16] Consciousness however to wake up
[15:35:18] everyone in paniconi and get them to
[15:35:21] share the same
[15:35:23] determination that would be nearly
[15:35:26] impossible indeed
[15:35:28] I'm afraid it's almost as difficult as
[15:35:30] what if we just flash a sign that says
[15:35:32] you're in a dream wake up but we can't
[15:35:35] just stay here and do
[15:35:39] nothing like a big billboard this is a
[15:35:42] critical moment for the whole universe
[15:35:45] who cares about some dumb
[15:35:50] number thanks to Black
[15:35:53] Swan you're welcome and thanks to the
[15:35:57] memo Keepers in pentacon too I believe
[15:36:00] your partners have also awakened from
[15:36:04] their
[15:36:05] dreams this is the first step of our
[15:36:08] plan with the assistance from the garden
[15:36:10] of recollection those who possess a
[15:36:13] strong will like you will gradually
[15:36:15] awaken from the dream these free wills
[15:36:18] are the Discord that will sway Anna's
[15:36:22] dream however Awakening a mere handful
[15:36:25] of individuals is insignificant compared
[15:36:28] to the vast number of people immersed in
[15:36:30] the dream we must find other ways to
[15:36:33] awaken the Free Will of millions of
[15:36:35] people within a short period of time if
[15:36:38] breaking through from the inside proves
[15:36:40] challeng 11 a.m. we can seek assistance
[15:36:42] from the outside we've long been aware
[15:36:45] of a potential
[15:36:47] solution Asana is a galaxy known for its
[15:36:50] abundant Memoria and the remarkable
[15:36:52] phenomenon known as synesthesia
[15:36:54] Dreamscape when people first enter this
[15:36:57] place they often find themselves and
[15:36:59] others sharing a collective dream at
[15:37:02] this very moment there is only one dream
[15:37:05] encompassing the entire asdon system so
[15:37:09] you mean if we can attract a large
[15:37:12] number of Outsiders to this system their
[15:37:14] Free Will would intertwine with this
[15:37:17] dream and shake it to its core however
[15:37:20] those Outsiders might also succumb to
[15:37:23] the dream and become the foundation of
[15:37:25] the order instead
[15:37:28] the real challenge is how can we gather
[15:37:31] a huge number of people as determined as
[15:37:34] you within a short period of
[15:37:37] time looks like the Jade app kiss of no
[15:37:41] no need for that keep your wants a
[15:37:44] lifetime treasure we don't need to
[15:37:46] bother the Ceno wait okay no disrespect
[15:37:49] has booill done anything yet thousands
[15:37:51] of people with unwavering Free
[15:37:54] Will that's easy
[15:37:57] just leave it to us Galaxy Rangers you
[15:38:00] can gather Galaxy
[15:38:03] Rangers Outsiders may see Galaxy Rangers
[15:38:07] as Elusive and disconnected individuals
[15:38:11] and actually they're right and that's
[15:38:14] why we have a tcid understanding Among
[15:38:18] Us do you know what it is acaron a butt
[15:38:23] plug it's The Relic I returned to you
[15:38:26] exactly its owner must have told you
[15:38:29] that it's meaningless to anyone other
[15:38:32] than a galaxy ranger and that it can
[15:38:34] only fulfill its purpose when returned
[15:38:36] to its rightful owner because it's a
[15:38:40] burial
[15:38:41] artifact worthy
[15:38:43] only who has served the Galaxy with
[15:38:47] honor when it lad illuminates the
[15:38:49] universe it means the fall of a hero
[15:38:53] countless meteors will streak across the
[15:38:56] sky those meteors are Galaxy Rangers
[15:39:01] coming from all corners of the cosmos
[15:39:03] driven by a shared purpose without
[15:39:07] questioning the cause or counting the
[15:39:09] cost because we abide by a common
[15:39:12] principle what's the principle the
[15:39:14] shooting stars of the hunt only descend
[15:39:16] on the longest night and with them comes
[15:39:21] the dawn we've stayed silent for far too
[15:39:25] long now it's time to remind all the
[15:39:29] cowards oppressors and villains of the
[15:39:31] universe of our presence I'll be the one
[15:39:34] to ignite the first Spark D wait is
[15:39:38] about to be useful wait I'll complete
[15:39:41] the Second Step I'll fine tune the
[15:39:43] slumbering souls with the song of the
[15:39:45] harmony interrupting them with the
[15:39:47] Discord of trailblaze and guiding them
[15:39:50] towards
[15:39:51] reality it's true that some people are
[15:39:54] born strong and others are born weak
[15:39:58] if the trailblaze is the target of
[15:40:00] Heroes then the harmony will guarantee
[15:40:03] that the strong help the weak only the
[15:40:06] people of pentacon themselves can be the
[15:40:08] saviors of their their path of Happiness
[15:40:10] should be forged by
[15:40:12] themselves thanks Robin
[15:40:15] namess I'm willing to instill courage in
[15:40:18] all those who need it this includes my
[15:40:20] brother as
[15:40:22] well andna
[15:40:25] dream is too cruel for for him your plan
[15:40:28] sounds well conceived but still it
[15:40:31] appears somewhat idealistic and
[15:40:37] romantic the flaws rooted in human
[15:40:40] nature can't be eradicated
[15:40:43] overnight do you believe these efforts
[15:40:46] alone are enough to convince everyone to
[15:40:49] choose the right
[15:40:51] path I agree with you Black Swan that's
[15:40:54] why the most critical aspect of this
[15:40:56] plan is not to convince everyone to
[15:40:59] choose the right
[15:41:01] path but to inspire them to save
[15:41:05] themselves Inspire them to save
[15:41:07] themselves so you're the key in the end
[15:41:11] the harmonious choir possesses the power
[15:41:13] of an eminator to overcome it you'll
[15:41:16] need the same level of power the final
[15:41:20] step in destroying the sweet dream
[15:41:22] that's a relief to
[15:41:25] hear now that our roles are are
[15:41:27] assigned let's get to our Battlefield to
[15:41:30] impose a grand
[15:41:34] finale May I have a moment alone with
[15:41:38] you yes one more thing I need to explain
[15:41:40] to
[15:41:42] you this grand festival is drawing to
[15:41:45] its
[15:41:46] close this is the starting point for the
[15:41:48] ultimate stage of our
[15:41:50] journey just as it marked the beginning
[15:41:52] of all the stories in pentacon
[15:42:08] only by reflecting on our steps can we
[15:42:10] remember the path we should be walking
[15:42:12] on and the companions who have walked
[15:42:15] alongside
[15:42:17] us there's something you should know we
[15:42:20] were able to locate you within this
[15:42:22] boundless dream and find the key to
[15:42:25] Breaking Free from the dream
[15:42:27] all because of one person's unwavering
[15:42:31] dedication
[15:42:32] Firefly
[15:42:34] Firefly she awakened from the dream
[15:42:37] ahead watched discovered the express
[15:42:39] amidst the stars and brought us valuable
[15:42:42] information about the remnants of the
[15:42:44] order she may have been aided by the
[15:42:47] script and it came at a
[15:42:51] cost as you know Firefly is a stowaway
[15:42:56] who entered the Dreamscape in a
[15:42:57] different way from
[15:42:59] ours without the dream po or assistance
[15:43:03] from the
[15:43:04] family she can only awaken from this
[15:43:06] dream in one
[15:43:08] way a real death
[15:43:12] oh we mustn't fail her
[15:43:16] determination I'm not implying that we
[15:43:18] must win this fight no matter what but
[15:43:20] our resolve should match that of that
[15:43:22] courageous
[15:43:24] lady are you ready
[15:43:27] [Music]

[15:43:56] easy I see I was saying I was like that
[15:43:59] can't be the end of the boss fight it
[15:44:00] felt so like
[15:44:02] unsatisfying team must include lament
[15:44:05] play lore
[15:44:07] relevant okay I mean this seems kind of
[15:44:10] [ __ ] Tick Tock team okay I'm still going

[15:44:40] if I remember
[15:44:42] correctly it has lasted for decades or
[15:44:45] even centuries the unwavering
[15:44:48] determination of the hunt followers
[15:44:50] persists even in death plus if I die
[15:44:52] it'll be funnier but
[15:44:54] thankfully we've guided those lost souls
[15:44:57] to their lives
[15:44:58] beyond they were heroes in their
[15:45:02] time and they won't be reduced to
[15:45:04] puppets of the nil and their death you
[15:45:07] see the Shadows on the sea have

[15:46:21] creates countless ripples or a bug bite
[15:46:24] I don't
[15:46:25] know thesei
[15:46:27] last longer than the fleeting lifetimes
[15:46:29] of
[15:46:30] humans and for
[15:46:32] some their presence leaves such a strong
[15:46:35] Mark that it's reflected in the waves
[15:46:38] weing waves sin
[15:46:40] thers the obsessions of the path
[15:46:44] Striders they emerge from the depths of
[15:46:46] aex seeing themselves as masters of
[15:46:49] their own destiny unknowingly repeating
[15:46:52] the actions of their past lives yeah the
[15:46:55] hands got closer looks like black swal
[15:46:57] they emerge from the nil and head toward
[15:47:00] it leading purposeless

[15:51:54] tuned please stay tuned
[15:51:57] always distinguished between reality and
[15:52:00] Imagination all right gray life is akin
[15:52:05] to a winding Labyrinth where memories
[15:52:08] serve as our soul may your schemes be
[15:52:12] forever
[15:52:14] concealed Anna's dream is too cool for
[15:52:18] to the imperfect tomorrow please
[15:52:22] St I still remember the question on the
[15:52:26] in ation
[15:52:29] letter why does life
[15:52:36] Slumber why does life
[15:52:39] Slumber we don't know the answer yet but
[15:52:43] we're about to awaken from this stream
[15:52:46] someone answered that earlier such is
[15:52:48] the there dialog like why does life
[15:52:50] Slumber and then she said it leave this
[15:52:52] place return to where you belong and
[15:52:57] awaken paniconi from this dream will you
[15:53:00] come with us what if folks don't want to
[15:53:02] wake up will I get to witness your
[15:53:03] hidden Powers as I said our plan is not
[15:53:07] about convincing everyone to choose the
[15:53:09] right path but about inspiring them to
[15:53:13] save
[15:53:14] themselves so when will people actively
[15:53:19] save themselves the answer
[15:53:21] is when they are in Desperate situations
[15:53:25] like a drowning in individual in the
[15:53:27] deep sea yeah that's why I said get Boot
[15:53:30] Hill to [ __ ] whip his gun out on
[15:53:32] everyone oh [ __ ] wake up [ __ ] oh
[15:53:36] [ __ ] hey Z thanks for the raid I firmly
[15:53:39] believe I know you streamed and ended
[15:53:41] before I ended mine 666 raid uh-oh I saw
[15:53:44] the Clocky puzzle okay dude it wasn't
[15:53:47] even that bad okay in my defense I'm
[15:53:49] really good at Clocky puzzles that one
[15:53:50] was the hardest one I've ever done the
[15:53:52] fragility of humankind often freezes
[15:53:55] them in their TR
[15:53:56] TRS but in truly desperate situations
[15:54:00] they will strive to save
[15:54:02] themselves and
[15:54:04] now paniconi has enough Heroes to lead
[15:54:07] them
[15:54:08] forward it's through this inherent
[15:54:12] self-centered Instinct that people exert
[15:54:15] their utmost effort even when they know
[15:54:19] their struggle is
[15:54:21] fruitless as absurd as it may seem it's
[15:54:25] their resistance does she not get cold
[15:54:27] she's like barely wearing a shirt I feel
[15:54:29] like I'd be cold I mean like I
[15:54:31] appreciate it but I feel like I'd be
[15:54:32] cold wait why would just twet it twice
[15:54:34] oh yeah see Temple
[15:54:40] any as for now it is time to guide them
[15:54:45] not as a savior but as a nameless among
[15:54:49] those
[15:54:50] Mortals in this
[15:54:53] way you will reunite and the war of the
[15:54:58] sunlight she barely feels things true
[15:55:00] the rain is wait does she have Co
[15:55:03] intensifying that's [ __ ] hope she's
[15:55:05] okay before we part with cuz she can't
[15:55:07] taste either right please allow me to
[15:55:09] ask a few final
[15:55:10] questions so far you have
[15:55:14] forged bonds with numerous individuals
[15:55:17] do you think Bill believes Co is real or
[15:55:19] no cuz he's kind of like yeaw I'm sorry
[15:55:22] background outfit is warm wait how okay
[15:55:24] sorry I got distracted so far you forge
[15:55:26] unbreakable bonds of newest individuals
[15:55:28] true might I ask if you fear severing
[15:55:32] these bonds with your own hands Bond I
[15:55:36] feel no fear wait what the
[15:55:44] hell if there is a vast lifelike
[15:55:47] Dreamland that is virtually
[15:55:49] indistinguishable from
[15:55:51] reality a realm without death where
[15:55:55] everyone can attain the the happiness
[15:55:57] and fulfillment they deserve living
[15:55:59] blissfully ever
[15:56:02] after I would
[15:56:04] ask would you wish to stay yes no I I
[15:56:08] mean no I mean if you're there gorgeous
[15:56:13] sorry imagine if this Splendid dream
[15:56:16] were faded to fall
[15:56:18] apart friends family
[15:56:22] strangers followed by the gentle breeze
[15:56:25] soaring Birds the
[15:56:28] stars and ultimately
[15:56:33] yourself everyone and every face they
[15:56:37] remember the joy and the
[15:56:39] heartaches the vows sealed and those
[15:56:42] left
[15:56:44] here all will inevitably March towards a
[15:56:47] predetermined
[15:56:50] ending if you had grasped the Journey's
[15:56:52] finale right from its Inception I would
[15:56:55] have
[15:56:57] ask would you still embark on this
[15:56:59] journey yes because I got to meet you
[15:57:02] sorry yes because I'm a Trail Blazer I
[15:57:04] would always blaze a
[15:57:07] trail who up blazing the trail sorry I'm
[15:57:11] glad the answer itself doesn't
[15:57:14] matter what matters is that you've made
[15:57:17] a
[15:57:17] decision listen touch and
[15:57:22] Ponder and therein lies the sensation
[15:57:26] cherish it because that's what makes us
[15:57:30] exist such is the only answer humans can
[15:57:33] offer when facing the
[15:57:39] nihility if the nihility represents the
[15:57:41] Primal Fear of Life rendering any lofty
[15:57:45] convictions insignificant under their
[15:57:47] imposing
[15:57:49] Shadow then behind this
[15:57:52] Shadow there must exist the most fervent
[15:57:55] source of light in the
[15:57:57] [Music]
[15:58:01] world just as every life that edges
[15:58:04] closer to death fervently approaches the
[15:58:07] end of the
[15:58:08] nihility we must pursue that primordial
[15:58:14] light now to think that you exist in the
[15:58:20] nihility and you watch over others to
[15:58:23] depart it such a task is absurd
[15:58:26] and meaningless
[15:58:29] nevertheless someone had to do
[15:58:32] it as for the meaning you mentioned even
[15:58:35] if it's a meaningless
[15:58:37] task I've come this far haven't I even
[15:58:41] if the future in Forge may not even
[15:58:45] belong to you it may not belong to me
[15:58:48] but it definitely belongs to
[15:58:53] someone but hardships why is this music
[15:58:57] so
[15:58:58] sad in that
[15:59:00] case allow me to do something must do
[15:59:06] please tell me your
[15:59:11] name uhoh is she going to say something
[15:59:13] other than Aron my
[15:59:15] name Jonathan perhaps oh no mind she
[15:59:18] just moed existence will vanish in the
[15:59:22] next moment and nobody
[15:59:26] will remember this conversation or your
[15:59:31] answer but I
[15:59:33] [Music]
[15:59:35] believe that your name should be
[15:59:40] remembered and this
[15:59:43] universe will remember
[15:59:45] it as
[15:59:49] well for
[15:59:52] me some things are difficult to recall
[15:59:56] yet there are others this this makes
[15:59:57] sense cuz she said she guarded acaron
[15:59:59] River so maybe her name's not acaron and
[16:00:01] she was just like I guard the acaron
[16:00:03] river a creation of the past she's also
[16:00:06] slow dancing with the memory keeper so
[16:00:08] maybe she like told her something I
[16:00:09] don't know I remember that marks the
[16:00:12] start of my
[16:00:14] journey the origin of the vibrant red
[16:00:17] Hue in my
[16:00:19] life and the most fervent element amidst
[16:00:22] every
[16:00:23] Tempest that's my name the most fervent
[16:00:26] element admits every Tempest I mean
[16:00:28] electroch charges Hydro Electro is your
[16:00:30] name Electro I remember that marks the
[16:00:33] start of my
[16:00:36] journey
[16:00:40] Ryden may wait I could have told you
[16:00:43] this two patches
[16:00:47] ago so she is rid in May but who the
[16:00:49] [ __ ] is BOS and
[16:00:51] Mory sorry sorry BOS and Mory BOS and
[16:00:55] Mory basic basically means River of
[16:00:57] forgetfulness is Guardian in Chinese
[16:00:59] bosen Mori is another name which is a
[16:01:00] name for River in Underworld think of
[16:01:02] sticks River from Greek myth in Chinese
[16:01:04] myth when you die and cross the river as
[16:01:06] Soul old man gives you a special meal if
[16:01:08] you eat it you forget all your past
[16:01:09] memories her name means forget River
[16:01:11] protect so BOS and Mory basically means
[16:01:13] River of forgetfulness is
[16:01:17] Guardian
[16:01:21] huh okay R
[16:01:24] in whoa

[16:17:32] crying today you almost got me
[16:17:36] though in the first year of the AE
[16:17:41] 2158 a fiery conspiracy erupted in the
[16:17:45] land of the
[16:17:47] dreams but soon faded in chaos and
[16:17:51] destruction who the [ __ ] is talking
[16:17:54] Whispers carried the tale of those
[16:17:57] fateful 48 system
[16:17:59] hours when a sun teetered on the
[16:18:02] precipice of collapse a paradise stood
[16:18:06] on the brink of
[16:18:07] Destruction and a world was poised to
[16:18:10] surrender to its new
[16:18:12] master amidst it all a body decayed a
[16:18:17] pack of vultures gathered and a brother
[16:18:20] and sister were doomed for Eternal
[16:18:23] separation
[16:18:27] and so an eon succumbed to Slumber once
[16:18:32] more some celebrated this fall While
[16:18:36] others
[16:18:37] mourned among the insignificant
[16:18:40] Witnesses mere specks in the vast
[16:18:43] tapestry of the
[16:18:44] universe it was said that this time the
[16:18:48] Eon met their demise with dignity
[16:18:55] as the cosmos bathed in the radiance of
[16:18:58] a pure Dawn a tempestuous storm brooded
[16:19:02] on the horizon the chance of everything
[16:19:05] for the Amber Lord grw ever louder yet
[16:19:11] no matter how one contemplates
[16:19:14] it time inexorably swings kot's colossal
[16:19:19] hammer in Eternal Cycles n o and two the
[16:19:25] tale of the astral Express reaches both
[16:19:28] its conclusion and a new
[16:19:31] beginning Time Marches forward heralding
[16:19:35] the arrival of a new chapter in the
[16:19:38] history of trailblazing
[16:19:48] expeditions wait that
[16:19:51] was PE brother do you think
[16:19:55] the Stars will fade away where did that
[16:19:58] come all of a sudden what's them because
[16:20:01] the constellation that looks like a bird
[16:20:03] stop with the bird toret
[16:20:06] Eagles looks a bit dim
[16:20:10] lately it's the torment Eagles don't
[16:20:13] worry it's still there it's just it's
[16:20:16] located in the inner ring of pentacon
[16:20:18] and can only be seen when spring and
[16:20:20] summer overlap as for the question you
[16:20:23] asked I think stars do die just like
[16:20:27] people but do you know sister no star
[16:20:31] actually belongs to the present the
[16:20:34] light we see from them is from a long
[16:20:36] time ago even after the Stars perished
[16:20:40] their light will travel millions of
[16:20:42] light years spanning count me after I
[16:20:44] watch one kneel the grass Tyson short
[16:20:46] Sky of another world in our Paradise I
[16:20:51] believe there will be a star like that
[16:20:54] shining with the same
[16:20:56] light its Radiance will last forever and
[16:21:00] its name will be happiness happiness
[16:21:05] Robin no not just one star we should
[16:21:09] have two stars or maybe even more yeah
[16:21:13] you're right it's a deal it's a deal
[16:21:17] then this is our promise and nothing
[16:21:21] will sway our ideals
[16:21:25] nothing yeah what about order

[16:24:21] losing a Cornerstone is a hefty price to
[16:24:24] pay
[16:24:25] Diamond just called a meeting to discuss
[16:24:27] what to do with

[16:25:21] interesting but since it's Diamond's

[16:28:05] this one gave me similar Vibes of like
[16:28:06] people stuck in a dream instead of it
[16:28:08] being like araras and Nita it's like a
[16:28:10] bunch of H characters I liked it I'm
[16:28:12] also biased cuz I like Pen's aesthetic
[16:28:14] and I like the characters so even if it
[16:28:16] was pure dog [ __ ] it would at least
[16:28:17] start at like a three for me uh why is
[16:28:19] [ __ ] nummy over there I liked it I I
[16:28:22] would have been pissed if it ended where
[16:28:23] I thought it was going to end I'm glad
[16:28:25] that it didn't because I didn't feel
[16:28:26] satisfied and then they were like oh

[16:28:30] male who's dead I don't really get what
[16:28:32] happened to Gallagher he's just like
[16:28:33] drink and then it it cut I don't know if
[16:28:35] that implied that something happened or
[16:28:37] I don't know dead wait really is that
[16:28:40] what they implied oh well
[16:28:44] rip I wish we could play as other like
[16:28:46] older Misha though cuz he's a pretty
[16:28:48] cool character lorewise but he looks
[16:28:50] like a
[16:28:51] [ __ ] sorry check V visitor list on

[16:30:07] Jes anyways that Quest was [ __ ] Peak
[16:30:10] I get why you guys like it um I will say
[16:30:13] though it is jarring how long it is the
[16:30:15] first half I lowkey fell asleep a little
[16:30:18] I get that I was setting everything up
[16:30:19] if I had to hear about the bird one more
[16:30:21] time I would have flown off my [ __ ]
[16:30:24] building like the bird did but like the
[16:30:26] last like the last like the second half
[16:30:28] was insane I really liked it or Memoria
[16:30:31] dude I literally drank like 20 times

[16:30:41] kudos to Star rail I do wish that you
[16:30:44] could challenge this boss early without
[16:30:46] having the quest done I I get it that
[16:30:47] like you know you should do the quest
[16:30:48] but especially if it's like a 10-hour
[16:30:50] fight you don't want people to rush
[16:30:51] through it just to be able to do the
[16:30:52] boss I I get that it's like spoilers or
[16:30:54] whatever but like you don't want to feel
[16:30:55] to rush through a quest skipping
[16:30:57] everything just cuz they need the mat
[16:30:58] that's my opinion like well that's why
[16:30:59] genin has it too genin you could say

[16:42:14] with a luxury Airship about this
[16:42:17] director I've asked around this Airship
[16:42:20] named the radiant felspar belongs to to
[16:42:23] the alala family this conference between
[16:42:26] the IPC and the family will have a
[16:42:28] direct impact on penton's future such an
[16:42:32] important event should have been held at
[16:42:35] it
[16:42:37] well somewhere secretive in the moment
[16:42:39] of mourning Jew the atmosphere
[16:42:43] here it doesn't feel serious
[16:42:46] enough if I'm right this conference is
[16:42:50] probably just a Prelude whoever organiz
[16:42:53] it wants to assess the IPC stance
[16:42:57] beforehand this influential figure
[16:42:59] either has their own Ambitions and wants
[16:43:01] to reach a preliminary agreement or also

[16:43:05] pressure your mind is always so sharp
[16:43:08] dur thank you for the reminder but I

[16:48:36] explaining matters to me
[16:48:42] goodbye
[16:48:44] hello the talent motivation Department
[16:48:48] again internal review will it ever end
[16:48:55] I'm working on a major project I don't
[16:48:57] have time to squabble with you guys
[16:48:59] squabble the way I handled the urillo
[16:49:01] case was approved by Senior Management
[16:49:04] and all of the project logs and calls
[16:49:06] are complete can't you check on them
[16:49:09] yourselves I just don't understand why
[16:49:12] are you so fixated on this minor case
[16:49:15] and constantly escalating it I seriously
[16:49:19] what's your
[16:49:20] purpose sounds exhausted
[16:49:24] why not just hang
[16:49:27] up in my opinion what the [ __ ] project
[16:49:31] quite well a little ball of ice in
[16:49:34] exchange for the astral expresses oh
[16:49:36] wait you guys couldn't see I was playing
[16:49:38] Wordle I just didn't change my for the
[16:49:41] Department it's been a while little yena
[16:49:44] I didn't change my OBS oh what is
[16:49:45] happening wait forward to working with
[16:49:47] you never imagined this day would come
[16:49:50] so
[16:49:51] soon is there
[16:49:53] trouble you can tell me
[16:49:56] anything just like old
[16:49:59] times ah it's been a while Madam Jade
[16:50:03] I'm honored to have the opportunity to
[16:50:04] work with what was that you're still so
[16:50:07] formal aren't
[16:50:09] you forget about the hierarchy and treat
[16:50:11] me as your equal no need for Unnecessary
[16:50:14] titles like
[16:50:18] Madam I'm sorry but it might take some
[16:50:22] time to get you to that after all you
[16:50:25] are a
[16:50:27] senior now that we're both members of St
[16:50:30] Hearts I need you to be at your best
[16:50:33] especially since the upcoming
[16:50:35] negotiations leave no room for
[16:50:38] error as sharp as you are I'm sure You'
[16:50:41] figured out the true purpose of this
[16:50:43] conference right I believe old OT has
[16:50:47] taken it upon himself to test our limits
[16:50:50] dude OT is such before the official
[16:50:52] negot ation between the IPC and panon
[16:50:56] okay no disrespect if your name or
[16:50:58] someone you know is called OT but what a
[16:51:00] [ __ ] name I'm sorry what the [ __ ] is OT
[16:51:03] that's true and it works in our
[16:51:05] favor do you know why if we can reach
[16:51:09] some s agreement with old OT beforehand
[16:51:12] and engage our opponent's boundaries our
[16:51:16] future negotiations will go much more
[16:51:18] smoothly also dude that's the while
[16:51:21] while that NPC was yapping I forgot to
[16:51:23] change my OBS scene but I was trying to
[16:51:25] do the whle and I guess cream and it was
[16:51:26] actually pretty good so it might be like
[16:51:28] C
[16:51:30] camel oh
[16:51:32] my
[16:51:34] camon wait wait wait I'll find it oh
[16:51:38] Cameo Cameo I just spit everywhere oh
[16:51:41] nice
[16:51:42] exactly and the hidden benefit is that
[16:51:46] as the head of the alala family his
[16:51:48] action suggests that the five lineages
[16:51:51] might not be as United as the ODS of
[16:51:53] Harmony would suggest as long as the
[16:51:55] influence of Harmony hasn't completely
[16:51:58] permeated their core personal desires
[16:52:01] will always have their
[16:52:03] way thankfully influential figures in
[16:52:06] pentacon haven't entirely suppress their
[16:52:09] own desires okay similar to the power
[16:52:12] struggles within the
[16:52:13] IPC the supposed all for one philosoph
[16:52:16] all for one my hero
[16:52:20] Academia sorry gone after the downfall
[16:52:24] of the Yoke family old ot's faction
[16:52:26] became the dominant force in
[16:52:28] paniconi even if we consider only the
[16:52:31] succession order he's the longest
[16:52:33] serving and most senior among all the
[16:52:35] family heads yes yes exactly why we need
[16:52:39] to following an agreed strategy d i
[16:52:42] could be Jade it's like playing a game
[16:52:44] of chess where every move needs to be
[16:52:47] carried dude one day I'm going to voice
[16:52:48] an NPC and you be like holy [ __ ] Z I
[16:52:50] didn't know you had that in you you have
[16:52:52] such good
[16:52:53] range absolutely the three steps of
[16:52:57] negotiation listen test and strike I
[16:53:00] don't think those are the actual steps
[16:53:02] of negotiation but pretty clear although
[16:53:05] you seem to have changed the listen test
[16:53:09] strike that was based on my personal
[16:53:12] experience I apologize for interrupting
[16:53:15] your conversation but the family head is
[16:53:18] time to get to work let's prepare
[16:53:20] ourselves and meet that esteemed support

[16:54:48] biography is a mustre for all Strategic
[16:54:51] investment Department employee after all
[16:54:54] to many you are the legendary figure who
[16:54:57] single-handedly built the pentacon
[16:55:01] economy I expected no less from the 10
[16:55:04] stone hearts from the Strategic
[16:55:06] investment
[16:55:07] Department you're definitely skilled in
[16:55:10] the art of
[16:55:11] conversation I always enjoy talking to
[16:55:14] smart people because we don't have to
[16:55:17] beat her around the bush we can just get
[16:55:20] straight to the point instead
[16:55:23] since I enjoy talking to smart people
[16:55:26] because we don't have to beat around the
[16:55:27] bush I'm sure you figured out the topic
[16:55:30] I'd like to discuss
[16:55:34] yes the future of penacon if I'm not
[16:55:39] mistaken precisely those few words
[16:55:42] represent a terribly complicated
[16:55:44] situation indeed let's take that
[16:55:47] golden-haired guy who's not showing up
[16:55:49] for example Aventure put in great effort
[16:55:51] and almost got himself killed but what
[16:55:54] was it all for wasn't it eventually to
[16:55:58] create an opportunity for you IPC to
[16:56:00] regain control of the precious
[16:56:04] aana the wisdom and experience you've
[16:56:06] accumulated over 10 adventuring are
[16:56:09] truly impressive this might be my worst
[16:56:11] take of all time but he might be my
[16:56:12] favorite okay it's between him and
[16:56:14] Sparkle but he might be my favorite peny
[16:56:16] character trying to think of who else at
[16:56:18] least like from the quest we've seen
[16:56:20] that was really good dude he's [ __ ]
[16:56:21] sick
[16:56:24] let's assume your assumptions are
[16:56:25] correct comment take I mean I guess he
[16:56:27] is popular how would you respond to the
[16:56:29] ipc's
[16:56:31] actions I appreciate your composure Miss
[16:56:35] Jade you must have witnessed much in
[16:56:37] your worldly
[16:56:39] experiences however perhaps you don't
[16:56:42] know much about pen appreciate you
[16:56:45] e old OT won't sit idly by when faced
[16:56:49] with a greedy w i don't play gotu
[16:56:51] anymore but as ask quick question what
[16:56:53] is Amber era Amber era so Amber is a
[16:56:55] three star lonee in honai star rail it's
[16:56:56] also a gem a stone but uh what the Amber
[16:56:59] ERA refers to is around two years ago
[16:57:01] when people discovered that Amber with
[16:57:03] elgy for the end could be a good uh use
[16:57:06] full support in a double pyro Hut team
[16:57:09] VV Vape because Hut can't apply pyro
[16:57:11] without using her skill which has a long
[16:57:12] cool down so you don't want to do that
[16:57:14] right so you could set up by using Amber
[16:57:16] uh her e or her Q or whatever usually
[16:57:18] her Q actually uh and then you would not
[16:57:20] her e and then you would uh swirl that
[16:57:22] with LG for the end and be a good
[16:57:32] support please go ahead I'm all
[16:57:38] ears then I'll be doesn't red nose in uh
[16:57:42] in like anime it means they're drunk no
[16:57:44] is that a thing disuade the or does he
[16:57:46] just have like makeup Department from
[16:57:49] trying to lay a finger on panone
[16:57:54] if you back off now you can make a
[16:57:57] smooth exit and prevent the IPC or I
[16:58:01] guess face during more important
[16:58:04] negotiations okay I don't think it's
[16:58:05] pronounced negotiations but all
[16:58:08] good one of our p45 Executives was
[16:58:11] attacked and nearly killed in the
[16:58:13] Dreamscape vipc can't simply ignore this
[16:58:17] incident moreover considering the
[16:58:20] turbulence during the Charmy f Festival
[16:58:23] penton's credibility has taken a hit in
[16:58:25] the Public's eyes despite your
[16:58:28] determined attitude the issues plaguing
[16:58:30] pentacon are real are they
[16:58:35] not you use the term real Miss topz but
[16:58:39] let's not forget that this is the realm
[16:58:42] of okay no shade this might be the most
[16:58:44] boring conversation of all time but old
[16:58:46] OT looks cool at least
[16:58:49] unconventional I'm getting flashbacks of
[16:58:51] like my University lectures man the
[16:58:54] IPC well I don't mind
[16:58:57] sharing my actions will help Panic Take
[16:59:00] a significant step forward by self
[16:59:03] listing oh it's the [ __ ] it's trial
[16:59:05] it's the whale from the the abyss
[16:59:08] public if I'm not mistaken you want to
[16:59:11] bypass the IPC and go public on a
[16:59:15] universal scale
[16:59:17] precisely instead of watching the IPC no
[16:59:21] way okay you can't even make that joke
[16:59:23] cuz my star is like actually like I'm
[16:59:26] using an S3 [ __ ] eyes of prey on
[16:59:30] Black Swan starting today anyone in the
[16:59:33] cosmos can become a shareholder of the
[16:59:36] land of the dreams hey public company I
[16:59:38] get it cool of Harmony I'll
[16:59:45] choose this reform should have been
[16:59:48] implemented earlier but unfortunately
[16:59:52] the oak family were a bunch of
[16:59:54] Blockheads blinded by
[16:59:56] order their level of intellectual
[16:59:59] flexibility doesn't even come close to
[17:00:01] an old fellow like me okay thanks to the
[17:00:05] little reverberation earlier the biggest
[17:00:09] obstacle between me and my reforms has
[17:00:12] been
[17:00:14] eliminated the alala family will
[17:00:17] publicize the financial results of sweet
[17:00:20] dream Paradise so that the entire
[17:00:23] universe can see that despite the
[17:00:26] catastrophe penacon still holds immense
[17:00:29] potential and
[17:00:31] opportunities and that the family
[17:00:33] remains confident in its
[17:00:38] future H crisis and opportunity are two
[17:00:42] sides of the same
[17:00:44] coin so you've been waiting for the
[17:00:47] right moment for penacon to regain the
[17:00:49] spotlight and if penacon should seize
[17:00:52] this opportunity to overcome adversity
[17:00:54] even if the IPC tries to intervene every
[17:00:57] move we make will be scrutinized by
[17:01:00] trillions of people I don't think
[17:01:01] there's trillions of people it's
[17:01:02] billions but it's it's okay Jade I mean
[17:01:05] you don't need to know that it's fine
[17:01:07] convinc that you've indeed familiarized
[17:01:09] yourself with my biography Miss Jade so
[17:01:13] about your next move please consider it
[17:01:17] carefully you see as a child
[17:01:22] a Charmy Dove flew into my
[17:01:27] backyard I suggest we conclude the first
[17:01:29] half of our conference Mr alala please
[17:01:32] allow topz and me to confer privately
[17:01:34] for a few moments and to respond on
[17:01:37] behalf of the IPC
[17:01:40] later of course take your time dear
[17:01:49] ladies the [ __ ] says Dear ladies
[17:01:53] Trail baser POV thank God family had a
[17:01:56] meeting with the oh my God it's Dan hung
[17:01:58] I got this information from a message
[17:02:00] sent by that IPC Ambassador you heard
[17:02:02] Firefly talking about blade return to
[17:02:05] favor where is he it's not hard to
[17:02:07] imagine pentac we score to S pretty much
[17:02:10] like the frontier prison it once was
[17:02:13] with external forces casting greedy eyes
[17:02:17] and the undercurrent of order lurking
[17:02:19] within instead of falling into into a
[17:02:22] situation where they are plagued by both
[17:02:24] external and internal threats panone
[17:02:28] would rather take a step back and invite
[17:02:31] the IPC to negotiate at the table
[17:02:34] ostensibly to cooperate but in reality
[17:02:38] to secure more opportunities for their
[17:02:40] own Survival well no wonder they sought
[17:02:43] the mediation from the astral
[17:02:45] Express in your opinion who should we
[17:02:48] stand behind I don't think the followers
[17:02:51] of the Harmon are completely innocent
[17:02:53] victims in all of this man [ __ ] the
[17:02:56] harmony followers they have a strong
[17:02:58] desire to smooth things over which leads
[17:03:01] to speculation about their motives if
[17:03:04] either the family or IPC were to assume
[17:03:07] full and [ __ ] the order it would
[17:03:10] return illusory dream of Hedonism and
[17:03:14] theism I know what that word
[17:03:17] means once again go to waste the ethical
[17:03:20] theory that pleasure is the highest good
[17:03:22] and oh wait I learned about this the
[17:03:24] highest good and proper aim of human
[17:03:26] life pleasure in the sense of
[17:03:27] satisfaction of
[17:03:29] desires you are did you rest well I mean
[17:03:34] yeah it is the the gacha gacha player
[17:03:37] mentality I didn't disturb you since you
[17:03:39] were in a bigger number better person
[17:03:41] okay feel like a long dream where is
[17:03:43] himo ah she went to negotiate with the
[17:03:47] family as a representative of the crew
[17:03:50] she'll contact us once her arrangements
[17:03:52] are
[17:03:54] ready after Anna's dream was shattered
[17:03:57] the family Branch from the Montour
[17:03:59] system soon arrived and swiftly took
[17:04:02] control of the situation most members of
[17:04:05] the oak family fell unconscious but
[17:04:07] fortunately their lives were not in
[17:04:10] danger The Mastermind behind the plans
[17:04:13] was confirmed to be gopher wood the
[17:04:16] previous dream
[17:04:17] master but by the time we arrived he
[17:04:21] forgot go for w what about Sunday he'll
[17:04:25] face a
[17:04:27] trial as for further
[17:04:30] details the family would rather not
[17:04:32] disclose them ultimately the public
[17:04:35] perceived the incident as an attack by
[17:04:37] evil forces targeting the Charmy
[17:04:39] Festival they believe the family failed
[17:04:42] to safeguard the sweet dream
[17:04:44] significantly eroding their credibility
[17:04:46] in the process okay while quite
[17:04:49] different from the truth impact this
[17:04:52] appears to be the outcome with the least
[17:04:54] impact after all you don't know who's
[17:04:57] awake and who's pretending to be wait
[17:04:58] speaking of what the public knows do you
[17:05:00] guys remember when in the face of danger
[17:05:02] can you shut up I don't know who you are
[17:05:04] subsides they'll embrace the sweet dream
[17:05:07] again can you do you guys remember when
[17:05:08] we [ __ ] uh uh [ __ ] you oh is it the
[17:05:11] Shia girl wait my bad sorry sorry sorry

[17:05:20] but um you guys remember in in jillo V
[17:05:23] when we were doing the story Quest and
[17:05:24] then or bog whatever and then [ __ ] BR
[17:05:27] was like huh die CIA and then CIA died
[17:05:30] and then she was like now we're going to
[17:05:32] build a new city not one build on lies
[17:05:35] and then instead of being truthful and
[17:05:37] saying coolia was a bad person she lied
[17:05:39] and was like yeah this happened and then
[17:05:41] lied okay anyways what happened hello
[17:05:43] again yeah it's good to see you all
[17:05:45] again although we might be saying
[17:05:46] goodbye again after this reunion when
[17:05:49] will the astral Express leave pentagon
[17:05:52] we'll stay a bit longer but not too
[17:05:56] long so this is our final meeting
[17:05:59] then if this is a farewell then it seems
[17:06:03] to be missing something
[17:06:05] music
[17:06:07] Atmosphere ah maybe a special drink to
[17:06:09] honor those who are not
[17:06:11] here wait shouldn't Gallagher make the
[17:06:13] drink next drink should be yo
[17:06:16] let's dignified and unique as will use
[17:06:20] it to pay respect to those fallen heroes
[17:06:22] to the nameless resting in peace oh [ __ ]
[17:06:25] oh

[17:06:45] mix your drink yeah what happened to
[17:06:48] Gallagher oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]
[17:06:53] oh I'm not sure I haven't seen him since
[17:06:56] our last meeting at the
[17:06:58] lounge come to think of it he always did
[17:07:01] come and go quietly we used to discuss
[17:07:04] everything here but every time he'd
[17:07:06] leave I'd realize that I didn't know him
[17:07:08] at
[17:07:09] all such is the mystery that is
[17:07:12] Gallagher I have a
[17:07:14] hunch perhaps he's already fulfilled his
[17:07:17] wishes and won't be coming
[17:07:19] back let's make some drink
[17:07:22] uh would you like to talk to your
[17:07:23] friends okay they really want me to talk
[17:07:25] to my friends okay what do they say
[17:07:27] something important why do you want me
[17:07:28] to talk to them so bad it's rare for all
[17:07:30] passengers to leave the express together
[17:07:32] during a
[17:07:33] trailblaze what happened my dream the
[17:07:36] express stopped at many places and
[17:07:38] passengers came and
[17:07:40] went however the five of us were always
[17:07:44] present and the journey seemed never
[17:07:46] ending march talks about something
[17:07:48] interesting like I said well I didn't
[17:07:50] even see March what the [ __ ] is is March
[17:07:52] oh my God she's why is she over there
[17:07:55] bro what are you
[17:07:57] doing guess what something weird just
[17:08:00] happened when I was on my way over here
[17:08:03] so I unwrapped it and found out it was a
[17:08:05] button with a message on the back just
[17:08:09] press this button and all of penacon
[17:08:11] will explode that sounds
[17:08:14] terrifying could you did you press it of
[17:08:16] course not who would press something
[17:08:19] like that by the time I turned around
[17:08:22] the person had already vanished so I
[17:08:25] handed it over to a nearby Hound I heard
[17:08:28] there were many similar reports before
[17:08:30] the Charmy Festival started what if
[17:08:32] Sparkle trying to get them all to the
[17:08:33] hounds I'm really wor also okay I know I

[17:09:41] another sip cuz I was bored Bros never
[17:09:43] had moonshine okay unironically I think

[17:11:38] this with you dude she should join the
[17:11:41] astral Express what if we get thirsty
[17:11:43] fixed more of this last special drink
[17:11:44] for
[17:11:46] you the past shouldn't be
[17:11:48] forgotten so I hope it brings back the
[17:11:51] flavors of pentacon thank you uh I'm
[17:11:54] sure it'll leave a lasting
[17:11:56] impression if you happen to run into
[17:11:59] gallager make sure he has a sip too I
[17:12:02] know his tastes and cuz we have yeah we
[17:12:05] have himo brewing coffee for us like in
[17:12:07] the morning but I feel like at some
[17:12:08] point maybe give it like uh give it like
[17:12:10] one or two more like pit stops he like
[17:12:12] there might not be anyone left to make a
[17:12:14] coffee for us so having someone that can
[17:12:16] also make drinks might be nice we will
[17:12:18] all right enough with the heavy stuff
[17:12:21] you guys have important things to take
[17:12:23] care of so let's not dwell on things
[17:12:26] whether it's the astral Express or
[17:12:28] pentacon there's still a long journey
[17:12:31] ahead and Embark towards our
[17:12:35] tomorrows switching to Jade's
[17:12:38] POV old OD is a tricky opponent I didn't
[17:12:42] expect him to take the risky step of
[17:12:44] going public at such a critical moment
[17:12:47] for
[17:12:48] pentacon indeed he's definitely bold
[17:12:53] it's that kind of boldness that made him
[17:12:55] the OD Al falfa he is today still the
[17:12:59] outcome is uncertain shouting loud
[17:13:02] doesn't necessarily carry any
[17:13:04] weight what about the phone call I asked
[17:13:07] you to make topaz ah they agreed but
[17:13:11] it'll take some time before they arrive
[17:13:13] just as it should be the sweet Dew
[17:13:16] should be served after the bitter poison
[17:13:21] looks like we'll be skipping the
[17:13:22] exchanging apples step this time
[17:13:26] around now that we're dealing with a
[17:13:28] greedy Merchant a simple apple wouldn't
[17:13:31] make a difference well I guess I
[17:13:34] included myself in that remark too dude
[17:13:36] why do the [ __ ] does she have a okay why
[17:13:39] does she have a strap here like what
[17:13:41] like what is the point of that I feel
[17:13:42] like that does nothing now I'm a bit
[17:13:44] curious topaz do you think pentacon is a
[17:13:48] quality
[17:13:49] asset yes
[17:13:51] despite its recent Calamity panone
[17:13:54] remains a top quality asset within the
[17:13:56] cosmos with uh good credit lucrative
[17:14:00] potential and uh promising prospects
[17:14:03] well that's obvious but what I truly
[17:14:05] wanted to know is wait this project is
[17:14:08] obviously too bland for your taste isn't
[17:14:12] it that's true I wouldn't be here if it
[17:14:15] weren't for a venturine but despite that
[17:14:19] you trust him you even entrusted him
[17:14:22] with a
[17:14:23] Cornerstone something as precious as
[17:14:25] life itself uh are you not in the same
[17:14:28] boat Miss Jade is this Quest good so far
[17:14:30] please ask me again in an hour your Jade
[17:14:33] stone wouldn't have made it across the
[17:14:36] border
[17:14:37] so allowing you to see all desires that
[17:14:40] flow through dreams to gain a bargaining
[17:14:42] chip in
[17:14:44] negotiations that's why I'm willing to
[17:14:46] stake my top past Stone to cover for you
[17:14:49] once that kid sets his mind to something
[17:14:51] nothing can stop him not even
[17:14:55] fate well at least he's still alive and
[17:14:59] that's the best outcome bro has Zoomer
[17:15:01] brain bro they're talking about public a
[17:15:03] company and [ __ ] how what do you want me
[17:15:05] to do like I retain the information but
[17:15:07] it's either going to pay off in two
[17:15:08] hours or not but like for now it's just
[17:15:12] okay we've straighted off topic Miss
[17:15:14] Jade should we discuss our next steps no
[17:15:18] need I'll go It Alone meanwhile you can
[17:15:22] go greet our honored guest and wait for

[17:15:52] Miss Jade

[17:15:59] radiant fpar so I'm here making some
[17:16:01] preparations how about you have you
[17:16:04] spoken with Mr Alfalfa I'm actually on
[17:16:06] my way to meet him right now Alfalfa do
[17:16:09] you know him well miss
[17:16:16] Robin unfortunately I've never met him
[17:16:20] I've only heard a few comments from the
[17:16:22] former head of the oak
[17:16:24] family Mr Alfalfa is respectable when it
[17:16:27] comes to business but in other respects
[17:16:31] I can't say the
[17:16:34] same where do you think the future of
[17:16:36] the planet of festivities is headed I
[17:16:39] believe the sweet dream will see its
[17:16:42] rebirth just like the radiant felt Spar
[17:16:44] resumed its Voyage the harmony needs a
[17:16:47] new
[17:16:48] Direction only by bidding farewell to
[17:16:50] the past can we actually sail into the
[17:16:53] future there are no permanent allies or
[17:16:56] Everlasting
[17:16:57] enemies so let's both take what we need
[17:17:01] from this deal
[17:17:03] naturally I'm looking forward to your
[17:17:05] performance see you later miss
[17:17:09] jate okay keep talking with OT alal dude
[17:17:13] what a what a name holy [ __ ] OT
[17:17:17] Alfalfa that is crazy
[17:17:21] thank you for your patience Mr
[17:17:23] Alfalfa let's continue
[17:17:26] our figured out something already M
[17:17:30] Jade topaz has something else to take
[17:17:32] care of okay you'll be seeing her later
[17:17:35] talks can still continue between the two
[17:17:37] of us is it just me miss your tone
[17:17:41] sounds very different now I need to set
[17:17:44] a good example for my junior it's not a
[17:17:48] good habit to be too loose lipped during
[17:17:50] negoti ation right now we can speak
[17:17:53] frankly and openly do you believe what I
[17:17:56] said OD you're not the only Merchant who
[17:17:59] has seen the changes in the cosmic
[17:18:01] Market over the past 10 Amber eras
[17:18:07] interesting now that's interesting good
[17:18:11] it's good to be straightforward openness
[17:18:14] and transparency are my things so tell
[17:18:18] me what's your next move
[17:18:21] unfortunately I'd like to speak the
[17:18:23] harsh truth before laying out my
[17:18:26] plan let's cut to the
[17:18:28] chase first your plan won't work penacon
[17:18:33] has no way of sidest stepping the IPC
[17:18:35] and going public second you can't stop
[17:18:39] the I entering
[17:18:42] penacon we've got all the time and
[17:18:45] Connections in the world to find a way
[17:18:46] in we'll keep tearing down and
[17:18:49] rebuilding this place until the asdon
[17:18:51] system gets used to the ipc's ways again
[17:18:54] now I'm repeating your words
[17:18:57] exactly if you don't want to be a
[17:18:59] laughing stock and have everyone gunning
[17:19:02] for you at the official
[17:19:04] conference you'd better drop your little
[17:19:06] pie in the sky
[17:19:10] plan interesting you surely have a way
[17:19:14] with words now I'm curious to know what
[17:19:17] you dude this guy's past eight lines of
[17:19:20] dialogue like wohoo interesting Mr
[17:19:23] alala let's not forget that the IPC
[17:19:26] controls the biggest Interstellar
[17:19:28] publicity
[17:19:30] platform more than half the news
[17:19:32] networks in the universe if he says it
[17:19:34] again I'm going to lose my [ __ ] the
[17:19:37] moment news spreads about penacon going
[17:19:39] public trillions of customers will
[17:19:42] immediately receive a message like this
[17:19:44] the family's protection for pentacon has
[17:19:47] expired any mishaps in the Dreamscape
[17:19:50] could would result in permanent brain
[17:19:52] death permanent brain
[17:19:55] death care to guess how many ways I'm
[17:19:58] too tired to make it to find a
[17:20:00] functioning joke worthless junk within
[17:20:02] aasly 24 system hours there's a joke
[17:20:06] with Ming a certain character there I
[17:20:07] just couldn't think of one keeping a
[17:20:09] close eye on penone I you really think
[17:20:12] you can pull that off I didn't mean to
[17:20:15] click that fast sorry when the entire
[17:20:16] cosos close p i sure you won't be that
[17:20:18] hard
[17:20:20] even from peer Point as distant as it
[17:20:23] may be I'm more than capable of keeping
[17:20:25] you on a tight
[17:20:28] leash however if you agree to give up
[17:20:31] that half-baked plan to go public the
[17:20:34] IPC will assure you that will never
[17:20:37] jeopardize the interests of the family
[17:20:39] heads under your leadership after all we
[17:20:42] also need allies here in
[17:20:44] oana the IPC can assist penacon with
[17:20:47] financing starting by acquiring 30% %
[17:20:50] Equity shares 30% Equity you say who
[17:20:57] can that's the brilliant part of it all
[17:21:01] the answer is simple no one there are no
[17:21:05] guarantees it all hinges on
[17:21:07] self-awareness and mutual
[17:21:10] respect however the board of directors
[17:21:13] will consider the interests of the
[17:21:14] family heads to some extent you're a
[17:21:17] smart Merchant old OD isn't the whole
[17:21:19] purpose of this elaborate game to
[17:21:21] Showcase your business acronym and seek
[17:21:24] more benefits for the family it benefits
[17:21:27] us if we both take a step back and if
[17:21:31] that's not enough for you I'm pretty
[17:21:33] sure that another goal of making
[17:21:35] pentacon go public is to expand the
[17:21:38] influence of the planet of festivities
[17:21:40] and attract more
[17:21:41] customers I understand your concern and
[17:21:45] I have a solution for that too fine now
[17:21:49] I see your Sy sincerity sincerity as the
[17:21:52] head of the alala family I don't think I
[17:21:56] have any reason to refuse your offer
[17:21:59] however as their chosen one I still need
[17:22:04] one final answer go ahead I'm listening
[17:22:09] when I was a child I heard the adults
[17:22:12] recite the tale of the ancient Amber era
[17:22:17] about the Ascension of sheipe the harm
[17:22:21] and the downfall of Anna the the order
[17:22:24] and the preservation used to be close in
[17:22:27] ancient
[17:22:28] times so why does the
[17:22:32] IPC as a follower of the Amber Lord seek
[17:22:37] collaboration with the family instead of
[17:22:41] aligning with the order okay good
[17:22:43] question the answer is simpler than you
[17:22:45] think it's all about credits everyone's
[17:22:49] favorite thing in the Universal
[17:22:50] recognized currency Among the Stars the
[17:22:53] IPC has the power to perpetually ensure
[17:22:57] their value with each new world
[17:22:59] integrated into the credit system the
[17:23:02] IPC adds another building to its cause
[17:23:05] eventually all exchanges capital and
[17:23:08] businesses will operate within a unified
[17:23:11] monetary system by then all planetary
[17:23:15] developments will be recorded in
[17:23:16] accounts with well- defined values and
[17:23:19] the ability for exchange and
[17:23:23] circulation ah and then the IPC will be
[17:23:27] able to exert influence over
[17:23:30] everything Our intention is to establish
[17:23:34] enduring
[17:23:35] preservation so I'm sure you can
[17:23:38] understand this universe doesn't need
[17:23:41] two types of order
[17:23:45] H you think Jade sells nfts now you've
[17:23:48] convinced me all right right tell me
[17:23:51] your solution let's see if we're
[17:23:54] thinking the same thing then let's
[17:23:56] continue our
[17:23:58] conversation more
[17:24:05] convers oh hi
[17:24:09] himo thank you for your presence Miss
[17:24:12] himo please allow me to introduce her to
[17:24:15] you Mr
[17:24:16] alala this is Miss himo from the astral
[17:24:19] Express one of the future shareholders
[17:24:22] of pentacon I've heard so much about you
[17:24:24] Mr Alfalfa it's an honor to meet you as
[17:24:27] representative of the astral
[17:24:31] Express this stunning lady is the
[17:24:33] Navigator of the astral
[17:24:36] Express I believe everyone here is
[17:24:38] familiar with the general contents of
[17:24:40] The
[17:24:41] Proposal after this round of financing
[17:24:44] the IPC is expected to hold 30% of
[17:24:47] penacon shares then the IPC will
[17:24:51] transfer 5% of that stake to the astral
[17:24:54] Express and recommend Miss heo as an
[17:24:57] independent director to honor the
[17:24:59] sacrifices and contributions made by the
[17:25:02] former nameless to the land of the
[17:25:04] dreams okay while this decision isn't
[17:25:07] finalized yet we are honored that
[17:25:09] everyone here recognizes the way of the
[17:25:11] trailblaze while the nameless didn't
[17:25:13] embark on their Journeys for fame or
[17:25:16] Fortune if this is the wish of both the
[17:25:18] family and the IPC
[17:25:20] I will represent the astral Express and
[17:25:23] fulfill my duty as a member of the board
[17:25:25] of directors the entire crew has agreed
[17:25:27] to assist in the Reconstruction of
[17:25:29] pentacon beyond that in our future
[17:25:32] travels we are committed to bringing the
[17:25:34] beautiful dreams of the planet of
[17:25:35] festivities to more worlds of course all
[17:25:39] cooperation is based on one premise the
[17:25:42] path of Harmony and pentacon must not be
[17:25:44] distorted again and such a tragedy must
[17:25:47] never recur okay

[17:29:33] about the seeds of opportunity are
[17:29:36] already sewn they only need a little bit

[17:39:29] don't ask for the
[17:39:30] details 22 years yeah 22 years of
[17:39:36] chasing this guy all over the
[17:39:38] cosmos you know never thought it'd end
[17:39:41] up like this right here right now I'm
[17:39:44] going to hang up for now emge I need to
[17:39:47] raise a glass to myself
[17:39:50] they look like the dudes in Squid game
[17:39:52] the
[17:39:54] [ __ ] never mind how their wishes
[17:39:56] actually did come
[17:40:00] true
[17:40:02] but chirp chirp or a gy
[17:40:06] bird hey little birdie come on calm down
[17:40:11] already no it's not the best time to do
[17:40:14] that sorry that's what you guys wanted
[17:40:17] me to do yep
[17:40:20] okay sorry are you happy
[17:40:23] now so you're back Miss
[17:40:27] Samuel
[17:40:28] yeah I found those people and it seems
[17:40:32] their wishes did come true after
[17:40:34] visiting the bonate exchange but I'm not
[17:40:38] sure what you want me to see not so fast
[17:40:42] this step was just to show you that the
[17:40:43] bonage Jade exchange is genuine that I
[17:40:46] had the power to grant their wishes and
[17:40:49] and now I'll tell you the that to sign a
[17:40:51] contract that's why in her Al there's a
[17:40:53] contract you have to sign your life D
[17:40:55] was from a wealthy family he was head
[17:40:58] over heels for Dorothy and wanted to win
[17:41:01] her so I ate his parents so he made a
[17:41:03] deal with me he put up his entire
[17:41:06] fortune in exchange for a gift that
[17:41:08] would impress Dorothy
[17:41:11] [Music]
[17:41:22] okay sorry was a piece of cake for me
[17:41:25] thanks to my IPC
[17:41:27] connections however Dell will soon find
[17:41:30] himself evicted from the
[17:41:32] Dreamscape as he can't afford his room
[17:41:35] whether he can bounce back from poverty
[17:41:38] well that depends on him oh wait if
[17:41:42] you're from a okay wait a second not to
[17:41:44] be that guy but if you're from a wealthy
[17:41:46] family wouldn't you rather just get your
[17:41:48] money up than get your funny up why
[17:41:50] would you give it all away for a [ __ ]
[17:41:52] like let's just hope that necklace will
[17:41:54] keep the relationship from
[17:41:56] crumbling then there's Stacy a lady with
[17:41:59] a gambling addiction she wanted some
[17:42:02] serious luck but she had nothing to
[17:42:05] offer so I took something else instead I
[17:42:09] took away all her close relationships
[17:42:12] from the moment she stepped out of the
[17:42:13] Bon Jade exchange every Casino in the
[17:42:16] cosmos would her name
[17:42:19] but her parents C6 [ __ ] acaron in one
[17:42:22] Temple but I don't have friends okay so
[17:42:26] nothing changes except I'm lucky that's
[17:42:28] a net
[17:42:30] positive she will a vast wealth due to
[17:42:34] her good luck but she'll never be able
[17:42:36] to use it for the people who truly
[17:42:38] matter to her as for detective Walker he
[17:42:42] spent two decades chasing down a wanted
[17:42:45] criminal for some heinous crime but
[17:42:49] never caught the guy in his desperation
[17:42:52] he came to me he offered his own memory
[17:42:55] system as
[17:42:56] collateral in due time his memories as a
[17:43:00] detective will be erased and he will
[17:43:03] completely forget his own all the
[17:43:06] sacrifices he has made interesting don't
[17:43:09] you think I fulfill people's desires and
[17:43:12] Grant them favors and soon they come
[17:43:14] back to me with even greater desires
[17:43:17] when people see others desires get full
[17:43:19] fulfilled they develop their own desires
[17:43:22] it seems like an endless cycle but it
[17:43:25] does I feel like learning all this about
[17:43:27] Jade is kind of like I will get what I I
[17:43:29] feel like it's irrelevant if Firefly
[17:43:31] just says oh I'll pass then and then
[17:43:33] walks away but I feel like because we
[17:43:35] learned all this useless lore sorry not
[17:43:37] to upset the lore for this amazing lore
[17:43:40] I feel like Firefly is going to be like
[17:43:42] yeah actually I want to live and then
[17:43:44] she's going to bet like her leg and
[17:43:46] patience happens to be one of my
[17:43:48] greatest greatest
[17:43:50] strengths so now do you understand what
[17:43:53] you must give up Miss Samuel or should I
[17:43:56] address you
[17:43:58] as AR
[17:44:01] 26710 what the a remn what the how you
[17:44:04] know did she watch the animated
[17:44:08] short I'm not
[17:44:11] surprised you are much calmer than I
[17:44:16] expected entropy loss syndrome
[17:44:19] truly an unjust Misfortune isn't it the
[17:44:23] hups in gloth implemented such a fail
[17:44:26] safe within the genes of their
[17:44:28] Warriors just to make sure the
[17:44:30] Republic's most powerful weapons
[17:44:33] wouldn't fall into the wrong hands the
[17:44:35] [ __ ] as for the price those iron
[17:44:39] cavalries weren't exactly seen as
[17:44:41] regular independent humans so there
[17:44:44] wasn't really a price to be
[17:44:46] paid however you you are different
[17:44:51] you're now a stellon hunter a living
[17:44:53] being named
[17:44:55] Firefly naturally you want to continue
[17:44:58] your existence but with the firmament
[17:45:00] front gone the people who know the
[17:45:03] secret and can cure the disease are
[17:45:06] nowhere to be found uhoh are you
[17:45:09] suggesting that the IPC has a
[17:45:12] remedy well there might be a silver
[17:45:16] lining that's all I can say for now
[17:45:19] I
[17:45:20] see it's no wonder you said I can't
[17:45:22] provide anything of equal
[17:45:24] value because nothing I own holds any
[17:45:27] meaning damn that's not true Firefly so
[17:45:30] you you hold meaning ask me to
[17:45:33] personally restrain my partners to
[17:45:35] ensure my own
[17:45:36] Survival unfortunately that's not quite
[17:45:39] the
[17:45:41] case Partners a nice way to put
[17:45:45] it now I'm even more curious about the
[17:45:48] stellon Hun
[17:45:49] uh each of you has your silver wolf when
[17:45:51] the group chat gets leaked bond with
[17:45:53] each other strong and intimate oh [ __ ]
[17:45:56] get it allows for Independence just as
[17:45:59] the 10 ston Hearts follow Diamond you
[17:46:02] follow your own
[17:46:03] leader I wonder what they are like and
[17:46:06] if all stellon Hunters are like
[17:46:09] you traveling on the path of finality
[17:46:13] but struggling against your destiny
[17:46:15] attempting to move in the opposite
[17:46:18] direction
[17:46:20] I really hope that one day all of you
[17:46:22] will come and visit my pawn shop I'll be
[17:46:25] waiting patiently for that day can I see
[17:46:29] this as an
[17:46:30] invitation from Diamond to the stellon
[17:46:34] hunters will keeping the IPC in the dark
[17:46:38] consider it more of a personal offer for
[17:46:40] myself it doesn't represent the IPC or
[17:46:44] the Strategic investment
[17:46:46] Department the stellon Hunter have
[17:46:49] interacted with the IPC but not the 10
[17:46:52] stone
[17:46:53] hearts our paths have never crossed wait
[17:46:56] so in Firefly comes out she's going to
[17:46:58] be path of finality and then Sunday is
[17:47:00] going to be path of order to my
[17:47:03] partners you know who I
[17:47:06] am and you must know that my partner is
[17:47:09] keeping an eye on this
[17:47:11] room if she wanted to she could let the
[17:47:14] entirety of purepoint know about it
[17:47:17] within a few mere seconds what drives
[17:47:19] you to take such a risk and extend this
[17:47:22] invitation on behalf of
[17:47:24] diamond even if it could lead to your
[17:47:28] downfall simply
[17:47:32] put you and I are the
[17:47:36] same however unlike you st for the
[17:47:40] astral Express we band together merely
[17:47:43] to obtain what we
[17:47:45] want um I I don't know if I'd call you
[17:47:49] the and destined ends and on this
[17:47:52] journey we have been invited by Diamond
[17:47:54] to join
[17:47:56] him why is there a literal diamonds
[17:47:59] journe could be ficial in the
[17:48:02] back vo in our why is Fishel here from
[17:48:06] the
[17:48:07] outside bro what is she doing so diamond
[17:48:12] made us a promise to divide the power of
[17:48:15] the emanator of preservation into 10
[17:48:18] pieces and give each of us a Cornerstone
[17:48:21] to fill that void mortal flesh is
[17:48:23] fragile yet my heart is unyielding like
[17:48:25] the monolith for without this resolve
[17:48:28] the way of preservation would Fade Into
[17:48:31] Oblivion so you understand this pledge
[17:48:35] goes beyond a mere oath it's our
[17:48:38] collateral in exchange for
[17:48:46] opportunities wealth
[17:48:49] survival and a future and whatever we
[17:48:51] gain from it will fortify the ston
[17:48:53] hearts in return okay allowing us to
[17:48:56] achieve the great cause of the
[17:48:57] preservation When The War among the eons
[17:49:00] eventually
[17:49:05] comes I understand do you take your time
[17:49:08] child you don't need to give me an
[17:49:10] immediate answer like I said patience is
[17:49:14] one of my greatest
[17:49:16] strengths if fate turns that page our
[17:49:20] paths will cross again it's a shame
[17:49:23] though me when I foreshadow something
[17:49:25] that's going to happen in Patch
[17:49:29] 5.2 my last attempt in
[17:49:34] penone well s oh [ __ ] I dropped the

[17:55:00] the office of academic
[17:55:02] Affairs very well the charmony festival
[17:55:05] is about to commence soon take advantage
[17:55:07] of this unique opportunity the blend of
[17:55:09] work and play is essential for Superior
[17:55:12] knowledge
[17:55:14] absorption how do you rate a
[17:55:16] venturine this is a shatter the
[17:55:19] executives of the IPC and the guild say
[17:55:22] that we are strategic Partners yet from
[17:55:25] my perspective I am invariably the
[17:55:27] teacher and he along with you and every
[17:55:30] other individual is the student from
[17:55:32] this perspective aventurine isn't what
[17:55:34] you call an ideal student yet he's also
[17:55:39] not utterly obtuse alas the void within
[17:55:42] him can never be filled by talent and
[17:55:45] knowledge let's hope he doesn't turn
[17:55:47] into a Phil opical zombie I thought
[17:55:50] you're going to make me get my act
[17:55:51] together saying such a thing merely
[17:55:53] indicates that you have not truly
[17:55:55] grasped the essence of learning the
[17:55:58] principle of balancing work and
[17:56:00] relaxation is scientifically grounded
[17:56:03] with the relevant proof process detailed
[17:56:05] on page 21 of the
[17:56:18] doctor you're huge we should have

[17:57:01] wish blank she's guessing you're
[17:57:04] guessing she doesn't have any sense of
[17:57:05] humor sounds simple enough very
[17:57:08] pragmatic then let's discuss the cost no
[17:57:12] way this is the end game
[17:57:17] already I wouldn't be too worried to
[17:57:20] fulfill this wish the thing I need is
[17:57:22] simple the tale of an animal what animal

[17:57:30] a round head and long ears it's
[17:57:33] omnivorous and is prone to mood swings

[17:59:09] Paradise with a dream you guys even
[17:59:12] ended up shattering the
[17:59:14] dream it's truly been quite a vacation
[17:59:18] it's a good thing that you guys managed

[17:59:35] we're going back to San Jo I don't know
[17:59:37] if you saw the trailer for the next like
[17:59:39] uh like the the last uh version preview
[17:59:42] they showed Jaden stuff but they also
[17:59:43] showed a few characters from there they
[17:59:45] didn't like say what they were but we
[17:59:47] saw like Silhouettes and stuff so I it's
[17:59:49] only it's easy to assume we're going
[17:59:51] there but maybe you missed the live
[17:59:52] stream it's okay joining the stellon
[17:59:54] hunters Elio told me that this journey
[17:59:56] will tell me how to live
[17:59:58] on that's all he
[18:00:01] said as for the
[18:00:03] rest it's up to me to find out ELO so
[18:00:08] I'll pay extra attention to any leads
[18:00:10] that will let me live
[18:00:13] on this trip to pentacon is no different
[18:00:17] no wonder you were interested in
[18:00:18] investing in the watchmaker looks like
[18:00:19] you didn't get what you wanted this time
[18:00:21] yes sadly I was looking in the wrong
[18:00:24] place but I did rap some rewards do you
[18:00:27] know Miss Jade from the IPC Strategic
[18:00:30] investment Department she told me her
[18:00:33] price but did you take the deal no but
[18:00:37] what she wanted wasn't my answer either
[18:00:41] of course I want to live
[18:00:44] on
[18:00:46] but would fate ow
[18:00:49] me I want it paid back not passed
[18:00:54] on no one else should be involved this
[18:00:57] is a grudge between me and fate speaking
[18:01:01] of which
[18:01:03] actually I feel that I still owe you a
[18:01:06] formal apology
[18:01:08] for that matter with the performer of
[18:01:11] the iris family even the smallest of
[18:01:14] Lies can turn into a betray as sharp as
[18:01:17] a blade
[18:01:19] I'm sorry no problem you shouldn't have
[18:01:22] lied to me in the beginning yes and for
[18:01:25] that to me hiding is much easier than
[18:01:28] being
[18:01:30] honest yet I still want to try
[18:01:33] expressing my emotions as any ordinary
[18:01:35] person

[18:03:58] unprecedented in scale with not only
[18:04:01] that the customary opening ceremony held

[18:04:23] selfless devotion to the Harmony's
[18:04:31] cause what makes this Festival so
[18:04:34] uniquely
[18:04:36] significant as is widely known the
[18:04:39] radiant belt Spar had to Halt its Voyage
[18:04:42] due to an anomaly in the sweet dream
[18:04:44] sparking widespread discussion in the 12
[18:04:47] hours
[18:04:48] thanks to the hard work of penton's
[18:04:51] internal and external factions we've
[18:04:53] finally gotten the Dreamscape back on
[18:04:55] track just in time for the Charmy
[18:04:58] festival and as they say good things
[18:05:02] come in pairs the Charming not only
[18:05:06] celebrates this achievement but also
[18:05:08] marks the relaunch of the radiant Bel
[18:05:12] Spar and finally the last reason does
[18:05:17] every everyone remember the
[18:05:19] watchmaker in truth the family yo
[18:05:22] where's M by the way efforts into this
[18:05:24] Festival just to commemorate this
[18:05:26] legendary
[18:05:28] luminary the father of pentacon M Char
[18:05:32] legwork one of the legendary nameless
[18:05:35] who laid the foundations of
[18:05:40] pentacon in the most bewildering times
[18:05:43] of the planet of festivities it was he
[18:05:45] who I'm sure the with his companions who
[18:05:49] taught us through trailblazing were
[18:05:51] Freedom lies it was also they who led
[18:05:55] the Vanguard in the pioneering of the
[18:05:57] Dreamscape in exchange for what is now
[18:06:00] known as The Paradise of
[18:06:03] Harmony it can be said that penton's
[18:06:05] Splendid success today has deeply rooted
[18:06:09] in the trailblazing ethos the watchmaker
[18:06:11] planted within
[18:06:12] us only by honoring this trailblazing
[18:06:16] Spirit can we fulfill our mission and
[18:06:19] spread Harmony to a broader
[18:06:22] audience Dum a that's she's a y she's
[18:06:26] talking about us the express crew would
[18:06:29] have been disbanded long ago if it
[18:06:30] weren't for

[18:06:52] astral Express thus with unanimous
[18:06:55] consent from the five major lineages

[18:07:01] members throughout the cosmos offer a
[18:07:04] token of appreciation to the nameless oh

[18:16:19] misdirected by her appalling
[18:16:26] prank
[18:16:28] he not
[18:16:32] my
[18:16:36] investigate you jump I'll jump
[18:16:38] too the
[18:16:42] Hell My Heart Will Go On holy [ __ ]
[18:16:46] [ __ ] Seline
[18:16:49] Dion you missed it wait but does it
[18:16:53] matter I'm supposed to talk to
[18:16:55] Firefly 28 minutes 46 seconds 28 minutes
[18:16:58] 45 seconds you're here Sparkle eat my
[18:17:04] bat Don't Come Close this bomb is very
[18:17:07] dangerous and I'm the real Firefly since
[18:17:11] you're here I'll just keep it short just
[18:17:14] over half an hour ago I received a
[18:17:15] message from an unknown sender and
[18:17:17] rushed here as soon as I could 27
[18:17:19] minutes 52 seconds the sweet dream has
[18:17:22] lost the protection of the order if it
[18:17:24] were to blow up here the consequences
[18:17:26] would be unfathomable I've scrutinized
[18:17:29] it for a long time but the bomb's design
[18:17:31] is incredibly unique as if it's been
[18:17:34] locked by some mysterious path force
[18:17:37] apart from its creator I fear no one
[18:17:39] knows how to deactivate it Mommy I don't
[18:17:42] want to die
[18:17:48] H
[18:17:50] actually there might be another way do
[18:17:53] you still remember the script said that
[18:17:55] I will experience death three times in
[18:17:57] the land of dreams oh she's going to
[18:17:59] sack herself I think this moment Heralds
[18:18:02] the third time oh well what's your
[18:18:07] plan you may already know that I have no
[18:18:10] way of evoking dreams I employ a stellon
[18:18:14] hunter special method in order to enter
[18:18:16] dreams instead this allows me to perform
[18:18:19] Feats that typical just put the bomb in
[18:18:21] Jade's
[18:18:22] room as long as I can bear the pain of
[18:18:25] the Memoria pressure I'll be able to
[18:18:28] dive into the Primal memory Zone beyond
[18:18:30] the dream and extend a Lifeline to the
[18:18:33] radiant Feld Spar I will take this bomb
[18:18:35] into the depths of the
[18:18:37] Dreamscape as deep as possible where
[18:18:39] there are no living Souls around that
[18:18:42] way at least no one will get hurt what
[18:18:45] about you
[18:18:50] don't
[18:18:51] worry I believe that this Firefly armor
[18:18:53] will be enough to take me to where I
[18:18:55] need to go before the countdown
[18:18:57] ends and maybe even make it back
[18:19:01] safely at present this is our best and
[18:19:05] most logical course of action after all
[18:19:09] a long story deserves a happy
[18:19:12] ending I have some words to share with
[18:19:14] you though they were spoken to me by
[18:19:17] Miss
[18:19:18] Aaron she said that wait the so-called
[18:19:22] impossible is merely something that is
[18:19:24] yet to happen at the moment there are so
[18:19:27] many things that seem impossible but are
[18:19:30] they really never going to do we know
[18:19:31] how big the bomb is can you just like
[18:19:33] suggest that the moment to disprove
[18:19:35] these impossibilities it off the
[18:19:38] [ __ ] whether it be a literal ending
[18:19:42] suffering akin to
[18:19:44] death or a harrowing death
[18:19:48] Escape before the appointed destination
[18:19:51] arrives like you're literally on a ship
[18:19:54] yet I can still make Mary had
[18:19:57] choices I also firmly believe
[18:20:01] that that when that moment arrives for
[18:20:03] us to make a choice what if it's just
[18:20:06] confetti cuz sparkle silly and goofy
[18:20:08] already be within our hearts it is not
[18:20:12] destiny that shapes us but we who shape
[18:20:18] Destiny the astral express wait cut
[18:20:20] scene what the [ __ ] are like light hello
[18:20:23] we were we walk on different paths
[18:20:27] intertwined moving forward and growing
[18:20:30] together it's just a sparkle doll man
[18:20:33] just throw it off the ship but it is not
[18:20:36] today since things are going too well
[18:20:39] let's speed up the
[18:20:41] countdown human life is
[18:20:44] short just like fire FES to a flame wait
[18:20:48] is that how you spell fireflies you have
[18:20:49] an answer in your
[18:20:51] heart always remember don't leave with
[18:20:54] any
[18:20:56] regrets we have this
[18:20:58] right what the fck is
[18:21:01] [Music]
[18:21:09] happening silent it was
[18:21:13] fireworks I
[18:21:17] I told you Sparkle would never about
[18:21:19] other people's safety why don't you go
[18:21:22] take a closer
[18:21:28] look
[18:21:29] okay what the [ __ ] is
[18:21:32] happening everything is possible in this
[18:21:35] land of
[18:21:36] dreams you just got B their own goals
[18:21:40] and realize them in unimaginable
[18:21:43] ways regardless if the result was a
[18:21:46] sweet
[18:21:47] illusion or a bitter
[18:21:51] reality it was an answer he longed for
[18:21:54] day I like how everyone's like happy
[18:21:56] with their friends and then Robin just
[18:21:58] doesn't have a brother why choose to
[18:22:01] well she I don't know where he is I
[18:22:03] think it's as you
[18:22:05] said because in the
[18:22:07] end we will wake up from our dreams
[18:22:14] [Music]
[18:22:36] when I arrived I happened to see a child
[18:22:39] holding
[18:22:40] it he said the flowers were prepared by
[18:22:43] Aunt Jesse for the watch maker and the
[18:22:46] war comrade he'd missed his whole life
[18:22:49] Mel would place two bunches of flowers
[18:22:52] here year after
[18:22:54] year and after he
[18:22:57] left it became three your wishes will
[18:23:01] always be remembered by
[18:23:04] someone now panone as you hoped has
[18:23:08] welcomed the dawn after a long dark
[18:23:11] night the path forward may not be a bit
[18:23:14] of
[18:23:14] roses but at least people are prepared
[18:23:17] to step forth towards
[18:23:21] Freedom
[18:23:23] Tian you can go home
[18:23:25] now well the nameless are also preparing
[18:23:29] for the next stop of their
[18:23:31] Voyage oh sure it's
[18:23:35] [Music]
[18:23:36] us but before leaving we still have one
[18:23:40] last thing to do
[18:23:50] say goodbye to
[18:23:52] you it is my
[18:23:55] honor I've said many
[18:23:57] goodbyes yet I am glad that this is the
[18:24:01] first time I speak these words with a
[18:24:03] smile but before leaving I'm sure you
[18:24:06] all have plenty to say to the nameless
[18:24:08] of the past A fitting end to the tale of
[18:24:12] The
[18:24:12] Departed one could not ask for a better
[18:24:15] farewell
[18:24:17] go on they're all
[18:24:25] here one second sorry
[18:24:30] uh
[18:24:32] Monument bid farewell to the
[18:24:35] nameless honestly when I heard the
[18:24:38] conductor's request I was pretty
[18:24:40] surprised the nameless those who Trail
[18:24:44] Blaze doing good deeds but never seeking
[18:24:47] recognition after all this time how
[18:24:50] would we even find those three people in
[18:24:52] such a vast place like pentacon but it
[18:24:55] seems in the land of the dreams anything
[18:24:59] anything is possible history may not
[18:25:01] remember the names of the dead but the
[18:25:04] Stars will attest to their Journeys the
[18:25:07] first glimmer of light in the prolonged
[18:25:09] night often illuminates little as it is
[18:25:12] fleeting in the darkness too vast but
[18:25:15] because of this people will
[18:25:18] remember as long as something shines in
[18:25:21] the night sky then when the first star
[18:25:24] falls countless more will follow
[18:25:28] streaking across the
[18:25:30] Horizon a
[18:25:33] toast Brooklyn
[18:25:35] Tian Rosalina J and
[18:25:38] Estella we raise a toast to you
[18:25:41] Trailblazers of the silver rail a toast
[18:25:43] to history that no longer remains silent
[18:25:47] the passionate and courageous Pursuit
[18:25:50] and a
[18:25:51] voyage that traverses the
[18:25:55] stars all right kind of don't care about
[18:25:58] the previous nameless but all good bid
[18:26:00] for to Gallagher uh
[18:26:04] oh that statue it wasn't here last time
[18:26:09] looks like this is the last Riddle That
[18:26:11] Mr Gallagher left for us in the end we
[18:26:14] still failed to figure out his true
[18:26:16] identity or if he was even a living
[18:26:19] person what should I
[18:26:22] say I mean this guy is definitely a
[18:26:25] history fictionist that's not a real job
[18:26:28] fictiony is not real time at the them
[18:26:31] that's like astrologist 13 years old
[18:26:34] could that have meant something
[18:26:37] too either way he's an enigmatic
[18:26:42] character for
[18:26:44] sure at least our journey together in
[18:26:46] panone was real enough and his loyalty
[18:26:50] and lovea is real okay sorry must have
[18:26:53] been real too oh Stars give these
[18:26:56] Trailblazers a
[18:27:00] blessing Gallagher we raise a toast to
[18:27:03] you the slumbering
[18:27:05] Hound to the festival's invitation to
[18:27:09] all lies and the singular
[18:27:12] truth If We Ever Meet Again please
[18:27:16] please don't talk in
[18:27:19] riddles cheers to Gallagher why is 100
[18:27:22] met away I probably could teleport okay

[18:27:33] depart

[18:27:44] indebted
[18:27:46] learn like as the represent are't we
[18:27:48] missing stuff to make another toast to
[18:27:50] all the nameless like obviously it is
[18:27:52] but like but like I feel like do now
[18:27:56] don't we want to see like the aftermath
[18:27:57] continue to live here those accustomed
[18:28:00] to being awake will mostly have a hard
[18:28:02] time getting used to a life of Darkness
[18:28:04] with their eyes closed though the order
[18:28:07] has faded there must be someone to watch
[18:28:10] over this Primal memory
[18:28:13] Zone penton's nights are long and there
[18:28:16] are many who are still far yeah I guess
[18:28:18] we'll probably go back at some point as
[18:28:20] for the sweet dream over there luris
[18:28:23] Skipper no like they told us what
[18:28:25] happened to Sunday but we didn't like
[18:28:26] see it like sorry I don't like a [ __ ]
[18:28:30] one hint In The Wind that tells me what
[18:28:32] happened [ __ ] show me
[18:28:34] something Ma and residents of dream flux
[18:28:38] Reef we also I just want to see more
[18:28:40] venturine Watchers of the long but also
[18:28:43] Sunday's not out yet so they'll probably
[18:28:45] like they have to him somehow so we'll
[18:28:47] probably go back night and to the dawn
[18:28:51] that is finally upon
[18:28:58] [Music]

[18:29:04] sorry sorry sorry sorry

[18:29:12] Hill had like less than 30 23 minutes of
[18:29:14] screen time yeah but 20 of those 23 he
[18:29:17] forced himself in our [ __ ] ship when
[18:29:19] we tried to play the game unskippable
[18:29:22] cutscene six in a row he so [ __ ] him
[18:29:25] sorry one day I like Boot
[18:29:29] Hill but his emo does not appear before
[18:29:31] you standing before you is a Resolute
[18:29:33] individual one who does not rely on
[18:29:34] others to guide his feelings what the
[18:29:36] [ __ ] even if everyone's lies were
[18:29:38] offered to the shatter dream his Spirit
[18:29:40] would remain intact unwavering wait what
[18:29:43] a Chad what the [ __ ] damn dreams well
[18:29:47] this is how they're meant to be plain
[18:29:49] and
[18:29:55] [Music]
[18:29:57] simple okay can I talk to Aron yet or is
[18:30:01] that
[18:30:04] later this guy RI Boo in the end we
[18:30:09] still came full circle this trailblazing
[18:30:12] Expedition started from the moment you
[18:30:14] and a bell boy ran into each other
[18:30:16] after going on a journey of many twists
[18:30:18] and turns they still ended up where they
[18:30:22] started just like a clock's hands that
[18:30:24] turn round and round the start and end
[18:30:27] of each day will always land on 12:00
[18:30:30] what if what if we entered okay what if
[18:30:32] okay hear me out we land in penan first
[18:30:35] time Misha greets us right then we meet
[18:30:38] [ __ ] like Sunday Robin we shoot
[18:30:40] Sunday cuz he gives weird Vibes we
[18:30:42] already knew that shoot Misha cuz [ __ ]
[18:30:44] you and then boom we're at like
[18:30:46] effectively the same ending but like
[18:30:47] Gallagher is still
[18:30:50] alive there shouldn't be much left to
[18:30:52] say this entire Adventure started
[18:30:55] because of you and should naturally end
[18:30:58] with
[18:31:00] you and then a new page will be
[18:31:03] turned a
[18:31:06] toast are you stupid yes but that was
[18:31:09] apparent we raise a toast to you
[18:31:12] watchmaker of the land of the dreams
[18:31:14] nameless of the astral Express to
[18:31:17] penton's past present and future future
[18:31:21] and the child's unwavering dream unto
[18:31:27] death with that our duty as nameless
[18:31:29] should be complete right the trailblaze
[18:31:33] can illuminate the
[18:31:34] way but
[18:31:37] ultimately the future of a world belongs
[18:31:40] to those who live in
[18:31:42] [Music]
[18:31:44] it I still feel that Mr male must have
[18:31:48] really wanted to witness this day
[18:31:53] himself what's on your mind
[18:31:56] March just a strange
[18:31:59] feeling I had it a few stops ago but
[18:32:02] it's super strong this time why not talk
[18:32:05] about it maybe everyone's thinking the
[18:32:07] same
[18:32:10] thing I can't help but think that
[18:32:13] whether it's Mr male Mr tiin or Madame
[18:32:18] Rosalina their lives must have been long
[18:32:22] and they must have experienced plenty of
[18:32:26] stories they were also young ones
[18:32:29] stumbling and bumbling around just like
[18:32:32] us getting into scraps and Mischief that
[18:32:35] sort of
[18:32:36] stuff companions enemies Journeys
[18:32:42] adventures all the sad and happy
[18:32:44] memories
[18:32:46] the everyday that we're used to that
[18:32:49] game lagging we' lived through them
[18:32:52] too but those things are all in the past
[18:32:57] one day our stories will also be a part
[18:32:59] of the past you'll be like oh
[18:33:02] remember
[18:33:04] when 30 years ago I used to play Star
[18:33:07] rail I
[18:33:11] remember it'll be easier to understand
[18:33:14] if I use an analogy
[18:33:16] like when you're reading a book if one
[18:33:19] of its characters keeps running into
[18:33:22] obstacles and experiences an ending man
[18:33:26] I remember when Jade came out we're
[18:33:27] bound to feel a bit mixed about it
[18:33:38] right to me it's because we've seen
[18:33:41] every nook and cranny of their lives
[18:33:44] okay low key though special look I hope
[18:33:47] every update keeps getting better and
[18:33:48] better and better but like what if in
[18:33:50] like 5 years they're like man I miss
[18:33:52] peny that was Peak like I I wish I could
[18:33:54] go back and now we're like in
[18:33:58] peny so even if there are parts of it
[18:34:02] that aren't really realistic nor logical
[18:34:06] we still hope that their story gets a
[18:34:07] good ending when it
[18:34:12] comes but what if they
[18:34:16] and we aren't really that
[18:34:19] special when Mr male sat in this chair
[18:34:23] waiting for the astral Express to arrive
[18:34:25] every day what was he thinking and if at
[18:34:29] the end of his life he could still
[18:34:30] firmly say he had no
[18:34:34] regrets then what is this regret we feel
[18:34:37] in our hearts right
[18:34:41] now I think each and every one of us is
[18:34:44] searching for the the answer to this
[18:34:46] very question the universe is vast and
[18:34:50] our lives are but specks the trailblaze
[18:34:53] Never Ends but against the backdrop of
[18:34:55] the cosmos the average person's lifelong
[18:34:58] journey is merely a short stretch but it
[18:35:02] is in this minuscule distance that paths
[18:35:06] cross and countless worlds
[18:35:09] connect the universe may not remember
[18:35:11] every person who leaves a tie along the
[18:35:13] silver whale but we will as long as we
[18:35:17] remember their stories will never
[18:35:20] end whatever you say gorgeous what Mr
[18:35:22] male has left for us is his answer to
[18:35:25] this very question it may not be perfect
[18:35:29] but it left a smile on this storied
[18:35:31] jaded old nameless his face at the end
[18:35:33] of his life and its meaning will be
[18:35:35] interpreted by those who come after
[18:35:40] us it's not the answer that's important
[18:35:45] but what we can learn from others
[18:35:47] answers right this is what trailblazing
[18:35:53] is
[18:35:55] sure I'm really sorry for bringing down
[18:35:58] the vibe quick Don Hong tell us a dad
[18:36:01] joke to lighten the
[18:36:08] mood it's never a bad thing to reflect
[18:36:12] one day we'll all have to face our own
[18:36:14] farewells well probably you before us
[18:36:16] weld you're [ __ ] like 86 years
[18:36:19] old but before that we still have a long
[18:36:23] way ahead of us
[18:36:26] sorry so the most important thing right
[18:36:29] now is to tell the conductor what we saw
[18:36:31] bro literally comes from honkey impact
[18:36:33] first he lived through first second and
[18:36:35] third honky then prepare ourselves for
[18:36:38] our next trailblazing
[18:36:41] destination I should get back to the
[18:36:43] express or maybe maybe I could say my
[18:36:46] final goodbye to acaron wait where the
[18:36:48] [ __ ] is acaron also man I'm tired of
[18:36:50] [ __ ] I'm I for 7 hours 40 and have to
[18:36:53] stream again tomorrow you're just
[18:36:55] getting old dude I flew back home today
[18:36:58] do you still remember when we first
[18:37:00] arrived in
[18:37:01] pentacon who would have thought our
[18:37:03] paths would cross in such a way well I
[18:37:05] mean I could have guessed it cuz you're
[18:37:06] like R in and there's like right in
[18:37:08] every game significant plus when you
[18:37:09] talk to us it was in red bold plus
[18:37:11] there's like a epic cut scene when we
[18:37:12] met you but it's okay I mean who would
[18:37:14] have thought uh who exactly are you come
[18:37:17] to think of it I didn't even get a
[18:37:19] chance to formally introduce myself
[18:37:22] simply put I'm a self Annihilator who
[18:37:24] was cursed by the
[18:37:26] nihility my hometown was destroyed a
[18:37:29] long time ago and the whole world was
[18:37:32] erased beneath their
[18:37:34] shadow in order to fight against the
[18:37:37] cruel end of
[18:37:38] self-destruction I went on a journey in
[18:37:41] search of a way to sever the chains of
[18:37:43] the nihility
[18:37:46] after a long and grueling search I am
[18:37:49] convinced that my destination lies
[18:37:51] within the depths of the dark web no
[18:37:53] don't don't go on there Aaron no in
[18:37:57] there lurks a secret called device
[18:38:01] 9 one day I'll reach
[18:38:04] it we We Ever Meet Again the ocean of
[18:38:07] stars is vast and given our destinations
[18:38:11] I'm afraid our paths may not cross again
[18:38:13] you want to join the astral Express the
[18:38:15] trailblazing Expedition ahead is always
[18:38:17] full of unknowns and my blade is sharp
[18:38:20] enough to sever
[18:38:22] fate as long as we maintain our original
[18:38:25] resolve I believe there will come a day
[18:38:28] where we will meet again have we met
[18:38:30] before
[18:38:32] ah in that case I must apologize for my
[18:38:36] rudess do you remember when we first
[18:38:40] met I once said you reminded me of an
[18:38:43] acquaintance because of the self
[18:38:45] Annihilator curse my memories are
[18:38:48] Stripped Away blurring my
[18:38:51] past and after our journey together what
[18:38:55] I originally thought were familiar
[18:38:57] feelings were merely Illusions wait
[18:39:00] what I believe this was truly our first
[18:39:04] meeting what the [ __ ] is that
[18:39:06] Arrow feel like it can't what if it
[18:39:09] wasn't an illusion what do you mean it's
[18:39:12] improbable that you've crossed paths
[18:39:14] with my past self
[18:39:16] what I mean is there is nothing left to
[18:39:20] retrace
[18:39:21] there only n yeah but it would be bad
[18:39:23] writing if we just like us were like we
[18:39:26] met before but like we didn't actually
[18:39:28] meet before think I might have seen
[18:39:30] someone like you I see you've also had a
[18:39:33] similar
[18:39:35] experience then you should know that
[18:39:38] this me and your memory of me are not
[18:39:41] the same person
[18:39:48] the [ __ ] chat what do you think is like
[18:39:51] the Click I feel like if you get to this
[18:39:53] dialogue option what are the odds that
[18:39:55] you click two here I feel like it's like
[18:39:57] a 1% of people click two at this point I
[18:39:59] feel like 99 plus click the red but some
[18:40:02] things will never
[18:40:06] change we made her laugh long ago I too
[18:40:11] that's a win that's a [ __ ] win
[18:40:13] placeable companions
[18:40:16] we also embarked on Journeys making the
[18:40:19] best choices we could whenever we
[18:40:23] could unfortunately we didn't achieve
[18:40:26] the outcome we
[18:40:27] wanted but moments like
[18:40:31] this make me feel like they never even
[18:40:35] left in this universe there exist
[18:40:38] countless worlds that are similar yet
[18:40:40] different and countless people who are
[18:40:43] alike yet distinct
[18:40:46] I too have wandered alone encountering
[18:40:49] acquaintances on strange worlds seeing
[18:40:52] their silouettes overlap with my past in
[18:40:56] your opinion what does this deja vu mean
[18:41:00] along longing for a certain
[18:41:05] someone attachment
[18:41:08] desire
[18:41:10] longing they may all be right but they
[18:41:13] are all incomplete
[18:41:16] I believe it's not something external
[18:41:19] but something that originates within us
[18:41:21] an emotion that traverses time from a
[18:41:24] certain moment of our past to reach us
[18:41:28] perhaps it's a source of warmth and
[18:41:31] happiness or maybe it brings pain and
[18:41:33] sorrow wait I saw something glitch each
[18:41:36] time we reminisce on our past we always
[18:41:38] seem to notice a tiny but Unforgettable
[18:41:41] instant that we left behind us along
[18:41:44] with c other things that remain constant
[18:41:48] throughout that is a summary of Our
[18:41:51] Lives encapsulating everything about us
[18:41:55] in these
[18:41:56] moments proof of our shared path within
[18:42:00] them we Glimpse our own
[18:42:03] Essence and
[18:42:05] thus we truly
[18:42:07] exist just like everyone in the story
[18:42:11] hurdling onwards along the path of
[18:42:13] Destiny with passion and courage for the
[18:42:16] things that breathe meaning into their
[18:42:19] lives set forth on your Voyage without
[18:42:22] hesitation nameless on the path of the
[18:42:26] trailblaze this looks like an
[18:42:29] emote even if the ending has been
[18:42:31] predetermined that's
[18:42:33] fine there are countless things that
[18:42:36] humans cannot
[18:42:38] change but before that on the road
[18:42:42] towards the end there are still many
[18:42:44] things that we can
[18:42:48] do and because of this the end will thus
[18:42:52] reveal a completely different meaning
[18:42:55] this is the meaning of
[18:42:59] Journey all those things beautiful
[18:43:02] before are still so
[18:43:05] now and I
[18:43:08] believe it will still Bloom at the end
[18:43:12] of the nihility
[18:43:15] until we meet again that's the [ __ ]
[18:43:16] Hawkeye one the Hawkeye third one all
[18:43:19] this lowkey cooler I lowkey like this
[18:43:21] outfit better or character I don't know
[18:43:23] I like the horns I'm going to screenshot
[18:43:28] this yo yeah why don't they make that a
[18:43:30] skin I mean they probably wouldn't
[18:43:34] but wait that's it I'm gone I don't want
[18:43:36] to talk to pom pom man I don't want to
[18:43:38] go from [ __ ] acaron to pom
[18:43:42] pom they're there chin up pom pom wow
[18:43:48] your method of consolation is
[18:43:51] truly
[18:43:53] unsophisticated still better than just
[18:43:55] standing there like a
[18:43:58] scarecrow oh hey you're finally back we
[18:44:02] told pom pom all about our adventure and
[18:44:06] they suddenly started
[18:44:08] crying the k h hop is just just angry no
[18:44:13] matter where the express stops that's
[18:44:16] right it's okay everyone could you all
[18:44:20] take a break in the next car don't worry
[18:44:23] I'll stay here with bom bom but let's
[18:44:30] go he said March shut the [ __ ]
[18:44:33] up I never expected pom pom would be so
[18:44:37] distraught those three nameless must
[18:44:40] have meant a lot to pom pom I guess she
[18:44:42] was like know exactly when pom pom B the
[18:44:45] express but I forgot pom pom's important
[18:44:47] sorry sorry their Journey has been
[18:44:49] filled I gave her the pon treatment or
[18:44:52] them my bad my bad more than we sorry
[18:44:55] sorry sorry the fact that they're crying
[18:44:57] so hard is probably a good sign it
[18:45:00] proves that emotions haven't become
[18:45:03] dulled by The Grind of time they still
[18:45:07] deeply cherish every nameless who has
[18:45:09] boarded the express and value every
[18:45:12] Journey shared with them
[18:45:15] leave it to himo when it comes to
[18:45:17] comforting there's no one better on the
[18:45:20] express poom said we might run out of
[18:45:22] fuel well they were a little emotional
[18:45:25] at the time but I'm afraid that's not
[18:45:28] out of the question since you joined us
[18:45:31] the express has stayed longer than
[18:45:33] anticipated at every stop along the way
[18:45:35] can we just get more fuel sure that
[18:45:37] everyone always makes it back on board
[18:45:40] pom pom has had no choice but to delay
[18:45:43] the warp jump schedule
[18:45:47] I
[18:45:49] see no wonder I can regularly hear pom
[18:45:52] pom pacing anxiously up and down the
[18:45:54] corridor turns out pom pom's been
[18:45:57] silently putting in a lot of work for us
[18:46:01] different from typical Vehicles the
[18:46:03] astral Express converts every trailblaze
[18:46:06] into the energy it needs to run ideally
[18:46:10] as long as trailblazing your fault okay
[18:46:13] I'm hoarding fuel will receive a can't
[18:46:16] they just buy the batt pass of energy
[18:46:18] much like a perpetual motion
[18:46:22] machine but because of our previous
[18:46:26] encounters fuel is being used up much
[18:46:29] faster than expected we can probably
[18:46:32] only pull off not everyone is a whale
[18:46:34] okay but pom bom has been around for
[18:46:36] like hundreds of years they could afford
[18:46:38] a [ __ ] battle pass if you're like 300
[18:46:40] years old and you're not like balling
[18:46:42] then you failed like okay if you're like
[18:46:44] 20 30 50 and like you know you're you
[18:46:47] still have to work that makes sense but
[18:46:48] if you're like 600 years old and you
[18:46:50] can't buy a battle pass like what are
[18:46:51] you doing you've had 5 like 600 years to
[18:46:54] figure it out only two more isn't that
[18:46:57] super
[18:46:58] risky I don't want to become an ice cube
[18:47:01] floating around in space again Falling
[18:47:04] Leaves must return to the roots how
[18:47:06] about we shove you back into Space
[18:47:08] Station's computer then which also means
[18:47:12] that we must prudently consider our next
[18:47:15] destination yesing Le already checked
[18:47:18] the astral charts the two nearest worlds
[18:47:21] to us are the oceanic planet of can we
[18:47:23] go to the ocean one please World melanin
[18:47:26] I want to C hom me in this
[18:47:27] game as for which one we're headed to
[18:47:31] that still requires a vote or perhaps
[18:47:35] you might consider a
[18:47:37] suggestion what the hello how did you
[18:47:40] get here everyone we meet again
[18:47:45] it's
[18:47:46] you why were you just in my
[18:47:53] room it's a very cute room Miss Mark
[18:47:57] what just like
[18:48:05] you memoe keeper let's put aside how you
[18:48:09] managed to sneak past everyone and board
[18:48:11] the express for now you mentioned a
[18:48:15] suggestion I accidentally overheard how
[18:48:19] the express obtains
[18:48:21] fuel I just wanted to chat with everyone
[18:48:24] to see if we could work together but now
[18:48:28] it appears my suggestion could be the
[18:48:31] very Lifeline that saves everyone please
[18:48:35] speak
[18:48:36] candidly depending on what you say we
[18:48:39] could very well ask you to
[18:48:42] disembark how do you word it like that
[18:48:44] the permanence is
[18:48:46] descendant what a Charming little dragon
[18:48:50] especially with those mired memories of
[18:48:55] yours but I
[18:48:57] digress if the astral Express is an
[18:49:00] urgent need of a special trailblazing
[18:49:03] expedition to recharge its
[18:49:05] engine have you all considered this
[18:49:09] perhaps your destination could be a
[18:49:12] world that even the renowned AI Village
[18:49:14] never
[18:49:16] reached should you be able to lay down a
[18:49:19] new stretch of silver rail the express
[18:49:22] may never have to worry about energy
[18:49:25] ever
[18:49:26] again trailblazing to a world that even
[18:49:30] Aki villy has never been to is that
[18:49:33] possible continue memoe keeper this
[18:49:36] destination of which you speak what sort
[18:49:39] of world is it to to
[18:49:43] that a world world that many Across the
[18:49:46] Universe we're going to ging
[18:49:49] exists a World hidden away from outside
[18:49:54] observation its presence only revealed
[18:49:57] by the light from the mirror of the
[18:49:59] garden of
[18:50:00] recollection a world fettered by three
[18:50:03] paths its Destiny hanging in the
[18:50:08] balance the Eternal land amorus
[18:50:18] I hope I'm not too late child oh well I
[18:50:21] guess that's where we're going 3.0 I

[18:58:59] bananas
[18:59:03] huh
[18:59:06] what the [ __ ] is this
[18:59:16] [Music]
[18:59:20] wait that's pretty cute is that a
[18:59:21] profile
[18:59:24] picture bet got a [ __ ] doll let's go
[18:59:29] damn I actually finished this Quest on
[18:59:31] time uh with that said I've been
[18:59:33] streaming for eight [ __ ] hours I've
[18:59:34] been tired for the last four sorry if
[18:59:36] I've been a bit out of it uh regarding
[18:59:38] the quest we just did the last like hour
[18:59:39] was really fun the first hour meeting
[18:59:41] with the economy director made me want
[18:59:43] to [ __ ] jump off the astral Express
[18:59:46] in game ah I didn't like that part but
[18:59:49] the rest was cool mixed feelings but I
[18:59:50] like I like the conclusion I still feel
[18:59:52] like there's some like plot lines that
[18:59:53] aren't finished at all so I assume we're
[18:59:55] going back to penone uh overall had a
[18:59:58] lot of fun I like penone a lot yeah now
[19:00:00] that penon is done well I think I mean
[19:00:02] temporarily done I had a lot of fun with
[19:00:04] it honestly I think I'm biased towards
[19:00:06] liking it more like I I think zag liked
[19:00:09] the [ __ ] first planet more but I I'm
[19:00:10] biased I like penoni quite a bit more
[19:00:13] not not because is necessarily better
[19:00:14] lorewise but I just had a better
[19:00:16] experience probably cuz I I'm biased to
[19:00:18] liking the characters a lot but yeah I
[19:00:20] liked it quite a bit bog was good I like
[19:00:23] the especially the co like the [ __ ]
[19:00:26] the buildup into the what's it called
[19:00:28] what's that song called whatever the pen
[19:00:30] the CIA fight I forget what the song's
[19:00:33] called Wildfire that's what it's called
[19:00:35] it was really good I wouldn't like when
[19:00:39] I did that I wasn't like wow this is I
[19:00:41] mean I I guess I did enjoy it I don't
[19:00:43] know recent bias too but I I like penak
[19:00:46] characters and aesthetic and also just
[19:00:48] the quest line quite a lot one my
[19:00:50] favorite so far but like I assume the
[19:00:53] future areas in quest are still going to
[19:00:55] be good so I don't think it's going to
[19:00:56] like stop being good at pentag I'm just
[19:00:58] I like these characters a lot so it's
[19:01:00] also more My Vibe than a lot of the well
[19:01:02] I mean I like the sanjo characters quite
[19:01:04] a bit bl's [ __ ] sick I don't know
[19:01:05] we'll see I mean even with like genin
[19:01:07] like sumaru was probably like my
[19:01:09] favorite but font 10 was [ __ ] in my
[19:01:11] opinion really really really good so
[19:01:13] it's not like it fell off we'll see like
[19:01:15] yeah I think I'm like the I'm a pretty
[19:01:17] big sumaru Glazer but I think Fontan was
[19:01:19] like on par with sumaru uh Sur is
[19:01:22] probably my favorite but I think the
[19:01:23] Fontan Quest was like very similar like
[19:01:25] like very good low attack blade EU okay
[19:01:28] don't talk to me you have never played
[19:01:29] honai star rail like font more
[19:01:31] character-wise H I might agree
[19:01:34] character-wise I like uh finina is
[19:01:36] probably my favorite archon it's either
[19:01:39] her or venty I don't know I like f a lot
[19:01:41] not an archon Al okay man that's [ __ ]
[19:01:45] um very scared about Natan I'm I'm
[19:01:47] worried they're going to make it
[19:01:48] terrible but I mean we'll see I mean I'm
[19:01:50] hopeful oh no I mean that's to be fair
[19:01:53] that's what I said about the last two
[19:01:54] regions and I've enjoyed both sumaru and
[19:01:56] Fontan but this one's a bit different
[19:01:58] we'll see like Fontan I thought it was
[19:02:00] going to suck cuz how the [ __ ] would you
[19:02:02] make Underwater Fun and to be fair like
[19:02:04] I'm not the biggest underwater fan but I
[19:02:06] think they made it better than I thought
[19:02:08] they would so pre and rock climb xdd
[19:02:11] font characters were really good yeah
[19:02:13] they were dude I think sumaru if only
[19:02:15] they made the archon not
[19:02:18] Nita like dude imagine if it was just
[19:02:20] greater Lord like we I don't know dude
[19:02:23] okay uh I should probably end it's
[19:02:24] [ __ ] late I'm tired m i mean I like
[19:02:26] Nita like I think she's cool but like I
[19:02:28] think they could have done better with
[19:02:30] like I think Su was Peak and I think a
[19:02:32] lot of the characters are really cool I
[19:02:33] just think imagine if Nita just wasn't a
[19:02:35] random [ __ ] stupid ass
[19:02:37] toddler okay sorry sorry sorry uh oh
[19:02:41] code's playing St let's read code [ __ ]
[19:02:42] it been a while haven't been stream in
[19:02:44] Forever it's lore relevant yeah I know
[19:02:46] it is I know like again like I like
[19:02:48] niita you're making it weird I mean not
[19:02:50] really Lord of dendro could be a [ __ ]
[19:02:52] shape-shifting Druid like it could be so
[19:02:54] much cooler of a concept than like w I
[19:02:57] have plants I'm a baby
[19:03:00] Aron like I like her like I played the
[19:03:02] quest like okay I like Nita but I just
[19:03:04] feel like visually like lur aside
[19:03:06] visually they could have made her cooler
[19:03:08] I think that's all but like again she's
[19:03:10] the one I I like the story a lot but
[19:03:13] yeah we're ending I'm just waiting for
[19:03:14] the raid to start
