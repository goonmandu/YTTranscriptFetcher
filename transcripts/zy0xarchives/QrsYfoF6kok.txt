[00:05:57] today uh like I have a few accounts that
[00:05:59] I want to review but I didn't like DM
[00:06:00] the people that have them so I can't do
[00:06:02] the account reviews today uh cuz I was
[00:06:04] busy as [ __ ] but it's fine next stream
[00:06:06] is probably going to be Soo today we
[00:06:08] prep Soo what does that mean what's
[00:06:10] going on guys what does that mean it
[00:06:12] means today we do the math that Soo
[00:06:15] needs to get him 90 double
[00:06:19] crowned uh and
[00:06:23] then is my cam
[00:06:26] unfocused oh my God why is it Abyss
[00:06:32] I don't work out today [ __ ] or yester uh
[00:06:34] I did yesterday
[00:06:41] actually all
[00:06:44] right but
[00:06:48] yeah dude s's normal attack Talent is
[00:06:51] literally nothing this is why would I
[00:06:52] Crown it just [ __ ] nothing I'll just
[00:06:54] double on it reactor signos Banner it's
[00:06:56] dog [ __ ] but the weapon B is really good
[00:06:59] weapon is insane I can show you
[00:07:07] guys how do you know I mean I saw
[00:07:13] it wait actually one
[00:07:20] sec let me pull up the soo Banner too
[00:07:31] yeah so let talk about your this Banner
[00:07:34] is uh I mean bro it's [ __ ] I don't
[00:07:39] know
[00:07:40] like yeah like saou is sa is saou kie is
[00:07:46] okay Candace is we don't know but
[00:07:48] probably going to be
[00:07:51] um anyways and then Coo's [ __ ] sick
[00:07:54] but like for the four stars I'm not too
[00:07:56] happy uh but whatever we'll see and then
[00:07:58] we this is [ __ ] insane this we bner
[00:08:01] this is this is probably the best weap B
[00:08:04] we've ever had I know like hom Banner
[00:08:06] like hom El or whatever the [ __ ] or or
[00:08:08] like hom banners have been
[00:08:10] good uh or like the aqua Banner was good
[00:08:14] but like this is
[00:08:16] insane assuming you want sino's weapon
[00:08:19] cuz El is really good on a lot of
[00:08:21] support B characters and then this the
[00:08:23] um sans's spear is like really good for
[00:08:27] Soo and then though four stars are also
[00:08:30] really good cuz you have fav bow which
[00:08:32] is [ __ ] broken fav Lance which is
[00:08:34] arguably the best well Lance and sword
[00:08:36] I'd say are like I mean they're all good
[00:08:37] but fa Lance is insane cuz like so many
[00:08:40] spear characters can use a fav weapon
[00:08:41] like Jang Le Rosaria and a bunch of
[00:08:43] other supports
[00:08:46] uh yeah and then Lions roar I mean I
[00:08:50] guess there's not that many but yeah
[00:08:51] them and then Lions Roar is decent sack
[00:08:53] frags is good and new Claymore which I
[00:08:55] forget but yeah
[00:09:06] go away env's backup
[00:09:09] nut yeah so we man is insane character
[00:09:11] Banner uh you know it is what it is sa's
[00:09:15] mid uh kookie's kookie's like decent I
[00:09:18] think kookie's a pretty okay unit now
[00:09:20] like she's pretty good but not like
[00:09:22] amazing and then Candace we don't know
[00:09:24] uh I've heard Z Jeff not happy about
[00:09:27] Candace but I mean know you didn't get
[00:09:30] bobber he's far I don't feel like
[00:09:32] getting up cuz I'm tired but I'll go get
[00:09:33] him in a bit crispy thanks 100 bits I
[00:09:36] apologize to Don
[00:09:46] W you make it right
[00:09:49] sorry uh but this webar is [ __ ]
[00:09:52] insane I'm pulling on it for sure uh
[00:09:54] because I want lgy for showcases and
[00:09:56] like testing and testing like there's a
[00:09:58] few character like I haven't played elgy
[00:10:00] Amber with Hut like there's a lot of
[00:10:02] things I want to do that I can't so I
[00:10:04] need elgy and I also need sino's weapon
[00:10:06] because I'm number one Soo fan so we're
[00:10:08] going to get both um with that said do I

[00:56:18] quick Bloom so you do like Barbara fabra
[00:56:21] and then you would run like Electro
[00:56:23] dendro but we'll see we'll test him when
[00:56:25] he comes out tomorrow

[01:41:43] somewhere do na Talent is useless uh I
[01:41:47] don't think we know officially but I'm
[01:41:49] pretty sure it
[01:41:51] is shake it and I'm pretty sure it's
[01:41:54] burst kind of like
[01:41:55] Ryden my apologies embrace the except
[01:41:59] going to work with bet cuz it's not
[01:42:00] poorly
[01:42:05] designed swirling
[01:42:09] [Music]
[01:42:17] snow my apologies
[01:42:29] I want Soo but I want Shia more so
[01:42:30] skipping Soo honestly what you could do
[01:42:33] now don't tell anyone I said this is get
[01:42:36] Soo and then obtain uh this five star
[01:42:39] material called a credit card and then
[01:42:41] also get CH I mean yeah play things in
[01:42:44] two months good morning although it is
[01:42:46] night for me
[01:42:53] think you can pully me hold the
[01:42:57] line
[01:43:00] coming dude I [ __ ] hate these
[01:43:06] enemies all I'll just wa for my burst
[01:43:11] again take
[01:43:15] flight and rebuild
[01:43:23] what if I don't have such a Godly
[01:43:26] item uh unfortunate you're playing
[01:43:30] you're playing gen back hard
[01:43:44] mode all right let's go kets dude I hate
[01:43:48] how far the crafting table is in sumu
[01:43:59] T got on release day probably yeah or
[01:44:02] one day after I'll have it pre-recorded
[01:44:04] but I like waiting before uploading it
[01:44:06] just to make sure it's
[01:44:07] quality um but Soo seems very
[01:44:10] simple um genuinely the only hard part
[01:44:13] about Soo is his attack Combos and
[01:44:15] making sure you use your skill at the
[01:44:17] right time um but I'm like we've mostly
[01:44:19] figured it
[01:44:21] out and like your combo varies if you're
[01:44:24] running TF or not because TF uh changes
[01:44:26] your skill cool down right so on a
[01:44:29] character that wants to spam their skill
[01:44:31] yeah but we'll see can you bark for my
[01:44:34] grandpa
[01:44:36] no but I wish him the best
[01:44:53] [Music]
[01:45:00] can you meow
[01:45:03] instead DMC decent with Soo DMC is the
[01:45:07] best option for any dender team you want
[01:45:08] to make ever unless you need an on field
[01:45:11] then like TI can sometimes be better uh
[01:45:14] for like yeah on field [ __ ] but usually
[01:45:17] DMC is like the go-to right now until we
[01:45:19] get new dendo characters so yes it is
[01:45:22] worth however uh in like an
[01:45:25] aggravate like Sino team for example do
[01:45:28] you really need your dendro main
[01:45:29] character to be 90 if you're not proing
[01:45:31] reactions on the D main character not
[01:45:33] necessarily allow
[01:45:40] me like if your dendo main character is
[01:45:42] on like [ __ ] nobless fav with like
[01:45:45] Nega -2
[01:45:47] damage but
[01:45:50] yeah wait my e wore off I don't know why
[01:45:52] I bursted that was D dude they're just
[01:45:53] not grouping it's so
[01:45:56] weird like I know how to stun them but

[01:47:02] uh I don't have that many
[01:47:05] though 963 yeah I know but then I also

[01:47:43] Crowns normal attacks are irrelevant I'm
[01:47:46] pretty
[01:47:48] sure unless I misunderstood his talents
[01:47:50] normal T should be irrelevant so
[01:47:56] bring

[01:50:46] good stat sck cuz you don't care about
[01:50:48] base attack that
[01:50:50] much but H is going to be better

[02:11:00] noticed yeah probably I'm sorry that's
[02:11:03] just how my brain
[02:11:09] works I'm sorry I can't control what I
[02:11:11] read it's just
[02:11:16] natural what team were we running
[02:11:36] win stri [ __ ] I thought I was on I
[02:11:39] thought I was on
[02:11:41] Kaza the bird's
[02:11:47] Cal can't see
[02:12:00] disappear why is my sh doing negative
[02:12:02] damage oh never mind it was just elra
[02:12:04] thing
[02:12:10] worthless you also think Oz is kind of
[02:12:12] hot or is it just
[02:12:14] me uh I mean his voice is kind of hot
[02:12:17] but it's also he's a bird bro as one
[02:12:21] with wind and Cloud the wind knows okay
[02:12:25] don't type huh the that's if anything
[02:12:27] I'm just complimenting the voice actor I
[02:12:29] don't think Oz himself is it's a [ __ ]
[02:12:31] bird okay calm the [ __ ] down don't type
[02:12:34] huh I'm just saying his voice is kind of
[02:12:36] gigachad look at
[02:12:49] me wow I I can love this
[02:12:59] domain is insos scaling with em how do
[02:13:02] you know that how
[02:13:05] uh how would you know that how did you
[02:13:08] come to that conclusion that's all
[02:13:10] that's all I wonder is how you came how
[02:13:13] did you come to that conclusion tell me
[02:13:17] ow are you
[02:13:22] but yeah uh realistically he's probably
[02:13:24] going to be built like aggravate kaching
[02:13:26] so em or attack hands and everything
[02:13:30] else is going to be the [ __ ] same uh
[02:13:32] except probably going to scale more with
[02:13:34] em than kaching why shut up I can't tell
[02:13:36] you but probably uh just assuming from
[02:13:40] how his design
[02:13:42] looks yeah from the weapon that's how we
[02:13:46] assume I mean if you run the weapon
[02:13:48] you're going to want em SS for sure but
[02:13:49] let's say you run a weapon with a High
[02:13:51] base attack like Jade spear there's a
[02:13:53] decent chance that attack Sands becomes
[02:13:55] similar in strength than an EM1 does
[02:13:57] that make
[02:14:10] sense the wind

[02:28:07] all right do we do it chat do we strong
[02:28:09] Cox yo subie thanks for wait did I see
[02:28:12] this gifted already I can't tell you've
[02:28:13] gifted so many thanks for another gifted
[02:28:15] though it actually means a lot
[02:28:20] you hear Maniac by Straight kids yeah I
[02:28:22] like
[02:28:42] it I don't get
[02:28:45] it all
[02:28:48] right do I do
[02:28:55] chat what if I record an introduction in
[02:28:58] case in case this is
[02:29:02] poggers all right
[02:29:05] listen my last strong Box video for Soo
[02:29:09] TF Thunder furry did really well so I
[02:29:12] might make another but I kind of want to
[02:29:14] save up as many artifacts as I can
[02:29:15] before I do it however I'm impatient and
[02:29:19] have like 50 fragile I want to use so
[02:29:22] what we're probably going to do is just
[02:29:24] strong box right now and then see if we
[02:29:26] got good [ __ ] and then after we'll just
[02:29:29] do more strong block and we'll like
[02:29:30] bring them into one video so it's going
[02:29:33] to it'll be like 500 to 1,000 artifacts
[02:29:36] in one video but we're going to
[02:29:37] compartmentalize it compart split into
[02:29:41] multiple and then condense it into one
[02:29:43] so like what you see now isn't all the
[02:29:45] artifacts but it's like some of them
[02:29:47] does that make sense
[02:29:50] type balls in chat if that made
[02:29:53] sense anyways we're just going to strong
[02:29:55] box and then see what happens and then
[02:29:57] we're going to use a lot of resin
[02:30:00] poggers this also might never be a video
[02:30:02] I don't know but we'll see how good this
[02:30:05] is okay chat you guys haven't gambled
[02:30:07] all day so I'll let you gamble you guys
[02:30:09] can
[02:30:11] predict will we
[02:30:14] get what do I even gamble on what do I
[02:30:17] need [ __ ] no what do I actually need
[02:30:20] okay wait let's look let's look let's
[02:30:21] look okay so for Soo I wait is my cookie
[02:30:24] Nazi
[02:30:25] too damn unlucky

[02:31:11] that anyways new Gamba uh what piece do
[02:31:14] I need for sinusi so if I decide to run
[02:31:17] glad I need an em Sans but we're doing
[02:31:19] TF right so what do I need for the
[02:31:21] Thundering
[02:31:22] Fury but to be fair TF makes you do less
[02:31:26] n5s and N5 is so [ __ ] cool on Soo so
[02:31:29] I kind of want to run glad just cuz it's
[02:31:31] so cool to N5 that running TF is just
[02:31:34] cringe but it's also lowkey optimal uh I
[02:31:37] kind of need a better sand or a better
[02:31:40] goblet or ciret
[02:31:53] okay we're
[02:31:54] gonna we're we're going to do guys we're

[02:32:08] good TF piece for our Soo which one
[02:32:11] either an amazing Elemental Mastery
[02:32:13] Sands or an amazing ciret we have an
[02:32:15] amazing ciret but it's crit rate and we
[02:32:18] probably want a crit damage ciret for
[02:32:19] our ratio so we're going for either
[02:32:22] amazing em Sands or amazing crit damage
[02:32:24] circlet or amazing Electro goblet
[02:32:30] or so either of those would

[02:43:57] of copium but most of them are good
[02:43:58] trust watch look at this feather
[02:44:01] actually let's start with the the worst
[02:44:02] ones so like this sucks unless it gets
[02:44:04] crit damage pretty
[02:44:11] much
[02:44:16] unlucky
[02:44:18] um [ __ ] it we'll do our feathers I
[02:44:22] guess I don't want to waste my MOA
[02:44:24] though I also don't have much artifact
[02:44:26] XP so we should probably Chuck a plus 20
[02:44:28] piece in
[02:44:30] here what's my worst
[02:44:34] feather what is my worst feather
[02:45:00] dump the physical goblet all
[02:45:02] right what's the worst that can
[02:45:07] happen not
[02:45:10] bad dude actually not bad if it rolls CR
[02:45:13] damage again uh I could have like 30
[02:45:16] something like 33 34 imagine 34 crit
[02:45:21] damage 34 crit damage I give five
[02:45:25] Subs hey not 34 but hey we take
[02:45:29] that okay sure I mean that's [ __ ]
[02:45:31] good that's actually oh dude if it only
[02:45:33] if only it didn't hit flat defense but
[02:45:35] hey it's still really good I thought it
[02:45:37] is dark Union good aloy off piece it's
[02:45:40] not an aloy piece
[02:45:49] we'll just keep this be locked we won't
[02:45:50] level it
[02:45:54] yet the only problem with that piece I
[02:45:56] keep yelling you I'm so [ __ ] tired is
[02:45:58] that we don't have artifact
[02:46:03] XP oh pause jamp pause to jamp TJ
[02:46:16] amp wait okay first two questions first
[02:46:20] of all what the [ __ ] second of all are
[02:46:22] the is it just me or are these all
[02:46:23] really low
[02:46:36] rolls it's fine uh low rolls plus Mist
[02:46:39] it's not worth I mean it's not bad but
[02:46:41] we already have such good like it's
[02:46:43] still not bad this isn't bad but we
[02:46:44] already have such good feathers that if
[02:46:46] I level another one I'm actually going
[02:46:47] to want to Minecraft myself so we're not
[02:46:50] leveling this but it's not bad uh we'll
[02:46:53] might as well level this cuz who
[02:47:01] knows [ __ ] okay it's actually good uh I

[03:26:37] slaps Sino yeah Soo probably next stream
[03:26:41] cuz tomorrow I'm uploading kaching guide
[03:26:42] and I'm recording the soo video cuz yeah
[03:26:46] uh um so probably next stream which is
[03:26:48] in two like after tomorrow Soo so expect
[03:26:52] me to be live for soo's
[03:26:55] release that's far
[03:27:00] [Music]
[03:27:02] enough I B is
[03:27:12] strong you see a Jeff tweet yeah I was
[03:27:14] pretty based
[03:27:17] all right I don't want to stall but I
[03:27:19] don't know I always like streaming cuz
[03:27:20] you guys are [ __ ] cool so thanks for
[03:27:21] being here I'll try to stream as much as
[03:27:22] I can can video actually out tomorrow
[03:27:25] it's like so delayed but it actually
[03:27:26] will be uh I want to try to like Omega
[03:27:29] oh guys wait before we go before we go
[03:27:31] this is important I was looking at some
[03:27:32] accounts to review and there you guys
[03:27:35] submitted so many so I couldn't look at
[03:27:36] all of them but I looked at a few and I
[03:27:38] found some that seemed pretty POG trap
[03:27:40] uh there was this one that I was
[03:27:41] debating reviewing cuz it's kind of like
[03:27:44] it's not bad but like like the ratios
[03:27:48] are kind of
[03:27:49] scuffed um not on every character but
[03:27:51] like like fishal has 29 crit rate and
[03:27:53] like Shang Ling's kind of scuffed but
[03:27:56] like it also has potential cuz there's
[03:27:57] like a lot of interesting weapons you
[03:27:58] can use and there's like interesting
[03:28:00] character choice to where there's like
[03:28:03] actually seems like decent content
[03:28:05] there's also this one but this one was
[03:28:07] like um I don't remember I think the
[03:28:09] description of it was good the pictures
[03:28:11] don't show that much but also the Ryden
[03:28:13] has wait no wait which account was I
[03:28:14] thinking of there's account that r with
[03:28:16] like 10 crit rate was it this
[03:28:19] one yeah this one has 19 [ __ ] crit
[03:28:22] rate so I don't know like there's a few
[03:28:23] you can do this one I like cuz you can
[03:28:25] make a dendro team out of it make
[03:28:26] aggravate King and uh there's a few ways
[03:28:29] to fix it this one was in a Google Drive
[03:28:32] which is pretty [ __ ] I can't
[03:28:39] um but there's also a lot of like
[03:28:41] underinvestment I like this one it's
[03:28:43] just the problem is I don't think I'd
[03:28:44] make them a dendro team and I kind of
[03:28:45] want my
[03:28:46] my first sumu counterview to have a enro
[03:28:48] team with DMC whereas with this team it
[03:28:51] would probably be like Ryden National
[03:28:53] and then IA freeze so why would I use uh
[03:28:56] dendro right if you have R in national
[03:28:58] AA freeze unless the Shang Ling is like
[03:29:01] not good at
[03:29:03] all yeah like I'd probably just do
[03:29:05] rational and then aka which is fine but
[03:29:09] I feel like I kind of want to make a
[03:29:10] dendro
[03:29:11] team like sugro salad um to start sug
[03:29:16] solad or aggravate
[03:29:20] Kain so all right I'll figure it out
[03:29:23] hopefully next stream has an account
[03:29:24] review though cuz it's content and I
[03:29:26] want to give z a video to work on in the
[03:29:28] background uh and then I'll probably do
[03:29:30] a
[03:29:32] C6 Soo review but I'm not C6 I'm just
