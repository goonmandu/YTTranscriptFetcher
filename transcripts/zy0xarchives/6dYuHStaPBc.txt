[00:16:13] I just like lay in bed and then it's
[00:16:15] like 11:00 p.m. and I'm like damn this
[00:16:16] day is gone so whatever um I will say
[00:16:19] though holy this chat's moving fast I
[00:16:21] will say though um how do I open my
[00:16:23] YouTube
[00:16:25] channel this chori video for some reason
[00:16:29] made me set to like 8:00 a.m. cuz I'm f
[00:16:32] [ __ ]
[00:16:33] degenerate uh which was annoying like I
[00:16:37] love sh like you know that's on me but
[00:16:39] took um it didn't even take longer than
[00:16:41] most she's just albo but it's like why
[00:16:43] did it I don't know I feel like I was
[00:16:45] stalling like I was just unproductive
[00:16:46] like I was I do this thing I don't know
[00:16:50] what this is called procrastination I
[00:16:52] guess but
[00:16:54] um literally like I I did like 99% of it
[00:16:57] and then the last like I guess like 3%
[00:16:59] 97 took like a year 900 gold books
[00:17:04] yeah dude the Spectrum Ms are more
[00:17:09] impressive but
[00:17:10] anyways um fell off no character
[00:17:15] character guides uh well I'm not an
[00:17:18] analytics Andy but they do as well as
[00:17:19] the character is right so if you look at
[00:17:21] like finina she has a million because
[00:17:23] she's really hyped like that's mostly
[00:17:25] how good the character is or how popular
[00:17:27] they are
[00:17:30] it's always like
[00:17:32] that but yeah so like
[00:17:36] arino I will
[00:17:39] um you
[00:17:44] know I'll be ready for SAS okay I have
[00:17:47] to talk about Aro dude I am afraid so me
[00:17:51] personally when I like a character I
[00:17:53] don't want them to be like the strongest
[00:17:55] or the most broken because then everyone
[00:17:58] uses them and like I'm not like
[00:17:59] gatekeeping but I don't want someone to
[00:18:00] use a character I like just be okay this
[00:18:02] is like really weird but like I don't
[00:18:05] want to tell people to pull for a
[00:18:07] character that I think is really cool
[00:18:08] just because they're good and not
[00:18:10] because they're cool I don't know how to
[00:18:11] explain it's not gay it's like okay if I
[00:18:14] play a competitive game and everyone's
[00:18:16] playing this [ __ ] cringe ass
[00:18:18] overpowered character I'm going to be
[00:18:19] like this character is stupid I hate
[00:18:20] them so if there's like sha for example
[00:18:23] he's really good and he's really cool
[00:18:24] and I want everyone to experience him
[00:18:25] but I don't want people to pull for him
[00:18:27] just because
[00:18:29] he's like the best character in the game
[00:18:30] which he isn't I don't know anyways
[00:18:33] regarding arino though this isn't about
[00:18:35] her that's a bad take well in genin it
[00:18:37] doesn't matter because everyone can play
[00:18:38] the same character and it doesn't matter
[00:18:39] this is just how I feel about
[00:18:41] like uh like okay actually let me reword
[00:18:45] this uh I don't want a character to be
[00:18:48] so broken or so dog [ __ ] if I really
[00:18:51] like them because then it's like I feel
[00:18:53] like I have to use them or I feel like I
[00:18:55] can't use them when I really like them
[00:18:57] and I would use them either way it
[00:18:59] doesn't matter like this isn't about
[00:19:01] other people it's about me like I don't
[00:19:02] care if you play them I don't care if
[00:19:04] this is just how I feel about it it's
[00:19:05] not like no one should respect my
[00:19:07] opinion I don't care I'm just saying
[00:19:08] that's how I feel about it
[00:19:10] uh regarding characters like AR Lino
[00:19:13] though that are really
[00:19:17] um that are this
[00:19:21] hyped it's kind of
[00:19:23] gatekeeping
[00:19:26] uh okay then let me re explain it
[00:19:29] let me re-explain it I don't care who
[00:19:31] you pull for and I will give you meta
[00:19:33] advice the most that I can but as far as
[00:19:35] like me liking a
[00:19:37] character historically throughout my
[00:19:39] life in every game I've played I don't
[00:19:41] like playing the one thing that
[00:19:43] everyone's like you have to play this
[00:19:44] it's the most broken thing ever it just
[00:19:46] it I don't know why but for me it's like
[00:19:48] yeah I'll play it like I play Shang Ling
[00:19:50] all the time but it's not
[00:19:53] like it's dude I don't know I don't know
[00:19:56] I don't know how to say it I don't know
[00:19:58] I don't no nothing wrong with that
[00:20:01] contrarian no it's not contrarian like I
[00:20:03] won't go out my way to say something
[00:20:05] that that like something unpopular in
[00:20:07] fact I usually like follow Trends and
[00:20:09] I'm I'm you know but it's like I don't
[00:20:12] okay example a good example is like
[00:20:14] nevet I really like nlet but he's so
[00:20:16] broken that sometimes I play him and I'm
[00:20:18] like dude like this isn't even like
[00:20:19] what's H like they're just dead like I'm
[00:20:21] just sitting here hydrop pumping I'm
[00:20:23] like barely enjoying myself and they're
[00:20:25] dead and like will I tell you to pull
[00:20:28] from Absol absolutely get him he he if
[00:20:30] you're struggling to clearly this get
[00:20:31] him get him get him he's good and he he
[00:20:34] has a massive
[00:20:35] hydroco like I think he's great and I
[00:20:37] use him a lot of times when let's say
[00:20:38] I'm trying to Showcase a character other
[00:20:40] half boom never let or like I'll height
[00:20:41] them but as far as like personal
[00:20:44] enjoyment I get bored when the character
[00:20:46] is like a lot better than what I'm used
[00:20:47] to I don't know why that's just me
[00:20:49] that's not a bad thing though unless
[00:20:50] it's like competitive like if I'm
[00:20:52] playing to like race my friend I'll you
[00:20:54] bet your [ __ ] COA I'm going to use
[00:20:56] net well my sh is better but you know
[00:20:58] what I'm saying saying that that just it
[00:21:01] doesn't matter I'm not I'm not the
[00:21:02] [ __ ] gospel I'm just saying my
[00:21:05] thoughts anyways
[00:21:08] um regarding
[00:21:12] arino okay I have to say something dude
[00:21:16] I good evening you only
[00:21:19] here dude okay before Navia came out my
[00:21:23] timeline was heavily Navia now it's
[00:21:25] literally entirely arino I'm trying to
[00:21:29] avoid it I try not to look at leaks I
[00:21:31] don't talk about leaks bro they're
[00:21:34] everywhere look
[00:21:38] um for obvious reasons you know I don't
[00:21:40] want to get copyright stried I don't
[00:21:41] want to get uh Angry
[00:21:44] messages we don't talk about leaks uh
[00:21:48] but I'm like I I've been trying my
[00:21:51] hardest not to look I swear okay but I
[00:21:54] will say that this will be a little bit
[00:21:56] like it won't be porn acting okay I'll
[00:21:58] tell you what I saw once we see it and
[00:22:00] what I what I didn't see because I've
[00:22:02] been trying not to look okay I've been
[00:22:03] trying not to look but I need you to
[00:22:05] understand that it's everywhere and I
[00:22:07] don't want to mute her name cuz like you

[00:22:53] it have I ever told you about Arc of the
[00:22:55] Scythe one of my favorite Sci-Fi series
[00:22:58] anyways I love sides I'm like dude look
[00:23:02] I so for me it's like I [ __ ] love
[00:23:06] sides so if I ever see a scythe in genin
[00:23:08] I'm G to scream but if I see it off
[00:23:11] stream and then I I'm streaming and then
[00:23:14] they like there's a scythe then I'm like
[00:23:16] I I have to like fake the reaction I had
[00:23:18] when I was
[00:23:23] anyways I mean like yeah like for nevet
[00:23:26] for example this one I talked about
[00:23:29] uh I knew he had like a hydrop pump but
[00:23:31] I didn't know he could like float and
[00:23:32] like I didn't see the animations so then
[00:23:33] when I saw on live stream I was like oh
[00:23:34] [ __ ] what the [ __ ] and then chat was
[00:23:36] like porn acting [ __ ] I didn't
[00:23:39] know anyways um Let me let me show you
[00:23:42] guys something really fast from
[00:23:49] Zio okay I just searched
[00:23:53] something I searched from
[00:23:56] Z has
[00:23:59] Scythe just because 2021 can you imagine
[00:24:03] how sick would be to have a
[00:24:04] scythe January Scythe next 2023 weget an
[00:24:09] Ask get a scythe
[00:24:11] num
[00:24:16] 2022 you're so bad at wording [ __ ] [ __ ]

[00:24:52] have like 10 like I actually was like
[00:24:54] that edgy 13-year-old I'm not joking
[00:25:00] anyways uh completely unrelated to sides
[00:25:04] AR Lino completely unrelated um I'm a
[00:25:08] bit afraid because I'm very hype about
[00:25:10] her and I really like her design but I'm
[00:25:13] afraid that if there's anything there's
[00:25:16] certain characters that are so hyped
[00:25:17] that they have to be good or if you
[00:25:19] criticize them you go to jail so I'm
[00:25:22] going to hope that she's good because if
[00:25:24] not I will go to
[00:25:27] jail
[00:25:29] bro thinks he's
[00:25:40] Kane

[01:33:02] better D how would I know I'm
[01:33:06] sorry ourc father is the
[01:33:09] prime excuse me okay but but look at
[01:33:12] 1010 1010 Sing
[01:33:19] trro Sing CHS is one of
[01:33:22] the he said s
[01:33:25] choose most broken characters in genjin
[01:33:29] Impact like being only a fourstar
[01:33:31] character it's it's perfect wait is
[01:33:34] it without question the national team is
[01:33:37] one of Skin's strongest team despite
[01:33:40] using only fourstar character this is
[01:33:43] how I play it mostly damn I didn't one
[01:33:45] shot
[01:33:46] him am I using wait wait yo what are you
[01:33:52] doing
[01:33:57] Oh wrong National Opa you know that was
[01:34:00] what the original National was right
[01:34:02] I've talked about this
[01:34:06] before I remember I vividly remember
[01:34:09] playing this team with sucros but like
[01:34:12] the national team was with trong Yun and
[01:34:13] I was like why the [ __ ] would you use
[01:34:14] trong Yun and I was like okay maybe I'm
[01:34:16] dumb
[01:34:22] byways
[01:34:33] he's stalling again dude I was just
[01:34:35] correct I was I was just national team
[01:34:37] is one of Skin's strongest team despite
[01:34:40] using only four star character this is
[01:34:43] how I play it mostly Dam I didn't one
[01:34:45] shot
[01:34:46] him am I using wait wait or venti the
[01:34:53] basic of this team includes stacking
[01:34:54] buff and then snapshotting it all onto
[01:34:56] Shing element okay I have to pee so bad
[01:34:59] I'm going to let you guys watch this I
[01:35:00] [ __ ] it and do great price damage on
[01:35:02] Shang Ling making sure that you cast all
[01:35:05] buff before using shanling burst such as
[01:35:07] sross Benet or four no bullet and
[01:35:10] Etc Also if anyone need to ask
[01:35:13] snapshotting is not removed it before we
[01:35:17] dive into the rotation we're going to be
[01:35:19] referring characters Elemental skill as
[01:35:21] their e and characters Elemental burst
[01:35:23] as as their Q as those are the key bind
[01:35:25] for the PC version of genin impact we're
[01:35:28] going to be breaking the rotation into
[01:35:29] two part and we're going to start with
[01:35:31] the opening do you know that we're going
[01:35:34] to be doing a singi Elemental burst
[01:35:36] first and then doing sing Elemental
[01:35:37] skills which is singi qill we do Q on S
[01:35:41] because C4 let us get 50% more damage
[01:35:44] and this is a 50% multiplier that is
[01:35:46] separate from any other multiplier in
[01:35:48] the game if you're using saur and singu
[01:35:50] you'll be doing q y instead and if you
[01:35:53] do not have consolation 4 then you can
[01:35:56] do EQ or you can do EQ if you have sck
[01:35:59] sword starting off with the K version
[01:36:01] we're going to start with Benet Q into k
[01:36:03] e for a quick melt and then back to
[01:36:05] Benet e and into Q E for a quick k for a
[01:36:10] and then CH E autoq into a Common
[01:36:13] Rotation be sure to stick on the mob so
[01:36:15] that your kak can apply
[01:36:19] cryo that was 8 seconds I pee fast

[02:09:15] enemies Le
[02:09:18] ad
[02:09:20] silence
[02:09:25] wait what the [ __ ] am I fighting oh I
[02:09:27] didn't know that thing counted as an
[02:09:28] enemy I thought it was like a summon
[02:09:29] like you like in like a star raal boss
[02:09:31] fight you know they like summon like a
[02:09:32] little minion I thought it was like a
[02:09:33] little
[02:09:34] minion oh okay okay 412 I'm going to I
[02:09:38] didn't actually check the enemy list
[02:09:39] before starting the only thing is I like
[02:09:41] was 99% sure they're going to put a wolf
[02:09:43] Lord with EO and apparently there's none
[02:09:45] but I didn't look at the enemies so
[02:09:46] let's look at the enemies there's the
[02:09:47] [ __ ] stupid chicken [ __ ] but that's
[02:09:49] okay um oh sorry wait no no swearing for
[02:09:52] the YouTube there's this stupid chicken
[02:09:55] Frick uh Frost operative wind operative
[02:09:58] this looks annoying but it looks very
[02:09:59] easy for Shia so I'm happy second half
[02:10:01] looks like single Target probably a boss
[02:10:03] second is probably boss thing uh very
[02:10:05] good for Shia thank [ __ ] PM second half
[02:10:08] freak you PMA is cool 121 122 uh suck my
[02:10:12] balls but it's okay
[02:10:16] 123 what the [ __ ] is this wait is this
[02:10:19] the thing that lets you punch what the
[02:10:21] [ __ ] is a veteran arithm enhancer
[02:10:26] Mech is that the plunge
[02:10:29] [ __ ]
[02:10:36] [ __ ] capellia is the is that the girl
[02:10:40] the
[02:10:46] dancer oh yeah cuz the guy's capellas
[02:10:48] [ __ ] you man why you give me one good
[02:10:52] show Abyss in the last like five years
[02:10:55] then oh really good for show oh really
[02:10:57] good for show anemo
[02:10:59] resistant w w w
[02:11:03] w Wait low key I could sh a second half
[02:11:06] too
[02:11:15] though first chamber two well it's just
[02:11:17] the wind operative that is I know she is
[02:11:20] resistant but like who if it's one enemy
[02:11:22] this looks AOE if it's AOE and you're
[02:11:23] plunging everything The Last Enemy
[02:11:25] lasting a bit longer is not the H it's
[02:11:27] annoying but it it's less annoying than
[02:11:30] this
[02:11:32] [ __ ] okay we'll probably play chori cuz
[02:11:35] she's new somewhere but first half I
[02:11:37] think we're doing uh
[02:11:40] sha second
[02:11:46] half uh probably like couta or some
[02:11:49] [ __ ] Navia we could play Navia I think
[02:11:53] my Navia is pretty well geared but my
[02:11:54] Navia needs finina she's on Mary Hunter
[02:11:56] and I want the finina on the first half
[02:11:58] with that said I could also Ben
[02:12:01] 10 instead of
[02:12:12] [Music]
[02:12:17] finina Navia chori finina
[02:12:22] uh wait this team wants finina and
[02:12:25] Bennett or shenyun man [ __ ] this team uh
[02:12:29] we'll do a different healer
[02:12:30] then [ __ ] I actually I don't want to
[02:12:33] play
[02:12:42] Gan
[02:12:50] Ma
[02:12:56] okay if I'm try Harding I probably just
[02:12:57] put like nevet or I'll height them
[02:12:59] somewhere right this guy's dendro
[02:13:06] resistant no that's probably good first
[02:13:09] half can I sha second sha would [ __ ]
[02:13:12] that guy up sha would [ __ ] that guy
[02:13:15] up sh would probably [ __ ] that guy up
[02:13:17] too
[02:13:20] right I know Shia's like an AOE DPS but
[02:13:22] with Shan Yun he's actually pretty good
[02:13:24] in single
[02:13:34] Target you need Gio or Claymore I don't
[02:13:36] know what the enemy is but most if it's
[02:13:38] a if this enemy has a shield plunge
[02:13:40] attacks can break it cuz plunge attacks
[02:13:42] are considered heavy attacks kind of
[02:13:43] like Claymores so you you whatever if
[02:13:45] there is a shield like that you can
[02:13:46] break
[02:13:50] it
[02:13:55] all right let's do
[02:13:58] it hardest challenge don't play sh we're
[02:14:00] making the challenge hard by not using a
[02:14:01] shield so that we can gamble on if I'll
[02:14:03] clear first try or not and every time I
[02:14:05] fail it it's called blunt freck
[02:14:11] you but yeah dude the blunt is such a
[02:14:14] [ __ ] word though I'm sorry or like
[02:14:20] poise
[02:14:30] um sh let's place this in the order I'm
[02:14:33] going to use them so it'll be shenyun
[02:14:35] last finina before
[02:14:38] her and
[02:14:40] farizon
[02:14:43] um
[02:14:46] oh
[02:14:49] W sorry um if I want to make sure I
[02:14:52] don't die I go wrly but we're not going
[02:14:53] to do that first half we're going to
[02:14:54] play yeah yeah yeah yeah probably nette
[02:14:58] if I'm a TR sweaty tryhard loser but I'm
[02:15:01] not so we're going to play dude capellia
[02:15:04] [ __ ] me up every time I always die to
[02:15:10] her
[02:15:19] um
[02:15:23] the song is not even playing what do you
[02:15:25] mean is it too
[02:15:28] quiet use chori
[02:15:32] wege Gio looks like a second half thing
[02:15:34] not a first half
[02:15:47] thing man there's no team I want to play
[02:15:49] Maybe [ __ ] Soo
[02:15:52] I don't
[02:16:13] know this [ __ ] looks like it needs Kaza
[02:16:15] I'm sorry whatever team we play first
[02:16:17] half Kaza is coming dude these things
[02:16:19] look [ __ ] annoying um we want
[02:16:22] something that's good against
[02:16:27] capellia honestly we could hyper
[02:16:31] Bloom oh
[02:16:49] [ __ ]
[02:17:05] thoughts
[02:17:07] no dude this looks so [ __ ] I don't want
[02:17:10] to play any okay maybe we just never let
[02:17:12] [ __ ]

[02:17:20] kazua and then like swirl this garbage

[02:17:58] hard to [ __ ] like yolan is broken it
[02:18:01] has to be
[02:18:04] fine like there's no way yolan [ __ ]

[02:39:22] make our
[02:39:28] teams so what would our forer teams be
[02:39:31] oh we can open the we got the art the
[02:39:34] golden artifact boxes we're going to
[02:39:35] open those as
[02:39:38] well um for our teams I think we play 16
[02:39:41] 18 and Hyper blo if you don't know what
[02:39:43] 1618
[02:39:44] is yeah I'll think so 5 months if you
[02:39:46] don't know what 1618 is it is a reverse
[02:39:48] mouth quick swap team very fun very good
[02:39:51] uh is it even good here it looks good
[02:39:58] here yeah it's probably
[02:40:02] good so what the team is is it's
[02:40:05] Rosaria Kaa strangling bet it second
[02:40:08] half I think we
[02:40:10] play this thing's resistant to
[02:40:13] dendro but surely it's still hyper Bloom
[02:40:18] right wait does hyper even break this I
[02:40:21] guess with
[02:40:22] bet wait is it ever hyper Bloom first
[02:40:24] half am I griefing if I go hyper Blom
[02:40:28] first fishal will
[02:40:31] carry yeah fishal does carry but doesn't
[02:40:34] fal's A4 doesn't work against PMA but I
[02:40:37] guess it works against Jade
[02:40:40] plume you know BET's dumb cuz single
[02:40:42] Target yeah is there a good Claymore for
[02:40:45] hyper Bloom I guess I could just Spam

[03:26:51] like usually like it's either a meme ban

[03:26:56] it's like some someone sing over a
[03:26:57] [ __ ] like child and they stay banned
[03:26:59] It's usually the only two things that
[03:27:00] get like it's rare that
[03:27:03] like people don't usually get banned for
[03:27:05] like other
[03:27:12] stuff like nightbot will time people out

[03:45:27] so I'm trying to oh why did I start
[03:45:29] lagging I'm trying to level my uh Hera I
[03:45:31] think I pre- farmed enough of her while
[03:45:33] uh
[03:45:34] streaming but yeah I lowkey geared her a
[03:45:38] little just a little wait I [ __ ] up oh
[03:45:40] yeah I don't have a body dude I need a
[03:45:41] crit damage body on the follow attack
[03:45:43] set I don't have one I L don't have one

[05:22:56] optimizing the [ __ ] simulated
[05:22:59] Universe farming which is huge and it
[05:23:01] kind of implied that they're listening
[05:23:03] to feedback which is also
[05:23:05] huge because like I would kill for their
[05:23:09] other game to have a segment where they

[05:46:49] video wait which
[05:47:03] one this like a [ __ ] tutorial oh what
[05:47:06] the the
[05:47:09] [Music]
[05:47:16] [ __ ] it's called a Tut it is called a
[05:47:18] tutorial video am I
[05:47:24] stupid um well we also did get
[05:47:30] Shang anyways uh that was fun cool
[05:47:34] [Music]
[05:47:35] stream
[05:47:37] I was expecting crazier rewards to be
[05:47:39] honest but we still got a lot so it's
[05:47:41] not
[05:47:43] like I was just expecting like I was
[05:47:46] expecting like a like a like a [ __ ]
[05:47:55] storm but it's it's 30 pulls not 20 wait
[05:47:59] is it only oh cuz you get 10 per okay
[05:48:01] but you can't okay I agree that it's
[05:48:03] only 20 extra because you always get 10
[05:48:05] but it's also like it's a bit weird to
[05:48:09] like assume you're like obviously they
[05:48:11] always give 10 but like you know it's
[05:48:13] still 10 but yeah it's 30 plus whatever
[05:48:16] else this [ __ ] is plus a free fourar I
[05:48:18] think right am I missing something and
[05:48:30] advents 3 versus 30 yeah it' be 13
[05:48:33] versus it would be 13 versus 30 or 3
[05:48:34] versus 20
[05:48:37] but I mean obviously 30 is a lot better
[05:48:45] right 20 versus
[05:48:50] 30 cuz I was see new year
[05:48:59] yeah yeah there's also whatever the
[05:49:01] event gives you the [ __ ] that
[05:49:03] thing and this like this is cool
[05:49:07] right this is cool cuz it's uh four
[05:49:10] stars that are like wanted
[05:49:12] right that's not to say they're all like
[05:49:14] meta but it's um they're like new
[05:49:35] so
[05:49:37] tenan tweeted about it no
[05:49:40] no no what did you
[05:49:51] do
[05:49:53] no
[05:49:57] no k I love you but okay realistically
[05:50:00] it's if you're going to it's more it's
[05:50:03] definitely more than genin genin can
[05:50:04] never but it's not three cuz it not if
[05:50:06] anything it would be 3 versus 20 or 13
[05:50:08] versus 30 but also that wasn't the
[05:50:10] anniversary the anniversary was other
[05:50:11] thing which still was bad we should have
[05:50:13] gotten more but it was more than three
[05:50:14] but it's okay all good and and star is
[05:50:16] also getting technically more than 30
[05:50:18] cuz you're getting a free four star and
[05:50:19] you're getting other stuff so it's not
[05:50:20] actually but it's
[05:50:26] okay
[05:50:29] anyways
