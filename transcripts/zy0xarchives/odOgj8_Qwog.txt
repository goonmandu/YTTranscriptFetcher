[00:10:19] balls HD is Kaya skin uh we're gonna do
[00:10:21] an abyss clear and we're gonna do some
[00:10:23] artifact farming that is the plan uh I
[00:10:26] was prepping for videos before Fontan
[00:10:28] what I should do and I don't know I kind
[00:10:31] of want to make a blade video or guide
[00:10:33] but I don't know if I should so I'm
[00:10:34] debating that then I for sure want to
[00:10:36] make a video on the new Abyss
[00:10:39] um
[00:10:39] so we'll probably clear it maybe
[00:10:41] randomize it I don't know yet hello
[00:10:42] check you we're gonna do a new Abyss
[00:10:44] video I don't know what but we will do
[00:10:46] one and that's out in a few days
[00:10:49] um
[00:10:50] and I want to open I want to do probably
[00:10:53] I think I'm Gonna Save all of my strong
[00:10:55] box for whatever the new strongbox is I
[00:10:57] you know
[00:10:59] but I think I wanna do
[00:11:03] um a stream where I
[00:11:05] uid review so we're probably gonna open
[00:11:08] you IDE reviews but for a specific
[00:11:09] character I want it to be themed I don't
[00:11:11] know who yet though maybe I should wait
[00:11:13] for a Fontana character but I don't know
[00:11:15] I'm thinking of doing like a themed uid
[00:11:16] video we'll see it and I'm gonna open
[00:11:19] will account review Forums on my Discord
[00:11:22] for like basically the biggest whale
[00:11:24] accounts we'll just review them and like
[00:11:26] I think it'll be a funny video and
[00:11:29] I want to review Razer ninjas account
[00:11:31] again at some point but we're gonna give
[00:11:33] it some time so it's not like repeated
[00:11:34] content so that's the plan that's all
[00:11:36] gonna happen uh probably
[00:11:39] some stream this week will have some
[00:11:41] form of account review so if you're not
[00:11:43] in the Discord and you want to draw that
[00:11:44] estimatory Discord you could just get
[00:11:45] ready for that
[00:11:47] um
[00:11:48] yeah
[00:11:50] why not normal people reviews our last
[00:11:51] video is a normal people review our last
[00:11:53] video was uh free to play review so I
[00:11:55] like to alternate and also it depends
[00:11:57] what people like like I feel like people
[00:11:59] um the free play reviews are more like
[00:12:01] hey do this and then the whale reviews
[00:12:02] are more like
[00:12:04] either how do we fix this account or
[00:12:06] look at what this account is type of
[00:12:07] thing so it's a bit of a different vibe
[00:12:09] but our last video is a free to play one
[00:12:11] literally two videos ago free to play
[00:12:13] account review
[00:12:14] so it's not like I'm not you know doing

[00:13:34] to stream did I listened to a heart song
[00:13:37] that I heard before like damn this is
[00:13:38] good so then I worked out instead of
[00:13:40] streaming for like an hour and it kind
[00:13:42] of drained all my energy like I'm still
[00:13:44] kind of hyped but I'm dead as [ __ ]

[00:48:56] it would appear not why is there a hydro
[00:48:58] mimic no
[00:49:01] intro bit me
[00:49:03] the hydro mimics again
[00:49:06] imagine if they had Hydra mimics to 12 3
[00:49:13] be sure to add level 100 Hydra mimics
[00:49:22] for fonten because fontan's Hydro they
[00:49:25] should add level 100 hydrolytics on on
[00:49:28] the second half so you can't reset and
[00:49:30] also they add a new hydrominic okay they
[00:49:33] call them the hydro mimic man and what
[00:49:36] he does is he disables Shields so if you
[00:49:39] have a shield he'll do that much damage
[00:49:41] to you through your Shield so you
[00:49:43] actually can run Shields and then you
[00:49:44] have to deal with Hydro ducks
[00:49:47] good ideas wow
[00:49:52] sad Boombox is a 14 KJS it's a Nine Star

[00:51:19] then he will be the holy uh uh uh uh
[00:51:22] what's the ingredient in bread flour and
[00:51:25] then he makes bread for you that gives
[00:51:26] you 160 resin every day
[00:51:29] for free
[00:51:30] but you have to raid for it and you have
[00:51:32] to defeat the baguette dragon
[00:51:34] no yes the baguette Dragon who hates
[00:51:38] pastries and he roams around fonten
[00:51:40] burning everyone's croissants and all of
[00:51:43] their bread so you have to save fonten

[01:04:39] happening in China I think and you
[01:04:41] couldn't change your name so I was stuck
[01:04:43] as kokomi fan and I just kept it
[01:04:45] and then I was like started as like a

[01:07:42] that the eye patch was hereditary when I
[01:07:44] first started playing kitchen like it
[01:07:46] took me to like probably like a few
[01:07:47] months ago to realize that was a joke I
[01:07:50] just was like oh maybe it's a thing in
[01:07:52] this game because Fishel also had one
[01:07:54] like why would official have one
[01:07:55] I believe that it was hereditary and

[01:11:13] development of every character during
[01:11:15] the ants Arc and you think it's bad
[01:11:16] because you have a baby brain grow the
[01:11:18] [ __ ] up watch it and then the payoff is
[01:11:20] amazing and meru M is sick and netaro is
[01:11:22] the best character to ever be Hunter
[01:11:23] Hunter and then you watch you're like
[01:11:25] wow that was amazing and then you not
[01:11:27] you're welcome
[01:11:29] [Music]
[01:11:31] and that's probably still the worst Arc
[01:11:33] well no it's not but it's it's like even
[01:11:36] despite that is still amazing
[01:11:42] sorry to disappoint you miss Mage but I
[01:11:46] have lots of great stories about what
[01:11:47] Tatsumi Island though
[01:11:53] okay I don't think it's the worst Arc I
[01:11:55] just think it's like it's like uh it's
[01:11:56] like a run killer for some people
[01:11:59] because it's like it's like a long to
[01:12:01] get through but like I enjoyed it
[01:12:08] thank you
[01:12:11] but I also didn't I didn't dislike a
[01:12:13] single Arc and I I loved Green Island I
[01:12:15] think Green Island is amazing I [ __ ]
[01:12:16] love get at it and then they randomly
[01:12:18] played volleyball for some reason I died
[01:12:21] that didn't make sense but it's funny
[01:12:25] a non-donated one dollar Hunter x Hunter
[01:12:28] is fine but hisaken is a raging pedo and
[01:12:31] it makes me uncomfortable
[01:12:33] I mean Fair
[01:12:36] thank you
[01:12:37] but the Torah is a terrorist and so is
[01:12:39] child and you play against an impact as
[01:12:41] it turns out I see the streamer was 20
[01:12:44] in 2020 this lonely one turns 21 in five
[01:12:47] days also okay look listen I agree with
[01:12:51] you I fully agree with you but I also
[01:12:54] like maybe this is a bad take of mine
[01:12:56] because I don't watch that many anime so
[01:12:57] I actually don't know if this is a bad
[01:12:58] take but like
[01:13:00] I don't
[01:13:02] I can think our show is good even if a
[01:13:04] character is a blatant criminal like I
[01:13:06] could be like yeah I disavow his actions
[01:13:08] they're like he's a bad person but I
[01:13:10] still like the show like I don't I don't
[01:13:13] yeah but like if you're like I don't
[01:13:15] like like you're allowed to hate the
[01:13:16] [ __ ] character but
[01:13:18] if if that character makes you not enjoy
[01:13:20] the show that's fair but like
[01:13:22] I don't know there's a lot of like dude
[01:13:24] I like Game of Thrones other than the
[01:13:26] last season's that I think they fell off
[01:13:28] but I really enjoyed Game of Thrones I'm
[01:13:29] like the like one of the biggest houses
[01:13:32] is just like [ __ ] like it's like
[01:13:34] like the queen is like a psychopath
[01:13:37] incest it's just like this is like weird
[01:13:39] but like the show is still good feeling
[01:13:42] nervous
[01:13:46] well see oh okay there you go anyway
[01:13:50] maybe
[01:13:59] he was a huge I could tell that was
[01:14:01] after him unfortunately yeah I like to
[01:14:03] pretend season eight didn't happen and
[01:14:05] uh and Game of Thrones even seven like
[01:14:09] seven was bad but I endured it because I
[01:14:11] expected eight to be good so I didn't
[01:14:13] notice it was bad until after like when
[01:14:15] I was watching it I was like it's fine
[01:14:17] but then after eight I'm like yeah
[01:14:18] actually it was pretty bad
[01:14:21] [Music]
[01:14:24] yes hey right but the rest all landed in
[01:14:29] different areas
[01:14:30] rage you'll have to go now
[01:14:34] I still think it's worth watching though
[01:14:35] shall announce your respective Advent um
[01:14:38] you can just be yourself if you want no
[01:14:42] need to force the whole role-playing oh
[01:14:44] I see fine you're on ayaka if I'm a
[01:14:48] crowd battery yeah you still need
[01:14:49] something anyway like 130 140 but you
[01:14:51] can also just go Amino an amino other
[01:14:52] five minutes should be enough maybe like
[01:14:54] a little bit of ER
[01:14:58] earmark sometime in your business
[01:15:00] schedules to search the West Zone
[01:15:02] earmark
[01:15:04] Ed that mean it just means we mustn't
[01:15:06] dude I love a friend there's a Game of
[01:15:08] Thrones I love the Hound like the show
[01:15:10] well I don't really remember all of it
[01:15:12] because it's been a while but like I
[01:15:13] remember like anyone finds anything some
[01:15:15] of the characters are like worth it even
[01:15:16] if it fell off at the end
[01:15:21] [Music]
[01:15:22] the only good part okay this is like the
[01:15:24] only slight spoilers the only good part
[01:15:26] of season eight was that like the fight
[01:15:28] between the hound and the other dude
[01:15:31] that was like the only thing I enjoyed I
[01:15:33] was like thank God
[01:15:39] when you first saw it
[01:15:41] I'd have been more than happy to if this
[01:15:44] one component was enough to fix the
[01:15:46] whole domain when you're a child in Game
[01:15:48] of Thrones aired yes but I I didn't
[01:15:51] watch Game of Thrones until they
[01:15:53] announced season eight then I caught up
[01:15:55] this is I swear to God this is me I
[01:15:57] caught up season one to seven in like a
[01:16:00] week
[01:16:02] literally in like a week one to seven
[01:16:04] and then I watched Aid live with my
[01:16:06] homies and then we were all disappointed
[01:16:08] it was like yeah I like grinding
[01:16:13] yeah I was sad
[01:16:25] well the saddest part was that we were
[01:16:26] coping too like we watched episode one
[01:16:28] of the season they were like ah it's
[01:16:29] fine I'll get that like we're just
[01:16:30] building up the hype watches two yeah
[01:16:31] yeah next one's gonna be good and then
[01:16:33] whichever one was like all in the dark I
[01:16:35] was like okay I I'm I'm Minecrafting
[01:16:37] myself all good
[01:16:44] even during that episode during that
[01:16:46] long ass dark one the first like half an
[01:16:49] hour I was like it's fine like it's just
[01:16:51] they're building it up and then yeah I'm
[01:16:53] not gonna I'm not gonna spoil anywhere
[01:16:54] I'll just get it yeah
[01:17:05] oh
[01:17:06] hey so I haven't been meaning to ask
[01:17:09] what brand you hear kokomi I brought
[01:17:11] kokomi here actually coconut is like oh
[01:17:13] my God is ziox in the island I'm on my
[01:17:15] way

[01:17:23] heart victory
[01:17:27] was that it okay
[01:17:37] bro how do I open
[01:17:47] anyways I don't want to think about that
[01:17:49] anymore
[01:17:50] I don't want to think about that can we
[01:17:52] can we talk about Peak Peak fiction now
[01:17:56] talking about Hunter Hunter instead do I
[01:17:58] need to watch okay this is another thing
[01:18:00] I know I know okay you ever know that
[01:18:03] like you're gonna like if you watch a
[01:18:05] show you're gonna like it but you don't
[01:18:07] feel like it like that's me with one
[01:18:09] piece like I know it's gonna be amazing
[01:18:11] because everyone I know that has based
[01:18:13] opinions and that likes things that I
[01:18:16] like they like one piece everyone all of
[01:18:18] my friends
[01:18:20] but it's like I just dude I there is no
[01:18:23] way I'm watching dude I just can't like
[01:18:26] do you know how much time like I don't
[01:18:28] know
[01:18:34] I was like oh yeah the art style gets
[01:18:36] better after episode 8 800 it's like
[01:18:39] dude like yeah and I watched one of the
[01:18:42] movies the Z movie it was good like I
[01:18:44] actually enjoyed the movie
[01:18:46] but it's like yeah
[01:18:51] like I know I'm gonna watch it and I
[01:18:53] know I'm gonna like it
[01:18:56] and I know it's gonna be worth it and I
[01:18:58] also know that when you watch something
[01:19:00] that's good you want there to be more
[01:19:01] episodes like when Hunter Hunter like
[01:19:03] ended or Hiatus or whatever I'm like
[01:19:04] [ __ ] I need more it's like I get it
[01:19:07] but it's like

[01:25:09] time okay I started talking about two
[01:25:12] and like Fang was the one Fang was here
[01:25:14] and every time she saw him she would
[01:25:16] scream so like I don't know
[01:25:31] just before the canyon appeared I heard
[01:25:34] a faint sound
[01:25:36] would it have been the central hub

[01:33:06] helpers here after my brother as well
[01:33:08] [Music]
[01:33:10] those two you'll need them soon
[01:33:16] [Music]
[01:33:21] busy
[01:33:27] so this is the thrill of Adventure
[01:33:32] wait I don't want to go back right
[01:33:41] [Music]
[01:33:46] it's a banger
[01:33:54] okay
[01:33:56] [Music]
[01:34:09] can I kill these guys no
[01:34:17] [Music]
[01:34:26] I've seen you've just got finished no
[01:34:28] it's over connecting tracks
[01:34:30] let's go check the track switcher now
[01:34:32] it's over there but is it actually over
[01:34:34] sure I can go back surely it's not Joker
[01:34:38] what is this
[01:34:45] it's joover
[01:35:01] reminder guys
[01:35:03] [Music]
[01:35:06] reminder that if you use if you play
[01:35:08] kokomi in Fontan you get uh 50 more
[01:35:11] Primo gems from every chest so be sure
[01:35:13] to pull for her uh be sure to pull for
[01:35:16] her during her rerun
[01:35:23] oh my God I missed them
[01:35:30] how bro how
[01:35:34] [Music]
[01:35:39] do I have a good Hydra up a burger other
[01:35:41] than a Waterboy should I pull for next
[01:35:43] Banner uh yes but Fontan might like if
[01:35:46] you're attempted by the Fontana
[01:35:47] characters I want to be a good
[01:35:49] responsible person to tell you to save
[01:35:50] up but the value of Hydro 5 stars is
[01:35:54] higher the less you have so if you have
[01:35:56] none it's high value to get one but if
[01:35:59] you have one already then you don't need
[01:36:01] another
[01:36:10] foreign
[01:36:15] and we're never gonna talk about that
[01:36:17] yeah I didn't fail
[01:36:19] still pulling for meta um I mean that
[01:36:22] was meta advice but it's also kokomi and
[01:36:24] I would post for kokomi just because
[01:36:25] this could call me so that's up to you
[01:36:28] I also want to be responsible and be
[01:36:30] like hey
[01:36:31] Fontana soon so if you want to save for
[01:36:33] fonten that could be smart too
[01:36:42] what okay why is there no music here
[01:36:52] huh
[01:37:02] okay
[01:37:05] okay
[01:37:09] I'm focusing where's the last one
[01:37:11] oh here cool
[01:37:14] huh
[01:37:21] so we're going into demons
[01:37:32] you're a fake fan because you don't have
[01:37:34] the donut nope that's not true kokomi is
[01:37:37] not a materialist uh uh a person she
[01:37:41] appreciates that you enjoy her even with
[01:37:44] thrilling Tales or a free-to-play weapon
[01:37:47] kokomi would never make you pull for a
[01:37:50] useless and unnecessary weapon because
[01:37:52] she is not the type of person and kokomi
[01:37:54] Nation knows that
[01:38:04] hate me putau is like what you can't
[01:38:06] afford a Homa and then she makes fun of
[01:38:07] you but kokomi she understands that
[01:38:09] thrilling Tales is good and you
[01:38:12] shouldn't need a donut for her
[01:38:13] finally someone who can recognize that
[01:38:15] rather than just shrugging off my
[01:38:32] why is the alarm worth pulling for I
[01:38:34] have a video on that if you're actually
[01:38:35] wondering
[01:38:39] [Music]
[01:38:43] but think of it this way wait Miss what
[01:38:45] did I miss
[01:38:46] what did I miss
[01:38:49] Ed Singh show is like a top five unit or
[01:38:51] top 10 at least and yolan's just another
[01:38:54] one so there you go
[01:38:56] I'm sure we would have been buried in
[01:38:58] the sand but also buba respectfully
[01:39:01] [Music]
[01:39:05] top three yeah probably once we get
[01:39:08] switcher working again it's like Bennett
[01:39:11] in no order and then a dendro character
[01:39:13] uh Electro character
[01:39:19] Junction and then make a new card after
[01:39:21] that oh yeah
[01:39:24] wait a minute how did you get here it
[01:39:27] took a lot of effort for me to climb all
[01:39:28] the way up here did I mention okay well
[01:39:31] shangling is somewhere in the same tier
[01:39:33] but I are under but I don't think I
[01:39:35] don't think the best DPS character is as
[01:39:37] good as the third best support if that
[01:39:39] makes sense like
[01:39:41] unless it's like game breaking broken
[01:39:43] DPS I don't think the most broken you
[01:39:45] guess character is even as good as like
[01:39:47] any of the core supports so like
[01:39:50] yeah
[01:39:52] thanks for the insanity
[01:39:54] but like you know all there's a lot of
[01:39:56] characters that are like around there
[01:39:57] like shangling sucrose facial stuff like
[01:39:59] that
[01:40:03] sorry this is seven months red takes the
[01:40:05] tier one still recording three months or
[01:40:07] two months
[01:40:12] yeah
[01:40:13] things done on your own you always get
[01:40:15] someone else's you're one to talk what
[01:40:17] have you
[01:40:20] me his all right Jeremy well I thought
[01:40:24] those were the same person wait they're
[01:40:25] different oh I'd rather be focusing my
[01:40:27] efforts on fixing the track switch
[01:40:28] rather than arguing anyway
[01:40:30] you should calm down too Ferdinand
[01:40:33] all focus on the fine
[01:40:40] I'm sorry you had to see that my name's
[01:40:43] Jeremy hey journey I assume you're the

[01:41:43] are you asking scarra or kokomi uh could
[01:41:46] call me probably all right now

[01:41:55] credit is due hmm
[01:41:57] what you think you deserve the credit if

[02:12:55] correctly my guide but I also like
[02:12:58] saying names differently
[02:13:02] ah it just occurred to me that you
[02:13:04] probably ran into the Three Brothers
[02:13:06] while you were in the canyon also if
[02:13:08] this Region's actually based on France
[02:13:10] then folklore is getting guillotined if
[02:13:14] I remember correctly the two eldest
[02:13:16] brothers were taking their sickness
[02:13:20] I'm arguing with one another when they
[02:13:23] first don't get too attached
[02:13:28] you almost sound as if you're
[02:13:29] reminiscing about old friendsydia yes
[02:13:32] I've known them for quite some time
[02:13:34] after all
[02:13:35] but I seldom go to that area

[02:13:57] now that I've told you everything I I do
[02:14:01] like her top hat I think the top Hat's
[02:14:02] cool I mean I think characters with top
[02:14:05] hats are pretty cool but also the
[02:14:06] magicians have top hats right that they
[02:14:08] like throw or whatever I don't know but
[02:14:11] oh it's all right you've already

[02:14:18] archon bro you haven't even met her yet
[02:14:23] how was your favorite archon you
[02:14:25] literally don't know anything about her

[02:15:17] to character
[02:15:20] [Music]
[02:15:29] okay
[02:15:31] foreign
[02:15:41] I'm pretty sure I saw the Tweet about it

[02:16:36] with genjin it's how they give
[02:16:38] characters eight names and then you
[02:16:39] learn one and get attached to one and
[02:16:41] then they change it and then they change
[02:16:42] it again and then they change it again
[02:16:44] it's like dude [ __ ] off I get that it

[02:29:07] chatting if you are given a chance to
[02:29:09] rear roll a character
[02:29:11] and why would it be clay
[02:29:14] anyway
[02:29:17] why are some people saying it's short 10
[02:29:20] minutes and others are saying two hours
[02:29:24] about an hour
[02:29:41] if you Skip it's 30 minutes otherwise
[02:29:43] it's seven days
[02:29:47] okay let me at least uncut my resin
[02:29:48] let's at least uncap my resin like some
[02:29:50] are responsible
[02:30:01] yeah some are responsible
[02:30:07] [Music]
[02:30:18] nurses he escaped again I mean I would
[02:30:21] Escape if I was with a nurse because why
[02:30:23] would I need to be there because I'm
[02:30:25] sane so I yes
[02:30:27] a sane person doesn't need to be in an
[02:30:29] asylum
[02:30:30] so why the [ __ ] would I be there
[02:30:40] wait what am I doing
[02:30:49] you know I've never heard the Vermillion
[02:30:51] music before I've done this domain
[02:30:53] probably a thousand times and I've never
[02:30:54] heard the [ __ ] soundtrack
[02:31:00] oh I didn't even condensed five resin
[02:31:02] what the [ __ ] am I doing
[02:31:03] how did that happen
[02:31:05] whatever
[02:31:16] oh Chad we got updated resin calcs
[02:31:19] apparently
[02:31:21] from uh the person that did the first
[02:31:24] calyx of how much resin I've spent on
[02:31:26] Vermillion they made a second one
[02:31:29] so Cloud who's not one of my twitch mods
[02:31:32] I mean Discord mods
[02:31:39] made an Excel sheet
[02:31:42] days from Chasm release 469 resin gate
[02:31:46] each day 160 natural total resin 750 75
[02:31:51] 000 assumed stream frequency in days
[02:31:53] three assumed amount of streams over
[02:31:56] number of days 157 amount of refresh per
[02:31:59] stream five tote was four but you only
[02:32:02] put 160 here so fair enough
[02:32:04] total resin refreshes 785 resin per
[02:32:07] refresh 60. resin from refresh every
[02:32:09] stream 300 total resin from streams 47
[02:32:12] 000 total rough estimated resin spent in
[02:32:15] Vermillion
[02:32:16] 122 140 because it used to be like 70
[02:32:19] cares how much was it before
[02:32:22] 80k
[02:32:24] oh
[02:32:25] wait what
[02:32:29] oh
[02:32:31] wait the updated estimated resident is
[02:32:34] 120k
[02:32:40] [Music]
[02:32:47] well
[02:32:59] total time spent in Vermillion hours
[02:33:01] 84.8
[02:33:08] but he just DM me I extended on it
[02:33:12] what the [ __ ] is this
[02:33:17] chance
[02:33:20] finished building one over three number
[02:33:24] of runs three thousand eight hundred
[02:33:25] number of shao laments Assuming he's
[02:33:28] using Xiao 1200
[02:33:31] .
[02:33:38] total number of possible leyline runs
[02:33:41] okay guys so let's say hypothetically I
[02:33:45] never went to Vermillion and I did more
[02:33:47] on Ley lines instead here's how much
[02:33:48] more I would have
[02:33:50] wait what
[02:33:52] how many is that wait million is here
[02:33:56] then that's 10 million that's 100
[02:34:00] 366 million Maura
[02:34:07] what
[02:34:09] oh also these numbers incorrect uh per
[02:34:11] 20 residents 61 000 more uh not 60. by
[02:34:15] the way but also what the [ __ ] foreign
[02:34:27] if I had that
[02:34:30] could you imagine I've had the 400
[02:34:32] million more already
[02:34:36] for font 10.
[02:34:40] hey what is this total money spent on
[02:34:42] resin refreshes in Vermillion four okay
[02:34:44] that's not true though that's not true
[02:34:46] though because I get Primos from
[02:34:47] exploring and like content creator
[02:34:50] actually you don't get that much and I'm
[02:34:51] not allowed to talk about it literally
[02:34:52] actually I get like nothing but standing
[02:34:54] around I didn't spend that much it's
[02:34:56] like donations I use your subs to farm
[02:34:59] content for you guys
[02:35:05] copium no like okay let's say you guys
[02:35:08] sub to the stream right and then I'm
[02:35:10] like oh like okay so twitch takes half
[02:35:12] and then what's left of the other half I
[02:35:14] make content better for you guys it's
[02:35:16] like Mr Beast reinvests into his videos
[02:35:19] I reinvested to Vermillion
[02:35:21] [Music]
[02:35:31] [Music]
[02:35:33] foreign
[02:35:35] total number of runs of Vermillion
[02:35:37] 6107 yeah but condense is probably half
[02:35:40] of that with condensed 2300
[02:35:45] oh
[02:35:48] total amount of artifacts obtained 6534.
[02:35:56] and it's also probably more than well it
[02:35:59] could be more than this because this
[02:36:00] fact this assumes us once every three
[02:36:03] days but I guess some streams I don't do
[02:36:04] Vermillion and then sometimes they do it
[02:36:06] off stream so fair enough
[02:36:10] damn but still at least 100K like even
[02:36:13] if it's 20K off that's at least 100k
[02:36:18] no
[02:36:20] total amounts of good artifacts zero
[02:36:27] though
[02:36:31] what are we looking at how much I spent
[02:36:33] on Vermilion so the total amount of
[02:36:35] resin is 122 000 estimated and if you're
[02:36:40] wondering how much moral that would be
[02:36:41] it would be
[02:36:43] 366 million
[02:36:46] a bit more
[02:36:53] Vlog bye thanks for 10 gifted
[02:37:00] well it's all good
[02:37:06] more gifted Subs to spend on Vermillion
[02:37:09] can't wait can't wait
[02:37:20] well surely by the way Shirley will get
[02:37:23] a good Vermillion set before Fontana by
[02:37:26] the way surely our our our Vermilion
[02:37:28] will be done
[02:37:29] but I feel like you should probably prep
[02:37:31] for other [ __ ]
[02:37:34] huh
[02:37:39] [Music]
[02:37:42] chat my shower is a weird glitch where
[02:37:44] when I press my skill I lose my some
[02:37:46] energy I don't know why it's actually
[02:37:48] kind of weird
[02:37:50] does anyone know donated three dollars
[02:37:53] let's be real here are not a content
[02:37:55] creator you make weird noises you talk
[02:37:58] like a Marvel character saying one line
[02:38:00] quips thinking they're funny
[02:38:02] okay that's not true I don't know why
[02:38:05] you said that
[02:38:09] foreign what's your wander's name
[02:38:21] [Music]
[02:38:23] okay uh do we get do I do the quest off
[02:38:27] stream or do we get the skin right now
[02:38:29] because I want to do Abyss
[02:38:31] but I kind of want Kaya's skin for this
[02:38:33] but I don't know how long it'll take
[02:38:36] wait you can check
[02:38:39] your archived to see how many times
[02:38:40] you've killed ruin graders
[02:38:47] the [ __ ] is that actually a thing
[02:38:53] [Music]
[02:38:56] okay but I'll probably be a lot less
[02:38:58] then so it'll like reassure us
[02:38:59] [Music]
[02:39:12] do you really want to know that's
[02:39:14] actually a good point I kind of don't
[02:39:15] want to
[02:39:19] foreign
[02:39:24] pyro slimes though so there's no I've
[02:39:26] killed more like ruined enemies
[02:39:34] what's in the emblem domain the the lava
[02:39:36] troll right okay let's check emblem
[02:39:38] let's check emblem
[02:39:48] oh 2000 uh electrocus majors
[02:39:53] okay
[02:39:54] what's another domain I did verodes
[02:39:56] inventor a lot
[02:39:58] I use the camera
[02:40:04] that's not accurate wait why not does it
[02:40:06] not testimony donated one dollar that
[02:40:09] other person was not based chat likes to
[02:40:12] make fun but you truly are an
[02:40:13] entertaining and hard-working Creator oh
[02:40:16] thank you for my comfort stream alone
[02:40:18] not a paid actor by the way not paid
[02:40:20] actor
[02:40:22] wait okay where's the
[02:40:28] wait where's the emblem what the [ __ ] is
[02:40:30] Inverness it's like treasure hoarders
[02:40:32] right
[02:40:34] probably 1400 Oh this one's four
[02:40:36] thousand six hundred
[02:40:38] I I assume that one's Inverness
[02:40:40] four six hundred
[02:40:56] yeah there's also the Pyro agent
[02:40:59] 27.
[02:41:02] okay should I click on the Rune grader
[02:41:04] should I actually just do it
[02:41:13] does it actually count them what's the
[02:41:15] other one there's like a triangle thing
[02:41:17] and a [ __ ] thing
[02:41:22] what do you think it'll be like 2000
[02:41:27] it's not that many I haven't done that
[02:41:29] much of a million
[02:41:34] well like two thousand
[02:41:41] 2500
[02:41:44] that's reasonable
[02:41:56] oh double it for condensed runs true
[02:42:01] yeah let's at least get it to 2500.
[02:42:11] not accurate I don't know is it is this
[02:42:13] accurate or not I actually don't know
[02:42:15] but also yeah there's also condenses
[02:42:17] double
[02:42:36] feels good man wait
[02:42:39] Chad
[02:42:41] wait that actually means I'm close to
[02:42:43] 100K
[02:42:47] we literally need like
[02:42:48] like 20 more runs 30. and it's 100k
[02:42:53] we basically spent 100 count per million
[02:42:55] assuming this is accurate like I know
[02:42:57] there's like a few in like there's not
[02:42:59] in the overall basically but there's
[02:43:00] like a few in the abyss but you know
[02:43:03] give or take
[02:43:07] oh [ __ ] wait
[02:43:17] I guess that's accurate because in the
[02:43:18] estimate it assumes five refreshes but
[02:43:20] only do four on stream so I guess that's
[02:43:22] the main Gap but I've also spent fragile
[02:43:24] resin
[02:43:27] yeah wait we can actually confirm 100K
[02:43:29] resin then
[02:43:30] because I I assumed it's always been
[02:43:31] around 100K like I've been saying 100K
[02:43:33] but it's actually close that means I
[02:43:36] could get 100k
[02:43:38] why are you happy about this because
[02:43:39] it's exciting
[02:43:42] I spent 100K resin on Xiao here's how it
[02:43:46] looked
[02:43:52] I'm excited
[02:43:55] I'm excited
[02:43:57] at 100K resin you get there's a Pity
[02:44:00] artifact
[02:44:19] foreign
[02:44:22] how many hilly trolls have I killed wait
[02:44:26] I want to see if there's a chance that
[02:44:27] I've killed more Rune graders than like
[02:44:29] a type of hilly troll there's no way but
[02:44:30] it would be funny
[02:44:33] wait actually
[02:44:38] wait I've killed more Rune graders than
[02:44:40] these [ __ ] girls
[02:44:44] not this one though not this one but
[02:44:46] that's [ __ ] funny
[02:44:51] oh [ __ ]
[02:44:56] [Laughter]
[02:44:57] how is that possible
[02:45:04] and the thing with ruin graders is like
[02:45:06] if you're smart like let's say you're
[02:45:08] like a good account you've probably
[02:45:09] killed like 20. like you've killed them
[02:45:12] in like Dragon spine and like once in
[02:45:14] the abyss that's it that's like actually
[02:45:17] it
[02:45:19] [Music]
[02:45:22] okay let me turn the music off
[02:45:34] there's a couple in sumeru yeah true
[02:45:37] actually true
[02:45:39] true true
[02:45:45] do you have a friendship team now what's
[02:45:47] our friendship team
[02:45:55] wait what let me timestamp this in case
[02:45:56] I use it for a video two hours
[02:45:59] time stamping two hours 30 of this
[02:46:03] stream
[02:46:10] because I think I make a I spent 100K
[02:46:12] resin on Vermillion video before Fontan
[02:46:14] comes out I think we try to hit 100K now
[02:46:16] [ __ ] it and then we'll see what we get
[02:46:24] please show najita build do you know
[02:46:26] what sure
[02:46:28] um she's on sack prags for deepwood 522
[02:46:31] em
[02:46:33] with this but I don't know if this is
[02:46:34] the correct build because I feel like
[02:46:36] you should have a bit more em yeah yeah
[02:46:37] we're on the wrong piece this piece is
[02:46:39] really good but
[02:46:40] uh we're usually on
[02:46:43] the where the [ __ ] you have one
[02:46:46] this one because uh this one
[02:46:49] because we want a bit more em on her for
[02:46:50] all feel like Oh My Player on field and
[02:46:52] off field which is why I like balancing
[02:46:53] em and crit
[02:46:55] uh
[02:46:56] um
[02:46:58] but usually we have a bit more so here
[02:47:00] at 625
[02:47:05] oh well I crowned nahida when the [ __ ]
[02:47:07] did I crown nahida
[02:47:08] oh cool
[02:47:23] yeah I mean the crowding he does bass
[02:47:25] but I didn't know I did
[02:47:27] [Music]
[02:47:39] dude maybe if we oh what if we claim
[02:47:42] Vermillion as a cat we'll catch it off
[02:47:44] guard
[02:47:47] we'll cash the domain off guard
[02:47:54] them no we did not catch it off guard
[02:48:06] why is turned delayed off chat it's like
[02:48:09] as little as possible twitch has like a
[02:48:12] default like seven seconds or something
[02:48:13] but it's not a lot
[02:48:21] [Music]
[02:48:24] seems like an emergency
[02:48:30] build you Donuts but why do why is there
[02:48:33] a meta of people calling me a donut
[02:48:34] where does that even come from also what
[02:48:37] type of donut
[02:48:40] s
[02:48:47] okay
[02:48:58] dude kid someone what do you guys think
[02:49:01] the average amount of resin you need to
[02:49:03] spend for a Vermilion a Nemo goblet with
[02:49:05] crit rate and crit damage because that's
[02:49:07] basically what I've been looking for for
[02:49:08] a 100K resin and I want to know like how
[02:49:11] unlucky I am
[02:49:12] how much you have to spend on average
[02:49:22] I got it in 20 Giga chat okay [ __ ] you
[02:49:27] this
[02:49:29] shot one with Wind and Fire
[02:49:33] because like I know you're like guys
[02:49:35] that's impossible but like again I'm not
[02:49:38] flexing because this doesn't matter
[02:49:40] because I didn't get it but like like so
[02:49:43] what is the opposite of that it's Echoes
[02:49:46] Hydro for ayato with crit rate and crit
[02:49:48] damage I have two
[02:49:52] two
[02:49:56] each of these could have been a Nemo
[02:49:58] verdescence I mean Vermillion
[02:50:01] and then it's like I have like I have
[02:50:03] [ __ ] dude
[02:50:05] I have deepwood dendro I got this like
[02:50:08] day two
[02:50:10] of dendro being out I also have deepwood
[02:50:13] [ __ ] uh gilded
[02:50:16] I mean what uh dendro gilded
[02:50:19] where is it I have this one but I have a
[02:50:21] better one
[02:50:22] I have two
[02:50:24] I don't know man
[02:50:25] and I did not spend as much rest in
[02:50:27] there
[02:50:30] mine decided
[02:50:42] what if I claim baiju bursting help
[02:50:45] comes first
[02:51:00] hey baby was right flowers actually good
[02:51:03] we actually need a flower okay this
[02:51:04] could be good
[02:51:05] that could be good
[02:51:08] [Music]
[02:51:10] maybe maybe this is our Redemption Arc
[02:51:12] okay okay granted I should be prepping
[02:51:15] for Fontaine in like emblem or deepwood
[02:51:18] but hey I'm determined okay let's check
[02:51:20] that
[02:51:22] travel now or later
[02:51:25] we'll get it to plus four if the plus
[02:51:27] four is good I'll level it to 20 if it's
[02:51:28] bad we'll save it for later because that
[02:51:30] means we're getting bad vibes right now
[02:51:31] and I don't really [ __ ] with that
[02:51:41] we'll get it to plus four we'll get to
[02:51:43] plus four
[02:51:44] let's just Auto add
[02:51:47] first good piece in like a year yeah but
[02:51:50] it's only three stats so don't speak too
[02:51:51] soon if it gets ER that would be perfect
[02:51:55] flat attack is whatever like it's okay
[02:51:57] but ER would be what we want oh my God
[02:52:11] I think now that we realize how much
[02:52:13] resin we spent in Vermillion the game is
[02:52:15] like oh [ __ ] we forgot to give him a
[02:52:17] good piece and now they give me one I
[02:52:18] think that's what's happening
[02:52:21] I think that's what's happening
[02:52:26] mods Ben anyone that's typing page ER or
[02:52:29] page attack
[02:52:36] laughs
[02:52:43] I can't wait till this rolls only uh
[02:52:50] [ __ ] you paper p
[02:52:55] I'm like I'm like seeing you know like
[02:52:57] Doctor Strange where he sees every
[02:52:59] timeline and every possibility that's me
[02:53:01] right now I literally just imagined a
[02:53:03] world where this rolled every possible
[02:53:05] stat
[02:53:08] I'm like not ready for the outcomes
[02:53:12] I can already see what like the
[02:53:15] different possibilities oh in case you
[02:53:17] guys are wondering just before I do this
[02:53:19] can I just show you guys uh a similar
[02:53:21] flower please
[02:53:24] so you see this piece let me show you
[02:53:25] another piece
[02:53:29] this happened
[02:53:38] this also happened
[02:53:48] this is unironically good on like Beto
[02:53:50] or like I mean they're not gonna use
[02:53:53] Vermillion though I guess yay Miko could
[02:53:54] use two-piece kind of
[02:53:58] official and like a weird solo Electro
[02:54:00] team where you're not generating [ __ ]
[02:54:02] maybe
[02:54:04] copium
[02:54:09] go on a 50 attack is so good yeah but
[02:54:11] Vermillion makes attack worse like
[02:54:12] attack's still good but I run for a
[02:54:14] million plus middle farzan plus Bennett
[02:54:18] plus Nobles so it's like it's a bit
[02:54:19] worse to have attack than crit
[02:54:22] foreign
[02:54:37] I'm skipping the song we need some high
[02:54:39] bass Anthem ah
[02:54:44] [ __ ] it what if I play Dougherty theme
[02:54:50] [Music]
[02:54:53] what about this goofy ass theme
[02:54:56] [Music]
[02:55:02] because
[02:55:04] yeah she's a scammer so we're gonna scan
[02:55:07] this artifact and to giving us crit
[02:55:10] watch crit damage thanks Dory
[02:55:13] thanks Dory thank you
[02:55:17] [Music]
[02:55:28] Dory is a scammer her soundtrack scams
[02:55:32] the artifact and we get Chris
[02:55:34] [Music]
[02:55:36] these are low rolls
[02:55:39] these are very low rolls but a crit is
[02:55:42] crit
[02:55:42] and scamming is working
[02:55:45] not that jinx it
[02:55:49] [Music]
[02:55:55] let's go
[02:56:01] why are we getting the lowest rules
[02:56:03] known to man
[02:56:10] good though this is still good
[02:56:15] it's still good
[02:56:21] it only had three stats and now it's
[02:56:23] getting low rolls which is like the
[02:56:25] worst possibility but it's all crit and
[02:56:27] if the next one is correct
[02:56:32] seven point acre damage
[02:56:34] [Music]
[02:56:49] please please script we're gonna scan
[02:56:53] this last roll but this has to be a big
[02:56:55] role this has to be a big role big crit
[02:56:56] roll
[02:56:57] [Music]
[02:57:03] [Applause]
[02:57:06] [Music]
[02:57:16] it's it's a lot of good stats
[02:57:20] um it's not bad it is alive
[02:57:24] wait what's the good value on this
[02:57:28] like 30 something
[02:57:31] [Music]
[02:57:36] stats
[02:57:39] [Music]
[02:57:44] wait how about 5.8 times 2 is 10 or 11.6

[02:57:50] oh wow oh wow I mean
[02:57:56] giant 0x dead
[02:57:59] foreign
[02:58:01] [Music]
[02:58:10] it's a lot of good stats
[02:58:15] attack is underrated energy recharge but
[02:58:19] so the Erza Laurel then our crit rate is
[02:58:22] low double low roll then our crit damage
[02:58:24] is like triple Laurel
[02:58:27] because let's say it's seven
[02:58:29] point eight times three like let's say
[02:58:31] seven times two that's 21.
[02:58:41] traded
[02:58:43] 366 million more for this [ __ ] you dude
[02:58:48] [ __ ] you
[02:58:50] um
[02:58:51] [Music]
[02:59:05] current value is not everything
[02:59:07] [Music]
[02:59:21] bro you could level another piece to 12
[02:59:24] and it would be better
[02:59:37] yeah this is better
[02:59:40] [Music]
[02:59:43] maybe I need the 0.5 ER the 4.5 ER
[02:59:50] even this is arguably better
[02:59:53] [Music]
[03:00:00] yeah this is so much better
[03:00:02] [Music]
[03:00:04] how much the artist shall even need
[03:00:06] usually 120 to 140 but mine needs a lot
[03:00:08] less because I have like C6 cars on and
[03:00:11] then C1 Xiao

[03:03:51] wasn't like a conducted or anything so I
[03:03:53] got benty by accident by trying to get

[03:03:56] Barbers five shanglings and no officials
[03:03:59] I kept going
[03:04:00] and then I skipped clear and then I
[03:04:01] pulled for child and then after that I
[03:04:03] put her on

[03:08:44] what the [ __ ]
[03:08:50] yeah that's actually cool

[03:09:09] shorter range look found ironically
[03:09:12] baiju's attacks are shorter range than
[03:09:13] this
[03:09:15] and he's a catalyst
[03:09:22] all right
[03:09:23] um let's go connect more resin
[03:09:32] are these are transient too
[03:09:38] well no

[03:09:50] comes out what am I gonna do scan them
[03:09:52] I'm not gonna scam them
[03:09:54] I'm not gonna scan them

[03:10:07] child comes up to you and you don't give
[03:10:09] them food you're the [ __ ] okay so
[03:10:12] this is basically what happened to me
[03:10:14] someone gave me money for a task and I
[03:10:17] had to do it
[03:10:21] we're gonna listen to bison's theme
[03:10:26] 's getting wedged into my pop pads
[03:10:32] I haven't been to my dailies yet I've
[03:10:34] just been farming Vermilion like a
[03:10:35] degenerate for no reason
[03:10:40] thank you
[03:10:51] what did he suddenly care about kids
[03:10:53] I've always cared about the the the
[03:10:55] health of our nation for example the you
[03:10:59] know when I showed you guys how I burned
[03:11:00] my hand there's still like low-key a
[03:11:02] Mark I don't know if my camera can show
[03:11:03] it but there's like a line here
[03:11:05] where I burnt myself
[03:11:08] I was rescuing kittens from a burning
[03:11:10] building and then I noticed after I
[03:11:12] didn't take any damage but then I
[03:11:13] noticed after that there's a toddler
[03:11:15] crying in the midst of the fire was I
[03:11:17] just gonna leave him there most people
[03:11:19] would have because what you're gonna run
[03:11:21] into the fire and maybe die most people
[03:11:23] would have but I didn't I
[03:11:26] I saved a kid and
[03:11:29] and as they ran to the fire most people
[03:11:31] would have burned much more than I did I
[03:11:33] just have a small Mark and I saved that
[03:11:37] toddler's life
[03:11:38] [Music]
[03:11:41] and honestly I don't even expect
[03:11:43] anything in return but uh just at least

[04:29:42] forgot okay
[04:29:44] right it starts doesn't matter
[04:29:49] it's not worth the time to reset
[04:29:51] I also want a 90 alloy for the meme but
[04:29:54] I'll probably do that off stream
[04:29:56] I don't know if I will maybe I never
[04:29:58] will but it'd be funny
[04:30:08] like Kaya fan I know dude I don't know

[04:31:55] also the 60 Primo's there
[04:31:58] that's like one resin refresh that's

[04:33:42] don't know why I'll try to stream
[04:33:43] earlier next time uh
[04:33:45] I might do like a random early stream
[04:33:47] just to finish the Kaya skin because I
[04:33:48] want to record a video with the skin so
[04:33:50] I have to do that soon so expect to
[04:33:53] stream in like a day or two I'll say in
[04:33:55] two to be realistic but it might be in
[04:33:57] one so there might be a surprise early
[04:33:59] stream we'll see
[04:34:01] um
[04:34:04] yeah I don't know why I'm so tired I
[04:34:06] guess because I worked out and stuff
