[00:09:04] hear that from me
[00:09:06] I think because I know like that so I
[00:09:09] think we're gonna do a similar one
[00:09:11] I think that's the plan I think we're
[00:09:12] alternating so yeah welcome to the
[00:09:14] stream
[00:09:15] um
[00:09:22] destroying themselves dude they've been
[00:09:24] destroying themselves for like two years
[00:09:25] nothing has changed it's just at some
[00:09:27] point they're gonna do something so bad
[00:09:28] there's just there's like no competition
[00:09:30] right now like like YouTube's like
[00:09:32] listening to their creators like I've
[00:09:33] actually talked to some of the YouTube
[00:09:34] people they're actually smart with it
[00:09:35] but like for some reason their streaming
[00:09:36] thing is still undiscoverable so it's
[00:09:38] like not really a viable option
[00:09:40] kick is owned by like a gambling company
[00:09:42] and the face of kick is like a [ __ ]
[00:09:46] yeah I mean you guys know who it is so
[00:09:49] it is what it is and then it's like the
[00:09:51] other websites are like [ __ ] like
[00:09:53] Bumble like okay wow Kink or Bumble oh
[00:09:56] [ __ ] wow great off maybe at some point
[00:09:58] like maybe a [ __ ] if it's not
[00:10:00] marketed as like
[00:10:02] the Cesspool of Aiden Ross viewers maybe
[00:10:04] at some point but for now it's kind of
[00:10:06] just like
[00:10:08] I don't know
[00:10:17] maybe at some point
[00:10:20] but I mean I
[00:10:21] I just want to be wherever you guys are
[00:10:23] I don't give a [ __ ] as long as you guys
[00:10:24] are here I don't do streaming for money
[00:10:26] like obviously I want to live but like I
[00:10:28] if anything I think YouTube is more like
[00:10:31] profit so like I don't really I just
[00:10:32] stream for fun so I don't care if they
[00:10:34] take I mean I don't think they should
[00:10:36] take half of our sub Revenue but hey it

[00:14:48] right last endless last endless
[00:14:51] okay
[00:14:52] easy
[00:14:55] whoa xox you are so tall and cool can
[00:14:59] you please review the new banners oh
[00:15:02] yeah good thanks for asking I'm actually
[00:15:04] about to do that thanks chatter for the
[00:15:06] message that you left in my chat okay so
[00:15:08] there's new banners in gadget impact
[00:15:10] whoa isn't this a star real stream [ __ ]
[00:15:12] you catching it back okay so there's uh
[00:15:14] two characters two weapons zero [ __ ]
[00:15:18] so very uh sex banners pull for them
[00:15:21] maybe oh should I pull for them I'm
[00:15:24] gonna record uh should you pull for both
[00:15:26] but instead of doing two videos and and
[00:15:28] milking you guys like cows I'm gonna
[00:15:30] make one it's gonna be are they really
[00:15:32] broken I'll hike them boom two in one
[00:15:34] and then I'll make guides so that's the
[00:15:36] plan but tldr cause was [ __ ] broken
[00:15:38] I'll hide them broken if you need a DPS
[00:15:40] if you don't yeah you can skip them he's
[00:15:42] replaceable you play on field nahida you
[00:15:44] can do other [ __ ] but I think he's
[00:15:46] really good as the main DPS Ed has aged
[00:15:48] like fine butter and only got better
[00:15:51] since like you know new characters and
[00:15:53] new teams and it's just a good DPS so I
[00:15:55] think both are good but obviously cos is
[00:15:57] more valuable
[00:15:59] Stars shangling
[00:16:13] [Music]
[00:16:26] obviously really good if you don't have
[00:16:28] a C4 then this Banner is good but I
[00:16:30] think I also think people need to stop
[00:16:31] pretending I think people need to stop
[00:16:33] pretending
[00:16:34] that
[00:16:36] we don't have shangling like I feel like
[00:16:38] everyone has tangling at this point like
[00:16:39] I feel like if you don't have a bunch of
[00:16:41] shiny constellations you probably either
[00:16:43] are like
[00:16:44] have Insane luck or just started playing
[00:16:46] because like everyone has been playing
[00:16:48] for a while has like a million
[00:16:49] changlings or like at least like I don't
[00:16:51] know if you don't ever see four it's
[00:16:52] really good get it
[00:16:55] um
[00:16:56] but
[00:16:59] yeah
[00:17:00] Hazel he's okay he's kind of like
[00:17:02] sucrose if you don't know that sucrose
[00:17:05] could be played in taser then he's good
[00:17:07] uh these you know people like him so
[00:17:09] he's pretty decent and then like he's
[00:17:11] he's like mid but like not in a bad way
[00:17:12] like if you want to play and play them
[00:17:14] but you don't need them and then yeah
[00:17:15] yeah it's really good I think yeah it
[00:17:16] was really good I think yayao is one of
[00:17:18] the best four stars
[00:17:20] really good
[00:17:23] yeah Hazel's also my wallpaper so he's
[00:17:25] also my oh it's all coming out now don't
[00:17:28] ask
[00:17:29] yeah like I really I really like his old
[00:17:31] but like obviously you could just do
[00:17:32] sucrose and a lot of times sucrose is
[00:17:33] better but you know I mean you
[00:17:35] I mean strangling's good if you don't
[00:17:36] have C4 and then yeah is uh really good
[00:17:39] and then Cosmos come and I'll hide them
[00:17:42] as calm
[00:17:43] so they're both good weapon Banner
[00:17:46] uh there should be a gate being like
[00:17:49] stay away from weapon batter unless you
[00:17:51] must be this tall to ride this ride and
[00:17:53] then if you're not you can't get the
[00:17:54] weapon matter uh with that said I think
[00:17:57] this is a wit okay so the two radar
[00:17:59] weapons are a win for our hyper Mains
[00:18:00] because you can use either Freedom sword
[00:18:02] or light a fully decision on them like
[00:18:04] obviously fully decisions better but you
[00:18:06] can also use the EM sword on him because
[00:18:07] he scales on em so like if you need a
[00:18:09] weapon from it's fine however
[00:18:11] it's still a weapon manner you don't
[00:18:13] need it Jade cutter is still more
[00:18:14] Universal although like a lot more
[00:18:16] Universal uh because lighter folios are
[00:18:18] just like good stats but like it's not
[00:18:19] good on everyone or not the best on
[00:18:21] everyone but freedom is really good
[00:18:24] um so like Freedom was really good but
[00:18:26] then fully decisions good on like a few
[00:18:28] characters like I'll hide them kaching
[00:18:29] and uh one more that I can't think of
[00:18:32] it's also okay on Aika but you can't
[00:18:34] really make use of the em but anyways
[00:18:37] um yeah and then the four stars are like
[00:18:41] either amazing or
[00:18:43] Terror I mean they're amazing but like
[00:18:47] yeah I think they are so I've seen some
[00:18:49] people say like they're really good but
[00:18:51] what if you don't need five sword or
[00:18:53] like it's bad if you because you might
[00:18:54] already have but like dude I feel like
[00:18:56] you need like 10 fastwords I feel like I
[00:18:58] have like an r55 sword and I still use
[00:19:01] other fast swords on other swords like
[00:19:03] you need like 10 fast swords everyone
[00:19:04] uses fast sword dude faster is so good
[00:19:06] even Bennett can use it
[00:19:08] and I hate using it up at it
[00:19:10] but yeah fast was really good five uh uh
[00:19:13] book
[00:19:14] what did I call it book five catalyst is
[00:19:17] good or codex is good on like Mona on
[00:19:20] field nahida if you're either as a Jeff
[00:19:22] or have no [ __ ] energy anywhere in
[00:19:25] your team but probably just a few years
[00:19:26] of Jeff
[00:19:28] um so they're nice I think sword is like
[00:19:30] one of the best like sword is really
[00:19:31] good book is good on like a few
[00:19:33] characters but usually you don't care
[00:19:34] unless you play mono or nahida and
[00:19:37] you're the Jeff and then Aqua no wait
[00:19:39] wavebreaker Finn that's what it's called
[00:19:41] it's pretty
[00:19:46] pretty good
[00:19:47] uh it's not great sword you know you
[00:19:50] might be a Dory player if not it's kind
[00:19:52] of yeah I wouldn't really I don't like
[00:19:54] it it's kind of trash and then [ __ ]
[00:19:56] Moon's Moon Sun Sun balls balls is that
[00:19:59] even Moon Moon let me look up Moon
[00:20:01] Moon's moon is that it
[00:20:04] yeah it is
[00:20:07] yeah it's basically the same thing as
[00:20:08] this but [ __ ] for a bow so it's like
[00:20:10] you know
[00:20:12] I think I use it attack he's not
[00:20:14] officials of [ __ ] but
[00:20:17] not not official sorry
[00:20:18] um like I honestly I don't like it like
[00:20:21] I was gonna see Elan but just go Fab I I
[00:20:22] don't like moonsman I forgot about yeah
[00:20:25] I don't like mizun but aquamar was good
[00:20:27] fives are good and then Sak is kind of
[00:20:28] mid
[00:20:36] never mind get movement for Eloy because
[00:20:38] you can go blizzard sprayer burst damage
[00:20:41] attack percent is good for alloy
[00:20:45] true
[00:20:49] sworn good for shaft it's not good but
[00:20:51] it's not bad like obviously you'd rather
[00:20:53] have light for him and you'd rather use
[00:20:54] stream sworn on kazua or you can use it
[00:20:56] on like kooky or [ __ ] right like you can
[00:20:58] use one of the characters too but like
[00:20:59] if you need to hide the weapon and you
[00:21:01] miss the 50 50 and you get Freedom sworn
[00:21:02] it's a pretty good option like it's not
[00:21:04] bad it's okay
[00:21:06] it's just like you'd rather get the
[00:21:07] other one for him
[00:21:11] you know
[00:21:20] is it Moon good for Sarah I mean sure
[00:21:23] but Sarah wants basic attack in ER but
[00:21:26] if you're like hyper investing you're if
[00:21:27] you're one of the people that are like
[00:21:28] I'm playing [ __ ] aggravate Sarah and
[00:21:32] yeah
[00:21:33] Sarah has zero teams
[00:21:38] no no but yeah like yeah if you're like
[00:21:40] playing like aggravate yeah if not it's
[00:21:42] good because it has a high base attack
[00:21:43] which is like matters for her but a lot
[00:21:47] of times you kind of want energy too
[00:21:48] right so like you kind of want a hibis
[00:21:49] stack weapon that has energy but
[00:21:55] the Batters
[00:21:56] um
[00:21:57] also I released okay this dude this
[00:22:00] video is doing like really good for a
[00:22:01] second child video this [ __ ] dude I
[00:22:04] released uh well Mirai made it but I
[00:22:06] like I oversaw it so we released the um
[00:22:09] slowly going insane in the new 3.7 Abyss
[00:22:12] this is the
[00:22:13] thumbnails
[00:22:15] actually look at all the thumbnails he
[00:22:18] made so this is the one I chose but look
[00:22:19] at the other ones he also made
[00:22:21] what the [ __ ] is this
[00:22:27] yeah
[00:22:31] it feels like a waste because there's
[00:22:33] like two good thumbnails but yeah this
[00:22:36] is pretty [ __ ] good
[00:22:39] so anyways
[00:22:41] uh it is it is a good video I really
[00:22:43] like it go watch it I also think my main
[00:22:45] Channel video if you didn't see it
[00:22:48] but I already talked about that one
[00:22:50] which is why I didn't bring it up again
[00:22:51] but I will
[00:22:54] uh the abyss randomized video
[00:22:58] I thought I got copyright also amazing
[00:23:00] go watch that one too that's my [ __ ]
[00:23:01] you vid
[00:23:03] very very Banger this one is like took
[00:23:05] like years to make it's like super
[00:23:07] edited really good
[00:23:09] um so watch both
[00:23:20] okay
[00:23:25] perfect pause okay [ __ ] you yeah no
[00:23:29] editors popped off more I made this one
[00:23:30] check you made this one they both popped
[00:23:32] off uh and then
[00:23:34] I'm working on a guide right I'm working
[00:23:36] on guys on my like I'm working on
[00:23:37] somebody [ __ ] video it's hard I have
[00:23:39] so much [ __ ] and it's fine it is what it
[00:23:41] is but
[00:23:42] the thumbnail looks like those before
[00:23:43] and after celebrities
[00:23:47] okay
[00:23:55] how many it is do you have now okay so
[00:23:57] here's what happened here's the zox
[00:23:58] timeline so I used to just edit all my
[00:24:00] guys right but then I was like okay
[00:24:02] I still do well I have Alan tell me but
[00:24:04] I still do but the thing is I um
[00:24:07] was like okay I'm I feel like my Clips
[00:24:10] are like kind of funny sometimes but I
[00:24:12] don't know how to edit like stream
[00:24:13] videos so I kind of trialed a few people
[00:24:15] and now I have like a few that are
[00:24:17] trialing and then I think the um
[00:24:19] eventually like I don't know right now
[00:24:21] we have like three
[00:24:22] four
[00:24:24] but eventually it'll um
[00:24:26] it'll be more like
[00:24:28] stable because right now I'm still
[00:24:29] figuring things out so we're just seeing
[00:24:31] what people like and [ __ ] well I'm
[00:24:32] seeing what people like and [ __ ] and
[00:24:33] then whatever you guys respond to is
[00:24:35] what we keep doing
[00:24:38] and then for guides uh I have my main
[00:24:42] man Alan who's been here for like a year
[00:24:43] who like like edit the guys and send
[00:24:45] them to me and then I edit it again
[00:24:47] after
[00:24:49] um
[00:24:50] because I'm very perfectionist with guys
[00:24:52] so I end up remaking the whole [ __ ]
[00:24:53] video
[00:24:59] like guys the thing with guys and why I
[00:25:01] edit them myself for the longest time is
[00:25:02] because I kind of can't I I can't send
[00:25:06] someone like I can't like if I record a
[00:25:09] guide and then send it and then upload
[00:25:10] it
[00:25:11] there'll be like six things that I would
[00:25:13] want to change like I changed so much
[00:25:14] from a guide like I can literally open
[00:25:15] my [ __ ] I have a dog [ __ ] editing
[00:25:17] software don't use this by the way it's
[00:25:18] [ __ ] trash but like if you look at
[00:25:20] like any video like baiju guide right
[00:25:22] it's like I sent it to like my editor
[00:25:24] right Alan and it's like so this is like
[00:25:27] the what's in white is like what he sent
[00:25:29] me back right look at how many times I
[00:25:30] cut it after that's not his fault at all
[00:25:32] it's just there's so much [ __ ] I changed
[00:25:34] on my end to make the video like smaller
[00:25:36] or more like
[00:25:38] whatever so it's like I I add like a so
[00:25:41] much [ __ ]
[00:25:43] anyways
[00:25:44] anyways
[00:25:50] is White Castle good on hutau yeah sure
[00:25:53] if you have no better option sure it's
[00:25:55] there's better options but if you know
[00:25:57] if you're broke like if you don't have
[00:25:58] it's fine
[00:26:01] hopefully they got a dragon's Bane soon
[00:26:03] though
[00:26:04] at least like the prime
[00:26:11] Minister Wolf's guy didn't oh actually a
[00:26:13] few things someone asked what happened
[00:26:15] to Zay as they chilling he's just joined
[00:26:17] like uh editing he joined some agency
[00:26:19] thing in the Philippines so like good
[00:26:21] for him W so he doesn't have time to
[00:26:23] edit as much anymore so I don't really
[00:26:25] work with him uh but he's a giga Chad so
[00:26:28] I still love him uh and then
[00:26:33] what's the other thing I was gonna say
[00:26:35] um
[00:26:38] there's nothing else oh yeah regarding
[00:26:40] silver wolf so apparently okay okay
[00:26:43] listen so listen uh okay listen so
[00:26:48] listen
[00:26:49] listen apparently since Jin Yuan
[00:26:52] and silver wolf there was like
[00:26:57] okay you know over again I can like
[00:27:01] record [ __ ] before the characters out
[00:27:03] and then upload it apparently there's
[00:27:04] not for Star rail I just didn't know so
[00:27:06] I was like behind I was like [ __ ] it I
[00:27:07] might as well not make the guide that I
[00:27:09] had already recorded so I changed it
[00:27:11] it's still coming out but instead of
[00:27:12] being a guide it's like
[00:27:15] it is it's like a guy but like different
[00:27:17] I don't know how to explain it you'll
[00:27:18] see It'll be out in like a day
[00:27:21] um it's more like
[00:27:24] meta-analysis kind of not really it's
[00:27:26] more like how good is she and like build
[00:27:28] stuff so
[00:27:30] watch that if you want it's like a
[00:27:32] guidance exactly uh and then after the
[00:27:34] next video that's gonna be I'll hide
[00:27:35] them and Kazo so
[00:27:37] oh and then hung I've had that hung I
[00:27:39] recorded I just didn't upload it okay
[00:27:40] start real time whoa I can't wait to I
[00:27:43] could have said all of the [ __ ] while
[00:27:44] Auto battling wow thanks for not Autobot
[00:27:51] isn't that a normal guide okay yes but
[00:27:53] it's like masqueraded
[00:27:55] it's like also okay low-key I think also
[00:27:58] having time to cook and simmer and play
[00:28:00] her for longer helps instead of just
[00:28:02] like you know so yeah like for that type
[00:28:05] of video
[00:28:06] do you see that Among Us reference did I
[00:28:08] skipped past it I literally skipped past
[00:28:10] the Among Us reference
[00:28:18] wow press one if you're totally silver
[00:28:21] wolfing right now
[00:28:30] silver was good though I really like her
[00:28:32] I think the more I play her the more I
[00:28:33] like her and the better I think she is
[00:28:36] um
[00:28:37] but you know you can still just play
[00:28:39] pillow
[00:28:43] well I didn't [ __ ] dispatch again
[00:29:00] I have E2 silver rule for the event like
[00:29:02] on the energy rope honestly probably not
[00:29:04] no because E1 gives you energy and you
[00:29:06] get eight back per hit
[00:29:10] if you get your alt back within three
[00:29:12] turns you have 100 damage thing so if
[00:29:14] you can get your all back within three
[00:29:15] then no you don't need it
[00:29:21] on a scale of one does that stop I'm not
[00:29:24] 10 10. I'm not rating a character one to
[00:29:26] five stop it this isn't a [ __ ] 10 10
[00:29:29] video
[00:29:31] yeah I think this character is a three
[00:29:40] 10 10 sad isn't he still making content
[00:29:42] not sad if he moves to a game he likes
[00:29:45] more I was like good for him
[00:29:48] it's not like he died like he just
[00:29:51] wanted to like make comment for other
[00:29:52] [ __ ]
[00:29:53] I'm sad
[00:30:01] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[00:30:03] illusions of the past
[00:30:07] isn't the guy on the second Banner just
[00:30:09] Jean who luocho oh yeah well I actually
[00:30:13] didn't think about that wait it actually
[00:30:14] is gene
[00:30:16] yeah
[00:30:18] he does remind me that Gene
[00:30:21] no I just thought that I got my uh
[00:30:23] stamina I like make sure it doesn't
[00:30:25] count
[00:30:31] does someone make the enemy receive
[00:30:32] double the damage or no ah that is a bad
[00:30:36] question the death threat and the like
[00:30:39] all the okay listen best case scenario
[00:30:42] yes if you depth chart a bunch and like
[00:30:44] weakness get like but it's like that's
[00:30:45] not like that's not like a good question
[00:30:48] because it's like
[00:30:50] yeah I don't know but yes the death
[00:30:53] threat is very valuable
[00:30:55] thank you
[00:31:00] Brazilians non-quantum she does about
[00:31:02] exactly double okay yeah but yes yes but
[00:31:06] also it's like
[00:31:07] you also get more Shield Brit like you
[00:31:09] can actually break Shields now and you
[00:31:11] can like you can lower the speed of
[00:31:13] enemies and you can like [ __ ] be
[00:31:15] skill point efficient and you can
[00:31:17] [ __ ] like I don't know I feel like
[00:31:19] there's a lot more than just how much
[00:31:21] damage you're increasing but yeah
[00:31:24] uh when the [ __ ] does the week is that
[00:31:25] what is it Friday yeah I have time all
[00:31:27] right John what if I start with uh
[00:31:29] simulating your Universe no no is it too
[00:31:31] early for that is it too early in the
[00:31:33] Stream to simulate our universes
[00:31:35] should I finish the event
[00:31:37] how long do I have that 10 days I'll be
[00:31:39] fine
[00:32:00] you can stimul simulate mine because
[00:32:03] you're my universe
[00:32:06] huh do dailies my deals are done watch
[00:32:09] look literally literally use the
[00:32:11] consumable see they're done boom I eat
[00:32:13] rice boom
[00:32:15] [ __ ] I hate you
[00:32:20] yo Theo takes the prime Scarlet leaf
[00:32:23] takes the prime there's all those
[00:32:29] I like the way her attack sounds
[00:32:39] is there an account review in HSR maybe
[00:32:41] at some point but right now I high key
[00:32:43] okay
[00:32:44] Omega molten take but it's probably a
[00:32:47] cold take okay this is a bit louder sure
[00:32:49] no not a bit listen here's the here's
[00:32:52] the only problem with star rail account
[00:32:53] reviews maybe eventually if this game is
[00:32:54] still like Lively in like three months
[00:32:56] but for now it's like you kind of can't
[00:32:58] make a mistake like unless you're
[00:33:00] actually like griefing on purpose
[00:33:02] like you actually need a lot of teams in
[00:33:04] this game you can actually use more than
[00:33:06] one DPS unlike engine you can actually
[00:33:07] use like so many support characters that
[00:33:09] like unless you're literally in vesting
[00:33:11] in every single unit you own you
[00:33:14] probably didn't make a mistake that's
[00:33:15] like big like it's probably fine like I
[00:33:17] have a level 70 down hung silly and
[00:33:19] yanching and Jin Yuan it's like okay
[00:33:21] could I maybe progress a little bit
[00:33:23] further if I don't level one of them
[00:33:25] because I want to make videos on all
[00:33:26] yeah maybe I just need two or three but
[00:33:28] also it's like
[00:33:29] there's a lot of halls in the memory
[00:33:31] accounts where like wind is really
[00:33:32] [ __ ] good or Lightning's really
[00:33:33] [ __ ] good so it's like it's not like
[00:33:36] it's a mistake it's just
[00:33:38] it depends like if you're like rushing
[00:33:39] through [ __ ] yeah focused on two teams
[00:33:41] but other than that it's like you're
[00:33:43] probably fine
[00:33:56] what the [ __ ] is this
[00:33:58] what is this first time Hawkeye Starr
[00:34:01] rail chatter first message I can't
[00:34:03] believe I caught Jing Yuan and dripart
[00:34:05] in one Temple and got celi and bailu in
[00:34:07] one Temple as well my luck is so bad low
[00:34:10] low you know what just because you used
[00:34:12] LOL instead of LOL W that's a red flag
[00:34:14] 10 minute timeout [ __ ] you
[00:34:17] actually I'm bringing back the rule
[00:34:19] where anyone that Flexes in my chat we
[00:34:20] roll the dice dice roll we roll the dice
[00:34:25] one to six if it hits six 24-hour ban
[00:34:28] [ __ ]
[00:34:31] okay oh
[00:34:34] okay one more one that wasn't fair that
[00:34:36] wasn't fair that wasn't fair that wasn't
[00:34:36] fair that wasn't fair that was fair one
[00:34:38] more this is the fair one this is the
[00:34:40] real one
[00:34:42] never mind
[00:34:45] says you bro I got okay listen
[00:34:48] sure I got silly in my first ever single
[00:34:51] poll sure okay sure but but but it's not
[00:34:55] like I got like four four stars in Two
[00:34:57] pulls that's what that dude got in 20.
[00:34:59] you know let's count silver wolf okay
[00:35:01] let's count one two three four five five
[00:35:06] six seven eight nine guess what's after
[00:35:11] nine ten oh [ __ ] eleven what comes after
[00:35:13] that twelve oh [ __ ] 13 14 15 what is
[00:35:17] fine fruit sixteen then we got wealth
[00:35:20] and guess what I already had welt and I
[00:35:22] don't even have every [ __ ] five star
[00:35:23] so I I got well this was useless okay
[00:35:26] because I already have one and I'm not
[00:35:28] activating Idols I don't think oh
[00:35:29] [ __ ] 25 pages of pulls just for one
[00:35:32] five star that I wanted
[00:35:38] yeah 30 [ __ ] Pages bro 30 [ __ ]
[00:35:41] pages from genuine 30.
[00:35:43] it wasn't fun
[00:35:46] it's five for Paige so 150 wow that's
[00:35:49] actually I mean double soft fitting
[00:35:50] makes sense but still that's 150 bro
[00:35:54] 150 pulls I just wanted one
[00:35:57] 150.
[00:36:00] yeah it's actually Karma
[00:36:03] that's not deserved
[00:36:06] not dessert
[00:36:08] anyways
[00:36:13] silver wolves what's the answering his
[00:36:14] best like own anything there's a crit
[00:36:16] damage or a lot of attack or damage so
[00:36:17] like for four star I really like
[00:36:19] foreplay and for five star obviously the
[00:36:21] like icon with his face on it's good but
[00:36:23] it's not that good like it's good for
[00:36:24] him because it gets good damage but the
[00:36:25] rest of the effect is ass so I don't
[00:36:27] recommend like I sure I'm sure we'll get
[00:36:29] a better one at some point if not uh
[00:36:30] this one's still good but the Creator is
[00:36:32] overcapped like as soon as like a
[00:36:33] business for your article it's like too
[00:36:35] much good rate but foreplay is really
[00:36:36] good this one's pretty good too uh River
[00:36:39] flow and then the one with his face on
[00:36:40] it obviously is good but it's kind of
[00:36:42] like I feel like the light cones bad but
[00:36:44] it's good for him because he wants good
[00:36:45] damage
[00:36:48] hi socks do you have a hashtag for fan

[00:39:13] so people don't [ __ ] use it without
[00:39:15] my
[00:39:16] at
[00:39:17] ziox
[00:39:20] underscore not cool
[00:39:23] it has no legs
[00:39:27] yeah I mean okay like
[00:39:36] artist works foreign
[00:39:47] why do you say okay like okay what
[00:39:50] I say okay yeah
[00:39:53] anyways what do I want for Japan uh we
[00:39:56] can do oh yes
[00:39:59] I wanted to play yancheng we could just
[00:40:00] silly brute force it
[00:40:06] no
[00:40:08] wow I can't wait to watch another
[00:40:10] streamer play Sealy
[00:40:12] sorry all right silly uh she's not like
[00:40:15] the best geared but you know it's honest
[00:40:16] work what is this should I get this
[00:40:19] I probably should there's also crit
[00:40:21] damage right here dude this is so
[00:40:22] expensive dude literally
[00:40:25] I would donate I would literally I
[00:40:28] wouldn't think I would put I would okay
[00:40:29] I would go make a I would start a farm
[00:40:32] okay start a farm and I would be the a
[00:40:35] beat salesman I would literally have a
[00:40:36] beet Farm a potato farm and a [ __ ]
[00:40:39] cucumber Farm I would I would win World
[00:40:41] prizes for the biggest cucumbers that I
[00:40:43] farm and then I would trade my entire
[00:40:45] Farm in just to get [ __ ] eight hunt
[00:40:48] Trace mats just for the trace mats I
[00:40:51] would trade my whole farm so when I when
[00:40:54] I ask if I should get this it's because
[00:40:55] I don't want to farm more
[00:40:58] oh I should probably level my light Cone
[00:41:00] first that's probably more important for
[00:41:01] yanching

[00:41:04] God I remembered because we want to play
[00:41:05] yanching today a bit later but okay I'll

[01:06:19] less than bailoo heal
[01:06:24] oh
[01:06:33] the Japan kind of hurts
[01:06:38] gapard
[01:06:42] mess with me
[01:06:49] missions of the past keep the moment
[01:06:51] wait what was that 410k
[01:06:55] was that because the shield I don't the
[01:06:57] [ __ ] I
[01:07:01] yeah
[01:07:05] break yeah
[01:07:10] um
[01:07:11] that means that doesn't matter
[01:07:13] [Music]
[01:07:24] that was a really good run good team
[01:07:28] Really Gonna Run
[01:07:30] uh I kind of don't care about I know
[01:07:33] world three is good because this set is
[01:07:34] good but I kind of don't care about
[01:07:35] world three so we're only gonna claim
[01:07:37] one
[01:07:40] that's okay
[01:07:42] that sucks okay okay oh
[01:07:46] I mean we're not using a four star right
[01:07:50] now
[01:07:52] all right
[01:07:58] that's the Jeff 77 been enjoying your
[01:08:00] streams these days zodge okay you're bad
[01:08:03] see you in uh 10 minutes
[01:08:06] enjoy the time out
[01:08:08] oh wait what the [ __ ] did I just get I
[01:08:10] just got a bunch of new [ __ ] wait where
[01:08:11] is it
[01:08:12] yo wait where's all the nutrition I just
[01:08:14] got
[01:08:16] okay let's just look through all of them
[01:08:18] boom that sucks any energy ropes any
[01:08:21] energy ropes in the chat room any energy
[01:08:26] uh
[01:08:27] uh no I mean
[01:08:29] no no I don't want that
[01:08:32] okay these suck
[01:08:41] wait why was this oh because this uh
[01:08:48] I probably want this one
[01:08:51] yeah
[01:08:52] okay so we did what was the only
[01:08:54] difficulty we didn't do is four four
[01:08:58] we're gonna do instead or six half a
[01:09:01] year already pipped
[01:09:04] five is good for a silver wolf
[01:09:07] however I kind of don't care I want to
[01:09:09] do six
[01:09:11] because it hurts how Soto is good for
[01:09:13] every single character in the video game
[01:09:17] then icon versus wealth which one's
[01:09:18] better for a silver wolf event while
[01:09:21] Cyclone is better if you have enough hit
[01:09:22] rate
[01:09:24] but even then the energy is kind of
[01:09:26] annoying but until then go event like on
[01:09:27] event like one's more consistent
[01:09:28] eventually you can swap though
[01:09:32] one sec I rolled over my [ __ ] wire
[01:09:33] all right
[01:09:37] six
[01:09:40] actually let's do five okay we'll get
[01:09:42] silver rolls piece today
[01:09:54] you think this is doable we might get
[01:09:55] [ __ ]
[01:10:00] why using Sealy when E4 dad hung and
[01:10:02] sushiang what do you mean
[01:10:06] silly is better than Siri's broken
[01:10:08] Silly's like actually broken
[01:10:18] okay we really need a good Quantum ball
[01:10:20] maybe we just do world six actually
[01:10:30] all right let's do it

[01:32:56] with a good Quantum ball
[01:33:00] hitter rate okay I mean it's not the
[01:33:02] right set for hit rate it's a ball it's

[01:51:13] of being uh uh uh uh uh uh online
[01:51:16] influencer that's what I am yeah no big
[01:51:18] deal I'm an adult video maker a throat
[01:51:20] artist I think the best part is I can
[01:51:22] sleep whenever the [ __ ] I want so what I
[01:51:24] do now is instead of like it kind of
[01:51:26] [ __ ] my sleep schedule and my cicada
[01:51:28] Rhythm which isn't good for my health
[01:51:30] but it means that I never have to be
[01:51:33] alone with a thought so I can just over
[01:51:36] stimulate my brain and then go to bed
[01:51:38] when I'm really tired so I just pass out
[01:51:40] and I don't have to like lay in bed for
[01:51:42] six hours be like wow I can't sleep and
[01:51:43] then it you just like watch videos and
[01:51:45] you're like okay I'm not sleeping and
[01:51:46] then you're like oh [ __ ] I have a class
[01:51:48] in two hours I might as well just not
[01:51:49] sleep at this point and then you sleep
[01:51:51] for like when you're like an hour away
[01:51:52] from having to wake up you actually fall
[01:51:54] asleep and then your alarm wakes you up
[01:51:55] when you're and then you're super tired
[01:51:57] like why I shouldn't have slept anyways
[01:51:58] because the quality of your sleep made
[01:51:59] you more tired than if you hadn't
[01:52:00] thought and then you're [ __ ]
[01:52:05] okay we need a little bit more of the
[01:52:08] purple
[01:52:10] one more to be precise so let's go do a
[01:52:13] little bit more
[01:52:16] it's still bad about your for your
[01:52:18] health yes but you know what else is bad
[01:52:20] for your health
[01:52:21] gotcha games
[01:52:23] it is what it is
[01:52:25] look it's temporary I'll be better it's
[01:52:27] temporary
[01:52:31] that's a sign of ADHD bro you say
[01:52:33] everything I do is outside of ADHD
[01:52:35] everything's a sign
[01:52:40] everything's aside
[01:52:43] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[01:52:46] illusions of the past
[01:52:49] okay no but this is also a thing that
[01:52:51] like I think my dad has
[01:52:54] that he's talked about that I definitely
[01:52:56] have I cannot my brain okay
[01:52:59] sometimes I can no thoughts hit empty
[01:53:01] but usually my brain doesn't shut the
[01:53:04] [ __ ] up like I love it he's a cool guy
[01:53:07] but like look my brain is golden but
[01:53:09] sometimes you just like literally
[01:53:12] like I can't like I'll be like in bed
[01:53:16] and I'll just like I can't stop thinking
[01:53:18] about things and it's just like it like
[01:53:20] and that's why you like I think his
[01:53:21] punch to leave a notepad next to your
[01:53:22] bed or your phone but then your phone
[01:53:24] kind of [ __ ] with your sleep but
[01:53:25] everyone's on their phone like I'm on my
[01:53:26] phone all the time anyway so it doesn't
[01:53:27] matter but like I kind of need to like
[01:53:29] write down ideas like as I'm like dude I
[01:53:31] just can't like he literally get help
[01:53:36] is that the same for most people I feel
[01:53:38] like it is but I don't know I only know
[01:53:40] one person and that's me
[01:53:42] me
[01:53:50] me
[01:53:53] hello
[01:53:55] because she like yeah
[01:53:58] she moves like a Speed Demon
[01:54:09] that's not ADHD that's what normal
[01:54:11] people do and then have ADHD what
[01:54:14] does that even mean
[01:54:31] yeah I'm not okay uh not not okay not uh
[01:54:36] not to pin all my problems on an
[01:54:38] external source
[01:54:39] but
[01:54:41] um I do think I do think we are being
[01:54:42] forced to have no attention span because
[01:54:45] of tick tock and just how YouTube is now
[01:54:47] and how everything is I think like it's
[01:54:49] like literally being downloaded into our
[01:54:51] brains like even people who are like the
[01:54:54] most Normy of normies like whatever dude
[01:54:57] any media you consume now is like
[01:55:02] as soon as you're talking subtitles on
[01:55:04] every word because for some reason you
[01:55:06] can't understand English despite
[01:55:07] speaking it since the day you were born
[01:55:09] and then it just [ __ ] forces you to
[01:55:11] like think like that I think it's
[01:55:13] actually like yeah I'm par yeah I don't
[01:55:16] know
[01:55:17] like you okay but I have a marginal
[01:55:20] amount of reach compared to like
[01:55:23] the whole platform
[01:55:27] English is not my native language okay
[01:55:29] but the same thing for any other
[01:55:31] language like I've watched French videos
[01:55:33] it's the same [ __ ] thing subtitle
[01:55:35] fast [ __ ] oh today we are [ __ ]
[01:55:38] raiding our baguette sizes and then it's
[01:55:40] just like boom
[01:55:43] so I see what's the same for most
[01:55:45] languages
[01:55:49] people choose to consume that I mean no
[01:55:51] like okay yes but no
[01:55:55] listen listen okay let's see let's say
[01:55:58] you're like you're a kid right okay
[01:55:59] you're like you're like 14. okay you're
[01:56:00] like you're an adolescent you're like oh
[01:56:02] I'm 14. I love gentian impact you go to
[01:56:05] school right all your friends are like
[01:56:07] raving about like oh do you see this on
[01:56:09] your [ __ ] social media platform then
[01:56:12] you're gonna go see it because you wanna
[01:56:13] fit in and then you turn into the Zoomer
[01:56:15] brain unless you're just like no I'm
[01:56:17] different and then you just like nobody
[01:56:19] likes you no I'm kidding but like I I
[01:56:22] feel like you have to conform I don't
[01:56:24] know
[01:56:25] who humans are social you did you just
[01:56:27] conform
[01:56:30] we are social beings we want to fit in
[01:56:39] but also it's like it's what works right
[01:56:41] like I don't fault Like I Do It Like
[01:56:43] It's what works like if if more people
[01:56:45] are gonna watch my video if I [ __ ]
[01:56:47] fast forward it then I'm gonna fast

[01:57:12] dudes knew that like three was true but
[01:57:14] then all the actors said four was true

[02:42:41] I don't know if that works
[02:42:44] okay we have to change our plan okay new

[02:45:07] all right we're gonna talk about the 30
[02:45:08] unbanned requests no
[02:45:11] I don't feel like looking at them
[02:45:13] there's been a decrease in viewer
[02:45:15] quality recently I don't want to look at
[02:45:16] them
[02:45:24] uh what was it gonna do
[02:45:27] I don't know okay
[02:45:38] how come I don't know
[02:45:40] who's husband
[02:45:43] stop doing all your in-game messages I
[02:45:45] don't have that many
[02:45:46] I mean okay wait why are there dot dot
[02:45:49] dot there wait what
[02:45:59] what's up genuine
[02:46:01] ah
[02:46:04] okay I'm gonna be honest I'm not gonna
[02:46:05] read all that
[02:46:07] but I would be interested
[02:46:19] but this is a quest
[02:46:24] oh I will head over immediately I guess
[02:46:26] that was a lie
[02:46:28] yeah I guess it's not a quest
[02:46:30] do you want to enter the foreign
[02:46:32] Loki we should probably do more from
[02:46:34] memory chaos today but I feel like my
[02:46:36] support characters are like squishy
[02:46:39] also my [ __ ] did my my main
[02:46:42] characters talents I mean no no six
[02:46:44] isn't bad well four plus two but you
[02:46:47] know
[02:46:53] wait this is good actually no it's
[02:46:55] Trailblazer attack never mind but the
[02:46:56] energy is good
[02:46:57] I thought it was the other characters
[02:46:58] attack anyway
[02:47:01] should probably get this up
[02:47:04] like all of these up
[02:47:13] cruising in the Stellar sea yes it's
[02:47:15] amazing
[02:47:25] is my Natalia leveled
[02:47:27] I mean okay surely four is fine right
[02:47:29] surely we can heal
[02:47:31] surely yeah surely we're fine right
[02:47:52] okay let's do a little bit of these
[02:47:56] gyms yeah I know Fire EMS is killing
[02:47:59] suck but isn't there one of them that
[02:48:00] increases the damage of this I forget
[02:48:01] which one
[02:48:03] like I don't care about her damage but
[02:48:04] I'm pretty sure one of her traces
[02:48:05] increases the damage rest right
[02:48:11] yeah this one
[02:48:17] they probably want to level it
[02:48:19] okay let me go get uh abundance things
[02:48:32] foreign
[02:48:39] I'm sorry
[02:48:46] the answer of this song is good but Feng
[02:48:48] plays it on repeat so I can't listen to
[02:48:50] it anymore
[02:48:52] like it's still a banger but I think
[02:48:53] I've heard it like 256 times
[02:48:58] and at some point she's just like big
[02:49:00] big stage
[02:49:05] this is double speed
[02:49:14] a big big stage illusions of the past
[02:49:23] disappear a moment oh the dreams come
[02:49:25] true
[02:49:27] I don't wear shampoo
[02:49:30] I don't know kind of weird lyrics I
[02:49:33] don't know why you admit that you don't
[02:49:34] use shampoo but that's all good
[02:49:43] shampoo mains
[02:49:46] shampoo means molding in chat
[02:49:57] s of the past
[02:50:02] did it would be funny you know
[02:50:04] everyone's like oh you let rerun you let
[02:50:06] rerun can you imagine okay I will I will
[02:50:09] donate all of my money to gentian impact
[02:50:12] charity if if okay if imagine if hoyo
[02:50:16] does the thing okay listen imagine if
[02:50:17] Hoyle does a thing where like 3.8 beta
[02:50:20] right they basically like hype it up as
[02:50:22] being like a Eula thing okay so that
[02:50:24] anyone who's like leaking stuff they
[02:50:25] think Eula is coming back okay and then
[02:50:27] they put a YULA teaser but then when it
[02:50:30] comes to time for the 3.8 live stream
[02:50:31] boom a child rerun shall we run nothing
[02:50:34] else no no no no you look and then they
[02:50:37] just baited everyone
[02:50:38] think about it
[02:50:42] they're they're not even okay if three
[02:50:45] let's say let's say hypothetically 3.8
[02:50:47] doesn't have new characters if that's
[02:50:49] true then why the [ __ ] would they need a
[02:50:50] beta so what they could do is they could
[02:50:52] test they could literally bait all the
[02:50:54] leakers they could bait all of them okay
[02:50:56] by putting Eula there and then not
[02:50:59] releasing Your Love five head
[02:51:02] s
[02:51:04] but we don't talk about leaks
[02:51:08] from the sea of butterflies
[02:51:12] dude new a business new abyss and Genji
[02:51:15] nowadays is like hey if you don't have
[02:51:17] pyro dendro and hydro go [ __ ] yourself
[02:51:19] sideways oh also you need a Healer and a
[02:51:22] shielder or you get a reset for 10 hours
[02:51:24] you know I'm fighting the [ __ ]
[02:51:26] constipated beasts so do you really want
[02:51:28] to play Eula against that be honest be
[02:51:30] [ __ ] honest
[02:51:32] no
[02:51:38] who's next
[02:51:44] nice that's actually really lucky
[02:52:04] uh
[02:52:08] uh Natasha
[02:52:16] it's probably a waste because uh
[02:52:18] probably gonna Venture for Lucha but it
[02:52:20] is what it is
[02:52:23] um actually she has a cleanse so she's
[02:52:25] better than bailu actually
[02:52:51] I mean yeah bronya also has a cleanse
[02:52:53] and brawny is like the most broken
[02:52:54] character so it depends
[02:52:59] do you want to enter the forgot
[02:53:02] wait John what the [ __ ] is uh ten and
[02:53:04] nine do you need a cleanse for nine and
[02:53:06] ten
[02:53:10] well respectfully bailu is a little baby
[02:53:13] and Natalia has fat titties dude why did
[02:53:16] you type that honestly I regret uh that
[02:53:19] makes me regret viping you why the [ __ ]
[02:53:22] did you type that
[02:53:23] that doesn't make her a better character
[02:53:27] that does not make her a better
[02:53:29] character
[02:53:36] that is a good point though
[02:53:40] well I don't even remember if her name's
[02:53:41] Natalia are Natasha anymore it's Natasha
[02:53:43] right Natasha yeah okay

[02:55:02] instead RG you like kind of sucks not
[02:55:04] it's not his fault it's just our suck
[02:55:07] true

[02:55:22] Silly I mean quantum
[02:55:24] here uh
[02:55:42] okay I think I like this team idea and
[02:55:45] then I could go with lightning without
[02:55:46] implementing it because they're
[02:55:47] lightning weak so I could do Ting Yoon
[02:55:49] nobody need healer by Lou
[02:55:52] probably wanna Shield too yeah I think
[02:55:55] this team works really well
[02:55:59] yeah I like this I actually like this a
[02:56:01] lot this is also why
[02:56:07] I think people kind of like obsess over

[03:07:38] it would be the best content if I risked
[03:07:40] it oh thank God I thought I wasn't gonna
[03:07:42] kill because the start looked bad all

[03:10:53] bought for this
[03:10:56] break this ice supply yes sir
[03:11:05] okay heal
[03:11:08] good timing
[03:11:13] foreign
[03:11:30] why do they go four times in a row
[03:11:39] practice is over
[03:11:42] Sports descent
[03:11:48] where's the Balu Clans who the [ __ ]
[03:11:51] cares about cleansing in this floor wow
[03:11:53] oh no ice debuff wow oh no I'm not
[03:11:57] literally about to win this turn
[03:12:00] or maybe not actually do I have enough
[03:12:01] skill uh might not be actually
[03:12:05] no I can't win this turn next turn yeah
[03:12:08] next turn
[03:12:15] wait I don't know he ate his friend I
[03:12:17] could have hit him
[03:12:21] oh my God we actually could have won
[03:12:22] that turn I didn't know he's about to
[03:12:23] [ __ ] eat his friend
[03:12:25] all right um
[03:12:29] so I could kill him
[03:12:32] but if I don't kill him then I get the
[03:12:33] heal which makes me more ready for the
[03:12:35] next battle so hopefully he doesn't die
[03:12:36] hopefully wait that's perfect okay
[03:12:39] that's good I got the heal
[03:12:41] oh my that was so good okay and now he
[03:12:43] dies
[03:12:45] okay really good really good
[03:12:48] nice let's do it again when you're
[03:12:51] leveled up
[03:12:56] okay
[03:12:57] [Music]
[03:12:58] um
[03:13:01] you think yanching is choose a build yes
[03:13:03] his floor is really high
[03:13:07] because you got a [ __ ] out of value
[03:13:08] just by giving him a bit of damage
[03:13:09] because he has like innate Blizzards for
[03:13:11] his head so he starts with like 10
[03:13:12] million crate so he's pretty easy to
[03:13:14] play all right we're three starting this
[03:13:16] unless I [ __ ] up but
[03:13:19] this this
[03:13:21] say hi
[03:13:22] does he have ads at the start he does
[03:13:25] okay we're gonna do this
[03:13:32] trickier to crack trickier to crack
[03:13:35] sorry
[03:13:38] time for a plan
[03:13:41] this is double speed
[03:13:44] is this a soup team yeah
[03:13:50] try alt yeah
[03:13:54] did you voice silver wolf yeah how can

[03:14:21] a one-time Enemy No I can't break these
[03:14:23] guys Shields
[03:14:25] might be able to just kill him though
[03:14:33] well that did not kill him but practice
[03:14:35] is over
[03:14:37] it's descent
[03:14:41] okay nice should I kill this guy
[03:14:44] uh surely we can tank it
[03:14:55] [ __ ] it I'm greedy surely we can thank
[03:14:57] it
[03:14:59] okay that was more than I thought listen
[03:15:01] listen we can still take it it's fine
[03:15:03] yeah we're fine that was actually still
[03:15:05] worth though uh I'm gonna heal yanching
[03:15:09] because the silver dies are just res oh
[03:15:12] okay we're chilling
[03:15:27] that was good so we're so good I think
[03:15:29] we're three starting this easily
[03:15:32] that's good
[03:15:45] I was gonna do this just to be safe just
[03:15:47] in case
[03:15:48] well there was nothing 16 18. it's the
[03:15:51] wrong [ __ ] game doesn't even make
[03:15:53] sense here
[03:16:00] well I still have to kill these guys
[03:16:01] dumb
[03:16:03] practice is over

[03:16:43] no but Yeti's better second [ __ ] can I
[03:16:47] even plot Quantum in this I guess I can
[03:17:00] because if I'm smart I do this this and
[03:17:03] then I just [ __ ] ice her and then
[03:17:06] like no actually no no no no I
[03:17:08] definitely do this and then this yeah

[03:17:57] Healer so bye Luke
[03:18:05] or probably
[03:18:08] this
[03:18:11] kind of want a shield on first half so I
[03:18:13] feel like I'm gonna die
[03:18:15] I feel like one of my bronyas is gonna
[03:18:17] die
[03:18:35] use your wealth no uh it's not too much
[03:18:39] investment like I yeah no I need to
[03:18:42] level another like conophonism
[03:18:45] foreign
[03:18:55] yeah I want to put MC first half
[03:18:59] but the problem is that yanching needs a
[03:19:02] shield

[03:19:08] around we'll see I I feel like I'm gonna

[03:24:01] I'm gonna attack the counter actually
[03:24:08] maybe that was dumb in hindsight but I
[03:24:11] feel like that was worth it
[03:24:22] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[03:24:24] illusions of the past you took the baby

[03:25:27] know a lot I'm okay
[03:25:51] so definitely kill the odds but I kind
[03:25:54] of feel like not killing them so
[03:25:58] I always laugh when you waste resin on
[03:26:01] the million and then waste nothing
[03:26:03] on desert positions of the past I didn't
[03:26:07] create again
[03:26:08] okay how am I not creating any burst

[03:31:50] don't need to run a shield with what if
[03:31:52] you don't need to run a shield with

[03:59:56] okay
[04:00:11] okay I wasn't sure if we'd win or not
[04:00:14] like what the [ __ ] is that
[04:00:18] what the [ __ ] is that garbage
[04:00:43] [ __ ] it
[04:00:46] if I can't read the stats maybe they'll
[04:00:48] be better
[04:00:49] that's wind I this [ __ ] symbols next
[04:00:52] to them this doesn't even hide it okay
[04:00:53] this is [ __ ] terrible all right well
[04:00:55] we got nothing
[04:00:56] I thought that would help but you can
[04:00:59] still see the [ __ ] symbols all right
[04:01:01] well
[04:01:03] and it still sucked
[04:01:08] well at least we unlocked [ __ ]
[04:01:10] defense wow

[04:02:00] whoa whoa
[04:02:07] okay
[04:02:22] we'll use the fuel I need to get my
[04:02:24] genuine let's do a lighting Relic
[04:02:38] Japanese genuine why I've heard it
[04:02:40] actually I've heard it
[04:02:46] but I'm also uh
[04:02:47] English Jin Yuan simp so I think they're
[04:02:50] both good
[04:02:57] butter
[04:02:59] this is double speed also I think uh
[04:03:03] okay so I think either next street
[04:03:05] either tomorrow in two days probably in
[04:03:07] two days but after tomorrow
[04:03:09] I'm gonna do a pretty big Gadget stream
[04:03:11] and then the day after I'm gonna do a
[04:03:12] star rail stream again which might be
[04:03:16] with like
[04:03:18] some [ __ ] to give away but I'm not sure
[04:03:20] yet just because I saw other people
[04:03:22] doing it I don't know if I'm doing it
[04:03:27] I mean to be fair technically tomorrow
[04:03:29] is in two days because technically
[04:03:31] technically it's it's it's technically
[04:03:33] today is tomorrow technically so
[04:03:36] technically tomorrow's in two days true
[04:03:40] because tomorrow for me would be later
[04:03:42] tonight
[04:03:45] because it's like past midnight so in my
[04:03:47] head it's still yesterday if it's past
[04:03:49] midnight and you haven't slept it's
[04:03:50] still yesterday true
[04:03:56] so technically
[04:03:58] if I say in two days that's tomorrow
[04:04:00] this is double speed
[04:04:06] yeah
[04:04:08] it's fine it's fun
[04:04:11] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[04:04:14] illusions of the past
[04:04:17] I stream most of the twitch streams two
[04:04:19] times a week okay listen I've been busy
[04:04:21] but no I stream more often than two
[04:04:23] times a week and I'm gonna stream
[04:04:24] gentian either tomorrow or in two days
[04:04:35] after
[04:04:37] literally literally one day another
[04:04:40] question and then start real and then
[04:04:41] [ __ ] back to whichever one so ratio
[04:04:45] and I'm working on a bunch of videos so
[04:04:47] double ratio you want a triple one I
[04:04:49] dare you test me
[04:05:01] okay uh we did not get a genuine piece
[04:05:05] I am extremely disappointed and my day

[04:06:12] edited now what am I see that
[04:06:15] anyways
[04:06:17] so I have to upload that
[04:06:21] um
[04:06:22] debated I mean I've only heard
[04:06:25] yeah I've decided to play Austin because
[04:06:27] I have so many games I need to stream
[04:06:28] anyways that why the [ __ ] could I like
[04:06:30] if I'm gonna stream an extra game I'll
[04:06:31] stream like Persona like Elden ring or
[04:06:33] something I'm not gonna like yeah
[04:06:35] that game I feel like gets ruined with
[04:06:37] like spoilers and also I've heard bad
[04:06:38] things about the community so why would
[04:06:40] I stream it
[04:06:42] ah
[04:06:47] this is double speed
[04:07:00] time
[04:07:04] three percent I have for some I
[04:07:06] literally have the game I have the
[04:07:07] physical copy of [ __ ] persona but
[04:07:14] yeah
[04:07:16] I'll play it yet
[04:07:18] how am I winning this by the way
[04:07:30] laughs
[04:07:33] at me
[04:07:45] this is double speed
[04:07:55] no no I mean okay bro what the [ __ ] is
[04:07:59] this this is the wrong main stat and
[04:08:01] it's a four star
[04:08:06] foreign
[04:08:16] it feels like a waste
[04:08:20] Vermilion all over again oh where
[04:08:23] no it's not like Vermillion it's
[04:08:26] actually nothing like Vermillion
[04:08:37] time to 10 for one oh wait good [ __ ]
[04:08:39] take actually actually a good take for
[04:08:41] once actually a good take from Chad for
[04:08:43] once for the first time ever
[04:08:53] all right where the [ __ ] is it uh
[04:08:55] inventory
[04:09:02] should I have a feeling I'm gonna have
[04:09:04] so much [ __ ] resin for my next stream
[04:09:06] but don't ask how
[04:09:10] okay we solved all these
[04:09:12] I know you guys can't see the stats but
[04:09:14] just trust me that they're bad
[04:09:18] thank you
[04:09:38] all right
[04:09:44] all right 10 for one time we're gonna
[04:09:46] start with uh I really need a lightning
[04:09:48] Ball but I'd rather just Farm it from
[04:09:50] universe so I don't think we're gonna do
[04:09:51] that I think I'm gonna get a hand
[04:09:53] forging on Boom watch it's gonna have
[04:09:55] criterate crit damage speed and HP
[04:10:04] okay good enough maybe
[04:10:21] okay maybe the the ring we got that I
[04:10:23] said good enough maybe might get crit
[04:10:25] damage unironically so we'll see maybe
[04:10:27] I'll get her damage I like to use it
[04:10:31] let's see
[04:10:33] okay
[04:10:35] all right never mind
[04:10:41] what if we salvaged another ten one two
[04:10:43] three four
[04:10:45] five
[04:10:47] six seven
[04:10:50] eight nine ten
[04:10:52] eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
[04:10:54] sixteen Seventeen eighteen nineteen
[04:10:55] twenty
[04:11:11] all right surely whatever happens it
[04:11:13] can't be worse than what just happened
[04:11:15] so this has to be a victory okay it was
[04:11:17] worse uh okay uh what if we all right
[04:11:21] let's do a ball [ __ ] it [ __ ] it
[04:11:24] we'll get our lightning ball and it'll
[04:11:25] be good
[04:11:26] oh
[04:11:28] maybe maybe maybe maybe not lightning
[04:11:30] but lightning and Quantum are what we
[04:11:32] need so so so so so actually it could be
[04:11:34] good actually could be good
[04:11:37] because our Sealy ball right now sucks
[04:11:40] balls
[04:11:45] so maybe just maybe
[04:11:49] this one will be better
[04:11:51] Auto add [ __ ] it
[04:12:11] okay I mean ah
[04:12:23] it's like technically better
[04:12:26] because we probably need more crit that
[04:12:27] yeah like the crit damage is nice you
[04:12:29] get some crit rate on this right
[04:12:33] it's like technically better
[04:12:36] it's fine it's fine it's fine it's
[04:12:41] usable it's doable when are you and envy
[04:12:45] getting married I still need to contact
[04:12:47] everyone for a date so if you could
[04:12:49] hurry up that would be great we're not
[04:12:51] getting married
[04:12:53] foreign
[04:12:59] I'm never using this right
[04:13:02] wait why does this give us nothing in
[04:13:04] terms of XV
[04:13:07] whoa yeah
[04:13:15] [ __ ] it might as well Plus 15.
[04:13:25] wait why am I this broke
[04:13:27] okay I'm never using this never using
[04:13:30] this
[04:13:31] never using this actually I might use
[04:13:33] that
[04:13:34] I might use that I might use that
[04:13:42] oh
[04:13:44] okay that was good nice uh like it I
[04:13:47] mean it's okay it started bad but 18
[04:13:49] crew damage four attacks
[04:13:52] it's actually not bad actually not bad
[04:13:55] yo basically a one to two ratio
[04:13:59] we take that
[04:14:01] basically one to two
[04:14:03] take that for now obviously uh some of
[04:14:06] our pieces like you know are are this
[04:14:08] and this uh no not this and our uh our
[04:14:10] body and our boots are so mid but you
[04:14:12] know
[04:14:13] that's fine
[04:14:19] I wish I could use these speed boots
[04:14:22] but it's fine
[04:14:24] I'll get attacked boot someday I have
[04:14:26] [ __ ] three speed ones but no attack
[04:14:27] all good
[04:14:43] this could actually be good I might as
[04:14:45] well plus like ate it
[04:14:47] Am I Ever Gonna use this
[04:14:50] no
[04:14:51] actually maybe what if I played
[04:14:55] no never using that
[04:14:58] okay that was the dumbest mistake I've
[04:15:00] ever made in my life I'm sorry I'm sorry
[04:15:02] I'm sorry I'm sorry it's only a mistake
[04:15:04] if you miss if I hit it would have been
[04:15:06] a smart investment
[04:15:13] the day reset
[04:15:16] my seal is dead
