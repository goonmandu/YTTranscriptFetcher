[00:17:15] oops anyways as the 2
[00:17:18] one you're welcome Z archives we're
[00:17:21] going to make um I think the reason this
[00:17:23] is a I think what I'm doing is okay chat
[00:17:27] main channel will be duuke second
[00:17:28] Channel
[00:17:30] if the arino trailer is good we're going
[00:17:31] to react to it and
[00:17:33] aventurine like t aventurine uh like
[00:17:37] mini guide on the second Channel I was
[00:17:39] going to do a main Channel video but
[00:17:40] like I kind of don't want to I've been
[00:17:42] burnt out recently I don't know why like
[00:17:44] I'm a lot more motivated now but like
[00:17:46] finishing the duuke video is like
[00:17:47] actually drained all my
[00:17:50] [ __ ] but anyways I'll probably I'll
[00:17:53] probably make a main I'll def okay not
[00:17:55] probably I'll definitely make a main sh
[00:17:56] video for Robin so it's fine
[00:18:03] Z say lament for me okay Shia's birthday
[00:18:05] is in 26 minutes it's not technically
[00:18:08] yet it's not technically yet wait did
[00:18:11] the feline event end oh no it's not it's
[00:18:14] not done okay o lat line overflow if
[00:18:17] that was yesterday I did not see
[00:18:20] it
[00:18:25] bet do I have any XP box
[00:18:29] probably do it
[00:18:30] tomorrow anyways
[00:18:35] um Chad look at this [ __ ] chat look at
[00:18:39] this
[00:18:40] 4150 Jesus Christ are you watching that
[00:18:43] be honest probably not ta equal
[00:18:50] ta that's a lot of unfair hate because
[00:18:52] while it often times isn't I don't know
[00:18:55] dude [ __ ] melt though no no all that bad
[00:18:59] dude I had to trim out the whole
[00:19:01] Elemental gauge theory part cuz I
[00:19:04] started yapping so much um I basically
[00:19:08] dumbed it down as one like so
[00:19:11] effectively every cryo you eat with with
[00:19:15] with forward melt is um four like you're
[00:19:18] eating four times more cryo than you'd
[00:19:19] be eating Hydro because it's uh one U of
[00:19:21] pyro eats two U of cryo but one U of
[00:19:23] pyro only it'ss 0.5 U of hydro if it's
[00:19:27] like forward and in reverse but that's
[00:19:29] like I don't like that sentence cuz it's
[00:19:30] not really like it's kind of misleading
[00:19:32] like it's true but it's like you're not
[00:19:35] you're realistically not going to melt a
[00:19:37] 0 five view of cryo like that's not
[00:19:41] happening anyways um so what I just said
[00:19:45] was this notice that if you apply cryo
[00:19:48] on a support character swap to duuke and
[00:19:50] then trigger melt it will remove the cry
[00:19:52] or on enemies whereas if you apply Hydro
[00:19:54] with a support like s tro for example
[00:19:56] swap to duuke and then vaporize it
[00:19:58] imediately the hydro AA won't
[00:20:00] necessarily be consumed immediately
[00:20:02] allowing you to vaporize and then
[00:20:03] vaporize again effectively getting more
[00:20:05] reactions out of less yeah like that's
[00:20:08] kind of how I dumbed it down although
[00:20:09] with his burst you apply to you pyro so
[00:20:11] it's not really true like it's true but
[00:20:13] if you burst it's to you but if you
[00:20:14] burst and you don't normal attack on
[00:20:16] duuke you're a [ __ ] loser well okay
[00:20:17] you're not a loser but like just normal
[00:20:19] attack on duuke so anyways um yeah
[00:20:22] although this text should have been
[00:20:23] earlier why was the text so delayed it
[00:20:24] was supposed to be here oh I'm not
[00:20:26] re-exporting 42 minutes go [ __ ] yourself
[00:20:28] unless everything's offs scaled is
[00:20:30] everything offs
[00:20:31] scaled surely not right wait when does
[00:20:34] this text come up two broken supports
[00:20:37] and any team like this off that's fine
[00:20:42] okay oh yeah dude okay dude I I [ __ ]
[00:20:46] added a new part about uh burn burn
[00:20:49] what's it called burn Vape dude if you

[00:28:56] legit doesn't exist that's actually not
[00:28:58] my
[00:29:04] fault dude dude who plays arand I'm
[00:29:08] sorry I'm
[00:29:13] sorry Lee U what if it's Yen no no no it
[00:29:18] has to be oh shenan good guess never
[00:29:20] mind uh bad guess 1.0 uh it's
[00:29:24] Singo boom okay it's a sword though
[00:29:28] which means we know that it has to be
[00:29:32] precisely it has to be coincidence I
[00:29:35] think
[00:29:36] not cryo sword G she's not a sword you
[00:29:39] [ __ ] loser kaching is
[00:29:42] though wait I'm going to lose my streak
[00:29:44] of 55 wait a second wait a second chat
[00:29:47] one sec one sec this is a 55 streak wait
[00:29:49] a second it's either cryo Gio or
[00:29:55] anus Animo sword there's gan
[00:29:59] and there's no one else in 1.0 I think
[00:30:01] yeah sucros and [ __ ] okay Geo sword in
[00:30:04] 1.0 there's none cuz albo came out later
[00:30:06] which means it has to be a cryos sword
[00:30:08] cryos sword Kaa he's not he's from
[00:30:13] monat Chong Yun he's a
[00:30:17] claymore wait what the [ __ ] wait cryo
[00:30:21] sword is there another one five star
[00:30:24] maybe
[00:30:25] CH okay dude this is not a character I
[00:30:29] actually okay I'm glad I slowed it
[00:30:34] down I actually almost
[00:30:40] lost disrespected Chi-Chi does not have
[00:30:42] a vision she's physical no disrespect to
[00:30:45] Chi-Chi but she does not generate any
[00:30:48] Crow particles therefore you cannot call
[00:30:50] her a crow
[00:30:54] character okay fun fact Chichi has
[00:30:56] generated more Geo particles than cryo
[00:31:00] because there's a chance you play her
[00:31:01] with albo and you hit the thing and then
[00:31:03] the pillar generates a Geo off of her
[00:31:05] hit therefore she generated Gio but not
[00:31:07] cryo
[00:31:11] true okay
[00:31:13] anyways cooler than you what do you mean
[00:31:16] cooler than me literally no one's Cooler

[00:55:13] role right but I think she like [ __ ]
[00:55:15] that I'm not a mother and then decided
[00:55:16] to be a father because she's like oh I
[00:55:18] hate what mother's doing so I'm going to
[00:55:19] do it differently and I'm a father

[00:55:53] there it's okay
[00:55:58] linny's gonna fight her aware no but
[00:56:01] okay maybe but I know CU
[00:56:03] dude I don't know I'm not I'm not in
[00:56:06] deep enough for the lore but I feel like
[00:56:07] she probably wait is that just the
[00:56:10] yanching jinglu all over again cuz if it
[00:56:13] if it's just a cycle then yeah Linny and
[00:56:15] [ __ ] are going to have to fight her but
[00:56:17] I assume she's just like [ __ ] it I'm not
[00:56:19] mother I'm father and then it
[00:56:21] changes like I feel like she actually
[00:56:22] likes them like the old yeah exactly I
[00:56:25] feel like the old Nave didn't care about
[00:56:26] her children but I feel like like AR
[00:56:28] like you know kind of cares like they're
[00:56:30] probably still child soldiers that she's
[00:56:32] like you know
[00:56:35] but it's in the other
[00:56:39] trailer she's going to die oh no okay no
[00:56:43] no flame but someone needs to die it
[00:56:45] shouldn't be her but like not
[00:56:46] necessarily but dude we have like what
[00:56:48] 70 80 characters someone's got to die
[00:56:56] not saying it's her I'm just saying some
[00:56:59] characters Dory no one cares all good uh
[00:57:03] that was a really hype trailer I really
[00:57:06] enjoyed
[00:57:08] it I think we needed that it it put a

[01:22:31] principle what would you
[01:22:37] do the math is
[01:22:41] simple there's no way to define the
[01:22:43] value of a single
[01:22:49] CH but this music is kind of good but I
[01:22:53] believe
[01:22:54] a ship is worth a
[01:22:57] miracle the dice are
[01:23:01] cast it's all or nothing
[01:23:06] now this is humanity and its most
[01:23:09] primitive
[01:23:11] form but life would be quite dull if it

[02:15:37] way which way like this or like no like
[02:15:40] you guys can't
[02:15:43] see oh my flashlight whatever it's fine
[02:15:52] turn the lights on then you turn to
[02:15:56] sorry I don't want to get copyrighted uh
[02:15:58] this one does it go behind his flap or
[02:16:00] no it goes right in front of it so this
[02:16:02] is
[02:16:03] good this is
[02:16:05] good
[02:16:14] um it goes like that the arrow is
[02:16:17] pointing this way wait so that means
[02:16:19] it's the other way that means it goes
[02:16:20] like this this wait but it doesn't fit
[02:16:22] the hole that way so that's
[02:16:27] cap wait does this one fit the hole that
[02:16:30] way no it doesn't it would go like this
[02:16:33] but that one's not
[02:16:41] there okay so we're going to put
[02:16:44] this this one it goes It goes like this
[02:16:49] and then we put it in here
[02:16:51] so like
[02:16:53] this and then we put it
[02:16:55] here
[02:17:00] boom chat does this for this spear does
[02:17:03] this look like the
[02:17:06] box so the spear is here and the swirl
[02:17:08] is pointing towards his mask the swirl
[02:17:11] points towards his mask the
[02:17:19] swirl yeah it does
[02:17:22] oh you guys can't see
[02:17:26] this see the swirl is going that
[02:17:42] way fix
[02:17:44] it okay maybe I am Pega
[02:17:51] this other one goes
[02:17:53] here dude imagine I just took Shia out
[02:17:56] this would have been so
[02:17:57] easy it's pointing the wrong
[02:18:00] way mother
[02:18:13] Freer can I move my camera what if I put
[02:18:15] it like no that doesn't work what if I
[02:18:31] so okay so here we see that this one
[02:18:34] points towards his Jade spere it does
[02:18:38] like a diagonal towards the Jade
[02:18:40] sphere so this
[02:18:45] thing but it doesn't fit the hole like
[02:18:48] this
[02:19:04] wait does it ever go in like this
[02:19:06] thoughts thought on it going in like
[02:19:11] this no
[02:19:23] wait what if it's just this one all
[02:19:25] along what if the whole time I wasn't
[02:19:28] using the wrong one last time and it's
[02:19:29] actually just this one wait okay okay
[02:19:32] okay okay okay let me look let me
[02:19:43] look okay this one goes in the back for
[02:19:46] sure let me put the back one
[02:19:52] uh it's next to his arm so it goes like
[02:19:56] this okay I got the wait no I
[02:20:01] didn't man maybe I should have just
[02:20:03] taken Shia out why did I put Shia in
[02:20:06] first this one's like it's not that
[02:20:09] close no it's like
[02:20:11] here it's like in between the two is it
[02:20:15] in between his two
[02:20:17] skirts or is it all the way in the back
[02:20:27] okay if this is your first Z encounter
[02:20:30] I'm I'm sorry uh uh okay I think it's
[02:20:33] just in the back here I think I don't
[02:20:34] need to over complicate it it's probably
[02:20:36] just in the
[02:20:39] back what did Fang say shag okay and
[02:20:43] then this one goes in front but it goes
[02:20:45] right in front of his little flap thing
[02:20:49] but not too in front front and so the
[02:20:52] way you want to do that is you put it in
[02:20:54] like
[02:20:56] this
[02:20:59] [ __ ]
[02:21:01] um
[02:21:05] [ __ ] wait this
[02:21:08] fits wait I got it surely is this
[02:21:16] good
[02:21:17] no wait what
[02:21:22] oh no that's not it wait the swirl goes
[02:21:25] this
[02:21:30] way wait this [ __ ] does not fit now
[02:21:38] though wait is this the wrong one
[02:21:47] then oh my God
[02:21:54] it points
[02:21:56] outwards it points this
[02:22:07] way okay dude the Spheres are different
[02:22:10] I got a different sphere cuz look this
[02:22:12] one it points diagonal like that but
[02:22:15] neither of mine do cuz look this one if
[02:22:18] it points it points uh uh this way right
[02:22:20] right it's not the same it's not the
[02:22:22] same wait but maybe if I no this isn't
[02:22:24] the same one so then this one is the
[02:22:26] only way but if I put it like this then
[02:22:30] it does that even look the same I mean I
[02:22:33] guess kind
[02:22:46] of okay I'm actually stalling
[02:22:59] she's not answering is a YouTube video
[02:23:02] what is
[02:23:04] this wait tenha unboxed this I'm not
[02:23:07] even so sure if it went in firmly why am
[02:23:09] I having this problem with Apex stuff
[02:23:11] all the
[02:23:13] time I have to figure out how to put
[02:23:16] halfway but something that you're
[02:23:18] supposed to assemble together they had
[02:23:19] different sh first put down sh figure
[02:23:22] first it didn't even go halfway but this
[02:23:25] one
[02:23:26] is
[02:23:31] that's okay I'm just going to leave it
[02:23:33] hanging like this it shouldn't fall off
[02:23:36] and the one on the right is this one the
[02:23:39] one on the right is the one on the right
[02:23:42] is this one okay I got it it's this one
[02:23:45] on the right cool and then the the last
[02:23:49] left one so let me follow the is
[02:23:52] supposed to go to the left
[02:23:56] side yeah easy okay I'm just going to
[02:23:59] leave it hanging like this it shouldn't
[02:24:00] fall off and the one on the right is

[03:35:54] it okay business share your
[03:36:02] screen watch this watch us watch us this
[03:36:04] is going to be great all right all right
[03:36:06] so he starts off I didn't need those
[03:36:09] particles on him all right how long
[03:36:12] until he
[03:36:13] dies how long you guys think Penance is
[03:36:16] Du I'm betting he will die on the
[03:36:19] second the
[03:36:22] second I'm used to
[03:36:28] it B is strong here com
[03:36:32] [Applause]
[03:36:37] the don't want to look bad he's popping
[03:36:41] off I get it I get it don't want to look
[03:36:44] bad on camera
[03:36:50] out of my
[03:36:51] [Music]
[03:36:53] way I mean I got
[03:36:57] it I had to die for the content but I
[03:36:59] got it I had to die for the content but
[03:37:02] I got
[03:37:03] it thoughts can you do it without dying
[03:37:07] well yeah but I only swapped the sign
[03:37:08] out then just to e to finished it with
[03:37:09] sign would have been poetic but it was
[03:37:11] unlucky but it like I didn't have to
[03:37:12] swap
[03:37:13] them someone said carried by hyper
[03:37:19] Bloom overload with unless you mean to
[03:37:22] say that hyper Bloom is a bad
[03:37:25] reaction that needs a lot of investment
[03:37:27] no hyper Bloom is
[03:37:29] terrible okay we know this like we know
[03:37:32] this cuz we can't get em main stats
[03:37:35] realistically
[03:37:37] realistically it's like if you're like a
[03:37:39] whale streamer like yeah you're going to
[03:37:40] get [ __ ] uh the you want you want to
[03:37:44] know how you know what character is how
[03:37:46] a character is better is how fast they
[03:37:48] kill copia so how about you try
[03:37:51] switching the teams
[03:37:53] around
[03:37:55] true better than how does that watch
[03:37:59] this watch this L cook he just
[03:38:03] lamented okay yo that was just unlucky
[03:38:06] timing I mean the timing was very
[03:38:10] Telegraph no not if your eyes are closed
[03:38:13] low punch
[03:38:18] damn
[03:38:18] unlucky for
[03:38:22] E I [ __ ]
[03:38:25] expired did you even use it yeah at the
[03:38:27] start at the start oh okay cuz I forgot
[03:38:29] he had a shield I was about to rotate so
[03:38:31] I all you should you should you should
[03:38:34] swap the teams around and try sh first
[03:38:36] half so we can see who's better I'm not
[03:38:38] playing sh
[03:38:39] first dude sh 121 and two is so [ __ ]
[03:38:42] good and then 123 it's just yeah [ __ ]
[03:38:46] despair so
[03:38:50] bad that was good though Chad right that
[03:38:54] was actually surprising you only died
[03:38:56] when the enemy was low enough that you
[03:38:58] it it would die anyway it didn't matter
[03:39:01] I locked in play music okay I'll turn it
[03:39:04] down
[03:39:05] though like yeah sure you did die no but
[03:39:09] I didn't actually die that was content
[03:39:10] death you know
[03:39:11] [Music]
[03:39:15] were you supposed to finish him up with
[03:39:17] a Soo e because it's poetic yeah for
[03:39:22] Content how's he going to do that if he
[03:39:26] de okay I did Place overload Soo when
[03:39:29] Chevy first came out it was actually fun
[03:39:30] oh no it was not fun but
[03:39:32] like I was cooking dude honestly

[03:39:55] Co-op I mean C's always good what are
[03:39:57] you ya
[03:39:58] about true but he he he's goed with the
[03:40:01] sauce in Co-op true especially because
[03:40:03] you don't need to swap back and heat up
[03:40:05] every [ __ ] mid rotation why do you
[03:40:07] have so many fourar thingies I keep them
[03:40:09] for a rainy

[03:54:18] co-oping in 2024 dude I actually did
[03:54:21] some co-op with viewers like yesterday
[03:54:23] trying out like actual good co-op teams
[03:54:26] and it was kind of fun about some local
[03:54:29] Legends killed some ball some local
[03:54:32] Legends wait I'm
[03:54:36] down it was actually kind of fun
[03:54:44] you want to see my Co-op tier list
[03:54:47] actually I do not want to see your Co-op
[03:54:49] tier list you should you should look at
[03:54:51] it with
[03:54:56] [Music]
[03:54:59] chat let me down in the group
[03:55:02] chat do we want to
[03:55:06] fight wait you're asking
[03:55:09] [ __ ] let get everyone actually which yeah
[03:55:13] sure
[03:55:15] who are you asking what group CH I don't
[03:55:17] know either Fang one or Jake one is
[03:55:19] there one with both I don't think
[03:55:22] so oh there's one for valerant but
[03:55:24] you're not in it cuz you don't play Val
[03:55:26] damn that's [ __ ] up D that's [ __ ] up
[03:55:29] that is [ __ ] up wait is Jake give up I
[03:55:33] [ __ ] know
[03:55:34] actually
[03:55:40] probably here's a tier list you can look
[03:55:42] at it true
[03:55:49] evaluate it rank it play it dude I hate
[03:55:54] seeing doryan s
[03:55:56] ti so do
[03:55:59] I now to start reeling them
[03:56:03] in but he
[03:56:05] is Yo low key I think kokomi is a bit
[03:56:08] higher I think K's ass cuz she also does
[03:56:11] decent damage like I feel like a lot of
[03:56:13] the other you're healing Ki actually
[03:56:15] does does more damage but okay no well
[03:56:18] like yeah but no you have to be hyper
[03:56:22] blooming unironically like the the main
[03:56:25] reason why kokumi is there is because
[03:56:27] net is too good and you want to use net
[03:56:31] and you don't really want to use both so
[03:56:34] you'd rather your healer be another
[03:56:36] ele in Te are you care about high drop
[03:56:39] you'd rather have him and hon we're
[03:56:42] actually tcing
[03:56:47] yeah also her op is like kind of not
[03:56:50] that great and like her damage when
[03:56:54] her is not there anymore as I remember
[03:56:57] what it
[03:56:59] was wait so you're saying officials in

[03:57:29] [ __ ] are you do on Singo Auto
[03:57:31] attack yeah wait how is frem this
[03:57:36] High uh physical is actually pretty good
[03:57:38] in Co-op if you have like uh someone
[03:57:41] playing C6 M someone playing Razer and
[03:57:43] then two other physical carries why
[03:57:46] would you have that in
[03:57:49] Co-op okay cannot dude no one is like
[03:57:52] building their Co-op to go physical

[04:26:28] wrong you are wrong that's
[04:26:35] crazy you are his VA
[04:26:38] True yeah maybe they're just Z fans and
[04:26:41] and they they just just feel like he
[04:26:43] sounds like you so they they really want
[04:26:45] to want to hear him okay but have you
[04:26:48] heard like
[04:26:51] Pier okay okay what fatou harbers do you
[04:26:54] think are going to be
[04:26:55] playable or how many of them do you
[04:26:57] think I mean I don't I wait wait let me
[04:27:00] let me open the
[04:27:02] [ __ ] cuz we're talking about this now
[04:27:04] before there's any leaks or
[04:27:07] anything okay wait wait so cuz I think
[04:27:10] every single one they make playable is a
[04:27:12] of money for them for free I think I
[04:27:15] think will be playable I think the least
[04:27:17] likely to be playable is dor but I hope
[04:27:19] so no the least likely to be playable is
[04:27:25] uh blank is who his name the guy the one
[04:27:29] I like what's his name again oh the yeah
[04:27:31] I don't know uh the [ __ ] um Pinella
[04:27:35] yeah Pinella I think he's the least
[04:27:37] likely to be playable because cuz he's
[04:27:39] not like sex appeal yeah yeah but I I
[04:27:42] think he's cool I think he's
[04:27:46] like
[04:27:48] yeah I think every oh they'll all be
[04:27:51] playable except for him well the Tor is
[04:27:54] literally like the [ __ ] like gen
[04:27:57] equivalent of the [ __ ] Austrian
[04:27:58] painter but um they could either just
[04:28:02] say [ __ ] it evil characters playable
[04:28:04] kind of I mean AR likeo might be evil
[04:28:05] like we don't fully know and
[04:28:08] um [ __ ] what's his name uh dor might
[04:28:11] just like like I hope this doesn't
[04:28:12] happen but I think we talked about this
[04:28:14] he could just [ __ ] have a good clone
[04:28:16] wow I'm the nice one I killed the bad
