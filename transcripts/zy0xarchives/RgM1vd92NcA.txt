[00:28:05] chair Arnold I'm sorry so it's not like
[00:28:07] my posture okay it was pretty bad it did
[00:28:10] also make me look short
[00:28:17] fromion what is this was real when they
[00:28:21] was introduced into Dragon spine I
[00:28:24] remember my own chat oh yeah we have to
[00:28:25] fight the [ __ ] Bor ging that was so
[00:28:27] cringe we have to fight the Bor okay
[00:28:30] some of these some of the things we did
[00:28:31] in this event let me pull up the VOD
[00:28:33] where's the VOD where's the VOD where's
[00:28:34] the VOD where's the VOD how do I watch
[00:28:36] full watchful video okay the dude some
[00:28:38] of the things we did were cool some were
[00:28:40] so okay the Bor King was literally
[00:28:42] impossible to get hit like it was so
[00:28:45] easy that the only way you would win was
[00:28:47] by taking less sheer cold damage cuz no
[00:28:51] one would take damage and the last
[00:28:52] person to live would win so whoever left
[00:28:54] the [ __ ] bonfire last would win so
[00:28:57] the the only thing we could do is we
[00:28:59] used our ult to get ICD on the shear
[00:29:01] cold that's the only thing you could do
[00:29:03] and I ended up winning it but it was
[00:29:05] like it wasn't like skill it was Lally
[00:29:07] just you just can't get hit and then I
[00:29:11] sucked at the racing event but it's fine
[00:29:12] jakay carried that one if you're like oh
[00:29:14] oh so bad listen first of all I didn't
[00:29:16] even do bad okay I had to save a baby uh
[00:29:19] a puppy but I didn't even do bad okay I
[00:29:21] was just like slightly behind the only
[00:29:23] reason I did a bit worse is cuz they cut
[00:29:24] a corner that I didn't and second of all
[00:29:26] the first time okay for most of it I
[00:29:29] performed fine but the first time I used
[00:29:31] saou E I canceled it after 5 Seconds cuz
[00:29:33] I thought it was yolan like I held it
[00:29:34] for yolon duration then I canceled it
[00:29:36] with a dash cuz if I was yolon that
[00:29:38] would have been optimal but I was saw
[00:29:40] you so anyways but after that other than
[00:29:43] that it was fine like I actually did
[00:29:44] fine after that it just
[00:29:47] dude doesn't matter doesn't matter for
[00:29:50] the [ __ ] doesn't matter he I

[00:30:03] time I fought the midr I was bad cuz I
[00:30:04] didn't know that with the Geo Shield his
[00:30:06] thing goes back like he does like a and
[00:30:08] then it goes all three but as soon as I
[00:30:10] dodge it like twice I was fine and I was
[00:30:12] goated look look look look look look
[00:30:14] look my streamer okay this okay this is
[00:30:16] probably me skill issuing going to swi

[00:34:30] that's APAP boom APAP but here there was
[00:34:33] none so like you couldn't even see it so
[00:34:35] it was like we were guessing what it was
[00:34:37] I was like maybe I'm stupid and it's
[00:34:38] like another
[00:34:43] one for those asking about the 4.2

[00:34:56] okay it's in 8 and 1 half hours which
[00:34:58] means I'm streaming now then I'm I'm I'm
[00:35:01] like barely napping then I'm streaming
[00:35:03] again then topaz is out at 6 p.m. on na
[00:35:05] so then I'm streaming again it's going
[00:35:06] to be three streams in two
[00:35:08] days true I'm going to be like I'm going
[00:35:10] to have no sleep but hey we're back all
[00:35:13] right we're
[00:35:17] back I really wonder how one can play oh
[00:35:19] she out at 1 p.m. whatever but I'm going
[00:35:21] to stream a bit I'm going to stream a
[00:35:22] bit later I'll stream probably like 300
[00:35:24] p.m. for topaz I might be a little late
[00:35:26] okay I might be a little late on topaz
[00:35:28] but I will stream topaz I might be a
[00:35:30] little late but I will stream
[00:35:33] her uh outside of that I think that's
[00:35:37] mostly it uh I didn't even know I had an
[00:35:39] Instagram by the way I think Fang made
[00:35:41] one for me and I just forgot about it
[00:35:42] and then everyone tagged me it so I
[00:35:43] reinstalled it I'm not going to I mean
[00:35:45] yeah um also we didn't do the Wordle or
[00:35:49] the gendle so we're going to do that
[00:35:50] right now this they I don't know what
[00:35:51] the [ __ ] wait what is hard
[00:35:54] mode any hit wait should we do hard mode
[00:35:56] chat is that
[00:36:04] ass yes what's up bubbly
[00:36:10] vacuum I wonder how one can play a game
[00:36:12] for three years stream it for a living
[00:36:14] make probably the best guys about it
[00:36:15] okay remove the probably from that uh
[00:36:17] and and there are and still be so bad at
[00:36:19] it cheer
[00:36:21] 100 listen here you little
[00:36:24] rascal listen here bud
[00:36:27] I'm not bad at genin okay there's
[00:36:30] actually a perfect zff clip that
[00:36:32] explains this is Zio
[00:36:40] bad perfect the Jeff clip to explain
[00:36:42] this want to talk about this one
[00:36:45] unironically bad of the game where is he
[00:36:46] trolling for
[00:36:50] stream it's complicated the short answer
[00:36:53] is is it's a bit of both but he is
[00:36:55] unironically bad at this not on wrongly
[00:36:57] bad but listen to the next part I'm not
[00:36:59] but listen to the next part answer
[00:37:03] is the reason why he's bad at the game
[00:37:06] is because the game punishes you for
[00:37:08] being good at the game the game punishes
[00:37:12] you for being good at the game
[00:37:15] Shakespeare couldn't even have said it
[00:37:17] better so there's no reason to become
[00:37:20] better if you become better at genin all
[00:37:23] that happens is true you will be more
[00:37:26] reward when you do the only difficult
[00:37:28] true that's the reward for becoming
[00:37:32] better again if Shakespeare was alive at
[00:37:34] the same time as the Jeff Shakespeare
[00:37:36] will be working at McDonald's that's all
[00:37:37] I'm saying that's all I'm saying that's
[00:37:39] all I'm saying no problem with that it's
[00:37:40] a hard job I'm just saying he I'm just

[00:44:16] good this dude just out buddied
[00:44:20] Zio what the [ __ ] is
[00:44:23] this in the ging community
[00:44:27] what the actual this better not have a
[00:44:29] lot of
[00:44:36] views we all know the how does this have
[00:44:42] 3K all and charismatic ging streamer Z
[00:44:47] and he has been making videos for a very
[00:44:49] long time
[00:44:53] but what the [ __ ] are this yo no way you
[00:44:57] like um how do I say it this
[00:45:01] professor I'm going to pee on my
[00:45:03] keyboard in why is there a video essay
[00:45:05] about me
[00:45:07] okay
[00:45:08] okay let's watch can I watch I mean it's
[00:45:11] about me I can watch it right okay
[00:45:13] really go wrong with this man wait what
[00:45:16] do you mean go wrong what find out I I'm
[00:45:19] going to preemptively like the video and
[00:45:20] if it's bad I will remove my like which
[00:45:22] is basically it's akin to getting a a
[00:45:26] five sentence introduce to you the
[00:45:28] insanity system the more one derives
[00:45:31] from the societal Norm the more insane
[00:45:34] it can be considered is the philosophy
[00:45:37] of the derangement meter so if Z
[00:45:40] displays exemplary behavior he will get
[00:45:42] minus 50 points when he displays
[00:45:45] degenerated Behavior okay this is just
[00:45:47] going to be Clips out of context okay
[00:45:50] ever okay well 50 okay now playing genin
[00:45:54] is the first topic
[00:45:58] dude I literally exemplary behavior I
[00:46:00] make guys and I don't even encourage
[00:46:02] wailing okay most you can be playing
[00:46:05] this game oh I'm blocking my own face
[00:46:07] I'm going to go like are you guys going
[00:46:09] to lose track of which ZX is real may be
[00:46:11] seen as deranged at first it does not
[00:46:14] really derive from the societal norm and
[00:46:17] therefore I would argue that it doesn't
[00:46:20] add much to the derangement meter and so
[00:46:23] I will give it a questionable pastime
[00:46:25] plus 20 so playing genin not the best
[00:46:29] but still okay a okay now we are going
[00:46:33] to get into the real stuff he's which
[00:46:36] chat is real oh
[00:46:39] [ __ ] okay does this help is this scuffed
[00:46:47] example everyone knows that Z YouTube he
[00:46:50] seems pretty normal all right his guys
[00:46:53] are very great and he is always just
[00:46:57] really calm and collected in there but
[00:47:00] there are still some forboding signs
[00:47:03] however and the shiao videos and extreme
[00:47:06] attachment to Xiao are also what the
[00:47:09] [ __ ] is okay I'm I'm not okay okay okay
[00:47:11] okay
[00:47:12] listen what the okay listen first of all
[00:47:15] you can't call me corrupted two years
[00:47:17] ago when your YouTube says two jar
[00:47:24] gedon
[00:47:28] so seen on this channel and not only on
[00:47:31] his twitch so he will get a socially
[00:47:35] acceptable on this one on a minus 20 how
[00:47:39] 20 dude I make like 10 guides per
[00:47:42] unhinge video see Laura mechanic cardal
[00:47:45] has got a
[00:47:47] zero at this moment which means that SC
[00:47:50] is completely neutral at dud is E just
[00:47:54] that much better than us this guy guy
[00:47:56] he's not even his language of his
[00:47:57] YouTube wasn't French but he speaks F he
[00:47:59] just said a [ __ ] whole ass French
[00:48:00] sentence and then meanwhile in in the
[00:48:03] United States of a you go up they're
[00:48:05] like I only speak America not normal and
[00:48:08] not insane now we are going to get into
[00:48:11] the real that being his
[00:48:20] twitch he seems pretty normal that's
[00:48:23] what I would say if I watched sco three
[00:48:26] years
[00:48:26] ago has slowly descent into Insanity
[00:48:30] over the years did he just not say my
[00:48:32] name what was this as
[00:48:36] slowly okay maybe I don't know sent into
[00:48:39] in F that censor my name or was the
[00:48:42] editing software this means that SC will
[00:48:45] get a minus 20 for society societally
[00:48:48] acceptable and why not a minus 50 you
[00:48:52] could ask well it's because it's still a
[00:48:55] great
[00:48:56] 1500 bits I'm not is still a YouTuber SL
[00:48:59] streamer and I would say that it's still
[00:49:02] useful he's still doing something useful
[00:49:05] and he has some personal fulfillment and
[00:49:07] gain from it so minus 20 and not minus
[00:49:10] 50 wait what how okay first of all why
[00:49:13] is this guy's chart 0 to 50 to 100 if
[00:49:15] he's always giving minus 20 second of
[00:49:17] all I it is useful I showcase perfect
[00:49:20] rotations answer every chat message help
[00:49:23] guide players do account reviews U ID
[00:49:25] reviews and I never make any mistakes on
[00:49:27] stream so it's educational second of all
[00:49:30] this was not your first
[00:49:32] suggestion what have you been searching
[00:49:34] for this to come up this is not the
[00:49:36] first thing when I search it look I'll
[00:49:38] pull up YouTube right now is
[00:49:41] Zio okay why is okay but who the [ __ ]
[00:49:44] searches this okay wait how is that the
[00:49:46] okay wait actually
[00:49:51] though how is but we all know that
[00:49:54] Twitter is very sad but first we are
[00:49:58] going for
[00:50:01] artifacts AKA ver million artifacts are
[00:50:04] a rather difficult subject when it comes
[00:50:07] to Z because we all know that he has an
[00:50:10] extreme addiction to the it's not an
[00:50:13] addiction I've literally build it in
[00:50:15] golden trooping machine Nest 4 and I
[00:50:19] actually calculated the amount of resin
[00:50:21] SL time he spent on this domain so from
[00:50:25] the Vermilion fod strong Box video we
[00:50:29] know that Z had
[00:50:32] 486 F Vermilion pieces and Echo pieces
[00:50:36] so if we assume that every single
[00:50:39] artifacts run gives you well one
[00:50:42] artifacts for 20 res then we have that
[00:50:46] this all took
[00:50:48] 58.5 days which is not really much but
[00:50:52] that's because the calculations are not
[00:50:54] correct because not every single piece
[00:50:56] was fed in the strong box because a lot
[00:51:00] of them were just leveled and had some
[00:51:02] potentials uh not a lot of them I would
[00:51:04] argue but still some but with the genin
[00:51:09] impact third anniversary we discovered
[00:51:12] to our greatest uh can we stop the video
[00:51:15] disappointment can we stop the
[00:51:17] video that Z run the machine nest for
[00:51:23] 1,277 times this a year alone and we
[00:51:27] also know that sco crafts condensed
[00:51:29] resin so if we assume that you get 160
[00:51:32] resin each day then that means that with
[00:51:35] cond resin he can do four runs a day
[00:51:38] which means
[00:51:40] [Music]
[00:51:41] 31925 days farming this year shut the
[00:51:46] [ __ ] up so this means that Z literally
[00:51:50] farmed almost every single day in
[00:51:53] Vermilion this year here which is
[00:51:57] completely shut the [ __ ] up but in his
[00:51:59] defense that's not I'm going to try to
[00:52:02] defend him but it's not really possible
[00:52:04] because you can't defend deranged
[00:52:06] Behavior but um at least Z does spend
[00:52:10] some Primal gems to refill his resin so
[00:52:13] the calculation may not be 100% correct
[00:52:16] but true I I have to so that
[00:52:19] I I have to so I can be responsible in
[00:52:22] other ways 100% correct so
[00:52:26] 31925 days farmed but it doesn't end
[00:52:29] here do you know how many ruin graders
[00:52:31] I've killed so let's say that every
[00:52:33] takes 2 minutes please tell me he didn't
[00:52:35] that means including walking and
[00:52:37] claiming artifacts and um in Z's case
[00:52:40] filing out of the domain and having
[00:52:42] skill issues in general okay then that
[00:52:45] you can't say skill issues and then show
[00:52:47] the most ass cheeks Abyss ever this
[00:52:49] Abyss literally caused trauma therapists
[00:52:52] all throughout the world literally got
[00:52:54] more clients cuz of this [ __ ] Abyss
[00:52:57] with the two cryo [ __ ] and the
[00:52:58] one Hydro One that would freeze team you
[00:53:00] I'm not even kidding by the way falling
[00:53:02] out of the domain and having skill
[00:53:03] issues in general that was not skill
[00:53:05] issue then that means that SC has wasted
[00:53:07] also I wasn't using a shield I was
[00:53:08] playing a fourstar freeto playay
[00:53:10] friendly team and having skill issues in
[00:53:12] general then that means that sco has
[00:53:15] wasted
[00:53:17] 2,545 minutes in the domain and that's
[00:53:21] 42 why did Benn die 66 hours and does
[00:53:26] almost two days this year alone it goes
[00:53:31] without saying that this is an extrem my
[00:53:33] clears aren't 2 minutes my clears are
[00:53:35] not 2 minutes okay my clears are not 2
[00:53:38] minutes case of degeneracy and
[00:53:41] degenerated behavior Al this is only one
[00:53:44] year I did definitely two years of
[00:53:45] Vermilion considering that sco is
[00:53:47] grinding for a nonexisting upgrade for
[00:53:50] his artifacts what do you mean
[00:53:52] non-existing my show is literally top 50
[00:53:55] right now now in Z's defense I want to
[00:53:58] talk a bit about touching grass which is
[00:54:00] also a difficult subject in the gening
[00:54:03] community and I do not really want to go
[00:54:05] into private matters but it's generally
[00:54:08] known that the Mr Z himself has studies
[00:54:11] to attend to and studying is an example
[00:54:15] of exemplary behavior therefore gaining
[00:54:18] him
[00:54:19] minus dude [ __ ] you shut the listen
[00:54:24] twitch caps the bid rate it's nothing we
[00:54:27] can do my why do you think my genin
[00:54:29] videos look a bit better okay cuz I can
[00:54:31] record at like a million bit rate but
[00:54:33] when you stream it caps like 7K okay so
[00:54:36] it um 50 degeneracy points good for him
[00:54:41] maybe he's not degenerated at all is
[00:54:44] what I would say if I didn't look at his
[00:54:47] Twitter
[00:54:54] tter what are you going to pull up
[00:54:56] please please don't pull up my face X so
[00:55:00] the place truly the violist of
[00:55:03] reflection of the human mind can exist
[00:55:06] Zio thrives in this environment
[00:55:09] constantly shouting and sharing his
[00:55:11] unwanted opinions and thoughts why did
[00:55:14] he stop to scroll back up at hazo that
[00:55:16] says more about him than it does about
[00:55:17] me with the messes only truly deranged
[00:55:20] people would dare to follow him on this
[00:55:22] platform but since it's mostly for Cloud
[00:55:26] reasons he gets a plus 20 instead of a
[00:55:29] plus 50 on the derangement meter so plus
[00:55:33] 20 weird the conclusion is following the
[00:55:37] Judgment of the or mechan tal Cardinal
[00:55:40] the conclusion is that Z is declared not
[00:55:44] insane which is crazy to think about and
[00:55:49] maybe it's not crazy at all let me
[00:55:51] explain this reason for being so
[00:55:53] deranged on stream is simply for content
[00:55:56] and Views reasons so yes I have never
[00:56:01] made a mistake it was all a ploy
[00:56:03] actually every time I don't Dodge it is
[00:56:05] it is H manipulating you guys into
[00:56:09] thinking that it was it wasn't on
[00:56:13] purpose this stream is pre-recorded
[00:56:15] maybe he's normal just like the rest of
[00:56:18] us or maybe uh some of
[00:56:20] us wait uh sorry guys I just got a
[00:56:23] telephone call for my
[00:56:26] company yes I
[00:56:30] see ah yes I
[00:56:32] forgot I
[00:56:34] understand yes I will get to it right
[00:56:38] now so guys it's um it seems that I have
[00:56:42] uh forgot to go over one category that
[00:56:47] being I'll hate
[00:56:51] him okay listen
[00:56:56] [Music]
[00:57:05] he whips out his [ __ ] like literally
[00:57:07] just whips it out literally [ __ ] all
[00:57:10] okay by the way I said I said alam's alt
[00:57:13] is going to whip out his [ __ ] that
[00:57:14] literally is what happened with nevet
[00:57:16] nevet you hold his [ __ ] charge tack
[00:57:17] he whips it out by the way I predicted
[00:57:19] it just wrong wrong wrong character just
[00:57:22] whips it out literally [ __ ] all of you
[00:57:24] guys
[00:57:25] wait that actually doesn't sound too bad
[00:57:27] dude the things he could
[00:57:34] do wait that wasn't even
[00:57:37] [Music]
[00:57:39] bad that literally wasn't even
[00:57:49] bad glad we agree that I'm not
[00:57:53] insane X
[00:58:02] D and had some potentials for the
[00:58:05] record
[00:58:07] uh G
[00:58:10] gifa if you don't know how much resin I
[00:58:12] spent uh an easy way to uh check is if I
[00:58:15] show you my um my archive here uh and
[00:58:18] you understand that I don't really kill
[00:58:20] there aren't really many uh ruin graders
[00:58:23] in the outside world right so if I go to
[00:58:24] enemies and I scroll down and I go to
[00:58:26] the ruin grater
[00:58:29] um and you see that there's 2600 killed
[00:58:32] uh if we do a quick quick calculation
[00:58:35] just assuming that 2600 times let's say
[00:58:38] 40 resin CU condensed that is over
[00:58:40] 100,000 just by the way I know it's it's
[00:58:41] give or take it's a rough estimate uh uh
[00:58:43] uh but just know that you know
[00:58:50] um it's a lot of
[00:58:53] resin
[00:58:58] I wanted to make a video about me
[00:59:00] showing how much Vermillion I did I
[00:59:02] still should write that down Vermilion
[00:59:06] video but I think I'm going to wait till
[00:59:08] my trav's perfect like I need one more
[00:59:10] good piece I think I'll do that once I
[00:59:12] get uh either a flower or a feather cuz
[00:59:14] my sh right now look at this look at
[00:59:16] this flower or goblet so this is perfect
[00:59:18] this is like almost perfect this is
[00:59:20] really good all I need is either a good
[00:59:21] goblet like on set or a better flower my
[00:59:25] flower is decent
[00:59:26] but oh move your camera oh
[00:59:31] [ __ ] cool it yeah so feather is like
[00:59:34] perfect Sand's like perfect uh ciret is
[00:59:36] like per like really good and then
[00:59:38] goblet is good but it's offset so I
[00:59:39] could get a good onset goblet or a
[00:59:40] better flower my flower it's okay but it
[00:59:42] could be
[00:59:45] better so that's going to happen
[00:59:49] soon Society of zogs farmed emblem we're
[00:59:52] going to farm emblem we're going to do a
[00:59:53] strong Box video against slice I think

[01:47:25] probably finina resin right this quest
[01:47:28] line is amazing okay I'll I'm probably G
[01:47:30] to do it off stream I can't really
[01:47:31] stream World quest because there's no
[01:47:33] voice acting and I'm not going to read
[01:47:34] every
[01:47:35] [ __ ] every
[01:47:37] message I unless it's the I could voice
[01:47:40] act every
[01:47:49] arara
[01:47:51] aren't you a VA true actually good
[01:48:00] point how do you know what artifacts
[01:48:02] finina needs because she is the Hydro
[01:48:04] archon so there's a high chance that
[01:48:06] unless a new artifact set is released
[01:48:08] that she will want a artifact set from
[01:48:10] the new domain that is what happened
[01:48:12] with Ryden Shogun it is what happened
[01:48:15] with uh uh nahita and it is what is
[01:48:17] probably going to happen with finina
[01:48:20] with that in
[01:48:22] mind we are going to get the live stream
[01:48:25] where we get to see this uh literally in
[01:48:27] a few hours where we then can see what
[01:48:30] she will probably
[01:48:40] need oh my God Z not only
[01:48:45] [Music]
[01:48:47] dream imagine farming nymph's dream
[01:48:50] good overall that you deserve pce but
[01:48:53] now I really can see you're getting
[01:48:56] rewarded for once when
[01:49:04] every this set is cool it's a shame it
[01:49:06] doesn't have a four piece though but the
[01:49:08] two-piece is great it's good for nuu uh
[01:49:10] you could use it on like you know
[01:49:11] shielders but mostly nuu
[01:49:19] yeah
[01:49:30] happy 33 months hopefully 34 is when I
[01:49:34] end soon when does end trust also allo
[01:49:38] no three days we're chilling z
[01:49:40] x zero x heart that's the 33 months
[01:49:44] Peach
[01:49:49] damn
[01:49:55] it's a really long Quest wait should I
[01:49:58] off stream
[01:50:01] it minus 1,000 bits who donated 1,000 oh
[01:50:05] minus 1,000 I call this the year okay
[01:50:08] Chad what am I doing do I actually want
[01:50:10] okay what if Chad okay our month of
[01:50:12] resin for nevet video is going to be out
[01:50:14] in a few days I think also we could
[01:50:16] lowkey spend like 2 to 3K resin on
[01:50:19] finina Boom that's like a fast one but
[01:50:21] like oh how do you know what finina
[01:50:23] needs listen we're about to find out
[01:50:24] like probably tomorrow so we might as
[01:50:26] well just do this domain assume you can
[01:50:28] spend on her and then after while we
[01:50:30] edit I'll like keep the pieces that
[01:50:32] would be good for her cuz by the time
[01:50:33] this video is uploaded we'll know what's
[01:50:34] good for her does that make
[01:50:39] sense does that make sense the Damned
[01:50:42] will does again then lay a hand isn't it
[01:50:45] better to do after tomorrow yes we could
[01:50:47] also alternatively keep all of our resin
[01:50:49] for after tomorrow however we have
[01:50:53] 1,389 and I don't want to wait you might
[01:50:55] be like Z why do you have 1,389 resin
[01:50:59] simple my dear friend uh while I was at
[01:51:02] the twitchcon genton event there was a
[01:51:04] technical issue and then some amazing uh
[01:51:08] thoughtful individual said hey we feel
[01:51:10] really bad about this issue so we're
[01:51:11] going to give you 1300 resin true real
[01:51:18] story
[01:51:23] so we now have 1389 resin plus some
[01:51:26] refreshes plus five condensed plus some
[01:51:29] fragile resin I'll probably use like 10
[01:51:31] that's at least like two to three
[01:51:32] probably at least 3K
[01:51:36] resin and by the time this video gets
[01:51:39] edited we'll know what finina needs so
[01:51:41] I'll know what pieces I got that are
[01:51:42] good for
[01:51:44] finina and for now we can assume that
[01:51:46] she'll use her new set and listen this
[01:51:49] is going to be the most sus thing I say
[01:51:51] but she's Hydro so I'm just going to
[01:51:52] assume until proven otherwise that she
[01:51:54] wants HP I could be wrong I could be
[01:51:57] wrong but she's a hydro
[01:52:00] archon listen also you guys are going to
[01:52:03] type porn acting I literally had to I
[01:52:05] told Z Jeff personally like don't spoil
[01:52:08] her kit I don't want to know so I don't
[01:52:09] have to fake react when I see her kit so
[01:52:12] I've been purposefully trying to stay
[01:52:14] away from it okay like I've heard rumors
[01:52:17] but I've been purposefully trying not to
[01:52:19] look at leaks cuz we don't do that here
[01:52:20] and I want an authentic reaction not cap
[01:52:23] by the way not even capping reduced to
[01:52:26] just standing
[01:52:32] around are you testing finina no we we
[01:52:35] can't I I haven't I I don't know what
[01:52:37] the [ __ ] I don't even know what she
[01:52:38] looks like that's not true I know what
[01:52:39] she looks
[01:52:48] like
[01:52:58] so I think we uh you know we let's do a
[01:53:01] little bit of
[01:53:18] farming
[01:53:22] so you play on mut server I said that at
[01:53:23] the start of every guide but that's
[01:53:27] like the things that I can tell you are
[01:53:29] that I have access to it but it's
[01:53:31] literally like a day before the
[01:53:33] character's out for reference like I I
[01:53:36] don't talk about it much cuz I don't
[01:53:37] know what we're supposed to say or
[01:53:39] allowed to say but I'm allowed to say
[01:53:40] that it exists but it's literally like
[01:53:42] one day so like
[01:53:45] yeah that's
[01:53:48] all
[01:53:52] so but every time I guess something you
[01:53:54] guys type sus so I assume I'm right
[01:53:56] about her and if I am right about like
[01:53:58] if all the G every time I've said
[01:54:00] anything you just type sus as if I'm
[01:54:04] right but we don't we don't talk about
[01:54:05] at least
[01:54:06] here it's official that you hate Soo how
[01:54:10] do I hate Soo look at him look at him 93

[01:54:43] balls I don't know maybe there's some
[01:54:45] weird C6 Kazo attack that I don't know
[01:54:48] of but you're probably running him far
[01:54:50] as on Bennett
[01:54:58] right okay we actually have to do
[01:55:00] content now
[01:55:04] so I won't r rear and

[01:55:49] Channel and then after that I'm
[01:55:51] streaming again in the afternoon
[01:55:54] somewhere between 1: and 6:00 p.m.

[01:56:00] build her and play her and then that's

[01:56:02] would make a whole guide but I can't

[01:57:54] traveling so I missed the whole like
[01:57:56] rizzly reaction cuz I I wasn't home for
[01:57:59] a while I just think I think it should
[01:58:02] be illegal for rizzly to be released
[01:58:04] without a C1 being activated for
[01:58:05] everyone I think C1 should be part of
[01:58:07] his kit not the entire C1 but just the
[01:58:09] um at least the first part at least the
[01:58:11] like the um the first part you don't

[02:03:52] cool Bas your you can't base you can't
[02:03:55] tell me that it's correct cuz they say
[02:03:57] it like that in game they say
[02:04:04] tinari they also say new
[02:04:09] Vette bro is a guide maker and forgot G
[02:04:12] you exists for Shen has hold
[02:04:15] D
[02:04:17] dude who the [ __ ] is
[02:04:21] playing first of all oh a nice dendro
[02:04:24] goblet let's lock it second of all who
[02:04:26] is playing ganu freeze with Shena in the
[02:04:29] year
[02:04:31] 2023 almost
[02:04:35] 2024 also in that team often times
[02:04:38] you're burst and your e so your e has a
[02:04:40] lower cool down which means you can spam
[02:04:41] it more and uh uh uh your burst on
[02:04:43] freeze ganu is typically a big chunk of
[02:04:45] your damage because what you're doing is
[02:04:47] let's say you're venty
[02:04:49] what does he say and then he bursts
[02:04:51] sucks all the enemies up quadratic
[02:04:54] equation with your G's burst spawning
[02:04:57] icicles on all the enemies as your
[02:04:58] kakomi freezes them and then if you're
[02:05:00] using Shena on that team you can press
[02:05:02] your e uh initially to buff your burst
[02:05:05] damage and you do like one charge shot
[02:05:08] maybe more than one
[02:05:16] but Morana was never good okay you
[02:05:18] didn't play in [ __ ] 1.2 listen I I
[02:05:21] hate G's play style as much as the other
[02:05:23] person okay but I'm not going to deny
[02:05:25] the fact that when G first came out and
[02:05:27] all the enemies could get [ __ ] sucked
[02:05:28] and [ __ ] by ventti literally veny and
[02:05:31] ganu bursting together would just
[02:05:32] literally evaporate anything okay I'm
[02:05:35] not a g denier it was broken at the time
[02:05:37] it still is in certain situations where

[02:20:55] boom I mean it has ER entri C I mean
[02:20:58] okay never mind I'm sorry I'm sorry for
[02:21:00] skipping wa what was your blue Frosty
[02:21:03] thanks for three months haha did you
[02:21:05] know you can prime gaming with prime G
[02:21:07] you can sub for free each month whoa
[02:21:09] really that's
[02:21:11] awesome you can also get a a really cool
[02:21:14] glider let me show you with prime gaming
[02:21:17] with prime gaming you can get the unique
[02:21:20] well not anymore the the thing's over
[02:21:21] but there's a lot of new bundles and
[02:21:22] Deals and with prime gaming you could
[02:21:24] get uh you could have in the past get a
[02:21:25] glider that looks like this wow I love
[02:21:27] the
[02:21:33] gliders I just lost four
[02:21:35] bursts it's okay at least I got a prime
[02:21:37] sub out of it Tu uh the Assassin think a
[02:21:40] prime that was worth
[02:21:46] it husk Alo or golden tro Alo or you
[02:21:51] have no idea you think I would have no
[02:21:52] idea I'm a guide maker listen listen
[02:21:55] listen okay these were this was the math
[02:21:57] like as soon as it came out I haven't
[02:21:58] checked if the listen husk and golden
[02:22:00] troop are both good ALB you can go based
[02:22:02] on substats however if you already
[02:22:03] farmed a good husk I wouldn't recommend
[02:22:04] getting a new set but the do is
[02:22:06] efficient anyways and golden troop can
[02:22:07] be better when is golden troop better
[02:22:09] when you have a lot of Defense when do
[02:22:10] you have a lot of Defense with cinear
[02:22:11] spindle and Goro either one of the two
[02:22:14] but especially with both uh then golden
[02:22:16] troop can actually be better uh it's not
[02:22:18] like the biggest difference if you have
[02:22:19] good husk you're all good if you don't
[02:22:21] have cinear spindle again you can stay
[02:22:23] with husk they're pretty similar but
[02:22:25] especially if you're running gold uh uh
[02:22:26] husk uh me cinar spidle and Goro which
[02:22:29] is pretty common then golden troop will
[02:22:31] be better but both are
[02:22:33] good whereas if you're running no golden
[02:22:36] troop and no Goro then husk will be
[02:22:38] better for for for like the inverse is
[02:22:42] true time if you use ala without cinar
[02:22:45] you are coping dude not not everyone has
[02:22:47] an event from [ __ ] version 0.2 CBT 4
[02:22:51] okay it's fine you can use harbinger of
[02:22:54] dawn it is a good weapon uh and it's a
[02:22:56] three star just make sure you're above
[02:22:59] 70% HP or 90% not
[02:23:03] 70 do your Master's

[02:25:52] rotation it's for thrilling Tails like I

[02:25:59] charge attacks obviously sheno hold is
[02:26:01] going to be good but the if you're
[02:26:02] playing burn melt with with Shena it's
[02:26:05] kind

[02:29:04] G listen I'm not even slandering G
[02:29:07] you're putting words in my mouth when
[02:29:09] you could be putting something okay that
[02:29:10] would have been dis okay never mind
[02:29:12] let's just like stop talking for a
[02:29:13] little bit so no one can clip it okay
[02:29:16] listen you're putting words in my mouth
[02:29:17] I never sled G furthermore I think Linny
[02:29:20] has a more quick swappable style yeah
[02:29:22] you still want a charge tack but like
[02:29:24] first of all I've played G teams where
[02:29:26] it's literally like you have to e uh and
[02:29:29] then uh you you bet q and then as soon
[02:29:31] as the E explodes it applies cryo and
[02:29:33] then you have to swirl on Kazo and if
[02:29:34] you miss you get [ __ ] and so either
[02:29:36] you're playing freeze where you need
[02:29:37] veny and a vent you are not venting then
[02:29:39] you're coping or melt where you're
[02:29:40] either running a shield and then it's
[02:29:41] fine or not running a shield in which
[02:29:43] case you want to die in game but also
[02:29:46] out of game in game
[02:29:48] hypothetically but I think God is fine
[02:29:50] cuz will be good melt with a shield in
[02:29:52] my experience is decent however Linny is
[02:29:54] like I think his teams are more fun and
[02:29:56] you can group more with kazua and you
[02:29:58] can you can you can you can you can play
[02:29:59] more like quick swappy even if you don't
[02:30:01] need to you can like EQ if that just
[02:30:03] kills the
[02:30:08] enemies [ __ ] it I'm playing
[02:30:11] m okay let's all reach a consensus L can
[02:30:16] you Bur support I agree I think support
[02:30:18] G is actually
[02:30:23] based final warning final warning how
[02:30:27] good is that chat be
[02:30:31] honest why am I on stock
[02:30:33] sword
[02:30:34] winess are about to get busted let's
[02:30:39] keep going te let's keep going
[02:30:45] team let's let's keep going team that
[02:30:48] was
[02:30:53] worse I wish rizley could use rcent
[02:30:55] vener in this team and he was an emo
[02:30:58] this team would be
[02:31:00] lit should we play Scar
[02:31:09] here jeso oh it is actually literally
[02:31:15] jeso
[02:31:20] crit rate ER
[02:31:26] potential what is the best combo for
[02:31:28] rizzly with your C1 you can do a full
[02:31:30] normal attack string which is N5 and
[02:31:32] then charge attack without C1 just
[02:31:34] [ __ ] Mash your first Mouse button
[02:31:36] until your HP gets lower than charge
[02:31:45] attack
[02:31:47] the are about to get leave the wounded
[02:31:50] to
[02:31:51] me
[02:32:05] engaging does Barbara need em in a bloom
[02:32:09] team oh wait I thought you said Mel okay
[02:32:10] I thought about Vape okay okay yes yes
[02:32:13] you're playing newu Bloom uh I you're
[02:32:16] trolling you're playing Neu Bloom you go
[02:32:18] full em on
[02:32:21] Barbara Barbara is the same in that team
[02:32:23] use Barbara uh the same way you would
[02:32:25] use
[02:32:33] kakomi can you please play be I love him
[02:32:36] and we play
[02:32:39] B does Pila work in a freeze rizzly team
[02:32:42] yeah she reduces the defense of anyon
[02:32:44] it's pretty she has pretty good AOE
[02:32:45] compared to silver wolf uh good defense
[02:32:48] shad and is very freet to- play friendly
[02:32:49] uh also uh cryo res Shad so whether E2
[02:32:52] or E4 I forget I think it's E2 so yeah
[02:32:54] you can definitely use uh pail with
[02:32:56] rizzly we'll play BYU but uh not with
[02:32:59] rizzly we'll play
[02:33:00] net there you
[02:33:05] go all right let's head
[02:33:15] off
[02:33:29] me I
[02:33:32] just that's
[02:33:35] cool seems like an
[02:33:39] emergency allows for enough time for the
[02:33:42] attack buff to stay even after Benny q
[02:33:44] and Kaz know literally only 10 people in
[02:33:47] chat care about this right now so there
[02:33:49] is no reason for me to go over this
[02:33:53] however why is your
[02:33:56] okay okay you're telling me your team
[02:33:59] comp is okay you're tell okay you're
[02:34:01] telling me your team
[02:34:08] call you're replacing Shang Ling with
[02:34:10] chanha I mean you're saying C's gone you
[02:34:12] if your C's gone you do whatever you
[02:34:14] want nothing I say applies to you but
[02:34:15] for normal G why are you benching Shang
[02:34:18] Ling also you don't have a shield in
[02:34:19] that
[02:34:22] team this is what a rotation looks like
[02:34:25] if you have no Shield this is an example
[02:34:28] of a no Shield G
[02:34:31] rotation wait this one has a shield
[02:34:33] where the [ __ ] is
[02:34:35] it because yeah C gone you can quick
[02:34:37] scope also C6 shha is cracked so if
[02:34:40] you're C6 don't talk about it like don't
[02:34:41] worry you're cool don't worry
[02:34:45] Deen timer from starting
[02:34:47] effectively because a lot of people are
[02:34:49] playing these teams incorrect running of
[02:34:52] that here is some advice first of all
[02:34:53] for a melt G while I'll go into more
[02:34:55] detailed plier if you're running guu
[02:34:56] with Shang Ling it's pretty
[02:34:58] straightforward in the sense that you're
[02:34:59] going to first then use to know though
[02:35:01] is that in this team you
[02:35:02] want to expire then swapping your shling
[02:35:06] and catching the energy is pretty simple
[02:35:08] apply
[02:35:09] to with G can be okay against a lot of
[02:35:12] enemies where this team can get more
[02:35:14] complicated is if you're running Kazo
[02:35:15] with G you also imagine you're not
[02:35:17] running strong Le here you have no
[02:35:18] Shield you're getting [ __ ] ass
[02:35:20] blasted anytime an enemy looks at you
[02:35:22] because you want to be able to swirl
[02:35:24] cryo that's kind of the point of Kaza
[02:35:26] swirling cryo to buff your G's damage
[02:35:28] with the Verdes and vener set but also
[02:35:30] Infuse your kaz's burst with pyro as
[02:35:32] that is what's going to allow your G to
[02:35:33] melt constantly wow how do I do both
[02:35:35] surely it's easy ways to do this and you
[02:35:37] can find your own rotation the one that
[02:35:38] I have tested extensively and found to
[02:35:40] work is as follows starting by using G's
[02:35:42] skill and then a Char shot swapping to
[02:35:44] Bennett using his burst and then then
[02:35:46] going to kazwa using kaz's skill and and
[02:35:48] then his burst I use my Kaza skill just
[02:35:50] to get particles here but then the burst
[02:35:52] is what swirls cryo and also infuses
[02:35:54] pyro in case you didn't notice what
[02:35:56] happened to that clip was G's Blossom
[02:35:57] her Elemental skill the flower exploded
[02:36:00] W my dude if this flower misses by the
[02:36:03] way or or like an enemy cuz they can
[02:36:05] like yeah it taunts but if it misses if
[02:36:07] the enemy moves if you're doing a second
[02:36:08] rotation and the enemy has whatever
[02:36:10] [ __ ] uh Aura on them if what you
[02:36:13] literally hate your life what was using
[02:36:14] his burst if that missed you don't SW
[02:36:16] cryo if that [ __ ]
[02:36:19] thing what made him SW you get the cry
[02:36:22] there because it exp got infused with
[02:36:24] pyro because he was inside of Bennett's
[02:36:25] first that applies you get it while
[02:36:29] unless I SK usually I bet the Cs where I
[02:36:31] use for like I at like most background
[02:36:33] Clips I don't care but when I was like
[02:36:34] throwing a rotation usually I watch it a
[02:36:36] few times sometimes I still [ __ ] up
[02:36:39] but while my burst here infuses with
[02:36:42] pyro cuz Coo's pyro World infused but
[02:36:45] here he gets app cry at the last second
[02:36:47] boom so cry and then it infuses with
[02:36:54] pyro his burst got infused with pyro
[02:36:56] because he was inside
[02:36:58] anyways the more you
[02:37:03] know wait what the [ __ ] what am I
[02:37:05] playing oh never
[02:37:11] lete please me out dude what am I doing

[02:48:54] but is Fel actually good for hyper Bloom
[02:48:57] okay so on her own FAL is so broken that
[02:48:59] you can usually play her on any team in
[02:49:00] hyper Bloom typically because Oz doesn't
[02:49:02] really Target the cores and you're also
[02:49:04] building like crit and stuff like you
[02:49:07] wouldn't use her as a solo Electro like
[02:49:09] as your only hyper blooming character
[02:49:10] out over someone like kie however that
[02:49:13] isn't true if you can run her with an
[02:49:15] anemo character like sucrose who will be
[02:49:17] swirling the Electro from FAL so making
[02:49:20] FAL just a really strong like sort of
[02:49:22] all field carry support all field while
[02:49:25] your ano character like sucros in
[02:49:27] particular swirls that Electro hits all
[02:49:29] the [ __ ] cores and Hyper blooms and
[02:49:31] your sug is going to be building full em
[02:49:33] and going to be swirling your Electro
[02:49:34] and also your
[02:49:36] hydro so um yes H I explained it a bit
[02:49:40] in my official guide I trimmed it like
[02:49:42] this is another thing where like I talk
[02:49:44] for so long my guys that like I have to
[02:49:46] trim a lot and like I was talking to my
[02:49:48] editor like like Allan about this uh gig
[02:49:51] chat Allan how do I get to my channel
[02:49:52] they change the [ __ ] YouTube overlay
[02:49:54] but I was talking about it how like in
[02:49:56] the initial time I made this video I
[02:49:58] talked about hyper bling ficial like
[02:50:00] here and then I talked about it again in
[02:50:01] the teams I know I trimmed one of the
[02:50:03] two so I don't know what you guys ended
[02:50:04] up seeing is it still here I think I
[02:50:07] kept like a sentence here but basically
[02:50:09] team that
[02:50:10] wants it's like I want to say f is the
[02:50:12] best electro in like every team except
[02:50:14] hyper Bloom but she's also really good
[02:50:16] in hyper Bloom if you play sucros
[02:50:17] whereas if you don't don't play like if
[02:50:19] you're not running another hyper BL
[02:50:20] character don't use her there but if you
[02:50:22] are then she's really good even if you
[02:50:24] aren't it's like technically okay like
[02:50:26] you could do like yeah like there's
[02:50:29] there's a lot even like burgeon you
[02:50:30] could just have fishal on the side I see
[02:50:32] the value in my own world or as a second
[02:50:34] Electro or with sucros like there's
[02:50:36] really a lot you can
[02:50:39] [Music]
[02:50:42] do but you can't guess her alt I on [ __ ]
[02:50:49] you usually for a second Electro I use
[02:50:51] bet cuz I'm a bet uh enyer I love bet
[02:50:54] and she doesn't steal any of your cores
[02:50:56] but yeah official is also just
[02:51:02] official try the new event it's combat
[02:51:04] dude I saw the new event apparently it's
[02:51:06] kind of hard like relatively at the max
[02:51:08] difficulty and I wanted to make like a
[02:51:10] challenge video out of it like how like
[02:51:12] the C6 jzo one or I guess and um the
[02:51:16] shot one the only problem
[02:51:20] is the only problem is I don't want to
[02:51:22] pull like I don't want to
[02:51:24] wish it's not hard okay but like if I
[02:51:27] randomize the stuff it probably would be
[02:51:29] I just don't want to wish on the current
[02:51:30] like I already have rizle C1 and his
[02:51:32] weapon so I don't want to um
[02:51:36] wish so I think if the avenging finina
[02:51:39] Banner is good I might but we'll
[02:51:43] see ooh
[02:51:45] dude shut the [ __ ] up man sorry I'll
[02:51:48] stop oh not
[02:51:52] bad wait are these the same are dude
[02:51:55] these look the same what the hell I mean
[02:51:57] they're both not bad there a lot of
[02:51:59] stats could be good the
[02:52:04] F wish on Star rail
[02:52:13] instead do you know Doro if you do what
[02:52:15] do you think about him no I've never
[02:52:17] heard of him isn't that the thing that
[02:52:19] you like is like like a
[02:52:21] door midnight fantas no I met him he was
[02:52:24] really nice he gives he gives that
[02:52:26] energy not in a mean way like like in a
[02:52:28] in a Wholesome Way win but I think
[02:52:30] that's what he's going for so it's not
[02:52:32] like a bad thing a bitter pill to
[02:52:34] swallow taking a turn for the better bow
[02:52:37] your
[02:52:43] head
[02:52:45] H Into The
[02:52:49] Wind that guy is's actually tall though
[02:52:52] like I'm like six I'm like 68 he's like
[02:52:55] I'm 66 he's like probably like 6
[02:52:59] 68 pretty
[02:53:01] crazy o power damage I don't know who
[02:53:04] could use this but Power damage Sans
[02:53:11] unlucky oh SE get are pretty chill yeah
[02:53:17] for the most
[02:53:19] part for the most part I mean I'm also
[02:53:22] not like I don't
[02:53:25] know yeah I I'm very I'm like there's
[02:53:29] some people that are really close to and
[02:53:30] then others like I'm pretty like surface
[02:53:33] level cool with people like I don't need
[02:53:35] to I don't
[02:53:38] know I don't like to be involved in [ __ ]
[02:53:40] so I kind of just I'm kind of just there
[02:53:43] smiling
[02:53:52] socially awkward no listen that's not
[02:53:55] what I'm saying I'm saying if anything
[02:53:58] it's I don't want there is okay there's
[02:54:02] this thing where a lot of people have a
[02:54:05] lot of like drama with a lot of other
[02:54:07] people and I don't really care for that
[02:54:09] so I try not to get involved and I'm
[02:54:10] just like like if it's like my close
[02:54:12] friend like if it's people that I really
[02:54:14] care care about then I take sides but
[02:54:16] outside of that I'm not here being like
[02:54:17] Oh one person you know said this about
[02:54:19] me like I don't I'm not really like that
[02:54:23] I don't think it's worth like I am cool
[02:54:24] with everyone is what I try to like
[02:54:26] obviously there's exceptions like people
[02:54:27] that are [ __ ] or that [ __ ] like
[02:54:29] wrong my friends like I know there's
[02:54:32] some people that hurt zff a lot or that
[02:54:34] made him sad or that said bad things
[02:54:35] about him to those people I try like I'm
[02:54:38] not going to be an [ __ ] but you know
[02:54:40] I have my reasons to be like have a
[02:54:42] certain distance towards but outside of
[02:54:47] that I'm pretty just you know whatever
[02:54:49] and then there's people that I hold
[02:54:50] closer that I care more about remember
[02:54:56] help which is like the smaller
[02:55:00] Circle but like the Gena all the G
[02:55:02] creers like I've hung out with have been
[02:55:03] pretty cool so like dish is super
[02:55:07] wholesome uh and like I met Bop for the
[02:55:10] first time he was really nice and SL
[02:55:12] like they're both cool
[02:55:14] even fob what's wrong with fob he's
[02:55:17] short but that's not a
[02:55:22] crime oo that could be good oh NOP not
[02:55:31] good Drake's a really good company too I
[02:55:33] like
[02:55:37] Drake learn some fit lessons from B oh
[02:55:40] true dude bab has the best drip I told
[02:55:43] him I okay I look I have no problem
[02:55:47] complimenting listen my masculinity
[02:55:49] isn't too frail to where I can't
[02:55:51] compliment other men the Argent
[02:55:52] cosplayer his name is Mel I was like
[02:55:54] dude I have to admit your skin is
[02:55:57] beautiful and it was I told I told Bob
[02:56:00] his drip was impeccable he has good drip
[02:56:03] I I can't lie if you guys meet Bob they
[02:56:05] like God damn he has good
[02:56:13] drip
[02:56:15] by
[02:56:20] Royal a bit to swallow kind of creepy no
[02:56:25] it's not guys get complimented once
[02:56:27] every six years so when you say one it
[02:56:29] it's like oh [ __ ] and they'll probably
[02:56:31] remember it and it's it's good so be
[02:56:32] nicer to people there's nothing wrong to
[02:56:34] be like wow you take care of yourself
[02:56:36] your skin is is is is is don't say in a
[02:56:38] weird way but you have nice skin or it's
[02:56:41] very H uh what's the word like clear
[02:56:43] clean I don't know whatever the the word
[02:56:44] it is oh no that sucks unlucky clear I
[02:56:48] think clear is the
[02:56:51] word my skin sucks cuz I have to [ __ ]
[02:56:53] shave every day or I grow a beard which
[02:56:55] is fine but like I have to shave every
[02:56:57] day and I also get like P sometimes I
[02:56:59] get like a pimple and then if I shave it
[02:57:01] hurts and it bleeds and it's terrible
[02:57:03] and all my family has like gigachad
[02:57:05] Middle Eastern beards and I don't and I
[02:57:07] probably could grow it but there would
[02:57:09] be an awkward middle phase and I can't
[02:57:11] do that on stream because if I'm in the
[02:57:12] middle phase for a week for a month you
[02:57:14] guys are going to bully me and make fun
[02:57:15] of
[02:57:23] me become a vtuber while you grow your
[02:57:26] beard good idea actually while I'm
[02:57:28] growing my beard cam off I'll be a duck
[02:57:38] [Music]
[02:57:43] again haven't you always been in the
[02:57:45] awkward middle phase we have a comedian
[02:57:47] in
[02:57:49] chat face reveal like
[02:57:53] dream
[02:57:57] lament I wear a mask for hours at a
[02:58:00] time
[02:58:04] lament guys get complimented rely if
[02:58:07] someone what if I get Shia's shoulder t
[02:58:09] Shia's mask tattooed on my shoulder [ __ ]
[02:58:13] it Lament
[02:58:17] bow your head
[02:58:20] Sanctified kind of a c double you but I
[02:58:22] unironically would do it for a sub goal
[02:58:42] dum
[02:58:46] Electro bad Subs unluck damn
[02:58:50] unlucky get the Sha sleeve no I don't
[02:58:53] think I can pull it
[02:58:58] off so it doesn't make sense for me to
[02:59:00] get it I'm not going to like copy a
[02:59:02] video game character's sleeve that' be
[02:59:12] weird
[02:59:19] you already copied his
[02:59:21] height I'm going to get it okay I don't
[02:59:23] think it's weird to get it I just don't
[02:59:25] think one I don't think I'd pull it off
[02:59:27] two it probably has some like
[02:59:29] significance that I don't know
[02:59:31] of like mask would make more if I get
[02:59:34] the mask would make more sense but I
[02:59:36] don't think I'll get the
[02:59:37] whole one I might get a like I would
[02:59:41] might get a sleeve at some point
[02:59:43] eventually usually but I need to be a
[02:59:44] little more buff for

[03:07:52] brother D I literally don't look like
[03:07:54] him I'm laughing out of pity side
[03:07:56] effects
[03:08:00] remember [ __ ] I canel it I hit my
[03:08:04] okay I don't know how I canceled
[03:08:10] it as you wish
[03:08:36] um this could be
[03:08:37] good this could also technically be good
[03:08:41] but no I mean might be worth
[03:08:46] leving tips for my midterm exam get out
[03:08:50] of the stream that's that let that be
[03:08:52] the [ __ ] let that be a
[03:08:57] tip must me Twitch G
[03:09:05] yeah a bit P swamp seems like an
[03:09:11] emergency
[03:09:15] dude I saw someone talk okay I was like
[03:09:17] complaining about how like rizzly C1 is
[03:09:20] like or rizy C1 should be part of his
[03:09:22] kid and how it's annoying that it's not
[03:09:23] and people have replied like yeah it's a
[03:09:25] trend that all Fontan characters need
[03:09:27] their C1 bro who is saying Linny needs a
[03:09:30] C1 also neet C1 is really good but he
[03:09:33] doesn't [ __ ] need it he doesn't need
[03:09:36] it the hell why do people think he needs
[03:09:40] it like it's good but it's not like
[03:09:43] you're getting interrupted all the time
[03:09:45] cuz you can just kite or run a
[03:09:59] shield Ry doesn't need a C1 either
[03:10:01] listen here bucko there's a very big
[03:10:04] difference
[03:10:05] between this C1 giving a stack of the
[03:10:08] passive and Interruption resistance and
[03:10:11] a C1 why was it raining and a C1 that
[03:10:14] literally
[03:10:16] says you can now use your charge
[03:10:19] attacks it's like literally a part of
[03:10:21] his kit that you like rarely like it's
[03:10:24] like a central defining part of his kit
[03:10:27] that you otherwise can like sometimes
[03:10:34] use like neety one is really good I
[03:10:37] recommend getting it it's a good upgrade
[03:10:39] but
[03:10:40] like yeah it's different than rli's
[03:10:44] rizzly is more
[03:10:45] like changes his entire gam
[03:10:48] play Justice is blindsiding changes his
[03:10:51] passive no net all it does for his
[03:10:53] passive is it gives him another stack
[03:10:54] which it's a free stack so in a lot of
[03:10:56] his teams like I like in a lot of his
[03:10:59] teams you're otherwise only going to
[03:11:01] stack two times now you get a three it's
[03:11:03] easy easy peasy on top of the
[03:11:04] interruption resistance so it's usually
[03:11:06] more damage in some teams you already
[03:11:08] don't need the third stack maybe you're
[03:11:10] running like [ __ ] DEA Nita and like
[03:11:12] Fishel like whatever the [ __ ] right
[03:11:16] um Jong Le kazua
[03:11:20] right um then you don't need it as much
[03:11:24] but there's also a chance that like you
[03:11:26] either aren't getting three stocks or
[03:11:28] aren't running like your team comp can't
[03:11:30] get three stacks or maybe a future
[03:11:32] character you know what if finina works
[03:11:34] with him then you get hydro resonance
[03:11:36] which would be good cuz you get uh like
[03:11:38] a bunch 25% HP for him Hydro resonance
[03:11:40] that's nice but but then you lose out on
[03:11:43] a stack of your passive so your C1 would
[03:11:44] give you a lot of
[03:11:45] damage healing bonus
[03:11:57] physical like I'm not saying okay I am
[03:11:59] not for for like to clarify I'm not
[03:12:01] saying net um [ __ ] I'm not saying rizle
[03:12:04] needs his C1 it's just
[03:12:06] like it feels like a part of his kit is
[03:12:10] like I don't know it's not like he needs
[03:12:13] it it's just like I feel like he should
[03:12:15] have it by default cuz it changes his
[03:12:16] gameplay a
[03:12:17] lot and I feel like rizzly like your
[03:12:21] head a big part of his kit is his charge
[03:12:25] attacks it's just when you okay how do I
[03:12:28] expl okay let me explain it this
[03:12:30] way you're in an awkward position at c0
[03:12:33] where you ideally don't want to run a
[03:12:35] Healer and stay 50 to 60% HP so that you
[03:12:38] can get your normal attack buff and also
[03:12:41] get your unique Char attack which is a
[03:12:42] big part of your kit that's literally
[03:12:44] like an entire passive right however if
[03:12:47] you don't run a Healer you can't do this
[03:12:49] your HP negative or your HP neutral at
[03:12:51] best if you change your rotation but
[03:12:52] then you get hit once and it's [ __ ] or
[03:12:55] you run a Healer and then you can never
[03:12:56] charge attack well you can usually not
[03:12:58] charge attack cuz you're
[03:13:00] overhealing and then you just charge ATT
[03:13:02] whenever you're low so it's like weird
[03:13:04] but then C1 fixes
[03:13:11] that
[03:13:14] oh double
[03:13:17] crit whoa crit rate why am I can I be
[03:13:20] normal yeah crit rate double crit this
[03:13:22] could be good I'm going to lock them POG
[03:13:34] POG you don't need it why do you pull
[03:13:36] for it then uh it could make it I mean
[03:13:39] could be more fun more
[03:13:41] damage better game play like you don't
[03:13:44] you never need a constellation I don't I
[03:13:46] don't want people to go into a Goa game
[03:13:48] thinking they need to spend money right
[03:13:49] that's why I'm very careful with these
[03:13:51] things so it's not like you need it but
[03:13:53] it's definitely nice like it's one of
[03:13:55] the better consty ones it's one of them
[03:14:03] yeah
[03:14:09] yeah thew taught me I need to C6 r
[03:14:12] everything
[03:14:22] Dam how does it compare to hutan let me
[03:14:25] give you the Perfect Analogy as I pep aw
[03:14:28] refresh okay let me give you the Perfect
[03:14:30] Analogy Hut C1 is like you have a house
[03:14:34] and like Hut is a house you get the
[03:14:36] house wow this house is cool you get her
[03:14:38] C1 you move into a slightly bigger house
[03:14:41] okay it's better it's nice ER it's more
[03:14:43] convenient you no longer need a shield
[03:14:45] as much you don't have to jump cancel
[03:14:47] you can Dash cancel more damage it's
[03:14:49] nice I would upgrade to the house if I
[03:14:51] could but the first house is still comfy
[03:14:53] and affordable and nice rizle is like
[03:14:56] you have a really huge mansion but at c0
[03:14:59] you're confined into living in only one
[03:15:02] room one bedroom a toil half a toilet
[03:15:05] that's it once you get a C1 you unlock
[03:15:07] the door to the rest of the Mansion so
[03:15:09] at the end of the day both c1s take you
[03:15:11] into a mansion but with Hut zero you
[03:15:13] still had a nice house with rizzly the
[03:15:16] house is fine it's functional he's still
[03:15:17] a decent unit don't worry I like him but
[03:15:20] it's like there's so much potential
[03:15:22] that's just locked behind a [ __ ] key
[03:15:24] okay it's like oh I I have the charge
[03:15:26] tack I I can I can access the toilet no
[03:15:28] you can't there's nothing okay you
[03:15:30] barely have hand soap wake
[03:15:39] up who wait who's house get AC with C1
[03:15:43] R's house gets the doors put on C1 true
[03:15:48] no but you still have like a door or two
[03:15:50] like okay rly c0 some of the doors work
[03:15:53] some of the doors lead to like nothing
[03:15:56] like you try to open it it's
[03:16:09] locked so rith Le is basically a house
[03:16:12] that I can be inside of
[03:16:16] what oh [ __ ] I also need talent books
[03:16:19] and I also need the weapon mats is it
[03:16:20] today okay it's
[03:16:26] not can you put this in valerant terms
[03:16:29] okay I got you I got
[03:16:31] you I got you hear me
[03:16:34] out okay no I
[03:16:40] can't okay imagine you're lurking mid
[03:16:42] right imagine you're
[03:16:49] okay okay this kind of
[03:16:56] hard Okay C rle is like Chambers Sheriff
[03:16:59] like it's pretty good you're still you
[03:17:00] can still [ __ ] One Tap people but
[03:17:02] then all right it's like fine but then
[03:17:05] C1 you get the op and then it's like oh
[03:17:08] [ __ ] I just unlocked so much
[03:17:11] more
[03:17:12] and he's French silence the

[03:42:57] let's level
[03:43:06] it okay could I
[03:43:08] mean
[03:43:13] could it's it could still be good if it
[03:43:16] only rolls crit damage if it only rolls
[03:43:19] crit damage it's not bad not coping not
[03:43:22] joking if it if it only oh voice crack
[03:43:27] whoa hello test does mic
[03:43:30] work I'll just shut up I'm just going to

[03:43:59] okay next pieces let's start with Mar
[03:44:00] let me filter by Mar CH so I don't have
[03:44:02] to keep scrolling up oh my God look at
[03:44:04] how many artifacts we have 341
[03:44:08] 294
[03:44:10] a lot
[03:44:14] artifacts uh this could be good it only
[03:44:16] R crit
[03:44:24] damage yeah if we roll only ER then I
[03:44:27] need to pull for C2 so uh rizley needs
[03:44:30] ER oh that's a big roll that's a fat
[03:44:33] roll one more can you imagine only crit
[03:44:36] damage on the set cuz this set gives
[03:44:37] crit rate so you get a bunch of crit
[03:44:38] damage good for Lenny good for nevet
[03:44:40] good for rizzly especially Lenny cuz he
[03:44:43] has a crit
[03:44:47] Ascension wait a second what is
[03:44:50] happening please don't
[03:44:54] stop someone think eight months hope
[03:44:57] you'll have a nice god tier artifact
[03:44:59] hope please share your luck though if
[03:45:02] you manag to pull it off long don't
[03:45:04] drink it
[03:45:07] please what wait wait wait wait don't
[03:45:10] Jon don't count your eggs before they
[03:45:14] hatch in life you have to be patient
[03:45:18] before reaping the seeds that you
[03:45:21] sewed sewing the seeds that you you know
[03:45:24] what I
[03:45:25] mean not bad not bad not bad not bad not
[03:45:29] bad not bad hey hey hey not bad is an ER
[03:45:33] roll one more crit damage roll has like
[03:45:36] 30 something with ER it would be amazing
[03:45:38] one more crit damage roll is would be
[03:45:40] amazing Every Time We Touch I what if
[03:45:44] hypothetically Every Time We Touch I got
[03:45:47] this feeling and let's also assume for
[03:45:48] the sake of argument that every time we
[03:45:50] kissed I swore I could fly would it then
[03:45:53] be reasonable to assume
[03:45:57] that I would need this to last need you
[03:46:00] by my
[03:46:08] side
[03:46:20] chat what if I spin and then roll it you
[03:46:23] think I'll get good luck if I
[03:46:28] spin let me move my headset wire so
[03:46:30] doesn't get tangled let me actually turn
[03:46:32] my headset turn my headset off I'm going
[03:46:34] to spin and then
[03:46:38] click
[03:46:45] okay it's it's if we had it's not bad
[03:46:48] it's not bad if we had C2 rizzly it
[03:46:51] would be good slice why are you laughing
[03:46:54] it was going great until you started
[03:46:57] shouting [ __ ] off
[03:47:08] okay
[03:47:10] this is actually good though okay am I
[03:47:13] coping this is actually good but who on
[03:47:15] the set wants that
[03:47:17] ER
[03:47:21] Scrat no one but soon it'll be
[03:47:27] good topaz is so
[03:47:31] good
[03:47:38] sskk
[03:47:42] okay this is actually not bad for
[03:47:43] actually a key piece cuz it's a lot of
[03:47:45] crit damage ER it's a set that gives
[03:47:46] crit rate so I like it good piece to to
[03:47:49] keep could have been better could have
[03:47:51] been worse in life you need to be
[03:47:55] grateful of the small things because if
[03:47:59] you aren't then you can't appreciate the
[03:48:02] big
[03:48:07] things boom yeah I spoiled that for
[03:48:14] myself uh is there any double crit piece

[03:55:00] this 21 can you do something for
[03:55:07] me
[03:55:09] if you don't try you don't know I like
[03:55:10] the way you think no I like the way you
[03:55:13] think N I like the way you
[03:55:19] think Doctor Strange could imagine 10
[03:55:21] timelines and you don't know in which
[03:55:23] timeline you belong to until you find
[03:55:25] out which timeline is your timeline and
[03:55:28] my
[03:55:29] timeline my timeline's defense okay
[03:55:32] we're in the defense timeline I don't
[03:55:34] want to talk about this okay I don't
[03:55:35] want to talk about it I don't want to
[03:55:36] talk about it it looks good if there's a
[03:55:38] character who skill on HP defense and
[03:55:39] crit it would be
[03:55:41] good but for now I don't want to talk
[03:55:44] about it because that character does not
[03:55:48] exist do I have an attack s for rizzly
[03:55:50] no I
[03:55:58] don't fan Beast wait actually she
[03:56:02] doesn't really want crit damage though
[03:56:04] she doesn't need it
[03:56:07] but
[03:56:16] okay we move on to Golden
[03:56:20] troop the set that we mainly currently
[03:56:23] are looking for because there's a lot of
[03:56:25] characters that can use this and for
[03:56:26] some reason we have good albo and Nita
[03:56:29] pieces we're going to start with some
[03:56:31] copium
[03:56:37] circlets susqu why because we got good
[03:56:40] pieces on it I really need a good fishal
[03:56:42] set and we got pieces for albo and Nita
[03:56:46] there is no Suk here why are you guys
[03:56:48] typing
[03:56:58] Suk L there
[03:57:00] mons dude if Leakes didn't exist you
[03:57:03] guys would think I'm the best theorist
[03:57:05] cuz I predicted so much and now if I
[03:57:08] talk about them like oh it's leaks dude
[03:57:10] why would they release a fishing sword
[03:57:13] that increases your skill damage and
[03:57:15] then a bunch of [ __ ] blacksmith [ __ ]
[03:57:17] that [ __ ] your
[03:57:21] HP
[03:57:27] anyways TR this seven
[03:57:30] months yeah that's it I already done it
[03:57:32] okay all right what should we level
[03:57:34] first These circlets suck we'll do let's
[03:57:36] check the flowers people flowers in chat
[03:57:39] nope uh I mean we could try to get
[03:57:42] another crit stat because as they say
[03:57:44] you never know until you know uh and I'm
[03:57:46] not one to go against uh uh what they
[03:57:49] say so let's
[03:57:50] see could be fine for official but I
[03:57:53] don't really want to level
[03:57:55] that uh cuz we already have a better
[03:57:57] flower this one is double
[03:58:00] crit dude if this only rolls crit I will
[03:58:03] POG champ but double so these are the
[03:58:05] lowest rolls and it's only three sub
[03:58:07] stats but I'm not going to complain
[03:58:09] about uh double crit cuz I'm not out of
[03:58:12] touch okay I'm not going to be the
[03:58:13] streamer who complains about a double
[03:58:15] crit past okay I am very grateful okay
[03:58:19] I'm where did my rolls go this
[03:58:23] unironically looks plus like eight
[03:58:32] maybe okay no flowers for us maybe a
[03:58:35] feather okay maybe a feather um
[03:58:39] um none of these feathers have two crit
[03:58:41] stats but that's
[03:58:44] okay because this one has HP crit HP
[03:58:47] what if it gets another crit you
[03:58:54] know energy
[03:58:57] recharge could be a fav
[03:59:04] user not going to lie I can't really
[03:59:06] think of
[03:59:07] one can't really think of a time I would
[03:59:09] use
[03:59:14] this Fab
[03:59:22] Faron okay we got flat HP that makes
[03:59:25] things
[03:59:33] easy now for the pieces we actually care
[03:59:37] about
[03:59:39] first of
[03:59:42] all let's see if we get double crit on
[03:59:44] any of these
[03:59:46] hands let's just see [ __ ] I didn't mean
[03:59:48] to do
[03:59:55] that why do I keep selecting stuff by
[04:00:00] accident okay no double crit all
[04:00:07] good all
[04:00:10] good wow I wonder if this one's going to
[04:00:12] get CR
[04:00:14] damage you're going to stay alive till
[04:00:16] the 4.2 stream I think I'm going to end
[04:00:18] after this then wake up again like now
[04:00:19] for like two hours and then stream
[04:00:27] again good luck crit
[04:00:30] damage
[04:00:37] okay the this could be good attack could
[04:00:39] get crit
[04:00:42] damage please surely one of these three
[04:00:45] subsiders gets a good for I'm going to
[04:00:47] skip it nope
[04:00:49] unlucky I have to scroll down every time
[04:00:52] uh this sand could get crit
[04:00:56] rate this takes so
[04:01:01] long oh
[04:01:04] God I want to
[04:01:06] cry I'm drained of all my
[04:01:12] energy let could get crit
[04:01:18] rate I'm going to plus eight it call me
[04:01:20] crazy but I have a feeling about this
[04:01:21] piece
[04:01:26] X2 okay it
[04:01:31] sucks Gamba on goblet I'm begging dude
[04:01:34] why did I VIP a Gamba addict this guy
[04:01:37] keeps asking asking to Gamba okay [ __ ]
[04:01:40] it I like the way you
[04:01:41] think in
[04:01:47] game Chad I have a theory maybe we used
[04:01:51] up all of our bad luck and now all that
[04:01:54] is left is our good luck for the most

[04:21:27] is Gen official water comes in many
[04:21:29] flavors to the Discerning pet monat's
[04:21:32] water is crisp and pure while water from
[04:21:35] Le fully
[04:21:37] postponed in
[04:21:39] enuma a depth of flavor unlike then they
[04:21:42] said they said the day so it's not like
[04:21:44] at at 8:00 p.m. they said the day might
[04:21:47] be a different day damn [ __ ] must Beed
[04:21:50] Patiently I mean I guess that means I
[04:21:51] can sleep more before
[04:21:54] topaz
[04:22:05] [ __ ] uh uh I mean stay tuned for when
[04:22:08] they say when it is I guess
[04:22:14] but
[04:22:21] damn got no time to
[04:22:26] lose
[04:22:27] sorry stay in the
[04:22:35] middle
[04:22:48] I mean honestly for me this means I can
[04:22:50] sleep longer so that's a win but I don't
[04:22:53] really know the situation of what
[04:22:54] happened so I hope
[04:22:57] everything's yeah sad
[04:23:03] but like the Nita tweet I like this one
[04:23:05] you want me to
[04:23:08] fine traveler you're finally here I've
[04:23:12] been waiting for
[04:23:23] you so many blue check marks it disgusts
[04:23:27] me it disgusts
[04:23:34] me this rizzly video
[04:23:37] huh there's a ton of credit
[04:23:47] coupons don't you have one I used to
[04:23:49] have one and then they changed Twitter
[04:23:50] to X and now I lost
[04:23:59] it
[04:24:01] damn how's G what happened so the live
[04:24:04] stream is delayed but they said that
[04:24:07] that the one on the 27th which is today
[04:24:09] will be postponed and they didn't say
[04:24:11] till when and because they said the day
[04:24:13] is postponed it makes me think that it's
[04:24:15] going to be another day it could be a
[04:24:16] different hour makes me think it might
[04:24:17] be another day which means for now I'm
[04:24:19] just going to plan to wake up early to
[04:24:20] check and then wake up again for topaz
[04:24:23] and I'll stream topaz pride in

[04:24:35] like 3:00 p.m. for topad maybe we'll see
[04:24:37] maybe
[04:24:43] earlier I so hyped me too but I mean I

[04:34:34] sure I was testing to make sure that
[04:34:35] there were no bugs cuz if there was I
[04:34:36] would report it in the bug AB section so
[04:34:38] they would know and Patch

[04:34:46] [Laughter]
[04:34:52] streamer okay well uh we were
[04:34:59] trying okay chat Fin's not out but by
[04:35:03] the time this video is out finina is
[04:35:04] either out or soon to be out so I'm
[04:35:06] going to say this assuming finina needs
[04:35:08] one of the new sets if she doesn't then
[04:35:10] I will re-record this okay but with that
[04:35:12] in mind I'm going to say this we tried
[04:35:14] to build finina and we got some pieces
[04:35:18] but instead albo got built and for
[04:35:21] somehow we got literally the best
[04:35:22] defense ends we've ever seen ever uh
[04:35:24] some low rolls but still like 40 over 45
[04:35:27] crit value which is really good um so
[04:35:29] somehow and a good D
[04:35:32] goblet and some other stuff we got a
[04:35:34] good feather for characters look at this
[04:35:36] wait where is it not bad a lot of good
[04:35:39] rolles we also got I mean goblet we got
[04:35:43] like we got a Sans that didn't suck
[04:35:45] right this s wait where is it no we
[04:35:46] didn't didn't I get a good Sans it's
[04:35:47] just the oh this HP one's not bad hp's
[04:35:50] not bad mostly the defense ones though
[04:35:51] which is really good but only for albo
[04:35:53] and maybe some I don't know some Geo
[04:35:57] character but hus is like I mean golden
[04:36:00] troop is like albo's best slot if you're
[04:36:01] using cabar and like Goro so not bad not
[04:36:05] bad wrong character
[04:36:06] though y HP what do you mean y
[04:36:10] HP let's light it
[04:36:13] up you're an HP bur for
[04:36:22] it yeah I said it you're
[04:36:34] HP
[04:36:35] maybe Ki will call you tall for
[04:36:44] that damn okay well uh so okay update I
[04:36:48] was going to stream three times in two
[04:36:49] days if this is today if this stream is
[04:36:52] today or tomorrow or whatever I will
[04:36:54] stream it okay let me know add me in my
[04:36:57] Discord if it's like right now whatever
[04:37:02] but ask someone to wake me up ask
[04:37:05] [ __ ] zff for Fang to FaceTime me but
[04:37:07] uh outside of
[04:37:09] that I'm going to
[04:37:14] sleep uh and then I'm going to stream
[04:37:17] again for topaz's na release maybe a
[04:37:21] little bit after the banner tomorrow
[04:37:22] afternoon or today afternoon technically
[04:37:25] probably around 12 hours I'll start my
[04:37:26] stream we'll test obz out play her her
[04:37:28] and nummy I'm going to upload a quick
[04:37:31] guide of that to my second Channel I
[04:37:33] would do a full guide on the main
[04:37:34] Channel but as I said I can't can't uh
[04:37:36] talk about her maybe test some stuff out
[04:37:39] together see what we think uh off stream
[04:37:41] before I go to bed I'm probably going to
[04:37:43] uh gear my jinguan cuz you want to you
[04:37:45] can use him with her so I want to make
[04:37:47] sure he doesn't suck um unfortunately I
[04:37:49] have no air addition like cone I mean I
[04:37:51] could level one of these but like the uh
[04:37:54] where's the followup attack one I mean
[04:37:55] this one's not bad I mean even
[04:37:57] seriousness is fine but the only what I
[04:37:58] have is this so we're going to use this
[04:38:00] uh whatever it's not bad I mean it's not
[04:38:02] great but it's not whatever so uh that's
[04:38:03] going to happen and then we're probably
[04:38:05] going to do uh swarm maybe if she's
[04:38:09] good my swarm isn't that far so I don't
[04:38:11] have any of like really good Buffs which
[04:38:13] makes it more
[04:38:17] realistic so
[04:38:21] yeah that's that and then whenever the
[04:38:23] 42 live is we'll watch it thanks for
[04:38:24] watching guys I love you guys I'm back

[04:38:29] also account reviews are going to happen
[04:38:31] hopefully this week I'm going to be
[04:38:32] opening editor apps uh obviously we
[04:38:34] still have some some really good editors
[04:38:35] but I want like one or two more just for
[04:38:37] some stuff uh and then we'll watch live
[04:38:39] stream whatever it is account reviews

[04:38:42] Play account as well thanks for watching

[04:38:50] b hour I uh oops I'm unmuted I do end at
[04:38:54] a at a degenerate
