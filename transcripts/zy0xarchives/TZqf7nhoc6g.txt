[00:14:11] first of all
[00:14:13] hello [ __ ] you if you're watching this
[00:14:15] [ __ ] you
[00:14:16] uh second of all it's a Gengar shirt
[00:14:18] there's gengars on it so I don't care
[00:14:20] [ __ ] you third of all
[00:14:22] I don't understand what's happening now
[00:14:25] I'm not now I'm not known to be a
[00:14:27] mathematician or anything but I don't
[00:14:30] think these numbers add up so why is my
[00:14:32] CPU at 81 if we have 16 so 16 right wait
[00:14:37] what the [ __ ] just happened 16 plus 10
[00:14:39] that's 26. you add like this like
[00:14:41] another 10. let's say you know what
[00:14:43] let's round it up let's say 40. then
[00:14:45] another 15 here that does not add up
[00:14:48] the [ __ ] is happening
[00:14:53] sort by CPU
[00:14:58] it's literally the same thing
[00:15:03] oh it is what it is
[00:15:05] it is what it is if I lag if I crash uh
[00:15:08] no promises I have to open my PC again
[00:15:10] so okay listen
[00:15:12] I install I don't know why
[00:15:18] I did have to do a Windows update so
[00:15:20] maybe the Windows update affected me
[00:15:26] system main [ __ ] is that
[00:15:30] but it's not just the system update uh I
[00:15:35] also I also have to I installed a new
[00:15:38] secondary hard drive because my first
[00:15:40] one stopped working my first one stopped
[00:15:42] working a while ago and I ran out of
[00:15:43] storage downloading the new [ __ ]
[00:15:45] gentian patch like a few streams ago
[00:15:48] so I I installed the new I did two
[00:15:51] things today I installed a a [ __ ]
[00:15:55] uh Elgato capture card in my computer
[00:15:57] like a 4K 60 like slot thing so I did
[00:16:00] that PCI whatever the [ __ ] it's called
[00:16:01] then I also installed a new SSD
[00:16:05] now
[00:16:07] the thing about the SSD
[00:16:09] is it's the secondary one it's the
[00:16:11] [ __ ] D drive so it shouldn't [ __ ]
[00:16:13] matter
[00:16:13] but
[00:16:17] Maybe
[00:16:19] I [ __ ] with the first one on the way
[00:16:21] there I don't know I I like turnip he
[00:16:24] said I heard a whirring noise and I was
[00:16:25] like [ __ ] so then I I re I like open it
[00:16:28] again fix it a little and that was fine
[00:16:29] but I don't know what the [ __ ] well
[00:16:31] actually that's not even true I just
[00:16:32] restarted it was fine it was once it was
[00:16:34] like two frames it was like two frames
[00:16:36] and then I restarted it and that was
[00:16:37] fine it's been fine so I don't know what
[00:16:39] the [ __ ] why my CPU is high it's like 85
[00:16:41] right now
[00:16:42] I don't know why maybe like the main CPU
[00:16:45] got [ __ ] by the second one because
[00:16:47] it's under my GPU I think or like like
[00:16:49] the motherboard has like a thing and
[00:16:51] then a thing
[00:16:52] I don't know
[00:16:53] I don't know why
[00:16:56] but it is what it is I'll figure it out
[00:16:57] after the Stream
[00:16:59] what are you saying okay so there's
[00:17:01] there's I'm pretty sure one of my like
[00:17:03] my main SSD is hidden for my GPU and
[00:17:06] then I have another one that I just
[00:17:07] installed
[00:17:11] anyways
[00:17:15] it's not my temps I have nine fans my
[00:17:17] temps are fine
[00:17:18] like um like I don't know if I can show
[00:17:20] this on stream one sec
[00:17:22] I can yeah I can
[00:17:25] um
[00:17:29] yeah like my temperature's fine they're
[00:17:31] just chilling I'm not it's not hot at
[00:17:32] all but I don't know
[00:17:34] what the [ __ ] is [ __ ] up here
[00:17:45] oh wait I said I changed CPUs wait I'm
[00:17:47] [ __ ] stupid I meant okay I
[00:17:50] I changed it was a while ago I changed
[00:17:52] ssds today I'm [ __ ] stupid okay we
[00:17:55] back that up I changed ssds today that's
[00:17:57] what I changed and there's an SSD under
[00:17:59] my GPU
[00:18:01] um which I changed and then no I didn't
[00:18:02] change that one that one I kept but I
[00:18:03] choose the other one that was under it I
[00:18:05] I don't know dude my brain
[00:18:12] um because usually when I stream I see
[00:18:13] who's at like 40 usage right now
[00:18:17] it is at 85 percent
[00:18:20] so something [ __ ] up
[00:18:22] I don't know what I just I the one of
[00:18:24] them wasn't working so I threw it I put
[00:18:27] well I have it here I chucked it I put a
[00:18:29] new one in
[00:18:30] how would that [ __ ] anything up
[00:18:39] I don't know
[00:18:41] SSD might be incredible it's the same
[00:18:43] SSD as the other one I just upgraded it
[00:18:44] like more space it's the same one it's
[00:18:46] Samsung whatever the [ __ ]
[00:18:49] I don't know
[00:18:51] I'm not gonna antivirus how the [ __ ]
[00:18:53] would I get a virus from putting an SSD
[00:18:55] in
[00:19:01] to be fair I installed this what is this
[00:19:06] I installed one thing but there's no
[00:19:09] [ __ ] virus in it
[00:19:11] I installed Crystal disk info
[00:19:18] not a [ __ ] virus
[00:19:23] how do you know okay it's all that
[00:19:26] smells good anyways

[00:19:41] webcam it should be fine
[00:19:43] is your PC downloading Windows update it
[00:19:44] shouldn't be usually there's like a
[00:19:46] Windows thing here when it needs an
[00:19:47] update it did download it just did so
[00:19:49] maybe that's why but I don't know I

[00:29:40] of storage because my computer kept
[00:29:41] filling up I couldn't download gansion
[00:29:42] patches then I also installed a capture
[00:29:44] card so I could stream Final Fantasy on
[00:29:46] the PS5 then which is a waste of money
[00:29:49] by the way don't well the game isn't but
[00:29:51] the PS is but
[00:29:54] download Final Fantasy great game use my
[00:29:56] link but the plate like mine the side

[00:30:04] worry can you not PS4 it or do you have
[00:30:07] the PS5
[00:30:10] I think PS4 is goated but PS5 is like
[00:30:12] they don't have enough games that's like
[00:30:14] two
[00:30:18] yeah
[00:30:20] finally call to stream I'm being honest
[00:30:23] I'm not gonna lie
[00:30:26] huh

[00:30:33] those two things now my my [ __ ]
[00:30:35] computer no my CV is fine now it was
[00:30:36] just [ __ ] about first but now it's

[00:30:48] that also by the way I'm like actually
[00:30:50] really excited to play Final Fantasy
[00:30:52] because I played uh a bit of the other
[00:30:54] games and I'm A Cloud Sim so I want to
[00:30:56] try 16. ironically just okay I just
[00:30:59] listened
[00:31:00] I just don't know how to [ __ ] use a
[00:31:02] [ __ ] PlayStation because I only I
[00:31:04] played like bloodborne on the [ __ ]
[00:31:05] yeah it is it's fine I only played
[00:31:08] bloodborne and God of War on PS so I'm
[00:31:10] like not used to the console that's the
[00:31:12] only thing you ever thought about
[00:31:13] playing Xeno Blade
[00:31:17] um anyways that's not the point
[00:31:20] s Xenoblade no because I hate shulk
[00:31:23] because I play Smash ultimate and
[00:31:25] whenever he screams backslash I want to
[00:31:27] backslash myself off a cliff in a video
[00:31:29] game so shawl can go [ __ ] himself
[00:31:31] anyways
[00:31:33] um what was it gonna say
[00:31:35] yeah after that dude after I was gonna
[00:31:37] record like a new beta video that's like
[00:31:39] the plan but I kind of didn't have time
[00:31:41] so I was like you know what I could
[00:31:42] either record or I could be a efficient
[00:31:44] streamer I prepped the I was like
[00:31:46] testing the the the Final Fantasy stuff
[00:31:49] I didn't play it yet but like I was like
[00:31:50] testing to see if it works it started
[00:31:52] like like my uh Elgato capture card was
[00:31:54] like lagging because I [ __ ] up the
[00:31:56] full screen but now I fixed it so it's
[00:31:57] good then I worked out then I ate a
[00:31:59] [ __ ] steak with potatoes and
[00:32:01] mushrooms and then I showered and now

[00:34:20] different stream so there's another Dev
[00:34:22] post Dev interview reminder the last one
[00:34:24] they said uh spiral Abyss causes
[00:34:26] excessive anxiety which is true uh and
[00:34:29] then they said [ __ ] you friend game but
[00:34:31] now
[00:34:32] multi-layered map we hear you developers
[00:34:35] discussion
[00:34:36] all right let's read how do I make this
[00:34:37] bigger
[00:34:38] but I wanted to be like
[00:34:41] I have my RuneScape open uh leaked I had
[00:34:44] that put this here

[00:34:58] I'm in a Mode called anxiety
[00:35:06] anyways I'll just keep it full screen
[00:35:08] whatever
[00:35:10] hello Mr strimmer thanks for the stream
[00:35:12] situation here in Hong Kong is not
[00:35:15] looking too good so thank you very much
[00:35:18] move your face cam move your face
[00:35:21] cam
[00:35:24] but then chat over it
[00:35:27] no no I don't like this
[00:35:28] I'm just gonna do like this is fine
[00:35:31] right
[00:35:31] yeah let's just read it
[00:35:33] okay dear traveler the newest developer
[00:35:36] discussion has arrived we'd like to
[00:35:37] share optimizations that will be
[00:35:39] released as soon as possible as the
[00:35:42] story progresses Travelers will discover
[00:35:44] underground regions cool you can oh wait
[00:35:46] what is this now in version 4.0 players
[00:35:49] can use the I can't read okay now
[00:35:53] starting at 4.0 everyone can use the map
[00:35:55] to gain more concise details whether
[00:35:57] they are in a new or unlocked area
[00:35:58] certain areas may be complex and terrain
[00:36:01] and Encompass multiple layers so now we
[00:36:03] have a multi-layer map you can see her
[00:36:04] underground and stuff it's actually
[00:36:05] pretty cool uh I'm happy that they added
[00:36:07] the fourth thing next to symbols because
[00:36:09] when you're doing a daily commission and
[00:36:10] then you teleport underground but then
[00:36:11] turns up it was up and then you teleport
[00:36:12] up but it turns out it was in the middle
[00:36:14] and then you have to jump down and you
[00:36:15] can't find it then you miss it
[00:36:17] not fun but this is cool
[00:36:20] um the developers are also following up
[00:36:23] it's overall experience by the quest
[00:36:24] system first we would like to share
[00:36:26] everyone optimization's going 3.8 oh
[00:36:28] also this kind of confirms Montana right
[00:36:29] so like 3.8 and then here it says 4.0 so
[00:36:33] we can kind of assume that it's just 3.8
[00:36:35] in front end just by the way
[00:36:38] um yeah
[00:36:40] all right
[00:36:43] Quest tracking optimizations when an
[00:36:45] objective is a certain distance from a
[00:36:47] traveler's current position they can
[00:36:48] click navigate to up in the map and
[00:36:49] Orient themselves
[00:36:52] wait what
[00:37:04] it auto opens the map oh okay yeah
[00:37:06] that's cool yeah you just yeah that's
[00:37:08] starrell feature actually start rail
[00:37:09] feature persistent that's good cool
[00:37:12] presence track is a word for daily
[00:37:13] commissions after 3.8 tracker Travelers
[00:37:15] will automatically track their next
[00:37:17] commission based on distance and other
[00:37:18] factors oh
[00:37:21] oh [ __ ] wait that's cool you just track
[00:37:24] four commissions that's cool
[00:37:26] when the hangout event comes to I don't
[00:37:28] care about hangout Quest menu display
[00:37:30] okay we might as well read it foreign
[00:37:36] comes to an annual game the review
[00:37:38] invitation button wow that's cool
[00:37:42] Quest menu display optimizations sorry
[00:37:45] in the certain rules the request
[00:37:46] optimize red dots to be displayed
[00:37:49] what red dots will be displayed more
[00:37:51] intuitively at the same time the rules
[00:37:53] for sorting Argo quests
[00:37:54] I mean okay quality of life I guess sure
[00:37:57] but all the big stuff haha the big stuff
[00:38:00] where is it
[00:38:01] aside from coming optimizations
[00:38:04] Al hyphen will be coming on us in
[00:38:07] version 4.0 I didn't say that the
[00:38:09] concerns that everyone mentioned
[00:38:10] regarding Quest characters being
[00:38:11] occupied by the complexity of
[00:38:12] prerequisites quests oh thank God
[00:38:17] have been noted by the development team
[00:38:19] they're
[00:38:20] seeing optimization plans
[00:38:23] indicators are rather simplistic
[00:38:24] Travelers don't need to track and sort
[00:38:26] through related quests developers
[00:38:27] therefore seen the the therefore decided
[00:38:30] to plan a more detailed redirection
[00:38:32] guide for the affected quest in the
[00:38:33] quest menu to help Travelers resolve
[00:38:35] their occupied quests
[00:38:37] additionally we also noticed that
[00:38:39] Travelers May unlock multiple story
[00:38:41] quests concurrently to use up their
[00:38:44] story Keys resulting in a build up yeah
[00:38:46] true true dude I I want to like uncap my
[00:38:50] story keys so I unlock every Quest and
[00:38:52] then oh new argon Quest comes out but
[00:38:53] then I have to do nahida's Quest first
[00:38:54] I'll hide those quests first I have to
[00:38:56] babysit Cafe I have to go feed Scara I
[00:38:58] have to kill [ __ ] dottore ah I can't
[00:39:01] thanks already
[00:39:05] we're just having [ __ ] out
[00:39:10] anyways
[00:39:12] what's up
[00:39:13] Travelers will successfully unlock many
[00:39:16] different stories along their Adventure
[00:39:18] what
[00:39:21] oh yeah they're just saying that okay
[00:39:23] they're looking into a way sure but now
[00:39:25] the big stuff
[00:39:27] there are quests and map system
[00:39:28] optimizations we would like to announce
[00:39:30] for now not too long ago Divine
[00:39:32] Ingenuity collector's chapter event was
[00:39:35] released during this time we also
[00:39:37] discovered many interesting custom
[00:39:38] domains created by the community and
[00:39:40] also heard the calls for making time
[00:39:43] limited events permanent
[00:39:45] making
[00:39:49] if only
[00:39:50] then add some uh some levels to it make
[00:39:52] it you know scalable difficulty add some
[00:39:54] rewards maybe some untreatable weapons
[00:39:56] maybe some Primo gems make it cooperable
[00:39:58] maybe a repeatable end game I'm sorry
[00:40:00] I'm coping
[00:40:02] yeah the [ __ ] Labyrinth one is sick
[00:40:04] anyways here we're like to take the
[00:40:06] opportunity and chat with everyone
[00:40:07] regarding our thoughts about permanent
[00:40:09] game modes
[00:40:13] events the development team has already
[00:40:15] considered the possibility of making
[00:40:17] them permanent fixtures during the
[00:40:19] Inception of their development however
[00:40:21] based on our evaluations certain
[00:40:22] gameplay events are not fleshed out
[00:40:24] enough in terms of content to support
[00:40:26] long-term gameplay existence for
[00:40:27] everyone we will combine the feedback
[00:40:29] from our Travelers regarding event
[00:40:30] gameplay for future iterations and will
[00:40:33] release new permanent gameplay options
[00:40:36] hey
[00:40:39] maybe maybe nothing's out yet but this
[00:40:42] is a good sign
[00:40:44] in the future the development team will
[00:40:45] continue to plan more permanent con wait
[00:40:46] this is yeah this literally confirms it
[00:40:48] in the future the development team will
[00:40:49] continue to plan more permanent content
[00:40:51] we hope to bring more interesting to
[00:40:53] whatever
[00:40:56] dude
[00:40:58] don't be too trusting yeah but like
[00:41:00] imagine if domains domain expansion
[00:41:06] they add Gojo to gentian genjin impact
[00:41:09] collab
[00:41:11] impact fortnite collab
[00:41:15] what if they get Jungkook from Cookie
[00:41:17] Run Kingdom Sierra takes in 31 months
[00:41:18] appreciate it how you been
[00:41:22] okay no but seriously though seriously
[00:41:23] though
[00:41:25] um this is huge because a lot of events
[00:41:27] have really fun content but it's like it
[00:41:28] leaves after two years like you make
[00:41:29] sick-ass custom domains and they're
[00:41:30] [ __ ] gone Mario Maker where's my
[00:41:34] it's gone
[00:41:35] so that's cool also I think events
[00:41:39] some event ideas could be what endgame
[00:41:41] should be if they like make it into a
[00:41:42] fully fledged game mode like they're
[00:41:43] saying they said fully flashed I love
[00:41:46] flash so they could literally make it
[00:41:47] into like the Labyrinth event but it
[00:41:50] goes actually harder and then you have
[00:41:52] to do with your friends and then you can
[00:41:53] get like rewards and you do it like once
[00:41:54] a week boom weekly Labyrinth hey guys
[00:41:57] did you do your labyrinth let's
[00:41:58] Labyrinth
[00:42:02] also to the people saying yep TCG 2.0 if
[00:42:05] they added like a hard TCG event like
[00:42:08] PVE that's actually fun it might be I
[00:42:09] don't care I'm down or if they add rank
[00:42:11] but they're never gonna add rank dude
[00:42:13] why don't they just make it a separate
[00:42:14] app make TCG a separate app include a
[00:42:16] rank ladder system so gotcha players
[00:42:18] aren't bitching about it because it's a
[00:42:19] separate app and then you could just
[00:42:21] play it and then it's boom there you go
[00:42:23] and then I get rank one
[00:42:32] can't wait for Horst to hand pick the
[00:42:35] worst events to make permanent
[00:42:41] foreign
[00:42:43] event okay there was a labyrinth and you
[00:42:45] walked through it it's actually pretty
[00:42:46] fun and then at the end they give you
[00:42:49] 1600 no they give you either either 2
[00:42:52] 000 resin
[00:42:53] 5 000 Primo Gems or you could pick a
[00:42:56] five star to guarantee on the standard
[00:42:58] Banner true true that's what it did true
[00:43:01] that's coming back true real I was there
[00:43:04] I was there type balls if it's true and
[00:43:06] you were there
[00:43:07] and then we'll see how many people are
[00:43:09] telling the truth see everyone's gonna
[00:43:10] type balls thank you Chad
[00:43:12] true
[00:43:23] yeah don't worry they're adding a pick a
[00:43:25] standard Banner five star character in
[00:43:27] 4.0
[00:43:28] there's gonna be a French man called
[00:43:33] what's like a generous word in France
[00:43:38] what's a name that starts with a g J
[00:43:41] Paul
[00:43:43] and then and then you go up to him he's
[00:43:46] like oh welcome to from them and then
[00:43:48] because he's generous you get to pick a
[00:43:50] free uh standard Banner five star
[00:43:52] character but if you pick the wrong one
[00:43:54] some people in Fontan Unfortunately they
[00:43:58] just don't aren't welcoming to certain
[00:44:00] characters on the standard Banner so if
[00:44:01] you pick the wrong one namely uh furry
[00:44:04] with big ears you get kicked out of
[00:44:05] Fountain and then you have to like you
[00:44:07] go through a questline to get back in
[00:44:11] they hate ears
[00:44:16] anyways
[00:44:26] have you seen the leaked oiled and
[00:44:28] shirtless I'll hide them skin yeah I
[00:44:30] have

[00:48:14] what type of breach happened what the
[00:48:16] [ __ ] is happening that like like okay we
[00:48:18] don't talk about it but what the [ __ ] is
[00:48:19] happening but with that said I am very

[00:48:24] know is I'm excited that's it I know
[00:48:26] nothing else I've seen nothing else eyes
[00:48:28] closed ears closed no mouth closed
[00:48:31] see no evils speak no evil you're no
[00:48:33] evil
[00:48:49] but I'm very hyped
[00:48:52] foreign
[00:49:00] this artifact could be the last art of
[00:49:03] the last time we entered Vermilion ever
[00:49:05] it could be it could be
[00:49:08] it could be tell me online no I'm not
[00:49:12] I'm not planting surprise
[00:49:16] this could be the last time I enter this
[00:49:18] [ __ ] wretched hell hole
[00:49:22] three-liner um okay well not everyone is
[00:49:26] a four-liner
[00:49:27] odd birth sometimes you need to prove
[00:49:29] yourself you need to like maybe you know
[00:49:31] we don't all not like not every artifact
[00:49:34] starts as the best some people some
[00:49:36] people have have some growth to do and
[00:49:39] this artifact is one of them
[00:49:46] it just got I [ __ ] I spoiled it
[00:49:49] well
[00:49:55] it seems we're gonna have to enter the
[00:49:57] domain again that's all I'm gonna say
[00:49:59] that is just a just a hypothesis
[00:50:04] foreign
[00:50:09] I'm
[00:50:11] not gonna look at the stats I'm looking
[00:50:13] at chat
[00:50:15] my peripheral is not showing me
[00:50:16] percentages though
[00:50:18] okay I mean
[00:50:20] not
[00:50:23] it's it's
[00:50:24] like two misses total
[00:50:29] uh yeah we're not using it I mean
[00:50:33] yeah yeah it's not great like it's okay
[00:50:36] it's okay if I got out of my Asia
[00:50:38] account free to play account I'm happy
[00:50:39] I'm like oh no no no but yeah no no no
[00:50:42] yeah no maybe dude
[00:50:48] what if I do one Co-op run
[00:50:50] and like it was instant so it has to be
[00:50:52] like actual like not stream Watchers
[00:50:54] this has to be like the like what an
[00:50:56] average Vermillion farmer looks like in
[00:50:58] their natural habitat
[00:51:01] hey Jew
[00:51:13] bro's on a time limit and is farming for
[00:51:15] oh [ __ ] true okay but they said hey I
[00:51:16] can't leave now dude their thing is Kuru
[00:51:19] Kuru
[00:51:22] foreign
[00:52:02] Eula sniffer
[00:52:05] I don't know why I read that I'm gonna
[00:52:06] be honest sorry
[00:52:09] in adventuring as in business you always
[00:52:12] have to seize the opportunity while it's
[00:52:14] there
[00:52:16] wait we just lost our healer the [ __ ]
[00:52:17] okay I'll go I'll go Kirara where's
[00:52:20] Kirara because I have C2 now so I can
[00:52:22] Shield my allies
[00:52:25] but if you never test the limits how can
[00:52:27] anyone know where the boundaries of
[00:52:29] these laws are
[00:52:33] also has to do the best run so surely
[00:52:35] Eula footstand picks [ __ ] a character
[00:52:46] after using an elemental burst this
[00:52:48] character will gain nascent light effect
[00:52:50] increasing that wait did I click ready
[00:52:54] is this shirt you no it's not but I
[00:52:56] normally I I only wore it like twice
[00:52:59] because someone said it looked like the
[00:53:00] carpet at a bowling alley and I haven't
[00:53:02] worn it since
[00:53:07] it's a Gengar shirt dude [ __ ] you
[00:53:19] what's up
[00:53:27] dude what's wrong with carpets
[00:53:32] every room in my house has a big ass
[00:53:34] carpet like a rug
[00:53:43] you got this team
[00:53:45] office
[00:54:21] we have nothing to frog the [ __ ]
[00:54:23] blooms
[00:54:24] we have [ __ ] just uh
[00:54:33] again
[00:54:58] Vengeance will be mine
[00:55:00] rack and ruin
[00:55:07] Ed
[00:55:17] okay I'm in a rush and we have to
[00:55:20] speedrun so I'm getting out of here
[00:55:22] it's really important this is the
[00:55:24] slowest though oh it's [ __ ] eye it
[00:55:27] doesn't matter it's Echoes it could be
[00:55:28] good though
[00:55:33] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:55:49] I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:55:54] did he tie his hair back no I ate it
[00:55:56] wait should I do Abyss first or resin
[00:55:58] first ah
[00:56:01] then say bye dude okay let's do this is
[00:56:04] the boss we can boss
[00:56:07] we're the boss I did it last year's
[00:56:09] weekly boss I did yesterday off stream
[00:56:10] because the week was about to reset Sage
[00:56:13] all right we do this
[00:56:21] play Club Penguin yep
[00:56:24] I'm not playing Club Penguin
[00:56:28] oh yeah also in the list of [ __ ] I did
[00:56:29] today I also dude forced me to play a
[00:56:31] league game I [ __ ] hate that game but
[00:56:33] it was funny because he was like
[00:56:34] coaching me it was actually funny that
[00:56:36] game is dog [ __ ] though but it was funny
[00:56:52] do you play top no I play jungle I
[00:56:54] played an assassin against three full
[00:56:56] tanks it was not fun I wanted to
[00:57:00] actually it was kind of fun but not
[00:57:01] because of the game
[00:57:09] also I thought the thing about top
[00:57:11] laners was me like I thought it was just
[00:57:13] memes I thought like the the thing about
[00:57:15] tall planers and like The Stereotype was
[00:57:17] just a meme but then I I literally I
[00:57:19] played one game for the first time in
[00:57:20] like six years I played one game okay
[00:57:22] one and our top winner was talking about
[00:57:25] children so I reported them he got back
[00:57:27] oh I got like maybe muted or something
[00:57:28] like I got like the feedback and it was
[00:57:30] like it was like it was one game dude
[00:57:32] one game one game
[00:57:35] instantly mind the side effect yeah so
[00:57:43] shut up
[00:57:45] seems like an emergency hey
[00:57:51] hey
[00:57:52] when will the secret a lawyer oh no I
[00:57:54] just went this way
[00:57:58] I actually made an Ayla guide It's like
[00:58:00] a good guy it's like an aloe review but
[00:58:01] it is like mostly a guide so yeah you
[00:58:04] can watch it
[00:58:18] Adorn my night wait why is he not dendro
[00:58:26] midnight fantasma Gloria what is that
[00:58:29] what is timing
[00:58:33] [Laughter]
[00:58:43] all right
[00:58:52] whatever that was good enough
[00:58:54] again
[00:58:56] I'm good enough good enough okay that
[00:58:58] sucks we also I have I think I've only
[00:59:00] ever gotten two maps from this
[00:59:01] possibility the one I did offstream was
[00:59:03] also two mods and the one from last week
[00:59:04] was too mad so he
[00:59:06] receiving
[00:59:10] would be cool but a Nintendo switch
[00:59:12] Banner would be better dude dude Mario
[00:59:14] collab
[00:59:16] voiced by me
[00:59:20] and then there's a Goomba domain event
[00:59:21] we have to we have to stomp on Goombas
[00:59:26] open
[00:59:33] I'm a bad chat
[00:59:35] okay we have a bit more resin to spend
[00:59:37] but first let's Speed Run speedrun Abyss
[00:59:38] I have to play Beto but this isn't gonna
[00:59:40] be used in the video because if I make
[00:59:41] it Beto God I have to hit my parries and
[00:59:43] there's no way in [ __ ] I'm hitting a
[00:59:45] Perry on Beto so uh we're gonna have to
[00:59:47] get back into it all good our Beto is on
[00:59:49] 75 160 not bad 180 er a bit too much a
[00:59:52] bit too much we could go a bit less
[00:59:55] but it depends on the team we play
[01:00:06] oh
[01:00:08] foreign
[01:00:23] balls
[01:00:25] what is npvc music I like it it's a you
[01:00:28] guys call it all hard style NPC
[01:00:31] anyways 72.6 180 not bad
[01:00:34] we can have a bit more crit rate but
[01:00:37] creates for losers why be consistent
[01:00:40] when you can be big
[01:00:49] this is better but I don't like how much
[01:00:51] VR we have it's like too much
[01:00:53] like it's not a bad thing to have a lot
[01:00:55] of ER but I feel like
[01:00:56] I don't want to show that much ER
[01:00:58] fifteen dollars donated 15 no like how
[01:01:01] do I explain it like 15 like if I'm like
[01:01:04] be if I say like yo you go like 140 ER
[01:01:07] and I'm on like 180 it's like kind of
[01:01:09] weird like I don't even need this much
[01:01:11] but actually I kind of do because I'm
[01:01:12] gonna miss every Perry yeah
[01:01:19] thank you
[01:01:23] wait what is our zing qeon
[01:01:31] will you suck sorry might as well
[01:01:33] obviously Jay Cuttery better but is
[01:01:39] okay chat no copium right now okay
[01:01:45] oh de Luke retro version is what we
[01:01:47] should play
[01:01:49] okay no copium what is the most
[01:01:51] consistent
[01:01:52] half
[01:01:55] clay back eyes closed caulk out and
[01:01:58] you're just chilling
[01:02:05] probably just changing but
[01:02:11] yeah probably just shangling but we need
[01:02:13] a hydro you need a hydro right remember
[01:02:15] that so it has to be like Bennett Shang
[01:02:18] Ling tell me why shangling is so op but
[01:02:23] then there's no Shield
[01:02:26] I guess kokomi makes a double healer
[01:02:28] they're chilling but kokomi's not as
[01:02:29] good as like Synchro but it's fine
[01:02:31] Kirara National
[01:02:36] actually you can take actually I
[01:02:37] actually could take actually could take
[01:02:38] no but but who the [ __ ] your hydro I
[01:02:41] think zyx pits are a little bit hairy
[01:02:44] because here I guess you could sing
[01:02:46] yilon first half sing for a second
[01:02:52] actually we'll do yvon here because I
[01:02:54] don't care
[01:02:59] okay let me make sure anything's geared
[01:03:02] tell me why shangling
[01:03:05] is so op I can
[01:03:09] vaporize with no ICD
[01:03:21] hey everyone Kirara here
[01:03:43] is he still on crit bro
[01:03:47] fine
[01:03:55] good shot what team do you guys want to
[01:03:57] see so let me give you the options let
[01:03:58] me give you the options let me lay down
[01:04:00] the law right now let me give you guys
[01:04:01] the options of teams ready okay
[01:04:07] it's gonna be a bit a team of Beto so
[01:04:09] here are the options we could either do
[01:04:13] Beto as like uh okay we can either okay
[01:04:16] okay okay so okay okay so we did a four
[01:04:19] star clear remember we did that
[01:04:21] but what we used was
[01:04:23] different to what I'm going to propose
[01:04:25] right now I think we could play a
[01:04:27] aggravate team with like Beto
[01:04:31] fickle
[01:04:33] we can also do yai actually that's not
[01:04:36] four star anymore but
[01:04:39] because we did a four-star team where it
[01:04:41] was I think main character or some [ __ ]
[01:04:43] I don't know or yeah no it's Kirara
[01:04:45] whatever is one of them
[01:04:47] and sucrose
[01:04:52] um
[01:04:55] but I'm also exactly I'm also down to
[01:04:57] onfield a yay Mikko
[01:05:01] foreign
[01:05:06] thundering Mommy
[01:05:10] however I am also down
[01:05:13] I am also down to do like this
[01:05:24] I use the eye first half with baiju it
[01:05:26] was hell
[01:05:30] yeah please
[01:05:34] uh I mean we could but yeah he's not
[01:05:37] like yeah it's not official but she
[01:05:39] could on field
[01:05:44] the [ __ ] would we even play like where's
[01:05:46] where's Beto
[01:05:48] be like this kazua nahida you don't have
[01:05:51] a Healer so [ __ ] nahita I guess we'll do
[01:05:53] like baiju
[01:05:55] or yeah
[01:05:56] yeah
[01:06:02] but then at this point sucrose official
[01:06:05] is like
[01:06:06] more accessible and like will probably
[01:06:09] perform similarly
[01:06:20] but we also haven't played yeah you need
[01:06:22] resistance Interruption Beto Hershey
[01:06:25] like you can see like a little Shield T1
[01:06:26] and then you get like you got like
[01:06:27] damages at reduction
[01:06:30] but yeah no no shield on the eye is kind
[01:06:33] of kind of monkey like the shield will
[01:06:34] expire in one hit
[01:06:35] so I do think here are like by just nice
[01:06:38] but but then this is three five stars
[01:06:39] stop stalling you have 30 minutes oh
[01:06:41] [ __ ]
[01:06:42] we actually have a lot of time
[01:07:03] after all he said about sucrose player
[01:07:04] in this team oh I still think sucrose
[01:07:06] feels like a pile of dog [ __ ] I I made
[01:07:07] that clear I never said she I think
[01:07:09] she's clunky as [ __ ] I've never said she
[01:07:11] isn't she just can perform as good but
[01:07:14] it's like who the [ __ ] cares when it
[01:07:16] feels disgusting on field it is true it
[01:07:18] just she does objectively objectively
[01:07:21] she feels so clunky that doesn't make
[01:07:23] her bad you're still good this just
[01:07:25] feels so clunky
[01:07:30] and you can't group as often so there's
[01:07:32] a lot of waves of enemies you can't
[01:07:34] group and then group and then group and
[01:07:35] then Cosmo groups are like six seconds
[01:07:37] sucrose can't do that
[01:07:42] huh
[01:07:50] okay fine let's do it so Beto
[01:08:04] we are so dead by the way we are so dead
[01:08:06] by the way we are so [ __ ]
[01:08:10] let's try it
[01:08:18] keep in mind chat I don't know if my yao
[01:08:21] yao has deepwood and for some reason I
[01:08:23] can't check okay I'm gonna check I'm
[01:08:24] sorry I have to if I if I go all the way
[01:08:27] through and find out my Yavin is not
[01:08:28] deepwood I will I will throw it
[01:08:30] this is why I checked this is hey this
[01:08:34] is [ __ ] white dude I have too many
[01:08:36] characters I need deep one this is why I
[01:08:38] checked
[01:08:40] I mean I guess it should be instructed
[01:08:42] but dude we're not gonna heal enough you
[01:08:43] guys do you really trust me to not die
[01:08:45] like look I know in a Quicken team
[01:08:48] dungeon damage doesn't matter that much
[01:08:49] but do you really trust me to not die be
[01:08:52] honest someone be honest or not do you
[01:08:54] really trust me to not die on an
[01:08:55] instructor yeah yeah
[01:08:57] yes okay fine no you're right you're
[01:09:00] right you're right yeah instructor is
[01:09:02] actually better but dude I'm gonna die
[01:09:05] I have a dude oh my God
[01:09:08] I'm gonna die
[01:09:10] I'm gonna die
[01:09:31] if you get one shot heal doesn't matter
[01:09:33] yeah but the thing with the the so
[01:09:35] second half One Shot two first half the
[01:09:37] [ __ ] constipated beasts they don't
[01:09:39] necessarily like they'll like combo you
[01:09:41] it's like as long as you get combo in
[01:09:42] your low HP but you're not dead so you
[01:09:44] kind of want to heal up but then if your
[01:09:46] healing's dog [ __ ] you get [ __ ]
[01:09:49] wow this is a good piece
[01:10:00] okay that's actually good
[01:10:06] I do agree though that instructor is the
[01:10:07] play but I kind of don't want to
[01:10:10] whatever I'll send it

[01:50:24] been annoying Master that's fine

[01:51:30] just I started it for I got through I
[01:51:32] skipped the first cutscene just so I
[01:51:34] could test to make sure it wasn't
[01:51:35] lagging and then I started shooting so I
[01:51:37] didn't actually like watch or anything
[01:51:38] because I don't want to spoil
[01:51:41] so now we're chilling
[01:51:43] um I should be yeah I should be chilling
[01:51:49] also for colors

[01:51:55] stuff is flashing that's only when I
[01:51:57] right click don't worry
[01:52:00] yeah for colors I could change that
[01:52:01] inside or on the Elgato thing itself so
[01:52:05] let's just new game it and then if the
[01:52:06] colors are yeah like here
[01:52:08] wait should I change the brightness
[01:52:10] should I watch the brightness be okay
[01:52:12] can I keep it five or should I go ten
[01:52:17] I don't want ten but like nine wish you
[01:52:21] all a good day eight dude because I feel
[01:52:23] like five is like what they want but
[01:52:25] like look at the dungeon in the the this
[01:52:27] one the last one the dungeon
[01:52:28] it's like it looks scuffed as at like
[01:52:30] five so maybe like
[01:52:32] eight nine I think Nine's better ten is
[01:52:34] kind of
[01:52:36] seven

[01:52:48] actually I'm not a sheep we're doing
[01:52:49] eight subtitles sure vibration yup text
[01:52:52] language yeah it changes the frame rate
[01:52:54] because I wanna I don't know if I'm
[01:52:56] streaming on frame rate more than
[01:52:57] Graphics visual alerts
[01:53:01] no action focused yes sir give me combat
[01:53:04] yes
[01:53:08] what's the difference
[01:53:09] accessories that simplify gameplay oh no
[01:53:12] we don't need that we don't need that
[01:53:14] that's like baby mode I'm not a baby
[01:53:17] they're actually playing variety for
[01:53:19] once I'm just not used to using a
[01:53:20] controller but other than that I'm hype
[01:53:23] okay you guys ready
[01:53:25] we can change the colors if we need to
[01:53:26] but I think it'll be fun
[01:53:32] remember before we start before we start
[01:53:34] a few things first of all you're
[01:53:36] skill issue and type you're not allowed
[01:53:38] to type skill issue anytime anything
[01:53:39] happens I will not die I will not take
[01:53:42] damage don't type any any issue of skill
[01:53:44] that's number one number two
[01:53:49] is we're gonna be playing the demo today
[01:53:51] and tomorrow uh sometime this week well
[01:53:54] if it's well yeah sometimes this week
[01:53:55] we're gonna be continuing playing the
[01:53:57] full game of the launches and then
[01:53:59] we'll see where we go if we like it and
[01:54:01] like how it how you guys like it
[01:54:03] but I am very hyped
[01:54:06] also
[01:54:07] appear to the game now using my link
[01:54:09] either down or on the in the chat if you
[01:54:12] type the command get ready
[01:54:15] are you ready
[01:54:18] okay I'm ready
[01:54:21] it was lost the chronicler who said
[01:54:25] is the volume okay
[01:54:28] blessed light of the mother crystals
[01:54:33] this light
[01:54:35] which finally LED our forebears out of
[01:54:38] the darkness
[01:54:40] yet what they saw in the light gave rise
[01:54:44] to temptation
[01:54:47] Temptation
[01:54:49] that ever lures us back into the crystal
[01:54:52] Shadow a little louder yes sir and thus
[01:54:54] did our journey begin
[01:55:00] I was like you might like it but when I
[01:55:01] change the sound just give me a second
[01:55:04] that's up in volume mixers and hot tubs
[01:55:08] I'll do this on later
[01:55:22] what the [ __ ] is happening
[01:55:24] are you on team Burger King Dragon or
[01:55:26] whatever that is Beast
[01:55:28] I'm on team bird
[01:55:44] it's a bit like on some friends wait is
[01:55:46] that on my end
[01:55:55] wait it's still a bit
[01:55:58] yes
[01:55:59] oh
[01:56:03] wait what the [ __ ] am I doing wait who
[01:56:05] are you am I the bird
[01:56:07] wait
[01:56:10] wait how do you pause wait chill chill
[01:56:12] somebody said okay chill okay whoa okay
[01:56:15] first of all who the [ __ ] am I second of
[01:56:17] all let me fix this because I was
[01:56:18] lagging a bit let me uh
[01:56:21] it's like
[01:56:22] apparently it lags if you make it full
[01:56:24] screen from like a big window so let me
[01:56:26] make it small
[01:56:27] I'm gonna full screen it
[01:56:33] one sec
[01:56:35] immersion ruined shut the
[01:56:40] wait it takes a second
[01:56:45] keep playing instead of asking chat
[01:56:46] Ultra actually yeah I'm gonna done a
[01:56:48] wall chat
[01:56:50] what's that it takes a second to load
[01:56:52] chill
[01:56:57] it takes
[01:57:01] hey Elgato do you wanna
[01:57:06] please
[01:57:08] please load

[01:57:13] please
[01:57:15] I will literally I will find you Mr
[01:57:17] Elgato and I will kiss you please
[01:57:19] because it's like tiny I could stretch
[01:57:21] it to make it bigger but it'll Auto
[01:57:23] resize the full screen once the game
[01:57:24] detects but it takes a bit for it to
[01:57:26] detect I don't know why
[01:57:28] and now when it attacks it's gonna be
[01:57:29] too big
[01:57:33] let me undo
[01:57:40] oh there you go
[01:57:43] all right
[01:57:45] now we play

[04:29:07] in every variety that was fun sorry for
[04:29:09] the technical issues for a bit I didn't
[04:29:11] know it wasn't the game's fault at all
[04:29:12] it was [ __ ] Elgato was apparently
[04:29:14] it's not elgato's fault either but it's
[04:29:16] like the [ __ ] capture software is bad
[04:29:17] apparently it's like you're supposed to
[04:29:18] use well it's not bad but I didn't know
[04:29:20] how to use it like you're supposed to
[04:29:20] use the OBS thing now I know
[04:29:23] so
[04:29:24] what that means
[04:29:27] is next stream
[04:29:29] like it wasn't elgato's fault I'm not
[04:29:30] trying to like be mean to like I wasn't
[04:29:31] it was just I didn't you're not supposed
[04:29:33] to stream the [ __ ] capture thing
