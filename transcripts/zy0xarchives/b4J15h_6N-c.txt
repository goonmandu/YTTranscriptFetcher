[00:28:07] nice but at ezero dude dude the healing
[00:28:10] felt like I was trying to like it felt
[00:28:13] like I was drinking from a biodegradable
[00:28:15] paper straw and then it was biodegrading
[00:28:17] in my mouth while celebrities use their
[00:28:19] private jets to destroy the Earth while

[00:55:21] whatever they're called from like the
[00:55:22] light of the

[01:10:25] socks I hope you are having a good day
[01:10:28] thank you I'm not well I am I'm not I
[01:10:30] got byou but I appreciate your um kind
[01:10:36] words yes Crank It
[01:10:46] Up
[01:10:50] for
[01:10:52] enemy for Oblivion
[01:10:57] what is that damage our damage would be
[01:10:58] a lot higher if we had attack we're on
[01:11:00] speed for um some memory chaos stuff but
[01:11:04] it's still pretty good do I have any
[01:11:06] credits I don't feel like
[01:11:09] checking we do
[01:11:11] actually ah [ __ ]
[01:11:15] it I meant it in a good way no I know I
[01:11:17] know I'm just saying it would be a lot
[01:11:20] higher first
[01:11:23] C thanks for the
[01:11:26] issues you had a dream my team died in
[01:11:29] the first cycle dude what are you why
[01:11:31] would you dream about me dude why would
[01:11:33] you dream about me losing a run why did
[01:11:36] I even check this I have no
[01:11:38] credits that's like
[01:11:42] weird you need Sparkle turn on attack
[01:11:44] boots no attack boots are the standard
[01:11:45] on her honestly um attack boots are the
[01:11:49] standard on her but with a with her
[01:11:51] signature or a lone that applies a
[01:11:53] debuff speed can either be better or
[01:11:56] still worse depending on if it gives you
[01:11:58] an extra alt it's really hard to tell
[01:12:01] because oh why did I take that it's full
[01:12:02] of attacks e it's hard to tell because
[01:12:06] uh it depends on like everything cuz
[01:12:08] enemies can apply debuffs to themselves
[01:12:09] so it's very
[01:12:13] inconsistent
[01:12:17] um in my testing I cleared in less
[01:12:21] Cycles on 134 speed because I have her
[01:12:24] lyone and it let me just like zero
[01:12:27] cycle um but I think the standard is
[01:12:29] going to be attack if you have lyone I
[01:12:32] think attack and speed will depend on
[01:12:34] sub stats and if you get an ALT an extra
[01:12:38] alt like if you're on attack and speed
[01:12:40] [ __ ] it 10 random effects okay okay
[01:12:49] okay I okay
[01:12:53] sure okay f F
[01:12:57] okay wait but I already used it right so
[01:13:00] it's fine right
[01:13:07] I wait do I lose all the crit damage
[01:13:10] surely not wait let me check oh
[01:13:14] [ __ ] [ __ ] did I just lose all my crit
[01:13:19] damage yo that is okay
[01:13:24] wait

[01:13:52] is combat needs optimiz check off oh
[01:13:55] yeah that was probably the smarter way
[01:13:56] to do
[01:14:03] it I wait for the
[01:14:09] depart oh my god dude shut the [ __ ] up
[01:14:12] loser

[01:14:45] fridge I for the also here's the
[01:14:47] technique okay let me show you guys
[01:14:49] something if you were to spam you'll see
[01:14:51] this throughout the stream if you spam
[01:14:53] your space bar in this menu it there's
[01:14:55] like a little bit of a delay it feels
[01:14:56] kind of clunky and it takes some time
[01:14:58] before all three slices are out to
[01:15:00] actually speed this process you press
[01:15:01] your alt you turn on auto battle and
[01:15:03] then you turn auto battle off and it
[01:15:05] makes it way smoother so I do that all
[01:15:06] the time now Advanced Acron
[01:15:23] tip I meant decent weapon on top tip is
[01:15:28] V is hotkey yeah but like who's pressing

[01:31:16] uh I'm going to be honest with
[01:31:18] you I've seen dumb ideas in my chat but
[01:31:22] that might be one of the dumbest ideas I
[01:31:24] have seen yet and I've seen a lot of
[01:31:26] dumb ideas wait should I I should
[01:31:28] probably save a speed boot or two on the
[01:31:30] set right I mean those dude these sub
[01:31:31] stats are
[01:31:34] [ __ ] ah [ __ ] it dude [ __ ] this [ __ ]
[01:31:37] this I don't
[01:31:44] care well I feel like this set's going
[01:31:46] to be for some future ass character that
[01:31:47] I don't know of so like I don't even
[01:31:49] know what to keep
[01:31:52] whatever probably just like the generic
[01:31:54] stats that are
[01:31:57] good and like break effect because it's
[01:31:59] a break effect on
[01:32:03] speed uh speed we'll keep a speed one
[01:32:07] dud speed is such a [ __ ] like I swear
[01:32:10] whenever you're looking for Speed it's
[01:32:11] like literally the rarest [ __ ] in the
[01:32:18] game I mean I think it literally is but
[01:32:21] oh wait these attack points could be
[01:32:22] good what the [ __ ] speed and crit damage
[01:32:28] when are you not looking for Speed dude
[01:32:31] my entire life has been trying to get
[01:32:34] enough speed and then Sparkle comes out
[01:32:36] and now I don't even need [ __ ] like
[01:32:38] like I still need speed on my supports
[01:32:39] but like my DPSS are like in a in a in a
[01:32:41] like a Time Loop where I don't know what
[01:32:44] the [ __ ] to do
[01:32:45] anymore it's fine okay uh let's make uh
[01:32:49] some
[01:32:52] [ __ ]
[01:32:55] why did I go there should I do the
[01:32:58] new no no no no okay let's do
[01:33:02] feet three [ __ ]
[01:33:06] it okay
[01:33:20] okay dude just know that each one of
[01:33:23] these is - 10 five star
[01:33:25] relics each one of these is minus 10
[01:33:29] minus [ __ ] 10 minus [ __ ] 10 minus
[01:33:32] [ __ ]
[01:33:34] 10 minus [ __ ]
[01:33:43] 10 like like like like like like
[01:33:52] like
[01:34:06] -
[01:34:09] 90 okay I want to try an attack I want
[01:34:12] to have an attack build ready let's
[01:34:14] level this [ __ ]
[01:34:15] it wait let me do the one Lev
[01:34:22] thing okay
[01:34:26] yeah
[01:34:30] okay you know what give me another
[01:34:32] please actually please it would be ComEd
[01:34:34] okay that's even worse like dude like
[01:34:36] [ __ ]
[01:34:38] off dude like like like like this should
[01:34:41] be illegal there should be a law
[01:34:43] prohibiting
[01:34:52] this
[01:35:00] I like what do you want from me man I
[01:35:03] don't
[01:35:06] like wait are you thinking what I'm
[01:35:08] thinking press one if you're thinking
[01:35:10] what I'm thinking press one if you're
[01:35:13] thinking what I'm
[01:35:22] thinking
[01:35:31] okay so the problem with speed is that
[01:35:34] if I'm going like there's slow outr
[01:35:36] that's really good and then speed is
[01:35:38] pretty good with her Lon too but if I'm
[01:35:41] going speed I'm going to go speed boots
[01:35:42] not an attack boot with speed substats
[01:35:45] so it's literally useless for
[01:35:52] me
[01:35:56] wait I got another
[01:35:57] piece where is it this one yeah this

[01:37:01] like eight maybe 10 [ __ ] it 10 actually
[01:37:04] I don't have
[01:37:05] enough wait that was crit damage h no
[01:37:08] that
[01:37:09] sucks
[01:37:22] yeah all right nine pieces that should
[01:37:24] be enough minus 90 [ __ ] five star
[01:37:27] pieces that could have been used for XP
[01:37:29] but it's all
[01:37:31] good yeah gager is good for Aron iy uh i
[01:37:35] l help like E2 gives a Clans and [ __ ]
[01:37:37] and then you get more healing from
[01:37:39] others uh so it's nice the only problem
[01:37:42] with him is he has fourstar healing
[01:37:43] syndrome which makes him feel like a
[01:37:45] four-star when you're healing compared
[01:37:47] to other characters but uh it's good
[01:37:50] Dono wall wa would you
[01:37:52] ask
[01:37:55] quick select exists yeah but it doesn't
[01:37:56] let you see the stats doesn't it so it's
[01:37:58] like a waste of
[01:38:00] time I mean I guess I could just throw
[01:38:02] everything okay I'm going to do one hand
[01:38:04] and then the rest
[01:38:08] boots that's fine [ __ ] it
[01:38:14] five okay okay dude at
[01:38:22] least
[01:38:28] I mean that's
[01:38:42] fine Chad do I craft another ER Ro just
[01:38:44] for the [ __ ] of
[01:38:49] it no wait why not what if I if I get
[01:38:53] speed on it think about
[01:39:01] it ER R is not worth wait what are you
[01:39:04] yapping
[01:39:08] about attack orb dude Force crafting and
[01:39:11] attack orb is so [ __ ] though you're like
[01:39:13] why would you do
[01:39:15] that look I'll get an attack orb just
[01:39:17] randomly watch it's not that hard look
[01:39:20] see how easy that was okay fire
[01:39:22] damage
[01:39:24] all right
[01:39:31] well okay we'll just play our 134 then
[01:39:35] no
[01:39:39] fine this piece is so [ __ ] this piece is
[01:39:42] good this piece is honestly good but
[01:39:44] it's speed but it's still good this is
[01:39:46] fine this is kind of dog [ __ ] but it has
[01:39:48] speed what's my best rope yeah this one
[01:39:51] until we get the new set wait that's HP
[01:39:53] never mind where is the T one that's one
[01:39:56] that's
[01:39:59] fine okay one more simrun and then mock
[01:40:02] maybe one more Sim to get all the
[01:40:04] rewards and then mock a
[01:40:14] G new set's not out yet yet I was
[01:40:17] talking about the new uh the new planner
[01:40:18] this
[01:40:22] one
[01:40:30] actually I kind of want a memory of
[01:40:31] chos uh we should probably do this
[01:40:37] though [ __ ] it we'll come back
[01:40:44] here um parlor
[01:40:50] car do you want to enter do you want to
[01:40:53] enter the Forgotten Hall do you want to
[01:40:55] enter would you do you want to do you
[01:40:59] want to enter the Forgotten
[01:41:01] Hall [ __ ] is this one oh yeah another
[01:41:04] one's yaning right yaning
[01:41:07] Sam
[01:41:16] yeah okay
[01:41:22] acaron I kind of want dude sustained
[01:41:24] wealth is so [ __ ] fun it's actually
[01:41:26] like the most fun with acon it's not
[01:41:28] even close but I think we're going to do
[01:41:30] p for we'll play a normal team I
[01:41:35] think um
[01:41:48] yeah man if only this body wasn't was on
[01:41:51] [ __ ] wind set honestly I could force
[01:41:54] craft a wiet it might be stupid though
[01:41:57] but like do I really
[01:42:00] care like I have I have six self modul
[01:42:05] resins I could just force a hit rate
[01:42:07] [ __ ] it hope it gets
[01:42:18] speed is it even that grief it's one
[01:42:21] modeling resin I'm wasting
[01:42:24] and like I don't want to farm that
[01:42:25] [ __ ] okay wait what are the the main
[01:42:27] stat odds for an EHR body actually HSR
[01:42:29] Wiki main stat
[01:42:32] odds I don't know the odds for the main
[01:42:35] stat let me see
[01:42:38] um does it show
[01:42:41] it oh yeah it does Five
[01:42:46] Star 6.9%
[01:42:52] EHR
[01:43:00] that's not even that low
[01:43:02] honestly like speed is like harder to
[01:43:05] get I feel like oh wait is this sub
[01:43:06] stats no this main
[01:43:08] stat
[01:43:13] no no use knowing the odds just
[01:43:18] hit it's probably not worth doing this
[01:43:21] though but I kind of want to do do it
[01:43:23] anyways does that make sense I don't
[01:43:25] have the MK
[01:43:30] right why do I keep opening this menu
[01:43:33] sorry
[01:43:35] inventory do it dude why are you
[01:43:37] enabling
[01:43:50] me isn't tutorial lone enough yes
[01:43:55] s int not well it's not wait what do you
[01:43:58] mean with with sub stats yes but we
[01:44:00] don't have um one we don't have Subs Two
[01:44:04] usually we run uh I run tutorial on
[01:44:08] paila usually not with acon though with
[01:44:10] acaron I give it to Silver
[01:44:12] Wolf Z Jeff would do it no
[01:44:20] he I feel like if I do this I'm never
[01:44:23] going to use it again though after today
[01:44:25] so it might not actually be worth
[01:44:41] it try your
[01:44:46] luck no I mean I would just custom it if
[01:44:49] I care that
[01:44:52] much
[01:45:00] this is so grief though this feels like
[01:45:02] such a [ __ ]
[01:45:13] waste you don't play the game I
[01:45:21] do okay but it's content that is
[01:45:26] true this is so not worth it I don't
[01:45:28] have credits to level
[01:45:33] it blurry
[01:45:43] cam wa it's actually blurry what the
[01:45:48] [ __ ] restart
[01:45:51] it okay hello
[01:45:55] a real waste is saving those forever
[01:45:57] okay true actually I know this isn't
[01:45:59] worth it but like [ __ ] it speed okay
[01:46:01] [ __ ] you go [ __ ] yourself minus one that
[01:46:03] was actually the worst decision of my
[01:46:05] life it's fine we're still going to use
[01:46:08] it uh

[01:46:44] you're saying that's okay you you you
[01:46:46] are in too deep my friend you are in too
[01:46:49] deep you are lost in the sauce this game

[02:01:03] boots what do I even do I
[02:01:10] mean it might
[02:01:16] be I was going to say it could be a
[02:01:18] Quantum set angle but I don't even have
[02:01:20] a attack Quantum set
[02:01:23] I
[02:01:24] don't I just have speed I'm actually
[02:01:28] dude I'm actually a [ __ ] Speed
[02:01:43] Demon well that was a waste of uh
[02:01:46] everything that I
[02:01:50] owned
[02:01:53] should have played the game dude I've
[02:01:55] been farming this [ __ ] domain since
[02:01:57] it came out you don't understand how
[02:01:59] many [ __ ] Cavern of corrosion dog
[02:02:01] [ __ ] of this useless ass set I've
[02:02:05] done I know you can't tell cuz this this
[02:02:08] mid ass piece but I
[02:02:16] swear dude do I just twopiece twopiece
[02:02:19] [ __ ]
[02:02:20] it I
[02:02:23] lose eight crit rate 24 crit
[02:02:27] damage dude that is so
[02:02:31] much but I gained 12%
[02:02:42] attack
[02:02:46] honestly with that [ __ ] hand and boot
[02:02:49] quality if I'm not going speed boots it
[02:02:51] might be worth it with speed boots it
[02:02:52] isn't but if I'm doing
[02:02:55] this this might actually be
[02:02:58] better and then I can go at real
[02:03:03] rope wait this is actually not
[02:03:05] bad I think I'm cooking sorry that was
[02:03:08] weird
[02:03:17] um let me pause my music actually let
[02:03:20] play normal songs
[02:03:27] [ __ ] I launch gen instead of starl okay
[02:03:29] uh I want to Crown this I don't have the
[02:03:33] credits I mean I could get
[02:03:37] those okay let me make sure this works
[02:03:41] Sparkle
[02:03:44] 160 uh who else was
[02:03:49] there my wealth's kind of cooked
[02:03:56] but doesn't really
[02:03:59] matter cuz I can just give him random
[02:04:02] speed [ __ ] and he'll do
[02:04:12] fine honestly whoa whoa you've had your
[02:04:15] time to
[02:04:20] shine
[02:04:22] but [ __ ] you I'm sorry uh yeah [ __ ]
[02:04:28] you daa anything with speed doesn't
[02:04:32] really matter how good it is honestly
[02:04:34] [ __ ] it too speed uh speed imaginary e r
[02:04:38] r they're not even on the same set
[02:04:40] though it's probably fine 14 146 speed
[02:04:43] is not a lot but I feel like we doesn't
[02:04:46] even have to be that well invested in
[02:04:47] this
[02:04:48] team acaron has to be or you [ __ ] die
[02:04:52] but wealth just needs to like do some
[02:05:00] stuff I might die let's see okay dude
[02:05:03] let me test the waters let me test the
[02:05:04] waters if I die you're not allowed to
[02:05:06] laugh or type or you're
[02:05:08] banned this is a
[02:05:20] dictatorship all right let's try
[02:05:23] it this is my favorite team when like
[02:05:25] build correctly I just don't know if we
[02:05:28] have the investment level for it yet
[02:05:31] we'll
[02:05:32] see storm on the horizon all
[02:05:42] right I might [ __ ] die and
[02:05:45] honestly that would be funny so I don't
[02:05:47] really
[02:05:50] mind
[02:05:57] also in an Ideal World my wealth is
[02:05:59] faster than my Sparkle but I'm not

[02:09:20] minus one skill point doesn't
[02:09:26] matter I'm going to Al after he summons

[02:10:04] poop let's go wait I'm telling you this
[02:10:07] Call's broken I'm telling you you just
[02:10:09] need to believe you just need to believe
[02:10:12] and if you believe you can you get
[02:10:17] achieve that would have been a that
[02:10:18] would have been an easy this could be a
[02:10:20] zero cycle by the way I need like a tad
[02:10:22] bit more damage that would been zero
[02:10:24] cycle okay maybe a bit more than a tad
[02:10:26] bit but yeah okay anyways if welth was
[02:10:30] faster though it would have helped a lot
[02:10:32] like welth should be faster than Sparkle
[02:10:34] So we get more turns in um and debuff at
[02:10:37] the start but it's okay it's
[02:10:41] c um
[02:10:44] disclaimer you should probably play A
[02:10:46] Healer not welth but this comp is very
[02:10:50] fun
[02:10:52] anyways back to um back to business wait
[02:10:55] let's clear let's clear Sam
[02:10:57] Actually you build err on wealth you
[02:11:00] build attack or err if you're actually
[02:11:03] invested in his damage his damage is
[02:11:05] good and you go attack if you're just
[02:11:07] like very low investment just apply
[02:11:09] debuffs like I'm doing then you can go
[02:11:12] ER it
[02:11:14] depends exclamation mark it
[02:11:17] depends okay let me give his lyone back
[02:11:19] to Silver Wolf time for a
[02:11:24] bug scuffed stream how's the stream
[02:11:27] scuffed I don't get
[02:11:30] it everything's
[02:11:48] fine attack on acaron how much
[02:11:52] much as much as you can get my
[02:11:54] friend there is no uh no specific
[02:12:02] number w i [ __ ] my wos build
[02:12:05] right honestly this is still fine we're
[02:12:07] just ah it's fine whatever it doesn't
[02:12:10] matter how much does mine have probably
[02:12:13] low on 34 but usually a lot of people
[02:12:16] run attack
[02:12:18] orbs oh I'm still on [ __ ] attack
[02:12:20] boots I mean it's fine it's
[02:12:25] fine yeah it's fine it's fine it's fine
[02:12:28] it's fine caution does not mean
[02:12:30] cowardice watch this
[02:12:35] sound it might be better for
[02:12:39] us can use four quantum set on her yes
[02:12:42] but it might be okay four quantum set is
[02:12:46] really good as a like alternative right
[02:12:49] it's good but
[02:12:52] if you already if you're running paila
[02:12:55] and silver wolf it might be useless
[02:12:58] because you can only the more defense
[02:12:59] thread you have the better but you can
[02:13:01] only defense thread 100% of their
[02:13:02] defense and like P and silver wolf
[02:13:05] together is like 80 something and then
[02:13:06] the resolution lyone is another like 16
[02:13:09] or whatever and then you overcap um it's
[02:13:11] like 40 something for like 43 and then
[02:13:13] 46 or something whatever it and then
[02:13:15] silver has a bug too so if you are are
[02:13:18] running both you get over 100% defense
[02:13:20] red to where uh Quantum set is useless
[02:13:22] if you're running one of the two paa or
[02:13:24] silver wolf then it's
[02:13:33] good imortality forever crat r or damage
[02:13:37] both are fine if you have a lyone you
[02:13:39] probably want crit rate on the ciret but
[02:13:42] or whatever it's called
[02:13:43] Head
[02:13:46] uh I haven't played uh Emer in a while
[02:13:49] oh what am I doing
[02:13:54] it doesn't matter I it does
[02:13:57] matter dude I'm still in acaron mode in

[02:22:53] wrong set that's fine it doesn't matter
[02:22:55] we're here for
[02:23:02] Aron it's fine it doesn't
[02:23:08] matter trickier to crack trickier to
[02:23:11] crack
[02:23:15] for I'm going
[02:23:17] Al cuz we won't get peel out for a
[02:23:20] little bit

[02:23:35] TV uh basic
[02:23:39] skill let go
[02:23:42] here I want to reduce her resistances
[02:23:44] though cuz I want them to die at the
[02:23:45] same
[02:23:47] time how much defense this guy have down
[02:23:49] 41
[02:23:51] 15 7 what about this guy 41 15 7 okay
[02:23:56] it's the same [ __ ] it doesn't really

[02:24:00] this
[02:24:01] guy is dou
[02:24:05] speed commencing ready for
[02:24:16] another [ __ ] I'm one point off
[02:24:21] this is why I like 134 speed 134 we Al
[02:24:26] again wait does this count as wait can I
[02:24:28] break her I don't think I
[02:24:32] can did I let my field
[02:24:35] expire I did let my field expire I
[02:24:38] wanted to break her to apply a debuff so
[02:24:39] I could ult so I was like [ __ ] it I'll
[02:24:41] try it it doesn't matter though cuz
[02:24:42] she's not attacking us so it doesn't
[02:24:44] matter if we don't have a field I don't
[02:24:45] need to skill onpa do I no actually
[02:24:51] we have the upper hand sure let me stack
[02:24:54] extra
[02:24:56] debuffs uh I'm not going to Al yet cuz I
[02:24:59] can over
[02:25:02] cap we're going to skill then we're
[02:25:05] going to
[02:25:10] Al now I start with three stacks for the
[02:25:12] next enemy
[02:25:14] Sam [ __ ] you
[02:25:16] Sam probably pill
[02:25:18] out I haven't fought this boss in a
[02:25:21] minute I'm going to be honest actually
[02:25:23] that's not true I beat him with Aron
[02:25:24] earlier but eh I tend to ignore his
[02:25:28] mechanics more than I should if I'm
[02:25:31] being honest I'm going to skill this I
[02:25:33] don't get my Al yet but it's fine maybe
[02:25:35] if I get hit once
[02:25:38] basic are fine quick divination that's
[02:25:46] fine rare occasion of me actually
[02:25:48] waiting for silver VA tier
[02:25:51] oh I pled burn wait never mind wait
[02:25:53] actually I can it doesn't over cap yes
[02:25:55] okay cuz if I okay yeah I'm not even
[02:25:57] going to explain the thought process but
[02:25:58] I'm just going to all right
[02:26:01] good that was huge that was best case
[02:26:03] scenario
[02:26:06] though 442 not
[02:26:09] bad uh I'm going to
[02:26:11] skill yeah I have the skill
[02:26:14] points and then Pila you could just
[02:26:16] basic something um I kind of want to
[02:26:18] break this enemy honestly basic him cuz
[02:26:21] my ALT should break or Aron's
[02:26:31] Al fine I see through you I see through
[02:26:43] you inations all things are human
[02:26:49] creation
[02:26:57] for this okay on
[02:27:01] now I weep for the
[02:27:08] depart commencing
[02:27:14] support another
[02:27:17] Oblivion a quick please don't kill me
[02:27:23] we have Push R we're
[02:27:26] fine all right easy
[02:27:31] boss I wait for the
[02:27:43] Department I shouldn't have aled that
[02:27:45] early then fine I wonder um maybe we
[02:27:50] should try this again with different
[02:27:51] boots I wonder how fast we could clear
[02:27:53] it if we actually have better boots like
[02:27:55] with
[02:27:56] speed watch Arron's trailer yeah I have
[02:27:58] to do that still apparently was really
[02:28:00] good but I wasn't streaming when it came
[02:28:01] out so I didn't watch
[02:28:07] it okay business dude our inor was uh
[02:28:12] kind of
[02:28:15] scuffed I
[02:28:19] think oh no he wasn't wait yeah he was

[02:28:24] [ __ ] is this I had speed boots with
[02:28:28] [ __ ] cuz I yed his boots it was

[02:28:42] um dude acon and cely look [ __ ] dude
[02:28:45] like they look I okay they look so
[02:28:48] similar in the [ __ ] I
[02:28:55] still went well yeah that was fine uh so
[02:28:57] like yeah a lot of the times attack is
[02:29:00] better on Aron but I feel like for with

[02:37:13] uh I mean I think most of them are good
[02:37:15] but that was one of the better ones in
[02:37:16] my opinion uh I think Sparkle trailer is
[02:37:18] my favorite that is probably top three
[02:37:22] though that was
[02:37:25] good to be honest I some of them I
[02:37:28] forget though so I'd have to rewatch
[02:37:30] because it's been a
[02:37:38] minute wait why am I in memory chaos
[02:37:41] going to the new world
[02:37:45] again dude Sparkle trailer was something

[02:40:42] stream drops start at some point but I
[02:40:44] don't know when it starts that's why I
[02:40:46] thought it would be I thought it already
[02:40:48] started
[02:40:52] question mark dud this character is
[02:40:54] actually technique power
[02:41:03] creep

[02:41:23] freeo play players I know like 80% of
[02:41:26] them want acaron so I feel like a lot of
[02:41:28] people are saving for her but if you

[02:41:33] yeah I'm lucky for
[02:41:35] that dude okay but but dude dud d
[02:41:39] d dude we're getting uh according to the
[02:41:42] dev Liv stream according I'm not even
[02:41:44] going to use the technique according to
[02:41:45] the dev Liv stream we're getting uh
[02:41:48] simulated universe farming
[02:41:50] optimizations soon that's what they
[02:41:56] said
[02:42:06] soed creation a su skip button seems
[02:42:10] pogies you know what you know what would
[02:42:12] be even more pogies if I could have a
[02:42:14] button to skip your chat
[02:42:17] messages a quick divination
[02:42:19] as one oh wait I do mods sorry you don't
[02:42:24] have to B
[02:42:28] him uh attack but very very very very
[02:42:32] slightly to where it's just sub stats I
[02:42:34] actually don't like answering that
[02:42:35] question because the answer is sub stats
[02:42:37] attack and lightning are both fine I see
[02:42:40] through
[02:42:41] you um usually it's yeah very
[02:42:46] similar 5% difference if you have attack
[02:42:48] boots two two to 3% difference like 3%
[02:42:51] difference have speed
[02:42:57] boots
[02:43:02] wait oh no never mind I mean that could
[02:43:05] be good crit

[02:43:14] [ __ ] my okay have you never just like
[02:43:17] POG chaed okay let's say let's say

[02:43:35] suck I don't want to explain pogies
[02:43:48] anymore
[02:43:56] visit not the
[02:44:04] prim dude you can just clear the whole
[02:44:06] [ __ ] floor like
[02:44:09] this and then whenever you stop there's
[02:44:11] a
[02:44:12] popup wait I have an idea I have an
[02:44:16] idea [ __ ] I was spamming F3 I was trying
[02:44:18] to
[02:44:19] wish no it doesn't
[02:44:26] work uh we'll do an encounter [ __ ]
[02:44:36] it oh three star sure and a curio what's
[02:44:39] the Worst That Could
[02:44:41] Happen trickier to crack trickier to
[02:44:46] crack this is double speed
[02:44:52] ready for another so she isn't necessary
[02:44:54] but is worth honestly that's
[02:44:57] like as far as day one Chatters go
[02:45:00] that's one of the best descriptions I've
[02:45:06] seen as one free will or was it
[02:45:10] fate for
[02:45:12] Oblivion is the hunt path are best in
[02:45:14] Universe I don't think Hunt is the Hunt
[02:45:17] is really good for farming because it's
[02:45:18] like fast clears but I think like the
[02:45:21] best if you're like struggling is
[02:45:23] usually the paths that can help you a
[02:45:25] cheese stuff like um you can literally
[02:45:27] remembrance Perma freeze uh you can do
[02:45:30] like nihility [ __ ] nil is
[02:45:32] broken uh abundance can also cheese
[02:45:34] abundance is really good for just
[02:45:36] clearing [ __ ] you can't clear but it it
[02:45:39] takes like seven years so I [ __ ] hate
[02:45:43] it erudition oh yeah dude erudition has
[02:45:45] to be insane cuz of brain in the vat
[02:45:47] right well does that work it should work
[02:45:48] with right yeah it should it storm on
[02:45:50] the horizon it's just the the does it
[02:45:53] give you a free alt
[02:45:58] still it does okay yeah then that's
[02:46:01] broken we could do golden gears later
[02:46:06] maybe
[02:46:08] three
[02:46:14] ised

[02:49:49] creation is strangling viable why did I
[02:49:52] read
[02:49:55] that I thought that was a genuine
[02:49:57] question I saw is and viable in my
[02:50:00] peripheral so I said I'll read it it was
[02:50:02] [ __ ] changling I got [ __ ]
[02:50:04] changling

[02:50:22] Al yeah [ __ ] this
[02:50:33] guy dude it's actually optimal to save
[02:50:36] time to [ __ ] press V and Auto Battle
[02:50:39] in the middle as soon as you press your
[02:50:40] alt on
[02:50:43] acon this comat this is double
[02:50:47] speed all things human
[02:50:56] creation how muched
[02:51:00] Iain
[02:51:02] um I don't think there's a definitive
[02:51:04] answer to that I like 160 plus of my
[02:51:07] supports but there's a decent chance you
[02:51:09] can't reach that high I cleared in one
[02:51:11] cycle it could have been zero with like
[02:51:14] 140 he was slower than my Sparkle which
[02:51:17] should not have been the case but it was
[02:51:18] still
[02:51:19] F but you should probably get more than
[02:51:21] that if you
[02:51:23] can't I just
[02:51:29] showered wait why did I Al before am I
[02:51:31] [ __ ] stupid I forgot what this enemy

[03:26:59] it that wasn't a skill issue okay weld
[03:27:02] could have used the skill fair
[03:27:08] enough enemy

[03:28:00] choice uh do I have the defense debuff
[03:28:03] on him I do exposed in sarment exposed
[03:28:06] exnar I should probably use my skill but
[03:28:08] Sparkles next so I don't have the skill
[03:28:09] point to use my skill so I lose a debuff
[03:28:11] CU I can't use my skill because I don't
[03:28:12] have the skill point to use my skill so
[03:28:14] I should use my skill but I can't use my
[03:28:15] skill skill so I'm just going to basic
[03:28:17] well minus one [ __ ]
[03:28:20] debuff oh my God I'm in the same [ __ ]
[03:28:22] position as before I'm actually

[03:29:01] going like 300 probably oh wow that was
[03:29:03] disgusting okay maybe that was
[03:29:06] worse yeah that's probably

[03:33:24] our first alt we wanted to get um we
[03:33:26] wanted the enemy to hit us on either uh

[03:37:26] playing it's
[03:37:28] fine it's fine it's
[03:37:33] fine reset again dude and it's on this
[03:37:36] [ __ ] which is worse I think enemy
[03:37:40] targeted oh I crimsoned
[03:37:44] him don't ever say it's over if I'm
[03:37:49] please please please please please
[03:37:51] please okay that's fine can you find the
[03:37:56] [Music]
[03:37:58] answer headp up oh my God you are
[03:38:01] beautiful you are [ __ ] beautiful the
[03:38:03] only problem is that the the Crimson no
[03:38:05] saacks on the guy that doesn't resist
[03:38:07] lightning which means my AOE like my
[03:38:09] total damage might be lower but I think
[03:38:10] it's
[03:38:11] fine
[03:38:14] okay not total damage L but like the the
[03:38:17] tankier dude might live after I kill the
[03:38:19] not less tanky dude is my point but
[03:38:23] uh all
[03:38:25] good you know nothing survive or be
[03:38:27] destroyed there is no other
[03:38:30] choice the
[03:38:42] hand for Oblivion
[03:38:45] I I don't think this is
[03:38:56] enough man we're so close I think I need
[03:38:59] just better relics like cuz we're we're
[03:39:01] really my welth needs damage I think I
[03:39:03] think my welth should go Dam cuz he's
[03:39:05] just on speed right now he has nothing
[03:39:07] he's just on speed I think I need to
[03:39:08] give him some
[03:39:09] damage uh and we'll probably have
[03:39:14] enough
[03:39:16] why all those was Auto Battle that was
[03:39:25] me you need more Idol on no no I did
[03:39:28] this with ezero but on um on media
[03:39:31] server I had better um I had better
[03:39:33] relics not like insane relics but a bit
[03:39:36] better like my boots weren't this
[03:39:39] garbage GLE of
[03:39:43] old stay calm
[03:40:00] yeah anything that counts as a debuff
[03:40:02] like on an enemy here will count as a
[03:40:04] debuff the only thing is it's like one
[03:40:06] per action well not really cuz it's like
[03:40:08] one for like ability or some [ __ ] and
[03:40:10] also the ones that are like on the
[03:40:14] enemies uh the enemy's turn you can
[03:40:16] still it can still stack but there's
[03:40:18] some things where it's like not really a
[03:40:22] debuff like like um like fire kiss from
[03:40:25] G Fen and I think they are debuffs but
[03:40:28] they don't count like fire kiss and uh
[03:40:31] Arana when it like stacks on every enemy
[03:40:33] won't give you a a thing like you can
[03:40:35] still get like one stack from it but you
[03:40:37] won't it won't like keep stacking and
[03:40:39] fire kiss on guun Fen through my testing
[03:40:41] doesn't give you Stacks I don't know why
[03:40:44] maybe because it's like considered burn
[03:40:45] I not sure why um but I know it doesn't
[03:40:50] oh [ __ ] I wasn't supposed to
[03:40:52] Al yeah Arcana gives you one stack right
[03:40:56] like I know Arcana gives you one but
[03:40:57] then as it like reapplies it doesn't
[03:40:59] give
[03:41:02] you I don't
[03:41:07] know is it a fire MC Nots with her yes
[03:41:10] if you don't die the problem with fire
[03:41:12] MC is you might just [ __ ] die but
[03:41:15] uh High investment fire MC I've been
[03:41:17] told I have seen is pretty okay
[03:41:23] um stay
[03:41:25] calm the odds are though if your fire MC
[03:41:27] is high invest like if if your it
[03:41:29] doesn't have to be your your fire MC
[03:41:31] doesn't have to be the highest
[03:41:31] investment but you have to be high
[03:41:33] enough investment where you're killing
[03:41:34] stuff fast enough so you don't die and
[03:41:36] usually by that point you have a better
[03:41:38] healer or shielder
[03:41:40] but FMC gives you a lot of um debuffs
[03:41:44] cuz taunt plus the lyone
[03:41:47] trend so it's going work the
[03:41:53] answer this is EZ S
[03:41:58] one no I said high in investment fire MC
[03:42:01] but I think I mean more um just a higher
[03:42:03] investment team in
[03:42:14] general
[03:42:22] nothing or destroy there is no other
[03:42:25] choice can you show your stats yeah
[03:42:27] after this run oh I can show my stuff
[03:42:29] but I need to clear first uh this is
[03:42:32] enough I don't think we're killing how
[03:42:34] much damage honestly maybe I'm going to
[03:42:37] e on this
[03:42:39] guy oh I should have eat the other dude
[03:42:43] [ __ ] wait
[03:42:47] please please
[03:42:48] please yes okay we're probably [ __ ]
[03:42:51] cuz we have no debuffs but at least I
[03:42:53] know it's doable okay it's doable do I
[03:42:56] have enough skill points e q e yeah I
[03:43:01] do wait did I Target the wrong
[03:43:05] dude another Journey
[03:43:11] Oblivion we're not killing the sing in
[03:43:13] time though cuz we don't have all
[03:43:16] ready actually a if he hit paila there
[03:43:20] oh no we would have got our he from that
[03:43:21] I don't think let's begin okay oh H
[03:43:25] hitting well to to help though
[03:43:36] support let him
[03:43:39] cook yeah we don't this is going to be a
[03:43:42] one cycle this doesn't kill
[03:43:48] should I wait before alting just in case
[03:43:49] I get W
[03:43:59] Al okay that was [ __ ]
[03:44:02] stupid I mean it doesn't matter
[03:44:06] right yeah it wouldn't have killed
[03:44:09] anyways leave it to me well I'll do a
[03:44:13] bid plus one though we destroy there is
[03:44:16] no other
[03:44:25] choice yeah but it could have been zero
[03:44:27] I mean I don't think it could have been
[03:44:28] zero though
[03:44:29] 36% yeah that was
[03:44:32] one must he looks tough no no we're just
[03:44:34] trying to get zero with this team uh but
[03:44:36] I don't think it's possible well with
[03:44:38] the team it is but with our build I
[03:44:40] don't think it
[03:44:44] is
[03:44:47] storm on
[03:44:50] the [ __ ] it
[03:44:56] PE stay calm I could try Ron May though
[03:45:01] with a 134 speed actually what's the
[03:45:04] point of 160
[03:45:13] nothing
[03:45:15] time to make a decision it's a
[03:45:17] breakpoint yeah but do you know what the
[03:45:19] breakpoint is
[03:45:20] for it's not for zero
[03:45:22] cycle 120
[03:45:25] vwac I mean it doesn't matter if I go
[03:45:30] Ronald well it matters but
[03:45:33] like yeah you know what I
[03:45:37] mean Hello
[03:45:43] Razer
[03:45:51] wait why the [ __ ] am
[03:45:52] I is it because I entered with my
[03:45:54] technique why the [ __ ] my Al I wasn't
[03:45:56] paying attention free will or was it
[03:45:59] fate
[03:46:04] uh
[03:46:07] skill I we for the
[03:46:13] depart
[03:46:20] why I trying this again I'm just going
[03:46:21] to clear it I might as well clear even
[03:46:23] if it's a one
[03:46:24] cycle although this is really good
[03:46:26] damage surprisingly this is our best
[03:46:29] clear uh my skill fights are kind of low
[03:46:31] but I think it's fine we have sparkle
[03:46:32] right so we just do basic here Sparkle
[03:46:36] e and we alt we're fine find the answer
[03:46:41] oh yeah I don't have an ALT here another
[03:46:43] Journey Begins maybe cuz I held my ALT
[03:46:44] for too long

[03:50:54] the rest I'm not making a guide though
[03:50:56] so I'm not going to be in as much depth
[03:50:58] hello I hope um
[03:51:01] but coming
[03:51:08] support free will or was it fate I only
[03:51:12] got
[03:51:13] one
[03:51:15] Al last time so should I just make it
[03:51:17] count hit my pea please you please
[03:51:20] please please please please that's not
[03:51:22] pea that's not
[03:51:23] peil the
[03:51:26] answer it I only got one Al last time so
[03:51:29] I wonder if I should try to make it
[03:51:30] count and kill them with one Al but I
[03:51:32] don't think I can there's literally no
[03:51:33] way I can kill them with one Al so this
[03:51:35] has to be two cycle
[03:51:40] regardless I mean the one cycle not zero
[03:51:44] plus plus one plus one plus one that's
[03:51:46] three plus another one plus another one
[03:51:48] that's five 5 + three is eight that is
[03:51:50] not enough to Al again but we'll try

[03:57:01] me this combat needs up this is double
[03:57:08] speed I weep for the
[03:57:11] depart it so far
[03:57:25] 287 for Oblivion can I have fun for
[03:57:30] enemy targets
[03:57:33] detected I pressed four instead of three
[03:57:35] you [ __ ] idiot
[03:57:37] Z I pressed I tried to press three to Al
[03:57:40] I pressed
[03:57:43] four
[03:57:45] together as one all things in human
[03:57:53] creation
[03:57:56] again
[03:57:58] and more
[03:58:02] enemies ready for another that's half
[03:58:04] the
[03:58:09] work I don't have any ultimate ability
[03:58:12] which is upsetting with
[03:58:14] you a quick
[03:58:18] divination please hit one of my middle
[03:58:20] two never mind you're
[03:58:25] delayed I aled oh I'm so bad at the
[03:58:28] [ __ ] video game this combat needs
[03:58:32] optimizing okay I lost one stack of my
[03:58:34] Al
[03:58:36] now I we for the
[03:58:41] depart this surely kills though right
[03:58:44] okay
[03:58:45] yeah cuz I had three bonus Stacks which
[03:58:47] is good but then I got hit on uh fuen
[03:58:51] and then it Trend debuffed an enemy
[03:58:54] which I wasn't expecting cuz I wanted to
[03:58:55] Al before that but I didn't cuz I don't
[03:58:57] know
[03:58:59] why uh should I wait for the swords no
[03:59:02] actually the number would be higher
[03:59:03] which is funnier and then you guys will
[03:59:05] think the character is better even
[03:59:06] though it's just a funnier number even
[03:59:07] though it doesn't actually matter so I'm
[03:59:09] going to do that [ __ ] my energy actually
[03:59:11] a fun little known fact uh you actually
[03:59:14] let's say you all okay okay let's say
[03:59:16] let's say let's say let me show you
[03:59:17] something I didn't press that I didn't
[03:59:20] press that oh I turned Auto Battle on oh
[03:59:22] my God I didn't mean
[03:59:31] to again allow me to make a div okay
[03:59:34] okay what I was going to say is even if
[03:59:36] you have your alt available on pea
[03:59:39] sometimes you want a basic before alting
[03:59:41] even if your energy is full with acon on
[03:59:44] because if you alt and you apply
[03:59:48] resolution debuff and your alt debuff
[03:59:50] you'll only get one stack right and then
[03:59:53] your basic after won't apply this cuz
[03:59:54] it's already applied
[03:59:58] but if you alt no sorry if you basic
[04:00:02] apply this that's one stack then you alt
[04:00:04] apply this that's another stack boom
[04:00:05] plus
[04:00:07] two anyways uh I wanted to Al all these
[04:00:10] enemies it doesn't actually matter it
[04:00:12] just will make the damage number look
[04:00:13] bigger it literally doesn't matter
[04:00:15] though because these swords die to one
[04:00:17] shot from Arron's Al anyways so I don't
[04:00:19] think it it literally does nothing but
[04:00:21] it would look funny and that's important
[04:00:23] to me I for the
[04:00:37] depart yin and
[04:00:42] yang
[04:00:45] enemy Target ready for another I see
[04:00:47] through you together as one all things
[04:00:50] in the human
[04:00:54] creation more
[04:00:58] enemies
[04:01:00] evil okay this should kill him this next
[04:01:03] Al which isn't too
[04:01:08] bad coming
[04:01:11] supporty see we got death reduction
[04:01:13] that's Plus plus one stack and then this
[04:01:14] ult going to be another stock boom right
[04:01:17] free will or was it fate
[04:01:25] um all right
[04:01:28] goodbye freak you
[04:01:34] yaning not bad for a good night and
[04:01:36] sleep ball that's not
[04:01:37] bad 28 Cycles left that's [ __ ] that's
[04:01:40] nothing dude we're chilling that was
[04:01:42] good
[04:01:45] I'll show you the build I'll show you
[04:01:46] the build I'll show you the build I'll
[04:01:47] show you the build he makes acon look
[04:01:49] bad wait I literally did nothing wrong
[04:01:51] what do you I I missed one
[04:01:54] stack we're literally on a scuffed build
[04:01:57] too we're on good night and okay good
[04:01:58] night and S is not scuffed but like it's
[04:02:00] not a
[04:02:01] signature um we're on
[04:02:04] 8810 and we're on twopiece twopiece
[04:02:06] twopiece not even best in
[04:02:08] spot I usually have four piece Pioneer
[04:02:11] but my four piece Pioneer only has speed
[04:02:12] boots and without uh signature lone I
[04:02:15] don't like speed
[04:02:16] boots I
[04:02:18] like um
[04:02:21] yeah so we're on
[04:02:23] yeah
[04:02:27] yeah what's the damage increase from S5
[04:02:30] G well to Signature it is between 10 to
[04:02:32] 15 to 30% the reason why it's so hard to
[04:02:35] quantify is because realistically it'll
[04:02:38] give be like a 10 to 15% damage increase
[04:02:40] but it also gives you extra alts and if
[04:02:42] it gives you an extra Alt which it
[04:02:44] usually will and in my experience it
[04:02:46] like always does that's like 30% more
[04:02:48] damage cuz you get another alt and your
[04:02:50] alt is like 500k 600k
[04:02:53] 800k but it depends like I I've seen
[04:02:56] like some [ __ ] rotation math that's
[04:02:58] showing that in five Cycles you'll get
[04:02:59] the same amount of alts with like attack
[04:03:01] boots and speed boots well that's with
[04:03:03] signature but but it's like are you
[04:03:05] really aiming for a five cycle maybe
[04:03:07] like it dep a lot of this [ __ ] just
[04:03:09] depends
[04:03:11] um a lot of this depends but yeah it's
[04:03:14] pretty
[04:03:21] significant 23 months wow
[04:03:25] wow wait what's in the shop did I buy it
[04:03:39] out 100K
[04:03:42] [ __ ] do I even want any of
[04:03:52] these what is real wow break
[04:04:11] effect wait chat
[04:04:18] chat chat chat chat chat chat chat
[04:04:23] chat do you think do we think do we

[04:04:56] set I farmed it so much what do you want
[04:04:59] from
[04:05:00] me I didn't even sleep last

[04:05:15] if we get something good Chad you're my
[04:05:16] lucky charm if we don't you're all
[04:05:18] banned eventually this patch yeah second
[04:05:23] enough we are back in business
[04:05:30] guys all the time yeah all the
[04:05:35] time got nothing to lose sorry sorry I'm
[04:05:40] going to get kicked out from this
[04:05:40] apartment I'm
[04:05:42] sorry
[04:05:50] for this is double
[04:05:54] speed ready for
[04:06:03] another someone just messaged typed in
[04:06:06] chat said at ziox should I get jinglu or
[04:06:12] acaron
[04:06:19] creation I weit for the
[04:06:22] depart there is no winning in this
[04:06:25] war there is no answer to that
[04:06:33] question there is no answer to this
[04:06:37] question each character has their
[04:06:41] strengths only one of the two character
[04:06:43] has weaknesses sorry that's not true uh
[04:06:48] the each character has their strengths
[04:06:49] uh I said you is easier to build around
[04:06:52] um but acon has really high highs has
[04:06:55] good like vertical investment lyone E2
[04:06:58] so it really depends a lot of burst it
[04:07:00] depends I think they're both very strong
[04:07:03] um for overall Andy I'm leaning
[04:07:11] towards for good old counter overall
[04:07:14] Andy who's not a whale no good for
[04:07:17] especially if you don't have like an
[04:07:18] amaz if you're not pulling for Signature
[04:07:19] and stuff I would lean towards jinglu
[04:07:22] and then if you're like really looking
[04:07:23] to spam invest into a character then I
[04:07:25] would lean towards acaron I think
[04:07:27] Aaron's very strong I think they're both
[04:07:28] very
[04:07:32] strong
[04:07:35] okay for
[04:07:37] Oblivion do Taco better than lightning
[04:07:39] yes but very slightly so go based on sub
[04:07:41] stats uh new planner set or salotto new
[04:07:44] planner but Salo is also very good again
[04:07:45] go based on sub stats very similar very
[04:07:49] similar but new set like yeah if you
[04:07:53] think about it
[04:07:55] right oh Lady Snow
[04:08:00] blood
[04:08:08] yeah 3% differ between Sal soda and eumo
[04:08:11] yeah it's literally not that's like
[04:08:12] basically nothing like that's that's
[04:08:14] less relevant than just going sub stats
[04:08:16] right it's like one two sub stats well H
[04:08:20] yeah one crit damage of that is
[04:08:27] like [ __ ] it one more
[04:08:38] run

[04:11:02] review video because I didn't want I
[04:11:05] didn't want people to
[04:11:07] think cuz it was like an early video I
[04:11:09] don't want people to think that they
[04:11:11] needed a character and that I was not
[04:11:13] addressing the like drawbacks but for a
[04:11:16] guide it doesn't matter as much well it
[04:11:17] matters but it's not like you know

[04:12:33] different attacks which have no ICD can
[04:12:34] Vape every hit unfortunately though even
[04:12:37] so they don't do that much damage and so
[04:12:38] they're not that important in his play
[04:12:40] style his bur deals a huge AOE damage
[04:12:42] and can be as crowd control
[04:12:44] enies they can easily be stag and thrown
[04:12:46] away by the
[04:12:52] Phoenix

[04:14:30] lighting is just
[04:14:35] [ __ ] oh it's
[04:14:39] blurry let me restart
[04:14:42] it
[04:14:44] uh where the [ __ ] my
[04:14:50] account wait where even is my cam oh
[04:14:52] video capture device properties
[04:14:56] deactivate
[04:15:03] activate this is double
[04:15:11] speed
[04:15:13] when using Tren fwen I put her in the
[04:15:15] middle of the
[04:15:16] teamart wait
[04:15:19] why usually you want your character that
[04:15:21] has high aggro or taunt or whatever like
[04:15:25] japar for
[04:15:26] AOE wait but don't you want to oh yes
[04:15:29] yeah you should yeah you should you
[04:15:30] should you should I thought you were
[04:15:31] talking about yeah yeah yeah well not
[04:15:33] middle like third but not H I mean I
[04:15:37] guess it depends cuz do you want to die
[04:15:39] more often I mean you probably should
[04:15:41] yeah probably next to
[04:15:44] um probably next to characters that are
[04:15:48] not your
[04:15:50] squishiest yeah I guess I guess
[04:15:56] three I don't think it I mean the
[04:15:59] disadvantage is you might die like you
[04:16:01] might your your random ass character
[04:16:03] might die if you're taunting like if if
[04:16:05] if your japar who has high aggro or F
[04:16:09] whatever is like in the middle of two of
[04:16:11] your supports is a higher likelihood
[04:16:12] that they die versus if she's on the
[04:16:14] edge but you might get more Trend procs
[04:16:16] it's probably worth it maon good also
[04:16:19] who is the best Aaron or if you're
[04:16:22] running attack boots is it fine to have
[04:16:24] garbage speed uh I think you should
[04:16:26] decide if you want garbage speed or fast
[04:16:27] speed before choosing your
[04:16:29] boots cuz you can have fast speed with
[04:16:31] attack boots but you lose so much crit
[04:16:33] that way like you would usually rather
[04:16:35] lose attack than lose crit does that
[04:16:37] make sense so going for a main stat
[04:16:41] speed lets you go crit sub stats but
[04:16:43] going for substat speed doesn't let you
[04:16:45] go for crit main stat cuz there's no
[04:16:47] crit boost
[04:16:50] as usually with Aron um attack is
[04:16:56] fine but if you have her Lyon I like
[04:16:58] speed well not even more than attack but
[04:17:00] I like I like attack more than Speed
[04:17:02] without her lyone and with her lyone I
[04:17:05] like speed about as much as attack it
[04:17:07] just depends for me it's better because
[04:17:10] I get um extra Alt
[04:17:13] but if you don't then attack is
[04:17:20] better and if you play Sparkle or bronia
[04:17:22] then zero is
[04:17:25] fine attack better at ezero generally
[04:17:27] attack is better at
[04:17:28] szo no signature S1 it's like similar I
[04:17:33] think most people will say attack is
[04:17:35] better and I think for a lot of people
[04:17:36] it will be but if going more often gives
[04:17:39] you more ult casts and it gives you more
[04:17:41] toughness damage which can be relevant
[04:17:44] like you could break more right then it
[04:17:46] will be uh uh it could be
[04:17:53] better and awaken p is better if you run
[04:17:57] Sparkle bronia yes but you're usually
[04:17:58] only running Sparkle BR if you're E2 or
[04:18:01] if you're doing some like weth sustain
[04:18:04] stuff which I like I've done that I
[04:18:07] shill
[04:18:09] It Aron e
[04:18:11] zero
[04:18:14] ready for
[04:18:15] another time for a good old
[04:18:20] counter human
[04:18:27] creation silver signature is pretty good
[04:18:30] on her uh
[04:18:33] EXO her signature is still better but
[04:18:35] it's not like I think it's maybe like is
[04:18:38] it 20% I don't know I have lone rankings
[04:18:41] I just don't kind of forget ah the
[04:18:44] difference between silver wolfes I can
[04:18:46] pull it
[04:18:57] up oh yeah also black SW e1's pretty
[04:18:59] cracked if you have
[04:19:11] it yeah it's like 15 to 20%
[04:19:18] better I mean that is quite a bit
[04:19:20] actually
[04:19:22] know her signature is just [ __ ]
[04:19:24] broken I don't know what to say it's
[04:19:25] it's just
[04:19:27] stupid why do I have zero and
[04:19:31] seven is Acorn worth
[04:19:36] wait that's kind of goated

[04:26:01] on my main account I one cycled but on
[04:26:03] uh uh Med server with relics that are
[04:26:06] just slightly better ezero I I zero
[04:26:09] cycle you want to know the hidden Tech
[04:26:12] you'll get it like instantly you have
[04:26:13] you have sparkle right yeah yeah yeah
[04:26:16] okay hear me out acaron right mhm and
[04:26:20] then you want Sparkle and you want two
[04:26:22] Niles so you're like okay well what's
[04:26:23] the best nil in the game Sil uh Pila not
[04:26:26] even close Okay Y what the silver wolf
[04:26:29] yeah I almost said silver wolf uh but
[04:26:31] she we don't talk about silver wolf okay
[04:26:33] so peila okay and then P's on a
[04:26:36] resolution right to reduce defense wait
[04:26:38] why do you say paila cuz it's funny it's
[04:26:41] fun peila I I thought you I thought you
[04:26:43] were like 101 you actually thought
[04:26:45] that's how you say it well I did but I
[04:26:47] never like fixed it oh dude people say
[04:26:51] it's Zilla no way cely isn't cely yeah I
[04:26:54] always say cely all right anyways um
[04:26:58] okay okay so you have paila you have uh
[04:27:01] uh then you could probably do okay then
[04:27:03] your two slots are empty so what if you
[04:27:05] have sparkle on like whatever 135 speed
[04:27:07] or 160 mine's on 160 and then you can go
[04:27:10] more often right you get two stacks for
[04:27:12] cuz you have your signature and you're
[04:27:13] just a beast okay cool you're also E2 so
[04:27:16] you don't even need you're E6 right so
[04:27:17] you don't even need e z s S1 right now
[04:27:21] oh I see I see I see okay okay well yeah
[04:27:23] so then you would need another Hil now
[04:27:25] hear me out you don't have wealth built
[04:27:27] but what if I told you you could have a
[04:27:30] character who would need basically just
[04:27:32] a bit of speed and no relics silver
[04:27:35] wolves tutorial likeone which you have
[04:27:37] for free maybe a little energy no damage
[04:27:40] no Relic set no Idol
[04:27:43] on and whose name rhymed with
[04:27:48] Pelt that's welt yeah but you don't need
[04:27:51] to build him you just put him there he
[04:27:52] like slows Debs boom GG he does no
[04:27:55] damage he just he just he's just there
[04:27:58] fast so what Pella
[04:28:00] welt yeah I was think Pella wel Sparkle
[04:28:03] and then your Spar so paila will go
[04:28:05] first boom debuff everything then weth
[04:28:07] will delay their action Sparkle will
[04:28:09] make your Aron go instantly
[04:28:11] boom
[04:28:13] yeah but see the issue is I'm
[04:28:15] restricting myself from using Sparkle
[04:28:17] because my Sparkle is E6 and that kind
[04:28:20] of just makes everything you could do
[04:28:21] Ron may I
[04:28:22] think should be able to but I would go
[04:28:25] 135 uh 134 sorry uh acon if you do
[04:28:29] that
[04:28:30] yeah that's the other issue my I have

[05:08:47] to upload my acon guide um
[05:08:51] Acorn I might do a random genin stream
[05:08:54] but outside of that I'm going to be
[05:08:55] traveling for the next few days I will
[05:08:57] do a stream within two or three either
[05:08:59] in two days as normal or three I'll do
[05:09:02] another gen stream or Star rail I don't
[05:09:03] know and then
[05:09:06] also there's something I have to stream
[05:09:09] for but I can't tell you guys what it
[05:09:11] is so you'll see um but it's G to be
[05:09:16] hype
[05:09:18] um however so expect a few streams this
[05:09:21] week but it's going to be like on the
[05:09:22] move and I'll be back home in like five
[05:09:23] days uh elen ring will happen but that's
[05:09:26] not what I'm that's not what I'm ref
[05:09:30] soon
[05:09:31] uh story Quest when that's a good
[05:09:34] question I want to [ __ ] the last one
[05:09:35] was good so I want to do it
[05:09:37] probably I'm not going to give you a
[05:09:38] date but
[05:09:46] Z okay spoilers the only thing for the
[05:09:49] Delo guy I haven't recorded yet is the
[05:09:51] team
[05:09:53] section dude I saw this one
[05:09:55] dude there's this one guy who makes the
[05:09:58] Luke videos who like speedruns
[05:10:00] everything with melt the Luke this guy's
[05:10:01] a [ __ ] Chad by the way shout out to I
[05:10:03] don't know their name but shout out to
[05:10:04] them
[05:10:05] but I was thinking about it and like I
[05:10:08] played the I've played the team a
[05:10:12] bit I feel like it's
[05:10:16] like I don't know how much I want to
[05:10:19] talk about it cuz I think it's very fun
[05:10:21] but I think if you don't have like C6
[05:10:23] Kaaya or like some upgrades it kind of
[05:10:25] gets a little Annoying to
[05:10:28] play um cuz dude like I played it and
[05:10:32] like I I can show
[05:10:38] you
[05:10:42] so I watched I was like okay this team
[05:10:44] com that this guy's playing looks good
[05:10:46] so sh I mean I should probably shout
[05:10:48] them out properly cuz uh that was the
[05:10:50] inspiration I mean I knew about the team
[05:10:51] for like a year but I I like saw their
[05:10:54] videos so I'll link it in chat this
[05:10:57] person person I was pretty F I'll I'll
[05:11:01] I'll link it but anyways uh and the only
[05:11:05] problem I have is like my K C6 so like
[05:11:07] it helps but
[05:11:10] right after I kill this
[05:11:13] thing right like I I melt everything I
[05:11:15] melt everything right well that okay at
[05:11:18] the end it reverse melts but I could
[05:11:20] time my Autos better sure but like what
[05:11:22] I noticed when doing the abyss with this
[05:11:23] team is like Kazo swirl is done right
[05:11:26] now and like my ALT has a 6C cooldown
[05:11:30] still so I feel like once kaz's burst
[05:11:33] expires it's kind of like I don't
[05:11:36] know like it's good for like speed
[05:11:38] clearing but I don't know if I would
[05:11:40] recommend it like outside of really high
[05:11:42] investment cuz I feel like the uptime is
[05:11:45] kind of [ __ ] after like you cryo swirl
[05:11:47] and then you do all this setup and then
[05:11:49] it's like almost gone so I don't know I
[05:11:53] don't know something to consider
[05:11:57] but
[05:11:59] yeah I like the finina teams with him
[05:12:03] though um which are pretty POG but
[05:12:07] anyways it's a short rotation 15 seconds
[05:12:10] yeah but like I mean yeah it is but it's
[05:12:15] like it's literally okay it's Ka e then
[05:12:18] swap to Kaza then Q then swap to Bennett
[05:12:20] then Q E then swap to Kaza hold e then
[05:12:22] swap to duuke no then swap to Kaa again
[05:12:26] then Q then swap to duuke then q and
[05:12:29] then you Auto for like one second like
[05:12:31] two you're like Auto e melt your other E
[05:12:35] Auto e and that's
[05:12:38] it um um how you battery him I mean you
[05:12:41] can doesn't need that much ER like if
[05:12:43] you burst then e three times and then
[05:12:45] you go to Bennett you press your e all
[05:12:46] that you should be
[05:12:50] fine Rosaria diona instead of Kaa diona
[05:12:54] is good for melt damage but I don't
[05:12:57] think it's a better team
[05:13:01] comp wait do you mean no kazua then you
[05:13:03] don't s Al
[05:13:08] Pyro
[05:13:12] unless you me no Bennett I don't
[05:13:14] know
[05:13:19] anyways anyways chat I'm gonna end I'll
[05:13:22] figure that out um yeah no I mean look
[05:13:24] it is a fun team um and the non shenu
[05:13:28] stuff is just like SRO yolon
[05:13:32] finina and like I think buron is
[05:13:35] unironically fine maybe next stream we
[05:13:38] test some the Luke virgin stuff like
[05:13:40] okay it's kind of copium the way I play
[05:13:42] it retro buron but it sounds funny and I
[05:13:45] think you could do finina Nita I think
[05:13:47] you could do duuke finina
[05:13:53] Nita I don't know maybe that's copium or
[05:13:56] like duuke Shen I don't know duuke
[05:13:58] finina Shen
[05:14:08] Yun
[05:14:15] I'll figure it out all right thanks for
[05:14:17] watching chat
[05:14:19] um was a fun
[05:14:29] stream [ __ ] it I'm just going to end
[05:14:31] because I might go live again
[05:14:38] later
[05:14:54] I mean we could raate
[05:15:07] someone
[05:15:18] for
