[00:13:13] fashion to healing or healers like
[00:13:15] Bennett uh he should be the best support
[00:13:17] for any character provided they scale on

[00:13:21] benefit from a pyro support like a
[00:13:22] battery or attack buffer now we don't

[00:14:02] it like two years ago at like the Eden
[00:14:04] Center I just like walked in I I was
[00:14:06] with I was with I was at seir the guy
[00:14:08] that makes thumbnails for us and I we

[00:14:11] hoodie looks cool I bought it I didn't
[00:14:12] look at the [ __ ] price I checked
[00:14:13] after it was like 80 got [ __ ] scammed
[00:14:15] it's fine actually I don't know how much

[00:14:18] 80
[00:14:20] whatever welcome to the
[00:14:24] stream average clothing price I mean I
[00:14:26] guess I don't know dude I don't [ __ ]
[00:14:28] go out

[00:14:31] doing
[00:14:34] well it's comfy though it's actually not
[00:14:36] that bad I think I just I think I just
[00:14:39] think that it was like super overpriced
[00:14:40] cuz also like I feel like everything in
[00:14:42] that store like dude the socks were like
[00:14:44] 20 bucks for like a few pairs of white
[00:14:46] socks I was like I I don't know that's
[00:14:48] the only thing I bought but whatever uh
[00:14:51] it's fine welcome to the stream hope
[00:14:54] you're doing well 80 is good if it's
[00:14:56] caught in I don't know it feels good
[00:14:58] like it feels nice I think it's it's
[00:14:59] probably good it it feels good quality
[00:15:01] so I don't mind like certain things if
[00:15:03] it's good quality it's going to last me
[00:15:04] a long time I don't mind paying a bit
[00:15:06] more but like that one felt like a scam
[00:15:07] but I've been wearing it for like two
[00:15:08] years so I I guess it's I guess it paid
[00:15:11] itself off um

[00:25:57] lady perfume but
[00:26:02] chemically
[00:26:05] anyways anyway I think I'll just put it
[00:26:07] in the wash throw it in rice dude why

[00:26:27] Yen anytime time we mentioned Yen like
[00:26:29] 20 resident Yen Ms pop out of chat for
[00:26:32] some reason everyone who madees yen is
[00:26:33] just lurking in my chat at all times it
[00:26:35] actually doesn't make sense I don't even
[00:26:37] know how all five of you are there I
[00:26:38] didn't mean to guess of another pyro I
[00:26:40] meant to guess uh jaia but he's uh
[00:26:44] that's diligence not prosperity and Shia
[00:26:45] is prosperity who's a diligence uh pole
[00:26:47] arm from Liu it is um diligence pole arm

[00:35:00] oh I saw
[00:35:01] this Zio making fun of me making fun of
[00:35:06] spelling by a non-native English speaker
[00:35:09] me 2024
[00:35:11] colorized yeah and I'll [ __ ] do it
[00:35:13] again you misspelled English the start
[00:35:15] of your sentence doesn't make sense and
[00:35:16] you wrote colorized in a non-american
[00:35:18] way which I respect I actually like the
[00:35:20] OU instead of just the O but
[00:35:23] still a guide he has too much skill
[00:35:25] issue You misspelled much you can't
[00:35:29] you can't say I have skill issue when
[00:35:31] you spell much with a [ __ ] T Zach
[00:35:33] isn't capable of producing such a guide
[00:35:35] he's get it honestly deserved I I double
[00:35:38] down on that if I had an account I would
[00:35:40] upload that I combined all the true
[00:35:41] stories into one big not reading that
[00:35:44] moan compilation goes
[00:35:47] harder I [ __ ] had this exact phone
[00:35:50] growing
[00:35:53] up I don't hear
[00:35:56] it
[00:36:00] when I was born the devil said what the
[00:36:03] hell oh my God no way dude what dude
[00:36:07] what are you guys
[00:36:13] doing
[00:36:15] true okay who cut this out this isn't a
[00:36:19] real
[00:36:21] picture
[00:36:24] are dude what is this
[00:36:34] I am not LeBron James why doesn't he
[00:36:37] make a japar or claride [ __ ] you I would
[00:36:39] if I had them oh that's cute okay [ __ ]
[00:36:43] you never mind I take that back I'm
[00:36:45] going to I'm going to cry all I asked
[00:36:47] for is one stream but no I'm not reading
[00:36:51] all that mad pad stun locked
[00:36:54] what than the surface of the Sun so what
[00:36:57] happens when you heat water really
[00:36:58] quickly in an enclosed space well it
[00:37:00] turns into a gas and expands it needs a
[00:37:02] place to go in a hurry in an instant the
[00:37:04] pressure inside the tree builds until
[00:37:06] finally the gas pushes so hard that the
[00:37:08] bark can't handle it
[00:37:10] anymore literally explode wood and
[00:37:13] splinters are sent flying everywhere as
[00:37:15] if we didn't need more reasons to stay
[00:37:17] indoors playing video games now these
[00:37:18] splinters aren't exactly homing missiles
[00:37:20] but it does show that tree plus water
[00:37:22] plus electricity does result in flying
[00:37:25] plant projectiles that can do some
[00:37:26] serious
[00:37:30] why did tree water electricity make me
[00:37:32] laugh yo I'm [ __ ] water plus
[00:37:35] electricity
[00:37:38] does dude no way they made hyper blo
[00:37:40] into a real thing result in flying plant
[00:37:43] projectiles that can do some serious
[00:37:45] damage on impact on genin impct wait is
[00:37:49] this wait what the [ __ ] wait is this
[00:37:51] actually
[00:37:52] sponsored wait is that
[00:37:56] real
[00:37:59] impact plus electricity does result in
[00:38:01] flying plant projectiles that can do
[00:38:04] damage on impact is this new or
[00:38:08] old let me look this
[00:38:10] up you are my son
[00:38:17] shine oh no this is old this is 2022
[00:38:20] 2023 the deadly plants of genin impact
[00:38:23] thanks to genin impact for sponsoring
[00:38:25] today's episode
[00:38:28] oh yeah it's right here I
[00:38:30] see roots that can't be true in real
[00:38:33] life right if electricity truly made
[00:38:35] plants stronger and more fruitful why
[00:38:38] haven't we heard of it before how am I
[00:38:39] able to go apple picking wouldn't every
[00:38:42] farmer ever just electrocute their
[00:38:43] Orchard to try and max out their
[00:38:45] harvests well when you start to look
[00:38:47] into it there's actually a lot more here
[00:38:49] than meets the eye loyal theorists allow
[00:38:51] me to introduce you to the new world of
[00:38:53] an old science electr horiculture this
[00:38:56] is an old study but what way back in
[00:38:58] 1746 a research wait what the [ __ ] I
[00:39:00] just saw Nita and Y which at first might
[00:39:03] seem obvious combining two attacks
[00:39:04] equals one stronger attack but it also
[00:39:06] produces a Quicken effect wait this is
[00:39:08] fire do you guys want to watch
[00:39:11] this I kind of want to watch this dude I
[00:39:15] want to learn Elemental gauge Theory
[00:39:17] from Matt Pat [ __ ] it imp for sponsoring
[00:39:20] surface of the Sun so what happens when
[00:39:22] you heat water really
[00:39:24] quickly [ __ ] it I'm watching this yo if
[00:39:27] I see a uid in this video so help me God
[00:39:30] if I'm not reviewing it I reviewed Dar
[00:39:32] and then Matt Pat GG all right class
[00:39:34] your assignment to demonstrate reactions
[00:39:36] incorporating the tree based element of
[00:39:38] dendro Talia I see you're using your
[00:39:40] hydro Powers very good there CAU yours
[00:39:43] is I'm going to mute alerts for this but
[00:39:44] thank you so much for 11 mon there it's
[00:39:46] a reaction how you getting along show
[00:39:50] them sorry ey but you'll find that wood
[00:39:52] isn't a very effective conductor of
[00:39:53] electricity I'm going to have to lower
[00:39:55] your score emerge oh that's kind of okay
[00:39:58] they got the voice line I would used
[00:40:00] ficial
[00:40:06] but wait how's the volume hello Internet
[00:40:09] welcome to Game Theory the show that
[00:40:11] loves its wuss but not as
[00:40:13] much okay yo not to be that guy but
[00:40:16] every time someone says waifu a baby
[00:40:19] kitten dies I'm sorry it literally like
[00:40:21] hurts my core I can't I actually can't
[00:40:25] literally like it just hurts talk about
[00:40:27] today thanks to our sponsor genin impact
[00:40:30] the game has just released their fourth
[00:40:31] country update in it you'll be exploring
[00:40:33] the new region their fourth
[00:40:35] country from the Lush rainfor brother
[00:40:39] new full of underground ruins and buried
[00:40:42] lore the main story Quest focuses on
[00:40:45] several characters start to realize that
[00:40:46] they've been reliving the same day over
[00:40:48] and over again which itself has some
[00:40:50] fascinating scientific implications but
[00:40:52] that's not what I want to focus on today
[00:40:54] you see each new party member inchin
[00:40:56] impact is associated with one of seven
[00:40:57] different elements Hydro pyro cryo
[00:41:00] Electro Geo and ano but at the start of
[00:41:03] this new story line we're introduced to
[00:41:05] an archon of a brand new element known
[00:41:07] as dendro which comes from the Greek
[00:41:09] dendron meaning tree now I didn't know
[00:41:12] that dendron see plus one knowledge now
[00:41:15] now I can I can say dendron here than
[00:41:17] just Vine whipping and razor leaves
[00:41:19] combat Eng impact is based on creating
[00:41:21] Elemental reactions by combining
[00:41:23] different elements most do what you'd
[00:41:25] expect combine hydro and cryo what is a
[00:41:27] gift chat oh [ __ ] your a free combine
[00:41:30] cryo and Pyro what do you get forward
[00:41:34] melt and you get I mean reverse melt I'm
[00:41:36] [ __ ] wow I'm stupider than [ __ ]
[00:41:39] I'm actually worse than this video it's
[00:41:42] reverse melt my bad I was I was I just
[00:41:44] made it okay I was talking about duuke
[00:41:46] melting and I said forward melt so I'm
[00:41:49] reaction reverse my bad new dendro
[00:41:52] Powers things start to get a little bit
[00:41:53] more unexpected sure combining D they
[00:41:55] had the cryo first that was forward true
[00:41:58] actually with pyro causes burning and
[00:42:01] combining dendro causes the grow of SE
[00:42:05] out of the ordinary there but what
[00:42:06] really captured my curiosity was when I
[00:42:08] started mixing plants with electricity
[00:42:11] now I'm sure we all remember second
[00:42:12] grade science class where we learned
[00:42:14] that wood isn't the best conductor of
[00:42:15] electricity I don't remember that seem
[00:42:17] to be that my use y Miko's Electro
[00:42:20] attacks with n's dend ones your attacks
[00:42:23] okay but like I'm not dumb I knew I
[00:42:24] wanted to be like a lawyer so it went
[00:42:27] science class like I still had good
[00:42:28] grades but like I like threw it out of
[00:42:30] my memory after like I didn't do bad I
[00:42:32] did good but like I don't remember [ __ ]
[00:42:35] like I I like who cares dude I took
[00:42:37] Advanced maths in like my last high
[00:42:39] school year and I was like I don't need
[00:42:40] to know this ever but I'm doing it cuz
[00:42:43] all my friends are doing it dude all my
[00:42:44] friends were like [ __ ] math dude they
[00:42:46] were all I don't know whatever combining
[00:42:49] two attacks equals one stronger attack
[00:42:51] but it also produces a Quicken effect
[00:42:53] and no I'm not talking about personal
[00:42:54] finance software here this is a base
[00:42:56] effect which increases the damage of
[00:42:58] your next Electro or dendro attack
[00:43:00] creating either aggravate or spread
[00:43:02] respectively now that alone was
[00:43:04] unexpected but even more interesting was
[00:43:06] when you mixed three elements dendro
[00:43:08] plus Hydro equals Bloom but mixing an
[00:43:11] electro as the third ingredient creates
[00:43:12] an elemental cocktail known as Hyper
[00:43:14] Bloom turning the seeds into guided
[00:43:17] missiles that seek out the nearest enemy
[00:43:19] I don't betteri got you are not getting
[00:43:22] seeds to LEAP up into the air to become
[00:43:23] guided missiles right right well I was
[00:43:26] curious about these reactions and
[00:43:27] whether or not they were based in some
[00:43:29] form of reality so I did a bit of
[00:43:30] digging only to find that there's way
[00:43:32] more to the relationship between plants
[00:43:34] and electricity than our school science
[00:43:36] classes would have us believe so stick
[00:43:38] with me theorists because I got a
[00:43:40] feeling that today's theory is really
[00:43:41] going to grow on you outside strapping
[00:43:44] some J cables onto my Fus where can I
[00:43:46] see the effects of electricity on Plants
[00:43:48] well one of the most common occurrences
[00:43:49] are during lightning storms lightning
[00:43:51] occurs when particles inside a cloud
[00:43:53] collide with each other knocking
[00:43:54] electrons free which then attach to
[00:43:56] other particles the particles that lose
[00:43:58] their electrons now have a slight
[00:44:00] positive charge thus they go to the top
[00:44:02] of the cloud the ones that gain
[00:44:04] electrons are now heavier and have a
[00:44:06] slightly more negative charge causing
[00:44:08] them to go to the bottom of the cloud
[00:44:09] those slightly negative particles also
[00:44:11] now need a way to equalize so when the
[00:44:13] positive and negative charges grow large
[00:44:15] enough that's when you get lightning
[00:44:17] it's the discharge as everything
[00:44:18] equalizes the ground is also positively
[00:44:21] charged which is why lightning is
[00:44:23] sometimes able to jump downwards towards
[00:44:25] Earth but here's where things start to
[00:44:26] get interesting you see air isn't a very
[00:44:29] good conductor and lightning wants to
[00:44:30] take the path of least resistance that's
[00:44:32] why it'll strike a lightning rod or a
[00:44:34] tall building they're the fastest path
[00:44:35] to a positive charge or me CU I'm pretty
[00:44:37] tall materials metal and while trees
[00:44:39] aren't exactly the most conductive they
[00:44:41] are tall so they immediately become a
[00:44:43] much more attractive option than just
[00:44:45] traveling through plain old air and the
[00:44:47] relationship between trees and lightning
[00:44:48] doesn't just stop there trees are made
[00:44:50] up of roughly 50% water with a lot of
[00:44:53] that moisture contained just below the
[00:44:54] bark meanwhile a single bolt of
[00:44:56] lightning can just generate temperatures
[00:44:57] of about
[00:44:58] 54,000 de F nearly 30,000 de C believe
[00:45:03] it or not that's about 6 times hotter
[00:45:05] than the surface of the Sun and so what
[00:45:07] happens when you heat water really
[00:45:09] quickly close space well it turns into
[00:45:11] and expands it needs a place to go in a
[00:45:14] hurry in an instant the pressure inside
[00:45:15] the tree builds until finally the gas
[00:45:17] pushes so hard that the bark can't
[00:45:19] handle it anymore causing the tree to
[00:45:21] literally explode wood and splinters are
[00:45:24] sent flying everywhere as if we didn't
[00:45:26] need more reason to stay indoors playing
[00:45:28] video games now these splinters aren't
[00:45:30] exactly homing missiles but it does show
[00:45:31] that tree plus water plus electricity
[00:45:34] does result in flying plant projectiles
[00:45:36] that can do some serious damage on
[00:45:39] impact so you're telling me Matt Pat
[00:45:42] made a video explaining why hyper Bloom
[00:45:45] is broken and people still call it
[00:45:47] overrated plus water plus electricity
[00:45:49] people still he made a whole video
[00:45:52] result in flying plant projectiles that
[00:45:54] can do some serious damage on impact
[00:45:58] we just learned why it's good isn't
[00:46:00] filled with water in the game if you
[00:46:01] combine dendro and Electro one of the
[00:46:03] effects that you get is that's not the
[00:46:05] effect you get if you play Lisa and Cole
[00:46:07] you get [ __ ] depression please please
[00:46:10] change your team I'm sorry this is not
[00:46:13] what you're going to get you get is
[00:46:14] aggravate which boosts the power of your
[00:46:16] next Electro attack and that seems kind
[00:46:18] of weird right why would running
[00:46:20] electricity through a dry plant make
[00:46:22] your next electrical Attack stronger
[00:46:24] shouldn't have any impact right or maybe
[00:46:26] even a negative impact wrong this
[00:46:28] actually lines up with real world
[00:46:30] science in a 2004 Ukrainian study
[00:46:32] scientists tested the electrical
[00:46:34] resistance Leaf
[00:46:36] as never mind I thought it said Petra
[00:46:38] mind slowly dried up now you would think
[00:46:40] that as the leaf dries up and slowly
[00:46:42] dies that it's electrical resistance
[00:46:43] would increase less water left in the
[00:46:45] leaf would mean less
[00:46:47] ability flow right but no the drier the
[00:46:50] leaf Petra is a good I'm sorry dude
[00:46:53] Petra is actually good Petra is the only
[00:46:55] set that no one uses actually is good
[00:46:58] I'm sorry if Gio wasn't [ __ ] you would
[00:47:00] see was able to flow through the parts
[00:47:02] of the leaf that were still living the
[00:47:04] researchers weren't exactly sure why but
[00:47:06] they assumed that it might have to do
[00:47:07] with a stronger concentration of water
[00:47:09] and salts in the tissue that was left
[00:47:11] remaining allowing for greater
[00:47:13] electrical conductivity but regardless
[00:47:15] of the reason it yet again proves genin
[00:47:17] right in its scientific principles the
[00:47:19] first shot of electricity through a
[00:47:20] plant is basically Paving the way for
[00:47:22] subsequent shocks to be stronger and
[00:47:24] more effective So currently the
[00:47:26] scoreboard is two for two which means
[00:47:28] it's time to look at the final Elemental
[00:47:29] reaction spread to see if genin can run
[00:47:32] the perfect
[00:47:33] game is the opposite of aggravate
[00:47:35] basically okay kachita that's a good
[00:47:37] team mixed with dendro to make your next
[00:47:39] dendro attack more powerful the game
[00:47:41] even gives us an in Universe explanation
[00:47:43] for this relationship we meet a child
[00:47:45] who
[00:47:46] tells bro nobody's reading this
[00:47:50] dialogue us that quote Electro is good
[00:47:53] it makes plants stronger and bear more
[00:47:55] fruit nobody knew that real life right
[00:47:58] Lord Skipper I don't skip dude I made
[00:48:01] plants stronger and more fruitful why
[00:48:03] haven't we heard of it before how am I
[00:48:05] able to go apple picking wouldn't every
[00:48:07] farmer ever just electrocute their
[00:48:09] Orchard to try and max out their
[00:48:11] harvests well when you start to look
[00:48:12] into it there's actually a lot more here
[00:48:14] than meets the eye loyal theorists allow
[00:48:16] me to introduce you to the new world of
[00:48:18] an old science electr horiculture this
[00:48:21] is an old study but way back in 1746 a
[00:48:24] researcher named Dr Von miam fromed SC
[00:48:28] took two mytle trees and ran an
[00:48:30] electrical current through one of them
[00:48:32] and he found that the one that he ran
[00:48:33] the electrical current to grew taller uh
[00:48:36] at a faster rate without needing as much
[00:48:39] sunlight as the second plant it would
[00:48:41] cause it to grow differently now there
[00:48:43] aren't many details available about his
[00:48:45] exact experiment but from what I could
[00:48:46] gather he used an electrostatic
[00:48:48] generator to pass a current directly
[00:48:50] through the tree and back down to the
[00:48:51] ground and because static electricity
[00:48:53] runs at a much lower amperage than a
[00:48:55] lightning bolt there was no risk of
[00:48:56] accidental Splinter missiles instead
[00:48:59] after an entire month of being Zapped
[00:49:01] the tree appeared to have grown taller
[00:49:03] and had more Leaf growth than its
[00:49:05] non-electrical yes sir this was a huge
[00:49:08] Discovery and could be a great
[00:49:09] justification for genin's claims that
[00:49:11] adding Electro to dendro gives you more
[00:49:12] powerful dendr but again if this was
[00:49:14] true why aren't gardeners the world over
[00:49:16] putting power grids through their fields
[00:49:18] to be honest his conclusions were kind
[00:49:20] of hard to replicate naturally other
[00:49:22] scientists saw these crazy findings and
[00:49:24] conducted similar experiments but they
[00:49:25] wound up with mixed results at best some
[00:49:28] claimed that they got the exact same
[00:49:29] results others saw no difference and
[00:49:31] even more said that their trees outright
[00:49:33] died due to the electric flow but if you
[00:49:35] think a few failed ferns were going to
[00:49:37] stop science then clearly you haven't
[00:49:39] been watching my videos in which case
[00:49:40] you should probably just hit the
[00:49:41] Subscribe button so you can be on top of
[00:49:43] all the coolest scientific Revelations
[00:49:45] as they relate to Modern gen open world
[00:49:47] video games it is a very specific Niche
[00:49:49] but we are good at it anyway at the very
[00:49:51] start of 2022 scientists decided to take
[00:49:54] this very old study in a very new
[00:49:57] subscribe I am subscribed I just not on
[00:49:58] my actual YouTube account oh I am see
[00:50:00] I'm subbed from the Chinese Academy of
[00:50:03] Sciences in Beijing attempted to prove
[00:50:05] that electricity AIDS the growth of
[00:50:07] plants but rather than electrifying the
[00:50:08] plant itself with static electricity
[00:50:11] decided to instead put the plant inside
[00:50:13] of an electric field basically they
[00:50:15] placed the seeds on a metal plate that
[00:50:16] was connected directly to a negative
[00:50:18] electric this where the seeds were
[00:50:20] growing was a metal plate connected to a
[00:50:22] positive I just wanted to make a hyper
[00:50:23] Bloom joke and now I'm learning about
[00:50:25] electricity because it's come together
[00:50:28] you mean pyro of germination seed growth
[00:50:31] inside the electric field was 40% higher
[00:50:34] than the control group when it came to
[00:50:35] seedling growth the electri field
[00:50:37] resulted in a growth increase of 15% all
[00:50:40] in all the plants inside the electri
[00:50:42] field gave a crop yield that was 20%
[00:50:44] higher than the control group seems
[00:50:46] bizarre right like why would being in
[00:50:48] the presence of electricity change plant
[00:50:50] growth so dramatically unfortunately the
[00:50:52] research paper doesn't provide an
[00:50:54] explanation but you know what I think I
[00:50:56] can science has shown that thunderstorms
[00:50:58] tend to help with plant growth not just
[00:51:00] because of increased rainfall but also
[00:51:02] because their electrical energy helps
[00:51:04] separate the nitrogen atoms that are
[00:51:06] floating around in the air these atoms
[00:51:08] then fall to the ground where they're
[00:51:09] absorbed by the soil and eventually wind
[00:51:11] up inside a plant's Roots the University
[00:51:13] of Melbourne though has a different
[00:51:14] solution maybe electric Fields act kind
[00:51:16] of like natural pesticides the
[00:51:18] electricity doesn't bother the plant but
[00:51:20] it might scare away insects acting kind
[00:51:22] of like a low-level bug zapper there's
[00:51:24] also the fact that within an electrical
[00:51:26] field water tends to have lower surface
[00:51:28] tension resulting in Faster evaporation
[00:51:30] after rainfall or watering lastly it
[00:51:32] might just be what electricity does to
[00:51:34] the plant itself effectively boosting
[00:51:36] the metabolism of the plant by
[00:51:37] accelerating the transportation of
[00:51:38] nutrients like calcium and bicarbonates
[00:51:41] regardless of which explanation is
[00:51:42] correct when it comes right down to it
[00:51:44] plant growth involves a lot of chemical
[00:51:46] reactions and electricity appears to
[00:51:47] have the ability to affect each and
[00:51:49] every one we're watching a madpad video
[00:51:51] on hyper Bloom you should have watch it
[00:51:53] so you know what the [ __ ] hyper Bloom
[00:51:54] does them for the better there you have
[00:51:57] it my friends the electrod dendro
[00:51:59] effects that we see in the game are
[00:52:00] absolutely adhering to real world
[00:52:03] science electricity appears to
[00:52:04] strengthen grow and wait but dude this
[00:52:07] is a wait
[00:52:08] what dude is this guy just like
[00:52:11] purposefully okay good video Matt Pat
[00:52:14] but you can't just say hyper Bloom is
[00:52:16] real and not factor in how hard it is to
[00:52:19] get em main stats in the real world some
[00:52:21] of us work 9 to five jobs we can't all
[00:52:24] get em main stats it's not a good
[00:52:26] reaction to strengthen grow and spread
[00:52:29] plants even causing them to sometimes
[00:52:31] spontanously explode out like a bunch of
[00:52:33] low-flying missiles sure the results may
[00:52:35] be a lot more bombastic in the game than
[00:52:37] they are in real life but when the
[00:52:38] alternative is literally watching the
[00:52:40] grass grow I think the choice is obvious
[00:52:43] but hey thanks again genin impact for
[00:52:45] sponsoring today's video it's been
[00:52:47] really fun to put the lore down for once
[00:52:49] and instead focus on some of the new
[00:52:51] sciencey aspects of so special thanks to
[00:52:53] them for letting us roll with something
[00:52:54] a bit out of the update and hidden EAS
[00:52:56] eggs to find kot event where you'll
[00:52:58] receive postcards directly from the
[00:53:00] characters themselves apparently there
[00:53:02] are plenty of hidden Easter eggs to find
[00:53:04] something different there's also the
[00:53:06] brand new game mode genius invocation
[00:53:08] genius invocation now has itself a
[00:53:10] trading card game collect cards play it
[00:53:12] and F trying out the new dendro open
[00:53:14] world game with that'll keep you battery
[00:53:17] in
[00:53:24] the this plant isn't producing enough
[00:53:26] fruit let's motivate it by giving it a
[00:53:29] controlled
[00:53:31] shock okay
[00:53:43] well anyways uh where were we not even
[00:53:47] two hours and the stream ended I don't
[00:53:48] know how to feel about this guys
[00:53:52] what dude I my [ __ ] stream crashed a
[00:53:56] true Z chter should know where to use
[00:53:58] these
[00:54:00] emotes dude
[00:54:03] dude
[00:54:19] dude
[00:54:22] okay Zach L ain't no way when I'm 25 I'm
[00:54:26] going to buy my own H dude this is
[00:54:27] literally dude this is
[00:54:31] optimal do you think shampoo grows on
[00:54:33] [ __ ] trees who doesn't do
[00:54:47] this true no
[00:54:50] C what the [ __ ] is
[00:54:54] this is so [ __ ] a man that keeps on
[00:54:57] stalling I'm like a poker game when I'm
[00:54:59] call and I'm
[00:55:02] Me
[00:55:09] video what was the point of that
[00:55:13] clip this video is so fun how I didn't
[00:55:16] even die like nothing
[00:55:18] happened what like what's the point of
[00:55:20] the
[00:55:22] clip dude why are they not
[00:55:25] balling is it just cuz I said balling
[00:55:31] zff zff pant versus Zombie wait this
[00:55:36] doesn't even make sense why is this
[00:55:39] what wait what yo I don't get the point
[00:55:42] of this post I just laughed cuz you
[00:55:44] wrote
[00:55:49] pant e are
[00:55:51] sunflowers oh yeah cuz it's just all
[00:55:53] sunflowers I see okay dude I was a chat
[00:55:58] were you a two rower or a three rower of
[00:56:00] sunflowers I I I I tried to Greed for
[00:56:03] three rows but two is like I usually had
[00:56:06] two but like dude I would try to get
[00:56:07] three if I
[00:56:10] could but two is like
[00:56:19] standard wait saw you voicing this guy
[00:56:21] I'm not dude I like this character he
[00:56:23] actually looks sick I just didn't pull I
[00:56:24] didn't get to get him I won't B him
[00:56:26] uh raids coming to get
[00:56:29] impact true Z brain

[00:58:03] weird ZX chattered name compilation and
[00:58:05] these three pull up okay we actually
[00:58:07] have to ban these people okay dude dude
[00:58:10] you actually have to change your name
[00:58:12] before my whole chat becomes that and
[00:58:14] and then in other chats it looks weird
[00:58:17] should you pull
[00:58:18] kazwa do you have human gums no 100%
[00:58:22] exploration you're sumaru okay yes uh
[00:58:25] win the 50 5050 and then you'll no
[00:58:27] longer have regrets lose the 50-50 play
[00:58:30] sross uninstall again true
[00:58:35] true
[00:58:36] um this is not even close to
[00:58:39] me
[00:58:41] okay I'm going to stop scrolling
[00:58:44] exclamation mark
[00:58:45] boyfriend he's not my boyfriend it is a
[00:58:50] joke we are
[00:58:55] friends 33 diar
[00:59:01] d224 out of The Frying Pan into the
[00:59:05] fire please step on me next dude what is
[00:59:08] wrong with
[00:59:10] you what is wrong with
[00:59:18] you okay I'm this is pretty sick I'm
[00:59:20] going to stop scrolling Subs says balls
[00:59:23] if you love balls pretty nice message
[00:59:27] I was having a good morning up until
[00:59:28] this point I made myself a coffee I said
[00:59:30] hey today going to be a nice productive
[00:59:32] day I'm going to have a good time I
[00:59:34] maybe will finish recording my delute
[00:59:36] guide I might like edit some things
[00:59:38] upload my zzz video watch so Z time I'm
[00:59:42] about to have a silver wolf moment if
[00:59:43] you don't stop okay 2022 listen it'll be
[00:59:46] out
[00:59:47] before 2025 okay it'll be
[00:59:51] [Music]
[00:59:55] out
[00:59:59] yo this is yo I would play
[01:00:05] [Music]
[01:00:14] this I would play
[01:00:20] that please do not the
[01:00:24] pentony
[01:00:28] fire yeah okay I I'm doing scrolling now
[01:00:31] I got to stop I got to stop I got to go
[01:00:33] I got to go I got to go I got to go I
[01:00:35] got to
[01:00:36] go I already saw
[01:00:39] this I got to
[01:00:41] go okay okay I got to
[01:00:53] go okay I'm going to say this everyone's
[01:00:55] been being duality of a man it sounds so
[01:00:59] [ __ ] stupid I'm sorry duality of men
[01:01:02] or of man sorry sounds so much better
[01:01:04] than duality of a man cuz that implies
[01:01:06] it's one man if you say duality of a man
[01:01:09] it's one person being Duality Duality of
[01:01:12] Man shows the contrast between two
[01:01:14] people a duality between two individuals
[01:01:17] one who is very a and one who is very
[01:01:20] B
[01:01:21] sorry anyways really an amazing skill
[01:01:25] you can suck in midair it's great for
[01:01:27] exploration and whenever you suck you
[01:01:30] will create a suction Vortex that sucks
[01:01:32] enemies in the great thing about this
[01:01:33] suck is that it has two versions of
[01:01:35] sucking if you care to play the game
[01:01:37] properly you can either do his holding
[01:01:39] suck technique to group enemies in a
[01:01:41] large range or if it's a boss or
[01:01:43] something like that and the enemies are
[01:01:45] already grouped up then you could use
[01:01:46] his tap suck technique kaha is just the
[01:01:49] king
[01:01:52] of he's not the king of sucking
[01:02:00] he's not the king of
[01:02:02] sucking please don't call him that I'm
[01:02:04] clicking on the
[01:02:07] spoiler right now right
[01:02:10] here okay let's go play genin We this is
[01:02:13] also we have to Star rail today we curse
[01:02:14] of
[01:02:16] aboba dude you didn't even write the
[01:02:18] [ __ ] curse I hate Zio okay we're done
[01:02:22] we're gonna go play genin
[01:02:24] um
[01:02:29] um um yeah let's start with genin then

[01:03:28] the word is reclaimed oh is it I don't
[01:03:30] know if it is my bad but I think it just
[01:03:33] isn't it just someone who's not like
[01:03:35] straight like uh I don't
[01:03:39] know that means it's fine now I
[01:03:43] see I
[01:03:53] Siege I Siege
[01:04:03] I
[01:04:10] Siege bad music it's twice [ __ ]
[01:04:13] you I don't know CH
[01:04:21] H we've been over this but uh what the
[01:04:24] [ __ ] why is the [ __ ] Primo Bap
[01:04:29] here uh
[01:04:42] yeah I don't know chat you know this I I
[01:04:45] like what I like but I don't know what I
[01:04:46] like cuz I don't have time to think
[01:04:47] about it that's not even true I don't
[01:04:49] know I don't want to think about it I
[01:04:51] don't
[01:04:52] care my Dory does more damage than your
[01:04:54] duuke at no the [ __ ] she doesn't Duo's
[01:04:57] actually good
[01:05:00] now brain rot oh
[01:05:03] no what do that even
[01:05:10] mean now it's weird okay I don't like
[01:05:12] talking about this though cuz like H I
[01:05:14] don't like talking about it cuz I don't
[01:05:15] want to pretend to be something that I'm
[01:05:17] not and I don't know what the [ __ ] I am
[01:05:19] and like I to me it doesn't matter cuz I
[01:05:21] don't need to like make a like I don't I
[01:05:23] don't care uh and the thing is when is
[01:05:26] also weird cuz there's a lot of okay
[01:05:27] okay in like the the the the not
[01:05:30] weirdest way possible uh a lot of it is
[01:05:33] a lot of this is about fictional
[01:05:35] characters and fictional characters
[01:05:36] aren't real so it's it's hard to like
[01:05:38] make the like okay like like dude I
[01:05:41] would happily live my life with Shia but
[01:05:43] he's not real so it it doesn't mean
[01:05:45] anything
[01:05:54] anyways
[01:05:59] but yeah I just also don't like labeling
[01:06:01] myself same with like like I'm like okay
[01:06:03] unironically I'm like 99% sure I have
[01:06:06] ADHD if I go see like a a licensed
[01:06:09] professional but like I don't like
[01:06:11] saying that I have something when I'm
[01:06:13] not sure or saying that I am something
[01:06:15] when I'm not sure because then it's like
[01:06:17] I feel like uh uh uh like I feel like if
[01:06:20] if I don't and then I I would feel like
[01:06:23] I'm relating to people that do and then
[01:06:25] it's like dangerous if I'm like
[01:06:26] pretending I I have something that I
[01:06:27] don't and then I don't know it's just
[01:06:30] weird but yeah I don't know but that's
[01:06:34] not to say like this is a weird slippery
[01:06:36] slope cuz like for a lot of people that
[01:06:40] uh like label themselves or like self
[01:06:42] diagnose
[01:06:43] themselves um it helps because then you
[01:06:46] kind of know you can like talk like you
[01:06:48] can like there's like ways to like deal
[01:06:49] with certain things and like it helps
[01:06:51] cuz you can like talk to other people
[01:06:52] that have similar experiences but for me
[01:06:54] uh I don't want to like be like yeah I'm
[01:06:57] part of this group and then in reality
[01:06:58] I'm not and then it's like well I well I
[01:07:00] don't like I'm not lying like I don't
[01:07:02] want to be like [ __ ] like pretending
[01:07:04] like I've struggled or some [ __ ] I don't
[01:07:06] know anyways yeah so I don't know it's
[01:07:09] always been like weird for me so I try
[01:07:11] to just avoid talking about
[01:07:17] it woo benched bro it's not it's
[01:07:24] closed you can't can't be wrong about
[01:07:26] your own label well yeah but like well I
[01:07:28] mean you can well I can't if you're okay
[01:07:30] if you're like a public thing and like
[01:07:33] you you you say you're something and
[01:07:34] then the next day you're not something
[01:07:35] then it's going to be weird like I don't
[01:07:38] know it's not worth it for
[01:07:41] me anyways chat I was trying rotations
[01:07:43] with duuke Z was telling me about this
[01:07:46] rotation where you do finina Q before E

[01:53:01] a speedrun or like 60 or like something
[01:53:03] like that but like I'm on Marios so I
[01:53:05] can't be under

[01:53:55] I mean I could go Freedom sword and
[01:53:56] Bennett if I want to hit higher I think
[01:53:58] it's fine I don't need to hit higher
[01:54:00] like that was a good clear no one cares
[01:54:04] right there was no buff I missed right
[01:54:07] there's no way to deal more damage there
[01:54:08] unless I wait for finina Stacks to stack
[01:54:10] up but like that's wait this card is
[01:54:12] just objectively better okay
[01:54:21] wait
[01:54:29] okay
[01:54:38] okay to shine like that's fair that that

[01:56:05] trying to be respectful oh I didn't
[01:56:07] press e on chuun it's
[01:56:09] fine how did that

[01:56:21] lagging
[01:56:34] laptop issue
[01:56:36] true you okay forena Vape
[01:56:42] whatever and ironically this was almost
[01:56:51] better
[01:56:54] actually guy noted for to EQ Shen Benet
[01:56:57] uh I think okay the S rotation is
[01:56:59] Bennett before Shen Yun but shenyun
[01:57:01] before Bennett I think is better cuz it
[01:57:03] gives you more up time also zad was
[01:57:05] saying you could do uh uh finina Q
[01:57:08] before E and then e and then swap to
[01:57:10] shenyun and then q and then Bennett q
[01:57:13] and then e and then shenon basic but uh
[01:57:15] I felt like here when I was doing it you
[01:57:17] have to wait for D like you have to wait
[01:57:18] for hydro here after this plunge see now
[01:57:21] it's Pyro I don't like this one as much
[01:57:23] even though like I think technically
[01:57:25] it's better but or with C6 B is better
[01:57:27] cuz you don't need to Al
[01:57:31] so I
[01:57:35] I

[02:07:31] like hot women should I skip kwell for
[02:07:33] father and clind or just pull I mean I
[02:07:37] think
[02:07:46] um uh I mean yeah I mean I mean
[02:08:00] use money
[02:08:04] LOL nette or arino but you butchered her
[02:08:08] name I'm going to be honest okay pull
[02:08:12] for who you like okay this is going to
[02:08:14] be a very important moment in genin
[02:08:16] history to say pull for who you like and
[02:08:18] what brings you enjoyment okay
[02:08:22] um because I don't know how good arino
[02:08:25] is yet but the odds of her being better
[02:08:28] than Kazo arino are um you know they're
[02:08:31] there but they're they're not like the
[02:08:34] highest but I'm sure she'll be
[02:08:43] good I mean like dude I but it doesn't
[02:08:46] really M like it doesn't matter to
[02:08:47] everyone like dor could be [ __ ]
[02:08:49] garbage and I'll still like [ __ ] can
[02:08:51] probably main him I mean I would main sh
[02:08:54] but like he he'd be he'd be he'd be he'd

[02:09:02] Team fake

[02:09:24] wicked go for aaza and then grind the
[02:09:27] [ __ ] out of 4.6 to get
[02:09:28] arino yeah but like you don't want to
[02:09:31] you don't want to
[02:09:32] like I feel
[02:09:35] like I don't know it depends how much
[02:09:38] you play and how much you have left to
[02:09:42] explore but both of them will come back
[02:09:44] so you don't have to be like it's not as
[02:09:46] fomo as you
[02:09:48] think although if you are what the [ __ ]
[02:09:50] is this if you are really afraid of fomo
[02:09:52] go AR Lino because no one's talking
[02:09:54] about Kazo anymore even though he's
[02:09:55] super broken cuz it's been like 3 years
[02:09:58] um but like
[02:10:01] realistically if you haven't already
[02:10:03] like fully done everything and have a
[02:10:05] lot to do you could get
[02:10:06] both but you might also just get [ __ ]
[02:10:08] and
[02:10:09] unlucky Ka still broken yeah yeah for
[02:10:14] sure shine pull as far like I I I I've
[02:10:19] said this pull value is just like Nikita
[02:10:22] kazua and the hydros those are like the
[02:10:24] highest full value and then the rest is
[02:10:26] like
[02:10:33] variable hey hey Pooky
[02:10:37] Wookie don't call me
[02:10:40] that order

[02:10:50] order
[02:10:53] okay I can't
[02:10:54] even why is everything going wrong at
[02:11:00] once I might have something to
[02:11:03] um
[02:11:09] level dude they wouldn't [ __ ] they
[02:11:12] wouldn't cancel my order if they knew I
[02:11:14] was the rank one Shia if they saw my
[02:11:16] crit damage they wouldn't cancel my
[02:11:20] order
[02:11:30] okay [ __ ]

[02:12:45] actually not the best so if I get like
[02:12:47] er or attack and then it rolls crit this

[02:25:45] is what it

[02:25:53] it get it and if you don't want to play

[02:26:02] it not this domain again wait what's
[02:26:05] wrong with this
[02:26:06] domain theuk guy dude duuke is it's like
[02:26:09] done like it's out like today okay

[02:33:52] like that with this game
[02:33:54] also uh this is what I'm going to read
[02:33:56] to you uh so that I I I read it properly
[02:33:59] during the test period cross feature ban
[02:34:01] feature the cross device ban feature
[02:34:03] will be activated log to the same
[02:34:04] account on multiple devices uh yeah
[02:34:06] that's what I just said will be banned
[02:34:07] okay also I cannot guarantee the

[02:57:23] to how does everyone have so much speed
[02:57:25] I'm a speed
[02:57:30] demon wait chat question
[02:57:40] question should I just buy this and use
[02:57:47] it
[02:57:48] it's ass wait what are you yapping about
[02:57:51] for Pure fiction wait you're actually
[02:57:55] copage this is like the CFA lyone if
[02:57:57] I've ever seen
[02:57:59] one you are coping I'm
[02:58:02] sorry don't you have her that I don't
[02:58:04] have any good lons for nil except acons
[02:58:07] I'm not putting this on
[02:58:16] acaron only for Pure fiction yeah what
[02:58:18] do you think I'm doing sorry sorry sorry
[02:58:21] sorry I'll stop
[02:58:29] yelling pain better [ __ ] does it
[02:58:32] look like I have
[02:58:40] pain skill issue okay what is with star
[02:58:45] rail's culture of S1 being default on
[02:58:47] everyone but in genjin I get called a
[02:58:50] whale if I pull for the
[02:58:51] signature how would I have
[02:58:54] pain what is pain is isn't it cfas
[02:58:56] leyone isn't that what it's called I
[02:58:58] don't [ __ ] have
[02:59:01] it easier to get here I mean yeah it is
[02:59:05] but still it's still a [ __ ] five
[02:59:10] star wait okay if you follow that logic
[02:59:12] and okay okay okay okay okay okay if I'm
[02:59:15] coping tell me I'm coping if if if if if
[02:59:17] if if if if if if L cones are easier to
[02:59:19] get here than weapons right okay okay
[02:59:21] wouldn't that make it to where on
[02:59:23] average to get e0 s0 you're still
[02:59:25] spending more than if you just get the
[02:59:27] character in genjin without the [ __ ]
[02:59:28] weapon so then on average you're going
[02:59:30] to get less characters that you like
[02:59:31] which means you're going to fomo more
[02:59:33] and you're going to spend more
[02:59:44] money hoyo wins either way true
[02:59:49] anyways doesn't matter um I have five

[03:06:13] cuz like I use iner on so many [ __ ]
[03:06:14] characters I know I know like I can use
[03:06:16] isumo on on on on acon but like it's
[03:06:20] barely better and I'm not using isumo on
[03:06:22] like anyone else except like topaz uh
[03:06:25] ratio but like I don't give a [ __ ] about
[03:06:27] topaz ratio so like I don't know why I
[03:06:29] wouldn't just far more inner Salo cuz
[03:06:31] you I can use on like everyone I used to
[03:06:33] use glami but like I I swear like I
[03:06:36] don't know I don't know I don't know I
[03:06:37] don't know I I'll figure it
[03:06:42] out isumo is slightly better but like
[03:06:44] very slightly like you know a little bit
[03:06:49] better you can synthesize isumo okay but
[03:06:52] here's the
[03:06:53] thing if I get a good eumo piece it's
[03:06:57] usable on like a handful of characters
[03:06:59] but if I get a good uh inert piece I can
[03:07:02] all use it on almost
[03:07:08] everyone not try to M Max well like I
[03:07:11] mean my main is blade like if I'm turbo
[03:07:14] b maxing I'm choosing blade I'm not
[03:07:16] choosing someone else
[03:07:18] like I like blade more so like I
[03:07:20] wouldn't like do some dumb inefficient
[03:07:22] [ __ ] like in genin I'm efficient except
[03:07:24] for sha I wouldn't do inefficient stuff
[03:07:27] for my non
[03:07:32] main
[03:07:39] anyways oops I didn't mean do
[03:07:43] that listen to The Chronicles of yussi
[03:07:50] all right new pure fiction we're going
[03:07:54] to do three and
[03:07:55] four uh weak to physical weak to
[03:07:57] lightning that's all I needed to hear so
[03:07:59] we're going to do Argentina shout out
[03:08:02] Argentina first half with sparkle Ting
[03:08:06] Yun uh I probably don't need a Healer
[03:08:09] but we'll bring wo and then second half
[03:08:11] we're going to
[03:08:12] do
[03:08:14] acaron
[03:08:16] with
[03:08:20] paila Black Swan and then I'm gonna do
[03:08:24] Fen but if I don't get 80k points on the
[03:08:27] last one I might go
[03:08:30] Ron just to to give me more damage and
[03:08:32] then hope I don't die because Ron is
[03:08:34] obviously way the [ __ ] better than a
[03:08:35] Healer if I don't need to get healed
[03:08:37] Kafka no I don't want to play Kafka
[03:08:38] maybe but I don't think I need to I'd
[03:08:40] rather uh yeah I don't think I need to
[03:08:42] but I could I mean if I'm doing no
[03:08:44] healer then I yeah I could just do
[03:08:45] [ __ ] Kafka runme and then I win like
[03:08:47] this is probably a good no healer team
[03:08:49] but
[03:08:50] um
[03:08:52] yeah let do
[03:08:56] this not a whale he said silver wolf in
[03:09:00] single in
[03:09:02] AOE sorry uh um we're gonna
[03:09:11] do this looks
[03:09:14] good
[03:09:16] yeah
[03:09:23] I think I'm using these two
[03:09:25] right I'm using these two but I don't
[03:09:27] know
[03:09:30] wait use their
[03:09:36] abilities is this a debuff this looks
[03:09:39] like a debuff wait this also
[03:09:43] does yes okay I'm getting that to acon
[03:09:46] then
[03:09:49] and then this one I do the action
[03:09:50] advance that looks broken no I give
[03:09:52] Argent T err Rope two e energy giving
[03:09:56] supports I spam his
[03:09:58] alt AG agre agre agre
[03:10:06] agre can acon clear the first half don't
[03:10:08] know don't care we put a second half
[03:10:10] true but
[03:10:16] probably
[03:10:29] oh okay chat this might be the worst
[03:10:31] take you've ever heard but I was trying
[03:10:32] to build my Argent right I was building
[03:10:34] my Argent and I was like okay I need so
[03:10:37] I had twopiece attack twopiece speed and
[03:10:40] then I was like okay well I don't need
[03:10:41] speed if I'm running Sparkle and then I
[03:10:43] was like okay well I would go to Beast
[03:10:46] physical but then I clicked on the
[03:10:48] physical set and let me show you how
[03:10:50] many of the physical sets I have zero so
[03:10:53] I was like wait a second what if I do
[03:10:57] twopiece of the debuff set and then I
[03:10:59] assume that in pure fiction enemies are
[03:11:01] going to get random debuffs like I'll
[03:11:02] break something or something will happen
[03:11:04] so I don't know cuz I haven't done it
[03:11:07] but I assume enemies will be debuffed
[03:11:09] that's just my guess and substats are
[03:11:11] good so like [ __ ]
[03:11:13] it like like like surely this is fine
[03:11:16] we'll see though we'll see it might be
[03:11:18] cat but I feel like it'll
[03:11:26] work run two dots set that's what I was
[03:11:28] going to do so I had this uh Circ or
[03:11:30] whatever it's called body I had this but
[03:11:32] I have nothing else look if you look at
[03:11:33] my like head I have this which has no
[03:11:35] crit and this that has no crit and then
[03:11:37] if I scroll down I have I don't know why
[03:11:39] I didn't keep crit on the set or maybe I
[03:11:41] just didn't get any I feel like I would
[03:11:42] have kept it yeah so I don't have
[03:11:44] it farming every day by the way bro you
[03:11:47] think I'm farming every set and every
[03:11:50] character mat and every credit and every
[03:11:53] XP book I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 what's
[03:12:00] after 9 10 11 12 I like 30 [ __ ]
[03:12:03] leveled characters okay it's hard for me
[03:12:05] to also Farm every Relic set and every
[03:12:07] [ __ ] trace and every [ __ ]
[03:12:09] everything it's hard okay it's
[03:12:14] hard
[03:12:16] anyways
[03:12:19] I'm going to do no healer second half CU
[03:12:21] if I need a Healer then I [ __ ] suck
[03:12:23] you can quote me on
[03:12:31] that uh I think my oh I don't have a
[03:12:35] two-piece on her
[03:12:41] what I'm not using fushan right now can
[03:12:44] do this it's
[03:12:46] fine
[03:12:51] what the [ __ ] that's was fine actually
[03:12:53] yeah that's good that's
[03:12:57] fine I probably don't need this build
[03:12:59] for ah whatever doesn't matter it's
[03:13:01] going to be easy okay let's let's start
[03:13:02] at three I'll figure it out for four but
[03:13:04] it should be

[03:29:27] it's just ghost sub stats so it's not a
[03:29:29] big
[03:29:32] deal but it's weird cuz it's like I'm
[03:29:36] very much a ghost substats and don't
[03:29:37] care too much but like if if the people
[03:29:40] I'm talking to are like you need to go
[03:29:43] dance dance dance then the answer is
[03:29:46] also well you know [ __ ] like okay
[03:29:49] let's say you're playing Aron there's
[03:29:51] literally no reason in the world not to
[03:29:53] give your supports like turbo Max Speed
[03:29:56] like like literally just [ __ ] put
[03:29:58] your silver wolf on wiet and just go all
[03:30:00] the time there's like no reason not
[03:30:06] to

[03:40:57] all Beauty all of it every Beauty damn
[03:41:05] argy's no power U I'm going to basic my
[03:41:09] Guiding
[03:41:14] Light protect all
[03:41:18] Beauty you're
[03:41:22] S A we'll do this and then argental cuz
[03:41:27] he's
[03:41:29] buffed all right this is going really
[03:41:31] well actually it is going really really
[03:41:32] well I think uh that's a [ __ ] is that
[03:41:35] a level two alt already
[03:41:38] damn car
[03:41:41] once I return once
[03:41:44] more
[03:41:46] until I will protect all
[03:41:49] Beauty was that a level one Al actually
[03:41:51] in hindsight why I think it was level
[03:41:52] two I don't know I forget the difference
[03:41:54] in the symbols it's been a
[03:41:57] minute that's not true it actually just
[03:41:59] looks the same
[03:42:03] them
[03:42:09] Beauty why is my skill point situation
[03:42:12] worse than I
[03:42:14] thought
[03:42:19] I don't have my e wait this is
[03:42:24] wait it's fine I lose his attack percent
[03:42:29] will you find the
[03:42:32] answer my is
[03:42:36] to
[03:42:38] until I shouldn't have uh I did one hoo
[03:42:41] skill too many and I should have had a
[03:42:42] Ting Yun skill up I should still 40K on
[03:42:45] not going to jinx it I should still be
[03:42:46] able to 40K but I messed up on one skill
[03:42:51] pointcom but it's
[03:42:53] fine I
[03:42:58] think not a
[03:43:00] St take this ends
[03:43:04] here until I think it's fine prot all
[03:43:10] Beauty I'm going to hold everyone back
[03:43:13] again uh can I for to skill here I can
[03:43:17] because skill point and then basic and
[03:43:19] then skill
[03:43:20] yeah I don't think it matters so I don't
[03:43:22] think I'm going to Al on her anyways but
[03:43:24] there's no power team this and then
[03:43:37] this sparkle buff expires at the start
[03:43:40] of my turn which means now if I alt it
[03:43:42] does less damage than if I wait and
[03:43:43] Sparkle e but I think I can alt and then
[03:43:45] e and then Sparkle e and then alt again
[03:43:49] yourek so I think I alt I could have
[03:43:52] aled before my turn started though that
[03:43:54] would have been better but like it's you
[03:43:56] have like no time dude I'm like rushing
[03:43:59] to mash buttons it's [ __ ] annoying oh
[03:44:03] I hate you
[03:44:10] Sparkle 38 H I hate you that's my fault
[03:44:14] if it's tigu and E was off I would have
[03:44:16] killed I think and I I missed the tigu
[03:44:18] and E dude I have to play perfectly I
[03:44:20] like that though at least it's hard like
[03:44:22] life can get hard can you if you can't
[03:44:24] please see your
[03:44:29] doctor what if we do no healer like do I
[03:44:32] actually need the healing I could just

[03:45:25] chat while I'm doing it I'm just doing
[03:45:37] it he to be fair it's the first time I
[03:45:40] do this [ __ ] pure
[03:45:43] fiction EX

[03:45:50] wonders oh

[03:46:41] way my
[03:46:43] is
[03:46:45] I'll go e until I I will protect all

[03:47:04] protect all
[03:47:09] beauty beauty is
[03:47:12] eternal I will protect all Beauty
[03:47:17] what does Sparkle do chat racism no I'm
[03:47:20] kidding she uh well I mean that's lore
[03:47:23] but uh I digress uh she does a lot of
[03:47:25] stuff she gives you like skill points
[03:47:27] crit damage uh action Advance 50% but
[03:47:30] usually that's enough uh to bring your
[03:47:32] character uh uh immediately after her
[03:47:34] provided she doesn't have twice the
[03:47:35] speed of your DPS uh and like you build
[03:47:37] her correctly so usually you do base
[03:47:39] speed DPS and 160 speed on your sparkle
[03:47:42] 16.1 or whatever uh uh and yeah pretty
[03:47:46] good I really don't want a one target
[03:47:49] alt please oh but I need to Eon run
[03:47:55] may I think I'm supposed to Al here
[03:47:58] because if I if I don't Al and I press
[03:48:00] on Sparkle it uh doesn't the act the the
[03:48:03] thing ends the act like the cycle ends
[03:48:05] but would it just end
[03:48:08] anyways I know in memory of chaos you
[03:48:10] alt but I'm not sure about pure fiction
[03:48:11] I think I
[03:48:12] do could be wrong though cuz P fiction
[03:48:15] is different than
[03:48:20] memory yeah the cycle still [ __ ]
[03:48:22] ended [ __ ] this game it was fine
[03:48:26] though
[03:48:28] Beauty yeah it doesn't refresh the cycle
[03:48:30] yeah you're right in pure in pure
[03:48:32] fiction I don't think I out there well I
[03:48:34] learned something okay H you live you
[03:48:37] learn I'm I'm AOC enjoyer I have one
[03:48:41] skill point argent's next oh my God this
[03:48:43] is a National tragedy wait no it's fine
[03:48:47] e and then e and then alt we're chilling
[03:48:48] we're chilling Bing chilling we e and
[03:48:50] then we e and then we
[03:48:54] [Music]
[03:48:55] alt and then basic Al on
[03:49:01] run that's Black Swan I'm sorry I miss
[03:49:09] you
[03:49:11] until will protect all Beauty nice
[03:49:18] ET my guard is dead
[03:49:21] here boom we still have no healer so
[03:49:24] it's a little bit scary but I think
[03:49:25] we're fine
[03:49:27] Sparkle feeling spiffy I don't even know
[03:49:30] what that
[03:49:31] means but sure thing Sparkle prot all
[03:49:38] Beauty some value I
[03:49:43] suppose uh how many skill points do I
[03:49:45] have not enough is the answer cuz I
[03:49:47] skill skill skill yeah so I need to
[03:49:49] basic here and now I have enough to
[03:49:50] skill skill
[03:49:54] skill my tting Yun might not have enough
[03:49:57] I might have to basic on Argent because
[03:50:00] so here I skill and then if I don't
[03:50:03] basic
[03:50:05] on oh wait it's teu next oh the action
[03:50:08] Advance is 50% or not not 100% okay uh
[03:50:12] is this worth Al thing yes it is alt e
[03:50:17] alt yeah
[03:50:24] wonders until I I will protect all
[03:50:33] Beauty dude it happens El oh my God I
[03:50:37] mean we win it it's fine we get 40K but
[03:50:40] the skill points near the end like it
[03:50:41] started like jumbling I don't know dude
[03:50:45] but it's fine we're done like we win
[03:50:47] here do this alt can you find the
[03:50:52] answer like it's not even bad it's fine
[03:50:54] we win 40K no healer we had a full cycle
[03:50:58] to spare uh I learned something new I
[03:51:00] learned that I shouldn't have Argent
[03:51:02] aled there because it's not M chaos so
[03:51:04] the cycle yeah okay now acon time I I
[03:51:07] assume I can just run no healer here too
[03:51:09] cuz I ran no healer first half so I
[03:51:11] probably should bench uh fushen but
[03:51:23] anyways you have Tren on fan
[03:51:33] yes so hopefully they hit my fan I'm
[03:51:36] just going to Al at the start I don't
[03:51:38] think I uh I think it probably kills
[03:51:41] even without like P maybe 512 yeah okay
[03:51:47] easy now we'll do this then
[03:51:52] alt then BL Swan e f run
[03:51:58] basic hopefully they hit my
[03:52:02] fan that is not
[03:52:08] fan that's half the
[03:52:10] work
[03:52:13] cool
[03:52:17] I weep for the depart quick tip I I uh
[03:52:22] press V when you Al it saves the [ __ ]
[03:52:25] mashing your space bar or CH I mean you
[03:52:27] could choose the enemies manually but
[03:52:29] Auto I'm pretty sure Auto chooses the
[03:52:31] enemy with the highest Crimson KN Stacks
[03:52:33] right which is usually what you
[03:52:37] want
[03:52:42] so going BAS
[03:52:45] a
[03:52:49] skill I wait for
[03:52:57] theart boom that is a lot of
[03:53:02] explosions wait are two enemies I
[03:53:04] thought there was going to be more why

[03:55:37] easy content right uh you need to know
[03:55:38] what you're doing but as a season star
[03:55:40] rail veteran uh I know what I'm doing
[03:55:42] evidently not because of the way I
[03:55:44] played well actually I dude I played
[03:55:46] well I'm tired of this [ __ ] I'm tired of
[03:55:47] pretending I did it okay I [ __ ] up my
[03:55:49] skill points twice is that embarrassing
[03:55:52] yes but it's not even that bad and
[03:55:54] everything else is good okay
[03:55:57] cool all right that's
[03:56:00] fun filthy
[03:56:02] whale I will show you my builds wait why
[03:56:05] does it why does it default to this I
[03:56:07] swear I changed whatever uh I will show
[03:56:10] you all my builds okay acon is e0 S1
[03:56:14] it's says it's EZ by the way like this
[03:56:15] looks like it's lit up but I didn't
[03:56:16] activate it it's EZ uh EZ S one we're on
[03:56:20] 1088 this [ __ ] boom uh paila is just
[03:56:23] full speed literally no build like cuz I
[03:56:25] thought I was going to play silver wolf
[03:56:26] so I geared my silver wolf but uh we're
[03:56:28] playing paila so I didn't I just gave
[03:56:30] her speed it doesn't actually matter um
[03:56:32] FW is just beinging chilling also like
[03:56:35] why is my planner not I don't know it
[03:56:37] doesn't [ __ ] matter dude but uh yeah
[03:56:39] usually I give her a real pter I just
[03:56:40] give her trend for debuff and then Black
[03:56:43] Swan is on some speed some attack eye of
[03:56:46] the prey S2 pan and and prisoner I only
[03:56:49] have pan cuz I good substats on it I I I
[03:56:51] don't recommend farming for that speed
[03:56:53] Sparkle that's all that matters but
[03:56:54] we're on ke messenger I could have more
[03:56:57] crit damage but it is what it is we're
[03:56:58] also ezo we also don't have S1 cuz I'm
[03:57:01] not pulling for that uh Ronald May is
[03:57:05] 889 S4 Memories by the way but it is
[03:57:08] what it is uh and we have random stuff
[03:57:10] while vwac TP toop uh and my co is on
[03:57:15] just a normal healer build broken Keel
[03:57:17] traveler Chi by LLY cone and uh dance
[03:57:20] dance dance I just leveled this you're
[03:57:23] welcome yeah this is fine pretty decent
[03:57:26] uh I don't think she's like super
[03:57:28] optimized I think I just have speed like
[03:57:29] speed speed speed with attack speed with
[03:57:33] some attack HP sphere so I don't die
[03:57:35] with 20 this is okay this is my bronia
[03:57:38] sphere ah this is my bronia sphere okay
[03:57:41] it's usually on bronia that's why
[03:57:43] there's 29 crit damage
[03:57:44] but I don't know I just I wanted the set
[03:57:46] effect so I just gave it to her it's not
[03:57:48] usually on her but it's fine okay I like
[03:57:51] the thing is I share planner ornaments
[03:57:53] with a lot of characters that's why when
[03:57:55] you look at my f you're like Dude
[03:57:56] Where's the planner ornament well
[03:57:57] usually I have like Fleet of the Ageless
[03:58:00] for example right or a broken Keel and
[03:58:02] then I'll like yoink this but I play a
[03:58:05] lot of characters it is what it is uh
[03:58:08] yeah Optimus
[03:58:11] Felix yeah Argent is also like he's okay
[03:58:14] we have Night of the Milky Way we have
[03:58:16] twopiece inert twopiece musketeer
[03:58:18] twopiece feels crafted Pioneer because I
[03:58:22] don't have another twopiece this one uh
[03:58:24] I don't have good subsets on and I don't
[03:58:25] have the physical set so it's like well
[03:58:27] I assume the enemies are going to be
[03:58:28] debuffed so [ __ ] it I have good Subs
[03:58:30] we're going to put the two be debuffs
[03:58:31] set because there's nothing else I can
[03:58:32] put and speed doesn't matter cuz we're
[03:58:33] running Sparkle so I don't actually need
[03:58:35] speed um and my ratio is pretty good I
[03:58:37] have the crit damage from his Trace it's
[03:58:39] like 23 or something yeah crit rate not
[03:58:42] crit damage so 23 Plus 46 which is 68 so
[03:58:45] we're chilling or 69 so we're
[03:58:53] chilling
[03:58:57] nice oh
[03:58:59] yeah I think all our five stars are
[03:59:03] EO
[03:59:13] yeah
[03:59:14] what the [ __ ] go max out your Argent I
[03:59:16] don't think physical weakness leaves PF
[03:59:17] anytime soon yeah but like we 80k right
[03:59:20] so like I don't need to like mid Max
[03:59:22] further right it's like 998 whatever I
[03:59:25] don't even have this attack
[03:59:26] thing
[03:59:29] whatever cuz like there's so many like I
[03:59:31] just leveled Argent uh not ARG Hera and
[03:59:34] QQ actually I didn't gear QQ yet but I
[03:59:36] geared Hera and like it's dude there's
[03:59:39] so like I it's so hard to have resources
[03:59:41] for everyone and Relic XP it's hard
[03:59:59] man did even use Hera
[04:00:04] yeah

[04:46:45] residence foreplay thing
[04:46:47] interplay uh followup attacks it
[04:46:50] triggered another time wait so does it
[04:46:53] trigger twice if my alar counts as a
[04:46:54] followup
[04:46:58] attack yeah it should
[04:47:00] right that's actually pretty
[04:47:08] POG when a character provides healing I
[04:47:10] like other than field I don't need
[04:47:16] that I mean we could just take it it
[04:47:18] might be worth resetting wait how good
[04:47:21] is this fall up attack they deal after
[04:47:22] taste damage equal to 55% of their
[04:47:25] attack one to three
[04:47:34] times am I going to run I mean what's my
[04:47:36] last comp going to
[04:47:39] be maybe we want this to not die this is
[04:47:42] useless cuz we don't need more damage
[04:47:43] this is pretty
[04:47:46] cracked fush run heals yeah I know but
[04:47:48] we might also run
[04:47:52] Lua like we might go double sustain ah

[04:48:17] actually [ __ ]
[04:48:23] it I
[04:48:27] mean it's maybe good like we got a big
[04:48:31] Lotto it could be

[05:48:04] speed I'm going to be um with my skill
[05:48:07] points this
[05:48:13] time because you get a lot of like
[05:48:15] random like Advanced forwards and like

[06:03:08] child okay that's
[06:03:14] true I me I could literally just go
[06:03:16] abundance and then like easy mode or
[06:03:18] nahil Kafka Black Swan and easy
[06:03:33] mode I could literally CFA Black Swan
[06:03:39] Ron May
[06:03:48] [Music]
[06:04:04] fan
[06:04:08] I also like uh
[06:04:10] destruction uh blade and then just like
[06:04:13] pick a bunch of defensive [ __ ] and you
[06:04:14] just don't
[06:04:17] die cuz Blade's a [ __ ] tank blade
[06:04:19] doesn't really
[06:04:27] die yeah but we want to see acaron dude
[06:04:31] why do you want dude dude I just do to
[06:04:33] has jingan yet
[06:04:47] blade is a glass Cannon no the [ __ ] he's
[06:04:50] not what are you yapping
[06:04:55] about you can literally triple HP main
[06:04:58] stat him if you're
[06:05:00] scared I have
[06:05:04] 7500
[06:05:12] you'd still die okay
[06:05:19] true I would probably still die the
[06:05:23] problem with this is I have to [ __ ]
[06:05:29] like watch Mojo would
[06:05:34] clear okay do I actually want to play
[06:05:36] acon okay dude does acon even do
[06:05:38] anything with these cuz doesn't this
[06:05:39] just buff your dot
[06:05:42] damage like is The Hil even good with
[06:05:47] Aron
[06:05:49] yeah a lot of debuffs yeah I mean yeah
[06:05:52] but like her damage doesn't scale on
[06:05:56] like for the most part her damage isn't
[06:05:58] scaling based on like the dots you're
[06:05:59] applying it just gives her her alt
[06:06:04] faster
[06:06:13] just so much better yeah that's what I
[06:06:14] think but I kind of want to play um a
[06:06:16] different path I mean we could just do
[06:06:18] it again like I think that run was just
[06:06:20] unlucky well like I yeah I think it was
[06:06:23] just a [ __ ]
[06:06:24] run like we could just run it back I
[06:06:26] could also
[06:06:28] try like Black Swan or some
[06:06:34] [ __ ]
[06:06:38] five [ __ ] did it was only two
[06:06:41] runs I can also wait what the [ __ ] is

[06:13:44] okay um
[06:13:49] okay I just got B from
[06:13:56] standard oh wait recommended
[06:13:59] is it's
[06:14:01] fine doesn't matter we're not [ __ ]
[06:14:03] lore progressing
[06:14:07] bricked it's actually fine it does not
[06:14:10] matter it's going to go
[06:14:12] down right
[06:14:15] here yoink this
[06:14:19] H wait okay this has to be good right
[06:14:23] 25% of the HP in a shield we have to
[06:14:27] take

[06:14:34] this
[06:14:35] uh yeah I lowy like this but that's not

[06:14:40] one this is good if I double
[06:14:45] alt dude am I stupid if I
[06:14:49] reset it's fine to take yeah but like
[06:14:52] it's it's so I feel like the upgrade
[06:14:54] does nothing like who cares if you res
[06:14:56] at 50 or at 75 hp like you're you're
[06:14:58] healing anyways you're not going to die
[06:15:00] and then die again so the the enhance is
[06:15:03] like useless
[06:15:10] it's about
[06:15:14] energy oh wait it
[06:15:20] is well yeah but it doesn't matter
[06:15:22] though you you heal HP equal to x amount
[06:15:25] of energy consumed no one cares it's
[06:15:27] just how much you
[06:15:30] heal like you want this blessing but you
[06:15:32] don't want it [ __ ] upgraded right
[06:15:35] like compared to the other upgrades I

[06:17:12] negative curio there's actually no
[06:17:25] way that's not bad though honestly plus
[06:17:27] 100 Cosmic fragments is not even
[06:17:33] bad
[06:17:38] that could have been Ron May dude the
[06:17:40] the odds of that happening is literally
[06:17:41] one in your lifetime okay buddy calm

[06:18:43] good this combat needs this is double
[06:18:46] speed this is double speed
[06:18:51] crazy I weep for the depart why do you
[06:18:54] have J to
[06:18:56] everything I don't

[06:19:02] disease I wait for the Department
[06:19:12] all right that's done give me this brain
[06:19:15] in a
[06:19:23] vat if the the current exploration will
[06:19:27] not terminate if your team is defeated
[06:19:30] in a battle outside of a final
[06:19:32] domain sheesh
[06:19:43] you need it no I
[06:19:46] don't I don't need it but dude
[06:19:50] obliteration Wick doesn't even do
[06:19:51] anything for us

[06:20:06] you crit damage okay I can't dude I'm

[06:20:29] allowed to take defensive [ __ ] [ __ ]
[06:20:30] this whole
[06:20:32] plane also I think the countdown is a
[06:20:35] okay we probably should have taken the
[06:20:36] dice that doesn't [ __ ] our countdown but
[06:20:38] I think the countdown is a is a myth
[06:20:40] made by the government and we just
[06:20:42] ignore it and we take as much [ __ ] as we
[06:20:43] can true.com what's up
[06:20:48] hero I'm going to YOLO a curio please
[06:20:51] get lucky uh that's
[06:20:53] good this is also good
[06:20:56] actually
[06:20:58] uh I wonder which one's yeah society's
[06:21:01] probably better on average but I'm not
[06:21:02] going to do that many battles so maybe
[06:21:04] chaos going to take us [ __ ] it I don't
[06:21:07] think we're doing that many
[06:21:09] battles turn an elite domain or
[06:21:11] Adventure domain into a reward domain
[06:21:14] okay we need to do occurrences so we do
[06:21:17] this
[06:21:21] into okay that kind of sucks we could do
[06:21:23] boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[06:21:26] [ __ ] long ass diagonal or we could do
[06:21:28] like that that get the adventure
[06:21:31] boom boom boom or like boom boom
[06:21:35] [Music]
[06:21:39] oh okay
[06:21:49] sus I'll join
[06:22:00] you uh I only did this for the [ __ ]
[06:22:03] path resonance [ __ ]
[06:22:09] none of these do anything right now but
[06:22:10] if we get the the thing that turns our
[06:22:12] alt into full up attack
[06:22:15] then I mean honestly skill point is not
[06:22:17] even bad for
[06:22:19] us yeah
[06:22:21] fine does nothing right now
[06:22:26] though probably should have reset it but
[06:22:29] it's
[06:22:31] fine okay now we definitely go down
[06:22:35] transaction with 40 [ __ ] money I am
[06:22:40] cooked dude I don't even want to talk to
[06:22:42] these guys I'm sorry D I'm sorry that is
[06:22:46] so
[06:22:48] bad

[06:22:59] good
[06:23:01] um we could do like down down boom boom
[06:23:04] boom does that work I kind of want to go
[06:23:06] to occurrence
[06:23:15] but like I feel like I just wasted like
[06:23:17] two steps like the last two have been
[06:23:19] like useless wait none of them is
[06:23:20] recommended where do I want to go
[06:23:24] Bro [ __ ]
[06:23:26] it t chance one point of the
[06:23:31] countdown do I [ __ ] want one point in
[06:23:33] the countdown
[06:23:36] where's the
[06:23:41] map

[06:24:30] dude oh they're so good I mean I could
[06:24:34] dude
[06:24:36] this is so much but enhancing two three
[06:24:40] stars is really good
[06:24:42] too I think discarding the clock is bait
[06:24:45] I don't care about minus two skill
[06:24:46] points I don't think it's that big of a
[06:24:48] deal enhance two random three
[06:24:54] stars okay but if I if I enhance this my
[06:24:57] run is over if this one gets enhanced
[06:24:59] it's actually [ __ ] over for me and my
[06:25:01] my
[06:25:03] monitor
[06:25:06] yeah 400 is a lot like that's a lot but
[06:25:10] can I even spend it like now like am I
[06:25:13] just going to die to Yan Ching
[06:25:16] again I know 400 is better than two like
[06:25:19] price-wise but like this I get now what
[06:25:22] if I die to Yan Ching before I get to
[06:25:33] enhance
[06:25:39] okay 'll ask again Z do you like B

[06:37:52] reset we have two resets and I I like
[06:37:56] this is good but I think we could do
[06:38:01] better um

[06:38:17] the for the interplay we have the

[06:39:25] no when a character use their ultimate
[06:39:27] gain of Shield oh that's so good but I'm
[06:39:30] I'm going to be
[06:39:32] broke
[06:39:34] oh
[06:39:36] POG scam shop true but like this is so
[06:39:40] good I'm sorry dude 300 for that curio
[06:39:43] is actually insane though that's like
[06:39:46] two like [ __ ] five star upgrade or
[06:39:47] like golden [ __ ] blessing
[06:39:56] upgrades select An Occurrence occurrence
[06:39:59] reward obtain one blessing turn it into
[06:40:02] a blank domain
[06:40:04] uh I guess we go up turn this one
[06:40:10] blank
[06:40:16] okay
[06:40:20] okay
[06:40:22] boom no okay I thought it would [ __ ] my
[06:40:24] HP but I lo oh my God that's so [ __ ]
[06:40:27] that's
[06:40:30] fine
[06:40:32] enhance
[06:40:36] enhance that's fine that's actually good
[06:40:40] that is [ __ ] you oh that's it
[06:40:47] whatever that was uh not the wisest of
[06:40:51] choices uh immediately copy give
[06:40:54] me wait I don't want to lose rest can
[06:40:57] can you lose respite no way right if I
[06:41:00] copy this it goes there right there's no
[06:41:02] way you can lose [ __ ] resp
[06:41:03] fight yes you can bro
[06:41:08] what that is so
[06:41:19] cringe that is so
[06:41:32] cringe
[06:41:36] this thing sometimes I miss one of them
[06:41:38] and then I I'm like one off so surely
[06:41:40] that doesn't
[06:41:47] happen wait I don't have a technique
[06:41:49] Point wait yo I don't have a technique
[06:41:57] Point can we still celebrate the fact
[06:42:00] that Ito best boy in the
[06:42:02] game
[06:42:04] [Music]
[06:42:08] give
[06:42:09] meths myy
[06:42:12] to stop
[06:42:20] yapping no I [ __ ] missed oh I got it
[06:42:24] it's fine
[06:42:27] chill he was
[06:42:31] gaming uh reduce damage taken
[06:42:35] ooh that's useless wait how many am I
[06:42:39] going to get let me see when characters
[06:42:42] are hit or lose HP they gain four Stacks
[06:42:44] when the turn ends they lose four Stacks
[06:42:46] wait I only gain
[06:42:59] four not if you upgrade it or get hit
[06:43:02] often I mean I mean like if yeah I mean
[06:43:05] this looks
[06:43:09] good it's 35 wait do I have the other
[06:43:12] one do I have the 35 one that's a
[06:43:13] different five star or like a golden
[06:43:15] blessing do I have
[06:43:25] it I mean like I could get hit multiple
[06:43:29] times it Stacks at 35 yeah but like that
[06:43:31] implies destru characters that
[06:43:33] manipulate their HP or you get hit
[06:43:35] multiple times I mean fuan
[06:43:38] like yeah I mean I guess it could stock
[06:43:40] on her I'm
[06:43:48] [Music]
[06:43:49] down I mean this is Advanced forward
[06:44:01] right oh
[06:44:05] POG that was really
[06:44:12] good for each stack of fighting Spirit
[06:44:15] the character deals additional damage I
[06:44:17] don't
[06:44:18] care that's actually not even bad that's
[06:44:22] fine that's good
[06:44:25] uh okay it's one or two I mean no it's
[06:44:28] definitely two this is a lot of [ __ ]
[06:44:30] damage if I Al twice no I need it
[06:44:38] there's no downside the the destruction
[06:44:40] level is only three
[06:44:41] right well I don't even know what this
[06:44:43] does is there even a benefit to going to
[06:44:45] [ __ ] intro
[06:44:50] cognition yeah it's chill what the [ __ ]
[06:44:53] does that
[06:44:56] mean let's go
[06:44:59] here not anymore is
[06:45:01] he
[06:45:19] all right her up upgrade my [ __ ] for
[06:45:23] me
[06:45:27] um dude Shield is like huge but the
[06:45:31] fighting Spirit things the fighting
[06:45:32] stack things might be
[06:45:37] good I don't think we're getting that
[06:45:39] many that's not ever happening what does
[06:45:41] this do four stacks and adjacent allies
[06:45:44] gain one
[06:45:45] stack I kind of like
[06:45:48] that
[06:45:50] no that's a decent amount of
[06:45:54] damage oh yeah we should probably get
[06:45:56] these [ __ ] charging ones wait a
[06:45:59] second dealing fail damage 50% when the
[06:46:02] brain ofat is fully charge increase
[06:46:03] speed I mean that's speed does this one
[06:46:06] charge faster 65
[06:46:08] 35 oh okay this
[06:46:14] is yeah
[06:46:19] okay this is really good too
[06:46:22] uh [ __ ] I kind of want some sustain
[06:46:25] though like some sustain upgrades just
[06:46:27] so I don't [ __ ] die but we maybe we
[06:46:29] just kill it before it kills us whatever
[06:46:31] we're fighting
[06:46:33] [Music]
[06:46:38] uh yeah I really like this
[06:46:42] one but if we do a
[06:46:47] 160 I mean yeah it actually works out
[06:46:49] really well if we do
[06:46:55] 160 Elation this is a big damage
[06:46:58] increase too cuz that's our alt damage
[06:46:59] so it goes from 15 bonus to 55 so I
[06:47:07] 100 left bro do 360 minus 160 right
[06:47:17] now the problem is it's it's a lot more
[06:47:20] efficient if I do a gold and then two uh
[06:47:23] uh like these gray ones like just
[06:47:25] MoneyWise does it actually do much let's
[06:47:27] see so 7% time 6 that's I can't math 42%
[06:47:32] damage versus 10 * 9 which is 990 42 to
[06:47:35] 90 that's like okay that's more
[06:47:38] efficient than doing this right cuz this
[06:47:39] is just it's the same buff basically and
[06:47:42] it costs way less so we'd rather do
[06:47:47] this trouge and then we do this one
[06:47:51] trouge and then we have another uh gray
[06:47:53] one for
[06:47:57] free Na math Wait no that's actually
[06:48:00] like true cuz this is 40% right 15 to 55
[06:48:03] that's 40 this one was uh where was that
[06:48:06] one I just enhanced
[06:48:08] this whatever it's like from 42 to 90
[06:48:11] which is more than 40 it's like
[06:48:13] 48 so I think it was
[06:48:18] better and it was cheaper so it's just
[06:48:20] like objectively better okay uh no I
[06:48:23] mean maybe I I kind of want I dude I
[06:48:26] feel
[06:48:26] like okay let's see that's not happening
[06:48:29] [ __ ] that that's also not happening [ __ ]
[06:48:32] that that so there's three
[06:48:34] left crit damage it seems just worse
[06:48:37] than this if I'm alting twice in a row
[06:48:38] wait I mean is it even worse that's 15%
[06:48:41] that's 25% but this is only good if I Al
[06:48:44] twice in a row if I Al and then skill it
[06:48:46] doesn't actually do
[06:48:48] anything what does this one do defense
[06:48:50] by 30% defense by
[06:48:53] 40% I kind of liked
[06:49:01] it
[06:49:03] maybe we just go
[06:49:11] defense all right dude I think we're
[06:49:13] [ __ ] loaded I think we're actually
[06:49:16] loaded so I need the one that helps me
[06:49:18] in combat right the blue one there you
[06:49:20] go that's the only one that helps me in
[06:49:21] combat I think right how do I check my
[06:49:23] [ __ ] uh this
[06:49:26] one
[06:49:28] yes right yeah yeah
[06:49:33] yeah yeah
[06:49:42] okay okay well none of these are weak to
[06:49:44] lightning in the third plane remove the
[06:49:47] effect of
[06:49:48] abundance in the third
[06:49:50] plane enemies actions are delayed a
[06:49:53] further 50% when their weakness broken
[06:49:55] wait that looks good also I feel
[06:50:01] like
[06:50:04] the minions debuff him yeah I feel like
[06:50:06] this is good for us right cuz we're
[06:50:09] [Music]
[06:50:12] AOE already J I mean swarm is also not
[06:50:17] bad for
[06:50:22] AOE honestly wait I could I could
[06:50:25] actually see myself doing either neither
[06:50:27] of them resists lightning
[06:50:30] right I wish I could check
[06:50:39] B like okay cuz if if swarm mitosis is
[06:50:42] if it chat plink oh no what's the about
[06:50:45] hamis right now if it hamis is acon just
[06:50:48] kills all of
[06:50:49] them bug explosions give you all
[06:50:53] Stacks that is a good point too actually
[06:50:56] right cuz they apply a debuff I
[06:51:01] assume
[06:51:03] I think I actually believe I could beat
[06:51:05] both of them removing abundance is
[06:51:07] probably pretty decent
[06:51:16] right chat seems more afraid of Argy
[06:51:18] than Of Swarm so maybe we'll just do
[06:51:31] swarm
[06:51:36] yeah also with the team we're
[06:51:40] running yeah with the team are running
[06:51:42] silver wolf always implants lightning
[06:51:44] here that's actually true although it's
[06:51:47] it's 50/50 here
[06:51:50] but okay we'll do
[06:52:01] for I I need I need water one sec chat
[06:52:04] give me a second I I've earned it okay
[06:52:06] give me a
[06:52:31] second
[06:52:42] [Music]
[06:53:02] I
[06:53:31] ah

[06:54:17] [Music]
[06:54:31] h
[06:54:47] [Music]
[06:54:53] scatter okay I realized I should
[06:54:55] probably stop yelling cuz it's [ __ ] 6
[06:54:56] a.m. but I mean the damage has already
[06:54:59] been done why do I have no energy on any
[06:55:01] character by the way
[06:55:03] Storm's on the
[06:55:17] horizon big
[06:55:21] Lotto

[06:55:28] been long enough oh
[06:55:31] [ __ ] yo my mic just bro my mic
[06:55:37] just okay maybe that's a sign not to add
[06:55:47] xdd wait one sec I have to unplug

[06:57:19] dude [ __ ] lra I actually I don't know
[06:57:20] maybe we should but like I love lra I'm
[06:57:23] I'm a Lua rid or dire I think he's
[06:57:25] insane but for [ __ ] golden gears like
[06:57:27] I dude I like I don't need healing I
[06:57:30] need [ __ ] protection
[06:57:32] he heals me but if I get one shot I get
[06:57:34] one
[06:57:38] shot the cleanse oh I guess he does give
[06:57:41] a cleanse but
[06:57:53] like should we Gamba is up to you
[06:58:01] mod you don't need no cleanse if you get
[06:58:03] one
[06:58:05] shot says Ting yun's cracked
[06:58:11] neck I think we need damage I'm going to
[06:58:13] be
[06:58:18] honest might need to be cringe and
[06:58:20] double sustain I feel like I double
[06:58:22] sustain a lot but I also think that like
[06:58:25] if I just have enough damage I just kill
[06:58:27] everything before I get
[06:58:30] hit and I feel like acon as a
[06:58:33] unit I don't like without two good
[06:58:36] supports like double sustain I'd rather
[06:58:38] play Argent cuz like dude if I'm not
[06:58:40] applying debuffs how the [ __ ] do I do
[06:58:42] anything on her for
[06:58:57] service just get

[06:59:13] [ __ ] you swarm imagine I lost like three
[06:59:15] times the or two times to yaning and
[06:59:17] then I first try swarm I think that's
[06:59:18] what's about to
[06:59:20] happen no we're about to show the true
[06:59:23] power of
[06:59:25] acaron skill nice uh I'm going to basic

[06:59:49] is what it
[06:59:53] is 2.7 million why are you guys laughing
[06:59:56] at my damage I also didn't even silver
[06:59:57] wolf Al which would have skyrocketed it
[06:59:59] I think I don't know actually maybe his
[07:00:02] defense is already super
[07:00:04] shredded 40 41 15 yeah it would have
[07:00:09] helped enemy targets
[07:00:12] detected uh I'm going to
[07:00:18] skill okay uh nobody asked plus no one
[07:00:22] cares plus your short plus ratio uh I
