[00:10:01] tweeted about it but I didn't get to
[00:10:02] talk about it
[00:10:04] um so we'll talk about it but one thing
[00:10:06] at a time first to those who are here
[00:10:09] early and who care
[00:10:10] sorry for being a bit
[00:10:12] behind on streams I'll make it up to you
[00:10:14] guys I'm streaming Genji now and then
[00:10:15] Kafka starrail literally right after
[00:10:18] like I'm gonna nap then Kafka as on the
[00:10:21] n a release I've had I've been a bit
[00:10:23] dead recently a lot of [ __ ] has come up
[00:10:24] so I didn't really feel like streaming
[00:10:25] well it's not that I didn't feel like I
[00:10:27] just didn't have time all good
[00:10:29] um new videos are coming as well though
[00:10:31] uh though I made a set review
[00:10:33] so that's fully recorded I just need to
[00:10:34] upload it uh I just have the trims
[00:10:36] himself because
[00:10:39] I low-key was expecting them to talk
[00:10:41] about the new sets
[00:10:43] when we see like I was expecting okay
[00:10:46] I'll know what the new sets do as soon
[00:10:48] as there's the trailer that we're I'm
[00:10:49] streaming so I figured they would just
[00:10:51] announce them but they did it and then I
[00:10:52] found it later it's all good
[00:10:55] it's all good
[00:10:58] um but I will release my guide also the
[00:11:01] problem is can I open my editing
[00:11:02] software
[00:11:05] uh sure
[00:11:07] so I talked about Xiao for so [ __ ]
[00:11:11] long that I have to trim this before I
[00:11:13] can upload it the rest is done I just
[00:11:14] need to trim it like I talk about child
[00:11:15] for this [ __ ] long so I'm gonna have
[00:11:18] to like cut it a little
[00:11:20] um
[00:11:21] basically
[00:11:23] because I I don't like here's what's
[00:11:26] [ __ ] okay xiaoman's that watch all of
[00:11:28] this will be like oh thanks for all the
[00:11:29] info but for like 90 like eight percent
[00:11:31] of people just goes up like it like
[00:11:34] strong box per million or like we'll
[00:11:36] talk about it but it's basically the
[00:11:37] same thing I even talked to the Jeff
[00:11:39] about it it's basically the same [ __ ]
[00:11:40] thing which is annoying but it's fine
[00:11:43] it's okay it's like it depends like if
[00:11:46] you're running like if you're running C6
[00:11:48] farzan with Bennett
[00:11:50] which set is better depends on if you
[00:11:52] have more attack or crit sub stats but
[00:11:54] like who's gonna if you care that much
[00:11:56] then
[00:11:58] it's just like strongbox a million
[00:12:00] probably it's fine it is what it is
[00:12:04] anyways
[00:12:05] um I care that much I'm the chow mein
[00:12:07] that cares that much anyways

[00:20:10] it's really cool I'm very happy about it
[00:20:11] we can finally hopefully it works well
[00:20:13] we can capture Crystal flies and it is
[00:20:15] what it is and we're very happy someone
[00:20:17] to chat was like oh you're gonna be so
[00:20:18] mad at how it works how do you know it's
[00:20:21] not even out [ __ ] you
[00:20:24] we'll see but it looks cool so I'm hyped
[00:20:27] um and for the bigger news
[00:20:31] oh before actually okay so I use
[00:20:36] a go XLR
[00:20:38] for my audio stuff
[00:20:40] um but unfortunately the USB port on the
[00:20:43] back is like wonky like I have to like
[00:20:46] hold the cable at a certain angle
[00:20:48] and so I the dumbass that I am tried
[00:20:51] [ __ ] with it and it got worse and now
[00:20:53] it doesn't work so I'm using my old
[00:20:56] audio setup I spent like hours like
[00:20:58] fixing the [ __ ] equalizer [ __ ] so
[00:21:00] hopefully it sounds about the same
[00:21:01] uh however
[00:21:04] if it's a bit weird or whatever
[00:21:05] apologize I'm gonna it's still under
[00:21:07] warranty so I'll try to change it get
[00:21:09] the same one again so everything goes
[00:21:11] back to the same
[00:21:12] um but hopefully it sounds like
[00:21:14] basically the same that is the point I
[00:21:16] just don't I'm not gonna pay for another
[00:21:18] one so I'm hoping it's under warranty
[00:21:21] yeah
[00:21:22] so
[00:21:23] now we're gonna talk
[00:21:26] about the new set
[00:21:28] so the new sets now again
[00:21:31] I don't know why
[00:21:38] they didn't announce this during the
[00:21:40] live stream they showed the sets but
[00:21:42] they didn't explain them
[00:21:45] um
[00:21:46] yeah back to using [ __ ] voice meter
[00:21:48] banana now which is scoffed it also
[00:21:50] means I could do
[00:21:52] um
[00:21:53] this fauna sound like I'm at McDonald's
[00:21:55] hey welcome to McDonald's I take your
[00:21:58] order so that's cool
[00:22:03] that's cool anyways
[00:22:06] yep so uh I can also Turn The Equalizer
[00:22:09] off but I think equalizer helps I don't
[00:22:11] know I I don't know I don't really know
[00:22:12] how this audio sounds but I think it's
[00:22:13] fine
[00:22:14] right shot anyways so it might be like
[00:22:16] that for one or two videos that I'm
[00:22:18] recording and then we'll go back to the
[00:22:19] normal
[00:22:20] thanks here she said shut it down hey
[00:22:22] Fang zanger this is tier two again for a
[00:22:25] year damn
[00:22:27] um okay so let's start with the new sets
[00:22:28] let's start with the new sets
[00:22:32] uh let me change webcams to make this
[00:22:34] more professional
[00:22:45] wait why is it so big wait I don't
[00:22:46] remember the size of it wait how big is
[00:22:48] a webcam usually [ __ ] I don't remember
[00:22:50] what if I spam control Z
[00:22:53] okay I'm gonna spam control Z I don't
[00:22:54] know what's gonna happen
[00:22:57] oh
[00:22:59] okay it's stuck here it stuck
[00:23:04] all right whatever uh
[00:23:07] wait how how big is it normally
[00:23:12] wait I remember it usually covers up to
[00:23:14] the map Parts I need to turn out a
[00:23:15] little bit it's usually like
[00:23:18] yeah like this like this
[00:23:21] dude my lighting is so [ __ ] I still
[00:23:23] I'm too lazy to change the light bulb I
[00:23:24] gotta do that today or tomorrow or
[00:23:26] something
[00:23:29] all right at least some scuffed stream
[00:23:32] shut the [ __ ] up
[00:23:36] wait is the size fine
[00:23:38] it's not just about size chat but is it
[00:23:40] okay
[00:23:43] or is it too big
[00:23:50] it used to be about half of what it is
[00:23:52] yo you're capping
[00:23:57] well it's like this right yeah it's
[00:23:59] literally like this
[00:24:02] all right anyways well since our last
[00:24:03] stream there were two new artifacts that
[00:24:06] were announced golden trout B and Murray
[00:24:09] cow C Hunter that's not how you
[00:24:11] pronounce them but that's how I did
[00:24:13] pronounce them uh also since we changed
[00:24:15] our audio setup let me make sure
[00:24:17] that there's no music in the VOD
[00:24:20] AF there is it cool okay so let's talk
[00:24:22] about these I have a fully edited video
[00:24:24] on this it's gonna come out today
[00:24:27] but until then
[00:24:30] here's what you need to know
[00:24:32] first of all
[00:24:37] golden true another [ __ ] Fishel buff
[00:24:40] why
[00:24:42] I like Fishel I love Fishel official's
[00:24:44] great I [ __ ] love visual I love
[00:24:45] Fishel I love Beto I love most electric
[00:24:48] characters I think Electro characters
[00:24:49] are sick
[00:24:50] but officials already like top she's
[00:24:53] already the best electric character I
[00:24:55] don't give a [ __ ] what you say she's
[00:24:55] already the best electric character
[00:24:57] before golden true [ __ ] like to
[00:24:59] act like any new buffed official is what
[00:25:01] made her good oh only good with dendro
[00:25:03] no she was broken before it then she got
[00:25:05] dendro and then she's getting a new set
[00:25:07] for no [ __ ] reason anyways uh golden
[00:25:10] troop is also a globa buff so if you
[00:25:12] plan on playing goba and not Chang Ling
[00:25:14] go golden true anyways so this is
[00:25:17] official buff uh 20 skill damage on the
[00:25:19] 2bs and then the four piece gives you
[00:25:21] another 50 for free so 70 percent
[00:25:26] uh skill damage to your official so
[00:25:27] there you go
[00:25:29] um very [ __ ] good about 15 to 20
[00:25:31] better than her other sets which is a
[00:25:34] lot that is a lot that's more than
[00:25:36] Vermillion
[00:25:38] so
[00:25:39] yeah
[00:25:40] uh
[00:25:43] better than husband Alberto is it yes
[00:25:45] kind of yes and it depends so golden
[00:25:48] troop how it works on Albedo is the
[00:25:50] following if you have the more defense
[00:25:52] you have the better golden troop is the
[00:25:54] less defense the worse it is
[00:25:56] generally if you're an Albedo player in
[00:25:58] Albedo main an Albedo lover and you have
[00:26:00] husk you're good you don't need to farm
[00:26:01] golden but
[00:26:03] husk is Golden's a bit better if you run
[00:26:06] cinebar spindle and Goro which a lot of
[00:26:08] Geo teams do it'll be like six percent I
[00:26:10] think I forgot the exact number but it's
[00:26:12] a little bit better
[00:26:13] but it still subset dependent depends on
[00:26:15] how much like defensive should you have
[00:26:16] with only Cinnabar nogoro I think it's
[00:26:18] like slightly better uh and then without
[00:26:20] both of them then husk becomes better
[00:26:23] both are good
[00:26:24] for yai Mikko it's weird uh it's her
[00:26:28] best set for her skill damage and a lot
[00:26:29] of people play like afki well not a lot
[00:26:31] of people but some people or like you
[00:26:33] don't really care about the rest of your
[00:26:34] kid and you just like skill in a swap
[00:26:36] golden troop will be the best for that
[00:26:38] but for like as a general set on yai
[00:26:40] Gilda dream uh yeah Gilda dreams is
[00:26:42] still going to be the recommended one
[00:26:44] because you also want to use your burst
[00:26:47] which is a big chunk of your damage em
[00:26:48] is really good because you're
[00:26:49] aggravating uh in Denver teams which is
[00:26:51] what I recommend how I reckon playing
[00:26:53] yai and as a driver or even like kind of
[00:26:55] quick swap teams you also normal attack
[00:26:57] you also might charge attack like
[00:26:58] whatever right so Gilda is still her
[00:27:01] General set
[00:27:02] but golden is the best for skill damage
[00:27:04] and it's still good it's still genuinely
[00:27:05] good it's a lot of skill damage uh but
[00:27:07] not good as a driver it's not good if
[00:27:09] you're on Fielding your eye but
[00:27:10] off-field it's good
[00:27:12] uh but gilded is usually more
[00:27:13] recommended
[00:27:15] so it's mainly best it's not for
[00:27:16] official huge facial buff and then also
[00:27:18] good on Albedo also viable on yai also
[00:27:21] good on Daya if you just care about her
[00:27:22] skill uh usually someone emblem but if
[00:27:25] you're just playing her for a skill you
[00:27:26] can go uh golden Troop
[00:27:28] uh and then you can also use it with
[00:27:30] don't use you can also use it on some
[00:27:33] quick swap characters
[00:27:35] um
[00:27:38] you can use it on some quick swap
[00:27:39] characters uh who want skill damage
[00:27:41] actually we'll talk about I'll hide them
[00:27:44] in a second but example let's say you're
[00:27:46] playing Hazel I highly recommend just
[00:27:48] going like Veritas and vener if you're
[00:27:49] playing him in like a taser team or
[00:27:51] whatever his other best installed set is
[00:27:53] for damage but if you're playing quick
[00:27:56] swap Hazel and you don't need of editor
[00:27:58] this
[00:28:00] this [ __ ] out because you got a lot of
[00:28:02] skill damage
[00:28:03] um for a high thumb you might look at it
[00:28:05] be like dude what actually yeah you
[00:28:07] might look at me like why the [ __ ] would
[00:28:08] you run this on a high thumb that's
[00:28:10] stupid as [ __ ] because you get 20 skill
[00:28:12] level doobies great so Baseline a good
[00:28:15] two piece for either if you're going to
[00:28:16] these two bees it's good but why do the
[00:28:18] four piece you only get you get 25 more
[00:28:20] skill damage but then if you're not on
[00:28:21] field you lose that on the other 25.
[00:28:22] true but even at that point I've seen
[00:28:25] math say that it's around as good as
[00:28:27] like two piece two piece maybe a bit
[00:28:29] worse
[00:28:30] but Guild is better or deepwood so it's
[00:28:32] not recommended on high thumb but if you
[00:28:34] don't have a good four piece gilded you
[00:28:36] can either do these two bees or you can
[00:28:37] even four piece the set as like a
[00:28:39] placeholder because it's not that much
[00:28:40] worse than two piece two piece or
[00:28:41] sometimes it's a bit better I think
[00:28:44] um
[00:28:44] yeah so it's still yeah
[00:28:47] mostly I think not I said sync Strokes
[00:28:49] on shots Etc mostly official buff
[00:28:53] um yeah
[00:28:55] now next up foreign Hunter
[00:29:02] here which means a Accent on the E but
[00:29:05] unfortunately it's not there a two
[00:29:06] actually there's one on the E here and
[00:29:08] the E there it's Marie you can't
[00:29:10] pronounce that [ __ ] you I'm kidding it
[00:29:12] doesn't matter Mary shall see I don't
[00:29:13] know how the [ __ ] to say it but yeah the
[00:29:15] hunter said uh pretty weird like I
[00:29:19] genuinely we don't talk about Lisa's
[00:29:20] Channel and I also personally just don't
[00:29:22] look at them
[00:29:23] but
[00:29:24] not about like this is like purely my
[00:29:27] gut feeling this has to be a new Fontan
[00:29:29] character it just has to be because who
[00:29:31] the [ __ ] in this game other than Xiao
[00:29:33] has their HP decrease all the time
[00:29:35] that's only Xiao like who now doesn't
[00:29:37] even do that it's only Xiao so I'm
[00:29:40] assuming it's gonna be a future
[00:29:41] character just like uh like an educated
[00:29:43] guess it has to be it has to be a future
[00:29:45] character we don't know we saw Linney in
[00:29:48] the trailer he's pyro we don't really
[00:29:49] know what he does
[00:29:51] maybe he's like pyroing burgeoning
[00:29:53] himself burning himself there's a chance
[00:29:55] because it's actually not bad for uh
[00:29:57] virgin ayato
[00:29:59] this set message about on version I told
[00:30:01] could be his best set which is kind of
[00:30:04] funny considering Echoes but yeah
[00:30:06] um
[00:30:15] so we'll see
[00:30:20] regarding hutau it doesn't really work
[00:30:23] on her
[00:30:24] um it's like okay the two v's is good
[00:30:26] because it gives you chargeback damage
[00:30:28] and normal and then the Four B's gives
[00:30:30] you 12 crit rate every time you take
[00:30:31] damage right or or heal take damage or
[00:30:33] heal
[00:30:34] the only problem with that was when the
[00:30:36] [ __ ] do you take damage not genuinely
[00:30:38] what are you just standing there and
[00:30:39] letting yourself get hit no so you press
[00:30:42] EU take damage once you burst you heal
[00:30:43] once that's it that's literally it so
[00:30:45] you can do some things of playing a
[00:30:47] virgin team if you're playing hotel
[00:30:48] Virgin You could argue this is a good
[00:30:50] set if you're playing without virgin
[00:30:51] yeah there's probably a good chance your
[00:30:53] HP is decreasing you can probably make
[00:30:55] use of it outside of that
[00:30:58] um you'd only get one of maybe two
[00:31:00] stacks you could run I think there's a
[00:31:02] case to be made if you really want to
[00:31:03] use a set to run like a Healer on dog
[00:31:06] [ __ ] stats like literally uh yeah yeah
[00:31:08] with no artifacts or like a diona burst
[00:31:10] with no art like kokomi e with no
[00:31:12] artifacts and just like slightly heal
[00:31:14] but I don't recommend that uh yeah
[00:31:19] anyways so the main person who outside
[00:31:22] of future characters right I as someone
[00:31:24] a VIP and chat uh pointed out I I
[00:31:27] predicted that Vermillion would be best
[00:31:29] installed on everyone because dang's
[00:31:31] Leaf's gonna come out and he's gonna use
[00:31:32] his void [ __ ] and damage all of your
[00:31:34] party members making Vermillion good
[00:31:36] maybe a font 10 character does that and
[00:31:38] makesho say good that would be [ __ ]
[00:31:41] cool and then I called it so true now
[00:31:43] anyways actually is basically just a
[00:31:46] child set until maybe like Lenny [ __ ]
[00:31:48] Burns himself maybe [ __ ] a new Fontan
[00:31:51] character damages your party like we
[00:31:52] don't know but for the time being this
[00:31:54] is a Xiao set it's literally just a
[00:31:56] [ __ ] shout set and it upset me when I
[00:31:58] found out I wish I literally was waiting
[00:32:00] for stream so that I could see the new
[00:32:02] sets on stream and react to them on
[00:32:03] stream but then they they literally
[00:32:05] tweeted about them at like midnight
[00:32:06] randomly so didn't reveal it on Stream
[00:32:09] So my reaction has not been recorded but
[00:32:13] [ __ ] this game
[00:32:17] um now I see a lot of look
[00:32:20] there I've done so there has been I've
[00:32:23] seen literally a bucket load of math
[00:32:26] about the set I've seen what the Jeff
[00:32:27] has done I've seen what xiaomanes have
[00:32:29] done I've talked to people in
[00:32:31] Charlemagne's I've talked to the Jeff
[00:32:33] I've looked at it myself
[00:32:38] listen
[00:32:39] for most people
[00:32:41] it's just another set
[00:32:44] um and the the the the difference
[00:32:47] between Vermilion and marriage is very
[00:32:50] minimal
[00:32:51] but it can be not minimal depending on
[00:32:54] what you're running for example if you
[00:32:56] have a ton of attack you're running
[00:32:58] [ __ ] Vortex vanquisher because you
[00:33:00] suck no I'm kidding because you you got
[00:33:01] it somehow or Calamity queller and
[00:33:03] you're using Bennett you have a [ __ ] ton
[00:33:05] of attack might actually will be like
[00:33:06] seven percent better or like 10 like
[00:33:08] it'll actually be quite a bit better
[00:33:10] on the contrary you have a lot of crit
[00:33:12] rate Xiao is a crit Ascension passive
[00:33:13] you're running Death Match you have
[00:33:15] farzan who gives you damage
[00:33:18] Vermillion will be a lot better so not a
[00:33:20] lot it's still usually small but
[00:33:23] they're both about as good now there's
[00:33:26] cases to be made for both so for my
[00:33:28] initial say the case is hey you get a
[00:33:30] lot of crate easier to build it comes
[00:33:31] with a set that isn't Echoes which is a
[00:33:34] waste of your entire life so you might
[00:33:36] just build it passively on your show
[00:33:38] true
[00:33:40] the contrary is vermilion is now being
[00:33:42] added to the strong box
[00:33:43] so it's in my opinion more efficient to
[00:33:47] strongbox Vermilion for chow unless you
[00:33:50] also want golden true which is
[00:33:52] worthwhile for officials or best in slot
[00:33:54] stop diving minus 100K stop then you can
[00:33:58] go for uh say on your shout both of them
[00:34:01] are fine now when one becomes better
[00:34:03] than the other depends on your supports
[00:34:04] and your weapon so if you're running
[00:34:06] Bennett Madison is better if you're
[00:34:08] running fars on vermilion's better if
[00:34:09] you're running both very [ __ ] close
[00:34:12] especially with C6 farzan to where you
[00:34:14] go based on sub stats you go based on
[00:34:16] what's easier for you to farm
[00:34:18] is easier for you to get a good ratio
[00:34:21] because it gives you a bunch of crit
[00:34:22] rate but it's also harder to build
[00:34:23] because
[00:34:25] uh you get a [ __ ] ton of crit rate so
[00:34:28] you don't want any more crate so you
[00:34:30] want attack crit damage kind of like an
[00:34:31] ayaka it's not like hard to build ICA
[00:34:33] it's just you don't really want crit
[00:34:35] rate anymore so you might overcap
[00:34:37] especially if you're running like death
[00:34:38] match or Jade spear it depends if you're
[00:34:40] running like Homa you're probably fine
[00:34:41] but yeah
[00:34:45] um also
[00:34:50] skill doesn't create I mean yeah but you
[00:34:52] also get normal and chargeback damage
[00:34:54] which people usually don't calc
[00:34:56] um because a lot of shallows don't know
[00:34:58] how to normal plunge without missing a
[00:35:00] plunge with a normal cancel it but if
[00:35:02] you are playing optimally you get more
[00:35:03] value and then it's also like a higher
[00:35:05] investment Vermillion can be a little
[00:35:06] bit better because you have a [ __ ] on
[00:35:08] a crit but maybe you didn't already farm
[00:35:09] for it and then you're farming for a new
[00:35:10] set or you could just go for a [ __ ]
[00:35:11] out of attack and then like they're both
[00:35:14] good okay all of this like I'm telling
[00:35:16] you I recorded for way too long talking
[00:35:18] about ciao like genuinely way too long
[00:35:20] okay so
[00:35:21] I'm gonna trim it but most people don't
[00:35:23] need to know all that information just
[00:35:24] keep in mind
[00:35:26] both are good uh and
[00:35:30] I am trying not to mold because I was
[00:35:33] very afraid that would be better than
[00:35:35] Vermillion now I know that it's about as
[00:35:37] good which means I can keep farming
[00:35:38] Vermillion but I also know that I want
[00:35:41] golden troop because I [ __ ] love
[00:35:42] Fishel and I like yaimiko but she
[00:35:44] doesn't need it she can use gilded it's
[00:35:45] probably better overall
[00:35:47] um but I just want a golden troop set so
[00:35:49] I'm gonna have to farm this domain
[00:35:50] uh but vermilion's now coming to the
[00:35:52] strong box which means that if you farm
[00:35:54] Vermilion before the strong box you are
[00:35:57] why because you can just strong box it
[00:35:59] now so I'm at a point where my life is a
[00:36:03] comedy I used to think it was a tragedy
[00:36:05] but so I yeah I don't know what to do
[00:36:09] but I mean I'm probably just gonna
[00:36:11] strong box for a million uh and part of
[00:36:13] this set
[00:36:16] the fact that Vermilion goes to
[00:36:17] strongbox is really good really really
[00:36:19] good for charmains
[00:36:21] but the fact that there's
[00:36:23] yeah yeah
[00:36:25] um I don't know I will have to see
[00:36:27] foreign
[00:36:39] what if I what if I do this set and then
[00:36:42] I strong what if I do Vermillion and
[00:36:43] then I strong box more Vermillion
[00:36:54] so yeah it's uh it's a thing what's your
[00:36:57] current oh yeah my current official
[00:36:59] build is insane by the way my official
[00:37:00] right now is insane and I'm gonna have
[00:37:02] to [ __ ] throw it away last Christmas
[00:37:05] you gave me your heart my heart I gave
[00:37:07] you very next day okay like look at this
[00:37:10] Vermillion I can't be using her anymore
[00:37:12] literally can't even use it on her the
[00:37:13] news has like 20 better
[00:37:15] why not for Nikita gilded troop because
[00:37:17] deepwood
[00:37:20] Nikita brings more value to your team
[00:37:23] outside on not just skill damage like
[00:37:26] Em's really good for her em Buffs your
[00:37:27] team as well so even like Gilda dreams
[00:37:29] at that point
[00:37:41] foreign
[00:37:57] I'm going to see if I get better than
[00:37:59] Vermillion in there and then decide if I
[00:38:02] go Malaysia or if I go for a million
[00:38:04] with that in mind
[00:38:07] if I go Jade ciao like usually it's
[00:38:11] gonna be weird building that set
[00:38:13] because I usually have a lot of crit
[00:38:14] rate like regardless of yeah
[00:38:17] it's hard to not have a lot I don't know
[00:38:19] we'll see I will see uh because
[00:38:25] what is it it's 22 from Jade 24 base
[00:38:28] because it's 19 plus five so what was
[00:38:30] that 24 plus 22 plus another [ __ ] 12
[00:38:33] times 3 which is 36.
[00:38:39] so yeah
[00:38:41] um
[00:38:43] what if I go staff with the Scarlet Sans
[00:38:46] 44.
[00:38:49] just use Vertex or Homa yeah well
[00:38:51] probably not Vortex because we're gonna
[00:38:52] run Bennett but we could do homo
[00:39:06] wait how much was that I didn't count 22
[00:39:08] plus 24 is 46 plus 36 right
[00:39:14] like 82 or some [ __ ]
[00:39:25] yeah it's a lot
[00:39:27] but then what if you're on death match
[00:39:29] if you're on death box that's that's
[00:39:31] Plus 14.
[00:39:35] dude if you're on Deathmatch you're
[00:39:37] literally like 100 criterate
[00:39:39] that's more than Aika
[00:39:53] worthless
[00:40:01] are you fine I can't move by the way I
[00:40:04] literally cannot move I'm stuck until
[00:40:06] this or breaks
[00:40:08] all right well he's pole dancing
[00:40:13] oh okay well
[00:40:20] thanks y'all thank you
[00:40:32] strongest child team this one but no
[00:40:34] Daya
[00:40:35] you play like Toma or zhangri or
[00:40:38] something or a third of Nemo
[00:40:46] is it good for crit Comey
[00:40:50] wait actually though wait a second wait
[00:40:53] a second I mean okay uh you I mean maybe
[00:40:57] you probably still want to go blizzard
[00:40:59] sprayer but you get normal and charge
[00:41:00] attack damage here maybe for like
[00:41:04] wait let me cook if you can like make
[00:41:07] sure your HP goes up and down because
[00:41:09] you are a Healer
[00:41:12] like you're a Healer so as long as
[00:41:13] you're getting hit but I don't know if
[00:41:14] you will get hit virgin true you can do
[00:41:17] Persian could Comey that's true or just
[00:41:19] bloom
[00:41:24] true actually that's a good take
[00:41:35] I don't know why I'm mining but we're
[00:41:37] mining gotta get ready for font 10.
[00:41:49] uh wait where is it
[00:42:03] or how much yam can I have
[00:42:19] um
[00:42:25] where's flop
[00:42:31] oh chat wait did you guys not know if
[00:42:34] you play a [ __ ] bloom or hyperloom
[00:42:36] team uh with the next patch that's
[00:42:38] coming out or dispatch 3.8 I think uh
[00:42:41] you get one resin per point of Elemental
[00:42:43] Mastery on your highest em character so
[00:42:46] I actually claimed that today I didn't
[00:42:48] know I could claim it and I got 1050 em
[00:42:50] uh resin I had one so now I have exactly
[00:42:53] 1050 where my cookie literally has
[00:42:56] exactly 1050 uh em as you guys can see
[00:42:58] so it's true I can't make this up how
[00:43:01] would I know exactly how much am I
[00:43:02] claimed so that's a true story you guys
[00:43:04] can do that too if you want by the way
[00:43:06] so if you guys want to do that feel free
[00:43:08] to claim you're a free resin uh based on
[00:43:10] how much game you have so that's true
[00:43:12] actually
[00:43:20] uh Jean Lee is generally better than
[00:43:21] Tomah here but since you have C6 fars on
[00:43:24] farzan can use millith and as far as not
[00:43:26] uses millith then Zhang Lee can use
[00:43:28] millith so Tomah can be better if Tomo
[00:43:30] C6 because he gives you punch attack
[00:43:31] damage
[00:43:32] and you get power resonance
[00:43:34] so yeah that's why Mr Thomas can
[00:43:37] actually be a little bit better
[00:43:39] but they're both fine like they're both
[00:43:40] still fine you can just play whichever
[00:43:42] one you want
[00:43:44] what's that with Tomo Beyond honestly it
[00:43:46] doesn't matter
[00:43:47] emblem probably probably emblem but you
[00:43:49] can do whatever
[00:43:51] do you have medication why would I need
[00:43:53] that
[00:43:55] why would I need that
[00:43:57] I haven't played Genji in so long I feel
[00:43:58] bad
[00:44:00] I miss it
[00:44:10] why does NA get Kafka late because we're
[00:44:12] hated
[00:44:14] you know there's literally no reason not
[00:44:16] to make a Asia account on cereal ping
[00:44:17] doesn't matter in that game just [ __ ]
[00:44:18] make an Asia account I don't know why I
[00:44:20] made any I actually regret it
[00:44:23] like on ironic it's like you play with
[00:44:25] friends there's no [ __ ] Co-op so like
[00:44:43] I'm sorry I was chatting people chatting
[00:44:53] foreign
[00:44:59] so hard to farm oh aware
[00:45:05] oh no a new Spectra farmer oh where did
[00:45:09] inspectors used to be even worse too
[00:45:12] but I expect just [ __ ] suck
[00:45:24] are you rolling for mommy streamer yes
[00:45:28] uh so here's how this is gonna work
[00:45:30] we're gonna work engineering today
[00:45:31] but we're also star railing today so
[00:45:33] what I'm gonna do is the following we're
[00:45:36] going to play against it back do all the
[00:45:37] [ __ ] we gotta do then
[00:45:39] I was initially gonna stream Kafka on
[00:45:41] Asia release but I thought Asia release
[00:45:43] was 6 a.m because that's like normal for
[00:45:45] I think genshin or I don't know but it's
[00:45:47] [ __ ] 12 for some reason I thought it
[00:45:49] was 6 a.m so I was gonna gentian and
[00:45:52] then Boron Asia count but since she's
[00:45:53] out now what we're going to do is get it
[00:45:56] then I end stream record some Kafka
[00:45:58] stuff off stream on
[00:46:01] my friends Asia account then we stream
[00:46:03] the n a release on my main account
[00:46:08] uh because we're waiting for a new
[00:46:09] release because I'm an n a player sag
[00:46:12] despair
[00:46:19] so that's the plan
[00:46:21] uh the only thing is since I wasn't
[00:46:23] planning on using my account for Kafka I
[00:46:27] didn't actually fully pre-farm now I
[00:46:28] pre-farmed for Kafka but I also want to
[00:46:31] use like sampo or Luca or whatever the
[00:46:34] [ __ ]
[00:46:35] uh and I want to level a lycone so I'm
[00:46:38] gonna have to use like I'm gonna have to
[00:46:40] search him like three hours early and
[00:46:41] spam my [ __ ] fragile resin that's all
[00:46:44] good
[00:46:48] another Co-op off
[00:46:58] Chad Fang asked me if she wants me to
[00:47:01] pull if she if she can pull for my Kafka
[00:47:04] tomorrow because she's gonna be
[00:47:05] cosplaying Kafka but I feel like she's
[00:47:07] not lucky so I don't know what to say
[00:47:09] how do I answer this
[00:47:12] without losing all of my money
[00:47:17] yes
[00:47:19] oh [ __ ] she's here hey Fang hey hey
[00:47:26] to be lucky to be fair your story lock
[00:47:28] has been [ __ ] after
[00:47:30] you got Sealy yeah true wait can you
[00:47:32] guys remind me what happened with Celie
[00:47:33] I forgot
[00:47:35] how many polls did I do for Sealy again
[00:47:42] true
[00:47:48] sorry guys Dale's getting above
[00:47:57] speaking of fang Fang tweeted [ __ ] um
[00:48:00] she did it like
[00:48:02] hey guys I'm trying to see something
[00:48:03] name your favorite character from every
[00:48:05] region and I was thinking about it did I
[00:48:07] literally couldn't decide so I just said
[00:48:09] child for a region because he's [ __ ]
[00:48:10] Mr worldwide and shows up everywhere but
[00:48:13] I actually don't know like okay
[00:48:14] obviously shout for the UA right
[00:48:16] obviously obviously Xiao ciao ciao but
[00:48:19] for the other reasons I don't know like
[00:48:20] Subaru I think it's all haitham but I
[00:48:22] also like Daya I also like Sino
[00:48:25] like it's probably I'll hide them but I
[00:48:27] also like there's other characters I
[00:48:29] really like too and then
[00:48:31] for months that month that's really hard
[00:48:33] monster is probably the hardest because
[00:48:35] Mazda has
[00:48:37] Masa has deluke who is my OG main I
[00:48:40] loved Luke but I also really like Fishel
[00:48:42] I think she's cool and I like Ozzy Chad
[00:48:44] and then I also like Kaya but I don't
[00:48:46] know if Kaya's conoria
[00:48:50] or if he's monstat
[00:48:54] so Eddie there's a 12 months
[00:48:56] got to turn off auto renewal [ __ ] you
[00:48:58] fast I literally don't know yeah itazu
[00:49:00] was probably kokomi uh because I'm a
[00:49:02] kokomi fan I love fish
[00:49:05] with that said I also really like uh the
[00:49:09] electro characters I like Ryden and ndi
[00:49:11] a lot
[00:49:13] but when I was thinking about like it is
[00:49:15] when I was thinking about this I noticed
[00:49:17] for someone who really likes Ryden I
[00:49:19] never [ __ ] play her and the reason I
[00:49:21] know players because I got her C2 which
[00:49:23] makes me not want to use her because
[00:49:24] then everything like Pepe wc2 but I
[00:49:26] still think I should play her because
[00:49:27] she's on two Ocean View Clan right now
[00:49:29] and it's low-key disrespectful so yeah
[00:49:33] Murphy but yeah I think it is
[00:49:37] Albedo and then Masa I don't [ __ ]
[00:49:39] know
[00:49:42] patui I also don't know I like all the
[00:49:44] fatou's I guess it depends on how like
[00:49:46] who's playable
[00:49:49] wait did I say Albedo wait I'll I'll
[00:49:52] hide them [ __ ] yeah
[00:49:58] what the [ __ ] did I say Albedo
[00:50:09] I just remembered that time when Chichi
[00:50:12] was considered on
[00:50:14] yeah I mean to be fair early game when
[00:50:17] all you care about is healing and you
[00:50:19] don't know how particles work Gucci does
[00:50:20] seem pretty good
[00:50:29] Albedo likers have zero wins since
[00:50:32] release uh that's not true Albedo
[00:50:34] synergizes with Geo characters and since
[00:50:36] Albedo's rerun we got a bunch of Geo
[00:50:38] characters the Geo regions coming soon
[00:50:40] we're getting a ton of Geo characters so
[00:50:42] don't worry Albedo means also your best
[00:50:44] in slot weapon is from an event so it's
[00:50:46] free to play but you have to have played
[00:50:48] like over a year ago to get it so that
[00:50:49] that's a win for Albert that's a win hey
[00:50:52] if you played a year ago uh that's a win
[00:50:54] what's another win what's another one
[00:50:56] um uh Huss comes with ocean huge Clan
[00:50:58] which is [ __ ] uh a set
[00:51:01] so there you go
[00:51:09] Kafka trailer oh yeah we could watch
[00:51:10] like I didn't watch the Kafka trailer we
[00:51:12] could watch it I kind of want to uncut
[00:51:13] my resin but we can watch a trailer
[00:51:14] first sure sure
[00:51:36] I'm gonna skip to the middle okay

[00:51:51] start of the stream what the [ __ ] is

[00:56:42] yeah that was like your lawn trailer
[00:56:43] core kind of but I liked it I think more
[00:56:45] because the violin was kind of hard and
[00:56:47] then it was also Fontan core because it
[00:56:49] said it funny it's which means end in
[00:56:50] French over here
[00:56:54] I guess that other words but I can't
[00:56:55] read other languages so
[00:57:02] yeah I like her
[00:57:04] a lot she's probably
[00:57:10] and I also I usually don't like
[00:57:13] characters that just use like miniguns
[00:57:14] or like guns in this sword okay I think
[00:57:17] guns are the least cool thing by far
[00:57:19] least cool Weapon by far it's not even
[00:57:21] close if there's also like swords and
[00:57:24] bows and [ __ ] in a game not even [ __ ]
[00:57:26] close literally not even close but she
[00:57:28] also has a sword and like [ __ ] webs
[00:57:31] which is sick so yeah
[00:57:36] thank you
[00:57:42] bronya is sick
[00:57:44] I like brania but bronya dude Brian has
[00:57:47] all this the silver main guards and then
[00:57:50] she's just like
[00:57:51] like she could be cool bro is cool but
[00:57:54] if Brian had a cool like a cooler weapon
[00:57:56] it would be even cooler
[00:57:58] so
[00:58:02] watch her Bounty oh a pill saying watch
[00:58:05] the JP one how do I find that
[00:58:10] uh Kafka JP trailer
[00:58:15] every time I look at oh I found it wait
[00:58:17] is this it
[00:58:19] this looks official right
[00:58:21] wait why is it in English though if the
[00:58:24] oh yeah it is
[00:58:45] okay wow all right
[00:58:51] that was that was bait
[00:59:00] thank you
[00:59:03] moment of silence for free to play
[00:59:05] players who have to stay strong and hope
[00:59:07] they win the 50 50. I sincerely hope you
[00:59:10] don't see bailu or anyone else outside
[00:59:13] of Kafka my prayers go out to you after
[00:59:16] seeing this trailer
[00:59:32] foreign
[00:59:42] top two characters in this patch
[00:59:46] but like that sounds bad but blade and
[00:59:48] cap probably my favorite so it's better
[00:59:50] than the towns
[01:00:15] yeah I mean I like I like her voices
[01:00:18] I think they're both good
[01:00:20] bye
[01:00:36] I hate this game I hate it
[01:00:42] yeah Kafka is is is in a non-biased way
[01:00:46] very very Peak
[01:00:50] but she also has a lot of web design
[01:00:51] which I like
[01:00:53] I was a filthy Elise player when I
[01:00:55] played League well I made kha'zix but I
[01:00:57] also played at least so
[01:00:58] I don't know Kafka awakens that in me
[01:01:01] anyways
[01:01:05] uh yeah this is uh this is something
[01:01:19] Lee's down bad Kafka main someone said
[01:01:23] she can heal the enemies at this point I
[01:01:25] do not care holy flushed
[01:01:28] dude
[01:01:30] dude yeah maybe you should you have to
[01:01:33] see what she does first
[01:01:35] oh she's out now right so I can say it
[01:01:37] oh yeah she she's pretty good well I
[01:01:38] don't know actually I need to test her
[01:01:40] myself but
[01:01:41] you play on like D.O.T teams so you
[01:01:43] usually want to play with like sampler
[01:01:44] Luca then you just like buff the dot
[01:01:46] damage they take that's how it works
[01:01:48] and you do um
[01:01:50] it's a very unique build though which I
[01:01:52] don't like well I mean I guess it's not
[01:01:54] a bad thing
[01:01:55] because it's easier to build kind of but
[01:01:57] you don't really want crit you want like
[01:01:58] attack and speed
[01:02:00] but I'm gonna make a video on it
[01:02:01] probably so
[01:02:03] stay tuned for the guide
[01:02:07] oh
[01:02:12] okay
[01:02:16] that was cool I like Kafka
[01:02:19] that hung will be better dude listen
[01:02:21] here bucko at some point star rail
[01:02:25] designs have to fall off because there's
[01:02:27] no way they release blade Kafka and then
[01:02:30] hung too and then still keep going hard
[01:02:32] so those three are like my top three
[01:02:35] we'll see
[01:02:44] Liu I forget oh yeah that's that girl
[01:02:47] from the trailer or something like the
[01:02:49] the genuine one I know that slice's name
[01:02:52] on RuneScape
[01:02:53] we have a group Iron Man Misa Jeff
[01:02:56] ontsun slice and slices jingliu I'm dad
[01:02:59] Hong
[01:03:00] uh autism and then
[01:03:03] Alexa Jeff is uh atsu's balls
[01:03:08] so we're all star rail characters except
[01:03:10] the draft
[01:03:11] for some reason
[01:03:13] I don't know why
[01:03:31] you're using the yanching story Quest oh
[01:03:34] I should do yanching starcast but I
[01:03:36] don't really I don't know
[01:03:46] uh no but I can check you ready I only
[01:03:49] have like three friends on Star rail
[01:03:51] look look this is how you check
[01:03:55] I'm about to find out right now friends
[01:03:58] Kayla's that's his name I don't know why
[01:04:00] 52 days ago
[01:04:03] so this is our mod Panda Bing Bong who
[01:04:05] spams gambas
[01:04:06] [ __ ] you dumb loser
[01:04:13] wow that was mean
[01:04:15] sorry
[01:04:17] sorry I didn't mean it
[01:04:25] yeah 52 days ago
[01:04:28] hope they ban you what do you mean how
[01:04:30] they banned you
[01:04:46] okay
[01:04:48] um I'm gonna be honest chat I just
[01:04:49] really missed you guys I wanted to play
[01:04:50] gunshin so I just started stream but I
[01:04:52] don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing today
[01:04:54] um I'm gonna play Kafka later which is
[01:04:56] out on a day but on engagement like I
[01:04:58] want to get on Abyss clear I wanna Farm
[01:05:00] resin but I don't know where like where
[01:05:02] am I spending my resin also
[01:05:04] now that the news that's out okay
[01:05:13] um
[01:05:15] here's my take okay you pick one of the
[01:05:18] two games that you can Farm gems for and
[01:05:20] then Farm gems and be free to play and
[01:05:22] then on the other you could spend for
[01:05:23] whatever you're missing if you want just
[01:05:25] get it e0 Israel's like I mean it could
[01:05:27] be a lot if you're like unlucky but
[01:05:32] foreign
[01:05:38] you should tell a fake story on no we
[01:05:41] don't have a fake so I already told the
[01:05:43] real story that there was a Redemption
[01:05:45] for however much em you have on a
[01:05:47] character you can redeem that into
[01:05:48] resident once per patch we did that with
[01:05:51] 1050 and now I have 1051. how would I
[01:05:54] lie with such an exact number it's
[01:05:55] literally not even possible so that's
[01:05:57] why we have the resin anyways
[01:05:59] um what we're gonna do today
[01:06:01] is spread resin somewhere now I want to
[01:06:03] make a Vermilion video I want to make
[01:06:04] like a recap main Channel video oh I
[01:06:06] spent 100K resident in Vermillion boom
[01:06:09] that's a video we show a compilation of
[01:06:11] it then we show our show build uh and
[01:06:14] then we go maybe solo uh AP Legends
[01:06:17] maybe Abyss clear we do all that
[01:06:20] now
[01:06:22] the problem is
[01:06:24] that a new stats coming out soon and
[01:06:27] strong box is coming out soon so I kind
[01:06:29] of wanted to make that video before it
[01:06:31] comes out in the strong box
[01:06:37] mid-show build excuse me here bud okay
[01:06:41] not only am I the best to be stupids
[01:06:43] at least before we really came out but
[01:06:45] our shout right now is still top 50.
[01:06:49] he's still like top 50. he's still not
[01:06:52] bad
[01:06:55] kind of
[01:07:01] also I didn't even use the optimizer yet
[01:07:03] if we do it'll probably give us like
[01:07:04] some random artifacts to use because I
[01:07:06] know my best are apparently about the
[01:07:08] best artifact in my account for like the
[01:07:10] best off piece for Xiao that the
[01:07:11] optimizer gave me was this one
[01:07:14] right was it that one yeah like it's
[01:07:16] pretty insane every stat is good so it
[01:07:18] makes sense
[01:07:19] but I can't really use it right now so
[01:07:21] this has this feather is literally on no
[01:07:24] one
[01:07:24] it's on Amber
[01:07:26] this is the difference between my
[01:07:28] deepwood and my [ __ ] Vermillion like
[01:07:31] look at the difference
[01:07:33] do you have any Vermilion pieces that
[01:07:34] have no wasted sub stats let's see uh no
[01:07:37] wasted stats let's see if we can find
[01:07:38] one okay
[01:07:40] no wow that okay
[01:07:42] um okay there's none what about like a
[01:07:44] flower maybe there's a flower with no
[01:07:45] wasted stats
[01:07:49] uh Em's not really great this one's
[01:07:52] actually not bad
[01:07:57] this one's also not bad it's only one
[01:07:59] miss
[01:08:00] okay my flowers are low-key better maybe
[01:08:02] I do offset flower
[01:08:07] wait what if I do offset wait
[01:08:20] yippee
[01:08:22] you
[01:08:24] it's too much crit rate
[01:08:29] anyways this wasn't the point of today's
[01:08:31] stream but I'm distracted now
[01:08:36] why not so much [ __ ] criterate
[01:08:45] unironically a Vortex build [ __ ] it
[01:08:49] yeah actually good for Vortex
[01:08:51] unironically a Vortex build
[01:08:55] yeah this has to be a top tier Vortex
[01:08:57] show unironically unironically a top
[01:09:00] vertex out
[01:09:04] not even copium
[01:09:09] too much attack diminishing returns shut
[01:09:12] the [ __ ] up you're too much attack
[01:09:16] is it just weird as this mic sound
[01:09:18] different it does is it worse okay look
[01:09:21] my U.S I thought I told the story of
[01:09:23] this on the stream my USB port on my go
[01:09:25] XLR is [ __ ] okay the port is [ __ ] so
[01:09:28] I can't use it but I don't want to buy a
[01:09:29] new one so
[01:09:31] I'm waiting for you and pan man I'm
[01:09:35] waiting I'm waiting for them to respond
[01:09:36] to my warranty thing because it's still
[01:09:38] under warranty if not I'm gonna have to
[01:09:39] buy a new one that's like 500 I don't
[01:09:40] want to do that because that's a waste
[01:09:42] so I'm trying to yeah
[01:09:46] it's a little crusty what does that mean
[01:09:49] wait why
[01:09:53] it's fine it'll only be for like a
[01:09:54] stream or two like I can literally I can
[01:09:56] fix it soon
[01:10:00] I ready yeah I just don't want to buy
[01:10:03] another one so I'm trying to like fix it
[01:10:10] bro spends Millions on genshin but can't
[01:10:12] buy a new
[01:10:15] one just because okay first of all first
[01:10:18] of all this is a job second of all I
[01:10:21] don't want to waste the money okay
[01:10:22] especially when I only got this like
[01:10:24] half a year to like maybe a less than a
[01:10:26] year ago I'm not gonna buy a new one
[01:10:29] it's so under warranty it's their fault
[01:10:32] I deserve a new one I'm not gonna whale
[01:10:34] on something that I don't need to whale
[01:10:36] on
[01:10:38] a waste says the guy who pulled Freddie
[01:10:41] higher
[01:10:45] what's wrong
[01:10:48] what's wrong wrong with dare let's look
[01:10:50] at her
[01:10:59] all right on our ugly thought this was
[01:11:01] Vermillion and I teleported to it but it
[01:11:03] was actually gilded
[01:11:13] okay chat
[01:11:15] gilded or Vermillion
[01:11:24] I should do emblem honestly because I
[01:11:26] don't think I'm gonna strongbox emblem
[01:11:42] okay let me do one let Elon decide we
[01:11:45] could roll the dice actually
[01:11:46] not a bad idea
[01:11:48] we'll do one around we'll see
[01:11:55] we'll see we'll see one run one run
[01:11:57] what has
[01:11:59] one if you can give me an example I'll
[01:12:01] stop
[01:12:08] yeah so I am as soon as Fontan comes out
[01:12:10] we're gonna here's what we're gonna do
[01:12:12] oh you guys don't even know about this
[01:12:13] okay
[01:12:14] oh I forgot to do these what the [ __ ]
[01:12:15] okay we can count by this anyways as
[01:12:17] soon as for Vermillion as soon as Fontan
[01:12:19] comes out we're doing two things okay
[01:12:21] day one or day two we are spending 74
[01:12:25] fragile resin or maybe 75 will round up
[01:12:27] a lot I probably have 80 with a battle
[01:12:29] pass I didn't claim yet a lot of fragile
[01:12:31] resin on the new domains I've been
[01:12:33] [ __ ] waiting and we are spending a
[01:12:36] million I expected nothing less from
[01:12:38] this [ __ ] you before we even do that you
[01:12:40] still have 1400 artifacts it's almost
[01:12:42] all five stars we're gonna spend all of
[01:12:45] I'm still scrolling all of this in the
[01:12:47] strong box from Vermillion that is a one
[01:12:49] video then we're spending all of our
[01:12:50] fragile resin on the new set that is
[01:12:52] another video and then whatever we get
[01:12:54] from the new set we're re-putting into
[01:12:55] the strong box surely I do emblem and
[01:12:57] not Vermillion because I'm smart and
[01:12:59] responsible and then that's the third
[01:13:00] video boom
[01:13:10] taking the turn for the better
[01:13:18] have you watched kafka's trailer yes
[01:13:27] I felt things
[01:13:30] wait microbe is not on em I don't think
[01:13:32] I'm not really blooming for yeah like no
[01:13:34] damage
[01:13:42] don't forget about the mainstream okay
[01:13:44] listen
[01:13:45] I'm being honest we will mainstream
[01:13:48] when we do the arc on Quest of Fontana
[01:13:51] it won't be day one but it'll be one of
[01:13:54] the first days
[01:13:56] because they were
[01:13:57] archon Quest Trilogy that is how we do
[01:14:00] it around here but it won't be the first
[01:14:02] day
[01:14:06] okay one more run
[01:14:21] why is there one guy in chat that Keith
[01:14:23] asked me to play League of Legends I am
[01:14:25] not playing League
[01:14:27] stop it
[01:14:31] oh [ __ ] I burst it too late
[01:14:55] okay that this is a cool run that's cool
[01:14:58] okay uh I don't know why I'm in
[01:15:00] Vermilion anymore we'll do one [ __ ] and
[01:15:02] then we'll leave surely surely last run
[01:15:05] surely last run
[01:15:09] how do you get Challenger then I'm just
[01:15:11] not good it's okay though
[01:15:16] Korean those are 40 months appreciate it
[01:15:21] oh I didn't change my artifacts whatever
[01:15:28] minus 14 months in the insane asylum
[01:15:31] awarely I hope everyone do it what do
[01:15:33] you mean oh where
[01:15:37] the words that the grind in your opinion
[01:15:39] Vermillion
[01:15:40] because Echoes is dog [ __ ] and then if
[01:15:43] you're on high ping or you play on the
[01:15:44] Asia server then it's probably bad too
[01:15:45] because your ping is probably higher
[01:15:47] than like a hundred Maybe not maybe you
[01:15:49] like live next to the server room but
[01:16:02] there's a little bits
[01:16:04] which was bad oh yeah which was pretty
[01:16:06] bad
[01:16:09] what was the most annoying domain to
[01:16:11] farm before my [ __ ] uh Vermillion
[01:16:14] days I don't actually know
[01:16:18] I mean I did a lot of verodescent when
[01:16:20] it had like with maidens but that was
[01:16:22] like whatever
[01:16:24] you know because thundering Soother is
[01:16:26] good too Thunder suit is good too
[01:16:29] Crimson witch sucked I agree
[01:16:33] no bless

[01:18:16] of happened

[01:18:51] so before we set all our friends
[01:18:54] want to be responsible
[01:18:55] without genuinely genuinely so if
[01:18:57] there's any character I want to level
[01:18:59] talents [ __ ] I wanna Crown weapons I
[01:19:03] want a weapon artifact anything I wanna
[01:19:06] make sure it's ready so if we can look
[01:19:09] through our characters and see hey does
[01:19:10] anyone need anything that we can do
[01:19:12] before fun turns out now the main one
[01:19:15] that Rings about to me is faruzin
[01:19:18] I do think our farzan should be level
[01:19:21] 90. uh the only problem and I I
[01:19:23] pre-farmed I just don't have the [ __ ]
[01:19:25] henna Berry and you got me [ __ ] up if
[01:19:27] you think I'm farming this so it'll
[01:19:28] happen at some point
[01:19:30] um I do want to Crown some characters
[01:19:32] already crowned
[01:19:36] um I think baiju should be higher than
[01:19:39] seven on his talents
[01:19:43] could crown kazoo uh
[01:19:48] yeah maybe I should do some Talent stuff
[01:19:51] putau could also be crowned
[01:19:56] thank you
[01:19:59] I crowned ushi
[01:20:07] yeah this is the first time I ever have
[01:20:08] 10 millimura I said this last stream I
[01:20:10] have never had 10 millimora ever
[01:20:16] also are Mike will be fixed in a day or
[01:20:17] two it's it's not bad right now but it
[01:20:19] does sound different so disclaimer Mike
[01:20:21] sounds a little bit different
[01:20:23] um
[01:20:23] I can [ __ ] it up like I could turn the
[01:20:25] equalizer off or I can make it sound
[01:20:27] like I'm at McDonald's
[01:20:29] but I think I'll just leave it like this
[01:20:37] um
[01:20:39] okay this guy's Talent should be a bit
[01:20:41] higher but
[01:20:45] I mean I don't know I want a level aloy
[01:20:47] uh to 90. don't ask why Syncro should
[01:20:50] noise 80 is fine yayao could be 90 but
[01:20:53] it's all good uh could have sent Hazel
[01:20:57] if you want
[01:21:01] I just don't want to feel constricted
[01:21:03] you get me like I don't want there to be
[01:21:04] a new character that I feel like I can't
[01:21:06] play because my supports aren't leveled
[01:21:08] so probably Layla I think Layla and
[01:21:10] Candace we should level because I
[01:21:12] actually wanna I think cat is like I
[01:21:13] wanna play her in like bloom
[01:21:15] oh my she's [ __ ]
[01:21:18] she's the same things as far as on
[01:21:22] oh my yeah I can't I'm sorry I'm
[01:21:25] actually sorry uh I mean at least we got
[01:21:27] a level 70.
[01:21:32] hello
[01:21:36] you know what let's go kill no it's not
[01:21:40] hahaha
[01:21:42] okay
[01:21:48] you know what you got royal sphere what
[01:21:50] do you mean it literally matches her
[01:21:52] look it matches her perfectly
[01:21:57] but I do eventually want a 90 every
[01:21:58] character I just I can't really
[01:22:01] I can't
[01:22:03] like I can't justify that because every
[01:22:06] character that's level 90 could be
[01:22:09] Vermillion artifacts that I'm not
[01:22:11] getting does that make sense
[01:22:27] wait Shadow's not ascended what the [ __ ]
[01:22:29] okay we should do this first
[01:22:34] wait there's like no crowd characters

[01:25:14] other one just I thought
[01:25:17] is it only in the abyssity of the killer
[01:25:18] at the same time am I dumb yeah together
[01:25:20] at the same time Not Just Gonna Miss
[01:25:22] Thing

[01:25:51] heat clams so I don't really have spare
[01:25:53] emblem sets now you may be like socks
[01:25:55] What If instead of farming Vermillion
[01:25:57] you had all of these but on emblem true
[01:26:00] uh but but uh uh uh that would be dumb
[01:26:04] because people who Farm emblem every day
[01:26:07] are weird
[01:26:10] that's not true I'm just coping I should
[01:26:12] I should Fire Emblem
[01:26:19] says you dude imagine waking up every
[01:26:21] morning and knowing that you're spending

[01:30:56] you never said that Einstein actually
[01:30:58] discovered his theory of relative
[01:31:00] activity
[01:31:02] uh while he was peeing
[01:31:16] please don't say sus things I don't have
[01:31:18] headphones in

[01:34:32] is like the bane of my existence
[01:34:37] I would rather steal candy from a baby
[01:34:39] than have to change my artifacts every
[01:34:41] stream
[01:34:43] I would rather go up to a rather I'd
[01:34:46] rather go up I would rather climb up a
[01:34:49] tree to save a cat that is stuck up at
[01:34:52] the top of a tree and then leave the cat
[01:34:54] there and climb back down then have to
[01:34:56] change my artifacts every stream
[01:35:04] too far
[01:35:06] sorry I take it back
[01:35:09] is nahida geared

[01:35:46] play like I'm not playing actually no we
[01:35:49] already played the eye today or last
[01:35:50] stream could do like um
[01:35:54] it was cool it was hip who's fresh
[01:35:59] Kafka wear cat ears or bunny ears please
[01:36:01] answer
[01:36:03] uh
[01:36:05] uh bunny
[01:36:13] plays onion
[01:36:16] we could play Xiao with dendro
[01:36:20] and Electro
[01:36:24] because why not because we need to hide
[01:36:26] from them for this so [ __ ] it whatever
[01:36:28] surely we'll still [ __ ]
[01:36:30] yeah it'll be fine
[01:36:34] where's yeah yeah all right we'll play
[01:36:35] bike actually
[01:36:39] this is a [ __ ] terrible team by the
[01:36:40] way
[01:36:44] I'm on a Vortex vanquisher I probably
[01:36:45] wanna I'll bite your Shields technically
[01:36:47] kind of not really
[01:36:50] all right retroversion time
[01:36:53] tell your friends tell your
[01:36:56] teller's Ox is playing retro version
[01:36:57] finally
[01:37:01] not yelling in French angrily
[01:37:06] why would you need that
[01:37:18] Ray ways to the wicked whoa Wicked
[01:37:34] I can't line these guys up it's so
[01:37:36] annoying
[01:37:39] they should be dead okay he's not dead
[01:37:41] the Luke moment can you die
[01:37:45] okay this is a bit too slow a little bit
[01:37:46] so uh We're not gonna do three star
[01:37:48] let's run it back we'll do better I
[01:37:49] think I start with my burst under Luke
[01:37:51] because we kind of [ __ ] it up it's
[01:37:52] just I don't want to apply burning at
[01:37:53] the start so maybe we
[01:37:55] have an idea
[01:38:00] we did this right then we Mark then we
[01:38:03] dilic
[01:38:05] then we nahida
[01:38:08] now we Auto attack another grouped up no
[01:38:10] they're not but they're gonna teleport
[01:38:11] us
[01:38:14] okay that was a terrible order I that
[01:38:16] was the worst order ever brought it back
[01:38:18] I forgot we have Crimson witch we want a
[01:38:19] stock room's a witch okay we start with
[01:38:20] stacking who's witch
[01:38:24] watch this
[01:38:25] I'll just watch it
[01:38:37] thousand oh my God
[01:38:42] oh my God
[01:38:49] you alone time oh I don't like
[01:38:52] that is awkward
[01:38:55] they're dead they're actually all dead
[01:38:57] they're literally all dead they're
[01:38:58] literally l-i-c-h
[01:39:00] -t-r-l-y
[01:39:05] okay a lot better we might die under
[01:39:08] nahida but if she dies then I dies what
[01:39:11] that's that okay
[01:39:13] um
[01:39:15] bullfrog burning for no reason at all
[01:39:20] fun
[01:39:23] heal me thank you
[01:39:28] good damage
[01:39:31] okay Dodge that attack
[01:39:37] I'm just gonna heal everyone
[01:39:52] wait where's the last one oh he's dead
[01:39:57] you want a bowl
[01:40:03] yeah these teams are very scuffed so uh
[01:40:04] don't judge them
[01:40:08] here
[01:40:20] Vortex trial moment
[01:40:25] aggravated shall scratch yes all right
[01:40:28] far as I was not even on predescent by
[01:40:30] the way so official's not even getting
[01:40:32] buffed but it's fine well we're getting
[01:40:34] like aggravate Buffs but
[01:40:39] [ __ ] I don't use farzan [ __ ] uh it's
[01:40:41] fine we killed us here
[01:40:46] Reese summon
[01:40:51] Dodge the
[01:40:53] boom go
[01:40:54] go over here boom go here boom
[01:40:59] you can't really Groove these enemies
[01:41:00] it's kind of sad or maybe you can I'm

[01:41:05] to you
[01:41:10] yes you can shut the [ __ ] up yeah you
[01:41:13] can probably run back but uh I said I'm
[01:41:16] dumb so that absolutely solves me from
[01:41:19] any errors
[01:41:22] are you supposed to run by you probably
[01:41:23] run over there like tug the wall or some
[01:41:25] [ __ ] but
[01:41:26] I don't feel like doing it
[01:41:28] so I'm dumb
[01:41:30] you should Edge bait them yeah it's
[01:41:32] probably that usually for enemies that
[01:41:33] you can't group you just run to the wall
[01:41:34] but it's okay uh skill language let's do
[01:41:38] that
[01:41:43] oh these guys
[01:41:45] I didn't mark them shoot me I deserve it
[01:41:49] okay run it back

[01:41:55] okay I need to funnel better
[01:41:56] I don't know I don't have it I bet you
[01:41:59] can't 36 though what do you mean you'd
[01:42:00] be bad I can't the other can 36 are the
[01:42:02] eyes closed okay I don't have your Lawns
[01:42:04] burst so

[01:42:36] need to wait for your laundry okay
[01:42:40] then we go here
[01:42:45] okay I'm [ __ ] frocking burning but
[01:42:47] it's fine surely burning's a good react
[01:42:49] burning is so bad burning is so bad okay
[01:42:51] we need to make sure we don't proc
[01:42:52] burning but my Yolanda never burst and I
[01:42:54] can't get her burst without using
[01:42:55] abilities so there's actually no way not

[01:43:55] okay now they group up naturally except
[01:43:58] this guy but that's on purpose because
[01:43:59] the the point of this guy is he gets
[01:44:01] bursted so now this guy's dead right so
[01:44:04] now what we do is we go over here right
[01:44:05] we go to the other dude this dude then
[01:44:07] we we burst him down so we break his
[01:44:09] shield
[01:44:10] then we need to heat up everybody
[01:44:13] then watch us
[01:44:15] apply Hydro then we burst again and it's
[01:44:18] just easy as that it's literally easy as
[01:44:19] that I died to burning I died to burning
[01:44:21] the burning reaction killed my deluke I

[02:01:16] wait why did no one tell me it was quiet
[02:01:17] wait let me see
[02:01:20] that is kind of quiet
[02:01:28] oh assistant over here right
[02:01:31] okay or they can just dip
[02:01:35] what are they doing oh this thing
[02:01:39] uh I kind of don't want to talk about
[02:01:41] this rotation at all we're about to proc
[02:01:43] burning yeah I don't want to talk about
[02:01:45] what just happened
[02:01:55] yeah okay we might need okay yeah maybe
[02:01:58] maybe this maybe maybe I cooked uh a
[02:02:00] little too much I might have burnt the
[02:02:01] kitchen
[02:02:06] same three songs I can't okay this is my
[02:02:09] starting playlist okay I'm sorry
[02:02:12] how are we still burning okay well let
[02:02:14] me get some shows first that's why
[02:02:20] wait this one's the higher HP one
[02:02:24] are you [ __ ]
[02:02:41] oh well I mean
[02:02:44] we had like a minute to spare so
[02:02:47] it's all good
[02:02:58] have you ever tried the retry virgin
[02:03:00] team with double Hydro Yellen slash xq
[02:03:03] yes but you don't have a Healer
[02:03:06] so usually what we do
[02:03:08] I also try with all field ayato it
[02:03:10] actually wasn't even bad but usually we
[02:03:13] do for retro version our core is deluke
[02:03:16] nahida and then like usually Elon for
[02:03:19] Hydra resonance but Synchro applies more
[02:03:20] Hydro
[02:03:22] um because she gains HP from Hydro
[02:03:24] resonance and then kokomi because but
[02:03:26] like if you don't need a Healer or you
[02:03:28] can use things for healing then it's
[02:03:29] fine but Virgin uh virgin damages you so
[02:03:32] you can't really go no healer it's it's
[02:03:33] you can't really do that
[02:03:34] the thing with Baidu or yao yao is the
[02:03:37] dendro's very slow which means we
[02:03:39] probably are gonna not have enough
[02:03:40] dendro
[02:04:02] we'll see
[02:04:05] what happens when we do this
[02:04:09] surely we have any dendro anywhere I
[02:04:11] mean we're mostly vaping which isn't
[02:04:13] even bad
[02:04:14] this is actually fine this is like
[02:04:15] low-key better
[02:04:19] but yeah we're like not it's like one
[02:04:21] virgin a year
[02:04:24] nahida prototype Amber
[02:04:26] actually not a bad idea
[02:04:32] flames
[02:04:41] Purge
[02:04:43] one virgin every far is on burst okay
[02:04:46] why are you using farzan's burst as a
[02:04:48] unit of measurement
[02:04:50] why is that how you measure time
[02:04:55] yeah yeah yeah there's like this I mean
[02:04:57] yeah I was better than AOE than baiju
[02:04:59] but she does basically the same thing
[02:05:10] you apart oh let me weave you a verse
[02:05:20] this time is a lot slower but I mean
[02:05:23] we're still cooking somewhat
[02:05:25] still somewhat cooking
[02:05:34] yeah I mean
[02:05:36] yeah
[02:05:39] yeah

[02:05:43] okay let me turn my sound up I mean my
[02:05:45] game sounds up
[02:05:47] it's on two I don't know why we'll turn
[02:05:48] into three or four what is for that how

[02:06:15] how loud is this
[02:06:18] still sounds quiet isn't it
[02:06:21] worthless
[02:06:24] a little bit
[02:06:31] I'm turning it up
[02:06:33] over now

[02:16:49] very good over and under 1500
[02:17:01] do you want to see wait someone over
[02:17:03] under 1500 Vermillion domains completed
[02:17:05] uh I think we've done
[02:17:07] about a thousand one hundred now
[02:17:10] or a thousand something we can check
[02:17:12] we're over a thousand for sure but it's
[02:17:13] a thousand something
[02:17:16] wait actually no wait wait I'm lying I'm
[02:17:18] lying I'm lying I'm lying

[02:17:21] we've no we've done like 2 500 wait I'm
[02:17:24] lying it's a hundred thousand resin
[02:17:26] because we've done we've done we've
[02:17:28] killed like 2600 Rune graders which
[02:17:30] means around 2500 we're in this domain
[02:17:33] minimum so yeah and that's condensed
[02:17:36] resin so for like let's say you don't
[02:17:37] use connects double that that's like 5K
[02:17:39] runs
[02:17:48] Last Christmas I gave you my heart

[02:17:56] in the in the Holly Jolly Spirit or no
[02:18:01] yeah
[02:18:04] no
[02:18:11] okay maybe if we claim before baiju's
[02:18:13] snake comes back to us we'll get a good
[02:18:14] artifact
[02:18:16] fast fast
[02:18:18] maybe we got it I don't know if we got
[02:18:19] it do we got the skip
[02:18:22] I mean that technically technically we
[02:18:25] just need our Nemo technically that
[02:18:26] works we'll go again I was gonna leave
[02:18:28] Vermillion but because that works will
[02:18:29] go again
[02:18:34] who asked shirtless stream when
[02:18:37] uh yeah I'm not gonna answer that
[02:18:41] maybe if we get a Nemo goblet criterate
[02:18:43] crit damage attack ER 4 stats only rolls
[02:18:46] crit
[02:18:47] so never
[02:19:06] mind you have better odds of winning the
[02:19:08] lottery it's not even that hard dude
[02:19:11] it's literally not even hard to get a
[02:19:13] good an email golly look look literally
[02:19:14] I'll show you right now I'll show you
[02:19:16] it's not even hard I just haven't been
[02:19:18] trying look you wanna
[02:19:19] you want me to try watch here's how
[02:19:21] here's the play first
[02:19:23] wait for kokomi's jellyfish cooldown
[02:19:37] use Comey jellyfish
[02:19:39] kirora cat box meow exactly three times
[02:19:45] why Drew snake claim before the snake
[02:19:47] snake arms you have to skip right before
[02:19:49] the snake gets you we got it and now
[02:19:50] watch us
[02:19:52] foreign
[02:19:57] just unfortunate it was on the wrong
[02:20:03] okay that was actually good though we
[02:20:04] actually got good pieces
[02:20:08] just four stars
[02:20:11] yeah one more one more
[02:20:13] one more
[02:20:14] we'll get it but five star this time
[02:20:15] we'll get about five star maybe it's
[02:20:16] because I didn't claim my battle pass
[02:20:19] there you go
[02:20:26] okay so watch this we're just doing
[02:20:27] normal clear
[02:20:29] there's no manipulation of luck you're
[02:20:31] trapped here forever
[02:20:32] I'm not stuck here forever you're stuck
[02:20:34] here forever you're invested you want to
[02:20:36] be there when I get my perfect
[02:20:38] Vermillion goblet because you know
[02:20:39] what's gonna happen one more next stream
[02:20:41] is gonna happen you think a thousand
[02:20:43] streams in a row because surely no one
[02:20:46] man can be so unlucky so many times in a
[02:20:49] row we're in this together
[02:20:51] watch watch us watch
[02:20:54] this
[02:20:55] Kirara alt in the tree
[02:20:57] baiju snake
[02:21:16] hey streamer Thai for the content good
[02:21:19] luck snake that foreign
[02:21:45] to the person who's asking hey how many
[02:21:47] Vermillion rounds have you done
[02:22:02] yeah about 2500
[02:22:05] we've killed 25-92
[02:22:13] 2500 is around 100 000 resin for the
[02:22:15] record
[02:22:25] someone said that's low Keck l
[02:22:28] the amount of Rune Raiders I have killed
[02:22:30] in the Vermilion domain
[02:22:32] would be around like 300
[02:22:35] 300 to like 380 or something million
[02:22:38] Mora it would be over 300 million more
[02:22:40] if instead of all of this we did more La
[02:22:44] lines
[02:22:48] I can be the first person to hit a
[02:22:49] billion
[02:22:57] but you're not using an offset goblet
[02:22:59] oh my my poor innocent friend Seoul
[02:23:02] civilian I am using all of my pieces
[02:23:04] should be offset
[02:23:06] I mean I so I usually use this goblet
[02:23:08] but I don't have a great feather or
[02:23:10] flower
[02:23:11] I usually use this goblet but it's like
[02:23:13] it this helmet is only good when it's on
[02:23:15] set it's good but it's mainly good onset
[02:23:18] not offset
[02:23:33] sedge
[02:23:37] less than three our feathers are better
[02:23:39] than our our feathers aren't bad though
[02:23:41] I think our best feather is
[02:23:44] foreign
[02:23:45] like for the optimizer they want us to
[02:23:47] use or not the alternator for Akasha
[02:23:48] they want us to use this one
[02:23:50] because then we have exactly enough ER
[02:23:52] to hit the 130 amount and then it looks
[02:23:53] good but
[02:23:54] yeah
[02:23:55] your alerts are dead wait really
[02:24:01] this is 20 months
[02:24:12] you should look up the sunken cost I
[02:24:14] know what the sunken cost fallacy is but
[02:24:16] I'll look it up I'll look it up just
[02:24:18] just to entertain you
[02:24:32] I'll entertain the idea
[02:24:35] much of our decision making is focused
[02:24:37] on how and where
[02:24:43] decisions are easily skewed the sunk
[02:24:47] cost fallacy is one of the more frequent
[02:24:49] delusions which clouds our judgment
[02:24:53] some costs are outlays of time money or
[02:24:57] effort that we've already made and
[02:24:58] because they've already been made we
[02:25:00] can't do or resin they're a thing of the
[02:25:02] past they're sunk the issue with sunk
[02:25:04] costs is that we pay too much attention
[02:25:06] to them we tend to base our current
[02:25:09] decisions on what we've already invested
[02:25:11] leading us to feel like we have too much
[02:25:14] investment yo I never say this though I
[02:25:17] have never said I feel like I've
[02:25:19] invested too much I've never said that I
[02:25:23] have never said this
[02:25:26] okay I have but there's a dude there's a
[02:25:28] difference between an investment and an
[02:25:30] addiction like if you go up to one of
[02:25:32] the top investors of our time are you
[02:25:34] gonna be like not man don't invest in in
[02:25:37] in in apple 26 years ago no you're dumb
[02:25:40] Sun cost fallacy quit
[02:25:43] if you've ever found yourself staying
[02:25:46] for the entirety of a movie in the
[02:25:48] theater even though you think it's
[02:25:49] terrible then you know exactly what
[02:25:51] we're talking about
[02:25:53] yeah what does that have to do with
[02:25:54] Vermilion right if we buy a movie ticket
[02:25:56] for ten dollars many of us feel like we
[02:25:58] have to stay for the entire movie even
[02:26:00] if it's absolutely terrible and our
[02:26:03] mindset but it's an experience then you
[02:26:06] can talk about that bad movie and laugh
[02:26:08] about it and then you like Bond over it
[02:26:10] is gone the minute we bought the ticket
[02:26:12] whether we stay for the whole movie or
[02:26:15] leave 15 minutes in we're still out 10
[02:26:17] bucks
[02:26:18] an example that's often used to
[02:26:20] illustrate the sunk cost fallacy is
[02:26:24] listen to this French and British
[02:26:26] government super okay the two government
[02:26:28] s wanted to make these really fast
[02:26:30] supersonic airplanes that could fly
[02:26:32] across the Atlantic and okay two
[02:26:34] airplanes but this project was really
[02:26:36] expensive and in the middle of it they
[02:26:39] realized that it wasn't going to pay off
[02:26:40] they weren't going to make much money
[02:26:42] from it but okay I continued to sink
[02:26:44] money into the project anyway on the
[02:26:47] grounds that they had already invested a
[02:26:48] lot of money the government's paid too
[02:26:51] much attention to sunk costs when
[02:26:53] deciding whether or not to continue with
[02:26:54] the project so let's say for example
[02:26:57] there's like an artifact set that you're
[02:27:00] really farming right and then they
[02:27:01] announced a new one that's like more
[02:27:02] efficient
[02:27:03] and then you keep farming the all the
[02:27:06] old one they were never going to get
[02:27:08] there but that's not what I'm doing
[02:27:09] because vermillion's still the best so I
[02:27:10] should have done ignore those sunk costs
[02:27:15] let me speed it up I have to involve
[02:27:17] money they're just as real with
[02:27:18] non-monetary things too we can fall into
[02:27:20] this trap when we continue to wear a
[02:27:22] pair of shoes that make our feet hurt
[02:27:23] solely because we spent a hundred
[02:27:24] dollars on them but we also fall into
[02:27:26] this trap when we stay in a relationship
[02:27:27] slowly because we've already spent three
[02:27:28] years of our life with that person the
[02:27:30] sunk cost fallacy seeps into nearly
[02:27:32] every aspect of our life and because of
[02:27:33] this it's worth asking the question why
[02:27:35] does this happen I think there are two
[02:27:37] main reasons yeah no this isn't me we
[02:27:38] don't want to appear to be wasted
[02:27:39] anytime we stop investing our resources
[02:27:41] we feel like we're admitting that
[02:27:42] everything we've already invested has
[02:27:44] been wasted some of us might feel like
[02:27:45] our job is terrible but I didn't that's
[02:27:47] obviously to quit would make it seem
[02:27:50] like we've wasted a large portion of our
[02:27:51] life and we don't like that it doesn't
[02:27:53] sound like me we don't like losses if
[02:27:55] we've already paid for something we feel
[02:27:57] like we have to do it even if a better
[02:27:58] opportunity comes up
[02:28:02] a friend calls us and offers a free
[02:28:04] ticket to a Broadway play we can only go
[02:28:06] to one of them when making the decision
[02:28:07] on which event to attend I think we'd
[02:28:09] have a harder time missing the concert
[02:28:10] we paid 100 for then we realize even
[02:28:12] though we might prefer the Broadway play
[02:28:13] this is because as Richard thaler
[02:28:15] explains it paying a hundred dollars for
[02:28:16] a ticket to a concert that you did not
[02:28:18] attend feels a lot like losing a hundred
[02:28:19] dollars this idea that we don't like
[02:28:21] losses okay but I'm not a loser I'm not
[02:28:24] a loser if I don't get good artifacts
[02:28:28] I'm not a loser if I okay how do I
[02:28:31] explain this just because we spent resin
[02:28:34] somewhere and it could have been spent
[02:28:36] somewhere else doesn't make us a loser
[02:28:39] you're as wasteful is why we weigh some
[02:28:40] costs so heavily we're a loser because
[02:28:42] we play gentian
[02:28:52] crew and psychologists alike have made
[02:28:54] this very clear in their research
[02:28:57] we can't get sunk costs back oh does it
[02:28:59] say
[02:29:01] no matter how compelling it may seem to
[02:29:03] repeat some costs are irrelevant to
[02:29:05] current decisions
[02:29:08] we can't get some costs back all we can
[02:29:10] do is look at the resources we currently
[02:29:11] have and investment-wise okay but does
[02:29:14] this guy know about gambling
[02:29:16] no no let me explain let me don't gamble
[02:29:19] but I'm just saying
[02:29:20] does this how has this guy seen this
[02:29:22] meme
[02:29:34] has he seen this
[02:29:35] okay this is the worst quality I've ever
[02:29:37] seen okay but no think about it think
[02:29:39] about it
[02:29:41] if we spent okay
[02:29:43] let's look at statistics for a second
[02:29:45] statistics right math you don't argue
[02:29:47] math right okay let's say someone on
[02:29:50] average you spend
[02:29:52] a million resin a million
[02:29:55] in a domain
[02:29:56] Amelia on average you're gonna have
[02:29:59] you're gonna be very close to the
[02:30:01] average amount of expected roles because
[02:30:03] it's a big sample size so you're gonna
[02:30:05] have a lot of good artifacts a lot of
[02:30:07] bad artifacts a lot of whatever
[02:30:08] artifacts you've done a million you're
[02:30:10] gonna get a lot thing
[02:30:16] first thousand resin
[02:30:18] ten thousand resin
[02:30:19] 100 000 resin
[02:30:23] I've already filled the low sample like
[02:30:25] the the on the spectrum of artifacts I
[02:30:28] filled the like bad part so now I know
[02:30:31] the good part is coming even if it's
[02:30:33] still a 50 50 every time even if the
[02:30:35] odds don't change I know that the bigger
[02:30:38] the sample size the more things even out
[02:30:40] so we have to add to the sample true
[02:30:42] true that's not how statistics work but
[02:30:45] it's how regention works we should feel
[02:30:48] better about putting a book 100 pages in
[02:30:50] if we're not enjoying
[02:30:52] true
[02:30:53] can I link this video how do I link a
[02:30:56] video share
[02:30:57] is you guys want to watch it
[02:30:59] but uh I'm right for the record
[02:31:01] let it be known
[02:31:14] look up gamblers fallacy
[02:31:18] we are not that isn't dude shut up it's
[02:31:21] only the same thing
[02:31:23] we just did
[02:31:33] let me turn down a little
[02:31:40] bro learned nothing
[02:31:42] side effect
[02:31:46] s
[02:31:49] okay but it's it's different it's
[02:31:52] different if you're like spending money
[02:31:54] like okay
[02:31:55] if you're spending money
[02:31:59] I guess resin is kind of like money but
[02:32:01] it doesn't it no copium right no copium
[02:32:04] no copium should do a therapy session
[02:32:06] with healthy game
[02:32:08] dude no copium right I would rather be a
[02:32:12] resin addict than a gotcha addict
[02:32:15] true I would rather fi get my fix off of
[02:32:19] farming Vermilion than off of pulling
[02:32:22] for every character well I guess I
[02:32:23] already do but then c6ing every
[02:32:25] character
[02:32:26] you're both no I just I need every new
[02:32:29] character I haven't pulled in so long I
[02:32:32] don't even have the battle pass Mission
[02:32:33] look I don't even have make 50 wishes I
[02:32:37] can't even do it
[02:32:53] be addicted to emblem idiot okay but I'm
[02:32:56] not addicted to things that are like
[02:32:57] smart

[02:37:01] I love playing Bloom against a single
[02:37:03] Target
[02:37:08] cool
[02:37:20] oh [ __ ] we have to explore the new
[02:37:22] island okay and we'll die later we have
[02:37:23] to cover resin I forgot forgot [ __ ]
[02:37:25] kokomi Island just came out we have to
[02:37:26] do that damn
[02:37:30] uh okay let's do emblem
[02:37:36] we'll see we'll see
[02:37:41] what happens if I searched Vermillion
[02:37:45] indoors to avoid these conditions if
[02:37:47] possible okay let's Slipknot song what
[02:37:49] else
[02:37:53] oh no
[02:37:55] I said video called 1554.
[02:38:14] wait I'm out of disk space
[02:38:17] what the [ __ ]
[02:38:26] let me just delete something
[02:38:33] wait what do I say I search for a
[02:38:34] million right I see my own video I
[02:38:36] wonder what I said hey what's up guys
[02:38:37] today welcome to the new artifacts that
[02:38:39] are coming in past 2.6 that were
[02:38:40] announced during the last one for a
[02:38:41] million I'm sure you know loses HP
[02:38:42] passively throughout his burst on top of
[02:38:43] all four dude I was saying back here
[02:38:45] dude I was dude
[02:38:49] March 24th that was the character that
[02:38:52] I'm sure you know loses HP passively
[02:38:53] throughout his burst on top of also
[02:38:54] giving him a ton of energy percent from
[02:38:56] its effect in fact because you're
[02:38:57] getting so much damage percent on child
[02:38:58] you get the last four piece is something
[02:39:00] that is quite nice and so this new four
[02:39:01] piece artifact set is undoubtedly xiao's
[02:39:02] best solid because it just gives you
[02:39:03] more attack instead of gaining 36 that
[02:39:05] it highly depends on your sub stats the
[02:39:06] advantages of having a turanescence too
[02:39:08] glad is that they're usually sets that
[02:39:09] you can basically Farm passively okay
[02:39:10] yeah they're strong boxes or farming
[02:39:12] bosses and you can get the two piece
[02:39:13] from in essence dude how are all these
[02:39:14] pieces better than my Vermillion by the
[02:39:16] way literally every piece I click on in
[02:39:18] this video look this one's better this
[02:39:20] one's better very very good on top of
[02:39:21] just sub stats and actually I want to
[02:39:22] emphasize that this is a big thing since
[02:39:23] a lot of xiaomi's have already geared
[02:39:24] their Xiao and me for example while I
[02:39:26] will farm this new set to get a new like
[02:39:27] perfectly finding better artifacts than
[02:39:29] the ones that are already on my channel
[02:39:30] are very very slim however on top it
[02:39:32] does that though the increase in attack
[02:39:33] percent is more or less relevant
[02:39:34] depending on the team you're running and
[02:39:35] what bucks you're getting your child for
[02:39:36] example if you pair this character with
[02:39:37] a bend it who gives you 100 as well as
[02:39:39] the universe Sublime set and maybe a
[02:39:40] thrilling Tails user then going from 36
[02:39:41] attack to 66 is no longer as big of an
[02:39:44] increase although it is still quite
[02:39:45] relevant I will say in defense of the
[02:39:46] set that free Hyper carry like Xiao who
[02:39:47] likes attack and who is the main source
[02:39:49] of what I mean by this but it is
[02:39:52] what is this
[02:39:56] increase although if you want to say
[02:39:58] that while this first artifact set is
[02:40:00] pretty Niche and I only recommend it for
[02:40:01] Xiao unless you want to just take damage
[02:40:02] on another character to gain attack
[02:40:03] percent and if that ever becomes the
[02:40:04] metal add up in common the second
[02:40:05] artifact that Echoes of an offering is
[02:40:07] definitely more flexible before I get
[02:40:08] into even the four piece I do want to
[02:40:09] say that the two piece of this set is
[02:40:10] artifacts or characters that you don't
[02:40:11] already have built well I said that
[02:40:12] they're viable Alternatives many times
[02:40:13] already if you already have a good like
[02:40:14] pale flame set on a physical carry or
[02:40:16] yeah I don't want to listen to this
[02:40:17] anymore it's making me sad
[02:40:19] thank you
[02:40:20] all zioxx I don't know it was like a
[02:40:24] year ago
[02:40:30] what if we play characters we've never
[02:40:31] played oh we're in emblem now it doesn't
[02:40:33] matter okay I'll just play Scar
[02:40:37] did you say better for sure I've been
[02:40:38] hearing mixed things it's literally
[02:40:40] it's virtually the same just goes on
[02:40:43] whichever is easier for you to farm
[02:40:44] that's that's what you need to know I'll
[02:40:45] make a I have a video made on it it's
[02:40:47] just not out yet it'll be out today
[02:40:48] probably
[02:41:01] wow can you imagine the can you imagine
[02:41:03] if they release another set that's as
[02:41:05] good as Vermillion for Xiao that would
[02:41:06] be crazy that would actually be insane
[02:41:09] that'd be insane if right before like if
[02:41:11] before I get a good Vermillion set they
[02:41:13] release another set that would be
[02:41:15] [ __ ] insane there's no way they
[02:41:16] [ __ ] do that there's no way that
[02:41:18] happens
[02:41:29] they wouldn't do that they wouldn't do
[02:41:31] that
[02:41:32] foreign
[02:41:41] I got an offer to work in Europe but if
[02:41:44] I move my account will have high ping
[02:41:46] what should I do okay
[02:41:49] now
[02:41:50] listen
[02:41:52] if you're basing your life decisions
[02:41:55] around your ping and gentian impact then
[02:41:58] something along the way went very wrong
[02:42:02] with that said it depends do you farm
[02:42:04] echoes did you farm Echoes and Vermilion
[02:42:06] on
[02:42:07] like it's not worth it if not you can do
[02:42:09] whatever you want it's not that big of a
[02:42:10] deal you'll have to just like like
[02:42:12] dodging on hyping it's like most of it's
[02:42:13] the same you just have to like get used
[02:42:14] to timing
[02:42:23] are you gonna run the French set okay
[02:42:25] why are you calling it The French set
[02:42:27] well you can't pronounce
[02:42:30] uh sounds like a skill issue I can't lie
[02:42:44] following me
[02:42:48] don't get too close
[02:42:55] that being French isn't a skill
[02:42:58] that's [ __ ] up
[02:43:06] true there is no cure
[02:43:11] there is still no cure
[02:43:26] oh I mean this double Laurel I I still
[02:43:29] really good it's still really good it's
[02:43:30] still really good I'm happy I'm happy

[02:55:21] artifacts got mixed up okay this is why
[02:55:23] we need artifact presets to save our
[02:55:26] future Generations
[02:55:28] yes we are playing crystallize that is
[02:55:30] why
[02:55:31] we're playing shatter shatter
[02:55:33] crystallize
[02:55:35] okay let's do another run surely get
[02:55:36] something good
[02:55:43] don't worry guys when when do we get
[02:55:44] dude with fontendering a new Hydro
[02:55:47] reactions hydro and Geo wet Rock we'll
[02:55:50] we'll do like what's gonna happen Okay
[02:55:52] wet Rock right you apply hydro and Geo
[02:55:54] together what happens is the enemy he'll
[02:55:56] get he'll get
[02:55:59] let me think okay
[02:56:02] what happens is
[02:56:04] the enemy you apply wet onto them right
[02:56:07] they're wet then the rock hits them it
[02:56:09] it it it it'll it'll
[02:56:14] cement cement is better okay you
[02:56:19] you cement
[02:56:20] maybe cement maybe you get wet Rock but
[02:56:23] then if you use a Nemo on it it's kind
[02:56:25] of like Quicken right there's the wet
[02:56:26] Rock Aura on enemies and then if you use
[02:56:29] a Nemo on it it procs cement because it
[02:56:32] swirls the [ __ ] rock and the water it
[02:56:36] makes cement the enemies all get
[02:56:38] petrified like John Lee's burst and then
[02:56:40] also take two times more damage while
[02:56:43] they're petrified so with a play as you
[02:56:45] you cement then you swapped your DPS and
[02:56:47] then you Lament
[02:56:53] dude that was actually smart you play
[02:56:54] Xiao farzan Zhang Li [ __ ] Barbara
[02:56:58] boom cement

[02:57:57] what is this symbol
[02:58:03] oh it is a song
[02:58:11] which is kind of pretty
[02:58:14] for people who are questioning about the
[02:58:16] little
[02:58:17] stand Quantum symbol in the game thus
[02:58:20] Celie is the first Quantum unit in
[02:58:21] honkai and back third so Quantum squared
[02:58:24] stands for Sealy X Sealy which is you
[02:58:26] and I and this song is a theme song for
[02:58:28] the upcoming cutscene on chapter 39.

[03:10:59] I don't want to waste I don't know I
[03:11:00] actually know I'm trying not to waste
[03:11:02] money I don't want to but I feel like

[03:12:41] worry about her at least it's fine
[03:12:46] at least it's fun all right
[03:12:49] they wouldn't kill off a character that
[03:12:50] looks like that no game no game company
[03:12:52] would do that a character that looks
[03:12:54] that good they would never don't worry
[03:12:56] the the the the the support who won the
[03:13:00] worlds in League this year he uh made he
[03:13:03] wanted his uh skin to be Alicia like
[03:13:05] they designed it off her so they
[03:13:07] wouldn't kill a character that like
[03:13:08] important
[03:13:18] is there a good shots even though he's
[03:13:20] as far as long yeah you don't need
[03:13:21] farzan but if she sees zero you can use
[03:13:23] her in Triple A Nemo if not you don't
[03:13:24] need to use her
[03:13:37] foreign
[03:13:55] remember help comes first
[03:14:11] oh that's fine it's fine it's fine it's
[03:14:14] fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's
[03:14:16] fine it's fine I'm tired I'm tired I'm
[03:14:18] actually tired I'm actually tired it's
[03:14:19] because I'm tired dude it's not my fault
[03:14:21] I'm tired how is that my fault how is
[03:14:24] that my fault
[03:14:27] like maybe the sacrifice will get us a
[03:14:29] good a good artifact we'll get emblem
[03:14:31] circlit crit rate
[03:14:35] well we did get abnormal circular rate
[03:14:37] it was just a four star
[03:14:47] wait
[03:14:52] [ __ ] I should go back to Vermillion it's

[03:15:17] before we roll it let me try it again
[03:15:29] if this was emblem though if this was
[03:15:31] Vermillion that would have been an
[03:15:32] echo's piece because emblem is
[03:15:34] Vermillion and reminiscence is Echoes
[03:15:35] does that make sense that makes sense so
[03:15:37] it wouldn't have been good anyways I
[03:15:38] mean it would have been a good it would
[03:15:39] have been Echo so yeah it's not like we
[03:15:41] missed a Vermillion Beast it's fine

[03:51:23] heart of depth and um
[03:51:28] 32k HP is a yato on HP sounds better
[03:51:32] than ACC Sans or is it the same
[03:51:35] wait wait whoa did you mean Elon or are
[03:51:39] you
[03:51:44] your ayato is on 32k HP is HP sounds
[03:51:49] better or is it the same bro it's not
[03:51:51] the same or better
[03:51:53] what are you talking HP is not an
[03:51:56] ayatometric you have more HP on your
[03:51:59] ayato than I do on my alarm
[03:52:01] and she's on an HP circlet
[03:52:10] I don't does not look I know he has a
[03:52:13] passive somewhere that's like where like
[03:52:16] some [ __ ] has HP I forget where it is
[03:52:18] yeah you get Nami sin damage bonus one
[03:52:21] percent max HP per stock when it's
[03:52:23] crowned wow
[03:52:25] yeah
[03:52:27] it is not it is not nearly as good as
[03:52:30] attack
[03:52:34] so uh I don't know if that's a joke or
[03:52:36] if you're just like unsure if you're
[03:52:38] unsure definitely go attack
[03:52:40] regardless of your set
[03:52:45] wait what if we go Jade Cutter Plus 20
[03:52:48] hp oh Jade cutter HP
[03:52:51] HP true
[03:52:52] true
[03:52:53] to have 21k
[03:52:56] well that's too much great
[03:53:00] I need Miss splitter man
[03:53:09] yo Zion why did he censor ziox why did
[03:53:12] you do Zed why asterisk X
[03:53:16] first time here from YouTube glad you
[03:53:18] are as chaotic as those clips I'm not
[03:53:20] chaotic what are you talking about
[03:53:22] sorry Eclipse take me out of context
[03:53:32] well let me change my pet
[03:53:34] so dude that's floating next to me I
[03:53:36] want what I want
[03:53:39] wait what the [ __ ] is this
[03:53:42] okay well
[03:53:49] the Damned will sooner die again
[03:53:53] xenophobic lap
[03:53:55] no no no no no or use the silly I think
[03:53:59] that lamp is Is Us
[03:54:02] I like the pink Sealy pretty cute
[03:54:06] no but it makes noises right no I
[03:54:07] actually wanted to make noises maybe
[03:54:09] this one's the best
[03:54:21] foreign
[03:54:35] moment
[03:54:40] hold Z
[03:54:42] oh I forgot about that
[03:54:54] because I have ayato on J Cutter Plus HP
[03:54:58] Sun plus HP sub stats with Crete my
[03:55:01] ratio is 65 Crete rate 238 Crete damage
[03:55:06] I tested the attack Sands it's almost
[03:55:08] the same or it has a 600 damage
[03:55:11] difference
[03:55:14] um
[03:55:16] yeah you still want an attack sense
[03:55:20] and uh the investment's very high at
[03:55:23] that point you might want some crit rate
[03:55:25] also
[03:55:29] let's say it is only like uh like let's
[03:55:31] say it's uh how much eight 600 let's say
[03:55:33] it's 600 damage difference right I
[03:55:35] thought those killings aren't very high
[03:55:36] so if you're doing and you attack a lot
[03:55:38] so if each normal attack is 600 less
[03:55:40] you're doing like 10 normal attacks
[03:55:42] that's 6K
[03:55:45] which is basically an extra normal
[03:55:46] attack
[03:55:58] I'm not doing a best one but I don't
[03:56:02] I missed a chat I'm streaming a while uh
[03:56:04] okay so I have to stream Kafka
[03:56:07] at like she's out at 1pm my time it's
[03:56:10] currently 4 15 which means I have to
[03:56:13] start and I have to pre-farm some
[03:56:14] characters so I probably have to start a
[03:56:16] bit earlier uh because we're gonna be
[03:56:18] grinding so I'm gonna do next three
[03:56:20] movie star Rail and then stream after
[03:56:21] will be gentian star rail is gonna be
[03:56:23] later today it's not even tomorrow it's
[03:56:25] literally later today
[03:56:27] so two streams today and then gentian
[03:56:29] again after well another day so I think
[03:56:32] what's gonna happen with star rail is
[03:56:33] it's gonna I'm gonna stream it
[03:56:36] uh I'm autoballing it right now but I'm
[03:56:38] gonna assume it
[03:56:39] and a release for Kafka
[03:56:44] and in the meantime I'm gonna
[03:56:47] record some Kafka stuff on an Asia
[03:56:49] account just to get footage in case I do
[03:56:51] want to make a Kafka guide which I think
[03:56:53] I will
[03:56:53] uh because I already started it and
[03:56:55] she's pretty easy to build
[03:56:57] well not easy but I think she's worth a
[03:56:59] guide
[03:57:01] um
[03:57:03] and then after that we will do another
[03:57:05] interesting so I think that's the plan
[03:57:08] the only thing is I do need to stream
[03:57:09] early
[03:57:13] I need to start before
[03:57:18] kafka's out because I would need to
[03:57:19] pre-farm
[03:57:23] um
[03:57:25] yeah we need to pre-farm
[03:57:30] the only thing I don't like is that
[03:57:33] I didn't like play Kafka at all or do
[03:57:36] anything with Kafka
[03:57:38] um I know how to Builder and stuff
[03:57:40] but I don't know if it's worth making a
[03:57:43] guide because it's probably already some
[03:57:44] I don't know but I assume
[03:57:47] but I think I'm still gonna do it
[03:57:50] because there's a lot of weird [ __ ] with
[03:57:52] our teams that I needed to test but
[03:57:56] we'll do that when she's out
[03:58:04] because there's like weird [ __ ] with
[03:58:05] like yeah
[03:58:09] performing the day off I can't no I have
[03:58:11] her I have Kafka pre-farmed but it's
[03:58:13] probably like I didn't look at relics
[03:58:14] yet I don't know what I'm gonna like I
[03:58:16] know what to put on her like attack and
[03:58:17] speed and [ __ ] but I didn't look at what
[03:58:19] I have for her so yeah
[03:58:23] also I'd have to level my either Luca or
[03:58:26] sampo
[03:58:27] Luca Tim
[03:58:32] oh also I have to upload my [ __ ] the
[03:58:34] video of the new sets the new artifact
[03:58:36] sets well I gotta do that gosh probably
[03:58:39] [ __ ] end so I can do that like the
[03:58:41] genjen like this I just have to trim the
[03:58:42] shout part it's too long I'm talking
[03:58:44] about shower for way too long so for
[03:58:45] most people please just go with
[03:58:46] whichever one is more convenient for you
[03:58:48] to farm
[03:58:50] is going to be in a new domain with
[03:58:53] golden troops so if you're ready okay
[03:58:55] true
[03:59:00] NPC socks
[03:59:08] this one slaps
[03:59:10] but yeah I think if they don't hit my
[03:59:13] customer support line up back for my
[03:59:15] audio software I'll just buy another one
[03:59:16] and then try to return the first I don't
[03:59:18] know I'll see what happens but I don't
[03:59:20] want to have scuffed audio for too long
[03:59:21] so we'll see
[03:59:33] I just don't want to waste money so
[03:59:35] hopefully I don't have to because it's
[03:59:37] literally just a USB port that's what
[03:59:38] that's what [ __ ] me it the whole thing
[03:59:40] works it literally still works I just
[03:59:42] can't connect it to my computer because
[03:59:44] I the USB port doesn't work so
[03:59:48] that's why they can just fix it but I
[03:59:50] don't know uh I I don't have an aux
[03:59:53] cable so I'm ordering I ordered an
[03:59:54] oxtail it's like five bucks that's
[03:59:55] shipping tomorrow morning so I'll try
[03:59:58] that see if that works but I don't know
[04:00:02] ha
[04:00:05] ha
[04:00:15] oh yeah I also have to do memory chaos
[04:00:17] before copter comes out because I don't
[04:00:19] have to do like the dog [ __ ] floors with
[04:00:21] her I want to get like pretty late into
[04:00:22] it
[04:00:23] because we can probably full clear it
[04:00:24] unless Kafka is bad but yeah
[04:00:39] ah
[04:00:47] boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[04:00:58] also uh I I figured two things out chat
[04:01:01] one actually there's a lot of things
[04:01:02] first of all with regarding our free to
[04:01:04] play account I'm gonna be grinding that
[04:01:06] but since there's a lot of videos I have
[04:01:07] to rush out now it's I can't do it I
[04:01:09] can't play it today but the way we'll do
[04:01:11] it and the way I'm gonna make it to
[04:01:12] video is we'll start the like actual
[04:01:13] start date once I can play consistently
[04:01:15] uh but for now we're just gonna be
[04:01:17] playing in the background
[04:01:18] um and soon it'll be like bonus content
[04:01:21] second
[04:01:23] uh I'm opening up first account forms
[04:01:26] because we want to fix a Chris account
[04:01:27] I'm going to make that into video in my
[04:01:29] Discord soon so stay tuned for that as
[04:01:30] well as a whale one we'll do one curse
[04:01:32] for like any account and then one whale
[04:01:34] account review and those will probably
[04:01:36] be around Fontan whale encounter will be
[04:01:37] after Fontana and curse you could do
[04:01:38] before
[04:01:40] um and
[04:01:43] what no that's it just expect more
[04:01:45] streams that's all
[04:01:47] right freak you guys
[04:01:49] thought that is literally in a week I
[04:01:50] can't wait
[04:01:52] [ __ ] you and then when fathers out
[04:01:54] that's like turbo content so I have to
[04:01:57] go upload a video and record some things
[04:01:59] and also sleep because in like
[04:02:03] probably
[04:02:05] 10 hours
[04:02:07] okay if I'm awake in seven hours I'll be
[04:02:11] live but there's no way I'm awake so
[04:02:12] probably like 10 hours
[04:02:15] eight hours nine hours something like
[04:02:17] that I will be live
[04:02:22] with
[04:02:24] star Rail and then getting again
[04:02:26] later uh tomorrow in two days probably I
[04:02:29] think that's a plan so thanks for being
[04:02:31] here I love you guys
[04:02:33] means the world that you're still
[04:02:34] watching me despite me being a loser
[04:02:37] uh sort of the lack of streams but we're
[04:02:39] back and
[04:02:42] with that said
[04:02:44] streaming 10 hours three you frogs
[04:02:46] please
[04:02:48] never
[04:02:49] yeah we probably will reduce to just
[04:02:51] standing around then
[04:02:54] I don't want to miss any release so I'll
[04:02:56] be awake around around that I'll just I
[04:02:59] want to start a bit early but worst case
[04:03:00] it is Auto Battle off stream or
[04:03:02] something
[04:03:03] while I edit
[04:03:10] all right we're
[04:03:13] up big fan
[04:03:14] we're gonna raid
[04:03:16] a catboy playing Star rail I think we've
[04:03:19] definitely rated him before I remember
[04:03:21] his stream was pretty cool so
[04:03:23] yeah
[04:03:25] I don't know him but I like his model
[04:03:26] and his car that seems pretty box so
[04:03:28] we're gonna rate him
