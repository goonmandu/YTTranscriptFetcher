[00:08:20] hello zaj but um
[00:08:23] I don't know it just wasn't so
[00:08:25] unfortunate
[00:08:26] um
[00:08:28] yeah so today we have to do the abyss
[00:08:30] because it just changed and every time
[00:08:31] there's a new Abyss I do a new Abyss
[00:08:32] that is the plan
[00:08:34] um
[00:08:36] I will say okay my residence dude it
[00:08:38] took me so long to start streaming my
[00:08:39] resin okay okay so I thought I was gonna
[00:08:42] early stream yesterday right so I spent
[00:08:44] all my resin then when I woke up so I
[00:08:47] planned it to wear when I wake up I'll
[00:08:48] have like 120. so I woke up I had like
[00:08:50] 120. then it took me so long to stream
[00:08:52] that was 160. so I spent 20 and now it's
[00:08:55] back capped again
[00:08:59] here's what it is
[00:09:01] um
[00:09:02] is what it is
[00:09:06] uh
[00:09:08] the plan I posted it in Discord so those
[00:09:11] of you who are illiterate are asking why
[00:09:13] I'm doing this today and not our
[00:09:14] Conquest but to the normal people you
[00:09:16] already know that what we're doing is
[00:09:18] the following a bit stream today because
[00:09:20] it's new Abyss next stream unless
[00:09:22] there's a unforeseen circumcision what
[00:09:26] unforeseen circumstance we will be
[00:09:29] trying to do the archon quest I don't
[00:09:31] know if I can do it all in one stream I
[00:09:33] don't know but I will try my best I
[00:09:35] watched Fang do the archon quest no I
[00:09:37] didn't like I was trying not to like
[00:09:38] spoil myself but I would like I saw she
[00:09:40] was doing it and then I kept like tuning
[00:09:42] in at random times she streamed for 10
[00:09:43] hours so I don't know how [ __ ] long
[00:09:46] this is gonna be to the normal stream
[00:09:47] however
[00:09:48] I don't know I but I haven't spoiled it
[00:09:52] um
[00:09:52] the only thing I know is like the people
[00:09:54] being like Oh Lydia
[00:09:56] shut the [ __ ] up no one cares random ass
[00:09:58] character with a top hat [ __ ] you sorry
[00:10:00] I like Lenny I just it doesn't matter
[00:10:02] but yeah so hopefully it's like six to
[00:10:04] eight hours and not more but I actually
[00:10:07] like Lydia I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:10:09] I just don't like the people that are
[00:10:10] like typing like oh his card is
[00:10:12] different in the picture
[00:10:14] freak you
[00:10:20] I'm not gonna stall I'm not gonna stall
[00:10:22] but yeah so hopefully it's not too long
[00:10:24] um but we will be doing that and then
[00:10:26] after we're gonna do account reviews I'm
[00:10:27] gonna try to release a calendar reforms
[00:10:29] I want to say today but knowing me it's
[00:10:31] gonna be tomorrow but last time I said
[00:10:32] that it was like a week ago so who
[00:10:34] [ __ ] knows but I want to release
[00:10:35] cursed account forms and whale forms
[00:10:37] like curse could be like free to play or
[00:10:38] anything and then whale as well and I
[00:10:41] want to see accounts that are scuffed
[00:10:42] and I can't clear the current abyss and
[00:10:44] then we're gonna fix them and spend
[00:10:45] resin on them and then that's gonna be
[00:10:47] the plan so that's all happening this
[00:10:48] week uh probably not gonna sleep tonight

[00:12:07] it's on the [ __ ] safety pins that's
[00:12:08] fine
[00:12:13] another hundred
[00:12:15] bits I'm not even reading your message
[00:12:17] to G1 Kevin Austin is a year and one
[00:12:20] month all right we're gonna start
[00:12:22] streaming no more stalling uh I'm
[00:12:23] installing streamer no more stalling uh
[00:12:26] dad hung imbiber Lune lunusi video is
[00:12:30] out so go watch that uh pretty Banger
[00:12:33] pretty Banger pretty banger
[00:12:38] um
[00:12:39] I've started a job so I've been pretty
[00:12:41] busy or I'm really happy to catch a
[00:12:43] stream I hope you're it's pretty Banger
[00:12:45] sucks a lot of work went into it and I
[00:12:47] re-edited it like a bunch of times to
[00:12:49] make sure all was good and it is all
[00:12:50] good so go watch it 359 oh dude they
[00:12:53] changed the trace though okay this isn't
[00:12:55] on me they changed one of the traces
[00:12:57] like this is on them like the trace okay
[00:13:01] so the trays okay you can't blame me for
[00:13:03] this the trace used to give criterate
[00:13:05] now gives crit damage they changed it
[00:13:07] what the [ __ ] do you want me to do
[00:13:09] I mean it is it doesn't matter like
[00:13:11] you're gonna level this anyway so like
[00:13:12] it doesn't actually matter but like they
[00:13:14] changed it the [ __ ] do you want from me
[00:13:16] what do you want me to do
[00:13:18] anyways it's fine I'll take the blame
[00:13:21] but yeah
[00:13:23] it was a typo I mean
[00:13:25] what am I supposed to do I mean it
[00:13:28] doesn't matter like
[00:13:29] you're gonna level it anyways so it's
[00:13:31] not like knowing about it changes
[00:13:33] something but now it's crit damage
[00:13:34] instead of crit rate that's the only
[00:13:36] difference
[00:13:37] all good is what it is
[00:13:43] um
[00:13:45] you know what okay I'm gonna do a thing
[00:13:47] where for once I'm actually gonna look
[00:13:48] at a random person's request okay for
[00:13:50] for the first you know what usually
[00:13:52] these people just randomly type their
[00:13:53] uids at random points in the Stream
[00:13:55] you're not even I can't even review you
[00:13:57] because you were not on the same server
[00:13:58] but I will literally pull up Anka just
[00:14:00] for you okay this better be the best
[00:14:02] [ __ ] build I've ever seen or else I'm
[00:14:04] going to be severely disappointed first
[00:14:06] of all I'm already disappointed because
[00:14:07] you farmed Vermillion so that's that's
[00:14:09] one L you already have one L second of
[00:14:10] all it's only two B's per million that's
[00:14:12] the second out though three strikes
[00:14:13] you're out Jade spear are you crowned
[00:14:15] you are crowned okay at least you're
[00:14:17] crowned c0 uh you have an okay amount of
[00:14:20] er let's look at your let's look at your
[00:14:22] pieces you have uh 12 crit damage dude
[00:14:25] enca [ __ ] with my brain nine crit rate
[00:14:27] 12 crit damage that's okay this feather
[00:14:29] is really good this Sans is a kind of a
[00:14:31] skill issue but it is what it is goblet
[00:14:33] on the wrong set you lost the 50 50.
[00:14:35] probably got a Chichi too that's a third
[00:14:38] strike but I'm not gonna kick you out
[00:14:39] yeah let's look at your circlet
[00:14:45] okay
[00:14:47] I have a question
[00:14:48] am I seeing something wrong or is your
[00:14:50] offset circlet
[00:14:54] a 3.9 crit rate circuit
[00:14:56] six months
[00:14:58] Julie thanks for the raid
[00:15:02] okay this is six months
[00:15:05] Chad you want me to expose you leave
[00:15:07] [ __ ] it I'm exposing you dude he
[00:15:08] literally dude you I don't know if you
[00:15:10] even know this you know you fell on you
[00:15:11] fell asleep on calling me yesterday do
[00:15:13] you know this we were playing I was
[00:15:15] playing Val with one of my friends and
[00:15:16] he was watching and then he fell asleep
[00:15:18] and then we left and then I had I
[00:15:21] disconnected you so you're not just like
[00:15:22] there alone
[00:15:28] it is uh yeah so this child is um I mean
[00:15:32] because you're a shout player I respect
[00:15:34] you I'm not gonna roast you too hard but
[00:15:36] this is like a
[00:15:37] the build itself it's like a seven to
[00:15:39] eight out of ten it's pretty good it's
[00:15:40] like an eight out of ten your offset
[00:15:42] piece being a glad piece that could be
[00:15:43] your onset but it's like bad makes me
[00:15:45] want to bring it down by 0.5 and then
[00:15:47] because you farm Vermilion and Echoes
[00:15:49] that's minus one and you don't even have
[00:15:51] a four Echoes that's another minus point
[00:15:52] five so what did I say six or seven
[00:15:54] let's say seven minus two that's five
[00:15:56] five out of ten but we'll round it up
[00:15:57] six out of ten there you go you're
[00:15:59] welcome

[00:21:10] think it's like
[00:21:11] and then it's like 180 degrees so it's
[00:21:13] an arrow pointing up it's a passive
[00:21:14] talent for example cookies uh uh a one
[00:21:19] passive it's either a 184 does have that
[00:21:21] okay it's not cookie it is
[00:21:26] what is that a [ __ ] Fireball
[00:21:31] okay what the [ __ ] usually by the like
[00:21:33] the halfway point I can get it but this
[00:21:35] one's weird
[00:21:36] the [ __ ] like Tomah no hutau like low HP
[00:21:40] buff
[00:21:41] how was I supposed to guess wait what
[00:21:43] the [ __ ] is this Geo electric fire it's
[00:21:48] a Geo Electro pyro reaction
[00:21:51] what the [ __ ] like maybe Goro and you
[00:21:53] have more Geo you get buffed okay no
[00:21:55] it's not
[00:21:56] try unlock the hint I kind of don't want
[00:21:57] to
[00:22:00] breaking good
[00:22:02] Albedo I mean it's a Geo character
[00:22:05] it doesn't make sense for us to be Noel
[00:22:07] it doesn't make sense for it to be the
[00:22:09] name or like it gives me Ito Vice I
[00:22:11] don't think this is Ito it could be
[00:22:14] to be Albedo could be wrongly like the
[00:22:16] resistance tread maybe no but that's not
[00:22:18] his shield
[00:22:18] this one is Shield this looks like a
[00:22:20] passive Talent
[00:22:22] but Jeong Lee's probably like I broke a
[00:22:24] convention no but he's a contractual man
[00:22:26] so he wouldn't break a convention true
[00:22:28] Ito would Ito would break a convention
[00:22:30] but John Lee would be like
[00:22:32] a walk would be nice
[00:22:36] do you know what's [ __ ] why do I not
[00:22:38] remember what Zhong Li does I mean okay
[00:22:40] I know what he does but like why do I
[00:22:42] not remember what his passives do like
[00:22:43] he's like okay shield and then reduce
[00:22:45] resistance and then petrify what the
[00:22:47] [ __ ] is a passive all right let me just
[00:22:48] click like
[00:22:50] I don't think it's Ito but this name
[00:22:51] gives me Ito vibes okay yeah I knew it
[00:22:54] oh wow that really [ __ ] helps okay I
[00:22:57] knew it wasn't it though wait why am I
[00:22:58] actually gonna lose this okay let me
[00:22:59] look what the [ __ ] is that what is this
[00:23:01] little fire thing bro
[00:23:06] bro what the actual [ __ ] is this
[00:23:13] oh wait I don't know what you okay I
[00:23:15] don't know what yunjin's abilities look
[00:23:17] like imma be real
[00:23:18] I mean that's not a normal ability it's
[00:23:20] a it's like a passive Talent
[00:23:23] okay if it's not yunjin if it is yunjin
[00:23:26] and I don't get her everyone will be mad
[00:23:27] at me I feel like okay you're gonna be
[00:23:30] like oh cheating but I'm I am going to
[00:23:32] lock in right now that I don't think
[00:23:34] this is wrongly so I'm just gonna make
[00:23:36] sure it's not John Lee just to prove
[00:23:38] that I'm right because I'm genuinely
[00:23:39] curious as to what his passes are okay
[00:23:41] let me read them okay yeah The Shield's
[00:23:42] ranked
[00:23:43] oh yeah this [ __ ] [ __ ] okay just
[00:23:45] scales on HP okay cool I just wanted to
[00:23:47] lock it in it's not cheating it's also
[00:23:48] make sure I was right because I knew I
[00:23:50] was right I just wanted to make sure
[00:23:51] breaking convention seems like something
[00:23:54] okay I don't think it's Albedo man is it
[00:23:57] me
[00:24:01] oh I'm just gonna guess the engine I
[00:24:03] think it's just the engine and if I
[00:24:05] don't guess engine everyone's gonna be
[00:24:06] mad at me
[00:24:08] it could be okay so who could it be it
[00:24:09] could be oh there's also Noel
[00:24:12] [ __ ] I don't know what Noel's passes
[00:24:14] look like dude why did I not play these
[00:24:16] characters
[00:24:17] no no man no
[00:24:30] that's not ning Wong [ __ ] it I'm too
[00:24:33] good I am the first try I'm Dugan hey
[00:24:36] hey
[00:24:40] okay but it's literally
[00:24:41] I just haven't traveled it's literally
[00:24:43] it's literally this is too easy because
[00:24:45] the thing with the thing with Union is
[00:24:46] is is is I know what her like default
[00:24:48] abilities look like but I promise you I
[00:24:50] promise you when I click on Eugene this
[00:24:52] is going to be
[00:24:53] this is going to be one of her passives
[00:24:55] it's not an ability you see a lot of see
[00:24:58] it's a [ __ ] passive that's why you
[00:25:01] don't see it exactly exactly exactly
[00:25:04] exactly exactly exactly
[00:25:22] all right well I actually popped off
[00:25:24] today we got this we got this we got

[00:29:57] I want to count Arizona
[00:30:06] not good
[00:30:09] oh by the way by the way by the way
[00:30:13] we got uh I rolled I did a little bit of
[00:30:15] artifact off stream not a lot I mostly
[00:30:17] did Talent books for Mr Lenny I did a
[00:30:19] lot of talent books I got three gold
[00:30:20] books in one claim I didn't even know
[00:30:22] that was possible
[00:30:24] um but I got one piece that I really
[00:30:26] wanted to roll and I'm recording I'm
[00:30:28] talking about this now because I got an
[00:30:30] artifact off stream
[00:30:32] and I'm saving it for stream because
[00:30:35] when we spent seven thousand resin in
[00:30:37] this domain we didn't really end on the
[00:30:39] most positive note so maybe this could
[00:30:42] turn the tides a little
[00:30:45] uh let me just find it I can't really
[00:30:47] remember where it is it was plus four
[00:30:48] yeah this piece was a plus zero and I
[00:30:52] plus four to see what the last stat was
[00:30:54] and it got crude rate so now it has crit
[00:30:57] damage crit rate ER HP
[00:31:00] so I'm thinking it's a little juicy now
[00:31:04] I do know that you guys are the problem
[00:31:06] though uh and when I rolled star rail
[00:31:08] relics offstream they were insane and
[00:31:11] when I rolled them on stream it was
[00:31:13] garbage so I'm gonna need all of you to
[00:31:15] just
[00:31:16] I don't know Look Away stop talking
[00:31:18] close your eyes close your ears just
[00:31:21] it's you guys are the problem so please
[00:31:22] just change something just just to help
[00:31:26] like
[00:31:27] yeah
[00:31:28] I don't know I feel like I feel like The
[00:31:30] Vibes you guys give like maybe they like
[00:31:32] Infuse into my artifacts and that's why
[00:31:34] I've been unlucky but now it's a new day
[00:31:36] I'm a new man and you're a new chat so I
[00:31:38] think I think we're gonna get good uh
[00:31:40] crit rolls crate 50 c for easy

[00:31:55] the roles I'm gonna close my screen wait
[00:31:58] I'm gonna fully close my screen while I
[00:32:00] roll
[00:32:01] and you guys will see when when you guys
[00:32:04] I'm Gonna Roll this without you guys
[00:32:05] being able to see and when we
[00:32:08] okay guys I know this looks bad okay but
[00:32:13] listen HP will be good for future
[00:32:15] functions okay maybe I'm the problem
[00:32:17] maybe I'm the problem
[00:32:20] um well
[00:32:28] should I keep this like this this is
[00:32:31] like a it's like a kokomi piece it's
[00:32:34] like a nilu it's like it's like a kakomi
[00:32:37] piece
[00:32:50] yeah well unlucky unlucky
[00:32:58] even though she has it has crit dude
[00:33:00] Michael Comey you do don't understand my
[00:33:03] critical me
[00:33:08] laughs
[00:33:12] hmm
[00:33:19] chat
[00:33:23] chat are you thinking what I'm thinking
[00:33:31] what if I told you
[00:33:33] there was a character you can put in a
[00:33:36] team right that would give Xiao who
[00:33:39] missed a zyx at PSI zero triple let's
[00:33:42] say
[00:33:45] let's say 20 attack with pyro resonance
[00:33:51] minimum
[00:33:53] of 10
[00:33:57] above
[00:33:58] elegy
[00:34:00] or favonius
[00:34:04] hey
[00:34:05] hey I just don't know what artifacts
[00:34:08] that she could go because we can't go
[00:34:09] miloth on her but as far as not by
[00:34:10] Millis
[00:34:11] uh I mean I guess I could just go like
[00:34:13] [ __ ] wait can we go can we go emblem
[00:34:18] we could probably go emblem right wait
[00:34:20] we can go envelope you'll be away in a
[00:34:22] second wait a second let me cook
[00:34:24] wait a second
[00:34:27] dude that uptime's not even bad the
[00:34:29] problem with who towel support is that
[00:34:31] her upside was like eight seconds or
[00:34:32] something like ten eight it wasn't long
[00:34:34] but yeah
[00:34:37] do you miss 15 right that said 15. 15
[00:34:41] seconds
[00:34:43] I am currently doing his talents should
[00:34:46] I stop at level seven talents or going
[00:34:48] level eight is worth wait for who
[00:34:51] uh yeah definitely got eight talents
[00:34:54] honestly nine well for Lenny all his
[00:34:57] talents are important but you could um
[00:34:59] like you don't need to level them all at
[00:35:01] once you can just like
[00:35:04] you do like eight seven seven or eight
[00:35:05] well ideally you want them all eight or
[00:35:07] nine yeah it's worth it well talents are
[00:35:09] always more important than like
[00:35:10] artifacts
[00:35:11] in terms of like resin efficiency
[00:35:13] because like your artifacts might be dog
[00:35:14] [ __ ] right like I spent 7K and I don't
[00:35:16] even have a good set here whereas like
[00:35:18] if I spent 7K resin on Talent books I
[00:35:20] could probably Crown all my characters
[00:35:24] all right watch this watch this team
[00:35:26] watch this team
[00:35:27] you do this then this then this
[00:35:36] dude 142k dude
[00:35:43] wait 165. no no that's actually going
[00:35:46] yeah that's actually me above
[00:35:52] dude
[00:35:56] domain buff shut the frick up man it's
[00:35:58] the yo me a buff
[00:36:06] here we go
[00:36:12] foreign
[00:36:20] dude listen listen listen okay listen
[00:36:24] listen you get dude dude it's 10 attack
[00:36:28] for free you can't do constellations
[00:36:30] help at all
[00:36:33] uh no
[00:36:35] it's four seconds on that
[00:36:39] okay no
[00:36:42] no no
[00:36:47] wait is there another Power character I
[00:36:49] could use wait let me think let me cook
[00:36:50] I mean I could throwing kills Yen fade
[00:36:52] but that's like
[00:36:56] she also has a shield
[00:37:00] wait what about the Luke no the Luke
[00:37:02] dude dude
[00:37:03] how is this a palette by the way how is
[00:37:06] Deluxe charge attack stamina cost is
[00:37:08] decreased by 50 an actual talent how did
[00:37:11] this go through if he was a new
[00:37:13] character we'd be complaining about this
[00:37:15] how is this even a thing
[00:37:20] I don't have C4 clean
[00:37:36] I use dilute charge that call the time
[00:37:39] it helps me away
[00:37:44] oh what if we pick up the pepper from
[00:37:46] Shang Ling
[00:37:47] what if we pick up the pepper
[00:37:50] what if we pick up the pepper true what
[00:37:54] if I just play shangling and pick up the
[00:37:55] pepper
[00:38:01] also I think Lenny made um made this
[00:38:05] actually kind of cracked
[00:38:07] cause like usually like yeah this would
[00:38:09] help like double Pyro hutao
[00:38:12] but like outside of that you're not I
[00:38:13] don't know I guess some people are
[00:38:15] playing mono pyro but Lydia actually
[00:38:17] likes this he cracked she only got
[00:38:19] another buff
[00:38:28] I don't know what I'm doing anymore
[00:38:29] let's go do Abyss uh we still have to
[00:38:31] spend resin but for now I think we have
[00:38:33] this
[00:38:36] is lava Walker good for Lenny love
[00:38:38] Walker's okay if you don't imagine
[00:38:39] you'll see but it's kind of like running
[00:38:41] iaco without business Trader it's like
[00:38:43] Mary chausi gives you so much
[00:38:47] so many stats that it's kind of dumb not
[00:38:49] to use it but if you don't have it then
[00:38:52] lava Walker Vermillion [ __ ] two piece
[00:38:54] two piece or any other stats I mentioned
[00:38:56] they're all decent like the scarra set
[00:38:58] like there's a bunch that are fine
[00:38:59] pretty sure Echoes no echo's a normal
[00:39:01] attacks no might not Echoes but like
[00:39:03] there's a bunch of sets that are like
[00:39:04] fine
[00:39:05] um
[00:39:07] but it's like they're a lot worse
[00:39:16] what was I gonna do I don't remember oh
[00:39:19] oh oh oh oh oh oh where's the knee
[00:39:21] where's Lenny where's the knee where's
[00:39:22] Lenny where's Lenny Chad I actually
[00:39:24] farmed I farmed boom we picked the
[00:39:26] flowers we killed the crab and I got
[00:39:29] [ __ ] Talent books yes sir I can
[00:39:31] literally actually level my Lenny's so
[00:39:33] let's go send them
[00:39:41] oh no
[00:39:43] he's Logic the boss I haven't seen any
[00:39:44] of this yet so there's a six appreciate
[00:39:46] it
[00:39:48] level 90 faru I mean she's fully
[00:39:51] ascended
[00:39:52] like yeah her attack kinda matters but
[00:39:55] not really that's fine
[00:39:57] I do want to level her skill though I
[00:40:00] think doing a skill damage farzan build
[00:40:01] is kind of based
[00:40:11] um
[00:40:13] cool it
[00:40:22] no Crystal flies um
[00:40:29] shut the [ __ ] up

[00:41:04] okay
[00:41:06] whatever this game sucks I was wondering
[00:41:10] if it is worth building
[00:41:12] C6 Dory child a meme
[00:41:16] a Forbidden Knowledge team just like
[00:41:18] just casually
[00:41:19] there's 11 months Max
[00:41:21] Bobby there's a two one okay the problem
[00:41:23] with Dory
[00:41:24] okay look okay the thing is if you look
[00:41:28] at a character like kooky right
[00:41:30] oh you look at a character like Oogie
[00:41:32] and you look at her like skill right
[00:41:34] you're like oh this lasts 12 seconds
[00:41:36] with a 15 second cooldown three seconds
[00:41:38] of downtime that's not even bad
[00:41:40] it's not
[00:41:42] but you might also be like you know
[00:41:43] maybe there's a constellation that makes
[00:41:45] it a hundred percent of time then you
[00:41:47] check and oh her C2 gives her 100 off
[00:41:49] time and then when you look at someone
[00:41:51] like
[00:41:52] uh we'll just call her D when you look
[00:41:54] at someone like d you're like oh 20
[00:41:57] second cooldown pulse generation that's
[00:41:59] eight seconds of downtime oh but there's
[00:42:00] probably a constellation like cookies
[00:42:02] that makes it a hundreds of time or a
[00:42:04] bit closer
[00:42:05] no no
[00:42:07] no no no no no
[00:42:11] huh she still has eight seconds of down
[00:42:13] time and so you kind of yeah yeah
[00:42:19] you know
[00:42:21] yeah
[00:42:26] have fun with this game
[00:42:28] [ __ ] I'm in Japanese okay we have to
[00:42:30] change it oh but I'm gonna am I gonna
[00:42:31] play Lenny oh dude why can't I have one
[00:42:34] character why can't you assign a
[00:42:37] language to a character
[00:42:38] whatever it's fine that's actually a
[00:42:40] genius idea by the way write that down
[00:42:41] right touch it down that should be in
[00:42:42] game
[00:42:45] it's like even if I'm in English I want
[00:42:47] my Bennett to Boke into boken
[00:42:56] no I forgot
[00:43:09] play yeah and face streamer
[00:43:17] I'm going to make these
[00:43:19] boom boom we'll make 125 sucrose you got
[00:43:23] me you got me sucrose
[00:43:25] you got me sucrose
[00:43:29] that's Universe episode 11. appreciate
[00:43:31] it
[00:43:36] and now we gain five crit rate
[00:43:39] some artists stub genshing characters
[00:43:42] into French we
[00:43:46] will try a level I should probably level
[00:43:48] this right
[00:43:49] I want to love those normals but I also
[00:43:52] think that his burst like booming on
[00:43:54] enemies is kind of cool
[00:43:57] hmm
[00:44:02] probably skill
[00:44:03] I don't have enough to do both
[00:44:05] because I cannot play him quick swappy
[00:44:07] like even if Char Trot is like Optimal I
[00:44:09] only charge it like once or twice or
[00:44:10] three times so it's like I feel like I
[00:44:12] don't do it as much as you should
[00:44:14] you made a guide yeah but I don't play
[00:44:16] him optimally like I I know how to play
[00:44:18] multiplayer I just don't I don't know I
[00:44:19] don't find it as fun it's not just that
[00:44:21] it's also like if you're like turbo High
[00:44:24] investment it's kind of like it's kind
[00:44:25] of like child or Eula it's like
[00:44:26] sometimes when you're turbo High
[00:44:27] investment you just gotta kill the
[00:44:29] enemies
[00:44:30] like let's say you double swirl with
[00:44:32] child and then you bet it alt and
[00:44:33] they're pyro and then you burst on child
[00:44:34] there's like 500k you don't need to do a
[00:44:36] whole [ __ ] rotation they're just dead
[00:44:38] you're like oh and then you start next
[00:44:39] half with no energy and you're like [ __ ]
[00:44:41] foreign
[00:44:58] Worth to get yes but because you're
[00:45:00] asking that question the answer is
[00:45:02] probably no because this means you don't
[00:45:03] really want him but you think he's good
[00:45:05] so you want him however there's a bunch
[00:45:07] of new characters that are probably
[00:45:08] going to be very good coming soon so you
[00:45:10] may want to save your Primos
[00:45:12] are 15. he is good though
[00:45:15] mine is 15 balls
[00:45:22] thank you I don't know I remember I

[01:03:13] could use this on my Albert hyphen uh or
[01:03:16] Kuching or ayato like well not really
[01:03:18] ayato because it's skill and like yeah
[01:03:20] but I could use it on someone
[01:03:23] uh I use it on someone probably I'll
[01:03:25] hide them because I have so many good
[01:03:27] sword users that need so many swords
[01:03:31] yeah talking stick's not as bad as you
[01:03:33] think it doesn't matter though because
[01:03:35] serpent spine is like stupid broken
[01:03:39] because it's like even if all of this
[01:03:41] works it's serpents mine is just serpent
[01:03:42] spine
[01:03:53] and then sacrificial yade
[01:03:55] okay this is like no leaks at all but
[01:03:59] this is clearly a weapon that's made for
[01:04:01] a character that's not out like it just
[01:04:02] has to be because no one in the game
[01:04:04] right now can use em HP and crit rate
[01:04:06] literally like the way this is worded
[01:04:09] there's just no one like it's like a
[01:04:10] [ __ ] baiju weapon or like a kokomi
[01:04:12] weapon which doesn't want crit rate like
[01:04:13] it's really weird
[01:04:15] so it's like
[01:04:19] yeah it's gonna be on a future character
[01:04:23] so I could wait and claim this later
[01:04:30] um
[01:04:32] it could be a crit call me weapon but we
[01:04:35] already have Royal grimoire and I don't
[01:04:37] want to replace it because we just
[01:04:38] bought Royal grimoire
[01:04:45] um but I kind of want wolfang
[01:04:52] also
[01:05:00] okay people that tell me oh he knows oh
[01:05:02] this okay listen if one of the
[01:05:04] characters I really like like is a
[01:05:07] catalyst I'm gonna get their signature
[01:05:08] like I have Al Haytham signature I have
[01:05:11] shallow signature I have a few of my
[01:05:13] like most of like my favorite characters
[01:05:14] I have their signature they have sinos
[01:05:17] Abu towels
[01:05:19] so like
[01:05:22] yeah
[01:05:25] also yeah
[01:05:31] you don't have kokomi's donut kokomis I
[01:05:33] do have kokomi signature I have
[01:05:35] thrilling Tales
[01:05:36] that is her signature
[01:05:47] sino's signature and the dudes benched
[01:05:50] my Sino is not benched stop saying I'm
[01:05:53] sorry there's like 60 [ __ ] characters
[01:05:55] I play I I can't listen he's not benched
[01:05:59] he's not well he's not I just can't play
[01:06:02] everyone at the same time
[01:06:09] best BP weapon in your humble opinion
[01:06:12] servants buying service mine is still
[01:06:16] the best but uh of the new ones I like
[01:06:18] wolfang I like ballads sounds okay like
[01:06:21] it's a charge attack weapon but overall
[01:06:23] it's just pretty decent and then Jade
[01:06:26] could be really good but it's not good
[01:06:27] on anyone right now and then Talking
[01:06:28] Stick is Talking Stick
[01:06:33] is the rate
[01:06:41] No More Mr Nice Guy am I getting wolfang
[01:06:44] or am I waiting till later to see if I
[01:06:46] get one I'll get sacrificial Jade or not
[01:06:47] because those are the only two I would
[01:06:49] go for it right now I want the Trident
[01:06:51] eventually
[01:06:52] and I'm not going to refine weapons till
[01:06:53] I have all of at least four I don't
[01:06:56] think I'm gonna refine any until I get
[01:06:57] wolf Jade Fjord and then one of the
[01:06:59] other two I don't think I want Talking
[01:07:01] Stick because and this one looks as is
[01:07:03] decent so I mean Talking Stick is
[01:07:05] [ __ ] funny I kind of want to get it
[01:07:06] but I kind of want to get it man it's
[01:07:09] actually funny
[01:07:12] oh interesting here the base stats are
[01:07:15] 42 6 42 6 42 6 4 6 on the death match I
[01:07:18] remember it's more could rate but these
[01:07:20] ones are 42 6 44 41 8 is like more
[01:07:24] different
[01:07:42] I'm not gonna R5 sack Jade bro I will
[01:07:46] not R5 this for like at least a almost a
[01:07:49] year a battle pass is what like how many
[01:07:52] days like 45
[01:07:54] it's like a battle pass per patch let's
[01:07:56] say I get one two three four five and
[01:07:59] then four more to refine that's nine
[01:08:01] battle passes
[01:08:03] that is nine battle passes
[01:08:05] that isn't
[01:08:06] it's one for patch right
[01:08:09] nine that is 4.9 dude 5.0 is gonna be
[01:08:12] out 5.0 is gonna be out literally we're
[01:08:15] gonna be in [ __ ] not land
[01:08:18] or whatever regions next I don't know
[01:08:24] we're literally gonna be in a different
[01:08:25] region before I have a R5
[01:08:34] you don't need any of them so the most
[01:08:36] interesting instead of the strongest you
[01:08:37] just want me to get Talking Stick
[01:08:38] [ __ ] I want wolfang because I
[01:08:41] use a lot of Sword characters I use too
[01:08:43] many like my ayato is on like
[01:08:45] sacrificial right now I have too many
[01:08:48] is really like interesting though but I
[01:08:53] don't think it would okay
[01:08:56] let's say I want to use soccer field
[01:08:58] Jade in like a patch or two let's say
[01:09:01] there will be another battle pass by
[01:09:03] then
[01:09:04] even if that's the case there will be
[01:09:06] another battle pass
[01:09:15] [ __ ] dude I have to think you have to
[01:09:18] get missed Twitter next time around yeah
[01:09:19] I actually do I probably should have
[01:09:20] pulled for it
[01:09:25] dude I don't I I came into the stream
[01:09:27] wanting to get Wolfgang now I'm like no
[01:09:29] I don't know
[01:09:31] little bro fighting okay I also dude I
[01:09:33] have like 56 wins to this though with
[01:09:36] satussies
[01:09:46] this is also a very furry sword
[01:09:58] perfect for you then shut the [ __ ] up
[01:10:07] who do you use it on let me check really
[01:10:09] quick let me check really quick all
[01:10:10] right let's look at our sword users
[01:10:12] so we have ayato that I use we have
[01:10:14] Albert uh here let me go filter let me
[01:10:18] go sword boom so we use what the [ __ ] we
[01:10:21] use casual we use Bennett we use the
[01:10:23] Lindy we use kaching we use our heighten
[01:10:25] we use nilu we use Kyle we use kuki we
[01:10:27] use Kirara
[01:10:28] Albedo Gene we use ayaka we use ayato
[01:10:32] and we use dendro MC and we're using Cho
[01:10:41] thank you
[01:10:44] okay Lo-Fi would probably go to kaching
[01:10:46] I'll I'll hide them and use the new
[01:10:48] sword
[01:10:49] or the Nissan and then I mean I also
[01:10:52] have an R5 box sword though that I'm not
[01:10:54] using I can also just level this and
[01:10:55] give it to kaching
[01:10:57] I don't know why my Blackstone is not
[01:10:58] leveled I'm gonna be honest it's
[01:10:59] description it's level [ __ ] 60 and
[01:11:01] it's R5 I actually the more I think
[01:11:04] about this what am I doing yeah
[01:11:06] why is my kitchen
[01:11:08] Club resting on his shoulder traversing
[01:11:11] the rugged wild swear dragons roamed the
[01:11:13] Wilderness of Hot Springs so mid it is
[01:11:17] man I know but like
[01:11:20] oh [ __ ]
[01:11:28] blacks are on ayato okay but the problem
[01:11:30] that I though is is is is is is my
[01:11:33] iPhone's like top one with a crit damage
[01:11:36] weapon so like my Ito is is one of the
[01:11:38] is like literally the best what the [ __ ]
[01:11:40] is attacking me
[01:11:43] my eyes was like literally the best Ito
[01:11:45] worldwide International if I'm on a crit
[01:11:47] damage weapon
[01:11:49] like if I if I do this
[01:11:51] I know it's
[01:12:04] if I do this my I told look at this look
[01:12:07] at how disgusting this is 82 274. it's
[01:12:10] [ __ ] stupid but like I don't have an
[01:12:12] act like this weapon's not actually that
[01:12:13] good on him you wanna like missed it or
[01:12:15] something but it's okay
[01:12:33] all right I gotta use the leaderboard I
[01:12:34] don't know it changes all the time but I
[01:12:36] also changed my artifacts all the time
[01:12:37] so if I'm not one I could probably
[01:12:38] change it to be one I think we're two
[01:12:40] though wait never mind I took I have the
[01:12:42] wrong build on them

[01:13:07] see four thundering Fury you're gonna
[01:13:09] already know just by looking at him that

[01:36:37] do you want to enter the Forgotten Hall
[01:36:42] so we have pyro damage bonus we have
[01:36:44] hydro damage bonus uh this clearly means
[01:36:46] we want to play Xiao
[01:36:48] um let's say second half we play uh Big
[01:36:51] L so we'll play Big L where's L play L
[01:36:54] we'll play L with uh let's say Bennett
[01:36:56] let's say kazua uh actually no let's say
[01:36:59] Lynette
[01:37:01] and let's say Jonathan Lee no let's do a
[01:37:04] day actually we'll do wait that's strong
[01:37:06] Yoon how the [ __ ] did Chong Yun get here
[01:37:07] whatever we're playing Chong Yoon I
[01:37:09] don't care I'm not changing my team
[01:37:14] okay never mind this looks scary we're
[01:37:16] gonna bench Chong Yoon uh we're gonna do
[01:37:19] um
[01:37:21] Maybe casua
[01:37:23] and wrongly we'll play a real team
[01:37:26] first half
[01:37:30] just in case these are annoying because
[01:37:32] I saw some people complaining just in
[01:37:34] case they're annoying we'll just put
[01:37:35] venti here because then if anything's
[01:37:37] annoying the game will be easy uh but if
[01:37:39] not you know we'll see how it is we'll
[01:37:41] do Xiao Venti yilon
[01:37:44] and kokomi
[01:37:49] I don't know what weapon my elon's on
[01:37:51] because she's not on Fab and she's not
[01:37:52] on elegy so I don't know what bow she
[01:37:55] could possibly be on
[01:38:04] seven five stars Pepe dude shut the [ __ ]
[01:38:07] okay [ __ ] you
[01:38:09] I mean we could play this looks easy as
[01:38:11] [ __ ] I can't lie
[01:38:13] this actually looks easy as [ __ ] we
[01:38:14] could do a hero just for you just for
[01:38:16] you we'll do
[01:38:18] just for you we'll do
[01:38:22] what can we do we'll do call me official
[01:38:26] no we'll do sucrose special
[01:38:31] and then
[01:38:35] aventi
[01:38:38] Ally
[01:38:41] now can we use ayato
[01:38:44] but my Ito is like on dog show
[01:38:46] artificial or a weapon right now is
[01:38:47] artifacts are good
[01:39:02] [ __ ] it we don't need good artifacts uh
[01:39:04] we'll do think Joe we'll do things
[01:39:06] official
[01:39:07] and then a Healer and venti I think
[01:39:10] where's venti venti he's not on it he's
[01:39:13] not geared but it should be fine and
[01:39:14] then a Healer
[01:39:21] yeah yeah [ __ ] it
[01:39:24] who's our DPS wait we don't have one
[01:39:46] I have a better idea
[01:39:48] look at this Mark
[01:39:54] 11-1 this should be a joke it's [ __ ]
[01:39:57] floor 11. we have to protect the
[01:39:58] monolith which is annoying but it'll be
[01:39:59] fine
[01:40:00] what is your team what do you mean it's
[01:40:02] a child bloom
[01:40:04] this you guys are ready for this team
[01:40:06] much
[01:40:18] it's child Gloom what's wrong with Shao
[01:40:21] bloom
[01:40:22] that's it
[01:40:26] I just brought Hydro because we've got
[01:40:28] Hydro damage runners in the store so
[01:40:30] you know maybe we'll need [ __ ] Hydro
[01:40:35] yeah event is broken here
[01:41:03] okay I'm only going to use kazoo
[01:41:05] abandoned here I won't even talk to
[01:41:07] anyone else I won't talk about uh to
[01:41:09] anyone other than cause or Bennett this
[01:41:11] entire floor
[01:41:26] [ __ ] you

[01:41:37] 20 left we're fine
[01:41:38] Rock's fine
[01:41:41] yeah we're fine
[01:41:43] I want to try the first half without
[01:41:44] venti I don't think I made that too easy
[01:41:47] oh good
[01:41:56] what the [ __ ] is this
[01:41:58] bubbler seahorse
[01:42:10] No Way new entry
[01:42:21] oh my [ __ ] it's the emblem domain
[01:42:25] Google
[01:42:32] dude
[01:42:52] wait that actually looks scary for an
[01:42:54] abyss 11 though I'm not even kidding I
[01:42:57] feel like if we play our Asia account
[01:42:58] this might be scary
[01:43:01] oh my God
[01:43:03] what that's doing this thing's kind of
[01:43:04] cute
[01:43:14] how'd that guy get over there
[01:43:32] where's the show time I got you watch
[01:43:34] this watch us watch this it's gonna be
[01:43:36] Showtime watch watch watch

[01:43:45] wait is this low-key a little harsh for
[01:43:47] a [ __ ] floor 11 is it not Am I
[01:43:49] Dreaming or is this kind of harsh for a
[01:43:51] [ __ ] floor 11. I feel like this is
[01:43:52] more annoying than the last ones
[01:43:57] especially if you're not no what do you
[01:44:00] mean no
[01:44:02] okay last one wasn't last one like
[01:44:04] [ __ ] piss easy I mean this one's not
[01:44:06] hard but like I feel like if I'm on a
[01:44:08] noob account like they might just one
[01:44:09] shot me
[01:44:12] I know sometimes there's like the dendro
[01:44:14] chicken or like the Thundering manif or
[01:44:15] whatever here but I don't know those are
[01:44:17] kind of annoying
[01:44:18] foreign
[01:44:27] I guess that is definitely true you can
[01:44:30] just dodge
[01:44:37] all right I'm blooming
[01:44:42] sorry
[01:44:45] you guys are pretty easy
[01:45:03] I wanna die there and Dodge that
[01:45:08] no no
[01:45:12] yes I baited him I baited him out to me
[01:45:17] yeah massive bonuses yeah that is true
[01:45:19] you need to get a lot of damage bonuses
[01:45:21] hello Mr Primo Geo Bishop
[01:45:24] I miss you man
[01:45:26] how you been
[01:45:29] I tested uh Lily against you was
[01:45:32] actually pretty fun so now you're dead
[01:45:34] Okay somehow you live that
[01:45:37] you're a tanky [ __ ]
[01:45:45] well just like
[01:45:49] well
[01:45:52] all right easy
[01:45:58] why is your venti so ass
[01:46:01] don't talk about venti like that
[01:46:03] don't talk about venti like that
[01:46:05] op Lenny yes our line is kind of cracked
[01:46:07] and he he's losing like 10 to 20 DPS
[01:46:10] because he's on the wrong set
[01:46:12] so it's actually pretty [ __ ] huge how
[01:46:13] much actually I think it's like close to
[01:46:14] 20 yeah
[01:46:19] uh our venti is currently on
[01:46:31] yeah I'm sorry I'm actually sorry I'm
[01:46:35] actually sorry okay if there's like an
[01:46:37] auto equip artifacts I would click it
[01:46:39] right now if there's like a preset I
[01:46:40] would click it right now
[01:46:42] yeah veggie doesn't need gear he's just
[01:46:43] he does his job without you know what
[01:46:45] let's give him like a what's like a
[01:46:47] no I can't give him a thought what's
[01:46:49] like a weird set you would never see
[01:46:50] let's give him like echoes
[01:46:54] give us some Er though
[01:46:56] this let's do like uh this or this one I
[01:47:00] guess you know
[01:47:19] okay
[01:47:20] whatever
[01:47:28] all right cool
[01:47:30] floor 12 for this floor only if the
[01:47:32] leyline flow will be normal
[01:47:40] thank you
[01:47:44] foreign
[01:47:50] why are you guys laughing at my crib
[01:47:51] ratio okay listen if okay you know I'm
[01:47:54] about to expose your hypocrisy right now
[01:47:56] look look first of all over 100 crit
[01:47:59] means we have eight percent chance to do
[01:48:01] a double hit that is true second of all
[01:48:03] if this was 70 144 if this was my let's
[01:48:07] say this was my ratio right let's say my
[01:48:08] event you look like this you'll be like
[01:48:09] oh Paul that's pretty good but now if I
[01:48:12] have the exact same crit damage but more
[01:48:14] crit rate suddenly it's bad oh now this
[01:48:16] is bad oh suddenly this is bad freak you
[01:48:20] Frick you Frick you
[01:48:26] all right floor 12.
[01:48:29] Let's uh so we're now gonna do the font
[01:48:31] 10 floor 12. for the first time I
[01:48:33] haven't watched anyone do it uh
[01:48:35] obviously I'm looking at the enemies now
[01:48:37] we checked them you know there's enemies
[01:48:40] um I don't know how important Lucia is
[01:48:42] because these guys are Numa and then
[01:48:44] this dude has a shield I know like I
[01:48:46] know against the Overworld boss you can
[01:48:48] like Lenny e Lynette not Lenny Lynette
[01:48:50] Ian who's the cryo Shield I assume it's
[01:48:52] the same here
[01:48:53] but I don't actually know
[01:48:55] it might not be the same I don't know
[01:48:57] we'll figure it out but it's probably
[01:48:59] gonna be I haven't heard people like
[01:49:00] crying about it so I'm assuming it's
[01:49:02] fine but I am also so talented that even
[01:49:05] if it's incredibly hard we're gonna
[01:49:07] clear without dying we're gonna clear it
[01:49:08] like literally with any team any
[01:49:11] character any anything and it'll just be
[01:49:13] easy we can Gamba chat on if we're gonna
[01:49:15] Force first time clear it with zero
[01:49:17] death zero resets because honestly I
[01:49:20] think we can do it very easily I can
[01:49:22] pick my teams before we Gamba
[01:49:26] and then we'll do the Gamba so I think
[01:49:28] usually I play them usually I always do
[01:49:30] I'll hit them Chow uh this Abyss looks
[01:49:32] like we need something to break a cryo
[01:49:35] Shield or usia I guess but it looks like
[01:49:37] you want pyro second there's even like
[01:49:39] cryo here Hydro it looks like you want
[01:49:41] Pyro
[01:49:42] and then so shangling op up and then
[01:49:44] first off this guy you want Hydro
[01:49:47] uh um so it looks like you want Hydro
[01:49:49] pyro in that order
[01:49:55] but I'm not actually sure
[01:49:58] I don't know what these guys mechanics
[01:49:59] are but you want Hydra there
[01:50:03] we could play retro version true
[01:50:05] actually
[01:50:07] foreign
[01:50:21] okay
[01:50:23] Hydro will be like this probably to like
[01:50:26] this team
[01:50:29] I do this and then pyro will do like
[01:50:32] Lenny I guess
[01:50:46] I would do uh Zhang Lee for a shield but
[01:50:49] I kind of want Dale because it's funnier
[01:50:50] but then my Lenny's definitely gonna die
[01:50:52] and everyone's gonna lose Channel points
[01:50:55] but if I use strongly it's kind of like
[01:50:56] cheating I want to give doubters a
[01:50:58] chance you know I want to give doubters
[01:51:00] a Fighting Chance
[01:51:15] oh we're supposed to use Fishel for
[01:51:18] footage [ __ ] wait we're gonna use fish
[01:51:19] oil second off yeah probably second no
[01:51:21] but then it's an overload team first you
[01:51:23] only want hydro which means we could
[01:51:24] ring Elektra as well okay I guess we
[01:51:26] don't play shall we'll do official
[01:51:31] or I'll hide them
[01:51:34] I'm not for an Ito Team ayato official
[01:51:45] nahida
[01:51:49] kooky
[01:51:55] um
[01:51:56] maybe not
[01:52:10] I kind of want to play
[01:52:13] um I guess we don't need a Nemo here
[01:52:14] like these guys you might want to group
[01:52:15] but who the [ __ ] cares this is one enemy
[01:52:17] this is one and I think enemy there
[01:52:19] might be more than one magu but it
[01:52:20] doesn't matter I think it's just one
[01:52:22] okay
[01:52:24] let me go to ayato
[01:52:33] she's going black with the letter oh no
[01:52:35] but I think just to be on a four-star
[01:52:36] weapon oh give them
[01:52:50] you can [ __ ] Skyward I don't really
[01:52:52] care whatever it doesn't matter
[01:52:56] I don't think we're gonna lose
[01:52:58] please don't grieve We're not gonna lose
[01:52:59] dude
[01:53:01] I have never lost anything in my life
[01:53:18] okay if we want to do a great chat can I
[01:53:20] just if we want to actually do a
[01:53:22] official showcase we want to play either
[01:53:24] like Beto or kaching I don't know if I
[01:53:26] can play them here you can also do like
[01:53:27] yai but I feel like you need Hydra for
[01:53:29] this we could do like a hot like a
[01:53:32] we can also do this
[01:53:34] like yeah I like quick boom
[01:53:38] um
[01:53:41] but
[01:53:49] I'm more down to play ayato so we're
[01:53:50] just gonna play Ito I'm gonna stop
[01:53:51] gearing and we're just gonna send this
[01:53:53] team
[01:53:55] and then second half we're gonna do why
[01:53:57] don't you have a video showing your
[01:53:58] whole account with all characters and
[01:53:59] stuff I actually want to do that that's
[01:54:01] in my video list but I'm gonna have to
[01:54:03] gear every character first like make
[01:54:06] sure everyone is good because right now
[01:54:08] if you go to the random character I have
[01:54:09] it's gonna look [ __ ] but I think I
[01:54:12] will do that at some point soon kinda
[01:54:14] soon in a year five years who knows am I
[01:54:17] at some point second half we're gonna
[01:54:18] play was he about to play Lenny yes
[01:54:20] Lenny Lenny
[01:54:22] Bennett
[01:54:24] and uh Jeong Li for smart day out if
[01:54:27] we're dumb luckily for you we're dumb
[01:54:33] and then we'll do a four star only clear
[01:54:35] after this
[01:54:46] let me look at the prediction really
[01:54:48] quick to see what it's like oh for once
[01:54:51] there's more Believers than doubters
[01:54:52] that has to be a [ __ ] first time
[01:54:55] 74-28 who's the biggest doubter
[01:54:58] Alterra 76 biggest believer
[01:55:00] swirly vote swirly
[01:55:03] okay well
[01:55:08] we are not gonna die don't worry
[01:55:11] my Cookie's on full yam so she's not
[01:55:13] gonna be healing much and we have Daya
[01:55:14] here so we're gonna die so there's
[01:55:16] actually decent chance that both teams
[01:55:17] die by the way just so you know our
[01:55:18] Lenny doesn't actually have a shield and
[01:55:19] he's very squishy so he might legit just
[01:55:21] die because we're very squishy so if I'm
[01:55:23] smart I go wrongly here and there is no
[01:55:26] chance for a skill issue but we're gonna
[01:55:28] go Dale
[01:55:30] because it's funnier
[01:55:36] because it's too easy if I go wrongly
[01:55:38] like genuinely I'm not even kidding
[01:55:40] Jeong Li ignores mechanics
[01:55:42] but if I go there then I might not know
[01:55:44] that we can you know there's a chance of
[01:55:46] dying but since I'm so talented I'll
[01:55:48] make sure I don't die
[01:55:49] and then it is what it is
[01:55:52] why I say it like that I don't know
[01:55:55] [ __ ] we're overcast on crude right now
[01:55:56] for Lenny but whatever
[01:56:00] are you ready Chad are you ready I'm
[01:56:02] ready
[01:56:04] my dad's awake by the way so he's gonna
[01:56:06] hear me yell
[01:56:08] all good
[01:56:09] cool it
[01:56:27] yeah
[01:56:31] wait I Loki okay don't laugh at me or
[01:56:34] wrong I meant the ayato burst don't
[01:56:36] laugh at me but it's been so long since
[01:56:37] I found this guy that I low-key forget
[01:56:38] how to dodge his uh okay I was on that
[01:56:41] one but look he forgot how to dodge the
[01:56:43] like um
[01:56:44] this attack I think I got it I think I
[01:56:46] got it so it's as soon as I boom I'm
[01:56:48] actually cracked I've killed this guy
[01:56:49] too many times I remember I didn't mean
[01:56:51] to official burst by there doesn't this
[01:56:52] quick
[01:56:56] it's fine we're good
[01:56:59] we're taking nice and so take it nice
[01:57:00] and slow he's gonna Dash backwards here
[01:57:02] but we just did that for iframes oh he
[01:57:04] didn't even Dash backwards I shoot
[01:57:06] something officials but as I said I do
[01:57:07] not really care so we're just uh
[01:57:09] preserving rhb Dodge that I didn't dodge
[01:57:10] it sucks how are you so bad at the enemy
[01:57:12] you fought a thousand times shut up no
[01:57:14] one asked you plus I own you
[01:57:20] it's fine we're chilling we're taking it
[01:57:22] easy
[01:57:31] it's a new pattern kenkey yeah usually
[01:57:33] they Dash backward after like
[01:57:35] it's like he'll do those
[01:57:36] then you attack them and he dashes
[01:57:38] backward unless you like I think you
[01:57:40] have to if you hit him
[01:57:41] afterwards the wall so he doesn't Dash
[01:57:42] again that was the old kinky
[01:57:45] anyways
[01:57:47] um I don't know what this is gonna be
[01:57:48] but let's see
[01:57:50] what the [ __ ] is this
[01:57:53] can I group them
[01:57:55] dirt is looking at me they're just
[01:57:57] sitting there menacingly man

[01:58:15] to remind
[01:58:17] me okay so we're not gonna die okay
[01:58:19] Lenny for the record Lily's one of the
[01:58:21] squishiest characters uh H man defense
[01:58:23] total lies
[01:58:29] coming out again
[01:58:32] can these [ __ ] die yes or no
[01:58:44] wait there's
[01:58:47] Dale Bennett puzzle
[01:58:56] you want to focus her

[01:59:56] getting me this time
[02:00:04] uh this rotation is kind of cursed but
[02:00:07] let me just heal one tick on kuki so I'm
[02:00:09] not like in range of die
[02:00:11] usually I don't care but people are
[02:00:13] betting their Channel points on this
[02:00:19] the official needs like one more point
[02:00:22] of er there I have to wait
[02:00:23] yeah it was weird
[02:00:31] okay I don't want to start 12-3 with a
[02:00:35] low aged penis so we're gonna heal a
[02:00:37] little we're gonna heal a little one
[02:00:39] more take on cookie one more take on uh
[02:00:42] then we do this
[02:00:47] go

[02:00:52] what the second half is but we'll be
[02:00:54] fine
[02:00:55] yeah I still don't remember
[02:01:02] Puzzle first
[02:01:04] Dash swap
[02:01:06] one more charge
[02:01:13] this guy should die here are you [ __ ]
[02:01:16] getting dude
[02:01:19] what a [ __ ] loser okay we're gonna
[02:01:22] whatever
[02:01:28] it's fine we're doing this because now
[02:01:30] the new enemies are gonna spawn here we
[02:01:32] swirl them with this pyro swap the
[02:01:33] linear Showtime that's why we've been
[02:01:35] about to there wait that guy's a
[02:01:37] geoshield
[02:01:38] we have a claimer no Dodge no Dodge oh
[02:01:41] my God that would have [ __ ] killed me
[02:01:43] I've seen that one shot me in Overworld
[02:01:44] no no no
[02:01:46] I dodged it
[02:01:52] oh I did not mean to swap trust four by
[02:01:55] accident
[02:02:03] yeah we have time I want to get my
[02:02:05] energy back now
[02:02:09] we are not at risk of dying
[02:02:13] let's kill this one
[02:02:15] and then uh well I won't have causes
[02:02:18] burst but it's fine
[02:02:25] that guy turns into a [ __ ] tree what
[02:02:28] the hell
[02:02:29] what the hell you're so chill now yeah
[02:02:31] cause we're uh too cool We're Not Gonna
[02:02:34] Die
[02:02:36] the only thing is
[02:02:38] I don't really know these new enemy
[02:02:39] mechanics and there's a lot of people's
[02:02:41] Channel points on me so I have to be
[02:02:42] extra safe and I'm afraid but I think
[02:02:44] we'll be fine I'm gonna make sure my
[02:02:46] cookie heals one tick before swapping
[02:02:48] out of her
[02:02:49] foreign
[02:03:18] cookie
[02:03:21] all right do this boom boom I don't want
[02:03:25] to use my e here because she's about to
[02:03:27] die yes
[02:03:34] I have to reuse my cookies
[02:03:38] all right now they're dead
[02:03:45] I got fruit
[02:03:53] all right 12 three second off that's
[02:03:56] gonna be easy keep in mind Lenny is very
[02:03:58] squishy and I don't know the Sandy's
[02:03:59] mechanics and I also don't have a shield
[02:04:00] because I'm running there but I think
[02:04:02] we'll be fine
[02:04:04] let me make sure to heal instantly so
[02:04:06] what I'm going to do is instantly heal
[02:04:07] I'm going to do Bennett swap the day I
[02:04:09] gotta heal it take a healing on her swap
[02:04:11] the Kaza swirl swap to Lenny get a
[02:04:13] ticket healing on him and now we're good
[02:04:15] it's showtime
[02:04:17] it's showtime we can break that
[02:04:22] yep they are useful
[02:04:26] don't die
[02:04:28] there's our tank there's our tank
[02:04:30] wait are there slow HP never mind she's
[02:04:33] not thinking anything she's tanking her
[02:04:35] [ __ ] DPS that's what she's doing all
[02:04:37] good at least she's pretty at least
[02:04:38] she's pretty swirl pyro I don't know if
[02:04:39] he's already swirled but let's just
[02:04:40] throw a pyro again then we swap the mini
[02:04:42] then we swap to Lenny
[02:04:47] I wish I had a [ __ ] Shield
[02:04:49] so I said swap I said it I said it alive
[02:04:59] um chat why is that whole team low HP
[02:05:07] all swaps the video I can feel during
[02:05:09] animation
[02:05:11] I did not press four okay well five
[02:05:15] fingered it
[02:05:16] oh my God the damage do you see that
[02:05:19] damage did you see it be honest be
[02:05:21] honest with me be honest with me
[02:05:25] I think we need a shield in this team
[02:05:27] though Dale doesn't cut it against these
[02:05:28] guys so we take so much damage
[02:05:31] man she's doing fine I like there but
[02:05:34] it's easy
[02:05:36] look at this look at this sheesh
[02:05:39] wait that's it
[02:05:41] that could have tasted better
[02:05:43] that was missing a bit of pepper a
[02:05:45] little bit of seasoning
[02:05:49] okay now we do it again with four star
[02:05:51] teams
[02:05:53] that was easy
[02:05:54] imagine being a doubter

[02:09:42] can save our luck for another piece

[02:12:50] that piece is that
[02:12:52] that is probably not going to be the
[02:12:54] last clip of my
[02:12:56] 7 000 resin on this domain video which
[02:12:59] means that
[02:13:01] okay okay now I need to use clips from
[02:13:04] this stream too is my point I don't want
[02:13:08] the [ __ ]
[02:13:10] wait what
[02:13:13] um
[02:13:15] I mean it's dendro but uh
[02:13:19] and I'll take it I guess
[02:13:24] two flat shots yeah but we're not gonna
[02:13:26] roll them
[02:13:27] We're Not Gonna Roll them We're Not
[02:13:29] Gonna Roll them
[02:13:37] it doesn't matter as long as we avoid
[02:13:40] them
[02:13:41] wait a second wait a [ __ ] second wait
[02:13:44] wait everyone wait everyone wait
[02:13:48] everyone wait
[02:13:55] everybody in the classroom pay attention
[02:14:01] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[02:14:04] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[02:14:06] everyone wait everyone wait everyone
[02:14:08] wait
[02:14:09] everyone wait
[02:14:13] everybody in the classroom right now
[02:14:15] wait everyone wait I don't have
[02:14:19] I it's fine I can unlock something I
[02:14:52] finally make sure the instructor's not
[02:14:54] good
[02:14:54] oh that actually
[02:14:58] I'm Gonna Keep it I don't care oh this
[02:15:00] one no okay
[02:15:03] wait I literally I'll put a five star or
[02:15:05] whatever
[02:15:06] well I still can't
[02:15:09] what I have
[02:15:16] okay we're not gonna use this dude I
[02:15:19] actually can't why did I have this

[02:15:36] offset piece it's still good I don't
[02:15:38] know
[02:15:40] who the [ __ ] would use this
[02:15:45] but it's an offset piece
[02:15:47] it's an offset piece
[02:15:51] maybe if they release a character that
[02:15:53] infuses you with dentro Shao could use
[02:15:55] this dendro Xiao because he consumes HP
[02:15:57] dendro Xiao
[02:16:00] yeah you play burning yeah a virgin Al
[02:16:04] Haytham
[02:16:05] true
[02:16:09] true any burning character
[02:16:18] it's actually not bad I still think the
[02:16:20] last piece we got though should be the
[02:16:21] last clip of the video the [ __ ]
[02:16:22] flower
[02:16:23] this is really good
[02:16:27] wait so we have a good marriage but we
[02:16:29] don't have a good [ __ ] um

[02:16:33] we don't have a good Golden Corral for
[02:16:36] official which is what I really need
[02:16:37] we'll go back there in a minute let's do
[02:16:39] a bit more abyss and we'll go back
[02:16:45] maybe the French music blessed us or is
[02:16:48] that what caused us to roll flat
[02:16:49] actually because it might have came on
[02:16:51] late
[02:16:55] let's see French music buffer no
[02:16:59] dude we have four four six six five six
[02:17:01] six
[02:17:06] wait a second what the [ __ ]
[02:17:10] I mean No One's Gonna oh wait I can
[02:17:12] actually use this on farzan as far as on
[02:17:13] to C6 can actually use this like it's
[02:17:15] kind of a meme build but with Xiao it
[02:17:17] could work because we don't need millith
[02:17:18] if we have it on
[02:17:20] like John Lee or something like they are
[02:17:30] okay chat
[02:17:32] I need to throw a piece we we actually
[02:17:34] need to throw one I can't have this many
[02:17:35] plus one am I ever gonna use this be
[02:17:37] [ __ ] for real Am I Ever Gonna use
[02:17:39] this
[02:17:43] actually I might because my Eula is on
[02:17:45] two piece two piece
[02:17:47] no I'm not gonna use it
[02:17:50] it's a waste of XP though but
[02:18:00] okay well this game is
[02:18:04] oh well I mean it was fun have fun with
[02:18:07] this game I have this yo I didn't even
[02:18:10] know nymph's dream was a set why do I
[02:18:12] have these I didn't when did I get these
[02:18:15] what the [ __ ] is this
[02:18:18] I could use the two piece on child
[02:18:19] unironically I could do like two this
[02:18:21] like this and this boom good child two
[02:18:23] piece
[02:18:25] there you go I'll give those a child
[02:18:33] Abyss rewards them out oh yeah honestly
[02:18:35] yeah probably the best words
[02:18:37] how do you calculate crit value it's
[02:18:38] crit damage Plus credit rate times two
[02:18:41] like whatever Critter it is you times do
[02:18:42] it
[02:18:45] so let's say there's a piece that's like
[02:18:46] actually you know what let's Flex my
[02:18:53] man yeah yeah yeah
[02:19:02] so once you have a beautiful piece like
[02:19:04] that right
[02:19:05] it is 29.5 plus 10.9 times 2 which is
[02:19:10] 21.8
[02:19:15] and that's like 51.3 or something
[02:19:18] because I know this piece
[02:19:21] same one sense
[02:19:23] I mean things are right
[02:19:34] oh and the six months I appreciate it
[02:19:38] down
[02:19:40] thank you let's go
[02:19:44] okay let's do more Abyss let's do our
[02:19:46] best the zoom orbis morvis
[02:19:49] more best more best more best more best
[02:19:50] more best more best morbus what does
[02:19:52] that mean it's just to see how it
[02:19:53] doesn't matter I just crit value means
[02:19:56] one crit rate is
[02:19:58] equal damage basically
[02:20:00] a few content creators and I are having
[02:20:03] again
[02:20:04] your community are invited to join kqm

[02:20:41] okay I can't lie I don't even know what
[02:20:43] the I every time I sat down to do
[02:20:45] something I end up not doing it so I'm
[02:20:47] not gonna bait you I'm not even like
[02:20:49] yeah that sounds cool and then never do
[02:20:50] it so
[02:20:51] um
[02:20:53] because I am listen I've said I was
[02:20:56] gonna stream Elden ring for like a year
[02:20:59] now I'm gonna do it I just
[02:21:09] but I can see what it is
[02:21:15] I don't want a minus 200 you know thanks
[02:21:18] to 200.
[02:21:19] and I am a big fan of kitchen Mains they
[02:21:21] are very POG huruki these are nine
[02:21:23] months
[02:21:24] I do like kqm
[02:21:27] how was it this by the way I just missed
[02:21:29] it well you're in luck we're about to
[02:21:30] force dark clear it
[02:21:33] um personally if I were to pick a
[02:21:35] four-star iteration of characters to use
[02:21:38] here
[02:21:40] ah it seems we're gonna have to dust off
[02:21:42] the shangling yep yep you already know
[02:21:44] I'm sorry I'm sorry it's always [ __ ]
[02:21:47] Chang Ling but it is what it is it seems
[02:21:49] like we're gonna have to bring out the
[02:21:50] [ __ ] oppa shangling open this open
[02:21:53] that
[02:21:54] we're gonna have to [ __ ] shangling
[02:21:57] uh I think we're gonna do
[02:21:59] Bennett shangling
[02:22:02] Kaya Rosaria that's not Rosario
[02:22:08] and first half we're gonna play sucrose
[02:22:11] official Zing QE
[02:22:14] singtroll and
[02:22:17] Flex usually it's Beto in this uh Abyss
[02:22:20] it's single Target single Target here
[02:22:21] Beto's good but for these two not really
[02:22:23] so could still use her
[02:22:27] um alternatively we choose dendro but
[02:22:30] then we don't really have someone hyper
[02:22:31] blooming unless we go I mean we could
[02:22:33] still go yow
[02:22:34] but no one's gonna be hyped oh no
[02:22:36] sucrose can we can just swirl the
[02:22:37] electro yeah yeah we can do this yep
[02:22:39] let's do this
[02:22:42] yeah yeah
[02:22:44] okay let me make sure everyone's geared
[02:22:46] they should be but I think my Kaya isn't
[02:22:49] everyone else should be
[02:22:53] don't type gearing we're literally not
[02:22:55] gearing like okay we arguing but we're
[02:22:57] basically done so shut the frick up yeah
[02:23:00] I said Frick because I'm angry yeah
[02:23:02] frick
[02:23:04] okay
[02:23:06] uh we're gonna use black left on them no
[02:23:08] but synchros on Blacklist we're gonna
[02:23:09] use
[02:23:18] we could use fav and then give them a
[02:23:22] crit damage
[02:23:24] Circle it oh that's way too much ER
[02:23:27] though
[02:23:28] he gets ER Ascension also
[02:23:30] uh maybe iron sting
[02:23:44] but it's not five so yeah I know I know
[02:23:46] we'll get there Ali flash I don't have
[02:23:48] it leveled
[02:23:49] wait what about [ __ ]
[02:23:52] wait what about this weapon
[02:23:56] Zappos is actually probably good here
[02:23:59] because em for reverse melt and then we
[02:24:01] give energy
[02:24:05] I actually like zyphos
[02:24:08] yeah I like that first
[02:24:27] actually this is so low this thing is
[02:24:29] probably [ __ ] better
[02:24:30] yeah I was disgusting
[02:24:33] and then my cookie has to be good still
[02:24:34] all right what's our ratio 73 112. yikes
[02:24:38] why is the ratio so bad oh I'm not
[02:24:39] [ __ ] leftover pieces
[02:24:41] that's why
[02:24:42] you run down the [ __ ] of Jeff pieces
[02:24:47] ew oh it's a lot better that's a lot
[02:24:50] better
[02:24:53] um Rosary okay so shangling she's on the
[02:24:56] catch Ben fishing most uh live for the
[02:24:58] boom then bet it uh should be fine we
[02:25:01] just have to give him the sap wood blade
[02:25:04] so he's on a four-star weapon boom boom
[02:25:07] boom and artifacts foreign
[02:25:10] a [ __ ] on ER that's all that really
[02:25:12] matters
[02:25:13] I agree Bennett so true and then Rosaria
[02:25:16] she is on a death match I'm also down to
[02:25:18] give her five Lance
[02:25:21] um but she's on Deathmatch for now
[02:25:23] kind of low ER I can't lie
[02:25:26] so we might want a little bit more
[02:25:29] um
[02:25:31] we got 15 from this boom
[02:25:35] there you go
[02:25:37] and then our first team is Fishel boom
[02:25:41] sucrose
[02:25:45] boom
[02:25:52] xq boom
[02:25:56] and
[02:25:57] Yao squared
[02:26:06] do I even need a leveled weapon uh the
[02:26:08] ER is nice I guess doesn't really matter
[02:26:09] though
[02:26:16] that's our team
[02:26:26] let's go I hacking love no artifact
[02:26:28] presets yes let's go
[02:26:35] oh yeah we are our instructor build is
[02:26:37] for Quicken
[02:26:39] and we are going to be procking
[02:26:41] hyperbloom too
[02:26:42] yeah
[02:26:44] yeah we should probably give her deep
[02:26:46] wood in that team we could also just
[02:26:48] play Kirara and then not need a Healer
[02:26:50] and just go Shields I don't have to gear
[02:26:51] someone else
[02:26:56] but that's less than drop
[02:26:59] yeah we'll just do y'all
[02:27:07] go meow but it's
[02:27:10] enough gearing okay we'll play Kirara
[02:27:12] man fine but the dendro's gonna be less
[02:27:32] fine I'll play kiraro let's give her a
[02:27:35] five or something
[02:27:38] yeah it's also bad yeah but you can on
[02:27:40] field her a bit like well I could go on
[02:27:42] her and then like alt and then like
[02:27:44] and then swap
[02:27:46] all good
[02:27:50] we could also probably just play Quicken
[02:27:51] but we need Hydro okay sucrose
[02:27:56] no we'll start with Kirara
[02:27:59] Kirara
[02:28:01] official
[02:28:08] sucrose
[02:28:13] 1618 is wait who's first in this team
[02:28:15] Rosaria right Rosaria why does it take
[02:28:17] me so long to find characters Rosaria
[02:28:19] Kaya shangling Bennett boom these are
[02:28:22] our teams ready
[02:28:29] foreign
[02:28:33] months
[02:28:39] we could try another one if you want 29.
[02:28:45] why do you say minus 29.
[02:28:51] I'm like panicking what the [ __ ] do I
[02:28:53] want to do okay I'll do this then we'll
[02:28:55] do this as soon as he wakes up
[02:29:00] a [ __ ] excessive anxiety
[02:29:06] we're gonna Dodge this because I'm a
[02:29:07] [ __ ] god gamer boom

[02:29:20] shut the [ __ ] up we're not gonna use her
[02:29:22] burst her burst gives you more dendro
[02:29:24] okay this seems supposed to have another
[02:29:25] dendro like you know he does all better
[02:29:26] but it doesn't matter reverse gives you
[02:29:28] some but I don't want to use that at the
[02:29:29] start because it starts really easy does
[02:29:30] that make sense that makes sense okay
[02:29:37] I'm gonna do this for energy and then
[02:29:40] we'll do this
[02:29:45] I just swirled
[02:29:48] that's fine all right attack swirl
[02:29:52] I'll just watch

[02:39:42] attack for a lot of electric characters
[02:39:43] because
[02:39:46] they do a lot of Electro app but most of
[02:39:48] their hits aren't that big damage
[02:39:50] so so you're aggravating a lot so yeah
[02:39:53] will be about as good as attack also
[02:39:55] some some characters give you bonuses
[02:39:56] with the m like yeah
[02:39:59] Beto her hits are [ __ ] strong she's a
[02:40:01] claymore look at her I mean hey if she
[02:40:04] hits you you feel it so you're not
[02:40:06] you're mostly damaged actually comes
[02:40:08] from her scalings on her burst so attack
[02:40:10] is a bit better than well a decent
[02:40:12] amount better like quite a lot then yeah
[02:40:13] even though yam's fine like it's an okay
[02:40:15] sub stat but it's not like a good enough
[02:40:16] main stat with official it's like
[02:40:18] attacker yeah fine with ya it's like now
[02:40:20] Em's a bit better but they're still
[02:40:22] about as good like yeah it's a bit
[02:40:24] better because they were passive and
[02:40:25] like on field you might quickly like you
[02:40:27] might proc a few hyperlooms depending on
[02:40:29] your team you might just like Quicken
[02:40:30] but like
[02:40:31] but like they're still pretty similar
[02:40:32] and then Beto's just you want to attack
[02:40:38] okay for the person begging for the 11-1
[02:40:40] clear we can do eleven one
[02:40:43] um we're definitely playing sucrose
[02:40:46] and then
[02:40:59] tired ninja those are two months
[02:41:06] x heart
[02:41:12] but I don't think he's geared so that's
[02:41:14] not happening
[02:41:21] we'll do shangling we'll do Bennett
[02:41:24] first half we'll do
[02:41:26] um
[02:41:30] Syncro
[02:41:36] could also DPS Barbara
[02:41:55] foreign
[02:42:01] I can't clear I have her on C1 okay
[02:42:10] I mean honestly [ __ ] it
[02:42:20] foreign
[02:42:29] or another Hydra that's not Barbara but
[02:42:36] we can try this my barber's not cured
[02:42:38] though I mean I could also just play
[02:42:54] no I mean I think shangling solo carries
[02:42:57] this whole thing I don't think we need
[02:42:58] anyone else
[02:43:00] so
[02:43:05] all right for the person who wanted to
[02:43:07] see uh Eula clear I like we got it
[02:43:12] foreign
[02:43:27] oh I need to read summon Oz I mean I
[02:43:29] need to recall him over here forgot
[02:43:52] yoru no gangan
[02:43:56] dude what is
[02:43:59] another way
[02:44:11] missing you look again play thanks
[02:44:16] I probably shouldn't pirate there
[02:44:30] sorry
[02:44:36] foreign
[02:45:03] Ty help a lot
[02:45:06] well I mean we still got it but yeah
[02:45:09] also our second half was so our second
[02:45:11] half was two characters it was just
[02:45:12] shangling Bennett the other two didn't
[02:45:13] really matter and then because it's not
[02:45:15] like we can swirl pyro against those
[02:45:16] guys and then
[02:45:18] um well Lenny's that's like box can but
[02:45:20] other than yeah and then the first
[02:45:24] first half was just three characters it
[02:45:25] was sucrose official Syncro
[02:45:30] well that taunts yeah well she's free
[02:45:32] it's like user but yeah the nice song is
[02:45:34] actually not bad there
[02:45:35] that's true
[02:45:42] yeah you can Global swirl
[02:45:45] but like
[02:45:47] yeah I mean there's no downside you can
[02:45:49] I was just using sucrose first half but
[02:45:51] you definitely can
[02:45:52] there you go
[02:45:54] all right let's do another 12 and then
[02:45:56] we'll go farm artifacts agree agree
[02:45:58] posture check

[02:46:18] I want to clear where official gets to
[02:46:20] be at the Forefront
[02:46:22] can I play aggravated uh second half
[02:46:25] there's cryo Shields though but
[02:46:27] Electro's usually fine against it I just
[02:46:29] don't know about compellius I haven't
[02:46:30] tried a lecture against capellias should
[02:46:31] be fine right

[02:46:50] like you can play like a bit of quick
[02:46:52] bloom
[02:46:53] it's not that bad but we'll try it it
[02:46:56] should be fine
[02:47:07] foreign

[02:48:19] we need it
[02:48:27] well it's not good for crab I mean Xiao
[02:48:30] could probably just Brute Force the
[02:48:31] [ __ ] crab we don't need that much
[02:48:33] Hydro
[02:48:35] how does the crowd's Pyro Shield work
[02:48:38] we can figure it out

[03:00:41] oh I don't need to yell out here

[03:00:48] I can save Yaya's old for when we get it
[03:01:00] my Super's about to die I know using
[03:01:02] dendro on a crowd Shield is very stupid
[03:01:04] but my sucrose is about to die so we
[03:01:07] have to do it like this this
[03:01:13] you again
[03:01:47] cool
[03:01:48] not bad
[03:01:51] easy peasy that was a lot of damage
[03:01:53] pretty good team pretty good clear
[03:01:55] pretty good clear
[03:02:01] uh let me save that clip as a pretty
[03:02:05] decent for
[03:02:16] um
[03:02:20] yeah my kitchen needs more yum but it's
[03:02:23] all good
[03:02:25] um
[03:02:25] I might do if I want to do it actual
[03:02:28] like Fishel
[03:02:29] showcase I might do a team just in
[03:02:31] sucrose Yeah Yeah official and then no
[03:02:32] one else because she could probably
[03:02:34] could probably clear that maybe like
[03:02:35] maybe yaimika or something but
[03:02:37] all right let's go okay shut up we're
[03:02:40] gonna go and cap this resin I agree it's
[03:02:42] actually so fun it is especially with
[03:02:43] thundering Fury catching I think well I
[03:02:45] agree in general is cool but I think
[03:02:46] thundering theory is like so fun because
[03:02:48] you get to spam your eat
[03:02:50] and then your kitchen gets to just
[03:02:52] Cushing all over them
[03:02:55] okay I need to play in English I
[03:02:56] actually forget her voice lines
[03:03:04] what
[03:03:06] foreign
[03:03:21] we spent a lot of artifacts over a
[03:03:24] thousand in the Vermillion strong box
[03:03:25] that's gonna be made into video it's
[03:03:26] almost done
[03:03:29] we're gonna do that again we have a lot
[03:03:31] of five star artifacts we're gonna spend
[03:03:32] these in the strong box again soon once
[03:03:34] the first video is ready we'll do
[03:03:35] another one either emblem or Vermillion
[03:03:37] and then we can make another uh content
[03:03:38] on that
[03:03:57] thank you
[03:04:09] oh I'm sorry
[03:04:20] all right we're good
[03:04:23] um
[03:04:29] all right
[03:04:35] well someone asked me if I have a
[03:04:36] brothers or sisters in French I have one
[03:04:37] brother
[03:04:48] please live action uh I'm I we watched a
[03:04:51] few episodes me fangin's address
[03:04:54] well one but then I watched but yeah
[03:04:56] it's so far it's good but I haven't
[03:04:57] watched this
[03:05:01] it was quite fog
[03:05:19] so not as bad as I thought it would be I
[03:05:21] mean it's not as good as the live-action
[03:05:22] Death Note but you know I mean not
[03:05:25] everything can be a masterpiece like
[03:05:27] that so it is what it is
[03:05:37] which bypass weapons are good to get in
[03:05:39] your opinion if you would listen when I
[03:05:41] speak
[03:05:42] uh you can get the wolf Fang it's a
[03:05:44] pretty good sword
[03:05:45] um The Fjord the pole arm could be good
[03:05:48] if you want em and crit rate a lot of
[03:05:49] characters do no hutau shangling Oppa uh
[03:05:52] the uh Catalyst that gives you crit rate
[03:05:55] HPM could be really good but isn't right
[03:05:57] now so like right now there's no one
[03:05:59] that can really use it but the amount of
[03:06:00] stats you get from it makes it just good
[03:06:02] if someone can use it so probably in the
[03:06:05] future it'll be good and then uh Talking
[03:06:06] Stick is Talking Stick
[03:06:08] and the bow is like okay but it's kind
[03:06:10] of Niche like the Bose stats are fine to
[03:06:12] where it's just fine in general but it's
[03:06:14] mostly for charters
[03:06:18] and it's like pretty like it's mostly
[03:06:20] the effects like single Target right
[03:06:30] and voila
[03:06:37] long stick best one Pella honestly maybe
[03:06:40] Talking Stick is uh is just underrated
[03:06:43] this whole time maybe they release the
[03:06:45] character that's the the talking goat
[03:06:59] is too good though
[03:07:05] foreign
[03:07:18] okay I don't know why I did that
[03:07:26] yeah
[03:07:28] service minus 50 of the time weapon
[03:07:30] without passive [ __ ] it genuinely
[03:07:33] okay you can be exposing your skill
[03:07:36] issue like that first of all some
[03:07:38] characters can snapshot it second of all
[03:07:39] a lot of characters don't even need to
[03:07:41] be on field like Beto you birthed and
[03:07:42] you swap third of all for on-field
[03:07:44] characters first of all the only
[03:07:45] relevant DPS Claymore I'm pretty sure is
[03:07:48] is it just Ito and he has Shields from
[03:07:50] crystallize so you're not gonna take
[03:07:52] damage second of all second of all
[03:07:53] second of all second of all second of
[03:07:56] all second of all even if you don't have
[03:07:58] full Stacks it's still really good like
[03:07:59] even if you're like three stocks but
[03:08:02] that's probably not like you should be
[03:08:03] fine just Dodge or use a shield or just
[03:08:07] I mean even just like the crit rate you
[03:08:09] get like obviously if you just have no
[03:08:10] effect it's not great but like the bass
[03:08:12] is still decent and then dude like the
[03:08:15] stacks are so good man
[03:08:17] foreign
[03:08:30] doesn't really work with everyone's fine
[03:08:32] but yeah uh you stack it to five before
[03:08:34] you started this it's annoying I [ __ ]
[03:08:36] hate that that's the thing I hate the
[03:08:37] most about that weapon is that you have
[03:08:39] to wait like 65 million seconds before
[03:08:42] starting Abyss
[03:08:53] step right up
[03:08:57] I [ __ ] your name up I am so sorry but

[03:11:42] what the hell yeah
[03:11:45] complicated monster lore oh is that why
[03:11:47] there's a lithic pole arm because
[03:11:49] they're like man [ __ ] you monstat
[03:12:01] I know the thrill I know the lore of
[03:12:03] thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers it's
[03:12:04] there's like five Adventures that go out
[03:12:06] actually one second
[03:12:09] you guys don't know turn until the
[03:12:11] dragon Center Laura listen listen listen
[03:12:12] five bands five Heroes embarked on a
[03:12:15] journey to slay the evil dragon for
[03:12:17] honor the master swordsman for research
[03:12:19] the knowledgeable sorceress for Bounty
[03:12:21] the swashbuckling mercenary for
[03:12:24] vengeance the Dead Eye Marksman for
[03:12:27] stories the grand novelist a Lotus
[03:12:29] proceeds from my mouth and flowers bloom
[03:12:32] on the page my words wise and clear and
[03:12:35] my thoughts sharp like lightning I
[03:12:38] joined this party because I couldn't
[03:12:39] find a job and anybody can be a
[03:12:42] copywriter
[03:12:43] but I'm no writer just a regular fellow
[03:12:46] in his mid-20s without an honest job
[03:12:50] wait that's literally me
[03:12:52] wait what the [ __ ]
[03:12:57] does it say that on the weapon or is it
[03:12:59] in the archive oh no wait it might be in
[03:13:01] the lock off a fictional story of a band
[03:13:03] of five Heroes who go off on a Dragon
[03:13:05] Hunt
[03:13:08] them they failed
[03:13:11] Sarge
[03:13:18] I have never read these descriptions
[03:13:26] can you give
[03:13:30] gifts between Yellen and zinqui don't
[03:13:32] plan on pulling for her I explained that
[03:13:34] in my videos of yolan and Synchro but
[03:13:36] especially Elan you can watch that if
[03:13:38] you want basically
[03:13:40] uh Synchro more Hydro app especially at
[03:13:43] C6 but even just Baseline yolan can be a
[03:13:45] bit more
[03:13:47] um can get more at C2 but overall
[03:13:49] they're like they're the same [ __ ] like
[03:13:51] they're both good just use them together
[03:13:53] Yolanda's a bit more team damage like
[03:13:55] okay not true because tinctro has a lot
[03:13:57] of personal damage but Elon and can be
[03:13:59] better especially at C6 but uh Elan can
[03:14:01] give you more because she has this she
[03:14:04] can give your on-field character
[03:14:07] more damage they're just both good and
[03:14:09] also she has well that doesn't matter
[03:14:11] but yeah
[03:14:12] they're both good singtra is a bit the
[03:14:14] only difference you need to care about
[03:14:15] is synchro's a bit more High drop
[03:14:19] uh but you oftentimes want to run them
[03:14:21] together
[03:14:32] the one's more offensive and six was
[03:14:34] more defensive that's not entirely true
[03:14:35] though like okay yes singjo also has
[03:14:37] defensive utility like the rain sorts
[03:14:40] that like damage resist and the heel
[03:14:42] which is cool
[03:14:44] but uh he also has more High drop and
[03:14:46] can have I'm pretty sure C6 can actually
[03:14:48] like okay which one has more damage like
[03:14:51] fluctuates because there's also like
[03:14:53] this depending on your character and
[03:14:55] like you might have elegy whatever the
[03:14:56] [ __ ] but like Synchro also does give you
[03:14:59] more hydro which can give you more
[03:15:00] damage so like if you're only gonna run
[03:15:01] one with hutau you go like you're
[03:15:05] usually like you'd run both
[03:15:06] you might as well
[03:15:08] seeing Joe does have a defensive utility
[03:15:10] which is nice though
[03:15:11] with aqua as long as way more damage
[03:15:13] yeah but why the [ __ ] are you pulling
[03:15:14] Aqua for your lawn
[03:15:19] yeah my Elan also has more damage than
[03:15:21] my sack sword Singh Cho when I'm
[03:15:23] griefing and giving her a crit weapon
[03:15:25] instead of going elegy or fav like a
[03:15:27] true champion
[03:15:34] now disappear
[03:15:37] Ed
[03:15:44] but the Magic Begins
[03:15:50] that is respectable I respect that
[03:15:53] understandable
[03:16:03] I have one 50 ER with artifacts wait
[03:16:07] okay surely you mean like 150 plus your
[03:16:11] hundred right because there's there's no
[03:16:13] way you okay there do you want to see
[03:16:16] what a 150 ER does I'm not even gonna
[03:16:19] 150 okay you know what this is bait
[03:16:44] first the ones at a region
[03:17:00] okay
[03:17:01] I don't need five of one sixty percent
[03:17:03] ER at ziox true
[03:17:06] wait how much air does my a lot have
[03:17:08] right now I wonder if I have a low
[03:17:10] amount
[03:17:11] uh I don't have her in any team
[03:17:16] it's time to pull the trigger 233
[03:17:37] so I actually think it'd be worth the
[03:17:38] pull for xiao's weapons are free to play
[03:17:39] what do you mean like Jade spear
[03:17:43] okay Xiao does get a pretty decent
[03:17:46] DPS increase
[03:17:52] um
[03:17:53] from a five-star weapon
[03:17:55] but if you're gonna pull for a five-star
[03:17:57] weapon you probably don't want the one
[03:17:58] that's on standard Banner unless it's
[03:18:00] like like I would rather go for Homa is
[03:18:03] what I'm saying uh but I like it depends
[03:18:06] like if it's like let's say Xiao comes
[03:18:07] with like
[03:18:09] like it's like Jade spear Jade cutter
[03:18:11] then like that's probably worth it yeah
[03:18:14] but it's like you might just get one
[03:18:16] from standard
[03:18:19] I did not mean to do that whatever
[03:18:47] step right up win stretch
[03:18:53] is 150 ER if you're enough if you're
[03:18:55] interesting show
[03:18:58] uh I mean no like okay
[03:19:02] I don't like answering those questions
[03:19:04] because then someone's gonna be like
[03:19:05] well actually I'm running fav and saxing
[03:19:08] Cho and yeah it is but like
[03:19:11] just use the [ __ ] ER calculator if
[03:19:13] you really care yes it is
[03:19:15] okay we'll see if I'm wrong
[03:19:34] Benny's Adventure team Assemble
[03:19:43] or not
[03:19:46] there you go you're welcome if you're
[03:19:48] not running fav oh wait you always this
[03:19:50] one always has fav second hydro and fav
[03:19:53] it's either 191 if you skill once 150
[03:19:55] skill twice so it depends if you're
[03:19:56] quick swapping or not but also this is
[03:19:59] assuming Norby's in chat that are
[03:20:00] answering this are running fav which I
[03:20:02] hope you are and if you are
[03:20:04] W let's go
[03:20:05] let's go see what do you mean see this
[03:20:07] is a fabulon
[03:20:08] this is a fav
[03:20:11] this is a fabulon it's not a five
[03:20:13] teammate this is five teammate this is
[03:20:14] five year long you guys are like oh I'm
[03:20:16] running aqua
[03:20:21] so maybe defense travel works for you
[03:20:27] I use slingshot on your lawn oh God that
[03:20:29] video did irreparable damage to the
[03:20:31] community I actually can't I actually
[03:20:34] can't that I mean it's okay it's okay
[03:20:37] slingshot's not even that bad it's just
[03:20:40] actually yes it is because five is free
[03:20:42] it's not a bad stat stick if you don't
[03:20:45] need ER if you have if you're like free
[03:20:46] to play
[03:20:47] Birds but when like do fav is Fab is
[03:20:51] free
[03:20:59] but yeah yolan's also a character were
[03:21:01] like
[03:21:01] if I'm being honest like hurt your
[03:21:03] requirements vary a lot because like you
[03:21:04] might have seen trouble you might have
[03:21:06] Ryden you might have neither you might
[03:21:08] have a Fab user you might have yilon on
[03:21:09] fav you might have like sincho on sack
[03:21:12] so like
[03:21:13] yeah it varies a lot
[03:21:17] it's kind of like how I ran Chao at zero
[03:21:20] ER for like three years of my life two
[03:21:22] years until 4 million I ran 105 ER
[03:21:25] always because it's like yeah most
[03:21:27] people want like 20 30 but like
[03:21:30] I would run like just an email supports
[03:21:32] and I had C1 and [ __ ] so it's fine or
[03:21:34] like five
[03:21:41] I was going your season on solo Hydro 5
[03:21:43] is also good when you double Hydro stop
[03:21:44] that stop this stop this
[03:21:47] five is all good with double Hydro
[03:21:48] because the ER you gain is enough to
[03:21:50] make it to where you can go offensive
[03:21:51] stats and it also helps your team
[03:22:08] surprise
[03:22:19] and voila
[03:22:29] is aqua R1 better than r0 Aqua wait okay
[03:22:33] are you talking about C1 wait what no
[03:22:36] that doesn't make sense your question
[03:22:38] does not make okay okay I'm getting
[03:22:40] baited yo if I wasn't surprised
[03:22:45] why are we even talking with your lawn
[03:22:47] right now
[03:22:50] I guess there's still three more days to
[03:22:52] go on
[03:22:53] probably not C1 with aqua yeah but
[03:22:55] they're asking
[03:22:57] I guess they're asking C1 or Aqua but
[03:23:00] the way it was asked okay yeah I guess
[03:23:01] yeah yeah that's probably what they're
[03:23:03] asking
[03:23:06] honestly neither
[03:23:08] see one of the alarms really nice for
[03:23:09] exploring though I kind of wish I had it
[03:23:11] because you can just like run forever so
[03:23:13] it's pretty cool
[03:23:17] it also can help you got like energy and
[03:23:19] [ __ ]
[03:23:21] one with nature
[03:23:25] but if you're just like like I don't
[03:23:27] know
[03:23:29] Nice Shot shut the [ __ ] up I don't even
[03:23:32] know if I missed but the fact that you
[03:23:33] type Nice Shot means I missed so [ __ ]
[03:23:35] you
[03:23:37] one just shot watch your shot
[03:23:43] okay yo she's she's [ __ ] schmooving
[03:23:45] though you can't blame me
[03:23:54] so I still get with no refinements uh
[03:23:56] yes but it gets a lot better with the
[03:23:58] front well
[03:23:59] okay so sacrificial bow or Not Bow but I
[03:24:02] was thinking more of Sword but I guess
[03:24:03] Bo as well sack weapons are more copium
[03:24:07] without enhanced uh refinements then fav
[03:24:09] but fav still wants for five minutes
[03:24:12] but they're okay without it you just
[03:24:13] need to make sure your criter is high
[03:24:15] and you might have to do like more than
[03:24:16] one attack yelon what's nice about fav
[03:24:19] so what happens with Sac right is you
[03:24:22] might just be like you might just be
[03:24:23] [ __ ] like if you have an R1 sack like
[03:24:26] every 30 seconds you're not doing a 30
[03:24:28] second rotation so you're getting this
[03:24:29] once every two rotations and it's 40
[03:24:31] with fav it's like yeah it's a lot
[03:24:34] better at R5 but it's still only 12
[03:24:37] seconds and then that's like okay every
[03:24:38] rotation or twice not really but yeah
[03:24:42] it's like at least once and then also
[03:24:44] it's like yeah the crit is like a chance
[03:24:45] but you can just hit like three enemies
[03:24:47] like example yolan you can mark three or
[03:24:48] whatever
[03:24:50] um single Target might suck you have to
[03:24:52] do like a normal talk but with sack it's
[03:24:54] like let's say I'm using a sax word
[03:24:55] right let's say there's only one enemy
[03:24:58] like you do this
[03:25:00] and then if it doesn't proc well you're
[03:25:02] [ __ ] but if you have a Fab weapon what
[03:25:04] you can do is like you can just Auto
[03:25:05] attack until you get it if you need to
[03:25:08] obviously you don't want to be doing
[03:25:09] that but like if you have to you have to
[03:25:12] I don't know what happened to this
[03:25:13] domain
[03:25:24] on the r58 I only have R15
[03:25:27] okay this is why okay I think this is
[03:25:30] where I differentiate from the Jeff's no
[03:25:32] weapon Banner rule where I think
[03:25:34] unironically like I get that'll okay it
[03:25:37] might it hurts like in my opinion I get
[03:25:40] that a lot of free to play players want
[03:25:41] a [ __ ] ton of characters like a lot of
[03:25:43] people who play a game like engine you
[03:25:45] want a lot of characters and I do too
[03:25:46] but I also think that like
[03:25:48] if the [ __ ] like if it's like a lot of
[03:25:51] Fab weapons on a banner or like a lot of
[03:25:52] weapons like you could use just to
[03:25:54] better your account
[03:25:56] then it can be worth pulling for like
[03:25:57] example is like let's say you're fine
[03:26:00] with either of these bows because you
[03:26:01] play a bow character that wants a
[03:26:02] five-star weapon but that can use it and
[03:26:04] you're like okay I would love five lands
[03:26:06] I would love like sack sword I would
[03:26:07] love sack whatever it's like it's not it
[03:26:10] would be Primo gem efficient to pull on
[03:26:12] it but it might not be efficient for
[03:26:13] your happiness especially if you're free
[03:26:14] to play because you might be like well
[03:26:16] yeah it's efficient to get fat weapons
[03:26:18] and yeah my Lenny does more damage but
[03:26:20] now I can't get I don't know like I'll
[03:26:22] hide them or now I can't get Elon or now
[03:26:24] I can't like so it might not be like
[03:26:26] yeah it depends
[03:26:28] don't say this to me I'm saving for
[03:26:29] another yet well see for you safer not
[03:26:32] yet if I'm free to play
[03:26:34] I'm not gonna pull on a weapon matter
[03:26:35] unless I can get the characters that I
[03:26:37] want
[03:26:38] but like example is like Xiao gains a
[03:26:40] lot of DPS from a five-star weapon so is
[03:26:42] it worth it to get a five star weapon
[03:26:45] versus a five star support for Xiao in
[03:26:48] particular probably but is it better for
[03:26:51] your account is it better for like hey I
[03:26:53] want to have cool characters maybe not
[03:26:55] so it depends I do think that like if
[03:26:58] you don't have good four stars either
[03:26:59] like you don't have like there's a like
[03:27:01] a string list and five on a banner you
[03:27:03] don't have either then it might be worth
[03:27:08] foreign
[03:27:12] makes sense yeah it's fine that's a
[03:27:15] decent last option
[03:27:16] um also it lets you use harbinger of
[03:27:19] dawn if you want it's not like his best
[03:27:21] weapon but it's a good free to play one
[03:27:22] if you're running strongly
[03:27:33] as long as weapon good on your lawn it's
[03:27:35] it's so wasted on her it's okay it's
[03:27:38] good on literally everyone because it
[03:27:39] has the stats of Staff of homo okay
[03:27:42] so I'm never gonna say no but the
[03:27:44] passive gives you attack which Elon
[03:27:46] can't use
[03:27:48] and charge attack damage which Elon
[03:27:50] can't use well she can like quick scope
[03:27:52] but like yeah
[03:28:00] did you get the crystal fly trap we'll
[03:28:01] get it next stream before the week or so
[03:28:03] that's true
[03:28:06] move and speed true
[03:28:10] uh should I do another [ __ ] it [ __ ] it
[03:28:13] we're gonna commence more
[03:28:16] I need one resin for another condensed
[03:28:19] how long form it
[03:28:36] don't pep it up you me I'm right
[03:28:41] is there a good free to play weapon for
[03:28:42] Lenny oh boy that's actually a good
[03:28:44] question that's actually a good question
[03:28:46] if only let me let me go to xyox's
[03:28:49] lining guide because amazing video I I'm
[03:28:51] sure he will answer that question
[03:28:54] first grade okay cool what about fruit
[03:28:56] of the weapons let's see is there a good
[03:28:58] friend of the option I wonder let's see
[03:28:59] if he mentions it well with Amos okay
[03:29:01] travel time great stats but he also has
[03:29:04] some decent four-star options yeah like
[03:29:05] either of the battle pass ones
[03:29:07] because it doesn't give you as much
[03:29:09] critics sure
[03:29:11] a free display option okay prototype
[03:29:13] question cool you can shoot weak ones
[03:29:15] nice okay um on the weak point of an
[03:29:19] enemy yeah this is usually very easy to
[03:29:20] do but keep in mind that some enemies
[03:29:22] don't have weak points yeah it can vary
[03:29:23] in strength based on the content you're
[03:29:25] doing okay cool assuming you can proc
[03:29:26] this weapons effect though it can be
[03:29:27] even better than the battle pass options
[03:29:29] and one of if not you're cool other
[03:29:31] options include Blacklist yeah any new
[03:29:33] song of Stillness okay being good as
[03:29:35] well wow if only if imagine if there's
[03:29:37] not a weapon ranking too oh my God
[03:29:39] yeah so there you go
[03:29:52] are you guys typing NPC
[03:30:12] while you watch your own video dude
[03:30:14] sometimes I forget okay sometimes I'll
[03:30:16] literally forget things about a
[03:30:17] character and I'll have to watch parts
[03:30:18] of my video I'm not even kidding
[03:30:21] like okay what if I don't play like like
[03:30:23] [ __ ] Albedo for a year and I'm like
[03:30:24] oh let me check this or like what if I
[03:30:26] don't play like
[03:30:27] I built my [ __ ] Lisa I'm like oh let
[03:30:30] me go you know
[03:30:31] I mean usually are like most of the
[03:30:33] things I'm fine for but mostly ER
[03:30:36] amounts ER amounts I forget a lot
[03:30:38] is this like like I know the characters
[03:30:40] that I play and like I know rough ranges
[03:30:42] but like
[03:30:44] yeah or like exact weapon rankings like
[03:30:46] examples like
[03:30:49] zero yeah
[03:30:51] like if you ask me like a random ass
[03:30:53] refinement versus another random ass for
[03:30:55] five minutes like
[03:30:58] dude he just came out okay Lenny I still
[03:31:00] know everything but I'm saying like in
[03:31:01] general
[03:31:04] oh what's up so now this is a month
[03:31:10] hope you and Chad had a wonderful day no
[03:31:12] freak chat
[03:31:31] the sky is fake

[03:33:03] new Banner that is true I mean I'm not
[03:33:05] gonna make the video or anything but I
[03:33:07] haven't even looked at it on stream I
[03:33:08] looked at it all stream I don't remember
[03:33:10] the weapons
[03:33:11] but I remember the characters we can
[03:33:13] look at it give me a second
[03:33:15] thank you
[03:33:19] [ __ ] I didn't even throw up please
[03:33:21] explode please
[03:33:24] oh we got one
[03:33:27] that's right dude where the [ __ ] is the
[03:33:41] Here Comes
[03:33:46] wait what the [ __ ] now disappear
[03:33:59] uh we can pull up the banners uh x.com
[03:34:03] true
[03:34:17] alright so here are the new banners in
[03:34:19] case you didn't see them there is John
[03:34:21] Zhang Lee Child
[03:34:24] and their weapons so uh obviously
[03:34:27] for the five stars you already know
[03:34:29] strongly
[03:34:30] good shielder for Comfort not needed but
[03:34:32] nice
[03:34:33] child
[03:34:36] best character for international
[03:34:39] he has a few windows
[03:34:43] Guru shangling decent Hydro otherwise on
[03:34:46] field
[03:34:47] now the four stars
[03:34:49] dude what the [ __ ] is this
[03:34:52] like actually
[03:34:54] okay we don't know from a yet we'll see
[03:34:57] how good he is or bad or whatever uh he
[03:34:59] does look very four-star but I'm excited
[03:35:01] because he has a mechanical penguin so
[03:35:02] hopefully he's fun or interesting and
[03:35:04] then I'll be happy
[03:35:06] with that in mind the other two
[03:35:07] characters are Noel and say you so I
[03:35:10] know Noel has a dedicated Community but
[03:35:12] to the five dedicated Noel mains you
[03:35:14] probably have her C6 you got her free
[03:35:16] and 1.0 you probably have to see six by
[03:35:18] now so you don't want her again on a
[03:35:19] better
[03:35:20] soon uh and these are Claymore these are
[03:35:23] literally three Claymore characters
[03:35:24] notoriously Claymore characters dude I
[03:35:26] feel like it's not even that there's not
[03:35:28] a lot of Claymore characters it's that
[03:35:29] you end up not using them like I
[03:35:32] actually can't like
[03:35:34] I actually tweeted about this but you
[03:35:36] need like I need like five devonius
[03:35:39] lances I need like five fast swords I
[03:35:41] use a bunch of [ __ ] thrilling tales
[03:35:43] and there's a bunch of five bows the
[03:35:45] only fav Claymore character I use is
[03:35:47] like
[03:35:51] foreign
[03:35:55] and then it's like maybe Ito or yulon
[03:35:58] field and then it's like so yeah I claim
[03:36:00] where they're kind of in a weird spot
[03:36:01] but it's all good
[03:36:03] um sorry is okay Noel is Noel
[03:36:11] um if you are a you know if you're
[03:36:13] someone who loves one of these
[03:36:14] characters you're like man I need Noel I
[03:36:16] need saw you I need feminine then cool
[03:36:18] but outside of that it's like yeah
[03:36:22] uh and then the weapons I didn't
[03:36:23] actually look at the weapon matter but
[03:36:24] how is
[03:36:25] how is this Bane on every Banner dude
[03:36:28] who has a [ __ ] hard on for dragon's
[03:36:30] vein this on every Banner it's literally
[03:36:33] Dragons by dragons me dragons made
[03:36:34] dragons oh far is on canopy on wander
[03:36:36] and shouse banner dragon's Bane dragons
[03:36:41] uh rust is cool for like two characters
[03:36:43] flute is dog [ __ ] sack Greatsword is
[03:36:47] I mean no and then [ __ ] with it is
[03:36:50] great but like
[03:36:52] it's also an old ass weapon Wizard's
[03:36:54] good Wizard's good
[03:36:56] Dragon man is good but it's been on
[03:36:58] Loom banner and then the other three are
[03:37:00] like rust could be good if you're like
[03:37:02] you know you don't have it for like
[03:37:04] yoemy or something but other other than
[03:37:07] that it's like kind of bad and
[03:37:10] the star is amazing
[03:37:11] is a weapon uh of all time it's
[03:37:14] definitely a weapon for sure I think
[03:37:18] um
[03:37:19] so I don't recommend like
[03:37:21] there are bows of similar if you want to
[03:37:24] actually this is the take if you want a
[03:37:25] bow pull now genuinely I don't care for
[03:37:28] who if you want a bow get one of these
[03:37:30] two polar stars on the same level
[03:37:31] sometimes better like poster is great
[03:37:33] but like
[03:37:34] you don't want to miss and get Vortex so
[03:37:37] like just pull for this bow if you want
[03:37:39] a bow and if you're like oh but I have a
[03:37:42] crit damage Circle not a critter one
[03:37:44] okay Farm a [ __ ] crittery one you're
[03:37:46] welcome good advice
[03:37:54] Pulsar is better you have to like
[03:37:57] on some characters and then sometimes it
[03:37:59] isn't even better and then it's like
[03:38:00] when it is it's like a few percents wow
[03:38:03] I would rather guarantee a good bow than
[03:38:06] get
[03:38:07] maybe vortex
[03:38:09] and the four stars compared to these
[03:38:11] like these you get five you get sock
[03:38:19] I do think Polar Star is great like I
[03:38:21] have polar I don't have the others
[03:38:23] so like this is coming from a Polar Star
[03:38:25] enjoyer I have polar I don't have the
[03:38:27] other bows but it's like if you want a
[03:38:30] bow are you really gonna risk getting
[03:38:33] Vortex maybe maybe you want Vortex on
[03:38:35] your [ __ ] Shao on your like shanha
[03:38:37] and you don't want to go fav Maybe
[03:38:43] but yeah
[03:38:46] I don't recommend it
[03:38:50] didn't you get polar and random single
[03:38:52] pull yeah but hey
[03:38:56] it's cracked
[03:38:58] it's just the weapon Banner is like
[03:39:01] every okay let me put it this way
[03:39:02] everything other than Polar Star and
[03:39:05] witsith you probably don't want unless
[03:39:08] you still don't have rust or [ __ ]
[03:39:10] dragons Mane you probably don't want
[03:39:11] anything else on this Banner so I don't
[03:39:13] like it
[03:39:17] didn't calc new damage dealings with R5
[03:39:20] Vortex with new set who gives any
[03:39:23] resemblance of a [ __ ] about R5 vortex
[03:39:27] genuinely
[03:39:29] like what
[03:39:34] I'm being that ass who the [ __ ] cares
[03:39:36] about if you pull R5 Vortex because that
[03:39:38] spreadsheet told you to you are too far
[03:39:40] gone I'm sorry I'm actually like I am
[03:39:43] all for like
[03:39:45] like teasing what's the best DPS and all
[03:39:47] that but there's no way you're pulling
[03:39:49] R5 Vortex for Xiao
[03:39:52] there is unless okay if it's like five
[03:39:54] percent or ten percent no not five if
[03:39:56] it's like 10 better please inform me but
[03:39:59] there is no [ __ ] way
[03:40:01] also
[03:40:04] yeah there's I would have to see that
[03:40:19] yeah it's also ugly with him true it
[03:40:22] feels disrespectful
[03:40:39] oh okay
[03:40:42] okay
[03:40:50] now why do you have it I don't even know
[03:40:52] how I got it
[03:40:54] I don't want that [ __ ] man
[03:40:56] now I use it sometimes but you know
[03:41:03] actually no I don't
[03:41:19] know no luck what's like
[03:41:46] oh it's like I am looking for something
[03:42:12] foreign
[03:42:46] Okay so
[03:42:48] I have to look into this a bit as a
[03:42:50] dedicated chow mein but credit the
[03:42:52] charmains for this but to the people
[03:42:53] being like Oh
[03:42:55] R5 vortex
[03:42:58] according to these like okay listen
[03:43:00] the only listen okay first of all
[03:43:03] for normal players right
[03:43:06] for normal players
[03:43:08] R1 Jade
[03:43:11] on Vermilion is gonna be and okay I know
[03:43:15] zags count different stuff and like a
[03:43:17] bunch of people characters and stuff so
[03:43:18] I'm not gonna assume that these are like
[03:43:19] perfect because I don't know the
[03:43:20] assumptions but
[03:43:22] Vermillion well I know the assumptions
[03:43:24] but I don't know if they got change or
[03:43:26] like I know what the assumptions were
[03:43:27] when they whatever doesn't matter
[03:43:28] Vermillion is like the artifact said
[03:43:32] Vermillion when you look at Jade Versus
[03:43:33] Jade it's better but then when you look
[03:43:35] at Jade versus vortex it's also better
[03:43:37] and then we look at Jade versus vortex
[03:43:38] in Vermilion it's better and then in
[03:43:41] Hunter Vortex is slightly better which
[03:43:43] pog
[03:43:45] but my point is if you're gonna
[03:43:48] how do I say this it's like
[03:43:50] this is also shielded and stacked and if
[03:43:53] you're unstacked or unshield is worse
[03:43:54] and I would argue that Houma or Jade way
[03:43:58] better on your account
[03:44:00] than Vortex but this is also depending
[03:44:02] on your team because this has been in C6
[03:44:04] stars on let's say you don't have
[03:44:04] Bennett then attack is even better right
[03:44:06] probably I didn't look here but I assume
[03:44:08] yeah so Ben is a lot better without
[03:44:09] Bennett versus uh with Bennett
[03:44:13] with that said
[03:44:15] [ __ ] apparently R5 vortex
[03:44:18] gives you uh goes from four there to
[03:44:21] five wow that is uh that is definitely a
[03:44:25] take so
[03:44:26] if you want that very slight not even a
[03:44:29] percent increase from Jade spear to
[03:44:31] Vortex be sure to R5 your Vortex on the
[03:44:34] new set
[03:44:35] I can't wait it's still less than
[03:44:37] [ __ ] Jade and Vermillion
[03:44:40] right still less than Jaden Vermillion
[03:44:42] Jaden Vermillion is 118.
[03:44:45] vortex in uh Hunters 115.
[03:44:48] so imagine r5ing Vortex or being worse
[03:44:50] than Vermillion
[03:44:55] because that statement out of context
[03:44:57] was uh
[03:45:04] hmm
[03:45:07] I guess it depends though
[03:45:08] I mean okay good to know that Vortex is
[03:45:10] well Vortex always been good on Xiao
[03:45:12] it's always been fine it's usually a
[03:45:14] little bit worse than Jaden Homa now
[03:45:16] it's if you have the new set then you
[03:45:17] get a lot of crit from the set so attack
[03:45:19] is naturally better so it's a bit more
[03:45:21] it's like on par which is cool that's a
[03:45:23] good thing that makes a weapon that's
[03:45:24] otherwise okay pretty good for one
[03:45:27] character
[03:45:29] but still everything I said is still
[03:45:31] true I don't really recommend it
[03:45:36] um
[03:45:39] yeah like
[03:45:43] yeah dude if if like so the purple means
[03:45:47] vermilion's better in these calcs if
[03:45:49] Vermilion wasn't better for Jade or Homa
[03:45:52] and I had to farm a new set for Xiao I
[03:45:54] think I would actually like I would
[03:45:56] actually throw up
[03:46:10] Discord so like I'm not gonna I mean I
[03:46:14] could link it but I don't want to like
[03:46:15] yoink their like join their Discord like
[03:46:17] show them support it's discord.g's not
[03:46:19] shallow it should be so you can destroy
[03:46:21] it and then it'll be in
[03:46:24] probably the useful Channel thing you
[03:46:26] could just control F into this card you
[03:46:27] get a search
[03:46:37] did I miss like two Bennett E's bro how
[03:46:40] does that even happen
[03:46:45] I didn't even know that was possible man
[03:46:47] this game [ __ ] auto targets for you
[03:46:59] mad
[03:47:00] things
[03:47:06] PC Library yeah there you go I just
[03:47:08] control f'd but yeah
[03:47:10] foreign
[03:47:22] wait it should be is it not similar with
[03:47:24] Calamity queller I know that's not
[03:47:26] attack percentage base attack but well
[03:47:28] the tiger says a lot lower I mean but
[03:47:30] maybe like a Calamity color oh Calico is
[03:47:32] about the same
[03:47:34] that's the R5 the R1 is actually what
[03:47:36] the [ __ ]
[03:47:39] oh yeah okay that makes sense
[03:47:43] okay
[03:47:45] all right
[03:48:00] is Lynette the best cat girl at Zion I
[03:48:03] thought it was on Xiao I just pressed e
[03:48:05] three times okay
[03:48:07] uh I
[03:48:10] I like Lynette and I like her voice
[03:48:12] lines in Japanese I think they're funny
[03:48:15] um
[03:48:16] however
[03:48:19] I don't know I am
[03:48:22] exuberated at the fact that I can be a
[03:48:25] cat box parcel so I don't know if that's
[03:48:27] disrespectful to say but I am a Kirara
[03:48:29] enjoyer
[03:48:31] I like that I can be a parcel
[03:48:33] a package
[03:48:43] also this is gonna be my worst take like
[03:48:47] people even like I can no longer be as
[03:48:49] awesome after this
[03:48:51] so I'm sorry I know I shouldn't say this
[03:48:53] but
[03:48:55] but
[03:48:56] I went to the Art Exhibit
[03:48:59] in New York and I saw art of characters
[03:49:02] before they came out there's a bunch of
[03:49:03] cool art shout out to hoyo for that
[03:49:05] there's a bunch of cool art
[03:49:08] and it was really sick and I got to see
[03:49:09] Lynette with her hair down listen I get
[03:49:12] that her hair is like this for like
[03:49:13] performance like probably but the art of
[03:49:16] Lynette with her hair down like not
[03:49:17] these disgusting ass whatever okay I'm
[03:49:19] not trying to Flame no disrespect but
[03:49:21] looked way [ __ ] better but I get why
[03:49:24] it's there it's like because they're a
[03:49:25] magician they perform they need to like
[03:49:27] tie their hair up whatever I get it it's
[03:49:28] cool all good in science class they used
[03:49:31] to tell us hey if you have long hair if
[03:49:32] I can tie it up so it doesn't get cut in
[03:49:34] the drill or you burn I know I know but
[03:49:37] just saying having seen official
[03:49:40] pre-release art
[03:49:42] from the hoyo artists of Lynette with
[03:49:44] her hair down I now look at this and I
[03:49:47] get upset
[03:49:49] maybe it would be a skin in the future
[03:49:50] or something I don't know and I know why
[03:49:53] it's there oh they have to for
[03:49:54] performances I get it but now I look at
[03:49:57] it I'm like dude what is this [ __ ]
[03:49:58] budget Elon ass cut and even yolan's cut
[03:50:00] should be
[03:50:02] but I mean I like it I still like her
[03:50:04] like I'm just like
[03:50:06] I do like the the like that's like long
[03:50:08] in the back but it's kind of like wait

[03:50:11] like jebase you like you think she has
[03:50:12] short hair and there's long hair
[03:50:14] it's the debate haircut
[03:50:16] yolan looks good match okay Elon looks
[03:50:19] good but her haircut is dog [ __ ] but she
[03:50:20] makes it look good because she is
[03:50:22] attractive conventionally Attractive
[03:50:24] people can make bad haircuts look good
[03:50:26] true what did I roll if it's a sixth I
[03:50:27] didn't see

[03:53:47] probably do another Abyss clear I don't
[03:53:49] know I don't know how I feel what this
[03:53:50] is It's kind of whatever it's yes
[03:54:05] it's not too bad
[03:54:08] it's a challenging is it boring is it
[03:54:10] too easy well okay it's easy for me but
[03:54:12] I try to like not say it's easy because
[03:54:14] obviously it's gonna be easy for me if I
[03:54:15] have like good ass like artifacts and
[03:54:17] [ __ ] but
[03:54:19] um it's definitely easier than some of
[03:54:21] the other ones uh last one is super easy
[03:54:22] as well I think it's better than last
[03:54:24] Abyss but worse than some of the other
[03:54:26] abysses we've had should I solve off
[03:54:27] linear or just getting myself a funny
[03:54:29] okay
[03:54:34] foreign
[03:54:41] minus one year
[03:54:56] oh yeah this guy's name is Miko Miko
[03:54:58] Miko
[03:55:00] we have to review that yeah
[03:55:07] 11-1 is kind of annoying I do agree for
[03:55:10] floor 12 it's voila I don't think it's
[03:55:13] like hard
[03:55:15] uh the last boss is unforgiving I'm a
[03:55:18] villain but you have like you can run a
[03:55:21] Schiller you could just dodge like you
[03:55:22] could reset if you die but he does he
[03:55:23] does they can like melt you if you like
[03:55:26] Ben at all or they could just do a lot
[03:55:27] of damage you
[03:55:37] I noticed I okay I've noticed that like
[03:55:39] when the abyss is like turbo [ __ ]
[03:55:41] hard and annoying
[03:55:43] We complain and then when it's too easy
[03:55:45] We complain so I'm trying to be like
[03:55:47] like what do I actually want I just want
[03:55:49] to be fun like I just wanted to be like
[03:55:50] interactive although okay unironically
[03:55:55] okay this is a terrible take but I
[03:55:57] enjoyed the [ __ ] getting destroyed
[03:55:59] and rammed against the wall by the
[03:56:01] [ __ ] uh the two the the Croco like
[03:56:03] the the the the the the the the monster
[03:56:05] things what are they called what are
[03:56:07] those things called what are those
[03:56:08] things called what are those things
[03:56:09] called the the [ __ ] consecrated
[03:56:13] beasts
[03:56:14] but it was not fun like I didn't enjoy
[03:56:16] it but I enjoyed like I miss it
[03:56:21] because it was content it was fun to
[03:56:23] stream it was like hard it was enjoyable
[03:56:24] like but I don't think it was like good
[03:56:26] like
[03:56:27] I wouldn't want my friends to have to do
[03:56:30] that I wouldn't want you guys to have to
[03:56:32] do that
[03:56:35] but I enjoyed it more than just like
[03:56:39] easy Abyss
[03:56:45] I do think we need a thing where it's
[03:56:47] like
[03:56:48] how do you think a business needs two
[03:56:49] things I think it needs one uh more of
[03:56:52] like
[03:56:54] more of a balance between like a
[03:56:56] different type of difficulty where it's
[03:56:57] like
[03:56:59] hey like you might have to kill an enemy
[03:57:01] in a specific order or like learn to
[03:57:02] group them and this and that not just
[03:57:04] DPS check not just like hey you're
[03:57:05] getting [ __ ] by five consecrated bees
[03:57:07] have fun
[03:57:08] although I still personally enjoy that
[03:57:10] more than the easiest thing ever but
[03:57:12] that is the bad take but anyways and
[03:57:15] then take two is for [ __ ] like that they
[03:57:17] should make it [ __ ] why don't they
[03:57:19] just make another floor like let's say
[03:57:20] they're gonna be like okay you know what
[03:57:22] consecrated beasts they're annoying it's
[03:57:24] gonna be harder than most other ones
[03:57:25] okay that's 413.
[03:57:29] doesn't have to be like 12. because the
[03:57:32] difference between 12
[03:57:34] patches ago and 12 now
[03:57:37] pretty [ __ ] big difference
[03:57:49] you still watch it the high tide low
[03:57:50] tide to come back
[03:57:52] mechanics like that can be cool but high
[03:57:54] tide low tide forever made me upset
[03:57:56] because it made a ride and seem like a
[03:57:58] bad character like we knew she wasn't
[03:57:59] bad but you couldn't show it off because
[03:58:02] the whole Abyss was like hey here's all
[03:58:04] of your energies then you play right in
[03:58:05] and who the [ __ ] cares about the energy
[03:58:07] you're getting because you already have
[03:58:08] all your energy and it was it was that
[03:58:10] one right it was new
[03:58:22] now disappear
[03:58:30] damn high that low that is two years ago
[03:58:32] yeah actually I mean as when Ryden came
[03:58:34] out
[03:58:36] and ryden's like two point something
[03:58:41] that wasn't fun no I that mechanic
[03:58:43] wasn't great were there any like new
[03:58:44] mechanics in these that were fun
[03:58:46] am I forgetting some
[03:59:03] wow good job team
[03:59:08] all right let's check let's check a
[03:59:10] thousand achievements all right let's
[03:59:12] check Miko Miko Miko's [ __ ] Miko
[03:59:15] let's see this has to be good if this
[03:59:16] isn't good my life is a lie cougar is
[03:59:18] verity that's good c0 but you know
[03:59:20] Triple Crown respectable respectable we
[03:59:22] respect that you don't need to wail to
[03:59:24] be a dedicated Mane two wonders to TF is
[03:59:26] fine it's fine it's okay new set or
[03:59:29] gilded are both pretty cracked for her
[03:59:31] but this is fine let's look at sub stats
[03:59:34] oh
[03:59:35] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:59:38] wait a second wait a second this is
[03:59:41] [ __ ] stupid okay feather pretty good
[03:59:46] sense
[03:59:50] yo okay yeah it says it's better if
[03:59:53] you're like quickening right but this is
[03:59:55] like a co-op Andy so they're probably
[03:59:56] just playing guy in whatever team so
[03:59:57] attack is probably better uh if you're
[03:59:59] not you know procure reactions this
[04:00:01] [ __ ] cracks seriously holy [ __ ] come
[04:00:04] on don't let me down
[04:00:09] [ __ ] you
[04:00:11] sorry that was toxic
[04:00:12] we're not done we're not done we're not
[04:00:14] done we're not done we're not done the
[04:00:15] review we're not done the review we're
[04:00:16] not done to review
[04:00:26] wait you least online
[04:00:29] um
[04:00:35] wait what else so goblet
[04:00:38] it's okay and so it's okay even I'll
[04:00:41] kill these had a heel it's okay
[04:00:45] pretty good like if I had this I would
[04:00:46] use it it's pretty good it's not amazing
[04:00:49] but it's pretty good lastly the circular
[04:00:51] don't let me down that is a good circuit
[04:00:53] a lot of crit damage some attack percent
[04:00:55] pretty decent let's look at the ratio
[04:00:59] yo wait you have zero ER
[04:01:04] this is a pretty cracked eye Miko
[04:01:06] however you only get to use your burst
[04:01:07] once per patch but maybe you play with
[04:01:10] writing or something
[04:01:14] could be an ebot yeah if this is
[04:01:19] if you're a skill bot yeah you just use
[04:01:21] your skill then you want the new set
[04:01:22] it's insane on her option two you use
[04:01:25] your burst
[04:01:26] then
[04:01:27] with this ER you can use it
[04:01:29] approximately once per patch
[04:01:32] right here right now emerge
[04:01:36] check right in also check it out
[04:01:41] and golfing
[04:01:43] emblem c0 Triple Crown as well oh my God
[04:01:46] they're all triple crowned
[04:01:54] oh that's pretty good
[04:01:56] the [ __ ] is actually pretty good
[04:02:00] what the hell
[04:02:05] not accurate call me
[04:02:08] boy this is so based signature weapon
[04:02:10] signature weapon signature weapon
[04:02:12] that is so based
[04:02:16] yeah maybe they're on field the eye and
[04:02:18] then they they're like [ __ ] ER because
[04:02:19] they're they look like a co-oper
[04:02:21] honestly yeah and a co-oper with no ER
[04:02:23] is probably fine
[04:02:26] there's a co-oper [ __ ] it
[04:02:36] Ralph Is Us 26. Bulls
[04:03:13] oh well undertale music still it's hard
[04:03:14] eight years later because undertale's
[04:03:16] goated Toby Fox the goat
[04:03:19] very that game is lit I haven't played
[04:03:22] it yet though but I've watched like a
[04:03:23] lot of it
[04:03:31] but how is that game so old though
[04:03:34] is it actually that old now
[04:03:36] undertale
[04:03:37] holy [ __ ]
[04:03:40] 2015.
[04:03:41] what the [ __ ]
[04:03:43] oh where
[04:03:45] 2015
[04:03:49] how the hell is underdale 2015 oh dude
[04:03:53] it's what eight years now
[04:04:02] oh
[04:04:20] life idiom
[04:04:31] yeah
[04:04:34] hope
[04:04:36] don't worry Chad there will be variety
[04:04:38] no copium
[04:04:57] no copium
[04:05:07] star rail Alden ring Valerian what else
[04:05:09] what else that's three right there
[04:05:10] that's literally three games you have to
[04:05:11] play that's three Starlet doesn't really
[04:05:13] count as variety but [ __ ] you all right
[04:05:15] and we have to play our for your play
[04:05:17] count that counts as variety that counts
[04:05:18] as variety back out I just don't want to
[04:05:20] log into it yet because I probably have
[04:05:21] the like hey welcome back so yeah
[04:05:34] all right
[04:05:37] did you do strong box no I want to say
[04:05:40] strong box for a video but we can do it
[04:05:43] we have five we could do a little bit we
[04:05:45] can just get a taste see if we got a
[04:05:47] good familiar because my next my strong
[04:05:48] last video my next one might be like
[04:05:49] emblem or something so it's okay if we
[04:05:51] do a bit of Vermilion just for fun and
[04:05:53] then we'll save most of it for the next
[04:05:55] time
[04:05:57] true
[04:05:58] good take nightmare taketh all right
[04:06:01] let's take a little bit let's just get a
[04:06:03] little bit of Vermillion let's just see
[04:06:04] let's just see for fun just for fun just
[04:06:06] just just for fun
[04:06:15] we'll do like 24. just for fun
[04:06:18] it's just a little bit boom okay okay
[04:06:21] okay okay okay
[04:06:23] that could be good nope no no no no
[04:06:29] but that one could be good
[04:06:31] got a circle right
[04:06:33] could be good
[04:06:47] that's artifact maybe man you never know
[04:06:49] you never know until you know famous
[04:06:51] thing
[04:06:54] okay
[04:06:56] um this probably isn't worth leveling
[04:06:58] however
[04:07:00] I am stupid and therefore I will level
[04:07:02] it
[04:07:04] laughs
[04:07:06] I mean it's a hotel piece I guess
[04:07:10] well well maybe that's why we stopped
[04:07:13] doing Vermillion what if we do okay
[04:07:15] again we have to save mostly for video
[04:07:16] but what if we do like one or one or two
[04:07:18] emblem like just one
[04:07:21] one nine nine on emblem
[04:07:22] not on emblem emblem what's wrong with
[04:07:25] emblem
[04:07:27] this could be good great
[04:07:33] let's do a little bit more emblem a
[04:07:34] little bit more amble just a little bit
[04:07:35] we'll save the rest
[04:07:37] a little bit more emblem oh [ __ ] we did
[04:07:39] Vermillion oh oops oh
[04:07:50] or there's also Miller lift
[04:08:15] okay we gotta stop we gotta stop we
[04:08:16] gotta stop
[04:08:18] that was always side effects no more
[04:08:23] I haven't claimed this yet I still
[04:08:24] haven't decided if I want wolfanger
[04:08:26] we'll see I guess kind of want wolfang
[04:08:28] but
[04:08:30] probably next stream
[04:08:33] okay chat within a day or two
[04:08:36] like how many forms will be open on the
[04:08:37] Discord

[04:08:45] know if I'll be able to but I really
[04:08:46] want to so I'll try to make it happen

[04:09:19] as [ __ ]
[04:09:21] um do you guys think I should play that
[04:09:22] account off stream because I don't know
[04:09:23] if I have time to play it on stream but
[04:09:25] I don't want to play offstream either so
[04:09:26] I don't [ __ ] know maybe I should just
[04:09:28] stream longer maybe I should just turn
[04:09:29] like six hours and I just do like two
[04:09:30] hours for you to play account at the end
[04:09:32] I don't know surely I'll be able to do
[04:09:34] that right surely
[04:09:38] um
[04:09:45] I wonder what my dear sister Lynette is

[04:10:19] [ __ ] welcome back thing you know
[04:10:22] but I feel like every time I log into it
[04:10:24] I'm like all right now we're gonna play
[04:10:25] it and then I review it and then I log
[04:10:26] out and I don't play it so we all we've
[04:10:28] done is the last three times we logged
[04:10:29] into it we just showed what the account
[04:10:30] had and then didn't play it
[04:10:33] surely we don't do that again right
[04:10:34] surely we don't do that again right
[04:10:36] surely we don't do that again right

[04:11:52] burst I didn't know he [ __ ] like
[04:11:54] posed like that I usually like swap or
[04:11:56] pressed e or [ __ ]
[04:11:58] what the hell it's kind of cool

[04:12:22] this the loot guide and no one's gonna
[04:12:23] watch it
[04:12:24] I'm pretty sure the thumbnail is made by
[04:12:27] the way like let me look let me look
[04:12:37] so long as the audience thinks that
[04:12:39] seeing is believing there's no limit to
[04:12:42] the number of tricks I can pull off

[04:14:54] like the new weapons and [ __ ]
[04:15:00] that's [ __ ] funny
[04:15:02] can't believe a whole last new region

[04:15:08] was Inazuma
[04:15:11] hahaha
[04:15:13] hip
