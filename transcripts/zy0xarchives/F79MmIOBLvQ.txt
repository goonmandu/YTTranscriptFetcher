[00:09:43] ready because I'm
[00:09:45] excited
[00:09:48] um yeah anyways uh yesterday I was in
[00:09:52] Montreal visiting family I came back at
[00:09:55] night at like 9:00 p.m. slept uh well
[00:09:58] stayed up a bit and then
[00:10:01] slept uh and now I'm here
[00:10:04] so yeah I I reviewed okay the Nikita guy
[00:10:07] out like seven days ago it is what it is
[00:10:09] I watched it it's good I'm going to
[00:10:11] upload it tomorrow I just need to put a
[00:10:12] weapon ranking in it
[00:10:15] um and second channel has been dead cuz
[00:10:20] apparently mari's SSD fried unlucky
[00:10:21] sorry rip Bozo uh but it's fine we're
[00:10:24] going to upload I'm uploading the like a
[00:10:27] skill issue compilation so made for it's
[00:10:29] it's disgusting it's [ __ ] terrible
[00:10:31] don't watch it it's actually really good
[00:10:33] but it it features a lot of out of
[00:10:35] context Clips where it looks like I'm
[00:10:36] bad at the game but I'm not uh it's
[00:10:38] pretty good though um anyways don't
[00:10:40] watch it uh but yeah n he a guide for
[00:10:43] the main channel is coming I'm going to
[00:10:44] start recording Shia and then duuke
[00:10:46] probably in terms of like guide videos
[00:10:48] uh I recorded a
[00:10:50] like characters to pull for video like
[00:10:52] literally before Navia came out I don't
[00:10:54] know where that is I don't know if it's
[00:10:55] done being edited or not but that should
[00:10:56] be out at some point um and and then
[00:10:59] some other video I don't know but those
[00:11:00] are like the big guys I'm going for I'm
[00:11:03] still looking for an Editor to do
[00:11:05] account reviews because I haven't
[00:11:07] uploaded an account review in literally
[00:11:08] years and I see everyone doing them and
[00:11:09] I still haven't so I'm mad at myself so
[00:11:12] if anyone can edit account reviews I I'm
[00:11:15] triing one person they haven't responded
[00:11:17] to me in like 5 days it is what it is
[00:11:19] look it is what it is but I'm triing one
[00:11:20] person we'll see how it goes
[00:11:24] um but anyways we'll see I can do it
[00:11:28] stop I'm not just going to listen you
[00:11:30] would I if I want to like look for new
[00:11:33] people I'd probably need like
[00:11:35] a I would probably need you to edit like
[00:11:38] I would probably make a try like like
[00:11:40] post a clip on like Twitter or something
[00:11:41] and then have someone edit it and then
[00:11:42] see how good it is what I did for the
[00:11:44] last edit app is I asked for portfolios
[00:11:47] which I got two PE three people that
[00:11:49] seemed pretty good um I dm'd all three
[00:11:52] of them and I'm still triing so we'll
[00:11:55] see how it goes the only problem is
[00:11:58] because some of it is just portfolio you
[00:12:00] can get people that aren't familiar with
[00:12:01] your or my content and they're you know
[00:12:03] very talented people but it's
[00:12:06] hard like I for what I'm looking for I
[00:12:09] need to make sure they understand like
[00:12:11] our memes so that it's I don't know it
[00:12:14] sounds cringe but yeah anyways I also
[00:12:17] need someone to like that understands
[00:12:19] genchan at least a
[00:12:20] bit um because if I'm making an account
[00:12:24] review and I say something that's like a
[00:12:27] like it's not their job to correct me
[00:12:29] but like sometimes I'll just say like
[00:12:31] something that's like I'll say like 21
[00:12:32] Critter rate instead of 24 for like Jade
[00:12:34] spear it's 22 I think but you get the
[00:12:36] point 24 is chow cuz you get 19 from
[00:12:39] ascending plus five but if I say like
[00:12:41] the wrong number or like something that
[00:12:42] like sounds off I'd want them to at
[00:12:44] least have a chance to know um C thanks
[00:12:47] for the Thousand bits I don't know if
[00:12:49] I'm doing uid reviews today though so I
[00:12:50] might have just scammed you but I'll
[00:12:52] save your U ID um
[00:12:55] anyways uh we'll see if you are are
[00:12:59] familiar with my content you have edited
[00:13:00] stuff before you can feel free to DM me
[00:13:02] I might not see it because I have a lot
[00:13:04] of message requests but that'd be cool
[00:13:06] like you can and I might open account
[00:13:08] viic uh editing applications later but
[00:13:10] I'm still tring people and I don't want
[00:13:11] to be mean to like I want to give them a
[00:13:13] chance before I'm like it's just that
[00:13:15] I'm annoyed because not at them but I'm
[00:13:16] annoyed because I feel like I should
[00:13:18] have had this done like [ __ ] five
[00:13:19] months ago because I've been needing
[00:13:20] editors for like five months it is what
[00:13:21] it is also for account
[00:13:24] reviews
[00:13:26] um I'm probably just going to take some
[00:13:29] random people from
[00:13:34] chat uh not today but I might because I
[00:13:38] opened cursed account review forums so
[00:13:41] here's what happened I wanted to do
[00:13:42] fixing someone's account where I spend a
[00:13:44] bunch of resin uh on a scuffed account
[00:13:46] and make it better I might still do that
[00:13:48] or I might just do a normal account
[00:13:49] review but if I do a like a scuffed one
[00:13:51] it would need to be an account that has
[00:13:53] some amount of fragile resin that I can
[00:13:54] spend like if not it would take a long
[00:13:57] time and they would have to to not be
[00:14:00] able to clear floor 12 like obviously if
[00:14:02] your account's cracked then that would
[00:14:04] be an account of VI for another day
[00:14:05] which we do right but for this one it
[00:14:08] would be like kind of a a scuffed
[00:14:10] account but I you can DM me if that's
[00:14:14] you but like it would have to actually
[00:14:15] be scuffed but we can look into that
[00:14:17] later because I'll probably open forms
[00:14:18] on Discord I did open some I went
[00:14:19] through them there's a few that were
[00:14:21] pretty good but there's always like I
[00:14:23] don't know I might DM some more people
[00:14:25] we'll see for now today we're going to
[00:14:27] be reacting to Abyss clears which that's
[00:14:28] done we're ready I'm just telling you
[00:14:30] guys my
[00:14:33] grievances slice say you Canada people
[00:14:35] don't eat food first of all that that
[00:14:38] was that's that sounds racist that
[00:14:40] that's
[00:14:41] not but we do eat food okay we do eat
[00:14:45] food uh I
[00:14:48] made what did I eat
[00:14:51] today out of coffee then I was like oh
[00:14:55] [ __ ] I have leftover rice so I cooked I
[00:14:57] put eggs in there I fried it I had rice
[00:15:01] with
[00:15:02] eggs and then
[00:15:05] I ate I ate something else I had
[00:15:09] something with protein I think I just
[00:15:11] had a protein shake yeah I just had a
[00:15:12] protein shake it's fine look it is what
[00:15:14] it is [ __ ]
[00:15:15] you
[00:15:18] um I do forget to eat a lot but that's
[00:15:20] not cuz I'm Canadian that's
[00:15:25] just literally none of that was a meal
[00:15:28] but okay what you I'm living alone right
[00:15:30] now what do you want me to do I'm not
[00:15:32] going to cook five
[00:15:33] courses I just put rice with like sauce
[00:15:37] like soy sauce and like eggs and I like
[00:15:39] [ __ ] I was like okay I'll eat this
[00:15:41] and then I made a shake cuz I'm like
[00:15:42] okay I probably should have protein and
[00:15:44] then that's
[00:15:47] it cooking is a good life skill I can
[00:15:49] cook but I don't have what do you think
[00:15:51] I have in my fridge I think I'm going to
[00:15:54] go out to the store buy some [ __ ]
[00:15:56] chicken and then walk back home
[00:15:59] I'm a gamer I'm not I'm not going to go
[00:16:02] outside I know how to
[00:16:06] cook
[00:16:09] anyways
[00:16:10] um anyways welcome to the
[00:16:14] stream welcome to the stream on doing
[00:16:17] groceries feels nice yeah uh I do that
[00:16:19] once every
[00:16:21] like I don't know two weeks I don't know
[00:16:25] but we don't we have I have food in the
[00:16:28] house but it's not like cookable food
[00:16:30] like I have like stuff it's not like I
[00:16:32] don't have stuff it's just like I don't
[00:16:34] have like like meat like I'm not like
[00:16:36] stalking my fridge with
[00:16:40] meat I don't know whatever it's fine uh
[00:16:44] well to the
[00:16:47] stream yeah a lot of people ask me if
[00:16:49] I'm going to do a gaming guide dude I
[00:16:51] really want to I just don't know what my
[00:16:53] life has been the past two weeks uh
[00:16:55] which is the only reason why it's not
[00:16:56] done I think it's all done except the
[00:16:58] combo section but I can't be bothered
[00:17:00] cuz the Jeff told me that you could do
[00:17:01] like the Draven thing where you have
[00:17:03] three axes out at the same time where
[00:17:05] you like cue and then you catch your dog
[00:17:06] midair and I've been trying to do it and
[00:17:08] I got it and like I understand how it
[00:17:10] works but I still think it's the most
[00:17:11] copium thing and I hate this because
[00:17:13] whenever someone or a TC tells me like
[00:17:16] some super like technical way to like
[00:17:19] make your character do more damage and
[00:17:20] then it's like a lot of effort for
[00:17:22] barely anything more in practice it
[00:17:23] tilts me cuz I feel like I need to add
[00:17:25] it to the guide and then it delays it
[00:17:26] for like a week when I shouldn't do it
[00:17:28] and I probably should have just ignored
[00:17:29] him but it actually does work pretty
[00:17:31] well uh it's just I don't think it's
[00:17:32] worth doing for like the average Andy
[00:17:34] but I'm probably still going to add it
[00:17:35] to the video uh and that's why it's been
[00:17:37] delayed so I don't know if I'm even
[00:17:38] going to do it but hopefully I will Nita
[00:17:40] guide is done uh surely I just send the
[00:17:43] ging after but no promises we'll see
[00:17:46] anyways no more stalling let's start the
[00:17:48] stream I hope you're all you're all

[00:20:49] zeox but again ladies and gentlemen for
[00:20:52] the most part this is just effectively
[00:20:54] what I have been seeing posted hundreds
[00:20:57] of thousands of times through the course
[00:20:59] of the last two weeks that I still can't
[00:21:01] even properly nail down so let me give
[00:21:03] you an idea the first actual Ground Zero
[00:21:06] of this Jihad was zeox okay an
[00:21:08] individual who
[00:21:11] zeox well first it was zionic now it is
[00:21:22] theox but this guy's cool I didn't I

[00:21:52] asked so initially I asked twitch like
[00:21:54] yo can I get 1 x and then like my
[00:21:56] brother has the the normal account and
[00:21:57] then he was is like they're like no [ __ ]
[00:21:59] you but then I got a partner manager and
[00:22:00] they're cool so I think I could but I'd
[00:22:02] have to like go through a process and I

[00:27:52] strangling nice okay daily quote do not
[00:27:57] fall PR to the darkness I have no mercy
[00:27:59] though perhaps you can stand your ground
[00:28:01] alone who's afraid of who's Darkness I
[00:28:04] feel like Shia would say Darkness I have
[00:28:06] no
[00:28:08] mercy
[00:28:10] Darkness I know Shia says those memories
[00:28:14] so dark but I don't know if he says do
[00:28:16] not fall prey to the darkness who would
[00:28:18] say that um who's like fighting the
[00:28:21] darkness
[00:28:25] nahita this feels like an edgy character
[00:28:27] though like [ __ ] would wander say
[00:28:29] this I don't think it's Chia but I'm
[00:28:31] going to guess him just in case oh my
[00:28:33] God it is okay well my instincts told me
[00:28:36] Shia I got it I got it it would have
[00:28:38] been embarrassing if I didn't get it let
[00:28:39] me open in chat are you guys Ming me no
[00:28:40] you're not it would have been
[00:28:41] embarrassing if I didn't get it but I
[00:28:43] got it I got it my first instinct was
[00:28:45] this could be Shia but I haven't heard
[00:28:47] the voice line in a bit do not fall prey
[00:28:49] to the darkness I have no mercy yeah
[00:28:52] like he doesn't say this normally like
[00:28:54] you never hear this while playing Ground
[00:28:56] alone let me look let me Google this
[00:28:57] when does he say cuz you like I knew
[00:28:59] this this gave me sh Vibes but you don't
[00:29:01] hear this when you're just like playing
[00:29:09] him what
[00:29:11] bro
[00:29:15] bro yeah it's about us about us trust
[00:29:19] like you don't [ __ ] hear this while
[00:29:21] playing but I got it I got
[00:29:26] it
[00:29:34] okay there is now a
[00:29:37] mess in my underg gard Ms this looks
[00:29:40] like a charge
[00:29:41] shot um it looks like a cryo arrow for
[00:29:45] some reason but I don't think it's gone
[00:29:46] you I I don't know who else has like a
[00:29:48] targeting thing uh I don't think it's
[00:29:50] gone you for some reason could it be
[00:29:53] like albo e no albo e is like a flower
[00:29:56] um I actually don't know who has a
[00:29:58] targeting thing like
[00:30:02] that I still don't know who has a
[00:30:04] targeting thing like that riff oh it's
[00:30:06] [ __ ]
[00:30:07] shenan okay that's cringe though uh star
[00:30:10] rail let's do the star rail de to prove
[00:30:12] that I'm a star rail gamer um okay we'll
[00:30:15] guess [ __ ] okay well I blade I guess
[00:30:20] could be blade it's not blade um okay
[00:30:24] we'll do AA okay it's not Asa uh could
[00:30:27] be braon no can't could be who the [ __ ]
[00:30:30] uses
[00:30:32] these so I want to guess someone with
[00:30:34] the ice boss M like the the the the the
[00:30:36] the blue one I'm not sure I know BR uses
[00:30:39] this I know AA uses this other
[00:30:40] characters I don't know because I feel
[00:30:42] like I haven't had that many characters
[00:30:44] use this maybe I'm forgetting but I
[00:30:46] don't know let's guess based on world
[00:30:47] it's probably jillo V who's the jillo V
[00:30:49] cely but she doesn't use that cely uses
[00:30:51] these mats uh who else is Jovi Natasha
[00:30:54] she is I don't know what boss match I
[00:30:56] mean what match she uses though I'm
[00:30:58] going to click her but I could be wrong
[00:31:00] [ __ ] I was wrong what the [ __ ] are these
[00:31:02] it's fine it's jillo v um so hook is
[00:31:06] from drillo but it can't be
[00:31:08] hook um who else is from drillo uh help
[00:31:12] me Mr sarog what's her name claraa but
[00:31:13] it can't be claraa cuz physical uh who
[00:31:15] else is from Dillo cely but it can't be
[00:31:18] her well she's like am I think of
[00:31:20] Underworld I'm think of under wait Servo
[00:31:22] oh my God it has to be Servo wait cuz BR
[00:31:24] uses these and they're like
[00:31:29] Servo is lightning servo's

[00:32:30] this I've never played this character in
[00:32:33] my life it's giving me her of Vibes cuz

[00:33:11] cool okay I see you do not fall prey to
[00:33:14] the
[00:33:21] darkness that's why he's the best
[00:33:24] character that's why Shia is the
[00:33:31] uh oh yeah
[00:33:34] also okay a few things first of all dude
[00:33:38] I was yapping so long here that by the
[00:33:41] time I finished this thread my like 1
[00:33:43] hour [ __ ] or I don't know there's
[00:33:45] like an hour left in like my train ride
[00:33:47] and it was done I was like there I was
[00:33:48] like what the [ __ ] that's how long I
[00:33:49] yapped for um but yeah regarding I was
[00:33:53] looking at like weaing wave characters
[00:33:54] dude this guy is very hot I I I I would
[00:33:57] like to publicly apologize for once
[00:33:59] saying that his Dragon was budget Genji
[00:34:02] at home but I don't care okay budget
[00:34:04] Genji is still better than no Genji so
[00:34:07] I'm my bad on that he looks really cool
[00:34:09] though so I'm probably going to M him um
[00:34:10] there's also that one girl that looks
[00:34:11] cool but I forget her
[00:34:13] name um so yeah he looks cool I'm very
[00:34:16] excited
[00:34:18] um as I said though you don't choose
[00:34:21] your main your main chooses you you you
[00:34:24] everyone like you it's it's actually the
[00:34:27] illusion of free choice zff thanks for
[00:34:29] the 40 months that's my first 40 month
[00:34:31] sub and it ties into my point you don't
[00:34:33] choose your main your main chooses you
[00:34:35] without even if zff doesn't even play a
[00:34:37] [ __ ] game I know who he's going to
[00:34:39] pick I know that he would play Bennett
[00:34:41] even if Bennett was [ __ ] dog [ __ ] if
[00:34:43] Bennett was the worst unit he would
[00:34:44] still play Bennett me
[00:34:47] personally that's how I feel about like
[00:34:49] dea Shia like I I put day on a bunch of
[00:34:52] teams even though she's you know H you
[00:34:55] know a little
[00:34:57] not at the same level of the as the
[00:34:59] others she's like not you know she's
[00:35:02] she's
[00:35:03] following she's doing her best and
[00:35:05] that's what
[00:35:06] matters she's doing what her
[00:35:09] best um also I unironic okay this is not
[00:35:14] a joke I didn't tweet this as a [ __ ]
[00:35:15] post I unironically showed my brother
[00:35:18] this and he actually thought it was like
[00:35:20] I I showed him this and he like laughed
[00:35:23] and then I was
[00:35:24] like I don't know what I said but he was
[00:35:26] like wait isn't you I was like wait what
[00:35:29] the [ __ ] did I
[00:35:32] say I don't know I was like people
[00:35:34] thinks this like think people think this
[00:35:36] looks like me and he's like what the
[00:35:37] [ __ ] it's not you and I was like okay
[00:35:40] I'm killing myself dude ah it's not me
[00:35:44] but I did find this uh I saw a [ __ ]
[00:35:47] piece of clothing that looked like that
[00:35:48] so I bought it it was like five bucks I
[00:35:50] was like a thrift uh Thrift Shop it was
[00:35:52] like this like weird it was like
[00:35:53] underground it was like under I went
[00:35:55] underground and there's like this like
[00:35:56] huge thrift shop and they're like
[00:35:57] blasting like heavy metal I was like
[00:35:59] damn this is sick and then I was like
[00:36:01] that so I bought it but I'm not doing
[00:36:02] this but anyways so that's not me for
[00:36:05] the record I don't know who it is but
[00:36:07] it's not
[00:36:08] me um also I saw today that drud has my
[00:36:11] moan compilation bookmarked on his
[00:36:14] [ __ ] taskbar uh so whoever made that
[00:36:17] I believe it was impact let me look it
[00:36:19] up Z moan compilation whoever made this
[00:36:22] video uh oh no it was it's not impact
[00:36:24] it's ryuko another Clipper uh you
[00:36:27] deserve to be uh Behind Bars quite
[00:36:30] frankly no disrespect to you but this
[00:36:33] has been this has done irreparable
[00:36:35] damage to my uh image and digital
[00:36:38] footprint now not just because it's like
[00:36:40] a mo compilation but one they're taking
[00:36:42] out of context it's not Mo and two the
[00:36:44] last half Is Random clips which makes
[00:36:46] the compilation looks longer look look
[00:36:49] that's so funny oh my God is that 120
[00:36:52] see this isn't moaning so it's like if
[00:36:54] anything it's like 8 minutes of moans
[00:36:56] okay but you oh 20 minutes 20 minutes
[00:36:58] it's not 20 it's not 20 it's like 5
[00:37:02] minutes at most it's not
[00:37:11] 20
[00:37:14] anyways
[00:37:16] anyways so that's that now we're caught
[00:37:19] up I think oh yeah I rolled this piece
[00:37:21] on mobile I got it pretty good good for
[00:37:23] uh Barista but I it rolled not bad it
[00:37:27] was kind of Thanos but then it rolled an
[00:37:28] extra crit actually not bad it only
[00:37:30] missed once into defense uh 10 crit rate
[00:37:32] 10 crit damage attack actually pretty
[00:37:33] good if someone uses this goblet uh who
[00:37:37] yeah the cry
[00:37:39] archon Sask what do you mean Sask okay
[00:37:42] realistically it's [ __ ] natland next
[00:37:45] we're going to get the Pyro archon in
[00:37:46] 5.2 and then the cry archon in in chzn
[00:37:49] in 6.2 [ __ ] the Barista boom she
[00:37:52] comes out I don't know what the [ __ ]
[00:37:53] she'll use but let's say I'm I mean I'm
[00:37:55] guessing crowd catalst
[00:37:57] Sask she's going to spam her skill use
[00:37:59] Golden tro boom we're goated or
[00:38:01] Vermilion cuz everyone can use Vermilion
[00:38:03] wait why is there smudge on my glasses
[00:38:05] everyone can use Vermillion so I have a
[00:38:07] good Vermillion Crow goblet anyways so
[00:38:08] I'm
[00:38:12] ready wait one
[00:38:15] sec [ __ ] smudged something on my
[00:38:17] glasses I don't know what
[00:38:18] happened
[00:38:23] anyways
[00:38:24] um yeah last stream we did the peny
[00:38:27] quest it was good for those of you who
[00:38:29] missed
[00:38:30] it uh
[00:38:33] yeah yeah scar out feet pck donated $5
[00:38:38] thank you you once said that if you
[00:38:39] Triple Crown Raiden it's because you
[00:38:41] want her to Peg you is this true for
[00:38:44] other characters okay scar Mo feed piix
[00:38:45] oh my resin just capped thank you for
[00:38:47] the uh $5 for some reason the me saying
[00:38:52] if you Triple Crown Ryden you want to
[00:38:53] get pegged has been quoted I've heard
[00:38:56] people say that this like like [ __ ]
[00:38:58] 20 times at this point it wasn't me
[00:39:00] meant to be an inspirational quote but
[00:39:02] it is true because why else would you
[00:39:04] level her normal attacks uh it's not
[00:39:07] true for every character because a lot
[00:39:09] of characters you know you want to Le
[00:39:11] Crown their abilities their useful
[00:39:13] abilities but Ryan's normal attack does
[00:39:15] literally nothing so crowning it just
[00:39:17] says more about you than you
[00:39:19] think uh with that in mind I have the
[00:39:22] daily commission called good sign uh
[00:39:26] which means
[00:39:27] we might get an achievement I did this
[00:39:28] like twice more I did this at least once

[00:41:52] should claim like uh shenan so we might
[00:41:54] do that um or
[00:42:02] guming but yeah so that's the plan

[00:47:27] combat less like a stop yapping sorry
[00:47:31] what is it what's up uh yeah yeah
[00:47:35] supports aren't really supports a lot of

[00:53:21] need strong box I need I need materials
[00:53:24] to St box really I mean uh we'll
[00:53:26] probably do emblem with slice that was
[00:53:28] the plan we both do emblem not vermilion
[00:53:31] emblem not
[00:53:36] Vermillion On's Abyss reset nobody tell
[00:53:39] them nobody tell them no
[00:53:48] snitches
[00:53:49] okay do you think Primos for resin is
[00:53:52] more valuable than Primos for PS
[00:53:56] listen here actually this this the music
[00:53:59] is appropriate in this instance I'm
[00:54:00] sorry I'm sorry in advance if you're
[00:54:02] annoyed about it but
[00:54:06] listen let's say we live in a perfect
[00:54:08] world oh genin impact is released like a
[00:54:12] great RPG you can collect every
[00:54:14] character for free you don't need to
[00:54:16] spend you don't even need Primo jams you
[00:54:18] get them as you play we don't live in
[00:54:20] that world let's say Okay genin's a God
[00:54:22] game sure it's God trip okay but
[00:54:25] we have endgame so you need good
[00:54:28] artifacts to beat it but there's
[00:54:30] something more to do there's something
[00:54:32] to do once you get the perfect artifact
[00:54:34] once your sh looks like mine once your
[00:54:36] nevet has has this this amazing circlet
[00:54:39] it's not that good but once you have
[00:54:41] good pieces oh there's something else to
[00:54:43] do I acquired all my artifacts now I can
[00:54:46] go raid with my friends I can go do a
[00:54:48] domain with uh dungeon I could go in the
[00:54:51] teapot and PVP is in the game I could go
[00:54:55] do floor 133
[00:54:57] 1450 I could go do [ __ ] pure
[00:55:01] fiction the swarmm added the
[00:55:04] genin wow so much to do then maybe it's
[00:55:08] worth refreshing maybe it's worth hey
[00:55:11] you know what I explored all day I got
[00:55:12] 50 Primos let's go spend my resin you
[00:55:14] know what let's get more resin let's
[00:55:16] let's Farm the artifacts so we have I
[00:55:19] can I can actually beat the content that
[00:55:21] I've been trying to beat but as it
[00:55:23] stands we have not gotten more endgame
[00:55:26] since version 1.0 the launch of genin
[00:55:30] now yeah this has gotten harder I've
[00:55:33] gotten harder maybe you have too but
[00:55:36] genin we don't currently have anything
[00:55:39] to strive to beat once you beat 412
[00:55:41] still play the game hey I'm looking
[00:55:43] forward to the story Senora might come
[00:55:45] back AR Lino might come we we might get
[00:55:47] a lot of stuff but as it currently
[00:55:49] stands there's no current endgame goal
[00:55:52] past 4or 12 so
[00:55:55] this brings me back to your question so
[00:55:57] should I spend Primos on resin or
[00:55:59] characters well what's more important to
[00:56:02] you rushing through your artifacts so
[00:56:05] you get everything people say zck I wish
[00:56:07] I had unlimited resin I wish they gave
[00:56:09] us more resin and I do too but what then
[00:56:12] imagine you had twice as much resen
[00:56:14] imagine you got all artifacts then what
[00:56:17] then what you beat floor 12 then what
[00:56:19] you're going to quit there's nothing to
[00:56:21] do there's no there's nothing else to
[00:56:23] do so
[00:56:26] please if it's up to me and I can save
[00:56:29] your life it's not too late spend your
[00:56:31] Primo gems on characters get the
[00:56:33] characters you want have never let oh oh
[00:56:36] look at this oh I've never let I can I
[00:56:38] can [ __ ] whip it out anytime oh oh oh
[00:56:41] I'm I'm Shen Yun I'm I'm I'm I'm where
[00:56:44] is she where is she I'm Shen Yun I have
[00:56:47] personalities bigger than my head that
[00:56:49] might make you happy maybe it doesn't
[00:56:51] maybe it does but you know what
[00:56:53] certainly won't make you happy
[00:56:55] more
[00:56:56] resin if the sole purpose is to get
[00:56:59] artifacts faster for the non-existent
[00:57:02] content that is endgame a lot of content
[00:57:04] in the game but no nothing difficult
[00:57:08] past Abyss 12 with that in
[00:57:12] mind I think the first 50 Primo gems is
[00:57:14] fine to like the first refresh is okay
[00:57:16] after that uh unless you are a
[00:57:18] degenerate like me not
[00:57:22] recommended anyways welcome to the
[00:57:24] stream uh
[00:57:25] um I have to uncount my resen attack
[00:57:32] attack settle
[00:57:37] down
[00:57:38] uh yeah I mean okay real talk though
[00:57:42] dude people people actually
[00:57:45] listen all I'm saying is if we get like
[00:57:49] imagine dude imagine the monetization
[00:57:51] system if you're Mr genin impact let's
[00:57:53] say I'm Mr genin impact this is my my
[00:57:55] train of thinking okay you add like a
[00:57:58] hidden mode like a new mode right but
[00:58:00] you like that's like actual end game
[00:58:02] like you can like raid with your friends
[00:58:03] okay but you only add it you only get
[00:58:06] the popup that it exists once you beat
[00:58:08] floor 8 so you unlock floor 9 10 11 12
[00:58:10] right then you get to pop out hey you
[00:58:12] want to try this mode out so it doesn't
[00:58:14] scare new players there's no excessive
[00:58:15] anxiety [ __ ] uh teapot Terry isn't
[00:58:18] [ __ ] [ __ ] his pants [ __ ] story
[00:58:21] Sally isn't [ __ ] pissing her pants
[00:58:23] it's all good it just so hey you want to
[00:58:25] do this you can no anxiety it's not that
[00:58:27] you know there's scalable difficulties
[00:58:29] there's nothing stressful the Primo gems
[00:58:31] are in the early modes and the later you
[00:58:33] go you get cool untradeable things you
[00:58:35] get a weapon you get a skin you get a
[00:58:37] glider your name card's animated your
[00:58:38] profile picture has like a golden border
[00:58:40] you can customize [ __ ] you got a [ __ ]
[00:58:42] net takes the shirt off whatever
[00:58:44] whatever you want but this is where it
[00:58:47] comes in because yeah you can beat it
[00:58:49] all free to play you can do it all just
[00:58:52] by grinding but people don't want to do
[00:58:54] that

[01:00:05] weapon you get if you fully clear it
[01:00:07] right for the first time there's a one
[01:00:08] in 10 chance if you full clear it you
[01:00:10] get a weapon right oh I want to do that
[01:00:14] okay so you want to do with your friend
[01:00:15] but your friend he's just he's kind of
[01:00:17] carrying but he can't do enough he has a
[01:00:19] C6 nevet he's he's destroying everything
[01:00:21] but you just feel like dead weight so
[01:00:23] your friend's not going to guilt you
[01:00:24] he's not an [ __ ] he's like oh nice
[01:00:26] try guys we'll get it next week but you
[01:00:28] know that hey you're the anchor here
[01:00:30] something's not quite right so he say
[01:00:32] you know what [ __ ] it man [ __ ] it I'll
[01:00:34] swipe my credit card you pull for a five
[01:00:36] star you say you know what I don't need
[01:00:38] Shang Ling I need Nita pull for Nita you
[01:00:41] pull for for for Shia you pull for for
[01:00:44] for for Hut
[01:00:46] Yia cause them no harm think about the
[01:00:50] monetization if I am John genin impact I
[01:00:54] just made a billion dollar from adding a
[01:00:57] mode where friends where you can co-op
[01:00:59] and that's challenging right a bunch of
[01:01:01] people oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I don't need to
[01:01:03] spend but I don't know this cuz I just
[01:01:05] started playing [ __ ] it minus one
[01:01:08] house I need a character so that my my
[01:01:11] friend doesn't hate me I need to raid
[01:01:13] with him I don't want him to hate mey so
[01:01:16] they S1 anded me 45 for the current
[01:01:20] veterans let's say you're free to play
[01:01:22] You're like hey man I play this game
[01:01:24] every I don't spend money I have strong
[01:01:26] morals you know I explore I 100% at
[01:01:29] everything you can clear it too you know
[01:01:31] it won't be like whale only but you'll
[01:01:34] need good
[01:01:35] artifacts but for the players that are
[01:01:37] you know newer don't have good artifacts
[01:01:39] don't want to play don't spend their
[01:01:41] resin they'll be like you know what man
[01:01:43] [ __ ] it I need I need to whale it must
[01:01:46] be and now I'm not here to encourage
[01:01:49] wailing but if you're you know get an
[01:01:52] impact you're thinking hm that's a good
[01:01:54] way to monetize it and current players
[01:01:56] will be like huh there's a new game mode
[01:01:58] I can do with my friends which boom
[01:02:00] makes money for them uh makes them happy
[01:02:02] and makes money for them and Lastly
[01:02:06] lastly the the the players the players
[01:02:09] from other games right the people that
[01:02:11] are like oh my God I have friends I want
[01:02:12] them to play with me but they won't play
[01:02:13] with me because we can't do anything
[01:02:15] maybe they'll try the game maybe they'll
[01:02:17] finally come join me maybe maybe they'll
[01:02:20] actually come and I'll come and maybe
[01:02:22] we'll all play together
[01:02:27] wow
[01:02:28] wow gen players have no friends dude I
[01:02:31] actually think wasn't that like why
[01:02:33] genin was made wasn't that like a press
[01:02:35] conference and they were like this is
[01:02:36] for the game with like no friends so you
[01:02:38] could have like your like wuss and
[01:02:40] friends and then it's like a soul that's
[01:02:42] why which means I don't think we're ever
[01:02:44] going to get what I want but it'd be
[01:02:45] cool I don't think we're ever going to
[01:02:47] but it would be cool maybe in version
[01:02:49] 8.0 when we get [ __ ] D's leaf and the
[01:02:52] abyss and the quantum element is
[01:02:57] released but it would be
[01:03:02] cool I don't know why I just yapped for
[01:03:04] like 20
[01:03:07] minutes it sounds insanely unprofitable
[01:03:10] no it's okay okay I'm going to give you
[01:03:12] 30 second explanation as to why I think
[01:03:14] it's actually not a bad idea one you
[01:03:17] make it scalable difficulties so there's
[01:03:19] like something that every player can do
[01:03:20] and you give Primo gems at the start but
[01:03:22] then the later words don't have to be
[01:03:23] Primo gems cuz the people that get that
[01:03:24] far would just want cool things to
[01:03:25] collect or stuff that Buffs her account
[01:03:27] and then three and this is the most
[01:03:29] important thing oh no three and four
[01:03:31] three you don't have to like advertise
[01:03:32] it to anyone like it literally can just
[01:03:33] be like a bonus mode that people like
[01:03:35] but it doesn't have to be like the main
[01:03:36] thing cuz story players are still going
[01:03:37] to [ __ ] play for the story so it
[01:03:38] won't hurt the player base at all and it
[01:03:40] will attract new players and then four
[01:03:41] and the most important thing is uh that
[01:03:44] wait shut the [ __ ] up I'm getting
[01:03:45] distracted no no how dare you support
[01:03:47] the stream I'm sorry I appreciate it uh
[01:03:49] four and the most important thing is
[01:03:52] that because it's added
[01:03:55] oh yeah you can reuse a lot of content
[01:03:57] and Dev time that's already been made so
[01:03:59] for example a lot of the events that are
[01:04:00] really cool they end as soon as they get
[01:04:02] good you notice this the like oh this
[01:04:04] started to be challenging this is fun
[01:04:05] ends last day the last day is cool the
[01:04:08] the first five days are [ __ ] baby o
[01:04:09] clock for [ __ ] toddlers playing on
[01:04:11] their on their on their Nintendo switch
[01:04:13] it is what it is I mean it's not out
[01:04:15] okay no switch but you get the point and
[01:04:17] it's cool I like a lot of the events I
[01:04:18] think a lot of the design of the events
[01:04:20] are amazing but they're like 20 days
[01:04:22] only 30 days only 40 days only two weeks
[01:04:24] right but imagine we got a really like
[01:04:27] they retake like the Labyrinth event
[01:04:29] they make it permanent scalable
[01:04:30] difficulty hard with rewards you could
[01:04:32] do with your friends boom that is very
[01:04:35] low Dev time yeah you'd have to like
[01:04:37] balance it a little but it's already
[01:04:38] been deved boom GG and it makes money
[01:04:42] like I would bet my life I would give
[01:04:45] them my Twitch account if I'm wrong I
[01:04:47] bet anything that it would be
[01:04:53] profitable
[01:04:56] you think most people agree with you on
[01:04:57] that bro I literally Zio end the game I
[01:05:01] I talked about this like three no two
[01:05:03] years ago well one and a half years ago
[01:05:05] now
[01:05:09] [Applause]
[01:05:13] um I mean I showed this on stream
[01:05:15] earlier I literally made a video about
[01:05:16] this MH reacted he was
[01:05:19] like anxiety for certain types of
[01:05:21] players but where is it a way to play
[01:05:23] with friends
[01:05:24] I literally yapped about this like 20
[01:05:25] minutes for everyone but there's no real
[01:05:27] reason why they would not release other
[01:05:30] content similar to The Abyss or perhaps
[01:05:32] even better right like again Co-op
[01:05:34] dungeons that you can clear with friends
[01:05:35] or solo content or making some events
[01:05:37] permanent other than the fact that it
[01:05:39] might cause anxiety for certain types of
[01:05:41] players but like that really isn't shut
[01:05:44] the who is getting anxiety about the
[01:05:48] game on
[01:05:50] true you know it's like they keep saying
[01:05:53] oh maybe
[01:05:55] who me okay to be fair I do but only
[01:05:58] when it's the two [ __ ] like the furry
[01:06:00] [ __ ] in the abyss that like yeah
[01:06:02] those two the Scorpion and [ __ ] part the
[01:06:04] player base is getting anxiety about
[01:06:06] like oh there's a tough enemy for me to
[01:06:08] fight I want to give up playing longer
[01:06:12] it is a you know what I'm saying every
[01:06:13] has their reason for playing the game
[01:06:15] and for a lot of us it is the combat
[01:06:16] system now another thing I quickly want
[01:06:18] to touch on is actually the of the
[01:06:20] fourar characters in the game right now
[01:06:22] oh yeah yeah I already rected yeah this
[01:06:23] one fourar I remember well they didn't
[01:06:25] suck but we got like eight bad four
[01:06:26] stars in a row or some [ __ ] where yeah
[01:06:28] you'll use them because they're cute but
[01:06:29] you're never going to recommend them
[01:06:31] from for example Cole typically just
[01:06:33] being worse than the dendro main
[01:06:35] character Dory who's Dory and arguably
[01:06:37] Candace as well Sara who's okay Candace
[01:06:39] got buffed got there's some teams that
[01:06:43] can use her but even then there's
[01:06:44] usually better options and even then
[01:06:46] it's like extremely Niche and the same
[01:06:48] can be said about some other inauma
[01:06:49] characters and the state of the four
[01:06:50] stars we're getting in sumaru now
[01:06:52] another thing that I didn't even mention
[01:06:53] in this video yet but that is a pretty
[01:06:56] big slap in the face as well is when
[01:06:57] they talked about the original resin
[01:06:59] there was a question asked in the
[01:07:01] interview yes basically asking if
[01:07:02] there's a chance we get an increase in
[01:07:04] original resin oration basically just
[01:07:07] more resin so we can do more domains
[01:07:08] more content every day and they
[01:07:10] basically said no pretty much just said
[01:07:13] a bunch of words that didn't make sense
[01:07:15] to just no mega said hey we do we give
[01:07:18] you we give you stuff in our events do
[01:07:21] our events anyways
[01:07:25] while this is definitely a copy pasta of
[01:07:27] all time uh what is
[01:07:30] this try OverWatch too I'm trying to I
[01:07:33] can't even log in I I'm I'm trying to
[01:07:35] get in there's other games I want to
[01:07:37] play do I want to cover this probably
[01:07:39] not but you know I can't even get into
[01:07:41] this game right now unfortunately or
[01:07:43] else I or else I would but am truly
[01:07:46] passionate about the game I just feel
[01:07:47] like basically talking about this is
[01:07:49] important this isn't me saying we should
[01:07:51] quit but it's me saying we should at
[01:07:52] least complain and at least try to get
[01:07:54] better content and be concerned with the
[01:07:55] way things are going because if we want
[01:07:57] longevity in this game and we want to
[01:07:59] enjoy it and be able to actually use the
[01:08:01] artifacts we've been giving negative
[01:08:03] feedback and complaining when the devs
[01:08:05] are disconnected from the player base is
[01:08:07] something that we that I believe we as
[01:08:09] players and content creator should
[01:08:11] do agreed what do you mean rare Zog W
[01:08:14] I've been having the same W's for like
[01:08:16] three years people just act like I don't
[01:08:19] the issue I'm going to tell you
[01:08:20] something and this is going to really
[01:08:22] suck the issue
[01:08:24] is the devs aren't
[01:08:28] disconnected they're doing
[01:08:30] exactly what they need to do to make
[01:08:33] another $4 billion unfortunately Zio all
[01:08:37] because you and I and there's 2,000
[01:08:41] people in chat I think a lot of people
[01:08:43] here agree some people
[01:08:47] disagree no that's true the combat is
[01:08:51] not important to the majority that's why
[01:08:54] like I don't call this is an old video
[01:08:56] like I don't say [ __ ] like oh devs are
[01:08:58] disconnected cuz like realistically it's
[01:09:00] the game isn't made for people like me
[01:09:03] like I love the game but like it's
[01:09:05] definitely like and I hope we get
[01:09:07] [ __ ] endgame but like I know that
[01:09:10] it's just going to it's that's not what
[01:09:12] is like on their priority list and I
[01:09:15] don't know exactly the reasons why but I
[01:09:18] know that it's
[01:09:20] not you know it's made for casuals it is
[01:09:22] what it is you know
[01:09:25] but
[01:09:31] yeah is chat delayed I I don't I have
[01:09:33] like the minimum delay like I try
[01:09:35] there's no delay on the stream but it's
[01:09:36] whatever it is right
[01:09:37] so all good all good I don't know why I
[01:09:41] thought of this video I don't know what
[01:09:42] brought me to zos Clips stun lock
[01:09:46] [Music]
[01:09:49] Edition anyways you want good deepwood
[01:09:52] you probably want good okay yeah no
[01:09:54] stunlock but
[01:09:58] yeah I mean I yeah I only bring this up
[01:10:01] cuz I really do like the combat system
[01:10:02] and I just wish like I've accepted that
[01:10:05] I'm not going to get some of the things
[01:10:05] that I want but like could you imagine
[01:10:08] if I could actually like display skill
[01:10:13] like in like content where it matters
[01:10:14] like that would literally be like
[01:10:16] Peak before I'm dude it's going to come
[01:10:18] out when I'm a boomer I won't even be
[01:10:20] able to play I'll have like no reaction
[01:10:22] time
[01:10:27] have you done speedr running stuff I had
[01:10:29] the like okay it's technically tied in
[01:10:32] sh M it's literally still there but I
[01:10:33] got a faster one but I didn't submit it
[01:10:35] cuz I don't want to I don't really feel
[01:10:36] like starting [ __ ] cuz I didn't like the
[01:10:38] the old person that owned the it doesn't
[01:10:40] matter but I still to this day am tied
[01:10:42] for the fastest sh time in one of the
[01:10:44] old like Abyss clears when I used to
[01:10:46] speed run a show when the abyss wasn't
[01:10:47] [ __ ]
[01:10:49] disgustingly disgusting to speedrun it
[01:10:51] was like the ruin guards and [ __ ] it
[01:10:52] like 10 seconds it was cool but now I
[01:10:54] don't care it's it's weird I don't like
[01:10:56] seding Abyss anymore I find it cringe
[01:10:59] cuz it's like spam resetting I saw
[01:11:00] someone like okay no disrespect cuz I
[01:11:03] love all Shia Mains you're all the goat
[01:11:05] but I saw this like one Shia player that
[01:11:06] was like insane Shia time and like every
[01:11:09] time he reset he was like swearing he
[01:11:11] like like full molding like I I get it
[01:11:13] I've been there it's just I don't want
[01:11:14] to do that to myself like I don't want
[01:11:16] to be like the like spam resetting
[01:11:18] fishing for crits like it
[01:11:22] isn't
[01:11:24] anyways um is there anything else that's
[01:11:27] all we need to talk about I mean I I
[01:11:29] wasn't planning to talk about this
[01:11:41] but I thought you already do that
[01:11:46] okay shut up
[01:11:49] Julian so is it efficient to use Primos
[01:11:51] on resin okay don't get me stop Lo again
[01:11:54] isn't TCG end game mode I actually think
[01:11:56] TCG like okay no it's unrelated to the
[01:11:59] main game I like it's basically a second
[01:12:01] game which is f if you like it you like
[01:12:02] it I think TCG would be a lot more
[01:12:04] viable if it had a competitive like
[01:12:06] ladder cuz like you'd be like oh but
[01:12:08] people don't want competitive modes it's
[01:12:09] like sure but like what is the benefit
[01:12:12] of me being good at tcg like I go play
[01:12:14] in like a tournament okay cool but like
[01:12:16] outside of that like that's
[01:12:22] it competitive ladder is stressful it is
[01:12:25] but like think of it as like okay if I
[01:12:27] can't overcome my fear of clicking Q up
[01:12:30] in a ranked game I'm probably not going
[01:12:32] to overcome many of my fears in life so
[01:12:34] take that as the first step look I have
[01:12:36] ranked anxiety sometimes too but just
[01:12:37] [ __ ] queue it up just [ __ ] queue
[01:12:39] it up you just got to do
[01:12:42] it or just play casually but like you
[01:12:47] know oh I mean crit rate on the set is
[01:12:49] kind of cold but this could be really
[01:12:52] good
[01:12:57] really
[01:13:00] good TCG ranked is so fun in general
[01:13:03] yeah Legend hearstone player by the way
[01:13:05] no big deal no big deal no big top 100
[01:13:08] no big deal no big deal no big deal no
[01:13:11] big deal no big deal yeah it's no big
[01:13:16] deal back when it actually mattered not
[01:13:18] not any you know like years ago you know
[01:13:20] no no big
[01:13:21] deal not something you FL no yeah it is
[01:13:25] no no no I was a I was a skilled o wait
[01:13:28] this is almost
[01:13:34] done uh what was I going a level
[01:13:47] ciret yeah actually could be
[01:13:51] good hopefully we get CR rolls that's
[01:13:53] really good on the
[01:13:55] set okay we got a crit damage roll
[01:13:57] that's really good on the
[01:14:03] set
[01:14:05] yeah where's the music
[01:14:13] Sorry oh wait wait wait this could be
[01:14:16] good wait one more one more one more one
[01:14:17] more one more pause
[01:14:22] trap
[01:14:25] please oh that's a low roll but wait
[01:14:29] this is
[01:14:31] good this is like really good okay
[01:14:36] nice yeah some characters need crit
[01:14:38] damage cets on the set but provided I
[01:14:41] have I don't have too much CR rate this
[01:14:42] is really
[01:14:43] good
[01:14:48] nice yeah good damage nice all right I'm
[01:14:52] happy with that hey we're starting the
[01:14:54] day off strong we're starting someone
[01:14:56] typed Vermilion could never [ __ ] you I
[01:14:59] actually don't think I have a better
[01:15:00] Vermilion okay actually [ __ ] you by the
[01:15:02] way actually [ __ ] you wait let me see
[01:15:04] let me
[01:15:06] see
[01:15:09] uh uh
[01:15:11] Mar
[01:15:13] Vermilion let's see if I have a good a
[01:15:15] crit race circly better than that 14
[01:15:17] crit damage but
[01:15:20] no
[01:15:21] um no
[01:15:26] no ah
[01:15:29] [ __ ] yeah okay
[01:15:32] well melines Are Beautiful
[01:15:35] Creatures [ __ ] you chatter we have beef
[01:15:38] right now me and you they are the pride
[01:15:40] of
[01:15:45] fting be
[01:15:52] sure
[01:15:56] oh yeah also what I don't like the one
[01:15:57] thing I don't like about okay I think
[01:15:59] TCG has a lot of fun stuff like
[01:16:00] potential the one and I I like card

[01:16:04] like oh yeah by speaking of which
[01:16:05] whenever the [ __ ] Bazaar comes out
[01:16:07] I'm playing that but uh the one thing I
[01:16:09] didn't like is like every time I think

[01:16:13] I've won all eight and it always or like
[01:16:16] 10 I don't know and it always feels like
[01:16:17] I'm playing against like some like new
[01:16:20] person who doesn't know what the cards
[01:16:22] do like I feel bad I feel like an
[01:16:23] [ __ ] like I I I'm not trying to like

[01:21:07] actually D we need more evil characters
[01:21:10] like I'm saying like I said this before
[01:21:12] I'm going to say it again we need like
[01:21:13] characters that are like not redeemable
[01:21:16] at all like not morally gray just
[01:21:18] morally black like just like actually
[01:21:20] Bad characters like like more like like
[01:21:23] give me the té but like let me play him
[01:21:25] like I look I'm not he's not a good guy

[01:21:36] could be like hey hope you die [ __ ] you
[01:21:39] dor that wouldn't happen but you
[01:21:49] know people hate Sparkle but SF for doré
[01:21:53] uh I think well okay I'm not going to
[01:21:55] speak for people cuz there's a lot of
[01:21:56] dumb asses on the internet but I think
[01:21:58] the the my
[01:22:01] optimal my way of viewing it is like you
[01:22:05] can like the character just don't be
[01:22:06] like H you know I forgive them or like
[01:22:08] well okay I forgive them is like usually
[01:22:10] a meme but like don't be like yeah like
[01:22:13] you know what they did is cool like I'm
[01:22:14] so glad that [ __ ] dor is evil but
[01:22:17] like you can like the like they could be
[01:22:18] a well-written character most of Game of
[01:22:20] Thrones like a lot of it is like
[01:22:22] characters are [ __ ] but like it's cool
[01:22:24] to like like they're cool
[01:22:26] characters like there's a lot of like
[01:22:28] just actually bad people but like it's
[01:22:30] cool they're cool they're not like I
[01:22:32] don't know how to describe this it's
[01:22:33] like good writing but it doesn't mean
[01:22:35] you're like for like um it does like you
[01:22:38] want to see them die like okay slight
[01:22:41] spoilers actually I'm going to try not
[01:22:43] to spoil this but like the whole time
[01:22:45] you're watching it you hope [ __ ]
[01:22:46] Cersei dies you're like I can't wait to
[01:22:48] [ __ ] see her die cuz she's so evil
[01:22:50] you're like I want her to just actually
[01:22:52] just die but like it's part of the
[01:22:54] reason that like you're you keep
[01:22:56] watching
[01:22:57] right but you can also like you can like
[01:23:00] the character like your favorite
[01:23:01] character can be an evil character but
[01:23:02] it's it's it's not like you're like
[01:23:04] saying yeah like I love what they
[01:23:06] did but like you need a lot some
[01:23:09] characters just need to be evil or like
[01:23:11] what the [ __ ] is the point like you're
[01:23:12] not going to be like you
[01:23:15] know yeah don't like condone their
[01:23:18] actions but like liking the character is
[01:23:20] fine like I like the tor's design a lot
[01:23:22] but he's a [ __ ] psychopath I hope
[01:23:24] Cole [ __ ] kills him like genuinely
[01:23:27] but I still want to play him I still
[01:23:29] think he looks sick I think the manga
[01:23:31] one is a visually a lot cooler no [ __ ]
[01:23:33] yeah this is the most like vanilla take
[01:23:35] like I feel like it's very neutral but I
[01:23:37] don't
[01:23:39] know yeah Joffrey was the biggest
[01:23:42] [ __ ]
[01:23:51] [ __ ] people can't handle mean
[01:23:53] characters
[01:23:58] yeah that's what it
[01:24:04] is I mean I also agreed with like one
[01:24:07] thing that's like to the opposite of
[01:24:09] what I'm saying
[01:24:11] where like if someone points out bad
[01:24:13] [ __ ] someone did people will like start
[01:24:15] hating on them when they're like hey
[01:24:16] it's just like bad [ __ ] they did like
[01:24:18] that's fine like you know you're allowed
[01:24:20] to not like a character like you don't
[01:24:21] have like I'm not saying like okay
[01:24:22] character's bad so everyone has to like
[01:24:24] like everyone has to like them it's like
[01:24:25] you can hate a character you can like a
[01:24:26] character but it's just like I don't
[01:24:28] like the
[01:24:31] um I don't like the people that not the
[01:24:33] people but I don't like the take that
[01:24:35] some people have where it's like liking
[01:24:37] a bad character means you're like
[01:24:39] condoning their actions obviously like
[01:24:40] no one says
[01:24:42] that although some people do but like
[01:24:45] that's not the you know the
[01:24:48] point do you watch House of the Dragon
[01:24:50] no I didn't I heard it was good when it
[01:24:51] was airing but I haven't heard anyone
[01:24:53] talk about it anymore anymore uh like in

[01:25:13] going to get stronger and then the
[01:25:14] villain's like a [ __ ] like I don't

[01:34:45] like no one there's no actual name for a

[01:36:08] I have two coffees they look the
[01:36:11] same is this the old one or the new
[01:36:16] one I think this is the new
[01:36:18] one maybe you just have to be grateful
[01:36:20] thank you for the crit
[01:36:24] damage
[01:36:26] yo thank you for the crit damage I
[01:36:30] really appreciate
[01:36:32] it okay okay thank you thank you I'm a
[01:36:35] grateful man I'm a grateful
[01:36:47] man why do I have this oh it's my best
[01:36:50] ER attack Goblin
[01:36:56] but I'm not I
[01:37:00] mean Shen
[01:37:08] Yun let's
[01:37:11] roll thank you so much artifact gods for
[01:37:16] the crit damage I am
[01:37:20] grateful
[01:37:22] that's fine that's fine I have a lot of
[01:37:24] feathers that rolled only attack on the
[01:37:26] set which is why I'm not looking for
[01:37:28] more but it's still not a bad rooll if
[01:37:31] we get crit damage here I will lament I
[01:37:34] promise I will lament
[01:37:39] everywhere please please please please
[01:37:41] please please
[01:37:43] please this is still good this is still
[01:37:46] good this is still good that's a good
[01:37:49] past that's a lot of attack but it's a
[01:37:50] good Beast
[01:37:51] it's good it's good it's good it's not
[01:37:55] omega low it is poggers it's good
[01:37:59] Optimizer p is
[01:38:01] true yeah it's good it's really good um
[01:38:07] so the only reason that this moment
[01:38:09] isn't as
[01:38:11] exciting as it would be right is only
[01:38:14] because I have
[01:38:17] um this piece which looks very similar
[01:38:20] it has one more roll for one less crit
[01:38:22] damage roll but uh it has ER as well so
[01:38:25] they're pretty similar also I think this
[01:38:28] one's better though if you don't need
[01:38:29] the ER a lot of people on the set don't
[01:38:30] need the ER so this one's like I would
[01:38:31] say on average better
[01:38:35] however
[01:38:38] a should is like 700 roll value this
[01:38:41] thing is insane the only reason is
[01:38:44] because I have a lot of feathers that
[01:38:45] are similar and feathers are the only
[01:38:48] piece on MAR CH I have that are good and
[01:38:50] I have this
[01:38:52] now
[01:38:53] look this is my best one of my best
[01:38:56] feathers of all time it's okay I need
[01:38:58] good feathers on a lot of characters but
[01:39:00] and here's the big butt this is like
[01:39:02] this is a big butt
[01:39:05] right this like this is like rizzly it's
[01:39:07] like calfa the the main thing here the
[01:39:09] butt here is uh look at my Sans this is
[01:39:12] my best Sans this is my best
[01:39:16] Sans and I have feathers that are like
[01:39:19] this quality
[01:39:21] and I also don't have a goblet for a lot
[01:39:23] of my characters I have a good pyro one
[01:39:25] I have a good go one hydro's okay but
[01:39:30] um I could like use like I like I almost
[01:39:34] have a good four piece on
[01:39:36] MAR but I don't
[01:39:41] yet wait chat what do you think about sh
[01:39:45] no I I need to Onset sand I can't even
[01:39:47] do it yet cuz my Sans is um I don't have
[01:39:49] an attack one like it's only this you
[01:39:51] think I have one maybe I have one what
[01:39:53] if I have one that I never
[01:39:56] rolled oh
[01:39:59] W yeah I don't have one maybe a goblet
[01:40:02] an emo goblet 100 gifted if I have a
[01:40:04] double crit emo
[01:40:09] goblet okay one more run one more run
[01:40:12] that was a good feather though I'm happy
[01:40:13] about
[01:40:15] it
[01:40:19] silence
[01:40:21] minus
[01:40:25] 100K do you only roll double crit Sands
[01:40:28] no I would like my dude my alyam
[01:40:34] Sands never mind this actually pretty
[01:40:36] good okay my on set one on set for
[01:40:38] gilded I still don't have
[01:40:40] one uh by the way I got like seven hyper
[01:40:43] Bloom sets before I got one good attack
[01:40:45] sand so uh take that hyper Bloom deniers
[01:40:47] but my like like this one okay this one
[01:40:50] has double crit but it's like dog [ __ ]
[01:40:53] um this was my best one for the longest
[01:40:54] time it only has one crit stat but it's
[01:40:56] like it's
[01:41:01] okay I don't need both of these [ __ ]
[01:41:03] this
[01:41:05] one I did a dude I did like two flop
[01:41:08] runs off stream I got nothing I got an
[01:41:10] em sand and an em goblet but on the
[01:41:11] wrong set so I actually got uh incident
[01:41:15] wait how do I remove this com
[01:41:19] back
[01:41:22] be
[01:41:23] Sanctified rent free Hyper rent
[01:41:29] free is an attack better than crit for
[01:41:33] what for
[01:41:43] Alam it's going be
[01:41:49] good
[01:41:51] you think you're going to make another
[01:41:52] sh guide yes I plan on making a sh guide
[01:41:55] for his rerun change the song yeah sorry
[01:41:59] it is a little
[01:42:01] cringe
[01:42:03] uh I do want to make one for the rerun
[01:42:06] I'll see if I do or not cuz it's going
[01:42:07] to take a while but I do want to cuz the
[01:42:09] teams changed a lot I could make it just
[01:42:11] on teams cuz I feel like the other part
[01:42:13] of the video no wait there's like new
[01:42:14] sets now never mind I have to make a
[01:42:16] full one there's also new weapons God
[01:42:18] [ __ ] damn it okay I guess I'll make a
[01:42:19] full new one
[01:42:28] like don't get me wrong I love talking
[01:42:29] about Shia but it's it's it's so much
[01:42:32] yapping cuz I'm going to have to like
[01:42:34] it's so much
[01:42:40] yapping cuz he has like eight different
[01:42:43] sets
[01:42:44] dude an oversight on my
[01:42:49] part
[01:42:52] and the the problem with Shia is like I
[01:42:54] wouldn't recommend like I have a dilemma
[01:42:57] right where on one hand yeah Mar is good
[01:43:00] for Hut on field with uh finina on one
[01:43:03] hand I don't want to recommend Vermilion
[01:43:06] because marish is easy to farm but on
[01:43:07] the other hand I want to defend
[01:43:09] Vermillion as being the best set when it
[01:43:11] you it technically is most of the time
[01:43:15] not
[01:43:16] always because one I spent so much resin
[01:43:19] on it and two at very very high
[01:43:21] investment it it is with an asterisk
[01:43:24] sometimes it isn't if you're running
[01:43:26] like a crit damage weapon with a Shan
[01:43:27] Yun you could go Mar right uh uh without
[01:43:30] that they're usually very similar in
[01:43:32] strength but you need like let's say
[01:43:34] you're not running a crit damage weapon
[01:43:35] you need to avoid every crit rate rule
[01:43:37] on M or you'll overcap with Shan yun's
[01:43:39] 10% crit rate uh also uh without shenyun
[01:43:43] then Vermillion is typically a little
[01:43:45] better but only like one substat and
[01:43:47] like there's a lot there's a lot of
[01:43:48] stuff okay and it's for most people you
[01:43:52] can just do Mar and not have to think
[01:43:54] about it but for the like turbo sha
[01:43:57] lovers who already Farm Vermillion
[01:43:59] Vermillion can still be better or for
[01:44:01] people that want a strongbox well you
[01:44:03] could still strong box Vermillion but do
[01:44:05] I recommend ever setting foot in that
[01:44:07] [ __ ] domain
[01:44:12] no you assume 10% I assume four well the
[01:44:16] thing is crit is just okay I don't give
[01:44:18] a [ __ ] what your Optimizer tells you
[01:44:20] crit past okay oops crit past 92%
[01:44:24] especially if you're with shenyun and
[01:44:25] only getting 4% crit rate like that's
[01:44:27] what you're assuming is so much worse
[01:44:29] like I don't care I don't care if your
[01:44:31] offer tells you you want 100 crit 90
[01:44:33] like you're there's the odds of you
[01:44:35] either getting an 8% crit rate Abyss
[01:44:37] card or Shan Yun giving you more than 4%
[01:44:39] crit rate are higher than like I don't
[01:44:42] know you don't need I don't know like
[01:44:45] I'm a very high crit rate Andy like I'm
[01:44:47] not okay never mind sure surely surely a
[01:44:53] okay yes most usually I do build a lot
[01:44:56] of crit rate okay I am a crit rate uh
[01:44:59] person but like usually past
[01:45:05] 92 usually past 92 like you could chill
[01:45:10] them we don't always play Abyss little
[01:45:12] bro okay then what are you optim are you
[01:45:15] optimizing past 92 crit raid for
[01:45:18] Overworld exploration
[01:45:24] yes okay all good then you keep going
[01:45:27] keep it
[01:45:34] up it doesn't really matter though like
[01:45:36] I you
[01:45:38] know that's an argument that like in
[01:45:41] reality won't really matter like it
[01:45:42] doesn't matter if you're 92 or 98 crate
[01:45:48] like yeah
[01:45:51] like at that point you're clearing the
[01:45:52] abyss right like unless you have no crit
[01:45:53] damage like at that point you're
[01:46:00] like Let The Mighty be
[01:46:03] humble for attack C with shenan with
[01:46:05] finina attack you don't need more
[01:46:07] healing like you have enough with the
[01:46:16] attack you react to the E clipse yet I
[01:46:18] think we are about to do that
[01:46:22] successfully oh wait that's the second
[01:46:24] is this Deja Vu someone [ __ ] pinched
[01:46:26] me this is the second one we
[01:46:30] got it looks the it's like the same
[01:46:34] stats what if it rolls the
[01:46:42] same go all in bro says Gambit gamble
[01:46:46] dude your name is literally a red flag
[01:46:48] like you're telling me you're a [ __ ]
[01:46:50] you're a gambling addict I look I hope
[01:46:53] you get better but like why are you
[01:46:54] projecting that onto me why are you
[01:46:56] forcing that lifestyle onto
[01:47:09] me this music is so
[01:47:12] angry it is but it's good my last sub
[01:47:16] until I got a new job farming villion
[01:47:19] thanks for the
[01:47:21] 10
[01:47:30] months wait this like literally wait
[01:47:33] what this is like rolling the same as
[01:47:35] the last piece what the
[01:47:41] [ __ ] okay H yeah it's
[01:47:49] okay
[01:47:53] it's
[01:47:55] okay are you an angry person listening
[01:47:57] to metal doesn't make you an angry
[01:47:59] person in fact there's studies that show
[01:48:00] the opposite I've seen a lot of people
[01:48:02] listening to their happy [ __ ] lovey
[01:48:04] doy pop [ __ ] or K-pop [ __ ] and be the
[01:48:07] viest people on Twitter that not all of
[01:48:09] them look there's a lot I listen to
[01:48:11] K-pop but like I'm just saying it's not
[01:48:13] the type of music you listen to that
[01:48:14] shapes how you act
[01:48:19] true
[01:48:24] metal is therapeutic that's how I get my
[01:48:27] anger
[01:48:36] out he is no I'm not Fang but
[01:48:40] hi dude I had so much Riz last time wait
[01:48:44] yo someone pull up the glitter VOD I
[01:48:46] actually yo raid my Riz chat did someone
[01:48:49] clip it probably not
[01:48:51] become my favor CC even if it hasn't
[01:48:53] been long
[01:48:54] smile yours often but every time I watch
[01:48:58] a clip or a v i always but if we learned
[01:49:00] anything from the whole genin
[01:49:03] PVP uh two things one there's no content
[01:49:07] so everyone has to fight each other two
[01:49:08] don't get attached to your content
[01:49:10] creators you don't know them they're not
[01:49:11] your friends I'm not your friend I try
[01:49:13] to be a good person but you
[01:49:16] know uh
[01:49:19] okay
[01:49:23] capital D
[01:49:24] colon sorry
[01:49:27] [ __ ] I thought you were
[01:49:34] special I'm sorry you're not my
[01:49:40] friend what are we zock
[01:49:48] dude hey where is this Mr socks I spent
[01:49:51] my soul on Vermillion and have a
[01:49:54] 9235 ratio is Vermillion still b in
[01:49:59] a
[01:50:01] team solitary Crow I just kind of talked
[01:50:03] about it for you yes it is never ever
[01:50:08] okay I have to say this right now to any
[01:50:11] shamain watching this is like the most
[01:50:13] important life tip if you have a good
[01:50:15] Vermillion or you have a good Mari don't
[01:50:17] switch ever no matter what I don't give
[01:50:19] a [ __ ] if you get convinced that like
[01:50:21] one set is a bit better I don't care
[01:50:24] whatever you farm use it on Shia he
[01:50:26] loves you you love him you're good okay
[01:50:29] okay it's like a it's literally like one
[01:50:32] sub that different like M say could be
[01:50:34] better if you dodge crit rate all the
[01:50:35] time but like shenu gives you crit and
[01:50:37] then you might have a crit weapon and
[01:50:38] then you have crit ension and then if
[01:50:40] you don't it's like vermillion's better
[01:50:41] and then in other teams vermillion's
[01:50:42] better but it's like one subside better
[01:50:44] sometimes it's not even better so it's
[01:50:46] like very close like just you know I
[01:50:48] recommend farming say domain but you can
[01:50:51] strongbox Vermilion if you want uh just
[01:50:53] don't do the the Vermilion domain itself
[01:50:55] usually sucks that's the main thing cuz

[02:01:45] on HP so that's strike one um Soo is Ben
[02:01:50] clearly Singo also looks
[02:01:53] unused that's
[02:01:55] fine you have bet it in a [ __ ] what
[02:01:58] the [ __ ] is this
[02:02:01] team are you normal attacking on [ __ ]
[02:02:06] SAR you don't even have you can't even
[02:02:09] Quicken what reaction are you are you
[02:02:13] burgeoning no please say this is a fake
[02:02:15] team oh my God you actually launched it
[02:02:20] what the [ __ ] is this
[02:02:21] team yo yo okay play what you want no
[02:02:27] disrespect but this is not Shang Ling
[02:02:30] bro you're not vaping what what reaction
[02:02:33] are you proing
[02:02:35] bloom all right let's watch this also I
[02:02:38] think this is the last Abyss which had
[02:02:39] the hydro toopa and stuff so I think
[02:02:41] it's the abyss right before this one
[02:02:42] okay
[02:02:43] 121 we'll skip through it but I'll let
[02:02:46] you like start okay let's see your
[02:02:48] rotation this team also this team could
[02:02:50] work cuz Fin and ficial are broken
[02:02:53] umid but you really have a hyper Bloomer
[02:02:55] here time to shine okay say
[02:03:03] cheese here
[02:03:05] please bro you're doing physical normal
[02:03:08] attacks you okay okay first things first
[02:03:12] if you're GNA if you don't have anyone
[02:03:14] to normal attack on at least stay inside
[02:03:16] of your kirara's box so you can apply
[02:03:18] dendro that's one number two you can at
[02:03:20] least Auto attack on Charlotte to apply
[02:03:22] cryo if you need to cuz she's the
[02:03:24] Catalyst but
[02:03:29] what wait your D is doing 40K okay this
[02:03:32] has to be
[02:03:34] bait description okay there's
[02:03:37] nothing they have super conduct wait are
[02:03:40] no but you can't be physical you're
[02:03:42] bursted
[02:03:43] 40K this there's no way this you're
[02:03:45] doing
[02:03:47] 800 how is that better than applying
[02:03:49] more
[02:03:53] element okay I
[02:03:57] mean
[02:03:59] now um I kind of regret clicking on this
[02:04:04] video Let's see the second half let's
[02:04:06] see the second
[02:04:08] half okay first half is taking you 3
[02:04:10] minutes so this has to be okay let's get
[02:04:13] a second half
[02:04:16] okay okay bet it all so usually you
[02:04:19] don't want to waste Bennett whoa okay
[02:04:21] yolan alting first of all yolon scales
[02:04:23] on HP not attack but uh using your
[02:04:26] Bennett Al at the start of your rotation
[02:04:27] is almost always bad you want to use it
[02:04:29] before your DPS well okay if you're
[02:04:31] support snapshot you want to but if you
[02:04:34] have like Jong Lee shield first if you
[02:04:35] have yon you could use her burst first
[02:04:37] you don't want to lose Ben it'ss uptime
[02:04:39] so using his burst here right now is is
[02:04:42] quite bad
[02:04:46] stabilize bro let's ni this that in the
[02:04:49] butt can't see a you haven't fired a
[02:04:57] yon
[02:04:59] bro let's do an interesting experiment
[02:05:01] let's count how many times yolon fired
[02:05:04] her burst let's count let's count how
[02:05:06] many times her her dice shot some rain
[02:05:08] arrows let's
[02:05:10] count okay
[02:05:13] so you use your yum burst here about to
[02:05:16] get okay that is one right there nice
[02:05:19] you got one two swwa her to Auto attack
[02:05:22] got a third one off now you go to Big T
[02:05:26] no normal attack still no normal attack
[02:05:27] you fire one more four no normal attack
[02:05:30] one more one more and now it's
[02:05:34] over six uh let's see how fast you
[02:05:38] clear 6 minutes 5
[02:05:47] minutes
[02:05:50] I just started playing in 4.0 I lost
[02:05:52] every single 50/50 could have made a
[02:05:53] better team but the attack scaling
[02:05:54] characters share the same Sands and
[02:05:56] sometimes goblet sagge 98% of the Sands
[02:05:58] are HP also my fina's on attack percent
[02:06:00] because
[02:06:04] I'm okay please listen to me please this
[02:06:07] looks like someone who actually needs
[02:06:08] advice so I'll stop roasting you and
[02:06:09] I'll give you productive advice first of
[02:06:11] all sub stats no [ __ ] [ __ ] stats main
[02:06:14] stats matter more than your set okay
[02:06:17] let's look at what finina can do with
[02:06:19] attack percent let's no no no no no
[02:06:21] let's look together let's look at what
[02:06:23] finina can do with attack percent so if
[02:06:26] you look at Sal HP HP HP so there's no
[02:06:30] attack uh burst HP so the only thing
[02:06:35] attack Buffs is your normal
[02:06:37] attacks because of this an HP S would
[02:06:41] actually be a lot better than a set
[02:06:42] effect imagine if your set was 46% HP be
[02:06:46] a pretty good set right
[02:06:49] but on top of that you could go like
[02:06:50] twopiece twopiece you don't fully lose
[02:06:52] out on your set you could do like
[02:06:52] twopiece golden twopiece something else
[02:06:54] and eventually you'll get an HP golden
[02:06:56] uh Sands or you could use an off piece
[02:06:58] one now that's number one number you can
[02:07:00] also use ER actually I forgot to mention
[02:07:02] this ER sand is also good on Fino just
[02:07:04] you Pro like you assuming you're running
[02:07:06] the team that you're running you need a
[02:07:07] lot of ER on her that's one number two
[02:07:10] is that your justification for your team
[02:07:14] is like I don't have attack sance well
[02:07:15] okay if you want to run an attack
[02:07:17] character scaling character you don't
[02:07:18] have a attack Sands you have a few
[02:07:19] options some of them can run again like
[02:07:21] an ER sand or you can go on offset Sands
[02:07:23] or you can just change the set you're
[02:07:25] running let's say first of all I don't
[02:07:27] know why you're not playing Hut but
[02:07:28] let's say you're like okay I can't play
[02:07:29] SRO cuz I don't have a good attack sand
[02:07:31] you could one either go ER Sands if you
[02:07:33] don't have something like sax or or
[02:07:34] whatever or
[02:07:36] two just say [ __ ] your set well emblem's
[02:07:39] good on SRO but like for a lot of
[02:07:41] characters there's another set that's
[02:07:43] viable too I guess s Cho is a bad
[02:07:44] example uh Team recommendation wise if
[02:07:48] you want want me to help you out I think
[02:07:50] first of all never play Big T without
[02:07:51] aggravate please or spread please so run
[02:07:54] tanari with a Electro like fishal or Yi
[02:07:59] uh that's one two I would recommend
[02:08:01] playing a Hut team also you need a
[02:08:02] normal attacker like if you're playing
[02:08:03] Yan you want some who normal attacks you
[02:08:05] can technically weave it in with Big T
[02:08:06] but I don't really recommend it and then
[02:08:08] for your first team you have literally
[02:08:09] no one who can normal attack uh and you
[02:08:11] don't need a Healer well you need a
[02:08:12] Healer with um finina but if you have
[02:08:15] Kirara like usually Kirara is used
[02:08:17] instead of a Healer but with finina you
[02:08:18] don't need like you need a Healer not a
[02:08:20] shielder so I would like change the team
[02:08:22] up I personally would recommend huta
[02:08:25] with probably double Hydro I would do
[02:08:27] like cuta yolan Farid that's an amazing
[02:08:29] team last L could be a Healer um
[02:08:32] literally any healer for the most part
[02:08:34] uh Gan and Bennett are
[02:08:36] good but most healers can
[02:08:40] work um and then for your other team I'd
[02:08:43] probably
[02:08:44] run you could play to but run them with
[02:08:46] like Fishel I would do Big T Fishel
[02:08:49] Jong Lee and then last lot Flex you
[02:08:51] could either do double dendro double
[02:08:53] Electro I like double Electro I can't
[02:08:55] see all your characters
[02:09:00] um you can also play
[02:09:04] kaching actually you could just do Jang
[02:09:06] Lee you could do Big T jeang Lee fishal
[02:09:09] and then
[02:09:10] like Kookie no but Kookie kind of suckss
[02:09:13] if you don't need a Healer so I guess
[02:09:15] your last thought would depend on the
[02:09:16] other characters you have I think you'd
[02:09:17] have to level someone I don't know if
[02:09:18] you show your characters
[02:09:23] though kaching against Electro well the
[02:09:25] abyss change now so the team
[02:09:26] recommendation is a bit different but
[02:09:28] you would you would run kaching um
[02:09:30] kaching or first half not second
[02:09:32] probably like if the the team is bad
[02:09:34] second half and then you could do Hut or
[02:09:37] whatever um let me look at your
[02:09:39] characters before I start yapping okay I
[02:09:42] guess you don't really show
[02:09:45] it anyways I maybe I should stop y
[02:09:49] let me look at some more
[02:09:54] gameplay iar everything like you're
[02:09:57] literally blooming like you're blooming
[02:09:59] but there's nothing to frog blooms
[02:10:00] except Bennett skill so there's a bunch
[02:10:02] of cores that just Bloom and generally
[02:10:03] Bloom without nuu or hyper blo or like a
[02:10:06] consistent virger is not that
[02:10:09] great like it shouldn't take you this
[02:10:11] long to kill the the slimes this guy got
[02:10:13] his shield back okay uh highly recommend
[02:10:17] changing your team up not your fault if
[02:10:19] you get unlucky or you know don't have
[02:10:20] every character that's fine but I
[02:10:22] recommend at least building from the
[02:10:24] characters I could see you do a Hut team
[02:10:26] with double hydro and then either tar or
[02:10:28] kaching or Soo depending on the other
[02:10:30] supports you have FAL is good in like
[02:10:32] all those teams if you're hyper bling
[02:10:34] with like s you could put like Kookie
[02:10:35] with a hydro and drro with s you could
[02:10:37] do uh Big T fishal and then either
[02:10:39] Kookie or Jong Lee and then a flex slot
[02:10:41] that's either another Electro or dendro
[02:10:43] again I can't see your full character
[02:10:44] list but something like that would work
[02:10:46] even with kaching like a good almost
[02:10:47] freeo playay team is like kaching FAL
[02:10:50] Cole or dendro MC and then like
[02:10:52] literally Barbara can work and you get
[02:10:54] like some bonus hyper blooms um or you
[02:10:57] could do ideally you have a dental
[02:10:59] healer there or you could do like like
[02:11:01] basically an anemo character so you do
[02:11:02] like sucrose kaching FAL and then a
[02:11:04] dendro um if you need a Healer be Yao ya
[02:11:06] or Kirara who you have and if not you
[02:11:09] could do an offensive
[02:11:12] one no Shang langing Shang langing works
[02:11:15] too but like you're not going to force
[02:11:16] someone to play Shang langing if they
[02:11:17] didn't Shang Ling right that's why I
[02:11:19] didn't mention her but if you want like
[02:11:21] a Shang Ling team could be really good
[02:11:22] too in this Abyss there's the hydro
[02:11:24] talpa so like one of your best teams
[02:11:26] would be Hut with Shang Ling right that
[02:11:28] team would be insane like you don't even
[02:11:29] need like the other two characters are
[02:11:31] nice but they're not even they're almost
[02:11:32] not even needed there but you could do
[02:11:35] like finina Bennett
[02:11:38] right but yeah okay next one I hope I
[02:11:43] helped
[02:11:45] KNX you're 36 star so I probably don't
[02:11:47] need to do do this but I want to show
[02:11:49] guys my DPS
[02:11:57] cave what the [ __ ] is
[02:12:02] this bro gearing
[02:12:07] is okay uh your BYU has 66 crit rate
[02:12:10] what am I looking
[02:12:12] at are you playing on an iPad that's
[02:12:14] that's kind of
[02:12:16] based um you said DPS cave where is
[02:12:19] he this is not
[02:12:22] cave I have been lied to I am
[02:12:25] disappointed but not
[02:12:28] surprised sorry I'm trying to find a
[02:12:31] someone that actually needs help 33
[02:12:33] finina DPS I just got Ryden don't judge
[02:12:36] me wait you just got Ryden and you're
[02:12:38] ready playing your hyper
[02:12:40] Bloom usually Ryden hyper Bloom is
[02:12:43] reserved for people who like got Ryden
[02:12:44] two years ago and are now bored of her
[02:12:47] okay let's go your
[02:12:48] doing outes your okay right hyper this
[02:12:52] so far this is so
[02:12:54] good
[02:12:57] um ah
[02:13:00] okay fun fact in a Ryden hyper Bloom
[02:13:03] team you're not Auto attacking on Ryden
[02:13:06] you have another character to Auto
[02:13:08] attack on so if you're building full em
[02:13:10] even if you're bursting you don't do
[02:13:12] that much damage on Ryden so you want to
[02:13:14] be Auto attacking on Nita for the most
[02:13:16] part or like
[02:13:18] or someone else also as someone in chat
[02:13:21] pointed
[02:13:22] out why the [ __ ] is cie here if you're
[02:13:27] calm down if you're hyper bloing on
[02:13:29] Ryden what's the point of
[02:13:32] Kookie at that point bench ryen go like
[02:13:36] Ayo or
[02:13:39] Y I'll settle this cuz at this point
[02:13:42] Ryden and CI do the exact same thing so
[02:13:44] like you could literally I guarantee you
[02:13:46] go try this you could remove one of
[02:13:48] these two characters from the team play
[02:13:50] a three character comp and you're going
[02:13:52] to clear like just as fast now people
[02:13:55] saying it's quick Bloom it's not because
[02:13:58] to Ryden bursted 35k damage which means
[02:14:01] you're either on full em or your ar26
[02:14:05] those are the only two
[02:14:13] options probably just for healing well
[02:14:15] at that point cool but Auto attack on
[02:14:17] Nita you want more dendro at that point
[02:14:20] and Nita's scalings like they're fine
[02:14:22] like Nita's going to do okay damage
[02:14:23] Temple
[02:14:26] of this although you'd probably want
[02:14:28] double Hydro for like high dendro High
[02:14:31] hydro and then Ryden Electro gives you
[02:14:33] value but I mean you still cleared in
[02:14:35] time so never mind
[02:14:38] actually
[02:14:41] bro wait how much are you hyper goinging
[02:14:43] for the Temple
[02:14:45] of bond is Oh I thought this is a 36
[02:14:48] star clear I forgot this isn't oh my God
[02:14:51] you're level
[02:14:52] 80 wait level your wait okay a lot of
[02:14:56] characters first of all this quality
[02:14:58] unlucky but it's fine a lot of
[02:15:00] characters don't need to be level 90
[02:15:01] okay but if you're hyper bloing procing
[02:15:04] a transformative reaction you really
[02:15:06] want to be level 90 because it's a huge
[02:15:08] DPS increase it can be like up to 30%
[02:15:10] more damage like 34 I think for Bloom
[02:15:12] from 80 to 90 on the character that is
[02:15:14] hyper blooming so for Ryden or kie I
[02:15:17] don't I didn't see your cookie level you
[02:15:19] really want to be
[02:15:23] 90 s you can keep it 80 though it's fine
[02:15:26] but yeah ki's 80 as well so your Hy are
[02:15:28] doing way less damage that's something
[02:15:30] that's so easily solvable all you need
[02:15:32] is XP
[02:15:33] books and um they said they got her
[02:15:36] recently okay then guess what level 90
[02:15:39] Kookie bench Ryden play Hydro character
[02:15:42] now if you're like okay I want to play
[02:15:43] Ryden that's fine bench cookie add maybe
[02:15:45] another um any character it's it's not a
[02:15:48] crit Ryden it's not look I'll guarantee
[02:15:49] I guarantee you if it's a crit Ryden I
[02:15:51] will gift you a house I will [ __ ] buy
[02:15:54] you I will spend I will sell my entire
[02:15:57] Twitch
[02:15:59] account wait Ry was on the
[02:16:02] catch wait your catch
[02:16:10] H I take back everything I
[02:16:16] said
[02:16:20] bro
[02:16:24] you're please refine the catch
[02:16:27] please please like I get it fishing
[02:16:30] sucks but if you're going to use the
[02:16:32] weapon please Rive it you literally
[02:16:34] double its effect it's it's so much
[02:16:39] better wait you're on
[02:16:42] two bro okay a lot of characters you can
[02:16:46] get away with just sub stats but but
[02:16:47] like four emblem on Ryden is so much
[02:16:50] damage it's actually like it's so
[02:16:55] much I
[02:16:59] mean okay I guess it is a crit
[02:17:02] ryen
[02:17:12] um
[02:17:15] okay I'm going to be very honest with
[02:17:17] you your team would clear faster if
[02:17:19] Ryden wasn't there like no disrespect to
[02:17:21] Ryden but like so Ryden is really good
[02:17:24] in this team but I'm just saying for you
[02:17:26] if you literally remove Ryden and add
[02:17:29] another like on Fielder like Ayo or even
[02:17:32] [ __ ] yolon you would actually clear
[02:17:34] much faster and then onfield Nita now
[02:17:36] another big red flag I noticed is your
[02:17:42] Nita unless you're [ __ ] sing chos on
[02:17:45] deepwood you are losing so much [ __ ]
[02:17:47] damage
[02:17:49] so please use deepwood memories hyper
[02:17:52] Bloom is dendro damage okay the reaction
[02:17:54] scales on dendro the only time you might
[02:17:56] not need uh deepwood is let's say you're
[02:17:58] playing aggravate right you're just
[02:18:00] using Electro carries kaching fishal
[02:18:02] your yo yo or Nik could be on like
[02:18:04] gilded or or instructor for Yao yaa
[02:18:06] right that's
[02:18:07] fine but for hyper Bloom you really need
[02:18:13] deepwood
[02:18:15] um ah
[02:18:23] seven
[02:18:28] yo I mean okay you have enough
[02:18:31] unironically wait why is your ciret
[02:18:41] [Applause]
[02:18:43] AGP okay uh two things one remember
[02:18:47] stats are more important than sets Okay
[02:18:49] Main stat more important than set effect
[02:18:53] the only exception is for like pure
[02:18:54] supports where you don't care about
[02:18:55] their damage you want stats main stats
[02:18:57] even sub stats a lot the times can be
[02:18:59] better than than set effects especially
[02:19:00] main stats that's one two for syro I
[02:19:04] will say I'll extend an all of Branch to
[02:19:05] you the base sro's value by just having
[02:19:09] enough ER and applying Hydro is still
[02:19:11] enough for you to clear if you have a
[02:19:13] good team okay it's still a start but
[02:19:15] please build crit like crit is just
[02:19:18] come on you have seven crit
[02:19:20] rate at least get a crit rate circit
[02:19:23] like you don't even need sub stats on it
[02:19:26] but it's okay uh for cookie that's look
[02:19:28] at your cookie
[02:19:30] two you have more crit on your cookie
[02:19:33] than
[02:19:34] Singo you have more crit on
[02:19:46] cookie does this look like [ __ ] NE
[02:19:49] sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry for
[02:19:50] yelling does this look like
[02:19:53] n is is this
[02:19:56] Neu I'm sorry please building cie I
[02:20:01] promise you is the easiest thing in the
[02:20:03] world okay I know people act like em is
[02:20:05] impossible to get I it's a hard main set
[02:20:06] to get I'll be fair but you can
[02:20:08] genuinely ignore sets for like well you
[02:20:11] want to do twopiece twopiece em if you
[02:20:13] don't have a good set but you can
[02:20:14] literally go here look at what I'm doing
[02:20:15] you click Elemental Mastery whatever
[02:20:17] ever your number one piece is you just
[02:20:18] click whatever it is okay now ideally
[02:20:21] you go for a set that Buffs hyper Guild
[02:20:22] of Dreams flower of Paradise Lost 2
[02:20:24] Beast Em 2bm Right guilded dreams
[02:20:26] wanders right that's fine but all you
[02:20:29] should do at like as a general idea for
[02:20:32] KI is just filter by em click on the
[02:20:34] piece equip it your flower and feather
[02:20:36] don't even need sub stats you just need

[02:20:59] pieces your Nita has
[02:21:03] 890m which is good by the like that's
[02:21:05] good but if you give these exact pieces
[02:21:08] to Kookie like your account isn't bad
[02:21:10] you just like these little tips and I
[02:21:12] promise you can clear the abyss you
[02:21:14] first of all Nita you could level but
[02:21:15] like Ascend at least but you give this
[02:21:17] A90 em to your cookie then you give Nita
[02:21:20] deepwood memories boom you
[02:21:23] clear and like you're on guilded on her
[02:21:26] right yeah so you you take this boom you
[02:21:27] give that to Kookie boom you give that
[02:21:29] to cie Boom you give that to Kookie boom
[02:21:34] you why okay okay it's okay it's okay

[02:21:47] okay on on
[02:21:49] like never mind you for for Nikita you
[02:21:51] really want either em or dendro on the
[02:21:53] go both are fine not
[02:21:57] HP uh this is fine though for cie
[02:22:01] like
[02:22:03] well honestly your em ciret is on
[02:22:06] wanders you could go another wanders you
[02:22:08] have two Beast two beast that's em em

[02:22:11] and then Nita you just want
[02:22:15] deep okay um
[02:22:18] also you have
[02:22:19] alham wait a
[02:22:22] second you have and
[02:22:25] Kaza you have so okay let me get this
[02:22:28] right you have alham but you're choosing
[02:22:31] to
[02:22:35] play you have ayam so I recommend you
[02:22:38] use him as an onfield DPS in this team
[02:22:40] it would be really good alham
[02:22:43] nah uh SRO and kuki is one of the
[02:22:46] strongest teams right
[02:22:48] very
[02:22:50] good a lot of your characters should be
[02:22:52] level like higher level though but or at
[02:22:54] least
[02:22:55] ascended um what was your second team I
[02:22:57] didn't even see your second team I
[02:22:58] almost had a heart attack okay finina so
[02:23:01] far so good we love finina G that's good
[02:23:04] what oh yeah you said finina DPS oh my
[02:23:07] god
[02:23:10] um I swear by my
[02:23:16] sword
[02:23:22] order guide
[02:23:25] you okay uh I love
[02:23:29] finina she's
[02:23:33] great but she can be a DPS without
[02:23:36] having to Auto attack let's say you
[02:23:38] really love finina right I love finina
[02:23:40] she can be your DPS from off field Melle
[02:23:43] cabala [ __ ] the other two that you
[02:23:45] summon right they actually do more when
[02:23:47] you're off field because of golden troop
[02:23:49] so if anything they do more off field so
[02:23:51] what I recommend you do in a team like
[02:23:53] this you already have some good
[02:23:54] characters frea G right you can just put
[02:23:58] anyone that could on field even like
[02:24:00] sucros if you want well you already have
[02:24:01] an anemo but like another let's say you
[02:24:03] want to do monoh Hydro you can you put
[02:24:05] like IO kakomi let me look at your
[02:24:06] character list um honestly you could do
[02:24:09] like Shia farzon but I'm not going to sh
[02:24:12] main propaganda you where's your
[02:24:13] character
[02:24:16] list
[02:24:21] yeah you can also do Ryden actually I I
[02:24:23] forgot you want like yeah let's say
[02:24:25] assuming you just pulled for Ryden I
[02:24:26] assume you want to play Ryden right so
[02:24:28] let me give you a team for Ryden you do
[02:24:29] Ryden finina Jean and then like I want
[02:24:32] to say Bennett but am I forgetting
[02:24:34] someone I think I used saw her on that
[02:24:35] team well that's rden Sunfire that
[02:24:37] actually works you can do R in Sunfire
[02:24:38] if you want uh you can also do rden
[02:24:41] finina Bennett and then Flex like
[02:24:44] literally any character in the game uh
[02:24:46] Kazo is really good good cuz you can um
[02:24:49] swirl Electro and hydro you could do
[02:24:52] double Electro you could put like Sara
[02:24:54] or official but or Shang Ling if you
[02:24:57] want do like rational but for the most
[02:24:59] part like the team you had let's say you
[02:25:01] want to play fre a Jee you could
[02:25:02] literally slap an onfield DPS like Ryden
[02:25:04] and then maybe Ben it to Sunfire your
[02:25:06] Jee and buff your Ryden if you don't
[02:25:08] know what Sunfire is it's like the pyrro
[02:25:09] swirl that Jee can get uh with
[02:25:12] Bennett
[02:25:14] but um yeah I'm trying to see what other
[02:25:18] DPSS you have you showed it at some

[02:31:40] s's going to get it boom see what did I
[02:31:42] [ __ ] tell you what did Z tell you
[02:31:44] exactly listen when I speak I'm sorry
[02:31:46] but yeah so you all you need to do is
[02:31:48] just SN your rain sword and you would
[02:31:49] have cleared that a lot
[02:31:50] faster anyways second
[02:31:53] half o mono Hydra I like this team wait
[02:31:56] yeah with Gan I actually like this team
[02:31:59] uh the only problem is you're running
[02:32:01] two healers I would if you I don't know
[02:32:03] what characters you have uh also I don't
[02:32:05] know why your fin is on life support but
[02:32:07] if you do have the luxury of more
[02:32:09] characters I would recommend either
[02:32:10] kokomi with your enimo being kazua who's
[02:32:13] on your other half
[02:32:15] or
[02:32:22] what was it going to say yeah yolan or
[02:32:26] ayato or like nette instead of kakomi
[02:32:28] with Jean as your healer I I lagged for
[02:32:30] a bit I forgot
[02:32:33] yeah wait that was really cute is that
[02:32:35] her [ __ ] voice
[02:32:40] SL okay that's pretty
[02:32:45] cute
[02:32:51] this is fine though I
[02:32:54] mean yeah like this team is hard to mess
[02:32:56] up with I'd be surprised the only thing
[02:32:58] you want to make sure you're doing is
[02:32:59] swirling Hydro but like do you do that
[02:33:01] you could swirl Hydro against a thunder
[02:33:02] man if by the way you got an achievement
[02:33:05] wait wait did you s Hydro let's
[02:33:08] see it's pretty hard not to even with
[02:33:10] like with finina you'll like swirl Hydra
[02:33:12] accidentally so I I assume you
[02:33:14] do okay basic attacking on your lawn
[02:33:17] yeah you SW Hydro that's
[02:33:19] fine
[02:33:21] okay yeah I mean it's
[02:33:30] fine uh your K shouldn't be on full crit
[02:33:32] though em is definitely better
[02:33:35] but
[02:33:40] yeah it's fine if your substats are good
[02:33:43] it's fine I'm going to give you the
[02:33:45] benefit that you went benefit of the
[02:33:46] doubt that you went for sub
[02:33:49] stats uh this yeah I me it's
[02:34:01] fine sorry I'm
[02:34:10] dying okay chat I'm going to say
[02:34:12] something chat is bullying you for
[02:34:13] having a low-level weapon on Yan it's on
[02:34:16] honestly not that big of a deal cuz you
[02:34:17] don't scale on attack so as long as you
[02:34:18] have enough ER leveling your weapon
[02:34:20] doesn't actually do anything other than
[02:34:21] give you more ER so it's not a big deal
[02:34:24] um you're also running triple Hydro so
[02:34:25] you probably don't need that much AR at
[02:34:27] all so it's fine uh I just recommend
[02:34:29] going for a better set you're doing okay
[02:34:31] for a lot of this um Kazaa should be on
[02:34:33] em not crit but I mean your crit you
[02:34:36] also have no ER on your Kaza uh 114 ER
[02:34:39] is not
[02:34:42] enough why are you showing you didn't
[02:34:43] even play shling why am I
[02:34:47] I'm done you're showing me your Shang
[02:34:48] you didn't even play Shang Ling I'm
[02:34:51] done let's move on let's move on next

[02:35:56] right here before your burst you get
[02:35:58] another one before you skill you get one
[02:35:59] before the pyron uh with Pyon it's a bit
[02:36:02] iffy with high ping cuz you want those
[02:36:03] power particles to go to you it's fine
[02:36:05] but please Auto attack

[02:38:24] Octavio okay that pretty good this car

[02:38:31] on
[02:38:32] farizon you hate to see it but you got
[02:38:35] to do what you got to do as a farzon
[02:38:39] player
[02:38:44] um supporting
[02:38:47] fire verman I assume you're not
[02:38:49] reminescence cuz you burst it at the
[02:38:55] start yeah no it's good this just
[02:39:00] good is your far is on
[02:39:03] C6 she is okay you're
[02:39:07] chilling okay next one next one next

[02:39:25] with your gam playay is lacking there's
[02:39:27] no better person to
[02:39:29] call let's see I'll let you know
[02:39:32] instantly I'll give you a gameplay
[02:39:33] rating out of
[02:39:36] 10 start with Kookie uh already starting
[02:39:39] low on the scale because cookies eat
[02:39:40] only lasts for 15 seconds so it
[02:39:42] shouldn't be the first thing you do in
[02:39:43] your rotation often times uh also also
[02:39:45] if you're fast and usually on Lower ping
[02:39:48] 128 I'm not sure if you can but I know
[02:39:50] on Lower ping you get Alyan burst swap
[02:39:52] to cookie press e swap back I'll height
[02:39:54] them and then uh yeah there you go uh 12
[02:39:56] well it's 15 seconds with C2 uh 12 with
[02:40:01] C
[02:40:07] zero it's spread yeah I guess it is
[02:40:09] spread you're not wait what the
[02:40:14] [ __ ] oh um I
[02:40:19] mean I'm not a big fan of this
[02:40:33] rotation yeah you should start with
[02:40:35] alyam burst uh you can like your hold e
[02:40:37] plunge is good if you want three mirrors
[02:40:39] and don't have your burst but if you
[02:40:40] have your burst start with your burst
[02:40:42] there's no reason not to um
[02:40:50] the team is okay you're running
[02:40:52] technically two healers like Ki and
[02:40:53] carar do the same [ __ ] uh I would like
[02:40:56] to have a official in this team ideally
[02:40:58] make it quick Bloon with like yolon or
[02:40:59] SRO but it's fine like the team
[02:41:03] works I would just recommend bursting
[02:41:04] without Hy them first that's all what's
[02:41:06] your second half net finina oh yeah
[02:41:08] you're
[02:41:09] clearing all right next
[02:41:12] one Kirara heals question mark Kirara
[02:41:14] gives you a shield which replaces A
[02:41:16] Healer in most teams the only time it
[02:41:18] doesn't is with uh finina but for the
[02:41:20] most part you usually either need a
[02:41:22] Healer or a
[02:41:27] shielder I used hyper oh [ __ ] okay we
[02:41:32] got sus Among Us lover who says hey I
[02:41:36] use hyper blue on both
[02:41:37] sides Ryden ya ya your Laing show and
[02:41:41] BYU kakomi strongly wait this is no
[02:41:44] dandro
[02:41:45] sorry calm
[02:41:47] down one thing at a time potatoes we
[02:41:50] might need to revisit your hyperboom
[02:41:51] clear after this one let's restart I use
[02:41:53] hyper Bloom team on both sides R in ya
[02:41:55] ya Yan and BYU Ki Jong Le cooki so we
[02:41:58] have the whole [ __ ] ambulance team
[02:41:59] here okay good to know I can't 36 star
[02:42:02] and I'm not sure why since I see many
[02:42:04] people using hyper blo is hyper blo
[02:42:06] overrated Z's take coming up shortly so
[02:42:09] let's see what the problem is maybe it's
[02:42:10] a skill issue maybe hyper you know it's
[02:42:12] not
[02:42:13] good oh I feel like I seen this actually
[02:42:16] last stream but it's fine uh okay so
[02:42:20] here's the thing first of all you don't
[02:42:22] have enough dendro yao yao can apply a
[02:42:24] lot of D in her burst but outside of
[02:42:26] that where's the dend coming from so
[02:42:28] having an onfield dendro applier or just
[02:42:30] an offield one that applies more D even
[02:42:32] dendro MC even Buu like can kind of
[02:42:35] onfield because I know you have Buu you
[02:42:36] could like Nita you could alham there's
[02:42:39] so much you could do but right now you
[02:42:42] have okay Ryden into Hydro character
[02:42:44] this is so far so good you you might
[02:42:45] want to Chuck your yugu out but whatever
[02:42:48] okay you got some Hydro stu yugu okay
[02:42:50] now you're Auto attacking on your em
[02:42:52] Ryden who burst for
[02:42:55] 14,000 and
[02:42:58] um as you can see there is almost no
[02:43:01] dendro wow you got one core ooh two
[02:43:04] cores wow that's some good hyper
[02:43:08] blooms no dentro no dendro no dendro no
[02:43:12] dendro no dendro let's let's let's see
[02:43:15] let's actually see how long since the
[02:43:16] last time he was D applied just to prove
[02:43:19] the point okay D applied okay no more D
[02:43:21] so let's count it's 9 it was 940 on the
[02:43:23] timer okay let's skip 5 Seconds all
[02:43:26] right still no dandro
[02:43:28] 9:30 uh almost 9:25 yeah 9:25 oh oh oh
[02:43:33] 15
[02:43:35] seconds but yeah so not really your
[02:43:38] fault but uh this team needs more D
[02:43:41] that's the main thing and then your
[02:43:42] second
[02:43:44] half
[02:43:53] the second half is an entire ambulance
[02:43:55] if I fall down the stairs if I get hurt
[02:43:58] if I if I if I if I if I cook something
[02:44:02] too hot and I burn my tongue I'm [ __ ]
[02:44:03] calling you you have healer healer
[02:44:08] healer
[02:44:09] shielder oh hyper blo
[02:44:14] sucks
[02:44:17] also
[02:44:20] um something Chad pointed out is your
[02:44:22] ryen on H and Homa Ryden on a full crit
[02:44:25] build very good hom Ryden on a full em
[02:44:28] build very useless your Ryden wants to
[02:44:30] be on full em here not some hybrid [ __ ]
[02:44:32] and you want a good DLI and then you la
[02:44:34] contr really good and then for the other
[02:44:38] team oh wasn't this crit BYU wait let me
[02:44:41] look at your build one second let me
[02:44:43] look at your build yao yao that's fine
[02:44:46] deo's okay de's good actually de's good
[02:44:49] yolon that's a really good yon wow this
[02:44:51] yolon well vescent is okay but you
[02:44:53] definitely should be clearing with this
[02:44:54] level of investment okay let's look at
[02:44:56] the next character SRO what okay the
[02:44:59] crit kind of sucks but it is what it is
[02:45:01] you have enough ER you have a sack sword
[02:45:03] you're doing fine okay let's look at
[02:45:04] your Ryden wait where's Ryden did I skip
[02:45:06] Ryden did you just not show Ryden okay
[02:45:08] by
[02:45:14] you
[02:45:19] Am I Dreaming am I seeing things is this
[02:45:22] BYU or is this [ __ ] Aly them why is
[02:45:24] your Buu on look I am a strong advocate
[02:45:29] for build characters the way you want if
[02:45:31] you want to DPS your like you know if
[02:45:33] you want to make a character your main
[02:45:34] DPS do it if you want your BYU to be
[02:45:36] your carry do it but why is he typically
[02:45:40] I don't recommend full crit BYU now even
[02:45:43] if you want to play full crit BYU
[02:45:45] honestly you can you could put them on
[02:45:46] field like I don't recommend it but like
[02:45:48] you could put them on field Auto attack
[02:45:50] in your hyper Bloom team and you'll
[02:45:51] still clear if your hyper Bloomer is
[02:45:53] built cuz your hyperon is the one doing
[02:45:54] the damage so if you're
[02:45:57] C that's the first time I've seen that
[02:45:59] weapon on him if your Kookie has enough
[02:46:03] em you should be fine in a hyper Bloom
[02:46:05] team okay your kokomi could be on like
[02:46:07] any set it it's whatever she's just
[02:46:09] there to apply Hydro although kokomi
[02:46:11] might not be enough Hydro from off field
[02:46:12] you probably want like Singo or yolan
[02:46:14] you could yoink one from the other team
[02:46:15] but
[02:46:17] anyways uh your cookie has okay first of
[02:46:20] all I pointed this out last time I
[02:46:22] reacted to this cuz I just remembered
[02:46:24] that we definitely reacted to this
[02:46:25] before your BYU is on Full crit on a
[02:46:29] level one
[02:46:31] normal what why are you on full crit if
[02:46:33] you're not going to attack do you not
[02:46:35] care about baiju are you just trolling
[02:46:37] me if you do level your normal this has
[02:46:41] to be bait also uh your [ __ ] um
[02:46:46] your KGI on 352 Em which means your
[02:46:50] hyper looms are doing negative damage
[02:46:52] please build Em I'm now going to assume
[02:46:54] this is bait because your name is sus
[02:46:56] Among Us lover and we'll move on to the
[02:46:58] next one but uh for reference you should
[02:46:59] just go full em cookie and you will
[02:47:01] already be carrying even if your other
[02:47:03] characters are almost almost not built
[02:47:05] you still want to build your other
[02:47:06] characters uh but actually for a
[02:47:09] Showcase of this let me pull up a
[02:47:13] clear
[02:47:15] by uh twitch user several
[02:47:19] potatoes let me show you something so
[02:47:22] this [ __ ] submitted a clip
[02:47:24] called
[02:47:25] stunlock H why is it called stun
[02:47:28] loock let's look at what he played so
[02:47:30] for his second half first half was some
[02:47:32] hydroa [ __ ] uh we don't talk about it
[02:47:35] second half they submitted Nita R in
[02:47:39] Shogun double Hydro okay pretty good
[02:47:42] Hydro team now something you're going to
[02:47:44] notice here is that the characters that
[02:47:46] aren't hyper bling are kind of not
[02:47:48] dealing that good damage there's like
[02:47:49] 1000s there's like 5,000 right not that
[02:47:52] great right not that great but the hyper
[02:47:55] Bloom is doing like one sec can you
[02:47:59] hyper Bloom whoa was that over 30k on
[02:48:02] your hyper well that was 20 but whatever
[02:48:04] the Hy was doing like 31k right okay and
[02:48:07] as you can see they clear in enough time
[02:48:09] to get Nine Stars hm that's pretty good
[02:48:13] now when you look at the build you'll
[02:48:15] notice something let turn off the builds
[02:48:18] first of all back the [ __ ] up from your
[02:48:20] mic this isn't
[02:48:22] valerant got the fourar ciret so there's
[02:48:26] guilded dreams with the four star ciret
[02:48:28] which um given my experience with Hyper
[02:48:32] blo is good enough for is good like a
[02:48:35] lot of people say it's hard to get yeah
[02:48:37] Main St just go you can just go a fourar
[02:48:39] circlet it's not that big of a deal or
[02:48:41] one of the pieces that you're missing
[02:48:42] ideally you just go main stats but if
[02:48:43] you're unlucky you're unlucky right it's
[02:48:45] off piece goblet fourstar ciret and then
[02:48:47] on set sense right stop ding
[02:48:51] flush uh so this is that's that's the
[02:48:53] right and now let's look at the other
[02:48:55] characters what's your sing CH on what's
[02:48:57] your sing CH on what's your sing CH
[02:49:00] on 633
[02:49:03] attack we got
[02:49:08] get dull
[02:49:11] blade okay let's look at yolan off the
[02:49:15] five warble level 70 on uh missing one
[02:49:18] second missing two pieces H okay I
[02:49:22] thought hyper Bloom was bad I thought
[02:49:24] you needed your characters well built to
[02:49:26] clear with Hyper Bloom and then Nita
[02:49:27] Apprentice
[02:49:29] notes Apprentice notes deepwood cuz you
[02:49:33] need
[02:49:34] deepwood luck
[02:49:37] okay hyper blo just needs a well-built
[02:49:40] hyper Bloomer Kookie Ryden whatever even
[02:49:42] sucros you do like sucros official to
[02:49:44] hyper bloom
[02:49:45] and then the other characters like yeah
[02:49:47] ideally they're good right ideally have
[02:49:48] a well-built SRO well-built iyo net well
[02:49:51] Net's not mostly for hyper blo but
[02:49:53] whatever right Al them fish uh uh well
[02:49:55] like any character okay but as long as
[02:49:59] your hyper blo is built you're going to
[02:50:01] clear for the most
[02:50:03] partal insan what the [ __ ] is your
[02:50:05] official bro created Another Universe
[02:50:07] and founded Paradise

[02:51:34] faster okay let me go back
[02:51:37] sorry uh let's look at another let's
[02:51:39] look at another oh Cloud I know this guy
[02:51:40] wait did we already look at this I feel
[02:51:42] like I might have already seen this
[02:51:45] wait a second first of all you're my
[02:51:46] moderator and you don't have 36 Stars
[02:51:50] you're literally a twitch
[02:51:54] mod okay let's look at how you uh first
[02:51:57] of all you're clicking the characters so
[02:51:58] slow I already I can already tell this
[02:52:00] is going to be a skill issue no
[02:52:01] disrespect your Goro's level 50 I feel
[02:52:03] like I already seen this uh this is
[02:52:06] bringing back memories you're playing EO
[02:52:09] with
[02:52:11] Navia Gia Laing cherina that's actually
[02:52:13] not a bad team
[02:52:16] uh you don't have an onfield auto
[02:52:18] attacker really but you can just quick
[02:52:19] swap between them it's fine uh I feel
[02:52:22] like I saw this let's
[02:52:33] see
[02:52:35] question why are you running Etho and
[02:52:37] Navia why you're running two DPSS and
[02:52:40] one of which that doesn't even scale on
[02:52:41] defense and one that one that scales on
[02:52:43] attack and one that scales on defense
[02:52:44] which means you're running like Goro for
[02:52:46] one and Bennett for the other although
[02:52:47] EO can use Bennett a little bit um I
[02:52:50] think if you just benched one of the two
[02:52:52] and you made a team around one of the
[02:52:54] two preferably Navia this would be a lot
[02:53:05] [Music]
[02:53:10] better I'm going to pretend I didn't see
[02:53:13] that
[02:53:16] let's go back one let's go back
[02:53:25] another zardo
[02:53:28] Z your total Abyss Stars 29 sucros fruit
[02:53:33] salad without the
[02:53:35] hydro what what the [ __ ] is salad
[02:53:38] without the hydro why is this time stamp
[02:53:40] at 10
[02:53:42] minutes oh cuz there's no to
[02:53:45] cuzz you're fighting the TPA I guess cuz
[02:53:46] you don't want Hydro but even then wait
[02:53:50] what the [ __ ] is this team are you
[02:53:51] playing aggravate oh this looks like
[02:53:53] aggravate right
[02:53:55] everyone the Temple of
[02:53:58] wisdom enh animal modes out of my way
[02:54:01] you just swirled dendro oh my God you
[02:54:04] just swirled dendro oh my god dude
[02:54:08] you're to
[02:54:09] gross please
[02:54:13] roll
[02:54:15] hey our bond is strong lightning take
[02:54:19] yourself
[02:54:24] a inum shin
[02:54:28] Eternal we' seen this one as well
[02:54:32] dude okay Z
[02:54:36] strike the Pumpkin King okay b
[02:54:43] b
[02:54:46] okay cool uh let's look at
[02:54:55] this
[02:54:57] okay what is this you have red kazua SRO
[02:55:01] BYU uh arguably the worst team of all
[02:55:05] time but the characters are really good
[02:55:06] SRO top tier character Kaza top to your
[02:55:08] character Ryden very strong baiju very
[02:55:11] strong especially with finina um
[02:55:14] somehow I mean you might be a hyper
[02:55:16] Bloom team but I assume I actually don't
[02:55:18] know I'm not going to judge too
[02:55:23] early okay you swirl dendro
[02:55:29] again please stop swirling D you
[02:55:34] you oh my god dude if you just swirled D
[02:55:37] like five times
[02:55:40] um is this hyper Blom or are you DP the
[02:55:44] side
[02:55:54] effects okay this looks like hyper Bloom
[02:55:56] if it is Kazo is not needed in this team
[02:55:58] okay Kazo is not needed in this team K
[02:56:01] is one of the most broken units of all
[02:56:03] time not needed in this team you should
[02:56:04] do R in if you want to do bying contr
[02:56:07] you can but your last slot should be
[02:56:08] another element so you could do uh maybe
[02:56:11] an onfield or like another hydro and
[02:56:13] then onfield your by for a lot of dendro
[02:56:15] or you could offield by maybe put
[02:56:16] another dendro something else right and
[02:56:19] then cuz you right now
[02:56:21] like
[02:56:23] like let's look at your gameplay this is
[02:56:25] supposed to be gameplay review let's
[02:56:26] look at your
[02:56:34] gameplay if there was a ranked system in
[02:56:37] this game you would be bronze I'm sorry
[02:56:40] I'm sorry you're on mobile Mobile's hard
[02:56:43] okay I suck on my phone phone I suck on
[02:56:44] my phone let let me watch let me watch
[02:56:46] let me watch okay let's watch from the
[02:56:48] start let's watch from the start so
[02:56:51] write an e that is good SRO E I mean
[02:56:54] burst into e that's good so far so good
[02:56:56] by you E Auto attack and then Q you
[02:56:58] didn't Auto it's fine um okay okay once
[02:57:03] again Chad let's play the game of when's
[02:57:05] the last time you saw sro's rain sword
[02:57:07] so for this entire duration keep in mind
[02:57:09] sro's burst has been active and you did
[02:57:11] not fire
[02:57:13] oops you did not fire a single normal
[02:57:15] attack from that e you didn't fire a
[02:57:17] normal attack another time you could
[02:57:19] have and another time you could have
[02:57:21] with SRO try to weave in normal attacks
[02:57:23] between everything that's fine though
[02:57:24] you still use your abilities your Kazo
[02:57:27] swirled
[02:57:28] nothing um But like after that it's
[02:57:31] really hard to mess up a hyper Bloom
[02:57:32] team as long as you press your abilities
[02:57:33] you're winning but Kwa doesn't really
[02:57:35] contribute anything here um so that's
[02:57:41] unfortunate wait what the [ __ ] it's 7
[02:57:43] minutes that's a
[02:57:57] you okay SW
[02:58:06] Hydro Bro you're
[02:58:12] right
[02:58:15] I actually don't want to talk about that
[02:58:16] clear I'm sorry it just made me sad I'm
[02:58:17] sorry let's look at the next
[02:58:30] half what the [ __ ] is this
[02:58:37] team okay I mean uh suon Oz Bennett
[02:58:44] please use Rosario
[02:58:51] burst what did he
[02:58:54] say usually my right is not built for
[02:58:56] hyper I barely repl T right don't have D
[02:58:58] bu stuff and Stan
[02:59:01] Luna um okay I don't recommend physical
[02:59:06] shenan now let's say you really love
[02:59:08] shenan you're like I love shenan I want
[02:59:10] to play shenan cool you can but ideally
[02:59:15] like a mono Pyro Team or something like
[02:59:18] that I wouldn't recommend physical
[02:59:19] shenan it's not very good if you want a
[02:59:21] Nine Star it's one of the worst ways to
[02:59:22] get it um but it's
[02:59:27] okay I just don't have much to
[02:59:42] say I would is
[02:59:48] this wait why am I at 9:26 did I already
[02:59:51] react to this chat did we already watch

[03:00:22] illusion yo what is
[03:00:26] thisd to and spicy inum shines Eternal I
[03:00:34] mean this is actually a good team kind
[03:00:37] of like it's fine oh actually I thought
[03:00:40] you had Chev for some reason it'd be
[03:00:42] better with the ch but it's fine it's
[03:00:44] actually it's actually not bad you're
[03:00:46] playing like kind of hyper carry you
[03:00:48] also have a Shang langing it's
[03:00:52] fine There Is No Escape now You Shall
[03:00:55] Perish why is the floor blue I I don't
[03:00:57] know
[03:00:59] man
[03:01:02] uh this team's good
[03:01:05] too yeah you have
[03:01:08] have you going to watch new clears we
[03:01:11] could sword by new fine I'll sword by
[03:01:16] you what is
[03:01:18] this day One genon Gamer quit 12
[03:01:22] times I respect
[03:01:29] that all right let's look so what are
[03:01:32] your okay okay okay let's look at your
[03:01:34] teams going into this so you have sug
[03:01:36] SRO official already really good last
[03:01:38] slot is ALB uh I would recommend like b
[03:01:41] instead I think if you remove the owl
[03:01:44] becomes a much better character bet here
[03:01:45] would be insane in the in this Abyss
[03:01:47] rotation though first half is very
[03:01:49] single Target so I understand not using
[03:01:51] bet okay fair game in this Abyss I
[03:01:53] wouldn't however um I still think
[03:01:56] there's usually better options than albo
[03:01:58] even like a dendr option could be fine
[03:02:00] uh and then you are hyper blooming on
[03:02:02] sucros but it's fine I'll let you cook I
[03:02:04] will let you cook ning Wong on the
[03:02:06] second half we respect ning Wong let's
[03:02:07] see what you have to show us uh let's
[03:02:10] see what you have to show us okay I
[03:02:13] probably would place out albo's e but uh
[03:02:16] you know this is
[03:02:18] fine okay this is fine you place albo e
[03:02:21] uh burst is kind of questionable that
[03:02:23] takes a lot of time but it's fine you
[03:02:25] should swap the sugr to get some swirls
[03:02:26] in okay
[03:02:29] um okay judging by your damage in almost
[03:02:32] one full rotation I'm actually going to
[03:02:34] take back everything I said the albo is
[03:02:36] not okay all right please seek help
[03:02:38] sorry please replace him even dendro MC
[03:02:41] would be fine and then you could hyper
[03:02:42] on sucros you could go yolan if you I
[03:02:44] don't know you have finina we you have a
[03:02:46] bench finina why is your finina benched
[03:02:49] unbench the finina Bro go like Farina
[03:02:51] Jean or something why is finina benched
[03:02:53] she's
[03:02:55] broken even on the second half you can
[03:02:57] play finina but finina should not be
[03:03:00] benched
[03:03:01] here um there's definitely a much better
[03:03:04] character you you also have Navia okay
[03:03:07] this feels like a troll account cuz you
[03:03:08] can just use Navia like H let's let's
[03:03:11] that feels like
[03:03:12] troll
[03:03:15] Heavenly principles mute video
[03:03:20] okay um this looks fine oh [ __ ] what did
[03:03:23] I just
[03:03:25] do
[03:03:27] no
[03:03:28] Ramen Navia with a Zio recommended team
[03:03:32] and a randomly put together nevet team
[03:03:35] anything else POG bike what the [ __ ] is
[03:03:37] POG
[03:03:42] bike
[03:03:47] um wait let's look at your
[03:03:49] characters
[03:03:54] okay okay so you don't have any five
[03:03:57] star GE supports for Navia so you're
[03:04:00] using Bennett SRO Shang Ling
[03:04:02] unironically not bad uh I will say gomc
[03:04:07] and or ning Wong as the second Gio have
[03:04:09] grown on me since she came out I think
[03:04:10] it's viable to just put either of those
[03:04:12] there double
[03:04:14] uh so if you want double Jo you can for
[03:04:16] Navia but this team is like Navia
[03:04:19] Bennett and Jo shling will clear so like
[03:04:22] it's not a bad team uh second half like
[03:04:24] you
[03:04:25] know second half nevet kazua fishal
[03:04:30] Lea do I like the team no is it fine
[03:04:33] yeah Net's broken F's broken kaz's
[03:04:36] broken it'll be fine we should be able
[03:04:38] to clear with
[03:04:39] this not sure about the Lila but your
[03:04:41] Lila's okay all right it's not bad so
[03:04:44] here you did wait let's look at your
[03:04:46] rotation Navia vers first that's
[03:04:49] good I would do s before benett just for
[03:04:51] uptime things but whatever I won't judge
[03:04:55] you uh no okay this is fine this is fine
[03:05:00] you want to weave in some normal attacks
[03:05:02] okay
[03:05:05] okay
[03:05:08] um so something you'll notice
[03:05:11] is hey o why did you say sing TR before
[03:05:15] Bennett huh is it just because you like
[03:05:17] to do that huh well maybe if your benett
[03:05:22] field lasted longer your Navia skill
[03:05:24] right here instead of doing 80k might do
[03:05:27] like 10 and something your bennit field
[03:05:28] might be up longer and you might
[03:05:30] actually benit buff your skill because
[03:05:33] now this huge chunk of damage is not uh
[03:05:35] buffed because you benit aled earlier
[03:05:37] part of the reason why DEA can be
[03:05:38] annoying to play in some teams is
[03:05:40] because her field doesn't last that long
[03:05:41] so if you have to use her field at the
[03:05:43] end of your rotation or like before
[03:05:45] swapping into your carry you lose out on
[03:05:47] some of bit's up time because you use
[03:05:48] bit before your de whereas if you're
[03:05:50] running strongly you could dra Le before
[03:05:52] you benett true so uh yeah you lost a
[03:05:55] lot of damage there you should have
[03:05:56] bened aled later
[03:06:00] um this is fine Bennett Al yeah I mean
[03:06:04] again you should do SRO before Bennett
[03:06:06] but it's fine and if you don't want to
[03:06:08] think about these things while you're
[03:06:09] playing just put your team in an order
[03:06:11] that you'll remember so for example you
[03:06:12] do nav then SRO then Bennett then Shang
[03:06:15] Ling boom easy order you don't have to
[03:06:17] [Music]
[03:06:27] think
[03:06:29] um this is fine here you could
[03:06:32] preemptively SN trob burst you run here
[03:06:34] s trob burst now again bet it
[03:06:39] like like bened buffing your SRO is not
[03:06:41] bad it's just you would rather you want
[03:06:44] to make sure your Bennett is buffing
[03:06:46] your nav's damage if you can get that
[03:06:48] like here you kind of got it so it's
[03:06:50] fine um although your normal attacks are
[03:06:52] not buffed
[03:06:53] now yes doesn't
[03:06:56] snapshot okay let's at second
[03:07:00] half what was that
[03:07:06] loading okay all
[03:07:08] good um net cooa official
[03:07:14] [Music]
[03:07:16] burst
[03:07:18] okay
[03:07:21] okay probably should cause over so it's
[03:07:26] fine
[03:07:36] um you should try to swirl Hydro I don't
[03:07:39] know if you did it on the first one but
[03:07:41] swirling Hydro you can swirl Hydro on
[03:07:42] the Thunder manifestation if you apply
[03:07:45] uh hydro and Electro you should be able
[03:07:46] to let's see if you get it no you didn't
[03:07:50] um you might have did it on the first
[03:07:51] one though and then your no light will
[03:07:53] do a lot more
[03:07:57] damage you can't wait
[03:08:01] really I guess it depends on
[03:08:03] the character right cuz I know some can
[03:08:06] wait what the [ __ ] you should be able to
[03:08:09] actually I'm like positive you can I
[03:08:11] don't know why I'm doubting myself this
[03:08:12] is what happens when I play Star for
[03:08:14] tooo long I start forgetting get of
[03:08:15] things you definitely can I've
[03:08:16] definitely done
[03:08:18] it anyways you can and you
[03:08:22] should uh no yeah the time is not easy
[03:08:26] yeah but like you have a lot of tries
[03:08:28] like if you [ __ ] it up you could just
[03:08:29] try again like so uh I mean I guess
[03:08:33] that's not true with nevet cuz you can
[03:08:34] only burst or skill once
[03:08:38] but
[03:08:42] yeah
[03:08:44] anyways if you can you should try to srl
[03:08:46] hydro and you can for the thunder man if
[03:08:48] you just need to apply both at the same
[03:08:50] time you also just normal yeah you can
[03:08:53] literally normal with NAD and then swap
[03:08:55] but you probably would like
[03:08:58] burst
[03:09:01] um this this
[03:09:11] fine
[03:09:16] I
[03:09:17] mean okay I'm going to say it why is
[03:09:20] your noet doing six damage let me look
[03:09:22] at your builds let me look at your
[03:09:23] builds Navia uh this is fine if you're
[03:09:26] on MAR CH cuz you're low crit raate but
[03:09:27] I assume
[03:09:28] you're wait why do you have no crit rate
[03:09:31] what the
[03:09:41] [ __ ]
[03:09:44] okay you definitely want more crit rate
[03:09:46] on on your
[03:09:47] Navia uh but
[03:09:50] what bro level okay okay first level
[03:09:55] your other level your talents please
[03:09:57] please level your talents before farming
[03:09:59] artifacts it's it's so much more damage

[03:10:03] AIA but your other abilities matter too
[03:10:05] okay your weapon's not even level 90
[03:10:08] your Wolf's grav Stone's level 20 not
[03:10:09] being used but it is what it is I guess

[03:10:59] is actually good why are you doing
[03:11:00] negative
[03:11:11] damage
[03:11:15] dude you would actually clear so fast if
[03:11:18] you swirled hydro and ran like good
[03:11:20] supports like no disrespect to Lila but
[03:11:24] like you could do so much better even
[03:11:26] Lila's fine if you like apply like if
[03:11:29] you buff Net's thing where you Pro a
[03:11:31] hydro reaction and then you do more
[03:11:33] damage but you can't really do that
[03:11:34] against the Thunderman
[03:11:41] if
[03:11:51] yeah your A1 is not fully stacked that's
[03:11:55] true let's see second let's see chamber
[03:11:58] three how do you not let do here cuz it
[03:11:59] might be easier for you to do it
[03:12:02] here cuz your never let build is
[03:12:04] actually not
[03:12:11] bad
[03:12:14] like yeah your n's fine here I I
[03:12:16] actually don't think your Net's bad it's
[03:12:18] just okay what the [ __ ] was that you're
[03:12:20] never that's fine it's just you need to
[03:12:22] like make sure you're actually proing
[03:12:23] reactions that's
[03:12:27] all uh but you do want to swirl Hydro if
[03:12:29] you can like always try to swirl Hydro
[03:12:32] in this team swirling Electro is good
[03:12:33] too but
[03:12:35] yeah yeah that's your main
[03:12:38] thing but uh it's not that
[03:12:41] bad
[03:12:49] let me see
[03:12:55] something let me see
[03:12:58] something cuz you also have a signature
[03:13:00] weapon you're on [ __ ]
[03:13:06] toome what the [ __ ] is this Abyss
[03:13:11] again
[03:13:15] oh
[03:13:17] these like look I'm lit playing two
[03:13:19] characters
[03:13:20] SW how much do I do like this is doing
[03:13:23] 31 this is doing 36 K with two
[03:13:25] characters yeah I probably have a better
[03:13:27] investment level but
[03:13:29] like you have a really good nlet and a
[03:13:32] signature weapon and mine's C02 and you
[03:13:34] have
[03:13:36] Kaza so I don't know uh I think you need
[03:13:39] to make sure you s Hydra and probably
[03:13:41] some team comp stuff like you want to
[03:13:42] make make sure your proing is passive
[03:13:43] more uh
[03:13:45] but I mean I'm not even they have 31k HP
[03:13:48] I'm not even 31k I just have a lot of
[03:13:51] crit they have 270 crit damage wait let
[03:13:54] me look let me look some
[03:13:56] more let me look some
[03:14:04] more yeah I mean my crit damage is
[03:14:08] higher like I think my build's better
[03:14:10] but like they have home as
[03:14:13] well and M
[03:14:17] Shi like it's a good build there also
[03:14:19] Crown normal attacks mine is
[03:14:27] not but
[03:14:29] yeah yeah no Swirl Let me actually let's
[03:14:32] let's look at the difference let me show
[03:14:34] you the difference between not swirling
[03:14:36] and swirling let me show you the
[03:14:40] difference look
[03:14:44] look at what happens if we don't
[03:14:46] swirl it's literally like half the okay
[03:14:49] not half but like 2/3 of the damage it's
[03:14:52] so much worse instead of doing 36 count
[03:14:56] doing
[03:14:58] 21 the wind now boom
[03:15:04] see
[03:15:08] yeah dude why is someone in my chat
[03:15:10] having a breakdown dude play the game
[03:15:13] I'm sorry I'm sorry we are reviewing
[03:15:17] wait what the [ __ ] is your Shang Ling on
[03:15:19] I don't even want to know
[03:15:23] actually okay uh let's look at another
[03:15:26] one your
[03:15:27] papa second team needs help all right
[03:15:29] let's look what is
[03:15:33] this I need help please
[03:15:41] okay
[03:15:43] Bennett Shang Ling rden fishal this is
[03:15:45] fine I like shers in this team or like
[03:15:48] Kaza but you know it's fine or yolan
[03:15:51] instead of official like you could do
[03:15:52] like a rational
[03:15:59] but no
[03:16:06] ese can hydro on Thunder Manny you can
[03:16:09] hydro plunge but not swirl too much
[03:16:11] gauge am I getting one guide I'm
[03:16:14] actually gonna test this because I feel
[03:16:16] like I might be getting one
[03:16:20] guide I feel like I might as well know
[03:16:22] this actually
[03:16:25] okay let me see if it's
[03:16:29] true then thanks for letting me know if
[03:16:32] it's not true then [ __ ]
[03:16:36] you for one guying
[03:16:40] me what's the best way I think we do do
[03:16:42] Kaza sucros in the team uh Kaza sucros
[03:16:46] and then a shield so I don't [ __ ] die
[03:16:48] uh there's no Hydro shielder
[03:16:49] unfortunately so we'll put Jonathan
[03:16:52] Lee I I can do
[03:16:58] it um what's the fastest I
[03:17:02] mean okay let me first test my damage
[03:17:05] just so I know how much I'm going to do
[03:17:06] if I swirl so we're doing 20ks uh now
[03:17:09] let me TP there and back just to make
[03:17:11] sure
[03:17:32] oh I didn't get it there 25 is probably
[03:17:35] just from the yeah the [ __ ] passive
[03:17:38] wait wait let me get more although I
[03:17:40] guess no let wait actually wait
[03:17:45] toi oh [ __ ] wore off let me try sucr
[03:17:49] really
[03:17:50] fast I can't swap wait one
[03:17:54] sec no I didn't get it there well I
[03:17:57] could just normal though I don't even
[03:17:59] need to charge wait what if I just
[03:18:01] do did that SW Electro how much do I do
[03:18:05] wait no I missed wait let me try
[03:18:09] again you can check Coo's p passive what
[03:18:13] do you mean like to see if it's
[03:18:16] swirled oh yeah I guess I could just
[03:18:18] open the [ __ ] stats
[03:18:22] right like I could just do
[03:18:25] this because of
[03:18:27] this wait no not this
[03:18:33] this guide maker well I haven't tested
[03:18:35] against thunder man if before cuz [ __ ]
[03:18:37] this
[03:18:39] enemy yeah I didn't
[03:18:45] that's interesting okay maybe you I mean
[03:18:47] surely you
[03:18:57] can as one with
[03:19:00] wind [ __ ] he ran away no he ran
[03:19:08] away
[03:19:10] solidify I think G with Barbara okay but
[03:19:13] genan with Barbara could do
[03:19:16] anything let the mighty be humble bow
[03:19:19] your
[03:19:21] head I didn't get it
[03:19:25] there yeah it disappears really fast
[03:19:28] either way even if like even if he
[03:19:31] wasn't
[03:19:33] uh actually one
[03:19:38] sec come
[03:19:41] here
[03:19:56] solidify wi that was literally as fast
[03:19:58] as I could have
[03:20:00] done I got Electro not Hydro so I guess
[03:20:02] you can't with that here maybe it's just
[03:20:05] cuz it's yeah it's probably just never
[03:20:06] let what's this maybe with burst does
[03:20:10] burst apply more Hydro
[03:20:12] is burst burst is higher uh hyra op
[03:20:24] right
[03:20:27] gather both one U does he not have
[03:20:29] anything more than one U damn n that
[03:20:31] sucks wait just go double Hydra then but
[03:20:33] you what if they don't have finina I
[03:20:37] guess hits
[03:20:40] twice let me try let me get my burst let
[03:20:42] me see if I
[03:20:44] can okay let me see if I
[03:20:48] can you can use tar tag I gu you play
[03:20:52] jail you play jail child just to swirl
[03:20:58] Hydro okay let me
[03:21:06] see
[03:21:10] solidify would would be the best way to
[03:21:12] do
[03:21:16] this yeah okay let me
[03:21:23] seei I don't think we got
[03:21:25] it yeah we didn't okay yeah I think you
[03:21:29] need another Hydra then unless you
[03:21:31] somehow get
[03:21:36] it like there it also well it's on
[03:21:38] sucros but
[03:21:40] you
[03:21:43] yeah you
[03:21:50] can uh where was I let's go back here
[03:21:53] okay good to know either way
[03:22:03] though that may multi Ora reaction it's
[03:22:06] been a
[03:22:08] while I assume you just always get
[03:22:10] Electro
[03:22:14] okay well good to know thank you chatter
[03:22:18] anyways let me rephrase that
[03:22:22] then
[03:22:37] um uh where's my [ __ ] OBS there it
[03:22:40] is either way let me rephrase that wait
[03:22:44] where the what the [ __ ] did I just
[03:22:47] close uh this one which one the [ __ ]
[03:22:59] net isn't Hydro higher than Electro yes
[03:23:01] for ca's priority yes but
[03:23:05] uh I'm not sure how the thunder man if
[03:23:07] Works in particular I haven't like I
[03:23:10] don't know I haven't [ __ ] DC thunder
[03:23:12] man if should I
[03:23:21] probably [ __ ] did I just
[03:23:23] open where is it oh it's this one no
[03:23:26] this Navia okay I actually don't know
[03:23:27] where it is okay whatever I'll just say
[03:23:30] it then the whoever the nevet person was
[03:23:33] you still okay they still weren't Hydro
[03:23:35] swirling in any content like against the
[03:23:37] like the [ __ ] laow trrs and [ __ ] so
[03:23:38] just Hydro swirl against the thunder man
[03:23:40] if if you can't liter Lally just play a
[03:23:42] character that's not official or Leila
[03:23:44] and you'll actually have damage in your
[03:23:45] team for the most part that's probably
[03:23:47] the only thing you're
[03:23:48] missing so
[03:23:54] yers
[03:24:00] yers okay what is
[03:24:07] this
[03:24:10] shall Shine Down uh this is fine
[03:24:14] honestly this is actually good you're
[03:24:15] clearing in a good time this is
[03:24:36] fine oh yeah I can move my
[03:24:40] shot okay what's this
[03:25:00] uh I mean this team is pretty brainless
[03:25:03] uh you probably should just run hyper
[03:25:04] Bloom though I don't really like mono
[03:25:09] Hydro uh without finina at least I don't
[03:25:11] really to the
[03:25:15] point but it's
[03:25:28] fine okay Chad I'm bored okay I'll do
[03:25:31] like two
[03:25:33] more Richie charge attack oh we're not
[03:25:37] watching charge
[03:25:40] attacks I I love YULA oh God okay let's
[03:25:48] look the [ __ ] is title text
[03:25:53] here bro the [ __ ] is this adventure team
[03:26:01] assemble
[03:26:06] hello um wait was that a C6 Navia or
[03:26:10] just benett
[03:26:13] I don't think
[03:26:16] so okay I got to
[03:26:20] clear okay you got NAIA shling ning Wong
[03:26:25] vett sure I I
[03:26:29] mean okay you ran through the field for
[03:26:31] geo damage bonus you ran through it
[03:26:34] twice for some reason I I don't think
[03:26:35] you need to look through go through it
[03:26:36] twice but that's okay uh Navia burst was
[03:26:39] a little late probably would have done
[03:26:40] that at the start of your
[03:26:41] rotation uh now you don't have Bennett
[03:26:44] anymore will you use your second e
[03:26:46] without okay yes you still not benett
[03:26:48] buffed
[03:26:50] um feeling lucky still not Ben buffed
[03:26:53] it's
[03:26:56] nothing
[03:26:59] subit oh my God okay okay okay okay this
[03:27:02] is still not even like this damage is
[03:27:04] okay but you do so much more damage if
[03:27:07] you like properly use your Bennett so
[03:27:09] imagine if here you start with nav to
[03:27:11] get passive crystallizes then benol
[03:27:14] that's good swap the shin
[03:27:16] Lane please use your Pyon there's no
[03:27:18] reason not to Pyon there okay this is
[03:27:21] fine don't waste my
[03:27:24] time please why is your pyro please
[03:27:29] Pyon and you Pyon after benett
[03:27:40] Altis
[03:27:44] yeah you don't have good up time on your
[03:27:46] B here like uh especially for a lot of
[03:27:48] your Navia
[03:27:49] damage but you did good
[03:27:55] damage wait was your Navia C6 or is this
[03:27:57] c z no no no cuz you
[03:27:59] have well I actually don't know what the
[03:28:01] [ __ ] cuz I saw constellation what was it
[03:28:03] for was it just lyette no no you're not
[03:28:06] you're
[03:28:08] not yeah I'll just
[03:28:10] benett
[03:28:13] okay yeah okay what's your second half
[03:28:15] first half is fine you cleared an 840
[03:28:17] you're fine or wait maybe not up never
[03:28:20] mind out of the brute please snap shot
[03:28:24] Shang Ling pretend Shang Ling's alt
[03:28:27] can't be used unless you're inside benit
[03:28:28] field it's like you can't just pretend
[03:28:30] that it's like it's like grayed out and
[03:28:32] you don't have it
[03:28:34] ready e again e again e again e again
[03:28:37] that's fine dude 172k is actually pretty
[03:28:40] good with no adult make a home your
[03:28:44] Navia is good
[03:28:48] but
[03:28:50] yolon we're playing hyper blo yolan will
[03:28:54] be mine I mean YULA hyper BL
[03:28:58] YULA
[03:28:59] um certainly a
[03:29:04] choice everyone help him
[03:29:09] help quietly now
[03:29:12] I mean it is her best team dude don't
[03:29:14] say that YULA Ms could be watching you
[03:29:17] you look Farina you can do like YULA
[03:29:19] finina Ry in you know you could you can
[03:29:21] do some
[03:29:23] things
[03:29:26] shut
[03:29:28] okay
[03:29:31] um this enem is not fun for YULA I'm
[03:29:34] going to be honest not a fun enemy for
[03:29:40] YULA
[03:29:42] unironically you would clear Faster by
[03:29:44] not switching to Ula but let's not talk
[03:29:46] about that
[03:29:51] shutter the Temple of
[03:29:53] wisdom
[03:29:55] Crush
[03:29:57] gotcha from our bond is
[03:30:00] strong f for
[03:30:06] Mercy
[03:30:10] Crush
[03:30:19] okay you cleared in 653 if you just
[03:30:22] reset and did a bit better you would
[03:30:23] have three started you you you can your
[03:30:25] team your builds are actually good you
[03:30:27] just need to B at Al before using other
[03:30:29] stuff on Navia and you need to bench
[03:30:31] YULA I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that
[03:30:33] your YULA team was good uh but you're
[03:30:34] playing hyper Bloom so swapping it to
[03:30:36] youa as a DPS loss but it's fine you can
[03:30:38] still play it you hyper you know you
[03:30:40] super conduct without team it's all good
[03:30:41] good um I like
[03:30:43] youa uh I will say now I'm getting bored
[03:30:47] of this so we're going to go play uh G
[03:30:49] impact but that was I'll keep reviewing
[03:30:51] the other ones later but that was a good
[03:30:53] part one it's a good part one
[03:30:56] um something I'm going to do before I
[03:30:59] play genin myself the week resets in
[03:31:01] [ __ ] 30 minutes holy [ __ ] I still
[03:31:05] need to do my
[03:31:07] weeklys
[03:31:09] anyways
[03:31:12] anytime I could be a better genin player
[03:31:14] I try to right try to have you know the
[03:31:17] more knowledge the merrier right I've
[03:31:19] watched hours of zff talking about
[03:31:21] Elemental
[03:31:22] gauge so now let's watch six minutes
[03:31:26] hello everyone of a [ __ ] 10 video all
[03:31:29] right what the [ __ ] is this let's watch
[03:31:32] this it would seem I need to learn all
[03:31:36] right get your [ __ ] notepads out of
[03:31:38] genin Science and today we're going to
[03:31:40] be talking about multi Ora and why it
[03:31:42] would be significantly important in the
[03:31:44] upcoming genin 3.0 patch with the Rel
[03:31:47] first let's explain to be fair in my
[03:31:50] defense Thunder manif hasn't been in the
[03:31:52] abyss for like [ __ ] years okay so
[03:31:53] [ __ ] that piece of [ __ ] what is a multi
[03:31:55] Ora reaction in G impact there are
[03:31:57] certain elements that can coexist with
[03:31:59] each other which refer to as multi or
[03:32:02] for example it's possible to apply both
[03:32:04] Electro and hydro on the Enemy at the
[03:32:06] same time what I mean is that if you
[03:32:07] then trigger in reaction you then
[03:32:09] trigger a multi or reaction
[03:32:11] here as you apply pyro it react with
[03:32:13] both Electro and hydro which is oh so
[03:32:16] can I play Ryden with like SRO and Shang
[03:32:20] Ling sorry Ora and causing both overload
[03:32:23] and vaporized this is a multi Ora
[03:32:26] reaction as the name imply multi Ora
[03:32:28] reaction happen when you have a multi AA
[03:32:31] on the enemy and you finally apply a
[03:32:33] third element on top to do a reaction
[03:32:35] reacting against the multi Aura in this
[03:32:37] example here we have electrocharge with
[03:32:39] electrod and hydro and family we apply
[03:32:41] power on top to do a multi Ora reaction
[03:32:44] of course keep in mind that each element
[03:32:45] here has an own Elemental gauge so for
[03:32:48] example Electro could have let's say 1.5
[03:32:50] unit of Electro gauge Hydro here could
[03:32:52] have two unit of hydro gauges and fin
[03:32:55] will apply pyro which in either one unit
[03:32:58] as a weak pyro or two unit or strong
[03:33:00] pyro let's look at an example where we
[03:33:02] apply two unit of strong pyro onto the
[03:33:05] multi AA with Electro and hydro where we
[03:33:07] do two unit of strong Pyro from a banded
[03:33:09] Elemental skill for ex example onto 1.5
[03:33:12] unit of electrod as well as two unit of
[03:33:14] hydro
[03:33:15] and of course it will trigger overload
[03:33:17] and P price as you seriously seen at the
[03:33:19] example but what a lot of people don't
[03:33:21] understand is that these reaction are
[03:33:23] not triggered simultaneously but rather
[03:33:25] one after the other based on a priority
[03:33:28] list enganging impact element are
[03:33:30] reacted based on a priority list
[03:33:31] starting from electros to pyro anemo
[03:33:34] cryo freeze which we like to talk about
[03:33:37] hydro dandro and then Geo in this case
[03:33:39] because Electro have higher priority of
[03:33:41] hydro pyro will first react with this
[03:33:44] 1.5 unit of Electro first to trigger
[03:33:46] overload before it interact with the
[03:33:48] hydro to dink her vaporize and of course
[03:33:50] the elemental gauge get subtract
[03:33:52] accordingly so in this practical example
[03:33:54] what will actually happen is that two
[03:33:56] unit of pyro will first go ahead and
[03:33:59] react with a 1.5 unit of Electro this
[03:34:01] will reduce the electro gauge to zero as
[03:34:04] well as reducing the Pyro gauge to 0.5
[03:34:07] unit and of course this right here will
[03:34:09] react and trigger a over
[03:34:11] so that's okay I mean I guess I knew
[03:34:14] this cuz this is why fridge works so
[03:34:15] fridge works because there's uh dendro
[03:34:18] and C for some reason drro and cryo oras
[03:34:20] can coexist even though there's no
[03:34:22] [ __ ] reaction so when you freeze the
[03:34:24] hydro like you eat some of the hydro
[03:34:26] from the first from like the bloom and
[03:34:27] then it goes to freeze uh or vice versa
[03:34:30] the [ __ ] priority order is cryo first
[03:34:31] so it should be Freeze first and then
[03:34:33] you bloom so you effectively get more
[03:34:34] blooms per Hydra app right that's how it
[03:34:36] works I knew that but I didn't realize
[03:34:39] it also worked for electrom manif I mean
[03:34:41] thunder manif so for Thunder manif it
[03:34:43] should because your uh Electro [ __ ]
[03:34:46] gauge is like
[03:34:47] 9,99 how much is this like 99 how much U
[03:34:50] is on it's like infinite so I guess it
[03:34:52] it will never go to the hydro what's the
[03:34:54] priority list for
[03:34:56] this yeah it is it is a
[03:34:59] crow overload before it interact with
[03:35:02] the
[03:35:02] H and of course the elemental gauge get
[03:35:05] subtract accordingly this practical
[03:35:08] example what will actually happen is
[03:35:10] that two unit of pyro will first go
[03:35:12] ahead and react with a 1.5 unit of
[03:35:15] Electro this will reduce the electro
[03:35:17] gauge to zero as well as reducing the
[03:35:19] Pyro gauge to 0.5 units and then of
[03:35:22] course this right here will react and
[03:35:23] trigger a overload however as we have
[03:35:25] 0.5 unit of P remaining this remaining
[03:35:29] 0.5 unit will go ahead and interact with
[03:35:31] the hydro AA on the enemy as well and
[03:35:34] this here trigger vaporize and this is
[03:35:37] the reason why you see both overload and
[03:35:39] vaporize being triggered is because the
[03:35:41] Pyro first react with electros and then
[03:35:44] there's still some pyro remain which
[03:35:46] allow you to further react with the
[03:35:48] hydro trigger yeah yeah like I I I knew
[03:35:50] this [ __ ] for like normal enemies but I
[03:35:52] didn't like make the brain connection
[03:35:54] for [ __ ] sing a weak pyro guess that
[03:35:56] makes sense so if if [ __ ] anemo
[03:35:59] wase or if Hydro was higher than Electro
[03:36:01] it would be fine but it's
[03:36:03] not in this case we example showcase
[03:36:08] and and only over trigger multi- AA as
[03:36:12] well as multi AA reaction happen in all
[03:36:14] shape and form in genin Impact another
[03:36:16] different example would be Frozen where
[03:36:18] you can trigger a freeze engageing
[03:36:21] impact by applying cryo and a hydro onto
[03:36:23] the same enemy when you perform a freeze
[03:36:26] reaction something very special happened
[03:36:28] which is a hidden Aura the cryo and
[03:36:30] hydro can actually coexist as a multi-
[03:36:33] aura however they will simply be hidden
[03:36:34] underneath the brand new Ora which is
[03:36:36] Freeze in genjin Impact freeze has
[03:36:39] actually its own aura where it pretty
[03:36:41] much behaved like a crowd or except
[03:36:43] allow to do things like shatters in this
[03:36:45] case the freeze or will hide the Rio and
[03:36:48] the hydro Ora underneath and they
[03:36:51] become wait is it the viability of the
[03:36:55] reaction and so this is a very quick in
[03:36:58] cryo and AA could simply be hidden
[03:37:00] underneath the brand new or which is
[03:37:02] freeze engageing impact or except allow
[03:37:05] case the freeze Ora will hide the Rio
[03:37:08] and the hydro Ora underneath and they
[03:37:10] become become untractable until the
[03:37:12] freeze is removed however these free
[03:37:14] element actually coexist at the same
[03:37:17] time and they will all be deated at the
[03:37:19] same
[03:37:19] time it is possible to do a reaction
[03:37:23] assuming you can freely customize your
[03:37:25] gauge so what will happen if we do a
[03:37:27] pyro attack here is that the Pyro can
[03:37:29] first come in to remove the freeze Aura
[03:37:31] interacting with this and then this
[03:37:34] expose the hydro and the cryo Z what if
[03:37:37] the thunder man if doesn't have infinite
[03:37:39] Electro gauge but has 99 U and then when
[03:37:42] they release the Pyro archon she'll
[03:37:44] apply 100 U so you can actually remove
[03:37:56] it so I need to learn up on some genin
[03:37:59] the AA
[03:38:01] underneath cuz I know how auras work and
[03:38:03] how fridge works and and burning and
[03:38:05] [ __ ] but I didn't my brain didn't like
[03:38:08] associate it with like H uh swi the
[03:38:11] [ __ ] swirling the Thunder
[03:38:14] manff like this part the like priority
[03:38:17] list which is why I assume if this makes
[03:38:20] sense I assume you can just swirl
[03:38:22] Electro on the [ __ ] Hydro dude but
[03:38:24] not Hydro on the electro
[03:38:28] dude what is what it is well not is what
[03:38:31] it is good to
[03:38:39] know okay I have to do
[03:38:43] weeklys
[03:38:46] wo it's not even true um are you
[03:38:48] roasting ten0 or
[03:38:54] me I watched your video on on itge I
[03:38:58] have like a like I feel like I have a
[03:38:59] decent understanding of how most of it
[03:39:01] works I just don't know how the well I
[03:39:03] didn't now I do I think everyone's never
[03:39:06] I just didn't know how uh the thunder
[03:39:07] man if stuff worked like I know you can
[03:39:09] self swirl the Gene and all that stuff
[03:39:11] but I wasn't sure if you could uh if you
[03:39:14] swirled with two elements coexisted if
[03:39:16] it would always just swirl
[03:39:23] Electro who do I want to play I need
[03:39:26] friendship on someone what if I do Navia
[03:39:28] actually we already have a Navia what if
[03:39:29] I do who's a new let's do rizzly no my
[03:39:33] rizzly kind of sucks
[03:39:35] um okay I'll carry fine I'll do it
[03:39:38] myself fine I'll do it myself
[03:39:49] [Music]
[03:40:04] hello yo what the [ __ ] why did Joe Biden
[03:40:08] tweet this leave it to the
[03:40:13] president oh [ __ ] I'm
[03:40:15] dying yo what is
[03:40:19] happening do I have a Healer I
[03:40:31] do no not
[03:40:34] me okay we lost
[03:40:36] Navia leave it to the
[03:40:39] president
[03:40:40] prepare to die
[03:40:47] fool I don't really want to use my
[03:40:52] [Music]
[03:41:03] ALT no I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead I'm
[03:41:06] fine good damage good

[03:42:21] is Yo Yo never oh nice thank you all
[03:42:24] right you got it I'm going to
[03:42:26] preemptively I was going to lament

[03:42:46] worthless
[03:42:48] usess hello
[03:42:55] nice
[03:42:59] nice please three mats
[03:43:03] finally we never get three oh I mean we
[03:43:05] don't want to crit on instructor
[03:43:06] characters but hey I'm going to lock
[03:43:08] that maybe fav yugu uh that sucks that
[03:43:11] also sucks two mats only unlucky but uh
[03:43:13] it's
[03:43:15] fine unlucky let me play background
[03:43:19] music is your Shan full em Yes actually
[03:43:22] don't talk to
[03:43:24] me I just realized what you're
[03:43:26] implying uh okay I'm ready all right
[03:43:29] next what I'm going to
[03:43:32] do is uh we're going to do the
[03:43:36] apep I think do weekly
[03:43:44] I pull Yi or Nev meta wise probably Nev
[03:43:47] but both are
[03:43:51] good new villet very
[03:44:08] broken
[03:44:14] [ __ ] it I'll solo it I'll do it
[03:44:18] myself we have 17 minutes to do all
[03:44:21] weekly but we still have
[03:44:26] time this do the vent on stream I
[03:44:38] might
[03:44:42] strike strike a
[03:44:47] pose
[03:44:51] okay wow I don't even need to sh out
[03:44:54] here I don't need
[03:45:07] to have fun with this
[03:45:15] [ __ ] I freed I mean I looking far is
[03:45:18] that Al too
[03:45:22] early disappear plays the Freo the free
[03:45:25] to play option yeah you can use
[03:45:38] benit
[03:45:45] it's always good C6 abuser dude I use it
[03:45:48] once if you're going to say C Shia
[03:45:51] anytime I do something bad when I'm not
[03:45:53] even using it I might as well use it
[03:45:55] from time to
[03:45:57] time
[03:46:00] useless
[03:46:03] sorry my burst is raring off can you go
[03:46:05] faster thank
[03:46:08] you dude C4 has not saved me once maybe
[03:46:12] like in my whole life playing sh C4
[03:46:15] probably saved me like one
[03:46:19] time okay okay okay okay no meme though
[03:46:22] meme aside I actually I'm dead here by
[03:46:25] the way uh
[03:46:30] me I wanted to see what happened mem
[03:46:33] aside I think no player in the world has
[03:46:37] gotten more value out of uh C4 show than
[03:46:40] I have dude that defense goes
[03:46:46] crazy only two mats on every boss in the
[03:46:49] game okay double crit uh instructor's
[03:46:52] cap we love to see it uh anemo goblet on
[03:46:55] instructor before Vermillion that sucks
[03:46:57] and that
[03:47:02] sucks
[03:47:07] unlucky youu get him
[03:47:13] uh I have resin still right I'm pretty
[03:47:14] sure I have con okay let's just go do
[03:47:17] artifacts whoa I love artifacts bad
[03:47:28] [Music]
[03:47:36] chest Mr socks cats or dogs dogs I think
[03:47:40] both are cool I'm a I'm probably more of
[03:47:42] a dog person I feel like they feel like
[03:47:44] you're they're like I feel like dogs are
[03:47:45] more your friend you
[03:47:47] know also every guy I've ever met that
[03:47:50] has a cat is a [ __ ] boy so I I stay like
[03:47:54] I mean I like cats they're cool
[03:47:58] but oh I I'm not even joking by the
[03:48:03] way my bad I guess yep
[03:48:08] sorry wait I B I was in my animation I
[03:48:16] pressed time to dude you saw the
[03:48:19] animation right I was literally in the
[03:48:22] animation all right just cuz you're
[03:48:24] making fun of me I'm using my C6 [ __ ]
[03:48:26] you I will use my whale Powers wait
[03:48:28] actually let me group them up this is
[03:48:29] optimal sh gameplay watch this you do
[03:48:31] this then you do
[03:48:34] a I jumped to I jumped to I jumped to
[03:48:36] run it back run back back I meant to
[03:48:38] like short jump jump I tried to like
[03:48:40] space e but my keyboard
[03:48:43] uh I don't know I [ __ ] up the
[03:48:45] timing let's go
[03:48:56] here maybe if you used Alam you wouldn't
[03:48:59] struggle I didn't struggle I just shun
[03:49:08] died
[03:49:10] you know what maybe you're right maybe I
[03:49:11] do need the zff elemental guide let me
[03:49:15] pull this up hello beautiful people and
[03:49:18] welcome to three levels of Elemental
[03:49:20] reactions from new player how old is
[03:49:22] this oh my God you didn't have a face
[03:49:24] cam back here to the strongest
[03:49:26] situational artifact oh [ __ ]
[03:49:28] I the four piece set gives you 40% crit
[03:49:32] rate against Frozen enemies which is an
[03:49:34] insane amount you have one for you Ora
[03:49:36] and it's on a burst it's not really
[03:49:38] practical to do any combos with it
[03:49:41] there's one thing you have to keep in
[03:49:42] mind when you're trying to trigger
[03:49:44] multiple reactions without reapplying
[03:49:46] the aura and that is that the elemental
[03:49:48] gauge of strength goes down over time
[03:49:51] that means that if you wait long enough
[03:49:53] after applying a 2u aura a one you
[03:49:55] trigger will remove it technically the
[03:49:58] Decay rate isn't exactly linear but we
[03:50:00] can use an approximation of course it
[03:50:02] isn't it's [ __ ]
[03:50:03] gention
[03:50:05] whether with pyro will divide the amount
[03:50:08] this is years ago to be fair this is a
[03:50:10] new one hello beautiful people and
[03:50:12] welcome he's so much more soothing
[03:50:14] now I feel like I did the opposite the
[03:50:17] longer it'll last but as a general rule
[03:50:19] it really doesn't last all that long I
[03:50:22] have never seen what the [ __ ] I've known
[03:50:24] Z Jeff for like 10 years I have never
[03:50:26] seen him with glasses I didn't even know
[03:50:28] he owned
[03:50:29] glasses to reapply dend relatively often
[03:50:32] a really good way to visualize this is
[03:50:34] that it's kind of like adding wood to a
[03:50:36] fire you keep your fire burning and in
[03:50:39] order to keep blooms you trigger that
[03:50:41] being I I I definitely watched this
[03:50:43] video so I guess I just forgot it's a
[03:50:44] prop I guess it ISO that you have is to
[03:50:46] just let them expire and explode the
[03:50:48] other choice that you have is to hit
[03:50:51] them with either pyro or Electro attacks
[03:50:53] and hitting those seeds with either pyro
[03:50:55] or Electro is going to trigger a sub
[03:50:57] reaction respectively
[03:51:00] virgin well
[03:51:05] anyways this makes me feel old it's only
[03:51:07] a year
[03:51:15] no the only thing I don't like is
[03:51:20] um I don't know should we talk about
[03:51:22] this today fine I really hate it when
[03:51:24] people spread misinformation especially
[03:51:26] for a gacha game because you're going to
[03:51:27] spend money well people spend money and
[03:51:30] this one content creator said does it
[03:51:32] for Theo reactions a little bit of a
[03:51:34] summary is that burning is not burning
[03:51:37] is not great and like yeah
[03:51:39] yeah when dendo came out it wasn't but
[03:51:41] as soon as we get the burning kery DEA
[03:51:44] who's going to apply so much pyro and
[03:51:46] she's going to have a kit we already
[03:51:47] know this that's going to synergize well
[03:51:49] with burning this is straight up just
[03:51:51] not going to be true so when de comes
[03:51:53] out this is flat misinformation uh maybe
[03:51:55] AR Lino too uh just saying so uh clear
[03:51:58] burning will be meta mark my word but
[03:52:00] it's going to be a buron burning carry
[03:52:02] and then the reactions will be
[03:52:05] revitalized it will no longer be a hyper
[03:52:08] bloom uh uh uh meta
[03:52:15] game just just trust me on this
[03:52:18] one pyro traveler will be broken true
[03:52:21] dude I wish we got a hydro
[03:52:23] traveler it's actually crazy that they
[03:52:25] just skipped that one element for some
[03:52:27] reason [ __ ] lumine lumine and ather
[03:52:30] they went to whichever one you picked
[03:52:32] [ __ ] went to Fontana and just didn't
[03:52:33] imbue with
[03:52:34] Hydro they stayed dendro for some reason
[03:52:38] that was crazy
[03:52:42] boom unlucky o crit damage but I mean
[03:52:46] could roll
[03:52:49] attack water gun
[03:52:52] true dead drum Z was so good man well is
[03:52:55] still good but so much
[03:52:58] [Applause]
[03:53:04] better useless
[03:53:06] [Applause]
[03:53:07] disappear
[03:53:10] dude I actually hate being cryo Ora
[03:53:12] you're [ __ ] so slow Hydro one's worse
[03:53:14] don't get me wrong but
[03:53:18] Oops
[03:53:20] usess why you wasting friendship I'm
[03:53:22] sorry I just missed TR I wish you could
[03:53:25] dude you should it should let you know
[03:53:27] your like friendship points like you
[03:53:29] know like leag has like Mastery there
[03:53:31] should be like a point system where it
[03:53:32] shows you how many like friendship
[03:53:34] points you have with the character past
[03:53:37] 10
[03:53:39] [Music]
[03:53:44] okay let me play my friendship
[03:53:47] team
[03:53:48] rizzly uh
[03:53:51] Navia
[03:53:55] and where's the American I'll play ging
[03:53:58] actually no where's the
[03:54:01] American there is yeah I'll do my best
[03:54:04] but I can't guarantee a
[03:54:07] victory
[03:54:12] what are you doing here not vermilion we
[03:54:14] strong box Vermilion now cuz it's in the
[03:54:16] strong box so we might as well do a
[03:54:18] domain that doesn't have echo in
[03:54:22] it fun fact if we strong box the okay
[03:54:26] let's say you do a good domain and you
[03:54:28] strong box both like both sets for
[03:54:30] Vermilion that's two two Vermilion
[03:54:33] instead of just one if you do the
[03:54:34] Vermilion domain you get Vermilion half
[03:54:36] the time whereas if you do another
[03:54:37] domain you get Vermilion 100% of time
[03:54:39] cuz you strong box it now if you do
[03:54:40] Vermilion and you strong box Vermillion
[03:54:42] that's 150% Vermilion because you get
[03:54:45] Vermillion or you strongbox Vermillion
[03:54:47] so technically it is more optimal to do
[03:54:50] Vermillion and strongbox Vermillion but
[03:54:51] I don't recommend doing
[03:54:57] that true pause trap unlucky pause trap
[03:55:03] unlucky okay let me change for list
[03:55:06] actually yeah let me change forist
[03:55:13] what if I just looped
