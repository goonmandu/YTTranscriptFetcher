[00:11:33] welcome to the stream I was going to
[00:11:34] stream yesterday I showered yesterday
[00:11:36] got ready I was going to stream but I
[00:11:37] had McDonald's and then I worked out
[00:11:39] then I had McDonald's and then I was
[00:11:41] like dead so I like passed out and I
[00:11:42] fell asleep it is what it
[00:11:48] is sorry I'm
[00:11:51] sorry anyways so it is what it is uh
[00:11:54] today we're going to stream I was going
[00:11:54] to stream
[00:11:57] early I was going to stream early now
[00:11:59] the reason why I didn't stream early
[00:12:02] was because I recorded for an hour and
[00:12:05] 30 minutes in one take a whole video
[00:12:08] that's going to be out probably
[00:12:09] tomorrow which
[00:12:13] is I reviewed my own account whoa fogers
[00:12:16] no one cares literally no one but it was
[00:12:18] long it was dude it was
[00:12:22] long it was dude I was like 30 minutes
[00:12:26] in and I'm like wait I did nothing so
[00:12:29] I recorded okay but we have to talk
[00:12:30] about this though so first of all this
[00:12:32] is an hour and 20 minutes and one take
[00:12:33] right second of all I recorded it with
[00:12:36] my cam cuz I felt like it would be
[00:12:38] better if I just like had it on I talk I
[00:12:40] don't normally do that just like talk
[00:12:41] for like one take and don't really edit
[00:12:43] it
[00:12:44] much dude gen's threeyear anniversary
[00:12:46] might as well have the 3 three three
[00:12:49] threeyear account review what it looks
[00:12:52] like as someone who been playing since
[00:12:54] 1.0 now that's one two is you
[00:12:58] [ __ ] ERS in chat and you know
[00:12:59] who I'm talking about so okay I stream
[00:13:04] this on my I usually record with a
[00:13:06] different OBS than I stream on but for
[00:13:09] this one I recorded on my normal OBS but
[00:13:11] I also recorded on my stream overlay
[00:13:12] because I said adding the cam would be
[00:13:13] cool however I forgot to turn off
[00:13:16] offline chat which isn't a big deal cuz
[00:13:18] I wasn't live so surely there's nothing
[00:13:21] but upon looking at the uh footage you
[00:13:23] will notice that throughout the entire 1
[00:13:26] hour and 20 minute video there are dumb
[00:13:28] users in the offline chat no disrespect
[00:13:30] no disrespect I just say it like it is
[00:13:33] typing whatever the [ __ ] this emote is I
[00:13:36] got The Honky startle in four offline
[00:13:39] Chatters mod check and then you like
[00:13:40] skip forward it's just the same [ __ ] cuz
[00:13:42] no one's an offline chat and then
[00:13:43] there's some wide Cocos there's uh
[00:13:46] people arrive and sit any plinker plink
[00:13:49] uh and you know there's like a
[00:13:51] discussion about Elden ring so I uh yeah
[00:13:54] so I guess that's in the video now uh
[00:13:57] now granted I was talking nonstop for an
[00:14:00] hour 20 no Cuts like literally me
[00:14:03] talking onstop so my throat hurt and it
[00:14:05] felt like I streamed for an hour and a
[00:14:07] half and I'm streaming again which is
[00:14:08] also why I was like tired it is what I'm
[00:14:10] kind of tired it is what it
[00:14:13] is basically streamed twice I could have
[00:14:16] done it live but then you guys would
[00:14:17] have been I would have gotten like
[00:14:19] distracted by chat and then you would I
[00:14:20] would have been out of my
[00:14:25] element what is this ego reviewing your
[00:14:27] own account yes

[00:17:15] too so it shouldn't hurt my schedule but
[00:17:17] it'll be sometime like 13 145 then
[00:17:20] apparently there's [ __ ] twitchcon the
[00:17:21] weekend after or is it the same I didn't
[00:17:24] book
[00:17:25] anything so yeah I'm going to try to do
[00:17:27] as much as I can but like this month is
[00:17:29] kind of [ __ ] so I don't know where I'm
[00:17:31] going to be half the time but just keep
[00:17:33] that in mind like for now it's
[00:17:35] fine but I'm going to make sure I do the
[00:17:38] account reviews this weekend like
[00:17:40] hopefully Sunday and then other stuff
[00:17:43] soon and then yeah so cuz I have a lot
[00:17:46] of plans but yeah also I okay I might
[00:17:48] get another editor too cuz the current
[00:17:49] ones I have are goated but I'm still
[00:17:51] backlogged
[00:17:53] cuz you can't rush perfection I guess
[00:17:56] but I also need more so I I I can't I
[00:17:59] can't function when I can't record
[00:18:01] anything cuz when I record it it's going
[00:18:03] to be too late also I'm stupid and I
[00:18:05] don't upload things unless they're
[00:18:06] perfect marai gig chat the thing with
[00:18:08] Mari is he's so good that he's like
[00:18:10] better than he he like I might give him
[00:18:13] main Channel videos it's just that he's
[00:18:15] so good that I don't want to ruin the
[00:18:16] second Channel like I don't want to give
[00:18:18] him more because if I give him more then
[00:18:19] he can't do stuff on the second I don't
[00:18:21] know I haven't decided we'll see what
[00:18:24] happens uh I have a whole video of the
[00:18:27] Fang doing the abyss but I think I'm
[00:18:30] going to Second Channel it cuz I don't
[00:18:31] think it's good enough for my main
[00:18:31] Channel not cuz the editing is not good
[00:18:32] enough but because I think actually the
[00:18:34] main thing is the bit rate cuz I think I
[00:18:37] offed my bit rate since then and the
[00:18:38] abyss quality was so bad that like it
[00:18:40] actually is like dude it's not my fault
[00:18:43] but I think I kind of want to Second
[00:18:44] Channel it there's a few modifications I
[00:18:45] would do but apparently we deleted the
[00:18:47] file cuz no storage so I'm just going to
[00:18:49] Second Channel it it's fine so you hate
[00:18:51] me
[00:18:52] [Laughter]
[00:18:55] dude Fang I didn't even know you wanted
[00:18:57] on the main Channel you didn't didn't
[00:18:58] say
[00:18:59] anything I think it's cuz the [ __ ] uh
[00:19:01] um the the the bit rate is dog
[00:19:04] [ __ ] I mean I could main Channel it so
[00:19:07] I'm not worth
[00:19:10] main you um are worth more than the main
[00:19:18] Channel see uh uh two y actually uh is
[00:19:22] where my favorite videos
[00:19:27] go
[00:19:30] anyways I haven't decided yet we can
[00:19:31] figure that out I don't really care
[00:19:32] either way like I'm fine with either
[00:19:34] we'll figure it out uh other than that I
[00:19:36] have
[00:19:38] to I think that's mostly it I can shut
[00:19:40] up now but I might find one more Editor
[00:19:42] to help cuz right now have like two part
[00:19:44] three part time ones but yeah we'll
[00:19:47] see just it's not necessarily that I
[00:19:49] have I don't know I need to figure it
[00:19:51] out but yeah so that's the intro Let Me
[00:19:54] swap cams and then we could do all this
[00:19:56] stuff that I have up in
[00:20:21] where the [ __ ] is my

[00:42:50] man I guess we get okay last time one of
[00:42:53] the times it was cinnamon and the way we

[00:42:57] close to was flavors so it could be like
[00:42:59] vanilla chocolate or strawberry but I
[00:43:00] don't think so cuz why would they be
[00:43:02] close like vanilla is not close to any I
[00:43:04] gu ah it might be vanilla it might be
[00:43:06] yeah it's [ __ ] vanilla dude but I
[00:43:10] thought vanilla is more it's not like
[00:43:13] Swiss why is lemon I guess it makes
[00:43:15] sense
[00:43:21] whatever vanilla is a spice no it's a
[00:43:25] bean

[00:44:50] happen or Ian the hunt guy with like the
[00:44:55] traveling with you you has stirred up my
[00:44:58] curiosity what drove you to pick up the
[00:45:01] sword at such a young
[00:45:03] age well I suppose there's no harm in
[00:45:06] telling you oh no at first it was the
[00:45:08] General stories about the previous sword
[00:45:11] Champion rib told me about her
[00:45:13] unparalleled skills her unmatched
[00:45:15] prowess with a single blade it inspired
[00:45:18] me that one day I could earn the title
[00:45:20] myself dude she's so sick look at
[00:45:23] this it's l not Ian nope it's Ian
[00:45:26] so it was the Allure of
[00:45:30] renown I also wanted to live up to the
[00:45:32] General's expectations and repay him for
[00:45:34] the gift of his teachings where would I
[00:45:37] be without him uh yanang I don't know
[00:45:39] what you would be without him but I know
[00:45:41] what you're going to be without him
[00:45:43] after you kill
[00:45:44] him then you wish to forge deeper ties
[00:45:48] give it a few years more than that one
[00:45:50] day I'll run into battle alongside my
[00:45:52] cloud Knight comrades defending the lawu
[00:45:55] and striking down those who threatened
[00:45:56] us putting my abilities to their
[00:45:58] rightful
[00:46:01] use in the end it all comes back to
[00:46:06] fty what's with all the questions Miss
[00:46:09] why did you choose the path of the sword
[00:46:12] the sword chose me I was once Shackled
[00:46:15] by Fame and Fortune impeded by
[00:46:19] loyalty but in the end the sword moves
[00:46:22] Beyond such
[00:46:24] Notions
[00:46:26] for the sword is just a sword an
[00:46:29] instrument determining life and death
[00:46:32] nothing can tarnish its
[00:46:38] [Music]
[00:46:43] Essence only when you've walked the
[00:46:45] fiery Trail and cut through every
[00:46:48] impediment can you understand the
[00:46:50] purpose behind every swing of your
[00:46:52] [Music]

[00:55:27] uh it might take a little bit there
[00:55:28] might be uh a little [ __ ] that we have
[00:55:30] to do but you know what they say in life
[00:55:33] there's ups and downs and
[00:55:36] um sometimes you got to you know do what
[00:55:40] you got to do also I saw that there was
[00:55:42] like a boss somewhere around here that
[00:55:44] gives an achievement I just like saw

[00:56:26] years of gion looks like it's going to
[00:56:27] be like an hour video I don't know if

[00:56:29] to just hear me talking and showing all
[00:56:31] my builds and my characters and my
[00:56:33] thought process and what I want to do
[00:56:34] for an hour straight basically like a
[00:56:35] live stream it'll be on my main channel
[00:56:37] so there you go I won't Okay cool so

[00:57:40] actual team wait wait wait wait chill

[00:57:48] know if she's hard or not I just know
[00:57:49] it's a boss that's all
[00:57:52] um one second
[00:57:59] okay we're good what team should I play
[00:58:01] Let's Play net with
[00:58:03] uh
[00:58:09] Dia oh Chad I saw dude I saw Z Jeff
[00:58:12] actually let's talk about this before we
[00:58:13] before we before we start I saw Z
[00:58:16] Jeff let me open my own my own Zio
[00:58:20] nette aware no it's something
[00:58:23] bad
[00:58:26] let me make sure I don't put any leaks
[00:58:28] because I don't look at leaks yeah I saw
[00:58:30] Z Jeff talking about how he finally
[00:58:31] found a team where DEA feels good which
[00:58:33] is uh the net hyper Bloom team where you
[00:58:35] also have a DEA that gets some virgins
[00:58:37] can go instructor or if you're not a
[00:58:40] weird person Guild the dreams and get
[00:58:41] some Burgin but instructor cuz you can
[00:58:43] bu your team ZM and then also uh get an
[00:58:46] extra Vape on like your burst give neet
[00:58:49] his fourth passive talent and give you
[00:58:50] Interruption resistance which nevet
[00:58:52] mostly needs at the start of his
[00:58:53] rotation now you know je was talking
[00:58:55] about that uh and then you know he he
[00:58:57] fought some people in the replies that
[00:58:58] were like oh this person called that you
[00:59:00] know de was good right probably
[00:59:04] uh yeah if I click here there's probably
[00:59:07] going to be a reply that's
[00:59:09] like that's not true she's quite good
[00:59:11] and useful anyways it is what it is uh
[00:59:14] we're not going to talk about it cuz
[00:59:15] there's no reason for me to talk about
[00:59:16] it right I can sit back with my popcorn
[00:59:18] not get involved and then both sides are
[00:59:20] I'm I'm I'm a neutral party who cares it
[00:59:22] is what it is anyways the the real
[00:59:24] winner in this whole situation isn't the
[00:59:26] person that said in [ __ ] patch threo
[00:59:28] whenever the [ __ ] she came out that she
[00:59:30] was going to be good copium or the
[00:59:32] person that saying she's a God now or
[00:59:34] the person that's saying she's bad it's
[00:59:35] me why is it me oh oh oh oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]
[00:59:40] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] is this wait but why is
[00:59:43] fish you're supposed to be riding but is
[00:59:45] this basic essential team shown in my
[00:59:48] video before this was discovered oh [ __ ]
[00:59:50] wait surely I put but I mentioned Ryden
[00:59:52] though I literally talked about Ryden
[00:59:53] look look look I said R was better than
[00:59:55] cookie look you will pair him with a
[00:59:57] dend option Nita being the best one but
[00:59:59] you can use other options like dendro
[01:00:00] traveler and then an electro hyper
[01:00:02] Bloomer who can proc all of your C
[01:00:05] field full Elemental Mastery ridden but
[01:00:07] you can obviously also use that are out
[01:00:10] on field in order to thought here is
[01:00:11] very orible with my personal
[01:00:13] recommendation being either a shield
[01:00:14] like Jong Lee an electro like fishal bet
[01:00:16] or Yi or another dendro or Hydro option
[01:00:19] you can also play buron with net true
[01:00:22] and while you can't because again Toma
[01:00:24] relies on normal attacking I would
[01:00:26] typically recommend a pyro character
[01:00:27] like de or Shang Ling while de's field
[01:00:30] time isn't the best she doesn't have the
[01:00:31] most up time on her field you can also
[01:00:33] run an electro character who can get
[01:00:35] occasional hyper blooms you can
[01:00:37] do he's a genius he's just a genius
[01:00:39] cookie if you want to hyper Bloom and
[01:00:41] buron kind of mix and match both of them
[01:00:43] he's just he's just so geniosity that
[01:00:46] should be my name
[01:00:49] anyways true but the the thing that I
[01:00:51] didn't know the thing that added on to
[01:00:55] like the list of advantages that I had
[01:00:56] thought of was cuz my thought was just
[01:00:59] okay you have fire now so a pyro as well
[01:01:01] so a fourth element for uh the
[01:01:04] last um SW type Shang is a terrible
[01:01:07] character that's bait I'm not going to
[01:01:08] respond to it uh for the last stack of
[01:01:09] this which is pretty good also the
[01:01:11] interruption uh resistance and uh you
[01:01:14] could run a uh like you get free
[01:01:16] burgeons and that's like mostly it the
[01:01:19] main thing I forgot was that you also
[01:01:21] obviously you get Vape which is the
[01:01:22] other Hydro reaction forgot you can
[01:01:24] actually
[01:01:25] organize your rotation to vape your
[01:01:26] burst which is some more damage so
[01:01:27] that's a bonus that was an extra bonus
[01:01:30] from what I thought of um but obviously
[01:01:32] it makes sense you just get you can Vape
[01:01:33] reverse but yeah and uh that the even
[01:01:36] though the field up time is kind of dog
[01:01:38] [ __ ] the resistance Interruption mostly
[01:01:41] matters at the start cuz after a while
[01:01:43] you can be further from the enemies
[01:01:44] which
[01:01:48] yeah Shang benit at the back of the soup
[01:01:50] line okay what about Hut Shang Ling
[01:01:53] yolan Singo it chars High higher DPS

[01:02:35] playing dude all I'm saying all imagine
[01:02:39] if Shang Ling looked like Ryden imagine
[01:02:41] if all I'm saying is imagine if they
[01:02:43] just deleted Shang Ling and they gave
[01:02:45] her kit to like [ __ ] I don't know to
[01:02:48] like I mean BET's already broken but

[01:08:48] deepwood because you're probably going
[01:08:49] to be proing Bloom probably hyper bloom
[01:08:51] or buron which uh are dendro damage
[01:08:55] dealing reactions so you might as well
[01:08:56] go deep the only time you don't want to
[01:08:58] go deep with a dendro character unless
[01:09:00] you already have one on your team is if
[01:09:02] you're doing if the only Dental reaction
[01:09:03] you're proing is aggravate which is
[01:09:05] technically an electro reaction but it's
[01:09:08] like on Quicken and quickens dendro so
[01:09:10] you know what I mean but
[01:09:18] yeah real gr gr gr gr gr GR
[01:09:27] sock is BYU good yeah he's like uh he's

[01:09:42] I cleared the abyss without my mouse uh

[01:09:47] better because I could roll around with
[01:09:49] my w ASD keys and not use my

[01:15:48] a wait for
[01:15:50] it at least nevet looks like this and
[01:15:54] that is
[01:15:57] satisfying uh okay I do think wait what
[01:16:00] were we talking about I was talking
[01:16:01] about something and I got I was talking
[01:16:02] about something that someone wrote Oh
[01:16:04] answer my question and now I forgot what
[01:16:06] was I talking
[01:16:07] about oh yeah in my hour and 20 minute
[01:16:10] you Jill thanks for four mons I
[01:16:11] appreciate you uh uh uh uh uh uh I
[01:16:14] noticed I came to the realization two
[01:16:16] things Mar H pieces one two things for
[01:16:20] sure one thing for certain [ __ ] is he
[01:16:23] saying one is that when I gear all of my
[01:16:26] characters and I mean all of my
[01:16:28] characters are
[01:16:29] geared I realize that I don't have
[01:16:32] enough emblem of ser fate I need emblem
[01:16:34] on Ryden Shang Ling B
[01:16:38] Singo S I said that perfectly Singo um
[01:16:43] [ __ ] yolan that's five
[01:16:46] [ __ ] Thomas maybe I need it on Kaa
[01:16:49] reverse melt Rosaria reverse melt
[01:16:51] [ __ ] others it is what it is right I
[01:16:53] need a lot of characters I don't have
[01:16:55] enough so we need to farm more emblem
[01:16:57] and
[01:16:59] ideally we do a strong box session soon
[01:17:02] I have a lot of five star artifacts that
[01:17:04] are that are chilling Bing chilling we
[01:17:06] should do it surely I don't do for
[01:17:08] million again ha so yeah also I need to
[01:17:11] level more weapons now off stream I
[01:17:15] leveled one
[01:17:17] weapon which was my second Skyward heart
[01:17:21] now granted it's only level 70
[01:17:24] I know but it's a start because we don't
[01:17:27] have so here's what I noticed you look
[01:17:29] at my polearm
[01:17:30] characters I have a lot of polar Arms 1
[01:17:33] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 n and a half that are
[01:17:37] Level uh 90 and then this one I can also
[01:17:39] use like 10
[01:17:41] right but you look oh also you look at
[01:17:44] my sword characters again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[01:17:47] 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 almost 17 level
[01:17:52] swords what the [ __ ] is wrong with me
[01:17:54] but then you look at [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:17:56] [ __ ] bows there's only like seven 1 2
[01:17:59] 3 4 5 6 I leveled this today six what
[01:18:04] come possible you look at [ __ ]
[01:18:06] catalysts there's like five six a lot of
[01:18:09] thrilling Tales but still so I've
[01:18:11] noticed same with Claymores my pole arms
[01:18:13] and swords are really good the other
[01:18:14] weapons I need to level more because
[01:18:16] when I was doing like reviewing all my
[01:18:17] characters it's like you look at my
[01:18:19] [ __ ] like my f he's sharing a weapon
[01:18:23] with my EO who's sharing a weapon with
[01:18:25] my [ __ ] Ula who's on the level 91
[01:18:27] right now so it's like I need more
[01:18:29] weapons to
[01:18:31] level you recommend crit attack over em
[01:18:33] for venti no for most people I recommend
[01:18:35] em very high investment especially with
[01:18:36] Bennett with harp crit can be better but
[01:18:38] you have to be super high investment
[01:18:40] usually they're about the same em is
[01:18:41] more accessible I play crit because I
[01:18:43] have spare artifacts lying around and I
[01:18:44] have harp and Bennett anyways um um um
[01:18:48] um um um um okay the thing is I I don't
[01:18:51] like leveling multiple of the same
[01:18:52] weapon I like being able to alternate
[01:18:54] weapons sometimes I do four- star weapon
[01:18:55] clear I use freeto playay weapons battle
[01:18:56] pass weapon five star I likeing multiple
[01:18:59] of the same weapon now the the the I
[01:19:02] exception I think I could level a second
[01:19:04] red horn but the main problem here and
[01:19:06] this is a big problem like big
[01:19:11] problem it needs concealed Claws and I
[01:19:13] have seven and if you think I'm going to
[01:19:16] Great
[01:19:17] Britain wrong [ __ ] sound effect if
[01:19:19] you think I'm going to Great Britain
[01:19:21] [ __ ] tuno whatever the [ __ ] it's
[01:19:23] called you got me [ __ ] up I am not
[01:19:25] going to whatever the [ __ ] that place is
[01:19:27] called to kill Rift wolves however I am
[01:19:29] down to level this um and the main
[01:19:33] reason I could also level akamaru I
[01:19:35] think I might do that instead but the
[01:19:36] main reason why I have no Rift wolves is
[01:19:38] because I just level the kagr Varity and
[01:19:40] then I also got another one so yeah claw
[01:19:43] and handguard not very fun this one is
[01:19:44] claw and specters right isn't it isn't
[01:19:46] it please be claw inspects yeah yay so
[01:19:49] if I want to level another uh this is
[01:19:51] not very fun I would this is this is in
[01:19:54] a few different states this is
[01:19:56] considered
[01:19:58] torture so yeah I don't know what I'm
[01:20:01] going to do uh I might level another
[01:20:03] widsith everyone loves widsith I love
[01:20:05] widsith
[01:20:08] um I'm not sure but I just don't like
[01:20:12] having like a bunch of the same weapon
[01:20:13] leveled but since we need so many
[01:20:15] weapons anyways I don't mind leveling
[01:20:16] another uh same with Bose I'm leveling a
[01:20:19] second harp I might level a second fav
[01:20:23] uh I have a level one Fab okay it's on
[01:20:25] Linny why the [ __ ] is it on Linny oh cuz
[01:20:27] I geared Yia I don't want the Yia Mains
[01:20:30] in the video I hate me so I give yo look
[01:20:32] she not bad not
[01:20:37] bad but
[01:20:39] um yeah do you really need that many
[01:20:42] weapons no but I feel like the end game
[01:20:45] for me should be have everyone geared
[01:20:47] without having to change any gears
[01:20:49] because what more am I going for oh a 1%
[01:20:51] artifact increase on on Shia which takes
[01:20:53] me two [ __ ] years or emblem for all
[01:20:56] my

[01:30:13] robe what is the Friendship team okay
[01:30:15] let's say you're like damn I'm really

[01:30:23] you get a hot dog you go out on your own
[01:30:25] you get a hot dog maybe put some ketchup
[01:30:27] maybe some mustard maybe a relish if
[01:30:28] you're a psychopath and then you come
[01:30:30] home and you're like damn that was a
[01:30:31] good hot dog but you got no friendship
[01:30:33] that's like if I would go with Shia
[01:30:36] Bennett Kaza and Jong Lee or or farzon
[01:30:38] right that's like if you go with your
[01:30:41] family or your your you know someone who
[01:30:44] you're already maxed friendship with
[01:30:45] someone who you feel comfortable around
[01:30:47] that you wouldn't gain anything going
[01:30:49] for a hot do with them now however let's
[01:30:50] say there's someone you like or or you
[01:30:52] have friends I know a cool concept and
[01:30:54] you're like hey man what if we go get
[01:30:55] this hot dog together youo invite all
[01:30:57] the boys then you go five people right
[01:31:00] and you all go get hot dogs then you
[01:31:03] maybe talk about some stuff oh nice one
[01:31:06] then you all go back home your
[01:31:07] friendship level
[01:31:12] increased that's uh what we're doing
[01:31:13] right now net by fromen Are all uh not
[01:31:16] friendship 10 as you can see 4 8 2 and
[01:31:19] eight and we increase that it's like
[01:31:21] we're all going together uh on a
[01:31:29] date Justice is
[01:31:35] blindsighted settle
[01:31:41] down play oh also I did this in the
[01:31:44] video so you'll see it but
[01:31:46] literally literally while I was talking
[01:31:49] I uh crowned Hut normal attacks so
[01:31:53] that's done uh I also leveled someone
[01:31:56] else's talent but I can't remember who I
[01:31:58] think I leveled ao's burst to eight uh
[01:32:01] tanar burst to eight as well and I
[01:32:04] leveled uh maybe something else I'm not
[01:32:06] sure but yeah I was doing a bit of um
[01:32:09] long overdue
[01:32:15] things now that kakomi Synergy question
[01:32:17] mark the only Synergy you get is hydro
[01:32:19] resonance and maybe a weapon that could
[01:32:22] like buff someone else but he can't
[01:32:23] really use thrilling Tails um he doesn't
[01:32:26] care too much about well she can't use
[01:32:28] fav um so it's mainly just hydrin he
[01:32:30] also doesn't really care about
[01:32:33] healing because he heals himself so the
[01:32:36] only reason to run a Healer is if your
[01:32:38] other characters need it like look my HP
[01:32:41] is 13,000 and now it's 27 but now it's
[01:32:44] going to go back down but then I burst

[01:54:31] someone will gift it to you
[01:54:44] though it sounds like
[01:54:47] um what's the [ __ ] penguin that would
[01:54:49] go like
[01:54:50] D doot or n n or whatever the [ __ ] what

[01:54:54] penguin okay someone didn't even run an
[01:54:56] ad where is This was oh
[01:54:59] Pingu I miss
[01:55:05] Pingu okay well I guess we have to run
[01:55:07] an ad so see you Boos in 30 seconds I'm
[01:55:09] sorry I normally don't it's just someone
[01:55:11] redeemed it I'm
[01:55:13] sorry Fang I'm sure someone's going to
[01:55:16] give you a
[01:55:17] sub I'm sorry I don't run them I promise
[01:55:20] I
[01:55:21] don't reminder that streamers choose if
[01:55:24] they want to run them or not either it's
[01:55:25] not forced yet except at the start of
[01:55:27] the stream I think there's like a
[01:55:28] pre-roll when you enter the stream but
[01:55:30] outside
[01:55:32] that oh someone did gift her thank you
[01:55:37] kuer wait what am I doing all let's go
[01:55:39] can
[01:55:41] resin no map
[01:55:48] stop
[01:55:52] it's in some contracts yeah but that's
[01:55:54] the funny part did you know that Contra
[01:55:56] uh contracts require two consenting
[01:55:58] parties or more which means that you
[01:56:00] have to agree to
[01:56:02] it that's pretty cool
[01:56:05] wow in fact twitch will be like hey if
[01:56:08] you run this many ads you get this much
[01:56:10] money so I I honestly think it's dumb if
[01:56:13] you're just like no [ __ ] all that money
[01:56:15] which is what I do because I'm like I
[01:56:16] don't want to run ads so I don't I know
[01:56:19] I know a hero I know I'm like a modern
[01:56:21] day Robin Hood I know I
[01:56:25] know but
[01:56:27] yeah hey who knows maybe it'll be Force
[01:56:33] eventually sh plusy plusy right now I P
[01:56:36] chap I can get
[01:56:39] him but I also but see the the way I
[01:56:42] view it is like I won't run ads like
[01:56:43] there's a pre-roll ad when you enter but
[01:56:44] other than that I don't run ads unless
[01:56:46] there's a Chann Point redeem but that
[01:56:47] usually doesn't happen because I'm like
[01:56:49] well I [ __ ] hate as as a viewer but
[01:56:51] what this lets me do is now I feel like
[01:56:54] that okay because I don't do that I can
[01:56:55] do like sponsor streams sometimes
[01:56:56] sometimes it's literally G Sor all it'll
[01:56:58] be like we did McDonald's we did like
[01:57:00] some other games that we like to try and
[01:57:01] then it's like it forces me to variety
[01:57:03] and it's like the same thing but I don't
[01:57:05] have to run eyes every day okay one
[01:57:07] second I'm getting sh here you go here

[02:03:28] Silence
[02:03:44] no wow Chad I started watching um
[02:03:49] I started watching what are they
[02:03:52] called well I just dropped my Clin
[02:03:57] box I started watching GI uh uh Studio
[02:04:00] gibli jibli whatever the [ __ ] it's
[02:04:02] called movies they're pretty good well
[02:04:03] they're like pretty I don't know I
[02:04:04] didn't watch all of them but I watch
[02:04:05] like four they're pretty wholesome but I
[02:04:07] know some of them are like aware but the
[02:04:09] ones that I watch are pretty
[02:04:17] wholesome but I'm also not the type of
[02:04:20] person to watch something to be sad I
[02:04:22] get like there's obviously a point for
[02:04:23] that but like for those I'm kind of like
[02:04:26] not inclined to watch like if I have
[02:04:28] free choice obviously if like you
[02:04:32] know like I'm sure they're good but yeah
[02:04:36] you're on mute okay which ones did you
[02:04:38] watch I watched oh okay a while ago I
[02:04:41] watched hows recently I watched the
[02:04:45] [ __ ] the one with the dragon who's
[02:04:46] like raar I'm Shia Lament Don Hong and B
[02:04:49] Lune that one Spirited Away with like
[02:04:52] the the Ducks and then I watched this
[02:04:54] looks pretty good this could be good and
[02:04:55] then I watched uh tooro and I might have
[02:04:59] watch another one but I can't remember
[02:05:01] I'm going to watch Pono next I
[02:05:06] think watch P fire yeah it's literally
[02:05:16] kakomi do you need don't you think hard
[02:05:18] to death is better than Hunter set if
[02:05:19] you have better crit rate on every no no
[02:05:24] no no
[02:05:29] no it's okay if your artifact stats are
[02:05:32] dog [ __ ] like maybe okay maybe maybe if
[02:05:35] your Mar chos is complete garbage maybe
[02:05:37] maybe it's about 16% better Mar chose
[02:05:42] is depending on how many crate uh charge
[02:05:45] attacks you a rotation maybe if you're
[02:05:48] hard dep is amazing and your magy is bad
[02:05:50] you can go hard depth you can go Nim
[02:05:52] stream you can go wandering troop
[02:05:55] Wanderers troop you can go uh buy you
[02:05:57] can go twopiece twopiece they're all
[02:05:59] about as good if people that say oh
[02:06:00] they're not about as good you're dumb
[02:06:02] they're all about as good hard that is
[02:06:03] slightly better twopiece two piece is
[02:06:05] about as good but more flexible and then
[02:06:07] if you don't have those if you can Farm
[02:06:09] Mar it is way better uh like 16 15 to
[02:06:13] 20% better than all of the other options
[02:06:15] so
[02:06:17] yeah
[02:06:19] let a little is 4 HP too much no the
[02:06:22] more HP the better it's just you also
[02:06:24] want like crit and [ __ ] so you're not
[02:06:25] only looking for
[02:06:27] HP I I that needs a bit more HP right
[02:06:30] now that's what I'm looking
[02:06:41] for by Royal
[02:06:47] Decree
[02:06:55] oh oh oh wait wait let me cook ER is
[02:07:00] good crit damage is good let me cook let
[02:07:03] me cook let me cook this could also be a
[02:07:05] crit Ki piece true no she needs crit
[02:07:07] rate but still could be good okay we
[02:07:09] level that could this be good uh
[02:07:14] no how much HP range is good doesn't
[02:07:17] matter
[02:07:19] go HP S level him to 90 try to get some
[02:07:22] HP sub stats that's all you need like
[02:07:24] more is good but you're never looking
[02:07:25] for specific number cuz it doesn't like
[02:07:27] I would want a bit more cuz I have so
[02:07:28] much crit damage but
[02:07:30] like you it depends on what your weapon
[02:07:33] is and like your artifacts and this and
[02:07:34] that and this and
[02:07:39] that okay let's level the new
[02:07:43] goblet Pepe W
[02:07:47] whale
[02:07:50] if it gets crit I'm molding why why do
[02:07:54] you forget what happened to me in
[02:07:59] Vermilion do I not deserve anything for
[02:08:02] my
[02:08:06] suffering dude I dude I dude I literally
[02:08:10] with a capital l [ __ ] I leveled
[02:08:14] this I leveled a guilded dreams em sand
[02:08:18] this one it didn't have crit rate I
[02:08:19] swear off stream this was plus zero out
[02:08:21] of three stats it got 3.9 crit rate it

[02:45:14] p
[02:45:19] wait Chad what's your take okay now that
[02:45:21] fane's been out for like a month no more
[02:45:23] than a month since my birthday when was
[02:45:24] my birthday two months
[02:45:27] ago what you guys think wait what's your
[02:45:29] take on swimming think it's good or do
[02:45:31] you think it's good or bad how do you
[02:45:33] enjoy the
[02:45:34] swimming aware two
[02:45:37] [Music]
[02:45:38] months dude I like
[02:45:41] it I think I was a okay okay okay okay
[02:45:44] this is my take I was afraid that okay I
[02:45:48] would rather I don't say this lightly I
[02:45:51] would ra I would rather eat an entire
[02:45:54] tray of of of of of Blended rocks into a
[02:45:59] sand formation smoothie than do
[02:46:02] underwater levels in virtually any other
[02:46:04] game with a few
[02:46:06] exceptions and I actually enjoy the
[02:46:08] swimm mechanic in this game I think it's
[02:46:09] fine it doesn't feel like I I want to
[02:46:11] die uh the music's nice it's pretty cool
[02:46:14] I wish that was more yes I think the
[02:46:16] fighting does get repetitive I think
[02:46:17] it's annoying that I can't use abilities
[02:46:19] but at least I can pick the hydro
[02:46:21] animals I do think the domains
[02:46:24] underwater should give you like one of
[02:46:26] every animal like a curvy boss
[02:46:29] light you choose one of there's all the
[02:46:31] hydro animals you can choose which one
[02:46:32] you want and then that's your power up
[02:46:33] going into it and you have to fight it
[02:46:35] like that I think they could have made
[02:46:36] it a bit better but exploring wise I
[02:46:38] like it I think it's pretty cool it's
[02:46:40] way better than the [ __ ] desert of
[02:46:41] nothingness I'm sorry I said
[02:46:43] it I'm sorry I said it and that's my
[02:46:47] region but I love sumu I think suu okay
[02:46:51] I'm going to pause this [ __ ] you Pikmin
[02:46:53] I'm sorry that was me I think I think
[02:46:55] sumu exploration outside of the desert
[02:46:58] is my favorite cuz there's a
[02:47:00] little there's like araras there's like
[02:47:02] a lot of cool things I really liked it
[02:47:05] it's just like the late like the more
[02:47:06] desert I kind of couldn't be asked
[02:47:08] anymore uh but the underwater is
[02:47:13] fun so
[02:47:20] yeah it wasn't like
[02:47:27] challenging
[02:47:32] but I also haven't finished it I mean
[02:47:34] I've only swam like I haven't even
[02:47:36] [ __ ] finished it yet
[02:47:43] so
[02:47:50] I like the desert inauma as well take
[02:47:52] that okay I think inauma
[02:47:55] okay you know what the dude Inazuma is
[02:47:57] probably the most liked region it's
[02:47:59] actually it's not even close like
[02:48:01] objectively not close I and and that's
[02:48:04] like despite all of its flaws just cuz
[02:48:06] people are like oh like it's either
[02:48:08] people feel like oh purple pretty or
[02:48:11] just weaves because it's Japan or the
[02:48:14] [ __ ] Aron looks like that and pulls a
[02:48:16] sword out of her boobs so that's that
[02:48:19] also the characters are the characters
[02:48:20] are cool I like Inazuma characters a lot
[02:48:23] and [ __ ] uh it's the first new region
[02:48:26] that came out like it was 2.0 so there's
[02:48:28] a lot of
[02:48:30] like this commu
[02:48:33] like certain communities aside is
[02:48:36] probably the most well-liked region I
[02:48:37] just think the archon quests were kind
[02:48:40] of ass but I also don't remember half of
[02:48:43] them cuz my memory is dog [ __ ] but I
[02:48:44] just remember being like pretty
[02:48:46] disappointed in some story lines and um
[02:48:49] that the exploration and stuff is just
[02:48:51] not in my opinion not as good as like
[02:48:54] sumaru minus the desert and even Fontan
[02:48:56] so
[02:49:01] far come on be honest the only reason
[02:49:04] I'm not like giving a super harsh
[02:49:05] opinion is cuz I don't remember half the
[02:49:07] [ __ ] but from the [ __ ] that I do
[02:49:09] remember yeah it was pretty just uh the
[02:49:11] quests definitely
[02:49:13] were yeah it was it was hype Peak I will
[02:49:16] agree the peak hypeness of what am I
[02:49:18] doing what am I
[02:49:28] doing that just means inuma forgettable
[02:49:31] no no like I genuinely can't remember a
[02:49:34] lot of things in life I don't know why I
[02:49:36] don't remember things I just have bad
[02:49:39] memory I genuinely will be like fully
[02:49:41] focusing and caring and then I'll forget
[02:49:43] it so I have to write things down and
[02:49:46] then I remember
[02:49:48] them maybe five out of six I don't
[02:50:12] know so I feel like nothing has topped R
[02:50:15] in trailer hype to this
[02:50:17] day young man or woman young person I
[02:50:21] would like to disagree
[02:50:23] because I to me nothing has hyped this
[02:50:28] now I know I know I know I know the rden
[02:50:31] trailer was
[02:50:33] hype however may I present to you a
[02:50:37] counterargument may I present to you a
[02:50:39] counterargument where I chilled so many
[02:50:41] chills and grew so many inches that I
[02:50:43] did not want to speak
[02:50:47] this is probably the game trailer I have
[02:50:50] watched I have been the most hype from
[02:50:52] from any
[02:50:53] game the sages think themselves to be
[02:50:56] all knowing but we alone are wise to The
[02:51:01] Virtue in those acts of
[02:51:04] folly in this war not even a single Pawn
[02:51:09] may be
[02:51:10] spared because on this chest board dude
[02:51:13] cuz we didn't know who any of these
[02:51:14] character were either like they just
[02:51:15] were like boom look at all these new
[02:51:19] characters I don't even think they were
[02:51:21] leaked maybe some were leaked I actually
[02:51:22] don't remember any of them being leak
[02:51:23] like I feel like obviously it's like
[02:51:25] Senora Scara child but like most of them
[02:51:26] were just like what the [ __ ] is this
[02:51:28] then you wake up to like
[02:51:30] [Music]
[02:51:33] 26 we knew we just didn't know designs
[02:51:35] yeah but no one cares about their names
[02:51:37] we are gathered here actually in lore we
[02:51:40] saw that his name was the [ __ ] doctor
[02:51:42] yeah but it doesn't matter
[02:51:46] remember our dear comrade in honor of
[02:51:49] her sacrifice dude oh my God look at

[02:52:59] day people say the Northland bank's true
[02:53:02] currencies are blood and tears and then
[02:53:04] they revealed OK code in gen impact
[02:53:07] sounds a little unconscious my
[02:53:09] streamer Rosaline died in a foreign land
[02:53:13] then they showed my wife in I thought
[02:53:15] this was a personal thing convenient
[02:53:17] excuse to remain in the comfort of your
[02:53:20] Homeland you couldn't hope to understand
[02:53:23] so why don't you keep your mouths shut
[02:53:25] we don't want to make the Children Cry

[02:53:34] everything that I own or place for a
[02:53:37] [Music]

[02:54:15] names I'm
[02:54:16] sorry conventional wisdom hold this is

[02:54:22] thought dor was holding come here I
[02:54:24] would like to retract that statement I
[02:54:25] now think he's holding the font water
[02:54:27] that dissolves any font in person that
[02:54:30] Divine knowledge cannot be rationally
[02:54:34] comprehended after Conquering the div

[02:55:06] I want to be able to play him now with
[02:55:08] that in mind with that in mind with that
[02:55:10] in mind they're probably going to do
[02:55:12] some dumb [ __ ] like oh I am the good
[02:55:14] Doric clone and I killed the bad one and
[02:55:16] then we play him and while I don't want
[02:55:18] that to be true I would rather that than
[02:55:21] not being able to play him however I
[02:55:23] would like it if he's evil and you can
[02:55:25] still play him and then you can only in
[02:55:28] your teapot you can only put him in the

[03:12:31] damage could you imagine if you go to
[03:12:33] Natan and [ __ ] it turns out in a
[03:12:35] Twist of a Twist of events that Shang
[03:12:37] Lings the Pyro archon and we were right
[03:12:39] all
[03:12:41] along
[03:12:47] [Music]
[03:12:52] wait one
[03:12:54] sec wait where the [ __ ] did the Majestic
[03:12:56] videos go I saw a a thumbnail in like
[03:13:00] patch 1.0 it was like a click it was
[03:13:02] like it was like a it was just like
[03:13:04] clickbait where he was like the
[03:13:05] thumbnail was like Shang Ling's the best
[03:13:07] character but like it turns out he was
[03:13:11] right
[03:13:13] obviously at the time was like Crescent
[03:13:15] Pike
[03:13:16] but trying to find the thumbnail I can't
[03:13:18] find
[03:13:35] it
[03:13:41] anyways
[03:13:48] dude I believe okay I don't know who
[03:13:49] said this like I'm not going to [ __ ]
[03:13:50] blame a person for this cuz it was a
[03:13:52] pretty widespread rumor but I actually I
[03:13:55] unironically wholeheartedly not only
[03:13:58] belied that chest respawned but
[03:13:59] literally would go on chest routes to
[03:14:01] try to see if they did and I thought I
[03:14:03] used to think that like the lava like
[03:14:05] the the orange [ __ ] I still do I don't
[03:14:07] even know what's true anymore but the
[03:14:08] orange [ __ ] around [ __ ] one of the
[03:14:10] mountains had like a bunch of like a at
[03:14:12] getting a common chest every time you
[03:14:14] broke them the [ __ ] yeah the ambers I
[03:14:16] so I would always do them was it here
[03:14:18] yeah I L this is not even me dude I
[03:14:21] didn't make this on stream this was me
[03:14:23] and 1.0 I genuinely believe that they
[03:14:26] spawned I am not joking I didn't even
[03:14:28] know that was there look look look I
[03:14:31] would literally every day I would
[03:14:32] teleport here and I was like yo I can't
[03:14:34] wait to get common
[03:14:36] chests they did respawn but only a
[03:14:38] finite amount of time well see there you
[03:14:39] go so I would literally do these and
[03:14:42] maybe at first they did spawn maybe
[03:14:43] that's why I knew wait where is it where
[03:14:46] is it let me go break some let me go
[03:14:47] break some maybe we'll get one right now
[03:14:48] maybe we'll get one right now what if we
[03:14:49] get one yeah I think there would be
[03:14:51] chests like one time you could get them
[03:14:53] in or something but it wouldn't like
[03:14:56] respawn let's
[03:14:57] see [ __ ] wait wait wait wait do I need
[03:15:00] to use an element or is it just a oh
[03:15:01] it's just punch just
[03:15:03] punch it's been a while it's been a
[03:15:06] while Crystal fly okay not
[03:15:11] bad there were some chests that only
[03:15:13] respawn when you increase your World
[03:15:14] level yeah that's probably
[03:15:19] why like I guess it makes sense why
[03:15:21] people didn't get it at the start but
[03:15:23] yeah I just I don't know I just believed
[03:15:25] whatever I saw in a YouTube video so I
[03:15:27] was
[03:15:28] like Bennett bad cuz he can fall off a
[03:15:31] cliff with his hold
[03:15:33] e that was only for like a month though
[03:15:35] eventually you know we got
[03:15:38] better I was using Bennett like October
[03:15:41] 2020 so only only a few
[03:15:42] days two
[03:15:52] weeks I thought they respawn until I
[03:15:53] watched I'm a CutiePie Farm chest for
[03:15:55] two dude one of my first genin impact
[03:15:57] like Memories I watched before I even I
[03:16:00] played like day one but I had like or
[03:16:02] day two but like either day two or three
[03:16:04] I watched I'm a CutiePie playing and he
[03:16:07] had a team of full five stars I was like
[03:16:09] wow I hope one day I can have a team of
[03:16:11] five stars and it was like duuke Mona
[03:16:13] chii and like Jean or something or maybe
[03:16:16] not Jean it was like duuke Mona Chichi
[03:16:18] and
[03:16:19] like I don't know kaching I think and I
[03:16:21] was like wow like I can't wait to have
[03:16:23] that team and now I play
[03:16:28] Shang okay let me uh
[03:16:35] yeah one of your memories was watching
[03:16:37] your video to see if it was worth
[03:16:39] pulling Shia okay but dude I was dude
[03:16:42] dude I'm proud of my first sh video dude
[03:16:44] Shia was Shia was busted I I think at
[03:16:48] the time Shia was broken and Shia was
[03:16:49] still really good I I have no regrets
[03:16:52] hyping Shia I think he's he's a good
[03:16:54] hyper
[03:16:55] carry especially because if you anytime
[03:16:57] you pull for Shia you're probably you
[03:16:59] probably like him so you probably invest
[03:17:01] into him and then if you invest into him
[03:17:02] he's just a good hyper
[03:17:07] carry shot fell off no he got better he
[03:17:10] was good when he first came out and then
[03:17:12] got better because there was only a
[03:17:14] small period of time where uh like AOE
[03:17:16] was always better but then there's a
[03:17:18] small period of time where Abyss became
[03:17:20] bosses so single Target became better
[03:17:21] but then right after that Vermilion and
[03:17:23] then right after that Hut and new
[03:17:25] weapons also
[03:17:30] um wait what was
[03:17:35] it what was I think of I
[03:17:39] forget oh yeah I remember at the time
[03:17:41] people thought sh need needed like a
[03:17:42] million ER I
[03:17:45] didn't wait let's watch my first child
[03:17:48] guide [ __ ] did I say was it
[03:17:53] bad well I actually can't even find it
[03:17:59] anymore NPC hey what's up
[03:18:09] guys okay let shall Barb thrilling Tails
[03:18:12] I that makes
[03:18:16] sense whoa 40K plunge whoa I didn't crit
[03:18:20] that one whoa I mean that's not even
[03:18:25] bad dud it's not even bad wait I
[03:18:27] literally okay granted the timing on the
[03:18:29] normal cancel wasn't ideal like you can
[03:18:31] do it without losing any frames but I
[03:18:33] actually did try to weave in a normal
[03:18:35] between my punes dude I was cracked for
[03:18:38] [ __ ] February 2021 I was cracked
[03:18:46] like what the hey what's up guys Shia is
[03:18:49] okay all right listen listen listen we
[03:18:51] don't talk about this was a different
[03:18:53] time oh my God the best two-piece five
[03:18:56] star for Shia is Gladiator so twopiece
[03:18:59] Gladiator and twopiece FID descent okay
[03:19:01] now since Gladiator is so hard to farm
[03:19:03] right it's only comes from bosses and
[03:19:05] you're not guaranteed a five star till
[03:19:06] ar55 oh my god there was no strong box
[03:19:08] uh you can run another two-piece or you
[03:19:10] can just run what's another two-piece
[03:19:12] what the [ __ ] with like whatever has
[03:19:13] good sub stats because 18% attack isn't
[03:19:15] that huge but ideally two vescent with
[03:19:17] two glad is what you should be aiming
[03:19:18] for also I just want to say in case
[03:19:20] you're wondering four piece rcent vener
[03:19:22] it just isn't worth it on Shia as a main
[03:19:23] DPS because well I updated that I
[03:19:25] remember I pinned a
[03:19:27] comment oh no that was the next guide
[03:19:29] next guide I said you could it increases
[03:19:31] your swirl dther in a comp where you can
[03:19:33] constantly apply Electro like it's not
[03:19:36] even even
[03:19:37] wrong okay now let's talk about right
[03:19:40] because your main character can be a
[03:19:41] Nemo
[03:19:42] some are better than others like sucros
[03:19:44] and venti generate much more than
[03:19:47] someone like wait why is my main
[03:19:48] character level
[03:19:49] 33 even just MC with other batteries can
[03:19:52] be enough but we're going to talk about
[03:19:53] this in the party setup section okay
[03:19:55] cool that being said the energy recharge
[03:19:57] you need varies personally I've noticed
[03:19:59] wa this build yo chat this build I
[03:20:01] remember it it's like lowkey better than
[03:20:02] my current one was more than enough my
[03:20:05] shild on release this was a happy okay
[03:20:07] my flower wasn't as good I was running
[03:20:08] was I was running this I I didn't know
[03:20:10] was that old and my overall uh dude this
[03:20:13] is like dude 82 199 and I was getting my
[03:20:17] 140 I have 140 now but for some people
[03:20:20] you might want more ER substats once
[03:20:22] again depending on your comp I would say
[03:20:24] a good range with Good batteries in your
[03:20:26] team uhoh is usually around 140 150 but
[03:20:30] you might need more bad but for the
[03:20:31] substats you want on your artifact crit
[03:20:33] energy recharge and attack percent now
[03:20:36] in terms of specific pieces we'll talk
[03:20:37] about the Sands mainly you just Sands
[03:20:39] and you can look for energy recharge on
[03:20:41] substats in for the cir a lot spaming
[03:20:45] the
[03:20:47] jar wait look at my weapons chat look at
[03:20:50] my weapons my Shang Ling is on Crescent
[03:20:53] Pike yo look at yo yo yo I have Jade
[03:20:59] Deathmatch
[03:21:01] Pike
[03:21:04] sheesh a guide for everyone first of all
[03:21:06] the Jade spear is amazing it is the best
[03:21:08] spear overall for him because of the
[03:21:10] very high base attack of 48 the crit
[03:21:13] rate substat which is just great on sh
[03:21:15] what I say I think always thought I was
[03:21:17] like C6 because of how I feel like I
[03:21:19] feel like people hated SE at the start
[03:21:21] cuz the logic was like he's a DPS
[03:21:23] character so you're not going to need a
[03:21:24] Char you're not going to in a long fight
[03:21:26] you're not going to gain three charges
[03:21:27] cuz you're going to use them all the
[03:21:28] time but I feel like the more investment
[03:21:30] you go and the the more doesn't really
[03:21:32] need constellations them very quickly so
[03:21:35] very quickly C6 is really really okay
[03:21:37] shut up Z comp alteration wait this is
[03:21:40] actually a good comp though
[03:21:45] seconds kind of like Razer or like child
[03:21:47] in his e but he also needs a good team
[03:21:48] comp to be played a just want support
[03:21:51] wait let me look at my character levels
[03:21:53] wait this kind of
[03:21:54] based Bennett we got ning Wong level 80
[03:21:58] dude ning Wong was my I had one two
[03:22:00] three four only five characters level 80
[03:22:02] ning Wong is one of them so without
[03:22:04] going too in detail basically you just
[03:22:05] want another Animo support to make sure
[03:22:08] your child I played I played ning Wong J
[03:22:11] Le albo Bennett bur supports like like
[03:22:13] burst quick Swap all of them Bennett
[03:22:15] full I mean Jang Lee full crit albo full
[03:22:17] crit [ __ ] ning Wong full crit Benet I
[03:22:20] don't it was dumb well it wasn't even
[03:22:22] bad but like energy Bas it was fun hey I
[03:22:25] missed it now a character like venty or
[03:22:26] a character like sucrose especially with
[03:22:28] C1 can generate a ton of why bet so low
[03:22:31] um bet was a later a later discovery of
[03:22:34] mine actually Betto is um I didn't play
[03:22:37] bet much I think b z Jeff was like B's
[03:22:39] broken and then I was like I guess I'll
[03:22:41] play bet and I played
[03:22:42] B be a very efficient battery for uh
[03:22:46] Shia Jean is also Amal enjoyer because
[03:22:49] she feels I would talk about FAL being
[03:22:50] good and then Z was like okay but
[03:22:53] b as of healer and Battery as a two in
[03:22:56] one but now like I'm recharge uh let's
[03:23:00] create a new team to make this simpler
[03:23:02] basically particles which is great they
[03:23:05] don't generate enough to be sufficient
[03:23:07] so you would want to run them with
[03:23:08] another uh battery character so like if
[03:23:11] you're running Gan or MC right one of
[03:23:13] the two then you would want something
[03:23:15] like ficial a fun sh or you could run
[03:23:17] more energy recharge uh let's create a
[03:23:18] new team to make this bro was using a
[03:23:19] toaster as it was a Blue Yeti
[03:23:22] simpler you'd want another anemo
[03:23:24] character for the sake of the example
[03:23:25] you the whale to make videos any sort of
[03:23:27] ano battery two very this is actually a
[03:23:30] good team though this is actually a good
[03:23:31] guide W
[03:23:34] guide wait what was wait what is the
[03:23:37] Showcase oh my God this Abyss

[03:40:21] Spire that's pretty much
[03:40:27] it the slay fire is so fun but I'm so
[03:40:30] bad I have like a 100 hours in it and
[03:40:32] I'm still dog [ __ ] that game dude I
[03:40:35] actually I have literally like a 100
[03:40:37] hours and I'm still bad
[03:40:42] were you watching life coach dude I love
[03:40:43] life coach I used to watch him when he
[03:40:44] played
[03:40:46] Hearthstone he would [ __ ] rope every
[03:40:49] turn oh wait this got a crit rate wait
[03:40:54] this is
[03:40:58] perfect 50 oh he got it damn good for
[03:41:00] him I saw him when he was 48 I didn't
[03:41:02] know he got 50
[03:41:03] sheesh that's [ __ ] crazy I can't even
[03:41:05] get two in a
[03:41:07] row wait this is literally perfect the
[03:41:09] ER roll is sad uh official doesn't want
[03:41:11] ER but hey attack crit rate crit damage
[03:41:14] let me cook if you don't let me cook I
[03:41:16] will cook you Shang Ling what that's a
[03:41:19] low roll but it's good that's a low roll
[03:41:20] but it's
[03:41:21] good it's okay in life to have low rolls
[03:41:25] it's okay sometimes a life you have is
[03:41:27] what it is is what it
[03:41:38] is every I got to stop hitting my desk
[03:41:41] it's becoming curved okay I literally
[03:41:43] can't aim straight cuz there's now a
[03:41:44] curve because every time this happens
[03:41:47] calm down could be good could be good
[03:41:49] far on yeah far on piece
[03:42:04] true best Zio golden troop arm all at
[03:42:08] least I have a good Mar say [ __ ] it
[03:42:23] if I get another ER roll I will eat my
[03:42:27] microphone on stream if I get crit r or
[03:42:28] crit damage I'll be happy if I get
[03:42:31] attack attack's honestly worse than ER
[03:42:33] here we don't want attack but now that I
[03:42:35] said
[03:42:36] that oh pretty good I mean yeah no it's
[03:42:41] good it's actually good it's actually
[03:42:42] good this is actually good this is good
[03:42:43] this good all substats are useful at
[03:42:45] three rolls of level zero but what okay
[03:42:47] so for example if we look at my Yi Miko
[03:42:49] right now right we look at my yai Miko
[03:42:51] what is she on she has really good
[03:42:53] artifacts really good uh sub stats a lot
[03:42:55] of em and enough ER but in order to have
[03:42:57] enough ER we run an electro go that has
[03:42:59] 23 ER but if I swap the golden troop uh
[03:43:02] now we can get enough ER just from our
[03:43:05] flower that's pretty good minimum roll
[03:43:07] crit damage yeah but who cares not bad
[03:43:15] finina how would you know how would you
[03:43:17] know what finina needs we don't know
[03:43:19] much about her how would you know huh
[03:43:23] please
[03:43:26] explain that's what I thought now
[03:43:28] obviously Hydro archon it's it's okay
[03:43:30] listen I don't look at leaks and I'm
[03:43:32] just guessing new set probably scales on
[03:43:34] HP probably wants crit like that's all
[03:43:36] you can dude it's not [ __ ] hard to
[03:43:38] guess but maybe not could be wrong
[03:43:40] Hydro [ __ ] archon that's just the
[03:43:42] guess but I could be wrong maybe she
[03:43:44] wants [ __ ] caul what that sounds
[03:43:47] weird I didn't mean it that
[03:43:49] way but who knows we don't know the
[03:43:52] weapon we don't know the ER we don't
[03:43:53] know what he's going to do you know I
[03:43:54] don't
[03:43:56] know the thing is my like prediction so
[03:43:59] the thing is I now assume that I'm right
[03:44:02] because I predicted 18 patches ago that
[03:44:04] she's going to [ __ ] with your HP and
[03:44:06] every time I say that feel type Suk so I
[03:44:08] just assume I guessed correctly
[03:44:10] but we'll
[03:44:19] see I haven't played her dude uh okay
[03:44:23] where's
[03:44:24] the oh yeah D Chad do any of these give

[04:01:13] these gu okay I know I know copium right
[04:01:15] I know copium okay I missed that we
[04:01:17] don't talk about that we don't talk
[04:01:18] about that I repeat cuz I'm dumb but
[04:01:19] these guys
[04:01:21] sucked whatever it doesn't matter wait
[04:01:23] surely there was something that didn't
[04:01:24] suck pretty sure I hit something at some
[04:01:26] point oh here wait this wasn't bad na
[04:01:30] aim wait it literally wasn't even
[04:01:31] bad it literally wasn't even bad wait

[04:01:36] shot this we don't talk about that one
[04:01:37] look at this I had one bullet that
[04:01:39] wasn't bad look okay this was kind of
[04:01:42] whiff but I one bullet oh holy [ __ ] holy
[04:01:47] [ __ ] body shot Andy wait okay but that
[04:01:50] was on his head though I was just moving
[04:01:51] I think or was I moving did I [ __ ] the
[04:01:53] counter stra
[04:01:55] up yeah I I was I still I [ __ ] my
[04:01:57] counter St up cuz I didn't expect him
[04:01:58] there but it's fine doesn't matter and
[04:02:00] then after that I was
[04:02:02] good whatever doesn't matter that was
[04:02:06] today sorry I'm
[04:02:12] sorry okay before we leave chat as
[04:02:16] always you don't need to coun Val shut
[04:02:18] up shut the [ __ ] up I'm not calling it
[04:02:19] dead zoning I'm not an idiot it's
[04:02:21] actually dead zoning you stopped the
[04:02:23] movement key yet shut up I hate people
[04:02:25] that do that I'm sorry that's not true a
[04:02:27] lot of people say that
[04:02:28] but it's the same thing
[04:02:32] um also I feel like it hurts new players
[04:02:35] if you say that because people then
[04:02:37] think that they can just stop moving
[04:02:38] instead of learning how to use the
[04:02:40] inverse movement key so then they stop
[04:02:42] moving and then it's like they stand
[04:02:43] still to shoot and then that's just way
[04:02:44] worse than if you move around while you
[04:02:46] shoot which is what I thought when I
[04:02:48] started which made me learn slower cuz I
[04:02:50] came from
[04:02:54] OverWatch hey chat and Z chat you look
