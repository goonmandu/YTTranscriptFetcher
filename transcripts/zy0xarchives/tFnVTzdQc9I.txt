[00:34:42] what the [ __ ] is oatmeal
[00:34:45] um
[00:34:46] thank you for
[00:34:48] completing today's commissions
[00:34:55] doing anything new no
[00:34:58] no of course
[00:35:01] don't wanna Market I don't think so I
[00:35:03] have to finally returned from another
[00:35:05] realm dude we've gotten one two three
[00:35:10] new regions with no ores sovereign
[00:35:34] Stars so we're not getting a Bennett or
[00:35:36] a shingling or official or a singjo or a
[00:35:38] sucrose ever again
[00:35:40] aware
[00:35:51] true but yeah yeah I was okay yeah that
[00:35:54] was the goat I [ __ ] love Yayo but
[00:35:56] Yaya is also just
[00:36:00] what do you mean yeah yeah it's good
[00:36:02] because dendro's good
[00:36:04] but the what do you mean we got Dory
[00:36:05] that's never mind that's a good counter
[00:36:07] argument actually
[00:36:08] I forgot I forgot about I forgot about
[00:36:10] Dory I'm sorry
[00:36:26] actually okay no bias right now okay
[00:36:29] because I know people can be like oh my
[00:36:30] God Layla and Layla's fine but okay no
[00:36:33] bias or not did we actually since like
[00:36:35] since the first batch of four stars like
[00:36:37] one point like one point whatever right
[00:36:38] did we ever get a good four star
[00:36:43] that isn't good only because of dendro
[00:36:46] teams so for example like any danger
[00:36:49] random danger character who's just good
[00:36:50] because of dendro or like kooky because
[00:36:52] of hyperbloom
[00:36:55] Rosaria yeah but Rosario's monster but I
[00:36:58] guess she's a bit later than 1.0 so sure
[00:37:01] farzan without C6 is literally like
[00:37:03] you're playing a [ __ ] you're playing
[00:37:05] but like
[00:37:07] yeah I don't even want to talk about it
[00:37:09] it's like a wheelbarrow but without
[00:37:10] wheels or barrels
[00:37:14] oh actually
[00:37:16] the move for Xiao at c0 it's you just
[00:37:18] need to
[00:37:21] ma yeah but toma's only good with
[00:37:23] [ __ ] deadro mostly
[00:37:27] Hazel you sure but Hazel's just sucrose
[00:37:31] but not sucrose
[00:37:34] wait actually okay I was kind of memeing
[00:37:37] when I said this but like wait a second
[00:37:38] wait a second is there a way to filter
[00:37:40] by like a release date
[00:37:43] wait a second
[00:37:44] wait a second
[00:37:46] let's filter by quality
[00:37:48] wait a second
[00:37:49] wait a second
[00:37:53] like Layla's cool
[00:37:56] a these are early characters Yen face
[00:37:58] fine Candice Dory
[00:38:01] Sarah Mika Goro
[00:38:05] I guess okay to be like Fair they kind
[00:38:07] of release like
[00:38:09] character archives in order oh that's a
[00:38:11] good take actually they released like
[00:38:13] really Niche supports that are good but
[00:38:15] good in their Niche dude because it
[00:38:17] they're like okay we gotta stop we gave
[00:38:18] them Bennett we gave them sintro we gave
[00:38:20] them [ __ ] official we gotta stop no
[00:38:22] more we made a mistake so now we're
[00:38:24] gonna do like characters that are also
[00:38:26] pretty good but you need constellations
[00:38:28] and they're also good in with one
[00:38:30] element in one team only and then they
[00:38:32] gave us [ __ ] Sara Goro farazan
[00:38:36] really who else saw you I mean Kevin's
[00:38:39] decent but he's like I mean it's Cafe
[00:38:41] he's like I'll hide them but without the
[00:38:42] mirrors and then Yaya was good but
[00:38:44] dendro and then fermented from an A
[00:38:47] Rosario is good
[00:38:48] Hazel's okay as far as on the [ __ ]
[00:38:51] Niche thing we talked about same with
[00:38:52] Yoon Jin
[00:38:53] same toma's only good in [ __ ] virgin
[00:38:55] Kira is cool but just dendro
[00:39:00] kooky again mainly just good for dendro
[00:39:05] um
[00:39:05] I mean I guess there isn't yeah I don't
[00:39:07] know
[00:39:09] don't disrespect Cafe I mean he's
[00:39:11] literally just Al heighten but without
[00:39:12] the mirrors
[00:39:20] why is Mika bad Mika is literally just
[00:39:23] Mika okay Mika's burst okay Mika is
[00:39:27] literally just like
[00:39:31] we're just getting goros for every
[00:39:33] [ __ ] element and Mika is just that
[00:39:35] but for physical and even then he's like
[00:39:36] there's something there's just like also
[00:39:38] better options a lot of the time like
[00:39:40] he's like okay but like
[00:39:42] yeah
[00:39:44] it's been I think it's C6 it's like
[00:39:46] we'll help him be like more relevant
[00:39:49] like Loki just forgot what isn't it like
[00:39:51] physical crit damage or some [ __ ] where
[00:39:52] the [ __ ] is Mika
[00:39:54] where the [ __ ] is Mika
[00:39:58] yeah physical card damage so like yeah
[00:40:01] but also with
[00:40:04] recently as you swap so with Eula you
[00:40:06] can't swap early
[00:40:07] anyways
[00:40:11] he's not okay
[00:40:14] yeah
[00:40:15] also his burst doesn't even doesn't his
[00:40:17] burst not do damage and not apply cryo
[00:40:19] and it's literally just
[00:40:20] and we'll heal you I'm Mika
[00:40:29] correct
[00:40:31] yeah Diana down is pretty good but
[00:40:34] that is also weird
[00:40:37] but then we got Layla Layla's basically
[00:40:39] Layla is basically like
[00:40:41] Layla okay now that we have Layla if you
[00:40:44] use diona it's just a skill issue that's
[00:40:45] what Layla says Layla says hey I'm like
[00:40:47] Diana I give you a shield but instead of
[00:40:49] giving you healing I give you damage so
[00:40:51] if you're bad and knee down is healing
[00:40:53] well then you can't use me but if you
[00:40:55] don't need the healing and a Shield's
[00:40:56] enough then play me so Leila basically
[00:40:58] just calls you bad if used Iona
[00:41:01] uh Donna does have 200 em that she gives
[00:41:04] you though
[00:41:05] um with her burst
[00:41:07] and pretty good energy
[00:41:09] so there is a case to use Diana
[00:41:12] but Layla
[00:41:16] yeah download gives a lot of our energy
[00:41:18] but and stamina uh for like but if you
[00:41:21] did you don't need this [ __ ] I mean
[00:41:23] if you're still playing diona with hutao
[00:41:25] in the year of
[00:41:27] 2023 why did I took my clock to say that
[00:41:30] I mean I guess you can I don't know
[00:41:34] and movement speed for Dragon strike bat
[00:41:36] chest yeah but can you use tenacity the
[00:41:38] Millet that's what I thought that's what
[00:41:40] I thought
[00:41:42] also with diona no Donna's pretty good
[00:41:44] like I'm not cheating on that one she's
[00:41:45] decent a lot of energy mainly her
[00:41:47] Shield's kind of whatever but
[00:41:49] also the yam okay so this this yam is
[00:41:52] like the most clickbait thing ever by
[00:41:54] the way I came to this realization when
[00:41:55] I was thinking like okay how many teams
[00:41:58] actually want to use this and like okay
[00:42:00] 200 yam is like it's good
[00:42:02] but when you think about it a lot of the
[00:42:04] teams where you want to use Iona don't
[00:42:06] really need the EM so like a lot of
[00:42:07] teams where you run down when I was like
[00:42:09] a second cryo is like freeze and then
[00:42:10] you're like okay well ayaka doesn't need
[00:42:12] it in freeze Gandhi doesn't need and
[00:42:13] freeze okay what about oh melt vaporize
[00:42:17] melt right
[00:42:18] yeah loves yam okay read what this says
[00:42:21] Elemental Master increased by 200 when
[00:42:24] HP is above 50. okay does huta want to
[00:42:27] be above 50 are you gonna be above 50
[00:42:30] all the time on your towel probably
[00:42:32] [ __ ] not and you're gonna be inside
[00:42:33] of the like this is inside of the field
[00:42:35] so it's like yeah you're gonna heal up
[00:42:36] but like Kuda doesn't want to [ __ ]
[00:42:38] heal up above 50. so like a lot of the
[00:42:40] teams don't actually want this like yeah
[00:42:42] you could be like deluke or like another
[00:42:44] pyro character but yeah I feel like a
[00:42:47] lot of like this 200 em is like good but
[00:42:50] most of the teams where you're running
[00:42:51] him it doesn't or her doesn't actually
[00:42:53] do that much
[00:42:55] like yeah you're giving your Cosmo 200
[00:42:57] em sure
[00:43:02] but yeah
[00:43:09] maybe like yo Mia
[00:43:22] where am I going oh okay we have to we
[00:43:23] have to Spenders and before the day
[00:43:24] resets sorry I actually don't have did I
[00:43:26] actually I have to speed run this to
[00:43:28] this day
[00:43:32] is new battle pass sword good for crit
[00:43:34] Causeway okay
[00:43:37] look I'm not even gonna question why
[00:43:38] you're playing that because I right now
[00:43:40] my kazua is on uh 72 257 so I can
[00:43:44] understand the the the the desire to
[00:43:47] play crit Gaza uh and if that is your
[00:43:50] goal then sure
[00:43:53] it gives you crit and skill and burst
[00:43:55] damage right so it should be good yeah
[00:43:57] like obviously I recommend yam Cosmo but
[00:43:59] if you want to play crit be my guest
[00:44:06] dude Craig Cosmo is based it's fun I
[00:44:09] don't recommend it but it's fun

[01:03:56] like you've people have met me in person
[01:03:58] it's like not even it's like you're it's
[01:04:00] like at this point you're just choosing
[01:04:02] to believe a lie I don't get it
[01:04:07] whoa TCG
[01:04:09] whoa batshit
[01:04:21] all right we have to level the circuit
[01:04:22] and this ends
[01:04:37] oh
[01:04:49] this might get rid I guess
[01:04:51] don't forget to claim your battle pass
[01:04:52] weapon yeah I'm still not sure which one
[01:04:54] I want I want like a lot of them really
[01:04:56] bad
[01:05:00] no sauce I just want a lot of them
[01:05:02] except talking stick but that one's
[01:05:05] funny so
[01:05:10] okay let's just double the circuit get
[01:05:11] the greatest start effects Mr strimmer
[01:05:13] thanks man
[01:05:15] I hope so too
[01:05:17] this could get okay attack that would be
[01:05:19] good ER would be good and maybe HP
[01:05:21] percent
[01:05:22] so we're down for all three of those
[01:05:24] okay that's fine as long as we still
[01:05:26] roll a crit rate uh then we'll be happy
[01:05:28] we're just gonna do this it's gonna be
[01:05:30] two rolls in one we're gonna see crit
[01:05:31] rate go from 3.1 to 9.3 watch crit rate
[01:05:36] is now gonna go up to nine don't be
[01:05:37] surprised we still take that we still
[01:05:40] take that we still take that
[01:05:50] it could still be our best circuit
[01:05:52] though it could actually still be our
[01:05:53] best for Lenny that's fine
[01:05:57] oh X5
[01:05:59] augers
[01:06:05] yeah like if it gets crittered again
[01:06:07] it's still good
[01:06:11] foreign
[01:06:21] Bridge
[01:06:23] oh wait still good still a good Circle
[01:06:26] oh whoa whoa whoa whoa hello this is my
[01:06:29] mic okay what the hell
[01:06:30] still look yeah that was still a good
[01:06:33] circlet hey guys I have Aurora Noah
[01:06:36] Zorro and this is how I speak
[01:06:40] sorry I think my mic broke all right
[01:06:42] yeah this is good
[01:06:44] uh we're gonna lock it that's actually
[01:06:46] pretty good it's probably my best crit
[01:06:47] damage one yeah oh my what the [ __ ] is
[01:06:50] this
[01:06:51] the more skilled the player the more
[01:06:53] death rolls yeah okay actually good
[01:06:55] actually good let me time stamp that in
[01:06:59] case you make that interview like if it
[01:07:00] we use this cup
[01:07:09] not bad it's not like amazing but
[01:07:12] honest work it's not much but it's
[01:07:14] honest work what bow to use on Lenny
[01:07:16] dude my Lenny's [ __ ] we have to use
[01:07:17] like prototype crested on him because
[01:07:19] I'm gonna have too much crate when I
[01:07:21] switch to marriage we'll see I'm
[01:07:22] actually gonna have too much crit rate
[01:07:23] because I use the only bow I have a
[01:07:25] Skyward heart or prototype Crescent like
[01:07:28] I legit don't have bows for him because
[01:07:30] right now we have 90 crit rate but as
[01:07:32] soon as I go malays Jose we're [ __ ] so
[01:07:34] I don't know
[01:07:36] uh yeah here's what it is I guess
[01:07:39] we're gonna have to change bows probably
[01:07:44] should have pulled out weapon better no
[01:07:45] I I don't want like I don't want to
[01:07:57] like I don't know his bow is good and
[01:08:00] aqua's really good but I know so listen
[01:08:02] here's what I know okay I know that a
[01:08:05] lot of the fountain characters
[01:08:08] how do I say this politely
[01:08:10] a lot of the fountain characters
[01:08:13] respectfully I am waiting for
[01:08:16] and so because of that
[01:08:18] I probably am going to pull for some of
[01:08:20] their weapons like maybe noviette maybe
[01:08:22] Risley maybe [ __ ] uh uh uh Farina
[01:08:25] maybe whoever else comes out [ __ ]
[01:08:28] chlorine so it's like I would rather
[01:08:30] save the like weapons I'm gonna pull for
[01:08:33] for that than to get a crit damage bow
[01:08:35] now does that mean
[01:08:36] like I probably should get the
[01:08:38] credential because a lot of my
[01:08:39] characters could use it I don't have a
[01:08:40] single crit damage belt but it is what
[01:08:43] it is I mean I guess I had I had a block
[01:08:45] of Orba but I threw it away that was
[01:08:47] like years ago I had a black lift Forum
[01:08:49] like a 1.0 and I think or like 1.1 or
[01:08:52] something and I just I never used it so
[01:08:54] I checked it
[01:08:56] but listen I needed the XP times were
[01:08:59] tough back then I had a level 85 rust
[01:09:02] that I also threw away I needed XP dude
[01:09:04] times were tough
[01:09:06] times are tough
[01:09:12] it's in the shop yeah but like I'm not
[01:09:15] actually gonna use it and yeah I could
[01:09:17] also craft the [ __ ] blacksmith weapon
[01:09:19] uh prototype creston's pretty good if
[01:09:21] you hit a weak point
[01:09:22] the the [ __ ] Fontan Bow's not bad
[01:09:25] either
[01:09:27] I need Crystal flies or do you need
[01:09:28] resin

[01:15:21] on crit not em so I'm giving him less
[01:15:23] Buffs

[01:16:31] so getting some from your sub stats is
[01:16:32] good but you don't want to go overboard
[01:16:33] like if you have like a crit rate weapon
[01:16:36] then you want like basically none on
[01:16:37] your sub stats
[01:16:43] good
[01:16:52] also this might be a bat okay this might
[01:16:55] be a bad take this might be a bad take
[01:16:57] because Al hyphen is like this and I
[01:16:58] love how high them but I [ __ ] hate it
[01:17:00] when characters don't want to use their
[01:17:01] skill at the start like whenever your
[01:17:03] skills up I want to use it I don't care
[01:17:04] I just want to use my [ __ ] skill and
[01:17:06] then my burst and I don't want to think
[01:17:07] about it so characters that make me
[01:17:09] skill after my burst they like [ __ ] with
[01:17:11] my brain like I'll hide them you have to
[01:17:13] burst first and then you wait and then
[01:17:14] you skill Lenny you have to like do like
[01:17:16] charge shots first and then you skill
[01:17:20] it just upsets me I don't know like when
[01:17:22] I see an ability on cooldown it's like I
[01:17:24] want to use it
[01:17:26] you can skill first yeah but like
[01:17:28] are you really in a hyphen player that
[01:17:30] does hold each plunge attack and then
[01:17:32] burst maybe maybe that's you maybe
[01:17:38] that's you
[01:17:47] but it's a little cringe just a little a
[01:17:49] wee bit cringe
[01:17:52] whoa Fountain of Lucian offering rewards
[01:17:55] whoa
[01:18:00] what's with those off the map markers
[01:18:03] which ones these ones
[01:18:05] wait where oh these ones yo this is me
[01:18:08] from 3.5 haha how's the content XD
[01:18:12] did Fountain come out is the Guff the
[01:18:14] main character I knew it
[01:18:16] do you have good Vermilion yet please
[01:18:17] say yes I mean we did get a
[01:18:20] is there new co-op Rays with untreatable
[01:18:22] cosmetics and floor 15 Abyss awesome
[01:18:28] aware
[01:18:31] okay we add one every time we check it
[01:18:32] we have to add one
[01:18:41] did you find very puff yet dude I still
[01:18:43] haven't
[01:18:54] oh oh
[01:18:56] we also got a statue thing I want to go
[01:18:58] open a statue okay wait let's do two
[01:19:00] poles two pulls two pulls two pulls two
[01:19:02] pulls two pulls boom pull number one I'm
[01:19:05] thinking of Four Star
[01:19:06] okay
[01:19:07] Emerald orb boom because I guessed it
[01:19:09] chat if you say it you need to have your
[01:19:11] mic recording by the way but if your mic
[01:19:13] is recording and you say the name of the
[01:19:15] three star before it appears your next
[01:19:16] pull is guaranteed to be a four or a
[01:19:18] five star look
[01:19:22] maybe it only works on a limited banner
[01:19:23] I don't know wait how many maybe they
[01:19:25] patched it actually no matter patched it
[01:19:28] I'm not even close to pity wait what
[01:19:30] about I'm like close to a four-star
[01:19:31] video on a banner
[01:19:33] wait I'm four star pity on the character
[01:19:34] event wish

[01:19:48] is it like the [ __ ] crit rate or some

[01:19:55] what the [ __ ] is he
[01:19:57] he's level 80 so it should be around
[01:19:58] here
[01:20:00] you have so many level 80 characters
[01:20:02] holy [ __ ]
[01:20:05] yeah it is good right
[01:20:09] um
[01:20:10] I mean I don't want to do it but it is
[01:20:12] also fun to do a single pull because
[01:20:13] it's fun
[01:20:19] oh we have more
[01:20:23] okay [ __ ] it we have a free single Bowl
[01:20:25] I think we're guaranteed a four stars so
[01:20:29] um
[01:20:31] from an a baby
[01:20:35] wait what I thought that was
[01:20:37] did I not count okay well whatever uh
[01:20:40] we'll do it okay whatever I mean it is
[01:20:42] what it is I thought I counted okay well
[01:20:46] um
[01:20:52] oh yeah well now it's so this is five
[01:20:55] plus three that was eight now we did one
[01:20:57] okay fine but I'll use star glitter I
[01:20:59] don't use my actual
[01:21:00] pretty much okay we're guarantee the
[01:21:02] four star we'll get we'll get we'll get
[01:21:03] from it hey we'll be happy for me we'll
[01:21:05] be happy we're just building penny
[01:21:06] copium
[01:21:08] [ __ ] I'm not I'm done
[01:21:11] whoever you are [ __ ] you I don't care I
[01:21:13] just dude it was Gary it was guaranteed
[01:21:15] a four-star it was
[01:21:23] don't build pity kids please don't don't
[01:21:25] let this be a lesson oh my God and we
[01:21:28] won the [ __ ] 50 52. oh my God we won
[01:21:32] the [ __ ] 50 52.
[01:21:47] well at least wait is it isn't the four
[01:21:49] star still here we're guaranteed a four
[01:21:50] star now right at least now we'll get a
[01:21:52] four star wow
[01:21:54] wow from an A at least we gotta okay at
[01:21:57] least we got it from today I mean I
[01:21:59] can't complain
[01:22:00] um
[01:22:01] I can I'm actually upset about that but
[01:22:05] there you go at least you got for Renee
[01:22:09] goodbye Nevada shut up that's actually
[01:22:12] unironically though
[01:22:14] that's like minus a hundred dollars
[01:22:15] probably depending on how many pulls it
[01:22:17] oh my God why did I do that why the [ __ ]
[01:22:19] did I do that
[01:22:23] did you forget you were high pity were
[01:22:24] we oh I guess we
[01:22:27] dude I was looking at four star pity man
[01:22:29] how much pity were we got if we're at
[01:22:31] like 60 or 70 I'm gonna be mad oh we
[01:22:34] probably were oh my God we were okay
[01:22:36] well I'm stupid
[01:22:40] yeah that's 60 no it's 50. wait that's
[01:22:42] only 50 wait
[01:22:46] okay all right I've seen enough
[01:23:01] 72
[01:23:15] wait but we okay we got him right before
[01:23:17] Sophie oh I guess we did like well we
[01:23:19] only did like two single poles
[01:23:22] really they're like dude
[01:23:29] I guess we did do the 74th okay well
[01:23:32] that's unlucky
[01:23:41] dude okay it wasn't like I was trying to
[01:23:43] build pity obviously I don't do that but
[01:23:44] I was like I want I have one free pull
[01:23:47] and I'm not gonna save it because I'm
[01:23:49] addicted I'm not gonna spend my own
[01:23:50] Primo gems but if I get a free pull I
[01:23:53] have to use it I can't see this being
[01:23:55] higher than zero I'm sorry I'm not gonna
[01:23:56] spend the gems but I'll spend the free
[01:23:58] pool it's free
[01:24:00] and that's like minus 100 probably but
[01:24:03] whatever
[01:24:12] um
[01:24:14] I kind of don't want to activate the I
[01:24:16] have
[01:24:18] okay Alice the reason why I pulled for
[01:24:20] drawing they're not child is because
[01:24:26] I could
[01:24:28] I could see to him and then I okay I
[01:24:31] actually use my burst but I kind of
[01:24:32] don't want to because it's like
[01:24:46] I don't know
[01:24:51] see to him he's child's father
[01:24:54] I mean what about oh yeah Petra
[01:24:58] that's why I'm on black tassel
[01:25:01] maybe one day but then we'd have to go
[01:25:04] homo and then if I go home alone I guess
[01:25:06] I could go fast too
[01:25:09] I guess we could go five
[01:25:21] this kind of matches him
[01:25:35] you have his signature dude his
[01:25:37] signature isn't even good for dude like
[01:25:39] it's not even his weapon dude it's
[01:25:41] literally not even his weapon
[01:25:54] foreign
[01:25:56] foreign
[01:25:59] wait where is it
[01:26:07] uh I mean I guess the I guess the
[01:26:09] xenophobic phobic pole arm matches him
[01:26:12] but
[01:26:13] it's not even that good it's just yeah
[01:26:16] if we do get it we'd probably homo maybe
[01:26:18] five it's probably still five but I kind
[01:26:20] of don't wanna dude I don't have enough
[01:26:21] Fabs leveled I need to level more Fabs I
[01:26:23] guess Yaya could use a level one five
[01:26:25] because she doesn't need the attack
[01:26:27] so it doesn't really matter
[01:26:34] we're gonna go do a boss why do I have a
[01:26:37] portable Waypoint here
[01:26:46] okay what if I dirge
[01:26:57] actually wait do I even have resin wait
[01:26:59] a second okay never mind
[01:27:01] well those but don't condensed really
[01:27:04] have condensed right
[01:27:06] no I don't well that is awkward
[01:27:09] foreign
[01:27:36] but if like the odds of them releasing a
[01:27:39] metaphysical character that wants
[01:27:41] Bennett is pretty low so it's up to you
[01:27:43] it only ruins like two teams three
[01:27:45] doesn't really matter
[01:27:48] depends on who you play or who you plan
[01:27:50] on playing
[01:28:06] it also lets you do some fun things like
[01:28:07] you can play thundering furry you can
[01:28:09] play a razor with it and you play Pyro
[01:28:10] razor you could also play wait wait
[01:28:12] listen to the song today oh I'm playing
[01:28:14] a different playlist than normal
[01:28:18] my bad
[01:28:22] I was like why did it Loop
[01:28:28] 36 with Daya challenge it's actually not
[01:28:30] hard
[01:28:31] did my day is insane you guys are
[01:28:33] actually already do you want me for the
[01:28:34] day I'll play Dale you guys are actually
[01:28:35] ready for my day my day is so good
[01:28:40] um

[01:28:49] one I was about to put this one on
[01:28:54] EU 128
[01:29:05] what if I do this
[01:29:18] why the [ __ ] am I not
[01:29:22] um
[01:29:25] to my Vermillion flowers are so bad dude
[01:29:29] I mean they're not that bad like this is
[01:29:30] pretty good but
[01:29:32] I suppose they were better
[01:29:56] you
[01:30:01] don't want to work enough actually let's
[01:30:04] so we could just helmet
[01:30:07] no that's worse
[01:30:22] after getting a five star dude I didn't
[01:30:24] want another Zhang Lee because I know
[01:30:26] what's called dude I know the the the
[01:30:29] the the characters that are coming soon
[01:30:32] so I would rather have them than another
[01:30:35] [ __ ] Jonathan
[01:30:48] how do you know do they drip marketed
[01:30:50] they literally 3.1 drip marketed like
[01:30:52] [ __ ] weeks ago it's not like we don't
[01:30:55] know
[01:30:58] it's okay it'll be better content it'll
[01:31:00] be better content if I'm pulling and
[01:31:01] it's a yeah a 4.1 whatever you know what
[01:31:04] dude

[01:31:44] gonna come
[01:31:45] maybe not who knows actually probably
[01:31:47] not oh I'm lucky uh who else could play
[01:32:00] actually I think it's on Skyward blade
[01:32:14] we could play from an A
[01:32:16] that could happen
[01:32:18] uh we could do we could do freemony
[01:32:20] again from an async show

[01:33:28] this attack you can actually react to it
[01:33:29] if you're far enough boom I just okay I
[01:33:31] took damage but usually you can react to
[01:33:32] it if you're far enough if you're close

[01:35:09] lift she's like best in spot support
[01:35:22] what is this guy over here
[01:35:24] level one child is a better support dude
[01:35:30] surely one plunge level isn't as good as
[01:35:32] resistance Interruption Wolf's
[01:35:35] gravestone attack buff tenacity of the
[01:35:37] middle of attack buff pyro resonance for
[01:35:39] 20 true
[01:35:44] because you use Tomah C6 and that team a
[01:35:47] lot because Tomo gives you plunge damage
[01:35:49] and uh Power resonance
[01:35:52] we're good
[01:36:08] can I hit this fucker's [ __ ] or no

[01:36:41] me get the particles before we kill him
[01:36:42] how we kill him
[01:36:43] cool
[01:36:53] it's fine we're chilling
[01:37:05] well Xiao is uh very good here
[01:37:14] let me just set out for Daya
[01:37:19] okay so far so good
[01:37:25] no no
[01:37:27] that was pretty good for now
[01:37:34] all right top three
[01:37:38] quarters
[01:37:44] oh that was bad these guys are gonna die
[01:37:46] backwards no no no no that's this way no
[01:37:48] that's his way cool
[01:37:56] don't you dare get your Shield don't you
[01:37:59] [Music]
[01:38:01] think
[01:38:05] I'll throw a [ __ ] Penguin on you
[01:38:07] don't I
[01:38:08] don't test me
[01:38:10] wait this is actually fine this actually
[01:38:11] fine
[01:38:17] oh this one that's the one that doesn't
[01:38:18] group [ __ ] I went to the wrong one
[01:38:24] I barked up the wrong tree oh no
[01:38:32] I need energy I have to wait
[01:38:34] foreign
[01:39:03] [Music]
[01:39:11] I can do one more no I can't I'm
[01:39:13] swapping
[01:39:23] well uh my first one's not on Fab so we
[01:39:27] are never getting child's birth back
[01:39:28] just so you guys know
[01:39:32] why would a horizon not be on Fab in any
[01:39:35] circumstance ever I don't know that is a
[01:39:37] good question
[01:39:41] Dale
[01:39:51] yeah this boss is really high anywhere
[01:39:54] else because we do normally do like
[01:39:56] twice as much
[01:39:58] almost
[01:40:05] why'd I just Auto attack on fires on
[01:40:12] we got wolf of Grace on
[01:40:15] okay I'm gonna play shot like kutao
[01:40:17] wait no
[01:40:19] the dash cancel
[01:40:27] that was fun
[01:40:35] that was fun
[01:40:36] wait I haven't played nilo in this event
[01:40:38] I just realized I usually knew every
[01:40:39] Abyss I guess she must be dude ew wait
[01:40:42] what about second half no ew you need
[01:40:44] you wait Can you though because here is
[01:40:47] one enemy here's one enemy and then here
[01:40:49] she's probably good but then second half
[01:40:51] this is kind of ew
[01:40:53] I mean I guess this one's fine but this
[01:40:55] could have a cryo shield and then this
[01:40:56] one's kind of you and then this one's
[01:40:58] kind of you
[01:41:00] first half yeah but you're single
[01:41:01] targeting I mean I I guess it still
[01:41:03] works but I mean you could probably do
[01:41:05] like you could probably do like a Nila
[01:41:07] team where Neil is not even niluing or
[01:41:09] you just do like single Target Hydro
[01:41:12] single Target Hydro no probably only one
[01:41:14] actually oh you're like
[01:41:17] I like this and you just kneelo
[01:41:21] yeah that would probably work
[01:41:37] yeah well because it's yeah
[01:41:41] that's fine yeah I mean yeah I mean sure
[01:41:44] if you want all your blooms to just not

[01:43:15] immune immune
[01:43:21] okay well
[01:43:30] wait Chad do you guys think we have
[01:43:32] leftover artifacts
[01:43:34] chat chat do you think are you thinking
[01:43:36] what I'm thinking Chad are you thinking
[01:43:38] what I'm thinking Chad are you thinking
[01:43:40] what I'm thinking Chad are you thinking
[01:43:41] what I'm thinking
[01:43:44] are you thinking what I'm thinking or no
[01:43:46] be honest yes or no are you thinking
[01:43:47] what I'm thinking or no just be honest
[01:43:50] because I'm thinking uh we could get a
[01:43:53] shoutpiece
[01:43:55] gig wait go get a showpiece
[01:43:57] but it's just like we could we could
[01:44:00] also not get one but we could get one
[01:44:01] and that fills me with determination
[01:44:06] uh this could be good
[01:44:07] this could be good okay
[01:44:09] why do I keep getting feathers
[01:44:12] why do
[01:44:13] do do is a feather a different drop rate
[01:44:16] than a flower to the same [ __ ] thing
[01:44:18] with the same [ __ ] fixed main stat
[01:44:20] why can't I just get this on a flower
[01:44:24] my feathers used to be bad and now I've
[01:44:26] got it like 18.
[01:44:29] it's fine I'm not gonna complain we'll
[01:44:31] try to get it we'll roll it
[01:44:41] dude I have one two three four five six
[01:44:44] seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[01:44:46] thirteen thirteen plus twenty locked
[01:44:48] Vermillion uh feathers locked ones these
[01:44:52] are the ones that I kept imagine how
[01:44:53] many I threw away imagine how many
[01:44:55] feathers alone I threw away and I kept
[01:44:58] 14.
[01:45:00] foreign
[01:45:03] like 49 crit value though wait what wait
[01:45:06] wait you're not talking about this one
[01:45:07] are you
[01:45:09] the the okay let's do the math here six
[01:45:11] times two six point two times two that
[01:45:13] is 12.4
[01:45:15] 12.4 crit rate or like crit value from
[01:45:17] the crit rate and then 23.3 could value
[01:45:20] from liquid damage
[01:45:22] yeah that is not even 40.
[01:45:28] but my feather is really my feathers are
[01:45:31] already really good like this is the new
[01:45:33] one we just got and the current one is
[01:45:35] uh this one that I'm usually using and I
[01:45:37] also have this one
[01:45:39] yeah
[01:45:41] I don't know what that laugh was I'm
[01:45:42] sorry
[01:45:51] anyways
[01:45:55] we're gonna roll this either
[01:45:58] let's see what happens
[01:46:16] [ __ ] you [ __ ] you I hate you I hate you
[01:46:18] I hate you [ __ ] I mean it doesn't matter
[01:46:21] it's fine we already had a good feather
[01:46:23] [ __ ] this game though I mean
[01:46:29] chat be honest should I keep this so
[01:46:31] technically this could be better for my
[01:46:33] Linney who needs attack more than he
[01:46:34] needs crit rate okay we'll keep it wait
[01:46:36] which piece can I throw which piece can
[01:46:37] I throw surely there's a feather I can
[01:46:39] throw right
[01:46:41] can I throw this one
[01:46:57] no wait why not
[01:47:00] throw the 20 Attack One
[01:47:03] this one yeah this one's this looks kind
[01:47:05] of funny though
[01:47:11] okay I'll throw this on this will be
[01:47:14] better
[01:47:21] uh
[01:47:22] um
[01:47:24] that looks identical to the feather we
[01:47:26] just threw away
[01:47:29] I mean if it rolls crit damage or crit
[01:47:31] rate it could actually be
[01:47:43] we hit 777 we're lucky
[01:47:46] wait that means the next if you hit 777
[01:47:49] flat HP it guarantees that the next
[01:47:51] artifact you roll Only Hits crit so
[01:47:53] choose your next artifact wisely choose
[01:47:55] your next artifact wisely I'll show it
[01:47:57] right now look I'll prove it to you guys
[01:47:59] watch watch this the next if you throw
[01:48:01] the 777 into a piece it only rolls good
[01:48:04] saswatch I'll prove it to you guys right
[01:48:06] now
[01:48:07] I told you crit and attack
[01:48:10] wait wait a second this is actually good
[01:48:12] unironically good unironically good
[01:48:14] unironically good
[01:48:17] unironically good
[01:48:19] it even gave us attack from nowhere
[01:48:26] Paul trap
[01:48:29] oh wait this is not bad
[01:48:32] wait this is not bad this is just decent
[01:48:37] this is wait actually not bad 10.5
[01:48:39] create and 14 attack not bad
[01:48:43] actually really good it only missed like
[01:48:45] you know it's actually really good yeah
[01:48:46] this is really good
[01:48:49] maybe better than your current one
[01:48:50] what's my current one
[01:48:51] ah dude uh maybe maybe it might be it
[01:48:55] might be oh [ __ ]
[01:49:01] I'm gonna have to use the optimizer if I
[01:49:02] actually want to think about it but it's
[01:49:04] two attack rolls instead of one crit
[01:49:06] roll so it could be
[01:49:10] they're pretty similar
[01:49:12] they're pretty similar
[01:49:19] 40 em
[01:49:21] Ma
[01:49:22] sorry that was weird
[01:49:24] um
[01:49:26] Mr socks I have a question Elemental
[01:49:30] Master Rio time
[01:49:34] you already at 90 crit rate
[01:49:37] um I mean we have like a million flowers
[01:49:39] so the crit rate I'm at varies
[01:49:42] I actually wonder which flower is my
[01:49:44] best
[01:49:46] probably this one if I don't this one if
[01:49:47] I don't need the r but then that is too
[01:49:49] much crit rate
[01:49:50] but if I can use the ER then this one's
[01:49:53] the best I think
[01:49:55] wait this one's not bad either
[01:50:00] yeah I hate this game
[01:50:08] it's also not bad
[01:50:10] wait what I just don't know
[01:50:13] let's talk about a question or power
[01:50:16] goblet for shangling uh Pyro
[01:50:19] yam can be a decent Sans though but yeah
[01:50:31] okay let me actually see
[01:50:34] where we're on the wrong sends for sure
[01:50:37] this sense has to be better
[01:50:40] damn did we actually get a new circuit
[01:50:42] dude [ __ ] man why do I dude I am so mad
[01:50:46] that this is Vermillion if this is like
[01:50:48] dude if my shout already had a good
[01:50:50] Vermillion and I could be farming emblem
[01:50:51] imagine how many how having so many good
[01:50:54] emblem circuits would be like useful
[01:50:56] but now I have like two of the same
[01:50:58] circlet
[01:50:59] that can only be used on one character
[01:51:02] it's fine
[01:51:07] I mean
[01:51:11] wait what is my attack I mean we have so
[01:51:13] much [ __ ] attack though from Bennett
[01:51:16] and Vermilion and no bless
[01:51:21] let me go in a pirate resonance team
[01:51:23] because that's what we're gonna be
[01:51:24] playing
[01:51:32] we go from
[01:51:38] two four oh one to two four ninety
[01:51:42] okay
[01:51:51] well
[01:51:57] we got uh we got a piece
[01:52:16] 105.8 I mean that's what my shower used
[01:52:19] to look like I'm actually not even
[01:52:20] against it
[01:52:23] um
[01:52:35] too many [ __ ] builds dude
[01:52:42] how do we get more em the star of yam
[01:52:44] [ __ ] I didn't see it
[01:52:47] I need less dude I actually don't want
[01:52:49] to see this much em on my shower it's
[01:52:51] like triggering me even if it's not bad
[01:53:09] yeah this is probably the best one still
[01:53:15] um
[01:53:24] okay I mean we got an upgrade that
[01:53:27] actually is not bad it's actually not
[01:53:29] I'm actually pretty happy with that
[01:53:31] how many time snap it
[01:53:34] foreign
[01:54:02] good here
[01:54:04] uh
[01:54:05] uh fine
[01:54:09] boom I like it
[01:54:13] well we have no artifacts
[01:54:22] should we play count mod check
[01:54:26] okay we could swap
[01:54:36] we could stop we can stop
[01:54:39] fine
[01:54:40] [Music]
[01:54:56] do attack goblet no we just have a power
[01:54:58] resonance team so we have more like did
[01:55:01] we get so much I actually don't even
[01:55:02] know if the attack's better than the
[01:55:03] crit rate we're gonna have to check
[01:55:04] because we get no blast we got Bennett
[01:55:06] we get Pi resonance and we get
[01:55:09] Vermillion so we got like literally
[01:55:10] infinite attack
[01:55:15] but no
[01:55:29] maybe we go back to the domain
[01:55:37] the two of this video is pretty good at
[01:55:38] ziox thanks man it was a very important
[01:55:41] list
[01:55:45] he benched Sino no I didn't I didn't
[01:55:49] look look look look proof that I didn't

[01:55:53] weapon he's on the right set he's he's
[01:55:55] he's crowned double and good ratio
[01:55:59] true you just have a bit more ER though
[01:56:02] but
[01:56:03] yeah
[01:56:05] only my circle is wrong usually I'm on
[01:56:07] like another [ __ ] but yeah
[01:56:13] wait was my Sans attack
[01:56:17] no it's not
[01:56:25] yo this is actually good though this is
[01:56:27] actually good though it's actually good
[01:56:32] it's actually good
[01:56:34] it's dude this is actually not even bad
[01:56:37] actually a good ratio
[01:56:45] that's the best the benched crit ratio
[01:56:48] I've ever seen dude it's not benched
[01:56:51] he's not Ben she's [ __ ] He's French
[01:56:54] of 10. I can't use him for Dom

[02:07:48] [ __ ] Exquisite chest

[02:07:52] want to fight him actually that would

[02:09:15] have to leave soon anyways like in an
[02:09:16] hour-ish so we might as well go to the
[02:09:18] free Play account
[02:09:21] also I'm streaming at 5 30 a.m so it's
[02:09:25] probably a good time to
[02:09:27] think about my life choices
[02:09:36] the problem with my
[02:09:38] into it I I look at it I'm like okay
[02:09:40] guys we're gonna play this account now
[02:09:42] and then I don't play it and then I log
[02:09:44] back in three weeks later and I say the
[02:09:46] same thing
[02:09:51] but if I make a video on my and then I
[02:09:54] hold myself accountable I'll make a
[02:09:55] video being like I will fix this account
[02:09:57] and then that'll be a second Channel
[02:09:58] video and then when I fully finish it
[02:10:00] it'll be a main Channel like
[02:10:01] transformation video and then boom
[02:10:10] foreign
[02:10:33] no not more well actually yes no it was
[02:10:35] only [ __ ] yeah that's way more
[02:10:36] there's only [ __ ] 1500.
[02:11:00] I wanted to eat wait chat after how long
[02:11:03] do you get the [ __ ] um the like
[02:11:06] blessed Stellar journey is it two weeks
[02:11:08] or like more
[02:11:09] if there's a world quest here [ __ ]
[02:11:12] no way it's under me
[02:11:17] two weeks okay absolutely nothing
[02:11:28] all right let me stop accounts
[02:11:32] one sec
[02:11:40] two weeks but there's a bigger Gap in
[02:11:42] between each one oh really is that a
[02:11:44] thing
[02:11:59] I don't think so I don't know I actually
[02:12:01] don't know
[02:12:03] foreign
[02:12:18] all right we'll figure this out later
[02:12:22] um
[02:12:23] capped okay but bro we if I open my
[02:12:26] event page look
[02:12:27] yeah we haven't all right listen
[02:12:31] let's just say
[02:12:33] let's just say
[02:12:35] today will Mark history as the day we
[02:12:38] actually fix this account we actually
[02:12:40] start building it repairing it and
[02:12:42] mending it because it's a good base
[02:12:46] and you'll see okay usually what happens
[02:12:48] okay let me let me catch you guys up to
[02:12:50] speed we have I have
[02:12:53] an Asia account
[02:12:54] the count is AR 46
[02:12:59] and we've had it since version 1.0 okay
[02:13:01] I re-rolled in version 1.0 or actually
[02:13:04] on Albedo's Banner which is 1.2
[02:13:08] but the account was made in 1.0 proof of
[02:13:10] this is that our Bennett is on a
[02:13:11] refinement Rank 2 festering desire
[02:13:14] ain't no [ __ ] way
[02:13:18] but
[02:13:21] um
[02:13:22] yeah and for the record we don't have R5
[02:13:24] because I was too lazy I I actually
[02:13:27] don't have more so yeah uh it is what it
[02:13:30] is though anyways
[02:13:32] uh yeah
[02:13:35] so this account is definitely an account
[02:13:38] uh but it's a good Baseline we have Xiao
[02:13:41] and our Xiao has a c0 farzan that we
[02:13:44] pulled recently to go alongside him so
[02:13:46] we get to actually feel the free-to-play
[02:13:48] experience and actually embrace it and
[02:13:51] rejoice in it so what we're gonna do is
[02:13:53] transform this account from wherever it
[02:13:55] is now to a perfect Abyss clearing God
[02:13:58] Mammoth of a account spending resin
[02:14:01] wisely and doing things efficiently
[02:14:05] and basically what happens is every
[02:14:07] couple of weeks every couple of months
[02:14:09] every couple of patches I log into this
[02:14:11] account I say oh we're gonna play it now
[02:14:13] for real and then I end up not playing
[02:14:15] it this time we're actually gonna play
[02:14:17] it now for real
[02:14:21] We're Not Gonna spend money on the
[02:14:23] account We're not gonna do anything dumb
[02:14:25] we're just gonna be smart and I'm going
[02:14:26] to save my Primo yams save my Primo oh
[02:14:29] my God that took so long to load I'm
[02:14:31] Gonna Save My Primo gems for a fontanian
[02:14:33] character that I like
[02:14:35] now to show you guys what this account
[02:14:37] has
[02:14:38] let me show you
[02:14:42] show up in the mail I'm afraid
[02:14:45] pretty much
[02:14:49] to show you guys what this account has
[02:14:53] we have a level 70 Xiao on a black lift
[02:14:56] pole which is a great free-to-play
[02:14:57] option for him
[02:14:59] he is level six two five now you might
[02:15:01] be exhaust why don't you get more time
[02:15:02] levels because I don't have slime
[02:15:04] secretions I have the talent books I
[02:15:07] have not killed slimes now look okay I
[02:15:11] have reviewed this account like six
[02:15:12] times without progressing it and then I
[02:15:14] just forget to play it and then I keep
[02:15:16] doing the same thing over and over but
[02:15:17] this time is going to be the last time
[02:15:19] so I'm gonna go in detail again so I can
[02:15:21] upload it and then people will be like
[02:15:22] oh [ __ ] he means business this time true
[02:15:25] anyways uh so yeah we have we have you
[02:15:27] know the same thing with our sucrose
[02:15:29] um but she's on thrilling Tails it is
[02:15:31] what it is level 40 again we can't
[02:15:33] Ascend her because we don't have a
[02:15:34] Whopper flower nectar
[02:15:36] but we'll get it soon so it's okay
[02:15:39] um
[02:15:41] uh yeah so this is all the accounts we
[02:15:44] have sucrose already again so we have
[02:15:46] Bennett see [ __ ] six by the way I
[02:15:48] don't know how I don't I literally I
[02:15:51] remember I pulled on the first Albedo
[02:15:52] Banner
[02:15:53] which was official Bennett and someone
[02:15:56] else and we got a bunch of Bandits a
[02:15:58] bunch of the someone else's and none of
[02:15:59] the officials
[02:16:01] uh and then we ended up getting Albedo
[02:16:02] before official I just wanted official
[02:16:06] we official
[02:16:08] um
[02:16:09] oh ourselves actually pretty cracked by
[02:16:10] the way
[02:16:11] okay let's look at the characters first
[02:16:13] we have okay we actually have a lot of
[02:16:15] characters because I would like claim
[02:16:17] Primos every patch and then just not
[02:16:18] play so we have ciao
[02:16:21] we have Albedo we have Eula from her
[02:16:23] first Banner
[02:16:25] uh we have Mona who I re-rolled for we
[02:16:27] rerolled for mono
[02:16:29] uh and harp
[02:16:31] and we have Kuching
[02:16:35] not even Max stamina
[02:16:41] shut the [ __ ] up
[02:16:44] all right whatever uh anyways uh yeah so
[02:16:48] we have those characters and then we
[02:16:49] have pretty good four stars we have a
[02:16:50] Shang Ling we have a level 20 sing show
[02:16:53] who we level official we have a beta who
[02:16:56] I believe is C2 yeah C3
[02:17:00] um
[02:17:01] and there's a lot we can do with this
[02:17:03] account
[02:17:06] so our shower is actually pretty cracked
[02:17:08] because we have Blacklist and we also
[02:17:11] have uh two verdescent and two Berserker
[02:17:13] right now which inflates his ratio to be
[02:17:15] 67 176 which is actually good for a
[02:17:19] level 70 AR 45 shell
[02:17:21] uh with that in mind you might be
[02:17:23] exhaust why the [ __ ] do you have two uh
[02:17:24] a lot of [ __ ] you have a Vermillion
[02:17:25] piece well we may have entered the
[02:17:27] Vermilion domain and we have a really
[02:17:29] good Vermillion flower that's like
[02:17:30] low-key better than my Mains
[02:17:33] um so we might have to get another piece
[02:17:34] but we can use strong box so it's fine
[02:17:37] and then we have a really good Vanessa
[02:17:38] Venom or feather we have a really good
[02:17:40] redesigns and now all we need is a
[02:17:42] circlet or a goblet and we're chilling
[02:17:51] and then
[02:17:52] what we're gonna do is be efficient so I
[02:17:55] did this last time we're gonna do this
[02:17:56] again where I'm gonna be efficient in
[02:17:58] the sense of
[02:17:59] look we're transforming an account
[02:18:01] that's pretty garbage to an account it's
[02:18:03] gonna be amazing we're gonna do it where
[02:18:04] we are we just are I'm telling you
[02:18:07] so what do you want to do are you going
[02:18:08] to build every character no you're not
[02:18:10] going to be dumb we're gonna we're gonna
[02:18:11] we're gonna why does sometimes you are
[02:18:13] fun to watch on mute
[02:18:15] sorry I got distracted we're gonna build
[02:18:18] only eight characters We're not gonna
[02:18:19] build more than we need so as
[02:18:22] I always do we have to dedicate specific
[02:18:25] teams and only build those specific
[02:18:28] names those eight characters now with
[02:18:30] that in mind I'm pretty sure we got
[02:18:31] Lynette for free somewhere where the
[02:18:33] [ __ ] is Lynette oh there she is
[02:18:36] [Music]
[02:18:38] fingers
[02:18:43] um
[02:18:44] you feel the net
[02:18:46] the magic begin
[02:18:51] Abyss Moon
[02:18:52] summary 2021
[02:18:56] wait why does it show 2021 is that the
[02:18:58] last okay
[02:19:01] [Laughter]
[02:19:07] full stars on seven or eight by the way
[02:19:09] so uh
[02:19:13] anyways
[02:19:16] anyways we're gonna get through it we're
[02:19:19] gonna get through it uh so let me talk
[02:19:22] about what we're gonna do so we did a
[02:19:23] poll last time I got on this account of
[02:19:26] what should our teams be and my
[02:19:28] conclusion was we're gonna play Xiao
[02:19:29] farzan sucrose Bennett
[02:19:32] or a Nemo MC Bennett or Lynette Bennett
[02:19:36] whatever just another Nemo character
[02:19:38] because as far as on c0 usually want
[02:19:40] another new one then our second half
[02:19:41] we're gonna play some Denver team so
[02:19:44] we're either gonna do kaching uh with
[02:19:46] Fishel or we're gonna do Beto official
[02:19:50] um
[02:19:52] I don't know which one I would rather
[02:19:53] play uh the thing is if we do let's say
[02:19:56] we do we don't have Denver characters
[02:19:57] other than MC or kolei so if we do play
[02:20:00] kaching we're gonna have to do dentro MC
[02:20:04] official and then the last lot's gonna
[02:20:07] have to be like
[02:20:09] sucrose and then we have no healer or
[02:20:11] literally not even kidding Barbara and
[02:20:13] then we get like random hyper blooms
[02:20:16] alternatively we play sucrose official
[02:20:21] Beto Centro
[02:20:23] so I'm not really sure
[02:20:29] call it yeah you could also like call it
[02:20:30] with kaching but our colleague's gonna
[02:20:31] be like c0 no weapon because our fatbo
[02:20:34] is going to be on
[02:20:36] um
[02:20:38] far is on
[02:20:45] didn't we do a poll yes but okay here's
[02:20:47] the problem the last time I played this
[02:20:49] account is
[02:20:51] so long ago that
[02:20:54] I'm pretty sure the vod's not even here
[02:20:56] anymore it might be I'm pretty sure it's
[02:20:58] been over I'm pretty sure the VOD got
[02:21:00] Auto deleted
[02:21:05] so we're gonna have to redo it
[02:21:10] um
[02:21:10] anyways I want to play farzan because I
[02:21:13] want to witness the like I want to feel
[02:21:15] the c0 free to play farzan experience oh
[02:21:18] also we're on 200 ping 226. so it's
[02:21:21] gonna be it's gonna be great
[02:21:24] um yeah it's gonna be great
[02:21:30] so anyways this is happening no matter
[02:21:32] what uh and then our last slot will just
[02:21:34] be a Nemo character
[02:21:36] uh we could actually do Lynette with a
[02:21:38] sack sword it's actually not even a bad
[02:21:39] take because it's a lot of energy
[02:21:42] um sucrose is better because throwing
[02:21:43] Tails but
[02:21:45] I mean when that is cool it lets us use
[02:21:48] sucrose here for taser but I don't know
[02:21:50] if we're gonna play taser
[02:21:54] we're not playing strangling I mean we
[02:21:56] could play like reverse mouth but then
[02:21:57] shall loses Bennett so I don't want to
[02:21:59] do that
[02:22:02] but anyways when you are like committing
[02:22:05] to dude a lot of people like yo zox my
[02:22:07] account is is terrible how do I make it
[02:22:09] better okay you have to like specialize
[02:22:11] in two teams if you're like building
[02:22:12] every character all your characters are
[02:22:14] gonna [ __ ] suck unless you're like
[02:22:15] super late game so that's why like I
[02:22:17] don't think we have enough to invest in
[02:22:18] like literally everyone and I want to
[02:22:20] play Xiao and he's also pretty good as a
[02:22:22] hyper carry so the other one we're gonna
[02:22:23] use could be Eula but I don't play YULA
[02:22:25] could be well also Eula is EULA so Keck
[02:22:27] W I also could play [ __ ] uh Beto or
[02:22:31] kaching I'm probably gonna pick one of
[02:22:32] them you could play them together but I
[02:22:34] kind of want to play official so we're
[02:22:35] gonna bench one of them
[02:22:37] um
[02:22:40] I think the the three team options we
[02:22:43] have are taser
[02:22:47] we have taser as an option we have bench
[02:22:50] Beto here and then put a dendro
[02:22:51] character
[02:22:52] uh like MC or Cole and then have like
[02:22:55] some hyper blue or
[02:22:57] or we could do just [ __ ] kitchen and
[02:22:59] then kitchen would probably want
[02:23:01] uh dendro and then if we need a Healer
[02:23:04] which we probably will
[02:23:05] then we would want Barbara because we
[02:23:07] don't have Yahoo
[02:23:09] or gene or say you or like
[02:23:12] [ __ ] Kirara or baiju
[02:23:16] so I don't actually know
[02:23:21] um
[02:23:22] I don't think it matters I think kaching
[02:23:25] and Beto perform like similarly
[02:23:26] depending on what the abyss is
[02:23:28] uh I am down to play a four-star team
[02:23:31] though
[02:23:35] also a benefit of a team like this is
[02:23:38] all of these characters oh then we don't
[02:23:40] have a single dendro team
[02:23:42] but a benefit of a team like this is uh
[02:23:44] all these characters are good and any
[02:23:46] team I make ever except maybe beta like
[02:23:48] beta is pretty flexible but like sync
[02:23:50] show is good in every team fishel's
[02:23:51] gonna every team Supergirl's good on
[02:23:52] every team basically so it's like
[02:24:03] don't you have to go soon shut the [ __ ]
[02:24:04] up we have to figure this out first
[02:24:07] we could play okay I think we do play
[02:24:09] dendro I think I do play I mean I could
[02:24:11] just play DMC
[02:24:16] you could play this but then I have no
[02:24:19] healer dude no way you guys think I can
[02:24:21] play without a Healer also this isn't
[02:24:23] even that much dangerous I mean it's
[02:24:24] okay I'm on a denture I guess
[02:24:27] you could just Infuse the [ __ ] DMC
[02:24:29] burst
[02:24:31] taser is good taser is really good the
[02:24:34] problem with Taser though the only
[02:24:35] problem with Taser is that we now I mean
[02:24:38] I guess we don't need dendro I just kind
[02:24:40] of want to play a dendro team but it's
[02:24:41] not even [ __ ] Subaru patch anymore I
[02:24:44] literally skipped Sumer on this account
[02:24:52] play Hydro Traveler
[02:24:56] that is the take
[02:25:03] laughs
[02:25:09] okay we get dude what if we play
[02:25:11] xiaofarazan and then taser and then
[02:25:14] maybe if we need dendro for an abyss we
[02:25:16] Flex in DMC instead of like Beto and
[02:25:19] then boom we have a denture team
[02:25:22] bro this is floor eight it's not okay
[02:25:24] we're making teams for every [ __ ]
[02:25:27] floor no one builds their teams for one
[02:25:29] floor unless it's 12. but like we're
[02:25:31] just we're building for 12. we you you
[02:25:33] have to dude you have to fake it till
[02:25:36] you have to think of where you about
[02:25:37] where you want to be not where you
[02:25:39] currently are being
[02:25:41] also this is our map right now we don't
[02:25:43] even have the emblem domain unlocked but
[02:25:45] we probably don't even actually oh we do
[02:25:46] have it unlocked wait I lied wait no I
[02:25:48] don't wait do I where the [ __ ] is emblem
[02:25:50] oh it's here okay we do have it unlocked
[02:25:52] nevermind I lied
[02:25:53] we have it unlocked what don't I have
[02:25:55] unlocked I don't have
[02:26:00] a flop
[02:26:04] it's fine we'll get it soon
[02:26:06] wait this is what the map looks like now
[02:26:08] [ __ ]
[02:26:10] well there you go
[02:26:15] play one thousand six hundred why are
[02:26:17] your characters level 20 because I don't
[02:26:19] feel like farming for uh not so we're
[02:26:22] gonna have to do this
[02:26:23] So the plan okay here's the plan and
[02:26:26] this is gonna happen on stream but also
[02:26:27] off stream okay trust me this is the fun
[02:26:29] we're gonna I am going to okay I'm I'm
[02:26:32] literally going to and there's no excuse
[02:26:34] not watch watch watch unless we fully
[02:26:35] give up on the account but watch we're
[02:26:37] gonna okay we're gonna level every
[02:26:39] character's talents first and level them
[02:26:41] we're gonna level them and their talents
[02:26:43] then level their weapons as well so then
[02:26:45] we have all of the guaranteed upgrades
[02:26:46] and then we'll go artifact farming we
[02:26:49] want artifact Farm until our bases are
[02:26:51] covered okay trust me next time you see
[02:26:53] the show his normal attacks gonna be
[02:26:55] like at least level eight
[02:26:57] and and and we already have a decent
[02:27:01] amount of weapons we have [ __ ] heart
[02:27:02] for some reason we have black lift pole
[02:27:04] we have two favonis warbows we have a
[02:27:07] sack sword R1 which is pretty terrible
[02:27:09] but it is what it is uh uh uh uh our
[02:27:11] Bennett can get the free-to-play [ __ ]
[02:27:13] sapwood blade
[02:27:15] and our sucrose already has a sack Frags
[02:27:22] so there's literally no excuse
[02:27:25] why is chow swimming
[02:27:29] that is a good question
[02:27:31] yeah
[02:27:35] you have to do aranara for sapwood oh my
[02:27:38] God okay we are not doing sapwood okay
[02:27:41] yo surely ronkers enough right Rancor is
[02:27:43] the same base attack
[02:27:45] rocker is enough right we just lose ER
[02:27:47] but
[02:27:58] also because we're not using Shang Ling
[02:28:00] this means we don't need to farm for the
[02:28:02] catch
[02:28:14] did you just don't get to tell us what
[02:28:15] you're never gonna do instead of
[02:28:16] actually doing it yes but I will do it
[02:28:19] we I will dude next time we log into
[02:28:22] this account there's gonna be progress
[02:28:23] already made there's gonna be so much

[02:28:34] what if we Farm yeah what if we farm for
[02:28:36] end of the line
