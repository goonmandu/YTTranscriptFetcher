[00:11:19] anyways
[00:11:22] um yeah so we're just going to play

[00:11:30] uh uh uh uh uh ID reviews you like your
[00:11:33] own videos if you don't like what you
[00:11:34] make who's going to like it how can you
[00:11:35] expect others to like what you don't
[00:11:36] like laugh at your own
[00:11:41] jokes you look like junk cook true you
[00:11:45] no one wrote that but be
[00:11:47] F so that's the plan um dude chat you
[00:11:51] guys literally threw me under the bus I
[00:11:53] literally while I was streaming
[00:11:55] literally while we were we were here I
[00:11:58] asked guys yo I asked guys yo if I yo if
[00:12:02] I listen if I joke about child again
[00:12:06] will child M be mad at me you guys said
[00:12:07] no it's fine they got mad at me dude
[00:12:10] these [ __ ] have no personality
[00:12:12] other than child that's like me with so
[00:12:14] I'm like insulting myself here dude I
[00:12:17] you guys told me it would be fine it
[00:12:19] wasn't fine they're like oh my God the
[00:12:21] same joke is getting it's not even funny
[00:12:23] stay away if child dies I'll kill
[00:12:27] you I hope sh dies me too me he's
[00:12:31] suffering his whole life I want him to
[00:12:33] die but in a good
[00:12:35] way God forbid a character as a
[00:12:37] Redemption
[00:12:41] Arc I used to I used to not even want
[00:12:44] child to die or want him to die in a way
[00:12:46] that's like a Redemption AR cuz he's
[00:12:47] literally a terrorist but maybe he's
[00:12:48] like an anti-hero morally gray I almost
[00:12:51] said yeah morally gray he comes back
[00:12:53] saves you cool now now now I want him to
[00:12:56] die for no reason I hope Nita turns
[00:12:59] through arara that doesn't even to make
[00:13:09] sense but it's genin so no character can
[00:13:14] die it can't like honai and stuff
[00:13:17] characters can die genin
[00:13:19] can't I'm not fully sure why maybe it's
[00:13:22] CU too many characters are getting like
[00:13:24] idolized
[00:13:26] now Senora Sora is not a playable
[00:13:28] character though it's not like actually
[00:13:29] like characters that aren't playable can
[00:13:31] die I hope playable characters can die
[00:13:34] too that'd be cool hopefully cuz it's
[00:13:36] better no it's weird I mean I think it's
[00:13:39] cuz too many 12-year-olds idolize their
[00:13:41] favorite character but I'm not
[00:13:46] sure cuz think about it think about it
[00:13:49] if you're playing dude think about it
[00:13:51] this means that either dor is not
[00:13:53] playable or can't die or becomes nice
[00:13:56] somehow all three of those are bad all
[00:13:58] three of those are bad either he like if
[00:14:00] he's not playable that sucks if he has a
[00:14:02] Redemption Arc that's weird and if he's
[00:14:04] uh uh uh what's the other one BR slide
[00:14:08] sliding between BR at
[00:14:10] Bret my
[00:14:15] brain what do you want child to die I
[00:14:17] don't but because I joked about it and
[00:14:19] people got mad now I
[00:14:21] do I think I think some characters
[00:14:23] should die though I like not everyone
[00:14:26] but some should it makes sense at some
[00:14:29] point probably should and I love Shia I
[00:14:31] hope he doesn't but it would make
[00:14:34] sense he [ __ ] suffering his whole
[00:14:36] life like he he literally is like wants
[00:14:39] to
[00:14:43] die TR C Quest no no it wouldn't have
[00:14:46] made sense obviously Jan Le would save
[00:14:47] him there it literally wouldn't make
[00:14:48] sense if he did but there could be a
[00:14:50] welld
[00:14:53] one is there a keyboard on the ground
[00:14:55] it's not on the ground it's on
[00:14:57] boxes
[00:15:04] anyways it was a joke I don't have a
[00:15:06] stance here I just I saw people be mad
[00:15:08] at the jok so I thought it was
[00:15:10] funny start determining which things you
[00:15:13] should spend your time wa I don't
[00:15:15] actually look at them though I don't
[00:15:17] look at the quotes I looked at replies
[00:15:18] someone I I clicked on someone's profile
[00:15:20] it was uh uh what was it it was child
[00:15:23] anties don't interact the [ __ ] is a
[00:15:25] child
[00:15:26] atie H how how delusional do you have to
[00:15:29] be to think people are anties of a genin
[00:15:32] charactera I mean maybe maybe there's
[00:15:33] some I'm a Dory
[00:15:37] antie I'm a Dory anti EU reviews on Ena
[00:15:41] uh I have a EU account it's level one
[00:15:42] it's AR like
[00:15:47] two all right anyways I'm just sing by
[00:15:49] the way I don't actually care about this
[00:15:51] at all this is irrelevant it was like
[00:15:53] two people I'm just stalling until zzz
[00:15:56] so hey guys how are you this is just me
[00:15:58] install it
[00:16:01] hey how are you
[00:16:05] guys don't forget what the Scara anties
[00:16:08] have done okay stop calling them anties
[00:16:10] though there's like Psychopaths that
[00:16:12] hate a character and that do weird [ __ ]
[00:16:14] in real life that's different than being
[00:16:16] like ha I hope Scara dies it it's not
[00:16:20] stop you equate them on the same level
[00:16:22] it's so
[00:16:23] weird it's so
[00:16:27] weird
[00:16:34] anyways we're waiting third hoo gacha
[00:16:37] aware no surely it's what if it's not
[00:16:39] gacha we actually don't know cuz I

[00:41:49] where people were asking for the longest
[00:41:51] time myself included for more weapon
[00:41:53] types and I still think we need like
[00:41:54] scythes but I know a scythe could be a
[00:41:55] PO arm but anyways and instead of doing
[00:41:57] that what they do is they give Catalyst
[00:41:59] characters different weapons they're
[00:42:01] just like [ __ ] it hazo punches rizzly
[00:42:03] punches [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] nette
[00:42:07] summons a hydroc coock Charlotte [ __ ]

[00:53:14] chatting stream okay I've said this
[00:53:16] since version 1.0 genin is literally
[00:53:19] just chatting with a background that's
[00:53:20] all it is you can't stream genin unless
[00:53:22] you're a just chatting streamer that's
[00:53:24] all it is music Low I can turn up a
[00:53:28] bit oh now it's
[00:53:33] loud wait no now it's still quietus 11
[00:53:36] call I never even get to watch you live
[00:53:38] do the puzzles
[00:53:47] regular Jong most definitely did not
[00:53:50] cook on that
[00:53:54] album
[00:53:56] wait did he though I don't know I didn't
[00:53:57] listen to
[00:54:05] it he
[00:54:11] did Z why is baiju in your team that's
[00:54:15] interesting why are you playing a baiju
[00:54:16] aggravate team that's interesting why
[00:54:19] why would you start stream Buu in your
[00:54:21] team H that's weird Z that's bizarre
[00:54:32] I'm not a fan of his solo stuff but I'm
[00:54:33] glad y'all are having fun that's such a
[00:54:35] politician answer [ __ ] Double Down be
[00:54:37] like it [ __ ] s double down have an
[00:54:46] opinion you say that dude did by reun is
[00:54:49] is next
[00:54:54] patch the [ __ ] am I
[00:55:00] doing changling is inin xiangling is in
[00:55:04] Star rail xiangling is in z z z when I
[00:55:07] see a red chili pepper I see a
[00:55:09] hallucination of xiangling how come we
[00:55:12] have xiangling in every game yet we
[00:55:14] can't have twinks and twunks in z z
[00:55:21] z can your expert opinion is BU you good
[00:55:25] I literally just recorded talking about
[00:55:28] BYU but we can't talk about it until the
[00:55:30] rerun however yes he so he's mostly a
[00:55:34] side grade to yao yao but if what we saw
[00:55:37] in the trailer is true and finina will
[00:55:40] drain some of your HP then having a
[00:55:42] Healer who can heal your whole team on a
[00:55:43] skill would get a lot
[00:55:47] stronger so yes
[00:55:54] xiangling
[00:55:57] finina heals no yes but okay what we saw
[00:56:00] is she could either summon a bunch of
[00:56:01] minions or a Healer unless the healing
[00:56:04] is like stupid broken it would seem dumb
[00:56:07] in my opinion to put a Healer down
[00:56:10] instead of three dudes that attack and
[00:56:11] apply Hydro I don't know maybe you user
[00:56:14] like kokomi too but if like what my
[00:56:17] guess is educated guess is that you use
[00:56:19] her skill for damage and applying Hydro
[00:56:21] why the [ __ ] would you use her as just a
[00:56:22] Healer ooh healer forena ooh
[00:56:25] like you probably use her with another
[00:56:27] healer probably and then you drain HP
[00:56:28] and stuff never but it's very useful
[00:56:31] yeah for like Overworld or
[00:56:33] whatever stop the porn
[00:56:38] acting you lose particle Jen how would
[00:56:41] you know
[00:56:43] that I'm saying what we know from the
[00:56:47] trailer any furina team
[00:56:53] yeah why would an Aron do damage bro bro

[00:59:33] idea it's it's not NE like there's other
[00:59:35] YULA teams but I I like Ry and YULA you
[00:59:37] could do like Ry and YULA even Lisa is
[00:59:39] not bad in that team as like a low
[00:59:40] investment option I kind of like
[00:59:50] it however there's a chance you end up
[00:59:53] benching Ula and then your ryen uh goes

[01:09:03] I could just have the box in my
[01:09:04] inventory why can't we
[01:09:07] I I think Ballad of the Fjord is cool
[01:09:11] it's a [ __ ] Trident it looks like
[01:09:13] Poseidon it's [ __ ] changling oh it's
[01:09:16] all coming out
[01:09:18] now Shang Ling could use it Talking
[01:09:21] Stick is funny but it's incredibly bad W
[01:09:24] Fang I already
[01:09:25] have Scion of the Blazing Sun more like
[01:09:28] Scion of the Blazing why the [ __ ] would
[01:09:30] I want this uh and then sacrificial yade
[01:09:33] is pretty good uh I'm pretty sure the
[01:09:36] weapons that I have a lot of are I have
[01:09:39] a lot of weap uh
[01:09:47] swords and I have a lot of pole
[01:09:52] arms
[01:09:56] there's pretty much no reason to get
[01:09:58] Jade because I already have to for net
[01:10:02] Pepe W I
[01:10:04] know talking sick is [ __ ]
[01:10:08] funny you have like 70 kagura yeah I
[01:10:11] know
[01:10:14] aware what if I get solar
[01:10:17] Pearl no I
[01:10:22] I
[01:10:25] just saying Talking Stick might be good
[01:10:27] sskk
[01:10:28] dude it's like so much work to get an
[01:10:31] effect that's like the same as just
[01:10:33] [ __ ] serpent spine like just serpent
[01:10:36] spine like maybe there might be a
[01:10:38] character that can use this better than
[01:10:39] serent maybe okay maybe other than like
[01:10:42] dea but like
[01:10:45] bro who
[01:10:47] cares ah could be a bad take maybe hey
[01:10:52] maybe
[01:10:56] because I could be wrong but draining HP
[01:10:59] doesn't count as taking damage right
[01:11:01] chat so it shouldn't [ __ ] serpent spine
[01:11:03] so even font 10 characters like I don't
[01:11:05] know maybe finina shouldn't [ __ ] your
[01:11:06] serpent spine right I obviously I didn't
[01:11:09] test it but like it shouldn't it
[01:11:12] shouldn't be because it's it's HP it's
[01:11:14] not damage so yeah I like this I think
[01:11:18] it looks really cool I don't know who
[01:11:20] would use it Hut I have H Shang Ling I
[01:11:23] have the cat
[01:11:34] talking you don't need any of them so
[01:11:36] get Talking Stick because it's funny I
[01:11:38] can't just ruin my account because it's
[01:11:40] funny who do you think I am do you think
[01:11:43] I'm the type of guy to buy five Royal
[01:11:45] grimoire for crit
[01:11:48] Comey yes I
[01:11:51] am I can also refine
[01:11:54] wolfang the new battes are mid that's
[01:11:57] not really true like this is a really
[01:11:58] good option for nevet Ballad is really
[01:12:00] good wolfang is really good this one is
[01:12:02] is whatever and then this one is mid I
[01:12:03] agree well this is arguably dog [ __ ] but
[01:12:06] maybe in the future it'll be
[01:12:11] good I supp to do the curse account
[01:12:13] review I'm so sorry for everyone who
[01:12:14] applied and I didn't respond to was
[01:12:17] AAR pyro aren will be like if D was a

[01:42:47] half the first 50 accounts or more than
[01:42:49] 50 I don't know before fin com comes out
[01:42:51] and then the other 50 will be after
[01:42:53] comes out uh because I'm impatient I
[01:42:55] want to record this
[01:42:56] now first half is going to be na
[01:42:58] accounts cuz we don't win in anything so
[01:43:01] you might as well win in the Z stream
[01:43:03] and then second half will be Asia
[01:43:05] accounts and for the EU
[01:43:08] viewers no sorry sorry that was toxic
[01:43:12] you guys are cool uh but we did EU
[01:43:14] reviews I think last time maybe we'll do
[01:43:16] them again later but for now
[01:43:19] yeah
[01:43:21] also I'll probably do um in the second
[01:43:25] stream I'll probably have a bit where I
[01:43:27] review my mods and my helpers accounts
[01:43:31] just to see if they're qualified or not
[01:43:33] cuz if they're listen listen if you're a
[01:43:36] Helper and your [ __ ] rizzly has six
[01:43:38] crit
[01:43:40] rate you might want to say goodbye to
[01:43:42] that
[01:43:44] role you're going to be fighting for
[01:43:46] your life whatever badge you have in my
[01:43:47] chat if I'm not happy with your account
[01:43:49] you lose it and you lose your right to
[01:43:51] speak not just not just in this chat but
[01:43:54] in real life
[01:43:56] true
[01:43:58] true so watch
[01:44:04] yourself watch yourself all right
[01:44:07] anyways so that's what's happening uh in
[01:44:09] order to be eligible to uid review what
[01:44:11] should you do okay listen last time we
[01:44:14] had a thing where we just did whatever
[01:44:15] is in the chat and then you could pay a
[01:44:17] th000 bit to skip the line I don't want
[01:44:19] to do any line skipping this time
[01:44:21] because you know I don't I want to be
[01:44:23] fair to
[01:44:26] everyone unless it's like 3K bits if
[01:44:29] it's like 3K that's like 30 I'm not
[01:44:31] going to hey I'm just saying sorry sorry
[01:44:33] but what we're going to do is we're do
[01:44:35] na accounts um so if you're na for today
[01:44:38] next stream will be Asia if you're
[01:44:40] na um you can type your uid and then one
[01:44:44] character and maybe a short description
[01:44:46] but only one I'm not going to check
[01:44:47] multiple characters for a uid maybe but
[01:44:50] for for the most part one character you
[01:44:51] could be like oh best chow or like
[01:44:54] whatever whatever the [ __ ] like rank
[01:44:55] five yoia dog [ __ ] yoia uh [ __ ] Noel
[01:44:58] whatever you want the character you want
[01:44:59] me to review and the uid 10K bits for
[01:45:02] other servers sure I'll [ __ ] hop
[01:45:04] servers for 10K that's like a 100 bucks
[01:45:06] I I'm not a [ __ ] I'm not going to Ego
[01:45:09] $100 that's like that's a
[01:45:12] lot that's like 50 Tim Horton
[01:45:15] coffees probably more actually it could
[01:45:17] be a dollar it depends where you get it
[01:45:19] or depends what you get I
[01:45:21] guess anyways so that's the plan we
[01:45:24] might put chat on like slow mode or
[01:45:26] something so that people don't spam too
[01:45:27] much cuz I don't want chat to be like
[01:45:29] disgusting and ugly but uh yeah probably
[01:45:33] don't spam your IDs while I'm reviewing
[01:45:34] someone and then in between you can type
[01:45:36] yours I'm going to try to do 50 today 50
[01:45:38] next stream editor you're going to have
[01:45:40] to cut like half of this Intro by the
[01:45:42] way cuz I'm yapping but like the first
[01:45:43] part okay
[01:45:46] cool wait one
[01:45:49] sec
[01:45:51] wait what is this U ID wait one sec

[01:46:18] first account
[01:46:23] I have to be careful of who I take
[01:46:25] because if that someone wrote thickest
[01:46:27] Jang Lee if I cop if I look at that one
[01:46:29] then everyone else is going to type
[01:46:30] stuff like that and I can't condone that
[01:46:32] so we'll take a sane one best alyam puts

[01:46:51] I have never seen an iron Sting with
[01:46:53] 10.5 damage bonus I didn't even know it
[01:46:55] could give
[01:46:58] 10.5 good option
[01:47:01] though two piece two piece is fine I
[01:47:05] thought this was going to be like best
[01:47:06] in slot but that's fine Crown his skill
[01:47:08] let's look at the pieces that's okay
[01:47:12] that's really
[01:47:14] good it's a lot of
[01:47:17] er okay be for right now
[01:47:21] listen I'm not doing this for this isn't
[01:47:24] listen here bud listen let me actually
[01:47:26] clarify let me clarify something for for
[01:47:28] everyone watching okay this is we have
[01:47:30] high standards here okay we're looking
[01:47:31] for the best builds I'm reviewing
[01:47:33] hundreds of accounts okay I'm not here
[01:47:35] to play Oh attack percent and EM you
[01:47:38] know pretty good on high he can use both
[01:47:39] three crit rate it's on set listen we're
[01:47:42] not in copton City right now okay yes
[01:47:44] there's good substats that aren't crit
[01:47:46] but we're looking for the best
[01:47:48] builds if your circlet is is good I will
[01:47:51] apologize to you if it's
[01:47:53] mid I'm going to say a bad
[01:47:56] word I'm going to say a bad word freck
[01:48:00] this is actually not bad em attack crit
[01:48:01] damage is
[01:48:03] fine you have 100 you have 100 you
[01:48:07] barely have three digits of crit
[01:48:12] damage I'm supposed to be reviewing the
[01:48:15] best builds what is
[01:48:17] this sorry I closed my alerts uh
[01:48:21] I said we're not going to take any line
[01:48:22] Skippers unless someone donates
[01:48:24] something dumb like 3K bits and someone
[01:48:26] donated 3K bits
[01:48:28] so rip boo capitalism
[01:48:31] moment what is this number three kaching
[01:48:34] on aasha wait
[01:48:36] really is there even a leaderboard for
[01:48:38] kaching I'm pretty sure people just dude
[01:48:40] I saw fob literally filter by crit Dam
[01:48:43] like crit volume be like I'm number one
[01:48:45] kaching and like it's not even a
[01:48:46] leaderboard it's just crit
[01:48:49] value
[01:48:51] all right anyways uh number three
[01:48:52] kaching let's look at it 1,00 attack 51
[01:48:56] em that's very low for like aggravated
[01:48:58] stuff just so you know but hey we'll
[01:49:00] look at sub stats maybe it'll be cracked
[01:49:01] Miss flitter that's good high base
[01:49:04] attack weapon a lot of stats fourth
[01:49:06] running Fury Triple Crown I like to see
[01:49:08] it uh maybe you're probably on an attack
[01:49:11] sand which is still viable even if
[01:49:12] aggravates so let's
[01:49:18] look that is insane that is actually
[01:49:21] very insane let's look at the feather
[01:49:23] that is also really good that is
[01:49:26] D
[01:49:28] what that's
[01:49:30] 20 that's crit rate chat that is not
[01:49:33] crit damage that is 20 crit
[01:49:35] rate what is this
[01:49:38] kaching also you put kaching and G
[01:49:41] together this is like you are this
[01:49:43] person you have a shrine of kaching in
[01:49:45] your room no disrespect I just know you
[01:49:48] do let me look at the let me look at the
[01:49:49] goblet
[01:49:51] that was pretty good
[01:49:53] um it's like arguably your worst piece
[01:49:55] so far but it's still pretty good like
[01:49:57] still really good it would be amazing on
[01:49:58] Ryden cuz onet but or B but good uh
[01:50:03] CET oh dude what the
[01:50:07] [ __ ] yeah this is crack this is a good
[01:50:09] kaching this is a good kaching wait
[01:50:11] actually um
[01:50:14] actually Z moment I'm sorry I have to do
[01:50:16] this too this is insane but kaching
[01:50:20] burst gives you 15% crit rate when you
[01:50:22] use it which means you are actually
[01:50:23] overcapped on crit rate uh it's still
[01:50:26] good you still have a lot of crit value
[01:50:28] but crit damage would be better than
[01:50:30] crit rate for you right now you could
[01:50:31] lower your crit rate a little just so
[01:50:33] you
[01:50:34] know uh also em is good for AG but still
[01:50:37] really good still really good let me
[01:50:40] look at your Gan CU might as
[01:50:42] well I hate you why am I getting mad at
[01:50:46] you for having a good build I don't know
[01:50:48] but this is sincerely upsetting me
[01:50:50] although your melt gone you has no em
[01:50:52] why do you have no em I mean 120 is like
[01:50:54] 120 is fine but you want you Pro you
[01:50:57] want an em
[01:50:59] SS but I mean these are really good sub
[01:51:01] SS so is what it is that that King was
[01:51:03] cracked I can't lie I almost said
[01:51:06] Jeepers but I'm going to I'm good start
[01:51:08] to the day good start to the day I'm
[01:51:10] happy best freeto play Aqua yolan why
[01:51:14] would you I don't trust that this is
[01:51:15] free to play do free to play players
[01:51:17] pull for aqua maybe maybe uh let's look
[01:51:20] at it 34k HP Aqua simulakra four emblem
[01:51:24] of SE fate with a Blood Stained goblet
[01:51:27] this should better be insane if it's
[01:51:28] Blood Stained yep that oh my God that's
[01:51:31] actually really good that is actually
[01:51:33] really good that is actually insane cuz
[01:51:35] you need a lot of ER on your lawn
[01:51:36] especially in like non double Hydro if
[01:51:39] you don't have like an ER weapon that's
[01:51:40] actually really really good uh also
[01:51:42] really good I mean that's pretty good
[01:51:43] yeah what about
[01:51:45] this this looks like a lot of low rolls
[01:51:48] I can't lie but it's still good good
[01:51:49] stat
[01:51:50] feather that's insane last piece don't
[01:51:53] disappoint me
[01:51:56] now how was your flower your worst
[01:51:59] piece pretty good though pretty good uh
[01:52:03] could have more ER in a lot of teams but
[01:52:05] in some teams this is more than enough
[01:52:07] so I'm not going to judge you cuz I
[01:52:08] don't [ __ ]
[01:52:10] know not bad let me look at you ride it
[01:52:14] oh my God it's an em
[01:52:16] ridden well we found Z Jeff
[01:52:21] whoa someone just chucked 30 USD out the
[01:52:24] window best
[01:52:27] show this is a $30 show right here this
[01:52:30] is literally a minus
[01:52:32] 30 minus 30 kekw staf of we like to see
[01:52:35] it Triple Crown we love to see it C1 we
[01:52:39] hey so far you're a man of my
[01:52:44] heart let me look two Vermilion two
[01:52:46] vescent this means you touch the
[01:52:47] Vermillion domain I'm sorry maybe you
[01:52:50] strongbox it actually uh which is
[01:52:52] actually a smart thing to do so let's
[01:52:58] look when is my turn hoyo hoyo verse if
[01:53:02] you can if you can hear me when is it my
[01:53:06] turn this is really good okay okay
[01:53:15] feather [ __ ] on a brick and call me
[01:53:17] Sally I'm impressed s pretty good I mean
[01:53:21] yeah that's really good
[01:53:23] actually H attack goet attack is fine
[01:53:26] two ideally you so if you're doing
[01:53:29] Vermillion you're probably trying to get
[01:53:30] four piece on four piece Vermillion
[01:53:31] attack becomes worse than an Nemo
[01:53:33] because you have a lot of attack from
[01:53:34] the set for just the twopiece two piece
[01:53:37] it's fine to go attack goblet but not
[01:53:40] the best piece ciret that's insane wait
[01:53:42] this actually really good yeah good
[01:53:43] trial I approve seal of approval anemo
[01:53:47] go would be better but it's all good let
[01:53:48] me look at your net okay okay let me not
[01:53:50] look at you another that next
[01:53:55] one fine hopeful I'll do yours number 39

[01:54:13] might be CZ cut I recommend a shield are
[01:54:14] you no you're not skill issue skill
[01:54:17] issue I fear I'm sorry it's fine play
[01:54:18] how you want to play uh let's look at
[01:54:20] your net uh 4 40K HP that's really good
[01:54:23] sack Jade very good uh for Mar chose let
[01:54:25] me look at your talents not ground fake
[01:54:27] fan all good let's look at
[01:54:31] these I that's
[01:54:34] okay that's actually pretty cracked it
[01:54:36] it looks the same right it looks similar
[01:54:38] but you also have the 10% HP there oh
[01:54:40] here there's four I didn't even see it
[01:54:42] these P are pretty good they're pretty
[01:54:43] good they're pretty good uh not
[01:54:48] bad it's
[01:54:54] okay 80% HP is really
[01:54:57] good it okay it's like good but it looks
[01:55:00] mid but it is good does that make sense
[01:55:02] maybe it's cuz I'm a crit value Andy but
[01:55:04] like 18% HP is really good the ER and
[01:55:06] the HP is really good like all these
[01:55:07] pieces are good it just like doesn't
[01:55:09] look good but it is
[01:55:11] good yeah you also true you also
[01:55:13] probably don't need more crit rate cuz
[01:55:14] you have 36 plus 30 uh uh six and then
[01:55:19] yeah what the [ __ ] you have so much CR
[01:55:21] rate but yeah no this is pretty

[02:02:25] desert
[02:02:26] Pavilion you farmed desert
[02:02:30] Pavilion as someone who has spent

[02:02:38] that's good it's really
[02:02:43] good are you respectfully are you trying
[02:02:45] to build huta
[02:02:47] yolon is this a finina piece why do you
[02:02:51] have 16%
[02:02:53] HP I'll let it slide let's look at the
[02:02:55] Sands that's really good okay goblet
[02:02:59] that's fine ciret this better be
[02:03:05] good you know what happy birthday I'll
[02:03:07] leave it at that you probably want more
[02:03:08] crit rate though uh your ratio is a
[02:03:10] little skewed you probably want more
[02:03:11] crit rate
[02:03:14] but it's
[02:03:17] okay
[02:03:28] wait I scammed like two people one sec I
[02:03:30] didn't notice I'll do a random I'll do
[02:03:32] someone from chat first and then I'll do
[02:03:33] the people I scammed by accident top 1%
[02:03:35] free to play neverl Let's Do
[02:03:39] It Tony oh my goodness oh my God why do
[02:03:42] you sound like M oh my goodness oh my
[02:03:45] gosh Grandmaster Grandmaster Jean sorry
[02:03:51] that protype Amber
[02:03:55] R1 bro refine what AR are you your
[02:04:00] ar57 refine your prototype Amber why is
[02:04:04] it
[02:04:08] R1 okay in my nevet guide I said listen
[02:04:12] prot
[02:04:15] Amber I stopped responding say when okay
[02:04:19] with with nevet and rizzly both of their
[02:04:21] weapons are good and they cost billets
[02:04:23] right they're free play weapons but they
[02:04:24] cost billets you can always use the
[02:04:27] ballad of the boundless blue if you
[02:04:30] don't if you can't really like refine
[02:04:32] your other
[02:04:33] weapons so you could use that if you
[02:04:35] want the refinement sucks not for nevet
[02:04:37] cuz you get more energy which is
[02:04:38] important and healing for your team and
[02:04:40] you don't need a Healer in a nevet team
[02:04:42] a lot of the times so it's actually
[02:04:44] quite useful but you don't need it fair
[02:04:46] enough fair enough I'll be I'll be
[02:04:48] normal

[02:06:42] all R4 Jade wait really oh my God that's
[02:06:46] an R4 Jade spear with an HP goblet ain't
[02:06:51] no way okay understand something main
[02:06:54] stats like 99% of the time main stats
[02:06:57] are the most important thing and more
[02:06:58] important than well okay sub stats
[02:07:00] matter but main stats are more important
[02:07:02] than like your set bonus okay now
[02:07:04] there's instances where sub stats are
[02:07:06] important like like example attack
[02:07:08] versus anemo goblet sure but if it's
[02:07:10] like a useless ass main stat don't use
[02:07:12] it even if you get the set effect from
[02:07:13] it unless it's a support like deepwood
[02:07:16] memory like you know the deepwood set or

[02:34:07] mean this
[02:34:09] is okay flat HP on a character that has
[02:34:12] a big amount of HP is not nearly as good
[02:34:15] as percent this is okay this flower is
[02:34:18] insane by the
[02:34:20] way uh I respect it but I would just go
[02:34:23] deepwood or instructor if you're playing
[02:34:25] Quicken but I mean I respect it the subs
[02:34:27] are good so yeah I mean it's not

[02:34:41] that a new character oh my God she's red
[02:34:44] oh my God is this the first ever
[02:34:46] six-star character in eng an impact okay
[02:34:49] by the way the fact that your aloy is
[02:34:50] level 90 and your Abyss 103 is very
[02:34:51] telling however let's look aloy oh my
[02:34:54] God Aqua simulakra
[02:34:57] two blizzard trayer oh maybe aloy can't
[02:35:00] use can only have one two piece that

[02:35:13] look okay that's good that's randomly
[02:35:17] really good that's insane that's why is
[02:35:21] that an
[02:35:25] em wait why are these pieces so good why
[02:35:28] this aloy is like stupidly cracked and
[02:35:30] they have an em goblet for no reason but
[02:35:32] other than that it's really good what
[02:35:34] the hell why you have an em
[02:35:39] goblet yeah you probably just Yin pieces
[02:35:41] from other characters
[02:35:44] actually
[02:35:51] a Shang Ling only Z Jeff could love what
[02:35:53] the [ __ ] does that even mean what the
[02:35:56] [ __ ] does that even mean the catch four
[02:36:01] emblem wait these are actually really
[02:36:03] efficient sub stats oh maybe that's why
[02:36:05] wait actually like look all these Subs
[02:36:07] are good all these Subs are good all
[02:36:09] these Subs are good all these Subs are
[02:36:11] good although a lot of attack but yeah

[02:36:19] need 230 ER probably not maybe I don't
[02:36:22] know what you're playing but probably
[02:36:23] not maybe you're playing her with like

[03:14:49] reviews soon though I actually want to
[03:14:52] do
[03:15:04] it is golden troop viable on Jong
[03:15:10] Lee for sure [ __ ] it be
[03:15:17] Sanctified that
[03:15:23] actually
[03:15:26] move
[03:15:41] cool
[03:15:56] domain
[03:16:00] B use po reminisence for who tow that
[03:16:02] hell yeah you
[03:16:05] can if you have a good subat which you
[03:16:07] probably do cuz you farmed emblem like a
[03:16:09] good boy uh then you can do
[03:16:12] tell it's actually not it's not far
[03:16:17] behind it's just more annoying to
[03:16:21] use
[03:16:31] silence
[03:16:41] boom
[03:16:42] you do star U reviews uh
[03:16:46] maybe maybe not against
[03:16:50] it did I do daily commissions yet no way
[03:16:53] I'm [ __ ] three hours in the Stream I
[03:16:54] didn't do daily
[03:16:58] commissions okay I didn't do I have
[03:17:01] Cliffhanger no I don't un lucky one day
[03:17:04] I'll got
[03:17:11] cliffhanger
[03:17:15] what's your next stream I don't know I
[03:17:17] want to do the archon quest stream
[03:17:18] before finina is out but I also have to
[03:17:20] record two finina videos one baiju video
[03:17:24] and one Charlotte video so I'm actually
[03:17:26] like Omega booked and I have family over
[03:17:28] so what I think I'm going to do is uh
[03:17:31] probably this three days still frea
[03:17:34] three and a
[03:17:35] half I'll probably do one more stream
[03:17:37] before Fin's out and then finina stream
[03:17:41] probably
[03:17:53] BYU a finina meta wise BYU if you have
[03:17:56] finina gets a lot better probably we
[03:17:57] don't know from what we saw in the live
[03:17:59] stream is my guess however how no leaks
[03:18:02] however uh finina seems we don't know
[03:18:06] her damage her numbers her Hydro but
[03:18:09] like I actually don't know like I'm not
[03:18:10] like now I'm not joking I actually don't
[03:18:11] know
[03:18:12] but she looks very
[03:18:19] promising no uning in
[03:18:24] chat remember comes
[03:18:27] first an oversight on my part an
[03:18:31] oversight an
[03:18:34] oversight
[03:18:41] down
[03:18:43] I mean the first Hydro archon is already
[03:18:45] pretty good uh I use Ki in a lot of
[03:18:47] teams so I assume the second one will be
[03:18:49] good
[03:19:01] too also if finina and charlot are on
[03:19:05] the same half of the banner I should
[03:19:07] probably prearm like smart things to
[03:19:09] prearm and stop doing artifacts cuz I
[03:19:11] only have 3 million Mora and probably no
[03:19:14] XP books so
[03:19:19] yeah like I should probably get like
[03:19:21] stuff to level people side effects
[03:19:23] taking a turn for the let's
[03:19:26] begin stay face
[03:19:33] your the TI's
