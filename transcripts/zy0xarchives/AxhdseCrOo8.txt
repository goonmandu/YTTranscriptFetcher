[00:23:57] I don't even know that like hit the
[00:23:58] heavy hit taken or whatever because I
[00:24:00] don't think damage don't try either
[00:24:01] that's actually crazy real xiaomanes
[00:24:03] don't take damage on him they just
[00:24:04] shield and heal him up
[00:24:06] so yeah he'll ever heard this in three
[00:24:08] months pie Bagel leaves the three months
[00:24:20] I saw you guys see one day is she good
[00:24:22] now BTW I am the number one child main
[00:24:24] uh yeah I did I did actually activate
[00:24:27] you one day just to like help her as a
[00:24:29] character usually I wouldn't activate it
[00:24:30] but I felt like she needed
[00:24:34] whatever we're not using data today
[00:24:36] actually we are with ciao but I'll give
[00:24:37] her five
[00:24:39] it would activate it
[00:24:42] uh okay let me do my dailies I uncap my
[00:24:45] resume by the way let me do my dailies
[00:24:46] and I'll do Abyss
[00:24:48] we have a few teams to try and a few
[00:24:50] showcases to showcase
[00:24:54] do you think Dale's gonna be good in
[00:24:56] Fontaine yeah she's gonna get buffed
[00:24:57] she's gonna get um so yeah she's gonna
[00:25:00] get uh her skills gonna be the cool none
[00:25:03] of her skills can be reduced in half no
[00:25:04] sorry the up time is doubled and her
[00:25:07] burst will now have a 10 second cooldown
[00:25:09] only and it doesn't cancel when you jump
[00:25:11] and it lasts four seconds longer uh if
[00:25:14] you have her first constellation and
[00:25:16] also the Pyro application of her skill
[00:25:19] is uh now there's no ICD on it and every
[00:25:22] single time you hit it'll uh do a wave
[00:25:24] of pyro through the whole field and
[00:25:26] burgeon any core so uh she's gonna be a
[00:25:28] virgin carry even from all field and
[00:25:30] also
[00:25:32] um her passive that reduces damage now
[00:25:34] will also give you a small pyro Shield
[00:25:36] when it expires so that your
[00:25:38] Interruption resistance has more up time
[00:25:45] just pull you lose
[00:25:49] dude I'm streaming early because I said
[00:25:51] I would I said new Abyss I'll stream
[00:25:53] early I'm not a liar
[00:25:58] uh fruit coat thinks fruit soda there's
[00:26:00] a tier one vodka call takes at eight
[00:26:03] months
[00:26:04] following me
[00:26:06] oh [ __ ]
[00:26:08] is it good to use the Luke in this Abyss
[00:26:10] last Abyss he was actually not bad
[00:26:11] second half this one I don't know I
[00:26:12] didn't spoil it I have no [ __ ] clue
[00:26:14] what the enemies are
[00:26:18] bro you know I've never seen this [ __ ]
[00:26:20] around my alarm
[00:26:22] I didn't even notice the visual
[00:26:25] though
[00:26:30] stacked it up
[00:26:36] we could play we could the retroversion
[00:26:41] Freedom sworn has that too yeah I feel
[00:26:43] like I've noticed other weapons but I
[00:26:45] haven't really noticed elegy so I feel
[00:26:46] like usually elegy I just swap out
[00:26:49] [Music]
[00:26:51] that's a fellow Canadian I'm shocked
[00:26:53] you're awake at the same time as me for
[00:26:55] once what is that supposed to mean
[00:26:59] foreign
[00:27:01] why is this guy's name Biden Shogun
[00:27:09] that's actually a pretty good name
[00:27:17] I like to do three hits on Cara then
[00:27:19] Dash hoping my passive Prague after the
[00:27:22] third hit and if it doesn't then I just
[00:27:23] I blame the game
[00:27:29] I think that's the optimal Scara combo
[00:27:31] if you assume you get a dash in three
[00:27:33] hits and if you don't it's the game
[00:27:34] solved
[00:27:37] foreign
[00:27:46] with a pretty good flower a pretty good
[00:27:49] feather okay Sans a pretty good goblet
[00:27:52] and a pretty good amazing dare I say
[00:27:54] amazing circling uh and he has a 90
[00:27:58] 206.9 ratio [ __ ] energy recharge with a
[00:28:02] decent attack decent attack it's not bad
[00:28:04] attack especially with like a you know
[00:28:05] low-ish base stack pretty good
[00:28:08] hey Mata
[00:28:15] foreign
[00:28:19] is basically a five star if you don't
[00:28:21] like [ __ ] up your rotation granted the
[00:28:23] EM1 is useless on him but you can just
[00:28:25] reset is what it is
[00:28:28] I just like what's it makes me feel
[00:28:29] massive
[00:28:32] also our five stars used on other
[00:28:33] characters yaimiko has her yaimiko and
[00:28:36] Atlas is on
[00:28:38] okay at least maybe I'm no one actually
[00:28:40] who the [ __ ] is Alice on Hazel yeah
[00:28:42] there you go
[00:28:43] okay granted I have others but I'm not
[00:28:44] gonna level more than one uh these are
[00:28:46] just they're aesthetic I guess I don't
[00:28:49] know I have Royal grimoire that's a five
[00:28:50] star can't imagine him
[00:29:05] wait what the [ __ ] is our commission
[00:29:07] where is it
[00:29:10] am I blind bro
[00:29:14] wait where the [ __ ] is the commission
[00:29:20] you know what let's just navigate let's
[00:29:21] just navigate we'll just navigate
[00:29:24] oh I have to wait till then
[00:29:29] wow I love waiting till the next evening
[00:29:34] wow this is very enticing content
[00:29:42] good night you look cute
[00:29:48] [Music]
[00:29:52] go to the cafe and talk to Mata
[00:29:57] can you share your playlist let's just
[00:29:58] start starting wait actually it's just
[00:29:59] our Hearthstone
[00:30:00] let's make sure I play this as other
[00:30:02] ones Mr bird
[00:30:06] hello why do you never activate
[00:30:07] constellations on characters you're not
[00:30:09] even relatable okay look showcase today
[00:30:11] it's kind of scuffed because like it
[00:30:14] depends from character to character but
[00:30:15] I don't like until we I hope we get talk
[00:30:18] level constellations because like it's
[00:30:19] just weird like
[00:30:22] how do I say this nicely okay
[00:30:24] here's an example okay I low-key regret
[00:30:27] C2 Ryden okay here's why let's say let's
[00:30:29] say I have just a good build right let's
[00:30:30] have a good build and like I clear
[00:30:31] everything fast people like people's
[00:30:33] takeaway would be like oh wow writing's
[00:30:35] pretty good
[00:30:36] but if I have if I have now that's c0 if
[00:30:39] I have C2 and I do the exact same thing
[00:30:41] but with a bit more damage like sure
[00:30:43] it's more damage but like a lot of times
[00:30:45] who the [ __ ] cares because you're
[00:30:46] playing right in with like a bunch of
[00:30:47] other carries then people be like oh
[00:30:49] it's only good because of C2 so like I
[00:30:51] kind of don't like activating cons
[00:30:57] but yeah
[00:31:01] you have R1 weapons yeah but like
[00:31:04] that's also why I don't R5 weapons dude
[00:31:06] look at my jade spear look it's R1 but I
[00:31:09] have one two three I have enough to R5
[00:31:11] it but like then it just makes it even
[00:31:12] more unrelatable
[00:31:14] because like with Xiao it's like his
[00:31:16] constellations don't do anything unless
[00:31:18] you choose to dash after your punches
[00:31:20] it's like the difference between a C1
[00:31:21] shot and a C6 trial is literally nothing
[00:31:23] unless you spam your ease
[00:31:25] like it's two C5 is like a two percent
[00:31:27] damage increase wow two percent one sub
[00:31:31] Style
[00:31:44] quit following me
[00:31:48] you have insane artifacts you're
[00:31:50] unrelatable okay do you wanna do you
[00:31:51] want to see how dumb you're about to
[00:31:52] look look at this look at this
[00:31:56] okay you want to see how dumb you're
[00:31:57] about to look watch this watch us
[00:32:00] okay this is my current child okay
[00:32:02] current shot right now
[00:32:04] 87 212 okay let's look at what my shower
[00:32:09] was like
[00:32:11] two and a half years ago
[00:32:16] oh basically the same
[00:32:20] so in that time you could have caught up
[00:32:24] it's literally the same
[00:32:27] Vermilion is just wasted my life
[00:32:30] it's the same it's literally the same
[00:32:34] and this was two years ago
[00:32:37] so like yeah obviously my artifacts are
[00:32:39] good
[00:32:40] but like you know does it is between
[00:32:42] good artifacts and c6r5
[00:32:45] which is why I try to like but like even
[00:32:46] if I was c6r5 everything it doesn't
[00:32:48] really matter as long as I don't pretend
[00:32:50] that it's not a c6r5
[00:32:53] oh yeah collusionics it's worse because
[00:32:56] now it's okay this isn't my I have 138
[00:32:59] PM okay this build is in my optimal
[00:33:01] child build okay it's just it is what it
[00:33:03] is and our Vermillion sucks balls are
[00:33:05] two piece two pieces better okay our
[00:33:07] 2v2b's is better but vert million it
[00:33:09] gives you like almost 10 more damage so
[00:33:12] it makes up for it but our two vcv stats
[00:33:14] are unironically better like I'm not
[00:33:16] even kidding
[00:33:18] add
[00:33:45] no leaks I'm trying dude you don't know
[00:33:48] how hard it is I'm like forcing myself
[00:33:50] not to look at leaks stop it I do not
[00:33:53] want to be spoiled because then whenever
[00:33:55] anything new does actually come then I
[00:33:58] can't actually have an authentic
[00:33:59] reaction to it so I'm trying not to look
[00:34:01] at anything
[00:34:02] like unironically
[00:34:13] Bulls donated one dollar balls
[00:34:18] these are dollar balls
[00:34:20] well I'm gonna get all these dandelions
[00:34:21] for no reason other than I'm stalling
[00:34:25] oh also chat okay because we're gonna do
[00:34:27] Abyss today dude look
[00:34:29] foreign
[00:34:31] look I literally geared damn near every
[00:34:35] viable character look scarra geared
[00:34:38] casua 1000 em Freedom sworn geared yilon
[00:34:42] now granted by Ilana I have to share
[00:34:44] artifacts between a lot of characters so
[00:34:45] I put it on the HP circlet because I
[00:34:47] don't have enough crit circuits on
[00:34:48] emblem that's the only compromise I did
[00:34:50] but still enough ER over 30k HP without
[00:34:53] Hydro resonance and a pretty good ratio
[00:34:55] and elegy so still geared baiju bunch of
[00:34:58] HP geared ciao geared Sino guess what
[00:35:02] 100 crit rate if we don't crit ending
[00:35:04] stream geared yeah Miko oh guess what
[00:35:07] [ __ ] geared and 150 em uh er sorry
[00:35:10] Ryden we don't talk about her Kuching
[00:35:11] [ __ ] okay kinda scuffed because
[00:35:14] usually my kaching is on a light of
[00:35:16] foliar precision
[00:35:18] uh and like a bit more curry but
[00:35:22] cutter now and it's definitely too much
[00:35:25] but we'll figure it out uh someone said
[00:35:27] level 90 or baiju dude it's 89.
[00:35:31] it's fine
[00:35:34] um
[00:35:37] um I mean I could give her a little bit
[00:35:39] more damage I could do
[00:35:44] cool it
[00:35:49] okay we still overcap with burst
[00:35:52] hey Fang are you up
[00:35:56] um
[00:35:57] are you a beaver
[00:36:01] because damn
[00:36:06] anyways yeah so we have a bit too much
[00:36:08] crit rate but I kind of focused on my
[00:36:10] Sino more than my kitchen right now so
[00:36:12] that's why it's kind of hard to bat like
[00:36:14] Simon share a lot of it it is what it is
[00:36:16] okay it is what it is
[00:36:18] um wait why do I have the crittery one
[00:36:20] on him where's the crit damage one it's
[00:36:21] on Fishel
[00:36:23] oh but my official
[00:36:27] what about yaimiko surely yamiko can
[00:36:29] take a little bit more great because
[00:36:30] that's better what about yamiko no I
[00:36:33] mean that's one to two Okay good is that
[00:36:34] not enough VR though
[00:36:36] that'll be fine anyways I'll hide them
[00:36:38] pretty good pretty good uh pretty good
[00:36:42] you know boom boom boom boom nahida yup
[00:36:44] geared yup yup yup uh enough em and also
[00:36:47] critical yup nilu basically 60k HP when
[00:36:50] you get hydro resonance that's over 60
[00:36:52] HP uh uh oh wait I pause chat
[00:37:02] oh yeah so nilu good best assault weapon
[00:37:05] uh best of all time levels geared kokomi
[00:37:08] Our Queen kokomi Nation also geared On
[00:37:10] Em not that much VM but that's because
[00:37:11] she's on the wrong weapon let me change
[00:37:13] weapons uh
[00:37:16] I only have two
[00:37:18] we could give nahida
[00:37:21] oh that's kind of scoffed actually
[00:37:29] okay I'll give Nikita Atlas for now I'll
[00:37:30] change up oh no let's not get on us
[00:37:33] I want another one
[00:37:36] whatever I'll give her Alice from no I'm
[00:37:38] not I'll just
[00:37:40] okay we're not gonna play sucrose yet
[00:37:41] we'll play sucrose later when we play
[00:37:42] suit girls will swap and two girls can
[00:37:44] use throwing Tails actually even in a
[00:37:46] taser team or like even when she wants
[00:37:47] yams that's fine okay boom uh hutau Homa
[00:37:51] uh 110 em 83 240 suck my balls sucrose
[00:37:55] Ian Kaya new skin
[00:37:59] foreign
[00:38:03] but we don't have enough like it's
[00:38:05] really hard I have emblem on look at how
[00:38:08] many characters have emblem right now
[00:38:09] and I don't Farm emblem because I farm
[00:38:10] Vermillion surely surely if emblem comes
[00:38:13] to strongbox I use I do emblem and not
[00:38:15] Vermillion right anyways so I I like
[00:38:17] look one two three four five and then
[00:38:19] kind of six characters are using emblem
[00:38:21] so it's hard but with that said I have
[00:38:23] em Sans usually I go attack on Kyle but
[00:38:26] em can work in Reverse melt boom pretty
[00:38:27] good ratio enough you are wow uh and
[00:38:30] he's on a four star weapon because we're
[00:38:31] gonna be doing a four-star clear cookie
[00:38:32] shinobu boom ER official 2000 attack 91
[00:38:36] 189 Polar Star boom Beto four emblem
[00:38:40] serpent spine ratio okay okay what else
[00:38:46] like I want a bit of energy uh recharge
[00:38:52] okay wait
[00:38:54] shangling doesn't need it
[00:38:56] tell me why shangling is so op I can
[00:39:03] Vape
[00:39:04] we're not playing him but yeah he's
[00:39:06] still pretty decent uh uh who else well
[00:39:09] as well Kirara full HP geared Barbara
[00:39:12] Toma full HP 4p
[00:39:15] he's still geared to play with Xiao in a
[00:39:17] pyro resonance team gone de Luke wolves
[00:39:20] gravestone Forker is the witch
[00:39:23] it's okay probably a wrong circlet
[00:39:25] probably a wrong circlet
[00:39:29] but still pretty good shangling four
[00:39:32] Emblem The Catch yes sir yes sir and
[00:39:34] that might look like low crit rate but
[00:39:36] don't remember don't forget what the
[00:39:37] catch does
[00:39:39] yes sir
[00:39:41] we see uh takes a prime yes harp there's
[00:39:44] a prime
[00:39:45] Albedo I don't even [ __ ] use him and
[00:39:47] he's geared strongly geared
[00:39:50] venti geared Jade geared
[00:39:54] Eula geared
[00:39:57] ayaka gear Shadow gear tanari gear
[00:40:01] ayato
[00:40:02] not even on a crit weapon because I
[00:40:04] don't have any weapons and he still
[00:40:06] looks delectable but I don't even have
[00:40:08] okay I don't have enough swords I
[00:40:10] actually don't have enough swords
[00:40:11] because I legit like my black lives I
[00:40:13] can't even use on him because on Kaya
[00:40:15] amino's on her like I legit don't have a
[00:40:18] sword for him
[00:40:20] so I I don't have enough swords I might
[00:40:22] have to level black sword black sword is
[00:40:24] the one I should level I think give it
[00:40:25] to kaching or give it to ayato like
[00:40:27] something like that
[00:40:28] but I don't really have the mats well I
[00:40:31] kind of do but it's fine
[00:40:33] um I don't really want to pull a
[00:40:34] signature because why would I pull
[00:40:39] answer my question you short lanyard
[00:40:41] what is a lanyard
[00:40:44] what was your question
[00:40:47] how tall are you in centimeters my
[00:40:49] friend is asking
[00:40:51] first of all [ __ ] your friend second of
[00:40:53] all
[00:40:54] like 190 200
[00:40:56] no more what is a centimeter like uh 250
[00:40:59] I think
[00:41:08] 250. balls donated one dollar
[00:41:20] is ours I thought doesn't have a good
[00:41:21] sword it's not blade right now but it's
[00:41:23] fine they are yeah everyone's geared
[00:41:25] literally everyone's geared literally
[00:41:26] everyone's geared
[00:41:29] oh yeah my Rosaria Rosalina asked me
[00:41:32] about her two waters two blizzard now
[00:41:34] it's not the best set but I'm going on
[00:41:36] sub stats so 81.89 with enough ER and 80
[00:41:39] em and
[00:41:41] yeah
[00:41:46] singtroll now singtel was kind of the
[00:41:49] Wasteland of our emblem set because we
[00:41:50] don't have enough emblems but he still
[00:41:52] pulled through
[00:41:53] amazing we might have to alternate
[00:41:56] before we do our four star clear and
[00:41:57] [ __ ] like yolan to gear arsenjo but it's
[00:42:00] okay for now
[00:42:02] ask me about my yayao favonius Lance
[00:42:05] four piece instructor yes sir
[00:42:08] okay that's basically it we're not
[00:42:10] really using anyone else Mika
[00:42:20] why are you sniffing scarra
[00:42:27] he does not know you
[00:42:35] our scar is pretty good though
[00:42:37] um there's a few talents I've noticed
[00:42:38] that I want to level like a few of my
[00:42:40] characters I didn't really look back at
[00:42:41] their talents and I'm like why is this
[00:42:43] only level seven so we might actually
[00:42:44] spend our resin efficiently
[00:42:48] uh in the coming streams surely before

[00:45:23] uh I wanna level this too let's see if
[00:45:25] we have gold books
[00:45:29] dude I literally geared before I started
[00:45:31] streaming this is just pound stuff I
[00:45:32] literally geared off stream so it's not
[00:45:34] like I have to wait I don't even have a
[00:45:36] single gold book
[00:45:37] bro gold isn't here I'll hand your guard
[00:45:41] oh
[00:45:46] no no no no no no no
[00:45:48] okay it's fine okay let's go
[00:45:51] oh what's the new Ley line actually
[00:45:55] I have no spoilers but it's the best I'm
[00:45:56] sure it's not gonna be hard because it's
[00:45:58] you likely but I have no spoilers
[00:46:00] at all
[00:46:02] plunging
[00:46:03] plunging attacks GG Shadows Meadow
[00:46:05] within 10 seconds after the character
[00:46:07] enters the field the character's normal
[00:46:09] charger plunger attacks will deal 30
[00:46:10] increase damage the Olympus most
[00:46:12] certainly knew you if you just hear me
[00:46:14] out and try hyperbloom C6 Electro
[00:46:17] Infinity higher
[00:46:20] read that
[00:46:25] randomizer maybe after okay Rift towns
[00:46:28] and fatherless Flames that means we need
[00:46:31] Hydro her thousands are annoying but it
[00:46:33] is what it is
[00:46:34] the [ __ ] is all this
[00:46:36] that's a lot of enemies
[00:46:39] uh Simon's back Simon's
[00:46:42] kind of annoying but assignment's okay
[00:46:45] we still only need Hydro
[00:46:46] 12-3
[00:46:48] this looks easy these look annoying
[00:46:50] these two look annoying but 12 2 doesn't
[00:46:52] look that bad it's just a bunch of
[00:46:53] enemies
[00:46:56] okay
[00:46:58] wait are these the big ones or the small
[00:46:59] ones do they touch tips but this small
[00:47:01] Bishop what are these ones called
[00:47:03] but this small Vision hatchling okay so
[00:47:05] these are the big ones
[00:47:07] okay so shallow's good against these but
[00:47:09] he's not good against assignment so you
[00:47:10] probably put him first half
[00:47:12] oh but you need a hydro character but
[00:47:13] he's good against Rift towns
[00:47:20] well I'll probably play in both halves
[00:47:21] [ __ ] it
[00:47:23] yeah they're playing first half with a
[00:47:25] hydro character yeah like Elon or second
[00:47:27] half but then a Simon you want Electro
[00:47:29] dendro so you kind of don't want to
[00:47:31] or you just ignore it and then you just
[00:47:33] wait
[00:47:34] like you don't need Electro dendro but
[00:47:36] you kind of want it
[00:47:37] just time it right yeah but yeah if you
[00:47:41] don't need the DPS track though it goes
[00:47:42] invisible and then you're just waiting
[00:47:45] okay
[00:47:51] floor nine doesn't matter
[00:47:53] who are you playing chat
[00:47:55] play 36 clear 20 Subs
[00:47:58] Clee 36 star clear 20 Subs
[00:48:07] why would you say that
[00:48:09] why would you say that
[00:48:13] black tea mango donated one dollar plink
[00:48:18] I mean okay to be fair our shout team
[00:48:21] could fit clear I think we could do
[00:48:25] clee
[00:48:27] Bennett
[00:48:29] faruzan
[00:48:32] and Xiao
[00:48:36] but we need hydro and 12 so
[00:48:47] second half we could do Nikita yilon

[00:48:57] where's cookie
[00:48:59] and then Cleve
[00:49:05] all right that's gonna be our team
[00:49:11] all right
[00:49:13] uh for this floor it doesn't matter
[00:49:15] though we'll just do like Venti
[00:49:19] Bennett
[00:49:21] jangling and the first half we'll do
[00:49:23] farzan Xiao
[00:49:26] where's Kazo

[00:52:11] okay now we can play our clear half
[00:52:16] off
[00:52:18] [Music]
[00:52:26] okay well I guess I'm not getting my
[00:52:28] burst [ __ ] it CLE time
[00:52:35] yo what's that dude we had 2.8k that's
[00:52:38] not bad time for takeoff
[00:52:41] actually not bad wait we still have
[00:52:43] hydro somehow it's actually clutch
[00:52:47] if we go
[00:52:52] three times
[00:52:57] look I know how to watch this
[00:52:59] watch
[00:53:05] fomo
[00:53:07] never mind
[00:53:20] [Music]
[00:53:24] oh wait I didn't play the okay Chad
[00:53:26] before we actually do the abyss I made a
[00:53:28] new uh musical Journey playlist as I do
[00:53:30] with every single new Abyss uh this one
[00:53:33] is especially a journey it is one of the
[00:53:35] most ambitious ones to your ear going
[00:53:38] from genre to genre defining the meta
[00:53:40] and we're gonna listen to it with no
[00:53:42] Shuffle
[00:53:45] it is not NPC it's just definitely a
[00:53:47] journey so like just just just listen
[00:53:50] with open ears
[00:53:52] because you will be confused
[00:53:56] also enough to BRB in like a few minutes
[00:53:57] to go get another coffee
[00:54:00] um
[00:54:02] but as always we made another one this
[00:54:05] is our 12th
[00:54:08] with K-pop to hip-hop the hard style to
[00:54:11] emo and metal and then it Loops so
[00:54:14] that's what we're gonna do here let's do
[00:54:15] it with no Shuffle because it gets
[00:54:17] progressively hyper
[00:54:19] uh yeah so [ __ ] you guys
[00:54:26] there are leaves around there are leaves
[00:54:29] around

[00:55:18] just brace yourself
[00:55:20] [Music]
[00:55:29] yeah that was pretty good clean that's
[00:55:31] actually pretty good clean damage
[00:55:34] all right floor 10 uh what is this I
[00:55:37] don't think it matters but we have to
[00:55:39] use CLE so we might as well put her
[00:55:41] second half
[00:55:43] wait what what's here wait oh my God
[00:55:45] okay Glee
[00:55:48] where's clee
[00:55:50] I don't know oh there
[00:55:53] clean Bennett
[00:55:55] Venti
[00:55:58] honestly I don't think we need another
[00:56:00] character I think we can carry with this
[00:56:01] just these three
[00:56:08] casual
[00:56:12] Tarzan and then we need something to
[00:56:13] swirl I'm thinking windy plant so let's
[00:56:15] do baiju
[00:56:16] or actually we'll do Kirara
[00:56:18] a good team
[00:56:21] good team
[00:56:26] fast version yeah I'm not gonna listen
[00:56:28] to the [ __ ] if there's okay whenever
[00:56:30] there's that explicit and a non-explicit
[00:56:32] I'm not adding the [ __ ] radio
[00:56:34] friendly one to my playlist
[00:56:48] boring
[00:56:50] foreign
[00:57:00] worthless
[00:57:01] cheer
[00:57:05] worthless
[00:57:06] cheer
[00:57:08] worthless dude some of you guys are too
[00:57:09] harsh on Daya it's actually [ __ ] that
[00:57:12] you think she doesn't do enough damage
[00:57:13] when she does about one to two of my
[00:57:16] showers plunges in her whole burst not
[00:57:18] every new character can be Shao
[00:57:21] not every character has to be Shao
[00:57:26] she does like one punch
[00:57:32] wait how are we gonna clear this
[00:57:36] wait we've actually lose weight
[00:57:41] um
[00:57:43] wait I don't even know if I can clear
[00:57:49] okay
[00:57:51] snapshot I think you can get away
[00:57:55] because these guys don't even get sucked
[00:57:56] by ventially
[00:58:02] [Music]
[00:58:05] I'm not stamina

[00:58:11] oh we play shower but Pyro
[00:58:17] there's actually met up
[00:58:25] break yourself time for takeoff okay why
[00:58:28] did I make this floor harder than it has
[00:58:30] to be
[00:58:33] quiet
[00:58:35] I can't hear [ __ ]
[00:58:41] [Music]
[00:58:43] Okay click there
[00:58:47] I've never seen clear plunge attack
[00:58:49] before yeah then you're not a true
[00:58:50] Clement like me
[00:58:55] all right watch this we set up a nice
[00:58:57] dendro swirl we swirled that draw
[00:58:59] Caswell suck him up
[00:59:03] another dead
[00:59:17] can I want to play crit causo but I
[00:59:19] don't feel like un gearing him and we
[00:59:20] don't have artifact presets
[00:59:24] here we go I think you can get away no
[00:59:28] dude thank God I also
[00:59:31] an accident
[00:59:35] that is awkward that is so awkward well
[00:59:41] you will be missed Cleveland
[01:00:07] here we go
[01:00:13] what's an artifact preset imagine if you
[01:00:16] could save different artifact loadouts
[01:00:18] per character so you don't have to keep
[01:00:19] swapping them whenever you want to like
[01:00:21] change teams like for example my causal
[01:00:23] could have an em build and a crit build
[01:00:25] and my foreign
[01:00:33] but no
[01:00:34] we do not have that unfortunately
[01:00:48] that was easy
[01:00:54] dude my clean is like level six okay the
[01:00:56] death was not my fault
[01:00:59] he had no HB
[01:01:00] watch this watch as you get hit better
[01:01:02] you can hit venty with Bennett see you
[01:01:07] wait wrong one
[01:01:13] brace yourself time for takeoff

[01:01:19] so I'm happy Vlog friends can't hear the
[01:01:21] song so I'm gonna say it
[01:01:22] this song has been stuck in my head and
[01:01:25] I really like it but I hate the English
[01:01:26] parts of it I don't know why
[01:01:28] I just think they sound cringe
[01:01:31] so yeah
[01:01:34] okay uh
[01:01:38] wait what the [ __ ] is this 411 changed
[01:01:42] I guess it always changes but

[01:01:47] physical damage
[01:01:50] [Music]
[01:01:56] um
[01:01:57] we just play Xiao I think the first half
[01:01:59] is anti-physical
[01:02:01] but second half
[01:02:04] we could play eulo do we want to play

[01:11:28] and uh yeah
[01:11:30] so you can catch me there
[01:11:38] okay well I'll just play watch us play
[01:11:39] you see how this guy's about to die
[01:11:40] right I swap out of my ALT like they are
[01:11:43] jumping to get particles then I dash
[01:11:45] dash cast everything on ciao Bennett
[01:11:49] optimal
[01:11:50] can you use your alarm without hyphen
[01:11:51] yes you can do Elon Al Haytham then
[01:11:54] Electro and you're hyperlooming while
[01:11:55] spreading
[01:11:57] like cookie and then I do like nahita
[01:11:58] last lot gray POG let's get you on the
[01:12:01] business
[01:12:08] I'm in European I'm gonna say my whole e
[01:12:11] for the next enemy
[01:12:13] eye for an eye
[01:12:17] oh 300 000.
[01:12:22] midnight fantastic
[01:12:25] I've been playing so much Dale you
[01:12:27] really looks good
[01:12:30] to me for mercy
[01:12:32] freeze to the car
[01:12:37] finally hi oh [ __ ] wait in the middle
[01:12:41] stay in the middle
[01:12:43] [ __ ] I didn't quit
[01:12:44] no no no step back
[01:12:48] lights out let's keep going team shut up
[01:12:57] the odds are against it
[01:13:04] yo if I got hit by that I would have
[01:13:05] molded
[01:13:06] I would have committed arson in game
[01:13:14] end game
[01:13:17] why do you solve star rail guides uh I
[01:13:20] had to go for the ultra but I'll
[01:13:21] probably make a blade one because blade
[01:13:23] is hot
[01:13:25] cannot use
[01:13:31] I don't think I've ever seen this
[01:13:32] [ __ ] this tax line
[01:13:35] what the hell
[01:13:37] okay
[01:13:41] okay I just need a pyro Shield
[01:13:45] wait did I need Hydro
[01:13:48] I didn't check the enemies wait that's
[01:13:51] fine it's fine
[01:13:58] I didn't check
[01:14:00] surely it's fine
[01:14:03] worthless that's not gonna hit him
[01:14:08] [Music]
[01:14:12] without Causeway the more I think Craig
[01:14:14] coso is like Loki optimal because your
[01:14:16] last thought literally is useless unless
[01:14:18] you have like C6 Toma so you might as
[01:14:20] well have a crit causing a group [ __ ]
[01:14:21] for your child
[01:14:22] unironically
[01:14:26] okay we got some clean game plan
[01:14:31] uh wait let me not die let me not die
[01:14:33] let me know
[01:14:35] disappear
[01:14:38] I probably should have swirled the cryo
[01:14:41] but this works
[01:14:45] yc6 Toma so Thomas actually like Loki
[01:14:49] optimal on this team because his C6
[01:14:51] gives you 15 plunge damage I think uh
[01:14:54] and he also can give you a shield a
[01:14:56] little bit of power damage and power
[01:14:57] resonance which is like a lot of attack
[01:14:59] right so power resonance plus plunge
[01:15:02] attack damage uh and usually zhangly is
[01:15:05] better but zhangli gives you rest tread
[01:15:08] and milith but if you have C6 fars on
[01:15:10] you already have milif if you don't have
[01:15:12] C6 powers on drawing is probably like
[01:15:14] definitely better but if you do then you
[01:15:16] don't need the MILF anymore so zhangly
[01:15:17] can really use a a good set
[01:15:20] so Tomah could like Edge out on it
[01:15:24] bro I didn't ask okay
[01:15:26] all right the same logic applies with
[01:15:27] scarra in case you're wondering
[01:15:29] so for future skara hoppers in chat
[01:15:32] you're welcome no no no
[01:15:36] snap
[01:15:41] at one two hold e One Two Buckle sorry
[01:15:48] cool uh wolves Grayson actually came in
[01:15:50] clutch well actually buffed us
[01:15:54] we have no energy but I do have energy
[01:15:58] cool
[01:15:59] let's keep going boom officials
[01:16:07] I want to hold Ian head both surely I
[01:16:09] hit both here I think I hit both yeah I
[01:16:12] did
[01:16:19] wait you guys aren't ready for the EULA
[01:16:20] charge attack rotation
[01:16:22] e and then you charge attack
[01:16:30] try that again I have no stamina
[01:16:36] cool
[01:16:41] ER things are two months two months and
[01:16:43] him already going insane
[01:16:51] we did need Hydro
[01:17:00] [ __ ] everybody
[01:17:13] no when does this guy explode that took
[01:17:15] six years
[01:17:21] Kyle lowkey forgot the timing has been
[01:17:22] that long
[01:17:24] time
[01:17:35] no
[01:17:36] no
[01:17:38] what the [ __ ] okay okay I don't have
[01:17:41] that I don't have the elements I don't
[01:17:43] have the elements needed
[01:17:50] disappear
[01:17:51] to mess with me
[01:17:55] I'm just saying this for iframes
[01:18:02] I have the lamenta not die I forget did
[01:18:05] I needed the iframes you guys think I'm
[01:18:07] kidding I actually would have died I had
[01:18:09] to do a day on child
[01:18:11] dare to mess with me
[01:18:14] yes
[01:18:18] dude I didn't know I needed a hydro I
[01:18:20] didn't look at the enemies
[01:18:41] dude why is this guy's so annoying
[01:18:45] [ __ ] fatherless flames
[01:18:50] Michael
[01:18:51] I was [ __ ]
[01:18:53] at least animo's broken for that
[01:19:00] okay that shout I say what you will but
[01:19:04] me cancel
[01:19:05] actually genius because all my
[01:19:07] characters were burning if I didn't have
[01:19:09] the iframes where I bet it to get
[01:19:10] particles and to dodge attack I actually
[01:19:12] wait I didn't hold them what did I just
[01:19:14] do with my whatever I actually would
[01:19:15] have died
[01:19:19] wait oh I didn't know this guy
[01:19:31] better
[01:19:50] oh for 12.
[01:19:54] there's all the subs guys appreciate it
[01:19:56] okay ready
[01:20:06] oh yeah we can Gamba
[01:20:11] I'm really struggling with Sino is he
[01:20:13] good and viable yes watch my Sino should
[01:20:16] you pull video because I feel like a lot
[01:20:17] of people play Sonic wrong like he's not
[01:20:18] like game breaking but he's pretty
[01:20:20] decent just play him in quick Bloom I
[01:20:21] think aggravates I know is copium
[01:20:23] like I know it's viable and stuff but I
[01:20:26] think um quick Bloom's a lot better
[01:20:29] so if you actually because in if you're
[01:20:31] just playing aggravate he just feels
[01:20:33] like a worse kaching who can't swap out
[01:20:35] as much but if you're playing quick
[01:20:36] Bloom he actually feels pretty good so
[01:20:38] especially in like content like this you
[01:20:39] have pretty good AOE content like this
[01:20:41] it's single Target but you can still
[01:20:42] clear it and then probably the last half
[01:20:43] too so you would play something like I
[01:20:46] could do asano clear today but you do
[01:20:48] something like Sino and then dendro so
[01:20:49] you could do Nikita but if you don't
[01:20:50] have Nikita it's fine
[01:20:52] um you don't want kind of fast Android
[01:20:55] though if you're hyper booming but
[01:20:56] anyways just dendro you can even use DMC
[01:20:58] but then you play circle and pack that's
[01:20:59] fine you do dendro and then you do Hydro
[01:21:02] uh either fast or slow and then another
[01:21:05] Electro or actually Flex last slot it's
[01:21:08] like let's say you want a fast
[01:21:10] um Hydro you do like Synchro yolan and
[01:21:13] then last thought is whatever
[01:21:15] you could double dendro if your first
[01:21:17] dendro is not super fast you could
[01:21:19] double up like you could do like this
[01:21:21] that's all I mean that's technically all
[01:21:23] five stars but it could literally be
[01:21:24] like this right and that's all free to
[01:21:27] play character well four star characters
[01:21:30] but you kind of want an electro battery
[01:21:31] here so I don't like it as much I would
[01:21:33] like more in a four-star team you might
[01:21:35] want to do like this this is not bad
[01:21:38] the only problem here is like your hydro
[01:21:40] is really slow so you're mostly
[01:21:42] okay so here's how Sonic works I'm just
[01:21:45] gonna explain this once
[01:21:46] this does aggravate right then if you
[01:21:48] add Hydro
[01:21:50] if it's slow Hydro you're mainly going
[01:21:52] to aggravate with some occasional hyper
[01:21:54] blooms plus like 30k damage 25 whatever
[01:21:56] here and there just bonus damage if
[01:21:58] you're going fast Hydro you lose out on
[01:22:00] some sign or damage because you're not
[01:22:01] uh spreading as much no no sorry
[01:22:04] aggravating as much but you're getting
[01:22:05] more hyper blooms and usually your Hydra
[01:22:07] character is so broken that it makes up
[01:22:09] for it which is why I still recommend
[01:22:10] hyperbloom over just standard quick
[01:22:12] Bloom but you still get a decent amount
[01:22:14] of quickens so it's still good and
[01:22:16] usually if you have fast Android 2 you
[01:22:17] can do something like
[01:22:18] like I really like this team or yolan
[01:22:21] here and then your last lot is flexible
[01:22:22] and it's really really good
[01:22:24] and that's when I think Sino shines
[01:22:26] because if you're just playing Sino in
[01:22:27] an aggravate team he's usually just the
[01:22:29] worst kaching who can't swap as much but
[01:22:31] if you're playing aggravate and some
[01:22:32] hyperloom that needs he could be better
[01:22:36] anyways
[01:22:37] does the gays are wondering okay
[01:22:40] for 12.
[01:22:43] I asked I asked
[01:22:47] do you have to start a new account right
[01:22:48] now who would you pull for I have a free
[01:22:50] to play count and it has you love so
[01:22:51] don't ask me that
[01:22:53] but the like high value supports are
[01:22:56] always what you want an account and then
[01:22:57] your favorite DPS characters
[01:22:59] so like go for high value supports like
[01:23:01] nahita Causeway Elon or whatever Hydro
[01:23:03] you want a lot of hydros are good even
[01:23:04] kokomi
[01:23:11] anyways we're gonna play Xiao live laugh
[01:23:14] Lament
[01:23:16] would kokomi begin outside of Team yeah
[01:23:18] kokomi and Barbara are the same role
[01:23:20] there so it would be the slow Hydro
[01:23:21] instead of the fast one still fine
[01:23:29] uh I want to play Zhao in either first
[01:23:33] or second half and we are getting
[01:23:36] you missed a pay Dono
[01:23:43] but Taylor there's a 500 bits
[01:23:45] said Pride 500 I asked

[01:27:12] okay Chad you guys think I can 36 star
[01:27:14] without dying if I have to play Clee I
[01:27:16] think we do second half kokomi no she's
[01:27:21] on full em
[01:27:24] foreign
[01:27:58] I thought you said you geared before
[01:28:00] starting stream [ __ ] you
[01:28:03] I did but I didn't think this would I
[01:28:05] would have to play this team
[01:28:24] but so this is easy if you fail you suck
[01:28:27] listen I'm not gonna fail okay I'm not
[01:28:30] but I'm also I have to play a level 40
[01:28:33] or 60 clear uh clean
[01:28:35] and I have to make sure if I die once
[01:28:37] it's considered a fail if I reset once
[01:28:40] it's considered a fail so I have to make
[01:28:42] sure I'm not letting Believers down
[01:28:44] also there's Rift towns
[01:28:47] whoa I believe you can do it with Clay
[01:28:50] cause you're a gigant
[01:28:58] can we play Xiao
[01:29:03] bars on Bennett
[01:29:06] get along

[01:29:47] but then dude Clee really [ __ ] this
[01:29:49] team over because Nikita would be so
[01:29:52] good here
[01:29:54] ah a

[01:30:10] all my points no we're gonna win yeah I
[01:30:13] could Nikita on field oh I'm not on
[01:30:15] deepwood on a high thumb

[01:30:40] XD
[01:30:41] you have two minutes to vote while I
[01:30:43] finished gearing these teams
[01:30:47] no no it's fine I don't like mods can do
[01:30:49] predictions but for these ones I like to
[01:30:50] have my team set up first so it's not a
[01:30:52] scam that's why I like to wait a bit
[01:30:54] it's fine
[01:30:55] um we might just do the heater because
[01:30:56] she's on deepwood but he don't might die
[01:30:58] whoa yeah we'll do I'll hide them let me
[01:31:01] put on I'll hide them on deep wood
[01:31:04] clean no no no

[01:31:11] relax
[01:31:23] what
[01:31:29] was my best feather it's on

[01:31:35] are these are like insane feathers and
[01:31:37] they're on no one
[01:31:46] which one's better attack yeah there's
[01:31:48] two rolls versus one critical but the
[01:31:49] Yar roll makes it I think they're both
[01:31:51] as good depends if we need ER or not I
[01:31:53] don't actually know I'm gonna assume we
[01:31:54] need the r because I don't have a
[01:31:55] denture battery
[01:31:59] I got
[01:32:05] very low ER because we're solo dendro
[01:32:07] wait do I have to go Fab oh [ __ ]
[01:32:12] it's fine okay wait what if I do em with
[01:32:13] ER
[01:32:15] oh I have one I forgot about it
[01:32:17] should be better 142 not bad not bad not
[01:32:20] bad
[01:32:25] clean oh that could work actually
[01:32:30] the chef could rate
[01:32:31] honestly
[01:32:38] that's enough credit we just do like two
[01:32:39] hits
[01:32:41] okay let's go
[01:32:44] wait why are yo okay I haven't seen this
[01:32:47] Abyss but there is no way you're
[01:32:49] doubting me there's no way you're
[01:32:52] doubting me in 412
[01:32:59] like yeah we're playing a clean team but
[01:33:02] but but but I could clear I could clear
[01:33:05] with my eyes closed
[01:33:09] I'll hide them
[01:33:13] sing troll
[01:33:15] cookie
[01:33:16] Clee first half ciao
[01:33:19] Tarzan
[01:33:23] Bennett
[01:33:31] wait
[01:33:38] no I think you'll answer a second
[01:33:41] I don't think we want that much Hydro
[01:33:56] Shirley kokomi can just do an off right
[01:33:59] Shirley kokomi can do enough because we
[01:34:01] need Hydro
[01:34:15] sing show is not gonna do [ __ ] like so
[01:34:17] single Target damage against Rift towns
[01:34:19] probably doesn't matter and xiao's gonna
[01:34:21] kill them all anyways at the same time
[01:34:22] like if sing show kills one shallows us
[01:34:25] to kill all the others so I don't think
[01:34:26] it matters second off as well you're
[01:34:27] killing four enemies at once if Synchro
[01:34:29] kills one of the four you still have to
[01:34:30] kill the other three same here I think I
[01:34:32] don't know what that means they're gonna
[01:34:33] look like but think should probably
[01:34:35] won't do [ __ ] there
[01:34:36] so I feel like you call me
[01:34:39] and then you don't want to even if you
[01:34:40] don't need a Healer you don't want to
[01:34:41] replace Bennett like at this point I
[01:34:42] still should play Bennett there's no
[01:34:44] reason to like bench him
[01:34:46] although grouping could be useful like
[01:34:48] causal there's a case for Kazo here but
[01:34:50] I think Ben is probably better
[01:34:54] all right I'm ready
[01:34:55] unfortunately we have to use clean but
[01:34:57] here's what it is
[01:35:02] no I like clean her outfit's cute

[01:46:17] for believers but we actually have time
[01:46:20] we have time easy easy
[01:46:28] okay well we did it that was a three-man
[01:46:31] team
[01:46:33] okay that actually wasn't that hard of
[01:46:35] an abyss what the hell
[01:46:38] time to make it harder with some
[01:46:39] challenge clears for no reason
[01:46:45] wait
[01:46:47] no
[01:46:50] okay well easy for believers and we used
[01:46:53] Klee and we didn't reset or die or miss
[01:46:57] anything in our rotation
[01:46:59] imagine doubting in a xylax stream ever
[01:47:02] there's a 10 gifted stay true to their
[01:47:05] word
[01:47:08] wait so why do those two [ __ ] not group
[01:47:14] Rises also why were there more doubters
[01:47:16] than believers
[01:47:29] live laugh laments now that was easy
[01:47:31] dude the last okay I'm gonna say it last
[01:47:33] Abyss was like nightmare fuel this one
[01:47:35] is like it's not just like you're taking
[01:47:36] your kid to a theme park it's still
[01:47:38] there might be some rides that are still
[01:47:40] nauseating it might be a little bit
[01:47:42] difficult but it's not the terrorizing
[01:47:44] Terror that was the last one
[01:47:48] it's like last Abyss was like if you're
[01:47:51] eating a sandwich
[01:47:52] and you're like man and the sandwich has
[01:47:54] no condiments they forgot the
[01:47:55] condensation they're like dude you're
[01:47:57] just eating like meat and then dry bread
[01:47:59] you're like dude I need some mustard
[01:48:00] where are the pickles where are my
[01:48:03] leaves of lettuce now you have like did
[01:48:04] socks I don't even like leaves of
[01:48:06] lettuce [ __ ] you grow up listen where if
[01:48:08] there's no Economist how are you gonna
[01:48:10] get it down and I'm just like look I
[01:48:12] welcome the challenge I want a challenge
[01:48:13] but let it be tasty okay if you add lots
[01:48:16] of this was like adding an extra slice
[01:48:18] of bread so you're taking this dry
[01:48:20] sandwich and you're adding more bread to
[01:48:22] it is it gonna be harder is it gonna be
[01:48:24] more calories sure but it's not gonna be
[01:48:26] the good ones that we want I want it to
[01:48:28] be easier to get down while still being
[01:48:30] more challenging I wanted Abyss that's
[01:48:32] like harder but but fun but exhilarating
[01:48:34] but challenging maybe maybe a different
[01:48:37] type of content but instead they're just
[01:48:39] adding more bread with no condiments and
[01:48:41] it's like you're just biting into into
[01:48:43] into into
[01:48:44] dry bread
[01:48:49] that's what consecrated beasts are dry
[01:48:51] bread
[01:48:55] anyways for 12.
[01:48:57] uh we're gonna play uh okay what should
[01:49:00] we play
[01:49:03] stop talking
[01:49:06] okay wait Beto's probably good here and
[01:49:09] then here it's fine because it's single
[01:49:10] Target but you just play official and
[01:49:12] then Beto's probably oh no there's this
[01:49:13] guy but still
[01:49:14] oh first off
[01:49:16] it's fine there
[01:49:18] okay
[01:49:20] well I think with like taser second off
[01:49:23] oh jss

[01:49:34] wait what do we play chat I'm gonna play
[01:49:36] Beto
[01:49:37] I'm gonna do like

[01:49:42] no second time
[01:49:44] is neelu good here
[01:49:48] wait you can play nilo first half
[01:49:51] yeah newly looks fine for Stuff
[01:49:57] these guys can also be frozen
[01:50:01] oh yeah freeze looks stupid here freeze
[01:50:04] looks so good here
[01:50:15] I kind of want to try Xiao second half
[01:50:18] my first time seeing you stream your
[01:50:20] chat is so friendly okay you have to be
[01:50:23] reading the wrong chat my chat is not
[01:50:25] friendly however minty thank you for the
[01:50:27] five pounds I appreciate it
[01:50:29] minus five
[01:50:33] paid chatter
[01:50:40] okay I'm not playing nearly Bloom [ __ ]
[01:50:42] it
[01:50:44] why does he have level 90 shinyan
[01:50:47] awareness please there's uh there was a
[01:50:50] reason
[01:50:53] risotto think so six months
[01:50:58] oh we could also play Scara
[01:51:13] okay fully M boom
[01:51:15] yeah goblet
[01:51:18] boom
[01:51:25] yeah this Abyss does look good for nilu
[01:51:29] if I am being honest
[01:51:32] so we can just play nearly bloom
[01:51:36] um well I need to give Al heighten his
[01:51:38] gilded back
[01:51:40] Bulls win
[01:51:43] oh yeah we have to play Kaya we'll do a
[01:51:44] four-star okay we're gonna do at least
[01:51:46] three clears we're gonna do another five
[01:51:47] star clear and then we're gonna do a
[01:51:50] four star only clear and then we also
[01:51:51] need to do I also need Scara footage
[01:51:54] but that doesn't have to be today
[01:52:02] wait where the [ __ ] is my what did what
[01:52:05] does nahida have
[01:52:16] wait this doesn't look right something's
[01:52:18] not right
[01:52:20] oh yeah what is this
[01:52:34] ratio here better
[01:52:39] all right we can send it again
[01:52:42] um
[01:52:43] nilu was so free really I mean it looks
[01:52:46] good for her but I guess we'll try it I
[01:52:48] guess all the enemies are kind of just
[01:52:49] grouped and then they get [ __ ] so
[01:52:50] makes sense
[01:52:53] let's go
[01:52:57] we'll do four stars after this now we'll
[01:52:59] do nilu Nikita
[01:53:02] Kirara
[01:53:05] and uh
[01:53:12] uh kokomi second off we'll play
[01:53:19] wait Chad can we brute force a Simon
[01:53:22] I think we could Brute Force the Simon
[01:53:24] without dendro or Electro
[01:53:32] because you just have to wait for a bit
[01:53:33] right
[01:53:36] yeah it was very easy yeah
[01:53:39] like I know we can basically one rotate
[01:53:41] of a shot it's just annoying that you
[01:53:42] have to wait but I do like clearing a
[01:53:43] child both halves just to make sure so I
[01:53:45] think we'll do that you could also play
[01:53:46] Beto
[01:53:48] a little bit after okay ciao
[01:53:52] baru Ben 10
[01:53:55] and then they are
[01:54:04] actually we'll do Thomas
[01:54:09] boring teams play yoemia or rutau okay
[01:54:12] look I love hutau joy Mia is cool but in
[01:54:15] no [ __ ] world is blooming everything
[01:54:17] boring compared to spamming Mouse one
[01:54:20] with yomiya I don't care how delude you
[01:54:22] have to be next level delusionally in
[01:54:24] love with yomiya to think that that is
[01:54:27] more fun and enjoyable to watch than
[01:54:29] nilu bloom I'm sorry I said it that is
[01:54:32] like next level
[01:54:37] well I don't even need it yet
[01:54:44] guy Loki [ __ ] up the rotation but it's
[01:54:46] fine
[01:55:00] positions

[01:55:11] foreign
[01:55:31] [Music]

[01:57:20] that way yep boom then we
[01:57:30] are

[01:57:56] we should probably go to the bow dude
[01:57:58] right I'm just trying to see how to

[01:58:03] why is he getting pushed backwards
[01:58:06] you please

[01:59:44] all right
[01:59:49] 12-2 second half
[02:00:01] I could have lamented there but I don't
[02:00:04] think it's worth it maybe it was
[02:00:08] I'm just gonna wait
[02:00:10] wait should I hold this
[02:00:12] this word far is that all things does
[02:00:13] anyone know
[02:00:17] because I know he's right here
[02:00:25] yeah okay well I'll do it
[02:00:29] I wasn't sure it was worth committing
[02:00:31] because I know you can break them by
[02:00:33] just brute forcing but
[02:00:35] oh well never mind
[02:00:39] well we missed it
[02:00:49] it's fine we have five lines for a
[02:00:52] reason
[02:00:53] look at this
[02:00:57] are you [ __ ] we're conquering tear
[02:01:05] oh yeah we could have just done that
[02:01:06] we're gonna save so much time
[02:01:11] dude this is really tooting my horn
[02:01:15] this is really making me angry
[02:01:18] three disappear
[02:01:25] okay
[02:01:27] I mean it's doable that's annoying
[02:01:30] nice 11k plunges nice 11 minute timeout
[02:01:35] it's 30 seconds but you get the point
[02:01:44] here
[02:01:54] [Music]
[02:01:57] okay I'm Hydro devops I don't want to
[02:01:59] use my burst
[02:02:00] let's just chill we could use our skill
[02:02:03] though
[02:02:10] why are they not grouping am I bad yes
[02:02:13] okay
[02:02:34] forgot oh wait she TV to us wait that's
[02:02:36] huge
[02:02:44] guy Loki feel like I should put yolan on
[02:02:46] this team instead of the second dendro
[02:02:48] which is the alarm because I feel like
[02:02:49] our thing like sometimes they're just
[02:02:51] not grouped that our signal 30 damage
[02:02:52] sucks so maybe we just put yellow on and
[02:02:54] see each other
[02:02:55] all right what is this oh yeah these
[02:02:56] guys
[02:02:57] oh [ __ ] I have no energy
[02:03:00] but I have no energy no no okay don't
[02:03:04] get too close
[02:03:09] yet
[02:03:14] all right
[02:03:18] oh my dude imagine if I use C6 out here
[02:03:22] literally the best character
[02:03:25] also Xiao can hit both with his punches
[02:03:27] pretty consistently which is good
[02:03:29] because I was having trouble like
[02:03:31] hitting both last time but
[02:03:39] I'm going yeah Charles also gets a Simon
[02:03:41] but he's actually really good here
[02:03:42] because yeah I can always well I missed
[02:03:43] this one but I can like basically always
[02:03:45] punch both
[02:03:46] poggers
[02:03:49] thumb
[02:03:51] yeah
[02:03:53] I mean this is pretty easy but
[02:03:56] I just lamented
[02:03:59] all right four star clear time
[02:04:08] what's the reason for Tomah yeah uh yeah
[02:04:11] I explained it earlier there's an
[02:04:13] exclamation there's a clip exclamation
[02:04:15] mark why are you using wait what is it
[02:04:17] wait there's a Tomah command what is it
[02:04:19] called nightbot let me let me see let me
[02:04:21] pull it up
[02:04:25] no no it's exp y Toma but there's a
[02:04:27] longer name for it I know there's more
[02:04:29] than one let me look
[02:04:31] oh wait that's it okay I'm gonna add a
[02:04:33] new command
[02:04:35] it's gonna be exclamation mark why are
[02:04:38] you using Tomah with
[02:04:40] Xiao and Scara please explain I'm gonna
[02:04:44] put it on a 45 second cooldown
[02:04:50] yeah
[02:04:52] let me see if it works
[02:04:54] exclamation mark why are you using Tomah
[02:04:57] with Xiao and Scara please explain
[02:05:07] oh there's it's missing an e
[02:05:11] there you go now it should be better
[02:05:15] now it should work let's see what the
[02:05:16] clip is
[02:05:18] [Music]
[02:05:22] wondering why am I using Tomah in this
[02:05:23] team
[02:05:24] for friendship but also Tome is pretty
[02:05:26] good with wander why good question in
[02:05:29] this team farcon generates negative
[02:05:30] energy and needs over
[02:05:33] respectable family-friendly streamer
[02:05:35] okay so to help alleviate her energy
[02:05:37] needs and also your Bennett who normally
[02:05:39] doesn't have a problem but since farzan
[02:05:41] is such a [ __ ] doesn't generate
[02:05:43] energy you'll also need another pyro
[02:05:44] character for your Bennett furthermore
[02:05:46] Scaramouche without a shield makes you
[02:05:48] want to commit Minecraft so you can run
[02:05:50] a shield to help with that furthermore
[02:05:52] you can run favonius Lance at a
[02:05:54] supportive artifact set while also being
[02:05:56] able although okay but we'll also being
[02:05:59] able to have a C6 to buff your normal
[02:06:01] and plunge and charge attacks wow I love
[02:06:04] Thomas also you get pyro resonance which
[02:06:06] is pretty good in the team
[02:06:08] true and if your father's on C6 you
[02:06:10] already have someone on um Millet so you
[02:06:12] don't need Zhang Li and then farzan uh
[02:06:14] uh and then Tomah gives you power
[02:06:16] resonance and C6 gives you 15 plunge
[02:06:18] damage and
[02:06:19] the shield and other stuff so yeah
[02:06:29] okay
[02:06:39] uh let's do a four star clear now but we
[02:06:42] have to use Force our weapons so let's
[02:06:44] change all of our uh Bennett is on
[02:06:47] aquilis vivonius we'll change that to
[02:06:49] sapwood
[02:06:50] uh we're also gonna play
[02:06:57] am I playing yeah yeah or cute kiwawa
[02:06:59] we're gonna play sucrose Beto sing Cho
[02:07:09] no maybe not
[02:07:13] we're not playing that team we could do
[02:07:14] I mean
[02:07:20] I can all play taser without dendro but
[02:07:21] you kind of need dendro second off or
[02:07:23] wanted at least so we're gonna play
[02:07:24] dendro so I think we do
[02:07:28] yeah yeah whatever dandrill character
[02:07:31] Beto
[02:07:36] sing show
[02:07:39] those are just aggravate we don't really
[02:07:41] need hyperbloom
[02:07:43] Daya is a three star dude she's not a
[02:07:47] three star
[02:07:52] okay we could gear yeah I mean
[02:07:53] instructor's actually good on her yeah
[02:07:54] we'll keep instructor
[02:07:56] um like if we're playing aggravate
[02:07:58] instructor's the best
[02:08:00] is anyone else we're gonna use black
[02:08:02] Cliff these are all four star weapons
[02:08:04] right changling tell me why shangly well
[02:08:08] I can play music again
[02:08:12] I'm playing Seven again [ __ ] it uh okay

[02:08:36] everyone's geared right
[02:08:38] yes okay
[02:08:39] oh official's on Polar wait that's bad
[02:08:41] that's a four that's not a four star
[02:08:43] uh we could do stringless
[02:08:46] but now we probably don't have enough
[02:08:47] crit rate yeah
[02:08:58] this one maybe it's not bad
[02:09:02] now we don't have enough good damage
[02:09:04] sorry uh we can get more damage maybe
[02:09:07] like this
[02:09:11] okay cool
[02:09:12] hold on four star artifacts too no no
[02:09:18] but four star characters
[02:09:20] okay so we're gonna do
[02:09:26] we'll do Baidu second half we'll do Beto
[02:09:30] official
[02:09:32] um
[02:09:33] Yao times two
[02:09:36] are Yao squared
[02:09:38] because it's probably Yao and then times
[02:09:40] Yahoo so yeah and then
[02:09:46] yeah L squared and then
[02:09:50] um yeah to the power of Yao
[02:09:54] this
[02:09:57] and then
[02:09:59] sucrose
[02:10:01] first half we will do

[02:10:28] we could also do a [ __ ] quick swap
[02:10:30] freeze team we could do some like
[02:10:33] some cringe [ __ ] but then we need
[02:10:35] sucrose there
[02:10:46] this would be so much better with Kazo
[02:10:47] though
[02:10:58] Hazel wait actually what if my Hazel
[02:11:03] freeze well I am so down you don't

[02:11:25] I mean okay Barbara's fine here
[02:11:26] unironically we could just Barbara
[02:11:35] yeah I guess we don't need a Healer
[02:11:38] okay we can do that after let's start
[02:11:40] with uh let's just play Reverse Bob
[02:11:42] can we break these with the reverse
[02:11:43] melts probably right yeah

[02:11:48] play freeze after I want to play an
[02:11:49] actual free scene with five stars
[02:11:51] so I know freeze doesn't need healing
[02:11:53] but Rift hounds really can [ __ ] you like
[02:11:55] Rift sounds plus fatherless flames you
[02:11:57] kind of want a Healer but maybe we could
[02:11:59] do fine without it
[02:12:01] okay we're gonna try these teams

[02:14:07] I thought I was about to get healed you
[02:14:09] know what I wanted to reset so that I
[02:14:11] could get a faster clear anyways
[02:14:15] that's fine
[02:14:17] it's actually fun
[02:14:20] I actually lagged that's why
[02:14:23] [ __ ] I didn't get energy from that
[02:14:26] life
[02:14:29] don't get frostbite

[02:15:40] frostbite punishment
[02:15:42] judgment
[02:15:44] obviously Hydra would be better here and
[02:15:46] we could have used tincho but I feel
[02:15:48] like so [ __ ] you
[02:15:52] yeah
[02:15:57] this moment will be frozen
[02:16:00] let's Light It Up freeze

[02:17:21] reset yeah
[02:17:23] yo okay why did he not get quickened
[02:17:27] though
[02:17:46] Frostbite
[02:17:50] the steam is so good until you have to
[02:17:52] break up Hyrule Shield but that's not
[02:17:54] really the team's fault

[02:18:23] Dodge
[02:18:25] I actually dodged it for once
[02:18:29] no reason to snapshot because damage
[02:18:31] doesn't matter
[02:18:33] I'm just coping because I missed the
[02:18:35] snapshot but damage actually doesn't
[02:18:36] matter here so

[02:18:52] I don't I have
[02:18:56] where was my healing in the HP going

[02:19:45] oh that was slow
[02:19:49] whatever we don't need to snapshot
[02:19:51] because again here Diamond doesn't
[02:19:53] really matter I just have to kill this
[02:19:55] guy fast like we have to kill I guess
[02:19:57] damage matters until this Shield pops
[02:19:58] out but once The Shield's out you just
[02:19:59] need to up

[02:27:24] if we don't want to run a Healer
[02:27:26] we can also run like Layla but I feel
[02:27:28] like Rift Town corrosion is gonna [ __ ]
[02:27:29] us up high keep up with the fun content
[02:27:32] Diana's probably useless
[02:27:37] yeah I think you just go Barbara Saj
[02:27:43] [Music]
[02:27:47] but we're still capped
[02:27:58] rosempo's Black Knight dealer required
[02:28:00] yeah
[02:28:01] I do think a Healer is more like we're
[02:28:03] playing freeze so we technically don't
[02:28:05] need one but there's a lot of like [ __ ]
[02:28:06] that just damages you through Shields or
[02:28:08] whatever so or through freeze or
[02:28:10] whatever
[02:28:22] dude I wasn't capped okay we just got
[02:28:24] capped we're just uncapping vermilion's
[02:28:27] a good uncapped the domain what's with
[02:28:29] the Diana hate down is just not needed
[02:28:31] in freeze that's all but at least in our
[02:28:33] team because the EM she gives you is
[02:28:34] useless and then she just gives you a
[02:28:35] heal which is fine but that's like a
[02:28:37] waste of a slot if we don't need it
[02:28:43] but Barbara so
[02:28:45] wait where's my Bennett what's a Bennett
[02:28:48] no no
[02:28:53] well
[02:28:56] well minus one burst
[02:29:01] here
[02:29:03] please find emblem why would I do that
[02:29:06] what is more efficient
[02:29:08] emblem or Vermilion exactly which one
[02:29:11] gives ciao more damage which one
[02:29:14] Vermillion
[02:29:29] okay this time
[02:29:32] yeah to be fair we could do Synchro no
[02:29:35] but I wanted
[02:29:36] foreign
[02:29:46] prototype Amber Hazel
[02:29:58] saw you clears no because we're playing
[02:29:59] Cho so like I mean I guess you could
[02:30:01] just saw you q and then swap
[02:30:03] but
[02:30:06] I just loved Hazel I want to play his
[02:30:07] though
[02:30:18] chat surely sing show healing's enough
[02:30:19] right
[02:30:20] right surely right
[02:30:23] surely
[02:30:30] surely right
[02:30:33] Shirley
[02:30:43] you're dead
[02:30:45] you know I'm gonna show you guys not to
[02:30:48] judge a book by its cover
[02:31:00] yeah
[02:31:01] I'll put Barbara on full HP just in case
[02:31:03] though in case we have the user
[02:31:35] all right ready
[02:31:38] okay second off we're doing what the
[02:31:40] [ __ ] are we doing second half beta right
[02:31:41] Beto official Yao times two and then
[02:31:45] sucrose
[02:31:47] first half
[02:31:51] Kyle
[02:31:53] Rosario
[02:31:59] okay I feel like we are gonna get [ __ ]
[02:32:06] should I do Barbara
[02:32:31] okay we might as well see we might as
[02:32:34] well see if like we just die wait I
[02:32:36] don't have disc you I ran out of disk
[02:32:38] space
[02:32:40] wait let me uninstall something the [ __ ]
[02:33:01] okay we should be fine now
[02:33:04] uh we'll go ER
[02:33:09] okay there's a pretty decent chance that
[02:33:10] we just can't out heal this but we'll
[02:33:12] see
[02:33:16] okay we already got corrosion that's
[02:33:18] cool yeah
[02:33:44] that was pretty cracked what the [ __ ]
[02:33:48] yeah wait we're actually popping offline
[02:33:59] witness the power
[02:34:01] freeze Oh So Soft you can't run
[02:34:07] okay pressure
[02:34:21] well I actually do not need a Healer
[02:34:24] what the [ __ ]
[02:34:25] I guess it's freeze but still
[02:34:33] wait he's dead
[02:34:37] he's dead
[02:34:39] freeze
[02:34:41] wait that was easy as [ __ ] what
[02:34:49] it hurts
[02:34:50] can you die I don't use my bursts
[02:34:54] okay that was slow because we [ __ ]
[02:34:56] we screwed up the end but
[02:34:59] still
[02:35:04] I guess I do underrate synchro's healing
[02:35:06] but also most of it was just because we
[02:35:07] froze them
[02:35:13] that clear still wasn't super fast
[02:35:15] because I did [ __ ] it up a bit but
[02:35:18] we'll see if we get it if we don't three
[02:35:19] star we could do again all right we're
[02:35:21] gonna go right side e burst e burst e
[02:35:23] burst e burst e burst E
[02:35:28] I need to talk quick okay
[02:35:30] I need to do that on field to get the
[02:35:32] instructor set that's why we staged
[02:35:42] as you wish me please [ __ ] are you
[02:35:45] kidding
[02:35:46] are you or are you not kidding tell me
[02:35:48] please inform me
[02:36:08] oh my God he's not gonna
[02:36:12] it's been a long day without you
[02:36:17] shangling
[02:36:21] [Music]
[02:36:24] we're not restarting this
[02:36:28] whatever
[02:36:30] [Music]
[02:36:41] dude that was so close though
[02:36:47] okay we [ __ ] up first half also we're
[02:36:49] playing like listen
[02:36:55] it's double Oya for sure
[02:36:58] I just need to do this part faster
[02:37:10] I forgot that burst like kind of sucks
[02:37:12] the man I haven't played his in a while
[02:37:13] so that was something I should have done
[02:37:16] earlier
[02:37:21] it's actually important for me to like
[02:37:22] play every character decide like don't
[02:37:24] forget [ __ ] about their kids
[02:37:31] okay that was so much faster
[02:37:37] play Dory Okay maybe not that character
[02:37:41] it's okay if I forget a bit about her
[02:37:43] kid
[02:37:45] okay we need the process Shield fast no
[02:37:47] there you go
[02:38:08] Dodge this I'm gonna burst here [ __ ] it
[02:38:11] wait this is like a minute faster well
[02:38:13] depends how fast we killed this actually
[02:38:17] you can't run
[02:38:20] please die
[02:38:24] can you die cool not bad a lot faster
[02:38:31] team looks fun to use yeah it's pretty
[02:38:33] fun
[02:38:39] how about cave second half cavi could
[02:38:41] actually work here but then sucrose we
[02:38:42] do sucrose first half then
[02:38:46] actually no you can still play Hazel
[02:38:47] first half
[02:38:48] um
[02:38:49] yeah you could use Cafe on fields he's
[02:38:51] fine I'd probably put a hydro there
[02:38:58] if you want healing I guess like Cafe
[02:39:00] saw you
[02:39:02] but that's kind of weird
[02:39:05] all right let's go
[02:39:12] I didn't talk [ __ ] Quicken yet
[02:39:22] cool
[02:39:26] No Rest For The Win dude I couldn't
[02:39:30] Parry the [ __ ]
[02:39:40] this is bad
[02:39:47] night
[02:39:59] bro can you Groove yes or no
[02:40:07] maybe you're supposed to go left side
[02:40:09] maybe maybe this is a group on this guy
[02:40:11] actually I don't know
[02:40:20] [Music]
[02:40:21] dude what is the lower troll doing yeah
[02:40:25] yeah bro are you dumb
[02:40:29] is he going to [ __ ] go to his job why
[02:40:31] are you here
[02:40:34] okay I mean bro like that was dude like
[02:40:41] group I guess you're supposed to go this
[02:40:42] side dude
[02:40:44] it's fine we're learning we're learning
[02:40:46] we're learning the more retries the more
[02:40:48] we learn about this Abyss
[02:41:04] oh I'm so sorry
[02:41:10] dude these numbers are like so
[02:41:11] satisfying
[02:41:19] it's actually so satisfying
[02:41:22] structure
[02:41:24] to get frostbite
[02:41:28] oh we kind of [ __ ] this part up though
[02:41:30] but
[02:41:36] I don't know
[02:41:46] and I just get all my energy back
[02:41:48] because I had no energy and then like
[02:41:51] one second you gotta reverse back
[02:42:00] I knew that [ __ ] attack was coming
[02:42:02] it's delayed whenever he like gets
[02:42:04] Frozen and [ __ ] so I wasn't sure when I
[02:42:06] would come but it did
[02:42:08] and I dodged it
[02:42:12] wait he's dead wait
[02:42:18] what was that guys died so fast
[02:42:24] I'll just focus on like my rotation I
[02:42:25] didn't see them die
[02:42:28] okay battle time
[02:42:33] well Farm artifacts after maybe one more
[02:42:35] clear
[02:42:37] let's go
[02:43:05] okay so everything quiet a bit I'm kind
[02:43:08] of focusing oh okay
[02:43:11] he says as he gets louder
[02:43:25] Loki wasted sucrose's burst but all good
[02:43:34] that was a good swap into Perry's House
[02:43:36] truly a Beto player truly a battle man
[02:43:38] oh man
[02:43:42] bro
[02:43:43] it's a drop and groove
[02:43:53] As You Wish
[02:43:56] As You Wish Maine Pro Line
[02:44:05] oh he's dead easy
[02:44:14] by Royal Decree
[02:44:25] cool that was probably the hardest part
[02:44:27] of this holiday because like for those
[02:44:29] teams
[02:44:31] like Electro against electric Shields
[02:44:34] and [ __ ] was kind of annoying but now it
[02:44:34] should be easy
[02:44:57] reverse but all good
[02:45:07] bro where are you going
[02:45:10] like tell me where it'll be
[02:45:12] understanding but if you don't tell me
[02:45:13] how will I know
[02:45:22] oh God
[02:45:28] frostbite
[02:45:38] I died I died
[02:45:44] foreign
[02:46:28] eight piece for losers
[02:46:30] I don't need the HP
[02:46:32] lights
[02:46:38] this
[02:46:40] oh I'm so sorry wait unironically though
[02:46:42] unironically though unironically though
[02:46:45] here's all have your burst please please
[02:46:47] please please please
[02:46:51] wait wait let me cook freeze let me cook
[02:46:57] fruits frostbite
[02:47:00] to dodge this
[02:47:07] no my sword
[02:47:14] whoever let me in the kitchen deserves a
[02:47:16] race
[02:47:18] all I'm saying
[02:47:25] sorry
[02:47:48] for sure that Beto's not the best here
[02:47:50] but
[02:47:51] still good team's still gonna perform
[02:47:56] [Music]
[02:47:57] wait where'd my Electro go
[02:48:03] eyes on me
[02:48:06] foreign
[02:48:33] [Music]
[02:48:35] 6308
[02:48:49] okay two out of three
[02:48:54] easy two out of three
[02:48:56] I think for if we actually do a better
[02:48:58] shotgun so did first half though because
[02:48:59] more enemies I feel like
[02:49:01] actually no never mind there's abysmal
[02:49:03] Bishop all right let's go what is this
[02:49:04] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I don't have energy wait
[02:49:08] I have sex sword it's fine
[02:49:14] at least
[02:49:18] pressure
[02:49:26] I want that Rain Source to expire when
[02:49:28] I'm on Hazel but I think I missed them
[02:49:30] XD haha
[02:49:40] I'm gonna hurt my throat
[02:49:49] power
[02:49:59] never die
[02:50:01] frostbite Bring It On
[02:50:05] last one
[02:50:07] for our four star clear wait for
[02:50:09] someone's fine
[02:50:35] Hazel also makes sense in that team
[02:50:36] because Beto I mean sucrose doesn't like
[02:50:39] her I am buff is useless in a freeze
[02:50:41] team right so having like hazel actually
[02:50:44] makes sense
[02:50:45] because you if free seems really want
[02:50:47] like kazua
[02:50:48] but for an onfielder it doesn't make
[02:50:50] sense
[02:50:52] all right
[02:51:02] I have to make sure they're grouped
[02:51:04] enough forbido to actually bounce on
[02:51:06] them
[02:51:07] can Beto bounce
[02:51:18] oh I lost energy
[02:51:32] beta doesn't work here
[02:51:39] wait beta actually popped off there no
[02:51:40] don't push him you're great please
[02:51:44] yes
[02:51:45] we got the bedroom
[02:52:02] [Music]
[02:52:04] okay I would have cleared but I didn't
[02:52:05] want to use that as like background
[02:52:06] footage I don't want that to be in a
[02:52:08] video I would have cleared it would have
[02:52:09] been fine for the record we cleared
[02:52:11] there but I didn't want to have to use
[02:52:13] that in the video so for that's why
[02:52:14] we're trying but for the record we got
[02:52:16] it okay we actually got it for the
[02:52:18] record I just okay uh what is this okay
[02:52:22] okay
[02:52:41] I need to be on Hazel when the
[02:52:43] rainstorms expire
[02:52:44] so I got healed
[02:52:48] nice
[02:52:57] confess
[02:53:01] ions
[02:53:04] oh wait we grouped them dude
[02:53:08] wait we actually don't need a Healer
[02:53:11] will be frozen
[02:53:25] okay last one now we actually get it let
[02:53:28] me wait for them to group before betoing
[02:53:38] it looks fun it actually really is
[02:53:43] is there a specific vishap you should go
[02:53:45] to
[02:53:46] I feel like going here helps more
[02:53:48] because last time I went left and this
[02:53:50] guy just chilled but I don't know if
[02:53:51] they both just chill
[02:53:54] no
[02:53:56] Electro really
[02:53:58] okay I'll go to electron isn't that what
[02:54:00] I did oh no it's not yeah that's what I
[02:54:02] meant okay cool

[02:54:30] what the hell
[02:54:35] I lost my suitcase

[03:08:42] okay not to celebrate too early but
[03:08:44] Electro goblets are like low-key my
[03:08:45] worst so this could actually be really
[03:08:47] good
[03:08:51] wait pause job anyways for the for the
[03:08:54] sake we'll level this a second but for
[03:08:55] the sake of the Gamba

[03:09:18] circlet
[03:09:25] I rolled this off stream ha ha anyways
[03:09:34] that's fine
[03:09:39] it's fine HP on this that's good HP on
[03:09:42] this that's good
[03:09:44] unfortunately no one uses the set but
[03:09:45] you know it is what it is
[03:09:56] uh I mean HP on the set is good
[03:10:01] um
[03:10:03] but I don't know who would use this
[03:10:07] it's like Daya
[03:10:12] we'll leave it we'll just leave it we'll
[03:10:14] just leave it we'll just leave that plus
[03:10:16] 16. uh Electro goblet on this one this
[03:10:20] one is our Beauty
[03:10:22] last one I didn't care too much about
[03:10:24] this one
[03:10:25] this one however I do care about
[03:10:29] yeah we wasted our bad luck on the last
[03:10:31] artifact we put all our HP pieces there
[03:10:33] it rolls now we're gonna get the good
[03:10:35] rolls the crit rate the crit damage uh
[03:10:37] maybe attack percent but I'm feeling
[03:10:39] crit I'm feeling pretty
[03:10:41] I'm feeling crit
[03:10:43] I'm feeling crit
[03:10:47] I'm feeling critical
[03:11:35] foreign
[03:11:52] this goblet looks plus six
[03:11:57] I mean I guess the attacks the attack's
[03:11:59] fine
[03:12:02] it's fine
[03:12:05] it's fine
[03:12:10] um who would use this
[03:12:12] like uh like uh
[03:12:18] wow and it's offset
[03:12:29] this is actually as a Jeff piece
[03:12:35] well that was unfortunate
[03:12:40] Chad I'm trying to get an inventory full
[03:12:41] of five stars artifacts before um Fontan
[03:12:44] comes out look at how many we have I
[03:12:45] want to strongbox everything so we need
[03:12:48] to get rid of all these four stars
[03:12:50] and fill it out
[03:13:02] why sauce okay well we okay we don't
[03:13:06] know it's not confirmed but surely they
[03:13:09] add a new strong box like surely like it
[03:13:11] has to happen it's not a leak it's just
[03:13:13] like it has to
[03:13:15] so whatever
[03:13:22] pale flame first I'm not doing pale
[03:13:25] Flame
[03:13:36] we got strong box in 2.0 and 3.0
[03:13:38] obviously we'll get one in 4.0 that's
[03:13:39] what I'm saying that's literally what
[03:13:41] I'm saying
[03:13:52] okay what are we doing
[03:13:54] um I wanna do maybe another clear we
[03:13:56] could do scarra that's what I wanted to
[03:13:58] do
[03:14:00] but then who else uh we'll figure out
[03:14:02] let's go one more last one then we'll go
[03:14:05] to artifact farming
[03:14:23] we kind of need Hydro in this half
[03:14:27] to do like
[03:14:29] scarra
[03:14:34] barzan
[03:14:38] let's loop three times that's how long
[03:14:40] I've been doing this for
[03:14:42] it's [ __ ] one hour playlist
[03:14:45] or actually
[03:14:50] do I need a Healer here
[03:14:53] Maybe
[03:14:58] yeah scar without a Healer is kind of
[03:15:00] cool but we could just freeze
[03:15:10] turn it up
[03:15:11] I'm
[03:15:15] Layla did my Layla's level [ __ ] 50 or
[03:15:19] I would
[03:15:24] could you could call me
[03:15:30] kokomi shadow
[03:15:37] this team is so bad
[03:15:41] okay we get okay
[03:15:48] we'll play Kaya but let me give him
[03:15:50] energy regeneration I'll give him a Fab
[03:15:53] Ric
[03:15:55] and then we could go Blizzard's Trader
[03:15:57] but do I care
[03:16:00] yeah I guess I care
[03:16:02] we'll give him a welcome blizzard we'll
[03:16:04] give him blizzy
[03:16:10] what was that show jump scare yeah I
[03:16:12] know
[03:16:14] same one says
[03:16:21] quicker damage
[03:16:28] the infamous Kaya shield for scarra true
[03:16:32] we're like the only person in getting to
[03:16:34] have kayak on so get a shield Scara
[03:16:38] faru Singh Cho Kaya second half
[03:16:43] what should I play second half oh we can
[03:16:44] play oh I know sorry we can do Beto
[03:16:50] Big C
[03:16:53] yelling
[03:16:58] but I'm a Healer why do I keep making
[03:17:00] teams without healers what am I doing
[03:17:04] you can do baiju but then we would want
[03:17:07] Beto there
[03:17:11] I mean we could play Quicken quicken's
[03:17:13] worse than hyperbloom but it makes Vader
[03:17:15] shine a bit more if I make a beta video
[03:17:17] well I already have one done I just need
[03:17:18] background footage
[03:17:21] ah no it doesn't matter actually I'm
[03:17:22] gonna see his last of this
[03:17:27] this is a five-star team though
[03:17:31] whatever
[03:17:34] foreign
[03:17:42] we could have done this and that's like
[03:17:44] a little bit of Hydra you know
[03:17:48] where's kokomi yeah we can do this
[03:17:54] okay sure we'll do that
[03:17:56] Beto kokomi
[03:17:58] Nikita
[03:18:00] all right we'll put we'll put sign a
[03:18:02] second let's not sign off
[03:18:08] good combination rise for our leader
[03:18:16] go
[03:18:24] why is kill level 60 we literally just
[03:18:26] pulled for her that's why that's why we
[03:18:27] just pulled her that's why that's
[03:18:29] literally that we just got her that's
[03:18:30] why
[03:18:31] okay
[03:18:32] do I have a
[03:18:34] no one's on VV
[03:18:47] no one's a no blast either dude should I
[03:18:50] play scarra oh my I could
[03:18:56] I could put Kaya on Nobles
[03:18:59] no I don't want to I could sing show on
[03:19:02] the bless
[03:19:05] I'll just put fires on VV whatever I
[03:19:08] mean scarra could be on VV it's not even
[03:19:10] bad
[03:19:15] it's probably optimal like technically
[03:19:16] it's probably optimal
[03:19:23] it just makes him look worse like it's
[03:19:25] probably optimal team-wise but it
[03:19:27] definitely makes him look worse
[03:19:29] why is him over Hazel then because he's
[03:19:31] flying
[03:19:32] laughs
[03:19:39] okay fine we'll just write Essen farazan
[03:19:41] will be relatable for the non-c6 Parsons
[03:20:03] oh yeah that's true too
[03:20:05] militarism gives us 20 attack so if we
[03:20:08] if we VV scarra we're getting 15 enemo
[03:20:12] damage and 20 attack which is actually
[03:20:14] not bad
[03:20:16] it's still not bad like that's like
[03:20:18] close
[03:20:26] [ __ ] okay I'm caving
[03:20:35] bucket I caved
[03:20:48] if it's useful I'll take it
[03:20:52] if it's if it's useful I'll take it
[03:20:57] wait where's my sand where's my Sandy
[03:21:00] Sandy boom and then we do we can keep
[03:21:04] this goblet on him
[03:21:06] Loki just taking our Hazel pieces it's
[03:21:07] all good
[03:21:09] 72
[03:21:11] Whitson
[03:21:33] all right let's go

[03:22:57] that in my skin a skill
[03:23:03] sorry I thought let him die
[03:23:07] I was trying to time it I was trying to
[03:23:09] time it
[03:23:12] and guess who [ __ ] up the timing me
[03:23:23] [ __ ] I wasted a dash
[03:23:30] spell your head
[03:23:37] I like my birds lasted longer gaia's
[03:23:40] Birds lasted longer than the cooldown
[03:23:42] because that's what the [ __ ] C2
[03:23:54] rain outlined your face
[03:24:01] assistant
[03:24:02] when Rising
[03:24:17] um
[03:24:19] people wagon
[03:24:21] underrated emote
[03:24:27] that was good team looks fun yeah I mean
[03:24:30] it's basically the same as the Hazel one
[03:24:31] they're both really fun
[03:24:33] battle time
[03:24:35] why did I do that I don't know I'm sorry
[03:24:37] I I just wanted to like Jump Around
[03:24:41] what's that on skara in that team for
[03:24:42] this inventor you can also put on farzan
[03:24:44] especially if she's not C6 but since
[03:24:46] we're C6 I figured we militarizon
[03:24:50] and Vanessa's Cara
[03:24:54] use farazan e no [ __ ] farazan e
[03:24:59] but yeah okay ready yeah I'm ready okay

[03:25:31] I'm actually not gonna sign up here
[03:25:33] we're just gonna [ __ ] beta Beto carry

[03:34:53] easy compared to the last one it's like
[03:34:55] five times easier probably six times
[03:34:57] seven times
[03:35:00] all right cool let me say that too just
[03:35:02] in case
[03:35:04] uh what was that that was Sino and Scara
[03:35:08] scaramuki zero this
[03:35:13] all right cool
[03:35:15] all right it's time to farm artifacts
[03:35:19] wow I love artifacts okay I need to kill
[03:35:22] 25 to 2600 Rune graders so in the
[03:35:25] Vermilion I can't cheat so we're gonna
[03:35:26] have to do some Vermillion but I also
[03:35:28] should Farm emblem I mean uh gilded and
[03:35:30] emblem
[03:35:32] like Vermillion is definitely a waste
[03:35:33] but if I want to be able to make the
[03:35:35] video I at least need 2500 Rune graders
[03:35:37] so I at least have to do a little bit
[03:35:39] more just to like be accurate with our
[03:35:41] estimations you know like if I spend 90
[03:35:44] 000 99 000 resin it's not as impressive
[03:35:46] as I spend the whole hundred thousand so
[03:35:49] we can't you can't go the distance and
[03:35:52] then the last mile you give up like let
[03:35:54] this be a lesson you know it's like you
[03:35:56] can't do 99 of it and then the last
[03:35:59] percent you're like man I give up like
[03:36:01] no you have to you you you you you have
[03:36:04] to finish it
[03:36:17] okay we need a friendship team we'll do
[03:36:21] Kirara and bite you are in French of 10
[03:36:22] so we're definitely gonna play them
[03:36:27] I could just play nilu only two
[03:36:29] friendship characters but all good
[03:36:47] imagine you get a 50 crit value Echoes
[03:36:49] can't wait you will be banned actually
[03:36:51] I'm fine that's good because then I can
[03:36:53] be even rank one or ayato
[03:36:56] why settle for rank one when you could
[03:36:58] be more than rank one emergency
[03:37:25] maybe we'll meow a good artifact
[03:37:34] okay that could be good that could also
[03:37:37] be good
[03:37:39] why did someone type dendro is an
[03:37:41] element
[03:37:42] first message
[03:37:48] yes dendro's an element
[03:37:54] by acting like I don't know
[03:38:05] remember Bloom is a reaction
[03:38:10] oh I [ __ ] I meant to hold the whatever
[03:38:14] [Music]
[03:38:17] to swallow
[03:38:30] to really maximize our meows per second
[03:38:32] there
[03:38:35] our meow per minute mpm
[03:38:42] unlucky could be good
[03:38:45] foreign
[03:38:54] [Music]
[03:39:01] what a second half again there's the oh
[03:39:03] yeah it's [ __ ] bad against assignment
[03:39:05] you probably don't want to play neither
[03:39:06] against the Simon but you could just
[03:39:07] yell on brute force it probably like it
[03:39:10] probably still works
[03:39:12] but I wouldn't
[03:39:22] for the better yeah
[03:39:31] what what
[03:39:33] were her meows getting canceled do you
[03:39:35] hear that they're like getting muted
[03:39:38] halfway
[03:39:40] what the [ __ ]
[03:39:44] how do you cancel meows what if I should
[03:39:46] include that my guide did I miss
[03:39:48] something
[03:39:49] unlucky
[03:39:52] that is especially terrible
[03:39:59] maybe she tried to climb the Rune grader
[03:40:03] foreign
[03:40:06] off
[03:40:09] is that yeah yeah friendship oh yeah she
[03:40:11] is
[03:40:13] can you show your nulu
[03:40:15] sure
[03:40:16] 62.5 K HP two piece two piece wow
[03:40:19] amazing wow amazing Sans goblet Circle
[03:40:23] it doesn't really matter flat HP is not
[03:40:25] needed on those I mean obviously like
[03:40:27] these top stats don't help her but it is
[03:40:28] what it is I that sounds better
[03:40:30] technically
[03:40:31] that's what it is
[03:40:35] double blade
[03:40:45] what reaction is
[03:40:47] a windy plant that's what the reaction
[03:40:49] is called
[03:40:52] it does absolutely nothing but it's cool
[03:40:54] no it's not but it's windy and it's
[03:40:56] planty
[03:41:11] before this day comes out oh we missed
[03:41:12] it original accounts in the prime
[03:41:15] there's artifacts for this artifacts for
[03:41:17] you
[03:41:19] this sort of
[03:41:21] this could be good do you want a martial
[03:41:23] artist
[03:41:30] what is this 2010 beat it's a musical
[03:41:32] Journey what do you expect

[03:41:51] or next stream I guess
[03:41:53] maybe today but we'll see we stopped we
[03:41:55] have to uncap our resin at least to like

[03:42:15] right over here yeah watch this is gonna
[03:42:18] be crit rate with a crit damage and the
[03:42:20] attack sense of that

[03:42:23] why can you command more pieces
[03:42:28] what
[03:42:29] attack not percent but still wait
[03:42:33] that's actually really big
[03:42:35] I mean we already have a good Circle but
[03:42:37] we don't have a good crit rate one so
[03:42:39] this could be for our Homa build could
[03:42:40] be good
[03:42:41] okay be good let's level it
[03:42:43] maybe just some
[03:42:46] with the five months commanded a good

[04:11:33] yeah I changed my title what do you guys
[04:11:35] think what do you guys think of my new
[04:11:36] title
[04:11:37] why is my silver wolf dead bro
[04:11:41] yo I Auto
[04:11:42] domain I
[04:11:44] don't the [ __ ] did she die wait whoa
[04:11:47] wait whoa wait whoa also my sounds are
[04:11:50] muted
[04:11:52] boy how did silver wolf die
[04:11:57] oh that's loud
[04:12:03] dying with lewish on the team dude it's
[04:12:05] Auto Battle maybe maybe yeah maybe it
[04:12:07] was time for it's time for a bug and
[04:12:09] then she died also I fully claimed my
[04:12:11] battle pass all stream yesterday and I
[04:12:13] had to choose a weapon I low-key panic I
[04:12:16] don't need any bro like I don't want any
[04:12:17] so I got the I wanted to get the one
[04:12:20] where it looks like they're kissing but
[04:12:21] it's kind of bad so I got this one
[04:12:23] because I might use it on someone
[04:12:25] that's great right you know and debuff I
[04:12:27] mean above the spell
[04:12:29] but yeah I guess I could oh I could have
[04:12:31] just superimposed this one but I'm
[04:12:33] [ __ ] stupid that's fine I mean I like
[04:12:35] it
[04:12:36] but I forgot you could superimpose oops
[04:12:39] this is better though I'd rather not
[04:12:40] just stack one
[04:12:42] so yeah uh also I want to level another
[04:12:46] nahili light cone
[04:12:48] because I want to give this one to welt
[04:12:50] and then give this one to Silver Wolf so
[04:12:52] I kind of performed some traces
[04:12:57] okay
[04:12:58] yeah so we're actually ready we're
[04:13:01] actually ready you guys aren't you dude
[04:13:02] I actually performed so much but you can
[04:13:04] perform for Baldi
[04:13:06] because he's gonna need probably a new
[04:13:07] boss and probably the new [ __ ] Relic
[04:13:09] set and probably the new [ __ ]
[04:13:10] simulated Universe World expansion set
[04:13:13] dude yeah so it is GG but
[04:13:16] it's fine
[04:13:18] fourth Loop do this as long as I've
[04:13:19] anger though it's fine
[04:13:24] dude I'm our playlist is small
[04:13:28] doesn't matter for one a bit
[04:13:29] hey Pop Bob
[04:13:31] it was meant for one run what's Weighing
[04:13:33] on your mind wait why did I why did I
[04:13:36] ask her that or them
[04:13:38] foreign
[04:13:51] see I told you I was grinding off stream
[04:13:52] I told you
[04:14:04] what's the name of the song it's 60
[04:14:06] divided by 10 plus one
[04:14:08] Solve the Riddle to get the fiddle stay
[04:14:11] in the middle I listen to Temple was I
[04:14:13] mean you know it's free free Temple
[04:14:15] Kimiko please please please please
[04:14:17] there's no RGB
[04:14:22] are there even four stars I want I don't
[04:14:24] know I don't know like eidolons are cool
[04:14:26] but
[04:14:28] we'll see I guess
[04:14:30] there's might be one that I'm not
[04:14:31] thinking of
[04:14:35] wow shared feeling
[04:14:42] Marge is cool I like March
[04:14:54] um
[04:14:56] yeah shared feeling's kind of an arm but
[04:14:59] it is what it is oh I love all the new
[04:15:01] light cone so you know how when I was
[04:15:03] testing Lucha I used this icon because
[04:15:05] it's my by lose but I was like you know
[04:15:06] it's the only one I have leveled so now
[04:15:09] I level the new one which is perfect
[04:15:10] timing
[04:15:12] uh so now we have this one for Baidu and
[04:15:14] then this one we get to 80 for our Lucha
[04:15:17] kazuka heals too much already so I feel
[04:15:19] like you don't really like a factorize
[04:15:20] is nice
[04:15:21] so we don't get Frozen and [ __ ] but we
[04:15:23] don't actually need that much more
[04:15:24] healing so
[04:15:25] yeah
[04:15:28] uh dude I actually did so much free
[04:15:30] farming though like you guys actually
[04:15:31] don't understand
[04:15:35] uh okay it's not that much
[04:15:39] I figured I don't really want to run
[04:15:41] like I did some Relic farming off stream
[04:15:42] but most of it was just
[04:15:45] um like I did a [ __ ] ton of traces and
[04:15:47] [ __ ] so you could look at butt of
[04:15:50] Destruction boom 190. boom 148 boom
[04:15:53] [ __ ] 27 purple
[04:15:55] so we're actually like Loki said on that
[04:15:58] butt of the hunt I have some but who
[04:16:00] cares uh abundance I have enough for uh
[04:16:02] I want to level a like on to 80. so I
[04:16:04] like have just about enough Harmony I
[04:16:06] got some too but I I leveled a lot of
[04:16:08] characters and then the Hillary I have
[04:16:10] enough for a like on as well or not
[04:16:12] really enough but like almost enough so
[04:16:14] so yeah
[04:16:16] um
[04:16:19] uh wait where is it what did I wanna
[04:16:22] oh yeah look at this I literally finally
[04:16:24] got I finally unlocked this which is
[04:16:26] broken I finally unlocked
[04:16:28] uh I guess I can unlock this
[04:16:31] it's [ __ ] three percent
[04:16:33] no not yet I unlocked that I unlocked uh
[04:16:36] Ting yoon's one yeah I locked this one I
[04:16:39] also unlocked welts my wealth is kind of
[04:16:40] neglected
[04:16:41] but I unlocked this finally
[04:16:44] I didn't lock this one yet though
[04:16:45] because you have to send them I'm
[04:16:47] actually gonna start investing in welt
[04:16:48] more because I want to use them
[04:16:50] um
[04:16:58] wait what the [ __ ] I could level her
[04:17:15] wait this doesn't even cost a thing okay
[04:17:17] we might as well
[04:17:25] wait low key this is the material I
[04:17:27] don't want to use so if I level this one
[04:17:29] I I don't even use the like the normal
[04:17:31] enemy mats because I'm too lazy to farm
[04:17:33] them so this one's actually like easier
[04:17:34] to level even if it uses this
[04:17:41] yanching
[04:17:42] oh well I need to level answering more
[04:17:57] how much is this
[04:18:03] okay
[04:18:06] do an exp farming route yeah surely I'll
[04:18:09] do that surely I'll do that
[04:18:12] I can level this later all right we're
[04:18:14] chilling for now but yeah so I found a
[04:18:16] lot of [ __ ] I also did dude I did like a
[04:18:18] stupid amount of credits
[04:18:21] um
[04:18:23] oh yeah I missed last event but I I
[04:18:25] still have this one to do but I did like
[04:18:26] a like I legit I got 3.8 million credits
[04:18:30] when have you seen me with credits or
[04:18:32] Mora or currency in any game I actually
[04:18:35] just would like well I had nothing to do
[04:18:37] I'll just log in Auto Battle this and
[04:18:38] log out that's not dude you're saying oh
[04:18:40] that's it but I literally spent all of
[04:18:43] my credits last stream on luocha and all
[04:18:45] of his traces and all of his like light
[04:18:46] cone and [ __ ] yukong and all that
[04:18:49] [ __ ] so I had none
[04:18:50] 3.8 is pretty good
[04:18:55] so yeah we're actually like pretty
[04:18:57] stocked right now we just need to like
[04:18:58] like my genus still a one-to-one ratio
[04:19:01] so genuine needs some work but everyone
[04:19:04] else we're pretty cracked right now
[04:19:05] we're pretty cracked
[04:19:07] um I did a lot of Relic farming I did no
[04:19:11] I did
[04:19:12] I did a lot of Relic farming oh also I
[04:19:14] have 45 of these for welt and these for
[04:19:17] future characters
[04:19:18] um maybe who knows how would I know I
[04:19:20] don't know I don't know I don't know
[04:19:21] anything what am I saying words okay but
[04:19:23] relics uh we actually have dude look at
[04:19:25] all these locked ones like I actually
[04:19:27] got a lot that are like potential but I
[04:19:29] didn't level them off stream you know
[04:19:31] you might be like oh these are copium
[04:19:32] okay what about what about um um on this
[04:19:34] one okay it could be good for Yan Ching
[04:19:36] uh uh what about this one speed crit
[04:19:39] damage attack percent yanching doesn't
[04:19:40] need anything else
[04:19:44] I actually have so many relics that I
[04:19:46] don't remember like look at how many
[04:19:47] relics I have
[04:19:48] I don't like I low-key forget about them
[04:19:50] this one could be really good
[04:19:52] this one is pretty good
[04:19:54] wait no this one never mind it's defense
[04:19:56] I got a better one I thought
[04:19:58] this could be good for blade
[04:20:08] but yeah anyways I I tried to farm this
[04:20:10] Quantum set a bit more Loki was not
[04:20:12] paying off I still have no good [ __ ]
[04:20:15] Quantum pieces but you know it is what
[04:20:17] it is as the kids say
[04:20:19] it definitely is what it is
[04:20:22] um
[04:20:24] it is what it is wait I only have a
[04:20:26] four-star one
[04:20:28] wait surely a [ __ ] five star one's
[04:20:29] better
[04:20:31] surely I just level this one
[04:20:35] surely there's like no way this could be
[04:20:37] worse right
[04:20:43] I mean it's still better because of the
[04:20:45] main stat right it's still better
[04:20:46] because of the main stat
[04:20:49] it's still better because of the main
[04:20:50] stats but [ __ ] is that bad
[04:20:53] [ __ ] that's like a waste of XP
[04:20:58] it's still better though it's still
[04:21:00] better and then this I could just use on
[04:21:01] like Pila or some [ __ ] I don't know
[04:21:03] pillow doesn't want
[04:21:26] oh we got an attack roll
[04:21:28] it's better though marker damage is
[04:21:30] better because you already have so much
[04:21:31] critic on him almost 200 not bad
[04:21:34] not too shabby
[04:21:37] but yeah like we're we could basically
[04:21:39] folk their memory chaos the only thing
[04:21:40] stopping us is our third DPS because our
[04:21:42] Sealy is really good and our yanching is
[04:21:44] really good but sometimes we need to go
[04:21:45] Jin Yuan energy is not that good it's
[04:21:47] not his fault it's not it's just we
[04:21:49] don't have the best like look at this
[04:21:52] the [ __ ] is this what is this
[04:21:56] so yeah Argent is like very copium his
[04:21:59] ring is pretty good
[04:22:01] his flower is pretty decent but the rest
[04:22:04] is so bad like it actually hurts to play
[04:22:06] him so we need to get better sets on him
[04:22:08] uh artifact's not relics on him or we
[04:22:11] get Blade and then blade carry but yeah
[04:22:13] so that's the plan
[04:22:15] um so we're gonna go do uh
[04:22:19] uh memor
[04:22:22] simulated universe
[04:22:25] hey haha blade can you simulate my
[04:22:28] universe I didn't say that we're gonna
[04:22:29] go to simulate Universe wait I have
[04:22:31] doubled
[04:22:33] I'll do this off stream sure that I
[04:22:35] won't forget surely socks won't forget
[04:22:36] I'll do one have to go pee I'll just
[04:22:38] Auto Battle it I actually have to pee
[04:22:39] right now okay I'll Auto Battle this and
[04:22:40] I'll go to say the universe uh what do I
[04:22:42] need Chad do I need more than this 148
[04:22:44] 190
[04:22:47] and 27. let's not wanna level eight
[04:22:49] trace's blade and get his icon to 90 or
[04:22:52] 80.
[04:22:54] should I do I actually need more
[04:22:56] surely this is fine right because I can
[04:22:58] convert these to purple
[04:23:04] like I can convert them I'm not gonna
[04:23:06] keep this green
[04:23:14] get more
[04:23:16] okay the only thing is I don't like the
[04:23:18] other like I'm not gonna play any other
[04:23:20] destruction character
[04:23:23] so the only problem is like if I get too
[04:23:26] many these are useless because I don't
[04:23:28] play [ __ ] hook I don't play Arlen I
[04:23:31] don't have Clara I mean I guess if I get
[04:23:33] chloride user but I don't have her
[04:23:39] oh do we know Dan Hong's path Oh I
[04:23:42] thought he was oh okay true
[04:23:45] all right BRB I have to pee let me just
[04:23:46] all about this I'll be like a minute

[04:30:03] dude being able to do all this [ __ ] in
[04:30:04] the menu in this game is so [ __ ] nice
[04:30:07] like gearing doesn't feel as painful
[04:30:09] because I don't have to like leave 17
[04:30:10] menus just to do anything
[04:30:13] but for some reason you can't hold click

[04:36:51] dude we used to back it like two years
[04:36:53] ago we used to do every domain without
[04:36:55] condensed resin because there's nothing
[04:36:56] else to do so we would just not Farm the
[04:36:58] butterflies and spend 20 at a time when
[04:37:00] canance first came out that was like as
[04:37:02] soon as Cadets came out for like a few

[05:21:34] little bro ain't getting all three [ __ ]
[05:21:36] you I'm about to watch
[05:21:41] we break this guy
[05:21:44] always a
[05:21:47] weaknesses then we do
[05:21:52] but he's about to leave yeah there's no
[05:21:54] way we get this
[05:21:58] is what a coward would say disappeared
[05:22:05] oh your silly sucks [ __ ] you winnable oh
[05:22:08] viral points
[05:22:10] it's fine it's still winnable wait we
[05:22:12] actually break it okay did you win
[05:22:16] okay well I guess I'm just going
[05:22:18] infinite turns silly moment time for a
[05:22:21] bug
[05:22:24] wait who did I just
[05:22:29] why did bronya choose herself
[05:22:34] why did Brian choose herself it's fine
[05:22:37] we win we got three easy that's actually
[05:22:39] [ __ ] huge
[05:22:41] oh this is really good
[05:22:44] yes that's good
[05:22:49] I really want to spend money but
[05:22:54] I really do not want to spend money here
[05:22:57] oh wanna character that could be good
[05:23:01] for Kafka that could actually be good we
[05:23:02] might need it if we like you know get
[05:23:04] [ __ ] a little
[05:23:06] oh
[05:23:12] how much money do we have
[05:23:15] 700 so our robe is stacked seven times
[05:23:17] are any of these Buffs better than a
[05:23:19] robe
[05:23:21] oh let me respond to something really
[05:23:22] fast
[05:23:25] maybe this could there's a case to be
[05:23:27] made for weakness break efficiency
[05:23:50] uh yeah this one is yeah I know this one
[05:23:52] is actually broken I agree that's what I
[05:23:54] was like thinking of upgrading but I'm
[05:23:55] trying to see yeah yeah I don't see a
[05:23:57] world where I don't upgrade it it's just
[05:23:59] now our money's awkward like 589 is
[05:24:01] really weird so we can level a five star
[05:24:02] one and only lose one instead of two
[05:24:08] this one is
[05:24:10] uh it doesn't happen that often but it
[05:24:12] is a big chunk of no no it's not it's
[05:24:14] not more than robe
[05:24:16] we have a lot of damage percent uh yeah
[05:24:18] she does the talk a lot so we lose crit
[05:24:20] boost
[05:24:28] this attack boost is not bad
[05:24:31] that's not worth
[05:24:34] skill point is nice
[05:24:45] so here's the thing save it we could
[05:24:47] save but we get
[05:24:49] we're like at an uneven number so if we
[05:24:52] if we upgrade a gold it only costs one
[05:24:55] robe pick
[05:25:11] nah nah they kind of suck
[05:25:14] all right whatever
[05:25:16] that effect hit rate one Castle are the
[05:25:19] The Shield break costs a lot hey Kafka
[05:25:21] hey hey Kafka
[05:25:28] wait why are we taller than her
[05:25:30] holy Shad what the [ __ ]
[05:25:35] hey Kafka
[05:25:37] ah hi hi Kafka
[05:25:42] why do we have to fight why can't I just
[05:25:44] join you [ __ ] it
[05:25:47] if you're evil then what what is it what

[05:33:22] ayato build uh uh uh ranking doesn't
[05:33:24] count because I don't actually have Miss
