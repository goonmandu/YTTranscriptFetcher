[01:04:18] beon I'm not talking about any specific
[01:04:20] character I was just I was jumbling up I
[01:04:21] saw like eight characters with the same
[01:04:23] usage rate above them I was like dude
[01:04:24] they're literally all
[01:04:32] mid if I wanted a mid five star I'd play
[01:04:35] y dude there is no way you're doing this
[01:04:37] comparison there is no way you're doing
[01:04:38] this comparison there is literally no
[01:04:40] way you're doing this comparison right
[01:04:41] now there is no way you're doing this
[01:04:42] compar Shia can hit everyone around him
[01:04:45] immense amounts of damage scaling on
[01:04:47] your
[01:04:50] investment sorry no that's too broken
[01:04:52] though your journey also broken dude
[01:04:55] they literally
[01:04:56] okay dude they're literally releasing
[01:04:58] DPSS that legit are like becoming
[01:05:01] similar to PO value supports they not
[01:05:03] really good I mean neet
[01:05:09] is the dude he's not he's literally just
[01:05:12] you can yeah you literally can't go
[01:05:14] wrong don't you like don't think just
[01:05:16] balls and then click okay okay okay okay
[01:05:19] rate this take rate this take I think
[01:05:21] net might be the only okay
[01:05:25] the way I rank let's say I make a tier
[01:05:26] this hypothetically okay supports would
[01:05:28] be like usually a tier higher than DPS
[01:05:29] is I think nevet might be the only one
[01:05:30] in that tier I think you maybe Shang
[01:05:32] Ling you have to make like two tier list
[01:05:35] One support one like DPS yeah okay let's
[01:05:37] say we're doing pull value I think nevet
[01:05:39] is literally on the same tier as some
[01:05:40] supports not like he's not like better
[01:05:42] than a lot of supports but like similar
[01:05:44] I'm not even kidding I think Al's also
[01:05:46] really high but he's still a
[01:05:48] DPS officials a DPS okay true no ruin

[01:24:08] known to like
[01:24:10] kokomi I think we do this and then
[01:24:12] second half we do either net or alyam I
[01:24:16] think we're going to play Alam cuz I
[01:24:17] haven't played him in a while Alam Nita
[01:24:19] yelling and cookie I think this pretty
[01:24:22] good is there any way we can get on
[01:24:23] shotted so that Believers lose I don't
[01:24:25] really think so oh
[01:24:27] [ __ ] we're dead we're dead if we
[01:24:29] fight capellia without a shield we're
[01:24:31] dead just so you guys know we're dead um
[01:24:33] I might have to run NE nevet would make
[01:24:36] it easier but I'm down not to um Ki

[01:24:43] sad
[01:24:45] face listen here bud we don't have

[01:24:51] let's say there's Abyss 54 and we can
[01:24:53] play three different teams at once Soo
[01:24:55] might be on one of them no he probably
[01:24:57] wouldn't cuz Al them Shia never let
[01:24:59] that's
[01:25:01] three okay on a real note though like
[01:25:03] when do you use a like I don't
[01:25:07] know I've been stop talking about aboba
[01:25:10] I've been genuinely thinking about like
[01:25:12] what is the situation you use aboba we
[01:25:14] don't use aboba S s's good for
[01:25:21] resistance so
[01:25:22] stop aboba I like genuinely
[01:25:27] curious how would you describe an aboba
[01:25:32] situation
[01:25:34] situation wait chat um is finina enough
[01:25:38] Hydro for these two alone with no other
[01:25:41] Hydro character cuz I don't know I kind
[01:25:44] of want to oh [ __ ] do I have to run sha
[01:25:48] why do they make Professor why do they
[01:25:50] make Shia in the the recent like five of
[01:25:53] this is not usable cuz every enemy needs
[01:25:55] [ __ ] eight elements or high anemo
[01:25:58] reses to make the character that is a
[01:25:59] broke a really strong DPS by the way
[01:26:02] look bad it's enough I don't know okay a
[01:26:05] doubter just said it's
[01:26:08] enough Wahoo we could just
[01:26:13] Chow finina Bennett and then kakomi and
[01:26:17] I just use Ki to break
[01:26:20] it I think that's fine and then second
[01:26:23] half we do let me just make sure she's

[01:38:31] watch I Didn't Do The Abyss yet and I
[01:38:32] can tell you how to do this you want to
[01:38:33] pop one towards the other so they group
[01:38:35] together watch this so I'm going to
[01:38:37] attack this guy this way and he's going
[01:38:38] to pop towards his friend watch
[01:38:41] watch [ __ ] I kind of [ __ ] it up but
[01:38:43] it's fine Dodge that attack I have no
[01:38:44] stamina Dodge Dodge oh oh I got it wait
[01:38:47] that's literally the first time I DOD
[01:38:48] attack in my life no never mind I do
[01:38:49] that every day actually
[01:38:52] ey frame oh my wait I'm actually playing
[01:38:54] well why do I sound
[01:38:59] surprised I wish I grouped them better
[01:39:01] though in my defense in my offense I
[01:39:02] should have grouped them better so
[01:39:03] that's my bad but other than that pretty
[01:39:07] good cack separate ICD yeah we [ __ ] up
[01:39:11] the grouping our hydra's lowkey not
[01:39:18] enough have fun with this
[01:39:26] dude there's no Hydro being
[01:39:34] applied I don't
[01:39:37] know maybe okay so in hindsight now that
[01:39:40] I actually did the floor once if that
[01:39:42] was me again I would have grouped them
[01:39:43] better I said how to do it I didn't do
[01:39:45] it perfectly but I would have grouped
[01:39:46] them better and then maybe ran more
[01:39:47] Hydro than that all good um what is oh
[01:39:51] we have to kill the [ __ ] durge of
[01:39:52] capus but net and finina are so broken
[01:39:54] that I think we can clear this in like 5
[01:39:56] seconds I'm not kidding by the way these
[01:39:57] guys are so broken I think we can if I
[01:39:59] was playing a fourar team which I'm
[01:40:00] going to do next maybe we wouldn't but I
[01:40:02] think this was going be too easy thanks

[01:40:09] tried and I told you how to group them

[02:11:39] they're happy all right okay uh what
[02:11:41] we're going to do today is that we're
[02:11:43] going to rank them um um um so it's
[02:11:45] every five star and the only four star
[02:11:47] the animation is Barbara
[02:11:53] not bad raise that out of
[02:11:56] time okay so um I found a random video
[02:12:00] called all five star birth animations
[02:12:01] this ends at De though like there's like
[02:12:03] de is like the last character I'll H
[02:12:04] them so after that we'll all use my
[02:12:06] characters in game for the new font 10
[02:12:07] ones F uh finina is out by the time I'm
[02:12:10] recording this so she'll be in the video
[02:12:12] uh so we'll have to do some ourselves
[02:12:13] but for now we'll do this uh uh shout
[02:12:14] out to this guy VK so yeah cool like the
[02:12:17] video um yeah so we're going to watch
[02:12:19] animations and we're going to rate them
[02:12:20] on a tier list
[02:12:24] agree agree are you guys ready I'm not
[02:12:27] going to be the only one talking here so
[02:12:28] I'm just I'll shut up in a second I
[02:12:30] promise okay we're going to start with
[02:12:31] Jean so definitely some clear bias in
[02:12:33] the room with us right now what are you
[02:12:35] what are you talking about are we rating
[02:12:37] it out of like 10 we're rating it out of
[02:12:39] we're rating on a tier list we could
[02:12:41] rate out of 10 if you want but we're
[02:12:42] gonna put it let me put the mic closer
[02:12:44] to you guys is it by letter or number
[02:12:47] it's gonna be do I sound scuff chat wait
[02:12:49] wait how's the audio what the do I sound
[02:12:52] okay can you guys hear them all
[02:12:57] no does the VA included for rating no it
[02:13:01] we're including the animation how it
[02:13:02] makes us feel how we like it what it
[02:13:04] looks like it doesn't matter about the
[02:13:06] damage we don't care about like the
[02:13:07] other stuff yeah all right Press Start
[02:13:11] all right let's go we're start g pack
[02:13:13] jeene her burst is called dandelion
[02:13:15] Breeze I know
[02:13:16] it wind hear me oh my God it's lagging
[02:13:21] what the whoa whoa whoa I may have shout
[02:13:23] out shout this guy out too
[02:13:26] fast wind hear me oh it just me lagging
[02:13:29] sorry dude not your fault let's run it
[02:13:30] back one more time let's actually start
[02:13:31] Okay g yeah it's going to
[02:13:36] be you guys have to say anything cuz
[02:13:38] like we're we're thinking the same thing
[02:13:39] so
[02:13:42] like retribution why can't I pause the
[02:13:45] video oh sorry sorry sorry wait you
[02:13:48] think Gan is pop tier dude literally all
[02:13:50] okay you can love Jean but like
[02:13:52] respectfully all she does is I could do
[02:13:54] Jean's BL
[02:13:56] SW I think my metric for a burst ranking
[02:13:59] is if I can mimic it then it's not s
[02:14:01] tier do you look like that
[02:14:04] though I don't think so yo okay okay but
[02:14:06] we're talking about the animation if a
[02:14:08] character let's say let's say yeah junk
[02:14:10] Cooks on screen okay and he does a burst
[02:14:13] it's not automatically an S cuz he looks
[02:14:14] like that it's automatically an S no no
[02:14:16] no no we're talking about the animation
[02:14:18] but she's the only one with that
[02:14:20] animation me okay but I'm saying this
[02:14:23] anim why is it lagging by the way um

[02:20:29] okay okay listen here's my take with
[02:20:32] theuk everyone the Luke's really old by
[02:20:34] now feeling like oh it's was is mid this
[02:20:36] is lowy one of the reason I started
[02:20:37] playing gin like there's sh official but
[02:20:39] also duuke I think it just looked cool I
[02:20:40] was like
[02:20:42] tribution now it's kind of like stale
[02:20:44] but I think it's sick I used to use this
[02:20:46] to kill Tim's Birds for
[02:20:48] f you know on the bridge I think the
[02:20:51] Luke's pretty cool what do you guys
[02:20:52] think I think like B for me like at
[02:20:56] least B maybe a I think with his skin
[02:20:58] easy a cuz the like changes colors cool
[02:21:01] sounds effects b b like a C+ damn okay
[02:21:07] I'll be it then I'll be it okay okay be
[02:21:08] is respectful I think what the skin is
[02:21:09] say but okay C+ be I mean editor you
[02:21:12] just write the ranks agree agree unpaid
[02:21:15] editor no you're getting paid I promise

[02:22:20] nice it's so sparkly all like it I like
[02:22:23] that you have different opinions on us
[02:22:24] cuz then the like let's say I'm like
[02:22:25] saying something bad about burst
[02:22:26] animation then the CLE are on your side
[02:22:28] and then they like the video
[02:22:30] anyways okay cool yeah I mean I think
[02:22:32] it's that's [ __ ] smart I think I mean
[02:22:35] no disrespect to Cle I just think all
[02:22:37] she does is blue I Just sh everyone I
[02:22:39] was so biased for the satire but no one
[02:22:42] got it I just got [ __ ]
[02:22:45] on literally
[02:22:47] wait Chad how's the sound of the video
[02:22:48] is it too loud I can turn down if it
[02:22:50] [ __ ] with you guys is it too loud I
[02:22:51] took it so literally oh my
[02:22:55] God move her up
[02:23:01] Bozo next one dud why is this guy oh I
[02:23:04] mean the burst does also shoot after
[02:23:06] where the [ __ ] is that like what domain
[02:23:07] is this this an event decided by Destiny
[02:23:10] all all right all right all sorry that
[02:23:13] was weird why did I pause there cuz I
[02:23:15] zooming into her face
[02:23:17] decided and then oh what color are her
[02:23:21] eyes blue blue light blue oh a for oh a
[02:23:27] for no cuz have you guys seen like the
[02:23:30] range of each character what I like the
[02:23:34] like the range of all her M has one
[02:23:41] of biggest what range over for
[02:23:45] what give it a okay someone the audio
[02:23:54] [Laughter]
[02:23:57] is that's so true that's so true that's
[02:24:02] so
[02:24:03] true okay breathe okay okay okay okay I
[02:24:08] think let me let okay I didn't really
[02:24:09] say much yet that's a cool word by the
[02:24:11] way I think the burst what I like
[02:24:13] especially about it is this part where
[02:24:14] the enemies are like floating in a
[02:24:15] bubble which is part of the burst oh
[02:24:17] [ __ ] I thought we're talking about the
[02:24:18] animation yeah but it's like part of the
[02:24:20] burst animation itself is just like
[02:24:23] which is okay I think it's okay I did
[02:24:27] not can you read this Jake you're so
[02:24:30] racist you're literally is this not so
[02:24:33] wait do you know do people know what
[02:24:34] ethnicity are cancel am my dog sing it

[02:24:39] aren't you yet yeah is this not yet it
[02:24:41] is how's that
[02:24:44] racist is not racist
[02:24:50] I have broad
[02:24:52] Edge s SS

[02:25:15] a
[02:25:17] a a s ass mine s then really I think a I
[02:25:21] don't think it's s to make
[02:25:23] itell oh I think it's cuz like it's not
[02:25:27] like overly like wow this is the best
[02:25:29] it's just cool it's pretty cool I
[02:25:31] personally don't like it cuz it takes 18
[02:25:33] seconds out of my rotation and then I
[02:25:34] have to use Mona's Dash afterwards dog
[02:25:35] for 1.0 burst that's a nice it is it is
[02:25:38] cool oh it is it is nice and then you
[02:25:40] get to look and then it adjust the angle
[02:25:41] for you sorry I got to stop being weird
[02:25:43] in this video I'm not like this I
[02:25:44] promise okay Mona a tier uh bur let's

[02:26:00] power s shut up S I didn't even see it
[02:26:03] yet that was amazing that was actually
[02:26:06] yeah that good look that's not part of
[02:26:09] the animation
[02:26:11] Gio okay I mean okay this is going to go
[02:26:15] in the two bias to vote tier for you but
[02:26:17] I think albo again if I can do the burst
[02:26:19] animation it's mid let's see if I can do
[02:26:23] it moment of this is
[02:26:27] okay bro that

[02:26:31] mean I like the explosion
[02:26:34] after his sword evaporates let's look
[02:26:37] let me look at it a let me look at it
[02:26:40] moment of bir yeah I think it's
[02:26:44] decent I think it's decent uh
[02:26:48] Vengeance will be
[02:26:54] mine okay all right I think it's decent
[02:26:58] um I think it's decent I I I like it it
[02:27:01] there some cool St to subtities to it
[02:27:04] but I'm not like the biggest fan I would
[02:27:05] say b or like no bias I'd say B but I
[02:27:06] know everyone in chat's like oh my God
[02:27:08] it's a but I think it's like B let me
[02:27:10] remove you that that's a joke
[02:27:12] okay what do you what do you
[02:27:15] think
[02:27:18] s SS s bro dude Chad is actually pissed

[02:27:39] sad inside I personally really like
[02:27:42] deluke Phoenix and I put deluke in Beast
[02:27:43] I don't think it's necessarily better
[02:27:44] than deluk Phoenix personally
[02:27:48] okay moment of
[02:27:54] birth a
[02:27:57] YULA Vengeance will be mine yes it will
[02:28:01] yes it will you play it in
[02:28:05] half and pause why not it went too fast
[02:28:09] it went too fast she like really fast
[02:28:11] yeah no half half that's that's
[02:28:15] Point bro

[02:28:27] mine no okay
[02:28:36] 45 you guys are so weird bro okay I
[02:28:40] don't know I don't know uh I think I
[02:28:42] think I think I
[02:28:45] think
[02:28:47] Fang listen respectfully I've heard you
[02:28:49] s for YULA before that's one two you've
[02:28:51] literally cosplayed YULA that's two I
[02:28:54] love her yeah this animation doesn't how
[02:28:55] to do her
[02:28:56] justice you know who you look
[02:29:00] like this could go so many anyways I
[02:29:03] don't want people say look like John
[02:29:04] Cook you look like Beyonce oh my
[02:29:07] God thank you that I will take that as a
[02:29:10] biggest compliment ever you ever see
[02:29:12] that me that's an old Vibe oh yeah it is
[02:29:14] old that me okay chat I I think
[02:29:17] YULA is like visually stunning with that
[02:29:21] said the animation she just Twirls could
[02:29:23] be better could be worse will be I'm
[02:29:25] kind of indifferent on it like that is
[02:29:26] cool but other than that it's kind of
[02:29:27] whatever to see um I think her normal
[02:29:30] attack animations of her dancing are
[02:29:31] actually better than her burst animation
[02:29:33] personally I'm I'm yeah I was going to
[02:29:37] put her in a be but didn't know you guys
[02:29:38] were seeing
[02:29:41] her whoa I would be it I don't think I'm
[02:29:45] you're next to Cle dude I really
[02:29:48] don't what the Yeah C+ tier C high C no
[02:29:53] but I it could be low B
[02:29:57] though like I think your normal attacks
[02:30:00] are higher ranks but people are going to
[02:30:01] skip to the end of the video Ula man oh
[02:30:03] my God I forgot what about the Ula main
[02:30:05] incident oh my God what does that mean
[02:30:07] dude when when Ula first released [ __ ]
[02:30:09] it it's been long enough and people were
[02:30:11] like comparing her to like a mid tier or
[02:30:13] like people weren't saying she's broken
[02:30:15] cuz of the clickbait videos doing a
[02:30:16] million Dage everyone was like sending
[02:30:17] death threats L like he you look so good
[02:30:20] I saw this one Tik tocker YouTuber do
[02:30:23] six [ __ ] you actually [ __ ] you Tik Tok
[02:30:26] is old no it's also YouTube too I'm not
[02:30:28] goingon to hey I'm might start a Tik Tok
[02:30:30] so
[02:30:31] don't no no I know there's a lot of
[02:30:33] people that on every yeah I saw some on
[02:30:35] YouTube too cuz people would clickbait
[02:30:37] like it wasn't even the YouTuber's fault
[02:30:38] or whatever Tik tocker's fault but they
[02:30:40] do like a showcas like a million damage
[02:30:41] with food and C6 sure that's fine but
[02:30:43] then the viewers like take that
[02:30:45] information and bring it to me when I
[02:30:46] compare her to like a I don't know like
[02:30:48] [ __ ] du like a duuk at the time or
[02:30:50] something and they're like oh she's so
[02:30:51] much better it's like dude dude dude
[02:30:52] dude dude dude dude sorry I don't know
[02:30:55] what we're talking about animation what
[02:30:57] what do we say I'm not going to vote on
[02:30:58] this one what do you say for you I'm
[02:31:01] hungry oh I give it
[02:31:06] a I
[02:31:08] give see hey he that's
[02:31:12] C+ C for crit true
[02:31:17] okay next
[02:31:18] one think you can get away I think
[02:31:21] that's sick if we are including the
[02:31:23] giant tornado which is part of his burst
[02:31:25] I think it's sick if we're not how do
[02:31:27] you rate animation do you include
[02:31:32] that my queen
[02:31:37] inate why are you guys only on the fifth
[02:31:39] character I'm okay okay I'm speeding up
[02:31:41] I'm speed up what do you think what do
[02:31:42] you
[02:31:44] think no no we have time we have time
[02:31:46] well literally dude what what do you
[02:31:48] think R what you think R I think at
[02:31:51] least an a I also think at least an a
[02:31:53] I'm lowkey down to S it but the him
[02:31:56] shooting him shooting the bow is not
[02:31:57] that
[02:31:58] big bro what the it's like shaking when
[02:32:01] he's like
[02:32:02] shooting think you can get I think this
[02:32:04] is kind of whatever but then the this is
[02:32:06] sick the hole makes it cooler yeah
[02:32:10] what I think this part is
[02:32:14] sick compared to the are archons no no
[02:32:17] no we're not comparing to the other
[02:32:18] archons now we're do them
[02:32:20] individually wouldn't gliding be faster
[02:32:23] inate I think especially for like a 1.0
[02:32:25] burst I think it's [ __ ] sick I'm
[02:32:27] going to be honest I think it's sick you
[02:32:29] can disagree but I disagree with your
[02:32:31] disagreement okay hey we're 130 out of
[02:32:35] seven I'm almost
[02:32:37] done be
[02:32:40] nauy dude what are we
[02:32:45] watching
[02:32:48] next up
[02:32:50] kaching
[02:32:52] I yeah okay I think that's like a
[02:32:55] classic s to be hon dude this I've seen
[02:32:57] this in other games since genin did it
[02:32:59] really are we comparing it to other
[02:33:01] games or no no I'm saying it's a trend
[02:33:02] Setter I'm saying King's burst I see it
[02:33:04] everywhere now it's pretty iconic like
[02:33:06] it's actually
[02:33:07] sick
[02:33:10] like I don't know if genin started the
[02:33:13] trend of those slices like maybe it was

[02:38:21] snake more but the fact that he pops the
[02:38:23] snake is here though just like chilling
[02:38:25] there's like mountains they could have
[02:38:27] done snake for sure yeah yeah I think
[02:38:30] they should play the snake game when you
[02:38:32] and then if you get a score of 10 you
[02:38:34] kill
[02:38:35] everything I think I mean I think it's
[02:38:37] cool I don't think it's s though a
[02:38:41] taking the turn
[02:38:43] what8 minutes you just want to leave
[02:38:45] dude
[02:38:50] low key this could be a be
[02:38:52] though yeah I kind of hyped it up and
[02:38:55] then I'm like I think it's be cuz I
[02:38:56] think they could have done more with
[02:38:57] like the snake can you please play a
[02:38:59] quick match of Among Us free

[02:42:20] is also shooting after his pretty Qui
[02:42:21] can you like keep going next oh I love
[02:42:23] child burst rip okay that one's kind of
[02:42:25] whatever the other one's cooler the
[02:42:26] other one's cooler also if you're using
[02:42:27] rust it looks disgusting oh this is
[02:42:29] going to hurt oh slice
[02:42:31] me sorry that was weird I think that one
[02:42:33] looks cool it's like a it's not like god
[02:42:35] tier but I think it's pretty cool that
[02:42:36] look like
[02:42:37] bar bro I'm not kidding bar this guy's
[02:42:41] mobile low Graphics though no disrespect
[02:42:45] but I'm just saying I think it's sick
[02:42:47] you don't like it are you hating on
[02:42:49] Vietnamese people bro
[02:42:52] what come on man why why
[02:42:58] you okay I think child's is C no I think
[02:43:03] it's s or a he has two different ones
[02:43:05] and the spin one is
[02:43:07] cool it's one
[02:43:11] slash like a c you what a c man yes okay
[02:43:15] child child th is already mad at me
[02:43:17] though cuz I made a joke about him dying
[02:43:19] in a quest and they're like actually
[02:43:21] it's not funny anymore
[02:43:24] sorry I personally put child a but where
[02:43:27] do you guys want to put them you guys
[02:43:28] think c c animation alone c as a
[02:43:31] character but the animation see just
[02:43:33] does one thing or two things okay can I
[02:43:35] put can we agree B I will say B maybe
[02:43:38] we're two different animation yes two
[02:43:40] animations but they're both basic
[02:43:42] they're both okay I also think I also
[02:43:44] think I think using his verst is very
[02:43:46] satisfying which might bias me because
[02:43:48] you vape like 200k yeah but if you don't
[02:43:50] see the number
