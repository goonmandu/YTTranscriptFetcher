[00:02:46] dog [ __ ] I don't usually do pre-release
[00:02:47] videos I only did it for yomia because
[00:02:50] she's in the trial so it's not
[00:02:52] speculation well some of it needs more
[00:02:54] testing but it's not like a guess it's
[00:02:58] like this is the Char
[00:03:01] character so like yeah you know yo Tito

[00:03:33] I'm Capp so I'm just going to do this
[00:03:34] very quickly just to just to relieve
[00:03:36] some stress uh and we're going to go do
[00:03:37] our daily commissions before they reset
[00:03:39] so uh yeah there's two right there how
[00:03:41] do I unlock this it's a puzzle right
[00:03:43] probably do
[00:03:45] that no this isn't my freet to playay
[00:03:46] account chat it's a joke I mean I guess
[00:03:48] you were kidding too but
[00:03:50] yeah that's I
[00:03:54] [Music]
[00:03:56] made you guys want to hear a secret my
[00:03:58] freeto playay count um well I bought a
[00:04:00] welon on it but you know my $5 account
[00:04:02] whatever you want to call it um it has
[00:04:04] 20
[00:04:06] and was it two I did two refreshes so is
[00:04:09] that like 280 or something am I at 220
[00:04:11] now yeah 280 it has resin and if you
[00:04:15] guys might be wondering why is your Free
[00:04:16] Play account on 220 resin well basically
[00:04:19] when aaka was coming
[00:04:21] out before the server reset I refreshed
[00:04:24] on my main no no no who was before AA
[00:04:26] whatever whoever was before AA I
[00:04:28] refreshed on my I wanted to refresh and
[00:04:29] and then log out while the the game
[00:04:31] patched okay but I logged in on Asia by
[00:04:33] accident and so I ended up refreshing on
[00:04:37] my free to-play account so I got I was
[00:04:40] like [ __ ] I just wasted 100 Primo Gems
[00:04:42] or 150 Primo gems um yeah and then I
[00:04:45] just logged off and never been on since
[00:04:47] so uh yeah
[00:04:52] cool Kaza yeah yeah cuz I was testing
[00:04:54] Kazo on an Asia account I'm probably
[00:04:57] going to play yoi on an Asia account too
[00:05:20] Chad you ever wish for a five star and
[00:05:22] then like ask ask yourself why did I
[00:05:24] spend Primo gems on that five star that
[00:05:26] happens to me very
[00:05:27] often actually no cuz I have to pull for
[00:05:30] everyone but it happens to me for for
[00:05:34] Cle I'm like why did I pull for
[00:05:40] Cle okay uh we're going to
[00:05:43] go here
[00:05:48] [Music]
[00:06:00] [Music]
[00:06:04] unlike people who pull for character
[00:06:06] pull for power instead of the character
[00:06:08] itself okay dude listen I don't pull for
[00:06:11] power I pull
[00:06:15] for I don't know I'm like okay I'm not a
[00:06:18] met okay guys I'm not a meta slave by
[00:06:21] choice I'm a meta slave by trade it's
[00:06:23] there's a difference okay like if you
[00:06:26] okay let's say there's a jeweler who
[00:06:29] okay guys guys hear me out hear me out
[00:06:32] let's say there's a jeweler who really
[00:06:34] enjoys uh uh copper okay he's not going
[00:06:38] to wear a copper watch to work okay even
[00:06:40] if he likes copper he's going to wear
[00:06:42] like a [ __ ] Rolex okay why because
[00:06:44] he's got a flex he's got to show that he
[00:06:46] knows what he's doing okay so if I'm
[00:06:48] using Chi-Chi instead of Bennett it
[00:06:50] shows a lack of understanding of the
[00:06:54] game so I'm a meta slave by force
[00:07:00] who enjoys copper exactly see you could
[00:07:04] say who likes Chi-Chi I do well like
[00:07:08] okay I kind of don't because they don't
[00:07:10] generate particles or anything but
[00:07:12] they're I don't know you know what I
[00:07:19] [Music]
[00:07:20] mean CLE was free for you no CLE was not
[00:07:23] free for me cuz number
[00:07:25] one
[00:07:27] uh the conversion rate is is completely
[00:07:30] [ __ ] so even if it was donated
[00:07:31] Canadians usually lose money and number
[00:07:33] two is donated by Yulie who's a friend
[00:07:36] of mine and I'd rather him keep his
[00:07:38] money then give it to me to spend on a
[00:07:41] character that I'm not using like it's
[00:07:43] not free like I I don't know I didn't
[00:07:45] want you I feel bad okay it's fine it's
[00:07:47] fine I I'll go gift them Subs I don't
[00:07:51] know Chi is a cry batter yeah true true
[00:07:54] true
[00:08:00] I like CLE though I actually like I but
[00:08:02] I don't want to like I don't like her
[00:08:03] play style it's weird it's like G like I
[00:08:06] like G but I don't enjoy charge shotting
[00:08:09] so I don't play
[00:08:10] her but I'll probably play her whenever
[00:08:12] she gets a rerun just to make you know
[00:08:17] content also cuz I don't have Mona and I
[00:08:20] can't play her actual team comp can you
[00:08:24] bit like the buff Chi No I don't think
[00:08:27] the way to buffing CH I don't think okay
[00:08:29] I think the way to buff Chi-Chi is to
[00:08:31] not buff Chi-Chi but buff content where
[00:08:33] Chichi's good so Chichi's indirectly
[00:08:35] buffed without buffing Chichi and then
[00:08:36] you buff Chichi without buffing chii
[00:08:38] what I mean by that is places like the
[00:08:39] new floor 9 Abyss where you take
[00:08:41] constant damage you actually need to
[00:08:43] heal if you're afraid of death and not
[00:08:45] afraid of time you can you can
[00:08:48] capitalize on that by going on a Healer
[00:08:49] that heals you a [ __ ] ton maybe in
[00:08:51] places where Shields aren't that good to
[00:08:53] where healing is actually useful to
[00:08:54] where Chichi is actually useful but for
[00:08:56] now not that useful um although they
[00:08:58] should probably give her particles but
[00:09:02] yeah no G slander no listen here Thunder
[00:09:06] 027 I like G okay but since G is the
[00:09:10] most broken character in the game and
[00:09:12] the strongest one ganu Mains are uh
[00:09:15] privileged by having it easy okay Gaines
[00:09:18] you guys get to break Breeze every
[00:09:20] content where we're struggling you can
[00:09:22] be like wow that was a breeze okay so
[00:09:24] we're allowed to poke some Jabs at your
[00:09:26] character that's just we're allowed if
[00:09:28] there's any character that that's
[00:09:29] allowed a bit of slander it's gone you
[00:09:31] but that's just cuz she's broken I still
[00:09:33] think she's cute and her story is great
[00:09:35] all right I got a friendship seven
[00:09:36] that's good friendship seven [ __ ] look
[00:09:39] at my look at my
[00:09:41] shin I'm sorry that was
[00:09:43] toxic uh okay before the let me just go

[00:09:48] go I don't know if there's any time
[00:09:50] sensitive thing in the teapot but let me

[00:13:56] uh I think it's random but you you're
[00:13:59] guaranteed it at like day seven from my
[00:14:01] understanding that's what I
[00:14:11] thought yep okay we can do a Gamba then

[00:15:40] happening you admit Shia is small no
[00:15:42] Shia is tall it's just jly is uh a God
[00:15:45] so he he cheated by making himself uh
[00:15:48] taller than every other character

[00:33:09] we're going to keep going and then we'll
[00:33:10] roll a bunch at a time we're just dude

[00:34:00] fine accepted okay all right good
[00:34:03] luck honestly uh I'm feeling pretty
[00:34:06] lucky today
[00:34:07] so I think you're in for uh think you're
[00:34:10] in
[00:34:12] for a good
[00:34:22] time we clear so [ __ ] fast with Shia
[00:34:25] it's insane like Shia is probably the
[00:34:28] best character to clear this domain I
[00:34:29] can't think of AIT I mean okay I guess g
[00:34:31] is G
[00:34:32] but yeah g is G but still I mean she
[00:34:37] can't really proc reactions though I
[00:34:39] don't know how much worse is snow t on
[00:34:41] YULA compared to archaic not much
[00:34:43] they're
[00:34:46] similar got you with the cryo bonus oh
[00:34:48] yeah yeah true you get the yeah okay I
[00:34:50] forgot about this [ __ ] okay true true
[00:34:51] true you guys are right you guys are
[00:34:52] right actually true if you get the cryo
[00:34:55] or pyro bonus then uh whichever
[00:34:58] character gets that would be better but
[00:35:00] hey still though this this like this
[00:35:02] clears so fast cuz like you Clump
[00:35:04] everything together and then sha just
[00:35:06] literally one shots everything even a
[00:35:08] sha without my investment like a mid
[00:35:10] investment sha would still like bro I'm
[00:35:13] killing them before my ALT end so even
[00:35:15] like a worse Tri would like that a 20
[00:35:18] second clear
[00:35:31] not bad
[00:35:37] potential I wonder know which one Shia
[00:35:38] gets a rerun people say that every time
[00:35:41] I stream and then it makes me wonder
[00:35:42] like am I going to make people spend
[00:35:44] money on Shia and
[00:35:46] then I'm like actually I don't really
[00:35:48] feel bad cuz Shia's good and everyone
[00:35:51] should pull for sha so it's
[00:35:53] okay I don't care [ __ ] it if you save
[00:35:56] your gems skip every other banner and
[00:35:58] pull for sha I will be
[00:36:02] proud I don't know maybe the new
[00:36:04] characters are going to be busted like
[00:36:05] you should probably pull for like ball
[00:36:07] or something
[00:36:11] but oh we got an account review hello Mr
[00:36:13] socks I need help with my
[00:36:20] account bro okay listen guys when I open
[00:36:25] your in link and it says load six 60
[00:36:27] more
[00:36:32] images guys guys
[00:36:40] I bro
[00:36:51] uh okay I'm not going to do this cuz I
[00:36:54] dude
[00:36:55] like it's 60
[00:37:01] [Music]
[00:37:04] images so here's what I'm going to tell
[00:37:06] you if you want me to look through your
[00:37:07] individual
[00:37:08] artifacts give me your friend code if
[00:37:10] you're not na then give me an imager but
[00:37:12] give me an imager of your characters if
[00:37:14] you want teams put all your characters
[00:37:15] but if you just want specific characters
[00:37:17] put your characters in your ratios or
[00:37:19] artifact sets don't show every
[00:37:20] individual piece because then it's like
[00:37:22] a 100 [ __ ] pages and I'm not going to
[00:37:24] go through that
[00:37:28] like it's a lot easier for me to do like
[00:37:32] in an account viw to do like or I guess
[00:37:34] you can't how do I show this I can't
[00:37:36] right now but it's a lot easier to do it
[00:37:37] in game than to [ __ ] scroll through
[00:37:39] an m
[00:37:48] page I'm lost in this adventure rank
[00:37:51] because my oh uh if you're ar40 just
[00:37:54] Adventure literally explore like I
[00:37:56] guarantee you if you explore
[00:37:58] all of monad leeway just literally run
[00:38:00] around get chest do quests plus all the
[00:38:02] dragon spine [ __ ] plus all the Inazuma
[00:38:04] [ __ ] like you're actually going to you
[00:38:07] can get so high AR and then you spend
[00:38:09] your resin you do your dailies like
[00:38:10] that's all you have to do just literally
[00:38:11] have fun like until ar50 just have fun
[00:38:14] and you'll level up passively
[00:38:16] um
[00:38:21] yeah AA I wouldn't put AA in my video I
[00:38:24] don't think she's a quote uh I don't
[00:38:26] want to talk about it I don't think AA
[00:38:28] is like a DPS like she is but she's like
[00:38:31] a Betto style like it's weird her charge
[00:38:34] attacks are pretty dog [ __ ] but her
[00:38:36] burst is really good so I consider like
[00:38:38] a right now consider a burst support but
[00:38:41] you can also consider strangling that
[00:38:44] who's also a DPS so it's weird like it
[00:38:48] depends I don't know
[00:39:03] like like you can I don't know it's
[00:39:05] weird like she is a
[00:39:07] DPS but
[00:39:14] like how do I explain
[00:39:18] this I think she's more of like a quick
[00:39:21] swappy DPS where her team is also doing
[00:39:24] a lot of the damage and like her optimal
[00:39:26] teams are [ __ ] free teams and freeze
[00:39:28] teams are really good but they're not
[00:39:31] the highest like DPS ceiling teams
[00:39:33] they're good because nothing moves and
[00:39:35] you get to run blizzard ster and because
[00:39:36] it's just comfy and
[00:39:39] [ __ ] you consider a drawback that Shang
[00:39:41] Ling needs a festar enabler
[00:39:44] child uh no I consider it a drawback
[00:39:47] that people don't understand how the
[00:39:48] character works so they ask questions
[00:39:49] like that I'm sorry I don't want to
[00:39:51] roast you but
[00:39:53] look
[00:39:55] bro Shang Ling Shang Ling in a fourstar
[00:39:59] only team is better than YULA Shang Ling
[00:40:00] in a fourstar only team is better than
[00:40:02] Hut czo Shang Ling in a fourstar only
[00:40:04] team is better than most of the
[00:40:06] characters in genin like Shang Ling
[00:40:09] doesn't need child Shang Ling with child
[00:40:11] is optimal but Shang Ling with singu is
[00:40:14] [ __ ] broken and better single uh well
[00:40:17] better than child single Target but uh I
[00:40:20] like I still like child better but you
[00:40:21] know what I
[00:40:24] mean like Shang Ling is probably the
[00:40:28] most okay she's not flexible cuz she
[00:40:30] needs Bennett and a hydro character so
[00:40:32] she does need a specific team which is
[00:40:34] her biggest drawback but she doesn't
[00:40:36] need any five stars she needs Bennett
[00:40:38] and either singu or child child can be a
[00:40:40] replacement for singu or like a
[00:40:43] alternative um and then the last
[00:40:45] character can be sucros who's a four
[00:40:46] star or if you want I mean sucros is
[00:40:48] usually just the best but kazua can
[00:40:51] sometimes be better but anyway Suk or
[00:40:53] kazua or even Chong Yan can work or even
[00:40:56] aaka can work or J Le can
[00:41:03] work Shia is the same as aaka by that
[00:41:06] metric no not at all if you want to make
[00:41:07] the argument of aaka being a same type
[00:41:10] of DPS as another character it would not
[00:41:12] be Shia it would be Shang Ling Shang
[00:41:14] Ling's damage comes from her burst uh
[00:41:17] Shia's doesn't Shia's damage comes from
[00:41:18] his plunges which yes is during his
[00:41:21] burst but he's not a burst like you have
[00:41:24] to be on field with sha the thing I'm
[00:41:26] saying is with AA you can press Q Swap
[00:41:28] and that's usually [ __ ] optimal like
[00:41:30] aa's Optimal team is like with guu where
[00:41:32] you literally press Q on AA and then go
[00:41:34] to ganu like Shia isn't like that so
[00:41:37] it's not the same at all but if you want
[00:41:39] to make the argument for like you should
[00:41:41] rank aaka as a DPS then you would
[00:41:42] compare her to Shang Ling or bet where
[00:41:44] it's like why aren't these characters
[00:41:46] supports and yeah I just don't think
[00:41:50] AA I think aa's really good in a lot of
[00:41:54] specific teams but I don't think her
[00:41:56] alone as like or even her
[00:41:59] team how do
[00:42:06] like like her damage just from her is
[00:42:09] probably not top five but she has a lot
[00:42:11] of teams that are really good like
[00:42:12] freeze teams but it's not just like yeah
[00:42:17] that that that's that's that's it I end
[00:42:19] my sentence there
[00:42:31] like I consider her a sort of either
[00:42:34] quick swap carry or burst
[00:42:36] support um because she has teams where
[00:42:39] she's really good but she's not like
[00:42:43] she's not a hyper carry and she's not
[00:42:44] like on the same level of damage as like
[00:42:48] a sha and she's very single Target well
[00:42:51] no okay she's not single Target when
[00:42:52] paired with [ __ ] like venti who clumps
[00:42:55] up and then you I Al but her burst is
[00:42:58] usually only good against one enemy cuz
[00:42:59] it like [ __ ] like it's weird it's
[00:43:02] really
[00:43:03] weird does the je really say that Razer
[00:43:05] might be better than YULA yes but he
[00:43:08] like that the thing with a lot of these
[00:43:10] quote unquote conclusions and
[00:43:12] comparisons is that always assumes
[00:43:14] something okay my top five DPS assumes a
[00:43:17] very specific set of criteria that I
[00:43:18] established for 10 minutes when zff says
[00:43:20] that in his streams he very very often
[00:43:23] says ranks characters does his tier list
[00:43:26] all that b based around your first 36
[00:43:28] star so at relatively low investment
[00:43:30] because what matters in this game yes
[00:43:33] people play to speedrun yes people play
[00:43:34] Endgame but usually what's actually
[00:43:36] relevant is getting your first 12 star
[00:43:38] clear in the abyss so at that level of
[00:43:40] investment and he evaluates characters
[00:43:41] with like constellations on four stars
[00:43:43] but not on five stars and with four star
[00:43:45] weapons so at low investment yes your
[00:43:48] razer's probably going to do more than
[00:43:50] your Ula but at high investment your Ula
[00:43:52] is going to do more than your razer so I
[00:43:53] like Ula more than Razer because overall
[00:43:55] she's better and has a higher ceiling
[00:43:57] but if you're like early game or mid
[00:43:59] game yes Razer is going to do more so he
[00:44:01] likes Razer more than youa what do you
[00:44:04] think about yo Mia you asked that 10
[00:44:06] [ __ ] times bro calm the [ __ ] down
[00:44:08] it's your only messages in chat what

[00:45:12] anything bad it's just don't SP my chat
[00:45:14] for that
[00:45:25] [ __ ] uh yeah Flame the new set is
[00:45:27] optimal for sh okay I don't want to say
[00:45:29] that people don't okay the new two-piece
[00:45:32] not for not four piece cuz I said like
[00:45:35] Shain have an emote of the new set
[00:45:37] called like new set copium and I was
[00:45:39] like the new set's not copium it like
[00:45:41] it's good and then they're like you're
[00:45:42] trolling right I was like oh no I mean
[00:45:43] the two-piece and they're like okay but
[00:45:45] yeah like the two-piece is like his it's
[00:45:48] you can yeah either run the new
[00:45:50] two-piece with glad or the new two-piece
[00:45:53] with verid descent or just two glad to
[00:45:55] vescent there's three viable builds
[00:45:57] they're all very
[00:45:59] similar the four piece isn't good though
[00:46:02] for a lot of
[00:46:04] reasons like a lot of reasons like uh
[00:46:07] damage percent isn't even that needed
[00:46:09] and then it [ __ ] your energy and it's
[00:46:11] just yo mosquito thanks for the six
[00:46:15] months I appreciate you chat it's our
[00:46:17] six month anniversary people thank you
[00:46:19] for the people flower I know it's for
[00:46:21] Chad but I took the flower get [ __ ]
[00:46:24] chat okay guys I know we've been
[00:46:27] checking
[00:46:28] artifacts but for the remainder we're
[00:46:30] going to not check them and then we're
[00:46:31] going to check them all at
[00:46:33] once do I do more refreshes just cuz I
[00:46:35] want to no I
[00:46:39] shouldn't but it's a bonus stream we're
[00:46:41] crazy we're crazy on bonus streams we
[00:46:43] waste all our Primo gems [ __ ] it and
[00:46:45] I'll use a fragile not yet we'll do it
[00:46:47] after [ __ ] it cuz the day is going to
[00:46:49] reset so we might as well uh we're going
[00:46:51] to check all our artifacts at once but
[00:46:53] before we do that we have no more
[00:46:54] artifact space so we're going to um
[00:46:56] level the the ones we got so what did we
[00:47:00] get um oh I forgot we got
[00:47:04] that dude look at this beauty oh my I
[00:47:07] have to take a picture before I roll it
[00:47:08] just in case just in case dude hey
[00:47:12] this bro if you could sell an artifact
[00:47:15] on eBay like if there was a a grand
[00:47:17] Exchange in this game I would be able to
[00:47:19] sell this for like honestly 1,000 Primo
[00:47:22] gems minimum no it'd be more I would how
[00:47:25] much would I pay for this artifact you
[00:47:26] would pay like 20 bucks for a chance to
[00:47:29] roll this no cap like this is worth this
[00:47:32] is like this is some Primo gems dude on
[00:47:35] the black market Ain you sell this [ __ ]
[00:47:37] sh dude some whale dude no you guys are
[00:47:41] are you guys are saying no but if you
[00:47:43] could if let's you could only sell plus
[00:47:45] zero artifacts Tony toe would buy this
[00:47:48] for like 100 bucks guaranteed like No
[00:47:50] Cap I would be
[00:47:51] rich but I wouldn't sell it cuz I know
[00:47:53] it's going to roll good so yeah uh we're
[00:47:56] going to start start by testing our RNG
[00:47:58] today uh the way I do this is by Rolling
[00:48:02] a lesser artifact see how it goes if it
[00:48:04] goes good we're happy if it goes bad we
[00:48:06] do a luck reset and the way you do that
[00:48:09] is you spend money on the game you do
[00:48:10] one single pull and then mihoyo's like
[00:48:12] oh they're spending money let me reset
[00:48:14] their luck and then we go again okay
[00:48:16] where's my flower I can't find it was it
[00:48:18] plus 4 oh there it is all
[00:48:21] right should we do a Gamba chat you guys
[00:48:24] like
[00:48:24] gambas okay quick Gamba
[00:48:32] 30 seconds to vote on one roll only I
[00:48:35] usually don't do this but one roll will
[00:48:37] this next roll be crit or [ __ ] you have
[00:48:40] 30 seconds to vote it's our this our
[00:48:42] test this is our test
[00:48:52] run I'm yeah I'm feeling a crit damage
[00:48:54] too uh h i i we're on the same
[00:48:56] wavelength I think it's going to be crit
[00:48:57] damage I think after this roll we're
[00:48:59] going to be at 14 crit
[00:49:09] damage you know what guys you remember
[00:49:11] that that defense artifact we got uh a
[00:49:13] few streams
[00:49:15] ago you know it might it might have been
[00:49:18] the most painful thing I've ever rolled
[00:49:20] but at least it gave me Twitter clout so
[00:49:22] it's fine it was worth it in the long
[00:49:24] run like think about it what's more
[00:49:25] worth it a couple like a hundred likes
[00:49:28] or a good artifact
[00:49:31] exactly okay never why is that under all
[00:49:35] my tweets okay all right it's fine it's
[00:49:38] fine it's fine okay okay okay

[00:49:46] time I like all
[00:49:48] right all right here goes nothing this

[00:50:22] feeling this going to be crit actually

[00:50:25] crit rate watch

[00:56:14] hurts but here's the bright side it's
[00:56:18] usable it is at least
[00:56:21] usable okay there's a bright side
[00:56:25] because now I can actually run the
[00:56:27] emblem
[00:56:28] Set Don't Stop coping guys listen I can
[00:56:32] actually run the set now shut up we can
[00:56:34] actually run it okay guys guys guys
[00:56:37] everyone that's typing copium I hate you
[00:56:39] okay we can actually use the set
[00:56:42] now just just please bear with me
[00:56:46] okay um and then we run a Sands like
[00:56:48] this
[00:56:51] one it's not bad oh we're very low on
[00:56:54] crit damage yeah we probably want a crit
[00:56:55] damage ciret okay maybe I am coping uh I
[00:57:01] hate this game all right whatever [ __ ]
[00:57:02] it all right whatever whatever shut up
[00:57:17] chat two to one
[00:57:22] ratio I mean are okay no charact
[00:57:25] realistically
[00:57:27] realistically it's going to take us a
[00:57:29] while before any character has a good
[00:57:31] like a ratio as good as our Jong lead so
[00:57:33] we have to be accepting of a bit worse
[00:57:36] ratios like not every character is going
[00:57:39] to be a giga Chad with a 1 to like 12 or
[00:57:41] some [ __ ] like this this it takes a
[00:57:43] while okay takes a
[00:57:46] [Music]
[00:57:48] while it takes a while okay we're going
[00:57:51] to check all our artifacts at once now
[00:57:53] so the first thing I'm going to do is
[00:57:54] make some inventory space
[00:57:59] and then after that we're just going to
[00:58:01] keep going and L check everything at the
[00:58:02] same
[00:58:03] time I'll just clear like
[00:58:07] 100 how many do I have I actually don't
[00:58:10] have that many okay we'll only clear
[00:58:11] this I have a lot of five stars I should
[00:58:13] probably throw away some five stars so
[00:58:14] many of them are locked like it's
[00:58:17] [Music]
[00:58:19] insane yeah like I have so many
[00:58:21] artifacts that
[00:58:23] have oh that wasn't locked I was like
[00:58:25] why the
[00:58:28] [ __ ] uh yeah so many are locked that
[00:58:30] have potential
[00:58:36] but holy what the
[00:58:46] [ __ ] no
[00:58:48] anyways all right uh are all my new
[00:58:51] artifacts cleared let me check
[00:58:54] emblem yes they are and then
[00:58:59] reminescence now they are okay cool
[00:59:02] let's
[00:59:07] go hoarder mentality the thing with
[00:59:10] genin is like you kind of have to hoard
[00:59:13] artifacts cuz there's so many artifacts
[00:59:15] that can look bad that have potential
[00:59:16] you know yo greyman thanks for the prime
[00:59:19] appreciate you like for example an
[00:59:21] artifact that I have um look I'll show
[00:59:23] you guys right now no
[00:59:31] dude there's
[00:59:32] not there's actually nothing more
[00:59:34] tilting than accidentally pressing your
[00:59:43] alt that's actually the most annoying
[00:59:46] thing and it happens so often okay okay
[00:59:49] okay wait wait but like okay look at
[00:59:51] this Chad look at this I'm about to
[00:59:53] educate all of you okay you're all going
[00:59:54] to be taking notes you know what just
[00:59:56] just because I'm going to educate you
[00:59:57] guys I'm going to add the noted emote
[00:59:58] watch I'm going to literally add an
[01:00:00] emote just for this moment look emotes
[01:00:03] uh how do you check emotes emotes
[01:00:12] noted wait where is it where's the good
[01:00:15] one it's this one right wait what is
[01:00:16] this that's not
[01:00:20] bad wait do we get a wee one or do we
[01:00:22] get a people
[01:00:27] I'm not adding a
[01:00:31] GRE what's the best one shot the
[01:00:37] people
[01:00:41] okay top emotes are there any I don't
[01:00:48] have oh guys okay I need pee poof no
[01:00:52] one's ever going to use it but it's
[01:00:53] pretty funny where is it
[01:00:56] look it's like a pee hop but then he
[01:01:00] poofs but no one's ever going to use it
[01:01:04] so anyways I'm about to educate you guys
[01:01:07] watch this okay
[01:01:10] so if we look at my goblets of the Pyro
[01:01:14] variety so pyro damage bonus okay
[01:01:17] there's artifacts that look like this
[01:01:19] that I lock because it's power damage
[01:01:22] two garbage stats and one good one right
[01:01:24] so you might be like copium garbage
[01:01:26] right but once I had an artifact that
[01:01:28] was exactly this it was pyro crit
[01:01:31] defense defense okay I leveled it to
[01:01:33] four it got another crit stat then I
[01:01:36] kept leveling it and then it became this
[01:01:38] goblet it was defense crit defense then
[01:01:40] it became it got crit rate and then it
[01:01:42] only rolled crit okay so that's why I
[01:01:45] lock all these artifacts cuz there's a
[01:01:46] chance that they become this five
[01:01:49] head um but also I become like a harder
[01:01:52] cuz look how many go guys let's count
[01:01:53] the power goblets 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
[01:01:58] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 most of them
[01:02:04] are locked all of those except this one
[01:02:06] are
[01:02:07] locked
[01:02:10] yeah when will you level them I just I
[01:02:13] don't need a pyro goblet but if I do I
[01:02:16] load it I mean I I roll
[01:02:21] it oh I wasn't supposed
[01:02:23] to pretend we didn't see that we're
[01:02:25] going to be surprised when we check that
[01:02:27] later just pretend guys erase your
[01:02:29] recent memory just
[01:02:35] just just pretend okay we're going to
[01:02:37] roll it I don't want to cheat the Gamba
[01:02:38] okay just let's roll it pretend just
[01:02:40] guys guys guys it's going to be dog [ __ ]
[01:02:42] anyways okay it doesn't matter it's
[01:02:43] actually going to be dog [ __ ] so it does
[01:02:44] it wouldn't have changed the Gamba
[01:02:46] trust look if it rolls crit I'll I'll
[01:02:49] I'll make it up to you guys but it's not
[01:02:51] going to
[01:02:52] watch trust me guys I know my luck
[01:03:00] it's actually not
[01:03:05] bad okay we're going to roll it uh did I
[01:03:08] just roll something bad oh yeah it's a
[01:03:10] circet though I got to keep it
[01:03:21] [Music]
[01:03:24] okay okay [ __ ] this go I don't care cryo
[01:03:28] that's not bad Electra is not
[01:03:30] bad but it's also Electra on this set
[01:03:32] yeah [ __ ] this goblet
[01:03:40] [Music]
[01:03:41] too okay I mean it's not bad we take
[01:03:45] those
[01:03:47] uh this has a lot of potential cuz
[01:03:49] there's so many stats that could be good
[01:03:51] but if it rolls like everything so
[01:03:53] here's the thing with these artifacts
[01:03:54] okay if it rolls everything one roll
[01:03:56] into everything it's dog [ __ ] but if it
[01:03:58] focuses on like one or two like only
[01:04:00] crit and ER or only crit and attack then
[01:04:02] it's good
[01:04:05] so there's a lot of potential now do I
[01:04:08] really want to spend all this Mora and
[01:04:11] XP on this one artifact some would say
[01:04:14] yes some would say no a smart man would
[01:04:17] say no but luckily for me I am not a
[01:04:20] smart man so we're going to roll it
[01:04:37] what the [ __ ] is this okay we'll put one
[01:04:38] artifact
[01:04:39] in Good Luck
[01:04:43] chat not bad for emblem not bad to get
[01:04:46] an ER roll okay potential uh is it
[01:04:50] better than our other feather or is
[01:04:53] it oh okay wait I didn't mean that
[01:04:57] one dude I wish I had something to throw
[01:05:01] man
[01:05:07] honestly I'm about to do something dumb
[01:05:09] guys please stop me okay [ __ ] this piece
[01:05:12] there's no world where I use this piece
[01:05:14] [ __ ] this piece I don't care it can go
[01:05:15] to hell I don't give a [ __ ] good luck
[01:05:19] [Music]
[01:05:22] chat um
[01:05:27] that's fine like er is not bad on emblem
[01:05:30] it's not
[01:05:33] useless
[01:05:35] but yeah it kind of
[01:05:38] yeah okay never mind relatable
[01:05:41] content it's fine that was I told you
[01:05:44] guys it would be bad so now we get to
[01:05:45] we'll check all the artifacts at once
[01:05:46] it's
[01:05:47] fine wait it's a new day how did I not
[01:05:50] get my welon do I get it when I leave
[01:05:51] the
[01:05:53] domain good night you DJ Jen listen I'm
[01:05:57] I have a good sleep schedule look I
[01:05:59] wasn't planning on streaming today but I
[01:06:01] knew look at how responsible I was I
[01:06:03] knew I wasn't going to sleep early so I
[01:06:05] said [ __ ] it I might as well just stream
[01:06:08] so that I I'm like I have a reason to
[01:06:10] stay up
[01:06:11] easy although um I should be like
[01:06:15] editing my video but I don't know I got
[01:06:17] I got lazy I got
[01:06:22] bored much you already get the max 75%
[01:06:25] damage from set bro it's 25% of your ER
[01:06:27] just do the math but anyways uh like 75
[01:06:31] * 4 but the point is um you you never
[01:06:34] want it like even with the new
[01:06:37] set you still don't want to Stack the
[01:06:40] new set does not okay a lot of people
[01:06:42] don't know this so I'm going to say it
[01:06:44] I'm going to say it clearly the new set
[01:06:46] does not change how much ER you need on
[01:06:48] any character you still need the exact
[01:06:50] same amount of er that you previously
[01:06:52] did you don't want more you don't want
[01:06:54] less you still want the exact same
[01:06:56] amount if before you wanted 140 you
[01:06:58] still want 140 you don't want to go
[01:07:00] overboard because anything over how much
[01:07:03] ER you need is worse than attack percent
[01:07:05] actually it's worse than flat attack
[01:07:07] like it's actually not needed because it
[01:07:10] gets converted to damage but not that
[01:07:12] much so you still want just as much ER
[01:07:15] as you uh needed before although excess
[01:07:17] ER doesn't isn't useless is just not
[01:07:23] good are you going to make the how much
[01:07:25] for every character video it's on my
[01:07:26] notepad of videos to make but it's not
[01:07:28] my priority right now cuz it it's really
[01:07:30] just it depends but I will make it
[01:07:33] eventually I think I
[01:07:37] hope I'm waiting for a new anemo boy to
[01:07:40] come out so s can make a full anemo boy
[01:07:41] team yeah but it would have to be like a
[01:07:43] shielder or a
[01:07:46] Healer cuz Shia without a Healer is very
[01:07:50] cope
[01:07:59] chat sa is not an anemo boy how is
[01:08:05] saou the dude said anemo boy
[01:08:09] team cuz like we I could use Gan if that
[01:08:12] wasn't the the statement [ __ ] Pega
[01:08:17] chat how do you know I mean okay like
[01:08:21] it's voiced by Lily Pichu I mean hey
[01:08:23] maybe she's voicing a boy but
[01:08:28] like
[01:08:33] [Music]
[01:08:40] anyways V's V8 yeah but okay you guys
[01:08:44] are actually dumb the the IQ of my chat
[01:08:46] is literally negative right now guys
[01:08:49] mihoyo is allowed to say if a character
[01:08:51] is a guy or a girl bro I'm guarantee you
[01:08:53] it's confirmed somewhere
[01:08:56] you guys are one head actual one heads
[01:08:59] right
[01:09:01] now there's no way there's not a single
[01:09:03] voice line that's going to refer to the
[01:09:04] character by a
[01:09:08] pronoun actually
[01:09:10] onead there is no
[01:09:22] way oh I wasn't we didn't see that we
[01:09:25] didn't see
[01:09:32] that wait
[01:09:35] I I was going to pull up the I was going
[01:09:37] to pull up the trailer but I just
[01:09:39] Googled saou I just Googled it why is
[01:09:41] there a why is there a guide out who's
[01:09:43] making a guide I know this is probably
[01:09:45] leak so I'm not going to show it but
[01:09:47] how's it going everyone who are
[01:09:53] you yo how's
[01:10:00] what am I looking how much do you
[01:10:03] upload oh it's another
[01:10:10] game huh
[01:10:13] anyways Razer talks [ __ ] oh okay fair
[01:10:22] enough yeah they're usually I mean
[01:10:25] there's a reason why kaching Mains
[01:10:27] stopped making guid about leaks like
[01:10:29] kaching Mains don't even Theory craft
[01:10:30] leaks anymore that's how unreliable they
[01:10:33] are and because I assume Miho doesn't
[01:10:34] want it they like obviously it's
[01:10:36] unreliable but yeah and [ __ ] changes so
[01:10:39] much like if you yeah like G is a pretty
[01:10:42] good
[01:10:43] example G's scaling is so broken dude it
[01:10:47] was hard to predict like yeah g is going
[01:10:48] to be a
[01:10:53] [ __ ] guys from the future sure
[01:10:57] yeah the guy Razer ninas was roasting
[01:11:00] this morning really that's awesome I
[01:11:02] mean I don't I don't know the dude but
[01:11:03] it's awesome that we both found the same
[01:11:11] thing what happened to Majestic chat I
[01:11:14] only knew like I was like is he is he
[01:11:17] still uploading or is he
[01:11:22] bonked got banned oh damn
[01:11:26] I'm going to miss
[01:11:33] the welcome everyone okay I'm sorry but
[01:11:37] dude for real though I don't know it was
[01:11:40] kind of it was weird like it's it's
[01:11:42] [ __ ] terrifying how do you not get
[01:11:44] like a warning or
[01:11:47] something like okay I hate
[01:11:51] look I don't like leakers and uh not as
[01:11:55] a personal like just from like a a moral
[01:11:57] standpoint like I don't think you should
[01:11:58] be making your living off of stealing
[01:12:01] content leaking it monetizing it and
[01:12:03] like I don't think that's how it should
[01:12:04] happen but oh he ignore the warnings oh
[01:12:07] okay all right we're fine never mind
[01:12:09] then never mind never mind never mind
[01:12:11] never
[01:12:16] mind wait why did he why did he keep
[01:12:18] going why did he just make
[01:12:25] yeah I don't know it's still scary
[01:12:27] though it's still in my opinion it's
[01:12:29] still terrifying that like as a content
[01:12:31] creator you can just okay mx's a bad
[01:12:34] example cuz he was leaking and got
[01:12:35] warned I didn't know he got
[01:12:38] warned um but yeah it's scary dude
[01:12:42] imagine just not being able to upload
[01:12:43] videos like your whole livelihood is
[01:12:45] gone like like for me this is why I'm
[01:12:48] not committing to this like I could
[01:12:50] probably be a full-time content creator
[01:12:52] like realistically and look I don't flx
[01:12:55] cuz I don't like I do this to help
[01:12:56] people
[01:12:58] and hey wait wait wait wait wait
[01:13:08] wait no clip today no clip today but
[01:13:14] anyways my point was
[01:13:17] if I'm not supposed to check okay it's
[01:13:22] fine okay my point was
[01:13:29] I I'm still like a full-time student
[01:13:32] right so like I don't I'm not committed
[01:13:34] to this but the reason I don't is
[01:13:35] because it's it's scary like you could
[01:13:37] literally just get become irrelevant
[01:13:39] within a day so it's not worth
[01:13:40] committing to at least from my
[01:13:42] perspective but I'm definitely at the
[01:13:43] point where I could like realistically
[01:13:45] there's no
[01:13:47] guide uh and this is because I'm
[01:13:49] credible so hopefully that doesn't
[01:13:50] change but realistically there's no
[01:13:52] guide that
[01:13:57] um how do I explain this I'm at a point
[01:14:00] where like people will watch any guide I
[01:14:02] put out which I'm grateful for so that
[01:14:04] that means consistency and growth which
[01:14:07] is good because it means like stability
[01:14:09] and then you can commit to it if you
[01:14:10] want to so that's all good but it's
[01:14:13] still too scary and too unreliable so I
[01:14:15] don't this guy's ego I mean it's true
[01:14:18] though
[01:14:19] like here's the thing guys most people
[01:14:22] commit to like being a YouTuber or a
[01:14:25] streamer or whatever at a lot lower than
[01:14:27] where I am okay this is just me being
[01:14:30] guys I'm talking to you guys like I
[01:14:31] appreciate you guys but I'm saying like
[01:14:32] most people become full-time at less
[01:14:34] than 200k Subs right
[01:14:36] like like and I'm I'm still a law school
[01:14:40] student like it it's impairing how much
[01:14:42] I
[01:14:43] can play this game and I know I might
[01:14:46] burn out if I do it full-time
[01:14:49] but yeah you know what I mean so my
[01:14:53] point is
[01:14:56] I could but I don't think I should
[01:14:58] because it's just like it's scary dude I
[01:15:01] don't
[01:15:05] know you like wull yes I really do I
[01:15:08] just no I mean like I yeah I like
[01:15:16] it it's less fun with quarantine though
[01:15:18] cuz I lost the whole I lost the
[01:15:22] experience like it used to be like
[01:15:25] like I made you'd make a lot of friends
[01:15:27] you'd make connections you'd go to like
[01:15:29] social events where you'd like there's
[01:15:31] just a lot of [ __ ] and parties and stuff
[01:15:32] like you lose the whole experience if
[01:15:34] you're doing it online like I it's yes
[01:15:37] the classes are interesting but like
[01:15:39] nobody goes for I don't know at
[01:15:42] least the people like me and my friends
[01:15:45] like no one goes to college just for the
[01:15:47] [ __ ] classes like yes obviously you
[01:15:49] want to learn and like the classes are
[01:15:50] fun if you studying something you like
[01:15:52] but there's also like meeting people
[01:15:54] parties so like [ __ ] that gets you a job
[01:15:57] later that I'm losing out on because
[01:15:59] realistically what's my CV now okay like
[01:16:01] if you I think of it from a like a law
[01:16:03] perspective what is my CV like you're
[01:16:04] supposed to do like volunteering like
[01:16:06] pro bono work and then you're supposed
[01:16:07] to do like like I could have worked
[01:16:09] under a teacher as like a assistant or
[01:16:11] something and realistically what did I
[01:16:13] do instead I sure I got pretty good
[01:16:15] grades in my classes but I decided to be
[01:16:19] a streamer and have a YouTube channel as
[01:16:21] like
[01:16:22] my hobby right but that that's usually
[01:16:25] not what you're supposed to do so I
[01:16:27] can't put that on a YouTube I'm I'm on a
[01:16:30] some like a CV like it's
[01:16:35] not so I am somewhat even without
[01:16:39] committing to this I am somewhat
[01:16:41] committing to it because I'm hindering
[01:16:43] my other avenues kind of thing like
[01:16:49] yeah we'll
[01:16:52] see like I'm going to wait basic
[01:16:54] basically I'm going to graduate in a
[01:16:56] year or two uh a year or two I'm going
[01:16:59] to graduate and then I'll make a
[01:17:00] decision like okay I'm just going to
[01:17:02] YouTube or okay I'm just going to do the
[01:17:04] other [ __ ] right it depends how it goes
[01:17:05] I got to stop checking [ __ ] okay guys
[01:17:07] it's going to be a scuffed Gamba it's
[01:17:08] going to be a super scuffed Gamba I
[01:17:11] apologize CV number one
[01:17:14] sh
[01:17:23] yeah screenshot your
[01:17:28] Goblin I mean like real okay if I had
[01:17:31] the like obviously I enjoy law right but
[01:17:33] if I had to choose what I wanted to do
[01:17:37] obviously I would pick streaming like
[01:17:38] this is enjoyable I can literally do
[01:17:39] whatever the [ __ ] I want talk you guys
[01:17:41] yes it's stressful yes it's a lot of
[01:17:43] work like it doesn't seem like a lot of
[01:17:44] work but like the amount of time I put
[01:17:46] into YouTube is more than the amount of
[01:17:48] time I need to get like straight A's
[01:17:50] right like the amount of effort I have
[01:17:52] to put into YouTube is a lot higher so
[01:17:54] it is a lot lot of work but I enjoy it
[01:17:56] so it doesn't matter so realistically I
[01:17:58] had to pick it would be this but I don't
[01:18:00] want to commit to this because I'd
[01:18:03] rather have a good backup plan and
[01:18:06] because
[01:18:09] um it's unreliable like it there's a
[01:18:12] chance like dude there's a
[01:18:15] like a lot of content creators that I
[01:18:19] used to watch don't make videos anymore
[01:18:21] there's a lot of people
[01:18:23] that don't do it anymore there's a lot
[01:18:25] of people that people stop watching
[01:18:27] there's a lot of people that get
[01:18:28] canceled there's a lot of people like
[01:18:29] there's a lot of [ __ ] that could go
[01:18:30] wrong okay uh and I know I'm a good
[01:18:32] person and stuff but
[01:18:34] like like I don't know like [ __ ] might
[01:18:37] happen I might accidentally one day be
[01:18:39] like I I dude I don't know I might say
[01:18:42] something offensive that I don't know is
[01:18:43] offensive like I'm scared I think a lot
[01:18:46] before talking when I stream cuz I don't
[01:18:47] know like I know my intentions are good
[01:18:49] but a lot of the time I can come across
[01:18:51] like I don't know and same thing with
[01:18:53] like YouTube videos like if I just
[01:18:56] like okay I'm pretty reliable
[01:18:57] information wise cuz I research a lot
[01:18:59] but so I know my guys are qual oh [ __ ]
[01:19:02] this the next day I'm not supposed to
[01:19:04] refresh it's fine well it's
[01:19:07] [Music]
[01:19:11] fine no uh I don't think Jinx and tuner
[01:19:14] uh I don't jinx stopped because his
[01:19:16] mental uh and I love Jinx like I watch
[01:19:19] his videos um but he stopped cuz his
[01:19:22] mental wasn't there like he wanted a
[01:19:24] break or like there was drama and [ __ ]
[01:19:27] but
[01:19:29] like he could have kept going
[01:19:33] okay um and often times when there's
[01:19:37] drama I still think drama is good I'm
[01:19:40] not the type of person to get involved
[01:19:41] in drama what the [ __ ] was that Al I'm
[01:19:44] not the type of person to get involved
[01:19:45] in drama but
[01:19:48] like like it would literally be
[01:19:50] beneficial to start drama just so that I
[01:19:52] can have beef with someone people from
[01:19:54] both sides will watch both streams then
[01:19:57] you'll pick a side and then eventually
[01:19:58] both people will end up making out oh
[01:20:00] it's okay I didn't mean it it was a
[01:20:02] misunderstanding n and then both content
[01:20:04] creators like each other it's always
[01:20:06] like that and so I think like yeah it's
[01:20:09] it's usually beneficial like I'm not
[01:20:11] going to do that but
[01:20:13] yeah I know the tuner thing's different
[01:20:16] but it's still his his mental I know

[01:20:35] even involved in the drama he'll just
[01:20:36] say something like what this guy said
[01:20:39] was unacceptable because n n n and then
[01:20:41] viewers will Spike like it yeah it's
[01:20:45] just drama's always worth it but I don't
[01:20:47] do it because I don't like it I'm a
[01:20:49] little [ __ ] like I don't want to have
[01:20:50] someone not like me like I'd rather be

[01:22:08] turning do AA M aa's cool and I Ms are
[01:22:11] probably cool I don't really know them
[01:22:13] but I'm sure they're cool usually when
[01:22:15] guys it's weird and I know I guess it's
[01:22:18] Mains being passionate about their
[01:22:19] character but usually when I like a
[01:22:20] character the mains of that character
[01:22:22] like me and when I don't like a
[01:22:24] character
[01:22:26] actually that's not true it's only YULA
[01:22:27] I don't know never
[01:22:28] mind uh yo account review also yo zidus
[01:22:32] thanks for the prime I appreciate you
[01:22:34] welcome
[01:22:37] welcome okay this is a good imager I
[01:22:39] appreciate you
[01:22:41] okay um looking for advice on what new
[01:22:44] teams I can use okay I'll open my team
[01:22:47] thing uh guys should I get a Gengar key
[01:22:51] cap it's kind of cute okay anyways uh
[01:22:58] okay advice on what new teams I can use
[01:23:01] okay you said new teams does that mean
[01:23:04] characters that you're H I'll just make
[01:23:06] you good teams it's fine okay so you
[01:23:08] have a you have Shia and child so you
[01:23:10] already have good
[01:23:11] teams yeah you have really good teams or
[01:23:14] good characters uh a lot of [ __ ] you
[01:23:17] have three
[01:23:18] wolves uh you also have a jade cutter
[01:23:22] and hom yeah pretty good weapons
[01:23:25] Shield bot dra Le four M with black
[01:23:27] tassel that's
[01:23:29] good oh yeah uh yeah these both work run
[01:23:32] whichever one you
[01:23:33] need this is going to be more damage but
[01:23:35] if your Shield breaking go
[01:23:38] that good CH enough ER too
[01:23:46] nice it's kind of low what weapon are
[01:23:49] you
[01:23:50] running oh veresen okay that makes sense
[01:23:53] yeah try to go for a crit damage
[01:23:55] uh oh yeah why are you 150 ER yeah
[01:23:57] probably just unlucky sub stats yeah
[01:23:59] definitely uh probably work child is
[01:24:01] like your worst so far the others are
[01:24:03] really good though so you could probably
[01:24:04] improve by just grinding the artifact
[01:24:05] domain cwell 840m that's really good or
[01:24:08] good enough Shang Ling is
[01:24:18] fine yeah okay all right this pretty
[01:24:20] easy I'll make you teams cuz that's what
[01:24:22] it mainly is the one thing I'd say is is
[01:24:24] child could have more crit damage but
[01:24:27] the main character you should focus on
[01:24:28] is Shang Ling cuz she does more damage
[01:24:29] than child in the team like people that
[01:24:31] think child is the DPS and a child Shang
[01:24:32] Ling team are capping and it's like
[01:24:35] usually people that just like child but
[01:24:37] like Shang Ling does way more so invest
[01:24:39] in your Shang Ling first give her a bit
[01:24:41] more crit rate if you can but overall
[01:24:43] pretty good uh Team comp wise pretty
[01:24:46] easy I would say run the characters you
[01:24:47] like so if the characters if the teams I
[01:24:50] make you like if you have a preference
[01:24:52] cuz there's a lot of DPSS you could use
[01:24:54] but what I would make is a shadow team
[01:24:56] and a child changling team or child B so
[01:24:59] your second team would be either child
[01:25:00] changling or child B ficial and then a
[01:25:03] Healer or jangly or something but uh I'm
[01:25:05] going to do Shang Ling
[01:25:08] so where is
[01:25:11] she CH am I
[01:25:14] oh so I would do this and then your sh
[01:25:16] team would be do you have venty you do
[01:25:19] so you put venty uh jongi and then
[01:25:22] you're goated your last character Here
[01:25:23] Is A Healer your last character here is
[01:25:26] uh probably sucros or kazwa yeah you
[01:25:29] have Kaza level 90 I'd use Kaza [ __ ] it
[01:25:31] yeah I like Kaza sucros can be better
[01:25:33] but I like Kaza so yeah that's what I
[01:25:35] would do but you can also use sucros
[01:25:36] they both work your Kaza is level 90 and
[01:25:37] high investment though that's why uh you
[01:25:39] also there's no sucros here
[01:25:42] so last character here doesn't matter I
[01:25:45] mean it has to be healer never mind do
[01:25:46] you have
[01:25:48] Gan okay you have a few options you
[01:25:52] actually have a few options you can
[01:25:53] either just put a generic healer here
[01:25:55] like Dion or something or you could do
[01:25:57] no veny put Jean and then put like
[01:26:00] another battery like fishal so these are
[01:26:02] there's a lot of example like Shia has a
[01:26:03] lot of good teams pick your
[01:26:06] favorite uh this is really good but if
[01:26:09] you want to run venty with a sha you can
[01:26:12] um
[01:26:16] yeah venty isn't good with sha no venty
[01:26:18] still amazing with Shia people think
[01:26:20] venty isn't but venty is still amazing
[01:26:21] with Shia trust me like venty is the
[01:26:24] most like stupidly broken character it's
[01:26:27] [ __ ] insane how broken this guy is
[01:26:29] his scaling is more DPS than your
[01:26:31] favorite DPS like this [ __ ] does
[01:26:34] so much damage it's absolutely insane
[01:26:36] like against a lot of like okay against
[01:26:39] heavy enemies it'll push them together
[01:26:40] without lifting them in the air so Shia
[01:26:42] can plunge them
[01:26:43] against small enemies he'll kill them so
[01:26:46] it doesn't matter if Shia can plunge
[01:26:47] them and you can burst and then swap
[01:26:49] your other characters like venty burst
[01:26:52] okay benett burst venty burst jly Shield
[01:26:54] burst and then go sh and Shia burst like
[01:26:56] you can do other [ __ ] wall shits in the
[01:26:57] air or you can uh use your Shia e e and
[01:27:01] then Shia burst and when the animation's
[01:27:02] done they'll be falling down like venty
[01:27:06] yeah ven is really good so yeah up to
[01:27:08] you and it depends what you're doing
[01:27:10] like some content needs venty some
[01:27:11] content
[01:27:17] doesn't save
[01:27:18] to what did I mon
[01:27:30] so's venty shrimp yeah I like venty I
[01:27:33] mean I think vent is just I think venty
[01:27:35] is more broken than people give him
[01:27:36] credit to honestly I think vent's insane
[01:27:40] [Music]
[01:28:02] [Music]
[01:28:04] and he's not underrated he is people
[01:28:05] think he's
[01:28:07] like zff explained why like cuz he's
[01:28:11] broken and people know he's broken but
[01:28:13] people rank him under other characters
[01:28:15] that they think are more broken like
[01:28:17] yeah venty literally invalidates content
[01:28:20] you don't even need a DPS with veny
[01:28:21] genuinely like he's absolutely
[01:28:24] absolutely
[01:28:31] busted like Alexi thinks ven is a lot
[01:28:34] better than jongle I don't know if I
[01:28:36] agree I'm not sure
[01:28:39] uh but
[01:28:42] yeah random question what's so bad about
[01:28:45] C6 Bennett it makes some of your it
[01:28:48] makes Bennett unplayable in certain
[01:28:50] teams it's good for most teams though so
[01:28:52] you can do it if you want but for some
[01:28:55] teams like physical DPS you can't run
[01:28:57] Bennett with them if you're Bennett C6
[01:28:59] so I am never going to activate it at
[01:29:01] least in the near future unless we can
[01:29:03] toggle constellations which reminds me I
[01:29:04] should do the survey because
[01:29:08] um because I don't want to risk like I
[01:29:10] play every character so I don't want to
[01:29:14] have I don't want to like
[01:29:18] [Music]
[01:29:19] invalidate certain team comps

[01:40:17] sounds like a 12-year-old
[01:40:21] R I'm just going to I'm just going to
[01:40:24] I'm just going to do this I'm
[01:40:26] just okay okay okay guys guys let me
[01:40:29] okay I have to explanation as to why
[01:40:33] these are all relevant for you further
[01:40:39] [Music]
[01:40:42] below number
[01:40:49] one if there is difficult
[01:40:53] Co-op content here is what will
[01:40:57] happen players will team up with their
[01:41:01] friends and invite their other IR other
[01:41:07] uh friends to start playing this game
[01:41:12] not only will that increase the player
[01:41:16] base but by being repeatable it will
[01:41:21] also increase the view uh player
[01:41:32] [Music]
[01:41:35] retention furthermore wait
[01:41:39] furthermore
[01:41:41] furthermore if it is
[01:41:44] difficult players
[01:41:48] who do not have the best of characters
[01:41:53] or who do
[01:41:58] not or who aren't that mentally gifted
[01:42:03] no who I don't want to insult players
[01:42:05] who aren't
[01:42:09] that okay people that don't know Shang
[01:42:11] Ling is good basically like people who
[01:42:13] think they don't have good characters
[01:42:15] you know what I mean guys you know what
[01:42:16] I mean I mean like IQ of like two like
[01:42:18] you know what you know what I mean like
[01:42:19] people that are like I can't clear Abyss
[01:42:23] because I have no good characters when
[01:42:24] they have like a C4 Shang Ling and a C6
[01:42:27] bet you know like you know what I'm
[01:42:29] talking about or who aren't I mean maybe
[01:42:32] you're just not as obsessed with the
[01:42:33] game as I am that's okay or who aren't
[01:42:35] uh or who
[01:42:37] aren't [ __ ] it who don't have the best
[01:42:39] of characters or who are weak will spend
[01:42:43] money on characters they want and think
[01:42:47] they need example shinan player spends
[01:42:52] money
[01:42:53] for sh
[01:42:56] Banner
[01:42:58] example
[01:42:59] example example that's just an example
[01:43:02] that's just an example
[01:43:04] okay you know we'll make uls happy
[01:43:07] actually never mind [ __ ] that okay what
[01:43:10] they think they need sh
[01:43:15] better so with this easy solution
[01:43:20] doctors hate them
[01:43:24] not only are
[01:43:27] players players very happy and Twitter
[01:43:31] will once actually like you instead of
[01:43:35] can no no will once actually like
[01:43:38] you but you will also make a lot of
[01:43:44] money so people will like the game
[01:43:46] people will play the game people will be
[01:43:47] happy and they'll make money it's
[01:43:49] literally a win-win will they read this
[01:43:52] essay yes cuz I wrote money and caps I
[01:43:53] wrote profit you think this is enough to
[01:43:56] keep their
[01:43:56] attention explanation as to why these
[01:43:58] are relevant for you further
[01:44:02] below uh explain why these are all
[01:44:04] relevant and will make
[01:44:08] money hey spam
[01:44:12] dollar okay
[01:44:15] okay apparently it was like a apparently
[01:44:19] there's like
[01:44:20] a like for like the International report

[01:44:25] uh apparently for the international
[01:44:27] reports that the US would do to like the
[01:44:32] the I'm not going to never mind but
[01:44:34] basically if you write someone what
[01:44:36] they're looking basically there's a
[01:44:37] study that shows if you write what
[01:44:39] someone's interested in a [ __ ] ton in an
[01:44:41] article they're going to keep reading so
[01:44:42] if we keep writing money just a bunch of

[01:45:32] money now you may be
[01:45:36] wondering how will the other
[01:45:40] suggestions wow that is an amazing
[01:45:44] suggestion but how will the other
[01:45:47] suggestions make us
[01:45:50] money well I'm glad you
[01:45:55] asked if we can pet the dogs equal free
[01:46:00] advertisement
[01:46:04] to casual gamers equal more players
[01:46:08] equal play uh more players plus players
[01:46:13] happy if toggle constellations actually
[01:46:16] that one won't make the money that's
[01:46:17] that's the cap so I'm not going to talk
[01:46:18] about that
[01:46:21] if if if more
[01:46:26] [Music]
[01:46:28] skins if
[01:46:31] more skins shirtless
[01:46:36] tartaglia uh cat ear Jong Lee I'm just
[01:46:39] giving them ideas beach
[01:46:42] ball that's so funny why did I think of
[01:46:45] that
[01:46:46] earlier dude beach ball okay guys guys
[01:46:50] guys hear me out hear me out hear me out
[01:46:51] hear me out it's like a coer skin but
[01:46:53] it's funny so it'll work it'll work guys
[01:46:56] I like
[01:46:57] this uh what else what else what else
[01:47:01] uh uh I don't know dude who's another
[01:47:04] character
[01:47:05] people uh uh Shia but tall no no Shia I
[01:47:10] don't know example Etc
[01:47:12] okay equal
[01:47:15] people will
[01:47:18] pay oh wait also you could make make it
[01:47:23] a community goal for like a animal
[01:47:28] charity or to rescue animals and even if
[01:47:34] you are thinking why do we care about
[01:47:38] animals we are a company in a
[01:47:42] capitalism why should we
[01:47:46] care well that is okay because luckily
[01:47:50] for
[01:47:51] you you can can just pretend to care and
[01:47:55] get very
[01:47:57] good uh
[01:48:04] advertisement okay if more skins people
[01:48:06] will pay if rare pets equal increase
[01:48:10] player base and player
[01:48:13] retention because we actually will have
[01:48:17] something to do that isn't resin locked
[01:48:20] and player retention is more important
[01:48:25] than
[01:48:26] actual gacha stuff
[01:48:29] since Not Dead game equal money longterm
[01:48:34] when you release gotcha
[01:48:38] stuff love you all right we're done
[01:48:42] pretty pretty good pretty good uh
[01:48:44] there's a few grammar mistakes but [ __ ]
[01:48:46] it uh there's a lot of like M
[01:48:49] transations and grammatical errors in
[01:48:51] actual genin so I'm sure this be fine
[01:48:55] um guys okay here hear me out I think
[01:49:00] like they don't even have to care like
[01:49:04] dude this is a Flawless argument okay if
[01:49:06] they make us petting the dogs behind a
[01:49:08] community goal that's towards the all
[01:49:10] the money we spend is towards a charity
[01:49:12] helping animals it makes them look like
[01:49:15] a good company even if they don't give a
[01:49:16] [ __ ] about animals like genuinely like
[01:49:19] you don't even dude it's like all the
[01:49:20] companies that put a [ __ ] pride flag
[01:49:22] for PR 5 months and then take it down
[01:49:24] the day after like you don't even have
[01:49:26] to dude you can just pretend to care and
[01:49:28] you'll make more money it's actually
[01:49:30] stupid but it's how it works so I hope
[01:49:32] they read
[01:49:34] this
[01:49:37] okay don't forget your phone
[01:49:40] number okay okay I think this is pretty
[01:49:46] good um
[01:49:58] I'm just going to polish
[01:50:08] this I think this is good you think
[01:50:10] shirtless Tagle would scare him out such
[01:50:15] as beach ball or shirtless
[01:50:21] tartaglia all right we're cracked we're
[01:50:24] actually
[01:50:27] cracked all right guys I think beach
[01:50:30] ball dude I should that's that's a fire
[01:50:33] idea that's actually a fire
[01:50:39] idea 60 Primos that only took like 20
[01:50:43] minutes for 60 Primos that was worth it
[01:50:46] wait where are they it's only 50

[01:54:30] haven't even checked the artifacts yet
[01:54:32] okay we're going to see how many we have
[01:54:34] and we'll check
[01:54:36] them I know I accidentally checked a
[01:54:38] bunch so this might be weird but we have
[01:54:40] 3 4 5 6 78 reminescence
[01:54:47] and I think that's 12 I kind of counted
[01:54:50] fast but it looks like 12 so a bit more
[01:54:51] on the emblem side you guys are going to
[01:54:53] have 2 minutes to vote while I do this
[01:54:55] which set's going to be better we're
[01:54:56] going to check all our artifacts at the
[01:54:57] same time uh and then I'll probably do a
[01:54:59] few more I'll do an abyss clear and then
[01:55:01] yeah I'll probably end at like 3 hours
[01:55:03] in cuz I wasn't I streamed really late
[01:55:05] so uh okay let me set up the Gamba which
[01:55:08] set better artifacts emblem orence you
[01:55:10] have 2 minutes to vote it's going to be
[01:55:11] the biggest gam on all of twitch so
[01:55:13] spend your channel points uh yeah it's
[01:55:16] about it go look yes because you spent
[01:55:18] 30 minutes replying Mi hoyo guys I have
[01:55:21] already given suggestions to Mi hoyo
[01:55:23] that have been added to the game because
[01:55:26] of me and I have proof of it so when
[01:55:29] inevitably you guys get to pet dogs or
[01:55:31] when shirtless tartaglia or beach ball
[01:55:33] come out you guys can thank
[01:55:39] me no
[01:55:41] true you guys will have me to thank
[01:55:57] waiting for my free beach ball skin it's
[01:55:59] not going to be free I don't think like
[01:56:02] I I'm yeah I think there should be skins
[01:56:05] that are like rare like friendship 10 or
[01:56:06] whatever but realistically they won't be
[01:56:09] free it would be cool but
[01:56:13] yeah do you run ODS because I never get
[01:56:16] no I don't run outs on Twitch cuz I
[01:56:18] don't do twitch for money like it
[01:56:19] doesn't matter I'm just vibing
[01:56:24] although I do appreciate your Twitch
[01:56:25] primes cuz those are free smile but yeah
[01:56:27] no I I don't know you didn't write sha
[01:56:30] on in a ma dress bro why okay I'm not
[01:56:34] I'm not going to judge you
[01:56:36] but give him cat years it would be 10
[01:56:39] times
[01:56:44] better also that was Pepe W yo Jons
[01:56:48] thank you for the Prime game appreciate
[01:56:50] you thank you
[01:56:53] they should make the secret pet yeah I
[01:56:56] okay I think pet there should be pets
[01:56:58] for like literally every Elite enemy
[01:57:00] that's like a one in 3,000 or something
[01:57:03] one in 5,000 so you actually have to
[01:57:05] like kill enemies like let's say you
[01:57:07] want a slime pet you have to [ __ ]
[01:57:08] hunt slimes for like a month like that'd
[01:57:11] be sick cuz then people would actually
[01:57:12] play the
[01:57:15] game it's like why I was addicted to
[01:57:17] [ __ ] RuneScape dude pets are the best
[01:57:21] look at that damage [ __ ]
[01:57:25] what about freeo play players that can't
[01:57:27] afford the shirtless tartaglia yeah then
[01:57:28] they're not going to be freet to play
[01:57:29] anymore guys I have met people who would
[01:57:33] literally marry child from genin Impact
[01:57:35] okay I like I have met people who think
[01:57:38] that they could change him okay so I'm
[01:57:42] telling you they would not be free to
[01:57:44] play anymore that's all I'm saying now
[01:57:45] do I wish that the Skins would be free
[01:57:47] to play yes but I'm just saying that
[01:57:49] even if they
[01:57:50] aren't they mihoyo is going to make
[01:57:53] money
[01:57:54] like
[01:57:56] [Music]
[01:58:04] yeah all right we're going to check the
[01:58:06] new artifacts guys we got a bunch of
[01:58:08] arax let's check
[01:58:13] [Music]
[01:58:20] them um inventory okay we're gonna start
[01:58:23] with emblem just to make doubters feel
[01:58:25] bad because that's what we do
[01:58:29] here okay that's actually not bad pyro
[01:58:32] goblet on reminescence is actually not
[01:58:38] bad but the
[01:58:40] feather also not
[01:58:42] bad that's a pretty bad mask flower
[01:58:53] okay all right all right those are all
[01:58:55] dog [ __ ] except uh this was okay and
[01:58:57] this is pretty good um okay let's look
[01:59:01] at the emblem set so first of all we got
[01:59:03] a
[01:59:09] goblet first of all we got a
[01:59:11] feather okay not bad uh crit rate ER
[01:59:14] this might get crit damage so we can
[01:59:15] level that not
[01:59:17] bad that's pretty bad ciret
[01:59:26] dude all my good pieces are flowers man
[01:59:30] literally all my good pieces are flowers
[01:59:32] look boom
[01:59:34] boom only flowers you want to see what
[01:59:37] my feather looks like you want to see
[01:59:39] what my other feather looks
[01:59:41] like okay it's
[01:59:44] fine this is good good for believers
[01:59:51] [Music]
[01:59:54] I'm angry I'm actually angry I'm
[01:59:56] actually angry why are all my flowers so
[01:59:59] good I don't want a flower dude okay
[02:00:03] okay guys I'm okay
[02:00:07] um okay we'll we'll level it I mean
[02:00:10] Believers win I'm sorry but like our
[02:00:12] flowers are too good
[02:00:14] [Music]
[02:00:16] goblet
[02:00:20] yeah anyways uh we should probably just
[02:00:23] level them uh I'm going to start with
[02:00:24] the
[02:00:25] feather cuz why
[02:00:28] not but yeah I feel like we don't need
[02:00:30] that many flowers though that's the
[02:00:32] problem like we already have two that
[02:00:33] are good we don't need that many I'm
[02:00:35] going to lock this
[02:00:39] yeah one piece emblem all right
[02:00:42] dude uh yeah I'd rather
[02:00:50] not yeah like this is so good man and we
[02:00:53] have another
[02:00:55] one um this one's definitely better does
[02:00:59] have kind of low rolls

[02:11:15] happens yo wait okay wait a second wait
[02:11:19] a minute okay that's one artifact that's
[02:11:23] one this is two we're just going to get
[02:11:26] this to four just to see you know there
[02:11:27] might be attack percent might be energy
[02:11:30] recharge so we'll just get this to four
[02:11:33] might as
[02:11:35] well that's fine okay that's two
[02:11:38] artifacts that we're going to roll this
[02:11:40] will get to four as well it might get
[02:11:41] crit rate you
[02:11:43] know this time I won't spoil it I'll
[02:11:45] look away I'll cover booba's eyes don't
[02:11:49] look em that's
[02:11:52] copium um that could be
[02:11:58] good okay we're going to start with this
[02:12:01] you might be thinking this feather is
[02:12:03] trash but there's a chance it only rolls
[02:12:05] crit damage and becomes a 40 crit damage
[02:12:07] piece so we always roll those okay it
[02:12:09] missed good to know we can throw it now
[02:12:10] we're going to do the same with the
[02:12:11] flower which is a bad flower but if it
[02:12:13] only rolls crit damage it'll be a 40
[02:12:15] crit damage piece and then it'll be good
[02:12:16] and then I'll be like wow I was there
[02:12:17] when Z got a 40 crit damage piece I
[02:12:18] can't believe it and then we'll be happy
[02:12:20] together okay
[02:12:22] unlucky it's
[02:12:24] fine
[02:12:28] um is that it what the why is this
[02:12:39] locked
[02:12:41] oh dude if this gets crit damage if this
[02:12:45] is crit damage I will actually sell my
[02:12:47] right
[02:12:48] nut okay never mind
[02:12:52] but it's okay because we had another
[02:12:56] piece this one this could also get CR
[02:13:00] damage put booba back he's tired no
[02:13:02] booba will help with the rolls just not
[02:13:04] for the uh not for finding a new a new
[02:13:06] stat trust trust trust trust trust okay

[02:17:01] to get a crit piece guaranteed but it
[02:17:03] would hurt so we're not going to do that
[02:17:05] although they're not that good but wait
[02:17:08] that that one's not
[02:17:11] bad more strong box copium guys you

[02:18:03] thinking like at some point our luck
[02:18:05] will catch up to us
[02:18:07] but okay what if we throw those pieces
[02:18:11] back in it's like the double down mihoyo
[02:18:13] never expects a double down it's
[02:18:15] actually in their TOS like they say like
[02:18:18] don't double down or you might break the
[02:18:21] game that's actually what they say so
[02:18:22] we're going to double down and we're
[02:18:24] guaranteed a good piece
[02:18:32] now I can't be stopped chat I cannot be

[02:19:03] not stopping you think I'm stopping chat
[02:19:05] if I stopped I would have missed out on
[02:19:07] these two artifacts what think about the

[02:19:12] have this Sands or this
[02:19:14] feather I mean okay okay okay wait wait

[02:19:29] these artifacts go terribly and I sell
[02:19:32] all my artifacts to do this and then I
[02:19:34] end up getting no artifacts so I pepega
[02:19:36] swipe lose all my money lose my job
[02:19:38] mortgage my house and go bankrupt it
[02:19:41] will be worth it because we got to spend
[02:19:42] this time together and we got to go
[02:19:44] through this journey together and if if
[02:19:47] like this is just this is like me
[02:19:49] preventing you from going down the same
[02:19:51] addiction that I am it's like how the
[02:19:53] gambling streamers will be like it's
[02:19:54] okay cuz you see how much I lose it's
[02:19:56] the same thing like it's literally the
[02:19:58] same copium it's like guys it's
[02:20:03] like okay okay watch watch watch watch
[02:20:05] look at this look at this look at
[02:20:11] this oh dude Hey where's the copium now
[02:20:15] chat where's the copium now we're going
[02:20:17] to win big guys guys
[02:20:22] watch this
[02:20:25] roll that's actually good that's
[02:20:27] actually a three that's pretty
[02:20:34] good
[02:20:40] okay I'm kind of low on artifact XP now
[02:20:42] I I mean I know why shut up you don't
[02:20:45] have to tell me but I'm kind of low on
[02:20:48] artifact XP um
[02:20:52] uh what if we
[02:20:55] um okay we don't need this piece
[02:20:57] realistically we're going to Auto add
[02:21:00] and then hopefully it gets us
[02:21:02] to
[02:21:07] 12 hey attack percent is good you guys
[02:21:10] might think it's not cuz you're not as
[02:21:13] uh uh Min maxer as I am but attack
[02:21:15] percent is not
[02:21:17] bad um
[02:21:24] see the thing is if it keeps rolling
[02:21:25] crit it's better than this cuz this
[02:21:27] missed a roll but it went to HP you know
[02:21:29] so if this misses a roll but it's into
[02:21:33] crit uh but it's into attack then it's
[02:21:36] not really a Miss roll right cuz attack
[02:21:37] is good
[02:21:48] um HP good for home I mean not really
[02:21:52] it's it's still it's still not that good
[02:21:54] like even if I'm running hom Shia I
[02:21:56] still don't want
[02:22:01] HP okay I don't want that much attack
[02:22:05] though okay listen listen listen listen
[02:22:08] this is like okay this is like good for
[02:22:11] Shia but this is like a ZF piece like if
[02:22:15] zff would see this he'd be like this is
[02:22:17] amazing don't throw this how dare you
[02:22:18] throw this like this is like
[02:22:21] okay but guys
[02:22:35] guys this isn't copium cuz there's a
[02:22:37] chance it only rolls crit it's not
[02:22:39] copium listen guys I promise
[02:22:42] you okay never mind never

[02:27:13] row I hope you get Chi-Chi on your next
[02:27:15] five star not because I'm sure you're a
[02:27:16] great person but just because you said
[02:27:19] it four times it clearly means you just
[02:27:21] want to see the downfall of Zio like if
[02:27:23] you if you said like do it for Content
[02:27:25] that would have been hype but if you say
[02:27:27] do it do it again do it once more that's
[02:27:29] like that's [ __ ]

[02:29:05] I might make a video instead I'm not
[02:29:07] sure I can do the account review yeah uh
[02:29:10] later I'll wait for G to find
[02:29:16] it is it just a feather Flex
[02:29:20] bro it's literally a feather how is this
[02:29:22] an account
[02:29:23] review bro what you spent 17K Channel
[02:29:26] points on
[02:29:28] this
[02:29:32] huh
[02:29:33] [Music]
[02:29:36] um I
[02:29:40] mean it's not bad it's good it's a good
[02:29:43] feather um although see the thing is
[02:29:46] this is good for most people but if I
[02:29:48] were to roll this right now and I rolled
[02:29:50] something like this today chat would
[02:29:52] just Spam copium cuz that's how high our
[02:29:54] standards are at this point like guys I
[02:29:56] showed this before a while ago my stream
[02:29:59] but I feel it's been long enough so I
[02:30:01] can show it again if we look at my Razor
[02:30:03] guide okay uh we'll look at the old one
[02:30:06] so this one is eight months ago best
[02:30:08] razor
[02:30:09] build did I mention serpent fine in
[02:30:11] November I wonder did Z in November was
[02:30:14] he credible where's serent spine
[02:30:17] weapons type and some ores which makes
[02:30:19] it nice and you can refine it by you
[02:30:22] know being free to Yo wait I actually
[02:30:24] didn't know
[02:30:27] this it I'm going that's November first
[02:30:29] of all the effect will give you% more
[02:30:32] damage because it'll give you six 6%
[02:30:34] more you're the best 30% more Dage dude
[02:30:37] you remember when people thought burning
[02:30:38] grass would [ __ ] you up
[02:30:40] yeah if you don't Dodge properly so
[02:30:42] there's skill cap on this weapon yeah
[02:30:44] the weapon looks good the base attack is
[02:30:46] pretty good the effect is good but
[02:30:48] honestly the best part and this what I
[02:30:49] don't see people talking about is the
[02:30:51] the second set which is crit rate and
[02:30:53] crit rate is so good on Razer cool I
[02:30:56] don't need to keep listening to myself
[02:30:57] but okay uh that's not the point that's
[02:31:00] not the point guys one of the top
[02:31:01] comments on this video one of the top
[02:31:04] comments on this video uh they really
[02:31:06] need to have the system where you can
[02:31:07] pet cats and dogs eight months ago yep
[02:31:10] uh I'm actually going to pin this
[02:31:11] comment but that's not what I'm looking
[02:31:14] for
[02:31:18] uh that God roll flower LOL someone is
[02:31:23] liked by R Jesus I replied what did I
[02:31:25] say for real laau okay so this is at the
[02:31:29] point where a flower that I put in the
[02:31:31] video was a big Flex okay now what is
[02:31:35] that flower you guys might think you
[02:31:36] guys think oh is it a flower like uh is
[02:31:39] it a flower that looks something like
[02:31:41] you know um maybe uh you know maybe
[02:31:44] something like this right is it just an
[02:31:45] insane God roll let me show you what the
[02:31:49] what was considered an insane piece 8
[02:31:51] months ago cuz people were like oh Z has
[02:31:53] the best artifacts 8 months ago this is
[02:31:55] the flower I had chat
[02:31:59] this dude this was considered like god
[02:32:03] tier when I made this it has attack 49
[02:32:07] flat 10% attack 13 crit damage and zero
[02:32:11] crit rate rolls it literally only rolled
[02:32:13] crit once plus
[02:32:15] 20 but uh yeah I think I was like ar45
[02:32:19] or something at the
[02:32:22] time but
[02:32:24] yeah HP for FL wait what were my other
[02:32:27] stats wait let me look the main what's
[02:32:28] my feather did I show my feather okay I
[02:32:32] still use that today yeah that R yeah I
[02:32:35] remember the plus I still have that okay
[02:32:37] that is kind of that it's kind of
[02:32:41] copia yeah okay kind of cop dude look at
[02:32:44] my artifacts I have two circlets oh dude
[02:32:48] I miss old zogs
[02:32:52] anyways it just goes to show how far
[02:32:54] we've come cuz now you guys copium
[02:32:57] anything I get that isn't perfect like
[02:32:59] what's what's a good example of
[02:33:00] something we copium okay this is this
[02:33:02] okay
[02:33:04] but I mean even this is copium like
[02:33:07] everything that isn't amazing is just
[02:33:11] cop okay we're not going to talk about
[02:33:18] that all right I I need to get the clear
[02:33:22] done um so Ula we're going to run her
[02:33:26] secondo half but the thing with second
[02:33:28] half is uh the the the stupid Sonic
[02:33:30] [ __ ] are actual pieces of [ __ ]
[02:33:33] with Ula cuz you can't kill them unless
[02:33:36] you burst but like if you burst they
[02:33:37] just dig away so it's actually cancer um
[02:33:52] we'll do this [ __ ] it Shia Jong Le benty
[02:33:59] Jean abys clear is a stress reliever for
[02:34:02] Z actually it is yeah that's why I'm
[02:34:03] really looking forward to the next Abyss
[02:34:05] cuz it's always like hard it's good
[02:34:06] content we get to stream for like
[02:34:08] [ __ ] 26 hours and then after I get to
[02:34:10] make a guide on it which is content and
[02:34:11] it helps people and then once we go from
[02:34:14] [ __ ] this is hard in you to okay this
[02:34:16] actually like I'm getting used to it
[02:34:18] then it becomes like somewhat easy and

[02:38:11] see guys don't anyway SM I this stream
[02:38:14] was not supposed to happen I wasn't
[02:38:15] planning on streaming today I just said
[02:38:17] [ __ ] it I want to stream and I started
[02:38:19] stream like 3:00 a.m. and now it's 7:00

[02:38:32] appreciate you guys thanks for being
[02:38:33] here smile but
[02:38:39] yeah I think uh so I was planning on
[02:38:41] streaming tomorrow but I think what I
[02:38:43] could do is I could um I mean I could
[02:38:45] still stream tomorrow if I have time but
[02:38:46] I could just make the video tomorrow
[02:38:48] upload it get it done and then but yeah
[02:38:52] I could also ask someone else to edit
[02:38:54] the video and then just stream but I
[02:38:56] kind of want to edit it myself so yeah
[02:38:59] and by ask I mean pay but
[02:39:03] yeah yo wait that sub happened as I
[02:39:06] started my music again that was
[02:39:08] weird thanks for the prime uh Lloyd
[02:39:11] what's up
[02:39:15] dude wa why do I have no particles
[02:39:18] Mona okay this is
[02:39:20] weird uh it's fine we don't need
[02:39:28] them Abyss reset tomorrow not really
[02:39:31] though like Abyss reset is tomorrow but
[02:39:33] it's tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. so unless I
[02:39:35] want to stream at 5: a.m. which I could
[02:39:38] honestly I might uh I I'll do the abyss
[02:39:40] reset the day after I might do an early
[02:39:42] okay so I'd either do a late stream
[02:39:44] tomorrow or an early stream the day
[02:39:45] after I'm leaning more towards early
[02:39:46] stream the day after but it could go
[02:39:49] either way so we'll see collector Pros I
[02:39:52] did don't worry I did
[02:39:55] that I did that
[02:39:57] yesterday I almost forgot
