[00:14:08] star rail uh actually wait we have to
[00:14:11] recap on some genon things before we
[00:14:12] talk about Star first of all first of
[00:14:14] all
[00:14:16] uh I went to the Gin concert it was
[00:14:18] great I met a lot of you if you saw me
[00:14:22] you were cool hello sorry if I was sleep
[00:14:24] deprived but it was fun uh second of all
[00:14:27] the concert itself was good
[00:14:30] um the only things are that the only
[00:14:33] thing that saddened me was there was one
[00:14:35] no Shia theme except they played G theme
[00:14:37] and no one disrespect the G but that
[00:14:39] [ __ ] sorry that lovely respectable
[00:14:43] woman was like laying on the ground oh
[00:14:44] my God I have no job and then wakes up
[00:14:46] and starts playing music Shia literally
[00:14:48] suffering literally lament it's okay but
[00:14:51] it was a good it was a good thing uh the
[00:14:53] most the thing I mainly like wish was
[00:14:56] better was there was a lack of sumeru
[00:14:58] and font music but they played Port
[00:15:04] ormos so that was really good um I
[00:15:06] enjoyed it but anyways uh met a lot of
[00:15:09] people so that was cool um we will be
[00:15:12] I'm not in a wardrobe okay we'll be home
[00:15:14] tomorrow anyways I anyways welcome to
[00:15:17] the stream uh I looked into a lot of
[00:15:19] doctor ratio things we'll talk about
[00:15:20] that also I looked at the like okay we
[00:15:24] don't discuss leaks on this
[00:15:25] channel period but I also I let's just
[00:15:28] say I'm ready for 2.0 let's just move on
[00:15:30] but uh I did a lot of I did a lot look
[00:15:35] I'm still addicted to genin but for some
[00:15:36] reason I went down the turbo rabbit hole
[00:15:38] for like 10 hours of some star rail
[00:15:41] stuff
[00:15:41] yesterday
[00:15:44] um
[00:15:46] so my understanding on on some speed TC
[00:15:49] things are better which is nice uh I
[00:15:52] feel
[00:15:53] enlightened but
[00:15:55] anyways welcome to the Stream we have a
[00:15:58] lot to talk
[00:16:00] about we have a lot to talk about a lot
[00:16:02] to do bro join the Dark Side because
[00:16:05] okay here's the thing every time I think
[00:16:07] there's something that looks really
[00:16:08] complicated it makes me not want to look
[00:16:10] at it but then when I look at it it's
[00:16:12] like way simpler than I thought except
[00:16:14] gauge Theory Elemental gauge Theory it
[00:16:16] looked complicated you look into it it's
[00:16:17] complicated cuz everything has like one
[00:16:19] U or four or two U or 3 U or 1.5 U or 05
[00:16:23] and then you like don't know and then
[00:16:24] the E just removes the [ __ ] Aura it
[00:16:26] is what it is but for the most part uh
[00:16:28] uh uh uh uh uh it's not that bad so um
[00:16:32] yeah we're going to um what the [ __ ] is
[00:16:35] this we're going to not stall today
[00:16:38] we're going to not stall we're going to
[00:16:41] not
[00:16:43] stall we're going to not stall when does
[00:16:46] he stop Stall oh I geared all of my St
[00:16:49] characters when I launched the game you
[00:16:50] guys are going to see that's number one
[00:16:51] number two Let Me reset this number two
[00:16:53] number two number two number two number
[00:16:54] two number two number two number two
[00:16:55] number two number two I uh uh uh um um
[00:16:59] [ __ ] okay dude I got 170 speed on my
[00:17:04] bronia but I have to bench it because my
[00:17:06] Jing Liu is on like 140 speed but for my
[00:17:08] blade I have 170 Bron it's insane it's
[00:17:11] [ __ ] like 174 and my blade is 101 and
[00:17:15] normally you want like 170 for 100 and I
[00:17:17] think if I have over seven uh uh 170
[00:17:21] then I'll like overlap but uh uh my
[00:17:24] Advanced forward action isn't 30% it's
[00:17:25] like 28 cuz my talent's not fully
[00:17:27] leveled so it actually worked out
[00:17:28] anyways doesn't matter no one asked but
[00:17:29] we'll show that later okay welcome to
[00:17:30] the stream um uh let me turn my other
[00:17:33] cam
[00:17:37] on investing his whole life for
[00:17:54] br artifact loadouts aware
[00:17:57] okay
[00:17:59] please don't get me started okay let's
[00:18:01] let's talk about the artifact loadouts
[00:18:04] first of all I've been informed that uh
[00:18:07] they should not even be called loadouts
[00:18:09] so first all let me go through the five
[00:18:11] stages of grief that I went through so
[00:18:13] gon impact this is official they gave us
[00:18:16] where the [ __ ] is the article actually I
[00:18:18] think I liked it let me pull up the
[00:18:20] article uh this okay genin
[00:18:26] impact gen
[00:18:28] genin impact give us this fast equip
[00:18:32] artifacts quick load out and custom load
[00:18:38] out what the f bro bro bro I ain't
[00:18:40] reading
[00:18:42] okay custom main stat set type minor
[00:18:46] affixes that is pretty
[00:18:48] insane looking at this initially I wish
[00:18:50] I was streaming I creamed in my pants I
[00:18:53] had to take them off clean it up get a
[00:18:55] new pair put it on come back keep
[00:18:57] reading
[00:18:59] and that's what I made the first
[00:19:01] tweet oh oh don't open my tail on stream
[00:19:04] okay there could have been there could
[00:19:05] have been could have been COA uh my
[00:19:08] first tweet and asking three years for
[00:19:11] this every
[00:19:15] day and then I realized wait a second
[00:19:18] this looks a little bit more like a fast
[00:19:20] equip and I said you know what that's
[00:19:22] still good that's still
[00:19:25] good that's still good oh emblem boom oh
[00:19:28] oh oh Vermilion boom Oh instructor boom
[00:19:32] but then you realize okay what if you
[00:19:34] want you want what are the points of
[00:19:36] artifact presets why do we want it well
[00:19:38] because my yao yao can go instructor can
[00:19:41] go deepwood can go song of days past can
[00:19:44] go ocean hu clam can go noas oblig can
[00:19:47] go [ __ ] golden troop if you're a
[00:19:50] psychopath sure but if you're doing
[00:19:53] custom loadouts apparently and we don't
[00:19:55] know it's not out but from what we can
[00:19:56] tell here you can only save one build
[00:20:00] which means it'll help you go from build
[00:20:02] one to build two but after that what the
[00:20:04] [ __ ] do you do that rhymed however I
[00:20:07] think because you can save main stats it
[00:20:09] can help because let's say you're
[00:20:11] running like full em kazua no but it can
[00:20:15] help with like changing builds when the
[00:20:17] stats are the same but the sets are
[00:20:18] different like Bennett is always going
[00:20:20] to go the same stats across is like five
[00:20:22] different sets so there is an upside
[00:20:24] where it's it's it's shut up I'm not
[00:20:26] coping there's an upside where it's
[00:20:28] actually like a bit useful but it's not
[00:20:31] the loadouts that we thought that I
[00:20:33] thought they were going to be and
[00:20:34] they're calling them loadouts which is
[00:20:36] upsetting because maybe we won't get
[00:20:37] other loadouts now with that in mind I
[00:20:39] have come to terms with the following
[00:20:41] conclusion these loadouts are our
[00:20:43] loadouts but no for now it's like fast
[00:20:46] equi but they're going to get better
[00:20:47] every patch and version 4.6 and 5.3 will
[00:20:51] have perfect presets true anyways but
[00:20:54] yeah uh we'll see how it is in practice
[00:20:56] but if it's just fast equip I'm kind of
[00:20:58] pissed so we'll see um with that said
[00:21:01] it's a star rail stream we're going to
[00:21:02] keep star railing
[00:21:03] forward but if you didn't see um let me
[00:21:08] put up my second Channel there's a new
[00:21:10] second Channel
[00:21:13] video uh edited by suo himself called

[00:27:54] you you know what I'm going to give you
[00:27:56] the benefit of the doubt maybe I'm dense
[00:27:58] maybe I'm [ __ ] stupid but as far as
[00:28:01] if unless I'm misremembering does I'm
[00:28:04] pretty sure it's [ __ ] E1 just Stacks
[00:28:05] his talent it gives him four and four
[00:28:07] times 2.5 plus four point uh uh uh time
[00:28:10] for crit rate and four times uh uh five
[00:28:12] for crit damage but maybe maybe I'm I'm
[00:28:14] [ __ ] misremembering Dr ratio eidolons
[00:28:17] let me look this up why is there a
[00:28:19] Dextero article whatever I'll just how
[00:28:21] check in game when I get him I mean he
[00:28:23] should be [ __ ] in the mail right now
[00:28:25] wait switch to walking mode let me turn
[00:28:26] that off
[00:28:29] chat if he's not
[00:28:31] here then do not
[00:28:39] fear automatic reply greetings I am
[00:28:43] veritus
[00:28:45] ratio knowledge should flow freely
[00:28:48] between
[00:28:50] people on behalf of
[00:28:53] myself I will deliver upon you questions
[00:28:56] for a one-on-one quiz that takes effect
[00:28:57] upon being
[00:28:59] claimed you're going to ask me about
[00:29:01] technical problems and I shall do my
[00:29:02] utmost to give you a reply before you
[00:29:05] ask remember to establish the best
[00:29:07] practices for intense self- rumination
[00:29:10] or I will intensely self- ruminate
[00:29:13] you Dr
[00:29:16] ratio chat chat do I look like
[00:29:24] chat
[00:29:26] wait
[00:29:34] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[00:29:36] wait wait wait wait wait
[00:29:46] wait
[00:29:51] wait chat do I look
[00:29:54] like do i chat
[00:30:00] do I look like him

[00:30:12] thumbnail okay
[00:30:19] sorry let me turn it back
[00:30:24] off Dr ratio at home
[00:30:35] anyways we got Dr Rael so that is
[00:30:40] exciting wait what is he just
[00:30:46] here wait he actually looks like [ __ ]
[00:30:48] okay
[00:30:50] code the character I he's
[00:30:56] ruined
[00:30:59] dude I [ __ ] um I I pre geared my
[00:31:03] ratio on
[00:31:04] suchai and her ratio is 59 184 but you
[00:31:07] also get crit rate traces uh and more
[00:31:10] crit with this likeon so it's actually a
[00:31:11] lot better than it looks a bathtub like
[00:31:13] his light con so chat can tell I'm not
[00:31:16] posing in a bathtub but thanks for your
[00:31:19] uh input thanks for your
[00:31:22] input thanks for his
[00:31:25] input uh okay so
[00:31:28] I'm being honest in being a hindsight
[00:31:30] hary I should have just pre-formed
[00:31:32] Quantum because it's literally the best
[00:31:33] set for every character in the game
[00:31:34] always and if you disagree you're wrong
[00:31:36] and if you don't use it you're also
[00:31:37] wrong but um we Farm twopiece
[00:31:41] twopiece I farm two piece
[00:31:44] twoie uh I got this piece for my
[00:31:48] head this piece for my uh gloves hands
[00:31:53] feather this no that's topaz this nope
[00:31:56] that's uh
[00:31:59] inor this piece for my um
[00:32:05] body and this nope this nope this piece

[00:32:12] what it is uh ball actually pretty good
[00:32:14] I remember having a good ball where are
[00:32:15] my balls where are my balls where are my
[00:32:17] balls where are my balls there they are
[00:32:19] not bad four speed some crit damage is
[00:32:22] what it is it's not like you know it's
[00:32:23] not you know but it's good enough uh and
[00:32:26] then rope we got

[00:32:46] Good Start how much speed does he need
[00:32:49] okay if I get stop stop stop sorry stop
[00:32:53] asking about speed I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:32:55] speed boots are good in general usually
[00:32:56] just
[00:32:59] 134 is a good number but does it
[00:33:01] actually matter kind of it helps for
[00:33:04] zero cycling memory chos or just getting
[00:33:05] more turns I think uh uh one in four
[00:33:08] Cycles you like don't get another turn
[00:33:11] or some [ __ ] but I'm still learning
[00:33:12] speed stuff but 134 is a good amount to
[00:33:14] go for we're low attack cuz we're level
[00:33:16] one why would you laugh at my attack
[00:33:17] we're level one sorry calm down calm
[00:33:20] down I'm going to wake up my neighbors
[00:33:21] let me drink
[00:33:25] water okay yeah speed is just good in
[00:33:27] general speed is just good in

[00:34:24] claim all um can't lie I kind of hate
[00:34:27] every battle pass lone I like carve it's
[00:34:28] a little bait but I like it today's
[00:34:30] another peaceful day could be good uh if
[00:34:33] we like superimpose it kind of don't
[00:34:35] care about the other ones I'm going be
[00:34:36] real uh this one is very
[00:34:40] COA I mean this one I know is pretty
[00:34:42] good like I know this one's good I know
[00:34:44] it is like I have it already I just
[00:34:45] don't know if I want to superimpose it
[00:34:47] uh usually like getting like in like
[00:34:49] genin I'll get every battle pass weapon
[00:34:50] before I start
[00:34:52] refining
[00:34:55] um
[00:34:58] I mean we'll just get it for now
[00:35:01] whatever oh wait where are my Trace mats
[00:35:05] did they change the battle pass oh yeah
[00:35:08] you get tiar of creams now XD I guess
[00:35:11] okay cool uh I claimed like one thing
[00:35:13] before claiming all some XP books are
[00:35:16] you dumb dude I haven't claimed sorry
[00:35:20] wait it just came out this patch though
[00:35:21] it's not like I'm living in the past
[00:35:22] it's literally this
[00:35:24] patch but yeah I mean these are nice so
[00:35:27] I'm like I'm not complaining like those
[00:35:28] are nice I just uh was startled I was
[00:35:31] Star Struck starships are meant to
[00:35:38] fly the wait was I right about the E1 by
[00:35:41] the way I W it's literally okay calm
[00:35:44] down um traces oh my God everything's
[00:35:47] blue da da da da da da yeah see look
[00:35:53] summation 2.5 five which means E1 is
[00:35:56] four * 2.5 and 4 * 5 which is uh uh uh
[00:36:00] 10 and 20 respectively 10 crit rate 20
[00:36:02] crit damage from an E1 is that true
[00:36:04] summation for Stacks
[00:36:06] uhh yeah so like who the [ __ ] cares I
[00:36:08] mean it's cool wow
[00:36:14] stats bro this guy okay Dr Ra is
[00:36:16] actually [ __ ] Dr yapper the [ __ ] wait
[00:36:19] let me turn my sounds
[00:36:23] out I'll do
[00:36:25] 366
[00:36:27] says
[00:36:28] you okay should I adid him no why
[00:36:35] not in this
[00:36:43] day this really
[00:36:45] good oh ew eight for that but then I get
[00:36:49] crit rate oh I want the crit rate okay
[00:36:50] we'll probably get
[00:36:54] it
[00:36:55] um
[00:37:01] I'm going to level everything
[00:37:02] but I'm just
[00:37:05] rereading his full of attack is really
[00:37:25] cracked was Talent skilled and ALT yeah
[00:37:28] I mean that makes
[00:37:32] sense Talent is the followup attack so
[00:37:34] it should be the most important part of
[00:37:36] his kit right
[00:37:38] yeah but also I mean that's what plus W
[00:37:42] okay that's a disgusting number to add
[00:37:44] 236 to 253 that's 4 + 3 7 + 177% more
[00:37:51] whereas this one is less than 17 which
[00:37:54] means this should be better because
[00:37:55] they're both triggering each time you're
[00:37:56] you're proing fall attack every time you
[00:37:57] skill unless you suck at the game so it
[00:37:59] should be better wait let me do another
[00:38:01] one to see if the math math is out uh
[00:38:04] yeah that's 10% instead of 17 okay yeah
[00:38:06] so that has to be
[00:38:07] better this is
[00:38:10] 10
[00:38:13] okay bad math na math dude is this not
[00:38:19] 17 236 plus 10 is 246 plus 7 is 2
[00:38:24] 253 what did I do wrong
[00:38:46] sorry ABA minus 7
[00:38:53] aboba 8 + 8 is 6
[00:39:01] Sor cuz Every Time We Touch I get this
[00:39:07] feeling great
[00:39:11] um I kind want to level this CU it costs
[00:39:14] nothing but realistically I'm not basic
[00:39:15] attacking on them
[00:39:16] ever uh I'll level skill I really want
[00:39:20] to get this to nine how much tiers oh my
[00:39:22] God 72 oh my God oh my God should I do
[00:39:25] it do I like this guy am I going to
[00:39:27] bench him after one stream chat be
[00:39:28] honest if I'm not going to bench him I
[00:39:30] should get it to nine if I'm going to
[00:39:31] bench him I should throw it it's also
[00:39:32] called Kito erum which means I think
[00:39:34] therefore I am true l w I learned this
[00:39:37] in like ninth
[00:39:45] grade yep benched no he looks like you
[00:39:50] true actually true maybe I'll use him
[00:39:52] because he resembles
[00:39:55] me
[00:39:58] okay chat tell me tell me if this is a
[00:40:00] good take I think doctor ratio tell me
[00:40:03] if this is a good take tell me if this
[00:40:04] is a good take this guy L ratio tell me
[00:40:07] if this is a good take I think Dr ratio
[00:40:09] is a mix of me and okay code it's like
[00:40:12] our child cuz he looks like code but he
[00:40:14] yaps like me true or not true true or
[00:40:16] not true true or not
[00:40:22] true no
[00:40:25] okay
[00:40:33] [Music]
[00:40:35] all right do I care about 8% attack
[00:40:37] what's my attack right now are you guys
[00:40:38] going to KCK W dude we basically have 3K
[00:40:40] attack you guys can't holy [ __ ] wait a
[00:40:42] second why do I have 3K
[00:40:45] attack oh we're on to attack
[00:40:49] still not even 3K k
[00:40:55] w
[00:40:58] his base attack is insane yeah we have a
[00:41:00] lot of [ __ ] attack where is he there
[00:41:03] he
[00:41:04] is I found
[00:41:06] him Envy has 3K dude who dude there's no
[00:41:11] competition between us there's no
[00:41:16] competition highest base attack wait is
[00:41:18] that
[00:41:23] real Hello beautiful people and welcome
[00:41:33] wait what is
[00:41:36] it that's with the like on
[00:41:41] though number 776 wait what the [ __ ]
[00:41:45] wait how much is this guy how much is
[00:41:46] this guy for
[00:41:50] reference wait that's actually so much
[00:41:52] what the [ __ ] for base stack that's so
[00:41:55] much
[00:41:56] damn what if I get his lyone I assume
[00:41:58] his lyone has more
[00:42:00] attack uh where the [ __ ] is
[00:42:02] ratio there he
[00:42:05] is why is he under my
[00:42:07] jingu chat R my jingu
[00:42:13] 2594
[00:42:18] anyways dude no way I'm wasting 72
[00:42:21] [ __ ] tiers that would be so
[00:42:25] stupid
[00:42:29] Every Time We
[00:42:31] Touch okay over 3K attack you can't
[00:42:33] ratio me anymore uh we have dog D ratio
[00:42:36] fully leveled fully geared weapon
[00:42:38] chilling uh this Lyon so okay this Lyon
[00:42:41] was on uh topat and and
[00:42:46] orely
[00:42:47] however a lot of other lyones kind of
[00:42:51] suck dick on him this one's fine only
[00:42:53] silence S5 is fine uh but a lot of other
[00:42:55] lyones I should probably S5 this just so
[00:42:57] that I can show the stats but a lot of
[00:42:58] other like ones kind of suck balls uh so
[00:43:00] let's say you're like oh I have Sword
[00:43:02] Play S5 Sword Play is cracked yes but
[00:43:04] usually give that to your other dude
[00:43:05] give it to like suang or Yan or like
[00:43:07] topaz or yaning or some [ __ ] um and then
[00:43:10] this to him
[00:43:12] anyways pull his bathtub dude I don't
[00:43:15] want the bathtub lyone I don't what I
[00:43:17] don't want
[00:43:21] his I do like the ducky I do like the
[00:43:24] rubber duck
[00:43:35] get it okay but I I [ __ ] calculated
[00:43:37] my entire crit ratio based on my crit
[00:43:40] rate lone and not the crit damage one I
[00:43:42] saw you at the genin concert pogu you
[00:43:44] were so tall I almost true I was very
[00:43:51] tall wait where is
[00:43:55] uh wait what ises my crit ratio wait I
[00:43:57] actually have too much crit rate no I
[00:43:58] don't no I don't wait do I no I don't
[00:44:01] wait do I I get more crit rate through
[00:44:03] this 6 time 2.5 that's 15% crit
[00:44:09] rate no we're actually fine this is
[00:44:11] literally perfect this is literally
[00:44:13] perfect yeah you can get more with this
[00:44:25] but
[00:44:31] yeah we're fine the thing is dude if I
[00:44:33] bench this likee let's say I go for the
[00:44:35] crit damage one I instantly lose 16 crit
[00:44:38] rate which means the max crit rate I
[00:44:40] could have yeah I mean we'd have to go
[00:44:44] for a crit rate
[00:44:46] body do I have a crit rate
[00:44:49] body that has no sub
[00:44:52] stats no I don't see I literally don't I
[00:44:54] literally don't I literally don't no
[00:44:57] we're not going to change my build I'm
[00:44:58] not going to be gearing all stream use
[00:45:00] fushan yeah
[00:45:01] true but
[00:45:06] still remember his crit Trace
[00:45:08] [ __ ] the traces show here unless
[00:45:10] you're talking about the one that gives
[00:45:11] you the the stacks in in battle but we
[00:45:13] already calculated this it's only 2.5 *
[00:45:15] 6 which is like 15% it's not that much
[00:45:18] 55+ 15 that's
[00:45:24] 70 just get it I'm not just getting it
[00:45:28] it's such a waste it's literally a waste
[00:45:30] we'll do one Temple I'll do one Temple
[00:45:32] I'm not pulling for zyon I'm not getting
[00:45:34] his lone we're doing one bu it's not a

[00:47:42] Starlight bro what should I get dude
[00:47:45] okay I know this lonee is bustling I
[00:47:48] also know that the Clara one is
[00:47:52] decent um but I don't need another like
[00:47:55] I I already have this I don't want
[00:47:56] another
[00:47:58] one like I know you could superimpose it
[00:48:00] I know you could use it on a bunch of
[00:48:02] characters maybe a new Harmony what if
[00:48:03] Sparkle uses it who knows how the [ __ ]
[00:48:04] would I know I'm just saying um but
[00:48:09] like the wealth one has a lot of stats
[00:48:11] but when am I ever going to use it dude
[00:48:13] okay hot take but it's not a hot take
[00:48:15] cuz it's a cold take but I'm going to
[00:48:17] say it so extremely that it's going to
[00:48:18] be a hot take I think there's very few
[00:48:21] lones in the game that are better than
[00:48:23] this even five stars I don't care even
[00:48:25] signature l I don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] you
[00:48:27] literally this like code is so [ __ ]
[00:48:29] broken it actually doesn't even make
[00:48:31] sense it like actually doesn't make
[00:48:33] sense it like actually doesn't make
[00:48:34] sense it actually doesn't make sense it
[00:48:36] like actually doesn't make sense so I
[00:48:38] don't know why I would get another like
[00:48:40] [ __ ] nil lone but I guess I could put
[00:48:42] it on like welth but like wow welth okay
[00:48:46] sorry I already have two of this this
[00:48:49] one is [ __ ] I mean I'm not using that
[00:48:51] I mean like I could I don't don't talk

[00:52:18] when I literally you don't understand I
[00:52:20] almost streamed yesterday I swear to God
[00:52:22] this is true by the way I played star
[00:52:23] rail from like 12: midnight till like 6:
[00:52:26] a.m. just gearing I'm not joking I
[00:52:29] didn't even enter combat except maybe
[00:52:30] like once I was literally just gearing
[00:52:33] so I'm not I'm not even joking I'm not
[00:52:35] GNA I'm not joking I'm not going to
[00:52:37] spend that much time regearing my
[00:52:39] [ __ ] characters I'm actually not
[00:52:41] joking I got a 170 something speed BR by
[00:52:44] the way but then I had to undress her
[00:52:46] because uh I needed Jing Liu to be
[00:52:48] faster but for my 101 speed blade uh 170
[00:52:51] like something BR actually works it's uh
[00:52:54] and I it was perfect
[00:53:01] timing [ __ ] what the [ __ ] really yeah
[00:53:03] look look look look look look look look
[00:53:04] look at this
[00:53:06] piece what 11 speed watch this watch
[00:53:09] this watch this watch this are you ready
[00:53:10] and then Fleet of the AG nine speed so
[00:53:13] we have nine plus
[00:53:17] 11 where's the 11 we have nine we have
[00:53:20] 11 that's 20 speed just on these
[00:53:22] planners and if not I have 30 crit
[00:53:23] damage but yeah
[00:53:26] oh yeah also I rolled this piece off
[00:53:27] stream it got 20
[00:53:31] defense which I mean I wanted crit
[00:53:33] damage but uh you know whatever I guess
[00:53:36] I mean that's the worst substat uh it's
[00:53:39] fine for br but if it got crit rate or
[00:53:41] crit damage would have been good on
[00:53:41] other characters and if it got effect
[00:53:43] res it also would have been good on like
[00:53:44] even BR but other characters as well but
[00:53:46] you know defense makes her tanky so what
[00:53:48] yeah F piece sure but you know it is
[00:53:51] what it
[00:53:52] is uh I would have preferred crit damage
[00:53:55] all
[00:53:57] good I don't really care

[01:23:43] points skill on
[01:23:47] veritus 29 60k then we
[01:23:51] Al

[01:25:27] I want everyone to to just look at what
[01:25:29] just happened I need you guys to
[01:25:31] understand actually most of that was
[01:25:32] Silver's break but do ratio does have
[01:25:35] pretty insane
[01:25:37] break look like I should kill jardy here
[01:25:40] but just to show this is how much we're
[01:25:42] doing with Ron May and then our full
[01:25:44] attack also breaks really well so look
[01:25:46] look look look look we hit here then
[01:25:48] let's say silver with tax us right watch
[01:25:51] this
[01:25:54] and then another one so it's like really
[01:25:55] good at helping you
[01:25:58] break I'm pretty sure skill plus fall
[01:26:00] attack is 90 toughness damage the way
[01:26:03] heos these
[01:26:07] okay that's pretty
[01:26:14] cool I know I should have focused jard
[01:26:16] but we're just uh for fun
[01:26:21] gamers you chose the
[01:26:24] wrong will be swept away by the
[01:26:47] wind that was actually dude that was

[01:35:55] I'll probably make another second
[01:35:56] Channel video so we'll go over his build
[01:35:57] because I actually did look into it a
[01:35:59] lot before he came out uh but for the
[01:36:01] record unironically in this team with
[01:36:04] this L cone quantum's the best set I'm
[01:36:06] not even joking I will fight you on this
[01:36:09] but I don't want to talk about that
[01:36:10] right now so uh you can go tvcs four way
[01:36:13] is fine uh it is what it is uh I mean
[01:36:15] that's what we run on our [ __ ] Jing
[01:36:17] so yeah but
[01:36:20] anyways
[01:36:28] mmy okay let's go do maybe memory of
[01:36:34] chaos and then simulated Universe let's
[01:36:36] do both is he gonna play the game
[01:36:39] [ __ ] that's what I just said
[01:36:40] sorry calm down what if we do echo of
[01:36:42] War [ __ ] it let's do echo of war and
[01:36:44] chos cuz this is fun we'll do the the
[01:36:46] weekly boss testing not really a test
[01:36:48] but a fun
[01:36:50] time
[01:36:54] um I think we're g to not use topaz
[01:36:56] because she's
[01:36:59] cheating golden gears I still haven't
[01:37:02] done golden gears I'm mid-run right now
[01:37:04] with jinglu but we could do with
[01:37:11] him use them on pure fiction pure
[01:37:13] fiction is an AOE simulator why would
[01:37:14] you use a Hunt
[01:37:19] character okay I'm going to play this
[01:37:21] team ratio silver wolf Ron May wo
[01:37:29] um
[01:37:36] yeah trickier to
[01:37:43] crack I hate this
[01:37:47] enemy and if you don't hate him you're
[01:37:49] wrong objectively
[01:37:59] whoa
[01:38:01] music fine I'll play The Boss
[01:38:04] music who I just clicked
[01:38:13] return okay on ironically I kind of want
[01:38:15] to use topaz we we going to play a topaz
[01:38:17] team uh I think I could afford silver
[01:38:19] here but I don't know if we're going to
[01:38:19] be skill point hungry do I need to I
[01:38:22] feel like I can make her skill point
[01:38:23] efficient like I know hyper carry topaz
[01:38:24] you spam your skill but I feel like in
[01:38:26] this team with topaz you can just not
[01:38:28] skill that often you only skill to apply
[01:38:29] the mark like I feel like you don't need
[01:38:31] to spam it right
[01:38:36] so topaz ratio yeah wait RM wait really
[01:38:41] is that even enough topaz has
[01:38:43] vulnerability debuff does she have
[01:38:45] another like she has her
[01:38:50] mark no I don't have her sign signature
[01:38:52] is one and idolon okay [ __ ] you actually
[01:38:54] let me VIP use sign genin
[01:39:02] derogatory feels crafter bro use links
[01:39:05] links actually
[01:39:07] cracked yeah so gives an insane amount
[01:39:10] of debuffs like a stupid amount of
[01:39:12] debuffs Ron May is really
[01:39:13] good but we don't really have room for
[01:39:16] her in this
[01:39:20] team
[01:39:22] okay let's go all right weekly balls
[01:39:24] we're going to not that this is
[01:39:26] particularly hard but I feel like doing
[01:39:28] it we implanted
[01:39:37] fire ow
[01:39:43] dude okay we're setting things

[01:41:31] lucky or if it always goes to the same
[01:41:32] one like I know it's usually random but

[01:42:33] genin needs their third
[01:42:48] idolon D okay
[01:42:51] I mean
[01:42:54] true is Dr ratio good or is this just a
[01:42:57] skill issue wait why are you acting like
[01:42:58] this is bad it's a lot of Chip it's a
[01:43:01] lot of like it's like a little damages
[01:43:03] but a lot it adds up it adds up boom and
[01:43:06] then boom and then you have more full
[01:43:07] attacks and when you Al you have more
[01:43:08] you

[01:43:54] my cely and blade okay not going to
[01:43:56] comment on cely for now although I do
[01:43:58] think C is very good because I'm not
[01:44:00] sure but I I think blade is [ __ ]
[01:44:02] broken and people are afraid to admit it
[01:44:04] he's I think he's [ __ ]
[01:44:09] broken
[01:44:11] copium you wait wait till we get our HP

[01:44:29] beautiful in memory cast 12 or you will
[01:44:31] get your money back guarantee that's a
[01:44:33] guarantee we're going to play silver
[01:44:34] wolf Ron
[01:44:36] May
[01:44:40] Lua do I need the extra skill point here
[01:44:43] she uses her skill every three turns uh
[01:44:46] her buff lasts three which means I can
[01:44:48] skill basic basic
[01:44:51] silver wolf uses her skill only if I
[01:44:53] need the implant or if I want the extra
[01:44:56] debuff let's say I use it every two or
[01:44:59] three so here I'm plus
[01:45:02] one here
[01:45:05] I'm let's say neutral here on minus
[01:45:09] one I could afford to run
[01:45:12] wo or or oh that hurt my throat or uh
[01:45:18] Fen which gives crit rate
[01:45:31] I think we're going a ho

[01:46:07] if I want to
[01:46:09] heal like I could go Loa laa is more
[01:46:11] positive
[01:46:14] but I don't actually need to skill on
[01:46:16] her like often and then silver I also
[01:46:19] don't need to Silver I can like it's not
[01:46:21] bad but I don't need to implant anything
[01:46:22] implanting Quantum on CF would be
[01:46:26] nice but I I think we're

[01:48:49] time we're entering here here true
[01:48:57] e watch this watch this watch
[01:49:00] this sniped
[01:49:04] her
[01:49:05] okay uh we're going to do we're going to
[01:49:12] implant yo I low key but very lowkey
[01:49:16] lowkey which I brought Lua here cuz he
[01:49:17] can remove the he can dispill the the
[01:49:19] the they like respawn from the ads they
[01:49:21] summon but it's okay uh do Rao skill
[01:49:27] 100% 74k oo and then Silver's going to
[01:49:30] Al him silver Sil
[01:49:38] Sil
[01:49:49] nice
[01:49:51] 31 64 Al Al no it doesn't matter I mean
[01:49:54] I still find Al
[01:49:57] here nice now we're going to do fall
[01:50:00] attacks alongside our active or whenever
[01:50:02] our other characters hit I'm going to
[01:50:04] alt no reason not
[01:50:09] to it's
[01:50:13] fine easy Clans uh I need to use my
[01:50:16] skill again where our skill points are
[01:50:18] kind of rough right now but it's fine
[01:50:21] this and we e it at someone
[01:50:26] nice it's fine that's fine Stomp all you
[01:50:34] want hey I finally catch a stream AB

[01:50:49] don't care you are as old as boys 14
[01:50:54] years old I am not 14
[01:50:58] boom I really don't want to Al if I
[01:51:00] don't have to but I don't want to lose a
[01:51:03] cycle so I think it's worth alting here
[01:51:04] because silver wolf would not kill him
[01:51:05] this is going to kill him though yep oh
[01:51:08] we just wasted our
[01:51:10] Mark chat was that
[01:51:13] dumb should I just let
[01:51:18] the
[01:51:24] wait but it was either lose the alt or
[01:51:26] minus one
[01:51:28] cycle it was either lose the AL or lose
[01:51:31] the cycle I was [ __ ] regardless but
[01:51:34] maybe I should have save the all I don't
[01:51:35] know we'll see okay we're going to
[01:51:36] implant into CFA
[01:51:37] Quantum we got ice how the [ __ ] do we

[01:51:57] so I can Ron Al before dude calf's about
[01:52:00] to dominate our Ron may watch I alted
[01:52:02] before she got detained before she gets
[01:52:04] dominated so I actually got it off watch
[01:52:06] I'm a God I mean it was silver wolf but
[01:52:07] it would have been smart
[01:52:10] if I almost want to heal myself here I'm
[01:52:13] afraid I'm gonna I'm going to do
[01:52:18] this oh I should have [ __ ] targeted
[01:52:20] silver wolf to cleanse okay doesn't
[01:52:22] matter don't talk to

[01:57:04] El Jing doing five times more damage
[01:57:07] with worst supports okay first of all
[01:57:08] jinglu is broken uh arguably the most
[01:57:10] broken DPS second of all second of all
[01:57:13] second of all that's number one number
[01:57:15] two which which honestly matters even
[01:57:17] more what do you mean worse supports

[01:59:27] entered it y welcome back man
[01:59:34] 35 realistically if I'm trying to be
[01:59:37] turbo optimal I could have kept my
[01:59:38] jingly ALT BR skilled then with the buff
[01:59:41] alted I probably should have done that
[01:59:43] but I don't think it really matters it's
[01:59:44] fine cuz never mind if we don't kill
[01:59:46] here it mattered I will punch my monitor
[01:59:49] I will
[01:59:52] oh okay it's going to matter this isn't
[01:59:55] killing
[02:00:05] whatever 80 crit rate dead how is 80
[02:00:08] crit rate bad so 90 crit rate ratio is
[02:00:12] bad 80 crit raate Dr was
[02:00:16] bad yeah not alting with the Bron buff
[02:00:18] was kind of bad that was on me but we

[02:04:31] did every cely event why do I only have
[02:04:33] one other one did they
[02:04:47] disappear didn't feed them that's not a
[02:04:57] thing forgot to claim I don't think I
[02:04:59] forgot to claim I mean maybe but surely
[02:05:04] not what if we do BR paila and this half
[02:05:09] we play wo first half we play
[02:05:12] fed true or not true
[02:05:17] chat
[02:05:24] Ron okay Ron shouldn't be bench though
[02:05:26] but I mean [ __ ] it R over paila pail is
[02:05:29] the best character in the game no not
[02:05:31] true but I love paila and I don't want
[02:05:32] to venture so [ __ ] you don't talk to
[02:05:34] me I mean we could also just pea first
[02:05:37] half but then we lose debuffs PE only
[02:05:39] gives I
[02:05:40] mean pea gives okay low key paila gives
[02:05:45] one debuff if we play this two debuffs
[02:05:47] if we use E4 and three debuffs if we use
[02:05:51] ultimate so
[02:05:56] technically we get three debuffs from
[02:06:04] there ROM gives debu not really she
[02:06:07] gives one that last two turns and it
[02:06:08] takes you three to four turns to Al so
[02:06:10] it's not really consistent but Romy is
[02:06:13] broken I'm not arguing I'm just saying I
[02:06:14] don't really if any like we just played
[02:06:16] her we don't need to run her again in
[02:06:17] that team we could play her in the Jing
[02:06:19] Leu team like there I mean okay to be
[02:06:21] fair we could just do this like we could
[02:06:23] put her in the second half sure but I
[02:06:26] want to play a ratio Team without Lou
[02:06:46] her that will be interesting not surely
[02:06:50] not I think we'll be fine let's go okay
[02:06:53] we just did remember okay we did okay we
[02:06:56] did first half with who do we have first
[02:06:58] half we had silver Woll for rme now
[02:07:01] we're going to try four star supports T
[02:07:03] pail and uh Pretend This is Lynx it's
[02:07:06] not Lynx so I kind of lied about the
[02:07:09] it's okay we're going to skill we're
[02:07:11] going to no not that
[02:07:15] one okay let's go we'll see if we can
[02:07:19] apply enough debuffs we should be able
[02:07:20] to because of our lone
[02:07:22] um I'm going to do
[02:07:27] this no cleanse okay uh don't talk to me
[02:07:31] don't talk to me we're going to skill
[02:07:33] here
[02:07:38] alt let's got a fush run skill up
[02:07:40] actually no we don't need to because the
[02:07:41] skills already
[02:07:46] up 34 6
[02:07:50] 4 sorry be normal and another full up
[02:07:54] attack right
[02:07:56] here 100K wait that's still the same
[02:07:59] amount and we don't have Ron Okay
[02:08:02] cool so T PE up pretty good how many
[02:08:04] debuffs do we have let's see with the
[02:08:06] these characters we have five debuffs
[02:08:09] which is enough I believe six is the max
[02:08:12] like not it's not the max amount but for
[02:08:13] to Max his passive but at least as long
[02:08:15] as you have at least three it's five to
[02:08:18] Max one passive six Max the other I'm
[02:08:19] pretty
[02:08:20] sure um I'm just going
[02:08:24] basic okay pretty
[02:08:32] good oh I just left P R's [ __ ] field
[02:08:37] expire the 61 is permanent oh then I
[02:08:40] guess it's five Max okay that's
[02:08:47] fair
[02:08:54] okay don't talk to me don't talk to me
[02:08:55] don't talk to me edit that out don't
[02:08:57] talk to me okay we're gonna uh whoa new
[02:09:04] M okay we're going to do memory chos 12
[02:09:07] again uh this time with four star
[02:09:09] supports and pushan because I don't have
[02:09:11] a fourar
[02:09:17] Healer
[02:09:19] you're in trouble manag that wasn't even
[02:09:21] a skill point management issue it's just
[02:09:23] I thought the field of fan lasted
[02:09:24] another turn I didn't see it glowing on
[02:09:26] the ground I wasn't looking I'm not
[02:09:28] paying attention to the [ __ ] flooring
[02:09:30] okay still
[02:09:32] here got so much
[02:09:42] energy
[02:09:45] 64 drop the
[02:09:47] pillar now we're going to do 100k with
[02:09:49] this hit
[02:09:51] 102,000 oh how do he
[02:09:57] know okay we see the flooing uh [ __ ]
[02:10:01] flashing uh I'm going to basic attack
[02:10:05] here nice then we're going to do
[02:10:09] skill bu attack
[02:10:15] easy Haruka think for four months
[02:10:19] appreciate it um I'm just going to skill
[02:10:22] again this should give me enough energy
[02:10:24] as soon as she or he hits
[02:10:26] tun
[02:10:33] no welcome
[02:10:38] customers try alt I think I'm going to
[02:10:42] Al I use this skill to get another
[02:10:45] debuff there although I don't know if we
[02:10:46] need it to how many debuffs does he have
[02:10:48] four yeah only four okay so I'm glad I
[02:10:50] did
[02:10:52] that
[02:10:55] 75 that was maybe a wasted Al but if we
[02:10:58] didn't we would have lost the cycle so
[02:10:59] I'm happy I did that we lost the Alti
[02:11:01] buff but we saved the cycle kind of like
[02:11:03] last [ __ ] memory
[02:11:05] calun
[02:11:07] skill
[02:11:10] skill it's
[02:11:13] fine yeah we need to reapply our debuffs
[02:11:16] going to take a while
[02:11:26] skill before alt wait did I I wasn't
[02:11:36] looking for
[02:11:40] ansers wait why do I have
[02:11:42] like oh I guess I don't have my alts
[02:11:44] like why are my debuff so [ __ ] okay
[02:11:47] we'll hit him
[02:11:56] can my fan move this turn oh my God she
[02:11:58] can't okay yeah this is a disgusting
[02:12:02] run my F's useless right now she's not
[02:12:04] doing anything well I guess she's
[02:12:05] tanking
[02:12:08] but bro can I play I guess we're playing
[02:12:11] against cfco with no Clans this probably
[02:12:13] not the best team in
[02:12:16] hindsight um doesn't matter
[02:12:21] yeah this also doesn't matter what we
[02:12:25] hit I'm asking
[02:12:27] questions I love you
[02:12:29] allus yeah maybe we don't do this with
[02:12:31] no Clans I mean we might be able to do
[02:12:33] it but if we do we
[02:12:36] lucky losing with who what mean we
[02:12:38] didn't have a cleanse the [ __ ] could she
[02:12:40] have done she also is build pretty
[02:12:42] effect res I think we'll do
[02:12:47] um we'll do the exact same team but
[02:12:59] laa p on block CC she was literally
[02:13:03] [ __ ] she was literally [ __ ] uh uh
[02:13:05] contained the whole time or dominated
[02:13:08] whatever it's
[02:13:10] called
[02:13:12] Uh actually maybe BR is just better here
[02:13:16] we could try
[02:13:16] bro
[02:13:38] I think I just do
[02:13:45] this is your skill yeah
[02:13:48] yeah I could have prepped it better but
[02:13:51] it doesn't really
[02:13:54] matter I mean to be fair if I go in with
[02:13:57] no [ __ ] like Lua could get domed here
[02:14:01] as well and then my team will get one
[02:14:07] shot so it's basically the same thing
[02:14:10] but I believe in him more why do I
[02:14:12] believe in him more because I do uh who
[02:14:14] should I focus I'm going to
[02:14:16] focus probably this guy
[02:14:22] actually no I'll hit this guy okay time
[02:14:25] for a
[02:14:26] bug your
[02:14:32] ANW
[02:14:35] me this guy is such a
[02:14:43] yapper what for lra dies
[02:14:46] again
[02:14:53] I actually probably don't want to
[02:14:54] trigger
[02:14:58] that what if I trigger that after
[02:15:00] getting the ult what if I do this and
[02:15:02] then I ult him for death shred and then
[02:15:03] I trigger the P ATT PA
[02:15:14] CH okay not bad actually not bad
[02:15:16] actually not bad uh we're going to Res
[02:15:18] skill here I'm going to Al
[02:15:22] first so far so
[02:15:31] good yeah that wasn't bad we did a 100k
[02:15:34] with the tingyun uh what was it it was
[02:15:36] tingyun paila instead
[02:15:39] but that just cuz our Buffs were better
[02:15:43] used that's fine this is fine get our
[02:15:45] skill points we're going to skill here
[02:15:48] do I have to alt I really yeah I do I
[02:15:51] don't want to [ __ ] I
[02:16:00] mean I think we get it back anyways cuz
[02:16:03] we get energy from like a lot of [ __ ]
[02:16:06] never mind he died okay that was a
[02:16:10] waste I didn't think he died of
[02:16:12] that that's fine
[02:16:16] though f
[02:16:20] askings are Al lra also I could CL
[02:16:24] silver wolf I kind of don't care about
[02:16:26] silver Rolf right
[02:16:29] now yeah I don't think it's
[02:16:32] worth I don't think we're afraid of
[02:16:34] dying here I mean
[02:16:36] maybe but I think I'm fine I think if
[02:16:39] everything goes wrong we could get
[02:16:40] [ __ ] here but I I think 90% of the
[02:16:43] time I think 90% of the
[02:16:46] time
[02:16:48] I think 90% of the time we're
[02:16:51] fine what's this sleep
[02:16:55] chedas bro calm the [ __ ] down okay never
[02:16:59] mind we
[02:17:03] didn't comat needs optim okay ised it's
[02:17:08] fine this is double speed how many
[02:17:10] debuffs do CFA on let's check only three
[02:17:14] all
[02:17:16] good we just applied another
[02:17:18] debuff that did no damage is not
[02:17:22] CR brick run no they're actually fine we
[02:17:25] just waste the cycle actually I don't
[02:17:27] think we yeah we do waste the cycle but
[02:17:30] it's
[02:17:31] fine we don't die here unless they all
[02:17:34] Focus ratio they're focusing
[02:17:38] ratio dude there's no way we die unless
[02:17:41] they all attack
[02:17:44] ratio okay yo what are the yo someone
[02:17:46] math the odds right now someone math the
[02:17:48] odds dude what did they all hit
[02:17:57] him the the five
[02:18:00] hits
[02:18:07] five let's
[02:18:12] win are you struggling we already
[02:18:14] cleared it we cleared it for a try but I
[02:18:16] at least the ratio half but I want to I
[02:18:18] want to I don't know I don't want to use
[02:18:20] that Tobe I use another one although I
[02:18:22] don't think this one is that good to be
[02:18:27] fair that's
[02:18:35] fine
[02:18:38] okay
[02:18:43] okay I think I'm going to
[02:18:45] not attack this enemy at
[02:18:48] all until I reduces defense with uh
[02:18:51] silver wolf so that I'm not wasting the
[02:18:53] full of attacks from Dr Rao's Al I don't
[02:18:55] know if that's five head or zero
[02:18:59] head I don't
[02:19:01] know it's either five head or negative
[02:19:03] head how many debuffs does he have six I
[02:19:05] don't need to apply more so we're going
[02:19:06] to basic attack no skill oh I'm a genius
[02:19:10] we're going to skill this guy ult the
[02:19:13] middle dude reduces defense trigger
[02:19:16] ratios follow attack
[02:19:22] skill
[02:19:24] pack tun basic is going to Pro the full
[02:19:27] he's dead Mama
[02:19:29] Mia he's a genius he's just a genius
[02:19:31] like he's literally just a
[02:19:37] genius if you kill my te you I okay
[02:19:40] thank you
[02:19:42] lra
[02:19:43] okay um alting on lra seems dumb here so
[02:19:47] we're not going to Skilling on silver
[02:19:49] wolf seems ideal Skilling on ratio seems
[02:19:55] necessary and now I believe that if I
[02:19:58] alt I could clear in a cycle I could I
[02:20:01] could save this cycle if I alt or I
[02:20:04] could save my alt and clear next cycle
[02:20:06] it's a lose lose either way I think I
[02:20:07] should save my ALT for CFA
[02:20:11] personally thing I am recording
[02:20:13] something currently I will watch what
[02:20:15] you sent after this but hello welcome to
[02:20:17] the Stream
[02:20:19] let me use my skill on ratio I don't
[02:20:22] think it's worth alting okay if I Al I
[02:20:25] say a cycle but then Kafka [ __ ] me do I
[02:20:27] want CFA to [ __ ]
[02:20:29] me yes but
[02:20:32] I what do you think
[02:20:36] chat I think it's not worth alting I
[02:20:40] mean maybe it is it actually might be
[02:20:41] cuz T also gives us
[02:20:43] energy no but we need to skill cuz we
[02:20:45] only kill him if we Al and basic on
[02:20:47] okay this is my theory we only kill him
[02:20:50] if we Al and then basic onun to trigger
[02:20:52] a fall of attack but it's not worth cuz
[02:20:54] our skill is has no off time right now
[02:20:56] there's zero out of three so I think we
[02:20:57] need to skill I think we let the cycle
[02:20:58] go it is what it is it is what it is
[02:21:01] unless silver wolf literally dies here
[02:21:03] you chose The Wrong Enemy yeah this is
[02:21:05] fine let's build our skill points let's
[02:21:07] just have a good
[02:21:09] time party rockers in the house tonight
[02:21:14] everybody just have a good time
[02:21:19] if this guy doesn't die the py okay yo
[02:21:22] why is he not about to die bro what
[02:21:26] party rockers in the house
[02:21:30] tonight everybody just have listen I
[02:21:33] made the wrong decision I should have
[02:21:35] just aled it's
[02:21:38] fine it's
[02:21:40] fine I don't know why I didn't T you Al
[02:21:42] there either actually I should T aled
[02:21:45] this is going terrible this this is
[02:21:47] going terrible it's still going to clear
[02:21:49] but I listen let this be a lesson in no
[02:21:52] dude sometimes in life things don't go
[02:21:54] your way okay but that's fine things
[02:21:57] don't always go your way and that's okay
[02:22:00] let just be a lesson that's fine you
[02:22:02] have to improvise you have to adapt and
[02:22:04] you have to overcome and that's what
[02:22:06] we're doing right
[02:22:07] now 64 we're about to do way more watch
[02:22:10] this imp plant please okay that's good
[02:22:15] that's fine that's fine
[02:22:18] you
[02:22:20] [ __ ] I'm not going to use my skill and
[02:22:22] going to
[02:22:26] attack okay uh I'm going to be greedy
[02:22:30] I'm going to first Al
[02:22:31] on I meant to say doctor ratio we're
[02:22:34] still buffed by tingyun the enemy should
[02:22:36] still be debuffed if I press Z seven
[02:22:38] debuffs so the AL tier should be
[02:22:41] good we're going to Al going to do some
[02:22:43] damage now we're going to launch a
[02:22:45] followup attack I could cleanse myself
[02:22:47] silver wolf if I want to be safe but I'd
[02:22:49] rather be sorry than being
[02:22:51] safe this is probably really dumb but
[02:22:54] this helps me break Kafka I should
[02:22:57] probably just cleanse I'm not going to
[02:22:59] cleanse we're gonna do
[02:23:01] this okay now we're going to skill P
[02:23:07] attack [ __ ] okay it is what it is
[02:23:12] uh it's
[02:23:15] fine I could just cleans my silver wolf
[02:23:19] probably should have it's fine buff him
[02:23:21] again only get hit once here well twice
[02:23:24] that's fine we don't die easy easy
[02:23:29] easy and then we launch a full attack Dr
[02:23:31] Rachel how much how much how much 64k
[02:23:35] 89 not
[02:23:41] bad 41 oh I didn't crit 32 no crit
[02:23:45] no no oh we did crit that would have
[02:23:48] been over 100 I promise that would have
[02:23:49] been over
[02:23:50] 100 wait should I have killed Kafka I
[02:23:52] don't want to use my ALT mark on her
[02:23:53] though it felt
[02:23:56] wasted it actually felt wasted to do
[02:23:58] that uh I think this was smart if I
[02:24:00] don't die it was smart I might die if I
[02:24:02] die it wasn't smart but if I don't die I
[02:24:04] think this is a play and we should
[02:24:06] weakness break here yeah we break him
[02:24:07] watch
[02:24:08] this watch this 100K follow attack
[02:24:11] damage or your money back
[02:24:13] guaranteed 86 okay money back guaranteed
[02:24:16] uh we're going to basic
[02:24:17] just basic matter it's
[02:24:21] fine yep cf's dead okay watch
[02:24:25] this
[02:24:30] who
[02:24:32] Rael 39 crit crit crit crit 86 okay
[02:24:35] we're always doing 86 all we
[02:24:42] wi
[02:24:45] nice when simul ated Universe buff does
[02:24:48] more than
[02:24:49] ratio
[02:24:56] okay okay phase two Jing L time we
[02:24:59] better get our revenge if I die I will
[02:25:01] scream and shout and let it all out
[02:25:06] going do this Ron may you don't need to
[02:25:07] use your skill you can just do
[02:25:10] that
[02:25:15] swep uh
[02:25:20] skill do our skill again we're not going
[02:25:23] to Al though till Bron Buffs us
[02:25:26] BR now we Al all will be
[02:25:33] revealed nice
[02:25:36] 186
[02:25:41] okay uh I'm actually GNA heal because
[02:25:44] I'm afraid and I don't like being afraid
[02:25:47] so I'm going to
[02:25:52] heal
[02:25:55] uh we're
[02:25:58] gonna okay quick skill point calculation
[02:26:01] minus one
[02:26:04] then no we can't skill
[02:26:07] [ __ ] that's fine we just basic that's
[02:26:10] fine still have a turn doesn't matter we
[02:26:12] don't actually need
[02:26:13] to there's literally no reason to skill
[02:26:16] we have a turn but I kind of wanted
[02:26:17] energy but it's fine we have po so we
[02:26:19] should still get our Al in three turns
[02:26:22] skill skill
[02:26:26] again that's really good minus one cycle
[02:26:29] but uh it is what it
[02:26:30] is Boom run me
[02:26:34] skill
[02:26:38] drink I really don't want to ult when
[02:26:41] I'm not BR buffed but if I don't ult I
[02:26:43] lose energy what's more important to me
[02:26:44] energy or damage
[02:26:49] I think I Al I think I cuz I want to get
[02:26:52] my Al back as much as possible I think
[02:26:53] it's worth alting Ria buff is not like
[02:26:55] that much I mean it is but it's
[02:27:02] fine nice oh okay that's fine that's
[02:27:10] fine that's also
[02:27:13] fine I'm scared now if any of them hit
[02:27:16] Ron May no how she's one energy offer Al
[02:27:18] if any of them hit rade I could aled I
[02:27:20] can't it's oh wait what
[02:27:22] the no I knew that was going to happen I
[02:27:24] knew she was going to all get her alt
[02:27:25] when a turn started I knew that I knew
[02:27:27] that I knew that was going to
[02:27:32] happen I knew that going to happen yo yo
[02:27:34] don't yo [ __ ] yo we're fine it's only
[02:27:37] myosis we're fine oh my God we're on

[02:27:47] skill here I cleanse the wind chear
[02:27:49] right I cleanse this right I don't die
[02:27:53] because if I go again I die but if I
[02:27:55] cleanse it I don't
[02:27:56] die so in theory
[02:28:00] okay okay thank God I just wanted to
[02:28:03] make sure we actually cleansed um
[02:28:07] however I might still die to the ad now
[02:28:09] that I think about it cuz our wo is in
[02:28:11] like four turns I should have skilled My
[02:28:15] Wo if I die here this is going to be
[02:28:17] very uh
[02:28:20] tragic all will be revealed oh I should
[02:28:22] have enter my stance first did I not
[02:28:24] okay it's
[02:28:25] over I'm stupid
[02:28:30] well I didn't mean to I mean we're on 30
[02:28:33] crit raate if we crit it doesn't matter
[02:28:35] if we crit it's fine okay we didn't crit
[02:28:37] we actually just die there's literally
[02:28:39] no way we don't die I'm going to hit
[02:28:40] here to try to kill the little
[02:28:45] ones oh it work worked okay we're fine
[02:28:48] okay we're fine the only thing I [ __ ]
[02:28:49] up was I shouldn't have Jing I don't
[02:28:51] have a skill point it's fine I just
[02:28:54] should have jingly you aled that's the
[02:28:55] only thing I [ __ ] up
[02:28:59] um well there's a one in four chance I
[02:29:02] know that's not exactly how it works
[02:29:04] but oh no we're fine okay we're always
[02:29:07] fine uh I'm actually just going to do
[02:29:08] this not going to risk it we're fine
[02:29:10] literally no way we die now we're
[02:29:11] actually just
[02:29:13] fine all right easy I just I [ __ ] up
[02:29:15] the the jingle El I feel bad about that
[02:29:18] but it's fine we should still get this
[02:29:20] this should
[02:29:21] kill I mean yeah
[02:29:25] okay
[02:29:30] okay it's fine that's I just Ed before
[02:29:34] turn I want to scream I keep pressing
[02:29:37] buttons that shine I keep pressing
[02:29:39] buttons dude it's like you don't have
[02:29:41] time to think you don't have time to
[02:29:44] think there is no reason reason to press
[02:29:47] alt here there was no reason to can I
[02:29:49] cancel dude let me cancel why can't you
[02:29:51] cancel alt I see the alt I pressed the
[02:29:54] alt okay for let this be a learning
[02:29:56] moment in case you're wondering you
[02:29:57] don't want a Ron May alt right before
[02:29:59] her turn starts because her alt it it uh
[02:30:02] it ticks down each start of her turn
[02:30:05] okay it lasts for two turns the field of
[02:30:07] duration decreases by the start uh one
[02:30:09] at the start of her turn so we would
[02:30:10] have effectively had another turn of her
[02:30:12] up time if I just waited for her turn to
[02:30:14] start and then I aled unfortunately I
[02:30:17] did because I saw a shiny button and I
[02:30:19] clicked it this was dumb it was stupid
[02:30:23] please don't do make the same mistake I
[02:30:25] did and quite
[02:30:29] frankly I don't want to talk I don't
[02:30:31] want to talk I don't want to talk I
[02:30:33] don't I don't want to talk I don't want
[02:30:35] to
[02:30:41] talk and my BR is before dude how is
[02:30:44] dude how is any of this even
[02:30:47] imposs honestly I hope I lose this run I
[02:30:50] don't even want to heal just kill me
[02:30:51] just kill me at this point just [ __ ]
[02:30:52] kill me at this point just kill
[02:30:57] me just kill me I don't even want to
[02:31:05] live yo are they just going to attack
[02:31:13] her we've entered the storm
[02:31:18] okay there's definitely a correct play
[02:31:20] in this
[02:31:21] situation so if I want to do as much
[02:31:23] damage as possible I skill jinglu and I
[02:31:26] use everything however I actually think
[02:31:28] Skilling wo cleansing Ron May and then
[02:31:31] Ron Skilling is probably the best is the
[02:31:34] way to not
[02:31:41] die I don't want to I don't have
[02:31:45] to
[02:31:47] a decisive moment in the
[02:31:52] battle I mean actually at the start of
[02:31:54] her turn let me
[02:32:01] see this has two turns
[02:32:09] left boho Talent yeah but romme goes
[02:32:15] first or does it trigger passively wait
[02:32:17] I actually forget when it triggers wait
[02:32:19] when the [ __ ] does it
[02:32:30] trigger when I
[02:32:39] heals
[02:32:41] okay I have
[02:32:44] faith we don't have Ron maze buff here
[02:32:47] though that's
[02:32:51] fine all will be R I think we're
[02:32:57] fine I'm also going to attack this guy
[02:33:00] just to make sure we kill the ads just
[02:33:01] to avoid
[02:33:03] dying just to avoid any potential
[02:33:06] mistakes because now there's no chance
[02:33:08] we
[02:33:11] die we're going to do
[02:33:15] this don't we don't die there's no
[02:33:17] there's no chance we die know this is
[02:33:19] fine the only downside is our Ron buff
[02:33:21] wasn't active for our Jing Le's
[02:33:24] turn
[02:33:25] um this is a fine alt cuz Ron turns in a
[02:33:29] while so this is good now it's Bron for
[02:33:32] some reason my Bron is before my Jing I
[02:33:33] could basic and wrap
[02:33:35] around
[02:33:39] um did I [ __ ] up my speed
[02:33:45] tuning
[02:33:47] moment in the
[02:33:49] battle yeah I'm just going to basic
[02:33:51] we'll wrap around sure
[02:33:54] work that's fine this is fine there's no
[02:33:57] chance we lose there's actually no
[02:33:58] chance we lose now okay we
[02:34:04] win I didn't need to Al this early but
[02:34:06] it doesn't really matter cuz we're
[02:34:07] killing before the alt expires anyways
[02:34:09] it does not matter there's literally
[02:34:10] zero chance we lose if we lose I'll gift
[02:34:13] as many Subs as you want literally
[02:34:15] Unlimited
[02:34:16] unlimited Subs there's no chance we lose
[02:34:18] watch boom still here all GG it's over
[02:34:21] over I literally yeah 275
[02:34:24] GG
[02:34:28] okay
[02:34:31] okay that was unnecessarily scary it
[02:34:34] shouldn't have it shouldn't have been
[02:34:36] but we did
[02:34:38] it another 12 clear don't a for the 14th
[02:34:41] month finina fan this still 14 months
[02:34:43] not don't Dr ratioa H not
[02:34:49] donalt not
[02:34:53] Donal not
[02:34:57] donalt
[02:35:02] balls um anyways second half doesn't
[02:35:04] matter we're just trying to maybe I
[02:35:05] should play another I I haven't tried
[02:35:07] topaz right although these enemies
[02:35:08] aren't fire weak but we could do
[02:35:12] topaz probably silver wolf like I mean
[02:35:16] definitely so I don't even think it's
[02:35:17] close we can do topaz silver wolf Lua if
[02:35:20] we need skill points and then second
[02:35:22] half doesn't like we're not playing for
[02:35:23] the second half uh we don't have to do
[02:35:25] it if we don't want to so
[02:35:33] yeah m is B yeah we'll go do other stuff
[02:35:37] but I just want to make sure these teams
[02:35:38] work like this is the only place you
[02:35:39] could really test it is ratio still on
[02:35:41] boat no I think he's on his signature I
[02:35:43] mean I can't check
[02:35:44] anymore hey you hey

[02:39:47] I'll save
[02:39:52] it yo I'm asking questions I think the
[02:39:56] the the raid should I kill

[02:40:02] here actually this guy's like no debuffs
[02:40:04] but oh I could skill here and the fall
[02:40:06] attack will jump here cuz those enemies
[02:40:08] die watch this if you skill here 100%
[02:40:10] chance to fall attack but it won't go to
[02:40:12] him cuz he's dead and it won't go to
[02:40:13] these enemies cuz they they go away so
[02:40:15] it's going to go here watch watch
[02:40:19] watch true he's a
[02:40:24] genius I
[02:40:26] have skill and an
[02:40:31] ALT Bro think he's
[02:40:35] smart all

[02:41:13] get a skill point we're going to implant
[02:41:14] Quantum into AF yep uh should I skill

[02:41:21] enough skill points so we're going to do
[02:41:24] it also get alet is
[02:41:32] unct skill
[02:41:36] here
[02:41:38] nice almost have dror ratio's Al we're a
[02:41:41] little bit
[02:41:43] offat uh almost broke her weakness as
[02:41:49] well can you stop focusing my silver
[02:41:52] wolf I think alting here is smart so
[02:41:54] we're going to Al
[02:41:57] here nice follow attack as soon as I hit
[02:42:00] on Lua which I am about to should I Al H
[02:42:03] I think it's worth saving it for my
[02:42:05] Fields
[02:42:06] expired which should be very soon nice
[02:42:08] damage 80 field expired so we're going
[02:42:10] to Al oh my the
[02:42:14] combo good
[02:42:17] combo um I think silver wolf should we
[02:42:20] just going to attack I probably could
[02:42:21] attack the other dude for a bug time for
[02:42:23] a bug it's fine save some skill points
[02:42:25] cuz might as well could have skilled
[02:42:27] there on topaz
[02:42:28] though nice damage nice damage nice
[02:42:33] damage I think we kill Kafka
[02:42:36] here that's fine I don't think I need to
[02:42:39] skill on the ultra so we're not going
[02:42:41] to how many deff does you have nine so
[02:42:44] we're going to attack this guy can I
[02:42:46] afford to skill I think I can we're
[02:42:47] going to skill time for a bug uh I'm
[02:42:51] also going to skill again we're going to
[02:42:52] use all our skill points
[02:42:53] offensively nice
[02:42:56] go wait why am I low HP okay maybe I
[02:42:59] should have healed oh she didn't die I
[02:43:02] didn't crit why did she die please don't
[02:43:04] kill me she didn't die that's I didn't
[02:43:06] crit I didn't crit I didn't crit I
[02:43:08] didn't how is that my fault there's
[02:43:09] literally a 90% chance that was the good
[02:43:11] play there was a 90% chance we win how
[02:43:15] is that my
[02:43:22] fault bro could have just healed I could
[02:43:36] have there was a 90% chance we just
[02:43:40] killed Kafka there and instead we did
[02:43:44] it
[02:43:46] wow I wonder what character passively
[02:43:48] gains gives 10% crit rate that starts
[02:43:51] with an f and ends with
[02:43:57] Yen fine fine I'll play fuks
[02:44:02] Win fan well player
[02:44:09] playan but this
[02:44:14] is
[02:44:24] Pepe W
[02:44:37] team I am on ageless
[02:44:44] though
[02:44:52] fine if that lone and that build
[02:45:00] yeah quartum set would be good in this
[02:45:09] team you learn to know yourself before
[02:45:12] your enemy you learn to know yourself
[02:45:15] yeah we're going to skill we're going to
[02:45:17] skill we going to
[02:45:25] skill okay I don't want to do this
[02:45:27] anymore so we'll just do this one and
[02:45:28] then we'll get out because I've done
[02:45:29] like [ __ ] four already uh this I
[02:45:34] think I'm just going to use every
[02:45:35] [ __ ] skill except
[02:45:39] hers is
[02:45:43] unpri Chad stop counting
[02:46:10] thisat yeah they're all
[02:46:14] fine
[02:46:16] I I can love her
[02:46:26] ult kind of don't want to Al this guy
[02:46:29] because it feels like he's gonna die
[02:46:30] soon actually no it's still worth
[02:46:38] it hindsight maybe it
[02:46:40] wasn't I should aled the
[02:46:44] horse
[02:46:47] uh how many debu yeah let's go yeah I
[02:46:50] probably should the horse Okay mod you
[02:46:52] have permission to two week or a month
[02:46:54] ban anyone that counts starting in 10
[02:46:57] seconds it's up to you you don't have to
[02:46:59] I actually don't mind it but I'm just
[02:47:01] saying you have
[02:47:03] permission just because Star Chat is
[02:47:06] usually ass now it's extra
[02:47:12] ass ah I think we just bam Basics I
[02:47:16] don't think this matters I probably
[02:47:17] should have altered this guy though I
[02:47:18] wonder if it would have saved us
[02:47:21] anything I'm going to reset my Fields
[02:47:23] before Kafka comes out going to
[02:47:27] skill okay all right CFA time we should
[02:47:31] be fine there's literally no way she
[02:47:32] [ __ ] dominates
[02:47:34] us I don't have skill points though but
[02:47:37] I'm going to skill here I think this
[02:47:38] one's worth it I think this is worth
[02:47:43] it I also think this is fine although
[02:47:47] Skilling would have been really nice
[02:47:51] there oh yeah I didn't get the skill
[02:47:59] there
[02:48:02] fine I get the skill on topaz actually
[02:48:05] it's fine num me goes and then I go on
[02:48:06] topaz and then I'll skill alt so this
[02:48:08] works
[02:48:12] out yeah that's good CH break oh my God
[02:48:15] the break you took the wait good break
[02:48:18] okay then we uh do I even need more
[02:48:20] debuff on her I think she has like yeah
[02:48:21] she has nine I'm going to do this then
[02:48:23] I'm going to still
[02:48:36] here uh I'll
[02:48:41] basic okay nice 81 and then
[02:48:46] nummy it's fine that's
[02:48:50] fine yin and yang both of
[02:49:02] them it's
[02:49:09] fine
[02:49:11] okay a okay we're going to skill yet
[02:49:16] magic
[02:49:23] 40 nice we got the effector that's what
[02:49:26] we
[02:49:27] wanted thank you f um okay what is the
[02:49:31] best play here I think we silver wolf Al
[02:49:33] I don't know if I need to Silver Al uh
[02:49:36] silver wolf Al CFA actually it's about
[02:49:39] to it's not expired yet so I don't think
[02:49:40] we do it yet I think we
[02:49:42] do skill here no I think
[02:49:46] we I think we basic here I think we
[02:49:49] skill
[02:49:51] here this killed
[02:49:55] Kafka this kills
[02:49:57] Kafka never mind alt optimizing no I
[02:50:02] adult other [ __ ] [ __ ] I clicked I
[02:50:04] swear I clicked I clicked here game bug
[02:50:07] it doesn't matter it actually doesn't
[02:50:08] matter I clicked on this guy by the way
[02:50:10] though I did click on that
[02:50:12] guy although it's fine
[02:50:29] yeah I should aled the other dude it's
[02:50:31] okay
[02:50:38] um kind of don't want to attack afka
[02:50:40] anymore oh I hit her in the I hit her in
[02:50:43] the jumps this guy
[02:50:45] never mind it didn't kill him um oh [ __ ]
[02:50:48] I should
[02:50:50] aled it was
[02:50:53] fine
[02:50:55] alt
[02:51:04] alt okay okay and then that should
[02:51:06] triggered again nice energy not dead
[02:51:09] though
[02:51:10] s minus one cycle it's
[02:51:13] fine quick
[02:51:24] divination you die I don't feel like
[02:51:26] doing this
[02:51:29] anymore yeah silver wol alting him would
[02:51:31] have reduce his defense a lot so kind of
[02:51:33] sad that I didn't get to do that it's
[02:51:39] fine all
[02:51:42] things creation
[02:51:50] okay if he doesn't die here H 100
[02:51:53] gifted okay he's dead
[02:51:55] nice that was okay the other team
[02:51:58] performed better here that's not
[02:52:00] necessarily meeting the teams better I
[02:52:01] think him with uh to actually we have 25
[02:52:03] we're fine I think him with topaz is
[02:52:05] good it's just the other one felt a bit
[02:52:06] better there equ Quantum set no like
[02:52:08] Quantum set's good but it's not that big
[02:52:10] of a deal like it's just
[02:52:13] subsets and Quantum sets on Jing I don't
[02:52:16] want to remove her
[02:52:21] gear okay POG uh I'm gonna BRB I have to
[02:52:26] pee um we'll probably go do something
[02:52:29] interactive that's not memory of chaos
[02:52:31] cuz memory chaos sucks but in the
[02:52:33] meantime while I pee let's Auto Battle
[02:52:35] something so that we have something to
[02:52:37] do I'm going to Auto Battle the weekly
[02:52:38] boss because it takes a while um
[02:52:42] hopefully doctor ratio on auto can clear
[02:52:44] the the weekly boss if he can't that is
[02:52:47] concerning but it should be
[02:52:50] fine it should be fine so let me be
[02:53:13] be
[02:53:29] all will be swept away by the
[02:53:43] wind
[02:54:02] this is dou
[02:54:09] speed me
[02:54:13] Tru
[02:54:25] Eternal all will be swept away by the
[02:54:43] wind
[02:56:23] is this thing
[02:56:25] on
[02:56:27] um um can you can you hear me um
[02:56:33] hello excuse
[02:56:38] me
[02:56:40] ex excuse
[02:56:43] me
[02:56:48] hello sorry for the year of memory of
[02:56:50] chaos chap that show was boring but I
[02:56:52] have to do it because the only place I
[02:56:53] can showcase a
[02:56:57] character Bas
[02:57:02] Fang ratio did 163k on auto AI better
[02:57:06] than you wait is that actually
[02:57:13] true
[02:57:16] ain't no
[02:57:24] way okay I'll write that down that's
[02:57:26] [ __ ] funny no way Auto is better than
[02:57:29] me ain't no
[02:57:32] way all right anyways uh chat we're
[02:57:35] going to do some fun stuff now um I
[02:57:38] don't know what that means though oh
[02:57:40] should we talk about his build and stuff
[02:57:41] should I just get this out of the way I
[02:57:43] kind of don't want to maybe I should
[02:57:45] wait till later maybe I
[02:57:54] should no yes relics okay we'll talk
[02:57:58] about everything just to get out of the
[02:58:00] way because we played the game but we'll
[02:58:04] so now I can actually talk about them
[02:58:05] okay we're going to talk about them
[02:58:09] quickly we'll talk about them quickly
[02:58:11] and then we'll simulate Universe okay
[02:58:13] okay
[02:58:14] so doct ratio here's what you need to
[02:58:17] know first of all for 2.0 Characters
[02:58:20] just by the way chat for 2.0 Characters
[02:58:22] Sparkle and Black Swan I will make a
[02:58:25] full guide on my YouTube main Channel
[02:58:27] we're going back to it but for now I'm
[02:58:28] still you know casually playing so Dr Ra
[02:58:32] show here's what you need to know after
[02:58:33] playing him first of all he basically
[02:58:36] just he will spam fall attacks and do a
[02:58:39] consistent amount of damage he's hunt
[02:58:41] which means mostly single Target but his
[02:58:43] fall attacks can kind of Bounce uh
[02:58:45] between enemies if you kill one so what
[02:58:47] I mean is the following you skill and
[02:58:49] then it basically will be guaranteed to
[02:58:50] do a followup attack it's not
[02:58:51] technically guaranteed it's 40% chance
[02:58:53] but then it gains 20% chance for each
[02:58:54] debuff the enemy has meaning that if the
[02:58:56] enemy has three debuffs it's guaranteed
[02:58:58] to full attack now you're almost always
[02:59:01] going to have this if you play and build
[02:59:02] a team correctly which is easy first of
[02:59:05] all Dr Rachel himself applies one debuff
[02:59:07] to an enemy with uh this right here
[02:59:10] where you skill effect res uh it's not
[02:59:12] 100% chance 100% base chance which means
[02:59:13] you need I think 67 EHR well you don't
[02:59:16] want to build EHR on him but that's what
[02:59:18] you would need to 100% it it's fine if
[02:59:19] you like you want to build damage still
[02:59:21] cuz he's a DPS but eventually like you
[02:59:23] will get this effect res reduced which
[02:59:24] is one debuff and then you'll run
[02:59:25] supports that have way more debuffs
[02:59:27] you'll get way more than three but with
[02:59:29] three you have 100% chance to fall up
[02:59:31] attack which is the mo uh majority of
[02:59:33] your damage or a big chunk at least it
[02:59:35] does it has a way higher Skilling for
[02:59:37] reference than a skill so every time you
[02:59:38] skill fall attack a single Target now if
[02:59:41] you skill and the enemy you're attacking
[02:59:43] dies it will full up attack a random
[02:59:44] other enemy which is good because it
[02:59:47] kind of alleviates his single Target
[02:59:49] because let's say you kill one it'll
[02:59:51] then kill the other with your followup
[02:59:52] attack or hit the other instead of just
[02:59:54] it being wasted ultimate drops a pillar
[02:59:57] on
[02:59:59] enemies EHR does not affect his talent
[03:00:02] wait what are you talking about I'm
[03:00:03] talking about this not the talent did I
[03:00:06] misspeak I'm talking about this this
[03:00:08] skill it's you don't want to build EHR
[03:00:10] but for reference this 100% base chance
[03:00:12] does uh is a affected by
[03:00:17] EHR anyways do some info I'll check it
[03:00:22] after ultimate applies a mark and then
[03:00:25] anytime an ally hits it does single
[03:00:26] Target damage whatever and then anytime
[03:00:28] an ally hits up to two times the next
[03:00:30] two times your ally hits uh it'll shoot
[03:00:32] a full up attack which is nice and his
[03:00:34] weakness break is [ __ ] insane by the
[03:00:36] way his skill plus full up attack
[03:00:38] together does 90 toughness damage or
[03:00:41] whatever it's called and then you could
[03:00:42] also use Ron May for more or just in
[03:00:44] general it's is really good ultimate
[03:00:46] also will let you full with attack
[03:00:47] passively uh he also has some passives
[03:00:50] that are very important to build around
[03:00:52] this one
[03:00:53] deduction and summation both of these
[03:00:56] give you buff Buffs based on how many
[03:00:58] debuffs the enemy has uh because of this
[03:01:01] here's what you need to know okay first
[03:01:03] of all if you have five debuffs uh let's
[03:01:06] start here if you have actually no let's
[03:01:07] start here if you have five debuffs you
[03:01:10] get 50% damage bonus if you have three
[03:01:12] debuffs you get 30% damage bonus if you
[03:01:14] have less than three you don't get any
[03:01:15] so you want at least three debuffs
[03:01:17] minimum ideally five or six because of
[03:01:20] this but we'll get there later but if
[03:01:21] you have five 50% damage bonus which is
[03:01:24] huge uh to that Target by Dr ratio three
[03:01:27] is the minimum for 30% now for this
[03:01:29] other Talent basically uh however much
[03:01:32] debuffs the enemy has when you use your
[03:01:34] skill you will gain crit rate and crit
[03:01:36] damage now for my understanding you
[03:01:39] don't actually need six debuffs uh uh up
[03:01:41] at the at the same time right or like
[03:01:45] you only need to proc this once because
[03:01:46] you gain actually how does uptime work
[03:01:49] wait let me test this wait wait wait
[03:01:50] wait let me test
[03:01:52] it permanent are we
[03:01:55] sure stackable yeah okay okay yeah it's
[03:01:59] permanent but let me apply like a bug or
[03:02:03] some [ __ ] one
[03:02:07] debuff let me just make sure I mean I
[03:02:09] could just cut this out it's no big
[03:02:11] deal so that should have gave me one
[03:02:14] crit raid buff yeah oh yeah it shows at
[03:02:16] bottom left there's a stack okay yeah
[03:02:18] yeah and then if I do this how many
[03:02:21] debuffs is that four so now I should go
[03:02:23] to Five let me see just make this should
[03:02:26] work but let's just make sure yeah five
[03:02:28] okay and then let me check my crit raate
[03:02:30] to make
[03:02:31] sure can I open the can I open the can
[03:02:39] I uh yeah we're at 87.7 okay so we do
[03:02:42] have five okay so it stacks
[03:02:49] cool yeah so update this Talent does
[03:02:51] stack which means you don't actually
[03:02:52] need six different debuffs uh because if
[03:02:54] you use it against enemy that has two
[03:02:55] debuffs and then four debuffs or three
[03:02:57] and then three or whatever the [ __ ]
[03:02:58] you'll get six Stacks so it's very easy
[03:03:00] but basically five debuffs is ideal you
[03:03:02] get 50% damage bonus at least three for
[03:03:04] 30% outside of that not much else uh
[03:03:07] keep in mind you get a lot of crit rate
[03:03:08] through your traces and you also get an
[03:03:10] additional uh up to what is it 15% rate
[03:03:13] and 30% crit damage for free uh as you
[03:03:17] play so be mindful of that with your
[03:03:18] build now for the questions that people
[03:03:20] are actually
[03:03:24] asking
[03:03:26] um how do you build this [ __ ] well I
[03:03:29] can hear your laptop fan wait really I
[03:03:33] can turn it down for this part my laptop
[03:03:34] might overheat but I'll turn them silent
[03:03:36] for this part
[03:03:37] okay he how do you build this [ __ ] now
[03:03:40] I wish I had the quantum set equipped to
[03:03:42] jump scare you but it's basically like
[03:03:44] this this is jinglu but this is
[03:03:45] basically how you build him in a lot of
[03:03:46] his teams why because a lot of supports
[03:03:49] nil supports you run with him you're
[03:03:50] probably going to run at least silver
[03:03:52] wolf or paila Pella they both reduce
[03:03:55] defense of enemies additionally his
[03:03:57] lonee also ignores defense when you have
[03:04:00] things like this the more de tread or de
[03:04:02] ignore you have the better the more
[03:04:04] efficient it is so the four piece of the
[03:04:06] quantum set is unironically potentially
[03:04:08] his best slot in those situations it's
[03:04:10] not always best slot but it can be and
[03:04:13] it's Al better against Quantum weak
[03:04:14] enemies even though the quantum damage
[03:04:16] is wasted because you ignore either 10%
[03:04:18] or 20% defense which is good this set is
[03:04:21] actually stupid good and I wish I farmed
[03:04:22] it more for right now though my only
[03:04:24] good set is on jinglu and I still think
[03:04:26] most people are just going to go the
[03:04:27] alternative set which is just two-piece
[03:04:29] twopiece very easy to build you go
[03:04:31] twopiece something with twopiece
[03:04:33] something um usually you can do two
[03:04:36] imaginary with either two attack or two
[03:04:39] follow-up attack which is Ash blazing
[03:04:41] Grand duuk because 20% follow attack
[03:04:42] damage is really good
[03:04:44] now two piece two piece is actually not
[03:04:46] far behind it's pretty similar
[03:04:47] Alternatives include four piece followup
[03:04:49] attack for some attack percent and full
[03:04:52] attack damage it's not bad it's pretty
[03:04:53] similar to 2b2 piece uh it's not like
[03:04:56] insane though but basically you'll just
[03:04:58] get attack percent and you'll get full
[03:04:59] attack damage so it's pretty similar or
[03:05:01] you can do four piece of the Wasteland
[03:05:03] imaginary set four piece Wasteland is
[03:05:06] weird because you'll all okay basically
[03:05:08] you'll always gain 10 imaginary and 10
[03:05:10] crit rate just getting that is already
[03:05:12] good like it's already fine it's not
[03:05:14] like going to be as good as like four
[03:05:15] quantum or whatever but just that is
[03:05:17] good 10% imaginary damage 10 crit rate
[03:05:19] is fine now if the enemies are in prison
[03:05:21] you get 20% crit damage which you can do
[03:05:23] by either weakness breaking or running
[03:05:25] welth but it's
[03:05:28] like it's inconsistent that's second
[03:05:31] part so it's not going to happen that
[03:05:32] often um but it can be more crage when
[03:05:36] it happens if not it's just 10 crit rate
[03:05:38] and 10 imaginary
[03:05:40] typically um typically though two be
[03:05:43] twopiece is just the the the way to go I
[03:05:45] mean like four piece can be better but
[03:05:46] typically it's easy to just go sub stats
[03:05:48] TW be twopiece cuz there's so many good
[03:05:49] attack percent imaginary followup attack
[03:05:51] all of those are fine
[03:05:53] um yeah you don't go full attack four
[03:05:56] piece full attack four piece is fine it
[03:05:57] depends on substats so full attack four
[03:05:59] Beast is usually a bit worse than two
[03:06:00] Beast two Beast um but because it's not
[03:06:03] that okay yeah to specify four Beast is
[03:06:06] a bit worse than two Beast two beast but
[03:06:07] because it's not that far behind it's
[03:06:10] fine go on sub stats like this is fine
[03:06:14] this four piece is fine this four piece
[03:06:16] is fine twopiece twopiece is typically
[03:06:18] just the way to go but then Quantum four
[03:06:20] piece can be better A lot of the times
[03:06:22] assuming you're running defense reducing
[03:06:24] supports like silver fora and or his
[03:06:26] signature lone which also ignores
[03:06:28] defense kind of like jinglu very very
[03:06:30] similar to to uh her so that's how it
[03:06:34] works um I have the math somewhere like
[03:06:36] I literally have the [ __ ] Cals but I
[03:06:38] didn't I have to pull them up um oh my
[03:06:42] God s you send me a [ __ ] you sent me
[03:06:43] a Yap
[03:06:46] essay I mean I I basically said
[03:06:48] everything you sent me even without
[03:06:50] checking it but I mean I didn't get to
[03:06:51] the stats
[03:06:55] yet but yeah also I'm pretty sure four
[03:06:58] piece and okay to also add I'm pretty
[03:07:01] sure four piece wastelander not I'm
[03:07:02] pretty sure I know four piece
[03:07:03] wastelander on average can be a bit
[03:07:05] better than twopiece twopiece but it
[03:07:07] depends on the up time of the second
[03:07:08] part and it depends on sub stats now if
[03:07:10] you look at it straight up like 10% crit
[03:07:12] rate can be better than 12% attack cuz
[03:07:15] that's what you get even if you don't
[03:07:16] get the crit damage the 10% crit rate
[03:07:17] can be better than the uh uh 12% attack
[03:07:20] but you could also go the follow-up set
[03:07:22] instead and you might get the crit
[03:07:23] damage on it so it it just depends but I
[03:07:25] think it's not
[03:07:30] bad
[03:07:32] foggy I guess the better way to say it
[03:07:34] is your best in slot set your best in
[03:07:37] thought set will either be for Quantum
[03:07:39] or for Wasteland or twopiece twopiece
[03:07:43] those are basically the ways to go and
[03:07:44] then the two pieces could be anything
[03:07:46] for more information Quantum is best in
[03:07:48] slot if you have defense treading um
[03:07:51] like silver wolf or paa or signature
[03:07:53] lyone because the more you have the
[03:07:54] better or de ignore whatever you want to
[03:07:56] call it and then two Beast two Beast is
[03:07:58] a lot easier to build and not far behind
[03:08:00] and similar to TWP twop is four piece
[03:08:02] Wasteland which gets better if you can
[03:08:04] make use of the 20% crit damage against
[03:08:05] imprison enemies usually you won't be
[03:08:07] able to well a lot of times you won't be
[03:08:08] able to but if you weakness break
[03:08:10] imaginary weak enemies or have wels alt
[03:08:12] whatever then you can and then even if
[03:08:13] not 10% crit rate is enough it's kind of
[03:08:16] like another two-piece to where the four
[03:08:17] piece is still good uh and generally the
[03:08:19] like quote unquote go-to but it's not
[03:08:21] really the most efficient set to farm we
[03:08:23] might get new sets in 2.0 who knows so I
[03:08:26] kind of don't recommend going all the
[03:08:27] way for four piece but you can and it's
[03:08:29] potentially is best as slot two piece
[03:08:31] two piece is very similar though and
[03:08:32] four piece Quantum is best as slot in a
[03:08:34] lot of situations where you have de
[03:08:36] reduction I kind of reset everything I
[03:08:37] said earlier so I could just keep this
[03:08:39] part in the video so I don't have to Y
[03:08:40] for 10 hours with that in mind four
[03:08:42] piece full up attack
[03:08:43] is viable too it's just worse than
[03:08:45] twopiece twopiece it's like 5 to 10 no
[03:08:47] not 10 like 5 to 7% worse but it's
[03:08:50] fine it depends on some stats so yeah I
[03:08:53] wish I had Quantum though but my only
[03:08:54] good Quantum sets on jinglu but the
[03:08:57] builds are pretty similar in fact for
[03:08:59] planner there's three sets that are
[03:09:00] basically the same iner Salo [ __ ]
[03:09:02] Glam and space stealing station Glam can
[03:09:05] be the best if you have enough speed
[03:09:06] either 135 or 160 even just 135 is
[03:09:08] enough because you get 12% damage and
[03:09:10] 12% attack iner salotto very very very
[03:09:13] similar cuz you get crit rate ultimate
[03:09:15] and especially full attack damage so
[03:09:16] both of these are basically as good go
[03:09:18] on sub stats same with space stealing
[03:09:20] station 24% attack also very similar so
[03:09:23] just go based on sub stats stat-wise
[03:09:25] super easy you want crit you want speed
[03:09:28] don't I mean okay you can go attack
[03:09:30] attack's fine but speed is just great on
[03:09:32] DPSS uh but you know crit body crit rate
[03:09:34] or crit damage speed or attack imaginary
[03:09:37] and then attack rope I like speed boots
[03:09:39] especially if you can go for a break
[03:09:40] point like 134 but even just enough
[03:09:42] speed is enough speed
[03:09:43] uh
[03:09:46] and for your body crit rate and crit
[03:09:49] damage is fine but crit damage is like
[03:09:52] easier quote unquote easier because you
[03:09:54] get a lot of crit rate through your
[03:09:55] traces and this passive but you Pro like
[03:09:59] me personally with this crit damage L
[03:10:01] cone uh I still need a crit rate body so
[03:10:03] just go whichever one you
[03:10:06] need attack boots with a 160 plus speed
[03:10:09] BR basically yeah if your br's
[03:10:11] like I mean even with
[03:10:15] like never mind I can't talk about that
[03:10:19] yeah there's situations where attack
[03:10:20] boots can be better speed is the general
[03:10:21] recommendation attack can be fine
[03:10:23] especially if you have speed buffers or
[03:10:25] BR or don't need more
[03:10:27] speed cool uh L cone wise very easy
[03:10:32] there's like three options outside of
[03:10:33] that don't talk to me either you get his
[03:10:35] signature or you use topaz with lonee or
[03:10:38] you use the free-to-play S5 cruising in
[03:10:41] the cell SE amazing free playay like you
[03:10:43] get from her shop which is what I was
[03:10:44] using I just got forced not forced but
[03:10:48] uh uh uh influenced into pulling for
[03:10:50] Signature but I was planning on using
[03:10:52] cruising other C very good only like 12%
[03:10:54] 10 to 15 worse than his signature very
[03:10:56] good cuz I'm dying because it gives you
[03:10:59] 16% crit rate all the time then you also
[03:11:01] get up to 16% more crit rate against low
[03:11:03] HP enemies and attack by 40% a 40%
[03:11:06] attack when you defeat an enemy so
[03:11:07] really good uh however the only lones
[03:11:10] better than this are his signature which
[03:11:12] is pretty insane or topaz lone which is
[03:11:14] pretty good but not as good as signature
[03:11:16] his signature is really good cuz it
[03:11:17] gives you a ton of crit damage you get
[03:11:19] 20% and then up to 8times three 24% more
[03:11:23] uh against just basically always I say
[03:11:25] up to because it scales on debuffs but
[03:11:27] you're always going to have that um
[03:11:29] you're always going to have that and
[03:11:30] then if that was enough you also ignore
[03:11:32] defense which is huge and increase the
[03:11:36] defense wait what the [ __ ] does it
[03:11:38] increase why am I
[03:11:40] forgetting oh just all damage okay yeah
[03:11:42] increases all of your damage by 36 and
[03:11:44] you ignore defense which is huge so it's
[03:11:46] really good it's just really good um
[03:11:49] someone said how do you know all of this
[03:11:50] as I forgot something so that answers it
[03:11:52] but yeah this is a really good lone uh
[03:11:54] it's not I don't think it's needed
[03:11:55] because one you can use topazes and two
[03:11:57] you can use this really good
[03:11:59] free-to-play her aore lone but this
[03:12:01] lyone is you can only get one and it's
[03:12:03] good on like every Hunt character so I
[03:12:05] understand that it may be hard but I
[03:12:07] like it so either this or this are the
[03:12:09] two either baptism of pure thought or
[03:12:11] topazes or cruising the Alternatives
[03:12:13] include the Dan hung lyone only silence
[03:12:16] remains or technically the battle pass
[03:12:17] one or technically cely lyone but
[03:12:19] they're all a bit worse cool also for if
[03:12:23] you're playing more than one hun carry a
[03:12:25] lot of times you can give Sword Play to
[03:12:26] the other like uh topaz or whoever the
[03:12:28] [ __ ] but anyways I digress um what else
[03:12:32] did I did I talk about everything oh I
[03:12:34] okay we're not going to talk about
[03:12:35] everyon because I'm not a whale but E1
[03:12:37] basically just gives you uh all it does
[03:12:40] is give you four times what is it at 1.5
[03:12:43] and three so all it does is give you 10
[03:12:45] crit rate 20 crit damage all E1 does is
[03:12:47] 10 crit rate 20 crit damage literally
[03:12:50] nothing else literally nothing else
[03:12:52] that's not bad it's just more stats it's
[03:12:54] not more fun it's not more gameplay it's
[03:12:55] just a bit more stats 10 crit rate 20
[03:12:57] crit damage it's fine it's it's a lot of
[03:13:00] stats yeah that's 40 crit value that's a
[03:13:02] lot of stats but that's it so if you
[03:13:04] want it you can get it I like the ly
[03:13:07] cone more the ly cone is a lot of damage
[03:13:09] I would choose the lyone over E1 it's
[03:13:11] also a flexible Ione because it's not
[03:13:13] something cringe that gives you
[03:13:18] well I mean it's not cringe
[03:13:21] right it's good on like yeah no it's
[03:13:23] just good because I was thinking like
[03:13:25] yeah there's like the debuff part but
[03:13:26] even without it like double yeah no it's
[03:13:30] a lot better it's also like my point was
[03:13:32] it's also usable on like a lot of other
[03:13:34] uh
[03:13:35] characters the only thing is yeah the de
[03:13:37] ignore is only for followup attacks I do
[03:13:39] want to specify that but so that but
[03:13:41] even okay so that's really good for him
[03:13:43] but then for other hunt characters it's
[03:13:45] like if they full of attack it's great
[03:13:46] and even if they don't you get damage
[03:13:47] dealt increased by 36% and 20% 20% plus
[03:13:51] up to another 24% crit damage so I think
[03:13:54] it's just
[03:13:55] good um yeah good like on I like it more
[03:13:57] than
[03:13:58] E1 teams are pretty easy except they're
[03:14:01] not except they are no they're not I
[03:14:02] mean they are but they're not they are
[03:14:04] but you have a lot of options so you're
[03:14:06] running him with a debuffer basically
[03:14:08] always because you want to have at least
[03:14:11] ideally five debuffs I say at least
[03:14:13] three but ideally five um because you
[03:14:15] want to be able well yeah three to five
[03:14:17] because you want to be able to max out
[03:14:18] his uh passives megal think up five
[03:14:21] months I'm going to mute alert though
[03:14:22] but I appreciate it I know this isn't
[03:14:24] like a full guide so it doesn't really
[03:14:25] matter like I'm not like ranting ranting
[03:14:26] but still for those of you wondering so
[03:14:28] that's what you want uh his his part is
[03:14:31] typically going to be one Healer one
[03:14:34] debuffer and then Flex Flex could either
[03:14:37] be another buffer or another debuffer or
[03:14:39] another followup attacker BAS basically
[03:14:42] just topaz um so how it looks is you're
[03:14:45] going to choose a
[03:14:46] debuffer uh regarding debuffers I want
[03:14:49] to say that the resolution shines as
[03:14:53] pearls of sweat basically just the naked
[03:14:55] back L cone uh can give you just a free
[03:14:57] debuff the ins snare one it only lasts
[03:14:59] one turn but it's very easy to proc and
[03:15:01] it reduces the defense of enemies so
[03:15:02] it's really good um now obviously this
[03:15:05] lyone the uh before the TR Mission
[03:15:08] starts is broken but uh if you can use
[03:15:10] this on like let's say peila and you
[03:15:12] need another debuff it is quite good so
[03:15:14] keep that in mind if you need another
[03:15:15] one with that said nil characters like
[03:15:18] silverwolf great silver gives like
[03:15:19] literally a million different debuffs
[03:15:21] she has the bugs she has the death
[03:15:22] reduction she can implant a weakness her
[03:15:24] skill has one like there's literally so
[03:15:25] many debuffs that Sil roof alone is
[03:15:27] usually enough on top of doctor ratios
[03:15:29] one and he reduces effect res uh outside
[03:15:31] of that P can be good she can give like
[03:15:33] she gives one with her Al that's
[03:15:35] vulnerab like defense rad then she gives
[03:15:37] one with her uh well okay that's the
[03:15:39] main one the other ones you can get are
[03:15:41] the back lonee resolution if you have it
[03:15:44] that can make it two and if you have E4
[03:15:46] this makes you this makes it to where
[03:15:48] you can use your skill for another
[03:15:49] debuff it makes you use a skill point
[03:15:51] but you can do it if you want another uh
[03:15:53] skill so you can't another debuff so you
[03:15:55] can get up to three but usually it's one
[03:15:58] um outside of that green a Fen I need to
[03:16:03] level her but I know she's good with him
[03:16:05] because she has decent damage and
[03:16:06] increases your damage has a
[03:16:07] vulnerability debuff has another debuff
[03:16:10] just a lot of [ __ ] in her kit that helps
[03:16:11] you
[03:16:13] uh I need to level mine so that I can
[03:16:14] actually use her but I uh yeah she'll
[03:16:17] she'll
[03:16:19] yeah wait I actually have notes on her
[03:16:22] so that I don't
[03:16:25] forget Pila gives three plus lone wait
[03:16:28] how if you're talking about technique
[03:16:30] don't talk to me but is there isn't it
[03:16:32] just alt and then e is there a third
[03:16:41] one
[03:16:45] Oh e plus E4 wait
[03:17:00] really am I getting one
[03:17:08] guide I'm getting one
[03:17:10] guide I mean I know the tech has this
[03:17:13] but I'm getting one guy check E4 I
[03:17:16] already talked about
[03:17:18] E4 I already talked about E4 I said E4
[03:17:21] is one L cone is one if you're running
[03:17:23] the back L cone and then Al is another
[03:17:25] so three okay I guess I'm
[03:17:28] wrong sorry sorry sorry okay it's fine I
[03:17:31] just it's fine cuz see in genin I know
[03:17:34] so much that okay not the flex I feel
[03:17:36] like I'm an idiot but I I can call out
[03:17:38] [ __ ] easily in Star I'm still
[03:17:40] getting back I'm still in the process of
[03:17:42] learning everything so I can get one
[03:17:43] guide very easily okay so please bear
[03:17:46] anyways Queen F really good cuz her
[03:17:48] damage is decent and she gives you a lot
[03:17:49] of good Buffs uh vulnerability buff
[03:17:52] which basically just gives you more
[03:17:53] damage also has stuff that I noted
[03:17:55] because mine is low level
[03:18:00] uh yes also you can run the same back L
[03:18:03] cone if you want another one and her E1
[03:18:04] also gives her another debuff yes
[03:18:06] another debuff so that can be another
[03:18:07] one if you have E1 and just like dot
[03:18:10] stuff so she can be pretty good to have
[03:18:11] the team as well
[03:18:13] uh
[03:18:15] also is there anyone else I want to talk
[03:18:17] about yeah also there's some people like
[03:18:20] I feel like it's cope to go like a DOT
[03:18:22] team with like CFA or sampo or Luca like
[03:18:25] you kind of can it counts but I don't
[03:18:27] really recommend it maybe just test it
[03:18:29] more but I don't really want to talk
[03:18:31] about that outside of the debuffers
[03:18:34] though there's great buffers uh in fact
[03:18:36] Ron can be both she gives you one debuff
[03:18:38] it's on her alt which isn't the most
[03:18:41] consistently consistent thing heral is
[03:18:44] great but it only lasts for two turns
[03:18:46] and then when you're inside of it it
[03:18:47] debuffs the enemies res pen increase
[03:18:49] right it'll debuff the enemies
[03:18:50] vulnerability or whatever it's called
[03:18:51] really good uh on top of just being one
[03:18:53] of the most broken supports in the game
[03:18:54] great Harmony so I recommend her uh she
[03:18:57] also gives you break effect uh not not
[03:18:59] break effect but she gives you weakness
[03:19:01] break efficiency which is huge on top of
[03:19:03] his already really good uh break so Ron
[03:19:05] is very good uh Ting Yun can be good for
[03:19:08] energy and attack if you need a buffer
[03:19:09] and already have enough debuffs like the
[03:19:12] I'm talking about now or if you have
[03:19:13] enough debuffs so like tenting Yun you
[03:19:15] could also use BR Bron uses a lot of
[03:19:19] um Bron uses a lot of skill points the
[03:19:22] problem like that's the main problem but
[03:19:25] there's two ways to do go around this
[03:19:26] one you have a really skill point
[03:19:27] efficient team for example Lua paila or
[03:19:30] something like that or two and
[03:19:32] especially if your Bron is built very
[03:19:34] fast she can be skill point neutral or a
[03:19:37] bit more skill point efficient you can
[03:19:38] like basic attack and then your ratio
[03:19:40] goes and then you go again on Silver uh
[03:19:42] on BR and then you use your skill you
[03:19:44] can do like basic into skill so there's
[03:19:46] ways to do that if you like 160 speed or
[03:19:47] high it depends on your DPS speed as
[03:19:49] well but there's ways to do it with fast
[03:19:52] bronia
[03:19:53] um like I know for me I play 100 speeed
[03:19:56] blade and 170 BR and it Lins up but
[03:19:59] anyway oh voice crack anyways that's
[03:20:01] mostly it for teams your last one's
[03:20:03] going to be a Healer the good healers
[03:20:04] are always the same literally always the
[03:20:06] same in every team always no matter what
[03:20:07] always basically with a few exceptions
[03:20:09] but no one cares about the exceptions
[03:20:11] Lua great skill point efficient huo
[03:20:13] great skill point efficient you have to
[03:20:14] use your skill to heal but still uh alt
[03:20:17] gives energy which is the main upside
[03:20:19] and attack uh uh is it attack or is it
[03:20:21] damage it's attack I know it's attack
[03:20:22] why am I doubting myself yeah it's
[03:20:24] attack so you get uh energy and attack
[03:20:26] on top of just pretty good healing
[03:20:28] fushan also pretty skill point efficient
[03:20:30] uh and gives you crit rate while also
[03:20:32] having like CC resistance stuff and oh
[03:20:35] yeah also you get cleanses from these
[03:20:36] characters so you get Cleanse Plus
[03:20:38] healing plus skill point efficiency with
[03:20:40] skill point efficiency with ultra and
[03:20:41] energy and attack with wo and crit rate
[03:20:43] with
[03:20:44] hen Alternatives that are not five stars
[03:20:48] include Lynx who's a good free to-play
[03:20:50] healer and
[03:20:52] cleanser or well technically a five star
[03:20:54] but japar who I don't have
[03:20:57] or
[03:20:59] um I mean I guess Natasha but yeah
[03:21:03] that's it I think Lynx is
[03:21:05] great regarding ASA she gets better with
[03:21:08] idolon I think she's fine she gives you
[03:21:11] speed gives you attack can run a light
[03:21:13] cone for example a debuff one or can go
[03:21:15] on to give her
[03:21:17] energy like meshing cogs she's
[03:21:24] fine but that's it now I will say I
[03:21:28] forgot to me well I didn't forget to
[03:21:29] mention I just didn't want to save this
[03:21:30] for last but I guess I'm saving it for
[03:21:31] last toaz is also really good toaz is
[03:21:33] great with Dr ratio so she gives you
[03:21:37] just a lot of okay so she has good
[03:21:39] damage and she will buff your full full
[03:21:42] attack damage with Dr ratio they have
[03:21:43] good Synergy with each other topaz can
[03:21:45] proc which procs like Dr ratio's full
[03:21:47] attack through his Al topaz uh just has
[03:21:50] good Synergy with full attackers in
[03:21:51] general will buff your damage and will
[03:21:53] also debuff enemies through
[03:21:56] her where is it it's the vulnerability
[03:21:58] thing yeah this one it incre the proof
[03:21:59] of death thing it increases the damage
[03:22:02] that the enemies take from F attacks so
[03:22:03] she has one debuff the pro uh if you
[03:22:07] want more debuffs you can get her
[03:22:08] signature lone that's one more and her
[03:22:10] E1 that's another you can get up to
[03:22:11] three
[03:22:12] but even just base topaz is good more
[03:22:14] damage and one debuff uh the only other
[03:22:17] debuffer I didn't mention is welth welth
[03:22:19] Works he's just very skill point hungry
[03:22:21] uh like you don't need to spam skill
[03:22:22] every turn but you do want a skill uh
[03:22:24] because it does count as a debuff and
[03:22:26] then you can get a debuff from his alt
[03:22:27] it could slow and you can also imprison
[03:22:29] wealth is fine it's just very skill
[03:22:30] point hungry I don't like him as much as
[03:22:32] the others but I think he works that's
[03:22:37] all every time I say I I wealth works
[03:22:39] but he's not as good as others I get
[03:22:40] like 50 people are like actually WTH the
[03:22:42] best so if you like WTH you can play WTH
[03:22:44] but he does take a lot of skill
[03:22:46] points or at least more than like a I
[03:22:49] mean I guess you are Skilling on silver
[03:22:51] in this team but you don't need to
[03:22:52] because once you have like the five six
[03:22:53] debuffs you don't need to skill on her
[03:22:55] you just basic but yeah
[03:22:56] anyways do you say Talent order Trey's
[03:22:59] priority is uh I mean I guess I could
[03:23:01] say that tre's priority should be skill
[03:23:03] no sorry I lied TR priority should be
[03:23:05] talent and then skill and then Al just
[03:23:06] given how much you increase from each
[03:23:08] and then your follow attack is the main
[03:23:09] part of your kid like talents is the
[03:23:10] most important I mean obviously unlock
[03:23:12] all your traces
[03:23:15] though okay that's all does raer need
[03:23:18] Bennett Shang Ling I will find you I
[03:23:21] think that's
[03:23:22] everything uh I could look through your
[03:23:25] message
[03:23:33] s Dam you're you
[03:23:40] yappy yeah no I mean I'm pretty much on
[03:23:42] the same
[03:23:44] page yeah that's basically all you need
[03:23:46] to know sorry if I yapped for too long I
[03:23:48] didn't want this to be long I learned my
[03:23:50] yapping from the best okay yeah I don't
[03:23:52] want this to be too long but hopefully
[03:23:54] this helped uh I will make you full
[03:23:56] guide for the next characters though
[03:23:57] where I can actually Yap in freedom but
[03:23:59] for the most part Rao's he's pretty good
[03:24:01] um I do think he gets a lot more you'll
[03:24:04] see a lot higher numbers when you have
[03:24:07] good supports of them good debuffs
[03:24:08] either topaz or like silver wolf paila
[03:24:11] bronia uh uh Ron May stuff like that but
[03:24:14] I think he's actually pretty good he's
[03:24:15] not like I don't think he's gamebreaking
[03:24:16] I don't think he's like okay it's day
[03:24:19] one and I'm feels crafting but he
[03:24:20] doesn't feel as good as like
[03:24:21] jinglu or like blade and stuff but he
[03:24:24] does feel pretty decent in terms of the
[03:24:25] hunt carries that's all which is cool
[03:24:28] and he's free oh free I love
[03:24:33] freedom he's also a very single
[03:24:39] Target yeah
[03:24:44] he's great for a free character yeah
[03:24:46] he's really good for free character kind
[03:24:47] of like aloy aloy is great for free
[03:24:50] character Jing Li feels amazing drooling
[03:24:53] face emoji okay I agree but please
[03:24:55] remove the Emoji that made it weird and
[03:24:58] uh now I don't know what to
[03:25:10] say
[03:25:19] this might be like a seveny year long
[03:25:20] second Channel video I actually yeah
[03:25:22] have to wait too
[03:25:24] long can you play weather ways you want
[03:25:26] damaging your relationship to hoyo yeah
[03:25:28] I don't think it
[03:25:30] matters I don't think I don't think
[03:25:33] they'd be I can play whatever I want for
[03:25:34] the most
[03:25:38] part I mean I don't know unless there a
[03:25:41] game that's like a brand
[03:25:44] risk play Elden ring then okay all
[03:25:51] right why would it damage it no I
[03:25:56] wouldn't like unless it's a game that's
[03:25:57] like a brand risk or they like like
[03:25:59] someone's like I don't know unless it's
[03:26:01] like sus
[03:26:03] or someone doesn't want you to like I
[03:26:06] don't even
[03:26:10] know
[03:26:12] are you guys just making excuses for why
[03:26:14] I haven't [ __ ]
[03:26:21] varied you played non hoyo gotas before
[03:26:23] yeah yeah I still play I mean I kind of
[03:26:25] stopped playing but I still play Cookie
[03:26:27] Run Kingdom I streamed that a few
[03:26:29] times we streamed epic 7 we streamed did
[03:26:34] do I just don't take a lot of gacha
[03:26:36] sponsors unless I like the game because
[03:26:38] I'm not the biggest fan of gacha in
[03:26:39] general like I like games I I like
[03:26:41] genjin I like Star rail but I'm not a
[03:26:43] big fan of
[03:26:44] gacha uh I don't like the system I don't
[03:26:47] like gacha in general so I don't take
[03:26:49] less sponsors of those that's all uh I
[03:26:51] think I I don't know if I can talk about
[03:26:53] it but I think I can but I have a game
[03:26:55] sponsor coming up soon it's not gacha
[03:26:57] but it looks fun and I think other uh
[03:27:00] like genjin streamers like auu and stuff
[03:27:02] are doing it not to speak for him but it
[03:27:04] looks fun so we'll talk about that later
[03:27:05] but
[03:27:10] yeah
[03:27:14] it's Elden ring dude it's not I would if
[03:27:16] Elden ring asked me I would do an Elden
[03:27:18] ring sponsor stream for

[04:23:50] do I 32 of
[04:23:53] those dude how many [ __ ] dude we got
[04:23:56] like well not even a 10 bull but we got
[04:23:58] a lot of [ __ ] Jades
[04:24:05] nice
[04:24:11] do the Jeff C
[04:24:13] review 122 speed 54 136 okay looking
[04:24:18] very a Jeff like six talents I can't
[04:24:20] even click on the pieces what the [ __ ]
[04:24:23] okay this game of counterview sucks the
[04:24:25] [ __ ] wait why can't I click on the
[04:24:32] pieces why is that level
[04:24:35] 50
[04:24:48] more speed than your blade okay but I my
[04:24:50] blade doesn't need speed okay do you
[04:24:52] guys want to see actually the best blade
[04:24:54] you've ever seen let me [ __ ] show you
[04:24:56] let me [ __ ] show you how this works
[04:24:58] let me educate you let me educate you
[04:25:00] let me educate
[04:25:04] you 10 bands 20 BS 100 BS let me educate
[04:25:09] you
[04:25:19] uh so been gearing you
[04:25:35] [ __ ] wait why is our speed lower than
[04:25:54] usual oh seven that's why plus
[04:26:02] one bro why isn't it filtering by
[04:26:04] biggest the smallest the it not
[04:26:06] understand how speed oh 11 11 11 11 175
[04:26:10] wait that's lowkey too much uh wait no I
[04:26:13] think it's fine so with with a 30%
[04:26:15] Advance you want 100 speed but our
[04:26:17] Advance isn't Max Talent level so it's
[04:26:19] only a 24% advance so I think this is
[04:26:21] the good amount of speed but I could be
[04:26:23] wrong let me show you guys what I mean
[04:26:25] let me show you guys what I
[04:26:29] mean
[04:26:31] watch watch
[04:26:35] this
[04:26:50] good damage doesn't matter oh [ __ ] did I
[04:26:52] only put three characters where the [ __ ]
[04:26:54] dude how
[04:26:55] did it actually doesn't matter I
[04:27:04] mean
[04:27:13] bro okay watch this watch
[04:27:17] this watch this watch this watch this
[04:27:19] watch this watch this watch
[04:27:21] this watch watch watch watch watch watch
[04:27:23] watch unless I [ __ ] it up by putting
[04:27:25] too much speed look look look look so
[04:27:28] okay watch
[04:27:31] this yeah bronia
[04:27:34] goes it's fine laa
[04:27:44] goes blade
[04:27:52] goes felds crafting I mean I mathed it
[04:27:54] but uh at 30% we're at 24 so okay blade
[04:27:59] goes then BR although my silver doesn't
[04:28:01] have Al so that's unfortunate what it is
[04:28:04] then we go blade so we have successfully
[04:28:06] Bron twice and bladed
[04:28:10] twice I have no
[04:28:12] energy let's see if it still
[04:28:16] works it's for little we have like no
[04:28:18] debuffs up we're just trying to see if
[04:28:19] it works but it looks like it
[04:28:21] works coms
[04:28:25] optim P gets Al there yeah p is just
[04:28:29] better then bronia goes again other
[04:28:32] characters don't matter that blade okay
[04:28:35] it works wait but it's not was that the
[04:28:37] same as it was before I wasn't looking
[04:28:38] at the action
[04:28:42] values that paradise
[04:28:48] made okay then we do
[04:28:52] this will then we do this and then
[04:28:55] bronia should be yeah they're lined up
[04:28:57] again okay it
[04:28:59] works so we always go
[04:29:01] twice
[04:29:04] easy
[04:29:11] we always go twice on our blades on
[04:29:12] negative speed but ARR also needs more
[04:29:15] CR damage but that's just like it's
[04:29:17] eventual optimizations eventual I just
[04:29:20] don't have good pieces yet it'll come
[04:29:22] soon I mean this is technically
[04:29:27] better but you
[04:29:29] know I mean I have like this piece that
[04:29:31] I'm not this piece I'm not this piece
[04:29:34] that I'm not using 30 crit damage but
[04:29:35] there's no speed on it so going to have
[04:29:37] to choose which is better I think for my
[04:29:40] blade build the speed is still better
[04:29:42] than the crit damage cuz it's not like
[04:29:43] you transfer like that much of your crit
[04:29:46] damage
[04:29:47] um but
[04:29:51] no well I launch
[04:29:57] easier
[04:29:59] anyways that's
[04:30:04] cool
[04:30:13] I could upload
[04:30:15] the golden gears
[04:30:18] clear to the second Channel just like
[04:30:20] the first one I did I think it's just
[04:30:21] decent content but I did it in two
[04:30:23] separate streams so I don't [ __ ]
[04:30:26] know alerts oh alerts are still muted oh
[04:30:28] my bad what the [ __ ] it's been like an
[04:30:34] hour
[04:30:39] bro
[04:30:50] um redeemable with
[04:30:53] heram the
[04:31:00] [ __ ] Dr Rael benched he's not
[04:31:04] benched
[04:31:07] okay we'll do a a simulated Universe run
[04:31:09] and then I'll I'll go I don't
[04:31:19] know yeah the normal bronia thing is 134
[04:31:22] 135 DPS but I don't really like I mean I
[04:31:24] like that but I'd rather just have a 170
[04:31:26] bronia like why not if you can do it why
[04:31:29] not but for zero cycle like if you're
[04:31:31] trying to zero cycle you usually just do
[04:31:33] 135 134
[04:31:42] uh wait which one should we do chat I
[04:31:44] kind of want to do inel
[04:31:49] SoDo but we could also just do World 8
[04:31:52] cuz it's
[04:31:56] new claim your weekly rewards
[04:32:04] oops I love out of eight yeah I'm always
[04:32:06] 11 out of
[04:32:08] eight I can do this
[04:32:12] one would a 170 be off sync no if your
[04:32:15] DPS is it depends on your DPS is speed
[04:32:16] if your DPS is 100 and your Bron is 170
[04:32:19] with 30% Advance I'm pretty sure it
[04:32:20] lines up but it depends on your speed
[04:32:24] usually with Bron you just minus one
[04:32:26] like whatever your DPS is and then minus
[04:32:28] one but there's other ways to do
[04:32:34] it
[04:32:38] we're going to play veritus
[04:32:43] ratio danger danger Ron
[04:32:47] May where is Ron may I can't find
[04:32:53] her where the [ __ ] is she bro where she
[04:32:56] is
[04:33:04] silol
[04:33:08] Ron May okay I didn't say that play
[04:33:12] wealth you got him today don't talk to
[04:33:19] me T curio that's really
[04:33:24] good dude CUO is not always the best but
[04:33:27] if you don't choose it it's like are you
[04:33:28] trying to live a boring life like why
[04:33:31] would you ever willingly why would you
[04:33:33] ever be like oh oh oh all three all
[04:33:35] three are you [ __ ] me with a javelin
[04:33:38] calm down calm down calm down but like
[04:33:39] why would you choose to
[04:33:42] like all will be why do you choose to be
[04:33:47] boring this is double speed this is
[04:33:50] double
[04:33:58] speed sobody animations just to do five
[04:34:04] damage
[04:34:19] Kito
[04:34:21] ergosum Away by
[04:34:29] the why does someone type don't scream I
[04:34:32] have autism what that's I mean that's
[04:34:34] fine but why what does that why does
[04:34:36] that make me
[04:34:37] not if it you can mute the stream why am
[04:34:41] I
[04:34:52] not screams louder I'm not screaming I'm
[04:34:55] just talking
[04:35:04] loud
[04:35:08] did not okay not to I I don't even know
[04:35:10] if I should talk about this not to get
[04:35:11] like one turbo one guide but I saw okay
[04:35:14] this is a comment with like one like so
[04:35:16] it's literally the most one guy thing
[04:35:18] that a drama farmer would make a video
[04:35:19] out of but it's literally one guy so it
[04:35:21] doesn't matter someone was like yeah I
[04:35:23] tuned into to Z's stream and when the
[04:35:26] quiz like the [ __ ] free quiz that is
[04:35:28] like not scientific at all said he had
[04:35:31] ADHD he said he doesn't want to self-
[04:35:32] diagnose which invalidates my self
[04:35:34] diagnosis and and I can't watch him cuz
[04:35:36] he shouldn't speak about these things
[04:35:37] it's like I dude that's like what I said
[04:35:41] I was like I'm not going
[04:35:43] to I'm not going to take a
[04:35:47] quiz hello
[04:35:51] slice I don't
[04:35:52] know it tilted me so hard it's like look
[04:35:56] if you find your truth in like your own
[04:35:59] research and it helps you and you feel
[04:36:01] seen or it helps you get whatever the
[04:36:03] [ __ ] you need that's great
[04:36:08] however it's I feel like there's a
[04:36:10] danger I don't know I mean my mom was a
[04:36:11] psychologist I talked to her when I
[04:36:13] could but I don't know I took three side
[04:36:17] classes that does makes me I'm so stupid
[04:36:19] I think it's a lot easier and I think I
[04:36:22] think there's a danger of uh uh there's
[04:36:26] like upsides where it's like you can
[04:36:27] find a lot of things that you might
[04:36:29] relate to and you can find Solutions
[04:36:32] like I've not I don't think I
[04:36:34] necessarily have ADHD but I've seen a
[04:36:36] lot of videos of like tips for people
[04:36:38] with it that apply to me I don't know if
[04:36:40] it's because they're generic tips that
[04:36:41] help me Focus or if it's because I don't
[04:36:44] know
[04:36:48] however I also believe uh uh two things
[04:36:51] one I believe in professionals and
[04:36:52] seeing them for diagnosises as it's much
[04:36:55] more reliable two I think there's a
[04:36:57] danger of thinking you have a bunch of
[04:36:59] things because it's easier to like look
[04:37:00] at it and be like I have this I have
[04:37:01] this I have this I have this which can
[04:37:02] be dangerous and it can also invalidate
[04:37:05] the experiences of people that really do
[04:37:06] and that suffer in many different
[04:37:08] situations and then you're just like
[04:37:09] yeah I have it too and you you know
[04:37:12] sometimes it's valid sometimes that's
[04:37:13] all that's that I just have a bit of
[04:37:15] reservations towards it I'm not saying
[04:37:17] it's valid I'm not saying it's invalid
[04:37:18] I'm not saying anything I'm a dumbass
[04:37:20] you
[04:37:23] know but anyways I don't [ __ ] know
[04:37:28] the [ __ ] do I know why you listening to
[04:37:29] me
[04:37:30] for it's diagnoses not diagnoses I don't
[04:37:33] know dude diagnose these
[04:37:46] nuts this combat needs optimizing I mean
[04:37:49] I I don't know I I also I mean I also
[04:37:51] think okay that if you were saying bad
[04:37:54] takes another bad take I think it's I
[04:37:56] think we're getting we have manufactured
[04:37:59] low attention span at this point like I
[04:38:01] think the YouTube meta and the Tik to I
[04:38:03] think Tik Tok and Mr Beast and
[04:38:06] everything past the first Mr Beast video
[04:38:08] has just
[04:38:09] been and it's like you can't it's just
[04:38:12] like boom boom boom boom boom boom bo
[04:38:13] and then now if I watch Like a 10-minute
[04:38:14] video I'm distracted that wasn't like
[04:38:16] that when I was like five years ago I
[04:38:18] was fine now I
[04:38:23] can't it is is unfor very desens
[04:38:26] desensitized term because internet
[04:38:27] normalizes to describe a bunch of
[04:38:28] generic Le sporadic behaviors okay
[04:38:32] yeah yeah yeah I mean no comment but
[04:38:35] like
[04:38:36] yeah the only thing like my
[04:38:40] main okay my main like um reservation
[04:38:45] towards it oh my God what did we just
[04:38:48] get what the
[04:38:50] [ __ ] but yeah my main obervation s is it
[04:38:52] is like a lot of people that like have
[04:38:56] diagnosis a
[04:38:58] diagnosis and like are going through a
[04:39:00] lot I feel like it can be kind of not
[04:39:04] necess neily invalidated I don't want to
[04:39:06] speak for people but I feel like it's
[04:39:09] that is different it it's how do I say
[04:39:14] this if a bunch of people like yeah me
[04:39:16] too yeah me too cuz like you have short
[04:39:18] attention span versus people that are
[04:39:20] like actively need medication to like be
[04:39:22] able to be productive or to be able to
[04:39:25] have the same productivity as someone uh
[04:39:27] uh like I guess neurotypical is the word
[04:39:30] it's like very like almost
[04:39:33] invalidating I don't know
[04:39:35] I don't know I don't [ __ ]
[04:39:37] know I mean it doesn't really matter
[04:39:39] like this isn't it's not like a serious
[04:39:41] thought that's just thoughts in my head
[04:39:44] but talk like access to Medical Care is
[04:39:46] widely available well I'm Canadian but
[04:39:49] yes
[04:39:50] obviously but like which is why I
[04:39:56] said um which is why I said it's
[04:39:59] obviously if a diagnosis is really
[04:40:00] expensive or it's not worth your money
[04:40:01] or time I think it's worth your time but
[04:40:03] it's not worth your money uh
[04:40:05] maybe you're not Canadian uh or whatever
[04:40:07] it is right that's fine like it's it's
[04:40:11] very it can be very helpful and
[04:40:13] fulfilling
[04:40:16] to like find Solutions online or figure
[04:40:19] out what you I don't say what you have
[04:40:22] but like you know like how your brain
[04:40:24] works type of thing that's very it could
[04:40:27] be very helpful it's just not the same
[04:40:32] as yeah I just feel like
[04:40:35] there's like a fine line between people
[04:40:38] just like being like yeah I have a short
[04:40:39] of 10% ADHD and people who like actually
[04:40:41] have it and it's kind of like you know I
[04:40:45] don't think it's necessarily the same
[04:40:47] and I think it's important to see a
[04:40:48] professional if you can if you can't you
[04:40:51] know just tread with
[04:40:52] caution don't get deated too
[04:40:57] hard so me mental health a lot of
[04:40:59] symptoms overlap well yeah yeah
[04:41:03] yeah
[04:41:07] yeah yeah it's very debilitating and
[04:41:09] validating towards those who actually
[04:41:10] struggle daily that that was my main
[04:41:11] thing it's kind of
[04:41:14] like okay if we're going to talk about
[04:41:16] it we'll talk about it it's kind of like
[04:41:17] why if like I'm not like for example
[04:41:20] Fang has a diagnosis like she has it so
[04:41:23] I don't want to just be like yeah I have
[04:41:24] adhd1 like I don't [ __ ] know and it's
[04:41:26] like even when I
[04:41:31] like how do I how do I word this one
[04:41:34] even when I'm like questioning my okay
[04:41:37] listen don't clip this even when I'm
[04:41:39] questioning my sexuality I don't like
[04:41:41] talking about it too much because I
[04:41:43] don't know where I stand like I
[04:41:46] genuinely don't know because I don't
[04:41:47] really have time to think like I'm just
[04:41:49] whatever I live and I like what I like I
[04:41:50] don't care but like I don't want to
[04:41:52] associate to a group that's like like I
[04:41:54] don't want to not associate but like I
[04:41:55] don't want to make it seem like I'm like
[04:41:58] oppressed when I'm not if that makes
[04:42:00] sense like it don't be like yeah like
[04:42:01] you know
[04:42:02] like I'm like you and then it's like
[04:42:04] people who are like getting like
[04:42:07] [ __ ] like discriminated against so
[04:42:10] that's my you
[04:42:12] know that's my tiptoeing the
[04:42:19] line
[04:42:26] Bas well it's even like why I call
[04:42:28] myself spicy white CU like I'm Middle
[04:42:30] Eastern but I look white so I have
[04:42:33] like
[04:42:35] I feel like I benefit from some like
[04:42:37] white privilege to a certain extent but

[04:44:24] separate titles and each video will be
[04:44:27] like your perspective and then my
[04:44:28] perspective so there'll be separate
[04:44:30] videos so people want to watch both
[04:44:33] true

[04:44:44] dude I looked over I've been like for 4
[04:44:45] hours 44 minutes 44 seconds that was
[04:44:47] like the perfect
[04:44:49] time comat needs this
[04:45:03] is
[04:45:09] want have the most deep matter ever then
[04:45:10] all of a sudden started yapping about
[04:45:11] HSR yeah dude that's that's a z stream
[04:45:14] roller
[04:45:16] coaster I was just getting one guy
[04:45:19] that's all put me on a on on a tie
[04:45:25] raade are you considered variety dude
[04:45:29] yes
[04:45:30] eventually it clear you with my
[04:45:32] artifacts copium that's copium I'm the
[04:45:34] best of squeezing you okay you know the
[04:45:37] expression you can milk lemons you [ __ ]
[04:45:39] you know the expression you can milk a
[04:45:40] cow but you can't milk a rat I'm really
[04:45:42] good at milking a rat that sounded very
[04:45:44] bad but let me explain it's like okay
[04:45:45] let me rephrase that it's like I'm good
[04:45:48] at making something out of nothing not
[04:45:50] literal listen it's like if you get an
[04:45:52] artifact oh this is so milk but I see an
[04:45:55] artifact that looks lost and unmil and I
[04:45:57] milk it
[04:46:03] anyways
[04:46:06] panda panda panda did I just
[04:46:10] reset did I just get archery duel and
[04:46:12] then reset it to get archery duel
[04:46:16] again I got brow in
[04:46:21] it first message now I know what is
[04:46:24] trauma what the
[04:46:26] [ __ ] what does that have to do with
[04:46:28] anything we're
[04:46:32] doing oh
[04:46:35] things
[04:46:37] creation they moved on but as someone
[04:46:40] who's been diagnosed with depression
[04:46:42] think it's
[04:46:44] ignor I don't think it's inherently
[04:46:47] ignorant cuz okay not to go back on the
[04:46:50] topic but I think okay I do think it can
[04:46:53] help a lot of people find themselves or
[04:46:55] find solutions that help them which is
[04:46:57] good it's just a slippery slope
[04:46:59] sometimes like it it just you know it
[04:47:01] varies how did the Trotter Escape that's
[04:47:03] all
[04:47:08] and I also think it doesn't replace a
[04:47:09] professional which is important to
[04:47:12] understand but you know obviously not
[04:47:14] you know some countries are America and
[04:47:17] you don't have free healthcare
[04:47:20] is
[04:47:30] America professionals are overrated I
[04:47:34] okay all right all right I mean
[04:47:38] okay yeah when I'm sick I don't go see a
[04:47:40] doctor I just eat vegetables I take my
[04:47:42] vitamins hell yeah
[04:47:44] brother I take my
[04:47:59] vitamins oh why did I take
[04:48:03] that
[04:48:18] I'm just going to upgrade the five stars
[04:48:20] I don't feel like
[04:48:26] thinking to you're infected with yapping
[04:48:29] I think yapping is contagious this is
[04:48:31] the worst simulated Universe run I've
[04:48:33] ever seen no the [ __ ] it's
[04:48:39] not yapping dude yapping is contagious
[04:48:41] though if you have y if you are a y a
[04:48:44] okay if you are a a so-called yapper it
[04:48:47] is contagious to those around you they
[04:48:50] start yapping
[04:48:57] more I know why I eat before
[04:49:02] alting
[04:49:11] dude the worst is the the league player
[04:49:13] syndrome where you [ __ ] you press
[04:49:15] enter after every one word so you have
[04:49:17] to like text a league player and just
[04:49:19] just like disgusting in your DMs they
[04:49:21] like literally type one thing enter one
[04:49:23] thing enter one thing enter and then
[04:49:24] question mark
[04:49:26] enter it's actually like
[04:49:31] disgusting good damage
[04:49:40] punish
[04:49:52] evil they replac the space bar with
[04:49:55] enter yep pretty
[04:49:58] much I used to do that I am reformed
[04:50:02] now
[04:50:05] I was diagnosed with autism which helped
[04:50:07] me a lot with dropping out of
[04:50:09] SCH self diagnosis is valid but in my
[04:50:13] case having a diagnosis can help explain
[04:50:16] a lot not only to yourself but to
[04:50:19] other yeah yeah that's
[04:50:22] fair there's more
[04:50:25] toal will be swept away by the
[04:50:32] w
[04:50:52] overing people for money yeah I mean
[04:50:54] there's there's like some [ __ ] about how
[04:50:56] like even doctors like prescribe stuff
[04:50:59] that you don't need or like there's like
[04:51:00] a there's this like one thing something
[04:51:03] time like the lobby thing lobbying thing
[04:51:05] in America I'm not very educated on it
[04:51:07] but I know they're like prescribing some
[04:51:08] [ __ ] for everything and it was like
[04:51:10] useless or not needed or like
[04:51:14] opioids but uh I mean it's also like the
[04:51:18] reverse thing is the the the like psych
[04:51:22] student syndrome where you open your
[04:51:23] textbook and then you're like I have
[04:51:25] everything here like it like it looks
[04:51:27] like it applies to you like this has
[04:51:29] happened to me I've had three side
[04:51:30] classes maybe four I can't remember but
[04:51:32] I know had at least three
[04:51:34] it's very like what the [ __ ] so I mean
[04:51:37] you know pick your
[04:51:43] poison this combat needs up this
[04:51:49] is bad thing about ra when he kills
[04:51:51] someone with the Al he lose the sacks
[04:51:52] yeah the enemy yeah the the skill is
[04:51:54] nice cuz if you kill an enemy it the F
[04:51:57] attack goes to another enemy but the alt
[04:51:58] only stays on one which is unfortunate
[04:52:01] sometimes I wish it was like a personal
[04:52:03] buffer some [ __ ]
[04:52:09] but it again when yeah I
[04:52:16] agree P oh I should use the [ __ ]
[04:52:19] thing damn that
[04:52:22] sucks ice damage
[04:52:26] H wow okay well
[04:52:32] tragedy
[04:52:42] but yeah I mean I'm not pretending to
[04:52:44] know like I don't like you know I don't
[04:52:46] know everything but it bothered me Ione
[04:52:48] was like literally their reason for
[04:52:50] hating me was they tuned into my stream
[04:52:52] and I was like yeah I'm not going to
[04:52:54] take a random quiz I did as like the
[04:52:57] [ __ ] will of Jesus Christ and they
[04:52:59] were like how dare

[04:54:23] never be new off
[04:54:27] really why you crying pom
[04:54:32] pom
[04:54:41] how to this clear submissions work
[04:54:43] what's up Rome oh I literally filled it
[04:54:45] out on the plane I literally filled it
[04:54:46] out on the
[04:54:48] plane so what I made it to be is it's
[04:54:51] going to be basically I'm going to I'm
[04:54:53] going to make one of my mods go to
[04:54:54] [ __ ] the cage and have to fill it out
[04:54:56] make it the Forum but like I'll make the
[04:54:57] form but they have to like link it but H
[04:55:00] yeah zero pay eat your [ __ ] banana
[04:55:02] I'm kidding uh I'm kidding that's that's
[04:55:03] not how I treat my mods I love my mods
[04:55:05] they're great they love this I love them
[04:55:07] it's actually great anyways uh I'm going
[04:55:09] to do it it doesn't matter uh uh so
[04:55:11] basically you're gonna we're going to
[04:55:12] submit a this clears I think we're to do
[04:55:14] mostly scuffed ones but we might do some
[04:55:15] good ones too some fast ones I don't
[04:55:17] know uh and there'll be some helpful
[04:55:19] tips some advice most of it will just be
[04:55:20] for Content so we might you know I'm
[04:55:22] putting in the form in all caps that by
[04:55:25] submitting you are consenting to being
[04:55:27] made fun of just to avoid any uh uh
[04:55:29] problems so that's what's going to be
[04:55:31] happening it's going to be great uh
[04:55:32] it'll be in Discord I'll be you submit
[04:55:33] an unlisted video you don't have to
[04:55:34] censor anything you can include your
[04:55:36] builds and or characters if you want uh
[04:55:38] but it'll mostly just be that b clear
[04:55:40] whatever you can do or can't do whatever
[04:55:41] you're struggling with or clearing this
[04:55:43] when is the do ratio cosplay coming mod
[04:55:46] doct ratio cosplay I actually could it's
[04:55:49] not only scuffed runs I think we'll do I
[04:55:52] think scuff runs would be the funniest
[04:55:53] maybe we should do a scuff run Edition
[04:55:56] but I think allowing like every type of
[04:55:58] clear might be fine as well just to like
[04:56:00] you know there might be some like nine
[04:56:01] star clearers that are like fine or good
[04:56:03] that might be worth watching I just
[04:56:04] don't want it to be like strictly like
[04:56:06] Flex
[04:56:10] showcases strictly floor 12 no could be
[04:56:12] any
[04:56:14] floor or clear it'll be in the Discord
[04:56:17] SE Discord and the announcements uh I'll
[04:56:18] post it hopefully today but maybe
[04:56:20] probably like
[04:56:28] tomorrow floor 7 showcase well ideally
[04:56:31] it's the highest floor you're at not
[04:56:33] like a another floor like whatever floor
[04:56:34] you're struggling with
[04:56:37] or C like if you clear 12 then
[04:56:40] 12 like don't go
[04:56:47] backwards but I think it's good content
[04:56:49] to help people that like three starring
[04:56:50] 12 nine starring 12 or like six starring
[04:56:53] eight star or like 11 stuff like that
[04:56:55] but it could also be for people that n
[04:56:56] star how about 4 four okay all right
[04:57:01] anyways I'm going to end stream now
[04:57:02] because it's been five hours I like Dr
[04:57:03] rer though he feels good I don't think
[04:57:04] he's broken I don't think he's the same
[04:57:05] level as like jinglu blade but I think
[04:57:08] he's pretty good for like for a hunt
[04:57:09] carry he's pretty good and for a free
[04:57:11] character is really good so I think it's
[04:57:12] pretty good uh second Channel video will
[04:57:14] be out with some information on how to
[04:57:15] build them and play them and just fun
[04:57:17] stuff and then I will also make a full

[04:57:41] enjoy making content on it I just feel
[04:57:43] like streaming is harder than streaming
[04:57:44] genin because it's less it's less inter
[04:57:48] like I either have to focus or I auto
[04:57:50] battle in both of which it's harder for
[04:57:51] me to interact with chat or do like I
[04:57:53] don't know that's the only thing that I
[04:57:54] dislike about streaming it but I like
