[00:13:20] went to the mall and I'm like okay my
[00:13:21] glasses are [ __ ] I need to buy new
[00:13:23] ones so I bought two new pairs they're
[00:13:25] like on the way but before I did that I
[00:13:27] had to do an eye exam and I did an eye
[00:13:28] exam
[00:13:29] and uh so apparently I'm I'm astigmatic
[00:13:33] that's not true I have a stigmatism it
[00:13:35] is what it is uh and my eyes are
[00:13:37] incredibly light sensitive and uh uh uh
[00:13:40] uh my prescription stayed like almost
[00:13:42] the same though but anyways um so I I I
[00:13:48] I took an eye exam and then they were
[00:13:49] like like at the end the the the the the
[00:13:51] the oh no oh yeah also during the eye
[00:13:53] exam they're like yo can I put like
[00:13:55] these eye drops in your eyes they're
[00:13:56] going to make you like a bit blind for 2
[00:13:58] hours but to examine the back of your
[00:14:00] eye I'm like you know what sure and then
[00:14:02] they did that and like it kind of stung
[00:14:04] but it was fine you know I don't feel
[00:14:05] pain it is what it is um and then they
[00:14:08] were like examining my eye and the do
[00:14:12] the op optomet optometrist was
[00:14:15] like dude do you rub your eyes and like
[00:14:18] a little and then they're like I think
[00:14:20] like I like they're legit like I've
[00:14:22] never seen this before I think you're
[00:14:24] like eyelids are like you're like
[00:14:26] bleeding I'm like what and then so I
[00:14:29] panicked for like 5 minutes and I'm like
[00:14:30] wait and then they're like did you put
[00:14:31] like any makeup on I'm like oh [ __ ] so I
[00:14:34] think I think okay okay okay okay okay
[00:14:37] for I wasn't bleeding I think so I don't
[00:14:39] put makeup on ever but like you know
[00:14:42] last week when I I I [ __ ] did a shoot
[00:14:44] that I can't tell you guys about yet but
[00:14:45] just know that it's coming at have the
[00:14:46] cosplay a character they have [ __ ]
[00:14:48] red eyeliner so I still have some that I
[00:14:50] didn't properly clean off even though I
[00:14:52] took like five showers but apparently
[00:14:54] for makeup you need to like I don't know
[00:14:56] dude I used like a a wet wipe but I
[00:14:58] think you need like a special thing so I
[00:15:00] like I had like a bit of like red
[00:15:01] eyeliner stuck and they thought it was
[00:15:03] blood so it is what it is but it it
[00:15:05] wasn't so it's fine use oil what what
[00:15:08] the America's going to invade my house
[00:15:10] [ __ ] I can't use oil I I
[00:15:13] can't anyways I mean I I don't know I I
[00:15:15] bought a makeup remover wipe I didn't
[00:15:17] use it yet I'll use it tonight maybe
[00:15:18] I'll probably forget tomorrow it's fine
[00:15:21] it's fine I'm not pouring olive oil on
[00:15:23] my face did fangna give you any she
[00:15:25] doesn't have any I think I don't [ __ ]

[00:15:29] but I was I was going I bought some it's
[00:15:31] fine I bought some I bought some I
[00:15:32] bought some it's fine I bought some so
[00:15:34] that that was one thing but also my eyes
[00:15:36] were like [ __ ] and I was kind of tired
[00:15:37] I was still going to stream yesterday
[00:15:38] but I was like okay my eyes hurt but
[00:15:39] it's fine but then I'm pretty sure I got
[00:15:42] sick which is weird like I'm not
[00:15:43] actually sick but like my nose is stuffy
[00:15:46] and my throat hurts and I'm like how
[00:15:48] does that happen every I've gotten sick
[00:15:50] like four times in the past year I can't
[00:15:51] be sick so I'm in denial I think I'm
[00:15:54] fine maybe I'm allergic to something
[00:15:56] that I don't know I don't actually know
[00:15:58] but anyways so I I was kind of [ __ ]
[00:16:00] but I feel fine but if I lay down my
[00:16:02] nose is plugged but sitting up straight
[00:16:04] I'm
[00:16:10] okay you have an allergy against certain
[00:16:12] makeup no no no no cuz this happened
[00:16:14] like yesterday and I have had this
[00:16:15] makeup for a week cuz I can't I mean I
[00:16:18] thought I took it off I don't [ __ ]
[00:16:20] know okay to be fair before you guys see
[00:16:23] this content just to make like a public
[00:16:24] disclaimer I think I looked
[00:16:27] phenomenal at my base level and then I
[00:16:30] put a wig on that was like not cut
[00:16:33] properly and then I looked disgusting so
[00:16:35] when you see me in the cosplay don't
[00:16:37] laugh at the wig okay it is what it is
[00:16:38] but like outside of that I look fine it
[00:16:41] is what it is it it just is what it is
[00:16:42] it wasn't on me it wasn't on me it
[00:16:43] wasn't on me they they didn't have my
[00:16:45] [ __ ] it is what it is my head's
[00:16:47] big
[00:16:50] anyways anyways oh also I mean they they
[00:16:53] dude okay they also put like thickening
[00:16:56] spray in my hair so it doesn't look like
[00:16:57] I'm [ __ ] balding but not balding it
[00:16:59] just okay let's move on so that's what
[00:17:01] happened that's why I'm you know I'm
[00:17:03] here I didn't do that I stalled a little
[00:17:04] it is what it is but I uploaded some
[00:17:05] videos so you guys should be proud of me
[00:17:07] press one if you're proud of me I
[00:17:08] uploaded some backlogged videos also
[00:17:11] there's a bit of echo on my mic I bought
[00:17:12] a bunch of foam panels I'm going to
[00:17:13] stick them throughout the wall so there
[00:17:14] won't be that anymore anyways I uploaded
[00:17:16] two videos I reviewed 100 plus accounts
[00:17:19] and reviewing the biggest whale
[00:17:21] um I like them both go watch them I
[00:17:24] think they're great uh we're also we're
[00:17:25] clearing the backlog right now the abyss
[00:17:27] viewer reviews are coming out in a day
[00:17:29] or two I'd say two days probably oh two
[00:17:31] or three is more realistic but probably
[00:17:33] two and then
[00:17:36] um yeah there's a few others
[00:17:39] but um um um um um oh yeah the slice
[00:17:43] strongbox video also is done I'm just I
[00:17:45] have to record an intro there's no intro
[00:17:46] to the video so I'm going to record an
[00:17:47] intro and then send
[00:17:50] it uh is that it I don't know we're
[00:17:53] going to the backlog this week I want to
[00:17:55] okay before weathering waves comes out I
[00:17:56] want to record one or two videos on
[00:17:57] stream so we're probably going to do
[00:17:59] either fixing a cursed viewer account or
[00:18:02] uid reviews one of the two or something
[00:18:04] else it may be a bit after W but ideally
[00:18:06] before so exclamation mark Discord if
[00:18:08] you want to if I put any like viewer
[00:18:10] forms they'll be there actually I think
[00:18:12] we're also going to do viewer polls for
[00:18:13] clind so my uh second Channel I uploaded
[00:18:17] the arlino pull video people really like
[00:18:19] it it's doing really well shout out to
[00:18:21] Mari for that um I might do the same
[00:18:23] thing for Claren and maybe main Channel
[00:18:25] it so um
[00:18:29] yeah so we're going to do this again I
[00:18:30] think so if you guys want viewer pulls
[00:18:31] we'll probably do it day two we that's
[00:18:33] what we did with arino think we'll do it
[00:18:34] again
[00:18:36] um
[00:18:39] yeah so
[00:18:44] cool why you guys typing Suk bro there's
[00:18:47] the order of drip marketing like it's
[00:18:49] not like I'm [ __ ] dumb I've been
[00:18:50] playing this game for three [ __ ]
[00:18:51] years okay that's half your life okay go
[00:18:54] back to your [ __ ] kindergarten loser
[00:18:56] sorry how about star rail good question
[00:18:59] so a robin second Channel video is on
[00:19:00] its way it should be done I think
[00:19:02] tomorrow H realistically that means it's
[00:19:04] uploaded in about a month sorry and
[00:19:06] booill will probably get a video soon I
[00:19:08] already started looking into booill how
[00:19:10] I don't know but I did start looking
[00:19:12] into booill um I just need I almost said
[00:19:15] Hydro I need to get Harmony MC on my
[00:19:16] main account but yeah um so there's
[00:19:19] probably going to be a booill video and
[00:19:21] then waa when it comes out okay so I
[00:19:24] think what we're doing is there's going
[00:19:26] to uh I'm trying to prep like genin
[00:19:28] content like this that's like Evergreen
[00:19:29] to be ready while we play Wawa for a bit
[00:19:31] I think we're going to play wa a little
[00:19:33] bit when it's out and then see how it
[00:19:34] goes same with star rail uh uh the next
[00:19:37] patch cuz or next half cuz booill comes
[00:19:39] out is coming
[00:19:41] out uh I think so
[00:19:45] yeah yeah we'll see what happens um I'm
[00:19:47] trying to make a dude okay the problem
[00:19:50] is though is
[00:19:52] like dude if okay let's say weathering
[00:19:56] waves is fun and let's say zenis fun
[00:19:59] let's say like hypothetically okay does
[00:20:02] that mean I have to play four gacha
[00:20:03] games like I dude I I I [ __ ] like I
[00:20:06] might die like literally I might die
[00:20:09] even if one of the four is badged let's
[00:20:11] say one of the four sucks that's still
[00:20:13] three Goa games I I
[00:20:17] can't but yeah so we'll see uh I'm
[00:20:20] definitely going to make a weathering
[00:20:21] video when it's out see how it goes um
[00:20:24] and then I'm definitely going to make
[00:20:26] I'm definitely going to stream it as
[00:20:27] it's out as well
[00:20:29] um so we'll see uh I'll see if I don't
[00:20:32] know if it'll be sponsored or
[00:20:33] unsponsored ideally it is cuz free money
[00:20:37] but you know even if it isn't I'll play
[00:20:38] it uh for at least a week I'll say and
[00:20:41] then we'll see how it goes if people
[00:20:42] like it after a week if I like it we'll
[00:20:44] keep playing it if no one likes it then
[00:20:46] you know rib
[00:20:49] Bozo we'll
[00:20:52] see just I need to say something to my
[00:20:54] community right now there's a high
[00:20:57] likelihood I am very easily like I like
[00:20:59] a lot of games Okay um and and and you
[00:21:04] know I'm I'm a Glazer but I'm also uh
[00:21:07] okay this is [ __ ] you know I'm a
[00:21:08] complainer as well however if I see look
[00:21:12] okay it's the first week next week the
[00:21:15] first week of weaing waves it's going to
[00:21:16] be a lot
[00:21:18] of how do I say this nicely it's going
[00:21:21] to be a lot of clickbait okay and then
[00:21:23] there's going to be a lot of dumbass
[00:21:24] [ __ ] in my chat being like the
[00:21:25] first time I'm playing either either uh
[00:21:28] uh uh mothering or or or if I go play
[00:21:30] Star rail oh oox oh is genin dead oh did
[00:21:34] this game kill shut the [ __ ] up seek
[00:21:36] Jesus Allah whatever you believe in
[00:21:40] both please seek medical help okay the
[00:21:45] like at worst or best I don't know what
[00:21:48] the I mean okay at
[00:21:50] best best case scenario both games
[00:21:53] coexist and there's competition which is
[00:21:55] good for both games at worst
[00:21:59] it's not dying little bro anyways um
[00:22:03] we'll see what
[00:22:04] happens but I do think like it's a
[00:22:07] separate I even talked a bit with a few
[00:22:09] people about this it's a very separate
[00:22:12] um not Market cuz it's a gacha game but
[00:22:15] it's a very separate um sort of style
[00:22:18] and I think the endgame Loop is they
[00:22:21] kind of Chang it from Echo faring with
[00:22:22] your friends to like strong boxing
[00:22:24] everything cuz you just need main stats
[00:22:27] I'm pretty sure I'm still trying to
[00:22:28] figure figure out how everything like
[00:22:29] I'm trying to get into the like
[00:22:31] understanding the game well but
[00:22:34] um
[00:22:37] yeah but like you know I'm just saying
[00:22:40] this because I know there's going to be
[00:22:41] like probably a year of [ __ ] uh genin
[00:22:44] killer clickbait that's going to make me
[00:22:46] want to Silver Wolf myself in game um so
[00:22:50] you know be prepared but I'm still going
[00:22:51] to make videos on it uh or at least
[00:22:53] second Channel videos and and we'll
[00:22:54] stream it a bit so we'll see what
[00:22:55] happens we'll see if it's fun I'm
[00:22:57] excited I enjoyed the beta
[00:22:59] but uh I will say though full honesty
[00:23:01] before we do any hasht ad because we
[00:23:03] might I again I don't know yet um I
[00:23:06] enjoyed the combat a lot I think the
[00:23:08] story was absolute disgusting dog [ __ ]
[00:23:10] but it was also cbt2 so maybe like it
[00:23:13] was closed beta so it might get better
[00:23:14] in the in the real like I can't judge a
[00:23:15] game on Beta And if you're watching this
[00:23:17] we weather and waves you know I love you
[00:23:19] guys I'd love to work with you guys I'm
[00:23:20] just saying that the story was a bit
[00:23:21] underwhelming but it could be better
[00:23:23] like but when it's out it might be good
[00:23:24] I don't know I don't know I I'm not even
[00:23:26] a story player I play for combat so what
[00:23:27] the [ __ ] do I don't take me seriously I
[00:23:30] did like the guy with the [ __ ] zipper
[00:23:31] though I think the the guy was really
[00:23:33] like the characters are really cool and
[00:23:35] the um the um what is it called the
[00:23:38] combat was cool so we'll
[00:23:39] see uh
[00:23:42] yeah but I'm still doing a bit of like
[00:23:44] Research into that like I want to
[00:23:45] understand how it works so that if I
[00:23:47] make a video your release I'm not just
[00:23:48] yapping like generic like hey guys play
[00:23:51] the game so yeah when no story Quest
[00:23:56] it's not 10 hours B
[00:24:00] oh yeah we have to do arino Quest I
[00:24:05] forgot gen didn't have better start I
[00:24:07] don't know I didn't play any of genin
[00:24:08] betas so I'm not good at knowing how
[00:24:10] games Evol I played star rail beta to be
[00:24:13] fair I did play Star rail beta I
[00:24:15] didn't that hurt I didn't play G beta I
[00:24:17] wasn't a gacha gamer I I didn't in fact
[00:24:19] I watched gacha Gamer's tier list and I
[00:24:21] thought Bennett sucked but no disrespect
[00:24:23] that was 1.0 it is what it is but
[00:24:24] anyways um I I wasn't a gacha player um
[00:24:28] but yeah sorry for the stra I'm sorry I
[00:24:30] didn't mean to I no disrespect man but
[00:24:33] I'm sorry um but cuz dude the jaff was
[00:24:36] like yo I just pulled Bennett is he good
[00:24:38] I'm like no you can your e knocks you
[00:24:41] off cliffs and then he's like
[00:24:43] oh anyways um anyways uh yeah so we'll
[00:24:49] see I'm excited
[00:24:52] though what was I talking about oh
[00:24:56] W oh yeah but yeah I didn't know what
[00:24:58] genin's like I didn't play the beta so I
[00:25:01] can't tell if like it was worse or
[00:25:03] better or whatever the only thing I saw
[00:25:05] were like the the aaka simps that's
[00:25:07] literally it like I I the only beta
[00:25:09] thing oh and Shia I saw Shia footage
[00:25:10] actually I I saw Shia
[00:25:15] footage like oh my God aaka has a fiance
[00:25:18] oh my
[00:25:19] God so yeah and I saw the sh footage
[00:25:22] before I started playing my friend who
[00:25:24] got me into genin was like yo you'd like
[00:25:26] this character and I was just Chow I'm
[00:25:27] like I agree
[00:25:31] um what else is there yeah I think um
[00:25:34] but genton was
[00:25:39] uh I'm trying to think what got me to
[00:25:42] keep playing after day one I think it
[00:25:43] was just like it was just fun to [ __ ]
[00:25:45] pilot the characters and like the
[00:25:47] graphics and [ __ ] so I I feel a similar
[00:25:50] way like that's not a hard thing
[00:25:52] well yeah I don't know I'm pretty
[00:25:55] simple-minded when it comes to that
[00:25:56] stuff like I I I did a sponsor stream
[00:25:58] for Grand blue fantasy and then I woke
[00:26:00] up the next morning and I was like I
[00:26:01] want to play this so like I'm very like
[00:26:03] and that game's good but like I'm very
[00:26:05] like usually if I like a game and if I
[00:26:08] play a game and other people like it
[00:26:10] like my friends are playing it and it's
[00:26:11] not like a bad game I'll probably like
[00:26:13] it so I'm pretty easy to
[00:26:17] please unless the game devs are just
[00:26:19] like [ __ ] you no endgame no [ __ ]
[00:26:22] anything and then I'm
[00:26:24] like
[00:26:26] anyways uh so yeah yeah that was our our
[00:26:29] our our pre- stalling
[00:26:31] ritual
[00:26:34] aware
[00:26:43] aware
[00:26:45] aware why are you still playing true I
[00:26:48] mean I love the game I just you know
[00:26:50] there's a lot of stuff that needs
[00:26:52] Improvement but also okay I also see
[00:26:54] this argument I see a disingenuous
[00:26:56] take I'm going to be honest I see a
[00:26:59] disingenuous take from a lot of uh genin
[00:27:01] haters and listen I want to say that I'm
[00:27:03] the biggest hater I hate the way that
[00:27:05] you walk the way that you talk the way
[00:27:06] that you dress I I I I you know I'm a
[00:27:09] vocal complainer but a lot of [ __ ] that
[00:27:11] I don't like however I see a
[00:27:13] disingenuous argument that's like oh if
[00:27:15] you don't like your game stop playing it
[00:27:16] why are you playing it oh it's just your
[00:27:17] job you have to [ __ ] if you're
[00:27:19] cheering for a football team and one of
[00:27:21] the players sucks dick and you're
[00:27:22] complaining are you going to be like oh
[00:27:24] just switch [ __ ] pick another team to
[00:27:26] the vote for no [ __ ] I like this
[00:27:28] thing I wanted to do better and and why
[00:27:30] would you be like oh just quit [ __ ]
[00:27:32] quit your life sorry in game don't quit
[00:27:34] your life you can actually do great
[00:27:36] things if you put your mind to it I'm
[00:27:38] sorry but anyways that was [ __ ] I'm
[00:27:40] actually sorry no but uh yeah so that's
[00:27:43] where it comes from um but that's also
[00:27:46] why like I like playing other games too
[00:27:48] that feel like they like reward me a bit
[00:27:49] better you know like starl gives me a
[00:27:52] lot of new [ __ ] I'm like oh this is Cool
[00:27:54] weing Waves might give us stuff out of
[00:27:56] [ __ ] like competition you know that's
[00:27:59] cool so um
[00:28:04] T like Elden ring dude okay I think
[00:28:07] we're actually going to Marathon it no
[00:28:09] copage no
[00:28:11] glage we will We Will We Will We Will We
[00:28:13] Will We Will not yet though but like we
[00:28:15] will we will not copium not
[00:28:19] copium not
[00:28:26] copium we will
[00:28:29] copying Kai yes but we've been wanting
[00:28:31] to do this for like 2 years I'll
[00:28:33] probably do it in another two years I'm
[00:28:34] just saying we will I'm just saying we
[00:28:36] will I don't know when I'm just saying
[00:28:38] we will I just don't want to start it
[00:28:40] and then never finish it you get me I'm
[00:28:42] not adding glorp actually I gorp is a
[00:28:44] pretty good emote I'm adding
[00:28:46] glorp um
[00:28:50] glorp but yeah so those are my thoughts
[00:28:52] I'm definitely going to play wa though
[00:28:53] and we'll see if it's good or not but
[00:28:55] I'm definitely going to play it
[00:28:56] for yeah
[00:28:59] oh I already have
[00:29:02] it
[00:29:09] g okay is there anything else did I
[00:29:11] cover what I wanted to the app about I
[00:29:13] don't even I I didn't even plan to Yap
[00:29:14] about anything but I just started
[00:29:15] yapping is there anything else to ypp
[00:29:19] about I think it'll be
[00:29:24] fun be free to play for once in Wawa
[00:29:27] Pepe w
[00:29:34] um I don't know about that one maybe I
[00:29:37] don't I don't see the I think as a
[00:29:40] streamer
[00:29:42] it's I think it's commendable to be free
[00:29:44] to play especially as a normal like
[00:29:47] casual player because like you know use
[00:29:50] your money on useful
[00:29:52] things but if I want to be like there's
[00:29:54] a chance I'm serious about the game
[00:29:56] there's a chance I'm not if I am then I
[00:29:57] want want to get characters so that I
[00:29:59] can play them and review them and build
[00:30:00] them and all that but I don't know yet
[00:30:03] like I don't know if I'm just playing it
[00:30:05] for fun or if I'm going to go a bit
[00:30:06] sweaty in it I'm not sure I'm not going
[00:30:08] to like you know constellation whatever
[00:30:10] their equivalent of constellations is
[00:30:12] I'm not going to like you know outside
[00:30:14] of my sha that's like what I do with
[00:30:15] genin right well see one but yeah we'll
[00:30:19] see I think a lot of it is kind of um
[00:30:23] it's a it's a weird
[00:30:25] Duality it's a weird Duality where it's
[00:30:27] like I want people I'm like H how do I
[00:30:31] how do I phrase this
[00:30:33] it's a good thing to be free to play
[00:30:35] like you should like you know spend
[00:30:37] money on what brings you happiness if
[00:30:39] you want to [ __ ] spend money for a
[00:30:40] character or a weapon or whatever and
[00:30:41] you think it's worth do it but like
[00:30:43] don't feel forc to but I think for me
[00:30:47] it's it's like there's some like the
[00:30:49] other gacha games I play like off stream
[00:30:51] I haven't like I haven't spent in
[00:30:52] [ __ ] AFK Journey or like Ark Knights
[00:30:54] I did spend in Cookie Run Kingdom
[00:30:56] actually so I'm kind of you know uh but
[00:30:57] we I'll talk about that one but with a a
[00:31:00] game like weaing like if I can't pull
[00:31:03] for GN cuz like I don't have the [ __ ]
[00:31:05] gems there's a higher likelihood I never
[00:31:07] touch the game again like a lot of games
[00:31:09] I play for the characters so yeah we'll
[00:31:12] see though um and also it's like if I do
[00:31:14] want to make content about it I would
[00:31:15] need the characters to actually make
[00:31:17] content about it and know how they play
[00:31:19] like I don't [ __ ] I can't tell you
[00:31:20] how to build claraa although I'm pretty
[00:31:22] sure you just [ __ ] play her like a
[00:31:23] generic ass tank with full up attacks
[00:31:25] because I don't [ __ ] have her so I
[00:31:26] haven't looked into her and it's like I
[00:31:28] wish I had her but I'm not going to
[00:31:29] whale on the standard
[00:31:31] Banner um so I I don't think
[00:31:34] I'll yeah also it's a little
[00:31:48] bit all right we'll
[00:31:50] see no
[00:31:53] claraa but also okay okay I have to say
[00:31:56] this too I have to say this too [ __ ]
[00:31:59] okay be freeo play players amazing freeo
[00:32:02] play twitch frogs like the twitch
[00:32:04] Chatters that are like oh I'm free to
[00:32:06] play and I cleared faster than you you
[00:32:08] suck [ __ ] no one asked okay if
[00:32:11] let's say I'm a free to play streamer
[00:32:12] okay and I'm obviously the most talented
[00:32:14] player that has ever graced a [ __ ]
[00:32:15] mouse and keyboard and I clear the
[00:32:17] hardest content you're going to go in
[00:32:19] other streamers chats and be like oh oh
[00:32:21] this guy did this free to play and then
[00:32:22] I'm going to be [ __ ]
[00:32:25] C okay sorry
[00:32:31] sorry all right let's
[00:32:35] cream
[00:32:40] B oh my God I'm blooming oh my God I'm
[00:32:53] blooming we'll see though like you know
[00:32:57] this is 100 100% skill ISU on my part
[00:33:00] but how do you switch characters on
[00:33:02] genin so fast I just started playing
[00:33:05] genin on the o because I bought one for
[00:33:07] my birthday and
[00:33:09] previously pH I started playing G on the
[00:33:11] OC years oh PC any advice how do you
[00:33:14] switch characters so fast what do you
[00:33:16] mean like like party switch or like
[00:33:18] build switch or
[00:33:20] like okay so you can just press the L
[00:33:23] key if that's what you mean oh like swap
[00:33:27] yeah you press 1 2 3
[00:33:29] before you know something I discovered
[00:33:31] recently though like maybe a few months
[00:33:33] ago which is recent given the fact I've
[00:33:35] been playing this game for three and a
[00:33:36] half years you can hold on one of these
[00:33:39] buttons and then it pulls up the team
[00:33:41] thing like on mobile you can just like I
[00:33:43] didn't know you could do that I saw Fang
[00:33:45] do it I'm like what the [ __ ] I didn't
[00:33:46] know you could do that it's kind of
[00:33:48] useless but on mobile it's pretty cool
[00:33:49] you can like hold this okay well I mean
[00:33:52] I interrupted it but wait how do I boom
[00:33:56] yeah it's useless but you
[00:33:59] know I didn't know that it was added
[00:34:02] recently oh really took me months to
[00:34:05] find about the tab wheel thing okay I do
[00:34:07] this literally all the time it's my way
[00:34:09] of just fidgeting getch doesn't really
[00:34:11] have good well I mean the fidgeting is
[00:34:12] not bad actually the game with the worst
[00:34:13] fidgeting and I know this doesn't matter
[00:34:15] at all so please don't get on my [ __ ]
[00:34:17] ass star rail uh Supremacy frogs I can't
[00:34:20] fidget as satisfyingly in Star rail like
[00:34:23] valerent I'm like inspecting my knife
[00:34:24] genin I'm doing like dumb [ __ ] star rail
[00:34:26] like I can't even jump
[00:34:28] it is what it is though I mean you know
[00:34:30] it's
[00:34:34] fine cuz there's actual content okay
[00:34:36] true true I just got
[00:34:40] roasted you can spin true you can
[00:34:45] spin I have to pee so bad I just started
[00:34:48] stream maintaining APM dude I I [ __ ]
[00:34:51] grew up with Starcraft I was 120 APM
[00:34:55] 12-year-old what the [ __ ] do you want me
[00:34:56] to do oh I just guessed pound and then
[00:34:58] Hound what the [ __ ] is wrong with me
[00:35:00] wait I for wait wait wait wait let me
[00:35:02] try let me
[00:35:16] try ball me
[00:35:21] thoughts I'm so [ __ ] I'm so
[00:35:26] [ __ ] and
[00:35:30] [ __ ] there's no more
[00:35:40] vowels oh [ __ ] the only vowel we have is
[00:35:46] a what dude
[00:35:50] I what the [ __ ] I just spit everywhere
[00:35:53] what the [ __ ] is this um
[00:35:56] am oh oh no no it could be S no it the
[00:36:00] second letter can't be a like it can't
[00:36:03] be a vowel so it has to start with a is
[00:36:05] my logic so I think it's
[00:36:09] a
[00:36:13] ass M
[00:36:22] amsa okay it's a something a oh M has to
[00:36:26] be here I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure

[01:41:28] doesn't look like a guy
[01:41:30] name I mean Dalia I could be
[01:41:38] anything scroll down a
[01:41:41] bit okay
[01:41:49] dude it sounds like the name of a flower
[01:41:52] I feel like next okay no leakers okay
[01:41:54] here's my my theory okay for the it is
[01:41:56] the name of a flower
[01:42:00] oh so you're saying men can't like
[01:42:02] flowers Jeff is that what you're saying
[01:42:03] you're saying we can't like flowers yeah
[01:42:05] [ __ ] you okay Bloom okay okay to give an
[01:42:10] extended Olive Ranch to this [ __ ]
[01:42:12] character that's never coming out I my
[01:42:15] theory is that after natland and like
[01:42:18] chzn and Canaria we go back to monat and
[01:42:21] then there's a more monat cuz like still
[01:42:23] a lot of uncapped lore Al's like I'm
[01:42:25] going to Nuke the city and Ka is like
[01:42:27] yeah my great great great
[01:42:30] grandp Quebec reference if you know you
[01:42:32] know uh was like yeah he's like [ __ ]
[01:42:35] U historical listening he's like a a bad
[01:42:39] person so I feel like we're going back
[01:42:41] to monat and at that point we might get
[01:42:42] this character I feel like that's when
[01:42:43] we get new monan
[01:42:45] thoughts so like
[01:42:49] yeah do you think we'll have raids by
[01:42:51] then no dud don't say no come
[01:43:02] on
[01:43:04] all thorny
[01:43:12] benevolence are there any free fourstar
[01:43:14] pyro po arm DPSS from Le with no ICD on
[01:43:18] their burst which can utilize this piece
[01:43:21] see there actually aren't
[01:43:23] because there is not a single fourar
[01:43:26] pyro unit from like fourar fourar power
[01:43:31] arm unit from Leo that has no ICD on
[01:43:34] their burst true cuz the first hits have
[01:43:36] ICD they do true also HP subset wasted
[01:43:40] rip
[01:43:41] Bozo true
[01:43:45] also getting em should be impossible
[01:43:47] what dude stop stop it it's microscopic

[02:01:22] like like like at least Masters in
[02:01:24] League it's like it's a game that's been
[02:01:25] out for like 10 [ __ ] well more more
[02:01:28] than 10 [ __ ] years like what 15 years
[02:01:31] some [ __ ] like that and and you're
[02:01:34] you're you're you're playing based on
[02:01:36] the knowledge of of 15 years worth of
[02:01:39] players true roast them roast them it
[02:01:42] actually requires a lot of knowledge to
[02:01:44] reach the the the true to reach like

[02:28:08] waiting for get her you know you want to
[02:28:12] get it twisted gamble get it twisted
[02:28:16] Gamble
[02:28:25] 2 hours for Asia
[02:28:30] oh no I shouldn't oh but I want to Chad
[02:28:33] should I pull my freeo playay account I
[02:28:35] really want arino but it would defeat
[02:28:37] the purpose I feel like I want to play
[02:28:38] my free playay account without like a
[02:28:39] good F like the only five star I want to
[02:28:41] use is chia I don't want to use AR Lino
[02:28:43] on it but I kind of want to have
[02:28:47] her that's probably useless like
[02:28:56] this you could just pull and not
[02:29:01] play Shia cucked again well Shia is
[02:29:05] um okay full bias aside Shia becomes
[02:29:09] really good but only if you're like like
[02:29:12] not if you're like if it's a first he's
[02:29:13] not a high value five star to pull until
[02:29:15] you have other five stars like he only
[02:29:17] becomes really good when you have like
[02:29:19] all the other [ __ ] and I don't have that
[02:29:21] on my free playay account so it's going
[02:29:23] to be fun like I want to [ __ ] play CZ
[02:29:25] fars on Bennett uh Shia I think it's
[02:29:33] fun arino can be your second team okay
[02:29:36] but like no one

[02:59:10] Fields crafting some weing wave stuff
[02:59:12] and their word for constellation is some
[02:59:14] other thing too so now I have to learn
[02:59:16] constellation idolon and what ever that

[02:59:21] one it's
[02:59:28] fine who is he imitating
[02:59:40] keemstar let's get right into the

[02:59:53] Raven I'll
[02:59:56] I'll okay I was going to say I'll punish

[03:00:01] played it I think I was going to and
[03:00:04] then I watched fob play it I was like

[03:10:45] you're
[03:10:46] doing they're good builds
[03:10:53] oh Chad we have the opportunity to do
[03:10:55] the funniest thing
[03:10:58] ever you know what you should do Bart
[03:11:00] for your birthday you should visit a uh
[03:11:02] domain released in a version after Ena
[03:11:06] Zuma around 2.6 2.5 uh when the chasm
[03:11:10] came out it is a domain that has two
[03:11:13] artifact sets one of which is uh
[03:11:16] Vermilion hereafter it's good for Shia
[03:11:19] and one of and the other of which is
[03:11:21] aatos set best in slot echo of an
[03:11:26] offering and if you go for that set your
[03:11:28] Ayo May uh see an upgrade now would I
[03:11:34] recommend farming it
[03:11:37] no but you
[03:11:39] could I'm from Brazil I have way too
[03:11:41] high of a ping okay well glad is much
[03:11:44] more efficient anyways uh good flower
[03:11:48] good feather amazing
[03:11:50] Sands amazing
[03:11:54] goblet zff ciret but really
[03:12:00] good uh is your cir crit rate it is it's
[03:12:03] hard to have as the rank one IO Miss
[03:12:05] spitter [ __ ] you whoever's actually I'm
[03:12:07] I'm rank one I know it says rank two
[03:12:09] right now but like you don't have it AO
[03:12:10] like I do [ __ ] you as the rank one IO in
[03:12:13] the world uh on mlit uh I know that it's
[03:12:16] really hard to have enough crit rate so
[03:12:18] ideally you get more crit rate but it's
[03:12:19] not easy because like you have 12 you
[03:12:22] have seven you have seven you okay well
[03:12:24] you can have a bit more but it's hard to
[03:12:26] get more so I I I understand
[03:12:29] it your builds are good
[03:12:33] though yep not really much advice they
[03:12:36] can give honestly wait what's that where
[03:12:38] you on on
[03:12:41] her
[03:12:42] oh that's fine
[03:12:56] Crimson Moon
[03:12:58] glad
[03:13:06] 1086 mine's
[03:13:12] better my frea feels like it's perfect
[03:13:15] but I want to improve
[03:13:17] okay I'll give you harsh criticism
[03:13:19] then all right first of
[03:13:22] all second of all this is good um that's
[03:13:26] a good
[03:13:29] off what's your sounds HP goblet
[03:13:34] HP okay uh I'm going to tell you to use
[03:13:37] the optimizer but I'm going to be real
[03:13:38] with
[03:13:43] you I feel like if you're doing HP HP
[03:13:47] and all of your sub stats are into HP uh
[03:13:50] crit starts to become a bit more
[03:13:52] significantly valuable than um otherwise
[03:13:56] stated do you have
[03:13:58] enough yeah you do I mean it's good like
[03:14:01] you don't really need to improve it but
[03:14:03] you could invest into a little bit more
[03:14:04] crit uh because you have another 16 crit
[03:14:08] rate so what is this that's [ __ ] oh
[03:14:10] my God the math on 67 plus 16 I can do
[03:14:13] this uh [ __ ] plus 3 70 plus 10 83
[03:14:17] crit rate 83 it's 83 I mean this is
[03:14:20] still pretty balanced I mean it's a bit
[03:14:22] skewed towards crit rate but it's
[03:14:30] fine not at 40K I mean
[03:14:34] so that's fine I mean you are at 40K
[03:14:39] but yeah you could run double Hydro too
[03:14:42] it depends what your team is I guess you
[03:14:44] might be running double Hydro
[03:14:48] but I mean like your frea is really good
[03:14:49] there's no reason to improve it if you
[03:14:51] want to you could run the optimizer and
[03:14:52] see what it tells you or you could try
[03:14:54] to like there's no like if I'm looking
[03:14:56] youra there's nothing where I'm like
[03:14:57] okay that's bad like all of it's fine
[03:14:59] agre
[03:15:01] agre uh let me look
[03:15:04] at let me look something up
[03:15:06] leaderboards finina

[03:15:34] whoa
[03:15:37] yeah yeah all these Arenas like I look
[03:15:40] at the leaderboards just to see I guess
[03:15:42] I could show it all these Aras have like
[03:15:45] [ __ ] like 40 something KP and they're
[03:15:47] just like insane crit value well not all
[03:15:50] they're not that insane but like
[03:15:51] considering the ER and the HP they're
[03:15:53] pretty insane I guess it's not that much
[03:15:55] ER actually because of festering
[03:15:57] whatever I mean this website's cringe
[03:15:58] but
[03:16:27] what the [ __ ] is on my
[03:16:29] finina festering desire

[03:16:38] that ER I need that
[03:16:40] ER could use this if I don't okay okay
[03:16:44] okay

[03:35:18] that on purpose
[03:35:46] missing dailies dude ah
[03:35:50] [ __ ] [ __ ] I wanted to do the
[03:35:53] event I mean oh we did it okay cool wait
[03:35:57] let
[03:36:01] me wait do I have to teleport to a
[03:36:03] different place for each song what the
[03:36:11] [ __ ] no oh okay why were there like
[03:36:14] music notes on the mini map is that like
[03:36:15] the quest maybe it's the C
[03:36:18] Quest thank you
[03:36:32] for bless you
[03:36:36] thanks I guess these are other things I
[03:36:38] see also I have something to say but you
[03:36:41] guys might not like it let me blow my
[03:36:43] nose again
[03:37:02] okay here's what I have to say I'm
[03:37:03] pretty sure this event gives you
[03:37:05] literally the worst possible choice of a
[03:37:08] or like the worst possible character you
[03:37:11] could get for
[03:37:13] free and I'm not saying Goro is is the
[03:37:15] worst character he isn't but you get a
[03:37:18] free Goro and new accounts can't [ __ ]
[03:37:20] make use of a Goro cuz he's only good in
[03:37:21] like two teams then you like existing
[03:37:24] players probably don't want an extra
[03:37:25] [ __ ] Goro unless you're a Geo player
[03:37:27] that's literally it not even just Gio
[03:37:29] you have to play a defense scaling Gio
[03:37:32] or like a full Geo team I feel like any
[03:37:35] almost any other fourstar would be
[03:37:37] better
[03:37:38] free including yeah including Dory some
[03:37:41] [ __ ] like less than like not that
[03:37:43] good accounts could use Dory if you off
[03:37:45] kie Kookie was free but you might have
[03:37:48] missed
[03:37:50] her well it is what it
[03:37:56] is but Goro does have good cons so if
[03:37:59] you're missing like C6 or
[03:38:06] C4 why do I need to
[03:38:09] teleport bad take I fear I mean it's
[03:38:11] it's not even like a personal opinion
[03:38:13] it's just I mean I guess it isn't a
[03:38:15] person
[03:38:16] opinion but in like in the scheme of
[03:38:19] things the amount of the percentage of
[03:38:21] accounts the percentage of accounts that
[03:38:23] can make use of Goro are like
[03:38:25] significantly lower than like 90% of
[03:38:27] characters Kookie was never
[03:38:31] free really I guess official was free
[03:38:34] who was I thinking of maybe I was
[03:38:36] thinking of official I don't
[03:38:37] know Kookie
[03:38:44] [Music]
[03:38:46] oh maybe it was just official my fault
[03:38:49] oh yeah Dory was free um never
[03:38:55] mind AO was
