[00:08:15] open that's all content that's all
[00:08:18] content that's all content that's all
[00:08:21] content oh also before we get into
[00:08:23] anything I think I'm going to remake A
[00:08:25] Tik Tok account not because there's
[00:08:27] anything wrong with this one but there
[00:08:28] is something wrong with this one and I
[00:08:29] want to change my region for many
[00:08:31] reasons cuz we're like Canada locked for
[00:08:33] some reason so I think I'm going to make
[00:08:34] a new one and delete this and then make
[00:08:36] a new one I'll let you guys know and
[00:08:37] we'll actually be posting more shorts on

[00:38:35] also 4.5 is perfect patch for Elden ring
[00:38:38] stream
[00:38:40] true but chori's coming whoa chori whoa
[00:38:47] chori okay
[00:38:51] chat Let's Get
[00:38:54] Serious so okay
[00:39:00] I was
[00:39:03] debating who is
[00:39:06] flip I was debating hey actually I can
[00:39:10] still play music in the
[00:39:18] background I was debating hey should we
[00:39:21] should we rank every character and
[00:39:23] weapon in the new banner and I was
[00:39:25] thinking about it and
[00:39:27] you know I might right I was like okay
[00:39:29] like let me put them all here and for
[00:39:32] the weapons there's like a lot to talk
[00:39:33] about sure right we we we did a standard
[00:39:35] Banner thing on stream a while ago I
[00:39:38] still have
[00:39:39] it but for the characters I was thinking
[00:39:42] about it and I was like if I was making
[00:39:43] an actual tier list like four of these
[00:39:45] characters would be in the same tier
[00:39:47] like dude I'm sorry but like so many of
[00:39:50] these characters are like about as good
[00:39:52] as one another like it's not like
[00:39:53] they're like okay like I like I don't
[00:39:56] know I don't know I don't know I don't
[00:39:57] know I don't know
[00:40:00] it it's like ranking them feels weird
[00:40:03] cuz like none of them are like s tier
[00:40:06] and none of them are like complete
[00:40:10] garbage and Gan is like like okay for
[00:40:13] example right I think Gina's really good
[00:40:15] and got a lot better with finina but
[00:40:16] choosing to pull for her when most of
[00:40:19] the time Shen Yun is
[00:40:21] like either as good as Jean or way
[00:40:25] better in some teams
[00:40:27] right you
[00:40:30] know um it's like hard to Advocate
[00:40:33] choosing her but she's good like if you
[00:40:35] have Jee user but like choosing her is
[00:40:37] is not
[00:40:39] recommended
[00:40:40] um I think duuke is actually pretty good
[00:40:43] right now I don't think
[00:40:47] he's I actually think Duo got a lot
[00:40:49] better I I'm not even coping right now I
[00:40:51] actually think the Luke got a lot better
[00:40:52] I actually think the Luke's actually not
[00:40:54] bad right now I think the Luke's
[00:40:56] actually pretty good right now did I did
[00:40:57] I make that clear I repeated that
[00:40:58] sentence five times I think the Luke's
[00:41:00] actually good now um s tier Mona okay
[00:41:05] I'm going to get a lot of [ __ ] for this
[00:41:07] because I know everyone loves Mona but
[00:41:11] unironically I have never had fun
[00:41:13] playing Mona I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[00:41:16] sorry she's very versatile she can be
[00:41:19] used in many teams when you need uh like
[00:41:22] off field or it's not super off field
[00:41:25] Hydro but like a an okay I like freeze
[00:41:27] right uh I said many teams but it's
[00:41:29] mostly like freeze um but it's just like
[00:41:34] kokomi feels so much better mona can
[00:41:37] help for like screenshots like a big
[00:41:39] number um but feeling her like playing
[00:41:42] her is like really clunky it's nice for
[00:41:45] like oh I just hit a million damage and
[00:41:46] it's nice for um try plunge Mona plunge
[00:41:50] Mona is disgusting dude you get stunned
[00:41:53] in [ __ ] Dash animation it actually
[00:41:55] made me want to want to commit
[00:41:57] unreasonable crimes in a video game I I

[00:42:15] uh let's do a normal Catalyst right like
[00:42:17] uh y whatever would you do without me
[00:42:20] look okay look so if I were to spam
[00:42:23] plunge you do like Dash cancel jump
[00:42:25] Plunge cancel jump plunge with Mona you
[00:42:29] can't [ __ ] look look look let me show
[00:42:31] you this is how you do it with the eye
[00:42:34] right right okay I [ __ ] it up but like
[00:42:37] like that and then like that with
[00:42:40] Mona
[00:42:41] I I can't D it's fine it's okay it's
[00:42:45] just a lot more annoying um but like
[00:42:47] that's not Mona's main team
[00:42:52] anyways uh
[00:42:54] yeah anyways
[00:42:57] I think she's she's cool for a standard
[00:42:59] character because there's a lot of times
[00:43:00] when you don't have enough Hydra on your
[00:43:01] account and you can use her off field
[00:43:03] you can freeze team with her she's good
[00:43:04] with like g
[00:43:05] whatever bro just jump
[00:43:09] cancel are you telling me to jump cancel
[00:43:12] a plch yeah you can normal cancel it you
[00:43:14] could you could normal sure
[00:43:18] but first of all this isn't a Shan Yun
[00:43:21] stream segment this is about Mona and
[00:43:23] yeah you can you can do some stuff to
[00:43:25] make your plunging field better but the
[00:43:27] Dash feels very clunky and that's the
[00:43:29] point that's all I'm trying to say um
[00:43:33] but you know she can go like five or
[00:43:35] thrilling tails and um she's
[00:43:38] decent I think she's
[00:43:40] decent uh I also
[00:43:47] think CLE okay I think I think I think
[00:43:49] if you're still a CLE player uh it's
[00:43:52] time to you know uh uh be like oh I I
[00:43:54] love CLE but uh okay Shen yun's out
[00:43:58] farina's
[00:43:59] out all right let's just let's just call
[00:44:02] it duuk is now better uh well not now
[00:44:04] better is better period uh you can you
[00:44:06] can mono pyro her you can you can do
[00:44:08] some things but um like she's all right
[00:44:11] but she's not
[00:44:14] great duuk is a worse DPS than C6
[00:44:20] Bennett that is
[00:44:22] true okay
[00:44:25] dude
[00:44:27] CLE plus Bennett finina Shan
[00:44:32] Yun I mean I guess what
[00:44:35] even I guess if you can make like I
[00:44:37] guess why can't I
[00:44:40] mean but Del's plch scaling is really
[00:44:43] high CLE reverse VAP
[00:44:47] Pina I
[00:44:51] guess maybe they're the same I don't
[00:44:54] like that though
[00:45:01] Collision plunge yeah collision's a lot
[00:45:03] easier with the Luke too because he has
[00:45:04] a big ass
[00:45:07] Claymore I don't know I don't see how um
[00:45:11] I don't see a world where
[00:45:15] CLE yeah like du's like okay here's the
[00:45:19] thing I think duuke like mediocre teams
[00:45:22] are pretty much just him being carried
[00:45:24] and then deluke really good team which
[00:45:26] is one team only he actually feels
[00:45:28] really strong
[00:45:31] so
[00:45:35] yeah anyways that's why I think the
[00:45:37] character part is relevant because
[00:45:38] almost all of these characters I rank
[00:45:40] very similarly like I think the they're
[00:45:42] like pretty similar I think Mona's
[00:45:44] pretty like a bit more flexible cuz
[00:45:45] she's a support but still pretty similar
[00:45:47] YULA is like good if you have like
[00:45:49] finina and or Ryden ideally both but
[00:45:51] like similar and then albo's flexible
[00:45:54] but also similar so it's like I don't
[00:45:57] know I don't I don't like talking about
[00:45:59] these characters cuz they're all the
[00:46:00] [ __ ] same like they they do different
[00:46:02] things but they're like pretty similar I
[00:46:03] think C's not that great though uh but
[00:46:06] I'm sure someone's going to be like
[00:46:08] actually you're
[00:46:11] wrong anyways but the weapons I want to
[00:46:14] talk
[00:46:16] about because the weapons I you know I
[00:46:20] want to talk
[00:46:24] about
[00:46:28] the only thing is okay I'm going to say
[00:46:29] it the only thing is my perception of
[00:46:31] CLE stopped before 4.0 so I don't know
[00:46:34] if she got any better with finina and
[00:46:35] oranyan and I know people like oh yeah
[00:46:37] obviously but like I don't know if she
[00:46:38] actually got better or if it's just like
[00:46:40] okay she's a bit better but she's still
[00:46:41] worse than others that's the only thing
[00:46:42] I'm not trly I uh uh Mona's cool but
[00:46:44] clunky as [ __ ] uh and usually kokomi is
[00:46:47] better so it's like I would choose K
[00:46:49] like I would always go for KI and if you
[00:46:51] get amona build her and use her and
[00:46:52] she's cool but I wouldn't choose her to
[00:46:55] pull for uh albo is is cool he's very
[00:46:58] flexible if you get him but he's not
[00:47:00] like a desired like need him for many
[00:47:02] teams he's good with like Navia and
[00:47:04] other Gio um and and YULA is kind of
[00:47:07] just YULA like she can hit really big
[00:47:09] but she's pretty inconsistent and a lot
[00:47:11] of her best teams just have like she's
[00:47:13] either very copium or she's like
[00:47:17] decently strong but to be decently
[00:47:18] strong you need finina and uh Ryden
[00:47:21] ideally but then it's like okay well for
[00:47:23] duuke you also need finina and Sh Shen
[00:47:24] Yun so
[00:47:28] but deluke a standard
[00:47:29] character so
[00:47:32] yeah
[00:47:44] anyway
[00:47:46] anyways melt plunge speedrun okay
[00:47:51] but dude please don't bring up speedrun
[00:47:54] teams I can't
[00:47:58] anyways we're we're not gonna we're not
[00:47:59] going to get into it the also the only
[00:48:01] reason I don't do okay I like to okay
[00:48:05] okay I need you guys to understand two
[00:48:08] things uh first of all a lot of people
[00:48:10] do different uh their opinions on
[00:48:13] characters vary based
[00:48:15] on what they're going for right I
[00:48:18] personally
[00:48:20] think while optimizing your character to
[00:48:23] their maximum limit is is is is cool and
[00:48:25] a lot of people myself included do that
[00:48:28] usually the way you talk about
[00:48:30] characters and how good they are is like
[00:48:32] how fast no not how fast how much
[00:48:35] investment and like effort and like
[00:48:38] convenience will they need or give you
[00:48:42] to be able to fully clear the content we
[00:48:43] have which is nine star Flor 12 right
[00:48:46] and it's like okay well if you can
[00:48:47] already do that and at that
[00:48:49] point like if you're like turbo 7-year
[00:48:52] investment in the game hyper Bloom is
[00:48:54] not going to be as good as has like a
[00:48:56] lot of Turbo hyper
[00:48:59] carries but is that what I make content
[00:49:02] towards like am I catering towards the
[00:49:04] people that are like at my level of
[00:49:07] investment not as much right like I
[00:49:08] still love you guys but it's like at
[00:49:10] that point do you need a guide to tell
[00:49:12] you yeah you know C6 Chia or not even C6
[00:49:14] like just Chia finina shenyun is going
[00:49:16] to do a lot more than your hyri blon
[00:49:20] team actually [ __ ] it I'll say it Shia's
[00:49:22] broken [ __ ] you that's the only thing
[00:49:24] you need to know all right anyways
[00:49:26] weapons this is what actually matters
[00:49:28] weapons actually matters here I actually
[00:49:30] have
[00:49:38] takes here I actually have takes
[00:49:40] characters I didn't want to talk about
[00:49:42] Miss info no [ __ ] you it's
[00:49:45] not hyp I I always recommend hyper Bloom
[00:49:48] because it's low investment easy
[00:49:49] flexible you have a bunch of elements
[00:49:50] it's actually broken build hyper Bloom
[00:49:52] but and the floor is really high but
[00:49:55] seal ceing wise Shia's ceiling is
[00:49:58] incredible Shia's Shan Yun finina C6 far
[00:50:01] on team is insanely broken I don't care
[00:50:04] I'm not even coping it's actually insane
[00:50:07] I haven't talked about Shia in like 10
[00:50:08] patches cuz he was just kind of all
[00:50:10] right he's good but he's all right but
[00:50:12] now he's actually like but again am i g
[00:50:15] to say that am i g to make a video like
[00:50:17] my video about Shia talks about his like
[00:50:20] how expensive his team is for like 10
[00:50:23] minutes of the 20 minutes why because I
[00:50:26] don't think most people that play the
[00:50:28] game like I think if you just care about
[00:50:31] clearing content and you just want to
[00:50:32] play who you like then it'll be a lot
[00:50:34] easier for you to build a hyper Bloon
[00:50:35] team to clear the content you want than
[00:50:37] to get Shia C6 farzon uh finina shenu
[00:50:41] although you can use Bennett instead of
[00:50:42] one of them so one of the five stars you
[00:50:43] can remove because it's not like that
[00:50:45] much worse it's a little bit worse but
[00:50:46] it's not that much worse but anyways
[00:50:48] right
[00:50:51] anyways I heard it's not good to farm
[00:50:54] flop just for hyper blo
[00:50:56] please be bait please you baiting you
[00:50:58] actually baiting you are baiting me to a
[00:51:00] sunlock you are baiting me to a sunlock
[00:51:01] you are baiting me to a sunlock you are
[00:51:03] baiting me to a sunlock you are baiting
[00:51:05] me to a sunlock react to zad Chow video
[00:51:08] what the [ __ ] did zad show about
[00:51:12] Chow how good is he now bro I just made
[00:51:15] that
[00:51:16] video I'm sure we
[00:51:18] agree hello beautiful
[00:51:22] people overall strength is the very very
[00:51:26] closely tied to barzon now he's on the
[00:51:29] only animal carry right okay but Z this
[00:51:32] is true by the way this is true but Z is
[00:51:33] also cix farzon pilled cuz he lived his
[00:51:35] whole life without CX Faron so he hated
[00:51:37] Shia and then he just pulled CX Faron
[00:51:39] and now he's like I love Shia as well
[00:51:41] however Wanderer doesn't care as much
[00:51:44] about the energy portion of Fon
[00:51:46] constellation 6 right because if you
[00:51:49] don't get Wanderers burst it is what it
[00:51:50] is who cares whereas with Shia you need
[00:51:53] to get your burst B and so the energy
[00:51:55] portion of farizon C6 lets you
[00:51:57] effectively get more damage because you
[00:51:59] don't have to build as much ER because
[00:52:01] of that he's arguably even more reliant
[00:52:03] on ferzon C6 Wanderer is and before the
[00:52:07] last shun Banner ferzon had never been
[00:52:10] on a banner other than W this is the
[00:52:12] best Banner in the game for Shia by the
[00:52:14] way the the shenyun one best by far if
[00:52:16] you're a true like CX farzon I don't
[00:52:18] assume people have it because it's
[00:52:19] really expensive and it's annoying to
[00:52:20] get but if you really like Shia then
[00:52:25] well now it's too late but like my
[00:52:27] recommendation was save for that Banner
[00:52:29] cuz it's insane a banner other than
[00:52:31] imagine you get C6 fars on and shenyun
[00:52:33] from that Banner you already have a team
[00:52:36] that's going to be broken for like super
[00:52:37] long time in my opinion you have sha
[00:52:40] shenyun farzon C6 and then who cares if
[00:52:43] you don't have finina go benett like it
[00:52:45] doesn't matter what the last slot is so
[00:52:47] very quickly for those of you who are
[00:52:49] new the game or just don't know much
[00:52:50] about foration 6 characters affected by
[00:52:54] your old wind buff also gets 40% inre an
[00:52:58] crit damage and when deals damage during
[00:53:02] her ult it will effectively create an
[00:53:04] explosion from her e now the reason that
[00:53:06] matters is because you don't generate
[00:53:08] energy from using your e you generate
[00:53:11] your E from the explosions you generate
[00:53:14] without C6 by doing charge attacks with
[00:53:16] C6 dude this guy's burst is level eight
[00:53:19] what are you dude it's it's it's the C6
[00:53:23] actually cing what that means is that
[00:53:25] the C6 effectively makes you dude the
[00:53:28] Jeff plays the game on copium difficulty
[00:53:30] CR of energy generation whereas only be
[00:53:34] able to get one and you'd need to charge
[00:53:36] attack to get it or you don't need to
[00:53:38] charge attack anymore what this does is
[00:53:41] it overall makes Pon a lot stronger and
[00:53:46] when it comes to Shia if you take into
[00:53:48] account the energy generation the crit
[00:53:50] damage the fact that at C6 she triggers
[00:53:54] the eat damage from her burst multiple
[00:53:56] times so you can run her on tenacity
[00:53:58] that her ER requirements are a lot lower
[00:53:59] so you can afford to run her with a
[00:54:01] little bit of damage the difference
[00:54:02] between having C6 ferzon and even having
[00:54:04] just C5 ferzon in a sh team is massive
[00:54:09] it's very significant and that's his
[00:54:12] [ __ ] team Shia farzon Ka Bennett is
[00:54:16] massive it's very significant and that's
[00:54:20] both a huge downside and a huge upside
[00:54:22] in the sense that it's a huge upside if
[00:54:24] you have it but it's a huge downside
[00:54:26] that you need to have it you don't I
[00:54:28] literally say this in my shot video I
[00:54:30] think C6 farzon is the worst design in
[00:54:31] the game not even close like I don't
[00:54:33] care about some constellations being
[00:54:36] good but like that one being that good
[00:54:38] is [ __ ] stupid whatever it's the
[00:54:40] worst it's actually the worst he's not
[00:54:42] great but he's not bad right he's he's
[00:54:45] the sort of character that his ability
[00:54:47] to consolidate his AOE the the size of
[00:54:49] his of his plung AOE it's it's pretty
[00:54:52] large so it's relatively easy dud I I I
[00:54:55] why can't Z Jeff always be YouTube Z
[00:54:57] Jeff I hate this guy sorry no disrespect
[00:54:59] I love you zff I hate this guy when he's
[00:55:01] not YouTube zff cuz he'll instead of
[00:55:03] saying like YouTube he'll be like okay
[00:55:05] yeah Shia's pretty good uh uh because of
[00:55:07] this but he's also not that good because
[00:55:09] of this right but on stream he'll just
[00:55:10] be like yeah sh was [ __ ] I'm like no
[00:55:13] sorry actually enemies in AOE that's his
[00:55:16] biggest upsite his says tot me is that
[00:55:18] his actual overall damage is all right
[00:55:22] but nothing more than that right he's
[00:55:24] got a way to increase his damage against
[00:55:27] one Target by doing Collision plunges
[00:55:30] effectively getting enemies midair with
[00:55:32] the plunge it makes you do more damage
[00:55:35] but overall he's kind of just all right
[00:55:38] if you actually have C6 ferzon Shon and
[00:55:41] finina he's actually a pretty good car
[00:55:44] right I don't like saying that
[00:55:45] characters are very okay in the Jeff
[00:55:48] okay the okay dreu is telling me this
[00:55:50] that when he watches the zff video he
[00:55:52] has like a notepad of when zff says like
[00:55:55] decent that means they're good once they
[00:55:56] say pretty good for a DPS that means
[00:55:58] broken like that means that means off
[00:56:00] the [ __ ] charts but doesn't want to
[00:56:02] bait you to pull because it's a gotcha
[00:56:03] game which means you're going to be
[00:56:05] baited to spend money which is a bit
[00:56:06] predatory so you shouldn't do that right
[00:56:08] you shouldn't feel forced to spend so
[00:56:10] pretty good
[00:56:13] hey very good but when it comes to
[00:56:16] carries he's definitely one of the
[00:56:17] better ones
[00:56:20] and sorry know this not be reliant on
[00:56:23] Ben Circle anymore is not relying on
[00:56:26] Bennett's Circle not relying on
[00:56:27] Bennett's [ __ ] Circle but I do think
[00:56:30] that I feel like I'm the only Shain by
[00:56:32] the way that doesn't really care about
[00:56:33] that like I get how annoying it is but
[00:56:35] I've never like it's so since 1.0 I've
[00:56:38] been in Bennett Circle that to me it's
[00:56:40] just how I play genin like everyone
[00:56:42] talks about how nice it is and like I
[00:56:44] get it but for me it's just how I play
[00:56:45] like I'm always in bened circle
[00:56:47] characters where he's a nice character
[00:56:50] to get if your account is already strong
[00:56:52] and you already have the pieces to make
[00:56:54] him work and he's a fine character to
[00:56:56] get otherwise but not like great
[00:56:59] personally I got Chia I think it was his
[00:57:01] initial banner and I back then I played
[00:57:04] him in Abyss a decent amount I played
[00:57:06] him less and less in Abyss eventually
[00:57:08] just not playing him in abys why some in
[00:57:09] his chat called I eat baby's 90 for for
[00:57:12] the past few patches before kion's
[00:57:14] release but I still used him in events
[00:57:16] because his can you clear with YY media
[00:57:20] I can't go past 1212 with her all right
[00:57:23] against the sort of that is actually AE
[00:57:26] is good anyways how do c to C SC when
[00:57:30] considering C oh no no a wild scar M oh
[00:57:33] no I'm going to
[00:57:35] hide I think without other surrounding
[00:57:37] pieces they're relatively similar they
[00:57:39] have different strengths right wonder
[00:57:42] will be better at ball content against
[00:57:44] enemies that are mobile and that are
[00:57:46] cringe like we're in serpent Shia will
[00:57:49] be better at AOE and will be obviously a
[00:57:52] lot worse against B enemies that are M
[00:57:55] very mobile when you have genuine and
[00:57:58] finina though do think I'd give it to
[00:58:00] Shia most of the time I still think
[00:58:02] wander would probably be slightly better
[00:58:04] against enemies like Ru serpent against
[00:58:07] enemies like wolf Lord right that just
[00:58:10] stay in the air where your plunge
[00:58:12] attacks can't hit them but yeah you talk
[00:58:14] about his energy I think that's
[00:58:17] a
[00:58:18] true super common mistake people make
[00:58:21] yeah I mean if you look at yeah I mean
[00:58:23] we know this we talked about it for we
[00:58:26] talked about it finina Bennett we talked
[00:58:27] about it yeah is full em sha viable shut
[00:58:31] the [ __ ] up shut the is sh out a meme
[00:58:34] build or actually viable it's somewhere
[00:58:37] between the two it
[00:58:41] is all right
[00:58:47] anyways what's that Vermilion section
[00:58:49] dude we talked I talked about this in my
[00:58:52] video and we also have uh uh math from
[00:58:55] Shain check them out credit to them it's
[00:58:57] in the description I'm pretty sure it's
[00:58:59] not if you're not overcapping Mar onia
[00:59:03] it's his best set especially now with SH
[00:59:05] the problem is it's very easy to over
[00:59:08] cap crit rate with M very very easy see
[00:59:11] so if you're using Jade spear hey
[00:59:13] Vermillion boys we're on
[00:59:15] top gives him like 120 crit rate which
[00:59:19] is why it's weird though cuz it's like I
[00:59:21] want to like be a I want to be like yeah
[00:59:24] I love but I don't want you guys to to
[00:59:26] farm please never enter that domain okay
[00:59:29] just m is good for your account so you
[00:59:30] might as well build it for Shia
[00:59:34] but am using twopiece twopiece part of
[00:59:37] that is because I'm using a crit rate
[00:59:39] weapon I would probably be able to use
[00:59:41] my don't use home on your aasha dude uh
[00:59:45] I aasha
[00:59:46] build sorry I don't want to like
[00:59:49] accidentally leak anything anytime I
[00:59:50] Google something on stream [ __ ]
[00:59:52] Google Chrome is like oh do you like
[00:59:54] here's your [ __ ] postal code I'm like
[00:59:56] okay thanks uh okay we're 21 on H but
[00:59:59] I'm also 21 21 can you do on Jade I
[01:00:02] checked as well I have a jade bill
[01:00:03] that's also like top 20 so we're rank
[01:00:05] one child by the way I don't the Jade wi
[01:00:08] spirit's almost impossible not with jade
[01:00:10] spirit Death Match is really hard not to
[01:00:12] overcap with M say but that brings us to
[01:00:14] one of ch's biggest weaknesses that he
[01:00:16] just doesn't have the best freed topl
[01:00:18] weapons that being said you can still
[01:00:20] just go and it's fine he's like the last
[01:00:24] Last Remnant of blackl Supremacy black
[01:00:27] used to be a very viable option on a lot
[01:00:29] of characters a lot of different weapon
[01:00:31] types with the release of a lot of new
[01:00:35] craftable weapon in inauma then suu and
[01:00:39] then Fen the use cases for blackl over
[01:00:42] craftable weapons went down and down and
[01:00:45] black pole on Shia is probably one of if
[01:00:48] not the the Natan pole arm it's going to
[01:00:51] give you damage bonus because Natan
[01:00:54] pirate they like burn they're like I am
[01:00:56] burning so they take damage they gain
[01:00:58] attack the more damage they take great
[01:01:00] for sha best in slot for free to play uh
[01:01:02] best best fourstar last blackl weapon
[01:01:05] that still doesn't have a better
[01:01:07] alternative what about event weapons I
[01:01:08] mean he's fine on like the the Miss of
[01:01:12] yeah this is better than blacklip uh if
[01:01:14] you're not stacking blacklip usually you
[01:01:16] can't really stack a black Cliff uh but
[01:01:18] it's about is good blackl is nice
[01:01:19] because it gives you crit damage which
[01:01:20] can help balance your ratio out uh and
[01:01:22] with someone like Shan Yun attack
[01:01:24] percent is a bit less valuable but the
[01:01:26] the massive win is still about as good
[01:01:28] slightly better in general missive win
[01:01:30] it's it's an all right weapon but
[01:01:32] especially with SH the crit diamond from
[01:01:34] black is a lot more valuable than the
[01:01:36] attack from this wow we said the same
[01:01:37] thing we should like we should like like
[01:01:40] collab sometime fine weapon how much of
[01:01:43] a difference is finina compared to
[01:01:45] Bennett for Chia uh in this team it's a
[01:01:48] pretty dude don't type gagee it's not
[01:01:51] because shinja synergizes so well with
[01:01:53] finina I mean hey we can but yeah I mean
[01:01:56] that's basically what I said uh but I'm
[01:01:58] glad he's also Shilling Shia because
[01:02:00] when zff says Shia's pretty good that
[01:02:02] means hey to not be if your account is
[01:02:05] already strong and you already have the
[01:02:07] pieces to make him work and he's a fine
[01:02:10] character to get otherwise but not like
[01:02:12] great personally I got Chia I think it
[01:02:15] was his initial banner and back then I
[01:02:17] played him in to actually hit enemies in
[01:02:20] a way to increase his damage against one
[01:02:23] Target by doing Collision plunges
[01:02:25] effectively H and finina he's actually a
[01:02:28] pretty good pretty good ding ding ding I
[01:02:30] don't like saying that characters are
[01:02:32] very good but when it comes to carries
[01:02:35] he's definitely one of the better
[01:02:37] ones when it comes to carries he's
[01:02:39] definitely one of the better ones now
[01:02:40] imagine Shia came out today everyone
[01:02:42] would be like Shia is broken Shia does
[01:02:44] what Shia did what question mark
[01:02:46] question mark 75 reasons you need Shia
[01:02:49] that would happen that would literally
[01:02:51] happen that would literally happen right
[01:02:53] net uh I'll height them everyone's like
[01:02:55] oh oh oh oh oh talk about them me too I
[01:02:57] love Al height
[01:02:58] them I'm just saying I'm just saying I'm
[01:03:01] just saying I'm just
[01:03:04] saying I'm just saying nevet still
[01:03:06] better true yeah and nevet doesn't need
[01:03:08] a C6 far on and nevet doesn't need
[01:03:11] a what's her name shenyun yeah but the
[01:03:16] fact that we're even talking about Shia
[01:03:17] in the same
[01:03:19] conversation that's a [ __ ] win that's
[01:03:22] a [ __ ] win and anyways good
[01:03:26] video uh I will link it although I also
[01:03:29] made a sh video so I should link my own
[01:03:30] video as well but [ __ ] you anyways um um
[01:03:34] what was I doing [ __ ] is wrong with
[01:03:39] me uh oh yeah we were talking about
[01:03:44] weapons okay
[01:03:49] um from back when I talked about I rated
[01:03:53] all the standard Banner
[01:03:55] weapons and this is what I did and I
[01:03:57] mostly still agree uh except in the new
[01:03:59] limited banner I can show you guys it
[01:04:01] let me pull up
[01:04:05] Twitter
[01:04:07] genin gen no shut up don't get a new
[01:04:09] [ __ ] moan compilation denin impact
[01:04:11] Twitter I got
[01:04:13] it
[01:04:15] um Chi-Chi's birthday all right
[01:04:23] cave
[01:04:28] yeah so Jade spear is not here oh song
[01:04:30] of broken Pines is here what the [ __ ]
[01:04:32] wait why did I forget
[01:04:36] that okay I have to [ __ ] think about
[01:04:39] song A I closed everything why does that
[01:04:41] do that who at Windows thought that was
[01:04:43] a good
[01:04:45] idea who the [ __ ] thought that was a
[01:04:47] good
[01:04:49] idea me it you that you don't work at
[01:04:52] windows little bro
[01:05:00] anyways
[01:05:03] um yeah this is still uh don't recommend
[01:05:06] to pull on this Banner out of 10 from me
[01:05:09] however if I were to rank the weapons
[01:05:12] you guys already know my take so uh I
[01:05:15] think Wolf's gravestone is [ __ ]
[01:05:17] really good uh I don't like why are
[01:05:19] there three s's if you're ranking [ __ ]
[01:05:21] that high you're just afraid that people
[01:05:23] are going to look at your tier like oh
[01:05:24] man he ranked the weapon I like low so I
[01:05:26] need to make a higher SSS tier shut up
[01:05:29] have an opinion have an opinion we're
[01:05:31] going to delete
[01:05:32] this um I'm G make this
[01:05:35] red anyways uh there's no Amos yeah the
[01:05:40] I put non-included if there was Jade and
[01:05:41] Amos Jade is like really [ __ ] good uh
[01:05:44] and Amos is like it's no it's only good
[01:05:47] for like one character and even then
[01:05:48] it's not her best in slot anyways um
[01:05:52] wolves is really good the only problem
[01:05:53] with Wolves is that one the passive is a
[01:05:55] little inconsistent two it's attack
[01:05:57] percent which is great but obviously for
[01:05:58] non-attack scaling characters not as
[01:06:00] great but overall it's really good stat
[01:06:02] stick uh the only the main problem is
[01:06:04] that serpent spine exists and it often
[01:06:07] times if you're going to go for a five
[01:06:09] star weapon you might you might be
[01:06:11] spending money and if you are then you
[01:06:12] could get the battle pass however
[01:06:14] obviously you can get a standard Banner
[01:06:16] Weapon by just because it's standard
[01:06:18] Banner whereas battle pass you need to
[01:06:19] pay and if you don't have serpent spine
[01:06:21] wolves gravestone is pretty insane um
[01:06:23] but I think as far as standard Banner
[01:06:25] weapons go WS is really good it's not
[01:06:27] good it is good it's only not good
[01:06:29] compared to limited weapons and uh the
[01:06:32] paid battle pass weapon and you might be
[01:06:34] like okay well a $10 weapon versus a
[01:06:36] five star the $10 weapon is obviously
[01:06:39] like cheaper on average yes absolutely
[01:06:41] but serent spine is just [ __ ] broken
[01:06:43] that's just what it is and this is a
[01:06:45] standard Banner weapon so it's like if
[01:06:46] you're choosing to go for this then I
[01:06:49] don't recommend it at that point I would
[01:06:50] try to get seron spine or a limited five
[01:06:53] star uh uh Claymore like Beacon which
[01:06:55] we're going to talk about right Beacon
[01:06:57] is definitely better but I think as a
[01:06:59] standard weapon wols is really
[01:07:01] good um yeah although I guess the
[01:07:06] context of this is how is it how good
[01:07:09] they are to choose or is it how good
[01:07:11] they are if you get them because you
[01:07:12] might accidentally get one so I think
[01:07:14] that's the better uh way to look at it
[01:07:16] not like what should I choose because if
[01:07:18] you're choosing wolves I I I would say
[01:07:20] don't do that I would say choose this
[01:07:21] one instead but if you get a wolves I
[01:07:23] don't want you to be like [ __ ] this
[01:07:24] weapon's trash it's pretty good um it's
[01:07:28] not like insane but it's it's pretty
[01:07:30] high ranking like let me look at
[01:07:33] B uh oh these teams don't have Bennett
[01:07:36] but like wolves like see look like for
[01:07:38] example Wolf's uh uh this bet rank like
[01:07:41] in this weapon ranking wolves is like
[01:07:43] under servant spine R5 under akumaru but
[01:07:45] still pretty high here it's lower
[01:07:47] because this is an aggravate team um but
[01:07:49] it's still pretty high like it's still a
[01:07:51] good
[01:07:52] weapon um that another Claymore thing
[01:07:54] open
[01:07:56] Navia yeah see like there's weapons that
[01:08:00] are better than wolves but it's still
[01:08:02] decently like a good stat
[01:08:04] stick um and Beacon of the re is insane
[01:08:07] like Beacon is is really [ __ ] good uh
[01:08:09] I actually want to say beacon is just a
[01:08:11] really good stat stick uh let me pull
[01:08:13] out exactly what it does I don't know if
[01:08:15] I'm supposed to be sure is this website
[01:08:16] like cool or are I know you we'll use
[01:08:19] this one for you know
[01:08:22] uh
[01:08:25] sorry
[01:08:26] Suk Beacon of the Reed SE dude this is
[01:08:29] disgusting layout why can't I pull it up
[01:08:32] bro show me the
[01:08:34] [ __ ]
[01:08:36] okay anyways uh it's a lot of crit rate
[01:08:39] dude this is disgusting it's I can't
[01:08:41] even see how much crit
[01:08:43] rate I know it's a lot but [ __ ] it it's
[01:08:47] 33 crit rate uh with a high base attack
[01:08:50] well like a decent base attack right
[01:08:51] like H uh and then you also get attack
[01:08:54] when you skill and then more attack and
[01:08:56] then well HP but you don't really care
[01:08:57] about that
[01:09:00] um yeah so it's it's just a lot well I
[01:09:03] guess HP can be
[01:09:04] good for some characters but um it's a
[01:09:08] lot of attack and it's a lot of crit
[01:09:09] rate which means it's good for like
[01:09:11] every well not every character but like
[01:09:13] most characters and it's a really good
[01:09:14] stat stick and it's often times the best
[01:09:16] Claymore or it's serpent spine like
[01:09:18] usually most Claymore characters that
[01:09:20] unless it's like it's either their
[01:09:21] signature or serpent spine or Beacon as
[01:09:24] their best in Sol so Beacon's really
[01:09:26] [ __ ] good the only problem is no one
[01:09:27] had it cuz it was limited with DEA um
[01:09:30] but it's really
[01:09:32] good wolves is is a is worse but it's
[01:09:35] still a good statistic song of broken
[01:09:38] penis is a weapon of all time it's a
[01:09:41] really high base attack I think the
[01:09:42] highest base attack it's like 741 or
[01:09:44] something insanely High base attack but
[01:09:46] it gives physical um damage bonus where
[01:09:51] is
[01:09:52] it truly a website of all time song of
[01:09:55] broken Pines okay I I need a better
[01:09:58] website song of broken
[01:10:03] Pines Wiki is a little copium but uh
[01:10:06] 741 with 20% physical damage bonus and
[01:10:10] it's like okay obviously it's for
[01:10:11] physical
[01:10:12] carries uh even then sometimes other
[01:10:15] weapons can be a bit better
[01:10:18] situationally Wiki cool Wiki's good I
[01:10:20] just don't like the layout like it's
[01:10:21] hard to like look at it that's all um
[01:10:24] although there might be a picture but
[01:10:26] anyways
[01:10:28] uh the only thing like yeah like FR can
[01:10:31] use it Ula can use it but the the thing
[01:10:33] I also want to point out is similar to
[01:10:35] Aquilla in situations where even if you
[01:10:38] don't care I can unmute alert sorry even
[01:10:40] when you don't care about the physical
[01:10:41] damage bonus it's still okay because it
[01:10:44] has a high base attack and it gives you
[01:10:45] attack percent and something else that I
[01:10:47] forget yeah normal attack speed and
[01:10:49] attack uh as you normal charge attack
[01:10:52] opponents so like assuming you're normal
[01:10:53] attacking if you are it's pretty good
[01:10:56] and if you're not it's worse but it
[01:10:58] gives you attack and a high base attack
[01:10:59] and it's like you would ideally want to
[01:11:01] use the physical damage Bon stat and
[01:11:03] when you are it's a good weapon and when
[01:11:05] you're not it's okay because it's still
[01:11:06] a lot of
[01:11:07] attack but it's not like insane uh also
[01:11:10] yeah this is a Sigil of Whispers so it
[01:11:12] gives it to all party members but in
[01:11:14] order to trigger it you need to normal
[01:11:15] or charge attack but if you do it gives
[01:11:17] your whole team attack percent and Norm
[01:11:19] attack speed which isn't bad so I think
[01:11:22] this weapon is a little underrated
[01:11:24] because the base attack is so high and
[01:11:25] it gives you a decent amount of stats so
[01:11:27] if you get it can be used but I think
[01:11:30] one there's not that many Claymore
[01:11:31] characters
[01:11:32] that are meta and two there's not that
[01:11:35] many that want physical but even if you
[01:11:37] don't like for example here it's like
[01:11:39] it's not great on Navia right like it's
[01:11:41] ranking under [ __ ] or like as good as
[01:11:44] black Cliff like it's not great but it's
[01:11:46] like usable and then for someone that is
[01:11:48] physical like
[01:11:50] um like YULA then obviously it's really
[01:11:52] good I think it's okay I think it's okay
[01:11:55] I don't think it's as good as wolfes on
[01:11:56] average I think it's okay
[01:12:00] um
[01:12:04] yeah meta slave I'm giving advice I
[01:12:07] can't give advice based on how pretty
[01:12:08] the weapon
[01:12:11] is move the webcam what am I
[01:12:15] blocking anyways um Hunter path is
[01:12:18] [ __ ] really good um right it's just a
[01:12:21] stat stick that's really good crit rate
[01:12:23] and then uh like charge attack damage
[01:12:25] based on your em and one other thing
[01:12:29] where is it let me pull it up uh I guess
[01:12:32] I'll I'll just Google it Hunters
[01:12:35] path let me show
[01:12:37] it yeah so [ __ ] 44 crit rate for some
[01:12:40] reason which is 88 crit
[01:12:43] value 44 crit rate that's not okay uh
[01:12:48] low base attack but whatever and then it
[01:12:49] gives you Elemental damage bonus 12% so
[01:12:52] as as a base it's pretty good good and
[01:12:54] then if you're charge attacking it's a
[01:12:55] lot better because it scales on your
[01:12:57] you'll get bonus scaling on your em
[01:12:58] charge attack damage by 160% of your em
[01:13:01] uh it's
[01:13:03] [Music]
[01:13:04] opponent just like for a single Target
[01:13:09] right
[01:13:11] yeah so it's pretty good um as far as
[01:13:15] like Universal
[01:13:17] bows it's up there uh I'm pretty sure
[01:13:21] polar and aqua
[01:13:25] uh I have numbers for this right don't
[01:13:28] I what's a bow character I made a guide
[01:13:30] on
[01:13:32] recently like I'm pretty sure it's
[01:13:34] usually like polar or Aqua or this as
[01:13:37] like a a flexible one
[01:13:41] Linny well Linny doesn't build em but
[01:13:43] it's still going to be crit rate and
[01:13:45] [ __ ] right and it's a low base attack
[01:13:46] but Linny runs like Bennett so the
[01:13:48] attack buff will help a lot I wonder
[01:13:49] where it ranks with lny should have a
[01:13:51] weapon ranking right
[01:13:55] first grade magic Aqua polar harp
[01:13:58] thundering pulse did we not put it
[01:14:02] here wait it's not
[01:14:08] here why is it not
[01:14:11] here I'm the worst guide maker of all
[01:14:14] time my bad I didn't think about it wait
[01:14:18] my bad does kaching Ms have it kaching
[01:14:20] Ms
[01:14:22] Lenny
[01:14:30] weapons because Lenny's teams do not
[01:14:33] trigger significant power reactions L
[01:14:34] will not build meaning his weapons pass
[01:14:35] is close to useless true the provides a
[01:14:37] high C for Mar oh yeah cuz you have crit
[01:14:41] Ascension that's why I remember now I'm
[01:14:43] a good guide maker I just forget why you
[01:14:45] have crit rate Ascension and you're
[01:14:47] going Mar chose so the crit you're
[01:14:49] overcapping but still in general a lot
[01:14:52] of crit rate with is someone like
[01:14:54] outside of that any character that can
[01:14:56] use a lot of crit rate and Elemental
[01:14:57] damage bonus will make the weapon pretty
[01:14:59] good especially if they can use like the
[01:15:00] em and stuff or can buff their Char
[01:15:03] attack damage with the EM that they
[01:15:04] might be building like a melt ganu where
[01:15:06] it's insane
[01:15:08] um wait is there someone else who the
[01:15:10] [ __ ] is a new bet uh a new bow character
[01:15:13] ganu
[01:15:14] [Music]
[01:15:16] Linny Big T I guess panari but he's kind
[01:15:20] of old it's like
[01:15:22] 3.0
[01:15:25] anyways
[01:15:27] um
[01:15:31] aloy
[01:15:39] official f is never going to charge shot
[01:15:41] but it's just a stat stick yeah I mean
[01:15:43] it's just a [ __ ] stat stick uh if
[01:15:45] it's up to me I I would go for Polar
[01:15:47] Star or Aqua as your like Universal
[01:15:50] bow but this is a [ __ ] not standard
[01:15:54] weapon but it's you can lose your 50/50
[01:15:56] and get it or you could get it in like
[01:15:59] if you need a bow and aren't pulling on
[01:16:01] a weapon Manner and because of that I
[01:16:04] think it's really good and I think it's
[01:16:07] worse than Beacon but better than wolfs
[01:16:09] like it's like this almost um I would
[01:16:13] almost put it in the same tier as Beacon
[01:16:15] you're blocking the categories oh that's
[01:16:21] fine I I wonder if I would put it next
[01:16:24] to
[01:16:26] it it's not the effect isn't as
[01:16:29] universal but yeah there's a lot of bow
[01:16:31] characters that are really good and it's
[01:16:33] 44% crit rate
[01:16:40] and I guess I could go like
[01:16:51] here do we have a official
[01:16:54] like yeah I could look this up do we
[01:16:56] have official aggravate weapon
[01:16:58] ranking I don't think zag made
[01:17:01] one and I know I
[01:17:03] didn't
[01:17:11] um he
[01:17:16] did po stars are best thought yeah I
[01:17:18] know I know but
[01:17:19] like I'm wondering how it compares
[01:17:31] hello no it's
[01:17:36] not anyways I know it's within a few
[01:17:39] percents but I wish I had something to
[01:17:40] show
[01:17:42] it
[01:17:47] um what does kqm
[01:17:51] say yeah yeah yeah I mean that's
[01:17:53] basically
[01:17:55] it's B slot but then it's like uh any
[01:17:59] other five star bow stat stick so it's
[01:18:02] yeah I don't really know how
[01:18:04] to yeah I mean I guess it's just next to
[01:18:07] [ __ ] harp right but harp gives you uh
[01:18:11] higher base stack but you don't get the
[01:18:13] elemental damage bonus and instead you
[01:18:14] get like 22 crit rate and 20 crit damage
[01:18:17] whereas this one gives you 40 crit rate
[01:18:20] um so it's like a trade-off I think a
[01:18:23] lot of characters would actually value
[01:18:25] the hunter path
[01:18:28] more because it's like more crit value
[01:18:31] and Elemental damage bonus but the base
[01:18:33] tack is pretty nice I think harp is an
[01:18:35] insane standard weapon though if you're
[01:18:36] going to choose a weapon you choose
[01:18:38] this scy pride is lowkey D tier scy
[01:18:41] pride is like weird cuz no like not many
[01:18:43] characters can use it efficiently but if
[01:18:46] you can make use of the ER it's a pretty
[01:18:47] good stat stick but it's like very rare
[01:18:50] that a character's like a main cuz it's
[01:18:52] not that good for like a support cuz
[01:18:54] there's better options and then for like
[01:18:55] a main DPS there's usually better
[01:18:57] options but if you can make use of the
[01:18:58] ER it's decent on someone like Ula or on
[01:19:01] a dog [ __ ] character where your scalings
[01:19:02] are so bad that the vacuum blades that
[01:19:04] Pride gives you makes it
[01:19:06] good I think it's
[01:19:09] okay um it gives you like 30
[01:19:18] ER but like if you can make use of all
[01:19:20] the stats it is pretty good it's just
[01:19:22] rare that like you want it over other
[01:19:24] options and serpent spine is like
[01:19:26] insanely broken that any other Claymore
[01:19:29] it like doesn't really
[01:19:31] compare
[01:19:34] um except Beacon of the re
[01:19:39] seat but yeah
[01:19:45] um yeah pride is more Universal than
[01:19:47] broken Pines but broken Pines gives you
[01:19:50] like I would say
[01:19:53] no dude I don't even dude I don't like
[01:19:55] broken Pines I'm pretty sure it's even
[01:19:57] close on Ula like it's not like close
[01:19:59] close but it's
[01:20:01] like yeah I guess you're running Ryden
[01:20:04] you don't need as much ER like you do
[01:20:05] like Ryden [ __ ] Charlotte or ma or
[01:20:08] diona or some [ __ ] and then you don't
[01:20:10] really need
[01:20:11] ER but if you do s like Sky pride is
[01:20:14] really close if you need the
[01:20:16] ER on a lot of characters but a lot of
[01:20:20] characters don't need the
[01:20:21] ER
[01:20:27] yeah
[01:20:29] yeah Alice Great Lost prayer
[01:20:32] broken uh we talked about this last time
[01:20:35] I talked about this I used to initially
[01:20:36] I was like oh uh I love Atlas it's
[01:20:39] really good stat stick attack perc on
[01:20:40] everyone High uh base attack and
[01:20:42] Elemental damage bonus I still think
[01:20:44] that exact thing but I I was thinking
[01:20:47] okay lost perers better onfield atas
[01:20:49] would be better off field but even off
[01:20:51] field lost perers as good or sometimes
[01:20:53] slightly better and it gives you crit
[01:20:54] rate which is easier to build your
[01:20:56] characters and like yeah they're pretty
[01:20:58] similar but I think lost prayers like I
[01:21:01] think it's just better because on field
[01:21:02] is better A lot of times like Scara CLE
[01:21:04] whatever and then off field it's similar
[01:21:07] which is
[01:21:08] like yeah uh for example y weapon
[01:21:12] ranking off field look Atlas 108% lost
[01:21:15] rer 108% like they're about as good and
[01:21:17] that's off field and onfield its effect
[01:21:20] is better so it's like yeah I I like
[01:21:23] lost prayers more um and I use Atlas
[01:21:27] like I never had a lost prayer until
[01:21:28] like [ __ ] a month ago um the problem
[01:21:33] with uh catas though is that there's
[01:21:35] super good options like I don't think
[01:21:37] it's a tier above wolves because well
[01:21:40] wolves has okay claymar has serent spine
[01:21:42] but Catalyst has like so many options
[01:21:45] you have witth you have the two battle
[01:21:47] pass weapons that are good you have sack
[01:21:48] frags for a lot of em characters and
[01:21:50] then for support weapons you have fav
[01:21:52] and you have thrilling tals like you
[01:21:53] have so much so I don't think catas are
[01:21:56] as
[01:21:57] valuable well okay catas characters are
[01:21:59] really good so I use a lot of catless
[01:22:01] characters but I don't think having like
[01:22:03] five star catas are as
[01:22:05] valuable as like a jump from the four
[01:22:08] stars or the three
[01:22:10] star uh but I think ler is insane I
[01:22:13] think it's really good um yeah there's
[01:22:15] even there's hakushin ring there's oor
[01:22:17] and ey for characters that can use oor
[01:22:19] eye Shen Yun there there's just a lot of
[01:22:21] good uh IST and I'm a big whith
[01:22:25] enjoyer uh yeah so I think this is true
[01:22:30] for the most part I'm still doing the
[01:22:31] mental math on uh har versus this but I
[01:22:34] think they're relatively in the same
[01:22:37] tier do I think they're necessarily a
[01:22:40] tier above these though maybe not like
[01:22:42] maybe it's like
[01:22:49] this maybe this is true
[01:22:58] B characters are so good though like and
[01:23:02] like there's so wait let me see let me
[01:23:04] see
[01:23:06] bow well yeah I can use
[01:23:09] fav fav wants a five star stat stick
[01:23:12] wants a five star stat well string this
[01:23:14] works but wants a five star stat stick
[01:23:16] veny wants a five star stat stick aloy
[01:23:20] wants a five star stat stick yeah yes
[01:23:23] although she can use rust and slingshot
[01:23:24] so not really and then support support
[01:23:26] support support support although she can
[01:23:29] use the base
[01:23:37] attack and then what about
[01:23:40] catalysts support weapon Lo uh L P is
[01:23:44] great on
[01:23:46] her lost pers is great on her lost pers
[01:23:49] is great on him lost paers is great on
[01:23:51] her lost paers is great on him although
[01:23:52] you can't over cap crit rate with like
[01:23:54] his weapon and stuff but still like any
[01:23:56] five star Callis is pretty good on him L
[01:23:59] is great on him Barbara lost
[01:24:03] P the thrilling tals BYU no
[01:24:10] no you can use the f I mean it works
[01:24:14] but it
[01:24:17] works it's a decent option Nita can also
[01:24:20] use them like she can use it on field
[01:24:22] ESP actually can use off prayer Yi can
[01:24:25] use it really well shenu doesn't really
[01:24:27] want it Mona is Mona so she doesn't
[01:24:29] really want it
[01:24:32] um but that's a lot of characters that
[01:24:34] can use
[01:24:36] it how much of a jump is it from like
[01:24:39] solar this is y off field
[01:24:42] though I don't like looking at y Off
[01:24:45] fieldus 2 no let me look
[01:24:48] at let look at nevet maybe but he's HP
[01:24:51] scaling
[01:24:54] oh let me look at rizzly hey what's up
[01:24:56] guys let's look at rizzly
[01:24:58] cocka yeah five star five star five star
[01:25:01] five star five star five star flowing
[01:25:03] Purity five star five star whith five
[01:25:05] star five catalst that's another thing
[01:25:07] with catalist h i don't know how I
[01:25:08] didn't mention this yet Callis are
[01:25:10] usually like all the five stars are just
[01:25:12] good stat sticks similar and then it's
[01:25:14] like witth and it's like okay whatever
[01:25:15] you
[01:25:16] want so there's like a lot of options uh
[01:25:20] Atlas and lost pair are similar here
[01:25:22] Alice is a bit better running Shena Mika
[01:25:26] kazua here lost prayer is a bit better
[01:25:28] with Bennett yeah of course cuz he gives
[01:25:31] attack I mean they're pretty
[01:25:35] similar yeah I think they're next to
[01:25:37] each
[01:25:38] other I don't know if they're a tier
[01:25:40] higher though I'm not
[01:25:43] sure but Bennett also makes low base
[01:25:46] attack weapons or not attack weapons a
[01:25:48] lot
[01:25:49] better anyways [ __ ] Skyward fine it's
[01:25:51] okay though I mean okay that's not true
[01:25:53] it's it's a second catch it's a second
[01:25:55] catch which makes it better it's
[01:25:57] literally a second catch for Ryden or
[01:25:59] Shang Ling uh it's also has a high base
[01:26:04] attack right what's the base attack of
[01:26:06] it let me
[01:26:09] check should be a high one right yeah 48
[01:26:12] so it's a high base stack if you can use
[01:26:14] the ER it gives you it's pretty good
[01:26:18] um yeah it's essentially a second catch
[01:26:21] for either if you're too lazy to fish or
[01:26:23] if you're using multiple PO on
[01:26:24] characters and a lot of people use po
[01:26:26] characters now I think sometimes for a
[01:26:28] lot of supports it can be a worse Fab
[01:26:30] that's why I didn't level mine I use fa
[01:26:31] on like Shena I use fa on like Rosaria
[01:26:33] or Deathmatch something but Skyward
[01:26:35] spine is a pretty good statistic I think
[01:26:37] as far as Skyward weapons go the ones
[01:26:39] that have high base attack low ER stat
[01:26:41] are better than the ones that have low
[01:26:43] base attack High ER stat that's why I
[01:26:45] prefer Skyward spine to the Skyward
[01:26:47] weapons like even sword although sword
[01:26:49] can be used on Bennett that have high ER
[01:26:51] but lower base attack I think spine is
[01:26:54] pretty good
[01:26:58] um
[01:27:00] yeah I think it's better than
[01:27:02] Pride will this tilt people if I do that
[01:27:05] is this mean I think this is I actually
[01:27:08] think spine is not the same tier as
[01:27:10] those two but I don't think it's the
[01:27:11] same tier as wolves I think like there's
[01:27:13] a gap between the
[01:27:15] two that's C I mean you you can disagree
[01:27:19] I I just I don't think they're the same
[01:27:20] tier Maybe it's given the Claymore
[01:27:23] characters we have right now but like
[01:27:26] also yeah fav is fav but like I can't
[01:27:30] think of more than one character where I
[01:27:33] would choose uh Skyward Pride over
[01:27:35] serpent spine for example and it's like
[01:27:37] the the the character is like fem
[01:27:39] because his base scalings are so low
[01:27:41] that you'd rather have the vacuum blades
[01:27:43] um but scar Pride isn't bad like if I
[01:27:45] show you it the Navia weapon ranking
[01:27:48] where's
[01:27:49] Navia yeah I mean
[01:27:52] that's pretty similar to wolves if you
[01:27:54] need the ER but wolves is also uptime
[01:27:58] dependent and better if you don't need
[01:28:00] ER as well because it it can fit like
[01:28:02] any character that just wants attack but
[01:28:04] I
[01:28:06] mean yeah know this is like it's
[01:28:08] literally worse
[01:28:09] than so many
[01:28:11] options I also think personally there's
[01:28:14] a lot more Claymore uh polearm
[01:28:15] characters that feel happy with Skyward
[01:28:17] Pride than polearm then Claymore
[01:28:19] characters that feel happy what am I
[01:28:21] saying okay okay there's a lot more
[01:28:23] spear characters that feel happy with
[01:28:24] the spear than [ __ ] uh great Axe
[01:28:26] characters that feel happy with these
[01:28:28] two there's too many
[01:28:30] words there's more poon characters on
[01:28:33] average are happier with serpent spine
[01:28:35] than Claymore characters are with these
[01:28:37] two
[01:28:43] weapons one compared to
[01:28:47] others Navia
[01:28:51] huh
[01:28:55] and yeah there's also more good pole
[01:28:57] arms on average like in general that's
[01:28:59] also
[01:29:00] something uh with that in
[01:29:03] mind I think Aquilla and scard pride are
[01:29:06] really good uh I am biased because I
[01:29:09] have always been an Aquilla lover
[01:29:11] because I am the biggest Bennett
[01:29:12] salesman in the world now everyone I
[01:29:15] know that every comment section
[01:29:16] everywhere always has to mention how
[01:29:19] much better Skyward pride is than
[01:29:20] Aquilla listen here Bucko for for for
[01:29:23] most people who are like wow I can't get
[01:29:26] my burst on Bennett yes your 600 base
[01:29:28] attack weapon with 55 ER is great and a
[01:29:31] good
[01:29:32] option but I have to uh uh reemphasize
[01:29:36] that you can't build base attack on your
[01:29:38] weapons on your [ __ ] dude shut up sorry
[01:29:42] sorry I actually delusional today I'm
[01:29:44] sorry you can't build base attack on
[01:29:46] your artifacts and so because of that if
[01:29:49] you if you are high investment and you
[01:29:51] have enough ER then base attack will
[01:29:53] always be more important than ER because
[01:29:55] you can build ER on your um I almost
[01:29:57] said relics artifacts and still have
[01:30:00] high base attack from your weapon which
[01:30:01] you can't get from your
[01:30:03] artifacts and so I think for like most
[01:30:06] people Skyward blade might help you more
[01:30:09] because especially when you're not like
[01:30:11] if you're trying to clear AB 12 and you
[01:30:12] don't have the best artifacts you might
[01:30:14] need more ER and then energy recharge uh
[01:30:17] on your weapon will be very useful and
[01:30:18] this is still a high based stack so I
[01:30:20] think blade is pretty good but but if
[01:30:23] you can if you have enough ER and that's
[01:30:25] the only stat you're looking for for
[01:30:26] Bennett outside of Bennett solo healer
[01:30:28] with finina and then in those teams I
[01:30:31] actually would go scy blade because you
[01:30:32] need so many like you need HP to
[01:30:33] actually heal but I digress uh in like
[01:30:37] if you are like struggling with ER blade
[01:30:39] is going to be better if you have the
[01:30:41] investment needed then Aquilla is going
[01:30:43] to be better it's not the biggest
[01:30:45] difference but it is more base attack
[01:30:47] and at the end of the day it does add up
[01:30:51] I still think most people are going to
[01:30:52] be like okay I just want ER ghost scy
[01:30:53] blade but Aquilla is still better uh if
[01:30:56] you have enough ER so I've always used
[01:30:57] Aquilla the only times I swap off Aila
[01:31:00] as I said is if I'm trying to heal more
[01:31:02] for finina but all I do when I build my
[01:31:04] artifacts is like uh for Bennett I just
[01:31:06] filter by ER and then I pick the highest
[01:31:10] one but yeah you're always going ER
[01:31:14] Sands so the thing is you're either like
[01:31:16] okay I'm on full er do I have enough ER
[01:31:19] if the answer is yes you go Aquilla if
[01:31:21] the answer is no you can use an ER
[01:31:22] weapon that's just what it is
[01:31:25] um
[01:31:29] yeah uh because of
[01:31:33] that I like
[01:31:36] Aquilla oh yeah oh wait also Sky Blade's
[01:31:38] an okay stattic on other characters too
[01:31:40] fa is better for like supporting your
[01:31:42] team but sky is decent stats on a lot of
[01:31:44] Sword characters that actually are good
[01:31:46] supports there's a lot of good sword
[01:31:48] supports there really is like Singo can
[01:31:50] use it uh although you can like there's
[01:31:52] obviously it's not going to be better
[01:31:53] than like a jade cutter but as far as a
[01:31:55] standard five star it's actually a
[01:31:56] pretty decent stat stick if you need the
[01:31:58] ER on a sword character especially if
[01:32:01] it's like a pretty like um I mean
[01:32:05] there's not that many but there's a few
[01:32:07] that can use it Singo is a notable one
[01:32:09] um do I recommend it over like a Jade
[01:32:12] sometimes even fav no but it's pretty
[01:32:15] decent the thing with Aquilla is that
[01:32:17] I'm also the same thing I said about
[01:32:19] song of broken Pines where I I said this
[01:32:22] a few streams ago um okay ignore
[01:32:25] this it's going to perform decently on
[01:32:29] characters that can make use of the base
[01:32:30] attack even if you don't need the
[01:32:31] physical damage now hopefully in the
[01:32:33] future we get a physical sword carry
[01:32:35] that's good what if AR Lino's like [ __ ]
[01:32:37] you [ __ ] my vision well we don't know
[01:32:38] her weapon but what if uh someone comes
[01:32:41] out boom I'm a sword character I'm
[01:32:42] physical [ __ ] you suck my balls uh aola
[01:32:45] would be great because High base attack
[01:32:46] physical damage bonus 20 uh 20% attack I
[01:32:49] don't know I'm sorry for refining this
[01:32:51] 20% attack and an effect that like kills
[01:32:53] you a bit whatever deals a bit of damage
[01:32:55] it's a lot of stats and it's actually a
[01:32:58] decent amount of stats to where even uh
[01:33:00] characters that don't use physical can
[01:33:02] use it as a stat stick is usually
[01:33:04] similar to their like fourstar option
[01:33:06] for example if I use this on AA I get
[01:33:08] made fun of but if you pull up the
[01:33:10] numbers it's about as good as the freeto
[01:33:12] playay option uh I typically would
[01:33:13] recommend Amino because it gives you
[01:33:15] energy makes your build easy but aquill
[01:33:18] is like viable just because of the base
[01:33:20] tag being high and the 20% attack you
[01:33:22] get for free so I am someone who's
[01:33:25] always liked
[01:33:27] Aila um but you usually just St slap it
[01:33:30] on
[01:33:31] Bennett um do I think it's necessarily
[01:33:34] better than the Claymores no but Bennett
[01:33:36] is so broken that I'm going to put these
[01:33:38] two here
[01:33:41] uh dude putting this in C feels wrong
[01:33:44] though it is a limited weapon which
[01:33:47] means if you get it you're not going to
[01:33:48] be as
[01:33:50] mad
[01:34:06] who would I be fine
[01:34:07] using Scout Pride works here Scout Pride
[01:34:11] or Aquilla work here Pride can I mean no
[01:34:14] no not for
[01:34:15] Kirara um kirar wants like a HP or a
[01:34:18] support sword aaka can use Aquilla alth
[01:34:21] am is usually better than both but like
[01:34:23] you can uh fa would be better here IO
[01:34:27] probably wouldn't use
[01:34:29] them more SRO can use skard uh I said
[01:34:32] Pride was it sky sword for sure Fino
[01:34:35] would rather use other
[01:34:38] weapons Alan wouldn't kaching would well
[01:34:41] she could use Aquilla but not for like d
[01:34:44] kaching would rather not Gan could use a
[01:34:49] sword we don't talk about k
[01:34:52] we don't talk about
[01:34:55] albo alette can use
[01:34:58] it yeah I
[01:35:06] mean dude
[01:35:09] I putting Aquila lower than than than
[01:35:12] than than yeah no no no I
[01:35:17] can't dude am I am I weird for not
[01:35:20] liking YULA weapon am I weird I don't
[01:35:22] like it but wolves I don't think wolves
[01:35:24] is that much
[01:35:26] higher I mean maybe it is it's so much
[01:35:28] attack man okay song of broken Pines can
[01:35:31] be better with like Bennett or like
[01:35:33] attack Buffs or a physical carry but
[01:35:35] like wolves is pretty [ __ ]
[01:35:38] cracked as just like a raw stat stick
[01:35:41] but maybe it's not maybe
[01:35:50] it's
[01:35:52] huh how did I do
[01:35:55] that how did I do
[01:36:02] that I need I
[01:36:05] need I need more song of broken Pine's
[01:36:11] math
[01:36:20] okay
[01:36:25] dude I almost want to do that I dude
[01:36:28] dude I I don't know
[01:36:31] dude okay I think by the way if Jade's
[01:36:33] real Jade's here Jade is crack I do that
[01:36:36] dude
[01:36:43] Leila what are the exact stats of
[01:36:46] Skyward Pride let me um let me pull it
[01:36:50] up
[01:36:53] 674 36% ER 8% damage and you have vacuum
[01:36:58] blades High base attack which means it's
[01:37:01] it's going to be a good stat stick if
[01:37:03] you can use the secondary setat that's
[01:37:04] usually how it works are there that
[01:37:06] enough claymar characters that can use
[01:37:08] the ER I think yes I think this weapon's
[01:37:11] actually not
[01:37:13] bad um it just feels bad because there's
[01:37:16] like I would almost always rather use
[01:37:18] serpent spine but that's not what we're
[01:37:20] talking about out so I actually don't
[01:37:23] think it's bad I
[01:37:25] actually
[01:37:28] yeah yeah I actually don't think it's
[01:37:30] bad I just don't know where I rank
[01:37:31] broken penis that's all this is the only
[01:37:33] weapon I'm not sure
[01:37:35] about need to look more into it but kind
[01:37:40] of
[01:37:50] cope
[01:37:58] no I think I'm okay with
[01:38:00] this um wolves is the only thing I'm
[01:38:03] still on the fence about what did I
[01:38:05] think
[01:38:06] earlier yeah I put
[01:38:09] yeah I put these two above both the
[01:38:12] swords I guess they are more versatile
[01:38:14] and this gives a lot of ER and Aquilla
[01:38:15] can't be used on that many characters am
[01:38:17] I just Bennett biased maybe I'm just
[01:38:18] Bennett biased if Bennett didn't exist
[01:38:21] would be here and this would probably
[01:38:22] also be
[01:38:23] here like as far as if Bennett doesn't
[01:38:26] exist I think this is accurate because
[01:38:28] Bennett exists I want to put these
[01:38:30] higher I don't know if that's
[01:38:34] fair C but a with
[01:38:38] Bennett we're honestly s with
[01:38:44] Bennett that's what I think cuz for a
[01:38:46] lot of supports you'd rather use fa than
[01:38:48] this and for a lot of DPSS you'd rather
[01:38:49] use something else than honestly either
[01:38:51] of these but for a physical carry this
[01:38:53] would be broken and for Bennett it's
[01:38:54] really broken and this is also really
[01:38:55] good with Bennett so I think it's
[01:38:57] literally just this is also good with
[01:38:58] Singo this is also good with sing show
[01:39:01] uh but like you
[01:39:04] know dis JY donated $1 can you pull as
[01:39:08] Ed and put the songs you play on screen
[01:39:11] I swear I love all the songs you I used
[01:39:13] to but then I stopped because they don't
[01:39:16] go to the VOD this entire playlist is uh
[01:39:20] it's in chat post the last song we just
[01:39:22] played was called Afterlife by event
[01:39:30] sfold okay I think I'm happy with this I
[01:39:32] think I got to trust my gut more I don't
[01:39:34] know why I'm doubting myself so much
[01:39:35] today why am I being so
[01:39:39] cringe like I haven't used wolves for
[01:39:41] three years I'm starting to think dude
[01:39:43] dude who the [ __ ]
[01:39:46] dude also this isn't on the B but [ __ ]
[01:39:49] you I'm putting it in what are you going
[01:39:50] to do about it get mad at me get mad at
[01:39:52] me get mad at me sorry sorry I still
[01:39:55] think you overrated wolves I think I do
[01:39:57] too like I think I do too but man dude
[01:40:00] it's it's so many stats I like can't
[01:40:03] fathom it being bad like I get like it's
[01:40:07] like I understand I understand and and
[01:40:10] and I understand but it's like let me
[01:40:12] click on a [ __ ] Claymore okay yeah
[01:40:14] Claymore characters are a lot of them
[01:40:15] are kind of poop but it's so many
[01:40:19] stats a attack attack attack and it's
[01:40:23] like yeah you hit diminishing returns
[01:40:24] yeah you might have Bennett you might
[01:40:25] have thrilling tails you might have no
[01:40:27] bless you might have milth like there's
[01:40:29] a lot of things that can make it worse
[01:40:31] but it's
[01:40:34] like if you don't have a bunch of attack
[01:40:37] Buffs it's insane and if you do and if
[01:40:39] you can't proc the passive and if
[01:40:41] there's a lot of like ifs where that
[01:40:43] would make it a lot worse and like yeah
[01:40:45] you can serve it fine yeah Beacon is a
[01:40:46] lot better red horn is like like with
[01:40:48] the Luke for example it'll be like woles
[01:40:50] is great great but if you're running
[01:40:51] Bennett pirate resonance this that this
[01:40:53] that well then you'd rather have a like
[01:40:55] crit stat
[01:41:03] stick yeah I know High base attack with
[01:41:06] low attack per is better than the
[01:41:07] opposite
[01:41:11] but I still can't um I don't think like
[01:41:15] I could see the argument for I'd rather
[01:41:17] have a second catch on my account than a
[01:41:19] wolf's I I I could see that argument
[01:41:22] don3 but I also think as far as standard
[01:41:25] Claymore like standard weapons go it's a
[01:41:27] really good Claymore um cuz I it's
[01:41:30] usually like usually the way I view
[01:41:33] wolves is like better than fourstar
[01:41:35] options but worse than serent
[01:41:37] spine um for like DPS characters like
[01:41:40] it's and and worse than the best it's
[01:41:42] like worse than the best Claymore which
[01:41:44] is Beacon but better than the four stars
[01:41:47] outside of
[01:41:49] serpent
[01:41:52] maybe this is here
[01:42:01] but I don't
[01:42:03] know I like wolves
[01:42:07] um I like
[01:42:14] wolves I mean okay who would I actually
[01:42:16] use it on how many Claymore characters
[01:42:18] are
[01:42:18] usable one
[01:42:22] and a half two and a half three and a
[01:42:26] half
[01:42:31] four
[01:42:35] 4.25
[01:42:44] five bet often times would run teams
[01:42:47] where stacking attack percent isn't as
[01:42:49] important duuke also runs teams like
[01:42:52] that especially with shanu
[01:42:59] now yeah I mean
[01:43:11] maybe okay okay okay okay am I am I a
[01:43:14] fool if I be plus
[01:43:18] this [ __ ] I almost spilled
[01:43:24] yes you're a fool
[01:43:28] okay I think it's just like Claymores
[01:43:31] how like
[01:43:33] yeah okay I am not making a B+ tier I'm
[01:43:36] not [ __ ] dude I'm not doing that I'm not
[01:43:38] doing that I need to have a
[01:43:46] spine I guess okay if it's like how
[01:43:49] useful it'll be for you your account
[01:43:52] then I think on average given the
[01:43:54] characters that people play and the
[01:43:55] weapons you might already have it would
[01:43:56] be a bit lower but it's like quote
[01:43:59] unquote like the value of the weapon if
[01:44:02] you need it I think is higher but does
[01:44:05] that
[01:44:08] matter maybe this is more
[01:44:19] accurate
[01:44:25] all right anyways this doesn't matter I
[01:44:27] mean I'm not making this into a video so
[01:44:28] it doesn't actually matter but just know
[01:44:30] that this is one of the
[01:44:34] two 2our intro don't talk to me this was
[01:44:39] a thought
[01:44:41] exercise still get on Betto yeah I know
[01:44:44] but uh what I mean by that is either one
[01:44:46] you're playing like if you're doing like
[01:44:47] some I guess these are more old school
[01:44:49] teams but you might run with Bennett in
[01:44:50] which case it's is worse and if you're
[01:44:51] running aggravate then it's still worse
[01:44:53] than a lot of the other options um it's
[01:44:56] not worse like it's not like bad but
[01:44:58] it's like it's going to be worse than um
[01:45:01] well yeah it's going to be worse than
[01:45:02] other options but it's still pretty good
[01:45:04] like aquam Maru serpent spine other five
[01:45:07] stars usually math out higher at least
[01:45:11] from yeah
[01:45:16] right but I mean it's still
[01:45:19] good
[01:45:22] [ __ ] man I like wolves I like wolves I
[01:45:25] just like
[01:45:27] it okay well let's move on there's
[01:45:29] literally no reason to talk about this
[01:45:30] anymore it doesn't matter it doesn't
[01:45:31] matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter
[01:45:33] I I I'll do my research I'll come back
[01:45:35] more I'll come back with more Claymore
[01:45:38] knowledge cuz I love the weapon but like
[01:45:40] realistically you're not using that many
[01:45:42] Claymores
[01:45:44] that yeah I don't
[01:45:49] know
[01:45:56] okay okay chat
[01:45:59] let's terrified of the Claymore andies
[01:46:02] no I'm the Claymore Andy cuz okay here's
[01:46:04] the thing I think logically I think not
[01:46:07] that many people like because of like
[01:46:09] other options and not that many Claymore
[01:46:11] characters being like as popular SL
[01:46:13] strong I think wolfes is here but
[01:46:15] personally I believe in Wolf so I would
[01:46:17] put it here like I would put it here but
[01:46:19] like logically I could see it being here
[01:46:21] does that make sense okay I'll shut the
[01:46:23] [ __ ] up I'll shut the [ __ ] up chat let's
[01:46:25] let's let's let's let's change the

[01:50:22] you Coke or
[01:50:25] Pepsi if you choose Pepsi you are
[01:50:27] actually a psychopath okay good orange
[01:50:30] juice or apple juice [ __ ] okay dude the
[01:50:34] only people that care about apple versus
[01:50:36] orange juice are apple juice and droyers
[01:50:38] apple juice Anders are everywhere and
[01:50:39] they don't stop talking about apple
[01:50:40] juice they're like oh do you like apple
[01:50:42] juice and they ask everyone about it and
[01:50:43] then orange juice enjoyers just enjoy it
[01:50:45] like silently and don't talk about it
[01:50:47] cuz it's like expected and no disrespect
[01:50:49] Al apple juice it's fine if you're like
[01:50:51] 8 years old but it's okay it's sweet but
[01:50:54] orange is I'm sorry it's got like the
[01:50:57] sourness yeah of course apples french
[01:51:00] fries or mashed
[01:51:02] potatoes uh okay I'm a fry andyer I
[01:51:06] think Peak mashed potatoes are like
[01:51:08] really good but a lot of times I'll have
[01:51:10] mashed potatoes to be like dry and
[01:51:11] annoying I I'm I'm a more fry guy on
[01:51:15] average chocolate or vanilla
[01:51:18] vanilla
[01:51:21] dude chocolate I'm sorry I know there
[01:51:23] I'm not going to talk about it dude okay
[01:51:25] who sits down and eats plain chocolate
[01:51:27] ice cream I know you be this you could
[01:51:28] say the same for vanilla but it's like
[01:51:31] wait but chocolate is like dude it's
[01:51:32] like overpowering of a flavor and it's
[01:51:35] just
[01:51:36] like like chocolate peanut butter sure
[01:51:38] chocolate banana sure but just chocolate
[01:51:42] like dude what are you
[01:51:45] doing waffles or
[01:51:48] pancakes
[01:51:52] okay this is my take i' I've actually
[01:51:53] thought about this because I I actually
[01:51:55] think about food a lot more than I
[01:51:56] actually eat food waffles okay Peak
[01:51:59] waffles are unmatched but on average my
[01:52:03] pancake experience rates higher that is
[01:52:05] my okay like if I could choose like a
[01:52:08] really good one and I know it's going to
[01:52:10] be good I'll choose waffles but on
[01:52:12] average I have more enjoyment out of
[01:52:13] like normal like average pancakes and
[01:52:15] average
[01:52:17] waffle cuz dude you got like a stack you
[01:52:20] feel like a
[01:52:21] Chad but if I know like a chef's
[01:52:23] preparing it for me I'm choosing
[01:52:26] waffle I think yeah pancakes have a
[01:52:28] higher crit rate and Waffles have really
[01:52:30] high crit damage so like when it hits it
[01:52:33] hits but pancakes hit more
[01:52:35] often cuz I've had more bad waffles than
[01:52:38] I've had bad
[01:52:40] pancakes also French toast is great I'm
[01:52:43] sorry I'm going to say it French toast

[01:55:53] world hunger never ends or end world
[01:55:56] hunger
[01:56:01] what I would rather end I mean what okay
[01:56:05] look look look look
[01:56:08] I ice cream cake or chocolate fudge cake
[01:56:12] uh chocolate fudge I have sensitive
[01:56:13] teeth so ice cream cake in theory is
[01:56:15] really good like I think ice cream cake
[01:56:17] tastes better than chocolate like a
[01:56:18] bunch of chocolate however it hurts my
[01:56:20] teeth and I have sensitive teeth and my
[01:56:22] dentist like yo use sedine it doesn't
[01:56:24] [ __ ] work it doesn't [ __ ] work so
[01:56:26] even when I look at someone biting a
[01:56:27] popsicle it hurt like thinking about it
[01:56:29] just made my teeth hurt so I wouldn't
[01:56:30] want ice cream cake but I think ice
[01:56:31] cream like it could be good but I'm not
[01:56:34] no keep that away from me I'm sorry eat
[01:56:36] at a Michelin star restaurant alone or
[01:56:38] eat with the first person who appears
[01:56:40] when you click share then more all right
[01:56:42] that's first chatter I see Mr Paper
[01:56:45] there you go we're we're eating [ __ ]

[01:57:03] quesadillas or nachos
[01:57:06] nachos not even close both are good
[01:57:09] though give up ranch or give up barbecue
[01:57:14] sauce I think give a barbecue sauce okay
[01:57:17] barbecue sauce is good oh but on ribs m
[01:57:19] wait actually I feel like okay okay
[01:57:21] here's the thing I was thinking Wings
[01:57:23] right with wings you have okay barbecue
[01:57:27] is just worse in hot sauce and then with
[01:57:28] hot sauce you dip it in ranch and then
[01:57:29] that's
[01:57:31] goated but I kind of don't care about
[01:57:33] ranch or anything else and barbecue can
[01:57:35] be used on a lot of things I would
[01:57:37] probably give up Ranch
[01:57:39] then yeah oh never mind never have
[01:57:42] vegetables again or never have fruit
[01:57:44] again [ __ ]

[02:01:07] matter if I can speak every language
[02:01:08] it'd be
[02:01:10] cool photographic memory is also pretty
[02:01:13] busted though I probably choose memory
[02:01:16] oh experience a adventure with pirates
[02:01:18] or explore outer space with astronauts
[02:01:21] hey
[02:01:23] Pirates
[02:01:31] Shia
[02:01:36] okay that was enough of
[02:01:38] that hey we did we finished our
[02:01:46] intro wait what the [ __ ] okay okay
[02:01:50] someone linked this I didn't I I I I
[02:01:53] clicked it I skimm through it it's
[02:01:55] literally zff the entire
[02:01:57] video is my name just there for
[02:01:59] clickbait we are not the same content
[02:02:01] creator we have different
[02:02:02] opinions it's literally just the
[02:02:15] Jeff watch the
[02:02:17] intro
[02:02:21] big reason why whenever I'm doing like a
[02:02:24] frem showcase I just Chuck him in a
[02:02:26] hyper blo team because the other
[02:02:27] characters in that team kind of [ __ ]
[02:02:29] carry while you're on field and cryo has
[02:02:31] Synergy there fridge isn't a worthless
[02:02:32] interaction you actually get more
[02:02:33] balloons for hydro app because the Hydra
[02:02:35] will freeze and then Bloom and then
[02:02:36] you'll get more Dental cores but it is
[02:02:38] what it is you know it's okay I P for
[02:02:39] sword and got harp wait that's actually
[02:02:40] not bad though Harp's actually good harp
[02:02:42] is probably the best five star standard
[02:02:45] weapon you could get think harp is good
[02:02:47] I think is this
[02:02:50] true oh I don't think Z agreed with me
[02:02:53] with that actually Court clickbait [ __ ]
[02:02:55] talking
[02:02:57] people okay
[02:03:11] with
[02:03:16] just having the
[02:03:20] iions things like it's lit
[02:03:24] all I also don't agree with I I think I
[02:03:26] saw this video I didn't I don't know if
[02:03:27] I watched it but I saw it uh yeah I
[02:03:30] don't agree with a lot of the like I'm
[02:03:31] I'm Different weapon wi like I wouldn't
[02:03:33] put a coola over those maybe he has a
[02:03:34] reason for it like it is what it is
[02:03:35] though it's an
[02:03:37] opinion uh I also think wolfes is I'm a
[02:03:41] wolf biased enjoyer scard spine is I
[02:03:43] don't know if those are actually the
[02:03:44] ranking though which weapon this tier is
[02:03:47] going to watch it why not about
[02:03:49] me capable of doing
[02:03:53] by four pieces of Exodia because jino
[02:03:56] driving or I
[02:03:58] guess this guy has sing hater I'm
[02:04:00] starting to get like he's a sing hater
[02:04:02] why do you hate
[02:04:07] sings think he's pretty good she is also
[02:04:10] good in although now that I think about
[02:04:12] it K can be pretty good more sense a
[02:04:15] good a multitude of which are
[02:04:17] viable
[02:04:19] still only in quick you show how much
[02:04:21] result something her team options
[02:04:25] and not about
[02:04:31] me not my
[02:04:34] battle add this
[02:04:41] emote what the [ __ ] is
[02:04:47] run
[02:05:01] cuz I right now there's two worlds
[02:05:03] there's either I watch it and then it's
[02:05:05] going to be a stun lock and a meme for a
[02:05:07] year or I'm just like whatever like you
[02:05:09] know you do you and I don't care I think
[02:05:11] that's the better world than a stun
[02:05:14] lock is what it
[02:05:17] is

[02:08:54] business all right that was
[02:09:00] fast right here right now settle down
[02:09:04] you P for spark on your account at no
[02:09:06] we're going to stream St again this week
[02:09:08] at some point maybe next or in two
[02:09:10] stream no next one is uh the strong
[02:09:17] box damn this is the hardest content no
[02:09:19] this floor 9 although it's not like
[02:09:22] floor 12 is going to seem that much
[02:09:23] harder but it it is harder it is
[02:09:27] harder it is harder we have to do the
[02:09:29] reset is what it is every time I yell
[02:09:32] I'm like echoing in my empty cup cuz
[02:09:35] it's like a ceramic cup so I hear like a
[02:09:40] sound playing y instead official I told
[02:09:42] you I think yay is good stop bringing it
[02:09:44] up I think yay is a great character uh
[02:09:47] she's good she's
[02:09:55] good she's good look I'll avoid I'll
[02:09:58] avoid any stun lock potentials Yi is
[02:10:01] good too hyper Loom is good but it's not
[02:10:03] the only reaction you can run you could
[02:10:04] do other teams uh
[02:10:07] uh the the the last thought it can be
[02:10:09] anything so if you say are like oh but
[02:10:12] cryo does nothing there that's fine play
[02:10:14] another Hydro play play anyone it
[02:10:15] doesn't matter it's a hyper blo team you
[02:10:17] can you can Flex the last slot uh what's
[02:10:18] another sunlock uh uh Shia is is good
[02:10:21] his team is expensive but he's really
[02:10:23] strong if you have it you don't need him
[02:10:25] but he's really broken
[02:10:33] um St loock
[02:10:35] avoided right here emerge is hydro MC
[02:10:38] I'm going to stop you right there I
[02:10:40] don't even need to know the rest of your
[02:10:41] sentence no Hydro MC is not good be
[02:10:46] Sanctified Hydro MC is like your making
[02:10:48] a smoothie but you forgot all the
[02:10:50] ingredients so you just like you put
[02:10:52] like ice and like half of a like
[02:10:56] apple right here I'm always watching
[02:11:00] right now right
[02:11:02] here whoa
[02:11:08] whoa
[02:11:14] applesauce here's
[02:11:17] the St Cloud
[02:11:20] conver useless yeah hopefully pyrro MC
[02:11:23] is good but it might be hard to make a
[02:11:26] goodless I wonder what they would do for
[02:11:28] like cuz so the thing with dendr MC was
[02:11:30] number one there wasn't many and there
[02:11:32] still isn't like that many dendro
[02:11:33] supports and D's D app is like pretty
[02:11:36] good off field and D reactions are
[02:11:37] broken so it it's like a pretty it's
[02:11:40] easy to
[02:11:42] make but like it's not like Hydro MC
[02:11:44] applies Hydro from off field you just
[02:11:46] like shoot a bubble and then swap so
[02:11:51] yeah hopefully Hy I mean pyy does
[02:11:55] something settle
[02:12:00] down two years and still waiting maybe
[02:12:03] healer I thought Hydro was going to be a
[02:12:05] Healer like when I would joke about that
[02:12:06] people be like Suk Suk he he knows
[02:12:09] something we don't Suk I was like dude I
[02:12:11] thought Hydro would be a Healer like it
[02:12:12] would make sense that Hydro heals a bit
[02:12:14] or like grain swords or right something
[02:12:17] nope
[02:12:23] wait we have hydro MC
[02:12:27] exactly oh yeah see well isn't isn't
[02:12:29] that doesn't heal your team
[02:12:32] though does it is it it
[02:12:36] himself Hydro MC
[02:12:39] genin I didn't actually make a guide on
[02:12:41] it
[02:12:45] so let me read the cons uh energy
[02:12:49] movement
[02:12:52] speed HP to the nearest party member
[02:12:54] with the lowest HP percentage based on
[02:12:55] 6% of their Max HP
[02:12:59] wow I guess I was right
[02:13:07] then that is a lot of

[02:22:59] you a
[02:23:02] chance oh
[02:23:04] [ __ ] yo why why are you so yeah dude
[02:23:07] dude dude dude
[02:23:12] dude hi hey can you help me fight the
[02:23:15] Pyro cubes sure we need cryo double cryo
[02:23:18] please for cryo resonance I need the
[02:23:20] crit you won't get the resonance buff I
[02:23:21] will because Hydro plus cryo equal
[02:23:23] freeze but you cannot freeze
[02:23:27] bosses how about AA she applies it so
[02:23:30] fast your AA build is so bad okay she
[02:23:32] only has 43 crit
[02:23:34] rate yo what what is it possible that
[02:23:37] you don't know much about the game if
[02:23:38] this guy says he watches me
[02:23:40] I'm I will end no it's not a good crit
[02:23:44] ratio it's really inconsistent you could
[02:23:46] get way more damage 75 and 150 in a free
[02:23:49] seam she gets 15% from resonance and 40
[02:23:51] from blizzard stayer true approx two
[02:23:54] crit damage no but it's still not 100
[02:23:57] what 40 + 15 plus how much was it 43
[02:24:01] that is that is a lot 40 plus 40 80 plus
[02:24:04] 15 that's over
[02:24:08] 100 wait what 97 yo no one can
[02:24:12] math I can't math it's 998 why' they say
[02:24:15] 97 it's 98 3 plus 5 is8 am I stupid okay
[02:24:20] I know I'm sleep deprived but this is 98
[02:24:23] they both said 97 they both I know I
[02:24:26] said over a 100 at first cuz I'm [ __ ]
[02:24:28] stupid okay I maybe maybe I was think of
[02:24:29] the 5% base that AA starts with I'm
[02:24:32] stupid but that's a given you know I'm
[02:24:33] stupid I'm honest about it I'm not lying
[02:24:36] to you I'm not lying I'm
[02:24:39] stupid anyways yeah
[02:24:42] 97 you would need 100% for maximum
[02:24:44] consistency even if you get slightly
[02:24:46] dude what are these guys yapping
[02:24:50] about mate I have a oh o bra o listen
[02:24:54] bra sorry mate I have a bachelor in
[02:24:56] physics I know how math works well your
[02:24:58] build is still bad you need to use that
[02:25:01] knowledge for genit okay got of roasted
[02:25:03] I mean your your build is good but that
[02:25:05] line kind of roasted you I can't lie uh
[02:25:07] but you don't for some reason do you
[02:25:09] just come here to embarrass yourself
[02:25:10] about you need to freeze the Pyro Cube
[02:25:13] you forgot to freeze it you triggered
[02:25:14] melt first bringing cry on this boss
[02:25:17] isn't good because you can neither
[02:25:18] affect it freeze reduces
[02:25:24] cry what is Yap what are these guys
[02:25:27] yapping about just like kazwa didn't you
[02:25:30] know Source genin Wiki no you don't
[02:25:33] understand why then ex how many pictures
[02:25:36] are in this dude I thought it was like
[02:25:38] two then explain Chong Yun and aaka can
[02:25:41] I full screen this oh I can Chong Yun
[02:25:43] and aaka have enough cryo enough cryo
[02:25:46] for what because Chong needs to include
[02:25:47] aa's normal attacks and aa's charge
[02:25:50] attacks oo thinking her charge attacks
[02:25:53] hit Thrice that's how it works so three
[02:25:57] times the cryo
[02:25:58] app this guy's on to something let him
[02:26:00] cook but you left Chong in Fusion range
[02:26:03] do you know what ICD is no it works
[02:26:05] every hit wait imagine this guy wrote
[02:26:08] icd's nuts and then
[02:26:11] left do you know that AA can Infuse
[02:26:14] herself let me show you on enemies see
[02:26:16] it's cry now I think yes but it's only a
[02:26:18] bit infusion like duuke oh yeah like
[02:26:21] duuke no it's like duuke kind of the
[02:26:23] burst has a cry infusion thingy but with
[02:26:25] trong Yun it's more y notoriously aa's
[02:26:28] burst infuses your attacks with cryo
[02:26:30] that's true notoriously uh yep no why
[02:26:33] rizzly applies cryo on every hit and
[02:26:35] he's not the
[02:26:38] strongest I'm pretty sure rizzly has
[02:26:41] ICD um but I could be wrong Nita is
[02:26:46] stronger he's a cryo
[02:26:49] Catalyst that's why I try so like years
[02:26:53] ago I would say uh when I'm talking
[02:26:55] about Catalyst characters now I try to
[02:26:56] say all their attacks do cryo damage cuz
[02:26:59] like technically each attack can apply
[02:27:02] cryo but it won't because there's ICD so
[02:27:04] it's like it's hard to like say that
[02:27:06] sentence without people like
[02:27:08] misunderstanding it uh but yes each
[02:27:11] attack like is cryo does cryo damage can
[02:27:16] cryo but there's
[02:27:18] ICD n is strong he's a crow Catal he's a
[02:27:21] crow Catalyst he deals Crow damage on
[02:27:23] every hit but that is not the same C
[02:27:27] cryo see oh [ __ ] you just got got Chong
[02:27:32] you wait I have a more fitting song for
[02:27:45] this
[02:29:42] anyways that was
[02:29:45] funny

[03:00:57] actually changed from uh Japanese to
[03:00:59] English after y's release because if I
[03:01:02] say right here right now emerge but
[03:01:05] there's no English voice on and you
[03:01:06] can't hear it I sound like a crazy
[03:01:08] person I sound like a psychopath okay I
[03:01:11] still have voice lines from when I used
[03:01:13] to play Stone
[03:01:14] listen I've got the beast in my sight
[03:01:18] but none of you get that unless you
[03:01:19] played it and I I I repress those every
[03:01:22] time I see a reference I want to say it
[03:01:24] but I don't and I don't because you
[03:01:26] don't get the reference so if I don't
[03:01:27] play in English you'll think I'm just
[03:01:29] saying random [ __ ] you'll think I'm
[03:01:31] saying random [ __ ] do Grim Patron
[03:01:34] everyone get in here

[03:01:46] I need some for the slice strongbox
[03:01:47] video 2.6 million is my guess how do I
[03:01:49] check again I I need to go like uh like

[03:01:58] God G PR yeah Z buy skins on characters

[03:02:12] amount of money is
[03:02:14] Ern dude dude dude dude I
[03:02:20] carried

[03:03:47] nevet was floating like I I saw like I
[03:03:49] saw that his charge tack was like a
[03:03:51] giant [ __ ] but I didn't know that he

[03:08:59] you Chad if I come I
[03:09:01] Temple I didn't say
[03:09:03] that
[03:09:04] [Music]
[03:09:09] this sages think themselves to be hon un
[03:09:13] knowing but we alone are wise to The
[03:09:17] Virtue in those acts of
[03:09:20] folly in this war not even a single Pawn
[03:09:24] may be
[03:09:26] spared because on this chest board okay
[03:09:30] uh I have a theory he said not even a
[03:09:31] pawn can be spared but Senora died
[03:09:33] Senora obviously is more than just a
[03:09:35] pawn uh which means because she can't be
[03:09:38] spared this means she's gonna resurrect
[03:09:39] it was all planned she's a phoenix she's
[03:09:41] gonna resurrect she's gonna it's a
[03:09:44] foreshadowing I Told You So when it
[03:09:46] happens you'll be like whoa how did he
[03:09:48] know
[03:09:50] spared just because on this
[03:09:53] chessboard Checkmate is not where the
[03:09:57] game

[03:10:25] passing they predicted that the Queen
[03:10:28] Elizabeth the sorry for half a day as
[03:10:31] the nation Mourns her
[03:10:34] passing merely half a day people say the
[03:10:37] northern bank's true currencies are
[03:10:39] Blood and Tears but may are even
[03:10:42] speaking as a banker that sounds a
[03:10:44] little
[03:10:46] unconscionable Rosaline died in a
[03:10:48] foreign
[03:10:49] land but you heartless businessmen and

[03:10:54] excuse to remain in the comfort of your

[03:40:06] where live stream bro they they
[03:40:10] they showed what it looked

[03:40:25] was a lot of
[03:40:27] Defense okay look I I guarantee you this
[03:40:31] opinion is going to be valid when it
[03:40:32] comes out uh I don't know what the [ __ ]
[03:40:35] the effect is but in general if it is a
[03:40:37] defense Main St then why would you pull
[03:40:39] for a defense sword on your account like
[03:40:40] two characters can use it just use like
[03:40:43] [ __ ] I mean we'll see what's good but
[03:40:44] if if it is defense then just go cabar
[03:40:46] or like Harbinger but we'll
[03:40:54] see like unless you want to end up like
[03:40:58] me unless you want to end up like
[03:41:01] me and have uh this [ __ ]
[03:41:05] [ __ ] but yeah we don't know maybe the
[03:41:07] effect is defense and it gives crit I

[03:42:34] currency that like through events you
[03:42:37] might get an event currency and then you
[03:42:38] could buy an old one so then it

[03:48:55] puts the middle before like big and
[03:48:58] small it's like if gold delocks started
[03:49:01] with the perfect stew porridge before
[03:49:04] the hot like the hot and the cold one it
[03:49:06] wouldn't make sense grammatically or

[03:56:42] something good pausing the champ pause
[03:56:46] champ that is
[03:56:49] terrible that could be good that
[03:56:52] actually could be good okay fine
[03:56:54] whatever fine fine fine fine fine what
[03:56:59] is it
[03:57:01] 831 wait what do you ask for like
[03:57:07] teams
[03:57:09] okay you have two
[03:57:11] minutes
[03:57:20] uh
[03:57:21] okay
[03:57:33] um are you saying you can't ninar these
[03:57:35] characters should definitely be able to
[03:57:37] ninar if they can just put your right in
[03:57:40] On Em sorry
[03:57:43] um your H definitely needs crit rate uh
[03:57:47] that is what I'm going to say your Hut
[03:57:48] definitely needs crit rate
[03:57:51] uh I wouldn't even use H at that point
[03:57:53] but ideally I would I mean I would use
[03:57:55] hom but I would get pieces with crit
[03:57:57] rate so your flower amazing your feather
[03:57:59] is good but very low crit rate so you
[03:58:02] know uh oh yeah you also have no
[03:58:05] em dude your s sucks it is it is it
[03:58:09] happens uh also I'm going to say this I
[03:58:12] don't care how unlucky you are with
[03:58:14] artifacts offset ciret is absolutely
[03:58:17] griefing you there's no reason to ever
[03:58:19] do this if you have a good power golet
[03:58:21] here's why Hut your Hut in particular
[03:58:24] has dog [ __ ] crit rate what is the only
[03:58:27] piece that can't give you more crit rate
[03:58:29] than the main stat it's the one with the
[03:58:30] main stat so crit rate ciret even with
[03:58:33] no substats yeah it would be worse than
[03:58:35] 28 [ __ ] crit damage but until you
[03:58:37] have enough crit rate you need more crit
[03:58:39] rate so what you would do is take one of
[03:58:40] the pieces that has no crit rate like
[03:58:42] there there's five there there's five
[03:58:44] there there's zero and then use that as
[03:58:46] your offset piece and then your circl
[03:58:47] would be onset this is a really good
[03:58:49] circlet but I would use it on someone
[03:58:50] else until you solve your crit rate
[03:58:53] problem uh you also need em ideally use
[03:58:56] an em sand maybe you have an offset em
[03:58:57] sand with crit
[03:58:59] rate that has 25 defense anyways you get
[03:59:03] my point that's what I would do um or
[03:59:06] you could get em substats you want at
[03:59:07] least 100 uh more important than
[03:59:10] crit
[03:59:12] um that's a lot of crit rate but it's
[03:59:15] it's fine uh it might be too much
[03:59:18] depending on your team but I think it's
[03:59:21] fine because you're probably not cryo
[03:59:23] residenc thing if you're
[03:59:27] melting but it's good um your R is fine
[03:59:32] your IA is also fine the ER is either
[03:59:34] fine or not enough depending on your
[03:59:36] team I don't know what you're running
[03:59:37] you might want to a bit more you might
[03:59:39] be fine uh attack could be higher but it
[03:59:42] is what it is you're running a crit rate
[03:59:43] ciret which uh it's a little I mean it's
[03:59:47] fine it's a little Overkill CU you get
[03:59:49] 40 from
[03:59:51] blizzard and 15 from Crow
[03:59:55] residence I would you could honestly
[03:59:58] even consider an attack circlet if you
[04:00:00] have good subsets on it but this is fine
[04:00:02] your C your your goblet kind of sucks
[04:00:05] cuz the Em's
[04:00:06] wasted but like I I don't have a problem
[04:00:09] with I think your do just needs crit
[04:00:10] rate this is this also needs crit rate
[04:00:13] like why you on a crit damage circle
[04:00:15] with
[04:00:26] witth yeah imagine you took this circlet
[04:00:29] you give this one to Scara because it's
[04:00:31] offset anyways boom you're you're you're
[04:00:34] [ __ ] I
[04:00:36] mean yeah you're [ __ ] cracked out the
[04:00:38] wazu and then your Hut goes onset and
[04:00:40] then offset uh something else with cr r
[04:00:43] and
[04:00:46] Y yeah I mean this is
[04:00:48] fine a bit heavy on the crit rate with
[04:00:50] catches passive though
[04:00:55] um yita is also fine your sand is
[04:00:58] terrible uh and your goblet is terrible
[04:01:00] and your ciret is terrible but it's okay
[04:01:05] because low investment Nita is still
[04:01:07] pretty good however this is 79 flat
[04:01:09] defense 63 flat defense 25 defense per.
[04:01:12] uh it is what it is do understand though
[04:01:16] also your Safa is low level do
[04:01:18] understand that when I say Nita can go
[04:01:21] em or crit or dender damage bonus I mean
[04:01:24] it which means you don't need to go em
[04:01:26] if your sub stats suck danger damage and
[04:01:28] crit are pretty
[04:01:29] similar you don't just need
[04:01:36] em plus zero
[04:01:39] that pretty good yo damn elect

[04:08:55] implied
[04:08:58] boom oh this Doan sucks I mean this
[04:09:02] could be
[04:09:06] good
[04:09:09] genin impact players what comes up day
[04:09:13] in the life of a genin player
[04:09:15] classifying genin players genin
[04:09:21] impact I tried genin
[04:09:36] impact
[04:09:39] someone like
[04:09:41] you I wish but
[04:09:45] the for
[04:09:49] you
[04:09:51] me
[04:09:53] sorry I'm
[04:09:59] sorry sometimes silence is the
[04:10:02] answer I'm
[04:10:06] sorry
[04:10:17] I swear I'll remember you say
[04:10:23] [Music]
[04:10:28] sometimes
[04:10:36] sorry
[04:10:53] dude my YouTube recommended is so [ __ ]
[04:10:54] right now not even recommended like I
[04:10:56] searched gench and impact players and I
[04:10:59] I like scrolled so far that like what
[04:11:02] what is happening
[04:11:05] confirmed confirmed
[04:11:08] new
[04:11:10] codes solo
[04:11:13] aaka true actually the weapon better
[04:11:15] pity was
[04:11:17] good the
[04:11:24] truth let's
[04:11:36] get
[04:11:38] goofy music sorry I got
[04:11:42] you was was
[04:11:44] better 111 okay standing
[04:11:48] [Music]
[04:11:49] around Lea X from an
[04:11:57] [Music]
[04:12:00] A like I knew you could but I know like
[04:12:03] the cool down
[04:12:04] would never prob deserve
[04:12:07] she was for free
[04:12:12] hand
[04:12:14] out dude dude what's wrong with the gon
[04:12:18] YouTube
[04:12:22] page those memories so
[04:12:30] dark uh catch is amazing because one
[04:12:33] it's free to play two it gives you
[04:12:34] energy recharge and crit rate which
[04:12:35] makes your build very easy to build and
[04:12:38] it's uh for example if like a a purely
[04:12:41] DPS weapon is rated higher a lot of
[04:12:43] times you might need the ER as well so
[04:12:45] it
[04:12:46] depends uh I might make an updated
[04:12:48] shanglin guide soon though cuz a lot of
[04:12:50] stuff changed you know like team comp
[04:12:52] wise um Death Match is really good on
[04:12:55] her though because Bennett gives a lot
[04:12:57] of attack so you get uh crit rate from
[04:12:59] it um even though the base attack is low
[04:13:02] but it depends based on your team right
[04:13:03] like damned will sooner die again than
[04:13:06] lay a hand on me
[04:13:09] okay
[04:13:11] POG 10 ways to dodge and genin I should
[04:13:14] probably watch
[04:13:16] that
[04:13:27] anyways I feel like that music is what
[04:13:29] plays in your mind no it
[04:13:32] doesn't you know what does play in my
[04:13:36] mind

[04:55:12] rectangle
[04:55:17] rectangle be used for a general idea and
[04:55:20] not an exact ranking of each weapon
[04:55:22] because it varies heavily based on your
[04:55:23] teams rotations and artifacts what
[04:55:26] supports you run can affect the weapon
[04:55:27] ranking especially if you're not running
[04:55:28] a support like Bennett who gives you a
[04:55:30] lot of attack making attack percent
[04:55:32] Claymores or high base attack Claymores
[04:55:34] all the more oh yeah that's another
[04:55:36] thing this is with Bennett which is why
[04:55:37] wols is so low dude imagine no okay if
