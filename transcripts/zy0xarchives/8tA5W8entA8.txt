[00:07:17] like picking who to pull it doesn't I
[00:07:20] can't DM this I have to like it's
[00:07:21] impossible to DM people so I did it for
[00:07:24] two people but it's so hard so I'm just
[00:07:25] gonna take you all that in chat sorry if
[00:07:27] you got scammed but uh I mean it is what
[00:07:29] it is I don't know dude it's it's so

[00:14:21] other characters look
[00:14:22] look at this [ __ ] [ __ ] it's literally
[00:14:26] a [ __ ] wait no you have to burst

[00:14:45] wait I [ __ ] up there's nothing
[00:14:47] look you can press hold and then you

[00:15:21] it's like 10 damage or something like or
[00:15:24] something like that but then also it
[00:15:25] like it fixes your skill issue so like
[00:15:27] if you suck
[00:15:29] then you might need it but if you're

[00:20:57] hey how you doing
[00:21:00] I am great how are you I was talking to
[00:21:02] my
[00:21:04] that was my intro
[00:21:08] of course and against chat
[00:21:11] I don't pre-record things
[00:21:14] what do you mean you don't have we're
[00:21:15] doing viewer pulls
[00:21:18] it's Jake tawano
[00:21:19] and the loser
[00:21:21] has some very bad things to do I don't
[00:21:24] know what yet I was like yeah your tweet
[00:21:25] I saw a reply that was like it was like
[00:21:27] dude it was so rigged it was like great
[00:21:30] ones there was one that was like the
[00:21:31] most liked one was good but it was
[00:21:33] rigged it was like if if Jake wins Nick
[00:21:36] cosplay's Gene and then it's like okay
[00:21:37] damn that sucks and then it's like if if
[00:21:40] Nick wins Jay cosplays Xiao but like you
[00:21:42] would cross the Xiao anyways that's not
[00:21:44] even as big of a punishment
[00:21:46] actually
[00:21:52] that's not bad combination good
[00:21:55] combination
[00:21:56] wait
[00:21:57] so if if I win
[00:22:01] wait what
[00:22:02] wait so I mean it's up to you I don't
[00:22:04] know but like that was the only reply I
[00:22:06] saw I don't know what we're doing but
[00:22:07] boy this is this is this is the most
[00:22:09] like that's true it has lament reply
[00:22:11] under it so that's how you know it's
[00:22:13] good
[00:22:14] okay so if I win you cosplay Gene
[00:22:18] and if you win I cosplay kokom
[00:22:22] yeah but okay but here's the thing my
[00:22:26] artifact lock is really bad so my gotcha
[00:22:28] luck has to be good because they're
[00:22:29] always reversely proportional
[00:22:32] you want to test that inversely yeah
[00:22:34] yeah that's how it works it's like the
[00:22:35] people that are super lucky on polls
[00:22:36] have [ __ ] artifacts and people that have
[00:22:38] good artifacts are unlocking on pulls
[00:22:40] it's one or the other
[00:22:43] true Spirit okay yeah sure you know yeah
[00:22:46] no no tell me your experience
[00:22:48] we will we okay so from my experience
[00:22:51] none of that matters

[00:22:57] nothing matters
[00:22:59] because if it doesn't work I just put
[00:23:01] more money and then eventually it might
[00:23:04] work
[00:23:05] that is that is true but then but then
[00:23:08] sometimes it doesn't so you just keep

[00:26:22] things I'm not doing nothing
[00:26:25] check Discord okay
[00:26:27] all I'm seeing is hot sauce and alcohol
[00:26:33] um you could also just pick a Twitter
[00:26:34] picture for you for like a week if you
[00:26:36] get GiGi
[00:26:38] you're what
[00:26:41] I already have two I'm saying uh we
[00:26:43] could we could also just change our
[00:26:45] profile picture to something for like a
[00:26:46] week on Twitter
[00:26:52] okay

[00:27:03] the possibilities of my profile picture
[00:27:05] that could be anything on the internet
[00:27:06] for a week is pretty dangerous it is I
[00:27:09] could also get you one of the like booba
[00:27:10] mouse pads and then you have to use it

[01:23:54] burst you put water shifts on the ground
[01:23:55] you charge track next to the Limit
[01:23:56] charge accidentally that's it that's
[01:23:58] basically it he's just a Hydra on field
[01:24:00] he's really good though
[01:24:03] and the caulk is massive so you can
[01:24:05] shoot from Far very far away
[01:24:12] it is like this isn't even wrong like
[01:24:14] it's actually huge
[01:24:17] house damage so his damage doesn't
[01:24:19] matter because he's a hydron Fielder so

[01:24:32] the main part of this kid anyways like
[01:24:33] his damage is really good but like even
[01:24:35] if his damage wasn't that good
[01:24:38] hydron field is already good if you
[01:24:39] apply enough Hydro but his hot drops not
[01:24:41] the highest but

[02:30:26] um Mr best one
[02:30:33] attack percent is useless here I wish we
[02:30:35] had a Dicker damage one but we're using
[02:30:37] a crittery weapon Hydro Goblin good
[02:30:39] thing we have a great offset one that no
[02:30:41] one is using it's usually not even on

[02:31:01] prototype Amber as well it's free to
[02:31:03] play Don't Pepe W me we have a little
[02:31:05] bit too little crit rate though so we

[02:33:51] me
[02:33:51] like I'm not worse in French and I'm in
[02:33:53] English so it's all the same
[02:34:04] time
[02:34:10] I'm a bit worse than French now because
[02:34:13] I like only speak English as long as
[02:34:14] I'll talk to like my French friends
[02:34:16] uh and it's like I like lost my touch
[02:34:18] but it's fine
[02:34:31] wait we have three HP

[02:35:32] it's insane I think it's really good and
[02:35:34] really fun I think he's actually super
[02:35:35] sick
[02:35:41] you wanna call I just got off call with
[02:35:43] Jake I'm like I need to level him now
[02:35:45] I'm down later though but there's a good
[02:35:47] chance that it takes me six years to
[02:35:48] gear him because I have no mats but I'm
[02:35:50] not after none later
[02:35:53] but dude like I'm down to talk about him
[02:35:54] but like I need to [ __ ] level him
[02:35:56] first dude it's gonna take fine
[02:35:59] his rotation is so short no it's not
[02:36:03] oh actually Zach if you're here do you
[02:36:05] agree that a standard a typical nebula
[02:36:07] rotation is like two skills which is 24
[02:36:09] to 25 seconds but you swap in and out of
[02:36:11] them to extend Buffs like you'll do like
[02:36:13] burst or E first whatever you apply
[02:36:14] Hydra you swap you like swirl it
[02:36:16] official zhangly whatever then you go
[02:36:17] back you do like two charge attacks and
[02:36:19] your other [ __ ] then you can swap back
[02:36:21] out to reapply re-summon and then you go
[02:36:22] back agree or no you're not here anymore
[02:36:24] all good
[02:36:26] I feel like that's how you play them
[02:36:34] in order to answer your idea to make you
[02:36:35] a 7tp editor dude no
[02:36:39] no link me the
[02:36:41] easiest do

[02:50:55] aware
[02:51:09] I mean to be fair physical it has the
[02:51:11] hyperbloom in this game

[02:51:27] yes
[02:51:39] all right
[02:51:43] physical is a whale type in Hawkeye back
[02:51:45] third dude I saw what's happening with
[02:51:46] Hawkeye third right now I saw the
[02:51:48] Hawkeye players in my timeline
[02:51:49] despairing because there's like
[02:51:51] apparently there's like new chapter new
[02:51:52] stuff I don't know
[02:51:55] I heard I saw everyone despairing
[02:51:59] you guys okay you guys okay over there
[02:52:01] no party's gonna have a self-insert oh
[02:52:03] you I mean I don't know
[02:52:05] no comments because I don't play that
[02:52:07] like I haven't played that game that
[02:52:08] much but
[02:52:11] I'm not a big fan of self-inserting in
[02:52:13] general because I'm not like
[02:52:17] is talking to me like I don't except
[02:52:20] Chow Xiao is talking to me and if you
[02:52:22] say otherwise [ __ ] you
[02:52:41] um where am I going
[02:52:49] yo there's a thing in your world
[02:52:52] why can't you steal the moro from them
[02:52:54] let me steal it give me it
[02:52:57] dude can you imagine if they did oh oh
[02:53:00] my God could you imagine if they did a
[02:53:02] co-op imagine if they wanted you to
[02:53:04] explore Co-op right and they make it to
[02:53:06] where when you guys when you explore a
[02:53:08] world with someone else it like would
[02:53:11] sink your chest where if you loot a chat
[02:53:13] like it's their world right but if you
[02:53:14] pick up a chest that you didn't open in
[02:53:16] your world it opens it in your world too
[02:53:17] and then you get the rewards and then
[02:53:19] and then and then there's actually a
[02:53:20] reason to have friends and then you can
[02:53:22] actually play with your friends without
[02:53:23] feeling like you're gonna have to
[02:53:24] re-explore it all after
[02:53:29] get me on the dev team
[02:53:33] I'm gonna mask my intentions and then
[02:53:35] when they're not looking I'm gonna buff

[02:53:45] make I'm gonna make
[02:53:47] I'm gonna make her energy generation
[02:53:49] like slightly slower like super slightly
[02:53:52] less to see if anyone can tell
[02:54:11] make shangling bad why do you guys not

[02:59:27] look at the size of that dude it's
[02:59:29] [ __ ] massive
[02:59:32] it's large
[02:59:36] sorry
[02:59:51] I actually just like hearing his death
[02:59:53] Voice sign because I think it sounds
[02:59:54] pretty funny so that's why I just want
[02:59:56] to show you guys because like I don't
[02:59:58] want you guys my viewers are so high
[03:00:00] level that you guys aren't gonna die so
[03:00:02] you would never hear that voice line and
[03:00:03] frankly never would I too I would never
[03:00:05] hear because I'd never die and because
[03:00:07] of that I wanted to show you guys the
[03:00:10] voice acting that they did for that
[03:00:13] underused line in our community
[03:00:19] [Music]
[03:00:20] oh yeah all right
[03:00:34] thank you you're welcome
[03:00:38] dude I actually can't kill it I have no
[03:00:41] energy
[03:00:48] canivia Drive taser hyperloop yes those
[03:00:49] are his best teams
[03:00:51] taser and hyper blue are the best teams
[03:00:56] you don't need to use Beto on him in
[03:00:58] fact uh sometimes you would want to use
[03:00:59] like Causeway wrongly official but Beto
[03:01:02] does work well with him because Beto
[03:01:04] works on charge attacks Beto doesn't
[03:01:06] only work on normals right like who
[03:01:09] don't really work with him uh Beto does
[03:01:22] work I don't see why not right
[03:01:29] yeah I don't see why not
[03:01:35] just dendro's really low though so it's
[03:01:36] like you wouldn't like solo dendro baiju
[03:01:39] but
[03:01:41] yeah I mean unless you just want a
[03:01:42] shield and you want like the thing
[03:01:45] like the the passive the proc
[03:01:49] well you have Beto Triple Crown I don't
[03:01:51] I think she's just one Crown right
[03:01:57] yeah she's crowned once her skill isn't
[03:01:59] crowned it's just
[03:02:02] can I use silver wolf of them yeah you
[03:02:03] could play Moto hydro and implants Hydro
[03:02:05] if you want but I don't actually I don't
[03:02:07] recommend motohydro with him because
[03:02:08] silver wolf yeah she's broken but so his
[03:02:10] essential passive gives him more damage
[03:02:12] with other reactions but also and that's
[03:02:14] not everything also
[03:02:17] um he typically uh doesn't synergize
[03:02:21] well with Hydro characters because like
[03:02:22] sure you could use Mona sure you could
[03:02:25] like call me if you want a Healer but
[03:02:26] like Yolanda and Synchro don't really
[03:02:28] work with him then like most Hydro
[03:02:29] characters don't
[03:02:33] also Chad this is
[03:02:40] dude this thing gives you it makes your
[03:02:43] charge attack damage
[03:02:44] makes your chargeback deal 110 125 or
[03:02:47] 160 of its original damage which means
[03:02:49] three stocks that's 60 more damage and
[03:02:52] it's not just damage bonus from my
[03:02:54] understanding this is like changing the
[03:02:55] like
[03:02:57] it's not just plus damage bonus it's
[03:02:58] like basically a scaling
[03:03:01] which is pretty pog
[03:03:05] so yeah although I
[03:03:07] I think this is like low-key bait like
[03:03:09] it's good but usually you'll only have
[03:03:11] two stacks like I think it's kind of
[03:03:12] bait to [ __ ] your team up to get a third
[03:03:14] sack
[03:03:17] that's insane yeah it's really good
[03:03:21] um
[03:03:22] it makes it to where a team like this
[03:03:23] like your last thought being strongly is
[03:03:25] like really nice
[03:03:26] uh or you get C1 I think it's a bit bait
[03:03:29] to be like
[03:03:32] let's say you have a taser team like or
[03:03:34] like hyper Bloom and you're like
[03:03:37] well I guess taser is a better example
[03:03:39] but like let's say you don't have Zhang
[03:03:40] Lee I think it's a bit bait if you have
[03:03:42] two stacks like correct me if you guys
[03:03:44] disagree but I think it's bait if you
[03:03:46] have a team like this that's like really
[03:03:48] good and you're like [ __ ] I need three
[03:03:49] stacks as passive so you bench Beto for
[03:03:51] like a bad character that wouldn't make
[03:03:52] sense there like if you have a strong
[03:03:54] lead it makes sense but if you're using
[03:03:55] like a random support that wouldn't
[03:03:57] really be good like you randomly just
[03:03:59] put data there to proca vaporize I think
[03:04:01] that would be bad
[03:04:03] um
[03:04:04] but like it's just it's nice if you can
[03:04:13] okay let me do the boss man
[03:04:16] that's fine yeah I think like generally
[03:04:19] you go to stocks but some of his teams
[03:04:21] can get three and then with C1 you
[03:04:23] always get three
[03:04:25] what if we hyperloom well if you
[03:04:27] hyperbloom so this is what happens if
[03:04:29] you have your blue
[03:04:30] if you like the bloom you have two
[03:04:31] stacks inherently because you are first
[03:04:34] of all blooming and second of all you
[03:04:35] can electrocharge
[03:04:37] then your last slot can be whatever you
[03:04:39] can use another Electro you can use Beto
[03:04:41] yeah whatever you can use another dentro
[03:04:43] especially if you don't have Nikita you
[03:04:44] might want more dead drop
[03:04:46] um
[03:04:48] or
[03:04:50] you could try to get an extra Hydra
[03:04:53] thing you do a hydro swirl if you play
[03:04:54] Someone Like kazua You could do like
[03:04:57] Zhang Li you can crystallize whatever
[03:04:58] zhangi can work so you can Flex
[03:05:01] I don't think Neville teams need a
[03:05:04] Healer
[03:05:05] because navient heals himself
[03:05:08] and you can run prototype Amber if
[03:05:10] you're using the free to play option
[03:05:12] uh but and you can run a shield like
[03:05:14] song leave but healers can be nice you
[03:05:16] can use a shielder A Healer
[03:05:19] like look he heals here if I do this
[03:05:22] boom we're healed back up
[03:05:24] half HP but yeah
[03:05:29] I'm dead
[03:05:42] Lilo killed him yeah
[03:05:43] [Music]
[03:05:51] Not Dead
[03:06:10] all right
[03:06:19] can I eat hit him from there I'll hit
[03:06:22] this fast
[03:06:29] if you don't still issue you'll be
[03:06:30] banned mods anyone that have skill issue
[03:06:32] permanently just literally destroy them
[03:06:34] don't just ban them destroy them
[03:06:37] yeah
[03:06:42] I should probably wait for Ben and burst
[03:06:44] actually
[03:06:46] longest oh never mind wait okay
[03:06:50] [Music]
[03:06:53] I can swallow the shot without dying
[03:06:55] cool
[03:07:03] oh I mean that could be good I don't
[03:07:06] know on who but crib rate ER and yeah
[03:07:08] could be good
[03:07:19] got the weapon I need you to see you
[03:07:21] suffer
[03:07:23] I'll do one more Temple
[03:07:27] one more Temple
[03:07:30] oh what
[03:07:34] wait that's early
[03:07:38] okay now we're lucky so I'm just gonna
[03:07:42] lose a [ __ ] challenge half the
[03:07:44] cosplay [ __ ] G
[03:07:46] no spoilers I'm sorry
[03:07:50] watch the video if you want to know how
[03:07:51] that went
[03:07:53] hey we got it I'm happy what the [ __ ] we
[03:07:55] got
[03:08:00] yo we got it
[03:08:02] what the [ __ ] we got the best Catalyst
[03:08:05] in the game then the second best
[03:08:07] Catalyst in the game
[03:08:10] and then the Third
[03:08:13] then we got Tom
[03:08:15] I got a fav Lance
[03:08:25] um
[03:08:32] dude look at this this looks so [ __ ]
[03:08:34] sick it looks so sick dude
[03:08:44] the pages are blue
[03:08:47] you know your vas are filled with ads
[03:08:49] you can't go 20 minutes without one wait
[03:08:51] really do I get paid for that I feel
[03:08:53] like I don't
[03:08:54] is there a way to change that maybe I
[03:08:56] just upload Vlogs on YouTube
[03:08:58] that's weird
[03:09:00] I guess you could just sub to not get
[03:09:02] odds uh subscribe for free using Twitter
[03:09:03] sorry
[03:09:10] pull for the attack on Titan sword [ __ ]
[03:09:12] I didn't get the new sword I forgot
[03:09:14] about that
[03:09:20] why do so many ores damn I used to be
[03:09:22] broke on this [ __ ]
[03:09:25] I have some of yours
[03:09:37] do you want that sword yeah I mean I
[03:09:39] want to have an HP sword I don't have
[03:09:41] any I don't have a key
[03:09:51] why am I using my one star mats
[03:09:53] it's such a waste of time
[03:10:05] is it good yeah
[03:10:14] foreign
[03:10:29] better than C1 uh there is a helpful
[03:10:33] graph by Navid let means that I'll link
[03:10:36] in my that's going to be in my video so
[03:10:39] shout out to them but tldr this is my
[03:10:42] thing the only reason I'm using that is
[03:10:43] to shorten the length of the section
[03:10:45] because I talked about it for five
[03:10:46] minutes and I was like I probably
[03:10:47] shouldn't talk about it for [ __ ] six
[03:10:48] like six minutes so I like put a recap
[03:10:50] on screen but basically listen okay
[03:10:54] his C1 does two things but each of the
[03:10:56] two things are good but how good they
[03:10:59] are varies on a few factors so depending
[03:11:01] on how good each of them are
[03:11:03] is how good a C1 is
[03:11:05] his weapon is always good the main time
[03:11:07] when it's bad is if you're planning on
[03:11:09] getting like an R5 sack Jade if you want
[03:11:11] like soccer soccer is not that far
[03:11:13] behind at R5 it's like 10 to 15 whereas
[03:11:16] at R1 it's like 20 and then
[03:11:19] uh comparing Tome to every other weapon
[03:11:21] is like 30 to 40 it's pretty [ __ ]
[03:11:23] good
[03:11:24] bro that Amber's really good though
[03:11:27] however
[03:11:31] however
[03:11:34] um
[03:11:35] however
[03:11:37] C1 always gives you one stack of your
[03:11:40] passive for free
[03:11:44] I'm just trying to pull up the weapon
[03:11:46] ranking to see if I forgot anything but
[03:11:47] C1 always gives you one stack of your
[03:11:50] passive for free
[03:11:52] also always gives you resistance
[03:11:53] Interruption now the one stock of the
[03:11:55] passive doesn't actually matter in teams
[03:11:57] where you would already have three
[03:11:58] stacks anyways and if that's one that
[03:12:00] you're that you're that you're planning
[03:12:01] on playing then who gives a [ __ ] about
[03:12:03] that part of your C1 the second part of
[03:12:05] the C1 is resistance Interruption and if
[03:12:07] you're kiting you're using your massive
[03:12:09] Hydro [ __ ] from really far away uh and
[03:12:11] you're fighting enemies that are let's
[03:12:12] say like this wall thing fence is an
[03:12:15] enemy and you're like here you're
[03:12:16] probably not getting hit
[03:12:18] um
[03:12:19] or if you're running Zhang Li a shield
[03:12:21] then you might not need the resistance
[03:12:22] Interruption so how good C1 is depends
[03:12:25] on that in general it's really nice it's
[03:12:27] damage and it's quality of life but how
[03:12:29] good each of those things are varies
[03:12:31] based on you and your team and your
[03:12:32] weapon well weapon in terms of how
[03:12:34] valuable his signature is so it's like
[03:12:36] it's it's hard to answer it just it
[03:12:38] depends I like C1 I might actually get
[03:12:41] it just because I think it's cool
[03:12:43] but um
[03:12:45] yeah
[03:12:47] yeah dude which is okay we weapon ranked
[03:12:49] what's this what was the Jeff weapon
[03:12:50] aggressive but even before that like
[03:12:52] what's it is so winseth is like bad
[03:12:56] right it's like no no wasn't this broken
[03:12:57] but for uh naviette it's supposed to be
[03:13:00] bad because it's like
[03:13:02] attack is garbage and EM is garbage for
[03:13:05] him so only the elemental damage is good
[03:13:07] but the elemental damage is so good that
[03:13:09] when you average out all three even with
[03:13:12] like the [ __ ] uptime that it has it's
[03:13:14] still like on par with this free
[03:13:16] development like it's a bit worse but
[03:13:18] it's like almost as good as like his
[03:13:19] good options it has come to mind but I
[03:13:22] like don't use it on him use it on
[03:13:24] someone else but if you're like just
[03:13:26] trying to like big PP number for fun and
[03:13:30] you just want to like rear set until you
[03:13:31] get the elemental average bonus you can
[03:13:34] but like just because of the crit damage
[03:13:39] uh yeah
[03:13:42] it ranks pretty high
[03:13:54] but prototype Amber is pretty insane
[03:13:56] uh Ballad of the boundless blue is
[03:14:01] okay
[03:14:05] uh
[03:14:11] but Amber's usually better
[03:14:20] it's viable like Ballad of the problem
[03:14:21] is just viable but I don't recommend it
[03:14:23] over Amber it's not far behind it's like
[03:14:25] five percent like it's pretty similar
[03:14:26] but usually you don't need all the ER
[03:14:28] sometimes you don't need all there if
[03:14:30] you do you might actually if you don't
[03:14:31] have a lot of artifacts and if you do
[03:14:33] then it's pretty similar but it's
[03:14:35] usually a like for his DPS it's usually
[03:14:38] a bit worse
[03:14:39] like a little bit worse but then on top
[03:14:41] of that it's globally worse because
[03:14:43] Amber also heals your team and uh it
[03:14:46] helps with their energy needs well I
[03:14:48] actually the ballot also helps with
[03:14:49] energy needs so it doesn't matter
[03:14:51] it's mostly the second part then
[03:15:04] his best thought gains value with the ER
[03:15:05] requirements uh I I mean yeah but like
[03:15:09] you need ER in him the only time you're
[03:15:11] not gonna need ER on him is if you have
[03:15:13] his best slot or if you have prototype
[03:15:15] Amber or if your team is like double
[03:15:17] Electro Electro resonance official and
[03:15:19] like a Fab weapon because like even in
[03:15:21] double Electro with Fishel you need like
[03:15:23] 120 ER ish
[03:15:26] so like maybe more sometimes so like
[03:15:29] yeah
[03:15:41] strong is good
[03:15:45] okay
[03:15:55] actually I just remembered something I
[03:15:57] want to write down on the guide give me
[03:15:58] a second I'm gonna just sit here and
[03:16:00] hopefully not die
[03:16:25] all right sorry I don't want to forget
[03:16:27] no

[03:23:43] you lied to me
[03:23:46] I am Bruno azoro sorry audio perhaps I

[03:23:56] want that
[03:23:57] but cool good to know
[03:24:01] I did not die 14 times in 67 minutes I
[03:24:05] didn't die 14 times what are you typing
[03:24:13] me when I say random numbers
[03:24:20] this is a zero death stream
[03:24:23] at least as far as controllable ones go
[03:24:26] wait till I get in the abyss there will
[03:24:28] be zero mistakes I literally got a full
[03:24:30] showcase clip without even resetting
[03:24:32] once not even kidding
[03:24:37] you watch zombies live action yeah I
[03:24:38] watch like seven episodes I don't know
[03:24:39] how many there are but I'm like almost
[03:24:41] done it I liked it
[03:25:01] well you watch the anime I mean probably
[03:25:02] because it's probably only like 20
[03:25:03] episodes right because episode one and
[03:25:05] the episode one they find the one piece
[03:25:07] map they're like oh let's just find it
[03:25:09] and then they just go find it and that
[03:25:10] probably takes like what 20 episodes 30
[03:25:12] maybe that's it it's done they found the
[03:25:14] map that's it done boom gg gg that's it
[03:25:17] it's probably like 30 episodes I don't
[03:25:19] see why would drag on longer than that
[03:25:21] Death Note was like [ __ ] 30. and it
[03:25:24] stopped being good at like halfway
[03:25:25] through so they could have made it like
[03:25:26] 20. 15. that's it
[03:25:55] I'm trolley I mean okay something being
[03:25:57] I feel like it being long is not a bad
[03:25:59] thing though like it doesn't matter
[03:26:02] it just means I'm I'm never gonna have
[03:26:04] time but it's fine
[03:26:13] long is good yep
[03:26:16] yep
[03:26:19] I mean true you don't want it to be over
[03:26:21] and then you're sad you have nothing to
[03:26:22] do

[03:40:31] oh a second
[03:40:35] all right
[03:40:37] [ __ ] is happening here
[03:40:39] I don't want to spoil this place I want
[03:40:41] to explore it so that's TP let's go here
[03:40:47] okay
[03:40:49] probably need to go both ways we'll
[03:40:50] start with up
[03:41:04] wood next question
[03:41:11] wait one second shot we're almost done
[03:41:13] leveling him which is [ __ ] POG
[03:41:14] finally
[03:41:17] um let me do this
[03:41:25] little bro isn't gonna explore I can't
[03:41:28] why would you say that when I clearly am
[03:41:30] an explorator
[03:41:36] wait there's no there's no more here we
[03:41:38] have to go over here
[03:41:46] it's fine it's their Crystal fight not
[03:41:47] mine true
[03:41:49] our Crystal fly
[03:42:01] I don't have the uh Lenny in this team
[03:42:07] should I level navier or keep him level
[03:42:09] one why would you pull through if he's
[03:42:10] level one
[03:42:12] I mean why I mean why would you pull
[03:42:13] over I'm gonna keep him level one
[03:42:25] because the sub detection unit
[03:42:54] can we start doing damage yet our
[03:42:56] talents are still level one
[03:42:57] should probably level our talents
[03:42:59] wow that's a start
[03:43:15] hey cookie hit chorus yeah you can uh
[03:43:18] you just have to stay a bit closer maybe
[03:43:20] that can play from really far but if
[03:43:21] you're playing kooky or shangling you
[03:43:22] want to be a bit further I do think yeah
[03:43:24] M Ryden is insane with him because you
[03:43:25] don't really need a Healer but I guess
[03:43:27] in hyperloom you might take core damage
[03:43:29] so kind of but yeah
[03:43:44] Hydro HP goblet Hydra
[03:43:47] foreign
[03:43:55] [ __ ]

[03:44:01] good with them

[03:44:14] his skill does like his skill and bursts
[03:44:16] are like wow uh yolan skill but you
[03:44:19] might as well level them it's just not
[03:44:21] nearly as important
[03:44:48] okay thanks to the world I appreciate it
[03:44:50] so I have to refer to my channel let's
[03:44:52] see what draw strong air drops are on
[03:44:53] I'm still scamming but I'm not W not a
[03:44:57] scammer
[03:44:58] W stripper
[03:45:01] how much credit if you need magically
[03:45:02] gives you 30 uh six so just subtract
[03:45:06] whatever you're going for so let's say
[03:45:07] 100 minus 36.
[03:45:12] but you can be okay with like 70 80 90
[03:45:14] depending on how investment you are
[03:45:17] there's never a stopping point for crit
[03:45:19] rate except maybe like 92 if you want
[03:45:22] um
[03:45:23] if you're planning to get like because
[03:45:25] there's a good chance to get a critter a
[03:45:27] card in 412 like in one of the floors
[03:45:29] but you might not so
[03:45:34] mine have yet uh in my showcase that 80
[03:45:37] crit rate on top of the 36 because I'm
[03:45:39] [ __ ] stupid but here's what it is

[03:50:31] I was watching someone uh do a combo
[03:50:34] with her it was uh it looked like uh he
[03:50:36] did a normal attack and then he jumped I
[03:50:37] think and it looked so they said that
[03:50:39] she was a bit worse than your Mia I
[03:50:40] think
[03:50:41] if I use that
[03:50:47] why is triangling there
[03:50:49] oppa
[03:50:51] it's always changing

[03:52:01] like Hotel gameplay feels completely
[03:52:04] [ __ ] different with it without it
[03:52:05] it's like not even close it's she's
[03:52:06] still good c0 it's just way different
[03:52:08] and it's damage increase
[03:52:11] it's like a lot better but Yolanda's
[03:52:13] like I would get jelanci one because I
[03:52:15] think it's convenient to run around and

[03:59:23] constellation is the dragon look at this
[03:59:25] [ __ ]
[03:59:26] this is [ __ ] melodic
[03:59:32] I didn't even notice this
[03:59:36] he's a literal dragon
[03:59:47] well actually it's Kyogre
[03:59:57] this is him
[03:59:59] well I need a better picture of this
[04:00:00] whatever these look disgusting I can't
[04:00:02] find one he's [ __ ] Kyogre dude
[04:00:05] I thought he was melodic at first but
[04:00:07] nah this is this one he's this thing but
[04:00:09] Hydro beaming
[04:00:12] Rayquaza but blue
[04:00:14] yeah but he's like water
[04:00:19] Dragonair yeah this does look like it no
[04:00:22] the his Constitution looks more like
[04:00:23] melodic
[04:00:25] but I don't think he is melodic
[04:00:28] oh 45 nice
[04:00:30] all right thanks for your world
[04:00:32] thank you
[04:00:36] quick review
[04:00:40] not bad Jade spear two for us and two
[04:00:42] Sherman always nice nice nice nice nice
[04:00:45] nice good job
[04:00:50] after walking this is like 15 months I
[04:00:52] appreciate it that is 14 months more
[04:00:54] than one
[04:00:55] sorry that was weird
[04:01:05] I want official which Banner is better
[04:01:07] depends on which one you want
[04:01:10] also for the record people ask him never
[04:01:12] death is good I am currently debating
[04:01:14] between having my titles say insane or
[04:01:17] broken I'm not sure yet I think insane
[04:01:19] I'm leaning more towards insane
[04:01:21] for those wondering
[04:01:31] I gotta show you what it looks like
[04:01:37] like I'm kind of waiting for math to be
[04:01:40] done as well to like make sure it's not
[04:01:41] just my cake now because I don't want to
[04:01:43] just like misinformation
[04:01:47] but um
[04:01:49] playing I never had a bad experience
[04:01:51] playing him at all I don't give a [ __ ]
[04:01:53] feel like oh he might need for arena
[04:01:55] I'll hide them uh uh nilu like
[04:01:58] no I'm not gonna compare to iPhone
[04:01:59] because that's different but yeah ah
[04:02:03] even if he does get better with her
[04:02:04] which he might he might not I don't know
[04:02:06] he feels really good right now so it
[04:02:07] doesn't matter
[04:02:18] surely don't know I mean I actually
[04:02:19] don't know but the thing is
[04:02:21] so with this C1 you kind of like you can
[04:02:24] run well you can always run only two
[04:02:26] reactions with him you don't need the
[04:02:27] third first passive but with C1 it like
[04:02:29] favors it because then you can run two
[04:02:30] and still get the three stacks whatever
[04:02:33] um
[04:02:33] the thing is you stole it being able to
[04:02:37] run if there is a good Hydro with him
[04:02:39] you get hydro residence which is 25 HP
[04:02:41] so
[04:02:42] she wants to work with the archon if she
[04:02:45] her kid works with him right because
[04:02:47] it's just a free 25 HP as of right now
[04:02:50] there's not that many Hydra characters
[04:02:51] that work well with him though outside
[04:02:52] of maybe an Anila team or like if you
[04:02:55] need a Healer kind of you don't really
[04:02:56] want a Healer a lot of times uh and like
[04:02:59] you can use Mona but Mona's Mona
[04:03:02] what's wrong with Mona nothing but no so
[04:03:04] it's like yeah
[04:03:07] you can use your lawn like you can
[04:03:08] normal attack if you want like you can
[04:03:10] normal attack in between your charge
[04:03:11] attacks it's just not ideal
[04:03:21] ha
[04:03:26] okay I don't feel like fighting this
[04:03:27] thing with no energy
[04:03:29] I don't feel like doing that I'm sorry I
[04:03:32] don't feel like [ __ ] going through
[04:03:33] that
[04:03:41] how about Candace with him
[04:03:47] I'm sorry
[04:03:49] I'm so sorry
[04:03:55] I mean
[04:03:58] she'll look good which is a positive so
[04:04:02] if that's what you care about
[04:04:04] you can do it
[04:04:10] disappear here worthless
[04:04:19] 20.
[04:04:23] um
[04:04:31] [ __ ] it I don't normally full refresh
[04:04:34] but it's a whole new region should I or
[04:04:35] I could use the fragile but fragile is
[04:04:37] good for videos
[04:04:38] I don't normally do this I promise if
[04:04:40] you're a new viewer I actually never do
[04:04:41] this actually actually I saw that 150. I
[04:04:44] know my limit play Within it I saw the
[04:04:46] 150 I'm not even kidding I'm humble I'm
[04:04:48] not even kidding
[04:04:51] can I 90m can I 90 him or do I need one
[04:04:53] more one more okay we'll wait two
[04:04:55] minutes one more and then we're done
[04:04:56] in the meantime Let's uh do some do some
[04:04:59] stuff
[04:05:00] let's do some things
[04:05:07] okay someone in chat wrote when is daily
[04:05:09] fate hey guys hey guys hey guys hey guys
[04:05:11] hey guys hey guys hey guys I don't know
[04:05:13] what that means but this looks cringe so
[04:05:15] because of that uh one minute timeout
[04:05:18] just because I cringed
[04:05:26] this stream is not a safe space you can
[04:05:28] get timed out for making me cringe
[04:05:31] what shall we do
[04:05:34] what shall we do
[04:05:44] you're so done done done

[04:06:01] testing geez what's wrong with this mic
[04:06:07] okay
[04:06:10] perhaps we could take a walk by a
[04:06:12] Riverbank or somewhere similarly Fluval
[04:06:22] Chad should we do this or kokomi here
[04:06:25] probably I assume we want the extra
[04:06:27] dendro
[04:06:28] I assume probably need to test this a
[04:06:31] bit more
[04:06:39] reverse Bloom scratch I mean yeah
[04:06:41] ideally we're not reverse blooming but
[04:06:43] it's like
[04:06:45] or vice versa we are reverse like yeah
[04:06:48] vice versa ideally we are blooming with
[04:06:50] Hydro
[04:06:51] but uh
[04:06:54] we don't want naviette to bloom
[04:07:00] like you don't wanna I don't want to

[04:11:40] gonna put elegy on your lawn
[04:11:43] our weapons level 80 are never that's
[04:11:45] level 80. so there's like Improvement
[04:11:46] that can be done but it is what it is
[04:11:48] um although I'm pretty sure I could get
[04:11:49] this right now if I want to
[04:11:51] but it's fine
[04:11:54] I want to do my best friend first
[04:12:00] um
[04:12:05] my apologies this heavy rain must be
[04:12:08] quite an inconvenience for you
[04:12:17] I'm gonna run the weakest wrongly Shield
[04:12:19] known to man because we are on four
[04:12:21] Petra but with no HP piece well HP
[04:12:24] sounds but no HP on the rest uh so our
[04:12:26] hp's gonna be very low but it is what it
[04:12:28] is
[04:12:28] stringless official on four golden
[04:12:31] troops our ratio looks dog [ __ ] but it's
[04:12:33] okay and then Freedom sworn forward with
[04:12:36] that said I actually lied I'm not gonna
[04:12:38] use stringless here because it looks so
[04:12:39] bad I feel bad uh so we're gonna modify
[04:12:43] this a little bit to make it a bit
[04:12:44] better
[04:12:48] um
[04:12:56] also em is useless because we're not
[04:12:58] actually
[04:13:07] we have so many ways to Stats if we're
[04:13:09] not aggravating
[04:13:16] okay
[04:13:22] I'm gonna Nerf my official I'm gonna go
[04:13:23] 2tf I don't care I don't care I'm going
[04:13:26] to TF I don't care I don't care I don't
[04:13:28] care if this is better I don't care do I
[04:13:30] care no he does not care
[04:13:38] it's like so much wasted em dude em is
[04:13:41] useless if we're not aggravating
[04:13:45] I guess we'll electrocharge but like
[04:13:47] [ __ ]
[04:13:49] I'm not aggravating dude
[04:13:58] like what is this
[04:14:00] foreign
[04:14:11] golden troop feather
[04:14:16] oh this is a this is actually better
[04:14:18] here because we don't need it
[04:14:20] yeah sure
[04:14:29] okay
[04:14:30] it is time I'm gonna forget to clean
[04:14:32] these I'm gonna clean them all
[04:14:41] it is now time
[04:14:44] New Village time this character is
[04:14:46] [ __ ] stupidly strong
[04:14:48] uh I tested him with level 9 normal
[04:14:51] attacks weapon level 90 and him level
[04:14:53] 90. unfortunately right now we are Level
[04:14:56] 80. talent's a bit lower he's gonna feel
[04:14:58] a bit worse
[04:15:00] but with that said
[04:15:02] let me show you guys something actually
[04:15:04] no other character
[04:15:06] we're no last lot
[04:15:09] look at this
[04:15:11] this [ __ ]
[04:15:21] check
[04:15:23] be sanctified
[04:15:25] why the [ __ ] that guy did whatever
[04:15:29] are we not quitting
[04:15:31] no I don't know
[04:15:33] lucky well I look terrible
[04:15:36] Petra for the win yeah strongly in this
[04:15:38] team is kind of griefing I guess it
[04:15:40] Buffs your facial but it depends on your
[04:15:42] order you might not even stop shot it
[04:15:48] okay but why what type of dudes I didn't
[04:15:50] mean to do that
[04:15:52] wait let me actually throw a Hydraulics
[04:15:56] let the mighty be humbled
[04:16:01] 36s per second and you can do it from
[04:16:04] really far I'm gonna get hit here it's
[04:16:05] fine but you got like a really long
[04:16:07] range so like it's actually pretty
[04:16:08] [ __ ] good damage here we have no real
[04:16:10] like our swirl we're off so we're not
[04:16:12] Progressive under a box but it's still
[04:16:13] like and like I don't think he's a hyper
[04:16:15] carrier I know a lot of people are going
[04:16:16] to play him like one I mean this team
[04:16:18] makes him look like one but like usually
[04:16:19] you run official here or you run like
[04:16:21] hyperbloom or you run official Beto or
[04:16:23] you run like other stuff too so it's not
[04:16:25] like just him doing [ __ ]
[04:16:28] shop which is pretty good
[04:16:30] uh I want to get these orbs [ __ ] it
[04:16:32] yes oh never mind they broke
[04:16:36] but yeah so let me put an actual team
[04:16:41] you can use sucrose uh but I like Carlos
[04:16:44] and I also like ventians venti is also
[04:16:46] good with him because
[04:16:48] he can just hit everything and venti's
[04:16:50] burst really really easily
[04:16:53] Sugo says Ian is kind of wasted so she's
[04:16:55] not like the best option
[04:16:57] um well not always wasted like you can
[04:16:59] play hyperbloom use it as the last slot
[04:17:03] but yeah
[04:17:06] where is New Village
[04:17:13] there it is
[04:17:16] official
[04:17:17] zombie
[04:17:20] the hyperloom team I cleared once no
[04:17:22] retries instantly and it was really good
[04:17:24] this team has to reset a bunch to make
[04:17:25] sure I was like swirling both and [ __ ]
[04:17:27] if I'm streaming I probably won't care
[04:17:28] that much so expect a few mistakes but
[04:17:31] it is what it is
[04:17:32] uh because like I'm not gonna be like
[04:17:35] yeah to uh anal about it
[04:17:40] no let's play Dale [ __ ] it
[04:17:50] preloading excuses shut the [ __ ] up
[04:17:58] stabilize
[04:18:00] I picked that up too early
[04:18:03] as one with wind and Cloud the tides
[04:18:07] beckon and now my location is gonna go
[04:18:09] immune but like this damage 40K 40K 40K
[04:18:12] 40K 40K 40K like if you didn't go immune
[04:18:14] there he'd be [ __ ] dead we could do
[04:18:15] another
[04:18:17] again he's still [ __ ] immune cause
[04:18:18] this boss sucks dick but it's fine
[04:18:21] we'll use another E before swapping to
[04:18:22] get some energy I'm gonna catch it on
[04:18:24] him now we're gonna apply nope I don't
[04:18:26] have my Oz
[04:18:27] I could have helped it but I'm stupid
[04:18:31] okay I mean it's just not lucky but
[04:18:33] whatever fly Hydro can I swirl bro no I
[04:18:36] can't I [ __ ] up it's fine
[04:18:39] oh you're hit dude he keeps dashing
[04:18:46] does the best helps them a lot shut the
[04:18:47] [ __ ] up
[04:18:49] wow magu Kanki makes him look so good
[04:18:55] he actually has really good AOE so if it
[04:18:57] wasn't single Target that actually
[04:18:58] wouldn't necessarily
[04:19:00] um
[04:19:00] um it would be shown a bit easier
[04:19:04] be sanctified
[04:19:06] silence and he's dead 40K 40K 40K 40K 48
[04:19:10] I'm gonna Dodge this perfectly boom I
[04:19:12] dodged it perfectly now I'm gonna wait
[04:19:13] uh I don't know why I'm swirling Electro
[04:19:15] but I need the energy so we're pressing
[04:19:16] buttons
[04:19:17] I'm gonna reshield here hydrocrystallize
[04:19:20] eat swirl that [ __ ] three summon Oz
[04:19:23] please don't Dash away from me please
[04:19:24] don't
[04:19:28] but as you can see oh I don't have the
[04:19:30] orbs [ __ ]
[04:19:32] that's all good no rest for the wicked
[04:19:35] gather
[04:19:36] make sure I swirl Hydro in a second I'm
[04:19:39] gonna swap the kazoo now oh I didn't get
[04:19:42] it unlucky I mean whatever still gonna
[04:19:44] be fine
[04:19:45] like I'm not gonna use this for a video
[04:19:46] but like you guys can still see like no
[04:19:49] it's good but let me wait till we
[04:19:51] actually don't [ __ ] up
[04:19:55] what did I move forward
[04:20:08] worthless I'm so sad to wander power
[04:20:10] crap chow or my shout would be able to
[04:20:12] clear this by plunging all of them at
[04:20:14] once

[04:22:02] a bit better like I don't want to just
[04:22:03] like do a terrible thing but official
[04:22:06] didn't get her burst back like my
[04:22:07] particles aren't lined up because we
[04:22:09] started this with no bursts well like
[04:22:10] not a lot of bursts I [ __ ] it's fine
[04:22:31] do this
[04:22:33] this then we should have Oz back up no
[04:22:36] we don't
[04:22:37] please give me all please
[04:22:48] you got hydro pump though
[04:22:53] but like already pretty good we just
[04:22:55] need to I need the maybe a funnel energy
[04:22:57] I just won't use Fishel for the shield
[04:22:59] I'll say official that's what I'm gonna
[04:23:00] do I'll save Oz I'm Gonna Save Us
[04:23:03] that I might as well get the
[04:23:05] hydrocrystallized before it's too late
[04:23:06] because it lasts for 30 seconds of
[04:23:07] stocks I think I kind of forget guide
[04:23:10] maker by the way
[04:23:13] win strategy okay now we summon us I
[04:23:16] don't have a swirl for that though
[04:23:26] nice I got it
[04:23:28] and now he's dead 50k's 50K
[04:23:40] wait why am I doing better now than the
[04:23:43] footage I recorded
[04:23:45] my talents are lower my Navidad is level
[04:23:49] 80 and my weapon is level 80.
[04:23:54] [ __ ]
[04:23:56] oh maybe my Abyss I didn't have an abyss
[04:23:58] card that gave me damage and I got HP
[04:23:59] maybe that's why
[04:24:04] oh you had 80 crit raid
[04:24:19] oh I might have to use this see how it
[04:24:21] slices The Raid I will Hydro Cog for you
[04:24:24] right when we're done this

[04:25:00] mod check I get out of it is it good
[04:25:16] I am Novia
[04:25:18] what is this enemy oh these
[04:25:23] midnight fantastic as one with wind and
[04:25:26] clouds
[04:25:33] I don't know what the folks happening
[04:25:34] for like two seconds
[04:25:45] strike
[04:25:51] um
[04:26:09] yeah he's pretty insane
[04:26:13] foreign
[04:26:20] getting picked more often now
[04:26:23] uh I mean zhangly is nice for him but
[04:26:26] like he also Zhang also patches your
[04:26:28] skill issue look I want you strongly
[04:26:29] here this is the part where these
[04:26:31] enemies are annoying as [ __ ] too so you
[04:26:32] kind of want the resistance Interruption
[04:26:33] but like look even without it
[04:26:36] you're fine I don't need the shield I
[04:26:38] don't need C1 like it helps this enemy
[04:26:41] can [ __ ] trap you like now I would
[04:26:42] want it because I might get hit but like
[04:26:45] it's fine right who cares
[04:26:48] that could be a Beto there it could be
[04:26:51] um like nahita if you want a hyper blue
[04:26:52] it could be a yai it could be a whatever
[04:26:56] but jungle is good in this team strongly
[04:26:58] is actually pretty good
[04:27:00] so yeah
[04:27:07] okay [ __ ] I did better than the footage
[04:27:10] I recorded
[04:27:11] for the the video so I oh [ __ ] I'm gonna
[04:27:15] have to level 90 of them well I want to
[04:27:16] level 90 but dude
[04:27:25] all right
[04:27:29] foreign
[04:27:31] is it really that much different let me
[04:27:32] look really fast let me look really fast
[04:27:33] I hit 50k crits here what do I have
[04:27:36] recorded
[04:27:38] showcase let me pull this up
[04:27:42] um
[04:27:44] that's me molding
[04:27:46] hey where is it uh where is it
[04:27:50] uh what should I do what should I do
[04:27:55] 46 48k I do 48k I mean it's not that
[04:28:00] much less than 50 right
[04:28:02] I could just keep using it I don't have
[04:28:04] to remake it
[04:28:08] 50s cooler it is cooler but
[04:28:14] the 50
[04:28:16] a level 80 which I was level 90. level
[04:28:18] eight I was level nine and level 80
[04:28:21] weapon
[04:28:22] so it's like there's room for
[04:28:24] improvement and there's growth here
[04:28:26] my interview that could be girthier
[04:28:40] foreign
[04:28:46] I guess I could just change the Showcase
[04:28:49] intro to be like I'm using my level 80
[04:28:51] one because I don't have like he just
[04:28:53] came out and even with that whatever
[04:28:57] I guess I could just do that it's more
[04:28:58] impressive if he's level 80 anyways it
[04:29:00] doesn't matter that much but it's like
[04:29:01] minus one Talent level
[04:29:03] and uh 10 weapon levels
[04:29:06] so whatever weapon levels are kind of
[04:29:08] misleading because he doesn't scale on
[04:29:09] base attack but the crit damage is uh
[04:29:11] eight percent is it eight percent more
[04:29:13] wait it doesn't even increase oh no it
[04:29:15] does does level 90. how much is that
[04:29:17] level now is it 88 it's 88 it's the same
[04:29:19] as uh Aqua yeah idiot
[04:29:24] same as aqua
[04:29:30] okay time to play hyper

[04:30:44] time was I talking that much let's see
[04:30:46] this is shot
[04:30:52] oh my ALT Stone
[04:30:55] it's fine

[04:31:07] okay I talk a bit too much
[04:31:10] I can just lower it it's fine
[04:31:16] okay whatever
[04:31:21] all right whatever I'll just mean it I
[04:31:23] mean I don't want to meet it because I
[04:31:25] need the background like audio so I'll
[04:31:26] put it like quiet
[04:31:27] what is this oh my God
[04:31:34] goodbye everybody
[04:31:38] I thought this was official I checked

[04:31:57] [ __ ]
[04:32:00] settled down
[04:32:02] can I [ __ ] swirl Hydro I'm dead
[04:32:14] why the [ __ ] am I playing strongly here
[04:32:28] is hydroxy metal
[04:32:31] please don't play high drips even if yet

[04:32:35] that much you generate enough on them
[04:32:38] please anything but that
[04:32:48] where is Cookie shinobu
[04:32:51] I found her
[04:32:55] with my eye geared
[04:32:59] [ __ ] I don't think so
[04:33:16] the reason I'm using yai over Beto is
[04:33:18] because I don't feel like making sure my
[04:33:20] Beto has a million ER or having to
[04:33:22] funnel particles to her or having to
[04:33:24] think about oh [ __ ] my burst isn't ready
[04:33:26] because that tells me
[04:33:28] so we are going to play a team that
[04:33:30] isn't dependent on bursts so that if I
[04:33:32] make a mistake or am not funneling
[04:33:35] particles
[04:33:36] then we are happy
[04:33:39] two years Punk

[04:41:32] if you have a good team
[04:41:34] because like Singletary doesn't matter

[04:43:58] that's actually fine how do you get the
[04:44:00] hydro crystallize but I didn't get it
[04:44:01] that's fine I could cut that off
[04:44:04] this then we should have all back up no
[04:44:06] we don't
[04:44:17] I mean this is fine I should have
[04:44:18] skilled there like if you're trying to
[04:44:19] like look at it for mistakes I could
[04:44:21] have skilled earlier no I mean I had
[04:44:23] reset here right yeah I reset okay
[04:44:25] wait

[04:47:22] know solidify
[04:47:32] fallen leaves Adorn let the mighty be
[04:47:36] humble

[04:47:40] but uh [ __ ] you
[04:47:43] I forgot to record
[04:47:45] sorry sorry
[04:47:54] [ __ ]
[04:47:57] gather
[04:48:00] the tides beckon shadow
[04:48:07] I did not throw Hydro
[04:48:19] 31 khp what the [ __ ] okay we don't have
[04:48:22] a good Petra set man who has a good
[04:48:23] [ __ ] petrol set

[04:48:28] disappear
[04:48:31] well it's high actually you applied one
[04:48:34] meal of hydro and then you
[04:48:51] let the mighty be humble
[04:48:55] Wings Of Darkness follow your head
[04:49:06] into it I thought did I that would be
[04:49:09] funny I thought I could just like okay
[04:49:10] if my strongly Shield wasn't garbage
[04:49:12] though it would have worked if my zombie
[04:49:14] shield wasn't garbage would have worked
[04:49:18] uh what do you ask I'll check that after
[04:49:29] yes
[04:49:34] it's hard to get the both of them at the
[04:49:35] same time because you
[04:49:37] that doesn't apply a lot of hydro like
[04:49:39] it's not like a big Hydro thing
[04:49:44] stabilize
[04:49:50] the tides beckoned
[04:49:54] strut

[04:50:34] is
[04:50:36] um hydropomp hits like eight times but I
[04:50:38] didn't count how many times it applies
[04:50:39] Hydra I probably should
[04:50:41] I assume it is
[04:50:46] does someone know
[04:50:49] stabilize
[04:50:51] let the mighty be humbled
[04:50:54] yeah where the [ __ ] did my Hydra though

[04:50:59] bursted Yeah official email burst it's
[04:51:01] standard for abs okay yeah
[04:51:03] makes sense
[04:51:12] solidify

[04:51:35] [Music]
[04:51:43] wait damage within seconds of sprinting
[04:51:45] is better than HP right
[04:51:47] why am I not taking that card am I down
[04:51:49] what's the cooldown on it
[04:51:52] I'll say 15.
[04:51:54] it's 50 up times that's basically 10
[04:51:57] damage
[04:52:00] it's probably still better I mean no it
[04:52:02] isn't is it
[04:52:04] might actually not be
[04:52:07] uh but official can get it too
[04:52:10] yeah because official can get it might
[04:52:11] be better
[04:52:13] okay
[04:52:18] actually I'm not gonna do it
[04:52:27] be sanctified
[04:52:29] midnight fantastic why do I burst on

[04:52:41] no one said that I just made up a
[04:52:43] chatter to be mean to that's I have
[04:52:45] something wrong with me I think
[04:52:45] something something about me not
[04:52:47] normally
[04:52:53] let the mighty be humble
[04:52:56] wait where did my Hydra go silence yeah
[04:53:01] it's not fun
[04:53:04] [ __ ] up maybe I should uh
[04:53:07] he's probably better there actually no
[04:53:08] it's not
[04:53:10] no it's not I need my cooldown of Versa
[04:53:12] reset
[04:53:14] [ __ ]
[04:53:15] gather
[04:53:16] I probably don't want my pillar to hit
[04:53:18] him in hindsight
[04:53:21] oh my awesome cool down
[04:53:22] we'll do this thing
[04:53:24] okay that works
[04:53:41] Royal
[04:53:49] this is
[04:53:52] what's wrong with me why do I speak like
[04:53:53] that why do I speak like that
[04:54:01] I don't have Oz bro
[04:54:04] Ozment this wine tastes the same as I
[04:54:07] remember
[04:54:08] but where are those
[04:54:15] average theater okay I promise this will
[04:54:18] be perfect I promise watch watch look at
[04:54:20] the sheer dedication or focus on this
[04:54:22] man let me let me hydrate
[04:54:25] okay
[04:54:26] gather
[04:54:28] the tides beckon as you wish me
[04:54:33] it's fine because I burst and then I
[04:54:35] apply Hydro
[04:54:36] can I swap into him
[04:54:38] it's fine
[04:54:41] it doesn't matter it's first part
[04:54:43] doesn't matter
[04:54:44] it's the second part that's actually
[04:54:45] hard let's get the energy gets energy
[04:54:47] about the dash away none of this matters
[04:54:49] he's not dashing away
[04:54:52] okay fine
[04:54:53] fine
[04:54:55] I'm gonna wait for him to dash I'm
[04:54:56] waiting for dash
[04:55:02] be sanctified
[04:55:06] sucks
[04:55:09] bro stole ayatos flow
[04:55:12] what does that mean
[04:55:14] was my first eight second cooldown
[04:55:20] wait actually what if I do this
[04:55:27] yeah this is probably better
[04:55:35] that was good
[04:55:42] win strategy
[04:55:51] the tides beckon
[04:55:59] I should have swapped this world there
[04:56:00] if I wanted to like actually do the most
[04:56:02] damage but I don't think it mattered
[04:56:03] because it would have been a waste of
[04:56:04] time so that was pretty good
[04:56:09] that was good
[04:56:14] he's broken as all hell he's good he's
[04:56:17] very good I think he's very good
[04:56:20] I wouldn't feel like I'm clickbaiting if
[04:56:22] I put broken in the thumbnail I I
[04:56:24] probably won't ah I don't know I think
[04:56:26] it's really good I think it's really
[04:56:28] good
[04:56:37] only took 50 minutes shut the [ __ ] up
[04:56:41] you've already used broken on the last
[04:56:42] two not true actually
[04:56:44] dude but it was official what you think
[04:56:46] fishel's not broken officials like the
[04:56:48] officials officials fiddle's broken
[04:56:50] visual is broken
[04:56:53] foreign
[04:57:01] he's not the most Ripley friendly um he
[04:57:04] has a lot of teams but
[04:57:05] his build is pretty specific he has a
[04:57:07] good free-to-play weapon but his build
[04:57:09] is the only one there's only one set you
[04:57:11] can go team wise you can make do but you
[04:57:14] usually there's not like the best
[04:57:15] Replacements like sucrose is a lot worse
[04:57:17] than Caso there unless you're playing
[04:57:19] like
[04:57:21] hyperbloom or something but
[04:57:28] but I mean causal like pretty generic as
[04:57:31] a character uh I would recommend yeah
[04:57:34] like you can always just do take normal
[04:57:35] taser like you don't have to
[04:57:38] playing him like a hyper carry is dumb
[04:57:41] especially if you're free to play
[04:57:42] like playing them in the way that I was
[04:57:45] playing him is dumb if you're free to
[04:57:46] play because you could just do this
[04:57:48] and then like
[04:57:49] ideally Causeway but jean or originally
[04:57:52] or if like you might not have those five
[04:57:54] stars you could do like
[04:57:57] um if you literally just want a shield
[04:57:58] you could play like any shielder like
[04:58:00] you do like Layla or some [ __ ] but you
[04:58:01] don't need a shield by uh beta also
[04:58:04] gives you resistance Interruption so you
[04:58:06] could do like literally anything there
[04:58:08] um you could even do sucrose even if the
[04:58:09] EM isn't that needed uh it's fine
[04:58:15] you seem like the type of fellow who
[04:58:17] enjoys plain toast dude I ordered we
[04:58:20] don't do it do we want a big Zoo place
[04:58:21] we have the dessert place in in when I
[04:58:24] was in uh Toronto and we ordered it
[04:58:26] there is an option to add any type of
[04:58:28] toast for like in a like a combo meal if
[04:58:31] you got it with like the ice cream or
[04:58:32] whatever and I was like then I clicked
[04:58:34] on Plain toast and it worked out to be
[04:58:36] plain toast for only 50 cents so I got
[04:58:38] plain toasted toast for two slices 50
[04:58:41] cents that was 25 cents a slice which
[04:58:43] wasn't bad so I ate plain toast it was
[04:58:45] pretty good I took a picture of it
[04:58:53] kind of the heater cause of both but I
[04:58:55] like causal more
[04:58:57] realistically it's nahira and then you
[04:59:00] play sucrose but I don't know I like
[04:59:01] Gaza too much
[04:59:05] like The Meta answer is pull nahida and
[04:59:07] play sucrose but
[04:59:10] I like Cosmo too much dude my [ __ ]
[04:59:13] shoulder hurts I don't know why
[04:59:18] we can play this team though
[04:59:22] Beto's just Beto's always broke like
[04:59:24] Beto's broken but or really good at
[04:59:26] least but in this Abyss she feels worse
[04:59:28] because it's first half especially uh
[04:59:32] it's one enemy and then one enemy and
[04:59:34] then twelve three is easy
[04:59:39] so it's not really her fault
[04:59:47] the [ __ ]
[04:59:56] try freeze with official would you even
[04:59:58] play Fishel if you're free steaming with
[04:59:59] him
[05:00:01] I feel like that might [ __ ] up your
[05:00:02] freezes a bit
[05:00:09] wait why is she on hydro
[05:00:33] I just compare to ayato I mean I think
[05:00:35] he's broken so that's my take right now
[05:00:42] I usually don't comment on power levels
[05:00:44] day one but I can't see a world where
[05:00:47] I'm wrong
[05:00:54] usually the my Rea my enjoyment of a
[05:00:57] character day one
[05:00:59] ends up being how good they are after
[05:01:01] like a while even if like meta changes
[05:01:05] especially recently like a while ago
[05:01:08] maybe not but
[05:01:15] like I I haven't had a bad experience in
[05:01:18] them yet so far
[05:01:19] I don't know
[05:01:26] like I can't see a world where he's bad
[05:01:28] like genuinely
[05:01:29] because like
[05:01:31] he's also like arguably the best element
[05:01:33] like Hydro like Hydro application is
[05:01:35] really good
[05:01:37] and his range is insane his damage is
[05:01:39] insane
[05:01:42] his team damage is insane Sino aware
[05:01:44] sino's good in quick bloom
[05:01:47] Sonos genuinely fine in quick Loom it's
[05:01:49] not bad
[05:01:54] but also going into Sino I had the
[05:01:56] assumption that he was just a worse
[05:01:57] kaching so it's not like I was like
[05:01:59] expecting Santa to be broken but Sino is
[05:02:02] is I would only recommend him for quick
[05:02:04] Loom
[05:02:10] foreign
[05:02:30] beta I don't know if I have enough ER in
[05:02:33] this team though we're only at 155 which
[05:02:35] probably isn't enough
[05:02:38] it actually definitely isn't enough
[05:02:42] but as they say it is what it is
[05:02:58] you scored a drop
[05:03:03] if you want to make fun of you while
[05:03:04] you're doing Abyss no
[05:03:07] there is no positive to that
[05:03:22] eyes on me
[05:03:24] eyes on me I wanted to do that
[05:03:29] I'll just counter 500 gifted if I miss
[05:03:31] the counter I missed the counter
[05:03:34] let the mighty be humble
[05:03:42] wow bad chesting what is this 500 gifts
[05:03:45] did I missed the counter I got it no 500
[05:03:48] if there were even now we're even if I
[05:03:50] missed that one I actually would have
[05:03:51] hit it out I actually put it out mods
[05:03:53] would have hit it out for me
[05:03:55] Sean
[05:03:58] yo yo why am I normal
[05:04:04] I had orbs on the ground I'm pretty sure
[05:04:06] I don't know why I normal attacked I
[05:04:08] tried to release really fast though
[05:04:15] okay we can we can get
[05:04:18] stocks
[05:04:25] well just counter watch this counter
[05:04:27] dude he waits so long
[05:04:34] oh no yes
[05:04:36] that's fine
[05:04:39] hmm
[05:04:43] is he gonna Dodge backwards find out
[05:04:46] next time on oh he isn't it
[05:04:48] this I'm gonna wait for him to dash
[05:04:51] before I cause the Oaks
[05:04:53] can you die please can you dash please
[05:04:55] can you dash please thank you
[05:04:58] oh wait Dodge I didn't dodge
[05:05:00] okay we're gonna do this special
[05:05:06] why does this uh this AI model can't
[05:05:09] keep Dash so much it's not very fun
[05:05:13] okay is that here
[05:05:15] getting hit by that
[05:05:17] this game sucks
[05:05:22] that's why you haven't played Elder ring
[05:05:23] yes it is
[05:05:33] skill issue okay if I want to clear this
[05:05:35] fast look what you do look
[05:05:37] the tides
[05:05:39] that was your hit
[05:05:41] by Royal
[05:05:42] I don't even solve the Beto
[05:05:45] what the [ __ ] does she do that I can't
[05:05:46] do on my own because she's not like
[05:05:48] actually doing that much here
[05:05:50] go
[05:05:52] settle down
[05:05:57] fallen leaves a door
[05:06:01] can I absorb that from oh dude that's
[05:06:02] unlucky
[05:06:06] that'll go ahead
[05:06:08] what the [ __ ]
[05:06:18] yeah like
[05:06:21] it's not hard if I don't try to fish
[05:06:22] like fit in beta there but Beto feels
[05:06:25] like I don't want to use her there
[05:06:28] it's more complicated
[05:06:40] ah
[05:06:42] cheers Adventure
[05:06:52] show onto the size image but I might be
[05:06:55] able to push this guy towards her
[05:07:03] unfortunate
[05:07:07] cheers
[05:07:14] ow
[05:07:16] ow
[05:07:18] ears of the store teamwork is probably
[05:07:21] not worth doing a another rotation but
[05:07:23] we'll use there [ __ ] it
[05:07:30] I'm sorry yeah
[05:07:33] wrong of this power creep
[05:07:35] love you too much power creep if every
[05:07:37] five star was Dale probably
[05:07:54] okay
[05:07:56] silence
[05:08:02] dude this thing charges so [ __ ] fast
[05:08:04] it's actually stupid there's like
[05:08:06] there's virtually zero second downtime I
[05:08:08] mean uh it's virtually a zero second
[05:08:10] charge time
[05:08:13] I saw people saying it was like a one
[05:08:14] second chart that's if you hold
[05:08:17] you hold but you can release said like
[05:08:18] instantly the ties
[05:08:25] there's no charge at all
[05:08:36] oh wait I just sucked him up for nothing
[05:08:38] so I only had two wait did I left two
[05:08:40] about your head
[05:08:45] did you die
[05:08:54] how do you do that you just let go
[05:08:55] really fast
[05:08:57] instead of just holding your charge back
[05:08:58] like you normally would you like press
[05:09:01] Mouse one or you let go of it
[05:09:05] so you like hold it for like one second
[05:09:07] like you don't just click it you hold it
[05:09:09] really briefly oh they're there I forgot
[05:09:12] worthless
[05:09:19] ears
[05:09:23] disappear
[05:09:30] worthless
[05:09:33] wow
[05:09:39] what did someone ask him
[05:09:42] if nebulance is like Wanderer
[05:09:45] how would he be like wander oh Beto's
[05:09:47] actually good here let me wait this is
[05:09:48] the one part where I actually want to
[05:09:49] use beta Let Me Wait Let Me Wait
[05:09:53] let's actually play Beto here give me a
[05:09:55] second
[05:10:12] can I
[05:10:13] burst burst Auto swirl probably
[05:10:18] care for dance Eyes On Me
[05:10:21] Be sanctified
[05:10:26] questions
[05:10:30] oh should I group them better
[05:10:33] but it is what it is
[05:10:40] Bruce no I don't
[05:10:55] hmm
[05:10:59] yeah that's pretty good
[05:11:03] a little scuffed at the start but
[05:11:05] still pretty [ __ ] fast
[05:11:21] I want to try something
[05:11:27] um what can this team do We're not gonna
[05:11:31] be built our Dale's not on em
[05:11:33] but honestly what this team can do
[05:11:46] share my knowledge well I probably
[05:11:48] should use official first
[05:11:51] hi somehow still frog burning
[05:11:54] settled down
[05:12:04] just the lines
[05:12:07] about your head
[05:12:09] dude [ __ ] there's off time is so bad
[05:12:13] man
[05:12:18] bad chest I can replace the field whoa
[05:12:23] silence
[05:12:24] I'm humble
[05:12:33] up
[05:12:37] settle down
[05:12:44] I mean that still works
[05:12:45] like I cleared like it's slow worth from
[05:12:48] an A so like
[05:12:50] but I don't recommend that one that much
[05:12:52] but like I would probably even if I'm
[05:12:54] playing virgin I'd probably play
[05:12:55] shangling
[05:12:56] but
[05:12:59] yeah I'm still gonna mention it in the
[05:13:01] team part like you can play it that's
[05:13:03] fine
[05:13:17] do do
[05:13:29] I want to see how fast this clears how
[05:13:31] long we take
[05:13:40] be Sanctified bow your head
[05:14:01] stabilize
[05:14:04] oh [ __ ] I don't have my burst
[05:14:07] dude whatever
[05:14:10] settled down
[05:14:12] the tides beckon
[05:14:26] ask is growing but it's okay gather
[05:14:32] and still though 20 is playing bad
[05:14:39] put official there it's GG
[05:14:42] how's your charger not taking seconds to
[05:14:43] charge because there's water droplets on
[05:14:45] the ground that's what his skill and
[05:14:46] burst do normally it would take this
[05:14:48] long but you never want to see this
[05:14:49] animation ever
[05:14:59] I do the animation is fire it is you can
[05:15:01] also move around in it it's pretty cool
[05:15:08] he's also super fun yeah
[05:15:26] did 5K because it's [ __ ] the Jeff
[05:15:28] what do you expect
[05:15:30] do you expect his characters to deal
[05:15:32] damage
[05:15:52] so you don't want to get droplets wait
[05:15:53] what do you mean no you do want the
[05:15:54] droplets but you don't yeah you want
[05:15:56] them
[05:15:58] the only reason you use this burst is
[05:16:00] for droplets
[05:16:01] like this scaling is 33 of your max HP
[05:16:07] your lawn is higher
[05:16:09] well not really because this is level
[05:16:11] seven
[05:16:12] and then there's also these waterfall
[05:16:14] damages but you get my point it's like
[05:16:16] this and then this plus times two I
[05:16:18] think it's like it's not this damage is
[05:16:21] dog [ __ ] this damage is dog [ __ ] it's
[05:16:23] just they give droplets which make them
[05:16:24] good
[05:16:28] just average or doctor I mean it's like
[05:16:30] a yilon skill a bit more it's like two
[05:16:31] year long skills you don't see one
[05:16:33] you'll want to see one does as much time
[05:16:34] it does this
[05:16:37] under skill motor burst
[05:16:42] but it gives you droplets and as Charter
[05:16:44] stocks are really broken because the
[05:16:45] charge hacks do
[05:16:47] whatever amount of your max HP times
[05:16:49] eight and then you can do them they only
[05:16:51] take like three seconds and you also get
[05:16:53] damage on us here and other stuff
[05:16:57] also here
[05:17:04] the obviously one no
[05:17:07] I might get it eventually
[05:17:09] convince you I'm gonna go for hotel get
[05:17:11] hotel if you like Hotel better I think
[05:17:13] this character is [ __ ] broken but
[05:17:15] that shouldn't change
[05:17:16] you wanting another character if you
[05:17:18] want to talk
[05:17:19] who does also good
[05:17:23] yeah and they are yeah hey I forgot I
[05:17:26] tweeted that
[05:17:39] I think this character is like stupid
[05:17:41] good
[05:17:43] maybe not stupid good that's the reserve
[05:17:44] for nahita kazuo he's still a DPS don't
[05:17:46] feel forcible for him I think he's
[05:17:48] really good though
[05:17:50] [Music]
[05:17:52] but it's only day one so I could be
[05:17:55] completely wrong
[05:18:02] because he does require a decent amount
[05:18:04] of investment and like team
[05:18:06] his teams are flexible but you do have
[05:18:08] to build his teams you don't even have
[05:18:10] to build his teams around him actually
[05:18:11] never mind you don't you don't
[05:18:14] you do if you want him to look good but
[05:18:16] you don't have like he doesn't have to
[05:18:19] he could just have bonus damage while
[05:18:20] he's driving
[05:18:23] doesn't C6 make it much better bro
[05:18:28] yes but it's C6
[05:18:33] you calling me do you guys more than a
[05:18:34] neighbor like child and ayato he's like
[05:18:36] the same role as Ito
[05:18:39] he just needs a bit more field time
[05:18:41] because he doesn't do as much he does
[05:18:42] nothing from all field all right so from
[05:18:44] offfield still has his burst so it could
[05:18:46] be more like you could help him more in
[05:18:48] like a bloom team
[05:18:53] yeah but I I like him a lot better
[05:19:02] as no Hydro application housing enabler
[05:19:04] I mean
[05:19:05] actually I didn't say anything I said
[05:19:07] driver
[05:19:07] which he is
[05:19:09] he's a driver or a DS or both like
[05:19:17] because his main purpose is to drive
[05:19:18] reactions like you're not trying to not
[05:19:20] proc reactions you want reactions so you
[05:19:22] want your team to do damage too
[05:19:24] foreign
[05:19:28] like you are I believe you're actively
[05:19:31] griefing if you let's say you have two
[05:19:33] stacks of your passive if your last slot
[05:19:35] is a dog [ __ ] character just to get the
[05:19:37] third stack that's bad you want your
[05:19:39] teammates to be useful like I know that
[05:19:41] sounds stupid but like you don't want
[05:19:43] just someone that is only there to
[05:19:45] increase his damage it's like you want
[05:19:46] maybe official maybe a Beto like they do
[05:19:48] good damage too or like strongly or
[05:19:50] Cosmo who like give your team damage
[05:19:53] like if it's just like
[05:19:55] like let's say this is like this
[05:19:57] increases chao's plunging scaling then
[05:20:00] like
[05:20:02] I would be fine with my last thought
[05:20:04] outside of uh farazan Bennett to be
[05:20:07] anyone of any element even if they're
[05:20:09] dog [ __ ] like I don't care if the last
[05:20:10] thought is Kirara
[05:20:12] just to [ __ ] give me more punchbox
[05:20:14] dealing but like would never let it's
[05:20:16] not really that like yeah you could do
[05:20:18] like Layla if you want like a cryo thing
[05:20:19] or like wrongly because wrong is good
[05:20:21] but like if you're just putting like a
[05:20:23] random character that does nothing
[05:20:25] it won't be better than a second
[05:20:27] election or something
[05:20:34] is it good International why I mean sure
[05:20:36] but why because you could call it
[05:20:38] judgmental true never mind good
[05:20:40] counselor argument you could play
[05:20:42] judgmental
[05:20:52] okay maybe we go do artifact um a domain
[05:20:56] a domain
[05:21:07] I think by just go to them by just a
[05:21:08] fine option
[05:21:09] biter doesn't give you that much but if
[05:21:11] you're playing maybe hyperbloom and you
[05:21:13] need a last slot like if you need more
[05:21:14] dendro because you don't have nahita or
[05:21:16] maybe nilu bloom
[05:21:18] they say bailu whatever but yeah or if
[05:21:22] maybe I mean you could also Flex slot by
[05:21:24] Drew
[05:21:26] because
[05:21:28] it's a shield
[05:21:31] um
[05:21:32] and it's this you'll stack the passive
[05:21:34] because you probably don't have another
[05:21:35] dendro if you're playing like him as a
[05:21:37] flex slot
[05:21:39] like you don't have zombie let's say if
[05:21:40] you don't have wrongly you can do
[05:21:41] official Cosmo and then that I guess
[05:21:44] would I recommend it over Beto or yai
[05:21:46] probably not
[05:21:48] but you can
[05:21:50] if you want the resistance Interruption
[05:21:51] then yes although Beto gives you some
[05:21:53] but yeah
[05:21:56] showcase judgmental
[05:22:01] um
[05:22:02] I mean I can
[05:22:08] what shall we do
[05:22:20] you can frog his passive with the same
[05:22:22] reaction you need multiple ones
[05:22:34] stabilize
[05:22:38] them too come on get them
[05:22:45] re-sanctified
[05:22:54] well that cleared a hell of a lot faster
[05:22:56] than my friend a team
[05:23:11] huh
[05:23:13] wait let me let me save that actually
[05:23:14] Keys as background footage
[05:23:39] okay
[05:23:51] what is the song it was kingslayer
[05:23:53] maybe metal
[05:23:59] okay let's do this
[05:24:03] what I just hear better say let's Light
[05:24:04] It Up
[05:24:05] let's Light It Up
[05:24:15] [Music]
[05:24:20] you tired a little bit I have to work on
[05:24:22] the video after this I shouldn't stream
[05:24:23] too long I think I'm gonna call zaj for
[05:24:26] a bit but I really have to pee but
[05:24:27] that'll be the timer to hang up after
[05:24:28] because I don't want to stay too long
[05:24:29] because I have to
[05:24:31] [ __ ] work on the video so
[05:24:34] I will call him
[05:24:37] hello
[05:24:39] are you ready
[05:24:44] I'm causing this team like you can I
[05:24:47] just think if you're playing close range
[05:24:49] for power NATO and you don't have C1
[05:24:51] there's a chance you want a shield
[05:24:52] because it's you have to be close
[05:24:54] because the fire NATO so you can't kite
[05:24:56] enemies so your charge tax can get
[05:24:58] interrupted so I think you want a shield
[05:24:59] here but kozlova would be better yeah
[05:25:02] maybe with C1 if you have to see one
[05:25:04] probably but without it it might be hard
[05:25:08] maybe I'm just skill issue though
[05:25:12] maybe Chatters are better than me
[05:25:24] what the [ __ ] is that
[05:25:26] oh it's too fast I mean no fast not
[05:25:29] wrongly let's do this
[05:25:34] hello hello
[05:25:37] what's up wait I turned you two up speak
[05:25:44] speak
[05:25:48] okay whatever
[05:25:49] your volume is set at this no matter
[05:25:52] what okay is it loud shot or is it not
[05:25:56] loud
[05:25:58] oh wait everybody stand back because if
[05:26:01] it's loud I'm gonna yell and if it's not
[05:26:03] loud
[05:26:07] it's okay well I don't want it to be
[05:26:09] okay it is okay
[05:26:16] wait why does national team actually
[05:26:17] feel good [ __ ] it does it I don't know
[05:26:21] man
[05:26:22] that doesn't matter your name is cope
[05:26:29] what no okay
[05:26:34] Roblox for the signature weapon and is
[05:26:36] wondering why
[05:26:38] the characters all right in the team
[05:26:41] stabilize well yeah it's a team that
[05:26:43] shouldn't feel all right but it's
[05:26:44] changing should feel all right in a
[05:26:46] certainly because it's not his best team
[05:26:48] yeah but Bennett also doesn't buff him
[05:26:50] here
[05:26:51] settle down be Sanctified
[05:26:57] also you don't get you either don't get
[05:27:01] Petron one or you don't get miloth on
[05:27:02] one
[05:27:04] this is like a bit weird are you causa
[05:27:07] but causes like Kaza yeah I don't like
[05:27:10] the other one not teams no because you
[05:27:11] have to be close for power NATO so you
[05:27:12] need to see one
[05:27:14] if you Causeway right
[05:27:16] what the [ __ ] is bro talking about wait
[05:27:19] it's true you have to be close to
[05:27:20] enemies for power NATO so you can't kite
[05:27:22] things which means you're gonna get in
[05:27:23] trouble when you charge shock
[05:27:25] what the [ __ ] does that have to do with
[05:27:27] it C1 gives you resistance attraction
[05:27:28] doesn't it oh
[05:27:34] no way you made fun of me and then
[05:27:36] I was right let this be known chat
[05:27:39] I don't think you're right I think how
[05:27:41] was I wrong
[05:27:47] another test subject
[05:27:49] it's just it's just it's just you know
[05:27:52] one of your one of your many talents you
[05:27:54] manage to be wrong in any situation it's
[05:27:56] really quite impressive wait what's your
[05:27:58] favorite team of them
[05:28:00] probably just taser now I've been I've
[05:28:04] been playing right at night though

[05:28:09] pretty insane with him I feel like
[05:28:11] they're just in the heat on let's say
[05:28:12] right now I don't know what I said
[05:28:15] because you don't need cookies healing
[05:28:16] really right so it's like you might as
[05:28:18] well write in if you ever
[05:28:20] kind of put a level one weapon
[05:28:23] I've been liking taser on hyperbloom
[05:28:26] yeah
[05:28:27] it's fine but it's not as good
[05:28:30] yeah those are also the two I like
[05:28:33] hog
[05:28:35] another test subject what why are you
[05:28:39] playing I don't know I feel like it
[05:28:43] humble
[05:28:49] like obviously they work but this is the
[05:28:52] level one weapon they're okay
[05:28:55] no

[05:34:13] I mean I've really been liking Fab on
[05:34:14] the village too no you haven't yes you
[05:34:18] don't need that much ER
[05:34:20] M that you want that much er no you
[05:34:23] don't yeah
[05:34:26] doesn't need it and then your last
[05:34:28] thought might need it like Beto Causeway
[05:34:30] whatever but like Jung Lee ew French
[05:34:33] dude who needs that much yard
[05:34:38] who doesn't
[05:34:40] say that it helps your beta okay but do
[05:34:43] you know what else do we know [ __ ]
[05:34:44] [ __ ] [ __ ] hakushan ring gohokushin
[05:34:47] ew no okay
[05:34:51] bro what bro is out here recommending
[05:34:54] what's your rotation to Pro
[05:34:55] accomplishing
[05:34:58] were you still getting the right swirls
[05:35:03] I mean tell me
[05:35:05] did you think this through you're doing
[05:35:06] this through what's your rotation the
[05:35:09] need to pass on your team
[05:35:12] why would you don't need five on your
[05:35:14] team five you don't you actually are you
[05:35:16] not playing official
[05:35:19] okay official doesn't need the energy
[05:35:21] doesn't need energy that's two
[05:35:22] characters
[05:35:23] I mean if you're playing solo Electro
[05:35:25] officials he does
[05:35:27] I mean copium
[05:35:30] like I'm playing elegy right so I I
[05:35:32] don't but
[05:35:36] what about navient Mona
[05:35:38] no
[05:35:39] no think about it don't think about it
[05:35:41] no no think about it a little I'm
[05:35:43] thinking about it no oh also okay actual
[05:35:46] question for nebula ah blue Manila you
[05:35:49] that probably do double Dutcher right
[05:35:55] I just don't like double
[05:35:57] I don't like double dender teams that
[05:35:59] don't involve kokomi
[05:36:01] because then blooming feels weird what
[05:36:04] what
[05:36:06] but that's such a [ __ ] take okay well
[05:36:09] Barbara too like I'm saying like I like
[05:36:10] my hydro characters
[05:36:12] I'm saying I like my hydro character to
[05:36:14] be full em is my point what about I know
[05:36:17] you play yeah that's not the point
[05:36:20] huh
[05:36:23] okay whatever fine you you I concede my
[05:36:27] I concede to you I'm just saying my
[05:36:28] point is I don't like dump like two
[05:36:30] dendro too Hydro unless this the hydro
[05:36:32] is the one on full em but I feel like
[05:36:34] you're not going full you're not going
[05:36:35] full em yet
[05:36:37] yeah I don't know I feel like
[05:36:41] it's just it's just it's just nilo being
[05:36:44] nilo like if you if you have key and
[05:36:46] like naida C2 or nilo C2 it doesn't
[05:36:49] matter who you play it'll be fine and if
[05:36:51] you don't it's
[05:36:54] but it's too dendro always better than
[05:36:56] three Hydro here
[05:36:58] taking it probably the mighty be humble
[05:37:03] you're not getting to lose if you're
[05:37:05] three Hydro yeah Hydro you need to
[05:37:08] amplator
[05:37:09] yeah yeah that's true actually
[05:37:13] I forgot about the pre-air I forgot
[05:37:15] about the pre-nahita [ __ ] nilu teams
[05:37:18] are playing that was something
[05:37:24] can you break a rock with maybe let it
[05:37:26] turns black not really you can damage
[05:37:28] wait what did I just claim what domain
[05:37:29] is this oh it's golden oh my God okay
[05:37:31] that's fine it's gonna take a while to
[05:37:33] break them
[05:37:37] oh actually I'm pretty sure that was
[05:37:39] literally zero damage to the rocks
[05:37:43] yep Rock
[05:37:47] chat type yep if you like rocks or love
[05:37:50] [ __ ]
[05:37:52] so Jeff doesn't have a right to call
[05:37:54] anyone's take [ __ ] ever
[05:37:56] damn true
[05:37:59] that's [ __ ]
[05:38:02] true little w
[05:38:04] ow
[05:38:08] I don't think they're joking too I think
[05:38:10] you have a lot of good things but I also
[05:38:12] don't know if you have more good takes
[05:38:13] or bad things I think it averages out
[05:38:16] not bad things that matter like it's not
[05:38:18] like bad meta takes I think it's bad
[05:38:20] like sometimes you'll say something I'll
[05:38:22] be like

[05:39:26] chat either
[05:39:27] like why I don't know oh I see it now I
[05:39:30] see it oh okay it's good
[05:39:34] it's a great amount
[05:39:39] well I also feel like you wanna to eat
[05:39:42] for rotation because it feels awkward if
[05:39:44] not and it feels like you kind of wanna
[05:39:46] not quick swap him but like
[05:39:49] I don't know what it's called like in
[05:39:51] and out of field it's like kind of
[05:39:52] Crystal but it's not cook salt it's like
[05:39:54] split your rotation like two Char shots
[05:39:56] and solve those two charge shocks
[05:39:59] okay cool oh yeah I guess it's just
[05:40:01] quick swap
[05:40:03] but quick stop you don't want to say
[05:40:04] that it's like EQ swap EQ swap but yeah
[05:40:07] it's like a bit more time on field okay
[05:40:08] what do you do after your first four EQ
[05:40:10] swap snake yeah true well you Loki just
[05:40:13] like
[05:40:14] funnel
[05:40:17] funnel
[05:40:20] what did Feng say
[05:40:21] why do you drag Daddy to Vermilion what
[05:40:26] navient actually technically could use
[05:40:28] Vermillion well marriage was just
[05:40:29] Vermillion but with crit but he can
[05:40:31] technically use it because he damages
[05:40:32] himself although it's not during his
[05:40:34] burst but I appreciate it yeah well
[05:40:36] exactly but like he could use it what if
[05:40:38] you play what if you would do a normal
[05:40:40] attack New Village
[05:40:44] foreign
[05:40:49] dude all roads lead to Vermillion I'm
[05:40:51] telling you
[05:40:53] bless them Fontana self-damaging
[05:40:56] mechanics like Xiao like Vermillion I'm
[05:40:58] talking to you not Nick this man has
[05:41:01] never cooked anything other than Ramen
[05:41:03] before and it shows wait I've cooked I
[05:41:06] can cook
[05:41:07] I can cook yeah sure buddy sure
[05:41:10] everybody
[05:41:12] like two days ago it was good
[05:41:16] bullets cause I cook sausages he's a
[05:41:20] chef oh yes I I can cook let me guess it
[05:41:25] was an unrelated homage no cheese is
[05:41:28] overrated omelettes
[05:41:31] actually that's not even true I don't
[05:41:32] even agree with that take
[05:41:34] I just don't put cheese in it it's a
[05:41:36] waste of time
[05:41:42] deserves it I don't deserve it look at
[05:41:45] me chat look at how nice of a Samaritan
[05:41:46] I am you made me wait for five hours
[05:41:52] you were doing other things
[05:41:55] also Island maybe that leveled for like
[05:41:57] one hour
[05:42:01] wait actually didn't I [ __ ] teleport
[05:42:03] to level my weapon and I didn't level my
[05:42:04] weapon XD
[05:42:07] cooking stream soon yeah when are you
[05:42:10] doing a cooking stream huh why would I
[05:42:12] do a cooking stream I can cook though I
[05:42:14] don't trust you I don't believe you
[05:42:16] another shot
[05:42:18] why does the Jeff sound like your suit
[05:42:20] that's racist
[05:42:24] they're both polish
[05:42:26] oh am I
[05:42:29] you could be
[05:42:33] wait what am I making oh yeah
[05:42:35] weapon masks
[05:42:38] oh
[05:42:47] okay but also we agree this character's
[05:42:48] insane right I feel like he's bonkers
[05:42:52] 64 things to consider Bonker these
[05:42:56] bananas
[05:42:57] oh
[05:43:01] he's pretty good
[05:43:03] it feels smooth yeah and like I like
[05:43:06] their range a lot too it feels like you
[05:43:08] know you know who tells Dash and jump
[05:43:11] cancel just feel
[05:43:15] like honestly
[05:43:17] like they feel wrinkly you know
[05:43:20] like as as opposed to smooth they just
[05:43:24] feel rankly you know what I mean no my
[05:43:26] favorite thing is when you dash cancel
[05:43:27] on on hutau C1 after a N1 and then you
[05:43:31] hit the ICD of your dash after two and
[05:43:33] then you can't Dash and you get stomped
[05:43:35] so then you have to do yes that's cool
[05:43:37] yeah I don't know I everything about him
[05:43:39] I like I think it looks cool I think the
[05:43:41] range is huge it hits every [ __ ]
[05:43:43] enemy you want it's easy to kite you
[05:43:45] don't need C1 I don't like I don't like
[05:43:47] his plunge attack I know it's the same
[05:43:49] as every other Catalyst but Catalyst
[05:43:51] sponges just suck
[05:43:54] it makes me feel wet and I don't like it
[05:43:56] yeah callous punches sucked I agree
[05:43:59] like the sound effects make me feel wet
[05:44:02] and I really don't like it
[05:44:04] they also all look the same if they had
[05:44:06] cool animations would be cool but
[05:44:07] they're literally all just a ball
[05:44:12] wait which character is that which
[05:44:14] character had the which new character
[05:44:16] had the [ __ ] Hearthstone Chad message
[05:44:18] effect
[05:44:22] I see
[05:44:25] wait but um
[05:44:29] I forgot
[05:44:34] I just spoke for no reason
[05:44:39] wait what was I thinking of
[05:44:41] bro saying are you having a stroke I
[05:44:45] actually can't think right now my
[05:44:46] presence right
[05:44:54] I like when they put Giant
[05:44:56] hit [ __ ] crafting tables
[05:44:58] the Inazuma was the worst no that's the
[05:45:00] cooking bench
[05:45:03] day one whatever day two
[05:45:07] do you know what I'm referencing
[05:45:09] uh okay I think that's just a scale HP
[05:45:12] exclusive okay
[05:45:14] sorry
[05:45:17] the drinks are good
[05:45:21] [ __ ] I actually don't have enough alien
[05:45:23] life course
[05:45:27] I guess
[05:45:34] uh oh was I thinking [ __ ] I think of
[05:45:37] something
[05:45:38] I'm tired
[05:45:41] wait Nick have you explored any of the
[05:45:42] new mob a bit well not really though boy
[05:45:45] oh wait go go to your mop and show me
[05:45:47] the area I want to see if you have a
[05:45:48] specific Waypoint probably don't I'm
[05:45:50] sick I'm trying to think of something I
[05:45:52] thought of something but I forgot and
[05:45:54] now I'm trying to remember
[05:45:57] Your Shadow command doesn't work it puts
[05:45:59] an exclamation mark at the end of the
[05:46:01] URL
[05:46:02] [ __ ]
[05:46:06] oh you don't have it [ __ ]
[05:46:11] I'll I'll go get it then
[05:46:14] I know [ __ ] it I'm too lazy
[05:46:22] you know what I really like though
[05:46:24] what's up when you're on like two HB you
[05:46:28] can just do charge attack Dodge Charger
[05:46:29] black and you're back to foil
[05:46:33] wait don't you want the you're saying if
[05:46:35] you have the orbs right like that yeah
[05:46:37] yeah no you can just insta heal
[05:46:42] it's bog it's very pog
[05:46:46] also do you think he
[05:46:47] because I didn't get the feeling that he
[05:46:49] really needs a Healer do you also get
[05:46:52] the feeling I the only team where I play
[05:46:54] him with the healer is trailing okay
[05:46:56] yeah but even then I prefer the family
[05:46:59] teams that actually go birds and
[05:47:00] tangling then yeah I agree
[05:47:03] I think I talked about Virgin Daya but
[05:47:05] changing is just better in everywhere
[05:47:07] yeah
[05:47:09] I mean I acknowledge dance shortcomings
[05:47:12] I just wish
[05:47:14] dude if Dale was good gentian would be
[05:47:16] good like imagine the version teams you
[05:47:18] could play
[05:47:22] Madea's kid isn't very good for version
[05:47:24] no but like I yeah but rework her why
[05:47:27] does her burst make her punch who gives
[05:47:28] a [ __ ]
[05:47:31] her birth
[05:47:33] no wait it lasts like two seconds
[05:47:38] four
[05:47:39] yeah four
[05:47:42] oh that's a bit more than that but yeah
[05:47:45] yeah I also think I mean this is just
[05:47:47] vanilla take but why doesn't her e reset
[05:47:50] the [ __ ] duration when you re-slam it
[05:47:52] down
[05:47:55] you wanna
[05:47:57] the pistachio take I don't know the
[05:47:59] opposite of a vanilla take I get it's
[05:48:01] the same as like Fishel but like who
[05:48:03] cares you want my pistachio take what's
[05:48:06] your pistachio take
[05:48:10] I don't think Daya needs a rework I
[05:48:12] think she just needs a buff yeah I think
[05:48:14] it's fine it's really cool just make her
[05:48:16] can you [ __ ] go faster longer that's
[05:48:19] a rework
[05:48:20] I just I'm just saying more numbers I
[05:48:22] can't yeah
[05:48:25] that's cringe though if a character's
[05:48:28] batting just slam scalings on them
[05:48:31] yeah but she's not bad because her kid
[05:48:33] is bad and she's bad because her numbers
[05:48:35] suck
[05:48:36] yeah I mean if her burst in four seconds
[05:48:38] is like really good then sure
[05:48:41] but like that's not I don't know imagine
[05:48:44] okay imagine Society if day of Vape with
[05:48:49] Mona was an actual metal team give it
[05:48:51] imagine Society if every time
[05:48:55] on the stream but like dude sometimes
[05:48:57] the Amigo has her burst and like it's
[05:48:59] good damage but I can't be asked to swap
[05:49:01] in
[05:49:02] e-e-e-q-e-e-e or like [ __ ] I don't know
[05:49:04] so it's like I can't be asked and Dale
[05:49:07] like requires that four seconds
[05:49:09] but
[05:49:10] she would be your only Carrie in the
[05:49:13] team what oh you're saying yeah but
[05:49:16] yeah you're saying a Mona wait you're
[05:49:19] saying where the damage is so high that
[05:49:21] the four seconds of her is enough yeah
[05:49:24] okay but that's like a stupid buff
[05:49:26] that's like
[05:49:28] I mean you just give her C6 that's a
[05:49:30] zero
[05:49:32] uh would you be mad at me if I told you
[05:49:33] I don't know what her C6 does
[05:49:35] I just know it makes her see like c0
[05:49:37] Hotel
[05:49:38] levels do I just know that oh it extends
[05:49:41] it okay that's cool from
[05:49:43] oh yeah no honestly
[05:49:46] honestly six what I think it's kind of
[05:49:49] dumb I don't think it should extend
[05:49:50] duration I think it should just increase
[05:49:52] damage
[05:49:54] it's all front loaded damage and that it
[05:49:56] works well with Mona you just
[05:50:00] like kimono to be [ __ ] useless That's
[05:50:04] it man hey Monica Mona is good if you
[05:50:06] don't have kokomi and hate your life
[05:50:10] well I would like to be good if I like
[05:50:12] my life yeah but we play get your impact
[05:50:17] that's not happening
[05:50:29] my shot is died
[05:50:33] hey no way
[05:50:37] bro died underwater combat dude I got I
[05:50:41] got an entire mining level from Shooting

[05:50:56] don't Nerf it this is literally stupid
[05:50:58] like I don't care just do whatever
[05:51:02] what do we think about him I already
[05:51:05] talked about it is there anything I'm
[05:51:06] not sure of no I'm sure of everything

[05:51:30] that now but even on my own I always
[05:51:32] feel I'm like

[05:51:36] tales and Harbinger usually

[05:52:34] didn't test it
[05:52:35] I assume it works
[05:52:37] I don't think anyone's ever seen
[05:52:44] sorry that was rude that's like it's
[05:52:46] true though
[05:52:47] so [ __ ] tired dude but I have to stay
[05:52:49] up even after this I didn't do my daily
[05:52:51] commissions
[05:52:53] wait why
[05:52:55] I don't know
[05:52:57] why not just sleep
[05:52:59] I want to upload my video or at least
[05:53:01] edit it oh about Annoying me I'll
[05:53:04] probably be out tomorrow anyway so I
[05:53:05] could sleep but
[05:53:07] true true
[05:53:11] using counterpoints wait why is that a
[05:53:14] thing no
[05:53:15] yes oh it's out wait I'm done I did
[05:53:18] three commissions already
[05:53:20] the [ __ ]
[05:53:26] wait four out of four I I did all four
[05:53:28] or should I epitomize my path
[05:53:31] [ __ ]
[05:53:33] epitomized path wait what is that oh you
[05:53:36] know what the catalyst
[05:53:38] I'm not pulling on the weapon batter oh
[05:53:41] I like to do the worst one in the
[05:53:43] banners that I am not going to pull on
[05:53:45] to make sure I don't pull on them
[05:53:48] but which is the worst one
[05:53:51] I mean almost probably better but
[05:53:54] I'm actually gonna play in heavy that oh
[05:53:56] then probably his catalyst
[05:53:58] but you also use fav and you're weird so
[05:54:00] I don't know
[05:54:07] I have charted course
[05:54:09] for the whatever it's called book
[05:54:13] it looks so ugly by the way wait I think
[05:54:16] it looks cool
[05:54:17] what the [ __ ] is that shape
[05:54:20] oh yeah okay it is asymmetrical but it's
[05:54:23] not even asymmetrical it's symmetrical
[05:54:25] it's just ugly no no the base is smaller
[05:54:27] than the top isn't it yeah but when you
[05:54:30] open it oh oh I didn't really look at
[05:54:33] the
[05:54:34] I think it's pretty
[05:54:37] someone said it's a wave
[05:54:40] is it
[05:54:41] well when you open it's a compo no I
[05:54:44] don't know
[05:54:47] in English
[05:54:49] if anything I feel like the only thing
[05:54:50] it's waving is its rights to be called a
[05:54:54] good weapon what
[05:54:57] you know because waving isn't like
[05:54:59] giving up
[05:55:01] dude look at it
[05:55:08] okay
[05:55:10] it actually matches him my favorite is
[05:55:12] the characters that have a signature
[05:55:13] weapon that don't match them
[05:55:24] for you
[05:55:26] foreign

[05:55:42] like it's yeah it's the green donut is
[05:55:44] better yeah Green Donuts actually better
[05:55:47] into the wind chill as you wish me
[05:55:53] is it what you wish to find is it what
[05:55:56] you wish to find of opening a treasure
[05:55:58] chest has at least made it a worthwhile
[05:56:00] experience
[05:56:04] hmm
[05:56:10] I like bite and Blasting though it's
[05:56:13] actually such a banger

[06:01:01] the em in the new lava reaction
[06:01:06] Mossy Rock
[06:01:10] [Music]
[06:01:12] it's actually gonna be good
[06:01:21] the Bell
[06:01:25] you want to know what I think Navia
[06:01:27] should do
[06:01:28] oh no what do you think Navia should be
[06:01:31] actually
[06:01:33] I reserve my right to speak
[06:01:35] why am I not doing Abyss what am I doing
[06:01:37] dude why aren't you answering the
[06:01:39] question
[06:01:41] are they Navia should do Navia things
[06:01:44] and I would thank her for it
[06:01:48] I don't know hopefully she's just
[06:01:53] what if she's Geo but she doesn't do geo
[06:01:55] damage like she infused herself with
[06:01:57] pyro she has a delusion [ __ ] it
[06:02:05] she has a talent if you have two or more
[06:02:08] Geo characters in your team then no no
[06:02:11] [ __ ] if that's weird if you have okay if
[06:02:15] you're using Navia you now unlock new
[06:02:18] Geo reactions
[06:02:21] Joe with
[06:02:22] with Mossy Rock Jill with pyro is lava
[06:02:25] do you know what reactions do what what
[06:02:28] do they do well that I'll let the devs
[06:02:31] decide but example let me just give you
[06:02:32] a teaser Mossy rock it covers that I
[06:02:35] mean Moss so the enemies move slower but
[06:02:38] they also take ticking damage every
[06:02:40] second based on your yam
[06:02:42] so it's just burning close freeze
[06:02:45] burning but it also leaves the aura of
[06:02:48] dendro and Geo constantly I feel like
[06:02:50] burning yeah but burning eats it
[06:02:54] it doesn't need extra charge
[06:02:56] electric is good
[06:03:01] okay and you can swirl them both so you
[06:03:04] can then swap into your Causeway windy
[06:03:06] plant and also windy rock store both of
[06:03:08] them and for this vendor that is gonna
[06:03:10] work
[06:03:18] great ideas for a Ramen Cooker no no
[06:03:21] Navia is coming out no she's gonna be
[06:03:23] like that
[06:03:24] okay
[06:03:25] wait what is your take
[06:03:30] I think she should do something with
[06:03:31] constructs
[06:03:34] then just like try to make constructs
[06:03:36] work
[06:03:37] and then
[06:03:38] like the only like
[06:03:41] construct interaction
[06:03:44] [Music]
[06:03:46] it's it's [ __ ]
[06:03:48] 25.6 percent damage yeah it's [ __ ]
[06:03:51] garbage wait imagine if it was good
[06:03:57] he's actually playing around concerts
[06:04:00] my favorite part is when I'm playing
[06:04:02] Co-op and then the [ __ ] I'm playing
[06:04:04] with sorry not to be toxic but the
[06:04:06] [ __ ] I'm playing with is playing gomc
[06:04:09] and then I have to live with that
[06:04:12] settle down
[06:04:14] I'm sorry that sucks
[06:04:19] yes
[06:04:28] what
[06:04:36] is that like
[06:04:38] what oh her friend the the the the one
[06:04:42] of the the in the black suit right
[06:04:44] the the it's there's the old one and
[06:04:46] then there's silver okay he's the old
[06:04:48] one right okay okay
[06:04:52] can we summon silver instead you forgot
[06:04:54] the box I don't remember names I'm
[06:04:56] watching jjk right now I don't know what
[06:04:57] the main character is called I don't
[06:04:58] remember names I don't give a [ __ ]
[06:04:59] they're not worth yeah wait why can't we
[06:05:03] summon silver
[06:05:07] easy
[06:05:10] imagine having a Shonen and not naming
[06:05:13] it after your main character you think
[06:05:16] Sheldon fans have enough brain power to
[06:05:17] be able to remember names whoa
[06:05:22] sorry why do you think they call them
[06:05:24] boruto they thought it would be too hard
[06:05:27] to call it Mike
[06:05:30] whoa
[06:05:36] thank you
[06:05:38] I'm sure I hate that main character like
[06:05:41] 90 of shows I watch
[06:05:43] why do you watch them then because the
[06:05:45] other characters are sick I didn't like
[06:05:46] gone until the one episode no spoilers
[06:05:48] but then I was like okay God's kind of
[06:05:50] cool
[06:05:51] they're always dumb
[06:05:53] I think I trend is getting more
[06:05:55] prevalent since [ __ ] hero Academia
[06:05:57] but it's always like I I weak but loving
[06:06:00] that's always it it's like maybe [ __ ]
[06:06:03] that has a big heart I tell you to watch
[06:06:06] what else is good dude you know I tell
[06:06:08] people that are like their whole career
[06:06:10] is like anime stuff and I'll tell them
[06:06:12] when I was like I haven't watched it
[06:06:13] it's actually so low-key like no one
[06:06:15] knows it
[06:06:18] one day okay one day they'll adopt the
[06:06:21] second [ __ ] part I haven't even
[06:06:23] finished it I'm like I don't even know
[06:06:25] where I left off I was like I'm like
[06:06:26] near the end I don't know why I didn't
[06:06:27] finish it Oh you mean the manga oh
[06:06:30] yes
[06:06:35] okay fair you look like you like kiloa
[06:06:38] that is so accurate okay I'm actually
[06:06:42] dude you like I think he's family more
[06:06:45] than him I like his family more I like
[06:06:46] his family more I think the Assassins
[06:06:48] are cool he's kind of what I mean he's
[06:06:49] like
[06:06:52] knowing who your favorite character in
[06:06:54] Hunter Hunter is I don't think you ever
[06:06:55] have a right to speak online
[06:06:58] in in characters like that's all I'm
[06:07:01] saying okay okay listen
[06:07:04] that's all I'm
[06:07:07] sure the villains are cooler but kilo is
[06:07:09] fine too kilo is fine too
[06:07:12] that's all I'm saying
[06:07:14] dude
[06:07:16] also this guy only said it because uh
[06:07:19] what's his name because tens has a
[06:07:20] hisoka profile picture
[06:07:22] or not hisoka leoria who's this promo
[06:07:25] picture kilowatt is this killer yeah oh
[06:07:27] I like faithan I forgot Phaeton existed
[06:07:29] is that guy NPC though I think he just
[06:07:31] looks cool
[06:07:34] what does he actually do in the show I
[06:07:36] don't remember
[06:07:38] I think he's cool but does he actually
[06:07:40] do anything
[06:07:43] jjk Tokyo Revengers boruto all the same
[06:07:46] they're not the same jjk looks kind of
[06:07:49] cool
[06:07:50] Revengers makes you want to throw up
[06:07:52] whenever you actually think about it for
[06:07:54] more than a half a second
[06:07:56] and literally no one's ever watched
[06:07:58] boruto
[06:07:59] so like
[06:08:01] oh wait wait wait wait wait I got I got
[06:08:04] I'm too tired to think right now I have
[06:08:06] an overall checkout called nethero
[06:08:07] that's my favorite character I forgot
[06:08:09] nether is my favorite
[06:08:11] I forgot I forgot about him
[06:08:14] that is the goat
[06:08:18] he [ __ ] drove the plane more So Gone
[06:08:20] could sleep
[06:08:24] I forgot boruto existed that's a good
[06:08:27] thing don't worry
[06:08:29] okay
[06:08:30] standard today sorry should I watch it
[06:08:34] I I haven't gotten far into boruto
[06:08:37] because it was too boring but like the
[06:08:39] beginning of boruto is very bad
[06:08:43] it's you know you know how like
[06:08:46] Disney does live action movies and they
[06:08:49] suck very often because it's just a an
[06:08:52] attempt at like capitalizing on a
[06:08:54] pre-existing franchise and just make
[06:08:56] money and there's no passion behind it
[06:08:58] and it just sucks yes that's boruto at
[06:09:01] least for the beginning I'm sure it
[06:09:02] maybe gets better after but like holy
[06:09:05] [ __ ] it's yeah
[06:09:08] first I was good if you skip it doesn't
[06:09:10] have a soul
[06:09:12] okay I'm [ __ ] falling asleep I gotta
[06:09:14] go
[06:09:17] I can it's almost a good take
[06:09:20] yeah
[06:09:22] I don't watch anything
[06:09:25] I appreciate you
[06:09:27] anything you want to say
[06:09:30] how do you feel about Nevis rate them up
[06:09:32] from six to four
[06:09:35] based on what
[06:09:37] his gameplay
[06:09:42] six
[06:09:43] all right it's good that's good
[06:09:46] is it I don't know I said six to four I
[06:09:49] don't I don't have a frame of reference
[06:09:51] for I think he's great I actually eat
[06:09:53] really for [ __ ] like him and I think
[06:09:55] he's strong I think he's in I actually
[06:09:56] think he's like low-key busted not like
[06:10:00] meta breaking but like really good
[06:10:04] I like that he can bite and blast I also
[06:10:07] like that
[06:10:11] okay I'm falling asleep thanks goodbye
[06:10:17] yeah I'm [ __ ] falling asleep also I
[06:10:22] I'm like in my head I'm like thinking of
[06:10:24] like if there's anything I need to
[06:10:26] change in my video before I upload it
[06:10:31] I also don't know any of the animes he's
[06:10:32] talking about
[06:10:36] um yeah I mean overall I think it's
[06:10:37] [ __ ] insane I actually really think
[06:10:39] it's good
[06:10:41] so
[06:10:46] Attalla was really low there too it says
[06:10:48] well it's not that low actually
[06:11:01] signature yeah
[06:11:06] c0r1 relatively respectable
[06:11:10] relatively respectful there's also a lot
[06:11:12] of room for optimization like this could
[06:11:13] be level this could be leveled he could
[06:11:15] be level because he scales on HP also
[06:11:17] crit damage Ascension uh and our
[06:11:20] artifacts could be better
[06:11:22] like this piece is like it's it's like
[06:11:24] not bad but like a lot of these pieces
[06:11:26] are like well our goblet's insane but
[06:11:28] all of them are like decently good
[06:11:34] is our flower good our flower's pretty
[06:11:36] good
[06:11:38] I guess I could go marker damage because
[06:11:40] I don't need that much crit rate with
[06:11:41] this set but
[06:11:45] plus 63 def Keck w
[06:11:49] ow wait which piece had 63 def
[06:11:51] okay [ __ ] off dude it's not even funny
[06:11:54] your standard is too high yeah but like
[06:11:56] look at how many artifacts I have it has
[06:11:58] to be right like these are all plus 20.
[06:12:00] everything you just saw plus 20. so like
[06:12:02] I can't not have yeah I can't be this
[06:12:04] late into the game and be happy with
[06:12:06] just main stats but like obviously
[06:12:07] depending on where you are in the game
[06:12:09] like your standards should be different
[06:12:10] so don't worry if your artifacts aren't
[06:12:12] that good right it's okay
[06:12:27] what's your ratio
[06:12:29] this but it's also inflated with the
[06:12:31] weapon without it well our weapon gives
[06:12:34] us so if we're level 90 we get eight
[06:12:36] percent here and then more from
[06:12:38] ascending eight percent plus that looks
[06:12:40] like nine percent ish
[06:12:43] so yeah we'll get some more but without
[06:12:44] it it would be like uh
[06:12:46] that
[06:12:48] but we have we're like we actually have
[06:12:51] more than that effectively because
[06:12:54] uh we get 36 crit from Mario say so
[06:12:59] yeah that's why our ratio is like that
[06:13:07] we've watched the one before HSR live
[06:13:08] stream I'll try to but I'm not sure yet
[06:13:11] is the weapon worth it yes but it
[06:13:13] depends what you have if you have
[06:13:13] sacrificial Jade you're trying to refine
[06:13:15] it maybe not prototype Amber is good but
[06:13:17] it's like a 30 to 40 DPS increase which
[06:13:20] is a lot for a signature it's pretty
[06:13:21] [ __ ] good
[06:13:44] yeah like this weapon ranking shows our
[06:13:46] weapon ranking shows Amber so right of
[06:13:49] the turtle floor is 144
[06:13:51] compared to the 100 of prototype Amber
[06:13:55] R5 I need to make sure this is accurate
[06:13:57] but like that's insane I thought it was
[06:13:59] less than that is it actually that much
[06:14:05] I want to make sure that's accurate but
[06:14:08] the other way ones I've seen that put at
[06:14:09] least 30 so I know it's a lot
[06:14:17] can you show it I don't want to show it
[06:14:18] until it's uploaded just in case there's
[06:14:19] something different Navia means calc 38
[06:14:21] yeah then 44 is probably accurate
[06:14:23] because we also calc uh
[06:14:26] I know we added uh like
[06:14:30] there's a certain Assumption of how much
[06:14:32] energy you're saving and how much you
[06:14:34] need our ER requirements are a bit on
[06:14:37] the higher end
[06:14:38] our assumption is 140 which is a bit on
[06:14:40] the higher end
[06:14:41] uh and then you reinvest that into HP or
[06:14:44] crit so it like depends on how you count
[06:14:46] that damn
[06:14:50] all right thanks for watching we're
[06:14:52] going to raise the sa7 we're calling
[06:14:54] them be nice to him
[06:14:57] how much HP would you like to have oh
[06:14:58] there's no specific amount you're
[06:15:00] looking for
[06:15:01] uh obviously like
[06:15:03] the more the merrier but crit is usually
[06:15:05] the best thought to invest into so it's
[06:15:07] like there's no like set number you're
[06:15:09] looking for right but you want an HP
[06:15:12] sense and then after that
[06:15:14] um Hydro goblet crit circulate but HP
[06:15:16] circulate is viable as well if you start
[06:15:17] reaching really high crit investment
[06:15:20] because you have a critical weapon crit
[06:15:21] Ascension then uh HP circular becomes
[06:15:25] similar to crit and at that point you
[06:15:27] could be like okay I'll go if you Circle
[06:15:28] instead or crit depending on your sub
[06:15:30] stats and stuff uh but it's never like a
[06:15:33] set amount of HP you're looking for
[06:15:39] like with most characters like that are
[06:15:41] scaling on uh HP attack
[06:15:51] I had fun today we did a lot six hour
[06:15:54] stream damn
[06:16:00] oh it's all coming out now
[06:16:04] [Music]
[06:16:08] sorry thanks for watching guys I love
[06:16:10] you guys all modern yet is [ __ ] sick
[06:16:13] one of my favorite characters I'm gonna
[06:16:15] stream again really soon by the way a
[06:16:16] day or two I really want to play them
[06:16:17] again because I think he's [ __ ]
