[00:05:11] that was showering too like sometimes
[00:05:12] it's like you're on a roll and like you
[00:05:14] keep rolling good artifacts then you
[00:05:16] shower and then you just get defense so
[00:05:18] like when I get crit I can't shower

[00:05:51] neither do you so how do you do
[00:05:55] welcome
[00:05:56] to probably the shortest log stream ever
[00:06:00] I'm incapable of short streams because
[00:06:02] I'm tall I'm a tall man I literally
[00:06:04] can't do short streams but I don't have
[00:06:06] a choice
[00:06:09] so this stream has to be like two hours
[00:06:11] so welcome
[00:06:21] um okay here's our here's what's
[00:06:23] happening so
[00:06:24] I
[00:06:27] okay
[00:06:31] okay
[00:06:33] here here's what we're doing okay at
[00:06:36] some point this week we're gonna do an
[00:06:37] account review stream we have to do the
[00:06:39] second part of the 5000 resin in the new
[00:06:41] domain stream and we have to do the
[00:06:42] archon quest which is gonna be made out
[00:06:44] of it but [ __ ] you I'm gonna pretend
[00:06:45] it's not those are the three big streams
[00:06:47] I want to do this week and or next week
[00:06:49] but for a few days
[00:06:54] since the gentian there's like the
[00:06:55] gentian Fontan tour thing in New York
[00:06:57] and I need to help Fang move somewhere
[00:06:59] so I might well I'm not I might at 6 30
[00:07:03] in the morning I have a flight so I have
[00:07:05] to leave my house in like three hours
[00:07:06] two but it's fine I'm streaming until
[00:07:09] then it doesn't matter I don't need to
[00:07:10] pack so we're streaming then I'll do
[00:07:12] I'll be gone for like a few days but
[00:07:13] over there I'll do a account review
[00:07:14] Stream So then that's one of the three
[00:07:16] things knocked out then I'll be back and
[00:07:17] then I'll do the resin and I'll do the
[00:07:19] archon quest and then boom boom and then
[00:07:21] we have a bunch of content so expect all
[00:07:23] of those streams tell your friends tell
[00:07:25] your mom mom socks is gonna do the
[00:07:27] archon quest he's gonna review accounts
[00:07:29] mom mom she's he's gonna he's gonna he's
[00:07:32] gonna spend resin in Guild the golden
[00:07:34] Troop
[00:07:36] anyways so that's all happening uh but
[00:07:38] as it says right now I have to be out of
[00:07:40] my house in like three hours
[00:07:42] um
[00:07:44] yeah so
[00:07:47] um we're gonna do a quick stream the
[00:07:48] reason why this stream is so late is
[00:07:49] because I I edited it will help finished
[00:07:52] editing and reviewed the Lynette video
[00:07:54] it's out smash Mark of the net pretty
[00:07:56] good then I recorded the whole official
[00:07:58] guide except teams because you can use
[00:08:00] it on any [ __ ] team and I don't feel
[00:08:01] like doing that yet sold it on a bit and
[00:08:03] weapons because weapons are also weird
[00:08:07] um I'll probably throws the Jeff in the
[00:08:09] math dungeon to do weapon Arrowhead
[00:08:10] ranking but weapons is not hard like
[00:08:13] it's [ __ ] Polar Star or any five star
[00:08:15] or stringless or Ali Hunter like it's
[00:08:17] not hard but like explaining it in more
[00:08:19] detail than that is [ __ ] annoying so
[00:08:20] I'll do it later
[00:08:22] um
[00:08:24] yeah
[00:08:25] this weapon's also okay
[00:08:30] but uh stringless is [ __ ] cracked
[00:08:34] anyways so that is my plan now I don't
[00:08:37] have time to
[00:08:39] waste so we're going to do the wordles
[00:08:42] against and then we're gonna grind
[00:08:43] artifacts we have to do this fast let me
[00:08:46] already put a playlist on let me already
[00:08:47] put a let me let me let me put a
[00:08:50] playlist on
[00:08:52] sure okay listen listen listen listen

[00:18:57] no I don't know if you saw what they say
[00:18:59] hey man's tortellini enjoy this is 21
[00:19:00] retro this is a 10.
[00:19:03] I'm more of a I'm more of a the other
[00:19:05] girl enjoyer whatever her name is
[00:19:07] chlorine
[00:19:09] how do you stare
[00:19:12] or nine or like
[00:19:14] and
[00:19:14] but like that sounds I don't know it
[00:19:16] doesn't even sound like a real name
[00:19:18] no no disrespect if your name is
[00:19:20] chlorine no disrespect but I'm just
[00:19:21] saying
[00:19:22] like I know how to say it in French it
[00:19:24] just doesn't sound like how I'm supposed
[00:19:25] to say it
[00:19:27] as kameos [ __ ] I speak French I
[00:19:31] just that doesn't sound like how you're
[00:19:32] supposed to say it
[00:19:48] you'll switch up once you play the quest
[00:19:51] oh
[00:19:55] both of you to think I'm gonna choose
[00:19:57] personality in in gadget impact
[00:20:06] a round of applause
[00:20:18] you chose ciao only for his looks then
[00:20:20] question mark no but okay okay no but I
[00:20:26] literally knew I liked Xiao before I
[00:20:27] started playing catch an impact
[00:20:38] is Hydra MC better than dead drum C oh
[00:20:40] yeah okay so Hydra MC okay a good
[00:20:43] question actually so if you're okay
[00:20:45] let's say hypothetically okay let's say
[00:20:48] you're playing you have to choose either
[00:20:51] Hydro MC or dandrumsy right and the
[00:20:53] enemy you're fighting is immune to
[00:20:55] denture damage but also not just that
[00:20:57] you also can't use dendro on it to apply
[00:20:59] like Quicken or anything uh and also
[00:21:03] when you do high it has negative Hydro
[00:21:05] resistance and also you don't have
[00:21:06] Synchro Mona yellon child ayato kokomi
[00:21:09] Barbara uh uh uh uh uh uh
[00:21:13] uh uh uh uh uh is there any other Hydro
[00:21:15] character
[00:21:18] I mean
[00:21:22] yeah on your account then well neither
[00:21:24] doesn't really count then uh uh uh
[00:21:26] hydrants would be better than drumsy if
[00:21:29] not just use energy
[00:21:35] good
[00:21:38] all right [ __ ] my commissions let's just
[00:21:40] spin resin do you know what sleep is if

[00:55:57] foreign
[00:56:07] it's okay
[00:56:09] what's the third bow heart harp is
[00:56:11] really good well like for like a
[00:56:13] standard Banner weapon it's really good
[00:56:15] like The Limited ones are usually a bit
[00:56:16] better but still it's a lot of stats
[00:56:18] High base attack
[00:56:20] all right domain
[00:56:29] there are only two bows you said three

[00:57:15] good okay Scarlet's spine would be good
[00:57:18] if bevonious Lance didn't exist so the
[00:57:20] more fivonius lances you have the worse
[00:57:22] Skyward spine is but it's okay it's like
[00:57:24] about as good as catch on Ryden I'm
[00:57:27] pretty sure unless that myth got
[00:57:29] debunked but uh it's been a while since
[00:57:31] I've done riding calcs but yeah or like
[00:57:33] since I've
[00:57:35] survives the drift
[00:57:37] but yeah it's fine this guy's fine is
[00:57:39] fine
[00:57:42] like it's good enough to use if you have
[00:57:44] it but it's not something you like
[00:57:46] want because there's usually good other
[00:57:48] like four star options there's like five
[00:57:49] there's catch there's even like battle
[00:57:52] pass ones if you get Battle pass fears
[00:57:55] there's a lot of good pull arms
[00:57:57] but it's not bad
[00:58:04] all right watch this watch this watch

[00:59:08] Coco yo
[00:59:10] I was going to bed at all but not worth
[00:59:16] no what the [ __ ]
[00:59:22] cool
[00:59:24] yo Mr zionics is a five gifted
[00:59:27] appreciate it
[00:59:29] look at you
[00:59:32] should I roll for yolan to replace my
[00:59:33] support singtro no no no no no unless
[00:59:37] you just unless you're like a waifu
[00:59:39] collector no
[00:59:41] that doesn't mean you shouldn't pull for
[00:59:42] your lawn that's not what I'm saying but
[00:59:43] don't replace each other either use her
[00:59:46] alongside him or in another team
[00:59:51] um but if you're just like if you hate
[00:59:52] Synchro and you want to use someone else
[00:59:53] and yeah you can use it
[01:00:04] in order to bencho is about as good
[01:00:08] meta-wise as pulling for Dory
[01:00:10] no let me rephrase that pulling on a
[01:00:12] Daya Banner
[01:00:22] I was also I'm also uh
[01:00:28] look before before retroversion became
[01:00:30] the meta defining deluke team
[01:00:34] I uh I was seeking for oh
[01:00:38] wait this could be good double crit
[01:00:43] okay first gets so good
[01:00:48] first good circulate
[01:00:54] wait chat
[01:01:01] so we're doing I'm doing a 5 000 resin
[01:01:03] in this domain video which is gonna be
[01:01:04] in two streams this is like a middle
[01:01:06] stream between the two are we gonna use
[01:01:08] this I don't know the I mean sure I
[01:01:10] guess whatever I'll save up if this
[01:01:12] rolls good I'll time stamp it if it
[01:01:13] rolls bad then uh we'll pretend it never
[01:01:16] happened it's fine
[01:01:23] [ __ ] it I'll roll it now anyways as I
[01:01:25] was saying
[01:01:27] okay anyways as I was saying
[01:01:34] um
[01:01:36] before retroversion became the meta
[01:01:38] defining the Luke team which it isn't
[01:01:40] but it is copium
[01:01:42] I was hoping for some variants in the
[01:01:44] Luke supports and yolan kind of gives
[01:01:45] that so that's cool
[01:01:47] but usually you just play them together
[01:01:52] [ __ ] why does it do that
[01:01:55] okay I I see beer
[01:02:07] okay okay okay
[01:02:09] I mean it's not attack percent but if we
[01:02:12] get criterate and er rolls then this
[01:02:14] could be a good piece like nine percent
[01:02:16] crit rate or more it's good you don't
[01:02:18] need that much especially on a new set
[01:02:19] you don't have to have the highest
[01:02:22] standards it's like it's one step at a
[01:02:24] time you can't become you can't you have
[01:02:27] to
[01:02:28] wait what did I I wrote the HP dude I've
[01:02:30] been playing too much star rail I
[01:02:32] thought I got a new stat at nine instead
[01:02:33] of eight
[01:02:36] I literally I've
[01:02:38] I've been I've been playing too much
[01:02:39] story on my match my bad
[01:02:49] well
[01:02:50] it's fine it's fine
[01:02:58] we'll roll our crew right here it'll be
[01:03:00] fine
[01:03:01] two more extraordinary rules that's nine
[01:03:03] percent crit rate that's actually not
[01:03:04] bad like two even if we got a bunch of
[01:03:06] HP two more curry rolls yeah one more we
[01:03:08] got nine is actually fine so don't worry
[01:03:10] this piece will be good I think
[01:03:14] I'm not even kidding by the way this is
[01:03:15] actually gonna be a good piece we just
[01:03:16] roll criterate one more time it's good
[01:03:18] okay well it's still technically our
[01:03:20] best so I'm Gonna Keep it I'll unlock it
[01:03:23] but we'll keep it dude it's still our
[01:03:25] best it's actually our best it's fine
[01:03:27] it's fine it's fine
[01:03:31] wasted XP yeah it definitely is but
[01:03:33] whatever

[01:05:45] uh because you're asking that I want to
[01:05:47] say no if you like Lenny then yes but
[01:05:50] the fact that you're asking that means
[01:05:52] that you don't want him but you feel
[01:05:53] pressured to pull for him and then
[01:05:55] you're gonna regret it when everyone's
[01:05:56] saying the same [ __ ] about Karina and
[01:05:57] naviette and Risley and [ __ ] chlorine
[01:06:00] and [ __ ] Taylor Swift and [ __ ]

[01:06:44] show a complete Lenny guide with a
[01:06:47] detailed web ranking featuring The Jeff
[01:06:49] 77's match to show me exactly how good

[01:07:27] there's like four free to play weapons
[01:07:29] here there's a song of Stillness and
[01:07:31] there's black Cliff you definitely have
[01:07:34] some weapons here
[01:07:36] even black Cliff is free to play
[01:07:37] technically
[01:07:41] too
[01:07:48] what is song of still is it's new it
[01:07:50] just came out it's the new
[01:07:52] um blacksmith fontanon
[01:08:06] wait actually let me go to the where is
[01:08:08] the box he's over here right or she
[01:08:19] foreign
[01:08:26] I just got a call and Vermillion is
[01:08:28] asking for you
[01:08:33] there's probably 32 when refined right
[01:08:35] it's kind of pog
[01:08:39] like a Vermillion is not asking for me
[01:08:41] but thanks 100 bits
[01:08:47] wait okay do you guys think
[01:08:50] charge shot with prototype Crescent to
[01:08:52] hit a weak point like quick swell
[01:08:53] because there's not this is this like
[01:08:55] has to be better
[01:08:59] like unless you're like procking
[01:09:01] creston's passive this has to be better
[01:09:03] but if you are then maybe not
[01:09:12] materials insufficient materials
[01:09:14] insufficient materials
[01:09:17] what the [ __ ] is that
[01:09:26] oh yeah official oh yeah official heals
[01:09:29] herself too wait that's true
[01:09:32] wait when does okay
[01:09:35] okay actually question question
[01:09:39] okay so so you know how official
[01:09:41] snapshots are all snapshots right okay
[01:09:42] okay okay all snapshots and every time
[01:09:44] you read something odds and re-snap
[01:09:45] shots okay so here's my question
[01:09:49] the order of of of of of of of of of of
[01:09:52] of of official burst at C4
[01:09:58] do you heal and then summon Oz because
[01:10:00] if yes then it snapshots if not you have
[01:10:02] to re-summon like wait let me see
[01:10:05] if you have to see where you probably
[01:10:06] have a better weapon I mean Maybe
[01:10:14] what's special
[01:10:18] let's see diver burst I do okay let's
[01:10:20] see if we heal or someone else first I
[01:10:22] mean I should probably test this against
[01:10:23] an enemy to see if it actually does
[01:10:25] anything but
[01:10:28] okay ah
[01:10:30] we'd have to test against an enemy
[01:10:33] yeah we'd have to test it Saj
[01:10:38] AK
[01:10:40] it looked like it summoned the bird and
[01:10:43] then like it it looked like Oz probably
[01:10:45] would not have gotten buffed yeah
[01:10:48] so you'd have to re-summon you'd have to
[01:10:50] queue and then and then re-summon
[01:11:03] all right let me go craft some more
[01:11:05] resin
[01:11:12] is there me about better official than
[01:11:13] R5 stringless it should be worse than
[01:11:15] aggravate and better without aggravate
[01:11:16] but there will be a weapon ranking for
[01:11:18] any official video
[01:11:19] every five star Bowens official is a
[01:11:21] good stat stick stringless is just
[01:11:23] stringless is good but then it becomes
[01:11:25] insane when you're aggravating when you
[01:11:27] aggravate R5 stringless is about as good
[01:11:30] as your like best five stars it's
[01:11:31] usually a bit worse like Polar Star Aqua
[01:11:32] or like a little bit better but not
[01:11:35] always because it gives you yeah which
[01:11:37] is useful and then uh Buffs your skill
[01:11:38] damage
[01:11:42] slot though
[01:11:48] okay
[01:11:50] um okay I'm not gonna do any more
[01:11:51] refreshes but we could use fragile I was
[01:11:53] thinking of saving a fragile for the
[01:11:54] next stream so I don't think
[01:11:59] chat wasn't convincing were you guys
[01:12:00] convinced were you guys convinced I
[01:12:01] wasn't gonna
[01:12:02] were you guys convinced yes or no were
[01:12:03] you guys convinced yes or no yes or no

[01:12:29] something I don't huh
[01:12:34] that is curious

[01:12:39] valuable to your account but uh a lot of
[01:12:41] people like writing and writing's pretty
[01:12:43] good so I guess it's up to you it's
[01:12:45] constant healing matches Lenny's kit
[01:12:48] what's up can I ask if Lenny invite you
[01:12:50] go well together uh okay baiju's healing
[01:12:53] can help you get more marriage Jose
[01:12:55] consistency but baidu's shielding is not
[01:12:59] a shield true uh so not really it's not
[01:13:02] you like you can you can run by Drew but
[01:13:05] you it's like the shield literally tanks
[01:13:07] one hit
[01:13:09] that's it
[01:13:21] foreign
[01:13:55] okay well it is Showtime is Tomah good
[01:13:58] for Lenny uh okay I literally answered
[01:14:00] all this my guide just go watch it but
[01:14:03] he's fine you just have to normal attack
[01:14:06] Lenny doesn't want a normal attack so
[01:14:07] it's like you'd have to do this like I
[01:14:10] don't know if you want to do that
[01:14:12] if you do then it's fine
[01:14:17] crazy
[01:14:24] can I use Amos on your lawn
[01:14:29] I can't
[01:14:36] I actually feel bad I feel bad for
[01:14:39] anyone who pulled on this weapon batter
[01:14:40] and got Amos they're like dude I can't
[01:14:42] wait to get a good bow there's no losing
[01:14:44] and then they got Amos
[01:14:46] touch
[01:14:47] it's actually a tragedy
[01:14:52] that was on a shot Nice Shot Nice Shot
[01:14:53] can you type nice shot and chat and I
[01:14:54] shot
[01:14:55] I just didn't send that to the Jeff
[01:15:06] could be good this uh no not really
[01:15:12] crit damage is a lot better on the
[01:15:13] southern crit rate
[01:15:29] gone you or stupid line okay that sounds
[01:15:32] like a biased question that sounds like
[01:15:34] you're trying to influence my answer
[01:15:39] foreign
[01:15:45] okay I think I get this question so much
[01:15:47] we have to make this into like a short
[01:15:53] I need to make an exclamation mark
[01:15:55] snapshotting command
[01:15:57] turn this into the [ __ ] YouTube short
[01:15:58] one second let me include this domain
[01:16:13] what's a good example other than
[01:16:15] McDonald's I think McDonald's is the
[01:16:17] best example
[01:16:32] okay okay
[01:16:35] I actually have a good analogy I have a
[01:16:36] good analogy I actually have a good
[01:16:37] analogy I'll get analogy
[01:16:40] okay
[01:16:45] this could be good if yaimiko is Pyro
[01:16:49] yeah
[01:16:51] okay
[01:16:52] for everyone asking what is snapshotting
[01:16:54] I'll answer it now and we can make this
[01:16:55] into a command so it's answered once and
[01:16:57] for all okay
[01:16:58] here's what snapshotting is let's say
[01:17:00] there's a new law that passes where if
[01:17:04] you're you're the companies that
[01:17:05] manufacturers of chip bags now have to
[01:17:08] have 90 chips and no more air than 10 of
[01:17:11] the bag or they get thrown in jail but
[01:17:14] they already are selling a bunch of
[01:17:16] chips it's probably about millions of
[01:17:18] bags being sold before the law even
[01:17:21] passed so what are they gonna do if the
[01:17:23] law snapshots then
[01:17:26] okay let's say it doesn't stop if the
[01:17:28] law doesn't snapshot they would have to
[01:17:30] recall all the bags or go collect them
[01:17:32] because if any of them had air in them
[01:17:34] they'd go to jail but if they lost
[01:17:35] snapshots that means that that means
[01:17:38] that it at the time of making the bag
[01:17:40] you factor in the laws that are already
[01:17:42] in place and not the new ones so it
[01:17:44] where you wouldn't go to jail actually
[01:17:45] so that's how it works okay that was bad
[01:17:48] let's do a better one okay okay okay
[01:17:50] okay okay this is what snapshotting is
[01:17:52] let's say
[01:17:54] McDonald's okay and it's 9 59 a.m and
[01:17:57] breakfast ends at 10 am
[01:17:59] and it's 959 you say hey Chef can I have
[01:18:03] a mick
[01:18:04] what's the brexit uh egg McMuffin and
[01:18:07] they say sure thing and then they cook
[01:18:09] you that Big muffin and then it takes 10
[01:18:10] minutes to cook you get it at 10.09. if
[01:18:14] breakfast if it's snapshotted you'll get
[01:18:17] your breakfast if it didn't if the
[01:18:19] McDonald's all-day breakfast doesn't
[01:18:21] snapshot then at 10 he would stop
[01:18:23] cooking he'd say [ __ ] you [ __ ] your
[01:18:26] family I'm not making the sandwich for
[01:18:28] you it's no it's past ten I don't cook
[01:18:30] breakfast but if it did if your order
[01:18:32] did snapshot then you would still make
[01:18:34] it for you and you'd enjoy your
[01:18:35] breakfast at 11 or 10 or 10 am
[01:18:41] you're welcome
[01:18:44] your order if you're ordering snapshots
[01:18:46] you still get your breakfast order even
[01:18:49] if it's past
[01:18:50] your order if your order did not
[01:18:52] snapshot then even if you order at 9.50
[01:18:55] and then the chef is slow it turns ten
[01:18:57] dingo he says [ __ ] you he's he throws it
[01:19:00] in the trash and gives you something
[01:19:01] else
[01:19:10] okay we need to make that a clip now
[01:19:17] thank God you're not a teacher dude it
[01:19:19] literally makes sense it literally makes
[01:19:21] sense
[01:19:25] okay let me give you an example let me
[01:19:26] give you an example okay sync troll is
[01:19:29] like man
[01:19:30] I don't give a [ __ ] about you I have
[01:19:32] books to read as soon as that's 11 I'm
[01:19:34] out as soon as it's 10 a.m I'm out
[01:19:37] kazua he's loving he's caring okay
[01:19:40] so Bennett uses his burst Bennett Ben is
[01:19:43] burst think of it as a McDonald's order
[01:19:44] he throws his order out poke in the
[01:19:46] bokin
[01:19:48] okay then Causeway uses his burst and
[01:19:51] sing show uses reversed ding dong it's a
[01:19:53] lot it's it's 1001 am no longer serving
[01:19:57] breakfast sing Cho's rain swords he says
[01:20:00] man [ __ ] you no longer have Buffs
[01:20:03] even if he's outside abandoned Circle no
[01:20:05] longer the orders is gone sing trolls
[01:20:07] rain swords they do less damage now
[01:20:08] kazua he's a nice guy he says you know
[01:20:10] what you know what Bennett
[01:20:13] I love you
[01:20:14] I respect you I'm gonna make you
[01:20:17] breakfast so cos was burst even if
[01:20:19] Bennett's expired even if his order is
[01:20:20] no longer valid it still works but
[01:20:23] Syncro no Synchro says [ __ ] you bet it I
[01:20:26] don't even like you his rain swords
[01:20:28] didn't snapshot
[01:20:30] now you know it's not shouting
[01:20:38] okay why this thing show not snapshot
[01:20:40] though that actually doesn't make sense
[01:20:41] his ability looks like it's not shots it
[01:20:44] literally looks the same as Beto
[01:20:52] what the [ __ ] was that POV
[01:20:57] ich
[01:21:04] oh
[01:21:09] wow
[01:21:24] I want to use throttle
[01:21:42] we all know you're gonna click Primo jab

[01:22:23] free to play relatable
[01:22:26] that's not good I mean I'll keep it just
[01:22:28] in case
[01:22:39] foreign
[01:22:57] but it's also not worse they're just
[01:23:00] both good basically
[01:23:04] basically okay here's what 4.0 did for
[01:23:06] xiaomanes basically it made it to where
[01:23:09] if you farmed Vermillion before 4.0 you
[01:23:11] were done and every decision you've made
[01:23:13] has been bad now listen I'm in the same
[01:23:16] boat as you I've accepted this reality
[01:23:18] I'm just saying now that 4.0 is out you
[01:23:20] can either if you want to do a domain
[01:23:21] you do Marie Jose which is about as good
[01:23:23] or you strong box Vermillion
[01:23:40] as I ask what mean poggers okay this has
[01:23:43] to be bait I'm going through your chat

[01:47:59] wants to show it who has many forms
[01:48:03] many friends
[01:48:05] uh and many play styles
[01:48:08] of course and and he screams lament very
[01:48:12] loud he's actually so big that when you

[01:48:16] have to zoom out
[01:48:18] to be able to like full you can't even
[01:48:19] see if it cuts him off but then you go

[01:53:33] the time so I need so much every time
[01:53:34] okay this is what I came to the it took
[01:53:37] me like half a year to realize that
[01:53:38] every time I play a lot I don't have
[01:53:39] enough VR and that's because I used to
[01:53:41] build her assuming I have Syncro with
[01:53:43] her but then I realized that I end up
[01:53:45] just not playing Synchro and then my
[01:53:46] lawn never can use her [ __ ] burst
[01:53:48] ever and I get [ __ ] so I just give her
[01:53:50] way too much here well it's not even too
[01:53:51] much but I give her a lot of yarn out

[01:56:13] foreign
[01:56:27] so the last official guide was like
[01:56:30] super long ago and then that official
[01:56:32] video was still long it was like nine
[01:56:33] months or something so I think it is due
[01:56:35] I should have made a High Drive C video
[01:56:37] but uh whatever
[01:56:43] you do nothing
[01:56:48] seals
[01:56:58] dude they're actually so cute
[01:57:06] serious questions Hydro MC actually bad
[01:57:10] uh I mean bad is subjective uh like you
[01:57:13] know what is bad right like how can
[01:57:17] someone win if winning means that
[01:57:19] someone loses
[01:57:23] foreign
[01:57:48] you're like oh I need a hydro okay then

[01:58:07] get an electron C with like Ito or Xiao
[01:58:09] if you're like super energy starved it's
[01:58:11] not good but it's fine it's like
[01:58:13] electron C actually has a use it's not
[01:58:15] like they're not terrible
[01:58:17] they can also be good
[01:58:19] um
[01:58:21] if you have like no Electro options in
[01:58:23] like a dendro team
[01:58:25] um it's not great but like there's like
[01:58:28] some stuff you can do it's a battery
[01:58:30] that needs a battery but if you have no
[01:58:32] other options you can use it
[01:58:33] them hey
