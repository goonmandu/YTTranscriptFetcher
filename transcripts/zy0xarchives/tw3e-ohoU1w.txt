[00:22:05] a story I just I plan things ahead this
[00:22:08] is a rehearsed stream I've yapped for
[00:22:11] like 4 hours today I recorded a 30
[00:22:13] minute unlisted video that I'm never
[00:22:15] going to upload just because I had to
[00:22:16] get it
[00:22:24] out
[00:22:26] so the main thing we have to talk
[00:22:30] about that I would label as drama is um
[00:22:34] I you know tweeted my benched tier list
[00:22:40] characters and in those these aren't
[00:22:43] even mine I didn't make these but
[00:22:44] someone ranked Soo as being benched and
[00:22:47] then jingu as being benched two Electro
[00:22:49] characters lightning Electro whatever
[00:22:51] you want to call
[00:22:52] it who are voiced by the same English VA
[00:22:56] and then this English VA saw you replied
[00:22:59] so you hate
[00:23:01] me after seeing a tier list that I
[00:23:05] didn't even
[00:23:06] make so now not only do you guys think
[00:23:09] they're benched but he also thinks
[00:23:11] they're benched and so we as a community
[00:23:14] have failed because you have ruined my
[00:23:17] image and you have misrepresented me as
[00:23:21] a person and so you are all in the
[00:23:24] naughty corner for today chat no cookies

[00:24:42] don't know if it'll be good content or
[00:24:43] boring as [ __ ] I actually don't know but
[00:24:46] we'll see we'll see how the [ __ ] would I
[00:24:51] know
[00:24:54] so with that
[00:24:56] said other things to talk about let me
[00:25:00] open my own
[00:25:01] profile other things to talk
[00:25:07] about dude I love this Emoji it looks so
[00:25:09] much better on the phone it looks a lot
[00:25:11] worse on PC I promise on your phone go
[00:25:13] up in this tweet it's a lot better
[00:25:14] anyways anyways it's a lot better I'm
[00:25:17] telling you it's a lot better so uh a
[00:25:19] few things to talk
[00:25:21] about first of
[00:25:23] all
[00:25:26] uh I think with this first so
[00:25:30] apparently I didn't know this but
[00:25:32] apparently the like the the like five
[00:25:36] star Skin you can get or some [ __ ] like
[00:25:38] picker or whatever the [ __ ] you can get
[00:25:42] in so for na you have to pay for it
[00:25:45] which I expected but for uh apparently
[00:25:48] for China you can get it if you buy a
[00:25:51] PlayStation 5 or some [ __ ] I could be
[00:25:53] wrong but that's what I
[00:25:56] heard so so um they're losing a [ __ ] ton
[00:26:00] of followers because of that and yeah
[00:26:01] it's something that's only available for
[00:26:03] China um I
[00:26:06] personally yeah so I'll just read this
[00:26:09] according is this according to some
[00:26:11] sources genins do you an account lost
[00:26:14] more than million followers today this
[00:26:16] is due to the dissatisfaction of Chinese
[00:26:18] players with the Game's new year
[00:26:21] rewards personally Jake tweets like a
[00:26:24] politician wait where's his
[00:26:26] reply true
[00:26:28] but um
[00:26:30] personally I
[00:26:32] think players asking for more is almost
[00:26:36] always a good thing unless it's
[00:26:38] unjustified but usually it is so
[00:26:41] hopefully they get more we get more
[00:26:43] that's all
[00:26:44] cool um obviously you shouldn't have to
[00:26:47] buy a [ __ ] PlayStation for a
[00:26:49] skin I assume it was just like a hey a
[00:26:52] bonus if you want I don't know I don't
[00:26:54] [ __ ] know I didn't watch the Billy
[00:26:55] Billy one I don't know
[00:26:58] um so I'm not going to comment on it but
[00:27:01] what I will comment on is a similar note
[00:27:05] towards dissatisfaction towards certain
[00:27:08] genin rewards and what we get as a genin
[00:27:11] community so earlier this week I lit the
[00:27:13] community on fire 1.4 million views by
[00:27:16] posting a funny screenshot a [ __ ] post
[00:27:18] that honestly this is my funniest tweet
[00:27:21] I don't give a [ __ ] I don't care like
[00:27:23] I'm sorry I'm sorry like I'm sorry but
[00:27:26] like it is funny look I just lit it on
[00:27:28] fire that I left it but like in my
[00:27:31] opinion it's a win-win for everyone
[00:27:33] involved other than me cuz like I don't
[00:27:35] gain anything but like I personal
[00:27:37] opinion I could be wrong Doro gets a
[00:27:39] strength in his community by a bunch of
[00:27:41] people being like yeah I love positivity
[00:27:42] boom boom boom and then second person
[00:27:44] gets to make 17 Drama videos with my
[00:27:46] face in the thumbnail so they win
[00:27:48] because they click on they get views
[00:27:49] because my face is clickable so it's
[00:27:50] like boom boom so it's a win-win for
[00:27:52] both of them anyways uh with that in
[00:27:56] mind
[00:27:58] with that in mind
[00:28:03] um I talked a lot to myself about
[00:28:10] this I talked to myself a lot about
[00:28:14] this about what I should say and what I
[00:28:16] shouldn't say and how much I should say
[00:28:18] and how much I shouldn't say because I
[00:28:19] have a lot that I could
[00:28:21] say second person sorry I didn't name
[00:28:24] them because I don't know I don't I
[00:28:27] don't name people I'm just like that
[00:28:29] Doro 44 and teone are you happy anyways
[00:28:35] um okay do you know why I don't say do
[00:28:38] you know why okay I've noticed this by
[00:28:40] being I've noticed this by lurking in a
[00:28:42] stream he has mods that will ping him
[00:28:45] anytime anyone mentions his name do you
[00:28:47] know this like it's not a bad thing do
[00:28:48] what you want I'm not flaming but like
[00:28:50] literally like people that ping him
[00:28:53] whenever his name is mentioned do you
[00:28:54] know this it's literally free content
[00:28:57] with which is why I am very careful
[00:28:59] about talking about people that make
[00:29:00] content anytime you talk about them it
[00:29:02] doesn't matter like I don't care I'm not
[00:29:03] saying anything mean I love everyone but
[00:29:05] I'm just saying it's a thing so anyways
[00:29:09] uh it's true though like it is but like
[00:29:12] who cares like it's not a bad thing it's
[00:29:13] just it's a thing so yeah uh with that
[00:29:17] in
[00:29:18] mind with that in mind be nice chat with
[00:29:21] that in mind here's something that I
[00:29:23] want to clarify I've been very
[00:29:24] thoughtful about what I should say and
[00:29:26] what I shouldn't say because whatever I
[00:29:27] say is going to get clipped so here's
[00:29:28] the part well here's what I tweeted by
[00:29:31] the way uh unrelated to like them like
[00:29:33] the people I talked about completely
[00:29:35] unrelated I just saw a bunch of [ __ ]
[00:29:36] on my timeline being like genon is so
[00:29:38] much better than star rail star so like
[00:29:41] dude shut the [ __ ] up like literally get
[00:29:43] a life go outside like this isn't about
[00:29:44] contact it's about random individuals
[00:29:46] like [ __ ] fighting for no reason it's
[00:29:48] like bro go outside it's like look and I
[00:29:51] said This I Swear every few weeks G HR
[00:29:53] players have to start comparing games
[00:29:54] and fighting each other for some
[00:29:55] validation that their favorite game is
[00:29:56] better who cares play what you like
[00:29:58] they're completely different games most
[00:30:00] people agree with me some people would
[00:30:02] quote tweet this and say like who cares
[00:30:04] I care because we need better rewards in
[00:30:06] genin True by the way but that's not
[00:30:08] what I'm saying people disingenuously
[00:30:11] change the argument
[00:30:13] listen I have since day one said we need
[00:30:17] this this this this this inion and I
[00:30:19] still say it every day there's a lot of
[00:30:20] [ __ ] we need however that's not what
[00:30:24] we're talking about there's a difference
[00:30:25] between people being like yeah genin so
[00:30:27] much better than star cuz combat
[00:30:29] exploration this this this this oh star
[00:30:30] is so much better cuz we got ratio this
[00:30:32] this this it's like dude this is not
[00:30:35] like why are you fighting kiss make out
[00:30:37] don't
[00:30:39] fight
[00:30:42] anyways
[00:30:44] personally um and then I said you don't
[00:30:46] have to defend your billion dollar game
[00:30:47] this tweet I thought about these other
[00:30:49] two I just typed as I went and you know
[00:30:52] uh like I said what I like about genin I
[00:30:54] said what I like about star rail I enjoy
[00:30:55] both not everyone does who cares
[00:30:58] look here's the
[00:31:00] thing if you take all of
[00:31:05] this if you take this and you see it as
[00:31:10] H how do I say
[00:31:13] this if you see this and you take it as
[00:31:16] hey genin player like complaining about
[00:31:19] people complaining about genin's rewards
[00:31:20] shouldn't be
[00:31:22] silenced that's not what this is saying
[00:31:25] in fact I think if anything we should be
[00:31:27] more vocal about hey we want endgame
[00:31:29] content we want [ __ ] Primo gems we
[00:31:32] want skins we want whatever the [ __ ]
[00:31:35] it's always been that and uh not to drag
[00:31:38] someone else in this but when I was
[00:31:39] talking to zff off stream sorry for
[00:31:41] mentioning you uh he was telling me like
[00:31:44] dude like we've been asking for new [ __ ]
[00:31:46] for genin every day why is it only being
[00:31:47] brought up now to like a bigger like why
[00:31:49] are more people talking about it now cuz
[00:31:51] there's star rail 2o like we've been
[00:31:52] talking about this the whole time and
[00:31:53] it's like yeah cuz now star rail like
[00:31:55] they're showing that hey we care about
[00:31:57] this other game come play it
[00:32:01] right like if you're G player who's
[00:32:04] deprived of [ __ ] free pulls and
[00:32:05] you're like oh free Five Star obviously
[00:32:07] you're going to want to try the other
[00:32:08] game it's the same
[00:32:10] company so yeah I
[00:32:13] think I think you shouldn't you know um
[00:32:17] I think it's important to understand
[00:32:19] this is one thing it's important to
[00:32:20] understand that at the end of the day
[00:32:22] company tries to make money right so
[00:32:25] like as a community you shouldn't feel
[00:32:28] you should you shouldn't feel like
[00:32:31] you're only entitled to the bare minimum
[00:32:33] like you're like how do I say this Sor
[00:32:34] I'm going to pause LS you shouldn't feel
[00:32:36] like oh I should just be happy to have
[00:32:38] the game or I don't deserve pulls it's a
[00:32:41] free game no no no it's like you should
[00:32:42] be able to like hey you're treating this
[00:32:45] game so good why aren't we being treated
[00:32:46] good or like for example hey like um
[00:32:51] what's a good example like yeah like a
[00:32:53] bunch of especially quality of life
[00:32:54] things that don't cost anything other
[00:32:56] than Dev time right where it's like
[00:32:58] autod deploy assignments we're instantly
[00:33:00] there in Star but we have to wait three
[00:33:02] [ __ ] years for expeditions to go back
[00:33:04] and we got it so I'm happy like
[00:33:07] genuinely thank you but like it took so
[00:33:10] [ __ ] long artifact resets probably
[00:33:12] aren't even coming like I thought they
[00:33:13] were coming apparently it's dog [ __ ] you
[00:33:16] know that's something that I think we
[00:33:17] should be vocal about not be like oh
[00:33:19] [ __ ] you but like you know we should get
[00:33:21] this we should ask about it we should
[00:33:22] complain about it whatever right same
[00:33:24] with like if you if you feel like you
[00:33:27] should get more a BC d a e FG like I
[00:33:30] personally think Ryden should work with
[00:33:32] B de shouldn't have been released like
[00:33:33] that we should get more [ __ ] pulls
[00:33:36] more free [ __ ] that we feel like they
[00:33:38] like you know like we're appreciated and
[00:33:41] people act like oh Zach is this defense
[00:33:43] sitter he doesn't take a stance it's
[00:33:44] like I've always been very vocal about
[00:33:47] this but here's the difference I really
[00:33:50] do like getting excited over things that
[00:33:52] I care about and this is the one thing
[00:33:54] if you're okay I don't want this whole
[00:33:55] thing to be clipped but if you're going
[00:33:56] to clip one thing clip this okay I
[00:33:59] believe that as a genin community and
[00:34:01] I'm not going to talk for everyone but I
[00:34:02] personally believe that you should be
[00:34:04] vocal about wanting more things feel
[00:34:07] feeling appreciated getting the [ __ ]
[00:34:08] that you see like oh star rail is
[00:34:10] getting or like getting quality of life
[00:34:11] things or things that you feel even
[00:34:13] pulls like stuff that you feel like you
[00:34:15] deserve for after all this time however
[00:34:19] if you take that and you start [ __ ]
[00:34:20] on people that are excited for things or
[00:34:22] genuinely looking forward to new genin
[00:34:24] content then I think that is a and
[00:34:26] you're masquerading it as like oh well
[00:34:29] you're happy about something so we're
[00:34:30] never going to get change I think that's
[00:34:32] not the right way to go about it I think
[00:34:34] it's almost I don't want to say the word
[00:34:36] vile but it's not like look you can
[00:34:39] genuinely be excited about something new
[00:34:41] coming while simultaneously asking for
[00:34:43] more rewards like a [ __ ] anniversary
[00:34:45] rewards whatever rewards right like
[00:34:47] quality of life changes end game Co-op I
[00:34:49] started playing genin so I could Co-op
[00:34:50] do like raids with my friends do
[00:34:52] whatever bosses looked fun with my
[00:34:53] friends guess what I don't even Co-op
[00:34:55] anymore cuz what can I do but I love the
[00:34:57] game I'm going to keep playing the game
[00:34:58] I'm keep being excited when I see Shia
[00:35:01] smile when I see Cloud retainer when I
[00:35:03] see I'm going back to leoa New expansion
[00:35:04] like I'm hype about it 4.4 is genuinely
[00:35:07] a patch that I'm looking forward to and
[00:35:09] there's been patches where I'm like eh
[00:35:11] whatever filler patch this isn't one of
[00:35:12] them but yeah I wish we got a [ __ ]
[00:35:14] five star Skin for free yeah I wish aloy
[00:35:16] wasn't aloy like yeah like there's a lot
[00:35:18] of things that I genuinely still talk
[00:35:20] about and I complain about when I can
[00:35:22] when there's a survey when there's this
[00:35:23] when there's that and I will continue to
[00:35:25] do so but at the same time the main
[00:35:28] thing here that I have to talk about is
[00:35:30] I don't like it when if you're excited
[00:35:32] about something oh well you're [ __ ]
[00:35:34] dick sucking and we're never going to
[00:35:35] get a change
[00:35:36] or something cool comes in genin ah
[00:35:39] genin so much better than star rail
[00:35:40] something cool comes in star star so
[00:35:42] much better than genin it's like dude
[00:35:44] yeah I get it starl gets treated better
[00:35:46] and I don't think that's fair like
[00:35:47] obviously genjin you should ask for more
[00:35:48] rewards but it's like can you not get
[00:35:50] something without [ __ ] on the other
[00:35:51] game it's like yeah I get it you want
[00:35:53] the game to be better and I do too and
[00:35:55] so we should complain about that however
[00:35:57] you shouldn't go after people that are
[00:35:58] excited for something or have both
[00:36:01] communities fight each other every
[00:36:02] [ __ ] week for a crumb of like I don't
[00:36:04] know what it is is it cloud is it what
[00:36:05] is it like why do you have to fight the
[00:36:07] other game all the time why does a star
[00:36:09] player like not to I know this is vocal
[00:36:11] minorities but why does a g to be like
[00:36:13] oh you get rewards cuz your game sucks
[00:36:15] and Then star be like oh we get so much
[00:36:16] more [ __ ] you're why are you playing
[00:36:18] that game it's like why like what the
[00:36:19] [ __ ] is the benefit like why do you have
[00:36:21] to do this all the [ __ ] time it it's
[00:36:25] irrelevant but yes you should and I have
[00:36:28] to keep reiterating this because I know
[00:36:29] words will be taken out of context yes
[00:36:31] you should still ask for more rewards
[00:36:33] especially genin players we should be
[00:36:35] treated better I understand and I've
[00:36:37] been advocating for this de should be
[00:36:38] better Ryden birth should work with B
[00:36:41] [ __ ] we should get more like just
[00:36:43] pulls more stuff that makes us more
[00:36:45] content that we've been asking for
[00:36:46] quality of life changes the new party
[00:36:48] Stu the new overlay that's a step in the
[00:36:50] right direction artifact loadouts look
[00:36:52] like they're going to suck balls but if
[00:36:54] they're implementing them and they We
[00:36:55] complain about them we give feedback and
[00:36:57] maybe they read them then maybe it'll be
[00:36:59] better hopefully I don't [ __ ] know
[00:37:01] maybe I'm coping [ __ ] like that and more
[00:37:03] not just that obviously give me endgame
[00:37:05] let me do raids with my friends I know
[00:37:06] that's never going to happen but I wish
[00:37:08] let me Co-op content [ __ ] more Abyss
[00:37:10] fors star got memory of chaos [ __ ] 11
[00:37:13] 12 if they get 13 before Abyss gets 13
[00:37:16] let's just say my webcam won't be in one
[00:37:18] piece anymore so that the one piece
[00:37:20] shout out but you know so those are the
[00:37:23] things but the only thing is if me like
[00:37:27] I have to clarify this because I've seen
[00:37:29] replies I'm not going to go through them
[00:37:31] but I've seen replies quote tweets be
[00:37:32] like oh silencing genin complaints like
[00:37:35] no that's not what it is it's just why
[00:37:37] would you bash someone being happy not
[00:37:40] bash it's not necessarily bashing but
[00:37:42] it's like I feel like R this again is
[00:37:44] about like random one guys it's not
[00:37:46] about like not talk about content
[00:37:48] creators for the most part it's like if
[00:37:50] someone's excited about something let
[00:37:51] them be excited about something you
[00:37:53] don't have to shut like it doesn't
[00:37:54] always have to be negative uh dis
[00:37:56] discourse even though yes we should also
[00:37:58] complain about things and ask about ask
[00:38:01] to get better Awards and [ __ ] so I'm
[00:38:03] going to end it there because I've
[00:38:04] thought about this and the more I talk
[00:38:05] about it like I don't want this to be a
[00:38:07] whole video I don't want to be like a
[00:38:08] segment on this I don't want this to be
[00:38:09] like a react setion and thing it's just
[00:38:11] weird and it doesn't benefit me or
[00:38:13] anyone other than like someone that
[00:38:15] would take it and twist it it's not
[00:38:17] worth it so I'm going to end it here the
[00:38:19] only thing I'm going to add personally
[00:38:21] that I don't think I should add I don't
[00:38:23] think I should add this but I will is
[00:38:26] look people are naturally going to be
[00:38:28] drawn to one of the two games they're
[00:38:29] completely different okay yes same
[00:38:31] company but they're different okay genin
[00:38:34] you have in my opinion a very engaging
[00:38:36] combat system I people like hey combat
[00:38:37] system it's like it is genuinely very
[00:38:39] fun or someone like zff wouldn't [ __ ]
[00:38:41] play it someone like me who went from
[00:38:42] Starcraft Hearthstone League OverWatch
[00:38:44] valerant like I wouldn't play a [ __ ]
[00:38:46] gacha game if I didn't like like I
[00:38:48] didn't know what the [ __ ] gacha was I
[00:38:49] just like the com system I like the
[00:38:50] characters right I like being able to
[00:38:52] move around my characters do like combo
[00:38:53] [ __ ] swap between like I like genuinely
[00:38:56] I like pressing e on duuke swapping and
[00:38:59] then swapping back to while my E's still
[00:39:00] up I don't know it makes me feel like I
[00:39:02] just pulled a miracle in skill I like
[00:39:04] that [ __ ] for Star rail I like being
[00:39:06] able to Auto Battle leave that [ __ ] on I
[00:39:08] like swarm I like simulated universe
[00:39:10] that shit's very for me very fun right a
[00:39:12] lot of different things however and so
[00:39:16] obviously I want both games to be
[00:39:17] treated well I want to get rewards and
[00:39:18] gen as well but naturally there's a
[00:39:21] reason why people are going to like one
[00:39:23] game or like another cuz they are very
[00:39:25] different for example
[00:39:27] honky star rail could get tafa [ __ ]
[00:39:29] lockart or shirtless SEO but guess what
[00:39:32] you mash your space bar they're still
[00:39:34] not going to jump guess and maybe DEA
[00:39:36] would be better if she was released in
[00:39:37] [ __ ] star rail because your burst
[00:39:38] wouldn't cancel when you [ __ ] jump
[00:39:39] anyways you could also maybe you know
[00:39:42] you can't the combat system is
[00:39:43] completely different there might be a
[00:39:44] character you really like do you like
[00:39:46] Auto Battle or do you like like you know
[00:39:48] whatever the [ __ ] genin gameplay is
[00:39:49] called right there's a lot of different
[00:39:51] [ __ ] so that's all doesn't matter it
[00:39:53] really doesn't me talking about this
[00:39:55] doesn't also matter
[00:39:58] but I'm just talking about it because I
[00:40:00] feel like it hopefully this doesn't
[00:40:02] really get clipped and spam reacted to
[00:40:04] because I don't think it matters I don't
[00:40:05] think my opinion matters but I am saying
[00:40:08] hey it is important to still ask for
[00:40:10] more rewards to complain about things
[00:40:12] especially if you feel like you're being
[00:40:13] treated unfairly or deserve
[00:40:16] more however I also think it's okay for
[00:40:20] people to be excited about
[00:40:22] things I think that's fine I think it's
[00:40:24] okay for people to be like hey I'm
[00:40:25] really looking forward to this patch hey
[00:40:27] I think I love the new font whatever the
[00:40:29] [ __ ] that's cool and if you hate on
[00:40:32] people for that that's weird and if you
[00:40:33] hate on people for being hyp about
[00:40:34] starwell stuff that's weird and if star
[00:40:36] and players are just fighting for no
[00:40:38] [ __ ] reason I also think that's weird
[00:40:42] and then you're going to be like oh it's
[00:40:43] not for no reason star gets rewards and
[00:40:44] genjin doesn't yeah I get it like that's
[00:40:47] bad we should get more rewards but like
[00:40:49] why are you like like there's a way to
[00:40:51] say that that is different there's a way
[00:40:53] to be like hey star got all this why
[00:40:56] can't we get all this
[00:40:58] versus wow genjin sucks genjin players
[00:41:00] are coping they're all [ __ ] it's like
[00:41:02] dude like learn to speak anyways coming
[00:41:05] for me I know I can't [ __ ]
[00:41:08] talk that's all I'm going to stop
[00:41:11] yapping I have a lot more I could say
[00:41:13] but the more I say the worse it is for
[00:41:15] me so I will leave it at that and I
[00:41:17] probably won't talk about this again I
[00:41:19] will keep asking for more content like I
[00:41:21] always do keep complaining about stuff
[00:41:23] like I always do but I don't want to
[00:41:24] keep talking about this because
[00:41:25] obviously the more I talk about it the
[00:41:27] more someone can clickbait it with my
[00:41:28] face because I know that I am
[00:41:31] clickable that's all my point is just we
[00:41:34] should be lovers not enemies kiss each
[00:41:36] other don't
[00:41:39] fight that's
[00:41:43] all that's
[00:41:47] all lovers to
[00:41:51] lovers like I don't I'm not saying this
[00:41:53] out of like ego when I'm like I know I'm
[00:41:55] clickable like it's not ego it's
[00:41:56] literally just like think about it it's
[00:42:00] like how do I say
[00:42:09] this
[00:42:12] you you've heard the the boy who called
[00:42:14] wolf who cries wolf where it's like
[00:42:17] let's say you see someone who's like
[00:42:18] always in like always talking about [ __ ]
[00:42:21] it's like yeah obviously they're going
[00:42:23] be talking about [ __ ] but if you see
[00:42:24] someone who doesn't talk about [ __ ]
[00:42:25] talking about [ __ ] it's going to be like
[00:42:26] oh it might be more important so
[00:42:28] obviously if
[00:42:30] like yeah go back to the tafa tab
[00:42:36] why isn't she part of the Italian
[00:42:47] Senate
[00:42:49] true chat Tia or sephar
[00:42:55] off
[00:43:02] why not both I
[00:43:08] agree anyways that's all please don't
[00:43:10] make this into a video at Clippers but
[00:43:12] you could use like a little bit
[00:43:14] especially the like one minute part that
[00:43:15] I said you could
[00:43:18] clip what do you prefer between the two
[00:43:21] uh I like them both I think they're
[00:43:25] cool
[00:43:31] the base parts I mean I think I worded
[00:43:33] myself pretty
[00:43:38] well techto made a video yeah but it
[00:43:40] wasn't about me it
[00:43:44] wasn't I'm not saying go watch it but
[00:43:46] I'm saying like it's not about me it was
[00:43:48] about a tweet of two people it wasn't
[00:43:50] about
[00:43:55] me
[00:44:07] [Music]
[00:44:10] you're in the thumbnail yeah but that
[00:44:11] doesn't mean it's about me it's about a
[00:44:13] tweet involving other people but like
[00:44:15] again remember what I said about me
[00:44:17] being clickable like it'd be easier to
[00:44:18] put me in the thumbnail and to involve
[00:44:20] me somehow even if it's not about me
[00:44:23] like I didn't say anything I just there
[00:44:27] oops wrong
[00:44:47] one 45 minute intro [ __ ]
[00:44:54] you sadly CH was [ __ ] on you a bit
[00:44:57] yeah but you can't talk about that cuz
[00:44:58] if you ever say someone's chat is
[00:44:59] [ __ ] on you they'll be like no my
[00:45:00] community is so nice they would never
[00:45:01] [ __ ] on anyone look I get death threats
[00:45:03] so why would my chat give you death
[00:45:05] threats we're not giving you death
[00:45:06] threats we're the ones getting death
[00:45:07] threats so it's it's not a rabbit hole I
[00:45:09] want to go down I don't care if someone
[00:45:11] tells me like look I get that you
[00:45:13] shouldn't be mean on the internet but if
[00:45:15] someone tells me to kill myself I don't
[00:45:16] care like I it doesn't matter to me like
[00:45:18] it's not I grew up on League of Legends
[00:45:21] and RuneScape like it's a very like I
[00:45:23] have pretty thick skin it's fine someone
[00:45:25] can call me a silver wolf word and I it
[00:45:28] doesn't
[00:45:29] matter don't tell people like I by the
[00:45:32] way don't do that don't tell people
[00:45:33] things like that please but like it
[00:45:36] doesn't affect me I understand why it's
[00:45:39] bad and why it's not good to say so I
[00:45:42] don't but obvious like I'm just saying I
[00:45:45] don't
[00:45:50] really RuneScape is wholesome apart from
[00:45:52] the scammers okay I was in the uh let me
[00:45:55] just just say it this way I was in the
[00:45:57] like endgame pvm like elitist
[00:46:00] discords great people like okay some
[00:46:03] people great but like a lot of just edgy
[00:46:06] people uh that would formed my childhood
[00:46:08] okay so it was very it was something I
[00:46:10] had to grow out
[00:46:15] of I had an okay dude I literally I had
[00:46:19] an Argentinian friend I didn't know he
[00:46:21] literally was I he would tell me he
[00:46:23] hated the way other he dude I F he told
[00:46:27] me he didn't like the way other Spanish
[00:46:29] people spoke Spanish he was like he was
[00:46:31] like turbo like yeah
[00:46:36] anyways you're just like flaming them I
[00:46:38] me it is what it is like I don't I have
[00:46:40] no skin in the game I don't [ __ ] know
[00:46:50] but friendly fire let me spend 20
[00:46:54] resin
[00:47:05] watch a peny trailer yeah I was
[00:47:20] sick but yeah I don't know gotcha
[00:47:25] everyone
[00:47:25] [Music]
[00:47:37] quiet
[00:47:39] now are about to
[00:47:42] get the AG of Star Gen ofil World
[00:47:45] implode when anniversary happens for
[00:47:46] Star rail yeah I can't
[00:47:49] wait that would be
[00:47:54] great
[00:48:08] just make sure your popcorn's ready
[00:48:12] chat Dem 6,000 bits we could review your
[00:48:17] Bennett oh my alert are muted I'm
[00:48:24] sorry
[00:48:32] watch hsrs any be underwhelming I don't
[00:48:34] think it would be because okay another
[00:48:37] thing okay I could be wrong about this
[00:48:41] but I feel like in the like
[00:48:44] Market genjin has a lot less competition
[00:48:49] like real competition than star
[00:48:51] rail which is also why I feel like they
[00:48:55] would would be pressured to give more
[00:48:57] rewards to Star rail that has to compete
[00:48:59] with other
[00:49:00] gas similar versus
[00:49:05] genin which is bad like
[00:49:07] obviously I hope we get more genin
[00:49:10] competition
[00:49:13] but um I think that might be the
[00:49:16] reasoning behind it is that a good thing
[00:49:17] no
[00:49:18] but
[00:49:24] yeah
[00:49:31] people saying We W is going to kill
[00:49:32] genin yeah people say everything's going
[00:49:34] to kill genin because it gets clicks
[00:49:35] like it's literally the same cycle every
[00:49:37] time there's a new [ __ ] game I hope
[00:49:38] it does well I'm going to probably play
[00:49:40] it hopefully I get even sponsored like I
[00:49:41] don't I want to play other games I want
[00:49:44] there to be a competitive [ __ ] market
[00:49:45] so that you get rewarded well I hope so
[00:49:48] I hope so I want more [ __ ] I want more
[00:49:50] free [ __ ] we deserve more [ __ ] but like
[00:49:54] you know
[00:49:58] we'll see why is your Ben at level
[00:50:01] one why is your Aquilla level one okay
[00:50:05] we're not even don't talk to

[00:51:52] [ __ ] UI you even post your uid okay
[00:51:56] you there was an i there's you failed
[00:51:59] the IQ check you you failed it I'm sorry
[00:52:01] what do you want me to do you failed
[00:52:08] it chat do I still have to talk to the
[00:52:10] grammar do we do the last
[00:52:20] one we got three chests was that the
[00:52:23] last one how would I know
[00:52:28] you did the last
[00:52:33] one you l e should run on water yeah
[00:52:37] absolutely but yeah anyways as I said uh
[00:52:40] just to reiterate I think this will be
[00:52:42] the last time we talk about that because
[00:52:45] uh even just talk about it once it's
[00:52:47] like I feel
[00:52:48] like every time I speak it's like I
[00:52:51] shouldn't speak cuz it's
[00:52:54] like it's like infinite I don't know it
[00:52:57] doesn't benefit me in any way even if
[00:52:59] everything I say I think is accurate and
[00:53:01] respectable it just doesn't like the
[00:53:02] exposure I would get from it doesn't
[00:53:04] even help
[00:53:07] 7,510 like it's not like oh wow exposure
[00:53:09] like it doesn't matter it literally
[00:53:11] [Music]
[00:53:22] doesn't oh that's fine I mean at the
[00:53:25] depends hopefully it doesn't matter it's
[00:53:27] not clipped but if it does get spam
[00:53:29] clipped and reacted to then we'll just
[00:53:31] counteract by spam clipping it so that
[00:53:33] at least I can get like 500k views from
[00:53:36] it which should make up for the damages
[00:53:39] and by damages I mean the mental
[00:53:45] strain you don't want your brand to be
[00:53:47] drama guy no I would rather [ __ ] off
[00:53:49] myself but in game in game in game
[00:53:51] however I also don't want my brand to be
[00:53:53] never speak up about things that I care
[00:53:54] about so I do do speak up about things
[00:53:55] that I care about which is why I am and
[00:53:58] it's not drama I just put drama in the
[00:54:00] title to clickbait people but like I'm
[00:54:02] being very Shameless today but like I
[00:54:05] don't care like I don't talk about
[00:54:07] things that are just drama but I talk
[00:54:08] about things that you know I care about
[00:54:09] like yeah we should get more rewards all
[00:54:10] that
[00:54:11] [ __ ] it's different but I'm also someone
[00:54:14] that likes to think that I you know I
[00:54:16] okay here's another thing I like to
[00:54:19] think that I'm chill with everyone I
[00:54:20] want to be some people you know
[00:54:22] inherently you can't really be chill
[00:54:23] with but like for the most part I'm
[00:54:25] pretty you know cool with people I'm
[00:54:27] just here to Vibe if you do anything
[00:54:29] that goes against that that's not my
[00:54:31] fault that's not my problem if you do
[00:54:32] anything that tries to change that it's
[00:54:34] not my fault that's not my problem but I
[00:54:36] try to be cool with people that's the
[00:54:38] ideal person I would like to be I don't
[00:54:40] think it's who I am right now I still
[00:54:42] call people look look I'm telling you I
[00:54:45] I called someone embarrassing and
[00:54:47] valerant earlier okay I look that's not
[00:54:50] who I want to be but it is what it is
[00:54:51] they were embarrassing however listen it
[00:54:54] I'm sorry it is what it is but I'm just
[00:54:57] saying you know the person I want to be
[00:55:00] I'm just chill with people it's cool
[00:55:01] everyone's cool I don't care unless
[00:55:03] you're not cool but like you get the
[00:55:05] point so there's no point for me to like
[00:55:08] invest energy in any of
[00:55:11] this toxic I know I'm
[00:55:15] sorry I thought you were
[00:55:19] Canadian okay stop giving me your uids
[00:55:23] I'm sorry are you going to do account
[00:55:25] any I I'll do yours and the person that
[00:55:27] gave a th000 bits
[00:55:30] but
[00:55:32] 69,4
[00:55:34] 11,895 if you wanted to
[00:55:38] look where that let me copy paste
[00:55:44] it corpa okay what is this pumpkin
[00:55:49] 83 level 90 sha yade spear that was a
[00:55:53] lot of HP by the way why do you have 26
[00:55:55] do you have like maybe it's cuz of Hydra
[00:55:56] resonance or
[00:55:59] something a lot of HP C1 Triple Crown I
[00:56:02] respect
[00:56:03] it
[00:56:05] okay okay uh so far an hp% subside on
[00:56:08] every piece except this one yeah 20 are
[00:56:12] you building Hut is this Hut are you
[00:56:16] building you have a
[00:56:18] Hut do you have more HP than Shia okay
[00:56:20] you do honestly not by that much but uh
[00:56:29] okay actual advice uh Hut you want at
[00:56:32] least 100 em 100 to 200 for vaporize uh
[00:56:36] silly CH hilly so ideally like yeah this
[00:56:40] piece you'd want a strong box for a
[00:56:41] better one feathers usually aren't that
[00:56:42] hard this one is perfectly fine you
[00:56:44] could also go em Sands uh this one's
[00:56:46] also fine and this is also pretty good
[00:56:48] so you just want a bit more em your crit
[00:56:49] value does look pretty good never mind
[00:56:51] what are you
[00:56:53] doing
[00:56:58] that's what the crit rate circlet oh
[00:57:01] my
[00:57:11] um okay your artifacts individually are
[00:57:14] all pretty good but when you lump them
[00:57:15] up it ends up being not ideal so what
[00:57:17] you could do is either change your
[00:57:18] weapon or change your build uh it'd be
[00:57:20] easier for you to like strong box
[00:57:22] Crimson witch or go reminescence or Mar
[00:57:25] CH with finina you could do that
[00:57:30] um but yeah you can also change your
[00:57:33] weapon but I don't really recommend
[00:57:34] going off of hom
[00:57:37] although your ratio would be better with
[00:57:39] Jade but anyways um for your sh twb
[00:57:44] twopiece is fine but your twb twopiece
[00:57:46] isn't that good um well it's not bad
[00:57:49] it's actually not bad this cir just kind
[00:57:51] of
[00:57:52] sucks um so so you probably want you
[00:57:55] probably want a bit more crit
[00:57:58] rate yeah like this flower gives you no
[00:58:00] crit rate like yeah attack percent ER
[00:58:02] are cool but you get no crit rate so
[00:58:04] overall like having less than 70 on CH
[00:58:06] with a crit rate Ascension a crit rate
[00:58:07] weapon is kind of
[00:58:09] concerning but overall pretty
[00:58:13] good [ __ ] is
[00:58:18] this it's fine though uh try to get
[00:58:21] four try to get four golden troop for
[00:58:23] your
[00:58:25] finina
[00:58:35] though D I keep
[00:58:38] yawning wait a
[00:58:40] second Chad I'm noticing
[00:58:42] something do you want to explain to me
[00:58:44] why you have a sha signature weapon
[00:58:47] Scara signature weapon Linny signature
[00:58:50] weapon Hut signature weapon Finas ayakas
[00:58:54] and high no signature weapons but you're
[00:58:56] running CLE on wiith do you have
[00:58:58] something against CLE why did you stop

[00:59:11] cracked very low ER though I hope you're
[00:59:13] running like a lot of
[00:59:16] hydros also no ER here are you on am
[00:59:19] you're on Mis spitter why you have no ER
[00:59:23] C1
[00:59:37] dude
[00:59:41] okay I'm giving you a prescription I'm
[00:59:44] giving you a prescription you are no
[00:59:46] longer allowed to use crit damage
[00:59:49] circlets not one of your characters has
[00:59:51] enough crit rate literally not one there
[00:59:54] is is not one of any of the characters
[00:59:56] maybe finina that has enough crit rate I
[01:00:00] mean I guess ion blizzard Strayer sure
[01:00:03] but I has not enough ER so that's the
[01:00:06] main thing crit rate ER Em are like the
[01:00:08] only stats you need why does your
[01:00:11] [ __ ] why are you on oh never mind I

[01:00:17] all so like
[01:00:19] here CR ciret
[01:00:23] here
[01:00:26] yeah a lot of your characters would use
[01:00:27] a crit rate circlet you're the only
[01:00:28] concerning one is huta is already on a
[01:00:29] crit rate cirit so you need your

[01:06:44] ever find yourself in a pinch I can help
[01:06:47] you out your life is spared
[01:06:53] today
[01:06:55] is there anyone to haven't been on this
[01:06:56] island dud I keep yawning it's actually
[01:06:59] impossible I'm chugging this the rest of
[01:07:01] this
[01:07:04] Cofe going to buy my first battle pass
[01:07:06] what weapon should I choose I need a
[01:07:07] polearm or a sword
[01:07:10] uh honestly they're both really good the
[01:07:13] PO arms and swords are pretty good I
[01:07:14] wouldn't go black
[01:07:16] sword cuz it's not a bad weapon but I
[01:07:18] feel like most characters I feel like
[01:07:20] I've Perma benched this like a lot of
[01:07:22] Swords don't normal attack spam
[01:07:24] and the wol Fang you might get more
[01:07:25] value out of hot face hot face hot face
[01:07:29] hot face but you can get um hot face hot
[01:07:33] face hot face hot face hot face hot face
[01:07:37] hot face hot face hot face hot face hot
[01:07:40] face hot face hot face hot face hot face
[01:07:45] hot face hot face I think serpent spine
[01:07:49] is the most valuable battle pass weapon
[01:07:50] but if you want a sword or a pull arm
[01:07:52] there are pretty good ones Deathmatch is
[01:07:55] quite death match and fjor are both
[01:07:57] really good it just depends what you
[01:07:58] need can your character use em in a team
[01:08:00] that has three uh Elemental types like
[01:08:03] huta or whatever then absolutely go for
[01:08:05] this if not Deathmatch is really good
[01:08:07] all the time some huta teams granted uh
[01:08:10] might only have two elements so be
[01:08:11] careful but yeah both of these are
[01:08:13] really good uh and for the sword both of
[01:08:16] them are fine but usually I like wolfang
[01:08:18] better most of the time like this is
[01:08:19] nice for normal attackers but a lot of
[01:08:21] Sword users rely on their skill and
[01:08:23] burst
[01:08:24] um so I I like I have a black sword I
[01:08:26] legit never use it whereas Wolf Hang I
[01:08:28] would use more so hopefully that helps
[01:08:32] for all this zif Chong it also depends
[01:08:35] on what your other um options are zaji
[01:08:44] chongs why does fure look so good on
[01:08:46] trout but doesn't work on him wait what
[01:08:49] we don't need an umbrella the [ __ ] are
[01:08:51] you talking about it's
[01:08:54] are you okay Ballad of the Fjord at R5
[01:08:57] gives you 240 em that is the highest em
[01:09:00] you can get from a pole arm unless I'm
[01:09:01] mistaken because of this at R5 it is
[01:09:04] best in slot for swirl Bloom Shia you
[01:09:08] play Shia in a hyper Bloom team with an
[01:09:10] electro character a hydro character a
[01:09:12] dendro character full Elemental Mastery
[01:09:15] Ballad of the Fjord R5 you swirl you Pro
[01:09:17] the hyper boms by plunging into the
[01:09:19] Electro and it scales on your
[01:09:22] em or for desender as well for real toe
[01:09:25] thanks for the advice I need to build
[01:09:28] more supports but I'm still trying to
[01:09:30] find teams I like they will get built
[01:09:33] when I don't work 70 hours a week at my
[01:09:35] job dude don't worry about
[01:09:37] it I was just joking but I I hope
[01:09:40] through the joking n the advice actually
[01:09:42] helped for the most part your account
[01:09:44] like your artifacts are really good it's
[01:09:46] just you just usually either need more
[01:09:48] crit rate or ER or em so a lot of the
[01:09:50] times you could adjust your weapon
[01:09:51] accordingly or you could just
[01:09:54] um just farm for like a cirit or just

[01:17:05] BS to your left wait this
[01:17:08] one oh is that why I was like shining
[01:17:10] with Electro but I swear I did it
[01:17:13] yesterday shine bright like a diamond in
[01:17:16] the
[01:17:20] [Applause]
[01:17:22] sky
[01:17:31] do I actually have to pay attention do I
[01:17:32] have to start
[01:17:33] thinking three oh I see what's
[01:17:40] happening I see what's happening okay
[01:17:42] wait so I'm going to just hit them in a
[01:17:45] in an order where I think it makes sense
[01:17:47] I'm going to hit this one twice then I'm
[01:17:48] going to hit this one once then I'm
[01:17:49] going to hit this one
[01:17:51] twice then hit this
[01:17:54] [Applause]
[01:17:58] one
[01:18:13] [ __ ] clean the bushes
[01:18:18] why why the [ __ ] did I do
[01:18:21] that
[01:18:26] I'm cooking watch this count to 10 watch
[01:18:29] yep count the down
[01:18:31] watch one more now we here here we got
[01:18:35] it we got
[01:18:51] it
[01:19:04] did I lose my Electra why is that not
[01:19:05] working
[01:19:07] anymore wait what okay let's figure out
[01:19:09] what to do this one when I hit it what
[01:19:14] happens that one doesn't move does this
[01:19:16] one move that one moves so all of them
[01:19:18] except that one is it all except the
[01:19:19] opposite it's all except the
[01:19:21] opposite
[01:19:26] wait wait it's all except the opposite
[01:19:35] one they have two
[01:19:38] sides no no no no the two sides are the
[01:19:41] same wait so each one hits the one
[01:19:43] opposite so if you hit all of them in
[01:19:45] order then it's all going to line up but
[01:19:47] they they they don't start lined up all
[01:19:49] things are not created equal 3 3 32 so
[01:19:52] the only one that needs to change is
[01:19:53] this one therefore I need to still go in
[01:19:56] order wait I just make this one I'm a
[01:20:01] genius is that
[01:20:07] it all right
[01:20:16] cool was that it okay where's the hidden
[01:20:18] Quest Grandpa The Village Grandpa The
[01:20:21] Village Grandpa The Village Chad I'm
[01:20:23] making exploration cool again this is

[02:35:09] this what the
[02:35:14] flip oh okay before we roll This
[02:35:17] disclaimer the only good like our best
[02:35:19] magal cpce by far is a feather however
[02:35:22] what the [ __ ] is
[02:35:23] this this could be wait pause CH can we
[02:35:26] can we pause
[02:35:29] CH what if we level it inside of Chong
[02:35:32] yun's field inside of the field we level
[02:35:41] it Chad look at
[02:35:44] this currently we have this amazing
[02:35:47] feather for Chong Yun it's insane well
[02:35:50] it's not for Chong Yun it's on a rizy
[02:35:51] but insane feather maybe we'll use this
[02:35:53] on Chia but really good
[02:36:00] now on a similar note marosi Hunter is
[02:36:03] good on basically every character in the
[02:36:05] game in the right team notably with
[02:36:07] finina why is this
[02:36:10] locked because of this fact having
[02:36:14] another good one could be really
[02:36:17] good guava milk tea thank you for the 8
[02:36:22] months we're going to roll this
[02:36:24] piece let's go we're going to roll this
[02:36:29] piece I don't want to see attack percent
[02:36:32] and quite frankly I don't want to see
[02:36:33] energy recharge I want to see an
[02:36:36] increase in critical rate or critical
[02:36:41] damage
[02:36:43] okay so far so good don't let let me
[02:36:46] down or I will be very disappointed
[02:36:48] attack
[02:36:49] percent the game is testing us if we
[02:36:52] remain calm we will be rewarded don't
[02:36:55] say anything dumb level to plus
[02:36:58] 12 and don't act surprised when it rolls
[02:37:00] crit
[02:37:02] damage [ __ ] dude it's fine I mean still
[02:37:06] not bad one more crit roll it'll be
[02:37:08] amazing attack is still good on the set
[02:37:10] could be great for like
[02:37:13] Lenny [ __ ]
[02:37:16] it's fine this is still good this is
[02:37:17] still good this is still good it's still
[02:37:18] good it's still good it's still good
[02:37:19] it's still good it's still good the only
[02:37:21] thing I don't like is a lot of
[02:37:22] characters like Linny or Shia will have
[02:37:24] way too much crit rate if they ever use
[02:37:26] a piece like this on set however it's
[02:37:28] still really good stats so it's good for
[02:37:31] a lot of characters for some like Shia
[02:37:34] Linny you know crit rate Ascension you
[02:37:36] don't want to use this but for other
[02:37:38] characters maybe nette no he doesn't
[02:37:40] scale on attack maybe rly maybe [ __ ]
[02:37:43] I don't know it's
[02:37:44] good
[02:37:51] why I have so many pieces that look the
[02:38:00] same yeah it could be good for Navia
[02:38:04] true a lot of characters still need crit
[02:38:06] rate on that set it's just it's not if
[02:38:08] you're using a crit rate weapon or a
[02:38:10] crit rate Ascension then you
[02:38:13] don't remember chaos resetting we
[02:38:15] already did it we did it with Dr
[02:38:21] ratio into the wind wit the power of
[02:38:25] witness the power of
[02:38:30] guoba is using Nim stream I'm just
[02:38:32] showcasing The Field's utility his
[02:38:34] personal damage doesn't matter trong Yun
[02:38:36] could be on literally nothing and it'll
[02:38:37] still be like useful he's not like great
[02:38:40] but
[02:38:41] like
[02:38:44] yeah but I just close chat
[02:38:55] oops there are two separate Mo I did
[02:39:00] both didn't I unless you're saying
[02:39:02] there's a new one like next week but I
[02:39:06] did the I did pure fiction and I did
[02:39:10] Moc I don't
[02:39:12] know oh new one I see
[02:39:19] we can do it next
[02:39:26] time what's
[02:39:32] the why is your first message dick and
[02:39:37] balls
[02:39:39] okay fair enough straight to the
[02:39:43] point might as well do one more run
[02:39:48] I guess we'll this
[02:40:02] more do you clear pure fiction
[02:40:08] yeah I'm I'm probably going to spend uh
[02:40:11] some off stream resources on Star rail
[02:40:17] to level some fourstar characters that I
[02:40:19] want to use cuz a lot of the fourstar
[02:40:22] supports on starl are good um but I want
[02:40:25] to play some of the DPSS like I know QQ
[02:40:28] is a good DPS but I I want to try some
[02:40:30] of the
[02:40:31] others I ride on wind and Gamba
[02:40:34] character looks
[02:40:41] fun
[02:40:42] Hera maybe Hera just feels like like a
[02:40:45] pure fiction spamming I don't know I
[02:40:48] mean pure fiction is a permanent game
[02:40:50] mode so it's relevant which means if
[02:40:51] she's good there that's important but
[02:40:54] yeah I might try the lament girl sh
[02:41:03] you I probably level her keep her at ezo

[03:07:09] five star character given to you for
[03:07:11] free in the mail it's a voucher here's
[03:07:13] what happens a limited
[03:07:14] ticket you can veto two five stars that
[03:07:18] you don't want to get outside of that
[03:07:19] every other five star fair game you get

[03:07:29] happy finally for
[03:07:34] once next
[03:07:42] patch
[03:07:50] okay but the only problem is it's all
[03:07:52] five star characters you can veto to
[03:07:54] except aloy included in there and you
[03:07:56] can't veto her so there's a chance you
[03:07:58] get aloy on every
[03:08:07] account and if you already have her you
[03:08:09] can still get a duplicate but since she
[03:08:10] doesn't have constellations it does
[03:08:12] nothing
[03:08:16] that would be a good
[03:08:30] [Music]
[03:08:34] idea what no cons do you not know this
[03:08:37] aloy does not have
[03:08:39] constellations well okay you get a
[03:08:41] constellation per PS five you buy that's
[03:08:43] not actually true but it would be funny
[03:08:45] if it was you literally can't there's
[03:08:49] nothing are they even good [ __ ]
[03:08:53] read sorry let me read you aloy C1 the

[03:31:56] I realized my unhinged and inappropriate
[03:31:59] message I am very sorry and I will not
[03:32:01] repeat this

[03:58:04] minutes okay we actually went through
[03:58:05] all of them I don't know how I wasn't
[03:58:07] planning on going through all of them
[03:58:08] these I just don't feel like thinking
[03:58:09] about I mean this one this person is
[03:58:11] clearly like
[03:58:12] 13 I don't know I don't want to think
[03:58:14] about
[03:58:15] it
[03:58:18] uh I don't remember
[03:58:25] the you should have a mod filter out the
[03:58:27] hateful ones yeah maybe maybe dude like
[03:58:31] I swear 90% of them are just like Nita
[03:58:35] or like yeah
[03:58:37] literally
[03:58:39] 80 more than 80 like
[03:58:41] 90% you're very merciful yeah I mean
[03:58:45] yeah I don't
[03:58:49] know I mean also it's the first time
[03:58:51] bands and they I only checked these
[03:58:53] after like nine months so it's like if
[03:58:55] you still say something weird after 9
[03:58:56] months then you're going to be per
[03:58:57] banned so like whatever like if they say
[03:58:59] something weird they'll just be banned
[03:59:00] again but I mean you
[03:59:04] know R is here welcome
[03:59:07] back
[03:59:29] anyways not that harsh on other things
[03:59:31] yeah well obviously like a lot of [ __ ]
[03:59:33] is like whatever like we don't bad
[03:59:35] people for just whatever but if you're
[03:59:37] making like
[03:59:39] absurd like jokes about that obviously
[03:59:41] you're going to get [ __ ]
[03:59:43] banned so
[03:59:59] yeah can B people still watch the stream
[04:00:03] yes honestly yeah maybe I'm a bit too
[04:00:06] gener literally all you lose is chat but
[04:00:08] it doesn't doesn't matter cuz you still
[04:00:09] see chat on screen so maybe I'm too
[04:00:10] generous in terms of unbanning
[04:00:18] people
[04:00:20] whatever the person who said Yo's better
[04:00:22] should be unbanned he was based dude I
[04:00:25] love yay but that just annoyed me that
[04:00:27] was a bad out of spite I I'll take that
[04:00:30] one whatever dude it's just like I don't
[04:00:33] want to have to
[04:00:37] look
[04:00:38] twitch updated you can't see stream
[04:00:40] either it really Fang I think that's an
[04:00:41] option I think you could
[04:00:43] choose look I love y but I don't feel
[04:00:47] like every time I don't want to have one
[04:00:49] person who's like pinging me about it
[04:00:51] all the time when they're wrong but I
[04:00:52] don't feel like going into detail as to
[04:00:54] why they're wrong so dark it's not worth
[04:00:57] it it's a stun lock and they were a dick
[04:01:00] about
[04:01:07] it
[04:01:22] for those of you being serious in trat
[04:01:24] though Y is better if you have field
[04:01:26] time which is why you play her in like a
[04:01:27] t team or sometimes with other
[04:01:29] characters that have field time or where
[04:01:31] you can onfield her as a catalist that
[04:01:33] is when she can be better some dendro
[04:01:35] teams can use her she could be on field
[04:01:37] anytime there's a bit of Gap downtime in
[04:01:38] your rotation but Fel just presses her
[04:01:40] skill swaps out has a really powerful A4
[04:01:43] really powerful C6 good application no
[04:01:45] ICD on the A4 great single Target damage
[04:01:48] so a lot of the times most teams would
[04:01:50] rather just go FAL than any other
[04:01:52] electric character but sometimes there's
[04:01:53] a case for kie sometimes there a case
[04:01:55] for yi if you have more time Ryden for
[04:01:57] on field
[04:01:58] right but generally as a character I
[04:02:01] think fishell is
[04:02:04] better and you disagreeing isn't
[04:02:07] something I would ban you for in fact I
[04:02:08] encourage Divergent opinions yes y can
[04:02:12] also be better in
[04:02:13] AOE however if you're a dick about it
[04:02:16] and spamming it then [ __ ]
[04:02:36] you reduced to just stand standing
[04:02:38] around how absurd how
[04:02:54] absurd Chad I know this website is sus
[04:02:56] cuz it's just a calculator and a lot of
[04:02:58] people's like rotations suck but I've
[04:03:00] I've just to see I've clicked on a bunch
[04:03:02] of teams every single one FAL has been
[04:03:04] higher than moo every single one there
[04:03:05] hasn't been one exception yet I mean I
[04:03:07] know probably like a weird sample size
[04:03:09] there'll probably be one cuz if y's on
[04:03:11] field okay
[04:03:14] well okay
[04:03:18] well buyas website I know oh here it is
[04:03:25] slightly stop Nick shut up oh there it
[04:03:28] is okay well no more of this Z you run
[04:03:33] it then send me the
[04:03:35] Excel send me the Excel sheet Z do it
[04:03:38] I'm a $50 sub to your patreon I pay $50

[04:04:08] official also might be AOE Al like you
[04:04:10] know there's a lot of ifs I don't speak
[04:04:13] in
[04:04:36] absolutes
[04:04:44] I don't know what the question is TBH
[04:04:46] okay Chad why you guys act like you
[04:04:48] don't know Z Jeff's opinion on
[04:04:52] FAL I saw GCM being used to compare team
[04:04:55] DPS and I had a stroke it was not used
[04:04:58] as a factual anything it was just a
[04:05:00] [ __ ] joke example
[04:05:03] okay
[04:05:06] listen don't have a
[04:05:10] stroke what is his opinion on FAL okay
[04:05:14] not scripted I'm literally just going to
[04:05:16] search Z Jeff
[04:05:23] FAL wait no way FAL made it into your
[04:05:25] top five fun characters a Jeff I will
[04:05:27] actually scream there is no [ __ ] ways
[04:05:29] of [ __ ] fals in here there is no way
[04:05:32] holy there is no
[04:05:35] way and then he gets staggered by
[04:05:37] everything okay it doesn't look like it
[04:05:39] twiice as much
[04:05:40] damage there
[04:05:49] is okay never mind I thought I'd find a
[04:05:51] different
[04:06:06] results the Damned will sooner die again
[04:06:09] than lay a hand on me
[04:06:21] sus I didn't say
[04:06:24] anything official is good at ziox good
[04:06:31] opinion fish H is broken I thought it
[04:06:33] was hard to get good pieces yeah that's
[04:06:35] an outdated video outdated
[04:06:38] I have to stop recommending hyper I
[04:06:48] forgot I forgot I'm
[04:07:06] sorry
[04:07:17] Chad do you
[04:07:19] think Chad do you think we can get a
[04:07:21] TENS counter
[04:07:29] riew
[04:07:36] no
[04:08:00] the Z stream did Z told me he would he
[04:08:02] would coach me in val if I coach him in
[04:08:05] genjin that seems like a good deal
[04:08:17] useless coaching and get arm dude don't
[04:08:21] say
[04:08:24] that don't say that don't say that don't
[04:08:27] say that don't say that yet don't say
[04:08:29] that
[04:08:36] yet
[04:08:43] coaching for casual
[04:08:48] game why does it just just ban and then
[04:08:51] unban someone in my
[04:08:56] chat slightly off topic what set should
[04:08:59] I farm for DEA I just got
[04:09:06] her I'm sorry
[04:09:11] I'm
[04:09:18] sorry there's a few things you can do if
[04:09:20] you want to play her for damage you can
[04:09:21] go emblem if you want to play her as a
[04:09:23] support maybe in like a nlet team maybe
[04:09:25] with Linny you can go either milth if
[04:09:27] you want attack or instructor if you
[04:09:29] want em or whatever others
[04:09:36] said
[04:09:44] probably MTH with Lenny instructor with
[04:09:47] the newv
[04:09:50] V would cloud retainer fix de of burst
[04:09:55] yes I'm sure someone who lets you plunge
[04:09:56] attack would be great for a character
[04:09:59] where if you
[04:10:02] jump it cancels it unless you can plunge
[04:10:05] without jumping who knows maybe it's
[04:10:06] like albo's like
[04:10:20] elevator when are you playing lethal uh
[04:10:24] I don't know that to play Val though
[04:10:31] worthless chat yo yo yo chat do you guys
[04:10:33] see do you guys see do you guys see look
[04:10:34] at what we did today are you are you
[04:10:35] proud can I get a PO clap we 100ed wumi
[04:10:39] it just came
[04:10:46] out do you think de would be broken if
[04:10:49] she was a star real character because
[04:10:50] you can't jump in that game so you can't
[04:10:51] cancel your
[04:10:55] alt thanks the people
[04:11:00] claps also I I know this is like the
[04:11:03] most minor frustration ever but nothing
[04:11:05] bothers me more than not being able to
[04:11:07] drum
[04:11:08] I know it literally does not matter but
[04:11:10] I don't
[04:11:21] know dude sorry I like
[04:11:36] fidgeting
[04:11:42] why are you not answering me I guarantee
[04:11:45] if I pull up your chat logs there will
[04:11:46] be a good reason look look let me scroll
[04:11:50] up past the you know uh where is
[04:11:52] it let's
[04:11:55] see is 41 to 10% for net you didn't even
[04:11:59] finish your [ __ ] question
[04:12:02] what dude there's so much more you need
[04:12:05] to like what's your weapon what's your
[04:12:06] HP how much er do you have what are the
[04:12:08] alternatives are you on MAR that gives
[04:12:10] you 36 crit rate that would make your
[04:12:11] ratio fine do you have enough HP do you
[04:12:13] have ER are you running a weapon that
[04:12:14] gives you energy are but if it's just
[04:12:17] crit value wise it's fine if it's Mar
[04:12:20] chose if not it's
[04:12:31] bad I hecking love CV I
[04:12:36] do
[04:12:37] oh I forgot we got this
[04:12:43] piece is my hairline
[04:13:02] good is jingl good with shling for Mel
[04:13:05] team yeah but I like going blizzard on
[04:13:06] her so she gets a lot more crit rate uh
[04:13:09] so for uh jingl I prefer playing her in
[04:13:11] uh freeze I run her with like uh I don't
[04:13:15] know I like running her with SRO
[04:13:19] Brana and then a
[04:13:36] Healer want it overc cap with her
[04:13:38] passive no if you hit 200 crit raate you
[04:13:40] uh hit twice every hit so you try to get
[04:13:43] 200 if you can't get 200 it's fine you
[04:13:45] can play melt but uh if you have good
[04:13:48] artifacts just go for
[04:13:52] 200 are you artifact overcapped yeah I
[04:13:55] don't know should probably level
[04:14:06] something
[04:14:08] I I play this by the way it's it's there
[04:14:31] unlucky I'm try to go
[04:14:36] sec
[04:14:39] much em for melt at least
[04:14:41] 100 oh yo Mia what the
[04:15:06] [ __ ] Mr tell maybe tell Mr P so you two
[04:15:09] make the video ready yeah maybe I
[04:15:11] should I
[04:15:36] should dude my hands are so
[04:15:42] cold HSR when we streamed HSR literally
[04:15:47] yesterday I'll do it
[04:15:54] again some star power creep Smo I
[04:15:57] [ __ ] hate Jing
[04:16:00] Leu D why do you hate
[04:16:05] her
[04:16:23] what day of the week is it it's Sunday
[04:16:25] well technically Monday
[04:16:33] now the honkey game yeah it is
[04:16:53] is yeah I don't
[04:17:00] know a new wly I think
[04:17:05] so yeah
[04:17:13] oh my God this is such a huge first
[04:17:15] message but I don't want a donall a
[04:17:17] first time
[04:17:18] chatter uh who does they CH Leon Leila
[04:17:22] to stram this be a better option no five
[04:17:24] on your lawn if that's what you're
[04:17:24] asking five is
[04:17:28] better I
[04:17:35] mean
[04:17:44] there's a there's a case to be
[04:17:48] made to go for an offensive bow
[04:17:52] there slingshot better on I mean yeah
[04:17:55] but there's a case to be made to go for
[04:17:57] an offensive bow if you're double hydro
[04:18:00] and your SRO might have like sack and
[04:18:02] you really don't need energy on like
[04:18:03] your Hut or whatever right cuz she
[04:18:05] doesn't really need energy maybe and
[04:18:07] like but generally five would be more
[04:18:11] beneficial cuz also the ER is very
[04:18:13] useful for you and you're not losing out
[04:18:15] on much and you're running like emblem
[04:18:17] and you're you probably want energy on
[04:18:18] other characters and if like let's say
[04:18:20] you're like okay well I have too much ER
[04:18:21] in my syro then you can optimize your
[04:18:23] sing Cho and build more crit on him
[04:18:25] instead of energy replace sack sword
[04:18:27] with another sword right um someone said
[04:18:31] slingshot gives you crit rate for fav
[04:18:33] yeah okay um so it it is a to you I
[04:18:37] recommend fa but if in your team you
[04:18:39] don't need energy then you could go like
[04:18:41] whatever offensive bow you have maybe
[04:18:42] slingshot I don't like slingshot yon but
[04:18:45] I recognize that like you know maybe you
[04:18:47] can use it like it can be
[04:18:51] fine you can have too much ER it it's
[04:18:54] hard to have too much it yes you can but
[04:18:58] like worst case you only e once per
[04:19:00] rotation on yon like it's fine like you
[04:19:03] don't need to
[04:19:04] like I don't know feel like unless
[04:19:07] you're like just stack like if you have
[04:19:09] too much ER and you're on an ER weapon
[04:19:11] just go in HP Sands and it's like okay
[04:19:13] HP Sands Critter HP ciret Hydro
[04:19:19] goblet that's
[04:19:35] it
[04:19:42] will curved be better than slingshot uh
[04:19:44] no I don't think so the [ __ ] does curved
[04:19:46] bow even do I mean it doesn't because if
[04:19:49] it did I would know about it but H what
[04:19:51] the [ __ ] does curve bow even
[04:19:57] do oh this
[04:19:59] [ __ ] I
[04:20:03] mean wait how much HP is this at max
[04:20:05] level
[04:20:19] 46 36 I mean okay realistically okay
[04:20:23] look at this this is two HP sub stats
[04:20:25] this is two crit sub
[04:20:28] stats and the effects are both useless
[04:20:31] so it's basically the same amount of
[04:20:33] unless I'm wrong I don't know I mean the
[04:20:35] base stats look ENT identical cuz it's
[04:20:37] 38 basee attack so it's probably [ __ ]
[04:20:40] similar except crit rate is more
[04:20:42] valuable on average on HP but both are
[04:20:44] good stats realistically I don't have
[04:20:47] the [ __ ] weapon ranking in front of
[04:20:48] me but I assume it's
[04:20:51] that I mean there's probably a weapon
[04:20:53] ranking with it I could check my video I
[04:20:54] don't know if we used recurve bow
[04:21:01] though hey what's up guys welcome to a
[04:21:05] completed
[04:21:08] oh I mean there's no [ __ ] weapon
[04:21:09] ranking in this one cuz she's a support
[04:21:11] I forgot I don't do weapon rankings for
[04:21:13] supports wait let me check I might have
[04:21:30] one yeah hey I was right thank you kigm
[04:21:34] shout out to them go check them out
[04:21:37] literally
[04:21:39] just I mean obviously fa was here as I
[04:21:41] said but then it's literally just
[04:21:43] slingshot and then recurve another
[04:21:45] comparable with sling with slingshot
[04:21:47] like it makes sense it's the basically
[04:21:49] the same thing but like same substat
[04:21:51] rules but instead of crit it's HP crits
[04:21:53] usually a bit better but HPS can be
[04:21:56] better similar like HP circlets are
[04:21:58] viable on yolon right
[04:22:04] so yeah me
[04:22:10] Messi or Ronaldo nope I I am not I'm not
[04:22:13] starting a
[04:22:23] war n answer it I
[04:22:26] don't watch enough to have an educated
[04:22:31] answer I just hear everyone calling
[04:22:33] Messi the goat and I hear Ronaldo
[04:22:42] that's the extent of
[04:22:46] my LeBron clears okay true

[05:54:40] hey y you know what we should talk
[05:54:43] about we should talk about how Boba with
[05:54:47] ice water is actually pre-
[05:54:49] based get me out get me out get me out
[05:54:52] get me out hey I if you want to go out
[05:54:56] somewhere uh maybe like people War milk
[05:54:59] for like for the
[05:55:01] cereal and then like they wait for the
[05:55:03] cereal to kind of like deconstruct a
[05:55:05] little bit inside the warm milk and then
[05:55:07] eat
[05:55:08] it and that just like can't they just
[05:55:11] have the same experience with like oat
[05:55:14] meal that's what I was saying but I
[05:55:17] guess it's
[05:55:18] different
[05:55:21] true I mean I guess it depends on what
[05:55:24] cereal so
[05:55:26] anyways what's your favorite cereal I
[05:55:28] like cinnamon toast crunch um
[05:55:32] basic I like Fruity Pebbles I like the
[05:55:35] red 40 in
[05:55:36] it true um I like
[05:55:42] uh I feel like this is a boomer cereal
[05:55:44] but Honey Bunches of Oats kind of slaps
[05:55:47] yo true it's lowkey like high tier it is
[05:55:51] it
[05:55:52] is you low tier when I was like younger
[05:55:54] exactly exactly High tier it's so
[05:55:59] good Reese's Puffs are good it makes me
[05:56:01] feel like I'm eating like it makes me
[05:56:03] feel bad about myself cuz it's like
[05:56:05] obviously dessert but like I like it
[05:56:07] what do you think Fang cuz I listen to
[05:56:09] women on this stream I grew up eating
[05:56:12] completely different cereal from you
[05:56:14] guys like all of mine are like Thai
[05:56:16] Brands so you don't know them okay but
