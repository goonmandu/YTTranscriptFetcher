[00:20:24] C6 that doesn't happen that doesn't
[00:20:27] happen that only happened to me with
[00:20:29] Kaza and I went to funny story actually
[00:20:31] I went to the washroom I was like oh I
[00:20:33] really have to pee be right back don't
[00:20:35] go anywhere I was talking to my my
[00:20:37] kitten I have a pet cat it was a baby at
[00:20:39] the time now it's old but it was a
[00:20:40] kitten so I went to the washroom I came
[00:20:42] back I said oh no silly cat what did you
[00:20:45] do and the cat rolled a temple on the
[00:20:48] Kwa Banner crazy story the cat got six
[00:20:51] kazas in one pole and I was like what
[00:20:54] the [ __ ] and what happened was the game
[00:20:56] thought I was hacking or something or
[00:20:57] maybe they thought I got hacked or like
[00:20:59] I don't know I really don't know maybe
[00:21:01] it was like too much expenses at one
[00:21:02] time I don't know but I got locked out
[00:21:04] of my account quickly temporarily
[00:21:06] suspended uh I contacted H uh game
[00:21:09] support I contacted Tex support they
[00:21:11] said Hey listen uh we're sorry I I just
[00:21:14] we thought your account was locked and
[00:21:16] so that's why the history stopped
[00:21:17] working you guys remember the history
[00:21:18] bug that was actually because of me when
[00:21:20] the history stopped working so I it
[00:21:22] reset and I can't show you guys the
[00:21:23] history or I would but that's what
[00:21:25] happened that's why I have um so many
[00:21:27] Cosmo constellations but since I'm a
[00:21:28] fair and reasonable person I didn't
[00:21:31] activate any of them except the first
[00:21:32] one so that I don't like because of my
[00:21:35] cast mistake I'm not above you guys you
[00:21:37] know I'm just trying to stay relatable
[00:21:39] that's true yeah so anyways I'm just
[00:21:42] saying that story uh now to distract you
[00:21:44] guys from what I just said let me show
[00:21:45] you that my resin is at 341 so now
[00:21:48] instead of uh uh typing whatever you're
[00:21:50] currently typing you can type something
[00:21:52] with regards to the resin amount now to
[00:21:54] anyone who bullies me to anyone who
[00:21:56] bullies me about the resin count one
[00:21:58] thing to say it is currently December 27
[00:22:00] technically 26 cuz I started past
[00:22:02] midnight which means it's a day after
[00:22:03] Christmas okay do you know what do you
[00:22:05] know what happened on the first day of
[00:22:06] Christmas my true love gave to me a
[00:22:11] PD so since it's the first day after
[00:22:14] Christmas it is reasonable for me to
[00:22:16] have cap resin you might be like why

[00:37:58] mean you know if we're being honest uh
[00:38:01] and I'm an honest man we could just do
[00:38:04] this right boom and
[00:38:09] now it's definitely one of the builds of
[00:38:11] all time and I would argue for just a
[00:38:14] background footage of a
[00:38:15] video having extra ER is
[00:38:18] nice that is my argument that is my
[00:38:21] argument also if you use serpent mine
[00:38:23] you have to put bet in the first slot
[00:38:25] and you have to wait for a year and that
[00:38:27] makes me
[00:38:28] hyperventilate true so we're we're just
[00:38:30] going to leave it at that maybe go a bit
[00:38:31] more CR rate that people in chat stop
[00:38:33] typing mod check CR rate that is
[00:38:35] annoying I want to avoid that so we're
[00:38:37] going to do this now our crit rate went
[00:38:39] up by 1% because I'm a [ __ ] idiot I
[00:38:41] don't know why I took that feather
[00:38:45] um what if we do okay what if we do okay
[00:38:49] what if okay hey hey hey hey 70 140 that
[00:38:55] is a 1 to two with enough ER
[00:38:58] actually not bad actually not bad okay
[00:39:01] SRO is
[00:39:04] on okay this is my jade cutter build
[00:39:06] that's why this is my jade cutter build
[00:39:07] it's my jade cutter build it's my jade
[00:39:09] cutter build it's my jade cutter build I
[00:39:11] don't even think I'm playing him today
[00:39:12] just kidding we're playing him in a
[00:39:13] Shang Ling team I'm playing right in
[00:39:15] Shang Ling I think oh my God I love
[00:39:18] Shang Ling okay um let's give him
[00:39:25] a let's do that maybe
[00:39:28] that's so much ER why do I have
[00:39:36] 26 one sec I'm almost done I am almost
[00:39:41] completed Miss failed next
[00:39:47] time how do I get enough crit raate dude
[00:39:49] I don't have crit ra circlets well I do
[00:39:50] but it's not right in and then my other
[00:39:52] one's on [ __ ] I guess we're not
[00:39:54] playing Thomas yeah we're not going to
[00:39:55] play Thomas this ciret sucks balls
[00:39:57] though and like not even the good kind
[00:39:59] which is unfortunate very unfortunate
[00:40:02] actually but it's
[00:40:04] okay okay last character we need to
[00:40:09] gear I'm just so sad wait what is this
[00:40:12] piece wait I'm not a mathematician but
[00:40:16] this crit value looks High I'm not a
[00:40:19] mathematician I'm not a mathematician
[00:40:21] but correct me if I'm wrong 17 * 2 is 34
[00:40:24] plus the 0.5 is 35 Plus 7.8 and and an
[00:40:27] ER roll he
[00:40:32] [Music]
[00:40:34] he your bangs are looking mighty cute
[00:40:37] also zi's basement looks really scary
[00:40:41] help wait where did they posst the just
[00:40:43] basement I know it was posted somewhere
[00:40:46] but where yeah his basement is scary
[00:40:52] bro oh indubitably a wise decision
[00:41:02] what's your favorite flavor of balls I
[00:41:04] like tapioca balls in Boba pretty
[00:41:09] good all right last character who's not
[00:41:11] geared is Miz Shang Ling herself wow I
[00:41:15] can't believe Z is playing Shang Ling
[00:41:17] truly uh top 10 moments top 10 anime
[00:41:22] betrayals okay here's the problem little
[00:41:25] guys I want to play emblem but I'm
[00:41:26] already on 18 characters on emblem and I
[00:41:28] don't know if my Shang Ling can go
[00:41:30] emblem because my other Emblem
[00:41:31] characters are on emblem which means
[00:41:32] there's not enough emblem for my emblem
[00:41:33] Shang
[00:41:38] Ling however I don't think we're playing
[00:41:40] Yellen so we could take this ciret or
[00:41:42] this ciret or o this one pretty good cuz
[00:41:47] now we don't need to go um that much ER
[00:41:49] on like all our substats and [ __ ] and
[00:41:51] then we go and attack sand wait do I
[00:41:54] okay chat chat chat chat what if I do
[00:41:56] this chat chat what if I do this

[00:42:41] like
[00:42:43] Ungar
[00:42:52] um let's do this for now see what our
[00:42:54] ratio is
[00:42:57] okay I might have okay clearly we forgot
[00:43:00] the crit rate okay wait a second I
[00:43:03] something happened I don't know what
[00:43:04] happened but something happened I don't
[00:43:06] know where the crit rate went but it is
[00:43:08] absent from our um our our our our our
[00:43:12] build I don't know where it went I if
[00:43:14] can someone find it wanted crit
[00:43:18] rate my only good crit rate C is on

[00:43:23] b or Ryden [ __ ] I don't have I mean I
[00:43:27] have this dude who wants to use
[00:43:37] this you guys think I can get away with
[00:43:39] the crit damage circet if I stack crit
[00:43:41] rate on
[00:43:42] like what if I
[00:43:45] do what if what if what if what if what
[00:43:53] if wow a Christmas miracle I gained 12
[00:43:57] crit rate from the catch 51 + 12 is
[00:44:01] 63 it just needs a little
[00:44:14] more and then I can do pyro and then
[00:44:17] filter with crit rate boom watch
[00:44:20] this no this one's
[00:44:24] better okay actually good actually good

[00:45:05] okay all the characters are geared let
[00:45:06] me just make sure I didn't [ __ ] my
[00:45:10] bet that's fine we lost a bit of crit
[00:45:12] raid but it's honestly still fine uh

[00:53:21] the start and then we'll do a good one
[00:53:22] of it after wow wow
[00:53:26] oh we could do
[00:53:28] Electro I could do a noner
[00:53:31] team no cuz V need to be first half [ __ ]
[00:53:34] I mean I guess we can do no we need
[00:53:36] J I don't like this team I don't like it
[00:53:39] I don't like it no okay we're not doing
[00:53:41] it uh we could
[00:53:44] do oh dude albo's actually good in hyper
[00:53:47] I forgot I actually [ __ ] forgot ALB
[00:53:49] existed Al actually works boom cuz his
[00:53:51] burst gives you em and it's just passive
[00:53:53] damage and a bit of energy not that the
[00:53:55] energy matters in this team but
[00:53:57] yeah he's not a bad last slot he's not
[00:53:59] the best like you know second Hydro
[00:54:00] second Electro is better coo is better
[00:54:02] but like it works stop typing copium
[00:54:04] it's actually okay it's okay cuz hyper
[00:54:07] is a three-unit team so the last slot is
[00:54:09] anything alido is okay for the
[00:54:19] [Music]
[00:54:21] em albo I can't dude albo's actually
[00:54:25] okay he's I'm not recomending him he's
[00:54:28] just okay that's it he's okay
[00:54:32] there oh my if you play solo Geo
[00:54:39] unen that is like farzon levels of
[00:54:42] energy you need that is like Faron
[00:54:44] levels that's all I'm going to say
[00:54:46] that's all I'm going to say it is it is
[00:54:48] Faron esque that's all I'm going to say
[00:54:51] those who know no that's all I'm going
[00:54:53] to say that's all I'm going to say all
[00:54:56] we're playing these teams uh this is
[00:54:57] mainly for the first team I need
[00:54:58] background footage of Ryden National
[00:55:00] then after this we're going to do uh
[00:55:01] Ryden hyper Bloom and maybe R hyper
[00:55:05] carry but we're definitely playing Ryden
[00:55:08] hyper BL and we're also playing
[00:55:09] IO electrocharged maybe probably okay
[00:55:13] cool these clears don't have oh we also
[00:55:15] need a IO hyper clear that's good these
[00:55:18] ones don't matter it's just background
[00:55:19] fter so it doesn't have to be good o
[00:55:20] mons but the one that has to be good is
[00:55:22] the ioto one next
[00:55:24] time okay we're we playing normal music
[00:55:27] I'll play My Musical
[00:55:28] Journey but I'm Shuffling it so it's
[00:55:31] going to go all over the
[00:55:33] place em Ryden
[00:55:37] based okay you want the most the most
[00:55:40] base Take On Em Ryden okay listen it's
[00:55:43] funny but it actually works and it's the
[00:55:46] best offensive option for hyper Loom so
[00:55:48] because of that plus the funny factor I
[00:55:51] like it however it's very rarely more
[00:55:54] efficient to do that than just [ __ ]
[00:55:56] clap Kookie as a two in one and then
[00:55:57] just use R in another team with Shang
[00:55:59] Ling or [ __ ] anything but since it's
[00:56:01] funny and works it's funny it's just
[00:56:04] like it's not much it's not like much
[00:56:07] better than cookie it's just like a bit
[00:56:09] better so it's like yeah it's mainly if
[00:56:11] you don't have C2
[00:56:13] cookie but it's funny so I like
[00:56:23] it okay I'm ready to record double
[00:56:26] crowning there no okay shut up B that on
[00:56:31] okay I'm ready let's go Crown changling
[00:56:33] uh I don't remember the rotation at all
[00:56:35] by the way like I haven't played this
[00:56:36] team okay listen I haven't played this
[00:56:38] team since 1994 so I'm just going to
[00:56:40] press buttons and it should work that's
[00:56:42] all I'm going to say that's literally

[00:56:46] going to say illusion my sword r c wait
[00:56:50] why am I on sack
[00:56:53] sword hey
[00:56:56] outlines your face now You Shall Perish
[00:57:00] wait where the [ __ ] did I did I not

[00:57:27] inuma shines
[00:57:34] Eternal Pepe wc2 Pepe W suck my balls
[00:57:38] okay I'm sorry okay uh I'm not the what
[00:57:42] if we Omega Omega Alpha Omega Elemental
[00:57:46] Mastery buff or cie we Nita burst ALB
[00:57:48] burst then we swap and then they die
[00:57:51] good take good take watch this you ready
[00:57:53] watch this watch this you ready watch
[00:57:55] this
[00:57:57] oh my God burst the
[00:58:00] a feel this ancient power with me
[00:58:06] Cascade look at this em wow wowzers
[00:58:09] wowza wow stravaganza I didn't dude they
[00:58:13] ungrouped they literally ungrouped
[00:58:14] that's not my fault is it my fault they
[00:58:16] ungrouped no it is not now testing my
[00:58:22] patience dude I'm going to l
[00:58:27] okay listen they ungrouped they
[00:58:28] ungrouped they ungrouped they ungrouped
[00:58:30] they ungrouped it's not my fault dude
[00:58:32] listen yes should you start with the
[00:58:34] geomancer so the group yes did I for
[00:58:37] Gore

[00:58:49] okay I'm not saying it snapshots I'm
[00:58:51] saying it you buff your em and then you
[00:58:53] hyper Bloom so it's doing more like even
[00:58:56] is not the whole duration it's just
[00:58:57] doing
[00:59:01] more but also I'm not exactly sure how
[00:59:03] that works I'm not going to

[01:08:04] so just like dodging everything with eye
[01:08:05] frames but I mean it did good so like
[01:08:07] the clear was pretty good for a single
[01:08:09] Target team in AOE it's not bad it was
[01:08:11] just kind of like looking at it visually
[01:08:13] was kind of weird okay I'm going to save
[01:08:15] that recording just cuz I have to send
[01:08:16] it to Z um for my next video that we're
[01:08:19] rushing out let me just title it uh

[01:08:30] do Ryden with oh [ __ ] okay unless I do
[01:08:33] ride and Hyper carry which we could I
[01:08:37] think we're going to do full em Ryden
[01:08:39] hyper Bloom now I know what you're
[01:08:41] thinking Zio that is forbidden Z how
[01:08:44] dare you Z how could you we're doing
[01:08:50] it we're doing
[01:08:53] it I'm just going to take all my cookie

[01:09:21] .m fully em I didn't feel so wrong I
[01:09:23] agree it's good but I agree that it
[01:09:26] feels so wrong I agree we are on the
[01:09:28] same page Paige is Paige in a mode let
[01:09:30] me try Paige paig why is P paage
[01:09:35] stage stage I
[01:09:38] got okay um everyone else is geared I'm
[01:09:42] pretty sure but what is the team we're
[01:09:43] going to do
[01:09:45] probably Ryden B
[01:10:07] the only problem with using Ayo in this
[01:10:10] team I mean we can use kokomi cuz we
[01:10:12] don't have a Healer if we don't coomi if
[01:10:14] we don't Ki we don't have a Healer which
[01:10:16] is fine for me cuz I'm just so talented
[01:10:19] but
[01:10:20] um yeah it would be um
[01:10:25] nice to be able to use iton and other
[01:10:27] team for for footage as well okay I'm
[01:10:29] skipping this song I'm also skipping
[01:10:43] this where the [ __ ] is
[01:10:47] BET don't say Dory uh yeah so this is
[01:10:51] happening no matter what last slot is
[01:10:52] either G to be AO or
[01:11:05] kakomi actually what if we don't play
[01:11:07] bet because if I don't play bet then I
[01:11:09] could do no but I need GI on the second
[01:11:11] half
[01:11:16] [ __ ] do I even need a
[01:11:19] Healer dude I honestly take so little
[01:11:22] damage I don't need a Healer I'm just so
[01:11:24] gifted
[01:11:38] wait how the [ __ ] am I getting my Betos
[01:11:39] burst back wait chat how how the [ __ ] do
[01:11:43] you get Betos bur back in this team um I
[01:11:46] might need a lot of fav and
[01:11:53] er you're not right in Al the point of
[01:11:55] this team is you don't use Ryden
[01:12:01] alt oh
[01:12:05] God Ryden e yeah I mean I guess that's
[01:12:10] fair but it's what 50% chance every hit
[01:12:13] how many hits per R I guess ryen ver
[01:12:15] last yeah yeah I'm sure it'll be fine if
[01:12:17] we have and we have the card that gives
[01:12:19] 20 ER we'll be fine will we be fine I
[01:12:22] don't trust it cuz I yeah we'll be fine
[01:12:26] you have ER
[01:12:27] Sands yeah we'll actually be fine I
[01:12:29] think like unironically I think we'll be
[01:12:30] fine cuz we have ER card from Abyss ER
[01:12:33] sand Ryden is a decent battery even just
[01:12:36] from his
[01:12:40] skill yeah we'll be
[01:12:49] fine all
[01:12:51] right okay chop
[01:12:56] TF IO we actually could be TFO here it's
[01:12:59] probably optimal if you're going double
[01:13:01] Electro like usually yeah if you're
[01:13:03] going double Electro might actually be
[01:13:04] the best set um well it can actually be
[01:13:06] the best
[01:13:11] set wait should we go TFO wa I'm
[01:13:14] actually
[01:13:16] down oh [ __ ] should we do
[01:13:21] it I don't want to do it dude
[01:13:35] [ __ ] gearing not it'll be fast cuz I
[01:13:38] already have the set ready it's on my
[01:13:40] Soo so all I do is I
[01:13:45] do all I do is I filter TF and then I
[01:13:47] just click the [ __ ] oh I guess it's
[01:13:49] em oops
[01:14:05] wait my good pieces are on [ __ ]

[01:14:11] this what the [ __ ] is
[01:14:21] this did I have no ER
[01:14:25] um I mean TF gives us more
[01:14:30] particles TF gives us more
[01:14:33] energy honestly [ __ ] [ __ ] ER I'm not a
[01:14:36] dude I'm not a I'm not a baby we don't
[01:14:38] eat it we have TF we have [ __ ] TF why
[01:14:40] would we need ER dude why would we need
[01:14:43] ER with TF explain that
[01:15:08] ready wait I should have [ __ ] right
[01:15:11] Is No
[01:15:13] Escape my order of my team's [ __ ] I
[01:15:15] try to order characters to where it
[01:15:16] makes sense in my mind it doesn't
[01:15:22] here why is yeah it's fine
[01:15:28] I guess it does I go right in first
[01:15:29] anyways so we do
[01:15:31] this power that
[01:15:42] ended what's my skills cool down now
[01:15:44] okay two I don't need to S the Ry but OE
[01:15:53] sorry feel like we can this in two
[01:15:55] rotations I don't want to use BOS B
[01:15:57] again I know I could get it but I feel
[01:15:58] like we should be able to clear that
[01:15:59] faster wait actually it's dead yeah
[01:16:00] we're fine it's actually dead here wait
[01:16:02] it's not is it it's
[01:16:04] not we should be able to clear that
[01:16:06] faster I probably [ __ ] up why are
[01:16:08] people commenting you

[01:16:14] illusion make yourself some
[01:16:17] home Eyes On Me Be Still
[01:16:30] have to catch on her do
[01:16:40] that yeah I don't want to have to use I
[01:16:42] feel like it's a waste of have to use
[01:16:43] two R like bet bursts just to [ __ ]
[01:16:45] kill
[01:16:47] it but I guess I have
[01:16:51] to There Is No Escape said
[01:16:56] r e it didn't matter it was it only wore
[01:16:59] off like half like after the r
[01:17:03] burst illusion I think he the Temple of
[01:17:10] wiard are using bet for single Target I
[01:17:12] mean it's not all single Target this
[01:17:15] far just one and three two is pretty
[01:17:18] good for bet so let's look get to show

[01:17:22] here
[01:17:25] be
[01:17:28] still it's very like this team is very
[01:17:30] brain off though like you can just not

[01:28:33] power I usually look at the bottom right
[01:28:36] corner to see when to stop when IO e is
[01:28:39] going to expire cuz it's around like 5.8
[01:28:40] seconds is but with TF it throws off the
[01:28:43] timing cuz like the cool down resets
[01:28:44] while you're tfing
[01:28:46] TF so I don't actually know it like

[01:29:36] lord head I love
[01:29:40] it I frame the the
[01:29:52] k okay okay we need to reset right in E
[01:29:55] here so we do this illusion shatter
[01:30:06] on mind the

[01:30:49] hurt
[01:30:51] worthless this is a worst good than

[01:31:42] me me smile thank you
[01:31:51] smile hyper what yeah yes okay I think I
[01:31:55] like Ryden B more than I like Ryden
[01:31:57] yolan for that team but for single
[01:31:59] Target yolan is
[01:32:01] better but I we're probably going to do
[01:32:03] both anyways to be
[01:32:05] fair but I also want to do bet
[01:32:08] specifically because R in bet has never
[01:32:10] worked ever and the fact that it can
[01:32:12] work in one team is nice
[01:32:28] um but yes I agree for single Target I'd
[01:32:29] rather go double
[01:32:31] Hydro I wonder if we should uh play I
[01:32:35] want to play electrocharged IO but it's
[01:32:37] so weird in this [ __ ] Abyss dude cuz
[01:32:40] like you can't like bet I don't know um

[01:55:02] is the strongest physical character
[01:55:04] right now his best team is being used in
[01:55:07] an IO Nita cookie team instead of Singo
[01:55:09] and you just don't swap into them

[01:59:38] fan of constellations anyways
[01:59:42] though like I wouldn't pull for C2 cuz
[01:59:44] I'd rather get like a bunch of
[01:59:45] characters than constellations but it is
[01:59:47] a good conation if you want to play
[01:59:49] hyper car or Shang Ling then feel free
[01:59:55] balls balls Lord s your
[02:00:14] sacrifice my sword

[02:00:41] wings and raise storm I hate get
[02:00:46] Bo where do you think you're
[02:00:48] going uh yeah I'm just going to try it
[02:00:51] wasn't a bad clear but
[02:01:00] [Music]
[02:01:05] wait I okay this game sucks I pressed
[02:01:08] three and ate my input will you make upd
[02:01:10] right uh no I'm making an Ito guide and
[02:01:13] I'm making a ride in Ito video the one
[02:01:15] will be out tomorrow the other will be
[02:01:16] out the day after updated ito's coming
[02:01:18] and then R and IO are in a shared like
[02:01:20] should you pull video cuz r doesn't
[02:01:22] deserve another guide like it it's it
[02:01:24] would just be milking content I don't
[02:01:25] know I I I don't know how to deal with
[02:01:28] content like that cuz like I feel like a
[02:01:30] lot of people just want to listen to me
[02:01:32] say the exact same thing I said in an
[02:01:33] other video that's still up to date but
[02:01:35] that's a bit older so it's like I don't
[02:01:38] want to do that cuz I feel like it's a
[02:01:39] waste of
[02:01:41] time um so I only make new guides when
[02:01:44] it's relevant like when there's [ __ ]
[02:01:46] that has
[02:01:46] changed like that's why so I am making a
[02:01:50] new ridden video for em riding
[02:01:52] and like everything but it's not a guide
[02:01:55] it's it's like a I don't
[02:01:58] know you we'll see it'll be a worthwhile
[02:02:02] watch where do you think just cuz it's
[02:02:04] not worth like a
[02:02:07] [ __ ] yeah you don't need a 25 you
[02:02:10] don't need a 40 minute video saying Hey
[02:02:12] go em and [ __ ] dragon's Bane on Ryden
[02:02:15] because it's a bit more offensive Kookie
[02:02:18] but doesn't heal so if you need a Healer
[02:02:20] Kookie is just better if you don't then
[02:02:22] go R in like that's it that's literally
[02:02:24] it so there's a I'm putting it as part
[02:02:26] of another
[02:02:36] video Let's light it up it's one of the
[02:02:39] best single T teams it's also one of
[02:02:40] everyone's best single T teams everyone
[02:02:42] like literally every single character in
[02:02:44] the
[02:02:45] game but it's good especially if you
[02:02:47] don't have C2 cookie or if you want like
[02:02:50] you don't need a Healer like you need
[02:02:51] you can go full offensive options like
[02:02:52] there's good teams like that he's going
[02:02:53] to drop here I probably should burst but
[02:02:55] I'm going to wait cuz I wasn't
[02:02:58] ready like it's actually not
[02:03:10] bad
[02:03:12] solidify of the teamwork is I'm too late
[02:03:15] on this I think here I'm stuck yeah I
[02:03:19] was tooo late worthless
[02:03:23] I didn't care

[02:05:29] best clears but it just seem to be like
[02:05:30] decent so I'm doing a few different
[02:05:32] teams
[02:05:35] here the sh part doesn't matter though
[02:05:37] that's just cuz I I don't care about
[02:05:38] second

[02:07:37] think Shia especially with farzon but
[02:07:38] just in general like he's pretty good
[02:07:40] right now yeah especially with farzon so
[02:07:42] like why the [ __ ] would
[02:07:45] I
[02:07:47] um what I use right uh his C6
[02:07:53] like he doesn't need
[02:08:18] it all right I was chatting all right Z
[02:08:21] sent me a clip but I don't know if I
[02:08:22] want to watch it on stream what is
[02:08:27] this he said it's
[02:08:32] funny it's just it it
[02:08:37] is D I like having a stroke wait what is
[02:08:42] this it's just it it
[02:08:47] is dude I is there more it's just it it
[02:08:52] is wait wait can you put
[02:09:01] that we could put that as after credit
[02:09:13] scene wait Z already almost done the
[02:09:16] video what the [ __ ] she what a [ __ ]
[02:09:18] Legend gu speedrunning in the holiday
[02:09:22] times I deserves a raise any is um show
[02:09:25] it's literally just it's the editor
[02:09:27] there's no like actual footage I mean I
[02:09:28] could show but like it's just like it's
[02:09:31] the [ __ ] editor look I'll show you
[02:09:33] it's just like
[02:09:34] this
[02:09:37] um it's just it it
[02:09:42] is it's just it it
[02:09:46] is I'd put that at the end of the video
[02:09:48] probably
[02:09:52] I can't I actually can't so those I do
[02:09:54] that when I'm
[02:09:56] recording no it's a serious video it's
[02:09:58] like a guide esque so okay here's what I
[02:10:01] decided to do this might be the wrong
[02:10:02] decision I think I try to make as many
[02:10:04] updated guides for characters as I can
[02:10:06] cuz it's a lot of people just want it
[02:10:08] but when a character doesn't change much
[02:10:10] at all and the last guide is still
[02:10:11] relevant I try to only update the
[02:10:13] important like the new stuff if it
[02:10:15] doesn't deserve a full video so what I'm
[02:10:16] doing is I'm making a whole new A Whole
[02:10:19] New World a whole new IO guide fully
[02:10:22] updated IO guide so that's that for
[02:10:24] Ryden instead of making an updated Ren
[02:10:26] guide as well ryen guide as well cuz
[02:10:27] everything else is still accurate the ER
[02:10:29] amounts the how to play the combos
[02:10:31] everything the only thing that changes
[02:10:32] with dendro so there's aggravate teams
[02:10:35] which are okay and there's Hy teams
[02:10:36] which are good for
[02:10:39] those for that what I'm doing is uh how
[02:10:42] good is I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm
[02:10:43] titling the video but basically uh are
[02:10:46] they still good with dendro type of beat
[02:10:48] for Ryden and Ayo so there's that video
[02:10:50] that'll help for both and there's an IO
[02:10:52] guide I do agree though that not making
[02:10:56] a new updated guide even if it's not
[02:10:59] yeah like I agree with the take of okay
[02:11:03] the okay it's a weird dilemma for me
[02:11:06] because morally speaking I don't want to
[02:11:08] remake a video of a character where I
[02:11:11] say the exact same thing as the last
[02:11:12] video however I know that people
[02:11:14] wouldn't watch the old one and would
[02:11:16] want a new one even if the information
[02:11:18] is similar like I know people want it I
[02:11:20] just can't make myself say the exact
[02:11:23] same thing I just feel bad I feel like
[02:11:24] I'm I don't know I I'm I'll get over it
[02:11:27] but it's just weird which is why I try
[02:11:29] to make new like if it's new information
[02:11:31] I make a new guide but if it's like the
[02:11:33] same I try to like at least just talk
[02:11:35] about the new
[02:11:36] things reuse the footage I mean I
[02:11:42] could I don't know I I actually don't
[02:11:44] know what the like cuz I also agree like
[02:11:47] as a viewer if I like someone's content
[02:11:50] and they remake A guide that I watched 8
[02:11:52] months ago I don't mind re-watching it
[02:11:54] even if like not that much is different
[02:11:57] just cuz I know it's updated so I don't
[02:11:59] mind that as a viewer but as a m guide
[02:12:02] maker it's like or like you know content
[02:12:03] creator it's like weird I don't know
[02:12:05] time for aack we'll see separate people
[02:12:08] from work
[02:12:10] yes is is usually what I try to do
[02:12:14] sometimes it's not possible though but
[02:12:18] yeah but it's also like like okay the
[02:12:21] counter
[02:12:22] argument the counter argument is like
[02:12:25] you don't want to support like you don't
[02:12:27] want to encourage the behavior which is
[02:12:28] where the fine line is is
[02:12:30] drawn like the moral whatever it's like
[02:12:34] you don't want to support the behavior
[02:12:37] but you don't want to punish yourself
[02:12:39] from well in a selfish way you don't
[02:12:42] want to punish yourself from enjoying
[02:12:43] things you like but you don't want to
[02:12:45] support something that is wrong or that
[02:12:47] you don't support or don't like or
[02:12:49] whatever the [ __ ] right don't want to
[02:12:50] encourage so it's really weird like from
[02:12:53] a yeah I don't know maybe for me it's
[02:12:56] very
[02:13:00] weird just pirate I mean okay music-
[02:13:02] wise Spotify pays their artist [ __ ]
[02:13:04] pennies it's a known thing Spotify is
[02:13:06] [ __ ] terrible for that so if you're
[02:13:08] like I hate the Spotify artist but you
[02:13:10] listen to a few of their songs they're
[02:13:11] not they're getting paid [ __ ] pennies
[02:13:12] like I'm being honest there's different
[02:13:14] things like I wouldn't go buy their
[02:13:15] merch and [ __ ] like that's different but
[02:13:17] Spotify [ __ ] is terrible like I I
[02:13:20] they pay [ __ ] pennies like that's
[02:13:22] just I have a few friends that like make
[02:13:24] music and [ __ ] it's just not good but
[02:13:42] yeah it just yeah I don't know depends I
[02:13:46] guess but also like everything okay
[02:13:48] we're gonna go spend resin I promise
[02:13:50] we're GNA move on but lastly like
[02:13:52] everything I say about anything like
[02:13:54] this and this is important I don't know
[02:13:56] I'm a [ __ ] dumbass
[02:13:58] 22-year-old who just plays games so like
[02:14:01] I don't know I'm just like verbalizing
[02:14:03] my internal thoughts I don't [ __ ]
[02:14:05] know I just I'm thinking out loud that's
[02:14:08] all I thought you were 15 dude shut the
[02:14:10] [ __ ] up I'm not 15 I am not 15
[02:14:21] I am not
[02:14:29] 15 hey you want me to get Omega canceled
[02:14:31] it's the same with K-pop I like a lot of
[02:14:34] the music but a lot of the [ __ ] a lot
[02:14:36] of the groups or a lot of the
[02:14:37] individuals can be problematic or a lot
[02:14:39] of the system of company owns a bunch of
[02:14:42] Idols that say what they can and can't
[02:14:44] do and then there's a bunch of people
[02:14:45] that make them seem like an idol and
[02:14:47] then they can do things they can't do
[02:14:48] things they do something that's slightly
[02:14:50] off oh you [ __ ] lose your platform
[02:14:52] there's a lot of weird things that it's
[02:14:53] like I really like the music but do I
[02:14:55] like what anyways yeah there's a lot of
[02:14:57] things that I'm like not sure about
[02:14:59] mentally and like uh not mentally
[02:15:02] morally I guess is the word not mentally
[02:15:07] morally the G now no they're not my most
[02:15:09] listened to artist is like either
[02:15:11] [ __ ] stray kids or txt like I listen
[02:15:14] to them I just don't know the ethicality
[02:15:17] of a lot of things that's
[02:15:19] all but I'm yeah I don't
[02:15:28] know there's no ethical consumption
[02:15:30] under catapal ISM true but there's
[02:15:32] always better options than others but
[02:15:33] that is
[02:15:36] fair but that doesn't mean like
[02:15:37] everything's equal that's a dangerous
[02:15:39] slope but yes like like
[02:15:44] yeah cuz like at that point you could be
[02:15:46] like you know yeah I'm not gonna I'm not
[02:15:49] gonna I'm not going to get into them
[02:15:51] yeah I'm not going to get into
[02:15:58] that your resin HTS yes we need to we
[02:16:00] need to spend it law student coming out
[02:16:03] this is more ethics like this is more
[02:16:06] like I mean I guess there's yeah know
[02:16:14] anyways why you trying to ponder things
[02:16:16] you can't do anything about cuz uh a few
[02:16:18] reasons number one it influences what I
[02:16:21] do dayto day and my decision I make and
[02:16:23] number two I feel like I have a platform
[02:16:25] that is getting bigger and bigger so
[02:16:26] it's responsible for me to know what I'm
[02:16:29] like to have a decent belief system cuz
[02:16:31] I don't want to like I don't want to
[02:16:35] make people how do I say this I don't
[02:16:38] want to influence people in a negative
[02:16:40] manner it's very difficult like it is
[02:16:42] very difficult especially cuz I'm a
[02:16:44] dumbass like I don't know what the [ __ ]
[02:16:46] I'm saying half the time A lot of times
[02:16:48] I end stream and I'm like I don't know
[02:16:50] what I said in 4 hours I don't and then
[02:16:52] I'll like see a clip of it I'll be oh I
[02:16:54] don't know if I even agree with what I
[02:16:55] said so it's like I try to be
[02:16:58] careful um but also just personally it's
[02:17:01] important to know where I stand on
[02:17:03] certain things um because it's like do I
[02:17:05] want to punish myself because let's say
[02:17:08] an artist I like decided to just be a
[02:17:09] [ __ ] dumbass and now he's a terrible
[02:17:11] like he is a terrible person I didn't
[02:17:13] know it's like now it's like okay well
[02:17:14] I've been enjoying this now I can't
[02:17:16] anymore it's like it's really like what
[02:17:18] do I do and I don't know the answer
[02:17:20] which is why I try to just separate art
[02:17:22] from artists cuz it avoids me thinking
[02:17:24] but I don't
[02:17:28] know is Tom good it's good for uh Scara
[02:17:31] and Sh teams in double
[02:17:33] pyro I'm sure there's like other it's
[02:17:35] decent for other teams
[02:17:37] but
[02:17:39] theold I appreciate you recordings I
[02:17:41] hope you're doing well or
[02:17:43] better that's far enough
[02:17:53] have you thought that maybe it's the
[02:17:54] people Sol for being influenced to
[02:17:55] extent uh I don't I like to see the good
[02:17:57] in people
[02:17:58] especially it's okay in general yes uh
[02:18:02] in general I I see the good people but
[02:18:03] especially on like platforms like this a
[02:18:07] lot of the audience is
[02:18:09] um I mean okay most of my chat like I
[02:18:11] check statistics most of you guys are
[02:18:12] like 18 to 20 or whatever like 20 some
[02:18:14] so like it's fine but a lot of um audien
[02:18:18] like this are like kids or like younger
[02:18:20] people are very influenceable in the
[02:18:22] sense of like obviously you can think
[02:18:25] for yourselves but it's like a lot of
[02:18:27] things can subconsciously influence you
[02:18:28] or you can be like just agreeing with
[02:18:31] who you watch there's a reason why
[02:18:32] certain communities are [ __ ] Pepe
[02:18:34] laughs in other chats like there's a
[02:18:36] reason why I can say a streamer's name
[02:18:37] and you guys know like oh like Pepe
[02:18:40] laugh
[02:18:41] like
[02:18:42] yeah and there's a big thing of
[02:18:45] people saying like some things that make
[02:18:48] sense right some common sense things
[02:18:50] that make sense they're like yo this guy
[02:18:51] makes [ __ ] sense like you know what
[02:18:52] he's saying is is right and then they
[02:18:54] mix that with a bunch of [ __ ] that's
[02:18:56] either I don't know misogynistic racist
[02:18:58] like just bad takes overall and then
[02:19:00] it's like a [ __ ] yeah it's just it's
[02:19:03] weird there's a lot of weird
[02:19:08] [ __ ] your median ages 12 I don't know I
[02:19:12] mean I don't think so but it wouldn't

[02:26:17] like I don't know if if that R was like

[02:27:08] stats quit following
[02:27:18] me one Vermillion run surely that's how
[02:27:22] you get addicted it's just it starts
[02:27:23] with just one
[02:27:25] run Mr sock is there a chance to ever
[02:27:27] play a horror game on stream
[02:27:29] honestly maybe for like a subathon or
[02:27:31] something or with people but randomly

[02:28:00] like women hey congrats bro that's a d
[02:28:05] That's A W that's a
[02:28:06] [Music]
[02:28:11] w my shit's
[02:28:16] bugging
[02:28:18] balls why balls
[02:28:22] how much better is engulfing compared to
[02:28:23] the catch uh there is a cal on that in
[02:28:26] my video let me go find
[02:28:29] it Ryden
[02:28:32] Zio I could just tell you to go find it
[02:28:34] but I I'll look at it for
[02:28:36] you roughly 20
[02:28:40] to around 20% around 20 it's like 118
[02:28:44] like 18 it's 23 around 20 14 wait when
[02:28:49] is it 14
[02:28:50] I guess it depends yeah it depends on
[02:28:51] your team and
[02:28:52] Subs depends on your teams and Subs but
[02:28:56] let's say 15 to 20 yeah 15 to
[02:29:05] 20 oh kachang Mains have it at 14 that's
[02:29:08] why I wonder what their assumptions are
[02:29:09] but
[02:29:15] anyways wait what domain is this is this
[02:29:17] ver million I actually don't know okay
[02:29:19] it is
[02:29:21] you did not name Scara that what did we
[02:29:23] name Scara what did we name
[02:29:31] him light it up don't get to close
[02:29:33] supporting
[02:29:35] fire we'll see
[02:29:39] about what do we name him I can't quite
[02:29:41] see the name
[02:29:48] sorry dude it's such a good name it's
[02:29:50] actually such a good name following me
[02:29:52] I'm just going to have to explain it
[02:29:53] unfortunately during my uh next Scara
[02:29:55] guide but it is what it is
[02:30:09] coffee oh [ __ ] dude boa's far I can't
[02:30:11] get him I'm so sorry okay if we get a
[02:30:14] good piece I'll get
[02:30:15] boa that's insane damage on Scara thank
[02:30:18] you and my scar is pretty decent
[02:30:23] we're C zero but we have good supports
[02:30:25] and uh good artifacts so it's like we
[02:30:28] got the worst whith here though we got
[02:30:29] the three note three note is really bad
[02:30:30] for
[02:30:31] wiith I did nothing okay
[02:30:38] this Che this
[02:30:41] out Fury
[02:30:52] is he on desert no he's on reminescence
[02:30:53] of the
[02:30:54] shanwa I might go Echo cuz my echo is
[02:30:57] insane but we're on
[02:31:00] reminescence is scar spine better than
[02:31:02] the catch
[02:31:04] no they're pretty similar they're like
[02:31:06] very similar it depends on the team and
[02:31:08] character but I know they're similar
[02:31:10] like um
[02:31:16] yeah fire it up support fight I'm going
[02:31:19] in
[02:31:24] like with Ryden for example like they're
[02:31:26] pretty interchangeable so if you have a
[02:31:28] spine leveled up you can save your catch
[02:31:30] for like another
[02:31:41] character we still be following this the
[02:31:43] main when shz comes out listen when shz
[02:31:45] comes out mark my words by the time shz

[02:39:27] this watch this watch watch watch but
[02:39:33] first watch this and now we actually no
[02:39:36] the the the trick is you need a sussy
[02:39:38] team you have to name your uh Wanderer
[02:39:40] among us and then remove everyone else
[02:39:43] and now we can roll it
[02:39:46] watch watch this

[02:40:12] worked
[02:40:15] wow okay
[02:40:18] uh listen uh so our flower is really bad
[02:40:22] okay so if this I know this looks copium
[02:40:24] but if this rolls crit damage and then
[02:40:25] only rolls crit it's actually our best
[02:40:26] flower and could still technically be a
[02:40:28] 40 crit value piece even if the first
[02:40:37] roll what did I tell you we are now
[02:40:40] going to
[02:40:41] test we are now wait let me un unlock

[02:41:35] all of them
[02:41:35] whatever let's just hey let's just see
[02:41:38] if the theory of the sussy
[02:41:41] team that sounds like it sounds like
[02:41:43] such a I don't know it sounds like a
[02:41:45] [ __ ] dis guu toast video from two
[02:41:47] years ago but we'll see if uh we'll see
[02:41:49] if it it rolls this

[02:42:18] crit damage
[02:42:28] I
[02:42:33] mean you know let's not waste our Mora
[02:42:37] for once what if we're smart for
[02:42:42] once yeah I could still be 30 crit value
[02:42:44] but

[02:55:18] both of them the same way so kaching go
[02:55:20] four thundering Fury and EM is good but
[02:55:24] like so is attack but em is good and uh
[02:55:26] Yi and that team can also go like gilded

[02:57:17] crit
[02:57:18] maybe that's what H what's happening
[02:57:20] it's the fact that we're Auto adding bad
[02:57:27] luck yeah yeah but that's just a theory
[02:57:31] a game theory thanks for
[02:57:35] watching yep so let's manually click all
[02:57:38] of them to ensure good artifact luck
[02:57:40] there we go click that then you want to

[02:58:41] it's just three side but it's really
[02:58:42] good
[02:58:44] okay okay
[02:58:55] why isn't this a Sans why isn't this a
[02:59:15] Sans why why did I roll a maiden piece
[02:59:18] oh my God I'm so stupid I'm so stupid I
[02:59:20] thought it'd be funny I thought it'd be
[02:59:22] funny to roll a made piece why why
[02:59:24] please don't roll good please roll flat
[02:59:26] defense I normally listen listen listen
[02:59:29] to me very carefully I normally like I
[02:59:32] normally want crit okay but if this
[02:59:34] becomes a good piece again I'm actually
[02:59:36] going to lament I'm actually going to be
[02:59:37] so pissed please please no please I
[02:59:41] don't want to use a maiden flower on my
[02:59:43] show please just roll flat the fence and
[02:59:46] we can move on peacefully y I don't want
[02:59:49] this to get clipped okay I'm not in the
[02:59:51] mood for a clip right now I'm not and
[02:59:54] and if someone ends up clipping this and
[02:59:56] it gets watched I see you I know who you
[02:59:59] are I hope you're having a good
[03:00:01] day but I'm not just kidding it's going
[03:00:03] to roll flat defense and I'm
[03:00:12] happy that's a lot of low rolls
[03:00:19] just just don't roll crit again if it
[03:00:20] rolls crit again I'm going to have to
[03:00:21] keep
[03:00:22] it please please flat defense and I can
[03:00:25] throw you away flat defense and I throw
[03:00:27] you away flat defense and I never think
[03:00:28] about you
[03:00:32] again it looked better at plus zero it
[03:00:34] looked better at plus zero honestly I
[03:00:36] probably should have taken a picture of
[03:00:37] plus zero and tweeted it and not rolled
[03:00:38] it that probably would have been the
[03:00:39] better take and it would have been free
[03:00:41] wuse but it is what it is thank God it's
[03:00:43] not a good
[03:00:46] piece what if we strong box the plus 20
[03:00:48] maidens no I'm not that stupid I'm not
[03:00:50] that
[03:00:53] stupid do I do
[03:01:00] it oh wait oh oh oh it's pretty
[03:01:07] good it rolled attack it has only good
[03:01:10] rolls yes it hit attack once but you
[03:01:12] know like that's
[03:01:16] good holy mother of low rolls listen you
[03:01:20] can't look a gift horse in
[03:01:23] the you can't look a gift horse in the
[03:01:26] mouse M
[03:01:28] mouth there are a lot of low rolls but
[03:01:31] it's a good decent shut up it's a decent
[03:01:34] piece ER crit damage crit rate attack
[03:01:37] it's pretty good it's pretty good pretty
[03:01:40] good it's pretty good it's a it's a jack
[03:01:42] of all traits that doesn't look plus
[03:01:45] 20 yeah it doesn't um it's not a bad
[03:01:50] piece but there's definitely a lot of
[03:01:52] low rolls and it also had three stats at
[03:01:54] level zero which means it loses a roll
[03:01:56] now what I just did is effectively stall

[03:18:08] it's maybe it's
[03:18:20] dude I spent too much resin today just
[03:18:22] to end on a
[03:18:25] loss what was that language
[03:18:28] tie okay this could actually be good 7.8
[03:18:31] that's pretty good and you could go two
[03:18:32] echo on Like official or
[03:18:42] whatever also what's up Coco Dio by the
[03:18:45] way I saw you in chat how many gifted
[03:18:47] for you to change to Yia profile
[03:18:50] picture in game for how
[03:18:54] long stop doing Vermilion is detrimental
[03:18:57] to your mental health okay true a sane
[03:18:59] person would not be doing Vermilion but
[03:19:00] I've done it for so long that at this
[03:19:02] point it's just going to damage me more
[03:19:04] and more until I get something good and
[03:19:05] I'm so close I can feel it so I might as
[03:19:07] well keep going because I've invested so
[03:19:08] much time into it it's not a fallacy
[03:19:09] it's not a sunken cost policy it's just
[03:19:11] worth it
[03:19:30] yeah you just get so many more usable
[03:19:32] artifacts in domains that are flexible
[03:19:34] with Vermillion it's like there's only
[03:19:36] one stat you can [ __ ]
[03:19:43] use I've never been in a stream should I
[03:19:45] be concerned by chat no just get 7 TV so
[03:19:47] you can see what the emotes are so it
[03:19:48] doesn't look like people are just typing
[03:19:49] balls randomly also uh
[03:20:02] yeah should we roll this let's roll
[03:20:12] this okay could be good not the highest
[03:20:15] roll but not the lowest
[03:20:19] I mean it might have been the lowest but
[03:20:20] I mean like overall because it's 7 plus
[03:20:22] 5.4 okay we got attack
[03:20:27] uh like the 5.4 was low but yeah you get
[03:20:29] my point you get my point you get my
[03:20:30] point not
[03:20:34] yeah
[03:20:38] okay uh what if we okay what if we okay
[03:20:41] what if we level something else maybe
[03:20:43] like um maybe like um
[03:20:48] this could be good on Ryden you get me
[03:20:49] 40 40 crit damage on set good
[03:20:54] take yeah it's going to be 40 crit
[03:20:56] damage on set and then we can use it on
[03:20:57] a Ryden not bad nice we got an attack up
[03:21:00] for a ryen cool yeah yeah
[03:21:13] cool okay [ __ ] God damn it uh um
[03:21:17] well why is this
[03:21:22] locked wait is this what I thought was
[03:21:25] this wait no what did I oh this was the
[03:21:28] piece I
[03:21:30] locked wait what the [ __ ] is this this
[03:21:31] could be
[03:21:33] good oh this was the pie I locked oops I
[03:21:38] thought that was crit but it's 5.8 not
[03:21:40] 5.4 I don't know why I thought it was
[03:21:41] crit all right my
[03:21:44] bad I can't read
[03:21:47] this could actually get crit damage it
[03:21:48] could be good this
[03:22:03] is surely we got a good piece right
[03:22:06] surely no I don't think we can why do I
[03:22:08] have this the [ __ ]
[03:22:26] listen to Arabic songs yeah but usually
[03:22:28] with like my dad or family
[03:22:31] say why does not come

[03:22:51] oh
[03:22:54] uh I
[03:22:57] mean it's [ __ ] attack but it could be
[03:22:59] good for like Ryden I
[03:23:04] guess
[03:23:08] maybe so you might see that piece be
[03:23:11] like oh my God I am poging right now
[03:23:13] however do note also I I feel like I was
[03:23:15] too energetic in the first half of my
[03:23:16] stream and I'm dead but do note that I
[03:23:19] already have this yeah but I mean
[03:23:23] technically this could be better

[03:23:35] see have a nice day thanks for being
[03:23:37] here
[03:23:39] Glo dum

[03:23:50] even use it there is no way this piece
[03:23:53] ends up better than this one it's just
[03:23:55] not going to
[03:23:59] happen
[03:24:05] um just try I'm not trying it's a waste
[03:24:10] of
