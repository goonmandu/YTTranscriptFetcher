[00:20:42] idea wait chat wait I'm about to
[00:20:45] revolutionize The Meta holy
[00:20:49] [ __ ] holy
[00:20:52] [ __ ] near to the wait wait wait one sec
[00:20:54] one sec one sec one
[00:20:56] sec chat
[00:21:01] okay chevis what she does for non
[00:21:04] fontans you get cryo damage bonus and
[00:21:08] when you have F you get healing damage
[00:21:10] bonus so what you can do is you pair
[00:21:12] Charlotte with ch chevis and then what
[00:21:15] Charlotte will do is give you she okay
[00:21:17] you want healing bonus right so anytime
[00:21:19] there's a non- Fontan Chev shoots them
[00:21:22] and then Charlotte gains a healing bonus
[00:21:25] with the
[00:21:27] fontans
[00:21:31] it's
[00:21:31] Synergy inherent
[00:21:35] Synergy and then you go lithic sphar
[00:21:38] sha dude lithic Spar Shia okay okay this
[00:21:41] is literally nobody types Suk in the
[00:21:43] chat it's not leaks I swear genuinely
[00:21:47] when Cloud retainer is out she's going
[00:21:49] to be the first anemo support from
[00:21:52] leeway maybe she's a DPS I don't she
[00:21:54] looks like a support let's be real okay
[00:21:56] she looks like she could support me
[00:21:57] through hard times that's all I'm saying
[00:21:59] but lithic spear has failed it's always
[00:22:02] been hypothetically good on Shia but in
[00:22:05] in in in real reality you can't have you
[00:22:08] don't have a [ __ ] leeway in anemo
[00:22:10] support and your healers like you can't
[00:22:12] go you the Healer also isn't from there
[00:22:14] cuz who the [ __ ] are you going to play
[00:22:15] Chi-Chi baiju no the [ __ ] you're not
[00:22:17] wake up you're not going to play Yao yaa
[00:22:19] with Shia Shia sha that would actually
[00:22:21] be a banger team name but you can't do
[00:22:23] that so lithic spere was like a theory
[00:22:25] but now it might be more than a theory
[00:22:27] it might more than a
[00:22:36] theory dude not even

[00:23:23] so beautiful it's so much
[00:23:25] better it's literally not I don't need
[00:23:28] more attack I'm on Vermilion Bennett
[00:23:30] thrilling Tales no
[00:23:32] bless I also don't need
[00:23:36] ER
[00:23:48] anyways it is wait okay it's literally
[00:23:51] okay you're not dude it's literally dude
[00:23:54] okay I'm about to I'm about to [ __ ]
[00:23:56] I'm about to [ __ ] give you
[00:23:58] I I almost said something listen this is
[00:24:01] listen not try to be a crit value Andy
[00:24:03] or anything but this piece is literally
[00:24:05] let's do the math 5.8 * 2 is
[00:24:10] 11 uh 8 * 2 is 16 so six yes
[00:24:14] 11.6 plus 17 I don't want to I don't
[00:24:18] want to do math it's 500 a.m. I didn't
[00:24:20] sleep uh what is this 11.6 plus 17.9 so
[00:24:24] it's going to be something5 177 + 12 is
[00:24:27] 20 uh uh uh 39 uh 29 right 29 yes so
[00:24:32] basically 30 CV this is basically 30 CV
[00:24:35] plus plus 99.9% attack plus 4.5 ER so
[00:24:39] what you're doing is I don't need the ER
[00:24:40] so the ER is IR relevant so we're taking
[00:24:43] 10 crit value cuz this is 10 crit value
[00:24:45] more what is better 10% crit damage or
[00:24:48] 10% attack well if we look at substat
[00:24:51] distribution it actually is pretty
[00:24:53] similar because let me look let me show
[00:24:55] you guys a piece let me show you let me
[00:24:57] let me do some less here so let's find a
[00:24:59] piece with crit damage and attack
[00:25:04] so I'm going to find a piece I don't
[00:25:07] care if this takes all day I need a
[00:25:08] piece with 7.8 crit damage and okay so
[00:25:11] usually crit damage rolls a bit higher
[00:25:13] than attack so and but while typically
[00:25:15] crit damage is more valuable than attack
[00:25:17] for most characters uh attack is a bit
[00:25:19] less percent wise so for example let's
[00:25:21] say one attack roll is like 4.7 to like
[00:25:24] 6.5 or whatever perc whereas crit damage
[00:25:26] is like 5.4 to 7.8 right so it's a
[00:25:29] little bit more crit damage e than
[00:25:31] attack e so if they're one to one
[00:25:33] usually like 100% attack would be a bit
[00:25:36] more rolls than 100% crit damage right
[00:25:38] but that's just a theory shout out mad
[00:25:40] Pat anyways but but here in this
[00:25:42] instance because we have so much attack
[00:25:44] percent through Vermillion through
[00:25:45] Bennett through nobless through
[00:25:47] thrilling tals uh attack is not as
[00:25:49] relevant but what if you're running
[00:25:51] finina what does she say t I don't know
[00:25:54] what she says then yeah you could argue
[00:25:56] attack perent you know starts being more
[00:25:57] Valu what if you're running Mar CH but
[00:25:59] I'm not running Mar CH so so it's really
[00:26:02] like honestly this piece isn't that big
[00:26:05] of an upgrade but it's still better um
[00:26:08] for us surely I
[00:26:12] mean I mean okay to be fair this piece
[00:26:15] is probably better but you know what
[00:26:18] let's just let's just keep moving let's
[00:26:19] keep pushing actually that's not
[00:26:22] true
[00:26:26] because um
[00:26:29] aasha wise we went from number I know
[00:26:33] this doesn't really matter but it's like
[00:26:34] a sample rotation I didn't look into
[00:26:36] what they math out as a rotation it
[00:26:37] might suck balls but
[00:26:40] um we are 36 we used to be 50 something
[00:26:44] so 36 with this flower M that is
[00:26:49] Juicy M popcorn so tasty why the [ __ ] is
[00:26:53] my IO at six this guy used to be one the
[00:26:55] [ __ ]
[00:26:56] happened
[00:26:58] am I on the wrong
[00:26:59] pieces bro what is happening oh I'm
[00:27:01] probably on the wrong off piece cuz my
[00:27:04] Ito okay the thing that makes my IO
[00:27:06] better than literally any IO here is
[00:27:08] that my IO is usually on five emblem uh
[00:27:10] sorry five uh Echoes I'm usually on five
[00:27:16] Echoes no this one's better I'm usually
[00:27:18] on five Echoes so if anyone here look
[00:27:20] I'll click on I'll click on this if this
[00:27:21] guy's not on five Echoes inferior what
[00:27:23] about this
[00:27:26] guy D why is it not showing me their
[00:27:33] builds yeah not on 5os this guy's on
[00:27:36] emblem what the
[00:27:38] [ __ ] okay this website's dog [ __ ] this
[00:27:40] website is actually the dog [ __ ] if
[00:27:42] [ __ ] emblem ranks this high are you
[00:27:45] joking is this just
[00:27:48] CV yeah this website's garbage how the
[00:27:50] [ __ ] is emblem even comparable to
[00:27:55] Echoes click on the right side
[00:27:58] am I filtering by
[00:28:00] CV I don't think I
[00:28:04] am
[00:28:15] anyways you're looking at the wrong
[00:28:18] thing no I'm
[00:28:20] not am
[00:28:22] I I like to I like to say I'm not and
[00:28:25] then actually think critically what who
[00:28:27] the [ __ ] is this guy why did I select
[00:28:29] some random guy who's at Abyss
[00:28:32] A3 Lord of muscle [ __ ]
[00:28:41] it wait there's a finina
[00:28:45] leaderboard okay
[00:28:53] anyways noted writing down nothing
[00:28:58] Chad ra my finina fering desire R5 c0
[00:29:02] Crown burst cuz I'm a Chad golden troop
[00:29:05] so far so good Stone type zero before
[00:29:07] seeing the build okay pay
[00:29:11] attention golden
[00:29:13] troop that's a good good
[00:29:26] stats
[00:29:29] okay R my R my for
[00:29:53] wait okay raid my finina build four
[00:29:56] golden Troop
[00:29:57] festering desire
[00:30:00] flower pretty good even an HP roll in

[00:30:06] feather nice feather s okay okay okay
[00:30:12] it's okay I also have one that has uh 21
[00:30:15] ER for when I need some Er in my ER
[00:30:17] hungry teams but you know it is what it
[00:30:19] is goblet we have a 14 crit rate 20 crit
[00:30:23] damage goblet that is honestly pretty
[00:30:27] Bonkers ciret crit damage 10 crit rate
[00:30:31] 6.5 the ciret could be better overall
[00:30:34] our crit rate is actually higher than it
[00:30:35] seems because 12 + 66 is 78 crit rate
[00:30:39] 209 crit damage look I play with yolan
[00:30:44] uh and SRO and Ryden so our ER is fine
[00:30:47] but sometimes we want higher so pretty
[00:30:49] good pretty good uh pretty good pretty
[00:30:51] good pretty good pretty good pretty good
[00:30:53] fre an out of 10 pretty good fre out of

[00:45:50] while okay which half should we play
[00:45:53] never mind we're not playing Sunfire
[00:45:54] against the we're not playing Ryden
[00:45:55] against the thunder man if so I guess
[00:45:56] we're doing first
[00:45:59] half Hydro tulpa can suck my
[00:46:03] tulpa that doesn't make sense
[00:46:06] Ryden who am I playing with Ryden uh SRO
[00:46:11] maybe but he's on sack sword maybe yolon
[00:46:13] but then the team's more
[00:46:16] like wait but Singo kind of doesn't do
[00:46:19] anything as
[00:46:20] tulpa we can do
[00:46:22] finina
[00:46:24] oo wait Chad do we [ __ ] with this team
[00:46:27] wait a
[00:46:29] second Chad do we [ __ ] with this team I

[01:47:08] teams yes like you could argue at C6 you
[01:47:12] could use her as like a second pyro for

[01:47:18] play those teams don't talk to me
[01:47:19] although okay you maybe like maybe
[01:47:22] because the the second Pyon of Hut team
[01:47:24] if it's Bennett cool but if it's like
