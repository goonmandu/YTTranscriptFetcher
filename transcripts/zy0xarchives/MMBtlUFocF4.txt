[00:12:31] dude how would I know who uses this m uh
[00:12:34] I'm actually pretty sure one of the new
[00:12:35] characters uses
[00:12:38] it isn't who the [ __ ] is is it Hana or
[00:12:41] Argent one of the
[00:12:43] two well Argent is AR addition so it
[00:12:45] can't be him I'm just going to guess haa
[00:12:46] [ __ ] it what if it's haa oh she's not
[00:12:48] out she's not
[00:12:55] out
[00:12:57] um I actually don't remember who Ed that
[00:13:00] M so we're going to pretend that doesn't
[00:13:01] exist and we'll guess based off of other
[00:13:02] properties for example we'll guess blade
[00:13:06] although I know he doesn't use that M
[00:13:07] but whatever okay uh we'll go for maybe
[00:13:10] a Hunt character I don't know what
[00:13:12] jinglu uses where is she from no no yeah
[00:13:15] she's fine [ __ ] she's that Matt of
[00:13:17] course she does she's this what I think
[00:13:19] she was oh my God I griefed I griefed
[00:13:21] okay run it back next one next one next
[00:13:22] one next one let's just go let's just go
[00:13:24] I saw someone in chat type links get me

[00:13:36] me go again let me go again we'll start
[00:13:37] Lua uh Shu okay we're going to guess why
[00:13:40] am iing to this dude [ __ ] she's the same
[00:13:43] M of course she does but it was a good
[00:13:44] guess though outside of that cuz now we
[00:13:45] know it's not fire or an ail I'm going
[00:13:47] to close try for this one watch watch
[00:13:49] okay watch this look at how I'm going to
[00:13:50] guess this watch let me cook we know
[00:13:53] where they're from and we know what boss
[00:13:54] they use which means it's a newer
[00:13:55] character cuz it's a new
[00:13:57] boss
[00:14:00] blade and Kafka are from like their
[00:14:02] Stellar on
[00:14:03] Hunters which means there's not too many
[00:14:05] characters it could be uh it could be um
[00:14:09] it could actually be Jing Liu right cuz
[00:14:12] destruction
[00:14:14] ice
[00:14:16] yes sorry calm
[00:14:19] down we'll do one more to prove it
[00:14:21] wasn't a fluke to prove it wasn't a
[00:14:22] fluke let's do one more era oh my
[00:14:27] God
[00:14:31] easy as that boys easy as that easy as
[00:14:33] that it's not a fluke he's just
[00:14:34] different he's just different with it
[00:14:37] easy as that he's just different with it
[00:14:40] also a fluke okay we'll get three in a
[00:14:42] row watch this what our streak is

[00:15:06] characters use this I remember needing
[00:15:07] it recently
[00:15:13] uh not blade who else is
[00:15:18] new I'm not going to look at the list

[00:17:30] have been pre- farming virtually every
[00:17:32] day now I overcab my resin for like okay
[00:17:34] maybe there's like a week where I wasn't
[00:17:36] playing much but outside of that I have
[00:17:37] been grinding okay okay
[00:17:40] so turn my music down a
[00:17:44] little
[00:17:46] okay let me show you what I've been
[00:17:48] cooking
[00:17:54] okay so I up until yesterday
[00:17:59] up until
[00:18:00] yesterday I didn't believe up until
[00:18:04] yesterday I didn't believe uh that there
[00:18:07] was a that the boss that Argent and haa
[00:18:11] needed was out okay I didn't then I
[00:18:14] caught up on some story quests and I
[00:18:16] discovered oh [ __ ] the shape of
[00:18:19] paradition is
[00:18:21] here so
[00:18:26] naturally I got some Nether world tokens
[00:18:28] I have
[00:18:30] 130 so I grinded this for like a day
[00:18:32] straight um I use some fuel like some of
[00:18:35] my fuel things these things I have a lot
[00:18:37] so I just use some I haven't spent these
[00:18:38] like I literally have never spent like I
[00:18:40] just don't spend them so I use those uh
[00:18:43] of course it is what it
[00:18:44] is um yeah so we got that we have 130
[00:18:49] and uh I made sure I had enough credits
[00:18:52] now you might K all my credits but I
[00:18:53] have 5.2 million if that's not enough
[00:18:56] for two characters then [ __ ] me I guess
[00:18:58] okay I I spent like 2 million on relics
[00:19:01] I had like seven okay it is what it is I
[00:19:03] also farmed some relics farmed XP books
[00:19:06] not the most but 630 311 honestly not
[00:19:09] bad uh and we Auto battled um a bunch of
[00:19:14] domains I tried to get the physical set
[00:19:15] it didn't work but we're just going to
[00:19:16] go TWP twopiece um it is what it is and
[00:19:19] then this domain I basically haven't
[00:19:20] touched yet but I should for my
[00:19:22] jinguan and probably Kafka but it's
[00:19:25] okay so anyways
[00:19:31] and I also geared I'm not just a yapper
[00:19:33] I'm also a gear my blade perfect my BR
[00:19:37] perfect well low speed but to match my
[00:19:38] blade but if we play BR with someone
[00:19:40] else we'll give her more speed uh jinglu
[00:19:42] perfect uh huo perfect we geared every
[00:19:46] okay
[00:19:50] not inator is Juicy now our inor is so
[00:19:55] insane but what I realized is that my uh
[00:19:58] uh Argentina is going to have to steal
[00:20:00] one Relic which is
[00:20:02] unfortunate so with
[00:20:04] Argent
[00:20:06] um listen I got this Relic and leveled
[00:20:10] it today well I had it a few days ago
[00:20:12] but I leveled it
[00:20:16] today and this is my inbi Lunes glove
[00:20:21] hands feather I stole it from him
[00:20:24] because I leveled the new one and it
[00:20:25] gave me this which is good but I don't
[00:20:27] actually need crit rate on them so I yo
[00:20:29] the crit damage one which sorry Ander if
[00:20:31] we play you we might have to swap it
[00:20:32] back uh body we have this boots we have
[00:20:35] this and then our ball I also leveled
[00:20:37] this today uh it's plus 12 cuz we can
[00:20:40] get the last level together and then our
[00:20:42] rope sucks donkey penis but that's okay
[00:20:44] no that's okay it's fine it's fine it's
[00:20:47] okay one bad piece doesn't make the
[00:20:48] character bad it's okay uh so we're
[00:20:51] going to level the ball we're going to
[00:20:53] level the ball and you might be like oh
[00:20:55] with what XP don't worry we're going to
[00:20:57] level the ball
[00:20:59] how do you have a 999 speed bronia dude
[00:21:02] listen you guys act like I don't listen
[00:21:04] unless you're [ __ ] overlapping your
[00:21:06] [ __ ] Blade with 160 speed my blade is
[00:21:08] like fully optimized crit wise but I
[00:21:11] have no speed on him so he's 101 so I
[00:21:13] need her to be lower so I [ __ ] her
[00:21:15] build I threw everything away like I
[00:21:18] literally gave her dog [ __ ] artifacts
[00:21:19] with a bunch of crit damage to make sure
[00:21:21] she goes slower than blade that's the
[00:21:23] only thing I cared about okay usually my
[00:21:25] brownie has like 1 million speed okay
[00:21:28] usually she does but when I play her
[00:21:30] with blade I try to keep it unless I
[00:21:32] like overloop I get like 150 plus I know
[00:21:35] okay one what is the number one 161 is
[00:21:37] that it I don't know I'm getting one
[00:21:38] guide the whatever the number is to
[00:21:39] overlap you can but I don't feel like
[00:21:42] overlapping cuz I need to build six
[00:21:44] other supports so we just put her one
[00:21:46] under blade and we're chilling okay cuz
[00:21:49] look if I want to look listen look I
[00:21:52] have do I have good pieces I think I
[00:21:53] have good pieces main stat no sub stat
[00:21:56] crit damage speed
[00:21:59] well I do I
[00:22:02] two this one five speed 16 crit damage
[00:22:05] that's not
[00:22:06] bad so bad
[00:22:08] oh yo shut the [ __ ] anyways we have a
[00:22:12] build that doesn't suck it's just I
[00:22:15] wanted her to be right under blade
[00:22:17] instead of having to figure out how to
[00:22:19] like fully like I cuz I want to Auto
[00:22:21] Battle and I wanted to go in the right
[00:22:22] order okay I don't want to have to
[00:22:23] [ __ ] like okay basic attack here
[00:22:25] you're advaned forward then you skill
[00:22:27] like I'm chilling right now okay but we
[00:22:29] can adjust the build accordingly it's
[00:22:30] fine our blade is cracked however um
[00:22:33] this flower is insane this I call it a
[00:22:36] flower but it is a flower this these
[00:22:38] hands are insane body insane well okay
[00:22:41] it's kind of mid
[00:22:42] but that's like our worst piece so it is
[00:22:44] what it is uh boots are pretty cracked
[00:22:47] ball cracked rope okay so
[00:22:51] anyways we are GNA for our other
[00:22:55] characters for our other characters
[00:23:01] we have Hera and yukong who serve as
[00:23:04] placeholders for Argent and haa okay our
[00:23:08] Hana right now um so here's what I did I
[00:23:13] just put hacker space so that I can be a
[00:23:16] hacker and I just put a bunch of tanky
[00:23:18] and Speedy art uh relics right okay but
[00:23:22] oh yeah this piece sucks but it has a
[00:23:23] bunch of crits so I like it so we're
[00:23:25] going to plus 15 this I just waited um
[00:23:28] but for our ball and rope I'm going
[00:23:32] broken Kel because I mean broken kill is
[00:23:35] always
[00:23:37] fine um yeah I mean we can min max our
[00:23:40] speed a little more but just for now
[00:23:43] listen I'm going broken kill because our
[00:23:45] Argent is going to have too much crit
[00:23:47] rate and not enough crit damage so in
[00:23:48] order to balance the ratio to make me
[00:23:50] feel like I know like my character is
[00:23:51] wellb built I'm going broken kill okay
[00:23:54] cuz I need to like up the crit damage so
[00:23:56] that it looks more one to two cuz my AR
[00:23:58] my Argent is going to have too much crit
[00:23:59] rate so
[00:24:01] yeah uh that's what we're doing um I
[00:24:04] need to plus 15 these I just don't like
[00:24:06] these sub stats are disgusting I have
[00:24:07] one I have 114 flat HP but whatever
[00:24:12] we'll plus 50 I just I was like kind of
[00:24:13] waiting to see if I'll get a better one
[00:24:15] but I didn't so it is what it
[00:24:17] is like I actually I don't know my my
[00:24:20] speed boots are always kind of mid but
[00:24:22] at least you know okay break effect
[00:24:26] wow it is what it is though
[00:24:28] it actually is what it is um so that's
[00:24:30] what I pre geared the only thing for my
[00:24:32] Argent the only piece I leveled all of
[00:24:35] this off stream the only thing I didn't
[00:24:36] was the ball so that we could do this
[00:24:38] together so you guys could so I we could
[00:24:40] see if you guys would bless me or curse
[00:24:43] me so this ball crit rate crit damage
[00:24:46] and HP
[00:24:48] defense this one's for you chat this is
[00:24:50] your role not mine okay [ __ ] you
[00:24:53] actually every single person in chat
[00:24:55] right now I hate you this is your fault
[00:24:57] I rolled crit without you guys without
[00:24:59] you guys I rolled
[00:25:02] crit good boots for haa well like flat
[00:25:05] HP is never like ideal right like unless
[00:25:08] your base HP is literally four flat HP
[00:25:11] is kind of cope compared to percent or
[00:25:13] whatever other set you
[00:25:15] want but haa literally just wants I mean
[00:25:18] okay I have to read her kit like I
[00:25:19] didn't make a guide for her so I didn't
[00:25:20] like look into it but for my
[00:25:22] understanding you just want speed and
[00:25:23] defensive stats on her like like a
[00:25:25] normal cuz you're just your Buffs don't
[00:25:27] scill on your St like outside of having
[00:25:29] good speed I don't think your Buffs
[00:25:31] matter like well your Buffs matter but
[00:25:32] they don't scill on like your attack or
[00:25:37] anything skills on speed yeah like
[00:25:39] that's the only side you [ __ ] want I
[00:25:41] guess a good min max are speed a bit
[00:25:42] more I could I could see I don't know
[00:25:44] maybe our like head and gloves suck but
[00:25:46] out out of that Los I love
[00:25:50] you actually I could check okay fine
[00:25:52] I'll check I'm I'll check um actually

[00:41:40] haa a broke whale what the [ __ ] I'm not
[00:41:43] a whale
[00:41:45] yo why does
[00:41:47] she chat be respectful why does she look
[00:41:50] like
[00:41:55] that
[00:42:05] while Devotion to public tasks is a must
[00:42:09] this fatigue is somewhat
[00:42:15] overwhelming is 70 fine do I need to 80
[00:42:18] here I I can 80 here if we need
[00:42:25] to
[00:42:28] uh lyone we're doing um this one for now
[00:42:32] I don't know actually I'm not sure we
[00:42:33] might give her Bron's Lon I haven't
[00:42:35] decided we'll just put this on her for
[00:42:36] now we'll figure it out later I could
[00:42:38] also um planetary rendevu but I'm not
[00:42:41] playing her with Argent I'm playing her
[00:42:42] on the other team I think so there's no
[00:42:44] real reason to go planetary also I don't
[00:42:45] feel like leveling that I'm going to
[00:42:47] level meshing cogs for tting Yun
[00:42:51] um maybe for her but I kind of I mean
[00:42:57] yeah I don't know
[00:43:00] maybe I have to put on one of the two
[00:43:02] I'm not leveling two meshing cogs I'll
[00:43:03] level it for one of the
[00:43:06] two actually I already leveled it did I
[00:43:08] did I already I feel like I leveled it
[00:43:09] oh no it's 50 only let me can finish
[00:43:11] leveling
[00:43:13] it
[00:43:19] uh I'm not leveling a second one I'm
[00:43:22] leveling one and my characters can fight
[00:43:24] over it I am not leveling two
[00:43:42] [ __ ] okay there you go we have one
[00:43:48] leveled anyways we can figure out who
[00:43:50] wears what after but for now let's level
[00:43:52] them so that they're usable and then
[00:43:53] we'll uh we'll build them and then yeah
[00:43:55] okay traces
[00:43:57] ah [ __ ] traces
[00:44:03] okay the lout looks so
[00:44:05] different I know it's cuz it's like
[00:44:07] erudition [ __ ] but like kind of cool to
[00:44:09] look at
[00:44:11] anyways
[00:44:12] okay time let's start with uh let's
[00:44:15] start with
[00:44:19] Argent there was night we made we're
[00:44:22] getting this Destiny will bring us we're
[00:44:25] getting this
[00:44:26] we're getting this we're getting
[00:44:30] this we're getting
[00:44:33] this we're getting
[00:44:35] this we're getting ah yes definitely
[00:44:38] getting that this is worth it but we'll
[00:44:40] wait a second before getting it just
[00:44:41] because I want to see how broke I am uh
[00:44:44] this we're getting we're going to level
[00:44:46] all of our talents keep it up
[00:44:54] br
[00:44:57] AR you're pretty but why does it sound
[00:44:58] Kona I think it sounds more AB Boba look
[00:45:00] look listen to
[00:45:03] him forgive me here we must part ways he
[00:45:07] sounds a bobo it's my duty and Destiny
[00:45:09] to Traverse the universe alone I'm sure
[00:45:14] but I have a preference for thick one
[00:45:16] and only is the name of my spaceship
[00:45:18] okay maybe he doesn't
[00:45:21] anyways so this gives us a bunch of crit
[00:45:23] raid by the way which is pretty insane
[00:45:26] isn't it up to like 25% at Town level 10
[00:45:29] or am I wrong could be wrong I think I'm
[00:45:31] right
[00:45:36] though does it matter if you put anel in
[00:45:38] S5 memories of the past or S5 meshing
[00:45:41] [ __ ] cuz I heard memories of the past
[00:45:45] uh I'm pretty sure if we're talking
[00:45:46] about I just never remember the Lode
[00:45:47] names but this one yeah memories of the
[00:45:49] past S5 it gives the same I'm pretty
[00:45:51] sure let me let me check well I have to
[00:45:54] look it up but I'm pretty sure it gives
[00:45:55] is the same it should be uh the same
[00:45:57] amount on
[00:45:59] hit the only thing meshing cogs does is
[00:46:01] if you get hit it gives you energy but I
[00:46:04] don't think you're trying to get hit I
[00:46:05] mean it
[00:46:07] happens but it should I don't think
[00:46:09] you're caling for that like I don't
[00:46:10] think your Cals of energy per rotation
[00:46:12] is assuming you get hit once cuz that's
[00:46:14] kind of
[00:46:19] inconsistent so it should be the same
[00:46:21] but if you have it S5 if you don't have
[00:46:22] it S5 then you go
[00:46:24] Cox
[00:46:30] it's on attacks as well both of them are
[00:46:31] on attacks but COA is also if you get
[00:46:38] hit but the thing is like the reason
[00:46:41] you're playing that is that you can
[00:46:42] burst every x amount of turns usually
[00:46:44] like two and so because of that you're
[00:46:47] you're caling like you're doing it so
[00:46:48] that you have enough energy without
[00:46:50] getting hit also cuz if you have to get
[00:46:52] hit then it becomes kind of weird and
[00:46:54] inconsistent
[00:46:57] but anyways
[00:46:59] um let's keep leveling these stuff oops
[00:47:02] traces um I need to level this
[00:47:06] too try to level this [ __ ] Basics at
[00:47:08] all I feel like I'm never going to
[00:47:12] basic um dude these [ __ ]
[00:47:16] mats we'll get this to
[00:47:20] eight this I want to get to nine because
[00:47:22] I get more crit rate and I want to have
[00:47:24] the max amount of crit rate just cuz
[00:47:25] crit XD so let me make some more I have
[00:47:29] more I just didn't like craft them all
[00:47:30] into
[00:47:33] purples let's make 15 purples or maybe L
[00:47:36] I don't know if I need the blues
[00:47:40] anymore we'll do this
[00:47:45] one crit value
[00:47:48] Andy
[00:47:49] true I mean I'm a damage Andy okay
[00:47:52] damage is nice even if it's attack
[00:47:54] percent uh ALT level is very nice as
[00:47:56] well but I kind of want to get more crit
[00:47:58] rate cuz this Stacks uh up to 10 times
[00:48:00] which is a lot of crit
[00:48:07] rate I will take that crit
[00:48:15] rate I'll take that crit rate okay we're
[00:48:17] going to leave him here for now we'll
[00:48:18] level more later broke on mats don't
[00:48:21] talk to me right oh I have no Harmony oh
[00:48:24] I just leveled [ __ ] okay no I have a
[00:48:25] I have it's just cuz I leveled a ly cone
[00:48:27] I leveled a l cone that's why I leveled
[00:48:28] a [ __ ] ly cone I actually leveled a
[00:48:30] ly cone calm down calm down dude calm
[00:48:32] down it's not funny calm the [ __ ] down
[00:48:34] calm
[00:48:43] down every stroke penned by a judge is
[00:48:47] tied to infinite karmic outcomes what
[00:48:49] did you yo she is yapping great
[00:48:53] care every stroke pend by a judge is
[00:48:57] tied to infinite karmic
[00:48:59] outcomes one must proceed I want this
[00:49:02] speed so bad I'm getting the speed I'm
[00:49:04] getting the speed you can't stop me you
[00:49:05] can't stop me you can't stop me give me
[00:49:06] the speed I need the HP cuz I feel like
[00:49:07] she's going to get [ __ ] if not uh give
[00:49:09] me the speed yep yep yep yep yep yep uh
[00:49:12] attack we could you know maybe HP cost
[00:49:15] [ __ ] six and then speak 12 12 you are
[00:49:19] [ __ ] me right now
[00:49:22] 12 wait yo why the [ __ ] would I level
[00:49:27] this this can suck my nuts it literally
[00:49:30] like the effect is really good but like
[00:49:32] I don't care about the damage this is
[00:49:34] the one I want to level yeah this one
[00:49:36] and uh this one as well
[00:49:48] okay tell me why Shang Ling should I get
[00:49:52] them to eight I'll level this cuz it
[00:49:54] costs literally nothing
[00:49:57] but the HP and speed are really valuable
[00:50:00] I think it's worth getting even if I'm
[00:50:01] broke on mats I think it's worth
[00:50:04] getting no I forgot okay wait wait wait
[00:50:08] wait wait wait wait wait let
[00:50:14] me wait wait this isn't a whale shop

[00:52:04] slot um
[00:52:07] okay where is haa let me get her to
[00:52:12] 75 we're not going to waste any XP none
[00:52:16] at all we're going to put the minimum
[00:52:18] amount she is now
[00:52:21] 75 and we can give her this
[00:52:23] speed then I'm going to get one of these
[00:52:26] I'm going to get both of them to eight
[00:52:27] so let me craft some more which we
[00:52:29] should be able to do boom and then boom
[00:52:33] we got eight which should be enough and
[00:52:35] then we also need wait which mat is it
[00:52:38] this
[00:52:39] one so I want six of these we'll do 10
[00:52:42] whatever doesn't matter we're going to
[00:52:44] get this to eight and then we're going
[00:52:45] to get this to eight okay good start
[00:52:48] good start now let's gear
[00:52:52] them yeah so this buff is flat
[00:52:56] right yeah and then this one is also
[00:52:59] just skill points and then this one
[00:53:00] skills on speed so we want to give her
[00:53:02] as much speed as
[00:53:06] possible uh but I should already have
[00:53:08] her gear on oh I don't have speed on
[00:53:10] this piece wait do I even have a speed
[00:53:11] piece yeah I do I do it's not what I do
[00:53:13] I do I do I have five five is definitely
[00:53:15] not enough five I mean five is okay five
[00:53:18] is
[00:53:19] fine no five is not fine [ __ ] it we're
[00:53:22] leveling this stop gearing badge listen
[00:53:25] I will find you and I will cook you in
[00:53:32] game that's objectively worse than this
[00:53:34] right no it has HP HP is not bad it also
[00:53:37] might roll h and has defense never mind
[00:53:39] that's better uh okay we're going to
[00:53:41] level this we're going to do this level
[00:53:43] it our GL we are going to do uh who the
[00:53:47] [ __ ] is it
[00:53:53] on I think I think it's yukong right
[00:53:56] where the [ __ ] is
[00:54:00] she why can't I the [ __ ] wait what is my
[00:54:04] body I don't oh yeah it's this one okay
[00:54:06] this one's [ __ ] I don't have one with
[00:54:07] speed I have boots though POG and then
[00:54:10] ball we're going to
[00:54:12] go actually wait wait wait let me make
[00:54:14] sure Argent is fine first so it'll be a
[00:54:16] lot
[00:54:22] simpler think I give him is it this one
[00:54:25] or is it this one what the [ __ ] is ew
[00:54:27] wait no wa wait which one is it is it
[00:54:29] this or is it oh no it's this one okay
[00:54:31] this one our Argent is good ARA we're
[00:54:34] going to have to craft a little cuz ARA
[00:54:37] kind of has I just put like whatever as
[00:54:38] a placeholder but I need to give her
[00:54:40] better stats probably uh Argent there's
[00:54:43] a argument to be made about not going
[00:54:46] crit raid body but I don't have a good
[00:54:48] crit damage one so we'll talk about that
[00:54:49] later ball we have
[00:54:52] inert I love balls and then we
[00:54:56] have uh I don't have a good Rope though
[00:54:59] my good rope am my decent ropes on imer
[00:55:01] are we going to play Emer today if we
[00:55:03] don't I could yink it from him if we do
[00:55:05] I'm going to have to use uh where is
[00:55:09] it wait where's my rope oh there it is
[00:55:11] this one which isn't good obviously 114
[00:55:13] HP
[00:55:21] XD yeah so um the thing is we're gaining
[00:55:26] crit rate but we're also gaining crit
[00:55:28] damage so
[00:55:30] technically
[00:55:34] technically technically we're gaining uh
[00:55:37] up to it depends on
[00:55:40] like like it gets higher throughout the
[00:55:42] fight well I mean you can stack it fast
[00:55:45] but we can gain up to technically 25
[00:55:49] crit
[00:55:50] rate all right is there other
[00:55:54] sources
[00:55:55] yeah
[00:55:59] 25 but we also get crit
[00:56:03] damage we also get crit damage with a
[00:56:07] broken kill so we're technically gaining
[00:56:09] 10 crit damage which still isn't one to
[00:56:11] two well if we get let's say we get 20
[00:56:13] like 85 to 165 is so like
[00:56:18] whatever so he should be fine uh the
[00:56:20] only thing is I wish some of our pieces
[00:56:22] were better I don't have a good crit
[00:56:23] damage body so I'm going for a good crit
[00:56:24] right which is good I'm going I have a
[00:56:26] really good hands but these are inators
[00:56:28] I stole them our gloves are good I mean
[00:56:30] our sorry our head is good and our boots
[00:56:31] are good our ball is amazing well decent
[00:56:34] well no it's really good and then our
[00:56:36] rope sucks balls but it's fine uh you
[00:56:39] can't win them all so it should be
[00:56:41] definitely good enough
[00:56:44] um I just don't know if we're playing in
[00:56:46] biter or BL I'm playing blade and jinglu
[00:56:48] for sure but I don't know if we're
[00:56:50] playing in B if we're not I can [ __ ] his
[00:56:52] artifact his relics a bit more
[00:56:58] but we're definitely playing
[00:57:00] her the only problem is I'm on Quantum
[00:57:03] which is really good if you run peer or
[00:57:05] silver wolf but I'm not going to be
[00:57:05] running peer or silver wolf so it's
[00:57:07] going to be a bit worse but it is what
[00:57:08] it
[00:57:09] is for AIA will'll give her should I
[00:57:13] actually optimize her or just put
[00:57:14] whatever on her
[00:57:16] um we'll level this we'll see how it
[00:57:18] goes we'll see how it goes and then
[00:57:19] we'll decide uh what can I
[00:57:23] throw
[00:57:25] wait don't I have like a leveled
[00:57:27] something I can throw let me
[00:57:31] see is this good yeah it's
[00:57:34] good we'll just Auto add we'll see see
[00:57:36] how it
[00:57:38] goes speed so far so
[00:57:41] good
[00:57:43] okay please please oh my
[00:57:48] God what the
[00:57:51] [ __ ] that's good dude defense isn't even
[00:57:54] bad on this set
[00:58:01] all right whatever I
[00:58:02] creamed one more one more one more
[00:58:04] please oh my [ __ ] okay we win GG we win
[00:58:08] we win we win 11 speed GG it's over it's
[00:58:11] [ __ ]
[00:58:12] J okay well we just got 11 speed there
[00:58:15] you go uh our hpps I leveled this cuz I
[00:58:18] thought it was funny it has like insane
[00:58:20] crit value so I was like it'll be funny
[00:58:22] obviously she doesn't want that but I
[00:58:23] just think it's funny uh um with that
[00:58:25] said I probably should go with one that
[00:58:27] has speed this one has four speed which
[00:58:29] is not a lot but it's better than zero
[00:58:31] speed um if I have a body that has a
[00:58:34] high speed substat I might level it I
[00:58:38] don't
[00:58:41] XD we'll just use this one um I don't
[00:58:44] want to give hoo this piece
[00:58:48] [Applause]
[00:58:51] though okay we'll we'll decide on the
[00:58:54] body later gloves we're going to
[00:58:56] go um gloves I definitely have with
[00:59:00] speed for sure I know I do yeah there's
[00:59:02] like one here one here one
[00:59:08] there which one's better
[00:59:11] speed this one has defense percent and
[00:59:14] attack percent which is good on like tun
[00:59:16] and [ __ ] we're going to level this
[00:59:19] one wait the glove is a duck oh my God
[00:59:22] it's a duck wait I didn't even notice
[00:59:23] that
[00:59:26] wait this is the best set in the
[00:59:28] game this is actually the best set in
[00:59:30] the
[00:59:31] game it's a [ __ ] duck defense is
[00:59:35] good speed is
[00:59:39] great uh this is good for tingyun
[00:59:41] honestly this is good for like tingyun
[00:59:43] we're still going to level it uh let me
[00:59:45] throw something into it though cuz we're
[00:59:46] running out of Relic XP I should have a
[00:59:48] piece that's like throw away this piece
[00:59:49] sucks don't talk to me about it but I'm
[00:59:51] going to keep it I said don't talk to me
[00:59:53] about it I would keep this but I'm not

[01:00:01] going to remove this yep and we're going
[01:00:03] to throw those into these uh
[01:00:05] gloves boom plus
[01:00:11] four I
[01:00:13] mean it's not bad dude def it's it's
[01:00:15] fine it's tanky I mean like characters
[01:00:18] can use this uh it's not like better
[01:00:20] than speed but it's okay it's fine uh
[01:00:23] it's okay it's fine
[01:00:25] can I use this yeah I can I'm going to
[01:00:27] keep that no it's
[01:00:28] an has
[01:00:30] speed actually no [ __ ] it I have better
[01:00:34] ones she's squishy it's fine I mean
[01:00:37] defense isn't bad I just would rather
[01:00:38] have speed we got speed okay cool we're
[01:00:41] actually pogging okay these two pieces
[01:00:43] are goated we have two goated pieces and
[01:00:45] boots are like it doesn't matter boots
[01:00:47] are fine even if they're mid cuz boots
[01:00:48] are
[01:00:50] boots uh which boots are hers is it this
[01:00:53] one 114 flat HP aware our body sucks
[01:00:57] though our body sucks and
[01:01:01] our so okay what twopiece do I feel like
[01:01:03] going I know you can go this one if you
[01:01:06] play her with Argentina I don't think
[01:01:08] I'm going to play her with Argentina I
[01:01:10] think I'm going to play her with blade
[01:01:13] and Jing Leu because she can buff both
[01:01:15] at the same
[01:01:16] time
[01:01:19] um so I think we're going to go for a
[01:01:21] set that Buffs our entire team ideally
[01:01:23] broken k because crit damage Buffs both
[01:01:26] uh Fleet of the AG lifts gives attack
[01:01:28] which is really good for jinglu and not
[01:01:31] amazing for blade like he can use attack
[01:01:32] a little but not as much so I think
[01:01:34] we're going broken Keel um the problem
[01:01:37] is there's only four speed here which
[01:01:38] isn't great like this ball substats are
[01:01:40] [ __ ]
[01:01:43] useless this one also is useless do I
[01:01:45] have a better one I have a few ER
[01:01:48] ropes wow none of them have speed I mean
[01:01:51] it's ER you can't
[01:01:53] dude
[01:01:55] whoa
[01:01:57] 11 wait but this is on oh but but dude
[01:02:01] no we have to take this 11 bro 11 we
[01:02:04] have to take this I'm sorry hoo I'm
[01:02:06] sorry I'm sorry we have to take this
[01:02:08] we're swapping sets we just swapped sets
[01:02:11] n say engulfing or Calamity for shin
[01:02:14] engulfing or Calamity for shha neither
[01:02:16] go
[01:02:16] [Laughter]
[01:02:21] Fab I thought he benched the game I told
[01:02:23] you I play we're just Auto Battle
[01:02:26] simulators wait this is actually crack
[01:02:28] though I'd rather have broken kill right
[01:02:29] now but I don't care 11 speed nine
[01:02:33] speed the only thing we have no speed on
[01:02:35] is our
[01:02:38] body should I go meshing
[01:02:41] [ __ ] uh we'll try we'll try both I
[01:02:47] think yeah we have so much
[01:02:51] speed holy [ __ ] wait wait wait wait I
[01:02:54] okay I'm going to get a B with speed now
[01:02:55] I don't care do I have one if I don't we
[01:02:57] might Farm it I'll Farm it off stream I
[01:02:59] guess but let's
[01:03:02] filter no oh yeah Mesa could be HP or
[01:03:05] defense HP is
[01:03:07] better right is it I don't actually
[01:03:10] know no we don't have one we have four
[01:03:13] speed that's all we can get I mean sure
[01:03:15] we'll take four speed
[01:03:21] yeah
[01:03:23] 194
[01:03:26] damn what does are um no we're not going
[01:03:29] to activate these even though These are
[01:03:31] nice but we're not going to activate
[01:03:32] this damn yo yo our supports are
[01:03:36] actually cracked look dude look at look
[01:03:38] this this okay ignore shut the [ __ ] up
[01:03:40] we have no speed on a ria right now shut

[01:03:46] this sorry sorry dude stop it's not
[01:03:51] my I could I just wanted to be slower

[01:04:32] Thunder
[01:04:37] dude I just don't think we can get 161
[01:04:40] that's only problem I don't think we can
[01:04:41] lap our blade that's the
[01:04:45] problem I don't think we can lap our
[01:04:47] blade is the
[01:04:53] problem
[01:04:58] but we can
[01:05:01] try this is so good holy [ __ ] but I
[01:05:03] think I'm giving this to my yeah it's on

[01:06:23] set
[01:06:24] [Music]
[01:06:31] [Music]

[01:06:38] four piece of Eagle I'm not sure what I
[01:06:41] want to do happy arent day Mr socks did
[01:06:44] you get him yet I just tuned
[01:06:47] in yes we just got
[01:06:49] him do I have effect res though I don't
[01:06:52] think I have enough effect res none the
[01:06:53] oh wait this pce does how much I
[01:07:00] have wait 43 I have
[01:07:03] enough okay we'll do
[01:07:06] this
[01:07:11] fine
[01:07:12] [Music]
[01:07:19] whoa this be sucks right I'll keep it
[01:07:24] I'll keep
[01:07:26] it no I'm not going to keep
[01:07:31] it sock why are you throwing away a plus
[01:07:34] 15 [ __ ] you
[01:07:37] sorry
[01:07:39] no I mean effector isn't bad but we want
[01:07:42] a crit damage for her I mean effector is
[01:07:45] fine effector is actually I have no XP a
[01:07:49] it's fine we'll do this don't you get
[01:07:50] the in this game they actually give you
[01:07:51] the [ __ ] back right it's not a waste
[01:07:55] yeah well that's good that's
[01:07:58] good
[01:08:02] deserved okay we're fine I mean we're
[01:08:04] not fine we need more speed we're
[01:08:06] actually not fine but it's okay like for
[01:08:08] now temporarily we're
[01:08:18] okay when said is bait not if your sub
[01:08:21] stats are really good which they are
[01:08:23] look at this look at this seven speed
[01:08:25] seven speed with crit
[01:08:27] damage okay this one's kind of mid but
[01:08:30] like we actually have really good Subs
[01:08:31] on it so I think it's worth because of
[01:08:34] our sub
[01:08:38] stats but I don't know if we might
[01:08:40] actually might be smarter to two-piece
[01:08:42] cuz we have good subsets on these and we
[01:08:44] could go two-piece speed and then
[01:08:45] that'll help a lot if we do like
[01:08:49] uh like not to disrespect our haa but
[01:08:52] let's say we end up on like this right
[01:08:53] right I don't even think we're playing
[01:08:55] bronia today by the way I don't know why
[01:08:56] I'm doing this but like just for example
[01:08:58] right for example we do this for example
[01:09:00] we do this how much speed is that I mean
[01:09:03] we only need 10 more which isn't
[01:09:05] actually hard to get cuz wait is it hard
[01:09:07] let me see yeah okay never mind it is
[01:09:09] hard to
[01:09:19] get what type of crack is he on chat
[01:09:23] what do you mean what yo yo what are you
[01:09:25] talking
[01:09:31] about anyways I don't think we're even
[01:09:33] playing BR cuz we're playing Argent with
[01:09:36] uh well either BR or tting Yun both are
[01:09:39] fine and then our other team is
[01:09:42] Blade with Jing
[01:09:45] Leu yeah wait our Bron is fine we're not
[01:09:47] playing her with blade anyways cuz we're
[01:09:49] playing Hana with blade cuz Okay the
[01:09:51] point here's what I was cooking with Han
[01:09:53] here's what I was thinking okay let me
[01:09:54] know if you're on the same page if
[01:09:56] you're on a different page I was
[01:09:57] thinking okay hear me out so haa here's
[01:09:59] what she does okay she gives you skill
[01:10:02] point wow skill point tasty but
[01:10:06] also she'll give uh damage
[01:10:10] percent on whatever Target is
[01:10:12] marked so cool which means you're going
[01:10:15] to get more damage for your whatever
[01:10:17] carries you run and if we're running
[01:10:18] blade and Jing Le it's going to buff
[01:10:20] both but also one character will get a
[01:10:25] ton of
[01:10:26] speed and a bunch of attack so we can
[01:10:30] give attack and speed to our attack
[01:10:31] scaling character and then damage to our
[01:10:33] HP scaling
[01:10:35] character I don't know if we need
[01:10:37] meshing Cox though we can try it out I
[01:10:39] don't know are we too squishy what's our
[01:10:41] HP no that's actually not bad we're
[01:10:44] actually fine okay we'll try this out uh
[01:10:47] let me make sure tingyun is not tingyun
[01:10:48] is usually on meshing Coxs but we're
[01:10:50] going to put it on this and then hope we
[01:10:52] get the uh
[01:10:55] um wait
[01:10:57] no yeah we're going to get it on this
[01:10:59] and it'll be
[01:11:00] fine yeah it'll be actually
[01:11:04] fine I probably should go HP body but
[01:11:06] we'll do that later okay we'll be okay
[01:11:09] okay let me try
[01:11:22] them
[01:11:26] so these are going to be our teams I
[01:11:27] think we're going to play Argent with uh
[01:11:30] let's say either tingyun or BR I don't
[01:11:32] know yet but let's say tingyun or both
[01:11:35] technically but let's say
[01:11:39] this no no not Lua let's say
[01:11:42] this and then the other team's going to
[01:11:49] be
[01:11:51] this this and Lua
[01:11:54] probably this is going to be our
[01:11:57] team
[01:12:00] uh you ungeared oh I don't did I I
[01:12:04] thought I ungeared
[01:12:06] fushan too many characters to gear oh
[01:12:10] yeah she's only on two
[01:12:14] piece wait why is T on HP the
[01:12:19] [ __ ] too many characters too little time
[01:12:31] wait someone else has my
[01:12:32] body oh that's
[01:12:35] why I could two dce yeah yeah F Run's
[01:12:38] gear not her okay I'll do be D for now
[01:12:42] okay this is fine do I have enough
[01:12:43] effect
[01:12:45] res yeah we do
[01:12:50] okay uh I think we're fine then okay let
[01:12:54] me try in

[01:17:26] get I need to start playing okay so
[01:17:28] we're going to start playing we're going
[01:17:29] to start
[01:17:30] playing
[01:17:33] um we'll go what should we do first
[01:17:36] memory chaos maybe or should we do
[01:17:37] simulated Universe first uh why am I
[01:17:41] clicking on random
[01:17:43] things mock okay we could do some mock
[01:17:46] we can do some
[01:17:52] mock
[01:17:54] I saved it here so we can do A910
[01:17:55] together I just Auto battled these well
[01:17:57] not Auto yeah Auto Battle and then A910
[01:17:59] we can do
[01:18:02] together we'll be counting
[01:18:07] [Music]
[01:18:09] stars why are none of them weak to
[01:18:13] physical or Quantum so I can't even
[01:18:15] implant it with silver
[01:18:17] wolf this guy weak to Quantum no
[01:18:19] literally I mean this guy's weak to
[01:18:21] physical
[01:18:26] he's so
[01:18:33] beautiful wait till 10 we'll wait till
[01:18:38] 10 uh okay we have to decide if we're
[01:18:41] playing BR or tingyun chat who should
[01:18:43] who do you want me to play with Argent
[01:18:45] so this is our team it's Argent A Healer
[01:18:48] a nihility and then either BR or kyun
[01:18:51] both I think are good here we could Al
[01:18:53] play I think this is also a team we
[01:18:55] could also do both but I think we're
[01:18:56] going to do one to
[01:18:57] Hil tting Yun everyone saying tingyun
[01:19:00] okay needs to un for energy energy is
[01:19:02] very nice to them I agree we got I mean
[01:19:04] h also getes energy I think you could do
[01:19:08] this team though or we could do two
[01:19:11] carries
[01:19:13] technically but okay we'll do this and
[01:19:15] then last thought will be in theil one
[01:19:17] of the two and then our other team will
[01:19:18] also have Anil our other team is going
[01:19:19] to be blady jinglu haa cuz we want to
[01:19:23] play both haa okay we need to listen we
[01:19:26] need to play Argent te haa cuz they're
[01:19:28] new and W ho cuz W ho everyone else
[01:19:32] replaceable so we're going to do this
[01:19:33] we're going to put tingu here and then
[01:19:37] who ho will be last our next character
[01:19:40] is going to be uh is P I think PE is
[01:19:43] geared we'll check after I'm pretty sure
[01:19:45] she's geared and then second half we're
[01:19:47] going to have blade jinglu
[01:19:51] haa
[01:19:55] laa do I have it I
[01:19:59] do is Hana not good for Argent she's
[01:20:01] fine with Argent t uh because you can
[01:20:04] the main Synergy she has with
[01:20:07] him in my
[01:20:09] opinion uh one of the better synergies
[01:20:12] is that you can run uh planetary which
[01:20:14] gives you physical damage bonus
[01:20:16] especially with uh super positions and
[01:20:18] then her her her uh abilities just gives
[01:20:21] you Buffs but what like is because she
[01:20:24] Buffs she can buff two characters Bas
[01:20:26] well she can buff all the damage you do
[01:20:29] with this and then buff one character
[01:20:31] additionally and give you skill points
[01:20:34] which kind of makes it um oh yeah and
[01:20:36] and yeah yeah also I want to add on top
[01:20:38] of planetary you can also do this in
[01:20:40] case you're wondering this also is nice
[01:20:42] with another physical CU you can run
[01:20:45] penon land of the dreams for physical
[01:20:47] and then uh me whatever the [ __ ]
[01:20:48] planetary rendo but uh I was thinking
[01:20:52] this Buffs multiple like sorry this
[01:20:54] Buffs one character this Buffs
[01:20:55] everything and then you also get skill
[01:20:57] points so I feel like using her with
[01:20:59] like two characters that can can
[01:21:01] actually be maybe good I don't know I
[01:21:02] haven't tried it yet like this could be
[01:21:03] terrible we don't know yet we're
[01:21:05] experimenting together I haven't tried
[01:21:07] this before so let's get this 11 months
[01:21:09] but this looks like in theory this
[01:21:10] should be
[01:21:12] good and then Lu is very skill point
[01:21:15] efficient and if this team uh
[01:21:18] yeah so let me just make sure everyone's
[01:21:20] geared
[01:21:21] Lua perfect timing uh you know relics we
[01:21:25] on musketeer and Fleet of the Ageless
[01:21:28] obviously oh I don't have
[01:21:31] a wait it's kind of I mean it's fine
[01:21:33] it's good enough we don't need to
[01:21:34] optimize him he's like good with nothing
[01:21:36] it's fine I probably could fix this
[01:21:38] build but it doesn't matter do I have
[01:21:40] enough yeah yeah we're fine Han's on 194
[01:21:43] speed I don't know if meshing cogs is
[01:21:47] needed but we're going to try it I think
[01:21:48] it is but we'll try it Jing Le is
[01:21:51] cracked of course but she is on four
[01:21:54] quantum which you shouldn't do if you're
[01:21:55] not running peer silver wolf but I'm not
[01:21:57] changing my build so don't talk to me
[01:21:59] right now but it's actually not bad with
[01:22:00] their like so it's fine uh blade cracked
[01:22:04] gigachad blade low speed though but
[01:22:05] outside of that very good uh
[01:22:09] hoo
[01:22:14] pil no it's fine it's fine it's fine
[01:22:16] it's fine it's fine it's paila who cares
[01:22:19] it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine
[01:22:23] it's fine it's fine it's fine I could go
[01:22:27] broken kill and say [ __ ] you br yeah
[01:22:29] [ __ ] you br we're not playing BR with yo
[01:22:30] BR stuff okay we're on [ __ ] broken
[01:22:33] kill now and we have enough effect res
[01:22:37] no we don't what the [ __ ] what the
[01:22:44] [ __ ] mods anyone that types gearing ban
[01:22:48] them and then and then find them and ban
[01:22:50] them again in game
[01:22:59] do I have enough effect res I do 39.8 GG
[01:23:02] okay we're chilling our p is
[01:23:09] [Music]
[01:23:13] chilling all right I think we're ready
[01:23:16] uh Ting Yun is on I don't have mesh two
[01:23:18] meshing cogs I only have one so we're on
[01:23:20] but the battle isn't over I'm still on
[01:23:22] slightly vwac which I think if I'm not
[01:23:24] running meshing cogs actually doesn't do
[01:23:27] enough unless we get hit so I probably
[01:23:29] shouldn't be on on slightly vwac but it
[01:23:31] is what it is
[01:23:34] um I think I'm going to go in HP body so
[01:23:36] she doesn't die what's her HP total
[01:23:38] 4,200 she might die I kind of want to go
[01:23:40] in HP body
[01:23:43] um but I think I need to just hurry up
[01:23:46] before people start saying oh play the
[01:23:48] game so I think we're just going to play
[01:23:50] the
[01:23:50] game um
[01:23:53] she scales on attack are you dumb of
[01:23:56] course she scales on attack but if she
[01:23:57] dies what the [ __ ] does it
[01:24:00] matter I'm going to go speed
[01:24:03] boots uh do I have speed boots I
[01:24:16] don't that'll be fine we have over 138
[01:24:20] it'll be okay yeah we're chilling and
[01:24:21] then our okay Argent this is the only
[01:24:23] character that matters okay our Argent
[01:24:26] this is going to be for the whole stream
[01:24:27] this is what he's on okay we're on heo
[01:24:29] con don't talk to me don't I know it's
[01:24:31] not the best but it's what we have and
[01:24:33] it's okay it's decent it's not great but
[01:24:35] it's okay stop talking to me it's like
[01:24:37] on par with some four stars it's fine
[01:24:39] worse than the battle pass but better
[01:24:41] than like a few other four stars if you
[01:24:43] can weakness break it's okay it's
[01:24:44] actually okay it's okay on average it
[01:24:47] mats out to be okay it's not like the
[01:24:49] highest it's not the lowest it's okay
[01:24:51] all right it's a bad five star St but it
[01:24:53] is what it is we have it okay uh we are
[01:24:57] on two bees two bees cuz I don't have a
[01:24:58] good uh physical set but even then two
[01:25:00] two is very similar like TB is not bad
[01:25:03] um so we're on TB two with inert Salo we
[01:25:05] have a a pretty good flow uh I can't
[01:25:08] said flower pretty good head pretty good
[01:25:10] hands um pretty good body except we
[01:25:13] would want crit damage but it's fine uh
[01:25:15] and good boots inert Sal soda we have a
[01:25:18] really good ball and our rope sucks so
[01:25:20] I'm going to steal that hungs
[01:25:23] and uh yeah so pretty decent the only
[01:25:25] thing is we gain about 20 crit rate well
[01:25:27] up to 25 which is a lot which means
[01:25:30] let's say we gain 20 70 plus 20 is 90 so
[01:25:33] we can have over 90 crit rate but we
[01:25:35] also gain 10 crit damage with broken
[01:25:37] kill on a support still over crit rate
[01:25:40] to crit we would like to have more crit
[01:25:41] damage but I'm going based on sub stat
[01:25:43] so this is what I can get all right it's
[01:25:45] fine we're e zero we don't have a
[01:25:46] signature so we'll see how he what
[01:25:48] happens and then our haa is full speed
[01:25:51] with some like you know
[01:25:54] HP so yeah hopefully we might get more
[01:25:57] crit damage on him
[01:26:00] but we can't right now uh I don't have
[01:26:02] silver wolf in my team do I have the
[01:26:04] skill points to spare for silver wolf no
[01:26:06] but she pea debuffs and AOE and Argent
[01:26:09] is AOE so we're going to use
[01:26:12] pilo all right I'm ready are you ready

[01:31:19] now we're playing this half I haven't
[01:31:20] actually tried haa yet so this is going
[01:31:22] to
[01:31:26] be sorry this is going to be uh fun and
[01:31:29] interesting so we're going to do uh Lua

[01:31:48] fine wait so she's already marked right
[01:31:50] that's what our technique does yeah so
[01:31:52] do we even need to use our skill I don't
[01:31:54] think we do although it could help us

[01:31:58] basic and then we'll skill next turn you

[01:35:32] go why you kill before burst I don't
[01:35:34] know I wanted to [ __ ] you yeah we should
[01:35:37] have bursted first but it's
[01:35:39] okay sh aled first so we got the energy
[01:35:42] and [ __ ] okay fine but that was only
[01:35:44] eight nine and 10 matter it doesn't
[01:35:45] matter uh okay why are you listen I have
[01:35:49] a question chat why are you guys flaming
[01:35:51] okay
[01:35:53] look listen we
[01:35:57] get we get 26% damage how much is this
[01:36:00] Max 30 30% damage 20% of haa speed and
[01:36:05] 57% attack for one Target and this is
[01:36:08] for two Targets why the [ __ ] wouldn't we
[01:36:10] run her with two carries I mean like we
[01:36:12] could also just go
[01:36:13] BR but like I feel like even if you
[01:36:15] don't need the skill points that's a lot
[01:36:17] of stats for Two
[01:36:19] Carries bronia gives you a lot though
[01:36:21] cuz bronia lets you go twice but you
[01:36:23] also need uh I don't
[01:36:28] know you need to have the skill
[01:36:33] points but Bron is also a five star that
[01:36:36] you're probably using your other team we
[01:36:37] could also try Hana with emiter we do
[01:36:42] this uh and then we're playing this guy
[01:36:44] first half we're playing the same team
[01:36:45] first half I
[01:36:50] think
[01:37:04] uh wait what did we play played
[01:37:07] [Music]
[01:37:09] P so relics yeah but he he's just
[01:37:12] missing one I think uh like his current
[01:37:14] build is not even that bad right yeah
[01:37:16] it's still fine he's just missing one
[01:37:19] Relic we could TR it wait oops I didn't
[01:37:23] mean to do
[01:37:36] that we could play this team this team
[01:37:39] looks fine
[01:37:42] too I don't think there's a reason to
[01:37:45] not play BR ever but I'm saying outside
[01:37:47] of BR this is probably
[01:37:50] good
[01:37:53] or we could
[01:37:58] do like Hana
[01:38:03] BR but I don't know if I want to do
[01:38:06] that also we could try BR with Argent
[01:38:08] where we just go twice so that we like
[01:38:11] obviously tingyun gives you energy but
[01:38:12] BR technically gives you energy if you
[01:38:14] get to go twice like you just act
[01:38:20] twice arion's not speed tuned
[01:38:23] though uh we want her to
[01:38:27] go I mean wait this is yeah this is fine
[01:38:31] we wanted to go right before our carry
[01:38:33] because of this so we want to do Ting
[01:38:35] Yun and then
[01:38:37] Argent just our H sometimes overlaps I
[01:38:40] think we'll
[01:38:45] see well actually we might want more
[01:38:47] speed cuz of our uh this
[01:38:56] H we'll figure it
[01:39:00] out okay we'll try this out see what
[01:39:02] happens uh just going to make sure
[01:39:04] emitor has the right uh I think he's
[01:39:07] fine like this piece isn't the right one
[01:39:09] but like I don't think it really matters
[01:39:11] it's not that big of a deal uh we'll
[01:39:13] just go like we'll go this lose out on
[01:39:15] some crit damage get some crit rate and
[01:39:16] attack and then um we'll [ __ ] our
[01:39:20] argent's a

[01:40:17] fine give me
[01:40:19] strength my oath is to a solid
[01:40:21] is

[01:48:50] of the Lord's decree hereby orain I
[01:48:54] don't know why I didn't skill last turn

[01:49:24] like a lot of charact guys are hitting
[01:49:25] at once the death shad's not that
[01:49:26] important actually no it is but it's not
[01:49:30] pil might be better
[01:49:32] too I mean it's too late we're already
[01:49:34] here but maybe next round who's going

[01:50:06] H give it up this guy's almost dead uh
[01:50:09] I'm going to skill him
[01:50:11] instead inevit by the will of the 10 the
[01:50:15] 10 Lord's decree hereby
[01:50:18] orain thinking too hard yeah I mean I
[01:50:20] could probably Auto Battle this
[01:50:23] but
[01:50:26] for this is double speed paila or I
[01:50:29] think paila like any form of AOE would
[01:50:31] have been a lot better here pail instead
[01:50:32] of Silver Wolf or even like Ting Yu and
[01:50:34] or bronia for a buff but it's okay not
[01:50:37] to be a hindsight
[01:50:41] hairy
[01:50:49] awaken
[01:50:53] this is serious I shall be the judge
[01:50:56] it's
[01:50:57] fine I'll see you
[01:51:01] off [ __ ] you didn't say
[01:51:05] it can I have fun this
[01:51:09] time still in the
[01:51:11] rec by the will of the 10 Lord the 10
[01:51:14] Lord's decree hereby
[01:51:18] orain
[01:51:21] is it jover it is jover [ __ ] finally
[01:51:24] okay
[01:51:25] easy easy now we have one [ __ ] floor
[01:51:29] left 10 which is japar and swarm wow I
[01:51:33] hecking love the Swarm they're both weak
[01:51:36] to um actually no the japar and the
[01:51:39] other dude these guys are weak to
[01:51:40] physical which is going to be easy so
[01:51:41] we'll play them we'll play Argent T
[01:51:43] first half be nice second half we'll
[01:51:45] play um maybe jinglu maybe
[01:51:51] Ander probably Jing but I think both are
[01:51:57] fine all right
[01:52:01] POG sely out of the dungeons chat my
[01:52:04] sely yo my yo yo yo we listen she is
[01:52:15] listen she's not benched per se she's
[01:52:18] just taking a short time off that's all
[01:52:21] she's taking a break dude let her take a
[01:52:24] break what's wrong with breaks they're
[01:52:30] healthy yo pil is [ __ ] broken here
[01:52:33] you can literally break
[01:52:38] everything we could play this Loki can
[01:52:41] Loki do that
[01:52:45] Loki or we could just wait what about
[01:52:48] like this
[01:52:55] cuz I want to play Hana like I know we
[01:52:56] could BR
[01:53:01] but we could also do just
[01:53:06] like let do
[01:53:13] this give haa to argentin no that would
[01:53:15] be a Ab it would be a waste if I don't
[01:53:17] change my build if I give her the like
[01:53:18] physical buffing things yeah if not I
[01:53:20] don't see the
[01:53:23] point compared to the other team unless
[01:53:25] we're playing Two Carries which we might
[01:53:26] we could we could do a two carry team
[01:53:39] but I kind of want to try this team but
[01:53:42] I don't know if it would
[01:53:45] succeed our first half is definitely
[01:53:48] going
[01:53:51] I think our first half has to
[01:53:56] be the same the same team I think I
[01:53:58] think it has to be this second half we
[01:54:00] can
[01:54:01] decide okay Chad I have to [ __ ] pee I
[01:54:04] beb can you me for your let you guys
[01:54:07] watch something while I go should I just

[01:55:23] Limestone

[01:55:37] to bring out the whole
[01:55:40] ocean tell him to bring out the whole

[01:55:48] ocean
[01:55:52] tell him to bring out the whole
[01:55:58] ocean tell him to bring out the whole
[01:56:07] ocean tell him to bring out the whole
[01:56:13] ocean tell her to bring out the whole
[01:56:16] ocean you think it's a game huh
[01:56:22] tell to bring out the whole
[01:56:40] ocean let's go Goin God
[01:56:45] D I've been playing every day just
[01:56:48] perfecting my game you know
[01:56:53] and easy I'm
[01:56:56] back nice and
[01:57:01] easy
[01:57:03] goodness why are you guys mad that I'm
[01:57:05] back bro what the [ __ ] why are you guys
[01:57:09] dude dude you're supposed to be
[01:57:18] happy
[01:57:20] okay while I was peeing I've decided I'm
[01:57:21] playing this team uh cuz I want to and
[01:57:24] you can't tell me otherwise so [ __ ]
[01:57:29] you we're going to play this for now
[01:57:31] we'll try it and then if it doesn't work
[01:57:32] we'll play like a more meta team like
[01:57:34] maybe emiter with H or something now you
[01:57:36] might be like Z why are you playing Han
[01:57:38] in a team that doesn't need skill points
[01:57:39] listen you buff both characters with a
[01:57:41] damage bonus because you deal more
[01:57:42] damage
[01:57:43] and you give everyone uh you give your
[01:57:46] jingl speed and attack so it's a good
[01:57:48] alternative if you don't have like a
[01:57:50] bron available or even I mean p could
[01:57:51] work there too so yeah
[01:57:54] cool I think our healer is going to
[01:57:56] change though I think we'll put Lea on
[01:57:58] [Applause]
[01:57:59] the cuz we don't we can use this healer
[01:58:02] that uses skill points like it's okay to
[01:58:03] spam skill on our healer but we don't
[01:58:05] like we're kind of a we kind of have
[01:58:08] every five star
[01:58:10] [Music]
[01:58:18] so
[01:58:20] we could use fushan yeah we
[01:58:23] could fushan gives you some crit which
[01:58:26] is nice but I don't know if she's Ed

[02:02:31] Argent aled but um I like to Al in the
[02:02:34] same turn in case there's any Buffs that
[02:02:35] expire at the end of the turn so I
[02:02:36] usually alt when I can but yeah anyways
[02:02:38] it's fine doesn't matter again uh we're
[02:02:41] going to normal here and then
[02:02:43] alt your Devils I'll crush them it's
[02:02:47] fine we'll do better next one uh I'm
[02:02:49] going to Al
[02:02:49] [Music]
[02:02:52] here then we're going to skill and then
[02:02:54] we should get enough energy
[02:02:56] etal I got it right I'm pretty sure I
[02:02:57] got it prot
[02:03:00] Beauty oh I didn't bro it was literally
[02:03:03] full it was full it looked
[02:03:10] full how much energy did I have I did
[02:03:12] the level one okay if you're Wonder
[02:03:14] there's two bursts there's a level one
[02:03:15] and a level two I tried it I know the
[02:03:17] icon changes but I have to determine
[02:03:19] before the turn ended in case there was
[02:03:20] any Buffs that expired we were missing
[02:03:22] like three energy or something okay it's
[02:03:24] fine it's okay it is what it
[02:03:26] is I'm not going to reset I'm going to
[02:03:29] be
[02:03:30] relatable ouch that
[02:03:37] hurts give me strength enemy data
[02:03:42] secur why am I it doesn't matter I have
[02:03:45] Infinite
[02:03:46] Energy I'm going to make sure I have
[02:03:48] enough skill points here
[02:03:58] here ready for
[02:04:03] another let's be friends please die okay
[02:04:10] cool thousand
[02:04:14] wonders distance
[02:04:16] is I'm scared
[02:04:20] put wait I'm thinking we want to peel
[02:04:24] alt before we Argent the
[02:04:27] alt but the only way to do that is if we
[02:04:29] wo Al which is going to waste some
[02:04:31] energy on him but I
[02:04:33] think you can't play dead standing
[02:04:44] up we're just going to do it or Devils
[02:04:48] I'll crush them enemy secure yeah we
[02:04:50] also get the attack boost which is true
[02:04:53] let do this
[02:05:00] this then I'm actually going to hit J
[02:05:02] hard
[02:05:04] here enemy targets
[02:05:09] detect on
[02:05:17] my
[02:05:23] yeah our pil is not fully optimized she
[02:05:24] should have more speed but that's okay I
[02:05:27] don't think we need it for like memory
[02:05:29] chaos
[02:05:30] solve um we're going to skill and then P
[02:05:34] alss support
[02:05:37] wait yeah ready
[02:05:41] for
[02:05:44] counter okay this is fine this is fine
[02:05:47] no okay this is last fine please don't
[02:05:50] hit P ouch it's
[02:05:55] okay should have a bit more speed but we
[02:05:57] can fix that wait did the
[02:06:01] icon I thought the icon changed yo yo
[02:06:09] I how much energy do we have why does it
[02:06:12] look full bro it actually looks full I
[02:06:14] swear you can type copium all you want
[02:06:17] it literally looks full
[02:06:19] it literally looks full it literally
[02:06:21] looks full sorry I see The Jug as half
[02:06:24] full rather than half empty okay
[02:06:28] sorry it literally looked
[02:06:31] full whatever it's fine I'm not
[02:06:34] resetting I'm not
[02:06:35] resetting how does burst work if it gets
[02:06:38] level two it does more so like you'll
[02:06:40] see I'll get it level two here look look
[02:06:42] at the icon it's going to change when
[02:06:43] it's like when he hits 180 energy
[02:06:45] there's a second burst see it like it
[02:06:46] blooms I thought it did okay okay maybe
[02:06:49] I [ __ ] missed it maybe I missed
[02:06:53] it I'm sorry don't make fun of me o
[02:06:59] o let's go we'll do another clear after
[02:07:02] so that you don't think it's a skill

[02:12:00] last time he was one HP so now I'm stuck
[02:12:02] here um cuz like I could skill but then
[02:12:05] it's wasted
[02:12:07] energy I wonder what's better like I

[02:12:55] I just wanted to too easy brighten my
[02:12:58] day with your content thank you wa there
[02:13:01] are $20 jjx what the hell for being you
[02:13:05] appreciate
[02:13:06] it there you go we did it m c 10 two
[02:13:08] cycles remaining extra on top of the
[02:13:10] three star very easy very easy that
[02:13:13] second team has like too many skill
[02:13:15] points but over the damage of it is
[02:13:16] pretty good but I'm sure you could just
[02:13:17] like
[02:13:18] change everything in that team uh I have
[02:13:21] to do that [ __ ] memory thing too I
[02:13:22] might do that
[02:13:23] today let me claim these so I don't
[02:13:30] forget thanks for $20 means a lot
[02:13:38] legit damn
[02:13:45] POG blade flop you flop don't ever say
[02:13:48] that again to blade blade is actually
[02:13:50] cracked and very strong but in that team
[02:13:52] he serves as like hyper Bloom he's bonus
[02:13:54] damage that you're not even trying to
[02:13:55] get because you're mostly buffing your
[02:13:56] jinglu with haa even if the skill points
[02:13:58] aren't needed you're mostly buffing her
[02:14:00] with this uh and also this but uh blade
[02:14:03] gets bonus Buffs from this so it's just
[02:14:05] bonus damage you don't even like need to
[02:14:07] think about yeah you can run a bronie on
[02:14:08] that team you can run a p you can run a
[02:14:09] silver wolf you can run a Ting Yun sure
[02:14:12] okay and you could hyper carry on jinglu
[02:14:13] but blade is literally a bonus source of
[02:14:14] damage being buffed by this as well true
[02:14:16] low w
[02:14:19] also he helps her trigger her thing cuz
[02:14:21] the followup attack true or whatever the
[02:14:23] [ __ ] it let me read it again it's been a
[02:14:25] while the [ __ ] uh the [ __ ] fall
[02:14:28] attack thing where the [ __ ] is it where
[02:14:30] the [ __ ] is the fall attack buff thing
[02:14:32] where the [ __ ] is it I will find it
[02:14:33] that's the wait I will find it I will
[02:14:35] find it it's in here I know it's in here
[02:14:36] I know it's in here I will find
[02:14:46] it whatever she
[02:14:48] with with the follow attacks he'll do
[02:14:49] more damage basically so he has Synergy
[02:14:52] I just don't remember what the [ __ ] it
[02:14:53] is I have to read everything
[02:14:58] again yeah
[02:15:05] [Music]
[02:15:07] yeah oh it's the HP yeah you get more
[02:15:11] attack for the HP consume that's what it
[02:15:12] is okay true but then I'm pretty sure
[02:15:14] there's also something else it's been a
[02:15:17] while since I looked at the Jing one
[02:15:21] sec
[02:15:23] yeah yeah
[02:15:28] yeah yeah she consumes which lets blade
[02:15:31] that's it so here you consume HP which
[02:15:33] lets Blade full up attack more on top of
[02:15:35] that you
[02:15:36] also uh uh gain attack for the HP you
[02:15:39] consume but that doesn't matter I mean
[02:15:41] that always matters that's all you
[02:15:42] always get that but yeah you just like
[02:15:44] suck his HP
[02:15:46] true
[02:15:52] okay I don't know why that was so hard
[02:15:54] for me to remember it's been a while I R
[02:15:56] her abilities all right there you
[02:15:58] go do you want to enter do you want to
[02:16:01] enter yo I should buy some of
[02:16:07] these guide maker I didn't make a
[02:16:09] fulling new guide so I actually looked
[02:16:11] into her
[02:16:12] L surely I will look into Ruan may maybe
[02:16:15] but I look in the past like three
[02:16:17] characters I've been less less like
[02:16:19] intense on so he
[02:16:24] listen give me a little grace period
[02:16:26] okay you could be nice to me for like a
[02:16:27] month give me a little grace
[02:16:40] period you don't how you say I don't
[02:16:42] play I'm T [ __ ]
[02:16:46] 70 I okay I actually play every day I'm
[02:16:48] just an auto battle Andy I think it's
[02:16:50] less satisfying to min max in this game
[02:16:53] but I still do it like I still look into
[02:16:55] it I still try to but it's like less
[02:16:57] like I feel the value less cuz I'm Auto
[02:16:58] battling more than like genin that's the
[02:17:01] only difference like as long as my
[02:17:03] characters like kill [ __ ] I'm
[02:17:10] happy so like it feels less satisfying
[02:17:12] to have like the perfect like crit value
[02:17:14] and [ __ ] what if we do a path of
[02:17:16] Darkness okay let's do a maybe simulated
[02:17:19] universe but first let's do this
[02:17:22] copium why' you copium me RA this 7
[02:17:26] months can we see your argentini build
[02:17:29] sure our argenti is on night on the
[02:17:31] Milky Way don't laugh I know looking
[02:17:34] better right now don't laugh uh talents
[02:17:36] are level eight and nine uh relics are
[02:17:38] twopiece twopiece with iner Salo uh we
[02:17:41] have a good flower uh uh uh head good
[02:17:44] hands great body but it's crit rate
[02:17:46] obviously crit damage is more
[02:17:47] recommendable for most people cuz you
[02:17:48] get crit rate uh from your talent but it
[02:17:50] is what it is uh speed with a lot of
[02:17:52] crit damage boots uh physical sphere and
[02:17:55] then an attack rope that kind of sucks
[02:17:56] but it is what it is overall quite good
[02:17:58] although we get more crit rate than our
[02:17:59] crit damage should be we should have
[02:18:01] more crit rate uh more crit damage but
[02:18:03] it's still fine good build overall ezo
[02:18:05] of

[02:29:59] Z's we watch TV gameplay and in Star ra
[02:30:02] we watch Auto Battle gam players if we
[02:30:04] are watching
[02:30:07] TV uh I can't lie that was kind of
[02:30:12] cringe uh fact res is no ah we only have
[02:30:15] 30 surely it's going to be
[02:30:18] worth that was not the worth at all uh
[02:30:21] none of these are good
[02:30:22] but maybe we'll get the card that turns
[02:30:25] our ultimate into fall up
[02:30:29] attack is z cubed good never call it z
[02:30:33] cubed again it's pretty
[02:30:40] fun protect all Beauty
[02:30:45] recount
[02:30:49] are devils I'll crush them all I'll
[02:30:53] crush them all wow all of
[02:31:15] them
[02:31:17] I will protect all Beauty I shall be the
[02:31:20] judge the 10 Lords decree hereby
[02:31:26] or
[02:31:33] 3z protect all Beauty okay we protect
[02:31:36] all
[02:31:45] Beauty
[02:32:03] yeah uh I don't know why twitch vods
[02:32:05] have ads there is a a channel that
[02:32:07] re-uploads my vods though so there you
[02:32:09] go I guess I guess I'll talk about this
[02:32:11] now cuz this guy watches all my content
[02:32:13] anyways so uh it like I want to make a V
[02:32:16] channel so I could make that one
[02:32:17] official but the problem is if I do that
[02:32:19] then I'd have to like be mindful of what
[02:32:22] they post in case like I would have to
[02:32:24] have a bit of control like not a lot
[02:32:25] like they just still re up stuff but
[02:32:27] like you
[02:32:28] know beaut um
[02:32:36] yeah are devil and it's
[02:32:39] like I
[02:32:42] could but the thing is I so I was going
[02:32:44] to initially make one
[02:32:46] like on my own I was just going to make
[02:32:48] one and then have someone reupload it
[02:32:49] but then it's like well if there's one
[02:32:51] that already exists we could just use
[02:32:52] that one if they're down which I know
[02:32:54] they are but then the problem is I would
[02:32:56] have to like like for not format it but
[02:32:59] like you know like link it to stuff so
[02:33:01] people know it's official
[02:33:05] um and then yeah whatever else goes into
[02:33:10] it I will protect all
[02:33:15] Beauty
[02:33:17] give me cuz like I don't care about the
[02:33:18] money it generates cuz like I don't care
[02:33:20] it's just a VOD so like like if I make
[02:33:22] it up by
[02:33:23] myself uh it would take effort but that
[02:33:27] would be like monetized or whatever and
[02:33:28] then if someone else makes it well then
[02:33:29] they can keep like I don't know like 70%
[02:33:31] whatever the [ __ ] is normal cuz like I
[02:33:33] don't care about the money it makes but
[02:33:35] like it's good for people that don't
[02:33:36] want to watch the [ __ ] twitch ads in
[02:33:37] the VOD cuz that's annoying I don't know
[02:33:39] why the VOD would have ads so that would
[02:33:42] probably be like
[02:33:45] normal Devils I imagine that before you
[02:33:48] start streaming you ballet dance to your
[02:33:50] desk what does that even mean do they
[02:33:53] pay you for what vaud I don't know but
[02:33:56] YouTube views get like YouTube views are
[02:33:58] monetized I don't know if twitch VA is I
[02:34:00] have no
[02:34:06] clue stop typing
[02:34:08] true I don't ballet
[02:34:15] dance
[02:34:17] I will protect all
[02:34:19] Beauty ooh to
[02:34:24] 90k
[02:34:31] nice we saw the video buddy that was not
[02:34:34] me I know what video you're talking
[02:34:36] about that was not
[02:34:40] me nice what the wait what just happened
[02:34:42] I didn't see
[02:34:45] it
[02:34:48] dude if it was me I would be honest and
[02:34:50] I would own it but it's not
[02:34:59] me I don't want to talk to you guys
[02:35:13] anymore also there's a risk okay I mean
[02:35:16] if we're going to talk about it we can
[02:35:17] talk about it there's a risk of
[02:35:18] officialize channel of being too
[02:35:20] parasocial like I don't know like I
[02:35:23] don't want the person that does it to
[02:35:25] make it feel like it's a job for them if
[02:35:27] the like I cuz I'm not going to like
[02:35:30] employ them to upload it but it's like
[02:35:32] if I do a a channel myself I would just
[02:35:35] automatically upload it each time and it
[02:35:38] would be like no effort for me but then
[02:35:40] it's like I don't want to make one and
[02:35:43] then like make them delete theirs but I
[02:35:45] also don't want them to feel like they
[02:35:46] have to [ __ ] work and it's like I
[02:35:49] don't know I mean like they' keep the
[02:35:50] like you know they get like revenue from
[02:35:52] it but it's like I don't want them to
[02:35:54] feel like it's a job so I don't
[02:35:58] know
[02:36:00] Devils crush them all the I mean
[02:36:06] realistically he would like
[02:36:09] realistically what are you talking about
[02:36:10] a VA Channel realistically it would get
[02:36:12] like okay let's say a VA gets
[02:36:14] like I don't know how many views audio
[02:36:16] get like let's say it's like 5K 10K
[02:36:18] views I don't know let's say it gets 10K
[02:36:20] views 10K views is probably
[02:36:23] like how much money do views give
[02:36:26] you like I mean long videos give more
[02:36:29] probably so it's probably more than I
[02:36:31] know the Lord decree none no it's
[02:36:35] definitely
[02:36:36] some can
[02:36:39] we you know more than us I I mean I know
[02:36:42] for like 20 minute videos not for like a
[02:36:45] 4 Hour VOD is etal but like they would
[02:36:49] keep like realistically cuz if I do it
[02:36:51] myself it would just be myself so like
[02:36:52] if it's someone else doing it they'd
[02:36:54] probably keep like unless I'm paying
[02:36:55] someone to like religiously do it as a
[02:36:57] job if it's just like someone doing it
[02:37:01] automatically almost then I would
[02:37:03] probably split it like 7030
[02:37:05] realistically so then it would be like
[02:37:07] let's say they make I don't know let's
[02:37:08] say the video makes like a 100 it
[02:37:10] probably won't make a 100 how much would
[02:37:11] that video make let's say it makes like
[02:37:14] 50 then it would be like
[02:37:16] let's say they keep 40 is that worth the
[02:37:18] time of reuploading a VOD realistically
[02:37:20] it shouldn't take any time but what if
[02:37:21] the person puts a lot of effort into
[02:37:22] make it nice and time stamping it and
[02:37:24] this and that and this and that it's
[02:37:25] like okay that's cool but it's also not
[02:37:27] something that I would like ask for so
[02:37:29] then is it like part of the job or is it
[02:37:31] like bonus but then if it's bonus they
[02:37:33] should be paid for it but if it's
[02:37:34] something that like I would rather just
[02:37:36] automatically do on my own instead of
[02:37:38] paying for it it's like I don't know
[02:37:39] it's like weird and like I kind of don't
[02:37:40] want to get into it so like I don't
[02:37:44] know
[02:37:46] cuz like if it is time stamp then that
[02:37:48] takes you know how much effort that
[02:37:49] takes like I wouldn't want to force
[02:37:51] someone to watch a 5H hour VOD like the
[02:37:53] guy wouldn't work more than twice a week
[02:37:56] you stream as often as a genin player
[02:38:00] showers like I wouldn't want to have to
[02:38:02] like I wouldn't want to have to make
[02:38:04] someone watch five hours of me like
[02:38:07] that's not worth it for me like I don't
[02:38:09] want or them like I don't want someone
[02:38:10] to watch 5 hours of me just to add time
[02:38:14] stamps I would do that I wouldn't watch
[02:38:17] I would go insane if I watched myself
[02:38:19] for 5
[02:38:24] hours I think people do it naturally yes
[02:38:26] and I appreciate that and I'm grateful
[02:38:28] for that but I feel like if I make it a
[02:38:30] th like if I employ someone to do that I
[02:38:32] would compensate them for it but if it's
[02:38:34] someone doing it for fun that's
[02:38:35] different so it's like I don't want to
[02:38:37] make it like a a transaction cuz then I
[02:38:39] would feel bad not giving them more
[02:38:40] whereas I could do it by myself and just
[02:38:43] like upload it so it's like weird it's
[02:38:45] like a a weird like slope where it's
[02:38:47] like I don't want to make someone like
[02:38:53] work anyways I don't know I don't really
[02:38:56] care like as long as they're happy I'm
[02:38:58] happy I don't really like I'm
[02:38:59] chilling weren't you live 5 hours ago
[02:39:01] yeah we played gin now playing Star H

[02:41:15] reason uh I don't know if I want to talk
[02:41:17] about this now but [ __ ] it the only
[02:41:19] reason I would want to own a VA Channel
[02:41:21] like me not like a fan account is so
[02:41:23] that if sponsors ask for a video I don't
[02:41:26] have to upload it to my main Channel I
[02:41:27] could just like Chuck it there I guess I
[02:41:28] technically have my second Channel but
[02:41:30] my second Channel I actually really
[02:41:31] value cuz I love two iio I think it's a
[02:41:33] banger Channel and mari's editing is
[02:41:36] cracked um so I don't know that's like
[02:41:39] the the main benefit is like if I ever

[03:09:18] character but then it misses and goes
[03:09:20] all into speed or attack and then you

[03:13:31] like a podcaster what do you want from
[03:13:34] me hey guys
[03:13:41] hey
[03:13:44] Argent is really good though I actually
[03:13:45] like him a lot I think he's he seems
[03:13:48] strong but mostly for AOE content a lot
[03:13:50] of the memory of chaos sometimes just
[03:13:52] one big enemy this time this rotation it
[03:13:53] felt like it was pretty AOE though but I
[03:13:55] guess it's like variable but against
[03:13:57] multiple enemies you feels pretty strong
[03:13:59] so I like him Han is cool too especially
[03:14:01] as a like replacement for like bronia or
[03:14:03] whatever very nice for a fourstar I like
