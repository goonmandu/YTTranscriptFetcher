[00:16:51] edge my pillow is like pillow and I'm
[00:16:53] usually like mid pillow right so like I
[00:16:55] literally am taller than the bed but one
[00:16:57] day I was like kind I I don't know what

[00:26:19] man
[00:26:23] man
[00:26:26] man wait so what's happening what happen
[00:26:29] with prime bro dude twitch is so good at
[00:26:31] yapping ton City okay Prime
[00:26:36] cool fixed rates okay so there's still
[00:26:39] Prime
[00:26:40] Subs live laugh Mr
[00:26:44] socks okay there's still Prime Subs
[00:26:50] right you have a beta guide yes a brand
[00:26:53] new one well four months old five months
[00:26:55] I'm sure if you search okay this isn't
[00:26:57] ego by the way but if you literally
[00:26:58] search bet guide it's probably one of
[00:27:00] the first like three
[00:27:02] results yeah boom BET's damage well the
[00:27:07] exact amount of energy recharge you
[00:27:12] need is it early enough can I talk about
[00:27:15] the lore okay I normally there's nothing
[00:27:17] wrong with putting ads in videos ever I
[00:27:19] really don't think it's a bad thing
[00:27:20] unless you're like chilling like yeah go
[00:27:22] gamble all your money like I usually I
[00:27:24] respect the grind but I try for ads to
[00:27:27] put them in like
[00:27:29] more General videos than like character
[00:27:30] guid I usually don't put ads in any
[00:27:32] character guide I never have except one
[00:27:34] time and I don't think it's a bad thing
[00:27:36] I might do in the future like I don't
[00:27:36] think it's a bad thing but I I usually
[00:27:38] try not to I'm just like okay I'll put
[00:27:39] it in another video and honestly as like
[00:27:43] a a corpa business Ms and slices in chat
[00:27:45] we can be corpa I think I should put
[00:27:46] them in guys because they get more views
[00:27:47] and people can just skip through them so
[00:27:49] it's not like a bad thing however I
[00:27:51] still usually when I accept the deal I
[00:27:53] don't put them there but this this video
[00:27:57] I I put it in in the intro and you know
[00:27:58] there's a time if you want to skip it
[00:27:59] it's no big deal
[00:28:00] right and the reason I did was because I
[00:28:03] had pre-recorded let's go back to five
[00:28:05] mon this is five months ago let's scroll
[00:28:07] down so this was here CFA save your

[00:28:18] Friday August 2023
[00:28:25] calendar August 4th was a Friday okay
[00:28:28] how do you know that because on Friday

[00:46:54] either the name ZX or something similar
[00:46:55] and and people think it's me and it's
[00:46:57] not but he confessed to me he said
[00:47:03] sometimes when I play against someone
[00:47:05] like toxic or whatever and I Stomp Them
[00:47:08] really hard I'll report them after so
[00:47:10] they get banned for feeding and then and

[00:47:39] Legends I did I
[00:47:45] dude he literally he literally try he
[00:47:47] literally the one thing he tries to
[00:47:49] convince me is to take a mobile Legends
[00:47:50] sponsor so he gets
[00:47:52] skins got
[00:47:54] him

[00:48:08] is Adventure
[00:48:24] Time imagine Battle Royale and genin map
[00:48:27] I don't want to imagine that we already
[00:48:29] have Battle Royale is just amongst
[00:48:30] content
[00:48:31] creators if the game has no content you
[00:48:34] got to make your own I respect the
[00:48:39] grind some people we you know some
[00:48:41] people do Abyss randomizers other
[00:48:44] [ __ ] Battle Royale
[00:48:47] it I like I I I like PVP should get PVP
[00:48:51] we need to equalize PVP it wouldn't
[00:48:53] happen it would never happen cuz it
[00:48:54] would desent wailing which is not what
[00:48:56] they would want to do but imagine you
[00:48:58] there's a ring in your teapot you get
[00:49:00] one V one people and your constellations
[00:49:01] are all set to either zero or six you
[00:49:03] can choose boom I just solved PVP but it
[00:49:07] would never
[00:49:24] happen
[00:49:27] I met someone with your name in Mobile
[00:49:29] Legends I think it might be your brother
[00:49:31] he's Tom Canada with benetta who the
[00:49:34] [ __ ] is benedetta
[00:49:37] benedetta mobile
[00:49:42] Legends oh yeah he plays this [ __ ] I
[00:49:46] think Chase burst ass yeah yeah it's
[00:49:49] definitely an
[00:49:51] assassin why am I on the wiki bro let me
[00:49:54] go images
[00:49:56] wait I probably shouldn't do this on
[00:49:57] wait wait wait is it is safe search
[00:50:00] on okay there's nothing
[00:50:05] bad maybe I don't know oh yeah yeah yeah
[00:50:08] yeah he actually
[00:50:09] does I think so I've seen that
[00:50:13] skin this is like minus 1K by the
[00:50:19] way minus
[00:50:22] 1K
[00:50:23] scatter the [ __ ] is this
[00:50:34] Al's ripped you know that's the only
[00:50:35] tweet of mine I've muted in my life I
[00:50:37] don't usually mute my own [ __ ] CU I
[00:50:39] don't care that's the only one I muted
[00:50:41] dude I'm sorry man I'm sorry I was more
[00:50:44] than what we had I'm
[00:50:47] sorry I'm
[00:50:51] sorry we
[00:50:54] go th sorry okay I wish we were we got
[00:51:00] more Adventure
[00:51:02] Time got him I make mistakes
[00:51:05] sometimes about once a year I make a
[00:51:08] tweet that I regret that was the one for
[00:51:10] two years ago the one for this year I
[00:51:12] mean you know which one it
[00:51:17] is it happens once a year I make a
[00:51:20] mistake and then I learned from
[00:51:24] it
[00:51:30] [Laughter]
[00:51:32] let just associate the Pea emote with
[00:51:43] it quiet you do be tweeting I mean I
[00:51:47] think I'm
[00:51:48] funny but I think M said it well where
[00:51:51] it was
[00:51:52] like the PE like it's not bad to like
[00:51:56] express your opinion or whatever but
[00:51:57] like some people make content out of it
[00:51:59] and monetize it and then the others that
[00:52:00] don't well then now it's like if they
[00:52:02] say something it'll get monetized by
[00:52:03] person who mon I mean I don't have to be
[00:52:05] like I'm not trying to hide it like if
[00:52:06] you make Drama videos and that's what
[00:52:08] you do like that's what you do but you
[00:52:09] monetize it so it's like you're
[00:52:11] incentivized to like okay I'm going to
[00:52:12] talk about it but then it's like if I
[00:52:14] talk about it it's like what I'm not
[00:52:15] making money from it it doesn't like you
[00:52:16] know so it's like starting a discourse
[00:52:20] like that is just
[00:52:21] like I mean it could be valuable if you
[00:52:24] your inside's valuable but it's
[00:52:26] like you're not
[00:52:41] winning imagine varka came back with you
[00:52:44] ped me five times to say imagine varka
[00:52:47] came back with
[00:52:50] horses yeah I imagine

[00:55:47] I said anemo heal I didn't me to say
[00:55:49] that okay so kaching FAL then dendro an
[00:55:52] emo one of the two Is A Healer the other
[00:55:54] two is aggro so you're either doing Nita
[00:55:56] Jean or like you could do jangi as well
[00:55:59] in he counts as an Nemo and then you
[00:56:00] could also do I like ya yo or BYU with a
[00:56:03] uh Kaza you could also uh uhhh uh uh
[00:56:07] play um um
[00:56:10] um Kirara works as like the Healer uh
[00:56:14] you could also do no healer but if you

[01:10:32] lament tell us do I look like the
[01:10:35] [ __ ] genin
[01:10:36] historian I'm not telling
[01:10:39] you [ __ ] you
[01:10:43] sorry
[01:10:45] yes gotta here comes the
[01:10:49] C de with
[01:10:52] me
[01:11:04] yeah should I pull for Nita or wait for
[01:11:06] the next banner and be Nita list for
[01:11:10] like a year is that who you want to be
[01:11:12] you want to you want to be that one guy
[01:11:14] who's regretting not getting Nita every
[01:11:16] time you see don't feel this game is
[01:11:17] easy don't feel forced to get anyone but
[01:11:19] if you want the and you have Primo
[01:11:22] drums
[01:11:35] the game's not easy resin and grinding
[01:11:37] sucks yeah I mean there's Nuance to it
[01:11:38] but I summarize it in one sentence so
[01:11:40] that people that you know you know what
[01:11:43] I mean the game is it's not like easy
[01:11:45] but it's easy in the sense that you
[01:11:46] could play who you want because like FL
[01:11:49] 12 isn't that like if you know what
[01:11:50] you're doing it's not that hard you just
[01:11:51] need good builds and teams but like you
[01:11:54] can clear with literally any character
[01:11:55] in the game and in fact the character
[01:11:57] that helps that statement be true the
[01:11:59] most is shenyun with
[01:12:02] finina and benett benett it's always
[01:12:07] Bennett
[01:12:09] this the world Y is better than a he no
[01:12:12] that's
[01:12:22] bait
[01:12:26] worthless hello can I pun
[01:12:32] something get out of my
[01:12:36] way I'm King the song it's almost done
[01:12:40] but I don't like the
[01:12:44] end what should I change Trina to in
[01:12:46] this team if I don't have her
[01:12:48] Bennett Bennett still cracked in sh
[01:12:50] teams but like yeah about to get you
[01:12:54] just don't have to use him with SH
[01:12:55] anymore and uh you cannot you don't have
[01:12:57] to play circle
[01:13:01] impact commit it to
[01:13:13] memory is Shia still Shia just got
[01:13:16] better sh's great but sometimes your
[01:13:19] journey ends here but sometimes the um
[01:13:23] the this is not great for him like let's
[01:13:25] say we get the we not and the ruin
[01:13:26] serpent on the same side well that
[01:13:28] wouldn't be a great side for an AOE
[01:13:30] character like
[01:13:38] Shia what's tr's best team the probably
[01:13:40] the one you're seeing but Bennett and
[01:13:43] I'm pretty sure Bennett and Shan Yun are
[01:13:45] pretty similar like Bennett's similar to
[01:13:48] a lot of the characters in that team
[01:13:49] sometimes better but it's also like
[01:13:51] Circle impact and shenu also get gets
[01:13:53] better against one enemy and also helps
[01:13:55] you stack finina more realistically and
[01:13:57] also you could go song if you care about
[01:13:59] just your personal damage and also you
[01:14:00] could go um if you have a catalyst or C2
[01:14:03] it's a big vertical
[01:14:05] investment
[01:14:07] but wait wait for my sh guide for a bit
[01:14:10] more because I need to look into
[01:14:12] it fact on farz on
[01:14:22] MTH
[01:14:26] like sh's teams are these characters
[01:14:28] like for the like Optimal level it's
[01:14:31] these
[01:14:32] characters uh where's
[01:14:41] genuine what the [ __ ] sorry like take as
[01:14:44] many of these as you have and then the
[01:14:46] last thought if you don't only have like
[01:14:47] two or three then the last one you can
[01:14:49] you can do a few things you could do
[01:14:50] like a another anemo you might need one
[01:14:52] like you might need to run like [ __ ]
[01:14:53] thrilling tail sucrose or like Jean or
[01:14:56] like if you need a second pyro with
[01:14:58] benett you can go C6 Tomo you can go
[01:15:00] Jong Lee
[01:15:02] basically those are like the sh
[01:15:07] teams all right 4 11
[01:15:21] 42 does Shen jump buff override de's
[01:15:25] jump you know what we should check that
[01:15:27] no we should check that that's a good
[01:15:29] idea no no no no no no no we should
[01:15:31] check that no we should check that no no
[01:15:34] we should check that we should check
[01:15:36] that because surely de's released a
[01:15:39] completely functionally no no no we
[01:15:40] should check that we should check that
[01:15:43] that's a good question we should check
[01:15:44] that we should check that we should
[01:15:46] check
[01:15:51] that dead meat
[01:16:11] why why do you not
[01:16:18] work I [ __ ] pressed
[01:16:22] retry
[01:16:27] it's
[01:16:28] okay surely next

[01:16:40] bad look at her okay bad as in well I
[01:16:43] guess both senses but you know what I
[01:16:44] mean but respectfully like yeah she look
[01:16:48] look she's good with nevette kind of
[01:16:50] same with
[01:16:52] Lenny but
[01:16:54] like
[01:17:00] yeah okay let's do floor 11 oh my God

[01:17:18] trun oh the Stardust Dr
[01:17:22] reset
[01:17:27] I can't find characters we need team
[01:17:29] presets nope never going to happen all
[01:17:40] good where's
[01:17:46] venty Zio two years ago in 2.7 you told
[01:17:49] me to pick Shia over yolan and I've been
[01:17:51] yolan lless since first of all your
[01:17:54] fault for trusting me second of all your
[01:17:55] fault for not getting Yan on a rerun
[01:17:58] third of all this is your first message
[01:18:00] that literally can't be true and fourth
[01:18:03] of all look may maybe the takea I always
[01:18:07] said Yan was good though but literally
[01:18:09] you could just play SRO and like
[01:18:10] whatever other Hydra you want and if you
[01:18:11] need a main DPS and you want one then
[01:18:13] you know you can get a character
[01:18:19] sorry 2.7 isn't a patch
[01:18:23] [Music]
[01:18:34] what wait a second we're in
[01:18:37] 4.4 that means that lowkey new region
[01:18:40] has to be kind of close dude think I
[01:18:42] didn't even think about the next one
[01:18:44] wait a second font feels new to me bro
[01:18:46] wait a second 4.4 that means like 4.
[01:18:49] like seven

[01:18:59] natland dragon the Pyro

[01:19:27] cosmetics and floor 15 Abyss
[01:19:29] awesome
[01:19:36] aware
[01:19:48] aware time to show make new ones for not
[01:19:51] land
[01:19:53] St Cloud
[01:19:55] confir L man I said this for every
[01:20:13] patch don't worry in the nation of war
[01:20:16] and dragons are to play Candy Crush and
[01:20:20] Neo wait V's broken here hell y also I
[01:20:24] don't I don't have I don't think I have
[01:20:25] artifacts on him though
[01:20:28] so I mean maybe I do
[01:20:32] yourselfs time for take off I said I
[01:20:36] might take that more Abyss for is a
[01:20:37] terrible idea okay [ __ ] Okay
[01:20:40] well you want to [ __ ] play Let's Play
[01:20:42] let's talk LOL XD I see you [ __ ] live
[01:20:45] streaming Zio play Elden ring look look
[01:20:48] you think I'm [ __ ] getting one guy
[01:20:49] look Zio stream Elden
[01:20:51] ring listen I I [ __ ] follow you
[01:20:54] [ __ ] listen okay yes yes the
[01:20:57] abyss is [ __ ] stupid as [ __ ] compared
[01:20:59] to a lot of other like of what genin
[01:21:02] could have for Content okay I've said
[01:21:04] this before I'll say it again genin's
[01:21:05] combat system is too good for the game
[01:21:07] there should be a ways to express it
[01:21:08] other than just the abyss okay I want to
[01:21:10] reemphasize that however yeah more Abyss
[01:21:12] Wars something more than 12 would still
[01:21:14] be nice yes I think we should get other
[01:21:16] forms of combat Co like [ __ ]
[01:21:18] genuinely raids or like Dungeons or
[01:21:19] scalable some of the event modes are so
[01:21:21] sick make them permanent there's
[01:21:22] literally a video that's like 2 years
[01:21:23] old about this by the way mtashed Zio
[01:21:27] endgame oh [ __ ] wait I thought this guy
[01:21:29] doesn't complain ever oh what this video
[01:21:31] is like 2 years old shut up [ __ ] you
[01:21:33] listen look no look look I literally
[01:21:35] have like a notepad look
[01:21:39] maybe while a similar expansion of the
[01:21:41] spal Abyss could constitute an expansion
[01:21:42] of end game content that would simply be
[01:21:44] redundant and efficient therefore I
[01:21:45] propose the following reuse one time
[01:21:47] limited content like story domains
[01:21:48] adding difficulty rewards and
[01:21:49] potentially Co-op certained permanent
[01:21:50] events with scalable difficulty and
[01:21:51] actual rewards Labyrinth events raay
[01:21:53] dungeons can be 4 to eight players Co-op
[01:21:54] doesn't have to be incredibly difficult
[01:21:56] but still challenging can have puzzles
[01:21:57] interactive content not just artifact
[01:21:58] check mechanics fully optimal uh uh
[01:22:01] optional plus rewards a Rog likee type
[01:22:03] permanent game mode I literally call
[01:22:05] simulated universe is this not a Rog
[01:22:07] like type permanent game mode is that
[01:22:09] not [ __ ] simulated Universe this was
[01:22:12] released October
[01:22:15] 2022 I should be a Dev I should be a Dev
[01:22:18] anyways let me keep going let me keep
[01:22:19] going rewards can be untradeable there
[01:22:21] are cool Cosmetics like pets Wings
[01:22:23] animated name cards skins dude they
[01:22:25] literally I swear to God chat someone
[01:22:28] watched this someone watched this and

[01:38:17] my chat was like why don't you read my
[01:38:18] messages and I read their messages and I
[01:38:19] saw that there was a ruined serpent but
[01:38:21] here's what we have to deal with for
[01:38:22] this Abyss apparently it's annoying as
[01:38:24] [ __ ] I don't know if it's hard or not
[01:38:25] though okay this looks fine ruin serpent
[01:38:28] I hate you we not I hate you at least he
[01:38:31] not level 100 uh these look fine this
[01:38:33] looks good for Shia first half looks
[01:38:34] good for Shia second half is just
[01:38:35] [ __ ] single Target Galore yeah
[01:38:38] okay this will be fine annoying enemies
[01:38:42] but it'll be fine I they always do this
[01:38:43] thing now where one half is like super
[01:38:45] single Target bosses uh because there is
[01:38:47] a yoia and Hut man working for them
[01:38:51] um hyper Bloom salesman but it should be
[01:38:53] fine we'll do a fourar clear as
[01:38:56] well I don't know if it's good for
[01:38:58] guming though but whatever we'll do five
[01:39:01] star and four star clear I think but
[01:39:02] we'll start with just the normal stuff
[01:39:04] uh Last Christmas I gave you my
[01:39:09] heart last Abyss we should have won
[01:39:12] first try but I threw and I [ __ ]
[01:39:14] scammed Believers and I'm sorry and
[01:39:15] doubters won this time I promise
[01:39:19] Believers I won't let you down I mean it
[01:39:21] I actually mean it I won't we're not
[01:39:23] going to run Shield characters we're
[01:39:24] going to play Shia I'll height them I
[01:39:30] think last Christmas gave you my
[01:39:34] [Music]

[01:39:43] not have D res I know he has Animo res I
[01:39:44] don't know about dendro but oh no I
[01:39:46] think it's just a Nemo it doesn't matter
[01:39:47] though like it'll be easy I know never
[01:39:50] probably crack but I don't want to
[01:39:53] no isn't it like 70 30 30 30 30 30 or is
[01:39:57] it also dendro might be 7070 or like
[01:40:00] 7060 I don't remember I could probably
[01:40:02] look it
[01:40:06] up only an
[01:40:08] emo play Ula for my
[01:40:11] birthday no but maybe later uh so our
[01:40:15] teams are going to be Shia with the new
[01:40:17] five star shenu who I don't even have

[01:41:39] like the peanut butter the Creator said
[01:41:41] so that's dumb it's Graphics interchange
[01:41:45] format the p& J Peg stands for
[01:41:47] photographic but I bet you don't say J
[01:41:50] Fang
[01:41:51] p on its own isn't pronounced like f
[01:41:53] that's totally different it's exactly
[01:41:55] the same name one word that starts with
[01:41:58] G pronounced like J
[01:42:00] gentrification shoot should have thought
[01:42:02] of that I was just in San Francisco for

[01:48:47] me all right 123 so far so good
[01:48:51] honestly maybe we actually play our free
[01:48:52] to play count this patch this looks like
[01:48:54] a good Abyss for
[01:48:55] us what's Shu best set for sha if I
[01:48:58] don't song of past okay Verdes and vener
[01:49:00] is still the best for buffing your team
[01:49:01] like with finina but if you mean Shia um
[01:49:04] okay ocean H clam can be comparable to S
[01:49:06] do fast team damage wise sometimes a bit
[01:49:08] better I think a bit better on average
[01:49:10] but for Shia himself it's either song or
[01:49:12] no
[01:49:14] bless or I guess 2 be twoce attack but
[01:49:17] that's kind of cope okay let's go frea
[01:49:21] your journey ends here wrong enemies I
[01:49:23] have like no
[01:49:28] energy didn't stop
[01:49:32] me okay but like I still clear first try
[01:49:34] if I don't reset it doesn't matter it's
[01:49:36] still a win if I still clear for try I'm

[01:49:39] need far on I don't need far
[01:49:41] on okay but I had no energy so I
[01:49:44] couldn't if frame that's not my fault
[01:49:45] dude it actually wasn't my fault I just
[01:49:47] pressed e slow motion what happened that
[01:49:49] wasn't I don't have a
[01:49:52] energy disappear how was that my fault
[01:49:56] watch I'm not going to reset I'm not
[01:49:57] going to reset I'm not going to reset

[01:50:02] trial I'm
[01:50:05] sorry first try first try first try no
[01:50:07] reset no reset no reset I'm going to
[01:50:09] have to read what I wrote in the Gamba
[01:50:10] if I wrote no reset then we win if I
[01:50:12] wrote no deaths then
[01:50:14] I Make Way
[01:50:16] for maybe I'm scamming I'm actually
[01:50:19] scamming
[01:50:21] see I don't need far on see I don't need
[01:50:23] far
[01:50:29] on okay what did I say in the Gamba what
[01:50:32] did I say what did I
[01:50:37] say I said no reset now typically
[01:50:41] there's a legal precedent something you
[01:50:42] learn in common law is a legal precedent
[01:50:45] where if you always say no deaths no
[01:50:48] deaths there's a precedent that okay no
[01:50:49] deaths is expected and typically I do no
[01:50:51] deaths but in this agreement I only
[01:50:54] wrote no reset and I did not mention
[01:50:57] deaths and so because of
[01:51:05] this okay here's what I'm going to do
[01:51:08] I'm going to start this I'm going to
[01:51:09] make it fair for doubters I'm going to
[01:51:11] start not move do 10 jumping jacks then
[01:51:14] come back and play and if I'm not dead

[01:52:51] so you might struggle with this Abyss
[01:52:53] because they're annoying I'm going to
[01:52:55] play fourstar characters next but as far
[01:52:57] as like difficulty goes for me that was
[01:52:59] a lot easier than average many poorly
[01:53:01] written applications lately I guess I'll
[01:53:04] just [ __ ] [ __ ] people

[01:53:51] [Music]
[01:53:53] okay okay these are teams are running
[01:53:55] floor 12 let's get it first try no
[01:53:58] resets no misses no deaths no okay but
[01:54:02] that was after the Gamba started what
[01:54:03] about when I started the Gamba that was
[01:54:04] after that's too late you can't go back
[01:54:05] on the contract okay I haven't I've
[01:54:08] tried not to look at 4 12 I kind of got
[01:54:10] spoiled I know there's a we not and then
[01:54:11] someone in my chat was like why don't
[01:54:12] you read my message and I read their
[01:54:13] messages and I saw that there was a
[01:54:14] ruined serpent but here's what we have
[01:54:16] to deal with for this Abyss apparently
[01:54:17] it's annoying as [ __ ] I don't know if
[01:54:19] it's hard or not though okay yeah okay
[01:54:22] is a I don't know you
[01:54:29] my net would be
[01:54:35] better with the new dude how do I lose
[01:54:38] every time Yan Ki we'll do a fourar
[01:54:41] clear after we don't need to gear
[01:54:43] everyone's already geared we're going to
[01:54:44] start it's not rning doesn't count it's
[01:54:46] non-legal binding that's not true so uh
[01:54:49] I know in Ada law but I'm pretty sure
[01:54:50] it's the same in America cuz it's common
[01:54:51] law uh it's not the the legal system
[01:54:54] isn't based on formality so if you talk
[01:54:56] you can have verbal agreements and if
[01:54:57] like when you're signing a contract both
[01:54:59] parties understand something then that
[01:55:01] discussion they had is relevant even if
[01:55:03] it's just like like verbal like talking
[01:55:06] if you all two minutes to
[01:55:09] vote like let's say in a contract it
[01:55:11] says like okay if you sign this like
[01:55:14] like I don't know we'll
[01:55:17] [ __ ] if we
[01:55:23] will he ninar first try no
[01:55:26] reset yes he's so talented no skill

[01:55:35] lose
[01:55:37] nah nah I'd
[01:55:41] win
[01:55:44] wait no I did say no deaths though
[01:55:49] whatever
[01:55:52] okay
[01:55:53] fine I'm sorry
[01:55:59] Believers but see now there's people
[01:56:01] that are saying just give back the
[01:56:03] points so I successfully did the cycle
[01:56:06] of muddying the waters where doubters
[01:56:08] were like okay we win and then I muddied

[02:06:44] or a good weapon or fora like Bennett
[02:06:47] like I mean I can but it's going to be
[02:06:48] very mid
[02:06:49] I don't mind it's going to be very mid
[02:06:51] what's the point of it I mean what's the
[02:06:52] point of okay respectfully play who you
[02:06:58] like I mean it's fine it's a fourar DPS
[02:07:02] it's
[02:07:03] fine it's
[02:07:07] fine honestly m is not bad it's actually
[02:07:10] not
[02:07:13] bad
[02:07:17] but
[02:07:20] mil has actually a lot of stats to be
[02:07:44] fair I'm going to go for a CR
[02:07:47] cirit
[02:07:55] wait this is so much em dude it's not a
[02:07:57] bad thing but like holy
[02:08:00] [ __ ] even trial has
[02:08:03] serpent
[02:08:06] oh th on C6 Bennett I'm new to the game
[02:08:08] is it worth uh for the most part it's
[02:08:10] not it's pretty good like it's it's
[02:08:13] usually beneficial there's it only ruins
[02:08:15] like a few very Niche stuff but for the
[02:08:18] most like you're not playing like YULA
[02:08:19] or aako with Bennett usually like if you
[02:08:21] do it with YULA it's like for a funny
[02:08:23] number and even if you're going for that
[02:08:24] if for normal tax or pyro doesn't matter
[02:08:26] like usually it's whatever I haven't
[02:08:28] made a video on it yet but did I say
[02:08:30] fishal I meant to say kaching who do I
[02:08:32] mean to say AA I don't know Ula those
[02:08:34] are the
[02:08:41] three I guess the only thing is like
[02:08:43] aaka
[02:08:47] melt the most the main reason why I like
[02:08:49] C6 benett now is because of Shen Yun for
[02:08:52] the most part and
[02:08:54] ging dude Shen has
[02:08:56] skin I want to player okay we're going
[02:08:59] to do a force clear uh we're going to
[02:09:01] play so normally for a force clear I
[02:09:03] like to do a team known as
[02:09:06] 1618 because it was accidentally
[02:09:07] included at the 1618 time stamp of my
[02:09:10] Bennett video where I do Rosaria
[02:09:12] Kaaya Shang
[02:09:17] Ling and Bennett but unfor but right now
[02:09:20] what I want to do is see if gaming can
[02:09:22] work in this team because why not see if
[02:09:25] we can melt enough I don't know if we
[02:09:27] can but I think it'd be cool to
[02:09:31] try I just realized my K's on iron sting
[02:09:34] and if we're melting on gumming we are
[02:09:36] not melting on
[02:09:38] Kaa so let me take off the iron
[02:09:45] stink where's
[02:09:47] Kyo help me Mr spog wait he's level 90
[02:09:50] what the
[02:09:58] hell
[02:10:07] black all right 1618 again but with
[02:10:10] guming in the first slot we're going to
[02:10:11] do
[02:10:11] gumming actually no [ __ ] that Rosario is
[02:10:14] still number one Rosario
[02:10:16] K gaming
[02:10:18] and Bennett in the second half we're
[02:10:20] going to do uh hyper Loom I think we're
[02:10:22] just hyper so official sorry that's not
[02:10:24] official
[02:10:25] sross FAL
[02:10:39] srol I want to use DMC
[02:10:42] here but I feel like I need a Healer or
[02:10:45] I will
[02:10:47] die
[02:10:52] I could use yao yao but I don't know if
[02:10:55] it's enough dendro for this
[02:10:57] team but I think this is what's gonna my
[02:10:59] free to playay accounts team is this so
[02:11:00] I kind of want to test if it works I

[02:13:25] disrespect no disrespect no disrespect I
[02:13:27] actually kind of like the mean
[02:13:30] but who is playing gen an impact and
[02:13:33] every day you're like man I can't wait
[02:13:36] to to be reunited At
[02:13:38] Last I can't wait to meet the D Leaf
[02:13:42] [ __ ] skirk again I can't wait to meet

[02:14:01] Senora like it's cool when he appears in
[02:14:03] the story okay don't get me wrong I
[02:14:05] remember that Quest I think 1.4 when
[02:14:07] there's like the upside down [ __ ]
[02:14:09] statue of the seven and then Aether
[02:14:10] popped up with [ __ ] like okay okay
[02:14:12] that's pretty cool it's cool but I'm not
[02:14:14] playing like yes I can't wait to save my
[02:14:17] brother
[02:14:23] brother I think we die at the end and
[02:14:25] get the other sibling it would be cool
[02:14:27] it might be the other way around but
[02:14:28] there's no way cuz imagine you're like a
[02:14:30] self insert you're like oh my God I'm
[02:14:32] ather and like every girl loves me and
[02:14:34] then you die and you're Luman that would
[02:14:36] be sick actually I wish that upon those
[02:14:38] people but that's not going to happen
[02:14:40] you you can't like that would not happen
[02:14:42] because then they'd be so pissed they'd
[02:14:44] actually be so
[02:14:46] pissed
[02:14:57] I think it would be
[02:15:09] funny every girl and boy asterisk I mean
[02:15:13] I do think they make like 90% of
[02:15:15] characters s for traveler in one way or
[02:15:16] another not 90 but like a pretty high
[02:15:19] percentage but I mean you you know how
[02:15:21] that one Aether M
[02:15:27] was they really hated Shia for some
[02:15:33] reason sorry Aether Ms in chat you guys
[02:15:36] got a bad
[02:15:46] rep
[02:16:09] he hated you calling him gay yeah man
[02:16:11] his masculinity is so fragile that me
[02:16:13] hinting that Shia was flirting with the
[02:16:15] traveler made him want to like jump off
[02:16:17] a in real life I'm sorry please don't do
[02:16:20] that please take care of your mental
[02:16:21] health don't don't do

[02:33:11] quite consistently and then she has high
[02:33:13] em so it's chilling but bro it's F
[02:33:16] impossible when the guy keeps [ __ ]
[02:33:21] running okay yeah sug is actually bad
[02:33:23] here like Su special is pretty bad
[02:33:28] here okay

[02:33:43] YULA Banner
[02:33:45] KW
[02:33:48] no ER well maybe the ER is a thing
[02:34:15] but Shen Nita is the best day one sale
[02:34:18] ever
[02:34:21] damn I mean it's also
[02:34:24] Nita do we know the split between shenon
[02:34:26] and Nita cuz Nita's [ __ ]
[02:34:37] broken I don't know if that's real

[02:35:13] in my opinion if genin is your life and
[02:35:15] this is coming from
[02:35:16] me it's a lot worse as a game than if
[02:35:20] it's like you take breaks you play you
[02:35:21] take breaks you play in my opinion and
[02:35:24] I'm no disrespect genon if you're
[02:35:26] watching genon no disrespect but yeah
[02:35:28] disrespect because we don't have endgame
[02:35:29] we don't have actual content to play
[02:35:30] every day so I think that personally the
[02:35:33] way I like games like
[02:35:36] this personally why is your name hit
[02:35:39] from
[02:35:41] zabak sorry zabac traumatizes me can we
[02:35:44] ban that guy
[02:35:47] com for a long break sucks ass wait
[02:35:49] really why okay so I'm a little bit out
[02:35:54] of
[02:35:56] the I can't have a like I hm how do I
[02:36:00] say
[02:36:03] this I play genin in bursts of like I
[02:36:07] always have to play the game because I
[02:36:09] make videos on it but like when I
[02:36:10] actually enjoy it I feel like it's like
[02:36:12] burst it's like I'll enjoy it for a
[02:36:13] bunch and then I'll like barely play off
[02:36:14] stream and I'll enjoy a bunch and I'll
[02:36:16] barely play off stream like that's why I
[02:36:17] said this a while blah but my inauma
[02:36:19] exploration is garbage cuz I didn't
[02:36:21] really care I'm not like wow I can't
[02:36:22] wait to explore Sarah Island I was just
[02:36:24] bored but like I enjoyed suu a lot it
[02:36:29] wasn't that one region is necessarily
[02:36:30] better than the other although I'm a
[02:36:32] sumaru
[02:36:33] enjoyer um but it's like sometimes I
[02:36:36] just like not motivated to just like
[02:36:38] explore and play the
[02:36:41] game but I guess I don't know enjoy the
[02:36:44] game how you want to enjoy the game I'm
[02:36:46] just someone who often times I'll like
[02:36:48] not play a game for a while and I'll go
[02:36:49] back to the game for a lot of games not
[02:36:51] just
[02:36:55] genin but hey play the game every day
[02:36:57] every week every year every don't play
[02:36:59] the game do what you want to
[02:37:01] do I love font is pretty good Su is
[02:37:05] probably still my favorite but Fontan is
[02:37:09] font is cool they made underwater not
[02:37:11] complete garbage which I didn't think
[02:37:13] was possible so that's cool
[02:37:17] all right you ready review finina is
[02:37:20] coming okay you're a little late on that
[02:37:22] uh I know you said you didn't play for
[02:37:24] like five months you might want to
[02:37:25] update your bio finina came um you
[02:37:27] actually could get her on maybe a rerun
[02:37:29] coming soon hopefully uh usually archons
[02:37:31] get a rerun so anyways um Sino
[02:37:35] Nita Oh I thought this was a team this
[02:37:37] doesn't look like a team okay let's do a
[02:37:39] quick review Soo Scarlet Sands Guild of
[02:37:43] Dreams that's good that is very good
[02:37:47] with Scarlet Sands especially em is
[02:37:49] better I recommended em Sands but these
[02:37:51] Subs are [ __ ] insane so I wouldn't
[02:37:53] recommend benching the sand but you know
[02:37:56] eventually you want an em sand you could
[02:37:57] use this on so many characters I wish I
[02:37:58] had this from my them I'm actually mad
[02:38:00] at you now uh good goblet good feather
[02:38:04] yeah your build's good man it's good you
[02:38:06] have 130 ER I I like
[02:38:09] TF I like 4tf Soo but the build is
[02:38:12] really good so the only like you could
[02:38:13] upgrade to TF but it's not that big of a
[02:38:15] deal Nita
[02:38:17] deepwood
[02:38:19] sack yeah it's good Ryden
[02:38:23] that's
[02:38:28] fine yeah I mean that's fine Bennett's
[02:38:31] good
[02:38:33] officials wait yo swap
[02:38:37] your that's fine okay you only want the
[02:38:40] two be on
[02:38:43] ficial also you don't want an em Goblin
[02:38:45] on ficial
[02:38:50] um okay yeah your FAL definitely needs
[02:38:53] work I would recommend two Beast
[02:38:56] thundering Fury to Beast another set or
[02:38:58] golden tro now just came out well 4.0
[02:39:00] came out really
[02:39:01] good forb is good especially not C6
[02:39:04] don't talk to me golden troop is cracked
[02:39:06] I'm pretty sure golden troop is just
[02:39:07] like way okay I guess compared to 2B
[02:39:10] stopes
[02:39:13] sure but golden
[02:39:18] troop no no it's a it's not an em it's
[02:39:20] em goblet not sand
[02:39:22] chatter goblet attack or Em's fine with
[02:39:25] aggravate uh but goblet shouldn't be em
[02:39:29] should be Electro if you can although
[02:39:30] these sub stats are insane but still
[02:39:33] yeah I would I would highly recommend
[02:39:34] farming golden troop new
[02:39:36] domain I'm going to pretend I didn't see
[02:39:38] that shimwa Yia this is pretty good
[02:39:41] pretty good pretty good uh that's okay
[02:39:43] that's good that's decent okay not bad
[02:39:46] thundering pulse nice good Yia J lead
[02:39:49] 37k HP black Dazzle good I would go fa
[02:39:53] but black Dazzle is good too yeah pretty
[02:39:54] pretty good account only thing I would
[02:39:55] change is fal's build um and well I
[02:39:59] don't want to talk about this but Di all
[02:40:01] also uh Ryden could use how much yard do
[02:40:04] you have this is fine although with
[02:40:07] engulfing I'm pretty sure you want
[02:40:09] attack yeah with the engulfing ER
[02:40:11] Electro is better or ER like er attack's
[02:40:13] still fine but typically
[02:40:16] but it's
[02:40:21] okay fora Shen Yun finina would benett
[02:40:24] be better than farzon
[02:40:26] C3
[02:40:29] I am the out of all the Shia Maines in
[02:40:32] the world I'm the Shain that hates okay
[02:40:36] finina C6 sorry farzon C6 I love you
[02:40:39] you're great you're beautiful you're
[02:40:40] amazing every Faron before C6 is like
[02:40:44] driving a truck without the steering
[02:40:45] steing wheel but you're like using like
[02:40:46] the wires and like your your wheel yo T
[02:40:49] this a rain you're you're using one sec
[02:40:51] I'm in the middle of it you're using
[02:40:52] like the wires so you're riding okay you
[02:40:53] have like think of like a Ford pickup
[02:40:55] truck right except what's wrong with the
[02:40:57] truck is there's like Every Time We
[02:41:00] Touch I get this feeling but also every
[02:41:03] time we kiss I swear I could fly and
[02:41:05] you're driving the car but then it's
[02:41:07] like a bumpy road so it's like okay like
[02:41:09] I can still drive this but it's bumping
[02:41:10] and then you hit a really big bump and
[02:41:12] then what happens the wheel flies off
[02:41:14] but it's okay cuz you still have like
[02:41:16] half the wheel like it broke but you
[02:41:18] could still like you have like the
[02:41:19] [ __ ] like the little thing you can
[02:41:20] like kind of steer it and it's good it's
[02:41:22] better than walking I'd rather drive
[02:41:24] that than [ __ ] be on a horse I'd
[02:41:27] rather drive that than be on a
[02:41:29] bicycle but it's it's it's annoying it's
[02:41:32] like [ __ ] I wish I had er [ __ ] I wish I
[02:41:34] had my my my my Shan Yun had er [ __ ] I
[02:41:36] wish my Shia had
[02:41:38] ER but it works so to answer your
[02:41:42] question chatter I would go Bennett over
[02:41:44] a non C6 on for
[02:41:47] sure uh for a lot of the who is better
[02:41:50] when I'll probably rely on uh uh not R
[02:41:53] but work with Shia Mains shout out to
[02:41:55] them discord.gg sha I think when I make
[02:41:58] my guide but for the most part my tier
[02:42:02] list of characters to play with Shia is
[02:42:05] okay here's the thing thanks again for
[02:42:06] the raid by the way here's the
[02:42:08] thing farzon isn't just like so some
[02:42:11] characters are like okay they're just a
[02:42:12] bit better at C6 like like
[02:42:14] Sara
[02:42:16] like Sara but farzon is a
[02:42:19] listen where's farzon where's farzon
[02:42:21] where's farzon when I [ __ ] find you
[02:42:24] sorry here's what farzon gets at
[02:42:29] C6
[02:42:31] R too much appreciate it listen here's
[02:42:35] what Shain here's what you sorry here's
[02:42:37] what you unlock with C6 fars on first 40
[02:42:40] crit damage okay that's pretty good
[02:42:43] that's almost a circlet okay
[02:42:46] second your skill hits things every
[02:42:48] every every three seconds okay that
[02:42:51] doesn't sound that
[02:42:52] impressive Until you realize what does
[02:42:55] that mean well one it generates energy
[02:42:57] okay that's really good that's arguably
[02:42:59] the best [ __ ] part okay
[02:43:03] two it kind of groups enemies that's
[02:43:07] pretty good three you can run MTH
[02:43:09] because it's your skill
[02:43:13] damage sorry
[02:43:16] I I it's just it's just like it's just
[02:43:19] really
[02:43:23] good C4 farzon is C1 shenyun or C1 Nita
[02:43:27] better what for who is C1 Nita better I
[02:43:31] mean yes but not for
[02:43:42] Chia so for see far is Mill best Set uh
[02:43:46] for for shall buffing
[02:43:48] yes ver ver Vermilion sorry vescent
[02:43:53] vener I began my involuntary standard
[02:43:56] best for like swirling [ __ ] when can I
[02:43:59] go home Dr
[02:44:03] Z like if you're playing like Scara
[02:44:05] farzon like Singo you probably want ver
[02:44:07] vener although usually when you play
[02:44:08] farzon with scar you're playing like
[02:44:10] hyperare you go like Bennett Toma or
[02:44:11] Bennett Lea or whatever the [ __ ] but
[02:44:14] finina I guess was 31 for V that's
[02:44:17] replying to
[02:44:28] Something song or viw for shenu with
[02:44:30] ging okay it is not even close you
[02:44:34] either go veres and
[02:44:39] vener sorry I got
[02:44:43] distracted C there a
[02:44:45] yeah yeah get is better okay let me
[02:44:48] actually do a for clear I'm
[02:44:51] stalling fa LG LG F C6 I use fav though
[02:44:57] cuz the for me I think faron's very
[02:44:59] depressing to like press my skill and
[02:45:01] not get energy so five makes me feel
[02:45:02] like I get
[02:45:04] energy I like five on her and L on yolan
[02:45:07] anyways okay I have to clear the force
[02:45:09] St clear who the [ __ ] are we playing
[02:45:12] Ki what if I play cave again
[02:45:20] I mean guming is unironically good but I
[02:45:23] don't know if he's that good this a bit
[02:45:25] I mean I dude these enemies are so
[02:45:28] annoying for him though I feel like
[02:45:30] these enemies are really annoying for
[02:45:36] guming I clear with guming yeah but full
[02:45:38] forar teams I'm saying like gaming like
[02:45:41] is still good but like this this these
[02:45:43] enemies seem annoying for him but but I
[02:45:45] I if anything I'll would do like finina
[02:45:46] Kaza oh sorry Karina
[02:45:53] shenyun yeah I think I'm just going to
[02:45:55] play
[02:45:57] Kookie okay we'll do the same thing but
[02:46:00] with
[02:46:00] Kookie who's my auto attacker
[02:46:07] then Chad who's my auto
[02:46:09] attacker we're playing
[02:46:13] SRO cookie
[02:46:15] I mean I guess you don't need to Auto
[02:46:17] attack on this [ __ ] team like it's
[02:46:18] literally just I mean yeah you do I mean
[02:46:21] I could do
[02:46:22] bet un ironically just whack on
[02:46:25] Betto no no no no wait it's single
[02:46:27] Target I lied I mean I could fishal and
[02:46:29] then just try not to yoink the
[02:46:37] cores ya Yao might be better than we
[02:46:40] think
[02:46:43] because yeah would be better than we
[02:46:45] think because even though her dendro is
[02:46:46] like worse than DMC against the we not I
[02:46:48] can only apply dendro for like 5 Seconds
[02:46:50] anyways so she essentially has 100% off
[02:46:52] time like I could just burst whenever he
[02:46:53] goes
[02:46:54] down also yes I think I could just swap
[02:46:58] my first
[02:46:59] team because the Strang L team is so
[02:47:01] much
[02:47:05] better maybe that's the play and then
[02:47:08] first half I just play like beta or some
[02:47:12] [ __ ] that could be the play actually
[02:47:22] all right chat you ready for the BET
[02:47:24] propaganda cuz I'm about to [ __ ] sell
[02:47:26] you on
[02:47:28] BET okay I actually don't have a weapon
[02:47:31] for her that's not serpent
[02:47:32] though this is literally the only weapon
[02:47:34] I have so uh yeah it is what it
[02:47:43] is but in in compensation for that I
[02:47:46] will take my Rosario off Deathmatch you
[02:47:47] didn't even know she's on Deathmatch so
[02:47:48] you didn't have time to b w me you
[02:47:50] didn't even realize so you can't even
[02:47:51] complain oh wait I can't give that to
[02:47:53] Shang L wait wait what should I run I'll
[02:47:54] go [ __ ] fav [ __ ] it actually you I'll
[02:47:58] go Dragon
[02:48:05] Bane
[02:48:13] opa wait is my bet geared F okay not
[02:48:16] even joking 25 gifted if she's not
[02:48:18] geared okay she's geared she's geared
[02:48:21] she's geared if you ever want to trade
[02:48:23] tactics what's our team going to look
[02:48:24] like
[02:48:26] bet fishal sucros DMC or SRO sross [ __ ]
[02:48:31] DMC maybe
[02:48:35] ER 140 is
[02:48:38] enough 140 is actually fine we hit our
[02:48:41] parries it's fine 140 is fine if you hit
[02:48:43] your paries I can hit my parries it's
[02:48:47] fine I'll literally prove it to you it's
[02:48:50] fine it's
[02:48:56] fine it's fine why you D
[02:49:00] copium on the wrong flower
[02:49:10] though okay
[02:49:13] 150 150
[02:49:16] one of is actually fine
[02:49:23] though all right first half B
[02:49:27] fickle
[02:49:30] xq suck or we could do
[02:49:35] dendro we'll
[02:49:38] see second half we are going to play
[02:49:40] nevet no we're not Shang
[02:49:43] Ling this this team might also be
[02:49:45] annoying cuz we have to follow the the
[02:49:46] [ __ ] we not around and we play circle
[02:49:48] impact so this might also be bad for the
[02:49:51] weot I actually just hate the we
[02:49:57] not do think we're g to get F dude I
[02:50:00] don't want to do this anymore it'll be
[02:50:06] fine where the dude where the [ __ ] is Ka
[02:50:10] here
[02:50:12] vett XL
[02:50:19] C play DMC okay new
[02:50:23] plan we do bet official Quicken
[02:50:27] aggravate oh we don't have a bow
[02:50:29] character [ __ ] okay
[02:50:43] okay I did all of that for nothing I did
[02:50:47] all that planning that gearing for
[02:50:56] nothing 10 gifted if you replace Rosario
[02:50:59] with
[02:51:00] aloy I need more than [ __ ] 10 gifted
[02:51:02] to gear aloy brother I need more than 10
[02:51:05] gifted to [ __ ] gear aloy
[02:51:13] brother
[02:51:23] be done eventually I don't want to lose
[02:51:27] those
[02:51:35] me five class you took growing
[02:51:43] up
[02:51:46] I would run ya ya here but she's on deep
[02:51:48] with not
[02:51:56] instructor what if I just do this we
[02:51:58] don't have an auto attacker though is
[02:51:59] there a fourar dental Catalyst that
[02:52:01] could be on field on maybe Kirara
[02:52:03] favorite class you took growing up I
[02:52:05] don't even
[02:52:07] know I like my teacher of
[02:52:12] uh but um
[02:52:17] kirar is basically a catalyst no she's
[02:52:19] not SRO won't
[02:52:23] work is there anyone I can Auto attack
[02:52:26] on [ __ ] I mean I guess fishal but like
[02:52:33] Jesus
[02:52:35] cave honestly maybe I think cave might
[02:52:38] be better than DMC here DMC
[02:52:43] here
[02:52:51] God damn it we have to [ __ ] gear all
[02:52:54] right get your gearing badges ready chat
[02:52:56] yep you already know gearing BGE but
[02:52:58] let's test artifact presets okay
[02:53:00] everyone this is the definitive artifact
[02:53:03] preset test does it work or does it twer
[02:53:06] let's try fast equip quick configuration
[02:53:10] okay not quick conf why do F why do
[02:53:11] [ __ ] use tenacity fast equip
[02:53:14] custom
[02:53:16] main a no no we just do set type no main
[02:53:18] aics deepwood that's it generate dude
[02:53:21] it's empty [ __ ] you I don't care I don't
[02:53:23] care about her stats I don't
[02:53:27] care I reset
[02:53:30] it fast equip dude who's playing MTH yao
[02:53:34] yao [ __ ] you I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[02:53:36] sorry whoever you are and you ruin my
[02:53:37] fast equip I hate you let's just do
[02:53:40] custom okay custom Let's test if this
[02:53:42] works HP HP I don't care I do do not
[02:53:44] care what she's running defense [ __ ] it
[02:53:46] or healing sure DB okay actually I need
[02:53:51] ER okay this should be
[02:53:58] good this actually works we [ __ ] up our
[02:54:01] be uh beo
[02:54:04] by but it
[02:54:12] works well let me generate a let me
[02:54:14] check Alternatives maybe no but this is
[02:54:17] like the same as if I were going to gear
[02:54:19] manually it's not this is actually not
[02:54:21] faster I mean it it would have been if I
[02:54:23] pressed yes here but I don't really
[02:54:28] like the the thing is the thing is with
[02:54:31] the ya is like you don't care about your
[02:54:32] stats so that's like not worth like so
[02:54:35] for Shen unit's really nice cuz I could
[02:54:36] swap from song fast of veres matter by
[02:54:39] needing the same thing but with ya Yao
[02:54:41] all I need to do is literally set filter
[02:54:43] deepwood and then the main that does not
[02:54:44] matter so I'll do like Hydro I don't
[02:54:46] care cuz you're not dealing damage on
[02:54:47] her you're just like you need ER that's
[02:54:49] it so the ER stands I need the rest
[02:54:51] doesn't really matter I guess you need
[02:54:53] crit rate for fav so technically it

[03:36:23] better wait but
[03:36:31] with you can change it just click on it
[03:36:34] wait
[03:36:36] really
[03:36:39] how
[03:36:41] oh the
[03:36:51] [ __ ] click on kaching no I mean like the
[03:36:57] artifacts click the
[03:37:00] value I'm I'm
[03:37:05] clicking I've clicked on
[03:37:09] every
[03:37:12] settings
[03:37:14] oh I don't know which I'd rather I
[03:37:22] mean oh you could do
[03:37:24] decimals top
[03:37:26] Point top point one
[03:37:32] sh 002 okay if we get 001 I come
[03:37:37] everywhere 032 kaching yo
[03:37:42] wait surely I can just make a video like
[03:37:44] this surely I can just click
[03:37:48] Godus whatever 0.1 0.10.1 0 Z1 I mean
[03:37:52] point1 sorry 01 okay but to be fair I'm
[03:37:55] pretty sure our sh ranks higher on a ER
[03:37:58] like okay cuz objectively
[03:38:01] speaking I think this circit isn't
[03:38:03] better for us but
[03:38:08] it wait I'm not even on this one that
[03:38:11] has more crit rate but I guess like
[03:38:13] attack wait but thought our build ranked
[03:38:28] higher wait wait refresh refresh refresh
[03:38:30] refresh wait I'm actually curious wait a
[03:38:32] second we need to be cuz we need to be 0
[03:38:35] we need to be even more point1 so I can
[03:38:37] make a video how I became the best sh
[03:38:42] oh cuz Oh wait we're technically the
[03:38:45] best wait a second I forgot about the
[03:38:48] editor cop dude what of my editors Samy
[03:38:51] did me he was like let me pull it
[03:38:54] up yo so like with Cloud retainer buff
[03:38:57] at full Stacks your sh has like perfect
[03:38:58] crit rate now and if they ever update on
[03:39:00] aasha you won't be getting outclassed by
[03:39:02] crit rate sweats and you don't need ER
[03:39:04] with signature right so you're number
[03:39:05] one shout now no copium now the only
[03:39:08] counterargument is the m argument but
[03:39:11] number one you you don't that's like
[03:39:13] impossible to build because you need to
[03:39:14] dodge CR all the time and number two
[03:39:16] you're not a true Shain if you're not
[03:39:17] vermilion now don't get me wrong Farm
[03:39:19] say don't Farm Vermilion but if you're a
[03:39:20] true Shia lover and and
[03:39:23] and believer you have Vermillion
[03:39:26] therefore all these [ __ ] with
[03:39:28] shenyun are overcapping on crit rate so
[03:39:29] suck my dick wait this guy's 87 crit
[03:39:36] rate okay our Sans is just objectively
[03:39:38] better our feather is
[03:39:44] also dude
[03:39:58] but okay that guy's pie are pretty
[03:40:05] good wait let me refresh [ __ ] it's still
[03:40:08] the same wait what it didn't change
[03:40:17] GG what is oh we have more teams I
[03:40:20] forgot what the [ __ ] is don't let him
[03:40:31] cook he can't accept the L no I mean 01
[03:40:35] is fine I just want to see if it's
[03:40:36] higher with ER do we have er no we
[03:40:39] don't
[03:40:44] how's your AO uh he's on the wrong build
[03:40:47] we're on [ __ ] 123 sorry where's my
[03:40:51] crit rate 125 crit rate we're not on the
[03:40:53] we're not on the right build right
[03:40:59] now whatever it doesn't
[03:41:02] matter surely a refreshes
[03:41:09] though
[03:41:15] okay it's not refreshing all good okay
[03:41:18] let's F on
[03:41:20] me log out no never rate my
[03:41:26] gradient we're not doing gradient
[03:41:28] reviews

[03:41:56] see okay we're GNA play Soo no we're not
[03:41:59] we're gonna play
[03:42:01] guming Big
[03:42:03] G um first half or second half probably
[03:42:08] first
[03:42:38] the
[03:42:41] I wish there was team presets I wish
[03:42:44] there was so
[03:42:46] much one
[03:42:54] day one
[03:42:56] day
[03:43:02] um how old are you I don't want to think
[03:43:05] about it I stopped counting Co happened
[03:43:08] and I've been this I've been locked in
[03:43:11] I locked in that's the same same year
[03:43:12] for me it's been one
[03:43:18] year but I'm 23 I think yeah I am I
[03:43:24] think with the white on
[03:43:29] top I don't know what to
[03:43:31] play
[03:43:38] nvie
[03:43:46] what do you think you'll be doing in 10
[03:43:48] years how the [ __ ] would I
[03:43:51] know I have to wait for Ser SP
[03:43:53] Stacks wait chat was I not 36% was I not
[03:43:58] the exact same number with and without
[03:44:00] ER by the way I was number 36 I'm number
[03:44:03] 36 on one build with no ER and with 120
[03:44:05] ER I'm number 36 as well bro ah it's
[03:44:09] fine
[03:44:16] it's oh it's 39 wow plus three woo but
[03:44:22] there's less people in this category
[03:44:23] know so won't it be like worse yeah see
[03:44:25] it's actually technically
[03:44:33] worse how did I kaching
[03:44:35] get whatever I'll figure
[03:44:38] outat plus three
[03:44:51] oops what are you going to do when the
[03:44:52] game
[03:44:56] ends up to it
[03:45:01] mon what will I do in the game
[03:45:06] mans
[03:45:08] retire
[03:45:12] genjin 2 aware well think about it
[03:45:15] right I mean we will be trying
[03:45:17] weathering waves but it's very clear
[03:45:20] okay think about it what is the only
[03:45:22] game so far like only it literally not
[03:45:25] close only game that has like kind
[03:45:29] of like kind of Taken genon players away
[03:45:32] from genon Star rail who made that game
[03:45:35] same company I I like there's a high
[03:45:37] likelihood they're like all right
[03:45:38] [ __ ] genon three
[03:45:40] [ __ ] it okay another game but who knows
[03:45:44] I mean I I'll play whatever I want to
[03:45:57] play it's also pretty easy like I've
[03:46:00] said this before I'll say it again it's
[03:46:02] very easy when you have a fan base for
[03:46:03] one game that's like deprived of rewards
[03:46:06] to make another game and then be
[03:46:07] generous and then the people will be
[03:46:08] like oh my God I want to try that other
[03:46:09] game like it's not not rocket science oh
[03:46:13] why are they doing it like it's pretty
[03:46:14] obvious you should still like that's not
[03:46:16] like obviously if you play get you hey
[03:46:18] we should get more too but like you know
[03:46:21] why they're doing it is it a good thing
[03:46:23] no but is it happening
[03:46:28] yes will you stream will have stream
[03:46:31] eldering by genjin
[03:46:38] 4
[03:46:45] but yeah genin doesn't have as much like
[03:46:47] actual competition whereas like thinking
[03:46:49] of Auto Battle gotas I could name I
[03:46:51] don't even play that many gotas but I
[03:46:53] could name a few and I'm sure someone
[03:46:54] who has played a lot could name a lot
[03:46:56] and I like starl but it's like it is a
[03:46:59] more competitive market than
[03:47:02] genin which I think is good it's good to
[03:47:04] have a competition which is also why
[03:47:06] it's like you want there to be other
[03:47:08] goas that succeed which is why get
[03:47:09] people are hyped for weathering waves
[03:47:10] but then like people that like like are
[03:47:12] like don't care about G like oh well now
[03:47:14] weather is going to be compared all the
[03:47:16] time yeah unfortunately it's going to

[03:47:26] of the genin killer clickbait that
[03:47:28] happens with every [ __ ] new game but

[03:47:47] kensin
[03:47:49] killer I respect the farming I do too
[03:47:52] except when it's disingenuous there's a
[03:47:54] line like most people adhere by the line
[03:47:57] like I I just don't like like when the
[03:47:59] height feels almost manufactured it's
[03:48:02] like you have to be like this is going
[03:48:04] to be the Killer and then it's not it's
[03:48:07] like dude like but I respect respect the
[03:48:09] for the most part I respect
