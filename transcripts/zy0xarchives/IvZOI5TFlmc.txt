[00:32:43] shameful like they don't want to mention
[00:32:44] that they believed
[00:32:46] and then doubters are very vocal
[00:32:50] it's kind of weird
[00:32:55] to be fair if I lose the 50 50 as long
[00:32:57] as I don't get bailu welt or Yan Chang

[00:39:41] go good Temple wait I asked for a hook
[00:39:44] and Bilu and then I literally got the
[00:39:46] two I wanted maybe it's just you have to
[00:39:47] reverse psychology maybe if you reverse
[00:39:49] psychology of the game you get what you
[00:39:51] want
[00:39:53] uh I forgot links was coming out at the
[00:39:55] same time so I didn't pre-farm but I'll
[00:39:57] level her later
[00:39:59] for now we'll level um
[00:40:01] which one
[00:40:06] dude why is she so short
[00:40:16] stop typing moments that
[00:40:21] he packs Nexus
[00:40:30] all right well that's very POG I'm happy
[00:40:32] I really need to do another Temple we
[00:40:33] got we wanted to join you after boom
[00:40:36] seeing you dying with her she's so
[00:40:38] [ __ ] short that's like you guys
[00:40:40] compare to me like I'm blade I'm blade
[00:40:42] and then you guys are [ __ ] fouchon or
[00:40:44] like links that's you guys hook
[00:40:48] accurate size accurate
[00:40:52] all right we level the [ __ ] Landau uh
[00:40:55] landau's choice because I don't have any
[00:40:57] [ __ ] light cones I don't have the
[00:40:58] simulated Universe one shut the [ __ ] up
[00:41:00] if you mention it I will literally find
[00:41:02] you and punch you off a cliff in game in
[00:41:04] game but yeah uh so I'm not gonna pull
[00:41:08] for her lycon and I can't get the
[00:41:10] simulated Universe one because for silly
[00:41:13] I have the hunt the the [ __ ] Cruising
[00:41:15] and the Stellar sea and for um that hung
[00:41:18] I have on the fall of an aeon so yeah
[00:41:21] I can't really get any more
[00:41:25] so it takes like so [ __ ] long to get
[00:41:27] more
[00:41:31] you skip that hung icon pull for
[00:41:33] fuschwan dude
[00:41:34] look I love fushron as much as the next
[00:41:37] guy I love her right I love her
[00:41:41] but I feel like pulling
[00:41:45] okay pulling for a light cone in Star
[00:41:47] rail compared to pulling for a weapon
[00:41:48] and getchin is a bit less satisfying
[00:41:50] because you don't see it when you're
[00:41:51] playing
[00:41:53] and like I'd rather get it on like a DPS
[00:41:56] character I like than on just I mean
[00:41:59] I don't know I don't really want it
[00:42:02] I don't really want it also the
[00:42:04] simulated Universe one is really good so
[00:42:05] I'll get that eventually
[00:42:12] my code's good yeah but
[00:42:15] that was better because the antigen
[00:42:16] protects team plus damage litigation I
[00:42:18] mean those situations for both I read
[00:42:20] like a giant [ __ ] post on it and I
[00:42:22] was too tired to look into it like
[00:42:24] usually when a character release I like
[00:42:26] look into them quite a lot so I know
[00:42:27] what I'm talking about but this time I
[00:42:29] was like dead so I kind of was like
[00:42:30] whatever but we'll figure it out as we
[00:42:31] go I know landau's is good though so
[00:42:33] we're using it
[00:42:34] um
[00:42:35] also I built look at look at this look
[00:42:37] at this look at this okay listen listen
[00:42:40] listen
[00:42:41] I literally pre-farmed everything I got
[00:42:43] credits I got preservation masks I
[00:42:46] leveled my relics usually usually
[00:42:47] usually my relics aren't [ __ ] leveled
[00:42:49] using my relics I don't have Relic XP so
[00:42:52] another level I pre-leveled them for
[00:42:54] fuschwan furthermore furthermore
[00:42:57] furthermore look at this [ __ ] you guys
[00:42:59] want to see how much I performed look at
[00:43:00] this [ __ ] look at this I have a one
[00:43:02] refined ether because I leveled my
[00:43:03] landau's choice Romero donated two
[00:43:06] dollars
[00:43:08] look at this pointing finger okay so do
[00:43:12] you have a favorite album or song ATM
[00:43:15] thanks for being allowed Comfort I don't
[00:43:17] but I appreciate you look usually I have
[00:43:19] look look at this 207 endurance of
[00:43:21] bronze 139 oath of Steel and the 15 of
[00:43:24] these but we're just gonna we're gonna
[00:43:25] love them okay now you're gonna be like
[00:43:27] oh oh but but your character masks
[00:43:28] usually have none okay okay watch this
[00:43:30] 37 purple 94 blue we have 132 green and
[00:43:34] we have the shop of Stardust that we can
[00:43:36] get and I can convert other Maps I need
[00:43:38] to so we're actually we're actually
[00:43:40] ready we're actually ready
[00:43:42] actually actually ready
[00:43:45] and look at these credits four mil I had
[00:43:47] like six mil but I was lovely relics
[00:43:51] will you do swarm today maybe I want to
[00:43:54] I really want to I accidentally Auto
[00:43:57] battled swarm five and one well like I
[00:43:59] didn't Auto Battle the boss but all
[00:44:00] about all the rest while I was on a
[00:44:01] train but I wanted to do it on stream so
[00:44:03] we're gonna pretend that didn't happen
[00:44:04] also I was lucky and using a cringe
[00:44:06] cringe gameplay so we're gonna do a real
[00:44:08] run on stream minus 20
[00:44:14] refund Channel points I mean Believers
[00:44:16] one
[00:44:18] should pay up yes
[00:44:19] Believers won
[00:44:23] I totally enjoyed this 20 months
[00:44:32] wait no way 79 are you [ __ ] kidding
[00:44:37] okay whatever I mean good enough dude I
[00:44:39] don't care dude 79 it is what it is it
[00:44:42] literally is what it is okay who cares
[00:44:44] who [ __ ] cares
[00:44:47] dude I didn't do the exact math but I
[00:44:49] guesstimated it 79 is fine okay it's
[00:44:52] literally fine
[00:44:54] oh we can I think we're guaranteed a
[00:44:55] four star now on the standard Banner
[00:44:57] let's go to four star because we did six
[00:44:58] pulls this is three so surely there's
[00:45:00] one that we did before
[00:45:03] if not I'll spend Jades [ __ ] it
[00:45:05] please
[00:45:07] okay
[00:45:08] I'm not spending J's on a [ __ ]
[00:45:10] standard Banner dude I need one pull
[00:45:12] can I level links let's see
[00:45:16] [ __ ]
[00:45:18] no okay wait wait wait wait wait wait
[00:45:20] nameless daughter nameless honor boom
[00:45:22] boom I'll get all good I'll get all good
[00:45:25] all good all good
[00:45:33] do I gotta pull from that yes I do
[00:45:36] I could have just saved and done a
[00:45:37] temple and that would have been better
[00:45:38] content but all good boom now we're
[00:45:40] guaranteed a four star what will we get
[00:45:44] I'm just gonna skip
[00:45:46] oh I mean oh we already have her oh
[00:45:53] that's what it is
[00:45:59] wanna use damn introduction set because
[00:46:00] surely we don't need it surely we don't
[00:46:02] need that much [ __ ] damage reduction
[00:46:03] surely I'm not that much of a baby that
[00:46:05] I need damage reduction to not die
[00:46:06] surely I'm stronger than that surely I'm
[00:46:08] bigger better faster stronger
[00:46:11] surely I'm not a [ __ ] baby
[00:46:13] but we can level either set like Fusion
[00:46:15] has a lot of different build paths I'm
[00:46:17] kind of not sure which one I want to run
[00:46:19] um but if we want to use that one the
[00:46:21] damage reduction at least two piece we
[00:46:23] can
[00:46:24] I just don't really think I need to
[00:46:26] wait where the [ __ ] is it it looks like
[00:46:27] uh
[00:46:28] I have boots on someone what are the
[00:46:30] boots I thought I had them I might have
[00:46:32] thrown them away
[00:46:33] what the [ __ ] is it
[00:46:39] do I not have any the [ __ ] maybe I don't
[00:46:41] have any oh there wait
[00:46:43] yeah there it is
[00:46:47] anyways let me get my shot
[00:46:49] so we're gonna do we're gonna remove all
[00:46:52] of Marsh's pieces
[00:46:54] boom
[00:46:55] boom and then we're gonna put them all
[00:46:56] on fouchon Shirley when I do recommended
[00:46:59] gear is going to put it on no the [ __ ]
[00:47:01] it didn't but it put a few of the pieces
[00:47:02] which is not bad
[00:47:05] um right now we're doing two piece two
[00:47:06] piece
[00:47:08] and I'm not doing okay so I was debating
[00:47:10] if I want to do SUB DPS or just full
[00:47:12] tank and then we're gonna do full tank
[00:47:13] for now
[00:47:14] and uh we'll see what happens but we're
[00:47:16] doing full tank we have a pretty good
[00:47:18] flower a lot of actress you know some
[00:47:19] speed some HP we got a pretty good
[00:47:21] pretty good pretty good glovey well it's
[00:47:23] not the best but speed affected rate HP
[00:47:25] only Plus 12.
[00:47:27] we've got a body boom some speed as well
[00:47:31] uh I forgot what my boots are it's HP
[00:47:35] roasted flower dudes [ __ ] you
[00:47:38] why am I why am I toxic right now I
[00:47:40] don't know okay
[00:47:44] anyways for now we have wait why am I
[00:47:46] one three three speed no I definitely
[00:47:48] have more wait wait chill chill chill
[00:47:49] chill wait chill
[00:47:51] wait [ __ ] okay we need it might be
[00:47:53] enough because it's one two three three
[00:47:55] with like decimals right it might be
[00:47:56] enough it might be enough but yeah hey
[00:48:00] yo yo okay if it isn't though I'm pretty
[00:48:03] sure it is because our our March had one
[00:48:05] three five
[00:48:07] whatever it's fine we can also level so
[00:48:09] this has speed and we could get a speed
[00:48:10] roll there and this has
[00:48:12] this could get a speed roll watch us
[00:48:15] watch this watch us are you ready we're
[00:48:17] about to get a speed roll watch watch
[00:48:19] watch press one if you believe what if
[00:48:21] you believe two if you don't believe
[00:48:22] well what can I throw away uh that's
[00:48:24] good that's good that's good [ __ ] these
[00:48:26] are all good
[00:48:28] maybe this Loki who would use this
[00:48:30] like Ting Yoon kind of not really she's
[00:48:33] gonna want speed
[00:48:35] I guess I could keep it just think I
[00:48:36] mean
[00:48:37] now I can keep it this is really good
[00:48:39] this is really good well actually it's
[00:48:42] an attack [ __ ] sphere it might not be
[00:48:43] that good actually
[00:48:50] [ __ ] it that's that's no X
[00:48:55] 1 pm gearing dead
[00:48:58] can I throw this would you be mad at me
[00:48:59] if I throw this
[00:49:01] would anyone be mattified through this
[00:49:07] no yeah
[00:49:10] because it's attack it's not like an
[00:49:11] element like uh like lightning or
[00:49:13] anything so throw the attackers yeah but
[00:49:15] if I have enough speed I'm like [ __ ]
[00:49:20] I have one more chance at a speed roll
[00:49:24] one if I don't get a speed roll I'm
[00:49:26] [ __ ] stuck I guess I could change my
[00:49:28] flower but or my my head but I'm stuck
[00:49:30] on 133
[00:49:31] are my invivors also one through three
[00:49:33] but I'm pretty sure we have the decimal
[00:49:35] like it's one through three point nine
[00:49:36] or something like surely
[00:49:38] [ __ ] okay wait wait wait wait wait
[00:49:41] we need
[00:49:44] to get a speed roll here when you make a
[00:49:46] guide okay no but I'll make a guide for
[00:49:48] the next character who's jingling you
[00:49:49] probably because I was like sick so I'm
[00:49:52] like [ __ ] it I can't
[00:49:53] so I'm apologies but there's a bunch of
[00:49:56] good ones so don't worry
[00:49:58] this looks no I mean
[00:50:01] I have nothing okay let's just Auto I
[00:50:02] should have enough
[00:50:06] that's not how Speed Works [ __ ] you okay
[00:50:08] [ __ ] you
[00:50:16] okay well
[00:50:21] we might have a better ball we might
[00:50:23] have a better ball I I ideally we get a
[00:50:25] piece like I could craft another err
[00:50:26] rope right now I could like force and
[00:50:28] plant and then hopefully we got like we
[00:50:29] got like good Subs we got like speed we
[00:50:31] got like HP defense like we become
[00:50:34] tankier does that make sense press press
[00:50:35] one four nine two nine nine eight one
[00:50:37] two one if that makes sense look we'll
[00:50:39] go we'll go make one right now we'll go
[00:50:40] make one how the [ __ ] should I wait
[00:50:42] synthesize
[00:50:53] seeding before should I do it stream
[00:50:56] oh do I want HP actually
[00:50:58] surely I want err right
[00:51:02] I don't need to do it I can just do
[00:51:03] normal but
[00:51:06] I think I really want to go ER I really
[00:51:08] want to [ __ ] ah [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it
[00:51:11] [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it
[00:51:18] [ __ ] it
[00:51:26] so it has crit damage which means our
[00:51:29] bronya could use it our brain is on this
[00:51:33] so technically technically speaking
[00:51:36] technically speaking
[00:51:38] our bradio could use it
[00:51:41] let's see
[00:51:44] effectra is not actually not bad
[00:51:46] actually not bad actually not bad
[00:51:53] let's see let's see
[00:51:56] okay
[00:51:58] that's one can we get another
[00:52:00] one more
[00:52:02] one more now literally POG trap
[00:52:03] everywhere I will literally pop
[00:52:07] dude look at this dude okay nope I need
[00:52:09] to careful for my throat look at this
[00:52:11] our ball has 2900 damage and our [ __ ]
[00:52:14] rope at 12 or radio 17. so even if at 15
[00:52:17] it doesn't roll we're fine we're [ __ ]
[00:52:19] big chilling
[00:52:21] not easy
[00:52:23] Meanwhile my my gloves are um I know my
[00:52:27] boots are plus six
[00:52:29] this okay I have two running builds I
[00:52:31] have a very fast one a very slow one
[00:52:33] because right now my blade is slow as
[00:52:34] [ __ ] so I need to be 104 but then when
[00:52:37] my dad hung I go faster well I still
[00:52:39] have to be slower than him but yeah
[00:52:41] anyways
[00:52:46] all right let's level some [ __ ]
[00:52:56] yay I love traces
[00:52:58] bad chest
[00:53:13] hmm
[00:53:32] don't need to level this I mean it's
[00:53:33] killed on her HP so like that's all I
[00:53:36] guess
[00:53:39] I might as well
[00:53:49] okay well dude I have so much [ __ ]
[00:53:51] effectors on her
[00:53:55] uh we'll do we'll make
[00:54:01] ultimate basically just damage I know
[00:54:03] but
[00:54:04] yeah I mean I guess they're just less
[00:54:05] important
[00:54:11] okay I'll level this how much does this
[00:54:13] increase of crit rate by well that's
[00:54:14] actually quite a bit
[00:54:16] that's a lot actually holy [ __ ]
[00:54:18] holy [ __ ] that's [ __ ] 0.7 per level
[00:54:23] oh my God jeepers
[00:54:25] that is so cool
[00:54:28] oh my God
[00:54:35] I want this Trace but this costs [ __ ]
[00:54:38] eight and then another eight
[00:54:44] I guess you might as well get this
[00:54:53] all right now everything we need is
[00:54:54] purple right so I can just make purple
[00:54:55] sorry let's make rules
[00:54:58] why did you read my chat maybe because
[00:55:00] maybe because it was a bad chat you ever
[00:55:02] think about that not all Chatters are
[00:55:03] created equal maybe your message was
[00:55:05] [ __ ] dumb huh matter of fact let me
[00:55:08] go see
[00:55:09] can you act normal have you on speaker
[00:55:10] no
[00:55:11] sorry
[00:55:13] where is it why don't you read my chat
[00:55:15] sad sad sad
[00:55:16] are you always this toxic yo I'm not
[00:55:20] toxic
[00:55:21] he streamed later it's midnight what is
[00:55:22] the ah
[00:55:24] I'm gonna ban you no I'm not one second
[00:55:26] timeout to think about your actions when
[00:55:28] you're unbanned please apologize
[00:55:30] and explain how you reformed as a
[00:55:32] chatter
[00:55:42] minus one second
[00:55:45] I need more purples of these two
[00:55:52] okay uh chat should I get this to level
[00:55:59] should I get nine nine
[00:56:01] [ __ ] it I guess well this dude this
[00:56:03] costs so much for eight percent of three
[00:56:04] but it was a lot
[00:56:06] yeah [ __ ] it whatever
[00:56:08] yeah
[00:56:18] okay good enough for now
[00:56:25] get the last crit rate Trace I mean
[00:56:29] we could get this one
[00:56:31] I kind of want to make her like do
[00:56:33] damage but I probably shouldn't I should
[00:56:35] probably make sure she has some amount
[00:56:36] of Defense
[00:56:38] um but I kind of focused on giving her a
[00:56:40] bunch of HP and speed but it's hard dude
[00:56:42] I I Can't Get Enough speed man
[00:56:45] I need one speed
[00:56:47] I could have went speed boots I guess
[00:56:49] but
[00:56:50] do I have speed widths
[00:56:52] I have good Subs no I mean 11.
[00:56:57] but Speedos are like low-key excessive
[00:57:05] now we're fine we'll just do um
[00:57:08] well actually let me look at my gloves
[00:57:10] how much speed is this six
[00:57:17] shot I know I said I was geared before I
[00:57:19] started stream but I I I I would like to
[00:57:23] retract that statement
[00:57:27] hey one sec
[00:57:33] as long as defense and speed it's not HP
[00:57:35] though
[00:57:38] it's not as HP no speed right we are
[00:57:41] used to it don't worry okay [ __ ] you
[00:57:45] wow hitter rate yes I can't wait to get
[00:57:49] more hit rate rolls wow that is so cool
[00:57:56] to 25 reduced okay oh speed wait that's
[00:58:00] actually better
[00:58:02] and Jack
[00:58:06] wait chat do you use this instead now we
[00:58:07] have more than uh we have enough speed
[00:58:09] we have 136 which is enough the only
[00:58:12] problem
[00:58:13] is we lose
[00:58:16] chat he's not actually sick 16 effectres
[00:58:19] which is quite a lot flying because he's
[00:58:22] late as always
[00:58:39] gearing sleep

[01:00:48] shop
[01:00:59] all right we're good
[01:01:05] those are probably the worst roles
[01:01:07] possible
[01:01:08] um we need more defense but at least we
[01:01:10] have a lot of HP and a good amount of
[01:01:11] speed so we're fine for now we can play
[01:01:13] this for Sean and then we could make uh
[01:01:16] changes to her if we need to
[01:01:18] fog
[01:01:21] all right what should we do first I want
[01:01:22] to marry chaos but I think we should
[01:01:24] start with something else that's like
[01:01:25] more chill
[01:01:27] let me let me Auto Battle something or
[01:01:29] maybe disability Universe actually
[01:01:31] um
[01:01:32] maybe do su and then memory chaos and
[01:01:35] then swarm
[01:01:38] yeah let's do that
[01:01:50] wait chat should we play her like or is
[01:01:52] our only [ __ ] healer like our only
[01:01:54] defensive option what do you guys think
[01:01:56] what should we do
[01:01:57] what do I feel like doing wait let me do
[01:01:59] world uh
[01:02:01] the world seven
[01:02:06] I will play her with
[01:02:15] this
[01:02:16] seems pretty cracked
[01:02:20] mono Quantum no you I mean it's not bad
[01:02:22] but why would I play Sealy I have
[01:02:24] [ __ ] blade and his [ __ ] is bigger so
[01:02:31] but this is basically mono whatever
[01:02:33] because this thing has uh Quantum
[01:02:35] weakness we could just implant a wind
[01:02:37] like We'll always implant wind so it's
[01:02:40] basically Mono Wind I guess
[01:02:45] but I need to make my brownie oh she has
[01:02:46] low speed all right easy 200 crit damage
[01:02:49] all right let's go we're gonna do this
[01:02:51] then we're gonna do memory chaos and
[01:02:52] then we're gonna do swarm world five I
[01:02:54] think
[01:02:55] but I feel like playing uh
[01:02:58] remember this is too weird I don't like
[01:03:00] remembers we'll just
[01:03:07] abundance dude I don't want to do

[01:08:38] else
[01:08:47] why do you hate normal speed dude I
[01:08:49] literally
[01:08:50] it doesn't even feel real anymore like
[01:08:53] normal speed it feels like you're
[01:08:54] purposefully slowing it down look at
[01:08:55] this
[01:08:56] it feels so slow now dude look
[01:09:04] dude
[01:09:19] this is pretty good but we don't want it
[01:09:20] because we want damage
[01:09:26] well at least you can uh increase our
[01:09:28] follow-up attack damage and are all
[01:09:30] damaged that's cool
[01:09:32] Fortune glue we take it
[01:09:42] blade build please uh we're on [ __ ]
[01:09:45] Vermilion
[01:09:50] I mean Blaze Billy's build is pretty
[01:09:52] clear you just go the [ __ ] set that's
[01:09:53] made for him and then there's a few two
[01:09:55] pieces like salsodo or the other one
[01:09:57] rudolence
[01:09:59] all right curio we always Gamble
[01:10:13] oh nice
[01:10:24] whoa
[01:10:26] in what world
[01:10:37] how does that even
[01:10:42] though it's creation
[01:10:46] oh 11k
[01:10:49] um
[01:10:53] [Music]
[01:10:54] you think we're sort of prevent a skill
[01:10:56] issue but no okay
[01:10:58] [ __ ] you
[01:11:09] surely we've got a hot one there you go
[01:11:15] foreign
[01:11:19] here's what I thought
[01:11:35] savor it for me we'll probably do
[01:11:38] um
[01:11:39] the last Moc at the end like after this
[01:11:43] and then we'll do um
[01:11:44] probably do something five with
[01:11:46] destruction I don't know I kind of want
[01:11:48] to play destruction it's pretty fun
[01:11:51] Elites
[01:11:55] although I kind of want to clear with
[01:11:56] every path favorite I think remembrance
[01:11:58] is the most like stupid
[01:12:00] but yeah
[01:12:09] I know I took that
[01:12:25] foreign
[01:12:26] have you completed it yes but let's
[01:12:28] pretend I didn't because I like Loki
[01:12:30] Auto Battle without paying attention on
[01:12:31] the train and then I got to the boss and
[01:12:33] I tried and then I won but I want to I
[01:12:35] wanted to save it for streams so we're
[01:12:36] gonna act like I didn't clear it it was
[01:12:38] only once and I want to clear with
[01:12:39] everything so it's like I didn't
[01:12:56] where's plink at the plank died the cat
[01:12:59] in the plink emote is no longer with us
[01:13:06] well if it's not that hard to have
[01:13:07] things unlocked yeah that's the cool
[01:13:08] part I didn't have things unlocked
[01:13:11] because I feel like if I just Farm other
[01:13:13] worlds to get unlocks that's cringe and
[01:13:15] then that what type of achievement is it
[01:13:17] so we cleared five already but I'll do
[01:13:19] it again with the same unlocks before we
[01:13:21] get the new world [ __ ] I missed
[01:13:25] like what the [ __ ] is plink
[01:13:31] I guess playing just fine
[01:13:35] how did you miss dude I've been getting
[01:13:36] impatient I've started missing [ __ ]
[01:13:38] vanity when the [ __ ] do I miss benedee
[01:13:40] when does anyone Miss vanity I I think
[01:13:43] I'm just impatient now I don't care
[01:13:44] anymore
[01:13:45] I need to stop pressing you
[01:14:02] why did I lock onto everything except my
[01:14:05] Fusion
[01:14:22] okay okay
[01:14:24] then we took no [ __ ] damage
[01:14:34] wait I wonder if when I do swarm
[01:14:38] when we do a swarm we'll probably play
[01:14:39] the ultra and pushon right no way we're
[01:14:42] no way we need more damage I feel like
[01:14:44] I feel like an inch Farm you just get
[01:14:46] [ __ ] probably play both
[01:15:04] bro why is this break effect
[01:15:08] you see why my dad hung build sucks I
[01:15:10] can't I can't I just get
[01:15:13] well at least we could use this maybe no
[01:15:15] we can't I mean
[01:15:26] okay oh uh
[01:15:29] all right
[01:15:31] that happened
[01:15:37] what's up her though
[01:15:40] give me a curio
[01:15:44] [ __ ] it
[01:15:45] okay
[01:15:52] dude that Hound sucks too no we are not
[01:15:54] the same don't don't act like I'm
[01:15:56] relatable my that hung is still cracked
[01:15:58] his ratio is insane without a crit
[01:16:00] weapon uh like cone it's just I don't
[01:16:01] have the right two piece inner that's it
[01:16:03] I should have Reuben Arena that's all
[01:16:04] he's still he's still not bad all of his
[01:16:06] pieces are insane it's just they're not
[01:16:08] I don't have the right set that's all it
[01:16:09] just is what it is that's all
[01:16:11] that's all
[01:16:15] who asked I asked
[01:16:18] I asked
[01:16:24] wow
[01:16:38] the [ __ ] is this 10 Cosmic fragments and
[01:16:40] get a tantalizing reward oh
[01:16:43] that is pretty tantalizing
[01:16:46] oh [ __ ]
[01:16:49] it only costs 10 fragments
[01:16:54] I'm broke though
[01:16:55] I can't even enhance this one
[01:17:06] I could if I want to put like and
[01:17:09] physical MC here and keep at it keep at
[01:17:12] it but I kind of don't care so we're not
[01:17:14] gonna do that
[01:17:18] always
[01:17:21] show your courage
[01:17:25] speed boost on ill I can't okay you're
[01:17:27] weird
[01:17:28] you don't need to be slow for a
[01:17:30] character that use a lot of skill points
[01:17:31] that's not how it works you just need to
[01:17:32] be slower than your supports
[01:17:36] other than brania
[01:17:42] watch us watch this watch this damage
[01:17:54] can I have this come that needs this is
[01:17:56] double speed
[01:18:12] probably at first but it doesn't matter
[01:18:15] the place easy when it comes out yeah
[01:18:17] for sure I'll at least try it it looks
[01:18:19] fun
[01:18:21] Paradise
[01:18:30] this is double speed
[01:18:37] third hoyo game aware that we won't be
[01:18:40] addicted though like we go just play
[01:18:42] like we'll play game like a little bit
[01:18:43] like we can stop whenever
[01:18:48] I I really wanted to support you for a
[01:18:51] while because I've been watching you for
[01:18:52] a while but it's hard for me to catch
[01:18:54] your streams because of time my dad made
[01:18:56] food I love love your videos
[01:19:00] that's what all Gamba dicks say yeah but
[01:19:02] it's not it's not get okay it's not
[01:19:05] gambling if we don't spend
[01:19:07] when's the last time I spent on anything
[01:19:15] I appreciate you this car
[01:19:22] savor it for me
[01:19:25] five minutes ago
[01:19:28] okay that's you have no proof
[01:19:31] if anything I topped up before starting
[01:19:33] stream so there's no evidence
[01:19:37] is my skill active yeah
[01:19:39] no it isn't I should have checked
[01:19:55] I didn't check
[01:19:58] foreign
[01:20:04] okay that's fine
[01:20:06] okay that's fine
[01:20:12] idiot dude it happens to the best of us
[01:20:16] trust me I'm the best of us we don't die
[01:20:20] here we don't die here
[01:20:21] we don't die here we're fine yeah we're
[01:20:24] fine
[01:20:34] we've entered the storm what is the dude
[01:20:36] why does the deer use the same [ __ ]
[01:20:38] follow-up attack as blade
[01:20:40] is there a lore here that I'm missing
[01:20:45] more enemies
[01:20:56] we could definitely Auto Battle this I
[01:20:57] don't know why I'm like manually
[01:20:58] clicking but here's what it is
[01:21:07] laughs
[01:21:09] I see through you
[01:21:17] equipped it together as one
[01:21:22] all things humans what if the deers
[01:21:25] ambivalent of the Nations they both have
[01:21:26] horns yeah but it's not the same
[01:21:27] animations
[01:21:28] the deer has the same [ __ ] animations
[01:21:30] as our blade
[01:21:34] the paradise savor it for me okay I'll
[01:21:37] save it for you okay
[01:21:45] more enemies
[01:21:48] thought about this
[01:21:50] is double speed
[01:21:52] is that why you play blade why
[01:21:55] because he's a deer
[01:22:05] okay bug
[01:22:07] we just did that together oh my God I
[01:22:08] hit my mic we just did that to get
[01:22:09] rewards now we can do the actual content
[01:22:11] uh anything good pulse trap ball strap
[01:22:15] no unfortunate actually the attack rope
[01:22:18] could be good he's attack rope probably
[01:22:20] should have locked it that's not good
[01:22:21] also not good
[01:22:23] unlucky
[01:22:32] all right cool
[01:22:34] all right memory account
[01:22:37] bat chest
[01:22:40] so you think Auto Battle memory chaos
[01:22:43] I mean I auto battled one to seven I
[01:22:45] think about eight nine ten
[01:22:49] we'll do swarm
[01:22:52] surely right
[01:23:07] all right [ __ ] it we're gonna do imbiber
[01:23:10] no we'll do blade we'll do blade for
[01:23:12] Sean
[01:23:14] played brania fishron silveroff
[01:23:16] and then second off we'll do
[01:23:19] buy better
[01:23:28] uh
[01:23:34] what else
[01:23:37] probably pillow for being honest
[01:23:52] yeah probably where the [ __ ] is pillow
[01:23:55] which is is she geared
[01:23:57] she is she's just another icon who the
[01:23:59] [ __ ] has the icon also Rolf
[01:24:01] oh we can use the wolf this light cone
[01:24:05] and then we'll take this repeal this we
[01:24:07] can alts
[01:24:12] driving off HP no should be fine
[01:24:24] show your courage
[01:24:27] all right should carry out so I'm gonna
[01:24:29] go pee but if we dive then it's her
[01:24:32] fault
[01:24:32] it is not mine okay give me a minute
[01:24:38] I have no doubt that we won't die
[01:24:50] foreign
[01:25:27] attract
[01:25:29] to guard and defense crush them
[01:25:50] and
[01:25:54] you failed
[01:25:59] savor it for me
[01:26:02] okay
[01:26:07] lengthen your strength

[01:26:20] am I dead shot or not wait it's easy
[01:26:24] oh am I Frozen
[01:26:28] this is blade basic attacks without e
[01:26:33] average socks gameplay
[01:26:44] crush them
[01:26:46] life's kind of low it's concerning all
[01:26:48] right we win so it's fine
[01:26:51] nice
[01:26:54] nice we did it
[01:27:05] repay repent
[01:27:18] I heck and love Auto battling

[01:27:38] oh dude Pila okay peela's actually
[01:27:40] [ __ ]
[01:27:42] surely surely the AI in Auto Battle
[01:27:44] doesn't spam peel a skill when I don't
[01:27:46] need to right
[01:27:49] surely surely we're not spamming Pila
[01:27:51] skill
[01:27:52] surely not
[01:27:54] [ __ ]
[01:27:58] fine
[01:28:11] all about so dumb it is oh Auto Battle

[01:28:17] it no it isn't I haven't made I haven't
[01:28:19] made a single mistake playing this game
[01:28:21] ever

[01:28:44] oh my God peel is always the one target
[01:28:49] very cool

[01:29:40] food upstairs I just don't feel like
[01:29:42] going out to eat don't worry
[01:29:48] Instagram

[01:29:54] webcam I hope you get better soon wait
[01:29:55] do I not sound sick
[01:29:57] maybe I just feel like [ __ ] I feel like
[01:29:59] you can hear like my left nostril is
[01:30:00] plugged
[01:30:02] is it not Audible
[01:30:04] no not really wait really yes
[01:30:08] I just have like no energy you're not
[01:30:11] more like
[01:30:13] yeah
[01:30:14] all good I mean at least it doesn't
[01:30:15] sound bad that's cool
[01:30:18] I hope your bed is warm on both sides
[01:30:20] dude what did I do
[01:30:23] why would he say that
[01:30:26] and you're aggro today what does that
[01:30:29] mean
[01:30:30] do I get aggro when I'm sick
[01:30:40] yep
[01:30:52] oh [ __ ] they're actually a normal attack
[01:30:53] on well I guess I said no skill points
[01:30:55] that's the only reason
[01:30:57] he's not like something is stuck in your
[01:30:59] throat dude I wish what
[01:31:08] I don't know why I said that I'm sorry
[01:31:10] I'm sorry I've been playing too much
[01:31:13] that hun
[01:31:14] too much and by bitter all right nice
[01:31:16] what about it
[01:31:24] oh Kafka booba
[01:31:27] uh we probably just send it again I
[01:31:30] think we okay we're gonna we're gonna do
[01:31:31] nine and ten
[01:31:33] to showcase the power of fuschwan with
[01:31:36] imbibator and blade
[01:31:39] and then we'll go to swarm five is what
[01:31:42] I think my plan is
[01:31:44] would you like to enter the Forgotten
[01:31:46] Hall
[01:31:51] so we're gonna do for a second off we're
[01:31:52] gonna do blade
[01:31:54] with brania and the first half
[01:31:57] we have Loki nothing that's wicked
[01:31:59] implant uh
[01:32:03] wait blade first actually not be bad
[01:32:05] wait I have a new idea we do dad hung
[01:32:09] second
[01:32:10] and then first you could do blade
[01:32:13] brania
[01:32:15] silver fouchon and then we're guaranteed
[01:32:17] to implant wind here and we're
[01:32:19] guaranteed to implant Quantum here it's
[01:32:21] like oh there's already wind implemented
[01:32:22] so like we can we can spray both
[01:32:24] and then for second half we do
[01:32:27] in vibrator
[01:32:36] and then
[01:32:38] last thought doesn't really matter
[01:32:41] bench Jin Yuen smog dude he's not
[01:32:44] benched
[01:32:45] he's just look look at his build look at
[01:32:47] his build it's actually not even bad
[01:32:48] look at this we have we have
[01:32:52] [Music]
[01:32:55] it's temporary it'll get better soon can
[01:32:57] also play Kafka actually I forgot what
[01:32:59] Kafka my kafka's geared pretty well but
[01:33:01] I think these teams work uh second half
[01:33:03] we'll play uh who should the last slot
[01:33:05] be
[01:33:06] probably probably pillow again feels
[01:33:08] pretty good
[01:33:11] shame on you man dude what did I do
[01:33:29] stop
[01:33:31] bro okay the first two I did on purpose
[01:33:34] the third one I wanted it to hit oh good
[01:33:39] the first two was on purpose but then
[01:33:41] the third one I was looking at him oh
[01:33:43] good yeah I should have waited for the
[01:33:44] Target
[01:33:56] why do you say peel inside a pillow did
[01:33:58] pillow I don't know pillow sounds better
[01:34:00] I might convert I might start saying
[01:34:01] Pella and guides but
[01:34:04] dude I saw someone get mad at me because
[01:34:06] I was saying Animo instead of I mean
[01:34:07] like Animo
[01:34:09] they commented like after the fifth time
[01:34:12] you said at Nemo I have to x out of the
[01:34:14] video I can't watch this anymore it's
[01:34:24] isn't it payLo okay that's even worse
[01:34:32] yin and yang yep
[01:34:37] you could be the Yin tomayank
[01:34:40] that was terrible I'm sorry
[01:34:54] a negative rizzler
[01:34:58] dude it's actually positive rizz
[01:35:00] it's actually positive rizz it's priz
[01:35:03] wait let me see have I have I done
[01:35:06] anything recently that's worth talking
[01:35:07] about let me see let's see
[01:35:15] savor it for me
[01:35:24] come on
[01:35:32] so let me watch our push one who's
[01:35:34] better I love that question
[01:35:39] please it's day one but please please
[01:35:41] tell me please
[01:35:49] answer the question okay team one team
[01:35:52] two you're welcome
[01:35:53] who the [ __ ] wants to play Natalie or
[01:35:56] bailu when you have both of them
[01:36:03] come on it's not even close
[01:36:07] lugotra gives you like a stupid a stupid
[01:36:10] amount of healing without ever using
[01:36:12] your skill ever which is really really
[01:36:13] nice
[01:36:15] um which one gives you a bunch of crit
[01:36:16] rate though which is also really nice so
[01:36:19] if you don't need
[01:36:22] and like some crowd control resist
[01:36:25] which is also really nice so
[01:36:32] I think they're both really good if you
[01:36:34] don't need like in theory let's say you
[01:36:35] like don't need
[01:36:38] um
[01:36:41] which has like the auto cleanse where
[01:36:44] he's like well like with a skill but he
[01:36:46] can also like heal and cleanse not even
[01:36:47] using a skill so like Lucha really
[01:36:49] really skill point efficient
[01:36:51] um which is very pog
[01:36:54] but Fusion is great as well and like in
[01:36:57] theory if you don't need the like the
[01:36:58] crowd control resistance is really nice
[01:36:59] but in theory if you don't need the
[01:37:02] the cleanse and you don't you can spare
[01:37:05] like you can use a skill or whatever and
[01:37:07] you don't need more healing than the
[01:37:09] crit rate you gain from fuschwan would
[01:37:10] probably be
[01:37:12] like better
[01:37:14] I don't want to say better as like a
[01:37:15] better character but better as in like
[01:37:17] you would get damage from that
[01:37:27] yeah link seems really good but I
[01:37:29] haven't played links yet so I can't
[01:37:31] speak
[01:37:32] I wish I did this like half patch I was
[01:37:35] like not feeling it so I couldn't look
[01:37:36] into the characters as much as I usually
[01:37:37] do which I probably will for the next
[01:37:39] manner but yeah
[01:37:52] wow
[01:38:08] wait how often Chad how often do you
[01:38:10] need to skill on fushon
[01:38:13] or how often do you want to
[01:38:21] number three
[01:38:24] ah
[01:38:25] blood cleansing track okay that makes
[01:38:27] sense
[01:38:29] skill basically basic skill yeah
[01:38:34] okay that makes sense
[01:38:38] that's pretty I mean
[01:38:42] that's that is very like that is pretty
[01:38:44] skill point efficient I guess if you
[01:38:45] have that hung though if you're doing
[01:38:47] like because it's kind of like Ting Yoon
[01:38:49] and like peel well looking ocula like
[01:38:51] kind of like a rope where you can skill
[01:38:52] once to implant and then just Auto
[01:38:53] attack
[01:38:54] but
[01:38:56] I feel like if you have if you're using
[01:38:57] that hung in like another team then
[01:38:59] you'd probably and you have the
[01:39:00] wheelchair you probably put the Watcher
[01:39:01] with Dan Hong and then push onto the
[01:39:03] other team
[01:39:04] [Music]
[01:39:20] Auto Battle
[01:39:26] dude [ __ ] okay whatever I mean pillow's
[01:39:29] too squishy can we put pillow with the
[01:39:30] blade team maybe we put pillow with
[01:39:32] blade because because cuz cuz and then
[01:39:39] okay we're gonna give pillow I'm gonna
[01:39:41] do the Forbidden Tech of giving my peel
[01:39:43] up how much did you just have HP
[01:39:47] okay we're on a crit rate body I'm gonna
[01:39:48] give her HP body
[01:39:55] I don't have a [ __ ] HP body leveled
[01:40:06] what if I what if I give her the
[01:40:07] Forbidden Tech of running a five star
[01:40:09] light cone so I get more bass dots
[01:40:14] surely not right
[01:40:17] who am I dying
[01:40:24] it will be fine
[01:40:31] okay fine maybe we swap the teams or
[01:40:33] maybe I just don't Auto Battle but I
[01:40:35] want to be a thought about it
[01:40:52] my pillar has Kafka icon smile smile
[01:41:10] on Kafka fight he couldn't do anything
[01:41:12] yeah I wasn't really paying attention
[01:41:15] just autoing
[01:41:16] but we could also run two cleansers
[01:41:20] but surely that doesn't happen again
[01:41:21] right also haven't I own the [ __ ]
[01:41:24] effectra is lycon
[01:41:26] um
[01:41:27] okay
[01:41:32] maybe just run it back
[01:41:49] use links she's level 20. aware
[01:41:55] what if we what if we bring to you why
[01:41:56] don't we just normal attack to get skill
[01:41:58] points and we don't actually do anything
[01:42:07] we could bring a second cleanser just
[01:42:08] [ __ ] bring because we don't need more
[01:42:10] damage our damage is fine so we could
[01:42:12] just bring another cleanser if we want
[01:42:15] because like realistically our damage is
[01:42:17] like more than enough even without Pila
[01:42:30] that's worse than being benched
[01:42:34] it's not
[01:42:35] I push one time bad chest
[01:42:52] the person that said they're waiting for
[01:42:54] my guy to build bushwan I'm sorry I was
[01:42:57] too dead to look into her before release
[01:42:58] because I was traveling and I felt like
[01:42:59] [ __ ] so I can't uh but there will be a
[01:43:02] guy for the next character and if you're
[01:43:03] wondering how to build her right now you
[01:43:05] could if you want to just be a full tank
[01:43:06] you go HP enough speed to go as often as
[01:43:08] you want usually one three four and then
[01:43:10] defense and effect drives are nice too
[01:43:12] the fans can help you be tankier
[01:43:15] and then HP is for your skillings and if
[01:43:17] you wanted to be and you could go err
[01:43:19] rope
[01:43:21] um yeah you can do one piece of defense
[01:43:23] or sub stats
[01:43:29] and if you want to build I I yeah
[01:43:35] what up Rick how you been rare day
[01:43:37] stream yeah rare day stream
[01:43:41] is she a good pull for a relatively new
[01:43:44] player yes
[01:43:45] I mean if you're new you probably don't
[01:43:47] have blue Ocho or Japan and if you don't
[01:43:50] have Lucha or Japan then what the [ __ ]
[01:43:51] are your healers Natalie and I guess
[01:43:54] links now is a character
[01:43:56] but I think Lewis and push on are like
[01:43:59] pretty high value
[01:44:01] but it's day one so just
[01:44:04] bear with me here
[01:44:18] you should see stops are useful
[01:44:19] basically yes but defense is good too so
[01:44:20] you're not because you want to absorb as
[01:44:22] much damage as possible
[01:44:24] so you want to be as tanky as possible
[01:44:27] because
[01:44:28] the night blade just do a [ __ ] hat
[01:44:31] for me
[01:44:41] thank you Auto Battle
[01:44:44] is future on the day of star rail bat
[01:44:46] chest yes yes
[01:44:52] we just implanted nothing
[01:45:01] this is the type of music they play in
[01:45:02] Walmart there's no way you're
[01:45:04] disrespecting Ransom by little tekka
[01:45:08] this song is not even bad
[01:45:22] that's not even true
[01:45:25] you guys are just saying true to
[01:45:27] anything
[01:45:31] my thumbnails that look like yours on
[01:45:33] YouTube yeah it happens
[01:45:38] that's why I have to be faster
[01:45:40] I upload so slow recently but it's okay
[01:45:43] for for Nev yet we'll be it will be very
[01:45:45] fast
[01:45:46] and then for Jing Liu
[01:45:49] although star rail is harder for me
[01:45:50] because there's still a lot I'm like
[01:45:51] learning
[01:45:54] getcher it feels like second nature to
[01:45:55] me now but starall there's a lot I'm
[01:45:57] still learning
[01:46:12] poor cleansing track

[01:48:36] okay
[01:48:39] I will lament on your pavement please
[01:48:43] don't die for you good good old
[01:48:48] bro about to die with two healers no I'm
[01:48:50] not and I'm Auto battling so even if an
[01:48:52] optimal team runs someone like Pella
[01:48:54] papilla pela or like like another like
[01:48:57] silver wolf like a damage or like a
[01:48:59] Yukon like a good support if you're Auto
[01:49:01] battling it sometimes it's nice to have
[01:49:02] like a shielder or a Healer
[01:49:04] when I Auto Battle with blade I
[01:49:07] sometimes would use fire EMC even if
[01:49:08] you're not supposed to run a shield of
[01:49:09] them just touch that I don't have to
[01:49:11] look at my screen
[01:49:14] bro Cooks like Ryden
[01:49:19] oh wait it's not that yet
[01:49:25] let's just wait
[01:49:32] yes we did it Auto Battle
[01:49:35] all right cool we had so many cycles to
[01:49:38] spare
[01:49:39] all right America's 10 and we should
[01:49:42] probably be able to Auto I've never Auto
[01:49:43] battled 10 before so surely we can just
[01:49:44] Auto Battle this we're gonna fight
[01:49:46] yanking and uh the ascended who um
[01:49:49] sniffer
[01:49:53] all right
[01:49:55] who should I play first off
[01:49:57] um we could implant
[01:50:00] we can play Silly I mean uh my silly is
[01:50:04] my seal even geared
[01:50:07] kind of my suit is like very mid because
[01:50:09] yeah we don't talk about listen but I
[01:50:12] still is on two piece two beats she's
[01:50:13] usually not on four because I have a
[01:50:14] good I have good gloves
[01:50:16] oh what the [ __ ] wait ah
[01:50:25] usually I don't need a factory rate on
[01:50:27] silver wolf because I run her lycone
[01:50:28] however right now her light cone is on
[01:50:30] Pila so I need to run affected raid on
[01:50:33] her
[01:50:34] okay give me a second
[01:50:41] wow my ceiling is worse than I thought
[01:50:46] okay you know what
[01:50:50] let's play um I
[01:51:01] so that's why you keep implanting
[01:51:02] nothing home
[01:51:06] yeah right here
[01:51:11] all right let's do blade second
[01:51:14] and then I think we Brute Force
[01:51:17] first half with uh
[01:51:19] uh Dan Hong and we don't if we don't
[01:51:21] need to implants
[01:51:22] I mean we could
[01:51:24] we did that hung in Bible lunae silver
[01:51:27] wolf fushron
[01:51:29] Ting Yoon
[01:51:34] and then second off we do blade brania
[01:51:38] and then last saw it doesn't matter
[01:51:46] oh yeah if we Auto Battle our skill
[01:51:48] points are gonna get [ __ ]
[01:51:50] that is true actually because Auto
[01:51:52] Battle is going to use skill on silver
[01:51:54] wolf every time and skill on fuschwan
[01:51:56] every time
[01:51:57] yeah Auto Battle would not work here
[01:52:00] um
[01:52:07] gonna push on the blade then
[01:52:09] like blade
[01:52:11] brania silverfish on and then here we do
[01:52:15] this this
[01:52:21] pillow you guys think Pila will die be
[01:52:24] honest
[01:52:28] does team order matter kind of usually
[01:52:30] not really but if you have like a
[01:52:31] taunting character or like that
[01:52:33] sometimes you'll take AOE damage right
[01:52:34] you want them to be like on the edge
[01:52:36] like your tank to be on the edge like
[01:52:37] let's say like fire EMC taunts you don't
[01:52:39] want her to [ __ ] uh like get Splash
[01:52:42] damage to next routine
[01:52:49] okay surely I don't think Peel's gonna
[01:52:50] die surely people won't die surely Phil
[01:52:52] won't die we'll be able to Auto this
[01:52:55] Auto memory accounts 10. peel is not
[01:52:57] gonna die
[01:52:59] that's a tough nut to crack nut
[01:53:03] outside
[01:53:08] all right now we let audible do the
[01:53:10] trick
[01:53:15] should push one be next to Blade you
[01:53:16] could
[01:53:19] um I kind of worry about blade dying but
[01:53:23] yeah he has all the HP that should be
[01:53:25] fine yeah you could make him take more
[01:53:27] damage
[01:53:37] nice
[01:53:40] oh my God 166
[01:53:43] 000 damage in memory of chaos what sorry
[01:53:47] that hunger does what
[01:53:59] nice
[01:54:10] never as I was the last time you played
[01:54:12] genuine I play Genuine off stream today
[01:54:14] actually I play him every day yup we're
[01:54:16] cool like that me and genuine were cool
[01:54:20] hello Otto's terrible she keeps swimming
[01:54:22] E Yeah but at least she also whatever
[01:54:25] but yeah
[01:54:26] I stress reduction wow
[01:54:31] okay battle start two uh we are so
[01:54:33] [ __ ] our dead hung is about to die oh
[01:54:35] no
[01:54:45] okay maybe dude we're trying to Auto
[01:54:48] Battle which okay let me try and do
[01:54:50] automatically we'll do that hunt silver
[01:54:52] wolf push one right same team no no no
[01:54:54] wait that uh Ting Yoon
[01:54:57] same team but instead of pillow we use
[01:55:00] Natasha uh so that we can automatic
[01:55:02] better second second we do blade but
[01:55:04] brania
[01:55:06] fushan Mendes and then silver wolf
[01:55:10] but fine we can put an extra blade we
[01:55:12] can do like this this looks ugly though
[01:55:14] but
[01:55:24] let's wait
[01:55:28] we were running around
[01:55:31] two healers I can't dude we have way too
[01:55:33] much damage it doesn't matter we have
[01:55:34] like we literally have like 10 turns to
[01:55:36] spare every time
[01:55:53] imagine dying with the wheelchair
[01:56:18] or no yes if you don't pull for her you
[01:56:21] ruined your account everything's over
[01:56:23] you have to quit actually it's a must
[01:56:25] pull or your account is ruined actually
[01:56:27] yeah you actually just like your account
[01:56:29] on like next patch it just dies
[01:56:35] no I mean she's good but like it depends
[01:56:38] on who you have right
[01:56:50] okay that's fun
[01:57:02] I regret skipping the water I just have
[01:57:04] bailu and she annoys me why does she
[01:57:06] annoy you you don't like the who
[01:57:09] I like Balu yeah Buddy's annoying no
[01:57:12] [ __ ] cleanse
[01:57:20] also sometimes your skill just doesn't
[01:57:22] hit anything
[01:57:32] word cleansing track
[01:57:45] is the Dory of star rail okay Bailey's
[01:57:48] not bad she's just
[01:57:51] something
[01:58:03] she's definitely a character
[01:58:10] it's not you
[01:58:16] yeah received divinity
[01:58:23] word cleansing Dragon
[01:58:29] oh dude
[01:58:41] okay maybe we don't Auto Battle
[01:58:43] maybe maybe maybe maybe we maybe we
[01:58:46] don't on a battle maybe we uh [ __ ] dude
[01:58:50] how is that my fault though
[01:58:52] how is that my fault though
[01:59:09] two healers and lost La Mao
[01:59:15] [ __ ] you
[01:59:17] that was Auto Battle that was literally
[01:59:19] Auto Battle and that was not my fault it
[01:59:21] was Auto Battle
[01:59:25] look now we'll play it and if I lose
[01:59:28] then then there's no one to blame by me
[01:59:32] but I don't know if I'm
[01:59:35] oops where's dojo
[01:59:53] actually we could probably
[01:59:55] surely we could peel a second right
[02:00:00] did I feel like Peel's gonna die
[02:00:01] wherever I put her
[02:00:22] okay I'm surely people don't die
[02:00:38] all right now we have the absolute God
[02:00:42] gamer controlling the [ __ ] characters
[02:00:44] so we're not gonna lose now we're
[02:00:46] controlling the team ourselves
[02:00:51] yup uh-huh yep all according to plan
[02:00:56] I should have broken this one but it
[02:00:57] doesn't matter
[02:00:59] yep that was the wrong implant but all
[02:01:02] good
[02:01:14] ow
[02:01:17] already failing okay you're about to
[02:01:20] look dumb when we win because we are not
[02:01:22] failing
[02:01:27] I probably should hit the Trotter all
[02:01:28] good
[02:01:30] yeah I definitely should have hit the
[02:01:31] Trotter
[02:01:32] all good
[02:01:42] search
[02:01:47] do I actually need to hit the Trotter uh
[02:01:50] sure
[02:02:01] this is double speed
[02:02:04] it's probably a waste
[02:02:07] a thousand wonders Ain't No Way
[02:02:10] targeting Trotter dude I haven't done
[02:02:11] Mary house 10 in a while I usually just
[02:02:13] don't pay attention I wasn't sure if
[02:02:14] Trotter was the player or not clearly it
[02:02:16] wasn't
[02:02:21] okay that's fine that's fine
[02:02:26] okay should I use my skill nope never

[02:05:54] that's the only problem
[02:05:57] the ones that I do are on other
[02:05:58] characters
[02:06:09] um I need to Fleet of the ages err
[02:06:11] or I don't need hit rate on the light
[02:06:13] cone if I
[02:06:15] use this one
[02:06:21] Sean Mendes
[02:06:28] well I might not have an ER one do I not
[02:06:30] sure they have one
[02:06:36] wow I actually don't
[02:06:41] four star one
[02:06:46] this is not gonna be enough though
[02:06:51] Gamba um
[02:06:54] it's fine
[02:07:02] check the points why I mean okay we I
[02:07:06] can clear I mostly [ __ ] blindfolded I
[02:07:07] just want to try to use the new
[02:07:08] characters well I want to try to use
[02:07:10] these two teams I don't use because if
[02:07:12] I'm smart I use uh I changed my first
[02:07:14] half team to not be that hung but I kind
[02:07:16] of want to play this team
[02:07:29] maybe we play
[02:07:34] [ __ ] it okay I just had it again
[02:07:53] we're doing this no matter what
[02:07:55] I just don't know who our last character
[02:07:57] is
[02:07:58] because there's no point in giving us
[02:07:59] more damage because our damage is so
[02:08:01] high but I mean I guess you can weakness
[02:08:02] break we could also just implant if we
[02:08:05] go silver wolf
[02:08:07] and then swap these two
[02:08:21] same with the second team
[02:08:36] honestly if we're smart we probably do
[02:08:39] this again but I think I think we don't
[02:08:42] need to
[02:08:49] surely right
[02:08:52] although I feel like this guy does more
[02:08:53] damage than the other half
[02:08:55] so we can maybe foosh on first half
[02:08:58] because she's this guy's more annoying
[02:09:00] so we could swap these two
[02:09:09] and then just do this
[02:09:21] I still don't want to play pillow though
[02:09:23] Pila is so [ __ ] dead
[02:09:34] ah dude peel us so [ __ ] dead if we do
[02:09:36] that we could we could just be dumb and
[02:09:38] do this
[02:09:46] and there are second teams cracked and
[02:09:48] our first team just won't die
[02:09:54] surely fuschwan's enough I believe in
[02:09:56] her [ __ ] it
[02:09:58] oops wrong order
[02:10:01] I [ __ ] I believe in her
[02:10:04] peel your geared right
[02:10:06] uh not the right lycon but all good
[02:10:13] God I believe in her
[02:10:19] I believe in her
[02:10:26] all right here we go
[02:10:30] We're not gonna lose this one
[02:10:36] I'm afraid I have never lost a single
[02:10:38] time wow I'm at these e okay well
[02:10:41] I'll talk about it
[02:10:43] but as I was saying I have never lost a
[02:10:45] single time okay well now I'm gonna
[02:10:47] skill on [ __ ] pillow which is stupid
[02:10:53] I'll explain the last two runs no
[02:11:04] [ __ ] you
[02:11:07] creation
[02:11:18] okay this is fine
[02:11:22] she heals herself yup yup yup yup yup
[02:11:25] okay wait
[02:11:27] uh we do this
[02:11:40] okay that's good
[02:11:45] do I need the Buffs for my ALT if I alt
[02:11:47] second
[02:11:49] uh yeah sure cause now we keep the box
[02:11:51] for it
[02:11:57] from customers
[02:11:59] welcome customers
[02:12:03] Auto Battle would have played better
[02:12:05] [ __ ] no it wouldn't have
[02:12:07] you literally know you're lying
[02:12:18] foreign
[02:13:10] that was a lot of [ __ ] damage and now
[02:13:12] we go again I'm gonna kill this guy
[02:13:14] first because he [ __ ] one shots on my
[02:13:15] dudes
[02:13:18] please don't die please please if you
[02:13:20] one shot my
[02:13:22] no he can't well first one we actually
[02:13:23] can't which one's too good here
[02:13:25] we're too tanky
[02:13:29] yep
[02:13:33] ready for another yup
[02:13:35] oh she's about to [ __ ] slice her
[02:13:38] right because this targets him whatever
[02:13:39] who cares that's fine we don't die yup
[02:13:42] okay pushon's actually broken here
[02:13:44] yeah he's actually broken here
[02:13:46] especially if you're playing characters
[02:13:47] with one [ __ ] HP like pillar tignan
[02:13:49] okay what if I
[02:13:54] do this
[02:14:01] it's time
[02:14:06] cease the moment
[02:14:17] s
[02:14:23] oh my God 137
[02:14:26] 000. actually good damage
[02:14:30] no it's just one enemy left but it's
[02:14:32] fine should I use my skill here
[02:14:38] no
[02:14:41] foreign
[02:15:03] ER
[02:15:06] nice
[02:15:10] all right that's easy solo is the prime
[02:15:12] I feel bad for all doubters that are
[02:15:14] about to lose all the channel points
[02:15:15] because there's no way in [ __ ] this team
[02:15:16] is dying we have launcher yeah
[02:15:20] let me just uh let me quickly just gauge
[02:15:22] the prediction uh just see how many
[02:15:24] people are about to lose their Channel
[02:15:25] points wow oh it's actually not that
[02:15:27] many but 372 000 travel points are gone
[02:15:29] that is crazy how you guys are all gonna
[02:15:31] lose
[02:15:31] that is crazy
[02:15:33] that is crazy
[02:15:46] I want to get this without Auto
[02:15:48] targeting you think it hits nice
[02:15:53] repay
[02:15:57] don't get complacent
[02:16:00] wait who should I try the Trotter [ __ ]
[02:16:02] it
[02:16:04] uh I kind of use my skill here I could
[02:16:07] afford a skill point
[02:16:10] yeah let's go I kind of want to hit the
[02:16:11] Trotter but I should probably implant no
[02:16:13] but I don't use that plant but it
[02:16:14] reduces rest
[02:16:21] ah [ __ ] it
[02:16:27] oh dude
[02:16:29] jeez man leave my silver wolf alone
[02:16:33] holy [ __ ]

[02:16:50] branias that paradise may be unreachable
[02:16:52] savor it for me
[02:16:54] okay blade I mean if you want to savor
[02:16:56] it together just hit me up 1-800-554
[02:17:01] are we about to get [ __ ]
[02:17:03] oh no we can result
[02:17:11] this is double speed
[02:17:14] he's hitting our launch oh we implanted
[02:17:16] it nice
[02:17:17] yeah I mean we're guaranteed to find
[02:17:18] Quantum better so I don't know why I
[02:17:20] acted surprised but XD uh we're gonna
[02:17:23] hit the middle dude
[02:17:24] boom
[02:17:25] then we're gonna bronya never mind
[02:17:27] Blade's gonna [ __ ] them up
[02:17:30] simply so good
[02:17:37] I mean so dude actually carried the eyes
[02:17:39] I mean [ __ ] you Piggy
[02:17:51] yeah
[02:17:53] I'll see you off well I'm dying in the
[02:17:56] Auto Battle

[02:18:14] right target okay

[02:18:18] I think sheltered him yeah well okay
[02:18:19] that's good
[02:18:23] all right we win
[02:18:28] oh yeah
[02:18:34] you chose The Wrong Enemy
[02:18:38] okay uh we're gonna hit this
[02:18:42] then we're gonna silver wolf uh right
[02:18:46] here
[02:18:48] then we're gonna blade in the middle I
[02:18:51] play the fiddle okay good then we
[02:18:57] now we Alt because we're buffed all to
[02:19:00] the middle again

[02:19:06] [ __ ] you yeah Jake sorry I like
[02:19:09] handshake actually I can't change
[02:19:12] I chose it from the center Banner
[02:19:14] not bench by the way not bench I didn't
[02:19:16] mention uh I kind of want to heal
[02:19:18] because I'm afraid of what's about to
[02:19:19] happen
[02:19:20] but it's probably not smart to heal
[02:19:25] I shouldn't heal it's dumb if I heal but
[02:19:27] I want to because I'm afraid I'm gonna
[02:19:30] heal just because I'm afraid but I know
[02:19:31] I probably shouldn't
[02:19:38] surely brownie doesn't die
[02:19:40] it's fine
[02:19:41] yep
[02:19:47] stop being scared dude we have so much
[02:19:49] damage we might as well play it safe if
[02:19:51] I die you're all gonna laugh at me oh so
[02:19:53] bad oh should have healed oh [ __ ]
[02:19:55] hindsight Harry's in the chat I might as
[02:19:56] well heal and be safe
[02:19:58] you'll pay for this
[02:20:07] that paradise savor it for me
[02:20:13] nice good damage
[02:20:19] it's fine
[02:20:20] probably should use skill on silver wolf
[02:20:22] there but it doesn't really matter
[02:20:25] more
[02:20:27] enemies all right we win
[02:20:39] and just like that the memory
[02:20:43] too little
[02:20:45] [Music]
[02:20:48] can I have fun
[02:20:52] and just like that the memory of chaos
[02:20:55] was vanquished thanks to the one and
[02:20:58] only while a lot of characters but me
[02:21:02] I go pretty easy we've had [ __ ] 22
[02:21:05] Cycles left
[02:21:06] pretty easy
[02:21:08] one carried our first half especially as
[02:21:10] a ninja part however we like [ __ ]
[02:21:12] needed her there to not die I mean I've
[02:21:13] cleared okay disclaimer I've cleared
[02:21:15] moc-10 without push one but she made it
[02:21:17] a lot easier and then in Bible today
[02:21:19] [ __ ] them in that sideways they
[02:21:21] literally bent them over and then
[02:21:23] oh it's all coming out now uh and then
[02:21:27] second half was just yeah it was just
[02:21:28] easy Blade the ultra yeah
[02:21:32] the blade brought you the water can
[02:21:33] literally beat anything

[02:23:04] wow
[02:23:06] but I have to pee first so let's Auto

[02:23:10] to drink a lot because I'm sick so I'm
[02:23:11] gonna have to
[02:23:12] pee a lot of the stream uh let's Auto
[02:23:15] Battle maybe what's a good thing
[02:23:18] what do we need
[02:23:21] this this is a good good one good domain
[02:23:30] Farm Quantum dungeon yeah my silly would
[02:23:33] be happy with that
[02:23:43] all right let's talk about this let me
[02:23:45] hear me
[02:23:48] repeat
[02:24:04] what is it we're waiting for
[02:24:57] foreign
[02:25:31] you know
[02:25:45] dude there's no [ __ ] lead in auto
[02:25:52] okay whatever ah [ __ ] you guys you guys
[02:25:55] are gonna watch it on about them now
[02:25:56] dude how did I not Auto Battle
[02:25:59] whatever
[02:26:00] dude
[02:26:02] I okay whatever Iris fever I thought it
[02:26:05] was
[02:26:07] because they did mlc usually it's Auto
[02:26:08] auto
[02:26:17] all right
[02:26:19] why did the Jeff give me a tweet of
[02:26:22] someone saying every character is a
[02:26:23] complete kit at c0 you are simply wrong
[02:26:25] two passive talents skill burst normal
[02:26:28] attacks heart attack if a character
[02:26:29] doesn't feel good don't pull for them
[02:26:31] question mark That's not a game design
[02:26:32] fault you're just weird true
[02:26:37] received to finish true
[02:26:49] [Music]
[02:26:54] hey this monkey yeah he's annoying this
[02:26:56] [ __ ] gorillas sucks
[02:27:23] wow we got uh I mean
[02:27:28] this could be good I guess yeah
[02:27:40] why the [ __ ] do I have this to do stuff
[02:27:42] well we don't talk about it all right
[02:27:44] civilian River time
[02:27:51] foreign
[02:28:09] I don't want I feel like I should put
[02:28:11] her on the edge and blade next to her
[02:28:12] but this looks ugly as [ __ ] so I don't
[02:28:14] like doing that so we'll put fushwana's
[02:28:16] like
[02:28:17] we'll put her on the opposite end I
[02:28:18] guess
[02:28:19] no but that's dumb they have to be next
[02:28:22] to each other I just think it looks
[02:28:24] stupid if my DPS is another one
[02:28:27] I guess it doesn't matter though
[02:28:28] whatever
[02:28:53] all right swarm disaster time whoa I
[02:28:57] love swarm disaster whoa bat chest I
[02:28:59] didn't do difficulty one
[02:29:01] Chad should we do difficulty one I got
[02:29:03] 120 Jades
[02:29:05] three five
[02:29:08] wait can we Photoshop this to pretend I
[02:29:10] didn't do five already because I
[02:29:11] actually didn't it was like an auto
[02:29:12] battle mistake I
[02:29:14] I didn't mean to
[02:29:15] I was dude it's so fun I actually love
[02:29:17] this [ __ ] game mode it's very fun
[02:29:32] cleared it I did it
[02:29:36] how do you beat everybody without a
[02:29:38] battle okay I would Autobell the normal
[02:29:40] fights but then for like the boss I
[02:29:41] would put like not Auto Battle it's not
[02:29:42] like I just full auto battles but I was
[02:29:44] playing it on the train because I was
[02:29:45] bored as [ __ ] and I was like this is fun
[02:29:46] I did one run on the train and I swear
[02:29:49] it was the one run that beat it I am not
[02:29:51] even I was thinking of abandoning it or
[02:29:52] waiting but I was like I'm not just
[02:29:53] gonna leave and I just got lucky
[02:30:01] I am not even kidding
[02:30:04] I played uh invivor
[02:30:06] but I want to clearly like every pass
[02:30:08] doesn't matter okay okay
[02:30:13] we're gonna do
[02:30:14] we're gonna full clear swarm five
[02:30:17] full clear which I haven't streamed yet
[02:30:22] with our newly found uh fuschwan
[02:30:28] and that hung invitor and then we're
[02:30:30] gonna [ __ ] it up we're gonna do
[02:30:31] destruction path probably because we're
[02:30:32] Giga chats alpha males uh uh uh a
[02:30:35] strong-willed individuals
[02:30:38] but I also want to clear it with a bunch
[02:30:40] of um
[02:30:41] a bunch of different paths I think
[02:30:43] remembrance is cringe but it's very easy
[02:30:44] like very good I want to do Harmony
[02:30:46] because it's fun and I'll do the Hillary
[02:30:48] because it's fun
[02:30:51] actually a button it isn't fun but it's
[02:30:53] good
[02:30:55] I haven't done a hunt though maybe Hunt
[02:30:57] is doable I feel like Hunters do get
[02:30:59] [ __ ] I don't know we also don't have
[02:31:01] that many unlocks we have like some
[02:31:04] um but I feel like it's we're cheating
[02:31:06] if we have all the paths to get me
[02:31:08] like we have some some of these unlocked
[02:31:10] not not like that many
[02:31:15] ah
[02:31:19] path of Harmony true okay I you know
[02:31:21] what I mean I didn't mean to say Harmony
[02:31:22] I'm gonna say I'm about to say abundance
[02:31:25] I meant to say abundance not Harmony I
[02:31:27] meant to say abundance
[02:31:29] I meant to say abundance
[02:31:39] dude there could be a path of Harmony
[02:31:40] why is it a path of Harmony
[02:31:47] okay however we need to change our build
[02:31:49] a little stay in the middle solving the
[02:31:53] riddle because I think we're gonna play
[02:31:54] bronia because my opinion's gonna get
[02:31:55] [ __ ] sideways so I would not like that
[02:31:58] I don't want her neck to snap again so
[02:32:00] what we're going to do is play branya
[02:32:02] um the only thing with brania is she
[02:32:03] needs to have she wants more than 104
[02:32:05] speed it's just I play with blade who's
[02:32:06] on 105 speed so we're gonna do is we're
[02:32:08] gonna give her uh we're gonna change her
[02:32:10] build to what it normally is which is
[02:32:13] um
[02:32:19] ah
[02:32:21] where is my normal build it's um
[02:32:31] oh yeah I use a I use uh wait no I threw
[02:32:35] it away I used a four star one because I
[02:32:37] don't have [ __ ] crit damage on any
[02:32:38] messenger glove so I don't have a dude
[02:32:40] none of my messenger gloves has crit
[02:32:42] damage as a stat none of them look not
[02:32:44] one of them has crit damage
[02:32:47] [ __ ] it we don't need four piece
[02:33:05] okay what if we do a quick what if we do
[02:33:07] it quick what if we what if we what if
[02:33:08] we watch watch you guys might be like

[02:33:16] watch this watch this watch this
[02:33:23] boom [ __ ]
[02:33:30] [ __ ]
[02:33:32] maybe what if we yeah what if we level
[02:33:33] it
[02:33:35] maybe we get it to plus three
[02:33:51] plus three ball strap good damage oh

[02:35:15] are you ready watch us I bet a hundred
[02:35:19] gifted Subs that this piece will be
[02:35:20] better than the one we're throwing in I
[02:35:22] bet a hundred is gonna be better a
[02:35:24] hundred
[02:35:26] [ __ ] okay no no no no one cryptomatrol
[02:35:30] is better one Crystal one is better I am
[02:35:32] not joking if it gets one credential is
[02:35:34] better one one even if factorized
[02:35:36] honestly anything but five HP is better
[02:35:38] no no it's actually better it's actually
[02:35:39] better wait wait wait wait wait wait
[02:35:40] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[02:35:41] wait wait wait wait I'm not paying up
[02:35:42] let me cook I'm not gonna just pay up
[02:35:44] without even rolling to the full extent
[02:35:46] of the law let me keep rolling let me
[02:35:48] keep rolling let me keep rolling and
[02:35:50] then we'll talk let me keep rolling and
[02:35:52] then we'll talk
[02:35:55] shut up I don't want to hear the Domino
[02:36:01] wait why didn't I hear the
[02:36:02] text-to-speech anyways
[02:36:04] watch watch are you watching
[02:36:08] are you watching
[02:36:10] are you are you watching
[02:36:20] [ __ ] what can I throw away man
[02:36:28] 100 gifted and 100 I'm not gifting a
[02:36:31] hundred
[02:36:34] I need something to throw dude all right
[02:36:36] I'm sorry I love you man but we have to
[02:36:39] throw this I need to level something
[02:36:43] watch
[02:36:53] wait what the [ __ ] is this
[02:37:01] should I throw five star pieces in it
[02:37:02] feels like a waste
[02:37:04] [ __ ] it
[02:37:07] don't Pepe W me I'm not a whale but I
[02:37:09] have to do what I have to do
[02:37:13] I have to man I have to I have to
[02:37:15] it is what it is
[02:37:21] watch
[02:37:30] watch if this gets one wait
[02:37:34] if this gets one more credential it's
[02:37:36] better
[02:37:41] oh that's technically technically that
[02:37:44] could be better because effectres on
[02:37:45] bronya technically technically effectres
[02:37:49] onbronya is a good stat and now we're
[02:37:51] gonna get crit dammit
[02:37:53] that is good so on this set so this set
[02:37:56] is used by support characters who and a
[02:37:58] factor as an HP is really good on the
[02:38:00] set example can use this set and can use
[02:38:03] all of the stats we got here matter of
[02:38:05] fact we don't even want crit damage on
[02:38:06] her if we're playing a purely supportive
[02:38:08] build so these stats are actually great
[02:38:10] uh uh they're great for some support
[02:38:12] characters uh so it is better than the
[02:38:15] last piece uh true and real
[02:38:18] true so I don't owe you guys anything
[02:38:19] true true
[02:38:28] oh
[02:38:29] I win you lose
[02:38:31] uh okay I feel like okay I didn't scam
[02:38:34] you guys but just to clear my conscious
[02:38:36] I'm gonna give you guys 10 Subs 10. okay
[02:38:39] 10 Subs unlike minus 15 10. but I it is
[02:38:43] technically technically maybe better
[02:38:52] oh
[02:38:53] whoa like the 10 gifted
[02:38:58] it's huge transox
[02:39:05] wow these boots are so [ __ ] bad
[02:39:09] oh
[02:39:11] at least I have effect dress
[02:39:13] how to make crit damage get lower dude
[02:39:33] try you guys think this is Gonna Roll
[02:39:34] Chris image again
[02:39:36] I can't even level it
[02:39:45] wait I should get this out of there
[02:39:48] no
[02:39:50] well
[02:39:52] one day we'll get it
[02:40:01] can you stop gearing dude I don't want
[02:40:03] to enter the [ __ ] swarm and get
[02:40:05] [ __ ] and then and then I can't explain
[02:40:06] why
[02:40:07] okay we'll go now let's go
[02:40:14] you do your dailies every day on Star
[02:40:16] rail yes on genchin when I stream when I
[02:40:18] don't stream I try to but I don't have
[02:40:19] the time end up not doing it because I
[02:40:21] like pass out or something
[02:40:23] but I tried to I sped resin every day
[02:40:25] though and stamina
[02:40:30] am I dying
[02:40:42] okay we're gonna do imbibitor
[02:40:45] bronia
[02:40:47] and then if we want an optimal damage
[02:40:50] dealing team we go silver wolf but I
[02:40:52] genuinely don't think
[02:40:54] I think the whole difficulty of storm 5
[02:40:56] is like we wanna be we don't want to die
[02:40:58] until we get good cards so I think at
[02:41:01] the start we do the ultra and then we
[02:41:03] just have like a tanky team
[02:41:05] and then eventually we could add maybe
[02:41:07] we could download silver wolf
[02:41:09] Zai zero x heart
[02:41:15] no nocha
[02:41:17] damn
[02:41:22] I guess we could play at risky
[02:41:25] we could play risky if you guys want
[02:41:37] trust and for Sean yeah I mean we could
[02:41:39] always download Lucha later if we need
[02:41:41] them four plus three that's seven I need
[02:41:44] one more
[02:41:46] ah
[02:41:50] what do I feel like leveling
[02:41:52] probably skill
[02:42:02] I kind of want to level alt though
[02:42:04] because it's funny number but I know
[02:42:06] it's not as good
[02:42:07] I mean I do Tylenol skill any mini miny
[02:42:11] moe
[02:42:12] catch the tiger by the toe
[02:42:15] let him go
[02:42:21] I can't wanna do alt because it's funny
[02:42:22] but I probably shouldn't yeah I probably
[02:42:24] shouldn't whatever all right let's go
[02:42:26] so these are the characters we're going
[02:42:27] in with actually I'll download the ultra
[02:42:29] mid-mid run for now I'll just use the
[02:42:30] roof characters are going to Boom
[02:42:34] uh boom ignore two-piece but our Chris
[02:42:36] that's really good so who cares then
[02:42:38] bronya with one less speed ideally it's
[02:42:39] one three four but it doesn't matter
[02:42:40] boom and we have her lycone and then
[02:42:43] we're on this
[02:42:45] fuschwan is on this our defense is kind
[02:42:47] of low but it is what it is I think
[02:42:48] we're fine
[02:42:49] uh and then our silver wolf is uh speedy
[02:42:53] kind of low HP though but oh I can give
[02:42:56] her her lyco now
[02:42:59] the first for Moc yeah but I don't want
[02:43:01] to change builds for every piece of
[02:43:02] content does that make sense like
[02:43:12] but we could just do this I guess I mean
[02:43:14] yeah sure
[02:43:16] we don't need more hit rate
[02:43:27] all right are we ready I think we're
[02:43:29] ready
[02:43:36] let's go
[02:43:37] why are you guys gambling on this we are
[02:43:39] trying I we dude the thing with swarm 5
[02:43:42] is sometimes you have to reset a lot
[02:43:43] this is gonna be our first try on stream
[02:43:45] this is our first storm five try on
[02:43:47] stream and I think we can get carried by
[02:43:49] Fusion
[02:43:50] but
[02:43:54] we might need to reset it for unlucky
[02:43:55] like there is some luck involved
[02:44:01] and skill which I have so if we lose
[02:44:03] it's never a skill issue because I have
[02:44:05] never misplayed also I'm allowed to alt
[02:44:07] f4 I am I don't care I'm allowed listen
[02:44:10] listen if it's winnable and I misplay
[02:44:12] I'm allowed shut up [ __ ] you I am I'm
[02:44:14] saying this before the game is over
[02:44:25] okay
[02:44:26] if I alt f4 we could give the the points
[02:44:29] to doubters
[02:44:30] but I still I'm gonna do it
[02:44:34] all right whatever
[02:44:35] so we want to maximize Elites if we go
[02:44:37] destruction Elites we would go
[02:44:40] boom boom boom and then boom
[02:44:42] good take
[02:44:46] deduct two points of the countdown and
[02:44:47] obtain three random blessings
[02:44:49] we don't get a curio
[02:44:51] [Music]
[02:44:55] oh
[02:44:57] [ __ ] I like to gamble with curios no I'm
[02:44:59] sad
[02:45:02] I guess we could Cosmic fragments reset
[02:45:05] heroes are garbage nah dude you gotta
[02:45:07] You Gotta Get Lucky just get lucky
[02:45:10] kuros could be garbage
[02:45:18] all right that's a that's a reset shot
[02:45:21] that's actually a reset
[02:45:24] can I reset without rooting the gambo
[02:45:26] chat please
[02:45:27] please
[02:45:33] wait if you reset you get to choose you
[02:45:36] still get to choose right it doesn't
[02:45:37] [ __ ] you I know you get nothing if you
[02:45:39] reset in normal civilian universe but in
[02:45:41] swarm you can choose right no I thought
[02:45:44] you could
[02:45:45] because I already said after like one
[02:45:46] room and it worked maybe it was a bit
[02:45:48] longer I don't know no you can't okay
[02:45:50] but you know nothing
[02:45:51] what if you're lying to me what if
[02:45:53] you're lying to me
[02:45:57] let me group them up
[02:46:01] let me group them up
[02:46:04] then why ask sorry I got my trap
[02:46:11] all right surely we got a good start if
[02:46:13] you get a bad start in swarm five you're
[02:46:14] probably [ __ ] five but we'll be okay
[02:46:34] please Kareem if I'm dying so I can pay
[02:46:37] attention
[02:46:39] okay uh oh wow
[02:46:42] all right well we're gonna go for
[02:46:44] construct concentration because
[02:46:45] destruction with preservation is the key
[02:46:47] preservation destruction together very
[02:46:49] very good that is how I won
[02:46:52] oh this one kind of sucks I might reset
[02:46:56] that's it
[02:47:01] it's fun
[02:47:05] skip
[02:47:06] no no
[02:47:10] um we could do this is fine and that's
[02:47:13] the divorce that's pretty cool so that
[02:47:14] that's unlucky though we got no
[02:47:16] destruction and no preservation all good
[02:47:23] nice do we do that
[02:47:26] immediately get a blessing give me are
[02:47:28] we doing a lead for Destruction
[02:47:36] don't take spread it now spread average
[02:47:37] is good
[02:47:38] maybe not for Fusion but with the world
[02:47:40] show it's really good
[02:47:43] this is not bad but we kind of need
[02:47:46] distraction blessings right now should I
[02:47:47] spare it
[02:47:52] [Music]
[02:47:57] did I ask it I want to risk it
[02:48:03] fine uh fine we'll get it
[02:48:12] so throw this version yeah but if we get
[02:48:13] it we can just bench for trying to put
[02:48:15] the Rocha good take
[02:48:17] because it is like on its own it's kind
[02:48:19] of broken
[02:48:24] what the huh
[02:48:26] he just [ __ ] died wasn't that an
[02:48:28] elite
[02:48:29] okay well
[02:48:33] oh my God
[02:48:37] these are so bad
[02:48:42] laughs
[02:48:54] okay it's got a blessing immediately
[02:48:59] this is not good but at least it's a
[02:49:01] destruction no attack he's killed I was
[02:49:02] thinking of Blade yeah this is fine we
[02:49:03] can attack it's fine
[02:49:06] okay
[02:49:12] why is someone spamming a question I'm
[02:49:14] not even gonna answer it why are you
[02:49:15] okay that's a 12-hour timeout
[02:49:19] hey guys can you put one hour of Silence
[02:49:22] broken up by lamented that's not a thing
[02:49:26] is it cleansing track
[02:49:40] upon a drink no that sucks uh one time
[02:49:44] per battle that also sucks both of these
[02:49:45] suck but if I reset I don't get a
[02:49:47] destruction blessing I will scream
[02:49:50] so we're gonna do this one
[02:49:53] should bomb people for more it's fine I
[02:49:55] just if if mods don't Bonk I'm harsher
[02:50:04] I'm gonna go middle and then we go up
[02:50:06] here and then we go back to Middle stay
[02:50:08] in the middle and then we lose a
[02:50:10] countdown turn but at least we get a
[02:50:11] swarm I think it's worse that's really
[02:50:12] good actually
[02:50:14] that's [ __ ] up too much crit rate
[02:50:17] foreign
[02:50:30] okay no way we're gambling you know what
[02:50:33] [ __ ] it we gamble do we gamble yeah I
[02:50:36] mean
[02:50:37] can we Gamba minus 40.
[02:51:01] dude if we get the one where we no dude
[02:51:04] this could actually make us lose
[02:51:09] why are believers saying Gamba
[02:51:25] laughs
[02:51:29] [ __ ] it for Content oh that's so good
[02:51:32] that's so good that's so good we get out
[02:51:33] get out get the [ __ ] out get the [ __ ]
[02:51:34] out nope nope nope [ __ ] you nope we're
[02:51:36] out we're in we're out we win we got out
[02:51:40] okay whatever uh this sucks who cares
[02:51:43] okay I want to do the lead but I think
[02:51:45] it's worth giving the countdown minus
[02:51:46] one to do a swarm because swarm is
[02:51:47] really good for us so we're gonna do
[02:51:49] we're gonna zigzag
[02:51:51] I think people are too afraid of the
[02:51:52] countdown I'm not I'm not afraid of the
[02:51:54] [ __ ] countdown
[02:51:55] uh I will say we get a lot of free
[02:51:57] credit right now on our imbibator so I
[02:51:59] think criterate's bad for us so we could
[02:52:01] change our relics to have a quick damage
[02:52:02] body I just don't have a quick damage
[02:52:04] body
[02:52:04] so uh
[02:52:20] I don't have a wheelchair oh [ __ ] wait
[02:52:23] how do I win this attack push one right
[02:52:26] because Lewis's technique is like broken
[02:52:28] here
[02:52:31] all things in this world oh this just
[02:52:33] breaks everything come on
[02:52:40] sorry that's just how silver roll talks
[02:52:42] I'm sorry no disrespect though no way
[02:52:44] you're gearing mid-run bro if we get a
[02:52:46] million Crim raid for free why would we
[02:52:48] stay on our crit rate body
[02:52:50] it's been awake
[02:53:01] always a weakness oh I forgot it was
[02:53:03] bronya next [ __ ] I should have done that
[02:53:05] I should have basic oh
[02:53:13] no it doesn't matter actually it doesn't
[02:53:15] it literally doesn't matter
[02:53:17] why is this on One XP
[02:53:19] I thought I thought it just felt so yeah
[02:53:20] we won easy
[02:53:26] goodness
[02:53:36] Don't Mind If I Do
[02:53:39] Don't Mind If I Do
[02:53:44] that sucks but whatever
[02:53:47] this is [ __ ] terrible just give it up
[02:53:51] we'll go do the elite
[02:53:59] uh uh we'll do
[02:54:03] this
[02:54:10] it's fine
[02:54:11] that's fine
[02:54:22] do I need the skill on her oh yeah I
[02:54:25] probably should
[02:54:28] okay I'll do this we'll do this then
[02:54:30] skill here
[02:54:32] then basic one
[02:54:34] and we eat no we can do a three
[02:54:42] search
[02:55:00] do I should say that for the boss coming
[02:55:02] up next but it's fine this guy's still
[02:55:05] like full HP

[02:56:11] it this is a skill point which is
[02:56:13] actually
[02:56:15] it would be better for like more healing
[02:56:17] like Lucha but whatever
[02:56:21] no I [ __ ] pressed
[02:56:31] wait I actually this doesn't work for
[02:56:32] the boss right [ __ ]

[02:57:20] for gamers

[02:59:14] oh the Discord mod
[02:59:18] I see
[02:59:21] this one
[02:59:28] caution I have like no technique points
[02:59:31] I will do this
[02:59:36] all right
[02:59:39] all things in this world
[02:59:53] trickier to crack trickier to crack
[03:00:03] can we do this we should have enough
[03:00:05] skill points to do this and then brania
[03:00:08] and then three and then alt and then we
[03:00:11] break his shield true
[03:00:13] oh 195k okay hello let me win
[03:00:19] wait we didn't break a shield whatever
[03:00:20] we're close enough
[03:00:23] so I didn't push around thank that for
[03:00:24] us yep
[03:00:30] that's unfortunate fun
[03:00:36] time to change
[03:00:40] I forgot brownie was I'm playing Ronnie
[03:00:41] with [ __ ] imbiverter
[03:00:44] oops
[03:00:45] I'll just throw attack
[03:00:47] so let me go again right after
[03:00:50] still don't have enough skill points
[03:00:52] though
[03:00:56] [Music]
[03:01:05] if we do this we line up correctly so
[03:01:07] we're gonna do this
[03:01:08] it actually gets Advanced forward so it
[03:01:10] should be fine
[03:01:11] uh I'm gonna do that
[03:01:18] no dude
[03:01:20] two
[03:01:22] there's one
[03:01:25] [ __ ] I was doing
[03:01:31] your stream is fun take that back
[03:01:35] don't say that around here
[03:01:40] we don't have fun around these parts
[03:01:43] what do you think this is
[03:01:48] good damage
[03:01:53] okay now we
[03:01:55] um
[03:01:56] if I implant I could stunt him before he
[03:01:57] attacks us but we lose the skill point
[03:01:59] but I think it's worth it
[03:02:01] of course without the wind XD
[03:02:05] fine
[03:02:07] for us gigashad
[03:02:14] all right we went here
[03:02:20] store Evans
[03:02:24] 351 000. I gotta stop doing this if this
[03:02:27] is made into a video and I say that it
[03:02:28] looks weird Okay so regression
[03:02:31] inequality of annihilation is one of the
[03:02:33] most broken destruction things ever by
[03:02:35] far it's not even close but apparently
[03:02:36] with fuschwan it's [ __ ] ass because
[03:02:38] she wants to tank things so I'm not
[03:02:39] gonna take it but I really wish I could
[03:02:41] take it we could we could also just take
[03:02:44] it and then like download this guy and
[03:02:46] then just play The Witcher instead of
[03:02:47] her
[03:02:49] ah but I don't want to I think we just
[03:02:52] reset
[03:02:54] I mean it's minus 50 if we upgrade it
[03:02:57] it's 15 less damage
[03:03:03] and I don't want to venture like we just
[03:03:04] pulled for her today
[03:03:10] yeah I don't think we take it
[03:03:27] if I upgraded is it still good with her
[03:03:30] because the 15 is is surely it's fine
[03:03:33] right
[03:03:37] ah
[03:03:45] not really
[03:03:50] is a calyx after damage split yeah I
[03:03:53] know it's like usually it's amazing but
[03:03:55] with fuschwan I've heard people say it's
[03:03:57] bad
[03:03:58] so but I don't know I feel like it could
[03:04:00] still be fine
[03:04:16] the downwardly split before Photon takes
[03:04:18] damage
[03:04:20] oh
[03:04:23] I mean yeah I guess that makes that okay
[03:04:25] fine
[03:04:33] critical
[03:04:39] this is actually good this is good this
[03:04:41] is good I actually forgot what this does
[03:04:43] this is good this is good because when
[03:04:45] we uh actually good actually good free
[03:04:47] turn actually good actually good the
[03:04:49] only problem is we have way too much
[03:04:52] crit rate way too much
[03:05:03] oh wait how many [ __ ] fragments are
[03:05:06] oh
[03:05:09] here's robe I really like
[03:05:11] do you want soup uh yeah but my dad made
[03:05:14] steaks I probably shouldn't order soup
[03:05:15] or make soup
[03:05:17] fifty percent of five seven one that's
[03:05:19] like
[03:05:20] 250 plus 30 280 ish well 35 so 85.
[03:05:27] but
[03:05:29] this is pretty good I like doctors room
[03:05:32] would I pay 285 Cosmic fragments for a
[03:05:35] doctor's robe
[03:05:40] probably I probably would
[03:05:48] trash Heroes you have yeah I don't
[03:05:50] really have good curios either this
[03:05:52] house was just like yeah sure
[03:05:57] preservation
[03:05:59] I refuse
[03:06:15] all right second plane
[03:06:16] nice selection and value why is that
[03:06:19] whoa whoa whoa whoa oh that's good oh
[03:06:20] look at this elite elite elite we could
[03:06:23] do we could do a lead and then go down
[03:06:25] and then go back up boom and then we get
[03:06:26] a chest and then we move we go to the
[03:06:28] Swarm and then we go here and then
[03:06:30] gaming and then yeah or maybe the chest
[03:06:32] all right easy

[03:07:03] I actually like this
[03:07:05] uh this is good too well it's eight
[03:07:07] percent
[03:07:08] I ironically really like this this tooth
[03:07:11] because I feel like some of them are
[03:07:12] really good at destruction
[03:07:13] but I don't know if that's just me that
[03:07:14] likes it because I like gambling and
[03:07:16] rerolling
[03:07:20] but this one I mean this is only eight
[03:07:22] percent I mean it is good
[03:07:25] I mean and it's for the boss
[03:07:41] I'm gonna take this I like three rules
[03:07:46] champ the tooth is the most useless
[03:07:48] curio ever
[03:07:51] [ __ ] you you're the most useless curio
[03:07:54] ever

[03:08:36] no [ __ ] no curios
[03:08:53] oh this is good
[03:09:03] cataclysmic variable has been taken now
[03:09:06] when we use our path resonance it will
[03:09:07] convert our HP to a shield and that is
[03:09:09] very progress enhanced Beacon
[03:09:12] select a domain to give it an enhanced
[03:09:14] Beacon all right well we're gonna go do
[03:09:15] this Elite right now

[03:09:34] oh is that bad for bushwant no I'll be
[03:09:36] fine
[03:09:38] yeah that's the Swarm
[03:09:46] caution does not mean
[03:09:55] trickier to crack it's fine though
[03:09:57] because once you heal herself with her
[03:09:58] [ __ ] technique

[03:31:21] helping them we have to do gambas just
[03:31:23] to make it fair
[03:31:25] I'm pretty sure this does nothing here
[03:31:26] because we're about to do yeah so that

[03:32:28] known what to do I've never done it
[03:32:29] before no copy I'm not even joking I've
[03:32:31] never done it before
[03:32:33] why are all my characters on [ __ ]
[03:32:34] life support bro
[03:32:39] thank you
[03:32:40] Elite always Elite oh I can't know that
[03:32:42] zero though that's kind of monkey
[03:32:46] trouble ahead don't step on bonfire oh
[03:32:50] wait
[03:32:50] does that actually do anything
[03:32:55] let's wait
[03:33:04] I don't think it does right
[03:33:08] oh
[03:33:12] that just happened to my HP Lucha
[03:33:15] kiss
[03:33:16] one kiss
[03:33:19] those are those are for you
[03:33:25] Eternal sleep
[03:33:31] hahaha
[03:33:38] a quick divination
[03:33:53] usually don't like the ultimate bronya
[03:33:55] Buffs but when I have five skill points
[03:33:57] I think it's worth it
[03:34:02] dude look at that damage man look at
[03:34:05] that Mamma Mia
[03:34:08] let's just dude it's just too easy it's
[03:34:10] just too it's just simple trigonometry
[03:34:13] a team of five stars actually so
[03:34:19] true
[03:34:20] but [ __ ] you
[03:34:28] E2 or not D2 all of our characters are
[03:34:30] e0
[03:34:35] damage
[03:34:37] four one three and then oh
[03:34:40] that's on one Target only
[03:34:50] lend me your strength
[03:34:58] tangyun clears three of these characters
[03:35:00] I fear
[03:35:02] maybe if she could get her head back on
[03:35:04] her shoulders
[03:35:07] sorry that was weird uncalled for I'm
[03:35:08] sorry uh okay we're gonna do these all
[03:35:12] suck these all suck these all suck we
[03:35:15] don't have a follow-up attack unless we
[03:35:16] play blade
[03:35:25] but there's technically an Elation thing
[03:35:27] Synergy so we'll take an Elation one
[03:35:50] the socks but whatever
[03:35:54] chat
[03:35:56] I really want to do this Elite
[03:35:58] Elite Freight of the countdown
[03:36:01] what are we thinking
[03:36:03] I think the elite is still probably
[03:36:05] worth it
[03:36:08] because usually the countdown doesn't
[03:36:09] matter unless you go like Plus past six
[03:36:18] yeah we'll be fine
[03:36:19] which you will yeah but we'll get like
[03:36:21] seven or something who cares
[03:36:24] caution does not mean cowardice
[03:36:37] didn't you say that we're in afraid of
[03:36:39] the countdown I'm not afraid of anything
[03:36:41] maybe one thing I'm afraid of
[03:36:55] Eternal sleep
[03:37:01] okay why are you chat spamming women
[03:37:03] stop
[03:37:04] that is not true why can't I do why
[03:37:07] can't I [ __ ] basic attack what the
[03:37:08] [ __ ] is this enemy
[03:37:10] cringe enemy dude
[03:37:31] okay that was pretty cool
[03:37:36] quick definition
[03:37:44] I see through you
[03:37:49] I played get if I played gentian and go
[03:37:52] to gym am I a weeaboo
[03:37:55] what the [ __ ] does that mean
[03:37:58] I mean if you play Gadget at the gym
[03:38:02] oh that is a bit concerning but
[03:38:06] I mean it's better than not doing it so
[03:38:09] it's better than not going to the gym so
[03:38:11] I mean I respect it
[03:38:14] and yank
[03:38:16] the Redemption you need to get built for
[03:38:19] Xiao so that he could accept you
[03:38:25] this battle is unavoidable
[03:38:29] bro he's literally right next
[03:38:47] foreign
[03:39:07] [Music]
[03:39:28] Cello's dead how's it looking surely
[03:39:30] okay yeah
[03:39:32] yin and yang [ __ ] I didn't mean to
[03:39:35] that's fine nice
[03:39:40] uh
[03:39:43] reset
[03:39:45] I should not have reset it should have
[03:39:46] too much crit rates I don't want to take
[03:39:47] the Critter one but whatever
[03:39:51] uh this is fine I guess whatever I'm
[03:39:54] lucky
[03:39:55] nice crew damage is good but we want
[03:39:58] more destruction blessings
[03:40:01] so we're gonna take this
[03:40:03] 14 destruction blessings poggers
[03:40:07] now we do a commuting device
[03:40:09] we fight the boss
[03:40:11] I'm gonna reroll for the boss though
[03:40:13] nice
[03:40:15] all right surely okay
[03:40:22] we have two consists there's no [ __ ]
[03:40:24] way we lose the Kafka
[03:40:31] the deer is like affecting is good if we
[03:40:33] get the Allies recover one skill point
[03:40:35] that's good
[03:40:37] but I think Kafka we're fine because it
[03:40:40] kafka's weak to imaginary and also we
[03:40:42] have two cleanses
[03:40:45] I think the deer is like kind of [ __ ]
[03:40:47] annoying
[03:40:49] also yeah has the crowd control resist
[03:40:52] right
[03:40:56] yeah the deer does give us the skill
[03:40:57] points which is nice
[03:41:01] but we might lose the deer I'm playing
[03:41:03] it safe man
[03:41:07] I said I wasn't playing it safe this run
[03:41:09] which is true but for Kafka I mean and
[03:41:11] we get to to see Kafka look at her
[03:41:13] look at how much taller she is on us
[03:41:15] this is dude I'm Kafka and this is you
[03:41:17] guys this is like our high difference me
[03:41:19] and chat
[03:41:35] repent
[03:41:39] sounds a lot like Lament
[03:41:43] yin and yang
[03:41:46] all things
[03:41:51] things
[03:41:53] 18.
[03:41:55] what the [ __ ] did we do 18
[03:41:59] what the [ __ ] was that should I cleanser
[03:42:01] um
[03:42:04] kind of don't wanna ah yeah we might as
[03:42:06] well we have enough skill points here
[03:42:10] moving off skill points to do this and
[03:42:12] then
[03:42:14] and then that hung Tripoli
[03:42:17] [Music]
[03:42:25] OS this is 690k that's pretty good
[03:42:32] for sure
[03:42:39] how tall are you in centimeters what the
[03:42:41] [ __ ] is a centimeter at least at least
[03:42:44] 10. at least 10.
[03:42:57] yeah tell me that in Freedom Units
[03:43:00] brother I only speak in Freedom Units
[03:43:10] I'm like two meters no big deal no big
[03:43:13] deal
[03:43:13] no big deal
[03:43:17] I don't want to waste too much damage on
[03:43:19] this phase because the next phase is
[03:43:20] about to come yep come
[03:43:22] yep come
[03:43:24] dude the the blessing that heals when
[03:43:26] you heal it heals your additional
[03:43:28] characters when your one character heals
[03:43:30] put it on screen if this is edited it
[03:43:32] literally is so good switch on will heal
[03:43:33] herself and then it also heals everyone
[03:43:35] else
[03:43:36] [ __ ] is broken
[03:43:37] can I hit this let's hit it
[03:43:41] all right
[03:43:44] take a guess
[03:43:47] that's the one I said was broken wow
[03:43:49] thank you chatter
[03:43:54] a quick divination strength
[03:44:02] militia is useless here no
[03:44:05] he ensures a safe victory
[03:44:18] this is so free now it's literally
[03:44:20] impossible for us to lose
[03:44:27] it's literally impossible for us to lose
[03:44:28] now there is nothing Kafka could do that
[03:44:31] would make us lose she could try hey I
[03:44:34] dare her to try matter fact
[03:44:45] okay that kind of hurt a little
[03:44:47] but it's okay
[03:45:00] foreign
[03:45:07] I'm Gonna Save this
[03:45:16] okay here's what we're gonna do we're
[03:45:18] gonna fully buff our dad hung and buy
[03:45:19] better than a then we're gonna do a
[03:45:21] three and three right a three stack
[03:45:23] normal attack and then we're gonna Alt
[03:45:24] with all of the Buffs that we get here
[03:45:26] because you can snapshot it if you use
[03:45:28] your alt in the same turn without it
[03:45:29] ending you keep the Buffs that your uh
[03:45:31] enhanced skill uh uh basic attack gave
[03:45:33] you but we want to use it on the second
[03:45:35] phase not the first so this attack has
[03:45:37] to kill her it will it will yes nice
[03:45:39] okay 490k easy and now but we're still
[03:45:42] buffing
[03:45:45] I'm gonna press R after she hits me just
[03:45:47] be safe can we press R here
[03:45:48] if I should press start earlier all good
[03:45:51] and then we all have to proc the water
[03:45:52] field and then we win the game
[03:45:53] and then yup that happens Boom the
[03:45:55] [ __ ] yup the first one carries us
[03:45:57] luocha carries us we just went easy as
[03:45:59] that
[03:46:00] was clearing with Natasha I will later
[03:46:03] not now
[03:46:06] do this you chose to do this
[03:46:09] ah
[03:46:12] has any worse than skill better for
[03:46:15] pre-e2 why
[03:46:16] if you need energy sure
[03:46:20] but you lose out on the damage bonuses
[03:46:34] like if you need the energy yeah go
[03:46:35] ahead
[03:46:40] where's those are Talent socks yeah
[03:46:44] is it more though I don't think it's
[03:46:45] more
[03:46:47] oh actually it might be
[03:46:50] I don't know we've entered the storm I
[03:46:53] am not confident enough in my answer
[03:46:56] I mostly know that you wanna
[03:46:57] um
[03:46:59] what the [ __ ] should I do here too
[03:47:04] it's more relevant the alting after your
[03:47:07] boss is more relevant if you need um
[03:47:10] if you don't have your alts like here
[03:47:12] because then you get your all's during
[03:47:13] the same turn
[03:47:16] one percent
[03:47:19] dude usually if you get get the plane
[03:47:20] three it's easy playing three is the
[03:47:21] [ __ ] East dude if you make it the
[03:47:23] plane three you win true I don't think
[03:47:25] I've ever wiped that plane three
[03:47:27] we actually win should I replace all my
[03:47:29] curios
[03:47:30] I can't replace all my curios
[03:47:55] do it for doubters
[03:47:58] [ __ ] it was always that gonna happen
[03:48:06] wait what the [ __ ] is Family Ties
[03:48:12] wait
[03:48:15] does that count here
[03:48:19] or is it replaced I mean
[03:48:23] Kendrick reference
[03:48:31] that's good
[03:48:34] okay that's really good what the [ __ ]
[03:48:35] that was really good
[03:48:43] two destroyed curios that's [ __ ] 60
[03:48:45] then
[03:49:05] hello squirrel
[03:49:15] um
[03:49:19] this is fine
[03:49:23] I could take 20 crit damage
[03:49:29] sure
[03:49:31] I probably should have checked her to
[03:49:32] store first but I don't care I don't
[03:49:34] care there's no way there's something
[03:49:35] that's I wanted that no actually I don't
[03:49:37] actually yeah I shook on that
[03:49:42] actually no I think I would have saved I
[03:49:44] generally think I would say my curios
[03:49:45] for the end I don't think it was worth
[03:49:46] the 300
[03:49:48] yeah
[03:49:51] all right we keep going
[03:50:00] so I can get my just my disruption if I
[03:50:02] do that then that then that'll be plus
[03:50:04] really five I could get it to six if I
[03:50:06] get six I do there and then down and
[03:50:08] then there and then there
[03:50:11] can we do Elite
[03:50:14] you can also do swarm
[03:50:24] it could have gotta destroyed and give
[03:50:25] you damage oh it doesn't work like that
[03:50:27] damn that would have been pogged down
[03:50:29] yeah let's do Elite but I could do swarm
[03:50:31] first
[03:50:33] no it's just delete it
[03:50:39] caution does not mean cowardice
[03:50:50] I don't have robe anymore I have to be a
[03:50:52] bit careful
[03:50:59] all right I can Auto Battle this I'm
[03:51:00] pretty sure there's no way we lose here
[03:51:06] even if our [ __ ] Auto Battle just did
[03:51:08] what they just did
[03:51:17] repay
[03:51:20] ment
[03:51:22] okay you know what I don't trust out a
[03:51:24] battle
[03:51:32] we've entered the storm to guard and
[03:51:36] defense crush them
[03:51:40] perfect search
[03:51:49] fog
[03:51:51] Heaven search
[03:51:58] quit divination
[03:52:01] quick divination
[03:52:15] coming soon
[03:52:23] I should use my skill but I don't think
[03:52:26] it matters
[03:52:51] S1
[03:53:03] [Music]
[03:53:06] all right we're good
[03:53:15] sagacious discernment
[03:53:27] all right winnable
[03:53:31] skip
[03:53:35] these are kind of useless whatever
[03:53:48] oh I could okay if I go here it's four
[03:53:51] then five and six
[03:53:53] I think reward is better than skipping
[03:53:55] reward we're gonna do reward we'll get
[03:53:56] it to six instead of five [ __ ] it I
[03:53:58] think it's worth it unless our rewards
[03:54:00] sucks balls that should be worth it
[03:54:02] this doesn't look like it's gonna be
[03:54:03] that good
[03:54:09] nothing happened
[03:54:18] wow now we get that
[03:54:21] dude no [ __ ] way nothing happens
[03:54:28] oh that's just unlucky
[03:54:33] I heard a let me upgrade some stuff
[03:54:39] this needs to be upgraded 50 less damage
[03:54:41] that's too easy
[03:54:42] uh and then the last thing we upgrade
[03:54:45] this is really good
[03:54:52] this could be good
[03:54:55] it was also quite nice there's a lot of
[03:54:57] Defense
[03:55:12] look at this
[03:55:13] night Beyond pyre
[03:55:19] Al please give me damage please give me

[03:55:30] beat it
[03:55:31] [ __ ] you swarm

[03:55:41] surely you win this right
[03:55:52] yet again
[03:56:00] blade instead of Braun no not instead of
[03:56:02] bronya
[03:56:04] blade would be instead of someone else
[03:56:06] if I do want to play blade but I think
[03:56:08] it'll be fine we have really good
[03:56:10] supports even if our tree's not done or
[03:56:11] whatever we're gonna open it on this
[03:56:18] we have way too much crit rate though I
[03:56:19] if I want to be smart I go for a crit
[03:56:21] damage uh body but
[03:56:24] I would lose my two-piece
[03:56:43] your team is unkillable clueless
[03:56:46] Clueless
[03:57:02] Believers are seven for your points
[03:57:13] oh

[03:59:40] here and then I'm not gonna e on brania
[03:59:42] just in case I have to alt f4 but surely
[03:59:44] We're not gonna have to all right
[03:59:47] [ __ ] this guy
[04:00:00] don't get complacent
[04:00:09] all right let's go
[04:00:17] time to die there's literally no way we
[04:00:19] lose
[04:00:34] how many reset I didn't reset my game
[04:00:37] crashed once also at the ratio
[04:00:41] also this is our first try on stream
[04:00:50] nice
[04:00:54] lend me your strength
[04:00:59] 5 25k okay
[04:01:04] that's fine
[04:01:05] that's fine nothing major it's fine
[04:01:28] no we just break everything here
[04:01:31] little bro is tickling the boss dude
[04:01:33] it's difficulty five the boss has a lot
[04:01:35] of HP even if we do a lot of damage look
[04:01:39] look look I'll show you we do this like
[04:01:41] there's gonna be a big amount of damage
[04:01:42] okay I don't even want to alt whatever
[04:01:44] well that's awkward now
[04:01:46] that is not what I wanted to happen
[04:01:55] that's a lot of damage though we're not
[04:01:57] tickling them
[04:01:59] okay wait we need to weakness break
[04:02:00] these [ __ ]
[04:02:03] I also need to watch this field out ASAP
[04:02:09] yep yep yep another truck goes again a
[04:02:14] little skill to proc our field actually
[04:02:15] do we even need to no we don't need to
[04:02:29] yin and yang
[04:02:31] okay all right everybody's gonna go
[04:02:33] twice in a row here because we're gonna
[04:02:34] kill enemies so we do this
[04:02:36] there we go again
[04:02:38] this time we do uh uh and one and then
[04:02:40] we brought it here
[04:02:42] and then we do two I wish I probably
[04:02:44] should have said one more skill point
[04:02:45] but it's fine
[04:03:04] I'll see you off
[04:03:07] how much HP does that monster have too
[04:03:09] [ __ ] much dude that's the answer
[04:03:17] this thing hurts I'm afraid
[04:03:19] I need to kill it fast before it um
[04:03:22] yeah before it gets too hard I stayed up
[04:03:25] until 2 A.M
[04:03:45] okay we should beat phase one here but I
[04:03:48] want to make sure I kill the odds before
[04:03:50] it's too late
[04:03:51] it's fine
[04:04:01] should I kill this or should I kill this
[04:04:02] I'll probably kill this
[04:04:08] [ __ ]
[04:04:10] oh you know we go again it's all good
[04:04:16] nice that's good that's good that's good

[04:04:30] path of trailblaze is very early I'll
[04:04:31] show it after if you are using free to
[04:04:33] play Team just just move to your path
[04:04:35] get almost easy
[04:04:37] what was that those are hunting now

[04:04:39] Kill
[04:04:40] uh uh Lewis is next we're gonna do a
[04:04:43] three
[04:04:47] it's fine
[04:04:49] Okay I lied this is actually not fine
[04:04:55] I chose the wrong
[04:04:56] again I should have given my environment
[04:04:57] or a crit damage body not crit rate can
[04:04:59] I see much good already has
[04:05:01] oh okay well you also get more Korean or
[04:05:04] basic attacks so I guess it doesn't show
[04:05:06] all of it right now
[04:05:07] because we're getting more through other
[04:05:09] things uh we'll do this
[04:05:11] I don't need to yeah that's fine

[04:12:17] stream he's just too good he's
[04:12:23] he's too good
[04:12:27] only one scam okay but that's because I
[04:12:29] didn't know I would have played launcher
[04:12:31] with you guys are like oh no
[04:12:33] but so it's your fault you guys scammed
[04:12:35] yourselves DJ Khaled you played yourself
[04:12:37] in life there's roadblocks
[04:12:41] boom
[04:12:47] [Music]
[04:12:51] and we played well I actually played
[04:12:53] well that was a display of skill and
[04:12:56] talent kameless I say A Gifted big fan
[04:12:58] also for those of you wondering
[04:13:00] we are not that uh into our trial so I
[04:13:05] know a lot of people if this made into
[04:13:06] video I'm feeling like oh my God you
[04:13:07] need whale characters if if you don't
[04:13:09] have this completed you might well you
[04:13:11] could do remembrance I've seen people do
[04:13:13] it with four star characters like March
[04:13:14] 7th on Remembrance and on Harmony
[04:13:17] no preservation not Harmony
[04:13:18] but but for Destruction it helps or you
[04:13:22] could just complete this and then do
[04:13:24] swarm because like a roguelike it gets
[04:13:26] easier the more you clear I just want to
[04:13:27] do it before getting a lot of things I
[04:13:29] don't even know what I have it in check
[04:13:31] but I'm sure I have some things
[04:13:34] remember this is winnable with full
[04:13:36] combo with earliest hard yeah
[04:13:37] remembrance I saw it looks insane like
[04:13:39] remembrance is insane for regular
[04:13:41] civilian universe so I see what's also
[04:13:42] insane for this and then I saw like a
[04:13:44] free to play Team really easily clear
[04:13:46] with uh I forget which one it was either
[04:13:48] preservation or abundance
[04:13:50] I don't know but it was like a March 7th
[04:13:52] thing I don't
[04:13:54] anyways
[04:13:56] you want destruction plus one okay for
[04:13:58] this build that we did not to talk about
[04:14:00] it a bit for this build that we did you
[04:14:02] want destruction with preservation
[04:14:03] because you want like defensive utility
[04:14:05] also some of the hot ones are really
[04:14:07] nice like the actions Advance forward
[04:14:08] but usually you want destruction with
[04:14:10] preservation so you don't die and then
[04:14:12] we play you play like a carry like blade
[04:14:15] or down hung ill that hung it was kind
[04:14:16] of broken and then yeah
[04:14:22] still a scammer
[04:14:24] Frick you
[04:14:34] preservation socks wait which one was it
[04:14:36] then let me see let me see I want to
[04:14:37] make sure I I know which one I'm talking
[04:14:38] about uh
[04:14:45] uh is this the video what is this video
[04:14:52] it's remembrance it's remembrance okay
[04:14:55] yeah it is Remembrance
[04:14:58] okay uh
[04:15:02] update I was talking about remembrance
[04:15:04] as like the pretty easy cheese one we
[04:15:08] can try that though
[04:15:11] you sound sicker than before yeah I've
[04:15:13] been screaming for four hours
[04:15:17] ah
[04:15:27] okay chat here's the plan
[04:15:31] I like who's wrong I think she's really
[04:15:32] good I'm very happy with her
[04:15:35] um
[04:15:36] I don't know if this is just me being
[04:15:38] bad but I still think The Witcher is
[04:15:39] like the comfiest character in the world
[04:15:40] by far not even close but which one
[04:15:42] gives you crit rate and CC uh resist so
[04:15:45] very very paw character uh and you get
[04:15:47] like you just get a lot of Buffs so and
[04:15:49] she heals so very fog uh with that said
