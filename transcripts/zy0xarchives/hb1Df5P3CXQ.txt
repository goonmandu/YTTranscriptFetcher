[00:32:07] go Mar or you could go substats
[00:32:12] um although if I'm being
[00:32:17] honest I guess it's just because of sub
[00:32:19] stats but is there a reason to go 20 hp
[00:32:21] instead of like 36 crit rate but anyways
[00:32:25] I guess just for the sub stats uh flower

[00:45:09] okay
[00:45:11] chat oh I was actually thinking of
[00:45:13] making a a a nevet coso video but I
[00:45:16] didn't so it is what it is let me turn
[00:45:18] my music
[00:45:22] down uh okay I mean you guys don't need
[00:45:25] an introduction to this AA [ __ ]
[00:45:27] broken net [ __ ] broken uh four stars
[00:45:31] yeah yeah yeah the five star of these
[00:45:34] matters are insane the four stars don't
[00:45:36] exist well SRO is broken but like I mean
[00:45:39] I guess not everyone has SRO yet if you
[00:45:41] okay if you don't have SRO you don't
[00:45:42] have them C6 then you're happy cuz sra's
[00:45:44] broken
[00:45:46] Barbara you don't really want more than
[00:45:49] one
[00:45:51] Barbara Yen Fe is not bad her
[00:45:55] C4 uh makes her a decent
[00:45:59] support right there's situations where
[00:46:01] you can shield with her apply pyro you
[00:46:03] can go thrilling tails you can go
[00:46:05] favonius pro prototype
[00:46:09] Amber so yen is fine uh I don't like the
[00:46:13] thing with okay the thing
[00:46:16] is these supports kind of don't make
[00:46:18] sense with like these characters don't
[00:46:20] really make sense with nevet but for
[00:46:22] Kaza like you know if you want Yen
[00:46:24] that's fine she could be a Carri s's
[00:46:27] broken Barbara's whatever you don't
[00:46:29] really want Barbara constellations like
[00:46:30] who cares
[00:46:33] um s makes sense no he doesn't like
[00:46:35] yolan makes sense with net child's
[00:46:38] [ __ ] passive makes sense but cincho
[00:46:40] doesn't really like you're using him in
[00:46:42] the other team but you can pull for
[00:46:44] nevet and get S for your other team um
[00:46:47] anyways and then weapon
[00:46:50] Banner what matter hi M dolphin hard
[00:46:53] stuck on floor 12 can you pull for on my
[00:46:57] account and fix
[00:47:00] it RAV this for 5,000
[00:47:04] bits
[00:47:07] um wait do you want me to pull for
[00:47:10] you like are you like do you have are
[00:47:13] you just chilling on the
[00:47:25] Primos
[00:47:34] yes all right [ __ ] it oh we might do
[00:47:36] viewer PS for arino by the way okay [ __ ]
[00:47:38] it DM me your stuff on Discord make sure
[00:47:40] it's me
[00:47:41] though I'm down [ __ ] it I don't
[00:47:44] care he's guaranteed it's okay we'll get
[00:47:47] him early okay this Banner
[00:47:50] um so in case you don't know this is
[00:47:54] what you should know these five stars
[00:47:55] are [ __ ] insane uh to of the Eternal
[00:47:57] flow is actually not Niche by the way
[00:47:59] people like when it first came out
[00:48:01] before finina sure but now with finina
[00:48:03] you could just slap this on any
[00:48:04] character that wants a charge attack
[00:48:06] toome of Eternal flow if you're running
[00:48:07] finina and it's [ __ ] it is really
[00:48:09] good um it's not like the most versatile
[00:48:14] one cuz you still need finina in your
[00:48:16] team right uh and it does give you HP
[00:48:19] but it's like 88% crit damage which
[00:48:22] makes it just good I hate using the wiki
[00:48:25] by the way but it's fine uh and then you
[00:48:26] get HP which doesn't matter for most of
[00:48:28] your characters but then you also get
[00:48:30] 14% time three charge attack damage and
[00:48:33] energy which is like really [ __ ] good
[00:48:35] if you're charge attacking but you need
[00:48:36] freeer team so if you have free team and
[00:48:38] you like charge attack on like [ __ ]
[00:48:39] Yen or like Scara or like any Catalyst
[00:48:42] like CLE or some [ __ ] that's nean yenan
[00:48:46] that's it no you can charge back on
[00:48:47] Scara your rotation Scar's rotation
[00:48:49] changes based on your
[00:48:50] weapon also charj has more
[00:48:52] AOE uh you could also use it on Yen you
[00:48:56] could use it on I'd assume jeso but not
[00:48:59] like jzo normal attacks I I hate hazo
[00:49:01] Char attack but it has a different ICD
[00:49:03] so you can
[00:49:06] um Sara is not a catalyst I said Scara
[00:49:09] sorry sorry I said wander scar mush
[00:49:12] wander wander not not
[00:49:16] Sara anyways it's also 88% crit damage
[00:49:20] so
[00:49:22] like but yes you mostly pull it for nlet
[00:49:25] though um it's just that now with finina
[00:49:28] it's a bit it's a lot more versatile
[00:49:29] which is cool oh yeah there's also
[00:49:32] rizzly I forgot rizzly existed uh rizley
[00:49:35] the thing with rizzly is c0 you're not
[00:49:38] charge attacking as much C1 you are c0
[00:49:40] you're not as much it won't be as good
[00:49:42] as his weapon but it's definitely good
[00:49:44] cuz again 88 crit damage and then
[00:49:48] also yeah if you're weaving in a charge
[00:49:51] attack in your rotation which you should
[00:49:52] it'll give you a lot of damage and you
[00:49:53] get some energy so yeah
[00:49:57] all right anyways uh the four stars
[00:50:00] other than fav Lance and arguably the
[00:50:02] great sword kind of suck balls though no
[00:50:04] one talks about wi and song the flute
[00:50:06] I'd rather [ __ ] shove a flute on my
[00:50:07] ass uh minen I don't know what this is
[00:50:10] called is [ __ ] yeah exactly I don't
[00:50:12] even know what it's called and then fav
[00:50:14] great sword is good but the Claymore
[00:50:16] like fav is good but Claymore characters
[00:50:18] don't usually go f like there's not as
[00:50:20] many good Claymore supports that are
[00:50:21] going fav uh and then the the Lance is
[00:50:24] really good so I'm not a big fan of the
[00:50:26] four stars overall but the five stars
[00:50:28] are cracked and then um like Freedom
[00:50:29] stor is really
[00:50:31] good saw you question mark why are you
[00:50:34] Dory like exactly this is what I mean
[00:50:36] when I say the the Claymore the the
[00:50:39] supports aren't that good and they're
[00:50:40] not usually going fav there's good
[00:50:42] Claymore characters like bet like
[00:50:44] [ __ ] uh what's her name Navia but
[00:50:46] they're not going
[00:50:49] fath but you can't like five is it's
[00:50:51] still a good weapon like you
[00:50:54] know you put on razor
[00:51:05] anyways FAL best girl dude I [ __ ]
[00:51:09] love fishell you know this but the thing
[00:51:11] is you're not running FAL on what is
[00:51:12] This
[00:51:13] minen
[00:51:25] Waltz
[00:51:28] the viers Ws is probably the oldest of
[00:51:30] all the ballroom dancers and it's very
[00:51:32] rich in history it dates back to the
[00:51:35] 18th century and it differs from the
[00:51:37] normal ws and it's twice the
[00:51:40] speed anyways visual has a good weapon
[00:51:43] the the the craftable freeto playay
[00:51:44] Claymore [ __ ] what am
[00:51:46] I please don't clip this stream the
[00:51:49] craftable font 10 bow gives you a lot of
[00:51:54] stats it's good not Claymore bow it's
[00:51:56] good it gives you a lot of stats uh but
[00:51:58] obviously you get like stringless or
[00:51:59] whatever if you you know there's better
[00:52:01] weapons but it's good it's a good free
[00:52:02] playay
[00:52:04] option not Claymore bow uh before we
[00:52:08] okay before we before we get to actually
[00:52:12] playing genin and maybe star rail uh

[01:09:04] literally at an arcade in LA with like
[01:09:08] they can vouch I think bra literally was
[01:09:10] like are you playing the genin event
[01:09:13] right now and I was like [ __ ] you that
[01:09:14] literally happened I was at the AR dude

[01:09:19] it was like well okay it resets 2 a.m.
[01:09:21] La time it was like 1:00 a.m. and like I
[01:09:23] was just doing the potion event okay it

[01:28:52] always will be my favorite viewer
[01:29:00] I I'm going to be honest though when I
[01:29:01] play shenyun I think deluke e is like a
[01:29:03] waste of your life it is literally the
[01:29:05] worst piece of garbage in the game it's
[01:29:08] like why the [ __ ] if all of my plunge
[01:29:11] attacks are doing 4 42% damage am I
[01:29:15] blogging this with my face cam no 4 42%
[01:29:17] plus 176 why would I do 160 or
[01:29:23] 170
[01:29:24] it's still good no it's not it's
[01:29:26] actually terrible you use it at the end
[01:29:27] of your rotation for energy that's it
[01:29:29] it's so bad it's actually like not even
[01:29:32] cable I'm sorry that's toxic
[01:29:41] though atox why do you like
[01:29:44] Shia it Stacks Crimson witch Crimson
[01:29:47] witch player sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[01:29:51] I'm sorry however uh yeah get with the
[01:29:54] times buddy also you have like Z but I'm
[01:29:57] not playing for Reena uh Z objection
[01:30:01] objection
[01:30:03] okay Guild the dreams get with the times
[01:30:06] buddy cringe stream
[01:30:10] true but yeah uh yeah no crimt is still
[01:30:14] good um it's like a standard set but
[01:30:17] it's not in his best teams it's like
[01:30:20] weird to rest cuz like if you're doing
[01:30:23] this and then PL that's fine but like
[01:30:26] it's usually just a waste of your buff
[01:30:27] up time nym's dream sands on dude it's
[01:30:31] em with crit damage and attack it's not
[01:30:33] even bad I have I over cap on crit rate
[01:30:35] with the other
[01:30:44] pieces best weapon for support Daya
[01:30:46] [ __ ] Forest
[01:30:49] regalia like
[01:30:52] fa
[01:31:01] the Luke are wasted your off time no no
[01:31:02] du's actually good on this team like
[01:31:04] dude I I'm not biased duuke is actually
[01:31:07] it's like Shia's [ __ ] meta right now
[01:31:09] he's like top three and he's not three
[01:31:11] DPS and but yeah it's an inexpensive
[01:31:14] team okay I get it but like and you was
[01:31:16] oh you just like sh the Luke's also
[01:31:19] [ __ ] good but only okay like if
[01:31:22] you're playing here's the thing here's
[01:31:23] the The Duality of duuke if you're
[01:31:25] playing duuke with like yolan and like
[01:31:28] SRO okay duuke being there doesn't
[01:31:32] actually do much okay cuz at that point
[01:31:34] you could just swirl the hydro and you'd
[01:31:35] probably be doing more damage but if
[01:31:37] you're playing in with Shen
[01:31:40] Yun he's pretty
[01:31:45] POG that's why like I was actually
[01:31:47] thinking about it duuke buron is like
[01:31:50] not that bad because okay listen listen
[01:31:53] listen this is going to sound weird this
[01:31:54] is going to sound cope but let's say
[01:31:56] you're playing duuke finina and like
[01:31:58] yolon right yeah you could go anemo
[01:32:00] swirl Hydro you can't really swirl pyro
[01:32:03] on that team but swirl Hydro sure but
[01:32:07] but if you put like baiju there then
[01:32:10] anytime your BYU SS you'll you'll
[01:32:13] burgeon right and and and since du
[01:32:15] Luke's personal damage in that team is
[01:32:17] like not that high burgeoning is not
[01:32:19] even like that much worse than your
[01:32:21] deluke damage so like [ __ ] it
[01:32:28] anyways virgin with crit characters oh I
[01:32:31] didn't mean to go that there uh deluke
[01:32:33] is not really a [ __ ] crit character
[01:32:34] though is he you want em on him anyways
[01:32:37] like you want like yeah you're stacking
[01:32:38] crit but like you're building like 200
[01:32:41] to 300 DM
[01:32:44] anyways so it's not even bad it's like
[01:32:47] bonus damage it's like with kaching
[01:32:49] aggravate like a free to- play uh option
[01:32:52] being like Barbara's last slot is not
[01:32:54] even bad not copion by the way it's
[01:32:56] actually not
[01:32:59] bad Z I played against someone named
[01:33:01] kakomi fan in valerant was it you mods
[01:33:04] first of all ban that guy for playing
[01:33:06] valerant second of all no the [ __ ] it's
[01:33:08] not me third of all I hope you lost
[01:33:10] sorry that's [ __ ] my valerant name is
[01:33:13] like I have it's like flyon or your Shia
[01:33:16] it's not I don't [ __ ] it's not kokomi
[01:33:18] fan although it should be long live
[01:33:22] kokomi
[01:33:27] a sh good for plunge to
[01:33:31] Luke
[01:33:35] what oh if I'm using C6 Bennett I
[01:33:41] mean dude don't talk to me like like
[01:33:45] sure but don't talk to me
[01:33:48] it's why don't you just use
[01:33:52] this 30 6% crit rate is the equivalent
[01:33:55] of 72% crit
[01:34:02] damage where's
[01:34:05] Shas sh gives you 50% and you your burst
[01:34:08] is
[01:34:09] [ __ ] not everyone has a finina dude
[01:34:12] you're playing Shen Yun C6
[01:34:16] Bennett
[01:34:20] anyways wait okay don't just I know
[01:34:22] everyone's going to tighten me cuz
[01:34:24] you're like oh me me but dude who the
[01:34:26] [ __ ] okay I'm sorry do people did did
[01:34:29] anyone in the universe pull for shenyun
[01:34:31] but not
[01:34:32] finina okay everyone's typing
[01:34:39] me
[01:34:41] okay I mean I guess there's two reasons
[01:34:43] why you might but like dude come
[01:34:49] on that claim all button is
[01:34:52] sick
[01:34:55] okay let me finish these
[01:35:00] commissions No Cap me I got her for Shia
[01:35:03] I mean yeah that makes sense like but
[01:35:05] Shia also can use finina which is why
[01:35:07] it's like but yeah I mean
[01:35:11] yeah sh's op only needs C6
[01:35:15] R1
[01:35:17] what this guy is coping that is
[01:35:22] bait dude I'm going to say it like not
[01:35:25] to be a [ __ ] sh constellation hater
[01:35:27] but they're so [ __ ] bad even C dude
[01:35:29] [ __ ] C6 I'm sorry it like it looks so
[01:35:32] good on paper but like dude it's so
[01:35:34] [ __ ] ass to play like I'm sorry like
[01:35:37] it's fun like it's really fun sometimes
[01:35:39] but like half the time it's just like a
[01:35:41] waste of your
[01:35:49] life but
[01:35:52] um
[01:35:54] c0 compared to other c0 I only
[01:35:59] think yeah I mean c0 with premium
[01:36:02] supports which isn't easy there's like
[01:36:04] nevet who's just better and there's like
[01:36:06] arguably I'll height them I mean I think
[01:36:07] I'll height them not just arguably cuz
[01:36:09] also like easy to build and [ __ ] so like
[01:36:11] I'll height them but
[01:36:13] like
[01:36:20] yeah wait where the [ __ ] is the oh
[01:36:22] there's a third one wait where
[01:36:31] oh I like them better than nevet ah
[01:36:35] yes we hecking love the dude I've seen
[01:36:39] some spreadsheet Warriors talking about
[01:36:41] how Net's overrated cuz they don't
[01:36:43] factor in how [ __ ] how AOE works it's
[01:36:46] like a they'll do like a single Target
[01:36:48] Cal of like nevet damage like see it's
[01:36:51] actually like comparable to like who
[01:36:52] it's like dude you are [ __ ]
[01:36:55] delusional I'm sorry dude nlet hits
[01:36:59] everything on your screen at the same
[01:37:01] time you can literally do this it's like
[01:37:04] insane it doesn't even make
[01:37:08] sense
[01:37:17] anyways but I'm also like I'm like the
[01:37:20] biggest alham lover like I think alam's
[01:37:22] [ __ ] broken so
[01:37:24] I'm not gonna I'm not going to argue
[01:37:25] about like Al height them but I'm just
[01:37:26] saying oh wait did I finish my
[01:37:27] commissions why did I teleport
[01:37:32] here first message who's the best daddy
[01:37:35] in genin bro like why do I get these
[01:37:37] first messages today what is happening
[01:37:39] also ignore my quest okay that's
[01:37:41] embarrassing let's let me yeah yo wrong
[01:37:43] okay uh where's my commission oh we're
[01:37:47] done okay we're done we're
[01:37:50] done yo yo yo chill
[01:37:56] well who is it uh maybe
[01:38:00] arino
[01:38:02] um I mean I I vote ala but wait I don't
[01:38:06] know what the what the objective answer
[01:38:08] is maybe rizzly actually rly is
[01:38:13] pretty you can't really see it but it's
[01:38:16] pretty volumptuous
[01:38:22] anyways
[01:38:27] is Navia better than Shia [ __ ] you don't
[01:38:30] you're trying to get me clipped and
[01:38:31] start a war go [ __ ] yourself okay why
[01:38:34] don't stop it
[01:38:37] okay we are not doing meta rankings with
[01:38:40] a character that looks like Taylor Swift
[01:38:41] that's how you get [ __ ] death threats
[01:38:43] in your DMs stay away from
[01:38:49] me I will say Okay purely objective but
[01:38:54] biased so not objective take I think a
[01:38:56] lot of DPSS will be better for you than
[01:39:01] sha if you don't have like in general
[01:39:04] because you might not have a lot of the
[01:39:05] big upgrades but a lot of characters h a
[01:39:07] lot of the uh sha becomes a lot better
[01:39:10] than a lot of the DPS is if you have a
[01:39:12] lot of the upgrades that doesn't mean
[01:39:13] constellations it just means Shan Yun
[01:39:15] finina C6 Horizon which aren't easy to
[01:39:18] get but if you do he becomes a lot
[01:39:19] better but if you don't you don't need
[01:39:21] him well you need him anyways but you
[01:39:24] know what I'm saying like uh
[01:39:31] yeah so sha or Scara okay that's not
[01:39:34] even like come on be let's be let's ask
[01:39:36] real questions okay teachers say
[01:39:38] sometimes there's no dumb questions that
[01:39:40] was a dumb question be [ __ ] for real
[01:39:41] okay I'm
[01:39:44] sorry that was a dumb
[01:39:52] question
[01:39:53] because the okay yo no flame at all but
[01:39:57] the teams where wanders
[01:40:00] like okay no flame no flame actually no
[01:40:03] flame actually no flame but the teams
[01:40:06] where wander is better you Su gross is
[01:40:09] better then wander am I no flame though
[01:40:12] actually no flame actually no flame
[01:40:15] actually no
[01:40:19] flame St
[01:40:22] cl to the
[01:40:35] Wicked no but I like scar is fine like
[01:40:39] scar is fun and I'm sure there's like
[01:40:41] break points where like if you have
[01:40:43] certain characters but not the other
[01:40:44] characters then he's better like I
[01:40:46] there's I don't like get like I like
[01:40:48] genin but I hate [ __ ] comparing [ __ ]
[01:40:50] cuz everything depends so take what I'm
[01:40:51] saying with a grain of salt
[01:40:54] scar is fine but I I think like I
[01:40:57] genuinely think Shia is very expensive
[01:40:59] so it's hard to get as upgrades but if
[01:41:00] you have them he's [ __ ] broken like
[01:41:02] even compared to other characters in
[01:41:03] their upgrades I don't like the like oh
[01:41:04] well every character is good with no
[01:41:06] [ __ ] you even compared to other
[01:41:07] characters with their upgrades he's
[01:41:08] better except like never let Aly them
[01:41:11] and like some weird not some weird but
[01:41:13] like you know some other like team
[01:41:22] stuff
[01:41:27] oh good DPS are just good CU they're
[01:41:28] flexible being flexible is huge but it's
[01:41:30] not the only thing like child's really
[01:41:32] good but he's not like he's like
[01:41:34] technically flexible but meta wise he's
[01:41:36] not meta wise he's just with
[01:41:38] changling but no one's calling him
[01:41:41] bad even though he meta wise is like one
[01:41:47] team or you can play with [ __ ] nevet
[01:41:49] I
[01:41:52] guess
[01:42:01] why this domain honestly I have no
[01:42:04] [ __ ] clue I genuinely don't know how
[01:42:06] I got here no it's [ __ ] Echoes well
[01:42:09] like why why am I
[01:42:22] here
[01:42:26] I don't know man I don't know I don't
[01:42:29] know how was nevet plus Shen Yun um I
[01:42:34] mean sure but
[01:42:38] why like nevet like you know swirl
[01:42:43] Hydro that's
[01:42:46] cool you could say how nlet plus
[01:42:49] literally any character and you can
[01:42:51] [ __ ] three star clear blind folded if
[01:42:54] you're invested correctly so like his
[01:42:56] team is just anything there there's
[01:42:58] better characters than others but you
[01:43:00] could be like oh z i how's never let
[01:43:02] [ __ ] Dory and you're probably going
[01:43:04] to clear but you probably
[01:43:09] shouldn't
[01:43:11] anyways but in that team shenyun is
[01:43:13] basically like uh like Jean and Jean's
[01:43:15] not not bad for nevet Jean's fine like a
[01:43:17] lot of times nevet doesn't need healing
[01:43:19] but I don't know maybe you want to like
[01:43:21] stack your finina faster or something
[01:43:22] it's fine fine it's
[01:43:33] fine how about nevet Kirara yeah why not
[01:43:36] you get a shield if you're not C1 and
[01:43:38] you get uh dendro which is another uh
[01:43:42] proc of his like increased scaling
[01:43:44] passive I think it's
[01:43:48] passive four
[01:43:49] months okay let's do oh wait wait should
[01:43:52] I do the [ __ ] viewer wait they sent
[01:43:54] me their login
[01:44:02] info okay let's do
[01:44:04] it let's pull for those guys net and
[01:44:08] then we'll go back on our
[01:44:15] main uh let me close my screen just so I
[01:44:17] don't leak anything one second do I have
[01:44:20] a full
[01:44:22] screen cam what the [ __ ] is
[01:44:26] this okay never mind what am I doing
[01:44:29] okay my bad this is scuffed I'm sorry um
[01:44:33] okay the great I wanted to full screen
[01:44:36] my cam but whatever because you farm
[01:44:38] villion or do you farm The Million BC
[01:44:41] your isain minus 7 dude what are you

[02:28:03] than black it's worse than Orange it's
[02:28:04] worse than blue it's worse than some

[02:28:09] it's it's I don't know like in the color
[02:28:13] tier list I'm sorry but it's like it's
[02:28:15] not even that high I'm
[02:28:18] sorry I'm sorry like you can disagree

[02:30:43] closer than I
[02:30:48] thought
[02:30:52] I'll be honest I don't know why this is
[02:30:53] my take I don't even hate red I just
[02:30:55] think it's worse than like like I
[02:30:57] wouldn't choose red like if I have a
[02:30:59] skin and there's 20 colors I wouldn't
[02:31:01] click red that's all that's my only take
[02:31:03] I just wouldn't click on red that's all
[02:31:05] the only time I use like a red skin is
[02:31:07] if it's like also like like black or
[02:31:08] some [ __ ] and that that's like cooler
[02:31:11] that's literally
[02:31:15] it you said orange is better wait I love

[03:02:42] same y Mia duuk Yen [ __ ] Hut Shang

[03:03:05] L I am I am not
[03:03:08] a no chatter I am not a
[03:03:12] [ __ ] I am not a closed beta
[03:03:16] tester

[03:03:20] I'm down but I'm
[03:03:24] not o that looks yeah that's good attack
[03:03:27] and CR on
[03:03:40] CR Google
[03:03:43] CBT I hecking love
[03:03:46] CBT
[03:03:51] you think they're going to do a Creator
[03:03:52] experience server for arino I [ __ ]
[03:03:54] hope not holy [ __ ] I hope not I don't
[03:03:55] know I have no clue I actually have no
[03:03:58] clue I mean if I'm into it I'll make a
[03:03:59] video on it you know you'll see but I
[03:04:01] have no [ __ ] clue and I [ __ ] hope
[03:04:05] not I mean I I you guys know my take I
[03:04:08] wish there was nothing literally nothing
[03:04:10] like no information at all for anyone on
[03:04:14] any character until the second they're
[03:04:15] out and then we all experience it
[03:04:17] together do I I think that would be
[03:04:18] healthy no cuz people be like what do I
[03:04:20] do what do I do but I think it would
[03:04:21] just be fun I don't
[03:04:34] care whale take not really you can just
[03:04:36] wait [ __ ] an hour before
[03:04:40] pulling that's what that's what that's
[03:04:42] what G was for the first year so it's
[03:04:43] just like Nostalgia take I
[03:04:46] guess
[03:04:48] remember when kakomi came out I
[03:04:55] remember fix fix your alerts dude I
[03:04:57] don't know what's happening to my
[03:05:03] alerts all right let me let me go
[03:05:12] side definitely will take I mean like
[03:05:15] only if you're pulling for meta which
[03:05:16] like I get a lot of people are it
[03:05:19] doesn't like it it doesn't really matter
[03:05:21] though like okay let me be clear this is
[03:05:24] I think it would be fun not I think
[03:05:25] that's how the game should
[03:05:34] be like yeah the reality is there's
[03:05:37] going to be leaks and so because of that
[03:05:39] everyone needs to know everything about
[03:05:40] a character the second they're out or
[03:05:41] you're behind that's just the
[03:05:43] perspective of it whereas I feel like
[03:05:45] it's more fun if you learn a character
[03:05:47] as a community and you like discover new
[03:05:48] things when they're out do I think that
[03:05:51] that would help people no cuz people
[03:05:52] just want to know what to build so the
[03:05:54] earlier you get that the better because
[03:05:55] then you can decide what to pull and you
[03:05:57] decide if you save your Primos or not so
[03:05:59] like there's benefits to it however
[03:06:02] selfishly I would like to be able to
[03:06:04] learn a character with my friends
[03:06:05] without it being fully discovered the
[03:06:06] second they're out like I have to
[03:06:08] pretend like I literally new character
[03:06:10] comes out I have to know everything
[03:06:12] about them and all their teams before I
[03:06:14] even get to play them so it's like
[03:06:16] chiori came out I'm like yeah just
[03:06:17] another albo you do this this this this
[03:06:19] and then that's it I don't have to think
[03:06:20] about her again like I I
[03:06:22] literally I can tell you how to play and
[03:06:25] build M and my mik's level like [ __ ]
[03:06:26] six oh he's 70 that's not
[03:06:32] bad uncle Z
[03:06:35] Sask
[03:06:39] Sask anyways I'm trying to fix my alerts
[03:06:41] why are they off uh alert
[03:06:46] box
[03:06:50] test wait that didn't make any noise
[03:06:53] wait why are my alerts
[03:06:55] off wait are they off or are they
[03:07:00] muted one
[03:07:11] second we're getting scammed dude
[03:07:16] Maybe
[03:07:22] uh let me just refresh it I guess
[03:07:29] settings dude I actually don't know why
[03:07:31] is it not
[03:07:32] working test
[03:07:35] widgets what I it's
[03:07:46] literally okay legit does not work I
[03:07:48] don't [ __ ]
[03:07:51] know
[03:08:03] uh oh well I fixed it wait but it's this
[03:08:06] thing is
[03:08:09] huge this is a test okay this is a
[03:08:16] test all right [ __ ]
[03:08:21] it all right good
[03:08:24] enough but yeah like you know I get it
[03:08:29] like you
[03:08:31] know I I just wish there was a reason
[03:08:34] for me to like talk to my
[03:08:36] friends I just I want to let me
[03:08:38] experience something
[03:08:46] man
[03:08:54] just talk to them Pepe W
[03:09:06] true like RuneScape okay okay old school
[03:09:08] RuneScape does this thing where like
[03:09:10] they get like streamers or like players
[03:09:12] to test new content before it's out but
[03:09:15] then once it's out they can do it until
[03:09:19] the first person beat it or some [ __ ] so
[03:09:21] that it's like they know what it like
[03:09:22] they play test it and like make sure the
[03:09:24] characters or like the not car like
[03:09:26] content's good or whatever and then when
[03:09:27] it's out they let the like Community
[03:09:30] Discover it and then they they can like
[03:09:32] make stuff on
[03:09:34] it I think it's pretty cool that
[03:09:36] wouldn't work here though
[03:09:38] but you could take acting classes dude
[03:09:42] I'm not a porn
[03:09:46] actor
[03:09:49] like valer no valer is different isn't
[03:09:50] it valer they you actually can make
[03:09:52] early
[03:09:54] content right Val you can make early
[03:09:56] content I'm pretty
[03:10:04] sure you restart your stream did it
[03:10:16] crashed skin equal content LOL W okay
[03:10:21] dude
[03:10:32] okay skip this Banner or
[03:10:36] n nevet
[03:10:39] kazua uh I don't know I would never tell
[03:10:44] you to skip Kaza or to skip nevet
[03:10:46] however there's also AR Lino next so
[03:10:49] honestly just [ __ ] acquire a credit
[03:10:52] card I'm sorry I don't know choose who
[03:10:54] you want the most man they're all really

[03:11:30] worthless okay the problem okay I'm
[03:11:32] going to say this right now I [ __ ]
[03:11:34] hope AR Lino's good for two reasons one
[03:11:38] if everyone's skipping literally
[03:11:40] arguably the best five star or like
[03:11:42] second I would say Nita is more
[03:11:43] impactful but like top two five stars
[03:11:46] and like top like three five star she
[03:11:49] better be [ __ ] good also that's one
[03:11:51] that's one number two is is if if if
[03:11:55] she's if she isn't good it's going to be
[03:11:58] impossible to criticize her because of

[03:42:21] honestly four emblem c0o crowned only
[03:42:25] one Crown
[03:42:32] flower okay this is a good
[03:42:42] [Music]
[03:42:44] flowera A
[03:42:46] W
[03:42:49] uh that's possible I literally have a
[03:42:51] piece like that sorry no one asked I I
[03:42:53] will say you lose three substats by
[03:42:56] running this piece cuz HP like flat
[03:42:58] defense defense is like not good but
[03:43:00] this is really you know a lot of crit
[03:43:02] damage uh like is an impressive
[03:43:05] piece but anyways uh
[03:43:10] Sans that's pretty good that's that's a
[03:43:12] lot of CR you know your it's pretty good
[03:43:17] uh I hope next year for Christmas right
[03:43:21] your your family you know maybe you get
[03:43:22] like a gift and you're like oh I can't
[03:43:24] wait to get this gift and then you open
[03:43:26] it and then inside is is coal and then
[03:43:30] your Christmas is [ __ ] ruined I hope
[03:43:32] that happens to you I don't actually
[03:43:33] hope that happens to you but this is
[03:43:44] uh
[03:43:49] okay unironically this isn't even better
[03:43:51] than mine though you have 60 crit rate
[03:43:54] your HP is on [ __ ] life support
[03:43:56] you're running a crit cir which means
[03:43:57] you probably have HP circlets that are
[03:43:59] dog [ __ ] like that are good but you
[03:44:00] can't use on anyone and then your other
[03:44:02] Emblem characters are running worse
[03:44:03] pieces wait is that even true dude dude
[03:44:05] dude dude dude dude let me see do you
[03:44:07] have any Emblem characters on your team
[03:44:08] okay maybe not okay and and and and and
[03:44:11] you have no other substats here and and
[03:44:13] your your sand is M and it's
[03:44:15] I'm sorry I'm just I'm just tilted cuz
[03:44:17] you have a good uh goblet and I'm
[03:44:18] jealous of it I am jealous of your
[03:44:23] goblet
[03:44:28] however the last yolon that we joined
[03:44:30] was
[03:44:32] better right wasn't it what was it it
[03:44:34] was like 70
[03:44:36] something yeah it was it was it was fav
[03:44:40] yeah it is fav but if you're running fav
[03:44:42] wouldn't you want more of a crit rate
[03:44:43] inclination than a crit damage one
[03:44:47] although I guess it doesn't matter cuz
[03:44:49] you always just weave in a basic you
[03:44:50] like EQ basic or like basic EQ it's not

[04:18:23] all right time to deluke
[04:18:27] everywhere wied is FOB taller than you
[04:18:31] okay okay I joke about a lot of things
[04:18:33] but unironically it's not even close
[04:18:35] like like notice I actually like dude
[04:18:37] F's he's a cool dude I like fob but like
[04:18:40] no dude unironically it's like literally
[04:18:43] LeBron James versus [ __ ] like like
[04:18:46] [ __ ] like like like like like a
[04:18:50] toddler no my
[04:18:59] sword nuclear
[04:19:11] drama
[04:19:18] dude I what dude I saw a
[04:19:23] post I saw dude what the [ __ ] happened
[04:19:25] on Star rail Tik Tok I saw a post of
[04:19:28] people getting mad at someone for like
[04:19:30] using a three star L cone on
[04:19:32] inor what the [ __ ] is yo what is
[04:19:35] happening over there are they okay
[04:19:37] what's
[04:19:41] happening break for like dude who
[04:19:45] cares what the
[04:19:53] [ __ ] you see everyone lose to
[04:19:55] adventurine dude I
[04:19:57] saw like dude God forbid we have a hard
[04:20:01] boss but apparently it was like RNG but
[04:20:04] still I I'm going to be honest this
[04:20:06] might be a toxic take but like dude who
[04:20:08] like if you have to reset a boss three
[04:20:10] times to clear it like boo [ __ ] who
[04:20:12] I'm sorry
[04:20:15] I think there should be like
[04:20:18] um I think there should
[04:20:20] be like you should be able to choose the
[04:20:22] difficulty though it shouldn't just
[04:20:23] default be
[04:20:33] easy cuz it makes sense if you want to
[04:20:35] play Just for story like it makes sense
[04:20:36] but it you shouldn't be punished for
[04:20:38] wanting to play for like the combat of
[04:20:41] like genin or Star rail
[04:20:43] cuz it's kind of like the same in both
[04:20:45] for stuff like
[04:21:02] that there was a player who ran luuka
[04:21:05] attach wait I saw the post of uh it was
[04:21:08] like MAA physical
[04:21:10] MC like I don't know the other two it
[04:21:14] was just like but like like I don't it's
[04:21:16] fine like play who you want like there's
[04:21:18] no shame in like play who you want but
[04:21:21] like you can't have the most cooked comp
[04:21:23] and then
[04:21:24] like oh not Mika Misha
[04:21:36] Misha but it's also story so like for me
[04:21:40] it's like I wish if you had like I I
[04:21:43] like content where if your comp is dog
[04:21:45] [ __ ] you're [ __ ] but like for like a
[04:21:48] main story boss I get that it it should
[04:21:52] you should be able to select an easier
[04:21:53] difficulty like I'm playing just for the
[04:21:55] lore that's
[04:21:57] fine let
[04:21:59] me it's still funny
[04:22:02] though it's still a [ __ ] funny
[04:22:05] call oh my uh dele on MAR by the way so
[04:22:08] it's I might kind of get [ __ ] cuz we
[04:22:10] don't uh have finina here
[04:22:14] outes your
[04:22:19] F to the Wicked playing physical MC in
[04:22:22] 2024 is crazy though yeah it actually

[04:22:45] [Music]
[04:22:48] scared you mean C1 no no C1 does
[04:22:50] something C4 is so bad that it's not
[04:22:52] even worth like it's not even worth
[04:22:55] changing your combo to make your C4 do
[04:23:03] something C1 is so bad wait C1 is not
[04:23:05] good but it's not like useless it's
[04:23:08] basically 50% up time on a bit of damage
[04:23:09] bonus that's it it's not great but it's
[04:23:12] not like terrible it's just okay it's a
[04:23:16] standard constellation so like it's it's
[04:23:18] any standard Banner fivar constellation
[04:23:20] that does something for me is a is a win
[04:23:22] because there's so many standard
[04:23:24] constellations that are just dog
[04:23:26] [ __ ] but yeah like kc1 is just way
[04:23:29] better
[04:23:35] obviously see where's the DPS loss yeah
[04:23:37] it is cuz you don't want to change your
[04:23:38] combo from N2 to
[04:23:41] N3
