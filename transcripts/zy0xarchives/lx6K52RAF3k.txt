[00:23:49] one let me make sure the quality is
[00:23:50] maxed only 720
[00:23:55] sus three genius Society members at the
[00:23:59] same time I knew this interview was a
[00:24:02] bad
[00:24:02] idea screw member 76 sophisticated
[00:24:07] mechanical Aristocrat and renowned
[00:24:10] leader Sor the of than route the
[00:24:14] universe okay he's as sharp as they come
[00:24:17] he'll recognize my Brilliance in an
[00:24:19] instant now I SC that's not his name
[00:24:23] sorry and his astonishing wisdom in the
[00:24:27] field of broadcasting has been duly
[00:24:30] recognized by noose thems a go the
[00:24:34] genius Society hereby confers upon Mr
[00:24:38] Albert the title of member 85 member 81
[00:24:44] Ron
[00:24:45] may she seemed like a elegant person in
[00:24:49] the simulated Universe hey a little
[00:24:51] distant though but what if I ask
[00:24:56] question
[00:24:58] since when does Albert ask bad
[00:25:01] questions no go back this little bird
[00:25:04] has an active

[00:28:19] together three intellectual heavy
[00:28:20] weights from none other than the genius
[00:28:24] Society oh why don't you introduce
[00:28:26] yourselves m murder here to kick us off
[00:28:30] whatever hey here I'm Z the newest
[00:28:33] murder we said remember
[00:28:37] enthusiasm seriously fine hello I'm
[00:28:43] Hera now we're talking and uh let's not
[00:28:47] forget the new face on the Block Madame

[00:29:05] never thought I'd be interviewing all
[00:29:06] three of you at the same time four
[00:29:09] actually hey must have finally
[00:29:11] recognized my
[00:29:14] potential don't get ahead of yourself
[00:29:17] this is a scheduled space station visit
[00:29:20] lucky for you we had time for a show or
[00:29:23] to put it another way participating in
[00:29:25] your program was a way of Max imizing
[00:29:27] the utility of our
[00:29:29] itinerary two birds one
[00:29:33] stone thank
[00:29:35] you uh
[00:29:38] anyhow we saw from the trailer that the
[00:29:41] story is making a return to her of space
[00:29:44] station intelligence available for
[00:29:46] release indicates the following Madam
[00:29:48] Ron May has commandeered one of the
[00:29:51] space station zones for biological
[00:29:53] science
[00:29:55] experiments I like to avoid attracting
[00:29:57] too much attention with my experiments
[00:29:59] yo move back from the mic this is making
[00:30:02] me nervous her was kind enough to lend
[00:30:05] it to me big enough to spread across
[00:30:07] three levels this area is a brand new
[00:30:10] domain waiting for us in version
[00:30:12] 1.6 welcome to her of space station
[00:30:16] seclusion Zone due to the secrecy
[00:30:19] surrounding this Zone there's currently
[00:30:21] not a soul to be found across the whole
[00:30:24] domain rebuttal you got assertion
[00:30:28] excludes the existence of inorganic life
[00:30:30] operating in the
[00:30:32] area naturally as I was saying the story
[00:30:36] is set to unfold in this new domain wait
[00:30:40] so you still need the seclusion Zone rme
[00:30:43] I do my research has encountered a few
[00:30:48] anomalies I was hoping the Trailblazer
[00:30:51] could do me a small favor anything favor
[00:30:55] anything small yeah yeah I'm not sure
[00:30:59] about the second one but this is a
[00:31:03] golden ege for biological science no
[00:31:06] problem too big or too small right in
[00:31:08] version 1.6 is brand new trailb
[00:31:10] continuance crown of the mundane and
[00:31:12] divine TR bees encounter Madame Ron May
[00:31:16] for the first time they'll need to work
[00:31:18] closely with her to solve the headaches
[00:31:21] of her of space station okay for
[00:31:24] example one such headache is the result
[00:31:26] of the little life forms that Ron May
[00:31:28] has been cultivating I'm afraid that's
[00:31:30] the nature of biological science
[00:31:33] surprises and accidents in equal measure
[00:31:36] so true not to mention the SP what I was
[00:31:38] thinking to actually good point than you
[00:31:40] might have thought various crises bubble
[00:31:43] into the surface heard his puppet
[00:31:44] falling prey to an ambush and a new
[00:31:47] provocation that the Geniuses must face
[00:31:49] up to new propagation nothing a small
[00:31:52] favor can't fix right we got the three
[00:31:55] Geniuses here for in Mr Albert's
[00:32:00] previous broadcasts the adoption of a
[00:32:02] light-hearted tone usually indicates the
[00:32:05] presence of a formidable
[00:32:08] challenge my beak is sealed this is a
[00:32:12] top secret experiment but trust me when
[00:32:15] I say that the adventure ahead is a
[00:32:17] journey into both the power and wonder
[00:32:20] of biological science and what better
[00:32:24] way to prepare our Trailblazers than by
[00:32:26] introducing the one and only Madam Ron
[00:32:32] [Music]
[00:32:37] May yo what's she
[00:32:43] doing oh she just playing her
[00:32:46] instrument never
[00:32:50] [Music]
[00:32:53] mind Madame Ron May is an ice type
[00:32:56] character following the path of Harmony
[00:32:59] and member 81 of the genus Society from
[00:33:02] the very beginning her research has
[00:33:05] focused on biological science that's
[00:33:07] right biological science is a boundless
[00:33:10] field ice Harmony I rarely have time for
[00:33:13] leisure and despite being one of the
[00:33:15] founders of the simulated Universe I
[00:33:18] seldom step up to the plate mam Ron may
[00:33:21] I was curious is there a story behind
[00:33:24] your name my name
[00:33:28] my parents organized themselves into a
[00:33:30] flat hierarchical structure my name is
[00:33:33] simply the combination of their surnames
[00:33:37] fascinating what a spellbind a tradition
[00:33:40] I believe you may be laying it on a
[00:33:42] little thick Mr Albert are you hoping
[00:33:46] for something in
[00:33:47] return ah who wouldn't hope for a
[00:33:51] blessing from Madam Ron
[00:33:53] May Trailblazers agree with me then let
[00:33:57] me remind you that a genius's blessing
[00:33:59] isn't always a result of generosity or
[00:34:02] kindness
[00:34:03] meaning aren't you supposed to be
[00:34:06] intelligent you tell me many individuals
[00:34:09] have a hidden side there go Trailblazers
[00:34:13] encounter with Ron may may hold
[00:34:17] surprises spoiler clock I think it's
[00:34:20] time we took a look at what this elegant
[00:34:23] stolar can do on the battlefield don't
[00:34:26] you my basic attack fragrance deals ice
[00:34:29] damage to a single Target while my skill
[00:34:33] stringing slow swirls can increase the
[00:34:35] weakness break efficiency of all eyes
[00:34:38] there's a cut there I heard it my
[00:34:40] weakness bre stream repos and dream
[00:34:44] which creates a field only the most
[00:34:47] beautiful field I've ever seen efficienc
[00:34:49] is pretty I work B Madam within the
[00:34:52] field allies experience an all type
[00:34:55] resistance penetration increase and when
[00:34:57] breaking an enemy's weakness inflict
[00:35:00] them with a mark this Mark has triggered
[00:35:02] on the enemy's next action prolonging
[00:35:04] their weakness break State their action
[00:35:07] and inflicting them with additional ice
[00:35:09] damage you have a knack for exploiting
[00:35:12] an enemy's weakness Ron May I'll say and
[00:35:15] we didn't even mention her technique
[00:35:17] silken serenade which allows the team to
[00:35:20] automatically trigger an effect
[00:35:22] equivalent to her skill at the start of
[00:35:24] the next battle in the simulated
[00:35:26] universe when ronway possesses silk and
[00:35:28] serenade and when an ally attacks a
[00:35:31] simulated Universe enemy the battle is
[00:35:33] entered as if the enemy's weakness was
[00:35:34] attack the attack ignores weakness types
[00:35:37] and can de the
[00:35:39] toughest break your weakness can trigger
[00:35:41] the weakness break effect that
[00:35:42] corresponds to the attacker's own type
[00:35:45] not only that in the simulated Universe
[00:35:48] for every blessing possessed the
[00:35:50] toughness reducing damage of the current
[00:35:52] attack is increased and extra additional
[00:35:55] ice damage is dealt
[00:35:58] well very good that's pretty cool so we
[00:36:00] can break efficiency which is nice
[00:36:02] simulated Universe after Trailblazers
[00:36:05] get to know Ron May another skolar with
[00:36:07] connections to the Gen Society will be
[00:36:09] appearing and this trailblaze continu oh
[00:36:14] I assume you're referring to the
[00:36:16] gentleman with the alabaster head
[00:36:19] Classic Mr
[00:36:21] scrum able to see the gentleman behind
[00:36:24] the mask classic in my
[00:36:28] foot Hera you're being a little harsh
[00:36:33] sounds like you two are well equated
[00:36:35] without further Ado allow me to
[00:36:38] introduce him Dr
[00:36:40] Rael oh my God look at him he's raoing
[00:36:43] everyone with the
[00:36:44] steps wait why am I still
[00:36:48] here okay he hit them with a
[00:36:52] [Music]
[00:36:53] book what is bro
[00:36:55] doing
[00:36:57] he's throwing chalk at
[00:37:01] them bro I
[00:37:05] I ver ratio bro thinks he's pyus doctor
[00:37:09] ratio as he's known imaginary character
[00:37:12] following the path of the hunt he
[00:37:15] belongs to a different news worshipping
[00:37:17] organization he's literally making the
[00:37:20] which is why I can't stand the sight of
[00:37:22] him the genius Society consists of
[00:37:25] vanguards from various Fields who act in
[00:37:28] isolation in contrast the intelligencia
[00:37:31] guild advocates for the dissemination of
[00:37:33] knowledge allowing for a broad Church of
[00:37:36] followers of noose who work towards
[00:37:38] furthering this end question does the
[00:37:42] current Universe derive greater benefit
[00:37:44] from the unparalleled talents of the
[00:37:46] genius Society or the mutual learnings
[00:37:49] of the
[00:37:50] intelligen you sure you want to go there
[00:37:53] you kind of look like him true that's
[00:37:55] not
[00:37:57] is that why Dr ratio joined the
[00:37:59] intelligencia guild a Devotion to
[00:38:01] science a desire to share scientific
[00:38:04] knowledge exactly Dr racio presides over
[00:38:08] a total of 52 academic programs H and
[00:38:11] yells at people until they burst into
[00:38:14] tears strict teachers make for good
[00:38:16] students and any student who makes it to
[00:38:19] the end of a program will be why is she
[00:38:21] moaning like that what do you mean
[00:38:22] respect and an emotional she's not
[00:38:25] moaning ignorance is an ailment the
[00:38:28] expungement of which only our Dr ratio
[00:38:31] can achieve and which entails necessary
[00:38:34] hardship by which you mean the
[00:38:36] destruction of any and all
[00:38:40] self-esteem his Creations have helped
[00:38:42] many worlds look beyond their borders
[00:38:45] and step into the
[00:38:47] future okay we might accidentally be
[00:38:50] discussing perhaps I should intervene Dr
[00:38:54] Rao's desire to cure ignorance with with
[00:38:56] truth is well known it's time for us to
[00:39:00] assess his prowess on the battlefield
[00:39:03] during his basic attack mind is might is
[00:39:06] Dr ratio brandishes his codex dealing
[00:39:08] imaginary damage to a single Target why
[00:39:11] is the question why does he carry a
[00:39:13] they're literally introducing basic
[00:39:14] attack and always doing single Target
[00:39:17] Dam or like [ __ ] whatever element
[00:39:18] damage to a single Target Rao takes that
[00:39:21] to mean hitting people with them
[00:39:23] directly Dr ratio skill
[00:39:27] Wy deals imaginary damage to a single
[00:39:29] Target while his talent
[00:39:32] Kito trigger hand follow attack after
[00:39:36] using his skill
[00:39:38] mecher Dr racio pays close attention to
[00:39:41] his enemy's debuffs during battle the
[00:39:43] more debuffs the enemy has the higher
[00:39:46] the chance of him launching a follow-up
[00:39:48] attack W I like this guy let's not
[00:39:50] forget his ultimate threep Paradox the
[00:39:53] good doctor summons a Leaning Tower and
[00:39:56] through a a series of precations and
[00:39:58] measurements plus a trajectory of
[00:40:00] Maximum pain he imaginary damage and is
[00:40:04] Afflicted with it's also literally a
[00:40:06] [ __ ] look at it when a target with wise
[00:40:08] man's Folly is attacked by an ally of Dr
[00:40:10] racio he launches his talents follow up
[00:40:12] attack against the Target and when using
[00:40:15] his technique mold of idolatry Dr Rao
[00:40:18] creates a dimension and taunts near by
[00:40:20] enemies when attacking an enemy within
[00:40:22] the dimension to enter battle there's a
[00:40:24] chance of reducing the target speed it
[00:40:27] would appear those five statues are made
[00:40:30] in his own image there go Dr ratio
[00:40:34] suffers from a certain degree of
[00:40:36] narcissism a to put it
[00:40:40] mildly also in version 1.6 TR Blazers
[00:40:43] will finally be running into an old
[00:40:46] friend the Elder of two siblings very
[00:40:48] different from the other yet bound to
[00:40:50] we're all the same it's ha's elder
[00:40:54] sister oh
[00:40:57] ha's older
[00:40:58] [Music]
[00:41:02] sister okay I
[00:41:04] mean haa better but she looks chains
[00:41:07] wait that's literally Shia the
[00:41:10] hell let me
[00:41:14] move wait what the [ __ ] this is
[00:41:16] literally Shia what the hell is a
[00:41:19] Quantum type character following the
[00:41:21] path of Destruction whose original body
[00:41:23] was replaced long ago with a permanent
[00:41:26] puppet system the system was construed
[00:41:30] on behalf of the 10 Lord's commission
[00:41:32] the commission agreed that for every
[00:41:34] culprit apprehended she would be
[00:41:36] rewarded with a halfday wakes span she's
[00:41:39] not taller than Chia better than my
[00:41:42] one like her sister Hai is a formidable
[00:41:46] pres on the battlefield sh's basic
[00:41:48] attack Mara
[00:41:51] sual Target enemy her skill iniquity
[00:41:54] obliteration can deal Quantum damage to
[00:41:55] a single Target and adjacent enemies and
[00:41:58] as a judge of the 10 Lord's commission
[00:42:00] shu's Talent is a little out of the
[00:42:03] ordinary whenu and an ally deal damage
[00:42:06] to an enemy's toughness stacks of karma
[00:42:08] are accumulated
[00:42:09] Karma so she's good at trying criminals
[00:42:14] the best when Karma Stacks to the upper
[00:42:16] limit shuei immediately launches a
[00:42:19] follow-up attack on the target enemy
[00:42:20] dealing Quantum damage her ultimate
[00:42:23] Divine cast Quantum damage to single
[00:42:26] Target and toughness depletion that
[00:42:28] ignores weakness types more toughness
[00:42:30] depleted the greater the damage break
[00:42:33] okay she didn't put a mask on but there
[00:42:34] is a CH persective of type wait there
[00:42:37] literally The Mask yeah dude she
[00:42:39] literally LS she just throws it instead
[00:42:41] of wearing it execution to attack an
[00:42:43] enemy and enter battle she deals Quantum
[00:42:45] damage to All
[00:42:48] Enemies yes sir it's time we talked
[00:42:52] about version 1.6 as banners during the
[00:42:55] first pH of version 1.6 in the character
[00:42:58] event War you character and a soul TR
[00:43:02] bases can obtain The Limited five star
[00:43:04] characters Ron May and blade
[00:43:07] respectively kind to mention the
[00:43:09] fourstar character will be joining
[00:43:11] version 1.6 is first phase character
[00:43:14] warp oh it's bandage guy what call phase
[00:43:19] of version 1.6 in the character vet
[00:43:22] warps and dma nice can obtain lied five
[00:43:27] star characters Dr Rao and Kafka
[00:43:31] respectively I wondered when that lady
[00:43:33] might be making a
[00:43:35] return I'll be glad to see the back of
[00:43:38] her then let's not forget like I'd be
[00:43:40] glad to see the back first phas Lon
[00:43:42] event warp the drop rate of the five
[00:43:45] star past self in the mirror will be
[00:43:48] boost and in the Bon reminisence ly cone
[00:43:50] event warp the drop rate of the

[00:57:01] later by a pure fiction event
[00:57:04] subsequently two weeks after that a new
[00:57:06] memory of chaos will start in which case
[00:57:10] each version contains three such updates
[00:57:12] meaning that Trailblazers can obtain a
[00:57:14] maximum of 2,160 Stellar Jades across
[00:57:17] the Forgotten Hall 134 aware what do you
[00:57:20] mean aware in addition the availability
[00:57:22] of we already have a
[00:57:23] 15 ended from 2 weeks to 6 weeks this
[00:57:27] means that when a new phase of memory of
[00:57:29] chaos starts the previous phase will
[00:57:31] still be available the same is also true
[00:57:35] of pure fiction ero Trailblazers will
[00:57:38] have more time to plan their character
[00:57:40] leveling and to experience challenge
[00:57:43] gameplay you got it and I almost forgot
[00:57:46] about another significant new feature in
[00:57:48] version
[00:57:49] 1.6 get ready for the Forgotten Hall
[00:57:53] Auto clear this is so the6 update
[00:57:56] Trailblazers can directly challenge the
[00:57:59] highest memory of chaos stage they
[00:58:00] previously cleared with three stars upon
[00:58:03] achieving a three star Victory they
[00:58:05] instantly receive all rewards from the
[00:58:08] so [ __ ] sick it saves so much time
[00:58:10] heads up that stage seven is currently
[00:58:13] the highest stage that Trailblazers can
[00:58:15] start their challenge well in other
[00:58:17] words as long as I've achieved a three
[00:58:20] star victory in stage seven and I attain
[00:58:22] the same victory in any given forgotten
[00:58:24] Hall memory dude that's so oh my God man
[00:58:28] stages precisely another Trailblazer
[00:58:31] timesaver it would seem that's not all
[00:58:34] the 1.6 update will further improve the
[00:58:37] user friendliness of the team set up in
[00:58:39] the Forgotten Hall as Trailblazers
[00:58:42] progress through stages and forgotten
[00:58:43] Hall memory of chaos the team set up
[00:58:46] from the previous stage will be carried
[00:58:48] over by default plus with the new team
[00:58:50] setup switching and one click clear
[00:58:53] functions lineup can be adjust Ed at the
[00:58:55] drop of a hat impressive it seems that
[00:58:58] optimizing Trailblazer experience is a
[00:59:00] firm priority why can't we switch I'm
[00:59:03] actually getting upset guess what else
[00:59:05] version 1.6 will also ease the
[00:59:07] completion difficulty of daily training
[00:59:09] allowing Trailblazers TOS with less
[00:59:12] effort additionally we've introduced a
[00:59:14] Tim limited unlock feature for certain
[00:59:17] material stages this might require
[00:59:20] further explanation simply put even if
[00:59:23] Trail bases have't explor the latest
[00:59:25] Maps they can still challenge certain
[00:59:27] material stages to gather leveling
[00:59:29] materials for their characters cool and

[01:17:15] over [ __ ] I might have
[01:17:22] to
[01:17:24] I need to decide what I'm doing with
[01:17:25] starl because I really like playing the
[01:17:27] game but I don't know if I want to make
[01:17:29] gu like if I want to make full guides
[01:17:31] for it or not yet I haven't decided I've
[01:17:33] made some and like people have liked
[01:17:34] them I just don't
[01:17:36] know the only thing I don't like about
[01:17:38] it is like the how every team has like
[01:17:42] eight different rotations based on your
[01:17:44] speed which I think is kind of cringe
[01:17:46] but other than that it's pretty
[01:17:48] cool we'll see just guys when you like a
[01:17:50] character yeah I might do that and then
[01:17:52] just second Channel like normal videos
[01:17:54] for the
[01:18:03] rest huh holy
[01:18:08] [ __ ] it's Hoy
[01:18:12] over I mean yeah if not for the
[01:18:14] characters I didn't I made a second
[01:18:15] child video explaining it which was fine
[01:18:17] but I don't know anyways let me let me
[01:18:20] this ban is cracked by the way I mean
[01:18:21] March is March but she's cute so is what
[01:18:23] it is uh and then Ting Yun and [ __ ]
[01:18:26] new character that's pretty POG flot
[01:18:28] triptic and a lost soul and you're
[01:18:31] getting the next half's character for
[01:18:32] free so unless you want
[01:18:36] Kafka TR bases can obtain the limit so
[01:18:39] this is going to be the banner to go for
[01:18:41] probably and she's Harmony so unless
[01:18:43] she's complete dog [ __ ] she's probably
[01:18:44] going to be very flexible and really
[01:18:45] good but we don't I mean it's it's
[01:18:47] weakness break efficiency which is nice
[01:18:49] but we'd have to see if she's actually
[01:18:51] good or not the character will be
[01:18:54] joining version 1.6 is first phase
[01:18:56] character warp oh it's bandage guys
[01:18:59] black SW is harmony yeah I love blackx
[01:19:01] one during the second phase of version
[01:19:03] the only thing I don't like about
[01:19:05] Quantum Harmony this is get going to get
[01:19:06] me a lot of hate okay the only thing I
[01:19:08] don't like about Quantum Harmony is the
[01:19:10] people that were saying to play mono
[01:19:11] Quantum in like 1.1 with silver for like
[01:19:13] I am mono
[01:19:15] Quantum dude you can play different
[01:19:17] [ __ ] elements bro it's not hard to
[01:19:19] Silver W Force an implant if you're if
[01:19:22] you just pick a charact
[01:19:23] of whatever path the enem is weak to
[01:19:25] it's not that hard whatever element
[01:19:27] they're weak to you just put in your
[01:19:29] it's fine I'm going to calm
[01:19:31] down black black SW is Win to Hil wait
[01:19:33] who's the Healer that's Quantum is that
[01:19:36] spa or not uh sorry Harmony not healer
[01:19:39] is that sparkle who is it I don't know
[01:19:40] someone's Quantum I don't know who it is
[01:19:42] I just saw it is Sparkle okay my bad I
[01:19:44] mixed them yeah the healer's links and
[01:19:46] the harmony is Sparkle Sparkle looks
[01:19:49] cool
[01:19:51] though
[01:19:54] silver wolf Mains when no Quantum
[01:19:57] dude silver Wolf's always good or like
[01:20:00] at least fine that was
[01:20:04] good but mono it seems like it's going
[01:20:07] to work so that's good I mean it already
[01:20:08] does but
[01:20:11] yeah almost forgot about another
[01:20:13] significant new feature in version It's
[01:20:15] just our Twitter ready for the Forgotten
[01:20:18] Hall aut Commander after the 1.6 update
[01:20:23] Trailblazers can directly challenge the
[01:20:25] highest memory of chaos stage they
[01:20:27] previously cleared with three stars upon
[01:20:29] achieving a three star
[01:20:31] Victory reive all rewards from the
[01:20:34] preceding stages stands up that stage
[01:20:38] currently the highest stage that
[01:20:40] Trailblazers can start their challenge
[01:20:43] well in other words long as I've
[01:20:45] achieved a three star victory in stage
[01:20:47] seven and I attain the same victory in
[01:20:49] any given forgotten Hall memory of chaos
[01:20:51] update I can get my hands on rewards for
[01:20:53] the previous six stages precisely
[01:20:57] another timesaver it would seem that's
[01:21:00] not all the 1.6 update will further
[01:21:03] improve the user friendliness of the
[01:21:05] team set up in the Forgotten Hall as
[01:21:07] Trailblazers progress through stages and
[01:21:09] forgotten Hall memory of chaos the team
[01:21:12] set up from the previous stage will be
[01:21:14] carried over by Def I'm actually afraid
[01:21:15] to open rep on new team setup switching
[01:21:18] and one click clear functions lineups
[01:21:20] can be adjusted at the drop of a hat

[01:27:26] golden gears [ __ ] a pomed a simulated
[01:27:29] news and Frozen SpaceTime just before
[01:27:32] the demise of member 27 Emperor rubert
[01:27:37] Emperor rubert was a computer became
[01:27:39] self-aware and subsequently Drew no's

[01:27:55] watch the same dude I'm processing what
[01:27:58] just happened listen if for the listen
[01:28:01] listen I just if for the past three
[01:28:04] years I've been getting like one or two
[01:28:06] three cool things at a time getting like
[01:28:08] six at a time it's a lot to digest okay
[01:28:11] I'm trying to like I'm trying to go
[01:28:12] through it all okay sometimes we get
[01:28:14] that inchin when they drop the fatou
[01:28:16] trailer when they dropped the [ __ ]
[01:28:18] like a new region or like a Hu like you
[01:28:21] know but this is like this is different
[01:28:23] cuz like start like anniversary so it
[01:28:25] obviously cuz if cuz you know free so
[01:28:27] it's like more to you know more to
[01:28:29] digest IPC not rest at
[01:28:35] the yeah the self modeling resin is
[01:28:38] actually huge but I don't know if it's
[01:28:39] like a weekly shop if it's a onetime
[01:28:41] thing or if it's they didn't show the
[01:28:42] shop which is sad but they said you get
[01:28:44] currency that you can spend at that shop
[01:28:46] so I assume it's resetting but if it's a
[01:28:49] onetime thing then I mean it's still
[01:28:50] cool but
[01:29:03] yeah the weekend right that's two full
[01:29:07] days oful Universe testing Trailblazers
[01:29:10] you know what to
[01:29:12] do I'm not talking about the weekend
[01:29:16] y'all I'm talking about they're adding
[01:29:18] the weekend in starl that's crazy that's
[01:29:21] a crazy collab that's a crazy
[01:29:32] collab well
[01:29:37] anyways and Sunday true wait this is too

[01:29:46] chill too little your end approaches
[01:29:50] receive divinity

[01:29:58] me I'm still in shock yeah me
[01:30:02] too
[01:30:04] the orain genin buried no I mean genin's
[01:30:08] genin's always going to be lit cuz you
[01:30:10] can like it's more like you feel the
[01:30:12] characters
[01:30:13] more cuz it's like it's like it's not
[01:30:16] Auto Battle so there's more like
[01:30:19] attachment to the characters but STL has
[01:30:22] way better like way better quality of
[01:30:25] life like way better it's like not even
[01:30:27] close it's actually not even close like
[01:30:29] STL got the Expedition Auto redeploy
[01:30:31] after 3
[01:30:33] years but what like I think like I think
[01:30:36] if you're a genon player you need you
[01:30:38] need to okay here's the like here's the
[01:30:40] the cope process of a gen player you
[01:30:42] need as a gen player you need to Hope
[01:30:44] starel gets a good patch and then you
[01:30:46] have to wait a year and then we get it
[01:30:48] too I
[01:30:49] think orain
[01:30:53] hey maybe we'll get floor
[01:31:07] 15 I shall be the
[01:31:12] charger

[01:32:44] the I can do you can do the fun part
[01:32:47] focusing and then the rest you can just

[01:32:54] I have other things to
[01:33:02] do what is that Team bro LOL listen here
[01:33:06] [ __ ] I'm just Auto battling with
[01:33:08] characters that I like also as far as
[01:33:10] playing characters that I like go haa
[01:33:12] can actually be efficient to buffing
[01:33:14] both even though her skill points don't
[01:33:16] actually do that much because she can
[01:33:17] use her alt on the attacks I just Auto
[01:33:19] attacked on blade she can use her alt on
[01:33:21] the attack killing character and then
[01:33:22] increase the damage that the enemy takes
[01:33:24] from both of the the the dudes on my
[01:33:26] team so it's actually kind of
[01:33:32] synergistic oh that's
[01:33:40] cool a little toxic this I'm
[01:33:44] not being toxic why is the fourar flower
[01:33:49] better I don't know

[01:34:09] one thing I wish I could
[01:34:11] do let me
[01:34:19] jump why I use AR I was but I changed
[01:34:22] cuz I I did dude I I usually Auto Battle
