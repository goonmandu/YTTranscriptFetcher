[00:09:45] usual cuz I have a headache well I I was
[00:09:46] fine that I did a raid with a Jeff and
[00:09:48] then I got a headache through it now I'm
[00:09:50] I so I took a bit before streaming
[00:09:51] that's why we're late it's [ __ ] 2:30
[00:09:53] a.m. all good but now I'm a bit better
[00:09:55] be here forever still have a little
[00:09:57] headache though so uh
[00:10:00] um yeah we'll see uh I wanted to do this
[00:10:04] today but I think we'll do it tomorrow
[00:10:06] which was doing a 100 uid reviews I did
[00:10:08] that in the past if you guys remember I
[00:10:10] did two streams where I did 50 account
[00:10:11] reviews on each uid reviews you guys
[00:10:14] submitted it was fun I was going to make
[00:10:16] it into a video but then it got [ __ ]
[00:10:19] somewhere in the editing process all
[00:10:20] good it is what it is so I'm doing it
[00:10:22] again and this one's going to be updated
[00:10:25] with maybe finina no it'll be before
[00:10:27] finina maybe we'll do half before she's
[00:10:28] out half when she's out I don't know but
[00:10:31] basically if you guys didn't see I
[00:10:32] opened editor apps I tweeted this right
[00:10:34] before I streamed so I'm looking for
[00:10:37] another Editor to help with uh stuff
[00:10:38] like this uh it is Shang Ling's
[00:10:44] birthday so yeah
[00:10:48] um anyways so we're going to do 100 uid
[00:10:51] reviews probably next stream we'll do 50
[00:10:53] and then the stream after we'll do
[00:10:54] another 50 however next stream I also
[00:10:56] wanted to do the the gene outfit archon
[00:10:58] Quest so I don't know I have a lot to do
[00:11:00] this week we're going to do the archon
[00:11:01] quest before fina's out in jean costume
[00:11:04] we're going to do uh uh 100 uid reviews
[00:11:06] we're going to do the full account
[00:11:08] fixing I still haven't really picked an
[00:11:10] account I kind of picked one so I might
[00:11:11] go with that one but they don't seem
[00:11:14] very enthusiastic about it maybe they
[00:11:16] are maybe they are I don't know we'll
[00:11:18] see uh and then also what else is I
[00:11:21] going to
[00:11:22] do I don't know some other stuff did you
[00:11:25] write that editor thing in Discord no it
[00:11:26] SS sticky notes and then I change it to
[00:11:27] Black it's scuffed but the thing is I
[00:11:30] don't want to get like a professional
[00:11:31] editor who's never played genin in his
[00:11:33] life and who was like like [ __ ] like
[00:11:35] I don't know I'm scuffed so I need
[00:11:37] someone who's like also SC like I need
[00:11:39] the editing to like they have to
[00:11:40] understand me so if this is too scuffed
[00:11:42] for the editor then I don't want them
[00:11:44] does that make sense that makes sense
[00:11:45] it's it's that makes
[00:11:46] sense
[00:11:48] anyways
[00:11:52] um mods if there's any Discord mods here
[00:11:55] you guys could lowkey reopen the account
[00:11:58] fixing for for in Discord cuz I kind of
[00:12:00] have one but I'm also open to other ones
[00:12:05] however oh also for the you know how I
[00:12:08] said for it's been like a year that
[00:12:09] we've done since we've done a whale
[00:12:10] account review and those usually do
[00:12:13] well I'm going to open I was going to
[00:12:16] open whale C forms but I think the
[00:12:18] better idea is what if we just reviewed
[00:12:20] okay you know last time we did Razer
[00:12:21] Ninja's account and he he was like a
[00:12:23] turbo whale right
[00:12:26] um how do you open your channel they
[00:12:29] move the [ __ ]
[00:12:31] layout
[00:12:33] um where is it here this one right huge
[00:12:37] [ __ ] whale account review right
[00:12:40] uh I was thinking I was like I could
[00:12:42] just ask my community who has accounts
[00:12:43] like this and I will so if you guys do
[00:12:45] stay tuned but and we also do you know
[00:12:47] freeo play reviews but anyways I was
[00:12:49] thinking I was like dude no average lock
[00:12:51] TR is going to look like that so I
[00:12:52] thought for a I thought I thought I was
[00:12:54] like guess what happened I was like wait
[00:12:56] a second what if I DM ten so I DM tenha
[00:12:59] I was like yo do you want to do account
[00:13:01] review after Fin's out he said yes so we
[00:13:05] might review Ten's account
[00:13:08] um so expect maybe that

[02:02:33] where there's like the dude like okay no
[02:02:36] spoilers but like the big dude was like
[02:02:37] jet I chose what I chose and then we
[02:02:39] like fought and
[02:02:47] then cuz I remember I did that whole
[02:02:50] story line while watching transa man

[02:02:52] doing it's like I remember what I'm
[02:02:55] doing I remember I okay I okay I okay
[02:02:59] when I okay my memories when I remember
[02:03:02] something I remember like the moment and
[02:03:05] like what okay how do I do this I
[02:03:08] associate certain things with certain
[02:03:10] other things so then when I remember one
[02:03:12] I remember the other for example certain
[02:03:14] conversations I have I like there's like
[02:03:16] like a pretty important like like like
[02:03:20] like work meeting where I was in a zoom
[02:03:22] call like a Microsoft teams call but I
[02:03:24] was also fidgeting my weapon in the
[02:03:26] valerant range and I remember being in
[02:03:28] the range during the conversation and
[02:03:30] it's the same with some genin quests
[02:03:31] like I remember like sometimes I'll
[02:03:33] explore like an area in genin like for
[02:03:34] example like like this part is like I
[02:03:37] don't know what's an area that I 100%
[02:03:41] did I don't know well like here I
[02:03:43] remember watching chainsaw man while I

[02:08:01] the abyss but I have to un C by resin
[02:08:02] first should we do this thing the new
[02:08:04] Min of
[02:08:06] sin
[02:08:16] sure hello Mr lover expert do you use
[02:08:19] hydro goblet on onfield kakomi I do
[02:08:30] yes that's a French word yeah but why
[02:08:33] would I change my language mids sentence
[02:08:36] the Numa of
[02:08:39] sin okay this my team got a side job for
[02:08:44] me I'm a big uh I'm a big not fan I'm a
[02:08:49] small fan I'm a big denier I'm a I'm a
[02:08:53] big not fan of going for more healing
[02:08:57] unless you need more healing that
[02:08:59] sounded stupid like for characters that
[02:09:02] like for any healer I usually go the
[02:09:05] other offensive stat than the healing
[02:09:06] stat does that make sense that makes
[02:09:11] sense like Bennett I'll stack ER Ki I
[02:09:14] mean Ki is kind of different but like
[02:09:17] like okay [ __ ] you I don't even want to
[02:09:19] explain
[02:09:32] anymore I noticed you didn't mention Doo
[02:09:34] on rizzly video does not work for him uh
[02:09:36] the current free playay options just
[02:09:37] better uh Doo is charge attack right
[02:09:40] yeah that's why for
[02:09:41] C1
[02:09:43] sure but I'm pretty sure it would still
[02:09:46] be worth that dude this weapon listen
[02:09:47] Floy impurity gives you like 40% at R5
[02:09:50] is it 40 Elemental damage bonus it's so
[02:09:53] good dude it's so
[02:09:55] good Doo tails is pretty good on certain
[02:09:58] characters but you need to be charge
[02:10:00] attacking uh c0 I wouldn't recommend
[02:10:04] it C1 sure but like dude Floy p is so
[02:10:10] good also ballad is

[02:10:52] this domain for so long I miss
[02:10:55] Vermillion find playing rizzly fun yes I
[02:10:57] think he'll be more fun once I activate
[02:10:59] my C1 but I do think he's
[02:11:07] fun
[02:11:10] sorry I actually need to go back to Reon

[02:12:15] Sanctified settle down
[02:12:19] not oversight on my
[02:12:25] part n that is so sick how is this
[02:12:27] character even real dude how do you
[02:12:29] summon a giant hydrock like what the
[02:12:31] [ __ ] even is
[02:12:46] this B on new HSR characters
[02:12:50] ratio doctor ratio looks
[02:12:53] funny they actually all look cool all
[02:12:55] three of them look
[02:13:03] cool so I'm very excited dude I have
[02:13:06] [ __ ] 43 Crystal cores I'm actually a
[02:13:09] Chad the new [ __ ] the new spot that
[02:13:11] gives six is so good I love
[02:13:16] it
[02:13:21] that's it I will literally find you and
[02:13:24] kiss you in game what do you mean that's
[02:13:27] it do you know how many I
[02:13:29] spent sorry you don't use your resin
[02:13:32] like I
[02:13:46] do still capped
[02:13:49] resin we're also going to refresh so
[02:13:58] yeah what if we do a thing where every
[02:14:00] time we die every time every Temple we
[02:14:03] do that's not the new character we
[02:14:04] delete Crystal
[02:14:16] flies the mighty
[02:14:27] cont into the wind let's
[02:14:32] begin
[02:14:41] [ __ ] dude this is so boring I need I
[02:14:43] need a team call that's not
[02:14:46] boring
[02:14:48] that's too good P we're going to do
[02:14:51] Abyss soon though so it's fine dude I
[02:14:52] was thinking what if we did Abyss chat
[02:14:54] what if we did Abyss chat chat rate this
[02:14:57] idea out of 10 okay and don't type zero
[02:14:59] wait okay you're not allowed to rate it
[02:15:01] yet you're not allowed to rate it I'm
[02:15:02] not explaining stop stop okay what if we
[02:15:05] did the abyss but we had to clear it
[02:15:07] with every character and we're not
[02:15:10] allowed to reuse characters what this
[02:15:12] means is once we use one like let's say
[02:15:14] you make two teams of four then you
[02:15:16] can't use those eight anymore and you
[02:15:17] have to you do teams before and then we
[02:15:19] have to do with every single
[02:15:25] character is that a banger idea and then
[02:15:27] we can title it like I did the abyss
[02:15:29] with I beating gench impact with every
[02:15:31] character boom now I already trademarked
[02:15:33] this idea so even if I do it in three
[02:15:36] gear you'll know that it was my idea
[02:15:40] true I'm glazing but that's a banger
[02:15:45] true someone is talking about what what
[02:15:47] if you did floors 1 to 12 but each floor
[02:15:51] like you can't reuse characters and like
[02:15:53] that looked interesting but I feel like
[02:15:54] it'd be better if we just did 12 a
[02:15:56] million
[02:16:01] times that be a banger series okay
[02:16:03] honestly I'd probably make it to one
[02:16:05] video I don't really do
[02:16:09] series but I feel like that would take
[02:16:11] so long what if I did chat what if I did
[02:16:13] we're also not allowed to change
[02:16:14] artifacts on anyone so I need everyone
[02:16:16] to be geared before I start but I I have
[02:16:17] enough weapons so it have to be
[02:16:18] artifacts only would that even be
[02:16:25] possible dude my Noel's level
[02:16:39] 40 that'd be
[02:16:46] funny
[02:16:50] you can Chuck three bad characters with
[02:16:51] nevet wa true we could do we could do
[02:16:55] nevet with like Noel Amber and like Quil
[02:16:59] would I not like shenan I mean shenan
[02:17:01] can play in monop
[02:17:02] pyro Amber could be used with
[02:17:05] Hut
[02:17:08] the yeah nevet nevet can carry three
[02:17:11] characters I don't want to play and then
[02:17:13] Shia farzon can carry like any terrible
[02:17:17] character and then just a Healer that
[02:17:18] like isn't that good like [ __ ] I
[02:17:20] don't know Dory or
[02:17:23] something the side effect taking a turn
[02:17:26] for the
[02:17:28] better but I don't know if I want to
[02:17:29] waste farizon there farzon might be in
[02:17:31] like a hazo like something team
[02:17:41] yeah balls xia is
[02:17:44] small xia is not
[02:17:46] small
[02:17:48] why would you say
[02:17:50] that oh thrilling Tales tzo wait never
[02:17:52] mind yeah thrilling Tales veress vener
[02:17:54] tzo you're
[02:17:57] right wait does mine actually be doable
[02:18:00] I actually want to wait let me
[02:18:05] cook This is actually wait a second this
[02:18:07] would be hard but I think it'd be
[02:18:13] doable we can make an electro team with
[02:18:16] Sara M could be in some like weird like
[02:18:19] he could be with rizzly
[02:18:24] actually Chong yeah like some of these
[02:18:27] characters are kind of
[02:18:31] weird Candace could be with nuu but we
[02:18:34] can only make one nuu team so it' be
[02:18:36] hard we'd have to use nuu Candice and
[02:18:38] then yao yao but then we lose one dendro
[02:18:41] like we can't use too many dendros at
[02:18:42] the same time cuz dendro is
[02:18:44] broken Leila's fine as a flex C can
[02:18:47] thrilling Tales amember can elegy yen is
[02:18:50] fine Noel is useless but we can put her
[02:18:53] on crystal like Petra uh Petra kle is
[02:18:56] fine with like kaching Dory is just a
[02:18:59] Healer that's okay Razer kind of like we
[02:19:01] could hyper blo but he kind of sucks I
[02:19:03] mean unless C6 benett SAR would be fine
[02:19:05] with Electro Goro can be a mono Geo
[02:19:08] mono's
[02:19:09] fine
[02:19:11] aloy GG I
[02:19:16] mean
[02:19:19] how many characters are there this is
[02:19:21] five per Row 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 11
[02:19:27] 12 13 14 *
[02:19:31] 5 5 * 12 is 60 + 10 so 70 1 2
[02:19:43] 3 that's not even divisible by
[02:19:46] four
[02:19:59] dude that's
[02:20:00] monka okay wait so what if we do okay
[02:20:03] let's say we do it's 73 right divide
[02:20:04] that by four we could do 18 full
[02:20:07] teams does this mean we just don't use
[02:20:09] one character or do we like fill are we
[02:20:12] allowed to reuse some characters two
[02:20:14] characters next p oh
[02:20:16] true
[02:20:18] so 75 divide that by four almost
[02:20:25] 19 but it's divided by eight right cuz
[02:20:29] you we need two
[02:20:31] teams so we could do nine runs or we'd
[02:20:34] have to like add reuse some
[02:20:38] characters don't use aloy 72 thisis by
[02:20:42] eight it is wait I knew that why didn't
[02:20:44] I know
[02:20:46] that
[02:20:49] I mean realistically we wait for finina
[02:20:51] for this though realistically I'm not
[02:20:53] going to do this today so we should
[02:20:54] probably wait for finina like because by
[02:20:57] the time the video is out if there's no
[02:20:58] finina people will be weird cuz it's a
[02:21:00] [ __ ] archon so we should probably
[02:21:01] wait for
[02:21:02] finina and then we would just like oh
[02:21:06] there's multiple Travelers
[02:21:09] true
[02:21:11] true no way we're using every traveler
[02:21:15] right okay let's say two new characters
[02:21:18] so 75 then let's say three more
[02:21:23] Travelers that's I mean 80 is the
[02:21:30] visible oh no five Travelers cuz there's
[02:21:32] Hydro Electro uh dendro
[02:21:36] Geo Animo so it' be
[02:21:39] 79 it' be
[02:21:43] 79 there's no Hydro true actually Hydro
[02:21:57] is using traveler five times is kind of
[02:22:00] cringe
[02:22:03] though but dendro is good and Electro is
[02:22:06] fine Animo is okay as well with VV Geo
[02:22:08] could be good in a Geo team but how many
[02:22:10] Geo teams can we make because the Geo
[02:22:11] characters aren't really good alone well
[02:22:13] albo and we can make one Geo team like
[02:22:15] Ito Goro
[02:22:18] yunen can be used Flex jongi can Flex
[02:22:20] albo can Flex ning Wang kind of can't
[02:22:24] we'd probably do Ito
[02:22:32] Goro and like albo maybe and
[02:22:37] then could also ning Wong on that team
[02:22:39] but
[02:22:44] yeah I'm sure EO Goro I'll B would be
[02:22:48] fine and then we could do ning Wong with
[02:22:49] like either un thrilling tals or
[02:22:52] actually like a carry should be
[02:22:54] fine you're Bing Noel yeah Noel is going
[02:22:56] in the get carried by nevet
[02:23:07] team well dude cryo is
[02:23:09] rough cryo is such a weird element
[02:23:12] there's such good characters and there
[02:23:13] such mediocre ones like Kaa Rosaria C
[02:23:17] shha AA sure we're going to play a
[02:23:19] physical team which is cringe but
[02:23:21] whatever and then G is going to need
[02:23:23] high value supports but sure and then f
[02:23:25] is going to just be hyper Bloom then
[02:23:27] it's like [ __ ] aloy Chong Yun others
[02:23:31] are fine I
[02:23:34] guess don't call G mid dude all of our
[02:23:37] teams need characters that other
[02:23:38] characters other teams
[02:23:40] need every time you die you spin the
[02:23:44] wheel what wheel maybe we just T bu
[02:23:47] every time we
[02:23:55] die G actually ganu burst support would
[02:23:58] be fine no no no G I'm not even kidding
[02:24:00] G support would be good cuz using her as
[02:24:03] a DPS needs really high value supports
[02:24:05] usually but if we played her with like
[02:24:07] stringless or fav or
[02:24:09] elegy like we I don't know if we can
[02:24:11] swap our weapons every time or not I
[02:24:13] don't know what we're going to do but
[02:24:14] even using her on like stringless or
[02:24:16] like El
[02:24:17] get a lot of
[02:24:19] value we could probably use it with veny
[02:24:21] too actually cuz venti we don't need
[02:24:24] that
[02:24:32] much TR and quick sw's pretty fun TR and
[02:24:35] quick swop is fine it's not like the
[02:24:37] best but
[02:24:41] whatever
[02:24:45] silence
[02:24:50] every time I die I leak one digit of my
[02:24:53] credit
[02:25:14] card we we do the sniper with W
[02:25:17] challenge every time we die we dock a
[02:25:20] viewer I would do that I do no but the
[02:25:24] first idea is good
[02:25:34] though
[02:25:39] allegedly the mighty be
[02:25:44] humble how do you have our info I have
[02:25:47] everyone's

[02:28:01] back let's
[02:28:06] go this domain is like my
[02:28:12] home hello Mr ruin
[02:28:14] grater the wi
[02:28:18] I missed you
[02:28:26] friend wait nevet stuns this guy wait
[02:28:29] that's actually broken what the [ __ ]
[02:28:32] dude Net's made for
[02:28:35] Vermilion Shame on You Nero thanks for
[02:28:38] the 12
[02:28:41] months
[02:28:43] boom this could be good hey hey that
[02:28:46] could be be good it could
[02:28:54] be well we got a perfect
[02:29:00] feather one
[02:29:07] more one more one more one
[02:29:15] more
[02:29:17] face
[02:29:18] your dude we can still strong box
[02:29:21] Vermillion it's fine we're going to
[02:29:22] strong box it stifi so there's no point
[02:29:24] for me to be in the domain but like just
[02:29:26] a little like what if the luck what if
[02:29:28] okay I have a theory okay I have a
[02:29:30] theory what if all the bad luck is in
[02:29:34] the like everyone's strong boxing
[02:29:35] Vermillion so all the strong like the
[02:29:37] bad pieces go there and the good
[02:29:39] Vermillion pieces stay in the domain cuz
[02:29:42] no one's here to farm it I'll drink to
[02:29:45] that
[02:29:48] hey crit damage could be good let me
[02:29:54] cook no good for Star this could be
[02:30:04] good one more one
[02:30:09] more think rationally why are you here
[02:30:13] rational team is uh shanglin Bennett
[02:30:17] Ryden Shogun and Singo or like Yan right
[02:30:20] uh personally uh while that team is
[02:30:22] really good you know you can go Crimson
[02:30:23] Witch of flame strangling you can proc a
[02:30:25] lot of reactions you can get a lot of
[02:30:27] energy back it's pretty easy to play
[02:30:29] because you get so much energy it's
[02:30:30] pretty forgiving Unforgiven I'm a
[02:30:32] villain personally I like International
[02:30:34] more because it's like you can get a lot
[02:30:36] of AOE uh you can like kind of burst
[02:30:38] stuff with child it's pretty satisfying
[02:30:40] it's my personal favorite so no I'm not
[02:30:42] going to think rationally I'm going to
[02:30:44] think internationally and because of
[02:30:46] that I think
[02:30:51] Vermillion okay I remember why I quit
[02:30:53] this domain however this is good on
[02:30:55] Shena listen this could be good on Shena
[02:30:58] listen listen listen listen could this
[02:31:01] have been on this piece instead yes
[02:31:04] however it wasn't why because we're
[02:31:06] doing Vermillion and that's just how it
[02:31:08] goes here hey that's just how it goes
[02:31:11] dude my Shena is actually cracked cuz of

[02:39:59] XD dude my shower is almost perfect man
[02:40:02] it's actually so close to being perfect
[02:40:03] you don't even understand you literally
[02:40:05] don't even understand you literally
[02:40:09] don't even get
[02:40:14] it
[02:40:21] 107 em
[02:40:23] M dude if my sha was Hut okay not even
[02:40:27] coping if I was Hut but like skill with
[02:40:29] attack he would actually be perfect cuz
[02:40:31] I effortlessly get 100 er uh em I
[02:40:40] mean
[02:40:44] dude
[02:40:48] mine is better dude stop acting like
[02:40:51] yours is
[02:41:13] better wait which one's wait I need more
[02:41:16] crit damage than crit rate right yeah
[02:41:18] [ __ ] I don't know what my best flower
[02:41:21] is it's probably one with
[02:41:24] ER 23 27 yeah it's probably this
[02:41:30] one I use the optimizer but it's it like
[02:41:34] depends on what I put in the optimizer
[02:41:36] like what it wants like how much ER I'm
[02:41:37] optimizing for cuz I don't really need
[02:41:40] like I technically don't need ER in my
[02:41:42] sh cuz he see at least see1 like he see
[02:41:45] six but like even if I don't use it he's
[02:41:46] at least see1 I'm usually running a fav
[02:41:48] farzon and fav J Lee or like fav Toma
[02:41:52] and Bennett or like something like that
[02:41:54] so like I rarely need that much ER on
[02:41:56] him even without C6 cuz i e three times
[02:41:59] and I have like another battery on the
[02:42:00] team so it's usually
[02:42:02] fine but yeah I don't
[02:42:05] know but then if I optimize for like
[02:42:07] aasha like it's easier to be like 120 ER
[02:42:10] cuz like those brackets are like easier
[02:42:12] for me so I don't know I don't know ah I
[02:42:15] don't know okay one more Vermilion run
[02:42:18] never hurt
[02:42:29] anyone but low ER sucks for like random
[02:42:32] Overworld stuff like here like if I
[02:42:33] don't have my burst it's going to be
[02:42:34] annoying right but it should be fun if I
[02:42:36] have far I don't have far
[02:42:41] sorry surely I get farone's burst right
[02:42:43] surely I get surely I
[02:42:58] [Applause]
[02:43:00] SC oh wait it's a new day Chad you think
[02:43:02] I got Cliffhanger okay on the day we get
[02:43:05] Cliffhanger if it's on stream I'll gift
[02:43:07] at least I'll give 10 Subs 10 Subs on
[02:43:09] the day that we get Cliffhanger if it's
[02:43:11] on stream if it's off stream
[02:43:13] raboso nope no Cliffhanger right un
[02:43:26] likey does Kaza do anything on that team
[02:43:29] okay the last thought in this team is
[02:43:30] flexible usually it's Toma or J C6 Toma
[02:43:33] or Jang Lee
[02:43:35] but Kaza is actually kind of cracked if
[02:43:37] you have a free kazwa but you go full
[02:43:39] crit you go full crit I'm not even
[02:43:41] trolling by the way you go full crit
[02:43:43] kazwa cuz you get buffed with C6 Faron
[02:43:45] or just normal far on and benett and
[02:43:47] then Kazo actually carries my Kazo is
[02:43:48] not on crit right now though so he's
[02:43:49] going to be kind of whatever but I mean
[02:43:51] you can still swirl and stuff what about
[02:43:54] Jean Jean's fine too you can like
[02:43:55] Sunfire
[02:43:59] Jean but like
[02:44:05] yeah evil
[02:44:07] conquering who has a free Kaza I mean a
[02:44:11] lot of the new like dendro teams why am
[02:44:13] I only punching oh I didn't fire was on
[02:44:14] Alt um all the new like dendro teams
[02:44:17] don't really need Kaza like hyper Bloom
[02:44:19] even Quicken like stuff like that yeah
[02:44:21] you can still use him as a flex so you
[02:44:22] don't need them as much although quick
[02:44:25] okay with quian I lied uh the spread
[02:44:28] wouldn't need kazwa but aggravate would
[02:44:30] but aggra can use suc whatever but
[02:44:33] yeah what about so shut the [ __ ] up
[02:44:38] never type a a Jeff team name in here
[02:44:43] again dude I'm not even kidding when I
[02:44:45] talk with Z Jeff I have to like every
[02:44:48] time
[02:44:49] like every time he says a team name I
[02:44:52] have to stop and think about what it
[02:45:01] means what the [ __ ] is
[02:45:05] so air fryer is burning but you play
[02:45:09] kazwa so you suck the burning enemies to
[02:45:10] you and then they fry you and you
[02:45:14] die
[02:45:22] well I didn't kind res
[02:45:35] in
[02:45:41] forign B Mari is
[02:45:44] wild
[02:45:50] uh do we need Equity yes we do let's go
[02:45:52] to
[02:45:54] equity let's
[02:46:07] doity do you finish battle pass oh yeah
[02:46:10] of course I finished battle pass weeks
[02:46:11] in advance of
[02:46:14] course
[02:46:19] of
[02:46:26] course can you explore monat please and
[02:46:31] they misspelled monat and please listen
[02:46:34] my monat 100 100 100 100 100 drag I mean
[02:46:38] that's not M but Dragon spot 100 hey yes
[02:46:42] sir until we explore monad at the end of
[02:46:44] the game after cona we're going to go
[02:46:46] back to monat and this part is going to
[02:46:48] unlock
[02:47:02] true is it worth buying the batt pass if
[02:47:05] I won't Max it uh Define worth on
[02:47:10] my okay let's say hypothetically you're
[02:47:13] a Betto man and you're using a craftable
[02:47:15] weapon and you're like level 40 on the
[02:47:17] battle pass and you're like you won't
[02:47:18] Max it but you get serpent spine then
[02:47:21] there's literally no better purchase
[02:47:22] however if you're going to spend money
[02:47:24] you know I would try to Max your battle
[02:47:25] pass but that's up to you if you're
[02:47:28] under level 30 I'd say
[02:47:30] no but like 30 is pretty cracked cuz you
[02:47:32] get a
[02:47:37] weapon buy something that will bring you
[02:47:39] happiness instead
[02:47:42] true true actually
[02:48:04] we need more battle pass levels I feel
[02:48:05] like I have nothing to do for 14 days
[02:48:07] yeah that's how I felt at the start too
[02:48:09] like what yeah I used to cuz Okay back
[02:48:11] when the battle pass first came out dude
[02:48:13] those who know no you just have to go
[02:48:15] and collect like [ __ ] 100 monat
[02:48:18] Specialties or some [ __ ] like like you'd
[02:48:19] have to literally collect Regional
[02:48:21] Specialties and like do all that [ __ ] I
[02:48:22] would do all of them and I'd be level 50
[02:48:24] and there' be like literally two to
[02:48:26] three weeks left and I'd be like well
[02:48:28] but now it's like I just do it passively
[02:48:30] cuz it's like I usually just max it
[02:48:31] without
[02:48:33] trying it would be cool what they do in
[02:48:35] Cookie Run
[02:48:36] Kingdom what they do in Cookie Run
[02:48:38] kingdom is every extra level gets
[02:48:40] converted to Gold like Mora so like
[02:48:42] that'd be cool cuz then it's like you
[02:48:44] don't feel forc to go past 50 but if you
[02:48:45] do Mora obviously there could be better
[02:48:48] rewards but you get me yo Ruby thanks
[02:48:50] for the ray G it Chad how are
[02:48:54] you I hope you are doing
[02:48:58] poggers the only CC that actually admits

[02:49:41] wishing so long that even my heart

[02:49:56] never leave for six I really hate a I
[02:49:59] need some
[02:50:02] help oh CH I just remembered dude look
[02:50:05] at look at this feather I actually
[02:50:06] forgot I got
[02:50:08] this to the stove
[02:50:10] goding all my life for the catch sh
[02:50:15] Paradise been fishing all my life for
[02:50:19] the cash Shing
[02:50:22] Paradise Fishing my life for the
[02:50:26] C
[02:50:28] Paradise Fishing all my life for the
[02:50:33] shise look at the situation they got me
[02:50:36] farming I can live a normal life I was
[02:50:38] raised by K so I got to use national
[02:50:41] teams now too much Theory crafting where
[02:50:44] is
[02:50:49] I have to upload a
[02:50:58] YouTu
[02:51:01] sorry shout out KOCO music
[02:51:04] though how's your golden
[02:51:07] troop
[02:51:09] uh we don't talk about my golden tro but
[02:51:12] my marage is good ad
[02:51:17] the H procs Bloom and Neu team Shia you
[02:51:20] want to do full em Shia and uh you want
[02:51:23] to be swirling the
[02:51:30] cores no usually you have a full em
[02:51:32] character so a lot most of the time
[02:51:34] it'll be like kakomi or Barbara with
[02:51:36] like Nita on field or something like
[02:51:38] that but it it depends sometimes it's
[02:51:40] like a dendro or it could be like
[02:51:42] Candace with ya Yao but usually it's
[02:51:45] like
[02:52:00] bar was the pity for standard and star
[02:52:03] rail I'm at 82
[02:52:05] well
[02:52:12] unlucky servant Spiner never left weapon
[02:52:14] battle pass
[02:52:16] um unless you plan on refining Net's
[02:52:19] weapon unironically you could just
[02:52:21] prototype Amber for him and then serent
[02:52:23] spine for your like beta or something
[02:52:24] like if you use a Claymore character
[02:52:26] serent spine is a huge upgrade usually
[02:52:28] depending on your other options so I
[02:52:29] would do that but if like your your
[02:52:31] Clore character you don't care that much
[02:52:32] about then get the Jade Jade's pretty
[02:52:35] cracked but I really like protype Ember
[02:52:38] so a bigger P to swallow remember he
[02:52:42] comes settle down
[02:52:46] but if you plan on like ring sack Jade
[02:52:49] it becomes really cracked so uh that's
[02:52:51] up to
[02:52:59] you never let because Claymore
[02:53:01] characters are mid a lot of them are but
[02:53:03] then there's
[02:53:11] bet dude I wanted to make a video
[02:53:14] like I made an underrated character
[02:53:16] video like two years ago and then I made
[02:53:18] another one a year ago now or like a bit
[02:53:20] more than that I want to make another
[02:53:22] one but based on the the the characters
[02:53:24] that nobody uses in usage rate dude I
[02:53:26] saw dude okay do you guys see dude it's
[02:53:30] so
[02:53:31] bad dude okay I've already talked about
[02:53:34] Ka in my last one so I probably wouldn't
[02:53:35] talk about him again but Ka has like 0.1
[02:53:38] or like3 or
[02:53:43] something

[02:56:11] right
[02:56:13] now
[02:56:18] I saw someone write an essay now okay on
[02:56:21] PC it doesn't look that big but on
[02:56:22] mobile it was literally like I have to
[02:56:24] scroll four
[02:56:25] times I saw someone write an essay about
[02:56:28] how reminescence is better than Mari sh
[02:56:32] on rly at high investment so if you farm
[02:56:35] a lot and get good artifacts shavas is
[02:56:37] by far the best CH not just the viable
[02:56:39] option by far the best choice most of
[02:56:41] his damage comes from normal charge
[02:56:42] attack even more at1 so this 50% boost
[02:56:44] is just perfect from his ultimate is a
[02:56:45] nice addition but not crucial in
[02:56:46] rotation I would even say that you're
[02:56:48] losing on DPS if you cast Al in continue
[02:56:50] the normal attack bonus at C1 10c cool
[02:56:52] down for both his skill and the four
[02:56:54] effect so you always get 50 energy back
[02:56:55] even more actually when using his skill
[02:56:57] and attacking so you can basically
[02:56:58] always have the four P effect active
[02:57:00] everyone is praising the M said because
[02:57:01] it's easy the easy efficient option even
[02:57:03] at low investment sure you can only
[02:57:05] focus on crit damage without worrying
[02:57:06] about crit rate but you don't get
[02:57:07] anything aside from this wait you don't
[02:57:09] get anything aside from
[02:57:12] this hm 36 crit rate okay 50 normal
[02:57:17] attack damage okay 15 charge attack
[02:57:19] damage okay and 15 energy every rotation
[02:57:23] that you would be
[02:57:24] losing on reminescence okay don't get me
[02:57:28] started on the
[02:57:31] 50% there's still 35% damage difference
[02:57:33] with the sh four
[02:57:39] piece compare a shimwa 70220 and a m 40
[02:57:44] 280 Shima will do
[02:57:46] better okay listen I'm a big
[02:57:48] reminescence enjoyer I use reminescence
[02:57:50] on my Scara and I think Scar and rzz are
[02:57:52] like the same [ __ ] character like
[02:57:55] gameplay wise a lot the time listen
[02:57:58] let's say you get 35% more damage right
[02:58:00] 15% from the two piece ignoring the 18%
[02:58:02] attack from Essence gives you which is
[02:58:04] good but put that aside for now 35%
[02:58:07] damage difference right hm okay that's
[02:58:09] just two piece compared to the four
[02:58:10] piece okay interesting let's do a little
[02:58:13] bit of math really quickly now I'm not
[02:58:15] the best mathematician but 12 * 3 what
[02:58:18] is that 36 36 crit rate okay let's say
[02:58:21] you're critting all of your hits I know
[02:58:23] it won't be all of your hits but you're
[02:58:24] saying very high investment here right
[02:58:25] you're saying High investment so
[02:58:27] assuming 90% crit rate plus but let's
[02:58:29] say you crit all of them to make this
[02:58:30] easy for now 12 * 3 is 36 36 * 2 cuz
[02:58:35] crit rate to crit damage is 1 to two
[02:58:36] because that's how many stats you're
[02:58:38] saving right if you save 12 crit rate
[02:58:41] you're saving twice that which is 24
[02:58:44] crit damage so 12 * 3 36 right time 2 72
[02:58:49] you're saving 72 it's basically the
[02:58:51] equivalent of 72 crit damage right so
[02:58:55] 35% damage or
[02:58:59] 72 on
[02:59:03] everything now look you might not crit
[02:59:05] everything right let's say 60 50 that's
[02:59:08] still more now yeah you get attack on R
[02:59:12] Ence which is nice but cost energy so
[02:59:26] like Scrat I can't
[02:59:31] math it's just yeah well because okay so
[02:59:36] crit damage is the same as damage when
[02:59:38] you're critting right it's the same
[02:59:39] [ __ ] thing obviously it's
[02:59:42] like yeah like obviously it depends on
[02:59:44] your crit rate but when you when you
[02:59:46] [ __ ] deal damage it's crit damage
[02:59:47] crit damage is
[02:59:49] damage the only thing is you need to be
[02:59:52] critting but if you're high investment
[02:59:53] you're going to crit almost all of your
[02:59:54] hits especially with [ __ ] Mar CH and
[02:59:56] like Crow resonance and [ __ ] and then on
[02:59:58] top of that it's crit crit rate is
[03:00:00] basically crit damage cuz well it's the
[03:00:02] same thing crit rate and crit damage are
[03:00:03] the same [ __ ] thing except if you
[03:00:05] have crit rate it saves
[03:00:06] you no that's like saying crit is the
[03:00:08] same as attack are
[03:00:12] you
[03:00:20] okay
[03:00:22] listen listen crit rate and crit damage
[03:00:25] right they contribute to the same thing
[03:00:28] right crit rate and crit damage right
[03:00:31] it's the same it's two sides of the same
[03:00:32] coin you need crit rate to crit you need
[03:00:35] crit damage for your crits to deal
[03:00:36] damage okay every crit rate you get is
[03:00:38] the equivalent of two crit damage
[03:00:40] because that's how the stats work you
[03:00:41] don't believe me 62.2 two on the ciret
[03:00:44] for crit damage and then for crit rate
[03:00:46] it's 31.1 it's 1 to two same
[03:00:50] thing
[03:00:54] H so wouldn't that mean that having crit
[03:00:57] rate on your on your on your on your on
[03:00:59] your on your on your on your set is the
[03:01:01] same as having crit
[03:01:12] damage is it a separate multiplier
[03:01:15] you're multiplying
[03:01:24] it like okay let me let me let me
[03:01:28] clarify so I don't mislead someone it's
[03:01:30] not the same thing to have damage
[03:01:31] percent as it is to have crit damage
[03:01:34] it's not the exact same thing okay
[03:01:36] they're different but if this person is
[03:01:38] telling me that 35%
[03:01:42] damage is better than than
[03:01:45] 72% well not 72% well yeah 72% crit
[03:01:49] damage I will scream and shout and let
[03:01:52] it all
[03:01:53] out on top of losing 15
[03:01:57] energy and being harder to
[03:02:06] build what is this song you're a song
[03:02:10] Sorry song's
[03:02:12] good
[03:02:17] theor was let's
[03:02:27] begin damage good and damage
[03:02:30] bad
[03:02:33] wind High the bird's Cal one with
[03:02:41] nature yeah
[03:02:44] for 32% crit damage should be better
[03:02:45] than 70 for 32% damage be better than 70
[03:02:47] crit damage they would have to have a
[03:02:48] lot of crit damage and very little
[03:02:50] damage
[03:02:50] percent what if they're running an
[03:02:52] attack
[03:02:54] goblet and then they have a crit damage
[03:02:57] buffing they have the support they have
[03:02:59] bronia what if they're running Bron
[03:03:00] actually braia gives damage on your
[03:03:02] skill what if they have Bron Al and they
[03:03:03] get crit damage true
[03:03:11] actually they're eating crit
[03:03:35] food seems like an
[03:03:42] emergency
[03:03:44] a moment
[03:03:54] please but to be fair none of this ever
[03:03:56] matters because you go on sub stats and
[03:03:58] both they're fine and also a lot of your
[03:04:01] you know you might be running Shan who
[03:04:03] Buffs
[03:04:04] you and you might be running uh kazwa
[03:04:07] who does damage
[03:04:08] per well Elemental damage
[03:04:12] bonus
[03:04:14] so who
[03:04:15] knows smiley
[03:04:23] face wait this could be good what the
[03:04:42] [ __ ]
[03:04:46] also don't most of his weapons give
[03:04:49] damage
[03:04:51] percent this gives damage
[03:04:54] percent uh witth OB well whith is random
[03:04:58] this also gives damage
[03:05:02] percent I guess there's like what the
[03:05:05] [ __ ] would you run other than that it's
[03:05:06] like the only [ __ ] Grizzly
[03:05:10] weapon yeah will we get it no but I want
[03:05:13] to make sure I'm not wrong I'm not just
[03:05:15] trying to be right like I want to make
[03:05:17] sure I'm right if I'm wrong I'm wrong
[03:05:20] but
[03:05:37] no I'm going to make it to guide
[03:05:42] stop
[03:05:47] okay anyways I got St locked I'll keep
[03:05:48] going I'm sorry I'm
[03:05:51] sorry I
[03:05:53] apologize I'll leave the I'll leave
[03:05:55] those discussions to the
[03:05:57] Jeff I I'll let him I'll let him do that
[03:06:00] I'll let him pull up the
[03:06:02] XL cuz look I'm sure for like five
[03:06:05] people if you're [ __ ] 20 crit rate
[03:06:07] 342 crit damage yeah probably damage
[03:06:10] percent might be
[03:06:12] better
[03:06:14] a bitter P to swallow remember he comes
[03:06:17] and you're running
[03:06:24] BR can't wait for the I'm actually I'm
[03:06:26] actually excited for his Excel
[03:06:37] [Applause]
[03:06:42] stream
[03:06:46] yep
[03:06:51] [ __ ] makeing new gr name account and I
[03:06:54] that is zff Stream True wait but zff
[03:06:56] okay I don't know if his opinion changed
[03:06:58] because I don't I'm not here to speak
[03:06:59] for him but he I know he's a not a big
[03:07:02] fan of four reminescence cuz losing the
[03:07:04] energy not not like on any like in
[03:07:06] general cuz losing energy is not fun
[03:07:09] losing energy is not very
[03:07:12] fun
[03:07:22] your let the mighty be
[03:07:28] humble it for Scara yeah cuz I mean yeah
[03:07:31] cuz you're not going to farm [ __ ]
[03:07:32] okay cuz the thing with Scara is you're
[03:07:34] going to farm [ __ ] desert Pavilion
[03:07:36] that's literally like Vermilion but for
[03:07:38] losers okay [ __ ] it of course he's
[03:07:41] going to recommend shaas cuz that's more
[03:07:42] base but it's like Shan over Crimson
[03:07:45] witch on Hut or like fuel use to run on
[03:07:47] child or on [ __ ] like like on scar is
[03:07:49] fine but on like like like like like
[03:07:51] like like like like like who's another
[03:07:52] example who's another example of someone
[03:07:53] that
[03:07:54] like yeah it's like it's not bad but
[03:07:57] it's like it feels
[03:08:10] [ __ ] on child e dude you don't know how
[03:08:13] many questions I got about four
[03:08:15] reminescence on child you actually it
[03:08:17] was literally like bombarding like when
[03:08:19] it first came out for like literally
[03:08:21] like five
[03:08:24] patches it's like yes I love losing all
[03:08:26] my energy that is so
[03:08:29] great the time's
[03:08:37] Beck settle
[03:08:40] down I hacking love losing all my
[03:08:44] energy but I like it a lot on um on
[03:08:51] Scara changing for to for CRI on h no no
[03:08:55] it's fine like if you have a good
[03:08:57] reminescence use it that Mak sense like
[03:08:59] especially with like huta it's like okay
[03:09:02] with Hut Crimson Witch is better and
[03:09:03] it's like Crimson Witch is is nice you
[03:09:05] can strongbox it but like if you already
[03:09:07] have really good reminescence unless
[03:09:09] you're annoyed by how it works the main
[03:09:11] thing you lose out on is being able the
[03:09:13] panic button alt you usually still can
[03:09:14] burst it's fine and it's still good
[03:09:17] damage and it's better for your normals
[03:09:19] so like it's okay like my Hut build is
[03:09:22] better on reminescence I use Crimson
[03:09:24] witch cuz it's cool and I enjoy it more
[03:09:26] but my reminescence is technically
[03:09:27] better so like if your subsides are fine
[03:09:29] it's not worth rearming a you
[03:09:34] set but it depends on you like I don't
[03:09:37] mind using Chimas but if you do then you
[03:09:39] might want to
[03:09:41] farm the
[03:09:44] way
[03:09:45] now be
[03:09:47] Sanctified bow your
[03:09:53] head do I miss my
[03:10:10] e but
[03:10:11] yeah
[03:10:20] also dude no no way you literally just
[03:10:22] no way you don't burst on like
[03:10:26] okay yeah I don't
[03:10:29] know no way that guy wants to not burst
[03:10:32] on rizzly ever though right like surely
[03:10:34] every two rotations is actually
[03:10:36] worthwhile cuz you can also like get it
[03:10:38] buffed quite a
[03:10:41] bit
[03:10:43] I'm getting stun
[03:10:45] locked I'm actually stun locked let the
[03:10:48] mighty be
[03:10:55] humble a
[03:10:58] bit
[03:11:02] oops
[03:11:11] silence also if you're not see1 you have
[03:11:14] down don't you like you riz's e is not
[03:11:17] like you have downtime like obviously
[03:11:20] you can swap all your supports and [ __ ]
[03:11:21] but
[03:11:25] like okay we have to do a
[03:11:29] this burst in the middle of Elemental
[03:11:32] skill duration an inconvience okay this
[03:11:35] has to be a I'm getting one guide there
[03:11:37] is no way you are using [ __ ] 3
[03:11:41] seconds of your 10c damage state to
[03:11:43] burst there is no way there is literally
[03:11:46] no way that's like using Hut's burst in
[03:11:48] the middle there is no way you're doing
[03:11:52] that there's no there's actually no way
[03:11:54] there is actually no way you lose look
[03:11:57] look
[03:11:58] look on I'm attacking
[03:12:01] right I burst I just lost 3 seconds of
[03:12:11] DPS
[03:12:16] GG this
[03:12:22] time you're c0 with no
[03:12:26] healer oh I forgot rizzly players like
[03:12:29] that exist okay sure okay okay okay if
[03:12:34] you're a c0 charge attack no healer
[03:12:37] keepy my HP between 50 and 60% rizzly sh
[03:12:44] sure okay you do you okay don't even
[03:12:47] talk to me cuz you know what you're
[03:12:48] doing I don't I don't want to know okay
[03:12:51] sure if that's how you play them cuz
[03:12:53] sure you do you you do you and you have
[03:12:56] fun I am not educated enough to comment
[03:12:59] on that
[03:13:02] however that that
[03:13:11] why I need to level this Agony I need to
[03:13:15] level
[03:13:16] this well I actually
[03:13:20] can bro got one guide for an hour
[03:13:29] listen trying to make sure I'm not wrong
[03:13:32] someone's about to make a video essay on
[03:13:34] why reminescence is best in slot well
[03:13:37] actually if you have uh uh Bennett on
[03:13:39] your team giving you attack and then you
[03:13:41] invest in crit damage you have actually
[03:13:42] hit diminishing returns and then the
[03:13:44] energy drain is not that bad cuz you can
[03:13:46] build ER on your sub
[03:13:52] stats dude I'm actually so good at
[03:13:54] yapping I could Yap for both sides I
[03:13:57] could literally I could literally write
[03:13:58] the entire argument for both sides of
[03:14:10] anything on the Y
[03:14:29] Master the mayor of yappers
[03:14:41] Ville
[03:14:57] what is bro looking at I'm still getting
[03:14:59] one guide I'm trying to think of what
[03:15:01] rizzly teams I play because we're
[03:15:02] probably going to play them in this
[03:15:04] Abyss right what are we going to play
[03:15:05] Shena Bennett or do we play we probably
[03:15:07] don't play freeze
[03:15:09] right play maetta
[03:15:14] oh God what dude I'm thinking cuz sha
[03:15:17] also gives you dude cuz
[03:15:24] cuz should we level her can I send her I
[03:15:28] need dude we get a send her right now do
[03:15:30] we want as send her I'm actually down
[03:15:32] you think I'm you think you think I'm
[03:15:34] trolling I'm actually down what if we
[03:15:35] ascended her what if we want enia just
[03:15:37] came out but we explore some of
[03:15:40] it we have to do this boss Twi twice or
[03:15:43] three I don't know how many we needed
[03:15:45] for some reason I thought this was star
[03:15:46] Rail and we can get five boss mats how
[03:15:49] many do we need I thought it was five
[03:15:51] per Kill U the [ __ ] star rail ruined
[03:15:53] me oh God we need like you we need
[03:16:11] six
[03:16:13] wait what is every single buff Shan how
[03:16:14] gives again cuz the hold e gives you
[03:16:17] normal and charge attack where is that
[03:16:19] hold e is here right no it's here you
[03:16:22] get normal and charge attack damage and
[03:16:23] then here you get cryo damage and then
[03:16:25] here you get cryo red shred and then
[03:16:27] here you get attack right yeah so again
[03:16:30] if you're so if you're playing shime
[03:16:32] [ __ ] it I'm still St locked if you're
[03:16:34] playing shime you're either running
[03:16:35] freeze with CAO that gives you damage
[03:16:37] percent so okay diminishing returns
[03:16:39] there if you're G to make the argument
[03:16:40] that it's better than crit damage and
[03:16:41] then here you get damage percent here
[03:16:43] and damage percent here so there's
[03:16:45] another dimension
[03:16:49] returns
[03:16:52] okay never gives you attack yeah yeah
[03:16:54] sorry it's the [ __ ] it's the buff
[03:16:56] scaling on her attack actually she does
[03:16:57] cuz no BL oblig boom [ __ ] wrong one
[03:17:02] ratioed sorry but you know what I
[03:17:11] mean
[03:17:13] what if you have Shena C6 yeah what
[03:17:16] then what am I doing what the [ __ ] am I
[03:17:18] doing I'm swirling cryo [ __ ]
[03:17:24] it be
[03:17:27] Sanctified wait where is
[03:17:29] he wait which one did I not
[03:17:33] kill that
[03:17:36] one nice
[03:17:39] my where's his team
[03:17:41] friendship
[03:17:45] wait wait wait wait wait let me cook let
[03:17:48] me cook I know that doesn't look good
[03:17:49] but I know that doesn't look good but I
[03:17:51] know wait not currently I know that
[03:17:53] doesn't look good but tanari has been on
[03:17:56] a [ __ ] attack s this whole time cuz I
[03:17:58] don't have a good EM1 now like Z that's
[03:18:00] not even a good EM1 true but not but it
[03:18:03] could be okay but it could be okay it
[03:18:06] could be and that's the

[03:20:46] try vendy whoa
[03:20:50] vendy dude I remember trying venty in
[03:20:52] one point dude literally like the first
[03:20:53] week I started playing the game I did
[03:20:55] vent's trial he seemed so [ __ ]
[03:21:00] broken g a prime whoa who's this
[03:21:03] character anemo
[03:21:05] archon okay let's see what he does okay
[03:21:08] that's pretty cool that's pretty cool
[03:21:09] you're in for a little shot okay can I
[03:21:12] hold his skill let's see yaho
[03:21:17] wa okay let's try this time for take
[03:21:23] off dude venty whenever venty works he's
[03:21:26] so broken dude I wish floor 12 was like
[03:21:28] this why can't we have old floor 12 why
[03:21:31] can't floor 12 just be like a [ __ ] a
[03:21:33] bunch of [ __ ] plants and
[03:21:36] slimes think you can get
[03:21:40] away
[03:21:43] nice and spicy nice and
[03:21:45] spicy let's spark things 4 11 is nice
[03:21:48] for venty yeah vent is still like a sick
[03:21:51] unit to
[03:21:52] have but not as uh prevalent as before I
[03:21:58] used to think I used to think like I
[03:22:00] would rather have sucros and venti than
[03:22:01] sucros and Kaza cuz sucos and Kazo are
[03:22:03] pretty redundant now it's like well it
[03:22:05] causes to [ __ ] crack but like it's
[03:22:08] still true it's just there's less
[03:22:09] content where vent is good that's all
[03:22:15] side
[03:22:16] effects well I literally can't I don't
[03:22:19] have any balls can't even charge

[03:31:19] through the archon quest and I just
[03:31:21] looked at how pretty the characters were
[03:31:23] Ena Zuma would probably be my favorite
[03:31:25] region or one of them I mean it's
[03:31:27] debatable but it probably would no cuz
[03:31:30] Sha but I don't
[03:31:31] really I mean you can have a favorite
[03:31:33] region even your favorite character is
[03:31:34] not from there but like
[03:31:39] unfortunately I use the transient maybe
[03:31:41] right yeah I'll use the
[03:31:57] transient I think considering lore
[03:32:00] though in the quest suu is my favorite I
[03:32:02] think it's not even close actually I say
[03:32:04] I think but it's not even close font 10
[03:32:06] so far has been good obviously I'm not
[03:32:08] like I need to catch up but so far I've
[03:32:10] enjoyed fun time but Su has been the
[03:32:12] best in terms of like actually doing the
[03:32:15] quests and lence and like exploring even
[03:32:17] exploring is really fun cuz of the like

[04:26:56] are not going to
[04:27:04] group

[04:27:09] as random you could also go to the wall
[04:27:10] and wait or stagger them like I could
[04:27:13] have waited till they're groups but
[04:27:14] that's boring
[04:27:17] everybodyin
[04:27:20] Divine go about grouping I mean you can
[04:27:22] literally stagger them isn't that what
[04:27:23] Goa does you just stagger them but like
[04:27:26] it's [ __ ]
[04:27:32] annoying wa can you force them to TP
