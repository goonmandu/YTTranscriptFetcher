[00:09:50] fault and look this is says me like I've
[00:09:53] died with her countless times but that's
[00:09:55] just cuz I click the [ __ ] card where

[00:10:26] compromise compromise yes 454 but you
[00:10:29] know why I saved them for the butt of
[00:10:31] the Hunts I couldn't Farm These early
[00:10:33] temporal Early Access I couldn't Farm
[00:10:36] These earlier so I needed to save some
[00:10:38] so so it's it's like it's POG now I can
[00:10:40] have this running in the background
[00:10:42] while we talk does that make sense does
[00:10:43] that make sense I couldn't Farm them
[00:10:44] earlier let me mute my sounds while I'm
[00:10:47] while I'm yapping anyways oh yeah I
[00:10:50] can't even do I can't even stall cuz I
[00:10:52] already streamed today this is
[00:10:53] technically it's the second streight oh
[00:10:55] you can't
[00:10:56] see it literally the world didn't reset
[00:11:00] I can't even stall even if I wanted to I
[00:11:03] can't
[00:11:04] stall that's
[00:11:07] crazy
[00:11:09] anyways NGL this has got to be most
[00:11:12] consistent streaming week in a while not
[00:11:14] a p it is it
[00:11:16] is I'm going to be busy like next week
[00:11:21] well after 4.7 but uh for now we're just
[00:11:24] [ __ ] streaming as much as I can I
[00:11:26] will say this is the plan we're doing
[00:11:29] booill uh gameplay today you know we're
[00:11:32] pulling we're having fun we're going to
[00:11:33] clear memory of chaos we're going to
[00:11:34] [ __ ] you know do the booill stuff
[00:11:36] normally then I'm ending stream I'm
[00:11:39] uploading the
[00:11:42] guide then I'm then I'm starting
[00:11:45] probably starting stream again and we're
[00:11:46] wahing maybe your camera is unfocused
[00:11:49] King
[00:11:52] really oh
[00:11:53] [ __ ]
[00:11:58] [ __ ] oh let me restart it let me restart
[00:12:03] it wait my hair is oh [ __ ] my headset's
[00:12:05] broken wait let me fix
[00:12:12] it wait yo yo wait wait wait
[00:12:20] wait dude this headset is it's like
[00:12:22] broken so I have to like lock it in
[00:12:24] place so see can you see so it doesn't
[00:12:27] like [ __ ]
[00:12:32] wait one sec one sec one
[00:12:34] sec oh it's good it's good it's
[00:12:40] good maybe you could afford more shirts
[00:12:42] if you didn't whail on every gadet bro I
[00:12:45] can afford a shirt sorry there's
[00:12:47] something called
[00:12:48] reusability
[00:12:50] sustainability okay I rewear shirts
[00:13:00] anyways I literally dude it's booill
[00:13:03] then we have wa [ __ ] to do we have the
[00:13:05] genin Regis fine event to do 4.7 coming
[00:13:08] out
[00:13:10] [ __ ] I don't even know what else but
[00:13:12] like there's a lot of stuff there's a
[00:13:13] lot of stuff we saved some trailblaze
[00:13:15] power just literally for this so that's
[00:13:17] why we were doing this in the background
[00:13:19] uh I did buy them out from the shop and
[00:13:20] I also before starting stream I think I
[00:13:22] did four or five Auto battles I also
[00:13:23] have the 2.2 quest to do but I've kind
[00:13:25] of accepted my fade at this point it
[00:13:27] like I should have done it as it
[00:13:29] released or I should have done it off
[00:13:31] stream cuz I don't mind doing it off
[00:13:33] stream but streaming it for like eight
[00:13:35] hours straight like I might go insane
[00:13:37] that's the only problem so I don't know
[00:13:39] we're going to do it we're going to do
[00:13:40] it it just came out likey 2.2 came out
[00:13:42] today I'll do it by tomorrow also I did
[00:13:46] play Harmony MC quite a bit I played
[00:13:48] them with booill pretty good character
[00:13:50] right I like them uh I don't need them
[00:13:53] they're good although if you're
[00:13:55] wondering for booill they're your good
[00:13:57] they're a good freeo play option but uh
[00:13:59] BR clears Ron May clears Pila also very
[00:14:11] good the only thing I need from 2.2
[00:14:13] Quest is
[00:14:15] um the only thing I need from duas is
[00:14:17] the boss
[00:14:19] mat so yeah oh yeah okay yeah okay don't
[00:14:23] talk listen we don't talk about Firefly
[00:14:25] we don't know anything about them [ __ ]
[00:14:27] you but I will have Harmony MC by the
[00:14:29] time they're out just so you know I will
[00:14:31] have 2.2 Quest will be done streamed by
[00:14:33] the time we got Firefly okay just so you
[00:14:35] know we will have that sorted but I'm
[00:14:38] just saying we're talking about booill
[00:14:40] today uh booill is the character I've
[00:14:42] actually played I've actually looked
[00:14:43] into uh uh video is made it'll be
[00:14:46] out who ask on your first bad HSR take
[00:14:49] I've had bad takes don't act like this
[00:14:51] is the first however this isn't a bad
[00:14:53] one if you think Harmony MC is better
[00:14:54] than BR for booill I'm object I'm sorry
[00:14:58] but but like I'm actually just sorry is
[00:14:59] the character good is Harmon MC a great
[00:15:01] you know Great Character yes they're
[00:15:03] good is are they better than BR for
[00:15:05] booill you are [ __ ] you're smoking
[00:15:07] something that I wish I was
[00:15:09] smoking same with Ron
[00:15:17] May
[00:15:22] anyways like that he has zero o unlike a
[00:15:26] chef that applies pyro with zero ey
[00:15:29] CD like has zero AOE yes he he does uh
[00:15:34] have zero AOE but the releasing a hunt
[00:15:37] propaganda game mode so he's probably
[00:15:39] going to be really good there and I also
[00:15:41] think he's really good in
[00:15:45] general HMC better imaginary weakness
[00:15:48] and there's a bunch of mobs do you know
[00:15:49] what's better than that do you know
[00:15:50] what's better than that in bit Lune and
[00:15:52] then you bench your [ __ ] booill oh
[00:15:53] you don't have a fivar okay you probably
[00:15:55] B your [ __ ] booill there anyways why
[00:15:56] the [ __ ] are you playing booill against
[00:15:59] five imaginary weak enemies brother pull
[00:16:01] for literally use [ __ ] the the use a
[00:16:04] [ __ ] erudition I'm sorry you're doing
[00:16:06] pure fiction I'm sorry I'm sorry that
[00:16:09] was toxic yeah yeah there's there's no
[00:16:12] there's no objective truths in [ __ ]
[00:16:14] star rail org genion everything's that
[00:16:15] depends I know okay sorry for making a a
[00:16:18] a a statement about how I feel I'm sure
[00:16:22] there are situations where it's wrong I
[00:16:24] apologize how however okay however I
[00:16:27] just want to say Bo Hill very good
[00:16:29] single Target also very good with BR
[00:16:32] also very good with Ron
[00:16:34] may also
[00:16:38] um if we want to talk about that
[00:16:41] stuff oh what's that a Quantum weak
[00:16:44] enemy oh [ __ ] your cely gets [ __ ]
[00:16:47] cleared by Genius of brilliant Stars
[00:16:49] booill oh [ __ ] I'm
[00:16:53] sorry I'm sorry no but uh this is
[00:16:56] actually a good set though actually a
[00:16:58] good set actually good
[00:17:00] said also this is one of the few
[00:17:02] characters where I cannot refute the
[00:17:05] eagle of Twilight line schillers AKA Z
[00:17:08] Jeff I cannot sh I cannot refute the
[00:17:11] argument that he has no good set so run
[00:17:13] action advance I can't listen I can't
[00:17:16] there's that's a pretty compelling
[00:17:17] argument now do I recommend it no but do
[00:17:20] I understand where they're coming from
[00:17:22] yes I do because booill only wants two
[00:17:24] stats break effect
[00:17:27] speed and COA that's
[00:17:34] three can I use BR Lode on Boot Hill
[00:17:37] dude you actually dude dude dude dude
[00:17:39] yes you can yes you can if you don't
[00:17:41] have a good dude dude okay let's say
[00:17:43] this is Boot Hill wait wait wait where's
[00:17:44] the hunt let's say this is Boot Hill
[00:17:46] right you don't have a ly cone you look
[00:17:48] at what you can do you can go you see
[00:17:49] how you're in the Hun lyones you can
[00:17:50] scroll down the lyones of another path
[00:17:53] oh [ __ ] a lot of HP so I don't die
[00:17:57] equip okay sorry not even joking not
[00:18:01] even joking like a little bit of a joke
[00:18:02] but like not really like okay in my look
[00:18:05] guide maker mode I say uh you can use
[00:18:07] adversarial which by the way I cooked up
[00:18:10] but my guide is so late that everyone
[00:18:12] else cooked it up already so I didn't
[00:18:13] cook anything all good it's okay but
[00:18:15] anyways you can use like a speed buffing
[00:18:17] L cone right like Yan chingan or
[00:18:18] whatever however
[00:18:21] however you can also just use a lyone of
[00:18:24] another path level 90 or no lyone [ __ ]
[00:18:27] it don't equip a lyone it doesn't even
[00:18:28] matter that
[00:18:30] much wait what are the wait I have the
[00:18:32] lyone Cs wait wait one sec one sec let
[00:18:34] me fold them
[00:18:35] up let me see what the
[00:18:39] differences it's like
[00:18:41] [ __ ]
[00:18:44] okay the difference
[00:18:47] between the difference between cruising
[00:18:51] in the Stellar sea and no light
[00:18:55] cone just like a high base attack like
[00:18:57] five star one is
[00:19:02] 5% now
[00:19:06] granted I would recommend using
[00:19:09] adversarial which is a three star but
[00:19:12] the problem with the three star is like
[00:19:13] it's very it's inconsistent to calculate
[00:19:16] because it just depends on like
[00:19:17] everything and also let's say you're
[00:19:18] playing like BR and you're action
[00:19:21] advancing the extra speed uh it's you
[00:19:23] know extra speed is extra speed like
[00:19:25] you're not mad about it but it might not
[00:19:27] like matter as much as in a normal
[00:19:32] team but
[00:19:34] anyways
[00:19:54] um um to
[00:19:57] quantify its
[00:19:59] effects
[00:20:08] value all right cool I was just yapping
[00:20:13] sorry
[00:20:15] anyways uh we are going to pull now you
[00:20:17] might be like Z what the [ __ ] you farmed
[00:20:19] 1,700 uh uh 177,000 uh uh uh Jades uh
[00:20:23] yes and no like a little bit of there
[00:20:25] may have been uh one only one only one
[00:20:28] swipe of the credit card in which case I
[00:20:30] got a me uh text message from my bank
[00:20:32] hypothetically being like is this fraud
[00:20:34] T press y if it's you an N if it's fraud
[00:20:38] and then I may have [ __ ] pressed Y
[00:20:39] and then enter a verification code but
[00:20:42] that is allegedly okay I can't admit I
[00:20:45] mean I can't confirm or deny that and
[00:20:47] also it was one okay the rest I farmed
[00:20:49] you know the rest I had hey the rest I
[00:20:51] already had but a little bit because I
[00:20:53] want his lone now like why do you want
[00:20:55] his lone you said you can run a three
[00:20:57] star right yes how however I believe my
[00:21:00] boo Hill's performance will be about
[00:21:02] what you can expect for a good booill
[00:21:04] without the lyone now you may be like Z
[00:21:06] but you have the lyone so how's it going
[00:21:08] to be about as good as a Boot Hill with
[00:21:09] the w without the lyone if you have the
[00:21:11] Lyon well uh I as you may know
[00:21:15] uh Overworld forces have been stopping
[00:21:18] me from completing the star rail 2.2
[00:21:20] Quest I haven't been able to and so
[00:21:22] because of that my Max Talent level is
[00:21:24] six listen don't laugh and so because
[00:21:28] listen F you so it will kind of average
[00:21:30] out with the lyone to be like a really
[00:21:32] like high investment Max investment
[00:21:34] booill uh without the lyone does that
[00:21:36] make sense does that make
[00:21:39] sense does that make sense dude dude I
[00:21:42] thought there would be a quick
[00:21:45] feature this is the favorite Child we
[00:21:48] get all the quality of life shits but I
[00:21:50] go to Echo of War what the [ __ ] I have
[00:21:52] to do [ __ ] bore holes
[00:21:56] Planet whose fault is that it's mine
[00:21:58] admit
[00:21:59] I I wasn't listen hey I you know caught
[00:22:02] but also it's also your fault because I
[00:22:05] was like yo chat what do you want me to

[01:00:49] little
[01:00:51] cooked have you done 2.1 yeah yeah yeah
[01:00:53] we did

[01:00:57] we only did like 30 minute 20 minutes
[01:00:59] not 30 which means we have another 5 to
[01:01:02] 7 hours
[01:01:28] Quest is fun okay I just thought about
[01:01:30] it a little I actually don't have time
[01:01:32] if I want my video to be out on time to
[01:01:34] [ __ ] do a six- hour Quest right now
[01:01:36] so and I'm not going to skip through it
[01:01:37] because I would ruin it so I actually do
[01:01:39] need to yink an account the best one I
[01:01:40] have right now has an E1 Ron may but I
[01:01:42] feel like that's a little
[01:01:44] cheating so uh I might need a booill one
[01:01:48] like just a normal booill account that's
[01:01:49] like not a whale the rest doesn't matter
[01:01:52] like your other teams don't matter as
[01:01:53] long as you can [ __ ] I could do 12 on
[01:01:55] it
[01:01:57] [ __ ] the video the video is much more
[01:01:59] important than the stream like it's not
[01:02:00] even close like streaming is like like
[01:02:04] yeah it's not even
[01:02:07] close streaming is more for
[01:02:12] fun he's my comp you have to pull him
[01:02:14] and build him

[01:10:44] okay there's more to
[01:10:47] life every pedal all will be swept away

[01:11:07] reason oh yeah also something cool with
[01:11:09] Bo Hill you'll notice when you play him
[01:11:11] is because the enemy locks into him he
[01:11:12] kind of just dies and there's not like
[01:11:14] the only way you can play around it is
[01:11:16] by [ __ ] make like either shielding

[01:25:24] which is fine you know I'm sure you're a
[01:25:26] you know get a zero cycle but like maybe

[01:26:05] yo it is what it is it is what it
[01:26:14] is uh I think I killed both here skill
[01:26:18] basic alt but then I start next wave at
[01:26:21] a bad time but I think we get both Alt
[01:26:24] no reason with you Bunch anymore I
[01:26:26] actually don't know if this kills feel
[01:26:27] like it does cuz break
[01:26:29] damage nope it doesn't it's okay we get
[01:26:32] the we get the farm skill
[01:26:35] points well one skill point he probably
[01:26:37] dies after
[01:26:38] this never mind two skill points never
[01:26:41] mind three skill
[01:26:43] points not bet okay that was pretty good
[01:26:47] still uh what's the order of

[01:27:14] okay so I only have a skill I only
[01:27:17] gained a skill point here cuz BR right
[01:27:18] if I didn't have the skill point I
[01:27:21] wouldn't have alted because then I would
[01:27:22] have to reuse my skill but since I have
[01:27:23] the skill point I Al agre agre okay I Al

[01:27:38] there was no [ __ ] BR skill point I
[01:27:40] think I would have not done that but
[01:27:42] it's okay cuz I swear my skill points
[01:27:44] were not at two before I did all the
[01:27:47] bronia
[01:27:49] [ __ ] cuz I was mental mathing my
[01:27:51] rotation and then I gained like two

[01:30:36] piece okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[01:30:38] maybe you're running this this has no
[01:30:40] break effect there's no way you're

[01:30:47] body oh right maybe it's literally just
[01:30:50] that 282 I feel like I get 300 you

[01:31:09] don't talk to me caught hey [ __ ] that's
[01:31:11] good though cuz that means room for
[01:31:12] improvement I just I don't want to [ __ ]
[01:31:13] our Harmony MC build there's a lot of
[01:31:16] Harmony MC fans in the
[01:31:19] chat she's only 150 speed right now but
[01:31:22] I mean she increases her own speed
[01:31:26] big as the
[01:31:32] what oh why did I just put HP on her
[01:31:34] what the [ __ ] why do you have an HP robe
[01:31:35] jump scare I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not
[01:31:38] here to Flame you I'm sorry I'm not here
[01:31:40] to Flame you I'm
[01:31:41] sorry I'm not really sorry actually it's
[01:31:44] pretty comical
[01:31:48] but 150 that's fine
[01:31:55] okay let me run it back this has to be
[01:31:57] still enough speed this still has to be
[01:32:01] enough no reason to Mid Max more yeah
[01:32:03] but it's fun it's fun to keep going we
[01:32:06] we'll play a different team later but
[01:32:08] well by different team I mean
[01:32:12] just locked and
[01:32:19] load come on let's do this come on let's
[01:32:23] do this
[01:32:26] I'm actually
[01:32:34] um let's
[01:32:36] do nothing sometimes I'm like should I
[01:32:39] speak and then I'm like no and then I
[01:32:40] don't speak anyone else get that no just
[01:32:43] me
[01:32:44] okay there's no
[01:32:46] reason the only problem with like when
[01:32:48] you break a lot of enemies with Bo Hill
[01:32:50] you get a lot of stacks which is good to
[01:32:51] get early the only problem with it is
[01:32:53] you that's like when you run out of
[01:32:54] skill points like usually he's not skill
[01:32:56] point like hungry and you're fine but if
[01:32:59] you're like targeting different
[01:33:03] enemies you lose a lot of skill
[01:33:06] points like now I mean I say that but
[01:33:09] like now if my
[01:33:12] bronia I [ __ ] whatever don't talk to
[01:33:15] me like now I only have two skill points
[01:33:17] and like e0 s0 BR enter the
[01:33:20] storm to guard and defend
[01:33:24] you don't have enough see I just gained
[01:33:25] a skill point but without that I
[01:33:26] wouldn't have had enough
[01:33:27] so anyways let's
[01:33:30] do there's your reward you'll pay me
[01:33:33] you'll pay for this huh you'll pay for
[01:33:37] this buster
[01:33:58] there's no reason with you those with
[01:34:00] the Lo gun Bust or maybe I'll take it
[01:34:04] all wait really you'll take it all no
[01:34:08] don't take it
[01:34:10] all what you're going to take it
[01:34:16] all there's more to life existence is
[01:34:19] Unity every pedal all will be swept away
[01:34:22] by the wind
[01:34:26] oh you stand still oh
[01:34:29] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it seems we've reached an
[01:34:33] [Laughter]
[01:34:38] impass you see it seems we've reached an
[01:34:41] impass oh [ __ ] sorry
[01:34:47] fudge honestly it's
[01:34:50] fine we've entered the storm
[01:34:53] guard in defend crush them but that's
[01:34:56] just yeah that's just the problem with
[01:34:58] multiple enemies like that's not really
[01:34:59] on him well it is on him but like that's
[01:35:01] just how his kid is
[01:35:03] designed we still clear in the cycle I
[01:35:07] think actually I don't think we do I
[01:35:09] don't think this Al does
[01:35:12] anything
[01:35:14] 20K it's okay it's okay it's okay I
[01:35:17] needed skill points anyways now you're
[01:35:18] dead yep I should have aled though that
[01:35:20] Al is bad it's okay I mean it was it was
[01:35:22] a hail Mar attempt you know it's fine
[01:35:24] good attempt good attempt his alt is
[01:35:26] just for like implant and breaking Bo
[01:35:28] Hill's alt is not for dealing damage so
[01:35:30] alting there was dumb okay then why did
[01:35:32] you Al cuz I'm stupid oh really 318k
[01:35:35] what the [ __ ] Z hello hello hello

[01:35:51] talk to me don't talk to me don't talk
[01:35:53] to me I don't want to talk right now you
[01:35:56] also remove Ron mayik con which gives
[01:35:57] you a skill point well okay I don't want
[01:35:59] like full whale team like I'm trying to
[01:36:01] like you know I'm trying to be like a
[01:36:03] little relatable okay like a little bit
[01:36:05] like just a little
[01:36:10] bit I want to try focusing this
[01:36:13] enemy ignoring the dog see the
[01:36:15] difference qu you can taste the
[01:36:16] difference quality
[01:36:19] makes
[01:36:21] those and elegant
[01:36:24] every pedal all will be swept away by
[01:36:26] the
[01:36:30] wind no dirty
[01:36:33] tricks yo yo yo I don't S1 everyone most
[01:36:36] characters I don't get their
[01:36:38] signature I'm going to be honest I
[01:36:40] actually don't know why I got boot Hills
[01:36:42] but I I like Boot Hill and I think it's
[01:36:43] cool so that's why I just answered my
[01:36:45] own question also I just aled before
[01:36:47] alting but it doesn't matter it does no
[01:36:48] damage anyways wow
[01:36:51] 36k we've entered the storm
[01:36:54] to guard and defend CR them that
[01:36:57] actually better than I
[01:36:59] expected bring it on we're just going to
[01:37:01] focus this
[01:37:03] person lend me your
[01:37:08] strength yeah there's no way that's
[01:37:10] better than killing the dog first for
[01:37:12] Stacks
[01:37:13] right like this is our first cycle let
[01:37:16] me let me see the difference sorry sorry
[01:37:17] sorry sorry cuz if you don't know
[01:37:18] educational moment if you don't know
[01:37:20] every time you win a duel on Boot Hill
[01:37:21] he gets a [ __ ] stack and then Stacks
[01:37:23] make him do more like he'll break faster
[01:37:25] and I think also does more
[01:37:31] damage there's so much text I lowkey
[01:37:34] forget let me read it again but I know
[01:37:35] he just get like each stack it's more
[01:37:37] efficiency yeah see and damage yeah both
[01:37:42] yep basic attack toughness reduction
[01:37:44] increases by 50 stacking three times and
[01:37:46] you deal more
[01:37:47] break so like it's way better to just
[01:37:49] [ __ ] kill the little [ __ ] this
[01:37:51] battle is unavoidable l your strength it
[01:37:54] just it's skill point uh it cost a lot
[01:37:57] of skill points to do
[01:37:58] that like if I do this that's minus one
[01:38:01] skill point then Ron May plus one then
[01:38:03] plus
[01:38:04] one then minus one minus one minus
[01:38:08] one which is
[01:38:10] enough right cuz we go to 1 plus two
[01:38:12] that's three minus three that's zero but
[01:38:16] then we go back to Ron May so we're
[01:38:19] fine yeah bring it
[01:38:22] on there's your
[01:38:25] those gun

[01:58:29] I did
[01:58:33] that keep in mind that wasn't amazing
[01:58:36] but it's also like worst case scenario
[01:58:38] for Bo Hill like two waves of a [ __ ] ton
[01:58:41] of enemies is literally boot Hill's
[01:58:43] worst content and we weren't using Ron
[01:58:45] May who's like his
[01:58:47] second it's debatable I think br's
[01:58:49] probably better but I also like Ron
[01:58:51] mayore cuz I think is the most broken
[01:58:52] unit that's ever been designed in any
[01:58:54] video game ever but I'm biased
[01:58:57] anyways that's just me though I I think
[01:59:00] Ron is like stupid broken like like more
[01:59:02] than like more than what is reasonable
[01:59:05] but BR is like realistically his best
[01:59:07] support
[01:59:12] anyways
[01:59:16] okay uh wait is there even any other
[01:59:20] content where I can use him though cuz
[01:59:21] there's no like
[01:59:23] we don't have the [ __ ] other mode
[01:59:28] yet second side yeah but is it even like
[01:59:31] there's
[01:59:32] still it's still [ __ ] 1 2 3 4
[01:59:37] five yeah pure
[01:59:40] fiction
[01:59:47] woo it's all physical though sorry true
[01:59:52] true but like uh these enemies
[01:59:57] are okay the dogs are kind of annoying
[02:00:00] is but like these enemies are usually
[02:00:01] either weak to Boot Hill or aventurine
[02:00:03] so you can kind of break them pretty
[02:00:04] easy but these are all imaginary
[02:00:06] physical and this one's physical
[02:00:09] second's probably
[02:00:13] better wait do you want me to okay I'll
[02:00:16] use your [ __ ] acon wait what the [ __ ]
[02:00:18] I could just do I need a Healer or can I
[02:00:20] just [ __ ]

[02:57:59] bot Sparkle okay that wasn't that b what

[02:58:08] heo wait was that the same tempo brother
[02:58:10] how many
[02:58:13] double
[02:58:16] bot I forgot we were playing the song
[02:58:34] all right
[02:58:36] anyways um that was POG I need to do the
[02:58:41] 2 by2 Quest still
[02:58:49] do you want to Chad I'm tired no I'm not
[02:58:51] tired I just I know that I have to go
[02:58:52] upload a video so I don't know if I
[02:58:54] should end or not cuz I have to upload
[02:58:57] that's all the only thing is I might um
[02:59:01] I might glaze Harmony MC a little bit
[02:59:03] more but I think like I played them a
[02:59:05] bunch just not in like well actually I
[02:59:07] did play them against ja part it just
[02:59:09] makes your number look cooler but and it
[02:59:11] it helps like AOE especially if
[02:59:13] imaginary week but like most of the
[02:59:15] times especially in content where booill
[02:59:17] is good going twice is going to give you
[02:59:18] more damage like 1.5 times times in your
[02:59:21] damage with each hit is not as good as
[02:59:23] just going twice and then getting twice
[02:59:24] as much but in like this content I think
[02:59:27] she's actually
[02:59:29] better so I did under glaze them a
[02:59:31] little I might overg glaze them a little
[02:59:33] not over I might balance it like I might
[02:59:35] have underg glazed I might add a little
[02:59:37] bit of glazing to glaze
[02:59:40] properly they try Bron HMC Ron HMC is
[02:59:44] really [ __ ] good because your super
[02:59:45] break does more damage

[03:02:55] in a I was in a taxi with like this this
[03:02:57] like dude he was like a a Quebec redneck

[03:03:07] lie and I was just like nodding my head

[03:04:16] this team Cooks harder than BR for this
[03:04:18] type of content specifically overall I
[03:04:20] recommend BR she's his best support in
[03:04:22] my opinion I will fight you till the
[03:04:24] grave but for this type of content I
[03:04:26] agree HMC Cooks pretty well okay I I
[03:04:30] agree now with that in mind I did I did
[03:04:34] do
[03:04:35] better I did do better than the AI I'm
