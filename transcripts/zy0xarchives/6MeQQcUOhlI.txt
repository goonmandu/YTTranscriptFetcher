[00:10:16] balls and the Jean outfit has me half
[00:10:18] naked okay and my dad was here and he
[00:10:21] would have seen me with the [ __ ] I
[00:10:22] would have had to explain why I'm
[00:10:23] wearing a blonde wig over talking to
[00:10:26] people it would not have gone down well
[00:10:28] okay it wouldn't I think I'm gonna Jean
[00:10:30] made out or Jean outfit one of the two
[00:10:33] acts I can't do both I literally can't I
[00:10:35] for I actually can't but I'll do one of
[00:10:37] the two anyways I really want to do it I
[00:10:40] did not mean to but listen okay there's
[00:10:43] a reason why first of all I told you
[00:10:45] guys about this a while ago but um I
[00:10:49] have to and there's a few things I have
[00:10:52] to do okay the first thing is I'll be
[00:10:54] gone for 2 days which is nothing I
[00:10:56] didn't stream in 2 days anyways and I
[00:10:57] was home so it's not like you guys would
[00:10:59] notice but for those of you going I will
[00:11:02] be in whatever [ __ ] Berkeley means
[00:11:04] I'm kidding it's San Francisco I will be
[00:11:06] here I to T out good things because it
[00:11:07] looks hype and they're like yo do you
[00:11:09] want to come to this and then you can
[00:11:10] make a short out of it so I'm going to
[00:11:11] make a short out of it so I'm going um
[00:11:13] so yes so if you guys are there I will
[00:11:15] see you um but I'm only going for one
[00:11:17] day and I will be back on the 3rd or the
[00:11:21] 4th I don't really know so I don't talk
[00:11:25] about personal life a lot but my
[00:11:27] grandma's sick so I'm like kind of going
[00:11:29] that's why I didn't stream yesterday I
[00:11:30] was at the I went to see her I don't
[00:11:32] know what's happening but I'm like so
[00:11:33] I'm going there and I'm coming back the
[00:11:34] next day and then I'm going to see how
[00:11:37] she's feeling and then I'm going to
[00:11:38] probably the day after I'll be live and
[00:11:40] then argen comes out on the 6th so fifth
[00:11:42] for na so I don't know but that's that
[00:11:46] uh that's why I was not streaming
[00:11:47] yesterday hello Mr go smash your
[00:11:51] pass goas okay that's a that's a
[00:11:55] bad but anyways yeah so um
[00:12:00] for now we're going to do so I was going
[00:12:01] to do the archon quest first but I don't
[00:12:03] really have time to do like all that so
[00:12:04] we're going to do the I was going to do
[00:12:06] that and then the account review but
[00:12:07] we're going to swap the order we do the
[00:12:08] account riew first but there going to be
[00:12:09] a banger so we got to get excited for
[00:12:11] that
[00:12:13] um but
[00:12:16] yeah no it's fine Chad it's fine like
[00:12:19] it's not like is what it is she just she
[00:12:22] fell um she fell and then whatever like
[00:12:26] that's fine she only broke like she like
[00:12:28] fractured her arm sucks but it's not
[00:12:29] that big of a deal but then I feel like
[00:12:32] if you're old once you go to the
[00:12:33] hospital you're kind of [ __ ] like cuz
[00:12:35] you just like stay there and then you
[00:12:36] stop moving so then your body gets worse
[00:12:38] and then yeah but so I don't know how
[00:12:40] she's feeling but hopefully she she
[00:12:41] feels better but we'll see
[00:12:43] um
[00:12:45] anyways
[00:12:49] anyways um doesn't like you know that's
[00:12:51] not the point of today's stream but just
[00:12:53] to explain because I feel like I'm not
[00:12:55] just gonna not stream doesn't matter so
[00:12:57] uh that's what I'm gonna be doing we're
[00:12:59] going to be doing Ten's account review

[00:16:58] about for people that don't have Kaza
[00:17:00] okay for some reason this popped off
[00:17:01] this has [ __ ] 9k likes in 10 hours
[00:17:03] anyways I made a thread for people that
[00:17:05] don't have Kaza where I basically just
[00:17:07] laughed I kind of felt like an [ __ ]
[00:17:09] but dude it's funny okay listen so this
[00:17:13] this didn't come out of nowhere I
[00:17:14] actually did I was literally thinking I
[00:17:16] was eating breakfast with my dad I swear
[00:17:17] to God we were at like some random
[00:17:19] breakfast place and I was thinking in my
[00:17:21] head why do I feel like I literally was
[00:17:24] comparing sug sakasa to myself as if a
[00:17:26] twitch chatter asked the question voice
[00:17:28] in my head I don't know but I I
[00:17:30] literally was like answering it and I
[00:17:31] was starting to think why does Kazo feel
[00:17:34] so much better than sucros even if
[00:17:35] sucros sometimes is better and it's was
[00:17:37] like I was starting to like I was like
[00:17:38] dude the low cool down on is grouping
[00:17:40] and like it just like okay how do I
[00:17:42] explain this you know the like FR you
[00:17:44] know the Emojis okay uh frowny face
[00:17:47] middle face happy face emoji green
[00:17:51] yellow red let's see oh my God I got it
[00:17:54] I'm the [ __ ] god of Google image
[00:17:56] search holy [ __ ] call me [ __ ] Google
[00:17:59] and Gary
[00:18:01] okay hey thanks for saving my dog from
[00:18:04] that burning building I topped up your
[00:18:06] resin for you King okay BS when I'm
[00:18:09] playing let me show you guys something
[00:18:11] okay when I am
[00:18:16] playing okay when I am I have no anemo
[00:18:20] unit in my team and I have to fight
[00:18:21] content where I wish I could group them
[00:18:23] like I'm doing ayss okay no anemo
[00:18:25] grouper this is how I feel
[00:18:28] when I put sucus on my team I feel like
[00:18:30] this and when I put kazuwa I feel like
[00:18:32] this and I was trying to rationalize why
[00:18:34] I literally saw those in my brain by the
[00:18:36] way while I was eating breakfast I saw
[00:18:38] these Smiles I was like why am I like
[00:18:40] this about sucros and like this about
[00:18:42] kazua in the same team where sucros
[00:18:44] could technically perform better and I
[00:18:46] was thinking about it I was like dude I
[00:18:48] would rather walk into traffic in game
[00:18:51] than have to like then then go from
[00:18:53] grouping with Kaza to grouping with
[00:18:55] sucros and there's nothing wrong to I
[00:18:57] think sucros is broken underrated really
[00:18:59] good and like I'm just it's just it's
[00:19:02] listen okay it's just like the feeling
[00:19:05] of of Kaza inside your account is like
[00:19:09] unprecedented okay that's all it is and
[00:19:11] I love sugr I will make a video on how
[00:19:13] sugr is underrated and broken every day
[00:19:15] of the week cuz she is but Cosell just
[00:19:18] feels so good I can't explain it I
[00:19:23] can't Super Girls doesn't have [ __ ]
[00:19:25] eye for she's like and then dies but I
[00:19:27] love her she
[00:19:28] great
[00:19:34] anyways where's venty okay venty is
[00:19:37] funny cuz ventti ventti is never like
[00:19:40] useless cuz you can always swirl right
[00:19:42] but so venty starts here but very
[00:19:46] rapidly you go either double frowny
[00:19:49] face you either go to this or you go to
[00:19:52] double happy face so his Highs are
[00:19:55] higher than kaz's Highs but his lows are
[00:19:57] lower than like Dory lows no that's not
[00:19:59] true cuz venty can always swirl and he's
[00:20:01] he's never like useless but it just
[00:20:03] feels so bad if you press your q and
[00:20:05] then the [ __ ] big ass enemy you're
[00:20:07] fighting just walks through
[00:20:15] it does that make sense I just explained
[00:20:19] the the sucros but okay because now this
[00:20:21] might get clipped and in case it does
[00:20:23] let me add something okay suos is great
[00:20:26] and really strong and also
[00:20:28] because she's like free to play
[00:20:29] accessible like fourar it makes it to
[00:20:31] where you don't like have to feel forc
[00:20:33] to get Kazo right but there's something
[00:20:35] about grouping with kazua he just feels
[00:20:37] so good to play and then you play sucros
[00:20:39] and she's like I like playing her on a
[00:20:40] driver on field and that's when she
[00:20:42] shines but also it's just like she feels
[00:20:44] like dude you burst you have your C
[00:20:46] you're going infusing it infuses the
[00:20:48] [ __ ] air when you're playing [ __ ]
[00:20:49] electricity okay you try to group an
[00:20:51] enemy it [ __ ] groups you into your
[00:20:54] grave I don't know I don't know okay
[00:20:55] maybe skill issue probably skill issue
[00:20:58] but it's just like a difference in like
[00:21:00] my
[00:21:01] emotions I didn't realize we would doing
[00:21:04] suc it's not a okay this is not sugr
[00:21:07] slander listen I'm the biggest sugr
[00:21:09] Defender most people think coo is way
[00:21:11] better I don't I think sugr is
[00:21:14] genuinely very powerful and can be used
[00:21:17] as a driver when Kwa can't but when it
[00:21:20] comes to grouping and feeling the
[00:21:22] grouping this it's like night and day
[00:21:24] it's literally night and day I'm sorry
[00:21:26] I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:21:28] I'm sorry also Su can Gooba swirl let's
[00:21:30] say you're playing tartaglia Ajax and
[00:21:33] and Shang Ling right Shang Ling Goa and
[00:21:35] then you're like how do I swirl pyro and
[00:21:37] hydro well with Kazo you could you know
[00:21:38] swirl the hydro and then burst Infuse
[00:21:40] your Pyro from Bennett but with sugr you
[00:21:43] can like wait for the exclamation mark
[00:21:44] on Goa he shoots fire you swir that
[00:21:48] [ __ ] hello Z Jeff this was just bait to

[00:52:07] she does of course she does okay who
[00:52:09] else is from the sh Vu it could be it
[00:52:11] could be it could be there's actually so
[00:52:13] many characters from there holy [ __ ]
[00:52:16] uh who came out recently toaz much she's
[00:52:18] fire because it's a new boss match so
[00:52:19] has to be someone new uh CFA and blade
[00:52:22] are from the [ __ ] thing that the bad
[00:52:24] guys whatever the [ __ ] it's called
[00:52:26] uh who else is from there where is wo
[00:52:29] from I actually don't know whoo lore I
[00:52:31] have no I don't know her lore but I
[00:52:33] think her name is Chinese so she's
[00:52:34] probably from there nope never mind wait
[00:52:35] is she from there okay cool
[00:52:38] uh
[00:52:42] oh no he's yeah he's he's uh destruction
[00:52:46] imaginary it has to be cuz he uses those
[00:52:48] mats wait does he use his mats I think
[00:52:49] he does yeah he does he definitely does
[00:52:51] I I [ __ ] crowned him oh my God it's
[00:52:54] not him but it was okay good guess that
[00:52:55] was such a good guess though another
[00:52:58] destruction character who's destruction
[00:53:00] uh uh
[00:53:01] blade is blade considered a stellon
[00:53:03] hunter I think he is right cuz he's like
[00:53:05] with Kafka he's like I am blade so he's
[00:53:09] probably I don't think it can be well
[00:53:12] he's wind okay he's not oh wait wait
[00:53:13] wait I have the type I have the type a
[00:53:15] destruction of wait what types are left
[00:53:16] there's lightning could be a lightning
[00:53:18] destruction I ly forget what the [ __ ]
[00:53:20] Arland is but no he's from the he's from
[00:53:22] the SP the the space thing uh uh okay
[00:53:26] another destruction let me think Hook is
[00:53:28] no she's
[00:53:30] fire claraa is where the [ __ ] is clar
[00:53:33] clar is from underground right she's
[00:53:34] from the [ __ ] wait where is clar yeah
[00:53:36] she's not from there clar is not from
[00:53:38] there but clar is destruction uh what
[00:53:39] other types are there there's physical
[00:53:41] there's
[00:53:43] lightning and there's
[00:53:46] ice but it has to be a new character
[00:53:48] because of this
[00:53:49] m wait it's a new character that makes
[00:53:51] it easy who are the new destru oh it
[00:53:54] might be a forestar that I didn't level
[00:53:55] who are the new destruction characters
[00:53:57] that came out there's blade there's Dan
[00:53:58] hung and B Lune oh jinglu jingu
[00:54:06] dude I don't know
[00:54:21] why why am I afraid to click thisy has
[00:54:24] more fill of than one pie
[00:54:25] dude I'm just afraid to click and it's
[00:54:28] not her I'm trying to think am I dumb am
[00:54:30] I stupid could it be any could
[00:54:33] it why Can't We Be Friends why Can't We
[00:54:38] Be why can't we
[00:54:45] be okay cool okay the only reason I was
[00:54:48] like concerned about her is
[00:54:50] cuz I don't know I I don't know I was
[00:54:54] like what if it's someone else also Al
[00:54:55] she literally plays like a hunt carry so
[00:54:56] I was like doubting
[00:54:58] myself daily quote old witch a Natasha
[00:55:02] is so beautiful and
[00:55:04] nice
[00:55:06] what
[00:55:07] hook old
[00:55:11] witchy Natasha is beautiful and nice but
[00:55:15] when she gets angry she uh isn't so nice
[00:55:20] but but still beautiful
[00:55:24] true
[00:55:25] I'm Natasha an
[00:55:28] underworld I'm Natasha I'm
[00:55:36] Natasha all right well I think we're
[00:55:38] ready no stalling no stalling and we got
[00:55:41] some resin from that easy
[00:55:48] resin may I
[00:55:52] present okay can I say something with
[00:55:54] finina why why do her three little
[00:55:56] homies just want to kill everything they
[00:55:58] literally don't stop there'll be a
[00:55:59] [ __ ] seal chilling they attack it
[00:56:01] there'll be a random pillar they attack
[00:56:03] it they literally attack
[00:56:05] anything they're [ __ ] bloodthirsty
[00:56:09] dude anyways this is the team we have to
[00:56:12] play today cuz I need background footage
[00:56:14] for my G video uh I was playing this off
[00:56:16] stream I did an abyss clear to show uh
[00:56:19] Jean Sunfire but my ryen was literally
[00:56:21] critting 300K and one shotting
[00:56:23] everything and then it wasn't a gen team
[00:56:25] so I don't know what we're going to do
[00:56:26] but it is what it is C2 pep W
[00:56:30] true dude AR right is actually not bad
[00:56:33] right now she's actually not bad right
[00:56:35] now I got a new ciret it's not the best
[00:56:36] ciret not the best goblet but the Sands
[00:56:39] is fire the feather really good flower
[00:56:48] um pretty good so it's actually pretty
[00:56:53] good
[00:56:56] it's okay for someone who doesn't Farm
[00:56:58] emblem it's okay there is no ese M there
[00:57:01] a
[00:57:06] prime 150 crit damage arm I don't have
[00:57:10] dude it's are you dense okay the average
[00:57:15] listen s this is one to two okay almost
[00:57:19] almost one to two this is
[00:57:23] good
[00:57:28] anyways 77 em shut your mouth okay shut
[00:57:32] your mouth what do you want me to do
[00:57:34] about this goblet man what do you want
[00:57:35] me to
[00:57:36] do my goblet sucks
[00:57:42] okay my sh is
[00:57:46] 103 has
[00:57:48] 103 we could have had it all with the
[00:57:51] flower where is it I think I threw it
[00:57:53] away we actually could have had it all
[00:57:56] and then tragedy
[00:58:08] struck Y is best stat yeah but not
[00:58:19] for doesn't ryen want an attack goblet
[00:58:22] it subs that dependent but also with
[00:58:24] engulfing light
[00:58:25] with engulfing lightning usually going
[00:58:27] ER and and Electro is very pogers but
[00:58:30] it's sub
[00:58:33] dependent also I mean with finina we get
[00:58:35] damage percent so attack's probably
[00:58:36] better cuz I forgot we have finina now
[00:58:39] so attack might be better now but it
[00:58:40] doesn't matter it's [ __ ] sub
[00:58:44] stats actually do I have a better attack
[00:58:46] goblet you know what maybe I do maybe I
[00:58:49] do I was thinking I don't but I might uh
[00:58:53] I mean it's about as good it's actually
[00:58:56] dude why why I mean it's it is
[00:59:00] technically better it is technically one
[00:59:03] substat more but we lose 58
[00:59:08] em
[00:59:12] um oh but we also have Bennett I
[00:59:15] actually don't I feel like it I actually
[00:59:16] don't know if it balances
[00:59:18] out I don't know I actually don't want
[00:59:20] to think right now so we're just going
[00:59:21] to keep this okay let's uh let's let's
[00:59:23] now not stall we're going to do we have
[00:59:26] resin to spend we uh don't worry about
[00:59:28] why I talked you guys about why it's
[00:59:29] overc we have the abyss to clear at
[00:59:32] least two
[00:59:33] times and I have to I have uh I have to
[00:59:37] go to you know places we talked about
[00:59:38] this other side of the stream so I have
[00:59:40] to leave in four hours or I'm [ __ ]
[00:59:42] however we're going to start with the
[00:59:43] the main show the main course while I
[00:59:45] still have energy so I can make the
[00:59:46] video entertaining and then after we
[00:59:48] could chill okay okay if you make it to
[00:59:50] the end someone's getting naked what no
[00:59:53] I didn't say that but we are GNA do an
[00:59:55] account review um a whale account review
[00:59:59] and I was gonna take a random whale but
[01:00:00] I was like wait a second what if I took
[01:00:01] the biggest whale so we're gonna review
[01:00:04] TNA's account and it's going to be great
[01:00:06] it's going to be a good video chat's
[01:00:08] going to be in
[01:00:12] it and
[01:00:14] um
[01:00:23] yeah
[01:00:27] thanks for 150 bits Barry the shark okay
[01:00:29] let me DM Mr
[01:00:37] T uh let me go back to genin I'm going
[01:00:40] to do a quick domain clear just while
[01:00:41] we're chilling might as well
[01:00:53] uh [ __ ] I clicked on my Riot client
[01:00:57] um okay let's
[01:01:08] just why are people calling finina mid
[01:01:11] it always happens it literally okay
[01:01:13] think about it good character gets
[01:01:15] released people call her good then
[01:01:17] everyone's like wait she's not good and
[01:01:19] then it balances out after a while it's
[01:01:21] always like that every character gets
[01:01:22] called mid it's just the cycle of life
[01:01:24] it is what it
[01:01:30] is it's the cycle of life every
[01:01:33] character will always be called mid
[01:01:35] every
[01:01:41] time nlet was never mid nlet is broken
[01:01:46] but the thing with nevet is he's a DPS
[01:01:48] so mid no no no he's not not he's not
[01:01:52] but everyone does call everything thing
[01:01:54] mid I will say oddly enough despite
[01:01:58] supports being better than DPSS I feel
[01:02:01] like supports get called mid less uh
[01:02:03] more often than DPSS cuz DPS is okay
[01:02:06] that's not true if a DPS is bad they get
[01:02:08] called midmore but I feel like if a DPS
[01:02:10] looks good people are like wow they're
[01:02:11] broken a lot more now You Shall Perish
[01:02:14] now You Shall
[01:02:21] Perish St DEA dreams to be called mid
[01:02:24] dude that is [ __ ] that is
[01:02:28] [ __ ] was never Nito is never mid true
[01:02:31] but also you have to remember that
[01:02:33] before Nikita our best dental option was
[01:02:35] [ __ ]
[01:02:36] DMC DMC is not bad by the way DMC is a
[01:02:39] good option but
[01:02:45] yeah the upgrade from from endro
[01:02:49] characters to Nita was [ __ ] huge
[01:02:51] Nita's still broken by the way but like
[01:02:54] the upgrade a like okay picture this
[01:02:56] right let's say you have let me let me
[01:02:58] let me let me let me explain okay okay
[01:03:00] let's say okay let's say okay let's say
[01:03:03] okay let's say okay to compare okay this
[01:03:06] isn't a onetoone comparison so don't
[01:03:08] quote me on this however let's say the
[01:03:10] only Hydro options right now were
[01:03:12] [ __ ] Cole and dendro MC no but let's
[01:03:16] say the only Hydro options we had were
[01:03:17] Barbara and what's the equivalent of Dy
[01:03:20] but hydro hydro is dog [ __ ] so that
[01:03:21] doesn't exist but like I don't know
[01:03:25] Mona maybe SRO but cro is way more
[01:03:27] broken than D
[01:03:37] MC the thing when the he that's broken
[01:03:40] though is you can literally always use
[01:03:41] her in any dender team
[01:03:43] always fin you can use her in any Hydra
[01:03:45] team but you need a Healer that's good
[01:03:48] uh which means that it's uh she is more
[01:03:51] prone to one of two things one because
[01:03:53] there's a lot of other Hydra options a
[01:03:55] lot of people can be like hey I already
[01:03:56] have a good one I don't need her or I
[01:03:57] have another one why would I get her
[01:03:59] well that's not really a good take but
[01:04:01] sure the first part is the second part
[01:04:03] isn't and then or option two a lot of
[01:04:05] people that either don't have a good
[01:04:07] healer or aren't good at healing or
[01:04:09] build their healer wrong or just kind of
[01:04:11] suck and don't like you know they're
[01:04:12] like whatever like their Gene sucks
[01:04:13] balls although it's kind of hard to have
[01:04:15] a gene that doesn't it's not good but
[01:04:16] they might play like finina bendett and
[01:04:17] then nothing else might be like wow why
[01:04:18] am I doing this to
[01:04:21] myself which is good that's good that's
[01:04:24] a good way to design a character without
[01:04:26] invalidating other kits could you
[01:04:28] imagine if finina was just sing Cho but
[01:04:30] better that would [ __ ] suck but she's
[01:04:33] like better in her own way but worse in
[01:04:34] her own way as well that's [ __ ]
[01:04:39] sick Shine Down you mean yolan shut the
[01:04:43] [ __ ] up that's bait shut up don't get me
[01:04:44] started in this war don't [ __ ] talk
[01:04:46] to me don't talk to me don't talk to me
[01:04:49] don't talk to me she's better in every
[01:04:51] way who finina than S Cho stop
[01:04:54] I think farina's [ __ ] busted but I
[01:04:56] don't think she's objectively better
[01:04:57] than S Joe stop riding [ __ ] okay we
[01:05:01] were not having this debate right now
[01:05:02] we're
[01:05:04] not wait wait a second this is

[01:08:54] they they they hunted chests and
[01:08:56] bounties okay maybe they knew what they

[01:34:24] good piece also a really good
[01:34:27] piece damn this guy actually has good
[01:34:33] NS
[01:34:36] yeah zero ER though but I don't know if
[01:34:40] how much ER C6
[01:34:45] needs okay let's just keep looking see
[01:34:48] if we see any
[01:34:49] anomalies kakomi
[01:34:52] only a twopiece why you
[01:34:54] okay
[01:34:56] uh okay okay okay okay let's look at
[01:34:59] this C6 Yia R5 thundering pulse let's

[01:35:06] insane why you have an 18 Erp
[01:35:10] on is fine
[01:35:14] HUD
[01:35:15] okay this is pretty [ __ ] good we
[01:35:17] might play
[01:35:18] this triple ground
[01:35:22] respect you have zero
[01:35:24] em you are not
[01:35:26] vaping uh what do we look at what do we
[01:35:29] look at you know what that's 3K defense
[01:35:33] is that normal am I okay that's why I
[01:35:35] was like why is this defense at
[01:35:38] 3K
[01:35:44] holy wait who should we
[01:35:49] check C6 strong Lee I'm pretty sure this
[01:35:52] is a shield bot build yeah this is
[01:35:53] definitely a shield
[01:35:55] bot C6 Shield bot actually I mean he is
[01:35:58] on crit crit Gio HP duuke okay we'll
[01:36:03] check your duuke are you a deluk Ander
[01:36:08] tanha Beacon of the Reed SE could be his
[01:36:11] I mean it is his best in slot especially
[01:36:14] with an attack buffing
[01:36:16] support um I think kind of forget it's
[01:36:19] been a while the luk GU soon though
[01:36:21] begin of the re SE uh Crimson Witch of
[01:36:24] flames Triple
[01:36:26] Crown
[01:36:28] C6 let's look at it I can make that R5
[01:36:31] why I do you actually have others holy
[01:36:34] why do you have so many
[01:36:42] beacons this is this is eight not 10
[01:36:46] beacons and another one
[01:36:50] 11
[01:36:53] wait let's look let's look CRI of flames
[01:36:55] wow okay that's insane unfortunately on
[01:36:57] the defense role but still [ __ ]
[01:36:59] insane uh holy [ __ ] wait this might be
[01:37:02] your best character what the hell okay
[01:37:05] that's unfortunate uh do you have a
[01:37:07] better
[01:37:09] one wow you actually don't that is so
[01:37:12] sad wait you're on a five piece though
[01:37:15] oh my what is
[01:37:18] this how do you have a how do you have a
[01:37:21] six crit rate 30 crit damage plus an
[01:37:23] attack roll Crimson Witch of flames pyro
[01:37:27] goblet I know someone who would
[01:37:28] literally kill in game for this
[01:37:37] piece actually half of my mods would
[01:37:39] anyways let's move on uh ciret that
[01:37:42] that's also insane unfortunately on the
[01:37:43] other roles but 15 almost 15 crit ra
[01:37:45] makes it just insane by default this
[01:37:47] might unironically be better by the way
[01:37:49] not to be a backseater but uh 8% attack
[01:37:52] 61 em for a little bit less crit rate oo
[01:37:56] and then okay let's say we take you off
[01:37:57] five Crimson witch I don't know why I'm
[01:37:58] doing this but I'm just going to do this
[01:38:00] let's say we take you off five Crimson
[01:38:01] Witch uh put you on a four piece with a
[01:38:04] biscuit let's see what it could look
[01:38:06] like let's see what it could look like
[01:38:07] look
[01:38:09] like oh my God I might need to change my
[01:38:13] pants attacks a bit low but it doesn't
[01:38:15] matter cuz you often times run the Luke
[01:38:17] with Bennett 247 em 99 crit rate 26 CR
[01:38:21] damage or
[01:38:23] 18 we're actually going to try
[01:38:34] this where did the bird go anyways let's
[01:38:37] keep going wait who else should we check
[01:38:43] CLE
[01:38:45] what what the [ __ ] is this
[01:38:50] piece
[01:38:53] bro give this to
[01:38:57] someone
[01:38:59] holy wait what's your best emblem piece
[01:39:02] you have so much oh what is wait let's
[01:39:05] look at your ryen what
[01:39:07] the this is so good flower also pretty
[01:39:11] cracked oh my wait this is insane wait
[01:39:14] this is madness look at this what weapon
[01:39:17] are you on engulfing R5 C6 crap
[01:39:22] crowned double crowned no no no not
[01:39:24] double crown cuz constellations but
[01:39:27] crowned pretty
[01:39:29] good that's pretty cracked for like a no
[01:39:32] crit weapon this is
[01:39:34] insane all right cool a lot of
[01:39:35] characters we get to try out
[01:39:42] today want to get pegged okay please
[01:39:45] don't put this in the video but to
[01:39:47] reiterate my stance crowning right in
[01:39:49] just her burst is base because it's
[01:39:51] optimal and you get her skill to level 9
[01:39:53] cuz that's when it stops increasing
[01:39:54] burst damage the the the ryen players
[01:39:57] that want to get pegged are those that
[01:39:58] triple crown her even though it does
[01:40:00] nothing that's the difference okay if I
[01:40:03] click on Ryden or Yi and it's Triple
[01:40:05] Crown then you can tell but if it's just
[01:40:07] one Crown maybe two it's
[01:40:10] different
[01:40:13] anyways
[01:40:15] uh why is on
[01:40:19] 511
[01:40:25] damn okay
[01:40:27] okay that's pretty insane obviously
[01:40:29] there's not much to like fix uh it's
[01:40:32] mostly going to be a review and showcase
[01:40:34] than uh like standard account fixing cuz
[01:40:37] obviously what the [ __ ] can I fix other
[01:40:40] than
[01:40:43] gotcha SS crowned I respect that when
[01:40:46] four stars are crowned on a leviathan I
[01:40:47] respect that Shang
[01:40:49] Ling close enough you should Crown guoba
[01:40:51] but it is what it
[01:40:58] is show
[01:41:01] Ayo AO is uh on a Haron R1 four Echoes
[01:41:06] actually farmed Echoes that's
[01:41:08] concerning pretty good yeah pretty good

[01:47:21] it's your that you were quiet is that
[01:47:23] I'm really loud so balances now okay
[01:47:26] okay first question very quickly before
[01:47:28] we start why is your Scara called minus
[01:47:32] 1600 okay oh wait wa wait um aboba what
[01:47:36] is this why your don't enable them don't
[01:47:39] enable
[01:47:41] them don't it's so it's an okay yeah
[01:47:45] keep yeah I don't want to explain it
[01:47:46] it's just AB Boba look at it he's just
[01:47:48] saying AB Boba I don't know now this has
[01:47:50] to be in the video
[01:47:54] [ __ ] Okay the reason why my scara's name
[01:47:58] is minus one uh $1,600 is because that's
[01:48:02] how much I spent to get his seven copies
[01:48:04] and his weapon jeez how many wait how
[01:48:06] many did you how many uh 50/50s did you
[01:48:09] lose actually I don't really count that
[01:48:12] oh I don't know on average I lose like
[01:48:15] three to four times no that's
[01:48:19] unfortunate
[01:48:21] uh okay do you use him wait his talents
[01:48:23] are kind of low I didn't notice do you
[01:48:24] even use scar wait I don't want to get
[01:48:26] you in in beef with the Scara
[01:48:29] Community oh no no no I use all the
[01:48:31] characters like when I feel like it I
[01:48:32] use them right but then after I activate
[01:48:35] their constellation they're just too
[01:48:36] strong so I don't really care about
[01:48:37] their talent levels anymore dude I I
[01:48:40] actually feel that I activated my C2
[01:48:42] okay I'm not a C6 but activated my C2
[01:48:44] right in and it's like she on shots
[01:48:46] everything I don't even want to use her
[01:48:47] anymore it's like dude she's just too
[01:48:48] broken but you're saying
[01:48:51] without that makes
[01:48:53] sense and also a lot of the people use R
[01:48:55] and with em build right so I'm just like
[01:48:58] sitting here and asking like why do I
[01:48:59] need to build my R and Shogun em when I
[01:49:01] need to just do a lot of damage by
[01:49:03] herself you know I have a question yes
[01:49:06] is that 21 million
[01:49:09] Mora uh yes why do you have 21 million
[01:49:15] Mora dude the most I've ever had is like
[01:49:19] five
[01:49:20] I am so broke in
[01:49:23] genin anyways okay yeah
[01:49:27] yeah uh I don't know like if you farm
[01:49:30] for a lot of artifacts and if you don't
[01:49:31] have anything to upgrade then I guess
[01:49:33] you get a lot of moras in return cuz you
[01:49:35] can sell all those three star four star
[01:49:38] uh artifacts right I see well I always
[01:49:40] have stuff to upgrade because I'm
[01:49:41] hunting for a Vermillion piece but
[01:49:43] apparently everyone in chat is saying 20
[01:49:44] mil isn't even high so maybe I'm just
[01:49:46] broke I'm sorry okay never mind move it
[01:49:50] moving on okay so Tom TOS are low cuz
[01:49:52] your C6 are broken anyways Fair what
[01:49:54] about okay who do you who do you play
[01:49:56] the
[01:49:58] most I used to play a lot of duuk right
[01:50:01] duuke yeah we're going to try it for
[01:50:03] sure
[01:50:05] but these days I use a lot of net so I
[01:50:08] guess I could say I'm net me now dude
[01:50:10] net is so broken I want to try C so fun
[01:50:14] to play she is so
[01:50:17] good it's like you literally
[01:50:20] yeah oh yeah yeah with C6 n leet you can
[01:50:23] play two games at the same time like
[01:50:25] that's how I farm in honai stario and uh
[01:50:27] G impact at the same time I just I just
[01:50:31] use my skill ultimate and then do charge
[01:50:33] attack right just leave it there out Tab
[01:50:36] and then do stuff in honai Star go back
[01:50:39] and I keep on doing things wait does
[01:50:40] that work well I have to try this yes
[01:50:42] because if once you do once you start
[01:50:43] your charge attack right you can just
[01:50:45] let it go and it will still do charge
[01:50:47] attack oh yeah yes he said wait wait wa
[01:50:50] wait let me get my
[01:50:52] burst wait I could share screen but one
[01:50:54] sec I want try this I don't have my
[01:50:55] burst
[01:50:57] yet uh make sure to use your e and uh
[01:51:00] burst and then see how long it
[01:51:06] lasts okay let go of yours
[01:51:10] click I can literally play something
[01:51:14] else down wait that's kind of wait that
[01:51:18] actually is a meta I should get this I
[01:51:20] can play [ __ ] star
[01:51:23] rail yeah damn wait now this seems like
[01:51:26] I'm promoting gambling hey kids only
[01:51:29] pull for characters if you want don't
[01:51:31] you don't need them to
[01:51:33] clear wait that's actually sick though
[01:51:35] wait let me try this somewhere
[01:51:39] else
[01:51:41] um try where should I try
[01:51:47] this look at what Z taught me people
[01:51:51] gamble okay [ __ ] you I didn't say
[01:51:56] gamble wait let me try
[01:52:00] something I can share my entire screen
[01:52:02] to you you won hear audio
[01:52:05] though oh yeah yeah it's totally fine I
[01:52:07] can see
[01:52:10] it wait what what screen is this I want
[01:52:14] to try I want to try watch watch watch
[01:52:17] watch this watch this watch this watch
[01:52:18] this watch this watch this I want to see
[01:52:19] this works wait never that's on two
[01:52:21] watch this silence let me get my burst
[01:52:23] be
[01:52:30] Sanctified it's still going
[01:52:33] right yeah it should
[01:52:35] be no no go back and check wait he's
[01:52:38] still going threat okay that was F we
[01:52:40] have to be quicker though so I can
[01:52:41] actually okay I have to I have to okay I
[01:52:44] have to get better at that
[01:52:46] anyways as we were
[01:52:48] saying uh okay so never that we'll try
[01:52:51] out for sure that seems
[01:52:53] lit what about weapons why do you have
[01:52:56] wait let me mute alerts for a second
[01:52:57] sorry thanks for the prime though
[01:53:00] uh why do you have some R1 some r5s how
[01:53:03] do you
[01:53:05] choose uh wait you have I have five
[01:53:08] copies right so I can activate that but
[01:53:12] with R1 weapon after I got him to C6 I
[01:53:16] was like okay I don't need more damage
[01:53:18] so I just left it there
[01:53:20] if I clear things faster right so for me
[01:53:22] when I do Spirit Abyss it just takes me
[01:53:24] 10 minutes now right it used to take me
[01:53:26] 30 minutes long time ago and with all
[01:53:29] those OP characters now it just takes 10
[01:53:31] minutes to clear from floor 9 to 12 so I
[01:53:34] was like okay you know I want some
[01:53:36] runtime on my stream
[01:53:38] so yeah yeah that actually make I mean I
[01:53:41] get that I what I like to do cuz I I'm
[01:53:44] I'm too good at the game so what I like
[01:53:46] to do is I I I just play like four stars
[01:53:48] or something but yeah I get that that oh
[01:53:50] well yeah that works yeah you want to
[01:53:52] play the characters you enjoy why I was
[01:53:53] using one star weapon before oh that
[01:53:56] makes sense they still clear
[01:54:02] yeah do you still clear the ones are oh
[01:54:05] do I still clear oh yeah yeah yeah easy
[01:54:07] I got full Stars
[01:54:09] d uh do you care about friendship at all
[01:54:12] do you go for friendship oh I do wait
[01:54:15] there a ooh wait this is a lot of
[01:54:18] friendship they're all level 10
[01:54:20] except the party that I had not let me
[01:54:22] started the stream wait like basically
[01:54:25] every wait a wait how many friendch of
[01:54:28] oh new I guess the new characters can't
[01:54:30] be but oh my God wait Lenny's
[01:54:34] nine wa are you a friendship
[01:54:36] farmer uh yeah I mean what is what else
[01:54:39] is there to do engage an impact other
[01:54:41] than actually for artifacts do you want
[01:54:44] to know something funny in 1.0 I was
[01:54:46] like when I first started playing first
[01:54:48] started streaming everything I was like
[01:54:50] like uh I don't care about friendship
[01:54:53] cuz like that's not what I'm playing for
[01:54:55] and eventually we'll get raids eight
[01:54:56] player raids I get to play with all my
[01:54:57] friends people come from RPGs MMOs I'll
[01:55:00] get to raid with them Co-op content
[01:55:02] Abyss floor 24 we're going to do
[01:55:03] everything it's going to be great and
[01:55:05] then as patches came by 1.1 1.2 1.6 2.0
[01:55:11] I was like wait a second the only end
[01:55:13] game is friendships like name cards so
[01:55:15] maybe maybe I should start collecting
[01:55:17] them and like so now I've actually been
[01:55:18] doing friendship
[01:55:20] yeah wasn't there a time where there was
[01:55:22] like no content for like few months we
[01:55:25] don't talk about the Dark Ages oh yeah
[01:55:27] during that time I think everyone became
[01:55:29] a friendship farmer yeah zff was so
[01:55:32] bored he pretended I remember I joined
[01:55:33] his stream once he was pretending he
[01:55:35] didn't know genin and I was watching him
[01:55:37] and he was literally like whoa what is
[01:55:39] what is this electricity and then he was
[01:55:42] I couldn't it was it was the content

[01:56:22] many yo that's a
[01:56:25] lot I used to be a mint farmer you know

[01:57:26] Google Play store or any of those like
[01:57:28] application stores where they sell like
[01:57:30] stuff right um it's like 400k so far so
[01:57:35] I'm guessing like engag in Impact is
[01:57:36] like 150k plus but yeah um and also
[01:57:41] that's Pro well also because I did a lot
[01:57:43] of giveaways here and there like in

[01:58:20] Content it's a bit different but I
[01:58:22] assume I mean but okay I I can okay the
[01:58:25] ho the the the genjin amount content
[01:58:27] sure what about the other Goda
[01:58:29] games wait which ones did you play
[01:58:31] before
[01:58:32] gench uh there was this dark game that I
[01:58:35] used to stream before G impact and I
[01:58:39] think I spent 100K on that as well but
[01:58:41] it was over like two years after I got
[01:58:43] salty about that game like I stopped
[01:58:45] spending I see so yeah but that was
[01:58:48] still like 100K okay okay um and stuff
[01:58:51] here and there um whenever I get
[01:58:54] sponsored right from a gacha game I just
[01:58:57] use all that sponsor money back into the
[01:58:58] game dude I'm like yo I heard nothing
[01:59:02] bro yeah gacha sponsors are literally
[01:59:04] like yeah you just like put it back
[01:59:07] in uh well like League I spent like not
[01:59:12] much like maybe 5K B I know why I spend
[01:59:16] money on those freeto playay games right

[01:59:28] logs on my email I look through it it's
[01:59:30] like literally nothing bad but I typed a
[01:59:31] lot I was like 14 15 so I typed a lot
[01:59:34] there nothing like bad but I was like I
[01:59:36] don't know flaming my jungler for just
[01:59:37] like I mean I was the jungler but I was
[01:59:39] like flaming my team yeah I was I don't

[02:00:07] digress oh yeah yeah for all those
[02:00:10] unbuilt characters here and there right
[02:00:12] um they still work
[02:00:14] guys yeah as long as they don't die
[02:00:16] they're still functional I mean that
[02:00:18] makes sense I had to share a lot of
[02:00:20] artifacts so that's why they're not
[02:00:22] really built okay I also have to share a
[02:00:24] lot of artifacts but bro you

[02:00:44] have 50 CV artifact on that damn dude
[02:00:48] this could have been me if Shia needed

[02:01:15] going to activate all your c6's bro no
[02:01:17] no no okay just do it for me I'm lazy
[02:01:20] okay you're clicking for me C6
[02:01:23] furina okay I can yes it is Showtime yes
[02:01:28] show we're going to be doing a Showcase
[02:01:30] with finina and net anyways right yeah
[02:01:32] should I put them in the same team or
[02:01:34] separate what do you think let put him
[02:01:36] in our same team okay uh and can you
[02:01:38] also make Net's weapon
[02:01:40] R5 really yes I [ __ ] it okay but yes
[02:01:45] pretend that it's you pretend that
[02:01:47] account hi the uid
[02:01:51] all right are you are you sure
[02:01:54] yes all [ __ ] it we ball yo let's
[02:01:59] go oh I don't want to click okay I
[02:02:02] clicked I clicked I clicked I clicked
[02:02:04] two three 4 it's too
[02:02:10] late nice C6 for now oh my God she
[02:02:14] actually like kind of DPS
[02:02:16] now like on field dude I heard finina C6
[02:02:20] is like insane yeah yeah I heard it's
[02:02:21] but I want to see how like how how much
[02:02:24] how much damage she can do compared to
[02:02:26] C6 naha because I had a little well
[02:02:29] discussion yesterday with my chat and
[02:02:31] somebody was like yeah finina is
[02:02:33] stronger and then people were like oh n
[02:02:34] is Al so strong yeah I know I know C6 so
[02:02:38] you can there's two things you can do I
[02:02:40] know you could get more damage but I
[02:02:41] think the meta from what I've seen a lot
[02:02:43] of people do is you can literally heal
[02:02:44] your team as you get damage buffed so
[02:02:45] you don't need to run a
[02:02:47] Healer wait wait becomes the
[02:02:50] Healer yeah she literally look every
[02:02:52] every second you heal your whole party
[02:02:53] based on HP so you just Perma heal and
[02:02:55] then you get more damage I just have
[02:02:57] this insane idea yo uh so we have AFK
[02:03:01] farming team we have yiko and we have
[02:03:04] furina right no
[02:03:09] but
[02:03:12] um I mean you could I actually think
[02:03:15] that would
[02:03:17] work wait do you have the normal attack
[02:03:19] to get the heal chat or is it just
[02:03:20] always no it's every time you proc the
[02:03:22] thing right so you have to normal
[02:03:25] attack oh to get healing oh can haveit
[02:03:29] right just have been it stand there and
[02:03:32] just go AFK play a snake
[02:03:35] game we actually could okay I'm done uh
[02:03:39] what the [ __ ] does Nita C6 do again oh
[02:03:41] yeah this after you use your ultimate uh
[02:03:44] the enemies that are
[02:03:47] uh enemies that have has the tri karma
[02:03:50] when you do attack like it just does so
[02:03:52] much attack okay I see when you do
[02:03:54] spread oh my
[02:03:56] God okay I'm done to try
[02:04:00] this
[02:04:02] okay um wait so what team wait so I'll
[02:04:05] try an AFK team and then net finina and
[02:04:08] then who should be on the second because
[02:04:09] we're going to do ays too who should be
[02:04:10] on the second
[02:04:12] half I don't know we should i do6
[02:04:16] n oh yeah yeah so first team is going to
[02:04:18] weate okay wait oh the the AFK team how
[02:04:23] about this first team is going to be
[02:04:25] like AFK team but it's like a hybrid so
[02:04:27] that if you choose to do if you choose
[02:04:29] to play then you can use net if you want
[02:04:31] to AFK and just have Yik on the field
[02:04:35] okay yeah or wa but I was thinking what
[02:04:37] if I do only finina net my team no one
[02:04:41] else oh that sounds awesome as
[02:04:44] well wait what if I do wait better idea
[02:04:47] nalet one team for Arena the other no
[02:04:49] one
[02:04:50] else can they solo they probably that
[02:04:53] might actually work I actually think
[02:04:54] that work let's just do that and then we
[02:04:56] can try an actual team after yeah I
[02:04:59] think that would work ho
[02:05:00] crap okay I'm down dude what if he full
[02:05:04] star this I think we
[02:05:07] can C6 finina C6 never let there's no
[02:05:10] way we don't there's literally no way we
[02:05:12] don't this is actually cracked wait what
[02:05:14] about finina we want to change the
[02:05:15] artifacts for uh finina because she's
[02:05:18] not getting the B from the four piece uh
[02:05:22] yeah golden troop is still pretty good
[02:05:25] on C6 Arena but if we're on fi all the
[02:05:26] time Mar is better
[02:05:28] yeah oh I guess we can keep that it's
[02:05:30] C63 anyways it should
[02:05:34] work
[02:05:36] Weapon It's still skill damage
[02:05:39] right yeah it's their uh wait uh wait no
[02:05:44] it's
[02:05:47] not
[02:05:49] oh no wait you're
[02:05:51] [ __ ]
[02:05:54] wait is it its own scaling wait let me
[02:06:00] [Music]
[02:06:05] see wait wow you read really fast wait
[02:06:08] so this means we might need to wait do
[02:06:09] you want to get your talent to
[02:06:11] six oh dude I'm not so sure if I have
[02:06:14] the materials but sure uhoh yeah go
[02:06:17] ahead
[02:06:19] you don't need to level it it doesn't
[02:06:21] scale off for talent wait really oh okay
[02:06:23] I almost baited you it barely adds
[02:06:25] anything wait why does it if it's own
[02:06:27] scaling why wouldn't it say it there's
[02:06:29] no
[02:06:30] way own scaling T see it then it doesn't
[02:06:33] scale I guess no yeah it has to it does
[02:06:37] say it I'm getting one
[02:06:41] guide uh it just has hp% convert it to
[02:06:45] Hydro Bro I'm telling I'm saying if it
[02:06:48] has its own own scaling then it would
[02:06:50] say it's own scaling but it says
[02:06:51] increase which means it still [ __ ]
[02:06:53] scales on the normal attack level why
[02:06:55] are you getting why am I getting one
[02:06:57] guide okay okay okay you can use that I
[02:07:00] also have the
[02:07:01] whei I was screaming out chat
[02:07:05] you but I assume the noral like the I
[02:07:07] assume the town level doesn't matter
[02:07:08] that much cuz it's mostly on our HP and
[02:07:11] [ __ ] I mean true and also her goblet is
[02:07:14] HP as well
[02:07:16] so yeah like I assume the damage you're
[02:07:18] getting from said base normal attack is
[02:07:21] nothing okay fair enough maybe I'm
[02:07:23] getting one I I don't even know who's
[02:07:24] telling the truth
[02:07:32] anymore cuz it's not multip it's just
[02:07:34] literally added right damage is also
[02:07:35] increased by an amount equivalent to 80%
[02:07:37] of her Max
[02:07:38] HP I think it would be better if you
[02:07:40] just go into the spirit base and see how
[02:07:42] it goes because we're going to have to
[02:07:43] start with floor 9 first right wait why
[02:07:46] oh my God it reset yes okay let's just
[02:07:49] see how it goes
[02:07:51] yeah read this character is C6 chat you
[02:07:55] don't need to read anymore
[02:08:00] true okay
[02:08:03] cool try out on a random hilly TR I mean
[02:08:07] okay I mean yeah but that would requir
[02:08:09] leveling from one to two cuz You' have
[02:08:10] to test one and you test two like level
[02:08:15] mhm no no no just see if the damage is
[02:08:17] reasonable if not You Can level up I'm
[02:08:19] sure it'll be fine yeah it'll be fine
[02:08:21] with level one right I think it's going
[02:08:23] to be fine oh oh an nuet weapon R5 wait
[02:08:27] you actually want R5 it
[02:08:30] yeah do
[02:08:32] it are you sure
[02:08:37] yes you know I didn't save it up for the
[02:08:39] collaboration I just had it there and
[02:08:41] then I was like wait I'm just too strong

[02:09:40] mean that was predictable one I'm so
[02:09:42] glad I didn't see anything else wait but
[02:09:44] you you said it as I leveled to R5 so
[02:09:46] now how am I going to edit this let

[02:10:03] Fino what we're going to do we're going
[02:10:06] to solo each let me change her artifact
[02:10:07] set though let me put her on MAR okay
[02:10:09] okay
[02:10:10] okay
[02:10:12] um why does your magic show say worse
[02:10:15] wait never mind what the
[02:10:17] hell
[02:10:22] why do you have these
[02:10:25] pieces I'm still trying to find some
[02:10:27] better pieces some of these are cracked
[02:10:29] I mean okay this sound sucks
[02:10:32] but yeah because who uses mcely right
[02:10:38] now okay uh wait maybe maybe we do
[02:10:47] wait
[02:10:49] you have a good like you have you don't
[02:10:50] have a goblet which means we'd have to
[02:10:53] use this sand I kind of don't want to
[02:10:56] use the
[02:10:57] Sands oh oh what's another set I could
[02:11:00] use I I could still use Golden
[02:11:02] troop no I can't I mean just maybe we
[02:11:06] can just stick with oh n
[02:11:09] stream oh you can also use yeah n
[02:11:16] stream you can you can still Yan stuff
[02:11:19] if that's what you want but I think we
[02:11:21] have a cracked flower is it the feather
[02:11:24] those also gives a attack which is not
[02:11:26] great though but you get 15 Hydro damage
[02:11:28] 15 hydro which is like probably similar
[02:11:30] to I mean hard dep is charge normal
[02:11:33] charge right yeah could do hard depth I
[02:11:36] don't know if it's better though oh yeah
[02:11:38] Chad we're two guide makers on stream
[02:11:41] and we're
[02:11:42] having Weir thinking I mean Mar is the
[02:11:45] best I'm just not sure what we do subat
[02:11:47] wise maybe we just do 2v
[02:11:48] twoce yeah yeah just do I mean it should
[02:11:51] be fine without any set bonus I'm pretty
[02:11:54] sure but yeah but we need to we need to
[02:11:57] actually do good damage oh yeah yeah we
[02:12:00] can't be coping that
[02:12:03] much
[02:12:07] um what's your best
[02:12:10] cirquit best ciret they
[02:12:13] suck they do not suck oh we have
[02:12:16] something great we can use that one yeah
[02:12:20] Ito can get benched okay fine he's using
[02:12:23] noil Clipper right now
[02:12:25] so um you have a good HP SS on let's
[02:12:31] see sorry for the gearing
[02:12:43] um this is pretty good we'll do to hard
[02:12:46] of depth
[02:12:53] stop typing B gearing is not
[02:12:58] B okay we're going to do these pieces
[02:13:00] look fine wa let's see yeah 89 252 we
[02:13:05] have like no ER but that's fine
[02:13:08] 35p yeah you don't need ER if you kill
[02:13:10] them okay that's
[02:13:12] true level one normal attack I'm down
[02:13:16] let's try it okay
[02:13:20] um anything
[02:13:22] else we should talk about or should I
[02:13:25] just go test
[02:13:30] it oh um wait I think that's it is there
[02:13:34] anything you want to ask me oh uh didn't
[02:13:37] you just say you wanted to know why I
[02:13:40] have like C6 on certain characters and
[02:13:42] whatnot yeah yeah actually yeah yeah
[02:13:44] yeah why is soo why is Sino c0 we're
[02:13:47] beefing right now okay first of all who
[02:13:50] cares about Soo just kidding I like Soo
[02:13:53] when he came out I saw big potential out
[02:13:55] of him right but he's still not the best
[02:13:59] let's be honest he's not the best even
[02:14:01] after naha came out like he's still not
[02:14:03] the best but I still like him it's very
[02:14:05] fun to play around with him because you
[02:14:07] know just like net I like greedy DPS on
[02:14:10] field okay I want to stay on field you
[02:14:13] know after national team got you know
[02:14:15] became really famous in na server right
[02:14:18] everyone started doing quick swap teams
[02:14:20] and I was like what is this you know but
[02:14:24] uh well you know Hoover started giving
[02:14:28] out media server to everyone to try out
[02:14:30] characters with C6 like that was my
[02:14:33] thing back in the day I would always
[02:14:35] Veil for a character and I'll make them
[02:14:37] C6 R5 and that was the reason why one of
[02:14:40] the reasons why people watched me right
[02:14:42] but when everyone started doing that I
[02:14:44] was like ah maybe I should become a
[02:14:45] little more selective about spending
[02:14:48] money in G impact you know so I chose
[02:14:51] all the characters that I liked and then
[02:14:53] C6 them and um well and also at the also
[02:14:57] at the same time I found out that R1 is
[02:14:59] just good
[02:15:01] enough yeah yeah I mean you don't need
[02:15:03] to yeah you know I get that you can also
[02:15:06] do like viewer pulls or viewer accounts
[02:15:07] if you want to like try C6 and don't
[02:15:09] like want to Ah that's actually big
