[00:45:02] maybe three levels but
[00:45:06] still
[00:45:09] anyways
[00:45:12] uh oh yeah we're going to
[00:45:16] pull D my uh wait let me actually I
[00:45:20] don't need to make a team setup
[00:45:22] actually no I don't but I'm going to put
[00:45:24] my
[00:45:28] I'll make
[00:45:31] one we're probably going to play this
[00:45:33] exact team but we're going to bench and
[00:45:34] see also let me level Verina I didn't
[00:45:36] want to cuz [ __ ] Vina but we'll level
[00:45:37] her cuz she's broken to bloom time to
[00:45:40] bloom I didn't realize I was holding my
[00:45:43] breath look okay so
[00:45:50] beautiful and pause my actually let me
[00:45:53] just change FL lists dude okay no joke I
[00:45:57] was looking at the Chang Le a
[00:46:00] lot I've seen some heated arguments of
[00:46:03] people being
[00:46:06] like okay I don't
[00:46:10] know I I
[00:46:13] I we'll get her in a second but I think
[00:46:16] she's um I think she's like kind of hard
[00:46:19] to play well so I might have skill
[00:46:22] issues so don't take my gameplay as the
[00:46:24] Holy Bible
[00:46:27] but I think she's
[00:46:29] like um you can swap cancel like
[00:46:32] literally everything and I think you're
[00:46:34] supposed to swap cancel like literally
[00:46:36] everything so I think the average Andy
[00:46:39] is going to think she's a lot worse than
[00:46:41] she
[00:46:42] is but she's not as broken as jiny like
[00:46:45] jiny's broken she's probably
[00:46:48] like right under jiny and GN I
[00:46:53] think anyways
[00:47:02] anyways she's not a DPS question mark I
[00:47:05] I think people use the term DPS and sub
[00:47:07] DPS when they're too stupid to realize
[00:47:09] that there's Nu on like okay I used it
[00:47:11] too so I'm stupid caught but like it
[00:47:13] it's like you are a DPS but you're I
[00:47:15] think I don't think you're like basic
[00:47:16] attacking like I think you basic attack
[00:47:18] after like your intro skill like you you
[00:47:20] basic attack to get your like true thing
[00:47:23] sometimes but usually like after the
[00:47:25] intro but usually it's more beneficial
[00:47:28] to
[00:47:29] like like let's say scar comes out and
[00:47:31] Scar's Fusion you would rather be on
[00:47:34] scar than be on Chang Le but Chang Le
[00:47:36] Buffs him and also does good really good
[00:47:40] like burst hits of damage but then if
[00:47:42] you have to stay on her longer than that
[00:47:44] kind of like Havoc Rover it's like Havoc
[00:47:46] Rover can do Basics but you kind of
[00:47:47] don't want
[00:47:51] to well that's not true I mean I mean
[00:47:53] you do want to it's not like you don't
[00:47:55] want to but it's like if you have better
[00:47:56] things to do then you have better things
[00:47:57] to do like it's not like it's yeah so I
[00:48:01] kind of like using her with
[00:48:03] yinin
[00:48:05] because I mean I don't know yet like we
[00:48:07] don't have her but I I I kind of think
[00:48:09] I'm going to like using her with yland
[00:48:10] or uh
[00:48:14] Encore and no for the record now that
[00:48:17] it's been long enough I think jinc is
[00:48:18] like turbo broken and like CH changle is
[00:48:22] good I don't think she's broken I think
[00:48:24] she's just good she's like pretty good
[00:48:28] Jin's [ __ ]
[00:48:34] broken all right time to pull we have 14
[00:48:38] 10 dude look
[00:48:39] at I have 30 standards for no reason I
[00:48:43] don't even want them
[00:48:45] but we'll do we'll do three uh standard
[00:48:48] temples too just for fun chat mods can
[00:48:50] we get a gamble going on if I'll um

[01:17:06] it's fine um but I don't think I want

[01:33:02] look at how many of these you can my
[01:33:03] face Cam's covering it but look at how
[01:33:05] many of these things I have like I
[01:33:06] actually like when
[01:33:12] ham okay this is
[01:33:14] fine uh I could make another I could
[01:33:16] level another thing
[01:33:35] do I have to do
[01:33:39] math like
[01:33:41] 2.6 *
[01:33:44] 5
[01:33:46] 30
[01:33:49] like 30 was 30
[01:33:55] 40 plus
[01:33:57] 40 but this one you use twice per this
[01:33:59] one so it's probably
[01:34:01] like it's probably Forte they're
[01:34:03] probably about the same though H rese
[01:34:06] cration looks cooler though but it's
[01:34:07] probably
[01:34:13] Forte
[01:34:15] okay make it
[01:34:18] fast all right we're done okay so for
[01:34:21] now oh my God wait I didn't unlock the

[01:34:26] that in a bit I'll get that in a bit but
[01:34:28] like let's say you add that crit rate up
[01:34:29] to our total crit rate we're at like 70
[01:34:33] uh 240 which is basically 140 so it's
[01:34:36] pretty good it's pretty
[01:34:38] good we're e zero I mean sorry S zero on
[01:34:42] the standard

[01:38:16] about the CR wi yeah you got scammed
[01:38:18] buddy nice
[01:38:20] try sorry sorry I will play it I will
[01:38:22] play it I will play it
[01:38:25] maybe I go Tower
[01:38:30] to okay I'll add it to Q the [ __ ] was it
[01:38:34] called I don't even know what they're
[01:38:35] called
[01:38:44] [Music]
[01:39:01] okay no disrespect though cuz I don't
[01:39:03] want to upset anyone but getting me to
[01:39:05] listen to Indie is not a good
[01:39:07] idea but it's okay I added it to Q
[01:39:09] although dropping started playing first
[01:39:11] so I'm
[01:39:13] sorry all right anyways
[01:39:17] um wait okay yo low key thoughts okay
[01:39:20] thoughts on the yo give me a Content
[01:39:21] meter rate this on the boom meter
[01:39:24] on the content scale of what if I go uh
[01:39:27] Farm some improved Rings dude I okay
[01:39:30] honestly though I kill like every enemy
[01:39:33] I see because I want Echoes but Exiles
[01:39:35] don't drop Echoes so I unironically like
[01:39:38] Perma skip them like it's one of the
[01:39:40] only enemies I always
[01:39:45] skip so I feel like it's normal not to
[01:39:48] have rings
[01:39:59] wait what the [ __ ] did it just
[01:40:05] say MCU donated $1 lost my preschool
[01:40:10] tuition for
[01:40:12] this you didn't you didn't lose any
[01:40:14] tuition
[01:40:24] I mean honestly what if I just say [ __ ]
[01:40:26] five crit rate and I just do
[01:40:29] it no
[01:40:31] mercy well I probably shouldn't waste my
[01:40:34] wait no actually it doesn't
[01:40:37] matter on
[01:40:44] Boss but CH is cool um Ian I haven't
[01:40:47] really like properly played her yet Sask
[01:40:51] but
[01:40:56] like I'm pretty sure literally all of
[01:40:57] her animations uh okay well that guy
[01:41:00] died did I get rings I wasn't looking
[01:41:02] probably um like like almost all of our
[01:41:05] animations are like swap cancelable
[01:41:06] which is pretty
[01:41:08] cool you do this this and then I
[01:41:12] misclicked but I could have done that
[01:41:13] earlier
[01:41:19] but actually I wonder how early I could
[01:41:21] do it let me wait
[01:41:24] oh yeah that's early as
[01:41:26] [ __ ] that's like really early wa let me
[01:41:29] try with the well skill you want you're
[01:41:31] in true state after so you don't want to
[01:41:32] like skill and then swap you could skill
[01:41:34] and then basic and then swap so you do
[01:41:35] this this and then basic yeah that's
[01:41:38] really [ __ ] fast I probably should
[01:41:40] record that but yeah okay cool and then
[01:41:42] here you do that that one
[01:41:45] two yeah okay you did two Basics after
[01:41:47] your
[01:41:49] intro
[01:41:51] okay sure
[01:41:53] yeah I will make a video for Chang Le
[01:41:59] broccoli up
[01:42:01] swing the language $1 have you ever
[01:42:05] considered doing an abyss challenge
[01:42:07] where you're being distracted D like
[01:42:10] while eating something spicy or while
[01:42:12] someone is tickling you okay I'm not
[01:42:14] going to have someone tickle me while I
[01:42:15] do the abyss you guys know that like the
[01:42:18] the like Japanese game show okay I I
[01:42:20] only saw a clip of it but like you know
[01:42:22] how it's like
[01:42:24] like okay but imagine that but like for
[01:42:28] um but like you're doing the
[01:42:32] abyss you're playing like
[01:42:39] Alam if I come I
[01:42:41] roll okay
[01:42:50] sorry you can do with wa too
[01:43:06] wait the true form whatever the [ __ ]
[01:43:07] it's called stays after you swap right
[01:43:09] wait let me see boom
[01:43:13] boom yeah it does right all right
[01:43:26] no I uh for the Holograms like they're
[01:43:29] lowkey my favorite content but I've only
[01:43:31] done all like the fives cuz like I was
[01:43:33] like low level and then I was like oh
[01:43:34] I'll just stream the sixes but then I've
[01:43:36] just been playing off stream so I just
[01:43:38] haven't streamed it
[01:43:40] but I mean I assume we can now it
[01:43:42] shouldn't be hard well it might be hard
[01:43:44] but like it shouldn't be like
[01:43:49] impossible okay wait one sec okay I hope
[01:43:52] I don't lag but let me record background
[01:43:54] footage really fast actually I'll
[01:43:56] probably do that in Tower
[01:43:58] actually let me turn this off so I can
[01:44:00] hear
[01:44:08] it
[01:44:12] guys
[01:44:18] [Music]
[01:44:20] ow oh [ __ ] I didn't mean the intro skill
[01:44:23] wait I [ __ ] up
[01:44:29] whatever let me go to Tower really
[01:44:31] quick
[01:44:36] Tower how do you find characters local
[01:44:38] Specialties uh buy them at the pharmacy
[01:44:41] no but there's an interactive map you
[01:44:43] can look up if you care for Chang Le and
[01:44:45] jiny there's like an event that gives
[01:44:46] you a [ __ ] ton so you don't need to farm
[01:44:48] that
[01:44:52] many okay hopefully I don't die I
[01:44:54] literally just want to showcase
[01:44:55] something I might [ __ ] die
[01:45:12] though okay that's one and then there's
[01:45:15] let me not
[01:45:18] die no dude it's been a while I haven't
[01:45:21] fought this guy in [ __ ] Forever Wait
[01:45:22] so
[01:45:30] uh what do I want to do this
[01:45:34] this wait
[01:45:42] I
[01:45:47] ow okay I get it now sorry I was
[01:45:51] thinking we clear this as well I think I
[01:45:54] think we can clear this but not right
[01:45:55] now but I think we will uh one
[01:46:01] second [ __ ] and cool down no I
[01:46:14] thought it's definitely not worth
[01:46:16] swapping after your e though I mean I
[01:46:17] still have my thing it's fine but the
[01:46:19] the true side's worth swap cancelling
[01:46:21] the skill kind of isn't ow what the
[01:46:23] [ __ ] ow dude stop hitting
[01:46:28] me okay I
[01:46:30] died okay yeah I think I think the skill
[01:46:32] is not worth canceling but the the the
[01:46:34] both true sides are and the heavy attack
[01:46:36] is but not your first heavy attack cuz
[01:46:38] if you heavy attack you can Al and then
[01:46:39] heavy attack again you can do
[01:46:42] this and then this and then you can swap
[01:46:47] instantly and then whatever the [ __ ] you
[01:46:49] want
[01:46:55] and then like this this that and you can
[01:46:57] swap out
[01:47:00] instantly so like let's I do boom boom
[01:47:04] then boom and then I swap and then yeah
[01:47:06] she does
[01:47:08] that okay noted let me get an intro
[01:47:10] skill really fast oh I might get hit by
[01:47:12] that yeah I whatever
[01:47:14] that that and
[01:47:17] then wait no that's not what I wanted to
[01:47:19] do let me get my outro skill actually
[01:47:24] I should still be in TR side now when I
[01:47:25] saw back in yeah I was and then you can
[01:47:28] do
[01:47:32] this wait did
[01:47:34] those wa I didn't know that
[01:47:39] works wait can you do heavy attack into
[01:47:41] alt and both go through
[01:47:51] Tech wait that's [ __ ] insane M

[01:48:23] that is your
[01:48:31] Liberation okay
[01:48:33] sorry also it's okay yeah I
[01:48:37] know um I think that's all I wanted to
[01:48:39] do here that's fine I think that's all I
[01:48:41] wanted to do here we can like actually
[01:48:42] fight it later
[01:48:51] but I guess you could do that but
[01:48:54] then oh yeah she's dead no no don't kill
[01:48:59] me no okay all right all good let me uh
[01:49:05] get that really

[01:49:53] dude is anyone else okay I don't know if
[01:49:55] this is just me this might
[01:49:56] be a rare take but I I I feel like
[01:49:59] whenever I open like literally every
[01:50:02] time I open Google drive it defaults to
[01:50:04] a random Google account I don't use and
[01:50:06] then I always have to swap Google
[01:50:07] accounts to the one I actually do use or
[01:50:10] I accidentally upload on the wrong one
[01:50:11] and then I'm cooked why does that

[01:50:46] remember yeah okay so like I have like
[01:50:49] my YouTube account or like my normal
[01:50:51] Gmail that I use but then when I go to
[01:50:52] drive it pulls that one up but that one
[01:50:54] is not the same as the one that I want
[01:50:56] for Drive is that my fault doesn't it
[01:50:59] doesn't sound like it

[01:51:40] learn just let's just put it like that
[01:51:42] look maybe I will like if I care I'll
[01:51:44] learn but I don't know if I care are the
[01:51:47] other nine males for the nine different
[01:51:49] League accounts so you can flame someone
[01:51:51] successfully uh it was more okay so a
[01:51:54] lot of them used to be for OverWatch cuz
[01:51:56] when I would play with my
[01:51:58] friends I I I don't know they would like
[01:52:01] I needed to play with my friends and
[01:52:02] they were like [ __ ] piss low all good
[01:52:05] like no disrespect
[01:52:07] um but now I have a bunch for like
[01:52:09] different things like I don't just Chuck

[01:52:12] email so
[01:52:21] yeah Smurf okay it wasn't even smurfing
[01:52:23] it was like an ELO that's similar to
[01:52:25] mine I just don't want to throw or
[01:52:27] they're like slightly lower but it's
[01:52:29] like a six stack so it's like way harder
[01:52:31] games
[01:52:34] anyways like I think I had a 40% win
[01:52:37] rate like it wasn't like a it wasn't
[01:52:39] like we were
[01:52:46] winning no like I have like 70% on oh no
[01:52:49] no not 70 I like like 56 on my main
[01:52:52] which is good cuz like 500 games or more
[01:52:55] but like with with my friends it was
[01:52:57] like it was definitely negative so if
[01:52:59] anything I was like reverse smurfing
[01:53:01] like I was like like yeah I was just
[01:53:05] cooked no that was years ago though that
[01:53:07] was that wasn't now that was years
[01:53:13] ago I haven't played that game in

[02:23:21] I'm not confident enough but I know that
[02:23:23] when you intro skill you could just do
[02:23:24] the the air thing and then you start at
[02:23:25] n two cuz like you intro skill you do
[02:23:27] the thing in air and then you plunge

[03:21:50] account all right we'll put that in
[03:21:51] copium free to-play
[03:21:53] account okay the thing is I actually was
[03:21:56] down to and I still am but if I'm
[03:21:58] playing like 72 gacha games at once I'm
[03:22:00] [ __ ] [ __ ] man but like maybe in the
[03:22:03] future we'll have like like we we'll
[03:22:04] send like one or two of the games we
[03:22:06] play to the second Channel and then I
[03:22:08] can just focus on like one or two and
[03:22:09] then it should be fine
[03:22:20] quit HSR I don't want to I'm actually
[03:22:23] hyped for the new March I still play HR
[03:22:26] is Chill because it takes like no time
[03:22:27] it's just hard to stream it for
[03:22:29] me but maybe I was thinking for HSR I
[03:22:32] might uh like I'll just like I'll
[03:22:35] probably just second Channel video most
[03:22:36] of them like the new March and stuff are
[03:22:38] going to be second Channel maybe second
[03:22:40] half character Sask the chef dude s well
[03:22:43] yeah they showed the halves right yeah
[03:22:44] Suk might be a main Channel video not
[03:22:47] sure yet
[03:22:57] though
[03:23:01] clueless
[03:23:08] anyways I'd ra rather watch Clara to
[03:23:11] okay but the thing with Clara 2 is like
[03:23:13] my eyes deceive me and Elden ring is on
[03:23:15] the list eldering is right here your
[03:23:17] eyes do toce you is the first thing
[03:23:20] um the thing with uh claraa 2 is like
[03:23:24] she's very soon so I could still like I
[03:23:27] I'll definitely make a second Channel
[03:23:28] video for her so her and
[03:23:29] March um however because she's so soon
[03:23:34] that means that the like early content
[03:23:36] stuff is probably going to be out soon
[03:23:37] which means I'm not like going to try
[03:23:41] hard to be like Rush everything so I'll
[03:23:42] probably just do it when she's out and
[03:23:44] just play it on stream and stuff
[03:23:47] but if I want to be early it'll be for
[03:23:48] another character or for 5 I'm trying to
[03:23:51] be ready for like the G
[03:23:53] stuff and then we just [ __ ] post play
[03:23:56] Star when the character's live and then
[03:23:58] second Channel video it just for
[03:24:01] fun react to viewers Spotify you you
[03:24:04] guys have the worst taste I'm
[03:24:09] sorry okay anyways sorry I'm a bit dead
[03:24:12] right now Chad I'm going to be home
[03:24:13] literally tomorrow and then we're going
