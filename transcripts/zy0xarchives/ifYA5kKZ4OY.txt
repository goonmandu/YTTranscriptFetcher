[01:51:43] good I mean all damage is good I don't
[01:51:46] really want a minus 50 so [ __ ] it uh
[01:51:48] additional damage after the character
[01:51:50] use an attack they deal additional
[01:51:51] damage Target for every enemy that was
[01:51:53] attacked increase the damage by
[01:51:56] 15% you know
[01:51:58] what

[02:12:58] weep doesn't sound like a version filled
[02:13:01] with sunshine and rainbows don't get too
[02:13:05] hasty
[02:13:06] now After experiencing two versions of
[02:13:09] pentacon I'm sure everybody is eager to
[02:13:11] uncover the truth behind the sweet dream
[02:13:15] since miss the family screen in clock
[02:13:18] studi theme park it's obvious VI things
[02:13:21] aren't quite as safe as the family made
[02:13:24] them out to be did anyone really believe
[02:13:28] them in the first
[02:13:30] place no meanwhile seem to be heading in
[02:13:34] a more favorable direction for Mr
[02:13:37] aventurine there's a secret within the
[02:13:40] family that goes deeper than any murder
[02:13:43] mystery but I mean we knew that but the
[02:13:46] clues we have so far things don't really
[02:13:50] add up no we knew dude the second you
[02:13:51] met the family you're like okay Su it's
[02:13:54] not spoilers example Firefly and I were
[02:13:58] attacked when we came to our senses we
[02:14:01] didn't have a single
[02:14:03] scratch what happened
[02:14:05] exactly you know Dr ratio once told me
[02:14:09] that in a Dream It's not that's
[02:14:13] impossible but
[02:14:15] dormy h a thought-provoking idea and let
[02:14:20] me remind you
[02:14:21] heo deciphered a secret passage in the
[02:14:23] invitation to the charmony festival
[02:14:26] witness The Impossible in the realm of
[02:14:28] Dreams find the legacy of the watchmaker
[02:14:31] father of pentacon and thus the answer
[02:14:34] to the question why does life Slumber so
[02:14:38] in other words you need to enter an
[02:14:40] impossible
[02:14:42] dorcy within a
[02:14:44] dream only then can you pull back the
[02:14:47] curtain and get closer to the watch
[02:14:49] Maker's Legacy
[02:14:51] torcy within a
[02:14:54] dream is that like a dream within a
[02:14:58] dream I think there's another
[02:15:01] possibility could it be referring to the
[02:15:04] other side of the
[02:15:06] dream just like Miss akaran said at the
[02:15:09] end of version 2.1 yeah I remember pone
[02:15:13] the true land of the
[02:15:16] Exiles on that note perhaps we could
[02:15:19] uncover some clues in version 2 . 2's
[02:15:21] new maap dream flux that looks sick can
[02:15:25] anyone guess what the connection might
[02:15:26] be
[02:15:28] H taking the name at face value it's a
[02:15:32] reef that the Dreamscape flows past if
[02:15:35] the Dreamscape can flow G me cyberpunk
[02:15:37] Vibes but I haven't seen enough of it
[02:15:39] yet should be flowing
[02:15:40] downhill could there really be a deeper
[02:15:43] level to the Dreamscape could there
[02:15:47] indeed Trailblazers will have to
[02:15:49] discover the truth for themselves
[02:15:51] all I can reveal is that entering this
[02:15:53] special domain will require Ways and
[02:15:56] Means okay in version 2.2 we'll do that
[02:15:59] day one Quest day one Always Rings Twice
[02:16:02] traes will head day two after like Robin
[02:16:05] or whatever unexpected friends and let's
[02:16:08] not forget the charm wi Festival has
[02:16:10] also entered the countdown phase the
[02:16:13] curtain will soon rise before guests
[02:16:15] from across the cosmos H the charmony
[02:16:19] festival the family's guaranteed
[02:16:21] security has fallen to
[02:16:24] pieces still they've done a good job

[02:18:35] overtime I could attend
[02:18:37] myself TR that be cool I'll be there
[02:18:41] performance don't mess it up
[02:18:45] now another thing in the scene we just
[02:18:48] saw what were all those Strang looking
[02:18:52] characters in the theater watch who
[02:18:54] you're calling Strang looking those are
[02:18:56] official Charmy Festival
[02:18:59] Personnel after all the opening ceremony
[02:19:02] is just around the corner there's still
[02:19:04] a lot of preparation to do well they're
[02:19:06] unique I'll give them that it seems like
[02:19:09] some of them are holding glasses and
[02:19:12] others are
[02:19:14] carrying oh my those are violin balls
[02:19:18] the members of the sweet dreams Troop
[02:19:20] and also can we talk about the art like
[02:19:23] I try not to say anything but like they
[02:19:26] look a little on edge uh perhaps they
[02:19:30] won the final of the auditions stage
[02:19:33] fright is serious you know wait I
[02:19:36] thought the Trailblazer was supposed to
[02:19:38] win director Adventure what about it
[02:19:41] it's just cool there's nothing wrong
[02:19:42] with it just cool let's just say that
[02:19:45] anything is
[02:19:48] possible next let's introduce the
[02:19:50] leading roles who will feature at
[02:19:53] leading roles me oh Robin all right pay
[02:19:58] attention
[02:20:01] Okay that's cute music
[02:20:05] note oh my y so loud oh my
[02:20:13] God firstly we have singer Robin whose
[02:20:17] Beauty and talent are known throughout
[02:20:19] the cosm I mean we know this I'm sure
[02:20:21] miss Robin is no stranger to our viewers
[02:20:24] her gentle Elegance as a singer has
[02:20:26] earned her countless fans from a cross
[02:20:29] dude imagine if every Al she starts
[02:20:30] singing and then you hear it over and
[02:20:32] over and over and over and over still
[02:20:33] have plenty to improve on oh don't be so
[02:20:36] modest and just so you know Miss Robin
[02:20:39] I'm a fan too I've got so many
[02:20:42] collector's edition vinyls I don't know
[02:20:44] where to put them whenever I'm up
[02:20:46] burning the midnight oil your singing
[02:20:48] sues my weary soul the voice is soft as
[02:20:53] a FEA I appreciate the Fanfare Mr Albert
[02:20:57] okay but do you think maybe you're
[02:21:00] overworking yourself oh don't
[02:21:03] worry the opportunity to see you I like
[02:21:05] her color palette is worth all the
[02:21:07] overtime in the world you're certainly
[02:21:10] worthy of the Limelight miss Robin but I
[02:21:13] can't help but feel that you're a bird
[02:21:16] in a cage or perhaps I should say he is
[02:21:19] a an owl someone who's ready to spread
[02:21:23] their wings so funny you're the best
[02:21:27] sometimes every bird is trapped in a
[02:21:29] cage yearning to fly free and soar into
[02:21:33] the all right owlbert we get the idea no
[02:21:37] back to Business from The Letter miss
[02:21:40] Robin gave to Mr Sunday we learned that
[02:21:43] during the preparations for the festival
[02:21:45] she was the first to notice anomalies in
[02:21:47] pentacon and began to invate the traitor
[02:21:50] in the
[02:21:51] in the process she suffered an accident
[02:21:53] and became a victim of death but seeing
[02:21:57] how Firefly has reunited with the
[02:22:00] Trailblazer I'm sure that death isn't
[02:22:04] the end of the story for
[02:22:07] her secrets are sure to unfold in the
[02:22:10] 2.2 story but for now let's take a look
[02:22:13] at Miss Robins battle cred stop tying
[02:22:15] spoiler sh I did the quest okay let's
[02:22:17] see what Robin does let's see what Robin
[02:22:18] does well I'm a physical type character
[02:22:20] character following the path of Harmony
[02:22:23] my technique allows me to create a
[02:22:24] dimension around myself any en fuet
[02:22:29] follow me without attacking after
[02:22:31] entering battle against enemies in the
[02:22:32] dimension I can also regenerate
[02:22:35] additional energy even enemies are
[02:22:37] captivated by miss Robin
[02:22:41] status my forte is working in sync with
[02:22:44] my team offering support and Buffs to
[02:22:47] everyone Pi my skill
[02:22:50] which ences the total damage inflicted
[02:22:53] by her team or my talent which allows me
[02:22:56] to regenerate additional energy whenever
[02:22:58] my allies attack enemies and as a cosmic
[02:23:01] songstress miss Robin also integrates
[02:23:04] her songs into combat when using her
[02:23:07] ultimate miss Robin belts out a morale
[02:23:09] boosting number and enters a
[02:23:11] performative state this state allows all
[02:23:14] allies to immediately take action while
[02:23:16] also providing Buffs everyone
[02:23:19] immediately takes action again I like
[02:23:21] this song Robin is full of surpris but I
[02:23:23] feel like it's going to get rep song now
[02:23:26] that's a two it's going to be great the
[02:23:28] first like day but I feel like in like a
[02:23:31] week two weeks lifting Spirits when my
[02:23:33] ultimate is in play I inflict additional
[02:23:36] damage on the
[02:23:37] enemy attack plus I'm immune to crowd
[02:23:42] control debuffs immune to crowd control
[02:23:44] debuffs you fully embody the path of
[02:23:47] Harmony Miss Robin spreading Harmony has
[02:23:51] always been my mission as a lovian I
[02:23:54] have the innate ability to transmit
[02:23:56] feelings and resonate energy through my
[02:23:59] halo which aligns perfectly with my path
[02:24:02] okay that's song Team there other ways
[02:24:04] to access it I mean we can't be asking
[02:24:07] you to go into battle every time we want
[02:24:09] to hear it as a matter of fact our
[02:24:12] audience is also very curious about Miss

[02:28:30] already I'm grateful for all the support
[02:28:33] to accompany the album why is it so
[02:28:35] quiet now a Creator invite web event
[02:28:38] which aims to gather lovely Melodies
[02:28:40] from all over the
[02:28:43] cosmos okay now that we've introduced
[02:28:46] miss Robin the next individual stay Boot
[02:28:49] Hill there's none other than Boot
[02:29:02] Hill yo why are his legs so long you
[02:29:06] have a gun you don't need to kick him
[02:29:09] okay that's pretty
[02:29:12] cool okay it's [ __ ] High
[02:29:15] Noon it's High Noon
[02:29:20] and of version 2.1 we heard this
[02:29:22] mysterious visitor's voice I think he
[02:29:24] looks better without his hat hopefully
[02:29:25] he can remove it probably
[02:29:27] not Dar his way over who is this
[02:29:32] booill where does he come from glad you
[02:29:35] asked allow me to introduce him booill
[02:29:39] is a galaxy ranger with a pretty unique
[02:29:42] turn of phrase like muddle fudger son of
[02:29:46] a nice
[02:29:49] lady aside from being a galaxy ranger
[02:29:52] Boot Hill is also a wild and
[02:29:54] unpredictable Interstellar Cowboy a
[02:29:57] regular on the ipc's Winer list even so
[02:30:01] there's talk that he also helped to
[02:30:03] resolve several serious incidents okay
[02:30:07] sounds like he's someone who plays both
[02:30:09] sides skirting the line between good and
[02:30:13] evil
[02:30:15] precisely however this dangerous
[02:30:18] gunslinging cowboy
[02:30:20] was put in his place at penton's Ry
[02:30:22] hotel when the front Des told him he
[02:30:25] couldn't check in gy Ranger I think I
[02:30:30] know why he wasn't allowed to stay oh
[02:30:32] because paniconi already had another
[02:30:34] galaxy ranger checked in someone I play
[02:30:38] Both Sides too what do you mean by that
[02:30:40] situation that's why Boot Hill decided
[02:30:42] to visit the astral Express hoping to
[02:30:45] get some help from the nameless I see
[02:30:49] but aren't Don Hong and pom pom the only
[02:30:52] ones currently on board the express can
[02:30:54] we get himo back in the express what's
[02:30:56] going to
[02:31:01] happen Albert's favorite part of the
[02:31:03] show not telling us stuff not
[02:31:07] true let's take a look at what Bo Hill
[02:31:10] can do on the battlefield all me I'm
[02:31:12] Cowboy roaming the Galaxy Boot Hill has
[02:31:14] his own combat philosophy he targets a
[02:31:17] single enemy with his skill and initiate
[02:31:19] creates a duel during the duel Boot Hill
[02:31:22] taunts the enemy thereby enhancing his
[02:31:24] own basic attack both parties in the
[02:31:27] duel suffer increased damage from each
[02:31:29] other he takes it okay the duel I might
[02:31:32] need you might need a Happ in the movies
[02:31:35] Boot Hill prefers a straightforward
[02:31:36] approach to resolving conflicts and this
[02:31:39] is reflected in his talent every time a
[02:31:42] dual Target is defeated or their
[02:31:43] weakness is broken Boot Hill gains a
[02:31:46] stackable enhancement when Boot Hill
[02:31:48] uses his ultimate he inflicts physical
[02:31:51] weakness on the enemy damage and delays
[02:31:54] the target's action nice he just chucked
[02:31:56] the weakness on them cinematic
[02:31:58] ultimate there's even a picture of the
[02:32:00] enemy on the wanted poster sick walking
[02:32:02] onto the Target and striking with
[02:32:05] Precision such a dashing Cowboy Bo
[02:32:09] Hill's technique allows him to inflict
[02:32:11] physical weakness on the enemy the first
[02:32:13] time he silver wolf players and shbl is
[02:32:16] this the power of a G nation rise the
[02:32:20] power of beating them at their own game
[02:32:22] tromping in duels makes boot Hills
[02:32:25] stronger and annihilating enemies leads
[02:32:27] to an overpowering evolution problems
[02:32:30] are dispatched in no time and by
[02:32:34] problems you mean people who present
[02:32:37] problems right same difference when
[02:32:40] you're on every other Wanted list you've
[02:32:42] got to get things done by hook why isn't
[02:32:44] Bo Hill on the couch or the bench
[02:32:46] whatever it is couch so being a c boy
[02:32:50] and all does Boot Hill order milk when
[02:32:53] he's at the
[02:32:55] bar uh I think you've taken the cow part
[02:32:59] too literally M uh I don't think Cowboys
[02:33:02] drink milk mice is more his but is it
[02:33:05] Mal bad for you well the ipc's files
[02:33:08] suggests that booill is prone to
[02:33:10] augmenting his fighting skills with
[02:33:11] invasive mechanical
[02:33:14] upgrades for someone that's 90% machine
[02:33:17] I'd say malt juice is the least of his
[02:33:20] concerns moving swiftly on aside from
[02:33:24] the two characters we've already
[02:33:25] introduced there's another special guest
[02:33:27] in version 2.2 one who's set to give a
[02:33:31] spectacular performance charm Festival
[02:33:34] please be normal it's the one and only
[02:33:36] Harmon I don't want YouTube comments
[02:33:38] complaining about you again be
[02:33:41] normal no please you P
[02:33:47] CH my goat
[02:33:52] [Music]
[02:33:55] wait I predicted this not really
[02:34:00] but I said we'd get a up Chen boss fight
[02:34:03] we got it star let's go performing at
[02:34:04] the charm Festival that enemy looks sick
[02:34:06] though actually looks sick are we sure
[02:34:08] they're not aiming to sabotage the
[02:34:13] festival well that depends on who you're
[02:34:15] teaming up with good thing our
[02:34:17] Trailblazer is an adaptable individual
[02:34:21] to ensure this show goes off without a
[02:34:23] hitch I brought along some detailed
[02:34:25] Intel on harmonious Choir The Great
[02:34:29] Septimus once in harmonious Choir The
[02:34:33] Great Septimus charges and unleashes
[02:34:36] semic chorus which allows all of its
[02:34:38] active summons to inflict damage on a
[02:34:41] single Ally that's really cool in the
[02:34:43] second phase of battle after charging up
[02:34:45] the great Septimus uses chorus dealing
[02:34:48] damage to all allies plus all of the
[02:34:52] great Septimus active summons will also
[02:34:54] deal extra damage to all allies I
[02:34:57] screenshot that during the second phase
[02:34:59] the great Septimus cast a shield on
[02:35:01] themselves decreasing the damage they
[02:35:03] take and boosting the damage they cause
[02:35:06] to all allies while making their own
[02:35:08] toughest impervious no disrespect to
[02:35:10] this boss fight is but it's giving me
[02:35:12] the Vibes of the first weekly boss with
[02:35:14] the hands and that was the most annoying
[02:35:15] one for me to clear when I started play
[02:35:17] it so it wasn't hard it was so annoying
[02:35:19] unleashing defense ignoring attacks that
[02:35:22] deal massive damage to all allies okay
[02:35:24] we just got meteored nice a challenging
[02:35:28] adversary
[02:35:30] indeed y do we think Tik tok's going to
[02:35:32] complain about this tricks we can use to
[02:35:34] defeat it during battle Trailblazers
[02:35:36] need to quickly Target and break the
[02:35:38] weaknesses of the great Septimus and its
[02:35:40] summons guys this boss is impossible are
[02:35:43] broken the great Septimus won't be able
[02:35:45] to use its semic chorus ability and the
[02:35:48] strength of chorus will be sign
[02:35:49] significantly reduced breaking the great
[02:35:52] weakness will also Grant a shared Shield
[02:35:54] to all allies okay cool now that I think
[02:35:58] about it this version's promotional
[02:36:01] artwork gave some pretty strong hints on
[02:36:04] all this I
[02:36:05] see it seems that this was meant to be
[02:36:08] the traon festival's main act all along
[02:36:12] oh poor
[02:36:13] Trailblazers did you think you were
[02:36:15] coming to paniconi for a vacation is
[02:36:18] this what people mean when they say

[02:39:45] at sorry no doality welcome back
[02:39:48] everyone time to dive straight into
[02:39:51] version
[02:39:52] 2.2 to kick things off let me
[02:39:56] introduce dream J Memoir please be good
[02:39:59] please be good as you may remember in
[02:40:01] the 2.1 story line the screen at clock
[02:40:03] Studios game Park was split in two I
[02:40:06] remember that to restore the park to its
[02:40:08] former glory Trailblazers must take on
[02:40:10] the crucial task of repairing the screen
[02:40:12] cool it wasn't the Trailblazers who
[02:40:15] broke the screen and if I'm not mistaken
[02:40:18] the screen was wasn't the intended
[02:40:20] target was it Mr
[02:40:24] aventurine anyway the nameless should be
[02:40:26] congratulated on their admirable screen
[02:40:29] fixing spirit in the Clocky dream dry
[02:40:32] memo event TR bases are task with dir I
[02:40:35] hate that clock films that do well in
[02:40:37] test screenings will increase the part
[02:40:40] revenue and attract investment this
[02:40:42] money will go towards fixing the screen
[02:40:45] that was damaged beep beep filming the
[02:40:47] whole thing in a single shot miss Robin
[02:40:51] I'm afraid not every actor has cut off
[02:40:53] for that approach as a professional
[02:40:55] interational peace media host I'm of the
[02:40:57] opinion that skillful editing can
[02:40:59] enhance a film's pace and emotional
[02:41:01] impact true in this artistic undertaking
[02:41:05] the key to the clock I it's too like
[02:41:07] unsettling it's like Mickey Mouse time
[02:41:10] dice to different scenes it will about
[02:41:12] changes in the audience's emotional
[02:41:13] responses thrilling comedic or dramatic
[02:41:18] each film must achieve certain key
[02:41:20] objectives to pass the internal
[02:41:22] screening a as they gain more
[02:41:25] recognition Trailblazers will also have
[02:41:27] the opportunity to create
[02:41:29] commercials plus they'll have the chance
[02:41:31] to explore the spin-off stories of
[02:41:33] supporting characters
[02:41:35] exactly successfully editing a classic
[02:41:38] ending grants you side character
[02:41:40] spin-off reels thereby revealing their
[02:41:42] coresponding extra story oh it's the the
[02:41:46] whatever his name is the guy like
[02:41:49] again unlocked new skills in pentacon
[02:41:52] but isn't this more like editing than
[02:41:55] directing hu that's his name well I
[02:41:57] wouldn't put it that way during the
[02:41:59] editing process Trailblazers have the
[02:42:01] chance to experiment with different plot
[02:42:03] directions and might end up with an
[02:42:05] ending that's completely different from
[02:42:07] the original storyline okay great
[02:42:10] stories often originate from notable
[02:42:13] historic events I'm just about the can
[02:42:16] you show us what it do type of visual
[02:42:18] memory weaving together threads of
[02:42:21] memories to create one Complete Tale
[02:42:25] it's quite impressive agreed and after
[02:42:29] finishing the specified missions tro
[02:42:31] blades will be rewarded with the event
[02:42:33] light G tomorrow's Journey ah it looks
[02:42:38] like a story that took place at some
[02:42:40] point on the express bro this looks like
[02:42:42] if I say who this looks like I'm going
[02:42:43] to get laugh atting and celebrating with
[02:42:45] nameless of the past yesterday's
[02:42:47] memories this looks like adult
[02:42:50] and while the conductor's companion but
[02:42:51] I don't know if I didn't I don't know if
[02:42:54] we know who this never ceases moving
[02:42:59] on Galactic
[02:43:01] baseer I mean the gaser is set to
[02:43:05] undergo an exciting round of testing in
[02:43:08] version 2.2 huh the same Giovani from
[02:43:11] ethereum mors that's right after the
[02:43:15] success of ethereum Wars Giovani has
[02:43:17] decided to sponsor a brand new new game
[02:43:19] project and penac it it is said that
[02:43:23] deep within the vast Cosmos the
[02:43:25] strongest baseball bat lies hidden to
[02:43:28] find this bat the galactic baseballer
[02:43:31] decides to leave home embarking on an
[02:43:34] extensive search to locate the treasure
[02:43:37] there are many factions interested in
[02:43:39] this bat and the galactic baseballer
[02:43:42] must endure many challenges and defeat
[02:43:45] many foes in order to progress onward it
[02:43:49] seems that in every battle wave the
[02:43:52] trail the galactic
[02:43:55] baseballer needs to defeat as many
[02:43:57] enemies as possible gain experience what
[02:44:00] do this team come Black Swan Ron May
[02:44:02] precisely after the team levels up they
[02:44:05] can choose one of three random weapons
[02:44:08] or accessories the weapons help our
[02:44:10] baseballer defeat enemies while the
[02:44:12] accessories Grant weapons they have like
[02:44:15] a meta team and I've seen the previews
[02:44:18] run like
[02:44:19] my advice is to focus on leveling up
[02:44:22] weapons first after achieving max level
[02:44:24] with the weapon and if in possession of
[02:44:26] its resident accessory the weapon can be
[02:44:28] leveled up to a legendary weapon which
[02:44:31] greatly increases the galactic
[02:44:32] baseballers fighting capability sure
[02:44:35] complete each challenges earn raccoon
[02:44:38] tokens to enhance your fighting skills
[02:44:40] and accumulate Cosmic reputation which
[02:44:42] can be exchange for
[02:44:45] rewards the little raccoons in this
[02:44:47] event are so cute
[02:44:50] cute unque charm just looking at them
[02:44:53] makes me want to join in the fun how
[02:44:55] about our three guests make a prediction
[02:44:59] will the galactic baseballer get their
[02:45:02] hands on the ultimate baseball bat I
[02:45:05] think the name Galactic baseballer might
[02:45:08] be a giveaway
[02:45:11] true moving on our next event is called
[02:45:15] all about booill oh okay I'm down and
[02:45:19] how exactly will everything be showcased
[02:45:23] in this segment we've adopted a
[02:45:25] character profile approach you won't see
[02:45:28] Boot Hill but about his legendary
[02:45:31] exploits rumor has it that booill has
[02:45:34] recently been involved in some major
[02:45:36] heists with many entities including the
[02:45:39] space station suffering losses I hear
[02:45:43] the IPC and others are planning to put a
[02:45:46] bounty on his head with so assignments
[02:45:49] available I'd say it's a great chance to
[02:45:51] make a profit whenc Chief from the space
[02:45:54] station thinks the Trailblazers are well
[02:45:56] suited to the job recommend them to the
[02:45:59] IPC the Trailblazers are Jo ass with
[02:46:03] J not exactly more like a get-rich quick
[02:46:06] scheme with friends during the event the
[02:46:09] Trailblazers will have to you guys are
[02:46:10] typing B but just free resources for
[02:46:13] no in exchange for assignment rewards
[02:46:17] all I have to say is thank you you Mr W
[02:46:20] profiting from assignments is one thing
[02:46:22] but no underhanded
[02:46:24] tactics
[02:46:26] understood which is boring yeah but free
[02:46:28] is free like some fun fun EVS are cool

[02:53:58] done before the version's out anyways it
[02:53:59] was cool live
[02:54:02] stream in my defense though I didn't
[02:54:04] even do the genin quest so it's not like
[02:54:05] favoritism okay I'm just I'm just I
[02:54:07] questing is
[02:54:10] hard why do you have two genjin programs
[02:54:13] on your taskbar
[02:54:14] sskk do you want to see do you want to
[02:54:16] see why I'll open them both this one
[02:54:18] open the
[02:54:19] launcher oh I just black screened oops
[02:54:21] this one opens the launcher and the
[02:54:23] other one opens the game directly it's
[02:54:24] not sucks you can do that too if you
[02:54:26] want I the only reason I have the
[02:54:27] launcher here is to patch
[02:54:28] it this other one's the
[02:54:36] game how I just right clicked pin to
[02:54:38] taskar look if I open this right
[02:54:41] now sorry it's I don't know why black
[02:54:44] screens if I open this right now it'll
[02:54:45] open the game directly
[02:54:48] boom see yeah I don't have I so
[02:54:50] sometimes I forget to patch the the
[02:54:51] launcher cuz I just open the game
[02:54:53] directly why would you do that cuz I
[02:54:54] don't feel like opening the
[02:54:56] launcher I don't know I do that I did
[02:54:59] that with star rail too but for some
[02:55:00] reason the star one unpinned I used to

[03:03:07] that why is Bo Hill a harder version
[03:03:09] than blade please do not compare two
[03:03:12] kings needlessly I like blade better but
[03:03:14] I think buha looks cool I think buha
[03:03:15] looks cool like I'm hyped for him but I
[03:03:17] I I Blade's my favorite still sorry
[03:03:22] sorry but like no one else likes blade
[03:03:24] like okay I feel like I'm the only blade
[03:03:26] main remaining like two people play
[03:03:29] blade honestly in the last memory of
[03:03:32] chaos I didn't even play him caught well
[03:03:34] I did but it was like a it was
[03:03:37] rough me I
[03:03:40] do I saw like usage rates or like
[03:03:42] character H like having rates whatever
[03:03:44] that word is like ownership rates HSR
[03:03:48] character um rate I don't know what the
[03:03:52] [ __ ] it's called like I don't know what
[03:03:52] to Google but I I saw
[03:03:55] it ownership is that the
[03:03:58] [Music]
[03:04:01] word I don't know how credible this is
[03:04:04] but uh dude look at how far down blade
[03:04:07] is honestly like 34 is not bad
[03:04:12] [Music]
[03:04:18] topaz being that low is kind of crazy
[03:04:20] but I guess she's getting a rerun like
[03:04:21] it's been a while and now like people
[03:04:23] have like the thing is with topaz too
[03:04:25] she synergize well with the ratio who
[03:04:26] everyone has but like I'm pretty sure
[03:04:28] her last matter was before ratio
[03:04:32] so it's not accurate yeah like I don't
[03:04:34] I'm not trusting a random [ __ ] Reddit
[03:04:36] post but still
[03:04:51] [Music]
[03:04:55] yeah how do 72.5% of people have [ __ ]

[03:05:13] I also didn't have jart now I do but it
[03:05:15] was to [ __ ] adventurine which L
[03:05:18] invalidates it but it's
[03:05:23] fine wo is lower than I expected but I
[03:05:26] guess there's a lot of healers I guess
[03:05:28] it just depends since when the last
[03:05:30] Banner
[03:05:34] was it's done through survey
[03:05:36] [Music]
[03:05:43] sampling do you think there's a certain
[03:05:46] type of bias when it comes to like what
[03:05:48] character Mains are more likely to fill
[03:05:50] out a survey like I feel like if you're
[03:05:52] a blade M like you're not [ __ ]
