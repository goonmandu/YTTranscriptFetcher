[00:21:27] plan so Ito he doesn't have a [ __ ]
[00:21:28] backup plan his backup plan is [ __ ]
[00:21:30] ushi Goro Maybe
[00:21:32] but I think his passes are like more
[00:21:34] furry than that so we're gonna rule out
[00:21:36] Goro uh who else is Joe there's ning
[00:21:38] Wong
[00:21:39] uh and there's Noelle Noelle could have
[00:21:42] a backup plan ning Wong I feel like her
[00:21:44] ability doesn't look like that but I
[00:21:45] could be wrong
[00:21:46] it could be Noel
[00:21:49] it's not Zhang Lee
[00:21:54] okay if I miss yunjin again I'm gonna
[00:21:57] get like killed
[00:21:59] I actually don't know this is just a
[00:22:01] guess I dude what the [ __ ] is this bro
[00:22:05] I feel like out of all the jail
[00:22:06] characters the most likely to have a
[00:22:08] backup plan
[00:22:09] surely it's Noel she's like a she's like
[00:22:12] you're back
[00:22:18] but I could see this being yunjin and I
[00:22:20] could see this being
[00:22:21] I don't think this icon I've seen on
[00:22:23] drawing this kid I'm pretty sure
[00:22:29] and I don't it could be ning long but
[00:22:32] has like the what kind of sick twisted
[00:22:35] dream am I waking up to the thing with
[00:22:38] my okay the thing with my ning Wong
[00:22:40] knowledge is I kind of forget which of
[00:22:41] her passives are actually constellations
[00:22:43] like the like mirror breaking and giving
[00:22:45] you like when you walk through it gives
[00:22:46] you Geo damage wait I feel like this
[00:22:48] might be that
[00:22:51] [ __ ] it oh my I am so smart oh my God
[00:22:55] wait a pure stroke of Genius is it
[00:23:00] oh my oh well it's a different one but
[00:23:02] still still hey hey hey cause okay well
[00:23:06] whatever I mean I mean I was thinking
[00:23:09] like it could be a backup plan I think
[00:23:12] it could be a backup plan
[00:23:15] also I felt like I saw this icon before
[00:23:17] unfortunately I didn't get the yeah it
[00:23:20] was this one
[00:23:22] I feel like in my mind ning long has so
[00:23:24] many passives because a lot of them like
[00:23:26] are from constellations like this one
[00:23:27] you get another [ __ ] mirror when it's
[00:23:28] chattered you [ __ ] like oh that's
[00:23:30] useless but yeah like this [ __ ] you get

[00:28:32] 400 resin okay listen
[00:28:44] I don't want to explain why I have that
[00:28:46] because Heroes don't do heroic Acts
[00:28:51] for publicity no one's like I'm not like
[00:28:53] oh look at me feeding this person that
[00:28:55] needs food that's weird okay like if you
[00:28:57] do it that's great but if you're
[00:28:59] advertising it it's like you're doing it
[00:29:01] for like clout like what are you doing
[00:29:02] but okay uh but okay fitting because
[00:29:06] we're playing shot so I was going to
[00:29:09] start stream last night I had my resin
[00:29:11] at 120 out of 160 I was chilling I
[00:29:14] noticed my resin is capping and I
[00:29:16] noticed the day's about to reset what do
[00:29:17] I do do I act selfishly spend my resin
[00:29:22] and then go to bed and that's it no
[00:29:24] instead I act selfish selflessly for you
[00:29:28] guys
[00:29:29] and be right before the day resets 4 59
[00:29:33] a.m I refresh a little bit of resin with
[00:29:37] the money that my good friend Aubry
[00:29:39] Graham also known as Drake gave me so
[00:29:41] that I could give you guys content at my
[00:29:44] own expense I am hurting my own resin
[00:29:47] for your own entertainment so you don't
[00:29:50] have to thank me just know that
[00:29:54] Heroes do exist that's all I'm gonna say
[00:29:56] Heroes do exist that's a good quote
[00:29:58] Heroes to exist
[00:30:00] anyways
[00:30:02] um we're gonna play against your back uh

[00:30:10] appreciate it
[00:30:12] excellent Name
[00:30:14] excellent Name
[00:30:16] um here's what we're gonna do here's my
[00:30:17] plan for the stream right okay while I
[00:30:19] do this challenge while talking to you
[00:30:20] guys okay so we're gonna start I've
[00:30:23] noticed that my Fontan exploration
[00:30:24] percentage
[00:30:27] low okay I
[00:30:30] some people I just means the draft be
[00:30:31] like cat W does he even play the game
[00:30:33] okay
[00:30:34] I've been waiting to stream that's why
[00:30:37] so we're gonna do like a little bit like
[00:30:38] 20 minutes 30 minutes of a quick
[00:30:40] exploring then artifact farming then
[00:30:43] I've saved a bunch of artifacts with a
[00:30:45] strong box we're gonna do that and then
[00:30:46] we'll do some abyss and then that should
[00:30:48] be an offer today and then I can't
[00:30:49] review this next stream probably maybe
[00:30:50] who knows
[00:30:51] getting here oh by the way to the new
[00:30:54] people that just joined if you want to
[00:30:56] do that I kind of do things the forum
[00:30:58] for cursed accounts will be posted in
[00:30:59] the the Discord smash Mark Discord today
[00:31:02] probably and then the whale account
[00:31:05] reviews will be later so yes wow I love
[00:31:08] for a minute wait am I doing a quest
[00:31:10] what the f I was crossing off stream I
[00:31:13] was crossing off stream I was crossing
[00:31:14] off Stream True all we have to do the
[00:31:16] event I forgot I forgot after the event
[00:31:21] I forgot we're gonna do the event today
[00:31:22] we're gonna let me write that on my
[00:31:23] notepad of things to do events
[00:31:26] okay
[00:31:31] this is a really good Quest I'm never uh
[00:31:34] finishing it by the way
[00:31:36] because I'm pretty sure this is the
[00:31:37] event where there's a rune grader that
[00:31:39] people sits that has unlimited HP so I'm
[00:31:41] never gonna finish it
[00:31:46] no way isn't this the one wait let me
[00:31:49] look it up is it Jeff 77 ruin
[00:31:51] this corner you're here for the event
[00:31:53] you don't need it for the crown I'll
[00:31:54] just cut the crown and who guys
[00:31:56] upload but I cannot forgive you for an
[00:31:59] EU friendly stream
[00:32:02] look your world just too fast in the
[00:32:06] aqueous wait is this the quest I don't
[00:32:08] know what quest I'm [ __ ] doing bro
[00:32:10] no this is not the quest
[00:32:13] well whatever
[00:32:15] oh it is okay maybe it's a different
[00:32:16] step whatever it's a different steps
[00:32:18] you'll be up against this enemy and the
[00:32:21] thing about this enemy is that when you
[00:32:23] kill it it doesn't actually die and it
[00:32:26] will keep doing this over and over until
[00:32:28] you break this wall which means he's
[00:32:31] actually a perfect test dummy if you
[00:32:32] want to practice a new team that you're
[00:32:34] not really familiar with however if you
[00:32:36] want to keep him alive hey you won't be
[00:32:38] able to finish the quest to which you do
[00:32:40] need to finish in order to do the mega
[00:32:42] mega melee event and B it's a bit
[00:32:45] complicated to be able to teleport out
[00:32:47] of here because it tells you to finish
[00:32:49] the fight so the point if it's going
[00:32:50] away it's A world quest not an event so
[00:32:52] it should be here forever the way to
[00:32:53] glitch yourself out of here
[00:32:55] we already have the samurai Inazuma dude
[00:32:57] you guys don't understand the F Well
[00:33:00] maybe you do but most people don't
[00:33:02] understand the [ __ ] tragedy of having
[00:33:04] to test or showcase a team when you have
[00:33:06] good dude anything dies before I can
[00:33:09] finish a rotation I have to use the
[00:33:12] massanori or a rune guard or [ __ ] a
[00:33:14] cryo plant with literally like level one
[00:33:17] weapons like I have to remove all of my
[00:33:20] weapons and my feather and my snap like
[00:33:23] everything or they die and they still
[00:33:25] die they [ __ ] still dies
[00:33:28] and then the Geo the Primo Geo Bishop is
[00:33:31] like technically the best but he still
[00:33:33] [ __ ] with you and he's still like
[00:33:34] immune at the start and then he like
[00:33:36] explodes and you have to put a portable
[00:33:37] Waypoint and this dude is so fun and
[00:33:39] then vvn is cool but she's [ __ ] Hydro
[00:33:42] all the time so you're just High drawing
[00:33:44] or vaporizing or
[00:33:47] you want to be able to do the event yeah
[00:33:48] but this is permanent and the event is
[00:33:49] temporary and apparently I checked you
[00:33:53] can still get the crown the only thing
[00:33:54] you can't get is Bennett so for most
[00:33:56] people just get the [ __ ] Bennett but
[00:33:58] for me I already have six minutes I
[00:34:00] might as well just not get the Bennett
[00:34:01] and then just get like crown and Primo
[00:34:03] gems and [ __ ] it's probably worth it for
[00:34:05] me like it's not worth it for most
[00:34:06] people but for me like it it's probably
[00:34:10] worth so yeah
[00:34:21] okay
[00:34:22] you can get everything including Bennett
[00:34:24] oh really oh
[00:34:27] well there you go but yeah like my bed
[00:34:28] it's already like
[00:34:30] I have the sixth one
[00:34:34] and then it's already broken the bokin
[00:34:37] was Ben in my first Crown who the [ __ ]
[00:34:38] was my first crown
[00:34:40] did crowds come out before shower after
[00:34:45] when did the first Crown come out
[00:34:50] before long before okay then yeah was
[00:34:52] Bennett
[00:34:53] because I'm pretty sure yeah okay 1.1
[00:34:56] because I'm pretty sure I crowned
[00:34:57] Bennett first but in my mind I'm like if
[00:34:58] shot was out I would have crown child
[00:34:59] but yeah yeah okay it was definitely bad
[00:35:01] then
[00:35:02] all right cool uh [ __ ] this Quest let's
[00:35:04] do a bit of the event actually that
[00:35:06] counts as a exploration also let me show
[00:35:08] you guys what I did off stream let me
[00:35:09] show you guys what I did where's the
[00:35:11] reputation
[00:35:12] socks do you think there will be another
[00:35:15] idea
[00:35:18] second year there wasn't first year
[00:35:20] there was second year there was a third
[00:35:22] year dude dude why would there be drama
[00:35:25] for the anniversary rewards when we're
[00:35:27] gonna get okay no leaks but I'm just
[00:35:30] saying why would there be drama when
[00:35:31] we're gonna get the five star standard
[00:35:34] character of our choice 10 of Queen
[00:35:36] Fates 10 intertwined Fates uh uh the the
[00:35:39] crystal shop refresh as always obviously
[00:35:41] a free battle pass weapon even to free
[00:35:44] to play players also also also a Sumer
[00:35:48] ruian four-star of our choice
[00:35:51] and an untradable weapon oh sorry sorry
[00:35:54] uh unpurchasable skin for any uh a
[00:35:57] glider and an event weapon anniversary
[00:36:00] weapon and a pet and you will get the
[00:36:03] seals in our teapot and we can pet them
[00:36:05] whoa do a backflip
[00:36:12] no we'll probably get like five wishes
[00:36:13] uh but I feel like people are used to it
[00:36:15] now dude I did I did a certain assorted
[00:36:19] notice a certain triple and a certain
[00:36:21] shrimp all of them officer dude this if

[00:46:49] he's a little 80 I don't think I need 90
[00:46:50] we're chilling oh I need to level this

[00:46:56] yeah we're chilling I think
[00:46:59] oh dude my nilu okay okay
[00:47:02] so
[00:47:04] I was in my mind I was like okay my name
[00:47:07] is gonna be on dull blade until Fontan
[00:47:08] comes out and then in Fontan they're
[00:47:10] gonna release a blacksmith HP sword and
[00:47:12] then I'll put the HP sword on her
[00:47:13] because like what is all the other
[00:47:15] swords [ __ ] who cares
[00:47:17] the blocks of the weapon unfortunately
[00:47:18] does not give HP so
[00:47:20] I I at some point you know surely
[00:47:27] surely
[00:47:30] um
[00:47:32] yeah I do need to level I was looking at
[00:47:35] what weapons I might want to level
[00:47:36] before it's like like now that I have
[00:47:38] like resin to spend thinking prototype
[00:47:40] Amber it's not like I don't need to
[00:47:42] level it but my by juice HP is kind of
[00:47:43] cope without it
[00:47:45] um and I was also thinking of leveling
[00:47:47] just in case you get cool Claymore
[00:47:49] characters which I don't think we will
[00:47:50] but just in case we do ignore this
[00:47:52] weapon on ayato by the way I'm thinking
[00:47:54] of leveling in akumaru because I don't
[00:47:56] have that many claimers levels I have
[00:47:58] one two three four and then two support
[00:47:59] ones
[00:48:00] so I'm at level nakumaru
[00:48:03] um
[00:48:05] foreign
[00:48:09] because my like if I use a lot of book
[00:48:11] characters and right now my child is on
[00:48:13] a level one harp uh so I might level
[00:48:16] another bow as well but I don't know
[00:48:17] which one I don't like leveling to the
[00:48:19] same bows I like using like different
[00:48:20] weapons but I could level another heart
[00:48:22] if I want
[00:48:25] why did Philip
[00:48:28] what is your name
[00:48:30] Philip poop
[00:48:36] okay Mario is pretty it's cool it's also
[00:48:37] good
[00:48:39] and I have it refined
[00:48:44] all right let's uh finish what we're
[00:48:46] doing and then we'll go do the art resin
[00:48:50] okay wait wait we have okay I gotta calm
[00:48:53] down we're gonna unlock a few things
[00:48:54] then we'll do the event then we'll spend
[00:48:56] our resin then we'll do strawbox and do
[00:48:58] Abyss okay cool
[00:48:59] let me go unlock this I need to unlock
[00:49:00] some things because I haven't unlocked
[00:49:02] like anything
[00:49:03] also this team is [ __ ] garbage
[00:49:05] restoration let me uh change teams
[00:49:12] okay cool
[00:49:18] let's make a good uh we could make a
[00:49:20] good from an A Team
[00:49:22] we'll do this double Hydro actually we
[00:49:24] don't need double Hydra we'll do uh yeah
[00:49:25] there you go good from an A Team she'll
[00:49:27] be dispersed
[00:49:29] and then we'll put fars on here
[00:49:35] actually I want Scara for exploring okay
[00:49:37] we're not gonna We're Not Gonna mean
[00:49:38] that hard on scarf exploring and I want

[00:50:11] spent it
[00:50:13] fake chow mein I mean I like Xiao the
[00:50:15] most but for exploring I think scarves
[00:50:17] convenient because Xiao hurts himself
[00:50:19] every time he alts so I wouldn't want
[00:50:21] him to hurt himself just to kill like a
[00:50:23] hilly drill it's like I love Chow so
[00:50:25] much I don't want him to have to lament
[00:50:27] when he doesn't need to also what the

[00:51:01] too slow
[00:51:05] like chalice in English yes but
[00:51:09] yeah
[00:51:11] Quebec lore is like a wild ride
[00:51:16] The Wind Rises
[00:51:20] there's no way he doesn't have a script
[00:51:22] behind this monitor
[00:51:24] did I wish man I wish I was normal

[00:52:32] gonna leak it anyways I have things like
[00:52:35] do the golden set I can't review forms
[00:52:37] and then it's like everything I need to

[00:56:28] is normal like okay I'm not even coping
[00:56:32] or joking right now I
[00:56:35] me as a person I'm either very energetic
[00:56:37] or extremely dead and when I stream and

[00:56:48] and then when I stream it I'm like hype

[00:56:50] clips and then it makes me to a point
[00:56:52] where like
[00:56:53] I want to be hyped but sometimes I'm
[00:56:55] like dead and then I look at myself and
[00:56:57] I'll see like I kill myself and I'll be
[00:56:58] like how am I this person and then
[00:57:00] sometimes I am that I actually don't
[00:57:02] know what's wrong with me

[00:58:23] okay we just need all we need is 20
[00:58:25] exploration and then we're done like I
[00:58:27] just need to unlock the weeklies
[00:58:33] the Toronto video you're still calling
[00:58:35] it scary I mean
[00:58:36] okay I'm also a lot calmer around other
[00:58:38] people like in person people have told
[00:58:40] me I'm a lot more calm because like I
[00:58:42] don't know how to say this but like
[00:58:44] I don't want to be the one dumbass
[00:58:47] screaming and making everything awkward
[00:58:49] to everyone so I'm like pretty like I'm
[00:58:51] not reserved I'm still outgoing but like
[00:58:53] like I'm not a feminine but I'm not like
[00:58:56] just like lamenting
[00:58:59] like dude I don't want to just like I
[00:59:01] don't know I don't know
[00:59:04] no you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:59:16] definitely introverted I think I'm
[00:59:18] ambidextrous ambivert little uzivert
[00:59:21] like okay
[00:59:23] like okay listen
[00:59:25] I kind of so I think I was introverted
[00:59:27] but I kind of forced myself to just be
[00:59:29] like
[00:59:30] I kind of over are you [ __ ] me with a
[00:59:33] javelin
[00:59:34] okay okay yo if it's a Jeff reacts to
[00:59:37] this and calls me bad I'm I'm done I'm
[00:59:39] actually done reset okay I I kind of
[00:59:41] forced myself to be like I I
[00:59:43] rationalized it where I was like dude if
[00:59:45] someone comes up and talks to me and
[00:59:46] says hi like I feel like it's like a
[00:59:48] positive action right where it's like oh
[00:59:50] like this person seems nice whatever
[00:59:52] unless it's like weird or people are
[00:59:53] like whatever like weird creepy but like
[00:59:55] in general so I was like
[00:59:57] what is the downside of me just saying
[00:59:59] hi to people or like classmates or like
[01:00:01] just being like you know going out
[01:00:02] through them saying hi like if I want
[01:00:03] you so like I kind of brainwashed myself
[01:00:06] into doing that and then I kind of
[01:00:08] became extroverted because I just got a
[01:00:09] lot of friends or not like God a lot of
[01:00:11] friends but like talk to a lot of people
[01:00:14] wait why can't I access this it's red
[01:00:17] streamer you have the Numa usia okay
[01:00:25] do you even know what ambidextrous is
[01:00:26] it's being able to write or like do
[01:00:28] multiple things with both hands right
[01:00:30] I'm right-handed but I played hockey
[01:00:32] with my left hand so technically I don't

[01:00:59] break and I was like racing and I was
[01:01:02] winning and then there's like the the
[01:01:04] ring right like the border and then I

[01:05:24] character
[01:05:26] less than a thousand defense this
[01:05:28] already has to be good
[01:05:29] staff of Homer
[01:05:31] 4 Vermillion aware
[01:05:34] C1 triple crowned we like to see that

[01:05:42] yeah okay because uh child okay
[01:05:44] Vermillion let's look at that goblet
[01:05:45] first
[01:05:49] it's your birthday I'm gonna pretend I
[01:05:51] didn't see this okay we'll start with
[01:05:52] reset reset
[01:05:54] okay Xiao let's look at the uh oh
[01:05:56] Vermillion okay let's look at the flower
[01:05:57] first
[01:05:58] okay that's not even okay it's not even
[01:06:01] bad yo that's I'm sorry I'm sorry that's
[01:06:04] not even bad but it's like the one of
[01:06:06] the worst outcomes uh better than ER
[01:06:08] it's better than ER I'm sorry that
[01:06:10] happened to you attack's still good
[01:06:12] attack's still good
[01:06:16] it would be good on shanha too true
[01:06:20] okay feather
[01:06:22] that's not that's actually pretty good
[01:06:23] it's actually pretty good it's actually
[01:06:24] pretty good
[01:06:27] 26 for damage that's decent
[01:06:31] uh I mean lucky number seven
[01:06:34] uh this is okay listen it's actually a
[01:06:36] fine child it's actually fine whoa never
[01:06:39] mind okay never mind never mind yo
[01:06:42] Xiao has crit rate Ascension
[01:06:45] how do you have okay he literally gets
[01:06:48] free crit rate just go
[01:06:50] also okay okay listen if your circle is
[01:06:52] like amazing and you only have like a
[01:06:54] really good credit one then it's okay to
[01:06:56] use a credential it and then like maybe
[01:06:57] go like oh you can do like death match
[01:06:59] or like Jade spear or whatever but your
[01:07:01] crit circuit is not even really good so
[01:07:02] you might as well just go crazy one and
[01:07:04] then you'll be fine
[01:07:05] like oh criterate circle with no sub
[01:07:07] stats is still better than this
[01:07:10] better
[01:07:12] okay I'm already skeptical but two piece
[01:07:14] two piece is fine The Echoes offset is
[01:07:17] concerning
[01:07:18] okay if your child doesn't have dude
[01:07:27] you're creating once per patch your last
[01:07:29] crit was in [ __ ] you know Zumo
[01:07:32] this is really good this piece is really
[01:07:34] good this is also okay how do you have
[01:07:36] two God pieces but you have no crude
[01:07:38] rate
[01:07:41] okay that's also really good all right
[01:07:43] that's explaining it and now for some
[01:07:45] reason you have a crit damage circuit
[01:07:46] okay
[01:07:48] dude just go crit rate Circle it and
[01:07:50] you're goaded or a crit weapon if you
[01:07:53] have like a Polar Star [ __ ] another
[01:07:55] crew weapon that could work
[01:07:57] or just go crazy also keep in mind for
[01:08:00] child tartaglia Ajax heart of depth is
[01:08:02] like you don't need harder depth and
[01:08:04] sometimes it's not even the best like
[01:08:05] you can go two piece two piece of like
[01:08:07] any there's I could literally name like
[01:08:09] 15 right now and like if you're high
[01:08:10] invested you can do no blast and then
[01:08:11] like a big ass burst
[01:08:13] um like two piece there's a lot you can
[01:08:15] do so you don't actually even Echoes
[01:08:16] like you already have an offset Echoes
[01:08:18] like you don't actually need like let's
[01:08:19] say you you're like dude I've been
[01:08:21] farming hard depth for six years since
[01:08:23] my child was born now my child's an
[01:08:25] adult and I still don't have a Critic
[01:08:26] circuit that's fine you can just do an
[01:08:28] offset greater good and then boom
[01:08:33] yeah there's also Nim stream but you
[01:08:35] most normal people haven't farmed
[01:08:37] nymstream yet uh or ever will
[01:08:41] um yeah
[01:08:42] I wish I made another child guide I want
[01:08:44] to but I was too busy this match

[01:17:24] custom glider and like a weapon that you
[01:17:26] can only get from that or just like
[01:17:28] skins because then it's like it doesn't
[01:17:29] matter if like you can't do it but then
[01:17:31] if you can it's like you look [ __ ]
[01:17:33] like a Chad boom
[01:17:34] a name card Oh Glory a [ __ ] RGB
[01:17:37] [Music]
[01:17:39] name card
[01:17:40] that's like animated
[01:17:47] you unlock French voice acting
[01:17:51] foreign
[01:18:02] can't and won't at least for like a
[01:18:06] years no maybe not years but like for a
[01:18:08] while
[01:18:09] they don't want to give us actual end
[01:18:12] game like hard content because
[01:18:15] they want the people that want that
[01:18:16] stuff to go to their other games that is
[01:18:18] my theory but that's just a theory a
[01:18:22] game
[01:18:22] [Music]
[01:18:23] I could be wrong though hopefully I'm
[01:18:25] wrong I mean I hope I'm wrong
[01:18:28] but they're like oh you want a game go
[01:18:30] play [ __ ] stereo go play honkai Third
[01:18:32] go play [ __ ] this other game done
[01:18:34] this whatever but maybe but like I feel
[01:18:36] like because it's not like it's hard to
[01:18:38] do
[01:18:40] come on this game is so good smooge yeah
[01:18:44] the combat system in this game is like
[01:18:46] low-key too good for the game like look
[01:18:49] listen I like gentian as like a story
[01:18:51] game I like the quests like it's all
[01:18:53] cool that's all great but it's like at
[01:18:55] the same time it's like the combat
[01:18:57] system is so sick that it's like I wish
[01:18:58] I could go further with it
[01:19:01] that's kind of why it's like it yeah I
[01:19:04] don't know
[01:19:05] minus one sponsor dude I love kitchen
[01:19:07] and I love story and I love presently
[01:19:09] like I like all of them I'm just saying
[01:19:11] it's like I wish I could have everything
[01:19:13] in each game
[01:19:19] I'm gonna laugh
[01:19:23] so I might see it's not hard soccer and
[01:19:25] meta progression no see that's the thing
[01:19:27] the more you play the more you get
[01:19:28] alongside make it easier but there's
[01:19:30] like a easy baby mode which is like the
[01:19:32] Swarm [ __ ] mode and you could do that
[01:19:34] but then each other path has like fun
[01:19:36] things you could do you could do like
[01:19:37] the Hillary clearing it you could do
[01:19:38] remembrance freezing or like to cheese
[01:19:39] it you do a normal destruction or
[01:19:41] hunting if you're a Chad you could do
[01:19:42] like each thing is cool and then it's
[01:19:45] like each time a player can do it a
[01:19:46] specific way where it's like actually
[01:19:47] balanced and for people that are just
[01:19:49] bad or like don't want to learn it then
[01:19:51] you can get to the baby mode and then
[01:19:53] you're chilling and then for the people
[01:19:54] that are like oh this is too hard then
[01:19:55] you just do the [ __ ] cheese ways to
[01:19:57] do it even as like a free to play and
[01:19:58] whatever and then you're fine and you
[01:20:00] get the rewards and you dip and then for
[01:20:01] the people that actually like it and
[01:20:02] want the challenge then you can grind
[01:20:03] the hard stuff
[01:20:04] true
[01:20:07] like stuff where it feels like you don't
[01:20:10] just need good artifacts and need like
[01:20:12] every whale character in the world
[01:20:14] to clear is like usually good
[01:20:26] okay I got them all by the way chat if
[01:20:28] you don't know this place you get six
[01:20:29] Crystal flies and ores so yeah do it
[01:20:32] also did anyone figure out where the
[01:20:34] [ __ ] Berry puff went so we we visited
[01:20:36] very puff every day at their home and we
[01:20:39] fed Berry puff fish then Berry puff went
[01:20:41] to play with a friend
[01:20:43] and we went and we played with Daddy
[01:20:45] pops and then Berry puff disappeared
[01:20:46] where the [ __ ] is very pop now it's been
[01:20:49] like two weeks 60 months I'll hide
[01:20:53] them's breast milk
[01:21:01] surely he's somewhere right
[01:21:05] go north from where you fed him yeah but
[01:21:07] okay
[01:21:09] that's where he went to the first time
[01:21:10] but the SEC like we saw him there he did
[01:21:13] a backflip for us and then the next day
[01:21:15] he wasn't there anymore TTS was so low
[01:21:17] oh I couldn't make it louder
[01:21:19] I don't know why my teachers though
[01:21:25] like I don't think he's here anymore
[01:21:27] [Music]
[01:21:31] this child drawing the Bennett Tomah
[01:21:33] good
[01:21:34] um
[01:21:36] um
[01:21:39] um
[01:21:40] I mean visually yes
[01:21:45] but if Tomah is changed with Shang Ling
[01:21:48] hey
[01:21:54] yeah it used to be here
[01:21:58] why do you hate male wife Toma I don't
[01:22:00] hate Toma it's just you're not gonna
[01:22:01] you're gonna Vape with Tomah You're
[01:22:03] Gonna Play Vape Toma that's what you're
[01:22:05] gonna do I mean sure I mean technically
[01:22:07] you could do like a [ __ ] like a
[01:22:09] intergrational and then like I mean you
[01:22:12] wouldn't really want to use Tomah there
[01:22:14] but like you can
[01:22:16] I guess
[01:22:17] you could do like some virgin stuff
[01:22:21] your hydro character then your Toma than
[01:22:23] a dendro character and then whatever you
[01:22:24] want
[01:22:25] there you go
[01:22:30] yeah I don't know where he is
[01:22:33] Mel Toma is actually good okay uh
[01:22:42] I mean
[01:22:46] when I was ar-40 I mained overload the
[01:22:50] Luke I played I played the Luke Fishel
[01:22:53] uh I played Kaya in the team because I
[01:22:55] thought Kyle was cool and I had an
[01:22:56] Aquila favonia and then my last thought
[01:22:58] was a Healer who started with Barbara uh
[01:23:01] and then on my second half of the Abyss
[01:23:03] I would no on the on the second
[01:23:04] obviously this I would put Barbara
[01:23:05] because she was the good healer and then
[01:23:06] the and then the only other healer had
[01:23:08] was Noel so I put Noel in the first team
[01:23:10] and hoped that I never had to swap into
[01:23:12] her uh and then eventually I got Chichi
[01:23:14] who I was like oh she's amazing and then
[01:23:16] so I put her on that team and then
[01:23:18] eventually uh I had bet it and we
[01:23:20] realized in about October 2020 how
[01:23:22] broken bet it was so then I started
[01:23:23] using Bandit
[01:23:26] dude I saw wait let me pull this up ziox
[01:23:29] old clips I was looking through this
[01:23:31] dude
[01:23:32] look at this
[01:23:34] I saw where is this
[01:23:37] I saw what my characters looked like
[01:23:40] back in like 1.0 where is this look at
[01:23:42] this look at this look at this this is
[01:23:45] what my character list looked like okay
[01:23:48] so we have dude
[01:23:55] okay keep in mind
[01:23:58] I maxed my shangling in 1.1 I mastered I
[01:24:02] remember because not fully Max but like
[01:24:04] levelter because I wanted I was like she
[01:24:07] would probably be broken to melt all the
[01:24:08] crowd slimes in the cryo floor 12 and
[01:24:11] then I did and then we're like holy [ __ ]
[01:24:12] but that was after a little bit that was
[01:24:14] like experimenting the level 65 Amber
[01:24:16] was because the Jeff was like yo my
[01:24:18] Amber's better than your deluke and he
[01:24:20] was playing uh uh uh uh a sharpshooter's
[01:24:23] oath charge shotting Amber anyways We're
[01:24:26] not gonna talk about that uh we're not
[01:24:27] gonna talk about that uh so yeah we had
[01:24:29] child level Chichi level deluke level
[01:24:31] kitchen level true uh official yep uh
[01:24:34] because that was a dilute official
[01:24:35] player and then Charles came out uh
[01:24:37] Bennett because we knew he was broken
[01:24:38] venti because he was broken uh Kaya
[01:24:40] because I liked him and then in the
[01:24:42] non-level characters we have shangling
[01:24:44] sing Cho and Grandin okay singling was
[01:24:47] like
[01:24:48] back then fuel filter Crescent Pike
[01:24:50] physical but eventually I think in that
[01:24:52] patch I leveled her because it's like oh
[01:24:53] she'd probably be good against the crowd
[01:24:54] of slimes and then she was and then she
[01:24:56] was broken but that was after a bit uh
[01:24:57] Singh Cho everyone knew he was like
[01:24:59] broken with the Luke but every team
[01:25:01] needed him and I was like I don't want
[01:25:02] to do that so I didn't uh and then Beto
[01:25:04] I'm like 90 sure
[01:25:07] I didn't know what the [ __ ] Beto did
[01:25:09] back then uh like I I think no dude like
[01:25:11] I was like ah we got better I just
[01:25:13] didn't think about her but now I'm a
[01:25:15] Beto lover okay I've been a beta lover
[01:25:17] for a while I literally was just like
[01:25:26] yeah
[01:25:28] let's listen to my voice back then from
[01:25:30] Finance true but everything I say is 100
[01:25:32] kilograms and then eventually okay
[01:25:35] anyways
[01:25:39] I'll take Beto mid okay well that you
[01:25:41] can't just say an objectively bad take
[01:25:43] and type hot take in front of it
[01:25:46] hot take kazua bad it's like okay 650
[01:25:59] no
[01:26:03] you know what just cause that I'll show
[01:26:04] you my yellow flower look at this look
[01:26:06] at my yellow flower look at this look at
[01:26:07] this
[01:26:09] actually this is even better wait is it
[01:26:10] better I mean it depends if I need the
[01:26:12] ER
[01:26:13] yeah yeah there you go better than my
[01:26:15] Vermillion by the way literally better
[01:26:16] than my Vermillion
[01:26:22] foreign
[01:26:28] back to the event I was doing did I
[01:26:30] finish it
[01:26:36] it's not even on Eula I give my Eula
[01:26:39] Bill to freminate because they're
[01:26:40] basically the [ __ ]
[01:26:44] you're not gonna get bouncy this week
[01:26:45] yes I will
[01:26:47] I found Berry buff wear
[01:26:49] oh I have to do this [ __ ]
[01:26:58] what the [ __ ] do I get there
[01:27:14] punishment it's really not that high
[01:27:18] I haven't done the like The Meta things
[01:27:20] of like going to an event stacking your
[01:27:22] crit damage and getting like a million
[01:27:23] or two I probably should
[01:27:25] I think it's like 600 700k somewhere in
[01:27:28] there 650.
[01:27:30] quite following same with the one I
[01:27:33] didn't know there was an achievement
[01:27:34] that showed how many times you cleared
[01:27:35] the abyss and what I do I actually
[01:27:37] talked to the driver about this too and
[01:27:39] he does this a lot too where it's like I
[01:27:41] always reset before I finish 12-3 I
[01:27:43] always reset so I never like actually
[01:27:45] get the full Abyss clear so like when
[01:27:47] you look at like I don't know where it
[01:27:48] is but it's like clearly Abyss or some
[01:27:50] [ __ ]
[01:27:52] no where is it that it shows how many
[01:27:53] times you've done it
[01:27:58] I don't know whatever like I don't have
[01:28:00] it that high
[01:28:02] what is it stream time I didn't sleep

[01:57:32] he's like uh
[01:57:34] he's a K-pop Star so I was like what he
[01:57:37] is and then he gave me like
[01:57:39] like literally just two things
[01:57:41] [ __ ] cleanser and then another thing
[01:57:43] I don't know it's called
[01:57:45] I don't care
[01:57:51] long shoes to town for this okay I'll
[01:57:53] use the towel
[01:57:58] wait c100 what do you guys want
[01:58:00] I could do either

[01:58:06] Steven okay I got you
[01:58:08] Will Conquer it
[01:58:18] there you go Animo hotel I have no
[01:58:20] [ __ ] stamina
[01:58:30] displaying her Mastery over both fire
[01:58:32] and pole arms xiangling sends a pound
[01:58:35] how much you are on Xiao in this team uh
[01:58:38] I mean you don't really need that much
[01:58:40] you can go far as on too and then you're
[01:58:42] probably chilling
[01:58:47] true dark green in true little bits
[01:58:54] fire and burst damage
[01:58:57] teammate makes this game so easy
[01:59:02] you should run Eloy melts you know what
[01:59:06] sure man actually no no I almost did you
[01:59:09] almost got me but I'm good
[01:59:19] my nights
[01:59:22] don't go five hours on yeah I do
[01:59:25] uh I also forget that some people burst
[01:59:28] every year
[01:59:29] I mean there's no real reason not to
[01:59:30] okay like I use elegy sometimes like
[01:59:32] elegy is like the only exception but or
[01:59:34] if you're like C6 you can like go like a
[01:59:37] base attack weapon I guess but yeah
[01:59:44] have fun
[01:59:46] with this game
[01:59:51] and mobile player
[01:59:54] I mean okay it sounds like you don't
[01:59:56] want a player that just sounds like you
[01:59:58] don't want a player uh
[02:00:01] if you're like c0 hotel and you have to
[02:00:03] like jump cancel on mobile I've heard
[02:00:05] some people not like it I've heard
[02:00:07] others be like I play on mobile and it's
[02:00:09] and it's me and like you know it's up to
[02:00:11] you wrongly can help with that
[02:00:15] C1 can help with that
[02:00:21] um but yeah
[02:00:25] was one of the few five stars where I
[02:00:27] actually recommend you one
[02:00:29] like for a lot of characters it's like
[02:00:31] yeah if you have spare mod like Primo
[02:00:33] gems you can get C1 C2 whatever but like
[02:00:35] kutao I actually really recommend
[02:00:36] someone
[02:00:39] that's very good
[02:00:50] how'd you jump cancel you do
[02:00:54] normal charge and then you jump
[02:00:56] about I mean you do it with a child too
[02:00:58] like you do like normal at the punch
[02:00:59] sometimes just like that
[02:01:02] this is that
[02:01:10] dream work let's have fun with this [ __ ]
[02:01:12] yes you want without Ava's clip about
[02:01:15] why it's good but it's like it's not
[02:01:17] just quality of life it's also strictly
[02:01:18] better because so Dodge got things
[02:01:20] better but also let's use your stamina
[02:01:22] offensively because if you're drum
[02:01:24] canceling you need to dodge or run a
[02:01:25] shield character and it was you want
[02:01:26] it's like you no longer need the shield
[02:01:28] character as much you still can but you
[02:01:29] no longer like need it and dash casting
[02:01:31] is just better and you have more stamina
[02:01:33] and you can it's like comfier and it's
[02:01:35] also like you get to do like different
[02:01:37] combos well yeah it's just it's just
[02:01:40] yeah it's just everything it's mostly
[02:01:42] like
[02:01:44] you don't want to be running out of
[02:01:46] stamina ever
[02:01:48] so it's like any time you ever have to
[02:01:51] dodge at c0 it's like you lose DPS
[02:02:00] hey Loy an agile hunter from the Nora
[02:02:03] try with bowenham she's always ready to
[02:02:06] protect you why are you selling Eloy so
[02:02:09] hard dude
[02:02:13] what's with the goofy Graphics what are
[02:02:15] you talking about Bloom like some people
[02:02:16] play without Bloom on I think I think
[02:02:18] like okay if you're like a lot of PCS
[02:02:20] can't handle like Bloom and stuff that's
[02:02:22] fine but I feel like the graphics look
[02:02:24] better with Bloom the only thing I turn
[02:02:25] off is motion blur I think motion blur
[02:02:27] is disgusting but blue uh
[02:02:29] okay
[02:02:31] yeah okay this doesn't even look bad but
[02:02:34] it's not I'm just not used to it I'm
[02:02:35] just not used to it
[02:02:37] I think this looks goofier
[02:02:49] it's better
[02:02:51] um I don't know I mean I see why people
[02:02:53] like it I'm just not used to it
[02:02:56] foreign
[02:03:10] dude
[02:03:12] yes
[02:03:13] okay
[02:03:25] remember chat FPS is more important than
[02:03:28] Graphics so if you have to turn
[02:03:29] everything to low
[02:03:30] do it
[02:03:41] but also it's better to have like [ __ ]
[02:03:43] FPS but consistent than like varying I
[02:03:46] guess at least for games where like it
[02:03:48] matters because like if you're like
[02:03:50] spiking like if your ping is like
[02:03:51] consistent 30 it's better than like
[02:03:55] 30 35 40 50 and then like 10 and then
[02:03:58] like 60 and then like five and that's
[02:04:00] just like yeah your eyes are [ __ ]
[02:04:06] dude I used to when I was a kid or like
[02:04:09] I guess it was like 12 13.
[02:04:12] I was like I was a I was a nerd I played
[02:04:15] Starcraft too and uh I would have like
[02:04:18] seven to ten FPS and then whenever
[02:04:21] there's a team fight I would have to
[02:04:22] look away because it would be like one
[02:04:24] FPS or two so I literally had to like
[02:04:27] whenever there's like a fight happening
[02:04:28] I had to move my camera away from it
[02:04:30] because it would like overheat my laptop
[02:04:35] no
[02:04:39] so I feel the struggle if you guys are
[02:04:41] yeah yeah
[02:04:43] but it was still fun
[02:05:00] do you know there's a four months
[02:05:11] wait what's couscous is that like well
[02:05:14] we have a there's a middle eastern like
[02:05:16] side dish that's couscous I don't know
[02:05:18] if it's the same thing that's good I
[02:05:19] like it it's like a little like like uh
[02:05:22] like a starch or like vegetables and
[02:05:24] [ __ ]
[02:05:26] it was a different let me look it up
[02:05:29] oh yeah we have this too it's good
[02:05:41] recommended crit ratio for yolan
[02:05:45] okay I can see why this seems like a
[02:05:48] normal question but as high as you can
[02:05:51] go man like 30k HP as much PR as you
[02:05:53] need in your team and then one to two as
[02:05:55] high as you can go 7140 is a good or
[02:05:57] 6120 is a good goal if you don't have a
[02:06:00] current weapon but higher is better
[02:06:02] higher is better
[02:06:07] wait why is my HP so high am I on an HP
[02:06:09] circlet because I normally don't have
[02:06:11] that much without HP as a Hydra
[02:06:12] resonance it's my circuit HP
[02:06:15] yeah it is okay make sense
[02:06:20] she stands with crit yeah but you also
[02:06:21] want HP and ER so like it's a good
[02:06:23] starting point 7140 is like your goal
[02:06:25] and then higher is better
[02:06:39] time to go
[02:06:46] huh
[02:06:48] wait what the [ __ ] why are there pneumo
[02:06:50] blocks
[02:06:52] okay cool wow that was fun
[02:07:03] I want to be the Tory test subject no

[02:07:24] how do you deal with damage artifacts I
[02:07:27] love artifact also this gives me
[02:07:29] increased attack by 20 times three so
[02:07:32] 60.
[02:07:36] thank you
[02:07:38] you wanna see how broken Ben it is
[02:07:40] though

[02:07:42] damage
[02:07:48] look I'll do it here that was 24 right
[02:07:51] now look how much more we're gonna get
[02:07:52] also keep in mind we're gonna get
[02:07:53] attacked from this event so it's not
[02:07:54] really accurate but still
[02:07:57] 50 50 something
[02:08:00] 80 something

[02:14:17] talk as much because I'm either thinking
[02:14:19] more trying harder or Auto battling and
[02:14:22] then it's just like I don't know it's
[02:14:23] like the chat is more vacant

[02:14:29] it's like yeah some of the Chatters are
[02:14:31] like different and like there's some
[02:14:32] weird stuff but like
[02:14:34] it's also like

[02:21:46] dude circles are hard man circles are
[02:21:48] actually hard
[02:21:56] can someone explain the cave joke
[02:21:59] no
[02:22:09] 2000 HP we don't have a dealer
[02:22:15] it's over it's actually Joker if you
[02:22:17] guys think I can dodge every Scarlet
[02:22:19] actually no I can't I actually can watch
[02:22:20] this is gonna be a a dodging Master
[02:22:22] Class you guys are ready
[02:22:29] dodging master class I'll just I throw
[02:22:32] my penguin at him I attack e attack
[02:22:34] attack e
[02:22:36] oh I didn't even deal okay well
[02:22:40] oh
[02:22:53] hey
[02:22:56] not bad
[02:23:03] it's obvious who uses wrongly often dude
[02:23:06] I used to have that problem and then I
[02:23:08] forced myself I used to use your own
[02:23:09] time and then in the middle of like
[02:23:11] Inazuma patches I realized that it made
[02:23:13] me dog [ __ ] at the game because I no
[02:23:14] longer have to dodge so I no longer
[02:23:16] learned enemy patterns and I became way
[02:23:18] worse and then people would laugh at me
[02:23:19] so I now I've been like not using trying
[02:23:21] not to use wrongly and then back then
[02:23:23] there would be a magu Kanki every Abyss
[02:23:25] so I just like stopped using junglee and
[02:23:27] then had the [ __ ] brute force my way
[02:23:29] to learn mango kinkies so now every time
[02:23:30] I fight the magu hanky I know exactly
[02:23:32] how he's gonna act true me and Magoo we
[02:23:34] go way back
[02:23:38] and then what you do is you burst them
[02:23:40] all he does like them and then he'll
[02:23:42] he'll get like uh like a third certain
[02:23:44] HP threshold uh around like 66 it's a
[02:23:47] bit more it looks like 80 or some [ __ ] I
[02:23:48] don't know the exact number and then he
[02:23:50] stops he does
[02:23:52] and then they cry aways and that cry
[02:23:54] wave if you're close to him you have to
[02:23:56] like guess when it's gonna be and then
[02:23:57] you dodge to iframe it and if you're far
[02:23:59] you can react if you're far high paying
[02:24:01] this might be different but you can
[02:24:02] visually react for a bit far as soon as
[02:24:04] he goes down you dash forward then uh
[02:24:07] this Abyss kind of changed his uh
[02:24:09] pattern but generally when you attack
[02:24:11] him after that if you attack him he's
[02:24:13] gonna Dash backwards so you don't want
[02:24:14] to use your birds if you use your beta
[02:24:15] burst
[02:24:16] then he leaves the bed first and then
[02:24:18] you just wasted it so you want to wait
[02:24:20] till he dashes and then you trap him at
[02:24:22] the staircase behind the wall because
[02:24:23] then he won't Dash again because he's

[02:26:15] um well
[02:26:23] that's definitely a question
[02:26:26] the answer is probably hyperbloom
[02:26:32] you should be able to feed Dory to the
[02:26:34] strong box and then choose what artifact
[02:26:36] you get kind of like in Star rail where
[02:26:37] you can choose the piece
[02:26:39] but you should be able to choose the
[02:26:40] main stat too like the like force
[02:26:42] creation thing

[02:35:02] of my chat always asks me to play
[02:35:03] Shatter Albedo or Shadow razor you can
[02:35:05] play Shatter Albedo I think that'd be
[02:35:07] fun
[02:35:08] yeah Albedo and then you play like trong
[02:35:11] Yoon sing Cho
[02:35:14] ose
[02:35:16] this one guy my chat keeps asking me to
[02:35:19] play it
[02:35:21] I can't shatter bosses dude what do you
[02:35:23] saying is that any theme okay you're
[02:35:26] gonna play it okay you're gonna play
[02:35:27] You're Gonna okay you're gonna okay
[02:35:28] you're gonna okay you're gonna play
[02:35:30] windy plant so you can play any Nemo
[02:35:33] characters you want and any dendro
[02:35:34] characters you want and your goal is to
[02:35:36] swirl dentro and convince at least one
[02:35:38] new person in your chat that you can
[02:35:40] swirl dendro
[02:35:42] that's that's the team
[02:35:44] it can be a very vague team but that's
[02:35:46] what you gotta do
[02:35:48] good luck
[02:35:52] dude it's got another point where
[02:35:55] I don't do misinformation I mean don't
[02:35:57] listen you don't have to like be like
[02:35:59] okay [ __ ] you
[02:36:02] dude Fang
[02:36:04] was playing gentian and not like and
[02:36:06] sharing screen and obviously I saw the
[02:36:10] worst rotation known to man no big deal
[02:36:11] like you know we don't rotation chain
[02:36:13] people and then she swirled dendro and
[02:36:16] she even knew that it was called windy
[02:36:17] plant so I think it's catching on I
[02:36:19] think we need to keep we think we need
[02:36:21] to keep calling it with d plan
[02:36:27] okay listen
[02:36:30] I am not going to put someone on trial
[02:36:32] call me [ __ ] Farina the way we're
[02:36:34] entering the court of justice okay
[02:36:37] I listen psyog's BBG you typed only
[02:36:42] low quality comments and we bet we I
[02:36:45] personally give you a timeout to reflect
[02:36:47] and change I'm now going to look and see
[02:36:49] if you learned and improved your
[02:36:50] catalogs and if you didn't you will not
[02:36:53] just get the 10 minute ban you got
[02:36:54] before but a two week timeout and then
[02:36:57] if after that you come back and your
[02:36:59] quality of chat has not improved it will
[02:37:01] be permanent so let's look let me see

[02:37:23] the Stream I look you can be funny
[02:37:25] I can be unhinged but you have to be a
[02:37:28] respectable chatter because if not think
[02:37:31] of it as like if I chat if everyone in
[02:37:34] the Stream chatted like me would the
[02:37:36] stream be better or worse and in this
[02:37:38] instance I would argue that it would be
[02:37:40] worse let me close my wallpaper engine

[02:40:41] all of our resin in Golden troop and
[02:40:43] Mario see hopefully we get good pieces
[02:40:45] because I really need them
[02:40:47] for current characters and probably
[02:40:49] future ones and then after we're gonna
[02:40:51] go strong box maybe and do some
[02:40:53] Vermilion is the fun this could be good
[02:40:56] and we'll roll them all at the end true

[02:41:07] this oh we can't do it in a domain
[02:41:08] though we gotta do that after
[02:41:11] um I do remember
[02:41:13] by the way by the way I remember I got
[02:41:16] good pieces off streams in the live
[02:41:18] stream that we could roll just to see if
[02:41:21] they're good or not uh for example this
[02:41:23] now you might be like who the [ __ ] wants
[02:41:25] a HP goblet I don't know but you know
[02:41:27] might be good who knows I literally like
[02:41:29] it probably won't be but I'm just saying
[02:41:30] you know we might as well level pieces
[02:41:32] so uh we're gonna start with this
[02:41:34] feather probably won't be good but it
[02:41:35] could be my official desperately needs a
[02:41:38] golden set
[02:41:42] uh what's hot on
[02:41:47] DMs
[02:41:50] sounds good man

[02:42:24] yes if I so I'm not watching anything
[02:42:27] right now I answer here but do you want
[02:42:28] to run domains together because we never
[02:42:30] stream at the same time um
[02:42:34] um
[02:42:42] if I get a good artifact if I don't bad
[02:42:45] luck
[02:42:47] or maybe the other way around
[02:42:59] oh I got this too dude this could be
[02:43:02] this could be this could be DPS nahida
[02:43:05] in a freemony team we could put fremin a
[02:43:08] on uh uh deepwood and then to heat up
[02:43:11] never mind

[02:43:21] this okay we got this i got this we got
[02:43:23] that off stream
[02:43:25] and like I don't think I'm gonna use

[02:43:30] the archon of HP
[02:43:34] nilu
[02:43:43] dude there's a chance what if it only

[02:43:48] I mean
[02:43:49] this could be good
[02:43:51] it's like okay
[02:44:07] yeah
[02:44:10] it's not ideal also it's an HP goblet so
[02:44:13] it's like most characters that want crit

[02:55:28] means you can versus wrongly that's
[02:55:30] pretty based let me look what kind of
[02:55:31] resin
[02:55:37] dude you can like you can play him as
[02:55:39] emotional support in a hyperloom team
[02:55:45] I don't need emotional support do you
[02:55:48] have child yeah right
[02:55:51] legal donated three dollars opinion on
[02:55:54] HSR getting new permanent content with
[02:55:57] the new Su having voiced side requests
[02:56:00] and overall better stories shut up fans
[02:56:02] get nothing while still fighting against
[02:56:04] the deaths wait okay okay and not to get
[02:56:07] sidetracked by a Dono mid-call but you
[02:56:09] can't say starrail has better story than
[02:56:11] gunshin I'm sorry I I'm actually sorry
[02:56:12] you can't combat like the dude the Swarm
[02:56:16] mode sure
[02:56:18] it's even worse you could say honkai but
[02:56:21] staryl is no way wait the story in Star
[02:56:23] well is even worse than in Genji no way
[02:56:25] dude why you hit it okay catch it okay
[02:56:28] okay just pretend you know Zuma didn't
[02:56:29] happen
[02:56:30] pretending Zuma did not happen okay have
[02:56:33] you done Lydia's Quest by the way no no
[02:56:36] I've done like the Ark on quests I
[02:56:37] started doing it and then I got bored
[02:56:39] because it was like really boring
[02:56:42] and like I heard that it gets better
[02:56:44] later but like I just thought because I
[02:56:46] was bored
[02:56:47] hey why are you playing Lynette I don't
[02:56:49] know I need friendship if you want I can
[02:56:51] play naida yeah
[02:56:58] you really don't know the story anyways
[02:56:59] I I I started doing it and then I got I
[02:57:02] got like bored because the pacing was
[02:57:04] just really bad
[02:57:05] yeah and then like three times I got
[02:57:09] commission blocked because I was the
[02:57:11] character was busy with the linear Quest
[02:57:12] so I just [ __ ] mocked through it
[02:57:16] why would they load commissions behind
[02:57:19] quests
[02:57:22] yeah so I have I have regions of the map
[02:57:25] that I avoid because if I go I get uh
[02:57:28] cutscenes
[02:57:35] Dale will start talking to me
[02:57:38] there's this one Subaru Commission in
[02:57:40] the desert where if I go too close Dale
[02:57:42] starts talking to me
[02:57:43] so I have to alter for
[02:57:51] okay I did like the to the Chatter's ass
[02:57:54] guy did like the star rail Quest the
[02:57:56] last one or the last story Quest was
[02:57:57] like Ting Yoon I think that one was sick
[02:57:59] but
[02:58:04] as I said they're gonna give us
[02:58:06] Ender games and not against you and
[02:58:08] they'll be like yo go play our other
[02:58:09] game which I like their other games too
[02:58:11] true so but I'm just saying
[02:58:24] is that a good artifact
[02:58:33] true me too
[02:58:35] Oh Me Oh I thought you were that okay no
[02:58:37] I got I got out of the four stater7 Nick
[02:58:40] okay I got a crit damage em for Saturn
[02:58:43] on a flower so I lock it because it
[02:58:44] might be good I used to never love like
[02:58:46] I always leveled those but I always
[02:58:47] thought it was too copium but then I got
[02:58:49] a 40 crit damage flower and now every
[02:58:50] time I show it it's a Pepe W so I might
[02:58:52] as well get another
[02:59:02] cheating and using the energy
[02:59:09] well I literally haven't used MRE once
[02:59:12] oh wait I forgot
[02:59:14] true
[02:59:16] nicely heal I was like what the uh
[02:59:20] sorry my screen's not black
[02:59:27] you can choose
[02:59:35] you know Zuma had best story out of all
[02:59:39] regions
[02:59:42] okay I okay I've noticed that like
[02:59:46] throughout the like most normal like
[02:59:49] casual Genji players they all really
[02:59:51] like or Mo a lot of them really liking
[02:59:52] Azuma but like dude you can like their
[02:59:55] beauty like oh it's a beautiful region
[02:59:56] oh the characters are sick but there is
[02:59:59] no way the story is better
[03:00:04] like I like I like writing I like yai as
[03:00:07] like design wise I think kokomi is
[03:00:09] kokomi you know there's a lot of
[03:00:11] characters I like I love kokomi but you
[03:00:14] can't be like this story is better
[03:00:16] hey you like it what's wrong with it you
[03:00:19] can do some introspection not every
[03:00:21] answer has to be given to you
[03:00:25] personal preference is the thing you
[03:00:27] don't need to [ __ ] on them no I can [ __ ]
[03:00:28] on people's opinions I can you can have
[03:00:30] wrong opinions that's true
[03:00:32] some people wake up every day and choose
[03:00:34] the charge attack
[03:00:36] uh sorry charge shot game shot
[03:00:39] yeah but then he's different
[03:00:43] he's different
[03:00:45] ain't no way
[03:00:49] okay I mean even I hate charging I'm
[03:00:52] just playing Lenny because he's cool
[03:00:53] Lenny has ribs
[03:01:05] only a few days ago that rizz stands for
[03:01:08] curriculum
[03:01:10] I didn't know that
[03:01:12] uh yeah I knew that but it's also kind
[03:01:15] of just like it's kind of devolved from
[03:01:18] what it's supposed to mean
[03:01:19] ah
[03:01:21] true now it stands for sexual harassment
[03:01:24] true
[03:01:26] real Saj
[03:01:30] none of us Lauren the best story setup
[03:01:32] and they [ __ ] it up spectacularly in
[03:01:33] the archon quest
[03:01:35] definitely yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna
[03:01:38] leave it here I'm not gonna elaborate
[03:01:40] further what if I fell off though
[03:01:43] you can elaborate
[03:01:47] listen I still enjoyed the region
[03:01:53] I was definitely not a sumeru
[03:01:56] dude Subaru pre-desert was Peak
[03:01:58] I don't care I agree actually Peak
[03:02:02] they just needed to voice the r on our
[03:02:04] Quest so people would realize
[03:02:11] it was like literally
[03:02:15] get it then it was the people that
[03:02:17] disagree okay the people that disagree
[03:02:19] are like what I would be if I play this
[03:02:21] game as a non-streamer and spam my space
[03:02:24] bar and didn't read anything because it
[03:02:25] was long as [ __ ] so like if you don't
[03:02:27] care about it it's annoying but if you
[03:02:29] actually read it and care about it it's
[03:02:30] actually the best I don't care
[03:02:33] You can disagree and I will respect your
[03:02:35] wrong opinion that's fine
[03:02:39] yeah but okay my problem is Dragon spine
[03:02:42] so long ago that I don't remember half
[03:02:43] of it but I do remember liking it and
[03:02:46] then dying to sheer cold every time I
[03:02:47] all tab
[03:02:52] oh no
[03:02:54] when I
[03:02:56] stop playing the game
[03:02:58] wait critical damage attack circuit
[03:03:05] hey Nick
[03:03:06] what
[03:03:08] you know what Minecraft is
[03:03:10] yeah you wanna play why don't you
[03:03:12] Minecraft right now
[03:03:15] you don't need credit on that set shut
[03:03:17] the [ __ ] up I can run my Lenny with the
[03:03:19] new crit damage bow that I just got and
[03:03:22] then [ __ ] damage stop shots and maybe
[03:03:25] eventually there's gonna be a character
[03:03:27] that's released
[03:03:28] that wants that set in the
[03:03:31] doesn't all descend with Great Brain
[03:03:33] yeah maybe that might happen who knows
[03:03:36] I'm gonna eat first because
[03:03:40] no there's no way to know but like it'd
[03:03:43] be cool that'd be cool
[03:03:46] I mean they wouldn't release a new set
[03:03:48] for a new region unless it's for
[03:03:49] multiple characters so you know
[03:03:56] I always forget
[03:03:59] this glow
[03:04:02] it's definitely a set
[03:04:05] it was actually definitely two
[03:04:15] it is yeah it is actually a new
[03:04:16] two-piece it's true
[03:04:19] the event
[03:04:21] which one
[03:04:23] I like it
[03:04:26] I've only done it once though with ciao
[03:04:28] fars on Bennett Kazo
[03:04:30] that would have been only done it once

[03:21:01] official and then the circle for maybe a
[03:21:04] sword of someone
[03:21:07] but I don't know who
[03:21:09] so let's start the fire
[03:21:12] actually we'll start with the worst
[03:21:13] flower just in case

[03:24:54] foreign
[03:24:56] 39 we're gonna do another wave of
[03:24:58] Vermillion strongbox because what could
[03:25:00] go wrong honestly it's Vermillion
[03:25:02] everyone loves Vermillion

[03:25:08] whatever we'll did after this
[03:25:10] actually fine we'll just Auto out after
[03:25:14] I don't want to [ __ ] up the order where
[03:25:16] is it wait which set
[03:25:18] out of double crochet I
[03:25:21] did I not level it I thought I leveled
[03:25:22] it
[03:25:23] wait no I'm dumb I didn't level it did I
[03:25:25] just unlock it oh no I just didn't level
[03:25:27] it what the [ __ ] what did I love oh I
[03:25:28] loved the goblet
[03:25:30] thank you oh no I leveled another flower
[03:25:32] that's why okay
[03:25:35] all right let's level it
[03:25:41] I mean I guess it could just only roll
[03:25:43] yeah I'm like the other pieces but
[03:25:44] that's not gonna happen
[03:25:48] dude you look at
[03:25:49] look it's already juicy it
[03:25:54] are useful
[03:25:57] now please roll crit I don't want
[03:25:59] another incident no incidents who's this
[03:26:02] piece for official yay Miko oh anyone
[03:26:07] okay this is fine pretty low rolls but
[03:26:09] this is fine
[03:26:24] for long like the prime this role is for
[03:26:26] you we're about to get crit rate for you
[03:26:28] this crit rate is for you
[03:26:32] it's fine attack's not bad attack's not
[03:26:33] bad official likes attack yeah Nico
[03:26:35] likes attack
[03:26:36] technically nahida I mean she doesn't
[03:26:38] really want to attack but I mean
[03:26:49] thank you
[03:26:53] all right this is going to be the
[03:26:54] crittery roll I just I thought about it
[03:26:56] earlier when I actually
[03:26:58] okay
[03:27:01] um
[03:27:03] [ __ ]
[03:27:05] well I mean okay it's still fine it's
[03:27:09] still fine it's still fine it's still
[03:27:11] fine
[03:27:13] it's a lot of stats let's say it gets
[03:27:15] crit damage again
[03:27:16] thank you
[03:27:18] the only reason why I'm like on the
[03:27:20] fence about it is because my official
[03:27:22] right now insane amazing for almost
[03:27:25] perfect
[03:27:26] but not on the right set so even if the
[03:27:28] set is better I would need to have a
[03:27:30] good substance for it to actually be
[03:27:31] better but it's usually like it could be
[03:27:32] up to 20 better so
[03:27:35] it's worth it
[03:27:36] like even if our subsides are a bit
[03:27:38] worse it could still be better
[03:27:44] yeah right now official she has a good
[03:27:46] Thunder Soother and a good two-piece
[03:27:47] Vermillion to be thundering Fury I have
[03:27:50] a few official sets I could go
[03:27:52] and I also have a golden uh gilded but
[03:27:54] hopefully this is better
[03:27:56] we want to see okay if I'm gonna be
[03:27:59] honest if I see a crit roll here it's
[03:28:00] still good if it's ER attack it's Doom
[03:28:03] but crit
[03:28:04] okay that's a low roll but
[03:28:06] okay this looks disgusting but it's not
[03:28:09] bad it's a lot of low rolls but it's not
[03:28:11] bad it's
[03:28:13] it looks worse than it is you ever see
[03:28:16] something that's like functional but
[03:28:18] it's like hanging by a thread it's like
[03:28:19] rusted it's like it works but it's not
[03:28:23] like luxurious
[03:28:24] that's this piece
[03:28:27] it's okay it's it's the crit value is
[03:28:30] like 20 but it also has some attack ER
[03:28:31] role
[03:28:35] it's okay
[03:28:46] it's okay
[03:28:51] I'm probably never gonna use it if I'm
[03:28:53] being honest but you know it's better
[03:28:55] than nothing no it isn't I would rather
[03:28:57] have the Mora and the artifact exp but
[03:28:59] it's okay Vermillion
[03:29:02] all right the first Vermilion roll of
[03:29:05] many
[03:29:06] okay right off the bat I would like to
[03:29:08] disclose that our show still needs
[03:29:10] either a good goblet or a good flower to
[03:29:12] be perfect the other piece we can use
[03:29:13] offset
[03:29:14] so all the other other pieces well we
[03:29:16] could be good could be upgrades
[03:29:19] probably won't uh aren't as they're not
[03:29:22] as important to me as the flower of the
[03:29:23] Goblet so we're gonna start with the
[03:29:24] sense okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
[03:29:27] okay
[03:29:28] now reminder
[03:29:31] every bad piece we get could be an
[03:29:33] emblem piece
[03:29:35] that could be good
[03:29:36] that could be good Circle it nope Circle
[03:29:40] it nope feather nope an email called it

[03:38:45] like I genuinely look I'm gonna show
[03:38:47] this on stream right now this is like my
[03:38:49] worst personality trait that I'm trying
[03:38:50] to fix I have look these are my friends
[03:38:52] that I'm not responding to right now
[03:38:54] because I don't have time like I am a
[03:38:56] bad friend I acknowledge it I'm trying
[03:38:57] to do better but like I legit don't
[03:38:58] check DM sometimes like this is my
[03:39:00] editor this is my graphic designer these
[03:39:01] are like friends like it's like it's not
[03:39:03] that I don't care it's like sometimes
[03:39:04] I'm like overloaded with life right now
[03:39:06] and I'm like very stressed and I'm not
[03:39:07] trying to like put an excuse to explain
[03:39:09] why I'm a bad friend I'm sorry I'll try
[03:39:11] to be there for people and to do better
[03:39:13] I just did not see your message I'm
[03:39:14] sorry like I'm telling you I wouldn't
[03:39:16] make this up I literally did not open it
[03:39:20] it's fine I forgive you I mean I forgave
[03:39:22] you last time I was just wanted to
[03:39:24] trolley a bit okay I know because I do
[03:39:26] feel bad like I this is literally my
[03:39:28] worst part of me is like I leave people
[03:39:30] on the side like I unwillingly like go
[03:39:34] into these like not spiral it's not like
[03:39:35] that bad but it's like I just like grind
[03:39:37] something and I don't think about
[03:39:38] anything else and then when I come back
[03:39:39] out it's like my grandma's like you
[03:39:41] haven't called me in a week I'm like I'm
[03:39:43] sorry like I'm not trying to be an
[03:39:44] [ __ ] but like I'm trying to do better
[03:39:46] so I'm sorry I still love you
[03:39:48] you will be better don't worry thanks
[03:39:50] man but quick mention please okay
[03:39:54] all right but yeah
[03:39:56] with your sponsored what the [ __ ] wait
[03:39:58] now
[03:40:00] why do you have gunshin on your like no
[03:40:03] the thing from oh that was uh the
[03:40:05] Fontana release but I kept it because I
[03:40:07] mean I like dungeon
[03:40:09] this team isn't sponsored though but I
[03:40:11] have not played against him since
[03:40:14] um what is the card girl name like the
[03:40:17] Box yeah yeah well I thought you're
[03:40:19] gonna come back for Fontana what
[03:40:20] happened
[03:40:22] um I was just like
[03:40:24] if like because I just saw like so many
[03:40:26] streamers after like 1K average viewers
[03:40:28] with dead communities get sponsored by
[03:40:30] Hojo and I'm like okay if I wanna like I
[03:40:33] really want to play against him but I
[03:40:35] refuse to give hoyo like free promotion
[03:40:37] by playing it because whenever I play it
[03:40:39] I talk about it on stream and I get
[03:40:41] people to play it I probably I streamed
[03:40:43] against you like twice or Thrice on my
[03:40:46] end in my entire life
[03:40:48] 100 I got more people into this game
[03:40:50] than any against him streamer okay whoa
[03:40:53] I carry this game on my [ __ ] back
[03:41:00] you give content to people that play
[03:41:02] this game like all day every day okay
[03:41:04] yeah well okay actually if you have an
[03:41:06] agency I can tell you this a bit more
[03:41:07] often but like I've heard that well I've
[03:41:10] seen a lot of non-getter streamers get
[03:41:11] sponsored so like you could ask if
[03:41:13] there's like deals because I know some
[03:41:15] agencies will be like yo who's like
[03:41:17] wants to stream gentian that's not
[03:41:19] against a streamer and then some people
[03:41:20] would be like Oh I'm down and then so
[03:41:21] you could probably like figure one out
[03:41:25] I saw dude I saw like Valor and players
[03:41:27] streaming engine
[03:41:28] but I so [ __ ] could not streaming
[03:41:30] again [ __ ] it's like what is that like
[03:41:32] what is the point okay chat listen type
[03:41:35] one if you agree it's pointless to
[03:41:37] sponsor people like that never played
[03:41:40] again because they are just gonna stream
[03:41:42] like boring Monster tutorial which is
[03:41:44] giga outdated why not sponsor a guy like
[03:41:47] I don't know me I have all the
[03:41:49] characters in the game
[03:41:52] I can do our best and I have like the
[03:41:56] new region that you want to showcase not
[03:41:58] yet the dance I could showcase it which
[03:41:59] people can look forward though when
[03:42:01] starting the game I can Wing man for you
[03:42:03] I've actually I've actually seen yeah so
[03:42:05] there's the the new people that just
[03:42:07] start usually it's like they don't like
[03:42:08] that much and then it's not like good
[03:42:09] promo but I've seen some streamers like
[03:42:11] actually get addicted
[03:42:14] I saw like a league streamer there's a
[03:42:17] giga try harder solo queue player I saw
[03:42:19] him get sponsored I'm like oh another
[03:42:21] monster Andy and he was actually like
[03:42:23] ar58 and everything I'm like wow this
[03:42:25] guy is also like a game aware
[03:42:28] wait 58 Jesus
[03:42:30] he's called agorin
[03:42:33] no I don't know did I [ __ ] off people
[03:42:35] okay I like Troll and like violence
[03:42:37] sometimes because my name I have again
[03:42:39] ciao hey this is weird you're gonna
[03:42:41] judge me but I have one called John one
[03:42:42] called the Tory and they'll be like
[03:42:44] people will be like oh you play gentian
[03:42:45] and I'll be like what's your AR and
[03:42:47] they'll be like I'm addicted I'm 52 and
[03:42:49] then I'm like I've been 60 for a year
[03:42:53] oh where
[03:42:54] bro Jesus Christ will you play valoranda
[03:42:57] screams I gamble on CS go do you win
[03:43:00] dude I've actually fell down the
[03:43:02] loophole of Cs go Skins I don't buy them
[03:43:04] but like I've been watching
[03:43:07] I am Giga into the loop holder I I am
[03:43:09] like I talk with so many like big
[03:43:11] Traders it's so fun
[03:43:14] it's like it's so easy to make like just
[03:43:17] like they all show on me like you know
[03:43:19] ways they're just like really print
[03:43:21] money it's not even gambling right
[03:43:23] because I don't like most of the time
[03:43:26] it's not even gambling
[03:43:28] no because I don't make money by
[03:43:30] gambling on it like I I make money on CS
[03:43:33] go then I gambled away for fun
[03:43:35] so I don't feel bad about it because if
[03:43:37] I actually took money out of my like you
[03:43:38] know savings account and everything I
[03:43:40] would feel bad
[03:43:41] yeah I mean I guess that makes sense
[03:43:45] sometimes fun concerned
[03:43:48] guys gamble it's fun
[03:43:51] it's an easy way this is why I do
[03:43:53] artifacts
[03:43:54] in the game
[03:43:55] you can't put in game wait do you want
[03:43:58] me to roll an artifact for you
[03:44:00] yeah sure how would you like fun things
[03:44:02] so far I've I actually like it
[03:44:06] um okay if you had to choose 2.0 3.0 or
[03:44:10] 4.0 okay the initial hype of 2.0 was the
[03:44:13] highest because it was the first new
[03:44:14] region but
[03:44:19] I don't know I really like Montana I'm
[03:44:22] trying to think okay with with 3.0 I
[03:44:24] think 3.1 was better than 3.0 because
[03:44:26] the characters were better and then
[03:44:28] people are more hyped for it same with I
[03:44:29] think 4.1 4.0 is pretty lit
[03:44:32] but we're also getting
[03:44:34] I think most people will say 4.0 over
[03:44:36] 3.0 but I'm like a I like dendro a lot
[03:44:39] so I'm 3.0 but
[03:44:41] next Patch's characters let's see
[03:44:44] oh yeah it's like the two like taller
[03:44:46] men yeah and then archon is probably
[03:44:48] four point two like we don't know but I
[03:44:50] assume archons 4.2
[03:44:52] clueless we don't know no dude we don't
[03:44:54] but our cons usually come whatever you
[03:44:56] need to come in the point too
[03:44:59] but uh
[03:45:02] uh
[03:45:06] okay I'm Gonna Roll another pack for you
[03:45:07] okay this is a beauty this is four stats
[03:45:09] crit rate
[03:45:12] and then if it's good the editor is
[03:45:14] gonna have to edit this into a video so
[03:45:18] yeah
[03:45:20] look I'll do one roll for you
[03:45:22] do you want me to share screen or do you
[03:45:23] want to live with [ __ ] stream delay
[03:45:25] how much delay do you have none but
[03:45:28] it's like standard whatever are you are
[03:45:30] you running a [ __ ] no okay I thought
[03:45:32] you were rolling a purple
[03:45:33] oh no dude look at this [ __ ] this is so
[03:45:36] good as long as this is real HP that's
[03:45:39] [ __ ] good
[03:45:41] okay great great okay the only problem
[03:45:42] okay look this is the okay the only
[03:45:44] before disclaimer before I roll this
[03:45:46] feather the last good piece I got was
[03:45:47] this which is [ __ ] insane so now I
[03:45:50] don't even need another feather and this
[03:45:51] is after getting one two three four five
[03:45:54] six seven eight nine ten eleven others
[03:45:56] but you know that's what it is 1400 HP
[03:45:59] no big deal the
[03:46:02] said that is better than Vermilion why
[03:46:04] are you still using shut the [ __ ] up
[03:46:06] it's actually not bad okay it's
[03:46:07] sometimes it's usually about as good
[03:46:08] it's not really better in the team I
[03:46:10] play it's not better it's like
[03:46:12] very similar though but it's not better
[03:46:15] also vermillions in the straw box it's
[03:46:17] more efficient don't shut the [ __ ] up
[03:46:19] I'm not anyways Chris damage oh what is
[03:46:23] it
[03:46:25] what is Daniel
[03:46:27] dude
[03:46:31] bro you're just plus eight in like why
[03:46:34] are you like going because because uh
[03:46:44] this is good this is good this is
[03:46:46] actually good one ER roll is what it is
[03:46:51] wait this is not even dude this is
[03:46:53] actually good so one more roll it's good
[03:46:55] it's 40 CV if it goes one motor yeah
[03:46:59] that's good
[03:47:01] the only problem with Vermillion is
[03:47:03] literally no one else wants the set like
[03:47:05] used to be with like two-piece on Fishel
[03:47:07] or like yai but now they both got a new
[03:47:09] set so it's like
[03:47:11] uh uh I don't know who I'd use this on
[03:47:14] if it misses but surely it just hits
[03:47:16] crit and then I use it on chow
[03:47:20] scream so you probably didn't hit it oh
[03:47:23] [ __ ]
[03:47:25] oh [ __ ] oh GG never mind wait
[03:47:27] wait this is [ __ ] good wait it's not
[03:47:30] better than the last one though is it I
[03:47:31] don't dude what the [ __ ]
[03:47:33] okay
[03:47:37] wait I'm not doing a fan bull wait wait
[03:47:39] that's 40 wait wait let me see if it's
[03:47:42] better or not
[03:47:44] it might actually be better because the
[03:47:45] ER okay it depends [ __ ] dude [ __ ]
[03:47:55] okay so I think the old one is

[03:55:48] everyone
[03:55:49] from everywhere which isn't bad but it's
[03:55:52] like twitch is like it feels like a
[03:55:53] community of like kind of like not to be
[03:55:55] parasocial but like almost like a family
[03:55:57] where it's like people are like in the

[03:56:34] like I don't even understand what you
[03:56:36] were talking about okay
[03:56:48] where it's like people will just be like
[03:56:51] just blatantly sexist or just like
[03:56:54] yeah just like kekona but it is what it
[03:56:57] is I guess well it isn't well yeah it's
[03:56:59] bad but like
[03:57:06] no need to name drop even because you
[03:57:08] guys know who it is like imagine having
[03:57:10] a chat like children it's like 60 plus
[03:57:12] thousand people but all your chat is
[03:57:14] just like www

[03:58:15] gears
[03:58:17] you know what other City okay what is
[03:58:19] number one thing you hate as a streamer
[03:58:22] like period like like when someone says
[03:58:25] on chat
[03:58:26] my my like the thing that actually gets
[03:58:29] my blood boiling is When someone tells
[03:58:31] me like shut up like and then others
[03:58:33] it's like I am on my stream
[03:58:39] a guy saying shut up people will ask me
[03:58:43] a question and then be like who asked oh
[03:58:47] I hate move on that's true so I'm gonna
[03:58:48] try to point out I hate when I'm talking
[03:58:50] about something that I'm pissed about
[03:58:51] and I was like move on it's like dude
[03:58:53] let me [ __ ] vent also imposter
[03:58:57] also [ __ ] um I hate when people
[03:59:02] try to drama bait between streamers like
[03:59:04] oh do you see what this person said I
[03:59:06] don't care what your [ __ ] favorite
[03:59:07] series on I don't care also people go
[03:59:10] see showcases on their favorite [ __ ]
[03:59:12] app of some random ass character getting
[03:59:14] food boosted and be like oh you said
[03:59:16] Eula was bad but she did a million
[03:59:18] damage I don't care she can go [ __ ]
[03:59:20] herself with you I do not care what you
[03:59:23] saw on your other [ __ ] app shut the
[03:59:25] [ __ ] up and don't bring that here
[03:59:27] because then it also so no it could be
[03:59:29] YouTube too it's not just like Tick Tock
[03:59:30] because it also brings hate to them
[03:59:32] because then it's like oh and then it
[03:59:34] just starts a randomized war that no one
[03:59:35] cares about
[03:59:37] now in the league especially like when
[03:59:40] you're playing
[03:59:43] I just like
[03:59:51] you know I have like 10 people come to
[03:59:53] my chat and be like did you know you're

[04:00:07] history

[04:01:17] hello
[04:01:19] he's playing a weirdo games
[04:01:33] for that one clip yeah if you think I'm
[04:01:36] going Voice without without
[04:01:38] impact you're [ __ ] wrong okay it was
[04:01:42] worth League engine like as a streamer
[04:01:46] gets a lot of [ __ ] I'm like sometimes
[04:01:48] rightfully so but like I feel like at
[04:01:50] least my chat
[04:01:52] feels less
[04:01:54] bad like okay sometimes there's like the
[04:01:57] weirdos that like are like like weird
[04:02:00] about like child characters like that
[04:02:02] you have to ban and they're like some
[04:02:03] weirdos but like I feel like League chat
[04:02:05] is like
[04:02:06] sometimes because
[04:02:13] I would take being a league streamer
[04:02:16] over any day like against him because I
[04:02:20] mean let's just look at your streaming
[04:02:22] hours and then look mine yeah yeah yeah
[04:02:24] there is like infinite content but you
[04:02:26] also have to be good though like you
[04:02:28] can't just be like
[04:02:29] I mean I guess yeah yeah I mean
[04:02:32] I mean I mean you just click queue up
[04:02:34] and the content makes itself meanwhile
[04:02:35] you you have to be here for the last
[04:02:38] hour you've been studying at artifacts
[04:02:40] because I'm trying to roll them but I
[04:02:42] can't get it okay
[04:02:43] sorry I'll keep rolling them
[04:02:49] I've seen some toxic engine streamers
[04:02:50] yeah but if you're a toxic interesting
[04:02:52] you have to like choose to be toxic
[04:02:53] because like who's provoking you like
[04:02:56] what are you doing going out of your way
[04:02:57] to be angry
[04:03:00] [Music]
[04:03:02] we're not starting [ __ ] today we are I
[04:03:05] am not getting clipped this is not
[04:03:07] happening I am not getting clipped we
[04:03:10] are not doing this
[04:03:12] he has the Jeff true
[04:03:23] sounds funny but how they play
[04:03:26] oh this flower got defense
[04:03:29] well
[04:03:33] something
[04:03:41] I heard that they knew a benefit catch
[04:03:43] level of good like from fishing oh
[04:03:47] we don't like there's no character right
[04:03:49] now like dude what the [ __ ] there's no
[04:03:51] like shangling character right now that
[04:03:53] could use it but like it is it's
[04:03:55] basically the same as catch kind of but
[04:03:57] for skill and a sword so like if there's
[04:04:00] a there's probably gonna be a future
[04:04:01] character that'll like want it but like
[04:04:03] right now it's not really needed
[04:04:06] but also there's festering desire do you
[04:04:09] know what festering desire is it's like
[04:04:10] oh patch 1.2 yeah it's which is
[04:04:12] basically like that but better
[04:04:16] wait the new one is better the new one
[04:04:19] gives ER right it's wait what is it
[04:04:21] called and uh fishing sword
[04:04:26] yeah it gives ER
[04:04:29] whereas the 13 months of festering Union
[04:04:33] desire anterior is yeah I guess another
[04:04:35] skill could rate an energy recharge
[04:04:37] whereas this one gives Elemental skill
[04:04:38] damage anchored rate so like this should
[04:04:41] be better
[04:04:42] but it depends on who
[04:04:46] the only event weapon I am pleased about
[04:04:48] missing is the elevator one yeah yeah if
[04:04:50] you miss out because that's a slot you
[04:04:52] you're [ __ ] have fun using a
[04:04:54] three-star weapon
[04:04:59] is good
[04:05:02] but yeah if you missed this is such I
[04:05:06] didn't play against scene when it was
[04:05:07] about aka before sumero I mean I did
[04:05:10] play a bit of Inazuma
[04:05:12] but the holy city nazima was so bad it's
[04:05:15] just like dude I'm not gonna comment on
[04:05:18] that dude I mentioned I mentioned
[04:05:19] earlier in this video I mentioned that
[04:05:20] [ __ ]
[04:05:21] that I didn't like inazuma's archon
[04:05:23] Quest compared to like Sumer and [ __ ]
[04:05:25] and people were mad I don't I don't know
[04:05:26] question mark I think I think people SIM
[04:05:28] for the Inazuma characters too much I
[04:05:30] like the characters I like that like
[04:05:31] story like the the like idea of it I
[04:05:34] like the like area but I feel like that
[04:05:36] it fell off like story wise what do you
[04:05:38] mean the character reserves you think so
[04:05:40] Bland like yeah but they look good and
[04:05:44] that's what matters to most players
[04:05:46] oh like I think kokomi's good but you
[04:05:49] told me they ruined her in the story
[04:05:50] Quest I haven't done it
[04:05:52] I haven't done Quest
[04:05:55] this is just another traveler theme
[04:05:57] nothing else that's right
[04:06:00] ayata was goated because he wasn't on
[04:06:02] Traveler theme
[04:06:05] in his study
[04:06:07] uh oh yeah I hate the story I remember
[04:06:10] yeah I mean I I can't lie I was bored at
[04:06:13] all the talking but that's just me my
[04:06:15] fault as a player so I'm not faulting

[04:30:02] dude where the [ __ ] is my
[04:30:07] I have a crafting table in my house
[04:30:10] there dude you're trolling
[04:30:13] oh it's oh wait it's right in the middle
[04:30:15] what the [ __ ] there's no way it was just
[04:30:17] in the middle
[04:30:21] dude how did I not I saw it it's right
[04:30:25] here okay I actually got it it's the
[04:30:27] fusion of Nouveau and veal the ls should
[04:30:30] pre-pronounce
[04:30:38] so a video where a guy called Misses
[04:30:40] naviette's name is the future of Nouveau
[04:30:43] and Vil
[04:30:46] that should be pronounced as nouveau
[04:30:51] what
[04:30:52] that's how it works Blastoise is blast
[04:30:56] and tortoise his name isn't blastus it's
[04:30:59] Blastoise that's not how [ __ ] words
[04:31:01] work
[04:31:05] also Nev is a word like it
[04:31:10] it's not the same as Nouveau like you
[04:31:13] could say like Keck shows the Neff or
[04:31:16] Nev in shows Nev so it's like it's a
[04:31:19] different word it like means kind of the
[04:31:21] same thing like it means new but it's a
[04:31:23] different word
[04:31:29] like if anything would Bev
