[00:05:23] uh uh uh uh uh uh briefly the only thing
[00:05:26] is uh I I was watching I was like I
[00:05:28] should probably add background music to

[00:05:34] um this is what the thumbnail is in case
[00:05:37] you're

[00:10:27] chat I think think I'm going to Chuck it
[00:10:29] on the second Channel because okay I
[00:10:32] like it but there's parts of it where
[00:10:34] like I cringe watching it it might just
[00:10:36] be because I cringe watching myself in
[00:10:39] those instances but like I can't watch
[00:10:41] it sometimes it's not like I I so and I
[00:10:45] only upload my favorite videos like I'm
[00:10:46] not going to upload something just
[00:10:47] upload
[00:10:48] something I always cringe watching you
[00:10:57] um speaking of which just like dude like
[00:11:00] but like we spend a lot of time on our
[00:11:02] videos like at to the point where like I
[00:11:04] see everyone make the videos I want to
[00:11:05] make but then it's like I started on it
[00:11:07] like a month ago but because it takes so
[00:11:09] long if I upload it it's going to look
[00:11:10] like it's like similar like I saw slice
[00:11:12] I love slice by the way big shout out
[00:11:14] but I saw slice upload like the I spent
[00:11:16] resin on nette and I like I recorded
[00:11:18] that like a month ago it's just not done
[00:11:20] yet but I I figured out a way to make my
[00:11:23] thumbnail and title like completely
[00:11:24] different cuz I was like well actually
[00:11:26] this is my editor who thought of it so
[00:11:27] Sam if you're watching this on but he
[00:11:29] was like yo just make it I spent a month
[00:11:32] farming from net which is true and then
[00:11:33] boom it's like more clickbait anyways so
[00:11:35] w but uh not the leak a video idea but
[00:11:38] he agreed so I guess I could say that it
[00:11:40] might be happening I DM slice I was like
[00:11:42] yo first of all can we kiss I didn't say
[00:11:44] that but then I was like listen I want
[00:11:47] to make a strong Box video in emblem
[00:11:49] where I'm smart and responsible and you
[00:11:51] make strong box videos in emblem
[00:11:53] sometimes so what if at one point right
[00:11:56] soon we both do emem strong box but we
[00:12:00] we we we we challenge each other to like
[00:12:02] 500 artifacts and then whoever gets the
[00:12:03] best build wins and then the loser has
[00:12:05] to do something has to [ __ ] I will

[00:18:59] just saying I'm just saying I was dude I
[00:19:02] saw okay I saw I keep seeing do you know
[00:19:05] what the good part about Elon Runing
[00:19:06] Twitter is now my for you page is [ __ ]
[00:19:09] so I see a bunch of dumb [ __ ] which
[00:19:11] means I get to make fun of it and be
[00:19:13] funny I saw someone being like Oh if you
[00:19:17] okay should I expose it uh no I won't
[00:19:20] but I saw someone being like Oh if you
[00:19:22] play these characters don't interact
[00:19:24] with me and it was just like every anemo
[00:19:25] character and it's
[00:19:27] like what is wrong with you so I was
[00:19:29] like I think it would be funny if I just
[00:19:32] imitated it like without like being mean
[00:19:34] to them just imitating it and then
[00:19:35] posting every single character but then
[00:19:37] I wasn't going to do this initially but
[00:19:38] then when I did it I was like okay I
[00:19:40] can't slander kakomi Nation though so I
[00:19:41] crossed out kakomi so everyone yeah this
[00:19:44] is every charact I think Net's not here
[00:19:45] cuz he's new but this is every character
[00:19:47] except kookomi I was like you know what

[00:19:50] guys you guys can interact that's
[00:19:52] fine Shia okay this is a joke post but

[00:20:11] ratio plus wait chat if you chat chat
[00:20:14] arinara son or meloine daughter no if

[00:20:19] you kick a meloine or deep fry arinara
[00:20:22] you have to do one what would you do I
[00:20:24] personally think net would kill me if I
[00:20:28] kicked an um a meloine but if I def
[00:20:32] arara then the forest remembers so
[00:20:34] personally I think I would defy arara
[00:20:35] and then eat cabbage but I think kicking
[00:20:38] a meloine is not as bad as like killing
[00:20:39] an arara so maybe they'd understand it
[00:20:42] depends on the
[00:20:44] context anemo boyman are red flags

[00:35:41] was there there are two realities before
[00:35:43] you open the box one reality where the
[00:35:45] cat's alive one reality where the cat's
[00:35:47] dead that's why they call it Z's cat
[00:35:49] it's like Z's artifact you enter
[00:35:51] Vermillion you spend 40 resin you don't
[00:35:54] claim the artifact piece but you see a
[00:35:56] goblet there is one world where it's an
[00:35:58] anemo goblet one world where it's not
[00:35:59] you live in both in the same time Doctor
[00:36:02] Strange sees both of
[00:36:04] them cable what okay I don't know why I
[00:36:10] guess cable I think I saw it in chat
[00:36:11] like an hour ago probably someone was
[00:36:13] cheating why the [ __ ] does cable make
[00:36:15] sense I don't even know why I guess that
[00:36:18] wait let me not look anymore let me not
[00:36:19] look at chat anymore I closed it let me
[00:36:21] not look I changed my chat to to a
[00:36:23] random tab so I can't see you guys I'm
[00:36:25] not I have to get the last one of my
[00:36:27] cable is like it's either cables that
[00:36:29] connect to something or cable like like
[00:36:30] TV cable so it's probably not TV though
[00:36:34] or it could be like inside TV that
[00:36:35] doesn't even make sense cable you
[00:36:38] plug ooh wait is it just TV no
[00:36:43] television computer
[00:36:45] electronic I sound like such a boomer
[00:36:48] wait plug is good though plug you plug

[00:37:07] doing plug was good plug was a good gu
[00:37:09] so good
[00:37:11] job cable label stop

[00:37:19] thinking before I type
[00:37:24] cable I want to say like Gamecube or
[00:37:26] some [ __ ] like it's not that there's no
[00:37:28] way it's that cable is one it's two
[00:37:30] which means it's like literally the
[00:37:31] closest word or second closest so Tech
[00:37:34] it has to be something that's like
[00:37:35] literally related to cable so it's like
[00:37:38] wire I am like if Albert Einstein was
[00:37:41] still alive I he would literally have to
[00:37:45] seek employment from me cuz if I was if
[00:37:48] we were both alive he would be

[00:38:40] I mean Zeals does wait Ka I has it
[00:38:42] enabled all
[00:38:48] whatever yeah anyways I think it's time
[00:38:50] we play oh actually
[00:38:55] um
[00:38:58] I we okay we have to pick I don't know
[00:39:02] if I'll do it now or later but we are
[00:39:04] going to pick one of your guys' accounts
[00:39:07] to review three now I'm going to do the
[00:39:10] account review next genin stream
[00:39:12] probably but we have to pick it today I
[00:39:14] was going to pick it off stream and then
[00:39:15] do the reviews on
[00:39:17] stream like today but then I but I
[00:39:20] looked at one account and I actually
[00:39:21] started laughing and I was like this is
[00:39:23] wasted content if I don't stream it so
[00:39:25] we're going to look through them
[00:39:26] together uh not to make fun of the
[00:39:27] account or anything obviously we're
[00:39:29] going to help them it's going to be cool
[00:39:30] it's not going to be like bullying but
[00:39:32] it was just funny okay I don't remember
[00:39:33] why it was just funny uh clout one of
[00:39:36] our mods yes I think other mods helped
[00:39:37] too but uh uh did sort through the 300's
[00:39:40] accounts your title is misspelled okay
[00:39:42] I'm going to ban you for knowing how to
[00:39:44] spell uh you shouldn't be in Gin chat
[00:39:46] however I will change it it was only a
[00:39:48] 10-minute timeout okay how do you spell
[00:39:50] choose is there two o's how do you wait
[00:39:53] no oh that was like chosing I guess how
[00:39:55] do you I don't know how to a chew is
[00:39:57] this is this how you spell
[00:39:59] it okay my bad
[00:40:05] whatever he went to law school by the
[00:40:07] way dude you dude I went in French
[00:40:11] you're going to make fun of a French
[00:40:12] speaking studier so you're going to make
[00:40:15] fun of me for my second language dude I
[00:40:17] saw also okay also cuz I forgot to talk
[00:40:19] about this tweet cuz I was funny okay
[00:40:21] there was someone who okay this wasn't
[00:40:23] even a bad point I just thought that way
[00:40:24] it was funny someone was like oh the
[00:40:26] Jong Lee is not actually a dragon people
[00:40:29] this such a big misconception and the
[00:40:30] way they worded it was like stupid and
[00:40:32] then some BL like oh it's not their
[00:40:34] first language it's like listen the
[00:40:36] point is probably true I get it he's an
[00:40:38] archon with a dragon form it's not the
[00:40:40] same as just someone who's just always a
[00:40:41] dragon whatever but it's like dude dude
[00:40:45] how is it a misconception if I was
[00:40:47] streaming and I turned into a [ __ ]
[00:40:49] Axel for 10 minutes and then back to a
[00:40:51] human there would be people be like oh
[00:40:53] my God that's such a cool Axel or like
[00:40:55] they would draw that act it's not a Mis
[00:40:58] maybe it is I mean the point was fair I
[00:40:59] just thought it was funny so I I copy
[00:41:01] pasted it but then put Shia is cute and
[00:41:03] then I post posted the Shia plushy so
[00:41:08] yeah that's like saying volin is okay
[00:41:10] listen I don't know enough about the
[00:41:12] like lore and the lore theories to get
[00:41:15] into it I don't want to pick a side
[00:41:17] because why would I so I'm just going to
[00:41:19] laugh at the way it was presented not in
[00:41:21] a disrespectful manner I just think it
[00:41:23] was [ __ ] a [ __ ] just funny and
[00:41:25] weird tweet so we're going to laugh at
[00:41:27] it together and then we're going to move
[00:41:28] on that it just is what it
[00:41:36] is also I saw so I heard about this
[00:41:40] before releasing by devette guide but I
[00:41:41] thought it was a meme it is a meme but
[00:41:44] like more people are playing it I think
[00:41:45] it's like a placeholder till finina
[00:41:47] comes out what does finina do I don't
[00:41:48] [ __ ] know but she's a Hydra archon so
[00:41:50] she'll probably be good with everyone
[00:41:52] and this team is called uh child in jail
[00:41:55] the child prison comp I didn't name it I
[00:41:57] just saw someone call it that I think
[00:41:59] it's [ __ ] funny which is where you
[00:42:00] have net with Fel and kazwa a really
[00:42:03] good team comp already and then your
[00:42:04] last thought is you just Chuck child in
[00:42:06] prison so you literally take tartaglia
[00:42:08] you put him here right Ed Shar in your
[00:42:09] team you might be like why you get hydro
[00:42:11] resonance 25% HP and a free Talent level
[00:42:14] so you literally get level well 10 plus
[00:42:17] one here it would be level 11 talent for
[00:42:19] free and you never swap into him he's
[00:42:21] just in jail that's why he's called in
[00:42:22] jail cuz you just you never swap into
[00:42:25] him
[00:42:27] look boom and it actually works it's not
[00:42:31] like okay I don't recommend it but
[00:42:34] that's not funny I mean it's literally a
[00:42:35] team cuz you get hydro resonance and you
[00:42:39] get uh to level not even for burst I
[00:42:41] mean you probably can like you could
[00:42:43] probably like burst there's probably
[00:42:45] [ __ ] you can do but like you don't even
[00:42:46] have to swap into him it's just like
[00:42:48] yeah it's pretty funny fav plus
[00:42:52] instructor
[00:42:55] okay I
[00:43:04] don't okay if you guys are unironically
[00:43:08] defending child on fav instructor I'm
[00:43:10] not going to fight you in fact I can see
[00:43:12] why but if you guys do that then you
[00:43:15] also have to admit no no no no no I'm
[00:43:17] serious right now you also have to admit
[00:43:19] that in this core sha or scar Moosh team
[00:43:22] right here you have to admit that Hut on
[00:43:25] fav and uh tenacity of the MTH would be
[00:43:28] or like no blast or some sh would be a
[00:43:30] good last slot because you can use her
[00:43:32] passive Talent here for 12% crit rate on
[00:43:35] top of the Pyro resonance that you're
[00:43:37] getting acknowledging Hut as the best
[00:43:40] support her artifacts that doesn't
[00:43:42] matter here actually but you would go
[00:43:43] fav and then um fav and then py
[00:43:47] resonance
[00:43:55] true
[00:43:56] no forget it tenacity good cuz blood
[00:44:00] Blossom okay but then what is farzon on
[00:44:02] I guess like oh Verdes and vener and
[00:44:05] then
[00:44:07] you're you swirl pyro [ __ ]
[00:44:10] it wait how often does blood Blossom do
[00:44:12] [ __ ] I actually don't know this aboutut
[00:44:15] let me read
[00:44:16] it trag blood Blossom yeah you have to
[00:44:19] do one CA before you swap
[00:44:22] each six months where does say the CD do
[00:44:26] I have to count it
[00:44:28] myself oh every 4 seconds wait that's
[00:44:31] actually fine every four and it lasts
[00:44:34] eight ah yeah I mean better than
[00:44:41] nothing does plus Mona need VY or can
[00:44:44] Kaz work finea and Mona need veny or
[00:44:47] does Kaz work
[00:44:49] fine no venty is better vent is usually
[00:44:52] better uh sorry did I just say venty
[00:44:54] sorry Kazo is better venty is is only
[00:44:56] better if you can like if all the
[00:44:58] enemies are turbo displaceable by with
[00:45:00] ventti but that usually doesn't happen
[00:45:02] so I usually recommend Kazo
[00:45:04] there that team doesn't need
[00:45:08] venti the team that needs like quote
[00:45:10] unquote needs venty is the G one cuz the
[00:45:12] the point of that team is well you can
[00:45:13] still use wazo but the point is uh G
[00:45:17] burst it's like quadratic and it like
[00:45:19] it'll summon on all the enemies and then
[00:45:20] you [ __ ] shove them together with
[00:45:22] veny and you freeze them all with Mona
[00:45:24] and then it's like
[00:45:27] yeah anyways I think we picked the
[00:45:29] account we're going to
[00:45:31] review uh before we get into the game
[00:45:33] let's get right into the new wait
[00:45:35] actually I have to find these hiding
[00:45:36] kids cuz I think this achievement this
[00:45:38] uh commission gives you an achievement
[00:45:40] and I am now an achievement Arnold so
[00:45:42] first of all we found
[00:45:46] verit can you explain how snapshotting
[00:45:48] Works listen uh I have seen your name
[00:45:50] too many times in my chat which means
[00:45:51] you are saying that for me to uh make up
[00:45:54] an analogy and I am not going to do that
[00:45:56] to someone who isn't being genuine if
[00:45:58] you're an honest new chatter I would
[00:46:00] explain it to you but I can I already
[00:46:02] can tell where you're your your your
[00:46:04] your your interests are
[00:46:07] at wait is this not the kid I'm looking
[00:46:11] for who the [ __ ] is
[00:46:13] RL oh it is it is okay it is it is I
[00:46:16] thought it was just a random
[00:46:23] kid what is front loaded backloaded
[00:46:25] damage okay front loaded damage is
[00:46:27] loaded in the front back loaded damage
[00:46:29] is loaded in the
[00:46:30] back think of like Kim okay never mind
[00:46:34] dude think of no no no no real talk
[00:46:35] though okay who's like a front loaded
[00:46:37] character think of like think of like
[00:46:39] think of like um
[00:46:45] okay child no no I'm not talking about
[00:46:48] like damage wise I'm like you're saying
[00:46:51] child's front loaded cuz you can burst
[00:46:52] right I'm not talking about that I'm
[00:46:54] saying front loaded like visually
[00:46:56] like like alham right Alam you look at
[00:46:58] him from the front there's like more
[00:47:00] than from the back but then like cave in
[00:47:03] his trailer there is a moment where he
[00:47:05] was
[00:47:06] backloaded
[00:47:11] whatever front loaded damage is like you
[00:47:14] do a big burst of damage and
[00:47:16] then most it's either most or a big part
[00:47:19] of damage can be at the start of your
[00:47:20] rotation backloaded is at the end like
[00:47:22] YULA YULA is like doesn't really well
[00:47:25] she her no attacks do damage but it's
[00:47:27] like most of her damage at least like
[00:47:28] 50% will come from the big hit at the
[00:47:30] end which mean and usually backload
[00:47:32] damage is worse than front loed because
[00:47:34] let's say it takes you for most like
[00:47:36] let's say your character is just loaded
[00:47:38] not back loaded not front loaded it's
[00:47:39] just consistent DPS the whole time let's
[00:47:41] say it'll take you like like 25 seconds
[00:47:44] to kill whereas let's say let's say it
[00:47:46] takes you like 1.5 rotations for them
[00:47:49] it'll be exactly the 1.5 for another
[00:47:51] character who's backloaded you would
[00:47:53] need two full rotations because you
[00:47:54] don't get the 05 till the end
[00:47:57] that that was a bad explanation but you
[00:47:58] get my point my 48
[00:48:01] 665 M5
[00:48:06] 75,6 I'm not reviewing your ar48 Hut
[00:48:10] dude before I got home
[00:48:11] today cuz we were [ __ ] driving back
[00:48:14] before we got home we literally the dude
[00:48:15] we got [ __ ] pulled over cuz I don't
[00:48:17] know what the [ __ ] happened I think we
[00:48:19] like ran a red light or something
[00:48:20] literally okay I [ __ ] you not the
[00:48:22] officer was like wait a second are you

[00:48:36] allot buing citizen I'm actually wanted
[00:48:38] in seven different
[00:48:43] states
[00:48:45] anyways I'm not I'm not that was a joke
[00:48:47] for legal reasons that was a
[00:48:50] joke uh we finished our uh commissions
[00:48:53] these don't give achievements right yeah
[00:48:54] they don't oh also I was doing ka's uh
[00:48:57] story Quest off stream unironically I
[00:48:59] was like [ __ ] it I need to get these
[00:49:01] achievements some someday so I was
[00:49:02] literally [ __ ] I was lit [ __ ]
[00:49:04] doing this oh we got one ending but I
[00:49:06] have to do all the others so I kind of
[00:49:08] don't want to but
[00:49:20] whatever wait how do I what am I doing
[00:49:22] what am I doing press F1 claim this then
[00:49:25] Escape Escape open the map why do you
[00:49:28] want achievements I just want a thousand
[00:49:30] I want to hit a thousand I think I
[00:49:32] should I'll hide them span thanks for 10
[00:49:35] months uh let me teleport to The Domain
[00:49:37] we're going to do but before we do the
[00:49:39] domain let's pick an account that we're
[00:49:41] going to review I think uh there were
[00:49:43] over 30 like 30 or 50 submissions in my
[00:49:47] Discord I Mark Discord of cursed
[00:49:49] accounts we're going to review now we're
[00:49:50] going to I'm going to review this next
[00:49:52] stream but today we're going to pick the
[00:49:53] account together you guys can vote oh
[00:49:55] this this account looks fun oh this
[00:49:57] account looks [ __ ] whatever
[00:50:00] right and then next stream we're going
[00:50:03] to review it next stream and fix it
[00:50:07] we're not just going to review the
[00:50:08] account we're going to spend their resin
[00:50:09] that's why I wanted the person that I'm
[00:50:11] reviewing to have a lot of fragile resin
[00:50:12] so we can spend resin invest in their
[00:50:14] characters make the account better clear
[00:50:16] the abyss and transform it that is the
[00:50:18] plan now whale account review will be
[00:50:20] next the only problem is dude I didn't
[00:50:23] upload a whale account like all the
[00:50:24] whale count reviews I upload well people
[00:50:25] like them and then I just haven't
[00:50:27] uploaded them in Forever cuz I've just
[00:50:28] been in like editing jail and it's like
[00:50:31] now I I see them like everyone in their
[00:50:33] mom's uploading them so I kind of don't
[00:50:34] want to do it but I probably still
[00:50:36] should so we'll do that next
[00:50:39] um C2 or weapon C1 and
[00:50:46] weapon
[00:50:49] anyways so what we're going to do now
[00:50:52] I'm going to do a St stream for Jing yes
[00:50:54] I should
[00:50:55] what we're going to do now is look at
[00:50:57] the accounts that we got sent there's a
[00:50:59] lot um there's a lot now the thing is
[00:51:03] there were over 350 that got sent clout
[00:51:06] or some of my mods on Discord looked
[00:51:08] through them and pinned the ones that
[00:51:10] were interesting I also found a few
[00:51:11] Myself by a few I mean like two uh there
[00:51:14] now the thing is a lot of people
[00:51:16] submitted if you don't see your account
[00:51:18] here it's okay thanks for submitting
[00:51:20] anyways we're only going to pick like
[00:51:21] one or two so there's a lot of like good
[00:51:24] accounts that we can't review cuz we're
[00:51:25] only going to do one or two now the
[00:51:27] problem is I appreciate everyone that
[00:51:29] submitted what what I noticed was okay
[00:51:31] this is supposed to be cursed accounts
[00:51:32] that we're fixing people that are like
[00:51:33] dude I'm like AR [ __ ] whatever I
[00:51:35] can't clear the abyss what's wrong with
[00:51:36] me okay it's not just new accounts cuz I
[00:51:39] saw a lot of people that submit like a
[00:51:41] ar30 account and I'm like bro I'm not
[00:51:43] just going to be like haha you're new
[00:51:45] that's not the point okay we're not
[00:51:46] opening a ar45 account and be like wow
[00:51:48] you're new that's not the point okay
[00:51:50] we're taking accounts that need help
[00:51:52] that need fixing that is the goal that
[00:51:54] is what we're looking for they could be
[00:51:55] freet to play they could be whale they
[00:51:56] could be a mixture of both it whatever
[00:52:00] it is it is I'm also going to change
[00:52:02] playlists uh we're going to play [ __ ]
[00:52:06] um [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't know just play
[00:52:09] this
[00:52:11] yeah ar30 just needs to play the game
[00:52:13] yeah
[00:52:14] exactly so yeah we're going to look
[00:52:16] through the ones we have there's also a
[00:52:18] lot more so if these aren't good we can
[00:52:20] go through the other ones as well is the
[00:52:22] reward is real bro at Zio what does that
[00:52:25] mean what what does is the reward is
[00:52:27] real mean I'm sorry no disrespect
[00:52:36] what okay anyways so we're going to look
[00:52:38] through them one by one I didn't
[00:52:40] actually like vet these I'm going to
[00:52:41] assume that my mods went through the in
[00:52:43] links that they like pinned so that
[00:52:45] there's no random like [ __ ] but we're
[00:52:47] just going to assume that's true okay so
[00:52:49] are the drops what are the drop oh the
[00:52:51] drops end no there should be still drops
[00:52:53] no if there's no pop-up then I scam yeah

[00:55:21] yolan your ER is extremely low but you
[00:55:23] have C1 depends on what team you're
[00:55:26] running um because I know you can't
[00:55:29] clear floor 12 I'm going to assume that
[00:55:32] you're not managing your energy enough
[00:55:33] so I'm going to say please go in ER
[00:55:35] Sands um
[00:55:38] but maybe it's okay maybe you're playing
[00:55:41] something where like hey I have double
[00:55:42] hydro and I have fa weapons maybe but
[00:55:46] yeah uh wandering everstar Nita uh you
[00:55:49] have like 1km which is uh yeah I mean
[00:55:54] yeah cookie okay this okay yo this is
[00:55:56] like lowkey not even cursed wait what
[00:56:00] okay do you not use strangling there's
[00:56:02] no [ __ ] way you use a character who
[00:56:04] has 60 crit rates 60 crit damage look no
[00:56:07] no be for real right now there's no way
[00:56:09] there's just no way there's just no way
[00:56:10] that's happening there's just no
[00:56:14] way maybe you don't use her it is what
[00:56:17] it is uh your bet doesn't exist for some
[00:56:23] reason
[00:56:25] okay we'll we'll come back to this
[00:56:27] account we'll come back to it okay
[00:56:28] that's one second one uh is an
[00:56:31] enko what the [ __ ] is
[00:56:34] this oh wait you're only ar51 though
[00:56:37] wait is that too low I
[00:56:39] mean what was this one or was this one's
[00:56:42] AR can I see or does it
[00:56:46] show I don't know
[00:56:49] but ar51 is low like at that
[00:56:53] point okay
[00:56:56] listen listen I excuse new players play
[00:56:59] the game learn the game no no no rush
[00:57:02] but if you pull for Hut and you pull for
[00:57:04] C1 please don't put her on hird please
[00:57:08] you could pick a random weapon and it's
[00:57:10] probably better than halberd please if
[00:57:12] you're going to use a three star use
[00:57:14] white tassel white tassel's free white
[00:57:16] tassel's
[00:57:21] free um this is surprisingly good for
[00:57:24] ar5 though this is actually fine you
[00:57:26] just probably need to play more this one
[00:57:29] yeah I mean yeah okay what's this one
[00:57:31] curse that count for ox this guy's
[00:57:34] French Super Carry till
[00:57:39] his okay anyways uh what the [ __ ] is
[00:57:42] wait is espadon French what the [ __ ] is
[00:57:45] that
[00:57:53] espadon
[00:58:03] wait dude these are low AR okay these
[00:58:05] are 55 plus what about this one I can't
[00:58:07] see this one's level 90 okay we might
[00:58:09] have to go to the end ones I don't want
[00:58:11] to do like an ar50 I think I mean ar50
[00:58:14] is like yeah cuz your max level's um I
[00:58:17] mean you could still Level 90 your
[00:58:18] weapons at 50 but 55 feels like you're
[00:58:21] like trying more like 55 feels like if
[00:58:23] you like if you can't C the best at 50
[00:58:25] like who cares like it's like it's fine
[00:58:27] but like if higher than 55 it's like you
[00:58:29] might need help well I mean it's still
[00:58:31] fine if you can't but you get my point
[00:58:33] although this account
[00:58:36] is do 55 minimum yeah I could I mean
[00:58:38] there's so many accounts like it's okay
[00:58:40] if we go back and look through them but
[00:58:42] okay let's look through the ones I have
[00:58:43] open Rohan har of Don King actually
[00:58:47] really good if you're playing wrong Le
[00:58:49] why do you have Berserker you have tiny
[00:58:53] miracle
[00:58:58] okay T
[00:59:00] Berserker you know what's funny I was
[00:59:03] going to I'm giving you the benefit of
[00:59:04] the doubt that you're playing like
[00:59:05] Harbinger with a shield but looking at
[00:59:07] your artifacts there is a 0% chance
[00:59:10] you're using Harbinger in a team that
[00:59:11] actually wants Harbinger that is my
[00:59:15] guess iron sting
[00:59:21] Kaza maybe you don't have five it's fine
[00:59:24] but someone said HP Sands where oh my
[00:59:27] God you have 1,00 attack I'm pretty sure
[00:59:30] my like BYU has
[00:59:32] more what is my dude my Nita has as much
[00:59:36] attack as your
[00:59:37] kaching all good I mean okay to be fair
[00:59:41] kajin could use em Sands and if you do
[00:59:43] then it's okay to have low attack but
[00:59:46] yeah uh okay let's look at y yon
[00:59:53] um
[00:59:55] how much fragile resin does this person
[00:59:57] have let me see let me see if this is
[00:59:58] actually fixable let me see this might
[00:59:59] actually be
[01:00:06] fixable wait what U IDE is this starts
[01:00:08] with
[01:00:13] eight I'm trying to find their account
[01:00:15] Che give me a
[01:00:16] second
[01:00:23] um
[01:00:26] I find it so 1 2 3 4 5 six the
[01:00:29] count trying to find their message oh
[01:00:32] there is they have 19 fragiles they Peak
[01:00:36] 23 stars in The
[01:00:40] Abyss level six oh why okay okay okay
[01:00:44] okay okay okay okay okay okay you're a z
[01:00:46] Vier which means you have access to Z
[01:00:49] videos guides you can you kingm you
[01:00:51] could you have access to information why
[01:00:52] is your why is your Yan still higher
[01:00:55] level than her burst you have why I just
[01:00:58] want to know I just want to know no I'm
[01:00:59] not accusing you of anything I just want
[01:01:00] to know it's just a genuine question why
[01:01:04] B look at Kaz
[01:01:08] set okay yo a okay I don't all right we
[01:01:13] have uh oh this is good level 40
[01:01:18] though I take back what I said this
[01:01:19] isn't good Hut you have that's actually
[01:01:22] a good weapon that's actually a good
[01:01:24] weapon uh
[01:01:26] um oh my God Lions Roar
[01:01:30] Bennett your Bennett
[01:01:34] has please give Bennett please give him
[01:01:37] ER please I beg please he doesn't want
[01:01:40] an attack sance he doesn't he doesn't
[01:01:44] want an attack s attack does not
[01:01:46] increase your Bennett's buff okay base
[01:01:48] attack does you want a base attack
[01:01:51] weapon you don't want an attack % on
[01:01:55] your
[01:01:57] artifacts
[01:02:00] um this
[01:02:02] is your Harp's level 20 why are your
[01:02:05] weapons level 20 why why is you don't
[01:02:08] have a single level 90 okay you're only
[01:02:10] level 90 weapon is harbinger of
[01:02:14] dawn which surprisingly enough is
[01:02:23] based yeah that's on he's on an attack
[01:02:26] sanss and Goblin okay also to anyone
[01:02:30] watching and to maybe this person if
[01:02:31] you're watching please understand that
[01:02:35] never should you go okay never unless
[01:02:39] it's like a support set should you go
[01:02:40] artifact set over main stats sub stats
[01:02:44] maybe even then sub stats are usually
[01:02:46] better but maybe but main stats you no
[01:02:49] you're not going and attack Sans on a
[01:02:51] different set or on the right set [ __ ]
[01:02:53] that
[01:02:56] how's kaching always going to be over
[01:02:57] 90% yeah exactly like it depends I'm
[01:02:59] giving them the benefit of a doubt that
[01:03:01] they're playing aggravate kaching with
[01:03:02] either Kirara or Jang Lee or maybe baiju
[01:03:06] but baiju's Shield is paper thin so it
[01:03:08] doesn't really work that's like my
[01:03:10] assumption but it's probably not it's
[01:03:12] probably not happening um okay we might
[01:03:15] go back to this account this one is
[01:03:16] funny aggravate with 40 em yeah dude
[01:03:19] they're on in HP Sands i i i i there's
[01:03:22] only so much doubt that I can benefit
[01:03:24] give them that doesn't even make sense
[01:03:25] Seb what up
[01:03:27] SE wait I saw this
[01:03:31] one it's a ulate in the rys
[01:03:36] 4 okay yo no no no disrespect yo I'm not
[01:03:40] yo I don't Abyss shame okay I'm just
[01:03:43] saying it's
[01:03:45] funny this is actually a pretty good Ula
[01:03:48] it's
[01:03:49] just okay this isn't a bad Ula you just
[01:03:53] maybe want some crit rate maybe want
[01:03:54] some ER but your attack's really good
[01:03:56] and your crit damage is really good
[01:04:01] so um
[01:04:03] yeah broke out col and
[01:04:06] dipped okay diona uh fa warbo four bless
[01:04:10] actually good even if you're down has
[01:04:12] like no stats as long as well you have
[01:04:14] 10 crit rate so you're not proing your
[01:04:15] R1 your R1 fav is probably proing once
[01:04:18] every 17 years uh even if daa's e hits
[01:04:21] multiple times
[01:04:23] Kookie

[01:13:36] heart I can clear 9 through 11
[01:13:39] fine uh 36 start a year and a half ago
[01:13:42] but haven't been able to since because I
[01:13:44] don't attempt it anymore because it got
[01:13:45] harder and harder that is understandable
[01:13:47] oh yeah there's
[01:13:49] c6i yeah chat stop spamming uids I I had
[01:13:51] a for on Discord they only have 14
[01:13:53] fragiles which isn't that many so I
[01:13:55] don't know how much we could
[01:13:56] realistically I mean they said
[01:13:59] struggling with a C6 and a C2
[01:14:02] Lenny please don't level my Alam we have
[01:14:06] mega
[01:14:07] beef what the [ __ ] did Alam do what did
[01:14:11] Alam do why are you on black Cliff
[01:14:22] Neu okay let's look at your account so
[01:14:25] this is a C6 Yi that's struggling with
[01:14:28] Abyss that's actually good content
[01:14:29] you're on two reminescence two
[01:14:30] thundering Fury 76 to10 really good crit
[01:14:34] ratio they watch your guides Bozo okay
[01:14:38] look what does listen why listen in my
[01:14:42] guides I sayem yaim Miko is better now
[01:14:44] with aggravate and stuff so you can't
[01:14:47] blame me for someone not clearing this
[01:14:49] is a Triple Crown C6 r5i unironically
[01:14:53] genuinely good let's look at the other
[01:14:55] characters to see if this is cursed or
[01:14:56] if it's just skill issue uh freeze
[01:15:00] gone with a unfathomable am of crit
[01:15:03] damage however literally like zero
[01:15:06] attack but it's melt it's no it's not
[01:15:07] melt you don't want em it's freeze um I
[01:15:11] mean this is pretty good
[01:15:14] though 27 crit rate on yeah but you get
[01:15:17] 40 from blizzard and then you get uh 15
[01:15:19] from crowd residence and you get 20 from
[01:15:22] her burst right
[01:15:24] so you get like a lot of crit or is it
[01:15:26] 15 from her burst I always forget no
[01:15:28] King's 15 so G has to be
[01:15:30] 20 so it's fine this is fine cuz I know
[01:15:33] King's 15 so it has to be 24 charge
[01:15:36] attack yeah but like I mean I guess if
[01:15:38] you're playing Mona venti your burst is
[01:15:40] like super important but like yeah you
[01:15:42] get my point I wouldn't
[01:15:45] overcap like I think it's okay if your
[01:15:47] burst has 80 crit
[01:15:50] rate but I guess it depends some
[01:15:52] sometimes
[01:15:55] like anyways Kaza 927 em 150 er uh
[01:16:01] usually that's fine but in a g team you
[01:16:03] might want more however uh
[01:16:06] okay uh this is fine your Linny is um
[01:16:10] somehow you have Aqua simulakra but no
[01:16:12] crit damage how is that even
[01:16:15] possible wait this actually a lot of
[01:16:17] crit sub stats am I just out of touch oh
[01:16:19] that's Amos okay that's Amos I was like
[01:16:22] how okay that's Amos that explains a lot
[01:16:25] that explains a lot uh what's on your
[01:16:27] ganu Aqua okay um
[01:16:31] please please throw your ganu into a
[01:16:34] blender give your Amos to Linny and you
[01:16:36] will clear much faster no disrespect to
[01:16:38] ganu it's just that your Mona isn't
[01:16:41] geared you're probably playing freeze G
[01:16:43] and you're not able to [ __ ] group
[01:16:45] enemies or or even freeze the enemies in
[01:16:47] the abyss although I think this Abyss
[01:16:50] you can free stuff but yeah probably
[01:16:53] would want to play Linny I would play
[01:16:54] Linny and Y Miko here as my two teams if
[01:16:57] I were you um no disrespect to G
[01:17:00] you I N star B with G patch okay I'm not
[01:17:04] saying you can't but it doesn't look
[01:17:06] like they have
[01:17:07] [Music]
[01:17:08] the oh let's look at the nilu so yilu
[01:17:11] has
[01:17:22] 20
[01:17:24] that's a
[01:17:25] crit your yaa is
[01:17:31] good your sing trol at least has enough
[01:17:33] ER I mean this is like too much ER but
[01:17:36] whatever at least you can this is like
[01:17:38] level one srol at least you can [ __ ]
[01:17:39] proc Hydro
[01:17:42] whatever juven has no em but somehow no
[01:17:46] crit either so I don't know what your
[01:17:47] sub you have a HP S don't even talk to
[01:17:50] me catch Ryden this is you have two
[01:17:55] why did you I mean this is actually not
[01:17:56] that bad this is fine this is fine y we
[01:18:00] catches R1 Go Fish okay listen I said I
[01:18:03] would fix cursed accounts I'm not going
[01:18:05] to fish for you if you [ __ ] okay if
[01:18:08] you think I'm going to fish for you you
[01:18:11] you're in the wrong stream brother
[01:18:13] you're in the wrong stream if you think
[01:18:15] I'm going to log in and start
[01:18:18] fishing I am not going to
[01:18:21] fish this is a good kokomi MTH throwing
[01:18:25] Tails um yeah that works your ER is
[01:18:28] really low some teams don't need burst
[01:18:31] um if you're playing like melt like
[01:18:33] freeze G or something you probably would
[01:18:34] want to burst but whatever Hut Dragon B
[01:18:39] that's good uh somehow 50 crit
[01:18:44] rate with a crit rate
[01:18:47] circlet your normal attacks are level
[01:18:51] three you also have two
[01:18:58] reminescence maybe you just yeah maybe
[01:19:00] you just pulled to tow maybe just I'll
[01:19:01] give you yeah yeah maybe you just pulled
[01:19:03] them
[01:19:05] Bennett that's enough that's actually
[01:19:07] good Bennett I like this Bennett I like
[01:19:08] this
[01:19:09] Bennett um okay I mean this account is
[01:19:13] I'm just worried that it's so this
[01:19:14] account is definitely doable the only
[01:19:16] thing is I'm worried that it might not
[01:19:18] be I don't know if this is cursed or if
[01:19:20] it's just a skill issue is what I'm
[01:19:22] trying to determine
[01:19:25] uh but it is pixable so we'll leave this
[01:19:34] open skill isue I think cloud you're the
[01:19:37] one that pinned it I'm sorry no no I
[01:19:39] picked this one never mind I just flamed
[01:19:40] one of my mods for no reason I am so
[01:19:42] sorry I am so sorry I'm
[01:19:46] sorry I just flamed you for no reason I
[01:19:49] just made a mistake and then blamed
[01:19:51] you wait let me look at some of these
[01:19:55] uh uid reviews what is this
[01:20:08] one they have 666 achievements and their
[01:20:10] name is Barbara Stan 598 is this Albert
[01:20:13] from the [ __ ] Quest did we find
[01:20:16] Albert mods can we ban
[01:20:21] Albert
[01:20:29] yo why are you on a crit rate
[01:20:36] ciret also how do you have the best
[01:20:40] feather I've ever seen and then the most
[01:20:42] like atrocious
[01:20:46] flower also why would you oh I guess you
[01:20:49] need MTH wait who's even using MTH
[01:20:52] you're on mppa
[01:20:57] MAR this is fine Amino would be better
[01:21:00] if you have literally no energy recharge
[01:21:01] though black Liv is okay if you have
[01:21:03] enough ER but you have literally zero or
[01:21:10] 11 R5
[01:21:14] mappa sorry that was weird
[01:21:20] uh please level your ficial she's level

[01:21:31] please level your official Barbara
[01:21:34] though
[01:21:38] Shish we could actually play Barbara

[01:21:44] could do bar we have to level your
[01:21:45] official but we could do Barbara
[01:21:48] official okay the problem is I kind of
[01:21:50] just took the most recent account that's
[01:21:52] what I just p up but they didn't really
[01:21:54] submit that much
[01:21:55] information

[01:22:05] go yeah they didn't really submit that
[01:22:07] much
[01:22:12] information they said they have 21
[01:22:15] fragile which is probably
[01:22:20] enough and then their only message was
[01:22:22] hi mods aha love you mua also I play
[01:22:30] Barbara I mean I think it's do
[01:22:34] dude what would we even play though cuz

[01:29:09] I feel bad for you farming Vermilion
[01:29:11] please stop please get some help you
[01:29:13] don't want to farm Vermilion however at
[01:29:16] this point you already have three pieces
[01:29:18] so you might as well get the fourth keep
[01:29:20] farming Vermillion Chi-Chi
[01:29:25] YULA
[01:29:27] um okay if you like YULA build YULA
[01:29:30] she's really cool um yeah if you don't
[01:29:34] like
[01:29:35] YULA and you want to clear the abyss
[01:29:37] please play Shia on one team and child
[01:29:39] on the other why does your child have an
[01:29:41] instructor time
[01:29:46] piece it's like a Bennett uh this
[01:29:49] Bennett is oh my God God you have a sock
[01:29:53] sword on your
[01:29:56] Bennett I wish you showed like you're
[01:29:59] like people did more of like this where
[01:30:02] they would show okay this is a bad
[01:30:04] example where they would show like their
[01:30:05] weapon inventory and stuff so that cuz
[01:30:06] like you probably have you can craft a
[01:30:09] better weapon also your talent level is
[01:30:11] five also somehow you have two no Bless
[01:30:15] oblig but at least you have enough
[01:30:19] ER your talent level on your burst is
[01:30:26] three this is fine we asked for cursed
[01:30:29] accounts we got chis accounts we're not
[01:30:31] going to do the Steve Harvey act
[01:30:33] surprised
[01:30:36] however you can burst once per patch you
[01:30:40] have to use your skill six
[01:30:45] times oh this is this is Oh I thought
[01:30:49] that was your crit
[01:30:50] damage
[01:30:55] what is happening
[01:30:57] here no I'm sorry I'm sorry I have to
[01:31:02] ask okay yo yo yo yo I just have to ask
[01:31:08] I just have to ask what's
[01:31:15] happening I mean this is a cursed
[01:31:17] account I did ask for a cursed account
[01:31:20] it was a cursed account
[01:31:22] uh let me look at your uid I should
[01:31:26] probably [ __ ] I should have done the
[01:31:28] account review on a Sunday so I could
[01:31:29] have done any Talent books and any
[01:31:31] weapon mats [ __ ] I don't want to waake
[01:31:33] wait a
[01:31:34] week 200 ER yeah they should have been
[01:31:36] on yolan bro you should swap your Yan
[01:31:38] and your um officials weapons but we
[01:31:41] could do
[01:31:44] that mostly focusing on Shia cuz his
[01:31:47] damage is embarrassing so Emoji so Emoji
[01:31:50] I guess that makes sense your Sha's
[01:31:51] genuinely not bad though you probably
[01:31:53] want another two-piece or a four piece
[01:31:56] however it is Sunday yeah but like I
[01:31:58] can't do it
[01:31:59] today we're picking the account
[01:32:02] today um a big way to improve your sh's
[01:32:07] damage is by improving your other
[01:32:08] characters I don't know why I'm giving
[01:32:09] the advice now if I'm going to review an
[01:32:11] account but like your Bennett being
[01:32:12] better would improve your sh a lot more
[01:32:14] than if you just like keep farming
[01:32:17] Vermillion cuz your Bennett literally
[01:32:18] does nothing right now he doesn't have
[01:32:20] no bless and his talent level is five on
[01:32:21] a sack sword level 70 you give like six
[01:32:35] attack like yeah your base attack is 516
[01:32:39] my Bennett's base attack is where's
[01:32:43] Bennett my Bennett's base attack is 865
[01:32:48] and then my talent level is like 10
[01:32:50] rightly donated $1 got Don W delay two
[01:32:54] months in a row R I'm sorry I'm
[01:32:58] sorry okay I actually kind of like this
[01:33:02] account but you also they also only have
[01:33:04] 15 fragile which isn't bad but it might
[01:33:06] not be enough if you don't have I don't
[01:33:08] know you might be a hoarder like you
[01:33:10] might have like Talent books and [ __ ]
[01:33:12] but if you don't I like there's only so
[01:33:14] much we can do but maybe let's keep
[01:33:19] looking all right this is a R
[01:33:23] 59 floor
[01:33:26] 11 oh my God this is
[01:33:33] essaying your account was hacked sag
[01:33:36] wait that might that's actually a good
[01:33:38] premise for video wait a second that's a

[02:00:38] book I wanted the
[02:00:39] spear iron sting Kaza but you Triple
[02:00:43] Crown so you get a pass
[02:00:47] Hut listen
[02:00:49] if you don't have enough crit damage
[02:00:51] I'll let it slide but why does nobody
[02:00:54] ever have enough crit rate your yigo
[02:00:57] probably has 50 why does she have
[02:01:00] 50 29 29
[02:01:05] 29 yuo has as
[02:01:11] much okay Yu's good no you have no
[02:01:18] ER
[02:01:30] I'm going to okay there's an epidemic of
[02:01:33] people who don't build enough ER on Yan
[02:01:35] yolan ER requirements I'm Googling this
[02:01:39] what comes up what comes up I'm clicking
[02:01:41] all of these I'm clicking all of these
[02:01:43] how much energy recharge does Yan need
[02:01:46] at 200% ER and energy
[02:01:50] since the E cool down is 10 seconds e
[02:01:53] cool down is you're not doing three e in
[02:01:55] a rotation maybe maybe maybe
[02:01:57] theoretically you would need 30 seconds
[02:01:59] I mean your rotations aren't 30 seconds
[02:02:00] they're like for your information it's
[02:02:02] how much energy and how many okay that's
[02:02:04] good okay you did math the current might
[02:02:06] be and you want to just use two please I
[02:02:08] want to thumbs up it please just that's
[02:02:11] good okay 200% ER you will generate 33
[02:02:14] energy per e okay so lower damage other
[02:02:17] than support weapons having enough the
[02:02:19] hydro 50% ER c z what is the current kit
[02:02:24] thoughts I don't fully agree but that's
[02:02:26] better than 138 that's better than 138 I
[02:02:31] plan to run on her this pause I
[02:02:38] needed 165 is enough for my C1 yolan
[02:02:41] with SRO I am not disagreeing with you
[02:02:45] however is is TW is is Ena Network user
[02:02:48] bald
[02:02:49] using C1 or SRO here I don't think
[02:03:06] so uh this account is pretty funny this
[02:03:09] one is uh also pretty doable I
[02:03:16] think how much is needed I talk about my
[02:03:19] Yong guide
[02:03:24] wow wow poggers no way what's up guys
[02:03:26] welcome to a complete and updated no way
[02:03:29] we talk about it who poggers no way you
[02:03:32] could also use km genuinely if you're
[02:03:35] running your yolan as the only Hydro
[02:03:37] character on your team versus if you
[02:03:38] have another Hydro like Singo a very
[02:03:40] popular meta team that we'll cover later
[02:03:41] or if you run her with r and Shogun or
[02:03:43] if you run her on a fonus weapon weapons
[02:03:46] potentially other characters your energy
[02:03:47] rechar for that I also try to cover in
[02:03:51] guides as deta
[02:03:54] who
[02:03:56] see standard y you want around 200 yeah
[02:04:00] anyways it depends
[02:04:02] depends he doesn't even see donated
[02:04:04] messages wait what did I
[02:04:13] miss I got to go to bed here soon for
[02:04:17] work in morning so I ask that you take a
[02:04:20] quick look I'm not taking accounts sorry
[02:04:23] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry have
[02:04:24] a good badge though I appreciate
[02:04:27] it we're looking through the one
[02:04:29] submitted in Discord otherwise it's not
[02:04:31] fair wait curse account fixing
[02:04:33] application okay I like your characters
[02:04:36] you're a kaching player that's based
[02:04:38] Shang Ling player that's based yolan
[02:04:40] YULA uhh fishal level 50 why is your
[02:04:43] fishal level 50 why is your sucros and
[02:04:46] beta level
[02:04:47] 20
[02:04:49] Hut 66 175 um that's good but I don't
[02:04:53] know what weapon you're
[02:04:56] on but you have 40 Em which means you're
[02:04:58] not on Dragon's vein and you're
[02:05:07] not
[02:05:17] COO what is this what is this what is
[02:05:21] this what is this why is this plus 84 am
[02:05:27] I are my eyes deceiving
[02:05:33] me my Shia has more Elemental Master the
[02:05:37] same Elemental Mastery as your [ __ ]
[02:05:39] Kaza my
[02:05:47] Shia
[02:05:50] 184 ER that I mean the ER is good I
[02:05:53] guess bro I did submit day one
[02:06:00] uh we vetted the accounts and we picked
[02:06:03] the ones that look the most fit however
[02:06:06] for
[02:06:07] kaching um so two be mix and matching
[02:06:10] based on sub stats used to be a really
[02:06:13] good way to play Kain cuz there's so
[02:06:14] many different builds you could do a lot
[02:06:15] of different things since nro came out I
[02:06:18] argue that four thundering Fury is way
[02:06:20] better than anything else because you
[02:06:21] get to spam your skill you get to and
[02:06:23] it's just like a lot more satisfying
[02:06:25] it's better it's what I would recommend
[02:06:26] so that is but let's just
[02:06:39] look okay okay
[02:06:47] look
[02:06:53] okay some characters in gench Impact
[02:06:55] need Elemental Mastery okay Kazu is one
[02:06:57] of them and Nita is one of them please

[02:07:17] disrespect but somehow your
[02:07:19] Nita somehow no disrespect but somehow I

[02:08:01] um they said they were Abyss 73 but they
[02:08:04] put a sad
[02:08:07] face I like Shang Ling unironically so

[02:09:28] player
[02:09:29] okay okay no no no no I have to say
[02:09:32] something before you get the wrong idea
[02:09:34] I genuinely have a belief that if you
[02:09:36] play c0 reminescence mobile Hut you
[02:09:41] either hate your life or you are like
[02:09:44] the best most insane gamer that has ever
[02:09:47] lived there is there is no way you enjoy
[02:09:50] c0 reminescence mobile
[02:09:57] Hut maybe you're just a God maybe you're
[02:10:00] just a God uh what the [ __ ] what how is
[02:10:04] this how is this
[02:10:06] Fair wait these are good pieces you just
[02:10:10] don't you just don't have em wait this
[02:10:12] only plus 12 level it
[02:10:17] okay
[02:10:21] I'm going to move fast
[02:10:35] this put a [ __ ] drum scare
[02:10:44] warning okay in your defense
[02:10:48] some characters when they're inside of a
[02:10:50] state a form they transform and their
[02:10:53] normal attacks don't influence their
[02:10:55] damage when they normal attack in that
[02:10:56] state example is Ryden example is Sino
[02:11:00] right Hut is not one of those
[02:11:04] examples this is it this is the
[02:11:06] one dude I thought the account looked
[02:11:09] normal I saw Hut Singo y I was like this
[02:11:11] is going to be good then I normal attack
[02:11:14] level
[02:11:17] two no set yolon two emblem let's look
[02:11:21] at the energy recharge wait that's
[02:11:22] actually not bad but 38 crit
[02:11:27] rate wait we're not done let's look at
[02:11:29] the kaching
[02:11:30] kaching Aquilla is fine even if you're
[02:11:33] not playing physical High base attack
[02:11:34] 20% attack here it's a underrated Weapon
[02:11:36] It's actually fine like there's better
[02:11:38] options but it's fine it's actually
[02:11:39] fine to Glad 2 TF again really really
[02:11:43] you should really go for
[02:11:46] TF oh no oh we've seen this oh oh no oh
[02:11:54] [Laughter]
[02:11:57] no um okay okay let's look at the fish
[02:12:00] your base I created Another Universe why
[02:12:03] is she level 50 it's okay no it's okay
[02:12:05] it's okay maybe you just need to play
[02:12:06] the game more we're not going to bully
[02:12:08] it's fine um with that said if you have
[02:12:13] artifacts like this and like this then
[02:12:16] surely you can you know level your
[02:12:18] official a little
[02:12:24] bit Nita has a level four
[02:12:28] Talent two-piece deepwood you aren't
[02:12:31] buffing
[02:12:34] anything at least your Yem is wait oh no
[02:12:38] it's only 200 I thought it was higher
[02:12:40] that kaching is not bad okay the kaching
[02:12:43] is a lot worse than it looks be like
[02:12:45] yeah you'll gain crit rate when you
[02:12:46] burst but
[02:12:49] um so first of all you're probably
[02:12:51] playing aggravate or she's bad and like
[02:12:53] or kaching was not ideal before dendro
[02:12:56] POS D she's good because of aggravate if
[02:12:58] you're playing aggravate you probably
[02:12:59] want um I would say em s but if your
[02:13:02] base attack is this [ __ ] high because
[02:13:04] of Aquilla attack sand is probably like
[02:13:06] super competitive so I'm not going to
[02:13:08] roast you on that however um you do want
[02:13:12] wait physical
[02:13:13] Goblin I didn't know I didn't know I
[02:13:15] didn't know know I'm sorry I'm sorry no
[02:13:17] no I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm okay okay we
[02:13:18] might have found the account I listen
[02:13:20] listen listen listen listen physical
[02:13:23] kaching but you're playing kaching your
[02:13:25] team here is
[02:13:46] dendro
[02:13:49] so it said no e
[02:13:57] kaching is fine she's not doing damage
[02:13:59] anyway just build Kaza [ __ ] you official
[02:14:02] A4 is so
[02:14:05] important they don't have
[02:14:09] that that is like this is the person in
[02:14:11] chat the types FAL is not broken they
[02:14:13] they just don't have
[02:14:16] A4 look I'm not posting your account

[02:14:21] saying that is uh that is fire I mean
[02:14:23] yeah you also haven't built official
[02:14:25] though yeah I'll give you a pass on that

[02:15:13] that chat I'm going to keep it real with
[02:15:15] you guys I don't even know if I could

[02:15:32] could do it no dude there's actually is

[02:16:15] fragiles is that enough

[02:27:25] him yet cuz yeah so I it's fine I'll
[02:27:27] give you a pass on
[02:27:33] that wait what was this person's message
[02:27:36] uh wa they had no message it was just a
[02:27:38] smiley face oh no my characters aren't
[02:27:40] that good I'm still trying to build up
[02:27:41] just need some advice and stuff I mean
[02:27:42] that's pretty wholesome I
[02:27:45] guess
[02:27:48] they have allegedly
[02:27:53] allegedly 160 fragile now the only
[02:27:56] problem
[02:27:57] is I'm not doubting them right but also
[02:28:01] their ID is extremely old no that's mine
[02:28:03] never mind uh 6 I'm not doubting them
[02:28:09] 142,000 okay B you are my number one bit
[02:28:12] donor so I don't want to Dono all you
[02:28:13] however I can't do account reviews from
[02:28:15] U IDs but I'll still check
[02:28:17] however minus 200 however
[02:28:23] listen I I am fearful and now I believe
[02:28:27] them right they probably said they said
[02:28:29] 160 they have 160 FR that's insane there
[02:28:31] is just a slight chance that they might
[02:28:34] have typed 160 meaning they have 160
[02:28:37] resin and if that is the case I will be
[02:28:41] furious but I'm gonna assume that they
[02:28:44] have 160 fragile I just I don't know I
[02:28:47] don't trust it
[02:28:52] I no I am balls thank you
[02:28:55] hopeful R
[02:28:59] mons just ask yeah yeah I mean I could
[02:29:02] ask but I don't know if they're
[02:29:15] here
[02:29:39] H notore sorry donated
[02:29:42] $3 you just lost you three and your
[02:29:46] manually breathing I'm not manually
[02:29:48] breathing freak you you're manually
[02:29:54] breathing huh okay well I am in a pickle
[02:29:58] right
[02:30:02] now even if they had 160 would you have
[02:30:04] time to spend it I'd spend at least a
[02:30:06] 100 cuz that's a banger like
[02:30:11] thumbnail do you watch an NA airport
[02:30:13] speedrun or no
[02:30:15] dude when has na ever impressed you be
[02:30:18] honest no be honest be dead ass who
[02:30:20] watches the league Esports first of all
[02:30:22] second of all who watches it to be
[02:30:24] impressed by NA that's two things right
[02:30:31] there didn't even get I don't want talk
[02:30:34] about
[02:30:44] it just check my AI 48 Hut I'm not
[02:30:48] checking your H 65
[02:30:52] m575
[02:30:55] 610 they won Val Champions yes Val is
[02:30:57] the only time where well we got [ __ ]
[02:30:59] for like a year but now we won so I'm
[02:31:01] happy however I will say I think the
[02:31:04] only reason na is winning in Val is
[02:31:05] because all the good EU players are
[02:31:07] playing CS however I hope I'm wrong and
[02:31:10] I hope we keep winning and I would be I
[02:31:13] would love it if we kept winning that's
[02:31:15] all I'm saying that's all I'm
[02:31:18] saying that's all I'm saying I hope
[02:31:22] so okay anyways
[02:31:24] [Music]

[02:31:36] battle passes to have 160 and they're

[02:38:24] dragon's Bane rden I forgot what a
[02:38:27] [ __ ] Legend John impact okay
[02:38:31] uh I mean this isn't bad I just don't
[02:38:33] know why you're going em Sans if you're
[02:38:35] going Electro and crit I mean okay to
[02:38:38] start
[02:38:39] Nita yeah one two
[02:38:41] one at least they on four deepwood okay
[02:38:45] uh
[02:38:50] um okay it's
[02:38:53] fine Rosaria Jade
[02:38:56] spear crit cryo
[02:39:00] attack wait the rosar is actually kind
[02:39:02] of fine yeah the rosar is
[02:39:05] fine
[02:39:06] okay uh official might need a little bit
[02:39:10] of
[02:39:11] leveling 34 as well think the same for
[02:39:13] every transformative reaction I guess
[02:39:15] that would make sense
[02:39:26] dude John impact I mean it's not even
[02:39:29] it's not that bad
[02:39:33] though yeah this one doesn't look as bad
[02:39:35] I don't think John looks as
[02:39:43] bad I liked this um this account I don't
[02:39:49] know their name I like the mobile CZ Hut
[02:39:52] account but they had like no
[02:40:05] resin I do think that was the funniest
[02:40:08] one wait let me look at their thing
[02:40:14] again
[02:40:17] wait actually they had 23 that's not
[02:40:20] even bad I just don't think it's enough
[02:40:22] but like surely we could do it let's say
[02:40:24] 30 cuz fragile and then we could refresh
[02:40:26] let's say
[02:40:27] 30 plus 160 so let's say 30 time 60
[02:40:31] which is 1,800 plus we add let's say 200
[02:40:34] let's say 2K 2K is
[02:40:37] like I mean 2K is
[02:40:44] doable
[02:41:05] help the account with 84 em on their
[02:41:07] Kaza was it not this one wait which one
[02:41:10] yeah it was this one this is the one
[02:41:11] that has 84 yeah I think this is the
[02:41:13] account that needs it the most the only
[02:41:15] problem is usually I review like most of
[02:41:17] my accounts are accounts like this that
[02:41:19] really need help which is still what I
[02:41:21] want to do but I wanted to do one where
[02:41:22] it's like I also actually like spend the
[02:41:26] resin myself and actually go farming and
[02:41:28] stuff which I can
[02:41:30] do however if they don't have that much
[02:41:33] fragile then it's harder to make it into
[02:41:35] like a different thing I do think this
[02:41:39] account does need saving though this one
[02:41:40] is uh I like
[02:41:43] it just do two
[02:41:48] it's also not a bad take okay well I'll
[02:41:51] keep this one for
[02:41:55] sure okay this one moves to the final
[02:41:57] round then we need one that has a [ __ ]
[02:41:59] ton of
[02:42:04] fragiles Chi-Chi favored I like
[02:42:09] that
[02:42:14] sorry let's scroll TR open the tarag

[02:47:02] sucros [ __ ] it you can play flying
[02:47:04] sucros SRO cooki Nita and then you play
[02:47:07] like Bennett
[02:47:09] ficial no you probably play national no
[02:47:13] uh but you're also a by
[02:47:15] but you also could play kaching you play
[02:47:17] kaching BYU
[02:47:20] aggravate
[02:47:23] yeah yeah you play okay if we play this
[02:47:26] account it would be kaching FAL sucros
[02:47:28] BYU and then the other
[02:47:32] team should be like either Nita
[02:47:36] something or Shang Ling something that
[02:47:38] just depends on
[02:47:43] you
[02:47:45] yeah uh you could do ayato auki and then
[02:47:48] that's a hyper blo team and then your
[02:47:49] last St could be anyone the only problem
[02:47:51] with those two teams is you're not using
[02:47:52] Bennett which it's not like a problem
[02:47:54] but it's like if you have them spare
[02:47:55] usually is like really good but if
[02:47:57] you're not playing like your both of
[02:47:59] your teams are dendro so it's like yeah
[02:48:02] you could do yeah you could do we could
[02:48:03] do IO hyper blue and then
[02:48:07] kaching you could shove Vu on that team
[02:48:09] and play National on the other half yeah
[02:48:12] we could do AO Nita kie BYU
[02:48:16] true and then the other team would be
[02:48:19] Singo Bennett Shang Ling and then like
[02:48:22] Scara because you like Scara or
[02:48:29] sucros ah this account is
[02:48:42] doable yo you got me [ __ ] up if you
[02:48:45] think I'm clicking this long ass
[02:48:52] link what about wander salad that was
[02:48:54] the first team I suggested the first
[02:48:55] team I suggested was wander kie Nita SRO
[02:48:59] but like at that point your ito's just
[02:49:02] benched I mean I guess it's fine if Ito
[02:49:04] like it's up to you cuz we're going to
[02:49:06] bench one of these characters anyway you
[02:49:07] have too many DPSS so one of them is
[02:49:09] getting benched wait which one has the
[02:49:10] most dog [ __ ]
[02:49:12] weapon your it on fa
[02:49:16] um what is your wander on whith
[02:49:24] okay does cookie work with flying sucros
[02:49:27] uh you can't okay to be honest you would
[02:49:29] probably go sucros in that team or you
[02:49:31] would go full em wanders and then he
[02:49:33] would swirl and you play fishal so you
[02:49:35] do wander fishal syro Nita and then you
[02:49:37] don't
[02:49:39] heal or BYU no it's not of
[02:49:43] dandro
[02:49:53] IO doesn't have a weapon choice at
[02:49:56] all I mean you could you could go like
[02:50:00] like
[02:50:13] flute Kaz story weapon they don't have
[02:50:26] it new Fontan
[02:50:30] yeah there is new Fontan true or even
[02:50:34] Amino I
[02:50:35] guess Harbinger is right there yeah but
[02:50:38] he doesn't have a team that could on
[02:50:39] Harbinger the [ __ ] are we going to do
[02:50:41] how are you going to keep
[02:50:43] harbinger

[02:50:53] them okay this account is also for
[02:50:56] consideration now chat what do we think
[02:50:58] I think okay John impact I like his name
[02:51:01] because it's [ __ ] John impact however
[02:51:03] his account is very normal I think he
[02:51:05] just needs to work on it a little it be
[02:51:06] good uh this
[02:51:08] account the mobile no the mobile Hut
[02:51:12] one I think is
[02:51:15] really good but they have like no
[02:51:16] fragile so it would be for another video
[02:51:18] so I might save the account and then the
[02:51:20] other one is this
[02:51:22] one wait there's also this what the [ __ ]
[02:51:25] was this one again they have a moon
[02:51:26] piercer Soo there ain't no [ __ ] way
[02:51:28] you're Moon piercer Soo I mean it's not
[02:51:30] that bad this one's
[02:51:34] [Applause]
[02:51:40] also then there's the new
[02:51:43] one
[02:51:46] okay I think the most cursed part about
[02:51:48] this one has 90 fragile resin
[02:51:54] 97 and
[02:51:56] also is mooner better than disco jum I
[02:51:59] don't even think it's better I don't
[02:52:00] think it was better than white tassel is
[02:52:04] it is it I mean I have a weapon raing in
[02:52:07] my video but I don't know if it included
[02:52:09] Moon piercer cuz I don't know if Z Jeff
[02:52:10] even knew that was a [ __ ] weapon heit

[02:53:37] builds but it it is definitely very
[02:53:40] scuffed and they have like a 100 fragile
[02:53:43] resin and all all of the ratios are dog
[02:53:45] [ __ ] I think the main scuff thing like
[02:53:48] no no disrespect I think the main scuff
[02:53:50] thing is that their
[02:53:52] AR they are
[02:53:54] ar50 with

[03:11:07] three cuz I heard it's like long as [ __ ]
[03:11:10] so I don't know I'm sure I'll enjoy it
[03:11:12] if the writing's good I like it but like
[03:11:14] I don't
[03:11:28] know did Z Jeff do it what was his take
[03:11:32] or did he not do
[03:11:33] yet act three is badge hold like this
[03:11:36] like 5 hours wait how long did act two
[03:11:38] take didn't that take me like 8 hours or
[03:11:40] some [ __ ] act one and two didn't act one
[03:11:42] and two take me like 6 hours or no eight
[03:11:44] it was like lit literally eight
[03:11:46] right he did R it 6 out of
[03:11:50] 10 he liked act
[03:11:55] three okay that means I'm going to not
[03:11:57] like act three and like act
[03:12:01] four our opinions are usually the exact
[03:12:06] opposite bow your
[03:12:11] head
[03:12:20] what if you never did the ark Quest from
[03:12:22] now on I wouldn't get the world boss and
[03:12:24] uh I do not want to live in that
[03:12:35] reality yeah we're probably going to get
[03:12:37] a new world boss soon no sus or not
[03:12:40] World boss like weekly boss no sus no no
[03:12:42] sus but like
[03:12:45] yeah four is the best
[03:12:48] one
[03:12:50] really a bitter pill to swallow remember
[03:12:54] help the tid's
[03:13:10] beckon okay I'm down I'm down I'm done
[03:13:13] as long as they don't
[03:13:15] [ __ ] Ino Zuma it bow your
[03:13:23] head I can't wait for it to be revealed
[03:13:25] that finina is just a puppet all along
[03:13:27] and then the finina we know isn't
[03:13:29] actually finina and her name
[03:13:31] is f and then we have to learn a new
[03:13:35] name oh wait
[03:13:38] that's that's good that's good that's
[03:13:40] good that's good that's good that's good
[03:13:41] that's good that's that's good that's
[03:13:44] good there's pot if it rolls there's
[03:13:47] potential
[03:13:52] here every time this rolls em I will ban
[03:13:54] a random chatter however we know this
[03:13:56] won't Roll Em it's going to roll crit
[03:13:58] maybe one HP it's going to be perfect
[03:14:01] it's going to be perfect n at peace oh
[03:14:03] it's perfect for Hut but Hut doesn't
[03:14:05] really want this set but maybe maybe in
[03:14:07] the future who knows
[03:14:10] s gift sub then
[03:14:16] sus well cuz people are like ah who to
[03:14:18] needs it but like either everyone of my
[03:14:20] chat's a [ __ ] dumbass who can't read
[03:14:22] or probably the hyra Hydra archon like
[03:14:25] [ __ ] with your HP so it's like one or
[03:14:26] the other and I'm going to assume you
[03:14:27] guys aren't stupid so probably something
[03:14:30] but like no no
[03:14:32] leaks cuz if you guys think that before
[03:14:35] any new character comes out you use this
[03:14:37] on Hut you might be running buron or
[03:14:40] burning outside of that it's like why
[03:14:42] are you misinforming
[03:14:46] people but
[03:14:55] yeah to any other the
[03:15:02] BR okay I'm sorry you can say this is an
[03:15:05] unjust ban and honestly it is but this
[03:15:07] person manifesting only Em I'm sorry I

[03:15:24] you can't blame me you can't blame me

[03:15:27] for a minute I'm

[03:19:39] the only bad one
[03:19:46] okay it could still be like a Hut piece

[03:19:51] okay it's
[03:20:09] okay okay

[03:20:15] be an amazing Hut pce

[03:20:21] the most but
[03:20:31] hey I
[03:20:35] mean it's like fine it's like it's a lot
[03:20:38] of stats it's a lot of stats it's is
[03:20:42] just a bad outcome like the potential
[03:20:45] was here but the the worst outcome was
[03:20:48] still a decent outcome it's like okay
[03:20:50] it's not just like the the the em and
[03:20:53] the PV help a
[03:20:56] lot [ __ ] I have so many
[03:21:05] [Music]
[03:21:10] flowers
[03:21:18] Grand Fortune
[03:21:20] lra why you typing lra it's not even the
[03:21:23] right
[03:21:28] game crit damage is also really good on
[03:21:30] the set because you get so much crit
[03:21:31] rate from it so like for especially for
[03:21:33] a character like Linny or something it's
[03:21:34] like lowkey the only St you
[03:21:40] need
[03:21:52] wow Elemental Mastery again it's all
[03:21:55] good it's all good dude don't let one
[03:21:58] bad roll ruin your like your your
[03:22:00] momentum you
[03:22:02] know
[03:22:03] okay
[03:22:07] um all right there's more there's more
[03:22:09] we dude [ __ ] flowers we have so many
[03:22:10] flowers let's get like a
[03:22:15] um what would be yo low key my HP stands
[03:22:19] is kind of balls so we have like five HP
[03:22:22] Sands we could roll all of these HP
[03:22:25] Sands could be amazing if their last sub
[03:22:27] stat is the other crit stat that they
[03:22:29] don't have for example here would be
[03:22:30] crit rate so there's potential
[03:22:37] here wait what let me cook let me cook
[03:22:39] let me cook everyone let me cook let me
[03:22:41] cook
[03:22:57] okay this has to be a joke dude dude
[03:23:00] dude dude dude dude how no no I'm
[03:23:02] actually serious how is this even
[03:23:05] possible every piece is just the
[03:23:09] M it's every piece
[03:23:20] dude I don't even want to level this
[03:23:22] anymore I'm sorry I'm actually sorry
[03:23:25] yeah I should roll gilded or
[03:23:33] something d i I actually can't make this
[03:23:36] up let's do one more let's do one more
[03:23:37] maybe this one will get crit damage cuz
[03:23:39] there's no em here so if there's no em
[03:23:41] if it gets crit damage we're just
[03:23:42] objectively
[03:23:46] happy
[03:24:00] defense this could be
[03:24:04] good you feel love Chris review forms uh
[03:24:07] we have like potential accounts we I
[03:24:09] like lowy tried to decide today and then
[03:24:11] we like
[03:24:13] that was the
[03:24:17] wrong it's because your Lux and
[03:24:19] Vermilion no it's not I don't have
[03:24:21] Vermillion
[03:24:33] luck okay at least we didn't get um
[03:24:35] maybe it's a comeback
[03:24:37] Arc uh we want to crit rates no crit
[03:24:41] damage ciret but we mostly want a crit
[03:24:44] damage
[03:24:45] ciret wait no am I wait what ciret am I
[03:24:47] on I'm on a crit damage one I think yeah
[03:24:50] let's roll this
[03:24:52] one dude this is a good Circle I think I
[03:24:54] got this off stream 6.2 crit damage uh
[03:24:57] this set usually wants crit damage
[03:24:58] circlets not crit rate but it could
[03:25:00] still be good so we'll see is this guy
[03:25:03] Em I'm ending stream it got er I saw
[03:25:05] it play Wolf by Exo I I don't want to
[03:25:09] play a song called wolf
[03:25:13] that is very furry of
[03:25:21] you this piece could be good yeah that
[03:25:23] has crit damage and ER so
[03:25:26] like yeah can I throw this shot be
[03:25:29] honest okay fine I'll quue
[03:25:34] it no don't throw it okay who am I going
[03:25:37] to [ __ ] use this
[03:25:40] on you're going to going to regret it if
[03:25:42] you throw it out how
[03:25:45] how if you want HP you'd rather have
[03:25:47] crit on substats if you want em you'd
[03:25:49] rather have em main stack crit sub stats
[03:25:50] other than vice versa and then if you
[03:25:52] want both HP and EM then you're coping
[03:25:55] it's like
[03:25:59] Hut and even if it is H this is like
[03:26:01] probably
[03:26:10] suboptimal
[03:26:17] it's not SOL at all I mean yes it is
[03:26:19] optimal is you get like em roll on all
[03:26:22] five of your pieces and then you don't
[03:26:24] need to like turbo invest in it and then
[03:26:25] you still have crit rolls I think this
[03:26:27] is cope I could be wrong [ __ ] it if I'm
[03:26:30] wrong I'm
[03:26:33] wrong okay well now we have two bad
[03:26:36] pieces it went from one bad piece to two
[03:26:38] bad
[03:26:40] pieces
[03:26:52] um I mean I could level a HP goblet for
[03:26:56] no reason at all I did I don't even
[03:27:06] know what if Chlor is HP Skilling
[03:27:10] aggravate oh yeah
[03:27:12] yeah I yeah of course HP scaling
[03:27:15] aggravate that would want an em substat
[03:27:17] Sands [ __ ] you [ __ ]
[03:27:19] listen here listen here listen here
[03:27:21] listen
[03:27:23] here I have not once used this piece not
[03:27:28] once in it's High
[03:27:30] Rolls not
[03:27:40] once
[03:27:52] what is the song I don't know it's too
[03:27:53] quiet I can't hear it I don't want to
[03:27:55] know what it
[03:27:58] is I think it's a furry
[03:28:03] song okay these flowers actually have
[03:28:05] potential though we can end on like a
[03:28:06] banger piece dude could you imagine
[03:28:10] could you imagine the delectability if
[03:28:13] this gets crit rate imagine how
[03:28:14] delectable this would
[03:28:19] be
[03:28:21] coward uh okay all right I mean wait
[03:28:25] that's not even bad though that's not
[03:28:26] even bad I
[03:28:28] mean get one more
[03:28:32] level w we got y yay okay never mind uh
[03:28:37] let's level let's level let's
[03:28:40] level
[03:28:46] I need another good piece to end on
[03:28:49] chat chat we need to get piece stand
[03:28:53] on this attack sand could be good for no
[03:28:57] oh goblets Electro wait the electro
[03:28:59] goblet that's actually
[03:29:01] juicy that's actually a
[03:29:08] juicer wait this one is crit damage with
[03:29:10] HP for % could be really good for uh
[03:29:12] could be really good for uh new
[03:29:21] villet
[03:29:36] okay we now have despite the tragedy
[03:29:39] that just happened we now have an
[03:29:41] electro goblet with crit an damage now
[03:29:43] while I wish this were on Golden troop
[03:29:44] for official or Yi surely someone can
[03:29:47] use this who knows future font 10
[03:29:50] characters CL clind and then if this
[03:29:54] okay if this goblet rolls full crit I'll
[03:29:57] put her in the thumbnail and then it'll
[03:29:59] be like oh my god oh wow I have to click
[03:30:02] on this video now that's a good
[03:30:05] idea so you know maybe this will roll
[03:30:08] crit and then I could put her in the
[03:30:10] thumbnail
[03:30:11] that is a crit roll hey the defense
[03:30:13] sucks but that's a crit roll let me cook
[03:30:15] let me cook let me cook step back from
[03:30:18] the kitchen I'm
[03:30:21] cooking wait that's another crit
[03:30:28] roll crit damage
[03:30:30] please I don't want too much crit rate
[03:30:32] cuz the set gives me crit rate and also
[03:30:34] if she's a sword character my only good
[03:30:35] sword is Jade cutter so I'm going to
[03:30:37] have way too much crit rate but it's
[03:30:38] okay I'll pull for her weapon because I
[03:30:40] would do anything she asks so I'll get
[03:30:42] crit damage here and we'll be
[03:30:45] happy I talk too much
[03:30:48] I it's okay that's
[03:30:52] okay it's still good one more coll is
[03:30:55] good you talk about I'll shut up I'll
[03:30:57] shut up no more
[03:31:09] words
[03:31:14] okay actually not bad this is actually
[03:31:22] fine it's
[03:31:25] okay it's
[03:31:30] okay crit rate on crit rate set shut
[03:31:34] your mouth I'm sorry that was toxic I
[03:31:36] know I know I know what do you want from
[03:31:39] me it's okay it's fine it's okay it's
[03:31:42] fine it's okay could also be an off
[03:31:45] piece set true uh piece true use Loi
[03:31:49] wait true actually
[03:31:52] true I do have I forget I have Loi
[03:32:09] sometimes
[03:32:16] I still have more resin to spend I'm not
[03:32:17] done I just want to get a good piece
[03:32:20] okay this could be amazing uh crit
[03:32:21] damage is like the main side you need on
[03:32:22] the set hp% would be insane for nevet 2
[03:32:25] or neet right now really good build but
[03:32:27] wants a little bit more HP if we can so
[03:32:29] either of these would be
[03:32:35] great okay
[03:32:39] maybe
[03:32:43] okay that's good the flat HP was bad but
[03:32:45] this is good this is more you're
[03:32:47] speaking my language now I have no MOA
[03:32:49] and no artifacts dude what is happening
[03:32:52] I'm going to throw a piece we got I'm
[03:32:54] sorry can I throw a piece we
[03:33:09] got
[03:33:15] X2 what do we
[03:33:18] get wait not bad yo okay flat HP sucks
[03:33:23] you want hp% but the crit damage is good
[03:33:25] because this is like kind of Blizzard St
[03:33:26] for some characters like Linny he needs
[03:33:28] a lot of crit damage but you already got
[03:33:30] a ton of crit rate on him kind of like
[03:33:32] AKA is the flat HP useless yes but it's
[03:33:36] okay it's okay 25 CR damage is hella low
[03:33:39] no it's fine it's
[03:33:46] fine
[03:33:47] it's I mean okay it's not ideal but it's
[03:33:53] fine I can use on
[03:33:56] LY Linny needs like no sub stats dude
[03:33:59] you get so much attack doesn't [ __ ]
[03:34:00] matter and you get so much crit rate for
[03:34:01] free and you barely need ER like you get
[03:34:03] some Er rolls and you're
[03:34:09] fine
[03:34:19] what's the highest crital you
[03:34:21] got
[03:34:27] 41.2 Pepe W only happened once though
[03:34:30] who asked I
[03:34:34] asked okay let's roll this one let's
[03:34:38] going be good I'm broke as [ __ ] though
