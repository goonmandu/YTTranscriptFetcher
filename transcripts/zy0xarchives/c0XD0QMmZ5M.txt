[00:12:12] sh
[00:12:14] era let's just say that plunging will be
[00:12:21] rewarded let's just
[00:12:23] say that duuke actually feels good I'm
[00:12:26] not kidding I was plunging 300 K is
[00:12:29] against the Tula no exaggeration by the
[00:12:32] way like 320k you'll see it in the
[00:12:36] video I'm just saying it is a beautiful
[00:12:40] day to be a plunger like me huta also
[00:12:44] felt amazing by the
[00:12:46] way yeah I felt okay rizzly made me want
[00:12:48] to jump off a cliff um but we'll talk
[00:12:50] about it when we get there there's a lot
[00:12:53] to unpack also I'm going to say this
[00:12:55] right now because I know everyone's
[00:12:57] going to be calling shenyun and [ __ ]
[00:12:59] she's not and if you think she is uh you
[00:13:02] are self-reporting your own skill
[00:13:04] issue we are going to talk about it so
[00:13:08] I'm going to Crown duuke
[00:13:10] today and we're going to be playing a
[00:13:12] lot of different teams hello
[00:13:15] J how are you dude we actually have so
[00:13:17] much content like not even
[00:13:22] cope go [ __ ] yourself wait
[00:13:25] why
[00:13:27] dude first of all look at
[00:13:33] her
[00:13:35] lament C punes are usually stronger yes
[00:13:37] duuke has the highest Skilling punch in
[00:13:39] the game apart from like sh's burst but
[00:13:42] yeah now there's something I want to
[00:13:47] say I'm I'm not a corporate worker I'm a
[00:13:50] sh salesman there's something I want to
[00:13:52] say chat she is objectively distracting
[00:13:55] to
[00:13:56] play and that's not a bad thing okay
[00:13:59] if there's one thing that unites how do
[00:14:01] I say this very eloquently if there's
[00:14:04] one thing that unites every person in
[00:14:05] this
[00:14:07] world I mean Shena I mean [ __ ] Shen Yun
[00:14:10] has two of them so that and very
[00:14:13] flexible as a support you are going to
[00:14:15] see
[00:14:17] so we um we're going to pull for her I'm
[00:14:20] also going to pull for a signature
[00:14:21] weapon now you have Ox what the [ __ ] you
[00:14:23] don't pull on weapon banners what the
[00:14:25] what the [ __ ] you're not a whales Ox you
[00:14:26] don't pull on weapon banners what the
[00:14:28] [ __ ]
[00:14:29] true however there's a few things to
[00:14:32] consider first of all as a catalyst I
[00:14:35] could give her thrilling Tales but
[00:14:36] that's kind of lame on a Vermilion sh
[00:14:38] that's one two two shut the [ __ ] sorry
[00:14:42] two o Thor and I is the go-to freet to
[00:14:45] playay option I just spoiled the guy
[00:14:46] there you go oor ey great for so many
[00:14:48] people do you know what refinement rank
[00:14:51] my oor I can
[00:14:53] get two for some reason I only stopped
[00:14:57] at R2 what the [ __ ] happened happened
[00:14:58] during this event I don't know I only
[00:15:00] have R2 I actually don't know how this
[00:15:03] happened I don't know but I only have an
[00:15:06] we're not using that I'm not using that
[00:15:08] so we I do want her signature I want it
[00:15:12] don't talk to me shut up don't talk to
[00:15:14] me I want it I want her signature okay
[00:15:17] there's very good freeo play
[00:15:19] options but I want it Shan flat attack
[00:15:22] is lame on shiao no it isn't she gives
[00:15:23] you a huge attack buff similar to Shena
[00:15:25] quills which is then multiplied by
[00:15:27] Shia's crit and damage that therefore it
[00:15:29] is a very big buff it also gets like VAP
[00:15:32] it could get vaporized or melted so if
[00:15:34] you play duuke if you play Hut or gaming
[00:15:36] that is great if you play a Quicken
[00:15:38] aggravator well then it doesn't work so
[00:15:39] get [ __ ] rip Bozo but it is what it is
[00:15:41] uh anyways yeah so that's what's going
[00:15:44] to happen today um we're going to
[00:15:48] pull there for villion this is value
[00:15:50] relative to Mar CH true however not true
[00:15:52] because Shia runs a crit weapon with a
[00:15:54] crit Ascension and Cloud retainer gives
[00:15:56] you 10% crit rate because of all these
[00:15:58] when you fact after that plus his crit
[00:15:59] Ascension and the crit rate for Mar CH
[00:16:01] while it can technically be optimal and
[00:16:03] slightly above Vermillion in practice
[00:16:05] this means avoiding every single crit
[00:16:07] rate substat except one which means that
[00:16:09] in practice you get less valuable roles
[00:16:10] because you're not going to be looking
[00:16:12] you're going to have one dead stat two
[00:16:13] dead stats in your artifact because ER
[00:16:14] is useless in a triple anemo team so
[00:16:16] you're only going to be looking for crit
[00:16:17] damage and attack percent therefore it
[00:16:18] is easier to build your sh but at Max
[00:16:20] investment you have two [ __ ] dead
[00:16:22] stats whereas Vermillion can mid Max and
[00:16:24] optimize attack you don't really need ER
[00:16:26] crit damage and crit rate uh equated for
[00:16:28] more optimality unless you purely avoid
[00:16:31] cred on all your Mar RS which isn't
[00:16:39] realistic who the [ __ ] is ZaZa like the
[00:16:51] emote
[00:16:54] anyways stop defending
[00:16:56] Vermillion don't talk to me we are going
[00:16:59] to pull right
[00:17:00] now we are going to
[00:17:02] pull right now right here

[00:24:30] Synergy with Shia two uh you get you can
[00:24:33] choose her for free from the lantern
[00:24:35] right if you want c0 and then three is
[00:24:38] anything past C 0 is not great C6 gives
[00:24:41] you a bit of Dent drop C1 gives you
[00:24:43] dener damage I was like oh oh someone
[00:24:44] replied to my Tweet someone replied to
[00:24:46] my Tweet someone replied to my tweet I
[00:24:47] didn't want to expose them I didn't want
[00:24:48] to literally expose their entire
[00:24:50] Heritage they're literally
[00:24:51] like isn't there a yo Yao com that Buffs
[00:24:55] damage yes but guess what all of y y
[00:24:58] teams with the exception of like one
[00:24:59] without Al hey but why are you playing
[00:25:01] her without Al heym when you could just
[00:25:02] go like half of the cast instead doesn't
[00:25:05] really run a dendro DPS usually you're
[00:25:06] running like kaching with ya yaa or like
[00:25:08] an aggravate with Yao ya so it's very
[00:25:10] rare that the dendro damage is actually
[00:25:11] relevant
[00:25:13] however she's a good character so that
[00:25:16] is why I ewed I apologize for anyone who
[00:25:18] was like Zach how could you obviously I
[00:25:20] wasn't Ewing Shia I was Ewing the others
[00:25:23] okay okay uh I didn't even look at the
[00:25:25] weapon
[00:25:26] Banner
[00:25:28] it's it's all this this catalyst is
[00:25:30] really good it's very flexible but the
[00:25:32] Jade spear is like a standard Banner
[00:25:33] weapon so I don't like like I love Jade
[00:25:35] spear but I don't like when a standard
[00:25:37] Banner weapon is raid up so you know
[00:25:39] it's up to you like it's good it's great
[00:25:40] for Shia don't get me wrong but yeah it
[00:25:43] is a standard weapon um and then these
[00:25:46] are fours are pretty good wion is great
[00:25:48] fance is great stringless is great linar
[00:25:50] is situationally good but I feel like
[00:25:51] it's been on a million banners by now
[00:25:52] lithic Clay is honestly not bad it's
[00:25:54] actually pretty good for gaming sorry
[00:25:55] guming but uh you might might be
[00:25:57] overcapped on crit rate so be careful
[00:25:59] but lithic blade is not bad especially
[00:26:01] cuz ging's from Le and so is Shen Yun
[00:26:04] and so is I think that's everyone you're
[00:26:06] going to use in this team that's from
[00:26:07] there Rosaria isn't Bennett isn't finina
[00:26:08] isn't kazwa
[00:26:10] isn't yeah there might be other teams of
[00:26:13] him though I haven't fully looked into
[00:26:15] him yet well I have but we'll talk about
[00:26:17] it later why are you dressed up like
[00:26:19] you're going to spread the word of
[00:26:23] Jesus

[00:31:24] quills the equivalent of 200% of her
[00:31:26] attack for eight punes 200% of her
[00:31:29] attack that's then added with your
[00:31:31] character's attack multiplied by their
[00:31:33] crit by their damage percent and then
[00:31:34] [ __ ] vaporized or melted or whatever
[00:31:36] the

[00:32:26] what the [ __ ] is wrong with this
[00:32:28] um it's
[00:32:32] fine
[00:32:34] also I noticed a fast equip button and I
[00:32:38] really don't want to use it because I
[00:32:40] already know what's going to happen this
[00:32:42] menu sorting is going to give me an
[00:32:44] aneurysm and I don't want to do this
[00:32:45] live on stream but you know what let's
[00:32:48] try it we've been asking for artifact
[00:32:49] presets for 3
[00:32:52] years well we've only started yeah I
[00:32:54] guess it's been around 3 years two and a
[00:32:56] half half

[00:33:21] what why is there oh priority okay I
[00:33:25] don't know let's just do this
[00:33:33] what no suitable
[00:33:36] artifacts oh all all all oh so I can
[00:33:40] [ __ ] other character builds I see okay
[00:33:43] generate again wait check
[00:33:48] Alternatives oh you could change like
[00:33:50] one piece of the build okay that's
[00:33:51] actually not I mean it's not great but
[00:33:53] it's better than nothing I guess maybe
[00:33:56] wait what if I I want to
[00:34:01] change okay equip does this save them
[00:34:04] though what if I want to do another
[00:34:08] one
[00:34:11] generate oh I see and then if I want to
[00:34:14] change let's I want to go song of days

[00:35:04] this is still kind of annoying does it
[00:35:05] filter for me okay it does filter for me
[00:35:08] at least it does that okay we might use
[00:35:10] it still not what I wish it was but at
[00:35:12] least we might use it maybe
[00:35:18] uh yeah we might use
[00:35:23] it meow yeah it's a lot worse than what
[00:35:27] it should be but it's slightly better
[00:35:29] than nothing so uh no comment I
[00:35:33] guess the trial is so much better why
[00:35:35] let's
[00:35:39] see why did I'm not even reading your
[00:35:41] name thanks for the prime
[00:35:50] though oh my God he's on serpent spine
[00:35:54] he's actually on his best in slot
[00:36:02] yo tell me if it's C6 bet it
[00:36:10] no whoa I just [ __ ] plunged all over
[00:36:14] him all right watch
[00:36:16] this s is
[00:36:19] uh guming is a choice but you know many
[00:36:22] happy
[00:36:25] returns
[00:36:31] whoa where's my dog there he
[00:36:36] is that's pretty cool better than Shia I
[00:36:40] mean no but he is
[00:36:45] fun this also my first time playing
[00:36:47] guming I know how to build him but I
[00:36:48] haven't actually played him I played
[00:36:49] shenyun though shenyun I know how to
[00:36:50] play guming I haven't played
[00:36:54] yet all right cool
[00:36:58] other oh wait that's cool wait why is
[00:37:02] that wasn't ging's
[00:37:08] trial okay wow this team is
[00:37:12] ass I
[00:37:15] mean this is so much
[00:37:20] worse maybe c v it no
[00:37:25] stars stars
[00:37:27] shine wait I need to get my my homie yes
[00:37:30] sir [ __ ] I
[00:37:32] missed also what's nice about him is his
[00:37:34] P replication he hits very hard but very
[00:37:37] slow which means you can actually melt
[00:37:40] or vaporize every hit there are
[00:37:42] virtually zero characters in the game
[00:37:44] that can actually like consistently well
[00:37:46] you can melt with like K like Rosaria
[00:37:48] swirl not Rosaria cosos swirl with
[00:37:51] deluke but typically melting is annoying
[00:37:55] but you actually can with him which let
[00:37:56] go team
[00:37:59] is up to itai up to
[00:38:01] it wait what's this homie
[00:38:06] called oh I swapped out of him
[00:38:09] oops be
[00:38:18] amazed right
[00:38:24] go monai I see
[00:38:29] cool all right we got to stop caring
[00:38:30] about this right now because we need
[00:38:34] to not a paid comment but just want to
[00:38:37] thank my streamer for 21 of keeping me
[00:38:40] not listen not listen not listen not to
[00:38:44] be rash but we need to level these
[00:38:46] [ __ ] characters and look this mat
[00:38:48] isn't [ __ ] out this mat isn't bro I
[00:38:51] need to get flowers and a boss that just
[00:38:53] came
[00:38:54] out so that's just f [ __ ] for Mr
[00:38:57] guming I literally prearm though I have
[00:39:00] the Ki and I have the emperor's resolusi
[00:39:03] but we don't have um the shenyun [ __ ] so
[00:39:08] uh I might need your worlds to those who
[00:39:10] aren't pulling for uh those
[00:39:13] characters [ __ ] it fast equip let's see
[00:39:15] if this works actually E I don't feel
[00:39:17] like doing this I actually don't feel
[00:39:19] like it uh I'm going to give him serpent
[00:39:20] spacy it's actually pretty good for him
[00:39:22] actually it's his best in slot I'm going
[00:39:23] to say it there's a lot of weapons you
[00:39:25] can run on him
[00:39:27] um verdict is really good Beacon is
[00:39:28] really good but serpent spine is just
[00:39:30] the best if you're free to play m
[00:39:31] flowers that's for you all right
[00:39:35] um marose maybe or Vermilion he actually
[00:39:39] can use I might actually go Vermillion
[00:39:41] unironically chat listen to me listen
[00:39:45] close listen carefully Vermilion there's
[00:39:48] a chance it's your best in slot I'm not
[00:39:50] even joking look so Mari shose is the
[00:39:54] best but it's very close to Crimson
[00:39:56] witch now now the problem with Crimson
[00:39:57] Witch is the following it takes time to
[00:39:59] ramp up damage because each skill it'll
[00:40:01] ramp up but his skills are big hits of
[00:40:02] damage you only like six skills per
[00:40:03] rotation five something like that so you
[00:40:05] do lose out a lot of damage but it's
[00:40:06] still a good set it's about it's pretty
[00:40:08] similar to Magi Magi is the general best
[00:40:10] slot but it gives you 36 CR rate what
[00:40:12] else gives you crit rate his best
[00:40:14] installed weapon 27 okay that's a lot of
[00:40:16] crit rate you also start with five uh
[00:40:19] Cloud retainer gives you 10 and his C6
[00:40:21] gives you 20 so what if you have too
[00:40:24] much crit rate hm well you could go
[00:40:25] Crimson witch
[00:40:27] or very similar in strength K the dreams
[00:40:30] or very similar in strength Vermilion
[00:40:33] Hereafter yes yes now if you're a normal
[00:40:37] person and you didn't farm this then who
[00:40:39] cares but if you're me then I cares
[00:40:42] because I can actually use this I can
[00:40:44] actually use this look at how many
[00:40:46] Vermilion sets I farmed I knew this day
[00:40:48] would come I they called me crazy they
[00:40:51] said so you're [ __ ] crazy but guess
[00:40:53] what I wasn't crazy I wasn't crazy
[00:40:56] because if I was crazy would I have a
[00:40:57] perfect Vermilion 1400 flat HP by the
[00:41:00] way for my uh
[00:41:03] gaming remember
[00:41:06] me I'm going to take my lenn's build
[00:41:09] sorry Lenny nothing personal also I
[00:41:13] recorded my Shan yun's team section it
[00:41:15] was literally okay I'm they added four
[00:41:18] more team slots if you don't know there
[00:41:19] are now 14 slots for teams I swear to
[00:41:23] God I used all 14 and I literally had no
[00:41:26] like I wanted to talk about more teams
[00:41:27] there's actually that many teams for her
[00:41:29] it's
[00:41:35] stupid
[00:41:37] ratio not bad what is this Ascension
[00:41:40] stat I actually don't remember wait I
[00:41:41] have no XP bcks oh
[00:41:44] [ __ ] ATT [ __ ] [ __ ] yo what's up guys
[00:41:51] yo
[00:41:52] yo is Dragon strike real shut up don't
[00:41:55] talk to me I'm never never saying the
[00:41:56] word Dragon strike in my duuke guide I
[00:41:58] will say plunge duuke I will say [ __ ]
[00:42:00] spam your Claymore duuke I will not call
[00:42:02] it Dragon strike I think it's cringe and
[00:42:04] it it gives me the genin equivalent of
[00:42:06] PTSD because I [ __ ] hate it and
[00:42:08] playing plunge deluk without shenyun
[00:42:10] should book you not a therapy session a
[00:42:12] hospital session I don't care [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:42:14] that build [ __ ] that play style it is
[00:42:16] terrible it is not it wasn't bad but it
[00:42:17] was not fun it was disgusting with
[00:42:19] shenyun is amazing and it actually warms
[00:42:22] my heart I swear to God I swear I said
[00:42:25] when when I was playing duuke in 1.0
[00:42:28] sorry when I was playing duuke with
[00:42:29] shenyun I said holy [ __ ] this makes me
[00:42:31] feel like 1.0 duuke again it is
[00:42:33] unironically amazing but not without
[00:42:36] shenyun so we're going to talk about it
[00:42:38] as soon as I level her because of this
[00:42:40] let's level her where the what the [ __ ]
[00:42:41] is this I have no clue where anything is
[00:42:44] by the way I haven't been here so I
[00:42:45] actually don't know I don't even know
[00:42:47] the quickest way to get here but maybe
[00:42:49] mount a Kang
[00:42:53] maybe how good is she you'll see in like

[01:21:25] YouTube
[01:21:27] channel anyways let's kill this
[01:21:30] boss Alice versus oor I for shenu if you
[01:21:33] need the ER oorn if not Alis it's pretty
[01:21:35] simple they're both good like like raw
[01:21:38] numbers wise they're very similar but
[01:21:40] oorn is really good cuz you often times
[01:21:41] need a lot of ER but if you have enough
[01:21:43] ER then you can go
[01:21:45] Adas they're pretty similar though
[01:21:49] everybody hey there well that's a lot of
[01:21:52] twos
[01:21:55] HCK where did it go I flicked on him I
[01:21:58] literally you [ __ ] okay dude I flicked
[01:22:01] on
[01:22:04] him
[01:22:13] solidify coming at
[01:22:15] you
[01:22:19] [ __ ] yo yo [ __ ] this game right now
[01:22:23] I actually [ __ ] this game right
[01:22:33] now all right we have 12 mats not bad
[01:22:35] let's get the flowers okay how am we
[01:22:37] going to do this what is the best way to
[01:22:40] do this um let me do a lay line while I
[01:22:44] think there's no P point of pulling sh
[01:22:47] un if you don't have sha that's not true
[01:22:49] wait till you see the [ __ ] deluke
[01:22:50] team I actually I
[01:22:54] despise okay I'm going to say this
[01:22:56] having play even Hut having played the
[01:22:59] Luke having played duuke shenyun I
[01:23:03] genuinely despise every other type of
[01:23:05] duuke gameplay right now I'm not even
[01:23:07] joking I'll show you guys
[01:23:10] also I'm GNA say it I'm G to say it for
[01:23:14] the first time since Hut came
[01:23:19] out there is a reason to not use your C1
[01:23:22] and actually jump cancel because at
[01:23:25] c0 okay even with C1 like you're jump
[01:23:28] cancelling with shenu and I'm like you
[01:23:30] jump castle shun so if you have C1 it's
[01:23:33] kind of irrelevant but it's literally
[01:23:36] like if you have CZ Hut it it feels a
[01:23:39] lot better cuz you can actually do
[01:23:42] something with your jumps silly CH hilly
[01:23:47] CH Silly Billy hilly CH ha
[01:23:58] Reve defeat all opponents four out of 11
[01:24:02] I just I just na'vi had a Geo slime what

[01:24:07] [ __ ]
[01:24:11] Geo wait I actually need slime
[01:24:13] secretions
[01:24:17] though Chad did you know that slime was
[01:24:19] the most looked up genin term on PornHub
[01:24:21] last year it was slime and
[01:24:23] they did like the they showed the stats
[01:24:25] it was like slime and Mona yeah I don't
[01:24:27] know if together or separate but they
[01:24:29] were
[01:24:30] top anyways uh we're going to go to this
[01:24:33] uh
[01:24:36] L why do you know it was like a
[01:24:47] tweet fire IR wait does she say fire or
[01:24:51] iron I heard like
[01:24:54] iron wait that was one foule holy [ __ ]
[01:24:57] 1.0 was easy that was one foule okay um
[01:25:02] okay okay I actually need these flowers
[01:25:03] let's go let's go unlock a wayo or two
[01:25:05] so there's some next
[01:25:07] to there's all dude my pins are so bad
[01:25:10] I'm pretty sure there was a lot over
[01:25:14] here okay let me run
[01:25:21] south
[01:25:28] I have all way points fine I appreciate
[01:25:31] it okay I'll join your world wait do you
[01:25:32] mind if I take your M you oh if I join
[01:25:35] that means you don't need Cloud retainer
[01:25:37] cuz if you do then I don't want to take
[01:25:38] your mats okay so this means you're not
[01:25:40] pulling her or you'll pull her in like a
[01:25:42] week how do I do this I don't even
[01:25:44] remember okay that's not
[01:25:46] how wait I already have a world I
[01:25:48] already have World
[01:25:50] pandilla quick power of
[01:25:53] you ah pretty low crit but I that pretty
[01:25:56] good lot it
[01:26:00] yeah in you pushed as far as I can you
[01:26:07] for all this there's only one thing you
[01:26:12] should
[01:26:13] know sorry I need a claymore to break
[01:26:16] the things I mean she's a claymore but I
[01:26:19] also need Shan Yun just to flex that I
[01:26:21] have her okay it increases viewer
[01:26:24] attention if you play a character like
[01:26:25] this that's just facts by the way you
[01:26:26] can disagree on a lot of things but no
[01:26:28] one will disagree on Shen Yun so we're
[01:26:30] going to go uh oh they actually have
[01:26:32] every Waypoint holy [ __ ] this guy's
[01:26:37] speed we're going to go over
[01:26:43] here also I said you could use her emid
[01:26:45] air but technically you could only use
[01:26:46] the other two not the first one so let
[01:26:48] me write that down so I correct
[01:26:51] it uh uh also text note
[01:26:56] can can only use second or third e
[01:27:00] midair not first okay also chat I I'm
[01:27:05] going to be 100% real with you guys in
[01:27:07] case there's any like gigabrain person
[01:27:10] here I have literally no clue how to
[01:27:13] test if your this crit rate can stack
[01:27:16] against one enemy the way it's written
[01:27:17] makes it seem that you can only get 10
[01:27:19] crit rate against four enemies that is
[01:27:20] what I assume but there's like no way to
[01:27:22] test this unless you test your crit rate
[01:27:24] for like an hour straight cuz you could
[01:27:25] just be getting lucky but and I don't
[01:27:26] feel like testing for an hour straight
[01:27:28] but I'm going to assume it's for one
[01:27:29] enemy but if it's proven wrong then is
[01:27:31] then I will change my uh uh hypothesis
[01:27:34] we're going to change my glider
[01:27:42] Wings o that matches very
[01:27:45] well what about that also matches kind
[01:27:48] of that also
[01:27:50] matches no
[01:27:53] no
[01:27:55] no
[01:27:57] no no
[01:27:59] no that kind of matches as well wait
[01:28:03] this one's not bad I kind of liked uh

[01:32:16] achievement hunter right now if you

[01:32:34] this up so I can show it to you
[01:32:36] [Music]
[01:32:39] guys um contrl f
[01:32:44] [Music]
[01:32:47] commission okay so as you guys have
[01:32:50] known know I've been on my my
[01:32:51] achievement Arc okay I started with one
[01:32:53] last patch now I'm at 744 I know it's
[01:32:55] not a lot but I'll get to over a th000
[01:32:57] before font Ends don't worry anyways
[01:33:00] I've been doing uh leoa commissions
[01:33:02] every day for like a month now more than
[01:33:03] a month like two three months because
[01:33:05] I've been trying to get Cliffhanger I
[01:33:07] got Cliffhanger once I also got geot
[01:33:08] travel di twice but I need it three
[01:33:10] times I'm I'm progressing really want to
[01:33:12] go tring don't mind now in the patch
[01:33:15] notes we got dude shut the sorry sorry
[01:33:19] sorry sorry Navia sorry dude how do I
[01:33:24] sorry now in the patch notes there is
[01:33:27] this if related achievements of a
[01:33:29] commission Quest are not unlocked the
[01:33:32] probability of that commission appearing
[01:33:35] will increase so now there is a higher
[01:33:38] likelihood than you get achievement
[01:33:41] commissions if you didn't do the
[01:33:43] achievement
[01:33:45] yo that's so
[01:33:48] good like i z two years ago three three
[01:33:51] years ago doesn't care but today I'm a
[01:33:54] I'm an achievement man if I can't
[01:33:56] achieve anything in real life might as
[01:33:58] well achieve something in
[01:33:59] genin well okay I mean I'm going to be
[01:34:02] honest with you guys in 1.0 if you watch
[01:34:04] zock in 1.3 1.4 1.5 I just played Shia
[01:34:07] all the time 2.0 2.1 Shia Shia Shia
[01:34:11] people like Z why don't you get
[01:34:12] friendship on your characters I'm like
[01:34:13] dude I don't care it's just a [ __ ]
[01:34:14] name card why would I care about [ __ ]
[01:34:17] I got better things to do why would I
[01:34:18] [ __ ] care about friendship so I
[01:34:20] didn't care about friendship but now if
[01:34:22] you notice I always play new characters
[01:34:23] I play so much French of 10 French of 10
[01:34:25] French of 10 10 10 10 10 10 oh nine but
[01:34:28] we love n 10 10 10 10 10 10 right a lot
[01:34:31] of 10 why because I came to a
[01:34:34] realization I said okay well genin's
[01:34:38] been out for at the time a year maybe
[01:34:41] two and it's very in 1.0 there were
[01:34:45] rumors hey hey guys there's going to be
[01:34:47] eight player raids coming whoa eight man
[01:34:50] content guys guys guys guys you'll get
[01:34:52] aaka and then you can do a boss okay and
[01:34:55] so I was waiting for endgame I was
[01:34:56] getting so ready oh I can't wait my my
[01:34:59] my new my sha goblet which I got a 1.0
[01:35:01] by the way I got this goblet in 1.0 by
[01:35:03] the way I got this goblet like ar40
[01:35:04] anyways oh it'll be great when raids
[01:35:06] come out I now have come to terms with
[01:35:08] the fact that as fob Master put it this
[01:35:11] game has transcended the ultra casual
[01:35:13] barrier and so they will not add okay I
[01:35:17] will beg and and and and Gobble on on
[01:35:20] every anything for end game until the
[01:35:22] day I die but I've accepted since 1.4
[01:35:25] 1.5 that you know what hey the real end
[01:35:28] game is Just name card collecting which
[01:35:30] is why now you know if you look at a
[01:35:31] random character I probably have
[01:35:33] friendship on them 10 10 [ __ ] well
[01:35:35] Rizzy I like characters I like sometimes
[01:35:37] I save it because I'm going to be
[01:35:38] playing them but like 10 10 10 [ __ ]
[01:35:41] nine 10 10 10 four
[01:35:45] okay
[01:35:50] anyways
[01:35:52] yo I'm Brazilian but Fen is too fun true
[01:35:55] eating
[01:35:57] true Fen is fun I can't
[01:36:01] tell wait where am I going do a hydro
[01:36:06] build
[01:36:08] with um Can Ayo even Hydro
[01:36:14] plunge
[01:36:20] um it doesn't say plunge
[01:36:24] here but you could give me the 500
[01:36:26] gifted if you
[01:36:31] want for 500 gifted a level 90 and Crown
[01:36:35] Candace to play that
[01:36:45] team wait where are these flowers over
[01:36:50] here
[01:36:53] how much yardage she need without
[01:36:58] signature funny uh like 240 200 to
[01:37:04] 240 have
[01:37:06] fun but not with Shia and farzon by the
[01:37:09] way with Shia and C6 farzon it's around
[01:37:12] 120 to
[01:37:13] 140 um well around 140 but I'd say 120
[01:37:17] to 140 with s and no farzon I actually
[01:37:20] don't know uh I I actually don't know
[01:37:22] hopefully I find out before I release my
[01:37:24] guide I actually don't know because I
[01:37:25] only have C6 fars on um but with C6 fars
[01:37:28] on it's it's 120 to
[01:37:35] 140 okay there's like no flowers
[01:37:39] here um is that it I feel like there's
[01:37:42] probably a pin I missed did I miss this
[01:37:46] one let me go kill the
[01:37:50] enemies ain't no way it's 240
[01:37:54] okay the only thing I'm going to do is
[01:37:56] just explain very simple and basic
[01:37:59] equations to you okay look you're
[01:38:02] playing shenon in a Solo anemo team okay
[01:38:04] cuz you're not going to run another
[01:38:04] anemo character with her unless you're
[01:38:05] playing Shia if not it's useless okay so
[01:38:08] you're playing let's say duuke let's say
[01:38:10] finina let's say Bennett you using one
[01:38:14] skill and then you're swapping out of
[01:38:16] her you are getting five anemal
[01:38:18] particles from it which is a lot but
[01:38:19] then you're getting nothing else so
[01:38:21] realistically if your solo Animo 70
[01:38:23] energy cause burst your e gives you a
[01:38:25] lot after that it's all from your other
[01:38:27] characters so you're probably going to
[01:38:28] need like 200 plus if you have your
[01:38:31] signature weapon you have oor eye stuff
[01:38:33] like that you'll need a lot less but in
[01:38:36] a lot of solo ano teams you need a lot
[01:38:38] of
[01:38:44] VR com at you have you ever used razor
[01:38:47] gold I used them like 3 years ago it was

[01:41:33] a c w if you're playing aggravate you
[01:41:35] want em
[01:41:37] but well okay you attack is also fine on
[01:41:40] kaching but you want more than 20 Em
[01:41:42] usually like if you're really low em but
[01:41:44] this actually pretty good okay actually
[01:41:46] pretty good you also get more crit rate
[01:41:47] with your burst so it's higher than it
[01:41:49] looks not a bad kaching very very little
[01:41:51] em but it is what it is it's not like
[01:41:52] Vape like you don't need em but Em's
[01:41:54] about as good as attack I think yeah
[01:41:56] it's about as good attack is actually
[01:42:00] better depends who you're playing if
[01:42:01] you're playing sucros no if you're
[01:42:03] playing like I mean I think usually it's
[01:42:05] like one sub stat isn't it my account
[01:42:08] any I make some mistakes and I want to
[01:42:10] clear floor
[01:42:13] 12 am I in the world oh no I'm not

[01:42:47] with the Dragon Slayers or or or or or
[01:42:49] or that's it is that it yeah that's it
[01:42:52] wait is that it I don't know probably
[01:42:54] maybe
[01:42:58] not Skyward Atlas they said four star
[01:43:01] sorry why do I do that why can't they
[01:43:04] just be calm they said four star not
[01:43:05] five Royal
[01:43:10] okay I don't like oh I mean okay yeah
[01:43:15] you could technically use hakusan ring
[01:43:17] but I can't really think of it like you
[01:43:20] want to be on field for that weapon
[01:43:21] usually but if you're playing like Yi
[01:43:23] aggravate you kind of can swap into her
[01:43:26] kind of so eh kind of gives you er whith
[01:43:30] no I I'm I'm the biggest whith lover in
[01:43:33] the world but not for
[01:43:36] hery I'm wrongly
[01:43:49] op
[01:43:51] what where are the [ __ ]
[01:43:55] okay yeah she's not a
[01:44:08] DPS how the [ __ ] do I get here can you
[01:44:11] repeat weapons no watch my guide yeah uh
[01:44:15] I mean oor I if you have it but tldr or
[01:44:17] fat fat thrilling tals if you don't need
[01:44:19] energy and if you do just go energy act
[01:44:22] or pull for a signature weapon I think
[01:44:23] your signature is very good it's not
[01:44:26] very versatile like I wouldn't pull it
[01:44:27] for your account but for her I think
[01:44:29] it's very good it especially if you're
[01:44:30] not if you're playing a team that like
[01:44:33] it's nice for energy as well but you
[01:44:35] don't need it I don't like recommending
[01:44:36] people to pull for like a a weapon B
[01:44:39] weapon especially if it's not very
[01:44:40] versatile
[01:44:42] so it's up to
[01:44:45] you I think I want it because I'm a
[01:44:48] shate but yeah
[01:44:56] shower Cloud retainer who do I pull okay
[01:44:59] I'm going to be completely honest with
[01:45:01] you they did a thing where the best
[01:45:04] Banner for Shia is this Banner cuz you
[01:45:06] have farzon and shenyun so if you want
[01:45:09] Shia this is lowy or Banner but you
[01:45:11] can't really pull for Shia without
[01:45:13] pulling for Shia you get me so if you
[01:45:14] pull for a Shia on a not Shia Banner you
[01:45:17] won't get Shia but if you have Shia then
[01:45:19] that bannner is for you so if it's like
[01:45:20] your first sha you can wait for the Sha
[01:45:21] Banner but if you already have sha then
[01:45:22] you can pull on the not sha Banner
[01:45:24] that's good for sha which is the uh
[01:45:25] shenyun
[01:45:38] Banner cool oh there's more Jades more
[01:45:43] enemies poor shads no shads are actually
[01:45:46] winning for once cuz I feel like as much
[01:45:50] as like yeah you might not have Shia a
[01:45:52] lot of people I feel like Shia Shia's
[01:45:55] had a decent amount of runs I feel like
[01:45:56] a lot of people that love Shia have Shia
[01:45:58] and so because of that what the sh
[01:46:00] players have been [ __ ] dreading for
[01:46:01] is getting like begging for is getting a
[01:46:03] real support and C6 fars on and now
[01:46:06] there's a banner with a real support and
[01:46:07] C6 fars on and finina came out so it's
[01:46:09] like
[01:46:15] yeah I wonder how much my sh can plunge
[01:46:18] we'll check soon uh um let me go do this
[01:46:22] this maybe did I already go there I
[01:46:24] don't know I'm in a yapping competition
[01:46:26] and my opponent is z
[01:46:29] dude [ __ ] you
[01:46:32] okay is cloud Rainer relying on finina
[01:46:35] no but I actually think finina has
[01:46:36] really good Synergy with her so I do
[01:46:38] think a lot of shen yun's teams get
[01:46:39] leveled up with finina not all of them
[01:46:41] like Hut you could still do double Hydro
[01:46:43] like Hut's teams are huta yolan um Shan
[01:46:47] Yun and then or yolon or SRO sh Shen Yun
[01:46:50] and then Flex you do either Bennett you
[01:46:52] do finina or you do another Hydro I like
[01:46:54] double Hydro there but you can even do
[01:46:55] VV
[01:46:56] Vape finina for shs my shadow team Cod
[01:46:58] no you can do sha
[01:47:00] farzon uh you just do Bennett right
[01:47:02] can't you just do Bennett yeah you have
[01:47:04] two healers but who
[01:47:05] cares before finina came out her last
[01:47:09] Shia's last slot was garbage like yeah
[01:47:12] Jang Le's good yeah Bennett's good uh
[01:47:14] not Ben rightor yeah Toma C6 is good but
[01:47:16] like it didn't feel that good if you
[01:47:18] already had milth on if you R MTH on
[01:47:21] farizon it didn't feel that good to run
[01:47:22] J Le with like no set but you could just
[01:47:26] Chuck uh shenu
[01:47:29] there or finina or
[01:47:32] both I spent $250 what the wait
[01:47:37] who I missed this comment wait wait what
[01:47:40] did they
[01:47:41] say I spent $250 and got DEA Nita duuke
[01:47:46] and Cloud Rainer with C6 far on and C5 G
[01:47:48] wait that's

[01:57:27] didn't notice and I was like oh no
[01:57:29] wonder Fab is so bad on her and then

[02:11:16] five star characters I don't even know
[02:11:17] anymore Oh you mean
[02:11:19] roll roll is s75 roll I did in 1.0 when
[02:11:24] it was like pretty fast like 30 minutes
[02:11:26] for like 40 50 pulls rolling in 1.0 is
[02:11:29] sick now I don't know how good it is I
[02:11:31] think they nerfed it a lot which
[02:11:41] sucks reallying sucks right now yeah
[02:11:45] sometimes there like male events where
[02:11:46] they like give you like 1,600 and that's
[02:11:48] another 10 pull but yeah I feel like it
[02:11:50] sucks right
[02:12:00] now St Cloud
[02:12:10] convert what's up
[02:12:17] Mons
[02:12:21] worthless Chad did you know that every
[02:12:23] character did you know that all uh uh uh
[02:12:26] characters of all weapon types can Dash
[02:12:29] cancel their plunge to do it a bit
[02:12:30] faster but pole arms for some reason
[02:12:33] can't so you have to like normal cancel
[02:12:35] but it's not like actually Dash
[02:12:36] canceling like you don't see the dash
[02:12:38] you just input a dash same with the
[02:12:44] normal Z told us okay why am I pling for

[02:12:58] really relevant beforehand cuz why in
[02:13:00] the [ __ ] would you plunge on anyone
[02:13:01] that's not Shia but like I I knew for
[02:13:05] um

[02:13:58] usable she's usable shenyun is now
[02:14:01] usable can I get her 80 though please
[02:14:03] please please uh maybe I think I I
[02:14:08] should at least get her 80 for talents
[02:14:10] but her talents don't matter it's just
[02:14:11] her
[02:14:14] passive base attack matters a lot though

[02:15:16] I mentioned C6 Bennett in my shenyun
[02:15:18] video and in my gaming video it is very
[02:15:21] tempting right now cuz it's actually

[02:15:26] everything like I want to be able to
[02:15:27] play bet at Ula if I feel like it

[02:15:39] I record guys you get it but like I feel

[02:45:59] is what do you mean we I literally
[02:46:01] carried the entire [ __ ] fight till
[02:46:03] the last two seconds how is that not me

[02:46:41] stuff let's go
[02:46:44] here
[02:46:53] crafting bench we're going to go get uh
[02:46:55] convert mats that's over here which one

[02:47:19] yeah I also prearm a lot of gold
[02:47:23] mats anemo main I mean she does okay
[02:47:25] damage with C6 farzon and finina to be
[02:47:27] fair to be fair but you're just stacking
[02:47:32] attack uh the problem with leveling her
[02:47:35] weapon is that it needs new mats of an

[02:47:40] pull for a weapon right now which I want
[02:47:41] to also what's up K uh I don't know if I

[02:47:48] should do so right now also why does her
[02:47:51] glasses barely have

[02:48:47] have to uh one
[02:48:51] sec and I don't have to change my build
[02:48:53] Midstream but for Shia I will be giving
[02:48:56] her song After the
[02:48:58] stream VV is still optimal in Shia teams
[02:49:00] a lot of times because it bust finina
[02:49:02] and finina is a lot of damage but I

[02:57:58] chat here's the problem I'm not a weapon
[02:58:01] Banner William I'm not I don't condone
[02:58:04] the weapon banner I think it's a scam I
[02:58:05] do I think it's a scam save your money
[02:58:08] however this is a sh buffing
[02:58:11] weapon and genuinely
[02:58:14] here's the risk if arlino comes out if
[02:58:17] arlino is a character okay if she comes
[02:58:21] out there is a high likelihood that
[02:58:24] whatever weapon she wields is cool
[02:58:25] there's a high likelihood that fuis have
[02:58:27] cool weapons and so because of
[02:58:31] that I would like to save the five stars
[02:58:35] the the the Primo gems the weapon Banner
[02:58:37] cuz I don't weapon better very often but
[02:58:39] when I do I want it to count I want it
[02:58:40] to be worth it I got Navia cuz it's a
[02:58:42] [ __ ] axe I want want this one because
[02:58:44] it's a sh buffing
[02:58:47] weapon if our Lino has a weapon that's
[02:58:50] cool I'm going to get it the first frame

[03:04:29] years it's done Crown the
[03:04:32] Luke Crown the
[03:04:34] Luke it's done my 1.0 main the deluke
[03:04:39] main in me is coming back out oh it's
[03:04:42] all coming oh it's all coming out
[03:04:45] now Crown
[03:04:49] chat I'm going to say
[03:04:55] something going to say
[03:04:57] something I'm excited um I'm going to
[03:05:01] gear him so I managed to basically one
[03:05:04] rotate the hydro tulpa my gear wasn't
[03:05:06] relatable I did something I was like
[03:05:08] okay Hydro talpa kind of sucks balls he
[03:05:12] doesn't take Hydro damage so I put my
[03:05:13] finina on no bless and gave her no
[03:05:16] damage because it doesn't matter and
[03:05:17] then I gave my Bennett uh instructor and
[03:05:21] freedom swor and I said [ __ ] it he
[03:05:23] doesn't need a blast uh I'll give him
[03:05:25] instructor it's still it is technically
[03:05:27] optimal to go instructor I don't feel
[03:05:28] like changing my build just for that
[03:05:31] team
[03:05:32] um so I'm not going
[03:05:35] to but that is what I did for um one of
[03:05:39] my D clears so now what we're going to
[03:05:41] do is gear him uh and Hut because we're
[03:05:45] going to be playing both of them Zach
[03:05:47] chested py punch IO and it works no the
[03:05:48] [ __ ] it doesn't stop stop it doesn't
[03:05:51] work he's going to tell you it works it
[03:05:52] doesn't work no you can play any
[03:05:54] character pyro plunge okay you can pyro
[03:05:57] you can C6 Bennett finina shenu any
[03:05:59] character in the game should you maybe
[03:06:02] if you like
[03:06:03] them maybe oh yeah any sword pull arm or
[03:06:07] Claymore can be used in that
[03:06:10] team couta is a I mean AO is a hyd burst
[03:06:13] though which I mean no cool you can re
[03:06:15] your okay why is someone saying I can
[03:06:17] refine my oath sworn eye do you want me
[03:06:19] to embarrass you and myself okay fine
[03:06:22] fine fine no I can't I have one I can R
[03:06:27] to it that's it I I don't know man I
[03:06:31] don't know what happened in version 2.
[03:06:33] whatever I don't know I don't know okay
[03:06:35] but something happened I don't know what
[03:06:37] happened I don't know so don't bring it
[03:06:42] up
[03:06:45] must grief aware excessive anxiety
[03:06:52] aware it was
[03:06:55] anomia Al
[03:06:58] Al Al
[03:07:05] you okay let me make sure everyone's
[03:07:07] geared sha nice but uh shenyun gives you
[03:07:10] a lot of crit rate well up to 10 crit
[03:07:11] rate so we're this is mostly single
[03:07:13] Target so I don't think it matters cuz
[03:07:15] be around 4% crit rate for the most part
[03:07:17] so I think we can stay on the same build
[03:07:19] I removed my ER Circ though the C that
[03:07:21] had ER cuz we really don't need ER I
[03:07:23] don't think wait I have 130 what the
[03:07:25] [ __ ] why do I have 130 ER wait there
[03:07:28] might be a buff on my something just
[03:07:29] buffed me why the [ __ ] did I just gain
[03:07:32] ER okay I don't know what just gave me
[03:07:35] ER what the [ __ ] gave me ER I don't know
[03:07:39] anyways um guming is geared oh
[03:07:44] C2 yo chill uh uh ging is geared a bit
[03:07:48] low on the EM though uh you want an em s
[03:07:50] with him I actually forgot so let me
[03:07:52] give him neem
[03:07:54] sense there you go good thing I pre
[03:07:57] farmed
[03:07:59] rilon cool
[03:08:03] it I want to see if this is enough ER it
[03:08:06] might not be but there's no way to find
[03:08:08] out
[03:08:09] right I mean I'll give him a little bit
[03:08:12] more ER
[03:08:13] I don't want to give him too much though
[03:08:15] like this is way too much it might not
[03:08:17] be too much but I want to test kind of
[03:08:19] low ER you get me I'll test this ER
[03:08:22] there should be 140 yeah I mean
[03:08:25] h
[03:08:27] [ __ ] never mind we'll test under 140 see
[03:08:30] if it works uh I'm going to play huta
[03:08:33] huta is on a staff of Homer actually let
[03:08:35] me gear duuke first and then we'll do
[03:08:36] Hut so duuke is on red horn Stone
[03:08:39] thresher very good in this team you'll
[03:08:41] see why crit rate circle with some em
[03:08:43] crit damage uh pyro goblet a attack Sans
[03:08:46] em would be good as well but I don't
[03:08:47] have one uh plume with em and crit
[03:08:50] damage and a flower with em CR damage
[03:08:52] crit rate our ratio is 77 254 we also
[03:08:54] gain crit rate through Shan yun's
[03:08:56] passive and even more crit rate if we
[03:08:58] get a crit rate card in the abyss uh I
[03:09:00] could go for a little bit more crit
[03:09:02] rate which I actually think I might do I
[03:09:04] could go for this feather which gives me
[03:09:06] crit rate and E
[03:09:07] yeah that is actually worse I'm not
[03:09:09] going to overcap on crit rate it's not
[03:09:11] technically worse but we will overcap
[03:09:13] but I don't want to
[03:09:14] overcap
[03:09:16] um could go instructor Bennett
[03:09:19] honestly actually I know what I'm going
[03:09:21] to
[03:09:21] do I'm going to go this goblet this
[03:09:24] gives crit rate and EM now I have 207 em
[03:09:27] 79
[03:09:28] 226 207 em without a uh oh wait
[03:09:36] actually I love
[03:09:41] filtering
[03:09:47] 81 246 131 em Hut where's hut hut Crim
[03:09:53] Sav crimon witch okay also I noticed the
[03:09:56] only thing I don't like about shenyun
[03:09:57] with theuk and Hut is using their bursts
[03:09:59] feels like garbage like Hut's burst is
[03:10:01] still good but it's like my plunge does
[03:10:03] as much as my burst and then with
[03:10:05] duuke with du it's using my skills are
[03:10:10] such a [ __ ] waste of time I almost
[03:10:11] don't want to run on CRI I actually feel
[03:10:14] like if you don't need the ER not
[03:10:16] running Crimson Witch is probably
[03:10:17] optimal it feels so bad using your skill
[03:10:19] like you'll see when I play him it just
[03:10:21] feels like such a waste of time but it's
[03:10:23] probably still optimal maybe golden
[03:10:26] troop no wait what the [ __ ] is the set
[03:10:29] called Guild of Dreams that's it might
[03:10:31] be worth it
[03:10:34] um or Mar CH

[03:44:43] me not
[03:44:49] bad okay I don't think I need to finish
[03:44:51] it but that was pretty good that's also
[03:44:54] single Target uh to be fair chat like
[03:44:57] all of that damage so all of that
[03:45:01] damage except like except all of the
[03:45:04] damage except Cloud retainers A4 passive
[03:45:07] buff would be AOE and I guess finina
[03:45:10] isn't very like she's kind of a little
[03:45:12] ewy
[03:45:17] but [ __ ] is this team mighty be
[03:45:20] humble we'll probably do Hut after this
[03:45:23] and then gaming I
[03:45:25] think why did I put nevet
[03:45:35] here [ __ ]
[03:45:38] it
[03:45:43] certainly a team dude this team is
[03:45:51] goated it's either an Alan team or an
[03:45:54] AET team depending on how you
[03:45:59] feel has better also buff sh Shen you no
[03:46:02] it doesn't
[03:46:08] matter I mean yeah actually it does I
[03:46:12] guess wait what is the rotation do you B
[03:46:14] at first wait how do I do that
[03:46:17] team I don't know I don't want to think
[03:46:19] right now my brain is
[03:46:22] overloaded maybe it does
[03:46:26] matter
[03:46:29] cless please no I didn't get my
[03:46:33] burst it's fine I could maybe funnel
[03:46:36] that
[03:46:38] better
[03:46:47] no
[03:46:57] particles where's that EG yeah yeah yeah
[03:47:00] yeah strike let the world come I wasn't
[03:47:04] sure if it mattered if she's on field
[03:47:06] for like when she's on field but yeah
[03:47:10] I don't see why I would
[03:47:11] actually all rightless if I don't want
[03:47:14] to rotate I'm bad and should never play
[03:47:17] the game again it looks like I should
[03:47:18] never play the game again wait maybe
[03:47:21] maybe he may get to play the
[03:47:27] game nope never play the game again I
[03:47:29] mean is that close enough no I should
[03:47:32] never play the game
[03:47:33] again wait I think I can I actually
[03:47:35] think I can if I don't have sh dude they
[03:47:37] weren't like getting shredded I did like

[03:48:23] the
[03:48:25] streamt
[03:48:31] disappear this is literally best case
[03:48:33] scenario for sh give me two big enemies
[03:48:36] like that any day of the week it's over
[03:48:38] okay whatever good enough we can go uh
[03:48:40] play Hut now and
[03:48:43] ging but I like that team a lot I like
[03:48:45] sha there a
[03:48:48] lot Hut
[03:48:50] time this is going to
[03:48:56] act this is actually going to shock the
[03:48:59] world when you see my
[03:49:08] Hut pyro Shia does clear sha no oops Hut
[03:49:15] finina no what Hut
[03:49:19] yolan Cloud ret oh we're on [ __ ] okay
[03:49:23] one sec thrilling Tales does nothing in
[03:49:25] this team and we actually need a lot of
[03:49:26] er I'm going to do one Temple if we get
[03:49:28] lucky we get lucky if we don't we don't
[03:49:30] uh I would' like to see a golden light
[03:49:32] uh no we don't skip uh unfortunate all
[03:49:35] good it is what it is yes the benefits
[03:49:37] of Shia uh uh uh in this team are one a
[03:49:40] lot more single Target through A4
[03:49:42] passive but incredible AOE which is why
[03:49:44] while certain other characters may
[03:49:45] plunge more it'll be a lot smaller than
[03:49:47] AOE than sha on top of that you don't
[03:49:48] need to place Circle impact anymore and
[03:49:50] you don't need to run benett there
[03:49:51] anymore uh with that in mind we are
[03:49:53] going to uh go to our Hut no sorry go to
[03:49:55] our Cloud retainer and give her a lot
[03:49:57] more energy by giving her Skyward Atlas
[03:49:59] and then going for an energy recharge
[03:50:01] eration Sands uh I'm actually going to
[03:50:03] use artifact fast equip [ __ ] it fast
[03:50:05] equip [ __ ]
[03:50:08] it
[03:50:13] wait what if I do okay this is not
[03:50:15] feeling like a very fast equip what if I
[03:50:16] remove song of days past [ __ ] it go
[03:50:19] away please please was it a fast equip
[03:50:24] did it work it worked kind of that's
[03:50:28] actually good okay it worked it worked
[03:50:29] it worked 3K attack basically SC Alice
[03:50:31] we have I think enough ER maybe not you
[03:50:33] might need 240 in this team I want to
[03:50:34] test 200 so when I say you need 240
[03:50:36] people will believe me we'll
[03:50:38] see
[03:50:40] wait was that an attack sance or am I
[03:50:42] blind press one if I'm blind okay press
[03:50:44] one wait never
[03:50:53] mind yeah hopefully if we complain
[03:50:56] enough about the artifact the fast equip
[03:50:58] thing it actually becomes presets
[03:50:59] because right now it's has potential but
[03:51:02] isn't quite there yet isn't finina not
[03:51:05] geared don't make me look but she is
[03:51:06] geared first half we are playing
[03:51:14] h

[03:51:26] YF second
[03:51:32] half this is literally just the the
[03:51:34] [ __ ] easiest and most convenient and

[04:02:23] if you were to actually want to do this
[04:02:24] team in this Abyss you'd run like
[04:02:25] Bennett or Shang Ling but well probably
[04:02:27] Shang Ling but you get the

[04:03:41] we wanted to test so this is just a
[04:03:42] waste of time but it is what it

[04:05:12] Dam That
[04:05:17] Dope buy him a
[04:05:26] house should I like should I try hard
[04:05:29] for I think I could one rotate with the
[04:05:31] Luke but I would need to level I would
[04:05:32] need to level her and get her
[04:05:35] weapon cuz I could do
[04:05:43] no I don't have a mar sounds actually

[04:05:52] me how is he level 77 cuz zff 77 shout
[04:05:55] out shout out 77 thanks for the raid all
[04:05:59] right
[04:06:04] anyways dude I'm telling you wait till
[04:06:06] we get an abyss where Shia Feld feel
[04:06:08] good and it's going to be J cuz right
[04:06:10] now it's very single Target so there's
[04:06:11] no reason to use like AOE like sha over
[04:06:13] even like cuta or something but wait
[04:06:15] till I can plunge everything in an AOE I
[04:06:17] mean I guess technically second
[04:06:19] half should I do a second half clear
[04:06:22] with him maybe I actually
[04:06:36] could
[04:06:39] triple KY at Zio why would you type that
[04:06:43] are you guessing are you manifesting
[04:06:45] what do you know that I don't know
[04:06:50] huh yeah TR yeah it would be insane for
[04:06:52] sh but
[04:06:56] anyways cow vetan AOE okay you're going
[04:06:59] to start a war that you won't win back
[04:07:00] down while you're still ahead back down
[04:07:03] while you're still
[04:07:06] ahead
[04:07:24] wait
[04:07:27] chat what if you listen what if you NE
[04:07:31] listen I know shenu is not Hydro or
[04:07:33] dendro but what if you nuu bloom with no
[04:07:35] passives right oh n wait wait wait Neu
[04:07:39] Vape right okay nuu Candice no Neu C6
[04:07:46] Bennett or
[04:07:49] Candace now but Candace you need a good
[04:07:51] pyro off Fielder and there isn't really
[04:07:53] like you could Shang Ling but she need
[04:07:54] like a million
[04:07:55] ER okay never mind I have to I'm still
[04:08:03] cooking okay you can aaka plunge but
[04:08:05] there's a very significant problem
[04:08:08] okay let me show you why aaka punch
[04:08:11] makes you want to plunge off of a bridge
[04:08:13] also
[04:08:17] Ryden
[04:08:19] Ryden
[04:08:29] Ryden let me show you
[04:08:35] something so unless I'm if I'm wrong
[04:08:39] correct me but I'm pretty sure Ryden in
[04:08:42] her burst her charge attacks plunge
[04:08:45] plunge attacks count as burst damage and
[04:08:47] not plunge damage so for some reason so
[04:08:49] because of that Shen yun's plunge buff
[04:08:52] doesn't actually buff right in I'm
[04:08:53] pretty sure which is
[04:08:56] disgusting and DEA can't jump which is
[04:08:59] also
[04:09:01] disgusting also something that I want to
[04:09:04] show you additionally is uh let's say
[04:09:07] you're playing a sword character right
[04:09:09] shenu playing benett here's your plung
[04:09:11] speed if you just Mash space that's the
[04:09:13] plung speed well I know that the jump
[04:09:16] speed obviously I Glide but yeah but if
[04:09:18] you do something known as a dash cancel
[04:09:21] look at how much faster I can do it
[04:09:22] right way faster now let's try that Dash
[04:09:25] cancel way faster by the way with aaka h
[04:09:30] let's see if it
[04:09:34] works let's
[04:09:36] see
[04:09:38] yo I can't jump it's it's it's
[04:09:42] literally it's it's so bad I I actually
[04:09:44] hate it it's like disgusting so yeah AA
[04:09:48] you can use her but you don't want to
[04:09:50] dash cancel uh you would have to do like
[04:09:53] that and then you could like jump into
[04:09:55] like a plunge you could do like that
[04:09:56] jump plunge or
[04:09:57] something I'm sure there's a way around
[04:10:00] it if you really like aaka if anything
[04:10:02] she do the basically the exact same as
[04:10:04] Gene in that team so it would never be
[04:10:06] like useless however
[04:10:09] um you'd probably do something like jump
[04:10:13] plunge and then like Dash you you know
[04:10:17] if you want to Chong Yun you can't use
[04:10:19] Chong lethal when
[04:10:24] um thing when after the guming guide is
[04:10:27] out we will play lethal true maybe
[04:10:30] before maybe after shenyun shenyun is
[04:10:32] out tonight literally tonight I'm not
[04:10:34] going to sleep until it's okay and maybe
[04:10:35] I lied but hopefully not see you in 10
[04:10:39] years this week how do you SWR cryo
[04:10:41] optimally uh it should be the same
[04:10:43] rotation no like usually the way you
[04:10:46] swirl in a in
[04:10:48] a yeah usually what you do with AA team
[04:10:51] is
[04:10:52] um you have AA like shha let's say
[04:10:56] kokomi kazwa you'll do like you'll do ki
[04:10:59] last you have thrilling Tales but you'll
[04:11:00] do like Shena cryos swirl and then hydro
[04:11:03] and then iako it' probably be the same
[04:11:04] with the other character unless you're
[04:11:05] on thrilling tales on shenyun but
[04:11:08] you'd probably just give tell to kookomi
[04:11:09] but
[04:11:13] yeah
[04:11:15] anyways okay
[04:11:21] um dude I'm so hyped about duuke I I'm
[04:11:25] so hype about duuke chat

[04:20:57] conquering
[04:21:05] worthless Che
[04:21:09] worthless like imagine how good this
[04:21:11] [ __ ] team is if they make an abyss
[04:21:12] that's good for Shia imagine how broken
[04:21:14] Shia is if there's more than one [ __ ]
[04:21:16] enemy in the abys but no here's a boss
[04:21:18] oh we cater to yams oh yeah play hyper
[04:21:21] Bloom yeah yeah yeah yeah but imagine
[04:21:23] multiple enemies like that that actually
[04:21:24] spawn together it's over Shia best best
[04:21:26] character in the game not even close
[04:21:27] okay it is close he's actually not the
[04:21:29] best but he would be very good
[04:21:30] incredibly good he is good right now but
[04:21:32] just saying imagine Abyss rotations
[04:21:33] where there's a lot of enemies three
[04:21:34] maleni for example oh my my God anyways
[04:21:37] uh we're going to get this boom uh stun

[04:22:46] two Electro dudes okay I haven't done
[04:22:48] this floor with SH in a while or at
[04:22:50] least optimally I think they dashed you

[04:22:53] Dash to me and then I spawn next to the
[04:22:55] you're coming was for told or whatever
[04:22:57] the [ __ ] they say and I kill
[04:22:59] them
[04:23:02] yeah I think this is optimal I'm not
[04:23:04] even going to e on cloud retainer cuz I
[04:23:06] don't need that energy cuz it's going to
[04:23:06] be one rotation

[04:23:38] curtain like imagine if this was every
[04:23:41] Abyss anyways
[04:23:47] cool okay ging finally [ __ ] four
[04:23:50] hours in the Stream to be fair though I
[04:23:53] like finished my shenyun guide
[04:23:54] completely I haven't really looked into
[04:23:55] gumming other than how to build him I
[04:23:57] haven't played him much so we we'll do
[04:23:58] that uh with regards to shenyun is there
[04:24:02] anything I learned today that I want to
[04:24:03] add to the
[04:24:05] guide um I should probably mention that
[04:24:07] this passive talent doesn't factor in
[04:24:09] any like attack Buffs and it's just her
[04:24:11] like attack
[04:24:26] um anyways C Ben makes any character
[04:24:30] viable I already said that
[04:24:32] yeah oh we're on Atlas I was not on
[04:24:35] thrilling Tales okay so Shia could have
[04:24:37] been I think our Shia is about
[04:24:39] 20 no not 20 I want to say I know
[04:24:42] upgrading to signatures about a 10% DPS
[04:24:44] increase but I want to say 20% once we
[04:24:46] actually like level her even song of
[04:24:48] days past cuz fina's damage is like yeah
[04:24:50] technically worth maxing but I don't
[04:24:52] care cuz it's Chow so we could probably
[04:24:54] make him his plunge like 10 to 20%
[04:24:57] higher um but yeah so we'll probably do
[04:25:01] that
[04:25:03] anyways Mr ging time
[04:25:06] let's go do a um should I just send it
[04:25:09] in the abyss I mean I
[04:25:20] can chat I'm going to create I'm going
[04:25:23] to concoct two ging teams and you will
[04:25:26] tell me which one to
[04:25:29] play I haven't played
[04:25:35] either
[04:25:44] where's Bennett dude there's so many
[04:25:46] [ __ ] characters in the game it's
[04:25:47] actually hard for me to like remember
[04:25:49] where I should level 90 everyone I
[04:25:51] actually really should do
[04:25:56] that make sure to keep
[04:26:05] up
[04:26:12] we can either play melt gumming or vape
[04:26:17] Vape gumming this will be Bennett at the
[04:26:19] end or maybe double Hydro I think Vape
[04:26:20] is better I mean I think Bennett is
[04:26:22] better you you want me on your
[04:26:28] team I like melt the problem is I don't
[04:26:31] know how to do this rotation properly
[04:26:33] it'll take a little bit of practice cuz
[04:26:35] I haven't played play ging yet at all um
[04:26:38] but I know the team's good the only
[04:26:41] thing is I don't know if I can use Shan
[04:26:43] Yun here cuz I feel like I won't have
[04:26:44] enough cryo right cuz you can't cryo
[04:26:47] swirl like you want
[04:26:48] kazwa
[04:26:52] um TC said melt better no there's no TC
[04:26:55] that would just say that if they did
[04:26:56] then everything depends if you're a tcer
[04:26:58] your ansers it depends I've spoken with
[04:27:01] many many ters it's it depends that's
[04:27:04] the answer if you're just like yeah this
[04:27:06] team's better that it's very rare well
[04:27:08] sometimes teams are just bad sometimes
[04:27:09] teams are just good but like when two
[04:27:11] builds are very viable it it's it
[04:27:13] depends it it depends it always depends
[04:27:16] but yes um yes I do think okay I think
[04:27:20] in comparison with basically every other
[04:27:23] pyro character melt is a lot better with
[04:27:26] gumming which is really cool because
[04:27:29] like yeah you could do this with duuke
[04:27:30] but he doesn't apply that much like he
[04:27:32] doesn't hit that often he does like this
[04:27:35] sorry pal
[04:27:37] pyro hit and then you wait till you
[04:27:38] catch your thing again then you do it
[04:27:39] again and it's like you're not like
[04:27:40] spamming pyro so you can actually kind
[04:27:42] of melt now I need to practice this team
[04:27:44] a little I did gear my Rosaria though
[04:27:46] she's geared with the catch or
[04:27:48] Deathmatch um Kazo is also geared 10,000
[04:27:51] em
[04:27:52] um
[04:27:56] but
[04:27:58] yeah I need to make sure it works so
[04:28:00] we're going to play Mr
[04:28:03] G Big G top G okay I'm sor sorry we're
[04:28:06] going to play gaming with h
[04:28:10] finina Rosaria am I supposed to use no
[04:28:13] no not Rosaria
[04:28:16] Bennett uh
[04:28:22] Rosaria
[04:28:33] Kaza who should second off
[04:28:38] oh yeah I don't need shenyun here wait I
[04:28:40] can still play shenyun in second half
[04:28:41] wait I can literally play the same shout
[04:28:42] team wait I could have done this last
[04:28:43] half I could have literally played the
[04:28:45] sh half I did with
[04:28:46] ging In the Arms of an Angel oh I can't
[04:28:50] play this against thunder man if [ __ ] I
[04:28:52] wanted to play this shenu
[04:28:57] team
[04:29:01] um what's another shenu team I could
[04:29:04] play I mean a tactic Al rly but I don't
[04:29:06] really want
[04:29:09] to I mean I could just hoow
[04:29:20] again
[04:29:22] Charlotte
[04:29:27] Charlotte who am I looking for who
[04:29:34] tell dude is there's no way Ula plunges
[04:29:38] a real team why would you do that you're
[04:29:40] like why are you running an an Emo
[04:29:42] character there it doesn't swirl [ __ ]
[04:29:43] you could swirl like you're Electro
[04:29:48] but
[04:29:54] why vapula
[04:29:59] okay you can swirl physical oh true okay
[04:30:05] I need to figure out to set this
[04:30:06] up is it just
[04:30:13] like or I could Ben it first no I could
[04:30:16] Ben it first I benett alt benett alt
[04:30:19] then Rosaria then kazua no Rosaria then
[04:30:23] benad Al then it doesn't remove the cry
[04:30:25] Ora but then I kazos maybe it's going to
[04:30:27] be one of the two first it's either
[04:30:28] benett first or Rosaria first I don't
[04:30:29] know if I have time to snapshot Rosaria
[04:30:31] with Bennett I think Rosaria if my
[04:30:33] guming c z she might be doing similar
[04:30:35] damage low key so it might be worth
[04:30:37] we're going to try
[04:30:40] it yeah and then that cryos and pyros
[04:30:44] and then I do wait no no no no I don't
[04:30:47] want to infuse it with P I want Infuse
[04:30:48] it with cryo I forgot never mind let me
[04:30:50] run it back sorry I haven't played this
[04:30:51] team yet okay wait so I don't want to B
[04:30:53] at Al which me I
[04:30:56] probably like that you teamw is

[04:31:26] okay
[04:31:26] so I'm just going to Rosario Al [ __ ]

[04:38:34] I didn't play him yet yeah so I like I
[04:38:36] didn't go through his talents yet
[04:38:37] actually I did go through his talents I
[04:38:39] I just forgot
[04:38:42] that need YULA to fix what do you mean
[04:38:45] need
[04:38:49] YULA no I
[04:38:55] skilled let's just pretend that didn't
[04:38:57] happen
[04:38:58] Jud the bird teamw is okay okay you
[04:39:04] can't run okay mighty myal
[04:39:06] be where's the dog there he
[04:39:14] is I did not spell
[04:39:19] power oh yeah let me play a arena team I
[04:39:21] think it'll be better is fourar good
[04:39:24] yeah but you he's a lot better with like
[04:39:26] certain
[04:39:28] stuff I didn't SW power there but he can
[04:39:30] like yeah he can do quite a bit that
[04:39:33] team has low d damage outside of him
[04:39:36] whereas if I play him with some other
[04:39:37] characters that do damage then it might
[04:39:40] be better team
[04:39:41] wise like
[04:39:48] um I mean I could do fin
[04:39:53] shun I wonder if double Hydro is the
[04:39:56] play cuz you can weave in a normal
[04:39:57] attack like you can there's nothing
[04:39:59] stopping you you just don't get a pyro
[04:40:03] swirl Chev fish Bennett that might
[04:40:05] actually work
[04:40:11] too you could also I mean I could also
[04:40:13] just Kazo I don't know if this is enough
[04:40:15] surely this is enough
[04:40:18] Hydro I just don't pyro Infuse
[04:40:33] Kazo
[04:40:49] uh this seems annoying this seems really
[04:40:51] annoying I'm going to try it very
[04:40:56] fast I mean swirling pyro is just EQ
[04:41:00] Bennett QE and then so coo so I've tried
[04:41:03] this I've reset for like hours straight
[04:41:05] on 200 ping it did not work like
[04:41:07] literally in an hour I got it once on
[04:41:09] 200 ping but on 20 ping it's pretty easy
[04:41:11] but I just don't know if I'm trying to
[04:41:13] if I Kaza burst I don't think I can get
[04:41:14] it like if I do
[04:41:16] this and then kazwa I don't think I can
[04:41:18] get pyro wind everybody stand back
[04:41:22] actually maybe I could have wait let me
[04:41:25] try thanks for flying away dumb enemy

[04:57:13] choose a weapon I like Crane's echoing
[04:57:16] call if you are a plunge gamer like I am
[04:57:19] because it is very nice for shenyun but
[04:57:21] it's not that versatile n's weapon also

[06:02:21] farzon and there's Cloud retainer and
[06:02:23] ging's decent as a fourar DPS is pretty
[06:02:25] good but I'll make a video on him later
[06:02:28] uh it's up to you though like if like
[06:02:30] your sh team's already good and you want
[06:02:31] to build like another five star
[06:02:33] character you're waiting for like maybe
[06:02:35] you want Nita or some [ __ ] like Nita's
[06:02:37] higher pull value obviously but like it
[06:02:39] depends but I do think this is a really
[06:02:40] good Banner for Shia because if you
[06:02:42] already have them because Cloud retainer
[06:02:43] and farzon right whereas the other ways
[06:02:45] to get farzon as a Shia main is like
[06:02:48] Scara
[06:02:55] usually she retaining on my cloud till I
[06:03:00] lament I am very close to Banning
[06:03:15] you time to
[06:03:20] shine where's my e okay
[06:03:23] whatever L
[06:03:26] Lament
[06:03:30] wait can I hit 200 200 200 please
[06:03:38] please where did I go
[06:03:50] wrong Envy hit
[06:03:53] 200 why are you guys saying deluke
[06:03:55] better like I don't also love Luke I
[06:03:57] don't if the Luke is being used as a a
[06:04:00] good character comparison I'm happy this
[06:04:02] isn't like an L for me if the Luke is
[06:04:04] good also he has the highest plunge
[06:04:06] [ __ ] scaling and it can vaporize and
[06:04:08] Shen's buff not Shena [ __ ] anemo
[06:04:10] Shen's buff can Vape as well well like
[06:04:12] cuz it's it works like a quill so it
[06:04:14] gets added and then multiplied but yeah
[06:04:15] so it's a good thing but also Shia's AOE
[06:04:18] is way way bigger so in AOE situations
[06:04:19] he'd be a lot better but it's
[06:04:26] okay
[06:04:28] uh
[06:04:34] this make
[06:04:36] way evil
[06:04:39] conquering
[06:04:40] worthless why am I [ __ ] cryo
[06:04:42] Afflicted please 200
[06:04:45] please oh 200 okay cool I know this
[06:04:47] domain Buffs you a little but still
[06:04:50] nice what's your highest sh plung like
[06:04:52] 490 or something but that was in a
[06:04:54] bounty like 480 460 it was a bounty so
[06:04:57] it's like kind of cheating I'm going to
[06:04:58] use a fragile cuz I don't know I'm
[06:05:05] board
[06:05:13] okay when you think about plunge AA I
[06:05:16] talked about it earlier Dash cancelling
[06:05:17] on AA legit does not work you could do
[06:05:19] something like charge attack jump cancel
[06:05:21] it plunge but I don't think it's the
[06:05:24] optimal way to play AA you can though
[06:05:26] and in at worst she's basically a gene
[06:05:28] in your freeze team like that's that's
[06:05:30] basically the thing with shenyun also is
[06:05:32] like at worst she's just Jee and Jean's
[06:05:35] not a bad character right so like I
[06:05:38] really don't think she's like only made
[06:05:40] for like one or two te I think she can
[06:05:42] genuinely be pretty flexible uh but
[06:05:44] usually she's nice if your character can
[06:05:45] weave in plunges what characters can use
[06:05:47] plunges well one three types either one
[06:05:50] they're designed around plunges like
[06:05:51] shower guming two they have elemental
[06:05:53] infusions like du couta or a catalyst or
[06:05:56] three which usually is tied with two if
[06:05:59] they have that infusion but also they
[06:06:01] like to jump so they can jump cancel
[06:06:03] something like CAU rizzly whatever like
[06:06:05] even Yi if you can jump cancel something
[06:06:08] or weaving a punch then that is when
[06:06:10] like Shan Yun gets a lot
[06:06:14] better but yeah but also like at in a
[06:06:18] lot of teams you could just use her as a
[06:06:19] [ __ ] enemo support and like anemo
[06:06:21] healer is fine her healing is comparable
[06:06:23] to Jean but jean is more front-loaded
[06:06:25] healing more burst healing should un is
[06:06:27] more over
[06:06:42] time her attacks also have surprisingly
[06:06:44] long range which is pretty
[06:06:51] cool meanwhile
[06:06:55] BYU
[06:06:59] very premium sh team yes it
[06:07:13] is but to be fair shenu and farzon are
[06:07:18] from the current banner and then if you
[06:07:19] don't have F Well one finina is amazing
[06:07:21] for your account in general but if you
[06:07:22] don't have her you can just use Bennett
[06:07:24] so it's not a big deal but yeah like CX
[06:07:27] faron's hard to
[06:07:33] get wait let me try in the Vermilion
[06:07:35] domain I probably can't hit 200k there
[06:07:37] but we'll
[06:07:40] see does Jong Le work yeah but not over
[06:07:44] Bennett I benching Bennett for Jang Lee
[06:07:47] feels really
[06:07:49] [Music]
[06:07:55] dumb
[06:08:05] all right let's do
[06:08:06] this Arena
[06:08:13] Bo
[06:08:15] the
[06:08:18] disappear
[06:08:20] wait I'm doing no
[06:08:22] damage oh the thing is it's a single
[06:08:25] Target buff I actually might have it
[06:08:26] might have buff the other
[06:08:27] I forgot yeah that was
[06:08:36] 170 unlucky unlucky could have been a
[06:08:40] good uh Echo
[06:08:50] set have fun with
[06:08:53] this St Cloud conver
[06:09:01] yeah notice how the damage numbers are
[06:09:03] different cuz chenyun only her her quill
[06:09:05] Buffs one oh 1 186 her quill Buffs one
[06:09:08] target so it's like
[06:09:12] yeah does that a
[06:09:24] lot dude why are you spam asking if
[06:09:27] ging's better than CLE it stop seek
[06:09:36] help but
[06:09:40] probably doesn't really matter
[06:09:44] though like with C6 is c0
[06:09:55] probably but if you're playing mono pyro
[06:09:58] gaming you're kind of like griefing your
[06:09:59] entire
[06:10:00] life so
[06:10:14] like although I say that but
[06:10:17] realistically realistically if you're
[06:10:19] playing Bennett kazua Shang Ling that's
[06:10:22] probably already a good team so gaming
[06:10:23] would probably feel fine there I just
[06:10:25] wouldn't recommend over like [ __ ]
[06:10:28] Vape but I'm sure the team still does
[06:10:30] really
[06:10:32] well today is my birthday so got some
[06:10:35] money happy birthday I do think the CH
[06:10:37] teams have some potential though I have
[06:10:39] to try them more I haven't looked into
[06:10:40] ging as
[06:10:42] much I'll test them a bit more off
[06:10:44] stream tomorrow maybe on stream as
[06:10:48] well should I end I don't really want to
[06:10:50] but it's been 6 hours and I should
[06:10:52] probably upload my
[06:10:55] guide
[06:10:58] happy birthday though uh bugs
[06:11:03] buddy unfortunately you did not include
[06:11:06] your uid in the message so I cannot do

[06:11:47] shenyun guide and then look into gaming
[06:11:48] a bit more so then next stream we'll
[06:11:50] probably be more guming

[06:11:57] very happy sha wise very happy duuk wise
[06:12:00] and very happy Hut wise I will
[06:12:04] say next stream will either be tomorrow
[06:12:07] or Abyss reset Abyss reset is in two
[06:12:10] days I know it says one day so
[06:12:11] technically tomorrow it's 24 hours but
[06:12:13] it's like past midnight for me so
[06:12:15] tomorrow isn't tomorrow even though
[06:12:16] tomorrow is tomorrow you get the point
[06:12:18] uh okay unlucky I'm not I can't swap
[06:12:21] servers I mean I could actually anyways
[06:12:24] so it'll either be tomorrow if I have
