[00:30:16] spent 6 months fing for 664
[00:30:20] m99 I don't want to do this because it
[00:30:23] will make other people throw bits at me

[00:30:41] the [ __ ]
[00:30:43] wait two main both Wanderer and Shia and
[00:30:46] all to get is being called worthless in
[00:30:49] every language Chad it's the it's the
[00:30:51] guy that it's the it's the guy that was
[00:30:52] used in dman videos or one dman video I
[00:30:55] don't know if it's I don't know who this

[00:31:10] um what was your U ID boom boom Neil
[00:31:13] sest anemo M um Neil no disrespect man
[00:31:17] I'm glad you just got your Shia you have
[00:31:19] Scara you're an anemo player like me uh
[00:31:22] just saying you look you make us look
[00:31:24] bad if your bio is satus anemo Main and
[00:31:26] you're only in a this 11 it just makes
[00:31:28] us look a little bad uh but it's
[00:31:32] fine that attack is concerningly low you
[00:31:34] better have a [ __ ] death match
[00:31:37] on it's fine it's actually okay because
[00:31:40] if you have like shenyun or Bennett
[00:31:42] right
[00:31:45] um okay your attack is very low cuz
[00:31:47] under million I don't know what the
[00:31:49] circumstances are it is low attack
[00:31:51] that's just something I'm I'm pointing
[00:31:52] out uh that's fine though let's look at
[00:31:53] your build no it's okay it's okay it's a
[00:31:55] work in progress that's pretty decent
[00:31:57] for an offset oh 35 I thought that was
[00:31:59] 25 what the okay that's very good I
[00:32:02] thought that was 25 that was very
[00:32:06] good that's very good uh how the [ __ ] is
[00:32:10] are you on like a ER
[00:32:22] set do you think this is a
[00:32:25] joke do you think this is a game if your
[00:32:28] jly on fav oh my God that's why that's
[00:32:31] [ __ ] why please please purchase a
[00:32:33] favonius lance
[00:32:37] I please you also have C1 you don't even
[00:32:41] need let me look at your
[00:32:44] goblet this is it's
[00:32:47] okay this is not great but it it's
[00:32:51] fine ungrateful
[00:32:54] streamer ungrateful you don't need ER SS
[00:32:58] on TR you don't I don't care if
[00:33:02] you okay this isn't even bad by the way
[00:33:05] but please like please go attack s
[00:33:08] please I think it would be a good
[00:33:09] addition to your store purchase a Fa l
[00:33:11] as if it's that easy they have C1 cha I
[00:33:14] okay I don't know their account however
[00:33:16] you probably have an R1 fast if you
[00:33:18] don't that's okay don't go fast if you
[00:33:19] don't I would argue that a fav character
[00:33:23] I would argue that running a dog
[00:33:24] character in a sh team just because you
[00:33:26] have a fav weapon of that weapon type is
[00:33:28] better than going in ER s that might not
[00:33:30] be mathematically true but it feels true
[00:33:32] so I'm going to say it like it's true
[00:33:34] please you don't need okay but
[00:33:36] regardless you have C1 you're probably
[00:33:38] running an anemo battery either sucros
[00:33:41] or farizon or both right or
[00:33:44] shenu you probably don't need any rans
[00:33:47] you probably need either zero in his
[00:33:49] best team or 120 maybe 140 if you need
[00:33:53] 170 then this build or 160 can happen
[00:33:57] happen but like if it does just play
[00:34:01] Shang Ling like if if your shower
[00:34:03] rotation makes you need 160 ER you might
[00:34:06] want you might want to invest in
[00:34:07] changling I'm sorry I'm just going to
[00:34:08] say it um
[00:34:11] now real now I'm not stupid I know that
[00:34:14] this person probably wants an attack
[00:34:15] sand probably doesn't have it yet so for
[00:34:17] that I say hey keep grinding you'll get
[00:34:18] it
[00:34:19] soon best of luck to you you can use
[00:34:21] this as a off Feast for like Ryden or or
[00:34:24] someone else however as it
[00:34:27] stands um You probably have a Vermilion
[00:34:30] flower like yes this flower is really
[00:34:32] good but like flowers are usually the
[00:34:33] easiest piece now I say that having a
[00:34:35] dog [ __ ] flower myself uh it probably if
[00:34:39] you have a decent flower you just go
[00:34:40] flower and then offset Sands uh do you
[00:34:42] have a good offset s let's
[00:34:50] check what is happening okay good sh
[00:34:53] though good show good show though good
[00:34:55] sh Triple Crown I respect it uh double
[00:34:57] triple crown and then 181 so far you
[00:35:00] know good account like good good good
[00:35:02] good it's good no disrespect there it's
[00:35:04] good but please give your shout attack
[00:35:06] sense if you can that's
[00:35:08] all oh my God he said

[00:35:55] look Jong Lee is good with
[00:36:01] him
[00:36:03] um okay unironically F okay why is he on
[00:36:07] Aquila okay wait a
[00:36:13] second I don't recommend Kaza with Shia
[00:36:16] generally but uh before the finina and
[00:36:20] shenyun like before they came out one of
[00:36:22] my favorite probably my favorite Shia
[00:36:23] team was Shia farzon Bennett and then
[00:36:27] full crit Kaza because he actually does
[00:36:29] so much damage here because of farzon
[00:36:31] and because of Bennett now I still
[00:36:32] recommend using Kazo in your other team
[00:36:34] but if you want to play them together
[00:36:35] this is something you can do uh Jong Le
[00:36:37] can also work but yeah I don't know
[00:36:43] anyways uh what was I talking about oh
[00:36:47] yeah do you know you are in the DAR man

[00:38:41] up chat chat chat okay this might be a
[00:38:43] paid actor I mean it might literally be
[00:38:45] a paid actor because they were in the
[00:38:46] Dand video however this could mean one
[00:38:50] of two things the most likely outcome is
[00:38:52] that it's just that account used in the
[00:38:54] video and hey they all watch my stream
[00:38:57] or my videos option two is that this is
[00:39:00] literally
[00:39:02] Darman and they know me now I know
[00:39:05] that's a lot less likely
[00:39:10] but I knew this now quote me on this by
[00:39:14] the way I knew this from The Moment I
[00:39:16] Saw C3 R in on full Elemental Mastery I
[00:39:18] knew

[00:40:21] sec chat we are at floor 9 sorry we at
[00:40:24] floor 10 uh cuz I didn't do this Abyss
[00:40:26] rotation so um you know we're going to
[00:40:29] have to cleam it or do it
[00:40:44] all please teach us to kill wut with
[00:40:46] ganu I'm
[00:40:49] begging
[00:40:55] um
[00:40:56] there is no chance they aren't a paid
[00:40:58] chatter
[00:41:01] sure where's the where the [ __ ] is the
[00:41:03] we
[00:41:08] not I try
[00:41:25] you
[00:41:30] so You' probably want to run
[00:41:33] G when OverWatch 2
[00:41:36] streaming need
[00:41:39] help
[00:41:41] what why you asking me to stream
[00:41:45] OverWatch what you r r g g with you
[00:41:47] could probably do ganu with uh kazua no
[00:41:51] maybe G Nita like burnmouth or something
[00:41:53] you do G
[00:41:54] Nita um
[00:42:07] Gita you probably want like Yan cie
[00:42:10] don't tell me they did it
[00:42:12] again let me show you how to play this
[00:42:17] team so you're going to want to charge
[00:42:19] on G you then very quickly burst you can
[00:42:21] Dash chel if you want to press your e
[00:42:23] swap the Nita apply the mark go Yan
[00:42:26] ideally you have your burst back I don't
[00:42:28] then you cie E Auto attack
[00:42:33] temp as you can see you can swap to your
[00:42:36] ganu and she will be doing everything
[00:42:38] here so this is a g team this is why
[00:42:40] well right now he's just running around
[00:42:41] everywhere so uh don't mind me but this
[00:42:44] is uh yeah one of G strongest
[00:42:46] teams
[00:42:50] yep wow Z you're clearing so fast and
[00:42:53] then you can use G you can charge out
[00:42:54] these things Bo boom wa that's so cool I
[00:42:58] love G you
[00:43:01] yep you lawn burst
[00:43:04] again there you
[00:43:06] go nice G you
[00:43:18] clear uh if you do really want to play G
[00:43:21] though I would recommend a melt team cuz
[00:43:22] you can't freeze the we nut you do G bet
[00:43:24] it Shang Ling and then another
[00:43:26] uh if you play burn melt you're cringe
[00:43:28] if you play uh kazwa instead of Shang
[00:43:30] ling you're double cringe so I would
[00:43:32] recommend G Bennett Shang Ling and then
[00:43:33] a cry maybe uh and then you just uh pop
[00:43:36] the thing with G to reduce the crry res
[00:43:38] and then you
[00:43:42] melt all
[00:43:46] right uh it's the same Abyss right so
[00:43:48] there's nothing new yeah all right let's
[00:43:50] just go

[01:21:19] actually play soo soo Nita I don't know
[01:21:22] if I like no Nita's good here yeah son
[01:21:29] Nita um I I we need a bow character
[01:21:33] right so there's like no choice in teams
[01:21:35] like you need a bow against the Aon
[01:21:37] blight so I kind of can't unless I go
[01:21:39] like fishal and then no hyper blo and
[01:21:41] just
[01:21:42] aggravate uh which I'm not
[01:21:45] really advocating
[01:21:50] for but we have to do a lot of clears
[01:21:52] today so we're going to be doing a lot
[01:21:53] of
[01:21:57] teams in this team I usually go sh Le uh
[01:22:01] but I kind of don't like this team that
[01:22:04] much also yeah official's a little cope
[01:22:06] against the we
[01:22:08] nut I do think we just play yon
[01:22:10] whatevers whatever but Soo woo
[01:22:13] Soo not
[01:22:21] bened in before he makes Soo look bad
[01:22:24] Smo backslash listen here [ __ ]
[01:22:27] my Soo is one of the best in the lands
[01:22:29] okay and you better put some respect on
[01:22:31] his [ __ ] name we're going to
[01:22:33] watch this clear you're going to see my
[01:22:34] Soo and my Shia destroying everything
[01:22:36] let me start the recording cuz I need
[01:22:37] background footage for my Shia video um
[01:22:39] the sh video by the way in case you're
[01:22:41] wondering is going to be a it's a mix
[01:22:44] between a review and a guy it's probably
[01:22:45] going to be pretty long first has going
[01:22:46] to be reviewing why he's good now what
[01:22:48] changed and also talking about the pros
[01:22:50] and cons so I'm going be talking about
[01:22:51] the good stuff but but I'm also going to
[01:22:52] be like hey it's also expensive right C6
[01:22:54] fars on why is it good why is it
[01:22:56] expensive finina shun right explaining
[01:22:59] what changed the new sets all that then
[01:23:00] going into build of of of his artifacts
[01:23:03] weapons teams
[01:23:05] constellations the only thing we're not
[01:23:06] going to be including is like how is
[01:23:07] abilities work because if you need to
[01:23:09] know that then watch my last sh video
[01:23:11] true I already recorded all of it the
[01:23:13] only thing I'm not sure is I don't even
[01:23:15] know if it's like too negative
[01:23:17] like like this even is like really
[01:23:19] [ __ ] good but I spend like five to
[01:23:21] like1 15 minutes talking about how
[01:23:24] annoying it can be to get C6 fars on and
[01:23:27] like sort some like expensiveness
[01:23:29] elements but you can also just run
[01:23:32] Bennett instead of either finina or
[01:23:34] shenyun and it's typically a 20 to 40%
[01:23:37] well it is a pretty big
[01:23:39] boss but
[01:23:51] anyways um
[01:24:02] um
[01:24:13] [Applause]
[01:24:21] uh
[01:24:29] okay sorry I was messaging Ian just for
[01:24:32] some uh video stuff all right
[01:24:35] ready what's your wpm I don't know I'm
[01:24:37] always bad in those tests cuz like I fat
[01:24:40] finger things so I'm not as accurate
[01:24:42] like I type fast but my accuracy is kind
[01:24:43] of [ __ ] also I change keyboards a lot I
[01:24:46] used to use the sh keyboard now I'm
[01:24:47] using the like the wooting which I hate
[01:24:50] but it's really it's like cheating and
[01:24:51] valerant so I use it
[01:24:53] like I don't like small like I don't
[01:24:54] like 60% keyboards but I use it
[01:24:56] cuz like I like it but like I don't like
[01:24:59] it does that make

[02:44:07] pressing watch this four star never
[02:44:12] mind Skyward Skyward
[02:44:19] chat I have 71 fragiles we're actually
[02:44:22] going to use them soon I might wait for
[02:44:24] like oh oh oh chlorin oh arlino oh so
[02:44:27] but but I don't know we we have a lot
[02:44:29] I've been saving them I don't know for
[02:44:30] who but uh I think it will be Banger
[02:44:33] content whenever we use it I might use a
[02:44:35] few un million I think it would be funny
[02:44:37] uh but I'm not sure
[02:44:39] yet um what else is
[02:44:44] there
[02:44:45] wait how many artifacts do I have I just
[02:44:47] want to see how many like strong if I
[02:44:48] have enough to strong box when slice is
[02:44:50] here uh so he said we need to
[02:44:55] do I think we're doing a like we want
[02:44:58] 500
[02:45:00] artifacts is what he said let me check
[02:45:02] his my DMs what did he say he
[02:45:11] said ah he
[02:45:14] said
[02:45:19] 390 10 rounds of 39 so I need 390 so
[02:45:23] this is 39 uh each row is six so without
[02:45:27] these this is
[02:45:29] 36 uh so we'll do 36 plus well we'll
[02:45:32] just count six rows I guess so 6 7 8 9
[02:45:34] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
[02:45:39] 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
[02:45:44] 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
[02:45:49] 49 and then I could unlock let's say
[02:45:52] another three rows let's say like 50
[02:45:54] let's say 55 I'm being generous uh let's
[02:45:57] let's do 55 * 6 that is
[02:46:01] 330 he's said
[02:46:06] 390 okay we still need more
[02:46:12] artifacts oh but actually that's not
[02:46:14] true cuz when you strong box you get
[02:46:16] like onethird of it back right so we can
[02:46:18] just like recycle them so surely it's
[02:46:20] not that big of a deal like surely it's
[02:46:21] enough cuz we can recycle from the ones
[02:46:23] we get unless we're checking them all at
[02:46:24] once I don't know if that's what he
[02:46:25] wants but I don't think so so it should
[02:46:26] be
[02:46:28] fine it should be
[02:46:31] fine also I think we're both supposed to
[02:46:34] do emblem but I lowkey want to do
[02:46:35] Vermilion so I don't know what's going
[02:46:36] to
[02:46:44] happen
[02:47:00] nobody tell nobody tell him I didn't
[02:47:02] actually I didn't actually let's go do a
[02:47:03] moral line cuz I'm a responsible I'm
[02:47:05] responsible with my resin let's do a
[02:47:06] moral line whoa Z's doing a moral line
[02:47:10] what that's awesome man you'd have more
[02:47:12] MOA if you [ __ ] explored inauma shut
[02:47:14] up [ __ ] you sorry why am I so mean
[02:47:23] Today evil conquering
[02:47:26] worthless
[02:47:37] worthless you get more off from
[02:47:39] Vermilion that is true actually so think
[02:47:41] about okay from an efficiency
[02:47:43] perspective right you get get MOA from
[02:47:45] artifact domains but you don't get
[02:47:47] artifacts from MOA domains if you do a
[02:47:50] MOA L line you're not getting a
[02:47:51] Vermilion piece but if you do a
[02:47:53] Vermillion run you get some morea so
[02:47:56] object like like like like objectively
[02:47:58] speaking one of the two is more
[02:47:59] efficient than the other I'm going to
[02:48:02] use one
[02:48:10] FR wa one fragile for the boys okay one
[02:48:13] fragile for the boys one fragile for the
[02:48:24] boys nobody say
[02:48:26] anything this could be
[02:48:32] good yeah I promise I'm done W I'm done
[02:48:34] I promise okay we're done we're done
[02:48:36] we're
[02:48:37] done I dashed away I can't even get it
[02:48:39] if I want to
[02:48:41] okay uh let me level what we got there
[02:48:44] might be something something good in
[02:48:46] here I am many
[02:48:49] things but an artifact coper I am not

[03:07:50] um wait a second why am I recommended is
[03:07:53] there Professor Z teaches me a lesson
[03:07:55] and it's me and the [ __ ] Gene cosplay
[03:07:57] what is
[03:07:58] this uh second second half we're going
[03:08:00] to play oh [ __ ] I forgot the atrocity we
[03:08:03] had second half what if we play okay
[03:08:05] we'll play Quicken we'll do y official
[03:08:07] why is this so quiet y official Quicken
[03:08:10] y
[03:08:12] official X and ya
[03:08:19] squared my bad that's the one I meant I
[03:08:30] didn't oh
[03:08:34] this are you
[03:08:36] dumb I'm sorry thanks for the 100 bits
[03:08:38] Min lemon but if you you know what I'm
[03:08:41] pulling up Ms paint
[03:08:49] I forgot that was my
[03:08:50] background if you have a variable let's
[03:08:53] say a a could be any number okay why
[03:08:54] they speed it up multiply that number by
[03:08:57] another one okay there's a few ways to
[03:08:58] write a multiplication uh you could do
[03:08:59] an X you could do a DOT or nothing just
[03:09:01] a space for example if you write a b
[03:09:04] right this is a Time B but you don't
[03:09:06] need to write that you just write a b so
[03:09:07] let's say instead of a you do ya right
[03:09:09] ya and then you put another ya this is
[03:09:12] ya time ya ya X ya or just ya ya is ya
[03:09:16] time ya now the a number times itself uh
[03:09:20] well this is why you could also say like
[03:09:21] let's say ya times ya could also be
[03:09:22] simplified by doing this you remove this
[03:09:24] ya and then you put this to the power of
[03:09:26] two and then it will this will equal to
[03:09:28] ya times ya true also known as yao
[03:09:34] yao yao to the second power Yao square
[03:09:37] is our character the [ __ ] is Z gets
[03:09:41] humbled this is one like should be
[03:09:45] dead okay it's not that I thought the
[03:09:47] pillars would kill

[04:48:58] way she does, 1500 there's actually no
[04:49:00] way so we're fine uh I don't need to
[04:49:01] skill I'm just going
[04:49:02] to
[04:49:11] [Music]
[04:49:14] that's Destiny isn't
[04:49:16] chosen
[04:49:19] f stand still [ __ ]
[04:49:24] ah well well it's
[04:49:32] fine if you're struggling I'm imagine 10
[04:49:34] I'm not struggling how the [ __ ] do you
[04:49:36] think I'm struggling I'm just not all
[04:49:39] there mentally but that doesn't mean I'm
[04:49:41] struggling there's a difference should I
[04:49:43] use Argent
[04:49:45] here kind of want Argy they're physical
[04:49:48] weak I mean they're also imaginary weak
[04:49:59] but oh I probably should use that team
[04:50:01] here this guy's weak to both oh yeah
[04:50:04] wait wait wait I should remake that
[04:50:06] team okay we're playing this for
[04:50:09] sure we're doing this for sure no matter
[04:50:12] what where's Ron may this team is
[04:50:15] happening uh and then second
[04:50:18] [Music]
[04:50:19] team I don't think it matters Argent
[04:50:21] works and biter
[04:50:23] works is there a better one probably but
[04:50:26] I don't think it really
[04:50:29] matters is my Argent
[04:50:32] built
[04:50:36] you have ageless I
[04:50:39] might where the [ __ ] is
[04:50:42] Argent what's my r on no she's on vwac
[04:50:46] oh yeah we're doing this but it's not S5
[04:50:48] so don't talk to
[04:50:50] me but I have W ho so I I'm
[04:50:54] chilling
[04:50:59] um wait I want to take Argy I got
[04:51:01] distracted Argent are you geared
[04:51:04] it's actually not bad uh this is
[04:51:14] okay is hoo slow i y her boots on BR I
[04:51:18] could give them back now I guess wait no
[04:51:21] she has boots wait she's okay it's fine
[04:51:23] don't talk to me then or did I take
[04:51:26] fen's boots whose boots did I take I
[04:51:27] took her
[04:51:30] boots we're not BR here so I can do that
[04:51:42] [Music]
[04:51:44] maybe init is
[04:51:47] better wa what's my ratio that's
[04:51:50] actually not that
[04:51:53] bad Chad do you want to see Argent oror
[04:51:55] I don't
[04:52:01] care guide maker I mean they the
[04:52:06] same one's just more AOE than the other
[04:52:09] Argent
[04:52:14] okay
[04:52:16] Pella
[04:52:18] um actually do I even want a Pella what
[04:52:21] do I feel like yeah I could also silver
[04:52:25] wolf doesn't really give me an advantage
[04:52:28] I don't know how AOE this one is
[04:52:30] actually I'm going to assume there's
[04:52:31] more than one
[04:52:32] dude
[04:52:36] I'm want a Pella
[04:52:43] P yeah that should be
[04:52:50] fun okay my U is going to need more than
[04:52:53] 2700 HP though I feel like I'm going to
[04:52:55] get [ __ ] if I'm on this low
[04:52:59] HP
[04:53:01] um I should also probably go [ __ ]
[04:53:11] vwac oh I'm on a defense ball I think
[04:53:15] that's
[04:53:18] why bra I could bra I'd have to speed
[04:53:22] tune her
[04:53:24] though honestly yeah I probably could
[04:53:32] right but I'm GNA have to dude my build
[04:53:35] is I have [ __ ]
[04:53:44] one my friend Drew IX
[04:53:50] flower uh one
[04:53:56] second wait who took my crit damage ball
[04:53:59] is it this one no it's on this set oh

[04:54:31] fine okay this just better
[04:54:35] okay this is
[04:54:37] okay yeah this should be
[04:55:00] fine skill points can we just launcher
[04:55:03] Lacher
[04:55:04] uh what would our rotation be one minus
[04:55:06] one - one minus one so you lose three
[04:55:10] and then she gives you minus one and
[04:55:11] then you get a skill point you get a
[04:55:12] skill point and then him he gives you
[04:55:14] three for that he'll give you one for
[04:55:15] that one one yeah no we actually can't
[04:55:18] keep up
[04:55:21] uh yeah bronny would have to be
[04:55:24] faster I mean we could also just like
[04:55:26] say [ __ ] it one
[04:55:31] time okay yeah this is this is not worth
[04:55:34] the [ __ ] brain power for floor 10 if
[04:55:37] I lose with paila then I don't deserve
[04:55:39] to
[04:55:40] win or it's
[04:55:43] beow all
[04:55:52] right a for boing

[04:56:46] minute uh where the [ __ ] is it it's one
[04:56:49] of these [ __ ] traces not
[04:56:55] technique yeah I mean this should be
[04:56:58] fine
[04:56:59] then I
[04:57:02] mean
[04:57:16] surely
[04:57:18] surely surely we don't get
[04:57:26] spammed oh four basics yeah I don't
[04:57:28] really care about our
[04:57:31] damage surely
[04:57:34] it's fine if it doesn't work we can
[04:57:36] blame her a foring sign
[04:57:39] Sounder does that
[04:57:45] hurt
[04:57:47] Eternal
[04:57:49] oh stand still every pedal all will be
[04:57:53] swept away by the wind I use his brain
[04:57:56] honestly I feel like Star most of it is
[04:57:58] like a lot of thinking for gearing and
[04:58:01] speed tuning and team building and like
[04:58:03] building your characters but once you're
[04:58:05] in the fight it's like you follow a very
[04:58:07] like same formula almost every fight
[04:58:10] unless something goes wrong and you need
[04:58:11] to like heal it's like always the same
[04:58:13] [ __ ]
[04:58:14] buttons for the most
[04:58:20] part like I don't even need
[04:58:24] to what do you want to
[04:58:27] know which is why it's like annoying to
[04:58:30] like gear for like 6 hours but you have
[04:58:32] to because if anything [ __ ] then your
[04:58:34] whole like every turn is going to be
[04:58:38] [ __ ] time
[04:58:44] to is like genin no no this is not the
[04:58:47] this is not the the hill to compare them
[04:58:50] on they're like very that's where
[04:58:52] they're the most different I feel
[04:59:02] like
[04:59:04] stand
[04:59:08] still retribution will find
[04:59:12] you your
[04:59:22] [Music]
[04:59:29] man every pedal all will be swept away
[04:59:32] by the wind
[04:59:43] okay
[04:59:47] well that was a lot of damage I feel
[04:59:49] like my TIG Yun on the second half is uh
[04:59:52] dead as
[04:59:53] [ __ ] to say maybe

[05:22:08] I mean who knows it's good it's good
[05:22:10] it's actually really good this is a
[05:22:12] really good piece it's just not for my
[05:22:13] fuan it's really good wrong character
[05:22:16] but I already have no this does have cr
[05:22:19] I mean it's good this is great this is
[05:22:21] great I just not now not now it's good
[05:22:23] but not now it's good but not that's not
[05:22:26] what I wanted right now I wanted a
[05:22:29] def
[05:22:35] I could roll this and then go for a
[05:22:38] different
[05:22:41] body what the [ __ ] this has 23 K
[05:22:47] damage that's on Ron may I don't want to
[05:22:49] take it this one has no defense 4% this
[05:22:52] one could be good if it rolls
[05:22:59] defense
[05:23:04] 15 defense wait which
[05:23:07] one yeah but it's on Ron
[05:23:10] may I mean Ron may could use something
[05:23:13] else but
[05:23:18] dude this is so much effort it's
[05:23:29] fine
[05:23:37] I honestly think we're fine as it stands
[05:23:39] I'll roll one more piece like I'll roll
[05:23:44] this okay sure I mean we're going to
[05:23:47] keep it but this like I don't even know
[05:23:50] who would use that I'm not even
[05:23:55] kidding
[05:23:59] gearing wait y rope is not bad what are
[05:24:02] you yapping about
[05:24:05] chatter I would rather cut speed than
[05:24:07] err okay maybe not
[05:24:10] but maybe not that that's not true but
[05:24:12] it's not bad I don't know what you're
[05:24:14] yapping
[05:24:25] about run LOA at this point honestly I'm
[05:24:29] tempted I'm actually very
[05:24:38] tempted okay I think we do what I said I
[05:24:41] was going to do which is change
[05:24:44] literally nothing but our headpiece so
[05:24:46] if there's a headpiece with defense I'll
[05:24:48] just roll it like HP defense not just
[05:24:50] defense HP speed could get
[05:24:57] defense got [ __ ] crit rate okay
[05:25:10] this one has defense percent no HP this
[05:25:12] one has HP no defense defense no HP HP
[05:25:15] no defense do I just have to roll all
[05:25:17] these and prey [ __ ]
[05:25:24] it it got flat
[05:25:29] defense
[05:25:36] what if I level this set
[05:25:44] honestly
[05:25:47] Jeepers give me
[05:25:59] HP you're [ __ ] me
[05:26:02] right wait what is
[05:26:06] this am I ever using this no
[05:26:11] okay wait this is
[05:26:19] good okay well okay well okay well okay
[05:26:26] well all Ron may go [ __ ]
[05:26:29] yourself
[05:26:32] 6.8k 1500 okay our speed could be a bit
[05:26:35] higher but it is what it is and we have
[05:26:37] ER so I think this is fine for now our
[05:26:41] ball sucks and our rope sucks but I
[05:26:44] think it's fine like it doesn't we don't
[05:26:46] have to if you have to Mid Max past this
[05:26:47] that's a team issue or a gameplay issue
[05:26:49] like there's there's no
[05:26:52] way uh I need to change her body now
[05:26:55] though but I don't think that's going to
[05:26:57] be too hard I'll just yo it from are we
[05:26:59] uh we're playing Co oh we're also
[05:27:01] playing pil I'll just take a random HP

[05:27:17] give this a ho ho wait let's see how
[05:27:19] much this let's this guess do I throw

[05:29:23] lose
[05:29:29] f although to be fair this team kind of
[05:29:31] plays
[05:29:33] itself you kind of just press

[05:46:59] speeding like a [ __ ]

[05:47:04] unfortunate but it is what it
[05:47:06] is worlding
[05:47:11] Dragon okay that's really good
[05:47:14] damage this is going a lot better than
[05:47:16] last time I don't
[05:47:20] really know what went wrong but it is
[05:47:22] what it is uh I don't need to skill here
[05:47:25] do
[05:47:27] that
[05:47:36] B okay we're [ __ ] this guy up I'm
[05:47:39] going to do this for
[05:47:42] energy
[05:47:43] sorry Yin but also Yang all right we
[05:47:47] just
[05:47:48] win oh it was a lot
[05:47:51] easier
[05:47:53] friends a thousand wonders to
[05:47:57] fight
[05:48:00] enemy targets detected they're death
[05:48:01] shredded and myor is uh a buffed so I
[05:48:03] don't see why I wouldn't Al here they're
[05:48:06] basically like fully
[05:48:09] buffed um can I use
[05:48:12] skill I'm not going to risk
[05:48:15] it this strength Heaven
[05:48:19] search [ __ ] you
[05:48:22] [Music]
[05:48:27] Sam Creations human
[05:48:31] Creations I like how gearing took longer
[05:48:33] than
[05:48:41] fighting implementation enemy data net
[05:48:45] time for a good old
[05:48:56] counter S A stor heaven
[05:49:04] okay that was kind of annoying but not
[05:49:06] too bad all right 12 time woo 12
[05:49:11] time God damn it I have to play oh can I
[05:49:13] play blade okay I can play blade thank
[05:49:15] [ __ ] god thank God thank [ __ ] God
[05:49:18] I can play blade okay that should be
[05:49:21] easy
[05:49:24] uh yeah
[05:49:27] okay
[05:49:36] Pella
[05:49:46] Pella okay I'm going to have to speed
[05:49:47] tune really fast but outside of that
[05:49:49] we're going to do this
[05:49:51] this uh probably pea again
[05:49:57] actually
[05:50:14] got to this guy insta kills you right
[05:50:17] would it ever be correct to just double
[05:50:18] healer cuz like why
[05:50:21] not maybe I'll probably just peelo
[05:50:27] though
[05:50:34] or do I have to I have to kill the thing
[05:50:35] right whatever we'll be
[05:50:37] fine I can't see us unless I okay wait
[05:50:41] let
[05:50:42] me I need to level this so that my speed
[05:50:44] tuning Cals aren't [ __ ]
[05:50:46] griefing whatever I don't feel like
[05:50:48] leveling it
[05:50:51] um this is good I just need to do my 17
[05:50:55] whatever the [ __ ]
[05:50:57] speed
[05:51:12] this not crit damage but I'll take
[05:51:22] it all right let me see
[05:51:26] something okay
[05:51:49] I need pieces that have literally zero
[05:51:51] speed sub
[05:51:53] stats or I do 170
[05:51:57] something he's more than 100 so probably
[05:52:02] like probably a bit more like
[05:52:11] 174 let me
[05:52:25] think I could just make it really slow I
[05:52:27] could also just give my this guy my
[05:52:29] blade like speed boots but I still I
[05:52:31] don't think I still got I don't think I
[05:52:33] have good speed boots yet right I mean
[05:52:35] that could yeah I don't think I got good
[05:52:38] speed boots
[05:52:41] yet like this one could technically get
[05:52:43] crit
[05:52:46] damage yeah I mean
[05:52:50] maybe maybe this only rolls crit an HP
[05:52:53] but
[05:52:57] yeah
[05:52:59] the problem with like really fast BR is
[05:53:01] like I get a skill point right sure and
[05:53:03] then it lines up with blade but I don't
[05:53:05] even do anything with the skill point
[05:53:07] cuz I'm running [ __ ] paila who
[05:53:08] doesn't care and like a Healer who
[05:53:10] doesn't care so it's not like the skill
[05:53:12] point does anything so I don't yeah I
[05:53:14] don't know unless my Blade's fast I
[05:53:16] don't really see the
[05:53:19] point so I think I just filter by crit
[05:53:21] damage and I go from
[05:53:27] there
[05:53:39] I have a CR damage body without speed oh
[05:53:41] wait this is the wrong set I don't need
[05:53:42] that set do I even need a single set in
[05:53:45] general I could do two L
[05:53:53] Vu wait do I actually not have okay [ __ ]
[05:53:56] it I could go
[05:53:57] fire
[05:53:58] oh I'm filtering sub stats right oh no
[05:54:01] I'm not filtering anymore this is not
[05:54:03] genin little
[05:54:05] bro where did my filter go
[05:54:14] uh dude these are all speed holy [ __ ]
[05:54:17] wait I'm actually I can't there's no
[05:54:19] crit damage on my boots unless I take
[05:54:21] this but that's un
[05:54:27] blade
[05:54:30] could go attack boots and try not to
[05:54:33] die no
[05:54:38] um could also just level this [ __ ] it
[05:54:41] I'd rather have HP than defense just
[05:54:43] because it looks better and I feel like
[05:54:45] I might Flex it onto another
[05:54:47] character copium defense
[05:54:57] scaling
[05:55:12] okay then I just need a crit damage body
[05:55:14] that doesn't
[05:55:17] have speed on it so I'm going to filter
[05:55:19] by crit damage what the [ __ ] did I just
[05:55:22] do
[05:55:25] oh
[05:55:26] uh that's
[05:55:29] fine speed no
[05:55:33] no no no okay the first one's the best
[05:55:39] yeah
[05:55:42] okay wait how do I still have twopiece
[05:55:45] oh I didn't change my [ __ ]
[05:55:56] gloves all right sorry to
[05:55:59] what is this theote Wawa Wawa is the
[05:56:01] best it's only second to peep

[05:56:31] if I need space stealing on someone nope
[05:56:33] gloth clears Bozo okay fair fair enough
[05:56:36] fair enough gloth clears okay this is
[05:56:39] [ __ ] dog [ __ ] well thanks for nothing
[05:56:43] thanks for nothing uh well that is
[05:56:47] [ __ ] atrocious let me filter Now by
[05:56:50] HP boots [ __ ] defense I guess do I have
[05:56:53] one that has crit damage on the
[05:56:55] subie crit damage
[05:57:02] cuz at least hp's more like well even
[05:57:04] defense is flexible actually I don't
[05:57:06] know what I'm okay maybe I'll just I'll
[05:57:08] just level
[05:57:09] this what is bro yapping about today
[05:57:13] effect res crit damage could be good
[05:57:26] um
[05:57:28] hey Z I love the streams but when do you
[05:57:30] stop
[05:57:33] gearing that's what I think you guys
[05:57:35] sound like
[05:57:36] chat oh got crit rate it's kind of bad
[05:57:39] but whatever I'll just unlock it but
[05:57:40] keep it on her all right this is not
[05:57:43] great but do I have enough wait do I
[05:57:44] even have enough effect res I do yes
[05:57:48] sorry shut the [ __ ] up Z sorry

[05:58:08] do 171 or like 174 or zero those are my
[05:58:13] two builds I can't do the middle I can't
[05:58:14] do the middle it's either zero or it's
[05:58:16] 175 it's one or the other it's one or
[05:58:19] the other it's zero or it's 17 something
[05:58:22] what do you prefer the thing
[05:58:26] is

[05:58:52] headpiece is okay I'd have to lose this
[05:58:55] for like I don't know like look these
[05:58:58] [ __ ] stats I'd have to get something
[05:58:59] that has at least a bit of speed but I
[05:59:00] don't have one I don't think unless okay
[05:59:03] I just farmed that maybe that real speed
[05:59:05] [ __ ] it maybe you know what maybe that
[05:59:08] plus
[05:59:13] one I all T by accident I'm

[05:59:33] our blade is actually insane like super
[05:59:36] insane but usually we do blade BR on
[05:59:38] like a million [ __ ] speed and then we
[05:59:40] just Loop the turns then I run someone
[05:59:41] else that can use the skill

[06:07:14] guess I already went on P but my P
[06:07:15] doesn't have an ALT which means I would
[06:07:16] lose so much damage cuz they're not but
[06:07:18] they have a bit of dam so I can like do
[06:07:19] some stuff although I wish I could have

[06:24:29] might have to change team this is
[06:24:31] literally inor propaganda though is it
[06:24:32] not net Mark activ time for a good old
[06:24:41] [Music]
[06:24:43] counter eternal return or QQ yeah
[06:24:47] although he's not weak to that but you
[06:24:49] can probably just implanted or some
[06:24:51] [ __ ] savor it for
[06:24:54] me
[06:24:57] have theer hand you use a skill on P
[06:24:59] more often yeah obviously I didn't read
[06:25:01] that I mean that's my fault I
[06:25:03] guess okay I
[06:25:05] [Music]
[06:25:06] mean yeah okay I'll use in biter
[06:25:10] whatever
[06:25:14] whatever and
[06:25:17] biter do I just yink Ron May cuz first
[06:25:20] team doesn't even need it
[06:25:22] anymore I could also just BR make her
[06:25:25] really really
[06:25:32] fast Tang yeah
[06:25:37] but actually yeah tun could just get
[06:25:40] eaten and
[06:25:41] then Ron May is the best here but I feel
[06:25:43] like our first team we could
[06:25:47] pea
[06:25:54] surly
[06:26:04] I like laa cuz he hits he does damage
[06:26:08] like he he hits twice and it helps break
[06:26:11] and you prevent the res on whatever the
[06:26:13] [ __ ] like you remove the debuff topaz I
[06:26:16] mean not topaz what's her name fan
[06:26:20] also does damage but I don't really like
[06:26:22] her
[06:26:23] there cuz it's not not the same and it's
[06:26:26] not imaginary and then W gives a [ __ ]
[06:26:29] ton of energy but I think this is
[06:26:32] probably the
[06:26:37] play which easier cuz you guess yeah
[06:26:40] yeah yeah yeah I think this is the
[06:26:50] play also before you call my listen

[06:45:56] stream I'll probably do a blaz clear as
[06:45:57] well I just think I I didn't understand
[06:45:59] how the skill point stuff worked so you
[06:46:00] probably run someone else with him that
[06:46:02] spam skill points savor it for me that
[06:46:05] was fun though [ __ ] that Meme thing
[06:46:08] receive Divinity it's a pretty cool
[06:46:15] Enemy talking about it
[06:46:18] no in the lunar
[06:46:21] flame no I've been live for almost 7
[06:46:23] hours to send
[06:46:34] you the Dead
[06:46:39] return all will be swept away by the

[06:47:26] set savor it for
[06:47:29] me why you ask me what I think about
[06:47:31] OverWatch

[06:47:37] happy I don't know I haven't played the
[06:47:38] game usually whenever the devs change
[06:47:40] anything it's just a bad change that's
[06:47:42] usually how it goes in that game but uh
[06:47:44] apparently Genji's good so I'm happy I
[06:47:49] guess in lunar
[06:47:52] Flame
[06:47:54] fail to send

[06:48:11] turns never go away when they're in
