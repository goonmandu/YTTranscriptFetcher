[00:17:39] other
[00:17:41] so anyways uh welcome to the stream chat
[00:17:44] we're going to do star rail today um
[00:17:48] we're going to do star rail
[00:17:50] today
[00:17:51] because there are new characters whoa
[00:17:54] poggers now if I was a purely star rail
[00:17:58] content creator I would have [ __ ]
[00:17:59] made a March 12th video cuz the freeo
[00:18:02] play version looks pretty good uh you
[00:18:04] could play her crit or break she looks
[00:18:05] pretty fun uh but that would mean I'd
[00:18:08] have to speedrun the story to unlock her
[00:18:09] and I kind of don't you know uh like
[00:18:12] feel like it so it is what it is uh but
[00:18:14] we're going to be we're going to get her
[00:18:15] and then I'll get her off stream
[00:18:16] probably and then play her on stream and
[00:18:17] we're going to pull for y today so t uh
[00:18:21] also
[00:18:24] um I will oh you can unlock her early oo
[00:18:29] never mind we'll get her today too then
[00:18:31] Okay I
[00:18:32] lied
[00:18:34] um no also for for like Star rail like
[00:18:38] like I think I'm just going to play it
[00:18:40] every patch when I want to and then for
[00:18:41] like guide stuff I'll do it if I care
[00:18:43] about the character or have time like
[00:18:45] like I feel like this half is more like
[00:18:47] whatever um but like like I feel like
[00:18:49] there's some characters that I'm a lot
[00:18:50] more hyped for so we're kind of just
[00:18:52] taking it easy for now but anyways um
[00:18:55] let's start by stalling let's start I
[00:18:57] think we can all agree that starting by
[00:18:59] stalling is the best way and then we'll
[00:19:01] watch the Emily video and then
[00:19:09] Antonio you are my favorite you a Mose
[00:19:12] guide I don't know it depends I mean I
[00:19:14] think he looks really like I like the
[00:19:16] character so I don't
[00:19:18] know
[00:19:20] probably I I do think his silhouette
[00:19:23] looks cooler than him wearing this
[00:19:26] outfit like like like he looked like his
[00:19:29] silhouette made him look like oh [ __ ]
[00:19:31] this guy's like a [ __ ] assassin now
[00:19:33] it's like like kis [ __ ] sampo and this
[00:19:36] is their child but like it is like he

[00:42:19] rain but add a drop of something
[00:42:25] unexpected and you never know what can
[00:42:29] blo this sounds like yinger theme life
[00:42:32] is like why it so like that sweeps
[00:42:34] across the
[00:42:37] land
[00:42:41] booom Emily you [ __ ] idiot when
[00:42:43] there's a sweet flower that has three
[00:42:45] dots on it don't click on it that means
[00:42:47] it's going to spawn a Whopper flower you
[00:42:49] don't don't
[00:42:57] yeah I think her doesn't her signature
[00:42:59] not match her at all by the way it's a
[00:43:00] it's a cool signature though when spices
[00:43:02] are abundant it all comes down to car
[00:43:10] [Music]
[00:43:15] selection sorry sorry
[00:43:18] sorry don't [ __ ] talk my wife I
[00:43:23] didn't
[00:43:25] water yes the most important perfume is
[00:43:29] the easiest to
[00:43:31] overlook pure water Ki pure water is a
[00:43:35] good song If you haven't heard
[00:43:39] it with no color or odor all other
[00:43:43] ingredients have nowhere to hide
[00:43:46] removing all distractions allows the
[00:43:48] true form to take shape then I think
[00:43:52] I'll combine the air after it rains the
[00:43:56] nectar of a icy
[00:43:59] flower
[00:44:01] okay like I feel like why do they like

[01:01:43] thank you we're just going to get ezero
[01:01:45] obviously we're not going to get the L
[01:01:47] cone uh however I will reread
[01:01:50] it GRE increases the we's chance of
[01:01:52] getting attacked and increases crit
[01:01:53] damage by 36% afterw us all
[01:01:58] each quite a lot of
[01:02:02] damage I will say something uh first of
[01:02:05] all I'm not making a guide on this
[01:02:07] character obviously I would have already
[01:02:08] been out but maybe for second half but
[01:02:10] or next patch I haven't decided yet
[01:02:12] however I I built her watch this watch
[01:02:14] this you ready you ready you ready okay
[01:02:15] first of all I had to yoink blades like
[01:02:17] con now you might be like Z why well
[01:02:19] first of all it gives me crit rate and I
[01:02:20] need crit rate second of all that's
[01:02:21] literally it now yes I could use Aon but
[01:02:24] [ __ ] you anyways
[01:02:26] secondly
[01:02:29] um I leveled all these people well I
[01:02:32] already have salotto my Salo kind of
[01:02:33] sucks but I'm a Sal look as a salotto
[01:02:36] lover from day one our stocks are at an
[01:02:38] all-time high okay everyone's been
[01:02:40] [ __ ] salotto and their mother okay
[01:02:42] except like Break characters SoDo stocks
[01:02:44] have been going up with that in mind uh
[01:02:47] I I've been fing the new set and I
[01:02:50] leveled like 20 feathers or gloves they
[01:02:54] all sucked then I strong boxed one and
[01:02:56] it got double crit now the problem is
[01:02:58] what the [ __ ] now the problem
[01:03:04] is the problem is I don't have enough
[01:03:07] crit rate cuz this character wants a lot
[01:03:09] of crit rate so but it is what cuz I
[01:03:11] have a crit damage body only but it is
[01:03:13] what it is I have a good body I have a
[01:03:15] good uh feet I have good sphere good
[01:03:19] rope my head sucks dick but it's fine uh
[01:03:23] I don't have a better one but like I
[01:03:24] actually I found this so much like look
[01:03:26] at all this [ __ ]
[01:03:31] anyways crit DPS wants crit no weighing
[01:03:33] no no but her in particular cuz her alt
[01:03:35] is like your next crit does way more Dam
[01:03:38] or like yeah increases the crit damage
[01:03:39] of your hit I don't know we could read
[01:03:41] it when we get her but I know you want
[01:03:42] extra crit rate on her so like even
[01:03:45] though this piece is better substat
[01:03:47] efficiency wise I might go this just for
[01:03:48] a bit more crit rate we'll see but
[01:03:53] anyways craft the crit raid one I have
[01:03:56] one but the substats suck and look at
[01:03:58] this nine crit rate you you but also my
[01:04:00] other pieces no no no no no no don't
[01:04:02] nice try buddy it's not even that bad
[01:04:03] look at this look at this look at this
[01:04:04] look at this you ready you ready let's
[01:04:07] go it's 77 and she gets like 6% crit
[01:04:11] rate on ascension or something like
[01:04:12] through her traces so we'll have over 80
[01:04:14] which like you should have like 90 to
[01:04:15] 100 but [ __ ] you don't talk to me it's
[01:04:17] fine I'll figure it out okay we're
[01:04:18] pulling

[01:37:24] mid but the alt and counter look pretty
[01:37:34] huge yeah this is why you want a lot of
[01:37:36] crit rate because it does increases the
[01:37:39] crit damage dealt by only next counter
[01:37:41] by 100 so if you miss the crit that
[01:37:43] doesn't like carry over right you miss
[01:37:44] the crit you're cooked minus 100 [ __ ]
[01:37:48] cooked nice crit raate
[01:37:52] Bozo so yeah
[01:38:03] I only have 84.2 crit rate am I cooked
[01:38:06] am I
[01:38:08] cooked am I
[01:38:12] cooked I could get more if I swap hands
[01:38:16] but like this one is like lowkey a lot
[01:38:17] worse but now I'm 90.0 which kind of
[01:38:19] looks visually pleasing I can't lie I
[01:38:22] can't lie this looks good
[01:38:26] it's just a lot worse substat like it's
[01:38:28] only crit rate the rest suck whereas
[01:38:30] here you got some attack you got some
[01:38:31] crit damage but this looks better so
[01:38:33] sure I
[01:38:38] guess just get
[01:38:41] E2 okay this is good but it doesn't even
[01:38:44] solve the crit raate
[01:38:45] problem into my
[01:38:50] fan not a bad call actually
[01:38:53] actually it is a bad call we're playing
[01:38:54] ho ho Okay I uh we're going to play her
[01:38:57] now she's leveled but I have to pee so
[01:38:59] you guys are going to wait while I

[01:42:25] [Music]
[01:42:42] sorry I fell while I was
[01:42:47] peeing Nom n
[01:42:54] hello I'm back
[01:42:57] sorry
[01:42:59] ew also before I went to PE someone was
[01:43:02] like what's her best set okay 5 minutes
[01:43:04] no not even 30 second speedrun you ready
[01:43:06] okay you can use this new set wind
[01:43:08] soaring [ __ ] okay valerant use this or
[01:43:11] uninstall just kidding this uh followup
[01:43:13] set is actually pretty close so but you
[01:43:15] probably already farmed the followup set
[01:43:16] and you don't want to farm this garbage
[01:43:17] unless you need a Brak set if you need a
[01:43:19] Brak set get it if you don't what are
[01:43:20] you doing with your life you can run Ash
[01:43:22] blazing Grand d all good or you could
[01:43:23] just twopiece twopiece but that's a bit
[01:43:25] worse but it's fine okay you're welcome
[01:43:27] also iny sto or the new one what's the
[01:43:29] new one called Forge of the Cal actually
[01:43:31] no just go [ __ ] uh go inert don't be
[01:43:36] dumb that's not the one it's the other
[01:43:37] one what's the other one this one a
[01:43:39] Duran my bad I got a brain fart Duran's
[01:43:42] good too uh but I'm pretty sure they're
[01:43:44] like it's I think it's like 1% worse
[01:43:47] I've only seen pre-release CS though I'm
[01:43:49] being honest there might be new ones but
[01:43:51] inert was like 1% better they're they're
[01:43:53] basically as good but inerd is like old
[01:43:56] so you probably have it and it's good on
[01:43:57] a lot of
[01:43:59] characters yeah Duran also like it
[01:44:01] depends cuz you got to stack it up but
[01:44:04] uh inner Soo is like the default but
[01:44:07] Duran also very good and then if not you
[01:44:09] could do like random [ __ ] like random
[01:44:12] sets that give you stats like that but
[01:44:15] yeah uh
[01:44:17] also you can use as a free-to-play
[01:44:19] choice you can use a on the fall of an
[01:44:21] Aon which is pog but I have blade Lon
[01:44:24] I'm using blade Lon cuz it gives me crit
[01:44:25] rate oh and
[01:44:26] damage all right her Sig's pretty good
[01:44:30] though D Run's 2% better at Max yeah but
[01:44:33] that's at
[01:44:34] Max so it kind of depends on the fight
[01:44:38] but good to know if
[01:44:41] true yeah her signature is really good
[01:44:43] it's like yeah well for her I don't
[01:44:46] think it's like actually I don't know
[01:44:48] how vers I haven't read it well I've
[01:44:49] read it but I forgot is it versatile or
[01:44:51] is it just good for her
[01:44:55] to my it gives crit damage and then
[01:44:57] damage bonus on the parri
[01:44:59] right on the on the it's full of attack
[01:45:02] damage that's what it is or use an
[01:45:04] ultimate so chance of getting attacked
[01:45:07] fine for Destruction crit damage always
[01:45:11] good and then when you use your ultimate
[01:45:14] you stack this up you can get
[01:45:16] it twice but it only lasts for two turns
[01:45:18] so for most characters that aren't her
[01:45:20] you might not be able to stack it twice
[01:45:23] 36% fall attack damage
[01:45:25] increase okay
[01:45:27] yeah mostly for
[01:45:30] her well I mean I guess CL how often
[01:45:32] does claraa Al I don't have claraa that
[01:45:35] looks good for claraa but I don't know
[01:45:36] how often she alss does she Al often if
[01:45:38] yes very good
[01:46:01] yeah it helps blade too but I wouldn't
[01:46:04] pull it just for well how high is the
[01:46:06] base HP 1058 what's blad
[01:46:13] likeone
[01:46:16] 1270 yeah it's it's pretty good for
[01:46:18] blade but
[01:46:21] seems actually let me look up a CL
[01:46:23] rotation I wonder how often you
[01:46:25] [Music]
[01:46:41] [Music]
[01:46:44] all yeah it looks good for her
[01:46:47] definitely good for claraa
[01:46:49] anyways what the [ __ ] just happened okay
[01:46:53] let's play the game let's play the
[01:46:56] game I do I'm actually really happy we

[01:47:11] before we do that we're going to do a

[03:36:14] BR though that's all I know I don't know
[03:36:16] what happened for the other I don't know
[03:36:17] how I don't know what happened for the
[03:36:18] other

[03:36:43] Emily I have no CL clue I know what
[03:36:46] Emily does but no I haven't haven't
[03:36:48] looked into her yet I'm going to
[03:36:50] probably look into Emily's kit like soon
[03:36:53] maybe to I don't know maybe tomorrow and
[03:36:56] then make a video for
[03:37:12] release she says ta
[03:37:17] all right a bit shorter than usual but I
[03:37:18] started streaming like [ __ ] 4:00 a.m.
[03:37:20] cuz I'm a dumb ass so my bad on that uh
[03:37:22] I'm going to BGE cuz I'm tired of [ __ ]
[03:37:24] so thanks for watching y's out POG uh
[03:37:26] I'll do another start stream kind of
[03:37:28] soon uh cuz I want to get this event
[03:37:30] done and I want to play March and I also
[03:37:32] no matter what we're streaming next half
[03:37:33] for the other dude jaia Q so yeah but I
[03:37:36] don't know I don't know we'll see uh
[03:37:38] it's hard now cuz there's so many
[03:37:40] [ __ ] games but I think we're going to
[03:37:42] do um next stream genin
[03:37:46] then I think we're doing okay imaginary
[03:37:48] and theater reset then Emily then
[03:37:51] basically whatever I want so either
[03:37:52] variety or zzz or waa or Star rail again
[03:37:55] or G like at that point I can do
[03:37:57] whatever I want so we'll see that's in
[03:37:58] like less than a week so yeah anyways
[03:38:01] next streams in probably a day and a
[03:38:03] half so let's like not today the day
[03:38:07] after which will be
[03:38:10] the imaginary and theater
[03:38:13] reset go so
[03:38:17] oops open
[03:38:20] twitch but yeah okay honest a in case
[03:38:22] you're wondering I actually think she's
[03:38:24] very fun and pretty solid like actually
[03:38:25] pretty strong you kind of need to know
[03:38:27] what you're doing well okay I don't
[03:38:28] think she's like you're like oh skill
[03:38:29] sealing like yeah I don't think she's
[03:38:31] like like you know you're going to miss
[03:38:33] some parries if you're a skill issue
[03:38:34] like me but you'll you recognize when
[03:38:36] enemies hit you pretty often and if they
[03:38:38] hit twice like if there's like double
[03:38:39] actions usually on the first one they'll
[03:38:41] hit you I it depends on the enemy so
[03:38:42] like all you need to do is just Al
[03:38:44] before they hit you but outside of that
[03:38:46] I think she's pretty solid pretty good
[03:38:48] character
[03:38:49] uh also pretty easy to build in my
[03:38:52] opinion her signature is pretty crack
[03:38:54] though like it's a pretty it's like 15
[03:38:56] plus% increase so it's definitely a good
[03:38:59] uh signature but overall she's
[03:39:03] good I don't think she's broken but
[03:39:05] she's pretty
[03:39:06] good um so yeah you don't need her
[03:39:09] though but if you want her PO put her in
[03:39:12] the middle of your team and uh Lynx is a
[03:39:14] good free to play healer for her but I
[03:39:16] think ly's healing kind of falls off
[03:39:17] like eventually having someone like
[03:39:18] Avent trange or something or like quo
[03:39:20] kind of carries
[03:39:24] you compared to claraa uh I'm honestly
[03:39:28] not confident enough to say right now so
[03:39:30] I would wait a little
[03:39:33] bit but yes Clara Pro
[03:39:38] Max but yeah anyways I like different
[03:39:41] memory chaos quite a bit but that's also
[03:39:44] like this one has physical weak enemies
[03:39:46] so
[03:39:49] yeah
[03:39:52] n intercepting sword
[03:40:00] technique
[03:40:02] oh all right that's all thanks for
[03:40:04] watching chat sorry for ending right now
[03:40:05] but it is 6:48 a.m. I'll be live again
[03:40:07] in like a day and a half two days let's
[03:40:09] say
