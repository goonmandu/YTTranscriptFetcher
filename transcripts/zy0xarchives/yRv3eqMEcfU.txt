[00:10:11] um it is what it is
[00:10:13] what it is I'm wearing the Gengar shirt
[00:10:15] again so I look like the floor at a
[00:10:17] bowling alley
[00:10:18] um I think it's cool if you don't [ __ ]
[00:10:21] you no one asked
[00:10:22] uh my one of my light bulbs died last
[00:10:24] stream I said I was gonna change it I
[00:10:26] didn't change it so it's still there
[00:10:29] but luckily since the live streams in
[00:10:32] the middle of the [ __ ] morning there
[00:10:34] should be better lighting because I have
[00:10:35] a window so when the sun's out
[00:10:42] where'd you get it I got it for the
[00:10:43] Pokemon Center
[00:10:45] in New York like the actual Pokemon
[00:10:46] store
[00:10:47] anyways doesn't matter [ __ ] you welcome
[00:10:49] to the stream we have a lot to do I was
[00:10:51] gonna start streaming literally
[00:10:56] l-i-c-h-t-r-l-i literally at like uh uh
[00:10:59] uh midnight then I decided to play Val
[00:11:01] with you Lee so I did that on his stream
[00:11:03] Twitch TV slash not Yuli then I was like
[00:11:05] okay cool then it was like 1am 2 am then
[00:11:08] I was like gonna stream but then I was
[00:11:09] like I don't know what happened and I
[00:11:10] was four so I don't know I was gonna do
[00:11:14] I have a video where it's gonna be I
[00:11:16] spent 100 000 resin per million right
[00:11:18] for sure boom it's gonna be like the
[00:11:20] first I was gonna start with like the
[00:11:21] bear no is these are like the despair
[00:11:23] pieces that
[00:11:24] I build I show I show it's like we're
[00:11:25] dead from it starts bad then it goes up
[00:11:27] to a Redemption Arc of like okay but my
[00:11:29] child still you know taught whatever the
[00:11:31] [ __ ] then Showcase of Xiao we do abyss
[00:11:34] and then we solo APAP Legends Apex
[00:11:36] Legend we solo the apat balls right boom
[00:11:39] that's gonna be good content a storyline
[00:11:40] it's gonna be hype it's gonna be nice
[00:11:42] and juicy the only problem is I now
[00:11:44] don't think we have enough time to do
[00:11:45] this anymore
[00:11:49] so
[00:11:51] we might start it today and finish it
[00:11:53] next stream is what I think I'm gonna do
[00:11:55] also we have some resin to spend we have
[00:11:57] a new but not same Abyss but a reset to
[00:11:59] do and we have the free to play account
[00:12:01] to keep progressing on because I don't
[00:12:03] want to say to not progress it I wanna
[00:12:06] progress and not regress couple
[00:12:08] questions
[00:12:09] and then I've become inspired in three
[00:12:12] hours exactly there will be the genjin
[00:12:15] live stream to watch we will watch it we
[00:12:18] will see oh in front end we're getting
[00:12:20] and we're gonna watch it also
[00:12:22] recommendations on where to go
[00:12:26] I did not hear you give me a second
[00:12:29] wait let me not open Twitter on stream
[00:12:31] just in case there's
[00:12:34] wait
[00:12:39] what the [ __ ] is it
[00:12:41] where is it
[00:12:52] made Saga dude this is LOL XD in our
[00:12:54] chat this dude literally okay let me up
[00:12:57] in his [ __ ] media tab
[00:12:59] let me show you let me show you LOL XD
[00:13:02] look look at this preview bro look
[00:13:06] this is this is like my my first spammer
[00:13:09] in my chat
[00:13:11] you can literally scroll forever like
[00:13:14] genuinely forever it does not stop I've
[00:13:17] never made it to the bottom and I've
[00:13:18] scrolled for over 10 minutes
[00:13:27] so check you
[00:13:30] yeah so um
[00:13:33] VIP then they're ready VIP I just
[00:13:35] sometimes take it away because whenever
[00:13:36] I'm trying to do a wholesome raid
[00:13:38] they'll spam like try hard socks right
[00:13:39] and then I have to [ __ ] ban them for
[00:13:41] a bit and so that they don't spam that
[00:13:42] and then I when they're when they're
[00:13:44] staying in normal again I VIP them so
[00:13:46] this yeah but
[00:13:48] they've been in time for it did I don't
[00:13:50] even know how to spell their all good
[00:13:51] doesn't matter anyways that's not the
[00:13:52] point of what I was doing point is we
[00:13:54] want to talk about this because I saw
[00:13:56] this
[00:13:59] I haven't streamed since they posted
[00:14:01] this so I thought on stream uh I did
[00:14:03] remember
[00:14:06] I made a trailer
[00:14:07] um
[00:14:08] let me switch accounts I'm sorry
[00:14:16] I made a short about it so first of all
[00:14:19] I uploaded my blade video on my second
[00:14:20] channel that Mariah edited Giga Chad by
[00:14:23] the way huge huge shout out to him
[00:14:26] um and I just called it blade blade
[00:14:28] blade blade blade blade blade blade
[00:14:29] blade because I thought it would be
[00:14:30] funny and it's one it's it's literally
[00:14:32] array at 50k views so I assumed that was
[00:14:33] a good call so uh anyways I really
[00:14:36] thought short about the new things so
[00:14:38] start saving your artifacts now because
[00:14:39] in version 4.0 cringe all good all good
[00:14:42] that's added to the artifact strong box
[00:14:44] all good which are pretty essential to
[00:14:46] farm it's educational Niche ones like
[00:14:48] husk for geo Mains or defense scaling
[00:14:51] characters
[00:14:52] clam for some healers Echoes for normal
[00:14:55] attackers like notably ayato Vermillion
[00:14:57] Hereafter yeah
[00:14:59] typing NPC you guys probably know me
[00:15:02] from my [ __ ] YouTube videos why is it
[00:15:05] like NPC it's normal hours which is
[00:15:08] great for certain characters that can
[00:15:09] make use of the four piece like yoy Mia
[00:15:11] wander or even hutau now I've been
[00:15:13] saving the best for last though as the
[00:15:14] two other sets are ones that virtually
[00:15:16] every account wants or needs without
[00:15:18] living best assault on so much this kit
[00:15:21] mainly revolves around their bursts
[00:15:23] is a great supportive side being the
[00:15:26] best is so good man it used to be only
[00:15:28] getting like two dudes but now someone
[00:15:29] you can use it also we didn't have
[00:15:30] enough time to keep like I I I literally
[00:15:33] didn't have time to make this short
[00:15:33] until one minute but
[00:15:35] I was like I mean I guess it doesn't
[00:15:37] matter but I was like naming characters
[00:15:38] I was like you know Layla give you some
[00:15:41] HP percent which makes it a great two
[00:15:43] piece for characters that scale on HP
[00:15:44] like notably nilu and so there's a ton
[00:15:46] of really amazing artifacts that's
[00:15:48] coming soon so enjoy having another way
[00:15:50] to farm emblem or waste everything on
[00:15:52] Vermillion again like I probably will
[00:15:54] aware so yeah that is one thing we
[00:15:57] missed uh I didn't actually yeah I
[00:15:59] didn't read all of it but I skimmed
[00:16:00] through it and um basically what do you
[00:16:03] need to know animation it's sick before
[00:16:05] the fourth I'll check the numbers in a
[00:16:06] second before the 4.0 live stream is so
[00:16:08] first of all we're getting a new [ __ ]
[00:16:10] we're literally oh this is actually huge
[00:16:12] we're getting well not just this I
[00:16:13] remembered something else that's huge
[00:16:14] but we're getting a new strong box which
[00:16:16] is [ __ ] sick
[00:16:17] um
[00:16:18] Vermillion being here is like I don't
[00:16:21] know how to feel it's really weird like
[00:16:23] I'm happy about it don't get me wrong
[00:16:25] but it's like what does this mean what
[00:16:29] does this mean like what does this mean
[00:16:31] do I need to do more does that mean I
[00:16:33] wasted a year of my life does this mean
[00:16:36] like I don't know is is it now worth it
[00:16:38] I guess it's optimal now to go for
[00:16:39] Vermilion instead of two piece two piece
[00:16:41] thing it
[00:16:43] anyways
[00:16:46] anyways uh aware now all I'm gonna say
[00:16:49] is guys if you please look look if I
[00:16:52] have Vermillion strongbox and make a
[00:16:54] video out of it you can excuse me if I
[00:16:57] emblem strongbox because I'm responsible
[00:16:58] hey you can type a w in the chat but I
[00:17:01] desperately need 43 if you know listen
[00:17:04] if you see me Farm Vermillion in the
[00:17:07] Vermilion domain then go to the
[00:17:10] Vermillion strong box and get more
[00:17:12] Vermillion I need you to say zox enough
[00:17:14] is enough please consult a licensed
[00:17:17] physician not physician please consult a
[00:17:20] medical expert in the field please
[00:17:22] someone
[00:17:23] intervene
[00:17:24] but I don't think okay I don't think I'm
[00:17:27] gonna Farm Vermillion I think
[00:17:29] no leaks whatsoever whatever new set
[00:17:32] comes with Fontaine because there's
[00:17:33] gonna be one we just know there's gonna
[00:17:34] we don't know what it is but there's
[00:17:36] gonna be some okay no leaks
[00:17:38] we'll Farm whatever is new and we're
[00:17:40] gonna Vermillion strongbox to make my
[00:17:42] shower as good as Xiao can Chao lament
[00:17:45] live laugh lament that is probably what
[00:17:47] we're gonna do and then we're also gonna
[00:17:48] strongbox emblem
[00:17:51] surely because I need emblem surely
[00:17:52] surely I doubt them surely calm down
[00:17:55] save my voice I'm gonna drink water
[00:17:57] foreign
[00:18:02] listen here
[00:18:04] every time there's been a new domain I
[00:18:06] went in it for a bit and then went back
[00:18:07] to Vermillion so I don't know how long
[00:18:09] the font like deepwood and gilded I
[00:18:12] literally dude do you know what's so
[00:18:13] [ __ ] I have a good gilded I have a
[00:18:16] good deep wood
[00:18:17] I I have a good husk I literally I farm
[00:18:20] Vermillion then I leave I do something I
[00:18:22] finish it before I finish for Millions I
[00:18:24] go back to Vermillion
[00:18:28] anyways
[00:18:32] anyways
[00:18:34] anyways here's what we're gonna do we
[00:18:36] are going to wait now let's keep reading
[00:18:38] this uh oh yeah also I saw this I saw
[00:18:40] this oh my God oh my God I'm POG
[00:18:42] champing look more optimizations for
[00:18:46] artifacts are currently in the plans
[00:18:49] locking of artifacts
[00:18:51] equipping of artifacts regarding the
[00:18:54] current cumbersome process of equipping
[00:18:56] artifacts we are currently discussing a
[00:18:58] new plan to help Travelers select and
[00:19:00] equip artifacts as quickly as possible
[00:19:02] now there are two possibilities either
[00:19:04] it's the fast equipped like in Star rail
[00:19:06] which is nothing in complete garbage
[00:19:10] or it's artifact presets which is
[00:19:12] literally the thing I've been asking for
[00:19:13] since I was literally in the womb the
[00:19:16] the delivery man had to have to take me
[00:19:18] out of the womb because I was literally
[00:19:19] I was literally fit I was literally
[00:19:21] already saying hey give me artifact
[00:19:23] presets
[00:19:26] okay not not that to that extent but I
[00:19:28] was actually okay if it's already
[00:19:29] presents I literally I will do anything
[00:19:32] I will gobble on any amount of socks you
[00:19:34] want
[00:19:37] so hopefully it's loadouts
[00:19:39] um let's see we're in the midst of
[00:19:40] disgusting class for about optimization
[00:19:43] yeah I don't know
[00:19:46] hopefully
[00:19:49] um and another big thing is new battle
[00:19:52] pass weapons again I've been asking for
[00:19:54] this I've probably tweeted about like
[00:19:55] three times I've asked about it a lot
[00:19:57] thank [ __ ] Allah because
[00:20:01] yeah like the current Battle episodes
[00:20:02] are good don't get me wrong they're good
[00:20:06] but
[00:20:07] hey more is more and [ __ ] the more
[00:20:11] the merrier you miss streaming on my
[00:20:14] birthday I missed see my birthday blink
[00:20:16] so yeah I'm very happy about this very
[00:20:18] very happy
[00:20:19] um
[00:20:20] if you buy the Belfast you know not
[00:20:22] everyone does but I think it's really
[00:20:24] nice to have more uh we'll have to see
[00:20:25] what they are I'll make a video on it
[00:20:26] probably
[00:20:29] um yeah they'll probably announce it
[00:20:31] this stream and then I'll probably I
[00:20:33] don't know we'll see and why don't I do
[00:20:35] I'll start recording
[00:20:37] paying for [ __ ] weapons lull W dude
[00:20:39] [ __ ] um
[00:20:42] uh what's it called [ __ ]

[00:30:50] it could be like yilon's Diet no it's
[00:30:53] not the other side is full never mind
[00:30:54] but it could be like a square like
[00:30:56] something that's a square I don't know
[00:30:57] we'll just guess like
[00:30:59] I genuinely don't know
[00:31:01] um
[00:31:03] I can go full try hard but I kind of
[00:31:05] don't want to because the day's about to
[00:31:06] reset so we're gonna do like a random
[00:31:09] character
[00:31:10] we'll say it's wrongly skill never mind

[00:35:05] music loud lower your mic voice
[00:35:09] okay [ __ ] you
[00:35:14] the chat is wrong like a kid's pajama
[00:35:18] but it does look like the floor of the
[00:35:20] bowling alley
[00:35:22] you look like the floor of a bowling
[00:35:24] alley yeah how about that
[00:35:26] sorry that was toxic
[00:35:28] there's nothing wrong with that okay
[00:35:32] um
[00:35:37] I did this and then this and then this
[00:35:40] and then
[00:35:42] is this too loud
[00:35:45] yeah it's a little loud okay I'll do two
[00:35:47] and then seven
[00:35:52] all right should be fine
[00:35:59] okay should be good
[00:36:01] is this level okay
[00:36:04] sorry that was weird
[00:36:06] option gets a rerun uh it's a little
[00:36:08] early well okay not true Xiao got a
[00:36:11] rerun
[00:36:12] his last one was like right after
[00:36:15] farazon came out but farazan wasn't on
[00:36:17] his Banner so it's like the dumbest [ __ ]
[00:36:19] ever
[00:36:20] so if Xiao gets another rerun without
[00:36:22] Tarzan I will literally I will make a
[00:36:25] pizza then eat the entire Pizza on
[00:36:27] stream without saying a word
[00:36:32] oh I have to just kill the [ __ ]
[00:36:34] Towers what am I doing I got distracted
[00:36:36] I can't [ __ ] stupid I shut up
[00:36:38] literally shut up let me shut up I got
[00:36:39] distracted I haven't played against in
[00:36:41] like two days shut up
[00:36:52] I've actually never played gunshot
[00:36:54] before
[00:36:56] ha
[00:36:57] ha
[00:36:59] do I have beef with kameos he posted
[00:37:01] like a tearless on Twitter I don't give
[00:37:02] a [ __ ] about cheerless because they're
[00:37:03] always like protractor I don't care it
[00:37:05] doesn't matter I do not give a [ __ ]
[00:37:06] about people's opinions but he put
[00:37:09] Wanderer and like good or whatever right
[00:37:10] sure I'm just freaking good and then
[00:37:12] right under he put Xiao as Niche no are
[00:37:16] you listen listen no bias whatsoever
[00:37:19] because I like I mean there's bias but I
[00:37:21] like animal characters so I want all of
[00:37:23] them to win in no world is is this guy
[00:37:28] more Niche than the other guy
[00:37:32] actually GG actually not even nah you
[00:37:34] can't even type based
[00:37:38] aren't they the same okay again
[00:37:42] I am not going to be what's this Niche
[00:37:44] AOE that's every Abyss yeah literally
[00:37:47] also Xiao God okay so people for for
[00:37:50] Gore right but like not to talk about
[00:37:51] this because everyone's like oh I hate
[00:37:53] child shut up no one asked but like
[00:37:56] shall get got buffed because
[00:37:58] they nerfed
[00:38:01] how do I say this they gave everyone a
[00:38:03] single Target team with hype when they
[00:38:04] released hyperloom so now it's like
[00:38:07] either you need AOE or you can just play
[00:38:09] hyperbloom so like single Target carries
[00:38:11] are like
[00:38:12] less needed
[00:38:16] maybe maybe that'll be the same with
[00:38:18] Virgin when they give us virgin
[00:38:21] when Virgin comes out maybe when we get
[00:38:22] Deo we can actually play virgin
[00:38:30] I will say though I think scarra is like
[00:38:33] 86 million times better for Overworld
[00:38:36] because you don't have to use your burst
[00:38:37] for any you can literally just fly
[00:38:38] around and just kill [ __ ] without having
[00:38:40] to burst it's so much nicer
[00:38:44] that's probably my main complaint with
[00:38:46] Shao is like if you can't so on this
[00:38:48] account I can just this this this and I
[00:38:50] can kill everything that's why I like it
[00:38:51] C1 I think it's C1 at high investment is
[00:38:54] like huge quality of life but
[00:38:57] um if you can't kill things with your
[00:39:00] two or three dashes it's like you have
[00:39:01] to burst that's [ __ ] annoying
[00:39:03] minus five months of not getting late
[00:39:07] wait why does that have anything to do
[00:39:09] with my stream
[00:39:12] if anything watching zox stream gives
[00:39:14] you more rizz watch on an example watch
[00:39:16] watch watch watch name me a character
[00:39:17] chat name a character I'll give you Riz
[00:39:19] with that character good look look name
[00:39:21] a character any character literally any
[00:39:22] character any character
[00:39:31] kaching
[00:39:35] no actually I can't do catching
[00:39:41] Daya okay watch this watches they are
[00:39:44] not just oh you like Dale right
[00:39:47] okay

[00:46:54] one X like normal like zy zero X try do
[00:46:57] it because I I used to not be able to
[00:46:59] but I think I might be able to know but
[00:47:00] I just don't feel like changing the
[00:47:01] description to every video I've ever
[00:47:04] made
[00:47:05] but I probably should like it's like a
[00:47:07] lot cleaner than [ __ ] three X's

[00:47:29] Who's hotter Rio or navient uh I
[00:47:32] actually don't know I want to say navier

[00:47:39] um the other like black hair dude I like
[00:47:42] the way he looks I don't know
[00:47:44] I actually don't know
[00:47:47] Bulls
[00:47:54] balls

[00:48:09] ziox fortnite account under yours
[00:48:11] there's a ziox fortnite account
[00:48:16] you're kidding right you have to be
[00:48:17] kidding
[00:48:28] laughs
[00:48:48] why were you seeing a Zion's fortnite
[00:48:50] account
[00:48:55] foreign
[00:49:18] [Music]
[00:49:49] [Music]
[00:49:51] wait what happened to the camera
[00:50:05] okay well fortnite
[00:50:08] I don't know what that was but I mean
[00:50:11] all good
[00:50:17] you know I've never played fortnite shot
[00:50:18] not once I haven't played fortnite or
[00:50:21] Apex I play most games but those I don't
[00:50:23] know
[00:50:25] Bulls donated one dollar cool it
[00:50:33] I never really liked I never liked bow
[00:50:36] Royals I never liked FPS games I only
[00:50:38] played OverWatch because I thought Genji
[00:50:40] was cool
[00:50:41] so I was like whatever I don't need a
[00:50:42] gun I could just shoot [ __ ] shurikens
[00:50:43] at people and I did and then I only
[00:50:45] played Valerian because all my friends
[00:50:46] played it and OverWatch [ __ ] died so
[00:50:48] now I'm kind of decent like fine
[00:50:51] but yeah
[00:50:59] don't you play Call of Duty okay as like
[00:51:01] a child on the Xbox but it doesn't count
[00:51:08] remember help comes first chow mein
[00:51:12] can't aim go figure story okay it's not
[00:51:14] even like dude it's literally my brain
[00:51:16] is so massive that I'm better at brain
[00:51:18] things but aim is literally just
[00:51:20] something you learn like it's it's not
[00:51:22] even hard you just [ __ ] practice it a
[00:51:24] bit and you're fine and most of aim is
[00:51:26] just movement anyways just varies based
[00:51:28] on the game you're playing that's why
[00:51:29] all the [ __ ] aim lab kids that think
[00:51:31] oh yeah same level like they're [ __ ]
[00:51:33] like
[00:51:35] yeah anyways
[00:51:47] nice try I saw you losing the kid level
[00:51:50] getting puzzles shut the [ __ ] up
[00:51:52] shut I [ __ ] you dude those puzzles okay
[00:51:56] either I'm a God at them or they're
[00:51:59] actually like like bad like maybe it's
[00:52:02] like the game like misled me that's not
[00:52:04] my fault
[00:52:23] seems like an emergency dude I remember
[00:52:26] we did like one of the old archon quests
[00:52:28] I don't remember which one but there's
[00:52:29] like a there's like Puzzles you have to
[00:52:31] solve and then it was like day night and
[00:52:33] it was like there's like a branch and it
[00:52:35] was like a big like puzzle area and
[00:52:36] everyone's like oh Pepe laugh it's gonna
[00:52:38] take them so long and the only reason it
[00:52:40] ended up taking me a bit long was
[00:52:42] because I was expecting it to be really
[00:52:43] hard and then it was super [ __ ]
[00:52:45] simple
[00:52:47] yeah the compass one that one I expected
[00:52:50] it to be hard and it was a lot easier
[00:52:52] than I thought so that was like the only
[00:52:53] reason I was like overthinking it
[00:53:01] can this guy
[00:53:07] the 2.7 one I don't remember
[00:53:12] why do you have three Twitter letters in
[00:53:14] your name I will ban you
[00:53:15] [Laughter]
[00:53:22] okay a30 compilation of him saying he's
[00:53:24] gonna ban someone it's [ __ ] hilarious
[00:53:28] okay not to be a react to Andy but uh
[00:53:34] I don't know how I ended up on this
[00:53:36] video but it's like you is not family
[00:53:39] friendly like Nick a 30s content this
[00:53:42] video is the king
[00:53:46] oh wait guys mods ban that guy and blow
[00:53:50] up his [ __ ] house
[00:53:52] okay I don't know how I ended up on this
[00:53:55] stream but
[00:53:58] can we ban him mods please thank you God
[00:54:02] it's like a meme but it's not like I'm
[00:54:04] actually being genuinely serious I'm not
[00:54:07] I'm one I don't know what the [ __ ] is
[00:54:08] happening but oh my God does reporting
[00:54:11] do anything in customs
[00:54:14] happy that's good you guys to wait
[00:54:16] before hey and the point is because some
[00:54:19] people might be revived at a different
[00:54:20] pace like this guy might be arrive a
[00:54:21] second later so that's why I'm getting
[00:54:22] you guys to wait before you shoot so the
[00:54:24] amazing is the cue for you guys to shoot
[00:54:26] so
[00:54:27] um let's say you all got res right now
[00:54:28] amazing
[00:54:31] okay you didn't you weren't supposed to
[00:54:33] kill him but that's okay you killed them
[00:54:34] you're banned and
[00:54:35] that's okay you killed him you're bad oh
[00:54:38] good
[00:54:39] I mean I'm sure it's tilting he's
[00:54:40] probably getting like grief through
[00:54:41] streams or something like I get it's
[00:54:43] probably [ __ ] like annoying as [ __ ]
[00:54:45] but it's funny
[00:55:02] you every stream I literally barely ban
[00:55:06] people except unironically the only time
[00:55:09] my moms have to work overtime are one of
[00:55:11] two things either one it's literally
[00:55:13] this day where as soon as the live
[00:55:15] stream starts we get like an influx of
[00:55:17] yours which I really appreciate but some
[00:55:20] people that aren't from the community
[00:55:21] don't know how to act for some reason
[00:55:23] and type some weird [ __ ] up [ __ ] that
[00:55:25] way off the Bad which isn't cool and
[00:55:27] then two is sometimes star rail viewers
[00:55:30] are just different I don't know why I
[00:55:32] don't know how I think it's because star
[00:55:34] real sometimes is just more Auto Battle
[00:55:36] and I can say less things so Chad
[00:55:38] doesn't really talk about me but
[00:55:39] sometimes one guy will say something
[00:55:41] weird and then chat just becomes that
[00:55:42] because Chad is slower I don't know
[00:55:45] but yeah
[00:55:48] let's just say I haven't checked my own
[00:55:49] band requests in a while
[00:55:52] also one of my mods made a bingo board I
[00:55:54] think big F made a bingo board for next
[00:55:56] time I do on band requests so that is
[00:55:58] something we could do how many do I have
[00:56:02] a check moderator
[00:56:04] whatever I don't know
[00:56:10] like Twitter DM I can say that later
[00:56:22] how many do I have we have
[00:56:30] 36 on Banner quests
[00:56:33] oh God
[00:56:34] I don't want to look at those requests
[00:56:36] oops I'm
[00:56:39] sorry that'll be content for whenever we
[00:56:41] do it
[00:56:43] but how bad are they surely then I
[00:56:45] thought okay I'll look at one I'll
[00:56:47] literally look at one surely they're not
[00:56:49] that bad right
[00:56:50] pop it out
[00:56:51] I'm not gonna do them today though I do
[00:56:53] not feel like it but surely they're not
[00:56:54] that bad
[00:57:07] um
[00:57:08] okay they're pretty bad
[00:57:18] I I like barely looked at them but
[00:57:24] yeah like what is happening bro
[00:57:40] ah
[00:57:42] like what is dude what are you doing
[00:57:48] I saw this from tarek's Channel
[00:57:57] I've watched her extreme nowhere has he
[00:58:00] ever
[00:58:02] that is not an uh
[00:58:09] 10 months when I was moving out of my
[00:58:12] act and I lost my streak on the Happy 10
[00:58:15] months
[00:58:20] oh
[00:58:22] why is it all HSR okay I think no flame
[00:58:25] to anyone because I actually like HSR I
[00:58:27] think some parts of the HSR Community is
[00:58:30] like old gentian like genshin Community
[00:58:32] well it's definitely has a lot of
[00:58:34] imperfections and a lot of weird people
[00:58:35] kind of evolved
[00:58:38] and I feel like stereo is starting from
[00:58:40] the starting point of genjin there's the
[00:58:42] same like Theory crafter Wars over dumb
[00:58:44] [ __ ] like play what the [ __ ] you
[00:58:45] want who the [ __ ] cares yeah there's
[00:58:47] something that's optimal but grow the
[00:58:48] [ __ ] up and then there's like the same
[00:58:50] people that are like waifuing like kid
[00:58:52] characters like you're weird you're dumb
[00:58:53] and then there's the same people that
[00:58:55] are like not funny there is so much of
[00:58:57] like the oh my God I actually can't I
[00:59:00] actually can't it's literally the start
[00:59:02] of the gadget community but with another
[00:59:04] game and it's just like
[00:59:06] but I mean I'm sure they'll catch up
[00:59:10] it's still a minority like most people
[00:59:12] are cool but you know
[00:59:43] I miss the soft Society like you to
[00:59:46] choose the name of the Miami
[00:59:57] [Music]
[00:59:57] um
[00:59:59] okay I got you I got you I got you okay
[01:00:01] hear me out hear me out okay okay uh
[01:00:03] okay I got you okay
[01:00:04] um
[01:00:10] balls cool it and then as many numbers
[01:00:14] as you can fit after
[01:00:16] wards
[01:00:22] and then you're gonna be a kaya maid
[01:00:26] okay how am I doing no damage what the
[01:00:28] [ __ ] is happening bro am I like am I
[01:00:30] dumb I don't know
[01:00:44] yeah I mean to be fair that's not the
[01:00:45] best like it's not the best content for
[01:00:47] nilu because it's like one enemy at a
[01:00:49] time uh so fair enough but yeah this
[01:00:51] could be good Loki
[01:00:54] let me go connect my resin you have no
[01:00:56] dendro yeah I mean we're playing this
[01:00:57] teams for a friendship nilu baiju and
[01:00:59] kurara are in front of 10. that's why
[01:01:01] we're playing it so like seven seven
[01:01:03] eight
[01:01:05] combination
[01:01:09] could go like French of 15
[01:01:11] glider French of 20 you got a custom
[01:01:13] skin French of 30 if they're if they're
[01:01:16] like if they're a select few characters
[01:01:18] they take their shirt off but they have
[01:01:20] to be a select character and you have to
[01:01:22] prove your age there's like an ID thing
[01:01:23] boom you're welcome you're welcome I
[01:01:25] just saved genjin
[01:01:30] friendship 50 Xiao takes everything off
[01:01:39] well I don't have [ __ ] butterflies
[01:01:42] thank you
[01:01:47] dude I was thinking what would be the
[01:01:49] worst like punishments to do for a
[01:01:50] challenge like other than just oh spend
[01:01:52] money and like literally dude imagine
[01:01:54] having to destroy like a hundred Crystal
[01:01:56] flies or imagine having to like dude
[01:01:59] imagine imagine having to imagine
[01:02:03] imagine
[01:02:07] having to destroy every thrilling Tales
[01:02:09] you every single thrilling Tales all the
[01:02:12] r ones all the r5s so I I don't have it
[01:02:15] I can't make anymore
[01:02:17] and then I have to get them back
[01:02:22] because it's not that bad like if you
[01:02:24] throw a five-star weapon it's like it
[01:02:26] hurts and it's kind of like it feels
[01:02:28] like throwing away money so it's like I
[01:02:29] don't yeah it kind of hurts but throwing
[01:02:31] away throwing tails is just like
[01:02:34] it's just like pain like you're gonna
[01:02:35] get them back eventually because it's a
[01:02:37] three star but it's like yeah
[01:02:45] they're easy to get yeah but also I look
[01:02:48] at how many I'm using right now
[01:02:50] well usually there's one on kokomi but
[01:02:53] one two I have three that are oh no I
[01:02:56] have more than three wait these are only
[01:02:57] some of the leveled uh
[01:03:00] no no I meant Mr ziox I had to
[01:03:03] accomplish wait is that it maybe I lied
[01:03:04] you have a four-year-old's t-shirt
[01:03:08] huh
[01:03:09] maybe I lied I have three equipped right
[01:03:11] now
[01:03:15] what's up hopefully there's a 300 this
[01:03:18] again do I pull for situ nahida or save
[01:03:19] for C6 Hydro archon do I pull for C to
[01:03:23] nahida or safe
[01:03:24] um wait a second what do you mean uh
[01:03:27] pull for Nikita her batter's not out
[01:03:29] what are you saying
[01:03:30] okay
[01:03:31] then if she does get a banner
[01:03:34] sauce
[01:03:38] it's a deal I mean I think the hydrocon
[01:03:40] looks really cool from what we know like
[01:03:42] I don't know her kid or anything I don't
[01:03:44] look at leaks but in terms of like what
[01:03:46] we saw in the trailer Falls like
[01:03:47] character looks sick so
[01:03:48] yeah
[01:03:50] but I also don't need like I don't think
[01:03:52] having a CC's character doesn't like
[01:03:54] fulfill me I don't know
[01:03:57] I think just having the characters cool

[01:06:46] today
[01:06:48] beg
[01:06:50] say open open
[01:06:59] whatever I don't know
[01:07:01] you are not welcome here
[01:07:10] in French bag is ring true the more you
[01:07:14] know
[01:07:18] you say different when you read the
[01:07:20] question yeah I think what I'm focused
[01:07:21] on the word I say it differently than
[01:07:23] what I normally say it
[01:07:25] which stronghold says
[01:07:29] oh I'm so glad you asked as to measure
[01:07:32] our new vid there's a short actually
[01:07:33] that doesn't really answer it well it
[01:07:35] kind of answers the two
[01:07:37] but I'm also making a video I'm gonna
[01:07:40] make a video on the new strong box but
[01:07:42] I'm sure there's gonna be new actual
[01:07:44] artifact set so I'm gonna wait till we
[01:07:45] know what the new sets and I'll make
[01:07:46] them both into one video with that in
[01:07:48] mind probably emblem
[01:07:51] for like 90 of people and millith to at
[01:07:54] least have one good set on your account
[01:07:55] maybe two maybe zero depends on who you
[01:07:57] play and then the other sets are like
[01:08:00] good but Niche so like if you mean like
[01:08:03] Ito or like you want to set for your
[01:08:05] Albedo you can go husk pale flame for
[01:08:07] like Eula [ __ ] uh like Vermillion for
[01:08:11] Xiao
[01:08:12] should like that right
[01:08:16] what's really nice about the strong box
[01:08:18] is that because emblem's there
[01:08:21] you might still want reminiscence this
[01:08:22] is not bad but you don't need to go
[01:08:24] reminisce anymore like if you don't want
[01:08:26] a minute if you want reminiscence Farm
[01:08:27] them of the vein if you don't want him
[01:08:28] in essence you get a strong box around
[01:08:30] them if you want to farm another set
[01:08:31] same with like Vermillion and Echoes
[01:08:33] right you might want one of the two but
[01:08:35] you probably don't want both like
[01:08:36] there's very few people that play like
[01:08:38] ayato and shot like I do but not that
[01:08:40] many people want both and are on good
[01:08:42] ping
[01:08:43] for icos that actually work so if you
[01:08:45] don't want both I'll have this then like
[01:08:47] you can just do one of them right
[01:08:57] oh
[01:09:04] she does French phrases for Fontan live
[01:09:06] stream
[01:09:08] that means like ah darn is this even

[01:09:16] oh I was on my [ __ ]
[01:09:19] drove Gilda Goblin with critical damage
[01:09:21] I'm not even kidding
[01:09:23] when we swap accounts we'll see
[01:09:43] is that
[01:09:45] in exactly two hours
[01:09:49] but we have a lot of [ __ ] to do first
[01:09:54] now I'm testing my patience

[01:10:02] the release a four-star Banner okay hear
[01:10:04] me out here let me cook right let me
[01:10:05] cook so a banner where instead of having
[01:10:08] a five star you you pull and it's like
[01:10:10] it's like you select a four star that's
[01:10:13] the the rate up four star it's like a
[01:10:15] custom four-star Banner okay and then
[01:10:17] it's like it's like it's like you pull
[01:10:18] it like down I want farazan Bennett
[01:10:20] singtel boom four star banner yeah
[01:10:23] there's no chance at a five star but
[01:10:25] really good odds out of four star
[01:10:26] character you want true trueing I would
[01:10:28] pull for that my free to play account
[01:10:29] because I don't I feel like if I pull
[01:10:31] for like five stars on it and then I
[01:10:33] just play five stars like if I play my
[01:10:35] favorite playground and I get nahida and
[01:10:36] kazua like it feels like cheating Loki

[01:17:29] I don't
[01:17:37] know what's happening chat
[01:17:39] whoa there's a plus four
[01:17:43] thanks blue
[01:17:50] what if I buy oh my God I'm a [ __ ]
[01:17:53] genius what if I buy a royal sword level
[01:17:56] one for our nilu because she's royalty
[01:17:59] and she deserves it
[01:18:01] and we never level it we just leave
[01:18:03] level one rose hold on nilu
[01:18:06] ah y'all let me cook wait I actually
[01:18:09] kind of want to do it
[01:18:13] she's not royalty yeah but she should be
[01:18:23] match though does it
[01:18:26] not I mean no it doesn't I mean this is
[01:18:29] the double blade I don't think Loki
[01:18:31] matches
[01:18:37] because she's a queen true actually
[01:18:50] imagine when you level it yeah but I the
[01:18:53] the whole point of my needle is having a
[01:18:54] I like level one weapon level one
[01:18:56] talents because it kind of makes nilu
[01:18:58] look better because she doesn't do none
[01:18:59] of these do anything so it's like it's
[01:19:01] more of a flex to play neither with
[01:19:02] nothing
[01:19:03] because she's literally just a passive
[01:19:05] like this is neither nilu is the chord
[01:19:07] of dancing pedals
[01:19:09] and this one I guess yeah I know this
[01:19:10] one too it's only just both of these
[01:19:20] okay I'm like Loki stalling because I
[01:19:23] don't know if I have time to record the
[01:19:26] Vermillion shot showcase today official
[01:19:28] wait till tomorrow I can't decide

[01:20:55] that is like no he's Australian he would
[01:20:57] look it up on YouTube because he uses
[01:20:59] YouTube and he would watch [ __ ]

[01:21:11] finally listen four months
[01:21:13] or file I can't believe this
[01:21:16] event like 120 to 140 but sometimes 160.
[01:21:19] it depends on your [ __ ] team but
[01:21:21] usually you go a bunch of Geo and then
[01:21:22] 120 140.
[01:21:32] Koreans use YouTube though LOL oh well I
[01:21:35] don't know if I
[01:21:37] why did someone tell me otherwise I
[01:21:38] don't know well maybe I just listened
[01:21:40] wrongly and that was my fault why is my
[01:21:42] why is
[01:21:54] wait my QR is not on four deepwood
[01:21:59] I mean it doesn't matter in this team
[01:22:01] but
[01:22:03] wait what what is happening
[01:22:07] oh I guess the feather's the wrong one
[01:22:14] um
[01:22:16] Chad can you imagine you see this

[01:23:05] in that team that's fine
[01:23:06] so assume you said no Hydro 5 Stars so
[01:23:10] that assume you have nahida so it would
[01:23:12] be nilu nahida Barbara and then whatever

[01:34:25] the only Banner I've ever skipped or the
[01:34:27] only Banner of a character I didn't have
[01:34:29] I've ever skipped was Clee cause I
[01:34:32] wasn't like I didn't make content back
[01:34:33] then and I like I pulled prevented by
[01:34:35] accident well like I like bendy but I
[01:34:37] wanted Fishel and I kept getting Barbara
[01:34:40] and Chang Ming on the first ever venti
[01:34:41] Banner so I got like five of each and I
[01:34:43] still didn't have venti so I still got

[01:35:12] bloggers
[01:35:15] foreign
[01:35:31] 's pretty good his Riptide is very very
[01:35:34] satisfying he's uh mostly insane with
[01:35:37] changling if you want to play
[01:35:38] cha-changling
[01:35:40] you don't have to but that is his best
[01:35:42] team that is also shangling's best team
[01:35:44] in my opinion
[01:35:49] what did I just
[01:35:51] what am I
[01:35:52] dude what am I doing one with wind and
[01:35:54] Cloud

[01:36:07] to make use of it

[01:36:54] you're not ready it's actually gonna
[01:36:56] happen
[01:36:58] ever seen one of these
[01:37:07] more like 2K the single hit scaling on
[01:37:11] her burst is actually relatively high if
[01:37:13] you melt it it could easily be over 100k
[01:37:15] it's just you're not supposed to like
[01:37:16] you're probably playing freeze you know
[01:37:18] I mean you probably don't play her but
[01:37:20] it's not the scaling that makes her bad
[01:37:30] wait how is my cooldown 35 seconds
[01:37:33] wait what's the highest cooldown I could
[01:37:35] have on this team
[01:37:37] maybe it's that it wasn't 35.

[01:44:47] know if I've ever had 10 million more
[01:44:48] before ever
[01:44:50] this is because we've had such little
[01:44:52] new characters I've actually been

[01:45:18] why is it now it's under 10 now
[01:45:20] TM is really good though that was
[01:45:22] probably the best house that we could
[01:45:22] have gone because em on wander very very
[01:45:25] good
[01:45:25] not the character but the set
[01:45:40] damn actually good every step 5 HP is
[01:45:43] good so as long as you don't find HP and
[01:45:44] I know that me saying that probably
[01:45:46] jinxed it
[01:45:47] um but as long as we don't get that then

[01:46:10] wait I actually get actually good
[01:46:18] no consumables found
[01:46:21] well that is awkward uh
[01:46:24] now it might be time to unlock some of
[01:46:27] the four stars but I kind of want to
[01:46:29] keep these
[01:46:34] because here's the thing okay here's
[01:46:36] actually okay I'm about to see something
[01:46:38] so smart you guys are about to ascend to
[01:46:40] a next plane of existence listen
[01:46:42] you soon we're gonna be able to
[01:46:44] strongbox Vermillion but you can't
[01:46:46] strong Box Five Star artifact or four
[01:46:48] star artifacts only five star so what is
[01:46:49] what's gonna be more rare isn't a good
[01:46:51] Vermillion piece it's gonna be these the
[01:46:53] four stars that show they're like scars
[01:46:55] of battle it shows my journey and the
[01:46:58] the evolution behind it it shows my
[01:47:01] progression okay this is what this shows
[01:47:04] it shows where I came from and I'm not
[01:47:06] gonna forget my humble beginnings so
[01:47:08] we're gonna keep these
[01:47:10] um with that said I have no artifact XP
[01:47:12] so I don't really know how I'm gonna
[01:47:14] level this piece
[01:47:16] um
[01:47:17] Zai zero X High
[01:47:22] unlock that dendril goblet it's
[01:47:23] literally not bad
[01:47:28] this one it's actually not bad nine
[01:47:30] percent crit rate means it's good for
[01:47:31] fav if you're playing a character who
[01:47:33] doesn't care about damage like denture
[01:47:34] MC you just slap this on or boom five
[01:47:36] boom
[01:47:41] why is that being copium it's not even
[01:47:43] bad it's really not even bad
[01:47:45] why did lonely Fanboy subscribe with

[01:58:14] not bad not bad not bad
[01:58:17] why is it hard to find a weapon for sure
[01:58:19] as a beginner go to the shop by
[01:58:20] blackliff pull even if you're free to
[01:58:22] play if you love Xiao you will save up
[01:58:24] your star glitter unless you need
[01:58:25] someone like saying show or something
[01:58:26] then just use White Castle or blacksmith
[01:58:28] not White Castle I lied you could
[01:58:29] blacksmith something did you buy the
[01:58:31] battle pass to use Deathmatch if you get
[01:58:32] a gotcha four star like five or lithic
[01:58:34] or even like any of the attackers at
[01:58:36] once you could use that
[01:58:40] but yeah if you don't have black Cliff
[01:58:42] it's kind of sad you can also there's a
[01:58:43] free to play one that's not bad what is
[01:58:45] it called uh well there's a freeblade
[01:58:47] event one the [ __ ] uh massive wind
[01:58:49] spear if you got it if you don't have it
[01:58:51] unlucky
[01:58:52] wow
[01:58:59] is the catch good yes for sure no
[01:59:06] consider shangling
[01:59:10] if I die 600
[01:59:12] I almost had 600 gifted
[01:59:14] yeah nice try
[01:59:27] I might actually die here so I gotta be
[01:59:31] careful
[01:59:36] fun fact the child players
[01:59:38] if you want a normal Castle into a punch
[01:59:40] you can Plus throwback at the same time
[01:59:42] see you look and then another attack
[01:59:44] went off
[01:59:46] oh
[01:59:48] we're fine let me heal
[01:59:57] didn't ask okay well I'll try to be
[02:00:00] helpful
[02:00:01] conquering
[02:00:03] here
[02:00:07] because a lot of like newer shot players
[02:00:09] they'll laugh if they try to normal
[02:00:10] attack cancel funds they miss plunges so
[02:00:13] if you want to get it right you Mouse as
[02:00:15] you jump same click
[02:00:21] or if you're like me and are resinless
[02:00:23] and have to fidget with something and
[02:00:25] run around you'll naturally uh practice
[02:00:27] canceling things perfectly so you'll
[02:00:29] know how to normal cancel by just
[02:00:31] because you do it so much Michelle but
[02:00:32] this is the timing for shouting operator
[02:00:33] but
[02:00:42] [ __ ] I actually need particles
[02:00:53] whatever
[02:00:59] seen one of these
[02:01:06] ever seen one of these

[02:01:26] takes the twenty dollars away I
[02:01:27] appreciate it but I think you got the
[02:01:29] wrong I appreciate it
[02:01:36] I want to use alloy whatever I can't I'm
[02:01:38] just gonna kill them
[02:01:45] thank you for the Sova lineups no

[02:02:21] to dodge Only Time to Kill
[02:02:32] yeah
[02:02:34] because all you have to that's why you
[02:02:35] just jump push out just jump
[02:02:57] I have to sneeze can you guys
[02:02:59] preemptively say bless you thanks
[02:03:17] dude does sneezing have an ICD because I
[02:03:20] feel like once you miss your first
[02:03:21] chance there's like a certain amount of
[02:03:22] cooldown before it comes again
[02:03:32] okay
[02:03:34] I need energy
[02:03:45] yeah
[02:03:48] is that all you've got
[02:03:50] pounded to the ground

[02:04:30] [Music]
[02:04:33] this is a new one
[02:04:36] dude Ayla is actually the carry no one
[02:04:38] else no one else
[02:04:42] true
[02:04:48] are they adding alloy cons at 4.0 yes so
[02:04:50] my guess is that every PS5 you buy is an
[02:04:54] Eloy cons whether it's sixth one
[02:04:56] basically making her a gone you but four
[02:04:58] times better
[02:05:05] every time Eloy uses her skill at C6
[02:05:08] it'll summon it'll summon a Nikita on
[02:05:11] field to attack with you and apply
[02:05:13] dendro
[02:05:14] and when you burst on Eloy what it
[02:05:16] actually will do is uh when you burst
[02:05:19] it'll it'll set a field and with a bunch
[02:05:22] of cryo mines and anytime an enemy walks
[02:05:24] on it they get Frozen and they take uh
[02:05:27] uh damage when they get unfrozen equal
[02:05:29] to fifty percent of their HP
[02:05:35] true
[02:05:36] okay floor 12.
[02:05:42] uh we could play Albert second half
[02:05:52] of the eye

[02:17:52] cleared faster this way we actually
[02:17:54] threw faster watch

[02:18:06] and then we and then we
[02:18:15] that was terrible
[02:18:16] but we got it doesn't matter it wasn't
[02:18:19] even bad I didn't do anything bad but
[02:18:21] yeah I died
[02:18:26] I missed a sock she's very squishy gear
[02:18:29] in my life she did okay damage so she's
[02:18:31] probably geared well and ready to obtain
[02:18:33] a doctorate in advanced Neuroscience
[02:18:36] thank you
[02:18:38] you're welcome
[02:18:40] she'd want to be on gilded though not
[02:18:42] tutu but it's fine
[02:19:02] show C6 as far as on build uh it's not
[02:19:04] really a build
[02:19:06] he's just on middle fav
[02:19:10] speaking of which I think it's about
[02:19:11] [ __ ] time we actually level our fires
[02:19:13] on she's still not ascended by the way
[02:19:14] because I don't feel like getting Hannah
[02:19:16] berries did I can you blame me I dude I
[02:19:20] don't care about bear like I farmed the
[02:19:22] boss I don't want to get the berries man
[02:19:30] why don't you activate Collins I
[02:19:32] actually Four Star cons five stars of
[02:19:34] Defense
[02:19:36] it's just because they're not toggleable
[02:19:37] like I kind of I don't I don't know I
[02:19:39] wish they were talkable
[02:19:56] artifacts uh where is she
[02:20:01] don't know if it doesn't really matter
[02:20:03] what like if you're not C6 literally if
[02:20:06] you're not C6 you filter by energy
[02:20:07] recharge and whatever the first one that
[02:20:10] pops up is what you use it doesn't
[02:20:11] matter it literally doesn't matter but
[02:20:12] if you're a C6 then you could go like an
[02:20:15] emo crit if you can you still need a lot
[02:20:18] of ER but not as much
[02:20:32] I should probably 90 my MC right and
[02:20:34] doesn't matter
[02:20:36] is there someone at wanna 90 before
[02:20:38] Fontan

[02:32:55] [ __ ] zip it the rest is ugly
[02:33:23] and for some reason I can't do yolon
[02:33:25] shangling so we could do like

[02:33:32] we don't have a Healer but I don't think
[02:33:34] we need one okay we probably need one

[02:44:20] oh your shot might be okay your shot
[02:44:22] might be a bit shorter it's still tall
[02:44:23] but a bit shorter because you probably
[02:44:25] didn't play him enough so his
[02:44:26] friendship's not maxed so yeah it's a
[02:44:29] common misunderstanding uh people a lot
[02:44:31] of people make that mistakes
[02:44:33] stats at the third swing during casting
[02:44:36] and will not be affected by changes in
[02:44:38] her stats that occur afterwards once a

[02:48:10] in the middle about
[02:48:16] okay why are these guys actually do a
[02:48:18] lot of damage I don't think this event
[02:48:19] was gonna be hard
[02:48:22] okay we're running back
[02:48:28] same team that was just a mere issue of
[02:48:31] skill actually he didn't really do much
[02:48:33] there
[02:48:36] uh
[02:48:40] uh yeah let's do this
[02:48:57] why are you still get knocked so far
[02:48:58] away
[02:49:12] rain outlines your face it's probably
[02:49:16] better not hide them on deep foot
[02:49:17] actually
[02:49:18] think about that until now
[02:49:27] Consciousness is actually stored in the
[02:49:29] balls
[02:49:30] why our Consciousness is not stored in
[02:49:34] I'm trying to hear that
[02:49:37] let me leave you at first
[02:49:45] that's it yeah we were playing a uh a
[02:49:48] dendro hyperbloom a dendro and hyperloom
[02:49:50] team with no deep wood
[02:49:52] so I should use nahida and not a hyphen
[02:49:55] I also can't even charge that okay I
[02:49:56] just said
[02:50:05] um our damage should be like about
[02:50:06] double but it's fine
[02:50:13] okay we got him
[02:50:18] I don't want to talk about that okay
[02:50:19] round three
[02:50:21] uh this is these guys are annoying but
[02:50:24] we'll be fine what is our Buffs
[02:50:27] first damage yeah just burst damage
[02:50:30] should probably do right in battle my
[02:50:31] ride's not geared so we'll do like
[02:50:35] okay burst damage is completely useless
[02:50:36] on ciao so we're gonna play ciao
[02:50:39] um with farzan Bennett and then
[02:50:43] because he's cool
[02:50:55] you guys are [ __ ] tanky
[02:50:58] you are not welcome here here

[02:51:14] [ __ ] killer man we got it last time

[02:51:23] remember what happened two seconds ago
[02:51:25] like I'll say a sentence and then when I

[02:51:28] what my first sentence was
[02:51:45] you haven't slapped okay true but I also
[02:51:48] am like that even when I have slept
[02:51:50] so uh aware
[02:51:52] that's not an excuse

[02:52:26] well it is time to dentro it up
[02:52:30] but we should start with a non-dendro
[02:52:33] because we're gonna need our dendro for

[03:07:36] for the Sinners The Curtain Call has
[03:07:39] come
[03:07:45] on where's the drowning
[03:07:47] ladies and gentlemen she did it
[03:07:50] magicians seeing is believing my friends
[03:07:54] this has been Lenny and Lynette's magic
[03:07:56] show
[03:07:59] so I was ready yes but the essence of
[03:08:02] magic is getting people to believe alive
[03:08:04] and the most important part of this is
[03:08:07] what people see
[03:08:12] people don't realize how much they
[03:08:15] expect their eyes to tell them the truth
[03:08:21] but what you see is not real yeah but
[03:08:25] French hello it's all a show
[03:08:28] hey
[03:08:33] file characters
[03:08:35] [Music]
[03:08:40] [Applause]
[03:08:42] the right place
[03:08:49] oh no nevermind
[03:08:52] [Applause]
[03:08:53] whoever controls everything
[03:08:58] you might be able to turn things to your
[03:09:00] advantage
[03:09:02] each time
[03:09:06] go in and I though in my opinion in a
[03:09:11] nutshell magic is what you see with your
[03:09:13] own two eyes
[03:09:15] [Music]
[03:09:16] [Applause]
[03:09:16] [Music]
[03:09:23] very fun
[03:09:25] but it's not enough
[03:09:30] let me make something clear you think of
[03:09:33] yourselves as magicians but when you're
[03:09:36] on the stage your first and foremost
[03:09:38] actors
[03:09:39] good actors holding their
[03:09:42] craft to Mesmerize the whole crowd
[03:09:52] if she's playable
[03:09:55] [Music]
[03:10:01] we will be crowning her
[03:10:05] did I hope they make like evil photos

[04:28:07] is the tier three as a privacy
[04:28:15] oh yeah we also don't know about Hydro
[04:28:16] Traveler
[04:28:17] damn I have so many questions I mean I
[04:28:19] guess I'll just figure it out when 4.0
[04:28:20] is out but or maybe even before the
[04:28:22] announce I don't know
[04:28:32] [ __ ] YouTube chat what is happening
[04:28:38] okay I won't
[04:28:48] oh I mean I was still [ __ ] hyped
[04:28:50] about that I don't like I'm still really
[04:28:52] high I'm just like I look question now
[04:28:53] because it's like I was expecting to
[04:28:55] like be able to like math or like not
[04:28:57] mad but like count something out of like
[04:28:59] see what's good on who and [ __ ] like
[04:29:00] that but other than that like everything
[04:29:03] looks super [ __ ] hype so I am excited
[04:29:09] but the magic begins this is so loud
[04:29:15] therefore you would be wise to tell
[04:29:18] everything you know and seek the
[04:29:20] protection of the Gods dear God it's a
[04:29:23] whole Army of garments I believe this is
[04:29:27] indeed the finale

[04:39:04] recap of this three on a second trial

[04:39:13] Madge Madge
[04:39:16] I saw just cause that to do on kitchen

[04:39:33] dumb
[04:39:36] um
[04:39:38] yeah I'm gonna have to do the Vermilion
[04:39:41] thing later there's a million stream
[04:39:42] next stream

[04:39:45] years today guys I know it's for the
[04:39:47] live stream but I appreciate you guys
[04:39:50] um if you're new feel free to follow you
[04:39:52] can subscribe for free with prime you
[04:39:53] can join the description oh shut up I'll
[04:39:54] shut the [ __ ] up uh with that said I
[04:39:56] don't know is there anything else I need
[04:39:57] to do anything else I should watch or am
[04:39:59] I vegging because I didn't sleep last
[04:40:00] night
[04:40:02] he tracked 344 what is 344.
[04:40:06] I am suspicious of this
[04:40:09] you gotta be kidding
[04:40:13] what ether charges have now been
[04:40:18] what happened
[04:40:20] charges have now been pressed Parker a
[04:40:24] trial is in order therefore you would be
[04:40:26] wise to tell everything you know and
[04:40:29] seek the protection of the guards God
[04:40:32] it's a whole Army of guardamax I believe
[04:40:35] this is indeed the finale
[04:40:39] your so-called Justice
[04:40:44] deny to the suffering of the people in
[04:40:46] your eyes the value of a human life is
[04:40:49] nothing compared to those cold laws you
[04:40:51] hold so dear
[04:40:55] damn
[04:40:57] so this is how Justice is done in
[04:40:59] Fontaine what a joke
[04:41:03] you've got your rules
[04:41:06] dude Charlie imagine electric child is
[04:41:08] playable
[04:41:15] well I've got mine too
[04:41:27] would do anything
[04:41:35] this mask is ugly really yeah that's
[04:41:37] cool
[04:41:39] he laments he turns into a [ __ ] child
[04:41:41] he said Lament
[04:41:44] child's vision is gone yeah because he's
[04:41:47] delusion
[04:41:49] so this is how Justice is done in
[04:41:51] Fontaine what a joke well it's normally
[04:41:54] there right so this is how like there's
[04:41:56] something there it's not it's done in
[04:41:58] Fontaine what a joke
[04:42:01] you've got your rules
[04:42:04] it's either it's either here or waste I
[04:42:06] don't know
[04:42:08] I waste okay yeah
[04:42:10] there
[04:42:14] I see
[04:42:17] okay well I must badge uh I don't know
[04:42:20] what the [ __ ] I'm uploading a video
[04:42:21] today but I don't know which one I'm
[04:42:22] uploading because if there was new
[04:42:24] something I would have made that video
[04:42:26] first
[04:42:27] but if not I was probably gonna upload
[04:42:29] my Beto guide or something
[04:42:31] because I want to upload a video now
[04:42:33] because I haven't been uploading enough
[04:42:34] and I want a hashtag ad so I like I
[04:42:37] wanted to do something new so it's like

[04:44:51] so
[04:44:54] I have like I'm gonna upload a video
[04:44:57] with like a 30 second hashtag ad of a
[04:44:59] game that I've actually played so I was
[04:45:00] like you know might as well do it but I
[04:45:02] was gonna do it on something that's new
[04:45:03] but if there's because I don't normally
[04:45:05] put I never put an ad in like a guide
[04:45:07] video but if they didn't I expected to
[04:45:09] announce something new and if they don't
[04:45:10] I'll have to put in like the beta video
[04:45:11] which is kind of weird but whatever I
