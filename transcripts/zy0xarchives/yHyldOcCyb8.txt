[00:00:02] weeklies I have resin I have
[00:00:04] maidens no I don't I don't
[00:00:09] anyways I have a lot to do but I think
[00:00:12] we start
[00:00:13] with the biggest chore of them all which
[00:00:17] is
[00:00:18] finish naming our scaramuki we're gonna
[00:00:21] very quickly very so last stream we did
[00:00:24] 99.999 of the archon Quest for scarra I
[00:00:28] think today we finish it very fast name
[00:00:30] our Wanderer and then we uh you know
[00:00:33] spend resin we get Christmas luck we
[00:00:35] also have to do an abyss clear today oh
[00:00:36] what a Biz clear I need a hyperbloom
[00:00:39] ayato clear for my video and I also need
[00:00:41] a ride
[00:00:44] fun with this gift
[00:00:49] a ride in shogunclear for the video
[00:00:51] after that so we're going to be doing
[00:00:52] both of those in today's stream also
[00:00:54] spending resin also reacting to content
[00:00:56] a lot of [ __ ] to do a lot of [ __ ] to do
[00:00:58] but we're gonna start by naming our
[00:01:00] Wanderer because I've been wanting to do
[00:01:01] it
[00:01:02] uh and last stream you might have
[00:01:03] remembered you might have recalled let
[00:01:05] me pause this music you might have
[00:01:06] recalled our Quest pymon
[00:01:08] if you say one more word or someone
[00:01:13] last stream I gave you my heart and the
[00:01:17] very next day you gave it away
[00:01:22] okay
[00:01:24] last time we're doing the Arkham Quest
[00:01:26] and it got interrupted by toddler Tales
[00:01:28] like maybe like sucks who the [ __ ]
[00:01:30] hasn't done toddler Tales I don't even
[00:01:31] remember that well like doing that
[00:01:32] that's how long ago was listen when
[00:01:34] Inazuma came out I was busy okay uh the
[00:01:37] thing is I have to make an ayat ayaka
[00:01:39] guide so I stayed up making an ayaka
[00:01:41] guide also this is NPC dialogue so
[00:01:43] that's why and that's what happened and
[00:01:45] then one thing led to another and
[00:01:46] eventually sumeru came out and then
[00:01:48] sumru as you know I've already fully
[00:01:50] explored Inazuma was a different time
[00:01:54] so you can understand
[00:01:56] the one was just they say he was um
[00:02:00] anyway
[00:02:02] [Music]
[00:02:04] too much going on no no listen here's
[00:02:06] the plan we start by finishing this
[00:02:08] Quest we're almost done I think name our
[00:02:10] Wanderer then dailies and weeklies then
[00:02:13] Abyss no yes Abyss clear once then
[00:02:18] react Andy to a few videos I found then
[00:02:21] spend resin on either emblem or
[00:02:23] Vermilion depending on if I'm smart or
[00:02:25] stupid then

[00:02:31] done the mouse what do you mean what do
[00:02:34] you mean is this actually I thought we

[00:02:38] reject my outfit takes his clothes off
[00:02:40] naked then we we win that's the end of

[00:08:37] is there something you need to tell me
[00:08:42] wait oh my God I just remember something
[00:08:44] okay chat chat chat this is important
[00:08:46] you know how nahida when she holds e she
[00:08:48] can read people's minds right Ruby these
[00:08:50] are five guys I appreciate it you know
[00:08:51] when Nikita holds e she can reads
[00:08:53] people's minds right what if she does
[00:08:55] that on the traveler and then the
[00:08:57] traveler was thinking about greater
[00:08:59] greater Lord Ruka Nevada does the Hira
[00:09:02] then have a holy [ __ ] moment remember it
[00:09:04] and then kolei gets [ __ ] Al's alzahar
[00:09:08] the disease again and then Cole dies
[00:09:11] does that happen
[00:09:13] damn
[00:09:15] damn
[00:09:25] I know I know the Traveler's not from
[00:09:26] tevat but that'd be funny
[00:09:28] what if traveler whispered it into
[00:09:30] existence what if what if Travelers what
[00:09:33] if she was sleep talking whatever the
[00:09:35] means sleep talked and said the word
[00:09:36] greater Lord Ruka devada and then the
[00:09:39] Hira heard it or anyone literally anyone
[00:09:41] what if pymon heard
[00:09:43] Coley dies
[00:09:46] anyways
[00:09:53] uh I'm the someone who remembers of
[00:09:54] things I release I'm The Record Keeper
[00:09:56] kokomi fan
[00:09:58] what's wrong
[00:10:00] only I can remember these things I have
[00:10:03] oh no
[00:10:04] oh no
[00:10:06] I have to tell you the truth
[00:10:08] with a heavy heart you piece back
[00:10:09] together destroy those broken and
[00:10:10] Scattered across time wait what well I
[00:10:12] guess okay this is just the scar of
[00:10:13] stuff it's fine
[00:10:17] wait I feel like yeah you can tell
[00:10:19] Nikita about this right it doesn't
[00:10:20] matter you just can't tell about the
[00:10:21] greater Lord if you tell her about the
[00:10:22] greater Lord Gigi everyone dies
[00:10:24] literally they bring back the cancer
[00:10:25] that was removed but now it's like this
[00:10:27] is fine
[00:10:28] after a series of events in Tara tutsumi
[00:10:31] the balladeer thinking he had been
[00:10:33] Thrice betrayed left Inazuma to roam the
[00:10:36] world Beyond
[00:10:37] with no thrust with no trust for humans
[00:10:41] and only loathing for the gods he bore
[00:10:44] his Grudge for years as he grew in
[00:10:46] strength then returned to Inazuma to
[00:10:49] take his revenge
[00:10:52] finally an attempt to reverse his tragic
[00:10:55] fate
[00:10:57] quite a story
[00:10:59] so this puppet known as the balladeer
[00:11:02] yeah erased himself in Urban Soul yeah
[00:11:06] yeah
[00:11:08] but
[00:11:09] how is he even able to do that as the
[00:11:12] traveler said he very nearly became
[00:11:14] samira's deity
[00:11:17] admittedly I remember it a little
[00:11:20] differently
[00:11:21] I don't recall finding anyone inside
[00:11:24] them wait why don't we put scarra on a
[00:11:26] leash if we knew he had the power to do
[00:11:28] something stupid
[00:11:30] why don't we just put him on a leash
[00:11:32] what are you guys acting like it's weird
[00:11:33] yolan's done it
[00:11:35] yes it does make sense
[00:11:37] if someone were to success
[00:11:41] the world would change to reflect the
[00:11:44] new reality so you
[00:11:46] you was person really existed yeah yes
[00:11:49] theoretically speaking it is possible to
[00:11:51] do this traveler comes from a world
[00:11:53] Beyond to that
[00:11:55] that's why there's no information about
[00:11:57] her and Irma
[00:11:59] and it also explains why any changes to
[00:12:01] Urban Soul wouldn't affect her true so
[00:12:04] if there's anyone in the world capable
[00:12:06] of retaining memories from a past that
[00:12:08] has been Rewritten it's you
[00:12:11] it's my mom's having a hard time
[00:12:13] understanding that I can only make
[00:12:15] inferences based on the information
[00:12:17] we've been given
[00:12:19] as for what kind of person he was okay I
[00:12:22] feel like this entire cut scene we
[00:12:23] already knew but fair enough I'm not
[00:12:25] really sure
[00:12:26] we were enemies I don't know if we
[00:12:27] started okay cool
[00:12:30] wait we literally know why he was like
[00:12:32] [ __ ] this I'm dipping [ __ ] everything
[00:12:34] new identity
[00:12:37] I still remember the question he asked
[00:12:39] he asked me specifically and my
[00:12:40] hesitation gave him the answer I
[00:12:42] hesitated because I witnessed the
[00:12:43] greater Lord who could have ought to
[00:12:44] erase her own existence and I can't but
[00:12:45] I can't tell him the heat of that
[00:12:54] something that you can't share
[00:12:58] okay I couldn't change the fate of the
[00:13:01] ones who had died right yes once the
[00:13:03] balladeer realized he hasn't been
[00:13:05] betrayed after all
[00:13:07] right
[00:13:17] and if he thought there was a chance he
[00:13:20] could save his old friends it would be
[00:13:23] hard not to try
[00:13:27] oh that's
[00:13:33] God
[00:13:37] retain the power to connect with
[00:13:39] Herman's song okay cool
[00:13:42] one year with the funniest most
[00:13:44] entertaining humble handsome cutest and
[00:13:47] tallest chat ever
[00:13:49] and Mr socks
[00:13:52] and get a second chance those faded to
[00:13:54] the tragic end could not be saved what
[00:13:55] exactly do you want to fight against the
[00:13:57] betrayals in his life I really wish you
[00:13:58] never existed at all wow
[00:14:01] found it
[00:14:03] not even using things in Prime hippo
[00:14:05] collector thanks to the year hopefully
[00:14:06] you don't make it to 13 months because
[00:14:07] that's a waste of money and surely
[00:14:09] you're like okay I wasted 12 months
[00:14:11] worth of money I'm gonna stop before 13
[00:14:12] but I know you probably won't do that so
[00:14:15] thank you in advance for 13 months
[00:14:19] it was tucked away in the corner you
[00:14:22] should take a look
[00:14:24] how old is this surprising the
[00:14:26] information is presentation away there's
[00:14:27] almost a fairy tale
[00:14:29] is this fairy tale I authored this
[00:14:33] record myself hey what the [ __ ] I'm lost
[00:14:35] narrative
[00:14:38] clear that this story is an allegory
[00:14:41] everything in it is a symbol for
[00:14:43] something else
[00:14:45] well done so this record survived from
[00:14:48] food
[00:14:51] yes
[00:14:53] any information about the balladeer or
[00:14:55] the Kabuki mono and other records will
[00:14:57] have been changed but I wrote this story
[00:15:00] in a way that means it was left intact
[00:15:02] wow changing the information in Urban
[00:15:05] Soul changes to that
[00:15:07] that Urban Soul can't change information
[00:15:09] that was well hidden in advance all
[00:15:11] right Chad you guys must behave you are
[00:15:12] now in r9k mode
[00:15:14] soul
[00:15:20] oh you'll be in unique traveled actually
[00:15:21] and something
[00:15:24] that's probably the same thing
[00:15:27] oh my God I knew she'd remember
[00:15:29] everything
[00:15:30] this story is abstract enough that it
[00:15:33] still resonates with the present
[00:15:34] information recorded in Urban Soul but
[00:15:37] if we connect all the different pieces
[00:15:39] together the true story that emerges is
[00:15:42] the one she told us
[00:15:43] the now erased life of the balladeer
[00:15:47] wait that's kind of five head
[00:15:50] wait what the [ __ ] did he not wait
[00:15:52] [Music]
[00:16:01] and they became friends
[00:16:03] the monster lived with the family Dan's
[00:16:06] Nate and everyone treated it as one of
[00:16:09] their own
[00:16:10] once in a while the monster would take
[00:16:13] off its Fox for his night and lament to
[00:16:16] itself as it gazed wait momentum
[00:16:19] I am a monstrosity dude I thought I was
[00:16:23] hearing things I was like no way she
[00:16:24] said that I have to look at the chest of
[00:16:25] the [ __ ] chat
[00:16:28] the monster soon found solace when
[00:16:31] another oh is that scarra but cat
[00:16:38] s who had been abandoned by the humans
[00:16:41] the kitten too
[00:16:44] but its tail was too slender and it
[00:16:47] could not grow a coat of richly colored
[00:16:49] fur if I shot isn't responding yes when
[00:16:52] the other foxes saw this they spoke
[00:16:54] words of comfort to the kitten
[00:16:57] even without a tail and fur like ours yo
[00:17:00] my pieces actually [ __ ]
[00:17:04] furious at this happy resolution the
[00:17:07] monster lit a fire on the mountain
[00:17:10] the terrified animals panicked as the
[00:17:12] fire spread
[00:17:14] the only way to extinguish the Flames
[00:17:16] was to make a sacrifice
[00:17:18] a gray fox stood up and addressed the
[00:17:21] monster it said you are the cleverest
[00:17:25] Among Us surely you can help us the way
[00:17:29] they lamented into Among Us the monsters
[00:17:32] let the fox toward the fire there's no
[00:17:35] way and murdered it
[00:17:38] the gray Fox's heart was turned into a
[00:17:41] beautiful Drop of water
[00:17:42] clear
[00:17:43] spotless and pure
[00:17:47] okay guys I don't know how to show you

[00:19:11] creature nor a single blade of grass
[00:19:13] that stood on that mountain
[00:19:15] the kitten spent the nights wandering
[00:19:18] aimlessly gnashing its teeth at the Moon
[00:19:21] where's the part where Scarab burns his
[00:19:24] house down for dying true how dare my
[00:19:26] friend die

[00:20:33] Moon wait what the [ __ ] is this POV then
[00:20:35] no one will know that there were once
[00:20:37] Birds foxes and cats in this world
[00:20:41] and no one can know that they were
[00:20:43] different
[00:20:47] hmm
[00:20:51] we solved it
[00:20:53] yeah we surely pymon
[00:20:56] I remember now
[00:20:59] this is not just the balleter story
[00:21:02] it is his very own memories
[00:21:05] wait she made a backup so that it would
[00:21:07] be preserved wait that's got a five head
[00:21:09] wait how do you do that you're gonna
[00:21:11] save it on a hard drive experience
[00:21:13] and modify
[00:21:18] torture
[00:21:21] that he was a puppet this memory was
[00:21:24] extracted from him by the scholars
[00:21:27] presumably they kept it to have
[00:21:29] something to defend themselves with okay
[00:21:35] we wanted to be able to control it
[00:21:38] yeah he was actually a hacker
[00:21:41] [Music]
[00:21:45] sorry so that it wouldn't be altered I
[00:21:47] feel like I'm wasting how hyped this
[00:21:48] Quest is like it's hype but I just want
[00:21:49] to get to the point where I can call
[00:21:51] scarra the name that I have in mind that
[00:21:52] I can't do that Sleek it more than one
[00:21:56] occasion Hyman has no memory of him at
[00:21:58] all shut up I'm on no one asked you
[00:22:02] oh my God I just realized okay you guys
[00:22:04] know the
[00:22:05] comedic relief in every show like in
[00:22:07] Hunter Hunter it's like [ __ ] Leorio
[00:22:09] right you guys know the [ __ ] comic
[00:22:10] relief comedic relief that's like funny
[00:22:12] but he also like reminds you of [ __ ]
[00:22:13] like you forgot or whatever right pymon
[00:22:16] is like the comedic relief of gentian if
[00:22:18] the comedic relief was never funny and
[00:22:20] also didn't give good information ever
[00:22:22] but just reminded you of things in case
[00:22:24] you fell asleep that I just solved time
[00:22:26] on I just realized what the point of
[00:22:28] time on was it's like a comedic relief
[00:22:30] but they forgot the comedic part so it's
[00:22:32] just relief but since it's not funny it
[00:22:34] doesn't relieve you and instead you want
[00:22:35] to relieve Yourself by being the [ __ ]
[00:22:36] out of the stupid creature good take
[00:22:38] before he vanished I didn't say that I
[00:22:40] would never do that
[00:22:50] she's great I don't like pymon but I not
[00:22:53] to that extent
[00:23:03] oh yeah this is the [ __ ] I saw people
[00:23:05] talking about okay I didn't know it's
[00:23:06] from this Quest
[00:23:09] actually maybe not I guess nahida just
[00:23:11] reminded it
[00:23:13] guys be sure to jump scare your friends
[00:23:15] that are into lore by asking them about
[00:23:17] the fatoui rankings
[00:23:19] make the make them have a quick mental
[00:23:22] breakdown all right anyways uh I've
[00:23:24] never seen before it feels like life is
[00:23:26] an insignificant as a feather
[00:23:28] [Music]
[00:23:33] man doesn't like the way it all ended
[00:23:36] that much better
[00:23:37] this is why wisdom alone cannot answer
[00:23:39] all our questions
[00:23:41] we look we see and we comprehend but the
[00:23:45] question still troubles us oh so the
[00:23:49] answer is not everything
[00:23:50] people yearn to find the truth and then
[00:23:53] conquer the troubles they face when you
[00:23:55] give someone the truth you give them a
[00:23:58] chance dude she's such a motivational
[00:23:59] speaker I think she's a stream viewer
[00:24:01] like she probably watches Alex
[00:24:08] playlist

[00:26:37] it's simply not possible for the ballot
[00:26:38] you're completely racism existence in
[00:26:39] which case the question is what happened
[00:26:40] to him

[00:27:37] yourself get distracted true I don't
[00:27:39] want to take advantage so I'm happy to

[00:27:43] you keep acting like this pretty soon I
[00:27:46] won't be able to afford to that's pretty

[00:34:53] hello
[00:34:54] I do apologize for the sudden intrusion
[00:34:57] thumb why is he nice now
[00:35:02] you tell lesser Lord kuzanali what
[00:35:04] happened in the Grand Bazaar say that
[00:35:07] you are trekking across to that to train
[00:35:09] yourself
[00:35:12] many other emails who describe
[00:35:14] themselves in this way call themselves
[00:35:17] suganja
[00:35:19] he's nice now yeah it's actually nice
[00:35:21] now well it seems more relevant in my
[00:35:24] case
[00:35:25] to me it sounds like a plan you got a
[00:35:28] therapist
[00:35:30] but these two claim that they know me
[00:35:32] and that I have a hidden past unknown
[00:35:34] even to myself I wouldn't call it to the
[00:35:38] past but rather
[00:35:42] frasbling
[00:35:44] I don't like to rely on using terms like
[00:35:46] this often but in your case it seems
[00:35:51] that it ought to be called uh yes
[00:35:59] something far more distant than the past
[00:36:02] so far away that you cannot perceive it
[00:36:05] okay I have to ask oh oh what was I like
[00:36:10] in my previous
[00:36:12] derogatory tell them say it just say it
[00:36:15] you were a xiaomi
[00:36:19] if you want to tell me
[00:36:21] but you can't bring yourselves to say it
[00:36:24] looks like I didn't have the most
[00:36:25] wonderful existence in my previous
[00:36:27] Incarnation we were just trying to think
[00:36:29] where to start it's that difficult to
[00:36:31] talk about
[00:36:32] I have no doubt it will be just as
[00:36:34] difficult to hear but I'll be able to
[00:36:36] handle it
[00:36:37] please
[00:36:38] tell me the truth is truth something you
[00:36:41] care a lot about
[00:36:42] yes
[00:36:44] the
[00:36:46] then I'll be straight with you in your
[00:36:49] previous Incarnation you did many things
[00:36:52] that would be considered evil you've
[00:36:54] already died because of what other
[00:36:56] people did then why does zai zero X look
[00:37:00] like that woman from the movie Basic
[00:37:02] Instinct is about to open up his legs to
[00:37:05] show us wait what are you saying I
[00:37:08] cannot look that up I don't know what
[00:37:09] you just said but [ __ ] you
[00:37:13] eight months
[00:37:17] dude imagine if
[00:37:23] you're able you adamantly believed that
[00:37:25] you were missing a heart
[00:37:31] actions rooted in persistence sometimes
[00:37:33] bear bitter fruit
[00:37:36] sometimes you have to let parts of
[00:37:38] yourself go or you'll never be happy
[00:37:43] wait Chad you know the Tori you know how
[00:37:45] the Tori can like can like give

[00:38:17] wrong
[00:38:17] each choice a person makes belongs to a
[00:38:20] specific place and time a chain of cause
[00:38:23] and effect
[00:38:24] a cycle of Karma and consequence
[00:38:28] is the nature of Truth dude what nahida
[00:38:32] I love you but why are you explaining
[00:38:35] truth if one thing is right the opposite
[00:38:37] must be how can someone win if winning
[00:38:40] means that someone loses does anyone
[00:38:42] actually win how how can win

[00:49:10] whoa whoa what is that angle
[00:49:15] from admit it but you are a part of this
[00:49:18] plan
[00:49:19] perhaps you find fighting in the abyss
[00:49:21] to be a more meaningful use of your time
[00:49:25] oh but of course even this pales in
[00:49:28] comparison to being experimented on by
[00:49:31] the doctor
[00:49:33] um
[00:49:35] what a sharp tongue you have
[00:49:38] funny how negotiating never seems to be
[00:49:41] your strong suit for the task ahead I
[00:49:44] suggest you keep your true feelings to
[00:49:46] yourself
[00:49:50] save your breath I know what I have to
[00:49:53] do

[00:49:59] then he foreshadowed it don't let your
[00:50:01] emotions he literally just said don't

[00:50:37] here
[00:50:38] that was a lot of swordsmiths you killed

[00:50:43] gokaden are still suffering the
[00:50:46] consequences now
[00:50:48] um look at you
[00:50:49] oh don't get so sentimental
[00:50:53] now give that poor little tongue of

[00:51:41] way like I know we're in like a
[00:51:43] simulation but like why the [ __ ] are
[00:51:45] there like enemies
[00:51:48] I guess they're guarding the [ __ ]
[00:51:50] because it's like the delusion Factory
[00:51:51] or some [ __ ] yeah I guess that's why
[00:51:53] it isn't that right which
[00:52:03] oh chat okay so so so so so so so so

[00:52:50] collaboration oh
[00:52:54] when do we start
[00:52:56] you seem impatient you should know that
[00:52:59] becoming a God is far from a trivial
[00:53:02] official of a theme song that plays
[00:53:04] every time he appears transformation is
[00:53:06] a lengthy process as such I too would
[00:53:09] recommend that we commence wait this guy
[00:53:12] dude event that a successful connection
[00:53:14] is this the guy from your lawn story
[00:53:16] Quest I'm permanently bound to the
[00:53:18] machine and he will be unable to move

[00:53:40] oh it was just a sage oh wait who's the
[00:53:43] guy in a way to wait who's that guy wait
[00:53:45] wait wait wait

[00:53:54] shut up you will be like Ozarks you're
[00:53:56] so so true so true ziox wait I'm
[00:53:59] literally watching a video on Billy
[00:54:01] Billy right now one sec
[00:54:04] one sec
[00:54:08] no no listen listen oh I have an ad
[00:54:11] where is it
[00:54:15] okay let's just agree to disagree
[00:54:18] I can't find it all right let's just
[00:54:21] agree to disagree nothing worse than
[00:54:23] what I've been through before then
[00:54:24] doctor
[00:54:26] you were the most resilient test subject
[00:54:28] I ever came across
[00:54:30] thanks to you I was able to Garner a
[00:54:33] great deal of information
[00:54:35] alas after that you were under orders to
[00:54:38] remain in the abyss we barely saw each
[00:54:41] other and it became difficult to further
[00:54:43] refine the knowledge I had gained
[00:54:46] that was gracefully worded
[00:54:49] ever wonder what they think if they knew
[00:54:51] that nothing matters to you apart from
[00:54:53] your crazy experiments I suggest you
[00:54:57] speak to me in a more respectful tone
[00:54:59] Scaramouche the mere fact of your
[00:55:02] utility does not make you indestructible
[00:55:12] that person gives off a very Sinister
[00:55:14] energy
[00:55:19] he's the doctor he's behind all of this
[00:55:25] let's move on
[00:55:29] okay wait one sec Chad I'm still looking
[00:55:31] for the [ __ ] NPC I swear there's
[00:55:33] someone that resembled maybe I'm troll
[00:55:35] maybe look maybe I'm dumb maybe we
[00:55:37] should just move on and agree to
[00:55:38] disagree but I swear I'm thinking of
[00:55:40] someone that looked like him I swear
[00:55:43] it's not iron tongue it's not it's not
[00:55:46] him
[00:55:52] I'm looking I'm looking
[00:55:55] [Music]
[00:55:57] one sec shot
[00:56:01] okay looking back at it this guy does
[00:56:03] not look like him so I'm just gonna
[00:56:05] pretend I didn't say anything and I can
[00:56:07] agree to disagree never mind I was
[00:56:09] definitely the sage I saw him from the
[00:56:10] sage Quest but okay here's the plan
[00:56:12] here's the reason why so I did the sage
[00:56:14] Quest and I remember seeing Azar but
[00:56:15] then I did the long story quest after
[00:56:17] the Arkham Quest so that in my mind it
[00:56:19] was intertwined
[00:56:22] except that he is you just as you are
[00:56:25] you
[00:56:26] yes
[00:56:29] but you can distinguish differentiate
[00:56:32] yourself form your new identity and be
[00:56:35] good watch in your eyes
[00:56:37] are there any differences between humans
[00:56:40] and puppets
[00:56:42] do you think there are any differences
[00:56:44] between
[00:56:46] [Music]
[00:56:49] if not then what are the differences
[00:56:51] between humans and puppets
[00:56:53] Whoever has tasted the choice and
[00:56:55] Sorrows of life in the human realm is
[00:56:57] human
[00:56:59] Whoever has loved and lost cried with
[00:57:02] grief wow dude this is actually that
[00:57:05] eclipses the Miracle of Life
[00:57:08] Nikita said
[00:57:10] whoever tastes the joys and Sorrows of
[00:57:13] life in the human realm is human this is
[00:57:15] reminds me of the time where where where
[00:57:17] someone okay someone was like damn my
[00:57:20] baby died let me go see Buddha and ask
[00:57:22] him hey can you help save my baby so he
[00:57:25] climbs a mountain talks to Buddha says
[00:57:27] please help me save my baby Buddha says
[00:57:29] listen here if you can go back to your
[00:57:31] village and get me a mustard seed from
[00:57:34] anyone who hasn't suffered loss in their
[00:57:36] family I will revive your baby he goes
[00:57:38] back to the Village says hey
[00:57:40] can I have a mustard seed they said no
[00:57:43] I'm sorry I have suffered loss go to the
[00:57:45] next door what about you have you
[00:57:47] suffered lost he said yes I have
[00:57:49] suffered greatly goes next door next
[00:57:51] door no one in the village could give
[00:57:53] him a mustard seed he goes back to
[00:57:55] Buddha he says Buddha I'm sorry but
[00:57:57] please help me save my baby and then no
[00:58:00] one in the village hadn't suffered loss
[00:58:02] and then Buddha said that is a lesson my
[00:58:05] son it is normal to experience loss and
[00:58:08] suffering but through that that is what
[00:58:11] makes you human it is how you you you
[00:58:13] you you you react and and better
[00:58:16] yourself as a person and work through
[00:58:18] tough times and then yeah
[00:58:21] true so that's what nahita's saying like
[00:58:23] you're human because you tasted sorrow
[00:58:25] and joy
[00:58:30] yeah yeah
[00:58:32] I'd like to reclaim the sins that remind
[00:58:34] a bear
[00:58:36] made up story I swear it's true let me
[00:58:39] Google it run from blame Buddha Mustard
[00:58:41] Seed whatever I am due
[00:58:44] let it come to pass
[00:58:48] when she carried the dead child to the
[00:58:50] Buddha and told him her sad story he
[00:58:51] listened with patience and compassion
[00:58:53] and then said to her there's only one
[00:58:55] way to solve your problem go and find me
[00:58:57] four or five mustard seeds from any
[00:58:59] family which there has never been a
[00:59:01] death wow you're like an encyclopedia of
[00:59:04] knowledge you're like an orange but when
[00:59:06] you peel you instead of being a fruit
[00:59:08] it's knowledge
[00:59:13] but won't that mean you lose your
[00:59:16] current identity
[00:59:18] I've always believed that human lives
[00:59:19] follow a set of rules
[00:59:22] with each person being a collection of
[00:59:24] past experiences
[00:59:26] as a puppet living in a human world
[00:59:28] my life is subject to the same wait dude
[00:59:31] who cares if you're a puppet isn't okay
[00:59:33] listen my lower knowledge is very low
[00:59:35] but I come at it with an open heart okay
[00:59:37] I love the Lord I just I'm not I haven't
[00:59:39] read that much so I'm gonna say
[00:59:41] something that might be dumb but it
[00:59:42] might also be smart so bear with me okay
[00:59:44] I just did the event right the yakuro I
[00:59:47] okay that sounded terrible I don't know
[00:59:49] what it was called yuck whatever I did
[00:59:50] the event right and then they were like
[00:59:52] there's like this girl who's like I'm
[00:59:53] actually an object but human form and
[00:59:55] then I was like wow we live different
[00:59:57] lives and there's like the furry dude
[00:59:58] and the samurai right okay they're
[01:00:01] literally not humans so if like night if
[01:00:03] there's a bunch of not human people that
[01:00:04] are acting as human because they're
[01:00:05] objects what's the big deal if you're a
[01:00:07] puppet who the [ __ ] cares there's a
[01:00:09] bunch of [ __ ] NPCs that are like toys

[01:00:33] and ever since I awoke I've just drifted
[01:00:36] from one place to the next
[01:00:37] but then I met you

[01:00:41] pronounced how do you pronounce it an
[01:00:44] opportunity to become a true self

[01:00:51] of honest words a person categories
[01:00:53] themselves and even though the original
[01:00:54] value is gone with the Michelin Man swag

[01:01:13] their Destiny too he's felt to have an
[01:01:15] innate tendency to yearn for something

[01:01:19] most people bro but for all my soul

[01:07:36] remember
[01:07:44] let's continue this outside
[01:07:47] I actually don't know the answer to that
[01:07:49] question there's probably an answer but
[01:07:50] I don't know it
[01:07:52] what the f okay
[01:07:54] there wasn't no precious chest dude
[01:07:56] surely when there's this thing there's a
[01:07:58] precious chest I expect my precious
[01:08:00] chest
[01:08:10] welcome back Traveler
[01:08:15] you don't like being addressed by that
[01:08:17] name I was literally about to say why
[01:08:18] are you calling him balladeer but I was
[01:08:21] just thinking I should
[01:08:25] yes let's name him everything the doctor
[01:08:27] did there's no way I can carry on using
[01:08:30] the name connected to him
[01:08:31] I'm not planning on returning to the
[01:08:33] fatoui and they wouldn't take me back
[01:08:36] anyway
[01:08:37] recent events will have affected a lot
[01:08:39] of people
[01:08:40] so you're quitting the fatoui for good
[01:08:45] it's like you said lesser Lord cousin
[01:08:46] Ali
[01:08:47] everything may look futile
[01:08:49] but it wasn't completely meaningless
[01:08:52] at least I made a lot of people forget
[01:08:54] about me but that doesn't mean your own
[01:08:56] past has disappeared of course as your
[01:09:00] main goal for which you gave up
[01:09:01] everything you had you weren't minus two
[01:09:05] hours
[01:09:06] you can see and understand that
[01:09:08] changing the world changing the past
[01:09:11] changing the fates of other people
[01:09:13] these are not simple things to
[01:09:15] accomplish what you are looking for is
[01:09:18] complete annihilation
[01:09:20] but this is just a fantasy
[01:09:23] even though wait how the air is removed
[01:09:25] from Bohemian Rhapsody moment
[01:09:29] wait chat okay I know I'm not gonna name
[01:09:31] him this but isn't it just a a pure
[01:09:34] corpora business move if I call him like
[01:09:36] twitch Prime isn't that just free money
[01:09:38] if it's like an ad break like every time
[01:09:41] he's on screen
[01:09:43] little in return
[01:09:46] even if I'm completely worthless nothing
[01:09:49] in the world worth regretting
[01:09:51] Mr Solus can you move that lock out of
[01:09:53] your foreheads
[01:09:56] oh this thing yes
[01:09:59] to make sure that you'd acquire that
[01:10:01] information naturally why would you go
[01:10:04] to such lengths you trying to win me
[01:10:07] over too
[01:10:08] I guess your past experiences have made
[01:10:12] you a useful asset to samiru and to me
[01:10:15] winning you over was indeed a part of my
[01:10:17] plan but before that wait what if I
[01:10:21] enable bomb Jones
[01:10:25] I forgot to tell you guys about this
[01:10:27] meme wait wait wait okay those who know
[01:10:29] Bob Jones know Bob Jones okay wait
[01:10:31] there's this guy okay I don't I'm gonna
[01:10:33] try to find him but there's this guy in
[01:10:35] my Tomah guide
[01:10:36] who replied to everyone who's happy
[01:10:39] about Tomah being like viable again
[01:10:40] because he's decent like he's not the
[01:10:41] best but he's okay now and there's this
[01:10:43] guy called Bob Jones who would reply to
[01:10:46] everyone who was happy and was like just
[01:10:48] [ __ ] on them like look at this
[01:10:50] I've always loved Tomah as a character
[01:10:52] and I was so sad to find out he's a bad
[01:10:54] character it makes me happy to see him
[01:10:55] finally becoming relevant LOL he's still
[01:10:58] bad and you should still be sad
[01:11:00] and then in the [ __ ] replies there's
[01:11:03] like a bunch of people yeah look look
[01:11:04] Vape is still the best reaction in the
[01:11:06] game aside from freeze although that's
[01:11:07] more due to Blizzard rather than the
[01:11:09] reaction nothing will ever change that
[01:11:10] Electro geo2 is still mid wait this guy
[01:11:13] thinks Electro's mid
[01:11:17] hey little bro Electro's better than
[01:11:19] Vape anyways especially that ugly whoa
[01:11:22] he called the chicken ugly
[01:11:25] ugly ugly cow
[01:11:27] and the Nemo DPS just don't work okay
[01:11:29] well
[01:11:30] Michelle's better than your main uh with
[01:11:32] photos on right now so rip Bozo dendro's
[01:11:34] also trashed
[01:11:39] are the only good hydros wait this guy
[01:11:42] think kokomi's bad all the other ones
[01:11:44] are garbage especially ayato
[01:11:48] dude what this guy's takes her wait I
[01:11:51] didn't even read this part
[01:11:55] um okay well child's yeah I mean child
[01:11:58] has one good team which I mean isn't bad
[01:12:00] but you can't call ayato F to your child
[01:12:02] because
[01:12:04] all right those better in every single
[01:12:06] team except International Grant the
[01:12:08] International's broken but like this
[01:12:09] guy's also hyperbooms hyperboom's insane
[01:12:13] like everyone's so [ __ ] good but yeah
[01:12:16] Bob Jones is uh not a bad character I
[01:12:19] expected to see
[01:12:20] back but good to know Tama finally has a
[01:12:22] better Niche what do you mean he's still
[01:12:24] garbage virgin is a horrible reaction
[01:12:26] Tomah is an F2 character you should use
[01:12:28] shangling and vape instead
[01:12:31] as someone who's been playing Tomah in
[01:12:33] my Vanessa Hotel team with sucrose ever
[01:12:35] since his release it makes me so happy
[01:12:37] to see he's actually an amazing pick now
[01:12:39] why are you yawing
[01:12:43] Toma with hutau you should use sincho
[01:12:46] yilan and zhongli instead
[01:12:49] yeah I mean
[01:12:51] anyways
[01:12:54] no wait wait a second by the way this
[01:12:57] guy's like the biggest meta slave I've
[01:12:59] ever seen and he's recommending pulling
[01:13:00] for John Lee like John Lee's not a bad
[01:13:02] character but if you're a meta slave you
[01:13:03] skip junglee that's just how it is like
[01:13:05] if all you care about is meta you're I
[01:13:07] would rather pull for the other
[01:13:09] characters he's sitting on what's up
[01:13:11] code my comment's also there literally
[01:13:12] where did I done all it
[01:13:15] was your comment code I'm scrolling
[01:13:17] through Twitter replies on on stream
[01:13:18] this is risky
[01:13:20] why was I born this is
[01:13:24] what does this have to do with the tweet
[01:13:28] true though
[01:13:30] okay news
[01:13:34] um before I say the two three pass all I
[01:13:36] wanted to do is use you that'd be no
[01:13:37] different from the doctor true
[01:13:40] very clever
[01:13:49] utility meta slave but hates dentro yeah
[01:13:51] I don't get it embracing my sins Is What
[01:13:54] It Takes he's like the guy that's
[01:13:55] annoying about meta like there's nothing
[01:13:57] wrong with playing meta I [ __ ] play
[01:13:59] meta if like I think it's enjoyable to
[01:14:00] have characters that do good damage but
[01:14:02] he's like the guy that like shoves it
[01:14:04] down other people's throats but he also
[01:14:06] doesn't
[01:14:07] know what meta is like it's like you
[01:14:09] watched one 10 10 video about Chang Ling
[01:14:11] and then ever since he's like yeah
[01:14:13] vape's the best it's like no
[01:14:17] dude what are you talking about
[01:14:24] is aggravate better than Vape I mean I
[01:14:27] I don't see the point of being like this
[01:14:29] reaction is better than this reaction
[01:14:30] all the reactions like
[01:14:31] I don't know like aggravate's really
[01:14:33] good vape's also good but they're like
[01:14:36] different I also think
[01:14:41] yeah I don't know
[01:14:43] but uh Bloom is really good yeah I think
[01:14:46] hyperbloom is hyperbloom is up there in
[01:14:49] terms of like best reactions in the game
[01:14:50] because the thing with hyperbloom is
[01:14:51] like yeah it's single Target
[01:14:54] of nothing like you can literally use a
[01:14:56] [ __ ] cookie a Barbara and like like
[01:14:58] you can use dot or maybe not Barber but
[01:15:00] yeah I mean you can you can use like dog
[01:15:01] [ __ ] units and make it really good and
[01:15:03] have insane single Target damage and
[01:15:05] like the thing is it's so good that most
[01:15:07] characters best teams
[01:15:09] are worse than just like putting them as
[01:15:12] the last slot in a three character
[01:15:14] hyperboom team like eula's best team is
[01:15:16] EULA and then
[01:15:19] or some [ __ ] like that it's like they
[01:15:21] hyperbloom and then you don't swap to
[01:15:22] EULA
[01:15:24] anyways all right back to the question I
[01:15:26] almost forgot
[01:15:28] you're the good guys
[01:15:29] you're into Justice and all that
[01:15:32] sorry if I have a slightly different
[01:15:34] perspective on things but
[01:15:36] I don't feel like I've been duped
[01:15:39] the wisest leaders are fated to end up
[01:15:41] with the best helpers
[01:15:43] I can live with that
[01:15:45] I'm glad you're able to think of
[01:15:54] think of him being covered also even
[01:15:57] before okay never mind let's focus on
[01:15:59] the quest
[01:16:01] actually no let's not focus on the quest
[01:16:03] I have to get this out even before
[01:16:04] dendro came out Elektra was still good
[01:16:06] [ __ ] everyone okay listen listen there's
[01:16:08] a lot of misinformation but I've been
[01:16:10] saying it electric dude electrocharge is
[01:16:12] really [ __ ] good taser's really good
[01:16:13] officials broken betels honestly pretty
[01:16:15] [ __ ] insane and the other electric
[01:16:16] characters are good too okay also right
[01:16:19] in like right in even without dendro's
[01:16:20] [ __ ] broken it's like
[01:16:22] Electro's always been good and dendro
[01:16:24] made it even better so it's like it's
[01:16:26] not like Vape was the only good reaction
[01:16:27] I'd argue electric I'd rather have
[01:16:29] Electro like I think if you have to
[01:16:31] choose between Alex reactions or power
[01:16:32] reactions I'd go Electro
[01:16:34] uh all obviously superconduct his ass
[01:16:37] and overload is if the enemies get
[01:16:39] displaced it sucks balls
[01:16:42] mod someone ban Fang really fast thank
[01:16:45] you
[01:16:46] um
[01:16:48] but yeah
[01:16:49] I mean vape's good but like you're
[01:16:51] vaping on what like two characters three
[01:16:54] or like two characters and a yenfei like
[01:16:56] okay congrats like ooh this is but
[01:16:59] anyways I mean like I guess like a bit
[01:17:01] more but yeah my point like it's it's
[01:17:02] nice but it's not
[01:17:04] yeah
[01:17:05] yeah I will try
[01:17:07] Traveler
[01:17:10] free Fang no she just said focus on the
[01:17:12] quest I'm sorry I'm sorry after I dove
[01:17:15] into the information torrents and Urban
[01:17:16] Soul
[01:17:17] why did you go to Inazuma
[01:17:21] bad take electric charges poo no
[01:17:22] electric is actually pretty good the
[01:17:24] thing is you can't [ __ ] calc the
[01:17:25] damage because it's split amongst like
[01:17:27] 26 million characters but the best part
[01:17:29] of electrocharge isn't even the
[01:17:30] reactions damage it's the fact that
[01:17:31] hydro and Electro can coexist if not you
[01:17:34] or and or you apply both so much that
[01:17:37] you end up swirling both buffing the
[01:17:38] damage of your hydro and electric
[01:17:39] characters and then both the hydro and
[01:17:41] the lecture characters are broken
[01:17:42] because almost every Hydro character in
[01:17:44] the game is insane almost every electric
[01:17:45] character in the game Dory doesn't count
[01:17:47] is really good so you end up just having
[01:17:49] a really good team comp even if the
[01:17:50] reactions damage isn't as high as Vape
[01:17:52] the electrocharge teams will oftentimes
[01:17:54] be very high like usually better or
[01:17:57] maybe not better because changing but
[01:17:58] yeah
[01:17:59] so that's how you found out whose fate
[01:18:01] had changed and how well whatever your
[01:18:05] reasons you did me a favor and I'll do
[01:18:09] everything I can to pay it back
[01:18:13] the reactions are just the character
[01:18:14] it's still the element
[01:18:17] you balance characters around their
[01:18:19] element like
[01:18:21] freeze is broken okay everyone agrees
[01:18:24] freeze is broken against except against
[01:18:25] bosses like if the meta is always bosses
[01:18:27] then whatever but when you can freeze
[01:18:29] everyone agrees it's broken okay why
[01:18:32] because you don't take damage the
[01:18:33] enemies don't move it's easy to DPS them
[01:18:36] not and because you get 40 crit rate
[01:18:39] from Blizzard's Trader now you might be
[01:18:40] like oh but that's just the artifact set
[01:18:42] well yeah but that's part of the [ __ ]
[01:18:43] game it's part of what makes the
[01:18:45] reaction good what makes Vape good okay
[01:18:47] it's a multiplier sure but melt is a
[01:18:50] higher multiplier it's not just the fact
[01:18:52] that you're vaping it's like everything
[01:18:54] about it it's the fact that you can
[01:18:56] trial Chang Ling
[01:18:59] so yeah I mean like yeah I don't know
[01:19:04] electric charges is very yeah
[01:19:07] but also another thing is like I think
[01:19:08] you balance characters based on their
[01:19:10] reaction sometimes I mean devs might not
[01:19:12] do a good job that's up to you know your
[01:19:17] a decision but like you you know your
[01:19:19] opinion but like
[01:19:21] the reason why characters have like
[01:19:24] you're gonna balance a character based
[01:19:25] around the reactions that they do so
[01:19:27] like you're not gonna give an electric
[01:19:28] like you're not gonna give it a Nemo DPS
[01:19:32] lower scalings than like a pyro one
[01:19:34] ideally maybe you do but ideally it's
[01:19:37] like higher [ __ ] scalings where
[01:19:39] they're not procking Vape or they're not
[01:19:41] procking melt
[01:19:43] anyways
[01:19:44] whatever reasons yeah yeah sure
[01:19:46] borrowing and returning are the only
[01:19:48] real relationships between individuals
[01:19:50] all balance the books one day don't you
[01:19:53] worry
[01:19:54] that's not true
[01:19:56] a relationship between two people is not
[01:19:58] simply a ledger that can be reset to
[01:20:00] zero
[01:20:01] I think deep down you realize this
[01:20:05] people who show up in your life don't
[01:20:07] just evaporate like water drops and
[01:20:09] leave nothing behind
[01:20:10] there's no such thing as balancing the
[01:20:13] books some things in this world can
[01:20:15] never be brought back
[01:20:17] and they can never be changed which is
[01:20:20] why there is emotions just like the
[01:20:22] child from the Buddha story
[01:20:24] he can't re-bought bro brought back
[01:20:26] because that is how human world works
[01:20:31] I don't know enough about
[01:20:34] it and whatever is missing and you will
[01:20:37] not be made whole
[01:20:39] human is
[01:20:42] you can choose whether or not you want
[01:20:44] to be human
[01:20:47] the humans can't live without a heart
[01:20:49] can they
[01:20:51] anyway
[01:20:52] I gave up trying to become a human a
[01:20:54] long time ago
[01:20:55] you understand what pain is perfectly
[01:20:57] well even without a heart
[01:21:00] you're just bearing your feelings
[01:21:02] the past is set in stone but you can
[01:21:05] keep moving on
[01:21:06] and the longer if he does a demon why
[01:21:08] what did she do the shorter your past
[01:21:10] will become until one day it is but a
[01:21:13] tiny fraction of your life
[01:21:15] it sounds like you've got a future
[01:21:16] planned out for me
[01:21:19] I hope you can give nahida a chance
[01:21:24] doesn't even know where to start but the
[01:21:27] most important thing now all the archons
[01:21:29] are named after demons okay but like
[01:21:35] thank you
[01:21:46] foreign
[01:21:51] then I guess I'll be helping you from
[01:21:54] behind the scenes from now on
[01:21:56] wait what
[01:21:59] I'm glad that you've accepted our
[01:22:01] proposal

[01:28:12] it's fine
[01:28:16] accordingly
[01:28:18] but it won't be immediate dude it's so
[01:28:21] good
[01:28:23] because you can't use special characters
[01:28:24] but this isn't a special character it's
[01:28:26] like a it's a letter from another
[01:28:28] alphabet I think descendance of the ride
[01:28:30] in gokaden living in Nina Zuma some of
[01:28:33] them know I think I'm not they oughta
[01:28:36] know about the connection between white
[01:28:37] and gokaden and myself

[01:28:41] time being say it out loud
[01:28:44] please tell them that I was the one
[01:28:46] responsible for the writing gokaden's
[01:28:48] downfall
[01:28:49] even though the events have been erased
[01:28:51] from the world they still deserve to
[01:28:53] know the truth
[01:28:54] a character from sinhalese language
[01:28:57] which means makes a na sound very rarely
[01:28:59] used also looks like a crewmate from
[01:29:01] okay why do you include the last part
[01:29:03] see
[01:29:05] that is up to you
[01:29:07] huh
[01:29:09] if we do that
[01:29:12] it's fine
[01:29:13] let them stab their blades into my chest
[01:29:15] if they so desire
[01:29:17] such a good name we should have been
[01:29:21] let them stop their blades that's kind
[01:29:23] of sauce this kind of sauce
[01:29:29] No Nonsense I like it all right my humor
[01:29:33] is so [ __ ] I'm like dude I'm like
[01:29:36] mentally 12. and you too

[01:29:43] have been like living an entire lifetime
[01:29:45] in an instant
[01:29:47] I'll need some time to calm down
[01:29:51] true
[01:29:52] so after everything that's so we can
[01:29:54] finally go eat thank you both [ __ ] can
[01:29:57] we see him again what is his name
[01:30:05] where is it
[01:30:08] no where's Scaro End by novel with some
[01:30:12] words from mikoshi nagamasa
[01:30:14] you mean because everyone else in the
[01:30:17] story is doing the teapot yeah we will
[01:30:20] die to The Ripe old age he
[01:30:25] the dark clouds had dissipated okay they
[01:30:28] continued to cast their shadow in
[01:30:30] makoshi nagamasa's mind do you party
[01:30:32] yeah we'll go to the teapot I think
[01:30:33] that's the best take as an old man

[01:30:38] Blade the daisatara nagamasa was forged
[01:30:41] the people rejoiced and there was
[01:30:43] painting dancing and drinking all these
[01:30:46] expressions of Joy melted down in the
[01:30:49] furnace fire until life is a story too
[01:30:52] long to be told true

[01:31:37] and this is generally making me consider
[01:31:39] pulling scar on yeah you should

[01:31:56] look at your profile wait
[01:32:01] wait I actually don't know well I should
[01:32:02] probably put scarra here right uh

[01:32:28] ahead
[01:32:30] [Music]
[01:32:39] wait should I add a pogus now a pogus
[01:32:45] foreign
[01:32:58] pay attention to the lore yeah I'll read
[01:33:00] it one sec
[01:33:01] that's why I paused but I didn't pause
[01:33:03] look at the vase
[01:33:06] [Music]
[01:33:09] remember there being a cleaner and then
[01:33:12] there's a beep and we wake up again
[01:33:13] aware
[01:33:14] but now we sit here probably bumps into
[01:33:16] it after being startled by something to
[01:33:18] do with the ballet deer and broke the
[01:33:19] vase true
[01:33:22] but the batteries has existing change
[01:33:24] the world so why is his face still

[01:33:50] unfortunately the fate of tavat cannot
[01:33:54] easily be changed
[01:33:57] perhaps a god may have a slim chance
[01:34:00] but for anyone else
[01:34:04] who can say when a small animal runs
[01:34:08] into a tree trunk yeah though the tree
[01:34:11] May sway it is not displaced if a tree
[01:34:14] falls in a forest and no one sees it
[01:34:16] then the tree really fall yeah a good
[01:34:18] point whoever you are like a vase that
[01:34:21] falls to the ground
[01:34:23] whether it is broken by a cat or by a
[01:34:26] bird the result is still a broken vase
[01:34:30] is it not
[01:34:35] ice
[01:34:38] history does not change easily but it's
[01:34:42] like female Danes leaf
[01:34:45] believe your own eyes
[01:34:48] only that which you see is true
[01:34:52] what is unseen is but an illusion
[01:34:57] I don't know who the [ __ ] this is
[01:35:00] Chad is typing names but
[01:35:08] god of time probably
[01:35:12] enough
[01:35:20] anyway
[01:35:23] still lying there broken on the ground
[01:35:25] ship I'm gonna go get someone to clean
[01:35:27] it up
[01:35:28] feels wrong just leaving it there
[01:35:31] just a moment but I'm gonna be right
[01:35:33] back
[01:35:35] so I'm getting sick
[01:35:40] my nose is like running
[01:35:42] I wonder what else awaits me
[01:35:46] oh that's it we did it
[01:35:48] [Music]
[01:35:49] did I took two hours
