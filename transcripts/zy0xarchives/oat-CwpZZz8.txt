[00:14:36] heater you're weird so not in the heat
[00:14:38] up
[00:14:39] gomc hey I'm a Geo MC player no I'm not
[00:14:44] anyways welcome to the Stream uh we're
[00:14:48] gonna start with a quick classy sassy
[00:14:50] brassy Wordle integan General
[00:14:54] just play OMG listen here bud listen
[00:14:57] here bud if all I did was play against
[00:14:59] you and then go to bed this stream would
[00:15:01] last 26 minutes okay we have to milk the
[00:15:04] content over here at ziox headquarters
[00:15:06] so we're gonna start with the Wordle I'm
[00:15:08] gonna close chat so I can't cheat and
[00:15:10] now let's go all right we're gonna cream
[00:15:11] and we're gonna pound I mean I could do
[00:15:14] a guess like with this I can do like
[00:15:15] like multi
[00:15:19] [ __ ] that would have been so good okay
[00:15:20] maybe an iPad no wait we actually got
[00:15:22] this
[00:15:25] Mage
[00:15:28] Maps
[00:15:42] dude what is this Donald saying
[00:15:47] magic oh there's no C [ __ ]
[00:15:50] mad imagine
[00:15:57] okay I'm just gonna speed around let's
[00:15:59] just do pound just to get letters out of
[00:16:00] the way okay we got no letters
[00:16:05] okay Mass Mao ma Maverick MAV mab
[00:16:19] Mass I think it's like M A and then a
[00:16:21] double letter like mass or like
[00:16:29] it could be but this is a bad guess if
[00:16:31] it's not masks because like it's a waste
[00:16:33] of like two letters you get me so I
[00:16:34] think we just do one s we do like math
[00:16:37] Mavis
[00:16:39] this is a word what the [ __ ] is
[00:16:41] okay well it's not that
[00:16:43] um
[00:16:44] am I gonna lose I think I'm gonna lose
[00:16:46] okay let me be smart about this m a f
[00:16:51] h
[00:16:58] maybe it's like m-a-m like it could be
[00:17:00] like something weird like this like Mama
[00:17:05] dude are you are you kidding Ma
[00:17:16] maze wait
[00:17:21] this isn't a word is it
[00:17:24] dude are you if
[00:17:27] you mean you're joking like if you're
[00:17:29] joking that's okay but if you're not
[00:17:31] then what is this I think it's m a
[00:17:33] something something a because there's no
[00:17:34] other vowel so it could be like like
[00:17:36] like
[00:17:38] um
[00:17:43] I feel like there's a word
[00:17:52] dude what the [ __ ] is this
[00:17:59] do you guys know this word am I dumb
[00:18:02] like surely this isn't a word right
[00:18:06] [ __ ] it I'm just gonna do everything
[00:18:07] until something works
[00:18:12] okay this isn't a word by the way
[00:18:14] whatever this word is isn't real
[00:18:15] whatever this word is is not a real word
[00:18:17] just so you guys know
[00:18:19] if you use this word in a sentence
[00:18:21] you're weird just so you know like no
[00:18:23] disrespect
[00:18:25] oh it could be like something no a can't
[00:18:27] even be there
[00:18:35] dude
[00:18:40] what is this I
[00:18:47] this is just not a word
[00:18:50] it's literally not a word
[00:18:56] F no okay that's sorry M A m-a let me
[00:18:59] Sip Coffee maybe the caffeine
[00:19:02] May the caffeine will help m-a-w-h
[00:19:10] like it can't be like there's no other
[00:19:12] vowel so it has to be like let's say
[00:19:13] it's a g there has to be like an H after
[00:19:15] or like an a no that can't be an a like
[00:19:17] it has to be like double g
[00:19:21] dude
[00:19:28] oh the Pokemon Magby
[00:19:31] oh magma oh my [ __ ] god

[00:32:45] Trailblazer power that's pretty cool
[00:32:51] sure we'll get that again soon don't
[00:32:52] worry well I got that the thing with
[00:32:54] gunshin is like we so instead of giving
[00:32:56] us more they're not just gonna give us
[00:32:58] more resin right they're gonna give us
[00:33:00] faster resin recharge a bigger supply of
[00:33:03] it more condensable resin and and you
[00:33:08] can do faster domains uh uh if you've
[00:33:11] cleared it 100 times and so you'll be
[00:33:14] like dude but zionics like I want resin
[00:33:16] as much as the next guy but if we have
[00:33:18] so much resin what are we gonna do with
[00:33:19] it like eventually everyone will have
[00:33:21] every artifact then what are we gonna
[00:33:22] just quit no no no no no
[00:33:24] we're actually gonna get new end game
[00:33:27] co-op with your friends where we can all
[00:33:30] fight a scalable difficulty raid called
[00:33:34] the dragon of resin okay in French

[00:35:01] nobody asked if my birthday was
[00:35:02] yesterday oh you're right no wanna sorry
[00:35:05] I was actually gonna stream yesterday
[00:35:06] but then okay okay okay okay I can make
[00:35:10] up like a legitimate reason why I didn't
[00:35:11] stream because like I was busy I was
[00:35:13] working on the Lynette video
[00:35:15] um Alan who's helping me edit had to
[00:35:17] like evacuate because there's like a
[00:35:19] hurricane so like I was like yo take
[00:35:20] your time no no I did some stuff on my
[00:35:22] end everything's cool but
[00:35:25] the real reason is at like 1am I was
[00:35:28] like I was like okay you know what I'll
[00:35:29] play one swift plate of Valor with Julie
[00:35:32] and like the homies right dude we lost
[00:35:34] like we lost and I was like okay well
[00:35:36] let's just like we can't end on a loss
[00:35:37] we literally I played like seven games
[00:35:39] till we won dude I literally aced and we
[00:35:42] still lost like three of the games it's
[00:35:44] okay it's all good it happens but I was
[00:35:46] like and then it was like [ __ ] 3am
[00:35:48] and I was like you know what I'll just
[00:35:49] stream tomorrow and I did and now I'm
[00:35:51] here so it's
[00:35:55] so it's fine
[00:36:04] what's Lynette's best set she is a Nemo
[00:36:06] what do you think they're literally
[00:36:08] every Animo character that's not Xiao or
[00:36:11] scarra arguably
[00:36:13] who wants to use the same [ __ ] set
[00:36:14] they literally all like every [ __ ]
[00:36:16] animal character
[00:36:19] any animal support at least
[00:36:21] um
[00:36:22] um

[00:39:04] as well I don't know what the [ __ ] this
[00:39:06] is but this weapon wasn't here before so
[00:39:08] this must be Fountain must be my lucky
[00:39:11] day
[00:39:17] you know what I don't want to jump down
[00:39:19] because then I don't know how I'm going
[00:39:20] to jump back up so I'm gonna pretend
[00:39:21] this chest doesn't exist and I'm just
[00:39:22] gonna fly over here I still can't okay
[00:39:27] dude okay listen mainstream what

[00:39:34] hours so shortly this week but I don't
[00:39:37] know
[00:39:42] there's a Sealy over here
[00:39:47] are you excited for any new Fontan
[00:39:49] characters okay
[00:39:51] I want to make this very clear
[00:39:53] every single word every statement every
[00:39:57] sentence I have made about Al Haytham I
[00:40:00] mean it about nive yet I am not
[00:40:03] exaggerating
[00:40:04] I am saying this before he is out I have
[00:40:06] been saying this since all we knew about
[00:40:08] him was his blue coat
[00:40:15] that's all
[00:40:29] socionics what do you think of DPS
[00:40:31] Bennett DPS Bennett
[00:40:34] um still better than to Luke
[00:40:36] sorry no I'm kidding uh it's actually
[00:40:37] pretty it gets good the only problem I
[00:40:39] have with it is like what like
[00:40:42] it feels like you're
[00:40:44] like Bennett's so good okay the the only
[00:40:47] problem with Bennett as a DPS is that
[00:40:49] you can't run Bennett as a support but
[00:40:51] you kind of can because he Buffs himself
[00:40:53] so it doesn't matter like it's still I
[00:40:55] mean it's you know you can like you can
[00:40:57] like melt Bennett with like Chong Yun
[00:40:58] and [ __ ] or like sing Cho Bennett like
[00:41:00] you know you can do stuff
[00:41:03] or 40f

[00:41:23] it is
[00:41:29] Bennett is s tier okay I can one-up you

[00:41:34] game
[00:41:35] actually not even probably another
[00:41:36] outside of sumeru and it's not just like
[00:41:38] dendro meta every two [ __ ] seconds
[00:41:39] every single Abyss Bennett is literally
[00:41:41] the best character in the game
[00:41:44] foreign
[00:41:52] Hydro 5 stars came out even Elon came
[00:41:54] out singtra went from being needed in
[00:41:56] every team to being broken but

[00:49:44] about that later we have a lot to do
[00:49:47] um let's go here first
[00:49:53] let's go here first
[00:50:01] wait chat
[00:50:03] help me help me understand something
[00:50:08] these guys right do they have
[00:50:11] are there Shields or not there but like
[00:50:13] the cryo dude does he have like a
[00:50:15] [ __ ]
[00:50:16] Lucia mechanic I haven't fought him yet
[00:50:20] but I've heard from the people on the
[00:50:25] in the in the chat rooms
[00:50:28] yes so can I just like limit him
[00:50:30] let me do it
[00:50:32] because I've only fought the Animo I
[00:50:33] thought the girl I didn't fight the guy
[00:50:37] so it should be this one and then do I
[00:50:40] do it when he Shields let's see let's
[00:50:41] see I've been like I'm pretty sure I
[00:50:43] know how it works I haven't tried it so
[00:50:44] I don't actually know
[00:50:51] oh
[00:50:55] when does he Shield
[00:51:06] s this guy gonna Shield this or no
[00:51:09] yes or no
[00:51:11] yes or no
[00:51:18] okay maybe I have to like damage him
[00:51:28] how did that go there yo chill
[00:51:36] don't die
[00:51:38] good thing out there as much oh there it
[00:51:39] is wait so I should be able to
[00:51:46] okay cool it works
[00:51:54] [ __ ] is this attack pattern oh wait let
[00:51:56] me do it again I guess the full shield
[00:51:57] to see
[00:51:59] oh yeah it literally just removes it
[00:52:03] okay so there are
[00:52:07] it's like that in the abyss and and you
[00:52:09] can like whenever he comes to the abyss
[00:52:11] I'm sure they will and then you can just
[00:52:13] bring Lynette or given how The Shield is
[00:52:15] in the Overworld you could also just
[00:52:17] bring pyro characters bye
[00:52:19] I suspect
[00:52:22] that there might be a chance that the
[00:52:24] shield is gonna be super [ __ ] hard to
[00:52:25] break without Lucia so maybe maybe
[00:52:27] they'll be like well [ __ ] you if you
[00:52:29] play Pyro hopefully not hopefully you
[00:52:31] could just bring pyro instead in case
[00:52:33] you don't want to bring usia but uh
[00:52:35] we'll see ya I get it
[00:52:42] that wasn't funny that wasn't funny

[00:53:56] like reach the highest Branch without
[00:53:58] even having to jump so like
[00:54:01] I feel like it would be a waste of my
[00:54:04] natural gift if I wasn't nice like if
[00:54:08] you're born a giant why would you not
[00:54:11] help people out that need that height
[00:54:14] that could use it
[00:54:16] it's like I would be selfish if I didn't

[00:54:20] it's just like my duty honestly
[00:54:30] wait why is my expedition in the midsole

[00:54:40] surely right
[00:54:48] sucks seems so serious you actually look
[00:54:51] like him trust this is my final message
[00:54:53] I am not looking up you know what I
[00:54:55] don't even
[00:55:06] dude I don't look like this guy
[00:55:10] listen I know my haircut's a little too
[00:55:13] short I don't look like this guy no I
[00:55:17] don't explain every day I don't look
[00:55:19] like this guy
[00:55:21] I you know what okay yeah I should have
[00:55:23] done what I'll do I I I felt bad at
[00:55:26] first but now I regret not doing all of
[00:55:28] you
[00:55:33] dude why do they keep adding
[00:55:35] advertisement boards who is reading
[00:55:36] those
[00:55:45] um that's what I want right
[00:55:51] this looks cool I kind of want to get it
[00:55:58] is the net good
[00:56:00] man that's the answer she's like okay
[00:56:02] okay okay okay okay okay
[00:56:03] Lynette okay as a friendly emotions
[00:56:06] pretty good like I'll use her my second
[00:56:07] account but she's not good enough to
[00:56:09] wear like okay she's good in like Fontan
[00:56:12] content like a lot of Fontana characters
[00:56:13] no that's not true a lot of fun enemies
[00:56:15] have mechanics that you can like disable
[00:56:17] or like Shields or whatever with usia or
[00:56:20] pneumonia and then she's an uclan
[00:56:22] character so it's hard to tell how good
[00:56:24] she'll be but it's I assume she's made
[00:56:27] for Funtime content well she is made for
[00:56:28] Fountain contact so if there's new
[00:56:30] Fontana business she might be better
[00:56:31] than some of the other animos that are
[00:56:33] usually better than her like sucrose is
[00:56:34] better than her cause is better than her
[00:56:36] but there may be situations where you
[00:56:37] want to use her but I was like a free to
[00:56:39] play anymore option she's pretty decent
[00:56:40] and I'll probably use it on my free to
[00:56:41] play account
[00:56:45] okay I need these I want to make this I
[00:56:47] think it looks cool
[00:56:49] um is there another Free Play Weapon I
[00:56:51] should make also oh my God they use the
[00:56:53] same oh thank God they use the same
[00:56:55] [ __ ] prototype mats as um well the
[00:56:58] sooner ones are harder to get but at
[00:57:00] least they use like not a new one okay
[00:57:01] cool
[00:57:03] cool
[00:57:06] yeah
[00:57:16] not really so the thing is sucrose
[00:57:20] okay the thing with sucrose is she can
[00:57:23] give thrilling Tales to Lenny and even
[00:57:25] if the uptime's not 100 it's still
[00:57:27] valuable
[00:57:28] and she can group better
[00:57:31] and
[00:57:33] um
[00:57:34] she also okay
[00:57:37] I know I [ __ ] hate sucrose's C6 this
[00:57:39] thing infuses with water when you use it
[00:57:42] and there's like the enemy is like a
[00:57:44] little wet it it's dumb but with
[00:57:48] a mono Pyro Team you usually are only
[00:57:51] using pyro so you're probably gonna
[00:57:53] Infuse Pyro
[00:57:56] um so like there's reasons to use
[00:57:57] sucrose
[00:57:59] thank you for reading yeah also as the
[00:58:02] someone in chat pointed out for some
[00:58:03] reason
[00:58:05] Lenny is like yo guys guys get this the
[00:58:09] more characters of the same type the
[00:58:11] better I do and then Lynette is like nah
[00:58:13] [ __ ] you actually uh the more characters
[00:58:15] of different types the better we do so
[00:58:18] it's kind of weird where it's like in a
[00:58:20] linear team you're gonna give him like
[00:58:21] eight percent attack Maybe 12.
[00:58:23] for 10 seconds which is like the same up
[00:58:25] time as thrilling Tales which is 48
[00:58:27] percent
[00:58:29] so it's like yeah sibling Behavior true
[00:58:32] so yeah like I I didn't want to I
[00:58:34] mentioned Lynette in my Liney video
[00:58:36] because like there is some Synergy like
[00:58:38] this is the taunt can actually be nice
[00:58:40] she can still go for this inventor she's
[00:58:42] new so if you like like usia a line
[00:58:44] thing for Fontan like you can use them
[00:58:46] if you want it's just not gonna be
[00:58:47] better
[00:58:49] then I like
[00:58:51] yeah
[00:58:58] yeah I'm curious to see from an ace kit
[00:59:01] I'm just hyped that he has [ __ ]
[00:59:02] mechanical penguins oh
[00:59:07] like I'm not gonna lie I'm sure he's
[00:59:08] gonna be okay no disrespect he looks so
[00:59:11] four-star that he's probably gonna be
[00:59:12] bad but I'm hyped because he has cute
[00:59:16] penguins and just because of that I want
[00:59:17] to play him so I hope he's good

[01:05:06] she's gonna hold you to Jungkook
[01:05:08] standard you can't win just accept
[01:05:09] defeat like admit that you'll never be
[01:05:12] yeah no it's over I'm sorry like it
[01:05:14] might still work out I'm just saying you
[01:05:16] can't compete so just like yeah that's
[01:05:19] fine
[01:05:27] can learn that replace sucrose in beta
[01:05:29] official if you ever see six uh sucrose
[01:05:31] is still better because the EM sharing
[01:05:33] hokushin ring or whatever but like
[01:05:35] unironically okay I'm not gonna tell you
[01:05:38] to get a C6 Linette because that might
[01:05:39] cost a lot of money don't but I'm saying
[01:05:41] if you do have it you can Animo Infuse
[01:05:43] and then you can be an on-field driver
[01:05:44] in that team and you can like double
[01:05:45] swirl and you could be fine
[01:05:48] um I wouldn't like sucrose is better
[01:05:50] though for that
[01:05:54] so uh if you're asking for c0
[01:05:57] maybe but then you need another on
[01:05:59] Fielder and then at that point it's a
[01:06:01] bit quite a bit worse
[01:06:04] um but you could play like I mean Beto
[01:06:06] can tactically on field
[01:06:07] or if you have like yeah you could use
[01:06:08] like yeah on field
[01:06:17] are we doing it
[01:06:19] so Jeff tested Lynette C6 and it was so
[01:06:21] bad yeah it's not okay disclaimer let me
[01:06:24] rephrase this it's not good like Lynette
[01:06:26] as a support is usually better
[01:06:28] but it's fine in taser teams that's the
[01:06:30] one team we're like dude it's fine
[01:06:32] you're double swirling yourself damage
[01:06:33] is like okay it's not better than
[01:06:34] sucrose it's not better than like scarra
[01:06:37] hazel whatever like it's not good but
[01:06:39] it's fine yeah you can play it if you
[01:06:40] want to that's fine
[01:06:43] and you get to be a cat girl
[01:06:45] so that's a win I think
[01:06:51] is it just VV yeah you play VV
[01:06:54] she also gives you some attack uh and
[01:06:56] some Elemental application with her
[01:06:57] burst and a little bit of grouping it's
[01:07:00] not a lot with C1
[01:07:02] um
[01:07:04] yeah okay sorry that was weird I
[01:07:07] actually want to unboxing one I think
[01:07:08] the network one is like
[01:07:09] I mean
[01:07:13] let's go see one [ __ ] it I can see two
[01:07:19] first one isn't that good it's not
[01:07:21] the grouping isn't huge but it's better
[01:07:24] than nothing and it actually feels the
[01:07:26] streamer who spent two years looking for
[01:07:28] Lenny Talent books also happy people
[01:07:31] okay how do I say this okay okay okay
[01:07:33] okay okay it's not great
[01:07:35] but it's okay like if especially if it's
[01:07:38] kind of like look I'll show you
[01:07:40] well it might not work in this domain
[01:07:42] actually this domain is pretty big these
[01:07:44] enemies are pretty big but like I played
[01:07:46] it in like
[01:07:47] um Abyss 12 like all the rift towns I
[01:07:49] played two on the net for a bit and like
[01:07:52] they still like will teleport away after
[01:07:54] a bit but it does pull them a bit closer
[01:07:55] together which at least makes me feel
[01:07:57] happy even if not the biggest deal
[01:08:01] because it just pulls them a little
[01:08:02] right
[01:08:04] okay it doesn't do [ __ ] against these
[01:08:06] guys well never mind yeah it doesn't do
[01:08:08] [ __ ] again oh no you have to hold it you
[01:08:10] have to hold D I lied you have to
[01:08:12] you have to hold the I forgot I forgot I
[01:08:14] forgot I forgot that was that was
[01:08:16] without it that was about it I forgot I
[01:08:18] forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot I
[01:08:20] forgot but I remembered I remembered so
[01:08:21] fast wow zox good thing good job
[01:08:24] remembering so fast thanks they don't
[01:08:26] call me the remember for nothing
[01:08:29] recorded
[01:08:33] yeah I mean there doesn't do [ __ ] but
[01:08:35] they'd have to be like like hear it
[01:08:36] probably will if they
[01:08:39] yeah I mean it's like yeah it doesn't do
[01:08:41] much against these guys
[01:08:42] imma keep it real
[01:08:45] hello coach
[01:08:50] wait what the [ __ ] just happened to my
[01:08:51] why did it what was that yo what was
[01:08:53] that camera angle why did it show the
[01:08:55] ground
[01:08:56] it's show time
[01:09:04] is that flake they call me the tens of
[01:09:06] uh in fact
[01:09:13] yeah I mean it doesn't really do [ __ ]
[01:09:16] against these enemies but
[01:09:21] let me try it again
[01:09:30] hey yeah
[01:09:34] me
[01:09:39] let me do it in um Abyss Sidra
[01:09:45] yeah also displacement is a lot worse
[01:09:46] until you're within 20 levels of the
[01:09:48] enemy
[01:09:50] or not within the like yeah like you
[01:09:53] wanna you'd want to be 80 for level 100
[01:09:55] enemies but they were 90 and we were 70
[01:09:57] so it should still be fine
[01:10:00] um
[01:10:01] let's try against small enemies let's
[01:10:03] try here
[01:10:15] I just okay surely here it works yeah
[01:10:18] like that's actually kind of noticeable
[01:10:20] it's not like insane it's not like Cosmo
[01:10:22] it's not too gross but like it's kind of
[01:10:24] like a like a little bit of Hazel action
[01:10:25] it's like it's okay
[01:10:28] it helps it's not like great but helps
[01:10:35] and then if you have sacking into it
[01:10:36] twice
[01:10:41] it's nice
[01:10:50] okay Chad I have so much I want to do
[01:10:52] but I also want to just like grind the
[01:10:53] new domain should I start oh okay let's
[01:10:56] do it let's do a Abyss clear first
[01:10:58] because I didn't do an hibis clear with
[01:10:59] Lenny Lynette in a while we'll do that
[01:11:01] and then
[01:11:03] we'll do the domain
[01:11:09] is flat sound which is the worst
[01:11:10] festering desire flesh all that gives
[01:11:12] you
[01:11:13] um yeah filtering desires but but okay
[01:11:16] Professor desire is 1.2 also flip song
[01:11:19] gives you
[01:11:20] um it's ER crit rate and then
[01:11:23] um more ER right is it just like a [ __ ]
[01:11:26] ton of VR
[01:11:27] yeah
[01:11:29] love songs Kenshin weapon
[01:11:32] yeah it is
[01:11:35] um
[01:11:38] yeah
[01:11:40] how much damage is festering desire
[01:11:44] 32 skill damage and 12 crit rate
[01:11:51] yeah I mean hey if you have festering
[01:11:53] desire hey
[01:11:56] but I will say I kind of want to get the
[01:11:58] new fishing sword because it looks cool
[01:12:03] also I saw a okay I saw someone using
[01:12:06] the Fishbowl on yilon
[01:12:09] well I was like going through accounts
[01:12:11] and it looked cool and now I want it but
[01:12:13] it's like it's old news now it's not
[01:12:15] even like the new one so I kind of want
[01:12:16] to get it
[01:12:18] I think it looks cool
[01:12:20] yeah I don't know
[01:12:24] yeah end of the line
[01:12:29] sorry whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I'm sorry
[01:12:31] I was just imitating
[01:12:41] yeah pause I'm sorry all right let's go
[01:12:43] let's go we're gonna do an abyss clear
[01:12:44] we're gonna play Lenny Big L as I call
[01:12:47] him uh he's not fully ascended I'll
[01:12:49] probably do this so I was saving my
[01:12:50] resin to do the new domain and then I
[01:12:52] think whenever I don't stream like a day
[01:12:54] or two that I don't stream I'll just
[01:12:55] I'll do the bosses so that I can spend
[01:12:57] my stream resin on artifacts and then my
[01:12:59] Austin resin leveling my dudes I think
[01:13:01] I'll do that
[01:13:02] um
[01:13:05] level Lenny's e
[01:13:12] maybe we can claim the battle pass I can
[01:13:14] claim the battle pass
[01:13:15] true
[01:13:25] well this is awkward
[01:13:28] uh please don't judge me please please
[01:13:30] don't judge me please
[01:13:33] please don't judge me please don't judge
[01:13:35] me
[01:13:38] look you gotta do what you gotta do in
[01:13:41] life you gotta do what you gotta do you
[01:13:44] gotta do what you gotta do
[01:13:50] it's a new region do you expect me to
[01:13:52] have every new book be honest okay it
[01:13:55] still should be higher than six but it's
[01:13:57] fine for now
[01:13:58] I might on ironically no I don't think
[01:14:00] I'll Crown but I'll get his [ __ ] to nine
[01:14:02] for sure I like Lenny I think it's fun
[01:14:08] Chad do you see my my Liney guide Wells
[01:14:10] Alex thank you for the Lenny guide wow
[01:14:12] is this thing 28 minutes of detailed
[01:14:15] Lenny advice with timestamps so I can go
[01:14:17] to the section I want wow that's insane
[01:14:19] I love the Lenny videos I ask thank you
[01:14:28] 28 minutes of plankshang Ling I didn't
[01:14:31] actually play shangling much did my
[01:14:32] showcase my showcase is literally
[01:14:34] literally litany
[01:14:37] bennetta like yeah Bennett Coswell haha
[01:14:40] everyone uses that shirt but there's Dan
[01:14:42] there true true they are true
[01:14:51] check 7 Minutes 12 in your guide why
[01:14:54] is there a Fielder but you will get
[01:14:57] interrupted a lot and won't be able to
[01:14:58] charge not as much and it can make
[01:15:00] playing him a living hell genuinely
[01:15:02] though wait what happened at 7 12.
[01:15:04] there's literally nothing
[01:15:06] is there a [ __ ] up
[01:15:07] we'll get interrupted a lot and won't be
[01:15:09] this is 7 12.
[01:15:11] touch and it can make playing him a
[01:15:13] living hell oh did I miss a shot wait
[01:15:15] but you will get I wasn't looking and
[01:15:16] won't be able to charge shot as much and
[01:15:18] it can okay yo why do you guys notice
[01:15:20] this [ __ ] off dude who is like watching
[01:15:24] the background footage trying to see
[01:15:25] dude [ __ ] off okay it auto Target
[01:15:28] anyways it didn't matter oh I missed it
[01:15:31] all right but he died yo okay his body
[01:15:34] wasn't gone but usually when you kill
[01:15:35] someone they disappear
[01:15:37] in-game his body was still there bro
[01:15:39] like
[01:15:41] really strong I know part of this is
[01:15:43] because dude that's not even a skill
[01:15:45] issue though that's just a little pyro
[01:15:46] damage with no reaction
[01:15:49] I am impressed
[01:15:52] honestly when I upload a 30 minute guide
[01:15:54] I'm like so afraid that I made a mistake
[01:15:56] that that being the thing you point out
[01:15:58] is like is happy it's like it's good
[01:16:01] but Lindy's pretty straightforward to be
[01:16:02] fair
[01:16:07] bro left it in dude genuinely though
[01:16:10] shut up okay actually
[01:16:12] trim the Showcase a lot because it was
[01:16:14] so long initially because I showed the
[01:16:15] whole part of me killing the [ __ ] PMA
[01:16:17] and like I didn't do anything wrong it's
[01:16:19] just the PMA is like he's [ __ ]
[01:16:21] annoying so I had to like I just put the
[01:16:23] last part because like dude it's he just
[01:16:25] goes invisible and [ __ ] it's like
[01:16:26] [ __ ] weird this is such a bad Abyss
[01:16:28] for Lenny but I love this part it was
[01:16:31] fine
[01:16:31] it's actually a lot of damage Lydia
[01:16:33] actually [ __ ] hurts
[01:16:37] it's so
[01:16:41] then he didn't [ __ ] die here so I had
[01:16:42] to like yeah fine
[01:16:45] or as Simon not PMA I always shut up you
[01:16:48] know what I mean
[01:16:51] can I wait for the hotel versus lady
[01:16:52] comparison video yes true
[01:16:54] I actually can't wait for that
[01:16:57] my favorite video was the the uh hutau
[01:17:00] versus yomiya where the hutao was doing
[01:17:03] one normal into a jump
[01:17:06] that was my favorite video I think
[01:17:13] the N1 n1j hutau
[01:17:17] wow guys your Mia is actually better
[01:17:20] all right
[01:17:21] um we're gonna play I play Lenny second
[01:17:23] half let's play him first half let's do
[01:17:25] Big L
[01:17:27] Big B
[01:17:29] small k
[01:17:31] and um we need Hydro for this floor
[01:17:34] usually don't play Hydro Lenny but we
[01:17:36] could do kokomi just why not oh we kind
[01:17:39] of want a shield though I don't need a
[01:17:40] shield like most people would need a
[01:17:42] shield I'm so good that I don't need a
[01:17:44] shield is my thesis uh we don't need a
[01:17:47] Healer though we could do like yelling
[01:17:49] foreign
[01:17:56] buff true
[01:17:59] sure
[01:18:01] where's where's child
[01:18:03] actually we'll do ayato because I might
[01:18:05] like low-key
[01:18:07] I can't charge shot without resistance
[01:18:09] interruption
[01:18:10] so after you like quick swap off the
[01:18:13] knee I'll probably DPS on Ito like not
[01:18:15] even kidding because like what am I
[01:18:16] gonna do charge shot against 18 Rift
[01:18:18] towns when you get [ __ ]
[01:18:20] and then second half will do
[01:18:23] why haven't I played in a while
[01:18:33] so I know I actually haven't played sign
[01:18:34] in a while I could play Sano
[01:18:45] Sino baiju where's byju
[01:18:50] fickle
[01:18:52] where's pickle
[01:18:54] I can't find her
[01:18:57] there it is she oh there she is
[01:19:00] uh and then
[01:19:04] she's on Rust oh [ __ ]
[01:19:10] why scarra level 80.
[01:19:13] why are you judging me
[01:19:17] what's wrong with level 80.
[01:19:25] okay huh
[01:19:35] he deserves better no the [ __ ] he
[01:19:37] doesn't I treat my scarra better look
[01:19:40] look your scar could be level 90 okay
[01:19:43] but that doesn't solve the fact that his
[01:19:45] crit ratio is an 86-13
[01:19:52] um I I just I listen
[01:19:56] I feed him well
[01:20:05] okay let's just go let's just go no more
[01:20:06] stalling Sino
[01:20:08] baiju fickle and then who do you want is
[01:20:12] the last lot we could do Elon but then I
[01:20:13] I like quick Loops I know I think we
[01:20:16] deal on she probably won't have enough

[01:25:01] character there's an ICD between well
[01:25:03] you can like Dash Dash and then you have
[01:25:04] to wait a bit before you can dash dash
[01:25:05] again so uh what happened there was I
[01:25:07] tried to I dashed and I tried to dodge
[01:25:08] my second Dash but then I noticed that
[01:25:10] the attack was coming later but I
[01:25:11] couldn't Dodge because there's an IC on
[01:25:12] the Dodge now you might be like oh but
[01:25:14] socks I've dashed multiple times in a
[01:25:15] row true but the way you can circumvent
[01:25:18] this ICD is by swapping characters
[01:25:19] because each character's Dash ICD is
[01:25:21] actually different so you can dash dash
[01:25:22] on Sino then swap divide you dash dash
[01:25:25] and swapped official dash dash missile
[01:25:26] on dash dash but what's Curious is if
[01:25:28] you swap back to Sino it'll still be on
[01:25:30] cooldown
[01:25:33] American if you swap it doesn't tick The
[01:25:36] Tick only ticks when you're on the
[01:25:37] character so let's say for example I
[01:25:39] dash dash then I swap to buy drug and
[01:25:41] dash ass instantly but then I go back to
[01:25:42] Sino since I swapped before the one
[01:25:45] Mississippi then I and I go back to Sino
[01:25:47] then you can't be dashed instantly
[01:25:51] look I'll show you dash dash I saw
[01:25:54] divided now I'm spamming right click
[01:25:55] it's not dashing see
[01:25:57] anyways
[01:26:10] actually yeah
[01:26:14] I got it
[01:26:20] yeah bro
[01:26:25] can this guy die
[01:26:43] okay yeah we are not to desire this
[01:26:48] is
[01:26:51] well I mean it wasn't even my fault okay
[01:26:54] it was my fault it was actually entirely
[01:26:56] my fault
[01:26:58] but I mean could I really have done
[01:27:01] better yes yes
[01:27:07] well I mean okay look look
[01:27:12] it's hot
[01:27:14] was it my fault yes however we don't
[01:27:17] have enough dendro on that team so we
[01:27:19] couldn't even aggravate even if I wanted
[01:27:20] to so it was a team diff it wasn't a me
[01:27:24] diff that is what happened so if I click
[01:27:26] on Sino here
[01:27:27] am I geared
[01:27:29] okay I actually have geared all right
[01:27:31] well I can't believe this I know let's
[01:27:32] just put more dendro let's just put more
[01:27:34] dendro
[01:27:35] let's just put more dendro
[01:27:40] okay so we're gonna do a big seat
[01:27:43] and then I like the heat up but the
[01:27:45] problem the heat up is you have to let's
[01:27:47] see like
[01:27:48] then there's a new wave of enemies you
[01:27:50] have to swap back into her but the thing
[01:27:51] is I probably don't want a Sino burst
[01:27:53] and then run to another set of enemies
[01:27:54] with sign over still active so it's fine
[01:27:56] then we do a Fickle and then yelling but
[01:27:59] then I don't have a Healer do I need
[01:28:00] each other no I'm talented true I I lied
[01:28:02] I want a Healer we'll do um
[01:28:05] we'll do slow Hydro [ __ ] it
[01:28:08] we'll do Soul Hydro
[01:28:20] kooky yeah but I don't like cookie I
[01:28:22] lied I like cookie okay final play
[01:28:24] cookie
[01:28:25] but then this is my hyphen team Bo signo
[01:28:29] it's just my I'll hide them team
[01:28:35] Pepe W team fine we can place intro
[01:28:37] actually I don't think he's geared never
[01:28:39] mind all right Lenny again
[01:28:47] foreign
[01:28:49] what the [ __ ] is slow Hydro listen
[01:28:53] so let's say you're playing Quicken
[01:28:54] right
[01:28:55] if you want to get the most quickens the
[01:28:57] most aggravates on your side note you
[01:28:59] don't really want to make the enemy wet
[01:29:01] because then it'll remove the Quicken
[01:29:02] Aura from them however if you have a
[01:29:05] little bit of hydro you can still get
[01:29:06] basically every Quicken you would
[01:29:07] otherwise get but if you have a fast
[01:29:09] Hydro it's like
[01:29:11] then you lose out on a lot of the
[01:29:13] quickens but you can make up for it by
[01:29:15] getting hyperlooms which are pretty
[01:29:17] broken so it's fine
[01:29:24] wow this was bad they didn't die in the
[01:29:26] first rotation wait no they did die oh
[01:29:28] no we're fine we're fine we're fine
[01:29:29] please die
[01:29:31] please die please
[01:29:34] okay he's dead
[01:29:43] I need two charger don't hit me one
[01:29:48] two e versus I bursted
[01:29:53] Dodge
[01:29:54] come inside the arch soup
[01:30:27] well that was awkward
[01:30:38] it's show time
[01:30:50] who do this
[01:30:56] I'm dead I'm dead I'm gonna just I'm
[01:30:58] chilling yeah [ __ ] that
[01:30:59] I'm not risking it stay in the air stay
[01:31:02] in the Middle look
[01:31:07] as soon as I see the return to move I
[01:31:09] Dodge
[01:31:11] swirl the Hydra onto the thing Bennett
[01:31:13] bowken then Boke in the neck broken then
[01:31:27] that was actually good
[01:31:29] now for some sinusy here's what we're
[01:31:32] gonna do
[01:31:33] we're gonna hit up
[01:31:36] oh yeah we're in Japanese well that's
[01:31:37] what she said in English translation I
[01:31:39] translated for you call me the
[01:31:40] translator then we're gonna use Sino
[01:31:43] can't take a lot of shoes I know I'm
[01:31:44] just gonna need
[01:31:54] it
[01:32:02] kooky I love you isn't that a Drake song
[01:32:07] Kiki Kiki
[01:32:17] no
[01:32:20] leave the hydro slime Maloney monster
[01:32:31] optimize Sino rotation Mash key on your
[01:32:34] keyboard and it'll line up no I didn't
[01:32:40] if you have Proctor would have worked
[01:32:43] are you [ __ ]

[01:40:41] have fun with this game
[01:40:46] let's go over here
[01:40:50] attack
[01:40:54] [ __ ] I can't hit both of them at the
[01:40:56] same time
[01:41:00] oh my God sorry sorry uh I just killed
[01:41:03] one I just killed one I just killed
[01:41:08] easy to carry
[01:41:13] not a bad clear true
[01:41:16] all right nice
[01:41:20] that wasn't even bad were you guys
[01:41:21] someone tied to one hour of this run it
[01:41:23] literally was like two minutes
[01:41:26] watch I'm gonna I'm gonna watch this
[01:41:28] watch a shot you don't even know what
[01:41:29] I'm aiming for until I hit it
[01:41:33] see I hit it
[01:41:35] true
[01:41:37] there's any second off we did many
[01:41:39] second off two or three times already
[01:41:40] last stream not the Stream
[01:41:42] what the [ __ ] is this
[01:41:49] is
[01:41:51] Lynette better than ayato as a character
[01:41:54] no but if you're talking about in a
[01:41:56] Lenny team kind of you don't want to run
[01:41:57] Lenny with Hydro the only reason I
[01:42:00] played him with hydros because this
[01:42:01] Abyss is bad for the knee so you kind of
[01:42:02] need specific elements right like Lenny
[01:42:05] themes are like Lenny Bennett then flex
[01:42:07] and then your last thought is also Flex
[01:42:09] so it's like
[01:42:11] foreign
[01:42:15] or like something like that or shangling
[01:42:18] and then Shield
[01:42:26] have you fought Vivian yet who the [ __ ]
[01:42:29] is Vivian is that the hydro buff dude we
[01:42:31] killed we beat him uh but I didn't know
[01:42:34] it was like a boss or something
[01:42:38] are there aren't there multiple though
[01:42:41] there's another one where I actually
[01:42:43] want to kill them all how many are there
[01:42:44] where do they respawn can I like Target
[01:42:47] dummy them because one of them was over
[01:42:48] here the one I thought was like here
[01:42:50] like there
[01:42:54] there's like seven geez
[01:42:57] once a day really
[01:43:01] north of ellenis
[01:43:04] like here or oh wait this looks like
[01:43:06] suspicious territory isn't there
[01:43:12] this looks like that's a boss
[01:43:17] on the island
[01:43:19] oh like one of these
[01:43:21] how the [ __ ] do I get there though
[01:43:26] all right let's just go
[01:43:28] then we'll spend all of our resin I
[01:43:29] think I need them because there's some
[01:43:30] energy for that though because that's
[01:43:31] gonna be content
[01:43:38] I need these
[01:43:46] are trying link for Lenny team honestly
[01:43:48] both are either doesn't really matter
[01:43:50] like you're like best team if you don't
[01:43:53] need a shield as both but usually you
[01:43:54] need a [ __ ] Shield so you would
[01:43:55] replace I like kazua
[01:43:58] uh because you can group and like
[01:44:02] I mean both are fine honestly they're
[01:44:04] both good if you need Kaza for your
[01:44:06] other team then use Casa for other team
[01:44:08] like here I've had causal I would swirl
[01:44:09] all three and they'd die but now I don't
[01:44:11] have Cosmo so I'm kind of just like
[01:44:12] magic I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm
[01:44:13] gonna do
[01:44:16] I have to kill this guy before against
[01:44:17] the Shield I have to kill this guy
[01:44:18] before The Shield
[01:44:22] oh okay well this game sucks
[01:44:39] all right cool
[01:44:43] the [ __ ] is this I don't I'm just gonna
[01:44:45] go did I miss the draw I feel like I
[01:44:47] missed a drop
[01:44:50] why is your webcam so clear today it's
[01:44:52] just lighting I think
[01:44:53] this guy dude this guy's just this guy's

[01:50:33] kill these guys it's probably like a
[01:50:35] [ __ ] Quest or some [ __ ] but maybe
[01:50:37] it's just an achievement um

[01:54:16] you better say hi you better be say hi
[01:54:18] or they'll be sad
[01:54:27] I wouldn't I wouldn't
[01:54:29] I would never

[01:54:42] actually my favorite animal
[01:54:46] um [ __ ] it single pole
[01:54:49] I'm gonna double skip though
[01:54:52] okay well
[01:54:55] show any build please it's not good you
[01:54:58] want magic well it's good but it's not
[01:55:00] on my way you want formatting to see
[01:55:03] um but I mean I have two two just
[01:55:05] because I don't really care right now
[01:55:06] well it's not because I don't care it's
[01:55:08] because I haven't farmed the news I mean
[01:55:09] so
[01:55:14] so we're gonna Farm it now and hopefully
[01:55:16] we can gear
[01:55:18] our RR Lenny
[01:55:25] pew
[01:55:31] foreign
[01:55:37] okay
[01:55:38] so what do I want to do am I doing it
[01:55:40] all today
[01:55:41] do I even have enough condensed resin
[01:55:44] I mean enough butterflies
[01:55:46] maybe I should get Crystal flies
[01:55:50] I'm gonna just send it we'll see like
[01:55:51] how many we can do today we don't have
[01:55:52] to do everything but we can do as many
[01:55:54] as we can
[01:56:11] wait how does the wait does the crystal
[01:56:12] fly how does the crystal fly like Gadget
[01:56:14] work the Trap thing
[01:56:20] it's dog [ __ ] oh wow
[01:56:23] unfortune
[01:56:29] take six days to get 15 of them I mean
[01:56:33] it also takes six days to manually
[01:56:35] collect 15 of them so I guess I'll take
[01:56:37] it but why is there such a big cooldown
[01:56:40] what do you have to do for it it costs
[01:56:42] 30 or wait which ores the blue ones no
[01:56:44] way it better not be the [ __ ] blue
[01:56:46] ones
[01:56:49] oh any ores okay then it's fine oh it's
[01:56:52] not good but like it's better than
[01:56:53] nothing I guess oh I would do it if it
[01:56:55] costs the iron ones
[01:56:58] because like that's like if it's yeah
[01:57:00] it's like passively for no [ __ ] you if I
[01:57:03] don't get this Crystal fly no one does
[01:57:07] I got it
[01:57:16] it respawns if you don't kill it I don't
[01:57:18] want it anymore
[01:57:24] I turned it into a cat
[01:57:27] [ __ ] I did if I had a Kazo did I need to
[01:57:29] pull for Cosmo man I don't know how I
[01:57:31] don't have Cosmo still
[01:57:37] okay
[01:57:43] does even know you could kill them yeah
[01:57:45] if you try to chase after them first
[01:57:46] like with scarra you'll accidentally
[01:57:48] kill them all the time it's kind of
[01:57:49] funny no okay
[01:57:53] is this a skill issue I don't know I
[01:57:55] actually don't know how
[01:57:59] maybe I have no stamina and it's like
[01:58:17] dude leaks what the [ __ ] Inazuma isn't
[01:58:19] out yet okay true my bad I'm sorry I'm
[01:58:22] sorry we're still waiting I'm sorry
[01:58:25] okay let's go do Fontan then the the
[01:58:27] older region
[01:58:34] where the hoodie from
[01:58:38] hoodie it was a birthday gift Fang
[01:58:40] designed it isn't it cool there's a jade
[01:58:41] spear on my [ __ ] no this is Charles
[01:58:43] tattoos all right there's a JSP on this
[01:58:44] let's see pretty lit I'm actually at the
[01:58:46] start of the stream I'm not gonna stand
[01:58:47] up now [ __ ] you Frick you
[01:58:49] frick
[01:58:51] I need to do my weekly missions because
[01:58:54] I actually care about getting the battle
[01:58:55] pass weapon afap as fast as possible I
[01:58:58] want I really think the Trident looks
[01:59:00] cool but I'm probably not gonna use this
[01:59:02] I mean I'll use it on like hutau but I
[01:59:04] have homo I'm amazed on shangly no I
[01:59:06] won't I'm not gonna use this but I would
[01:59:07] use this actually reverse belt Rosario
[01:59:09] can use this no there's two types in
[01:59:11] that team not three okay what's another
[01:59:13] character
[01:59:16] uh yeah no one but I'm gonna use this
[01:59:19] for sure so I'm gonna get wolfang first
[01:59:21] Sino but I have a signature
[01:59:24] I have sinus okay I I will say good
[01:59:26] point it could actually be really good
[01:59:28] on Sino
[01:59:29] true but I already have signed a
[01:59:31] signature weapon so
[01:59:57] I'm gonna get one of each I'm not gonna
[01:59:59] refine at first because if I'm gonna buy
[02:00:01] the bypass I might as well get one of
[02:00:02] each so I would do this and this and
[02:00:03] this and this or I'll do this first then
[02:00:06] the spear then the bow and then these
[02:00:07] two Talking Stick is so [ __ ] I hate
[02:00:10] this weapon but it looks the name is
[02:00:12] funny so
[02:00:14] um
[02:00:16] but I'm gonna get wolfang first
[02:00:19] one of my lights just died
[02:00:33] oh you
[02:00:38] yeah
[02:00:40] you
[02:00:41] hold it
[02:00:44] as well fine good on a lot of characters
[02:00:46] especially like basically okay think of
[02:00:49] it this way black sword is like it's
[02:00:52] good but like it's you rarely use it
[02:00:55] because it's mostly for characters that
[02:00:56] normal or chargeback right where the
[02:00:57] [ __ ] what the hot what's the hockey for
[02:00:58] battle pass okay there it is but
[02:01:01] um um for Carrick for other sword
[02:01:03] characters that don't normal charge hack
[02:01:05] or that have a bigger chunk of their
[02:01:07] damage come from skill or burst boom
[02:01:09] well thing so like I'll hide the normal
[02:01:10] attacks but there's a lot more of his
[02:01:13] damage that comes from a skill
[02:01:18] uh and so this is like a lot of stats
[02:01:23] who's the Catalyst good for did I surely
[02:01:26] someone knew because this [ __ ] is weird
[02:01:33] probably a new character no no leaks but
[02:01:36] I don't know like it's really weird
[02:01:43] foreign
[02:01:57] gives you a lot of attack which is good
[02:01:59] and energy but if you're like if you
[02:02:02] don't need energy and can fit the crit
[02:02:03] rate then sure but it's a lot of credit
[02:02:05] because you also get create on the
[02:02:06] effect so like you'll get whatever the
[02:02:08] [ __ ] it is that level uh 90 which is
[02:02:11] like 24 something wait what's black
[02:02:14] sword at 90.
[02:02:16] 20 something 27.
[02:02:19] yeah 27.6 so it'll be 27.6 crit rate and
[02:02:23] then the effect depending on your
[02:02:24] refinement will give you more right
[02:02:25] so it Stacks four times two percent two
[02:02:28] times four is eight but I'm assuming
[02:02:29] it's double this that are five and five
[02:02:30] so it's like it's a lot of crit rate
[02:02:32] you're probably gonna overcap if you're
[02:02:33] playing an ayaka
[02:02:42] dude just go in the domain okay okay I'm
[02:02:44] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[02:02:46] sorry I'm sorry
[02:02:48] okay
[02:02:49] so
[02:02:54] hey how are you doing
[02:02:58] I'm good thanks for asking
[02:03:04] oh before I start Chad how much resin
[02:03:07] are we spending so I did the math uh of
[02:03:09] how much resin I have now and then 78
[02:03:12] times 60.
[02:03:14] which um if I do it again I don't know
[02:03:17] if I'm gonna spend all 78 but let's just
[02:03:19] assume we do I also get more from the
[02:03:20] battle pass so I could probably round it
[02:03:21] up to 80. but let's say it's like let's
[02:03:23] say 75 right let's say 75 times 60.
[02:03:25] that's 4 500 resin then I have 400 right
[02:03:28] now plus five condensed which is uh 200
[02:03:31] plus uh uh uh uh uh refreshes let's say
[02:03:35] another thousand this is over 5K resin
[02:03:37] minimum minimum over 5K we could
[02:03:39] probably get six if we want but let's
[02:03:41] just say 5K
[02:03:43] so we can definitely spend at least 5K
[02:03:46] resin on this domain if we want to
[02:03:49] which I think is quite poggers
[02:03:52] also I just got my new birthday cake
[02:03:54] oh we got a resin
[02:03:57] plus one plus one because I gotta yup
[02:03:59] true
[02:04:04] yes
[02:04:11] whoa I just got a key from the new
[02:04:13] region that's yo no way
[02:04:17] um that's dope
[02:04:23] anyways so
[02:04:28] wait let me hydrate
[02:04:31] okay
[02:04:35] today what we are doing is simple
[02:04:38] Fontaine gave us a new domain pretty
[02:04:39] broken we got two sets which is French
[02:04:43] derogatory but really good on Xiao
[02:04:45] Linney
[02:04:46] and probably future characters
[02:04:51] Golden Corral
[02:04:53] which is good for
[02:04:57] I was reveal myself
[02:04:59] official yai Albedo some other
[02:05:01] characters that no one likes I didn't
[02:05:03] say that but it's pretty good
[02:05:06] hello Jeff
[02:05:07] so we're gonna spend five thousand resin
[02:05:09] on this new domain and hopefully we can
[02:05:11] build our lady build our visual those
[02:05:12] are the characters I really care about
[02:05:13] now you'll be like sucks what about ciao
[02:05:15] listen
[02:05:16] if I get a better Xiao Marie said than
[02:05:20] Vermillion after spending over a hundred
[02:05:22] thousand resin on Vermillion there's
[02:05:24] gonna be a video about that soon
[02:05:25] then I will be upset
[02:05:29] and I will scream but outside of that
[02:05:31] we're just gonna farm this domain I
[02:05:33] really want a good set from it or two
[02:05:34] good sets from it so we'll be going I
[02:05:37] have uh
[02:05:40] basically 80 fragile resume we have 79
[02:05:42] five condensed I also currently have 400
[02:05:45] because the president of a foreign
[02:05:47] Nation gave it to me as a gift because I
[02:05:50] I helped save their economy and their
[02:05:52] people they were grateful for me no big
[02:05:54] deal it's just that something I do every
[02:05:55] day so uh just saying uh and we can
[02:05:57] refresh if we want to but you know I'm
[02:05:59] free to play I'm not but I could be
[02:06:00] anyways so we have over 5000 resin that
[02:06:04] we're gonna spend on this domain
[02:06:06] I'm gonna say today but
[02:06:09] if it takes if it's like it's been two
[02:06:10] three hours I'm tired I might do half
[02:06:12] today half the next day doesn't matter
[02:06:13] I'll be one video so it doesn't matter
[02:06:15] but it might be over the course of two
[02:06:16] days it might be one day it might be
[02:06:17] three I don't know but that's what we're
[02:06:19] doing
[02:06:20] cool
[02:06:22] yeah I can't wait if I get an animal
[02:06:25] goblet with crit rate and crit damage
[02:06:27] before I get one on Vermillion you
[02:06:29] actually don't under I will wake up my
[02:06:31] neighbors I will become a YouTube
[02:06:33] prankster I will cut my neighbors at 5am
[02:06:35] gone wrong you'll see watch see what
[02:06:37] happens
[02:06:38] so hopefully that doesn't happen
[02:06:41] hopefully I don't throw my career down
[02:06:43] the drain uh so uh yeah
[02:06:46] oh also in case you're wondering
[02:06:49] the artifacts because we're spending
[02:06:51] like five characters in everything we
[02:06:53] get from here we're gonna save all the
[02:06:55] five stars that are like bad we're gonna
[02:06:56] save and then a bit later we'll do we'll
[02:06:58] throw them in the strong box for another
[02:07:00] video which will either be Vermillion or
[02:07:01] emblem now if I'm smart it'll be emblem
[02:07:04] if I'm
[02:07:06] being honest it's probably gonna be
[02:07:08] Vermillion so yeah
[02:07:11] probably over a million but it'd be cool
[02:07:12] if we did emblem that'd be cool that'd
[02:07:14] be an idea
[02:07:24] um okay we're about to start but a few
[02:07:26] things before we start first we need to
[02:07:27] make sure we have a team that can clear
[02:07:29] and a team that needs friendship because
[02:07:30] we don't want to waste the Friendship XP
[02:07:32] that's one two
[02:07:34] um I know Chad wanted to gamble but I
[02:07:36] don't know what we could gamble on
[02:07:37] normally would I grind about your
[02:07:38] domains I like to if I'm being like
[02:07:40] smart I'll like stockpile them inventory
[02:07:42] then check them all at once but I don't
[02:07:44] want to do that now because if this is
[02:07:47] gonna be made into a video I think it's
[02:07:48] better content
[02:07:50] if I'm checking the artifacts along the
[02:07:52] way and then I level them all at the end
[02:07:55] does that make sense
[02:07:58] actually I should probably record that
[02:08:01] oh and I'm gonna check the artifacts as
[02:08:03] we go and then level them all at the end
[02:08:05] wow that was sounded natural that wasn't
[02:08:09] so yeah I think that's what we're gonna
[02:08:10] do
[02:08:13] um
[02:08:17] yeah I don't know how canvas would work
[02:08:18] but I think we're gonna do that my Lenny
[02:08:20] you should be good enough my Lynette I
[02:08:22] wish he was a bit stronger but she's
[02:08:24] decent I just need to ascend her
[02:08:27] um we could play Bennett and then I want
[02:08:28] another character that needs friendship
[02:08:29] I don't know who does Hazel need is
[02:08:32] there a part Dale please don't be
[02:08:33] friends for 10 days please there please
[02:08:35] [ __ ]
[02:08:37] um do I have a shield or that's not
[02:08:38] French or ten Kirara
[02:08:42] cool we can play QR
[02:08:45] you should help
[02:08:52] is the Jeff still here at the jeff37
[02:08:55] it's not here
[02:08:58] um
[02:08:59] what's up a Content idea there is an
[02:09:02] enemy in font 10 that is like a world
[02:09:04] boss called Vivian of the lake do not
[02:09:06] underestimate it oh we already killed it
[02:09:08] okay for attack but yeah it was funny
[02:09:11] when I found out to the Fontaine weapon
[02:09:14] Ascension mats domain area your Xiao is
[02:09:17] a weakling against it
[02:09:20] uh we killed Vivian and we killed Minion
[02:09:22] or whatever the name is ninyan or some
[02:09:25] [ __ ]
[02:09:26] oh this is probably gonna be made into a
[02:09:27] video but uh it might be over the course
[02:09:30] of a few things so like it is what it is
[02:09:37] let's put Kirara in here
[02:09:41] where's Kirara
[02:09:44] kiwawa
[02:09:46] am I blind
[02:09:47] dude what calm down she's probably level
[02:09:50] 90 so she's at the top okay she ditches
[02:09:55] dude I can't believe shadow looks like
[02:09:56] this in the party menu that's so sick

[02:10:31] okay
[02:10:33] all right let's go with this team boom
[02:10:35] I'm playing burning oh
[02:10:39] definitely a reaction of all time
[02:10:54] well I have no energy
[02:11:03] all right let's see how fast we include
[02:11:04] this we're gonna do it well I need
[02:11:05] energy first but
[02:11:07] I probably should play Cosmo I just need
[02:11:09] friendship XP so
[02:11:17] at least on the bright side QR Shield is
[02:11:19] really [ __ ] strong so
[02:11:26] okay well I don't want to use my e but I
[02:11:27] probably should
[02:11:29] well

[02:11:42] don't
[02:11:45] I'm just trying to see what I'm that's
[02:11:47] fine
[02:11:50] lesson learned I don't need to save e
[02:11:57] this clear time um dude shut the [ __ ] up
[02:12:00] we're playing a friendship team and I
[02:12:02] wanted to see if I needed to use my
[02:12:04] skill or not okay this was the first
[02:12:06] clear of many this was one out of like a
[02:12:09] thousand so let it be known we have
[02:12:11] officially commenced the marriage grind
[02:12:25] what does om stand for uh it is organic
[02:12:29] methodology
[02:12:34] no it's a remote you can see it above my
[02:12:36] head and if you can't see it in chat
[02:12:38] download an extension it's not download
[02:12:39] just add an extension to your browser
[02:12:41] called 7tv
[02:12:42] which is free and takes like two clicks
[02:12:44] okay watch it we do this then the shield

[02:17:04] dude just wait till Genji lets me import
[02:17:06] my sensitivity like imagine you have
[02:17:07] like actual sensitivity settings in this

[02:17:42] another for good measure and because my
[02:17:45] birthday is here happy birthday
[02:17:54] what can you help fix my hotel she only
[02:17:56] has 1K 2 attack
[02:18:02] okay are you asking are you saying your
[02:18:05] hotel's attack is too low
[02:18:08] does
[02:18:13] hutao does not need attack
[02:18:21] uh if you would like more information
[02:18:23] you can watch my hotel guide but hutau
[02:18:26] wants HP and Elemental Mastery and crit
[02:18:29] rate and crit damage
[02:18:30] he doesn't need attack her skill will
[02:18:33] give her a bunch of attack
[02:18:39] wait let me try another team uh
[02:18:53] crew
[02:19:03] sounds that you can do 10 condensed
[02:19:04] resin no no I just had 400 resin I don't
[02:19:07] know why a foreign president gave it to
[02:19:09] me I can't expose who it is though uh
[02:19:12] for legal reasons
[02:19:22] is it
[02:19:23] yeah
[02:19:38] that was a lot faster
[02:19:43] maybe bringing shout into this domain
[02:19:45] will give us a good shot set and then we
[02:19:48] get this set before Vermillion nope okay
[02:19:50] we still didn't all good
[02:19:58] hey
[02:20:03] bro didn't use Lenny yes I did look
[02:20:08] see there's a cat thing
[02:20:10] watches
[02:20:21] do we do this
[02:20:23] on this then this
[02:20:25] then this
[02:20:26] sorry
[02:20:31] and then this
[02:20:32] see a lending team
[02:20:36] 39 seconds
[02:20:40] boom Oh
[02:20:42] sorry that's weird I forgot this was
[02:20:44] gonna be a video oh yes
[02:20:46] we got a nice feather
[02:20:49] I mean this yeah this could be good
[02:20:52] and wait but this is Matty she'll say oh
[02:20:53] good for the knee good for the knee
[02:20:57] oh I should probably add
[02:20:58] disclaimer Lenny doesn't want crit rate
[02:21:02] that much with this set I mean most
[02:21:03] characters of the set don't really want
[02:21:04] to crit rate so like crit damage and
[02:21:06] attack are a lot better
[02:21:09] um not a lot better but yeah so yeah
[02:21:12] still really good this looks nice
[02:21:15] oh wait what the [ __ ]
[02:21:22] yo
[02:21:25] okay well that's two good pieces maybe
[02:21:27] maybe we never
[02:21:30] count your chickens before they hatch
[02:21:31] never account your artifacts before they
[02:21:34] roll so we're not gonna say they're good
[02:21:36] yet we're gonna say they are rollable
[02:21:39] and they have potential
[02:21:43] Chad I have a question try it put a time
[02:21:46] stamp every time I get a good artifact
[02:21:48] It's that or should I like should I ding
[02:21:52] dong and then track my editor in a cell
[02:21:54] and make him watch the whole VOD
[02:21:59] this
[02:22:03] um well
[02:22:06] we'll see
[02:22:09] go again
[02:22:13] not it'll only have two time stamps [ __ ]
[02:22:16] you
[02:22:18] my Lotus 2.3k attack is that good yeah
[02:22:20] man yeah you might want a bit more
[02:22:25] why don't you have Lindy's bow I don't
[02:22:27] pull for every character's weapons uh I
[02:22:28] do think this Bender is tempting I'm
[02:22:30] actually kind of tempted but when I was
[02:22:31] about to because I think it looks cool
[02:22:32] too when I was about to like I was
[02:22:34] debating pulling for it I was like wait
[02:22:36] a second I'm probably gonna main at
[02:22:39] least from the Fontana characters either
[02:22:40] never yet or Risley and they're both
[02:22:42] coming like very soon so I should
[02:22:45] probably just I'm probably gonna pull
[02:22:47] for one of their weapons so I shouldn't
[02:22:48] pull for every [ __ ] character's
[02:22:50] weapons so I'm gonna skip this one
[02:22:51] better I think
[02:22:53] and then I only put like I don't pull on
[02:22:55] like I pull sometimes
[02:23:02] how about chlorine d uh we'll have to
[02:23:05] see how she plays I think she looks
[02:23:06] really cool
[02:23:07] like her I like her design but we'll
[02:23:09] have to like I don't like we don't know
[02:23:10] what she does or anything so we'll see
[02:23:15] I definitely like her though but the
[02:23:17] last
[02:23:18] the last
[02:23:20] how do I say this
[02:23:22] the last
[02:23:25] character
[02:23:29] the last male character I sent for was
[02:23:31] I'll hythm then he came out and I was
[02:23:33] very happy and he was great the last
[02:23:36] woman I SIM for was Daya and then she
[02:23:39] came out
[02:23:41] so I have no expectations but
[02:23:57] it's show time
[02:24:08] what I feel so slow
[02:24:12] my jumps are I'm like pressing spacebar
[02:24:15] oh whatever maybe I'm I was gonna say
[02:24:17] maybe I'm missing the timing but like I
[02:24:18] feel like I've played Shao enough to
[02:24:20] know the timing
[02:24:21] keep that away
[02:24:33] um this could be okay these could be
[02:24:34] good there's potential there's potential
[02:24:35] we're gonna log them it's a new set you
[02:24:37] can't have that high standards on a new
[02:24:39] set
[02:24:40] because then you end up just having bad
[02:24:42] artifacts so we're gonna lock them we're
[02:24:43] gonna lock them we're gonna lock them
[02:24:47] this could be good flat defense
[02:24:49] okay
[02:24:51] that can't be good
[02:24:57] what is someone called they are ugly
[02:24:58] what do you not have eyes that's okay
[02:25:01] now you can cure bad taste but like
[02:25:05] surely you've learned at this age of
[02:25:07] your life that your taste is bad
[02:25:26] there is no way you said that
[02:25:32] foreign
[02:25:39] ugly kid maybe yeah maybe maybe that's
[02:25:41] what they meant
[02:25:59] all right let me go uh craft some
[02:26:02] condensed resin
[02:26:06] that was a lot of uh tragedies
[02:26:09] oh here this thing down
[02:26:23] okay
[02:26:38] where the [ __ ] is this domain
[02:26:41] official guide please it'll be out
[02:26:43] after it'll be out in like a week
[02:26:45] probably
[02:26:46] I'm recording it after Lynette's done
[02:26:48] I'm recording official next it's not
[02:26:49] hard it's just I have to do it so yeah
[02:26:57] Navia will make Geo great again
[02:27:02] yeah
[02:27:03] of course
[02:27:05] surely
[02:27:07] that is some next level copium
[02:27:30] that's it all right no what the [ __ ] you
[02:27:34] can dash off that
[02:27:37] oh
[02:27:41] why the [ __ ] can you dash off that
[02:27:44] oh boy I sure hope we get something good
[02:27:57] it's gonna be good for officials she
[02:27:58] wants em as well could be good this one
[02:28:00] technically could be good for like but
[02:28:01] who doesn't want the set virgin hotel
[02:28:03] might but I'm not playing virgin without
[02:28:05] Maybe
[02:28:10] okay seriously though this set surely is
[02:28:12] going to be good on everyone soon surely
[02:28:13] surely they're gonna make this egg good
[02:28:15] on everyone surely surely surely Fontan
[02:28:18] characters are gonna be like oh my own
[02:28:19] HP is drained and then they gain damage
[02:28:22] true
[02:28:39] where the [ __ ] are we dude
[02:28:47] mama
[02:29:08] is navient gonna be good listen I he how
[02:29:12] would I know but also look at him
[02:29:14] there's no way he's not good there's
[02:29:16] literally no way he's not gonna be good
[02:29:18] look at how heighten I like them's
[02:29:21] cracked
[02:29:25] but there's more to a character than how
[02:29:28] good they are
[02:29:29] true this could be good although curate
[02:29:31] on the set is kind of copium
[02:29:33] oh God damn it
[02:29:37] this could be good no it can't no it
[02:29:40] can't let's just go again
[02:29:47] oh
[02:29:49] how the hell does someone you how the
[02:29:51] hell does one use hydro MC by the way oh
[02:29:53] that's the funny part you don't
[02:29:57] yeah
[02:29:59] I think the best city is hydro MC is you
[02:30:02] want to go to a statue of the seven in
[02:30:04] sumeru and then resonate with it and
[02:30:06] then you'll do a lot more damage
[02:30:18] coconut
[02:30:27] oh oh my oh wait could actually be good
[02:30:30] it could actually be good hiker damage
[02:30:31] on a set though oh for the record this
[02:30:33] set is kind of like okay when you're
[02:30:35] playing Magic with Lenny it's kind of
[02:30:36] like icon business right here so you you
[02:30:38] start with like 60 crit rate on both
[02:30:40] because Lydia has crit Ascension too so
[02:30:42] it like adds up to 60. so
[02:30:44] in Theory Game Theory you want like the
[02:30:46] same stats as you'd want on business
[02:30:48] right which means crit damage very very
[02:30:49] good
[02:30:51] okay that sucks
[02:30:55] I guess having cope it's literally true
[02:30:59] is your Shadow on vivita swirl pyro no
[02:31:01] my shot was on Vermilion to carry
[02:31:17] episodes
[02:31:19] you can't carry with your Vermillion
[02:31:21] dude my vermilions actually good now
[02:31:25] actually
[02:31:28] no no
[02:31:32] no
[02:31:33] no
[02:31:36] dude look at this feather we just got
[02:31:40] look at it
[02:31:49] look at the science look at this goblet
[02:31:52] look at this circlet these are all great
[02:31:55] it's just this one it's kind of yeah I
[02:31:57] mean it's 20 I mean it is what it is but
[02:32:00] we'll get a better flower soon
[02:32:03] mid Circle that is not a mid-circlet you
[02:32:07] are trolling if you think that's a
[02:32:08] mid-circuit
[02:32:12] this is a mid-circuit but we can still
[02:32:14] get credit Mitch or even like
[02:32:16] that's copium but like
[02:32:18] CR would be good that's fine can't be
[02:32:20] picky
[02:32:24] 30.6 trade rate is mid no okay for a
[02:32:27] hundred thousand resin that we spend
[02:32:28] sure but as is as a circuit that is not
[02:32:31] mid what the [ __ ] are you saying
[02:32:42] get anything
[02:32:53] I'll kill him
[02:33:00] oh what do they say
[02:33:02] uh can you bless me I'm not feeling well
[02:33:05] oh
[02:33:07] um well
[02:33:11] okay wait why why so much
[02:33:16] guys guys okay it listen it's funny when
[02:33:20] I say it but why when there's a first
[02:33:23] time chatter saying hello waving hand
[02:33:25] emoji I'm you here all of you say run
[02:33:28] okay well one person said welcome but
[02:33:31] okay yeah that's not that's [ __ ] that's
[02:33:34] actually [ __ ] that's actually [ __ ]
[02:33:35] where would they go literally where
[02:33:37] would they go
[02:33:44] I would argue this is the normalest
[02:33:46] stream you could be in
[02:33:48] it's like the lesser of evils
[02:33:53] [ __ ]
[02:33:55] look would any other streamer do this
[02:33:58] yeah 1200 resin
[02:34:06] okay look okay disclaimer disclaimer to
[02:34:09] the YouTube viewers
[02:34:13] we are spending like 5 000 resin today
[02:34:15] on this domain
[02:34:16] my resin being capped is temporary I
[02:34:19] promise it's just for effect I think it
[02:34:20] looks cooler it's a better like like
[02:34:22] image it's a better visual
[02:34:23] representation thumbnail whatever you
[02:34:26] want to call it if I just
[02:34:38] thank you
[02:34:44] are you gonna tell us Drake gave you
[02:34:46] this now
[02:34:51] I literally can't even do more by the
[02:34:53] way
[02:34:55] I promise I don't count my resin
[02:34:56] normally it's just for the to prove that
[02:34:59] I'm
[02:35:00] no more no more but it's just the proof
[02:35:02] that I'm all in like I'm not like
[02:35:03] half-assing this I'm not gonna be like
[02:35:04] oh yeah oh I don't actually care no no
[02:35:07] no no no we're all in rolling rolling
[02:35:10] literally lying what are you talking
[02:35:12] about
[02:35:21] sorry
[02:35:21] what's that sound I just made hopefully
[02:35:23] I might cut it out
[02:35:25] hopefully my mic didn't pick that up
[02:35:38] see you in the Fontan Court why why
[02:35:42] would you see me there
[02:35:43] maybe he has a judge I could be a judge
[02:35:47] I could just play Kazo here I guess and
[02:35:49] then we could play like a linear team
[02:35:53] I mean I could do Ben 10 I mean I mean
[02:35:57] Zhang Lee
[02:36:07] who's Ben 10 Bennett but we already have
[02:36:09] him on the team
[02:36:19] all right we're ready let's go
[02:36:21] Focus up silence
[02:36:26] I'm putting on Lydia and Lynette they're
[02:36:28] they're definitely characters
[02:36:30] they're I'm pretty happy with them I
[02:36:32] think Vinnie's really good Linette is
[02:36:33] like a she's a decent Triple Play option
[02:36:35] like I'm not like she's not
[02:36:38] she's very like catered towards
[02:36:41] um
[02:36:43] Fontan content
[02:36:48] [ __ ] he didn't die
[02:36:49] [ __ ] okay they did die
[02:36:58] I like his Japanese video a lot English
[02:37:00] one's also blade so I guess I like both
[02:37:02] but yeah
[02:37:04] I think it sounds cool
[02:37:10] the constellations C1 gives you a little
[02:37:12] bit of grouping it's not the most but it
[02:37:14] helps actually quite convenient uh C2
[02:37:16] will give you a little bit more damage
[02:37:17] on your burst more Elemental application
[02:37:18] too which is quite nice uh and then C4
[02:37:21] will give you a little stay in the
[02:37:23] middle a little bit of uh no it gives
[02:37:24] you an extra charge on your skill so
[02:37:26] that's actually quite nice because your
[02:37:27] skill does hit quite a bit uh and then
[02:37:29] C6 I forget what it does oh no it gives
[02:37:31] you a cosmo C6 which is kind of whatever
[02:37:33] but it's fun so it's a new play style if
[02:37:34] you like it you're welcome
[02:37:38] Mommy
[02:37:41] magic starts
[02:37:50] I don't want to use my skill if I don't
[02:37:52] have to because I want to use it on
[02:37:53] these guys
[02:37:55] let me suck them up
[02:37:56] that we bend it eat then we I don't need
[02:37:59] benef
[02:38:17] use it
[02:38:19] but then you would want a lot more crit
[02:38:21] than uh attack
[02:38:24] okay okay
[02:38:26] this could be good maybe make it correct
[02:38:39] isn't Lenny just red physical DPS
[02:38:44] I mean yes but you can swirl it
[02:38:48] uh but yes
[02:38:51] sure I guess
[02:39:13] mom we [ __ ] him up

[02:44:41] then we swirl these guys then we it's

[02:45:15] dude you literally just want to create
[02:45:16] damage Circle we've got a four star one
[02:45:17] but I'm sure that in 5000 resin we'll
[02:45:19] get a good Diamond circuit so it's fine
[02:45:25] lock the HP goblet what
[02:45:29] wait what did I have a good who
[02:45:33] oh
[02:45:34] it has to be leaks
[02:45:38] if I had no [ __ ] sub stats shut up
[02:45:44] we lock things with good substance
[02:45:54] I'm not doubting the fact that HP could
[02:45:56] be useful it probably will in Fontan for
[02:45:58] sure however I'm not gonna lock it if
[02:46:01] the sub stats are poop
[02:46:05] [ __ ]
[02:46:17] okay
[02:46:19] okay
[02:46:34] level is your Lenny eight six eight
[02:46:46] I have to do that again ow
[02:46:51] this guy doesn't have a weak one right
[02:47:09] did the [ __ ] taunt actually carried
[02:47:16] why the robot so thick though looking
[02:47:22] what
[02:47:30] excuse me
[02:47:42] as long as you don't hold my posture
[02:47:43] check
[02:47:47] look at this posture you've never seen
[02:47:50] someone sit so straight in your life
[02:47:51] literally ever
[02:47:55] look at this posture
[02:48:06] yes we didn't even swirl them okay it's
[02:48:09] fine I wanted this world to like second
[02:48:11] wave at enemies but we didn't get it
[02:48:25] Mika looking ass posture
[02:48:28] what does that mean
[02:48:30] the way you're making fun of me for
[02:48:32] having good posture
[02:48:35] doesn't even make sense
[02:48:41] I miss seeing you farm Vermillion shut
[02:48:43] the [ __ ] up
[02:48:44] shut up this is the one dude this is
[02:48:46] like literally the first time we're on
[02:48:48] Vermillion shut up we're not even if we
[02:48:51] do end up going back it can't be this
[02:48:52] soon stop it get some help
[02:48:59] oh my God
[02:49:02] can I shoot
[02:49:11] [ __ ]
[02:49:13] okay
[02:49:18] [ __ ] I pressed the alt and I saw
[02:49:20] something else
[02:49:24] what it's like
[02:49:26] what's this
[02:49:35] okay yo Amy you're just weirdo look look
[02:49:37] for example let's say I do it 180 right
[02:49:39] let's say the 180 but I click see how it
[02:49:42] didn't go where I or I flick to because
[02:49:43] it's like the Click is like weird okay
[02:49:45] well that time it worked but you know
[02:49:46] what I mean you know what I mean like
[02:49:48] see it went sideways so it's like it's a
[02:49:50] gadget thing I hit that though I hit
[02:49:53] that
[02:50:07] we missed the ruin greater in the
[02:50:09] Vermilion domain true actually
[02:50:12] no [ __ ] that guy but it was better than
[02:50:14] this
[02:50:15] okay what goblet would I want on this
[02:50:17] set
[02:50:20] uh uh uh an email for Xiao but we're not
[02:50:23] gonna get that pyro for Lenny
[02:50:27] and maybe some some future you know who
[02:50:29] knows what uh will the future hold
[02:50:32] okay attack
[02:50:35] but anything that has this will lock
[02:50:37] just because we don't know because I
[02:50:39] assume like half of fontan's gonna want
[02:50:40] a Fontan set like no leaks I'm just
[02:50:42] saying probably
[02:50:44] so we'll just lock anything that looks
[02:50:45] good
[02:50:46] but uh not attack
[02:50:55] I didn't mean to do that
[02:51:06] all right cool
[02:51:10] but if everyone uses E before they get
[02:51:11] five Stacks because you want to eat
[02:51:13] every rotation but you're not doing five
[02:51:14] chart shots every rotation
[02:51:15] although I think your burst gives you
[02:51:17] one stack but you're not you're still
[02:51:18] almost rarely doing four you do between
[02:51:21] two to four sometimes you do four but
[02:51:23] usually you don't and if you don't then
[02:51:24] you want to eat before like you're not
[02:51:26] gonna not eat one rotation to wait till
[02:51:27] five because it's only one stock
[02:51:31] you don't get a bonus for having five
[02:51:33] stocks it's just a little bit more
[02:51:34] damage per stock
[02:51:41] [ __ ]
[02:51:45] okay
[02:51:51] will you hop on HSR later uh I've been
[02:51:54] playing it off stream I don't know when
[02:51:56] I'm gonna stream it next surely soon
[02:52:00] um [ __ ]
[02:52:12] so twin two and four just say three no
[02:52:14] because it's not three
[02:52:16] what do you understand but between two
[02:52:17] and four that doesn't mean three it
[02:52:19] means it could be either two or four or
[02:52:21] three
[02:52:23] this could be good
[02:52:28] because like it's usually three or four
[02:52:30] but if you're like sometimes you quick
[02:52:32] swampy and then you just can do two
[02:52:33] because you don't have time to do three
[02:52:34] and sometimes you can do four
[02:52:43] don't say any comprehension I'm n a why
[02:52:46] are you insulting me
[02:52:48] when I'm the one who's right here
[02:52:53] dude
[02:52:58] Oh I thought I already used that okay
[02:53:00] this is you know what
[02:53:05] hey uh I'm just wondering why when you
[02:53:08] taunt the enemies do you stand next to
[02:53:09] your taunt so you also get hit
[02:53:12] your imaginary shadow that I just made
[02:53:14] up that's a good question I actually
[02:53:16] don't know honestly I wish I did know
[02:53:19] I wish I knew so I could tell you
[02:53:40] foreign
[02:53:44] crit damage attack percent and then flat
[02:53:48] defense okay
[02:53:59] Google would do more damage than Lindy
[02:54:01] here okay
[02:54:03] well go up as a chad
[02:54:06] wait Lenny's actually good though
[02:54:12] I mean this team this is a three-man
[02:54:15] team right now like you're not supposed
[02:54:15] to run the net here I just have the net
[02:54:17] because I want to have her in the team
[02:54:24] okay whatever
[02:54:26] I meant I guess I meant er [ __ ] you okay
[02:54:28] [ __ ] you maybe I just shut up
[02:54:47] someone asked is Lenny strong and then
[02:54:50] is he stronger than xiangling in the
[02:54:52] same sentence why would you ask that I
[02:54:54] could say yes to him being strong
[02:54:56] without saying yes to him being stronger
[02:54:58] than Chang Ling why do you have to ask
[02:55:00] the two in one like that shangling is
[02:55:02] strangling
[02:55:04] oppa
[02:55:07] but he is strong
[02:55:13] and he has a passive similar to nilu's
[02:55:15] but without being as done like as
[02:55:17] restrictive like it still is restrictive
[02:55:19] but it doesn't say like hey if you run a
[02:55:23] character that's not pyro [ __ ] you like
[02:55:25] nilu does she's like hey if you're not
[02:55:27] Hydro or dendro get the [ __ ] away from
[02:55:29] me I don't like you and as much as I
[02:55:31] love nilu that's kind of [ __ ] up
[02:55:41] okay
[02:55:48] oh no we want Chris damage not create
[02:55:50] but we could still lock
[02:55:53] yeah
[02:55:56] yeah well
[02:56:16] well just five seconds clearer we do
[02:56:18] this
[02:56:19] solve the bed again immediately okay e
[02:56:22] so the better get the ultimately
[02:56:29] that hit you just couldn't see it
[02:56:31] [ __ ] it actually missed
[02:56:33] wait one second attack
[02:56:35] okay watch this I shoot this guy right
[02:56:37] then I I Lynette
[02:56:39] she missed

[03:06:07] that was actually a good flick though
[03:06:08] actually it gets like watch this
[03:06:10] foreign
[03:06:19] fun to play in comparison to your other
[03:06:21] dps's ah okay
[03:06:24] listen Lenny is fun to play in
[03:06:26] comparison to other Charters his taunt
[03:06:28] kinda Works he has a skill and a burst
[03:06:30] that don't suck balls
[03:06:32] you know you can play with good supports
[03:06:34] I still enjoy like Xiao and I'll hide
[03:06:37] them more
[03:06:39] because they're more like I don't know I
[03:06:41] like how they play a bit better but
[03:06:43] I do think that the way he I do think
[03:06:46] that like for a bow user is pretty fun
[03:06:49] but you also have to be like if you're
[03:06:51] playing it without a shield you might
[03:06:52] wanna like you might hate yourself which
[03:06:54] is that's something you need to keep in
[03:06:55] mind you want resistance interruption or
[03:06:56] a shield
[03:06:59] um yeah
[03:07:01] I mean I guess Big T's kind of okay I'm
[03:07:03] gonna I'm sorry I'm doing a disservice
[03:07:05] the tan all remains everywhere when I
[03:07:07] say other charge holders I'm talking
[03:07:08] about gone you it's gone you I'm talking
[03:07:10] about I'm talking about gonyo I'm sorry
[03:07:12] Lindy's a lot more fun to play but
[03:07:15] um but you know that doesn't you know
[03:07:18] yeah yeah like you have to know what
[03:07:20] like you're going into like yeah like
[03:07:22] you're still a charge router you want a
[03:07:23] shield but like your skill and bursts
[03:07:25] actually have a lot of like good damage
[03:07:27] yes but
[03:07:32] yo spatula
[03:07:54] don't you slander Madge I don't dislike
[03:07:56] on you I just dislike playing her
[03:07:58] charting
[03:07:59] especially with kazua that is the most
[03:08:01] that is the least fun I have but you can
[03:08:03] play her with like zhangri it's fine
[03:08:05] I think her freeze teams are kind of fun
[03:08:07] but venti's kind of not meta anymore so
[03:08:09] it's like yeah
[03:08:14] and then Gandhi's personality is like oh
[03:08:16] my God I don't fit in I'm a half human
[03:08:18] half adapted the humans reject me the
[03:08:20] only traveler understand only you can
[03:08:23] only you can greet me
[03:08:29] what was I thinking of I'll think of
[03:08:31] sona's voice on from [ __ ] League when
[03:08:33] you pick her
[03:08:34] anyways
[03:08:36] yeah wow I'm so overworked true that's
[03:08:40] gone you
[03:08:44] what I think she's cute I mean yeah
[03:08:46] obviously look at her she is but I'm
[03:08:48] saying like I don't like her like I'm
[03:08:51] not the biggest fan of the personality
[03:08:52] like I'm not like a hater like you know
[03:08:54] but I'm not like the biggest uh gone you
[03:08:57] enjoyer also
[03:09:04] yeah
[03:09:07] Chad do you want to get bed I'll bet you
[03:09:09] if you want says the Jeff dude you can't
[03:09:10] do that you can't mod abuse
[03:09:14] you love Chow okay but Xiao you are not
[03:09:17] comparing shouting on you shut the [ __ ]
[03:09:19] up gany was like oh my God I'm so
[03:09:21] overworked Xiao literally would kill
[03:09:23] himself out of overworking he is just
[03:09:26] literally killing demons his whole clan
[03:09:29] every Yak is like dead all of his
[03:09:31] friends are dead
[03:09:43] they are
[03:09:47] it's literally dude
[03:09:54] stop you can get death threats from who
[03:09:58] from who they can't even kill an enemy
[03:10:01] if they're gone you flower explodes 0.5
[03:10:03] seconds before they swap the causeway
[03:10:05] then they miss the karate swirl then
[03:10:07] they do no damage and they get knocked
[03:10:08] around because they're not running a
[03:10:09] [ __ ] Shield

[03:10:26] you I'm just it's funny
[03:10:31] just cause one guy compared her to Xiao
[03:10:33] that's the only reason
[03:10:38] gonyu is the definition of pretty
[03:10:40] privilege
[03:10:43] event he was eventi was designed like a
[03:10:46] waifu he'd be your favorite archon but I
[03:10:49] guarantee you the second I didn't even
[03:10:50] do the new I I don't know folklore I
[03:10:52] didn't do the new Fontan Quest but I'm
[03:10:53] telling you if there's ever a female
[03:10:55] archon that's like
[03:10:57] yeah yeah I I'm just saying venti
[03:11:00] personality carries
[03:11:14] fish fillet
[03:11:21] is this weapon good for big key I should
[03:11:23] be
[03:11:24] yes
[03:11:26] good stats charge attack bonus and then
[03:11:28] attack percent
[03:11:29] yep yep
[03:11:38] I'll take okay you can okay I'm being as
[03:11:41] objective as I can right now you can
[03:11:42] like on you you can like her play style
[03:11:43] you can like her design
[03:11:45] but you can't defend her personality as
[03:11:48] being likable you just cannot dude it's
[03:11:51] literally like oh my God oh my God I'm
[03:11:53] so overworked oh my god oh help me I
[03:11:57] have no friends it's literally that
[03:11:59] I'm not even kidding
[03:12:05] am I wrong I don't if I'm wrong tell me
[03:12:12] like I don't I'm not even mad at the
[03:12:13] character I'm just saying
[03:12:20] [ __ ]
[03:12:26] you said you just said that secretive
[03:12:27] excuse to use your own voice what does
[03:12:29] that mean
[03:12:30] this
[03:12:33] that's not gonna change my opinion on
[03:12:35] her like Meadow eyes or how I review a
[03:12:38] character or anything that doesn't
[03:12:39] matter I'm just saying like
[03:12:41] like personality that's it that's all
[03:12:44] I'm saying
[03:13:17] then you can call yourself
[03:13:23] hey what's up dude I shangling video
[03:13:27] dropped in January and I was too afraid
[03:13:30] I was I literally called her I called
[03:13:32] her broken
[03:13:34] January like 2021
[03:13:48] foreign
[03:14:02] is also the same listen you are
[03:14:04] disrespecting my wife however I actually
[03:14:07] I I can't comment about kokomi because I
[03:14:10] I've heard from drethude and other
[03:14:12] friends that they did her dirty in her
[03:14:14] story Quest so I haven't done her story
[03:14:16] Quest so I cannot comment I am not
[03:14:19] informed enough to comment because I
[03:14:20] have been heard that they did her dirty
[03:14:22] so I would like to just appreciate
[03:14:24] kokomi's design I like kokomis design a
[03:14:26] lot and she's a fish
[03:14:37] look at her
[03:14:42] they nerfed her personality so hard Saj
[03:14:48] okay but look at her
[03:14:59] is two 20 ER too much for casla okay we
[03:15:02] have zajaf in the chat
[03:15:04] nice to find your burner account Dodge
[03:15:12] ball
[03:15:17] you usually want like
[03:15:20] 160 to 180 but some things might want
[03:15:22] that much like a lot of teams need more
[03:15:24] depends if you need that much yards go
[03:15:25] favonius go favonia sword and then maybe
[03:15:28] a few ER Subs like if you need that much
[03:15:30] ER it's probably not worth just [ __ ]
[03:15:33] throwing a much ER on him versus going
[03:15:34] into our weapon
[03:15:43] wait how'd that not hit her
[03:15:53] On Em console with stuff that you care
[03:15:54] about other than ER yeah I mean that's
[03:15:55] fair like on your em Sans circuit and
[03:15:59] goblet you can like stack ER so you
[03:16:01] might have a lot but if you have
[03:16:03] optimized artifacts like if your
[03:16:05] artifacts are that good then you can go
[03:16:07] for an em weapon like
[03:16:09] you usually want fat like five in stock
[03:16:11] are good
[03:16:13] yeah criterate with five is good but
[03:16:15] like if you have like insane ER Subs
[03:16:17] then like you don't need the ER weapon
[03:16:19] anymore
[03:16:30] thank you
[03:16:33] you said for Xiao uh kinda but it's not
[03:16:36] it's usually it's not gonna be better
[03:16:39] than Vermillion for me so I'm just doing
[03:16:40] this for other characters
[03:16:42] but you can't use it for shout which is
[03:16:44] a very very Foggers another shell set
[03:16:59] oh
[03:17:03] I just slandered a character for no
[03:17:05] reason time to like let's do the
[03:17:07] opposite let's praise the character's
[03:17:08] design maybe okay HBO can be good flower
[03:17:12] could be good crit damage em
[03:17:14] criterate circuit okay those were
[03:17:15] locking
[03:17:22] if Ito was buff I would love him even
[03:17:24] more like if those model was how I we
[03:17:27] thought it would be
[03:17:30] Bennett Bennett if Bennett didn't Shop
[03:17:32] at Gap Kids he'd be the best character
[03:17:33] like okay he is the best character I
[03:17:35] love Bennett but like if Bennett
[03:17:37] actually had more drip like if he if we
[03:17:39] could dude friendship Quest you can take
[03:17:42] him shopping you go get him some drip
[03:17:44] instead of uh Gap Kids
[03:17:46] level up I still love Bennett I like how
[03:17:49] he's goofy I like how he looks like he's
[03:17:52] like the best character in a game like
[03:17:54] in a gotcha game where you assume it's
[03:17:55] like the bigger her personality the
[03:17:57] better the character like some other
[03:17:58] gotcha games not the name any names
[03:18:00] Bennett being the best since 1.0 it was
[03:18:02] like Bennett venti Singh Cho in 1.0
[03:18:04] that's you know impressive but he does
[03:18:06] draw that Gap Kids no disrespect it
[03:18:08] suits his design I'm just saying I wish
[03:18:10] I could get him some drip that's all
[03:18:15] but I love Bennett I think Ben is great
[03:18:21] you don't have
[03:18:23] mine either
[03:18:24] wait Fang are you saying I don't have
[03:18:27] drip I am wearing your sweat you made
[03:18:29] this sweater you made this how do I not
[03:18:35] sorry
[03:18:39] it is amazing and I really like it thank
[03:18:41] you
[03:18:44] I made you okay
[03:18:46] that is just not that is just uh
[03:18:48] objectively untrue
[03:18:52] if anything's the Jeff made me true Real
[03:18:55] and True
[03:19:09] okay first Chris damage one no good
[03:19:10] stops that well ER can be good but
[03:19:12] yeah I mean yeah no crude right no
[03:19:14] attack but it could be good
[03:19:18] well Khan is your Lenny C zero
[03:19:27] it has a mustache yeah dude this [ __ ]
[03:19:30] this new set is so cool uh look where is
[03:19:34] it
[03:19:34] I'll just scroll down
[03:19:37] yeah look it's actually still sick
[03:19:38] there's a monocle and a mustache it's
[03:19:41] literally the Wii emote but with a
[03:19:43] monocle and then there's a like a
[03:19:44] drinking flask
[03:19:46] and then a pocket watch and then a comb
[03:19:49] I think this set looks really cool
[03:19:52] like it's very unique
[03:19:58] damage both for Lenny no when I do get a
[03:20:01] new set uh I might if I have enough crit
[03:20:05] like if my sub stats are good enough
[03:20:06] I'll keep going harp but if I have too
[03:20:09] much crit I'll probably craft like
[03:20:10] prototype Crescent or something
[03:20:12] because I don't have a crit damage
[03:20:13] though
[03:20:15] hopefully I can still use harp though
[03:20:17] because heart does give you good damage
[03:20:19] it's just if the
[03:20:21] colors
[03:20:31] wanna roll weapon both are crit damage
[03:20:33] yes and if you have a pair of Primo gems
[03:20:35] you can
[03:20:36] but I don't like pulling on that many
[03:20:38] weapon matters and I want to pull I for
[03:20:41] sure I'm gonna main one of like I really
[03:20:43] like the some of the new contact
[03:20:44] characters okay I really like naviette
[03:20:46] and I like Risley so I'm probably gonna
[03:20:47] pull on one of their weapon banners so
[03:20:50] like I'd rather save my gems for the
[03:20:51] future characters
[03:20:54] because I don't I try not to I'm trying
[03:20:56] not to pull on every weapon matter like
[03:20:57] I pull on like if the ones of the
[03:20:59] characters I like a lot
[03:21:01] or if the weapon's insane
[03:21:08] or if I'm doing like a challenge like I
[03:21:10] got two of Yai's weapon not because I
[03:21:13] wanted it because I was doing like
[03:21:14] every time
[03:21:16] I don't even remember I think every time
[03:21:18] I died in the abyss I pulled through
[03:21:19] some [ __ ] and I died a lot or maybe it
[03:21:21] was like I don't even remember but
[03:21:22] whatever video that is will be out soon
[03:21:24] um
[03:21:29] dude what does that mean
[03:21:32] every time Fang died Fang would never
[03:21:35] die
[03:21:51] it's show time I like how he says it's
[03:21:53] showtime even in Japanese
[03:21:55] wait what does he say in English I don't
[03:21:57] even know C6 yeah High time yeah no
[03:22:02] you still play Val uh I'm like a four
[03:22:04] fun gamer now
[03:22:06] like I play with my friends
[03:22:16] [ __ ] you cat oh it's floating oh never
[03:22:19] mind
[03:22:29] no I didn't
[03:22:40] we're good I mean we can actually hear
[03:22:42] what he says in English I don't actually
[03:22:44] know
[03:22:46] foreign
[03:22:51] disappear
[03:22:52] wait a second
[03:22:55] wait a second
[03:22:57] someone else has disappeared
[03:23:06] wait a second
[03:23:10] all roads lead back the Shao true
[03:23:14] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[03:23:21] so then he criterate damage like 80
[03:23:24] something 200 like 40.
[03:23:27] but we're not on the bad side we don't
[03:23:28] think I'd say it so it doesn't matter
[03:23:34] you think we can get disappear a shower
[03:23:36] let's see let's try to get a double
[03:23:37] disappear

[03:23:46] same time

[03:23:51] second one there that doesn't make sense
[03:23:54] okay let's see if we can get disappeared
[03:23:56] let's see
[03:23:57] step right up disappear oh but wait our

[03:24:46] I felt like being a cat I'm sorry
[03:24:49] I don't know why I did that I just want
[03:24:50] to be a cat
[03:25:07] yeah
[03:25:08] cheers
[03:25:11] worthless cheer
[03:25:14] did our the knees actually cracked
[03:25:17] thumb Lenny popped off

[03:25:39] why are you running double DPS because
[03:25:41] Xiao says disappeared and so does Lenny
[03:25:43] listen and voila no never mind

[03:25:53] look at that
[03:25:55] whoa whoa what was that whoa

[03:26:26] it does
[03:26:28] what
[03:26:30] she dashed forward I couldn't hit that
[03:26:34] why do you check four star sub stats do
[03:26:36] you use them
[03:26:38] um
[03:26:39] I actually don't know
[03:26:41] I think it's just to see like it's just
[03:26:43] to see like like look like let's say you
[03:26:45] look at this she's like oh that could
[03:26:46] have been a five star I don't actually
[03:26:47] know why I checked them I don't actually
[03:26:48] know
[03:26:49] um I don't know I think the the main
[03:26:52] reason I checked them is for example in
[03:26:53] Vermilion okay so in Vermillion now you
[03:26:56] can strong box it so most trial Mains
[03:26:58] that play Xiao and that one for million
[03:26:59] are gonna strongbox it why would you do
[03:27:01] the domain but if you strongbox it
[03:27:04] something you can't get is all of these
[03:27:06] beautiful four stars that I have because
[03:27:08] I put my Blood Sweat and Tears in it
[03:27:12] because I have these amazing four stars
[03:27:15] that you can't get from the strong box
[03:27:17] true

[03:27:43] damage or something but
[03:27:54] a round of applause
[03:27:56] that's a lot of burst
[03:28:04] Mr socks is not more of a self report

[03:34:06] like
[03:34:08] you can't name your kid like a slur like
[03:34:10] it'll get like you can't there's like
[03:34:12] fines or like it'll CH like they won't
[03:34:14] let you
[03:34:17] know like it can be illegal yeah
[03:34:20] and voila I can't wait you can what does
[03:34:24] that mean
[03:34:25] I do think the future of advertising
[03:34:27] though is paying people to to change
[03:34:30] their name like I usually change their
[03:34:32] name or like name some like their kid
[03:34:34] right like I'll name my kid like Honda
[03:34:35] Toyota then you give me like I don't
[03:34:37] know it has to be a lot of money though
[03:34:38] but like I'm just saying that's the
[03:34:40] future of advertising I don't want to do
[03:34:42] it I wouldn't I'm just saying I think
[03:34:44] that's the future
[03:35:07] there's trap music wait what is even the
[03:35:09] music's too low I can't even hear it
[03:35:10] what's even playing
[03:35:12] J Cole is playing
[03:35:15] what the [ __ ] wrong with it
[03:35:20] can this guy die
[03:35:25] when he is dying no he's not when he's
[03:35:27] chilling look look at him
[03:35:33] and voila
[03:35:35] here comes the finale
[03:35:40] hmm
[03:35:43] quick oh I wanted to do it again I don't
[03:35:46] think that would kill me I was like I'll
[03:35:47] just dodge it for like because it's cool
[03:35:49] like you know for comedic effect it just
[03:35:50] killed me okay well
[03:35:53] what if we claim inside of Lynette's

[03:36:10] unrightfully talked about ganyu's
[03:36:13] Persona okay we need to we need to talk
[03:36:15] about a character that we can compliment
[03:36:16] who's a character who I like their
[03:36:18] personality let's see
[03:36:21] I like the heaters now I think Nikita is

[03:36:51] being a menace on purpose is a good
[03:36:53] quality to have I like hutau I think
[03:36:56] it's funny however hutao definitely will
[03:36:59] would put up like Signs next to baiju's
[03:37:01] Hospital of her funeral like parlor
[03:37:04] which is kind of [ __ ] up advertising

[03:40:37] talking about
[03:40:40] there's a birthday video I made for you
[03:40:42] what the [ __ ]
[03:40:44] um
[03:40:46] you could put it in the server but I
[03:40:49] wouldn't see it till a bit later
[03:40:54] but I will watch it
[03:40:56] I'm still behind on
[03:40:57] ES
[03:40:58] I need to get better at responding dude
[03:41:00] I am so bad it's it's to the point where
[03:41:02] like people think I don't like them
[03:41:04] because I don't respond like I dude I
[03:41:06] just can't like I'm trying okay I'm
[03:41:09] actually doing better but it's so dude
[03:41:12] listen
[03:41:14] I feel like I it's hard okay it's hard
[03:41:20] shocked you responded to me of course
[03:41:22] big F
[03:41:25] your unpaid labor is appreciated
[03:41:28] oh no and I have to include that clip
[03:41:30] this could be really good disclaimer
[03:41:32] listen it
[03:41:34] my model wants to be here it's
[03:41:43] Hunter's brooch this could be really
[03:41:44] good I don't know why I popped off I
[03:41:46] feel like I was I'm like I got really
[03:41:48] hyped but this piece is probably just
[03:41:49] Gonna Roll flat attack but it could be
[03:41:50] really good so we're gonna keep it
[03:41:57] as long as you do build reviews every uh
[03:41:59] so like about a week or so ago we did a
[03:42:01] uid review sometimes on my stream I'll
[03:42:03] do that randomly and I'll post about in
[03:42:05] Discord
[03:42:06] other times I do account reviews
[03:42:08] and then uh I think we're gonna do
[03:42:09] another uad review probably within like
[03:42:11] two weeks let's say two to three
[03:42:14] um and we're gonna do two account
[03:42:15] reviews I but I'm thinking for the
[03:42:17] account reviews I might want to wait I
[03:42:19] might do one soon
[03:42:21] uh I might revisit Julie's account but
[03:42:25] I want to wait till there's the new uh
[03:42:27] fontannabis I don't know what it's gonna
[03:42:28] be but I know there's gonna be one so it
[03:42:30] might be smart to do one then when the
[03:42:32] advice is a bit more relevant so
[03:42:35] I think within a week or two weeks or
[03:42:37] three weeks we'll open forums for cursed
[03:42:39] accounts and for whale accounts
[03:42:42] curse accounts are like scoffs what the
[03:42:44] [ __ ] should I do and then whale accounts
[03:42:45] where it's like
[03:42:46] yeah and then we'll do both so that'll
[03:42:49] be in the Discord essential District
[03:42:52] you choose it random okay uid reviews or
[03:42:54] just take randomly from chat the account
[03:42:56] reviews we put a form so that I could
[03:42:58] see like what your account looks like
[03:42:59] and then whichever ones are like the
[03:43:00] best content or the most potential or
[03:43:02] the least potential depending on the
[03:43:04] video
[03:43:05] well not least but that that sounds
[03:43:06] toxic but you know what I mean
[03:43:09] now disappear
[03:43:14] can someone fashion impact dude the
[03:43:16] [ __ ] new set is fashion dude dude the

[03:47:36] saying like if you run and jump and you
[03:47:38] keep jumping even if you're out of
[03:47:40] stamina you can preserve the momentum
[03:47:41] and I feel like that was something that
[03:47:43] like I knew and I would do but it's like
[03:47:45] I didn't know if it was like Bro Science
[03:47:47] like I didn't know if it was an actual
[03:47:48] thing and I was like wait a second this

[03:47:53] true but how do you
[03:47:56] why can't I do it right now whatever
[03:48:00] and it's like even if you run out of
[03:48:01] stab it out preserves it
[03:48:04] Lynette can't do it right really
[03:48:08] is it character specific
[03:48:12] because I do it all the time with like

[03:56:54] please tell me what [ __ ] name the
[03:56:56] character is gonna be on my party screen
[03:56:57] I hate when every new character has 86
[03:57:00] names I don't care dude child is not
[03:57:03] child Ryden was not [ __ ] any of her
[03:57:06] two other names and [ __ ] scarra is
[03:57:08] Among Us
[03:57:10] Farina okay
[03:57:12] good to know noted
[03:57:24] well Galore is the demon name I see
[03:57:27] [ __ ] that all
[03:57:36] right here worthless Brian has four
[03:57:40] names yeah
[03:57:42] well actually one of them is the puppet
[03:57:44] so you're wrong
[03:57:46] true
[03:57:51] can you say Farina in French it's not a
[03:57:53] [ __ ] I mean I don't think that like
[03:57:55] it's not an actual name is it
[03:57:59] Farina also spelled Farina was an
[03:58:01] ancient Roman goddess whose function had
[03:58:03] become obscure by the first century BC
[03:58:04] her cult dated to the earliest period of
[03:58:07] Roman religious history okay well
[03:58:08] there's a cult
[03:58:11] means flower in French okay yeah but
[03:58:14] sure if anything be like firina but that
[03:58:18] doesn't sound like [ __ ] Farin
[03:58:20] but I do think that sounds better
[03:58:23] flower
[03:58:31] Farina is a god of water oh that would
[03:58:33] make sense
[03:58:37] foreign
[03:59:10] okay Chad I have a dilemma right now
[03:59:12] wait first of all
[03:59:14] okay one more no no I wouldn't do it I
[03:59:16] didn't I literally didn't I literally
[03:59:18] didn't I literally didn't
[03:59:19] okay we're just gonna condense the
[03:59:22] it was the 50 Primo gem one dude it's
[03:59:24] not even bad to do the 51 that wasn't
[03:59:26] even like a whale one it was 50.
[03:59:28] okay anyways
[03:59:31] um okay
[03:59:34] should we keep going before I level or
[03:59:36] should I level now I'm gonna keep going
[03:59:38] a bit maybe until we fill up our
[03:59:39] artifact inventory but
[03:59:44] I can always also like
[03:59:46] because I have to level [ __ ] today and
[03:59:48] I'll probably like
[03:59:50] I'll probably keep going to those fold
[03:59:51] and level things then do the rest
[03:59:53] tomorrow maybe
[03:59:55] I'm gonna keep going tonight it's just I
[03:59:57] don't wanna like
[03:59:58] yeah we'll see
[04:00:09] sounds good to me
[04:00:13] I know I didn't watch the HSR 1.3 live
[04:00:15] but I know like I saw the like important
[04:00:17] stuff it's pretty cool
[04:00:25] how long do you intend to stream forever

[04:00:36] I'll definitely be playing Star rail for
[04:00:38] the next match so
[04:00:39] I do want to try to stream style more
[04:00:41] this is hard because like I'm so there's
[04:00:42] so much against [ __ ] I need to do that I
[04:00:43] can't even make time so we'll see sure
[04:00:45] we'll see

[04:04:21] your therapist tell you how to how to

[04:04:30] build Lenny
[04:04:50] foreign
[04:04:59] my therapist can help me build a life
[04:05:01] okay true true but I can help you build

[04:05:13] out that I'm just putting that out there
[04:05:14] I mean probably your life but I'm just
[04:05:16] saying I'm still no variety streams

[04:05:29] good stream
[04:05:44] ers

[04:05:58] haven't streamed because I played
[04:05:59] upstairs like my dad and my brother but
[04:06:02] I think if we do righty the most likely
[04:06:04] is gonna be Elder ring Valerian and
[04:06:09] probably some dumbass random game that's
[04:06:13] like
[04:06:14] like with other people
[04:06:19] oh I also bought Persona 5. I just
[04:06:20] haven't played it

[04:06:35] Fang I play Danganronpa off stream I am
[04:06:39] not streaming that game
[04:06:44] that game I feel like having a chat
[04:06:47] would ruin that game
[04:06:51] like it's good but everyone dies so I
[04:06:54] literally chat would just be the worst
[04:06:55] oh clueless oh he likes this character
[04:06:58] Clueless

[04:18:27] appreciate you Karen the Karen
[04:18:31] oh foreign
[04:18:35] but like favonis is usually better
[04:18:37] because you'd rather have a weapon that
[04:18:38] gives your team energy
[04:18:39] uh but if you just want an HP weapon
[04:18:41] then sure
[04:18:48] now disappear

[04:19:10] choir I'd be like you know there's like
[04:19:12] a choir for Fontana like

[04:19:21] it I think I could do it I'm just being
[04:19:22] honest this could be good
[04:19:32] what are good four-star options for your
[04:19:34] lawn fevonius bonus is great for her
[04:19:42] and you're going for free by doing some
[04:19:44] random ass Quest
[04:19:46] I like some archon quests or some [ __ ]
[04:19:48] at the start
[04:19:59] well I gotta charge off
[04:20:17] someone asked if this is zero damage and
[04:20:20] then someone replied to Clueless
[04:20:22] does that mean I'm not c0 my Lydia is
[04:20:25] literally see Zero how is this Clueless
[04:20:29] I'm not even on a signature set
[04:20:36] okay this is good I said when our
[04:20:38] avatory I said when our inventory was
[04:20:40] full we would level artifacts so now we
[04:20:42] can do the first wave of leveling
[04:20:44] artifacts and that's content
[04:20:47] so it's fine
[04:20:54] it might be time chat
[04:20:58] gold we have 186 golden troop 181
[04:21:02] marriage
[04:21:06] also yeah the Buff's artifact inventory
[04:21:08] space it's 1800 now it used to be it was
[04:21:10] 1500 then 1800.
[04:21:19] which one should we start with we can
[04:21:20] start with Massachusetts yeah we'll
[04:21:22] start now we'll start with the golden
[04:21:23] Troop
[04:21:34] why not just make it 2K
[04:21:36] what do you mean
[04:21:40] oh like the inventory space yeah
[04:21:54] all right let's check the artifacts so
[04:21:55] for the circlets we have a crude raid
[04:21:57] one we locked maybe like socks why did
[04:21:59] you lock this well if it gets crit
[04:22:00] damage it's still pretty good ER and 83
[04:22:02] maybe or defense you know who knows who
[04:22:04] knows who knows but you know with a
[04:22:06] circuit you can't be that picky and with
[04:22:08] a new set you also can't be that picky
[04:22:10] so as you guys can see never mind but
[04:22:12] you know potential
[04:22:14] uh let's keep rolling until we get
[04:22:16] something good this one could record
[04:22:18] right
[04:22:28] okay defense
[04:22:32] uh another circuit with crit rate this
[04:22:35] one has no good substance but crit
[04:22:36] damage could still be decent uh to save
[04:22:39] the artifact
[04:22:48] okay
[04:22:53] imagine if before I started rolling
[04:22:54] artifacts I was like I'll cut back like
[04:22:57] I'll see you guys when I roll something
[04:22:59] good and then the video ends
[04:23:04] this could be good maybe
[04:23:08] um
[04:23:14] should I roll this circuit does anyone
[04:23:15] care about an attack circlet
[04:23:24] no
[04:23:27] okay we'll do goblets next we'll start
[04:23:28] with we'll go flowers now okay this one
[04:23:30] get a good rate Critter would make us a
[04:23:31] very very good flower for Fishel because
[04:23:34] em is also great for aggravate uh and I
[04:23:36] really want a good official set that's
[04:23:38] one of my main goals
[04:23:40] ah it's okay I guess but yeah

[04:26:30] use that still good still good still
[04:26:32] good crit
[04:26:41] A wise man once told me don't celebrate
[04:26:43] too early A wise man once said
[04:26:47] sometimes in life
[04:26:54] it is best
[04:26:56] to believe even when the odds are Slim
[04:27:01] A wise man once said
[04:27:04] nothing at all
[04:27:08] I mean
[04:27:10] bad it's it's weird like I want crit but
[04:27:13] yeah it's good it's still good aggravate
[04:27:15] Fishel aggravate yay
[04:27:18] crystallize Albedo it's maybe not that
[04:27:22] one it's actually good
[04:27:24] um we just want one more critical one
[04:27:25] more crit roll that it's actually a
[04:27:26] solid piece
[04:27:27] I'm not coping it's literally good if it
[04:27:30] gets another control let's see please
[04:27:32] dude this would be so juicy
[04:27:36] like the worst part is that I had three
[04:27:38] sub stats that's it
[04:27:50] first time chatter dweeb game
[04:27:53] true
[04:28:00] what a chad
[04:28:12] okay crude Raider who's that [ __ ] and I
[04:28:14] won't complain ever that's not true
[04:28:17] but I'll be happy you'll be happy I'm
[04:28:19] telling you I'll be happy I'll be happy
[04:28:20] I'm being genuine
[04:28:26] it's good it's still good it's still
[04:28:30] good it's still good unironically good
[04:28:34] on Fishel or yai it's fine Em's not as
[04:28:37] good as crit but it's still good
[04:28:40] it's still good
[04:28:43] as far as I as far as no not far is that
[04:28:45] a cosmo peace
[04:28:47] with that luck okay
[04:28:49] it's actually not bad it's actually not
[04:28:51] bad oh [ __ ] it's bad so Jeff just said
[04:28:53] I'd use that in chat oh that means
[04:28:55] that's bad I was thinking it's pretty
[04:28:57] good for like yeah because she can use
[04:28:58] all the sub stats same with official but
[04:29:00] oh [ __ ] okay we just gotta confirm that
[04:29:03] it sucks
[04:29:04] I think it's pretty decent though it's
[04:29:06] pretty decent it's pretty decent we just
[04:29:07] unlucky on the emeralds but whatever
[04:29:10] that's fine honestly fine like good
[04:29:12] start
[04:29:19] still beautiful
[04:29:21] let's draw this one
[04:29:31] can I get one uh Lego is done we just
[04:29:33] have to delay it for a bit I'm sorry but
[04:29:34] it should be out off the Stream
[04:29:38] paw strap for damage okay
[04:29:41] because it'll be good I guess
[04:29:43] um yeah I guess I'll be good
[04:29:48] okay no I can't
[04:29:52] oh this one has attack em and crit rate
[04:29:54] so even though there's no crude damage
[04:29:56] again these stats are useful so it's
[04:29:58] usable just got here either DPS farming
[04:30:01] going well dude yes so this new set is
[04:30:04] actually gonna be like that actually
[04:30:05] could be content I'm down
[04:30:07] whoo
[04:30:09] wait maybe the artifact gods are pleased
[04:30:11] with the global DPS idea okay if if this
[04:30:14] piece only rolls great I'll make a woman
[04:30:16] DPS video I promise
[04:30:19] okay that if it still keeps going good
[04:30:22] right I will
[04:30:24] you're allowed to miss one I mean
[04:30:25] attack's not even bad Google likes
[04:30:27] attack
[04:30:34] okay well
[04:30:59] hey
[04:31:06] Yahoo
[04:31:10] this could be good it could roll cut
[04:31:11] right
[04:31:15] well I had 10 million more what happened
[04:31:18] it's fine
[04:31:19] okay did it
[04:31:21] okay maybe we'll raise our standards a
[04:31:23] little
[04:31:25] uh let's look at Sans this could be good
[04:31:27] hey hey if this gets criterate actually
[04:31:30] a good sense double crit on an attack
[04:31:32] Sans is very valuable in this current
[04:31:34] economy
[04:31:40] what about this one
[04:31:42] on who I don't know someone
[04:32:00] I definitely want I wanted em sounds on
[04:32:02] the set official in the eye I really
[04:32:03] like yam sounds
[04:32:05] like attacking Yama are pretty much as
[04:32:07] about as good as one another with
[04:32:09] official but the m is like I don't know
[04:32:14] um it gets to be good
[04:32:17] it's a new artifacts that I can't have
[04:32:19] the high standards
[04:32:25] so replace these songs yeah it's the
[04:32:27] Hoya mix uh Footprints of the traveler
[04:32:30] Volume 2 playlist
[04:32:32] it's on Spotify
[04:32:35] all right well
[04:32:43] I think we just don't have a good sound
[04:32:44] Zone
[04:32:45] I mean this could be good I just don't
[04:32:46] know for who
[04:32:51] from Eco attacks better even though if
[04:32:52] you have cons uh not true like
[04:32:55] attack is better if you're not
[04:32:56] aggravating but if you're aggravating
[04:32:57] you're on field
[04:32:58] BM could be better because you also get
[04:33:00] like for aggravate in general it's about
[04:33:02] as good and then yai also has a passive
[04:33:04] that can give you some
[04:33:07] so it depends on how much you aggravate
[04:33:08] or if you hyper Bluetooth because the
[04:33:10] eye can also get like conceal some
[04:33:12] so they're kind of about as good though
[04:33:14] usually
[04:33:19] Geo
[04:33:21] is this dory's theme
[04:33:59] all right we have a Geo goblet I don't
[04:34:00] know if this could be well Albedo
[04:34:02] actually could use this yeah so we could
[04:34:03] maybe use this on Albedo so if it's good
[04:34:05] we're happy it does have to be like
[04:34:07] amazing but you know pretty good defense
[04:34:09] percent or crit rate or okay fat defense
[04:34:20] all right well it's dead
[04:34:27] all right last piece of golden true
[04:34:29] before we go to the other set we have a
[04:34:31] pyro goblet double crit ER very happy
[04:34:33] with this this could be good on on on on
[04:34:35] on on so much no I can't but if you
[04:34:37] could offset maybe for a future
[04:34:39] character or for like globa a guava DPS
[04:34:42] build think about it above guoba
[04:34:45] everything's dead mad
[04:34:51] okay it's fine
[04:34:58] that doesn't affect guoba but it's fine
[04:35:05] I don't know it
[04:35:25] um
[04:35:27] the araken is back let's go chat
[04:35:31] can we use this
[04:35:34] surely this is good on someone right
[04:35:38] also guys in three months
[04:35:40] yeah maybe the Pyro archives uh
[04:35:50] it's fine because we have the
[04:35:53] Massachusetts set we saved the best one
[04:35:55] for last and I'm sure we have a lot of
[04:35:57] good things here
[04:35:58] for example look at our crit damage
[04:36:00] circuit you want crit damage on the set
[04:36:02] so basically no matter what this should
[04:36:04] be good watch
[04:36:13] um
[04:36:15] well
[04:36:20] it's not even bad stats it's just not
[04:36:22] good for Lenny but other characters can
[04:36:24] use it
[04:36:31] I'll keep it I guess
[04:36:35] here comes the catcho part two

[04:44:59] if it gets crit damage two more times it
[04:45:01] could be 28 crude damage which is
[04:45:04] actually not bad if this had 20 acre

[04:56:14] gambler's feather I'm sorry
[04:56:20] well
[04:56:26] okay
[04:56:28] so
[04:56:30] we just rolled and got not the best but
[04:56:34] I think
[04:56:35] we can still keep going because we have
[04:56:37] 44 more fragile and we only spent like
[04:56:39] two or three k of our resin so we're
[04:56:42] gonna go spend all of this 44 fragile or
[04:56:44] at least like 40 of it
[04:56:46] we'll go spend more resin and then come
[04:56:48] back with an update number two
[04:57:04] but that'll probably be done in another
[04:57:06] day
[04:57:07] because I've been swimming for five
[04:57:08] hours my throat hurts I'm not gonna end
[04:57:10] right now but I'm just saying well
[04:57:11] probably next stream we'll spend the
[04:57:12] rest of it do more and then it'll be a
[04:57:14] two stream thing boom and then after
[04:57:16] that uh I might go to the gentian Fontan
[04:57:20] tour thing in New York then I'll come
[04:57:22] back and then I'll do the mainstream no
[04:57:24] sorry the archon quest stream in a made
[04:57:25] outfit POG and then account reviews and
[04:57:28] then that's content okay so now what I
[04:57:30] need to do
[04:57:34] well that was part one done
[04:57:36] uh but I'm gonna have to do more
[04:57:37] tomorrow because uh yeah so I'll
[04:57:39] probably stream again tomorrow
[04:57:47] but dude Argos is so long we have to do
[04:57:49] it at a time where there's like no one
[04:57:51] around
[04:57:52] I don't even know if I don't even know

[05:01:57] no
[05:01:59] Hydro tree looks kind of cryo no this
[05:02:01] Hydro what do you think what do you
[05:02:03] think water does when it's cold it turns
[05:02:05] to ice
[05:02:06] so would you say ice isn't water no it
[05:02:09] is it's just a different [ __ ] State

[05:02:16] wait let's go check up on our friend
[05:02:22] let's go check up on our friend
[05:02:24] where is he
[05:02:25] where's our friend
[05:02:32] where is Berry Puff
[05:02:44] wait
[05:02:46] Barry buff has another friend
[05:02:53] wait that is very wholesome
[05:02:56] hey Berry Puff
[05:02:58] oh it's singing he looks like you're
[05:03:01] really happy
[05:03:03] that is so wholesome
[05:03:09] I'll be back soon Berry Puff
[05:03:25] how'd you get it you just go here and
[05:03:26] you talk to him and you feed him fish
[05:03:27] make sure you have fish
[05:03:37] okay
[05:03:43] dude what the [ __ ] is down here oh it's
[05:03:46] just blue
[05:03:55] probably still valid for Fontana no if
[05:03:58] you put drawings in your party in font
[05:03:59] 10 you die
[05:04:03] yeah I mean
[05:04:09] I was only got the sickest garter belt
[05:04:11] in this game the [ __ ] is a garter belt
[05:04:13] is that even a word
[05:04:21] garter
[05:04:30] the thing on your leg
[05:04:32] oh those things
[05:04:35] oh
[05:04:36] true actually
[05:04:43] Google it I'm good
[05:04:51] wait how is there a pyro torch
[05:04:53] underwater
[05:04:59] the [ __ ]
[05:05:04] bro hasn't done any quests
[05:05:08] oh I assume this place is
[05:05:12] this place looks like I'm gonna be able
[05:05:14] to walk around in it
[05:05:16] because there's like a staircase and
[05:05:17] [ __ ] so I assume this place is no longer
[05:05:19] going to be underwater that makes sense
[05:05:22] [ __ ] Atlantis
[05:05:29] I'm gonna do
[05:05:31] no
[05:05:34] feet gonna
[05:05:38] help Pizza shoe man [ __ ] pity shoe
[05:05:48] seal
[05:05:50] at least they're not aggressive
[05:05:55] dude they're literally singing
[05:06:00] this is in-game music it's get your
[05:06:02] music but it's not Funtime music this is
[05:06:03] like sumero music I just have their
[05:06:05] playlist playing
[05:06:13] are the banners this version worth yes
[05:06:15] but if you want to save your Primos then
[05:06:17] for the next characters then that makes
[05:06:18] sense too but Yolanda is pretty cracked
[05:06:20] and uh Lenny's a good DPS if you want
[05:06:22] them
[05:06:23] but we have a lot of new characters
[05:06:24] coming out of Fountain so saving Primos
[05:06:27] is not a bad option
[05:06:31] how'd you get the water pet next to
[05:06:32] Bennett oh this actually does look like
[05:06:34] a [ __ ] Fontan pit uh this was like a
[05:06:37] year ago what the [ __ ] is this even from
[05:06:39] some of that
[05:06:43] yeah it's for beating the okay if you
[05:06:45] collect every font oh is this
[05:06:46] anniversary one whatever if you get
[05:06:48] every font 10 uh if you get every Fontan
[05:06:51] uh hydroculus and do every Quest and 100
[05:06:54] every part you get it so that's why I
[05:06:56] have it because I just explore all the
[05:06:58] time so yeah
[05:07:01] they don't call me the master explorator
[05:07:03] for nothing so yeah
[05:07:20] [ __ ] 20 minutes
[05:07:24] first time chatter is the FTP yeah yeah
[05:07:26] of course of course dude I [ __ ] can't
[05:07:28] relate to those whale streamers that
[05:07:29] like just pull for everyone it's all C6
[05:07:31] unrelatable like I wouldn't do that so
[05:07:32] yeah you're in a safe space here don't
[05:07:34] worry
[05:07:35] yeah
[05:07:36] every five star on my team right now is
[05:07:38] c0 every five star Mighty must be zero

[05:07:57] matter c0 okay C1 dudes causal C1 does
[05:08:00] literally it's literally convenience
[05:08:02] it's qual I got it by accident my cat on
[05:08:05] my keyboard activated it
[05:08:19] and the other five what do you mean I
[05:08:21] only have one constellation the only
[05:08:23] reason I got more Cosmos was I was
[05:08:24] trying to get hazel I got two Cosmos
[05:08:26] before I got one Hazel not my fault then
[05:08:29] uh crazy thing happened where I went to
[05:08:31] the wall through washroom cat runs on my
[05:08:34] keyboard
[05:08:35] somehow does a 10 pull in the temple got
[05:08:38] six causes then my account they thought

[05:09:15] I forgot where it was I forgot where it
[05:09:18] was
[05:09:21] very cool
[05:09:26] can you call me do it too
[05:09:38] no why not
[05:09:41] such
[05:09:47] only Fontana characters yeah but she's
[05:09:49] literally the [ __ ] font the hydro
[05:09:50] archon
[05:09:51] why wouldn't it work explain that oh
[05:09:55] wait this guy's hurting me
[05:10:04] foreign
[05:10:06] wait three Crystal cores
[05:10:11] I mean Crystal flies holy [ __ ]
[05:10:15] well I want these two
[05:10:18] uh I need these r's
[05:10:21] wait there's so many oars
[05:10:27] you can use hydro traveler for what like
[05:10:29] the diving thing yeah yeah I figured it
[05:10:31] was font 10 characters in Hydra MC
[05:10:33] but
[05:10:36] I don't know why I can't use could call
[05:10:37] me sad
[05:10:39] why not every Hydro character
[05:10:48] who's using hydro traveler
[05:10:51] um Hey listen okay just because I
[05:10:55] actually can't even make a code for that
[05:10:57] yeah I don't know maybe with
[05:10:58] constellations like when we get to play
[05:11:00] the constellations it might get better
[05:11:01] but I mean I'll try them I guess I'll
[05:11:03] try them out
[05:11:12] sorry
[05:11:19] and we have an enemies built different
[05:11:26] do I need momentum or can I just jump
[05:11:28] out oh I can just jump out
[05:11:30] I'm gonna get this high this coin thing
[05:11:39] dude I have a question
[05:11:42] why did we get a bigger stamina bar in
[05:11:45] [ __ ] like the 1.0 when you collect
[05:11:47] all the oculuses but then we got
[05:11:49] electroculosis we got Sumer oculuses and
[05:11:53] Fontana oculuses and our stamina bars
[05:11:55] stay the same
[05:11:57] dude c0 who Tom is right now shambles
[05:12:09] oh why did I think I could board this
[05:12:11] boat that was my Wave Rider
[05:12:17] for game balance yeah I mean it makes
[05:12:19] sense
[05:12:20] you don't want infinite like I get it
[05:12:22] but also I'm a infinite stamina enjoyer
[05:12:24] so I don't care give me as much stamina
[05:12:26] as I can get
[05:12:31] uh is there like a thing I can suck sure
[05:12:34] that I can suck uh okay I'm not gonna
[05:12:36] finish that sentence surely I can take
[05:12:38] the power of a creature

[05:13:34] [ __ ]
[05:13:35] wait so is the meta to explore
[05:13:37] underwater you just build a team on full
[05:13:39] HP everything so you don't die
[05:13:42] foreign
[05:13:51] why do people say his height when he
