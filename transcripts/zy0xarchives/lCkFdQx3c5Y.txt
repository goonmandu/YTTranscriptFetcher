[00:24:53] actual lighting dude it's I I didn't
[00:24:55] change my lighting if anything my light
[00:24:57] died I have less lighting my boots not
[00:24:59] even on my back
[00:25:02] there's a light outside because it's the
[00:25:04] daylight
[00:25:16] or you and you and you Mia might never
[00:25:19] leave for six I really hate that
[00:25:21] business oh [ __ ] actual lighting
[00:25:25] this looks weird low-key everything dies
[00:25:31] it looks like it looks too HD
[00:25:33] [Music]
[00:25:42] shut your window no
[00:25:45] wait the light keeps dying
[00:25:48] okay the hotel night lamp is actually
[00:25:49] look at this look at how dead this thing
[00:25:51] is
[00:25:54] [Music]
[00:26:04] now too much Theory crafting where is
[00:26:09] all right ready chat we're about to play
[00:26:12] catching it back it's what we have to do
[00:26:13] oh yeah I was doing my bounties
[00:26:15] I don't know why I took so long to
[00:26:17] launch engine actually I'm not sorry
[00:26:19] [ __ ] you guys
[00:26:20] replace the bulb now it's the charging
[00:26:22] thing you have to charge it but I
[00:26:24] haven't charged it since I first got it
[00:26:33] Shang Ling is so op I can
[00:26:39] vaporize with no ICD
[00:26:51] oh wait I didn't even open the like
[00:26:53] website to like randomized [ __ ] wait let
[00:26:55] me do that
[00:27:06] [Music]
[00:27:10] uh I might do a team recommendation
[00:27:13] thing later once we test more teams but
[00:27:15] for now I can safely say
[00:27:19] shangling second half ortoma virgin but
[00:27:21] usually shangling uh and then first off
[00:27:24] you could do bait I think Beto first
[00:27:25] half is [ __ ] insane I think Beto is
[00:27:27] like one of the strongest leaders right
[00:27:28] now you play Beto first half you're
[00:27:30] chilling or you could do ayaka freeze uh
[00:27:33] you can also just yeah and then second
[00:27:35] half is like either you really want pyro
[00:27:37] so you can you can do virgin pyro and
[00:27:39] then uh like dendro pyro version or you
[00:27:42] could just do regular pyro with like
[00:27:44] shangling and [ __ ]
[00:27:44] [Music]
[00:27:46] but Beto first off is really good
[00:27:48] I might do an account review for this
[00:27:50] Abyss because it's pretty hard so yeah I
[00:27:51] might open those up if you guys are
[00:27:52] interested
[00:27:53] all right roses to 10 months
[00:28:01] [Music]
[00:28:03] virgin against boss question mark it
[00:28:06] doesn't matter
[00:28:07] like the hard part
[00:28:11] okay how do I say this the hard part is
[00:28:12] like 12-1 and [ __ ] right and then
[00:28:15] um 12-3
[00:28:18] like if you're struggling with 12 3 then
[00:28:20] you can change your team
[00:28:21] because the yeah exactly the 12 2 is
[00:28:24] like the Thunder manifestation usually
[00:28:25] isn't that hard as long as you have like
[00:28:27] one or two characters that can hit it
[00:28:28] it's not the hardest part so if you're
[00:28:30] talking about the last part like the the
[00:28:32] whatever his name is The Inquisitor the
[00:28:34] Baptist or the [ __ ] then it should be
[00:28:36] fine but if you can't you can just
[00:28:38] change teams the main hard part for me
[00:28:39] at least has been 12-1 and 12-2 hasn't
[00:28:42] been that hard 12 3 is hard too but it's
[00:28:44] most of the first half
[00:28:46] is
[00:28:51] yeah exactly the free cells and the
[00:28:53] beasts are the hard part so it's like if
[00:28:54] you're struggling with the bosses in the
[00:28:56] second half then you can change your
[00:28:58] team but having either virgin or like
[00:29:00] shangling or whatever for 12 one second
[00:29:02] half will ensure you get three stars on
[00:29:04] twelve one and then if you have that you
[00:29:05] can maybe change your team after if you
[00:29:07] need to but usually you won't need to
[00:29:08] all right where they did an entire
[00:29:10] animated music video for 88 degrees
[00:29:12] Bedrock wait really no that that's that
[00:29:16] has to be copium
[00:29:20] is a dollar
[00:29:23] 88 degrees bedrock
[00:29:30] it's real wait send me it Matt's always
[00:29:34] in two months
[00:29:36] is it okay to not be able to clear the
[00:29:37] abyss at ar58 okay here's the harsh
[00:29:40] reality listen listen here listen and
[00:29:42] listen carefully listen listen
[00:29:44] usually you can clear most of Business
[00:29:46] by just having two good teams that are
[00:29:48] built if that's all you've been doing
[00:29:50] your whole life maybe this is impossible
[00:29:52] for you because you need specific
[00:29:53] elements and specific teams so you can
[00:29:56] still build certain characters you may
[00:29:57] have to clear it like Beto first half
[00:29:59] shangling or virgin second half and
[00:30:01] still get through this annoying Abyss
[00:30:03] pushing it wait let me meet alert a
[00:30:05] second
[00:30:05] still get through this annoying Abyss
[00:30:07] even
[00:30:09] three player whatever
[00:30:10] is characters that are really annoying
[00:30:13] is it worth it no you get literally like
[00:30:15] like less than a single pool for nine
[00:30:17] starring [ __ ] 412 and it takes you
[00:30:20] probably a month of work or more
[00:30:22] depending on where you are in the game
[00:30:23] so it's like not worth it but and it's
[00:30:25] fine if you can't 36 all right but you
[00:30:28] should be able to if you play the
[00:30:29] correct teams and stuff in adventuring
[00:30:31] as in business you always have to but
[00:30:33] you like need a very specific set of
[00:30:35] elements and you need to make sure
[00:30:37] you're not dying so Shield second half
[00:30:38] or dodging everything in spam resetting
[00:30:40] and then for twelve three you need to
[00:30:42] make sure you can kill two consecrated
[00:30:43] beasts two waves of them who's really
[00:30:45] good at killing two characters at a time
[00:30:47] [ __ ] Beto do you have her build do
[00:30:49] not like it depends on who you're
[00:30:50] playing in [ __ ] so like yeah
[00:30:59] five months
[00:31:01] oh one sec chat
[00:31:10] oh wait he just redeemed Deadpool
[00:31:13] I'm gonna donut wall you why because
[00:31:15] we'll get him when we do the abyss and
[00:31:17] then it won't be a scam true
[00:31:23] wait let me play music
[00:31:29] my Beta was crowned but her weapon is
[00:31:31] level 50.
[00:31:35] did you get hacked in the hacker threw
[00:31:37] your Claymore away what the [ __ ]
[00:31:38] happened how do you Crown a claymore
[00:31:40] character
[00:31:41] without having a claymore
[00:31:55] how is not the question why is no but
[00:31:57] it's also a how like if you love Beto
[00:31:59] surely you have a claymore for how do I
[00:32:01] get up there
[00:32:01] wait it's that there's a down arrow is
[00:32:03] it just here oh my God it's just here
[00:32:04] I'm [ __ ] stupid
[00:32:06] there are barely any good Claymores
[00:32:10] I mean sure but like bro if you're
[00:32:12] playing Beto there's a lot of options
[00:32:14] what even though like free play one's
[00:32:16] fine
[00:32:17] but if you buy the battle pass GG gets
[00:32:19] to respond if you don't you can just use
[00:32:20] any of the gotcha ones if you don't have
[00:32:22] a gotcha one crap the [ __ ] Discord
[00:32:24] mod Spirit no wait the Claymore whatever
[00:32:25] it's called the like contain cross
[00:32:27] Claymore I don't know what it's called
[00:32:28] the way you know what I'm talking about
[00:32:35] come on
[00:32:41] Royal weapons are back in the shot oh
[00:32:43] [ __ ]
[00:32:46] wait yo you guys just oh my God I just
[00:32:49] got an idea wait are they if they are
[00:32:51] I'm gonna add it on the wheel you know
[00:32:52] how every time okay we're doing a
[00:32:54] randomizer today and every time we die
[00:32:55] we're gonna wheel I'm gonna put R5 uh uh
[00:32:59] Royal codex or whatever it's called
[00:33:00] royal grimoire
[00:33:02] I'm gonna put R5 Royal grimmar in the
[00:33:04] wheel one sec R5 Royal grimoire
[00:33:18] you own
[00:33:24] yeah I decided that in the wheel I'll
[00:33:26] show you guys the wheel later
[00:33:28] uh wait where'd my streamlabs go hey
[00:33:30] there it is
[00:33:33] so we have your account reviews for Star
[00:33:34] Oil yes if the game is still relevant
[00:33:36] right now I'm just like playing it on
[00:33:38] the side just seeing how it goes but if
[00:33:40] in like a month people still like the
[00:33:41] game then probably
[00:33:43] because I'm just playing it for fun
[00:33:44] right now
[00:33:46] it's it's also too early in the game
[00:33:50] like this is the point of the game where
[00:33:51] people make videos like I ruined my
[00:33:54] account 17 mistakes to not ruin your
[00:33:56] account why I quit starter but like dude
[00:33:59] like you're probably [ __ ] TL like 50
[00:34:01] okay you're probably just like leveled
[00:34:04] one character you don't use anymore and
[00:34:05] it doesn't matter like it's fine
[00:34:13] appreciate it though thanks a lot fair
[00:34:15] enough thanks for the answer yeah
[00:34:19] appreciate it
[00:34:22] oh is I summoned the wind in clouds Chad
[00:34:26] you guys remember yo who who is old
[00:34:28] enough to remember back when shields
[00:34:30] used to take damage during iframes so
[00:34:32] you would shield and then burst on drong
[00:34:34] Lee which takes six years and then when
[00:34:35] you're out of your burst The Shield's
[00:34:36] gone I remember I remember I remember
[00:34:39] that's actually a pretty recent change
[00:34:40] so you should remember too you should
[00:34:42] also remember do you know what else I
[00:34:43] remember
[00:34:46] I don't know
[00:34:49] oh Chad do you guys know this okay so
[00:34:52] apparently
[00:34:54] you guys know how like in the old days
[00:34:56] they use like catapults for war and [ __ ]
[00:34:58] yeah apparently are like historic
[00:35:01] catapult or whatever was like
[00:35:02] discoveries I don't know if you guys saw
[00:35:03] the news but there's like a catapult
[00:35:04] that was like recovered or some [ __ ] and
[00:35:06] it's going to like a museum and
[00:35:07] apparently like one of my ancestors had
[00:35:09] the rights for that so we're getting
[00:35:11] like compensated but since I don't want
[00:35:13] to accept money because I don't want to
[00:35:14] be like
[00:35:15] I don't know I feel like it's just weird
[00:35:16] if I they give me like a bunch of money
[00:35:18] that I don't feel I deserve I just asked
[00:35:19] them to give me a resin instead which is
[00:35:21] why today we have 640 resin so that we
[00:35:23] could actually spend on Vermillion for
[00:35:24] better content in the Stream without it
[00:35:26] being like too unrelatable like I'm not
[00:35:28] trying to get like a house for free okay
[00:35:30] that sounds weird and I want to be
[00:35:32] relatable so they give me a little
[00:35:34] second half is see how usable first half
[00:35:36] I have him double crowned and yes yes
[00:35:39] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
[00:35:41] yes yes yes
[00:35:43] if you can play a rational second half
[00:35:45] and you have a hyper-invested child
[00:35:47] first half you should be fine because I
[00:35:49] played it worse team than rational and
[00:35:51] had child first half and was fine
[00:35:52] granted my shout isn't relatable
[00:35:55] but we can try it again honestly
[00:35:58] if I'm not demotivated after the
[00:35:59] randomizer I'll try to do it clear with
[00:36:01] chow where I take off a circlet
[00:36:05] oh Thursday yeah like if if we have time
[00:36:09] I'll do a clear with my child just no
[00:36:10] circulate so it's like kind of relatable
[00:36:12] and then whatever the [ __ ] that ratio is
[00:36:14] like this no I mean that's kind of I'd
[00:36:16] probably adjust the artifacts to make it
[00:36:18] a bit worse I mean a bit better but yeah
[00:36:21] [ __ ] was I wearing
[00:36:30] this is like uh there's a gifted
[00:36:33] appreciate it
[00:36:38] oh I have to go there I almost db'd out
[00:36:53] last time you went Deathmatch yeah but
[00:36:56] I've done no circling clears before
[00:37:00] I've also cleared 12-1 I don't think I
[00:37:02] did the whole a bit so I remember three
[00:37:03] starring 12-1 with a beginner's
[00:37:04] protector
[00:37:06] but that was an old Abyss like I don't
[00:37:08] know if this Abyss is just like harder
[00:37:09] so I'd have to see I mean it is harder
[00:37:12] but like I'd have to see like if it's
[00:37:13] still doable
[00:37:15] wait can you can you meow me out here is
[00:37:17] this oh yeah she climbs it yeah I'm
[00:37:20] lucky
[00:37:23] oh you can oh you can do it in cat form
[00:37:25] wait wait let me reset let me reset let
[00:37:27] me reset it let me say wait I want to
[00:37:28] try that I don't know you can do that
[00:37:30] wait wait wait run it back
[00:37:32] wait there's actually metal there's
[00:37:34] actually meta
[00:37:43] Glide or it breaks the cat form okay
[00:37:47] oh
[00:37:49] okay I have to break it
[00:37:52] down that's actually pretty lit
[00:37:55] okay last one is here
[00:37:57] I haven't done my daily questions in so
[00:37:58] long because I I literally fell asleep
[00:38:00] yesterday before doing dailies it was
[00:38:02] tragic I was gonna stream
[00:38:06] glendonated 53 dollars oh wait is that
[00:38:10] that okay thank you for the advice for
[00:38:12] link
[00:38:13] oh [ __ ] no way you just plinked
[00:38:16] though you donate fifty dollars to plink
[00:38:19] thank you I appreciate it you didn't
[00:38:21] have to but I appreciate it and I hope
[00:38:23] you can clear the events keep me updated
[00:38:33] you receive one love for each plink
[00:38:36] spammed deal
[00:38:38] okay thanks for 13 months Dreamer
[00:38:40] why was there a trade offer in my chat
[00:38:44] but yeah like I'm not saying you don't
[00:38:46] need Beto that's not what I was trying
[00:38:49] to say like Beto's really good because
[00:38:50] she's one of the strongest right now
[00:38:52] because against two enemies Beto's like
[00:38:54] exceptionally good so using beta was
[00:38:55] like a really good like four star option
[00:38:57] for the first half but it's not like the
[00:39:00] only one you can use that's also not
[00:39:01] necessarily the best like you might have
[00:39:02] better red dogs under bits
[00:39:10] uh are we done wait how are we not done
[00:39:12] our dailies turn off in it oh
[00:39:14] have to go back here
[00:39:19] so I don't have to level up her level 50
[00:39:20] weapon yes level up her 50 weapon
[00:39:24] I see a dreamer
[00:39:31] is shatter Chong Yoon viable stare okay
[00:39:35] I wanna I know for a fact that if I say
[00:39:38] no someone's gonna like
[00:39:40] put that at the start of their
[00:39:42] compilation of Chong Yun shatter
[00:39:43] clearing the abyss so I'm not gonna say
[00:39:46] no but I'm gonna say it is not advised
[00:39:49] is there a QR guide yes there is on well
[00:39:52] I don't know exclamation mark YouTube at
[00:39:54] that click of the second
[00:39:55] it's on my channel
[00:40:04] 's probably fine first off you could
[00:40:05] play Sino Beto dendro and then Hydro
[00:40:08] Maybe
[00:40:10] you don't have a Healer you can play
[00:40:12] like uh no no you need fast you need
[00:40:14] like nahida
[00:40:17] because if you play like Kirara that's
[00:40:18] not of dendro then you'd go no hydro and
[00:40:20] then Sino Quicken is fine but it Thai
[00:40:23] problems better
[00:40:24] but you probably still could you could
[00:40:25] probably do Sino Beto then either Nikita
[00:40:28] and then a Healer or like kokomi or you
[00:40:31] could do if you don't have Nikita you
[00:40:32] could do like Sino Beto then like a
[00:40:35] dendro healer like yaoyao or Kirara for
[00:40:37] The Shield or baiju and then another
[00:40:40] dendro no no you don't need another you
[00:40:42] could do like a Nemo you could do like
[00:40:43] Kaza or Zhang Lee
[00:40:44] I'm actually gonna try it I just don't
[00:40:46] the thing with sign was like I really
[00:40:48] like Shadow but I think Sino people that
[00:40:50] play Sano Quicken are the people that
[00:40:51] like pull from and then regret them but
[00:40:53] I feel like quick Bloom is like so good
[00:40:55] look a lot better
[00:40:58] my sister enemies Justin off
[00:41:02] yeah and you have Beto hits two and then
[00:41:04] you're just like pogging
[00:41:08] foreign
[00:41:24] yes but also okay I I don't think sound
[00:41:26] is broken but so I know in quick Bloom
[00:41:28] is pretty good because you actually get
[00:41:29] a lot of value from Quick looming
[00:41:30] whereas in Quicken he's still not bad
[00:41:32] like still fine it's just like a lot of
[00:41:35] people would be like okay well I pulled
[00:41:36] Sino for Quicken but kuching's better
[00:41:38] here so why am I using Sino which like
[00:41:40] is fair but it's like in Quicken and
[00:41:42] quick Bloom like hyperbloom with cooking
[00:41:43] then it's like Kuching can't really do
[00:41:45] that
[00:41:47] what is quick move it's just Quicken and
[00:41:48] hyperloom
[00:41:49] Ellie those are two months
[00:41:55] is thundering furry good it is but you
[00:41:57] have to bark uh every rotation so it
[00:41:59] depends on if you're willing to do that
[00:42:01] or not also if you own dog gears or cat
[00:42:03] ears uh you're gonna increase in damage
[00:42:05] so it depends on like you really
[00:42:09] um chat should I do a boss I've only
[00:42:12] been doing Nikita uh no not the dendro
[00:42:15] boss whatever the [ __ ] it's called I've
[00:42:16] only been doing the the like the week
[00:42:17] two weekly bosses let's try to do all
[00:42:19] three like what's the third one I should
[00:42:20] do try [ __ ] like I feel like ride and

[00:50:32] they'll be like no actually I wanted
[00:50:33] this other answer which is correct so
[00:50:35] it's [ __ ] stupid honestly the the
[00:50:37] biggest point of advice drunk ecology

[00:50:41] um biggest piece of advice other than

[00:50:45] efficiently is uh low-key if you're in
[00:50:48] like uni like for like law school
[00:50:50] especially you should probably contest
[00:50:53] your grades if you got the wrong answer
[00:50:55] but you think it's correct because a lot
[00:50:57] of the times you can like argue
[00:50:59] uh which I did a lot and it helps
[00:51:03] like like if like
[00:51:12] I've done that engineering yeah it's
[00:51:14] true in a lot of like domain what the

[00:54:06] bettered my account other than deepwood
[00:54:07] like I farm Depot I got good Depot
[00:54:09] pieces but other than that I feel like

[00:54:12] like my account has been stuck
[00:54:20] dude like look I have dude I don't even
[00:54:22] have that many emblem sets
[00:54:27] true we did oh okay we didn't get good
[00:54:29] strong box pieces strong box kind of
[00:54:31] saved us because we got like some
[00:54:32] Crimson witch from Starbucks and some
[00:54:33] thundering Fury
[00:54:46] showers crying nobody cares about your
[00:54:48] accounts asks why did you tag me
[00:54:56] foreign
[00:55:01] people got banned in my Discord because
[00:55:03] there was screenshots of them being
[00:55:04] weird in another server which we can't
[00:55:06] moderate over which is why I hate when
[00:55:08] idiots in general try are like oh join
[00:55:09] another server without mods like shit's
[00:55:12] bound to happen but anyways and then
[00:55:13] some people were like
[00:55:15] ended up being like weird or mean or
[00:55:17] like transphobic or like racist so we
[00:55:19] just banned them because why the [ __ ]
[00:55:20] would I keep people like that on my
[00:55:21] server so I don't but I don't oversee
[00:55:24] [ __ ] like that like I'm not I don't
[00:55:25] moderate like I have mods who do [ __ ] I
[00:55:27] don't because like why the [ __ ] would I
[00:55:29] why would I want a server if all it does
[00:55:33] is take time out of my day like I don't
[00:55:34] have time for that so like I like it
[00:55:36] it's cool and like I like to like you
[00:55:38] know I want to be able to like talk
[00:55:40] there but I don't want to be able to
[00:55:41] like I don't have to like do mod stuff
[00:55:44] that's why and that's why we had mod
[00:55:46] apps that have been open uh and we I
[00:55:49] think we have like
[00:55:50] we're opening mod interviews now from
[00:55:52] the people in the apps so that we might
[00:55:53] get like six to seven to eight new mods
[00:55:55] because we need more uh so yeah that's
[00:55:58] what happened oh this looks should I
[00:56:00] lock this yeah
[00:56:08] okay uh to be fair we we banned all the
[00:56:11] ones that were like that did batshit and
[00:56:13] then the other ones that were like
[00:56:14] Associated we gave a warning because I
[00:56:16] felt like it's more appropriate to be
[00:56:18] like ban all the people that were weird
[00:56:20] and then the other people are just like
[00:56:21] Warren yeah
[00:56:27] interviews Keck L what is just making
[00:56:29] sure they're normal basically it's like
[00:56:31] mod AP looks good but make sure they're
[00:56:33] not like weird and then you just like
[00:56:35] talk to them a bit and then see
[00:56:37] that's basically it
[00:56:39] yeah

[01:04:15] or you could do like I mean you can do

[01:11:52] number
[01:11:53] everyone shot us at a different number

[01:12:22] yo pork is seven months
[01:12:25] explain to me how casual Works in a
[01:12:26] Gandhi team it doesn't if you put it

[01:12:29] change team please please as someone
[01:12:32] who's played kazuaganu please run please
[01:12:35] don't do it please please please please
[01:12:40] please you have to swirl the cryo when
[01:12:42] the bloom blooms it's the most on if
[01:12:44] anything misses you lose the entire
[01:12:46] purpose of the character and then
[01:12:48] between rotations you have to reset up
[01:12:50] everything and if any residual element
[01:12:52] is on anyone it's [ __ ] ass
[01:12:56] what it's literally true it is the most
[01:12:59] annoying [ __ ] to play in the world just
[01:13:00] play shangling
[01:13:02] you're playing Bennett kozua and you're
[01:13:04] playing Kazo instead of shangling just
[01:13:06] [ __ ] play shangling
[01:13:09] uh
[01:13:11] uh it's really good
[01:13:15] oh did you say icon I said ganyu yeah
[01:13:21] Primo guy there's a dear one
[01:13:29] if kokomi and huta works then everything
[01:13:32] works
[01:13:34] who said kokomi huta Works who's playing
[01:13:37] kokomi Hotel
[01:13:41] who is playing that theme
[01:13:50] who the [ __ ] is playing that
[01:13:54] here you are
[01:13:56] if you want
[01:13:59] you offended the hotel Mains well dude I
[01:14:01] play with how a lot I play kokomi a lot
[01:14:03] I just don't play them together
[01:14:09] you can swirl the Hydra from kokomi and
[01:14:12] vape with Casa and vape
[01:14:15] sheesh I mean true
[01:14:18] that sounds that sounds that sounds meta
[01:14:34] okay emblem feels too efficient that it
[01:14:36] feels inefficient so let's go do like
[01:14:39] a less efficient domain I think we
[01:14:41] should do the Hydro One like this one
[01:14:43] because this could be good for like
[01:14:44] focalore you know
[01:14:46] uh we could also do like
[01:14:49] um
[01:14:51] oh me so far there's a 10 gifted
[01:14:53] appreciate it
[01:14:55] oh I can do Gilda deepwood
[01:14:59] actually
[01:15:02] yeah let's do Gilda deepwood because
[01:15:04] this will be added to the strong box
[01:15:05] though might as well
[01:15:12] [Music]
[01:15:17] what four star light cone on Sealy dude
[01:15:20] okay this is not there you can get a
[01:15:22] free five star one get the one from uh
[01:15:24] simulated Universe it's free the fox
[01:15:26] sounds pretty good you can also like
[01:15:27] swordplay or like some other ones but
[01:15:29] yeah
[01:15:35] thank you
[01:15:38] they're on character
[01:15:53] foreign
[01:16:00] box we don't know we can just infer now
[01:16:04] given the fact that the monstadian sets
[01:16:07] were all added or when I like when super
[01:16:09] came out the first batch of sets were
[01:16:11] added we can infer that all the inazumin
[01:16:14] uh sets will be added to the strong box
[01:16:15] we don't know if it's true we don't know
[01:16:16] if it'll happen but we can assume hope
[01:16:18] and pray
[01:16:21] wait Chad I have a question
[01:16:23] why was this domain not added
[01:16:26] does anyone know was it too late was it
[01:16:28] released too late why is this one added
[01:16:30] is this considered Inazuma like what
[01:16:32] happened
[01:16:36] added too late
[01:16:39] it was like 1.4
[01:16:41] okay no I'm just asking because like
[01:16:44] since that's late that means that the
[01:16:45] the Vermillion is is early enough though
[01:16:47] Vermillion is early enough so familiar
[01:16:49] will be added right I'm just making sure
[01:16:50] what's up YouTube I'm just making sure
[01:16:53] next is my release order okay so
[01:16:55] vermillions coming yeah for Millions
[01:16:57] yeah for Millions yeah yeah everybody's
[01:16:59] got it yeah yeah everyone is coming
[01:17:00] because Chasm yep
[01:17:07] what's gonna happen
[01:17:12] [Music]
[01:17:22] dude why would they skip it like why
[01:17:26] although honestly like
[01:17:28] it kind of if it does like I obviously I
[01:17:31] hope it gets added to strongbox but if
[01:17:33] it does it kind of invalidates like how
[01:17:36] dumb it was for me to grind Vermilion
[01:17:38] because like let's say like okay or like
[01:17:40] it adds on to it because if it's in the
[01:17:42] strong box and my Vermillion set sucks
[01:17:44] then why didn't I just wait for it to
[01:17:45] come on the strongbox but if it isn't in
[01:17:47] the strong box then it's efficient it's
[01:17:49] like oh [ __ ] he has so much Vermilion
[01:17:51] and it's not even in the strong box what
[01:17:54] a dedicated ciao lover
[01:17:56] I missed the song what's up
[01:18:00] get with me
[01:18:06] 50 subs and vermillions in the small box
[01:18:08] okay
[01:18:20] foreign
[01:18:27] no copium
[01:18:33] yeah oh no not considerably kokomi is
[01:18:36] better than Barbara and anily Bloom but
[01:18:37] it's not like the biggest deal if you
[01:18:40] have enough [ __ ] to make your Barber
[01:18:41] uptime good so like if you ever C2 and
[01:18:43] Sack brags it's fine
[01:18:45] like Google is better but like it's not
[01:18:48] like the biggest deal
[01:18:53] here you are
[01:18:57] you are uh so everyone compared to like
[01:19:00] like the difference between kokomi and
[01:19:01] Barbara and like uh ayaka or a ganyu
[01:19:04] team or something is like a lot higher
[01:19:06] than in like a newly Bloom team
[01:19:08] because both of them can stack yeah and
[01:19:09] both of them can heal you and both of
[01:19:10] them can like prog blooms right
[01:19:13] okay maybe I should just go do Abyss
[01:19:14] because yeah our resin's on caps we'll
[01:19:15] do this at this run
[01:19:18] are you gonna watch the new Fast and
[01:19:19] Furious I did
[01:19:21] I liked how stupid it was I don't care
[01:19:24] I don't care anymore like they're kind
[01:19:25] of self-aware that it's just stupid so
[01:19:27] when I before I go into the movie I I
[01:19:29] tell myself that it's recorded in an
[01:19:31] alternate universe with slightly
[01:19:33] different physics where anyone that
[01:19:35] touches a car turns into a superhero and
[01:19:37] then when you think of it as a superhero
[01:19:38] movie it's actually really good
[01:19:40] do you watch this new Spider-Man I'm
[01:19:43] going to but I haven't yet
[01:19:51] like if you think of Fast and Furious
[01:19:53] movies as superhero movies
[01:19:55] that like like they're superheroes as
[01:19:57] soon as they touch oh a wrong set but oh
[01:20:00] if this was still still good still good
[01:20:04] this could be really really good okay
[01:20:06] we're gonna level it we're gonna level
[01:20:07] it
[01:20:14] oh also as randomly I watched I was with
[01:20:17] zaj right and we watched the [ __ ] we
[01:20:20] watched the one piece movie like Z or
[01:20:22] whatever is pretty good I like that one
[01:20:23] that character is cool but I haven't
[01:20:24] even watched one piece but the the movie
[01:20:26] was good
[01:20:38] oh okay that's a lot of fact
[01:20:59] all right we have a HP goblet oh sorry
[01:21:02] [ __ ] oh I just cursed it
[01:21:05] we have a hydro goblet with crit rate
[01:21:08] crit damage and energy recharge three
[01:21:10] amazing stats for basically every Hydro
[01:21:12] character flat HP sucks but we're not
[01:21:14] gonna roll into it
[01:21:16] We're Not Gonna Roll into it
[01:21:18] and then we're gonna get criterate crit
[01:21:19] damage even energy recharge all of them
[01:21:21] are great
[01:21:22] so uh we're gonna roll them
[01:21:25] and two habits
[01:21:28] good for a five user so far so good this
[01:21:30] could be good for your lawn it could be
[01:21:32] good for sincho could be good for for
[01:21:34] you know ioto needs a bit of ER I don't
[01:21:36] could use some Er
[01:21:39] is going to come out in version 4.2 or
[01:21:42] 4.3 she's gonna need around 140 energy
[01:21:45] recharge to 160 depending on your team I
[01:21:48] like to run her with five supports so I
[01:21:49] go a bit lower like 130 140 uh and then
[01:21:52] she can use her burst on cooldown uh and
[01:21:54] then I can stack criterate and crit
[01:21:55] damage on the other
[01:21:57] that's still good it's still good it's
[01:21:58] still good it's still good it's still
[01:21:58] good it's still good still good still
[01:22:00] good yeah as long as that's not HP is
[01:22:02] good it's fine it's fine it's fine it's
[01:22:04] fine it's still fine it's still fine the
[01:22:07] rest are gonna be crit and then we're
[01:22:08] good
[01:22:10] I'm kind of low and more up and one of
[01:22:12] my thing punishments today is Crown Daya
[01:22:14] so I don't want to waste on my Mora but
[01:22:17] we don't really have uh whatever [ __ ] it
[01:22:21] foreign
[01:22:34] dude okay it's not even bad but why am I
[01:22:38] cursed
[01:22:39] why am I curse to only roll ER man just

[01:23:03] Giants gigadengiel
[01:23:09] true
[01:23:15] Hydro Park no no dude farzan just needs
[01:23:17] ER as long as you have ER it doesn't
[01:23:19] matter what your main stats are this is
[01:23:21] a ER main style that's all that matters
[01:23:24] all right if we get crit race that would
[01:23:26] be the best crit damage would be second
[01:23:26] best the already third best HP would
[01:23:28] make me uninstall
[01:23:30] foreign
[01:23:34] it's good it's good it's a lot of rolls
[01:23:37] it's good it's good it's just not
[01:23:40] amazing it's good it's just not amazing
[01:23:44] y'all remember
[01:23:49] it's okay Chad it's okay like dude dude
[01:23:54] dude some people okay have no artifacts
[01:23:56] some people don't have hydrophones the
[01:23:59] means to have good artifacts and I'm
[01:24:02] grateful that I have this
[01:24:07] also I have do you guys want to see a
[01:24:09] Hydra goblet I'm not using are you ready
[01:24:10] at Pepe W look at a hydro goblet I'm not
[01:24:12] using right now look this is what I'm
[01:24:14] not using like okay listen I have a lot
[01:24:18] of hydro goblets it is probably my best
[01:24:21] goblet uh so I don't know if we're gonna
[01:24:23] use the ER one but it is good on
[01:24:25] farazone so we're gonna put on Frozen
[01:24:29] because the thing is no one can use the
[01:24:31] goblets like my itel has an onset one
[01:24:33] that's echoes
[01:24:35] and then Yolanda has an onset one that's
[01:24:37] emblem
[01:24:39] but this one's not that great so maybe
[01:24:40] if we get a better emblem like
[01:24:42] Sans we could use the offset Hydro so we
[01:24:45] have to farm emblem wow it's not just
[01:24:47] gonna Farm emblem
[01:24:49] well Central also has an emblem one
[01:24:51] I guess child but child has a
[01:24:56] how does this

[01:27:09] holy they are yeah see like they are
[01:27:14] still
[01:27:16] I guess we didn't pull that much
[01:27:20] why does my font look like that I don't
[01:27:22] actually know
[01:27:23] yeah it does look different I thought it
[01:27:25] was just an update is it an update I
[01:27:27] don't know why it looks like that
[01:27:29] I thought it was just an update
[01:27:32] bro hacked okay
[01:27:35] it's not a hack dude it's not a hack
[01:27:37] yeah I like them
[01:27:42] album Mr socks
[01:27:46] the New York Times the fight the font
[01:27:49] wait is this not the new one I feel like
[01:27:51] it's the new one
[01:27:54] it does look worse I will admit
[01:27:57] am I close to standard Banner five star
[01:27:59] we can do like
[01:28:01] we might have free pool oh no we're not
[01:28:03] oh yeah I got another Atlas
[01:28:09] it's not for me
[01:28:12] wait why does my phone look like that
[01:28:14] what happened
[01:28:17] what happened to my account
[01:28:20] what happened to my account just Chad
[01:28:23] Hope
[01:28:24] settings wait no way it's a setting
[01:28:26] there is no way it's a setting I'd be
[01:28:28] cool I hope it is there's no way
[01:28:34] there's no [ __ ] way it's a setting
[01:28:40] yeah one guy
[01:28:42] bro gets banned tomorrow for what what
[01:28:45] did I do
[01:28:50] maybe if I restart the game yeah yeah
[01:28:52] maybe if I restart the game but I'm not
[01:28:53] gonna like who cares it's fine but yeah
[01:28:55] maybe if you restart the game it might
[01:28:56] have like failed to load
[01:29:07] do you think I could DPS Banner for this
[01:29:10] Abyss yo unironically yeah
[01:29:13] probably you could like Mel Bennett is
[01:29:16] probably good
[01:29:19] Mel Bennett is probably good here and
[01:29:21] then Thunderman if would be annoying to
[01:29:23] fight but you could probably still do it
[01:29:24] and then this guy would be annoying but
[01:29:25] if you have the elements it'd be fine
[01:29:27] but unironically melt better would
[01:29:29] probably be fine for second half
[01:29:32] which is like the hard part
[01:29:33] claim rewards no I have to leave it so
[01:29:36] that you guys get anxiety like I'll keep
[01:29:38] one not claims lost underscorezoro
[01:29:41] donated five dollars who benefits most
[01:29:43] from an HP Circ with 38.9 Crete date NG
[01:29:48] it's probably Elon you could go ER Sans
[01:29:50] HP circulate
[01:29:52] with 39 crit damage on it but [ __ ] you
[01:29:54] for having that but yeah Elon could use
[01:29:56] it uh pretty nicely
[01:30:01] it's like it's the difference between
[01:30:03] credit and H manual on depends on how
[01:30:05] much HP you have but it's usually stops
[01:30:06] that like it's pretty close like crit is
[01:30:08] usually like slightly better so you
[01:30:09] could just go HP I'm pretty sure my Elan
[01:30:11] is used on HP but right now she's uh
[01:30:14] Just Dance
[01:30:19] okay it's randomizer time I really want
[01:30:22] to just test teams and have fun and play
[01:30:23] a normal team and do normal content and
[01:30:26] just have a normal stream where I'm
[01:30:27] happy but I think it's time to just get
[01:30:29] the randomizer out of the way so I can
[01:30:31] move on with Team testing uh you know
[01:30:34] we'll try like some four star teams
[01:30:35] we'll try some teams you guys have been
[01:30:36] telling me to do will uh Farm some
[01:30:39] artifacts we'll go play Star rail after
[01:30:41] as well get some silver wolf prep in uh
[01:30:44] we'll play some [ __ ] Ceno we'll have
[01:30:46] fun
[01:30:47] but first we unfortunately are going to
[01:30:50] have to randomize some stuff now let me
[01:30:52] make sure every character is in this
[01:30:53] randomizer uh yes every character is
[01:30:57] well
[01:30:58] uh let me explain to you guys how this
[01:30:59] is gonna work so one sec let me open all
[01:31:02] of the Google Chrome tabs I need
[01:31:12] you are not having fun be honest
[01:31:14] I have never had fun
[01:31:18] thank you you're welcome
[01:31:21] Chad what team should I do for my intro
[01:31:23] we need a team for my intro
[01:31:30] okay let's remove everyone from this
[01:31:31] team oh
[01:31:38] get them
[01:31:49] let's do Kirara we'll be a cat
[01:31:52] okay
[01:31:55] do you like hedgehogs why are you back
[01:31:57] why is that Hedgehog person back
[01:32:00] this dude I swear they took like a one
[01:32:03] year break from my stream and came back
[01:32:05] to asking about hedgehogs
[01:32:11] so Jeff follows this person on Twitter
[01:32:14] do you enjoy hedgehogs opinion on
[01:32:16] hedgehogs take on hedgehogs
[01:32:18] are you in favor of the animal known as
[01:32:20] hedgehog Hedgehog emoji
[01:32:23] I should bad them to not ruin my video I
[01:32:25] I listen yo chill I like hedgehogs
[01:32:29] they're cool
[01:32:30] uh yeah that's it
[01:32:35] yeah
[01:32:38] wait Chad what's the lowest frame rate
[01:32:39] you can go only 30.
[01:32:41] can you even tell
[01:32:43] like I definitely can't though
[01:32:46] can you guys tell though
[01:32:49] I'm like Loki getting I mean it's not
[01:32:51] it's not that bad I play it 30 on mobile
[01:32:52] I think but
[01:32:54] yeah I'm kind of getting dizzy
[01:32:57] I'm actually kind of getting dizzy
[01:33:02] yeah
[01:33:03] dude just wait until there's 140 FPS on
[01:33:06] [ __ ] PC you guys won't be ready for
[01:33:08] the string quality
[01:33:10] what is pilk oh you guys saw the
[01:33:15] okay let's explain it okay I need to
[01:33:17] start with an intro
[01:33:21] oh I hit my
[01:33:30] does twitch even allow 140 FPS yes Q
[01:33:33] system as well I don't know how it works
[01:33:35] but I know like Valor and streamers
[01:33:36] streaming like a thousand FPS it doesn't
[01:33:38] go to the stream but like it looks
[01:33:39] smoother in game I'm pretty sure
[01:33:40] I don't know I'm not sure how it works
[01:33:42] I'm a dumbass I know it feels better
[01:33:43] when you're playing but I don't know if
[01:33:45] this stream is different or not
[01:33:50] mx621
[01:33:52] it can stream it to 120. I see
[01:33:57] hmm
[01:33:59] still get the
[01:34:04] art disclaimer disclaimer
[01:34:06] I'm gonna have to gear the characters I
[01:34:08] randomize so don't get mad at me when
[01:34:10] I'm gearing don't be like oh my God I
[01:34:11] can [ __ ] you okay we have to be
[01:34:13] efficient now
[01:34:15] here's what's gonna happen
[01:34:16] let's start recording the video so first
[01:34:19] of all
[01:34:23] turn into a cat
[01:34:25] hey didn't see you there you might be
[01:34:27] wondering why are you a cat box
[01:34:31] now I have to wait nine seconds again
[01:34:40] you might be wondering why are you a cat
[01:34:42] box good question because today we're
[01:34:44] gonna suffer
[01:34:47] that didn't make sense
[01:34:49] anyways last time a few bits ago I did
[01:34:53] Abyss randomizer challenge it wasn't fun
[01:34:56] we lost our Charles Jay spear we lost my
[01:34:58] best no less feather
[01:35:00] as we'll do it again this new Abyss as a
[01:35:03] recording 3.7 is the hardest one we've
[01:35:05] gotten by far now I know there's gonna
[01:35:06] be people being like zocks I cleared it
[01:35:08] first try it was easy no it wasn't [ __ ]
[01:35:10] you
[01:35:12] sorry that was mean it's it's not like
[01:35:14] so it's the hardest in the sense that
[01:35:15] it's the most restrictive you need very
[01:35:16] specific elements like pyro second half
[01:35:18] and then either a specific set of
[01:35:20] characters that can work first half so
[01:35:22] it's pretty restrictive which means
[01:35:23] randomizing it is the dumbest thing you
[01:35:25] could do so we're gonna make it Dumber
[01:35:28] by randomizing it but also
[01:35:33] having a punishment for every death so
[01:35:35] what we're gonna do is every time we die
[01:35:37] we're gonna spin a wheel of unfun
[01:35:39] consequences which I'll show you guys
[01:35:41] and every time
[01:35:45] since
[01:35:46] and I just jumped by hitting my desk I
[01:35:50] hit my desk my Kiara jump
[01:35:52] and we'll do a temple every time we have
[01:35:54] to change teams like reset the re-roll
[01:35:56] because obviously I want it to be random
[01:35:57] but since this Abyss needs so many
[01:35:59] specific elements
[01:36:01] I should open this if I'm gonna say it
[01:36:07] but like but this is the basically so
[01:36:09] many elements because there's like this
[01:36:10] thing that needs specific elements and
[01:36:12] there's like these guys and you kind of
[01:36:13] need a shield or a Healer or something
[01:36:15] if we have to reset or like re-roll the
[01:36:17] team we'll do a temple
[01:36:19] so that there's like a pay like I pull
[01:36:21] you pull if I come I roll
[01:36:24] don't put that in the video anyways so
[01:36:26] that's what's happening
[01:36:28] um
[01:36:29] Chad don't say hi to YouTube they don't
[01:36:31] like you
[01:36:32] I'm sorry that was toxic let me show you
[01:36:34] guys what the wheel is
[01:36:38] so in order to make this interesting
[01:36:42] I wrote a wheel with a bunch of
[01:36:43] consequences some of which were also in
[01:36:45] the last video some of which are new and
[01:36:47] they won't be fun so here's what we have
[01:36:51] we have delete a random plus 20 artifact
[01:36:54] we'll randomize then we'll delete it if
[01:36:56] it's
[01:36:56] if it's like 50 crit value maybe I'll
[01:36:58] scam you guys but uh anything else we'll
[01:37:01] do it
[01:37:02] also I said
[01:37:04] I forgot to say but I have to say that
[01:37:07] at 5 30 I have to BRB quickly and I just
[01:37:09] remembered because I saw in my house and
[01:37:11] I I forgot to I have to BRB the Jeff is
[01:37:14] naked again I
[01:37:17] one sec
[01:37:19] I said I'd have to one sec
[01:37:23] one sec Actually I don't even need to
[01:37:25] close my webcam
[01:37:56] okay sorry I'm back I just had to warn
[01:37:58] them that I was gonna be screaming like
[01:37:59] a monkey so not to be afraid
[01:38:02] uh where's my camp
[01:38:04] boom
[01:38:06] wait I deactivated it
[01:38:10] oh
[01:38:11] oh also if you are wondering like if
[01:38:13] you're wondering like oh zox why are you
[01:38:15] so bright today it looks like your house
[01:38:16] ascended to heaven true no not true but
[01:38:18] there's like lighting because I'm
[01:38:19] streaming during the day for the first
[01:38:21] time in my life so it's not dark
[01:38:28] turn off your cam again
[01:38:31] that wasn't funny anyways here's what
[01:38:33] the wheel has we have the lead plus 20
[01:38:34] artifact random We have crown Dale which
[01:38:37] you know we love Dale she's pretty not
[01:38:39] the strongest but pretty we have Chad
[01:38:41] tweets on my account which I really
[01:38:42] don't want because you guys are I don't
[01:38:45] [ __ ] trust you guys like it feels
[01:38:47] like another chat like maybe like other
[01:38:49] chats would be like Ahah like something
[01:38:52] funny but you guys
[01:38:55] yes you guys but whatever
[01:38:58] we have political five star we have 50
[01:39:00] pulls we have 10 volts so different
[01:39:01] variations of pulling
[01:39:04] uh and these are fine because like I
[01:39:07] don't really need any of the characters
[01:39:08] on the banner but I kind of want Kirara
[01:39:09] constellation so I don't mind too much
[01:39:12] we have a shot of extra spicy hot sauce
[01:39:14] because last time we did Tabasco this
[01:39:16] time I'll do a ghost pepper sauce we
[01:39:18] have Korean fire noodles similar we have
[01:39:20] where cat ears
[01:39:23] and meow
[01:39:25] no no I'm not gonna be
[01:39:28] maybe maybe I mean
[01:39:33] no I don't think I should
[01:39:38] no I'm not gonna meow
[01:39:41] because if yeah I was gonna get
[01:39:46] fine we're not gonna get it though we
[01:39:48] have made outfit stream but this will be
[01:39:50] for a difference like if I roll this
[01:39:51] it'll be for fountains releases like
[01:39:53] it'll be another stream next stream
[01:39:54] something it can't be today because I'm
[01:39:55] not getting naked but it'll be another
[01:39:56] time but if we roll it we'll do one we
[01:39:59] have no swearing we have R5 Royal
[01:40:01] grimoire because if you don't know Royal
[01:40:02] weapons are the worst in the game don't
[01:40:04] get them but I will if we roll it
[01:40:06] hopefully we don't we have drink pilk if
[01:40:08] you don't know what pilk is it's
[01:40:14] it's Pepsi with milk I don't know I
[01:40:27] pilk is not a punishment
[01:40:31] wait really is it not bad I'll delete it
[01:40:33] if it's not bad
[01:40:34] whatever I wait what did you say
[01:40:38] call add called retude as a punishment I
[01:40:40] have calls to Jeff
[01:40:45] okay fine we'll change it and you're too
[01:40:49] there you go there's a group chat
[01:40:56] okay we have new freestyle live
[01:40:58] recording we I don't question that one
[01:41:00] put it out put on makeup and we have
[01:41:02] Fang Gears of character which means it's
[01:41:04] gonna be useless and we're gonna have to
[01:41:05] re-roll because we're gonna lose and
[01:41:07] then the last one is you must subscribe
[01:41:08] which is just a freebie so if we get
[01:41:09] that we're safe but everyone has to
[01:41:11] subscribe it's just it is what it is
[01:41:12] it's called hey corepa is just business
[01:41:14] so that's what we're doing
[01:41:18] and every time with the reroll team it's
[01:41:19] minus temples or plus temples
[01:41:24] is pilk penis milk no it's not it is
[01:41:27] Pepsi milk it is why did I even read
[01:41:29] that why did I read that okay catch it
[01:41:31] back
[01:41:32] oh no wait wait before we do that
[01:41:34] actually yeah
[01:41:39] so with that in mind what we're gonna do
[01:41:40] is the following we're gonna do four
[01:41:42] eleven and twelve eleven should be easy
[01:41:43] but it's still this was annoying like
[01:41:45] there's still elements you need it's
[01:41:46] still [ __ ] dumb so we're gonna do 11
[01:41:49] as well uh which is not gonna be fun and
[01:41:51] then we're gonna do 12 and those are the
[01:41:53] only two floors we're gonna do
[01:41:55] um because we don't need to do 910
[01:41:56] because we already did this once
[01:42:02] yeah so what we're gonna do is we're
[01:42:05] gonna randomize our teams now obviously
[01:42:07] I could press random and then it'll give
[01:42:08] us two teams it's just an example this
[01:42:10] isn't what we're using but I could press
[01:42:11] random it'll give us two teams and then
[01:42:13] we could go down like that but I think
[01:42:14] that's not as interesting so what we did
[01:42:16] last time was we'll do four characters
[01:42:17] at a time and then we'll get eight
[01:42:20] or no wait what did last that was we'll
[01:42:21] get eight characters but then we can
[01:42:23] like rearrange them like we'll make two
[01:42:24] teams out of it because if not like what
[01:42:26] if we got two healers on one team or
[01:42:28] like it's just undoable so we're gonna
[01:42:30] have to like we'll be creative with the
[01:42:31] eight characters we get and we'll make
[01:42:33] two teams of them and then we'll go now
[01:42:35] with that in mind it might be impossible
[01:42:37] so every time we have to reroll if it is
[01:42:40] literally impossible because for example
[01:42:41] we don't have a Healer and if you fight
[01:42:43] constipated beasts without a Healer you
[01:42:45] get literally railed against the wall
[01:42:47] it's not fun and if you play second half
[01:42:49] without a pyro character or like two or
[01:42:51] three electrodes you're gonna get [ __ ]
[01:42:52] so we need to make sure it's at least
[01:42:54] feasible and then when it is and every
[01:42:56] time we have to reroll we Temple and
[01:42:57] once it's feasible we're good we go
[01:43:00] like yeah for example these teams
[01:43:02] wouldn't be I don't think we could do it
[01:43:03] because we need pyroc like
[01:43:05] we don't have a Healer do we have Dory
[01:43:09] so yeah
[01:43:12] anyways Let me refresh this
[01:43:14] Maki thanks for 11 months I appreciate
[01:43:17] it
[01:43:19] and alerts are muted for this
[01:43:21] Drew what's up
[01:43:24] Ito probably beats cryo with shatter I
[01:43:27] don't know okay surely surely that works
[01:43:30] I kind of need another coffee this one's
[01:43:32] done wait is it
[01:43:36] Chad do you want some
[01:43:37] you see it I don't want to spill it
[01:43:40] I got a flat white
[01:43:48] no we can't dumb I might go make one
[01:43:59] read the top part of the page randomizer
[01:44:02] with preset teams
[01:44:04] no but this looks wait what if we do
[01:44:06] hardest
[01:44:10] oh this is actually not I mean this
[01:44:12] would be too like
[01:44:16] this would be too easy like it's still
[01:44:18] hard
[01:44:20] but I feel like it'd be easier
[01:44:23] because like yeah like this is these are
[01:44:24] usable teams right
[01:44:26] yeah I think this is the worst we do
[01:44:28] normal
[01:44:29] what is easiest
[01:44:31] wait how is this easy oh virgin yeah
[01:44:33] hardest
[01:44:37] yeah this is too easy this is too easy
[01:44:42] oh also also bonus rule bonus rule bonus
[01:44:45] rule
[01:44:46] I forgot about this so the goal is to
[01:44:49] get a beat to Nine Star each floor but
[01:44:50] that might not be possible if our team
[01:44:52] is like Clee Amber Dory right so as long
[01:44:55] as we clear it we're happy but any Star
[01:44:58] we miss
[01:45:02] wait what do we do for every Miss star
[01:45:03] do we spin the reality Temple
[01:45:20] any Star we miss when we clear it will
[01:45:23] either be a wheel pull or a temple
[01:45:25] either be a wheel spin or a temple I
[01:45:27] haven't decided yet but one of the two
[01:45:28] whatever chat decides I I don't know I'm
[01:45:30] dumb I'm indecisive we'll just say spin
[01:45:32] probably spin but if I'm like if I'm
[01:45:34] like let's say I already spun eight
[01:45:35] times and I'm like in shambles and I'm
[01:45:37] crying on the floor maybe we'll just do
[01:45:39] a temple but yeah so that's what we'll
[01:45:41] do for 11 and 12. all right cool let's
[01:45:42] go do it now
[01:45:44] all right this is our first team
[01:45:46] we'll do four characters at a time just
[01:45:48] so it's like easier to like keep track
[01:45:49] of
[01:45:51] well I should move my face cam right or
[01:45:52] do I just do like
[01:45:54] like this maybe
[01:45:56] there you go
[01:45:59] I would still be holding you like this
[01:46:04] all righty chat
[01:46:13] ready okay these are our first four
[01:46:16] characters
[01:46:18] wait but Chad kind of covers one of them
[01:46:20] what if I zoom in more I can't ah it's
[01:46:22] fine
[01:46:23] or what if I do like
[01:46:25] yeah like this all right our first four
[01:46:36] okay this isn't bad so at the start of
[01:46:39] the stream someone said I hope you get
[01:46:41] Ito in the randomizer so that you can
[01:46:43] use him on full em for crystallize which
[01:46:45] is probably what we're gonna do Psy Is A
[01:46:47] Healer that's good Beto's one of the
[01:46:49] best dps's right now because first half
[01:46:51] has two enemies and then who that was
[01:46:52] good second off so unironically good so
[01:46:55] far
[01:46:57] not ironically good I'm not really good
[01:46:59] let's screenshot this so don't forget
[01:47:01] these are our four characters I'll open
[01:47:02] MS paint boom
[01:47:06] okay
[01:47:08] honestly not bad like seriously is not
[01:47:10] the best dealer sure he does you know
[01:47:12] but hey
[01:47:13] all right what do I want I want another
[01:47:15] healer we need two healers by the way if
[01:47:17] we don't have two healers like we're
[01:47:18] probably just [ __ ] or like prototype
[01:47:20] Amber or something but yeah
[01:47:23] um
[01:47:25] okay one more
[01:47:27] what do I want probably I don't know
[01:47:29] let's go uh hopefully dendro for Beto or
[01:47:32] like an official
[01:47:36] okay this is not a Healer uh
[01:47:40] Toma can Shield I mean hey hey this is
[01:47:43] gonna work this good
[01:47:46] this could work right in Beto don't work
[01:47:49] together but the team's gonna work
[01:47:53] we'd have to play like overload without
[01:47:56] wait let's see let's see let's see this
[01:47:58] unironically dude it actually doesn't
[01:48:00] look bad wait let me see is it dual
[01:48:03] before I decide
[01:48:07] how do I make this like lookable
[01:48:11] plans we made for two
[01:48:17] okay
[01:48:18] um
[01:48:21] they don't dude if Ryan and Beto
[01:48:23] synergized I wish it would be so easy
[01:48:25] but they don't so we'd probably do like
[01:48:27] putau beta overload like hutau Beto
[01:48:33] Toma Ito two Shields no healers and then
[01:48:37] right inside you no you want an email
[01:48:39] character on each team to vape not Vape
[01:48:41] swirl so we'd probably do like
[01:48:45] putau
[01:48:47] Beto
[01:48:54] Beto like we do this would be first team
[01:49:01] control Z
[01:49:05] I make my brush bigger
[01:49:07] this would probably be first team
[01:49:14] oh wait no no [ __ ] yeah we're not using
[01:49:15] silence team you're right but we won't
[01:49:17] venti first half oh dude how are we
[01:49:19] gonna heal first
[01:49:21] because one team wants two Shields and
[01:49:24] then the other team wants a Healer but
[01:49:26] we need venti first half is better isn't
[01:49:27] he or I guess
[01:49:30] I see
[01:49:35] I mean
[01:49:38] yeah he is
[01:49:44] this even doable hutau burst heals
[01:50:01] this is second half and then first half
[01:50:03] would be
[01:50:12] yeah this is a this is a penis
[01:50:18] well this is gonna be doable chat I
[01:50:19] don't know man
[01:50:22] if
[01:50:24] would this even be this is like one star
[01:50:27] if it's not dual real but I mean it
[01:50:29] might be
[01:50:32] foreign
[01:50:40] we could also use this for floor 11 and
[01:50:43] then 12 to another team
[01:50:57] yeah okay this will be our 11 team we'll
[01:50:59] see how it does and then we'll see if we
[01:51:00] real for 12. I don't know I didn't
[01:51:02] decide the rules I just kind of winged
[01:51:03] it I was I thought we're gonna use it
[01:51:05] for both
[01:51:06] I thought we could use it for both
[01:51:07] whatever we'll do for people like more
[01:51:08] team content anyway so we'll do this for
[01:51:10] 11 at least and I'll figure it out all
[01:51:11] right floor 11.
[01:51:14] what if I go in for 11 without gearing
[01:51:16] anyone and I just assume they're geared
[01:51:17] nah I think most of them argued actually
[01:51:19] but say you isn't right in is look at
[01:51:21] this yep yeah okay close literally close
[01:51:23] look we changed one piece and then she's
[01:51:24] geared one piece I love one p
[01:51:28] look we take this from balls boom boom
[01:51:31] boom
[01:51:32] uh I mean you know
[01:51:34] could be better it could be better it
[01:51:36] could be better
[01:51:37] um
[01:51:38] it could be better I need an ER Sans
[01:51:46] this is not ironically not that bad it
[01:51:47] only has one crit rate a credential but
[01:51:49] it has a lot of er not bad
[01:51:55] we'll just take all of Kaya's pieces
[01:51:56] boom and then ER Sans
[01:52:00] [Music]
[01:52:03] where is it
[01:52:05] there it is Boom
[01:52:06] should be a good writing oh I'm in 61.4
[01:52:09] is
[01:52:11] kind of dog [ __ ] wait we have too much
[01:52:13] ER low-key maybe we do like

[01:52:27] that has oh my God wait
[01:52:31] 71.9 what
[01:52:35] okay Chad what piece okay listen uh we
[01:52:39] could do
[01:52:41] yeah we'll do this one
[01:52:43] set it up by nine 140 one to two ratio
[01:52:46] 275 VR and coffee lightning now most of
[01:52:48] my season five most of my five star
[01:52:50] characters are c0 uh my writing is
[01:52:52] unrelatable C2 okay so don't get mad at
[01:52:54] me don't get mad at me don't get mad at
[01:52:57] me it just is what it is it is what it
[01:52:58] is okay I can't unactivate C2 it is what
[01:53:00] it is if I it is what it is okay it is
[01:53:02] what it is it is what it is it is what
[01:53:05] it is look look look look right in C2
[01:53:07] okay but like the isd0 c0 cosmo C1 Shout
[01:53:12] nilu
[01:53:20] so that we're gonna say it is what it is
[01:53:22] uh other characters uh I don't know what
[01:53:24] I just said
[01:53:26] she's already geared I love my Biddle I

[01:53:31] I always keep him geared watch this 500
[01:53:33] gifted says the Luke is geared

[01:53:40] is uh actually we'll just change our
[01:53:42] weapon
[01:53:46] 85 to 26. not bad

[01:56:52] he's geared and I won't bother looking
[01:56:53] at Tomah because he's geared look yep
[01:56:55] he's on full em though but it's fine
[01:56:58] wait I actually might not want em should

[01:57:31] really crispy takes the nine months
[01:57:35] yeah this should be enough HP it's fine
[01:57:38] we're not gonna die
[01:57:39] Ito has the level one weapon how the
[01:57:42] [ __ ] did you know oh cause
[01:57:45] now
[01:57:49] all right let's go
[01:57:56] all right we start with 11 30 to 12. I
[01:57:58] wish I just started with 12 [ __ ] eleven
[01:58:00] but it's fine we'll do 11 first uh
[01:58:02] Violet lighting that means we need to
[01:58:04] tell second half we need Venti
[01:58:08] oh my God
[01:58:17] wait is my hotel geared
[01:58:19] I kind of forgot I was playing Hotel
[01:58:22] okay cheers
[01:58:31] first half the Luke second off Ryden
[01:58:36] venti we have the double archon Synergy
[01:58:39] Gamba what was even Gamba
[01:58:43] if I zero death it I mean we could but I
[01:58:45] I keep in mind my toma's not on HP so
[01:58:48] these enemies look like they deal a lot
[01:58:50] of damage so we might actually die
[01:58:54] um
[01:58:56] foreign
[01:59:23] we put Beto here
[01:59:27] I kind of want to run saw you first half
[01:59:28] for the damage right because VV but I
[01:59:31] feel like we're like we're low-key we're
[01:59:33] at risk of dying oh but this guy kind of
[01:59:35] hurts but I'm not gonna die to him so I
[01:59:37] feel like we might die second half so
[01:59:39] second half should have the Healer you
[01:59:40] get me
[01:59:42] but we can also just crystallize Shield
[01:59:43] surely a crystal Shields enough for the
[01:59:44] hilly trolls yeah we'll just crystallize
[01:59:46] Shield that's fine
[01:59:48] or Tomo yeah we'll just play Tomah
[01:59:51] I'm sorry for Stuff
[01:59:56] whoa yeah all right 11 should be easy
[02:00:00] we're gonna send these teams
[02:00:03] if I die I'm an embarrassment
[02:00:08] burst damage
[02:00:11] oh wait there's a monolith okay we
[02:00:14] actually have to try
[02:00:15] I actually look
[02:00:18] um okay I kind of forgot there's a model
[02:00:20] at the protect so the model of my diet
[02:00:22] okay

[02:00:31] fine but I am not responsible for your
[02:00:33] title points okay you are consenting to
[02:00:35] the loss of Channel points even if I do
[02:00:38] the dumbest [ __ ] ever okay we're gonna
[02:00:40] do a one minute Gamba will he
[02:00:43] Nine Star zero death yes no lamao yes he
[02:00:48] amazing okay you can vote I I don't know
[02:00:52] I mean 11 should be easy like not to be
[02:00:54] cocky but I think 11 should be easy but

[02:00:59] like listen I am I listen if you lose
[02:01:02] your points that's not on me

[02:01:10] I'm saying no reset
[02:01:12] no death no reset
[02:01:14] if we die or reset we spin the wheel
[02:01:18] I want to make a coffee I might do that
[02:01:20] but before 12. I'm gonna go make a
[02:01:21] coffee
[02:01:26] there's all the photos guys
[02:01:31] reset is not a death yeah but like it's
[02:01:33] kind of cheating if every time I'm about
[02:01:34] to die resetting I mean
[02:01:36] already
[02:01:38] uh I'm gonna delucault and then saw you
[02:01:45] I did this to group them right I do this
[02:01:47] to group them then I swirl the Pyro bit
[02:01:50] old
[02:01:57] this is terrible this is atrocious wait
[02:02:01] this is not going to do they're shooting
[02:02:02] it I don't know they shot the monolith
[02:02:05] bro okay I Loki forgot there was a
[02:02:08] monarithm 11. maybe like in the intro we
[02:02:10] had dog floor 11 is also hard because
[02:02:13] there's a monolith there you go you're
[02:02:15] welcome editor
[02:02:20] no we actually got this
[02:02:24] oh no no
[02:02:27] no no
[02:02:28] instead
[02:02:29] bro what are they doing
[02:02:32] I don't have energy
[02:02:34] oh my God I forgot you need more energy
[02:02:36] on beta when you're playing a no [ __ ]
[02:02:38] character team and your team no don't
[02:02:40] shoot that slime there don't shoot that
[02:02:41] dun dun uh hey don't drop that dun dun
[02:02:46] I missed
[02:02:48] these guys

[02:03:29] if you're a believer in the chat I'm
[02:03:30] sorry I don't think we're nice we can
[02:03:33] reset okay look
[02:03:35] if we don't three start with reset
[02:03:37] because I think it's three starable I
[02:03:38] just didn't know what to expect
[02:03:40] but I think venti carries I actually
[02:03:41] think venti carries I just don't have a
[02:03:43] lot of ER on him but Ryden can ghost
[02:03:45] energy and Tomah has fav
[02:03:48] [Applause]
[02:03:56] re's kind of OB ready
[02:03:59] good damage well I didn't hit that guy
[02:04:00] in there
[02:04:06] brace yourself Let's Roll
[02:04:11] we're just we keep we keep him locked
[02:04:13] with venti so he doesn't touch them
[02:04:15] Olive
[02:04:16] illusion if I need to get his burst back
[02:04:18] though
[02:04:21] well on my burst
[02:04:25] no
[02:04:27] no stop stop please I think you can get
[02:04:30] away
[02:04:34] should we finish broken
[02:04:37] oh
[02:04:41] imagine not believing
[02:04:45] okay to be fair see two writing didn't
[02:04:46] matter because Fenty right in would have
[02:04:48] killed even if she had like no damage
[02:04:51] but yeah venti carried
[02:04:54] okay second half uh skill damage yeah
[02:04:57] sure what is this one
[02:04:59] for a second chamber I mean
[02:05:04] a swirl pyro black bro that was
[02:05:18] the name of the truth
[02:05:22] okay so far so good yeah
[02:05:26] yeah okay cool
[02:05:29] oh there's only one enemy okay this is
[02:05:32] fine
[02:05:37] I should probably record the [ __ ]
[02:05:40] dude the one thing I hate about
[02:05:41] streaming Abyss is like the bittery gets
[02:05:42] so [ __ ] I feel like I should record
[02:05:44] the like footage separately
[02:05:54] what is this this looks like venti

[02:26:20] yeah Iran is [ __ ] great
[02:26:24] my body okay my body is a lot more white
[02:26:26] than my spice tolerance I mean like
[02:26:29] what I mean about that is like I'll have
[02:26:30] like super spicy food and I'll like it
[02:26:32] but my also like my nose will start
[02:26:33] running and I'll start like dying but
[02:26:35] like I like it
[02:26:39] Mike
[02:26:41] and oh it's like this Japanese like this
[02:26:44] Ramen place and they're like ultimate
[02:26:45] spicy Ramen and they warned us like four
[02:26:47] times about it and it was good and like
[02:26:49] I was fine but I used like a full clean
[02:26:51] Xbox
[02:26:57] I'm not a masochist
[02:27:00] it's just good
[02:27:07] okay the only problem with this is
[02:27:10] how am I gonna talk for the rest of the
[02:27:12] video now
[02:27:30] okay I'm normal I'm back to normal
[02:27:35] okay
[02:27:36] we we now we now did 412
[02:28:05] we now did floor 11 time for floor 12.
[02:28:23] let's get it haha
[02:28:40] dude I'm dying
[02:28:42] like it wasn't even that bad but my body
[02:28:44] just can't
[02:28:57] dude I don't need to do a temple we only
[02:28:59] spin the wheel because I ate starred
[02:29:15] all right I'm good actually this is so
[02:29:16] much
[02:29:18] okay okay okay
[02:29:20] now 412 we're gonna randomize teams
[02:29:22] again they have to be doable and if
[02:29:24] they're doable we'll be fine new boom
[02:29:28] all right
[02:29:30] okay first four characters I'm okay stop
[02:29:33] it's just hard to start I'm okay first
[02:29:35] four characters
[02:29:43] this isn't as bad as it looks because
[02:29:45] the heat is broken and we have two
[02:29:46] healers it's not as bad as it looks
[02:29:49] Mika's useless but we have two healers a
[02:29:53] shield and a heat is broken so
[02:29:59] three Healers
[02:30:04] true
[02:30:06] I actually forgot what Mika's kit was
[02:30:10] four Healers
[02:30:12] because nahira prototype Amber I
[02:30:14] actually forgot what because like I knew
[02:30:16] he's a physical buffer I legit forgot
[02:30:18] his birth yield I actually forgot like I
[02:30:20] literally I cannot remember what he did
[02:30:22] okay yeah we have [ __ ] four uh three
[02:30:25] to three healers kind of four okay we're
[02:30:27] probably this probably is not gonna work
[02:30:29] but we'll try again it's fine that's one
[02:30:32] if we get
[02:30:34] if we get like
[02:30:36] hutau
[02:30:38] Beto it's winnable
[02:30:49] okay we could play ayato burgeon second
[02:30:52] half which is good
[02:30:54] unfortunately we don't have a first half
[02:30:59] okay this looks like a reroll yep it's
[02:31:02] like like a reroll let's do a quick
[02:31:03] little Temple let's do a quick little
[02:31:05] Temple chat which matter
[02:31:07] I want either kiraticons or a weapon
[02:31:11] either kironicons or a weapon
[02:31:13] what should we do
[02:31:16] Kirara our weapon people are saying you
[02:31:18] uh are saying so probably
[02:31:21] yukirara
[02:31:29] actually let's do a poll
[02:31:38] weapon
[02:31:40] what pull all right what should we pull
[02:31:43] on
[02:31:49] why are you chatting me
[02:31:52] damn if you want Kirara okay we can do
[02:31:54] kirano all right thumb
[02:31:59] all right for our reroll we do a temple
[02:32:00] for Quran let's do uh let's see yeah
[02:32:02] Miko I like imiko
[02:32:04] is cool
[02:32:06] nice okay we don't want a five star all
[02:32:08] we want is Kirara nothing else
[02:32:10] okay no five star is good
[02:32:15] okay
[02:32:17] you did I think I have her C6 but you
[02:32:20] know you did
[02:32:22] is that it
[02:32:25] okay that was oh wait I don't have a C6
[02:32:28] wait what I owned one
[02:32:30] wait what constellation am I using
[02:32:32] that's good that's actually good wait
[02:32:34] what constellations by hugeon
[02:32:39] oh that's C5 okay we actually need one
[02:32:40] more okay not bad we could actually get
[02:32:42] C6 engine then
[02:32:45] all right new teams
[02:32:47] let's pretend that didn't happen all
[02:32:49] right take two
[02:32:51] oh not bad
[02:32:53] okay Goro's useless but listen
[02:32:57] his C4 acts as healing and Layla is a
[02:33:00] shielder so that's enough then
[02:33:02] kokomi as a hydro healer I hide them as
[02:33:06] a DPS we actually have a good a good
[02:33:07] start actually good start
[02:33:15] no I'm rerolling the whole thing not
[02:33:16] just one like this is a whole new like
[02:33:18] set of eight
[02:33:20] because it's not it's not fair we'd go
[02:33:22] until we get a good four and then yeah
[02:33:24] all right take two
[02:33:26] we don't need any more healers to have
[02:33:28] this so hopefully we get like another
[02:33:29] good DPS and we're fine
[02:33:37] like look here's the thing with
[02:33:39] randomizers you don't want to randomize
[02:33:40] too much until it's easy and you don't
[02:33:42] want to do it it's impossible because
[02:33:43] it's not fun it's literally not even
[02:33:44] like like dude what is Mika Eloy
[02:34:02] all right maybe we'll get C6 Union or a
[02:34:06] uh Kirara constellation both of those
[02:34:08] would be good both of those would be
[02:34:10] great uh Kirara ideally let's see
[02:34:13] curiosity one
[02:34:15] okay oh
[02:34:18] okay nice we got curiosity one
[02:34:20] easy good tempo
[02:34:23] very nice okay no more rerolly no we're
[02:34:25] like this is gonna be the one
[02:34:28] boom
[02:34:30] stop giving me Mika stop I Mika of the
[02:34:34] Knights of fevonius
[02:34:36] look just because I sound like him
[02:34:38] doesn't mean I want him
[02:34:41] it's fine we have two healers we have
[02:34:43] Kazo uh Hazel who's good and official
[02:34:46] who's really good so it's it's doable
[02:34:50] it's probably not doable all right we'll
[02:34:53] do another team
[02:34:54] that doesn't count we got Hazel again
[02:35:02] wait this might be doable
[02:35:04] wait wait
[02:35:06] okay I mean
[02:35:09] it's gonna be hard we have no Bennett
[02:35:11] with shangling
[02:35:12] but it might be doable to Luke
[02:35:14] shanglink's second half
[02:35:18] well we might actually have a good team
[02:35:19] well uh
[02:35:21] Hazel a Nemo battery
[02:35:23] we have this going on
[02:35:27] then as they're kissing we have like a
[02:35:28] Healer with us triple Animo official to
[02:35:31] carry no we probably need to fish the
[02:35:32] second half
[02:35:33] no we don't wait do we what is the thing
[02:35:35] uh is a pyro thing cryo thing Hydro
[02:35:38] thing
[02:35:41] this
[02:35:43] and then we do double pyro double Hydro
[02:35:46] oh no but Mika's probably not a Feeling
[02:35:48] is he yeah surely he'll be
[02:35:56] dude we have reverse melt Quick's wall
[02:35:58] we actually have reverse melt quick swap
[02:36:03] and then first half we have Xiao
[02:36:06] wait this is actually winnable
[02:36:15] need a lot of power second yeah Luke has
[02:36:18] to be enough so we should actually be
[02:36:19] fine
[02:36:20] okay I like these teams
[02:36:24] like
[02:36:26] it's not like it's not like the best
[02:36:28] teams but it's it's doable and that's
[02:36:29] the point of a randomizer all right
[02:36:31] because we don't want to like keep
[02:36:33] randoming until it's easy right
[02:36:35] all right let me see let's just look at
[02:36:36] what our teams would look like let's
[02:36:37] look at what our teams would look like
[02:36:38] so it would be first half would be Xiao
[02:36:45] saw you
[02:36:49] Hazel who we could level up official
[02:36:52] then second half would be the Luke who's
[02:36:55] gonna carry us shangling
[02:36:59] shanha
[02:37:03] where is she shanha and then [ __ ]
[02:37:06] Mika
[02:37:09] wait are Mika's level eight armika's
[02:37:11] level 60.
[02:37:16] we're gonna have to level him
[02:37:19] honestly it's doable honestly it's
[02:37:22] doable
[02:37:29] you sure you can kill founder mattif
[02:37:31] yeah Luke
[02:37:36] they'll be fine
[02:37:41] it'll be fine
[02:37:46] we could also put Hazel second half we
[02:37:48] could also swirl pyro swirl cryo do some
[02:37:51] [ __ ] like that shenho is like not bad
[02:37:53] with ciao
[02:38:01] Oregon Mika first half
[02:38:06] but
[02:38:18] what is Mika gonna do he's just a Healer
[02:38:21] but like swirling pyro and swirling cry
[02:38:23] would be a lot better than Mika yeah I
[02:38:25] agree I think Sawyer is better here or
[02:38:27] Hazel but then we need a Healer yeah I
[02:38:29] think this is better
[02:38:35] yep yep yep and then Mika does nothing
[02:38:37] first off but he's a Healer
[02:38:44] it's a map of the Abyss true
[02:38:56] I think it's doable let's get really
[02:38:57] fast oh I didn't take a picture of the
[02:38:59] teams
[02:39:00] you guys want to watch my Ms paint
[02:39:01] skills look this is what I'm gonna
[02:39:02] recreate it
[02:39:04] um
[02:39:21] what's up
[02:39:24] all right we censored to Luke too that
[02:39:26] should be this is our team
[02:39:28] uh so Xiao official is gonna be like the
[02:39:30] primary damage dealing Hazel will be
[02:39:32] there just to be there and then Mika
[02:39:34] will be the healer
[02:39:36] and then second off to Luke shingling
[02:39:38] are gonna carry Sean her a bit of crowd
[02:39:40] damage passively in some Buffs and then
[02:39:41] sorry he's gonna swirl
[02:39:46] Hazel could be on 4V for artificial
[02:39:57] Honestly though since changlings playing
[02:39:59] a team with only I mean Deluxe kind of a
[02:40:01] pyro battery I guess so shangling should
[02:40:04] be fine but I was thinking of getting
[02:40:05] two um five lances one for shenha and
[02:40:09] one for like we only have one five Lance
[02:40:11] leveled I kind of want to level another
[02:40:13] can I
[02:40:15] no not wait maybe how do I check how
[02:40:17] many Blues I have whatever
[02:40:27] Hazel should be on thrilling Tales I
[02:40:29] think because we don't need more healing
[02:40:31] than Mika right surely
[02:40:34] surely we need damage to three star
[02:40:38] because VV goes a long way on either
[02:40:40] snapshot official or just ciao
[02:40:47] okay let's gear Mika so Mika does this
[02:40:51] healing scale on HP I've been [ __ ]
[02:40:52] played me code Forever
[02:40:57] oh my it's level one
[02:41:08] dude I have the level of my Mika just
[02:41:10] for this
[02:41:13] didn't know I only have to use Mika
[02:41:16] that's fine I like big guy I like bigger
[02:41:23] all right Chad we're gonna go do the
[02:41:25] worst domain in the game
[02:41:26] the monster domain oh no
[02:41:37] [Music]
[02:41:39] wait actually before we do the domain
[02:41:41] let me see what I need to level Vico
[02:41:49] I need wolf hooks are you [ __ ] me
[02:42:01] can we use any of his passives
[02:42:17] also the healing intervals every 2.5
[02:42:19] seconds so as long as they do a normal
[02:42:21] cancel on Xiao I should be healing right
[02:42:24] just like normal jump reel will be fine
[02:42:40] guys guys
[02:42:42] surely I don't have to farm for Mika
[02:42:50] oh my God I have to kill the [ __ ] we
[02:42:52] nut
[02:43:00] you know what it's fine we'll level our
[02:43:02] vehicle that's fine
[02:43:06] not worth it is worth content
[02:43:11] okay let me let me change an actual
[02:43:13] theme anything for content
[02:43:15] foreign
[02:43:26] 70 is fine but his healing skills on HP
[02:43:28] so surely it's not enough healing for
[02:43:31] two consecrated beasts
[02:43:34] you guys think I want to fight two
[02:43:36] consecrated beasts without a Healer
[02:43:41] are they game sounds loud why is it
[02:43:43] hurting my ears
[02:44:03] here you are
[02:44:11] isn't it a little four though for what
[02:44:16] oh wait I'm not resin
[02:44:27] foreign
[02:44:45] just got here we have to level our Mika
[02:44:47] for the randomizer that's what we're
[02:44:48] doing let me go get uh wolf hooks really
[02:44:50] fast I know we don't need to level 80
[02:44:53] him but I feel like we may as well agree
[02:45:01] I mean okay
[02:45:02] unless you go like we can go prototype
[02:45:05] Amber Hazel but I kind of want my Hazel
[02:45:07] to do damn it I guess he's not gonna do
[02:45:08] damage okay we could uh-huh but I want a
[02:45:11] thrilling Tails him
[02:45:18] I'm not re-rolling
[02:45:34] honestly we could probably do fine
[02:45:35] without leveling him too much we could
[02:45:37] just keep him like
[02:45:40] foreign
[02:46:23] facts
[02:46:28] before I decide let's let's test the
[02:46:30] healing before we decide do anything
[02:46:32] harsh Let's test
[02:46:34] so we'll just do like full HP let's just
[02:46:36] do like scale on HP [ __ ]
[02:46:39] yeah
[02:46:41] don't ask why that was on gun you
[02:46:50] I want healing bonus here
[02:47:04] okay
[02:47:07] what the [ __ ] is healing bonus
[02:47:15] I don't know why that shit's on Dale but
[02:47:17] all good
[02:47:21] okay let's see
[02:47:39] okay this is purely a test purely a test
[02:47:45] purely oh we have healing Effectiveness
[02:47:47] okay we're gonna take that I just want
[02:47:49] to test
[02:47:50] how much healing will do let me let them
[02:47:52] hit me
[02:47:53] would be better but it doesn't matter
[02:47:55] we're just trying to see how much we'll
[02:47:56] heal
[02:47:56] if we do go healing
[02:47:59] okay that's enough
[02:48:00] solidified now we all
[02:48:05] I mean it fully healed us
[02:48:10] wait let me let me strongly take damage
[02:48:12] dude it fully healed us we'll be fine
[02:48:17] dude we'll actually be fine okay let me
[02:48:20] let me jungle has more HP let's draw the
[02:48:22] tank
[02:48:32] yeah he just only heals every time he
[02:48:33] has his burst up but like it also heals
[02:48:35] through the normal attacks nothing but
[02:48:37] that's not very relevant on ciao
[02:48:40] we'll see we'll see we'll see look at
[02:48:42] that strongly go to like one HP
[02:48:44] I'll take some damage on shout out too
[02:48:55] okay Shield
[02:48:57] s let's keep going team okay shallows
[02:48:59] full HP no no let's see 2K all normal
[02:49:03] attacking everyone like 2.5 seconds yo
[02:49:05] this is fine
[02:49:07] and then Xiao can do normal attacks
[02:49:09] between the plunges okay we're off now
[02:49:11] no it didn't it didn't it's still there
[02:49:13] now it did and then we should be able to
[02:49:17] have it back
[02:49:18] yo this is fine it's fine it's actually
[02:49:22] fine we don't even need to level more
[02:49:23] that's fine
[02:49:25] actually fine
[02:49:26] granted Mika only generates like wait
[02:49:29] yeah it's fine
[02:49:33] okay is Mika gonna be your no blast user
[02:49:36] who else is in the team Hazel yeah okay
[02:49:37] Mika's gonna be on the bus so Mika
[02:49:42] change his weapon no no Fab is
[02:49:43] definitely the play
[02:49:49] and then we're gonna go forward a bless
[02:49:59] watch we're gonna clear it first try
[02:50:01] without re-rolling we'll go ER sanso
[02:50:04] yeah ah I mean
[02:50:07] shot what do you think
[02:50:09] surely I don't need the ass hands with
[02:50:11] uh like fav and Hazel and Fishel and
[02:50:16] Xiao three E's camera saying ER yeah
[02:50:18] we'll go here
[02:50:20] wdr stands some HP
[02:50:23] uh this one has flat HP
[02:50:28] yeah let's go ER
[02:50:32] maybe I'll just do offset er uh onset
[02:50:35] will do we'll do this
[02:50:38] or this Channel I want that
[02:50:40] Shan he yeah we'll go some crit rate
[02:50:42] boom flower Critter rate and er baby
[02:50:44] Critter in any R maybe that's on shanha
[02:50:47] but she's not gonna be on Fab so well
[02:50:48] you only kid
[02:50:49] flower I mean uh goblet
[02:50:53] HP with some Er
[02:50:55] circlet
[02:50:58] healing bonus to some Er
[02:51:01] and then says we'll go ER with some HP
[02:51:04] so filter by ER and then HP
[02:51:07] boom and now armiko
[02:51:11] 236 ER on a favonius lance
[02:51:15] um you know the Healer should be fine
[02:51:19] should I get them to 80. I think it's
[02:51:21] fine right I think we'll be fine
[02:51:26] I think you'll be fine right
[02:51:31] yeah it'll be fine
[02:51:34] okay other characters we have shout out
[02:51:36] now I'm gonna be honest
[02:51:37] I don't like my Vermillion as much as my
[02:51:40] two piece two piece it's probably better
[02:51:42] but we'll just stay Vermillion I guess
[02:51:46] yeah it's definitely better we'll just
[02:51:48] leave a million how much yard do I have
[02:51:50] 117.
[02:52:04] I'm gonna go for a bit more ER I'd
[02:52:05] rather be safe we're gonna go a bit more
[02:52:07] yarn or shallow so it looks like this
[02:52:09] 127.9
[02:52:11] wait but
[02:52:13] is there only animal character Hazel are
[02:52:14] you playing sadio oh no or not it's only
[02:52:16] Hazel
[02:52:19] that should be fine
[02:52:27] okay official
[02:52:35] wait what the [ __ ] oh we're on the wrong
[02:52:37] circuit
[02:52:40] two piece two piece uh we probably don't
[02:52:42] want stringless if we're not aggravating
[02:52:45] so we're gonna give our official Skyward
[02:52:47] harp
[02:52:50] and then our crit damage circlet
[02:52:57] I'm glad you came
[02:53:00] up
[02:53:04] 74 200 official
[02:53:07] easy
[02:53:09] but we don't need ER on her anymore
[02:53:17] so we could do this
[02:53:20] I don't like 199.8 it looks ugly but
[02:53:22] 81.9.8
[02:53:26] can't wait for this to be a video in 7.4
[02:53:28] listen the upload will be faster this
[02:53:30] time okay
[02:53:31] we might need a bit of er unofficial
[02:53:33] Loki I know usually you don't but our
[02:53:35] team comp like
[02:53:39] why are you guys laughing at that that
[02:53:40] wasn't funny okay remember the yard now
[02:53:43] that wasn't funny it wasn't funny
[02:53:49] it was not funny okay anyways last
[02:53:52] character in this team is Hazel
[02:53:56] uh what the [ __ ] are we doing the Hazel
[02:53:58] chat I kind of want to throw in Tails
[02:53:59] but I know you guys will be mad if I
[02:54:00] don't play him as a DPS I could play him
[02:54:03] second half
[02:54:04] as like the driver but then our Delux
[02:54:06] not gonna play so I kind of want to play
[02:54:08] him like throwing tails
[02:54:12] look I love Hazel okay but like
[02:54:23] oh yeah he's level 70.
[02:54:27] um why did I neglect them what happened
[02:54:28] did Zach's changed that is obviously oh
[02:54:31] it's all coming out now
[02:54:33] seems to be a Hazel and dryer
[02:54:37] prototype Amber you will die I won't die
[02:54:40] we'll be fine with Red Tails and then
[02:54:42] we'll go for vivita swirl for official
[02:54:50] all right 4V
[02:54:53] do we need any stats on him what what
[02:54:56] like what are we even going for what
[02:54:57] stats are we going for it doesn't even
[02:55:00] matter we could just go crit I guess but
[02:55:01] like
[02:55:06] [Music]
[02:55:17] I'm glad you boom boom boom boom boom
[02:55:21] boom boom boom boom
[02:55:27] we're staying attack goblet [ __ ] it
[02:55:37] okay that's team one done team two
[02:55:39] we have the Luke shangling say you
[02:55:43] shanha we'll start with Shanghai
[02:55:45] shanna's gonna be on foreign
[02:55:57] and then we do cruiserwitch probably
[02:55:59] doesn't do [ __ ] because we're not we're
[02:56:01] not procking reactions so we probably do
[02:56:02] like
[02:56:03] two two or some [ __ ]
[02:56:05] no it's still good four is still good
[02:56:07] because because of the way it works
[02:56:14] all right no bless
[02:56:28] ER is good attack is good we would
[02:56:31] probably want an ER Sans
[02:56:34] yeah that sounds fine rip Bennett all
[02:56:36] good though and then we want probably
[02:56:38] attack goblet I don't have one on set
[02:56:41] for some reason okay
[02:56:43] circuit gold flower we want some attack
[02:56:45] or ER
[02:56:47] that's fine
[02:56:50] and tackle it
[02:56:52] 200 ER
[02:56:54] 2.9 K attack vortex
[02:56:58] gonna send her but I'm broke so we won't
[02:57:04] oh yeah wait quilt you're right wait
[02:57:07] actually maybe we don't need to go
[02:57:09] attack wait wait
[02:57:12] because the Quill's Killer attack was
[02:57:13] only for cryo damage
[02:57:18] oh wait you're right maybe we do go cryo
[02:57:21] crit
[02:57:22] that's a good point
[02:57:29] dumb
[02:57:36] low Q we might hold e for the first time
[02:57:38] ever this might be the first time I hold
[02:57:40] skill on far on [ __ ] shadow
[02:57:43] I might actually hold skill on channel
[02:57:45] for the first time
[02:57:49] okay
[02:57:50] so we're gonna go on [ __ ] crit build
[02:57:53] I forgot about that good good take good
[02:57:56] take okay let's let's try again
[02:58:00] uh where's the blast here it should be
[02:58:02] at the bottom there it is is do I have a
[02:58:04] crowd goblet
[02:58:05] I do
[02:58:09] this is good
[02:58:13] this is good
[02:58:15] uh I don't have a good flower anymore
[02:58:17] because we threw it away last video but
[02:58:19] we should have a good feather offset
[02:58:20] we'll do I want a feather has some Er
[02:58:25] I like that
[02:58:28] and then we'll go like uh yades there
[02:58:30] we'll go like
[02:58:32] uh almost going on shangling probably
[02:58:39] going golfing
[02:58:47] through a feather way that's what I
[02:58:48] meant to say I don't know what I said
[02:58:53] I just want a bit more career damage
[02:58:55] um
[02:58:56] how do I get marker damage
[02:59:03] do this but then I lose
[02:59:06] a lot of crit rate which probably isn't
[02:59:08] worth it but we do get some Er
[02:59:11] R it's fine
[02:59:13] all right cool almost done now we just
[02:59:16] have Chang Ling and the Luke but Luke's
[02:59:18] basically done because
[02:59:20] we got power damage from the four piece
[02:59:22] so it's still good just em becomes less
[02:59:24] useful so we'll do that uh [ __ ] yeah
[02:59:27] we'll go this
[02:59:30] that's good
[02:59:32] [ __ ] em will go
[02:59:37] where's my power got there it is Boom
[02:59:42] 99 holy [ __ ] wait
[02:59:46] that's just like 99 245.
[02:59:51] can also go wolves though you can also
[02:59:53] go wolves
[02:59:57] um
[03:00:02] and then crit damage circuit
[03:00:07] Miss 71.96 I
[03:00:10] won power residents will give us attack
[03:00:11] two and it looks funnier so we're gonna
[03:00:13] do the other one oh but Will's Grace on
[03:00:15] procking this proc second half yeah it
[03:00:17] procs on the no it doesn't no it doesn't
[03:00:20] no it doesn't okay [ __ ] wolves
[03:00:23] this looks better bigger number better
[03:00:25] person
[03:00:27] honestly serpent spine is probably the
[03:00:29] best if wolves doesn't proc
[03:00:32] but ah we don't have Bennett though uh
[03:00:39] I'll just do wolves
[03:00:44] all right let's start the Luke
[03:00:47] and then lastly shangling oppa cash
[03:00:50] we're the only problem with the
[03:00:51] Strangling is we're on uh a lot of em I
[03:00:54] thought it was yam Sands but I guess
[03:00:55] just wait what the [ __ ]
[03:00:57] oh no we're not 44 never mind I thought
[03:00:59] we were in the m stands I guess I took
[03:01:00] it off okay we're fine
[03:01:02] uh this is probably just a good build
[03:01:04] then we probably don't need to look much
[03:01:05] into it
[03:01:10] yeah this is fine I don't know the the
[03:01:12] Luke shangling ER requirements I'm gonna
[03:01:14] be honest
[03:01:15] uh
[03:01:17] um I'm gonna be honest so maybe we got
[03:01:19] er
[03:01:20] like Sans
[03:01:24] because I haven't played the Luke
[03:01:26] changling
[03:01:31] 300 Omega LOL dude ah Maybe
[03:01:38] no there's no way the Luke actually
[03:01:39] generates decent ER I mean decent pyro
[03:01:42] particles on fields
[03:01:46] so this should be fine
[03:01:50] are could damage is a bit low
[03:01:53] but surely cash is better here
[03:01:56] I mean what if we went homo
[03:02:01] with nothing in between
[03:02:04] there's surely 180 is fine and then we
[03:02:07] go falshan huh
[03:02:13] I mean I think home is better but we
[03:02:16] need more ER
[03:02:21] 200 oh
[03:02:28] and then we go Fab saw you
[03:02:32] Fab saw you in this team
[03:02:35] sorry for the gearing shot we're gonna
[03:02:36] start in a second we go fast saw you
[03:02:38] [ __ ] the sack we got five great sword
[03:02:43] it is what it is we don't care about
[03:02:44] base attack on her boom and then 4V boom
[03:02:47] and then we stack ER
[03:02:53] Story of My Life
[03:02:56] sorry
[03:03:00] um
[03:03:01] yeah
[03:03:06] we also need crit rate though for Fab to
[03:03:08] work
[03:03:11] like that
[03:03:15] 30 crude rate 185 ER full em
[03:03:26] yeah you're right though we have no base
[03:03:28] stock
[03:03:30] but it doesn't matter because we're
[03:03:31] going full yeah and we're not going
[03:03:32] attack but I mean
[03:03:34] because we have this thing uh where is
[03:03:36] it this thing
[03:03:44] fine right surely
[03:03:47] surely
[03:03:52] wait what if it went makhyra
[03:03:55] no
[03:03:59] sock would be more healing
[03:04:02] is
[03:04:03] 66 that's why we're going fully I'm 66.
[03:04:06] granted base attack would still help
[03:04:09] but I think it is what it is but yeah
[03:04:11] she is C6
[03:04:31] wait this is better
[03:04:37] laughs
[03:04:40] okay I think we're good shanna's geared
[03:04:42] to lose geared size geared
[03:04:44] I think everyone's geared nice all right
[03:04:51] ready shot
[03:04:53] do we think we have enough ER on sayu
[03:04:55] surely right
[03:05:00] right let me look up Scio ERX say you ER
[03:05:05] string mains

[03:06:07] dude our em is so low
[03:06:11] we are not gonna heal okay we're ready
[03:06:13] we're ready but before we we're done but
[03:06:16] before we start let's just test our saw
[03:06:17] you healing
[03:06:18] what
[03:06:22] happened
[03:06:23] like to be fair if someone told me what
[03:06:25] Yara would need for saying that team off
[03:06:27] field I would probably say over 200 but
[03:06:29] I don't know the actual amount it's just
[03:06:31] like a safe guess
[03:06:34] okay so let me like let's test Quick
[03:06:36] Test Quick Test
[03:06:38] where saw you
[03:06:42] balls
[03:06:45] imagine all this gearing just to reroll
[03:06:47] okay quick test for healing
[03:06:52] we have to take as much damage as you
[03:06:53] can
[03:06:54] if you want to take David just play
[03:06:56] normally zionics
[03:06:58] wait how'd that Dodge the [ __ ]
[03:07:09] you said it not me okay but you weren't
[03:07:11] thinking it because it's not true
[03:07:14] careless
[03:07:17] yeah there should be enough to test okay
[03:07:20] gather we'll do e
[03:07:26] h
[03:07:28] honestly but we're not gonna be shielded
[03:07:30] so it won't heal like like we might take
[03:07:32] damage while we're healing but
[03:07:34] 4K ticks not bad and then saw you should
[03:07:37] have reverse back soon
[03:07:39] yeah okay that's fine
[03:07:44] yep
[03:07:45] should be fine

[03:08:27] I don't think I have one on VV
[03:08:30] maybe it's worth it but you know
[03:08:49] what is this playlist I don't know
[03:08:58] maybe I should have re-rolled but

[03:11:01] [ __ ] the Luke and Shang Ling will
[03:11:03] never be able to melt anything
[03:11:09] I guess it doesn't matter
[03:11:11] because there's a lot of Shields and
[03:11:13] then there's like Thunderman if and then
[03:11:14] there's this guy so I guess it doesn't

[03:11:53] video now boom in floor 12
[03:11:56] uh we'll take

[03:12:23] you invested a lot in ER oh that is true
[03:12:25] actually
[03:12:27] but
[03:12:30] like I feel like Xiao has enough ER and
[03:12:32] Mika probably does I just don't know
[03:12:33] what the uh maybe not all right let's go

[04:41:21] so hopefully we just need a five star I
[04:41:22] think our closest thing to pity is yai
[04:41:24] Banner if we missed the 50 50 it's good
[04:41:27] to build pity so it's a good win-win uh
[04:41:30] standard better would be Dom Wipeout
[04:41:31] okay well foreign
[04:41:37] twice that's actually whale status so
[04:41:39] okay there's one pool we got nothing no

[04:48:01] the pirate Shield like this thing would
[04:48:02] have been so good if we just had a bit
[04:48:04] more for the oh we just had a bit more
[04:48:06] for the power Shield
[04:48:11] hey swirl Pyro we got the Wolves

[04:49:13] him
[04:49:14] we'll still get one star fine six stars

[04:49:39] please dude die
[04:49:44] I mean listen that was just so good
[04:49:48] that was stuck at six stars six stars
[04:49:50] out of nine we get every Primo gem
[04:49:52] except 50 honestly
[04:49:55] for our randomized team it was fine the
[04:49:58] only problem was that we didn't have
[04:50:00] enough element to beat the pirate Shield
[04:50:03] our first half was really good our 12 1
[04:50:04] and 12 two were good but we had nothing
[04:50:06] to break the power shield and I don't
[04:50:08] want to reroll
[04:50:09] with that said we died so I do want you
[04:50:11] guys to spin technically I'll be like
[04:50:12] three but we're gonna do one because I
[04:50:14] said I'd do one
[04:50:16] just anything but the artifact Elite and
[04:50:18] we're happy

[04:50:30] guys more than now I dude
[04:50:33] okay it has to be listen listen
[04:50:44] we're gonna randomize a random set and
[04:50:47] then we're gonna randomize a random
[04:50:48] artifact from a random set and then
[04:50:49] we'll delete whatever that plus 20
[04:50:51] artifact is it's gonna be fully random
[04:50:53] and I won't scam I'll do it however
[04:51:01] if it's like 45 crit value if it's like
[04:51:04] a god piece I'm not gonna ruin my
[04:51:06] account I I listen I'm sorry I was if
[04:51:10] it's like like if it's really good I'll
[04:51:11] do it but if it's like amazing like 50
[04:51:14] crit value maybe not
[04:51:17] random

[04:52:26] I kept is like amazing so I don't want
[04:52:28] to throw any of these
[04:52:32] I mean this one's kind of coping I guess
[04:52:33] some of them are kind of mid some are
[04:52:35] really good like this one
[04:52:39] the only one I wouldn't want to throw no
[04:52:41] matter what is child is the Goblet but
[04:52:45] anything else I'd be open to but like
[04:52:48] they're really good like look at this
[04:52:49] dude look at this flower where is it
[04:52:50] look at how good this [ __ ] flower is

[04:53:24] add it to the pool
[04:53:28] this is a union gauntlet
[04:53:31] actually five Union Goblin ah well there
[04:53:35] you go okay let's just see what we would
[04:53:37] get so it's one to how many rows how
[04:53:39] many per row it's three six eight eight
[04:53:41] per row eight times three that's uh 24
[04:53:45] plus
[04:53:46] basically eight times four which is 32
[04:53:48] minus 131 right
[04:53:51] wait did I say 24 am I stupid
[04:53:54] it is
[04:53:57] wait yeah two times two would be 24 but
[04:53:59] what was I thinking wait did I [ __ ] no
[04:54:00] no eight times four yeah yeah we're fine
[04:54:02] okay so 32. all right randomize I don't
[04:54:03] know what I was saying
[04:54:05] what others do
[04:54:09] go 31 31.
[04:54:11] 31
[04:54:14] wait what number do we not want to get
[04:54:16] actually it's fine we'll count when we
[04:54:17] get it one two three one let's go
[04:54:19] nine okay that's not Charles goblet at
[04:54:21] least it's not shouts goblet so it's
[04:54:23] eight per row right eight for a row that
[04:54:25] means it's this feather all right ready
[04:54:30] I mean
[04:54:32] this it's good it's good
[04:54:37] but

[04:54:44] oh like it's a really good five piece
[04:54:50] it's not bad but it's it's it's
[04:54:54] it could have been a lot worse because
[04:54:55] like we have way worse so it's fine
[04:54:58] we'll throw it but I want to use the XP
[04:55:00] wisely I don't want to just throw it
[04:55:01] into a random piece
[04:55:04] foreign

[04:55:14] characters especially with the ER and HP
[04:55:16] or Em which are good for fav so it's
[04:55:18] like it's better than it looks

[05:12:12] female MC weird Coomer okay first of all
[05:12:15] picking the girl MC doesn't make you a
[05:12:17] Coomer second of all I think the male
[05:12:19] looks a bit more NPC in this game than
[05:12:20] usual third of all chat decided not me
[05:12:23] it was literally a poll it was literally
[05:12:25] a poll and chat chose
[05:12:34] anyways I've been playing offstream but
[05:12:36] I haven't played on stream for like
[05:12:37] literally over a week and you guys don't
[05:12:41] understand how okay I swear I know this
[05:12:44] for any gen viewer you don't believe me
[05:12:46] but I haven't Relic farmed off stream I
[05:12:48] did like maybe two or three like I did a
[05:12:50] little bit but you don't understand how
[05:12:52] much I pre-farmed you literally don't
[05:12:54] understand how much I pre-farmed
[05:12:56] look look look look wait actually let me
[05:13:00] show you

[05:13:41] gearing every character I want it's not
[05:13:42] just one okay let's look at the stagnant
[05:13:44] Shadows
[05:13:45] 89 quantum 89 41 gusts
[05:13:51] four
[05:13:53] I don't care about that
[05:13:56] 40 for my yanjing
[05:13:58] 37 for my genuine so it's like we've
[05:14:01] been this is what I prioritize obviously
[05:14:02] we still need traces to do because
[05:14:04] traces are [ __ ] stupid but everything
[05:14:05] dude you know if you guys think that's
[05:14:07] very little this is a week of more than
[05:14:10] a week of stamina literally just dumped
[05:14:12] into [ __ ] nothing but this okay we
[05:14:15] just have to do a lot of these like a
[05:14:16] lot of our stamina went into this [ __ ]
[05:14:17] like the the characters obviously traces
[05:14:20] are a scam and we should do more but
[05:14:22] it's a start okay it's a start it's a
[05:14:24] start I'll do more hot ones off stream
[05:14:25] but also like some of the traces things
[05:14:28] is like I leveled like I leveled some
[05:14:32] traces I didn't like keep them all like
[05:14:34] I leveled some of them off stream you
[05:14:36] know we still have a lot to level though
[05:14:38] wait what is this emote what the [ __ ] is
[05:14:39] oh gay who it's a global emotes
[05:14:44] wait it's global
[05:14:48] all right okay
[05:14:52] all right oh
[05:15:01] so yeah
[05:15:02] that's what we pre-farmed you know
[05:15:04] no you're not bad not bad honestly no
[05:15:07] not amazing but not bad
[05:15:10] um and we still have to do I still have
[05:15:12] to do memory of chaos I was thinking of
[05:15:13] doing that right now
[05:15:15] oh after the universe before the week
[05:15:17] you said it's true wait did I stream
[05:15:19] civilian Universe at all let me see but
[05:15:22] anyways my point was I want to do memory
[05:15:24] of chaos I want to like fully clear or
[05:15:26] clear as much as I can
[05:15:27] but at this point I might as well wait
[05:15:29] till silver wolf
[05:15:30] because then I could bring silver wolf
[05:15:32] there and clear with her so I don't know
[05:15:36] oh yeah [ __ ]
[05:15:39] yeah we didn't finish it
[05:15:42] should try start with this I kind of
[05:15:43] didn't want to start with it but I guess
[05:15:45] I could
[05:15:46] what's the world I need to clear this is
[05:15:48] really good for her so we could do this
[05:15:52] all right we'll do four three

[05:18:33] was just saying like you need specific
[05:18:34] ones to make it work which is true but
[05:18:36] also like there's so many of them and
[05:18:38] there's a lot of like it doesn't matter

[05:36:30] oh I did
[05:36:31] okay let's send six we'll do five after
[05:36:33] let's just pull ten six I could also do
[05:36:35] five off series reception because all we
[05:36:37] need is hit rate
[05:36:43] enemies yeah so sad sometimes every time
[05:36:49] chat Steely or Genuine who do you want
[05:36:51] to see
[05:36:52] one for ceiling two Virginia men three
[05:36:54] four balls
[05:36:59] both I mean I guess we could do both
[05:37:01] I've been saying two okay I mean we
[05:37:03] could do both on ironically it's just
[05:37:05] the skill point efficiency of that
[05:37:06] team's kind of weird
[05:37:07] like because then you have to run like
[05:37:10] yeah like this or you could do like
[05:37:13] bronia but then it's like
[05:37:20] because he's gonna [ __ ] you up nah we
[05:37:22] [ __ ] up cocoyo
[05:37:24] let me just Ascend you in because I
[05:37:26] actually like him
[05:37:27] so I don't mind assunning him he's also
[05:37:29] he's hot I also like the voice actor and
[05:37:31] people say I look like him
[05:37:33] yeah someone came up to me like in real
[05:37:36] life I was like dude what the [ __ ] like
[05:37:38] are you that guy from Hawkeye sorrow I
[05:37:41] was like who like well they're like no
[05:37:42] Jing Yuen I'm like really yeah yeah
[05:37:54] Ting Yoon is more skill point efficient
[05:37:56] than bronia but usually assuming you're
[05:37:58] Skilling on Rania but like
[05:38:00] I didn't level him I'm stupid
[05:38:07] um
[05:38:15] but you only buff one character
[05:38:21] yo yo
[05:38:24] wait I actually I can only hear from one
[05:38:26] ear what did he do
[05:38:34] okay it's fine
[05:38:35] okay what happened
[05:38:40] was there an accident
[05:38:42] okay that it's fine
[05:38:46] uh I know this
[05:38:53] bro is built like Arlen
[05:38:57] okay no I'm not
[05:39:03] I'm not built like Arlen
[05:39:07] oh [ __ ] I should level this
[05:39:09] I didn't see this oh [ __ ] whatever it's
[05:39:11] fine
[05:39:15] It's Magic you're not even built though
[05:39:17] no wait why is that on two piece what
[05:39:19] the [ __ ]
[05:39:21] what did I get off here I got this
[05:39:24] which could be good uh but it's speed
[05:39:26] it's not attack but it could be good
[05:39:28] uh for just Quantum characters in
[05:39:30] general and it has hit rate so hey if
[05:39:33] we're playing [ __ ] uh what's her name
[05:39:35] silver wolf and we don't want to go the
[05:39:38] [ __ ] musketeer set for Speed we could
[05:39:39] go this
[05:39:45] yeah that's a good thing
[05:39:51] anything oh we can get another thing too
[05:39:53] anything's fine all right
[05:39:55] I already got what I want can you just
[05:39:57] get another of anything
[05:40:01] all right wait one second shot
[05:40:30] all right sorry I'm back I was just
[05:40:31] checking something
[05:40:33] is bro gearing again no we're leveling
[05:40:35] our Relic
[05:40:38] okay I didn't Farm too many I guess I do
[05:40:40] have a lot of XP but I didn't do too
[05:40:41] many relics I'll stream I mostly did
[05:40:42] like pre-firming stuff so we don't have
[05:40:44] that much xp oh we got attack
[05:40:46] wait
[05:40:48] but it rolled attack ew
[05:40:52] still though
[05:40:54] that's like the best sub stats literally
[05:40:56] the best substance the attack rule was
[05:40:57] unfortunate but
[05:40:58] literally the best substance
[05:41:01] um
[05:41:02] wait what the [ __ ] is this piece
[05:41:10] plus 50 in this could hit rate is cringe
[05:41:13] but final but hitrid is optimal for uh
[05:41:16] what's her name
[05:41:17] silver wolf so if we use it could be a
[05:41:19] silver wolf piece
[05:41:27] from understanding speed is better for
[05:41:29] most characters but for certain carries
[05:41:30] or characters that have a lot of speed
[05:41:32] already like Celie who has like a
[05:41:33] million turns attack is better
[05:41:36] so I wouldn't use this on silly I don't
[05:41:37] think
[05:41:38] uh attack should be better but for a
[05:41:40] silver wolf I'd use it
[05:41:43] I want a plus 15 this it might be a
[05:41:45] waste because we don't have a lot of XP
[05:41:47] but I really want to
[05:41:50] press send it
[05:42:02] what is hit rate it's the rate of hit
[05:42:07] so for debuffing characters like noility
[05:42:09] characters that like reduce defense like
[05:42:10] asked or some [ __ ] uh hit rate like like
[05:42:13] the chance that they reduce the fans are
[05:42:14] like freeze or whatever is like
[05:42:17] enemies can resist it so the higher
[05:42:19] chance the higher the chance
[05:42:22] oh wait these are good boots we got one
[05:42:24] attack roll and then the rest crit
[05:42:26] nice very good
[05:42:28] very good
[05:42:31] oh those are like insane okay my genuine
[05:42:33] still sucks balls though so uh that has
[05:42:36] to change
[05:42:38] um
[05:42:39] okay we could do two piece
[05:42:45] I could just go main stats I guess but
[05:42:49] yeah he definitely sucks
[05:42:51] in terms of like stats that should be
[05:42:54] fine though
[05:42:56] we do like this
[05:42:58] and then
[05:42:59] love boots I could do four star boots I
[05:43:02] guess like this
[05:43:08] all right let's just do this
[05:43:19] I can also yeah I can also give them
[05:43:21] these as substance actually yeah that's
[05:43:22] probably better you're right yeah let's
[05:43:24] just do this we'll do this and then
[05:43:27] these boots are for like sub stats and
[05:43:29] then like yeah we're missing a two-piece
[05:43:30] but our commercial is fine for a no crit
[05:43:33] weapon it's like fine
[05:43:35] oh cage an okay start ideally we have a
[05:43:38] bit more crit damage but
[05:43:39] fine
[05:43:41] our ball is okay I guess that's why it
[05:43:43] sucks our ball is [ __ ] useless
[05:43:45] like our [ __ ] dude our lightning ball
[05:43:47] and our our lightning ball and our
[05:43:51] Quantum ball are our worst ones by far
[05:43:53] like look look at our ice one ice one's
[05:43:55] really good [ __ ]
[05:43:57] Quantum sucks wind was really good guess
[05:44:00] what I have another one I have another
[05:44:01] ice one I have another wind one but then
[05:44:03] our [ __ ] lightning and Quantum sucks
[05:44:05] though okay
[05:44:07] can this guy mute himself while gearing
[05:44:09] what do you mean why would you say that
[05:44:11] try level her so she doesn't die
[05:44:13] wait that's like no HP I thought I'd get
[05:44:15] more okay that's fine we're not gonna
[05:44:16] die
[05:44:18] surely We're Not Gonna Die right
[05:44:19] surely We're Not Gonna Die
[05:44:32] uh We're not gonna play I think we're
[05:44:34] gonna play Asta
[05:44:36] okay remind me to change asses like when
[05:44:37] we get to [ __ ] bronya because I think
[05:44:39] all these awesome brania
[05:44:43] oh no not brownie what's your name
[05:44:44] [ __ ] the the kokolia what's your name
[05:44:48] g-u-n bronio
[05:44:53] continuing

[05:45:07] centilitation
[05:45:15] get our weeklies from this then do our
[05:45:17] weekly bosses
[05:45:19] and then yeah we're chilling maybe they
[05:45:21] do the event too curio give me the
[05:45:23] gamble no we didn't get gamma this is
[05:45:25] good though what about this
[05:45:26] this could actually be good too
[05:45:40] enough for this though more money
[05:45:43] yeah let's go money disc is pretty good
[05:45:46] though
[05:45:49] [ __ ] I wanted the all right
[05:45:52] I don't know how that worked
[05:45:55] I'm probably out about this
[05:46:05] show no mercy
[05:46:11] yeah we're trying a genuine run
[05:46:12] realistically silly hunt would be better
[05:46:14] or something silly just to like but I
[05:46:17] don't know I come on Pitch again
[05:46:19] uh I these I mean this is fine

[06:05:12] favorite DPS I love yanjing I'm not a
[06:05:15] generic silly user although I like silly

[06:05:20] just saying I'm just saying we do what
[06:05:24] we gotta do Auto Battle yeah Ching is
[06:05:26] like it's like trying to Auto Battle
[06:05:29] yanching is like
[06:05:31] it's like trying to like
[06:05:34] it's like trying to tie your shoelaces
[06:05:37] but with one hand like you can do it but

[06:05:58] crush them the only analogy I can think
[06:06:02] of is the brushing your teeth with your
[06:06:03] finger analogy I can't think of any
[06:06:05] others
[06:06:07] [Music]
[06:06:09] like brushing your teeth with your
[06:06:10] finger you put toothpaste on it cause
[06:06:12] you don't have a toothbrush like
[06:06:13] thinking it'll work it kind of works but
[06:06:15] it doesn't work well so it's like what
[06:06:16] else can you do it's better than nothing
[06:06:17] but it's worse than something true
[06:06:20] while Alex you're truly a Wordsmith
