[00:11:17] I'm not exaggerating but what was and I
[00:11:20] got out it was fine but what's [ __ ] up
[00:11:21] is after I saved the 30 kittens I heard
[00:11:24] a toddler crying you know me I'm like
[00:11:26] welcome kids but I was like you know
[00:11:28] what I'm not gonna let a baby like you

[00:11:38] engulfed and I ran it put my hands in
[00:11:41] the fire grabbed the toddler ran taller
[00:11:44] unscratched because of my per my my like

[00:20:58] voice actor as child in Japanese so I
[00:21:00] like what I gave you
[00:21:02] um
[00:21:03] let me put these back
[00:21:07] yeah I also made a global [ __ ] tag
[00:21:09] for our past so I had this on me the
[00:21:10] whole time it was actually sick and I
[00:21:12] got a Senora rebozo but also wait why
[00:21:15] isn't it
[00:21:17] okay let me [ __ ] put everything away
[00:21:22] but yeah like literally everything I saw
[00:21:24] was so [ __ ] sick
[00:21:26] so I'm very happy
[00:21:31] I would show more but I could just zoom
[00:21:33] into the picture of anything also
[00:21:34] someone give me a long pochita
[00:21:39] oh and Emmy gave me a Red Chow look at
[00:21:42] this
[00:21:44] shallowed red I don't know why but it's
[00:21:46] cool
[00:21:47] also I'll hide them
[00:21:49] anyways so we got all that
[00:21:53] um which is very very cool so I tried
[00:21:55] almond tofu and it was in fact not the
[00:21:58] best dish I got a [ __ ] ton of prints I
[00:22:00] try to only get the ones of hot men like
[00:22:03] in in the straightest way possible just
[00:22:05] because I think they're cool
[00:22:06] um
[00:22:07] but
[00:22:09] you know things happen so we ended up
[00:22:11] getting more than just that uh but we
[00:22:13] got an actual [ __ ] ton
[00:22:15] uh I'm not gonna show everything but I
[00:22:18] will show some
[00:22:23] for example
[00:22:28] look at this [ __ ] blade

[00:22:57] um Kafka was a misprint so this is from
[00:23:00] one of Feng's friends
[00:23:01] and Kafka usually like it was a print of
[00:23:04] her whole body but this is a misprint
[00:23:06] that they weren't selling because it

[00:28:01] of this one
[00:28:02] how much was it in total I don't know I
[00:28:04] legit lost track of what the [ __ ] I was
[00:28:06] buying because okay dude oh wait there's
[00:28:09] a shout wait wait wait there's a nice
[00:28:10] shot one okay I don't show my conco one
[00:28:11] sec there's a nice wait you can still
[00:28:13] see it
[00:28:16] there's a nice shower one I don't know
[00:28:18] where it is though
[00:28:22] there's another wait I know I have
[00:28:24] another shot one oh it's here
[00:28:27] dude okay I was like I was like okay
[00:28:30] because I was like yo I gotta monitor my
[00:28:32] purchases right so standing in front of
[00:28:33] a booth I was like kind of quietly but I
[00:28:36] said like yo this is like sick I kind of
[00:28:37] want it I was debating getting it but I
[00:28:39] was like I'll come back later so then it
[00:28:40] was like this okay it was this shower I
[00:28:42] was like yo this is [ __ ] sick and
[00:28:44] then I was like okay I'll go back to it
[00:28:45] later right because I want to be a bit
[00:28:46] responsible and I want to wait a second
[00:28:48] so I walked away and then to the next
[00:28:51] booth and then I was gonna go back but
[00:28:53] then the artist who made this literally
[00:28:55] ran up to me handed it to me was like I
[00:28:58] loved your Toma video please take this
[00:29:00] they were like super shy it was kind of
[00:29:02] cute and then they ran away and then I
[00:29:04] went back and they wouldn't let me pay
[00:29:05] for it so I bought other [ __ ] which was
[00:29:07] also great but they literally would not
[00:29:09] let me pay for it so anyways but it's
[00:29:10] very cool there's a tear in his eye so
[00:29:13] this is also going on my wall
[00:29:15] um and I think that's everything
[00:29:18] but yes
[00:29:20] don't feel sorry about the free print
[00:29:21] it's a small token okay I know and I'm
[00:29:24] not gonna like force them to take money
[00:29:25] like I get it because I give gifts to
[00:29:27] feel too but I also think artists are
[00:29:28] like dude I can't like I feel like it
[00:29:31] takes a lot of talent and they get
[00:29:33] underpaid so like let me
[00:29:35] show my gratitude
[00:29:39] give the ad okay here's my my big flaw
[00:29:42] as a person I took a card from everyone
[00:29:44] so it have all their ads but I [ __ ]
[00:29:47] don't have the exact ad for every print
[00:29:49] I wish I did I probably should have
[00:29:51] written down
[00:29:52] because I have them all I literally kept
[00:29:54] the stacks I could go through them in my
[00:29:55] free time unfortunately I just landed
[00:29:57] and I haven't had free time so I'll die
[00:29:59] later I hope it wasn't no I wasn't
[00:30:01] awkward it was awkward it was wholesome
[00:30:03] what's the time of video just the Tomah
[00:30:05] guide I made where Bob Jones was like
[00:30:06] [ __ ] you [ __ ] Tomah
[00:30:09] dude Bob Jones is the biggest hater he's
[00:30:12] my op
[00:30:13] it's skill not Talent okay but I use
[00:30:15] those words interchangeably
[00:30:19] a little bit of both
[00:30:22] anyways
[00:30:26] anyways
[00:30:37] okay what I could do is I could post the
[00:30:40] ad of every artist I have a card from in
[00:30:42] announcements the only problem is and I
[00:30:45] I think I will but the only problem is I
[00:30:47] don't know if it's everyone and that I'd
[00:30:49] feel really bad if like I because I know
[00:30:51] for a fact some people didn't have a
[00:30:52] card like they ran out so like it won't
[00:30:55] be an exhaustive list it'll just be some
[00:30:57] people
[00:30:59] yeah that's all and a lot of them were
[00:31:01] like Fang's friends but
[00:31:03] yeah okay so that's that hope you guys
[00:31:05] enjoyed that uh I'll talk about what
[00:31:07] happened and what we did better than
[00:31:09] nothing yeah I'll put like I'll go
[00:31:10] through that for sure they're all in a
[00:31:12] bag but my bag is in another bag and
[00:31:14] then the bag is in the bag so thank you
[00:31:20] um we have a lot more to talk about but
[00:31:21] I'm Gonna Save most of it for when we're
[00:31:23] in game because impact is just chatting
[00:31:25] but before we do that awesome Google
[00:31:27] Chrome tabs to go over
[00:31:30] uh because I opened some stuff to talk
[00:31:32] about the first and the only unpleasant
[00:31:34] thing I wanted to talk about
[00:31:36] um is I was
[00:31:38] okay I was on my phone
[00:31:41] a post
[00:31:43] from someone
[00:31:46] now okay no name dropping well you guys
[00:31:48] are gonna see it but you know be nice to
[00:31:50] people don't harass anyone all that but
[00:31:52] I just saw a post from someone who I
[00:31:54] remembered as like taking characters
[00:31:56] that were coming soon and so am I let me
[00:31:59] say this in a nice way okay basically
[00:32:01] whitewashing characters like like a
[00:32:03] character that was black they would draw
[00:32:04] them Shades lighter and be like that's
[00:32:06] fine which
[00:32:07] look I'm not an artist but why are you
[00:32:10] doing that anyways and then this I was
[00:32:13] like you know what not my not my like
[00:32:15] I'm not here to [ __ ] be like swing my
[00:32:18] dick at Justice and tell people like I'm
[00:32:20] I'm stupid so I I you know I live in
[00:32:23] love
[00:32:24] today
[00:32:25] they um
[00:32:28] they quote tweeted Alejandro's the VA
[00:32:32] that signed my [ __ ] my genuine entity
[00:32:35] I took a picture with them
[00:32:38] this guy look how awesome he is look at
[00:32:40] his smile I mean obviously it's
[00:32:41] parasocial like I don't actually know
[00:32:43] him but you know
[00:32:45] what's up
[00:32:46] quote tweeted him on a poster he's like
[00:32:49] hey like my personal opinion he wasn't
[00:32:50] being like this is the law his personal
[00:32:52] opinion was just hey my personal opinion
[00:32:54] is I I like you know All Ships do
[00:32:57] whatever you want just don't you know
[00:32:58] nothing that's like incest or nothing
[00:33:00] that's like children
[00:33:03] you know no I don't I don't do ships at
[00:33:06] all like I don't care I just [ __ ] me and
[00:33:08] Shout [ __ ] you I don't care I don't care
[00:33:10] let people have their fun do what you
[00:33:11] want I don't give a [ __ ] but you know if
[00:33:13] you think about it like you ask a normal
[00:33:15] person hey
[00:33:16] you know
[00:33:18] is it weird to
[00:33:20] be like you know shipping children with
[00:33:23] an adult yeah that's kind of [ __ ] up
[00:33:25] that should go to jail
[00:33:26] that's what a person would say like I
[00:33:28] don't so I was scrolling and I saw okay
[00:33:31] look look
[00:33:32] I can't show you the thread because I
[00:33:35] ratio them so hard they blocked me
[00:33:37] I'm not even kidding they literally like
[00:33:39] they they I literally they literally
[00:33:42] blocked me so
[00:33:44] uh I can't show you the thread and
[00:33:46] obviously don't harass anyone like be
[00:33:49] nice
[00:33:50] but they're really just like yo voice
[00:33:53] actors are so insufferable like and like
[00:33:55] a threat like this guy wrote like five
[00:33:57] [ __ ] paragraphs and like multiple
[00:33:59] responses okay one or out of two and
[00:34:02] then he kept going past two because he
[00:34:04] can't count [ __ ] it I dropped at two
[00:34:06] months anyways so and all the Tweet was
[00:34:09] and like I don't again I don't care like
[00:34:11] I am not in this space so I don't give a
[00:34:13] f like I am not part of this so it
[00:34:16] doesn't involve me and I was like I'm
[00:34:17] not gonna respond but all the but then I
[00:34:20] looked at it and all the people were
[00:34:21] saying was like hey my opinion it wasn't
[00:34:23] like the law it was his opinion hey I'm
[00:34:25] up into all the ships like you know via
[00:34:27] the character I don't miss all the
[00:34:28] shifts just make sure it's
[00:34:29] age-appropriate and not incest
[00:34:33] like that was their own personal
[00:34:34] boundary it's not like everyone has to
[00:34:37] which by the way personally I don't see
[00:34:40] why anyone would want to do like incest
[00:34:44] plus people like a child like it's weird
[00:34:46] it's just double like I I think that
[00:34:48] even if he was saying it as a general
[00:34:49] statement it's fair but usually gonna
[00:34:51] say hey I just don't support that
[00:34:53] everything else is fine
[00:34:54] and then he also replied with like and
[00:34:56] consent like you know like normal things
[00:34:59] I quoted like who are you to dictate
[00:35:01] shifts [ __ ]
[00:35:03] are you
[00:35:05] to talk
[00:35:06] close your mouth
[00:35:08] go do your homework what are you talking
[00:35:10] about
[00:35:12] anyways so I was like I was like really
[00:35:14] like I had a a five minute conversation
[00:35:17] with myself like Alex don't respond you
[00:35:19] don't have to respond every time I see
[00:35:21] someone responding to someone that's
[00:35:23] like and they're like bigger it's like
[00:35:24] why are you giving them attention why
[00:35:26] are you but then I was like dude this
[00:35:27] guy he's such a dumbass and then I was
[00:35:30] also like he did a one out of two and
[00:35:32] then under a two out of oh yeah wait a
[00:35:34] two out of two and I was like do you
[00:35:36] really need that and then he went on so
[00:35:37] I was like I have the funniest response
[00:35:39] and then I was like okay so on one hand
[00:35:41] they deserve to be called out and on the
[00:35:43] other hand it's really funny what I
[00:35:45] could say
[00:35:46] so I I was like you know what I'm a
[00:35:49] comedian so I did a URL one on two
[00:35:52] [ __ ] dumbass two on two ratioed him
[00:35:54] despite responding a day and a half
[00:35:56] later and then he blocked me so now if I
[00:35:58] pull up the thread oh uh yeah
[00:36:02] uh if I pull up the thread it's
[00:36:05] literally wait where is it you literally
[00:36:07] can't see it where is it
[00:36:11] oh wait he Unblock Me Oh
[00:36:14] oh no he did wait what the [ __ ]
[00:36:18] whatever coward doesn't matter don't
[00:36:19] harass like it doesn't matter like again
[00:36:21] their entire existence is probably oh a
[00:36:23] streamer saw my post that's probably
[00:36:25] their entire accomplishment of their
[00:36:27] whole life so don't belittle them don't
[00:36:29] be mean to them because let them have
[00:36:30] their Moment Like honestly let them have
[00:36:32] the moment
[00:36:34] but I just think it was weird and weirdo
[00:36:36] Behavior so I felt like I'm not one to
[00:36:39] take the moral High ground and be like
[00:36:41] oh [ __ ] you but also it was funny and it
[00:36:44] was deserved and I saw them in the past
[00:36:46] being racist so it was like double
[00:36:48] deserved so there you go
[00:36:53] now but like
[00:36:57] makes us look bad like if anyone does
[00:36:59] [ __ ] that's like weird it makes all of
[00:37:00] us look bad like let's say it's like
[00:37:01] like okay let's say person a to
[00:37:03] something wrong and then person B calls
[00:37:05] them out and then person a is like oh
[00:37:06] now I'm
[00:37:07] getting like people are telling me that
[00:37:10] I shouldn't live and then it's like
[00:37:11] person B looks bad so just be nice be
[00:37:14] normal don't you know but yeah so [ __ ]
[00:37:16] that guy anyways other than that
[00:37:18] um there's a new zog's donut wall so
[00:37:20] there you go
[00:37:25] said you showing this on stream I mean
[00:37:27] I've said this before like I'm giving
[00:37:29] all the disclaimers of like you know it
[00:37:30] is what it is but also it's someone like
[00:37:32] promoting bad [ __ ] on a public platform
[00:37:35] and expecting no repercussions it's like
[00:37:36] just you know I'm not like be nice like
[00:37:39] it is what it is but like everything
[00:37:41] about them is
[00:37:43] bad after bad so I was like if you're
[00:37:46] gonna voice your dog [ __ ] opinion
[00:37:47] publicly
[00:37:49] then you deserve to get dunked on
[00:37:50] publicly you play new Carnival no but I
[00:37:53] downloaded it but I then I realized what
[00:37:55] it was so no further discussions can be
[00:37:57] held
[00:38:02] um wait what else I want to show you
[00:38:03] guys
[00:38:05] oh yeah we have to react to the Fountain
[00:38:06] teaser but I'll wait for that because I
[00:38:08] haven't watched yet we'll do that in
[00:38:09] like a minute uh I'm gonna click on all
[00:38:11] these images I don't remember what they
[00:38:12] are oh yeah I'm at koi this is Fang this
[00:38:14] is me I'm taller but she has heels uh
[00:38:16] and the perspective but anyways I'm
[00:38:18] taller uh koi and Laura
[00:38:22] the resident sleeper as I told you guys
[00:38:25] uh I also yeah
[00:38:27] okay that's
[00:38:29] and there's a video coming out
[00:38:31] wow wow socks
[00:38:39] okay it is
[00:38:41] oh yeah I did Chad do you guys see this
[00:38:42] short the guys destroyed wait wrong
[00:38:45] where the [ __ ] my what is playing
[00:38:47] right now
[00:38:51] there's only good on one character no
[00:38:53] it's not no no it's not yeah okay riddle
[00:38:55] me this cookie and Tomah before dendro
[00:38:57] they weren't used that much they weren't
[00:38:59] then Daniel came out and now people are
[00:39:01] calling kooky the official of Genji true
[00:39:03] copy of that cookie cookie saved my life
[00:39:06] she's like the cosmo of Genji right now
[00:39:08] it's only really used on Xiao but not
[00:39:10] only is it versatile because the two
[00:39:12] piece gives you a time percent when you
[00:39:13] take damage in your burst the four piece
[00:39:15] also gives you a ton of attack percent
[00:39:17] so when we get the new region of conoria
[00:39:19] and Dane sleeps
[00:39:21] prism damages you and gives you damage
[00:39:24] percent the vermillions that will give
[00:39:25] you attack when you take damage making
[00:39:28] Vermillion best in slot on every
[00:39:30] character especially those without their
[00:39:32] signature set so while we don't discuss
[00:39:34] leaks on this channel I think let's just
[00:39:36] call it a hunch that for Millions
[00:39:39] yeah it used to be called void [ __ ] now
[00:39:42] it's void prism
[00:39:43] also a lot of people were like
[00:39:46] uh well some people got the joke but
[00:39:48] some people wouldn't get the joke of
[00:39:49] like
[00:39:50] kooky is official as official isn't from
[00:39:52] Gadget that's the joke and some people
[00:39:54] are coping like fish was actually from
[00:39:56] Hawkeye is like no and that wasn't the
[00:39:59] joke it was just because yeah it is so
[00:40:01] here's what it is
[00:40:03] um
[00:40:09] um also like the first frame of this
[00:40:10] video uh we're gonna now
[00:40:13] so Jeff made that into a Pog so now when
[00:40:15] you type Hogan's death channel is that
[00:40:17] uh we're gonna now pull for the ultra
[00:40:20] and Yukon dude I haven't seen starrell
[00:40:22] in so long but yeah I don't always feel
[00:40:25] bad talking about [ __ ] that's like
[00:40:27] uncomfortable
[00:40:29] like even when I know I'm right because
[00:40:31] I don't know what repercussions it could
[00:40:33] have so I'm trying to tread carefully
[00:40:35] with like the last thing we talked about
[00:40:37] because like the dude's [ __ ] but like
[00:40:38] I also don't want like people to be mean
[00:40:40] so like you know just be normal but yeah
[00:40:42] it's always like
[00:40:43] yeah I also think my response is funny
[00:40:45] so it's it's yeah
[00:40:49] dude when people write it I think that
[00:40:53] you're out one on two dumbass two on two
[00:40:55] is hilarious anyways okay we're gonna
[00:40:57] watch um but also like to be fair you
[00:40:59] can always just
[00:41:01] if the person is a good person they
[00:41:03] would delete it and be like sorry but I
[00:41:05] saw all of their responses be like oh
[00:41:07] everyone in the quote tweets has the
[00:41:09] same thing in their bio which is
[00:41:10] probably just

[00:47:31] cool while in general I hate characters
[00:47:35] that don't look epic that's not true
[00:47:37] okay I think magicians are [ __ ] sick
[00:47:39] that was my point I played a lot of
[00:47:41] Twisted Fate In League uh and I like
[00:47:43] magician characters in most trolls I
[00:47:45] just think magicians look [ __ ] sick
[00:47:46] especially if they shoot cards I think
[00:47:48] that's [ __ ] sick
[00:47:50] however I don't know if they're gonna
[00:47:52] play I I don't know but I know one is a
[00:47:54] Nemo and I'm a Nemo man

[01:02:20] but even the exceptions I still like
[01:02:22] like I usually don't care about like
[01:02:24] like [ __ ] toddler characters which
[01:02:26] like this one's actually kind of cute
[01:02:27] and then
[01:02:29] I mean okay to be fair Charlotte is big

[01:02:58] yeah okay I didn't really okay here's
[01:03:01] what I was gonna say I think
[01:03:05] Levi's VA sounds insane so whichever
[01:03:08] character has his VA I want to play but
[01:03:11] also I like the fact that the English
[01:03:12] one's a bit deeper so I don't know how
[01:03:16] to feel I like both we'll see
[01:03:18] simple
[01:03:21] [Music]
[01:03:25] Chinese is deeper as well
[01:03:27] link to the other one
[01:03:31] or I can look it up uh genshin sien
[01:03:34] channel oh someone already has it thank
[01:03:37] you

[01:03:43] want to take too much time but I want to
[01:03:44] hear this at least
[01:03:50] how do you pronounce okay I just say
[01:03:52] noviet how I would say it in French I
[01:03:54] don't know how you're supposed to say it
[01:03:55] like I'll probably say it the way
[01:03:57] English like I I don't know but I it's
[01:03:59] okay because like the the way you say
[01:04:02] big man Bubba uh l-e-t-e is like yet so
[01:04:07] it's like nive yet but I don't know if

[01:04:50] like very pleasing to listen to so I I
[01:04:53] don't know
[01:04:54] I don't think it suits him as well but I
[01:04:56] think it'll work because it's him so it
[01:04:57] doesn't matter

[01:14:16] Claymore
[01:14:22] um which means that you're definitely
[01:14:23] gonna
[01:14:26] you're definitely gonna shatter if you
[01:14:28] freeze
[01:14:30] but I don't know if you're gonna play
[01:14:32] I'm not even playing them so it is what
[01:14:33] it is maybe it's like a support or

[01:29:50] told you that like you know the burn on
[01:29:51] my hand that's like kind of recovering
[01:29:52] you know I told you I got that from
[01:29:54] saving a bunch of kittens from a burning
[01:29:56] building and then I had to go back and
[01:29:57] save a toddler yeah no big deal uh but
[01:30:00] what happened it was actually crazy
[01:30:01] because it turns out that the toddler
[01:30:03] that I saved was actually okay you guys
[01:30:06] won't believe this but was a top game
[01:30:09] developers baby now I'm not gonna say
[01:30:11] who I'm not gonna expose them but they
[01:30:13] really were grateful that I saved their
[01:30:15] baby so what happened that you guys
[01:30:17] won't believe this was they said hey let
[01:30:19] me please make you an executive game
[01:30:22] design lead
[01:30:24] yeah
[01:30:25] now I think I would do a good job okay I
[01:30:28] would fix Dale I would give us buff
[01:30:29] characters I would let us pet dogs there
[01:30:32] would be floor 15 I would if uh all
[01:30:35] anyone who's free to play their account
[01:30:36] will get deleted
[01:30:39] but I would chose to politely decline
[01:30:43] and they offered me resin
[01:30:45] they said zox look I'm a big fan of
[01:30:48] yours
[01:30:49] let me at least give you resin for
[01:30:51] troubles and I declined that I declined
[01:30:55] so I didn't even they said I'd give you
[01:30:57] two thousand res and I said no
[01:30:59] so I don't even I didn't even accept the
[01:31:01] resin
[01:31:03] I didn't even accept the resin
[01:31:07] so that's how humble I am
[01:31:16] I got [ __ ]
[01:31:18] kind of told this last stream but I got
[01:31:20] stopped at the airport on the way to LA
[01:31:22] because they the [ __ ] TSA person
[01:31:24] didn't believe what I did or like didn't
[01:31:27] really understand so I had to explain
[01:31:29] them everything and then like I kind of
[01:31:31] said like
[01:31:32] like they thought I was lying to them
[01:31:34] because like you know you could just say
[01:31:35] like it's for fun if you want like
[01:31:37] because I'm [ __ ] like as a Canadian
[01:31:39] you could just go to the states don't
[01:31:40] need a reason but then they were like
[01:31:41] mad at me because like I was kind of
[01:31:43] like
[01:31:44] because I didn't I couldn't explain what
[01:31:46] Anime Expo was to like a 60 year old I
[01:31:49] don't know I just couldn't explain it so
[01:31:51] I I had and then they I started saying
[01:31:52] okay I just I work for Google because I
[01:31:54] make YouTube videos and then they're
[01:31:55] like does YouTube pay you in USD or in
[01:31:57] CAD and then I was like
[01:31:58] I I was it took literally like 20
[01:32:01] minutes to explain and then at the end
[01:32:03] they literally someone else had to step
[01:32:06] in and say look like what they're trying
[01:32:09] to say is this I know this person they
[01:32:11] saved my baby from a burning building
[01:32:15] and we're gonna spend that uh on the
[01:32:18] domain of our choice so I'm thinking not
[01:32:20] Vermillion because we've already spent
[01:32:22] so much so we're not gonna do it really
[01:32:24] but we have two dozen resin to spend
[01:32:25] anywhere else
[01:32:27] um I said hey might as well hit the cap
[01:32:28] uh obviously I
[01:32:32] yeah I can't go higher but they gave me
[01:32:34] two thousand resin I spent 40 so now
[01:32:35] we're at 1960 which I'm sure eventful
[01:32:37] things happened during that year but
[01:32:39] that is how much resin we have uh it was
[01:32:42] supposed to be 2 000 but
[01:32:45] um I was too humble about it and I opted
[01:32:48] to not go all the way
[01:32:52] um
[01:32:54] also we're not done the okay I didn't
[01:32:56] have time to play I was on my [ __ ]
[01:32:57] phone so I would uncap my resin but I
[01:33:00] literally didn't do much grief I had
[01:33:01] enough time to do it so we'll do that
[01:33:02] either today or next stream also to
[01:33:04] everyone who's like socks what the [ __ ]
[01:33:06] why is your resin so capped I literally
[01:33:08] uncapped it every day I auto battled on
[01:33:10] Star rail I missed two or three days but
[01:33:12] other than that I auto battled
[01:33:13] pre-framed on Thor rail every day I
[01:33:15] launched Cookie Run Kingdom I launched
[01:33:17] genshin and guess what I [ __ ] farmed
[01:33:19] Mora and other things there's a socks
[01:33:21] you did [ __ ] far more you have two
[01:33:22] thousand resins so how did that happen
[01:33:24] okay if I didn't Farm Maura explain how
[01:33:26] I currently have more Mora than I've
[01:33:28] ever had in my life look at this eight
[01:33:31] million when I saw that number I didn't
[01:33:33] even believe it
[01:33:36] 8 million when have you ever seen me
[01:33:38] with more than one

[01:34:00] for them they were like
[01:34:03] ziox you're so tall can you pull for me
[01:34:06] and I said okay sure and normally I
[01:34:08] would have recorded it in case it was
[01:34:10] stop saying Envy has 9 million more
[01:34:11] that's not the point anyways
[01:34:14] I'm addicted to artifact farming every
[01:34:17] step is is a good step if there's a
[01:34:19] recovering addict who's like hey I'm a
[01:34:21] month sober you're not gonna think oh
[01:34:23] I'm two months sober [ __ ] you that's or
[01:34:25] that's not important no every step
[01:34:26] counts I've never had a million Mora

[01:44:26] youngest son from a burning building
[01:44:29] we do I not deserve a bit of
[01:44:31] compensation for that I mean I think I
[01:44:33] would
[01:44:39] like I did it just to be a Good
[01:44:41] Samaritan I didn't expect anything in

[01:45:21] yo there's the prime
[01:45:24] you know I'm sorry for Fountain story
[01:45:26] because I remember doing Subarus and I

[01:45:43] dude I missed you while you were gone or
[01:45:45] like I needed my fix of Zog streams I
[01:45:48] don't know if I should be like flattered
[01:45:50] or like concerned because like if you're
[01:45:53] like if you go nine days without a
[01:45:55] stream and you're like getting
[01:45:56] withdrawals I think that's concerning
[01:45:59] like I would see a medical professional
[01:46:02] hello zaj I missed you too
[01:46:15] much
[01:46:17] maybe you should see one too I don't
[01:46:19] need a doctor doctors need me
[01:46:23] I could teach them I could teach a
[01:46:25] therapist things that they didn't see in
[01:46:26] their manuals so why would it if
[01:46:29] anything I'd be doing them a favor
[01:46:32] thank you
[01:46:39] appreciate it
[01:46:40] hope your stream went well
[01:46:46] I have to skip the song
[01:46:58] hope you're feeling better little bro
[01:47:01] little cause you're short
[01:47:04] leave me a little because I'm short
[01:47:09] listen
[01:47:11] careful to you I never everyone's like
[01:47:13] oh fob is short
[01:47:14] but I literally Tower over you
[01:47:18] I literally am colossal and if you don't
[01:47:21] believe me believe an artist okay I
[01:47:24] don't know why an artist would lie what
[01:47:26] they do is is not easy
[01:47:28] and an artist tweeted
[01:47:30] hey thank you for stopping by our table
[01:47:33] I drew a doodle of how tall and how much
[01:47:36] of a giga Chad and Riz Mr socks was and
[01:47:40] this is me
[01:47:42] compared to a five nine and a five one
[01:47:44] person and if they were to draw fob you
[01:47:46] would be somewhere around there so why
[01:47:49] would they lie do you have to believe me
[01:47:51] but believe them that's all I'm saying
[01:47:53] that's all I'm saying
[01:47:55] people saying alt account do you think I
[01:47:57] could draw this art on do you think I
[01:48:00] have this level of talent
[01:48:02] no no I don't
[01:48:05] and if I do then you're admitting that
[01:48:08] either I'm tall or I'm talented
[01:48:14] there is no in between
[01:48:19] what are the replies like okay
[01:48:22] all right we're not gonna look at the
[01:48:24] replies
[01:48:26] foreign
[01:48:35] okay chat I actually want to if I'm
[01:48:37] gonna talk to you guys anyways I want to
[01:48:39] do it while I farm something we have 2
[01:48:40] 000 resin because we helped the
[01:48:42] ambassador of a small country and they
[01:48:44] gifted us resin so where should we spend
[01:48:46] it if I'm responsible I should do Mora
[01:48:48] and prep for fonten so Ascend characters
[01:48:50] that I want ascended before Fanta comes
[01:48:52] out
[01:48:52] but so not responsible so I'm down to do
[01:48:54] a domain now since we all suspect that
[01:48:58] hey maybe you know Vermillion will be
[01:49:00] best installed when we get more
[01:49:01] characters uh that damage you Vermillion
[01:49:04] could be a good idea but we could also
[01:49:06] do a domain that we know no matter what
[01:49:08] won't be in the strong box which is
[01:49:10] deepwood and gilded or we could say [ __ ]
[01:49:13] artifacts xyox do a bunch of Mora
[01:49:16] actually let's calculate how much moral
[01:49:18] we would get so that if I get bad
[01:49:20] artifacts today you could type minus
[01:49:22] that number so let me pull up a
[01:49:24] calculator real quick obviously I could
[01:49:25] do the math in my head
[01:49:27] I don't want to do that for obvious
[01:49:30] reasons yo milk these are fifty dollars
[01:49:34] can I see your Noel build player for 4.0
[01:49:37] um
[01:49:39] okay on one hand I don't want to scam
[01:49:41] you on the other hand I don't want to
[01:49:42] play Noel
[01:49:44] um maybe that was a typo I can show you
[01:49:46] my Ito build which is the exact same as
[01:49:48] my Noel build so he's not a red horn
[01:49:50] Stone thresher level 90. uh with a four
[01:49:53] husk and a 63.9 271 ratio now I have a
[01:49:57] better commercial than this but I think
[01:49:58] bigger crit damage bigger person so this
[01:50:00] is what we're using and Noel would be
[01:50:02] the same
[01:50:04] we good player though
[01:50:05] anyways so let's have two thousand resin
[01:50:07] right that's twenty thousand two
[01:50:09] thousand okay and then each instance of
[01:50:12] 20 resin gives us 60k model or 61k
[01:50:16] because we have
[01:50:19] um ar-60 you get an extra K so 100 times
[01:50:22] you so you just add two zeros to 61
[01:50:25] 000.
[01:50:27] we will get 6.1 million [ __ ]
[01:50:32] so 6.1 million Mora is what we are
[01:50:34] trading right now for whatever artifacts
[01:50:37] I get today just so you guys know that
[01:50:40] what would you choose guaranteed 6
[01:50:42] million Mora or whatever artifacts I'm
[01:50:44] gonna get
[01:50:46] all right we'll see
[01:50:47] we'll see
[01:50:49] foreign
[01:50:54] C
[01:50:58] okay so what are we doing wait is my
[01:51:00] ball pass level two okay
[01:51:05] oh yeah I have to speed run through the
[01:51:06] artifacts on mobile while I was
[01:51:08] traveling
[01:51:09] I don't even open the wishing menu
[01:51:14] I guess I should chart just in case but
[01:51:16] you
[01:51:19] well I have seven single bowls
[01:51:22] what's my history can I get a four star
[01:51:25] no I'm not doing a literature guide I'll
[01:51:27] probably do a blader calf going though
[01:51:31] did I okay so I got my bypass to 47
[01:51:33] before I reset and then I bought the
[01:51:35] last three levels because like it's it's
[01:51:36] or 48 or 47 and then it was worth it
[01:51:39] because the last level is 680 Primos
[01:51:42] I tried I literally did TCG dude I was
[01:51:45] traveling I wasn't gonna be anti-social
[01:51:50] Four Star
[01:51:56] I mean it's five it's five I mean
[01:51:59] I think five
[01:52:03] yeah I do not want to pull on these
[01:52:05] banners
[01:52:06] Thomas
[01:52:08] he said razor no point Mika no point
[01:52:11] didn't you also
[01:52:13] yeah
[01:52:15] uh fans are gonna be strong
[01:52:23] you speak French yeah
[01:52:28] okay where is the light resin do I do
[01:52:30] bosses
[01:52:32] or I'll have to do weekly bosses okay
[01:52:34] we'll start with the weekly bosses
[01:52:38] awesome
[01:52:46] Ellie this is [ __ ]
[01:52:54] foreign
[01:53:04] hey guys
[01:53:06] I got a ola
[01:53:09] I'm a surgeon Dr baiju
[01:53:14] okay five beta okay two emblem
[01:53:20] um fabulon
[01:53:28] okay what the [ __ ] is this
[01:53:31] is this a physical
[01:53:41] you know what I'll play healer don't
[01:53:43] worry team I got you the soft cream
[01:53:47] all right maybe I'll take one more day
[01:53:49] off and knock out the rest of the work
[01:53:51] once I'm filling up
[01:53:59] they put the fast on the wrong character
[01:54:02] dude the Jeff plays fav I'll hide them
[01:54:06] and then when you ask him about it he's
[01:54:07] like it's optimal
[01:54:15] oh yeah dendro gets his lost socks oops
[01:54:18] I mean it's not we're just a Healer
[01:54:23] wait where's everyone
[01:54:26] oh
[01:54:33] why did you play Go call me because
[01:54:35] she's 10. we're trying to get as much
[01:54:37] friendship as we can because at first
[01:54:39] they used to not care about friendship
[01:54:40] and I still kind of don't but then I
[01:54:42] realized we're not getting end games so
[01:54:43] the real end game is friendship cards so
[01:54:45] we might as well work on friendship does
[01:54:47] that make sense
[01:54:57] remember help comes first
[01:55:00] remember health comes first
[01:55:05] mind the side effects
[01:55:07] yeah this is a song from Cookie Run
[01:55:10] Kingdom that's how I found it
[01:55:16] do I need another cookie run sponsored
[01:55:19] stream I'm addicted
[01:55:22] on anyone yeah it's good for on-field
[01:55:24] Catalyst like even if you're playing
[01:55:25] like nahid on field
[01:55:27] family but on field it's pretty decent
[01:55:29] Mona likes fabulot in like three's teams
[01:55:32] because she needs approximately six
[01:55:33] million er
[01:55:35] um
[01:55:36] and then you can also use it on like
[01:55:38] energy hungry Catalyst in general like
[01:55:40] even like um what's his name can use it
[01:55:43] usually I like Amber on him though
[01:55:45] protect Amber but
[01:55:48] a bitter pill to swallow
[01:55:55] taking a turn for the best
[01:55:59] tank face sure if you don't need uh
[01:56:01] thrilling Tails but Thrones is pretty
[01:56:02] fogging
[01:56:04] am I just healing so good yeah it's
[01:56:06] really comfy that you could just skill
[01:56:07] and heal everyone I really like it
[01:56:14] what do you think about Scaro what do
[01:56:15] you mean as a character or like metal
[01:56:16] eyes
[01:56:19] I probably should revisit him because he
[01:56:21] just felt like
[01:56:22] um
[01:56:25] I remember when I first played him in
[01:56:27] the abyss the abyss was like Omega not
[01:56:30] thought I was like turbo aged so like it
[01:56:32] was really like not fun to play because
[01:56:34] he needed like a shield and you couldn't
[01:56:37] really yeah you just got like knocked
[01:56:38] around everywhere
[01:56:40] but he's basically flying Hazel unless
[01:56:42] AOE than ciao
[01:56:46] it's fun what is your scar named us
[01:56:48] yeah a bitter pill to swallow I forget
[01:57:01] mine the side effects
[01:57:04] chat a hundred gifted if I enter on the
[01:57:06] last possible frame three two one
[01:57:10] okay that wasn't really the last for him
[01:57:11] but close enough
[01:57:13] he died
[01:57:15] comes first
[01:57:21] yeah
[01:57:22] how do you not get burned out that's my
[01:57:24] secret I don't actually like okay I I
[01:57:28] launched Genji into like test things or
[01:57:30] record or to stream that's it or like
[01:57:32] spend my daily resin that's literally it
[01:57:34] like I'm not gonna be like I that's
[01:57:37] actually why I just take breaks or play
[01:57:38] other games or do other stuff and then I
[01:57:41] because I I kind of rekindled my love
[01:57:42] for the game every now and then like
[01:57:44] whenever I get hype about something I'm
[01:57:45] like super motivated like now when I'm
[01:57:48] like really hyped for like Fontana like
[01:57:50] super excited
[01:57:52] meanwhile the Jeff will launch genshin
[01:57:55] go to the abyss for eight hours and then
[01:57:57] want to cry true I mean that's me too
[01:58:00] but
[01:58:01] I need to I can't do that consistently
[01:58:03] or like I actually killed
[01:58:12] bitter pill to swallow but like that's
[01:58:15] why I didn't export Inazuma like
[01:58:17] obviously Inazuma that just came out so
[01:58:18] we'll finish it soon
[01:58:21] emergency
[01:58:22] but like
[01:58:25] I feel like when Inazuma exploration was
[01:58:28] happening that I was like
[01:58:31] I would yeah I don't know I would rather
[01:58:33] just not do that
[01:58:34] but I enjoyed Subaru exploration except
[01:58:37] the desert desert exploring is kind of
[01:58:38] ass
[01:58:41] dude how are we doing no damage
[01:58:45] does Ryden not have burst
[01:58:51] mind the side effects yo yo yo yo

[02:06:46] this one
[02:06:48] five percent ER 19 attack 11 HP 7
[02:06:51] defense
[02:06:55] kooky I mean
[02:06:57] kooky doesn't want an electro goblet on
[02:07:00] glad
[02:07:01] if you're playing aggravate you can go
[02:07:03] Electro but even then you want some
[02:07:05] stats that aren't any of those and then
[02:07:06] if you're going hyperbloom you want em
[02:07:08] and if you're going full healer that's
[02:07:10] kind of cringe just go em
[02:07:16] all right
[02:07:22] haircut when probably this week
[02:07:34] whoopers I just got a drop okay who says
[02:07:37] whoopers
[02:07:41] huh
[02:07:43] foreign
[02:08:03] ah
[02:08:06] hello
[02:08:25] [Music]
[02:08:26] dude why is my day on a level one weapon
[02:08:29] dude
[02:08:42] [Music]
[02:08:45] you're dead meat
[02:08:51] yeah well that was not fun
[02:08:54] [Music]
[02:08:56] my day is actually not bad though like
[02:08:57] with an actual weapon because she's also
[02:08:59] C1
[02:09:01] why are you stalling I'm not okay okay
[02:09:04] we can just pick oh I have to do this
[02:09:06] too whatever we can pick we can pick
[02:09:07] what domains to do right now
[02:09:10] um
[02:09:15] I think we should do
[02:09:20] sale these are nine months
[02:09:23] physical Xiao ain't no way I don't think
[02:09:26] we should do Vermillion again like are
[02:09:28] we already dude dude I think dude dude
[02:09:30] okay listen we need a break from her
[02:09:33] like I love Vermillion but I think
[02:09:35] brakes are good
[02:09:36] they're healthy
[02:09:51] this set sucks this set is like this
[02:09:54] that's fine
[02:09:56] no
[02:09:59] no
[02:10:04] suck dude why why do I not why does no
[02:10:07] artifact set look good to me anymore
[02:10:08] honestly at this point they all look bad
[02:10:10] so we might as well go for a million
[02:10:11] because like okay listen
[02:10:13] here's the here's the take okay I
[02:10:15] already have really good deep wood and
[02:10:17] really good gilded except in EM Sands so
[02:10:19] we could go try to get a yam Sans
[02:10:21] also no matter what we're getting like
[02:10:24] we're for sure getting emblem in the
[02:10:25] strong box that's imagine being so we're
[02:10:28] gonna get perfectly
[02:10:30] thanks for this and verbillion looks
[02:10:33] pretty good zero X flowers I zero X not
[02:10:38] it's not sauce we're just it's like
[02:10:40] Shirley surely we get every set
[02:10:48] do you review characters yeah from time
[02:10:50] to time I'm gonna open whale Academy
[02:10:51] forms and then after that we're gonna do
[02:10:53] just a normal uid review for like
[02:10:55] everyone I think I don't want to do in
[02:10:57] that order one before font 10 one after
[02:11:10] okay Chad what if I do what if I like
[02:11:12] roll the dice no I don't want to roll
[02:11:14] the dice
[02:11:18] let's roll it yolandice okay if if we
[02:11:21] roll uh six we do Vermillion if we roll
[02:11:25] a three we do deep wood
[02:11:27] I didn't plan for one
[02:11:29] okay
[02:11:32] six is Vermillion five is
[02:11:39] the million
[02:11:42] is emblem
[02:11:44] and three is also Vermillion
[02:11:53] one and two is nothing
[02:12:00] foreign
[02:12:18] easy for the Vermillion wanters and chat
[02:12:23] okay this isn't gonna be made into a
[02:12:25] video but just in case we get like a
[02:12:27] god-like showpiece
[02:12:29] whoa what's up
[02:12:31] a thousand resin that you're gonna spend
[02:12:32] in the Vermillion domain again yeah
[02:12:35] can't wait to see what we get stay tuned
[02:12:37] for more content
[02:12:43] okay we're gonna alternate domains
[02:12:44] though we'll we'll look I'm a very I'm
[02:12:48] not superstitious
[02:12:49] but I think that there are signs given
[02:12:52] to you for example if you go in
[02:12:54] Vermillion and it's feeding you well
[02:12:56] maybe you stay there but if you go and
[02:12:59] you just get defense after defense after
[02:13:00] defense maybe on that particular day you
[02:13:03] should try somewhere else that's all I'm
[02:13:05] saying
[02:13:07] that's all I'm saying
[02:13:09] let's play a team that needs friendship
[02:13:12] um
[02:13:20] oh by the way chat
[02:13:35] I got 100 cents I know
[02:13:38] off stream because he was in I was just
[02:13:40] doing a random domain but
[02:13:41] or more other lines yeah
[02:13:45] took way too [ __ ] long I left him at
[02:13:47] nine forever because I didn't want to
[02:13:48] put in my teapot because I don't want to
[02:13:50] put characters that I play in my teapot
[02:13:51] because that means I get to play them
[02:13:52] less but yeah really [ __ ] sick
[02:13:56] so there you go
[02:13:57] most of these characters that are like
[02:13:59] on top that we oh my God there's a must
[02:14:01] be [ __ ] fresh ten
[02:14:04] most of these characters are all 10 like
[02:14:05] 310
[02:14:08] nulu I guess I haven't played enough in
[02:14:11] domains but the thing with these like
[02:14:13] all of her supports are already friends
[02:14:14] with 10 it's kind of hard
[02:14:16] YouTube is also really close
[02:14:29] wait yula's not 10.
[02:14:39] [Music]
[02:14:45] oh we could do an Ito Daya team to get
[02:14:47] them both French of 10.
[02:14:50] true actually
[02:15:00] okay watch this
[02:15:03] watch this
[02:15:06] Ito
[02:15:08] Goro Daya
[02:15:15] got a job for me now we have so much
[02:15:17] defensive utility that we don't need a
[02:15:19] Healer
[02:15:21] so we can go sucrose to group them up
[02:15:24] and swirl Pyro
[02:15:26] my experiment
[02:15:28] will succeed this is definitely a team
[02:15:31] of all time
[02:15:32] I'm not gonna lie I've never been afraid
[02:15:34] that I won't be able to clear a domain
[02:15:37] before but ethos Goods that should be
[02:15:40] fine it looks like your own
[02:15:47] he feels actually good so it's fine
[02:16:10] okay
[02:16:13] all right wait why am I low HP what the
[02:16:16] [ __ ]
[02:16:20] okay
[02:16:22] let's go bro is playing call by himself
[02:16:25] okay that's not true
[02:16:28] this keep calm is the future watch you
[02:16:30] damn pyro swirl the pile throwing tails
[02:16:33] to go I don't think that's good do this
[02:16:35] who's she for energy
[02:16:38] only coming through
[02:16:42] yep uh-huh uh-huh yep yep yep atta boy
[02:16:52] yep boom one rotation
[02:16:55] how do we finish it with day off
[02:16:58] dude actually not bad
[02:17:00] now watch this burst jump cancel claim
[02:17:04] if you do it I only had three condensed
[02:17:05] whatever if you do it correctly
[02:17:08] you should get a crit rate circlet
[02:17:11] crit rate flower
[02:17:13] Let Me Clear damage
[02:17:23] can you show up here I'll hide them uh
[02:17:25] yeah but my item still doesn't have a
[02:17:26] good sense that's like the main weakness
[02:17:28] of him everything else is really good
[02:17:31] um
[02:17:33] is like since he if you're using a
[02:17:36] signature weapon it's really hard to get
[02:17:38] a good crit rate
[02:17:40] start because you get so much credential
[02:17:43] he doesn't have a career Ascension it's
[02:17:44] really hard to get enough credit on
[02:17:46] yourselves that
[02:17:48] um which is why like if I even if uh
[02:17:50] folio decision is like better than Jade
[02:17:52] for him my jade ratio looks a lot better
[02:17:55] but my stats are insane so uh flower oh
[02:17:58] my God what 47 a.m 12 VR and crit
[02:18:01] amazing feather same thing I also have
[02:18:03] other feathers that do a similar job uh
[02:18:06] with um many being very good so you know
[02:18:09] same thing uh Sans is my worst piece but
[02:18:11] offset is pretty good offset pretty good
[02:18:13] uh also if I need more ER I do like to
[02:18:15] use uh uh this one right here with 20
[02:18:18] why is the sunshine huh
[02:18:21] this one a 20 ER on it go all the way we
[02:18:23] have a decent digital one my best ones
[02:18:25] on deepwood but okay gilded I would like
[02:18:28] to use this one but it's heavy on the
[02:18:30] crew damage so I have to use the crit
[02:18:32] rate one even though it's worse it is
[02:18:33] what it is uh and then Circle we have 12
[02:18:35] grit damage 61 yeah 15 attack so uh yeah
[02:18:37] pretty good
[02:18:39] but as I said my jade cutter I'll hit
[02:18:41] them is better
[02:18:43] maybe we should go back to kill them
[02:18:48] okay if we get a batter for a million
[02:18:49] piece here I'll go gilded
[02:18:53] everyone on me
[02:18:55] it's showtime
[02:18:59] yeah this guy's not grouping but it's
[02:19:02] fine
[02:19:08] [Music]
[02:19:13] oh you're coming through
[02:19:16] dude why does using either burst not
[02:19:19] reset ushi's cooldown
[02:19:22] come on dude Razer does that wait why
[02:19:24] does jumping not cancel if it's
[02:19:26] descending why does why does Ito jumping
[02:19:28] not cancel his burst that's bad game
[02:19:30] design they should make it cancel
[02:19:35] it would be so sick
[02:19:41] I mean okay to be fair
[02:19:44] flowers Main stat is HP so you can use a
[02:19:48] four star if it's a flower
[02:19:50] so yeah we can lock that
[02:20:10] rally
[02:20:11] swirl Geo yep
[02:20:18] hey good get a rotation so far
[02:20:21] who wants some of this
[02:20:27] Bob atta boy
[02:20:41] I don't get mad at ushi he's just
[02:20:43] driving level two would never come back
[02:20:45] frown Miserables I would if I'm ever
[02:20:49] like Mia just checking Discord or

[02:23:06] okay what
[02:23:07] dude why why I have to look I love ayato

[02:24:21] good
[02:24:23] oh dude wait if it actually rolled again
[02:24:25] it would have been better than this one
[02:24:29] it's still about as good
[02:24:33] the critical value is a little bit lower
[02:24:36] but it has attack percents
[02:24:41] no
[02:24:46] thanks to the drops bat chest whoa drops
[02:24:49] it's trash no it's not it's on set it's

[02:26:45] that
[02:26:46] what do you mean by that
[02:26:48] I think I would argue it's actually the
[02:26:50] same experience I would argue what you
[02:26:52] see on YouTube is what you get on Twitch
[02:26:54] that's what I would argue look ask me a
[02:26:56] guide right now hey welcome to my Beta

[02:27:25] just talk in a more structured manner
[02:27:31] yeah it's actually not me it's my it's
[02:27:33] my brother sorry sorry for ruining the
[02:27:36] illusion
[02:27:37] okay swirl Hydro Goro yeah look at this
[02:27:40] rotation
[02:27:41] that is a new team if I've ever seen one
[02:27:54] [ __ ] I miss sushi
[02:28:06] roll Let's Roll
[02:28:16] this team is mud
[02:28:20] I mean it's not that good it's fine but
[02:28:22] that's also the wrong set
[02:28:25] um
[02:28:26] it's fine we'll get for a million soon
[02:28:27] it's fine it didn't have if it had crit
[02:28:30] damage and crit rate I would have been
[02:28:31] mad but if it's just criterated like
[02:28:33] it's fine or one of the two is fine
[02:28:34] we'll get it to plus four just to see
[02:28:36] but yeah
[02:28:48] all right where is it I didn't save it
[02:29:00] this guy's current rate I will scream
[02:29:03] goodness
[02:29:17] oh God this buffoon is still in
[02:29:19] Vermilion again
[02:29:22] listen
[02:29:23] pal listen here bud listen here
[02:29:29] you would have called Bill Gates crazy
[02:29:32] for thinking that he could he could
[02:29:36] Microsoft you would have said oh no oh
[02:29:39] no why would you spend all of our life
[02:29:42] savings investing in the company
[02:29:44] Microsoft you would have called him
[02:29:50] a heretic
[02:29:53] but in the head wouldn't hurt yeah it
[02:29:57] paid off you would have said no Einstein
[02:29:59] I don't think e is equal to m c squared
[02:30:01] but in the end he proves us all wrong
[02:30:05] Pythagoras's Theorem said hey
[02:30:08] a squared plus b squared you know what
[02:30:10] it might equal c squared if the triangle
[02:30:14] is rectangular
[02:30:17] and much like the greats that have come
[02:30:20] before me
[02:30:22] I am saying hey if you dig deep enough
[02:30:25] and push hard enough maybe there will be
[02:30:28] a good Vermilion artifact at the end of
[02:30:30] the tunnel crit damage energy recharge
[02:30:33] maybe this will get criterate
[02:30:42] maybe not but you never know until you
[02:30:45] know and if you can't know without
[02:30:48] trying then why not try
[02:30:51] why not try has anyone told you you like
[02:30:55] the Jungkook of the genshin community
[02:30:56] people say that a lot listen if if you
[02:30:59] don't you miss every shot you don't take
[02:31:02] okay
[02:31:03] you miss every shot you don't take
[02:31:05] you're not gonna dude dude dude let's
[02:31:08] say dude do dude let's say you're like
[02:31:11] oh I met my loving wife or husband
[02:31:15] because I went up to them and I said hi
[02:31:18] okay that could have not happened that
[02:31:21] one moment could have it was the
[02:31:23] trajectory of your entire life I could
[02:31:25] have the perfect child circlet if this
[02:31:28] gets credible right please get out of
[02:31:30] them but I could also not I could be
[02:31:32] like no I'm Gonna Save My artifact XP
[02:31:33] but you don't know until you know you
[02:31:36] gotta try to find out you have to know
[02:31:39] to know
[02:31:42] 3.9
[02:31:45] 3.9 you would have thrown that you would
[02:31:48] have thrown away your wife
[02:31:50] why why
[02:31:52] for a little bit of XP
[02:31:59] and it has energy recharge
[02:32:06] watch this crit rate
[02:32:10] that's okay not every piece is perfect
[02:32:12] if anything the flaws make it perfect
[02:32:16] yeah I would argue with the flaws of
[02:32:19] make this artifact perfect
[02:32:23] I can always tell he's a law student the
[02:32:26] way he talks so much without saying
[02:32:28] anything at all
[02:32:30] yeah what are you saying about that I
[02:32:34] listen
[02:32:35] when I speak
[02:32:39] everyone listens Harvard wants to know
[02:32:42] my location when I speak
[02:32:44] okay okay
[02:32:45] well okay the point the moral of the
[02:32:48] story is still there like you gotta know
[02:32:51] before you you have to try you have to
[02:32:53] try
[02:32:55] dude you can play perfectly and still
[02:32:58] lose you can do everything right and
[02:33:01] still get [ __ ] it happens
[02:33:03] you get dude you could be playing a
[02:33:06] [ __ ] oh like you're gonna be playing
[02:33:07] power and you do everything perfect
[02:33:09] you're like damn I lost me you could be
[02:33:11] in the abyss you predict the perfect
[02:33:13] rotation and then you get RNG it happens
[02:33:15] you don't crit you do everything
[02:33:17] perfectly on Eula and then she doesn't
[02:33:18] crit how is that your fault
[02:33:21] I'm not losing it's all part of the plan
[02:33:24] attaboy positions
[02:33:31] who wants some of this
[02:33:34] bam
[02:33:39] yeah
[02:33:40] you won in the slot machine true we just
[02:33:44] rolled 777 which means the next artifact
[02:33:46] has to be good
[02:33:58] well maybe not
[02:34:01] what is this team as friendship
[02:34:04] it's Crystal it's it's Hydro swirl
[02:34:08] crystallize
[02:34:10] windy wet Rock call it Vermillion
[02:34:12] Hereafter because this man has been here
[02:34:14] for a million dumb times
[02:34:17] that's not true
[02:34:21] how to build visual for tanari just a
[02:34:24] standard aggravate
[02:34:26] because usually do like
[02:34:30] honestly in a time already team here a
[02:34:33] lecture does a lot of damage usually
[02:34:34] like double Electro plus like cos or
[02:34:36] something or like Zhang LI or whatever
[02:34:38] so like
[02:34:40] you typically want your electric
[02:34:41] characters to be built for like full
[02:34:42] damage so you do like attack or em with
[02:34:46] Electro and crit
[02:34:52] swirl Hydro boom
[02:34:56] gotta get particles
[02:35:01] coming through no double down you can
[02:35:04] also do double dendro teams I like
[02:35:05] double Electro more because you can
[02:35:07] swirl it
[02:35:08] but like double danger is also pretty
[02:35:10] good yeah I just think I really like a
[02:35:14] big T with the eye and Fishel
[02:35:23] I spent that did I can't even make
[02:35:25] spending two thousand resin into a video
[02:35:26] anymore because I get nothing good every
[02:35:29] time
[02:35:30] so we're gonna try to save like okay one
[02:35:33] fall tens out whatever the new contents
[02:35:35] it is we're gonna spend all of our
[02:35:36] Fragile on and I already have [ __ ] 69
[02:35:38] plus the battle pass so I'll have like
[02:35:40] 80.
[02:35:42] um and then
[02:35:43] I'll also spend I'm saving all my five
[02:35:45] star artifacts with a strong box so if
[02:35:47] they add like emblem or whatever or
[02:35:49] Vermillion I don't know we'll do that I
[02:35:52] feel like watching your streams helps
[02:35:54] calm my OCD because my worry for your
[02:35:56] sanity is stronger
[02:35:58] dude what the [ __ ] does that mean
[02:36:04] watching my stream helps calm your OCD
[02:36:07] because you're worried for my sanity is
[02:36:10] stronger
[02:36:11] wait let me unlock that artifact dude
[02:36:14] what does that mean
[02:36:17] surely at this point you're just saying
[02:36:18] words
[02:36:20] and catch me
[02:36:36] [ __ ] I didn't talk Fab
[02:36:39] what's up
[02:36:47] let's roll I'm coming through
[02:37:04] press the advantage
[02:37:07] [Music]
[02:37:08] attaboy it's showtime
[02:37:12] yeah
[02:37:13] what kind of team is this okay hear me
[02:37:16] out you use nilu for the Hydra app right
[02:37:18] then you swirl Hydro on sucrose for
[02:37:21] Vanessa thunderer then you pick up a
[02:37:23] hydro Crystal for Petra and then you
[02:37:26] have a hydro windy Jill Rock team
[02:37:29] yeah wet sandstorm
[02:37:36] okay I mean dude this game is actually
[02:37:40] just like limit testing me
[02:37:42] dude how many of these have we gotten
[02:37:47] okay one more
[02:37:54] oh
[02:37:58] oh [ __ ] yo we got like five friendship

[02:38:04] yeah four
[02:38:08] no
[02:38:11] all right cool
[02:38:17] Let's Roll
[02:38:24] all from Vermillion yeah actually
[02:38:27] foreign
[02:38:39] TP
[02:38:46] because I can't go there to condense
[02:38:47] takes too long
[02:38:53] no spaces in our months
[02:38:56] warning your stream helps my ADHD cause
[02:38:59] your fast-paced mindless ramblings is a
[02:39:02] bomb to my own
[02:39:03] foreign
[02:39:07] there's literally nothing mindless about
[02:39:10] anything I say
[02:39:14] okay we're gonna try
[02:39:16] um
[02:39:20] I wanna do Kirara for friendships the
[02:39:22] only character in the scene that doesn't
[02:39:24] need friendship is
[02:39:30] sounds good to me
[02:39:34] look they live in the months okay we're
[02:39:36] gonna try gilded because we can use a
[02:39:38] good gilded Sands or circles
[02:39:41] started farming doing the million it has
[02:39:44] now been 15 months since then and he's
[02:39:47] still farming that domain someone helped
[02:39:50] this you set your autofill as a person
[02:39:52] when talking what okay listen stop don't
[02:39:56] quote me on things I say nothing good
[02:39:58] can come from that I don't remember what
[02:40:00] I say when I'm streaming okay don't
[02:40:02] quote me on things I say because I don't
[02:40:04] know what I say
[02:40:06] a YouTube video sure okay I I try to be
[02:40:09] like educated for that but don't quote
[02:40:12] me on things that I say
[02:40:17] get with swords and shadows
[02:40:20] wait what what [ __ ] weapon am I on
[02:40:25] am I on
[02:40:30] this world [ __ ] okay well I wouldn't
[02:40:33] deposited
[02:40:38] okay let's not talk about this actually
[02:40:41] let's not talk about this
[02:40:45] yeah
[02:40:47] actually what was my ratio
[02:40:50] 40 230 okay
[02:40:52] uh we're gonna take our Aid cutter again
[02:40:54] there you go
[02:40:56] oh because she's a bit better but I feel
[02:40:58] like my ratio usually doesn't look like
[02:40:59] that
[02:41:00] oh we're on disc all that that's our
[02:41:02] yeah is the [ __ ] is the ion
[02:41:07] all right guys
[02:41:19] oh
[02:41:22] no we don't 300. uh wait can I get more
[02:41:29] damage
[02:41:31] do you have more damage on Electro
[02:41:32] somewhere
[02:41:40] surely that's basically 300 right Wows
[02:41:43] do you think streamer got any [ __ ]
[02:41:45] while he was gone
[02:41:47] what the [ __ ] does that mean
[02:41:58] wait how do we lose so much crit rate
[02:42:06] foreign
[02:42:15] dude I just want I just want 300 grit
[02:42:18] damage
[02:42:20] we'll filter by crit damage oh wait I
[02:42:22] want it to be Electro though
[02:42:25] yeah no we don't have more
[02:42:29] whatever it's basically 300 and then we
[02:42:31] gain credit from our old so this one
[02:42:37] I got cleaner skin I couldn't resist
[02:42:39] same boy we should probably play why am
[02:42:41] I not playing I guess I can't level her
[02:42:42] but I can still bring her in
[02:42:44] yeah we'll bring clean after
[02:42:49] okay
[02:42:52] you don't have to spend 10 hours between
[02:42:54] gearing if you just spent all your
[02:42:55] wrestling Vermillion dude unironically
[02:42:59] unironically I feel like I should I'm at
[02:43:02] the point in the game well I've been at
[02:43:03] the point of the game for two years now
[02:43:04] where I should just be farming multiple
[02:43:06] sets for multiple characters so I don't
[02:43:08] have to swap anything but you yeah
[02:43:10] that's less fun I mean I'm kind of doing
[02:43:13] that but also for Millions
[02:43:16] Birds oh that hurts
[02:43:28] your banana quote was my senior quote
[02:43:31] why
[02:43:47] is good on kitchen but you have to have
[02:43:50] a team that
[02:43:51] well honestly most like if you're
[02:43:52] playing aggravate you can keep Electro
[02:43:54] time yeah later is good on her
[02:43:58] but she has a lot of good four stars
[02:43:59] especially because now she scales on em2
[02:44:01] while aggravate is em so like
[02:44:07] like in 1.0 you used to have to use
[02:44:10] [ __ ] wrong core for the [ __ ] base
[02:44:11] attack if you're free to play
[02:44:15] guy I didn't I still didn't swirl
[02:44:16] Electro
[02:44:19] there's one with wind in Cloud I stole
[02:44:22] it and swirl
[02:44:26] whatever he doesn't official
[02:44:35] regret
[02:44:40] how do you make animation so fast I spam
[02:44:42] top rights at skips
[02:44:46] and then watch this look look at how
[02:44:47] fast I can analyze the stats okay bad
[02:44:49] bad
[02:44:52] that could be good crit rate but the
[02:44:54] main set sucked yeah
[02:45:01] this dude know FPS is dropping really no
[02:45:03] I shouldn't maybe that's on your end
[02:45:06] my monitor is 240 FPS but Jensen only
[02:45:08] runs 60.
[02:45:10] so I'm like over capped
[02:45:17] updated you look good I was gonna I
[02:45:19] recorded most of it but then I had to
[02:45:21] leave for like 11 like 10 days for ax so
[02:45:23] I kind of uh wanted to be there for four
[02:45:25] but
[02:45:27] yeah [ __ ] happened so I kind of didn't
[02:45:29] finish it all good
[02:45:43] foreign
[02:45:48] stats are good like Loki HP and ER on a
[02:45:51] [ __ ] D foot is not bad
[02:45:55] but it's also a three-liner
[02:45:59] I don't know if I should keep it no
[02:46:02] cinnamon Jack this is about five months
[02:46:10] should I build a high film yes
[02:46:12] if you're asking that that means you
[02:46:14] have them because it's Banner's not here
[02:46:15] right now so yes [ __ ] build him he's
[02:46:18] good
[02:46:21] I'll hide them all the few DPS
[02:46:23] characters that you can actually like
[02:46:25] recommend pulling for even on like a
[02:46:27] meta standpoint
[02:46:28] despite the fact that like DJ characters
[02:46:30] usually are like kind of playing who you
[02:46:32] like so if you have them use them
[02:46:37] it's very good
[02:46:41] and he's also like it's not just that
[02:46:43] his personal damage is good it's like
[02:46:44] his team damage is really high because
[02:46:46] danger reactions are bro oh is this good
[02:46:48] uh no not really
[02:46:51] his personal damage is good but like he
[02:46:53] has a lot of reaction damage and then
[02:46:54] danger reactions are broken and then
[02:46:55] dendro teams are broken and he has fast
[02:46:57] dandruff
[02:46:59] because on field dendro attack but then
[02:47:01] also his mirrors apply dendro so it's
[02:47:03] like very poggers
[02:47:07] which also means
[02:47:09] he can scale well with future characters
[02:47:12] because then draw on fields he's usually
[02:47:14] the best option
[02:47:20] I kind of like DMC more dude
[02:47:23] that's like
[02:47:24] I'm gonna mold that's like saying
[02:47:44] they don't even do that same thing DMC
[02:47:48] is an off-field support
[02:47:57] the LC is good though
[02:48:06] you think our island is better than
[02:48:07] hutau for legal reasons I will simply
[02:48:10] state that I believe objectively
[02:48:11] speaking dendro reactions and dendro
[02:48:14] teams are better than pyro teams
[02:48:18] that's like saying I'll pass on that
[02:48:21] prime rib I got my baloney sandwich
[02:48:25] also though uh important thing to note
[02:48:26] is that again since Al Haytham isn't
[02:48:29] designed as a hyper carry and his team
[02:48:31] and reaction damage are so good
[02:48:33] he's like very designed as like a strong
[02:48:36] Baseline c0 even without signature
[02:48:39] weapon character whereas I feel like a
[02:48:41] lot of the hyper carries are not
[02:48:43] necessarily dependent but like Get huge
[02:48:45] power spikes with like c0 or R1 to be
[02:48:48] like oh sorry C1 or R1 or like C2 to be
[02:48:51] like competitive with the other
[02:48:53] characters or I'll hide them c0
[02:48:58] he's on field for 15 seconds yeah but
[02:49:00] like
[02:49:02] really good Hydro damage really good
[02:49:04] Electro damage from your other
[02:49:05] characters plus hyper blooms like a huge
[02:49:07] chunk of your damage plus spread but
[02:49:09] that like kind of Buffs his damage but
[02:49:11] yeah and then
[02:49:13] yeah
[02:49:15] without nahida yeah because I have
[02:49:17] nahita available that doesn't mean you
[02:49:18] need a heater
[02:49:26] like um
[02:49:29] sing Cho has really good Hydro app but
[02:49:32] in a lot of Hotel themes I'll play yelon
[02:49:34] too that doesn't mean synchro's High
[02:49:36] Drive isn't good enough just why not
[02:49:37] have more
[02:49:40] and then you trackling in there
[02:49:43] like Nikita is usually the best last
[02:49:45] slot in a Al hyphen team you get more
[02:49:47] spreads more whatever more particles
[02:49:50] damage all that [ __ ] but you don't
[02:49:51] [ __ ] need nahida with them
[02:49:54] like no he does the better addition to
[02:49:55] your account and if you however use it
[02:49:57] like either user in your other team or
[02:49:58] without hyphen but like
[02:50:00] you don't need her with I'll hide them
[02:50:02] you just don't hide them and then like
[02:50:03] anything you do a pure spread team you
[02:50:05] could do a pure like hyperloom team with
[02:50:07] like a little British threads
[02:50:09] where you do like
[02:50:10] hydroelectro anything
[02:50:16] you could also yeah you can also yeah
[02:50:17] yeah if you want another dendro
[02:50:19] A Healer
[02:50:47] it was the most versatile DPS
[02:51:01] [Music]
[02:51:07] in my team I take a look at my bank I
[02:51:11] realize
[02:51:17] I mean yeah she has so many teams
[02:51:20] so that's what you mean by versatile
[02:51:24] every dendro reaction is good so like
[02:51:27] even like virgin's fine like it's not as
[02:51:29] good but like it can be fine so like
[02:51:31] dendro DTS are pretty versatile but like
[02:51:33] chiangling is used in every game
[02:51:37] sure
[02:51:40] like in floors where you need pyro you
[02:51:42] could even add her to like an Ito or a
[02:51:44] shower team or some [ __ ] if you already
[02:51:46] have Bennett there
[02:51:48] or Ryden or child or any Hydro character
[02:51:51] or any like even cryo you could reverse
[02:51:53] mouth quick like quick salt
[02:51:55] [Music]
[02:52:06] now
[02:52:15] too much Theory crafting where is 413.
[02:52:18] yeah literally wants to fly pyro and it
[02:52:21] has Bennett once changling is the last
[02:52:22] slot or a Causeway like you can like
[02:52:24] cause the swirl pyro but yeah
[02:52:54] oh I have no inventory left
[02:52:56] [Music]
[02:53:04] this is gonna happen a lot Chad
[02:53:06] disclaimer because we're trying to keep
[02:53:07] all of our five stars artifacts saved
[02:53:11] for Fontan if we get a new strong box
[02:53:14] your content that way
[02:53:16] [Music]
[02:53:21] minute after minute chamber after
[02:53:24] chamber everybody but I select again
[02:53:29] they say I gotta learn science guys
[02:53:32] already taught me who's PMA for all your
[02:53:35] artifacts they all suck I guess she's
[02:53:37] dead I guess he's broke so stop the
[02:53:39] swiping that's how I made my account
[02:53:41] really good
[02:53:44] should I build Dory do you have another
[02:53:46] character if yes no if you don't then
[02:53:50] yes like if you don't have a cookie or
[02:53:52] any Electro Like official or beta with
[02:53:54] sucrose or Ryden or
[02:53:56] [Music]
[02:53:58] Lisa
[02:54:04] actually it depends this is not bad
[02:54:11] she's fighting aggravate teams or in
[02:54:13] like Euler right in teams
[02:54:22] he doesn't swirl
[02:54:30] [Music]
[02:54:39] I think Lisa is still underrated like if
[02:54:41] you don't have other Electro she's fine
[02:54:43] you can throwing Tails her you can give
[02:54:44] her like five if you need you can it she
[02:54:47] shreds the fence and she can literally
[02:54:49] tails you and she can frog aggravate a
[02:54:51] lot if you're not throwing fails and
[02:54:52] like building damage
[02:54:55] um
[02:54:56] like she's fine
[02:55:00] but if you're gonna like if you want an
[02:55:02] off-field
[02:55:02] alert yeah I wouldn't use her
[02:55:05] well you can't hide from blue with her
[02:55:09] especially on field
[02:55:11] but I'm saying like I would rather have
[02:55:13] like a cookie or even a low kiadori or
[02:55:17] just sucrose
[02:55:30] the ember's attack stands on kaching is
[02:55:32] pretty um dependent they're both really
[02:55:35] good but
[02:55:36] if you're using a heightened weapon is
[02:55:38] what you're asking then I don't see why
[02:55:40] you wouldn't go em size because you get
[02:55:41] bonuses from em on your stat and low
[02:55:45] Vista weapons means that attack Sands
[02:55:47] are worse because the higher base tag
[02:55:49] the more the attack percentage gives you
[02:55:51] so like with Sino for example if you're
[02:55:54] on like Jade sphere attack percent Sans
[02:55:57] can actually be better or like about as
[02:55:59] good whereas usually em sounds would be
[02:56:01] better
[02:56:05] what do you think about ioka comparing
[02:56:07] to dendro and Al hatham
[02:56:10] if you can freeze Ike is really good if
[02:56:12] you can't
[02:56:13] you're still fine but not nearly as good
[02:56:19] I think I like dendro's just really good
[02:56:21] right now and very consistent but like
[02:56:23] The Meta changes a lot like or at least
[02:56:24] this 12 changes a lot
[02:56:32] remember help comes first
[02:56:37] income
[02:56:41] what do you think about Miko Ryden Sarah
[02:56:45] Jean waifu team I mean that's certainly
[02:56:47] a team it's fine right and yeah is good
[02:56:50] in the oven and Nemo
[02:56:52] or like right inside like you would
[02:56:54] probably I mean it's fine like you would
[02:56:56] replace one of the electrodes for like
[02:56:57] Bennett or something but it's fine
[02:57:00] it's not great but it's fine
[02:57:13] if you have a ride in C2 wheel she'll
[02:57:16] probably just hyper carry you
[02:57:29] upgrade em Sans yes sir
[02:57:37] yes sir
[02:57:38] reporting for Duty sir
[02:57:48] uh uh I mean
[02:58:02] I mean that's I'm not really that
[02:58:07] hit
[02:58:10] wait do you guys think I still have
[02:58:12] [ __ ] sigils
[02:58:16] what I do what the [ __ ]
[02:58:18] sheesh plus 20K
[02:58:21] thumb
[02:58:23] well how much more do I have I feel like
[02:58:25] I'm rich
[02:58:45] how about Inazuma sigils I got all of
[02:58:47] them
[02:58:52] [Music]
[02:58:55] how's ayaka yalon hutau and shanha
[02:58:59] okay how do I break the news to you all
[02:59:02] the characters you named are good
[02:59:03] they're all good characters they're
[02:59:05] great you should be happy you have them
[02:59:07] but you probably want to split them into
[02:59:08] two teams because number one you have no
[02:59:10] healer and number two who tau yalon is a
[02:59:13] team and ayakashan has a team basically
[02:59:17] so I would just like split them into two
[02:59:18] they have two teams
[02:59:42] without saying shows the team sing Joe's
[02:59:43] better than yolan in uh with if it's
[02:59:46] your only Hydro with
[02:59:48] um
[02:59:48] hutau but ideally you run both but even
[02:59:51] if you can only run yolan she can still
[02:59:53] kind of keep up like you can't do like
[02:59:55] two normals into a charge anymore or you
[02:59:57] have too much pyro but if you do like N1
[03:00:00] uh just N1 and then charge attack like
[03:00:02] n1c
[03:00:03] uh yolan can like mostly keep up unless
[03:00:06] you get like like it's like a bit
[03:00:09] inconsistent because like you can like
[03:00:11] get too much power sometimes but usually
[03:00:12] it's fine you keep up and then if you're
[03:00:15] like actually into it there's like
[03:00:16] probably a whole like
[03:00:19] written post about it on like kutamins
[03:00:22] so
[03:00:30] here
[03:00:33] clubs high the birds taking the turn for
[03:00:38] the better
[03:00:40] can you grab all the Chalmers from the
[03:00:42] hoyovers area no but I bought a [ __ ]
[03:00:44] on a shower merge from artists which
[03:00:46] honestly is even more basic because I
[03:00:49] mean I already have a lot of the
[03:00:50] official uh child merch I have a Fang
[03:00:53] pre-ordered me the statue I have the
[03:00:55] Xiao keyboard I have the big ass child
[03:00:57] plushie that's in my room and I have
[03:00:59] like a bunch of Shopkins but then I I
[03:01:01] also like the prints are so [ __ ] sick
[03:01:06] like there's a bunch of shower prints
[03:01:08] literally on the ground next to me
[03:01:14] thoughts on Cujo Sara overload
[03:01:19] why would you use those words in that
[03:01:22] order why
[03:01:29] clearly you meant surely you meant to
[03:01:32] say something else
[03:01:33] mine decided
[03:01:37] okay that was fun
[03:01:50] yeah I do think I want to play a bit of
[03:01:53] Sorrow I want to try Sarah aggravate
[03:01:57] I know it's like a little copium but I
[03:01:59] don't know I feel like I haven't played
[03:02:00] it
[03:02:01] there's a few like weird teams I want to
[03:02:03] try but I haven't got around to it
[03:02:05] not overload though I don't know
[03:02:10] play Glee
[03:02:13] we actually played piano randomizer once
[03:02:15] on Prototype Amber
[03:02:23] wait are her animations different
[03:02:24] it's a legendary skin right I feel like
[03:02:26] I paid full price
[03:02:31] yeah whatever
[03:02:33] no it's four star oh whatever
[03:02:53] seems like an emergency
[03:02:56] I do but it's like level two
[03:03:00] nowhere to hide
[03:03:02] hey
[03:03:08] why is Moto Geo so trash uh it's like
[03:03:13] it depends on the content like Ito
[03:03:16] Goro's fine
[03:03:19] he's no girls fine it's just usually
[03:03:21] your last two slots
[03:03:24] that's pretty good
[03:03:31] you feel girls fine and then Albedo
[03:03:34] could be a good battery and Zhang Lee if
[03:03:36] your pillar's hitting can be a good
[03:03:37] battery with some rest red it's just
[03:03:39] like if you add a fourth Geo there your
[03:03:41] team's gotta cooked and then you don't
[03:03:43] have enough like yeah Geo can brute
[03:03:45] force them Shields but you also can
[03:03:47] re-force every Shield like current like
[03:03:49] 12-3 is kind of ass
[03:03:51] or 12-1
[03:03:56] um so you kind of want like other things
[03:03:59] there and then it's like crystallize
[03:04:00] doesn't really do [ __ ]
[03:04:10] now you're testing my patience
[03:04:14] okay
[03:04:22] let me find a Scara freeze diona and
[03:04:24] Waterboy who should I put uh
[03:04:27] if you want okay so if you don't have
[03:04:29] too much crit rate you could do Rosaria
[03:04:31] and then you get basically infinite crit
[03:04:33] rate because Rosario gives you criterate
[03:04:35] then cry residents give you crit rate
[03:04:36] and then you're just chilling
[03:04:51] you are not welcome if you don't need a
[03:04:53] Healer I kind of like Layla I'm better
[03:04:56] there
[03:05:00] feet of light
[03:05:01] but I guess that one gives you stamina
[03:05:03] thing but it doesn't if you're playing
[03:05:05] Century you're not all attacking
[03:05:06] anything
[03:05:16] when do you play yo can you die
[03:05:25] wait freaking call me to show up me too
[03:05:27] man well I already have her but as a
[03:05:29] kokomi nation uh uh supporter and
[03:05:32] founder dollars on Mercer Comey
[03:05:37] who blooms in a new team out of stock
[03:05:39] yamah and it depends on your team but
[03:05:40] you're just a hydro character like the
[03:05:42] other Hydro so like Barbara or kokomi
[03:05:44] like sometimes it could be like the
[03:05:45] dendro like yeah like if it's like it
[03:05:48] depends but usually it's your hydro so
[03:05:49] you'll do like
[03:05:52] um
[03:05:54] like let's say Nikita on field and then
[03:05:56] you'll have like a off an off-field
[03:05:58] Barber or could call me on fully um
[03:06:09] let me get other kokomi guide yeah I
[03:06:11] think so
[03:06:21] [Music]
[03:06:27] when are you getting also dude I saw
[03:06:30] like a I don't know who was but I saw
[03:06:31] another [ __ ] okay I know tearless or
[03:06:34] a meme at this point but it's not random
[03:06:35] deer list and like it looked like at
[03:06:37] first it looked a bit based and then I I
[03:06:39] kept looking I kept noticing things that
[03:06:42] were tilting me and then I saw Barbara
[03:06:44] in like d tier dude Barbara's actually
[03:06:47] good why do people hate Barbara like
[03:06:49] yeah she's the worst kokomi but that's
[03:06:52] still good you're a [ __ ] free healer
[03:06:55] with a catalyst
[03:06:56] who can also just [ __ ] proc like
[03:06:59] Bloom like for you or give you hydro app
[03:07:02] to get blooms
[03:07:04] even in a team where you wouldn't want
[03:07:06] her like let's say you're playing like
[03:07:07] Quicken
[03:07:09] kaching you could still have a slow
[03:07:11] Hydro like Barbara and then the ring
[03:07:13] will just give you like a little bit of
[03:07:15] Bloom damage for free
[03:07:17] or hyperbloom I guess because like
[03:07:19] you're stacking em so you can get
[03:07:20] hyperboons
[03:07:23] because cooldown yeah but your C2 or you
[03:07:25] could go like you could go sack in a
[03:07:27] nearly Bloom team but you also have C2
[03:07:29] and then like who cares you're a Healer
[03:07:30] plus you have some Hydro
[03:07:37] um
[03:07:41] doesn't do one
[03:07:45] travel kitchen skill or normal and it's
[03:07:48] cute enough wait what what do you mean
[03:07:50] is Q enough
[03:07:51] no level all your talents on kitchen
[03:07:56] skill and bursts are more important
[03:07:57] though
[03:07:59] like the kitchen sound priority depends
[03:08:01] on how you use her
[03:08:02] because I remember like physical kitchen
[03:08:04] that would like spam charge packs wanted
[03:08:05] to like level her normals and stuff but
[03:08:07] I feel like when I play her in aggravate
[03:08:09] you normal and chargeback less so like
[03:08:11] it's still important
[03:08:12] and like all three are pretty important
[03:08:13] but like I I prioritize a skill and
[03:08:16] burst
[03:08:17] no there's a problem
[03:08:29] 2023 dude she's good what are you
[03:08:31] talking about
[03:08:32] do you see that this isn't even a
[03:08:34] [ __ ] dude this thing's good
[03:08:48] that could be good I mean bad set but
[03:08:52] boss champ
[03:09:03] sorry yeah actually wait yeah yeah in
[03:09:06] the aggravate I low-key brain farted
[03:09:08] normals are
[03:09:11] like as good I could look it up but I'm
[03:09:14] normals are like really good in
[03:09:16] aggravate because it's high because you
[03:09:18] attack a lot so you find a lot of
[03:09:19] Electro so you want to Stack it but I
[03:09:21] feel like iPlayer more quick swap than
[03:09:23] you're supposed to because every time I
[03:09:24] [ __ ] play kaching it's literally
[03:09:26] skill and you swirl Electro so you apply
[03:09:29] dendro then you go back and you skill
[03:09:31] then you Auto one to reverse and then
[03:09:33] your skills already all cool down and
[03:09:35] then I end up never Auto attacking
[03:09:36] because enemies are dead but like in
[03:09:38] theory if the enemies Aren't Dead you
[03:09:39] can all attack more so normal attacks
[03:09:41] are more important
[03:09:44] thank you
[03:09:46] like Dragon Bird yeah
[03:09:55] but I could
[03:09:56] check the thing
[03:10:06] yeah
[03:10:08] yep
[03:10:12] anyways what I want to talk about
[03:10:15] um
[03:10:17] oh yeah dude
[03:10:19] I was so okay listen
[03:10:22] I was so [ __ ] tilted okay ax is super
[03:10:24] fun okay everything about it very fun
[03:10:26] well not everything about it it was like
[03:10:28] Omega packed and like some of it was
[03:10:30] Manga but
[03:10:32] most of it was fun but dude going there
[03:10:35] I literally okay every single fight
[03:10:38] every flight was delayed every single
[03:10:42] fight was turbo fun Okay and like I
[03:10:45] couldn't even book one like they were
[03:10:47] all sold out but I had one that I booked
[03:10:48] like weeks in advance so I was chilling
[03:10:52] but for some reason it decided to leave
[03:10:54] early without without a warning but like
[03:10:56] that's fine because I go to the airport
[03:10:58] like two two hours in advance I usually
[03:11:00] leave wherever I am three hours in
[03:11:02] advance an hour to get there to give
[03:11:04] myself ample time and then two hours in
[03:11:05] advance uh to be there okay so I'm not
[03:11:10] gonna name any names but a certain
[03:11:12] cosplayer artist that I was going with
[03:11:14] needed some extra time to pack so I was
[03:11:16] waiting I'm a patient man no big deal
[03:11:17] follow the win
[03:11:19] the left like two hours 45 ish two and a
[03:11:22] half hours before the flight so we had
[03:11:25] time we were 30 minutes away from the
[03:11:27] airport a local fight not even
[03:11:29] International you should be there an
[03:11:30] hour early we're gonna be there two
[03:11:31] hours early
[03:11:33] the Uber that's whose ETA was 30 minutes
[03:11:36] and I did that Uber this morning I just
[03:11:38] landed again same Uber that's normally
[03:11:40] 30 minutes and it was was two hours and
[03:11:43] 15.
[03:11:45] I don't know how there was [ __ ]
[03:11:47] traffic all throughout Manhattan all
[03:11:50] throughout the entire [ __ ] journey
[03:11:52] and the Uber driver decided to [ __ ]
[03:11:54] take his tire all good
[03:11:56] still tipped them 2 hours 15. so when we
[03:12:01] got there the fight apparently departed
[03:12:03] early so we were [ __ ] [ __ ] and it
[03:12:07] wasn't even like rush hour it was like
[03:12:09] okay I don't remember what time it was
[03:12:11] but I know it wasn't like what the peak
[03:12:13] Rush Hour was I think there's like
[03:12:14] accidents or something I don't know man
[03:12:16] it was like 2 P.M
[03:12:21] and then after that every [ __ ] flight
[03:12:24] was booked like fully booked to the
[03:12:27] point where I spent hours just chilling
[03:12:28] in the [ __ ]
[03:12:29] airport until it was like 8 p.m and I
[03:12:32] was tilted so I tried to book the last
[03:12:33] slot of a Delta flight that was like
[03:12:35] [ __ ] 3K or something for two people
[03:12:37] it was like stupid and I was like
[03:12:39] whatever I'll just like get a refund
[03:12:40] like I'll contest it or something later
[03:12:41] and it got sold out when I tried to buy
[03:12:43] it so I ended up like we have to go to
[03:12:46] like some like discount site like ticket
[03:12:49] father.com or some [ __ ] and it's like
[03:12:52] sucks and I didn't trust it
[03:12:53] it worked so we ended up instead of
[03:12:56] doing a direct five hour flight we went
[03:12:57] to [ __ ] San Francisco first and then
[03:13:00] San Francisco there
[03:13:02] but we saved money
[03:13:04] so it worked
[03:13:06] but it was scary and I felt like it took
[03:13:08] like it was like an overnight like
[03:13:10] layover [ __ ] so yeah it was not fun
[03:13:14] yeah no it was not fun
[03:13:17] it was supposed to be direct
[03:13:20] and then on the way back
[03:13:22] no the way back was chill actually
[03:13:28] it's pretty good
[03:13:29] actually no it can't what am I doing
[03:13:34] how long is the drive to New okay we did
[03:13:36] I did one hour flight to New York and
[03:13:38] then direct to LA
[03:13:40] that was the path
[03:13:44] now I booked on Google initially the
[03:13:47] first booking was fine but the second
[03:13:48] one I used like some like Groupon [ __ ]
[03:13:51] and I actually carried
[03:14:03] what's the song uh pink venom
[03:14:16] I'm actually out of [ __ ] Crystal
[03:14:18] flies
[03:14:25] and I'll hide them should I pull for
[03:14:26] Miss splitter
[03:14:28] no why the [ __ ]
[03:14:32] let's get a Jade cutter
[03:14:35] actually no don't get it what am I
[03:14:37] saying don't get a weapon dude [ __ ]
[03:14:39] useful you're online and then craft the
[03:14:41] [ __ ] iron sting
[03:15:00] wow
[03:15:05] you're not welcome look at his lines raw
[03:15:07] R5 compared to Jade cutter uh worse but
[03:15:10] I don't know how much
[03:15:11] for the exact number I would check
[03:15:13] either my video or like kitchen Mains
[03:15:16] wow I'm gonna google it for you because
[03:15:17] I'm such a nice guy cyox kaching
[03:15:24] now we got a
[03:15:27] uh weapons and then there's a weapon
[03:15:29] ranking oh bad chest
[03:15:32] whoa made by zajab 77 lions or R5 110
[03:15:36] percent
[03:15:37] I don't know the exact time this assumes
[03:15:38] though I forget because it's [ __ ]
[03:15:39] seven months ago but and then 126 so a
[03:15:42] bit worse well at a decent amount worse
[03:15:44] but
[03:15:46] if you have a line through R5 you know
[03:15:48] you might not want to spend money on the
[03:15:50] new level you're fine
[03:15:59] yeah but aggravation exactly aggravate
[03:16:01] shouldn't have any uptime problems
[03:16:03] because like you're literally just
[03:16:05] keeping a quick and Aura on enemies so
[03:16:06] you're basically the uptime of lion's
[03:16:08] roar is like near 100.
[03:16:11] foreign
[03:16:28] cutter no one's signature weapon last
[03:16:30] time I had a rerun was Albedo's Banner
[03:16:32] wait really that's [ __ ] funny
[03:16:36] it's just good it's a [ __ ] statistic
[03:16:39] this is good
[03:16:45] that's funny
[03:16:48] dude Albedo is [ __ ] best weapon by a
[03:16:52] decent amount is locked behind an event
[03:16:54] it's actually sag
[03:16:57] I don't know why there's no other way to
[03:16:58] get it it should be like event and then
[03:17:00] if you can't get it there's like a way
[03:17:01] to craft it or like it's like expensive
[03:17:03] like it costs like something
[03:17:08] this could be good
[03:17:11] oh
[03:17:21] yeah they could put it on standard
[03:17:23] Banner but I feel like there could they
[03:17:24] could make something interesting like
[03:17:26] they don't have to rerun events but they
[03:17:28] could do something where it's like you
[03:17:29] are not welcome here either like an
[03:17:31] event currency or like
[03:17:33] you can trade like dream solvents and
[03:17:36] like something else like something
[03:17:37] that's like rare to get it I don't know
[03:17:41] all right
[03:17:46] or put in like this exactly yeah you
[03:17:47] could put in like the star glitter shop
[03:17:49] if you really want to like
[03:17:52] I don't know
[03:17:56] Salford Mora yeah it could be that I
[03:17:58] think it would have to be a stupid high
[03:17:59] amount of Morrow though because like if
[03:18:00] they want it to be like a limited time
[03:18:02] like feels exclusive they'd have to make
[03:18:04] like
[03:18:05] a couple million
[03:18:13] okay maybe not 20 million I'm not I'm
[03:18:16] not spending 20 million more on my
[03:18:18] Albedo I would rather swipe
[03:18:26] foreign
[03:18:29] you're funnier when you do Vermillion
[03:18:32] okay you know what you cannot you
[03:18:33] actually can't argue with that logic so
[03:18:36] I don't want to let the fan down we're
[03:18:38] gonna go do Vermillion oh wait
[03:18:41] yo yo yo not bad actually really good
[03:18:45] 7.8 3.1 ER
[03:18:47] M yo
[03:18:54] and
[03:18:57] this could have been Echoes if we were
[03:18:59] farming Vermillion
[03:19:06] celebrate too early classic okay I'm
[03:19:08] gonna give you a 10 minute timeout
[03:19:09] because in advance I know you're gonna
[03:19:10] be looking like a clown when this only
[03:19:12] rolls [ __ ] so ribosomato
[03:19:16] we will all be laughing at you when this
[03:19:18] only rolls crit
[03:19:19] point and laugh chat
[03:19:28] wait where is it I'm so used to going to
[03:19:31] The Echoes or the Vermillion
[03:19:37] is in that room
[03:19:42] yeah I can't go down right now Saj
[03:19:46] well I'll get you a good artifact
[03:19:48] instead

[03:19:54] I'll give you a hundred
[03:19:59] okay one miss it's not bad it's very
[03:20:02] tilting that it missed but because
[03:20:04] there's three Goods to add So in theory

[03:20:08] dollar only flat pressure

[03:20:13] okay
[03:20:15] that's already good well I don't know
[03:20:17] what Jake said like another yeah but
[03:20:18] this is really good so far
[03:20:25] damage or crit rate would be great ER
[03:20:27] would be okay because a lot of deeper
[03:20:29] characters want ER
[03:20:34] but I think we got crit
[03:20:50] foreign
[03:20:58] I'm getting bad vibes in my chat I just

[03:22:26] I still like the Hugo one
[03:22:33] the [ __ ] is this
[03:22:36] adventuring as in business you always
[03:22:39] have to seize the opportunity we did we
[03:22:42] got it today
[03:22:43] okay let me look Crystal flies really
[03:22:45] fast
[03:22:50] not Vermillion actually true why uh why
[03:22:54] do you have to ruin every moment like I
[03:22:56] feel like I can't be happy even when I
[03:22:58] get something good it's like oh it's not
[03:23:00] Vermillion and then I
[03:23:04] can't be happy anymore
[03:23:15] foreign
[03:23:20] Goro if he ever gets a whenever Ito gets
[03:23:22] a rerun Gore will be on the banner so
[03:23:24] you're fine
[03:23:26] or you could just do shangling Bennett
[03:23:28] sing show
[03:23:31] not Geo
[03:23:39] if only glad worked with charge and
[03:23:41] plunge wait it does work with charge
[03:23:44] wait no I'm trolling
[03:23:46] it's normal it's with Claymore that I
[03:23:49] worked never mind
[03:23:51] why does that work with plunge though
[03:23:53] why does nothing work with lunge
[03:23:55] actually reminiscence does
[03:23:57] oh
[03:24:08] chat listen
[03:24:10] what does chat want right attack
[03:24:13] damage
[03:24:15] okay we can get attacked Bennett
[03:24:18] thrilling tails
[03:24:20] no blasts
[03:24:21] Miller lith
[03:24:25] Etc
[03:24:26] foreign
[03:24:31] that's cool
[03:24:33] so we got damn it 50 damage percent
[03:24:35] after using our skill
[03:24:37] that could be good oh but socks you lose
[03:24:39] 15 energy that's actually a lot yeah it
[03:24:42] is
[03:24:42] yeah it is
[03:24:44] but what if we had a weapon that could
[03:24:46] not only give us energy but give us
[03:24:48] attack based on our energy
[03:24:52] that would be a pretty cool weapon if
[03:24:54] that were to exist
[03:24:55] what if it matches his pants
[03:24:58] that would be a sign
[03:25:02] what if we do engulfing lightning
[03:25:06] for reminiscent Xiao we get attack and
[03:25:09] energy for the diminishing returns
[03:25:12] and then we also get damage percent
[03:25:15] for the diminishing gains
[03:25:19] let me cook chat
[03:25:21] I have never asked guys to let me cook
[03:25:24] as much as I'm asking you to let me cook
[03:25:27] right now just let me cook and then you
[03:25:30] can taste the cooking it'll be free I
[03:25:32] promise
[03:25:34] it's on the house cooking
[03:25:37] foreign
[03:25:52] 160 ER 2200 attack and we get more when
[03:25:57] we alt more energy
[03:26:02] no clear weapon
[03:26:07] let me cook chat
[03:26:10] I think we need a bit of occur damage
[03:26:12] give me a bit of damage here
[03:26:13] um
[03:26:15] laughs
[03:26:23] actually I think this is fine
[03:26:31] yeah it's fine
[03:26:34] ER Sans
[03:26:37] it's not a bad idea actually
[03:26:39] I don't have an ER sath on reminiscence
[03:26:44] um
[03:26:50] okay maybe not
[03:26:59] wait what's the difference in attack
[03:27:01] we had 2200 okay
[03:27:05] oh we have 20 attack on this too so it
[03:27:07] would have been worse actually never
[03:27:09] mind
[03:27:11] are you ever gonna Alt
[03:27:16] more when you Alt
[03:27:18] so what do you mean how am I gonna watch
[03:27:20] literally watch
[03:27:27] [ __ ] it we'll play Dale
[03:27:30] literally watch there's a watch
[03:27:39] Triple A Nemo but it's fine yeah
[03:27:43] Charles and generally particles during
[03:27:45] his old okay but listen
[03:27:47] okay gain 30 ER for 12 seconds after
[03:27:50] using your burst right what if we do a
[03:27:52] Daya classic jump cancel where we burst
[03:27:54] on ciao swap out swap back then we still
[03:27:58] have the boosted ER
[03:28:03] thought of that
[03:28:06] ever thought of that
[03:28:10] wait actually
[03:28:11] how does the snapshotting work so you
[03:28:13] know how with Xiao you skilled in your
[03:28:16] alt right so you skill then you Alt
[03:28:21] would this 30 ER instantly proc and then
[03:28:25] you get all the energy
[03:28:28] does that make sense
[03:28:29] like
[03:28:40] yeah surely it works but our first skill
[03:28:43] we can't alt because [ __ ] uh
[03:28:45] reminiscence so we need to like skill
[03:28:47] once then skill after okay wait wait I
[03:28:50] got this let me get my help
[03:28:52] what
[03:28:55] let me get better let me get better
[03:28:58] let me go let's Light It Up
[03:29:13] dude a hundred chaotic golfing we
[03:29:16] actually cooked
[03:29:18] here
[03:29:23] dude we actually are cooking also the ER
[03:29:26] in our burst helps with like the
[03:29:28] off-field supports
[03:29:37] wait what wait oh it's like where is
[03:29:40] this what is it called
[03:29:48] our show is still four percent
[03:29:51] he's top four percent on four
[03:29:54] reminiscents
[03:29:55] engulfing lightning
[03:30:00] wait what happened wait what category is
[03:30:02] he in
[03:30:04] okay whatever I don't know uh oh it's in
[03:30:07] the Homer category
[03:30:09] that's [ __ ] funny
[03:30:20] dude we're actually cooking
[03:30:22] do you think this website does it factor
[03:30:24] in how reminiscence like works like on
[03:30:26] average
[03:30:33] has 1.5 crew Valley from being ranked
[03:30:36] one no that can't be true
[03:30:37] there's no way
[03:30:41] there's also probably a lot of attacks
[03:30:43] and sub stats that are in there
[03:30:45] okay watch this we're gonna get our alt
[03:30:47] back
[03:30:49] dude look at the energy we're getting
[03:30:55] worthless and that was a low Plunge
[03:31:02] dude I'm telling you this is the future
[03:31:04] it's actually the future
[03:31:09] actually the future
[03:31:11] of Xiao
[03:31:15] do this in Abyss okay sure if you think
[03:31:18] oh wait I'm at floor eight okay maybe
[03:31:21] not today
[03:31:28] I'm lucky
[03:31:34] no don't compare
[03:31:41] I mean okay to be fair
[03:31:45] we could probably do like Jade's fear
[03:31:47] but then ER substance and then triple
[03:31:49] enemo like we could do like Cosmo far
[03:31:51] because Kozo is a good last lot anyways
[03:31:55] come on
[03:31:58] [Music]
[03:32:15] let's go see this

[03:32:36] tear
[03:32:44] s
[03:33:09] this is also [ __ ] engulfing though
[03:33:12] what if we say [ __ ] the ER
[03:33:19] [Music]

[03:33:59] emblem
[03:34:03] except we won't get our burst back ever
[03:34:05] but we could do like three of them at a
[03:34:07] time
[03:34:12] okay far was on with Fab and then kazua
[03:34:15] there's literally no way we don't get it
[03:34:16] actually no way unless you have like
[03:34:18] zero yar
[03:34:22] actually let me take that back it has to
[03:34:24] be C6 powers on
[03:34:29] [ __ ] Lament
[03:34:48] yeah I think I think golfing is the wave
[03:34:50] though
[03:35:11] if we catch I mean we could the effect
[03:35:15] doesn't do anything but it's funny
[03:35:28] okay let's go to Scara

[03:35:50] Skyward spine
[03:35:52] or Skyward anything except maybe harp
[03:35:54] it's always five
[03:36:00] guys eight months appreciate it eight
[03:36:03] months of momentum characters
[03:36:09] I didn't [ __ ] it okay maybe the build
[03:36:12] doesn't work if you missed three skills
[03:36:14] that's not my fault though
[03:36:17] will carry us
[03:36:30] everybody stand tears of the storm

[03:37:13] those are the most
[03:37:18] Apostles use wander as a support uh
[03:37:22] uh no
[03:37:25] I mean you could use them forward that's
[03:37:27] it and then just Auto attack once
[03:37:30] like thrilling Tales forward Destin and
[03:37:33] then just Auto attack
[03:37:35] and then swap
[03:37:37] I guess
[03:37:43] it's still better than Dale
[03:37:45] sorry
[03:37:50] reality
[03:37:52] is pain
[03:37:54] I mean it is the bird has inventor and
[03:37:57] throwing Tales are objectively better
[03:37:59] than the entire character of Dale

[03:38:59] that wasn't my fault though that was
[03:39:01] just a game
[03:39:03] okay watch this watch a showcase
[03:39:13] engulfing lightning Chow
[03:39:16] yeah
[03:39:18] can I actually showcased on wait that
[03:39:20] was one seven one seven one seven wait
[03:39:21] that was actually sick and now perfect
[03:39:24] drop because perfect number boom
[03:39:28] wait there we go yo where's
[03:39:32] wait look at this [ __ ] wait
[03:39:35] ER says oh unlucky but still
[03:39:38] wait that actually worked let me roll it
[03:39:40] roll it we got a set and a [ __ ]
[03:39:42] Billet only two tails though
[03:39:48] thumb
[03:39:49] what the [ __ ] can't wait
[03:39:52] let me roll it
[03:39:59] make one seven one seven one seven in a
[03:40:02] mode why I mean okay if this only rolls
[03:40:04] crit I'll make a remote brush slide
[03:40:06] slime
[03:40:10] not bad I just default left
[03:40:13] I reset the factory settings
[03:40:29] one miss is fine
[03:40:33] 666. manka
[03:40:56] I mean
[03:40:58] at least it looks even six two six two
[03:41:01] six three
[03:41:09] okay
[03:41:12] [ __ ] you slice it does it does look nice
[03:41:15] it is visually compelling
[03:41:24] um
[03:41:27] size 16 it what's the point
[03:41:30] what even is that like what am I even
[03:41:31] looking for
[03:41:42] did my [ __ ] stereo addicted ass was
[03:41:45] expecting a like a something at Plus 15.
[03:41:49] I mean this could be good I guess
[03:41:55] right it could be fine
[03:41:57] I don't know why you guys are typing
[03:41:58] copium
[03:41:59] if it gets crew damage that's a 1010
[03:42:01] piece
[03:42:02] dude speaking of Titan I saw him at ax
[03:42:04] he was like he walked out to me with a
[03:42:07] legit I cannot make this up he was in a
[03:42:10] Kali cosplay first of all you are coping
[03:42:13] good cosplay second of all he wanted to
[03:42:16] do like a walkie-talkie and he was like
[03:42:18] I lost my phone I'm like what happened
[03:42:21] he said it was in my bag at a rave and I
[03:42:23] lost my bang or like someone stole it
[03:42:25] why was it in a bag oh great damage wait
[03:42:29] that's good
[03:42:30] yo that's okay the 63 flat defense is
[03:42:33] sad but this is still good
[03:42:36] Am I Ever Gonna use it no but it's
[03:42:39] pretty good
[03:42:41] pretty good
[03:42:49] okay I probably have a glad feather
[03:42:51] that's worse than that let's look let's
[03:42:52] look
[03:42:54] um
[03:42:55] oh the [ __ ]
[03:42:59] wait let's look at her glad
[03:43:01] let's see what it's worth
[03:43:04] uh this one is 14 15 14 10. so 10 14 10
[03:43:10] 14.
[03:43:12] 12 14 okay well this one has attack
[03:43:15] percent though this one doesn't so this
[03:43:16] one's worse
[03:43:20] even though that crit value is a bit
[03:43:21] higher on this one
[03:43:23] it's like 1.8 or one point
[03:43:26] because that's 0.2 so 1.6
[03:43:30] they're basically the same
[03:43:32] um
[03:43:34] ah
[03:43:38] HP for ayato okay but I have Echoes
[03:43:40] right though
[03:43:43] I don't need this much glad surely
[03:43:48] foddering 34 crit value okay but we're
[03:43:51] about to get 50 watch 40 crit value or a
[03:43:54] money back
[03:44:03] wait wait
[03:44:10] maybe today is our lucky day not for
[03:44:12] Vermillion but for everything else
[03:44:15] Paul strap ball strap
[03:44:19] another crit rate and I change my pants
[03:44:21] because that would be what
[03:44:24] oh
[03:44:26] wait that's good
[03:44:28] wait I actually get actually good what
[03:44:31] the [ __ ]
[03:44:33] well I've had this piece for like a year
[03:44:35] I just never leveled it
[03:44:37] or like I guess when stereo came out
[03:44:39] wait what the hell
[03:44:43] dude
[03:44:45] can you imagine if Xiao still is too
[03:44:46] glad dude wait how much Green Valley is
[03:44:49] this 16 times 2 is 32 plus 7.8 basically
[03:44:53] round up it's like 40.
[03:44:55] it's more than 40.
[03:44:57] thumb
[03:45:04] 40.4
[03:45:07] now see there you go quick math
[03:45:14] it's actually
[03:45:15] good [ __ ] and it's kind of more so it's
[03:45:18] like wait what the [ __ ] wait I have a
[03:45:23] it's also better than it looks because
[03:45:25] having a [ __ ] ton of crit rate can help
[03:45:27] for some ratios or you really need that
[03:45:29] right like having a even spread of
[03:45:32] critical damage is good but sometimes
[03:45:34] your build is like [ __ ] I just need
[03:45:36] criterate or [ __ ] I just need crit
[03:45:37] damage
[03:45:38] what are your pieces bro I have been
[03:45:40] artifact farming since AR 40 40. no 45
[03:45:45] no 40 literally 40. it's been like three
[03:45:48] years
[03:45:50] the market is a tier one
[03:45:58] if only I was still on two piece two
[03:46:00] piece man
[03:46:04] let's see actually
[03:46:07] I really like this child build I think
[03:46:09] this is the future by the way I think
[03:46:11] this is I think look don't let me cook
[03:46:13] for too long but I actually dig that
[03:46:16] dude four of an Essence a golfing okay I
[03:46:19] actually think this is like the I I'm a
[03:46:21] trendsetter
[03:46:23] let's go back let's go back
[03:46:27] it does make sense it literally does
[03:46:33] okay let me go to these two piece give
[03:46:34] me a second let me cook for like two
[03:46:36] seconds
[03:46:36] let me cook for literally two seconds
[03:46:59] are you letting me crochet yes or no
[03:47:09] no are you letting me cook or no
[03:47:12] 98 toy
[03:47:15] cook yes no
[03:47:24] wait this is kind of stupid this is kind
[03:47:27] of ridiculous
[03:47:28] ER I'm C1 with a [ __ ] C6 farazan and
[03:47:31] I could go probably cause I don't need
[03:47:33] ER it's a waste of a stat
[03:47:40] but this is probably still better
[03:47:41] because it has 5.8
[03:47:44] and that's one on one
[03:47:53] wait this is actually perfect one one
[03:47:55] then we have dude and then because if we
[03:47:57] get the crit card in Abyss you don't
[03:47:59] want to go over 92 credit because the
[03:48:01] cricket in Abyss well it doesn't matter
[03:48:02] but the crew card in Abyss is eight
[03:48:03] percent so 91.4 plus eight that's
[03:48:06] basically a hundred and two two two one
[03:48:10] one one they're actually perfect
[03:48:13] and then our attack is kind of clickbait
[03:48:15] because we have double power on our team
[03:48:16] but yeah whatever
[03:48:28] I don't actually know if um this is the
[03:48:32] right circle of tease though because
[03:48:33] it's kind of not like insane
[03:48:37] like this one's better well I guess it's
[03:48:39] crit rate dude Loki or Vermillion
[03:48:41] circuit's good
[03:48:44] this circle is actually good
[03:48:50] Chicago I probably didn't refresh it's
[03:48:52] probably not that good
[03:48:54] I don't know actually it might be good
[03:48:57] but I feel like our vermilion's better
[03:49:03] wait why does it think I have 69 crit
[03:49:05] rate
[03:49:06] do I no I don't [ __ ]
[03:49:08] I guess it's an update
[03:49:14] I don't know if it update or not but it
[03:49:15] says number 54 Jade that's what 2B
[03:49:18] stupids this is competing with
[03:49:19] Vermillion but I don't think it updated
[03:49:21] or maybe it did it looks like
[03:49:24] I don't know I don't know why it doesn't
[03:49:25] crit ratio so low
[03:49:27] Oh wrong weapon that's why
[03:49:32] my vermillion's top one though
[03:49:37] wait number 54 is not bad actually that
[03:49:39] is top one percent
[03:49:43] how do I pull it up one sec chat
[03:50:00] wait what if I do something wait
[03:50:03] what if I do something wait wait there
[03:50:05] has to be a way to do this
[03:50:26] what is that this ratio
[03:50:32] not funny
[03:50:34] all right anyways let's go do something
[03:50:36] um okay I have to [ __ ] uncap this
[03:50:39] we'll go do a Vermillion
[03:50:42] wait that's not Vermillion
[03:50:46] ah [ __ ] it
[03:50:48] [Music]
[03:50:53] on the Vermillion is still going to
[03:50:54] these two bees dude my Vermillion is
[03:50:56] like about as good as my 2v2 piece
[03:50:59] and we've been farming it for like a
[03:51:01] year
[03:51:06] you use gunshot Optimizer dude it
[03:51:08] doesn't tell me [ __ ] because the
[03:51:09] ultimizer literally gives me the same
[03:51:11] it's like it lets me choose five builds
[03:51:13] that are all like the same DPS because
[03:51:15] it's like [ __ ] negligible and then it
[03:51:18] also like
[03:51:19] I feel like Akasha also judges you
[03:51:21] heavily based on the ER bracket you're
[03:51:23] in
[03:51:41] here
[03:51:49] literally I still do more in per million
[03:51:51] right
[03:51:52] yeah I do
[03:52:30] you are not welcome here dare to mess
[03:52:33] with me
[03:52:35] no but okay the thing look like though
[03:52:37] yeah
[03:52:47] worthless
[03:52:59] more
[03:53:03] later
[03:53:20] oh this build is better what the [ __ ]
[03:53:23] wait where what the [ __ ] is this number
[03:53:26] 21 Calamity colors I can't
[03:53:30] Ain't No Way Calamity queller rank 21 on
[03:53:34] two piece two-piece
[03:53:41] oh
[03:53:44] I guess you're going Calamity caller
[03:53:54] I mean to be fair
[03:53:56] doesn't make sense
[03:53:58] but
[03:54:07] [ __ ]
[03:54:14] foreign
[03:54:18] golfing ranking unfortunately
[03:54:36] yeah some of these shot bills are pretty
[03:54:37] cracked
[03:54:56] like they're not unachievable but like
[03:54:59] what the [ __ ] is this goblet
[03:55:17] like what like bro 41 okay Vermillion
[03:55:21] right Vermillion 41 crit damage
[03:55:24] 5.8 ER Oh I thought this was attack okay
[03:55:27] it's HP but still 41 grid damage
[03:55:36] like how
[03:55:38] do you beat that
[03:55:47] that could be you bro I mean it is my
[03:55:50] ayato
[03:55:55] like every time my iPhone is not rank
[03:55:56] one I can usually move artifacts around
[03:55:58] to get it back because there's like a
[03:56:00] bunch of different like leaderboard
[03:56:01] things but like even now he's three
[03:56:04] with 77 crit rates like I could probably
[03:56:06] figure something out but still
[03:56:09] three and then my shot was like six
[03:56:12] million
[03:56:20] Envy is one no Envy is not one
[03:56:26] also the person that is one is glad not
[03:56:28] echoes
[03:56:30] cause I'm dedicated to my craft
[03:56:35] but also I am one
[03:56:45] foreign
[03:56:53] places I mean yeah no [ __ ] because if
[03:56:56] you're if you're like
[03:56:58] when you're in the top percent of
[03:57:00] anything uh small increase is a big
[03:57:02] increase
[03:57:04] because like there's only so much crit
[03:57:06] value you can get right
[03:57:23] yeah I'm a little dead because I barely
[03:57:25] thought about that and I flew in but
[03:57:27] like I just I literally landed off the
[03:57:29] plane today
[03:57:32] and I couldn't sleep on the plane
[03:57:33] because it was like Rocky and they
[03:57:35] wouldn't let people get up so it's kind
[03:57:36] of monkey because it was like a small
[03:57:37] plane and they were like
[03:57:40] I don't know the weather was us
[03:57:51] well we got four what the [ __ ]
[03:57:54] okay surely in four pieces one is good
[03:57:57] this could be fine
[03:58:00] I mean this could be good
[03:58:05] Mikey
[03:58:08] keep in mind that we had enough resin to
[03:58:10] get us a guaranteed 6.1 million tomorrow
[03:58:12] just keep that in mind I could be six
[03:58:14] million more richer
[03:58:19] just get out of mind
[03:58:28] disappear
[03:58:31] worthless
[03:58:37] what have we
[03:58:38] plunge Castle it's a claim maybe that's
[03:58:41] how you gotta enema goblet
[03:58:46] oh well we did get a [ __ ] animal
[03:58:47] goblet
[03:58:49] let's just stop okay maybe we'll try it
[03:58:50] again then
[03:59:02] plunge harder yeah we did a low punch
[03:59:04] maybe maybe High punch okay let's try
[03:59:06] that
[03:59:17] go die
[03:59:19] okay we'll try it
[03:59:21] plunge cancel
[03:59:23] okay that was actually perfect that was
[03:59:25] literally frame perfect and we got the
[03:59:26] eye punch
[03:59:27] boom okay nevermind
[03:59:31] well I'm lucky
[03:59:48] pretty much always a Nemo cup
[03:59:51] attack cup is like pretty close outside
[03:59:53] of Vermilion
[03:59:54] if you have better subsides but then
[03:59:55] with Vermilion it becomes quite a bit
[03:59:57] worse because the Vermillion gives you a
[03:59:59] [ __ ] on attack right so
[04:00:00] anyway God was better
[04:00:04] are you doing quests like High skin I
[04:00:06] was gonna do that today but maybe we do
[04:00:07] artifact today and then tomorrow we do
[04:00:09] Kaya skin and Abyss then I have extra
[04:00:11] content and then that's two streams of
[04:00:13] content and then we explore and then
[04:00:23] tomorrow copium what do you mean copium
[04:00:25] why isn't copium I don't cope
[04:00:30] I need a bit of Crystal flies though
[04:00:32] um some here
[04:01:03] useless
[04:01:05] oh my God we got all three what the [ __ ]
[04:01:08] I never get all three what the [ __ ]
[04:01:10] that's like the first time all right
[04:01:12] cool
[04:01:14] um
[04:01:15] we gotta send yeah yeah if we do one
[04:01:17] more dendro cubes we're gonna go do a
[04:01:18] dendro Cube
[04:01:20] did I actually gaming today yo
[04:01:27] [ __ ]
[04:01:45] okay I'm gonna plunge exactly on the
[04:01:46] cube watch
[04:01:53] okay I mean wow
[04:01:56] wait I can't do it with this team [ __ ]
[04:02:01] okay close enough though
[04:02:10] wait do they make my dad burn herself if
[04:02:12] I oh we're not done anymore okay never
[04:02:14] mind
[04:02:39] [ __ ] that was a bit too early
[04:02:48] no we almost got it I bursted like a
[04:02:52] split second later
[04:02:54] thank you
[04:03:03] minus one of course
[04:03:06] of course
[04:03:17] what I did that
[04:03:23] it's kind of good
[04:03:25] yeah I'll hide them without the item
[04:03:27] he's like ow
[04:03:28] hey look what the [ __ ] is this
[04:03:31] sure I mean attack on instructor sucks
[04:03:33] or whatever whoa
[04:03:38] why I mean
[04:03:40] I'm
[04:03:43] it's like such a waste of luck
[04:03:47] what's your waste of RNG
[04:03:53] I'm not rolling it
[04:04:05] wait because
[04:04:10] foreign
[04:04:17] [Music]
[04:04:45] yeah I agree actually we'll do go then
[04:04:49] good ending for once
[04:04:52] actually wait a second
[04:04:54] what if we do like

[04:08:32] what are you farming for I don't know
[04:08:34] anymore I actually don't know why I even
[04:08:36] do artifact domains I don't even know
[04:08:38] why like I don't know I don't I just
[04:08:40] don't know
[04:08:47] also I kind of want to keep
[04:08:49] um

[04:08:53] resin so that I'm incentivized to stream
[04:08:55] again tomorrow
[04:08:57] although I do have to upload but
[04:09:00] that's so much to do
[04:09:03] so I'll incentivize myself to stream
[04:09:05] again
[04:09:12] remember health comes first you don't
[04:09:15] have to yeah but I want to I miss a
[04:09:16] bunch of Screams that I'm supposed to do

[04:09:22] energy levels are just like depleted but
[04:09:23] I still enjoy it

[04:09:29] end stream oh wait wait
[04:09:33] Eureka I found it okay listen assistant
[04:09:36] new stream and video idea
[04:09:40] this video ends when I get a good
[04:09:42] Vermillion piece
[04:09:44] and then it's like it's either two
[04:09:47] seconds long or like six hours no more
[04:09:49] like five days
[04:09:56] wait that could have been the dude that
[04:09:58] could have been this video
[04:10:00] we just spent 2 000 resin
[04:10:05] this video ends when I get a good
[04:10:07] premillion piece hey guys
[04:10:09] and then we just hit the subathon
[04:10:16] one sub equal one Vermillion
[04:10:43] so this first time chatter first time
[04:10:46] chatter mods here are dog [ __ ] what the
[04:10:48] [ __ ] did they do
[04:10:50] no what did they do it's [ __ ] up
[04:11:03] how much money for you to stop the storm
[04:11:06] and eat a Zuma
[04:11:07] I don't know man
[04:11:09] that's like iconic
[04:11:13] that's like at least that's like at
[04:11:15] least 100 gifted
[04:11:17] and that's a scam like I don't want
[04:11:19] anyone to do that
[04:11:22] huh
[04:11:25] what
[04:11:27] we'll use my level 40 R4 Jade Wing spear
[04:11:32] okay why if you have an R4 Jade spear
[04:11:34] why the [ __ ] is a level 40 first of all
[04:11:36] second of all Jason is good on like
[04:11:38] basically any pole arm that can use
[04:11:41] attack
[04:11:44] I mean even just in general this is good
[04:11:58] oh
[04:12:00] it's that stick
[04:12:15] is Jade to be the best standard five
[04:12:17] star uh Skyward Harps really good
[04:12:20] and um
[04:12:23] this is another really good one that I
[04:12:24] forget
[04:12:28] probably the bat harp and Jade are like
[04:12:30] the two best thoughts gravestone is good
[04:12:32] but play more characters are kind of
[04:12:34] cool but we'll get something's really
[04:12:35] good champ
[04:12:39] well it can be it kind of depends on the
[04:12:41] content you're doing
[04:12:44] avos isn't even best sort of gone you
[04:12:46] Amos is kind of like it was fine but
[04:12:47] it's not that good the catalysts are
[04:12:50] both pretty good like lost crib but
[04:12:51] Atlas is a statistic too like countless
[04:12:54] are good welcome back swords are kind of
[04:12:55] whatever
[04:12:57] Jade Spears
[04:12:59] and Harper like the best
[04:13:02] Skyward weapons are kind of whatever
[04:13:03] because fav except hard yeah
[04:13:13] good we'll meet again
[04:13:22] I don't know what else that is
[04:13:31] two months Cocker
[04:13:39] yeah callous they're just good though
[04:13:41] like [ __ ] every catalyst is well okay
[04:13:43] there's like eye of perception and [ __ ]
[04:13:44] but I swear like every other than like
[04:13:47] the donut or like by juice weapon like
[04:13:48] other than the weird Niche ones like
[04:13:50] there's so many [ __ ] good catalysts
[04:13:51] there's like Winston the solar Pearl
[04:13:54] this [ __ ] Fab there's thrilling Tails
[04:13:57] there's like Amber for characters like
[04:13:59] by Drew there's [ __ ] all of the five
[04:14:02] stars other than the HP ones
[04:14:05] Adorn my Knights oh they're all so good
[04:14:10] yeah
[04:14:12] suggest that there are no good catalysts
[04:14:13] no you did not say that there's no way
[04:14:16] you would say that
[04:14:20] Throne tails is sick and then woodsith
[04:14:23] is like I [ __ ] love what's this and
[04:14:25] what's this gives you like front loaded
[04:14:28] that he did okay well he was wrong and
[04:14:30] then he's gonna explain why his
[04:14:32] statement was right in a context no it's
[04:14:34] wrong with it is broken
[04:14:37] dude what's it is so good
[04:14:41] I don't know how to use it [ __ ] reset
[04:14:42] if you get the one of three blessings
[04:14:44] that are isn't good who the [ __ ] cares
[04:14:46] it's not about five stars oh fair enough
[04:14:50] just R5 your Winston forehead I know
[04:14:52] that's like a whale tank but like if
[04:14:54] you're going for five star weapons
[04:14:57] foreign
[04:15:05] options are fine
[04:15:17] I'm not sure it's not that bad the five
[04:15:18] stars are fine it's just the four stars
[04:15:20] are like you so the thing with callus is
[04:15:22] like usually all the options are like
[04:15:23] about as good
[04:15:25] like in every weapon ranking ever with
[04:15:27] the exceptions of like certain specific
[04:15:29] like
[04:15:30] like you know yeah I liking her
[04:15:32] signature or like the heat on fields
[04:15:34] liking that or the teapot weapon like uh
[04:15:36] other than like the
[04:15:38] other than that a lot of them are like
[04:15:39] about as good
[04:15:41] and like R5 witsith or like solar Pearl
[04:15:43] are usually about as good as the five
[04:15:44] star weapons
[04:15:46] so that's why they're all kind of
[04:15:47] interchangeable but I don't really think
[04:15:49] that's like a bad thing
[04:15:50] like Alice is just a good stat stick on
[04:15:52] everyone
[04:15:54] but then kokomi's weapon and baija's
[04:15:56] weapon are kind of yeah unfortunate
[04:15:59] haha
[04:16:10] huh
[04:16:21] um I want to stream longer but I'm
[04:16:23] [ __ ] tired I have to think about you
