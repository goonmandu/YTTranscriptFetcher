[00:12:41] star floor four who cares you can send
[00:12:44] me a clips of your Abyss maybe for

[00:12:49] don't know what I that would be it would
[00:12:50] have to be like either Ed cursed or like
[00:12:53] like cool so we'll figure it out I'll

[00:13:10] that applied but we're going to reopen
[00:13:12] it so it it's just cuz we had no one to

[00:14:16] I'll be home on my normal setup when I'm
[00:14:19] not sick anymore so soon although I have
[00:14:20] to go to New York for the genin concert
[00:14:22] apparently which is cool I'm not going
[00:14:23] to be there for long but everyone's
[00:14:26] going so I figure I might as well go I
[00:14:27] didn't book anything yet so I could just
[00:14:29] not go but I think I will um
[00:14:33] anyways so yeah um a lot of stuff to do
[00:14:36] today we're going to play our
[00:14:36] free-to-play account we're going to talk
[00:14:38] about some stuff we're going to farm
[00:14:40] resin we're going to do the new event or
[00:14:41] the not even new anymore but the one
[00:14:45] with the one with Chevy um also a few
[00:14:49] things chat one I recorded a banner
[00:14:51] review it's being edited it should be
[00:14:53] out literally tonight on the main
[00:14:55] Channel which I usually don't do but for
[00:14:56] this one uh there's a reason why I want
[00:14:58] to do it that's one two Jean guide is
[00:15:00] done but I'm going to wait because uh I
[00:15:02] recorded it literally as finina came out
[00:15:04] but it got delayed so long cuz I'm
[00:15:06] [ __ ] stupid that now I need footage
[00:15:08] from the new Abyss so we're going to
[00:15:09] have to do a Sunfire clear and then I'll
[00:15:11] just change that and then we'll upload
[00:15:12] it new Ryden guide will come out
[00:15:14] probably and uh Chev guide is also
[00:15:16] coming out I'm going to record the Chev
[00:15:18] guide to tomorrow you might be like how
[00:15:20] do you know Suk well there's a trial of
[00:15:23] her so we know what she does um the only
[00:15:25] thing I don't know about her is the ER
[00:15:27] amounts everything else I can record
[00:15:29] right now but I don't know if she even
[00:15:30] wants ER like I feel like you want to
[00:15:32] use her burst cuz it's damage and Pyro
[00:15:34] app but it doesn't actually do anything
[00:15:37] no it's not sus like there's a trial you
[00:15:38] can literally see
[00:15:40] everything she's basically Neu but for
[00:15:42] overload I'm pretty sure like I I got
[00:15:45] this in game I'm not capping look I'll
[00:15:47] pull it up um whoa whoa whoa whoa I'll
[00:15:50] put on my other monitor [ __ ]
[00:15:53] it [ __ ] the burst and build her DPS E I
[00:15:57] mean maybe dude
[00:16:00] um leaked there's literally nothing
[00:16:04] leaked yeah
[00:16:08] look uh um yeah this is in game right
[00:16:12] now like this is my account this is not
[00:16:14] no like this is like in game so you can
[00:16:15] literally see what she does I didn't
[00:16:16] know this I didn't know I wish someone
[00:16:18] told me
[00:16:21] um yeah so you can literally see what
[00:16:23] she does which is cool
[00:16:26] um so she's basically the Neo of
[00:16:29] overload now overload is kind of a dog
[00:16:31] shed reaction but what's cool is that a
[00:16:34] lot of Electro and Pyro characters are
[00:16:35] pretty good so like Ryden Bennett
[00:16:37] changling that's already overloading by
[00:16:39] accident uh yoia
[00:16:42] fishell B Shang Ling Hut no not Hut you
[00:16:46] want to Vape on her but anyways um so
[00:16:50] basically she gives you 40% uh she
[00:16:53] reduces the re Electro and Pyro res of
[00:16:55] enemies by 40% once you overload she
[00:16:57] also gives you up to four uh how much
[00:17:00] attack 40% or is it yeah up to 40%
[00:17:03] attack and her C6 is
[00:17:05] [ __ ] way better than uh c0 it looks
[00:17:08] like it gives you up to 20 * 3 that's
[00:17:11] 60% power damage and Electro damage
[00:17:13] bonus which is a lot uh and she heals
[00:17:15] you now this is all I haven't tested her
[00:17:20] at all like this is just from reading
[00:17:22] the talents for my understanding this is
[00:17:24] all from your skill so I don't know what
[00:17:26] the point of her burst is that's what
[00:17:29] the point of the Mask is I literally
[00:17:31] don't know like why do you even press Q
[00:17:33] on her I I don't know I have to play her
[00:17:35] a bit to see but like literally why
[00:17:37] where the [ __ ] is it where's her
[00:17:40] burst
[00:17:44] hello the damage who wow I can't wait to
[00:17:48] deal damage on my Neu sorry it's
[00:17:51] actually a decent scaling um it's not
[00:17:53] like bad yeah it's not bad so like you
[00:17:56] know but you're probably stack in HP um
[00:18:01] wait a second does that wait never
[00:18:04] mind are you
[00:18:07] wait wait it is bad wait am I wait am I
[00:18:11] missing
[00:18:13] something you buff based on your HP but
[00:18:16] your burst skills on
[00:18:19] attack wait your damage skills on attack
[00:18:21] but your healing and your buff is HP
[00:18:23] okay yeah why would you even wait why
[00:18:25] would you even go for damage or I mean
[00:18:33] it's not a de moment cuz she's like Neu
[00:18:34] like she'll just buff your damage
[00:18:36] regardless so who cares about her
[00:18:38] damage I mean you could stack her damage
[00:18:41] if the dam okay if the damage she deals
[00:18:44] is better than the attack you would gain
[00:18:47] to your party so let's say you're 20K HP
[00:18:49] without trying you give everyone 20%
[00:18:51] attack would ch's damage be better than
[00:18:54] 20% attack to your Ryden
[00:18:56] maybe I mean probably cuz you're already
[00:18:59] running Bennett and stuff I don't know
[00:19:02] maybe I'll have to figure it out bur is
[00:19:05] good for eye frames yeah of course but
[00:19:07] I'm saying is it worth going crit or do
[00:19:08] you just go [ __ ] HP but yeah I assume
[00:19:11] you already get enough attack so you
[00:19:13] might not need to actually stack
[00:19:14] HP
[00:19:17] um huh maybe you don't need to stack HP
[00:19:20] on her oh if you're C6 you heal though a
[00:19:22] lot maybe at C6 you want
[00:19:26] HP I don't know okay figure it out I'll
[00:19:29] figure it
[00:19:30] out anyways um she seems cool for
[00:19:33] overload teams notably even like R in
[00:19:35] hyper car um not like better than like
[00:19:38] Shang Ling and stuff like for that team
[00:19:40] like you'd rather go like rational but
[00:19:42] at
[00:19:44] C6 uh she could be the last slot in a
[00:19:47] Ryden Sarah Bennett team so that's not a
[00:19:49] bad
[00:19:50] thing um C6 seems really POG outside of
[00:19:54] that it's just a a flat 40% res decrease
[00:19:56] which is huge and some attack per and
[00:19:58] some healing so overall just nice I I I
[00:20:02] already like her uh I don't think she's
[00:20:03] be like broken but I like her for like a
[00:20:05] more teams um the only thing that's
[00:20:07] weird
[00:20:09] is the only thing that's weird is I
[00:20:12] still have no clue if you want to go
[00:20:14] attack or healing um I don't know yet
[00:20:17] I'm going to have to play her and find
[00:20:18] out like in theory if you don't care
[00:20:21] about 20% more attack which is not that
[00:20:23] big of a deal cuz you're running Bennett
[00:20:24] py resonance no bless you probably go
[00:20:26] attack and crit but if you're like you
[00:20:29] need to heal and you're not running
[00:20:31] Bennett like you have no bet let's say
[00:20:32] you're playing overload if you're
[00:20:33] playing overload without Bennett you're
[00:20:34] probably stupid but let's say you are
[00:20:36] let's say it's like yoia no you can't
[00:20:38] cuz Yia you'd run
[00:20:39] Bennett Ryden you'd run Bennett let's
[00:20:42] say you're playing like Sino overload
[00:20:44] let's say you're playing let's say
[00:20:46] you're playing
[00:20:46] Soo
[00:20:49] Chev Shang Ling no you'd run bit there
[00:20:54] offishal and bet three Electro only pyro
[00:20:59] is okay you're not playing that Team
[00:21:04] bro kie can heal two on the Electra
[00:21:07] slot are you telling me you want to play
[00:21:10] overload
[00:21:12] cookie is that what you're getting
[00:21:17] at hell yeah I mean sure uh sure
[00:21:22] but instru yeah you can go instructor on
[00:21:25] her so I don't know I assume meta will
[00:21:28] be fav no bless sub stats don't matter
[00:21:32] and then you just buff your team but I'm
[00:21:33] trying to figure out if it's worth going
[00:21:35] for more healing and some attack percent
[00:21:36] or go for her personal damage probably
[00:21:39] if you're like fully optimized her
[00:21:41] personal damage but is it really worth
[00:21:45] optimizing like your Neu maybe not so
[00:21:48] I'm not sure that's the only thing I
[00:21:49] need to look into but other than that
[00:21:50] she seems pretty straightforward uh
[00:21:52] which is cool so I'll figure that
[00:21:56] out um
[00:21:59] let me write something down in my
[00:22:02] notepad but my notepad is Discord
[00:22:26] DMs
[00:22:30] okay
[00:22:32] sorry all right anyways welcome to the
[00:22:34] stream I wasn't planning on talking
[00:22:35] about her today but uh I just remembered
[00:22:37] that her Kit's in game so I figured
[00:22:39] might as well uh we're going to get
[00:22:40] ready for
[00:22:41] her again we'll be back to normal setup
[00:22:45] soon but I might have to record the
[00:22:46] guide here

[00:32:13] Banner rev wait first of all if you
[00:32:14] didn't see Yes again I am sick that's
[00:32:17] why I'm still here uh we are prant I
[00:32:19] don't know why this tweet popped off but
[00:32:20] it is what it is uh also uh it was
[00:32:23] scara's
[00:32:24] birthday uh so happy birthday Scara
[00:32:28] and there's new banners wow banners
[00:32:31] wow now I made a full uh I think 50
[00:32:35] minute video banner review the reason
[00:32:36] why I wanted to make a banner review
[00:32:38] video and I normally don't is because
[00:32:39] one I haven't uploaded in 15 days but
[00:32:42] jean guys's ready so I could upload that
[00:32:44] but more importantly these Banners are
[00:32:45] special why are they special because you
[00:32:47] get a full [ __ ] team by pulling what
[00:32:49] yes so apparently for some listen you
[00:32:52] can
[00:32:53] skip the banner if you want you can you
[00:32:57] can skip the banner if you want and
[00:32:59] honestly a lot of people will cuz
[00:33:00] there's no new characters other than a
[00:33:02] fourstar
[00:33:05] but
[00:33:07] but if you want Ryden or yoia especially
[00:33:10] if you want Ryden these four stars are
[00:33:12] really good it's a bait Banner no well
[00:33:15] no if you want Ryden it's not bait if
[00:33:17] you're like if you don't want Ryden if
[00:33:18] you want a future character if you are
[00:33:20] [ __ ] have your [ __ ] in your hand and
[00:33:22] you're like oh I just want chlorin or
[00:33:24] you don't care about Ryden or maybe you
[00:33:26] just care about meta writing can be good
[00:33:27] for your account but isn't like needed
[00:33:29] right then yeah you might be like oh
[00:33:31] bait sure don't pull for it but if you
[00:33:33] want wri it the four stars are really
[00:33:34] good because what okay here's you might
[00:33:37] ask okay zck zck zck zck I want to be
[00:33:40] knowledgeable like you what makes
[00:33:42] fourstar characters on a banner good oh
[00:33:45] my dear child let me answer so you might
[00:33:47] think oh the four stars have to be good
[00:33:49] yes but that's not it you they also need
[00:33:52] to have constellations that are good
[00:33:54] because you're going to get a there's a
[00:33:56] good chance you get get a lot of them by
[00:33:58] pulling for the five star so you might
[00:33:59] get none like hazo but you want their
[00:34:03] constellations to be good if you want to
[00:34:04] pull on that Banner Bennett good example
[00:34:06] of this yeah he's been out for like 500
[00:34:08] banners but he's good his C1 is really
[00:34:11] really good his C5 is great C6 is okay
[00:34:14] if you want to activate it Sara also
[00:34:16] gets way better with constellations like
[00:34:18] C2 especially C6 and same with Chev she
[00:34:21] really wants her
[00:34:23] C6 so if you want ryen not only are the
[00:34:26] four star is good but you basically get
[00:34:29] a full team here Bennett is needed in a
[00:34:31] lot of her teams Sara is really good in
[00:34:34] Ryden hyper carry not I don't like Sara
[00:34:36] in any other team that's okay that's SAR
[00:34:39] Ms are going to kill me but for the most
[00:34:41] part but with Ryden pretty decent and
[00:34:43] then Chev also can fit in this team and
[00:34:45] this is literally a team now you can
[00:34:47] replace Chev with kazwa um but I'm
[00:34:49] pretty sure C6 CH performs almost
[00:34:51] similarly now I saw like some like I saw
[00:34:55] some like scuffed math where it's like
[00:34:56] the D damage is the same but like you
[00:34:58] not factoring in the Kazo grouping or
[00:35:00] the like other [ __ ] that he does but
[00:35:01] like for the most part sh actually
[00:35:04] pretty good in this team um do I
[00:35:05] recommend this team over like Ryden
[00:35:07] Shang Ling Singo no but pretty good and
[00:35:11] you can get a full team like for free
[00:35:13] basic well not for free but by pulling
[00:35:14] free rid it y Mia similar concept but
[00:35:18] not really like Bennett works with her
[00:35:20] sh works with her Sara doesn't but
[00:35:22] that's already two characters that like
[00:35:24] sh we don't know yet but there's a good
[00:35:26] chance that she does synergize with her
[00:35:28] although I doubt you're going to want to
[00:35:30] bench her like Vape team for that but if
[00:35:32] you want to play overload you can um so
[00:35:34] that's cool for stars that synergize
[00:35:35] with the banner character is very cool
[00:35:37] especially for
[00:35:38] Ryden
[00:35:42] um wouldn't she be better with Y well
[00:35:45] the thing is she's good in overload
[00:35:46] teams it's where do you want to play
[00:35:47] your overload the thing with Ryden isn't
[00:35:50] that you need overload for Ryden is that
[00:35:52] you're playing like if you're playing
[00:35:54] Ryden hyper carry you're already running
[00:35:55] benit Sara so sh actually does pretty
[00:35:58] well there that's the thing um yoia I
[00:36:02] think I'm a bit harsh on her like she's
[00:36:05] fine I I genuinely think like if you
[00:36:06] want her she's decent she's not like
[00:36:09] amazing like for single the problem is
[00:36:11] it's like single Target and it's like
[00:36:13] you'd rather have like for single Target
[00:36:15] you have hyper Bloom and you have you
[00:36:17] might have Hut or you can get Hut or
[00:36:20] there's like a bunch of other options
[00:36:21] but like she's decent and there's bosses
[00:36:23] where she's good and a lot of abysses
[00:36:25] have single Target one boss so
[00:36:28] like as much as I'm like you don't need
[00:36:30] her I recognize her potential value so
[00:36:35] there's that if you want her and then
[00:36:36] for Ryden she's very versatile because
[00:36:41] you can play hyper blo you can play
[00:36:43] hyper carry you can play rational uh you
[00:36:45] can kind of play aggravate not really
[00:36:46] but you can
[00:36:49] um and she gets better with like C2 gets
[00:36:51] better with engulfing has a lot of teams
[00:36:53] like and you can literally as I said
[00:36:54] just hyper Bloom her like if you're like
[00:36:56] okay [ __ ] I don't like playing Ryden
[00:36:57] hyper Bloom press e that's it so there's
[00:36:59] a lot of stuff you can do with her I
[00:37:00] actually really like Ryden um and Y is
[00:37:03] fine if you want her so I like I
[00:37:04] actually do like these banners apart
[00:37:06] from the fact that there's like the five
[00:37:08] stars aren't new like they're reruns so
[00:37:10] if you want to wait for a new character
[00:37:11] do that but if you want them pretty
[00:37:14] decent Banner for them um
[00:37:16] although there's no yunen for you Mia
[00:37:18] but you don't I mean this team wouldn't
[00:37:20] run it anyways
[00:37:22] so why is someone spamming worst limited
[00:37:24] five star I can't dude calm
[00:37:28] down calm
[00:37:30] down
[00:37:33] anyways calm
[00:37:43] down most insane
[00:37:45] streamer do yys run I did too it
[00:37:48] honestly was fine Ry isn't that bad no
[00:37:51] Ryden is sick anyways for the weapon man
[00:37:55] um
[00:37:58] I am very mixed
[00:38:00] feelings very mixed feelings so the five
[00:38:03] star weapons are really
[00:38:04] good
[00:38:09] um but okay let's go one by one so
[00:38:12] thundering pulse is basically bow of H
[00:38:15] same exact stats 608 base attack 66
[00:38:17] point something crit damage and for free
[00:38:19] 20%
[00:38:21] attack yeah you get 20% attack which is
[00:38:23] pretty good you can use on anyone but um
[00:38:27] yeah there's some situations where other
[00:38:28] bows are better but just that makes it a
[00:38:30] good stat stick and for yoia or
[00:38:32] technically child but mostly like bow
[00:38:34] normal attackers which is primarily yoia
[00:38:36] you get a bunch of normal attack damage
[00:38:38] which is good engulfing lightning um is
[00:38:43] good for characters that need ER amazing
[00:38:45] for Ryden can be good on high ER
[00:38:48] requirement Shang Ling teams can be good
[00:38:49] with Shang uh
[00:38:51] Shena and in general just a decent
[00:38:54] statistic like would I rather have that
[00:38:55] or like h on my account probably H but
[00:38:57] it's a pretty good statti if you want it
[00:38:59] for Ryden or someone like
[00:39:01] that uh and th pulse is really good for
[00:39:04] the four
[00:39:06] stars but but also I wanted to say I
[00:39:08] mean I say this in my video like I I go
[00:39:09] into more details so watch that but I
[00:39:11] don't think engulfing is needed as much
[00:39:13] as people used to think because there's
[00:39:16] the catch and there's like even
[00:39:18] wavebreaker fin here with the
[00:39:19] refinements there's uh basically any
[00:39:22] five star like Skyward spine is similar
[00:39:24] to catch H Jade spear stuff like that is
[00:39:27] are pretty good on Ryden and you might
[00:39:28] already have them and if you're giving
[00:39:30] one to Shang Ling you can give like the
[00:39:31] catch to the other or you could give
[00:39:33] Kain cross spear to Shang Ling or like
[00:39:34] there's a lot of good pole arms but
[00:39:36] engulfing is good for the four stars
[00:39:38] rust is good for Yia outside of that go
[00:39:40] [ __ ] yourself fav sword is broken it's
[00:39:43] amazing it's good on literally any sword
[00:39:45] well any support sword character it's so
[00:39:48] [ __ ] good it's so good that it's it
[00:39:50] it can sometimes be good on Bennett even
[00:39:51] though the base stack is [ __ ] garbage
[00:39:53] um you use it on like literally everyone
[00:39:56] very good wavebreaker fin is great with
[00:39:59] refinements without refinements it's
[00:40:00] kind of poo poo but with refinements it
[00:40:01] could be better than the catch or
[00:40:03] similar um depending on your team and
[00:40:05] burst stuff pretty good not for every
[00:40:08] character though it's mostly for I was
[00:40:09] looking through the pole arms I was
[00:40:11] thinking of Ryden shengling and um
[00:40:14] Rosaria who could use it maybe Shena but
[00:40:17] you don't really want that on Shena and
[00:40:19] I can't really think of anyone
[00:40:20] else Jong Lee yeah but no like you're
[00:40:24] not really playing burst J Le if you are
[00:40:26] sure but you'd rather go fav so yeah
[00:40:29] that's like basically it but since those
[00:40:31] are the characters you're pulling for if
[00:40:32] you're going for like Ryden then it
[00:40:33] could be five like let's say you lose
[00:40:35] the 50-50 and you have like a bunch of
[00:40:36] wave breaker fins you could just use
[00:40:38] that uh rain slasher sucks but it's well
[00:40:41] okay it doesn't suck it's okay and vape
[00:40:43] the Luke gives you em and uh damage
[00:40:46] against pyro sorry Hydro affected
[00:40:48] opponents so good for Vape outside of
[00:40:50] that it's like Niche hyper Bloom stuff
[00:40:52] for like Dory or cave but it's not great
[00:40:54] it's just good for like duuke um um
[00:40:57] maybe
[00:41:01] DEA and then I have perception
[00:41:05] sucks so yeah I actually do like these
[00:41:07] banners uh if you care about like these
[00:41:09] these characters like if you're waiting
[00:41:11] for someone skip but if you care about
[00:41:12] the like Ryden or Gia they're pretty
[00:41:16] good oh yeah it's okay for bet aggravate
[00:41:18] I forgot about that that's uh not a bad
[00:41:22] point uh let me write that down it is
[00:41:25] okay
[00:41:37] I did forget about
[00:41:38] that but yeah that's it um balls so the
[00:41:42] video on this will be out later and then
[00:41:44] uh I have to record a sh's guide so stay
[00:41:46] tuned for that
[00:41:47] also chat if you didn't watch the second
[00:41:50] Channel video go watch it it's a banger
[00:41:52] uh goated video by Mariah as always I
[00:41:55] think I might upload some videos like
[00:41:57] these to the main Channel because I feel
[00:41:59] like mari's editing is too good for the
[00:42:00] second Channel but the problem is the
[00:42:02] second channel has such high quality I
[00:42:03] kind of want to keep it like this so
[00:42:05] we'll see but I might cuz my my main
[00:42:07] channel is kind of a desert like I don't
[00:42:08] upload enough so whenever I feel like I
[00:42:09] need a video I might upload one of these
[00:42:11] with like a different thumbnail maybe to
[00:42:13] the main channel so we'll see
[00:42:17] um so yeah we'll see maybe um what I did
[00:42:21] decided to do I told you guys last
[00:42:22] stream I gave him the 10 account review
[00:42:23] so that'll be out soon um but uh it it
[00:42:27] is a banger so stay tuned for
[00:42:32] that but I do want to keep the main
[00:42:34] Channel more like guide Focus well not
[00:42:36] entirely but more like primarily guide
[00:42:39] focused so yeah anyways thanks for
[00:42:42] watching the intro to the stream that
[00:42:43] was uh 42 minutes time to launch gion
[00:42:46] impact is there anything else you want
[00:42:48] to talk
[00:42:50] about I don't think
[00:42:55] so
[00:42:57] fridge
[00:43:01] stream sorry I don't know why I just hit
[00:43:03] my
[00:43:05] mic I have to dude I can't keep genin
[00:43:08] open in the background cuz I'm on a
[00:43:10] laptop so
[00:43:12] yeah are you doing viewer
[00:43:15] plls no okay if if if I told you this so
[00:43:21] if we ever get a scyon I'm probably
[00:43:23] going to do viewer plls for like
[00:43:25] significant characters Maybe archons
[00:43:26] maybe fouille characters maybe whatever
[00:43:28] right like or if I'm doing a challenge
[00:43:30] against someone like I did one against
[00:43:31] Jake we did neved fuls but if they ever
[00:43:34] release a scythe I will do viewer plls
[00:43:36] and I will give away multiple sides and
[00:43:39] I don't I usually hate giveaways because
[00:43:41] I don't like people that are like oh
[00:43:43] follow me G follow me for giveaways but
[00:43:46] if there's a scythe we'll do
[00:43:55] some
[00:44:00] Suk he knows dude how would I literally

[00:49:58] run Abyss with Ryden I did off stream I
[00:50:00] could do it again on stream today okay
[00:50:02] before we spend our resin oh my leg
[00:50:05] we're going to spend our resin but we
[00:50:07] have some other stuff to do first okay
[00:50:09] first of
[00:50:10] all we have to get our daily watatsumi
[00:50:12] Island
[00:50:14] chest and we have to do an abyss run and
[00:50:17] we have to do commissions and or
[00:50:21] Navia uh Navia
[00:50:24] and
[00:50:27] we're going to play our free to playay
[00:50:28] count and we have to do the event we
[00:50:30] have a lot to
[00:50:31] do wateri uh when we started this was at
[00:50:35] 30% we are now at 79 if we can get maybe
[00:50:38] like 80 81
[00:50:42] hey so we're going to speed onun a chest
[00:50:45] the event takes 3 hours oh okay maybe
[00:50:48] we'll just do like half today I don't
[00:50:49] don't
[00:50:50] know wait I did some of the quest though
[00:50:52] I was doing the quest I did the quest
[00:50:53] off stream I don't cuz I don't give a
[00:50:55] [ __ ] about the quest but I wanted to do
[00:50:56] like the fun stuff
[00:50:59] dude EES dropper dude I literally have
[00:51:03] done like half of fina's quest by
[00:51:05] getting forced into cut scenes I
[00:51:07] couldn't continue the event because I
[00:51:08] had to do fina's Quest like I had to
[00:51:10] like character involved in another
[00:51:16] Quest I didn't skip it though I was like
[00:51:18] listening to finina she was like fine
[00:51:20] I'll join you but yeah so I did like
[00:51:23] literally half of it
[00:51:28] oh where is it
[00:51:30] down I do love
[00:51:33] finina is Maiden Bennett still meta okay
[00:51:36] I was actually looking into to Bennett
[00:51:38] right nobless is obviously still the
[00:51:40] best well unless you need instructor but
[00:51:43] if you play him with finina his best in
[00:51:44] slot set is
[00:51:47] actually um the song of days past
[00:51:51] potentially not always but if you're
[00:51:53] running finina you know how I was like
[00:51:54] running him on maidens you can go song
[00:51:56] aay past cuz it gives you healing bonus
[00:51:58] and it gives you some damage so
[00:52:00] especially with like Ryden uh not Ryden
[00:52:01] sorry uh finina sha which I play I'm
[00:52:06] going to want this set so I've been
[00:52:08] farming it off
[00:52:09] stream um it's actually good for Bennett
[00:52:11] with finina I don't know on who else
[00:52:13] it's good I know you guys are typing sus
[00:52:15] cuz yeah probably a future character but
[00:52:17] for now it's mostly Bennett maybe chi6
[00:52:19] but I don't know if her healing is good
[00:52:20] enough probably not um
[00:52:24] and yeah it's for characters that heal
[00:52:26] Charlotte sure it's for characters that
[00:52:28] heal a lot at a fast interval um but you
[00:52:31] also need to wait six seconds before it
[00:52:32] starts which is annoying like from the
[00:52:35] moment you heal but it is good for
[00:52:37] Bennett again with finina um the procs
[00:52:40] aren't a lot of damage
[00:52:42] it's better than um so the way the
[00:52:46] damage work the way the damage look I
[00:52:47] could be wrong cuz it's a new set and
[00:52:50] it's a long ass effect and I'm a dumbass
[00:52:52] but from my understanding the way it
[00:52:54] works is that it's like Shena quills
[00:52:58] where it's like you're scaling then it's
[00:53:00] added and then it's times crit damage
[00:53:02] and all that stuff I think and so
[00:53:05] because of that it can sometimes be
[00:53:08] better than the little bit of attack
[00:53:09] you're gaining if you can actually make
[00:53:12] uh get it like once or twice per
[00:53:13] rotation now usually it's not the
[00:53:16] biggest damage like I don't recommend
[00:53:18] this for the average benett so for most
[00:53:20] people in chat ignore what I'm saying
[00:53:22] but if you're playing him with finina
[00:53:24] you need the additional healing because
[00:53:26] you're not you want to heal as much as
[00:53:28] you can with Bennett if he's your only
[00:53:29] healer with finina so because of that
[00:53:31] the healing bonus is like almost better
[00:53:34] than no blast on its own so a set like
[00:53:36] this could be better
[00:53:38] um yes so that's why I want it uh I'm
[00:53:43] not sure about so okay also because my
[00:53:45] Gene guy took so long to make now this
[00:53:48] set is out and I have to talk about it I
[00:53:50] don't think you run this on Jean uh I
[00:53:52] like it's okay maybe if you like don't
[00:53:56] need Verdes and vener but like yeah you
[00:53:59] probably just run VV the only thing is
[00:54:01] like what if you're running like shiao
[00:54:02] Jang Le albo I know no one plays that
[00:54:05] team anymore but what if you are then
[00:54:07] you're like okay you could go to bless
[00:54:08] but what if your jang's on well your J
[00:54:10] will be on milth so you probably just go
[00:54:12] to blast
[00:54:13] but yeah you probably just go to
[00:54:17] blast 1.2 team kek W dude shut
[00:54:21] up but I think I'm going to mention it
[00:54:24] cuz technically it's fine um what if the
[00:54:28] damage on Pro on the wrong character
[00:54:30] well it doesn't
[00:54:32] really um matter cuz it's
[00:54:38] well yeah I mean I guess you could [ __ ]
[00:54:40] it up but
[00:54:43] yeah I think it's worth mentioning as an
[00:54:45] alternative to no Bless but it's usually
[00:54:48] not going to be better I don't think and
[00:54:50] outside of that you probably aren't even
[00:54:51] running to bless Jee cuz if you're
[00:54:52] playing Gan you want vescent because if
[00:54:54] you don't want veresen why are you
[00:54:55] running Jean with the only exception
[00:54:56] being a sh team but even then so
[00:54:59] anyways that's all sorry for the
[00:55:03] rant wait where the [ __ ] was the chest

[01:09:00] moment we're going to take this one
[01:09:01] feather Sans goblet ciret nice ratio 74

[01:10:31] like it's like a cut scene bro okay I
[01:10:33] know I know I know we need are I know I
[01:10:35] know I know I know I know I know I know

[01:46:14] the torn to
[01:46:19] Oblivion
[01:46:26] all
[01:46:30] right probably not with your freetop
[01:46:32] play
[01:46:33] artifacts
[01:46:40] okay uh what is
[01:46:44] this
[01:46:46] Crystal it's fine we can play
[01:46:49] navio um
[01:46:52] Navia
[01:46:57] kazua also yeah I did see the light uh
[01:47:00] chat for those of you who have no albo
[01:47:02] or Jeong
[01:47:04] Lee you can use
[01:47:07] JMC I played around with it a little you
[01:47:10] can I
[01:47:11] still probably would just go like Shang
[01:47:14] Ling benett Singo or like fishal and
[01:47:17] then no Geo character but um you can
[01:47:21] it's it's not
[01:47:24] bad uh what do we want to we want to
[01:47:26] crystallize so we probably want uh we'll
[01:47:28] do finina
[01:47:30] Bennett and Jonathan
[01:47:36] maybe crit rate is nice yeah but so the
[01:47:40] reason why I'm not a big fan of it is
[01:47:44] cuz well I mean it's not that I'm not a
[01:47:47] big fan it's it's crit rate energy some
[01:47:50] damage but not a lot and like suppor of
[01:47:52] whatever like fav no blast whatever or
[01:47:54] fav whatever said you want to go it's F
[01:47:56] like it's never going to be like bad
[01:47:58] it's just like would I rather have that
[01:48:00] than like official or a SRO or something
[01:48:02] in my team usually no but if you need
[01:48:04] the Geo battery then it's it's fine it's
[01:48:07] fine I probably should have mentioned it
[01:48:09] a little bit more in hindsight which is
[01:48:10] why I'm talking about it um but I mean
[01:48:14] to be fair I like I like before I
[01:48:16] uploaded the video I pinned a comment
[01:48:18] about it just in case people were like y
[01:48:19] if you don't have albo J Le but I feel
[01:48:21] like if you want to play Navia it's
[01:48:23] worthwhile getting a Geo five star for
[01:48:25] her but if you don't J is fine okay
[01:48:27] we're going to play
[01:48:35] this attack

[02:13:50] could play them together uh this team's
[02:13:52] pretty good like this team's pretty good
[02:13:55] but
[02:14:10] um try not to use Shia why are you
[02:14:13] acting like Shia is like brok in this
[02:14:15] Abyss this isn't really an abyss for
[02:14:17] Shia but he he he's good okay he's good
[02:14:19] second half like a 122 he's good 122
[02:14:23] both sides he's actually really good 122
[02:14:25] second half uh 123 is also really good
[02:14:28] but 121 second half he kind of he's not
[02:14:30] the best against thunder man if that's
[02:14:32] the the worst
[02:14:43] part yo Mia I mean I already played Yia
[02:14:47] second half it was uh it was
[02:14:51] okay we can do it I don't have Bennett
[02:14:54] available though but we could do Yun Jin
[02:15:13] jongi here's a challenge don't play sh
[02:15:15] for one Abyss rotation listen here sh's
[02:15:18] not even the best character on my
[02:15:19] account and I don't use his
[02:15:20] constellations other than C1 so I
[02:15:23] literally just use him to say that I
[02:15:24] clear every Abyss with him just to make
[02:15:26] sure it's possible and just to do it
[02:15:28] it's not like I'm choosing him because
[02:15:30] he's like the most broken character he's
[02:15:31] good in a lot of Abes but he's not the
[02:15:33] best in other abysses it depends what
[02:15:34] we're fighting if I wanted to just play
[02:15:36] [ __ ] cringe ass meta I would just

[02:46:23] please explain M goblet
[02:46:26] lore explain em goblet lore
[02:46:29] no there is no lore
[02:46:33] there
[02:46:37] also I was listening to some
[02:46:40] people talk about some underrated
[02:46:42] artifact
[02:46:43] sets and I heard this isn't stun loock
[02:46:46] this is literally just random like
[02:46:47] random people talking and it wasn't even
[02:46:48] wrong but uh
[02:46:53] about about how people initially were
[02:46:56] saying that City of Gold is not worth
[02:46:58] farming and then magically everyone has
[02:47:00] this on this account on their accounts
[02:47:02] this might be true and honestly it
[02:47:03] probably is but I don't even have this
[02:47:05] set
[02:47:07] yet dude I should get I don't even I
[02:47:09] literally just use gilded for hyper
[02:47:11] Bloom as someone who has basically unlim
[02:47:15] I want to say unlimited resin because of
[02:47:16] how much I play the game like literally
[02:47:18] every single day non-stop for all my
[02:47:19] life but I spend all in Vermillion but
[02:47:23] it's
[02:47:25] like I feel like for the average player
[02:47:27] or if you're just trying to ninar the
[02:47:28] abyss you're not going to farm this
[02:47:30] unless you want like Scara and you're
[02:47:31] doing this then sure but like for most
[02:47:33] like first time Nine Star abysstar
[02:47:36] you're not farming this cuz it's not
[02:47:37] worth it it just isn't but like I'm for
[02:47:40] me I should have it because now to to to
[02:47:44] reverse the stun lock I think it's
[02:47:47] pretty easy to just get four pieces like
[02:47:49] usable pieces compared to like uh a a
[02:47:52] set of an artifact that's uh like
[02:47:55] offensive but I'm pretty sure I spent 5K
[02:47:57] resin and then get an em goblet or
[02:47:58] circlet so unlucky Actually I don't even
[02:48:02] think that's true how much did I spend
[02:48:03] 2K there's no way I spent 5K here I
[02:48:05] would have made a video on
[02:48:09] it but I could have used a fourar I just
[02:48:12] threw them all I think
[02:48:20] no I farmed it for five months it's not
[02:48:23] worth it yeah I mean it
[02:48:25] isn't it isn't I'm not like it like I
[02:48:28] said when it came out it's not if you
[02:48:30] have golden uh golden troop which you
[02:48:33] should and I still agree with that take
[02:48:36] but I'm saying for me who's black Hing
[02:48:39] resin in Vermilion I probably should
[02:48:41] have one set of it just one cuz I
[02:48:44] already have a good feather and flower
[02:48:45] which are the hard Parts usually or
[02:48:48] golden troop whatever the [ __ ] it's
[02:48:49] called Gilden dreams dude what did I say
[02:48:51] a [ __ ] gilded Dreams yeah Guild the
[02:48:54] dreams that's what I
[02:49:02] meant talk to Z Jeff about flop yeah but
[02:49:05] why would he do
[02:49:09] it why would Z Jeff go
[02:49:13] there
[02:49:20] I want to do the new domain though so
[02:49:22] hopefully we go in get
[02:49:30] out what is flop
[02:49:33] de no it's flower of Paradise Lost it's
[02:49:36] an artifact
[02:49:37] set sorry I love D I actually do I
[02:49:40] actually love D I actually love D I
[02:49:41] actually love D I actually do I actually
[02:49:43] do I actually do
[02:49:48] dude I
[02:49:50] saw I saw someone oh dude I saw someone
[02:49:54] uh who the [ __ ] am I playing in this
[02:49:56] team rizy I saw someone on Twitter
[02:49:59] called uh finina mid and then they got
[02:50:01] like 600 quote tweets like dude it's
[02:50:04] like calm like literally like they're
[02:50:07] like die it's like
[02:50:10] chill look don't get me wrong I love
[02:50:12] finina and I think everyone that hates
[02:50:14] on is for the most part well okay
[02:50:16] there's some valid criticisms but like
[02:50:18] usually it's attention seeking so I'm
[02:50:20] not uh I love finina but also
[02:50:31] chill that's weird for me like I think
[02:50:34] people that attention seek by like
[02:50:36] [ __ ] on something that is popular
[02:50:38] because people like it with no valid
[02:50:39] criticism and then they get called out
[02:50:42] and then they cry it's like you kind of
[02:50:43] asked for it but if it's like if people
[02:50:45] are like [ __ ] death threading people
[02:50:47] it's like okay maybe not that far like
[02:50:48] calm down I see that a lot on genin uh
[02:50:51] well I guess it's most it's not just
[02:50:53] genin like I see that a lot where it's
[02:50:54] like someone like is being stupid so
[02:50:57] like they get called out for it which is
[02:50:59] fair but then some people start like
[02:51:01] [ __ ] doxing them or giving death
[02:51:03] threats like bro like [ __ ] yeah the
[02:51:05] other person's stupid but calm
[02:51:11] down at you silver wolf moment
[02:51:21] okay all right first time in this domain
[02:51:23] in like two
[02:51:25] years wow whoa bad chest what a great
[02:51:32] domain it's a shame I need to do this
[02:51:34] domain for hyper Bloom it's a sh calm
[02:51:43] down I'm going in let's light it
[02:51:48] up this one's got your name on it stun
[02:51:52] locked okay Warfare I guess umbrella

[02:51:58] guess Feeling
[02:52:04] Lucky Strike A
[02:52:06] P let's
[02:52:08] begin dude scars get flop but Shia Mains
[02:52:12] we get Echoes and I would rather have a
[02:52:14] set that doesn't work than a set
[02:52:17] that's
[02:52:19] flop no I
[02:52:21] wouldn't I hate
[02:52:35] Echo wow
[02:52:39] this this is such an ugly domain
[02:52:43] dude
[02:52:46] got an em purple sand though I don't
[02:52:49] need I already have a I have a sand I
[02:52:50] need a goblet or a ciret that's all I
[02:52:52] don't know if I'm ever going to use flop
[02:52:54] like I don't really care for it but as I
[02:52:56] said I feel like I might as well have
[02:52:57] one just cuz like if I'm going to play
[02:53:00] this game for like years I might as well
[02:53:02] have like a set right that's just my
[02:53:05] logic it's kind of like why it's kind of
[02:53:07] why I farm like every news had at least
[02:53:08] a bit your name on
[02:53:11] it no one asked

[03:09:20] um yeah what's better for Gene anemo
[03:09:23] damage or attack goblet all questions
[03:09:24] will be answered in my upcoming Gene
[03:09:26] guide however if you're playing without
[03:09:28] finina like a pre 4.2 gamer anemo goet
[03:09:31] would be better for damage however with
[03:09:33] the release of finina falor uh the true
[03:09:35] Hydro archon outside of kookomi who is
[03:09:37] the real one uh Gan would want an attack
[03:09:39] goet to get more healing because the
[03:09:41] damage isn't that big of a difference
[03:09:42] but having some more healing can help
[03:09:44] you stack fina's passive fully or her
[03:09:46] her her her Fan Fair points which can be
[03:09:49] more
[03:09:53] valuable
[03:09:56] okay
[03:10:09] idiots okay never
[03:10:11] mind
[03:10:24] the at win 4.4 next
[03:10:27] patch my gen is not
[03:10:31] responding
[03:10:36] good
[03:10:41] Suk
[03:10:59] we don't have Stellar therap uh I said
[03:11:01] Stellar therapy Stellar Journey because
[03:11:03] I've actually been playing on the
[03:11:04] account a little bit a little bit uh we
[03:11:07] don't so this account actually up to
[03:11:09] date actually up to date actually up to
[03:11:11] date uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[03:11:16] um okay yeah I've actually been playing
[03:11:18] a little playing a
[03:11:20] little so let me show you guys something
[03:11:23] okay let me show you guys something
[03:11:25] hello Fang I'm not playing lethal
[03:11:26] company but hi welcome to the
[03:11:29] stream we're on the free to play account
[03:11:31] right now I can't variety stream on my
[03:11:34] laptop that's the only problem cuz in my
[03:11:36] dude I don't know if this computer can
[03:11:38] can handle anything when I'm home
[03:11:41] maybe
[03:11:43] hello though how are
[03:11:45] you okay let me
[03:11:58] explain okay Fang I'm playing my freeto
[03:12:00] playay account okay this happens once a
[03:12:02] year let me this happens once a
[03:12:09] year we can play it later though if you
[03:12:12] want probably after the
[03:12:17] stream play with Fang loser I mean I
[03:12:20] want to but I'd rather play genin so I
[03:12:22] don't know I don't know I don't know I
[03:12:23] don't know I don't like playing other
[03:12:25] games they
[03:12:32] suck you explained it 10 times okay L
[03:12:40] RZ I don't know dude
[03:12:47] uh okay the problem with the problem
[03:12:49] with this Abyss listen I know I've
[03:12:51] explained what teams I want to run like
[03:12:52] 50 times
[03:12:58] right well I wanted to play hyper
[03:13:01] bloom or an electr based
[03:13:05] team and Sh but the problem is hyper
[03:13:10] bloom or an electro based team doesn't
[03:13:12] really work in the second half and Shia
[03:13:16] would have performed better in the
[03:13:18] first cuz I would play Shia Shang Ling
[03:13:20] and then Shang Ling could Vape the tulpa
[03:13:21] so if I actually want to win this Abyss
[03:13:23] I'd have to play Shang Ling first
[03:13:27] half or I do uh Shia second and then
[03:13:30] hyper Bloom first which is probably what
[03:13:32] I'm going to do the problem is that
[03:13:35] Fishel her A4 passive I'm pretty sure
[03:13:39] still doesn't work against the PMA small
[03:13:43] Indie
[03:13:45] company so uh
[03:13:48] yeah but it should still be fine second
[03:13:51] half is good for iper Blom no but the
[03:13:53] problem
[03:13:54] is okay let me re explain
[03:13:58] actually our team is like
[03:14:01] fishal maybe B I guess we could bench B
[03:14:05] but my point is like we have a lot of
[03:14:06] Electro damage but I guess it's probably
[03:14:09] fine official does nothing second do you
[03:14:10] think we could still three star on our
[03:14:12] free count even if fishal does nothing
[03:14:13] here it's only the hyper Blom damage
[03:14:15] which is probably
[03:14:18] enough yeah it's probably
[03:14:22] fine but like even this is annoying even
[03:14:25] if especially if have no Claymore hello
[03:14:27] what's up why you why did you middle
[03:14:30] finger
[03:14:32] me
[03:14:34] f okay I
[03:14:38] can't but yeah I don't
[03:14:41] know
[03:14:44] cuz the thing is no Nita it's not fine
[03:14:49] yeah our only D is also DMC and thunder
[03:14:52] man if staying in the circle is probably
[03:14:53] not
[03:14:55] happening that's also a
[03:14:59] problem so yeah that's what I was my
[03:15:01] plan was sh second half instead of
[03:15:06] first no ya ya dude dude look at our
[03:15:10] [ __ ] look the we these are the only
[03:15:13] dendro characters we can
[03:15:23] use so it would probably be Shia second
[03:15:27] and then like this on the
[03:15:31] first and then last L is flex okay I
[03:15:35] have to PE chat [ __ ] you let me be B
[03:15:36] I'll be fast and then we'll play this
[03:15:41] account
[03:20:40] for
[03:21:09] sorry CH I was [ __ ] eating I was like
[03:21:12] [ __ ] it I couldn't resist there's a
[03:21:13] slice of pizza on the
[03:21:17] table
[03:21:19] hello wait my [ __ ] thing is
[03:21:23] Tangled
[03:21:31] scatter dude it's so tangled what the
[03:21:33] one
[03:21:40] sec bro
[03:21:45] I okay I actually don't know how to do
[03:21:47] this dude I my [ __ ] headset's
[03:21:50] literally like six wrapped over the
[03:21:59] chair okay I don't know if it's the
[03:22:02] headset's problem or like the chairs
[03:22:04] problem whichever one it is I need to
[03:22:05] throw it and never buy it
[03:22:07] again okay we're
[03:22:10] fine
[03:22:12] what is bro
[03:22:19] doing dude this always happens but it
[03:22:22] usually I don't know it happens more
[03:22:23] here than at
[03:22:24] home give me pizza too
[03:22:28] sure I'll get you food
[03:22:32] chat okay I'm
[03:22:34] back
[03:22:40] hello
[03:22:45] I thought aboba got
[03:22:47] removed
[03:22:48] never oboba shall not
[03:22:51] falter there's a bounty on his
[03:22:58] head there's a bounty on aoba's
[03:23:03] head um okay where the [ __ ] should we
[03:23:10] start
[03:23:14] where should we start
[03:23:21] chat Vermillion no we have to be
[03:23:29] responsible J rhyme uh now than a gifted
[03:23:32] appreciate
[03:23:40] it
[03:23:42] uh
[03:23:48] realistically we probably get a four
[03:23:50] piece
[03:23:52] deepwood uh how many deepwood pieces
[03:23:54] wait I I might have a four piece
[03:23:56] deepwood wait a
[03:23:58] second deepwood
[03:24:04] memories I don't have an ER sand that's
[03:24:08] important we could run an offset Sans
[03:24:22] I dude okay listen I need a Fab sword
[03:24:25] but I don't want to pull but next Banner
[03:24:28] has fav sword so maybe it's worth it I
[03:24:30] don't know but we really need dude dude
[03:24:32] DMC with no fav is so
[03:24:35] bad
[03:24:37] um we could run like sack R1
[03:24:43] or colay with
[03:24:46] fav um but I don't know how I feel about
[03:24:49] that sapwood yes but I would need to
[03:24:52] unlock sapwood and for that I need
[03:24:54] araras and I also need a sapwood for my
[03:25:02] Bennett so I don't know how that's going
[03:25:06] to
[03:25:10] go R2 festering om yeah don't talk to me
[03:25:15] Fontan pipe okay that doesn't even do
[03:25:21] anything um okay I think we should start
[03:25:25] by
[03:25:30] leveling probably there's no way we
[03:25:32] don't play SRO
[03:25:40] right
[03:25:44] I don't know if we do the golden domain
[03:25:46] I actually don't think it's efficient
[03:25:48] right now well it might be it's only
[03:25:50] good
[03:25:51] so Golden's really good for
[03:25:55] fishal but our sha doesn't need M CH cuz
[03:25:58] we already have a good um we're going to
[03:26:01] get so look we have one really good
[03:26:04] vescent and another really good vescent
[03:26:06] so there's no point in upgrading so
[03:26:08] we're probably going to do twopiece
[03:26:09] twopiece we have a really good Vermilion
[03:26:10] too so we literally need a fourth
[03:26:12] Vermilion piece I'm not even joking by
[03:26:14] the way so we literally half the
[03:26:16] Vermilion uh so mag say is like more
[03:26:19] efficient for Shia but I don't know if
[03:26:22] farming a brand new set is
[03:26:24] worth
[03:26:31] um and but I don't have a official
[03:26:34] set it is it's like 10% wow but it's
[03:26:38] also worth cuz official so maybe
[03:26:42] um maybe it's just that then this piece
[03:26:45] becomes wasted and so does this piece
[03:26:48] but it's
[03:26:57] fine Shia has a lot of crit rate and
[03:27:00] doesn't increase his plunge damage I
[03:27:01] mean I'm pretty sure it does I'm pretty
[03:27:04] sure crit
[03:27:06] rate means you can build crit damage
[03:27:09] which increases your plunge damage
[03:27:12] so it
[03:27:18] does that stamina bar shut the [ __ ]
[03:27:25] up I actually might die here there's a
[03:27:27] good chance I die my sucros has 7,000 HP
[03:27:30] for the record we're also on 169 ping I
[03:27:34] am not farming fla living pure water I
[03:27:37] don't need help forms in this way shall
[03:27:41] watch deliver your
[03:27:50] punishment the power of water is it
[03:27:53] ability to take I don't think I should
[03:27:56] co-op on this account it kind of defeats
[03:27:57] the challenge I can't lie I mean maybe
[03:28:00] but I think it's funnier if we
[03:28:06] don't light it up stand clear oh my God
[03:28:10] go f
[03:28:18] without Solid Ground terrestrial
[03:28:21] creatures become simply helpless Simply
[03:28:32] Delicious dude I [ __ ] hate this
[03:28:36] boss the power of water is its ability
[03:28:40] to take any shape
[03:28:47] wow midnight
[03:28:50] fantas I [ __ ] dodged I dodged I you
[03:28:53] literally watch that I dodged hello
[03:28:59] up that's just a ping moment that's just
[03:29:01] a ping
[03:29:02] moment that's actually just

[03:29:17] Horrors animalest
[03:29:22] 63 Bennett e Sol the
[03:29:25] sh Sol the
[03:29:28] Bennett I summon
[03:29:32] thee oh [ __ ] it I'm
[03:29:38] afraid worthless okay well what happens
[03:29:41] when you lose your
[03:29:43] foothold that still hit me it's fine I'm
[03:29:47] actually just going to bend it all to
[03:29:48] heal cuz I don't want to risk
[03:29:51] it your Bennett has no ER dude the
[03:29:53] problem with my Bennett is I don't know
[03:29:55] genuinely I don't know if I want to
[03:29:58] level festering anymore because I
[03:30:01] know I know that I want sapwood blade
[03:30:03] but I don't know if I'm actually going
[03:30:05] to ever do the RNR quest for sapwood
[03:30:08] blade so I don't know if I should just
[03:30:10] level it or if I'm ever going to
[03:30:12] actually do the quest to
[03:30:15] Anye how long do you think it takes chat
[03:30:17] if I'm like a speedrunner cuz I already
[03:30:19] know the L I can spam skip if you think
[03:30:20] I'm a speedrunner how long do you think
[03:30:22] it
[03:30:23] takes like I'm like the like as if I'm
[03:30:26] the LeBron James of genin the Michael
[03:30:31] Phelps 5
[03:30:34] hours surely not right as long as rain
[03:30:38] falls and rivers flow water all right F
[03:30:43] on three mats no five stars I probably
[03:30:46] should have waited this is actually
[03:30:47] unironically good uh unlucky I probably
[03:30:50] should have waited till I was ar50 but
[03:30:52] it is what it
[03:30:58] is first pattern is like 3
[03:31:04] hours okay okay okay okay okay we could

[03:43:48] it for next weapon we want fa sword but
[03:43:51] I yeah no none of these are worth it Su
[03:43:55] and Rosaria are good yes but I don't
[03:43:57] need sucros cons cuz I have C1 that's
[03:43:58] all that matters for Shia and we are we
[03:44:00] aren't playing Rosaria um but even if I
[03:44:03] did I would need C2 like C2 is like what
[03:44:05] I would want so but yeah I want a dendro
[03:44:10] fourstar on this account

[03:44:43] even if he is free there's no way this
[03:44:45] account doesn't take ya Yao there's no
[03:44:47] way there's literally no way there's
[03:44:48] literally no way there's just no
[03:45:02] way might as well kill the slimes I need
[03:45:05] mats okay I didn't get
[03:45:07] anything okay uh let's go do something
[03:45:10] efficient let's spend our resin we have
[03:45:10] a lot of resin we have five con resin um
[03:45:13] we're going to
[03:45:17] do maybe Spire of solitary
[03:45:24] Enlightenment chat is there any
[03:45:29] use um is there any use for this other
[03:45:33] than Shia on my account I don't think so
[03:45:35] the two-piece I wouldn't use on who's my
[03:45:37] other
[03:45:38] DPS sucros yeah no and then this is only
[03:45:42] fishal right cuz we're playing fishal
[03:45:44] SRO
[03:45:46] sucros dendro MC Shia
[03:45:50] farzon another anemo character question
[03:45:53] mark I don't know who and
[03:46:01] Bennett so it's really good for ya um
[03:46:04] it's really good for
[03:46:08] offishal
[03:46:16] Farm emblem for SRO I was thinking we
[03:46:19] strong box
[03:46:21] emblem we definitely need a four piece
[03:46:23] deepwood and I was thinking we give
[03:46:25] gilded creams to fishal that was my plan
[03:46:28] I was thinking we give guilded dreams to
[03:46:30] fishal but the problem is that golden
[03:46:34] troop is pretty cracked for
[03:46:38] her
[03:46:43] and
[03:46:44] if if I go
[03:46:48] Mara then this piece which is genuinely
[03:46:51] really good and this piece which is also
[03:46:52] really good given how low investment my
[03:46:54] account is would be uh reduced to off
[03:46:58] pieces so I wouldn't be able to use them
[03:47:01] which sucks so I'd have to run like this
[03:47:04] on maybe like
[03:47:07] yeah random sub St and I'm not sure if
[03:47:10] it's worth
[03:47:22] it I I have a good
[03:47:26] go I can't even use that on this account
[03:47:28] I don't have a dungo damage

[03:47:49] full Elemental Mastery build so what we

[03:48:02] going to level this one chat if this

[04:22:17] parasocial relationships i0 xart also
[04:22:21] aboba abob why are we rolling on Asia
[04:22:24] because uh I was thinking I wanted a
[04:22:26] free to playay account or another I just
[04:22:27] wanted another account and um I wanted
[04:22:30] another account and I was like well I
[04:22:32] might as well make it another server why
[04:22:33] would I make two accounts on the same
[04:22:34] server so yeah
[04:22:37] I should probably claim achievements on
[04:22:39] this account
[04:22:40] though okay I literally only have
[04:22:42] one wait never mind spoke too soon I
[04:22:45] have
[04:22:46] two
[04:22:50] unlucky let me Time s
[04:22:55] that wait there's a chest
[04:23:02] here yeah also if I if this account's
[04:23:06] good I can do like the abyss as it comes
[04:23:08] out or test whatever well I probably
[04:23:10] won't pull for every character but uh
[04:23:12] like I can Asia server has access to
[04:23:14] some stuff
[04:23:19] earlier I don't want to use my alts
[04:23:21] that's the only thing I don't like about
[04:23:22] exploring with Shia is like unless your
[04:23:24] other party members are cracked you have
[04:23:25] to use your burst for like random
[04:23:27] [ __ ]
[04:23:30] NPCs if it's useful I'll take it wait
[04:23:34] can I can I swim
[04:23:38] oh my God I
[04:23:40] can oh my easy
[04:23:44] achievement
[04:23:46] anyways what constellation is your dude
[04:23:49] you think I pulled for constellations we
[04:23:51] have a C6 bit somehow um but the rest is
[04:23:55] like pretty low con we have a
[04:23:58] C2 bet which is really good we'll C3 for
[04:24:01] some reason SRO C 0 official c0 which
[04:24:05] are the main ones are going to be
[04:24:12] using WOW was that a C5 Kaa no that was
[04:24:16] um no no k's not
[04:24:19] C5 I think traveler was
[04:24:25] C5 low key if we actually do pull I
[04:24:28] should probably buy like one of these
[04:24:30] characters probably fishal get another
[04:24:33] con although FAL C1 is bad but uh C2 [ __ ]
[04:24:38] six can also refine our black with
[04:24:43] full that's a little
[04:24:48] copium get more Opa I don't want shining
[04:24:56] Wing wait what the [ __ ]
[04:25:00] I I have rewards but I don't
[04:25:05] have
[04:25:26] um can teleport to Ryden domain I don't
[04:25:29] have Ryden unlocked bro Ryden is not
[04:25:33] here I don't even have Senora Senora's
[04:25:35] still alive and I hope she stays that
[04:25:46] way yeah I know you can quick start oh I
[04:25:50] don't think I need to though only farzon
[04:25:52] is uh the character that needs Scara in
[04:25:55] in my account she's the only like new
[04:25:56] character I'm
[04:25:57] using so I don't think I actually need
[04:25:59] to do um to Quick Start any weekly
[04:26:02] except maybe
[04:26:05] Scara
[04:26:13] should
[04:26:21] I I mean it's only for [ __ ] farzon I
[04:26:24] don't know if farzon actually cares
[04:26:26] about her Talent levels like her burst
[04:26:31] sure but we already have
[04:26:35] two
[04:26:41] what the [ __ ]
[04:26:42] hello I can't swim I
[04:26:52] guess we can beat we can beat scar on
[04:26:54] this account I'm pretty
[04:27:04] sure level eight burst is enough yeah
[04:27:06] that's what I'm
[04:27:07] saying I don't think we actually need to
[04:27:10] do this
[04:27:11] boss but the dream solvent's nice and
[04:27:14] the does this one give the the
[04:27:16] prototypes that are like the the black
[04:27:17] ones like the new ones this boss gives
[04:27:19] them right it's the sumaru one so it
[04:27:21] should so it's good it's worth doing we
[04:27:23] really need prototypes yeah yeah it's
[04:27:25] worth doing I think it's worth
[04:27:28] doing I wonder if there's a like are we
[04:27:31] going to use any other character that
[04:27:33] needs a new boss mat like APAP or some
[04:27:35] [ __ ] I don't think so I mean maybe like
[04:27:37] no I don't think so maybe ya what the
[04:27:39] [ __ ] does yao yao use I don't remember

[04:42:07] means also technically Lenny Lynette
[04:42:10] from I don't know how that counts if it
[04:42:12] I don't read lore but AR
[04:42:15] Lino word of advice so if I understand
[04:42:18] correctly is there anything else that
[04:42:20] means that we're getting our Lino
[04:42:22] seriously don't break the
[04:42:27] law the Damned will sooner die again
[04:42:30] than lay a hand they aren't harbingers
[04:42:31] they're children's foul mode okay well
[04:42:34] ignore what I said about cut that
[04:42:39] out where is
[04:42:41] Senora
[04:42:43] um
[04:42:44] sorry if I speak it's okay she's going
[04:42:47] to be revived chat she's coming back in
[04:42:49] 8.6 don't
[04:42:55] worry she 8.6 mark my
[04:42:59] words watch child Scara emote playable
[04:43:04] AR OTE has to be playable confirmed soon
[04:43:06] we're going to get Senora as an emote
[04:43:09] she's going to be revived From the Ashes
[04:43:11] playable in patch 6.2 and
[04:43:14] then I once considered keeping some pets
[04:43:17] in my office but we standing around
[04:43:19] she's going to use Vermilion no she
[04:43:22] won she's probably going to use Crimson
[04:43:24] witch actually what if she's cryo cuz
[04:43:26] isn't she cryo until she turns into the
[04:43:27] Crimson
[04:43:33] witch
[04:43:35] H
[04:43:40] anyways wait why is there
[04:43:47] no oh what if what if Senora you her
[04:43:53] skill is cryo and then her burst have
[04:43:57] you ever seen stickers no oh my God oh
[04:43:59] my God I'm a genius her skill and burst
[04:44:02] are cryo but then you charge attack you
[04:44:05] turn pyro like finina St stance change
[04:44:08] right [ __ ] Michael Jackson stance
[04:44:10] change then gains both abilities off
[04:44:12] cool down they're completely different
[04:44:13] on pyro so you have four abilities two
[04:44:15] characters in
[04:44:18] one's your on
[04:44:24] it those memories so dark and she uses
[04:44:28] Vermilion with d Leaf who damages your
[04:44:29] entire team with his void
[04:44:32] cockal get ready start farming now for
[04:44:34] version
[04:44:37] 8.6 she has cryo and Pyro and TCG then I
[04:44:40] was right I was
[04:44:47] right
[04:44:50] actually it could also be like skill as
[04:44:52] cryo burst as pyro think about that you
[04:44:55] can literally melt by
[04:45:03] yourself
[04:45:13] she gets revived by one HP if she dies
[04:45:15] in TCG wait
[04:45:24] really okay it's confirmed then that's
[04:45:27] their way of for shadowing that in
[04:45:29] version 6.8 when Senora comes back to
[04:45:32] life with one HP we have to heal her go
[04:45:35] on a quest to give finina the why did I
[04:45:38] say finina give Senora the love she
[04:45:39] deserves boom We heal her up boom she
[04:45:42] joins our party boom anti-villain hero
[04:45:48] playable mark my
[04:45:51] words mark my
[04:45:59] words and then we get dor Redemption no

[04:58:28] I mean no sub stats though unfortunate
[04:58:30] but at least you have em main stat
[04:58:32] that's good that's good yeah just your
[04:58:34] sand sucks balls pretty decent but you
[04:58:36] get crit more crit damage to make it
[04:58:38] more even your is good but you would
[04:58:39] want more crit damage as opposed to just
[04:58:41] but it's fine aaka you want amona Kushi
[04:58:44] be sure to r five this there's no reason
[04:58:45] not to unless you have way too much ER
[04:58:47] which you don't that ER is only fine if
[04:58:49] your R5 Amino maaga Yushi so be sure to
[04:58:52] R5 your Amino maaga Yushi to get more ER

[04:58:57] feather flower that's good feather very
[04:58:58] good uh Sands pretty good as well um I
[04:59:01] was going to say you would lack some
[04:59:02] attack substats but 20% here and your
[04:59:05] weapon do a lot of attack so don't sweat
[04:59:07] it that is great Sans ciret does have
[04:59:09] some crit rate that is pretty good
[04:59:11] overall very good but you would want
[04:59:12] more ER or just refine your amima Kushi
[04:59:14] to get more ER or
[04:59:20] energy Indonesia
[04:59:22] mention Round of

[05:00:01] not Hazel wait why thrilling Tales Plus
[05:00:04] Battery I created Another Universe and
[05:00:07] founded Paradise it could be Shang Ling
[05:00:09] but we don't have fav Lance so it's like
[05:00:11] hard to make her a
[05:00:20] battery we the only fav weapons we have
[05:00:23] are fav bow and fav we have like three
[05:00:25] fav codexes which is why a codex user
[05:00:27] could actually be not
[05:00:29] bad albo could work but I want to use a
[05:00:32] five star
[05:00:37] fishal
[05:00:40] could we could do FAL here and then B
[05:00:43] hyper blo instead this could work cuz
[05:00:46] FAL is a battery uh not as much as like
[05:00:48] suos though for
[05:00:54] Faron like this could work as

[05:05:03] thick curtain to cut some sound
[05:05:05] apparently it doesn't work though
[05:05:07] also I wanted to show this drawing but I
[05:05:10] can't show this too far
[05:05:15] whatever yeah I told you guys there's
[05:05:17] there's like literally Pham like there's
[05:05:19] like garbage in the room there's like a
[05:05:20] bunch of foam padding to like reduce the
[05:05:22] echo there's also a
[05:05:24] rug from some dude I don't know what the
[05:05:27] store
[05:05:28] was
[05:05:31] um
[05:05:33] I don't know from where exactly it's
[05:05:35] some it I know it was Middle Eastern
[05:05:36] because he sounded like my family
[05:05:38] but again then lay a hand on me we got
[05:05:41] like a rug it smelled nice and then he
[05:05:43] was like he was like cash or card if
[05:05:46] it's cash you don't have to pay tax or
[05:05:48] like he doesn't it's cheaper like 10%
[05:05:50] off or something cuz he doesn't have to
[05:05:51] pay taxes or whatever so I was like okay
[05:05:52] I'll do like you know like I was like
[05:05:54] sure cash but then I tipped him I just
[05:05:55] like left the bill cuz I was like you
[05:05:57] know he seems like a like a cool person
[05:05:58] and he's like oh let me oh you didn't
[05:06:00] have to let me give you gifts and he
[05:06:01] gave us like literally like six gifts
[05:06:03] I'm like dude what the I feel bad now my
[05:06:05] tip isn't even a tip anyways so we have
[05:06:07] to go back there but I have a rug
[05:06:10] tldr so free
[05:06:15] rug who uses cash in modern day yeah I
[05:06:18] know I use card for everything but I
[05:06:19] like to keep cash cuz
[05:06:21] like I like to keep it if I ever need to
[05:06:24] like tip people or sometimes like if I'm
[05:06:27] like in an artist alley like to pay
[05:06:28] artists is annoying to like use a card
[05:06:30] but usually in the states I don't have
[05:06:31] American money so I have to
[05:06:33] but in Canada I can or it's like na
[05:06:36] culture it's not na culture you don't
[05:06:38] have to tip people like that but it's
[05:06:39] like it's clearly like his family store
[05:06:42] for like a hundred years it's like I
[05:06:43] feel like he's probably work he's
[05:06:44] probably working hard and not making
[05:06:47] like enough given he was like super
[05:06:49] charismatic so like you know I make
[05:06:52] money from screaming in a basement like
[05:06:53] it's like I don't
[05:06:56] know assuming I mean it's true they told
[05:06:59] me
[05:07:01] after same with like Hotel uh like
[05:07:04] workers like dude I feel like they do
[05:07:06] like nasty [ __ ] so like anytime it's
[05:07:08] like they like uh like ask for something
[05:07:11] they bring it up I I I I say I tip but
[05:07:13] like half the time I don't have American
[05:07:15] money so I I don't know but if I'm here
[05:07:17] I do anyways we're going to do a domain
[05:07:19] I don't know what domain we should do
[05:07:20] should probably turn Co-op off

[05:10:57] 75023 I created Another Universe and
[05:11:00] founded Paradise for I
[05:11:03] s w 0514 I don't even want to look this
[05:11:11] up okay let

[05:11:24] me how do you even find
[05:11:30] this this this is
[05:11:33] a should I buy this it's actually not
[05:11:36] that expensive it was
[05:11:38] $11 dude I don't look like
[05:11:42] this I created another
[05:11:45] univ no for IAL and the
[05:11:49] princess I don't look like
[05:11:53] that you can't just say something that's
[05:11:55] not true and then type
[05:12:00] true
[05:12:03] God damn it dude this wait [ __ ] it's a
[05:12:07] fourar
[05:12:08] man could be good though I should go
[05:12:10] again true ABA I'm not no I
[05:12:24] don't is this even worth doing this
[05:12:26] domain chat like I feel like I don't
[05:12:29] even know if it's efficient cuz twopiece
[05:12:32] twopiece might just be
[05:12:37] better wait what's the exact what's the
[05:12:39] percentage increase I I remember we did
[05:12:41] the math or someone in my Discord did
[05:12:43] the math of official going from two
[05:12:46] piece two piece to that isn't it like
[05:12:48] 18% or
[05:12:51] something it's 10% from gilded
[05:12:55] dreams but what is it from twopiece
[05:12:57] twopiece is it close to 20 if it's close
[05:12:59] to 20 it might be worth
[05:13:00] it cuz fil actually does pretty good
[05:13:08] damage
[05:13:14] [ __ ] bro is on Berserker
[05:13:17] okay [ __ ] you
[05:13:21] disappear
[05:13:25] worthless
[05:13:29] worthless
[05:13:30] worthless
[05:13:32] cuz the thing is we don't really need
[05:13:34] other we need a deepwood sand that's it
[05:13:37] that's that's literally it because we
[05:13:39] have the other pieces and you don't need
[05:13:41] good substats on it all you need is it
[05:13:42] to work it doesn't have to have good sub
[05:13:44] stats and then all we need for oh no all
[05:13:48] we need for other DPS characters are
[05:13:50] well vescent for sucros which we have
[05:13:52] cuz em is just the main stat like we
[05:13:54] don't need sub stats we already have
[05:13:55] that and then for Shia we need either
[05:13:57] TWP twopiece or M Hunter which would be
[05:14:00] about 10% DPS increase which
[05:14:02] probably is worth it but I'm not
[05:14:06] sure this is our ar47 free playay count
[05:14:09] chat that's why our damage is low okay
[05:14:11] you are not allowed to C W because uh
[05:14:13] it's still better than your damage sorry
[05:14:16] maybe it isn't I'm
[05:14:21] sorry I wish the better you were at
[05:14:23] genin the higher your numbers were like

[05:14:38] wait this actually good damage on
[05:14:41] ironically I swear if you can hit both
[05:14:43] of your plunges with SH he's so good but
[05:14:45] if you only hit one he feels like like a

[05:31:04] get enough attack right surely we're
[05:31:05] going Vermillion no we're not I guess
[05:31:07] that's fair we but the thing with Shang

[05:36:30] uh H honors list by the way no big deal
[05:36:33] uh no big deal no big deal anyways uh

[05:36:40] everything cuz there's they're like
[05:36:41] they're stupid so they make you study
