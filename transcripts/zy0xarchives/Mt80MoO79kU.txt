[00:12:29] fob can I call
[00:12:31] you hello as a law student legally I'm
[00:12:34] not allowed to call myself your lawyer
[00:12:36] but I'm going to say I am your lawyer uh
[00:12:38] you said the following words I see why
[00:12:40] people might hate you that could be
[00:12:41] taken as oh so people should tell me to
[00:12:43] kill myself and you are going to no I
[00:12:45] don't mean that obviously no say saved W
[00:12:49] lawyer give him chance to explain
[00:12:51] himself W lawyer because the the react
[00:12:54] streets are dangerous right now the
[00:12:55] react Street right now are oh oh okay
[00:12:58] okay okay okay I don't think anybody
[00:13:01] should hate him there was a [ __ ]
[00:13:03] quote tweet to mine where they literally
[00:13:05] said tech people like tekon shouldn't be
[00:13:08] alive yeah don't type that that that's
[00:13:11] ridiculous what the [ __ ] are you saying
[00:13:14] you know that's too far but you know
[00:13:18] like definitely I'm saying not but I'm
[00:13:21] not saying but yo why do someone in this
[00:13:22] gu in this in this [ __ ] short [ __ ]
[00:13:24] chat sorry fob type Zio is fb's lawyer
[00:13:27] we lost said I'm saying right
[00:13:29] the way he does word things come off
[00:13:31] quite aggressive you know you want to
[00:13:33] know what's [ __ ] I swear this [ __ ]
[00:13:35] okay this is going to sound [ __ ] clip
[00:13:37] it if you want I don't care it's almost
[00:13:38] a badge of honor now that people rub
[00:13:40] like oh well now I'm getting death
[00:13:42] threats I literally get a death threat
[00:13:43] for posting a guy someone DM me
[00:13:45] yeah okay dude it's so [ __ ] right now
[00:13:49] anyways is what it is well okay the full
[00:13:53] context
[00:13:55] um in my brain I blend [ __ ] and death
[00:13:58] threat they're not the same thing so
[00:14:00] apologies for using them interchangeably
[00:14:02] but the comments on uh uh guides are
[00:14:04] crazy right now uh I don't need to talk
[00:14:06] about it but they are crazy so if you
[00:14:08] like my videos go support them if you
[00:14:10] don't don't that's fine too uh the best
[00:14:13] way to show hate to a Creator is not to
[00:14:15] click on a video if you click on it to
[00:14:16] dislike or type a comment it gives
[00:14:18] interactions so just know that as a
[00:14:20] general thing if you hate me or hate
[00:14:22] someone else like you know don't be mean
[00:14:24] to people but that's the best way uh
[00:14:26] anyways uh so I called W lawyer W friend
[00:14:31] um yeah the badge of honor thing is is I
[00:14:35] think no one should ever under any
[00:14:37] circumstance tell people to off
[00:14:39] themselves ever I just see a lot of
[00:14:41] people being like like a lot of like
[00:14:43] I've seen this like at least 10 times
[00:14:45] people being like Oh well I got a like a
[00:14:47] death threat from those people so
[00:14:48] they're the bad people and then their
[00:14:50] people go and death threat those people
[00:14:52] and then it's literally like back and
[00:14:53] forth like it's like so weird but it is
[00:14:55] what it is I'm not it is what it is I
[00:14:57] mean not it isn't what it is it
[00:14:58] shouldn't be like that but yeah anyways
[00:15:01] um over a game well the thing is
[00:15:05] actually I made myself popcorn because I
[00:15:08] don't feel like talking because uh as a
[00:15:10] law student you learned that talking can
[00:15:12] incriminate you and there's no reason to
[00:15:14] incriminate yourself over a video game
[00:15:16] so what I'm going to do is be a popcorn
[00:15:18] streamer today and we are going to watch
[00:15:21] um can we stop lying about shun which I
[00:15:23] mostly I haven't watched it but I think
[00:15:25] I'm going to disagree with and then uh
[00:15:27] the follow-up video that he made F
[00:15:29] Master called out techone hard and we're
[00:15:30] just going to eat popcorn because I you
[00:15:33] know it's
[00:15:33] Ed this is crazy wait what should we
[00:15:36] start with I initially gave my I this
[00:15:38] one all right um there's some drama I
[00:15:41] was just here doing a little bit of my
[00:15:42] Daily Grind and then I saw that fob
[00:15:45] Master went in popcorn right uh which
[00:15:49] now I actually discussed this in my
[00:15:50] video earlier because I kind of called
[00:15:54] Tech count out a bit I said you know
[00:15:56] sometimes the way he says things it can
[00:15:59] weaponize um audiences a little bit and
[00:16:02] people catch Strays is is kind of the
[00:16:04] comment that I made because tectone will
[00:16:07] say and he mentions it here don't you
[00:16:11] know attack anyone if they love gench an
[00:16:13] impact but then says don't attach one if
[00:16:16] they love get impa
[00:16:19] okay unrelated to
[00:16:21] this I've got an attack for making a
[00:16:24] guide in which I didn't say I like dine
[00:16:26] and in which I did say um
[00:16:29] don't pull for the you don't have to
[00:16:30] pull for this don't feel pull forced to
[00:16:31] pull for this character play who you
[00:16:33] like like that I don't say that this
[00:16:36] patch I say that every character about
[00:16:37] it but you know don't harass anyone
[00:16:39] impact content creators are paid shells
[00:16:41] essentially well let me rewind I didn't
[00:16:42] really hear gen impa content creators
[00:16:45] are paid shills essentially and then and
[00:16:48] and they're faking it so they obviously
[00:16:50] don't like it and and it causes people
[00:16:52] to get you know pretty pretty riled up
[00:16:54] and fob said here is the tech tone cycle
[00:16:58] if you enjoy enjoy the game enjoy it but
[00:17:00] then implies to his audience that
[00:17:01] content creators are just faking
[00:17:03] enjoyment which is what I said last
[00:17:05] night is is it tends to be that people
[00:17:08] online will hear something and then and
[00:17:12] and even if you didn't specifically say
[00:17:14] hey go bug those creators they just do
[00:17:16] it anyways because they have their own
[00:17:18] free will and unfortunately some people
[00:17:21] are are terrible and so even if he
[00:17:23] didn't plan for it um it
[00:17:26] happens and he can't can't
[00:17:29] necessarily say well what my audience
[00:17:33] does I like I can't control that
[00:17:38] but okay I'm going to say
[00:17:40] something and this will get me [ __ ]
[00:17:42] down in the
[00:17:43] anus but if you're like rarely involved
[00:17:47] in controversies and then something
[00:17:48] happens and you're like oh [ __ ] I didn't
[00:17:49] expect that it's like it's not
[00:17:52] understandable it's not justifiable but
[00:17:53] like okay live and learn but if you're
[00:17:55] always involved in them you should
[00:17:57] expect what the outcome is like you
[00:17:59] should know what anything is going to
[00:18:01] not anything but a lot of things are
[00:18:02] going to everyone has influence anyway
[00:18:04] popcorn that's why they call us
[00:18:06] influencers and so if I said yo I think
[00:18:10] everyone should really go into like this
[00:18:13] look what well I think what you saying I
[00:18:15] said yo I think everyone should really
[00:18:18] go into env's stream today and just say
[00:18:21] damn you look good even if a a handful
[00:18:24] of people do that I bet a lot of people
[00:18:26] would do that and um
[00:18:29] if I told everyone to go and envy O's
[00:18:30] stream and said you know what I think
[00:18:32] Envy is is kind of a piece of trash man
[00:18:34] like I just don't like his attitude his
[00:18:37] thick booty is just it's too much for me
[00:18:39] it's like jealousy might go in there
[00:18:41] boot thicker and I think I do have some
[00:18:46] some say in that the way I talk about
[00:18:49] other people uh the way I talk about
[00:18:51] certain topics will cause other people
[00:18:53] to maybe lash out or do something and so
[00:18:55] you got to be careful we got big
[00:18:56] audiences and I even called that out in
[00:18:58] my video he said I get for some people
[00:19:01] uh this is their livelihood but then
[00:19:03] makes a video calling content creators
[00:19:04] Hypocrites for continuing their
[00:19:07] livelihood this is
[00:19:09] a this is a tough one this is an
[00:19:11] interesting one because yeah um a lot of
[00:19:14] people are stuck in games they are stuck
[00:19:17] covering something I mean I've been in
[00:19:18] the gacha world for quite a long time
[00:19:20] longer than I really expected because
[00:19:22] you know I was scared going to Diablo My
[00:19:24] Views were dropping they ended up doing
[00:19:26] okay long term but I looked at the start
[00:19:28] contrast and the the audience retention
[00:19:30] and how many people are clicking it I
[00:19:32] was like oh God and I got scared I'm not
[00:19:33] going to lie I also didn't love Diablo
[00:19:36] that's a whole another tangent but um a
[00:19:38] lot of people they get into a niche and
[00:19:40] they are stuck there for quite a long
[00:19:42] time and so um within said Niche you got
[00:19:47] to be you got to be um also recognizing
[00:19:51] that the other content creators in the
[00:19:53] niche are kind of like your co-workers
[00:19:55] and your colleagues and there is
[00:19:57] definitely some clashing going on teone
[00:20:00] someone said I didn't know there was CC
[00:20:02] drama like that it's not CC drama it's
[00:20:03] just like a if you're against if you're
[00:20:05] not with us you're against us but over
[00:20:07] genin which like you
[00:20:09] know no comment I'm just eating popcorn
[00:20:11] is definitely in one camp and and the
[00:20:14] other content creators they don't get
[00:20:16] along we know this I've I've seen it
[00:20:18] multiple times where where you know they
[00:20:20] they starts to be arguments and things
[00:20:22] like that and uh I think that just
[00:20:24] apathy and just like ignoring each other
[00:20:26] is probably safe like obviously they're
[00:20:28] not going to see eye to eye um but at
[00:20:30] the same time you know we also have to
[00:20:31] be careful that
[00:20:33] that you know it doesn't get to the
[00:20:35] point of like fighting causing causing
[00:20:38] drama because again content like this or
[00:20:41] or comments like this calling them
[00:20:43] Hypocrites and and saying oh they're not
[00:20:44] with us to to try and fix genin they're
[00:20:48] part of the problem that is potentially
[00:20:51] weaponizing a lot of people that is that
[00:20:53] is that is putting a lot of people uh
[00:20:56] you know getting aggressive so he he
[00:20:58] also says man also can contradicts
[00:21:00] himself constantly in order to cover his
[00:21:02] ass but then ignores his own
[00:21:04] contradictions to passively aggressively
[00:21:06] slander other CC's if you truly believe
[00:21:09] what you're saying stop covering
[00:21:11] yourself with contradictions and full
[00:21:13] send little bro all right fob going in
[00:21:15] here he also says if you believe that
[00:21:18] gench and C's really hate the game say
[00:21:20] it stop saying oh if you really enjoy
[00:21:23] the game enjoy it then turn around and
[00:21:25] passively aggressively call CC's fake
[00:21:28] um it's it's the thing I said in my
[00:21:30] video as well it's the argument tactic
[00:21:32] or or it's it's um it's a way of almost
[00:21:36] doing like a red herring or a or a straw
[00:21:39] man argument your chewing is Extremely
[00:21:42] Loud or is it that loud should I restart
[00:21:43] the video sorry chat I'll back up the
[00:21:46] mic don't bug content creators that love
[00:21:48] the game
[00:21:50] however most content creators are paid
[00:21:53] shills so they must be Faking It
[00:21:56] thus is it okay
[00:21:58] to harass dude it's so funny it's
[00:22:01] actually hilarious cuz I'll make a video
[00:22:03] being like I'll make a video I'll make a
[00:22:06] video I swear to God by the way this is
[00:22:08] all 100% true I'll make a video being
[00:22:10] like wait let me pause alerts I
[00:22:11] appreciate it those thanks for Subs I'll
[00:22:12] make a video being like yo by the way
[00:22:15] guys let me think about my words a
[00:22:17] little so the popcorn good I'll make a
[00:22:19] video being like yo by the way guys I
[00:22:22] think it's great to ask for like you
[00:22:24] know to complain about [ __ ] ask for more
[00:22:26] content keep asking don't shut up it's
[00:22:28] okay to be negative it's encouraged to
[00:22:29] be negative and Stu it's encourage to be
[00:22:30] like it's cool to be positive and stuff
[00:22:31] you know all that [ __ ] and people will
[00:22:33] be like Oh I thought you were not going
[00:22:35] to play genin anymore oh what about the
[00:22:37] boycott [ __ ] do you even know
[00:22:40] what
[00:22:42] sorry also it's like are you boycotting
[00:22:45] genjin or are you working horvers cuz if
[00:22:46] you're boycotting horvers that makes
[00:22:47] sense it's like okay [ __ ] the company
[00:22:49] that's like spitting in our face I get
[00:22:50] it but you're boycotting genin and
[00:22:52] you're spending your money on their
[00:22:53] other
[00:22:54] game who's getting hurt it's just like
[00:22:58] people fighting each other it's just oh
[00:23:00] cc is um CC needs to make a guide
[00:23:06] well right the munching is crazy that's
[00:23:09] where it gets dicey because people are
[00:23:10] going to take it one way even if you
[00:23:12] don't say it that's what you got to you
[00:23:14] got you got to consider just because you
[00:23:16] cannot fathom why they might enjoy it
[00:23:18] does not mean you know they aren't and
[00:23:21] that is fair as well I already said
[00:23:23] Fontaine terrible update for me because
[00:23:26] I did not like the underwat stuff it was
[00:23:29] beautiful was awesome it was it was an
[00:23:32] experience but it wasn't enjoyable and I
[00:23:34] wasn't stimulated because I like to
[00:23:36] fight challenging things and the last so
[00:23:39] and sucking up the creatures and
[00:23:40] shooting up their bubbles to kill stuff
[00:23:42] underwater it felt like it was
[00:23:44] mitigating all my units it just didn't
[00:23:46] feel like a good update for me who likes
[00:23:48] building different teams and and testing
[00:23:50] different things and so I didn't like it
[00:23:53] like but I know some people loved it
[00:23:54] they loved dolphin diving out the water
[00:23:56] and and they they thought it was great
[00:23:58] content and so I can see why people like
[00:24:03] it and if someone was like man I can't
[00:24:08] believe why you don't like Fontaine
[00:24:11] mtashed I'm not going to be like well
[00:24:12] you're an idiot you don't maybe they
[00:24:15] they are in from a you know from a very
[00:24:17] different perspective than me maybe they
[00:24:19] are a very Casual Gamer or you know
[00:24:21] maybe they's someone who likes more like
[00:24:24] Zelda or Animal Crossing or or stardew
[00:24:27] Valley and cozy games and the swimming
[00:24:29] and the new world and the otter under
[00:24:31] the water is very cool to them it's a
[00:24:33] it's a visual experience there's some
[00:24:35] games I think there might be something
[00:24:37] more important to boycott wait
[00:24:39] really
[00:24:42] really cuz
[00:24:44] like what what's causing more harm a
[00:24:47] genocide or three Fates
[00:24:50] h i mean that's not to say like
[00:24:53] obviously we should get way more rewards
[00:24:54] obviously like obviously but like
[00:24:59] it's like that's the thing
[00:25:03] like it's okay I'm just going to keep
[00:25:05] going that are essenti visual experience
[00:25:07] and they just look really cool and it's
[00:25:09] like obviously for me who likes to beat
[00:25:13] up bosses something like that might not
[00:25:14] be this crazy thing but for other people
[00:25:16] they really enjoy doing that and you
[00:25:19] know a sign side tangent to that I have
[00:25:23] never been someone that watches a ton of
[00:25:24] shows or even movies I have probably
[00:25:28] seen way less movies than the average
[00:25:30] person Watching Me by a large margin if
[00:25:32] I like I've been really trying not to
[00:25:34] say this cuz I don't
[00:25:36] like I don't like talking about another
[00:25:38] thing when people talking about one
[00:25:39] thing cuz then it's like minimize like
[00:25:41] look rewards are important you shouldn't
[00:25:43] [ __ ] suck a company's C and make them
[00:25:46] feel like you're always going to play
[00:25:47] their game so they treat you like [ __ ]
[00:25:48] you always should do that right I'm the
[00:25:50] only [ __ ] who still talks about
[00:25:51] de I made a de guide no one mentions her
[00:25:54] anymore I still think she needs a buff I
[00:25:56] I do she got better with like like
[00:25:57] there's a lot of things I always
[00:25:58] complain about but people will comment
[00:26:01] when I make a guide be like what about
[00:26:02] the boycott it's like what do you mean
[00:26:03] what about the did I say I made a video
[00:26:05] talking about it being honest and
[00:26:06] expressing my thoughts it wasn't for
[00:26:08] [ __ ] clicks I don't give a [ __ ] it's
[00:26:09] not going to benefit me no one from that
[00:26:11] video is going to like subscribe and
[00:26:12] watch my guides maybe but like it
[00:26:13] doesn't [ __ ] matter you're going to
[00:26:14] search the new character anyways right
[00:26:16] it doesn't matter but I was just like
[00:26:19] hey like I think it's good to complain
[00:26:20] keep doing it you know the unfollowing
[00:26:21] in China all that [ __ ] is good it's it's
[00:26:23] beneficial but that doesn't mean you
[00:26:24] can't play the game if you're not happy
[00:26:26] like if you like the game play the game
[00:26:27] but like if you don't like it don't play
[00:26:28] it don't spend money if you want to you
[00:26:32] like I'm not going to [ __ ] tell you
[00:26:33] what to do but be like oh what about
[00:26:34] boycotting what about I
[00:26:37] don't I haven't said that word
[00:26:41] once and personally I have been
[00:26:43] boycotting things I don't bring it up on
[00:26:44] stream because I like to keep stream
[00:26:46] positive and happy stuff and I don't
[00:26:48] like to always talk about [ __ ] if I
[00:26:50] don't feel like it I wanted to just be a
[00:26:51] happy place where I could do whatever
[00:26:52] the [ __ ] I want if I want to complain
[00:26:54] about things like I often times do I
[00:26:56] will if I don't feel like if I want to
[00:26:57] just [ __ ] play the game for a day and
[00:26:59] not have to think about [ __ ] that makes
[00:27:01] me sad then I won't do
[00:27:03] that I don't talk about a lot this [ __ ]
[00:27:05] publicly I declined I don't even know if
[00:27:07] I can say this I'm going to say it I
[00:27:08] declined a 30k sponsorship of a brand
[00:27:12] that like it was already negotiated it
[00:27:13] was going to I was going to do the
[00:27:15] [ __ ] sponsored stream and then I
[00:27:16] didn't because the [ __ ] I mean it
[00:27:19] turns out they're funding the [ __ ]
[00:27:20] Israel army to [ __ ] shoot people so I
[00:27:23] was like okay maybe I shouldn't do the
[00:27:24] sponsorship so minus 30k I could have
[00:27:26] done it said it was agreed upon a long
[00:27:27] time ago I don't bring this up publicly
[00:27:29] because why would I I'm not doing this
[00:27:30] [ __ ] I'm doing this for me I think it's
[00:27:32] the right thing to do so I do it but now
[00:27:33] it's like oh what about the boycott for
[00:27:35] releasing a guide in genin like I get it
[00:27:38] don't play the game don't I even say you
[00:27:39] don't have to pull like I say it in the
[00:27:41] video you don't have to get her don't I
[00:27:43] don't care don't even watch My Stream I
[00:27:44] don't like it's just what do you want me
[00:27:45] to do not make videos not play the game
[00:27:47] like I don't think I'm entertaining
[00:27:48] enough to stream [ __ ] watching paint
[00:27:51] dry it's like a lot of people aren't
[00:27:52] maybe you are maybe you watching this
[00:27:54] are I'm not so I'm going to play what I
[00:27:56] want to play I'm going to stream what I
[00:27:57] want stream but
[00:27:58] like why would I get hate for releasing
[00:28:01] a guide I know I'm getting one guide I
[00:28:03] know it doesn't matter that's why I'm
[00:28:04] not actually like I don't care like I
[00:28:06] care obviously but like you know if I'm
[00:28:08] being reasonable it's a one guy it
[00:28:09] doesn't matter but it's like bro like
[00:28:12] what like realistically cuz I've looked
[00:28:14] at comments on both games realistically
[00:28:16] it's like oh genjin Creator oh oh well
[00:28:18] [ __ ] you star real Creator based okay
[00:28:21] but like you're spending the money like
[00:28:23] if I make a guide for Black Swan and I
[00:28:25] probably will because I I genuinely play
[00:28:27] the game I just mostly play it off
[00:28:28] stream because it's for me I I don't
[00:28:30] like streaming it as much it's harder to
[00:28:32] be like funny while I'm streaming starv
[00:28:34] I have to think
[00:28:36] more do you think I'm like if what if I
[00:28:39] lose my 50-50 like I have to spend money
[00:28:41] to get her or I can't make the guide so
[00:28:43] it's like okay well am I allowed to
[00:28:45] spend money there but not on genin or
[00:28:47] like am I am I allowed to make a guide
[00:28:48] for Star but not genin or is it both are
[00:28:50] bad okay if both are bad because if only
[00:28:51] one's bad then that's the argument in my
[00:28:53] opinion doesn't really make sense
[00:28:55] because you're still paying the same
[00:28:56] company and you could argue well well
[00:28:57] then they'd they'd see one of their
[00:28:59] games doing well and the other not sure
[00:29:01] but I still think that you're feeding
[00:29:03] the same company and then if you're like
[00:29:04] okay well boy got the whole company then
[00:29:05] it's like well what am I like if you're
[00:29:08] saying Z I believe in you you could go
[00:29:10] stream [ __ ] Elden ring for a living
[00:29:12] and make it then thank you I don't
[00:29:14] believe that but that would be cool but
[00:29:17] what else so don't make G videos don't
[00:29:19] make Star real
[00:29:20] videos what do I do just make content
[00:29:23] being like well you know [ __ ] this
[00:29:25] company and I made one where I was I
[00:29:27] didn't say that but I said hey I don't
[00:29:30] like the way we're being treated we
[00:29:31] should complain about it but I'm also
[00:29:32] going to enjoy the things that I
[00:29:34] enjoy and knew back to
[00:29:36] popcorn I watched 10% of the movies
[00:29:39] you've watched I'd honestly be surprised
[00:29:41] or even animes because I I can't just
[00:29:43] sit there and watch a show and I don't
[00:29:45] know if it's ADHD or what but I love
[00:29:47] playing games and I've probably played
[00:29:49] more games than anyone watching this I
[00:29:53] have with 10 20 30 hours
[00:29:59] he went up to me was talking about
[00:30:01] RuneScape likes shooter games strategy
[00:30:04] games RPGs I play everything if you name
[00:30:08] a game I have probably are lies about
[00:30:10] you it doesn't matter realistically
[00:30:12] think about it okay if someone doesn't
[00:30:14] like me someone doesn't like me like
[00:30:15] it's not a big deal I don't think we
[00:30:17] should be like creators audiences
[00:30:19] shouldn't go harass other creators
[00:30:20] audiences and you can say like hey guys
[00:30:22] don't go harass them but then at the end
[00:30:23] of the day if the whole comment section
[00:30:25] is people being like oh well you know
[00:30:26] you say you wouldn't play the game when
[00:30:28] that's not what you said and then it's
[00:30:29] just that it's like it's going to happen
[00:30:31] so it's like there's no re like I don't
[00:30:32] care like I'm not going to get mad at
[00:30:34] anyone I don't give a
[00:30:35] [ __ ] I say I don't care obviously I care
[00:30:37] like obviously it affects me but it's
[00:30:40] like my
[00:30:42] my what I want to do is not like hm how
[00:30:47] do I word this like I'm not here to be
[00:30:50] like I like this person I don't like
[00:30:51] this person like I do my own [ __ ] and it
[00:30:53] is what it is and if I don't like
[00:30:54] someone that's fine I'm allowed to not
[00:30:55] like someone but I'm not going to be
[00:30:56] like well well my community can't like
[00:30:58] them like you guys do whatever you
[00:31:00] want it's out of your sphere of
[00:31:02] influence I don't think
[00:31:03] that's I'm going to be honest dude like
[00:31:06] if you've been involved in controversies
[00:31:08] you know like you genuinely know and
[00:31:09] like you know and if you have an
[00:31:11] audience you also know what words can do
[00:31:13] like it's m says this and I think he
[00:31:15] puts this pretty well I'm going to
[00:31:16] remember the time so I'm going to go
[00:31:17] back around here I think everyone should
[00:31:19] really go into envio stream today and
[00:31:22] just say damn you look good like if I
[00:31:24] say something example I don't want to
[00:31:26] use Envy like I don't want to use a real
[00:31:29] well whatever let's say Mt if I'm say
[00:31:32] something like wow Mt you changed you're
[00:31:34] really fake now you just do whatever
[00:31:37] like you just play genin cuz you have to
[00:31:38] play genin or like no that's not even
[00:31:40] mean but like whatever I say to 4,000
[00:31:43] 400 people right now at least 500 people
[00:31:46] might think it maybe 100 people 10
[00:31:49] people go say that to him it's like you
[00:31:51] know okay it's going to be more than 10
[00:31:53] like you know that's going to happen
[00:31:54] it's like you can't obviously it's not
[00:31:56] your like if one of your fans goes and
[00:31:59] tells them to [ __ ] off himself that's
[00:32:00] not okay and that's not necessar like
[00:32:02] that's not me like I didn't like
[00:32:03] obviously don't do that but it's like
[00:32:05] you know what using certain language
[00:32:08] will do that's just it is what it is
[00:32:09] like it is what it is and that's okay
[00:32:12] like if you like do whatever you want
[00:32:13] but like you like you can't argue that
[00:32:16] you don't know what certain language
[00:32:17] will do like you just can't argue
[00:32:21] that but you also literally said sure
[00:32:25] there are some CC's that should not
[00:32:27] leave genin because I'll be real genin
[00:32:31] made them there's nothing wrong with
[00:32:32] that which makes up 99% of the largest
[00:32:35] CCs in the space again if you start
[00:32:38] looking at the numbers dish life Chang I
[00:32:42] think that was me by the way Zio
[00:32:44] lifechanging growth me lifechanging
[00:32:46] growth I was a
[00:32:48] fullton like I have what 300,000
[00:32:51] followers I was doing fine but I went
[00:32:53] from making like maybe I know a couple
[00:32:58] hundred thousand a year to makeing like
[00:33:00] a couple million doll like it was it was
[00:33:03] crazy sh and it's pretty hard to stop
[00:33:07] doing that right and it's it's it's
[00:33:10] harder than to to transition in swap
[00:33:13] game like it's weird cuz like I know
[00:33:16] it's like oh like you're going to play
[00:33:17] Both Sides like I get it but it's like I
[00:33:19] genuinely believe that
[00:33:22] like if I really think deep down like
[00:33:25] about it it's like I feel like everyone
[00:33:27] wants positive things like you either
[00:33:29] want yeah you want more [ __ ] you want
[00:33:31] the game to be better no no no or you
[00:33:34] also want that but you you either stop
[00:33:36] playing the game or you continue playing
[00:33:37] the game but I feel like everyone wants
[00:33:39] that [ __ ] and if you don't that's weird
[00:33:40] but like do whatever you want but it's
[00:33:42] like bro
[00:33:44] like I don't know like is the goal that
[00:33:48] no one plays and no one pulls and if if
[00:33:50] that's the goal then like sure but like
[00:33:52] it should be applied to all of the
[00:33:53] company games and then if that's if that
[00:33:56] is really the goal then it's like well
[00:33:58] should people that make guides get
[00:33:59] harassed for it and if the answer is no
[00:34:02] then why is it happening well it's out
[00:34:04] of my control well okay but like it's
[00:34:06] happening a lot it's happening only on
[00:34:08] one game whatever like it is what it is
[00:34:11] because he is L of react of he plays a
[00:34:13] lot of different games has three 4,000
[00:34:15] viewers if I go play a different game
[00:34:17] sometimes I drop down to like 150
[00:34:19] viewers I go from like 800 to a, viewers
[00:34:22] on Twitch down to like what are we doing
[00:34:23] I'm hungry 150 and like that this video
[00:34:26] I want to watch this scary um and other
[00:34:28] creators are going well and
[00:34:31] so it is tough and like yeah genin did
[00:34:34] make them but like arguably it made
[00:34:37] teone he's just able to transition away
[00:34:40] easier than others but a lot of us EnV
[00:34:43] another one they didn't have a huge
[00:34:45] following and then blew up with the game
[00:34:48] and um you know there there's there's
[00:34:50] there's contracts that are in play with
[00:34:52] certain people so you know there there's
[00:34:54] maybe some requirements for how much
[00:34:56] they play and all all these different
[00:34:57] things um but you know it's again it's
[00:35:01] it's what he's saying here is like
[00:35:03] you're saying one thing but you're
[00:35:05] alluding to another that can be
[00:35:06] dangerous you acknowledge for the
[00:35:09] biggest CC's that this is their
[00:35:11] livelihood but you also call them
[00:35:13] Hypocrites for choosing to keep their
[00:35:15] livelihood
[00:35:16] intact as someone whose livelihood was
[00:35:19] saved off the backs of Miz and otk you
[00:35:22] should know better than to go for their
[00:35:25] livelihood
[00:35:28] Gamers everyone is trying to get paid
[00:35:30] everyone is trying to make Bank everyone
[00:35:32] is trying to protect their family and
[00:35:35] their lives all right no one wants to go
[00:35:38] to a job a lot of the times and luckily
[00:35:41] we've been blessed with a job that is
[00:35:42] arguably pretty damn cool and pretty
[00:35:44] damn
[00:35:45] cushy but it's still a job and we still
[00:35:50] sometimes are stressed out about it and
[00:35:52] don't want to play a game but we also
[00:35:54] recognize that we have maybe goals
[00:35:56] Financial requirements I've got a
[00:35:58] mortgage I got to pay we've got a house
[00:35:59] being built that I you know it's going
[00:36:01] to be expensive and I've got kids so
[00:36:03] someone like myself I'm very for that if
[00:36:06] someone's roasting me for playing a game
[00:36:09] that maybe I am a little burnt out on
[00:36:11] it's like yeah what do you want me to do
[00:36:13] instead do do you want me to jeopardize
[00:36:16] my family right I'll get riled up about
[00:36:18] a topic like this because it's like
[00:36:20] number one it's none of your business
[00:36:22] this is so weird cuz I disagree with so
[00:36:24] many of M takes but he feels like my
[00:36:26] father figure right now number two it is
[00:36:29] my livelihood and it is my family to
[00:36:31] protect and so as a dad it's like yeah I
[00:36:34] will do whatever the hell it takes to
[00:36:37] make sure my kids are getting their
[00:36:38] school paid for or or can have that
[00:36:41] sport they get to play or whatever it
[00:36:42] might be and I've been a dad since I was
[00:36:45] 17 18 years old I was a very young
[00:36:48] father with nothing I had no money I
[00:36:50] disagre oh no not this video I'm talking
[00:36:52] about like gench and takes like I
[00:36:54] usually like you like not like a
[00:36:55] character and I'll like them or vice
[00:36:57] versa I had $300 in the bank and I was
[00:37:00] scared out of my mind and so I want to
[00:37:02] protect whatever I have and I definitely
[00:37:06] can understand that you know the
[00:37:09] livelihood stuff you're crunching too
[00:37:11] loud sorry I feel like it shouldn't be
[00:37:13] anyone's business and and it shouldn't
[00:37:15] be a topic of contention because at the
[00:37:17] end of the day I understand if you're
[00:37:19] doing something crazy and nefarious like
[00:37:22] if you're doing um if you're doing like
[00:37:27] crazy crypto
[00:37:29] scams to pay the bills you're a piece of
[00:37:31] trash but if you're playing a video game
[00:37:34] that like maybe you're burnt out on come
[00:37:37] on is this something we should be
[00:37:38] attacking I don't I don't think so so
[00:37:41] I'm just going to be off but like so
[00:37:43] here's the
[00:37:44] thing this is going this is always I
[00:37:47] don't don't it's always well we
[00:37:48] shouldn't be attacking them but then
[00:37:50] they get attacked anyways so it's like
[00:37:52] you know is it someone's fault not
[00:37:54] necessarily but like it just it it
[00:37:56] happens when like that's the landscape
[00:37:58] when it's like hey we should like keep
[00:38:00] asking for change complain about stuff
[00:38:02] unfollow onear review like like maybe
[00:38:04] don't spend like don't pull but like but
[00:38:07] then if someone releases a guide and
[00:38:08] then everyone's like oh well they change
[00:38:09] oh they're fake it's like that's diff
[00:38:11] like is that not different is it not
[00:38:12] like doing what you f like are you going
[00:38:14] to force people to not spend or are you
[00:38:16] usually not going to not spend like are
[00:38:18] you like okay well Nestle [ __ ] wants
[00:38:21] uh uh I'm pretty sure the CEO wants
[00:38:22] water to not be a human right so are you
[00:38:24] like okay well anyone that drinks a
[00:38:25] nestly water bottle or a Nestle coffee
[00:38:27] or Nestle this is a [ __ ] [ __ ] or
[00:38:29] are you like well me I'm going to try
[00:38:30] not to buy it or do you not care and
[00:38:32] whatever like I would say that's up to
[00:38:34] you if you are like well there's a
[00:38:36] morally correct answer then do that I
[00:38:38] think there's a morally correct answer
[00:38:40] but I also know that n in particular you
[00:38:42] can't really I don't even know what's
[00:38:43] nestly anymore there's so many [ __ ]
[00:38:44] things it's it's j but you know what
[00:38:47] like you get my [ __ ] point with this
[00:38:50] it's like I with a video game I think
[00:38:52] it's hey we should get more rewards I do
[00:38:55] I genuinely believe it and this isn't
[00:38:56] just a star rail thing star rail shows
[00:38:58] you that you can get more rewards and
[00:38:59] that they're capable of giving it but
[00:39:00] I've been advocating since [ __ ] 1.0
[00:39:02] and the only reason I made a video is
[00:39:04] cuz [ __ ] are like oh well you
[00:39:05] only see it on Twitch where it's just
[00:39:06] your audience oh you only said it on
[00:39:07] Twitter where it is a much bigger
[00:39:08] Audience by the way but it's just your
[00:39:10] audience so I made it on YouTube and now
[00:39:11] they're like oh well you said you would
[00:39:12] to play the game I never said that I
[00:39:13] said I'm going to complain about things
[00:39:14] like I did now making it official and
[00:39:16] you guys should [ __ ] complain about
[00:39:17] things and I encourage you to keep
[00:39:18] complaining but I'm also going to be
[00:39:19] hype about some things and you should
[00:39:20] you can be hyp about some things you can
[00:39:22] be negative about some things and if you
[00:39:24] disagree with that well that's good for
[00:39:25] you like I'm not going to get matter you
[00:39:26] do what you want to do and let me do
[00:39:28] what I want to do if I want to [ __ ]
[00:39:29] play my game but also be critical about
[00:39:31] things then I'll do that and if you want
[00:39:33] to if you want to be happy and not care
[00:39:35] if you want to be mad that's fine both
[00:39:36] of them are fine I'm not saying it's
[00:39:37] just cool to be positive it's also cool
[00:39:39] to be like it's fine to be negative it's
[00:39:41] okay but like when there's like anyone
[00:39:44] that's making a guide that's being happy
[00:39:46] is Shilling something is [ __ ] a a
[00:39:48] cuck a this that it's like dude like
[00:39:50] like is this what we want the like
[00:39:52] content creator interactions to be like
[00:39:53] that's why I try to be friendly with
[00:39:54] everyone I know it's not possible I know
[00:39:56] realistically there's going to be people
[00:39:57] you can't really be friends with or you
[00:39:59] can't inter like you can't like or
[00:40:00] whatever but like I genuinely try to be
[00:40:02] cool with people because I I like to see
[00:40:04] the good in people I know that everyone
[00:40:06] involved wants better for the game or
[00:40:08] for themselves I know there's some bad
[00:40:09] faith actors but for the most part even
[00:40:11] if you say something like I think the
[00:40:14] way people word things is dangerous but
[00:40:16] I think a lot of times people mean well
[00:40:17] for the game or for whatever and that's
[00:40:19] fine and that's why I I'm like anyone
[00:40:21] that for the most part i' like to think
[00:40:23] I'm cool with or I would like to be cool
[00:40:25] with I know that's not realistic but a
[00:40:26] lot of times [ __ ] you do and [ __ ] you
[00:40:28] say has
[00:40:30] consequences is what it is don't think
[00:40:33] so so I'm just going to be up front
[00:40:34] there that's kind of how I feel about it
[00:40:36] at the end of the day genin CC's have
[00:40:38] voiced their complaints over the years
[00:40:40] but you neglect that cherry like example
[00:40:44] de was a [ __ ] show I constantly
[00:40:46] complained about de I made a guide no
[00:40:48] one was like oh hoo shill cuz I made a
[00:40:50] guide I make a shuun guide it's
[00:40:52] basically people oh can't believe you
[00:40:53] made a guy it's
[00:40:55] like they has a like arguably shouldn't
[00:40:58] be released in that state that is what I
[00:41:00] believe Shen Yun is a great character
[00:41:02] but don't pull cuz I get what's like I
[00:41:03] get it but it's like well this is this
[00:41:06] is
[00:41:07] fine but this
[00:41:14] isn't what the [ __ ] is the thing and
[00:41:17] build this false narrative that they're
[00:41:18] faking joyment for the game because it
[00:41:20] is tied to their livelihoods let's push
[00:41:23] for change without slandering others
[00:41:26] and I get where fob also you don't have
[00:41:28] to like is like people are like oh sad
[00:41:31] to see him Farm drama no it's not like
[00:41:32] he's doing well good views like good for
[00:41:34] him like it's all good like genuinely I
[00:41:37] wish success for people but I just don't
[00:41:38] like it when the way things are worded
[00:41:40] causes people to get harassed by other
[00:41:42] people and I know that both [ __ ]
[00:41:43] sides get harassed for this [ __ ] it's
[00:41:45] kind of the nature of it when it's an
[00:41:47] issue like this discussed in this way
[00:41:49] like it happens I wish it didn't and I
[00:41:51] don't want it to and maybe they in the
[00:41:54] past haven't said as much as others
[00:41:56] [Music]
[00:41:57] at the end of the day we're not forced
[00:42:00] or required to say something
[00:42:05] and can you argue
[00:42:07] that someone is on a contract doesn't
[00:42:10] want to speak out against genchi to
[00:42:11] protect that you can't really maybe
[00:42:14] trust their their critiques or or trust
[00:42:17] their opinions yeah you can argue that
[00:42:20] stuff absolutely someone protecting
[00:42:22] their livelihood can be compromised to
[00:42:25] the point where they aren't giving their
[00:42:27] full opinion y y y and I'm not saying
[00:42:30] that they are you can elude that that's
[00:42:32] what I'm saying
[00:42:36] but that's your decision to make if you
[00:42:39] think the content creators are
[00:42:40] compromised and you don't think that
[00:42:41] their opinions are valid then do what
[00:42:43] you're saying you know do whatever you
[00:42:44] want however if you do go and look and
[00:42:48] see you know Doro sorry let
[00:42:53] me uh somewhere he made a post like a
[00:42:57] big long text and he can be hyped up uh
[00:43:00] but but a lot of them are are retweeting
[00:43:02] and responding to these different things
[00:43:04] and and and making different comments
[00:43:05] and I understand that someone like Doro
[00:43:07] might be super positive I don't know
[00:43:09] Doro on a on a personal level but but if
[00:43:12] they have gone to the lengths of even
[00:43:14] tweeting anything negative that
[00:43:16] potentially could jeopardize a contract
[00:43:18] or or or anything like
[00:43:23] that why would they
[00:43:26] talk about the
[00:43:28] issues and give any sort of
[00:43:31] feedback if they didn't actually feel
[00:43:34] that right you know what I'm saying is
[00:43:37] like if you are a paid shill who can't
[00:43:41] talk
[00:43:42] negatively there would never be a tweet
[00:43:45] there would never be a clip on YouTube
[00:43:47] on Twitch anywhere it wouldn't exist
[00:43:49] because you are so in their pocket you
[00:43:51] are such a shill that you will never be
[00:43:54] SMG them you will never consider ruining
[00:43:56] the contract but there are a lot of
[00:43:58] content creators that you know get
[00:44:00] listed off as like hey they are
[00:44:02] absolutely in their pocket in in the
[00:44:04] Hoover's pocket that have made some
[00:44:06] tweets and some comments and so either
[00:44:09] they're not in the pocket as much as we
[00:44:10] think or they believe strongly enough
[00:44:12] about the topic that they do want to
[00:44:14] discuss it they've been harassed to the
[00:44:16] point where they are forced to discuss
[00:44:17] it or are various other reasons but at
[00:44:21] the end of the day I think we also
[00:44:24] continue to need to address this in some
[00:44:29] cases it does it matter does my opinion
[00:44:33] or Doros or EnV or tecton or anyone's
[00:44:36] matter is it going to change the game
[00:44:38] but also if they I actually think
[00:44:41] like I think the CN community's opinion
[00:44:44] M like I feel like their voices get
[00:44:45] heard more like this could be like just
[00:44:48] Fields crafting but like I feel like
[00:44:49] especially with like how Jang Lee got
[00:44:51] buffed and a lot of the times Hoya
[00:44:53] responds it's there because there's more
[00:44:55] whales
[00:44:56] like I still think any should like I
[00:44:58] think everyone should complain about
[00:44:59] things that they think they should
[00:45:01] complain
[00:45:02] about and I Tred to use my platform for
[00:45:06] good
[00:45:09] but you
[00:45:15] know if you go into a streamer playing a
[00:45:18] game and they're like bitching about not
[00:45:19] bitching sorry that's the wrong word
[00:45:21] [ __ ] on the game Non-Stop and
[00:45:22] complaining about it non-stop but
[00:45:23] they're playing the game because they
[00:45:25] like the game and you type stop playing
[00:45:27] this game why are you playing it if you
[00:45:29] don't like it type that in any big
[00:45:30] streamers chat Tyler one any valerant
[00:45:32] streamer any like they're going to ban
[00:45:34] you probably or you're just going to get
[00:45:35] kick wed it's like I know it's different
[00:45:39] when it's like I know it's I want to say
[00:45:42] there's a few things that make it
[00:45:43] different I want to say it's especially
[00:45:45] different when it's like a specific like
[00:45:48] a time when it's like okay well now I
[00:45:50] feel like I've been done
[00:45:52] dirty but still
[00:45:54] like
[00:45:58] don't give their opinion are they bad
[00:46:01] are they evil and I think that's where
[00:46:03] the line is being blurred here a little
[00:46:05] bit of like I understand like maybe
[00:46:08] someone's on vacation I was gone for a
[00:46:10] lot of this drama and people were like M
[00:46:12] why are you talking about the drama it's
[00:46:13] like brother I am in the mountain eating
[00:46:16] food and and and looking at at beautiful
[00:46:18] glaciers I I don't I just don't care I'm
[00:46:21] not an evil person for not caring about
[00:46:24] three wishes for the anniversary because
[00:46:26] honestly I expected at this point and
[00:46:28] honestly even if I this is actually
[00:46:35] like
[00:46:37] like
[00:46:40] yeah
[00:46:43] yeah and I think that's where the line
[00:46:45] is being blurred here a little bit of
[00:46:47] like I understand like maybe someone's
[00:46:50] on vacation I was gone for a lot of this
[00:46:51] drama and people were like M why are you
[00:46:53] talking about the drama it's like
[00:46:54] brother I am the mountain eating food
[00:46:57] and and and looking at at beautiful
[00:47:00] glaciers I I don't I just don't care I'm
[00:47:03] not an evil person for not caring about
[00:47:05] three wishes for the anniversary because
[00:47:07] honestly I expected at this point and
[00:47:09] honestly even if I did care and I said
[00:47:12] something I don't like I
[00:47:14] remember it was like a lot of it was
[00:47:17] like for a lot of people it's like okay
[00:47:19] well you talk like I I remember that
[00:47:21] this was a thing with Doro too where I
[00:47:22] was like okay well you talk on Twitch
[00:47:24] well you should make it a YouTube video
[00:47:25] so more people get like can hear it and
[00:47:27] like I get that use your platform that's
[00:47:29] not just your Twitch to spread hey we
[00:47:32] should get more rewards and if the
[00:47:34] Creator wants to do that or not is up to
[00:47:36] them but I get it that's actually why I
[00:47:38] did it I'm like you know what that's a
[00:47:39] fair point that's why I did I just gave
[00:47:41] my take but then if after me making a
[00:47:44] guide is oh well you're supposed to not
[00:47:45] play the game now I don't think that's
[00:47:47] fair and if you think that's what it
[00:47:48] should be then that's you know or you
[00:47:50] can't pull on the new character because
[00:47:52] well I have to make a guide for the new
[00:47:53] character it's like that's not how I
[00:47:55] feel and you're allowed to disagree with
[00:47:56] me I know if I matter but like if I'm
[00:47:58] making character guides for three
[00:48:01] years the pause was it if I'm making
[00:48:03] character guys for three years I'm not
[00:48:04] going to skip a [ __ ] character
[00:48:06] because like no not just one it would
[00:48:07] probably be because then it's like okay
[00:48:09] well if I skip one and then I have to
[00:48:10] also skip ging and then I can't do Nita
[00:48:11] reun and then I have to wait till the
[00:48:13] next patch and then next p like first of
[00:48:14] all it's like okay well can I do a star
[00:48:15] video well if I can then what's the
[00:48:17] point cuz it's the same company if I
[00:48:18] can't then okay then I don't make videos
[00:48:19] for whatever and then it's like well in
[00:48:21] the meantime if I'm either I don't make
[00:48:24] content and then it's like well can I go
[00:48:25] back next patch or do is that still
[00:48:26] hypocritical because what if they didn't
[00:48:28] give rewards next patch then do I just
[00:48:29] stop playing the game and then it's like
[00:48:30] okay well furthermore what if in two no
[00:48:32] not just in two patches but let's say
[00:48:34] well what would my content be then the
[00:48:35] only thing my content can be is well I
[00:48:37] quit genjin and star Rail and honai well
[00:48:40] I don't actually play Hony but and is
[00:48:42] that apathy potentially but I'm not a
[00:48:44] bad human being for being in the
[00:48:47] mountains when this all drops and if EnV
[00:48:49] oity was in Mexico if envi
[00:48:52] oity was watching a bunch of new anime
[00:48:56] and just not paying attention like is
[00:48:58] the guy evil for not responding right
[00:49:00] away no and we have to be careful to not
[00:49:04] just start dude I have a bunch of morus
[00:49:06] Mobius merch I have like a pin and like
[00:49:09] a stande over there and she has like
[00:49:11] dude she's so sick she literally lament
[00:49:13] and then she has the kakomi skin if you
[00:49:16] didn't talk about it bad if you have by
[00:49:18] hoe bad and I'm not defending them and
[00:49:22] calling them saints either but
[00:49:26] that's the issue is you can't just lump
[00:49:27] everyone together there's layers to
[00:49:29] these things these are people and once
[00:49:31] again whether I sound like a fence
[00:49:33] sitter or not I just don't love people
[00:49:38] fighting I I just don't want people
[00:49:41] arguing and attacking I would rather
[00:49:45] have a strong community that supports
[00:49:47] each other and collaborates and can do a
[00:49:49] video where I go on with Z Jeff and go
[00:49:51] listen I think this new character is
[00:49:53] kind of trash why you like and maybe
[00:49:55] that's dude but like this is what I dude
[00:49:58] I literally said this like almost
[00:49:59] verbatim that's why I said fight not
[00:50:01] kiss or kiss not fight and then like I
[00:50:04] literally said kiss not fight and it was
[00:50:06] turned into like oh well you want to
[00:50:07] silence people no I like genuinely
[00:50:09] please keep complaining and if you like
[00:50:11] I don't even encourage spending on the
[00:50:12] game like I I genuinely feel like not
[00:50:15] just now by the way since like as long
[00:50:17] as I can remember I want to say at least
[00:50:18] two years I almost always say yeah I
[00:50:20] don't feel forced to pull this character
[00:50:22] even kazua yeah you probably should get
[00:50:24] him but every time like you don't need
[00:50:25] them you don't need them this game's
[00:50:26] easy you don't need them
[00:50:28] always but you know let people that want
[00:50:31] to play and have fun have fun and let
[00:50:33] people that want to be mad and not play
[00:50:34] and complain like do that and I
[00:50:35] encourage everyone to voice their how
[00:50:38] they feel like to start doing is maybe a
[00:50:41] little bit more collaboration on my side
[00:50:43] is like listen um you know gacha gamer
[00:50:46] or or Z Jeff or or it's oh Z it's like
[00:50:49] imagine there's like okay imagine
[00:50:51] there's
[00:50:52] like big bad wolf that everyone's mad at
[00:50:56] right zos imagine there's like one thing
[00:50:59] people are mad at and then there's like
[00:51:01] two Nations right when the Fire Nation
[00:51:02] attacked and then the two nations are
[00:51:04] fighting each other instead of fighting
[00:51:05] the thing they're mad about cuz they're
[00:51:07] both mad about it but they're mad at it
[00:51:08] in different ways and then they're just
[00:51:09] fighting each
[00:51:10] other Z and be like hey yo please give
[00:51:13] me day buff please I'll kiss
[00:51:17] you my hands are so buttery liation on
[00:51:19] my side listen um you know gacha gamer
[00:51:23] or or zff or or zos or whoever it is is
[00:51:26] I'm seeing a character here and I'm just
[00:51:28] not impressed convince me otherwise and
[00:51:30] maybe that's a fun interactive thing is
[00:51:33] wait that's a banger video I'm tached
[00:51:35] wait Banger video can we do that wait
[00:51:38] actually Banger yo if you're here I know
[00:51:40] you're probably not here but Banger
[00:51:43] video dude this guy didn't like no
[00:51:45] disrespect I'm Das this guy didn't like
[00:51:47] well not didn't like but not to my like
[00:51:50] not didn't like as much as I did
[00:51:52] finina I would have Lov to talk about
[00:51:54] that I think same with shenyun but we
[00:51:56] haven't watched the video yet and I
[00:51:57] haven't really given my full take on
[00:51:59] shenyun so we could do that
[00:52:05] um you know almost like The Devil's
[00:52:07] Advocate thing Community things like
[00:52:09] that are great but it's a lot of work to
[00:52:12] collaborate and everyone's got their own
[00:52:14] schedules and again YouTube shows
[00:52:15] dislikes since when I have an extension
[00:52:17] to see it I think removing dislikes is a
[00:52:19] pretty bad thing because it's nice to be
[00:52:21] able to see
[00:52:23] right livelihoods
[00:52:26] and it's not anyone's you know business
[00:52:31] what that livelihood is or the decision
[00:52:33] decisions that they make it's sometimes
[00:52:35] it's just business and business I don't
[00:52:38] I don't want to persecute and and
[00:52:40] crucify people for their business
[00:52:43] decisions I've made lots of business
[00:52:45] decisions in my day I like I'd like I
[00:52:49] like money I've played games that I
[00:52:52] don't love for money and different
[00:52:53] things like that and
[00:52:56] I think that as long as as long as these
[00:52:59] people aren't
[00:53:01] like literally boot licking for Hoy
[00:53:04] overse constantly and being like if they
[00:53:07] were all tweeting out oh my God three
[00:53:10] wishes Yoo that's different but I don't
[00:53:15] think that's the case here
[00:53:17] so yeah think of that would you
[00:53:20] will I just want to De
[00:53:24] popcorn

[00:53:45] guide I didn't say I guess I always say
[00:53:48] [ __ ] this

[00:54:23] know man the only thing I I really about
[00:54:25] is like the main thing there's a lot of
[00:54:28] things I care about the main thing I
[00:54:29] care about is just I still I started
[00:54:32] playing this game to co-op and do
[00:54:33] hardship with my friends like and we
[00:54:34] still don't have it like I just that's
[00:54:36] the you know let me go wash my hands you
[00:54:38] know what I
[00:54:54] say
[00:55:05] scatter was fast yeah I washed these

[00:55:24] what it's about but I love
[00:55:26] lwig I'm such a lwig
[00:55:35] fan
[00:55:51] anyways po man quit I think she moved to
[00:55:53] YouTube there was a point in my life
[00:55:55] where I assumed everybody was older than
[00:55:56] me get okay I'm not going to be a are we
[00:55:59] just a react coworkers are probably
[00:56:01] older and if I watch the NFL and I see a
[00:56:03] quarterback on my damn TV he's probably
[00:56:05] older those times have changed Patrick
[00:56:08] Mahomes is literally younger than me and
[00:56:10] I realize it's also changed at my
[00:56:12] current job as a live streamer I'm one
[00:56:14] of the people who have been here longer
[00:56:15] okay I'm not a react
[00:56:23] Andy
[00:56:40] I'm not a react Andy what is FOB up to
[00:56:43] sign to get yapping degree like
[00:56:45] your there's no yapping degree
[00:56:49] bro there's no yapping
[00:56:52] degree wow
[00:57:04] anyways I don't know it's just like this
[00:57:06] stuff is
[00:57:07] like
[00:57:09] yeah yeah it is what it
[00:57:21] is and it's like sometimes there's a lot
[00:57:23] you want to say but it's just not worth
[00:57:24] it cuz it opens a dialogue and it's like
[00:57:25] you have to like keep interacting in the
[00:57:27] dialogue and it's like boom boom boom
[00:57:29] boom and it's just so it it'ss draining
[00:57:31] if it's not your primary content if it's
[00:57:33] your primary content that's what you do
[00:57:34] it is what you do like I make guides but
[00:57:35] it's draining to have to do a lot of
[00:57:37] other stuff too and deal like what up
[00:57:39] slice uh it's drained like to deal with
[00:57:43] like yeah I mean is what it
[00:57:45] is solid
[00:57:49] mental dude ah I might actually Chuck a
[00:57:53] bunch of [ __ ] in the strong box dude I
[00:57:54] did a little bit of Verdi strong box for
[00:57:57] Shun maybe I should do
[00:58:08] more oh wait where is the oh this video
[00:58:11] yes sir Mr Tash if you want to get
[00:58:14] convinced well I don't know what your
[00:58:15] take is I might agree I'm not going to
[00:58:17] preemptively disagree I haven't watched
[00:58:18] the video I'm going to like it after we
[00:58:20] watch it so that you guys don't think I
[00:58:22] don't know what he's going to say I
[00:58:24] don't
[00:58:29] I think I read one comment that was like
[00:58:33] um like I agree with his take for new
[00:58:36] players which because of that I think
[00:58:38] what he said with finina was she's a lot
[00:58:40] better if you have good healers and like
[00:58:42] as a veteran of the game which I kind of
[00:58:44] I do agree with but I also think Fin's
[00:58:45] always good like genuinely
[00:58:48] um yeah uh with Shen Yun I
[00:58:53] genuinely hm
[00:58:56] I re-uploaded my shenyun well I didn't
[00:58:58] reupload like I didn't like ever upload
[00:58:59] and then un upload but like I uploaded
[00:59:01] one like private and then before I publ
[00:59:03] it I I was like H let me add an extra
[00:59:05] minute um I wonder if I could show you
[00:59:07] guys this because I wanted to talk about
[00:59:10] my thoughts on her a bit more so
[00:59:14] like look
[00:59:16] like see uh 30 minutes from 29 so I
[00:59:20] added like I added two minutes at first
[00:59:21] and then I trimmed it um
[00:59:26] yeah um and what I
[00:59:29] added was I was like I was thinking I
[00:59:32] was like okay well how do I truly feel
[00:59:34] about the character so I added up a
[00:59:36] section talking about that is to not
[00:59:38] overhype a character with even with Shia
[00:59:41] who has a really large AOE of damage
[00:59:43] that he can do if you're positioning
[00:59:44] correctly it is important to acknowledge
[00:59:46] certain weaknesses like I I highlighted
[00:59:47] some of I'm like you know with that in
[00:59:50] mind though I'm going to be honest I
[00:59:51] really like this character there are
[00:59:52] many teams where she's really solid I
[00:59:54] was like well okay I skipped some of it
[00:59:56] I was like here are the weaknesses can
[00:59:57] also buff your team and just be
[00:59:58] efficient venty in that regard and so
[01:00:01] even if you don't care too much about
[01:00:03] plunges a downside of hers that I wanted
[01:00:05] to point out is that she won't really
[01:00:06] offer you grouping she's not an anemo
[01:00:08] support like Kaza or venti in that
[01:00:10] regard so there are many teams where you
[01:00:11] may want to just run Kaza with a Healer
[01:00:13] of a different element and sometimes
[01:00:14] plunging can actually disperse enemies
[01:00:16] if they're light and can be knocked
[01:00:18] around while stuff like that and then at
[01:00:19] the end I was like DPS you have
[01:00:21] available can be replaceable but still
[01:00:23] remains a solid option I think she's
[01:00:25] incredibly fun but her value will depend
[01:00:27] on the DPSS you have available and also
[01:00:29] certain supports like finina that will
[01:00:31] give her a lot more value overall
[01:00:32] shenyun is a solid five star that I like
[01:00:34] and I'm happy with but don't feel
[01:00:36] pressured to get her as she's not a
[01:00:37] musle and will vary in strength based on
[01:00:39] who you play her with like that's fair
[01:00:42] not a m pull but I like
[01:00:44] her and I think that's a fair take I
[01:00:47] think
[01:00:50] um here's what I think about shenyun I
[01:00:53] think at worst she's Jean which is not a
[01:00:56] bad spot to be in mat Joy thinks the 18
[01:00:59] months I think at worst she's Jean which
[01:01:01] is not a bad
[01:01:03] spot if you are at
[01:01:06] Jean If you are at Jean like like if you
[01:01:09] are pulling for another Gene a lot of
[01:01:11] times you might not need to might not
[01:01:12] get that much value for it but there's a
[01:01:14] lot of teams where she's significantly
[01:01:16] better A lot of those teams have someone
[01:01:17] like finina or C6 Bennett Oria or duuke
[01:01:21] or Hut especially Hut c0 you get a lot
[01:01:23] of value like there's a lot of teams
[01:01:25] where she genuinely feels like
[01:01:27] gamechanging and there's a lot of teams
[01:01:29] where she just feels like a
[01:01:30] Jee and there's a lot of teams that you
[01:01:33] can make and this is a big thing I
[01:01:36] always
[01:01:38] talk why does care so much about C calls
[01:01:41] a character mid in league if you say you
[01:01:42] made X champ you should get in game no
[01:01:44] one gives a [ __ ] unless it's sarapen
[01:01:47] yeah uh cuz yeah yeah I like to think my
[01:01:52] community doesn't care I joke about like
[01:01:53] CLE and all the time but I've seen a lot
[01:01:56] of people I've seen people get mad at
[01:01:57] Jake like Tano for being like well he
[01:01:59] should talk my comfort character it's
[01:02:00] like like yeah you can like a character
[01:02:02] but I can also be like well [ __ ] that
[01:02:03] character but like you don't have to get
[01:02:04] mad at me I'm not mad at the character
[01:02:06] anyway sorry uh but no disrespect uh but
[01:02:09] anyways
[01:02:12] um uh about shenyun I think there's a
[01:02:16] lot of I'm also a guide maker so I have
[01:02:18] to like give my honest take like if I
[01:02:20] told you YULA is like the best DPS then
[01:02:22] why would you trust me for anything like
[01:02:23] I can't lie for [ __ ] like that like I I
[01:02:26] I saw someone I saw like a one guy on
[01:02:28] Tik Tok be like oh like Zach hated de
[01:02:31] and Candace so I hate him it's like dude
[01:02:32] like I love their design but like like
[01:02:35] what the [ __ ] do you want me to like do
[01:02:36] you want me to say they're broke Candace
[01:02:38] got better with like NE and uh ya ya
[01:02:41] came out after and like like d got
[01:02:43] better like net but like dude like do
[01:02:44] you want me to just be like yeah every
[01:02:45] character is broken like I'm not you
[01:02:47] know I can't do that anyways about
[01:02:49] shenyun I was recording my ging guy but
[01:02:51] then I wanted to stream so I stream so
[01:02:52] it's a bit delayed sorry uh about
[01:02:53] shenyun
[01:02:54] I think here's my personal favorite part
[01:02:57] about her and this is definitely biased
[01:02:59] it is I think she adds an element a new
[01:03:03] gameplay type a brand new team for a lot
[01:03:05] of characters and a new way to play a
[01:03:07] lot of characters in a game that
[01:03:09] notoriously has stale combat like the
[01:03:11] combat system gen is in my opinion
[01:03:13] really good I I've seen people like
[01:03:15] laugh about it I actually think it's a
[01:03:16] really good combat system compared to
[01:03:18] many basically any other oh n that's not
[01:03:21] I haven't played enough to make an
[01:03:22] educated opinion but compared to a lot
[01:03:24] of games I really like the combat system
[01:03:26] there's a lot that genin does wrong but
[01:03:28] I really like the combat system but it's
[01:03:29] notoriously stale because we've been
[01:03:31] playing the same characters for years
[01:03:32] it's always Abyss 12 Abyss 12 Abyss 12
[01:03:34] there's no higher Abyss FL and honestly
[01:03:36] I would rather other endgame content
[01:03:37] than just Abyss Abyss isn't the best
[01:03:39] content in the game I'd rather have
[01:03:40] other [ __ ] to do to each their own I
[01:03:42] always advocate for like endgame Co-op
[01:03:44] stuff raay [ __ ] I could do that'd be
[01:03:45] sick but whatever that's the stuff I
[01:03:47] want and so it's does get
[01:03:51] repetitive however yeah I stole that
[01:03:53] from eon
[01:03:54] however what Shen Yun does is she
[01:03:57] doesn't [ __ ] give you endgame so do
[01:03:59] you need her no but she gives you a new
[01:04:01] way to play a lot of characters duuke
[01:04:03] I've never had this much genuinely I've
[01:04:05] never enjoyed playing duuke this much
[01:04:06] since
[01:04:07] 1.0 basically any character in the game
[01:04:10] you could play with C6 Bennett and
[01:04:11] farzon sorry finina and shenyun and
[01:04:14] clear the abyss and she gives a lot of
[01:04:17] char like even like Hut c0 becomes
[01:04:19] [ __ ] C1 like there's a lot well
[01:04:20] basically there's a lot of [ __ ] you can
[01:04:22] do and it's cool and I like that
[01:04:24] but you don't need her that's my take
[01:04:27] there's a bit more Nuance to it but what
[01:04:28] does an to say you know I initially gave
[01:04:31] my thoughts on cloud miscer and I wasn't
[01:04:35] sold on this character I I felt like she
[01:04:37] just was missing some
[01:04:39] juice I felt like she wasn't that great
[01:04:41] and so don't mention Dory here you're
[01:04:43] not allowed listen you're not listen
[01:04:45] you're not allowed listen I will never
[01:04:47] forgive them for naming my
[01:04:51] uncle my late Uncle Dory they made him
[01:04:55] into a genin character and the genin
[01:04:57] character was what the Abomination we
[01:04:59] now have it is what it
[01:05:04] is my dad is an NPC and sumaru uh my
[01:05:08] brother's middle name is also an NPC
[01:05:10] sumaru um and my I have well I have an
[01:05:15] aunt named Lea I think that's it there
[01:05:17] might be others I don't know every
[01:05:18] sumaru NPC
[01:05:23] but
[01:05:24] what I wanted to do is look at some of
[01:05:26] the other I also a lot of my teachers
[01:05:28] like in like French Classes like not
[01:05:30] like in University but like French
[01:05:32] because I speak French a lot of my
[01:05:33] teachers last names are like infont but
[01:05:37] I don't want to like dox them content
[01:05:38] creators and some of their videos and
[01:05:39] the test that they ran to see if maybe I
[01:05:42] was
[01:05:43] wrong if maybe I was missing something
[01:05:46] and Cloud Smith laner is actually an
[01:05:49] insane
[01:05:51] unit I racked my brain I R some numbers
[01:05:55] and I can
[01:05:56] conclude everyone's
[01:05:59] lying Cloud Mainer is fine you can clear
[01:06:02] some content with her and you can do
[01:06:04] Insane plunging damage but come on let's
[01:06:08] relax a little bit on the lies let's
[01:06:10] relax on the BS let me give it to you
[01:06:13] straight misinformation going out there
[01:06:16] sir well actually the math has been up
[01:06:19] stop stop stop right now look at me I
[01:06:23] actually agree about like I don't know
[01:06:24] what he's about to say but I do think
[01:06:25] that like you have to be in the Middle
[01:06:27] with a character like her cuz I see a
[01:06:28] lot of people kind of Doom posting her I
[01:06:29] see a lot of people super duper hyping
[01:06:31] her I think she's pretty much in the
[01:06:32] middle but like on the good like the
[01:06:36] mileage may vary she could be really
[01:06:37] good for you or just Gan for you but Gan
[01:06:38] is not a bad place to be so I don't
[01:06:40] think she's bad like I don't think
[01:06:42] there's a situation where she's if
[01:06:45] anything like more than slightly worse
[01:06:47] than Jean a was done on CLE who's
[01:06:50] playing CLE how many of you are playing
[01:06:53] CLE exactly so stop it the math was done
[01:06:56] on so many units but there's there's
[01:06:59] just something oh she does have high
[01:07:01] requirements that is a downside that I
[01:07:02] need to start this off before everyone
[01:07:04] rages
[01:07:06] listen it's just a character true it's
[01:07:09] just a character character speak your
[01:07:11] Tru to believe me go watch gotcha gamer
[01:07:14] go watch the Jeff I don't care who you
[01:07:16] pick go watch your people enjoy your
[01:07:19] enjoy your character thing yo you can't
[01:07:22] look shout out to Jeff but you can't say
[01:07:23] go on Jeff when it's like if you don't
[01:07:26] like me being critical of a character
[01:07:27] he's literally like he literally will
[01:07:29] like start talking about the negative of
[01:07:31] a character first he'll be
[01:07:33] like he'll be like dude we talking about
[01:07:36] Navia I think he liked Navia by the way
[01:07:38] but he started with like do you know
[01:07:40] what I hate about Navia I'm like yo what
[01:07:41] if we started about the positive have
[01:07:44] some fun turn me off if you like the
[01:07:47] character you want to play it let's
[01:07:49] start with some pros and cons first okay
[01:07:52] looks really cool all right little
[01:07:55] Bayonetta Vibe that's great other thing
[01:07:57] is she can enable some kind of goofy
[01:08:01] stuff if you go to Z Jeff's Twitter
[01:08:03] right now he doesn't trigger C whoa whoa
[01:08:05] whoa yeah I agree like I think he says I
[01:08:07] think he just says what he believes like
[01:08:09] I don't think he like you know and I
[01:08:11] respect that I respect that can enable I
[01:08:15] think sometimes he'll like hype up
[01:08:16] things that are like that shouldn't work
[01:08:19] but work like he'll be like yo play TF
[01:08:21] any new character yo yo DPS Bennett is
[01:08:24] better than your M [ __ ] you by the way
[01:08:26] anyways it might be true but [ __ ] you
[01:08:28] kind of goofy stuff if you go to Z
[01:08:30] Jeff's Twitter right now okay let's go
[01:08:33] to I think this is a great Showcase of
[01:08:35] this all right my guy jumps in yep and
[01:08:40] Pops off oh whoa the video where'd it go
[01:08:43] pops off yep now granted using Bennett
[01:08:48] C6 which is kind of a requirement for
[01:08:50] this using cloud clanger and using
[01:08:53] furina
[01:08:54] but using iato here I do think everyone
[01:08:56] should well okay that's a bad take for a
[01:08:58] Goa game but most people should go for
[01:09:01] finina unless you already have like
[01:09:02] literally every Hydra character but
[01:09:03] essentially just do these crazy plunging
[01:09:05] Vape attacks um because he's got man I
[01:09:09] wish this wasn't gacha I wish I could
[01:09:11] say if you don't have like I wish I
[01:09:13] could say if you don't have finina just
[01:09:14] get finina but I can't cuz it's a gacha
[01:09:16] game but I wish it wasn't I wish I could
[01:09:18] say skill issue if you don't have a
[01:09:19] character I wish man I wish and benett
[01:09:22] is now allowing him to do fire but you
[01:09:23] do this with many different combos but
[01:09:26] it does allow you to hit quite hard all
[01:09:29] right and clear content sweet a new play
[01:09:32] style has been unlocked nice big chunky
[01:09:35] hits but I'm going to tell you this
[01:09:37] right now I can clear this same boss
[01:09:41] with Shang Ling and Shing
[01:09:42] [Music]
[01:09:45] Cho this this isn't like this this crazy
[01:09:48] thing Cloud disclaimer is not making
[01:09:51] this like insane oh my God busted thing
[01:09:54] she's opening up a door all right and
[01:09:57] another great example of that is there's
[01:09:59] videos going around all right I'll show
[01:10:02] you here um I win to lose my gamer shows
[01:10:06] off a great example of this yeah my
[01:10:08] video wasn't uploaded at this time what
[01:10:09] the kit does you can go in here if you
[01:10:10] want to check this out you can see
[01:10:14] Yo never mind shinen going in and
[01:10:16] buffing uh you know the dragon oh my God
[01:10:20] not the the n1j no that's probably fine
[01:10:23] though I didn't watch it are some
[01:10:24] interesting characters like our boy sh
[01:10:27] find Spotlight dude OA has like no not
[01:10:30] OA what's the guy called Primo V has my
[01:10:32] goat what do you think about this dude
[01:10:34] ZF watched this and he was like te W
[01:10:37] every e was a waste of DPS look look
[01:10:39] 300K plunges my e is like one damage
[01:10:41] dude I actually I think what we're going
[01:10:43] to try to do either this stream or next
[01:10:45] is we're going to try to one rotate the
[01:10:46] too with the Luke I think I can but we
[01:10:48] need to not go Crimson witch cuz on
[01:10:49] Crimson witch you need to press your e
[01:10:50] we're going to go like Mar or something
[01:10:52] and just not press e it's such a waste
[01:10:54] of time to
[01:10:57] eat but it's also bonus damage so I
[01:10:59] don't know guys welcome to hey what's up
[01:11:02] hey who can have some pretty crazy
[01:11:05] results all right hundreds of thousands
[01:11:07] of damage for sure for sure if you start
[01:11:10] looking at duuk and you look at his
[01:11:12] normal attack look at this plunging
[01:11:14] damage this thing is crazy all right
[01:11:16] 400% and then you're buffing it up you
[01:11:18] missed your bet at at 437 in your guide
[01:11:22] I got to stop giving people this
[01:11:23] attention cuz listen there's no way I'm
[01:11:26] addressing
[01:11:27] this no oh wait wait wait this was for
[01:11:30] energy but dude [ __ ] that enemy though
[01:11:33] why does he take so long to wake up just
[01:11:36] that's not my fault not my fault more
[01:11:38] you're getting extra crit rate I get it
[01:11:41] Cloud
[01:11:43] Mamer is cool because Mis maybe she's
[01:11:47] bringing some character oh retainer I
[01:11:48] get it lawyer by the way is she better
[01:11:51] than the arena
[01:11:54] or not this bull cuted idiot Ryden
[01:11:59] whoa or not this
[01:12:03] bu that was funny though it's not toxic
[01:12:06] if it's funny or kazua or I I I mean
[01:12:10] there's a it's right there she's on the
[01:12:13] other Banner she's right there is oh
[01:12:15] yeah n's way better but
[01:12:17] like that doesn't make cler bad like
[01:12:19] there's some teams well like if you're
[01:12:20] playing Shia I don't want Nikita if
[01:12:22] you're playing duuke or
[01:12:24] um Hut
[01:12:27] or any character with Bennett well
[01:12:30] Bennett finina can run Nita I think Nita
[01:12:32] is one of the most broken characters in
[01:12:33] the game Nita is either number one or
[01:12:34] number two pull I'm not really decided
[01:12:37] between Nita and Kazo I would argue Nita
[01:12:38] if you're playing a dender team but a
[01:12:39] lot of people don't like need to play
[01:12:41] dendro teams but if you do I think Nita
[01:12:43] but
[01:12:44] anyways um so yeah like obviously I
[01:12:47] think this characters that are higher in
[01:12:47] po value but anyways let's keep let them
[01:12:49] talk is she better than Nita she does
[01:12:51] something different I get it I know I
[01:12:52] know I know yeah I said I wasn't sure
[01:12:54] but the more I think about it I think
[01:12:55] the is definitely a number one Kazo
[01:12:57] gives you like convenience and [ __ ] with
[01:12:58] a lot of people like are always joining
[01:13:00] who maybe aren't knowledgeable I can't
[01:13:02] make a video and hype her up I can't
[01:13:04] make a video and be like oh my God this
[01:13:07] character is crazy because at at best
[01:13:11] she's a niche upgrade for one team and
[01:13:14] she's a side upgrade for a couple more
[01:13:17] at best and a downgrade in others I I
[01:13:20] just
[01:13:21] cannot in my right mind
[01:13:23] tell people to get this character unless
[01:13:25] they just want to M around and have some
[01:13:26] fun if you do do your thing so I I have
[01:13:28] to start the video with that but
[01:13:30] honestly I think she is just kind of
[01:13:33] trash a Primo Jam is I'm
[01:13:38] Ted remember that idea you said yo we
[01:13:40] should call to convince
[01:13:42] me
[01:13:49] brother a Primo gem is a Primo gem she
[01:13:52] can heal but not as good as Jean she's
[01:13:55] different healer it's pretty similar to
[01:13:57] Jean but it's sustained okay is she
[01:13:59] better healer than kakomi no is she a
[01:14:01] better hero than Bennett no can she be
[01:14:04] with Bennett
[01:14:05] sure can she boost your damage for
[01:14:08] plunging yes can she give some cool crit
[01:14:10] rate
[01:14:12] sure can she Shred the enemies with ver
[01:14:15] descent set yes can she also give you a
[01:14:17] supportive weapon like thr Tails yes can
[01:14:19] she also enable a new play style for
[01:14:20] characters like punen yes okay now we
[01:14:22] found her Niche or wait could we also
[01:14:25] just use kazua to buff our Elemental
[01:14:28] damage and shred them as well or let's
[01:14:31] just scoop on back here could we use
[01:14:33] sucrose to also do the same goddamn
[01:14:36] thing and boost up our em like crazy and
[01:14:38] hit even harder um I I just okay off the
[01:14:42] Record take I'm not streaming right now
[01:14:44] so no one can hear this or clip this
[01:14:45] sucros was better than like half of the
[01:14:47] five stars limited Banner five stars you
[01:14:48] named earlier but we're not ready for
[01:14:50] this discussion however with that in
[01:14:51] mind with that out of the way uh I think
[01:14:54] that a lot of the times well first of
[01:14:56] all Shen Is A two-in-one Healer kazwa
[01:14:58] and sucros aren't is kazwa like a better
[01:15:00] unit in my opinion yes I think he is
[01:15:02] same with sucros but I still think she
[01:15:04] gets there are some teams where she is
[01:15:06] literally the best option there's a lot
[01:15:07] of teams where she's just a gene and I
[01:15:10] don't think Gina is bad but there's a
[01:15:12] lot of teams where she's also
[01:15:13] significantly better not that many
[01:15:14] there's like probably four or five which
[01:15:17] is good and in those teams I think you
[01:15:19] have a good reason to PFF her however
[01:15:21] outside of that there's also the sphere
[01:15:23] of gives you a completely new play style
[01:15:26] for basically any character that can
[01:15:29] either Infuse their attacks or is a
[01:15:31] catalist or can have C6 Ben
[01:15:33] it can she boost your damage for
[01:15:36] plunging yeah and you don't need circles
[01:15:37] anymore she gives him cool crit rate
[01:15:39] sure but I don't really care about that
[01:15:40] too much can she Shred the enemies with
[01:15:42] ver descent set yes she can't okay now
[01:15:46] we found her Niche or wait could we also
[01:15:49] just use kazua to buff our Elemental
[01:15:52] damage and Shred the as well or let's
[01:15:55] just scoop on back here could we use
[01:15:57] sucrose to also do the same goddamn
[01:15:59] thing and boost up our em like crazy and
[01:16:02] hit even harder um I I just feel like
[01:16:05] it's this this thing where erectile
[01:16:08] dysfunction is true she's fine she's
[01:16:11] cool but I life can get hard can you not
[01:16:15] being
[01:16:16] fair I'm not going to say she's trash
[01:16:19] but I don't think she's like this God
[01:16:21] tier unit and people in chat are just
[01:16:23] like you're wrong she is amazing and
[01:16:26] that's fine but my question is and then
[01:16:28] I'll move on my question is is it
[01:16:30] because of math like this so gotcha
[01:16:33] gamer I have to call you out on this I
[01:16:35] have to call you out on this bro is
[01:16:37] playing Chong you shl with
[01:16:44] nope no disrespect all right he's
[01:16:46] talking the plunging damage is good for
[01:16:48] sure for sure okay he's doing normal
[01:16:50] plunges 52,000 damage yo I deleted that
[01:16:53] on my video I I'm going to open my
[01:16:55] editing software I might leak something
[01:16:57] I don't care actually I don't know
[01:16:58] what's in here one second there might be
[01:16:59] a z caul let me be
[01:17:03] careful
[01:17:05] um Shen
[01:17:10] Yun what if I spam control
[01:17:17] Z I'm spamming control Z one sec chat I
[01:17:20] want see if I can find
[01:17:22] it
[01:17:23] [Music]
[01:17:26] um and yes she's many dispers enemies
[01:17:31] get your energy
[01:17:33] so oh is here it's
[01:17:38] here is the difference between low and
[01:17:40] high plunges dude I have to change my
[01:17:42] footage so many times cuz there's like
[01:17:43] two numbers instead of one yeah anyways
[01:17:47] plunge one that will give you a second
[01:17:48] hit of plunge important and advanced
[01:17:50] tips that I
[01:17:52] want Collision plunge this is the
[01:17:56] additional on top hit of plunge damage
[01:18:00] on every single plunge when you run into
[01:18:01] an enemy the hit box of this you will
[01:18:04] get two num basically as when you do it
[01:18:06] anywhere I plunge plunge attack
[01:18:08] animation and then it uh kind of anyways
[01:18:12] I had a side by side of my sh's plunge
[01:18:13] damage with and without her and I edited
[01:18:15] it out that was my only thing I wanted
[01:18:16] to say that's all with Cloud
[01:18:20] mcleer 90,000 right cuz like here's
[01:18:23] another thing the damage buff gets
[01:18:25] significantly more if you're like doing
[01:18:26] specific things like vaporizing because
[01:18:28] her buff is like a quill it gets added
[01:18:30] to your deluke attack and then
[01:18:31] multiplied by crit damage it gets Vaped
[01:18:34] it gets melted it doesn't get quickened
[01:18:35] but it gets Vaped or melted so it's it
[01:18:38] could be a lot bigger than it seems
[01:18:40] which is why I didn't feel comfortable I
[01:18:41] don't want to show the Shia cuz yeah it
[01:18:42] matters for Shia but you can get even
[01:18:44] more of a buff if you're vaping it Shia
[01:18:46] can't Vape 7 74% damage buff hitting
[01:18:49] harder for sure I don't expect most
[01:18:51] people to know that then here the issue
[01:18:53] here's the issue with the video is my
[01:18:55] guy makes one fatal flaw and this is
[01:18:58] where you got to check things and this
[01:19:00] is where you have to consider things is
[01:19:03] he starts saying okay well now check
[01:19:05] this out the normal duuke is hitting
[01:19:09] 52,000 damage yeah well Cloud retainer
[01:19:13] is making it 100 yeah this is why I hate
[01:19:15] this [ __ ] and why I I want to do it
[01:19:17] people ask me like yo how much damage
[01:19:19] like it's like I want to do it but it's
[01:19:20] like there's no vescent vener here there
[01:19:22] might be thrilling Tails it might be a
[01:19:23] signature weapon it could get Vaped like
[01:19:25] there's a lot like the percentage
[01:19:27] increase is really difficult to 47,000
[01:19:30] damage show because he's vaping he's
[01:19:33] vaping his like I saw this is like 1.0
[01:19:35] lower I saw razor M's fight about like
[01:19:37] Skyward Pride being best slot versus
[01:19:39] like some other [ __ ] weapon and then
[01:19:41] one of the two showcases had like didn't
[01:19:43] crit a single time and their other one
[01:19:44] was like critting every hit it here what
[01:19:47] it is he's not getting a vape on the
[01:19:48] other side so if you start throwing the
[01:19:51] Vape on the other side it is a lot lot
[01:19:53] closer here and then start question all
[01:19:56] these different things it's like okay
[01:19:57] well if you're flying in the air like a
[01:19:59] like a bird right I'm just I'm flying
[01:20:01] through the air I'm slamming down I
[01:20:03] understand big number good but am I
[01:20:06] taking time away from my shingo doing
[01:20:10] damage or my yalon doing damage or my
[01:20:12] Kaza doing damage or my other things
[01:20:15] going on right absolutely I understand
[01:20:18] that cloud retainer kind of I mean can
[01:20:22] boost up and cause this but you also
[01:20:25] have to remember that
[01:20:27] kazua is also at the same time if he was
[01:20:31] in your team going like this yeah yeah
[01:20:33] yeah and he's got a tornado and he's
[01:20:35] going like this and it's it's hitting
[01:20:37] him and it's debuffing them over and
[01:20:39] over and he doing all these other things
[01:20:42] and and it's like they just gloss over
[01:20:44] that I dude I I I the thing I like with
[01:20:47] OS is like I rarely agree with his genin
[01:20:50] takes but I I I still love him cuz like
[01:20:53] his heart's in the right place I hate it
[01:20:55] because they look at the big number they
[01:20:57] see this and they're like 186% more
[01:20:59] damage [ __ ] look at the [ __ ] number
[01:21:02] and it's like I understand that but the
[01:21:05] 10,000 damage hitting all area of effect
[01:21:09] multiple units are getting tagged adds
[01:21:11] up to a lot of damage and with a lot of
[01:21:14] floors with a lot of people can disagree
[01:21:16] so love each other no cuz we're never
[01:21:18] going to get changed cuz a [ __ ] like
[01:21:19] you cuz a [ __ ] like you we're never
[01:21:22] getting sorry let's keep watching there
[01:21:23] are situations where she's not looking
[01:21:25] as good okay single Target maybe but I
[01:21:29] just don't think that this stuff is fair
[01:21:31] and I think that in Z Jeff's video I
[01:21:34] gota I gotta find it I don't know
[01:21:36] there's so much pre-release whoa who
[01:21:40] she's out now it's fine I feel like kind
[01:21:41] of proves the fact here as well
[01:21:43] somewhere with d where he does like a
[01:21:46] 50,000 damage hit and it's cool and all
[01:21:50] but then but then he follows up right
[01:21:53] after I think it's right here
[01:21:56] okay he follows up right after and he
[01:22:00] does like a normal version and it's like
[01:22:02] 42,000 damage 100,000 damage 42 and and
[01:22:05] so it's like damage per screenshot good
[01:22:08] but also regular duuk uh whenever he
[01:22:11] ends up doing it is still hitting like a
[01:22:14] truck as well yes but if you play Dragon
[01:22:17] strike deluke without sh shenu shenyun
[01:22:20] why did I forget her name shenyun you
[01:22:22] need help like I don't mean this as like
[01:22:25] a derogatory way I mean it like that is
[01:22:28] ass to play like it's actually ass to
[01:22:31] get like shanglin levels of damage I'm
[01:22:33] sorry if you do it good for you no
[01:22:35] disrespect shout out to luk mans but it
[01:22:38] is so tragic to like okay di on a shield
[01:22:41] then you're like Dash jump as you dash
[01:22:43] plunge you have to get the pl I'm sorry
[01:22:45] I hate it if you like it that when you
[01:22:47] start taking into account well now I
[01:22:49] could use someone like yalon or shincho
[01:22:52] to to be attacking while doing my normal
[01:22:55] attacks I don't know obviously if you're
[01:22:58] using Cloud retainer you wouldn't use
[01:23:00] yalon or shincho maybe you want to use
[01:23:03] someone else
[01:23:04] shingo but is the math of Chad read my
[01:23:09] pronunciation sing
[01:23:13] to actually 10 out of
[01:23:16] 10 better than normal duuke but also
[01:23:21] crazy shingo who [ __ ] hits one e my
[01:23:25] shingo on an e can do 100,000 D is this
[01:23:28] the guy from YouTube not the wrong guy
[01:23:30] so it's like yeah he like for sure du
[01:23:33] good but now no I'm not the guy from
[01:23:35] YouTube [ __ ] the guy from YouTube he
[01:23:36] made a guide on a character after he
[01:23:38] sorry I'll shut up other insane DPS unit
[01:23:41] out of the mix and again I know that
[01:23:44] they might have different teams I I get
[01:23:45] it I people are going to be like well
[01:23:47] actually you wouldn't use them together
[01:23:48] I know you're going to do that to me but
[01:23:51] um
[01:23:54] I just I just feel like she might
[01:23:57] be yo
[01:24:00] yo
[01:24:03] what lightly better and if the math
[01:24:06] fully says and people want to test it it
[01:24:09] says she's better do your thing but at
[01:24:12] the end of the
[01:24:13] day you also have to like plunging and I
[01:24:17] find plunging so uh
[01:24:21] uninteresting now that being said I also
[01:24:23] use aato I'm going to be honest I was
[01:24:25] actually afraid to break my like booting
[01:24:28] I have a keyboard for like valerant I
[01:24:30] literally was considering swapping it
[01:24:32] because playing Dragon strike deluke you
[01:24:34] literally have to like you dash cancel
[01:24:36] but you have to like plunge as soon as
[01:24:38] you dash you literally Dash you
[01:24:40] literally like mash your [ __ ]
[01:24:41] keyboard it's like it's not fun well
[01:24:43] it's not not fun but it's like I worry
[01:24:45] about my like that
[01:24:46] is is the most boring character in the
[01:24:48] game because he just goes shing shing
[01:24:50] shing shing and he just does the same
[01:24:52] animation 50 times I get it uh not
[01:24:55] Everyone likes the same characters and I
[01:24:57] like duuke I like using e attack e
[01:25:01] attack I like the feeling of it and so
[01:25:04] essentially becoming budget Shia for me
[01:25:07] not fun there reason if you go over here
[01:25:10] and you look into arive is Shia on my
[01:25:16] team he's had five chances and I said no
[01:25:20] every also his historically speaking not
[01:25:23] to be a historian but I you know I have
[01:25:26] had my fair share of educational classes
[01:25:30] historically the one thing that has
[01:25:31] United Nations right there's one we
[01:25:33] learned in anthropology class there's
[01:25:34] one universal taboo a lot of things in
[01:25:36] different cultures are not taboo there's
[01:25:39] one thing that is across every culture
[01:25:41] I'm pretty sure not I don't know why I'm
[01:25:42] bringing this up but I'm pretty sure it
[01:25:43] was incest by the way which is the
[01:25:44] universal taboo you learn something new
[01:25:46] every day anthropology is cool my friend
[01:25:47] Rick is now studying to be an
[01:25:48] anthropologist is that a thing I don't
[01:25:50] know but he took from that class it
[01:25:51] actually a cool class but any anyways uh
[01:25:53] and one thing that is uniting all
[01:25:55] nations everyone agrees upon is BBA and
[01:25:59] shenyun is something that we can all
[01:26:00] agree upon now obviously you know don't
[01:26:03] just pull for that pull if you want to
[01:26:04] don't pull if you want to play the
[01:26:06] characters you like but just acknowledge
[01:26:07] that that is something that people
[01:26:09] usually tend to agree upon G on my
[01:26:14] team he's had five chances and I said no
[01:26:18] every single time so I don't know I I I
[01:26:23] just
[01:26:24] uh as someone
[01:26:26] who uh is
[01:26:28] dumb as someone
[01:26:33] who makes terrible content well I
[01:26:35] thought this was ending there's 10 more
[01:26:37] minutes I have a hard time recommending
[01:26:38] her because I don't know where your
[01:26:41] account is I don't know at what stage
[01:26:43] you're at and unless you've got some of
[01:26:45] the core core units um it's hard for me
[01:26:49] to get excited and the final thing yes
[01:26:53] is pretty good for if you're vaping not
[01:26:56] bad can she be more valuable than hyper
[01:27:01] Bloom wait
[01:27:03] what yo yo is she more valuable than
[01:27:06] nalette who's power corrupt like every
[01:27:09] DPS unit in the
[01:27:10] game probably not probably not so
[01:27:13] depending on your on your polls
[01:27:15] depending on your economy depending on
[01:27:17] that wallet you've got going on um I
[01:27:20] think get on your account it's
[01:27:24] [Music]
[01:27:27] it's a little more complicated in my
[01:27:28] opinion because at worst she's Gene and
[01:27:30] you can't really say jee's bad for a new
[01:27:31] player but I agree there's a lot of new
[01:27:33] charact there's a lot of characters that
[01:27:34] I think I rank higher in a pull value
[01:27:36] list Nikita I I'm actually making a
[01:27:38] video on pull value characters I already
[01:27:40] made it but I need to update it now but
[01:27:42] anyways right there's a lot of
[01:27:43] characters that are more valuable but
[01:27:45] also this Banner like let's say you're
[01:27:46] like a new sh player I do recommend this
[01:27:48] Banner let's say you like gaming a lot
[01:27:50] you might get one for free from the
[01:27:51] lantern right but his cons are good you
[01:27:53] get a cloud retainer for him um although
[01:27:56] if you don't care about farizon or Noel
[01:27:58] maybe be careful
[01:28:00] but skip for me better for new players
[01:28:02] oh not even close n's yeah n's yeah yeah
[01:28:05] always I's broken I will not
[01:28:08] recommender but I will not deny and so
[01:28:13] clip this before you spread
[01:28:15] misinformation clip this sir I will not
[01:28:18] deny that she opens up some doors and
[01:28:20] she opens up some comps and there's a
[01:28:21] couple sit sitations where it actually
[01:28:23] may be a DPS increase at the cost of
[01:28:26] potentially making the play style more
[01:28:28] clunky and more boring and less face
[01:28:31] roll and so if the genin community
[01:28:35] that's fair is is so casual that that
[01:28:38] word gets thrown around we don't want to
[01:28:40] get stressed during the
[01:28:42] abyss I have a question for you do you
[01:28:44] want to play like this okay [ __ ] plunge
[01:28:47] and we got to do
[01:28:49] a noral attack in between plunging it
[01:28:52] attack and normal attack we got to do a
[01:28:53] charge Camp kids that's actually true
[01:28:56] though that's actually how I played the
[01:28:57] Luke with this team look look look look
[01:28:59] at this [ __ ] if you could hear my
[01:29:00] keyboard inputs during
[01:29:04] this wait wait wait wait until I start
[01:29:06] plunging look at the dash cancels
[01:29:13] wait it's a fair point tashad it's a
[01:29:15] fair point it's a fair point or do you
[01:29:18] want to go but it is a brand new play
[01:29:20] style which is cool I do think it's more
[01:29:23] for veteran characters than new
[01:29:29] players yeah look at this I [ __ ] C
[01:29:33] all the content in the Day game doing
[01:29:35] this hell yeah baby yeah baby I cleared
[01:29:39] it all or or do you want to do you want
[01:29:42] to equip uh a little but like for
[01:29:45] example like it turns your like your Hut
[01:29:47] can now jump cancel at c0 and you feel
[01:29:50] like it's not like you're going to feel
[01:29:52] like oh [ __ ] I need see1 whereas I
[01:29:54] genuinely think if you're just
[01:29:56] like shobu and go yeah I'm just standing
[01:30:00] here and everything's dying with Hyper
[01:30:02] Bloom you know what I'm saying like are
[01:30:06] the people that are playing this new
[01:30:07] unit casual don't care about jump cancel
[01:30:09] okay but it doesn't matter how casual
[01:30:10] you are let's say you're like let's say
[01:30:12] you're like like if you're like turbo
[01:30:14] casual and you don't look up how to
[01:30:15] build a team that's fair but like if
[01:30:17] you're like at least a little bit
[01:30:18] playing something and you decide okay
[01:30:21] well I'm going to do a Hut team just do
[01:30:22] whatever I want and then you happen to
[01:30:25] jump you're like okay well I'll play UT
[01:30:27] team with shenyun cuz I like her and
[01:30:29] then you happen to jump at any point in
[01:30:31] your
[01:30:32] rotation and then you're like okay I'll
[01:30:34] plunge and okay this isn't going to vape
[01:30:36] but well huh my plunge is at 200k or
[01:30:39] however it does more than your charge
[01:30:41] attacks like it feels rewarding when my
[01:30:43] huta burst does as or sorry my Hut
[01:30:45] plunge does like as much as my burst
[01:30:46] almost like I enjoy that a lot 777
[01:30:51] really
[01:30:52] really no it was s so
[01:30:58] sad plunges are they are they this
[01:31:01] sweaty like I'm literally glistening I'm
[01:31:04] glistening because I'm I'm talking about
[01:31:06] this so much um is it worth it is it
[01:31:09] worth it for you maybe not if you're on
[01:31:12] your mobile it might not be worth it
[01:31:13] maybe too many button prizes I don't
[01:31:15] know but I don't know I just have a hard
[01:31:18] time hard time with with
[01:31:23] people man's unraveling
[01:31:27] [Music]
[01:31:32] unravel plung value they do the math and
[01:31:35] they go
[01:31:36] crazy you think it takes away
[01:31:38] character's identity honestly no because
[01:31:41] you just don't need to use her if you
[01:31:42] don't want to like at worst she could be
[01:31:44] a gene in that team and you don't have
[01:31:45] like you don't have to force her like
[01:31:48] she either enable like how do I say this
[01:31:50] let's say you're like man I really want
[01:31:52] to [ __ ] play yunin DPS I love yunen
[01:31:54] yunen is my idol I want to play yunen
[01:31:56] DPS now you can and you can clear the
[01:31:59] abyss with it but she's a pyrro pogo
[01:32:00] stick do you want to make her a pyrro
[01:32:02] poo stick maybe not but if you do you
[01:32:04] can and if you don't then don't play
[01:32:05] them together it's fine you
[01:32:08] know first time chatter cringe true his
[01:32:12] premises wrong casuals don't care about
[01:32:13] Abyss well
[01:32:15] yeah yes like I also assume like really
[01:32:17] casual players don't watch me and don't
[01:32:19] watch like my videos that doesn't mean I
[01:32:21] don't cater like I still try to make
[01:32:23] videos for everyone obviously when I
[01:32:24] make a guide I try to do that but I also
[01:32:26] acknowledge that like what we assume is
[01:32:29] like default Baseline information 90% or
[01:32:33] I don't know like 80 90 99% of genin
[01:32:35] players don't give a [ __ ]
[01:32:37] about right and uh and they don't factor
[01:32:40] in maybe the ease of use or the the
[01:32:43] other options or or what does she enable
[01:32:46] because there's no reason to like why
[01:32:48] the [ __ ] would I let's say I clear Abyss
[01:32:51] 11 why would I try to get Nine Stars on
[01:32:53] the abyss on 12 uh three or 12 fl 12 for
[01:32:57] like 150 Primos why would I go from six
[01:33:00] stars to Nine Stars for an extra 50
[01:33:03] Primos which would take me probably
[01:33:04] months of grinding like to go from six
[01:33:06] star to Nine Star especially if I'm not
[01:33:08] like a like if I'm just super casual and
[01:33:10] like I'm not like sweating to get like
[01:33:12] the perfect like you know like okay I
[01:33:14] need minimal investment Hyper Team Shang
[01:33:15] Ling team like this that it's like you
[01:33:17] know it's it's I enjoy that I do I wish
[01:33:20] that like I had to [ __ ] play
[01:33:22] perfectly to clear the abyss I enjoy
[01:33:25] that but I know most people don't
[01:33:27] especially if the reward is 50 Primos if
[01:33:29] the reward was like a [ __ ] like tenple
[01:33:31] that's not even that much considering
[01:33:33] it's the hardest content in the game but
[01:33:34] even if it was like a tenpole a lot more
[01:33:36] people would be like okay you know maybe
[01:33:38] this meta thing you know maybe maybe
[01:33:39] sing tro is pretty good maybe you know
[01:33:41] what maybe maybe I'll play Sing
[01:33:43] tro I don't know I I I just feel like
[01:33:48] every godamn I want a different game
[01:33:50] mode that to too obviously rewards POG I
[01:33:54] rewards do like because 50 Primos is
[01:33:56] [ __ ] 50 Primos like it's not worth it
[01:33:59] but it is sad but also I I think there's
[01:34:02] so much genin's combat system being
[01:34:05] reduced to Abyss is a is a disgrace to
[01:34:08] genin's combat system because genin's
[01:34:09] combat system in my opinion this is like
[01:34:11] as a Jeff take I think but it's
[01:34:12] literally better it's too good for the
[01:34:14] game like it's in there's like so much
[01:34:17] you could do with it that you can't
[01:34:18] really it's like okay well I can clear
[01:34:20] the PMA faster than you haha it's like
[01:34:23] there's so much more I can do is like
[01:34:25] well she which is good I love it that's
[01:34:27] why I love this game okay but like give
[01:34:29] me something sorry hot and that's fine
[01:34:32] but even if she is hot or she isn't hot
[01:34:35] Boss Rush true every character that
[01:34:37] comes out is god tier is amazing is
[01:34:41] gamechanging she opened up door she's
[01:34:44] fine yo h on gen new raid came out where
[01:34:47] do we draw the line yo where are we
[01:34:48] dropping boys came out it was apparent
[01:34:52] it was mathematically proven it was so
[01:34:54] easy to use in so many ways he's
[01:34:57] busted I can understand wait what
[01:35:00] happened I missed something why are
[01:35:00] people aling what you say what does she
[01:35:02] enable um other than like duuke I don't
[01:35:06] know I I I just feel like every goddamn
[01:35:10] character comes out is like well she's
[01:35:12] hot and that's fine but even if she is
[01:35:16] hot or she isn't hot if that's just go
[01:35:19] the game no like this is fine you're
[01:35:20] allowed to not like character is to be
[01:35:21] honest about it like I there's no
[01:35:23] problem with a video like this it's fine
[01:35:24] like say your opinion I don't think like
[01:35:26] it's fine not not everyone else be like
[01:35:27] oh my God new character woo like you
[01:35:29] know you're L to not like a character
[01:35:31] I'm going to disagree with some of the
[01:35:32] takes if I don't think they're
[01:35:34] like correct if that's the word I mean
[01:35:37] it's an opinion but like you know God
[01:35:40] tier is amazing is changing she opens up
[01:35:44] a door she's fine but like come on where
[01:35:47] do we draw the line when nlet came out
[01:35:52] it was apparent it was mathematically
[01:35:54] proven it was so easy to use in so many
[01:35:56] ways he's busted dude you know why the
[01:35:59] only reason I remember this the only
[01:36:02] reason I purposefully didn't call Net
[01:36:04] broken was cuz someone in my chat I got
[01:36:06] one guide I had just made a finina video
[01:36:09] and she's oh no wait oh yeah I just made
[01:36:11] a FAL video and someone and I think
[01:36:13] fishal is broken by the way for a
[01:36:14] fourstar especially with constellations
[01:36:16] I genuinely believe it someone in my
[01:36:17] chat was like dude you called everyone
[01:36:19] broken so I like okay fine and then I
[01:36:20] called them insane Cory donated one same
[01:36:23] thing well kind of perfect rotation and
[01:36:26] builds to clear Abyss would be amazing
[01:36:28] because people would finally realize how
[01:36:30] much better yay shut the [ __ ] Y is great
[01:36:33] Y is great I like y she's really good a
[01:36:35] lot of Y seems use ficial too though so
[01:36:37] you
[01:36:39] know there's no beef between them I can
[01:36:41] understand hyping Up N I can understand
[01:36:44] hyping up Nita I can understand idiots
[01:36:47] like me not realizing how good Kaza is
[01:36:52] but yeah like I know this isn't really
[01:36:55] referenced to me because like my video
[01:36:57] wasn't out I was talking about like
[01:36:58] other CES but as far as I go I try to
[01:37:00] like obviously I make a guide for
[01:37:01] everyone and then based on how good the
[01:37:03] character is I will Express that in an
[01:37:06] honest manner but I'm still going to
[01:37:07] make a guide even if the character is
[01:37:08] bad right like if a character is bad I'm
[01:37:10] not going to call them amazing like I
[01:37:12] don't think rli's bad but I don't think
[01:37:13] he's amazing so I was like okay
[01:37:14] strongest rly build right I think dory's
[01:37:16] bad I think Deo is bad but I still made
[01:37:18] guides for them but then for characters
[01:37:19] I think are broken I'm going to say
[01:37:20] they're broken I'm okay this character's
[01:37:24] broken everyone else realizing how good
[01:37:26] he is and everyone getting super excited
[01:37:29] and being like Oh my God this is a mus
[01:37:30] pole unit but it feels like every
[01:37:32] character that comes out is like oh
[01:37:33] they're a mus pole this one Niche thing
[01:37:35] is a mus it's not it just isn't and uh
[01:37:38] and and so I want to give you my opinion
[01:37:41] because it is different than the other
[01:37:43] people and I don't have to be right I
[01:37:47] don't have to be right on such as a mus
[01:37:50] yeah I don't think think so there might
[01:37:51] have been some clickbait I said I mean
[01:37:54] we know what I said I already went over
[01:37:55] it I said the following but my video
[01:37:57] wasn't out when he made his I said this
[01:37:59] Arena that will give her a lot more
[01:38:00] value overall shenyun is a solid five
[01:38:02] star that I like and I'm happy with but
[01:38:04] don't feel pressured to get her as she's
[01:38:06] not a mustle and will vary in right I
[01:38:09] said some other things too but I at
[01:38:11] least want to give you my argument that
[01:38:14] I think that she's overrated I think I
[01:38:17] think is there a team where DMC is a bit
[01:38:18] better compared to Nita oh
[01:38:21] I'm sorry you lost your 50/50 DMC is a
[01:38:24] fine option uh have
[01:38:27] fun um you know it's okay DMC you can
[01:38:31] use them um you know that's cool man
[01:38:35] yeah I guess yeah technically if you're
[01:38:38] playing a character you can't swap out
[01:38:39] of like Soo in multi-wave
[01:38:42] content and then it's like you clear
[01:38:43] wave one and you don't want to swap the
[01:38:45] Nita that is the only situation people
[01:38:48] also say it like events and I don't want
[01:38:50] to roast these people that that made
[01:38:52] these videos because I think a lot of
[01:38:54] them all say it in the closing thoughts
[01:38:56] all them make a comment that's an old
[01:38:57] picture of ton by the way um all of them
[01:38:59] say it should you pull can you pull
[01:39:02] would you pull and they all say similar
[01:39:04] stuff but um it's the initial impression
[01:39:07] of like I play without Nita sad n
[01:39:10] without is fine but you just need double
[01:39:11] dendro there's a lot of teams that are
[01:39:12] fine you can do like ya yaa Candace you
[01:39:14] can do like Cole plus like an actual
[01:39:16] dentro
[01:39:18] fine Al them also works on field pretty
[01:39:20] well style and his and his I
[01:39:22] underestimated a lot of NE teams about n
[01:39:24] initially but I I have a better I think
[01:39:26] they're better than I thought they were
[01:39:27] I just I don't know I just don't like to
[01:39:29] I'll talk about it for herun I think to
[01:39:31] pretend that they're like this this
[01:39:32] busted thing and while we're on the
[01:39:36] topic I I have to pull you in here for
[01:39:39] one pull me in hey pull me in closer oh
[01:39:42] my God that was close this
[01:39:44] banner I will actually beat you up I
[01:39:48] will find you true dude [ __ ] this matter
[01:39:52] it is so bad but listen someone donated
[01:39:55] a 100 listen don't okay if you're like a
[01:39:58] dedicated Shia lover and you need the
[01:40:01] fan and your name starts with a z and
[01:40:04] someone donates for you to get it so you
[01:40:06] feel forced to I understand but like you
[01:40:09] shouldn't pull on this weap a better
[01:40:11] that is my advice to you I will chase
[01:40:12] you down I will hunt you down that is my
[01:40:14] advice to you pull on this banner I just
[01:40:16] can't take you seriously I can't respect
[01:40:18] you
[01:40:19] anymore I just
[01:40:21] yeah do do whatever you want thousand
[01:40:24] floating dreams is good it is fine you
[01:40:27] got Nita Juiced up for sure but you can
[01:40:30] also use something like the WID Sith and
[01:40:32] and get so much value to that thing too
[01:40:35] uh it's a it's a you know it's a nice
[01:40:37] thing I hate this B I actually hate this
[01:40:40] don't don't pull on it please if you
[01:40:43] miss how's it bad if you just win true
[01:40:45] actually if you don't have
[01:40:48] cloud
[01:40:49] bler this thing is so bad and only works
[01:40:54] on her it is the worst weapon I think
[01:40:57] that has almost ever dropped it is in
[01:40:58] like the what if you're a sh lover man
[01:41:01] I'm sorry two or three weapons that have
[01:41:03] ever dropped an attack percentage
[01:41:06] scaling piece with a high base attack
[01:41:08] that requires plunging and your other
[01:41:11] units so much reget so bad and you can
[01:41:15] get two of these bad boys you can go
[01:41:17] down the epitomized path you can spend
[01:41:19] no the forest aren't that bad to the
[01:41:21] like when it's sack the forars aren't
[01:41:22] bad sack frags is really good lithic
[01:41:24] spear can be good sack sword is good on
[01:41:26] a few characters sack Bow's okay like
[01:41:27] diona sack great sword could be good but
[01:41:31] there's just not that many um Claymore
[01:41:33] supports that are really good that can
[01:41:35] make use of it but it's fine Navia
[01:41:37] recently can use it like technically
[01:41:39] like Dory cave but you know it's not bad
[01:41:41] hundreds and hundreds of dollars they're
[01:41:43] not bad four stars it's just as well oh
[01:41:46] my God but at the end of the day please
[01:41:48] for the love of God don't hyper invest
[01:41:51] into her just please don't do that and
[01:41:54] and if you're going to do it um here's
[01:41:57] the beautiful thing and I think it was
[01:41:58] in gacha Gamer's video he talked about
[01:42:00] it Sky Atlas passable it's got attack
[01:42:03] percentage here but this is actually a
[01:42:05] pretty awesome option the Prototype yeah
[01:42:07] Z Jeff thinks this is good on shenyun I
[01:42:10] [ __ ] hate it because if I'm playing
[01:42:11] an HP Catalyst on an attack buffing
[01:42:13] character I want to
[01:42:16] [ __ ] I don't like it but it's not bad
[01:42:18] I I mentioned it it's a not bad option
[01:42:20] it gives energy to your team it gives
[01:42:21] her
[01:42:22] energy uh it heals you a little bit wait
[01:42:25] no is it energy to her he's covering the
[01:42:27] effect I'm pretty sure it's energy to
[01:42:28] her and then party members heal or some
[01:42:30] [ __ ] I forget I I could pull it up in my
[01:42:32] inventory uh it's it's it does
[01:42:37] something yeah her energy team healing
[01:42:39] but um it's it's an it's an option for a
[01:42:42] freet to playay option I would argue you
[01:42:44] could use it over like if you don't have
[01:42:45] o o I think is better but if you don't
[01:42:47] have it I would argue using it yeah it's
[01:42:48] nice with finina I would argue using it
[01:42:50] instead of like the attack craftable
[01:42:53] that has no effect because energy and
[01:42:54] energy is good but yeah
[01:42:58] um it it can give you this this energy
[01:43:01] back and uh it's not bad and it also
[01:43:03] heal your team yeah pretty cool option
[01:43:06] um it doesn't have a ton of of attack
[01:43:08] scaling but prototype Amber is a free
[01:43:11] option you can thrilling tails you can
[01:43:13] also out this yes you could F oor if he
[01:43:16] has it get some crit rate and this will
[01:43:18] give you energy recharge so you can use
[01:43:19] your your ultimate more
[01:43:22] I just don't want anyone the [ __ ] is
[01:43:24] this PS4 bow is it good I actually don't
[01:43:27] know what it does is the PS B good chat
[01:43:30] as for the four stars Noel is not ton at
[01:43:37] C6 she's got some
[01:43:40] potential farzon is one of those units
[01:43:44] that only gets a huge chunk of her value
[01:43:47] at
[01:43:48] C6 I hate this I despise this there is
[01:43:52] no character in genin that has ever been
[01:43:55] released and that probably will ever be
[01:43:58] released that I hate more than a c0 C1
[01:44:03] C2 C3 C4 and C5 for on I'm sorry I
[01:44:08] [ __ ] hate it on my freeto playay
[01:44:10] account I'm going to force myself to
[01:44:11] play sh with azero far on but I [ __ ]
[01:44:14] at C6 farzon I love you you're cool
[01:44:17] you're great you're you're welcome to
[01:44:18] the team before C6 I get I see
[01:44:24] red dude not only do you need like 3
[01:44:27] million ER on her you also need 3
[01:44:29] million ER on your other characters cuz
[01:44:31] she doesn't generate energy and she
[01:44:32] doesn't [ __ ] do dude dude dude
[01:44:34] literally your Cloud retainer goes from
[01:44:36] like needing 120 ER in a sh team to like
[01:44:39] 150 or 140 to 170 like it's l or more
[01:44:41] it's l like plus like 50 [ __ ] ER just
[01:44:44] cuz you're far is on who also needs more
[01:44:46] ER is in
[01:44:48] C6 a lot of characters are fine some of
[01:44:52] these constellations are passable they
[01:44:54] give you a little bit more energy or a
[01:44:56] little bit more damage and then it's
[01:44:56] like oh by the way 40% more crit damage
[01:44:59] to these animal units and it's like okay
[01:45:02] I guess uh that's pretty
[01:45:05] crazy it makes you want to pull it you
[01:45:07] get to this thing does more than like a
[01:45:09] lot of people compare it to like Sara or
[01:45:11] something it's it's like literally five
[01:45:12] constellations in one it gives you crit
[01:45:14] damage to ano damage so that's one buff
[01:45:16] then it also spams your skill which does
[01:45:19] damage sure but especially groups
[01:45:21] enemies and generates particles and
[01:45:26] [ __ ] lets you it counts as skill
[01:45:28] damage so you can run a useful set like
[01:45:30] milth four or five constellations and
[01:45:32] you do a couple more PS cuz like if I
[01:45:34] could just unlock this and I just feel
[01:45:35] like it's a scummy tactic and then you
[01:45:39] compare it with someone like Shi yeah
[01:45:41] know [ __ ] far on like I actually even at
[01:45:44] C like I love her C6 but like I don't
[01:45:46] like that everything's locked behind
[01:45:47] well a lot of it's locked
[01:45:49] behind I wouldn't be as tilted if a lot
[01:45:52] of the characters functioned like this
[01:45:54] and they had a lot of value here but
[01:45:56] they keep releasing characters like this
[01:45:59] that have really overall dog trash stuff
[01:46:03] until it's like oh by the way let's just
[01:46:05] nuke everything you're an electro unit
[01:46:08] and uh I just feel like it's cheesy and
[01:46:10] I feel like farzon is one of those one
[01:46:12] of those units that yeah faron's the
[01:46:13] main culprit in my opinion a ton to the
[01:46:15] table that you can't get with other
[01:46:16] characters like you can use her c0 but
[01:46:19] it's just like it's just wor and I feel
[01:46:21] like she's she's just this like bait
[01:46:24] character and then as for that's how the
[01:46:27] company works yeah but like well number
[01:46:29] one I'm not a [ __ ] I'm not a fan of
[01:46:30] gacha you know that but like I like that
[01:46:33] fourstar characters are good I don't
[01:46:35] like it when
[01:46:36] fourstar I don't like when it's like you
[01:46:38] need C6 unlock something like that's
[01:46:40] usually how I feel like
[01:46:42] like I get it if it's like you know
[01:46:44] fal's one like FAL C6 is huge but like
[01:46:47] not only has she been out for 1.0 you
[01:46:49] can get her for free from like the event
[01:46:50] event she might be in the shop I don't
[01:46:51] remember and um she's also even if she
[01:46:56] didn't have her C6 yes she'd be worse
[01:46:58] but she's still good because of her A4
[01:47:00] right still good because of her A4 Faron
[01:47:02] it's like okay you can use her like yeah
[01:47:05] you could use her as a third anemo and a
[01:47:06] sh team and it can technically be
[01:47:07] optimal sometimes but it's just like
[01:47:09] it's literally like a different unit
[01:47:11] it's so like I don't know it's like so
[01:47:14] much in one conation incredible design I
[01:47:17] love the animations I I I really really
[01:47:20] like character uh overall I think really
[01:47:22] fun to play and you can use him with C6
[01:47:25] Bennett and stuff but the big fat of
[01:47:27] flaw is it's a fourar DPS unit which is
[01:47:30] always gonna fall off it's it's always
[01:47:32] GNA fall off um I mean strangling would
[01:47:35] like to know your location I just it's
[01:47:38] hard to be like oh you gotta build this
[01:47:40] guy because you probably have other five
[01:47:43] star units and uh the nice thing is you
[01:47:46] don't really need all these like he gets
[01:47:48] crazier at C6 but he still still pretty
[01:47:51] decent with some plunges he can get some
[01:47:53] vapes going pretty cool he's pretty cool
[01:47:56] at least he's fun but again there's so
[01:47:58] many different like fourstar DPS units
[01:48:00] that okay okay
[01:48:02] okay no disrespect to the diver who
[01:48:05] drowned the first time he dived in the
[01:48:06] archon quest no disrespect MTH but
[01:48:10] please don't put frem and gaming in the
[01:48:13] same sentence it's so many different
[01:48:16] like fourar DPS units that I don't know
[01:48:19] they're just not worth your time and
[01:48:20] effort I'm being honest with you there's
[01:48:22] so many in the game that just can't hang
[01:48:25] but anyways that's it I would skip
[01:48:29] her uh I would get Nita I'm actually
[01:48:32] gonna go for C2 niita just because I
[01:48:34] want it I just want it how you have
[01:48:37] seven all good I don't need it I can
[01:48:39] beat everything in the game super easy
[01:48:41] but I doesn't making four stars too
[01:48:43] strong at C inv validates for five stars
[01:48:44] I mean who cares like as a company I get
[01:48:47] it but as a like gamer consumer who
[01:48:49] cares like I want the four stars to be
[01:48:51] good I don't need my [ __ ] five-star
[01:48:52] like [ __ ] mother figure to be better
[01:48:56] than my four like a lot of what I like
[01:48:58] about genin especially like early four
[01:49:00] stars is okay well I could name like I
[01:49:05] would argue Bennett Sr sucr official
[01:49:07] sometimes B and probably a few others
[01:49:09] that I'm forgetting are better than a
[01:49:11] lot of five stars like limited five
[01:49:13] stars like a lot of
[01:49:15] them I'm a degenerate who likes crazy
[01:49:18] passives and uh that's all about that
[01:49:21] that that's all I have to say I love you
[01:49:23] guys have a good day

[02:15:11] can L piece chat I don't know if you're
[02:15:14] thinking what I'm thinking but I'm
[02:15:15] certainly thinking thoughts right now
[02:15:17] gravestone because of the first Homer
[02:15:19] Banner that versus r five serpent spine
[02:15:22] for
[02:15:23] gaming what uh R4 gravestone is probably
[02:15:41] better um
[02:15:43] yolan I'm going to do a an act that is
[02:15:48] how do I say this it is frowned upon in
[02:15:50] the genin community and that is
[02:15:52] equipping a character on a equipping an
[02:15:54] artifact on a character before leveling
[02:15:56] it now normally this would be uh cursing
[02:15:59] the
[02:16:00] piece but I am very confident I know
[02:16:04] what I can and can't do and I know how
[02:16:06] this is going to roll so we're going to
[02:16:07] roll
[02:16:08] it HP is the worst stat we could get but
[02:16:11] it's not bad for yolan so we take
[02:16:15] it speaking of taking it I will be happy
[02:16:19] to take a crit roll or two we're going
[02:16:22] to throw a piece in here let me find one
[02:16:30] um that's not bad it's not
[02:16:42] bad not
[02:16:46] bad
[02:16:53] um
[02:16:56] oh yeah I know you love me wait what if
[02:17:00] I throw okay I'm never using this I know
[02:17:02] it's not bad but I'm never using that in
[02:17:03] my life all good a live 18
[02:17:06] months not bad for Yan a lot of HP rolls
[02:17:11] but one more crit roll it's good wait
[02:17:15] actually a good piece actually a good
[02:17:18] piece actually a good piece I am curly I
[02:17:21] am curly on an age penis ciret we can
[02:17:24] remove this ciret go more crit and we
[02:17:27] will still have a lot of
[02:17:28] HP actually not bad for
[02:17:31] Yan ER roll HP rolls double crit watch
[02:17:35] this let's say
[02:17:38] hypothetically let's say hypothetically
[02:17:40] that every time we touched I got this
[02:17:43] feeling and let's also assume for the
[02:17:44] sake of argument that every time we
[02:17:46] kissed I swear I could fly
[02:17:48] okay wait a
[02:17:51] second do I need crit
[02:18:07] rate it's actually not
[02:18:12] bad 28k yeah but we're usually like
[02:18:15] double Hydro but if we're double Hydro
[02:18:17] that we don't need as much much ER but
[02:18:19] we're on an HP sand with 200 ER which is
[02:18:21] pretty
[02:18:26] good oh wait I can change my feather
[02:18:28] though do I have a better
[02:18:30] feather I mean this
[02:18:33] one
[02:18:35] anyways so without the passive oh yeah
[02:18:38] she has a passive I forgot about
[02:18:44] that so just proba you rarely do that I
[02:18:46] usually the most common yolan team I
[02:18:48] play is probably yolana
[02:18:54] hyam I knows not bad not bad we take
[02:18:56] those pretty tasty pretty tasty okay
[02:19:00] let's go play
[02:19:03] um let's play
[02:19:10] something let's play
[02:19:13] gaming with shenyun looking

[02:20:02] retainer I think I should work on the
[02:20:05] mats to ascend her

[02:27:15] you
[02:27:19] all
[02:27:39] right okay I'm going to keep pulling
[02:27:42] every time I log into this account it's
[02:27:45] tradition
[02:27:47] Unlucky One More pull I
[02:27:54] think thr Tails unlucky uh I don't even
[02:27:57] have enough star glitter okay we're
[02:28:01] [ __ ]
[02:28:04] anyways [ __ ] you
[02:28:07] pyro quick account
[02:28:10] riew oh I forgot the first
[02:28:13] number smarald
[02:28:17] Shain it looks
[02:28:19] like okay you have less than 2,000
[02:28:22] attack if you're on like death match
[02:28:24] okay I understandable I guess Tu ver
[02:28:26] hasn't too glad respectable
[02:28:28] respectable
[02:28:34] respectable okay no that's fine I just
[02:28:38] know where your biases lie because for
[02:28:41] scar you'd go farm his set but for Shia
[02:28:44] you're on twopiece twopiece that's
[02:28:45] interesting especially considering scar
[02:28:47] set isn't in the strong box and sha is
[02:28:50] so it's interesting to say the least but
[02:28:53] I digress to of a turtle flow Death
[02:28:56] Match all good let's look at your child
[02:28:59] flower that's okay a lot of attack not
[02:29:02] bad
[02:29:03] feather Sans not bad goblet pretty
[02:29:07] cracked ciret pretty good as well got a
[02:29:09] lot of attack uh it looks like you have
[02:29:11] no ER
[02:29:15] you okay
[02:29:17] I don't need ER on my sh because I have
[02:29:19] his first constellation I have C6 farzon
[02:29:21] I have Cloud
[02:29:22] retainer
[02:29:24] fav for you I would recommend a little
[02:29:26] bit of er if you want constructive
[02:29:27] criticism twopiece twopiece is not bad
[02:29:30] obviously now with 4.0 onwards there's
[02:29:32] Mar far mar is just good for your
[02:29:35] account especially if you have finina
[02:29:36] which you do and then you can upgrade to
[02:29:38] that for now two two is fine but I would
[02:29:40] recommend going for a bit of er at least
[02:29:42] like 20 sh doesn't need that much but
[02:29:44] usually more than literally zero right
[02:29:46] uh Scara it looks like you're a scar
[02:29:48] main let's look at your Scara you have
[02:29:49] to of Eternal flow that's good level up
[02:29:51] to 90 it does matter especially for
[02:29:52] attack scaling characters but you know
[02:29:54] level to 90 but still good weapon uh
[02:29:56] four desert Pavilion good also to um
[02:29:59] gets better if you play him with finina
[02:30:00] but a lot of Scar teams can actually use
[02:30:02] finina so that works you could also use
[02:30:03] them on M CH though but whatever talents
[02:30:07] double crown okay uh flower is not bad
[02:30:11] not bad it's okay attack is nice
[02:30:15] feather
[02:30:19] good good good circit overall pretty
[02:30:22] good cuz you have a really high crit
[02:30:23] weapon it's pretty good it's pretty
[02:30:28] good well pretty
[02:30:31] good 6
[02:30:33] months that's all
[02:30:36] right who else do you have let's look at
[02:30:38] your finina finina level 90 Splender of
[02:30:40] Tranquil Waters let's look at the golden
[02:30:41] troop artifact set that is a really good
[02:30:43] flower that is a really good feather I'm
[02:30:44] noticing some favorite renal treat never
[02:30:46] mind the sense kind of sucks uh cir
[02:30:49] goblet is
[02:30:55] okay the first two pieces are really
[02:30:57] good
[02:31:04] though does Lea Alon Shield work with
[02:31:07] ging or will Lila be melting I asked
[02:31:09] sagf but he doesn't have a built
[02:31:11] Leila I mean I also don't have a built
[02:31:14] Lila I don't assume her cry her cry not
[02:31:16] that fast although his pyro is really
[02:31:18] slow but so you would need you could
[02:31:22] probably do Leila Kazo like what you do
[02:31:23] for melt is you do like Rosaria kazua
[02:31:25] and then you cryos swirl the kazua so if
[02:31:28] I assume you do the same with
[02:31:31] Lila like I assume as long as you can
[02:31:33] cryos srl Kazo it should be fine let's
[02:31:36] look at this random account Alum we got
[02:31:39] a light of fure incision that's pretty
[02:31:40] good for Guild of dreams also pretty
[02:31:42] good so far so good constellation zero
[02:31:44] trial Crown I respect it flower is very
[02:31:47] nice like decently nice you know uh if I
[02:31:49] click whoa I can click through all H
[02:31:50] them uh that's good that's terrible
[02:31:54] that's great that's pretty good overall
[02:31:57] no crit rate but it's okay hard to get
[02:31:59] good crit without high them on low five
[02:32:00] because get so much crit damage
[02:32:06] n to for AO would like to see it
[02:32:15] for
[02:32:18] okay okay your ciret redeemed yourself
[02:32:20] also but this is
[02:32:23] okay
[02:32:26] uh I mean you're overcapping
[02:32:30] but get me out get me out of here get me
[02:32:33] out of here I'm sorry get me out of
[02:32:35] here that Circle was insane
[02:32:43] though he R7 dude it's not I don't it's
[02:32:46] just an EU account I don't play on
[02:32:54] [Music]
[02:32:58] it
[02:33:15] sorry
[02:33:23] okay it's time to
[02:33:27] decide what I do right now I think we do
[02:33:30] one click domain run again just to see
[02:33:32] like see if we get
[02:33:37] [Music]
[02:33:45] lucky
[02:33:49] oh
[02:33:53] chat oh maybe I should launch starl as
[02:33:55] well and auto like do some domain runs
[02:33:57] in the background I think I might have
[02:33:58] done my daily domain runs but I need to
[02:33:59] do more I also need to do another golden
[02:34:02] gear stream
[02:34:06] soon I'm ready for Black Swan
[02:34:09] unironically ready
[02:34:15] unironically
[02:34:23] all
[02:34:24] right
[02:34:26] Bennett I probably should not have
[02:34:27] Bennett first did though that was dumb I
[02:34:30] know why I did finina first all
[02:34:33] good
[02:34:38] myal oo good
[02:34:41] damage oo good her
[02:34:45] damage

[02:35:19] your ging's tracked if you think my ging
[02:35:21] is good it might be the team technically

[02:35:26] that there's nothing too special I'm on
[02:35:27] a Vermillion so you could upgrade by
[02:35:29] going a different set um but I mean I
[02:35:31] guess this domain this domain also Buffs

[02:39:20] um I mean you could get a Plunge in with
[02:39:23] if you
[02:39:24] want you going to watch slre Peak
[02:39:26] fiction one piece um okay here's the
[02:39:32] thing let me do some math chat roughly
[02:39:35] how many episodes are in one piece
[02:39:37] roughly roughly how many
[02:39:40] episodes roughly
[02:39:43] chat over a thousand okay how many let's
[02:39:46] say 1,90 how many how many minutes is an
[02:39:51] opening like a minute or
[02:39:55] two two okay let's say times
[02:40:02] two that is 2,000 minutes of anime
[02:40:05] opening let me divide this by
[02:40:08] 60 uh wait yeah divide this by 60 that
[02:40:11] is 36 hours of anime opening actually
[02:40:15] let me times this by 60 uh this is the
[02:40:17] minutes right let me divide it by 20 cuz
[02:40:19] an anime episode is 20 minutes so this
[02:40:21] is 100 episodes of another anime in
[02:40:23] openings now I get you could skip it I
[02:40:25] get it but my point is in just the
[02:40:28] openings of One Piece you could watch
[02:40:30] like
[02:40:31] five listen I will watch it I know it's
[02:40:34] Peak or read it maybe I probably won't
[02:40:36] read because I I don't read but I I will
[02:40:39] watch it okay I'm just
[02:40:42] saying it's it's going to be like it's a
[02:40:44] it's a journey JY it's a journey okay
[02:40:47] it's a
[02:40:48] journey it's a
[02:40:57] journey the only thing I'm like
[02:40:59] congratulations
[02:41:04] yeah my brother my brother was like I
[02:41:07] don't read manga but I bought every
[02:41:09] Hunter Hunter manga just to have them so
[02:41:12] he has them in his house I kind of want
[02:41:14] to read it this cuz I know the next Arc
[02:41:16] is lit
[02:41:18] but I don't
[02:41:21] know okay I'm going to use I'm going to
[02:41:23] use one fragile [ __ ] it and I'm going to
[02:41:24] use one
[02:41:26] Primo okay I said that so people thought
[02:41:29] I was normal that was a lie I'm going to
[02:41:31] do another one sorry now we going
[02:41:40] to is y finina g and Navia a good team
[02:41:43] for Crystal reactions for Navia okay we
[02:41:46] are going to do something called bait or
[02:41:48] new player if it's a new player I'll
[02:41:49] answer truthfully to help educate you if
[02:41:51] it is bait you will be banned 6 oh okay
[02:41:54] uh uh okay so for this team um every
[02:41:58] character you named is good Yi great uh
[02:42:01] guu pretty good finina amazing Navia
[02:42:05] good but together there's a bit of a
[02:42:06] lack of synergy now you can use like G's
[02:42:09] a support Y is a pretty good support um
[02:42:12] and and finina is a great support but in
[02:42:14] that team one you don't have a healer
[02:42:15] unless your fre is on healer but you
[02:42:16] don't want to do that two y Miko and G
[02:42:19] well y could just be played for her
[02:42:21] skill but often times with y a lot of
[02:42:22] teams will run like another Electro or
[02:42:24] with G you'll run another cryo if she's
[02:42:26] a support or even has a DPS so what I
[02:42:28] would do is I would split your teams up
[02:42:31] okay you could do like Navia finina and
[02:42:33] then if you want to be super meta you
[02:42:34] could do like Bennett and then another
[02:42:35] Gio if you want to play y there go ahead
[02:42:37] you could Electro crystallize it'll work
[02:42:40] um or official but you know up to you
[02:42:42] you could put yay there um and yay can
[02:42:44] like not has a little bit of downtime in
[02:42:46] your team so you could do a few normals
[02:42:47] on your eye if you want or like go on
[02:42:49] your eye like e e q e you have time uh I
[02:42:52] would recommend a second Geo and a Navia
[02:42:54] team it alleviates your energy recharge
[02:42:56] needs helps you crystallize more you
[02:42:58] could use Jang le albo as the best if
[02:43:00] not geom MC or ning Wong can be okay or
[02:43:02] you could just do s solo Geo and put
[02:43:04] another character there if you want to
[02:43:05] play ganu I would use her in another
[02:43:08] team
[02:43:10] um just because she doesn't really have
[02:43:11] too much energy
[02:43:13] there but if you want to
[02:43:16] sure but you need the Healer so I would
[02:43:18] or like a shield well with finina you
[02:43:20] need a Healer so I
[02:43:23] yeah you would need a you definitely
[02:43:25] need to healer witho at this point of
[02:43:26] you spent more money on resor characters
[02:43:29] weapons
[02:43:33] um don't talk to me team is don't talk
[02:43:37] to me I [ __ ] on my rotation
[02:43:44] order fam s is a fat
[02:43:47] color uh purple and
[02:43:51] black but I usually say purple so I
[02:43:54] don't have to deal with the black isn't
[02:43:55] a color
[02:43:58] people sorry
[02:44:05] pal okay we're going to do finina auto
[02:44:13] Ben ow Mighty mythical
[02:44:23] Beast go
[02:44:32] woo black is every color
[02:44:41] true I can't reliably soll power on this
[02:44:44] gaming team dude listen here I spent 1
[02:44:48] hour straight going [ __ ] crazy uh
[02:44:51] playing on 150 ping in on the Asia
[02:44:53] server doing deluke this exact team with
[02:44:56] duuke okay I was I swear to God I tried
[02:44:58] to swirl pyro for like almost an hour
[02:45:00] and I like I couldn't get it and then I
[02:45:03] play on my 1520 ping and I get it so I
[02:45:05] actually think it's a ping thing I'm not
[02:45:07] even joking cuz and also [ __ ] mmis
[02:45:10] Caleta decides to attack at random
[02:45:12] moments Fin's [ __ ] does like random
[02:45:14] stuff so sometimes it [ __ ] it up but
[02:45:16] it's I genu like it might be a ping
[02:45:18] issue and if it is just don't swirl pyro
[02:45:20] like it is what it is you ideally want
[02:45:22] to but
[02:45:25] yeah Bennett holdy okay the problem is
[02:45:29] if you take too long in your Bennett
[02:45:30] your frea just shoots
[02:45:36] again but I don't
[02:45:38] know but yeah it's typically like e q
[02:45:42] and then benett Q which I don't have and
[02:45:44] then benett e and then then you swap the
[02:45:45] shenu and if you don't have time to I
[02:45:47] usually do an auto just in case my e
[02:45:48] takes too long cuz your e animation is
[02:45:49] pretty
[02:45:50] long
[02:45:53] CL 200k fog guming does what question
[02:45:57] mark
[02:45:58] sorry Al

[02:46:31] one oh could be good let's lock that
[02:46:35] double crit ER could be
[02:46:44] good
[02:46:46] yeah let the world
[02:46:49] coll teamwork is D sieg the
[02:46:53] SK happy returns sorry
[02:46:58] pal the ging for the team I'm not sure I
[02:47:01] assume deluke c0 is definitely the
[02:47:04] answer C6 ging might be more competitive
[02:47:07] though might be
[02:47:10] better although I'm not sure if with
[02:47:12] chuna changes it I say has a Baseline
[02:47:15] Luke probably
[02:47:16] but with chenu it might be different if
[02:47:19] you're like Nazi 6 Ben cuz you can't
[02:47:20] power plunge as
[02:47:22] much the
[02:47:26] feeling light it up use this fourar
[02:47:29] artifact
[02:47:31] dude instructor literally best of
[02:47:43] slot boom pyro damn that pyro could have
[02:47:46] been so good but I mean attack Y is not
[02:47:49] bad but we would need crit damage on it
[02:47:51] I guess I could roll
[02:48:02] it me with my
[02:48:07] echo that was an instructor yeah but
[02:48:10] with instructor you need a fourar off
[02:48:11] piece cuz the way fourar sets work is if
[02:48:13] you're running a fourar set your off
[02:48:15] piece also has to be a fourar so it
[02:48:16] could have been a good offset piece for
[02:48:17] instructor does that make sense that's
[02:48:20] actually misinformation I just lied to
[02:48:21] you but it would have been cool if that
[02:48:22] was
[02:48:30] true happy

[02:53:48] by the way this one IED with like four
[02:53:50] cuz I was like oh maybe I should do more
[02:53:51] than one I'm pretty sure the like older
[02:53:53] ones were literally like anything before
[02:53:55] that video let me try um fin hey what's
[02:53:58] up guys welcome to my complete and
[02:54:01] detail yeah it's actually so much lower
[02:54:03] quality oh my
[02:54:05] God how did I not notice like I noticed
[02:54:07] but five star anemo support who
[02:54:09] specializes in enabling and buffing
[02:54:11] plunging in today's video we're going to
[02:54:12] be covering plung attacks of your act
[02:54:15] plunge but this isn't Cru different
[02:54:17] voice while you can use your skill three
[02:54:20] times to increase its damage this
[02:54:21] typically isn't recommended unless you
[02:54:22] have I'm reclined in my chair yelling
[02:54:25] right now obviously it's going to sound
[02:54:26] different 130 to 140 otherwise in other
[02:54:30] teams depending on how much energy have
[02:54:31] you never watched a guide from
[02:54:43] me
[02:54:46] hey what's up
[02:54:47] guys yo okay we don't talk about the
[02:54:49] first video I made that was a different
[02:54:51] time that was before puberty that was
[02:54:52] before puberty that was dude that was
[02:54:54] like two years ago that was it is what
[02:54:56] it is it actually is what it is it
[02:54:57] actually is what it is it is what it
[02:55:11] is yo chill
[02:55:15] I just dude I was using like a Blue Yeti
[02:55:17] mic I was like calmer it was like I was
[02:55:22] trying I was different man I was
[02:55:25] different that is really cool when they
[02:55:26] effect procs all like kind of
[02:55:30] change don't talk to me what's like a
[02:55:33] kind of old video hey what's up guys I
[02:55:34] thought I should make a quick and short
[02:55:36] video talk to you guys about some
[02:55:38] mistakes that people make with resin
[02:55:39] spending and I seem to be getting the
[02:55:41] same questions a lot about these things
[02:55:42] and I wait let me look at my weapon what
[02:55:44] do I have show your weapon menu King
[02:55:47] artifacts a lot ofct XP look at how many
[02:55:51] have you need a lot of stuff you can
[02:55:53] throw in right so even if ar40 is not
[02:55:57] the most efficient I think it is still
[02:55:59] smart to farm at ar40 because you're
[02:56:01] going to get some good kind a bad take
[02:56:02] now but three years ago I respect that
[02:56:04] can throw into your artifacts not bad y
[02:56:06] you do get artifact at 40 prioritize
[02:56:08] World bosses prioritize whatever else
[02:56:10] you need that uh you can you know you
[02:56:11] can never mind good take I prep
[02:56:14] avoid the common trap okay what's the
[02:56:16] common trap don't fall in the common
[02:56:17] traps of like I can't Farm artifacts
[02:56:19] till 45 if you choose to wait that's
[02:56:21] fine stop bringing that up don't get
[02:56:22] baited by people saying it's like never
[02:56:24] uh do artifacts before 45 okay the point
[02:56:27] was I remember this the point was like
[02:56:28] you can use like there's a lot of
[02:56:30] domains that like no bless you don't
[02:56:31] give a [ __ ] if it's four star same with
[02:56:32] iridescent ventor and you get like
[02:56:34] artifact XP I'm pretty sure that was a
[02:56:35] take like the thing is if you have other
[02:56:37] stuff to do before 45 sure go ahead and
[02:56:39] wait for artifact a lot of my artifacts
[02:56:42] actually my current some of my current
[02:56:43] dele artifacts are the same for my first
[02:56:45] video in October that I made build
[02:56:49] though all good so I still have some of
[02:56:50] the same artifacts I think one or two
[02:56:52] from I still use this goblet by the way
[02:56:54] and this flow some sets like the vescent
[02:56:57] vener is such a good set that you just
[02:56:58] can run a full fourstar set it'll be
[02:57:00] better than any other option it'll be so
[02:57:02] good and you don't need to focus on like
[02:57:04] leveling your iridescent vener on
[02:57:06] someone like sucros who even with low
[02:57:08] invest forent which I don't have for
[02:57:10] some reason um she'll be very efficient
[02:57:13] as a support which is why I recommend
[02:57:14] after your boss materials after true I
[02:57:16] use level one [ __ ] everything getting
[02:57:18] artifacts at ar45 is smart especially
[02:57:21] because you can use all the forces you
[02:57:22] get as artifact fer as level up material
[02:57:25] for your better artifacts that you will
[02:57:26] eventually get and one of the biggest
[02:57:28] things about farming at ar40 is that you
[02:57:29] can get fourar sets that are actually
[02:57:31] viable late game for example Defenders
[02:57:32] will like no okay this was actually meta
[02:57:35] for albo you don't know those who don't
[02:57:36] know don't know this was once I got
[02:57:38] educated about albo this is actually a
[02:57:40] viable twopiece you before [ __ ] husk
[02:57:42] came out before golden Troop you
[02:57:44] actually could two-piece Defenders will
[02:57:46] two-piece Petra twopiece something else
[02:57:48] I think it was Petra it was actually
[02:57:49] viable is a great option and Theory CRA
[02:57:53] use it on ALB and other four piece sets
[02:57:54] like scholar and gambler are viable okay
[02:57:57] that one was a bit more C we don't talk
[02:57:59] about that but listen this was three
[02:58:00] years ago fourar like FID descent
[02:58:02] because you don't really need the bonus
[02:58:03] stats for them you just need the set
[02:58:05] effect for them to for like an anemo
[02:58:06] support just so that it's efficient and
[02:58:08] obviously eventually if you have time if
[02:58:09] you have resin you can upgrade it but
[02:58:11] that last part is just my opinion like
[02:58:12] you feel free to wait till 45 if you
[02:58:14] want I just want to talk to you guys
[02:58:16] about resin priority and thanks
[02:58:19] man
[02:58:24] anyways dude I haven't made a [ __ ]
[02:58:27] ACC in so long we actually need to do
[02:58:29] one hey what's up guys in this video
[02:58:30] we're going to be talking about the
[02:58:31] strongest characters that you're
[02:58:32] probably not using the most unated
[02:58:34] characters strongest characters before I
[02:58:36] begin I want to say that it is quite
[02:58:38] difficult to evaluate who really is
[02:58:39] underrated because people's opinions 16
[02:58:42] by the way you know from person to
[02:58:44] person but was one of the most
[02:58:46] underrated characters in because she is
[02:58:49] and a lot of the misconceptions
[02:58:50] surrounding her kit before I even show
[02:58:51] you guys some footage of her destroying
[02:58:53] everything let's just take a look at her
[02:58:54] scaling her bir broken what the [ __ ] is
[02:58:58] this oh my God these guys cover each
[02:58:59] other's
[02:59:00] weaknesses an electro battery her Oz
[02:59:02] will generate a ton of Electro getting
[02:59:05] particles that way but overall you can
[02:59:06] play around the 0 energy cost and make
[02:59:08] it not that big of a deal on top of that
[02:59:10] her Elemental skill her Parry is very
[02:59:12] strong especially if you can use it
[02:59:13] corly if you can do it if the next
[02:59:16] character I want to talk about is Jean
[02:59:17] Jean is a character that I don't see
[02:59:19] getting enough praise because she really
[02:59:20] is a very strong support I predicted
[02:59:23] finina actually okay fine who else
[02:59:25] cleanse and heal very very efficient
[02:59:27] cleans actually relevant he's a
[02:59:28] free-to-play character who I made a
[02:59:30] guide on recently and that character is
[02:59:32] k k is extremely flexible because he can
[02:59:34] be a strong DPS in like a freeze comp he
[02:59:36] can also be a great off field support or
[02:59:37] like a sub DPS who can apply cry to
[02:59:39] enemies and deal massive amounts of
[02:59:41] damage with his strong bursts even more
[02:59:44] crit in the Melt quick swap on her
[02:59:46] because the character I've been talking
[02:59:47] about for months over half a year on my
[02:59:49] stream and someone who Theory Crafters
[02:59:51] have been loving that character is Shang
[02:59:53] Ling okay bro okay all right how old is
[02:59:55] this same power level June she is a very
[02:59:59] strong option for all right
[03:00:04] well back when Shang Ling was
[03:00:07] underrated good times good
[03:00:12] times
[03:00:34] okay I'm not one to react to old
[03:00:37] videos
[03:00:39] however zff recently told me hey man
[03:00:44] wait actually I can't find it what the
[03:00:46] [ __ ] is
[03:00:49] it actually never mind I can't find it
[03:00:52] oh wait is it this
[03:01:02] oh
[03:01:04] anyways [ __ ] is
[03:01:12] this
[03:01:19] wa what happened one sec
[03:01:35] chat as I walk through the valley of
[03:01:38] Shang
[03:01:42] Ling I thought sorry I'll tweeted
[03:01:44] something wait chat what day is peny I
[03:01:47] need to plan my streams cuz I need to do
[03:01:48] like gen until I'm done the new [ __ ]
[03:01:51] then star for all the new [ __ ] like I
[03:01:52] need to like be ready cuz I don't want
[03:01:54] to like not be ready for starl 4th of
[03:01:58] February 6th okay more people are saying
[03:02:01] six at four six makes sense cuz it's a
[03:02:03] Tuesday but it might be is it okay that
[03:02:06] that works I'll be ready for sure okay
[03:02:09] I'll be ready for
[03:02:12] sure
[03:02:15] Oh Black Swan is uh probably going to be
[03:02:18] very straightforward which is good
[03:02:22] because I will be very well we'll see
[03:02:24] but I feel very confident in a lot of
[03:02:27] her but we don't know yet but when she's
[03:02:29] out but then after I need to the only
[03:02:33] thing I have with STL is I haven't
[03:02:34] played a lot of the characters that I
[03:02:35] haven't leveled which limits my
[03:02:37] knowledge for certain characters like
[03:02:38] genin it's like I feel like even though
[03:02:39] some of the characters I don't level I
[03:02:41] know like every use not every use case
[03:02:43] like if you ask me like Lea if it's
[03:02:44] enough [ __ ] cryo for certain teams I
[03:02:46] might not know but like for a lot of
[03:02:48] stuff I feel like I do whereas s I'm
[03:02:51] missing a lot of certain characters that
[03:02:52] are more like either Niche or that I
[03:02:53] don't personally play so I need to like
[03:02:55] I need to like update myself on
[03:02:58] that but yeah yeah know it does feel
[03:03:00] really hard to level for me in start I
[03:03:02] don't know why Julian like I literally I
[03:03:04] spent my trail base power literally
[03:03:06] every day at least for the past past
[03:03:09] month I want to say most days since
[03:03:10] release but there's some days where I
[03:03:11] didn't log in but like at least for like
[03:03:13] one to two months straight and I like
[03:03:15] still can't level all my relics or like
[03:03:17] characters I want to level like I'm
[03:03:19] always [ __ ] I have credits but I'm
[03:03:21] broke on everything else I don't know
[03:03:22] why maybe it's cuz I level more
[03:03:24] characters than like average person CU I
[03:03:26] want to build many teams but it feels
[03:03:28] like it's so costly even the like Trace
[03:03:30] materials whatever they're called well
[03:03:32] yeah Trace materials so expensive like
[03:03:34] the the
[03:03:36] cxes at least you don't have to wait for
[03:03:38] a specific day but yeah the drops feel
[03:03:40] so like L like yeah un you don't even
[03:03:42] get a purple
[03:03:44] [Music]
[03:03:45] oh sa in genin to be fair but you know
[03:03:49] it does feel really costly
[03:03:53] yeah you need 20 days to Max one
[03:03:56] character
[03:04:07] really not if you swipe true actually
[03:04:11] all right let's do an abyss run and in

[03:27:26] that caught me off guard this is this is
[03:27:28] definitive proof that I don't think any
[03:27:30] of these people actually know what the
[03:27:31] [ __ ] they're talking about I've seen

[03:28:28] like I agree that some content in genin
[03:28:31] is I can't pause oh I'm lagging I agree
[03:28:35] that some content in genjin is
[03:28:36] unoriginal but I also think that a lot
[03:28:39] of it is like genjin just doesn't have
[03:28:40] content like like there's a reason why
[03:28:43] everyone like Ys from each other like
[03:28:45] it's literally
[03:28:47] like I'm pretty sure I started a account
[03:28:49] reviews when I saw slice do one like
[03:28:51] three years ago and now everyone does I
[03:28:53] don't know who started it I'm not going
[03:28:54] to be like oh I started account doesn't
[03:28:55] matter but like everyone does count riew
[03:28:58] everyone does Abyss randomizer I don't
[03:28:59] know who did the first Abyss like
[03:29:00] there's so much [ __ ] that it's like well
[03:29:02] what are you going to do just Abyss like
[03:29:04] o Abyss viewer PS like strong balls this
[03:29:06] this this like there's so much [ __ ] that
[03:29:08] it's like it's like you kind of have to
[03:29:10] make your own content and I've noticed
[03:29:12] very early on this is just chatting
[03:29:14] impact like that's what it
[03:29:15] is it's just chatting with a background
[03:29:18] but that's good cuz then people you
[03:29:19] trick people into watching you for you
[03:29:20] and now if I Branch out into like oh
[03:29:22] we're playing Star Wars oh I'm playing

[03:32:11] university year um which is pretty POG
[03:32:13] and it's like funded by the government I

[03:38:28] I'm going to go unlock that Waypoint
[03:38:30] wait what the [ __ ] wait what gameplay
[03:38:32] tutorial oh that's pretty
[03:38:37] [Music]
[03:38:39] cool
[03:38:43] you team to G sh let let a casual player
[03:38:48] play who they
[03:38:49] like dude I actually I feel so bad for
[03:38:52] like genin variety like variety
[03:38:55] streamers that play genin I would watch
[03:38:57] dude they get back seated so hard like
[03:39:00] I'll watch like tens play genin like a
[03:39:02] year ago or like anyone the variety
[03:39:04] against a gget it's like literally like
[03:39:06] any team C or character they play they
[03:39:09] just get [ __ ] shot off
[03:39:11] it's so
[03:39:18] sad I mean it depends I personally like
[03:39:21] it like if I'm like asking about
[03:39:22] something and people help me I like it
[03:39:24] but sometimes it's like you're just
[03:39:24] trying to chill and then people back to
[03:39:26] you that's it depends on the streamer
[03:39:28] but usually it's
[03:39:35] annoying hurts my meta slave
[03:39:39] eyes get genin brain rot
[03:39:43] aware r one play what you like
[03:39:46] true I mean I've told you my theory of
[03:39:49] optimal genin enjoyment my theory of
[03:39:50] optimal optimal gin enjoyment is picking
[03:39:53] your favorite character building a team
[03:39:55] around them that makes sense with
[03:39:56] characters that you like but like
[03:39:59] building a team that's like that works
[03:40:01] so like let's say your favorite
[03:40:03] character like random character could be
[03:40:04] anyone I'm just going to click if your
[03:40:05] favorite character is Eugen what I would
[03:40:07] do is be like okay well I would play a
[03:40:08] normal attacking character that I like
[03:40:10] like maybe Yia maybe like Ayo even
[03:40:11] though he's not the best with her
[03:40:12] whatever and then build a functional
[03:40:14] team that can clear the abyss but as
[03:40:16] long as you have like your favorite
[03:40:17] character on the team now if you're just
[03:40:18] like hey I want four characters that I
[03:40:19] like you can do that Allan thanks for 18

[04:24:38] [ __ ] the problem with the okay that's

[04:39:14] ourselves [ __ ] it I'm the dealer now
[04:39:19] dealer we're
[04:39:23] winning this isn't endless mode we just
[04:39:26] have to win on hard
[04:39:29] mode magnifying glass we only have one
[04:39:33] item three
[04:39:35] [Music]
[04:39:37] you should have enough footage for a
[04:39:38] YouTube video now okay I just want to
[04:39:39] win though you can stop pretending okay
[04:39:43] okay okay I'll play I'll play real now
[04:39:44] I'll play real watch
[04:39:47] this I mean there's no reason not to
[04:39:49] check there's actually no reason not
[04:39:52] to
[04:39:56] okay shoot
[04:40:01] him
[04:40:02] okay that's fine
[04:40:07] it's fine odds are he shoots a blank now
[04:40:09] which means I'm not afraid that's
[04:40:12] fine now it's
[04:40:17] 50/50 okay of
[04:40:23] course oh wait it wasn't wait I
[04:40:27] miscounted never
[04:40:30] mind bro I playing at 1440p it's a it's
[04:40:34] the W it's the
[04:40:39] style
[04:40:42] Meg all right we're doubling it up
[04:40:44] double it or give it to the next person
[04:40:46] GG we win round one GG we win round one
[04:40:48] round one's over we won not a drill by
[04:40:50] the way we won round
[04:40:57] one let me change my
[04:41:03] title okay
[04:41:06] winning Gamba winning all
[04:41:09] gambas cuz from now on we're only
[04:41:14] winning okay what do we get give me one
[04:41:16] magnifying glass and I promise you we
[04:41:18] win okay we win okay that's literally
[04:41:20] all we
[04:41:22] got
[04:41:23] okay one to two the more lives the less
[04:41:28] it's fluke and the more you can showcase
[04:41:30] your skills so here's my reasoning if
[04:41:32] I'm magnifying glass and it's a blank
[04:41:35] if I blank myself then there's a 66%
[04:41:37] chance I win the round if I magnify
[04:41:39] glass right now and it's a blank I can
[04:41:42] shoot myself then it's 50/50 that I win
[04:41:44] the round if
[04:41:50] I if I shoot myself and it hits that he
[04:41:53] gets two
[04:41:57] blanks no I think I feel like I have to
[04:42:01] mag
[04:42:02] oh thank God
[04:42:09] does this guy ever shut up okay all
[04:42:12] right now it's just two
[04:42:18] blanks I mean those odds weren't bad
[04:42:20] right cuz there's a 33% chance that
[04:42:22] there we get the shot and then after
[04:42:24] that it's a
[04:42:33] 50/50
[04:42:36] wait did the did the [ __ ] dealer just
[04:42:38] use his magnet all right handu all right
[04:42:40] okay handcuffs are
[04:42:42] good 32 3
[04:42:52] four can I put it back down no I can't
[04:42:55] well it's three four it'd be done not to
[04:42:57] do
[04:42:59] you every time it's fine it's
[04:43:03] fine yeah use your item I'm not
[04:43:06] afraid he can't kill me here
[04:43:08] statistically even if he shoots me even
[04:43:10] if he shoots me twice statistically he
[04:43:12] can't kill me that's fine he

[04:49:12] [Music]
[04:49:15] winable he's a [ __ ]
[04:49:19] idiot
[04:49:23] what wait okay sometimes in life you get
[04:49:26] a chance and it's the if if you get one
[04:49:28] chance one opportunity would you seize
[04:49:31] it it's the the people that seize
[04:49:35] that's over
[04:49:36] right oh
[04:49:40] [ __ ] it's fine it's one to one that was
[04:49:43] the last round it's e it's even now it
[04:49:45] that was the last
[04:49:47] round run it back cuz in life it's not
[04:49:51] about just getting lucky but it's seeing
[04:49:53] an opportunity not everyone gets an
[04:49:55] opportunity but if you get it you have
[04:49:56] to capitalize on it and that's what I I
[04:49:59] I'm learning in this game so look two
[04:50:02] three
[04:50:05] two three right watch
[04:50:07] this if I blank myself there's a three
[04:50:10] out of two
[04:50:12] chance that's not how it works it's two
[04:50:14] out of three out of five chance that we
[04:50:16] win three out of two I'm an idiot but no
[04:50:20] reason not to
[04:50:23] magnifying okay we just
[04:50:27] win okay
