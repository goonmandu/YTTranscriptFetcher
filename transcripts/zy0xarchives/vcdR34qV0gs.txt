[01:31:58] six
[01:32:03] I've been infusible I can see it gives
[01:32:05] you damage fertility because the damage
[01:32:07] is usable

[01:32:12] last one
[01:32:15] all right
[01:32:17] what was that
[01:32:19] Kafka apogus true
[01:32:22] dude actually I've been starting
[01:32:24] pre-firing for Kafka I'm not done wait
[01:32:25] but I like from what I guess she's gonna
[01:32:28] use obviously we don't know obviously we
[01:32:30] don't know but I'm guessing
[01:32:32] um but with that in mind uh uh I like
[01:32:34] like I'm gonna like Farm like the
[01:32:35] Hillary mats uh and like and like what I
[01:32:38] think she might use that's all
[01:32:42] because we know she's lightning right we
[01:32:44] know she's lightning right because of
[01:32:46] the trial at the start of the game so we
[01:32:48] know that so we know it so I'm just
[01:32:50] farming like uh I'm farming like just in
[01:32:52] case I'm farming shape of Doom but I
[01:32:53] don't know if she's gonna need it like
[01:32:54] how would I know it's just I assume
[01:32:56] she's gonna use it my lighting set kind
[01:32:57] of sucks balls though we probably should
[01:32:58] Farm uh lightning stuff but we'll figure
[01:33:01] it out
[01:33:06] you haven't done your weeklies you're a
[01:33:08] weekly

[01:33:13] probably do this
[01:33:15] I haven't done simulated Universe this
[01:33:17] week because I only do some really
[01:33:18] Universe when I stream but I haven't
[01:33:20] experience I didn't see Charlotte since
[01:33:21] actually I did stream style I don't know

[01:44:23] HP made that it doesn't matter like do
[01:44:26] you like do I care about brownie doing a
[01:44:28] bit of damage not really I don't want
[01:44:29] her to die
[01:44:36] um
[01:44:42] it's like let me turn this down a little
[01:44:47] I don't know how to just turn it all
[01:44:48] down
[01:44:50] bold ball
[01:44:54] what's that excited chat uh
[01:45:05] uh okay this should be fine now
[01:45:09] sorry uh uh I was just figuring this out
[01:45:12] text-to-speech settings
[01:45:14] okay
[01:45:16] oh yeah also yeah because my I think
[01:45:18] it's because my gesture artifact luck
[01:45:19] has been so [ __ ] uh I don't know if you
[01:45:22] guys saw last stream this wasn't even
[01:45:23] the start of stream this is last gentian
[01:45:25] stream at the end we rolled a star rail
[01:45:27] piece for no reason and it rolled this
[01:45:29] so we now have our blade is like [ __ ]
[01:45:32] cracked like it like we needed the four
[01:45:34] launch move but even just now he's
[01:45:36] [ __ ] insane
[01:45:38] um yeah he is like insane like because
[01:45:40] we have this which is really [ __ ]
[01:45:42] good we have this which is really
[01:45:43] [ __ ] good we have this which is
[01:45:45] [ __ ] instant well I mean seven speed
[01:45:46] pretty [ __ ] good this which is 22
[01:45:49] crit damage that's like pretty good this
[01:45:51] is a really good also has that HP roll
[01:45:54] so it's better than it looks
[01:45:55] and then whatever okay our rope is is
[01:45:57] useless but
[01:45:59] yeah
[01:46:01] so we need to get a better rope uh I
[01:46:04] think I just low-key haven't gotten I
[01:46:06] don't know if I've thrown away HP robes
[01:46:08] because I was dumb
[01:46:11] or if I just never got a good one I
[01:46:13] don't know but we do need a new HP rope
[01:46:16] um
[01:46:17] and I do want to go the four piece
[01:46:20] but I don't know if I have like I've
[01:46:24] been farming this set off stream I got a
[01:46:26] career one there but like there's no sub
[01:46:28] stat I mean there's HP percent it's
[01:46:29] gonna be good and it might roll crew
[01:46:31] damage
[01:46:32] I [ __ ] it
[01:46:36] Chris damage and I caught
[01:46:40] it's okay it's all right
[01:46:44] ah yeah
[01:46:52] get us a 12. I might as well I guess
[01:47:01] Carrie this is actually not bad anymore
[01:47:05] uh I mean it's fine
[01:47:08] we can use it
[01:47:13] it's not bad
[01:47:15] what's the other piece flower so or
[01:47:17] whatever this is called hat uh this
[01:47:20] one's really good but if we want to go
[01:47:22] the four piece we need another one so
[01:47:24] let's see what we have do you have any
[01:47:25] that's no Okay so
[01:47:27] the ones that I have locked are this one
[01:47:28] that could be good this one
[01:47:31] this one this one oh I guess it's for
[01:47:34] support character this one and this one
[01:47:38] whoa why is this
[01:47:40] where the [ __ ]
[01:47:49] boss Jeff
[01:47:51] wait okay the double roll to HP like the
[01:47:54] second one is not needed but we got HP
[01:47:56] this has eight oh my [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:48:01] okay well I mean we're using this okay
[01:48:03] well we have four piece
[01:48:04] dude all of my this is decay
[01:48:08] before I roll this
[01:48:10] I would much rather have gentian luck
[01:48:12] okay I don't know why all my luck is
[01:48:14] here but we're just gonna I'm not gonna
[01:48:16] complain we're just gonna roll it
[01:48:20] that's arguably the worst dot but
[01:48:23] speed's still good on him
[01:48:26] Chris damage crit damage that's good
[01:48:31] that's good yeah I mean every stat is
[01:48:33] good it doesn't matter like speed is
[01:48:35] good HP is good but we'd rather get crit
[01:48:36] here
[01:48:39] wait what if I leave it 666 because
[01:48:41] Blade's edgy
[01:48:45] it's fine
[01:48:46] I mean like there's literally no battle
[01:48:48] rolls create would have been nice but
[01:48:50] you know
[01:48:51] it doesn't matter like it's not it's
[01:48:53] still amazing
[01:48:55] wait so what is our ratio like if we go
[01:48:57] for langavus
[01:49:02] no okay uh we'll get our current damage
[01:49:06] yo we'll go we'll go crit damage on the
[01:49:09] on the on the body we'll go crit damage
[01:49:10] we'll do this
[01:49:13] okay that's actually good that's
[01:49:15] actually not bad uh and this only plus
[01:49:17] 12. so it could be more
[01:49:27] the subsets I mean oh no it has HP I
[01:49:29] didn't see that okay it's actually not
[01:49:30] bad yeah that's just not on [ __ ] it I
[01:49:33] fired a lot of credits off stream I
[01:49:35] remember last time I streamed I used all
[01:49:36] my credits gearing Pila we built a DPS
[01:49:38] pillow and you guys got mad at me for it
[01:49:40] and then we had like literally like 1K
[01:49:42] credits and I farmed like two million so
[01:49:44] yeah
[01:49:48] okay well
[01:49:50] that is awkward
[01:49:55] uh this could be good actually
[01:49:57] no I can't
[01:50:15] right
[01:50:16] I mean that's fine
[01:50:20] Arisha 76 159 on set now we this is what
[01:50:24] it looked like on TV series this is on
[01:50:26] set imagine I get a good rope like this
[01:50:28] HP so uh pretend like I'm gonna put an
[01:50:31] attack on pretend it's HV but like let's
[01:50:33] have like this wait why isn't this 15 by
[01:50:35] the way dude do I not care about Sealy
[01:50:37] why do I only care about Blake yo this
[01:50:38] is [ __ ] up to Sealy I should level
[01:50:40] this
[01:50:41] wait let me level this uh do I have
[01:50:43] anything I can add into it
[01:50:47] I love silly
[01:50:51] no that's good that's good that's [ __ ]
[01:51:03] that's a waste right how much Xperia do
[01:51:05] I get
[01:51:11] that's always unlock the four stars dude
[01:51:14] but four stars are usable
[01:51:17] like look look dude I can use this no I
[01:51:20] can't no I can't you get it back yeah
[01:51:23] actually yeah that is true that's yeah
[01:51:24] true send it
[01:51:26] okay well uh at least you got more
[01:51:30] attack on it all good but like okay
[01:51:31] let's say for example my engine has a
[01:51:33] good one no he doesn't wait who has a
[01:51:35] good one I have another good one where
[01:51:36] is it
[01:51:37] I swear oh that one well that's ageless
[01:51:40] whatever let's add this right let's say
[01:51:42] like this was the Chris that's I had
[01:51:45] 74 171 that would be [ __ ] insane so
[01:51:49] uh also there's more Critter right here
[01:51:51] actually I forgot about that so that's
[01:51:53] Plus 16.
[01:51:55] damn
[01:51:56] low q1 even more crit damage then
[01:52:02] yeah we'll go for the HP one we have
[01:52:03] right now
[01:52:08] you have another HP one
[01:52:10] I love h
[01:52:15] uh yeah I can't do this it's on
[01:52:18] bellabong bro this [ __ ] is on Bella bug
[01:52:21] of the ancient of The Architects
[01:52:26] yeah we're gonna have to farm an HP one

[01:53:09] okay we can literally ignore and Brute
[01:53:11] Force I'm not even kidding you're
[01:53:13] actually just brute force it
[01:53:15] I'm like pretty sure we can brute force
[01:53:18] it we'll do
[01:53:20] yeah I might be wrong maybe not but I'm
[01:53:22] pretty sure we can
[01:53:27] uh do we care about the last character
[01:53:38] your farming 6 for HP rope yes but Chad
[01:53:41] said seven and I can't make decisions on
[01:53:43] my own so I'm doing seven does that make
[01:53:45] sense

[02:09:27] you want
[02:09:28] but
[02:09:31] I feel like it's a waste of talent
[02:09:32] because you're probably very talented
[02:09:34] and I don't want that to go to waste
[02:09:37] um also I'm
[02:09:40] yeah
[02:09:51] oh my God that's very [ __ ] hot

[02:10:10] I should play Gadget dude today's luck
[02:10:11] is insane
[02:10:13] downloader actually don't let anyone
[02:10:17] what's up erda
[02:10:18] how you doing
[02:10:21] um
[02:10:29] I'm gonna do this not because it's like
[02:10:32] that good because it's gonna look like
[02:10:34] big [ __ ] of damage so
[02:10:38] I mean it actually is good we're gonna
[02:10:39] do it because we're gonna weakness break
[02:10:41] uh cocolia
[02:10:55] [ __ ] it
[02:10:59] bucket we don't need upgrades wait I
[02:11:02] have nothing to break this oh absolutely
[02:11:03] nevermind I mean
[02:11:05] yeah we are not Shield breaking this
[02:11:07] wait I didn't even I missed it
[02:11:10] it's fine it's gonna be easy I meant
[02:11:14] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[02:11:17] I didn't use a single technique by the
[02:11:19] way oh good though it doesn't matter
[02:11:20] this game is easy
[02:11:27] surely right
[02:11:30] surely it doesn't matter right
[02:11:39] wait
[02:11:43] my body is faster than my blade I just
[02:11:46] realized
[02:11:52] waiting
[02:11:55] Reigns one's bigger
[02:12:00] the paradise Miss savor it for me
[02:12:04] we've just changed our build it's not my
[02:12:06] fault
[02:12:07] it's literally not my fault to change
[02:12:08] our builds
[02:12:10] tremble before my power
[02:12:17] can I have fun I think his game is gonna
[02:12:19] crash dude how can you predict that I
[02:12:21] was also getting that feeling that's
[02:12:22] crazy that you were also feeling that
[02:12:30] don't you say that Brian should be
[02:12:31] faster than DPS no
[02:12:33] that Brian should have one less speed
[02:12:35] than your blade
[02:12:38] because you want blade to act twice in a
[02:12:40] row
[02:12:41] unless you're like turbo speed like
[02:12:43] there's like a
[02:12:44] they do like Omega speed but you don't
[02:12:46] really like your body can like overlap
[02:12:48] but you don't really want that well you
[02:12:51] might want that but that's like yeah
[02:12:52] different
[02:12:56] time for a bug why should I press r
[02:13:05] this battle is unavoidable
[02:13:09] lend me your strength
[02:13:11] and select twice in a row though no yes
[02:13:13] but it doesn't like
[02:13:18] let's say Blake goes first he does
[02:13:20] whatever he needs to do then it's bronya
[02:13:22] then Brady makes blade go again and then
[02:13:24] he does whatever he did but again
[02:13:26] so it's just like an extra turn like why
[02:13:28] wouldn't you do it
[02:13:41] repay yeah we're fine we're not gonna
[02:13:44] die here
[02:13:45] actually I'm gonna press R for fun
[02:13:51] I shouldn't have pressed R for fun
[02:13:52] actually they should be dead right
[02:14:06] I could cleanse her but uh
[02:14:09] uh
[02:14:15] holy [ __ ]
[02:14:17] I guess we'll cleanser
[02:14:27] good
[02:14:28] Ness
[02:14:31] oh that was bad that was so [ __ ] why
[02:14:34] did I do that that's fine
[02:14:36] that was a dumb R though
[02:14:42] yeah that's fine
[02:14:50] yes
[02:14:52] okay uh
[02:14:55] uh Auto attack we don't need to heal
[02:15:00] you guys aren't ready for this hit
[02:15:11] savor it for me
[02:15:14] well her death has been shredded so that

[02:20:41] okay what the [ __ ] is this it's a work
[02:20:43] in progress but it's not even like bad I
[02:20:46] just my light cone doesn't give crit so
[02:20:48] the ju as you see are our bigger uh uh
[02:20:51] numbers okay shut the [ __ ] up listen I
[02:20:54] don't listen I don't have a crit icon
[02:20:55] okay so it looks worse than it is it's
[02:20:58] actually not even that bad it's just a
[02:21:00] work in progress like like
[02:21:03] look at this that's not bad
[02:21:06] that's not bad look I like like like
[02:21:15] what if I level the defense boots just
[02:21:17] to make it look like it's good
[02:21:27] okay it is pretty bad but our our hat is
[02:21:30] good our gloves are good
[02:21:33] our bodies replaceable our feet are our
[02:21:36] could be better and our ball sucks
[02:21:41] front of speed true I actually forgot
[02:21:43] again
[02:21:53] she still has more [ __ ]
[02:21:57] um
[02:22:00] foreign
[02:22:34] what if I do
[02:22:43] hmm
[02:22:45] I don't think I have another plus 15
[02:22:46] crit body that's not on someone I use
[02:22:51] that okay well I guess I could level
[02:22:53] another one or I could get my blade one
[02:22:55] speed but my Blade's really good I don't
[02:22:56] want to [ __ ] with them
[02:23:17] um we need one speed uh
[02:23:22] I guess I'll just reduce her speed we
[02:23:24] could remove this body
[02:23:32] [ __ ]
[02:23:43] I did this
[02:23:46] that's 104. I'll just need to level the
[02:23:48] crew damage body all the way up
[02:23:50] but I don't really have
[02:23:53] I don't really have mats to level
[02:23:57] like I don't have relics XP
[02:24:12] oh
[02:24:13] I mean that's not really that's really
[02:24:15] good but I wouldn't want that on bronya
[02:24:16] then it's like almost too good for Rania
[02:24:18] because I give that someone else
[02:24:21] I mean might as well level it I guess
[02:24:22] sure
[02:24:26] use Blade's old robe good idea
[02:24:29] oh it's right there
[02:24:33] okay well all right well uh I mean it's
[02:24:38] still brawny just wants to crit damage
[02:24:39] it's fine like we don't even care about
[02:24:41] the sub stats for bronia for other
[02:24:43] characters yeah but for bronia like it
[02:24:45] is what it is we'll just leave that 13
[02:24:46] for now whatever
[02:24:47] awkward number but it's fine okay she
[02:24:49] has one last feed then played perfect
[02:24:52] I wish our blade had more speed but
[02:24:54] doesn't matter
[02:24:55] a little more
[02:25:01] nothing major favorite for me
[02:25:05] okay listen
[02:25:07] dude does this name look French how
[02:25:10] would I know how to pronounce it
[02:25:13] that's because I'm British true
[02:25:16] uh let me think
[02:25:25] oh I was out haunted yeah also [ __ ]
[02:25:29] grizzly bear that's how you pronounce it
[02:25:33] I actually don't know how to pronounce
[02:25:34] it
[02:25:36] I know how to say never yet
[02:25:39] I don't honestly Risley or realistically
[02:26:08] there's probably a video on it by like
[02:26:10] some old British dude
[02:26:12] Ryo faceli genshin pronounced
[02:26:17] let's see
[02:26:21] savor it for me
[02:26:25] speech modification let's go
[02:26:29] speechmodification.com presents
[02:26:31] how to pronounce
[02:26:33] Risley wait uh this was actually just
[02:26:36] says Risley
[02:26:38] Risley all right call me [ __ ] Risley
[02:26:43] let's look at an old ass video it's like
[02:26:45] six years ago
[02:26:50] oh God
[02:26:54] Risley or risely
[02:26:56] risely nah Risley sounds worse because
[02:26:59] there is
[02:27:01] Rye uh sleep
[02:27:05] roughly
[02:27:06] you okay I'm calling him grizzly
[02:27:14] that doesn't sound anything like this
[02:27:15] one
[02:27:16] I don't speechmodification.com presents
[02:27:20] how to pronounce
[02:27:21] Risley
[02:27:24] wait Gadget character ain't no way
[02:27:39] what if someone what if there's like
[02:27:41] what if there's someone called that
[02:27:42] right now what do they think
[02:27:47] foreign defense set [ __ ] you I'm trying
[02:27:49] to get [ __ ] you actually [ __ ] you I'm
[02:27:51] not gonna answer that
[02:27:55] is your body build it doesn't matter
[02:27:56] it's just stacker damage like she's on
[02:27:58] like HP so she doesn't die but uh maybe
[02:28:00] you want to see my my uh sphere actually
[02:28:03] 29 yeah no big deal on on the set by the
[02:28:05] way on the crit damage set on the yeah
[02:28:07] no big deal no big deal oh do we [ __ ]
[02:28:09] our effect rest wait do we still have
[02:28:10] enough
[02:28:15] okay cool
[02:28:20] yeah so there you go
[02:28:22] just in case you're wondering because
[02:28:23] you might have been wondering so no big
[02:28:25] deal
[02:28:33] ask me how to pronounce things I don't
[02:28:35] know it's probably like it's in French
[02:28:37] it's but I'm probably not going to say
[02:28:40] that I'll probably say for a minute
[02:28:40] because I don't care that much I don't
[02:28:42] know we'll see I haven't decided yet I
[02:28:45] don't know what's correct until I say it
[02:28:47] and I hear other people say it
[02:28:55] why HP on bronya uh just so she doesn't
[02:28:57] die because like like you can give her
[02:28:59] attack but it doesn't matter like sure
[02:29:01] Oliver utility comes from crit damage so
[02:29:03] like it doesn't really matter and like
[02:29:05] speed I guess but
[02:29:09] probably what they say in game
[02:29:12] the Justice from an A
[02:29:14] okay but the Jeff also says Oiler
[02:29:21] it might be like I might say for a
[02:29:23] minute because that's like the way to
[02:29:24] say it in French without saying in
[02:29:25] French kind of like Fontan
[02:29:28] foreign
[02:29:29] I don't know yet
