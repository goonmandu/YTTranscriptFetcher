[00:14:24] this time
[00:14:26] we feel like it I'm leaning towards yes
[00:14:28] but we'll see
[00:14:30] uh and that's one for today now for some
[00:14:32] other things to note
[00:14:46] wait where is it
[00:15:16] but if you didn't see already
[00:15:18] uh I uploaded the I I'll put the video
[00:15:21] that was shipping out like two weeks ago
[00:15:22] but it's up now the wander and kokomi
[00:15:24] review that show was like 32 minutes but
[00:15:26] I trimmed it to like 26 which is still
[00:15:27] long but it's not bad it's digestible
[00:15:30] now so if you want to watch it it's out
[00:15:32] no 24. it's actually better dude it was
[00:15:34] like 30. I turned the bunch it's
[00:15:36] actually doing it's actually like pretty
[00:15:37] bald you should go watch it it's pretty
[00:15:39] cool there's like a three minute farazon
[00:15:41] guide for no reason in the middle but
[00:15:43] it's pretty POG so go watch it uh also
[00:15:45] speaking of uh farazone guide let me
[00:15:48] actually show you guys something one
[00:15:49] second one second one second here's a
[00:15:52] spoiler here's a spoiler for a short
[00:15:54] that's gonna be uploaded yup you're
[00:15:56] getting [ __ ] spoiled watch this wait
[00:15:58] this is 125 megabytes okay it's
[00:16:00] downloading
[00:16:07] someone super chatted five dollars what
[00:16:10] are you doing up this late baby girl
[00:16:12] dude what are you
[00:16:14] okay anyways
[00:16:16] that's not short that's coming out
[00:16:18] far like a toothbrush now farzan at C6
[00:16:21] is like a fully functioning toothbrush
[00:16:23] not the toothbrush again wow I can't
[00:16:25] live
[00:16:29] toothpick
[00:16:33] but it's not as efficient as a
[00:16:35] toothbrush it's not even close and once
[00:16:37] you have the toothbrush like dude I can
[00:16:39] never go back to the toothpick so that's
[00:16:41] the difference between c0 and C6 bars on
[00:16:42] for those of you wondering
[00:16:44] yeah so same one analogy it's true also
[00:16:48] the hyperloop short is also done I'm not
[00:16:50] going to spoil it but we have like a
[00:16:51] bunch of charts that are backlogged I
[00:16:53] just won't upload too much on my main
[00:16:54] channel so some shorts might be on the
[00:16:55] second Channel and
[00:16:58] I can't believe I'm saying this so
[00:16:59] please forgive me like don't get mad at
[00:17:01] me wait you guys can't see anything am I
[00:17:04] stupid press one if I'm stupid just
[00:17:06] press one if I'm stupid
[00:17:08] wait how could you guys not see that
[00:17:10] wait how what is yo I [ __ ] today I
[00:17:13] don't know what's happening
[00:17:18] am I like a sleepage what's that wait
[00:17:21] let me find it again
[00:17:22] I found it
[00:17:24] yeah I'll play it again I'm sorry
[00:17:26] I'll leak the shark like a toothbrush
[00:17:28] now farzan at C6 is like a fully
[00:17:31] functioning toothbrush you can brush
[00:17:32] your teeth and it's like wow I can't
[00:17:34] live without this but bars on c0 she's
[00:17:36] still good but she's like a toothpick
[00:17:39] with toothpaste on it it's better than
[00:17:41] using your finger but it's not as
[00:17:43] efficient as a toothbrush it's not even
[00:17:45] close so once you have the toothbrush
[00:17:46] you're like dude to the toothpick so
[00:17:49] that's the difference between c0 and C6
[00:17:51] bars on for those of you wondering true
[00:17:53] anyways so yeah now don't get mad at me
[00:17:56] guys don't get mad at me but since we do
[00:17:58] have an influx of shorts
[00:18:00] we might
[00:18:03] not me Alan who's my guy editor or short
[00:18:05] editor might start uploading them on
[00:18:07] Tick Tock but don't give out don't get
[00:18:09] mad at me listen listen we can save the
[00:18:11] platform I can be like the the
[00:18:17] I could be like the the gentian listen
[00:18:19] no no I can give you like a Renaissance
[00:18:22] era I give you like dude it's okay
[00:18:24] listen listen listen listen we listen we
[00:18:27] just we upload the same shorts to
[00:18:30] YouTube and Tick Tock so then there's
[00:18:31] like it's like oh wow we're basically
[00:18:33] making it better we're making making
[00:18:36] great like we're literally we're
[00:18:38] literally like call me like the
[00:18:41] who's someone who did good things
[00:18:43] who's like a nice person Chad maybe a
[00:18:46] nice person
[00:18:50] Drake okay that was not what I was
[00:18:54] looking
[00:18:57] what did more than one person say Drake
[00:18:58] what
[00:19:03] all right never mind analogy is uh
[00:19:06] [ __ ] I
[00:19:07] I'm gonna do it or not but we might try
[00:19:09] it see what happens
[00:19:11] see how the community is see if it's
[00:19:12] cool because I like everyone
[00:19:16] yeah I could be the
[00:19:22] land but I am the goat
[00:19:26] anyways
[00:19:28] so
[00:19:29] I'm sure everyone's like oh the
[00:19:31] community that's crazy but I'm sure like
[00:19:32] my community will be fine because dude
[00:19:34] I'm not like mean like I'm not like
[00:19:36] going being like your main sucks I'm
[00:19:39] just I'm just a goofy little goofball
[00:19:41] surely
[00:19:43] um
[00:19:45] so surely so I haven't decided if I'm
[00:19:47] gonna do it or not
[00:19:48] but in case I do I made an account
[00:19:51] because every name was taken so I have

[00:33:14] was a pyro Arrow but I thought it was
[00:33:16] like
[00:33:18] I'm not sure it's a troublemaker like I
[00:33:20] remember when like Clee and yumia had
[00:33:22] like an event together everyone was like
[00:33:24] oh [ __ ] it's over for everyone but I
[00:33:27] didn't like because fireworks and [ __ ]

[00:33:29] troublemaker
[00:33:33] okay wait I'm gonna plug my extension
[00:33:35] cable in so my head stopped pulling but
[00:33:37] for some reason it makes the audio weird
[00:33:39] so if I have to like adjust
[00:33:42] don't get mad at me
[00:33:52] you know the thing where like your
[00:33:54] headset only is in one ear like your
[00:33:56] earphones like only one ear works unless
[00:33:58] you plug it in at the perfect angle
[00:34:00] that's what my extension cable does it's
[00:34:02] fine right now but if I move too much it
[00:34:04] gets [ __ ] and I hate it it's like my
[00:34:06] biggest pet peeve but all good
[00:34:08] yeah so that's oh my God I just on
[00:34:13] it's fine
[00:34:15] this is a whole new world on Twitter so
[00:34:18] cute I haven't used Twitter I used it
[00:34:21] today but I've been using a while for
[00:34:22] two reasons one my phone battery
[00:34:25] imploded and my phone's like BR like
[00:34:27] relatively new and the battery just like
[00:34:30] kept dying so I took it to the Apple
[00:34:31] Store they fixed it for free so now I
[00:34:33] got it back but for a few days I didn't
[00:34:34] have it and then second of all they
[00:34:36] change it to X and it [ __ ] tilted me
[00:34:38] because it looks like a porn Tab and it
[00:34:40] actually why is it X it's X and it's
[00:34:42] called X and the logo is X and the the
[00:34:45] [ __ ] trait like the the the the the
[00:34:47] description or like the the thumbnail
[00:34:49] the tight what is it called the like
[00:34:51] catchphrase when you download is like
[00:34:52] Blaze on or some [ __ ] I don't [ __ ]
[00:34:55] know also I I didn't use it a bit
[00:34:57] recently I saw this person
[00:34:58] add signal impact make a exploration
[00:35:01] tier list very based I think exploration
[00:35:03] tier lists are what we need uh that
[00:35:05] they're actually probably the best tier
[00:35:06] lists gen have ever made I should make
[00:35:08] one of my own uh the only things that uh
[00:35:11] they failed to consider are that uh Daya
[00:35:13] allegedly she's not out and we don't
[00:35:15] cover leaks but allegedly she can tank
[00:35:17] uh dragonspine damage and also has an
[00:35:19] exploration passive but how would I know
[00:35:21] she's not out also visually pleasing but
[00:35:23] how would I know she's not out uh
[00:35:24] furthermore Kirara should be uh on the
[00:35:27] top tier because she can meow with no
[00:35:29] internal cooldown also is a box also can
[00:35:32] climb things also can move faster also
[00:35:34] has a shield so you're not getting
[00:35:35] [ __ ] left and right uh third Xiao
[00:35:37] should be uh top tier as well because
[00:35:39] while yeah you might be like dude scar
[00:35:41] is just like more comfy in the overall
[00:35:42] sure Xiao is so tall that sometimes you
[00:35:44] can like avoid like let's say there's
[00:35:46] like a dendroculum right right here and
[00:35:49] you're like this is ciao you're here
[00:35:50] like a normal character would be like
[00:35:52] this Xiao can just reach it like that
[00:35:53] and then he can like jump so the
[00:35:55] challenge is so tall and jumps a high
[00:35:56] that I would put him a bit higher the
[00:35:59] other characters for the most part
[00:36:01] for the most part you know uh you can
[00:36:03] agree uh you can agree
[00:36:06] um
[00:36:08] yeah
[00:36:16] also kokomi can walk on water and
[00:36:17] yaimiko can move faster because she can
[00:36:19] Dash forward with her right here also
[00:36:21] her right now lastly her emerge
[00:36:25] also baiju heals you when you pick up a
[00:36:27] flower
[00:36:28] so budget should be hired dude we should
[00:36:29] make our own tourists this is actually
[00:36:31] like the best this is the best type of
[00:36:32] tier list
[00:36:35] also Mika says
[00:36:37] Meek Mika of the Knights of fifonius so
[00:36:40] that should be moved up a tier
[00:36:51] yeah also doesn't Mika have a doesn't
[00:36:53] Mika have like a show material passive
[00:36:57] you don't even Explore though okay
[00:36:59] explain 100 a hundred a hundred a
[00:37:02] hundred a hundred a hundred a hundred a
[00:37:05] hundred a hundred a hundred oh guess
[00:37:07] what sumeru new region 100 100 188
[00:37:10] because we didn't do it yet 100 a
[00:37:12] hundred a hundred a hundred we ignore
[00:37:15] the desert because no one cares uh uh uh
[00:37:17] uh Yoshi Ori Island 100 uh grade Britain
[00:37:21] no we're not gonna look at that water
[00:37:22] City Island just came out the kokomi
[00:37:24] island came out to uh with kokomi Banner
[00:37:27] it came out three days ago we're
[00:37:28] starting to explore it right now we're
[00:37:30] gonna do it live
[00:37:31] true
[00:37:35] true
[00:37:39] okay can we all agree though
[00:37:41] unironically sumeru but other than the
[00:37:43] desert is by far the best region to
[00:37:45] explore it's not even close and if you
[00:37:46] disagree you're biased and you're like
[00:37:48] oh my God inazuma's pretty shut up it's
[00:37:50] true but literally dude literally you
[00:37:52] have like the you have like the four
[00:37:54] leaf clovers
[00:37:56] and then there's a bunch of like more
[00:37:58] [ __ ] to interact with and there's a
[00:37:59] bunch of quality of life and there's
[00:38:01] flowers that give you stamina and R r's

[00:49:13] pew pew pew
[00:49:19] Pew oh Izzy
[00:49:24] hello again are we done no we're not
[00:49:26] okay

[00:49:33] wins the twerk cops
[00:49:35] okay why were you asking that I hate
[00:49:37] them uh probably
[00:49:39] I lost my electric
[00:49:43] wait I have to Value where I'm supposed
[00:49:44] to go so I'm probably supposed to go
[00:49:45] there wait but how do I get there
[00:49:49] I see so then
[00:49:51] I see
[00:49:53] I see
[00:49:57] okay I see
[00:50:01] how are you supposed to do this without
[00:50:02] scarra because I could Scar and fly over
[00:50:04] there but there has to be a way without
[00:50:05] scars so it's probably like
[00:50:07] can I drop down and then fly
[00:50:10] no
[00:50:13] [ __ ] it
[00:50:30] what a cool dude when I was teaching him
[00:50:34] I thought of you Lena Cleveland
[00:50:38] I had a really great time even till no
[00:50:41] one asked dude it's just too easy it's
[00:50:44] so easy I can wait till the last second
[00:50:50] it's too easy this is too easy that's
[00:50:53] just too easy fresh
[00:50:58] easy pressure just
[00:51:05] now do it without scarra no just pull
[00:51:07] for scarra
[00:51:09] you probably okay without scar you
[00:51:10] probably have to like electrograde them
[00:51:12] so you probably have to go like there or
[00:51:13] some [ __ ] or like get that one yeah well
[00:51:15] that's great I think you go there
[00:51:19] probably
[00:51:22] yeah anyways
[00:51:27] what the [ __ ] is a Pepe W well you're
[00:51:30] about to see a lot of them if you can't
[00:51:32] see them get seven TV shows the Moats
[00:51:50] oh [ __ ] we got a blue Hangar that's
[00:51:52] actually rare than a five star
[00:51:54] s
[00:52:02] bro are you [ __ ]
[00:52:06] ha ha
[00:52:08] wings of dark
[00:52:12] everything
[00:52:14] was futile
[00:52:16] I was behind him I was literally behind
[00:52:20] him I walked behind him so I don't get
[00:52:22] hit why was his hitbox behind
[00:52:26] how does that even make sense
[00:52:31] dude how
[00:52:33] take it and have fun
[00:52:37] okay well at least we have a thousand
[00:52:39] resin
[00:52:44] you know [ __ ] you guys just because of
[00:52:46] that just because you're laughing at me
[00:52:47] I'm gonna make you watch me fish we're
[00:52:48] gonna go fishing
[00:52:54] fishing
[00:53:15] I used the wrong bait
[00:53:18] but I didn't
[00:53:19] but yes I did
[00:53:38] oh [ __ ]
[00:53:41] wait what's that oh yeah I forgot I
[00:53:42] forgot how the fishing works okay I got
[00:53:44] it now

[00:53:46] while

[00:54:06] Tomah
[00:54:08] wait what was that there when when the
[00:54:11] the catch first no because the catch was
[00:54:13] before Tomah right because you know
[00:54:14] Zuma's before Tom was like later right
[00:54:17] because when I fished that didn't happen
[00:54:21] Toma came out after the catch right
[00:54:24] no yeah I know I appreciate you did
[00:54:27] foreign

[00:54:39] yeah
[00:54:44] the toe was actually broken
[00:54:53] all right cool
[00:54:55] I don't know why I did that
[00:54:58] uh because we got a free 1000 voucher
[00:55:00] from a very notable uh for a figure uh
[00:55:03] we have a lot of resin to do I think
[00:55:04] we're gonna start on Asia server though

[00:55:07] come back to our main
[00:55:11] really fast though I need like two
[00:55:13] seconds

[00:55:51] I was thinking of making a short right

[00:56:04] Jeff hits me with a baguette and that's
[00:56:06] like a Fontan theme challenge true
[00:56:10] or not true
[00:56:20] all right let's swap accounts and then
[00:56:22] we'll come back to this one uh

[00:57:11] spending my fragile resident ar53 I have
[00:57:13] an attention spiral that yes
[00:57:15] yes level your talents then your weapons
[00:57:17] on the characters you want to use after
[00:57:19] you build two teams talents and weapons
[00:57:20] like at the same time and character
[00:57:22] level
[00:57:23] until like whatever level you need you
[00:57:24] don't have to get everything ID and then
[00:57:25] after that go on artifacts
[00:57:27] you're welcome
[00:57:31] [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:57:37] wait did Scott I missed that one
[00:57:39] bro
[00:57:52] great advice TBH okay let me let me give
[00:57:55] you the actual advice now submit to
[00:57:57] Vermillion just go over a million even
[00:57:58] if you don't have Xiao or ayato just go
[00:58:00] for a million and then and then see what
[00:58:01] happens after
[00:58:04] just do it just Vermilion you know you
[00:58:06] want to you know you want to get
[00:58:08] Vermillion think about it it gives you
[00:58:09] attack percent most characters can use
[00:58:11] attack percent
[00:58:14] like name me a character that that's not
[00:58:16] gonna use attack oh oh yeah long yolan
[00:58:19] can't use attack okay okay let's look at
[00:58:21] the Elon scalings
[00:58:24] oh oh if that isn't attack percent on
[00:58:28] her normal attacks so what if you're
[00:58:30] playing a physical yalon then you could
[00:58:33] go Vermillion why not Vermillion would
[00:58:34] work
[00:58:39] so there you go
[00:58:45] who Tau okay Yolanda actually has no
[00:58:47] attack skillings but hutao actually does
[00:58:51] who that literally has she's still
[00:58:53] charge tax which is attack yeah HP is
[00:58:55] better but she still has attack
[00:58:56] stealings so red Bozo even her burst
[00:59:01] yeah Rapunzel

[01:08:11] High punch Dodge
[01:08:14] foreign
[01:08:16] [Music]
[01:08:49] that was actually a challenge that's
[01:08:51] harder than Abyss
[01:08:53] oh we got three wait Chad welcome
[01:08:57] I know what just started dude we got
[01:08:59] three
[01:09:05] and there is in my playlist
[01:09:16] okay not a great start but we want
[01:09:17] emblem anyways not reminiscence oh
[01:09:19] that's good
[01:09:21] that's good no crew damage but ER yeah
[01:09:23] I'm not gonna be good we can use this on
[01:09:24] like
[01:09:25] even like changling or bet or something
[01:09:27] We're not gonna play but Beto it's good
[01:09:31] okay defense is useless but this could
[01:09:33] be good
[01:09:35] goblet no I'm lucky
[01:09:40] all right okay I mean not great but this
[01:09:42] is a good start
[01:09:44] dude keep in mind we're low AR so like
[01:09:47] having just good main stats is good do
[01:09:50] you just lock a purple okay why do you
[01:09:52] think my child's punching 18K we are on
[01:09:54] dude do you know what this account is
[01:09:56] our black lift poll is level 80. we
[01:09:58] don't even we're not even ar-50 dude
[01:10:00] like we can't we're literally broke it's
[01:10:02] not like it's a new account we're
[01:10:04] rebuilding
[01:10:08] this is like this is this is I mean my
[01:10:11] sound is actually good though for AR 46
[01:10:12] look at the sense unironically good look
[01:10:14] at this feather unironically good look
[01:10:16] at this Vermillion literally better than
[01:10:18] my main so now I have to farm for a
[01:10:19] million because we have one piece so we
[01:10:21] have to go for the second one it's like
[01:10:23] we curse this account
[01:10:25] we need the second million
[01:10:32] okay let me go uh heal my ah should I
[01:10:34] reviver I can't okay
[01:10:38] foreign
[01:10:43] yeah four stars are good especially for
[01:10:45] pieces like a flower or some [ __ ]
[01:10:49] early game it's like a lot cheaper
[01:10:55] okay but I should do I said I would do
[01:10:57] like bosses on this account and like
[01:10:58] Talent books
[01:11:02] but I could do that off stream and then
[01:11:04] Australia do the fun stuff so let's go
[01:11:05] do a quick Vermillion run let's just see
[01:11:06] what happens
[01:11:07] let's see what happens we might as well
[01:11:08] there's no downside I can't think of a
[01:11:10] downside honestly
[01:11:12] I can't really think of one honestly so
[01:11:14] we might as well
[01:11:23] you can't even use echoes in Asia okay
[01:11:25] true but I could use two piece because
[01:11:27] the two piece isn't ping dependent
[01:11:34] so we're playing Fishel in a
[01:11:36] non-aggravate team which means ER em is
[01:11:39] bad which means that we can go two
[01:11:41] Echoes on her anyone else agree I agree
[01:11:43] I agree
[01:11:53] oh my God zox is there ar-46 child
[01:11:56] punching for
[01:11:58] 17.18k yeah yeah no big deal
[01:12:00] laughs
[01:12:06] oh also I need to figure out how the
[01:12:08] [ __ ] I can get a blacksmith prototype
[01:12:10] for my Bennett because I need like the
[01:12:11] new one the Sumer one because I need a
[01:12:13] sapwood blade because right now my
[01:12:16] Bennett is on
[01:12:18] a level 60 festering desire R2 so
[01:12:23] all good
[01:12:28] worthless
[01:12:31] let's go
[01:12:34] no what the [ __ ]
[01:12:37] I forgot he did that attack I haven't
[01:12:39] seen that attack at like over a hundred
[01:12:41] [ __ ] runs I actually forgot he did
[01:12:44] that
[01:12:55] maybe when he does that spin you get
[01:12:57] good artifact lock maybe that's why my
[01:12:59] luck's bad on my main because I cleared
[01:13:00] too fast he doesn't get the spin and
[01:13:02] maybe he just wants to spin like that's
[01:13:03] what he wants to do
[01:13:05] so why would he give me a good artifact
[01:13:06] if I don't let him spin
[01:13:17] yeah
[01:13:21] what did I miss are you okay
[01:13:25] why are you back here because this is an
[01:13:26] efficient account we're being efficient
[01:13:28] on this account
[01:13:29] so anything we do here has to be
[01:13:31] efficient and since our child already
[01:13:33] has one Vermilion piece if we get
[01:13:35] another one technically it's efficient
[01:13:39] four-star is fine
[01:14:06] um
[01:14:11] wait you can't even be anti-vermillion
[01:14:34] foreign
[01:15:00] can't think of a username
[01:15:12] yeah [ __ ] it whatever
[01:15:14] I give up okay let's uh let's do one
[01:15:17] more run of uh we'll do emblem actually
[01:15:19] should I do I should probably do Talent
[01:15:20] books but that's not fun we'll dump them
[01:15:22] might as well do other [ __ ] off stream
[01:15:24] uh
[01:15:33] demons do not stop for the rain
[01:15:36] demons do not stop for the rain thanks
[01:15:39] trial
[01:15:41] thanks man
[01:15:46] we ain't making it past 410 with this
[01:15:48] account I'm actually going to show you
[01:15:49] guys how fast this transformed we're
[01:15:50] gonna have an epic YouTube video with a
[01:15:52] dramatic storytelling to see the
[01:15:55] efficiency and the destruction that is
[01:15:57] this account
[01:15:58] how I transformed a cursed account into
[01:16:00] a thing of beauty
[01:16:03] so beautiful that Harvard wants to know
[01:16:05] my location
[01:16:13] attack by jumping oh my Dodge float in
[01:16:15] the air oh my God how are you like the
[01:16:17] best chow mein it's actually insane how
[01:16:19] you can dodge things just instinctually
[01:16:29] hamster huh
[01:16:31] hello comeemos what are you doing I'm
[01:16:33] building this our free to play account
[01:16:34] we're being efficient
[01:16:43] okay good damage good damage
[01:16:57] go actually not bad
[01:17:02] ah what's this
[01:17:10] pulse trap
[01:17:15] on one hand this looks bad on the other
[01:17:17] hand we're ar-46 so we're gonna give it
[01:17:21] actually it's probably worth strong
[01:17:22] boxing that I don't think it's actually
[01:17:24] worth leveling compared to just strong
[01:17:25] boxing it
[01:17:33] why is your Asian shell better than your
[01:17:34] na Chao it's not
[01:17:36] my NHL is better this this account is 90
[01:17:39] 90 130. oh ironically not bad we just
[01:17:43] need more crit damage
[01:17:45] but we could probably go a crit damage
[01:17:47] Circle it what if we do like this
[01:17:50] no because then we lose the Berserker
[01:17:51] two piece no no wait do I have a
[01:17:53] Berserker criter one wait let's see
[01:17:56] if I have Berserker damage I might use
[01:17:58] it oh I do
[01:18:00] should I use this chat
[01:18:04] yo berserker's gonna crack though
[01:18:06] berserk is kind of different do I have a
[01:18:08] Vermillion oh we need Vermillion because
[01:18:11] I have one piece per million if we get
[01:18:12] another Vermillion we could go two piece
[01:18:15] I think what we need is a Vermilion
[01:18:17] circuit
[01:18:18] I think all we need is Vermillion chat
[01:18:20] I'm being honest why would I lie I'm
[01:18:22] being honest I think we need Vermillion

[01:34:56] scuffed setup we'll do it like right
[01:34:57] here
[01:34:59] is the lighting too loud
[01:35:08] you should turn on unique chat for uid
[01:35:10] reviews

[01:35:13] we could also turn on like
[01:35:20] we could turn on like a timer for
[01:35:22] messages but that's kind of ass
[01:35:23] thought I need to chat
[01:35:29] we could slow mode

[01:46:01] multiple characters it's a good addition
[01:46:03] to your account it gives you crit damage
[01:46:06] you know there's like a there's a theory
[01:46:08] but in practice
[01:46:12] not only can you not Dash cancel or Dash
[01:46:15] around but you also have to run a shield
[01:46:17] to use your stamina offensively with a
[01:46:20] Caesar Hotel

[01:46:48] oh
[01:46:51] wait this is really good you just need
[01:46:52] more em so maybe like obviously your
[01:46:54] thought was good enough to clear
[01:46:55] anything you don't need to what the [ __ ]
[01:46:57] never mind never mind I was gonna say
[01:46:59] you just need em you clearly you need

[01:47:02] happening see if you hey
[01:47:05] I I don't even wanna if you had a
[01:47:07] criterate weapon no actually almost bet
[01:47:09] just go Korean Circle it just go and
[01:47:12] curve in circuit if you had a crude rate
[01:47:14] Circle it your problems would be solved
[01:47:15] maybe a curry circle with like a little
[01:47:17] bit yeah I'm like 60. boom suddenly you
[01:47:19] have enough em and you have a good ratio
[01:47:26] that's not good without though
[01:47:28] investment wise triple crowned wait are
[01:47:31] you actually free to play catch
[01:47:32] stringless

[01:48:12] we'll see one
[01:48:15] double crowned okay
[01:48:16] his normal attacks are actually very
[01:48:18] important by the way so you might as
[01:48:19] well Crown this but you're all good
[01:48:24] 83 161 with a lot of yam on a non-uh
[01:48:27] crew weapon so that's actually pretty
[01:48:28] good let's look at your ratio are your
[01:48:30] pieces that's a good circuit
[01:48:32] that is a [ __ ] insane goblet
[01:48:40] [ __ ] you for not using this on a dendro
[01:48:42] character but it's very good
[01:48:47] unlucky
[01:48:49] dumb okay your friend is your worst
[01:48:51] piece but everything else is [ __ ]
[01:48:52] insane this is insane that's actually
[01:48:54] really good huh good [ __ ] good
[01:48:59] also your uh four characters is a very
[01:49:01] uh tall male team
[01:49:04] let's just say they have a type
[01:49:09] what is this all right I'll look for
[01:49:10] I'll let chat catch up
[01:49:14] oh wait I saw a lumine best dendro
[01:49:18] lumine yo I haven't seen a lumine flex
[01:49:20] ever this better be lit
[01:49:22] ar55 Abyss 10 3 all good all good all
[01:49:25] good all good 10.
[01:49:27] light enough why isn't this okay first
[01:49:30] of all what the [ __ ] is happening second
[01:49:32] of all why isn't this level 90
[01:49:35] um
[01:49:37] third of all level your [ __ ] talents
[01:49:40] this looks like placeholder I'll hide
[01:49:42] them this looks like you just lost the
[01:49:45] 50 50 on a heighten so out of spite you
[01:49:47] built your [ __ ] the mean
[01:49:49] what is happening
[01:49:52] all right someone else
[01:50:01] best DPS venti in Australia all right
[01:50:03] let's look at it oh Australia review one
[01:50:05] sec
[01:50:06] Australia review let's just uh do that
[01:50:09] all right
[01:50:10] Australian venti let's look at this
[01:50:14] Skyward heart that's good are you
[01:50:16] credential well right away I see Zero em
[01:50:18] so uh this is looking problematic but it
[01:50:21] could still be good you know I like crit
[01:50:24] venti with for example farzan and
[01:50:25] Bennett you're like big investment you
[01:50:27] got a lot of attack I I can see that
[01:50:29] working so maybe that's what you're
[01:50:30] playing C3 actually not bad Triple Crown
[01:50:34] okay so I got it
[01:50:37] that's really good this looks like a
[01:50:38] shell build I'm not gonna lie okay
[01:50:41] that's good
[01:50:42] uh [ __ ] you but that's insane why am I
[01:50:44] being mean why can't I just be like
[01:50:46] congrats man
[01:50:47] that's pretty good uh maidens but all
[01:50:49] good
[01:50:52] yeah pretty decent Curry is a bit low
[01:50:54] but pretty decent why is the upside down
[01:50:56] because this is an Australian Venti
[01:51:00] all right next one
[01:51:11] non-toxic yoy Mia are you implying other
[01:51:14] yomias are toxic I love you Amia let's
[01:51:16] look at this okay non-toxic give me up
[01:51:18] so they have rust R5
[01:51:21] triple crowned
[01:51:24] portion okay that's good
[01:51:27] that is insane
[01:51:28] that is also insane
[01:51:32] oh my God
[01:51:34] oh my God oh my God sorry yeah I don't
[01:51:38] know why I went insane but actually good
[01:51:40] this is a good commercial especially
[01:51:41] because you don't have a crit weapon so
[01:51:42] it's like
[01:51:44] pretty impressive good job
[01:51:45] wait let's look at a random character
[01:51:47] kooky [ __ ] it
[01:51:48] key
[01:51:50] I mean it's good for cookie but why
[01:51:59] okay I'm gonna say it she right now is
[01:52:02] pretty good because we don't have any HP
[01:52:03] swords right but fonten and I don't talk
[01:52:06] about leaks okay but Fontan will release
[01:52:08] a baguette craftable or bakeable uh a
[01:52:12] bakeable okay font Ed will release a
[01:52:14] bakeable
[01:52:15] HP sword you go to the blacksmith but
[01:52:18] it's actually a baker he bakes you a
[01:52:20] baguette that scales it gives you HP so

[01:53:57] foreign

[01:54:09] car and it's on set
[01:54:12] 98.99 wise 98 198. hello

[01:54:20] many noises
[01:54:22] I'm just asking like I'm not complaining
[01:54:24] I'm just asking
[01:54:42] best child I sped everything on him okay
[01:54:44] we'll do a child review
[01:54:47] all right child level 90 Polar Star to
[01:54:52] four hard adapts and Triple Crown now I
[01:54:55] know you said you sped everything on
[01:54:56] child disclaimer when you're building
[01:54:58] child you can go like literally any two
[01:55:00] people like any offensive two-piece
[01:55:02] so you don't actually need to farm hard
[01:55:04] to death pass just like the 2p set uh do
[01:55:07] you have an off-piece in a blast so it
[01:55:09] could arguably be better to go to Nobles
[01:55:11] to her death than office the rest
[01:55:13] but we'll look at your stats flower
[01:55:15] that was really good that also really
[01:55:18] good sads

[01:55:25] wait okay the test of a child though I
[01:55:26] was the test of a child is if you can
[01:55:30] because there has been a An Occurrence
[01:55:32] of child means not being able to crit
[01:55:34] but you have Polar Star so I assume you
[01:55:36] have enough crit rate
[01:55:37] not bad
[01:55:38] good job good job almost a good child
[01:55:47] all right this is a Sino let's look at

[01:57:54] it's disrespectful to not just Joy Mia
[01:57:57] Mains not just Joy Mia herself but it's
[01:58:00] disrespectful to all of the Ina zoomens
[01:58:02] you are collecting
[01:58:03] they deserve the ideal damage that's
[01:58:06] what they deserve if you love a
[01:58:08] character you build them she's unable
[01:58:20] wait what's the difference between Amos
[01:58:21] and slingshot let me look this up
[01:58:23] okay Mia what kqm I forgot that wait let
[01:58:28] me look at this

[01:58:46] and then it doesn't even show [ __ ]
[01:58:48] Amos oh it's here wait
[01:58:50] wait
[01:58:51] okay
[01:58:52] Amos is worse than slingshot no I get it
[01:58:55] okay slingshot isn't very visually
[01:58:57] pleasing
[01:58:59] but slingshot is sling the the R5 3 star
[01:59:02] weapon is literally better than Amos
[01:59:09] you might be able to use Amos on someone
[01:59:10] else if you collect Inazuma characters
[01:59:12] uh
[01:59:15] wait is there an Inazuma bow that could
[01:59:17] use Amos I mean technically Sarah is
[01:59:19] high base attack
[01:59:22] must not even that high but
[01:59:26] yeah I guess only Sarah right charge
[01:59:29] shot you'll be a true
[01:59:32] sorrow wants ER but you can like make a
[01:59:35] case for a high base attack if you have
[01:59:37] enough
[01:59:42] all right next one real kokomi mane and
[01:59:44] that's what I like to see
[01:59:51] foreign
[01:59:55] stop it how many times I have to tell
[01:59:57] you kokomi does not support spending for
[02:00:00] her donut she is not a big donut enjoyer
[02:00:06] if you love kokomi you read her
[02:00:08] thrilling Tales to bed okay that's what
[02:00:11] if you love kokomi you reach she likes
[02:00:14] to read thrilling Tales she enjoys it
[02:00:15] she likes stories I like stories
[02:00:20] but it's based if you like your mirror
[02:00:22] and you think it's pretty and it matches
[02:00:23] her and you want to use it I respect it
[02:00:25] but I will judge you for it Triple Crown
[02:00:27] that's based C1 that's based four clamos
[02:00:30] look at it
[02:00:32] that's a lot of HP a lot of attacks some
[02:00:33] Er very good uh I mean as you are at HP
[02:00:37] it's fine it's fine it's not like the
[02:00:38] strongest piece but ER is fine HP says
[02:00:41] some Er 11 crit rate that is uh
[02:00:44] kind of wasted but all good
[02:00:47] that is that is
[02:00:50] looking at kokomi pieces is hard because
[02:00:52] I don't know what I'm looking for but I
[02:00:53] see some some I mean it's okay uh this
[02:00:57] is really good a lot of HP
[02:01:00] minus 83.55 pretty good pretty good call
[02:01:04] me respectful respectful I mean wait
[02:01:06] let's look at your nilu wait you have
[02:01:07] set your key right yeah

[02:01:44] an old player how do you not have Hotel
[02:01:46] your ar-60 just pull for hutao
[02:01:49] even if you're free to play you can save
[02:01:51] primo jobs you've been playing for three
[02:01:53] years
[02:01:54] all good all good maybe you got unlucky
[02:01:56] it happens
[02:01:57] okay go call me
[02:02:00] let's talk about kitchen all right Miss
[02:02:02] splitter 433 that's good c0 not even
[02:02:06] ground Pokemon I respect that but
[02:02:08] chronic all right let's look at this
[02:02:10] that's good
[02:02:12] also I mean it's decent yeah it's pretty
[02:02:14] good what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
[02:02:21] yo what
[02:02:27] is it saying
[02:02:29] um I will say
[02:02:34] em says it's about us well you have a
[02:02:36] high visnag weapon yeah I mean just gone
[02:02:38] yeah no this is too good keep it yeah
[02:02:40] that's too good you probably want some
[02:02:41] yam substance though you have [ __ ] 42
[02:02:42] but it still really good so far it's
[02:02:44] also really good Circle it
[02:02:46] [Music]
[02:02:48] edible build why'd I say edible
[02:02:50] because it's like tasty like I the more
[02:02:52] crit the tastier the build true that's
[02:02:55] good you also get some crit rate with
[02:02:56] your pasta palette your when you burst
[02:02:58] so it's actually more correct than it
[02:02:59] seems
[02:03:00] so it's actually good
[02:03:03] drinks 15 and got his 20 crit rate right
[02:03:10] check ayakan oppa sure
[02:03:15] ayaka and Oppa we'll start with oppa all
[02:03:18] right you have the catch you have four
[02:03:20] emblem you have C5 goba mad
[02:03:23] please you can't go by I [ __ ] respect
[02:03:25] that uh
[02:03:27] it's pretty good but keep in mind crafts
[02:03:29] using more crit rates you might want to
[02:03:30] be more damage but
[02:03:31] wait that's a lot of yeah what the [ __ ]
[02:03:33] yeah I'm says I see
[02:03:35] I see
[02:03:37] I see
[02:03:39] wait it's actually really good what the
[02:03:40] hell wait this is insane yeah you
[02:03:42] probably want a bit more crit damage
[02:03:43] instead of crit rate so if some of your
[02:03:45] like pieces can give you a little bit
[02:03:47] more damage but these pieces are all
[02:03:49] insane so yeah no complaints here that's
[02:03:51] a really good shiny thing what about
[02:03:52] your ayaka ICA 2000 attack Miss splitter
[02:03:57] um honestly kind of low attack but if
[02:04:00] your crib makes up for it that's fine 26
[02:04:03] that's pretty good that's pretty good
[02:04:05] good yeah you're very low on attack but
[02:04:09] yeah like at this point even attack
[02:04:10] circuit could be better depending on
[02:04:11] your sub stats and like here are the
[02:04:13] subs that's like they're kind of I mean
[02:04:14] ER is nice but yeah you might want
[02:04:17] either an attack circuit or more attacks
[02:04:18] on stats because when your crew damage
[02:04:20] is like starting to pass 260 and [ __ ]
[02:04:22] attack can be more valuable but it's a
[02:04:24] good I go are you crowned you are nice
[02:04:27] they have shanha yeah it depends on your
[02:04:29] team but also they have missed Splitters
[02:04:31] so it's just a subside thing
[02:04:33] but you can always use the optimizer
[02:04:35] so I'm gonna trust that you did that and
[02:04:37] your Ike is good
[02:04:46] amazing ayato
[02:04:48] hey okay
[02:04:50] let's check your eyes out
[02:04:52] your name is I love child but you don't
[02:04:54] even have child you have ayato
[02:04:58] what is this where is your [ __ ]
[02:05:00] tartaglia
[02:05:02] KJ cutter
[02:05:09] wait what okay this is the first offset
[02:05:12] husk piece I have ever seen why is it
[02:05:16] this good
[02:05:22] offset maidens
[02:05:24] you never mind
[02:05:28] that's pretty good I mean it's okay this
[02:05:30] is really good but your stuff is decent
[02:05:32] it's okay 62 defense rip Bozo but it's
[02:05:34] fine this is really good
[02:05:38] oh that's good
[02:05:40] yeah your Sans flower and uh goblet are
[02:05:42] really good the other two pieces you can
[02:05:43] give or take but foreign
[02:05:59] surely you could just I my voice drowns
[02:06:02] out the voices in your head best Julie
[02:06:05] you'll ever see okay let's see
[02:06:09] level 84 Abyss 11 3 I'm guessing this
[02:06:13] Eula has 62 crit rate
[02:06:21] uh why is your weapon level 60 . I
[02:06:28] okay you crowned her so clearly you like
[02:06:30] her so let me give you actual advice I'm
[02:06:32] not just gonna meme okay if you actually
[02:06:34] like her level your [ __ ] weapon what
[02:06:35] the hell level it
[02:06:38] is good but if you need the ER which
[02:06:40] yeah so just which is like you know so
[02:06:43] leveler
[02:06:44] I mean level the weapon
[02:06:47] that's really good
[02:06:48] that's really good
[02:06:50] that's pretty decent
[02:07:03] yeah you want some more crude raid uh
[02:07:05] maybe do something like
[02:07:10] yeah if they want more crit your pale
[02:07:13] flame is good you could arguably so if
[02:07:15] you have an offset goblet you can do
[02:07:16] offset goblet and then
[02:07:19] um even if you don't have a pill in
[02:07:20] circuit you do just two beasts like to
[02:07:22] be spelled I'm too Bloodstone or some
[02:07:23] [ __ ] if you get more crit rate from it
[02:07:25] because I mean attack's good but you
[02:07:27] have like no [ __ ] crit rate I mean I
[02:07:28] guess you could just Spam reset whatever
[02:07:29] sure
[02:07:31] what does your child look like
[02:07:34] okay what do you have a phobia of level
[02:07:36] 90
[02:07:37] why are your weapons
[02:07:43] okay which doesn't make sense but these
[02:07:46] are arguably the two least important
[02:07:48] weapons of your account to upgrade to
[02:07:49] 90. other than maybe it's fine
[02:07:53] what did level your [ __ ] weapons
[02:07:56] okay next account
[02:08:05] a Nemo boys harem
[02:08:07] what does that word mean it just makes
[02:08:09] me think of Haram
[02:08:12] animal boys Haram
[02:08:14] okay let's look at this ciao Jay spear
[02:08:18] uh TV video
[02:08:22] that's good
[02:08:25] that's good actually I did yeah yeah
[02:08:26] yeah you have attacked you know it's
[02:08:28] good Charlotte's attack
[02:08:30] not as much as he likes me
[02:08:33] I'm gonna this is disrespectful to Xiao
[02:08:35] so I'm gonna pretend to see it God was
[02:08:37] pretty good though
[02:08:39] sir that's good but it's not good enough
[02:08:41] to be an off piece like yeah attack's
[02:08:42] good yeah but yours your Sans honestly
[02:08:44] sucks balls so you might as well go a
[02:08:46] glad like if you have a glad circuit or
[02:08:47] like another uh like you can even use
[02:08:49] this as an off piece because it's pretty
[02:08:51] good so you could do like 2v2
[02:08:53] reminiscence two Echoes to Vermillion to
[02:08:55] [ __ ] desert pavio to [ __ ] I don't
[02:08:59] know husk to be tanky and then you get
[02:09:01] C4 Shao don't do that but it would be
[02:09:02] funny
[02:09:04] [ __ ] it go call me review
[02:09:07] okay based

[02:09:48] a generic attack percent sets I am
[02:09:50] expecting the most insane sub stats
[02:09:52] otherwise why are you on two pcvs
[02:09:55] instead of like

[02:10:17] gonna guess 82 201
[02:10:21] 0 yeah pretty much you have zero em but
[02:10:23] you're probably just

[02:14:02] hydrate
[02:14:19] best Xiao in a one centimeter radius of
[02:14:22] my PC aware
[02:14:25] foreign
[02:14:37] also respectable however it shows that
[02:14:39] you tried to farm for Vermilion which
[02:14:41] means you have behaved badly
[02:14:44] double crowned I respect it let's look
[02:14:46] that's good
[02:14:52] this is uh that's pretty insane
[02:14:57] okay let's look at your goblet
[02:15:00] oh what's the top I mean okay this is
[02:15:02] insane but it's attack I got baited I
[02:15:03] thought it was a Nemo still good Xiao
[02:15:05] can still use it to attack goblet
[02:15:06] especially if you're not on four
[02:15:07] Vermillion but it's still an arm a
[02:15:10] lowercase arm it's not like a big Omega
[02:15:11] it's a small arm but this crit Valley is
[02:15:13] insane yeah so it is still really good
[02:15:15] because you can go attack uh goblet
[02:15:18] it's still fine
[02:15:20] circuit
[02:15:21] that's really good
[02:15:23] also really good yeah it's a good
[02:15:24] Channel
[02:15:25] good
[02:15:28] 15.
[02:15:31] wait where the
[02:15:41] two recent all right next one wait
[02:15:43] actually
[02:15:54] trying to see if there's anyone in the
[02:15:56] friend request that's worth reviewing
[02:15:57] that looks interesting
[02:16:02] this person calls right in ball I
[02:16:04] haven't done that for like two years
[02:16:06] since before she came out so I assume
[02:16:08] they don't play anymore they have 344
[02:16:10] achievements let's see what their ball
[02:16:11] looks like
[02:16:12] R3 catch
[02:16:16] I mean that's actually not it's actually
[02:16:19] good what the f what the [ __ ]
[02:16:21] wait how did it wait
[02:16:24] how is the right and low key better than
[02:16:26] mine and they're like AR [ __ ] okay
[02:16:28] well I lost it okay what the hell
[02:16:31] oh
[02:16:32] okay next one
[02:16:35] wait gangu's online
[02:16:38] you think he's in chat
[02:16:40] level 80 shingling
[02:16:43] wait what does Gandhi's child look like
[02:16:47] wait why are you up
[02:16:50] why do you want to go this is one of my
[02:16:51] mods
[02:16:54] wait I actually came up with this build
[02:16:56] never mind this is based never mind I
[02:16:58] came up with I actually talked about
[02:16:59] this it's actually based it's based
[02:17:00] because you get 50 okay here man you got
[02:17:03] 50 normal charge and punch attack damage
[02:17:05] and Shout us both when you use your
[02:17:07] skill and you get 18 attack okay so
[02:17:09] doesn't that sound like best slot but
[02:17:11] you lose some energy so that sucks
[02:17:12] however if you run enable supports and
[02:17:15] the engulfing lightning not only do you
[02:17:16] have enough energy but also a decently
[02:17:18] High base attack and you also get your
[02:17:20] energy converted into attack uh sorry
[02:17:23] assistant yeah you get energy converters
[02:17:25] attack but also you get energy recharge
[02:17:27] when you use reverse so any flying
[02:17:28] particles that come to you you can gain
[02:17:30] more of
[02:17:36] you're not crowned minus one point nine
[02:17:39] out of ten
[02:17:40] gling if you're checking this crowd I'm
[02:17:42] unmody okay good you should Crown go

[02:18:11] beta in a while
[02:18:13] all right a beta build let's see
[02:18:18] okay you
[02:18:19] before I even review your beta you're a
[02:18:22] Eula profile picture with a Eula Banner

[02:18:26] description is achoo
[02:18:28] like the sneeze

[02:18:49] her burst Skyward Pride not bad if you
[02:18:52] need the ER we'll see if you do flower
[02:18:54] that's pretty good
[02:18:57] you ready
[02:18:58] wait that's insane
[02:19:00] you're already approaching the maybe has
[02:19:02] too much ER range
[02:19:06] tactics I'm always ready pretty good
[02:19:09] I don't know if you need 187 er uh maybe
[02:19:12] if you're playing like solo Electro
[02:19:14] but
[02:19:16] yeah depends on your team
[02:19:19] let's see how I look like what the [ __ ]
[02:19:21] girls
[02:19:25] wait wait
[02:19:28] ew
[02:19:31] ew we have senses better on yeah
[02:19:33] generally especially with aggravate now
[02:19:35] like aggravate or hypers or whatever
[02:19:37] yeah but
[02:19:40] um it's really good
[02:19:47] all right next one
[02:19:49] look at my baiju
[02:19:52] how do you even look at a baiju what
[02:19:53] what is this what you have like a lot of
[02:19:55] HP let's look at it looks like you we'll
[02:19:57] see if it's impressive 49.9 K prototype
[02:20:00] Amber
[02:20:02] uh
[02:20:03] uh why do you have 20 different
[02:20:12] afar's on okay let's look at a farzan
[02:20:15] what's up the first one build
[02:20:17] okay and a Nemo enjoyer I respect that
[02:20:21] five orbo that's the needed weapon
[02:20:23] affordables is fine are you C6 you are
[02:20:26] at C6 I usually recommend uh Tennessee
[02:20:29] the middle but maybe you have that on
[02:20:31] like
[02:20:36] never mind uh okay let's look at it
[02:20:40] yeah
[02:20:42] that's a lot of ER
[02:20:44] that's a lot of ER
[02:20:46] yep
[02:20:48] that's that's the defense goblet and
[02:20:51] crittery with a lot of oh my wait this
[02:20:52] is insane for five thumb
[02:20:55] okay I'm gonna be honest if you were a c
[02:20:58] zero I'd be like okay keep working on it
[02:21:00] maybe you need a bit more ER but at C6
[02:21:02] you're probably Overkill
[02:21:04] um because you are C6 but hey I respect
[02:21:07] it
[02:21:10] why tenacity better at C6 it's not
[02:21:12] necessarily better than the blast it's
[02:21:13] just
[02:21:14] a lot of characters can use the blast
[02:21:15] not that many can use middle lift and
[02:21:17] farzan can use millets unless she's C6
[02:21:19] at C6 I can't click on it because it's
[02:21:21] not my account at C6 farzan's burst
[02:21:26] and then every like 2.5 seconds or
[02:21:27] something or I don't know how many
[02:21:28] seconds every 50 seconds it uses her
[02:21:32] skill inside of reverse it'll just
[02:21:33] passive easier skill so that skill proc
[02:21:35] Will Group enemies give you energy and
[02:21:39] counter skill damage so Millet will buff
[02:21:41] your uh party members
[02:21:46] best hotel in the Philippines okay this
[02:21:48] is those are fighting words because I
[02:21:50] have a lot of Filipino viewers so if
[02:21:52] this isn't actually the best to tell
[02:21:53] from there uh you will get roasted
[02:21:56] and banished so good luck 275 am with 32
[02:22:00] khp off to a good start staff at home

[02:22:43] every day for the last two years
[02:22:45] meanwhile me I have to do for a million
[02:22:47] just because just because I'm envious of
[02:22:49] you being able to [ __ ] play emblem on
[02:22:51] the characters even your yeah
[02:22:54] if if your out heightam has either ammo
[02:22:56] or Evanescence I'm ending the stream
[02:22:57] okay thank God
[02:22:59] I'm rolling the dice because I'm I'm

[02:23:34] obviously at this point Curry is better
[02:23:36] than her damage but it's really hard to
[02:23:37] get a lot of crit rate on Hotel because
[02:23:39] Homa gets good damage and her Ascension
[02:23:40] gets good damage so it's hard to balance
[02:23:42] it but still really [ __ ] good a lot

[02:26:03] fine just because he's asked nicely and
[02:26:06] said please
[02:26:07] let's get out of them level 90.
[02:26:10] yeah he looks good
[02:26:14] good yeah higher proof
[02:26:17] all right weapon Freedom sworn that's
[02:26:19] respectable dreams was fine on him like
[02:26:21] I'd rather use it on someone else but
[02:26:23] it's still good around because he can
[02:26:24] make use of the em and the effect so
[02:26:25] it's still good uh four gilded dreams
[02:26:28] double crowned
[02:26:30] let's look at it flower
[02:26:33] what the [ __ ]
[02:26:36] okay you already know if your land rules
[02:26:38] of six I have never seen you in chat
[02:26:40] again I hope she doesn't so that you are
[02:26:42] not bad I I hope I I don't want a viewer
[02:26:44] to be bad I hope Elon rolls like a two
[02:26:47] but if she does roll a six I'm sorry
[02:27:07] [ __ ] I thought that was six all right
[02:27:09] let's keep looking here uh I'll hit them
[02:27:11] all right so this far is insane
[02:27:13] this feather is uh really good like
[02:27:15] pretty good because all the rolls are
[02:27:17] good but it's not as good as this one
[02:27:18] but still pretty good
[02:27:19] that's really good
[02:27:21] goblet
[02:27:28] it's okay
[02:27:30] it's really good too
[02:27:31] what does the ratio look like 62 158
[02:27:33] with a lot of yam you can use a bit more
[02:27:35] crate but any on like no ER what the
[02:27:38] [ __ ]
[02:27:40] you probably want a little bit more yarn
[02:27:41] you don't need that much if you're like
[02:27:42] spamming Quicken and you have like a
[02:27:43] Heat official or something but
[02:27:46] you do want a bit more
[02:27:49] uh if I were you I would probably
[02:27:54] yeah I mean a lot of your pieces are
[02:27:55] good it's kind of hard to upgrade maybe
[02:27:56] your feather although these like these
[02:27:58] rules are really good but you might want
[02:28:00] like some Er and crit rate but yeah
[02:28:03] what's their Cosmo's weapon
[02:28:08] wait just go Fab I'll hide them
[02:28:22] once I got to reset my thing
[02:28:30] foreign
[02:28:34] goblet
[02:28:39] okay now typically people that only ask
[02:28:41] to look at one piece is a flex so what
[02:28:43] we're gonna do is we'll look at your
[02:28:44] goblet
[02:28:45] oh that is very nice
[02:28:53] but now we're gonna look at some other
[02:28:54] pieces look at your sinus goblet surely
[02:28:58] surely your eye cause goblet won't be
[02:29:00] surely your shells goblet will be a week
[02:29:05] all right man you're just a goblet
[02:29:06] guzzler you're just a goblet God I'm
[02:29:09] sorry I'm sorry for [ __ ] doubting
[02:29:10] your goblets I'm sorry I'm sorry man I'm
[02:29:12] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:29:16] I'm sorry why did I even check
[02:29:28] Ed out 100.
[02:29:30] what's up
[02:29:32] why do you always have more crit rate
[02:29:34] than ER why is your crew rate almost
[02:29:36] higher than your ER
[02:29:39] that shouldn't happen
[02:29:53] should replace shimanawa hutau if you're
[02:29:56] shimanawa and C zero you can no longer
[02:29:59] have fun playing engine impact I so I'm
[02:30:02] hoping
[02:30:05] so not only do you have no energy
[02:30:09] no Primo gems
[02:30:11] but you also have no [ __ ] energy wait
[02:30:14] did I say seven or energy first
[02:30:16] whatever no energy no stamina
[02:30:20] and no homo
[02:30:26] so good let's look at your build
[02:30:29] that's good
[02:30:32] that's pretty good you have HP ER is not
[02:30:34] really needed but the rest I mean
[02:30:35] actually it kind of is with reminiscence
[02:30:36] you can use a bit it's fine that's good
[02:30:40] what is this
[02:30:44] and it's on emblem so you could also use
[02:30:46] it for like yalon
[02:30:49] Pepe w
[02:30:56] foreign
[02:31:03] that's good now I'm gonna just be nice
[02:31:05] and say that's good
[02:31:07] because life is already hard at c0 with
[02:31:10] four piece reminiscence
[02:31:12] so

[02:50:43] day resets because it is 4 20 and I
[02:50:45] still haven't spent any resin on my name

[02:50:50] it's all the counts
[02:51:01] um turn someone off now
[02:51:04] poggies
[02:51:07] wait I saw the mode that I wanted to add
[02:51:10] I think I added it in fength stream but
[02:51:11] I didn't add it in mind I don't remember
[02:51:12] what it was
[02:51:13] oh it was phones
[02:51:16] wait did I add it
[02:51:20] look at this sponge sponge
[02:51:24] did it so good that's like half of you
[02:51:27] right now Chad it's literally half of
[02:51:28] you
[02:51:30] Let me refresh chat so I can see it
[02:51:36] phone just so good
[02:51:43] what happened to say he joined some like
[02:51:45] big editing agency thing or like some
[02:51:47] film project I know he tried something
[02:51:49] pretty cool in the Philippines so to
[02:51:51] force a conversation it was very talk
[02:51:53] for him by silence
[02:51:55] he's a giga Chad
[02:52:00] so right now I'm like figuring the
[02:52:01] editing situation we have a lot of like
[02:52:03] I've been trialing like four editors and
[02:52:04] they're all super talented or three plus
[02:52:06] Mirai for the second Channel
[02:52:09] um and they're all really talented
[02:52:11] so I'll like go through them with you
[02:52:13] guys once it's like established but for
[02:52:15] now we're just gonna doing that for guys
[02:52:16] I still added a big part of it but Alan
[02:52:18] helps out with like the bass and then I
[02:52:19] have to like go over and [ __ ] which is
[02:52:21] why it takes so long to upload guys uh
[02:52:23] and he works on shorts too which is POG
[02:52:25] and Mirai if you guys don't know we
[02:52:27] [ __ ] yoinked I just tell it like it
[02:52:29] is
[02:52:30] someone can't handle it Mariah we
[02:52:33] literally joined to use some exhaust
[02:52:34] Clips compilations I was like DJ editing
[02:52:35] sick no we yanked them
[02:52:38] so he works on the second Channel now
[02:52:39] and uh
[02:52:41] reminder he still needs to eat a sock
[02:52:44] because of this comment
[02:52:47] true
[02:52:50] this virgin so yeah we yanked him
[02:52:59] so if you want to feed Mariah you better
[02:53:00] watch the second Channel hey you better
[02:53:02] [ __ ] watch it or he gets no food
[02:53:12] that's not true
[02:53:23] okay we have a thousand resin uh I told
[02:53:25] you guys why I said that my local state
[02:53:28] representative gave us resin because we
[02:53:31] respect copyright laws and that is
[02:53:33] something that you can claim so I
[02:53:34] explained the story earlier in the
[02:53:35] Stream it wasn't because of me I didn't
[02:53:37] refresh my resume I would never do that
[02:53:39] he gave it to me
[02:53:43] uh I'm gonna be soloing Apec with Xiao
[02:53:46] probably next stream so I need to figure
[02:53:48] out what the [ __ ] AP does but before we
[02:53:49] do that let's uh do our daily
[02:53:51] commissions before they do set we'll
[02:53:52] have one left and then we'll start a
[02:53:53] resume
[02:53:55] thank you to everyone who submitted
[02:53:56] their accounts by the way uh the the
[02:53:58] yarisa I appreciate it
[02:54:00] play my best rewards wait true actually
[02:54:03] now surely I claimed them instantly why
[02:54:05] would I wait to claim them that doesn't
[02:54:07] even make sense
[02:54:09] how is Scara Mona farzan and Bennett
[02:54:11] it's good if you replace Mona like
[02:54:13] mono's fine but why are you using her
[02:54:15] there she doesn't really do much like
[02:54:16] she's okay but like why so you could
[02:54:19] like you could do that but I would
[02:54:20] rather do even think show but I'd
[02:54:22] probably do triple Animo or run a shield
[02:54:24] character so you don't hate yourself
[02:54:26] like uh Thomas or Layla or
[02:54:29] Jonathan Lee
[02:54:33] the wind rise
[02:54:48] yeah this is about to reset wait let me
[02:54:50] launch Cyrus so I can do my dailies
[02:54:52] while in the background
[02:54:55] my furnace White Castle what do I tell
[02:54:57] them uh if they're free to play it's
[02:54:59] fine but they probably should stay star
[02:55:01] glitter for black love pole because
[02:55:04] oh I did claim everything because even
[02:55:05] if you're free to play if you love Xiao
[02:55:07] you will save your star glitter for his
[02:55:09] lack of pull now if you need characters
[02:55:11] from the starter glitter shop like
[02:55:12] sincho Beto official
[02:55:14] trangling understandable however you
[02:55:17] still need to block the full
[02:55:22] but there's a few gotcha four stars you
[02:55:24] can use like they might have a gotcha
[02:55:25] four-star like Fab or [ __ ]
[02:55:28] something
[02:55:30] like lithic
[02:55:38] wait my mouse is [ __ ] up oh that's
[02:55:39] what happens when you launch star rail I
[02:55:40] guess
[02:55:47] wait I didn't make kness resin oh I
[02:55:49] guess I just redeemed the voucher for a
[02:55:51] thousand yeah that's why okay well
[02:55:53] [ __ ]
[02:55:56] oh it's kind of our daily commissions
[02:55:57] before it's too late
[02:56:06] thank you
[02:56:10] [Music]
[02:56:22] chat to those of you who watch the
[02:56:24] honkai concert with me last stream do
[02:56:27] you guys like it I thought it was a
[02:56:28] banger but I don't know indeed it's a
[02:56:31] beggar but I swear every time I watch
[02:56:32] Like a music video like not a music
[02:56:34] video like a cinematic or like
[02:56:36] animations like that we're playing
[02:56:38] during the concert it's like it feels
[02:56:41] like literally everyone died why did
[02:56:43] they do that that's dude it's like a
[02:56:47] coaster not the game itself well yeah
[02:56:49] the game but like I feel like even the
[02:56:51] causes like we were reliving traumatic
[02:56:53] memories and then I heard rubia and all
[02:56:55] I could think of was our [ __ ]
[02:56:57] artifacts
[02:57:03] um
[02:57:10] it was good until you started singing
[02:57:14] okay just because you said that we're
[02:57:15] gonna do it for a million run I wasn't
[02:57:16] gonna farm for a million today but just
[02:57:17] because you said we're gonna do one
[02:57:22] I'm holding my account hostage until you
[02:57:24] guys are nice
[02:57:29] [Music]
[02:57:33] I actually don't want to do for a
[02:57:34] million today I want to do like
[02:57:35] something smart to prep for Fountain so
[02:57:37] we're only gonna do one run we'll play
[02:57:38] wander [ __ ] it
[02:57:44] what song is this monster
[02:57:48] too slow
[02:57:50] quit following me
[02:58:02] here's backup

[02:58:10] one Fury
[02:58:18] sorry
[02:58:23] sorry
[02:58:25] but they said hi guys never mind [ __ ]
[02:58:27] you well that was toxic that was the
[02:58:29] first time chatter why did I be mean
[02:58:30] dude why can't
[02:58:34] I was gonna say why can't I be kind this
[02:58:36] is why I can't be kind existence is
[02:58:37] suffering [ __ ] everything okay we're
[02:58:39] gonna go again
[02:58:49] how many Rune graders have you killed
[02:58:52] 2600
[02:58:53] roughly
[02:58:57] we'll make the thousand hundred carers
[02:58:58] on familiar video probably tomorrow like
[02:59:00] next year
[02:59:04] you dare to gaze upon me you dare to
[02:59:07] gaze upon me
[02:59:09] so true
[02:59:11] scaramuki
[02:59:15] can we go to 3 000 shut the [ __ ] up
[02:59:19] I am not going to farm Vermilion purely
[02:59:22] For Your Entertainment I am not a puppet
[02:59:25] I'm not the balladeer
[02:59:35] all right let's literally go dude let's
[02:59:36] go find something smart let's do it
[02:59:38] let's do a little bit um
[02:59:42] okay I would argue this domain isn't
[02:59:44] smart but what if a hydro character from
[02:59:46] Fontan wants nymph [ __ ] it
[02:59:48] I might as well have like a good like
[02:59:50] nymph set okay
[02:59:57] sash I'm just saying there's a chance
[03:00:01] thank you
[03:00:06] that's probably copium they'll probably
[03:00:07] just release a new Hydro set but all
[03:00:09] good
[03:00:16] team
[03:00:32] okay Chad I don't know if I said this on
[03:00:35] stream or off stream I think this was on
[03:00:36] stream actually so you might have heard
[03:00:37] it but I was thinking you know how
[03:00:39] there's like a tick tock NPC Trend what
[03:00:41] if I did that but with genshin and star
[03:00:43] rail character voice lines and then
[03:00:45] there's like a filter where you donate
[03:00:46] and it's like it puts a character and
[03:00:48] then I have to voice on them and I'm
[03:00:49] like an NPC
[03:00:56] Covenant of the deep I could do it I
[03:00:59] actually could do it I actually could do
[03:01:00] it
[03:01:08] I want to do a bit stairs to get footage
[03:01:11] but at this resets I'm like literally
[03:01:13] like now so I might as well wait till
[03:01:14] tomorrow and then do the new Abyss well
[03:01:16] it's the same Abyss it's not new but
[03:01:17] might as well just like you know
[03:01:23] in this domain
[03:01:25] what if I play nilu Gloom with casual
[03:01:29] surely nilu's passes will still work
[03:01:31] right
[03:01:41] don't hate me but we did make a tick
[03:01:44] tock I didn't upload on it I don't know
[03:01:45] if I ever will but since we're making so
[03:01:48] many YouTube shorts that are bangers we
[03:01:49] might as well re-upload them and by we I
[03:01:51] mean Alan
[03:01:52] so go follow it thanks
[03:01:55] I don't know if I'm ever gonna post on
[03:01:57] it but I might so expect it
[03:02:01] what even is the ad
[03:02:03] real ziox gotta link it oh no shut the
[03:02:07] [ __ ] up if you guys are nice it'll be
[03:02:09] all everything will be fine
[03:02:11] this could be good right okay damage or
[03:02:13] am I coping
[03:02:16] I'm gonna try it
[03:02:17] how do you always have resin Okay so
[03:02:19] I didn't play gungeon for a few days
[03:02:21] well I played on my free to play count
[03:02:22] but what happened on my main account is
[03:02:24] that enough time so I actually went
[03:02:25] outside and someone gave me a voucher
[03:02:27] for a thousand resin because I learned
[03:02:28] in my copyright class the copyright law
[03:02:31] class that if you follow fair use
[03:02:33] guidelines uh you can actually claim a
[03:02:35] reward at your local representative so I
[03:02:37] asked him and he gave me a thousand
[03:02:38] resin
[03:02:41] foreign
[03:02:46] artifacts when strongbox
[03:02:49] if strongbox it obviously gets outdated
[03:02:51] as oh
[03:02:53] my God maybe it's a sign maybe dude
[03:02:56] maybe we're gonna be at noviette Main
[03:02:57] maybe we're gonna be a navient gamer
[03:03:01] hey I mean hey hey I mean if anything
[03:03:04] he's like the AL Haytham of Fontan if
[03:03:07] anything if anything if anything if
[03:03:09] anything everything I've said about item
[03:03:11] is arguably applicable to navient I
[03:03:15] don't know I haven't really seen him yet
[03:03:16] but well we've seen him a bit
[03:03:18] but like
[03:03:25] we'll see
[03:03:34] [Music]
[03:03:37] okay I like what I'm saying so far and
[03:03:40] keep in mind this didn't have create a
[03:03:42] level zero so this is like an Underdog
[03:03:44] Story because all of you [ __ ]
[03:03:46] in chat would have thrown this away it
[03:03:48] would have said oh HP ER I don't [ __ ]
[03:03:49] need that would have thrown it away but
[03:03:51] now look at Doctor Strange calculated
[03:03:54] all of the timelines and this is the one
[03:03:56] where zionics gets lucky because he left
[03:03:58] Vermillion the good ending
[03:04:02] the good ending
[03:04:07] [Music]
[03:04:15] the good ending
[03:04:30] I'm telling you we might be a noviette
[03:04:33] main
[03:04:38] have you heard his voice
[03:04:47] I've heard his voice
[03:04:50] in all four languages
[03:04:56] impression
[03:04:59] I am never yet
[03:05:06] I will make you wet that arrives
[03:05:11] thank you Sandra I don't know I think we
[03:05:12] saw the vision in the trailer if not I
[03:05:13] don't look at leaks I just guessed
[03:05:14] because he looks like it visually he
[03:05:16] looks like that I'll hide them who's
[03:05:17] dendro of the dental region but Hydro
[03:05:18] for the Hydra archon so he's like a simp
[03:05:20] like no I don't know for who but he's
[03:05:22] like a Hydra archon like a subordinate
[03:05:24] and he's like I am the ark Khan's friend
[03:05:26] and then he defends the region and then
[03:05:28] he
[03:05:33] and then risley's there
[03:05:35] grizzly bear
[03:05:43] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[03:05:45] this is good and bad it's good because
[03:05:47] we got crit damage but it's bad because
[03:05:49] now my story about navias can be clipped
[03:05:51] and I don't want that
[03:06:00] wait okay can we talk about the comeback
[03:06:03] story about how this piece didn't even
[03:06:05] have Chris damage at level zero and
[03:06:07] everyone in chat would have thrown it
[03:06:09] away to the sidelines to the ashes
[03:06:15] this is why Chad let this be a lesson
[03:06:17] you always roll your plus zero circlets
[03:06:19] if they'll have three stats no matter
[03:06:20] what always now with that in mind
[03:06:24] it's not even plus 20 yet song name
[03:06:26] Reborn
[03:06:53] what rhymes with neviette serve yet
[03:07:04] um
[03:07:05] baguette doesn't really rhyme because
[03:07:07] it's yet it's not get it's different
[03:07:24] sounds like navet or Navy or whatever
[03:07:27] the [ __ ] and that means turnip so
[03:07:29] technically he's a turnip and nahida is
[03:07:31] a radish which means Nikita is the
[03:07:33] deadro archon navient is a turnip which
[03:07:36] is similar to radish which means he's
[03:07:37] kind of like an archon so theoretically
[03:07:39] he's like he's like a hydro archon like
[03:07:43] the real one
[03:07:47] foreign
[03:07:49] I can't I'm just gonna roll and just
[03:07:51] whatever happens happens but like
[03:08:04] wait actually not bad
[03:08:07] for like it's a hydro set so 100
[03:08:09] character might want okay it's dude this
[03:08:11] is still insane a hydro set a lot of
[03:08:13] hydrogate is one HP
[03:08:21] hey maybe one HP
[03:08:24] movies like uh yes my friend
[03:08:27] I want Health that was a terrible accent
[03:08:30] I regret everything
[03:08:32] emblem
[03:08:36] oh offset but I have a good offset
[03:08:38] emblem
[03:08:43] yeah we have an HP roll ER 26 for damage
[03:08:46] really good obviously another damage
[03:08:47] would have been sick but who cares
[03:08:48] pretty good
[03:08:50] very good actually not just pretty good
[03:08:52] so let this be a lesson don't judge a
[03:08:55] book by its cover
[03:08:58] and always roll your circles level zero
[03:09:01] if they uh have three stats also
[03:09:04] yeah my alerts are still off I'm sorry I
[03:09:06] was like I thought I just got no subs so
[03:09:08] notify those hundred bits yeah they were
[03:09:10] off because I was doing a good idea
[03:09:11] review I'm sorry uh thanks for all the
[03:09:13] follows Lord berserk thanks to a prime
[03:09:15] Booth Madness so three months

[03:09:23] other subs thank you I appreciate it pop

[03:09:29] that was one run dude we did

[03:09:33] one run outside of Vermillion literally
[03:09:36] one and we got that
[03:09:40] is this a sign to not Farm Vermillion
[03:09:43] maybe it's because we brought kokomi so
[03:09:44] true
[03:09:46] thank you kokomi
[03:09:49] positions
[03:09:57] a better pill to swallow remember health

[03:10:16] the abyss he never runs me someone
[03:10:17] explain that

[03:11:14] emergency

[03:11:40] mind the side effects taking a turn do
[03:11:44] you even read these you just wasted your
[03:11:46] highlighted message minus 1K
[03:11:57] yeah we're playing with kokomi inside of

[03:12:47] dude actually true
[03:12:49] why is it how yeah it's fine I don't
[03:12:53] want to think about it
[03:13:03] I'm watching your maid of odds on
[03:13:05] YouTube that's AI actually
[03:13:07] that's not me I was getting out of hand
[03:13:18] [Music]
[03:13:28] s
[03:13:33] oh [ __ ] we said we're gonna watch
[03:13:37] wait we said we're gonna watch the
[03:13:39] [ __ ]
[03:13:40] the video with me in it I didn't watch
[03:13:42] this
[03:13:45] uh
[03:13:49] this one guess how much the whale spent
[03:13:52] I'm still gonna watch it I forgore well
[03:13:55] we have like a thousand resin what do I
[03:13:57] do
[03:14:17] seems like an emergency
[03:14:26] water the tree before you claim
[03:14:28] artifacts
[03:14:30] no we just have to use kokomi's burst I
[03:14:32] cracked the code
[03:14:34] that kind of see dodoko when he died
[03:14:37] dodoco
[03:14:45] play in the background picture a picture
[03:14:49] uh no I don't want to like I'm not
[03:14:51] trying to like I'm trying to actually
[03:14:52] watch it like I'm not watching it to
[03:14:53] leech off Kantai I want to watch it and
[03:14:55] I'm in it
[03:14:58] because I have not watched it yet
[03:15:04] you didn't burst that [ __ ] my bad
[03:15:09] watch it now dude I I have
[03:15:12] 100 resin
[03:15:27] remember help comes first
[03:15:33] I wonder why it wasn't even me
[03:15:44] okay let's do it
[03:15:48] just a friendly reminder that four
[03:15:50] points
[03:15:51] this week because the cocoa me Banner
[03:15:53] will hit 10 days this week so it's this
[03:15:55] Saturday I would definitely I will
[03:15:58] definitely stream that Hydro Arkham meta
[03:16:00] soon prayer jelly Ultra
[03:16:03] that could be good
[03:16:23] flower Paradise losses usually better
[03:16:25] than gilded for Bloom but it's like
[03:16:27] pretty small so you go well it could be
[03:16:30] up to ten percent so you just go based
[03:16:32] on sub stats I don't really have flower
[03:16:34] Paradise Lost because that domain is not
[03:16:36] the most efficient so I use gilded
[03:16:37] because Guild is
[03:16:39] broken's gonna like everyone and flop
[03:16:41] kind of flops but if you haven't use it
[03:16:46] yeah but you farm Vermillion yeah but
[03:16:49] vermillions usable on everyone because
[03:16:50] it's hot so technically technically
[03:16:52] Vermillion is smart technically if you
[03:16:54] don't think about it
[03:16:56] the less you think about it the better
[03:16:57] it is
[03:17:06] this guy not dead
[03:17:12] how do they build me for freeze ER HP
[03:17:16] metalith throwing tails you don't need
[03:17:19] ER if you don't want to burst but you
[03:17:20] probably should
[03:17:21] more up time
[03:17:26] boom
[03:17:28] unlucky Ah that's gonna be good
[03:17:48] oh you like that flower it has high
[03:17:49] roller damage what if it rolls create
[03:17:51] then what
[03:17:54] wait should I roll the flower we got
[03:17:55] earlier the side effects seems like an
[03:17:57] emergency
[03:18:00] foreign
[03:18:27] never mind it gave us defense
[03:18:42] wait pause champ
[03:18:45] thank you
[03:18:56] okay never mind
[03:19:04] one second shot I need to uh make sure I
[03:19:06] do these dailies uh okay we did 200 use
[03:19:09] a consumable okay let's uh let's uh use
[03:19:12] the trash thing on blade okay cool all
[03:19:14] right cool
[03:19:15] okay uh
[03:19:17] [Music]
[03:19:21] let's take a photo okay cool
[03:19:26] well minus one of the five I guess but
[03:19:28] all good
[03:19:31] all right cool
[03:19:48] The Daily Nation takes 30 seconds I
[03:19:51] don't have 30 seconds
[03:20:00] to play
[03:20:09] I have to go Auto Battle relics
[03:20:27] dude I have exclamation marks not
[03:20:29] because I'm lazy just because there's
[03:20:30] too many and sometimes some
[03:20:32] constellations I like I don't activate
[03:20:35] so I have to get used to them so I
[03:20:37] stopped noticing them
[03:20:41] I stopped noticing them also
[03:20:44] I don't know
[03:20:45] I don't feel like
[03:20:47] yeah I wish you could talk about
[03:20:48] constellations that would be like the
[03:20:50] biggest quality of life outside of maybe
[03:20:52] like artifact presets although talkable
[03:20:54] constellations is probably better
[03:20:58] not for me for most people yeah artifact
[03:21:01] would be better remember health comes
[03:21:04] actually that's not try a gear for way
[03:21:05] too long never mind that would be better
[03:21:13] mind the side effects oh like I
[03:21:15] literally avoid playing certain
[03:21:17] characters because if I gear them it on
[03:21:19] Gears like two and then it's like not
[03:21:20] worth

[03:26:23] play a game have you gone wild poor
[03:26:25] editor had to watch my whole stream
[03:26:26] probably whoever edited this hello I'm
[03:26:29] sorry on the reviews before you
[03:26:31] definitely have right yeah I did a count
[03:26:33] review of a hundred thousand dollar
[03:26:34] account true okay my chat can't hear you
[03:26:37] hold up that's so cool
[03:26:40] stop sponsor Toronto here today is
[03:26:44] Express I love expressvpn someone always
[03:26:48] watching you okay yeah
[03:26:51] you guys are watching me
[03:26:53] well with expressvpn you'll always know
[03:26:55] that your privacy is kept safe it's very
[03:26:58] easy to set up noted multiple devices
[03:27:00] and did I mention that it's also oh
[03:27:06] turn the volume up a little and listen
[03:27:08] like you a little in incognito mode
[03:27:10] you're not actually in incognito mode
[03:27:13] like your data is still possibly visible
[03:27:15] to your school your employer is like
[03:27:17] using internet without okay basically
[03:27:20] using the bathroom without a door for
[03:27:23] example your internet service provider
[03:27:24] can see your history but expressvpn can
[03:27:26] funnel your data through encrypt okay so
[03:27:28] they can't see what you're doing
[03:27:32] not only does expressvpn help with
[03:27:34] privacy but it's nice to be able to
[03:27:37] browse content that may not be available
[03:27:40] in True Country specifically okay since
[03:27:42] I'm not sponsored I can say this I think
[03:27:44] that's the best part of my VPN if you
[03:27:45] want to use one like you don't need one
[03:27:47] but because like most browsers okay not
[03:27:50] to lose any potential VPN small [ __ ] but
[03:27:52] also we're not going to skip a sponsor
[03:27:54] segment because go click on it to help
[03:27:55] him out but a lot of browsers already
[03:27:57] have like pretty good encryption so like
[03:27:59] that's usually fine but what is nice
[03:28:01] about you guys is you can like do you
[03:28:03] can like watch like [ __ ] from other
[03:28:04] regions like like Netflix or whatever or
[03:28:07] if you need to like
[03:28:09] you don't want to like Google something
[03:28:10] and it's like the wrong region or
[03:28:11] whatever the [ __ ] so like that can
[03:28:12] actually help
[03:28:16] that was content no it's useful I mean
[03:28:17] like it can be useful it may not be
[03:28:19] available in your countries
[03:28:22] specifically me personally I use it to
[03:28:25] watch anime whatever Guardian was
[03:28:28] released in other countries it was only
[03:28:29] in Netflix Japan so I was able to watch
[03:28:32] it by using expressvpn through there so
[03:28:35] what are you waiting for go to
[03:28:36] expressvpn.com Toronto for three extra
[03:28:40] months oh plus three and for sponsoring

[03:29:08] character so I want you to tell me if
[03:29:09] you think it's me or if you think it's a
[03:29:11] character which characters do you sound

[03:29:15] be me let's get this on board Mika of
[03:29:17] the Knights of devonius true Chad who do
[03:29:20] you think it is what do you think it is
[03:29:22] I think that was Mika
[03:29:24] okay
[03:29:26] why did he keep this in the video
[03:29:30] Grandmaster Jean okay
[03:29:33] there's no way here okay anyways
[03:29:38] here's what we're gonna do I have 10
[03:29:40] weld accounts that we get to review
[03:29:42] together and we get to guess how much
[03:29:44] they spent Whoever has more points at
[03:29:46] the end wait the [ __ ]
[03:29:52] picture and
[03:29:54] and my Santa hat because last not even
[03:29:56] last Last Christmas I gave you my heart
[03:30:00] but not even last Christmas two
[03:30:01] Christmases ago I put a Santa hat on it
[03:30:03] and I never changed it so it still has a
[03:30:05] [ __ ] Santa hat on it
[03:30:09] it's the tweet on the other person's
[03:30:11] account oh God
[03:30:14] okay ar-60 that's at least 1K I know
[03:30:17] there's like free to play players that
[03:30:18] are 60 or 59 or whatever but not there's
[03:30:20] like minimum 1K I'm sure look at their
[03:30:22] shop okay no hate but I feel like a lot
[03:30:25] of people that submit their accounts
[03:30:26] Loki lowball estimate oh true okay like
[03:30:30] they probably spent like five candles
[03:30:31] like yeah I think I spent 1K Okay click
[03:30:33] on click on crystal top up oh that okay
[03:30:37] okay yeah yeah they're definitely wild
[03:30:39] at least 200. I'm thinking dolphin right
[03:30:43] now because they have some of the Skins
[03:30:44] purchased they don't have jeans
[03:30:45] purchased wait you have to take their
[03:30:48] characters though shop first and
[03:30:49] characters I'm just I'm just trying to
[03:30:51] cut oh Jesus
[03:30:57] the good part about
[03:30:59] whatever my brain is is that I forget
[03:31:02] things all the time so whenever like a
[03:31:04] stream happens I don't remember what
[03:31:06] happened in the Stream So when I watch
[03:31:07] Like A compilation of it or a video
[03:31:09] that's edited of the stream I literally
[03:31:11] get to re-experience it like I don't
[03:31:12] remember this [ __ ] account so I don't
[03:31:14] actually know how much this is so I can
[03:31:15] like guess again
[03:31:21] I'm checking every consolation first
[03:31:26] yeah it's a lot of constellations
[03:31:28] oh my God oh my God each one is a couple
[03:31:30] thousand right no yeah actually actually
[03:31:32] yes I wish I could forget basically five
[03:31:37] stars but I probably shouldn't talk over
[03:31:38] myself that's probably confusing I'll
[03:31:39] shut up oh they're really hard to get
[03:31:42] they're super rare this is uh my dad
[03:31:45] works at mihoyo account but there's also
[03:31:46] weapons oh Jesus
[03:31:49] wait R3 okay that's like reasonable I

[03:31:56] inventory okay so this isn't a meadow

[03:33:40] whales don't think bro oh they don't
[03:33:42] have a oh it's the one dollar one never
[03:33:44] mind damn it wasn't worth their time
[03:33:45] buying that yeah actually I don't yeah
[03:33:47] because they have a lot of skins not
[03:33:49] bought honestly check weapons that
[03:33:51] honestly you can tell more that's true
[03:33:52] the weapon the weapons are where it
[03:33:53] costs oh oh okay
[03:33:58] yeah their wife probably
[03:34:00] didn't leave them they're like okay you
[03:34:02] know what control your spending and I
[03:34:04] still love you I gotta look at the
[03:34:05] characters why did I say that T2 Eula
[03:34:08] I'm saying dolphin I'm thinking dolphin
[03:34:10] right now yeah this is a dolphin no C2
[03:34:12] nahida which is like this is a [ __ ]
[03:34:14] Hazel art that's not even edit it in by
[03:34:16] the way I put that to hide the uid
[03:34:18] because I don't want to leak it grant
[03:34:19] that I accidentally showed like five of
[03:34:21] the ten uids but yeah I put the Hazel
[03:34:23] this I didn't leak the uids yeah it was
[03:34:25] just like I pull for characters I like
[03:34:27] but with some constellations I like yeah
[03:34:28] I'm already thinking of my number I
[03:34:30] didn't
[03:34:34] did you should be able to throw Dory in
[03:34:35] the strong box for an artifact of your
[03:34:37] choice true true bottom left see that
[03:34:40] every character they do I always count
[03:34:42] it I don't they don't have bios
[03:34:45] Albedo child what oh okay what call me
[03:34:50] disrespect all right imagine a whaling
[03:34:53] fairy character but not getting shout or
[03:34:54] told me already no I lied I don't
[03:34:58] I'm counting right now three two one
[03:35:02] this [ __ ] was hard though guessing how
[03:35:03] much someone spent is so [ __ ] hard
[03:35:04] because every time they win a 50 50 or
[03:35:06] lose a 50 50 that's like
[03:35:09] twice the money or half the money like
[03:35:10] it's so [ __ ] six points okay and then
[03:35:13] it's also people that submit their
[03:35:14] accounts are likely to be one of the
[03:35:15] extremes like you would want to submit
[03:35:17] it if you're super lucky to be like look
[03:35:18] at my account I only spent like two
[03:35:19] dollars and then you want to submit it
[03:35:21] if you're like super unlucky to complain
[03:35:22] about it I guess five I was gonna guess
[03:35:24] five or six but you went high so I did
[03:35:26] go high damn I went higher 6.9k yeah
[03:35:29] bigger bill
[03:35:32] 2K yeah like how the [ __ ] is that 2K
[03:35:34] okay okay this guy's okay they're
[03:35:37] actually good luck I'm coping they're
[03:35:39] lying no it's five it's five I was right
[03:35:42] the [ __ ] is that 2K look literally look
[03:35:47] look look look look look look look look
[03:35:47] look look each one dude look at all
[03:35:51] these weapons they're like okay you know
[03:35:52] what control your spending and I still
[03:35:54] love you all you're spending this is
[03:35:57] like look
[03:36:00] a lot of [ __ ] weapons
[03:36:03] not at all
[03:36:04] 2K maybe like they could have been super
[03:36:07] lucky like because there's also a lot of
[03:36:09] Primos from playing and [ __ ] so okay
[03:36:11] they're actually good like I'm coping
[03:36:13] they're lying no it's five it's five I
[03:36:15] was right
[03:36:17] one one arm I will not lose chat
[03:36:22] what the [ __ ]
[03:36:26] fire holy they are 60. no they are and
[03:36:30] they have every skin wait did they have
[03:36:31] 360 a lot the last God of C6 Elon too
[03:36:33] was that all those weapons plus C6 Elon
[03:36:36] CC yeah okay I like like okay like maybe
[03:36:40] they're turbo lucky like I'm not calling
[03:36:42] cap because maybe but like how is that
[03:36:44] 2K like list of five stars by the way
[03:36:49] hahaha
[03:36:51] Maybe
[03:36:53] it's not just weapons okay also like
[03:36:55] because it feels like I have like you
[03:36:56] build up weapons over time in terms of
[03:36:58] like standard weapons and battle pass
[03:37:01] ones but like a lot of the those are
[03:37:02] limited five stars they could still be
[03:37:04] really lucky like it happens but
[03:37:06] okay okay this guy is okay they're
[03:37:09] actually deadline I'm coping they're
[03:37:10] lying no it's five it's five I was right
[03:37:15] one one I will not lose chat
[03:37:19] what the [ __ ] this is the craziest tea
[03:37:22] part ever this is fire holy okay r60 no
[03:37:26] day off and they have every skin I just
[03:37:28] officially scanned
[03:37:29] I know my number how did you see that
[03:37:31] what c6kara I know exactly what type of
[03:37:35] person this is what do they call Scara
[03:37:36] it's gonna be something like baby girl I
[03:37:38] don't know what that means
[03:37:40] we're always what the [ __ ] does that
[03:37:42] mean I mean maybe it means that [ __ ] the
[03:37:44] Shuki mean
[03:37:46] also remember okay keep this in mind at
[03:37:49] seven minutes 43 I said
[03:37:51] their scar is gonna be called baby girl
[03:37:53] there's literally us the next scar I
[03:37:55] think is called baby girl it's a baby
[03:37:56] girl what's his boss
[03:38:01] I think I have my guess if if the last
[03:38:03] account was 2K dude there's I see me in
[03:38:07] chat looking wait check weapons out
[03:38:09] what's your last game
[03:38:13] they're not R5 to be fair but that's
[03:38:15] still a lot that is a lot of J Cutters
[03:38:17] it's vase to use Jade cutter on everyone
[03:38:19] though I think that's actually like no
[03:38:20] no Jake Cutters like if not the best
[03:38:22] sword right now wait why did they build
[03:38:24] Rodeo's weapon I don't know who knows
[03:38:27] they definitely refill okay yeah they
[03:38:30] have
[03:38:31] [ __ ] I have a theory that you're
[03:38:33] either lucky on pulls or lucky on
[03:38:35] artifacts and we know that they're wait
[03:38:36] chat why wouldn't you stack Wilkins like
[03:38:38] I get it some people like they don't
[03:38:39] want to spend on like a lot of [ __ ] so
[03:38:40] they'll just buy wild kits when they
[03:38:41] need like a little bit of gems right but
[03:38:43] doesn't that force you to not quit ever
[03:38:45] and then you have to keep logging in
[03:38:47] every day for the rest of your life oh
[03:38:50] honey where are where are you going
[03:38:52] sorry I have to log into against your
[03:38:54] impact
[03:38:59] they're unlucky on artifacts because of
[03:39:01] their bio so I think they're lucky I'm
[03:39:03] pulls so that means yeah so I mean they
[03:39:04] probably just refresh a ton that's
[03:39:06] probably where all their money went
[03:39:07] check the valve pass weapons because I
[03:39:09] think this is an account that buys every
[03:39:10] welcome in every battle pass that's my
[03:39:12] guess for cheaper skins yep yeah I mean
[03:39:14] it makes sounds good I think that's true
[03:39:15] then they buy like yeah yeah all right
[03:39:17] one minute with chat ready oh yeah let's
[03:39:19] go let's go
[03:39:21] three
[03:39:22] two
[03:39:23] one okay 3K
[03:39:34] yeah like if that account dude okay if
[03:39:37] if this I mean I guess there's a lot of
[03:39:39] [ __ ] weapons yeah what did I guess so
[03:39:40] low I don't know I actually don't know
[03:39:44] [ __ ]
[03:39:47] I don't know what to guess anymore I
[03:39:49] don't either I'm gonna cope and say we
[03:39:51] both lost but we definitely both lost
[03:39:54] for sure but I'll take the point yeah
[03:39:58] okay okay
[03:40:01] okay this viewer just shared Insider
[03:40:04] information but since I'm a very fair
[03:40:06] person I will also share it with you he
[03:40:08] said I'm unlucky I've won seven percent
[03:40:10] of my 50 50s
[03:40:14] if you lost seven percent of your 50 50s
[03:40:16] at that point just keep pulling it'll
[03:40:18] even out of it and leave it I'm sorry
[03:40:21] 119 days of Welcome
[03:40:23] 25.00
[03:40:25] each she's a garden so you only see one
[03:40:28] Anita okay you can get C2 come on you're
[03:40:30] lucky leaving out come on just spend
[03:40:32] more I'm kidding don't I just said that
[03:40:33] Jesus Christ oh God
[03:40:36] how many c6s was that do we count it's
[03:40:39] only three Ryden tenari
[03:40:42] [Applause]
[03:40:47] no they've rolled a lot they've rolled a
[03:40:50] lot but they could also roll more if
[03:40:51] they want even though it's like 20K I'm
[03:40:53] just saying
[03:40:54] I'm just saying I'm just saying couple
[03:40:57] are bystanders those are R5 this is a
[03:41:00] lot of rolling then I think it's just a
[03:41:02] standard Banner player like I'm confused
[03:41:04] it's time to talk to our chat
[03:41:06] 30k
[03:41:15] [Music]
[03:41:17] you double the price of everything and
[03:41:19] like I think it yeah double it and give
[03:41:21] it to the next person
[03:41:23] wait Jade spear Zhang Lee
[03:41:27] yeah some alcohol
[03:41:32] same pose we should we should make this
[03:41:34] into a remote dolphin yeah looks like my
[03:41:37] account that's a bit more in some
[03:41:38] accounts but unless I Refinery that's
[03:41:42] kind of questionable oh they said
[03:41:43] they're using this weapon because it
[03:41:45] matches his skin for the event okay but
[03:41:46] get a level 90. okay
[03:41:48] that's clean that's clean that's clean
[03:41:51] all right it says the Jeff and I'll be
[03:41:53] ready yeah yeah I'm talking about Jeff
[03:41:56] yeah
[03:41:58] three what am I standing yo what am I
[03:42:00] doing
[03:42:02] come on four thousand okay I guess five
[03:42:07] against four yeah five it's five it's
[03:42:09] [ __ ] put it on the sound effect wait
[03:42:11] how is that only
[03:42:13] yo I know I guess five but how did I how
[03:42:15] is this only five I mean I guess 5K is a
[03:42:17] lot of [ __ ] money
[03:42:19] yeah I guess it is but I remember raisin
[03:42:21] ninjas told us like each R5 weapon is
[03:42:23] like 1K on average or some [ __ ] but yeah
[03:42:27] this is I should have doubled it
[03:42:31] wait Jade fear Zhang Lee
[03:42:33] yes jungle some album
[03:42:36] three two
[03:42:38] four rc2 C5 okay it's like a dolphin
[03:42:42] yeah yeah looks like my account that's a
[03:42:45] bit more in some accounts but like R2
[03:42:48] haran on a kaya I just saw a royal spear
[03:42:50] oh they said they're using this weapon
[03:42:52] because it matches his skin for the
[03:42:53] event okay but get a level 90. okay wait
[03:42:56] didn't we just watch this
[03:42:59] probably
[03:43:01] oh yeah I went back
[03:43:06] and I'll be ready yeah I'm talking about
[03:43:08] Jack
[03:43:10] wait we already watched this too okay my
[03:43:13] bad I'm dumb
[03:43:15] I don't listen I'm tired I'm really
[03:43:17] tired I don't know why
[03:43:20] wait I mean that's a C6 R5 causal okay
[03:43:23] over 10K that is that's not R5 that is
[03:43:25] C6 cars over though whoa guys wait why
[03:43:29] are they skipping all the mommies stop
[03:43:31] you'll either damn yay one though you
[03:43:33] missed it on yaylon 110 days of welcome
[03:43:36] that is questionable hey
[03:43:43] that's how it is yeah but what if you
[03:43:45] get the five star you have a bit left
[03:43:47] over well you're just single pulling
[03:43:48] everything maybe
[03:43:51] I hate them I think that's the number
[03:43:54] one sign of gosh addiction dude if
[03:43:55] you're like a whale because these
[03:43:56] accounts are whale accounts if you're a
[03:43:58] whale and you have exactly like zero or
[03:44:00] like 20 Primo gems that's like that's a
[03:44:03] red flag you already have like two digit
[03:44:05] Primo gems I mean everyone whales and is
[03:44:07] to spends dude that's how it is yeah but
[03:44:09] what if you get the five star you have a
[03:44:10] bit left over well you're just single
[03:44:12] pulling everything maybe
[03:44:15] I hate them okay of course this person's
[03:44:20] unlucky they have like no c6s within
[03:44:21] like every standard Banner C6 okay what
[03:44:23] about weapons now it's all right they
[03:44:25] look yeah like
[03:44:26] R2 R3 yeah
[03:44:30] I think I think it's a little bit more
[03:44:32] money yeah but also I don't know how
[03:44:34] lucky they are I guess they're unlucky I
[03:44:36] think unlucky because there's a lot of C
[03:44:39] why just because it's like satisfying or
[03:44:42] because you know how many pills you have
[03:44:43] I mean I guess there's not much else to
[03:44:45] do with Primos unless you like resin but
[03:44:47] if I like one Ratio or something
[03:44:50] okay okay
[03:44:52] okay okay okay okay okay okay I'm ready
[03:44:56] ready
[03:44:58] yeah well where's my impulse to wish
[03:45:01] two where did I go one eight and a half
[03:45:05] okay eight thousand oh
[03:45:08] wait did you also say our guesses are so
[03:45:10] close I I guess eight and a half um
[03:45:12] eight point five
[03:45:14] okay okay I was I was thinking seven and
[03:45:16] a half so I'm not happy okay okay
[03:45:23] my guesses are so [ __ ] off
[03:45:27] okay this game sucks all right okay okay
[03:45:30] next account I'm adding 10 to it well
[03:45:33] you look so big because I am
[03:45:35] scar is literally named Scara no wild
[03:45:37] kid no okay they also have 91 Sweden my
[03:45:40] Valor my second Valor account the login
[03:45:42] is like Alpha like Alpha destroyer and
[03:45:45] then a bunch of numbers names only free
[03:45:48] to play players have a lot of food true
[03:45:49] yeah well they bought every pack Oh
[03:45:51] missing a lot of characters
[03:45:53] yeah they're missing like yeah that's
[03:45:55] true by the way Wales don't have time to
[03:45:57] cook right in Sugar let me just buy
[03:46:00] someone to cook for them
[03:46:02] sometimes I okay I'm not even kidding
[03:46:05] I'll wake up and I'll be sad about
[03:46:06] something but then I remember that some
[03:46:07] people play Genji without kazua and I'm
[03:46:09] happy and I'm like why would I be sad
[03:46:11] I'm a casual hover I forget I said that
[03:46:14] Michelle
[03:46:21] you might as well I love it I love it
[03:46:24] what is this Sino this is at the time
[03:46:27] when there's like the scariest sucrose
[03:46:29] like Banner debate thingy it's like it's
[03:46:31] like like super girls is great sucrose
[03:46:33] is like
[03:46:36] the same like basically basically the
[03:46:37] same tier metalizers teams where she's
[03:46:38] better no no but like dude she feels so
[03:46:41] much worse because it's so fun dude
[03:46:43] Hercules like meta so that's fine
[03:46:44] anyways all right let's check weapons
[03:46:46] and you can group every like three
[03:46:47] seconds well not three but like five
[03:46:49] seconds or some [ __ ] I feel like they
[03:46:50] were not well I guess you're holding it
[03:46:52] whatever you get the point wait what
[03:46:53] weapon was alongside Calamity queller
[03:46:55] because no one wants a clown any color
[03:46:57] maybe people want like one but I've
[03:46:58] never met someone who wanted three so
[03:47:00] why do they have three oh miss splitter
[03:47:02] or Jade spear I guess because of missed
[03:47:03] Twitter okay that makes sense oh they
[03:47:04] have an R5 Jade I didn't see that for
[03:47:06] sure that's based I kind of forgot
[03:47:08] everything about this account but I
[03:47:09] remember Scar and ciao so same okay fair
[03:47:12] enough
[03:47:14] three two one nine kids 21. can you do
[03:47:19] something for me you said 21. I was
[03:47:23] thinking 10. oh yeah I'm getting [ __ ]
[03:47:25] up like wait a second if elastic house
[03:47:26] 15 this is 21. Savage what did you say I
[03:47:30] said nine
[03:47:32] okay let's see it here we go Nick said
[03:47:36] 21 I said nine
[03:47:39] yeah
[03:47:41] okay but maybe in my mind I was thinking
[03:47:43] of 12 but my the numbers got mixed up so
[03:47:46] I said two one instead of one two so I
[03:47:48] technically got it 15 I would have lost
[03:47:49] so fair enough
[03:47:51] okay
[03:47:59] what does that mean that's Korean
[03:48:02] like not to tell like their names Korean
[03:48:04] oh I was like oh it's txt oh it's K okay
[03:48:08] there it is oh my God it's a C6 Cara I
[03:48:10] already know C4 okay
[03:48:15] definitely though you just tell their
[03:48:17] new because
[03:48:19] C6 standards this is the one I think
[03:48:24] wait
[03:48:31] let's see
[03:48:42] I see 66 I can't lie yeah this is a lot
[03:48:45] I'm I'm this might be a little hard
[03:48:47] looking how about weapons oh oh it's
[03:48:50] more this is more oh my God C6 R5
[03:48:54] running shotgun
[03:48:59] wait dude look at how he [ __ ] love is
[03:49:01] I remember this account being like
[03:49:02] stupid low look at how many weapons are
[03:49:05] there's an R5 R4
[03:49:07] and then like literally four almost five
[03:49:09] rows of five stars hold on oh my God
[03:49:14] it's Ryden I mean you could call me I
[03:49:17] respect her Triple Crown
[03:49:20] who did they who do they not have
[03:49:22] a decent amount they don't have if
[03:49:24] they're a K-pop stand this is 20K easy
[03:49:26] I'm talking to Chad it's time to chat
[03:49:28] okay sure
[03:49:30] three two one seventy thousand seventeen
[03:49:34] what do you say I said 17. wow group
[03:49:40] all right here we go we both said 17.
[03:49:44] yeah like there is no way if it's
[03:49:47] actually 1500 I will eat a sock then
[03:49:50] then blend another one drink it and then
[03:49:52] with a third one I will literally wrap
[03:49:55] it over my keyboard and then use that as
[03:49:57] my keyboard I might be honest I don't
[03:49:59] know if this is wrong it says 1500. okay
[03:50:03] yeah surely yeah surely anyways we guess
[03:50:06] the same thing so it's yeah it doesn't
[03:50:08] matter
[03:50:09] okay
[03:50:10] wait did it even explain okay there's
[03:50:13] like a part of that where they said they
[03:50:14] actually ended up it was a bit more but
[03:50:16] it yeah anyways and then they I think he
[03:50:19] gave me the I think I got a point here
[03:50:20] he just gave it to me at a Pity
[03:50:21] certainly they didn't really explain it
[03:50:23] but it's the same thing so I just got a
[03:50:25] Pity point it doesn't matter
[03:50:28] the Mad 15 no we asked about it they
[03:50:29] said like three or something or like
[03:50:31] five but yeah it was definitely more
[03:50:33] last account bro I said check my map
[03:50:36] wait why do they want me to check them
[03:50:38] out
[03:50:39] oh what what the [ __ ] what this was not
[03:50:41] what is this I can't even load it it's
[03:50:43] lagging what they drew
[03:50:45] okay size zero I have a question are you
[03:50:48] also spending 120k resin on the blade
[03:50:51] set the million
[03:50:53] my blade actually has a good Vermillion
[03:50:54] already I have a question why can't you
[03:50:57] guys do this
[03:50:58] look at how wholesome and talented
[03:51:00] Jake's yours are what the [ __ ] have you
[03:51:02] guys done
[03:51:04] you guys just come and chat with a name
[03:51:06] like Dad hung sweat and then type some
[03:51:09] dumb [ __ ]
[03:51:12] freak you
[03:51:16] you gotta be wholesome as well I am
[03:51:18] wholesome
[03:51:20] I'm nice
[03:51:25] oh it's so cute that's cool so what did
[03:51:28] you run an odd not during his video
[03:51:30] after I'm not gonna run it after his
[03:51:32] video wait the pin message unpinned what
[03:51:35] the [ __ ] yeah I'll repin it reap in the
[03:51:38] video
[03:51:42] okay nice GG I I don't know what to
[03:51:46] think of his account right now can you
[03:51:47] imagine this account's 1500. there's
[03:51:49] just this could actually be 1500 account
[03:51:51] we have to check how many passes they're
[03:51:53] missing too because I'm not sure are you
[03:51:55] a bizu yai Ryden kokumi yo Mia Albedo
[03:51:58] clip like this is a good account but I
[03:51:59] don't think it's like that high spending
[03:52:01] yeah I don't think it's the high
[03:52:02] spending that's a decent amount of
[03:52:04] weapons at least but do they have any
[03:52:06] five star cons I actually forget they
[03:52:08] had like maybe yeah this was like I mean
[03:52:12] there's Gene C3
[03:52:14] C6 okay is this someone who Loki spends
[03:52:16] and then [ __ ] closes the game look
[03:52:18] they had like a they have a much faster
[03:52:19] just they're like not level like 70 and
[03:52:21] then I guess 60. okay
[03:52:32] without ratio because that means they
[03:52:34] don't play her if they do play her
[03:52:37] okay bro you might want to change your
[03:52:40] booklet
[03:52:43] they're just a murmur I respect it but
[03:52:46] not a spender I took the top boat nah
[03:52:49] the more memer the more slender it's
[03:52:50] 200. at least 200. okay well
[03:52:54] I guess you can take a minute yeah
[03:52:59] three two one eighteen hundred what do
[03:53:04] you say I said 800. I said 1800. dude
[03:53:06] because there's so many limited
[03:53:07] five-star weapons that I feel like
[03:53:09] definitely more and I feel like they
[03:53:11] didn't play that much but I could also
[03:53:12] see it being like twenty dollars so
[03:53:14] we'll see yeah there were weapons huh oh
[03:53:17] wait apparently there's no battle pass
[03:53:18] weapons okay maybe I agree wait check
[03:53:21] that before you reveal oh no I don't see
[03:53:23] it oh no dude no your turn I mean uh
[03:53:27] reveal reveal
[03:53:51] I think it does add up though that it's
[03:53:53] like they probably don't play a lot and
[03:53:55] they pull out what they like wait that
[03:53:57] means we're tied oh yeah I mean I kind
[03:53:58] of got two of them by default but yeah
[03:54:00] it doesn't mean we're tired that is true
[03:54:12] we should do something I have an idea
[03:54:16] tweet wait was that what he said that's
[03:54:18] what I said okay okay
[03:54:21] well chat think of a tweet I haven't
[03:54:24] talked about it dude this thing [ __ ]
[03:54:25] me okay it it like people realize after
[03:54:28] a bit but he made me tweet something he
[03:54:30] was rude to his chat at least it was
[03:54:32] [ __ ] ruthless and I have to tweet
[03:54:33] something and people didn't know it was
[03:54:34] a meme people didn't get it for a bit
[03:54:36] and then I saw it posted on Reddit I saw
[03:54:38] someone post it on like YouTube like
[03:54:40] post thing and then the replies were
[03:54:43] like I'm so happy ziox is being honest
[03:54:46] now yeah Xiao got boring after a bit I'm
[03:54:48] happy he's playing who he likes the most
[03:54:50] and being honest no the [ __ ] it was a
[03:54:53] joke I like show
[03:54:57] account
[03:55:01] are you shine Chad yet are you just
[03:55:03] tweeting I'm just gonna tweet it and
[03:55:04] then show them okay five four three two
[03:55:09] one

[03:55:21] this but it said honestly don't like
[03:55:22] shout anymore he's honest he's kind of
[03:55:24] annoying and short I literally just play
[03:55:26] him for the brand like dude what
[03:55:28] that is not true
[03:55:30] I would do unspeakable I would love to
[03:55:33] play I challenge um I like playing ciao
[03:55:36] but I would much rather not play from
[03:55:37] now on if you had better plus dollar
[03:55:40] Jake and this okay to be fair I kind of
[03:55:42] dug my own grave because Jake initially
[03:55:43] said he put Gene better plus taller he
[03:55:46] added that so that it wasn't as like
[03:55:47] damaging but then I said that doesn't
[03:55:50] look convincing so I changed Gene to
[03:55:52] nive yet

[04:03:44] recording at like 20K bitrate I don't
[04:03:46] know if you can tell the difference or
[04:03:48] if it's Placebo but I did do like a test
[04:03:51] clip where I recorded at 20K bitrate and
[04:03:54] I wonder if it'll make background
[04:03:56] footage a bit clearer
[04:03:58] um
[04:04:03] trying to find a clip to show you guys
[04:04:08] [Music]
